an
introductory
word
to
the
reader
just
about
a
year
ago
my
old
friend
jules
simon
author
of
devoir
came
to
me
with
a
request
that
i
write
a
novel
for
the
journal
pour
i
gave
him
the
outline
of
a
novel
which
i
had
in
mind
the
subject
pleased
him
and
the
contract
was
signed
on
the
spot
the
action
occurred
between
and
and
the
first
chapter
opened
at
varennes
the
evening
of
the
king
s
arrest
only
impatient
as
was
the
journal
pour
tous
i
demanded
a
fortnight
of
jules
simon
before
beginning
my
novel
i
wished
to
go
to
varennes
i
was
not
acquainted
with
the
locality
and
i
confess
there
is
one
thing
i
can
not
do
i
am
unable
to
write
a
novel
or
a
drama
about
localities
with
which
i
am
not
familiar
in
order
to
write
christine
i
went
to
fontainebleau
in
writing
henri
i
went
to
blois
for
les
trois
mousquetaires
i
went
to
boulogne
and
béthune
for
i
returned
to
the
catalans
and
the
château
d
if
for
isaac
laquedem
i
revisited
rome
and
i
certainly
spent
more
time
studying
jerusalem
and
corinth
from
a
distance
than
if
i
had
gone
there
this
gives
such
a
character
of
veracity
to
all
that
i
write
that
the
personages
whom
i
create
become
eventually
such
integral
parts
of
the
places
in
which
i
planted
them
that
as
a
consequence
many
end
by
believing
in
their
actual
existence
there
are
even
some
people
who
claim
to
have
known
them
in
this
connection
dear
readers
i
am
going
to
tell
you
something
in
confidence
only
do
not
repeat
it
i
do
not
wish
to
injure
honest
fathers
of
families
who
live
by
this
little
industry
but
if
you
go
to
marseilles
you
will
be
shown
there
the
house
of
morel
on
the
cours
the
house
of
mercédès
at
the
catalans
and
the
dungeons
of
dantès
and
faria
at
the
château
d
if
when
i
staged
at
the
i
wrote
to
marseilles
for
a
plan
of
the
château
d
if
which
was
sent
to
me
this
drawing
was
for
the
use
of
the
scene
painter
the
artist
to
whom
i
had
recourse
forwarded
me
the
desired
plan
he
even
did
better
than
i
would
have
dared
ask
of
him
he
wrote
beneath
it
view
of
the
château
d
if
from
the
side
where
dantès
was
thrown
into
the
i
have
learned
since
that
a
worthy
man
a
guide
attached
to
the
château
d
if
sells
pens
made
of
by
the
abbé
faria
himself
there
is
but
one
unfortunate
circumstance
concerning
this
the
fact
is
dantès
and
the
abbé
faria
have
never
existed
save
in
my
imagination
consequently
dantès
could
not
have
been
precipitated
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
the
château
d
if
nor
could
the
abbé
faria
have
made
pens
but
that
is
what
comes
from
visiting
these
localities
in
person
therefore
i
wished
to
visit
varennes
before
commencing
my
novel
because
the
first
chapter
was
to
open
in
that
city
besides
historically
varennes
worried
me
considerably
the
more
i
perused
the
historical
accounts
of
varennes
the
less
i
was
able
to
understand
topographically
the
king
s
arrest
i
therefore
proposed
to
my
young
friend
paul
bocage
that
he
accompany
me
to
varennes
i
was
sure
in
advance
that
he
would
accept
to
merely
propose
such
a
trip
to
his
picturesque
and
charming
mind
was
to
make
him
bound
from
his
chair
to
the
tram
we
took
the
railroad
to
châlons
there
we
bargained
with
a
keeper
who
agreed
for
a
consideration
of
ten
francs
a
day
to
furnish
us
with
a
horse
and
carriage
we
were
seven
days
on
the
trip
three
days
to
go
from
châlons
to
varennes
one
day
to
make
the
requisite
local
researches
in
the
city
and
three
days
to
return
from
varennes
to
châlons
i
recognized
with
a
degree
of
satisfaction
which
you
will
easily
comprehend
that
not
a
single
historian
had
been
historical
and
with
still
greater
satisfaction
that
thiers
had
been
the
least
accurate
of
all
these
historians
i
had
already
suspected
this
but
was
not
certain
the
only
one
who
had
been
accurate
with
absolute
accuracy
was
victor
hugo
in
his
book
called
the
it
is
true
that
victor
hugo
is
a
poet
and
not
a
historian
what
historians
these
poets
would
make
if
they
would
but
consent
to
become
historians
one
day
lamartine
asked
me
to
what
i
attributed
the
immense
success
of
his
histoire
des
to
this
because
in
it
you
rose
to
the
level
of
a
novel
i
answered
him
he
reflected
for
a
while
and
ended
i
believe
by
agreeing
with
me
i
spent
a
day
therefore
at
varennes
and
visited
all
the
localities
necessary
for
my
novel
which
was
to
be
called
rené
d
then
i
returned
my
son
was
staying
in
the
country
at
near
melun
my
room
awaited
me
and
i
resolved
to
go
there
to
write
my
novel
i
am
acquainted
with
no
two
characters
more
dissimilar
than
alexandre
s
and
mine
which
nevertheless
harmonize
so
well
it
is
true
we
pass
many
enjoyable
hours
during
our
separations
but
none
i
think
pleasanter
than
those
we
spend
together
i
had
been
installed
there
for
three
or
four
days
endeavoring
to
begin
my
rené
d
argonne
taking
up
my
pen
then
laying
it
aside
almost
immediately
the
thing
would
not
go
i
consoled
myself
by
telling
stories
chance
willed
that
i
should
relate
one
which
nodier
had
told
me
of
four
young
men
affiliated
with
the
company
of
jehu
who
had
been
executed
at
bourg
in
bresse
amid
the
most
dramatic
circumstances
one
of
these
four
young
men
he
who
had
found
the
greatest
difficulty
in
dying
or
rather
he
whom
they
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
killing
was
but
nineteen
and
a
half
years
old
alexandre
listened
to
my
story
with
much
interest
when
i
had
finished
do
you
know
said
he
what
i
should
do
in
your
place
what
i
should
lay
aside
rené
d
argonne
which
refuses
to
materialize
and
in
its
stead
i
should
write
the
companions
of
but
just
think
i
have
had
that
other
novel
in
mind
for
a
year
or
two
and
it
is
almost
it
never
will
be
since
it
is
not
finished
perhaps
you
are
right
but
i
shall
lose
six
months
regaining
my
present
good
in
three
days
you
will
have
written
half
a
then
you
will
help
yes
for
i
shall
give
you
two
is
that
all
you
are
too
exacting
the
rest
is
your
affair
i
am
busy
with
my
question
d
well
who
are
your
two
characters
then
an
english
gentleman
and
a
french
introduce
the
englishman
very
and
alexandre
drew
lord
tanlay
s
portrait
for
me
your
english
gentleman
pleases
me
said
i
now
let
us
see
your
french
my
french
captain
is
a
mysterious
character
who
courts
death
with
all
his
might
without
being
able
to
accomplish
his
desire
so
that
each
time
he
rushes
into
mortal
danger
he
performs
some
brilliant
feat
which
secures
him
but
why
does
he
wish
to
get
himself
killed
because
he
is
disgusted
with
why
is
he
disgusted
with
life
ah
that
will
be
the
secret
of
the
it
must
be
told
in
the
on
the
contrary
i
in
your
place
would
not
tell
the
readers
will
demand
you
will
reply
that
they
have
only
to
search
for
it
you
must
leave
them
something
to
do
these
readers
of
dear
friend
i
shall
be
overwhelmed
with
you
need
not
answer
yes
but
for
my
personal
gratification
i
at
least
must
know
why
my
hero
longs
to
oh
i
do
not
refuse
to
tell
let
me
hear
well
suppose
instead
of
being
professor
of
dialectics
abelard
had
been
a
well
well
let
us
suppose
that
a
bullet
excellent
you
understand
instead
of
withdrawing
to
paraclet
he
would
have
courted
death
at
every
possible
hum
that
will
be
difficult
in
what
way
to
make
the
public
swallow
but
since
you
are
not
going
to
tell
the
that
is
true
by
my
faith
i
believe
you
are
right
i
am
have
you
nodier
s
souvenirs
de
la
révolution
i
believe
he
wrote
one
or
two
pages
about
guyon
leprêtre
amiet
and
they
will
say
then
that
you
have
plagiarized
from
oh
he
loved
me
well
enough
during
his
life
not
to
refuse
me
whatever
i
shall
take
from
him
after
his
death
go
fetch
me
the
souvenirs
de
la
alexandre
brought
me
the
book
i
opened
it
turned
over
two
or
three
pages
and
at
last
discovered
what
i
was
looking
for
a
little
of
nodier
dear
readers
you
will
lose
nothing
by
it
it
is
he
who
is
speaking
the
highwaymen
who
attacked
the
diligences
as
mentioned
in
the
article
on
amiet
which
i
quoted
just
now
were
called
leprêtre
hyvert
guyon
and
amiet
leprêtre
was
years
old
he
was
formerly
a
captain
of
dragoons
a
knight
of
louis
of
a
noble
countenance
prepossessing
carriage
and
much
elegance
of
manner
guyon
and
amiet
have
never
been
known
by
their
real
names
they
owe
that
to
the
accommodating
spirit
prevailing
among
the
vendors
of
passports
of
those
days
let
the
reader
picture
to
himself
two
between
twenty
and
thirty
years
of
age
allied
by
some
common
responsibility
the
sequence
perhaps
of
some
misdeed
or
by
a
more
delicate
and
generous
interest
the
fear
of
compromising
their
family
name
then
you
will
know
of
guyon
and
amiet
all
that
i
can
recall
the
latter
had
a
sinister
countenance
to
which
perhaps
he
owes
the
bad
reputation
with
which
all
his
biographers
have
credited
him
hyvert
was
the
son
of
a
rich
merchant
of
lyons
who
had
offered
the
charged
with
his
deportation
sixty
thousand
francs
to
permit
his
escape
he
was
at
once
the
achilles
and
the
paris
of
the
band
he
was
of
medium
height
but
well
formed
lithe
and
of
graceful
and
pleasing
address
his
eyes
were
never
without
animation
nor
his
lips
without
a
smile
his
was
one
of
those
countenances
which
are
never
forgotten
and
which
present
an
inexpressible
blending
of
sweetness
and
strength
tenderness
and
energy
when
he
yielded
to
the
eloquent
petulance
of
his
inspirations
he
soared
to
enthusiasm
his
conversation
revealed
the
rudiments
of
an
excellent
early
education
and
much
natural
intelligence
that
which
was
so
terrifying
in
him
was
his
tone
of
heedless
gayety
which
contrasted
so
horribly
with
his
position
for
the
rest
he
was
unanimously
conceded
to
be
kind
generous
humane
lenient
toward
the
weak
while
with
the
strong
he
loved
to
display
a
vigor
truly
athletic
which
his
somewhat
effeminate
features
were
far
from
indicating
he
boasted
that
he
had
never
been
without
money
and
had
no
enemies
that
was
his
sole
reply
to
the
charges
of
theft
and
assassination
he
was
years
old
to
these
four
men
was
intrusted
the
attack
upon
a
diligence
conveying
forty
thousand
francs
of
government
money
this
deed
was
transacted
in
broad
daylight
with
an
exchange
of
mutual
courtesy
almost
and
the
travellers
who
were
not
disturbed
by
the
attack
gave
little
heed
to
it
but
a
child
of
only
ten
years
of
age
with
reckless
bravado
seized
the
pistol
of
the
conductor
and
fired
it
into
the
midst
of
the
assailants
as
this
peaceful
weapon
according
to
the
custom
was
only
charged
with
powder
no
one
was
injured
but
the
occupants
of
the
coach
quite
naturally
experienced
a
lively
fear
of
reprisals
the
little
boy
s
mother
fell
into
violent
hysterics
this
new
disturbance
created
a
general
diversion
which
dominated
all
the
preceding
events
and
particularly
attracted
the
attention
of
the
robbers
one
of
them
flew
to
the
woman
s
side
reassuring
her
in
the
most
affectionate
manner
while
complimenting
her
upon
her
son
s
precocious
courage
and
courteously
pressed
upon
her
the
salts
and
perfumes
with
which
these
gentlemen
were
ordinarily
provided
for
their
own
use
she
regained
consciousness
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
her
travelling
companions
noticed
that
the
highwayman
s
mask
had
fallen
off
but
they
did
not
see
his
face
the
police
of
those
days
restricted
to
mere
impotent
supervision
were
unable
to
cope
with
the
depredations
of
these
banditti
although
they
did
not
lack
the
means
to
follow
them
up
appointments
were
made
at
the
cafés
and
narratives
relating
to
deeds
carrying
with
them
the
penalty
of
death
circulated
freely
through
all
the
in
the
land
such
was
the
importance
which
the
culprits
and
the
public
attached
to
the
police
these
men
of
blood
and
terror
assembled
in
society
in
the
evening
and
discussed
their
nocturnal
expeditions
as
if
they
had
been
mere
leprêtre
hyvert
amiet
and
guyon
were
arraigned
before
the
tribunal
of
a
neighboring
department
no
one
save
the
treasury
had
suffered
from
their
attack
and
there
was
no
one
to
identify
them
save
the
lady
who
took
very
good
care
not
to
do
so
they
were
therefore
acquitted
unanimously
nevertheless
the
evidence
against
them
so
obviously
called
for
conviction
that
the
ministry
was
forced
to
appeal
from
this
decision
the
verdict
was
set
aside
but
such
was
the
government
s
vacillation
that
it
hesitated
to
punish
excesses
that
might
on
the
morrow
be
regarded
as
virtues
the
accused
were
cited
before
the
tribunal
of
ain
in
the
city
of
bourg
where
dwelt
a
majority
of
their
friends
relatives
abettors
and
accomplices
the
ministry
sought
to
propitiate
the
one
party
by
the
return
of
its
victims
and
the
other
by
the
almost
inviolate
safeguards
with
which
it
surrounded
the
prisoners
the
return
to
prison
indeed
resembled
nothing
less
than
a
triumph
the
trial
recommenced
it
was
at
first
attended
by
the
same
results
as
the
preceding
one
the
four
accused
were
protected
by
an
alibi
patently
false
but
attested
by
a
hundred
signatures
and
for
which
they
could
easily
have
obtained
ten
thousand
all
moral
convictions
must
fail
in
the
presence
of
such
authoritative
testimony
an
acquittal
seemed
certain
when
a
question
perhaps
involuntarily
insidious
from
the
president
changed
the
aspect
of
the
trial
madam
said
he
to
the
lady
who
had
been
so
kindly
assisted
by
one
of
the
highwaymen
which
of
these
men
was
it
who
tendered
you
such
thoughtful
attention
this
unexpected
form
of
interrogation
confused
her
ideas
it
is
probable
that
she
believed
the
facts
to
be
known
and
saw
in
this
a
means
of
modifying
the
fate
of
the
man
who
interested
her
it
was
that
gentleman
said
she
pointing
to
leprêtre
the
four
accused
who
were
included
in
a
common
alibi
fell
by
this
one
admission
under
the
executioner
s
axe
they
rose
and
bowed
to
her
with
a
smile
faith
said
hyvert
falling
back
upon
his
bench
with
a
burst
of
laughter
that
captain
will
teach
you
to
play
the
i
have
heard
it
said
that
the
unhappy
lady
died
shortly
after
of
chagrin
the
customary
appeal
followed
but
this
time
there
was
little
hope
the
republican
party
which
napoleon
annihilated
a
month
later
was
in
the
ascendency
that
of
the
was
compromised
by
its
odious
excesses
the
people
demanded
examples
and
matters
were
arranged
accordingly
as
is
ordinarily
the
custom
in
strenuous
times
for
it
is
with
governments
as
with
men
the
weakest
are
always
the
most
cruel
nor
had
the
companies
of
jehu
longer
an
organized
existence
the
heroes
of
these
ferocious
bands
debeauce
hastier
bary
le
coq
dabri
delbourbe
and
storkenfeld
had
either
fallen
on
the
scaffold
or
elsewhere
the
condemned
could
look
for
no
further
assistance
from
the
daring
courage
of
these
exhausted
devotees
who
no
longer
capable
of
protecting
their
own
lives
coolly
sacrificed
them
as
did
piard
after
a
merry
supper
our
brigands
were
doomed
to
die
their
appeal
was
rejected
but
the
municipal
authorities
were
not
the
first
to
learn
of
this
the
condemned
men
were
warned
by
three
shots
fired
beneath
the
walls
of
their
dungeon
the
commissioner
of
the
executive
directory
who
had
assumed
the
rôle
of
public
prosecutor
at
the
trial
alarmed
at
this
obvious
sign
of
connivance
requisitioned
a
squad
of
armed
men
of
whom
my
uncle
was
then
commander
at
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
sixty
horsemen
were
drawn
up
before
the
iron
gratings
of
the
prison
yard
although
the
jailers
had
observed
all
possible
precautions
in
entering
the
dungeon
where
these
four
unfortunate
men
were
confined
and
whom
they
had
left
the
preceding
day
tightly
pinioned
and
heavily
loaded
with
chains
they
were
unable
to
offer
them
a
prolonged
resistance
the
prisoners
were
free
and
armed
to
the
teeth
they
came
forth
without
difficulty
leaving
their
guardians
under
bolts
and
bars
and
supplied
with
the
keys
they
quickly
traversed
the
space
that
separated
them
from
the
prison
yard
their
appearance
must
have
been
terrifying
to
the
populace
awaiting
them
before
the
iron
gates
to
assure
perfect
freedom
of
action
or
perhaps
to
affect
an
appearance
of
security
more
menacing
even
than
the
renown
for
strength
and
intrepidity
with
which
their
names
were
associated
or
possibly
even
to
conceal
the
flow
of
blood
which
reveals
itself
so
readily
beneath
white
linen
and
betrays
the
last
agonies
of
a
mortally
wounded
man
their
breasts
were
bared
their
braces
crossed
upon
the
chest
their
wide
red
belts
bristling
with
arms
their
cry
of
attack
and
rage
all
that
must
have
given
a
decidedly
fantastic
touch
to
the
scene
arrived
in
the
square
they
perceived
the
gendarmerie
drawn
up
in
motionless
ranks
through
which
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
force
a
passage
they
halted
an
instant
and
seemed
to
consult
together
leprêtre
who
was
as
i
have
said
their
senior
and
their
chief
saluted
the
guard
with
his
hand
saying
with
that
noble
grace
of
manner
peculiar
to
him
very
well
gentlemen
of
the
gendarmerie
then
after
a
brief
energetic
farewell
to
his
comrades
he
stepped
in
front
of
them
and
blew
out
his
brains
guyon
amiet
and
hyvert
assumed
a
defensive
position
their
pistols
levelled
upon
their
armed
opponents
they
did
not
fire
but
the
latter
considering
this
demonstration
as
a
sign
of
open
hostility
fired
upon
them
guyon
fell
dead
upon
leprêtre
s
body
which
had
not
moved
amiet
s
hip
was
broken
near
the
groin
the
biographie
des
contemporains
says
that
he
was
executed
i
have
often
heard
it
said
that
he
died
at
the
foot
of
the
scaffold
hyvert
was
left
alone
his
determined
brow
his
terrible
eye
the
pistol
in
each
practiced
and
vigorous
hand
threatening
death
to
the
spectators
perhaps
it
was
involuntary
admiration
in
his
desperate
plight
for
this
handsome
young
man
with
his
waving
locks
who
was
known
never
to
have
shed
blood
and
from
whom
the
law
now
demanded
the
expiation
of
blood
or
perhaps
it
was
the
sight
of
those
three
corpses
over
which
he
sprang
like
a
wolf
overtaken
by
his
hunters
and
the
frightful
novelty
of
the
spectacle
which
for
an
instant
restrained
the
fury
of
the
troop
he
perceived
this
and
temporized
with
them
for
a
compromise
gentlemen
said
he
i
go
to
my
death
i
die
with
all
my
heart
but
let
no
one
approach
me
or
i
shall
shoot
him
except
this
gentleman
he
continued
pointing
to
the
executioner
this
is
an
affair
that
concerns
us
alone
and
merely
needs
a
certain
understanding
between
this
concession
was
readily
accorded
for
there
was
no
one
present
who
was
not
suffering
from
the
prolongation
of
this
horrible
tragedy
and
anxious
to
see
it
finished
perceiving
their
assent
he
placed
one
of
his
pistols
between
his
teeth
and
drawing
a
dagger
from
his
belt
plunged
it
in
his
breast
up
to
the
hilt
he
still
remained
standing
and
seemed
greatly
surprised
there
was
a
movement
toward
him
very
well
gentlemen
cried
he
covering
the
men
who
sought
to
surround
him
with
his
pistols
which
he
had
seized
again
while
the
blood
spurted
freely
from
the
wound
in
which
he
had
left
his
poniard
you
know
our
agreement
either
i
die
alone
or
three
of
us
will
die
together
forward
march
he
walked
straight
to
the
guillotine
turning
the
knife
in
his
breast
as
he
did
so
faith
said
he
my
soul
must
be
centred
in
my
belly
i
can
not
die
see
if
you
can
fetch
it
this
last
was
addressed
to
his
executioner
an
instant
later
his
head
fell
be
it
accident
or
some
peculiar
phenomenon
of
the
vitality
it
rebounded
and
rolled
beyond
the
circle
of
the
scaffolding
and
they
will
still
tell
you
at
bourg
that
hyvert
s
head
spoke
before
i
had
finished
reading
i
had
decided
to
abandon
rené
d
argonne
for
the
companions
of
jehu
on
the
morrow
i
came
down
with
my
travelling
bag
under
my
arm
you
are
leaving
said
alexandre
to
me
where
are
you
going
to
bourg
in
what
are
you
going
to
do
there
study
the
neighborhood
and
consult
with
the
inhabitants
who
saw
leprêtre
amiet
guyon
and
hyvert
there
are
two
roads
to
bourg
from
paris
of
course
one
may
leave
the
train
at
mâcon
and
take
stage
from
mâcon
to
bourg
or
continuing
as
far
as
lyons
take
train
again
from
lyons
to
bourg
i
was
hesitating
between
these
two
roads
when
one
of
the
travellers
who
was
temporarily
occupying
my
compartment
decided
me
he
was
going
to
bourg
where
he
frequently
had
business
he
was
going
by
way
of
lyons
therefore
lyons
was
the
better
way
i
resolved
to
travel
by
the
same
route
i
slept
at
lyons
and
on
the
morrow
by
ten
in
the
morning
i
was
at
bourg
a
paper
published
in
the
second
capital
of
the
kingdom
met
my
eye
it
contained
a
spiteful
article
about
me
lyons
has
never
forgiven
me
since
i
believe
some
years
ago
for
asserting
that
it
was
not
a
literary
city
alas
i
have
in
the
same
opinion
of
lyons
as
i
had
in
i
do
not
easily
change
my
opinion
there
is
another
city
in
france
that
is
almost
as
bitter
against
me
as
lyons
that
is
rouen
rouen
has
hissed
all
my
plays
including
count
hermann
one
day
a
neapolitan
boasted
to
me
that
he
had
hissed
rossini
and
malibran
the
barbiere
and
that
must
be
true
i
answered
him
for
rossini
and
malibran
on
their
side
boast
of
having
been
hissed
by
so
i
boast
that
the
rouenese
have
hissed
me
nevertheless
meeting
a
rouenese
one
day
i
resolved
to
discover
why
i
had
been
hissed
at
rouen
i
like
to
understand
these
little
things
my
rouenese
informed
me
we
hiss
you
because
we
are
down
on
why
not
rouen
was
down
on
joan
of
arc
nevertheless
it
could
not
be
for
the
same
reason
i
asked
my
rouenese
why
he
and
his
compatriots
were
to
me
i
had
never
said
anything
evil
of
apple
sugar
i
had
treated
barbet
with
respect
during
his
entire
term
as
mayor
and
when
a
delegate
from
the
society
of
letters
at
the
unveiling
of
the
statue
of
the
great
corneille
i
was
the
only
one
who
thought
to
bow
to
him
before
beginning
my
speech
there
was
nothing
in
that
which
could
have
reasonably
incurred
the
hatred
of
the
rouenese
therefore
to
this
haughty
reply
we
hiss
you
because
we
have
a
grudge
against
you
i
asked
humbly
but
great
heavens
why
are
you
down
on
me
oh
you
know
very
well
replied
my
rouenese
i
i
exclaimed
yes
well
never
mind
pretend
i
do
not
you
remember
the
dinner
the
city
gave
you
in
connection
with
that
statue
of
corneille
perfectly
were
they
annoyed
because
i
did
not
return
it
no
it
is
not
what
is
it
then
well
at
that
dinner
they
said
to
you
m
dumas
you
ought
to
write
a
play
for
rouen
based
upon
some
subject
taken
from
its
own
to
which
i
replied
nothing
easier
i
will
come
at
your
first
summons
and
spend
a
fortnight
in
rouen
you
can
suggest
the
subject
and
during
that
fortnight
i
will
write
the
play
the
royalties
of
which
i
shall
devote
to
the
that
is
true
you
said
i
see
nothing
sufficiently
insulting
in
that
to
incur
the
hatred
of
the
yes
but
they
added
will
you
write
it
in
prose
to
which
you
replied
do
you
remember
what
you
answered
my
faith
you
replied
i
will
write
it
in
verse
it
is
soonest
that
sounds
like
me
well
what
then
then
that
was
an
insult
to
corneille
dumas
that
is
why
the
rouenese
are
down
on
you
and
will
be
for
a
long
verbatim
oh
worthy
rouenese
i
trust
that
you
will
never
serve
me
so
ill
as
to
forgive
and
applaud
me
the
aforesaid
paper
observed
that
dumas
had
doubtless
spent
but
one
night
in
lyons
because
a
city
of
such
slight
literary
standing
was
not
worthy
of
his
longer
sojourn
dumas
had
not
thought
about
this
at
all
he
had
spent
but
one
night
at
lyons
because
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
reach
bourg
and
no
sooner
had
dumas
arrived
at
bourg
than
he
asked
to
be
directed
to
the
office
of
its
leading
newspaper
i
knew
that
it
was
under
the
management
of
a
distinguished
archeologist
who
was
also
the
editor
of
my
friend
baux
s
work
on
the
church
of
brou
i
asked
for
milliet
milliet
appeared
we
shook
hands
and
i
explained
the
object
of
my
visit
i
can
fix
you
perfectly
said
he
to
me
i
will
take
you
to
one
of
our
magistrates
who
is
at
present
engaged
upon
a
history
of
the
how
far
has
he
got
in
this
history
then
that
s
all
right
as
the
events
i
want
to
relate
occurred
in
and
my
heroes
were
executed
in
he
will
have
covered
that
epoch
and
can
furnish
me
with
the
desired
information
let
us
go
to
your
on
the
road
milliet
told
me
that
this
same
magisterial
historian
was
also
a
noted
gourmet
since
it
has
been
the
fashion
for
magistrates
to
be
epicures
unfortunately
many
are
content
to
be
gourmands
which
is
not
at
all
the
same
thing
we
were
ushered
into
the
magistrate
s
study
i
found
a
man
with
a
shiny
face
and
a
sneering
smile
he
greeted
me
with
that
protecting
air
which
historians
deign
to
assume
toward
poets
well
sir
he
said
to
me
so
you
have
come
to
our
poor
country
in
search
of
material
for
your
novel
no
sir
i
have
my
material
already
i
have
come
simply
to
consult
your
historical
good
i
did
not
know
that
it
was
necessary
to
give
one
s
self
so
much
trouble
in
order
to
write
there
you
are
in
error
sir
at
least
in
my
instance
i
am
in
the
habit
of
making
exhaustive
researches
upon
all
the
historical
events
of
which
i
you
might
at
least
have
sent
some
one
any
person
whom
i
might
send
sir
not
being
so
completely
absorbed
in
my
subject
might
have
overlooked
many
important
facts
then
too
i
make
use
of
many
localities
which
i
can
not
describe
unless
i
see
oh
then
this
is
a
novel
which
you
intend
writing
yourself
yes
certainly
sir
i
allowed
my
valet
to
write
my
last
but
he
had
such
immense
success
that
the
rogue
asked
so
exorbitant
an
increase
of
wages
that
to
my
great
regret
i
was
unable
to
keep
the
magistrate
bit
his
lips
then
after
a
moment
s
silence
he
said
will
you
kindly
tell
me
sir
how
i
can
assist
you
in
this
important
work
you
can
direct
my
researches
sir
as
you
have
compiled
the
history
of
the
department
none
of
the
important
event
which
have
occurred
in
its
capital
can
be
unknown
to
truly
sir
i
believe
that
in
this
respect
i
am
tolerably
well
then
sir
in
the
first
place
your
department
was
the
centre
of
the
operations
of
the
company
of
sir
i
have
heard
speak
of
the
companions
of
jesus
replied
the
magistrate
with
his
jeering
smile
the
jesuits
you
mean
that
is
not
what
i
am
seeking
nor
is
it
of
them
that
i
am
speaking
i
refer
to
the
stage
robbers
who
infested
the
highroads
from
to
then
sir
permit
me
to
tell
you
they
are
precisely
the
ones
i
have
come
to
bourg
about
and
that
they
were
called
the
companions
of
jehu
and
not
the
companions
of
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
title
companions
of
jehu
i
like
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
so
do
i
sir
that
is
why
i
did
not
wish
to
confound
these
highwaymen
with
the
truly
that
would
not
have
been
very
but
it
is
what
you
would
have
done
nevertheless
sir
if
i
a
poet
had
not
come
here
expressly
to
correct
the
mistake
you
as
historian
have
i
await
your
explanation
sir
resumed
the
magistrate
pursing
his
lips
it
is
short
and
simple
elisha
consecrated
jehu
king
of
israel
on
condition
that
he
exterminate
the
house
of
ahab
elisha
was
louis
xviii
jehu
was
cadoudal
the
house
of
ahab
the
revolution
that
is
why
these
pillagers
of
diligences
who
filched
the
government
money
to
support
the
war
in
the
vendée
were
called
the
companions
of
sir
i
am
happy
to
learn
something
at
my
oh
sir
one
can
always
learn
at
all
times
and
at
all
ages
during
life
one
learns
man
in
death
one
learns
but
after
all
my
interlocutor
said
to
me
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
may
i
know
in
what
i
can
assist
you
thus
sir
four
of
these
young
men
leaders
of
the
companions
of
jehu
were
executed
at
bourg
on
the
place
du
in
the
first
place
sir
in
bourg
executions
do
not
take
place
at
the
bastion
they
execute
on
the
fair
now
sir
these
last
fifteen
or
twenty
years
it
is
true
since
peytel
but
before
especially
during
the
revolution
they
executed
on
the
place
du
that
is
it
is
so
these
four
young
men
were
called
guyon
leprêtre
amiet
and
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
heard
those
yet
their
names
made
a
certain
noise
at
are
you
sure
sir
that
these
men
were
executed
here
i
am
from
whom
have
you
derived
your
information
from
a
man
whose
uncle
then
in
command
of
the
gendarmerie
was
present
at
the
will
you
tell
me
this
man
s
name
charles
charles
nodier
the
novelist
the
poet
if
he
were
a
historian
i
would
not
be
so
insistent
sir
recently
during
a
trip
to
varennes
i
learned
what
dependence
to
place
upon
historians
but
precisely
because
he
is
a
poet
a
novelist
i
do
you
are
at
liberty
to
do
so
but
i
know
nothing
of
what
you
desire
to
learn
and
i
dare
even
assert
that
if
you
have
come
to
bourg
solely
to
obtain
information
concerning
the
execution
of
what
did
you
call
them
guyon
leprêtre
amiet
and
you
have
undertaken
a
futile
voyage
for
these
last
twenty
years
sir
i
have
been
searching
the
town
archives
and
i
have
never
seen
anything
relating
to
what
you
have
just
told
the
town
archives
are
not
those
of
the
registrar
sir
perhaps
at
the
record
office
i
may
be
able
to
find
what
i
am
ah
sir
if
you
can
find
anything
among
those
archives
you
will
be
a
very
clever
man
the
record
office
is
a
chaos
a
veritable
chaos
you
would
have
to
spend
a
month
here
and
then
then
i
do
not
expect
to
stay
here
more
than
a
day
sir
but
if
in
that
day
i
should
find
what
i
am
seeking
will
you
permit
me
to
impart
it
to
you
yes
sir
yes
sir
and
you
will
render
me
a
great
service
by
doing
no
greater
than
the
one
i
asked
of
you
i
shall
merely
give
you
some
information
about
a
matter
of
which
you
were
ignorant
that
is
you
can
well
understand
that
on
leaving
my
magistrate
my
honor
was
piqued
i
determined
cost
what
it
might
to
procure
this
information
about
the
companions
of
jehu
i
went
back
to
milliet
and
cornered
him
listen
he
said
my
is
a
he
s
my
man
let
s
go
find
the
he
s
in
court
at
this
then
let
us
go
to
your
appearance
will
create
a
sensation
i
warn
then
go
alone
tell
him
what
we
want
and
let
him
make
a
search
i
will
visit
the
environs
of
the
town
to
base
my
work
on
the
localities
we
will
meet
at
four
o
clock
at
the
place
du
bastion
if
you
are
it
seems
to
me
that
i
saw
a
forest
coming
the
forest
of
bravo
do
you
need
a
forest
it
is
absolutely
indispensable
to
then
permit
me
what
i
am
going
to
take
you
to
a
friend
of
mine
leduc
a
poet
who
in
his
spare
moments
is
an
inspector
of
what
of
the
are
there
any
ruins
in
the
forest
the
chartreuse
which
is
not
in
the
forest
but
merely
some
hundred
feet
from
and
in
the
forest
there
is
a
sort
of
hermitage
which
is
called
la
correrie
belonging
to
the
chartreuse
with
which
it
communicates
by
a
subterranean
good
now
if
you
can
provide
me
with
a
grotto
you
will
overwhelm
we
have
the
grotto
of
ceyzeriat
but
that
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
i
don
t
mind
if
the
grotto
won
t
come
to
me
i
will
do
like
mahomet
i
will
go
to
the
grotto
in
the
meantime
let
us
go
to
five
minutes
later
we
reached
leduc
s
house
he
on
learning
what
we
wanted
placed
himself
his
horse
and
his
carriage
at
my
disposal
i
accepted
all
there
are
some
men
who
offer
their
services
in
such
a
way
that
they
place
you
at
once
at
your
ease
we
first
visited
the
chartreuse
had
i
built
it
myself
it
could
not
have
suited
me
better
a
deserted
cloister
devastated
garden
inhabitants
almost
savages
chance
i
thank
thee
from
there
we
went
to
the
correrie
it
was
the
supplement
of
the
chartreuse
i
did
not
yet
know
what
i
could
do
with
it
but
evidently
it
might
be
useful
to
me
now
sir
i
said
to
my
obliging
guide
i
need
a
pretty
site
rather
gloomy
surrounded
by
tall
trees
beside
a
river
have
you
anything
like
that
in
the
neighborhood
what
do
you
want
to
do
with
it
to
build
a
château
what
kind
of
a
château
zounds
of
cards
i
have
a
family
to
house
a
model
mother
a
melancholy
young
girl
a
mischievous
brother
and
a
poaching
there
is
a
place
called
in
the
first
place
the
name
is
but
there
is
no
château
so
much
the
better
for
i
should
have
been
obliged
to
demolish
let
us
go
to
we
started
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
we
descended
at
the
ranger
s
lodge
shall
we
take
this
little
path
said
leduc
it
will
take
us
where
you
want
to
it
led
us
in
fact
to
a
spot
planted
with
tall
trees
which
overshadowed
three
or
four
rivulets
we
call
this
place
leduc
explained
and
here
madame
de
montrevel
amélie
and
little
edouard
will
dwell
now
what
are
those
villages
which
i
see
in
front
of
me
here
close
at
hand
is
montagnac
yonder
on
the
mountain
side
is
that
where
the
grotto
is
yes
but
how
did
you
know
there
was
a
grotto
at
ceyzeriat
never
mind
go
on
the
name
of
those
other
villages
if
you
tréconnas
ramasse
that
will
have
you
enough
i
drew
out
my
sketched
a
plan
of
the
locality
and
wrote
about
in
their
relative
positions
the
names
of
the
villages
which
leduc
had
just
pointed
out
to
me
that
s
done
said
i
where
shall
we
go
now
isn
t
the
church
of
brou
near
this
road
then
let
us
go
to
the
church
of
do
you
need
that
in
your
novel
yes
indeed
you
don
t
imagine
i
am
going
to
lay
my
scene
in
a
country
which
contains
the
architectural
masterpiece
of
the
sixteenth
century
without
utilizing
that
masterpiece
do
you
let
us
go
to
the
church
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
sacristan
showed
us
into
this
granite
which
contains
the
three
marble
gems
called
the
tombs
of
marguerite
of
austria
marguerite
or
bourbon
and
of
philibert
le
beau
how
is
it
i
asked
the
sacristan
that
all
these
masterpieces
were
not
reduced
to
powder
during
the
revolution
ah
sir
the
municipality
had
an
what
was
it
that
of
turning
the
church
into
a
storage
house
for
yes
and
the
hay
saved
the
marble
you
are
right
my
friend
that
an
does
this
idea
of
the
municipality
afford
you
another
asked
leduc
faith
yes
and
i
shall
have
poor
luck
if
i
don
t
make
something
out
of
i
looked
at
my
watch
three
o
clock
now
for
the
prison
i
have
an
appointment
with
milliet
at
four
on
the
place
du
wait
there
is
one
thing
what
is
that
have
you
noticed
marguerite
of
austria
s
motto
no
where
is
it
oh
all
over
in
the
first
place
look
above
her
fortune
infortune
fort
well
what
does
this
play
of
words
mean
learned
men
translate
it
thus
fate
persecutes
a
woman
explain
that
a
you
must
in
the
first
place
assume
that
it
is
derived
from
the
true
that
is
well
then
fortuna
infortunat
oh
oh
bless
me
that
strongly
resembles
a
solecism
what
do
you
want
an
explain
it
well
fortuna
infortuna
forti
fortune
and
misfortune
are
alike
to
the
do
you
know
that
may
possibly
be
the
correct
translation
zounds
see
what
it
is
not
to
be
learned
my
dear
sir
we
are
endowed
with
and
that
sees
clearer
than
science
have
you
anything
else
to
tell
me
then
let
us
go
to
the
we
got
into
the
carriage
and
returned
to
the
city
stopping
only
at
the
gate
of
the
prison
i
glanced
out
of
the
window
oh
i
exclaimed
they
have
spoiled
it
for
what
they
ve
spoiled
it
for
you
certainly
it
was
not
like
this
in
my
prisoners
time
can
i
speak
to
the
jailer
then
let
us
consult
we
knocked
at
the
door
a
man
about
forty
opened
it
he
recognized
leduc
my
dear
fellow
leduc
said
to
him
this
is
one
of
my
learned
friends
come
come
i
exclaimed
interrupting
him
no
who
contends
continued
leduc
that
the
prison
is
no
longer
the
same
as
it
was
in
the
last
century
that
is
true
leduc
it
was
torn
down
and
rebuilt
in
then
the
interior
arrangements
are
no
longer
the
same
oh
no
sir
everything
was
could
i
see
the
old
plan
m
martin
the
architect
might
perhaps
be
able
to
find
one
for
is
he
any
relation
to
martin
the
lawyer
his
very
well
my
friend
then
i
can
get
my
then
we
have
nothing
more
to
do
here
inquired
leduc
then
i
am
free
to
go
home
i
shall
be
sorry
to
leave
you
that
is
can
you
find
your
way
to
the
bastion
without
me
it
is
close
what
are
you
going
to
do
this
evening
i
will
spend
it
with
you
if
you
very
good
you
will
find
a
cup
of
tea
waiting
for
you
at
i
shall
be
on
hand
for
i
thanked
leduc
we
shook
hands
and
parted
i
went
down
the
rue
des
lisses
meaning
lists
from
a
combat
which
took
place
in
the
square
to
which
it
leads
and
skirting
the
montburon
garden
i
reached
the
place
du
bastion
this
is
a
semicircle
now
used
as
the
town
marketplace
in
the
midst
stands
the
statue
of
bichat
by
david
d
angers
bichat
in
a
frockcoat
why
that
exaggeration
of
realism
stands
with
his
hand
upon
the
heart
of
a
child
about
nine
or
ten
years
old
perfectly
nude
why
that
excess
of
ideality
extended
at
bichat
s
feet
lies
a
dead
body
it
is
bichat
s
book
of
life
and
of
death
translated
into
bronze
i
was
studying
this
statue
which
epitomizes
the
defects
and
merits
of
david
d
angers
when
i
felt
some
one
touch
my
shoulder
i
turned
around
it
was
milliet
he
held
a
paper
in
his
hand
well
i
asked
well
victory
what
is
that
you
have
there
the
minutes
of
the
trial
and
of
whom
of
your
of
guyon
leprêtre
amiet
and
give
it
to
here
it
i
took
it
and
read

of
the
death
and
execution
of
laurent

ix
the

of
the
year
the
government
commissioner
of
the
tribunal
who
received
at
eleven
of
the
evening
the
budget
of
the
minister
of
justice
containing
the
minutes
of
the
trial
and
the
judgment
which
condemns
to
death
laurent
guyon
etienne
hyvert
françois
amiet
and
antoine
leprêtre
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
sixth
rejecting
the
appeal
against
the
sentence
of
the
thermidor
of
the
year
i
did
notify
by
letter
between
seven
and
eight
of
the
morning
the
four
accused
that
their
sentence
of
death
would
take
effect
at
eleven
o
clock
in
the
interval
which
elapsed
before
eleven
o
clock
the
four
accused
shot
themselves
with
pistols
and
stabbed
themselves
with
blows
from
a
poinard
in
prison
leprêtre
and
guyon
according
to
public
rumor
were
dead
hyvert
fatally
wounded
and
dying
amiet
fatally
wounded
but
still
conscious
all
four
in
this
state
were
conveyed
to
the
scaffold
and
living
or
dead
were
guillotined
at
half
after
eleven
the
sheriff
colin
handed
in
the
report
of
their
execution
to
the
municipality
for
registration
upon
the
death
roll
the
captain
of
gendarmerie
remitted
to
the
justice
of
the
peace
a
report
of
what
had
occurred
in
the
prison
of
which
he
was
a
witness
i
who
was
not
present
do
certify
to
what
i
have
learned
by
hearsay
only
signed
dubost
bourg
vendemiaire
of
the
year
ix
ah
so
it
was
the
poet
who
was
right
and
not
the
historian
the
captain
of
gendarmerie
who
remitted
the
report
of
the
proceedings
in
the
prison
to
the
justice
of
the
peace
at
which
he
was
present
was
nodier
s
uncle
this
report
handed
to
the
justice
of
the
peace
was
the
story
which
graven
upon
the
young
man
s
mind
saw
the
light
some
forty
years
later
unaltered
in
that
masterpiece
entitled
souvenirs
de
la
the
entire
series
of
papers
was
in
the
record
office
martin
offered
to
have
them
copied
for
me
inquiry
trial
and
judgment
i
had
a
copy
of
nodier
s
souvenirs
of
the
revolution
in
my
pocket
in
my
hand
i
held
the
report
of
the
execution
which
confirmed
the
facts
therein
stated
now
let
us
go
to
our
magistrate
i
said
to
milliet
let
us
go
to
our
magistrate
he
repeated
the
magistrate
was
confounded
and
i
left
him
convinced
that
poets
know
history
as
well
as
historians
if
not
better
alex
dumas
prologue
the
city
of
avignon
we
do
not
know
if
the
prologue
we
are
going
to
present
to
our
readers
eyes
be
very
useful
nevertheless
we
can
not
resist
the
desire
to
make
of
it
not
the
first
chapter
but
the
preface
of
this
book
the
more
we
advance
in
life
the
more
we
advance
in
art
the
more
convinced
we
become
that
nothing
is
abrupt
and
isolated
that
nature
and
society
progress
by
evolution
and
not
by
chance
and
that
the
event
flower
joyous
or
sad
perfumed
or
fetid
beneficent
or
fatal
which
unfolds
itself
before
our
eyes
was
sown
in
the
past
and
had
its
roots
sometimes
in
days
anterior
to
ours
even
as
it
will
bear
its
fruits
in
the
future
young
man
accepts
life
as
it
comes
enamored
of
yestereen
careless
of
the
day
heeding
little
the
morrow
youth
is
the
springtide
with
its
dewy
dawns
and
its
beautiful
nights
if
sometimes
a
storm
clouds
the
sky
it
gathers
mutters
and
disperses
leaving
the
sky
bluer
the
atmosphere
purer
and
nature
more
smiling
than
before
what
use
is
there
in
reflecting
on
this
storm
that
passes
swift
as
a
caprice
ephemeral
as
a
fancy
before
we
have
discovered
the
secret
of
the
meteorological
enigma
the
storm
will
have
disappeared
but
it
is
not
thus
with
the
terrible
phenomena
which
at
the
close
of
summer
threaten
our
harvests
or
in
the
midst
of
autumn
assail
our
vintages
we
ask
whither
they
go
we
query
whence
they
come
we
seek
a
means
to
prevent
them
to
the
thinker
the
historian
the
poet
there
is
a
far
deeper
subject
for
reflection
in
revolutions
these
tempests
of
the
social
atmosphere
which
drench
the
earth
with
blood
and
crush
an
entire
generation
of
men
than
in
those
upheavals
of
nature
which
deluge
a
harvest
or
flay
the
vineyards
with
hail
that
is
to
say
the
fruits
of
a
single
harvest
wreaking
an
injury
which
can
at
the
worst
be
repaired
the
ensuing
year
unless
the
lord
be
in
his
days
of
wrath
thus
in
other
days
be
it
forgetfulness
heedlessness
or
ignorance
perhaps
blessed
he
who
is
ignorant
a
fool
he
who
is
wise
in
other
days
in
relating
the
story
which
i
am
going
to
tell
you
i
would
without
pausing
at
the
place
where
the
first
scene
of
this
book
occurs
have
accorded
it
but
a
superficial
mention
and
traversing
the
midi
like
any
other
province
have
named
avignon
like
any
other
city
but
it
is
no
longer
the
same
i
am
no
longer
tossed
by
the
flurries
of
spring
but
by
the
storms
of
summer
the
tempests
of
autumn
when
i
name
avignon
i
evoke
a
spectre
and
like
antony
displaying
cæsar
s
toga
say
look
in
this
place
ran
cassius
dagger
through
see
what
a
rent
the
envious
casca
made
through
this
the
brutus
stabbed
so
seeing
the
bloody
shroud
of
the
papal
city
i
say
behold
the
blood
of
the
albigenses
and
here
the
blood
of
the
cevennais
behold
the
blood
of
the
republicans
and
here
the
blood
of
the
royalists
behold
the
blood
of
lescuyer
behold
the
blood
of
maréchal
and
i
feel
myself
seized
with
a
profound
sadness
and
i
begin
to
write
but
at
the
first
lines
i
perceive
that
without
suspecting
it
the
historian
s
chisel
has
superseded
the
novelist
s
pen
in
my
hand
well
let
us
be
both
reader
grant
me
these
ten
fifteen
twenty
pages
to
the
historian
the
novelist
shall
have
the
rest
let
us
say
therefore
a
few
words
about
avignon
the
place
where
the
first
scene
of
the
new
book
which
we
are
offering
to
the
public
opens
perhaps
before
reading
what
we
have
to
say
it
would
be
well
to
cast
a
glance
at
what
its
native
historian
françois
nouguier
says
of
it
avignon
he
writes
a
town
noble
for
its
antiquity
pleasing
in
its
site
superb
for
its
walls
smiling
for
the
fertility
of
its
soil
charming
for
the
gentleness
of
its
inhabitants
magnificent
for
its
palace
beautiful
in
its
broad
streets
marvellous
in
the
construction
of
its
bridge
rich
because
of
its
commerce
and
known
to
all
the
may
the
shade
of
françois
nouguier
pardon
us
if
we
do
not
at
first
see
his
city
with
the
same
eyes
as
he
does
to
those
who
know
avignon
be
it
to
say
who
has
best
described
it
the
historian
or
the
novelist
it
is
but
just
to
assert
in
the
first
place
that
avignon
is
a
town
by
itself
that
is
to
say
a
town
of
extreme
passions
the
period
of
religious
dissensions
which
culminated
for
her
in
political
hatreds
dates
from
the
twelfth
century
after
his
flight
from
lyons
the
valleys
of
mont
ventoux
sheltered
pierre
de
valdo
and
his
vaudois
the
ancestors
of
those
protestants
who
under
the
name
of
the
albigenses
cost
the
counts
of
toulouse
and
transferred
to
the
papacy
the
seven
châteaux
which
raymond
vi
possessed
in
languedoc
avignon
a
powerful
republic
governed
by
podestats
refused
to
submit
to
the
king
of
france
one
morning
louis
who
thought
it
easier
to
make
a
crusade
against
avignon
like
simon
de
montfort
than
against
jerusalem
like
philippe
auguste
one
morning
we
say
louis
viii
appeared
before
the
gates
of
avignon
demanding
admission
with
lances
at
rest
visor
down
banners
unfurled
and
trumpets
of
war
sounding
the
bourgeois
refused
they
offered
the
king
of
france
as
a
last
concession
a
peaceful
entrance
lances
erect
and
the
royal
banner
alone
unfurled
the
king
laid
siege
to
the
town
a
siege
which
lasted
three
months
during
which
says
the
chronicler
the
bourgeois
of
avignon
returned
the
french
soldiers
arrow
for
arrow
wound
for
wound
death
for
death
the
city
capitulated
at
length
louis
viii
brought
the
roman
in
his
train
it
was
he
who
dictated
the
terms
veritable
priestly
terms
hard
and
unconditional
the
avignonese
were
commanded
to
demolish
their
ramparts
to
fill
their
moats
to
raze
three
hundred
towers
to
sell
their
vessels
and
to
burn
their
engines
and
machines
of
war
they
had
moreover
to
pay
an
enormous
impost
to
abjure
the
vaudois
heresy
and
maintain
thirty
men
fully
armed
and
equipped
in
palestine
to
aid
in
delivering
the
tomb
of
christ
and
finally
to
watch
over
the
fulfillment
of
these
terms
of
which
the
bull
is
still
extant
in
the
city
archives
a
brotherhood
of
penitents
was
founded
which
reaching
down
through
six
centuries
still
exists
in
our
days
in
opposition
to
these
penitents
known
as
the
white
penitents
the
order
of
the
black
penitents
was
founded
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
opposition
of
raymond
of
toulouse
from
that
day
forth
the
religious
hatreds
developed
into
political
hatreds
it
was
not
sufficient
that
avignon
should
be
the
land
of
heresy
she
was
destined
to
become
the
theatre
of
schisms
permit
us
in
connection
with
this
french
rome
a
short
historical
digression
strictly
speaking
it
is
not
essential
to
the
subject
of
which
we
treat
and
we
were
perhaps
wiser
to
launch
ourselves
immediately
into
the
heart
of
the
drama
but
we
trust
that
we
will
be
forgiven
we
write
more
particularly
for
those
who
in
a
novel
like
occasionally
to
meet
with
something
more
than
fiction
in
philippe
le
bel
ascended
the
throne
it
is
a
great
historical
date
this
date
of
the
papacy
which
in
the
person
of
gregory
successfully
opposed
the
emperor
of
germany
the
papacy
which
vanquished
in
matters
temporal
by
henry
yet
vanquished
him
morally
this
papacy
was
slapped
by
a
simple
sabine
gentleman
and
the
steel
gauntlet
of
colonna
reddened
the
cheek
of
boniface
viii
but
the
king
of
france
whose
hand
had
really
dealt
this
blow
what
happened
to
him
under
the
successor
of
boniface
this
successor
was
benedict
a
man
of
low
origin
but
who
might
perhaps
have
developed
into
a
man
of
genius
had
they
allowed
him
the
time
too
weak
for
an
open
struggle
with
philippe
le
bel
he
found
a
means
which
would
have
been
the
envy
of
the
founder
of
a
celebrated
order
two
hundred
years
later
he
pardoned
colonna
openly
to
pardon
colonna
was
to
declare
colonna
culpable
since
culprits
alone
have
need
of
pardon
if
colonna
were
guilty
the
king
of
france
was
at
least
his
accomplice
there
was
some
danger
in
supporting
such
an
argument
also
benedict
xi
was
pope
but
eight
months
one
day
a
veiled
woman
a
pretended
of
at
perugia
came
to
him
while
he
was
at
table
offering
him
a
basket
of
figs
did
it
conceal
an
asp
like
cleopatra
s
the
fact
is
that
on
the
morrow
the
holy
see
was
vacant
then
philippe
le
bel
had
a
strange
idea
so
strange
that
it
must
at
first
have
seemed
an
hallucination
it
was
to
withdraw
the
papacy
from
rome
to
install
it
in
france
to
put
it
in
jail
and
force
it
to
coin
money
for
his
profit
the
reign
of
philippe
le
bel
was
the
advent
of
gold
gold
that
was
the
sole
and
unique
god
of
this
king
who
had
slapped
a
pope
saint
louis
had
a
priest
the
worthy
abbé
suger
for
minister
philippe
le
bel
had
two
bankers
two
florentines
biscio
and
musiato
do
you
expect
dear
reader
that
we
are
about
to
fall
into
the
philosophical
commonplace
of
anathematizing
gold
you
are
mistaken
in
the
thirteenth
century
gold
meant
progress
until
then
nothing
was
known
but
the
soil
gold
was
the
soil
converted
into
money
the
soil
mobilized
exchangeable
transportable
divisible
subtilized
spiritualized
as
it
were
so
long
as
the
soil
was
not
represented
by
gold
man
like
the
god
thermes
that
landmark
of
the
fields
had
his
feet
imprisoned
by
the
earth
formerly
the
earth
bore
man
man
bears
the
earth
but
this
gold
had
to
be
abstracted
from
its
and
it
was
hidden
far
otherwise
than
in
the
mines
of
chile
or
mexico
all
the
gold
was
in
the
possession
of
the
churches
and
the
jews
to
extract
it
from
this
double
mine
it
needed
more
than
a
king
it
required
a
pope
and
that
is
why
philippe
le
bel
that
great
exploiter
of
gold
resolved
to
have
a
pope
of
his
own
benedict
xi
dead
a
conclave
was
held
at
perugia
at
this
conclave
the
french
cardinals
were
in
the
majority
philippe
le
bel
cast
his
eyes
upon
the
archbishop
of
bordeaux
bertrand
de
got
and
to
him
he
gave
rendezvous
in
a
forest
near
d
angely
bertrand
de
got
took
heed
not
to
miss
that
appointment
the
king
and
the
archbishop
heard
mass
there
and
at
the
moment
when
the
host
was
elevated
they
bound
themselves
by
this
god
they
glorified
to
absolute
secrecy
bertrand
de
got
was
still
ignorant
of
the
matter
in
question
mass
over
philippe
le
bel
said
archbishop
i
have
it
in
my
power
to
make
thee
bertrand
de
got
listened
no
longer
but
cast
himself
at
the
king
s
feet
saying
what
must
i
do
to
obtain
this
accord
me
the
six
favors
which
i
shall
ask
of
thee
replied
philippe
le
bel
it
s
for
thee
to
command
and
for
me
to
obey
said
the
future
pope
the
vow
of
servitude
was
taken
the
king
raised
bertrand
de
got
and
kissing
him
on
the
mouth
said
the
six
favors
which
i
demand
of
thee
are
these
first
thou
shalt
reconcile
me
completely
with
the
church
and
grant
me
pardon
for
the
misdeed
that
i
committed
toward
boniface
viii
second
thou
shalt
restore
to
me
and
mine
the
right
of
communion
of
which
the
court
of
rome
deprived
me
third
thou
shalt
grant
me
the
clergy
s
tithe
in
my
kingdom
for
the
next
five
years
to
help
defray
the
expenses
of
the
war
in
flanders
fourth
thou
shalt
destroy
and
annul
the
memory
of
pope
boniface
viii
fifth
thou
shalt
bestow
the
dignity
of
cardinal
upon
messires
jacopo
and
pietro
de
colonna
as
to
the
sixth
favor
and
promise
that
i
shall
reserve
to
speak
to
thee
thereof
in
its
time
and
bertrand
de
got
swore
to
the
promises
and
favors
known
and
to
the
promise
and
favor
unknown
this
last
which
the
king
had
not
dared
to
mention
in
connection
with
the
others
was
the
abolition
of
the
knights
templar
besides
the
promises
made
on
the
corpus
domini
bertrand
de
got
gave
as
hostages
his
brother
and
two
of
his
nephews
the
king
swore
on
his
side
that
he
should
be
elected
pope
this
scene
set
in
the
deep
shadows
of
a
crossroad
in
the
forest
resembled
rather
an
evocation
between
magician
and
demon
than
an
agreement
entered
upon
between
king
and
pope
also
the
coronation
of
the
king
which
took
place
shortly
afterward
at
lyons
and
which
began
the
church
s
captivity
seemed
but
little
agreeable
to
god
just
as
the
royal
procession
was
passing
a
wall
crowded
with
spectators
fell
wounding
the
king
and
killing
the
duc
de
bretagne
the
pope
was
thrown
to
the
ground
and
his
tiara
rolled
in
the
mud
bertrand
de
got
was
elected
pope
under
the
name
of
clement
clement
paid
all
that
bertrand
de
got
had
promised
philippe
was
absolved
holy
communion
restored
to
him
and
his
the
purple
again
descended
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
colonna
the
church
was
obliged
to
defray
the
expenses
of
the
war
in
flanders
and
philippe
de
valois
s
crusade
against
the
greek
empire
the
memory
of
pope
boniface
viii
was
if
not
destroyed
and
annulled
at
least
besmirched
the
walls
of
the
temple
were
razed
and
the
templars
burned
on
the
open
space
of
the
pont
neuf
all
these
edicts
they
were
no
longer
called
bulls
from
the
moment
the
temporal
power
dictated
them
all
these
edicts
were
dated
at
avignon
philippe
le
bel
was
the
richest
of
all
the
kings
of
the
french
monarchy
he
possessed
an
inexhaustible
treasury
that
is
to
say
his
pope
he
had
purchased
him
he
used
him
he
put
him
to
the
press
and
as
cider
flows
from
apples
so
did
this
crushed
pope
bleed
gold
the
pontificate
struck
by
the
colonna
in
the
person
of
boniface
abdicated
the
empire
of
the
world
in
the
person
of
clement
we
have
related
the
advent
of
the
king
of
blood
and
the
pope
of
gold
we
know
how
they
ended
jacques
de
molay
from
his
funeral
pyre
adjured
them
both
to
appear
before
god
within
the
year
to
geron
says
aristophanes
dying
hoary
heads
possess
the
souls
of
clement
departed
first
in
a
vision
he
saw
his
palace
in
flames
from
that
moment
says
baluze
he
became
sad
and
lasted
but
a
short
seven
months
later
it
was
philippe
s
turn
some
say
that
he
was
killed
while
hunting
overthrown
by
a
wild
boar
dante
is
among
their
number
he
said
he
who
was
seen
near
the
seine
falsifying
the
coin
of
the
realm
shall
die
by
the
tusk
of
a
but
guillaume
de
nangis
makes
the
royal
counterfeiter
die
of
a
death
quite
otherwise
providential
undermined
by
a
malady
unknown
to
the
physicians
philippe
expired
said
he
to
the
great
astonishment
of
everybody
without
either
his
pulse
or
his
urine
revealing
the
cause
of
his
malady
or
the
imminence
of
the
the
king
of
debauchery
the
king
of
uproar
louis
called
the
hutin
succeeded
his
father
philippe
le
bel
john
xxii
to
clement
avignon
then
became
in
truth
a
second
rome
john
xxii
and
clement
vi
anointed
her
queen
of
luxury
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
times
made
her
queen
of
debauchery
and
indulgence
in
place
of
her
towers
razed
by
romain
de
hernandez
de
héredi
grand
master
of
of
jerusalem
girdled
her
with
a
belt
of
walls
she
possessed
dissolute
monks
who
transformed
the
blessed
precincts
of
her
convents
into
places
of
debauchery
and
licentiousness
her
beautiful
courtesans
tore
the
diamonds
from
the
tiara
to
make
of
them
bracelets
and
necklaces
and
finally
she
possessed
the
echoes
of
vaucluse
which
wafted
the
melodious
strains
of
petrarch
s
songs
to
her
this
lasted
until
king
charles
who
was
a
virtuous
and
pious
prince
having
resolved
to
put
an
end
to
the
scandal
sent
the
maréchal
de
boucicaut
to
drive
out
the
benedict
from
avignon
but
at
sight
of
the
soldiers
of
the
king
of
france
the
latter
remembered
that
before
being
pope
under
the
name
of
benedict
xiii
he
had
been
captain
under
the
name
of
pierre
de
luna
for
five
months
he
defended
himself
pointing
his
engines
of
war
with
his
own
hands
from
the
heights
of
the
château
walls
engines
otherwise
far
more
murderous
than
his
pontifical
bolts
at
last
forced
to
flee
he
left
the
city
by
a
postern
after
having
ruined
a
hundred
houses
and
killed
four
thousand
avignonese
and
fled
to
spain
where
the
king
of
aragon
offered
him
sanctuary
there
each
morning
from
the
summit
of
a
tower
assisted
by
the
two
priests
who
constituted
his
sacred
college
he
blessed
the
whole
world
which
was
none
the
better
for
it
and
excommunicated
his
enemies
who
were
none
the
worse
for
it
at
last
feeling
himself
nigh
to
death
and
fearing
lest
the
schism
die
with
him
he
elected
his
two
vicars
cardinals
on
the
condition
that
after
his
death
one
of
the
two
would
elect
the
other
pope
the
election
was
made
the
new
pope
supported
by
the
cardinal
who
made
him
continued
the
schism
for
awhile
finally
both
entered
into
negotiations
with
rome
made
honorable
amends
and
returned
to
the
fold
of
holy
church
one
with
the
title
of
arch
bishop
of
seville
the
other
as
archbishop
of
toledo
from
this
time
until
avignon
widowed
of
her
popes
was
governed
by
legates
and
seven
sovereign
pontiffs
had
resided
within
her
walls
some
seven
decades
she
had
seven
hospitals
seven
fraternities
of
penitents
seven
monasteries
seven
convents
seven
parishes
and
seven
cemeteries
to
those
who
know
avignon
there
was
at
that
epoch
there
is
yet
two
cities
within
a
city
the
city
of
the
priests
that
is
to
say
the
roman
city
and
the
city
of
the
merchants
that
is
to
say
the
french
city
the
city
of
the
priests
with
its
papal
palace
its
hundred
churches
its
innumerable
ever
ready
to
sound
the
tocsin
of
conflagration
the
knell
of
slaughter
the
town
of
the
merchants
with
its
rhone
its
its
crossroads
extending
north
east
south
and
west
from
lyons
to
marseilles
from
nimes
to
turin
the
french
city
the
accursed
city
longing
for
a
king
jealous
of
its
liberties
shuddering
beneath
its
yoke
of
vassalage
a
vassalage
of
the
priests
with
the
clergy
for
its
lord
the
clergy
not
the
pious
clergy
tolerantly
austere
in
the
practice
of
its
duty
and
charity
living
in
the
world
to
console
and
edify
it
without
mingling
in
its
joys
and
passions
but
a
clergy
such
as
intrigue
cupidity
and
ambition
had
made
it
that
is
to
say
the
court
abbés
rivalling
the
roman
priests
indolent
libertine
elegant
impudent
kings
of
fashion
autocrats
of
the
salon
kissing
the
hands
of
those
ladies
of
whom
they
boasted
themselves
the
paramours
giving
their
hands
to
kiss
to
the
women
of
the
people
whom
they
honored
by
making
their
mistresses
do
you
want
a
type
of
those
abbés
take
the
abbé
maury
proud
as
a
duke
insolent
as
a
lackey
the
son
of
a
shoemaker
more
aristocratic
than
the
son
of
a
great
lord
one
understands
that
these
two
categories
of
inhabitants
representing
the
one
heresy
the
other
orthodoxy
the
one
the
french
party
the
other
the
roman
party
the
one
the
party
of
absolute
monarchy
the
other
that
of
progressive
constitutionalism
were
not
elements
conducive
to
the
peace
and
security
of
this
ancient
pontifical
city
one
understands
we
say
that
at
the
moment
when
the
revolution
broke
out
in
paris
and
manifested
itself
by
the
taking
of
the
bastille
that
the
two
parties
hot
from
the
religious
wars
of
louis
could
not
remain
inert
in
the
presence
of
each
other
we
have
said
avignon
city
of
priests
let
us
add
city
of
hatreds
nowhere
better
than
in
convent
towns
does
one
learn
to
hate
the
heart
of
the
child
everywhere
else
free
from
wicked
passions
was
born
there
full
of
paternal
hatreds
inherited
from
father
to
son
for
the
last
eight
hundred
years
and
after
a
life
of
hate
bequeathed
in
its
turn
a
diabolical
heritage
to
his
children
therefore
at
the
first
cry
of
liberty
which
rang
through
france
the
french
town
rose
full
of
joy
and
hope
the
moment
had
come
at
last
for
her
to
contest
aloud
that
concession
made
by
a
young
queen
a
minor
in
expiation
of
her
sins
of
a
city
and
a
province
and
with
it
half
a
million
souls
by
what
right
had
she
sold
these
souls
in
æternum
to
the
hardest
and
most
exacting
of
all
masters
the
roman
pontiff
all
france
was
hastening
to
assemble
in
the
fraternal
embrace
of
the
federation
at
the
champ
de
mars
was
she
not
france
her
sons
ejected
delegates
to
wait
upon
the
legate
and
request
him
respectfully
to
leave
the
city
giving
him
hours
in
which
to
do
so
during
the
night
the
papists
amused
themselves
by
hanging
from
a
gibbet
an
effigy
of
straw
wearing
the
cockade
the
course
of
the
rhone
has
been
controlled
the
durance
canalled
dikes
have
been
built
to
restrain
the
fierce
torrents
which
at
the
melting
of
the
snows
pour
in
liquid
avalanches
from
the
summits
of
mt
ventoux
but
this
terrible
flood
this
living
flood
this
human
torrent
that
rushed
leaping
through
the
rapid
inclines
of
the
streets
of
avignon
once
released
once
flooding
not
even
god
himself
has
yet
sought
to
stay
it
at
sight
of
this
manikin
with
the
national
colors
dancing
at
the
end
of
a
cord
the
french
city
rose
upon
its
very
foundations
with
terrible
cries
of
rage
four
papist
suspected
of
this
sacrilege
two
marquises
one
burgher
and
a
workman
were
torn
from
their
homes
and
hung
in
the
manikin
s
stead
this
occurred
the
eleventh
of
june
the
whole
french
town
wrote
to
the
national
assembly
that
she
gave
herself
to
france
and
with
her
the
rhone
her
commerce
the
midi
and
the
half
of
provence
the
national
assembly
was
in
one
of
its
reactionary
moods
it
did
not
wish
to
quarrel
with
the
pope
it
dallied
with
the
king
and
the
matter
was
adjourned
from
that
moment
the
rising
became
a
revolt
and
the
pope
was
free
to
do
with
avignon
what
the
court
might
have
done
with
paris
if
the
assembly
had
delayed
its
proclamation
of
the
rights
of
man
the
pope
ordered
the
annulment
of
all
that
had
occurred
at
the
comtat
venaissin
the
of
the
privileges
of
the
nobles
and
clergy
and
the
reinstallation
of
the
inquisition
in
all
its
rigor
the
pontifical
decrees
were
affixed
to
the
walls
one
man
one
only
in
broad
daylight
dared
to
go
straight
to
the
walls
in
face
of
all
and
tear
down
the
decree
his
name
was
lescuyer
he
was
not
a
young
man
and
therefore
it
was
not
the
fire
of
youth
that
impelled
him
no
he
was
almost
an
old
man
who
did
not
even
belong
to
the
province
he
was
a
frenchman
from
picardy
ardent
yet
reflective
a
former
notary
long
since
established
at
avignon
it
was
a
crime
that
roman
avignon
remembered
a
crime
so
great
that
the
virgin
wept
you
see
avignon
is
another
italy
she
must
have
her
miracles
and
if
god
will
not
perform
them
so
surely
will
some
one
be
at
hand
to
invent
them
still
further
the
miracle
must
be
a
miracle
pertaining
to
the
virgin
la
madonna
the
mind
the
heart
the
tongue
of
the
italians
are
full
of
these
two
words
it
was
in
the
church
of
the
cordeliers
that
this
miracle
occurred
the
crowd
rushed
there
it
was
much
that
the
virgin
should
weep
but
a
rumor
spread
at
the
same
time
that
brought
the
excitement
to
a
climax
a
large
coffer
tightly
sealed
had
been
carried
through
the
city
this
chest
had
excited
the
curiosity
of
all
avignon
what
did
it
contain
two
hours
later
it
was
no
longer
a
coffer
but
eighteen
trunks
had
been
seen
going
toward
the
rhone
as
for
their
contents
a
porter
had
revealed
that
they
contained
articles
from
the
that
the
french
party
were
taking
with
them
into
exile
articles
from
the
that
is
to
say
the
spoils
of
the
poor
the
poorer
the
city
the
richer
its
few
could
boast
such
wealth
as
those
of
avignon
it
was
no
longer
a
factional
affair
it
was
a
theft
an
infamous
theft
whites
and
reds
rushed
to
the
church
of
the
cordeliers
shouting
that
the
municipality
must
render
them
an
accounting
lescuyer
was
the
secretary
of
the
municipality
his
name
was
thrown
to
the
crowd
not
for
having
torn
down
the
pontifical
decrees
from
that
moment
he
would
have
had
defenders
but
for
having
signed
the
order
to
the
keeper
of
the
permitting
the
removal
of
the
articles
in
pawn
four
men
were
sent
to
seize
lescuyer
and
bring
him
to
the
church
they
found
him
in
the
street
on
his
way
to
the
municipality
the
four
men
fell
upon
him
and
dragged
him
to
the
church
with
the
most
ferocious
cries
once
there
lescuyer
understood
from
the
flaming
eyes
that
met
his
from
the
clinched
fists
threatening
him
the
shrieks
demanding
his
death
lescuyer
understood
that
instead
of
being
in
the
house
of
the
lord
he
was
in
one
of
those
circles
of
hell
forgotten
by
dante
the
only
idea
that
occurred
to
him
as
to
this
hatred
against
him
was
that
he
had
caused
it
by
tearing
down
the
pontifical
decrees
he
climbed
into
the
pulpit
expecting
to
convert
it
into
a
seat
of
justice
and
in
the
voice
of
a
man
who
not
only
does
not
blame
himself
but
who
is
even
ready
to
repeat
his
action
he
said
brothers
i
consider
the
revolution
necessary
consequently
i
have
done
all
in
my
power
the
fanatics
understood
that
if
lescuyer
explained
lescuyer
was
saved
that
was
not
what
they
wanted
they
flung
themselves
upon
him
tore
him
from
the
pulpit
and
thrust
him
into
the
midst
of
this
howling
mob
who
dragged
him
to
the
altar
with
that
sort
of
terrible
cry
which
combines
the
hiss
of
the
serpent
and
the
roar
of
the
tiger
the
murderous
zou
zou
peculiar
to
the
people
of
avignon
lescuyer
recognized
that
fatal
cry
he
endeavored
to
gain
refuge
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
he
found
none
he
fell
there
a
laborer
armed
with
a
stick
dealt
him
such
a
blow
on
the
head
that
the
stick
broke
in
two
pieces
then
the
people
hurled
themselves
upon
the
poor
body
and
with
that
mixture
of
gayety
and
ferocity
peculiar
to
southern
people
the
men
began
to
dance
on
his
stomach
singing
while
the
women
that
he
might
better
expiate
his
blasphemies
against
the
pope
cut
or
rather
scalloped
his
lips
with
their
scissors
and
out
of
the
midst
of
this
frightful
group
came
a
cry
or
rather
a
groan
this
death
groan
said
in
the
name
of
heaven
in
the
name
of
the
virgin
in
the
name
of
humanity
kill
me
at
this
cry
was
heard
and
by
common
consent
the
assassins
stood
aside
they
left
the
unfortunate
man
bleeding
disfigured
mangled
to
taste
of
his
death
agony
this
lasted
five
hours
during
which
amid
shouts
of
laughter
insults
and
jeers
from
the
crowd
this
poor
body
lay
palpitating
upon
the
steps
of
the
altar
that
is
how
they
kill
at
avignon
stay
there
is
yet
another
way
a
man
of
the
french
party
conceived
the
idea
of
going
to
the
for
information
everything
was
in
order
there
not
a
fork
or
a
spoon
had
been
removed
it
was
therefore
not
as
an
accomplice
of
theft
that
lescuyer
had
just
been
so
cruelly
murdered
it
was
for
being
a
patriot
there
was
at
that
time
in
avignon
a
man
who
controlled
the
populace
all
these
terrible
leaders
of
the
midi
have
acquired
such
fatal
celebrity
that
it
suffices
to
name
them
for
every
one
even
the
least
educated
to
know
them
this
man
was
jourdan
braggart
and
liar
he
had
made
the
common
people
believe
that
it
was
he
who
had
cut
off
the
head
of
the
governor
of
the
bastille
so
they
called
him
jourdan
that
was
not
his
real
name
which
was
mathieu
jouve
neither
was
he
a
provencal
he
came
from
he
had
formerly
been
a
muleteer
on
those
rugged
heights
which
surround
his
native
town
then
a
soldier
without
going
to
war
war
had
perhaps
made
him
more
human
after
that
he
had
kept
a
in
paris
in
avignon
he
had
been
a
vendor
of
madder
he
collected
three
hundred
men
carried
the
gates
of
the
town
left
half
of
his
troop
to
guard
them
and
with
the
remainder
marched
upon
the
church
of
the
cordeliers
preceded
by
two
pieces
of
cannon
these
he
stationed
in
front
of
the
church
and
fired
them
into
it
at
random
the
assassins
fled
like
a
flock
of
frightened
birds
leaving
some
few
dead
upon
the
church
steps
jourdan
and
his
men
trampled
over
the
bodies
and
entered
the
holy
precincts
no
one
was
there
but
the
virgin
and
the
wretched
lescuyer
still
breathing
jourdan
and
his
comrades
took
good
care
not
to
despatch
lescuyer
his
death
agony
was
a
supreme
means
of
exciting
the
mob
they
picked
up
this
remnant
of
a
sentient
being
dead
and
carried
it
along
bleeding
quivering
gasping
with
them
every
one
fled
from
the
sight
closing
doors
and
windows
at
the
end
of
an
hour
jourdan
and
his
three
hundred
men
were
masters
of
the
town
lescuyer
was
dead
but
what
of
that
they
no
longer
needed
his
agony
jourdan
profited
by
the
terror
he
had
inspired
to
arrest
or
have
arrested
eighty
people
murderers
or
murderers
of
lescuyer
thirty
perhaps
had
never
even
set
foot
within
the
church
but
when
one
has
such
a
good
opportunity
to
be
rid
of
one
s
enemies
one
must
profit
by
it
good
opportunities
are
rare
these
eighty
people
were
huddled
into
the
trouillas
tower
historically
it
is
known
as
the
tower
de
la
glacière
but
why
change
this
name
of
the
trouillas
tower
the
name
is
unclean
and
harmonizes
well
with
the
unclean
deed
which
was
now
to
be
perpetrated
there
it
had
been
the
scene
of
the
inquisitorial
tortures
one
can
still
see
on
the
walls
the
greasy
soot
which
rose
from
the
smoke
of
the
funeral
pyre
where
human
bodies
were
consumed
they
still
show
you
the
instruments
of
torture
which
they
have
carefully
preserved
the
caldron
the
oven
the
wooden
horse
the
chains
the
dungeons
and
even
the
rotten
bones
nothing
is
wanting
it
was
in
this
tower
built
by
clement
that
they
now
confined
the
eighty
prisoners
these
eighty
men
once
arrested
and
locked
up
in
the
trouillas
tower
became
most
embarrassing
who
was
to
judge
them
there
were
no
legally
constituted
courts
except
those
of
the
pope
could
they
kill
these
unfortunates
as
they
had
killed
lescuyer
we
have
said
that
a
third
perhaps
half
of
them
had
not
only
taken
no
part
in
the
murder
but
had
not
even
set
foot
in
the
church
how
should
they
kill
them
the
killing
must
be
placed
upon
the
basis
of
reprisals
but
the
killing
of
these
eighty
people
required
a
certain
number
of
executioners
a
species
of
tribunal
was
improvised
by
jourdan
and
held
session
in
one
of
the
it
had
a
clerk
named
raphel
a
president
half
italian
half
french
an
orator
in
the
popular
dialect
named
barbe
savournin
de
la
roua
and
three
or
four
other
poor
devils
a
baker
a
pork
butcher
their
names
are
lost
in
the
multitude
of
events
these
were
the
men
who
cried
we
must
kill
all
if
one
only
escapes
he
will
be
a
witness
against
but
as
we
have
said
executioners
were
wanting
there
were
barely
twenty
men
at
hand
in
the
courtyard
all
belonging
to
the
petty
tradesfolk
of
avignon
a
barber
a
shoemaker
a
cobbler
a
mason
and
an
upholsterer
all
insufficiently
armed
at
random
the
one
with
a
sabre
the
other
with
a
bayonet
a
third
with
an
iron
bar
and
a
fourth
with
a
bit
of
wood
hardened
by
fire
all
of
these
people
were
chilled
by
a
fine
october
rain
it
would
be
difficult
to
turn
them
into
assassins
pooh
is
anything
too
difficult
for
the
devil
there
comes
an
hour
in
such
crises
when
god
seems
to
abandon
the
earth
then
the
devil
s
chance
comes
the
devil
in
person
entered
this
cold
muddy
courtyard
assuming
the
features
form
and
face
of
an
apothecary
of
the
neighborhood
named
mendes
he
prepared
a
table
lighted
by
two
lanterns
on
which
he
placed
glasses
jugs
pitchers
and
bottles
what
infernal
beverage
did
these
mysterious
and
curiously
formed
receptacles
contain
no
one
ever
knew
but
the
result
is
well
known
all
those
who
drank
that
diabolical
liquor
were
suddenly
seized
with
a
feverish
rage
a
lust
of
blood
and
murder
from
that
moment
it
was
only
necessary
to
show
them
the
door
they
hurtled
madly
into
the
dungeon
the
massacre
lasted
all
night
all
night
the
cries
the
sobs
the
groans
of
the
dying
sounded
through
the
darkness
all
were
killed
all
slaughtered
men
and
women
it
was
long
in
doing
the
killers
we
have
said
were
drunk
and
poorly
armed
but
they
succeeded
among
these
butchers
was
a
child
remarked
for
his
bestial
cruelty
his
immoderate
thirst
for
blood
it
was
lescuyer
s
son
he
killed
and
then
killed
again
he
boasted
of
having
with
his
childish
hand
alone
killed
ten
men
and
four
women
it
s
all
right
i
can
kill
as
i
like
said
he
i
am
not
yet
fifteen
so
they
can
do
nothing
to
me
for
as
the
killing
progressed
they
threw
their
victims
the
living
dead
and
wounded
into
the
trouillas
tower
some
sixty
feet
down
into
the
pit
the
men
were
thrown
in
first
and
the
women
later
the
assassins
wanted
time
to
violate
the
bodies
of
those
who
were
young
and
pretty
at
nine
in
the
morning
after
twelve
hours
of
massacre
a
voice
was
still
heard
crying
from
the
depths
of
the
sepulchre
for
pity
s
sake
come
kill
me
i
can
not
a
man
the
armorer
bouffier
bent
over
the
pit
and
looked
down
the
others
did
not
dare
who
was
that
crying
they
asked
that
was
lami
replied
bouffier
then
when
he
had
returned
they
asked
him
well
what
did
you
see
at
the
bottom
a
queer
marmalade
said
he
men
and
women
priests
and
pretty
girls
all
it
s
enough
to
make
one
die
of
decidedly
man
is
a
vile
creature
said
the
count
of
to
de
villefort
well
it
is
in
this
town
still
reeking
with
blood
still
warm
still
stirred
by
these
last
massacres
that
we
now
introduce
two
of
the
principal
personages
of
our
story
chapter
i
a
table
d
hôte
the
of
october
on
a
beautiful
day
of
that
meridional
autumn
which
ripens
the
oranges

on

way
to

the
ancient
papal
city

a
decree
issued

of

years
earlier

the
carriage
entered
by
the
gate
of

and
without
slackening
speed
traversed
the
entire
length
of
the
town
with
its
narrow
winding
streets
built
to
ward
off
both
wind
and
sun
and
halted
at
fifty
paces
from
the
porte
d
oulle
at
the
hotel
du
which
they
were
again
beginning
to
quietly
rename
the
hotel
du
a
name
which
it
bore
formerly
and
still
bears
these
few
insignificant
words
about
the
name
of
the
inn

which
halted
the
which
we
had
in
view
indicate
sufficiently
well
the
state
of
france
under
the
government
of
the
thermidorian
reaction
called
the
directory
after
the
revolutionary
struggle
which
had
occurred
between
the
of
july
and
the
thermidor
after
the
days
of
the
and
of
october
of

of

of

of

and
his
judges
and
the
queen
and
her
accusers
of
the
girondins
and
the
cordeliers
the
moderates
and
the
jacobins
france
experienced
that
most
frightful
and
most
nauseous
of
all
lassitudes
the
lassitude
of
blood
she
had
therefore
returned
if
not
to
a
need
of
monarchy
at
least
to
a
desire
for
a
stable
government
in
which
she
might
place
her
confidence
upon
which
she
might
lean
which
would
act
for
her
and
which
would
permit
her
some
repose
while
it
acted
in
the
stead
of
this
vaguely
desired
government
the
country
obtained
the
feeble
and
irresolute
directory
composed
for
the
moment
of
the
voluptuous
barrès
the
intriguing
sièyes
the
brave
moulins
the
insignificant
roger
ducos
and
the
honest
but
somewhat
too
ingenuous
gohier
the
result
was
a
mediocre
dignity
before
the
world
at
large
and
a
very
questionable
tranquillity
at
home
it
is
true
that
at
the
moment
of
which
we
write
our
armies
so
glorious
during
those
epic
campaigns
of
and
thrown
back
for
a
time
upon
france
by
the
incapacity
of
scherer
at
verona
and
cassano
and
by
the
defeat
and
death
of
joubert
at
novi
were
beginning
to
resume
the
offensive
moreau
had
defeated
souvarow
at

brune
had
defeated

of

and
general
hermann
at
bergen
masséna
had
annihilated

had
escaped
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
the
austrian
hotz
with
three
other
generals
were
killed
and
five
made
prisoners
masséna
saved
france
at
zurich
as
villars
ninety
years
earlier
had
saved
it
at
denain
but
in
the
interior
matters
were
not
in
so
promising
a
state
and
the
government
of
the
directory
was
it
must
be
confessed
much
embarrassed
between
the
war
in
the
vendée
and
the
brigandages
of
the
midi
to
which
according
to
custom
the
population
of
avignon
were
far
from
remaining
strangers
beyond
doubt
the
two
travellers
who
descended
from
the
carriage
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
du
had
reason
to
fear
the
state
of
mind
in
which
the
always
excitable
papal
town
might
be
at
that
time
for
just
before
reaching
orgon
at
a
spot
where
three
crossroads
stretched
out
before
the
traveller
one
leading
to
nimes
the
second
to
carpentras
the
third
to
avignon
the
postilion
had
stopped
his
horses
and
turning
round
asked
will
the
citizens
go
by
way
of
avignon
or
carpentras
which
of
the
two
roads
is
the
shorter
asked
the
elder
of
the
two
travellers
in
a
harsh
strident
voice
though
visibly
the
elder
he
was
scarcely
thirty
years
of
age
oh
the
road
to
avignon
citizen
by
a
good
four
miles
at
then
he
had
replied
go
by
way
of
and
the
carriage
had
started
again
at
a
gallop
which
proclaimed
that
the
citizen
travellers
as
the
postilion
called
them
although
the
title
of
monsieur
was
beginning
to
reappear
in
conversation
paid
a
fee
of
at
least
thirty
sous
the
same
desire
to
lose
no
time
manifested
itself
at
the
hotel
entrance
there
as
on
the
road
it
was
the
elder
of
the
two
travellers
who
spoke
he
asked
if
they
could
dine
at
once
and
the
way
this
demand
was
made
indicated
that
he
was
ready
to
overlook
many
gastronomical
exigencies
provided
that
the
repast
in
question
be
promptly
served
citizens
replied
the
landlord
who
at
the
sound
of
carriage
wheels
hastened
napkin
in
hand
to
greet
the
travellers
you
will
be
promptly
and
comfortably
served
in
your
room
but
if
you
will
permit
me
to
advise
he
hesitated
oh
go
on
go
on
said
the
younger
of
the
travellers
speaking
for
the
first
time
well
it
would
be
that
you
dine
at
the
table
d
hôte
like
the
traveller
for
whom
this
coach
already
harnessed
is
waiting
the
dinner
is
excellent
and
all
the
host
at
the
same
time
indicated
a
comfortably
appointed
carriage
to
which
were
harnessed
two
horses
who
were
pawing
the
ground
while
the
postilion
sought
patience
in
the
bottle
of
cahors
wine
he
was
emptying
near
the
the
first
movement
of
him
to
whom
this
proposal
was
made
was
negative
nevertheless
after
a
second
s
reflection
the
elder
of
the
two
travellers
as
if
he
had
reconsidered
his
first
decision
made
an
interrogative
sign
to
his
companion
who
replied
with
a
look
which
signified
you
know
that
i
am
at
your
very
well
so
be
it
said
the
other
we
will
dine
at
the
table
d
then
turning
to
the
postilion
who
hat
in
hand
awaited
his
order
he
added
let
the
horses
be
ready
in
a
half
hour
at
the
and
the
landlord
pointing
out
the
way
they
both
entered
the
the
elder
of
the
two
walking
first
the
other
following
him
everyone
knows
the
impression
generally
produced
at
a
table
d
hôte
by
all
eyes
were
bent
upon
them
and
the
conversation
which
seemed
to
be
quite
animated
stopped
the
guests
consisted
of
the
frequenters
of
the
hotel
the
traveller
whose
carriage
was
waiting
harnessed
at
the
door
a
wine
merchant
from
bordeaux
sojourning
temporarily
at
avignon
for
reasons
we
shall
shortly
relate
and
a
certain
number
of
travellers
going
from
marseilles
to
lyons
by
diligence
the
new
arrivals
greeted
the
company
with
a
slight
inclination
of
the
head
and
sat
down
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
table
thereby
isolating
themselves
from
the
other
guests
by
three
or
four
empty
places
this
seemingly
aristocratic
reserve
redoubled
the
curiosity
of
which
they
were
the
object
moreover
they
were
obviously
people
of
unquestionable
distinction
although
their
garments
were
simple
in
the
extreme
both
wore
hightop
boots
and
breeches
coats
travelling
overcoats
and
hats
the
usual
costume
of
the
young
men
of
that
day
but
that
which
distinguished
them
from
the
fashionables
of
paris
and
even
of
the
provinces
was
their
long
straight
hair
and
their
black
stocks
buckled
round
the
neck
military
fashion
the
muscadins
that
was
the
name
then
given
to
young
dandies
the
muscadins
wore
dogs
ears
puffing
at
the
temples
the
rest
of
the
hair
combed
up
tightly
in
a
bag
at
the
back
and
an
immense
cravat
with
long
floating
ends
in
which
the
chin
was
completely
buried
some
had
even
extended
this
reaction
to
powder
as
to
the
personality
of
the
two
young
men
they
presented
two
diametrically
opposite
types
the
elder
of
the
two
he
who
as
we
have
already
remarked
had
taken
the
initiative
several
times
and
whose
voice
even
in
its
most
familiar
intonations
denoted
the
habit
of
command
was
about
thirty
years
of
age
his
black
hair
was
parted
in
the
middle
falling
straight
from
his
temples
to
his
shoulders
he
had
the
swarthy
skin
of
a
man
who
has
travelled
long
in
southern
climes
thin
lips
a
straight
nose
white
teeth
and
those
eyes
which
dante
gives
to
cæsar
he
was
short
rather
than
tall
his
hand
was
delicate
his
foot
slender
and
elegant
his
manner
betrayed
a
certain
awkwardness
suggesting
that
he
was
at
the
moment
wearing
a
costume
to
which
he
was
not
accustomed
and
when
he
spoke
his
hearers
had
they
been
beside
the
loire
instead
of
the
rhone
would
have
detected
a
certain
italian
accent
in
his
pronunciation
his
companion
seemed
to
be
some
three
or
four
years
younger
than
he
he
was
a
handsome
young
man
with
a
rosy
complexion
blond
hair
and
light
blue
eyes
a
straight
firm
nose
and
prominent
but
almost
beardless
chin
he
was
perhaps
a
couple
of
inches
taller
than
his
companion
and
though
his
figure
was
somewhat
above
medium
height
he
was
so
well
proportioned
so
admirably
free
in
his
movements
that
he
was
evidently
if
not
extraordinarily
strong
at
least
uncommonly
agile
and
dexterous
although
attired
in
the
same
manner
and
apparently
on
a
footing
of
equality
he
evinced
remarkable
deference
to
the
dark
young
man
which
as
it
could
not
result
from
age
was
doubtless
caused
by
some
inferiority
of
position
moreover
he
called
his
companion
citizen
while
the
other
addressed
him
as
roland
these
remarks
which
we
make
to
initiate
the
reader
more
profoundly
into
our
story
were
probably
not
made
as
extensively
by
the
guests
at
the
table
d
hôte
for
after
bestowing
a
few
seconds
of
attention
upon
the
they
turned
their
eyes
away
and
the
conversation
interrupted
for
an
instant
was
resumed
it
must
be
confessed
that
it
concerned
a
matter
most
interesting
to
the
travellers
that
of
the
stoppage
of
a
diligence
bearing
a
sum
of
sixty
thousand
francs
belonging
to
the
government
the
affair
had
occurred
the
day
before
on
the
road
from
marseilles
to
avignon
between
lambesc
and
at
the
first
words
referring
to
this
event
the
two
young
men
listened
with
unmistakable
interest
it
had
taken
place
on
the
same
road
which
they
had
just
followed
and
the
narrator
the
wine
merchant
of
bordeaux
had
been
one
of
the
principal
actors
in
the
scene
on
the
highroad
those
who
seemed
the
most
curious
to
hear
the
details
were
the
travellers
in
the
diligence
which
had
just
arrived
and
was
soon
to
depart
the
other
guests
who
belonged
to
the
locality
seemed
sufficiently
conversant
with
such
catastrophes
to
furnish
the
details
themselves
instead
of
listening
to
them
so
citizen
said
a
stout
gentleman
against
whom
a
tall
woman
very
thin
and
haggard
was
crowding
in
her
terror
you
say
that
the
robbery
took
place
on
the
very
road
by
which
we
have
just
come
yes
citizen
between
lambesc
and
did
you
notice
the
spot
where
the
road
ascends
between
two
high
banks
there
are
a
great
many
rocks
yes
yes
my
friend
said
the
wife
pressing
her
husband
s
arm
i
noticed
it
i
even
said
as
you
must
remember
here
is
a
bad
place
i
would
rather
pass
here
by
day
than
at
oh
madame
said
a
young
man
whose
voice
affected
to
slur
his
r
s
after
the
fashion
of
the
day
and
who
probably
assumed
to
lead
the
conversation
at
the
table
d
hôte
on
ordinary
occasions
you
know
the
companions
of
jehu
know
no
day
or
what
citizen
asked
the
lady
still
more
alarmed
were
you
attacked
in
broad
daylight
in
broad
daylight
citizeness
at
ten
o
clock
in
the
and
how
many
were
there
asked
the
stout
gentleman
four
ambushed
beside
the
road
no
they
were
on
horseback
armed
to
the
teeth
and
that
s
their
custom
said
the
young
frequenter
of
the
table
d
hôte
and
they
said
did
they
not
do
not
defend
yourself
we
will
not
harm
you
we
only
want
the
government
word
for
word
then
continued
this
young
man
two
dismounted
from
their
horses
flinging
their
bridles
to
their
comrades
and
commanded
the
conductor
to
deliver
up
the
citizen
said
the
stout
man
astonished
you
describe
the
thing
as
if
you
had
seen
monsieur
was
there
perhaps
said
one
of
the
travellers
half
in
jest
half
in
earnest
i
do
not
know
citizen
whether
in
saying
that
you
intend
a
rudeness
carelessly
observed
the
young
man
who
had
so
pertinently
and
obligingly
come
to
the
narrator
s
assistance
but
my
political
opinions
are
such
that
i
do
not
consider
your
suspicion
an
insult
had
i
had
the
misfortune
to
be
among
those
attacked
or
the
honor
to
be
one
of
those
who
made
the
attack
i
should
admit
it
as
frankly
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
but
yesterday
at
ten
o
clock
at
precisely
the
moment
when
the
diligence
was
stopped
twelve
miles
from
here
i
was
breakfasting
quietly
in
this
very
seat
and
with
the
two
citizens
who
now
do
me
the
honor
to
sit
beside
and
asked
the
younger
of
the
two
travellers
who
had
lately
joined
the
table
whom
his
companion
called
roland
how
many
men
were
you
in
the
diligence
let
me
think
we
were
yes
that
s
it
we
were
seven
men
and
three
seven
men
not
including
the
conductor
repeated
roland
and
you
seven
men
allowed
yourselves
to
be
plundered
by
four
brigands
i
congratulate
you
we
knew
with
whom
we
had
to
deal
replied
the
wine
merchant
and
we
took
good
care
not
to
defend
what
with
whom
you
had
to
deal
retorted
the
young
man
why
it
seems
to
me
with
thieves
and
not
at
all
they
gave
their
they
gave
their
names
they
said
gentlemen
it
is
useless
to
defend
yourselves
ladies
do
not
be
alarmed
we
are
not
bandits
we
are
companions
of
yes
said
the
young
man
of
the
table
d
hôte
they
warned
you
that
there
might
be
no
misunderstanding
that
s
their
ah
indeed
exclaimed
roland
and
who
is
this
jehu
who
has
such
polite
companions
is
he
their
captain
sir
said
a
man
whose
dress
betrayed
somewhat
the
secularized
priest
and
who
seemed
also
to
be
not
only
an
habitual
guest
at
the
table
d
hôte
but
also
an
initiate
into
the
mysteries
of
the
honorable
company
whose
merits
were
then
under
discussion
if
you
were
better
versed
than
you
seem
to
be
in
the
holy
scriptures
you
would
know
that
this
jehu
died
something
like
two
thousand
six
hundred
years
ago
and
that
consequently
he
can
not
at
the
present
time
stop
coaches
on
the
monsieur
l
abbé
replied
roland
who
had
recognized
an
ecclesiastic
as
in
spite
of
the
sharp
tone
in
which
you
speak
you
seem
a
man
of
learning
permit
a
poor
ignoramus
to
ask
you
a
few
details
about
this
jehu
dead
these
two
thousand
six
hundred
years
who
nevertheless
is
honored
by
followers
bearing
his
jehu
replied
the
churchman
in
the
same
sour
tone
was
a
king
of
israel
anointed
by
elisha
on
condition
that
he
punish
the
crimes
of
the
house
of
ahab
and
jezbel
and
put
to
death
the
priests
of
monsieur
l
abbé
replied
the
young
man
laughing
i
thank
you
for
the
explanation
i
don
t
doubt
it
is
correct
and
above
all
very
learned
but
i
must
admit
it
doesn
t
tell
me
what
citizen
exclaimed
the
abbé
don
t
you
understand
that
jehu
is
his
majesty
louis
anointed
on
condition
that
he
punish
the
crimes
of
the
revolution
and
put
to
death
all
the
priests
of
baal
that
is
to
say
all
those
who
had
taken
any
part
whatsoever
in
the
abominable
state
of
things
which
for
these
last
seven
years
has
been
called
the
republic
yes
indeed
exclaimed
the
young
man
of
course
i
understand
but
among
those
whom
the
companions
of
jehu
are
appointed
to
fight
do
you
reckon
the
brave
soldiers
who
have
repulsed
the
enemy
along
the
frontiers
of
france
and
the
illustrious
generals
who
have
commanded
the
armies
of
the
tyrol
the
and
of
italy
why
beyond
doubt
those
foremost
and
before
the
young
man
s
eyes
flashed
lightning
his
nostrils
quivered
and
his
lips
tightened
he
rose
from
his
chair
but
his
comrade
touched
his
coat
and
forced
him
to
sit
down
again
while
with
a
single
glance
he
silenced
him
then
he
who
had
thus
given
proof
of
his
power
speaking
for
the
first
time
addressed
the
young
man
of
the
table
d
hôte
citizen
excuse
two
travellers
who
are
just
arrived
from
the
end
of
the
earth
from
america
or
india
as
it
were
absent
from
france
these
last
two
years
we
are
completely
ignorant
of
all
that
has
occurred
here
and
most
desirous
to
obtain
why
as
to
that
replied
the
young
man
to
whom
these
words
were
addressed
that
is
but
fair
citizen
question
us
and
we
will
answer
well
continued
the
dark
young
man
with
the
eagle
eye
the
straight
black
hair
and
the
granite
complexion
now
that
i
know
who
jehu
is
and
to
what
end
his
company
was
instituted
i
should
like
to
know
what
his
companions
do
with
the
money
they
oh
that
is
very
simple
citizen
you
know
there
is
much
talk
of
the
restoration
of
the
bourbon
monarchy
no
i
did
not
know
it
replied
the
dark
young
man
in
a
tone
which
he
vainly
strove
to
render
artless
i
am
but
just
arrived
as
i
told
you
from
the
end
of
the
what
you
did
not
know
that
well
six
months
hence
it
will
be
an
accomplished
really
i
have
the
honor
to
tell
you
so
the
two
young
men
exchanged
a
glance
and
a
smile
though
the
young
blond
one
was
apparently
chafing
under
the
weight
of
his
extreme
impatience
their
informant
continued
lyons
is
the
headquarters
of
the
conspiracy
if
one
can
call
conspiracy
a
plot
which
was
organized
openly
the
provisional
government
would
be
a
more
suitable
well
then
citizen
said
the
dark
young
man
with
a
politeness
not
wholly
exempt
from
satire
let
us
call
it
provisional
this
provisional
government
has
its
staff
and
its
bah
its
staff
perhaps
but
its
armies
its
armies
i
where
are
they
one
is
being
organized
in
the
mountains
of
auvergne
under
the
orders
of
de
chardon
another
in
the
jura
mountains
under
teyssonnet
and
finally
a
third
is
operating
most
successfully
at
this
time
in
the
vendée
under
the
orders
of
escarboville
achille
leblond
and
truly
citizen
you
render
me
a
real
service
in
telling
me
this
i
thought
the
bourbons
completely
resigned
to
their
exile
i
supposed
the
police
so
organized
as
to
suppress
both
provisional
royalist
committees
in
the
large
towns
and
bandits
on
the
highways
in
fact
i
believed
the
vendée
had
been
completely
pacificated
by
the
young
man
to
whom
this
reply
was
addressed
burst
out
laughing
why
where
do
you
come
from
he
exclaimed
i
told
you
citizen
from
the
end
of
the
so
it
then
he
continued
you
understand
the
bourbons
are
not
rich
the
émigrés
whose
property
was
confiscated
are
ruined
it
is
impossible
to
organize
two
armies
and
maintain
a
third
without
money
the
royalists
faced
an
embarrassing
problem
the
republic
alone
could
pay
for
its
enemies
troops
and
it
being
improbable
that
she
would
do
so
of
her
own
volition
the
shady
negotiation
was
abandoned
and
it
was
adjudged
quicker
to
take
the
money
without
permission
than
to
ask
her
for
ah
i
understand
at
that
s
very
companions
of
jehu
then
are
the
intermediaries
between
the
republic
and
the
the
of
the
royalist
generals
yes
it
is
not
robbery
but
a
military
operation
rather
a
feat
of
arms
like
any
other
so
there
you
are
citizen
and
now
you
are
as
well
informed
on
this
point
as
but
timidly
hazarded
the
wine
merchant
of
bordeaux
if
the
companions
of
jehu
observe
that
i
say
nothing
against
them
want
the
government
money
the
government
money
no
other
individual
plunder
on
their
part
is
unheard
how
does
it
happen
then
that
yesterday
in
addition
to
the
government
money
they
carried
off
two
hundred
louis
of
mine
my
dear
sir
replied
the
young
man
of
the
table
d
hôte
i
have
already
told
you
that
there
is
some
mistake
as
surely
as
my
name
is
alfred
de
barjols
this
money
will
be
returned
to
you
some
the
wine
merchant
heaved
a
sigh
and
shook
his
head
as
if
in
spite
of
that
assurance
he
still
retained
some
doubts
but
at
this
moment
as
if
the
promise
given
by
the
young
noble
who
had
just
revealed
his
social
position
by
telling
his
name
had
stirred
the
delicacy
of
those
whom
he
thus
guaranteed
a
horse
stopped
at
the
entrance
steps
were
heard
in
the
corridor
the
door
opened
and
a
masked
man
armed
to
the
teeth
appeared
on
the
threshold
gentlemen
said
he
in
the
profound
silence
occasioned
by
his
apparition
is
there
a
traveller
here
named
jean
picot
who
was
in
the
diligence
that
was
held
up
yesterday
between
lambesc
and
yes
said
the
wine
merchant
amazed
are
you
he
asked
the
masked
man
i
was
anything
taken
from
you
oh
yes
two
hundred
louis
which
i
had
intrusted
to
the
and
i
may
add
said
the
young
noble
that
the
gentleman
was
speaking
of
it
at
this
very
moment
he
looked
upon
it
as
the
gentleman
was
wrong
said
the
masked
unknown
we
war
upon
the
government
and
not
against
individuals
we
are
partisans
and
not
robbers
here
are
your
two
hundred
louis
sir
and
if
a
similar
mistake
should
occur
in
the
future
claim
your
loss
mentioning
the
name
of
so
saying
the
masked
individual
deposited
a
bag
of
gold
beside
the
wine
merchant
bowed
courteously
to
the
other
guests
and
went
out
leaving
some
terrified
and
others
bewildered
by
such
daring
chapter
ii
an
italian
proverb
although
the
two
sentiments
which
we
have
just
indicated
were
the
dominant
ones
they
did
not
manifest
themselves
to
an
equal
degree
in
all
present
the
shades
were
graduated
according
to
the
sex
age
character
we
may
almost
say
the
social
positions
of
the
hearers
the
wine
merchant
jean
picot
the
principal
personage
in
the
late
event
recognizing
at
first
sight
by
his
dress
weapons
mask
one
of
the
men
who
had
stopped
the
coach
on
the
preceding
day
was
at
first
sight
stupefied
then
little
by
little
as
he
grasped
the
purport
of
this
mysterious
brigand
s
visit
to
him
he
had
passed
from
stupefaction
to
joy
through
the
intermediate
phases
separating
these
two
emotions
his
bag
of
gold
was
beside
him
yet
he
seemingly
dared
not
touch
it
perhaps
he
feared
that
the
instant
his
hand
went
forth
toward
it
it
would
melt
like
the
which
vanishes
during
that
period
of
progressive
lucidity
which
separates
profound
slumber
from
thorough
awakening
the
stout
gentleman
of
the
diligence
and
his
wife
had
displayed
like
their
travelling
companions
the
most
absolute
and
complete
terror
seated
to
the
left
of
jean
picot
when
the
bandit
approached
the
wine
merchant
the
husband
in
the
vain
hope
of
maintaining
a
respectable
distance
between
himself
and
the
companion
of
jehu
pushed
his
chair
back
against
that
of
his
wife
who
yielding
to
the
pressure
in
turn
endeavored
to
push
back
hers
but
as
the
next
chair
was
occupied
by
citizen
alfred
de
barjols
who
had
no
reason
to
fear
these
men
whom
he
had
just
praised
so
highly
the
chair
of
the
stout
man
s
wife
encountered
an
obstacle
in
the
immovability
of
the
young
noble
so
as
at
marengo
eight
or
nine
months
later
when
the
general
in
command
judged
it
time
to
resume
the
offensive
the
retrograde
movement
was
arrested
as
for
him
we
are
speaking
of
the
citizen
alfred
de
barjols
his
attitude
like
that
of
the
abbé
who
had
given
the
biblical
explanation
about
jehu
king
of
israel
and
his
mission
from
elisha
his
attitude
we
say
was
that
of
a
man
who
not
only
experiences
no
fear
but
who
even
expects
the
event
in
question
however
unexpected
it
may
be
his
lips
wore
a
smile
as
he
watched
the
masked
man
and
had
the
guests
not
been
so
preoccupied
with
the
two
principal
actors
in
this
scene
they
might
have
remarked
the
almost
imperceptible
sign
exchanged
between
the
eyes
of
the
bandit
and
the
young
noble
and
transmitted
instantly
by
the
latter
to
the
abbé
the
two
travellers
whom
we
introduced
to
the
table
d
hôte
and
who
as
we
have
said
sat
apart
at
the
end
of
the
table
preserved
an
attitude
conformable
to
their
respective
characters
the
younger
of
the
two
had
instinctively
put
his
hand
to
his
side
as
if
to
seek
an
absent
weapon
and
had
risen
with
a
spring
as
if
to
rush
at
the
masked
man
s
throat
in
which
purpose
he
had
certainly
not
failed
had
he
been
alone
but
the
elder
who
seemed
to
possess
not
only
the
habit
but
the
right
of
command
contented
himself
by
regrasping
his
coat
and
saying
in
an
imperious
almost
harsh
tone
sit
down
roland
and
the
young
man
had
resumed
his
seat
but
one
of
the
guests
had
remained
in
appearance
at
least
the
most
impassible
during
this
scene
he
was
a
man
between
and
years
of
age
with
blond
hair
red
beard
a
calm
handsome
face
with
large
blue
eyes
a
fair
skin
refined
and
intelligent
lips
and
very
tall
whose
foreign
accent
betrayed
one
born
in
that
island
of
which
the
government
was
at
that
time
waging
bitter
war
against
france
as
far
as
could
be
judged
by
the
few
words
which
had
escaped
him
he
spoke
the
french
language
with
rare
purity
despite
the
accent
we
have
just
mentioned
at
the
first
word
he
uttered
in
which
that
english
accent
revealed
itself
the
elder
of
the
two
travellers
started
turning
to
his
companion
he
asked
with
a
glance
to
which
the
other
seemed
accustomed
how
it
was
that
an
englishman
should
be
in
france
when
the
uncompromising
war
between
the
two
nations
had
naturally
exiled
all
englishmen
from
france
as
it
had
all
frenchmen
from
england
no
doubt
the
explanation
seemed
impossible
to
roland
for
he
had
replied
with
his
eyes
and
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
i
find
it
quite
as
extraordinary
as
you
but
if
you
mathematician
as
you
are
can
t
solve
the
problem
don
t
ask
me
it
was
evident
to
the
two
young
men
that
the
fair
man
with
the
accent
was
the
traveller
whose
comfortable
carriage
awaited
him
harnessed
in
the
courtyard
and
that
this
traveller
hailed
from
london
or
at
least
from
some
part
of
great
britain
as
to
his
remarks
they
as
we
have
stated
were
infrequent
so
laconic
in
reality
that
they
were
mere
exclamations
rather
than
speech
but
each
time
an
explanation
had
been
asked
concerning
the
state
of
france
the
englishman
openly
drew
out
a
and
requested
those
about
him
the
wine
merchant
the
abbé
or
the
young
noble
to
repeat
their
remarks
to
which
each
had
complied
with
an
amiability
equal
to
the
courteous
tone
of
the
request
he
had
noted
down
the
most
important
extraordinary
and
picturesque
features
of
the
robbery
of
the
diligence
the
state
of
vendée
and
the
details
about
the
companions
of
jehu
thanking
each
informant
by
voice
and
gesture
with
the
stiffness
peculiar
to
our
insular
cousins
replacing
his
enriched
each
time
by
a
new
item
in
a
side
pocket
of
his
overcoat
finally
like
a
spectator
enjoying
an
unexpected
scene
he
had
given
a
cry
of
satisfaction
at
sight
of
the
masked
man
had
listened
with
all
his
ears
gazed
with
all
his
eyes
not
losing
him
from
sight
until
the
door
closed
behind
him
then
drawing
his
hastily
from
his
pocket
ah
sir
he
said
to
his
neighbor
who
was
no
other
than
the
abbé
will
you
be
so
kind
should
my
memory
fail
me
as
to
repeat
what
that
gentleman
who
has
just
gone
out
said
he
began
to
write
immediately
and
the
abbé
s
memory
agreeing
with
his
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
transcribing
literally
and
verbatim
the
speech
made
by
the
companion
of
jehu
to
citizen
jean
picot
then
this
conversation
written
down
he
exclaimed
with
an
accent
that
lent
a
singular
stamp
of
originality
to
his
words
of
a
truth
it
is
only
in
france
that
such
things
can
happen
france
is
the
most
curious
country
in
the
world
i
am
delighted
gentlemen
to
travel
in
france
and
become
acquainted
with
the
last
sentence
was
said
with
such
courtesy
that
nothing
remained
save
to
thank
the
speaker
from
whose
serious
mouth
it
issued
though
he
was
a
descendant
of
the
conquerors
of
crecy
poitiers
and
agincourt
it
was
the
younger
of
the
two
travellers
who
acknowledged
this
politeness
in
that
heedless
and
rather
caustic
manner
which
seemed
habitual
to
him
pon
my
word
i
am
exactly
like
you
my
lord
i
say
my
lord
because
i
presume
you
are
yes
sir
replied
the
gentleman
i
have
that
well
as
i
was
saying
continued
the
young
man
i
am
delighted
to
travel
in
france
and
see
what
i
am
seeing
one
must
live
under
the
government
of
citizens
gohier
moulins
roger
ducos
sièyes
and
barras
to
witness
such
roguery
i
dare
wager
than
when
the
tale
is
told
fifty
years
hence
of
the
highwayman
who
rode
into
a
city
of
thirty
thousand
inhabitants
in
broad
day
masked
and
armed
with
two
pistols
and
a
sword
at
his
belt
to
return
the
two
hundred
louis
which
he
had
stolen
the
day
previous
to
the
honest
merchant
who
was
then
deploring
their
loss
and
when
it
is
added
that
this
occurred
at
a
table
d
hôte
where
twenty
or
people
were
seated
and
that
this
model
bandit
was
allowed
to
depart
without
one
of
those
twenty
or
people
daring
to
molest
him
i
dare
wager
i
repeat
that
whoever
has
the
audacity
to
tell
the
story
will
be
branded
as
an
infamous
and
the
young
man
throwing
himself
back
in
his
chair
burst
into
laughter
so
aggressive
so
nervous
that
every
one
gazed
at
him
in
wonderment
while
his
companion
s
eyes
expressed
an
almost
paternal
anxiety
sir
said
citizen
alfred
de
barjols
who
moved
like
the
others
by
this
singular
outburst
more
sad
or
rather
dolorous
than
gay
had
waited
for
its
last
echo
to
subside
sir
permit
me
to
point
out
to
you
that
the
man
whom
you
have
just
seen
is
not
a
bah
frankly
what
is
he
then
he
is
in
all
probability
a
young
man
of
as
good
a
family
as
yours
or
count
horn
whom
the
regent
ordered
broken
on
the
wheel
at
the
place
de
grève
was
also
a
man
of
good
family
and
the
proof
is
that
all
the
nobility
of
paris
sent
their
carriages
to
his
count
horn
if
i
remember
rightly
murdered
a
jew
to
steal
a
note
of
hand
which
he
was
unable
to
meet
no
one
would
dare
assert
that
a
companion
of
jehu
had
ever
so
much
as
harmed
the
hair
of
an
well
be
it
so
we
will
admit
that
the
company
was
founded
upon
a
philanthropic
basis
to
the
balance
of
fortunes
redress
the
whims
of
chance
and
reform
the
abuses
of
society
though
he
may
be
a
robber
after
the
fashion
of
karl
moor
your
friend
morgan
was
it
not
morgan
that
this
honest
citizen
called
himself
yes
said
the
englishman
well
your
friend
morgan
is
none
the
less
a
citizen
alfred
de
barjols
turned
very
pale
citizen
morgan
is
not
my
friend
replied
the
young
aristocrat
but
if
he
were
i
should
feel
honored
by
his
no
doubt
replied
roland
laughing
as
voltaire
says
the
friendship
of
a
great
man
is
a
blessing
from
the
roland
roland
observed
his
comrade
in
a
low
tone
oh
general
replied
the
latter
letting
his
companion
s
rank
escape
him
perhaps
intentionally
i
implore
you
let
me
continue
this
discussion
which
interests
me
in
the
highest
his
friend
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
citizen
continued
the
young
man
with
strange
persistence
i
stand
in
need
of
correction
i
left
france
two
years
ago
and
during
my
absence
so
many
things
have
changed
such
as
dress
morals
and
accents
that
even
the
language
may
have
changed
also
in
the
language
of
the
day
in
france
what
do
you
call
stopping
coaches
and
taking
the
money
which
they
contain
sir
said
the
young
noble
in
the
tone
of
a
man
determined
to
sustain
his
argument
to
its
end
i
call
that
war
here
is
your
companion
whom
you
have
just
called
general
he
as
a
military
man
will
tell
you
that
apart
from
the
pleasure
of
killing
and
being
killed
the
generals
of
all
ages
have
never
done
anything
else
than
what
the
citizen
morgan
is
doing
what
exclaimed
the
young
man
whose
eyes
flashed
fire
you
dare
to
compare
permit
the
gentleman
to
develop
his
theory
roland
said
the
dark
traveller
whose
eyes
unlike
those
of
his
companion
which
dilated
as
they
flamed
were
veiled
by
long
black
lashes
thus
concealing
all
that
was
passing
in
his
mind
ah
said
the
young
man
in
his
curt
tone
you
see
that
you
yourself
are
becoming
interested
in
the
then
turning
to
the
young
noble
whom
he
seemed
to
have
selected
for
his
antagonist
he
said
continue
sir
continue
the
general
permits
the
young
noble
flushed
as
visibly
as
he
had
paled
a
moment
before
between
clinched
teeth
his
elbow
on
the
table
his
chin
on
his
clinched
hand
as
if
to
draw
as
close
to
his
adversary
as
possible
he
said
with
a
provençal
accent
which
grew
more
pronounced
as
the
discussion
waxed
hotter
since
permits
emphasizing
the
two
words
i
shall
have
the
honor
to
tell
him
and
you
too
citizen
that
i
believe
i
have
read
in
plutarch
that
alexander
the
great
when
he
started
for
india
took
with
him
but
eighteen
or
twenty
talents
in
gold
something
like
one
hundred
or
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
francs
now
do
you
suppose
that
with
these
eighteen
or
twenty
talents
alone
he
fed
his
army
won
the
battle
of
granicus
subdued
asia
minor
conquered
tyre
gaza
syria
and
egypt
built
alexandria
penetrated
to
lybia
had
himself
declared
son
of
jupiter
by
the
oracle
of
ammon
penetrated
as
far
as
the
hyphases
and
when
his
soldiers
refused
to
follow
him
further
returned
to
babylon
where
he
surpassed
in
luxury
debauchery
and
the
most
debauched
and
voluptuous
of
the
kings
of
asia
did
macedonia
furnish
his
supplies
do
you
believe
that
king
philip
most
indigent
of
the
kings
of
greece
honored
the
drafts
his
son
drew
upon
him
not
so
alexander
did
as
citizen
morgan
is
doing
only
instead
of
stopping
the
coaches
on
the
highroads
he
pillaged
cities
held
kings
for
ransom
levied
contributions
from
the
conquered
countries
let
us
turn
to
hannibal
you
know
how
he
left
carthage
don
t
you
he
did
not
have
even
the
eighteen
or
twenty
talents
of
his
predecessor
and
as
he
needed
money
he
seized
and
sacked
the
city
of
saguntum
in
the
midst
of
peace
in
defiance
of
the
fealty
of
treaties
after
that
he
was
rich
and
could
begin
his
campaign
forgive
me
if
this
time
i
no
longer
quote
plutarch
but
cornelius
nepos
i
will
spare
you
the
details
of
his
descent
from
the
pyrenees
how
he
crossed
the
alps
and
the
three
battles
which
he
won
seizing
each
time
the
treasures
of
the
vanquished
and
turn
to
the
five
or
six
years
he
spent
in
campania
do
you
believe
that
he
and
his
army
paid
the
capuans
for
their
subsistence
and
that
the
bankers
of
carthage
with
whom
he
had
quarrelled
supplied
him
with
funds
no
war
fed
war
the
morgan
system
citizen
let
us
pass
on
to
cæsar
ah
cæsar
that
s
another
story
he
left
for
spain
with
some
thirty
millions
of
debt
and
returned
with
practically
the
same
he
started
for
gaul
where
he
spent
ten
years
with
our
ancestors
during
these
ten
years
he
sent
over
one
hundred
millions
to
rome
repassed
the
alps
crossed
the
rubicon
marched
straight
to
the
capitol
forced
the
gates
of
the
temple
of
saturn
where
the
treasury
was
seized
sufficient
for
his
private
needs
and
not
for
those
of
the
republic
three
thousand
pounds
of
gold
in
ingots
and
died
he
whom
creditors
twenty
years
earlier
refused
to
allow
to
leave
his
little
house
in
the
suburra
leaving
two
or
three
thousand
sesterces
per
head
to
the
citizens
ten
or
twelve
millions
to
calpurnia
and
thirty
or
forty
millions
to
octavius
always
the
morgan
system
save
that
morgan
i
am
sure
would
die
sooner
than
subvert
to
his
personal
needs
either
the
silver
of
the
gauls
or
the
gold
of
the
capital
now
let
us
spring
over
eighteen
centuries
and
come
to
the
general
and
the
young
aristocrat
after
the
fashion
of
the
enemies
of
the
conqueror
of
italy
affected
to
emphasize
the
which
bonaparte
had
eliminated
from
his
name
and
the
from
which
he
had
removed
the
accent
this
affectation
seemed
to
irritate
roland
intensely
he
made
a
movement
as
if
to
spring
forward
but
his
companion
stopped
him
let
be
said
he
let
be
roland
i
am
quite
sure
that
citizen
barjols
will
not
say
the
general
buonaparté
as
he
calls
him
is
a
no
i
will
not
say
it
but
there
is
an
italian
proverb
which
says
it
for
what
is
the
proverb
demanded
the
general
in
his
companion
s
stead
fixing
his
calm
limpid
eye
upon
the
young
noble
i
give
it
in
all
its
simplicity
francesi
non
sono
tutti
ladroni
ma
buona
parte
which
means
all
frenchmen
are
not
thieves
but
a
good
part
are
concluded
roland
yes
buonaparté
replied
alfred
de
barjols
scarcely
had
these
insolent
words
left
the
young
aristocrat
s
lips
than
the
plate
with
which
roland
was
playing
flew
from
his
hands
and
struck
de
barjols
full
in
the
face
the
women
screamed
the
men
rose
to
their
feet
roland
burst
into
that
nervous
laugh
which
was
habitual
with
him
and
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
the
young
aristocrat
remained
calm
although
the
blood
was
trickling
from
his
brow
to
his
cheek
at
this
moment
the
conductor
entered
with
the
usual
formula
come
citizen
travellers
take
your
the
travellers
anxious
to
leave
the
scene
of
the
quarrel
rushed
to
the
door
pardon
me
sir
said
alfred
de
barjols
to
roland
you
do
not
go
by
diligence
i
hope
no
sir
i
travel
by
post
but
you
need
have
no
fear
i
shall
not
nor
i
said
the
englishman
have
them
unharness
my
horses
i
shall
i
must
go
sighed
the
dark
young
man
whom
roland
had
addressed
as
general
you
know
it
is
necessary
my
friend
my
presence
yonder
is
absolutely
imperative
but
i
swear
that
i
would
not
leave
you
if
i
could
possibly
avoid
in
saying
these
words
his
voice
betrayed
an
emotion
of
which
judging
from
its
usual
harsh
metallic
ring
it
had
seemed
incapable
roland
on
the
contrary
seemed
overjoyed
his
belligerent
nature
seemed
to
expand
at
the
approach
of
a
danger
to
which
he
had
perhaps
not
given
rise
but
which
he
at
least
had
not
endeavored
to
avoid
good
general
he
said
we
were
to
part
at
lyons
since
you
have
had
the
kindness
to
grant
me
a
month
s
furlough
to
visit
my
family
at
bourg
it
is
merely
some
hundred
and
sixty
miles
or
so
less
than
we
intended
that
is
all
i
shall
rejoin
you
in
paris
but
you
know
if
you
need
a
devoted
arm
and
a
man
who
never
sulks
think
of
me
you
may
rest
easy
on
that
score
roland
exclaimed
the
general
then
looking
attentively
at
the
two
adversaries
he
added
with
an
indescribable
note
of
tenderness
above
all
roland
do
not
let
yourself
be
killed
but
if
it
is
a
possible
thing
don
t
kill
your
adversary
everything
considered
he
is
a
gallant
man
and
the
day
will
come
when
i
shall
need
such
men
at
my
i
shall
do
my
best
general
don
t
be
at
this
moment
the
landlord
appeared
upon
the
of
the
door
the
is
ready
said
he
the
general
took
his
hat
and
his
cane
which
he
had
laid
upon
the
chair
roland
on
the
contrary
followed
him
bareheaded
that
all
might
see
plainly
he
did
not
intend
to
leave
with
his
friend
alfred
de
barjols
therefore
offered
no
opposition
to
his
leaving
the
room
besides
it
was
easy
to
see
that
his
adversary
was
of
those
who
seek
rather
than
avoid
quarrels
just
the
same
said
the
general
seating
himself
in
the
carriage
to
which
roland
had
escorted
him
my
heart
is
heavy
at
leaving
you
thus
roland
without
a
friend
to
act
as
your
good
don
t
worry
about
that
general
seconds
are
never
lacking
there
are
and
always
will
be
enough
men
who
are
curious
to
see
how
one
man
can
kill
au
revoir
roland
observe
i
do
not
say
farewell
but
au
revoir
yes
my
dear
general
replied
the
young
man
in
a
voice
that
revealed
some
emotion
i
understand
and
i
thank
promise
that
you
will
send
me
word
as
soon
as
the
affair
is
over
or
that
you
will
get
some
one
to
write
if
you
are
oh
don
t
worry
general
you
will
have
a
letter
from
me
personally
in
less
than
four
days
replied
roland
adding
in
a
tone
of
profound
bitterness
have
you
not
perceived
that
i
am
protected
by
a
fatality
which
prevents
me
from
dying
roland
exclaimed
the
general
in
a
severe
tone
again
nothing
nothing
said
the
young
man
shaking
his
head
and
assuming
an
expression
of
careless
gayety
which
must
have
been
habitual
with
him
before
the
occurrence
of
that
unknown
misfortune
which
oppressed
his
youth
with
this
longing
for
death
very
well
by
the
way
try
to
find
out
one
what
is
that
general
how
it
happens
that
at
a
time
when
we
are
at
war
with
england
an
englishman
stalks
about
france
as
freely
and
as
easily
as
if
he
were
at
good
i
will
find
how
i
do
not
know
but
when
i
promise
you
to
find
out
i
shall
do
so
though
i
have
to
ask
it
of
reckless
fellow
don
t
get
yourself
involved
in
another
affair
in
that
in
any
case
it
would
not
be
a
duel
it
would
be
a
battle
as
he
is
a
national
well
once
more
till
i
see
you
again
embrace
roland
flung
himself
with
passionate
gratitude
upon
the
neck
of
the
personage
who
had
just
given
him
this
permission
oh
general
he
exclaimed
how
happy
i
should
be
if
i
were
not
so
unhappy
the
general
looked
at
him
with
profound
affection
then
asked
one
day
you
will
tell
me
what
this
sorrow
is
will
you
not
roland
roland
laughed
that
sorrowful
laugh
which
had
already
escaped
his
lips
once
or
twice
oh
my
word
no
said
he
you
would
ridicule
me
too
the
general
stared
at
him
as
one
would
contemplate
a
madman
after
all
he
murmured
one
must
accept
men
as
they
especially
when
they
are
not
what
they
seem
to
you
must
mistake
me
for
oedipe
since
you
pose
me
with
these
enigmas
ah
if
you
guess
this
one
general
i
will
herald
you
king
of
thebes
but
with
all
my
follies
i
forgot
that
your
time
is
precious
and
that
i
am
detaining
you
needlessly
with
my
that
is
so
have
you
any
commissions
for
paris
yes
three
my
regards
to
bourrienne
my
respects
to
your
brother
lucien
and
my
most
tender
homage
to
madame
i
will
deliver
where
shall
i
find
you
in
paris
at
my
house
in
the
rue
de
la
victoire
perhaps
who
knows
perhaps
at
luxembourg
then
throwing
himself
back
as
if
he
regretted
having
said
so
much
even
to
a
man
he
regarded
as
his
best
friend
he
shouted
to
the
postilion
road
to
orange
as
fast
as
the
postilion
who
was
only
waiting
for
the
order
whipped
up
his
horses
the
carriage
departed
rapidly
rumbling
like
a
roll
of
thunder
and
disappeared
through
the
porte
d
oulle
chapter
iii
the
englishman
roland
remained
motionless
not
only
as
long
as
he
could
see
the
carriage
but
long
after
it
had
disappeared
then
shaking
his
head
as
if
to
dispel
the
cloud
which
darkened
his
brow
he
the
inn
and
asked
for
a
room
show
the
gentleman
to
number
three
said
the
landlord
to
a
chambermaid
the
chambermaid
took
a
key
hanging
from
a
large
black
wooden
tablet
on
which
were
arranged
the
numbers
in
white
in
two
rows
and
signed
to
the
young
traveller
to
follow
her
send
up
some
paper
and
a
pen
and
ink
roland
said
to
the
landlord
and
if
de
barjols
should
ask
where
i
am
tell
him
the
number
of
my
the
landlord
promised
to
obey
roland
s
injunctions
and
the
latter
followed
the
girl
upstairs
whistling
the
marseillaise
five
minutes
later
he
was
seated
at
a
table
with
the
desired
paper
pen
and
ink
before
him
preparing
to
write
but
just
as
he
was
beginning
the
first
line
some
one
knocked
three
times
at
the
door
come
in
said
he
twirling
his
chair
on
one
of
its
hind
legs
so
as
to
face
his
visitor
whom
he
supposed
to
be
either
de
barjols
or
one
of
his
friends
the
door
opened
with
a
steady
mechanical
motion
and
the
englishman
appeared
upon
the
threshold
ah
exclaimed
roland
enchanted
with
this
visit
in
view
of
his
general
s
recommendation
is
it
you
yes
said
the
englishman
it
is
you
are
oh
if
i
am
welcome
so
much
the
better
i
was
not
sure
that
i
ought
to
why
not
on
account
of
roland
began
to
laugh
there
are
two
battles
of
aboukir
said
he
one
which
we
lost
the
other
we
i
referred
to
the
one
you
good
said
roland
we
fight
kill
and
exterminate
each
other
on
the
battlefield
but
that
does
not
prevent
us
from
clasping
hands
on
neutral
ground
so
i
repeat
you
are
most
welcome
especially
if
you
will
tell
me
why
you
have
thank
you
but
in
the
first
place
read
and
the
englishman
drew
a
paper
from
his
pocket
what
is
that
asked
roland
my
what
have
i
to
do
with
your
passport
asked
roland
i
am
not
a
no
but
i
have
come
to
offer
you
my
services
perhaps
you
will
not
accept
them
if
you
do
not
know
who

but
read
that
roland
read
in
the
name
of
the
french
republic

executive
directory

that
sir
john
tanlay

permitted

read
it
yes
what
of
it
what
of
it
well
my
father
lord

is
why
barras
permits
me
to
roam
about

very
glad
to
roam
about
it
amuses
me
very
oh

was
trying
to
please
him
i
say
so
because
it
is
my
i
don
t
doubt
it
my
lord
said
roland
who
did
not
see
what
the
englishman
was
aiming
at
and
who
having
learned
all
that
he
wished
to
know
through
the
passport
held
himself
upon
his
guard
and
when
i
heard
continued
the
englishman
with
the
same
phlegm
you
defend
general
bonaparte
i
was
much
really
much
pleased
repeated
the
englishman
nodding
his
head
affirmatively
so
much
the
better
but
when
i
saw
you
throw
a
plate
at
alfred
de
barjols
head
i
was
much
you
were
grieved
my
lord
and
why
because
in
england
no
gentleman
would
throw
a
plate
at
the
head
of
another
my
lord
said
roland
rising
with
a
frown
have
you
perchance
come
here
to
read
me
a
lecture
oh
no
i
came
to
suggest
that
you
are
perhaps
perplexed
about
finding
a
second
my
faith
sir
john
i
admit
that
the
moment
when
you
knocked
at
the
door
i
was
wondering
of
whom
i
could
ask
this
of
me
if
you
wish
said
the
englishman
i
will
be
your
on
my
honor
exclaimed
roland
i
accept
with
all
my
that
is
the
service
i
wished
to
render
you
roland
held
out
his
hand
saying
thank
you
the
englishman
bowed
now
continued
roland
as
you
have
had
the
good
taste
my
lord
to
tell
me
who
you
were
before
offering
your
services
it
is
but
fair
that
since
i
accept
them
i
should
tell
you
who
i
oh
as
you
my
name
is
louis
de
montrevel
i
am
to
general
to
general
bonaparte
i
am
very
that
will
explain
why
i
undertook
rather
too
warmly
perhaps
my
general
s
no
not
too
warmly
only
the
plate
oh
i
know
well
that
the
provocation
did
not
entail
that
plate
but
what
would
you
have
me
do
i
held
it
in
my
hand
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
it
i
threw
it
at
de
barjols
head
it
went
of
itself
without
any
will
of
you
will
not
say
that
to
him
reassure
yourself
i
tell
you
to
salve
your
very
well
then
you
will
fight
that
is
why
i
have
remained
here
at
any
what
weapons
that
is
not
our
affair
my
what
not
our
affair
no
de
barjols
is
the
one
insulted
the
choice
is
then
you
will
accept
whatever
he
proposes
not
i
sir
john
but
you
in
my
name
since
you
do
me
the
honor
to
act
as
my
and
if
he
selects
pistols
what
is
the
distance
to
be
and
how
will
you
fight
that
is
your
affair
my
lord
and
not
mine
i
don
t
know
how
you
do
in
england
but
in
france
the
principals
take
no
part
in
the
arrangements
that
duty
devolves
upon
the
seconds
what
they
decide
is
well
decided
then
my
arrangements
will
be
satisfactory
perfectly
so
my
the
englishman
bowed
what
hour
and
what
day
oh
as
soon
as
possible
i
have
not
seen
my
family
for
two
years
and
i
confess
that
i
am
in
a
hurry
to
greet
the
englishman
looked
at
roland
with
a
certain
wonder
he
spoke
with
such
assurance
as
if
he
were
certain
that
he
would
not
be
killed
just
then
some
one
knocked
at
the
door
and
the
voice
of
the
innkeeper
asked
may
i
come
in
the
young
man
replied
affirmatively
the
door
opened
and
the
landlord
entered
holding
a
card
in
his
hand
which
he
handed
his
guest
the
young
man
took
the
card
and
read
charles
du
from
alfred
de
barjols
said
the
host
very
well
exclaimed
roland
then
handing
the
card
to
the
englishman
he
said
here
this
concerns
you
it
is
unnecessary
for
me
to
see
this
monsieur
since
we
are
no
longer
citizens
de
valensolle
is
de
barjols
second
you
are
mine
arrange
this
affair
between
you
only
added
the
young
man
pressing
the
englishman
s
hand
and
looking
fixedly
at
him
see
that
it
holds
a
chance
of
certain
death
for
one
of
us
otherwise
i
shall
complain
that
it
has
been
don
t
worry
said
the
englishman
i
will
act
for
you
as
for
excellent
go
now
and
when
everything
is
arranged
come
back
i
shall
not
stir
from
sir
john
followed
the
innkeeper
roland
reseated
himself
twirled
his
chair
back
to
its
former
position
facing
the
table
took
up
his
pen
and
began
to
write
when
sir
john
returned
roland
had
written
and
sealed
two
letters
and
was
addressing
a
third
he
signed
to
the
englishman
to
wait
until
he
had
finished
that
he
might
give
him
his
full
attention
then
the
address
finished
he
sealed
the
letter
and
turned
around
well
he
asked
is
everything
arranged
yes
said
the
englishman
it
was
an
easy
matter
you
are
dealing
with
a
true
so
much
the
better
exclaimed
roland
waiting
you
will
fight
two
hours
hence
by
the
fountain
of
vaucluse
a
charming
spot
with
pistols
advancing
to
each
other
each
to
fire
as
he
pleases
and
continuing
to
advance
after
his
adversary
s
by
my
faith
you
are
right
sir
john
that
is
indeed
excellent
did
you
arrange
that
i
and
de
barjols
second
your
adversary
having
renounced
his
rights
of
the
insulted
have
you
decided
upon
the
weapons
i
offered
my
pistols
they
were
accepted
on
my
word
of
honor
that
you
were
as
unfamiliar
with
them
as
was
de
barjols
they
are
excellent
weapons
i
can
cut
a
bullet
on
a
knife
blade
at
twenty
peste
you
are
a
good
shot
it
would
seem
my
yes
i
am
said
to
be
the
best
shot
in
that
is
a
good
thing
to
know
when
i
wish
to
be
killed
sir
john
i
ll
pick
a
quarrel
with
oh
don
t
pick
a
quarrel
with
me
said
the
englishman
it
would
grieve
me
too
much
to
have
to
fight
we
will
try
my
lord
not
to
cause
you
such
grief
so
it
is
settled
then
in
two
yes
you
told
me
you
were
in
a
precisely
how
far
is
it
to
this
charming
spot
from
here
to
vaucluse
twelve
a
matter
of
an
hour
and
a
half
we
have
no
time
to
lose
so
let
us
rid
ourselves
of
troublesome
things
in
order
to
have
nothing
but
pleasure
before
the
englishman
looked
at
the
young
man
in
astonishment
roland
did
not
seem
to
pay
any
attention
to
this
look
here
are
three
letters
said
he
one
for
madame
de
montrevel
my
mother
one
for
mlle
de
montrevel
my
sister
one
for
the
citizen
bonaparte
my
general
if
i
am
killed
you
will
simply
put
them
in
the
post
will
that
be
too
much
trouble
should
that
misfortune
occur
i
will
deliver
your
letters
myself
said
the
englishman
where
do
your
mother
and
sister
live
at
bourg
the
capital
of
the
department
of
that
is
near
here
observed
the
englishman
as
for
general
bonaparte
i
will
go
to
egypt
if
necessary
i
should
be
extremely
pleased
to
meet
general
if
you
take
the
trouble
as
you
say
my
lord
of
delivering
my
letters
yourself
you
will
not
have
to
travel
such
a
distance
within
three
days
general
bonaparte
will
be
in
oh
said
the
englishman
without
betraying
the
least
surprise
do
you
think
so
i
am
sure
of
it
replied
roland
truly
he
is
a
very
extraordinary
man
your
general
bonaparte
now
have
you
any
other
recommendations
to
make
to
me
de
montrevel
one
only
my
oh
as
many
as
you
no
thank
you
one
only
but
that
is
very
what
is
it
if
i
am
killed
but
i
doubt
if
i
be
so
sir
john
looked
at
roland
with
that
expression
of
wonder
which
he
had
already
awakened
three
or
four
times
if
i
am
killed
resumed
roland
for
after
all
one
must
be
prepared
for
everything
yes
if
you
are
killed
i
listen
well
my
lord
for
i
place
much
stress
on
my
directions
being
carried
out
exactly
in
this
every
detail
shall
be
observed
replied
sir
john
i
am
very
well
then
if
i
am
killed
insisted
roland
laying
his
hand
upon
his
second
s
shoulder
to
impress
his
directions
more
firmly
on
his
memory
you
must
not
permit
any
one
to
touch
my
body
which
is
to
be
placed
in
a
leaden
coffin
without
removing
the
garments
i
am
wearing
the
coffin
you
will
have
soldered
in
your
presence
then
inclosed
in
an
oaken
bier
which
must
also
be
nailed
up
in
your
presence
then
you
will
send
it
to
my
mother
unless
you
should
prefer
to
throw
it
into
the
rhone
which
i
leave
absolutely
to
your
discretion
provided
only
that
it
be
disposed
of
in
some
it
will
be
no
more
difficult
replied
the
englishman
to
take
the
coffin
since
i
am
to
deliver
your
decidedly
my
lord
said
roland
laughing
in
his
strange
way
you
are
a
capital
fellow
providence
in
person
brought
us
together
let
us
start
my
lord
let
us
start
they
left
roland
s
room
sir
john
s
chamber
was
on
the
same
floor
roland
waited
while
the
englishman
went
in
for
his
weapons
he
returned
a
few
seconds
later
carrying
the
box
in
his
hand
now
my
lord
asked
roland
how
shall
we
reach
vaucluse
on
horseback
or
by
carriage
by
carriage
if
you
are
willing
it
is
much
more
convenient
in
case
one
is
wounded
mine
is
waiting
i
thought
you
had
given
the
order
to
have
it
unharnessed
i
did
but
i
sent
for
the
postilion
afterward
and
countermanded
they
went
downstairs
tom
tom
called
sir
john
at
the
door
where
a
servant
in
the
severe
livery
of
an
english
groom
was
waiting
take
care
of
this
am
i
going
with
you
my
lord
asked
the
servant
yes
replied
sir
john
then
showing
roland
the
steps
of
his
carriage
which
the
servant
lowered
he
said
come
de
roland
entered
the
carriage
and
stretched
himself
out
luxuriously
upon
my
word
said
he
it
takes
you
english
to
understand
travelling
this
carriage
is
as
comfortable
as
a
bed
i
warrant
you
pad
your
coffins
before
you
are
put
in
them
yes
that
is
a
fact
said
sir
john
the
english
people
understand
comfort
but
the
french
people
are
much
more
curious
and
amusing
postilion
to
vaucluse
chapter
iv
the
duel
the
road
was
passable
only
from
avignon
to
l
isle
they
covered
the
nine
miles
between
the
two
places
in
an
hour
during
this
hour
roland
as
he
resolved
to
shorten
the
time
for
his
travelling
companion
was
witty
and
animated
and
their
approach
to
the
duelling
ground
only
served
to
redouble
his
gayety
to
one
unacquainted
with
the
object
of
this
drive
the
menace
of
dire
peril
impending
over
this
young
man
with
his
continuous
flow
of
conversation
and
incessant
laughter
would
have
seemed
incredible
at
the
village
of
l
isle
they
were
obliged
to
leave
the
carriage
finding
on
inquiry
that
they
were
the
first
to
arrive
they
entered
the
path
which
led
to
the
fountain
oh
oh
exclaimed
roland
there
ought
to
be
a
fine
echo
and
he
gave
one
or
two
cries
to
which
echo
replied
with
perfect
amiability
by
my
faith
said
the
young
man
this
is
a
marvellous
echo
i
know
none
save
that
of
the
seinonnetta
at
milan
which
can
compare
with
it
listen
my
and
he
began
with
modulations
which
revealed
an
admirable
voice
and
an
excellent
method
to
sing
a
tyrolean
song
which
seemed
to
bid
defiance
to
the
human
throat
with
its
rebellious
music
sir
john
watched
roland
and
listened
to
him
with
an
astonishment
which
he
no
longer
took
the
trouble
to
conceal
when
the
last
note
had
died
away
among
the
cavities
of
the
mountain
he
exclaimed
god
bless
me
but
i
think
your
liver
is
out
of
roland
started
and
looked
at
him
interrogatively
but
seeing
that
sir
john
did
not
intend
to
say
more
he
asked
good
what
makes
you
think
so
you
are
too
noisily
gay
not
to
be
profoundly
and
that
anomaly
astonishes
you
nothing
astonishes
me
because
i
know
that
it
has
always
its
reason
for
true
and
it
s
all
in
knowing
the
secret
well
i
m
going
to
enlighten
oh
i
don
t
want
to
force
you
re
too
polite
to
do
that
still
you
must
admit
you
would
be
glad
to
have
your
mind
set
at
rest
about
because
i
m
interested
in
well
sir
john
i
am
going
to
tell
you
the
secret
of
the
enigma
something
i
have
never
done
with
any
one
before
for
all
my
seeming
good
health
i
am
suffering
from
a
horrible
aneurism
that
causes
me
spasms
of
weakness
and
faintness
so
frequent
as
to
shame
even
a
woman
i
spend
my
life
taking
the
most
ridiculous
precautions
and
yet
larrey
warns
me
that
i
am
liable
to
die
any
moment
as
the
diseased
artery
in
my
breast
may
burst
at
the
least
exertion
judge
for
yourself
how
pleasant
for
a
soldier
you
can
understand
that
once
i
understood
my
condition
i
determined
incontinently
to
die
with
all
the
glory
possible
another
more
fortunate
than
i
would
have
succeeded
a
hundred
times
already
but
i
m
bewitched
i
am
impervious
alike
to
bullets
and
balls
even
the
swords
seem
to
fear
to
shatter
themselves
upon
my
skin
yet
i
never
miss
an
opportunity
that
you
must
see
after
what
occurred
at
dinner
well
we
are
going
to
fight
i
ll
expose
myself
like
a
maniac
giving
my
adversary
all
the
advantages
but
it
will
avail
me
nothing
though
he
shoot
at
fifteen
paces
or
even
ten
or
five
at
his
very
pistol
s
point
he
will
miss
me
or
his
pistol
will
miss
fire
and
all
this
wonderful
luck
that
some
fine
day
when
i
least
expect
it
i
may
die
pulling
on
my
boots
but
hush
i
here
comes
my
as
he
spoke
the
upper
half
of
three
people
could
be
seen
ascending
the
same
rough
and
rocky
path
that
roland
and
sir
john
had
followed
growing
larger
as
they
approached
roland
counted
them
three
he
exclaimed
why
three
when
we
are
only
two
ah
i
had
forgotten
replied
the
englishman
m
de
barjols
as
much
in
your
interest
as
in
his
own
asked
permission
to
bring
a
surgeon
one
of
his
what
for
harshly
demanded
roland
frowning
why
in
case
either
one
of
you
was
wounded
a
man
s
life
can
often
be
saved
by
bleeding
him
sir
john
exclaimed
roland
ferociously
i
don
t
understand
these
delicacies
in
the
matter
of
a
duel
when
men
fight
they
fight
to
kill
that
they
exchange
all
sorts
of
courtesies
beforehand
as
your
ancestors
did
at
fontenoy
is
all
right
but
once
the
swords
are
unsheathed
or
the
pistols
loaded
one
life
must
pay
for
the
trouble
they
have
taken
and
the
heart
beats
they
have
lost
i
ask
you
on
your
word
of
honor
sir
john
to
promise
that
wounded
or
dying
de
barjols
surgeon
shall
not
be
allowed
to
touch
but
suppose
roland
take
it
or
leave
it
your
word
of
honor
my
lord
or
devil
take
me
if
i
fight
at
the
englishman
again
looked
curiously
at
the
young
man
his
face
was
livid
and
his
limbs
quivered
as
though
in
extreme
terror
sir
john
without
understanding
this
strange
dread
passed
his
word
good
exclaimed
roland
this
you
see
is
one
of
the
effects
of
my
charming
malady
the
mere
thought
of
surgical
instruments
a
bistoury
or
a
lance
makes
me
dizzy
didn
t
i
grow
very
pale
i
did
think
for
an
instant
you
were
going
to
what
a
stunning
climax
exclaimed
roland
with
a
laugh
our
adversaries
arrive
and
you
are
dosing
me
with
smelling
salts
like
a
hysterical
woman
do
you
know
what
they
and
you
first
of
all
would
have
said
that
i
was
meantime
the
three
having
approached
within
earshot
sir
john
was
unable
to
answer
roland
they
bowed
and
roland
with
a
smile
that
revealed
his
beautiful
teeth
returned
their
greeting
sir
john
whispered
in
his
ear
you
are
still
a
trifle
pale
go
on
toward
the
fountain
i
will
fetch
you
when
we
are
ah
that
s
the
idea
said
roland
i
have
always
wanted
to
see
that
famous
fountain
of
vaucluse
the
hippocrene
of
petrarch
you
know
his
sonnet
chiari
fresche
e
dolci
acque
ove
le
belle
membra
pose
colei
che
sola
a
me
this
opportunity
lost
i
may
never
have
another
where
is
your
fountain
not
a
hundred
feet
off
follow
the
path
you
ll
find
it
at
the
turn
of
the
road
at
the
foot
of
that
enormous
bowlder
you
my
lord
said
roland
you
are
the
best
guide
i
know
thanks
and
with
a
friendly
wave
of
the
hand
he
went
off
in
the
direction
of
the
fountain
humming
the
charming
pastoral
of
philippe
desportes
beneath
his
breath
rosette
a
little
absence
has
turned
thine
heart
from
me
i
knowing
that
inconstance
have
turned
my
heart
from
thee
no
wayward
beauty
o
er
me
such
power
shall
obtain
we
ll
see
my
fickle
lassie
who
first
will
turn
sir
john
turned
as
he
heard
the
modulations
of
that
fresh
sweet
voice
whose
higher
notes
had
something
at
a
feminine
quality
his
cold
methodical
mind
understood
nothing
of
that
nervous
impulsive
nature
save
that
he
had
under
his
eyes
one
of
the
most
amazing
organisms
one
could
possibly
meet
the
other
two
young
men
were
waiting
for
him
the
surgeon
stood
a
little
apart
sir
john
carried
his
box
of
pistols
in
his
hands
laying
it
upon
a
rock
he
drew
a
little
key
from
his
pocket
apparently
fashioned
by
a
goldsmith
rather
than
a
locksmith
and
opened
the
box
the
weapons
were
magnificent
although
of
great
simplicity
they
came
from
manton
s
workshop
the
grandfather
of
the
man
who
is
still
considered
one
of
the
best
gunsmiths
in
london
he
handed
them
to
de
barjols
second
to
examine
the
latter
tried
the
triggers
and
played
with
the
lock
examining
to
see
if
they
were
they
were
de
barjols
cast
a
glance
at
them
but
did
not
even
touch
them
our
opponent
does
not
know
these
weapons
queried
valensolle
he
has
not
even
seen
them
replied
sir
john
i
give
you
my
word
of
oh
exclaimed
de
valensolle
a
simple
denial
the
conditions
of
the
duel
were
gone
over
a
second
time
to
avoid
possible
misunderstanding
then
these
conditions
determined
the
pistols
were
loaded
they
were
then
placed
loaded
in
the
box
the
box
left
in
the
surgeon
s
charge
and
sir
john
with
the
key
in
his
pocket
went
after
roland
he
found
him
chatting
with
a
little
shepherd
boy
who
was
herding
three
goats
on
the
steep
rocky
slope
of
the
mountain
and
throwing
pebbles
into
the
fountain
sir
john
opened
his
lips
to
tell
roland
that
all
was
ready
but
the
latter
without
giving
the
englishman
time
to
speak
exclaimed
you
don
t
know
what
this
child
has
been
telling
me
my
lord
a
perfect
legend
of
the
rhine
he
says
that
this
pool
whose
depth
is
unknown
extends
six
or
eight
miles
under
the
mountain
and
a
fairy
half
woman
half
serpent
dwells
here
calm
summer
nights
she
glides
over
the
surface
of
water
calling
to
the
shepherds
of
the
mountains
showing
them
of
course
nothing
more
than
her
head
with
its
long
locks
and
her
beautiful
bare
shoulders
and
arms
the
fools
caught
by
this
semblance
of
a
woman
draw
nearer
beckoning
to
her
to
come
to
them
while
she
on
her
side
signs
to
them
to
go
to
her
the
unwary
spirits
advance
unwittingly
giving
no
heed
to
their
steps
suddenly
the
earth
fails
them
the
fairy
reaches
out
her
arms
and
plunges
down
into
her
dripping
palaces
to
reappear
the
next
day
alone
where
the
devil
did
these
idiots
of
shepherds
get
the
tale
that
virgil
related
in
such
noble
verse
to
augustus
and
mecænas
he
remained
pensive
an
instant
his
eyes
bent
upon
the
azure
depths
then
turning
to
sir
john
they
say
that
no
matter
how
vigorous
the
swimmer
none
has
ever
returned
from
this
abyss
perhaps
were
i
to
try
it
my
lord
it
might
be
surer
than
de
barjols
bullet
however
it
always
remains
as
a
last
resort
in
the
meantime
let
us
try
the
bullet
come
my
lord
then
turning
to
the
englishman
who
listened
amazed
by
this
mobility
of
mind
he
led
him
back
to
the
others
who
awaited
them
they
in
the
meantime
had
found
a
suitable
place
it
was
a
little
plateau
perched
as
it
were
on
a
rocky
proclivity
jutting
from
the
mountain
side
exposed
to
the
setting
sun
on
which
stood
a
ruined
castle
where
the
shepherds
were
wont
to
seek
shelter
when
the
mistral
overtook
them
a
flat
space
some
hundred
and
fifty
feet
long
and
sixty
wide
which
might
once
have
been
the
castle
platform
was
now
to
be
the
scene
of
the
drama
which
was
fast
approaching
its
close
here
we
are
gentlemen
said
sir
john
we
are
ready
gentlemen
replied
de
valensolle
will
the
principals
kindly
listen
to
the
conditions
of
the
duel
said
sir
john
then
addressing
de
valensolle
he
added
repeat
them
monsieur
you
are
french
and
i
am
a
foreigner
you
will
explain
them
more
clearly
than
you
belong
to
those
foreigners
my
lord
who
teach
us
poor
provençals
the
purity
of
our
language
but
since
you
so
courteously
make
me
spokesman
i
obey
then
exchanging
bows
with
sir
john
he
continued
gentlemen
it
is
agreed
that
you
stand
at
forty
paces
that
you
advance
toward
each
other
that
each
will
fire
at
will
and
wounded
or
not
will
have
the
right
to
advance
after
your
adversary
s
the
two
combatants
bowed
in
sign
of
assent
and
with
one
voice
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
they
said
the
pistols
sir
john
drew
the
little
key
from
his
pocket
and
opened
the
box
then
approaching
de
barjols
he
offered
it
to
him
open
the
latter
wished
to
yield
the
choice
of
weapons
to
his
opponent
but
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
roland
refused
saying
in
a
tone
almost
feminine
in
its
sweetness
after
you
de
barjols
although
you
are
the
insulted
party
you
have
i
am
told
renounced
your
advantages
the
least
i
can
do
is
to
yield
you
this
one
if
for
that
matter
it
is
an
de
barjols
no
longer
insisted
he
took
one
of
the
two
pistols
at
random
sir
john
offered
the
other
to
roland
who
took
it
and
without
even
examining
its
mechanism
cocked
the
trigger
then
let
it
fall
at
arm
at
his
side
during
this
time
de
valensolle
had
measured
forty
paces
staking
a
cane
as
a
point
of
departure
will
you
measure
after
me
he
asked
sir
john
needless
sir
replied
the
latter
m
de
montrevel
and
myself
rely
entirely
upon
de
valensolle
staked
a
second
cane
at
the
fortieth
pace
gentlemen
said
he
when
you
are
roland
s
adversary
was
already
at
his
post
hat
and
cloak
removed
the
surgeon
and
the
two
seconds
stood
aside
the
spot
had
been
so
well
chosen
that
neither
had
any
advantage
of
sun
or
ground
roland
tossed
off
hat
and
coat
stationed
himself
forty
paces
from
de
barjols
facing
him
both
one
to
right
the
other
to
the
left
cast
a
glance
at
the
same
horizon
the
aspect
harmonized
with
the
terrible
solemnity
of
the
scene
about
to
take
place
nothing
was
visible
to
roland
s
right
and
to
de
barjols
left
except
the
mountain
s
swift
incline
and
gigantic
peak
but
on
the
other
side
that
is
to
say
to
de
barjols
right
and
roland
s
left
it
was
a
far
different
thing
the
horizon
stretched
illimitable
in
the
foreground
the
plain
its
ruddy
soil
pierced
on
all
sides
by
rocks
like
a
titan
graveyard
with
its
bones
protruding
through
the
earth
then
sharply
outlined
in
the
setting
sun
was
avignon
with
its
girdle
of
walls
and
its
vast
palace
like
a
crouching
lion
seeming
to
hold
the
panting
city
in
its
claws
beyond
avignon
a
luminous
sweep
like
a
river
of
molten
gold
defined
the
rhone
beyond
the
rhone
a
azure
vista
stretched
the
chain
of
hills
which
separate
avignon
from
nimes
and
d
uzes
and
far
off
the
sun
at
which
one
of
these
two
men
was
probably
looking
for
the
last
time
sank
slowly
and
majestically
in
an
ocean
of
gold
and
purple
for
the
rest
these
two
men
presented
a
singular
contrast
one
with
his
black
hair
swarthy
skin
slender
limbs
and
sombre
eyes
was
the
type
of
the
southern
race
which
counts
among
its
ancestors
greeks
romans
arabs
and
spaniards
the
other
with
his
rosy
skin
large
blue
eyes
and
hands
dimpled
like
a
woman
s
was
the
type
of
that
race
of
temperate
zones
which
reckons
gauls
germans
and
normans
among
its
forebears
had
one
wished
to
magnify
the
situation
it
were
easy
to
believe
this
something
greater
than
single
combat
between
two
men
one
might
have
thought
it
was
a
duel
of
a
people
against
another
people
race
against
race
the
south
against
the
north
was
it
these
thoughts
which
we
have
just
expressed
that
filled
roland
s
mind
and
plunged
him
into
that
melancholy
revery
probably
not
the
fact
is
for
an
instant
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
seconds
duel
adversary
lost
as
he
was
in
contemplation
of
this
magnificent
spectacle
de
barjols
voice
aroused
him
from
this
poetical
stupor
when
you
are
ready
sir
said
he
i
roland
started
pardon
my
keeping
you
waiting
sir
said
he
you
should
not
have
considered
me
i
am
so
i
am
ready
then
a
smile
on
his
lips
his
hair
lifted
by
the
evening
breeze
unconcerned
as
if
this
were
an
ordinary
promenade
while
his
opponent
on
the
contrary
took
all
the
precaution
usual
in
such
a
case
roland
advanced
straight
toward
de
barjols
sir
john
s
face
despite
his
ordinary
impassibility
betrayed
a
profound
anxiety
the
distance
between
the
opponents
lessened
rapidly
de
barjols
halted
first
took
aim
and
fired
when
roland
was
but
ten
paces
from
him
the
ball
clipped
one
of
roland
s
curls
but
did
not
touch
him
the
young
man
turned
toward
his
second
well
said
he
what
did
i
tell
you
fire
monsieur
fire
said
the
seconds
de
barjols
stood
silent
and
motionless
on
the
spot
where
he
had
fired
pardon
me
gentlemen
replied
roland
but
you
will
i
hope
permit
me
to
be
the
judge
of
the
time
and
manner
of
retaliating
since
i
have
felt
de
barjols
shot
i
have
a
few
words
to
say
to
him
which
i
could
not
say
then
turning
to
the
young
aristocrat
who
was
pale
and
calm
he
said
sir
perhaps
i
was
somewhat
too
hasty
in
our
discussion
this
and
he
waited
it
is
for
you
to
fire
sir
replied
de
barjols
but
continued
roland
as
if
he
had
not
heard
you
will
understand
my
impetuosity
and
perhaps
excuse
it
when
you
hear
that
i
am
a
soldier
and
general
bonaparte
s
fire
sir
replied
the
young
nobleman
say
but
one
word
of
retraction
sir
resumed
the
young
officer
say
that
general
bonaparte
s
reputation
for
honor
and
delicacy
is
such
that
a
miserable
italian
proverb
inspired
by
losers
can
not
reflect
discredit
on
him
say
that
and
i
throw
this
weapon
away
to
grasp
your
hand
for
i
recognize
in
you
sir
a
brave
i
can
not
accord
that
homage
to
his
honor
and
delicacy
until
your
general
has
devoted
the
influence
which
his
genius
gives
him
over
france
as
monk
did
that
is
to
say
to
reinstate
his
legitimate
sovereign
upon
the
ah
cried
roland
with
a
smile
that
is
asking
too
much
of
a
republican
then
i
maintain
what
i
said
replied
the
young
noble
fire
monsieur
fire
then
as
roland
made
no
haste
to
obey
this
injunction
he
shouted
stamping
his
foot
heavens
and
earth
will
you
fire
at
these
words
roland
made
a
movement
as
if
he
intended
to
fire
in
the
air
ah
exclaimed
de
barjols
then
with
a
rapidity
of
gesture
and
speech
that
prevented
this
do
not
fire
in
the
air
i
beg
or
i
shall
insist
that
we
begin
again
and
that
you
fire
on
my
honor
cried
roland
turning
as
pale
as
if
the
blood
had
left
his
body
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
done
so
much
for
any
man
go
to
the
devil
and
if
you
don
t
want
to
live
then
die
at
the
same
time
he
lowered
his
arm
and
fired
without
troubling
to
take
aim
alfred
de
barjols
put
his
hand
to
his
breast
swayed
back
and
forth
turned
around
and
fell
face
down
upon
the
ground
roland
s
bullet
had
gone
through
his
heart
sir
john
seeing
de
barjols
fall
went
straight
to
roland
and
drew
him
to
the
spot
where
he
had
thrown
his
hat
and
coat
that
is
the
third
murmured
roland
with
a
sigh
but
you
are
my
witness
that
this
one
would
have
then
giving
his
smoking
pistol
to
sir
john
he
resumed
his
hat
and
coat
during
this
time
de
valensolle
picked
up
the
pistol
which
had
escaped
from
his
friend
s
hand
and
brought
it
together
with
the
box
to
sir
john
well
asked
the
englishman
motioning
toward
alfred
de
barjols
with
his
eyes
he
is
dead
replied
the
second
have
i
acted
as
a
man
of
honor
sir
asked
roland
wiping
away
the
sweat
which
suddenly
inundated
his
brow
at
the
announcement
of
his
opponent
s
death
yes
monsieur
replied
de
valensolle
only
permit
me
to
say
this
you
possess
the
fatal
then
bowing
to
roland
and
his
second
with
exquisite
politeness
he
returned
to
his
friend
s
body
and
you
my
lord
resumed
roland
what
do
you
say
i
say
replied
sir
john
with
a
sort
of
forced
admiration
you
are
one
of
those
men
who
are
made
by
the
divine
shakespeare
to
say
of
themselves
danger
and
i
we
were
two
lions
littered
in
one
day
but
i
the
chapter
roland
the
return
was
silent
and
mournful
it
seemed
that
with
the
hopes
of
death
roland
s
gayety
had
disappeared
the
catastrophe
of
which
he
had
been
the
author
played
perhaps
a
part
in
his
taciturnity
but
let
us
hasten
to
say
that
in
battle
and
more
especially
during
the
last
campaign
against
the
arabs
roland
had
been
too
frequently
obliged
to
jump
his
horse
over
the
bodies
of
his
victims
to
be
so
deeply
impressed
by
the
death
of
an
unknown
man
his
sadness
was
due
to
some
other
cause
probably
that
which
he
confided
to
sir
john
disappointment
over
his
own
lost
chance
of
death
rather
than
that
other
s
decease
occasioned
this
regret
on
their
return
to
the
hotel
du
sir
john
mounted
to
his
room
with
his
pistols
the
sight
of
which
might
have
excited
something
like
remorse
in
roland
s
breast
then
he
rejoined
the
young
officer
and
returned
the
three
letters
which
had
been
intrusted
to
him
he
found
roland
leaning
pensively
on
a
table
without
saying
a
word
the
englishman
laid
the
three
letters
before
him
the
young
man
cast
his
eyes
over
the
addresses
took
the
one
destined
for
his
mother
unsealed
it
and
read
it
over
as
he
read
great
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
sir
john
gazed
wonderingly
at
this
new
phase
of
roland
s
character
he
had
thought
everything
possible
to
this
nature
except
those
tears
which
fell
silently
from
his
eyes
shaking
his
head
and
paying
not
the
least
attention
to
sir
john
s
presence
roland
murmured
poor
mother
she
would
have
wept
perhaps
it
is
better
so
mothers
were
not
made
to
weep
for
their
children
he
tore
up
the
letters
he
had
written
to
his
mother
his
sister
and
general
bonaparte
mechanically
burning
the
fragments
with
the
utmost
care
then
ringing
for
the
chambermaid
he
asked
when
must
my
letters
be
in
the
post
six
replied
she
you
have
only
a
few
minutes
just
wait
and
taking
a
pen
he
wrote
my
dear
general
it
is
as
i
told
you
i
am
living
and
he
is
dead
you
must
admit
that
this
seems
like
a
wager
devotion
to
death
your
paladin
roland
then
he
sealed
the
letter
addressed
it
to
general
bonaparte
rue
de
la
victoire
paris
and
handed
it
to
the
chambermaid
bidding
her
lose
no
time
in
posting
it
then
only
did
he
seem
to
notice
sir
john
and
held
out
his
hand
to
him
you
have
just
rendered
me
a
great
service
my
lord
he
said
one
of
those
services
which
bind
men
for
all
eternity
i
am
already
your
friend
will
you
do
me
the
honor
to
become
mine
sir
john
pressed
the
hand
that
roland
offered
him
oh
said
he
i
thank
you
heartily
i
should
never
have
dared
ask
this
honor
but
you
offer
it
and
i
even
the
impassible
englishman
felt
his
heart
soften
as
he
brushed
away
the
tear
that
trembled
on
his
lashes
then
looking
at
roland
he
said
it
is
unfortunate
that
you
are
so
hurried
i
should
have
been
pleased
and
delighted
to
spend
a
day
or
two
with
where
were
you
going
my
lord
when
i
met
you
oh
i
nowhere
i
am
travelling
to
get
over
being
bored
i
am
unfortunately
often
so
that
you
were
going
nowhere
i
was
going
that
is
exactly
the
same
thing
said
the
young
officer
smiling
well
will
you
do
something
for
me
oh
very
willingly
if
it
is
perfectly
possible
it
depends
only
on
what
is
it
had
i
been
killed
you
were
going
to
take
me
to
my
mother
or
throw
me
into
the
i
should
have
taken
you
to
your
mother
and
not
thrown
you
into
the
well
instead
of
accompanying
me
dead
take
me
living
you
will
be
all
the
better
oh
we
will
remain
a
fortnight
at
bourg
it
is
my
natal
city
and
one
of
the
dullest
towns
in
france
but
as
your
compatriots
are
for
originality
perhaps
you
will
find
amusement
where
others
are
bored
are
we
agreed
i
should
like
nothing
better
exclaimed
the
englishman
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
hardly
proper
on
my
oh
we
are
not
in
england
my
lord
where
etiquette
holds
absolute
sway
we
have
no
longer
king
nor
queen
we
didn
t
cut
off
that
poor
creature
s
head
whom
they
called
marie
antoinette
to
install
her
majesty
etiquette
in
her
i
should
like
to
go
said
sir
john
you
ll
see
my
mother
is
an
excellent
woman
and
very
distinguished
besides
my
sister
was
sixteen
when
i
left
she

be
eighteen
now
she
was
pretty
and
she
ought
to
be
beautiful
then
there
is
my
brother
edouard
a
delightful
youngster
of
twelve
who
will
let
off
fireworks
between
your
legs
and
chatter
a
gibberish
of
english
with
you
at
the
end
of
the
fortnight
we
will
go
to
paris
i
have
just
come
from
paris
said
the
englishman
but
listen
you
were
willing
to
go
to
egypt
to
see
general
bonaparte
paris
is
not
so
far
from
here
as
cairo
i
ll
present
you
and
introduced
by
me
you
may
rest
assured
that
you
will
be
well
received
you
were
speaking
of
shakespeare
just
now
oh
i
am
always
quoting
which
proves
that
you
like
comedies
and
i
do
like
them
very
much
that
s
well
then
general
bonaparte
is
going
to
produce
one
in
his
own
style
which
will
not
be
wanting
in
interest
i
answer
for
it
so
that
said
sir
john
still
hesitating
i
may
accept
your
offer
without
seeming
intrusive
i
should
think
so
you
will
delight
us
all
especially
then
i
bravo
now
let
s
see
when
will
you
start
as
soon
as
you
wish
my
coach
was
harnessed
when
you
threw
that
unfortunate
plate
at
barjols
head
however
as
i
should
never
have
known
you
but
for
that
plate
i
am
glad
you
did
throw
it
at
him
shall
we
start
this
evening
instantly
i
ll
give
orders
for
the
postilion
to
send
other
horses
and
once
they
are
here
we
will
roland
nodded
acquiescence
sir
john
went
out
to
give
his
orders
and
returned
presently
saying
they
had
served
two
cutlets
and
a
cold
fowl
for
them
below
roland
took
his
valise
and
went
down
the
englishman
placed
his
pistols
in
the
coach
box
again
both
ate
enough
to
enable
them
to
travel
all
night
and
as
nine
o
clock
was
striking
from
the
church
of
the
cordeliers
they
settled
themselves
in
the
carriage
and
quitted
avignon
where
their
passage
left
a
fresh
trail
of
blood
roland
with
the
careless
indifference
of
his
nature
sir
john
tanlay
with
the
impassibility
of
his
nation
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
both
were
sleeping
or
at
least
the
silence
which
obtained
induced
the
belief
that
both
had
yielded
to
slumber
we
shall
profit
by
this
instant
of
repose
to
give
our
readers
some
indispensable
information
concerning
roland
and
his
family
roland
was
born
the
first
of
july
four
years
and
a
few
days
later
than
bonaparte
at
whose
side
or
rather
following
him
he
made
his
appearance
in
this
book
he
was
the
son
of
charles
de
montrevel
colonel
of
a
regiment
long
garrisoned
at
martinique
where
he
had
married
a
creole
named
clotilde
de
la
clémencière
three
children
were
born
of
this
marriage
two
boys
and
a
girl
louis
whose
acquaintance
we
have
made
under
the
name
of
roland
amélie
whose
beauty
he
had
praised
to
sir
john
and
edouard
recalled
to
france
in
de
montrevel
obtained
admission
for
young
louis
de
montrevel
we
shall
see
later
how
the
name
of
louis
was
changed
to
roland
to
the
ecole
militaire
in
paris
it
was
there
that
bonaparte
knew
the
child
when
on
de
keralio
s
report
he
was
judged
worthy
of
promotion
from
the
ecole
de
brienne
to
the
ecole
militaire
louis
was
the
youngest
pupil
though
he
was
only
thirteen
he
had
already
made
himself
remarked
for
that
ungovernable
and
quarrelsome
nature
of
which
we
have
seen
him
seventeen
years
later
give
an
example
at
the
table
d
hôte
at
avignon
bonaparte
a
child
himself
had
the
good
side
of
this
character
that
is
to
say
without
being
quarrelsome
he
was
firm
obstinate
and
unconquerable
he
recognized
in
the
child
some
of
his
own
qualities
and
this
similarity
of
sentiments
led
him
to
pardon
the
boy
s
defects
and
attached
him
to
him
on
the
other
hand
the
child
conscious
of
a
supporter
in
the
corsican
relied
upon
him
one
day
the
child
went
to
find
his
great
friend
as
he
called
napoleon
when
the
latter
was
absorbed
in
the
solution
of
a
mathematical
problem
he
knew
the
importance
the
future
artillery
officer
attached
to
this
science
which
so
far
had
won
him
his
greatest
or
rather
his
only
successes
he
stood
beside
him
without
speaking
or
moving
the
young
mathematician
felt
the
child
s
presence
and
plunged
deeper
and
deeper
into
his
mathematical
calculations
whence
he
emerged
victorious
ten
minutes
later
then
he
turned
to
his
young
comrade
with
that
inward
satisfaction
of
a
man
who
issues
victorious
from
any
struggle
be
it
with
science
or
things
material
the
child
stood
erect
pale
his
teeth
clinched
his
arms
rigid
and
his
fists
closed
oh
oh
said
young
bonaparte
what
is
the
matter
now
valence
the
governor
s
nephew
struck
ah
said
bonaparte
laughing
and
you
have
come
to
me
to
strike
him
back
the
child
shook
his
head
no
said
he
i
have
come
to
you
because
i
want
to
fight
him
fight
valence
but
valence
will
beat
you
child
he
is
four
times
as
strong
as
therefore
i
don
t
want
to
fight
him
as
children
do
but
like
men
pooh
does
that
surprise
you
asked
the
child
no
said
bonaparte
what
do
you
want
to
fight
with
with
but
only
the
sergeants
have
swords
and
they
won
t
lend
you
then
we
will
do
without
but
what
will
you
fight
with
the
child
pointed
to
the
compass
with
which
the
young
mathematician
had
made
his
equations
oh
my
child
said
bonaparte
a
compass
makes
a
very
bad
so
much
the
better
replied
louis
i
can
kill
but
suppose
he
kills
you
i
d
rather
that
than
bear
his
bonaparte
made
no
further
objections
he
loved
courage
instinctively
and
his
young
comrade
s
pleased
him
well
so
be
it
he
replied
i
will
tell
valence
that
you
wish
to
fight
him
but
not
till
why
you
will
have
the
night
to
and
from
now
till
replied
the
child
valence
will
think
me
a
then
shaking
his
head
it
is
too
long
till
and
he
walked
away
where
are
you
going
bonaparte
asked
him
to
ask
some
one
else
to
be
my
so
i
am
no
longer
your
friend
no
since
you
think
i
am
a
very
well
said
the
young
man
rising
you
will
go
i
am
at
once
at
ah
exclaimed
the
child
i
beg
your
pardon
you
are
indeed
my
and
he
fell
upon
his
neck
weeping
they
were
the
first
tears
he
had
shed
since
he
had
received
the
blow
bonaparte
went
in
search
of
valence
and
gravely
explained
his
mission
to
him
valence
was
a
tall
lad
of
seventeen
having
already
like
certain
precocious
natures
a
beard
and
mustache
he
appeared
at
least
twenty
he
was
moreover
a
head
taller
than
the
boy
he
had
insulted
valence
replied
that
louis
had
pulled
his
queue
as
if
it
were
a
queues
were
then
in
vogue
that
he
had
warned
him
twice
to
desist
but
that
louis
had
repeated
the
prank
the
third
time
whereupon
considering
him
a
mischievous
youngster
he
had
treated
him
as
such
valence
s
answer
was
reported
to
louis
who
retorted
that
pulling
a
comrade
s
queue
was
only
teasing
him
whereas
a
blow
was
an
insult
obstinacy
endowed
this
child
of
thirteen
with
the
logic
of
a
man
of
thirty
the
modern
popilius
to
valence
returned
with
his
declaration
of
war
the
youth
was
greatly
embarrassed
he
could
not
fight
with
a
child
without
being
ridiculous
if
he
fought
and
wounded
him
it
would
be
a
horrible
thing
if
he
himself
were
wounded
he
would
never
get
over
it
so
long
as
he
lived
but
louis
s
unyielding
obstinacy
made
the
matter
a
serious
one
a
council
of
the
grands
elder
scholars
was
called
as
was
usual
in
serious
cases
the
grands
decided
that
one
of
their
number
could
not
fight
a
child
but
since
this
child
persisted
in
considering
himself
a
young
man
valence
must
tell
him
before
all
his
schoolmates
that
he
regretted
having
treated
him
as
a
child
and
would
henceforth
regard
him
as
a
young
man
louis
who
was
waiting
in
his
friend
s
room
was
sent
for
he
was
introduced
into
the
conclave
assembled
in
the
playground
of
the
younger
pupils
there
valence
to
whom
his
comrades
had
dictated
a
speech
carefully
debated
among
themselves
to
safeguard
the
honor
of
the
grands
toward
the
petits
assured
louis
that
he
deeply
deplored
the
occurrence
that
he
had
treated
him
according
to
his
age
and
not
according
to
his
intelligence
and
courage
and
begged
him
to
excuse
his
impatience
and
to
shake
hands
in
sign
that
all
was
forgotten
but
louis
shook
his
head
i
heard
my
father
who
is
a
colonel
say
once
he
replied
that
he
who
receives
a
blow
and
does
not
fight
is
a
coward
the
first
time
i
see
my
father
i
shall
ask
him
if
he
who
strikes
the
blow
and
then
apologizes
to
avoid
fighting
is
not
more
of
a
coward
than
he
who
received
the
young
fellows
looked
at
each
other
still
the
general
opinion
was
against
a
duel
which
would
resemble
murder
and
all
bonaparte
included
were
unanimously
agreed
that
the
child
must
be
satisfied
with
what
valence
had
said
for
it
represented
their
common
opinion
louis
retired
pale
with
anger
and
sulked
with
his
great
friend
who
said
he
with
imperturbable
gravity
had
sacrificed
his
honor
the
morrow
while
the
grands
were
receiving
their
lesson
in
mathematics
louis
slipped
into
the
and
while
valence
was
making
a
demonstration
on
the
blackboard
he
approached
him
unperceived
climbed
on
a
stool
to
reach
his
face
and
returned
the
slap
he
had
received
the
preceding
day
there
said
he
now
we
are
quits
and
i
have
your
apologies
to
boot
as
for
me
i
shan
t
make
any
you
may
be
quite
sure
of
the
scandal
was
great
the
act
occurring
in
the
professor
s
presence
he
was
obliged
to
report
it
to
the
governor
of
the
school
the
marquis
tiburce
valence
the
latter
knowing
nothing
of
the
events
leading
up
to
the
blow
his
nephew
had
received
sent
for
the
delinquent
and
after
a
terrible
lecture
informed
him
that
he
was
no
longer
a
member
of
the
school
and
must
be
ready
to
return
to
his
mother
at
bourg
that
very
day
louis
replied
that
his
things
would
be
packed
in
ten
minutes
and
he
out
of
the
school
in
fifteen
of
the
blow
he
himself
had
received
he
said
not
a
word
the
reply
seemed
more
than
disrespectful
to
the
marquis
tiburce
valence
he
was
much
inclined
to
send
the
insolent
boy
to
the
dungeon
for
a
week
but
reflected
that
he
could
not
confine
him
and
expel
him
at
the
same
time
the
child
was
placed
in
charge
of
an
attendant
who
was
not
to
leave
him
until
he
had
put
him
in
the
coach
for
mâcon
madame
de
montrevel
was
to
be
notified
to
meet
him
at
the
end
of
the
journey
bonaparte
meeting
the
boy
followed
by
his
keeper
asked
an
explanation
of
the
sort
of
constabulary
guard
attached
to
him
i
d
tell
you
if
you
were
still
my
friend
replied
the
child
but
you
are
not
why
do
you
bother
about
what
happens
to
me
whether
good
or
bad
bonaparte
made
a
sign
to
the
attendant
who
came
to
the
door
while
louis
was
packing
his
little
trunk
he
learned
then
that
the
child
had
been
expelled
the
step
was
serious
it
would
distress
the
entire
family
and
perhaps
ruin
his
young
comrade
s
future
with
that
rapidity
of
decision
which
was
one
of
the
distinctive
characteristics
of
his
organization
he
resolved
to
ask
an
audience
of
the
governor
meantime
requesting
the
keeper
not
to
hasten
louis
s
departure
bonaparte
was
an
excellent
pupil
beloved
in
the
school
and
highly
esteemed
by
the
marquis
tiburce
valence
his
request
was
immediately
complied
with
ushered
into
the
governor
s
presence
he
related
everything
and
without
blaming
valence
in
the
least
he
sought
to
exculpate
louis
are
you
sure
of
what
you
are
telling
me
sir
asked
the
governor
question
your
nephew
himself
i
will
abide
by
what
he
valence
was
sent
for
he
had
already
heard
of
louis
s
expulsion
and
was
on
his
way
to
tell
his
uncle
what
had
happened
his
account
tallied
perfectly
with
what
you
bonaparte
had
said
very
well
said
the
governor
louis
shall
not
go
but
you
will
you
are
old
enough
to
leave
then
ringing
bring
me
the
list
of
the
vacant
he
said
that
same
day
an
urgent
request
for
a
was
made
to
the
ministry
and
that
same
night
valence
left
to
join
his
regiment
he
went
to
bid
louis
farewell
embracing
him
half
willingly
half
unwillingly
while
bonaparte
held
his
hand
the
child
received
the
embrace
reluctantly
it
s
all
right
now
said
he
but
if
ever
we
meet
with
swords
by
our
sides
a
threatening
gesture
ended
the
sentence
valence
left
bonaparte
received
his
own
appointment
as
october
his
was
one
of
commissions
which
louis
xvi
signed
for
the
ecole
militaire
eleven
years
later
november
bonaparte
of
the
army
of
italy
at
the
bridge
of
arcola
which
was
defended
by
two
regiments
of
croats
and
two
pieces
of
cannon
seeing
his
ranks
disseminated
by
grapeshot
and
musket
balls
feeling
that
victory
was
slipping
through
his
fingers
alarmed
by
the
hesitation
of
his
bravest
followers
wrenched
the
from
the
rigid
fingers
of
a
dead
and
dashed
toward
the
bridge
shouting
soldiers
are
you
no
longer
the
men
of
lodi
as
he
did
so
he
saw
a
young
lieutenant
spring
past
him
who
covered
him
with
his
body
this
was
far
from
what
bonaparte
wanted
he
wished
to
cross
first
had
it
been
possible
he
would
have
gone
alone
seizing
the
young
man
by
the
flap
of
his
coat
he
drew
him
back
saying
citizen
you
are
only
a
lieutenant
i
a
the
precedence
belongs
to
too
true
replied
the
other
and
he
followed
bonaparte
instead
of
preceding
him
that
evening
learning
that
two
austrian
divisions
had
been
cut
to
pieces
and
seeing
the
two
thousand
prisoners
he
had
taken
together
with
the
captured
cannons
and
flags
bonaparte
recalled
the
young
man
who
had
sprung
in
front
of
him
when
death
alone
seemed
before
him
berthier
said
he
tell
my
valence
to
find
that
young
lieutenant
of
grenadiers
with
whom
i
had
a
controversy
this
morning
at
the
bridge
of
general
stammered
berthier
valence
is
ah
i
remember
i
have
not
seen
him
wounded
where
how
on
the
battlefield
no
general
said
he
he
was
dragged
into
a
quarrel
yesterday
and
received
a
sword
thrust
through
his
bonaparte
frowned
and
yet
they
know
very
well
i
do
not
approve
of
duels
a
soldier
s
blood
belongs
not
to
himself
but
to
france
give
muiron
the
order
he
is
killed
to
elliot
in
that
killed
bonaparte
drew
his
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
and
passed
it
over
his
brow
which
was
bathed
with
sweat
to
whom
you
will
then
but
i
want
to
see
that
he
dared
not
name
any
others
fearing
to
hear
again
that
fatal
killed
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
young
lieutenant
was
ushered
into
his
tent
which
was
lighted
faintly
by
a
single
lamp
come
nearer
lieutenant
said
bonaparte
the
young
man
made
three
steps
and
came
within
the
circle
of
light
so
you
are
the
man
who
wished
to
cross
the
bridge
before
me
continued
bonaparte
it
was
done
on
a
wager
general
gayly
answered
the
young
lieutenant
whose
voice
made
the
general
start
did
i
make
you
lose
it
maybe
yes
maybe
what
was
the
wager
that
i
should
be
promoted
captain
you
have
won
thank
you
the
young
man
moved
hastily
forward
as
if
to
press
bonaparte
s
hand
but
checked
himself
almost
immediately
the
light
had
fallen
full
on
his
face
for
an
instant
that
instant
sufficed
to
make
the
general
notice
the
face
as
he
had
the
voice
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
was
unknown
to
him
he
searched
his
memory
for
an
instant
but
finding
it
rebellious
said
i
know
you
possibly
i
am
certain
only
i
can
not
recall
your
you
managed
that
yours
should
not
be
forgotten
who
are
you
ask
valence
bonaparte
gave
a
cry
of
joy
louis
de
montrevel
he
exclaimed
opening
wide
his
arms
this
time
the
young
lieutenant
did
not
hesitate
to
fling
himself
into
them
very
good
said
bonaparte
you
will
serve
eight
days
with
the
regiment
in
your
new
rank
that
they
may
accustom
themselves
to
your
captain
s
epaulets
and
then
you
will
take
my
poor
muiron
s
place
as
go
once
more
cried
the
young
man
opening
his
arms
faith
yes
said
bonaparte
joyfully
then
holding
him
close
after
kissing
him
twice
and
so
it
was
you
who
gave
valence
that
sword
thrust
my
word
said
the
new
captain
and
future
you
were
there
when
i
promised
it
to
him
a
soldier
keeps
his
eight
days
later
captain
montrevel
was
doing
duty
as
to
the
who
changed
his
name
of
louis
then
in
to
that
of
roland
and
the
young
man
consoled
himself
for
ceasing
to
be
a
descendant
of
louis
by
becoming
the
nephew
of
charlemagne
roland
no
one
would
have
dared
to
call
captain
montrevel
louis
after
bonaparte
had
baptized
him
roland
made
the
campaign
of
italy
with
his
general
and
returned
with
him
to
paris
after
the
peace
of
campo
formio
when
the
egyptian
expedition
was
decided
upon
roland
who
had
been
summoned
to
his
mother
s
side
by
the
death
of
the
de
montrevel
killed
on
the
rhine
while
his
son
was
fighting
on
the
adige
and
the
mincio
was
among
the
first
appointed
by
the
to
accompany
him
in
the
useless
but
poetical
crusade
which
he
was
planning
he
left
his
mother
his
sister
amélie
and
his
young
brother
edouard
at
bourg
general
de
montrevel
s
native
town
they
resided
some
of
a
mile
out
of
the
city
at
a
charming
house
called
a
château
which
together
with
the
farm
and
several
hundred
acres
of
land
surrounding
it
yielded
an
income
of
six
or
eight
thousand
livres
a
year
and
constituted
the
general
s
entire
fortune
roland
s
departure
on
this
adventurous
expedition
deeply
afflicted
the
poor
widow
the
death
of
the
father
seemed
to
presage
that
of
the
son
and
madame
de
montrevel
a
sweet
gentle
creole
was
far
from
possessing
the
stern
virtues
of
a
spartan
or
lacedemonian
mother
bonaparte
who
loved
his
old
comrade
of
the
ecole
militaire
with
all
his
heart
granted
him
permission
to
rejoin
him
at
the
very
last
moment
at
toulon
but
the
fear
of
arriving
too
late
prevented
roland
from
profiting
by
this
permission
to
its
full
extent
he
left
his
mother
promising
her
a
promise
he
was
careful
not
to
keep
that
he
would
not
expose
himself
unnecessarily
and
arrived
at
marseilles
eight
days
before
the
fleet
set
sail
our
intention
is
no
more
to
give
the
history
of
the
campaign
of
egypt
than
we
did
that
of
italy
we
shall
only
mention
that
which
is
absolutely
necessary
to
understand
this
story
and
the
subsequent
development
of
roland
s
character
the
of
may
bonaparte
and
his
entire
staff
set
sail
for
the
orient
the
of
june
the
knights
of
malta
gave
up
the
keys
of
their
citadel
the
of
july
the
army
disembarked
at
marabout
and
the
same
day
took
alexandria
the
bonaparte
entered
cairo
after
defeating
the
mamelukes
at
chebreïss
and
the
pyramids
during
this
succession
of
marches
and
battles
roland
had
been
the
officer
we
know
him
gay
courageous
and
witty
defying
the
scorching
heat
of
the
day
the
icy
dew
of
the
nights
dashing
like
a
hero
or
a
fool
among
the
turkish
sabres
or
the
bedouin
bullets
during
the
forty
days
of
the
voyage
he
had
never
left
the
interpreter
ventura
so
that
with
his
admirable
facility
he
had
learned
if
not
to
speak
arabic
fluently
at
least
to
make
himself
understood
in
that
language
therefore
it
often
happened
that
when
the
general
did
not
wish
to
use
the
native
interpreter
roland
was
charged
with
certain
communications
to
the
muftis
the
ulemas
and
the
sheiks
during
the
night
of
october
and
cairo
revolted
at
five
in
the
morning
the
death
of
general
dupey
killed
by
a
lance
was
made
known
at
eight
just
as
the
revolt
was
supposedly
quelled
an
of
the
dead
general
rode
up
announcing
that
the
bedouins
from
the
plains
were
attacking
or
the
gate
of
victory
bonaparte
was
breakfasting
with
his
sulkowsky
so
severely
wounded
at
salahieh
that
he
left
his
pallet
of
suffering
with
the
greatest
difficulty
only
bonaparte
in
his
preoccupation
forgetting
the
young
pole
s
condition
said
to
him
sulkowsky
take
fifteen
guides
and
go
see
what
that
rabble
sulkowsky
rose
general
interposed
roland
give
me
the
commission
don
t
you
see
my
comrade
can
hardly
stand
true
said
bonaparte
do
you
go
roland
went
out
and
took
the
fifteen
guides
and
started
but
the
order
had
been
given
to
sulkowsky
and
sulkowsky
was
determined
to
execute
it
he
set
forth
with
five
or
six
men
whom
he
found
ready
whether
by
chance
or
because
he
knew
the
streets
of
cairo
better
than
roland
he
reached
the
gate
of
victory
a
few
seconds
before
him
when
roland
arrived
he
saw
five
or
six
dead
men
and
an
officer
being
led
away
by
the
arabs
who
while
massacring
the
soldiers
mercilessly
will
sometimes
spare
the
officers
in
hope
of
a
ransom
roland
recognized
sulkowsky
pointing
him
out
with
his
sabre
to
his
fifteen
men
he
charged
at
a
gallop
half
an
hour
later
a
guide
returning
alone
to
announced
the
deaths
of
sulkowsky
roland
and
his
companions
bonaparte
as
we
have
said
loved
roland
as
a
brother
as
a
son
as
he
loved
eugene
he
wished
to
know
all
the
details
of
the
catastrophe
and
questioned
the
guide
the
man
had
seen
an
arab
cut
off
sulkowsky
s
head
and
fasten
it
to
his
as
for
roland
his
horse
had
been
killed
he
had
disengaged
himself
from
the
stirrups
and
was
seen
fighting
for
a
moment
on
foot
but
he
had
soon
disappeared
in
a
general
volley
at
close
quarters
bonaparte
sighed
shed
a
tear
and
murmured
another
and
apparently
thought
no
more
about
it
but
he
did
inquire
to
what
tribe
belonged
these
bedouins
who
had
just
killed
two
of
the
men
he
loved
best
he
was
told
that
they
were
an
independent
tribe
whose
village
was
situated
some
thirty
miles
off
bonaparte
left
them
a
month
that
they
might
become
convinced
of
their
impunity
then
the
month
elapsed
he
ordered
one
of
his
named
crosier
to
surround
the
village
destroy
the
huts
behead
the
men
put
them
in
sacks
and
bring
the
rest
of
the
population
that
is
to
say
the
women
and
children
to
cairo
crosier
executed
the
order
punctually
all
the
women
and
children
who
could
be
captured
were
brought
to
cairo
and
also
with
them
one
living
arab
gagged
and
bound
to
his
horse
s
back
why
is
this
man
still
alive
asked
bonaparte
i
ordered
you
to
behead
every
man
who
was
able
to
bear
general
said
crosier
who
also
possessed
a
smattering
of
arabian
words
just
as
i
was
about
to
order
his
head
cut
off
i
understood
him
to
offer
to
exchange
a
prisoner
for
his
life
i
thought
there
would
be
time
enough
to
cut
off
his
head
and
so
brought
him
with
me
if
i
am
mistaken
the
ceremony
can
take
place
here
as
well
as
there
what
is
postponed
is
not
the
interpreter
ventura
was
summoned
to
question
the
bedouin
he
replied
that
he
had
saved
the
life
of
a
french
officer
who
had
been
grievously
wounded
at
the
gate
of
victory
and
that
this
officer
who
spoke
a
little
arabic
claimed
to
be
one
of
general
bonaparte
s
he
had
sent
him
to
his
brother
who
was
a
physician
in
a
neighboring
tribe
of
which
this
officer
was
a
captive
and
if
they
would
promise
to
spare
his
life
he
would
write
to
his
brother
to
send
the
prisoner
to
cairo
perhaps
this
was
a
tale
invented
to
gain
time
but
it
might
also
be
true
nothing
was
lost
by
waiting
the
arab
was
placed
in
safe
keeping
a
scribe
was
brought
to
write
at
his
dictation
he
sealed
the
letter
with
his
own
seal
and
an
arab
from
cairo
was
despatched
to
negotiate
the
exchange
if
the
emissary
succeeded
it
meant
the
bedouin
s
life
and
five
hundred
piastres
to
the
messenger
three
days
later
he
returned
bringing
roland
bonaparte
had
hoped
for
but
had
not
dared
to
expect
this
return
this
heart
of
iron
which
had
seemed
insensible
to
grief
was
now
melted
with
joy
he
opened
his
arms
to
roland
as
on
the
day
when
he
had
found
him
and
two
tears
two
pearls
the
tears
of
bonaparte
were
rare
fell
from
his
eyes
but
roland
strange
as
it
may
seem
was
sombre
in
the
midst
of
the
joy
caused
by
his
return
he
confirmed
the
arab
s
tale
insisted
upon
his
liberation
but
refused
all
personal
details
about
his
capture
by
the
bedouins
and
the
treatment
he
had
received
at
the
hands
of
the
doctor
as
for
sulkowsky
he
had
been
killed
and
beheaded
before
his
eyes
so
it
was
useless
to
think
more
of
him
roland
resumed
his
duties
but
it
was
noticeable
his
native
courage
had
become
temerity
and
his
longing
for
glory
desire
for
death
on
the
other
hand
as
often
happens
with
those
who
brave
fire
and
sword
fire
and
sword
miraculously
spared
him
before
behind
and
around
roland
men
fell
he
remained
erect
invulnerable
as
the
demon
of
war
during
the
campaign
in
syria
two
emissaries
were
sent
to
demand
the
surrender
of
saint
jean
d
acre
of
djezzar
pasha
neither
of
the
two
returned
they
had
been
beheaded
it
was
necessary
to
send
a
third
roland
applied
for
the
duty
and
so
insistent
was
he
that
he
eventually
obtained
the
general
s
permission
and
returned
in
safety
he
took
part
in
each
of
the
nineteen
assaults
made
upon
the
fortress
at
each
assault
he
was
seen
entering
the
breach
he
was
one
of
the
ten
men
who
forced
their
way
into
the
accursèd
tower
nine
remained
but
he
returned
without
a
scratch
during
the
retreat
bonaparte
commanded
his
cavalry
to
lend
their
horses
to
the
wounded
and
sick
all
endeavored
to
avoid
the
contagion
of
the
sick
to
them
roland
gave
his
horse
from
preference
three
fell
dead
from
the
saddle
he
mounted
his
horse
after
them
and
reached
cairo
safe
and
sound
at
aboukir
he
flung
himself
into
the
mélée
reached
the
pasha
by
forcing
his
way
through
the
guard
of
blacks
who
surrounded
him
seized
him
by
the
beard
and
received
the
fire
of
his
two
pistols
one
burned
the
wadding
only
the
other
ball
passed
under
his
arm
killing
a
guard
behind
him
when
bonaparte
resolved
to
return
to
france
roland
was
the
first
to
whom
the
general
announced
his
intention
another
had
been
overjoyed
but
he
remained
sombre
and
melancholy
saying
i
should
prefer
to
remain
here
general
there
is
more
chance
of
my
being
killed
but
as
it
would
have
appeared
ungrateful
on
his
part
to
refuse
to
follow
the
general
he
returned
with
him
during
the
voyage
he
remained
sad
and
impenetrable
until
the
english
fleet
was
sighted
near
corsica
then
only
did
he
regain
his
wonted
animation
bonaparte
told
admiral
gantheaume
that
he
would
fight
to
the
death
and
gave
orders
to
sink
the
frigate
sooner
than
haul
down
the
flag
he
passed
however
unseen
through
the
british
fleet
and
disembarked
at
frejus
october
all
were
impatient
to
be
the
first
to
set
foot
on
french
soil
roland
was
the
last
although
the
general
paid
no
apparent
attention
to
these
details
none
escaped
him
he
sent
eugène
berthier
bourrienne
his
and
his
suite
by
way
of
gap
and
draguignan
while
he
took
the
road
to
aix
strictly
incognito
accompanied
only
by
roland
to
judge
for
himself
of
the
state
of
the
midi
hoping
that
the
joy
of
seeing
his
family
again
would
revive
the
love
of
life
in
his
heart
crushed
by
its
hidden
sorrow
he
informed
roland
at
aix
that
they
would
part
at
lyons
and
gave
him
three
weeks
furlough
to
visit
his
mother
and
sister
roland
replied
thank
you
general
my
sister
and
my
mother
will
be
very
happy
to
see
whereas
formerly
his
words
would
have
been
thank
you
general
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
see
my
mother
and
sister
we
know
what
occurred
at
avignon
we
have
seen
with
what
profound
contempt
for
danger
bitter
disgust
of
life
roland
had
provoked
that
terrible
duel
we
heard
the
reason
he
gave
sir
john
for
this
indifference
to
death
was
it
true
or
false
sir
john
at
all
events
was
obliged
to
content
himself
with
it
since
roland
was
evidently
not
disposed
to
furnish
any
other
and
now
as
we
have
said
they
were
sleeping
or
pretending
to
sleep
as
they
were
drawn
by
two
horses
at
full
speed
along
the
road
of
avignon
to
orange
chapter
vi
morgan
our
readers
must
permit
us
for
an
instant
to
abandon
roland
and
sir
john
who
thanks
to
the
physical
and
moral
conditions
in
which
we
left
them
need
inspire
no
anxiety
while
we
direct
our
attention
seriously
to
a
personage
who
has
so
far
made
but
a
brief
appearance
in
this
history
though
he
is
destined
to
play
an
important
part
in
it
we
are
speaking
of
the
man
who
armed
and
masked
entered
the
room
of
the
table
d
hôte
at
avignon
to
return
jean
picot
the
two
hundred
louis
which
had
been
stolen
from
him
by
mistake
stored
as
it
had
been
with
the
government
money
we
speak
of
the
highwayman
who
called
himself
morgan
he
had
ridden
into
avignon
masked
in
broad
daylight
entered
the
hotel
of
the
leaving
his
horse
at
the
door
this
horse
had
enjoyed
the
same
immunity
in
the
pontifical
and
royalist
town
as
his
master
he
found
it
again
at
the
horse
post
unfastened
its
bridle
sprang
into
the
saddle
rode
through
the
porte
d
oulle
skirting
the
walls
and
disappeared
at
a
gallop
along
the
road
to
lyons
only
about
of
a
mile
from
avignon
he
drew
his
mantle
closer
about
him
to
conceal
his
weapons
from
the
passers
and
removing
his
mask
he
slipped
it
into
one
of
the
holsters
of
his
saddle
the
persons
whom
he
had
left
at
avignon
who
were
curious
to
know
if
this
could
be
the
terrible
morgan
the
terror
of
the
midi
might
have
convinced
themselves
with
their
own
eyes
had
they
met
him
on
the
road
between
avignon
and
bédarides
whether
the
bandit
s
appearance
was
as
terrifying
as
his
renown
we
do
not
hesitate
to
assert
that
the
features
now
revealed
would
have
harmonized
so
little
with
the
picture
their
prejudiced
imagination
had
conjured
up
that
their
amazement
would
have
been
extreme
the
removal
of
the
mask
by
a
hand
of
perfect
whiteness
and
delicacy
revealed
the
face
of
a
young
man
of
or
five
years
of
age
a
face
that
by
its
regularity
of
feature
and
gentle
expression
had
something
of
the
character
of
a
woman
s
one
detail
alone
gave
it
or
rather
would
give
it
at
certain
moments
a
touch
of
singular
firmness
beneath
the
beautiful
fair
hair
waving
on
his
brow
and
temples
as
was
the
fashion
at
that
period
eyebrows
eyes
and
lashes
were
black
as
ebony
the
rest
of
the
face
was
as
we
have
said
almost
feminine
there
were
two
little
ears
of
which
only
the
tips
could
be
seen
beneath
the
tufts
of
hair
to
which
the
incroyables
of
the
day
had
given
the
name
of
dog
a
straight
perfectly
proportioned
nose
a
rather
large
mouth
rosy
and
always
smiling
and
which
when
smiling
revealed
a
double
row
of
brilliant
teeth
a
delicate
refined
chin
faintly
tinged
with
blue
showing
that
if
the
beard
had
not
been
carefully
and
recently
shaved
it
would
protesting
against
the
golden
hair
have
followed
the
same
color
as
the
brows
lashes
and
eyes
that
is
to
say
a
decided
black
as
for
the
unknown
s
figure
it
was
seen
when
he
entered
the
to
be
tall
and
flexible
denoting
if
not
great
muscular
strength
at
least
much
suppleness
and
agility
the
manner
he
sat
his
horse
showed
him
to
be
a
practiced
rider
with
his
cloak
thrown
back
over
his
shoulders
his
mask
hidden
in
the
holster
his
hat
pulled
low
over
his
eyes
the
rider
resumed
his
rapid
pace
checked
for
an
instant
passed
through
bédarides
at
a
gallop
and
reaching
the
first
houses
in
orange
entered
the
gate
of
one
which
closed
immediately
behind
him
a
servant
in
waiting
sprang
to
the
bit
the
rider
dismounted
quickly
is
your
master
here
he
asked
the
domestic
no
monsieur
the
baron
replied
the
man
he
was
obliged
to
go
away
last
night
but
he
left
word
that
if
monsieur
should
ask
for
him
to
say
that
he
had
gone
in
the
interests
of
the
very
good
baptiste
i
have
brought
back
his
horse
in
good
condition
though
somewhat
tired
rub
him
down
with
wine
and
give
him
for
two
or
three
days
barley
instead
of
oats
he
has
covered
something
like
one
hundred
miles
since
yesterday
monsieur
the
baron
was
satisfied
with
him
perfectly
satisfied
is
the
carriage
ready
yes
monsieur
the
baron
all
harnessed
in
the
the
postilion
is
drinking
with
julien
monsieur
recommended
that
he
should
be
kept
outside
the
house
that
he
might
not
see
him
he
thinks
he
is
to
take
your
master
yes
monsieur
the
baron
here
is
my
master
s
passport
which
we
used
to
get
the
and
as
my
master
has
gone
in
the
direction
of
bordeaux
with
monsieur
the
baron
s
passport
and
as
monsieur
the
baron
goes
toward
geneva
with
my
master
s
passport
the
skein
will
probably
be
so
tangled
that
the
police
clever
as
their
fingers
are
can
t
easily
unravel
unfasten
the
valise
that
is
on
the
croup
of
my
saddle
baptiste
and
give
it
to
baptiste
obeyed
dutifully
but
the
valise
almost
slipped
from
his
hands
ah
said
he
laughing
monsieur
the
baron
did
not
warn
me
the
devil
monsieur
the
baron
has
not
wasted
his
time
it
just
where
you
re
mistaken
baptiste
if
i
didn
t
waste
all
my
time
i
at
least
lost
a
good
deal
so
i
should
like
to
be
off
again
as
soon
as
but
monsieur
the
baron
will
breakfast
i
ll
eat
a
bite
but
monsieur
will
not
be
delayed
it
is
now
two
and
breakfast
has
been
ready
since
ten
this
morning
luckily
it
s
a
cold
and
baptiste
in
the
absence
of
his
master
did
the
honors
of
the
house
to
the
visitor
by
showing
him
the
way
to
the
not
necessary
said
the
visitor
i
know
the
way
do
you
see
to
the
carriage
let
it
be
close
to
the
house
with
the
door
wide
open
when
i
come
out
so
that
the
postilion
can
t
see
me
here
s
the
money
to
pay
him
for
the
first
and
the
stranger
whom
baptiste
had
addressed
as
baron
handed
him
a
handful
of
notes
why
monsieur
said
the
servant
you
have
given
me
enough
to
pay
all
the
way
to
lyons
pay
him
as
far
as
valence
under
pretext
that
i
want
to
sleep
and
keep
the
rest
for
your
trouble
in
settling
the
shall
i
put
the
valise
in
the
i
will
do
so
and
taking
the
valise
from
the
servant
s
hands
without
letting
it
be
seen
that
it
weighed
heavily
he
turned
toward
the
while
baptiste
made
his
way
toward
the
nearest
inn
sorting
his
notes
as
he
went
as
the
stranger
had
said
the
way
was
familiar
to
him
for
he
passed
down
a
corridor
opened
a
first
door
without
hesitation
then
a
second
and
found
himself
before
a
table
elegantly
served
a
cold
fowl
two
partridges
a
ham
several
kinds
of
cheese
a
dessert
of
magnificent
fruit
and
two
decanters
the
one
containing
a
wine
and
the
other
a
made
a
breakfast
which
though
evidently
intended
for
but
one
person
as
only
one
place
was
set
might
in
case
of
need
have
sufficed
for
three
or
four
the
young
man
s
first
act
on
entering
the
was
to
go
straight
to
a
mirror
remove
his
hat
arrange
his
hair
with
a
little
comb
which
he
took
from
his
pocket
after
which
he
went
to
a
porcelain
basin
with
a
reservoir
above
it
took
a
towel
which
was
there
for
the
purpose
and
bathed
his
face
and
hands
not
until
these
ablutions
were
completed
characteristic
of
a
man
of
elegant
habits
not
until
these
ablutions
had
been
minutely
performed
did
the
stranger
sit
down
to
the
table
a
few
minutes
sufficed
to
satisfy
his
appetite
to
which
youth
and
fatigue
had
however
given
magnificent
proportions
and
when
baptiste
came
in
to
inform
the
solitary
guest
that
the
carriage
was
ready
he
found
him
already
afoot
and
waiting
the
stranger
drew
his
hat
low
over
his
eyes
wrapped
his
coat
about
him
took
the
valise
under
his
arm
and
as
baptiste
had
taken
pains
to
lower
the
as
close
as
possible
to
the
door
he
sprang
into
the
without
being
seen
by
the
postilion
baptiste
slammed
the
door
after
him
then
addressing
the
man
in
the
everything
is
paid
to
valence
isn
t
it
relays
and
fees
he
asked
everything
do
you
want
a
receipt
replied
the
postilion
jokingly
no
but
my
master
the
marquise
de
ribier
don
t
want
to
be
disturbed
until
he
gets
to
all
right
replied
the
postilion
in
the
same
bantering
tone
the
citizen
marquis
shan
t
be
disturbed
forward
and
he
started
his
horses
and
cracked
his
whip
with
that
noisy
eloquence
which
says
to
neighbors
and
ware
here
ware
there
i
am
driving
a
man
who
pays
well
and
who
has
the
right
to
run
over
once
in
the
carriage
the
pretended
marquis
of
ribier
opened
the
window
lowered
the
blinds
raised
the
seat
put
his
valise
in
the
hollow
sat
down
on
it
wrapped
himself
in
his
cloak
and
certain
of
not
being
disturbed
till
he
reached
valence
slept
as
he
had
breakfasted
that
is
to
say
with
all
the
appetite
of
youth
they
went
from
orange
to
valence
in
eight
hours
our
traveller
awakened
shortly
before
entering
the
city
raising
one
of
the
blinds
cautiously
he
recognized
the
little
suburb
of
paillasse
it
was
dark
so
he
struck
his
repeater
and
found
it
was
eleven
at
night
thinking
it
useless
to
go
to
sleep
again
he
added
up
the
cost
of
the
relays
to
lyons
and
counted
out
the
money
as
the
postilion
at
valence
passed
the
comrade
who
replaced
him
the
traveller
heard
him
say
it
seems
he
s
a
but
he
was
recommended
from
orange
and
as
he
pays
twenty
sous
fees
you
must
treat
him
as
you
would
a
very
well
replied
the
other
he
shall
be
driven
the
traveller
thought
the
time
had
come
to
intervene
he
raised
the
blind
and
said
and
you
ll
only
be
doing
me
justice
a
patriot
deuce
take
it
i
pride
myself
upon
being
one
and
of
the
first
calibre
too
and
the
proof
is
drink
this
to
the
health
of
the
and
he
handed
a
assignat
to
the
postilion
who
had
recommended
him
to
his
comrade
seeing
the
other
looking
eagerly
at
this
strip
of
paper
he
continued
and
the
same
to
you
if
you
will
repeat
the
recommendation
you
ve
just
received
to
the
oh
don
t
worry
citizen
said
the
postilion
there
ll
be
but
one
order
to
lyons
full
speed
and
here

the
money
for
the
sixteen
posts
including
the
double
post
of
entrance

twenty
sous
fees
settle
it
among
the
postilion
dug
his
spurs
into
his
horse
and
they
were
off
at
a
gallop
the
carriage
relayed
at
lyons
about
four
in
the
afternoon
while
the
horses
were
being
changed
a
man
clad
like
a
porter
sitting
with
his
stretcher
beside
him
on
a
stone
post
rose
came
to
the
carriage
and
said
something
in
a
low
tone
to
the
young
companion
of
jehu
which
seemed
to
astonish
the
latter
greatly
are
you
quite
sure
he
asked
the
porter
i
tell
you
that
i
saw
him
with
my
own
eyes
replied
the
latter
then
i
can
give
the
news
to
our
friends
as
a
positive
fact
you
can
only
have
they
been
notified
at
servas
yes
you
will
find
a
horse
ready
between
servas
and
the
postilion
came
up
the
young
man
exchanged
a
last
glance
with
the
porter
who
walked
away
as
if
charged
with
a
letter
of
the
utmost
importance
what
road
citizen
asked
the
postilion
to
bourg
i
must

servas

sous
miles
in
five
hours
that
s
tough
well
after
all
it
can
be
will
you
do
we
can
and
the
postilion
started
at
full
gallop
nine
o
clock
was
striking
as
they
entered
servas
a
crown
of
six
livres
if
you
ll
drive
me
to
sue
without
stopping
here
to
change
horses
cried
the
young
man
through
the
window
to
the
postilion
done
replied
the
latter
and
the
carriage
dashed
past
the
post
house
without
stopping
morgan
stopped
the
carriage
at
a
half
mile
beyond
servas
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
made
a
trumpet
of
his
hands
and
gave
the
hoot
of
a
the
imitation
was
so
perfect
that
another
owl
answered
from
a
neighboring
woods
here
we
are
cried
morgan
the
postilion
pulled
up
saying
if
we
re
there
we
needn
t
go
the
young
man
took
his
valise
opened
the
door
jumped
out
and
stepped
up
to
the
postilion
here
s
the
promised
the
postilion
took
the
coin
and
stuck
it
in
his
eye
as
a
fop
of
our
day
holds
his
morgan
divined
that
this
pantomime
had
a
significance
well
he
asked
what
does
that
mean
that
means
said
the
postilion
that
do
what
i
will
i
can
t
help
seeing
with
the
other
i
understand
said
the
young
man
laughing
and
if
i
close
the
other
eye
damn
it
i
shan
t
see
hey
you
re
a
rogue
who
d
rather
be
blind
than
see
with
one
eye
well
there
s
no
disputing
tastes
here
and
he
gave
him
a
second
crown
the
postilion
stuck
it
up
to
his
other
eye
wheeled
the
carriage
round
and
took
the
road
back
to
servas
the
companion
of
jehu
waited
till
he
vanished
in
the
darkness
then
putting
the
hollow
of
a
key
to
his
lips
he
drew
a
long
trembling
sound
from
it
like
a
boatswain
s
whistle
a
similar
call
answered
him
and
immediately
a
horseman
came
out
of
the
woods
at
full
gallop
as
he
caught
sight
of
him
morgan
put
on
his
mask
in
whose
name
have
you
come
asked
the
rider
whose
face
hidden
as
it
was
beneath
the
brim
of
an
immense
hat
could
not
be
seen
in
the
name
of
the
prophet
elisha
replied
the
young
man
with
the
mask
then
you
are
he
whom
i
am
waiting
and
he
dismounted
are
you
prophet
or
disciple
asked
morgan
disciple
replied
the
where
is
your
master
you
will
find
him
at
the
chartreuse
of
do
you
know
how
many
companions
are
there
this
evening
very
good
if
you
meet
any
others
send
them
he
who
had
called
himself
a
disciple
bowed
in
sign
of
obedience
assisted
morgan
to
fasten
the
valise
to
the
croup
of
the
saddle
and
respectfully
held
the
bit
while
the
young
man
mounted
without
even
waiting
to
thrust
his
other
foot
into
the
stirrup
morgan
spurred
his
horse
which
tore
the
bit
from
the
groom
s
hand
and
started
off
at
a
gallop
on
the
right
of
the
road
stretched
the
forest
of
seillon
like
a
shadowy
sea
its
sombre
billows
undulating
and
moaning
in
the
night
wind
half
a
mile
beyond
sue
the
rider
turned
his
horse
across
country
toward
the
forest
which
as
he
rode
on
seemed
to
advance
toward
him
the
horse
guided
by
an
experienced
hand
plunged
fearlessly
into
the
woods
ten
minutes
later
he
emerged
on
the
other
side
a
gloomy
mass
isolated
in
the
middle
of
a
plain
rose
about
a
hundred
feet
from
the
forest
it
was
a
building
of
massive
architecture
shaded
by
five
or
six
venerable
trees
the
horseman
paused
before
the
portal
over
which
were
placed
three
statues
in
a
triangle
of
the
virgin
our
lord
and
john
the
baptist
the
statue
of
the
virgin
was
at
the
apex
of
the
triangle
the
mysterious
traveller
had
reached
his
goal
for
this
was
the
chartreuse
of
seillon
this
monastery
the
of
its
order
was
founded
in
in
a
modern
edifice
had
been
substituted
for
the
old
building
vestiges
of
its
ruins
can
be
seen
to
this
day
these
ruins
consist
externally
of
the
portal
with
the
three
statues
before
which
our
mysterious
traveller
halted
internally
a
small
chapel
entered
from
the
right
through
the
portal
a
peasant
his
wife
and
two
children
are
now
living
there
and
the
ancient
monastery
has
become
a
farm
the
monks
were
expelled
from
their
convent
in
in
the
chartreuse
and
its
dependencies
were
offered
for
sale
as
ecclesiastical
property
the
dependencies
consisted
first
of
the
park
adjoining
the
buildings
and
the
noble
forest
which
still
bears
the
name
of
seillon
but
at
bourg
a
royalist
and
above
all
religious
town
no
one
dared
risk
his
soul
by
purchasing
property
belonging
to
the
worthy
monks
whom
all
revered
the
result
was
that
the
convent
the
park
and
the
forest
had
become
under
the
title
of
state
property
the
property
of
the
republic
that
is
to
say
they
belonged
to
nobody
or
were
at
the
best
neglected
the
republic
having
for
the
last
seven
years
other
things
to
think
of
than
pointing
walls
cultivating
an
orchard
and
cutting
timber
for
seven
years
therefore
the
chartreuse
had
been
completely
abandoned
and
if
by
chance
curious
eyes
peered
through
the
keyhole
they
caught
glimpses
of
courtyards
brambles
in
the
orchard
and
brush
in
the
forest
which
except
for
one
road
and
two
or
three
paths
that
crossed
it
had
become
almost
impenetrable
the
correrie
a
species
of
pavilion
belonging
to
the
monastery
and
distant
from
it
about
of
a
mile
was
mossgrown
too
in
the
tangle
of
the
forest
which
profiting
by
its
liberty
grew
at
its
own
sweet
will
and
had
long
since
encircled
it
in
a
mantle
of
foliage
which
hid
it
from
sight
for
the
rest
the
strangest
rumors
were
current
about
these
two
buildings
they
were
said
to
be
haunted
by
guests
invisible
by
day
terrifying
at
night
the
woodsmen
and
the
belated
peasants
who
went
to
the
forest
to
exercise
against
the
republic
the
rights
which
the
town
of
bourg
had
enjoyed
in
the
days
of
the
monks
pretended
that
through
the
cracks
of
the
closed
blinds
they
had
seen
flames
of
fire
dancing
along
the
corridors
and
stairways
and
had
distinctly
heard
the
noise
of
chains
clanking
over
the
cloister
tilings
and
the
pavement
of
the
courtyards
the
denied
these
things
but
two
very
opposite
classes
opposed
the
unbelievers
confirming
the
rumors
attributing
these
terrifying
noises
and
nocturnal
lights
to
two
different
causes
according
to
their
beliefs
the
patriots
declared
that
they
were
the
ghosts
of
the
poor
monks
buried
alive
by
cloister
tyranny
in
the
who
were
now
returned
to
earth
dragging
after
them
their
fetters
to
call
down
the
vengeance
of
heaven
upon
their
persecutors
the
royalists
said
that
they
were
the
imps
of
the
devil
who
finding
an
empty
convent
and
fearing
no
further
danger
from
holy
water
were
boldly
holding
their
revels
where
once
they
had
not
dared
show
a
claw
one
fact
however
left
everything
uncertain
not
one
of
the
believers
or
unbelievers
whether
he
elected
for
the
souls
of
the
martyred
monks
or
for
the
witches
sabbath
of
beelzebub
had
ever
had
the
courage
to
venture
among
the
shadows
and
to
seek
during
the
solemn
hours
of
night
confirmation
of
the
truth
in
order
to
tell
on
the
morrow
whether
the
chartreuse
were
haunted
and
if
haunted
by
whom
but
doubtless
these
tales
whether
well
founded
or
not
had
no
influence
over
our
mysterious
horseman
for
although
as
we
have
said
nine
o
clock
had
chimed
from
the
steeples
of
bourg
and
night
had
fallen
he
reined
in
his
horse
in
front
of
the
great
portal
of
the
deserted
monastery
and
without
dismounting
drew
a
pistol
from
his
holster
striking
three
measured
blows
with
the
butt
on
the
gate
after
the
manner
of
the
freemasons
then
he
listened
for
an
instant
he
doubted
if
the
meeting
were
really
there
for
though
he
looked
closely
and
listened
attentively
he
could
perceive
no
light
nor
could
he
hear
a
sound
still
he
fancied
he
heard
a
cautious
step
approaching
the
portal
from
within
he
knocked
a
second
time
with
the
same
weapon
and
in
the
same
manner
who
knocks
demanded
a
voice
he
who
comes
from
elisha
replied
the
traveller
what
king
do
the
sons
of
isaac
obey
what
house
are
they
to
exterminate
that
of
are
you
prophet
or
disciple
welcome
then
to
the
house
of
the
lord
said
the
voice
instantly
the
iron
bars
which
secured
the
massive
portal
swung
back
the
bolts
grated
in
their
sockets
half
of
the
gate
opened
silently
and
the
horse
and
his
rider
passed
beneath
the
sombre
vault
which
immediately
closed
behind
them
the
person
who
had
opened
the
gate
so
slow
to
open
so
quick
to
close
was
attired
in
the
long
white
robe
of
a
chartreuse
monk
of
which
the
hood
falling
over
his
face
completely
concealed
his
features
chapter
vii
the
chartreuse
of
seillon
beyond
doubt
like
the
first
affiliated
member
met
on
the
road
to
sue
by
the
man
who
styled
himself
prophet
the
monk
who
opened
the
gate
was
of
secondary
rank
in
the
fraternity
for
grasping
the
horse
s
bridle
he
held
it
while
the
rider
dismounted
rendering
the
young
man
the
service
of
a
groom
morgan
got
off
unfastened
the
valise
pulled
the
pistols
from
the
holsters
and
placed
them
in
his
belt
next
to
those
already
there
addressing
the
monk
in
a
tone
of
command
he
said
i
thought
i
should
find
the
brothers
assembled
in
they
are
assembled
replied
the
monk
where
at
la
correrie
suspicious
persons
have
been
seen
prowling
around
the
chartreuse
these
last
few
days
and
orders
have
been
issued
to
take
the
greatest
the
young
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
if
he
considered
such
precautions
useless
and
always
in
the
same
tone
of
command
said
have
some
one
take
my
horse
to
the
stable
and
conduct
me
to
the
the
monk
summoned
another
brother
to
whom
he
flung
the
bridle
he
lighted
a
torch
at
a
lamp
in
the
little
chapel
which
can
still
be
seen
to
the
right
of
the
great
portal
and
walked
before
the
crossing
the
cloister
he
took
a
few
steps
in
the
garden
opened
a
door
leading
into
a
sort
of
cistern
invited
morgan
to
enter
closed
it
as
carefully
as
he
had
the
outer
door
touched
with
his
foot
a
stone
which
seemed
to
be
accidentally
lying
there
disclosed
a
ring
and
raised
a
slab
which
concealed
a
flight
of
steps
leading
down
to
a
subterraneous
passage
this
passage
had
a
rounded
roof
and
was
wide
enough
to
admit
two
men
walking
abreast
the
two
men
proceeded
thus
for
five
or
six
minutes
when
they
reached
a
grated
door
the
monk
drawing
a
key
from
his
frock
opened
it
then
when
both
had
passed
through
and
the
door
was
locked
again
he
asked
by
what
name
shall
i
announce
you
as
brother
wait
here
i
will
return
in
five
the
young
man
made
a
sign
with
his
head
which
showed
that
he
was
familiar
with
these
precautions
and
this
distrust
then
he
sat
down
upon
a
tomb
they
were
in
the
mortuary
vaults
of
the
convent
and
waited
five
minutes
had
scarcely
elapsed
before
the
monk
reappeared
follow
me
said
he
the
brothers
are
glad
you
have
come
they
feared
you
had
met
with
some
a
few
seconds
later
morgan
was
admitted
into
the
council
chamber
twelve
monks
awaited
him
their
hoods
drawn
low
over
their
eyes
but
once
the
door
had
closed
and
the
serving
brother
had
disappeared
while
morgan
was
removing
his
mask
the
hoods
were
thrown
back
and
each
monk
exposed
his
face
no
brotherhood
had
ever
been
graced
by
a
more
brilliant
assemblage
of
handsome
and
joyous
young
men
two
or
three
only
of
these
strange
monks
had
reached
the
age
of
forty
all
hands
were
held
out
to
morgan
and
several
warm
kisses
were
imprinted
upon
the
s
cheek
pon
my
word
said
one
who
had
welcomed
him
most
tenderly
you
have
drawn
a
mighty
thorn
from
my
foot
we
thought
you
dead
or
at
any
rate
a
dead
i
grant
you
amiet
but
prisoner
never
citizen
as
they
still
say
sometimes
and
i
hope
they
ll
not
say
it
much
longer
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
whole
affair
was
conducted
on
both
sides
with
touching
amenity
as
soon
as
the
conductor
saw
us
he
shouted
to
the
postilion
to
stop
i
even
believe
he
added
i
know
what
it
then
said
i
if
you
know
what
it
is
my
dear
friend
our
explanations
needn
t
be
the
government
money
he
asked
exactly
i
replied
then
as
there
was
a
great
commotion
inside
the
carriage
i
added
wait
first
come
down
and
assure
these
gentlemen
and
especially
the
ladies
that
we
are
folk
and
will
not
harm
them
the
ladies
you
understand
and
nobody
will
even
look
at
them
unless
they
put
their
heads
out
of
the
one
did
risk
it
my
faith
but
she
was
charming
i
threw
her
a
kiss
and
she
gave
a
little
cry
and
retired
into
the
carriage
for
all
the
world
like
galatea
and
as
there
were
no
willows
about
i
didn
t
pursue
her
in
the
meantime
the
guard
was
rummaging
in
his
in
all
expedition
and
to
such
good
purpose
indeed
that
with
the
government
money
in
his
hurry
he
passed
over
two
hundred
louis
belonging
to
a
poor
wine
merchant
of
ah
the
devil
exclaimed
the
brother
called
amiet
an
assumed
name
probably
like
that
of
morgan
that
is
annoying
you
know
the
directory
which
is
most
imaginative
has
organized
some
bands
of
chauffeurs
who
operate
in
our
name
to
make
people
believe
that
we
rob
private
individuals
in
other
words
that
we
are
mere
wait
an
instant
resumed
morgan
that
is
just
what
makes
me
late
i
heard
something
similar
at
lyons
i
was
to
valence
when
i
discovered
this
breach
of
etiquette
it
was
not
difficult
for
as
if
the
good
man
had
foreseen
what
happened
he
had
marked
his
bag
jean
picot
wine
merchant
at
fronsac
and
you
sent
his
money
back
to
him
i
did
better
i
returned
it
to
at
fronsac
ah
no
but
at
avignon
i
suspected
that
so
careful
a
man
would
stop
at
the
first
large
town
to
inquire
what
chance
he
had
to
recover
his
two
hundred
louis
i
was
not
mistaken
i
inquired
at
the
inn
if
they
knew
citizen
jean
picot
they
replied
that
not
only
did
they
know
him
but
in
fact
he
was
then
dining
at
the
table
d
hôte
i
went
in
you
can
imagine
what
they
were
talking
about
the
stoppage
of
the
diligence
conceive
the
sensation
my
apparition
caused
the
god
of
antiquity
descending
from
the
machine
produced
a
no
more
unexpected
finale
than
i
asked
which
one
of
the
guests
was
called
jean
picot
the
owner
of
this
distinguished
and
melodious
name
stood
forth
i
placed
the
two
hundred
louis
before
him
with
many
apologies
in
the
name
of
the
company
for
the
inconvenience
its
followers
had
occasioned
him
i
exchanged
a
friendly
glance
with
barjols
and
a
polite
nod
with
the
abbé
de
rians
who
were
present
and
with
a
profound
bow
to
the
assembled
company
withdrew
it
was
only
a
little
thing
but
it
took
me
fifteen
hours
hence
the
delay
i
thought
it
preferable
to
leaving
a
false
conception
of
us
in
our
wake
have
i
done
well
my
masters
the
gathering
burst
into
bravos
only
said
one
of
the
participants
i
think
you
were
somewhat
imprudent
to
return
the
money
yourself
to
citizen
jean
my
dear
colonel
replied
the
young
man
there
s
an
italian
proverb
which
says
who
wills
goes
who
does
not
will
i
willed
i
and
there
s
a
jolly
buck
who
if
you
ever
have
the
misfortune
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
directory
will
reward
you
by
recognizing
you
a
recognition
which
means
cutting
off
your
head
oh
i
defy
him
to
recognize
what
can
prevent
it
oh
you
seem
to
think
that
i
play
such
pranks
with
my
face
uncovered
truly
my
dear
colonel
you
mistake
me
for
some
one
else
it
is
well
enough
to
lay
aside
my
mask
among
friends
but
among
strangers
no
no
are
not
these
carnival
times
i
don
t
see
why
i
shouldn
t
disguise
myself
as
abellino
or
karl
moor
when
messieurs
gohier
sieyès
roger
ducos
moulin
and
barras
are
masquerading
as
kings
of
and
you
entered
the
city
masked
the
city
the
hotel
the
it
is
true
that
if
my
face
was
covered
my
belt
was
not
and
as
you
see
it
is
well
the
young
man
tossed
aside
his
coat
displaying
his
belt
which
was
furnished
with
four
pistols
and
a
short
then
with
a
gayety
which
seemed
characteristic
of
his
careless
nature
he
added
i
ought
to
look
ferocious
oughtn
t
i
they
may
have
taken
me
for
the
late
mandrin
descending
from
the
mountains
of
savoy
by
the
bye
here
are
the
sixty
thousand
francs
of
her
highness
the
and
the
young
man
disdainfully
kicked
the
valise
which
he
had
placed
on
the
ground
which
emitted
a
metallic
sound
indicating
the
presence
of
gold
then
he
mingled
with
the
group
of
friends
from
whom
he
had
been
separated
by
the
natural
distance
between
a
narrator
and
his
listeners
one
of
the
monks
stooped
and
lifted
the
valise
despise
gold
as
much
as
you
please
my
dear
morgan
since
that
doesn
t
prevent
you
from
capturing
it
but
i
know
of
some
brave
fellows
who
are
awaiting
these
sixty
thousand
francs
you
so
disdainfully
kick
aside
with
as
much
impatience
and
anxiety
as
a
caravan
lost
in
the
desert
awaits
the
drop
of
water
which
is
to
save
it
from
dying
of
our
friends
of
the
vendée
i
suppose
replied
morgan
much
good
may
it
do
them
egotists
they
are
fighting
these
gentlemen
have
chosen
the
roses
and
left
us
the
thorns
come
don
t
they
receive
anything
from
england
oh
yes
said
one
of
the
monks
gayly
at
quiberon
they
got
bullets
and
i
did
not
say
from
the
english
retorted
morgan
i
said
from
not
a
it
seems
to
me
however
said
one
of
those
present
who
apparently
possessed
a
more
reflective
head
than
his
comrades
it
seems
to
me
that
our
princes
might
send
a
little
gold
to
those
who
are
shedding
their
blood
for
the
monarchy
are
they
not
afraid
the
vendée
may
weary
some
day
or
other
of
a
devotion
which
up
to
this
time
has
not
to
my
knowledge
won
her
a
word
of
the
vendée
dear
friend
replied
morgan
is
a
generous
land
which
will
not
weary
you
may
be
sure
besides
where
is
the
merit
of
fidelity
unless
it
has
to
deal
with
ingratitude
from
the
instant
devotion
meets
recognition
it
is
no
longer
devotion
it
becomes
an
exchange
which
reaps
its
reward
let
us
be
always
faithful
and
always
devoted
gentlemen
praying
heaven
that
those
whom
we
serve
may
remain
ungrateful
and
then
believe
me
we
shall
bear
the
better
part
in
the
history
of
our
civil
morgan
had
scarcely
formulated
this
chivalric
axiom
expressive
of
a
desire
which
had
every
chance
of
accomplishment
than
three
masonic
blows
resounded
upon
the
door
through
which
he
had
entered
gentlemen
said
the
monk
who
seemed
to
fill
the
rôle
of
president
quick
your
hoods
and
masks
we
do
not
know
who
may
be
coming
to
chapter
viii
how
the
money
of
the
directory
was
used
every
one
hastened
to
obey
the
monks
lowered
the
hoods
of
their
long
robes
over
their
faces
morgan
replaced
his
mask
enter
said
the
superior
the
door
opened
and
the
appeared
an
emissary
from
general
georges
cadoudal
asks
to
be
admitted
said
he
did
he
reply
to
the
three
passwords
then
let
him
the
lay
brother
retired
to
the
subterranean
passage
and
reappeared
a
couple
of
minutes
later
leading
a
man
easily
recognized
by
his
costume
as
a
peasant
and
by
his
square
head
with
its
shock
of
red
hair
for
a
breton
he
advanced
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
without
appearing
in
the
least
intimidated
fixing
his
eyes
on
each
of
the
monks
in
turn
and
waiting
until
one
of
these
twelve
granite
statues
should
break
silence
the
president
was
the
first
to
speak
to
him
from
whom
do
you
come
he
asked
him
he
who
sent
me
replied
the
peasant
ordered
me
to
answer
if
i
were
asked
that
question
that
i
was
sent
by
are
you
the
bearer
of
a
verbal
or
written
message
i
am
to
reply
to
the
questions
which
you
ask
me
and
exchange
a
slip
of
paper
for
some
very
good
we
will
begin
with
the
questions
what
are
our
brothers
in
the
vendée
doing
they
have
laid
down
their
arms
and
are
awaiting
only
a
word
from
you
to
take
them
up
and
why
did
they
lay
down
their
arms
they
received
the
order
to
do
so
from
his
majesty
louis
there
is
talk
of
a
proclamation
written
by
the
king
s
own
hand
have
they
received
it
here
is
a
the
peasant
gave
a
paper
to
the
person
who
was
interrogating
him
the
latter
opened
it
and
read
the
war
has
absolutely
no
result
save
that
of
making
the
monarchy
odious
and
threatening
monarchs
who
return
to
their
own
through
its
bloody
succor
are
never
loved
these
sanguinary
measures
must
therefore
be
abandoned
confide
in
the
empire
of
opinion
which
returns
of
itself
to
its
saving
principles
god
and
the
king
will
soon
be
the
rallying
cry
of
all
frenchmen
the
scattered
elements
of
royalism
must
be
gathered
into
one
formidable
sheaf
militant
vendée
must
be
abandoned
to
its
unhappy
fate
and
marched
within
a
more
pacific
and
less
erratic
path
the
royalists
of
the
west
have
fulfilled
their
duty
those
of
paris
who
have
prepared
everything
for
the
approaching
restoration
must
now
be
relied
upon
the
president
raised
his
head
and
seeking
morgan
with
a
flash
of
the
eye
which
his
hood
could
not
entirely
conceal
said
well
brother
i
think
this
is
the
fulfilment
of
your
wish
of
a
few
moments
ago
the
royalists
of
the
vendée
and
the
midi
will
have
the
merit
of
pure
then
lowering
his
eyes
to
the
proclamation
of
which
there
still
remained
a
few
lines
to
read
he
continued
the
jews
crucified
their
king
and
since
that
time
they
have
wandered
over
the
face
of
the
earth
the
french
guillotined
theirs
and
they
shall
be
dispersed
throughout
the
land
given
at
blankenbourg
this
of
august
on
the
day
of
louis
and
the
sixth
year
of
our
reign
signed
louis
the
young
men
looked
at
each
other
quos
vult
perdere
jupiter
dementat
said
morgan
yes
said
the
president
but
when
those
whom
jupiter
wishes
to
destroy
represent
a
principle
they
must
be
sustained
not
only
against
jupiter
but
against
themselves
ajax
in
the
midst
of
the
bolts
and
lightning
clung
to
a
rock
and
threatening
heaven
with
his
clinched
hand
he
cried
i
will
escape
in
spite
of
the
gods
then
turning
toward
cadoudal
s
envoy
and
what
answer
did
he
who
sent
you
make
to
this
proclamation
about
what
you
yourself
have
just
answered
he
told
me
to
come
and
inform
myself
whether
you
had
decided
to
hold
firm
in
spite
of
all
in
spite
of
the
king
by
heavens
yes
said
morgan
we
are
determined
said
the
president
in
that
case
replied
the
peasant
all
is
well
here
are
the
real
names
of
our
new
chiefs
and
their
assumed
names
the
general
recommends
that
you
use
only
the
latter
as
far
as
is
possible
in
your
despatches
he
observes
that
precaution
when
he
on
his
side
speaks
of
have
you
the
list
asked
the
president
no
i
might
have
been
stopped
and
the
list
taken
write
yourself
i
will
dictate
them
to
the
president
seated
himself
at
the
table
took
a
pen
and
wrote
the
following
names
under
the
dictation
of
the
breton
peasant
georges
cadoudal
jehu
or
roundhead
joseph
cadoudal
judas
maccabeus
lahaye
david
poulpiquez
bonfils
dampherné
piquevers
duchayla
la
couronne
duparc
le
terrible
la
roche
mithridates
puisaye
jean
le
and
these
are
the
successors
of
charette
stoffiet
cathelineau
bonchamp
d
elbée
la
rochejaquelin
and
lescure
cried
a
voice
the
breton
turned
toward
him
who
had
just
spoken
if
they
get
themselves
killed
like
their
predecessors
said
he
what
more
can
you
ask
of
them
well
answered
said
morgan
so
that
so
that
as
soon
as
our
general
has
your
reply
answered
the
peasant
he
will
take
up
arms
and
suppose
our
reply
had
been
in
the
negative
asked
another
voice
so
much
the
worse
for
you
replied
the
peasant
in
any
case
the
insurrection
is
fixed
for
october
well
said
the
president
thanks
to
us
the
general
will
have
the
wherewithal
for
his
first
month
s
pay
where
is
your
receipt
here
said
the
peasant
drawing
a
paper
from
his
pocket
on
which
were
written
these
words
received
from
our
brothers
of
the
midi
and
the
east
to
be
employed
for
the
good
of
the
cause
the
sum
of
georges
cadoudal
general
commanding
the
royalist
army
of
brittany
the
sum
was
left
blank
do
you
know
how
to
write
asked
the
president
enough
to
fill
in
the
three
or
four
missing
very
well
then
write
one
hundred
thousand
the
breton
wrote
then
extending
the
paper
to
the
president
he
said
here
is
your
receipt
where
is
the
money
stoop
and
pick
up
the
bag
at
your
feet
it
contains
sixty
thousand
then
addressing
one
of
the
monks
he
asked
montbard
where
are
the
remaining
forty
thousand
the
monk
thus
interpellated
opened
a
closet
and
brought
forth
a
bag
somewhat
smaller
than
the
one
morgan
had
brought
but
which
nevertheless
contained
the
good
round
sum
of
forty
thousand
francs
here
is
the
full
amount
said
the
monk
now
my
friend
said
the
president
get
something
to
eat
and
some
rest
you
will
they
are
waiting
for
me
yonder
said
the
breton
i
will
eat
and
sleep
on
horseback
farewell
gentlemen
heaven
keep
you
and
he
went
toward
the
door
by
which
he
had
entered
wait
said
morgan
the
messenger
paused
news
for
news
said
morgan
tell
general
cadoudal
that
general
bonaparte
has
left
the
army
in
egypt
that
he
landed
at
fréjus
day
before
yesterday
and
will
be
in
paris
in
three
days
my
news
is
fully
worth
yours
don
t
you
think
so
what
do
you
think
of
it
impossible
exclaimed
all
the
monks
with
one
accord
nevertheless
nothing
is
more
true
gentlemen
i
have
it
from
our
friend
the
priest
leprêtre
footnote
the
name
leprêtre
is
a
contraction
of
the
two
words
le
prêtre
meaning
the
priest
hence
the
name
under
which
this
man
died
who
saw
him
relay
at
lyons
one
hour
before
me
and
recognized
what
has
he
come
to
france
for
demanded
several
voices
faith
said
morgan
we
shall
know
some
day
it
is
probable
that
he
has
not
returned
to
paris
to
remain
there
don
t
lose
an
instant
in
carrying
this
news
to
our
brothers
in
the
west
said
the
president
to
the
peasant
a
moment
ago
i
wished
to
detain
you
now
i
say
to
you
go
the
peasant
bowed
and
withdrew
the
president
waited
until
the
door
was
closed
gentlemen
said
he
the
news
which
our
brother
morgan
has
just
imparted
to
us
is
so
grave
that
i
wish
to
propose
a
special
what
is
it
asked
the
companions
of
jehu
with
one
voice
it
is
that
one
of
us
chosen
by
lot
shall
go
to
paris
and
keep
the
rest
informed
with
the
cipher
agreed
upon
of
all
that
happens
agreed
they
replied
in
that
case
resumed
the
president
let
us
write
our
thirteen
names
each
on
a
slip
of
paper
we
put
them
in
a
hat
he
whose
name
is
first
drawn
shall
start
the
young
men
one
and
all
approached
the
table
and
wrote
their
names
on
squares
of
paper
which
they
rolled
and
dropped
into
a
hat
the
youngest
was
told
to
draw
the
lots
he
drew
one
of
the
little
rolls
of
paper
and
handed
it
to
the
president
who
unfolded
it
morgan
said
he
what
are
my
instructions
asked
the
young
man
remember
replied
the
president
with
a
solemnity
to
which
the
cloistral
arches
lent
a
supreme
grandeur
that
you
bear
the
name
and
title
of
baron
de
that
your
father
was
guillotined
on
the
place
de
la
révolution
and
that
your
brother
was
killed
in
condé
s
army
noblesse
oblige
those
are
your
and
what
else
asked
the
young
man
as
to
the
rest
said
the
president
we
rely
on
your
royalist
principles
and
your
then
my
friends
permit
me
to
bid
you
farewell
at
once
i
would
like
to
be
on
the
road
to
paris
before
dawn
and
i
must
pay
a
visit
before
my
go
said
the
president
opening
his
arms
to
morgan
i
embrace
you
in
the
name
of
the
brotherhood
to
another
i
should
say
be
brave
persevering
and
active
to
you
i
say
be
the
young
man
received
the
fraternal
embrace
smiled
to
his
other
friends
shook
hands
with
two
or
three
of
them
wrapped
himself
in
his
mantle
pulled
his
hat
over
his
eyes
and
departed
chapter
ix
romeo
and
juliet
under
the
possibility
of
immediate
departure
morgan
s
horse
after
being
washed
rubbed
down
and
dried
had
been
fed
a
double
ration
of
oats
and
been
resaddled
and
bridled
the
young
man
had
only
to
ask
for
it
and
spring
upon
its
back
he
was
no
sooner
in
the
saddle
than
the
gate
opened
as
if
by
magic
the
horse
neighed
and
darted
out
swiftly
having
forgotten
its
first
trip
and
ready
for
another
at
the
gate
of
the
chartreuse
morgan
paused
an
instant
undecided
whether
to
turn
to
the
right
or
left
he
finally
turned
to
the
right
followed
the
road
which
leads
from
bourg
to
seillon
for
a
few
moments
wheeled
rapidly
a
second
time
to
the
right
cut
across
country
plunged
into
an
angle
of
the
forest
which
was
on
his
way
reappeared
before
long
on
the
other
side
reached
the
main
road
to
ain
followed
it
for
about
a
mile
and
a
half
and
halted
near
a
group
of
houses
now
called
the
maison
des
gardes
one
of
these
houses
bore
for
sign
a
cluster
of
holly
which
indicated
one
of
those
wayside
halting
places
where
the
pedestrians
quench
their
thirst
and
rest
for
an
instant
to
recover
strength
before
continuing
the
long
fatiguing
voyage
of
life
morgan
stopped
at
the
door
drew
a
pistol
from
its
holster
and
rapped
with
the
butt
end
as
he
had
done
at
the
chartreuse
only
as
in
all
probability
the
good
folks
at
the
humble
tavern
were
far
from
being
conspirators
the
traveller
was
kept
waiting
longer
than
he
had
been
at
the
monastery
at
last
he
heard
the
echo
of
the
stable
boy
s
clumsy
sabots
the
gate
creaked
but
the
worthy
man
who
opened
it
no
sooner
perceived
the
horseman
with
his
drawn
pistol
than
he
instinctively
tried
to
close
it
again
it
is
i
patout
said
the
young
man
don
t
be
ah
sure
enough
said
the
peasant
it
is
really
you
monsieur
charles
i
m
not
afraid
now
but
you
know
as
the
curé
used
to
tell
us
in
the
days
when
there
was
a
good
god
caution
is
the
mother
of
yes
patout
yes
said
the
young
man
slipping
a
piece
of
silver
into
the
stable
boy
s
hand
but
be
easy
the
good
god
will
return
and
le
curé
oh
as
for
that
said
the
good
man
it
is
easy
to
see
that
there
is
no
one
left
on
high
by
the
way
things
go
will
this
last
much
longer
charles
patout
i
promise
in
my
honor
to
do
my
best
to
be
rid
of
all
that
annoys
you
i
am
no
less
impatient
than
you
so
i
ll
ask
you
not
to
go
to
bed
my
good
ah
you
know
well
monsieur
that
when
you
come
i
don
t
often
go
to
bed
as
for
the
horse
goodness
you
change
them
every
day
the
time
before
last
it
was
a
chestnut
the
last
time
a
now
a
black
yes
i
m
somewhat
capricious
by
nature
as
to
the
horse
as
you
say
my
dear
patout
he
wants
nothing
you
need
only
remove
his
bridle
leave
him
saddled
oh
wait
put
this
pistol
back
in
the
holsters
and
take
care
of
these
other
two
for
and
the
young
man
removed
the
two
from
his
belt
and
handed
them
to
the
hostler
well
exclaimed
the
latter
laughing
any
more
barkers
you
know
patout
they
say
the
roads
are
ah
i
should
think
they
weren
t
safe
we
re
up
to
our
necks
in
regular
highway
robberies
charles
why
no
later
than
last
week
they
stopped
and
robbed
the
diligence
between
geneva
and
bourg
indeed
exclaimed
morgan
and
whom
do
they
accuse
of
the
robbery
oh
it
s
such
a
farce
just
fancy
they
say
it
was
the
companions
of
jesus
i
don
t
believe
a
word
of
it
of
course
who
are
the
companions
of
jesus
if
not
the
twelve
apostles
of
course
said
morgan
with
his
eternally
joyous
smile
i
don
t
know
of
any
well
continued
patout
to
accuse
the
twelve
apostles
of
robbing
a
diligence
that
s
the
limit
oh
i
tell
you
charles
we
re
living
in
times
when
nobody
respects
and
shaking
his
head
like
a
misanthrope
disgusted
if
not
with
life
at
least
with
men
patout
led
the
horse
to
the
stable
as
for
morgan
he
watched
patout
till
he
saw
him
disappear
down
the
courtyard
and
enter
the
dark
stable
then
skirting
the
hedge
which
bordered
the
garden
he
went
toward
a
large
clump
of
trees
whose
lofty
tops
were
silhouetted
against
the
darkness
of
the
night
with
the
majesty
of
things
immovable
the
while
their
shadows
fell
upon
a
charming
little
country
house
known
in
the
neighborhood
as
the
château
des
as
morgan
reached
the
château
wall
the
hour
chimed
from
the
belfry
of
the
village
of
montagnac
the
young
man
counted
the
strokes
vibrating
in
the
calm
silent
atmosphere
of
the
autumn
night
it
was
eleven
o
clock
many
things
as
we
have
seen
had
happened
during
the
last
two
hours
morgan
advanced
a
few
steps
farther
examined
the
wall
apparently
in
search
of
a
familiar
spot
then
having
found
it
inserted
the
tip
of
his
boot
in
a
cleft
between
two
stones
he
sprang
up
like
a
man
mounting
a
horse
seized
the
top
of
the
wall
with
the
left
hand
and
with
a
second
spring
seated
himself
astride
the
wall
from
which
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
he
lowered
himself
on
the
other
side
all
this
was
done
with
such
rapidity
such
dexterity
and
agility
that
any
one
chancing
to
pass
at
that
instant
would
have
thought
himself
the
puppet
of
a
vision
morgan
stopped
as
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
to
listen
while
his
eyes
tried
to
pierce
the
darkness
made
deeper
by
the
foliage
of
poplars
and
aspens
and
the
heavy
shadows
of
the
little
wood
all
was
silent
and
solitary
morgan
ventured
on
his
path
we
say
ventured
because
the
young
man
since
nearing
the
château
des
revealed
in
all
his
movement
a
timidity
and
hesitation
so
foreign
to
his
character
that
it
was
evident
that
if
he
feared
it
was
not
for
himself
alone
he
gained
the
edge
of
the
wood
still
moving
cautiously
coming
to
a
lawn
at
the
end
of
which
was
the
little
château
he
paused
then
he
examined
the
front
of
the
house
only
one
of
the
twelve
windows
which
dotted
the
three
floors
was
lighted
this
was
on
the
second
floor
at
the
corner
of
the
house
a
little
balcony
covered
with
virgin
vines
which
climbed
the
walls
twining
themselves
around
the
iron
railing
and
falling
thence
in
festoons
from
the
window
overhung
the
garden
on
both
sides
of
the
windows
close
to
the
balcony
trees
met
and
formed
above
the
cornice
a
bower
of
verdure
a
venetian
blind
which
was
raised
and
lowered
by
cords
separated
the
balcony
from
the
window
a
separation
which
disappeared
at
will
it
was
through
the
interstices
of
this
blind
that
morgan
had
seen
the
light
the
young
man
s
first
impulse
was
to
cross
the
lawn
in
a
straight
line
but
again
the
fears
of
which
we
spoke
restrained
him
a
path
shaded
by
lindens
skirted
the
wall
and
led
to
the
house
he
turned
aside
and
entered
its
dark
leafy
covert
when
he
had
reached
the
end
of
the
path
he
crossed
like
a
frightened
doe
the
open
space
which
led
to
the
house
wall
and
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
deep
shadow
of
the
house
then
when
he
had
reached
the
spot
he
had
calculated
upon
he
clapped
his
hands
three
times
at
this
call
a
shadow
darted
from
the
end
of
the
apartment
and
clung
lithe
graceful
almost
transparent
to
the
window
morgan
repeated
the
signal
the
window
was
opened
immediately
the
blind
was
raised
and
a
ravishing
young
girl
in
a
night
dress
her
fair
hair
rippling
over
her
shoulders
appeared
in
the
frame
of
verdure
the
young
man
stretched
out
his
arms
to
her
whose
arms
were
stretched
out
to
him
and
two
names
or
rather
two
cries
from
the
heart
crossed
from
one
to
the
other
charles
amélie
then
the
young
man
sprang
against
the
wall
caught
at
the
vine
shoots
the
jagged
edges
of
the
rock
the
jutting
cornice
and
in
an
instant
was
on
the
balcony
what
these
two
beautiful
young
beings
said
to
each
other
was
only
a
murmur
of
love
lost
in
an
endless
kiss
then
by
gentle
effort
the
young
man
drew
the
girl
with
one
hand
to
her
chamber
while
with
the
other
he
loosened
the
cords
of
the
blind
which
fell
noisily
behind
them
the
window
closed
behind
the
blind
then
the
lamp
was
extinguished
and
the
front
of
the
château
des
was
again
in
darkness
this
darkness
had
lasted
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
the
rolling
of
a
carriage
was
heard
along
the
road
leading
from
the
highway
of
ain
to
the
entrance
of
the
château
there
the
sound
ceased
it
was
evident
that
the
carriage
had
stopped
before
the
gates
chapter
x
the
family
of
roland
the
carriage
which
had
stopped
before
the
gate
was
that
which
brought
roland
back
to
his
family
accompanied
by
sir
john
the
family
was
so
far
from
expecting
him
that
as
we
have
said
all
the
lights
in
the
house
were
extinguished
all
the
windows
in
darkness
even
amélie
s
the
postilion
had
cracked
his
whip
smartly
for
the
last
five
hundred
yards
but
the
noise
was
insufficient
to
rouse
these
country
people
from
their
first
sleep
when
the
carriage
had
stopped
roland
opened
the
door
sprang
out
without
touching
the
steps
and
tugged
at
the
five
minutes
elapsed
and
after
each
peal
roland
turned
to
the
carriage
saying
don
t
be
impatient
sir
at
last
a
window
opened
and
a
childish
but
firm
voice
cried
out
who
is
ringing
that
way
ah
is
that
you
little
edouard
said
roland
make
haste
and
let
us
the
child
leaped
back
with
a
shout
of
delight
and
disappeared
but
at
the
same
time
his
voice
was
heard
in
the
corridors
crying
mother
wake
up
it
is
roland
sister
wake
up
it
is
the
big
brother
then
clad
only
in
his
night
robe
and
his
little
slippers
he
ran
down
the
steps
crying
don
t
be
impatient
roland
here
i
an
instant
later
the
key
grated
in
the
lock
and
the
bolts
slipped
back
in
their
sockets
a
white
figure
appeared
in
the
portico
and
flew
rather
than
ran
to
the
gate
which
an
instant
later
turned
on
its
hinges
and
swung
open
the
child
sprang
upon
roland
s
neck
and
hung
there
ah
brother
brother
he
exclaimed
embracing
the
young
man
laughing
and
crying
at
the
same
time
ah
big
brother
roland
how
happy
mother
will
be
and
amélie
too
every
body
is
well
i
am
the
sickest
ah
except
michel
the
gardener
you
know
who
has
sprained
his
leg
but
why
aren
t
you
in
uniform
oh
how
ugly
you
are
in
citizen
s
clothes
have
you
just
come
from
egypt
did
you
bring
me
the
pistols
and
the
beautiful
curved
sword
no
then
you
are
not
nice
and
i
won
t
kiss
you
any
more
oh
no
no
don
t
be
afraid
i
love
you
just
the
same
and
the
boy
smothered
the
big
brother
with
kisses
while
he
showered
questions
upon
him
the
englishman
still
seated
in
the
carriage
looked
smilingly
through
the
window
at
the
scene
in
the
midst
of
these
fraternal
embraces
came
the
voice
of
a
woman
the
voice
of
the
mother
where
is
he
my
roland
my
darling
son
asked
madame
de
montrevel
in
a
voice
fraught
with
such
violent
joyous
emotion
that
it
was
almost
painful
where
is
he
can
it
be
true
that
he
has
returned
really
true
that
he
is
not
a
prisoner
not
dead
is
he
really
living
the
child
at
her
voice
slipped
from
his
brother
s
arms
like
an
eel
dropped
upon
his
feet
on
the
grass
and
as
if
moved
by
a
spring
bounded
toward
his
mother
this
way
mother
this
way
said
he
dragging
his
mother
half
dressed
as
she
was
toward
roland
when
he
saw
his
mother
roland
could
no
longer
contain
himself
he
felt
the
sort
of
icicle
that
had
petrified
his
breast
melt
and
his
heart
beat
like
that
of
his
fellowmen
ah
he
exclaimed
i
was
indeed
ungrateful
to
god
when
life
still
holds
such
joys
for
and
he
fell
sobbing
upon
madame
de
montrevel
s
neck
without
thinking
of
sir
john
who
felt
his
english
phlegm
disperse
as
he
silently
wiped
away
the
tears
that
flowed
down
his
cheeks
and
moistened
his
lips
the
child
the
mother
and
roland
formed
an
adorable
group
of
tenderness
and
emotion
suddenly
little
edouard
like
a
leaf
tossed
about
by
the
wind
flew
from
the
group
exclaiming
sister
amélie
why
where
is
she
and
he
rushed
toward
the
house
repeating
sister
amélie
wake
up
get
up
hurry
up
and
then
the
child
could
be
heard
kicking
and
rapping
against
a
door
silence
followed
then
little
edouard
shouted
help
mother
help
brother
roland
sister
amélie
is
ill
madame
de
montrevel
and
her
son
flew
toward
the
house
sir
john
consummate
tourist
that
he
was
always
carried
a
lancet
and
a
smelling
bottle
in
his
pocket
he
jumped
from
the
carriage
and
obeying
his
first
impulse
hurried
up
the
portico
there
he
paused
reflecting
that
he
had
not
been
introduced
an
formality
for
an
englishman
however
the
fainting
girl
whom
he
sought
came
toward
him
at
that
moment
the
noise
her
brother
had
made
at
the
door
brought
amélie
to
the
landing
but
without
doubt
the
excitement
which
roland
s
return
had
occasioned
was
too
much
for
her
for
after
descending
a
few
steps
in
an
almost
automatic
manner
controlling
herself
by
a
violent
effort
she
gave
a
sigh
and
like
a
flower
that
bends
a
branch
that
droops
like
a
scarf
that
floats
she
fell
or
rather
lay
upon
the
stairs
it
was
at
that
moment
that
the
child
cried
out
but
at
his
exclamation
amélie
recovered
if
not
her
strength
at
least
her
will
she
rose
and
stammering
be
quiet
edouard
be
quite
in
heaven
s
name
i
m
all
right
she
clung
to
the
balustrade
with
one
hand
and
leaning
with
the
other
on
the
child
she
had
continued
to
descend
on
the
last
step
she
met
her
mother
and
her
brother
then
with
a
violent
almost
despairing
movement
she
threw
both
arms
around
roland
s
neck
exclaiming
my
brother
my
brother
roland
feeling
the
young
girl
s
weight
press
heavily
upon
his
shoulder
exclaimed
air
air
she
is
fainting
and
carried
her
out
upon
the
portico
it
was
this
new
group
so
different
from
the
first
which
met
sir
john
s
eyes
as
soon
as
she
felt
the
fresh
air
amélie
revived
and
raised
her
head
just
then
the
moon
in
all
her
splendor
shook
off
a
cloud
which
had
veiled
her
and
lighted
amélie
s
face
as
pale
as
her
own
sir
john
gave
a
cry
of
admiration
never
had
he
seen
a
marble
statue
so
perfect
as
this
living
marble
before
his
eyes
we
must
say
that
amélie
seen
thus
was
marvelously
beautiful
clad
in
a
long
cambric
robe
which
defined
the
outlines
of
her
body
molded
on
that
of
the
polyhymnia
of
antiquity
her
pale
face
gently
inclined
upon
her
brother
s
shoulder
her
long
golden
hair
floating
around
her
snowy
shoulders
her
arm
thrown
around
her
mother
s
neck
its
alabaster
hand
drooping
upon
the
red
shawl
in
which
madame
de
montrevel
had
wrapped
herself
such
was
roland
s
sister
as
she
appeared
to
sir
john
at
the
englishman
s
cry
of
admiration
roland
remembered
that
he
was
there
and
madame
de
montrevel
perceived
his
presence
as
for
the
child
surprised
to
see
this
stranger
in
his
mother
s
home
he
ran
hastily
down
the
steps
of
the
portico
stopping
on
the
third
one
not
that
he
feared
to
go
further
but
in
order
to
be
on
a
level
with
the
person
he
proceeded
to
question
who
are
you
sir
he
asked
sir
john
and
what
are
you
doing
here
my
little
edouard
said
sir
john
i
am
your
brother
s
friend
and
i
have
brought
you
the
pistols
and
the
damascus
blade
which
he
promised
where
are
they
asked
the
child
ah
said
sir
john
they
are
in
england
and
it
will
take
some
time
to
send
for
them
but
your
big
brother
will
answer
for
me
that
i
am
a
man
of
my
yes
edouard
yes
said
roland
if
sir
john
promises
them
to
you
you
will
get
then
turning
to
madame
de
montrevel
and
his
sister
excuse
me
my
mother
excuse
me
amélie
or
rather
excuse
yourselves
as
best
you
can
to
sir
john
for
you
have
made
me
abominably
then
grasping
sir
john
s
hand
he
continued
mother
sir
john
took
occasion
the
first
time
he
saw
me
to
render
me
an
inestimable
service
i
know
that
you
never
forget
such
things
i
trust
therefore
that
you
will
always
remember
that
sir
john
is
one
of
our
best
friends
and
he
will
give
you
the
proof
of
it
by
saying
with
me
that
he
has
consented
to
be
bored
for
a
couple
of
weeks
with
madame
said
sir
john
permit
me
on
the
contrary
not
to
repeat
my
friend
roland
s
words
i
could
wish
to
spend
not
a
fortnight
nor
three
weeks
but
a
whole
lifetime
with
madame
de
montrevel
came
down
the
steps
of
the
portico
and
offered
her
hand
to
sir
john
who
kissed
it
with
a
gallantry
altogether
french
my
lord
said
she
this
house
is
yours
the
day
you
entered
it
has
been
one
of
joy
the
day
you
leave
will
be
one
of
regret
and
sir
john
turned
toward
amélie
who
confused
by
the
disorder
of
her
dress
before
this
stranger
was
gathering
the
folds
of
her
wrapper
about
her
neck
i
speak
to
you
in
my
name
and
in
my
daughter
s
who
is
still
too
much
overcome
by
her
brother
s
unexpected
return
to
greet
you
herself
as
she
will
do
in
a
moment
continued
madame
de
montrevel
coming
to
amélie
s
relief
my
sister
said
roland
will
permit
my
friend
sir
john
to
kiss
her
hand
and
he
will
i
am
sure
accept
that
form
of
amélie
stammered
a
few
words
slowly
lifted
her
arm
and
held
out
her
hand
to
sir
john
with
a
smile
that
was
almost
painful
the
englishman
took
it
but
feeling
how
icy
and
trembling
it
was
instead
of
carrying
it
to
his
lips
he
said
roland
your
sister
is
seriously
indisposed
let
us
think
only
of
her
health
this
evening
i
am
something
of
a
doctor
and
if
she
will
deign
to
permit
me
the
favor
of
feeling
her
pulse
i
shall
be
but
amélie
as
if
she
feared
that
the
cause
of
her
weakness
might
be
surmised
withdrew
her
hand
hastily
exclaiming
oh
no
sir
john
is
mistaken
joy
never
causes
illness
it
is
only
joy
at
seeing
my
brother
again
which
caused
this
slight
indisposition
and
it
has
already
passed
then
turning
to
madame
de
montrevel
she
added
with
almost
feverish
haste
mother
we
are
forgetting
that
these
gentlemen
have
made
a
long
voyage
and
have
probably
eaten
nothing
since
lyons
if
roland
has
his
usual
good
appetite
he
will
not
object
to
my
leaving
you
to
do
the
honors
of
the
house
while
i
attend
to
the
unpoetical
but
much
appreciated
details
of
the
leaving
her
mother
as
she
said
to
do
the
honors
of
the
house
amélie
went
to
waken
the
maids
and
the
manservant
leaving
on
the
mind
of
sir
john
that
sort
of
impression
which
the
tourist
on
the
rhine
brings
with
him
of
the
lorelei
on
her
rock
a
lyre
in
her
hand
the
liquid
gold
of
her
hair

in
the
evening

the
meantime
morgan
had
remounted
his
horse
returning
at
full
gallop
to
the
chartreuse
he
drew
rein
before
the
portal
pulled
out
a
and
pencilling
a
few
lines
on
one
of
the
leaves
rolled
it
up
and
slipped
it
through
the
keyhole
without
taking
time
to
dismount
then
pressing
in
both
his
spurs
and
bending
low
over
the
mane
of
the
noble
animal
he
disappeared
in
the
forest
rapid
and
mysterious
as
faust
on
his
way
to
the
mountain

the

the
three
lines
he

written
were

the

built
the
park
of
five
or
six
acres
covered
with
venerable
oaks

inclosed
on
three
sides
by
freestone
walls
one
of
which
opened
in
front
through
a
handsome
gate
of

in
the
style
of

the

bounded
by
the
little
river

its
rise
at

this

the
graceful
outlines
of
the
hills
of
the

the
summits
of
which
could
be
distinguished
the
blue
crests
of
the
mountains

seemed
to
be
standing
on
tiptoe
in

to
peer
curiously
over
their

at
what
was
passing
in
the

was
in
full
view
of
this
ravishing
landscape
that
sir
john
awoke
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
perhaps
the
morose
and
taciturn
englishman
smiled
at
nature
he
fancied
himself
in
one
of
those
beautiful
valleys
of

celebrated
by

beside
the
sweet
slopes
of

birthplace
in
spite
of
what
the
biographers
say
was
falling
into
ruins
not
three
miles
from

was
roused
by
three
light
raps
at
his
door
it
was
roland
who
came
to
see
how
he
had
passed
the
night
he
found
him
radiant
as
the
sun
playing
among
the
already
yellow
leaves
of
the
chestnuts
and
the
lindens
oh
oh
sir
john
cried
roland
permit
me
to
congratulate
you
i
expected
to
find
you
as
gloomy
as
the
poor
monks
of
the
chartreuse
with
their
long
white
robes
who
used
to
frighten
me
so
much
in
my
childhood
though
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
never
easily
frightened
instead
of
that
i
find
you
in
the
midst
of
this
dreary
october
as
smiling
as
a
morn
of
my
dear
roland
replied
sir
john
i
am
an
orphan
i
lost
my
mother
at
my
birth
and
my
father
when
i
was
twelve
years
old
at
an
age
when
children
are
usually
sent
to
school
i
was
master
of
a
fortune
producing
a
million
a
year
but
i
was
alone
in
the
world
with
no
one
whom
i
loved
or
who
loved
me
the
tender
joys
of
family
life
are
completely
unknown
to
me
from
twelve
to
eighteen
i
went
to
cambridge
but
my
taciturn
and
perhaps
haughty
character
isolated
me
from
my
fellows
at
eighteen
i
began
to
travel
you
who
scour
the
world
under
the
shadow
of
your
flag
that
is
to
say
the
shadow
of
your
country
and
are
stirred
by
the
thrill
of
battle
and
the
pride
of
glory
can
not
imagine
what
a
lamentable
thing
it
is
to
roam
through
cities
provinces
nations
and
kingdoms
simply
to
visit
a
church
here
a
castle
there
to
rise
at
four
in
the
morning
at
the
summons
of
a
pitiless
guide
to
see
the
sun
rise
from
rigi
or
etna
to
pass
like
a
phantom
already
dead
through
the
world
of
living
shades
called
men
to
know
not
where
to
rest
to
know
no
land
in
which
to
take
root
no
arm
on
which
to
lean
no
heart
in
which
to
pour
your
own
well
last
night
my
dear
roland
suddenly
in
an
instant
in
a
second
this
void
in
my
life
was
filled
i
lived
in
you
the
joys
i
seek
were
yours
the
family
which
i
never
had
i
saw
smiling
around
you
as
i
looked
at
your
mother
i
said
to
myself
my
mother
was
like
that
i
am
looking
at
your
sister
i
said
had
i
a
sister
i
could
not
have
wished
her
when
i
embraced
your
brother
i
thought
that
i
too
might
have
had
a
child
of
that
age
and
thus
leave
something
behind
me
in
the
world
whereas
with
the
nature
i
know
i
possess
i
shall
die
as
i
have
lived
sad
surly
with
others
a
burden
to
myself
ah
you
are
happy
roland
you
have
a
family
you
have
fame
you
have
youth
you
have
that
which
spoils
nothing
in
a
man
you
have
beauty
you
want
no
joys
you
are
not
deprived
of
a
single
delight
i
repeat
it
roland
you
are
a
happy
man
most
happy
good
said
roland
you
forget
my
aneurism
my
sir
john
looked
at
roland
incredulously
roland
seemed
to
enjoy
the
most
perfect
health
your
aneurism
against
my
million
roland
said
lord
tanlay
with
a
feeling
of
profound
sadness
providing
that
with
this
aneurism
you
give
me
this
mother
who
weeps
for
joy
on
seeing
you
again
this
sister
who
faints
with
delight
at
your
return
this
child
who
clings
upon
your
neck
like
some
fresh
young
fruit
to
a
sturdy
young
tree
this
château
with
its
dewy
shade
its
river
with
its
verdant
flowering
banks
these
blue
vistas
dotted
with
pretty
villages
and
belfries
graceful
as
swans
i
would
welcome
your
aneurism
roland
and
with
death
in
two
years
in
one
in
six
months
but
six
months
of
stirring
tender
eventful
and
glorious
life
roland
laughed
in
his
usual
nervous
manner
ah
said
he
so
this
is
the
tourist
the
superficial
traveller
the
wandering
jew
of
civilization
who
pauses
nowhere
gauges
nothing
judges
everything
by
the
sensation
it
produces
in
him
the
tourist
who
without
opening
the
doors
of
these
abodes
where
dwell
the
fools
we
call
men
says
behind
these
walls
is
happiness
well
my
dear
friend
you
see
this
charming
river
don
t
you
these
flowering
meadows
these
pretty
villages
it
is
the
picture
of
peace
innocence
and
fraternity
the
cycle
of
saturn
the
golden
age
returned
it
is
eden
paradise
well
all
that
is
peopled
by
beings
who
have
flown
at
each
other
s
throats
the
jungles
of
calcutta
the
sedges
of
bengal
are
inhabited
by
tigers
and
panthers
not
one
whit
more
ferocious
or
cruel
than
the
denizens
of
these
pretty
villages
these
dewy
lawns
and
these
charming
shores
after
lauding
in
funeral
celebrations
the
good
the
great
the
immortal
marat
whose
body
thank
god
they
cast
into
the
common
sewer
like
carrion
that
he
was
and
always
had
been
after
performing
these
funeral
rites
to
which
each
man
brought
an
urn
into
which
he
shed
his
tears
behold
our
good
bressans
our
gentle
bressans
these
suddenly
decided
that
the
republicans
were
all
murderers
so
they
murdered
them
by
the
tumbrelful
to
correct
them
of
that
vile
defect
common
to
savage
and
civilized
man
the
killing
his
kind
you
doubt
it
my
dear
fellow
on
the
road
to
they
will
show
you
if
you
are
curious
the
spot
where
not
six
months
ago
they
organized
a
slaughter
fit
to
turn
the
stomach
of
our
most
ferocious
troopers
on
the
battlefield
picture
to
yourself
a
tumbrel
of
prisoners
on
their
way
to
it
was
a
cart
one
of
those
immense
wagons
in
which
they
take
cattle
to
market
there
were
some
thirty
men
in
this
tumbrel
whose
sole
crime
was
foolish
exaltation
of
thought
and
threatening
language
they
were
bound
and
gagged
heads
hanging
jolted
by
the
bumping
of
the
cart
their
throats
parched
with
thirst
despair
and
terror
unfortunate
beings
who
did
not
even
have
as
in
the
times
of
nero
and
commodus
the
fight
in
the
arena
the
struggle
with
death
powerless
motionless
the
lust
of
massacre
surprised
them
in
their
fetters
and
battered
them
not
only
in
life
but
in
death
their
bodies
when
their
hearts
had
ceased
to
beat
still
resounded
beneath
the
bludgeons
which
mangled
their
flesh
and
crushed
their
bones
while
women
looked
on
in
calm
delight
lifting
high
the
children
who
clapped
their
hands
for
joy
old
men
who
ought
to
have
been
preparing
for
a
christian
death
helped
by
their
goading
cries
to
render
the
death
of
these
wretched
beings
more
wretched
still
and
in
the
midst
of
these
old
men
a
little
septuagenarian
dainty
powdered
flicking
his
lace
shirt
frill
if
a
speck
of
dust
settled
there
pinching
his
spanish
tobacco
from
a
golden
with
a
diamond
monogram
eating
his
amber
sugarplums
from
a
sevres
bonbonnière
given
him
by
madame
du
barry
and
adorned
with
the
donor
s
portrait
this
septuagenarian
conceive
the
picture
my
dear
sir
john
dancing
with
his
pumps
upon
that
mattress
of
human
flesh
wearying
his
arm
enfeebled
by
age
in
striking
repeatedly
with
his
cane
those
of
the
bodies
who
seemed
not
dead
enough
to
him
not
properly
mangled
in
that
cursed
mortar
faugh
my
friend
i
have
seen
montebello
i
have
seen
arcole
i
have
seen
rivoli
i
have
seen
the
pyramids
and
i
believe
i
could
see
nothing
more
terrible
well
my
mother
s
mere
recital
last
night
after
you
had
retired
of
what
has
happened
here
made
my
hair
stand
on
end
faith
that
explains
my
poor
sister
s
spasms
just
as
my
aneurism
explains
sir
john
watched
roland
and
listened
with
that
strange
wonderment
which
his
young
friend
s
misanthropical
outbursts
always
aroused
roland
seemed
to
lurk
in
the
niches
of
a
conversation
in
order
to
fall
upon
mankind
whenever
he
found
an
opportunity
perceiving
the
impression
he
had
made
on
sir
john
s
mind
he
changed
his
tone
substituting
bitter
raillery
for
his
philanthropic
wrath
it
is
true
said
he
that
apart
from
this
excellent
aristocrat
who
finished
what
the
butchers
had
begun
and
dyed
in
blood
the
red
heels
of
his
pumps
the
people
who
performed
these
massacres
belonged
to
the
lower
classes
bourgeois
and
clowns
as
our
ancestors
called
those
who
supported
them
the
nobles
manage
things
much
more
daintily
for
the
rest
you
saw
yourself
what
happened
at
avignon
if
you
had
been
told
that
you
would
never
have
believed
it
would
you
those
gentlemen
pillagers
of
stage
coaches
pique
themselves
on
their
great
delicacy
they
have
two
faces
not
counting
their
mask
sometimes
they
are
cartouche
and
mandrin
sometimes
amadis
and
galahad
they
tell
fabulous
tales
of
these
heroes
of
the
highways
my
mother
told
me
yesterday
of
one
called
laurent
you
understand
my
dear
fellow
that
laurent
is
a
fictitious
name
meant
to
hide
the
real
name
just
as
a
mask
hides
the
face
this
laurent
combined
all
the
qualities
of
a
hero
of
romance
all
the
accomplishments
as
you
english
say
who
under
pretext
that
you
were
once
normans
allow
yourselves
occasionally
to
enrich
your
language
with
a
picturesque
expression
or
some
word
which
has
long
poor
beggar
asked
and
been
refused
admittance
of
our
own
scholars
this
laurent
was
ideally
handsome
he
was
one
of
companions
of
jehu
who
have
lately
been
tried
at
seventy
were
acquitted
he
and
one
other
were
the
only
ones
condemned
to
death
the
innocent
men
were
released
at
once
but
laurent
and
his
companion
were
put
in
prison
to
await
the
guillotine
but
pooh
master
laurent
had
too
pretty
a
head
to
fall
under
the
executioner
s
ignoble
knife
the
judges
who
condemned
him
the
curious
who
expected
to
witness
him
executed
had
forgotten
what
montaigne
calls
the
corporeal
recommendation
of
beauty
there
was
a
woman
belonging
to
the
jailer
of
his
daughter
sister
or
niece
history
for
it
is
history
and
not
romance
that
i
am
telling
you
history
does
not
say
which
at
all
events
the
woman
whoever
she
was
fell
in
love
with
the
handsome
prisoner
so
much
in
love
that
two
hours
before
the
execution
just
as
master
laurent
expecting
the
executioner
was
sleeping
or
pretending
to
sleep
as
usually
happens
in
such
cases
his
guardian
angel
came
to
him
i
don
t
know
how
they
managed
for
the
two
lovers
for
the
best
of
reasons
never
told
the
details
but
the
truth
is
now
remember
sir
john
that
this
is
truth
and
not
fiction
that
laurent
was
free
but
to
his
great
regret
unable
to
save
his
comrade
in
the
adjoining
dungeon
gensonné
under
like
circumstances
refused
to
escape
preferring
to
die
with
the
other
girondins
but
gensonné
did
not
have
the
head
of
antinous
on
the
body
of
apollo
the
handsomer
the
head
you
understand
the
more
one
holds
on
to
it
so
laurent
accepted
the
freedom
offered
him
and
escaped
a
horse
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
next
village
the
young
girl
who
might
have
retarded
or
hindered
his
flight
was
to
rejoin
him
the
next
day
dawn
came
but
not
the
guardian
angel
it
seems
that
our
hero
cared
more
for
his
mistress
than
he
did
for
his
companion
he
left
his
comrade
but
he
would
not
go
without
her
it
was
six
o
clock
the
very
hour
for
his
execution
his
impatience
mastered
him
three
times
had
he
turned
his
horse
s
head
toward
the
town
and
each
time
drew
nearer
and
nearer
at
the
third
time
a
thought
flashed
through
his
brain
could
his
mistress
have
been
taken
and
would
she
pay
the
penalty
for
saving
him
he
was
then
in
the
suburbs
spurring
his
horse
he
entered
the
town
with
face
uncovered
dashed
through
people
who
called
him
by
name
astonished
to
see
him
free
and
on
horseback
when
they
expected
to
see
him
bound
and
in
a
tumbrel
on
his
way
to
be
executed
catching
sight
of
his
guardian
angel
pushing
through
the
crowd
not
to
see
him
executed
but
to
meet
him
he
urged
his
horse
past
the
executioner
who
had
just
learned
of
the
disappearance
of
one
of
his
patients
knocking
over
two
or
three
bumpkins
with
the
breast
of
his
bayard
he
bounded
toward
her
swung
her
over
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
and
with
a
cry
of
joy
and
a
wave
of
his
hat
he
disappeared
like
de
condé
at
the
battle
of
lens
the
people
all
applauded
and
the
women
thought
the
action
heroic
and
all
promptly
fell
in
love
with
the
hero
on
the
roland
observing
that
sir
john
was
silent
paused
and
questioned
him
by
a
look
go
on
replied
the
englishman
i
am
listening
and
as
i
am
sure
you
are
telling
me
all
this
in
order
to
come
to
something
you
wish
to
say
i
await
your
well
resumed
roland
laughing
you
are
right
my
dear
friend
and
on
my
word
you
know
me
as
if
we
had
been
college
chums
well
what
idea
do
you
suppose
has
been
cavorting
through
my
brain
all
night
it
is
that
of
getting
a
glimpse
of
these
gentlemen
of
jehu
near
at
ah
yes
i
understand
as
you
failed
to
get
yourself
killed
by
de
barjols
you
want
to
try
your
chance
of
being
killed
by
or
any
other
my
dear
sir
john
replied
the
young
officer
calmly
for
i
assure
you
that
i
have
nothing
in
particular
against
morgan
quite
the
contrary
though
my
first
impulse
when
he
came
into
the
room
and
made
his
little
speech
don
t
you
call
it
a
speech
sir
john
nodded
affirmatively
though
my
first
thought
resumed
roland
was
to
spring
at
his
throat
and
strangle
him
with
one
hand
and
to
tear
off
his
mask
with
the
now
that
i
know
you
my
dear
roland
i
do
indeed
wonder
how
you
refrained
from
putting
such
a
fine
project
into
it
was
not
my
fault
i
swear
i
was
just
on
the
point
of
it
when
my
companion
stopped
so
there
are
people
who
can
restrain
you
not
many
but
he
and
now
you
regret
it
honestly
no
this
brave
did
the
business
with
such
swaggering
bravado
that
i
admired
him
i
love
brave
men
instinctively
had
i
not
killed
de
barjols
i
should
have
liked
to
be
his
friend
it
is
true
i
could
not
tell
how
brave
he
was
until
i
had
killed
him
but
let
us
talk
of
something
else
that
duel
is
one
of
my
painful
thoughts
but
why
did
i
come
up
it
was
certainly
not
to
talk
of
the
companions
of
jehu
nor
of
laurent
s
exploits
ah
i
came
to
ask
how
you
would
like
to
spend
your
time
i
ll
cut
myself
in
quarters
to
amuse
you
my
dear
guest
but
there
are
two
disadvantages
against
me
this
region
which
is
not
very
amusing
and
your
nationality
which
is
not
easily
i
have
already
told
you
roland
replied
lord
tanlay
offering
his
hand
to
the
young
man
that
i
consider
the
château
des
a
agreed
but
still
in
the
fear
that
you
may
find
your
paradise
monotonous
i
shall
do
my
best
to
entertain
you
are
you
fond
of
archeology
westminster
and
canterbury
we
have
a
marvel
here
the
church
of
brou
a
wonder
of
sculptured
lace
by
colonban
there
is
a
legend
about
it
which
i
will
tell
you
some
evening
when
you
can
not
sleep
you
will
see
there
the
tombs
of
marguerite
de
bourbon
philippe
le
bel
and
marguerite
of
austria
i
will
puzzle
you
with
the
problem
of
her
motto
fortune
infortune
fort
une
which
i
claim
to
have
solved
by
a
latinized
version
fortuna
in
fortuna
forti
are
you
fond
of
fishing
my
dear
friend
there
s
the
reissouse
at
your
feet
and
close
at
hand
a
collection
of
hooks
and
lines
belonging
to
edouard
and
nets
belonging
to
michel
as
for
the
fish
they
you
know
are
the
last
thing
one
thinks
about
are
you
fond
of
hunting
the
forest
of
seillon
is
not
a
hundred
yards
off
hunting
to
hounds
you
will
have
perforce
to
renounce
but
we
have
good
shooting
in
the
days
of
my
old
bogies
the
chartreuse
monks
the
woods
swarmed
with
wild
boars
hares
and
foxes
no
one
hunts
there
now
because
it
belongs
to
the
government
and
the
government
at
present
is
nobody
in
my
capacity
as
general
bonaparte
s
i
ll
fill
the
vacancy
and
we
ll
see
who
dares
meddle
with
me
if
after
chasing
the
austrians
on
the
adige
and
the
mamelukes
on
the
nile
i
hunt
the
boars
and
deer
and
the
hares
and
foxes
on
the
reissouse
one
day
of
archeology
one
day
of
fishing
and
one
of
hunting
that
s
three
already
you
see
my
dear
fellow
we
have
only
fifteen
or
sixteen
left
to
worry
my
dear
roland
said
sir
john
sadly
and
without
replying
to
the
young
officer
s
wordy
sally
won
t
you
ever
tell
me
about
this
fever
which
sears
you
this
sorrow
which
undermines
you
ah
said
roland
with
his
harsh
doleful
laugh
i
have
never
been
gayer
than
i
am
this
morning
it
s
your
liver
my
lord
that
is
out
of
order
and
makes
you
see
everything
some
day
i
hope
to
be
really
your
friend
replied
sir
john
seriously
then
you
will
confide
in
me
and
i
shall
help
you
to
bear
your
and
half
my
aneurism
are
you
hungry
my
lord
why
do
you
ask
because
i
hear
edouard
on
the
stairs
coming
up
to
tell
us
that
breakfast
is
as
roland
spoke
the
door
opened
and
the
boy
burst
out
big
brother
roland
mother
and
sister
amélie
are
waiting
breakfast
for
sir
john
and
then
catching
the
englishman
s
right
hand
he
carefully
examined
the
first
joint
of
the
thumb
and
forefinger
what
are
you
looking
at
my
little
friend
asked
sir
john
i
was
looking
to
see
if
you
had
any
ink
on
your
and
if
i
had
ink
on
my
fingers
what
would
it
mean
that
you
had
written
to
england
and
sent
for
my
pistols
and
no
i
have
not
yet
written
said
sir
john
but
i
will
you
hear
big
brother
roland
i
m
to
have
my
sword
and
my
pistols
in
a
fortnight
and
the
boy
full
of
delight
offered
his
firm
rosy
cheek
to
sir
john
who
kissed
it
as
tenderly
as
a
father
would
have
done
then
they
went
to
the
where
madame
de
montrevel
and
amélie
were
awaiting
them
chapter
xii
provincial
pleasures
that
same
day
roland
put
into
execution
part
of
his
plans
for
his
guest
s
amusement
he
took
sir
john
to
see
the
church
of
brou
those
who
have
seen
the
charming
little
chapel
of
brou
know
that
it
is
known
as
one
of
the
hundred
marvels
of
the
renaissance
those
who
have
not
seen
it
must
have
often
heard
it
said
roland
who
had
counted
on
doing
the
honors
of
this
historic
gem
to
sir
john
and
who
had
not
seen
it
for
the
last
seven
or
eight
years
was
much
disappointed
when
on
arriving
in
front
of
the
building
he
found
the
niches
of
the
saints
empty
and
the
carved
figures
of
the
portal
decapitated
he
asked
for
the
sexton
people
laughed
in
his
face
there
was
no
longer
a
sexton
he
inquired
to
whom
he
should
go
for
the
keys
they
replied
that
the
captain
of
the
gendarmerie
had
them
the
captain
was
not
far
off
for
the
cloister
adjoining
the
church
had
been
converted
into
a
barrack
roland
went
up
to
the
captain
s
room
and
made
himself
known
as
bonaparte
s
the
captain
with
the
placid
obedience
of
a
subaltern
to
his
superior
officer
gave
him
the
keys
and
followed
behind
him
sir
john
was
waiting
before
the
porch
admiring
in
spite
of
the
mutilation
to
which
they
had
been
subjected
the
admirable
details
of
the
frontal
roland
opened
the
door
and
started
back
in
astonishment
the
church
was
literally
stuffed
with
hay
like
a
cannon
charged
to
the
muzzle
what
does
this
mean
he
asked
the
captain
of
the
gendarmerie
a
precaution
taken
by
the
a
precaution
taken
by
the
municipality
for
what
to
save
the
church
they
were
going
to
demolish
it
but
the
mayor
issued
a
decree
declaring
that
in
expiation
of
the
false
worship
for
which
it
had
served
it
should
be
used
to
store
roland
burst
out
laughing
and
turning
to
sir
john
he
said
my
dear
sir
john
the
church
was
well
worth
seeing
but
i
think
what
this
gentleman
has
just
told
us
is
no
less
curious
you
can
always
find
at
strasburg
cologne
or
milan
churches
or
cathedrals
to
equal
the
chapel
of
brou
but
where
will
you
find
an
administration
idiotic
enough
to
destroy
such
a
masterpiece
and
a
mayor
clever
enough
to
turn
it
into
a
barn
a
thousand
thanks
captain
here
are
your
as
i
was
saying
at
avignon
the
first
time
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
my
dear
roland
replied
sir
john
the
french
are
a
most
amusing
this
time
my
lord
you
are
too
polite
replied
roland
idiotic
is
the
word
listen
i
can
understand
the
political
cataclysms
which
have
convulsed
society
for
the
last
thousand
years
i
can
understand
the
communes
the
pastorals
the
jacquerie
the
maillotins
the
saint
bartholomew
the
league
the
fronde
the
dragonnades
the
revolution
i
can
understand
the
of
july
the
and
of
october
the
of
june
the
of
august
the
and
of
september
the
of
january
the
of
may
the
of
october
and
the
thermidor
i
can
understand
the
egregious
torch
of
civil
wars
which
inflames
instead
of
soothing
the
blood
i
can
understand
the
tidal
wave
of
revolution
sweeping
on
with
its
flux
that
nothing
can
arrest
and
its
reflux
which
carries
with
it
the
ruins
of
the
institution
which
it
has
itself
shattered
i
can
understand
all
that
but
lance
against
lance
sword
against
sword
men
against
men
a
people
against
a
people
i
can
understand
the
deadly
rage
of
the
victors
the
sanguinary
reaction
of
the
vanquished
the
political
volcanoes
which
rumble
in
the
bowels
of
the
globe
shake
the
earth
topple
over
thrones
upset
monarchies
and
roll
heads
and
crowns
on
the
scaffold
but
what
i
can
not
understand
is
this
mutilation
of
the
granite
this
placing
of
monuments
beyond
the
pale
of
the
law
the
destruction
of
inanimate
things
which
belong
neither
to
those
who
destroy
them
nor
to
the
epoch
in
which
they
are
destroyed
this
pillage
of
the
gigantic
library
where
the
antiquarian
can
read
the
archeological
history
of
a
country
oh
the
vandals
the
barbarians
worse
than
that
the
idiots
who
revenge
the
borgia
crimes
and
the
debauches
of
louis
xv
on
stone
how
well
those
pharaohs
menæs
and
cheops
knew
man
as
the
most
perversive
destructive
and
evil
of
animals
they
who
built
their
pyramids
not
with
carved
traceries
nor
lacy
spires
but
with
solid
blocks
of
granite
fifty
feet
square
how
they
must
have
laughed
in
the
depths
of
those
sepulchres
as
they
watched
time
dull
its
scythe
and
pashas
wear
out
their
nails
in
vain
against
them
let
us
build
pyramids
my
dear
sir
john
they
are
not
difficult
as
architecture
nor
beautiful
as
art
but
they
are
solid
and
that
enables
a
general
to
say
four
thousand
years
later
soldiers
from
the
apex
of
these
monuments
forty
centuries
are
watching
you
on
my
honor
my
lord
i
long
to
meet
a
windmill
this
moment
that
i
might
tilt
against
and
roland
bursting
into
his
accustomed
laugh
dragged
sir
john
in
the
direction
of
the
château
but
sir
john
stopped
him
and
asked
is
there
nothing
else
to
see
in
the
city
except
the
church
formerly
my
lord
replied
roland
before
they
made
a
of
it
i
should
have
asked
you
to
come
down
with
me
into
the
vaults
of
the
dukes
of
savoy
we
could
have
hunted
for
that
subterranean
passage
nearly
three
miles
long
which
is
said
to
exist
there
and
which
according
to
these
rumors
communicates
with
the
grotto
of
ceyzeriat
please
observe
i
should
never
offer
such
a
pleasure
trip
except
to
an
englishman
it
would
have
been
like
a
scene
from
your
celebrated
anne
radcliffe
in
the
mysteries
of
but
as
you
see
that
is
impossible
so
we
will
have
to
be
satisfied
with
our
regrets
where
are
we
going
faith
i
don
t
know
ten
years
ago
i
should
have
taken
you
to
the
farms
where
they
fatten
pullets
the
pullets
of
bresse
you
must
know
have
a
european
reputation
bourg
was
an
annex
to
the
great
coop
of
strasburg
but
during
the
terror
as
you
can
readily
imagine
these
fatteners
of
poultry
shut
up
shop
you
earned
the
reputation
of
being
an
aristocrat
if
you
ate
a
pullet
and
you
know
the
fraternal
refrain
ah
ça
ira
ça
ira
the
aristocrats
to
the
lantern
after
robespierre
s
downfall
they
opened
up
again
but
since
the
of
fructidor
france
has
been
commanded
to
fast
from
fowls
and
all
never
mind
come
on
anyway
in
default
of
pullets
i
can
show
you
one
thing
the
square
where
they
executed
those
who
ate
them
but
since
i
was
last
in
the
town
the
streets
have
changed
their
names
i
know
the
way
but
i
don
t
know
the
look
here
demanded
sir
john
aren
t
you
a
republican
i
not
a
republican
come
come
quite
to
the
contrary
i
consider
myself
an
excellent
republican
i
am
quite
capable
of
burning
off
my
hand
like
mucius
scævola
or
jumping
into
the
gulf
like
curtius
to
save
the
republic
but
i
have
unluckily
a
keen
sense
of
the
ridiculous
in
spite
of
myself
the
absurdity
of
things
catches
me
in
the
side
and
tickles
me
till
i
nearly
die
of
laughing
i
am
willing
to
accept
the
constitution
of
but
when
poor
hérault
de
séchelles
wrote
to
the
superintendent
of
the
national
library
to
send
him
a
copy
of
the
laws
of
minos
so
that
he
could
model
his
constitution
on
that
of
the
isle
of
crete
i
thought
it
was
going
rather
far
and
that
we
might
very
well
have
been
content
with
those
of
lycurgus
i
find
january
february
and
march
mythological
as
they
were
quite
as
good
as
nivose
pluviose
and
ventose
i
can
t
understand
why
when
one
was
called
antoine
or
chrystomome
in
he
should
be
called
brutus
or
cassius
in
here
for
example
my
lord
is
an
honest
street
which
was
called
the
rue
des
halles
market
street
there
was
nothing
indecent
or
aristocratic
about
that
was
there
well
now
it
is
called
just
wait
roland
read
the
inscription
well
now
it
is
called
the
rue
de
la
révolution
here
s
another
which
used
to
be
called
notre
dame
it
is
now
the
rue
du
temple
why
rue
du
temple
probably
to
perpetuate
the
memory
of
that
place
where
the
infamous
simon
tried
to
teach
cobbling
to
the
heir
of
kings
don
t
quarrel
with
me
if
i
am
mistaken
by
one
or
two
now
here
s
a
third
it
was
named
crèvecoeur
a
name
famous
throughout
bresse
burgundy
and
flanders
it
is
now
the
rue
de
la
federation
federation
is
a
fine
thing
but
crèvecoeur
was
a
fine
name
and
then
you
see
it
leads
straight
to
the
place
de
la
guillotine
which
is
in
my
opinion
all
wrong
i
don
t
want
any
streets
that
lead
to
such
places
this
one
has
its
advantages
it
is
only
about
a
hundred
feet
from
the
prison
which
economized
and
still
economizes
the
tumbrel
and
the
horse
of
de
bourg
by
the
way
have
you
noticed
that
the
executioner
remains
noble
and
keeps
his
title
for
the
rest
the
square
is
excellently
arranged
for
spectators
and
my
ancestor
montrevel
whose
name
it
bears
doubtless
foreseeing
its
ultimate
destiny
solved
the
great
problem
still
unsolved
by
the
theatres
of
being
able
to
see
well
from
every
nook
and
corner
if
ever
they
cut
off
my
head
which
considering
the
times
in
which
we
are
living
would
in
no
wise
be
surprising
i
shall
have
but
one
regret
that
of
being
less
and
seeing
less
than
the
others
now
let
us
go
up
these
steps
here
we
are
in
the
place
des
lices
our
revolutionists
left
it
its
name
because
in
all
probability
they
don
t
know
what
it
means
i
don
t
know
much
better
than
they
but
i
think
i
remember
that
a
certain
sieur
d
estavayer
challenged
some
flemish
count
i
don
t
know
who
and
that
the
combat
took
place
in
this
square
now
my
dear
fellow
here
is
the
prison
which
ought
to
give
you
some
idea
of
human
vicissitudes
gil
blas
didn
t
change
his
condition
more
often
than
this
monument
its
purposes
before
cæsar
it
was
a
gaelic
temple
cæsar
converted
it
into
a
roman
fortress
an
unknown
architect
transformed
it
into
a
military
work
during
the
middle
ages
the
knights
of
baye
following
cæsar
s
example
it
into
a
fortress
the
princes
of
savoy
used
it
for
a
residence
the
aunt
of
charles
lived
here
when
she
came
to
visit
her
church
at
brou
which
she
never
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
finished
finally
after
the
treaty
of
lyons
when
bresse
was
returned
to
france
it
was
utilized
both
as
a
prison
and
a
wait
for
me
a
moment
my
lord
if
you
dislike
the
squeaking
of
hinges
and
the
grating
of
bolts
i
have
a
visit
to
pay
to
a
certain
the
grating
of
bolts
and
the
squeaking
of
hinges
is
not
a
very
enlivening
sound
but
no
matter
since
you
were
kind
enough
to
undertake
my
education
show
me
your
very
well
then
come
in
quickly
i
see
a
crowd
of
persons
who
look
as
if
they
want
to
speak
to
in
fact
little
by
little
a
sort
of
rumor
seemed
to
spread
throughout
the
town
people
emerged
from
the
houses
forming
groups
in
the
streets
and
they
all
watched
roland
with
curiosity
he
rang
the
bell
of
the
gate
situated
then
where
it
is
now
but
opening
into
the
prison
yard
a
jailer
opened
it
for
them
ah
ah
so
you
are
still
here
father
courtois
asked
the
young
man
then
turning
to
sir
john
he
added
a
fine
name
for
a
jailer
isn
t
it
my
lord
the
jailer
looked
at
the
young
man
in
amazement
how
is
it
he
asked
through
the
grating
that
you
know
my
name
when
i
don
t
know
yours
good
i
not
only
know
your
name
but
also
your
opinions
you
are
an
old
royalist
père
monsieur
said
the
jailer
terrified
don
t
make
bad
jokes
if
you
please
and
say
what
you
well
my
good
father
courtois
i
would
like
to
visit
the
cell
where
they
put
my
mother
and
sister
madame
and
mademoiselle
ah
exclaimed
the
gatekeeper
so
it
s
you
louis
you
may
well
say
that
i
know
you
what
a
fine
handsome
young
man
you
ve
grown
to
be
do
you
think
so
father
courtois
well
i
can
return
the
compliment
your
daughter
charlotte
is
on
my
word
a
beautiful
girl
charlotte
is
my
sister
s
maid
sir
and
she
is
very
happy
over
it
she
is
better
off
there
than
here
roland
is
it
true
that
you
are
general
bonaparte
s
alas
i
have
that
honor
courtois
you
would
prefer
me
to
be
comte
d
artois
s
or
that
of
le
duc
of
angoulême
oh
do
be
quiet
louis
then
putting
his
lips
to
the
young
man
s
ear
tell
me
is
it
true
what
father
courtois
that
general
bonaparte
passed
through
lyons
yesterday
there
must
be
some
truth
in
the
rumor
for
this
is
the
second
time
that
i
have
heard
it
ah
i
understand
now
these
good
people
who
were
watching
me
so
curiously
apparently
wanted
to
question
me
they
were
like
you
father
courtois
they
want
to
know
what
to
make
of
general
bonaparte
s
do
you
know
what
they
say
louis
still
another
rumor
father
courtois
i
should
think
so
but
they
only
whisper
what
is
it
they
say
that
he
has
come
to
demand
the
throne
of
his
majesty
louis
xviii
from
the
directory
and
the
king
s
return
to
it
and
that
if
citizen
gohier
as
president
doesn
t
give
it
up
of
his
own
accord
he
will
take
it
by
pooh
exclaimed
the
young
officer
with
an
incredulous
air
bordering
on
irony
but
father
courtois
insisted
on
his
news
with
an
affirmative
nod
possibly
said
the
young
man
but
as
for
that
it
s
news
for
me
and
now
that
you
know
me
will
you
open
the
gate
of
course
i
will
i
should
think
so
what
the
devil
am
i
about
and
the
jailer
opened
the
gate
with
an
eagerness
equalling
his
former
reluctance
the
young
man
entered
and
sir
john
followed
him
the
jailer
locked
the
gate
carefully
then
he
turned
followed
by
roland
and
the
englishman
in
turn
the
latter
was
beginning
to
get
accustomed
to
his
young
friend
s
erratic
character
the
spleen
he
saw
in
roland
was
misanthropy
without
the
sulkiness
of
timon
or
the
wit
of
alceste
the
jailer
crossed
the
yard
which
was
separated
from
the
law
courts
by
a
wall
fifteen
feet
high
with
an
opening
let
into
the
middle
of
the
receding
wall
closed
by
a
massive
oaken
door
to
admit
prisoners
without
taking
them
round
by
the
street
the
jailer
we
say
crossed
the
yard
to
a
winding
stairway
in
the
left
angle
of
the
courtyard
which
led
to
the
interior
of
the
prison
if
we
insist
upon
these
details
it
is
because
we
shall
be
obliged
to
return
to
this
spot
later
and
we
do
not
wish
it
to
be
wholly
unfamiliar
to
our
readers
when
that
time
comes
these
steps
led
first
to
the
of
the
prison
that
is
to
say
to
the
porter
s
hall
of
the
lower
from
that
hall
ten
steps
led
down
into
an
inner
court
separated
from
a
third
which
was
that
of
the
prisoners
by
a
wall
similar
to
the
one
we
have
described
only
this
one
had
three
doors
at
the
further
end
of
the
courtyard
a
passage
led
to
the
jailer
s
own
room
which
gave
into
a
second
passage
on
which
were
the
cells
which
were
picturesquely
styled
cages
the
jailer
paused
before
the
first
of
these
cages
and
said
striking
the
door
this
is
where
i
put
madame
your
mother
and
your
sister
so
that
if
the
dear
ladies
wanted
either
charlotte
or
myself
they
need
but
is
there
any
one
in
the
cell
no
one
then
please
open
the
door
my
friend
lord
tanlay
is
a
philanthropic
englishman
who
is
travelling
about
to
see
if
the
french
prisons
are
more
comfortable
than
the
english
ones
enter
sir
père
courtois
having
opened
the
door
roland
pushed
sir
john
into
a
perfectly
square
cell
measuring
ten
or
twelve
feet
each
way
oh
oh
exclaimed
sir
john
this
is
do
you
think
so
well
my
dear
friend
this
is
where
my
mother
the
noblest
woman
in
the
world
and
my
sister
whom
you
know
spent
six
weeks
with
a
prospect
of
leaving
it
only
to
make
the
trip
to
the
place
de
bastion
just
think
that
was
five
years
ago
so
my
sister
was
scarcely
but
what
crime
had
they
committed
oh
a
monstrous
crime
at
the
anniversary
festival
with
which
the
town
of
bourg
considered
proper
to
commemorate
the
death
of
the
friend
of
the
people
my
mother
refused
to
permit
my
sister
to
represent
one
of
the
virgins
who
bore
the
tears
of
france
in
vases
what
will
you
poor
woman
she
thought
she
had
done
enough
for
her
country
in
giving
it
the
blood
of
her
son
and
her
husband
which
was
flowing
in
italy
and
germany
she
was
mistaken
her
country
as
it
seems
claimed
further
the
tears
of
her
daughter
she
thought
that
too
much
especially
as
those
tears
were
to
flow
for
the
citizen
marat
the
result
was
that
on
the
very
evening
of
the
celebration
during
the
enthusiastic
exaltation
my
mother
was
declared
accused
fortunately
bourg
had
not
attained
the
celerity
of
paris
a
friend
of
ours
an
official
in
the
kept
the
affair
dragging
until
one
fine
day
the
fall
and
death
of
robespierre
were
made
known
that
interrupted
a
good
many
things
among
others
the
guillotinades
our
friend
convinced
the
authorities
that
the
wind
blowing
from
paris
had
veered
toward
clemency
they
waited
fifteen
days
and
on
the
sixteenth
they
told
my
mother
and
sister
that
they
were
free
so
you
understand
my
friend
and
this
involves
the
most
profound
philosophical
reflection
so
that
if
mademoiselle
teresa
cabarrus
had
not
come
from
spain
if
she
had
not
married
fontenay
parliamentary
counsellor
had
she
not
been
arrested
and
brought
before
the
tallien
son
of
the
marquis
de
bercy
s
butler
s
clerk
of
a
to
the
commune
of
paris
temporarily
at
bordeaux
and
had
the
not
become
enamored
of
her
and
had
she
not
been
imprisoned
and
if
on
the
ninth
of
thermidor
she
had
not
found
means
to
send
a
dagger
with
these
words
unless
the
tyrant
dies
i
die
had
not
been
arrested
in
the
midst
of
his
discourse
had
not
robespierre
on
that
day
had
a
frog
in
his
throat
had
not
garnier
de
l
aube
exclaimed
it
is
the
blood
of
danton
choking
you
had
not
louchet
shouted
for
his
arrest
had
he
not
been
arrested
released
by
the
commune
recaptured
in
spite
of
this
had
his
jaw
broken
by
a
pistol
shot
and
been
executed
next
day
my
mother
would
in
all
probability
have
had
her
head
cut
off
for
refusing
to
allow
her
daughter
to
weep
for
citizen
marat
in
one
of
the
twelve
lachrymal
urns
which
bourg
was
desirous
of
filling
with
its
tears
courtois
you
are
a
worthy
man
you
gave
my
mother
and
sister
a
little
water
to
put
with
their
wine
a
little
meat
to
eat
with
their
bread
a
little
hope
to
fill
their
hearts
you
lent
them
your
daughter
that
they
might
not
have
to
sweep
their
cell
themselves
that
deserves
a
fortune
unfortunately
i
am
not
rich
but
here
are
fifty
louis
i
happen
to
have
with
me
come
my
and
the
young
man
carried
off
sir
john
before
the
jailer
recovered
from
his
surprise
and
found
time
either
to
thank
roland
or
refuse
the
fifty
louis
which
it
must
be
said
would
have
been
a
remarkable
proof
of
disinterestedness
in
a
jailer
especially
when
that
jailer
s
opinions
were
opposed
to
those
of
the
government
he
served
leaving
the
prison
roland
and
sir
john
found
the
place
des
lices
crowded
with
people
who
had
heard
of
general
bonaparte
s
return
to
france
and
were
shouting
vive
bonaparte
at
the
top
of
their
lungs
some
because
they
really
admired
the
victor
of
arcola
rivoli
and
the
pyramids
others
because
they
had
been
told
like
père
courtois
that
this
same
victor
had
vanquished
only
that
louis
xviii
might
profit
by
his
victories
roland
and
sir
john
having
now
visited
all
that
the
town
of
bourg
offered
of
interest
returned
to
the
château
des
which
they
reached
before
long
madame
de
montrevel
and
amélie
had
gone
out
roland
installed
sir
john
in
an
easy
chair
asking
him
to
wait
a
few
minutes
for
him
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
he
returned
with
a
sort
of
pamphlet
of
gray
paper
very
badly
printed
in
his
hand
my
dear
fellow
said
he
you
seemed
to
have
some
doubts
about
the
authenticity
of
that
festival
which
i
just
mentioned
and
which
nearly
cost
my
mother
and
sister
their
lives
so
i
bring
you
the
programme
read
it
and
while
you
are
doing
so
i
will
go
and
see
what
they
have
been
doing
with
my
dogs
for
i
presume
that
you
would
rather
hold
me
quit
of
our
fishing
expedition
in
favor
of
a
he
went
out
leaving
in
sir
john
s
hands
a
copy
of
the
decree
of
the
municipality
of
the
town
of
bourg
instituting
the
funeral
rites
in
honor
of
marat
on
the
anniversary
of
his
death
chapter
xiii
the
sir
john
was
just
finishing
that
interesting
bit
of
history
when
madame
de
montrevel
and
her
daughter
returned
amélie
who
did
not
know
how
much
had
been
said
about
her
between
roland
and
sir
john
was
astounded
by
the
expression
with
which
that
gentleman
scrutinized
her
to
him
she
seemed
more
lovely
than
before
he
could
readily
understand
that
mother
who
at
the
risk
of
life
had
been
unwilling
that
this
charming
creature
should
profane
her
youth
and
beauty
by
serving
as
a
mourner
in
a
celebration
of
which
marat
was
the
deity
he
recalled
that
cold
damp
cell
which
he
had
lately
visited
and
shuddered
at
the
thought
that
this
delicate
white
ermine
before
his
eyes
had
been
imprisoned
there
without
sun
or
air
for
six
weeks
he
looked
at
the
throat
too
long
perhaps
but
in
its
suppleness
and
graceful
in
its
exaggeration
and
he
remembered
that
melancholy
remark
of
the
poor
princesse
de
lamballe
as
she
felt
her
slender
neck
it
will
not
give
the
executioner
much
trouble
the
thoughts
which
succeeded
each
other
in
sir
john
s
mind
gave
to
his
face
an
expression
so
different
from
its
customary
aspect
that
madame
de
montrevel
could
not
refrain
from
asking
what
troubled
him
he
then
told
her
of
his
visit
to
the
prison
and
roland
s
pious
pilgrimage
to
the
dungeon
where
his
mother
and
sister
had
been
incarcerated
just
as
sir
john
had
concluded
his
tale
a
sounded
without
and
roland
entered
his
in
his
hands
my
dear
friend
he
cried
thanks
to
my
mother
we
shall
have
a
splendid
hunt
thanks
to
me
queried
madame
de
montrevel
how
so
added
sir
john
i
left
you
to
see
about
my
dogs
didn
t
i
you
said
so
at
any
i
had
two
excellent
beasts
barbichon
and
ravaude
male
and
oh
exclaimed
sir
john
are
they
dead
well
yes
but
just
guess
what
this
excellent
mother
of
mine
has
done
and
tilting
madame
de
montrevel
s
head
he
kissed
her
on
both
cheeks
she
wouldn
t
let
them
drown
a
single
puppy
because
they
were
the
dogs
of
my
dogs
so
the
result
is
that
the
pups
and
of
barbichon
and
ravaude
are
as
numerous
as
the
descendant
of
ishmael
instead
of
a
pair
of
dogs
i
have
a
whole
pack
beasts
all
as
black
as
moles
with
white
paws
fire
in
their
eyes
and
hearts
and
a
regiment
of
that
would
do
you
good
to
and
roland
sounded
another
halloo
that
brought
his
young
brother
to
the
scene
oh
shouted
the
boy
as
he
entered
you
are
going
hunting
brother
roland
i
m
going
too
i
m
going
too
good
said
roland
but
do
you
know
what
we
are
going
to
hunt
no
all
i
know
is
that
i
m
going
we
re
going
to
hunt
a
oh
joy
cried
the
boy
clapping
his
little
hands
are
you
crazy
asked
madame
de
montrevel
turning
pale
why
so
madame
mother
if
you
please
because
boar
hunts
are
very
not
so
dangerous
as
hunting
men
my
brother
got
back
safe
from
that
and
so
will
i
from
the
roland
cried
madame
de
montrevel
while
amélie
lost
in
thought
took
no
part
in
the
discussion
roland
make
edouard
listen
to
reason
tell
him
that
he
hasn
t
got
but
roland
who
recognized
himself
again
in
his
young
brother
instead
of
blaming
him
smiled
at
his
boyish
ardor
i
d
take
you
willingly
said
he
only
to
go
hunting
one
must
at
least
know
how
to
handle
a
oh
master
roland
cried
edouard
just
come
into
the
garden
a
bit
put
up
your
hat
at
a
hundred
yards
and
i
ll
show
you
how
to
handle
a
naughty
child
exclaimed
madame
de
montrevel
trembling
where
did
you
learn
why
from
the
gunsmith
at
montagnac
who
keeps
papa
s
and
roland
s
guns
you
ask
me
sometimes
what
i
do
with
my
money
don
t
you
well
i
buy
powder
and
balls
with
it
and
i
am
learning
to
kill
austrians
and
arabs
like
my
brother
madame
de
montrevel
raised
her
hands
to
heaven
what
can
you
expect
mother
asked
roland
blood
will
tell
no
montrevel
could
be
afraid
of
powder
you
shall
come
with
us
the
boy
sprang
upon
his
brother
s
neck
and
i
said
sir
john
will
equip
you
like
a
regular
huntsman
just
as
they
used
to
arm
the
knights
of
old
i
have
a
charming
little
rifle
that
i
will
give
you
it
will
keep
you
contented
until
your
sabre
and
pistols
well
asked
roland
are
you
satisfied
now
edouard
yes
but
when
will
he
give
it
to
me
if
you
have
to
write
to
england
for
it
i
warn
you
i
shan
t
believe
in
no
my
little
friend
we
have
only
to
go
up
to
my
room
and
open
my
that
s
soon
then
let
s
go
at
come
on
said
sir
john
and
he
went
out
followed
by
edouard
a
moment
later
amélie
still
absorbed
in
thought
rose
and
left
the
room
neither
madame
de
montrevel
nor
roland
noticed
her
departure
so
interested
were
they
in
a
serious
discussion
madame
de
montrevel
tried
to
persuade
roland
not
to
take
his
young
brother
with
him
on
the
morrow
s
hunt
roland
explained
that
since
edouard
was
to
become
a
soldier
like
his
father
and
brother
the
sooner
he
learned
to
handle
a
gun
and
become
familiar
with
powder
and
ball
the
better
the
discussion
was
not
yet
ended
when
edouard
returned
with
his
gun
slung
over
his
shoulder
look
brother
said
he
turning
to
roland
just
see
what
a
fine
present
sir
john
has
given
and
he
looked
gratefully
at
sir
john
who
stood
in
the
doorway
vainly
seeking
amélie
with
his
eyes
it
was
in
truth
a
beautiful
present
the
rifle
designed
with
that
plainness
of
ornament
and
simplicity
of
form
peculiar
to
english
weapons
was
of
the
finest
finish
like
the
pistols
of
which
roland
had
had
opportunity
to
test
the
accuracy
the
rifle
was
made
by
the
celebrated
manton
and
carried
a
calibre
bullet
that
it
had
been
originally
intended
for
a
woman
was
easily
seen
by
the
shortness
of
the
stock
and
the
velvet
pad
on
the
trigger
this
original
purpose
of
the
weapon
made
it
peculiarly
suitable
for
a
boy
of
twelve
roland
took
the
rifle
from
his
brother
s
shoulder
looked
at
it
knowingly
tried
its
action
sighted
it
tossed
it
from
one
hand
to
the
other
and
then
giving
it
back
to
edouard
said
thank
sir
john
again
you
have
a
rifle
fit
for
a
king
s
son
let
s
go
and
try
all
three
went
out
to
try
sir
john
s
rifle
leaving
madame
de
montrevel
as
sad
as
thetis
when
she
saw
achilles
in
his
woman
s
garb
draw
the
sword
of
ulysses
from
its
scabbard
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
edouard
returned
triumphantly
he
brought
his
mother
a
bit
of
pasteboard
of
the
circumference
of
a
hat
in
which
he
had
put
ten
bullets
out
of
twelve
the
two
men
had
remained
behind
in
the
park
conversing
madame
de
montrevel
listened
to
edouard
s
slightly
boastful
account
of
his
prowess
then
she
looked
at
him
with
that
deep
and
holy
sorrow
of
mothers
to
whom
fame
is
no
compensation
for
the
blood
it
sheds
oh
ungrateful
indeed
is
the
child
who
has
seen
that
look
bent
upon
him
and
does
not
eternally
remember
it
then
after
a
few
seconds
of
this
painful
contemplation
she
pressed
her
second
son
to
her
breast
and
murmured
sobbing
you
too
you
too
will
desert
your
mother
some
yes
mother
replied
the
boy
to
become
a
general
like
my
father
or
an
like
and
to
be
killed
as
your
father
was
as
your
brother
perhaps
will
for
the
strange
transformation
in
roland
s
character
had
not
escaped
madame
de
montrevel
it
was
but
an
added
dread
to
her
other
anxieties
among
which
amélie
s
pallor
and
abstraction
must
be
numbered
amélie
was
just
seventeen
her
childhood
had
been
that
of
a
happy
laughing
girl
joyous
and
healthy
the
death
of
her
father
had
cast
a
black
veil
over
her
youth
and
gayety
but
these
tempests
of
spring
pass
rapidly
her
smile
the
sunshine
of
life
s
dawn
returned
like
that
of
nature
sparkling
through
that
dew
of
the
heart
we
call
tears
then
one
day
about
six
months
before
this
story
opens
amélie
s
face
had
saddened
her
cheeks
had
grown
pale
and
like
the
birds
who
migrate
at
the
approach
of
wintry
weather
the
childlike
laughter
that
escaped
her
parted
lips
and
white
teeth
had
fled
never
to
return
madame
de
montrevel
had
questioned
her
but
amélie
asserted
that
she
was
still
the
same
she
endeavored
to
smile
but
as
a
stone
thrown
into
a
lake
rings
upon
the
surface
so
the
smiles
roused
by
this
maternal
solicitude
faded
little
by
little
from
amélie
s
face
with
keen
maternal
instinct
madame
de
montrevel
had
thought
of
love
but
whom
could
amélie
love
there
were
no
visitors
at
the
château
des
the
political
troubles
had
put
an
end
to
all
society
and
amélie
went
nowhere
alone
madame
de
montrevel
could
get
no
further
than
conjecture
roland
s
return
had
given
her
a
moment
s
hope
but
this
hope
fled
as
soon
as
she
perceived
the
effect
which
this
event
had
produced
upon
amélie
it
was
not
a
sister
but
a
spectre
it
will
be
recalled
who
had
come
to
meet
him
since
her
son
s
arrival
madame
de
montrevel
had
not
lost
sight
of
amélie
and
she
perceived
with
dolorous
amazement
that
roland
s
presence
awakened
a
feeling
akin
to
terror
in
his
sister
s
breast
she
whose
eyes
had
formerly
rested
so
lovingly
upon
him
now
seemed
to
view
him
with
alarm
only
a
few
moments
since
amélie
had
profited
by
the
first
opportunity
to
return
to
her
room
the
one
spot
in
the
château
where
she
seemed
at
ease
and
where
for
the
last
six
months
she
had
spent
most
of
her
time
the
alone
possessed
the
power
to
bring
her
from
it
and
even
then
she
waited
for
the
second
call
before
entering
the
roland
and
sir
john
as
we
have
said
had
divided
their
time
between
their
visit
to
bourg
and
their
preparations
for
the
morrow
s
hunt
from
morn
until
noon
they
were
to
beat
the
woods
from
noon
till
evening
they
were
to
hunt
the
boar
michel
that
devoted
poacher
confined
to
his
chair
for
the
present
with
a
sprain
felt
better
as
soon
as
the
question
of
the
hunt
was
mooted
and
had
himself
hoisted
on
a
little
horse
that
was
used
for
the
errands
of
the
house
then
he
sallied
forth
to
collect
the
beaters
from
and
montagnac
he
being
unable
to
beat
or
run
was
to
remain
with
the
pack
and
watch
sir
john
s
and
roland
s
horse
and
edouard
s
pony
in
the
middle
of
the
forest
where
it
was
intersected
by
one
good
road
and
two
practicable
paths
the
beaters
who
could
not
follow
the
hunt
were
to
return
to
the
château
with
the
the
beaters
were
at
the
door
at
six
the
following
morning
michel
was
not
to
leave
with
the
horses
and
dogs
until
eleven
the
château
des
was
just
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
of
seillon
so
the
hunt
could
begin
at
its
very
gates
as
the
battue
promised
chiefly
deer
and
hares
the
guns
were
loaded
with
balls
roland
gave
edouard
a
simple
little
gun
which
he
himself
had
used
as
a
child
he
had
not
enough
confidence
as
yet
in
the
boy
s
prudence
to
trust
him
with
a
gun
as
for
the
rifle
that
sir
john
had
given
him
the
day
before
it
could
only
carry
cartridges
it
was
given
into
michel
s
safe
keeping
to
be
returned
to
him
in
case
they
started
a
boar
for
the
second
part
of
the
hunt
for
this
roland
and
sir
john
were
also
to
change
their
guns
for
rifles
and
hunting
knives
pointed
as
daggers
and
sharp
as
razors
which
formed
part
of
sir
john
s
arsenal
and
could
be
suspended
from
the
belt
or
screwed
on
the
point
of
the
gun
like
bayonets
from
the
beginning
of
the
battue
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
hunt
would
be
a
good
one
a
roebuck
and
two
hares
were
killed
at
once
at
noon
two
does
seven
roebucks
and
two
foxes
had
been
bagged
they
had
also
seen
two
boars
but
these
latter
had
only
shaken
their
bristles
in
answer
to
the
heavy
balls
and
made
off
edouard
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
he
had
killed
a
roebuck
the
beaters
well
rewarded
for
their
labor
were
sent
to
the
château
with
the
game
as
had
been
arranged
a
sort
of
bugle
was
sounded
to
ascertain
michel
s
whereabout
to
which
he
answered
in
less
than
ten
minutes
the
three
hunters
had
rejoined
the
gardener
with
his
hounds
and
horses
michel
had
seen
a
boar
which
he
had
sent
his
son
to
head
off
and
it
was
now
in
the
woods
not
a
hundred
paces
distant
jacques
michel
s
eldest
son
beat
up
the
woods
with
barbichon
and
ravaude
the
heads
of
the
pack
and
in
about
five
minutes
the
boar
was
found
in
his
lair
they
could
have
killed
him
at
once
or
at
least
shot
at
him
but
that
would
have
ended
the
hunt
too
quickly
the
huntsmen
launched
the
whole
pack
at
the
animal
which
seeing
this
troop
of
pygmies
swoop
down
upon
him
started
off
at
a
slow
trot
he
crossed
the
road
roland
giving
the
and
headed
in
the
direction
of
the
chartreuse
of
seillon
the
three
riders
following
the
path
which
led
through
the
woods
the
boar
led
them
a
chase
which
lasted
until
five
in
the
afternoon
turning
upon
his
tracks
evidently
unwilling
to
leave
the
forest
with
its
thick
undergrowth
at
last
the
violent
barking
of
the
dogs
warned
them
that
the
animal
had
been
brought
to
bay
the
spot
was
not
a
hundred
paces
distant
from
the
pavilion
belonging
to
the
chartreuse
in
one
of
the
most
tangled
thickets
of
the
forest
it
was
impossible
to
force
the
horses
through
it
and
the
riders
dismounted
the
barking
of
the
dogs
guided
them
straight
along
the
path
from
which
they
deviated
only
where
the
obstacles
they
encountered
rendered
it
necessary
from
time
to
time
yelps
of
pain
indicated
that
members
of
the
attacking
party
had
ventured
too
close
to
the
animal
and
had
paid
the
price
of
their
temerity
about
twenty
feet
from
the
scene
of
action
the
hunters
began
to
see
the
actors
the
boar
was
backed
against
a
rock
to
avoid
attack
in
the
rear
then
bracing
himself
on
his
forepaws
he
faced
the
dogs
with
his
ensanguined
eyes
and
enormous
tusks
they
quivered
around
him
like
a
moving
carpet
five
or
six
more
or
less
badly
wounded
were
staining
the
battlefield
with
their
blood
though
still
attacking
the
boar
with
a
fury
and
courage
that
might
have
served
as
an
example
to
the
bravest
men
each
hunter
faced
the
scene
with
the
characteristic
signs
of
his
age
nature
and
nation
edouard
at
one
and
the
same
time
the
most
imprudent
and
the
smallest
finding
the
path
less
difficult
owing
to
his
small
stature
arrived
first
roland
heedless
of
danger
of
any
kind
seeking
rather
than
avoiding
it
followed
finally
sir
john
slower
graver
more
reflective
brought
up
the
rear
once
the
boar
perceived
his
hunters
he
paid
no
further
attention
to
the
dogs
he
fixed
his
gleaming
sanguinary
eyes
upon
them
but
his
only
movement
was
a
snapping
of
the
jaws
which
he
brought
together
with
a
threatening
sound
roland
watched
the
scene
for
an
instant
evidently
desirous
of
flinging
himself
into
the
midst
of
the
group
knife
in
hand
to
slit
the
boar
s
throat
as
a
butcher
would
that
of
a
calf
or
a
pig
this
impulse
was
so
apparent
that
sir
john
caught
his
arm
and
little
edouard
exclaimed
oh
brother
let
me
shoot
the
boar
roland
restrained
himself
and
stacking
his
gun
against
a
tree
waited
armed
only
with
his
which
he
had
drawn
from
its
sheath
very
well
said
he
shoot
him
but
be
careful
about
oh
don
t
worry
retorted
the
child
between
his
set
teeth
his
face
was
pale
but
resolute
as
he
aimed
the
barrel
of
his
rifle
at
the
animal
s
head
if
he
misses
him
or
only
wounds
him
observed
sir
john
you
know
that
the
brute
will
be
upon
us
before
we
can
see
him
through
the
i
know
it
my
lord
but
i
am
accustomed
to
these
hunts
replied
roland
his
nostrils
quivering
his
eyes
sparkling
his
lips
parted
fire
edouard
the
shot
followed
the
order
upon
the
instant
but
after
the
shot
with
or
even
before
it
the
beast
swift
as
lightning
rushed
upon
the
child
a
second
shot
followed
the
first
but
the
animal
s
scarlet
eyes
still
gleamed
through
the
smoke
but
as
it
rushed
it
met
roland
with
his
knee
on
the
ground
the
knife
in
his
hand
a
moment
later
a
tangled
formless
group
man
and
boar
boar
and
man
was
rolling
on
the
ground
then
a
third
shot
rang
out
followed
by
a
laugh
from
roland
ah
my
lord
cried
the
young
man
you
ve
wasted
powder
and
shot
can
t
you
see
that
i
have
ripped
him
up
only
get
his
body
off
of
me
the
beast
weighs
at
least
four
hundred
pounds
and
he
is
smothering
but
before
sir
john
could
stoop
roland
with
a
vigorous
push
of
the
shoulder
rolled
the
animal
s
body
aside
and
rose
to
his
feet
covered
with
blood
but
without
a
single
scratch
little
edouard
either
from
lack
of
time
or
from
native
courage
had
not
recoiled
an
inch
true
he
was
completely
protected
by
his
brother
s
body
which
was
between
him
and
the
boar
sir
john
had
sprung
aside
to
take
the
animal
in
the
flank
he
watched
roland
as
he
emerged
from
this
second
duel
with
the
same
amazement
that
he
had
experienced
after
the
first
the
dogs
those
that
were
left
some
twenty
in
all
had
followed
the
boar
and
were
now
leaping
upon
his
body
in
the
vain
effort
to
tear
the
bristles
which
were
almost
as
impenetrable
as
iron
you
will
see
said
roland
wiping
the
blood
from
his
face
and
hands
with
a
fine
cambric
handkerchief
how
they
will
eat
him
and
your
knife
too
my
true
said
sir
john
where
is
the
knife
in
its
sheath
replied
roland
ah
exclaimed
the
boy
only
the
handle
he
sprang
toward
the
animal
and
pulled
out
the
poniard
which
as
he
said
was
buried
up
to
the
hilt
the
sharp
point
guided
by
a
calm
eye
and
a
firm
hand
had
pierced
the
animal
s
heart
there
were
other
wounds
on
the
boar
s
body
the
first
caused
by
the
boy
s
shot
showed
a
bloody
furrow
just
over
the
eye
the
blow
had
been
too
weak
to
crush
the
frontal
bone
the
second
came
from
sir
john
s
first
shot
it
had
caught
the
animal
diagonally
and
grazed
his
breast
the
third
fired
at
close
quarters
went
through
the
body
but
as
roland
had
said
not
until
after
the
animal
was
dead
chapter
xiv
an
unpleasant
commission
the
hunt
was
over
darkness
was
falling
and
it
was
now
a
question
of
returning
to
the
château
the
horses
were
nearby
they
could
hear
them
neighing
impatiently
they
seemed
to
be
asking
if
their
courage
was
so
doubted
that
they
were
not
allowed
to
share
in
the
exciting
drama
edouard
was
bent
upon
dragging
the
boar
after
them
fastening
it
to
the
and
so
carrying
it
back
to
the
château
but
roland
pointed
out
that
it
was
simpler
to
send
a
couple
of
men
for
it
with
a
barrow
sir
john
being
of
the
same
opinion
edouard
who
never
ceased
pointing
to
the
wound
in
the
head
and
saying
that
s
my
shot
that
s
where
i
aimed
edouard
we
say
was
forced
to
yield
to
the
majority
the
three
hunters
soon
reached
the
spot
where
their
horses
were
tethered
mounted
and
in
less
than
ten
minutes
were
at
the
château
des
madame
de
montrevel
was
watching
for
them
on
the
portico
the
poor
mother
had
waited
there
nearly
an
hour
trembling
lest
an
accident
had
befallen
one
or
the
other
of
her
sons
the
moment
edouard
espied
her
he
put
his
pony
to
a
gallop
shouting
from
the
gate
mother
mother
we
killed
a
boar
as
big
as
a
donkey
i
shot
him
in
the
head
you
ll
see
the
hole
my
ball
made
roland
stuck
his
hunting
knife
into
the
boar
s
belly
up
to
the
hilt
and
sir
john
fired
at
him
twice
quick
quick
send
the
men
for
the
carcass
don
t
be
frightened
when
you
see
roland
he
s
all
covered
with
blood
but
it
s
from
the
boar
and
he
hasn
t
a
this
was
delivered
with
edouard
s
accustomed
volubility
while
madame
de
montrevel
was
crossing
the
clearing
between
the
portico
and
the
road
to
open
the
gate
she
intended
to
take
edouard
in
her
arms
but
he
jumped
from
his
saddle
and
flung
himself
upon
her
neck
roland
and
sir
john
came
up
just
then
and
amélie
appeared
on
the
portico
at
the
same
instant
edouard
left
his
mother
to
worry
over
roland
who
covered
as
he
was
with
blood
looked
very
terrifying
and
rushed
to
his
sister
with
the
tale
he
had
rattled
off
to
his
mother
amélie
listened
in
an
abstracted
manner
that
probably
hurt
edouard
s
vanity
for
he
dashed
off
to
the
kitchen
to
describe
the
affair
to
michel
who
was
certain
to
listen
to
him
michel
was
indeed
interested
but
when
after
telling
him
where
the
carcass
lay
edouard
gave
him
roland
s
order
to
send
a
couple
of
men
after
the
beast
he
shook
his
head
what
demanded
edouard
are
you
going
to
refuse
to
obey
my
brother
heaven
forbid
master
edouard
jacques
shall
start
this
instant
for
are
you
afraid
he
won
t
find
any
body
goodness
no
he
could
get
a
dozen
but
the
trouble
is
the
time
of
night
you
say
the
boar
lies
close
to
the
pavilion
of
the
chartreuse
not
twenty
yards
from
i
d
rather
it
was
three
miles
replied
michel
scratching
his
head
but
never
mind
i
ll
send
for
them
anyway
without
telling
them
what
they
re
wanted
for
once
here
it
s
for
your
brother
to
make
them
good
good
only
get
them
here
and
i
ll
see
to
that
oh
exclaimed
michel
if
i
hadn
t
this
beastly
sprain
i
d
go
myself
but
s
doings
have
made
it
worse
jacques
jacques
jacques
came
and
edouard
not
only
waited
to
hear
the
order
given
but
until
he
had
started
then
he
ran
upstairs
to
do
what
roland
and
sir
john
were
already
doing
that
is
dress
for
dinner
the
whole
talk
at
table
as
may
be
easily
imagined
centred
upon
the
day
s
prowess
edouard
asked
nothing
better
than
to
talk
about
it
and
sir
john
astounded
by
roland
s
skill
courage
and
good
luck
improved
upon
the
child
s
narrative
madame
de
montrevel
shuddered
at
each
detail
and
yet
she
made
them
repeat
it
twenty
times
that
which
seemed
most
clear
to
her
in
all
this
was
that
roland
had
saved
edouard
s
life
did
you
thank
him
for
it
she
asked
the
boy
thank
whom
your
why
should
i
thank
him
retorted
edouard
i
should
have
done
the
same
ah
madame
what
can
you
expect
said
sir
john
you
are
a
gazelle
who
has
unwittingly
given
birth
to
a
race
of
amélie
had
also
paid
the
closest
attention
to
the
account
especially
when
the
hunters
spoke
of
their
proximity
to
the
chartreuse
from
that
time
on
she
listened
with
anxious
eyes
and
seemed
scarcely
to
breathe
until
they
told
of
leaving
the
woods
after
the
killing
after
dinner
word
was
brought
that
jacques
had
returned
with
two
peasants
from
montagnac
they
wanted
exact
directions
as
to
where
the
hunters
had
left
the
animal
roland
rose
intending
to
go
to
them
but
madame
de
montrevel
who
could
never
see
enough
of
her
son
turned
to
the
messenger
and
said
bring
these
worthy
men
in
here
it
is
not
necessary
to
disturb
roland
for
five
minutes
later
the
two
peasants
entered
twirling
their
hats
in
their
hands
my
sons
said
roland
i
want
you
to
fetch
the
boar
we
killed
in
the
forest
of
that
can
be
done
said
one
of
the
peasants
consulting
his
companion
with
a
look
yes
it
can
be
done
answered
the
other
don
t
be
alarmed
said
roland
you
shall
lose
nothing
by
your
oh
we
re
not
interrupted
one
of
the
peasants
we
know
you
monsieur
de
yes
answered
the
other
we
know
that
like
your
father
you
re
not
in
the
habit
of
making
people
work
for
nothing
oh
if
all
the
aristocrats
had
been
like
you
monsieur
louis
there
wouldn
t
have
been
any
of
course
not
said
the
other
who
seemed
to
have
come
solely
to
echo
affirmatively
what
his
companion
said
it
remains
to
be
seen
now
where
the
animal
is
said
the
first
peasant
yes
repeated
the
second
remains
to
be
seen
where
it
oh
it
won
t
be
hard
to
so
much
the
better
interjected
the
peasant
do
you
know
the
pavilion
in
the
forest
which
one
yes
which
one
the
one
that
belongs
to
the
chartreuse
of
the
peasants
looked
at
each
other
well
you
ll
find
it
some
twenty
feet
distant
from
the
front
on
the
way
to
the
peasants
looked
at
each
other
once
more
hum
grunted
the
first
one
hum
repeated
the
other
faithful
echo
of
his
companion
well
what
does
this
hum
mean
demanded
roland
confound
come
explain
yourselves
what
s
the
matter
the
matter
is
that
we
d
rather
that
it
was
the
other
end
of
the
but
why
the
other
end
retorted
roland
impatiently
it
s
nine
miles
from
here
to
the
other
end
and
barely
three
from
here
to
where
we
left
the
yes
said
the
first
peasant
but
just
where
the
boar
lies
and
he
paused
and
scratched
his
head
exactly
that
s
what
added
the
other
just
what
it
s
a
little
too
near
the
not
the
chartreuse
i
said
the
it
s
all
the
same
you
know
monsieur
louis
that
there
is
an
underground
passage
leading
from
the
pavilion
to
the
oh
yes
there
is
one
that
s
sure
added
the
other
but
exclaimed
roland
what
has
this
underground
passage
got
to
do
with
our
boar
this
much
that
the
beast
s
in
a
bad
place
that
s
oh
yes
a
bad
place
repeated
the
other
peasant
come
now
explain
yourselves
you
rascals
said
roland
who
was
growing
angry
while
his
mother
seemed
uneasy
and
amélie
visibly
turned
pale
beg
pardon
monsieur
louis
answered
the
peasant
we
are
not
rascals
we
re
men
that
s
by
thunder
cried
roland
i
m
a
man
myself
what
of
that
well
we
don
t
care
to
have
any
dealings
with
the
no
no
no
asserted
the
second
peasant
a
man
can
match
a
man
if
he
s
of
his
own
kind
continued
the
first
peasant
sometimes
two
said
the
second
who
was
built
like
a
hercules
but
with
ghostly
beings
phantoms
spectres
no
thank
you
continued
the
first
peasant
no
thank
you
repeated
the
other
oh
mother
sister
queried
roland
addressing
the
two
women
in
heaven
s
name
do
you
understand
anything
of
what
these
two
fools
are
saying
fools
repeated
the
first
peasant
well
possibly
but
it
s
not
the
less
true
that
pierre
marey
had
his
neck
twisted
just
for
looking
over
the
wall
true
it
was
of
a
saturday
the
devil
s
and
they
couldn
t
straighten
it
out
affirmed
the
second
peasant
so
they
had
to
bury
him
with
his
face
turned
round
looking
the
other
way
oh
exclaimed
sir
john
this
is
growing
interesting
i
m
very
fond
of
ghost
that
s
more
than
sister
amélie
is
it
seems
cried
edouard
what
do
you
mean
just
see
how
pale
she
s
grown
brother
yes
indeed
said
sir
john
mademoiselle
looks
as
if
she
were
going
to
i
not
at
all
exclaimed
amélie
wiping
the
perspiration
from
her
forehead
only
don
t
you
think
it
seems
a
little
warm
here
mother
no
answered
madame
de
montrevel
still
insisted
amélie
if
it
would
not
annoy
you
i
should
like
to
open
the
do
so
my
amélie
rose
hastily
to
profit
by
this
permission
and
went
with
tottering
steps
to
a
window
opening
upon
the
garden
after
it
was
opened
she
stood
leaning
against
the
sill
by
the
curtains
ah
she
said
i
can
breathe
sir
john
rose
to
offer
her
his
but
amélie
declined
hastily
no
no
my
lord
thank
you
but
i
am
better
come
come
said
roland
don
t
bother
about
that
it
s
our
well
monsieur
louis
we
will
fetch
your
boar
that
s
it
said
the
second
peasant
morning
when
it
s
but
to
go
there
at
night
oh
to
go
there
at
night
the
peasant
looked
at
his
comrade
and
both
shook
their
heads
it
can
t
be
done
at
monsieur
louis
a
man
s
not
a
coward
because
he
s
no
indeed
that
s
not
being
a
coward
replied
the
other
ah
said
roland
i
wish
some
stronger
minded
men
than
you
would
face
me
with
that
argument
that
a
man
is
not
a
coward
because
he
s
afraid
well
it
s
according
to
what
he
s
afraid
of
monsieur
louis
give
me
a
good
sickle
and
a
good
cudgel
and
i
m
not
afraid
of
a
wolf
give
me
a
good
gun
and
i
m
not
afraid
of
any
man
even
if
i
knew
he
s
waiting
to
murder
yes
said
edouard
but
you
re
afraid
of
a
ghost
even
when
it
s
only
the
ghost
of
a
little
master
edouard
said
the
peasant
leave
your
brother
to
do
the
talking
you
re
not
old
enough
to
jest
about
such
things
no
added
the
other
peasant
wait
till
your
beard
is
grown
my
little
i
haven
t
any
beard
retorted
edouard
starting
up
but
just
the
same
if
i
was
strong
enough
to
carry
the
boar
i
d
go
fetch
it
myself
either
by
day
or
much
good
may
it
do
you
my
young
gentleman
but
neither
my
comrade
nor
myself
would
go
even
for
a
whole
nor
for
two
said
roland
wishing
to
corner
them
nor
for
two
nor
four
nor
ten
monsieur
de
montrevel
ten
louis
are
good
but
what
could
i
do
with
them
if
my
neck
was
broken
yes
twisted
like
pierre
marey
s
said
the
other
peasant
ten
louis
wouldn
t
feed
my
wife
and
children
for
the
rest
of
my
life
would
they
and
besides
when
you
say
ten
louis
interrupted
the
second
peasant
you
mean
really
five
because
i
d
get
five
so
the
pavilion
is
haunted
by
ghosts
is
it
asked
roland
i
didn
t
say
the
pavilion
i
m
not
sure
about
the
pavilion
but
in
the
chartreuse
in
the
chartreuse
are
you
sure
oh
there
have
you
seen
them
i
haven
t
but
some
folks
has
your
comrade
asked
the
young
officer
turning
to
the
second
peasant
i
haven
t
seen
them
but
i
did
see
flames
and
claude
philippon
heard
ah
so
they
have
flames
and
chains
said
roland
yes
replied
the
first
peasant
for
i
have
seen
the
flames
and
claude
philippon
on
heard
the
chains
repeated
the
other
very
good
my
friends
very
good
replied
roland
sneering
so
you
won
t
go
there
at
any
price
not
at
any
not
for
all
the
gold
in
the
and
you
ll
go
when
it
s
light
oh
monsieur
louis
before
you
re
up
the
boar
will
be
before
you
re
up
said
echo
all
right
said
roland
come
back
to
me
the
day
after
willingly
monsieur
louis
what
do
you
want
us
to
do
never
mind
just
oh
we
ll
that
means
that
the
moment
you
say
come
you
can
count
upon
us
monsieur
well
then
i
ll
have
some
information
for
what
about
the
amélie
gave
a
stifled
cry
madame
de
montrevel
alone
heard
it
louis
dismissed
the
two
peasants
and
they
jostled
each
other
at
the
door
in
their
efforts
to
go
through
together
nothing
more
was
said
that
evening
about
the
chartreuse
or
the
pavilion
nor
of
its
supernatural
tenants
spectres
or
phantoms
who
haunted
them
chapter
xv
the
man
at
ten
o
clock
everyone
was
in
bed
at
the
château
des
or
at
any
rate
all
had
retired
to
their
rooms
three
or
four
times
in
the
course
of
the
evening
amélie
had
approached
roland
as
if
she
had
something
to
say
to
him
but
each
time
the
words
died
upon
her
lips
when
the
family
left
the
salon
she
had
taken
his
arm
and
although
his
room
was
on
the
floor
above
hers
she
had
accompanied
him
to
his
very
door
roland
had
kissed
her
bade
her
and
closed
his
door
declaring
himself
very
tired
nevertheless
in
spite
of
this
assertion
roland
once
alone
did
not
proceed
to
undress
he
went
to
his
collection
of
arms
selected
a
pair
of
magnificent
pistols
manufactured
at
versailles
and
presented
to
his
father
by
the
convention
he
snapped
the
triggers
and
blew
into
the
barrels
to
see
that
there
were
no
old
charges
in
them
they
were
in
excellent
condition
after
which
he
laid
them
side
by
side
on
the
table
then
going
to
the
door
looking
out
upon
the
stairs
he
opened
it
softly
to
see
if
any
one
were
watching
finding
the
corridor
and
stairs
empty
he
went
to
sir
john
s
door
and
knocked
come
in
said
the
englishman
sir
john
like
himself
was
not
prepared
for
bed
i
guessed
from
the
sign
you
made
me
that
you
had
something
to
say
to
me
said
sir
john
so
i
waited
for
you
as
you
indeed
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
returned
roland
seating
himself
gayly
in
an
armchair
my
kind
host
replied
the
englishman
i
am
beginning
to
understand
you
when
i
see
you
as
gay
as
you
are
now
i
am
like
your
peasants
i
feel
did
you
hear
what
they
were
saying
i
heard
them
tell
a
splendid
ghost
story
i
myself
have
a
haunted
castle
in
have
you
ever
seen
the
ghosts
my
lord
yes
when
i
was
little
unfortunately
since
i
have
grown
up
they
have
that
s
always
the
way
with
ghosts
said
roland
gayly
they
come
and
go
how
lucky
it
is
that
i
should
return
just
as
the
ghosts
have
begun
to
haunt
the
chartreuse
of
yes
replied
sir
john
very
lucky
only
are
you
sure
that
there
are
any
there
no
but
i
ll
know
by
the
day
after
how
so
i
intend
to
spend
night
oh
said
the
englishmen
would
you
like
to
have
me
go
with
you
with
pleasure
my
lord
only
unfortunately
that
is
impossible
oh
as
i
have
just
told
you
my
dear
but
why
impossible
are
you
acquainted
with
the
manners
and
customs
of
ghosts
sir
john
asked
roland
gravely
well
i
am
ghosts
only
show
themselves
under
certain
explain
well
for
example
in
italy
my
lord
and
in
spain
the
most
superstitious
of
countries
there
are
no
ghosts
or
if
there
are
why
at
the
best
it
s
only
once
in
ten
or
twenty
years
or
maybe
in
a
and
to
what
do
you
attribute
their
absence
to
the
absence
of
ah
ah
not
a
doubt
of
it
you
understand
the
native
atmosphere
of
ghosts
is
fog
scotland
denmark
and
england
regions
of
fog
are
overrun
with
ghosts
there
s
the
spectre
of
hamlet
then
that
of
banquo
the
shadows
of
richard
iii
italy
has
only
one
spectre
cæsar
and
then
where
did
he
appear
to
brutus
at
philippi
in
macedonia
and
in
thessaly
the
denmark
of
greece
the
scotland
of
the
orient
where
the
fog
made
ovid
so
melancholy
he
named
the
odes
he
wrote
there
tristia
why
did
virgil
make
the
ghost
of
anchises
appear
to
eneas
because
he
came
from
mantua
do
you
know
mantua
a
marsh
a
a
regular
manufactory
of
rheumatism
an
atmosphere
of
vapors
and
consequently
a
nest
of
go
on
i
m
listening
to
have
you
seen
the
rhine
germany
isn
t
it
still
another
country
of
fairies
water
sprites
sylphs
and
consequently
phantoms
for
whoso
does
the
greater
see
can
see
the
less
and
all
that
on
account
of
the
fog
but
where
the
devil
can
the
ghosts
hide
in
italy
and
spain
not
the
least
bit
of
mist
and
therefore
were
i
in
spain
or
italy
i
should
never
attempt
s
but
all
that
doesn
t
explain
why
you
refuse
my
company
insisted
sir
john
wait
a
moment
i
ve
just
explained
to
you
that
ghosts
don
t
venture
into
certain
countries
because
they
do
not
offer
certain
atmospheric
conditions
now
let
me
explain
the
precautions
we
must
take
if
we
wish
to
see
explain
explain
said
sir
john
i
would
rather
hear
you
talk
than
any
other
man
and
sir
john
stretching
himself
out
in
his
prepared
to
listen
with
delight
to
the
improvisations
of
this
fantastic
mind
which
he
had
seen
under
so
many
aspects
during
the
few
days
of
their
acquaintance
roland
bowed
his
head
by
way
of
thanks
well
this
is
the
way
of
it
and
you
will
grasp
it
readily
enough
i
have
heard
so
much
about
ghosts
in
my
life
that
i
know
the
scamps
as
if
i
had
made
them
why
do
ghosts
appear
are
you
asking
me
that
inquired
sir
john
yes
i
ask
i
own
that
not
having
studied
ghosts
as
you
have
i
am
unable
to
give
you
a
definitive
you
see
ghosts
show
themselves
my
dear
fellow
in
order
to
frighten
those
who
see
that
is
of
course
now
if
they
don
t
frighten
those
to
whom
they
appear
they
are
frightened
by
them
witness
de
turenne
whose
ghosts
proved
to
be
counterfeiters
do
you
know
that
story
i
ll
tell
it
to
you
some
day
don
t
let
s
get
mixed
up
that
is
just
why
when
they
decide
to
appear
which
is
seldom
ghosts
select
stormy
nights
when
it
thunders
lightens
and
blows
that
s
their
i
am
forced
to
admit
that
nothing
could
be
more
wait
a
moment
there
are
instances
when
the
bravest
man
feels
a
shudder
run
through
his
veins
even
before
i
was
suffering
with
this
aneurism
it
has
happened
to
me
a
dozen
times
when
i
have
seen
the
flash
of
sabres
and
heard
the
thunder
of
cannon
around
me
it
is
true
that
since
i
have
been
subject
to
this
aneurism
i
rush
where
the
lightning
flashes
and
the
thunder
growls
still
there
is
the
chance
that
these
ghosts
don
t
know
this
and
believe
that
i
can
be
whereas
that
is
an
impossibility
isn
t
it
asked
sir
john
what
will
you
when
right
or
wrong
one
feels
that
far
from
dreading
death
one
has
every
reason
to
seek
it
what
should
he
fear
but
i
repeat
these
ghosts
who
know
so
much
may
not
know
that
only
ghosts
know
this
they
know
that
the
sense
of
fear
increases
or
diminishes
according
to
the
seeing
and
hearing
of
exterior
things
thus
for
example
where
do
phantoms
prefer
to
appear
in
dark
places
cemeteries
old
cloisters
ruins
subterranean
passages
because
the
aspect
of
these
localities
predisposes
the
soul
to
fear
what
precedes
their
appearance
the
rattling
of
chains
groans
sighs
because
there
is
nothing
very
cheerful
in
all
that
they
are
careful
not
to
appear
in
the
bright
light
or
after
a
strain
of
dance
music
no
fear
is
an
abyss
into
which
you
descend
step
by
step
until
you
are
overcome
by
vertigo
your
feet
slip
and
you
plunge
with
closed
eyes
to
the
bottom
of
the
precipice
now
if
you
read
the
accounts
of
all
these
apparitions
you
ll
find
they
all
proceed
like
this
first
the
sky
darkens
the
thunder
growls
the
wind
howls
doors
and
windows
rattle
the
lamp
if
there
is
a
lamp
in
the
room
of
the
person
the
ghosts
are
trying
to
frighten
the
lamp
flares
flickers
and
goes
out
utter
darkness
then
in
the
darkness
groans
wails
and
the
rattling
of
chains
are
heard
then
at
last
the
door
opens
and
the
ghost
appears
i
must
say
that
all
the
apparitions
that
i
have
not
seen
but
read
about
have
presented
themselves
under
similar
circumstances
isn
t
that
so
sir
john
and
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
ghost
appearing
to
two
persons
at
the
same
time
i
certainly
never
did
hear
of
it
s
quite
simple
my
dear
fellow
two
together
you
understand
have
no
fear
fear
is
something
mysterious
strange
independent
of
the
will
requiring
isolation
darkness
and
solitude
a
ghost
is
no
more
dangerous
than
a
cannon
ball
well
a
soldier
never
fears
a
cannon
ball
in
the
daytime
when
his
elbows
touch
a
comrade
to
the
right
and
left
no
he
goes
straight
for
the
battery
and
is
either
killed
or
he
kills
that
s
not
what
the
phantoms
want
that
s
why
they
never
appear
to
two
persons
at
the
same
time
and
that
is
the
reason
i
want
to
go
to
the
chartreuse
alone
my
lord
your
presence
would
prevent
the
boldest
ghost
from
appearing
if
i
see
nothing
or
if
i
see
something
worth
the
trouble
you
can
have
your
turn
the
next
day
does
the
bargain
suit
you
perfectly
but
why
can
t
i
take
the
first
night
ah
first
because
the
idea
didn
t
occur
to
you
and
it
is
only
just
that
i
should
benefit
by
my
own
cleverness
besides
i
belong
to
the
region
i
was
friendly
with
the
good
monks
in
their
lifetime
and
there
may
be
a
chance
of
their
appearing
to
me
after
death
moreover
as
i
know
the
localities
if
it
becomes
necessary
to
run
away
or
pursue
i
can
do
it
better
than
you
don
t
you
see
the
justice
of
that
my
dear
fellow
yes
it
couldn
t
be
fairer
but
i
am
sure
of
going
the
next
the
next
night
and
the
one
after
and
every
day
and
night
if
you
wish
i
only
hold
to
the
first
now
continued
roland
rising
this
is
between
ourselves
isn
t
it
not
a
word
to
any
one
the
ghosts
might
be
forewarned
and
act
accordingly
it
would
never
do
to
let
those
gay
dogs
get
the
best
of
us
that
would
be
too
oh
be
easy
about
that
you
will
go
armed
won
t
you
if
i
thought
i
was
only
dealing
with
ghosts
i
d
go
with
my
hands
in
my
pockets
and
nothing
in
my
fobs
but
as
i
told
you
de
turenne
s
ghosts
were
counterfeiters
so
i
shall
take
my
do
you
want
mine
no
thanks
though
yours
are
good
i
am
about
resolved
never
to
use
them
then
with
a
smile
whose
bitterness
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
he
added
they
brought
me
sir
john
i
must
sleep
soundly
so
as
not
to
want
to
sleep
then
shaking
the
englishman
s
hand
vigorously
a
second
time
he
left
the
room
and
returned
to
his
own
there
he
was
greatly
surprised
to
find
the
door
which
he
was
sure
he
had
left
closed
open
but
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
sight
of
his
sister
explained
the
matter
to
him
hello
he
exclaimed
partly
astonished
partly
uneasy
is
that
you
amélie
yes
it
is
i
she
said
then
going
close
to
her
brother
and
letting
him
kiss
her
forehead
she
added
in
a
supplicating
voice
you
won
t
go
will
you
dear
roland
go
where
asked
roland
to
the
good
who
told
you
that
oh
for
one
who
knows
how
difficult
it
is
to
guess
and
why
don
t
you
want
me
to
go
to
the
chartreuse
i
m
afraid
something
might
happen
to
what
so
you
believe
in
ghosts
do
you
he
asked
looking
fixedly
into
amélie
s
eyes
amélie
lowered
her
glance
and
roland
felt
his
sister
s
hand
tremble
in
his
come
said
roland
amélie
at
least
the
one
i
used
to
know
general
de
montrevel
s
daughter
and
roland
s
sister
is
too
intelligent
to
yield
to
these
vulgar
terrors
it
s
impossible
that
you
can
believe
these
tales
of
apparitions
chains
flames
spectres
and
if
i
did
believe
them
roland
i
should
not
be
so
alarmed
if
ghosts
do
exist
they
must
be
souls
without
bodies
and
consequently
can
not
bring
their
material
hatred
from
the
grave
besides
why
should
a
ghost
hate
you
roland
you
who
never
harmed
any
one
good
you
forget
all
those
i
have
killed
in
war
or
in
amélie
shook
her
head
i
m
not
afraid
of
then
what
are
you
afraid
of
the
young
girl
raised
her
beautiful
eyes
wet
with
tears
to
roland
and
threw
herself
in
his
arms
saying
i
don
t
know
roland
but
i
can
t
help
it
i
am
the
young
man
raised
her
head
which
she
was
hiding
in
his
breast
with
gentle
force
and
said
kissing
her
eyelids
softly
and
tenderly
you
don
t
believe
i
shall
have
ghosts
to
fight
with
do
you
oh
brother
don
t
go
to
the
chartreuse
cried
amélie
eluding
the
question
mother
told
you
to
say
this
to
me
didn
t
she
oh
no
brother
mother
said
nothing
to
me
it
is
i
who
guessed
that
you
intended
to
well
if
i
want
to
go
replied
roland
firmly
you
ought
to
know
amélie
that
i
shall
even
if
i
beseech
you
on
my
knees
brother
cried
amélie
in
a
tone
of
anguish
slipping
down
to
her
brother
s
feet
even
if
i
beseech
you
on
my
knees
oh
women
women
murmured
roland
inexplicable
creatures
whose
words
are
all
mystery
whose
lips
never
tell
the
real
secrets
of
their
hearts
who
weep
and
pray
and
tremble
why
god
knows
but
man
never
i
shall
go
amélie
because
i
have
resolved
to
go
and
when
once
i
have
taken
a
resolution
no
power
on
earth
can
make
me
change
it
now
kiss
me
and
don
t
be
frightened
and
i
will
tell
you
a
amélie
raised
her
head
and
gazed
questioningly
despairingly
at
roland
i
have
known
for
more
than
a
year
replied
the
young
man
that
i
have
the
misfortune
not
to
be
able
to
die
so
reassure
yourself
and
don
t
be
roland
uttered
these
words
so
dolefully
that
amélie
who
had
until
then
kept
her
emotion
under
control
left
the
room
sobbing
the
young
officer
after
assuring
himself
that
her
door
was
closed
shut
his
murmuring
we
ll
see
who
will
weary
first
fate
or
chapter
xvi
the
ghost
the
next
evening
at
about
the
same
hour
the
young
officer
after
convincing
himself
that
every
one
in
the
château
des
had
gone
to
bed
opened
his
door
softly
went
downstairs
holding
his
breath
reached
the
vestibule
slid
back
the
bolts
of
the
outer
door
noiselessly
and
turned
round
to
make
sure
that
all
was
quiet
reassured
by
the
darkened
windows
he
boldly
opened
the
iron
gate
the
hinges
had
probably
been
oiled
that
day
for
they
turned
without
grating
and
closed
as
noiselessly
as
they
had
opened
behind
roland
who
walked
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
pont
d
ain
at
bourg
he
had
hardly
gone
a
hundred
yards
before
the
clock
at
struck
once
that
of
montagnac
answered
like
a
bronze
echo
it
was
ten
o
clock
at
the
pace
the
young
man
was
walking
he
needed
only
twenty
minutes
to
reach
the
chartreuse
especially
if
instead
of
skirting
the
woods
he
took
the
path
that
led
direct
to
the
monastery
roland
was
too
familiar
from
youth
with
every
nook
of
the
forest
of
seillon
to
needlessly
lengthen
his
walk
ten
minutes
he
therefore
turned
unhesitatingly
into
the
forest
coming
out
on
the
other
side
in
about
five
minutes
once
there
he
had
only
to
cross
a
bit
of
open
ground
to
reach
the
orchard
wall
of
the
convent
this
took
barely
another
five
minutes
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
he
stopped
but
only
for
a
few
seconds
he
unhooked
his
cloak
rolled
it
into
a
ball
and
tossed
it
over
the
wall
the
cloak
off
he
stood
in
a
velvet
coat
white
leather
breeches
and
the
coat
was
fastened
round
the
waist
by
a
belt
in
which
were
a
pair
of
pistols
a
hat
covered
his
head
and
shaded
his
face
with
the
same
rapidity
with
which
he
had
removed
his
garment
that
might
have
hindered
his
climbing
the
wall
he
began
to
scale
it
his
foot
readily
found
a
chink
between
the
stones
he
sprang
up
seizing
the
coping
and
was
on
the
other
side
without
even
touching
the
top
of
the
wall
over
which
he
bounded
he
picked
up
his
cloak
threw
it
over
his
shoulder
hooked
it
and
crossed
the
orchard
to
a
little
door
communicating
with
the
cloister
the
clock
struck
eleven
as
he
passed
through
it
roland
stopped
counted
the
strokes
and
slowly
walked
around
the
cloister
looking
and
listening
he
saw
nothing
and
heard
no
noise
the
monastery
was
the
picture
of
desolation
and
solitude
the
doors
were
all
open
those
of
the
cells
the
chapel
and
the
refectory
in
the
refectory
a
vast
hall
where
the
tables
still
stood
in
their
places
roland
noticed
five
or
six
bats
circling
around
a
frightened
owl
flew
through
a
broken
casement
and
perched
upon
a
tree
close
by
hooting
dismally
good
said
roland
aloud
i
ll
make
my
headquarters
here
bats
and
owls
are
the
vanguards
of
the
sound
of
that
human
voice
lifted
in
the
midst
of
this
solitude
darkness
and
desolation
had
something
so
uncanny
so
lugubrious
about
it
that
it
would
have
caused
even
the
speaker
to
shudder
had
not
roland
as
he
himself
said
been
inaccessible
to
fear
he
looked
about
for
a
place
from
which
he
could
command
the
entire
hall
an
isolated
table
placed
on
a
sort
of
stage
at
one
end
of
the
refectory
which
had
no
doubt
been
used
by
the
superior
of
the
convent
to
take
his
food
apart
from
the
monks
to
read
from
pious
books
during
the
repast
seemed
to
roland
best
adapted
to
his
needs
here
backed
by
the
wall
he
could
not
be
surprised
from
behind
and
once
his
eye
grew
accustomed
to
the
darkness
he
could
survey
every
part
of
the
hall
he
looked
for
a
seat
and
found
an
overturned
stool
about
three
feet
from
the
table
probably
the
one
occupied
by
the
reader
or
the
person
dining
there
in
solitude
roland
sat
down
at
the
table
loosened
his
cloak
to
insure
greater
freedom
of
movement
took
his
pistols
from
his
belt
laid
one
on
the
table
and
striking
three
blows
with
the
of
the
other
he
said
in
a
loud
voice
the
meeting
is
open
the
ghosts
can
appear
those
who
have
passed
through
churches
and
cemeteries
at
night
have
often
experienced
without
analyzing
it
the
supreme
necessity
of
speaking
low
and
reverently
which
attaches
to
certain
localities
only
such
persons
can
understand
the
strange
impression
produced
on
any
one
who
heard
it
by
that
curt
mocking
voice
which
now
disturbed
the
solitude
and
the
shadows
it
vibrated
an
instant
in
the
darkness
which
seemed
to
quiver
with
it
then
it
slowly
died
away
without
an
echo
escaping
by
all
the
many
openings
made
by
the
wings
of
time
as
he
had
expected
roland
s
eyes
had
accustomed
themselves
to
the
darkness
and
now
by
the
pale
light
of
the
rising
moon
whose
long
white
rays
penetrated
the
refectory
through
the
broken
windows
he
could
see
distinctly
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
vast
apartment
although
roland
was
as
evidently
without
fear
internally
as
externally
he
was
not
without
distrust
and
his
ear
caught
the
slightest
sounds
he
heard
the
strike
in
spite
of
himself
the
sound
startled
him
for
it
came
from
the
bell
of
the
convent
how
was
it
that
in
this
ruin
where
all
was
dead
a
clock
the
pulse
of
time
was
living
oh
oh
said
roland
that
proves
that
i
shall
see
the
words
were
spoken
almost
in
an
aside
the
majesty
of
the
place
and
the
silence
acted
upon
that
heart
of
iron
firm
as
the
iron
that
had
just
tolled
the
call
of
time
upon
eternity
the
minutes
slowly
passed
one
after
the
other
perhaps
a
cloud
was
passing
between
earth
and
moon
for
roland
fancied
that
the
shadows
deepened
then
as
midnight
approached
he
seemed
to
hear
a
thousand
confused
imperceptible
sounds
coming
no
doubt
from
the
nocturnal
universe
which
wakes
while
the
other
sleeps
nature
permits
no
suspension
of
life
even
for
repose
she
created
her
nocturnal
world
even
as
she
created
her
daily
world
from
the
gnat
which
buzzes
about
the
sleeper
s
pillow
to
the
lion
prowling
around
the
arab
s
bivouac
but
roland
the
camp
watcher
the
sentinel
of
the
desert
roland
the
hunter
the
soldier
knew
all
those
sounds
they
were
powerless
to
disturb
him
then
mingling
with
these
sounds
the
tones
of
the
clock
chiming
the
hour
vibrated
above
his
head
this
time
it
was
midnight
roland
counted
the
twelve
strokes
one
after
the
other
the
last
hung
quivering
upon
the
air
like
a
bird
with
iron
wings
then
slowly
expired
sad
and
mournful
just
then
the
young
man
thought
he
heard
a
moan
he
listened
in
the
direction
whence
it
came
again
he
heard
it
this
time
nearer
at
hand
he
rose
his
hands
resting
upon
the
table
the
of
a
pistol
beneath
each
palm
a
rustle
like
that
of
a
sheet
or
a
gown
trailing
along
the
grass
was
audible
on
his
right
not
ten
paces
from
him
he
straightened
up
as
if
moved
by
a
spring
at
the
same
moment
a
shade
appeared
on
the
threshold
of
the
vast
hall
this
shade
resembled
the
ancient
statues
lying
on
the
tombs
it
was
wrapped
in
an
immense
which
trailed
behind
it
for
an
instant
roland
doubted
his
own
eyes
had
the
preoccupation
of
his
mind
made
him
see
a
thing
which
was
not
was
he
the
dupe
of
his
senses
the
sport
of
those
hallucinations
which
physicians
assert
but
can
not
explain
a
moan
uttered
by
the
phantom
put
his
doubts
to
flight
my
faith
he
cried
in
a
burst
of
laughter
now
for
a
tussle
friend
ghost
the
spectre
paused
and
extended
a
hand
toward
the
young
officer
roland
roland
said
the
spectre
in
a
muffled
voice
it
would
be
a
pity
not
to
follow
to
the
grave
those
you
have
sent
and
the
spectre
without
hastening
its
step
continued
on
its
way
roland
astounded
for
an
instant
came
down
from
the
stage
and
resolutely
followed
the
ghost
the
path
was
difficult
encumbered
with
stones
benches
awry
and
tables
and
yet
through
all
these
obstacles
an
invisible
channel
seemed
open
for
the
spectre
which
pursued
its
way
unchecked
each
time
it
passed
before
a
window
the
light
from
with
out
feeble
as
it
was
shone
upon
the
and
the
ghost
outlining
the
figure
which
passed
into
the
obscurity
to
reappear
and
vanish
again
at
each
succeeding
one
roland
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
figure
fearing
to
lose
sight
of
it
if
he
diverted
his
gaze
from
it
dared
not
look
at
the
path
apparently
so
easy
to
the
spectre
yet
bristling
with
obstacles
for
him
he
stumbled
at
every
step
the
ghost
was
gaining
upon
him
it
reached
the
door
opposite
to
that
by
which
it
had
entered
roland
saw
the
entrance
to
a
dark
passage
feeling
that
the
ghost
would
escape
him
he
cried
man
or
ghost
robber
or
monk
halt
or
i
fire
a
dead
body
can
not
be
killed
twice
and
death
has
no
power
over
the
spirit
replied
the
ghost
in
its
muffled
voice
who
are
you
the
shade
of
him
you
tore
violently
from
the
the
young
officer
burst
into
that
harsh
nervous
laugh
made
more
terrible
by
the
darkness
around
him
faith
said
he
if
you
have
no
further
indications
to
give
me
i
shall
not
trouble
myself
to
discover
remember
the
fountain
at
vaucluse
said
the
shade
in
a
voice
so
faint
the
words
seemed
to
escape
his
lips
like
a
sigh
rather
than
articulate
speech
for
an
instant
roland
felt
not
his
heart
failing
him
but
the
sweat
pouring
from
his
forehead
making
an
effort
over
himself
he
regained
his
voice
and
cried
menacingly
for
a
last
time
apparition
or
reality
i
warn
you
that
if
you
do
not
stop
i
shall
fire
the
shade
did
not
heed
him
but
continued
on
its
way
roland
paused
an
instant
to
take
aim
the
spectre
was
not
ten
paces
from
him
roland
was
a
sure
shot
he
had
himself
loaded
his
pistols
and
only
a
moment
before
he
had
looked
to
the
charge
to
see
that
it
was
intact
as
the
spectre
passed
tall
and
white
beneath
the
gloomy
vault
of
the
passage
roland
fired
the
flash
illumined
the
corridor
like
lightning
down
which
the
spectre
passed
with
unfaltering
unhastening
steps
then
all
was
blacker
than
before
the
ghost
vanished
in
the
darkness
roland
dashed
after
him
changing
his
other
pistol
from
the
left
hand
to
the
right
but
short
as
his
stop
had
been
the
ghost
had
gained
ground
roland
saw
him
at
the
end
of
the
passage
this
time
distinctly
outlined
against
the
gray
background
of
the
night
he
redoubled
his
pace
and
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
passage
he
fancied
that
the
ghost
was
plunging
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
but
the
torso
still
remained
visible
devil
or
not
cried
roland
i
follow
you
he
fired
a
second
shot
which
filled
the
cavernous
space
into
which
the
ghost
had
disappeared
with
flame
and
smoke
when
the
smoke
had
cleared
away
roland
looked
vainly
around
he
was
alone
he
sprang
into
the
cistern
howling
with
rage
he
sounded
the
walls
with
the
of
his
pistol
he
stamped
on
the
ground
but
everywhere
earth
and
stone
gave
back
the
sound
of
solid
objects
he
tried
to
pierce
the
darkness
but
it
was
impossible
the
faint
moonlight
that
filtered
into
the
cistern
died
out
at
the
first
steps
oh
cried
roland
a
torch
a
torch
no
one
answered
the
only
sound
to
be
heard
was
the
spring
bubbling
close
at
hand
realizing
that
further
search
would
be
useless
he
emerged
from
the
cavern
drawing
a
and
two
balls
from
his
pocket
he
loaded
his
pistols
hastily
then
he
took
the
path
along
which
he
had
just
come
found
the
dark
passage
then
the
vast
refectory
and
again
took
his
place
at
the
end
of
the
silent
hall
and
waited
but
the
hours
of
the
night
sounded
successively
until
the
first
gleam
of
dawn
cast
its
pallid
light
upon
the
walls
of
the
cloister
well
muttered
roland
it
s
over
for
perhaps
i
shall
be
more
fortunate
the
next
twenty
minutes
later
he
the
château
des
chapter
xvii
investigations
two
persons
were
waiting
for
roland
s
return
one
in
anguish
the
other
with
impatience
these
two
persons
were
amélie
and
sir
john
neither
of
them
had
slept
for
an
instant
amélie
displayed
her
anguish
only
by
the
sound
of
her
door
which
was
furtively
closed
as
roland
came
up
the
staircase
roland
heard
the
sound
he
had
not
the
courage
to
pass
before
her
door
without
reassuring
her
be
easy
amélie
i
am
here
he
said
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
his
sister
might
be
anxious
for
any
one
but
him
amélie
darted
from
her
room
in
her
it
was
easy
to
see
from
her
pallor
and
the
dark
circles
which
spread
nearly
to
the
middle
of
her
cheeks
that
she
had
not
closed
her
eyes
all
night
has
nothing
happened
to
you
roland
she
cried
clasping
her
brother
in
her
arms
and
feeling
him
over
anxiously
nor
to
any
one
else
and
you
saw
nothing
i
didn
t
say
that
answered
roland
good
god
what
did
you
see
i
ll
tell
that
to
you
later
meantime
there
is
no
one
either
killed
or
ah
i
breathe
again
now
let
me
give
you
a
bit
of
advice
little
sister
go
to
bed
and
sleep
if
you
can
till
breakfast
i
am
going
to
do
the
same
thing
and
can
assure
you
i
won
t
need
any
rocking
or
rather
roland
kissed
his
sister
tenderly
then
affecting
to
whistle
a
carelessly
he
ran
up
the
next
flight
of
steps
sir
john
was
frankly
waiting
for
him
in
the
hall
he
went
straight
to
the
young
man
well
he
asked
well
i
didn
t
roll
my
stone
entirely
for
did
you
see
any
ghosts
at
any
rate
i
saw
something
that
resembled
one
very
come
tell
me
all
about
i
see
you
won
t
be
able
to
sleep
or
at
best
only
fitfully
if
i
don
t
here
s
what
happened
in
a
and
roland
gave
him
a
minute
account
of
the
night
s
adventure
excellent
said
sir
john
when
roland
had
finished
i
hope
you
have
left
something
for
me
to
i
am
even
afraid
answered
roland
that
i
have
left
you
the
hardest
then
as
sir
john
went
over
each
detail
asking
many
questions
about
the
localities
he
said
listen
sir
john
we
will
pay
the
chartreuse
a
visit
in
broad
daylight
after
breakfast
which
will
not
interfere
in
the
least
with
your
on
the
contrary
it
will
acquaint
you
with
the
localities
only
you
must
tell
no
oh
exclaimed
sir
john
do
i
look
like
a
gabbler
no
that
s
true
cried
roland
laughing
you
are
not
a
gabbler
but
i
am
a
so
saying
he
entered
his
bedchamber
after
breakfast
the
two
young
men
sauntered
down
the
slopes
of
the
garden
as
if
to
take
a
walk
along
the
banks
of
the
reissouse
then
they
bore
to
the
left
swung
up
the
hill
for
about
forty
paces
struck
into
the
highroad
and
crossed
the
woods
till
they
reached
the
convent
wall
at
the
very
place
where
roland
had
climbed
over
it
on
the
preceding
night
my
lord
said
roland
this
is
the
very
well
replied
sir
john
let
us
take
slowly
with
a
wonderful
strength
of
wrist
which
betokened
a
man
well
trained
in
gymnastics
the
englishman
seized
the
coping
of
the
wall
swung
himself
to
the
top
and
dropped
down
on
the
other
side
roland
followed
with
the
rapidity
of
one
who
is
not
achieving
a
feat
for
the
first
time
they
were
both
on
the
other
side
where
the
desertion
and
desolation
were
more
visible
by
night
than
by
day
the
grass
was
growing
knee
high
in
the
paths
the
espaliers
were
tangled
with
vines
so
thick
that
the
grapes
could
not
ripen
in
the
shadow
of
the
leaves
the
wall
had
given
way
in
several
places
and
ivy
the
parasite
rather
than
the
friend
of
ruins
was
spreading
everywhere
as
for
the
trees
in
the
open
space
plums
peaches
and
apricots
they
had
grown
with
the
freedom
of
the
oaks
and
beeches
in
the
forest
whose
breadth
and
thickness
they
seemed
to
envy
the
sap
completely
absorbed
by
the
branches
which
were
many
and
vigorous
produced
but
little
fruit
and
that
imperfect
by
the
rustle
of
the
tall
grass
sir
john
and
roland
divined
that
the
lizards
those
crawling
offsprings
of
solitude
had
established
their
domicile
there
from
which
they
fled
in
amazement
at
this
disturbance
roland
led
his
friend
straight
to
the
door
between
the
orchard
and
the
cloister
but
before
entering
he
glanced
at
the
clock
that
clock
which
went
at
night
was
stopped
in
the
day
time
from
the
cloister
he
passed
into
the
refectory
there
the
daylight
showed
under
their
true
aspect
the
various
objects
which
the
darkness
had
clothed
with
such
fantastic
forms
the
night
before
roland
showed
sir
john
the
overturned
stools
the
table
marked
by
the
blow
of
the
pistol
the
door
by
which
the
phantom
had
entered
accompanied
by
the
englishman
he
followed
the
path
he
had
taken
in
pursuit
of
the
spectre
he
recognized
the
obstacles
which
had
hindered
him
and
noted
how
easily
one
who
knew
the
locality
might
cross
or
avoid
them
at
the
spot
where
he
had
fired
he
found
the
wad
but
he
looked
in
vain
for
the
bullet
the
arrangement
of
the
passage
which
ran
slanting
made
it
impossible
for
the
bullet
if
its
marks
were
not
on
the
walls
to
have
missed
the
ghost
and
yet
if
the
ghost
were
hit
supposing
it
to
be
a
solid
body
how
came
it
to
remain
erect
how
had
it
escaped
being
wounded
and
if
wounded
why
were
there
no
bloodstains
on
the
ground
and
there
was
no
trace
of
either
blood
or
ball
sir
john
was
almost
ready
to
admit
that
his
friend
had
had
to
do
with
a
veritable
ghost
some
one
came
after
me
said
roland
and
picked
up
the
but
if
you
fired
at
a
man
why
didn
t
the
ball
go
into
him
oh
that
s
easily
explained
the
man
wore
a
coat
of
mail
under
his
that
was
possible
but
nevertheless
sir
john
shook
his
head
dubiously
he
preferred
to
believe
in
a
supernatural
occurrence
it
gave
him
less
trouble
roland
and
he
continued
their
investigations
they
reached
the
end
of
the
passage
which
opened
on
the
furthest
extremity
of
the
orchard
it
was
there
that
roland
had
seen
his
spectre
for
an
instant
as
it
glided
into
the
dark
vault
he
made
for
the
cistern
and
so
little
did
he
hesitate
that
he
might
still
have
been
following
the
ghost
there
he
understood
how
the
darkness
of
the
night
had
seemed
to
deepen
by
the
absence
of
all
exterior
reflection
it
was
even
difficult
to
see
there
by
day
roland
took
two
torches
about
a
foot
long
from
beneath
his
cloak
took
a
flint
lighted
the
tinder
and
a
match
from
the
tinder
both
torches
flared
up
the
problem
was
now
to
discover
the
way
by
which
the
ghost
had
disappeared
roland
and
sir
john
lowered
their
torches
and
examined
the
ground
the
cistern
was
paved
with
large
squares
of
limestone
which
seemed
to
fit
perfectly
roland
looked
for
his
second
ball
as
persistently
as
for
the
first
a
stone
lay
loose
at
his
feet
and
pushing
it
aside
he
disclosed
an
iron
ring
screwed
into
one
of
the
limestone
blocks
without
a
word
roland
seized
the
ring
braced
his
feet
and
pulled
the
square
turned
on
its
pivot
with
an
ease
which
proved
that
it
was
frequently
subjected
to
the
same
manipulation
as
it
turned
it
disclosed
a
subterranean
passage
ah
exclaimed
roland
this
is
the
way
my
spectre
he
entered
the
yawning
cavern
followed
by
sir
john
they
traversed
the
same
path
that
morgan
took
when
he
returned
to
give
an
account
of
his
expedition
at
the
end
of
the
passage
they
came
upon
an
iron
gate
opening
into
the
mortuary
vaults
roland
shook
the
gate
which
yielded
to
his
touch
they
crossed
this
subterranean
cemetery
and
came
to
a
second
gate
like
the
first
it
was
open
with
roland
still
in
front
they
went
up
several
steps
and
found
themselves
in
the
choir
of
the
chapel
where
the
scene
we
have
related
between
morgan
and
the
company
of
jehu
took
place
only
now
the
stalls
were
empty
the
choir
was
deserted
and
the
altar
degraded
by
the
abandonment
of
worship
was
no
longer
covered
by
the
burning
tapers
or
the
sacred
cloth
it
was
evident
to
roland
that
this
was
the
goal
of
the
false
ghost
which
sir
john
persisted
in
believing
a
real
one
but
real
or
false
sir
john
admitted
that
its
flight
had
brought
it
to
this
particular
spot
he
reflected
a
moment
and
then
remarked
as
it
is
my
turn
to
watch
tonight
i
have
the
right
to
choose
my
ground
i
shall
watch
and
he
pointed
to
a
sort
of
table
formed
in
the
centre
of
the
choir
by
an
oaken
pedestal
which
had
formerly
supported
the
eagle
lectern
indeed
said
roland
with
the
same
heedlessness
he
showed
in
his
own
affairs
you
ll
do
very
well
there
only
as
you
may
find
the
gates
locked
and
the
stone
fastened
tonight
we
had
better
look
for
some
more
direct
way
to
get
in
less
than
five
minutes
they
had
found
an
outlet
the
door
of
the
old
sacristy
opened
into
the
choir
and
from
the
sacristy
a
broken
window
gave
passage
into
the
forest
the
two
men
climbed
through
the
window
and
found
themselves
in
the
forest
thicket
some
twenty
feet
from
the
spot
where
they
had
killed
the
boar
that
s
what
we
want
said
roland
only
my
dear
sir
john
as
you
would
never
find
your
way
by
night
in
a
forest
which
even
by
day
is
so
impenetrable
i
shall
accompany
you
as
far
as
very
well
but
once
i
am
inside
you
are
to
leave
me
said
the
englishman
i
remember
what
you
told
me
about
the
susceptibility
of
ghosts
if
they
know
you
are
near
they
may
hesitate
to
appear
and
as
you
have
seen
one
i
insist
on
seeing
at
least
one
i
ll
leave
you
don
t
be
afraid
replied
roland
adding
with
a
laugh
only
i
do
fear
one
what
is
that
that
in
your
double
capacity
of
an
englishman
and
a
heretic
they
won
t
feel
at
ease
with
oh
replied
sir
john
gravely
what
a
pity
i
shall
not
have
time
to
abjure
before
this
the
two
friends
having
seen
all
there
was
to
see
returned
to
the
chateau
no
one
not
even
amélie
had
suspected
that
their
walk
was
other
than
an
ordinary
one
the
day
passed
without
questions
and
without
apparent
anxiety
besides
it
was
already
late
when
the
two
gentlemen
returned
at
dinner
to
edouard
s
great
delight
another
hunt
was
proposed
and
it
furnished
a
topic
for
conversation
during
dinner
and
part
of
the
evening
by
ten
o
clock
as
usual
all
had
retired
to
their
rooms
except
roland
who
was
in
that
of
sir
john
the
difference
of
character
showed
itself
markedly
in
the
preparations
of
the
two
men
roland
had
made
them
joyously
as
if
for
a
pleasure
trip
sir
john
made
his
gravely
as
if
for
a
duel
he
loaded
his
pistols
with
the
utmost
care
and
put
them
into
his
belt
english
fashion
and
instead
of
a
cloak
which
might
have
impeded
his
movements
he
wore
a
with
a
high
collar
put
on
over
his
other
coat
at
ten
the
pair
left
the
house
with
the
same
precautions
that
roland
had
observed
when
alone
it
was
five
minutes
before
eleven
when
they
reached
the
broken
window
where
the
fallen
stones
served
as
a
there
according
to
agreement
they
were
to
part
sir
john
reminded
roland
of
this
agreement
yes
said
roland
an
agreement
is
an
agreement
with
me
only
let
me
give
you
a
piece
of
what
is
it
i
could
not
find
the
bullets
because
some
one
had
been
here
and
carried
them
off
and
that
was
done
beyond
doubt
to
prevent
me
from
seeing
the
dents
on
what
sort
of
dent
do
you
mean
those
of
the
links
of
a
coat
of
mail
my
ghost
was
a
man
in
that
s
too
bad
said
sir
john
i
hoped
for
a
then
after
a
moment
s
silence
and
a
sigh
expressive
of
his
deep
regret
in
resigning
the
ghost
he
asked
what
was
your
advice
fire
at
his
face
sir
john
nodded
assent
pressed
the
young
officer
s
hand
clambered
through
the
window
and
disappeared
in
the
sacristy
called
roland
after
him
then
with
the
indifference
to
danger
which
a
soldier
generally
feels
for
himself
and
his
companions
roland
took
his
way
back
to
the
château
des
as
he
had
promised
sir
john
chapter
xviii
the
trial
the
next
day
roland
who
had
been
unable
to
sleep
till
about
two
in
the
morning
woke
about
seven
collecting
his
scattered
wits
he
recalled
what
had
passed
between
sir
john
and
himself
the
night
before
and
was
astonished
that
the
englishman
had
not
wakened
him
he
dressed
hastily
and
went
to
sir
john
s
room
at
the
risk
of
rousing
him
from
his
first
sleep
he
knocked
at
the
door
sir
john
made
no
answer
roland
knocked
again
louder
this
time
the
same
silence
this
time
some
uneasiness
mingled
with
roland
s
curiosity
the
key
was
on
the
outside
the
young
officer
opened
the
door
and
cast
a
rapid
glance
around
the
room
sir
john
was
not
there
he
had
not
returned
the
bed
was
undisturbed
what
had
happened
there
was
not
an
instant
to
lose
and
we
may
be
sure
that
with
that
rapidity
of
decision
we
know
in
roland
he
lost
not
an
instant
he
rushed
to
his
room
finished
dressing
put
his
hunting
knife
into
his
belt
slung
his
rifle
over
his
shoulder
and
went
out
no
one
was
yet
awake
except
the
chambermaid
roland
met
her
on
the
stairs
tell
madame
de
montrevel
said
he
that
i
have
gone
into
the
forest
of
seillon
with
my
gun
she
must
not
worry
if
sir
john
and
i
are
not
on
time
for
then
he
darted
rapidly
away
ten
minutes
later
he
reached
the
window
where
he
had
left
sir
john
the
night
before
he
listened
not
a
sound
came
from
within
the
huntsman
s
ear
could
detect
the
morning
woodland
sounds
but
no
others
roland
climbed
through
the
window
with
his
customary
agility
and
rushed
through
the
choir
into
the
sacristy
one
look
sufficed
to
show
him
that
not
only
the
choir
but
the
entire
chapel
was
empty
had
the
spectres
led
the
englishman
along
the
reverse
of
the
way
he
had
come
himself
possibly
roland
passed
rapidly
behind
the
altar
into
the
vaults
where
he
found
the
gate
open
he
entered
the
subterranean
cemetery
darkness
hid
its
depths
he
called
sir
john
three
times
no
one
answered
he
reached
the
second
gate
it
was
open
like
the
first
he
entered
the
vaulted
passage
only
as
it
would
be
impossible
to
use
his
gun
in
such
darkness
he
slung
it
over
his
shoulder
and
drew
out
his
feeling
his
way
he
continued
to
advance
without
meeting
anybody
but
the
further
he
went
the
deeper
became
the
darkness
which
indicated
that
the
stone
in
the
cistern
was
closed
he
reached
the
steps
and
mounted
them
until
his
head
touched
the
revolving
stone
then
he
made
an
effort
and
the
block
turned
roland
saw
daylight
and
leaped
into
the
cistern
the
door
into
the
orchard
stood
open
roland
passed
through
it
crossed
that
portion
of
the
orchard
which
lay
between
the
cistern
and
the
corridor
at
the
other
end
of
which
he
had
fired
upon
the
phantom
he
passed
along
the
corridor
and
entered
the
refectory
the
refectory
was
empty
again
as
in
the
funereal
passageway
roland
called
three
times
the
wondering
echo
which
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
tones
of
the
human
voice
answered
stammering
it
was
improbable
that
sir
john
had
come
this
way
it
was
necessary
to
go
back
roland
retraced
his
steps
and
found
himself
in
the
choir
again
that
was
where
sir
john
had
intended
to
spend
the
night
and
there
some
trace
of
him
must
be
found
roland
advanced
only
a
short
distance
and
then
a
cry
escaped
him
a
large
spot
of
blood
lay
at
his
feet
staining
the
pavement
on
the
other
side
of
the
choir
a
dozen
feet
from
the
blood
was
another
stain
not
less
large
nor
less
red
nor
less
recent
it
seemed
to
make
a
pendant
for
the
first
one
of
these
stains
was
to
the
right
the
other
to
the
left
of
that
sort
of
pedestal
intended
as
we
have
said
to
support
the
eagle
lectern
the
pedestal
which
sir
john
had
selected
for
his
place
of
waiting
roland
went
up
to
it
it
was
drenched
with
blood
evidently
the
drama
had
taken
place
on
that
spot
a
drama
which
if
all
the
signs
were
true
must
have
been
terrible
roland
in
his
double
capacity
of
huntsman
and
soldier
was
keen
at
a
quest
he
could
calculate
the
amount
of
blood
lost
by
a
man
who
was
dead
or
by
one
who
was
only
wounded
that
night
three
men
had
fallen
either
dead
or
wounded
what
were
the
probabilities
the
two
stains
in
the
choir
to
the
right
and
left
of
the
pedestal
were
probably
the
blood
of
sir
john
s
two
antagonists
that
on
the
pedestal
was
probably
his
own
attacked
on
both
sides
right
and
left
he
had
fired
with
both
hands
killing
or
wounding
a
man
with
each
shot
hence
these
two
bloodstains
which
reddened
the
pavement
he
himself
must
have
been
struck
down
beside
the
pedestal
on
which
his
blood
had
spurted
after
a
few
seconds
of
examination
roland
was
as
sure
of
this
as
if
he
had
witnessed
the
struggle
with
his
own
eyes
now
what
had
been
done
with
the
bodies
he
cared
little
enough
about
two
of
them
but
he
was
determined
to
know
what
had
become
of
that
of
sir
john
a
track
of
blood
started
from
the
pedestal
and
led
straight
to
the
door
sir
john
s
body
had
been
carried
outside
roland
shook
the
massive
door
it
was
only
latched
and
opened
at
the
first
pressure
outside
the
sill
the
tracks
of
blood
still
continued
roland
could
see
through
the
underbrush
the
path
by
which
the
body
had
been
carried
the
broken
branches
the
trampled
grass
led
roland
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
on
the
road
leading
from
pont
d
ain
to
bourg
there
the
body
living
or
dead
seemed
to
have
been
laid
on
the
bank
of
the
ditch
beyond
that
no
traces
whatever
a
man
passed
just
then
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
château
des
roland
went
up
to
him
have
you
seen
anything
on
the
road
did
you
meet
any
one
he
inquired
yes
replied
the
man
i
saw
two
peasants
carrying
a
body
on
a
ah
cried
roland
was
it
that
of
a
living
man
the
man
was
pale
and
motionless
he
looked
as
if
he
were
was
the
blood
flowing
i
saw
some
drops
on
the
in
that
case
he
is
then
taking
a
louis
from
his
pocket
he
said
there
s
a
louis
for
you
run
for
milliet
at
bourg
tell
him
to
get
a
horse
and
come
at
full
speed
to
the
château
des
you
can
add
that
there
is
a
man
there
in
danger
of
while
the
peasant
stimulated
by
the
reward
made
all
haste
to
bourg
roland
leaping
along
on
his
vigorous
legs
was
hurrying
to
the
château
and
now
as
our
readers
are
in
all
probability
as
curious
as
roland
to
know
what
had
happened
to
sir
john
we
shall
give
an
account
of
the
events
of
the
night
a
few
minutes
before
eleven
sir
john
as
we
have
seen
entered
what
was
usually
known
as
la
correrie
or
the
pavilion
of
the
chartreuse
which
was
nothing
more
than
a
chapel
erected
in
the
woods
from
the
sacristy
he
entered
the
choir
it
was
empty
and
seemed
solitary
a
rather
brilliant
moon
veiled
from
time
to
time
by
a
cloud
sent
its
bluish
rays
through
the
stained
glass
cracked
and
broken
of
the
pointed
windows
sir
john
advanced
to
the
middle
of
the
choir
where
he
paused
and
remained
standing
beside
the
pedestal
the
minutes
slipped
away
but
this
time
it
was
not
the
convent
clock
which
marked
the
time
it
was
the
church
at
péronnaz
that
is
to
say
the
nearest
village
to
the
chapel
where
sir
john
was
watching
everything
happened
up
to
midnight
just
as
it
had
to
roland
sir
john
heard
only
the
vague
rustling
and
passing
noises
of
the
night
midnight
sounded
it
was
the
moment
he
awaited
with
impatience
for
it
was
then
that
something
would
happen
if
anything
was
to
happen
as
the
last
stroke
died
away
he
thought
he
heard
footsteps
underground
and
saw
a
light
appear
behind
the
iron
gate
leading
to
the
mortuary
vault
his
whole
attention
was
fixed
on
that
spot
a
monk
emerged
from
the
passage
his
hood
brought
low
over
his
eyes
and
carrying
a
torch
in
his
hand
he
wore
the
dress
of
a
chartreux
a
second
one
followed
then
a
third
sir
john
counted
twelve
they
separated
before
the
altar
there
were
twelve
stalls
in
the
choir
six
to
the
right
of
sir
john
six
to
his
left
the
twelve
monks
silently
took
their
places
in
the
twelve
stalls
each
one
placed
his
torch
in
a
hole
made
for
that
purpose
in
the
oaken
desk
and
waited
a
thirteenth
monk
appeared
and
took
his
stand
before
the
altar
none
of
the
monks
affected
the
fantastic
behavior
of
ghosts
or
shades
they
all
belonged
undoubtedly
to
the
earth
and
were
living
men
sir
john
a
pistol
in
each
hand
stood
leaning
against
the
pedestal
in
the
middle
of
the
choir
and
watched
with
the
utmost
coolness
this
manoeuvre
which
tended
to
surround
him
the
monks
were
standing
like
him
erect
and
silent
the
monk
at
the
altar
broke
the
silence
brothers
he
asked
why
are
the
avengers
assembled
to
judge
a
blasphemer
replied
the
monks
what
crime
has
this
blasphemer
committed
continued
the
interlocutor
he
has
tried
to
discover
the
secrets
of
the
companions
of
what
penalty
has
he
incurred
the
monk
at
the
altar
waited
apparently
to
give
time
for
the
sentence
which
had
just
been
pronounced
to
reach
the
heart
of
him
whom
it
concerned
then
turning
to
the
englishman
who
continued
as
calm
as
if
he
were
at
a
comedy
he
said
sir
john
tanlay
you
are
a
foreigner
and
an
englishman
a
double
reason
why
you
should
leave
the
companions
of
jehu
to
fight
their
own
battles
with
the
government
whose
downfall
they
have
sworn
you
failed
in
wisdom
you
yielded
to
idle
curiosity
instead
of
keeping
away
you
have
entered
the
lion
s
den
and
the
lion
will
rend
then
after
an
instant
s
silence
during
which
he
seemed
to
await
the
englishman
s
reply
he
resumed
seeing
that
he
remained
silent
sir
john
tanlay
you
are
condemned
to
death
prepare
to
die
ah
i
see
that
i
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
band
of
thieves
if
so
i
can
buy
myself
off
with
a
then
turning
to
the
monk
at
the
altar
he
asked
how
much
do
you
demand
captain
a
threatening
murmur
greeted
these
insolent
words
the
monk
at
the
altar
stretched
out
his
hand
you
are
mistaken
sir
john
we
are
not
a
band
of
thieves
said
he
in
a
tone
as
calm
and
composed
as
sir
john
s
and
the
proof
is
that
if
you
have
money
or
jewels
upon
you
you
need
only
give
me
your
instructions
and
they
will
be
remitted
either
to
your
family
or
the
person
whom
you
and
what
guarantee
shall
i
have
that
my
last
wishes
will
be
carried
out
my
the
word
of
the
leader
of
assassins
i
don
t
trust
this
time
as
before
you
are
mistaken
sir
john
i
am
no
more
the
leader
of
assassins
than
i
am
a
captain
of
who
are
you
then
the
elect
of
celestial
vengeance
i
am
the
envoy
of
jehu
king
of
israel
who
was
anointed
by
the
prophet
elisha
to
destroy
the
house
of
if
you
are
what
you
say
why
do
you
veil
your
faces
why
do
you
wear
armor
under
your
robes
the
elect
strike
openly
they
risk
death
in
giving
death
throw
back
your
hoods
show
me
your
naked
breasts
and
i
will
admit
that
you
are
what
you
pretend
to
brothers
you
have
heard
him
said
the
monk
at
the
altar
then
stripping
off
his
gown
he
opened
his
coat
waistcoat
and
even
his
shirt
each
monk
did
the
same
and
stood
with
face
exposed
and
bared
breast
they
were
all
handsome
young
men
of
whom
the
eldest
was
apparently
not
more
than
their
dress
was
elegant
but
strange
fact
none
was
armed
they
were
judges
and
nothing
more
be
satisfied
sir
john
tanlay
said
the
monk
at
the
altar
you
will
die
but
in
dying
you
can
as
you
wished
just
now
recognize
and
kill
your
judges
sir
john
you
have
five
minutes
to
prepare
your
soul
for
death
sir
john
instead
of
profiting
by
this
permission
to
think
of
his
eternal
salvation
coolly
cocked
his
pistols
to
see
that
the
triggers
were
all
right
and
passed
a
ramrod
down
the
barrels
to
make
sure
that
the
balls
were
there
then
without
waiting
for
the
five
minutes
to
expire
he
said
gentlemen
i
am
ready
are
you
the
young
men
looked
at
each
other
then
on
a
sign
from
their
chief
they
walked
straight
to
sir
john
and
surrounded
him
on
all
sides
the
monk
at
the
altar
stood
immovable
commanding
with
his
eye
the
scene
that
was
about
to
take
place
sir
john
had
only
two
pistols
consequently
he
could
only
kill
two
men
he
selected
his
victims
and
fired
two
companions
of
jehu
rolled
upon
the
pavement
which
they
reddened
with
their
blood
the
others
as
if
nothing
had
happened
still
advanced
with
outstretched
hands
upon
sir
john
sir
john
seized
his
pistols
by
the
muzzle
using
them
like
hammers
he
was
vigorous
and
the
struggle
was
long
for
ten
minutes
a
confused
group
tussled
in
the
centre
of
the
choir
then
this
violent
commotion
ceased
and
the
companions
of
jehu
drew
away
to
right
and
left
and
regained
their
stalls
leaving
sir
john
bound
with
their
girdles
and
lying
upon
the
pedestal
in
the
choir
have
you
commended
your
soul
to
god
asked
the
monk
at
the
altar
yes
assassin
answered
sir
john
you
may
the
monk
took
a
dagger
from
the
altar
advanced
with
uplifted
arm
and
standing
over
sir
john
levelled
the
dagger
at
his
breast
sir
john
tanlay
he
said
you
are
a
brave
man
and
doubtless
a
man
of
honor
swear
that
you
will
never
breathe
a
syllable
of
what
you
have
seen
swear
that
under
no
circumstances
whatever
they
may
be
you
will
recognize
us
and
we
will
spare
your
as
soon
as
i
leave
here
replied
sir
john
i
shall
denounce
you
the
moment
i
am
free
i
will
trail
you
swear
repeated
the
monk
a
second
time
no
said
sir
john
swear
said
the
monk
for
the
third
time
never
replied
sir
john
then
die
since
you
will
it
and
he
drove
his
dagger
up
to
the
hilt
in
sir
john
s
breast
who
whether
by
force
of
will
or
because
the
blow
killed
him
at
once
did
not
even
sigh
then
the
monk
in
a
loud
sonorous
voice
like
a
man
conscious
of
having
done
his
duty
exclaimed
justice
is
done
then
he
returned
to
the
altar
leaving
the
dagger
in
the
wound
and
said
brothers
you
are
invited
to
the
ball
of
the
victims
which
takes
place
in
paris
on
the
of
january
next
at
no
rue
du
bac
in
memory
of
the
death
of
king
louis
so
saying
he
the
subterranean
passage
followed
by
the
remaining
ten
monks
each
bearing
his
torch
in
his
hand
two
torches
remained
to
light
the
three
bodies
a
moment
later
four
serving
brothers
entered
and
raised
first
the
bodies
of
the
two
monks
which
they
carried
into
the
vault
then
they
returned
lifted
that
of
sir
john
placed
it
on
a
stretcher
and
carried
it
out
of
the
chapel
by
the
entrance
door
which
they
closed
after
them
two
of
the
monks
walked
in
front
of
the
stretcher
carrying
the
two
torches
left
in
the
chapel
and
now
if
our
readers
ask
why
there
was
this
difference
between
the
treatment
received
by
roland
and
that
administered
to
sir
john
why
this
mansuetude
toward
one
and
this
rigor
toward
the
other
we
reply
remember
that
morgan
enjoined
on
his
brethren
the
safety
of
amélie
s
brother
and
thus
safeguarded
under
no
circumstances
could
roland
die
by
the
hand
of
a
companion
of
jehu
chapter
xix
the
little
house
in
the
rue
de
la
victoire
while
they
are
bearing
sir
john
tanlay
s
body
to
the
château
des
while
roland
is
hurrying
in
the
same
direction
while
the
peasant
despatched
by
him
is
hastening
to
bourg
to
notify
milliet
of
the
catastrophe
which
necessitated
his
immediate
presence
at
madame
de
montrevel
s
home
let
us
jump
over
the
distance
which
separates
bourg
from
paris
and
the
time
which
elapsed
between
the
of
october
and
the
of
november
that
is
to
say
between
the
of
vendemiaire
and
the
brumaire
and
repair
to
that
little
house
in
the
rue
de
la
victoire
rendered
historically
famous
by
the
conspiracy
of
the
brumaire
which
issued
from
it
fully
armed
it
is
the
same
house
which
stands
there
on
the
right
of
the
street
at
no
apparently
astonished
to
present
to
the
eye
after
so
many
successive
changes
of
government
the
consular
fasces
which
may
still
be
seen
on
the
panels
of
its
double
oaken
doors
let
us
follow
the
long
narrow
alley
of
lindens
that
leads
from
the
gate
on
the
street
to
the
door
of
the
house
let
us
enter
the
antechamber
take
the
hall
to
the
right
ascend
the
twenty
steps
that
lead
to
a
study
hung
with
green
paper
and
furnished
with
curtains
easy
chairs
and
couches
of
the
same
color
the
walls
are
covered
with
geographical
charts
and
plans
of
cities
bookcases
of
maple
are
ranged
on
either
side
of
the
fireplace
which
they
inclose
the
chairs
sofas
tables
and
desks
are
piled
with
books
there
is
scarcely
any
room
on
the
chairs
to
sit
down
or
on
the
desks
and
tables
to
write
in
the
midst
of
this
encumbering
mass
of
reports
letters
pamphlets
and
books
a
man
had
cleared
a
space
for
himself
where
he
was
now
seated
clutching
his
hair
impatiently
from
time
to
time
as
he
endeavored
to
decipher
a
page
of
notes
compared
to
which
the
hieroglyphics
on
the
obelisk
of
luxor
would
have
been
transparently
intelligible
just
as
the
secretary
s
impatience
was
approaching
desperation
the
door
opened
and
a
young
officer
wearing
an
aide
s
uniform
entered
the
secretary
raised
his
head
and
a
lively
expression
of
satisfaction
crossed
his
face
oh
my
dear
roland
said
he
you
here
at
last
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
for
three
reasons
first
because
i
am
wearying
for
you
second
because
the
general
is
impatient
for
your
return
and
keeps
up
a
hullaballoo
about
it
and
third
because
you
can
help
me
to
read
this
with
which
i
have
been
struggling
for
the
last
ten
minutes
but
first
of
all
kiss
and
the
secretary
and
the
embraced
each
other
well
said
the
latter
let
us
see
this
word
that
is
troubling
you
so
my
dear
bourrienne
ah
my
dear
fellow
what
writing
i
get
a
white
hair
for
every
page
i
decipher
and
this
is
my
third
here
read
it
if
you
roland
took
the
sheet
from
the
secretary
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
spot
indicated
read
quite
fluently
paragraph
xi
the
nile
from
assouan
to
a
distance
of
twelve
miles
north
of
cairo
flows
in
a
single
stream
well
said
he
interrupting
himself
that
s
all
plain
sailing
what
did
you
mean
the
general
on
the
contrary
took
pains
when
he
wrote
go
on
go
on
said
bourrienne
the
young
man
resumed
from
that
point
which
is
called
ah
ah
there
you
are
now
what
do
you
say
to
that
roland
repeated
which
is
called
the
devil
which
is
called
yes
which
is
called
after
that
what
will
you
give
me
bourrienne
cried
roland
if
i
guess
it
the
first
colonel
s
commission
i
find
signed
in
by
my
faith
no
i
don
t
want
to
leave
the
general
i
d
rather
have
a
good
father
than
five
hundred
naughty
children
i
ll
give
you
the
three
words
for
what
are
there
three
words
there
they
don
t
look
as
if
they
were
quite
three
i
admit
now
listen
and
make
obeisance
to
me
from
the
point
called
ventre
della
ha
ventre
de
la
vache
confound
it
he
s
illegible
enough
in
french
but
if
he
takes
it
into
his
head
to
go
off
in
italian
and
that
corsican
patois
to
boot
i
thought
i
only
ran
the
risk
of
going
crazy
but
then
i
should
become
stupid
too
well
you
ve
got
it
and
he
read
the
whole
sentence
consecutively
the
nile
from
assouan
to
a
distance
of
twelve
miles
north
of
cairo
flows
in
a
single
stream
from
that
point
which
is
called
ventre
de
la
vache
it
forms
the
branches
of
the
rosetta
and
the
thank
you
roland
and
he
began
to
write
the
end
of
the
paragraph
of
which
the
first
lines
were
already
committed
to
paper
tell
me
said
roland
is
he
still
got
his
hobby
the
dear
general
of
colonizing
egypt
yes
and
then
as
a
sort
of
offset
a
little
governing
in
france
we
will
colonize
from
a
well
my
dear
bourrienne
suppose
you
post
me
a
little
on
matters
in
this
country
so
that
i
won
t
seem
to
have
just
arrived
from
in
the
first
place
did
you
come
back
of
your
own
accord
or
were
you
recalled
recalled
i
should
think
so
by
whom
the
general
special
despatch
written
by
himself
see
the
young
man
drew
a
paper
from
his
pocket
containing
two
lines
not
signed
in
the
same
handwriting
as
that
which
bourrienne
had
before
him
these
two
lines
said
start
be
in
paris
brumaire
i
need
yes
said
bourrienne
i
think
it
will
be
on
the
what
will
be
on
the
eighteenth
on
my
word
roland
you
ask
more
than
i
know
that
man
as
you
are
aware
is
not
communicative
what
will
take
place
on
the
brumaire
i
don
t
know
as
yet
but
i
ll
answer
for
it
that
something
will
oh
you
must
have
a
suspicion
i
think
he
means
to
make
himself
director
in
place
of
sièyes
or
perhaps
president
in
gohier
s
good
how
about
the
constitution
of
the
year
iii
the
constitution
of
the
year
iii
what
about
that
why
yes
a
man
must
be
forty
years
old
to
be
a
director
and
the
general
lacks
just
ten
of
the
deuce
so
much
the
worse
for
the
constitution
they
must
violate
it
is
rather
young
yet
bourrienne
they
don
t
as
a
rule
violate
children
of
my
dear
fellow
in
barras
hands
everything
grows
old
rapidly
the
little
girl
of
seven
is
already
an
old
roland
shook
his
head
well
what
is
it
asked
bourrienne
why
i
don
t
believe
the
general
will
make
himself
a
simple
director
with
four
colleagues
just
imagine
it
five
kings
of
france
it
wouldn
t
be
a
directory
any
longer
but
a
anyway
up
to
the
present
that
is
all
he
has
allowed
any
one
to
perceive
but
you
know
my
dear
friend
if
we
want
to
know
the
general
s
secrets
we
must
guess
faith
i
m
too
lazy
to
take
the
trouble
bourrienne
besides
i
m
a
regular
janissary
what
is
to
be
will
be
why
the
devil
should
i
bother
to
form
an
opinion
and
battle
for
it
it
s
quite
wearisome
enough
to
have
to
and
the
young
man
enforced
his
favorite
aphorism
with
a
long
yawn
then
he
added
do
you
think
there
will
be
any
sword
play
then
there
will
be
a
chance
of
getting
killed
that
s
all
i
want
where
is
the
general
with
madame
bonaparte
he
went
to
her
about
fifteen
minutes
ago
have
you
let
him
know
you
are
here
no
i
wanted
to
see
you
first
but
i
hear
his
step
just
then
the
door
was
opened
abruptly
and
the
same
historical
personage
whom
we
saw
playing
a
silent
part
incognito
at
avignon
appeared
on
the
threshold
in
the
picturesque
uniform
of
the
of
the
army
of
egypt
except
that
being
in
his
own
house
he
was
roland
thought
his
eyes
were
more
hollow
and
his
skin
more
leaden
than
usual
but
the
moment
he
saw
the
young
man
bonaparte
s
gloomy
or
rather
meditative
eye
emitted
a
flash
of
joy
ah
here
you
are
roland
he
said
true
as
steel
called
you
come
welcome
my
dear
and
he
offered
roland
his
hand
then
he
asked
with
an
imperceptible
smile
what
were
you
doing
with
bourrienne
waiting
for
you
and
in
the
meantime
gossiping
like
two
old
i
admit
it
general
i
was
showing
him
my
order
to
be
here
on
the
did
i
write
the
or
the
oh
the
general
the
would
have
been
too
why
too
late
why
hang
it
bourrienne
says
there
are
to
be
great
doings
here
on
the
capital
muttered
bourrienne
the
will
earn
me
a
ah
so
he
told
you
i
had
planned
great
doings
for
the
then
approaching
bourrienne
bonaparte
pinched
his
ear
and
said
then
to
roland
he
added
well
it
is
so
my
dear
fellow
we
have
made
great
plans
for
the
my
wife
and
i
dine
with
president
gohier
an
excellent
man
who
was
very
polite
to
josephine
during
my
absence
you
are
to
dine
with
us
roland
looked
at
bonaparte
was
it
for
that
you
brought
me
here
general
he
asked
laughing
for
that
and
something
else
too
perhaps
bourrienne
write
bourrienne
hastily
seized
his
pen
are
you
ready
yes
my
dear
president
i
write
to
let
you
know
that
my
wife
and
i
with
one
of
my
will
dine
with
you
the
day
after
this
is
merely
to
say
that
we
shall
be
quite
satisfied
with
a
family
what
next
how
do
you
mean
shall
i
put
liberty
equality
fraternity
or
death
added
roland
no
said
bonaparte
give
me
the
he
took
the
pen
from
bourrienne
s
hands
and
wrote
ever
yours
then
pushing
away
the
paper
he
added
address
it
bourrienne
and
send
an
orderly
with
bourrienne
wrote
the
address
sealed
it
and
rang
the
bell
an
officer
on
duty
entered
send
an
orderly
with
that
said
bourrienne
there
is
an
answer
added
bonaparte
the
officer
closed
the
door
bourrienne
said
bonaparte
pointing
to
roland
look
at
your
well
general
i
am
looking
at
do
you
know
what
he
did
at
avignon
i
hope
he
didn
t
make
a
no
he
threw
a
plate
at
a
man
s
oh
that
was
hasty
that
s
not
that
i
can
well
he
fought
a
duel
with
that
and
most
naturally
he
killed
exactly
do
you
know
why
he
did
it
the
general
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
because
the
man
said
that
i
was
a
then
looking
at
roland
with
an
indefinable
expression
of
raillery
and
affection
he
added
ninny
then
suddenly
he
burst
out
oh
by
the
way
and
the
englishman
exactly
the
englishman
general
i
was
just
going
to
speak
to
you
about
is
he
still
in
france
yes
and
for
awhile
even
i
thought
he
would
remain
here
till
the
last
trumpet
blew
its
blast
through
the
valley
of
did
you
miss
killing
him
oh
no
not
i
we
are
the
best
friends
in
the
world
general
he
is
a
capital
fellow
and
so
original
to
boot
that
i
m
going
to
ask
a
bit
of
a
favor
for
the
devil
for
an
englishman
said
bonaparte
shaking
his
head
i
don
t
like
the
good
as
a
people
but
individually
well
what
happened
to
your
friend
he
was
tried
condemned
and
what
the
devil
are
you
telling
us
god
s
truth
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
he
was
tried
condemned
and
guillotined
oh
not
exactly
that
tried
and
condemned
but
not
guillotined
if
he
had
been
guillotined
he
would
be
more
dangerously
ill
than
he
is
now
what
are
you
gabbling
about
what
court
tried
and
condemned
him
that
of
the
companions
of
jehu
and
who
are
the
companions
of
jehu
goodness
have
you
forgotten
our
friend
morgan
already
the
masked
man
who
brought
back
the
s
two
hundred
louis
no
replied
bonaparte
i
have
not
forgotten
him
i
told
you
about
the
scamp
s
audacity
didn
t
i
bourrienne
yes
general
said
bourrienne
and
i
answered
that
had
i
been
in
your
place
i
should
have
tried
to
find
out
who
he
and
the
general
would
know
had
he
left
me
alone
i
was
just
going
to
spring
at
his
throat
and
tear
off
his
mask
when
the
general
said
in
that
tone
you
know
so
well
friend
roland
come
back
to
your
englishman
chatterbox
cried
the
general
did
morgan
murder
him
no
not
he
himself
but
his
but
you
were
speaking
of
a
court
and
a
trial
just
general
you
are
always
the
same
said
roland
with
their
old
school
familiarity
you
want
to
know
and
you
don
t
give
me
time
to
tell
get
elected
to
the
five
hundred
and
you
can
talk
as
much
as
you
good
in
the
five
hundred
i
should
have
four
hundred
and
colleagues
who
would
want
to
talk
as
much
as
i
and
who
would
take
the
words
out
of
my
mouth
i
d
rather
be
interrupted
by
you
than
by
a
will
you
go
on
i
ask
nothing
better
now
imagine
general
there
is
a
chartreuse
near
bourg
the
chartreuse
of
seillon
i
know
what
you
know
the
chartreuse
of
seillon
demanded
roland
doesn
t
the
general
know
everything
cried
bourrienne
well
about
the
chartreuse
are
there
any
monks
there
now
no
only
ghosts
are
you
perchance
going
to
tell
me
a
and
a
famous
one
at
that
the
devil
bourrienne
knows
i
love
them
go
well
we
were
told
at
home
that
the
chartreuse
was
haunted
by
ghosts
of
course
you
understand
that
sir
john
and
i
or
rather
i
and
sir
john
wanted
to
clear
our
minds
about
it
so
we
each
spent
a
night
where
why
at
the
bonaparte
made
an
imperceptible
sign
of
the
cross
with
his
thumb
a
corsican
habit
which
he
never
lost
ah
he
exclaimed
did
you
see
any
ghosts
and
what
did
you
do
to
it
shot
at
and
then
it
walked
and
you
allowed
yourself
to
be
baffled
good
how
well
you
know
me
i
followed
it
and
fired
again
but
as
he
knew
his
way
among
the
ruins
better
than
i
he
escaped
the
devil
the
next
day
it
was
sir
john
s
turn
i
mean
our
did
he
see
your
ghost
he
saw
something
better
he
saw
twelve
monks
enter
the
church
who
tried
him
for
trying
to
find
out
their
secrets
condemned
him
to
death
and
who
on
my
word
of
honor
stabbed
didn
t
he
defend
himself
like
a
lion
he
killed
is
he
dead
almost
but
i
hope
he
will
recover
just
imagine
general
he
was
found
by
the
road
and
brought
home
with
a
dagger
in
his
breast
like
a
prop
in
a
why
it
s
like
a
scene
of
the
neither
more
nor
and
on
the
blade
of
the
dagger
that
there
might
be
no
doubt
as
to
who
did
the
deed
were
graven
the
words
companions
of
why
it
isn
t
possible
that
such
things
can
happen
in
france
in
the
last
year
of
the
eighteenth
century
it
might
do
for
germany
in
the
middle
ages
in
the
days
of
the
henrys
and
the
not
possible
general
but
here
is
the
dagger
what
do
you
say
to
that
attractive
isn
t
it
and
the
young
man
drew
from
under
his
coat
a
dagger
made
entirely
of
steel
blade
and
handle
the
handle
was
shaped
like
a
cross
and
on
the
blade
sure
enough
were
engraved
the
words
companions
of
bonaparte
examined
the
weapon
carefully
and
you
say
they
planted
that
plaything
in
your
englishman
s
breast
up
to
the
and
he
s
not
dead
not
yet
at
any
have
you
been
listening
bourrienne
with
the
greatest
you
must
remind
me
of
this
when
general
when
when
i
am
master
come
and
say
to
josephine
come
bourrienne
you
will
dine
with
us
and
be
careful
what
you
say
you
two
for
moreau
is
coming
to
dinner
ah
i
will
keep
the
dagger
as
a
he
went
out
first
followed
by
roland
who
was
soon
after
followed
by
bourrienne
on
the
stairs
they
met
the
orderly
who
had
taken
the
note
to
gohier
well
asked
the
general
here
is
the
president
s
give
it
to
bonaparte
broke
the
seal
and
read
the
president
gohier
is
enchanted
the
good
fortune
promised
him
by
general
bonaparte
he
will
expect
him
to
dinner
the
day
after
the
brumaire
with
his
charming
wife
and
the
whoever
he
may
be
dinner
will
be
served
at
five
o
clock
if
the
hour
does
not
suit
general
bonaparte

chapter
xx
the
guests
of
general
bonaparte
josephine
in
spite
of
her
years
or
possibly
because
of
them
that
enchanting
age
when
woman
hovers
between
her
passing
youth
and
her
corning
age
josephine
always
beautiful
more
graceful
than
ever
was
still
the
charming
woman
we
all
know
an
imprudent
remark
of
junot
s
at
the
time
of
her
husband
s
return
had
produced
a
slight
coolness
between
them
but
three
days
had
sufficed
to
restore
to
the
enchantress
her
full
power
over
the
victor
of
rivoli
and
the
pyramids
she
was
doing
the
honors
of
her
salon
when
roland
entered
the
room
always
incapable
like
the
true
creole
she
was
of
controlling
her
emotions
she
gave
a
cry
of
joy
and
held
out
her
hand
to
him
she
knew
that
roland
was
devoted
to
her
husband
she
knew
his
reckless
bravery
knew
that
if
the
young
man
had
twenty
lives
he
would
willingly
have
given
them
all
for
bonaparte
roland
eagerly
took
the
hand
she
offered
him
and
kissed
it
respectfully
josephine
had
known
roland
s
mother
in
martinique
and
she
never
failed
whenever
she
saw
roland
to
speak
to
him
of
his
maternal
grandfather
de
la
clémencière
in
whose
magnificent
garden
as
a
child
she
was
wont
to
gather
those
wonderful
fruits
which
are
unknown
in
our
colder
climates
a
subject
of
conversation
was
therefore
ready
at
hand
she
inquired
tenderly
after
madame
de
montrevel
s
health
and
that
of
her
daughter
and
little
edouard
then
the
information
given
she
said
my
dear
roland
i
must
now
pay
attention
to
my
other
guests
but
try
to
remain
after
the
other
guests
or
else
let
me
see
you
alone
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
she
glanced
at
bonaparte
and
have
a
thousand
things
to
tell
then
pressing
the
young
man
s
hand
with
a
sigh
she
added
no
matter
what
happens
you
will
never
leave
him
will
you
what
do
you
mean
asked
roland
amazed
i
know
what
i
mean
said
josephine
and
when
you
have
talked
ten
minutes
with
bonaparte
you
will
i
am
sure
understand
me
in
the
meantime
watch
and
listen
and
keep
roland
bowed
and
drew
aside
resolved
as
josephine
had
advised
to
play
the
part
of
observer
but
what
was
there
to
observe
three
principal
groups
occupied
the
salon
the
first
gathered
around
madame
bonaparte
the
only
woman
present
was
more
a
flux
and
reflux
than
a
group
the
second
surrounding
talma
was
composed
of
arnault
monge
berthollet
and
two
or
three
other
members
of
the
institute
the
third
which
bonaparte
had
just
joined
counted
in
its
circle
talleyrand
barras
lucien
admiral
bruix
footnote
author
s
not
to
be
confounded
with
de
brueys
who
was
killed
at
aboukir
august
admiral
bruix
the
negotiator
with
talleyrand
of
the
brumaire
did
not
die
until
roederer
regnaud
de
angely
fouché
réal
and
two
or
three
generals
among
whom
was
lefebvre
in
the
first
group
they
talked
of
fashions
music
the
theatre
in
the
second
literature
science
dramatic
art
in
the
third
they
talked
of
everything
except
that
which
was
uppermost
in
their
minds
doubtless
this
reserve
was
not
in
keeping
with
bonaparte
s
own
feeling
at
the
moment
for
after
sharing
in
this
commonplace
conversation
for
a
short
time
he
took
the
former
bishop
of
autun
by
the
arm
and
led
him
into
the
embrasure
of
the
window
well
he
asked
talleyrand
looked
at
bonaparte
with
that
air
which
belonged
to
no
one
but
him
what
did
i
tell
you
of
sièyes
general
you
told
me
to
secure
the
support
of
those
who
regarded
the
friends
of
the
republic
as
jacobins
and
to
rely
upon
it
that
sièyes
was
at
their
i
was
not
then
he
will
yield
better
he
has
the
man
who
wanted
to
shoot
me
at
fréjus
for
having
landed
without
being
quarantined
oh
no
not
for
but
what
then
for
not
having
looked
at
him
or
spoken
to
him
at
gohier
s
i
must
confess
that
i
did
it
on
purpose
i
can
not
endure
that
unfrocked
bonaparte
perceived
too
late
that
the
speech
he
had
just
made
was
like
the
sword
of
the
archangel
if
sièyes
was
unfrocked
talleyrand
was
unmitred
he
cast
a
rapid
glance
at
his
companion
s
face
the
of
autun
was
smiling
his
sweetest
smile
then
i
can
count
upon
him
i
will
answer
for
and
cambacérès
and
lebrun
have
you
seen
them
i
took
sièyes
in
hand
as
the
most
recalcitrant
bruix
saw
the
other
the
admiral
from
the
midst
of
the
group
had
never
taken
his
eyes
off
of
the
general
and
the
diplomatist
he
suspected
that
their
conversation
had
a
special
importance
bonaparte
made
him
a
sign
to
join
them
a
less
able
man
would
have
done
so
at
once
but
bruix
avoided
such
a
mistake
he
walked
about
the
room
with
affected
indifference
and
then
as
if
he
had
just
perceived
talleyrand
and
bonaparte
talking
together
he
went
up
to
them
bruix
is
a
very
able
man
said
bonaparte
who
judged
men
as
much
by
little
as
by
great
things
and
above
all
very
cautious
general
said
talleyrand
yes
we
will
need
a
corkscrew
to
pull
anything
out
of
oh
no
on
the
contrary
now
that
he
has
joined
us
he
will
broach
the
question
and
indeed
no
sooner
had
bruix
joined
them
than
he
began
in
words
as
clear
as
they
were
concise
i
have
seen
them
they
waver
they
waver
cambacérès
and
lebrun
waver
lebrun
i
can
understand
a
sort
of
man
of
letters
a
moderate
a
puritan
but
cambacérès
but
it
is
but
didn
t
you
tell
them
that
i
intended
to
make
them
each
a
consul
i
didn
t
get
as
far
as
that
replied
bruix
laughing
and
why
not
inquired
bonaparte
because
this
is
the
first
word
you
have
told
me
about
your
intentions
citizen
true
said
bonaparte
biting
his
lips
am
i
to
repair
the
omission
asked
bruix
no
no
exclaimed
bonaparte
hastily
they
might
think
i
needed
them
i
won
t
have
any
quibbling
they
must
decide
without
any
other
conditions
than
those
you
have
offered
them
it
will
be
too
late
i
feel
strong
enough
to
stand
alone
and
i
now
have
sièyes
and
barras
repeated
the
two
negotiators
astonished
yes
barras
who
treated
me
like
a
little
corporal
and
wouldn
t
send
me
back
to
italy
because
he
said
i
had
made
my
fortune
there
and
it
was
useless
to
return
well
barras
barras
then
changing
his
mind
faith
i
may
as
well
tell
you
do
you
know
what
barras
said
at
dinner
yesterday
before
me
that
it
was
impossible
to
go
on
any
longer
with
the
constitution
of
the
year
iii
he
admitted
the
necessity
of
a
dictatorship
said
he
had
decided
to
abandon
the
reins
of
government
and
retire
adding
that
he
himself
was
looked
upon
as
and
that
the
republic
needed
new
men
now
guess
to
whom
he
thinks
of
transferring
his
power
i
give
it
you
as
madame
de
sévigné
says
in
a
hundred
thousand
ten
thousand
no
other
than
general
hedouville
a
worthy
man
but
i
have
only
to
look
him
in
the
face
to
make
him
lower
his
eyes
my
glance
must
have
been
blasting
as
the
result
barras
came
to
my
bedside
at
eight
o
clock
to
excuse
himself
as
best
he
could
for
the
nonsense
he
talked
the
night
before
and
admitted
that
i
alone
could
save
the
republic
and
placed
himself
at
my
disposal
to
do
what
i
wished
assume
any
rôle
i
might
assign
him
begging
me
to
promise
that
if
i
had
any
plan
in
my
head
i
would
count
on
him
yes
on
him
and
he
would
be
true
to
the
crack
of
and
yet
said
talleyrand
unable
to
resist
a
play
upon
words
doom
is
not
a
word
with
which
to
conjure
bonaparte
glanced
at
the
yes
i
know
that
barras
is
your
friend
the
friend
of
fouché
and
réal
but
he
is
not
mine
and
i
shall
prove
it
to
him
go
back
to
lebrun
and
cambacérès
bruix
and
let
them
make
their
own
then
looking
at
his
watch
and
frowning
he
added
it
seems
to
me
that
moreau
keeps
us
so
saying
he
turned
to
the
group
which
surrounded
talma
the
two
diplomatists
watched
him
then
admiral
bruix
asked
in
a
low
voice
what
do
you
say
my
dear
maurice
to
such
sentiments
toward
the
man
who
picked
him
out
a
mere
lieutenant
at
the
siege
of
toulon
who
trusted
him
to
defend
the
convention
on
the
vendémiaire
and
who
named
him
when
only
of
the
army
in
italy
i
say
my
dear
admiral
replied
de
talleyrand
with
his
pallid
mocking
smile
that
some
services
are
so
great
that
ingratitude
alone
can
repay
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
general
moreau
was
announced
at
this
announcement
which
was
more
than
a
piece
of
news
it
was
a
surprise
to
most
of
those
present
every
eye
was
turned
toward
the
door
moreau
appeared
at
this
period
three
men
were
in
the
eyes
of
france
moreau
was
one
of
these
three
men
the
two
others
were
bonaparte
and
pichegru
each
had
become
a
sort
of
symbol
since
the
fructidor
pichegru
had
become
the
symbol
of
monarchy
moreau
since
he
had
been
christened
fabius
was
the
symbol
of
the
republic
bonaparte
symbol
of
war
dominated
them
both
by
the
adventurous
aspect
of
his
genius
moreau
was
at
that
time
in
the
full
strength
of
his
age
we
would
say
the
full
strength
of
his
genius
if
decision
were
not
one
of
the
characteristics
of
genius
but
no
one
was
ever
more
undecided
than
the
famous
cunctator
he
was
years
old
tall
with
a
sweet
calm
firm
countenance
and
must
have
resembled
xenophon
bonaparte
had
never
seen
him
nor
had
he
on
his
side
ever
seen
bonaparte
while
the
one
was
battling
on
the
adige
and
the
mincio
the
other
fought
beside
the
danube
and
the
rhine
bonaparte
came
forward
to
greet
him
saying
you
are
welcome
general
general
replied
moreau
smiling
courteously
while
all
present
made
a
circle
around
them
to
see
how
this
new
cæsar
would
meet
the
new
pompey
you
come
from
egypt
victorious
while
i
come
defeated
from
a
defeat
which
was
not
yours
and
for
which
you
are
not
responsible
general
it
was
joubert
s
fault
if
he
had
rejoined
the
army
of
italy
as
soon
as
he
had
been
made
it
is
more
than
probable
that
the
russians
and
austrians
with
the
troops
they
then
had
could
not
have
resisted
him
but
he
remained
in
paris
for
his
honeymoon
poor
joubert
paid
with
his
life
for
that
fatal
month
which
gave
the
enemy
time
to
gather
its
reinforcements
the
surrender
of
mantua
gave
them
fifteen
thousand
men
on
the
eve
of
the
battle
it
was
impossible
that
our
poor
army
should
not
have
been
overwhelmed
by
such
united
alas
yes
said
moreau
it
is
always
the
greater
number
which
defeats
the
a
great
truth
general
exclaimed
bonaparte
an
indisputable
and
yet
said
arnault
joining
in
the
conversation
you
yourself
general
have
defeated
large
armies
with
little
if
you
were
marius
instead
of
the
author
of
marius
you
would
not
say
that
my
dear
poet
even
when
i
beat
great
armies
with
little
ones
listen
to
this
you
young
men
who
obey
and
will
command
it
was
always
the
larger
number
which
defeated
the
i
don
t
understand
said
arnault
and
lefebvre
together
but
moreau
made
a
sign
with
his
head
to
show
that
he
understood
bonaparte
continued
follow
my
theory
for
it
contains
the
whole
art
of
war
when
with
lesser
forces
i
faced
a
large
army
i
gathered
mine
together
with
great
rapidity
fell
like
a
thunderbolt
on
a
wing
of
the
great
army
and
overthrew
it
then
i
profited
by
the
disorder
into
which
this
manoeuvre
never
failed
to
throw
the
enemy
to
attack
again
always
with
my
whole
army
on
the
other
side
i
beat
them
in
this
way
in
detail
and
the
victory
which
resulted
was
always
as
you
see
the
triumph
of
the
many
over
the
as
the
able
general
concluded
his
definition
of
his
own
genius
the
door
opened
and
the
servant
announced
that
dinner
was
served
general
said
bonaparte
leading
moreau
to
josephine
take
in
my
wife
gentlemen
follow
on
this
invitation
all
present
moved
from
the
salon
to
the
after
dinner
on
pretence
of
showing
him
a
magnificent
sabre
he
had
brought
from
egypt
bonaparte
took
moreau
into
his
study
there
the
two
rivals
remained
closeted
more
than
an
hour
what
passed
between
them
what
compact
was
signed
what
promises
were
made
no
one
has
ever
known
only
when
bonaparte
returned
to
the
salon
alone
and
lucien
asked
him
well
what
of
moreau
he
answered
just
as
i
foresaw
he
prefers
military
power
to
political
power
i
have
promised
him
the
command
of
an
bonaparte
smiled
as
he
pronounced
these
words
then
added
in
the
meantime
in
the
meantime
questioned
lucien
he
will
have
that
of
the
luxembourg
i
am
not
sorry
to
make
him
the
jailer
of
the
directors
before
i
make
him
the
conqueror
of
the
the
next
day
the
following
appeared
in
the
moniteur
paris
brumaire
bonaparte
has
presented
moreau
with
a
magnificent
damascus
sword
set
with
precious
stones
which
he
brought
from
egypt
the
value
of
which
is
estimated
at
twelve
thousand
francs
chapter
xxi
the
schedule
of
the
directory
we
have
said
that
moreau
furnished
no
doubt
with
instructions
left
the
little
house
in
the
rue
de
la
victoire
while
bonaparte
returned
alone
to
the
salon
everything
furnished
an
object
of
comment
in
such
a
company
as
was
there
assembled
the
absence
of
moreau
the
return
of
bonaparte
unaccompanied
and
the
visible
good
humor
which
animated
his
countenance
were
all
remarked
upon
the
eyes
which
fastened
upon
him
most
ardently
were
those
of
josephine
and
roland
moreau
for
bonaparte
added
twenty
chances
to
the
success
of
the
plot
moreau
against
bonaparte
robbed
him
of
fifty
josephine
s
eyes
were
so
supplicating
that
on
leaving
lucien
bonaparte
pushed
his
brother
toward
his
wife
lucien
understood
and
approached
josephine
saying
all
is
moreau
with
i
thought
he
was
a
he
has
been
made
to
see
that
we
are
acting
for
the
good
of
the
i
should
have
thought
him
ambitious
said
roland
lucien
started
and
looked
at
the
young
man
you
are
right
said
he
then
remarked
josephine
if
he
is
ambitious
he
will
not
let
bonaparte
seize
the
why
not
because
he
will
want
it
yes
but
he
will
wait
till
it
comes
to
him
inasmuch
as
he
doesn
t
know
how
to
create
it
and
is
afraid
to
seize
during
this
time
bonaparte
had
joined
the
group
which
had
formed
around
talma
after
dinner
as
well
as
before
remarkable
men
are
always
the
centre
of
attraction
what
are
you
saying
talma
demanded
bonaparte
it
seems
to
me
they
are
listening
to
you
very
yes
but
my
reign
is
over
replied
the
artist
why
so
i
do
as
citizen
barras
has
done
i
abdicate
so
citizen
barras
has
abdicated
so
rumor
is
it
known
who
will
take
his
place
it
is
is
it
one
of
your
friends
talma
time
was
said
talma
bowing
when
he
did
me
the
honor
to
say
i
was
well
in
that
case
talma
i
shall
ask
for
your
granted
said
talma
laughing
it
only
remains
to
ask
how
it
can
serve
get
me
sent
back
to
italy
barras
would
not
let
me
the
deuce
said
talma
don
t
you
know
the
song
general
we
won
t
go
back
to
the
woods
when
the
laurels
are
clipped
oh
roscius
roscius
said
bonaparte
smiling
have
you
grown
a
flatterer
during
my
absence
roscius
was
the
friend
of
cæsar
general
and
when
the
conqueror
returned
from
gaul
he
probably
said
to
him
about
the
same
thing
i
have
said
to
bonaparte
laid
his
band
on
talma
s
shoulder
would
he
have
said
the
same
words
after
crossing
the
rubicon
talma
looked
bonaparte
straight
in
the
face
no
he
replied
he
would
have
said
like
the
augur
cæsar
beware
of
the
ides
of
march
bonaparte
slipped
his
hand
into
his
breast
as
if
in
search
of
something
finding
the
dagger
of
the
companions
of
jehu
he
grasped
it
convulsively
had
he
a
presentiment
of
the
conspiracies
of
arena
and
cadoudal
just
then
the
door
opened
and
a
servant
announced
general
bernadotte
bernadotte
muttered
bonaparte
involuntarily
what
does
he
want
here
since
bonaparte
s
return
bernadotte
had
held
aloof
from
him
refusing
all
the
advances
which
the
and
his
friends
had
made
him
the
fact
is
bernadotte
had
long
since
discerned
the
politician
beneath
the
soldier
s
greatcoat
the
dictator
beneath
the
general
and
bernadotte
for
all
that
he
became
king
in
later
years
was
at
that
time
a
very
different
republican
from
moreau
moreover
bernadotte
believed
he
had
reason
to
complain
of
bonaparte
his
military
career
had
not
been
less
brilliant
than
that
of
the
young
general
his
fortunes
were
destined
to
run
parallel
with
his
to
the
end
only
more
fortunate
than
that
other
bernadotte
was
to
die
on
his
throne
it
is
true
he
did
not
conquer
that
throne
he
was
called
to
it
son
of
a
lawyer
at
pau
bernadotte
born
in
that
is
to
say
five
years
before
bonaparte
was
in
the
ranks
as
a
private
soldier
when
only
eighteen
in
he
was
only
a
but
those
were
the
days
of
rapid
promotion
in
kléber
created
him
on
the
field
of
battle
where
he
had
decided
the
fortunes
of
the
day
becoming
a
general
of
division
he
played
a
brilliant
part
at
fleurus
and
juliers
forced
maestricht
to
capitulate
took
altdorf
and
protected
against
an
army
twice
as
numerous
as
his
own
the
retreat
of
joubert
in
the
directory
ordered
him
to
take
seventeen
thousand
men
to
bonaparte
these
seventeen
thousand
men
were
his
old
soldiers
veterans
of
kléber
marceau
and
hoche
soldiers
of
the
and
yet
bernadotte
forgot
all
rivalry
and
seconded
bonaparte
with
all
his
might
taking
part
in
the
passage
of
the
tagliamento
capturing
gradiska
trieste
laybach
idria
bringing
back
to
the
directory
after
the
campaign
the
flags
of
the
enemy
and
accepting
possibly
with
reluctance
an
embassy
to
vienna
while
bonaparte
secured
the
command
of
the
army
of
egypt
at
vienna
a
riot
excited
by
the
flag
hoisted
above
the
french
embassy
for
which
the
ambassador
was
unable
to
obtain
redress
forced
him
to
demand
his
passports
on
his
return
to
paris
the
directory
appointed
him
minister
of
war
an
underhand
proceeding
of
sièyes
who
was
offended
by
bernadotte
s
republicanism
induced
the
latter
to
send
in
his
resignation
it
was
accepted
and
when
bonaparte
landed
at
fréjus
the
late
minister
had
been
three
months
out
of
office
since
bonaparte
s
return
some
of
bernadotte
s
friends
had
sought
to
bring
about
his
reinstatement
but
bonaparte
had
opposed
it
the
result
was
a
hostility
between
the
two
generals
none
the
less
real
because
not
openly
avowed
bernadotte
s
appearance
in
bonaparte
s
salon
was
therefore
an
event
almost
as
extraordinary
as
the
presence
of
moreau
and
the
entrance
of
the
conqueror
of
maestricht
caused
as
many
heads
to
turn
as
had
that
of
the
conqueror
of
rastadt
only
instead
of
going
forward
to
meet
him
as
he
had
moreau
bonaparte
merely
turned
round
and
awaited
him
bernadotte
from
the
threshold
of
the
door
cast
a
rapid
glance
around
the
salon
he
divided
and
analyzed
the
groups
and
although
he
must
have
perceived
bonaparte
in
the
midst
of
the
principal
one
he
went
up
to
josephine
who
was
reclining
on
a
couch
at
the
corner
of
the
fireplace
like
the
statue
of
agrippina
in
the
pitti
and
addressing
her
with
chivalric
courtesy
inquired
for
her
health
then
only
did
he
raise
his
head
as
if
to
look
for
bonaparte
at
such
a
time
everything
was
of
too
much
importance
for
those
present
not
to
remark
this
affectation
of
courtesy
on
bernadotte
s
part
bonaparte
with
his
rapid
comprehensive
intellect
was
not
the
last
to
notice
this
he
was
seized
with
impatience
and
instead
of
awaiting
bernadotte
in
the
midst
of
the
group
where
he
happened
to
be
he
turned
abruptly
to
the
embrasure
of
a
window
as
if
to
challenge
the
of
war
to
follow
him
bernadotte
bowed
graciously
to
right
and
left
and
controlling
his
usually
mobile
face
to
an
expression
of
perfect
calmness
he
walked
toward
bonaparte
who
awaited
him
as
a
wrestler
awaits
his
antagonist
the
right
foot
forward
and
his
lips
compressed
the
two
men
bowed
but
bonaparte
made
no
movement
to
extend
his
hand
to
bernadotte
nor
did
the
latter
offer
to
take
it
is
it
you
asked
bonaparte
i
am
glad
to
see
thank
you
general
replied
bernadotte
i
have
come
because
i
wish
to
give
you
a
few
i
did
not
recognize
you
at
yet
i
think
general
that
my
name
was
announced
by
your
servant
in
a
voice
loud
enough
to
prevent
any
doubt
as
to
my
yes
but
he
announced
general
well
well
i
saw
a
man
in
civilian
s
dress
and
though
i
recognized
you
i
doubted
if
it
were
really
for
some
time
past
bernadotte
had
affected
to
wear
civilian
s
dress
in
preference
to
his
uniform
you
know
said
he
laughing
that
i
am
only
half
a
soldier
now
i
was
retired
by
citizen
it
seems
that
it
was
lucky
for
me
that
you
were
no
longer
minister
of
war
when
i
landed
at
how
so
you
said
so
i
was
told
that
had
you
received
the
order
to
arrest
me
for
violating
quarantine
you
would
have
done
i
said
it
and
i
repeat
it
general
as
a
soldier
i
was
always
a
faithful
observer
of
discipline
as
a
minister
i
was
a
slave
to
bonaparte
bit
his
lips
and
will
you
say
after
that
that
you
have
not
a
personal
enmity
to
me
a
personal
enmity
to
you
general
replied
bernadotte
why
should
i
have
we
have
always
gone
together
almost
in
the
same
stride
i
was
even
made
general
before
you
while
my
campaigns
on
the
rhine
were
less
brilliant
than
yours
on
the
adige
they
were
not
less
profitable
for
the
republic
and
when
i
had
the
honor
to
serve
under
you
you
found
in
me
i
hope
a
subordinate
devoted
if
not
to
the
man
at
least
to
the
country
which
he
served
it
is
true
that
since
your
departure
general
i
have
been
more
fortunate
than
you
in
not
having
the
responsibility
of
a
great
army
which
if
one
may
believe
kléber
s
despatches
you
have
left
in
a
disastrous
what
do
you
mean
kléber
s
last
despatches
has
kléber
written
are
you
ignorant
of
that
general
has
the
directory
not
informed
you
of
the
complaints
of
your
successor
that
would
be
a
great
weakness
on
their
part
and
i
congratulate
myself
to
have
come
here
not
only
to
correct
in
your
mind
what
has
been
said
of
me
but
to
tell
you
what
is
being
said
of
bonaparte
fixed
an
eye
darkling
as
an
eagle
s
on
bernadotte
and
what
are
they
saying
of
me
he
asked
they
say
that
as
you
must
come
back
you
should
have
brought
the
army
with
had
i
a
fleet
are
you
unaware
that
de
brueys
allowed
his
to
be
burned
they
also
say
general
that
being
unable
to
bring
back
the
army
it
would
have
been
better
for
your
renown
had
you
remained
with
that
is
what
i
should
have
done
monsieur
if
events
had
not
recalled
me
to
what
events
general
your
pardon
me
general
you
mean
to
say
schérer
s
defeats
yours
as
i
was
not
answerable
for
the
generals
commanding
our
armies
on
the
rhine
and
in
italy
until
i
was
minister
of
war
if
you
will
enumerate
the
victories
and
defeats
since
that
time
you
will
see
on
which
side
the
scale
you
certainly
do
not
intend
to
tell
me
that
matters
are
in
a
good
condition
no
but
i
do
say
that
they
are
not
in
so
desperate
state
as
you
affect
to
as
i
affect
truly
general
to
hear
you
one
would
think
i
had
some
interest
in
lowering
france
in
the
eyes
of
foreigners
i
don
t
say
that
i
say
that
i
wish
to
settle
the
balance
of
our
victories
and
defeats
for
the
last
three
months
and
as
i
came
for
that
and
am
now
in
your
house
and
in
the
position
of
an
accused
person
or
an
as
the
accused
in
the
first
instance
i
and
i
listen
said
bonaparte
visibly
on
thorns
my
ministry
dates
from
the
prairial
the
of
june
if
you
prefer
we
will
not
quarrel
over
which
means
that
we
shall
quarrel
about
bernadotte
continued
without
replying
i
became
minister
as
i
said
the
of
june
that
is
a
short
time
after
the
siege
of
acre
was
bonaparte
bit
his
lips
i
did
not
raise
the
siege
until
after
i
had
ruined
the
fortifications
he
replied
that
is
not
what
kléber
wrote
but
that
does
not
concern
then
he
added
smiling
it
happened
while
clark
was
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
during
which
bonaparte
endeavored
to
make
bernadotte
lower
his
eyes
not
succeeding
he
said
go
bernadotte
bowed
and
continued
perhaps
no
minister
of
war
and
the
archives
of
the
ministry
are
there
for
reference
ever
received
the
portfolio
under
more
critical
circumstances
civil
war
within
a
foreign
enemy
at
our
doors
discouragement
rife
among
our
veteran
armies
absolute
destitution
of
means
to
equip
new
ones
that
was
what
i
had
to
face
on
the
of
june
when
i
entered
upon
my
duties
an
active
correspondence
dating
from
the
of
june
between
the
civil
and
military
authorities
revived
their
courage
and
their
hopes
my
addresses
to
the
armies
this
may
have
been
a
mistake
were
those
not
of
a
minister
to
his
soldiers
but
of
a
comrade
among
comrades
just
as
my
addresses
to
the
administrators
were
those
of
a
citizen
to
his
i
appealed
to
the
courage
of
the
army
and
the
heart
of
the
french
people
i
obtained
all
that
i
had
asked
the
national
guard
reorganized
with
renewed
zeal
legions
were
formed
upon
the
rhine
on
the
moselle
battalions
of
veterans
took
the
place
of
old
regiments
to
reinforce
the
troops
that
were
guarding
our
frontiers
our
cavalry
is
recruited
by
a
remount
of
forty
thousand
horses
and
one
hundred
thousand
conscripts
armed
and
equipped
have
received
with
cries
of
vive
la
republique
the
flags
under
which
they
will
fight
and
conquer
but
interrupted
bonaparte
bitterly
this
is
an
apology
you
are
making
for
be
it
so
i
will
divide
my
discourse
into
two
parts
the
first
will
be
a
contestable
apology
the
second
an
array
of
incontestable
facts
i
will
set
aside
the
apology
and
proceed
to
facts
june
and
the
battle
of
the
trebbia
macdonald
wished
to
fight

another

august
battle
of

this
time
it
was
more
than
a
check
it
was
a
defeat
take
note
of
it
general
for
it
is
the
last
at
the
very
moment
we
were
fighting
at
novi
masséna
was
maintaining
his
position
at
zug
and
lucerne
and
strengthening
himself
on
the

on

separated
from

could
not
rejoin
them
until
after
they
were
driven
beyond

that
series
of
victories
stopped
the
progress
the

had
been
making
since
the
beginning

general
continued
bernadotte
as
france
will
probably
pass
into
your
hands
it
is
well
that
you
should
know
the
state
in
which
you
find
her
and
in
place
of
receipt
our
possessions
bear
witness
to
what
we
are
giving
you
what
we
are
now
doing
general
is
history
and
it
is
important
that
those
who
may
some
day
have
an
interest
in
falsifying
history
shall
find
in
their
path
the
denial
of
is
that
said
for
my
benefit
general
i
say
that
for
flatterers
you
have
pretended
it
is
said
that
you
returned
to
france
because
our
armies
were
destroyed
because
france
was
threatened
the
republic
at
bay
you
may
have
left
egypt
with
that
fear
but
once
in
france
all
such
fears
must
have
given
way
to
a
totally
different
i
ask
no
better
than
to
believe
as
you
do
replied
bonaparte
with
sovereign
dignity
and
the
more
grand
and
powerful
you
prove
france
to
be
the
more
grateful
am
i
to
those
who
have
secured
her
grandeur
and
her
oh
the
result
is
plain
general
three
armies
defeated
the
russians
exterminated
the
austrians
defeated
and
forced
to
fly
twenty
thousand
prisoners
a
hundred
pieces
of

in

nine

so
much
for

the

twice
defeated
utterly
discouraged
abandoning
its
artillery

much
for

forced

lay
down
its

counting

four
thousand

sixteen

mondovi
and
the

much

the

two
hundred
thousand

under
arms
forty
thousand
mounted
cavalry
that
is
my
contingent
mine
and
the
situation
in
but
asked
bonaparte
satirically
if
you
have
as
you
say
two
hundred
thousand
soldiers
under
arms
why
do
you
want
me
to
bring
back
the
fifteen
or
twenty
thousand
men
i
have
in
egypt
who
are
useful
there
as
colonizers
if
i
ask
you
for
them
general
it
is
not
for
any
need
we
may
have
of
them
but
in
the
fear
of
some
disaster
over
taking
what
disaster
do
you
expect
to
befall
them
commanded
by
kléber
kléber
may
be
killed
general
and
who
is
there
behind
kléber
menou
kléber
and
your
twenty
thousand
men
are
doomed
general
how
doomed
yes
the
sultan
will
send
troops
he
controls
by
land
the
english
will
send
their
fleet
they
control
by
sea
we
who
have
neither
land
nor
sea
will
be
compelled
to
take
part
from
here
in
the
evacuation
of
egypt
and
the
capitulation
of
our
army
you
take
a
gloomy
view
of
things
general
the
future
will
show
which
of
us
two
have
seen
things
as
they
what
would
you
have
done
in
my
place
i
don
t
know
but
even
had
i
been
forced
to
bring
them
back
by
way
of
constantinople
i
should
never
have
abandoned
those
whom
france
had
intrusted
to
me
xenophon
on
the
banks
of
the
tigris
was
in
a
much
more
desperate
situation
than
you
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
he
brought
his
ten
thousand
back
to
ionia
and
they
were
not
the
children
of
athens
not
his
fellow
citizens
they
were
mercenaries
from
the
instant
bernadotte
uttered
the
word
constantinople
bonaparte
listened
no
longer
the
name
seemed
to
rouse
a
new
train
of
ideas
in
his
mind
which
he
followed
in
solitary
thought
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
arm
of
the
astonished
bernadotte
and
with
eyes
fixed
on
space
like
a
man
who
pursues
through
space
the
phantom
of
a
vanished
project
he
said
yes
yes
i
thought
of
it
that
is
why
i
persisted
in
taking
that
hovel
acre
here
you
only
thought
it
obstinacy
a
useless
waste
of
men
sacrificed
to
the
of
a
mediocre
general
who
feared
that
he
might
be
blamed
for
a
defeat
what
should
i
have
cared
for
the
raising
of
the
siege
of
acre
if
acre
had
not
been
the
barrier
in
the
way
of
the
grandest
project
ever
conceived
cities
why
good
god
i
could
take
as
many
as
ever
did
alexander
or
cæsar
but
it
was
acre
that
had
to
be
taken
if
i
had
taken
acre
do
you
know
what
i
should
have
done
and
he
fixed
his
burning
eyes
upon
bernadotte
who
this
time
lowered
his
under
the
flame
of
this
genius
what
i
should
have
done
repeated
bonaparte
and
like
ajax
he
seemed
to
threaten
heaven
with
his
clinched
fist
if
i
had
taken
acre
i
should
have
found
the
treasures
of
the
pasha
in
the
city
and
three
thousand
stands
of
arms
with
that
i
should
have
raised
and
armed
all
syria
so
maddened
by
the
ferocity
of
djezzar
that
each
time
i
attacked
him
the
population
prayed
to
god
for
his
overthrow
i
should
have
marched
upon
damascus
and
aleppo
i
should
have
swelled
my
army
with
the
malcontents
advancing
into
the
country
i
should
step
by
step
have
proclaimed
the
abolition
of
slavery
and
the
annihilation
of
the
tyrannical
government
of
the
pashas
i
should
have
overthrown
the
turkish
empire
and
founded
a
great
empire
at
constantinople
which
would
have
fixed
my
place
in
history
higher
than
constantine
and
mohammed
ii
perhaps
i
should
have
returned
to
paris
by
way
of
adrianople
and
vienna
after
annihilating
the
house
of
austria
well
my
dear
general
that
is
the
project
which
that
little
hovel
of
a
acre
rendered
abortive
and
he
so
far
forgot
to
whom
he
was
speaking
as
he
followed
the
shadows
of
his
vanished
dream
that
he
called
bernadotte
my
dear
the
latter
almost
appalled
by
the
magnitude
of
the
project
which
bonaparte
had
unfolded
to
him
made
a
step
backward
yes
said
bernadotte
i
perceive
what
you
want
for
you
have
just
betrayed
yourself
orient
or
occident
a
throne
a
throne
so
be
it
why
not
count
upon
me
to
help
you
conquer
it
but
elsewhere
than
in
france
i
am
a
republican
and
i
will
die
a
bonaparte
shook
his
head
as
if
to
disperse
the
thoughts
which
held
him
in
the
clouds
i
too
am
a
republican
said
he
but
see
what
has
come
of
your
republic
what
matter
cried
bernadotte
it
is
not
to
a
word
or
a
form
that
i
am
faithful
but
to
the
principle
let
the
directors
but
yield
me
the
power
and
i
would
know
how
to
defend
the
republic
against
her
internal
enemies
even
as
i
defended
her
from
her
foreign
as
he
said
these
words
bernadotte
raised
his
eyes
and
his
glance
encountered
that
of
bonaparte
two
naked
blades
clashing
together
never
sent
forth
lightning
more
vivid
more
terrible
josephine
had
watched
the
two
men
for
some
time
past
with
anxious
attention
she
saw
the
dual
glance
teeming
with
reciprocal
menace
she
rose
hastily
and
went
to
bernadotte
general
said
she
bernadotte
bowed
you
are
intimate
with
gohier
are
you
not
she
continued
he
is
one
of
my
best
friends
madame
said
bernadotte
well
we
dine
with
him
the
day
after
the
brumaire
dine
there
yourself
and
bring
madame
bernadotte
i
should
be
so
glad
to
know
her
madame
said
bernadotte
in
the
days
of
the
greeks
you
would
have
been
one
of
the
three
graces
in
the
middle
ages
you
would
have
been
a
fairy
you
are
the
most
adorable
woman
i
and
making
three
steps
backward
and
bowing
he
contrived
to
retire
politely
without
including
bonaparte
in
his
bow
josephine
followed
him
with
her
eyes
until
he
had
left
the
room
then
turning
to
her
husband
she
said
well
it
seems
that
it
was
not
as
successful
with
bernadotte
as
with
moreau
was
it
bold
adventurous
disinterested
sincere
republican
inaccessible
to
seduction
he
is
a
human
obstacle
we
must
make
our
way
around
him
since
we
can
not
overthrow
and
leaving
the
salon
without
taking
leave
of
any
one
he
went
to
his
study
whither
roland
and
bourrienne
followed
they
had
hardly
been
there
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
the
handle
of
the
lock
turned
softly
the
door
opened
and
lucien
appeared
chapter
xxii
the
outline
of
a
decree
lucien
was
evidently
expected
bonaparte
had
not
mentioned
his
name
once
since
entering
the
study
but
in
spite
of
this
silence
he
had
turned
his
head
three
or
four
times
with
increasing
impatience
toward
the
door
and
when
the
young
man
appeared
an
exclamation
of
contentment
escaped
his
lips
lucien
the
general
s
youngest
brother
was
born
in
making
him
now
barely
years
old
since
that
is
at
the
age
of
and
a
half
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
five
hundred
who
to
honor
bonaparte
had
made
him
their
president
with
the
projects
he
had
conceived
nothing
could
have
been
more
fortunate
for
bonaparte
frank
and
loyal
republican
to
the
core
lucien
believed
that
in
seconding
his
brother
s
plans
he
was
serving
the
republic
better
than
the
future
first
consul
in
his
eyes
no
one
was
better
fitted
to
save
it
a
second
time
than
he
who
had
saved
it
the
first
it
was
with
these
sentiments
in
his
heart
that
he
now
came
to
confer
with
his
brother
here
you
are
said
bonaparte
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
so
i
suspected
but
i
was
obliged
to
wait
until
i
could
leave
without
being
did
you
manage
it
yes
talma
was
relating
a
story
about
marat
and
dumouriez
interesting
as
it
was
i
deprived
myself
of
the
pleasure
and
here
i
i
have
just
heard
a
carriage
driving
away
the
person
who
got
in
it
couldn
t
have
seen
you
coming
up
my
private
stairs
could
he
the
person
who
drove
off
was
myself
the
carriage
was
mine
if
that
is
not
seen
every
one
will
think
i
have
bonaparte
breathed
freer
well
said
he
let
us
hear
how
you
have
spent
your
oh
i
haven
t
wasted
my
time
you
may
be
are
we
to
have
a
decree
or
the
council
we
drew
it
up
and
i
have
brought
it
to
you
the
rough
draft
at
least
so
that
you
can
see
if
you
want
anything
added
or
let
me
see
it
cried
bonaparte
taking
the
paper
hastily
from
lucien
s
hand
he
read
art
i
the
legislative
body
is
transferred
to
the
commune
of
the
two
branches
of
the
council
will
hold
their
sessions
in
the
two
wings
of
the
palace
that
s
the
important
article
said
lucien
i
had
it
placed
first
so
that
it
might
strike
the
people
at
yes
yes
exclaimed
bonaparte
and
he
continued
art
ii
they
will
assemble
there
the
brumaire
no
no
said
bonaparte
the
change
the
date
bourrienne
and
he
handed
the
paper
to
his
secretary
you
expect
to
be
ready
for
the
i
shall
be
fouché
said
day
before
yesterday
make
haste
or
i
won
t
answer
for
the
the
brumaire
said
bourrienne
returning
the
paper
to
the
general
bonaparte
resumed
art
ii
they
will
assemble
there
the
brumaire
at
noon
all
deliberations
are
forbidden
elsewhere
and
before
the
above
date
bonaparte
read
the
article
a
second
time
good
said
he
there
is
no
double
meaning
and
he
continued
art
iii
general
bonaparte
is
charged
with
the
enforcement
of
this
decree
he
will
take
all
necessary
measures
for
the
safety
of
the
national
legislature
a
satirical
smile
flickered
on
the
stony
lips
of
the
reader
but
he
continued
almost
immediately
the
general
commanding
the
military
division
the
guard
of
the
legislature
the
stationary
national
guard
the
troops
of
the
line
within
the
boundaries
of
the
commune
of
paris
and
those
in
the
constitutional
arrondissement
and
throughout
the
limits
of
the
said
division
are
placed
directly
under
his
orders
and
are
directed
to
regard
him
as
their
commanding
officer
bourrienne
add
all
citizens
will
lend
him
assistance
when
called
the
bourgeois
love
to
meddle
in
political
matters
and
when
they
really
can
help
us
in
our
projects
we
ought
to
grant
them
this
bourrienne
obeyed
then
he
returned
the
paper
to
the
general
who
went
on
art
iv
general
bonaparte
is
summoned
before
the
council
to
receive
a
copy
of
the
present
decree
and
to
make
oath
thereto
he
will
consult
with
the
inspecting
commissioners
of
both
branches
of
the
council
art
the
present
decree
shall
be
transmitted

posted
and
promulgated
throughout

republic
by
special
messengers
done
at
paris
this
the
date
is
left
blank
said
lucien
put
the
brumaire
bourrienne
the
decree
must
take
everybody
by
surprise
it
must
be
issued
at
seven
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
at
the
same
hour
or
even
earlier
it
must
be
posted
on
all
the
walls
of
but
suppose
the
ancients
won
t
consent
to
issue
it
said
lucien
all
the
more
reason
to
have
it
posted
ninny
said
bonaparte
we
must
act
as
if
it
had
been
am
i
to
correct
this
grammatical
error
in
the
last
paragraph
asked
bourrienne
laughing
where
demanded
lucien
in
the
tone
of
an
aggrieved
author
the
word
immediate
replied
bourrienne
you
can
t
say
transmitted
immediate
it
ought
to
be
it
s
not
worth
while
said
bonaparte
i
shall
act
you
may
be
sure
as
if
it
were
then
after
an
instant
s
reflection
he
added
as
to
what
you
said
just
now
about
their
not
being
willing
to
pass
it
there
s
a
very
simple
way
to
get
it
what
is
to
convoke
the
members
of
whom
we
are
sure
at
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
those
of
whom
we
are
not
sure
at
eight
having
only
our
own
men
it
will
be
devilishly
hard
to
lose
the
but
six
o
clock
for
some
and
eight
for
the
others
objected
lucien
employ
two
secretaries
one
of
them
can
make
a
then
turning
to
lucien
he
said
write
and
walking
up
and
down
he
dictated
without
hesitating
like
a
man
who
has
long
thought
over
and
carefully
prepared
what
he
dictates
stopping
occasionally
beside
bourrienne
to
see
if
the
secretary
s
pen
were
following
his
every
word
citizens
the
council
of
the
ancients
the
trustee
of
the
nation
s
wisdom
has
issued
the
subjoined
decree
it
is
authorized
by
articles
and
of
the
constitution
this
decree
enjoins
me
to
take
measures
for
the
safety
of
the
national
legislature
and
its
necessary
and
momentary
removal
bourrienne
looked
at
bonaparte
was
the
word
the
latter
had
intended
to
use
but
as
the
general
did
not
correct
himself
bourrienne
left
bonaparte
continued
to
dictate
the
legislature
will
find
means
to
avoid
the
imminent
danger
into
which
the
disorganization
of
all
parts
of
the
administration
has
brought
us
but
it
needs
at
this
crisis
the
united
support
and
confidence
of
patriots
rally
around
it
it
offers
the
only
means
of
establishing
the
republic
on
the
bases
of
civil
liberty
internal
prosperity
victory
and
peace
bonaparte
perused
this
proclamation
and
nodded
his
head
in
sign
of
approval
then
he
looked
at
his
watch
eleven
o
clock
he
said
there
is
still
then
seating
himself
in
bourrienne
s
chair
he
wrote
a
few
words
in
the
form
of
a
note
sealed
it
and
wrote
the
address
to
the
citizen
roland
said
he
when
he
had
finished
take
a
horse
out
of
the
stable
or
a
carriage
in
the
street
and
go
to
barras
house
i
have
asked
him
for
an
interview
tomorrow
at
midnight
i
want
an
roland
left
the
room
a
moment
later
the
gallop
of
a
horse
resounded
through
the
courtyard
disappearing
in
the
direction
of
the
rue
du
now
bourrienne
said
bonaparte
after
listening
to
the
sound
at
midnight
whether
i
am
in
the
house
or
not
you
will
take
my
carriage
and
go
in
my
stead
to
in
your
stead
general
yes
he
will
do
nothing
all
day
expecting
me
to
accept
him
on
my
side
at
night
at
midnight
you
will
go
to
him
and
say
that
i
have
such
a
bad
headache
i
have
had
to
go
to
bed
but
that
i
will
be
with
him
at
seven
o
clock
in
the
morning
without
fail
he
will
believe
you
or
he
won
t
believe
you
but
at
any
rate
it
will
be
too
late
for
him
to
act
against
us
by
seven
in
the
morning
i
shall
have
ten
thousand
men
under
my
very
good
general
have
you
any
other
orders
for
me
no
not
this
evening
replied
bonaparte
be
here
early
and
i
asked
lucien
see
sièyes
he
has
the
ancients
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
make
all
your
arrangements
with
him
i
don
t
wish
him
to
be
seen
here
nor
to
be
seen
myself
at
his
house
if
by
any
chance
we
fail
he
is
a
man
to
repudiate
after
tomorrow
i
wish
to
be
master
of
my
own
actions
and
to
have
no
ties
with
any
do
you
think
you
will
need
me
come
back
at
night
and
report
what
are
you
going
back
to
the
salon
no
i
shall
wait
for
josephine
in
her
own
room
bourrienne
tell
her
as
you
pass
through
to
get
rid
of
the
people
as
soon
as
then
saluting
bourrienne
and
his
brother
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
he
left
his
study
by
a
private
corridor
and
went
to
josephine
s
room
there
lighted
by
a
single
alabaster
lamp
which
made
the
conspirator
s
brow
seem
paler
than
ever
bonaparte
listened
to
the
noise
of
the
carriages
as
one
after
the
other
they
rolled
away
at
last
the
sounds
ceased
and
five
minutes
later
the
door
opened
to
admit
josephine
she
was
alone
and
held
a
candlestick
in
her
hand
her
face
lighted
by
the
double
flame
expressed
the
keenest
anxiety
well
bonaparte
inquired
what
ails
you
i
am
afraid
said
josephine
of
what
those
fools
of
the
directory
or
the
lawyers
of
the
two
councils
come
come
i
have
sièyes
with
me
in
the
ancients
and
lucien
in
the
five
then
all
goes
well
wonderfully
so
you
sent
me
word
that
you
were
waiting
for
me
here
and
i
feared
you
had
some

lovingly
and

said
bonaparte
there
s
midnight
in
fact
another
day
had
fallen
into
the
gulf
of
time
the
clock
chimed
twelve
bonaparte
listened
gravely
and
dreamily
hours
only
separated
him
from
the
solemn
day
for
which
he
had
been
scheming
for
a
month
and
of
which
he
had
dreamed
for
years
let
us
do
now
what
he
would
so
gladly
have
done
and
spring
over
those
hours
intervening
to
the
day
which
history
has
not
yet
judged
and
see
what
happened
in
various
parts
of
paris
where
the
events
we
are
about
to
relate
produced
an
overwhelming
sensation
chapter

alea
jacta
est
at
seven
in
the
morning
fouché
minister
of
police
entered
the
bedroom
of
gohier
president
of
the
directory
oh
ho
said
gohier
when
he
saw
him
what
has
happened
now
monsieur
le
ministre
to
give
me
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
so
early
don
t
you
know
about
the
decree
asked
fouché
what
decree
asked
honest
gohier
the
decree
of
the
council
of
the
when
was
it
issued
last
so
the
council
of
the
ancients
assembles
at
night
now
when
matters
are
urgent
and
what
does
the
decree
it
transfers
the
legislative
sessions
to
gohier
felt
the
blow
he
realized
the
advantage
which
bonaparte
s
daring
genius
might
obtain
by
this
isolation
and
since
when
he
asked
fouché
is
the
minister
of
police
transformed
into
a
messenger
of
the
council
of
the
ancients
that
s
where
you
are
mistaken
citizen
president
replied
the
i
am
more
than
ever
minister
of
police
this
morning
for
i
have
come
to
inform
you
of
an
act
which
may
have
the
most
serious
not
being
as
yet
sure
of
how
the
conspiracy
of
the
rue
de
la
victoire
would
turn
out
fouché
was
not
averse
to
keeping
open
a
door
for
retreat
at
the
luxembourg
but
gohier
honest
as
he
was
knew
the
man
too
well
to
be
his
dupe
you
should
have
informed
me
of
this
decree
yesterday
and
not
this
morning
for
in
making
the
communication
now
you
are
scarcely
in
advance
of
the
official
communication
i
shall
probably
receive
in
a
few
as
he
spoke
an
usher
opened
the
door
and
informed
the
president
that
a
messenger
from
the
inspectors
of
the
council
of
the
ancients
was
there
and
asked
to
make
him
a
communication
let
him
come
in
said
gohier
the
messenger
entered
and
handed
the
president
a
letter
he
broke
the
seal
hastily
and
read
citizen
president
the
inspecting
commission
hasten
to
inform
you
of
a
decree
removing
the
residence
of
the
legislative
body
to
the
decree
will
be
forwarded
to
you
but
measures
for
public
safety
are
at
present
occupying
our
attention
we
invite
you
to
meet
the
commission
of
the
ancients
you
will
find
sièyes
and
ducos
already
there
fraternal
greetings
barillon
fargues
cornet
very
good
said
gohier
dismissing
the
messenger
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
the
messenger
went
out
gohier
turned
to
fouché
ah
said
he
the
plot
is
well
laid
they
inform
me
of
the
decree
but
they
do
not
send
it
to
me
happily
you
are
here
to
tell
me
the
terms
of
but
said
fouché
i
don
t
know
what
do
you
the
minister
of
police
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
know
nothing
about
this
extraordinary
session
of
the
council
of
the
ancients
when
it
has
been
put
on
record
by
a
decree
of
course
i
knew
it
took
place
but
i
was
unable
to
be
and
you
had
no
secretary
no
amanuensis
to
send
who
could
give
you
an
account
word
for
word
of
this
session
when
in
all
probability
this
session
will
dispose
of
the
fate
of
france
ah
citizen
fouché
you
are
either
a
very
deep
or
a
very
shallow
minister
of
police
have
you
any
orders
to
give
me
citizen
president
asked
fouché
none
citizen
minister
replied
the
president
if
the
directory
judges
it
advisable
to
issue
any
orders
it
will
be
to
men
whom
it
esteems
worthy
of
its
confidence
you
may
return
to
those
who
sent
you
he
added
turning
his
back
upon
the
minister
fouché
went
and
gohier
immediately
rang
his
bell
an
usher
entered
go
to
barras
sièyes
ducos
and
moulins
and
request
them

letter
inviting
us
to

with

minutes
later
madame
gohier
entered
fully
dressed
with
the
note
in
her
hand
the
invitation
was
for
eight
o
clock
it
was
then
seven
and
it
would
take
at
least
twenty
minutes
to
drive
from
the
luxembourg
to
the
rue
de
la
victoire
here
it
is
my
dear
said
madame
gohier
handing
the
letter
to
her
husband
it
says
eight
o
yes
replied
gohier
i
was

in
doubt
about
the
hour
but
about
the
taking
the
note
from
his
wife
s
hand
he
read
it
over
come

dear
gohier
with
your
wife
and

asked
madame
gohier
you
are
but
not
i
an
event
has
just
happened
about
which
the
citizen
bonaparte
is
probably
which
will
detain
my
colleagues
and
myself
at
the
a
serious
event
then
i
shall
stay
with
no
indeed
you
would
not
be
of

added
now
as
she
turned
round
madame
gohier
came
face
to
face
with
general
moulins
he
for
his
character
was
naturally
impetuous
seemed
furious
pardon
me
citizeness
he
said
then
rushing
into
gohier

study
he
cried

as
soon
as
he
is
out
of

the
two
directors
left
the
room
and
hurried
toward
barras
apartment
they
found
him
actually
in
his
bath
but
they
insisted
on
entering
well
asked
barras
as
soon
as
he
saw
them
have
you
heard
absolutely
they
told
him
what
they
themselves
knew
ah
cried
barras
that
explains
what
do
you
mean
yes

is
why
he
didn
t
come
last
who
why
did
you
expect
him
last
evening
he
sent
me
word
by
one
of
his
that
he
would
call
on
me
at
eleven
o
clock
last
and
he
didn
t
come
no
he
sent
bourrienne
in
his
carriage
to
tell
me
that
a
violent
headache
had
obliged
him
to
go
to
bed
but
that
he
would
be
here
early
this
the
directors
looked
at
each
other
the
whole
thing
is
plain
said
they
i
have
sent
bollot
my
secretary
a
very
intelligent
fellow
to
find
out
what
he
can
continued
barras
he
rang
and
a
servant
entered
as
soon
as
citizen

barras
ask
him
to
come
he
is
just
getting
out
of
his

the
three
directors

bonaparte
in
full
uniform
accompanied
by
generals
beurnonville
macdonald
and
moreau
are
on
their
way
to
the
tuileries
where
ten
thousand
troops
are
awaiting
moreau
moreau
with
him
exclaimed
gohier
on
his
right
i
always
told
you
that
moreau
was
a
sneak
and
nothing
else
cried
moulins
with
military
roughness
are
you
still
determined
to
resist
barras
asked
gohier
yes
replied
barras
then
dress
yourself
and
join
us
in
the
go
said
barras
i
follow
the
two
directors
hastened
to
the
after
waiting
ten
minutes
moulins
said
we
should
have
waited
for
barras
if
moreau
is
a
sneak
barras
is
a
two
hours
later
they
were
still
waiting
for
barras
talleyrand
and
bruix
had
been
admitted
to
barras
bathroom
just
after
gohier
and
moulins
had
left
it
and
in
talking
with
them
barras
forgot
his
appointment
we
will
now
see
what
was
happening
in
the
rue
de
la
victoire
at
seven
o
clock
contrary
to
his
usual
custom
bonaparte
was
up
and
waiting
in
full
uniform
in
his
bedroom
roland
entered
bonaparte
was
perfectly
calm
they
were
on
the
eve
of
a
battle
has
no
one
come
yet
roland
he
asked
no
general
replied
the
young
man
but
i
heard
the
roll
of
a
carriage
just
so
did
i
replied
bonaparte
at
that
minute
a
servant
announced
the
citizen
joseph
bonaparte
and
the
citizen
general
roland
questioned
bonaparte
with
a
glance
was
he
to
go
or
stay
he
was
to
stay
roland
took
his
stand
at
the
corner
of
a
bookcase
like
a
sentinel
at
his
post
ah
ha
exclaimed
bonaparte
seeing
that
bernadotte
was
still
attired
in
civilian
s
clothes
you
seem
to
have
a
positive
horror
of
the
uniform
general
why
the
devil
should
i
be
in
uniform
at
seven
in
the
morning
asked
bernadotte
when
i
am
not
in
active
service
you
will
be
but
i
am
yes
but
i
recall
you
to
active
you
yes
in
the
name
of
the
directory
is
there
still
a
directory
still
a
directory
what
do
you
mean
didn
t
you
see
the
troops
drawn
up
in
the
streets
leading
to
the
tuileries
as
you
came
here
i
saw
them
and
i
was
those
soldiers
are
excuse
me
said
bernadotte
i
thought
they
belonged
to
oh
to
france
or
to
me
is
it
not
all
one
i
was
not
aware
of
that
replied
bernadotte
coldly
though
you
doubt
it
now
you
will
be
certain
of
it
tonight
come
bernadotte
this
is
the
vital
moment
decide
general
replied
bernadotte
i
am
fortunate
enough
to
be
at
this
moment
a
simple
citizen
let
me
remain
a
simple
bernadotte
take
care
he
that
is
not
for
me
is
against
general
pay
attention
to
your
words
you
said
just
now
take
if
that
is
a
threat
you
know
very
well
that
i
do
not
fear
bonaparte
came
up
to
him
and
took
him
by
both
hands
oh
yes
i
know
that
that
is
why
i
must
have
you
with
me
i
not
only
esteem
you
bernadotte
but
i
love
you
i
leave
you
with
joseph
he
is
your
between
brothers
devil
take
it
there
should
be
no
where
are
you
going
in
your
character
of
spartan
you
are
a
rigid
observer
of
the
laws
are
you
not
well
here
is
a
decree
issued
by
the
council
of
five
hundred
last
night
which
confers
upon
me
the
immediate
command
of
the
troops
in
paris
so
i
was
right
he
added
when
i
told
you
that
the
soldiers
you
met
were
mine
inasmuch
as
they
are
under
my
and
he
placed
in
bernadotte
s
hands
the
copy
of
the
decree
which
had
been
sent
to
him
at
six
o
clock
that
morning
bernadotte
read
it
through
from
the
first
line
to
the
last
to
this
said
he
i
have
nothing
to
object
secure
the
safety
of
the
national
legislature
and
all
good
citizens
will
be
with
then
be
with
me
permit
me
general
to
wait
hours
to
see
how
you
fulfil
that
devil
of
a
man
cried
bonaparte
have
your
own
then
taking
him
by
the
arm
he
dragged
him
a
few
steps
apart
from
joseph
and
continued
bernadotte
i
want
to
play
with
why
so
retorted
the
latter
since
i
am
not
on
your
side
never
mind
you
are
watching
the
game
and
i
want
the
to
see
that
i
am
not
do
you
bind
me
to
secrecy
that
is
well
for
in
that
case
i
should
have
refused
to
listen
to
your
oh
my
confidences
are
not
long
your
directory
is
detested
your
constitution
is
you
must
make
a
clean
sweep
of
both
and
turn
the
government
in
another
direction
you
don
t
answer
i
am
waiting
to
hear
what
you
have
to
all
i
have
to
say
is
go
put
on
your
uniform
i
can
t
wait
any
longer
for
you
join
me
at
the
tuileries
among
our
bernadotte
shook
his
head
you
think
you
can
count
on
moreau
beurnonville
and
lefebvre
resumed
bonaparte
just
look
out
of
that
window
who
do
you
see
there
and
there
moreau
and
beurnonville
as
for
lefebvre
i
do
not
see
him
but
i
am
certain
i
shall
not
go
a
hundred
steps
before
meeting
him
now
will
you
decide
general
replied
bernadotte
i
am
not
a
man
to
be
swayed
by
example
least
of
all
when
that
example
is
bad
moreau
beurnonville
and
lefebvre
may
do
as
they
wish
i
shall
do
as
i
ought
so
you
definitively
refuse
to
accompany
me
to
the
tuileries
i
do
not
wish
to
take
part
in
a
a
rebellion
a
rebellion
against
whom
against
a
parcel
of
imbeciles
who
are
pettifogging
from
morning
till
night
in
their
these
imbeciles
general
are
for
the
moment
the
representatives
of
the
law
the
constitution
protects
them
they
are
sacred
to
at
least
promise
me
one
thing
iron
rod
that
you
what
is
it
to
keep
i
will
keep
quiet
as
a
citizen
but
but
what
come
i
made
a
clean
breast
of
it
to
you
do
you
do
but
if
the
directory
orders
me

bernadotte
smiling
faith
said
bonaparte

of
politics
and

of
your
refusal
i
shall
expect

at
the
tuileries
hark
our
friends
are
becoming
they
were
shouting
vive
bonaparte
bernadotte
paled
slightly
bonaparte
noticed
this
pallor
ah
ha
he
muttered
jealous
i
was
mistaken
he
is
not
a
spartan
he
is
an
athenian
as
bonaparte
had
said
his
friends
were
growing
impatient
during
the
hour
that
had
elapsed
since
the
decree
had
been
posted
the
salon
the
anterooms
and
the
courtyard
had
been
crowded
the
first
person
bonaparte
met
at
the
head
of
the
staircase
was
his
compatriot
colonel
sebastiani
then
commanding
the
dragoons
ah
is
that
you
sebastiani
said
bonaparte
where
are
your
men
in
line
along
the
rue
de
la
victoire
well
disposed
enthusiastic
i
distributed
among
them
ten
thousand
cartridges
which
i
had
in
yes
but
you
had
no
right
to
draw
those
cartridges
out
without
an
order
from
the
commandant
of
paris
do
you
know
that
you
have
burned
your
vessels
sebastiani
then
take
me
into
yours
general
i
have
faith
in
your
you
mistake
me
for
cæsar
sebastiani
faith
i
might
make
worse
mistakes
besides
down
below
in
the
courtyard
there
are
forty
officers
or
more
of
all
classes
without
pay
whom
the
directory
has
left
in
the
most
complete
destitution
for
the
last
year
you
are
their
only
hope
general
they
are
ready
to
die
for
that
s
right
go
to
your
regiment
and
take
leave
of
take
leave
of
it
what
do
you
mean
general
i
exchange
it
for
a
brigade
go
go
sebastiani
did
not
wait
to
be
told
twice
bonaparte
continued
his
way
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
he
met
lefebvre
here
i
am
general
said
lefebvre
you
and
where
is
the
military
division
i
am
waiting
for
my
appointment
to
bring
it
into
haven
t
you
received
your
appointment
from
the
directory
yes
but
as
i
am
not
a
traitor
i
have
just
sent
in
my
resignation
so
that
they
may
know
i
am
not
to
be
counted
and
you
have
come
for
me
to
appoint
you
so
that
i
may
count
on
you
is
that
it
quick
roland
a
blank
commission
fill
in
the
general
s
name
so
that
i
shall
only
have
to
put
my
name
to
it
i
ll
sign
it
on
the
pommel
of
my
that
s
the
true
sort
said
lefebvre
the
young
man
who
had
already
started
obediently
came
back
to
the
general
fetch
me
that
pair
of
pistols
on
my
at
the
same
time
said
bonaparte
in
a
low
tone
one
never
knows
what
may
yes
general
said
roland
besides
i
shan
t
leave
unless
i
send
you
to
be
killed
true
replied
the
young
man
hastening
away
to
fulfil
his
double
errand
bonaparte
was
continuing
on
his
way
when
he
noticed
a
shadow
in
the
corridor
he
recognized
josephine
and
ran
to
her
good
god
cried
she
is
there
so
much
danger
what
makes
you
think
that
i
overheard
the
order
you
gave
serves
you
right
for
listening
at
doors
how
about
gohier
he
hasn
t
nor
his
wife
she
is
bonaparte
pushed
josephine
aside
with
his
hand
and
entered
the
salon
he
found
madame
gohier
alone
and
very
pale
what
said
he
without
any
preamble
isn
t
the
president
coming
he
was
unable
to
do
so
general
replied
madame
gohier
bonaparte
repressed
a
movement
of
impatience
he
absolutely
must
come
said
he
write
him
that
i
await
him
and
i
will
have
the
note
thank
you
general
replied
madame
gohier
my
servants
are
here
and
they
can
attend
to
write
my
dear
friend
write
said
josephine
offering
her
paper
and
pen
and
ink
bonaparte
stood
so
that
he
could
see
over
her
shoulder
what
she
wrote
madame
gohier
looked
fixedly
at
him
and
he
drew
back
with
a
bow
she
wrote
the
note
folded
it
and
looked
about
her
for
the
but
whether
by
accident
or
intention
there
was
none
sealing
the
note
with
a
wafer
she
rang
the
bell
a
servant
came
give
this
note
to
comtois
said
madame
gohier
and
bid
him
take
it
to
the
luxembourg
at
bonaparte
followed
the
servant
or
rather
the
letter
with
his
eyes
until
the
door
closed
then
turning
to
madame
gohier
he
said
i
regret
that
i
am
unable
to
breakfast
with
you
but
if
the
president
has
business
to
attend
to
so
have
i
you
must
breakfast
with
my
wife
good
appetite
to
you
and
he
went
out
at
the
door
he
met
roland
here
is
the
commission
general
said
the
young
man
and
a
bonaparte
took
the
pen
and
using
the
back
of
his
s
hat
he
signed
the
commission
roland
gave
him
the
pistols
did
you
look
to
them
asked
bonaparte
roland
smiled
don
t
be
uneasy
said
he
i
ll
answer
for
bonaparte
slipped
the
pistols
in
his
belt
murmuring
as
he
did
so
i
wish
i
knew
what
she
wrote
her
i
can
tell
you
word
for
word
what
she
wrote
general
said
a
voice
close
by
you
bourrienne
yes
she
wrote
you
did
right
not
to
come
my
dear
all
that
is
happening
here
convinces
me
that
the
invitation
was
only
a
snare
i
will
rejoin
you
you
unsealed
the
letter
general
sextus
pompey
gave
a
dinner
on
his
galley
to
antony
and
lepidus
his
freedman
said
to
him
shall
i
make
you
emperor
of
the
world
how
can
you
do
it
easily
i
will
cut
the
cable
of
your
galley
and
antony
and
lepidus
are
you
should
have
done
so
without
telling
me
replied
sextus
now
i
charge
you
on
your
life
not
to
do
i
remembered
those
words
general
should
have
done
so
without
telling
bonaparte
thought
an
instant
then
he
said
you
are
mistaken
it
was
octavius
and
not
antony
who
was
on
sextus
galley
with
and
he
went
on
his
way
to
the
courtyard
confining
his
blame
to
the
historical
blunder
hardly
had
the
general
appeared
on
the
portico
than
cries
of
vive
bonaparte
echoed
through
the
courtyard
into
the
street
where
they
were
taken
up
by
the
dragoons
drawn
up
in
line
before
the
gate
that
s
a
good
omen
general
said
roland
yes
give
lefebvre
his
commission
at
once
and
if
he
has
no
horse
let
him
take
one
of
mine
tell
him
to
meet
me
in
the
court
of
the
his
division
is
already
all
the
more
glancing
about
him
bonaparte
saw
moreau
and
beurnonville
who
were
waiting
for
him
their
horses
held
by
orderlies
he
saluted
them
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
already
that
of
a
master
rather
than
that
of
a
comrade
then
perceiving
general
debel
out
of
uniform
he
went
down
the
steps
and
approached
him
why
are
you
in
civilian
s
dress
he
asked
general
i
was
not
notified
i
chanced
to
be
passing
along
the
street
and
seeing
the
crowd
before
your
house
i
came
in
fearing
you
might
be
in
go
and
put
on
your
uniform
but
i
live
the
other
side
of
paris
it
would
take
too
but
nevertheless
he
made
as
if
to
retire
what
are
you
going
to
do
don
t
be
alarmed
debel
had
noticed
an
artilleryman
on
horseback
who
was
about
his
size
friend
said
he
i
am
general
debel
by
order
of
general
bonaparte
lend
me
your
uniform
and
your
horse
and
i
ll
give
you
furlough
for
the
day
here
s
a
louis
to
drink
the
health
of
the
come
to
my
house
for
your
horse
and
uniform
i
live
in
the
rue
no
will
nothing
be
done
to
me
yes
you
shall
be
made
a
good
said
the
artilleryman
and
he
quickly
handed
over
his
uniform
and
horse
to
general
debel
in
the
meantime
bonaparte
heard
talking
above
him
he
raised
his
head
and
saw
joseph
and
bernadotte
at
a
window
once
more
general
he
said
to
bernadotte
will
you
come
with
me
no
said
the
latter
firmly
then
lowering
his
tone
he
continued
you
told
me
just
now
to
take
well
i
say
to
you
take
of
what
you
are
going
to
the
tuileries
of
the
tuileries
are
very
near
the
place
de
la
pooh
retorted
bonaparte
the
guillotine
has
been
moved
to
the
barrière
du
never
mind
the
brewer
santerre
still
controls
the
faubourg
and
santerre
is
moulins
santerre
has
been
warned
that
at
the
first
inimical
movement
he
attempts
i
will
have
him
shot
will
you
come
as
you
please
you
are
separating
your
fortunes
from
mine
i
do
not
separate
mine
from
then
calling
to
his
orderly
he
said
my
horse
they
brought
his
horse
seeing
an
artillery
private
near
him
he
said
what
are
you
doing
among
the
epaulets
the
artilleryman
began
to
laugh
don
t
you
recognize
me
general
he
asked
faith
it
s
debel
where
did
you
get
that
horse
and
the
uniform
from
that
artilleryman
you
see
standing
there
in
his
shirt
it
will
cost
you
a
corporal
s
you
are
wrong
debel
said
bonaparte
it
will
cost
me
two
commissions
one
for
the
corporal
and
one
for
the
general
of
division
forward
march
gentlemen
we
are
going
to
the
and
bending
forward
on
his
horse
as
he
usually
did
his
left
hand
holding
a
slack
rein
his
right
resting
on
his
hip
with
bent
head
and
dreamy
eyes
he
made
his
first
steps
along
that
incline
at
once
glorious
and
fatal
which
was
to
lead
him
to
a
throne
and
to
helena
chapter
xxiv
the
eighteenth
brumaire
on
entering
the
rue
de
la
victoire
bonaparte
found
sebastiani
s
dragoons
drawn
up
in
line
of
battle
he
wished
to
address
them
but
they
interrupted
him
at
the
first
words
shouting
we
want
no
explanations
we
know
that
you
seek
only
the
good
of
the
republic
vive
bonaparte
the
cortège
followed
the
streets
which
led
from
the
rue
de
la
victoire
to
the
tuileries
amid
the
cries
of
vive
bonaparte
general
lefebvre
according
to
promise
was
waiting
at
the
palace
gates
bonaparte
on
his
arrival
at
the
tuileries
was
hailed
with
the
same
cheers
that
had
accompanied
him
once
there
he
raised
his
head
and
shook
it
perhaps
this
cry
of
vive
bonaparte
did
not
satisfy
him
was
he
already
dreaming
of
vive
napoleon
he
advanced
in
front
of
the
troop
surrounded
by
his
staff
and
read
the
decree
of
the
five
hundred
which
transferred
the
sessions
of
the
legislature
to
and
gave
him
the
command
of
the
armed
forces
then
either
from
memory
or
offhand
bonaparte
never
admitted
any
one
to
such
secrets
instead
of
the
proclamation
he
had
dictated
to
bourrienne
two
days
earlier
he
pronounced
these
words
soldiers
the
council
of
ancients
has
given
me
the
command
of
the
city
and
the
army
i
have
accepted
it
to
second
the
measures
to
be
adopted
for
the
good
of
the
people
the
republic
has
been
ill
governed
for
two
years
you
have
hoped
for
my
return
to
put
an
end
to
many
evils
you
celebrated
it
with
a
unanimity
which
imposes
obligations
that
i
now
fulfil
fulfil
yours
and
second
your
general
with
the
vigor
firmness
and
strength
i
have
always
found
in
you
liberty
victory
and
peace
will
restore
the
french
republic
to
the
rank
it
occupied
in
europe
which
ineptitude
and
treason
alone
caused
her
to
lose
the
soldiers
applauded
frantically
it
was
a
declaration
of
war
against
the
directory
and
soldiers
will
always
applaud
a
declaration
of
war
the
general
dismounted
amid
shouts
and
bravos
and
entered
the
tuileries
it
was
the
second
time
he
had
crossed
the
threshold
of
this
palace
of
the
valois
whose
arches
had
so
the
crown
and
head
of
the
last
bourbon
who
had
reigned
there
beside
him
walked
citizen
roederer
bonaparte
started
as
he
recognized
him
and
said
ah
citizen
roederer
you
were
here
on
the
morning
of
august
yes
general
replied
the
future
count
of
the
empire
it
was
you
who
advised
louis
xvi
to
go
before
the
national
bad
advice
citizen
roederer
i
should
not
have
followed
we
advise
men
according
to
what
we
know
of
them
i
would
not
give
general
bonaparte
the
same
advice
i
gave
king
louis
xvi
when
a
king
has
the
fact
of
his
flight
to
varennes
and
the
of
june
behind
him
it
is
difficult
to
save
as
roederer
said
these
words
they
reached
a
window
opening
on
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
bonaparte
stopped
and
seizing
roederer
by
the
arm
he
said
on
the
of
june
i
was
there
pointing
with
his
finger
to
the
terrace
by
the
water
behind
the
third
linden
through
the
open
window
i
could
see
the
poor
king
with
the
red
cap
on
his
head
it
was
a
piteous
sight
i
pitied
what
did
you
do
nothing
i
could
do
nothing
i
was
only
a
lieutenant
of
artillery
but
i
longed
to
go
in
like
the
others
and
whisper
sire
give
me
four
cannon
and
i
ll
sweep
the
whole
rabble
what
would
have
happened
if
lieutenant
bonaparte
had
followed
his
impulse
obtained
what
he
wanted
from
louis
and
the
rabble
that
is
to
say
the
people
of
paris
had
his
cannon
made
a
clean
sweep
on
june
would
he
have
had
to
make
another
the
vendemiaire
for
the
benefit
of
the
convention
while
the
who
had
grown
grave
was
outlining
in
his
mind
the
opening
pages
of
his
future
history
of
the
consulate
bonaparte
presented
himself
at
the
bar
of
the
council
of
the
ancients
followed
by
his
staff
and
by
all
those
who
chose
to
do
likewise
when
the
tumult
caused
by
this
influx
of
people
had
subsided
the
president
read
over
the
decree
which
invested
bonaparte
with
the
military
power
then
after
requesting
him
to
take
the
oath
the
president
added
he
who
has
never
promised
his
country
a
victory
which
he
did
not
win
can
not
fail
to
keep
religiously
his
new
promise
to
serve
her
bonaparte
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
said
solemnly
i
swear
it
all
the
generals
repeated
after
him
each
for
himself
i
swear
it
the
last
one
had
scarcely
finished
when
bonaparte
recognized
barras
secretary
that
same
bollot
of
whom
barras
had
spoken
that
morning
to
his
two
colleagues
he
had
come
there
solely
to
give
his
patron
an
account
of
all
that
was
happening
there
but
bonaparte
fancied
he
was
sent
on
some
secret
mission
by
barras
he
resolved
to
spare
him
the
first
advance
and
went
straight
to
him
saying
have
you
come
on
behalf
of
the
directors
then
without
giving
him
time
to
answer
he
continued
what
have
they
done
with
that
france
i
left
so
brilliant
i
left
peace
i
find
war
i
left
victories
i
find
reverses
i
left
the
millions
of
italy
and
i
find
spoliation
and
penury
what
have
become
of
the
hundred
thousand
frenchmen
whom
i
knew
by
name
they
are
dead
it
was
not
precisely
to
barras
secretary
that
these
words
should
have
been
said
but
bonaparte
wished
to
say
them
needed
to
say
them
and
little
he
cared
to
whom
he
said
them
perhaps
even
from
his
point
of
view
it
was
better
to
say
them
to
some
one
who
could
not
answer
him
at
that
moment
sièyes
rose
citizens
said
he
the
directors
moulins
and
gohier
ask
to
be
they
are
no
longer
directors
said
bonaparte
for
there
is
no
longer
a
but
objected
sièyes
they
have
not
yet
sent
in
their
then
admit
them
and
let
them
give
it
retorted
bonaparte
moulins
and
gohier
entered
they
were
pale
but
calm
they
knew
they
came
to
force
a
struggle
but
behind
their
resistance
may
have
loomed
the
sinnamary
the
exiles
they
sent
there
the
of
fructidor
pointed
the
way
i
see
with
satisfaction
bonaparte
hastened
to
say
that
you
have
yielded
to
our
wishes
and
those
of
your
two
gohier
made
a
step
forward
and
said
firmly
we
yield
neither
to
your
wishes
nor
to
those
of
our
two
colleagues
who
are
no
longer
our
colleagues
since
they
have
resigned
but
to
the
law
it
requires
that
the
decree
transferring
the
legislative
body
to
shall
be
proclaimed
without
delay
we
have
come
here
to
fulfil
the
duty
which
the
law
imposes
on
us
fully
determined
to
defend
it
against
all
factious
persons
whoever
they
may
be
who
attempt
to
attack
your
zeal
does
not
astonish
us
replied
bonaparte
and
because
you
are
a
man
who
loves
his
country
you
will
unite
with
unite
with
you
and
why
to
save
the
to
save
the
republic
there
was
a
time
general
when
you
had
the
honor
to
be
its
prop
but
the
glory
of
saving
it
is
reserved
for
you
save
it
retorted
bonaparte
how
will
you
do
that
with
the
means
your
constitution
gives
you
why
that
constitution
is
crumbling
on
all
sides
and
even
if
i
did
not
topple
it
over
it
could
not
last
eight
ah
cried
moulins
at
last
you
avow
your
hostile
my
intentions
are
not
hostile
shouted
bonaparte
striking
the
floor
with
the
heel
of
his
boot
the
republic
is
in
peril
it
must
be
saved
and
i
shall
do
you
do
it
cried
gohier
it
seems
to
me
it
is
for
the
directory
not
you
to
say
i
shall
do
it
there
is
no
longer
a
i
did
indeed
hear
that
you
said
so
just
a
moment
before
we
came
there
is
no
longer
a
directory
now
that
sièyes
and
ducos
have
you
are
mistaken
so
long
as
there
are
three
directors
the
directory
still
exists
neither
moulins
barras
nor
myself
have
handed
in
our
at
that
moment
a
paper
was
slipped
in
bonaparte
s
hand
and
a
voice
said
in
his
ear
read
he
did
so
then
said
aloud
you
yourself
are
mistaken
barras
has
resigned
for
here
is
his
resignation
the
law
requires
three
directors
to
make
a
directory
you
are
but
two
and
as
you
said
just
now
whoever
resists
the
law
is
a
then
handing
the
paper
to
the
president
he
continued
add
the
citizen
barras
resignation
to
that
of
citizens
sièyes
and
ducos
and
proclaim
the
fall
of
the
directory
i
will
announce
it
to
my
moulins
and
gohier
were
confounded
barras
resignation
sapped
the
foundations
of
all
their
plans
bonaparte
had
nothing
further
to
do
at
the
council
of
ancients
but
there
still
remained
much
to
be
done
in
the
court
of
the
tuileries
he
went
down
followed
by
those
who
had
accompanied
him
up
his
soldiers
no
sooner
caught
sight
of
him
than
they
burst
into
shouts
of
vive
bonaparte
more
noisily
and
more
eagerly
than
ever
he
sprang
into
his
saddle
and
made
them
a
sign
that
he
wished
to
speak
to
them
ten
thousand
voices
that
had
burst
into
cries
were
hushed
in
a
moment
silence
fell
as
if
by
enchantment
soldiers
said
bonaparte
in
a
voice
so
loud
that
all
could
hear
it
your
comrades
in
arms
on
the
frontiers
are
denuded
of
the
necessaries
of
life
the
people
are
miserable
the
authors
of
these
evils
are
the
factious
men
against
whom
i
have
assembled
you
i
hope
before
long
to
lead
you
to
victory
but
first
we
must
deprive
those
who
would
stand
in
the
way
of
public
order
and
general
prosperity
of
their
power
to
do
whether
it
was
weariness
of
the
government
of
the
directory
or
the
fascination
exercised
by
the
magic
being
who
called
them
to
victory
so
long
forgotten
in
his
absence
shouts
of
enthusiasm
arose
and
like
a
train
of
burning
powder
spread
from
the
tuileries
to
the
carrousel
from
the
carrousel
to
the
adjacent
streets
bonaparte
profited
by
this
movement
turning
to
moreau
he
said
general
i
will
give
you
proof
of
the
immense
confidence
i
have
in
you
bernadotte
whom
i
left
at
my
house
and
who
refused
to
follow
us
had
the
audacity
to
tell
me
that
if
he
received
orders
from
the
directory
he
should
execute
them
against
whosoever
the
agitators
might
be
general
i
confide
to
you
the
guardianship
of
the
luxembourg
the
tranquillity
of
paris
and
the
welfare
of
the
republic
are
in
your
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
he
put
his
horse
to
a
gallop
and
rode
off
to
the
opposite
end
of
the
line
moreau
led
by
military
ambition
had
consented
to
play
a
part
in
this
great
drama
he
was
now
forced
to
accept
that
which
the
author
assigned
him
on
returning
to
the
louvre
gohier
and
moulins
found
nothing
changed
apparently
all
the
sentries
were
at
their
posts
they
retired
to
one
of
the
salons
of
the
presidency
to
consult
together
but
they
had
scarcely
begun
their
conference
when
general
jubé
the
commandant
of
the
luxembourg
received
orders
to
join
bonaparte
at
the
tuileries
with
the
guard
of
the
directory
their
places
were
filled
by
moreau
and
a
portion
of
the
soldiers
who
had
been
electrified
by
bonaparte
nevertheless
the
two
directors
drew
up
a
message
for
the
council
of
the
five
hundred
in
which
they
protested
energetically
against
what
had
been
done
when
this
was
finished
gohier
handed
it
to
his
secretary
and
moulins
half
dead
with
exhaustion
returned
to
his
apartments
to
take
some
food
it
was
then
about
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
an
instant
later
gohier
s
secretary
returned
in
great
perturbation
well
said
gohier
why
have
you
not
gone
citizen
president
replied
the
young
man
we
are
prisoners
in
the
prisoners
what
do
you
mean
the
guard
has
been
changed
and
general
jubé
is
no
longer
in
who
has
replaced
him
i
think
some
one
said
general
moreau
impossible
and
that
coward
barras
where
is
he
he
has
started
for
his
at
ah
i
must
see
moulins
cried
gohier
rushing
to
the
door
but
at
the
entrance
he
found
a
sentry
who
barred
the
door
gohier
insisted
no
one
can
pass
said
the
sentry
what
not
pass
but
i
am
president
gohier
no
one
can
pass
said
the
sentry
that
is
the
gohier
saw
it
would
be
useless
to
say
more
force
would
be
impossible
he
returned
to
his
own
rooms
in
the
meantime
general
moreau
had
gone
to
see
moulins
he
wished
to
justify
himself
without
listening
to
a
word
the
turned
his
back
on
him
and
as
moreau
insisted
he
said
general
go
into
the
that
is
the
place
for
moreau
bowed
his
head
and
understood
for
the
first
time
into
what
a
fatal
trap
his
honor
had
fallen
at
five
o
clock
bonaparte
started
to
return
to
the
rue
de
la
victoire
all
the
generals
and
superior
officers
in
paris
accompanied
him
the
blindest
those
who
had
not
understood
the
vendemiaire
those
who
had
not
yet
understood
the
return
from
egypt
now
saw
blazing
over
the
tuileries
the
star
of
his
future
and
as
everybody
could
not
be
a
planet
each
sought
to
become
a
satellite
the
shouts
of
vive
bonaparte
which
came
from
the
lower
part
of
the
rue
du
mont
blanc
and
swept
like
a
sonorous
wave
toward
the
rue
de
la
victoire
told
josephine
of
her
husband
s
return
the
impressionable
creole
had
awaited
him
anxiously
she
sprang
to
meet
him
in
such
agitation
that
she
was
unable
to
utter
a
single
word
come
come
said
bonaparte
becoming
the
kindly
man
he
was
in
his
own
home
calm
yourself
we
have
done
all
that
could
be
is
it
all
over
oh
no
replied
bonaparte
must
it
be
done
all
over
again
yes
but
it
will
be
merely
a
that
formality
was
rather
rough
but
every
one
knows
of
the
events
at
we
will
therefore
dispense
with
relating
them
and
turn
at
once
to
the
result
impatient
as
we
are
to
get
back
to
the
real
subject
of
our
drama
from
which
the
grand
historical
figure
we
have
introduced
diverted
us
for
an
instant
one
word
more
the
brumaire
at
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
bonaparte
was
appointed
first
consul
for
ten
years
he
himself
selected
cambacérès
and
lebrun
as
his
associates
under
the
title
of
second
consuls
being
firmly
resolved
this
time
to
concentrate
in
his
own
person
not
only
all
the
functions
of
the
two
consuls
but
those
of
the
ministers
the
brumaire
he
slept
at
the
luxembourg
in
president
gohier
s
bed
the
latter
having
been
liberated
with
his
colleague
moulins
roland
was
made
governor
of
the
luxembourg
chapter
xxv
an
important
communication
some
time
after
this
military
revolution
which
created
a
great
stir
in
europe
convulsing
the
continent
for
a
time
as
a
tempest
convulses
the
ocean
some
time
after
we
say
on
the
morning
of
the
nivoise
better
and
more
clearly
known
to
our
readers
as
the
of
january
roland
in
looking
over
the
voluminous
correspondence
which
his
new
office
entailed
upon
him
found
among
fifty
other
letters
asking
for
an
audience
the
following
monsieur
the
know
your
loyalty
to
your
word
and
you
will
see
that
i
rely
on
it
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
for
five
minutes
during
which
i
must
remain
masked
i
have
a
request
to
make
to
you
this
request
you
will
grant
or
deny
in
either
case
as
i
shall
have
entered
the
palace
of
the
luxembourg
in
the
interest
the
first
consul
bonaparte
and
the
royalist
party
to
which
i
belong
i
shall
ask
for
your
word
of
honor
that
i
be
allowed
to
leave
it
as
freely
as
you
allow
me
to
enter
if
at
seven
in
the
evening
i
see
a
solitary
light
in
the
window
over
the
clock
i
shall
know
that
colonel
roland
de
montrevel
has
pledged
me
his
word
of
honor
and
i
shall
boldly
present
myself
at
the
little
door
of
the
left
wing
of
the
palace
opening
on
the
garden
i
shall
strike
three
blows
at
intervals
after
the
manner
of
the
in
order
that
you
may
know
to
whom
you
engage
or
refuse
your
word
i
sign
a
name
which
is
known
to
you
that
name
having
been
under
circumstances
you
have
probably
not
forgotten
pronounced
before
you
morgan
chief
of
the
companions
of
jehu
roland
read
the
letter
twice
thought
it
over
for
a
few
moments
then
rose
suddenly
and
entering
the
first
consul
s
study
handed
it
to
him
silently
the
latter
read
it
without
betraying
the
slightest
emotion
or
even
surprise
then
with
a
laconism
that
was
wholly
lacedæmonian
he
said
place
the
then
he
gave
the
letter
back
to
roland
the
next
evening
at
seven
o
clock
the
light
shone
in
the
window
and
at
five
minutes
past
the
hour
roland
in
person
was
waiting
at
the
little
door
of
the
garden
he
had
scarcely
been
there
a
moment
when
three
blows
were
struck
on
the
door
after
the
manner
of
the
first
two
strokes
and
then
one
the
door
was
opened
immediately
a
man
wrapped
in
a
cloak
was
sharply
defined
against
the
grayish
atmosphere
of
the
wintry
night
as
for
roland
he
was
completely
hidden
in
shadow
seeing
no
one
the
man
in
the
cloak
remained
motionless
for
a
second
come
in
said
roland
ah
it
is
you
colonel
how
do
you
know
it
is
i
asked
roland
i
recognize
your
my
voice
but
during
those
few
moments
we
were
together
in
the
at
avignon
i
did
not
say
a
then
i
must
have
heard
it
roland
wondered
where
the
chief
of
the
companions
of
jehu
could
have
heard
his
voice
but
the
other
said
gayly
is
the
fact
that
i
know
your
voice
any
reason
why
we
should
stand
at
the
door
no
indeed
replied
roland
take
the
lapel
of
my
coat
and
follow
me
i
purposely
forbade
any
lights
being
placed
in
the
stairs
and
hall
which
lead
to
my
i
am
much
obliged
for
the
intention
but
on
your
word
i
would
cross
the
palace
from
one
end
to
the
other
though
it
were
lighted
as
the
italians
you
have
my
word
replied
roland
so
follow
me
without
morgan
needed
no
encouragement
he
followed
his
guide
fearlessly
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
roland
turned
down
a
corridor
equally
dark
went
twenty
steps
opened
a
door
and
entered
his
own
room
morgan
followed
him
the
room
was
lighted
by
two
wax
candles
only
once
there
morgan
took
off
his
cloak
and
laid
his
pistols
on
the
table
what
are
you
doing
asked
roland
faith
with
your
permission
replied
morgan
gayly
i
am
making
myself
but
those
pistols
you
have
just
laid
aside
ah
did
you
think
i
brought
them
for
you
for
whom
then
why
that
damned
police
you
can
readily
imagine
that
i
am
not
disposed
to
let
citizen
fouché
lay
hold
of
me
without
burning
the
mustache
of
the
first
of
his
minions
who
lays
hands
on
but
once
here
you
feel
you
have
nothing
to
fear
the
deuce
exclaimed
the
young
man
i
have
your
then
why
don
t
you
unmask
because
my
face
only
half
belongs
to
me
the
other
half
belongs
to
my
companions
who
knows
if
one
of
us
being
recognized
might
not
drag
the
others
to
the
guillotine
for
of
course
you
know
colonel
we
don
t
hide
from
ourselves
that
that
is
the
price
of
our
game
then
why
risk
it
ah
what
a
question
why
do
you
venture
on
the
field
of
battle
where
a
bullet
may
plow
through
your
breast
or
a
lop
off
your
head
permit
me
to
say
that
that
is
different
on
the
battlefield
i
risk
an
honorable
ah
do
you
suppose
that
on
the
day
i
get
my
head
cut
off
by
the
revolutionary
triangle
i
shall
think
myself
dishonored
not
the
least
in
the
world
i
am
a
soldier
like
you
only
we
can
t
all
serve
our
cause
in
the
same
way
every
religion
has
its
heroes
and
its
martyrs
happy
the
heroes
in
this
world
and
happy
the
martyrs
in
the
the
young
man
uttered
these
words
with
a
conviction
which
moved
or
rather
astonished
roland
but
continued
morgan
abandoning
his
enthusiasm
to
revert
to
the
gayety
which
seemed
the
distinctive
trait
of
his
character
i
did
not
come
here
to
talk
political
philosophy
i
came
to
ask
you
to
let
me
speak
to
the
first
what
speak
to
the
first
consul
exclaimed
roland
of
course
read
my
letter
over
did
i
not
tell
you
that
i
had
a
request
to
make
well
that
request
is
to
let
me
speak
to
general
but
permit
me
to
say
that
as
i
did
not
expect
that
request
it
surprises
you
makes
you
uneasy
even
my
dear
colonel
if
you
don
t
believe
my
word
you
can
search
me
from
head
to
foot
and
you
will
find
that
those
pistols
are
my
only
weapons
and
i
haven
t
even
got
them
since
there
they
are
on
your
table
better
still
take
one
in
each
hand
post
yourself
between
the
first
consul
and
me
and
blowout
my
brains
at
the
first
suspicious
move
i
make
will
that
suit
you
but
will
you
assure
me
if
i
disturb
the
first
consul
and
ask
him
to
see
you
that
your
communication
is
worth
the
trouble
oh
i
ll
answer
for
that
said
morgan
then
in
his
joyous
tones
he
added
i
am
for
the
moment
the
ambassador
of
a
crowned
or
rather
discrowned
head
which
makes
it
no
less
reverenced
by
noble
hearts
moreover
monsieur
roland
i
shall
take
up
very
little
of
your
general
s
time
the
moment
the
conversation
seems
too
long
he
can
dismiss
me
and
i
assure
you
he
will
not
have
to
say
the
word
roland
was
silent
and
thoughtful
for
a
moment
and
it
is
to
the
first
consul
only
that
you
can
make
this
communication
to
the
first
consul
only
as
he
alone
can
answer
very
well
wait
until
i
take
his
roland
made
a
step
toward
the
general
s
room
then
he
paused
and
cast
an
uneasy
look
at
a
mass
of
papers
piled
on
his
table
morgan
intercepted
this
look
what
he
said
you
are
afraid
i
shall
read
those
papers
in
your
absence
if
you
only
knew
how
i
detest
reading
if
my
lay
on
that
table
i
wouldn
t
take
the
trouble
to
read
it
i
should
consider
that
the
clerk
s
business
and
every
one
to
his
own
task
monsieur
roland
my
feet
are
cold
and
i
will
sit
here
in
your
and
warm
them
i
shall
not
stir
till
you
very
good
monsieur
said
roland
and
he
went
to
the
first
consul
bonaparte
was
talking
with
general
hedouville
commanding
the
troops
of
the
vendée
hearing
the
door
open
he
turned
impatiently
i
told
bourrienne
i
would
not
see
any
so
he
told
me
as
i
came
in
but
i
told
him
that
i
was
not
any
true
what
do
you
want
be
he
is
in
my
who
the
man
of
ah
ha
and
what
does
he
want
to
see
to
see
me
yes
you
general
does
that
surprise
you
no
but
what
can
he
want
to
say
to
me
he
refused
obstinately
to
tell
me
but
i
dare
answer
for
it
that
he
is
neither
importunate
nor
a
no
but
he
may
be
an
roland
shook
his
head
of
course
since
you
introduce
him
moreover
he
is
willing
that
i
should
be
present
at
the
conference
and
stand
between
you
and
bonaparte
reflected
an
instant
bring
him
in
he
said
you
know
general
that
except
me
yes
general
hedouville
will
be
so
kind
as
to
wait
a
second
our
conversation
is
of
a
nature
that
is
not
exhausted
in
one
interview
go
roland
left
the
room
crossed
bourrienne
s
office
reentered
his
own
room
and
found
morgan
as
he
had
said
warming
his
feet
come
the
first
consul
is
waiting
for
you
said
the
young
man
morgan
rose
and
followed
roland
when
they
entered
bonaparte
s
study
the
latter
was
alone
he
cast
a
rapid
glance
on
the
chief
of
the
companions
of
jehu
and
felt
no
doubt
that
he
was
the
same
man
he
had
seen
at
avignon
morgan
had
paused
a
few
steps
from
the
door
and
was
looking
curiously
at
bonaparte
convincing
himself
that
he
was
the
man
he
had
seen
at
the
table
d
hôte
the
day
he
attempted
the
perilous
restoration
of
the
two
hundred
louis
stolen
by
an
oversight
from
jean
picot
come
nearer
said
the
first
consul
morgan
bowed
and
made
three
steps
forward
bonaparte
partly
returned
the
bow
with
a
slight
motion
of
the
head
you
told
my
colonel
roland
that
you
had
a
communication
to
make
yes
citizen
first
does
that
communication
require
a
private
interview
no
citizen
first
consul
although
it
is
of
such
importance
you
would
prefer
to
be
beyond
doubt
but
prudence
the
most
prudent
thing
in
france
citizen
morgan
is
my
presence
here
general
proves
that
i
agree
with
you
bonaparte
turned
to
the
young
colonel
leave
us
alone
roland
said
he
but
general
objected
roland
bonaparte
went
up
to
him
and
said
in
a
low
voice
i
see
what
it
is
you
are
curious
to
know
what
this
mysterious
cavalier
of
the
highroad
has
to
say
to
me
don
t
worry
you
shall
that
s
not
it
but
suppose
as
you
said
just
now
he
is
an
didn
t
you
declare
he
was
not
come
don
t
be
a
baby
leave
roland
went
out
now
that
we
are
alone
sir
said
the
first
consul
speak
morgan
without
answering
drew
a
letter
from
his
pocket
and
gave
it
to
the
general
bonaparte
examined
it
it
was
addressed
to
him
and
the
seal
bore
the
three
of
france
oh
he
said
what
is
this
sir
read
it
citizen
first
bonaparte
opened
the
letter
and
looked
at
the
signature
louis
he
said
louis
repeated
morgan
what
louis
louis
de
bourbon
i
monsieur
le
comte
de
provençe
brother
of
louis
consequently
louis
since
his
nephew
the
dauphin
is
bonaparte
looked
at
the
stranger
again
it
was
evident
that
morgan
was
a
pseudonym
assumed
to
hide
his
real
name
then
turning
his
eyes
on
the
letter
he
read
january
whatever
may
be
their
apparent
conduct
monsieur
men
like
you
never
inspire
distrust
you
have
accepted
an
exalted
post
and
i
thank
you
for
so
doing
you
know
better
than
others
that
force
and
power
are
needed
to
make
the
happiness
of
a
great
nation
save
france
from
her
own
madness
and
you
will
fulfil
the
desire
of
my
heart
restore
her
king
and
future
generations
will
bless
your
memory
if
you
doubt
my
gratitude
choose
your
own
place
determine
the
future
of
your
friends
as
for
my
principles
i
am
a
frenchman
clement
by
nature
still
more
so
by
judgment
no
the
conqueror
of
lodi
castiglione
and
arcola
the
conqueror
of
italy
and
egypt
can
not
prefer
an
empty
celebrity
to
fame
lose
no
more
precious
time
we
can
secure
the
glory
of
france
i
say
we
because
i
have
need
of
bonaparte
for
that
which
he
can
not
achieve
without
me
general
the
eyes
of
europe
are
upon
you
glory
awaits
you
and
i
am
eager
to
restore
my
people
to
happiness
louis
bonaparte
turned
to
the
young
man
who
stood
erect
motionless
and
silent
as
a
statue
do
you
know
the
contents
of
this
letter
he
asked
the
young
man
bowed
yes
citizen
first
it
was
sealed
it
was
sent
unsealed
under
cover
to
the
person
who
intrusted
it
to
me
and
before
doing
so
he
made
me
read
it
that
i
might
know
its
full
can
i
know
the
name
of
the
person
who
intrusted
it
to
you
georges
bonaparte
started
slightly
do
you
know
georges
cadoudal
he
asked
he
is
my
why
did
he
intrust
it
to
you
rather
than
to
another
because
he
knew
that
in
telling
me
to
deliver
the
letter
to
you
with
my
own
hand
it
would
be
you
have
certainly
kept
your
promise
not
altogether
yet
citizen
first
how
do
you
mean
haven
t
you
delivered
it
to
me
yes
but
i
promised
to
bring
back
an
but
if
i
tell
you
i
will
not
give
you
will
have
answered
not
precisely
as
i
could
have
wished
but
it
will
be
an
bonaparte
reflected
for
a
few
moments
then
shaking
his
shoulders
to
rid
himself
of
his
thoughts
he
said
they
are
who
citizen
asked
morgan
those
who
write
me
such
letters
fools
arch
fools
do
they
take
me
for
a
man
who
patterns
his
conduct
by
the
past
play
monk
what
good
would
it
do
bring
back
another
charles
no
faith
it
is
not
worth
while
when
a
man
has
toulon
the
vendemiaire
lodi
castiglione
arcola
rivoli
and
the
pyramids
behind
him
he
s
no
monk
he
has
the
right
to
aspire
to
more
than
a
duchy
of
albemarle
and
the
command
by
land
and
sea
of
the
forces
of
his
majesty
king
louis
for
that
reason
you
are
asked
to
make
your
own
conditions
citizen
first
bonaparte
started
at
the
sound
of
that
voice
as
if
he
had
forgotten
that
any
one
was
present
not
counting
he
went
on
that
it
is
a
ruined
family
a
dead
branch
of
a
rotten
trunk
the
bourbons
have
so
intermarried
with
one
another
that
the
race
is
depraved
louis
xiv
exhausted
all
its
sap
all
its
you
know
history
sir
asked
bonaparte
turning
to
the
young
man
yes
general
he
replied
at
least
as
well
as
a
can
know
well
you
must
have
observed
in
history
especially
in
that
of
france
that
each
race
has
its
point
of
departure
its
culmination
and
its
decadence
look
at
the
direct
line
of
the
capets
starting
from
hugues
capet
they
attained
their
highest
grandeur
in
philippe
auguste
and
louis
and
fell
with
philippe
and
charles
iv
take
the
valois
starting
with
philippe
they
culminated
in
françois
and
fell
with
charles
ix
and
henry
iii
see
the
bourbons
starting
with
henry
they
have
their
culminating
point
in
louis
xiv
and
fall
with
louis
xv
and
louis
only
they
fall
lower
than
the
others
lower
in
debauchery
with
louis
lower
in
misfortune
with
louis
xvi
you
talk
to
me
of
the
stuarts
and
show
me
the
example
of
monk
will
you
tell
me
who
succeeded
charles
james
ii
and
who
to
james
william
of
orange
a
usurper
would
it
not
have
been
better
i
ask
you
if
monk
had
put
the
crown
on
his
own
head
well
if
i
was
fool
enough
to
restore
louis
xviii
to
the
throne
like
charles
ii
he
would
have
no
children
and
like
james
his
brother
charles
would
succeed
him
and
like
him
would
be
driven
out
by
some
william
of
orange
no
no
god
has
not
put
the
destiny
of
this
great
and
glorious
country
we
call
france
into
my
hands
that
i
should
cast
it
back
to
those
who
have
gambled
with
it
and
lost
permit
me
general
to
remark
that
i
did
not
ask
you
for
all
but
i
i
ask
you
i
think
you
are
doing
me
the
honor
to
take
me
for
bonaparte
started
turned
round
saw
to
whom
he
was
speaking
and
was
silent
i
only
want
said
morgan
with
a
dignity
which
surprised
the
man
whom
he
addressed
a
yes
or
a
and
why
do
you
want
that
to
know
whether
we
must
continue
to
war
against
you
as
an
enemy
or
fall
at
your
feet
as
a
war
said
bonaparte
war
madmen
they
who
war
with
me
do
they
not
see
that
i
am
the
elect
of
god
attila
said
the
same
yes
but
he
was
the
elect
of
destruction
i
of
the
new
era
the
grass
withered
where
he
stepped
the
harvest
will
ripen
where
i
pass
the
plow
war
tell
me
what
has
become
of
those
who
have
made
it
against
me
they
lie
upon
the
plains
of
piedmont
of
lombardy
and
cairo
you
forget
the
vendée
the
vendée
is
still
afoot
yes
but
her
leaders
cathelineau
lescure
la
rochejaquelin
d
elbée
bonchamps
stoffiet
charette
you
are
speaking
of
men
only
the
men
have
been
mown
down
it
is
true
but
the
principle
is
still
afoot
and
for
it
are
fighting
autichamp
suzannet
grignon
frotté
châtillon
cadoudal
the
younger
may
not
be
worth
the
elder
but
if
they
die
as
their
elders
died
what
more
can
you
ask
let
them
beware
if
i
determine
upon
a
campaign
against
the
vendée
i
shall
send
neither
santerre
nor
rossignol
the
convention
sent
kléber
and
the
directory
hoche
i
shall
not
send
i
shall
go
nothing
worse
can
happen
to
them
than
to
be
killed
like
lescure
or
shot
like
it
may
happen
that
i
pardon
cato
taught
us
how
to
escape
the
pardon
of
take
care
you
are
quoting
a
republican
cato
was
one
of
those
men
whose
example
can
be
followed
no
matter
to
what
party
they
and
suppose
i
were
to
tell
you
that
i
hold
the
vendée
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand
you
and
that
within
three
months
she
will
lay
down
her
arms
if
i
choose
the
young
man
shook
his
head
you
don
t
believe
me
i
hesitate
to
believe
if
i
affirm
to
you
that
what
i
say
is
true
if
i
prove
it
by
telling
you
the
means
or
rather
the
men
by
whom
i
shall
bring
this
about
if
a
man
like
general
bonaparte
affirms
a
thing
i
shall
believe
it
and
if
that
thing
is
the
pacification
of
the
vendée
i
shall
say
in
my
turn
beware
better
the
vendée
fighting
than
the
vendée
conspiring
the
vendée
fighting
means
the
sword
the
vendée
conspiring
means
the
oh
i
know
your
dagger
said
bonaparte
here
it
and
he
drew
from
a
drawer
the
dagger
he
had
taken
from
roland
and
laid
it
on
the
table
within
reach
of
morgan
s
hand
but
he
added
there
is
some
distance
between
bonaparte
s
breast
and
an
assassin
s
dagger
and
he
advanced
to
the
young
man
with
a
flaming
eye
i
did
not
come
here
to
assassinate
you
said
the
young
man
coldly
later
if
i
consider
your
death
indispensable
to
the
cause
i
shall
do
all
in
my
power
and
if
i
fail
it
will
not
be
because
you
are
marius
and
i
the
cimbrian
have
you
anything
else
to
say
to
me
citizen
first
consul
concluded
the
young
man
bowing
yes
tell
cadoudal
that
when
he
is
ready
to
fight
the
enemy
instead
of
frenchmen
i
have
a
colonel
s
commission
ready
signed
in
my
desk
for
cadoudal
commands
not
a
regiment
but
an
army
you
were
unwilling
to
retrograde
from
bonaparte
to
monk
why
should
you
expect
him
to
descend
from
general
to
colonel
have
you
nothing
else
to
say
to
me
citizen
first
consul
yes
have
you
any
way
of
transmitting
my
reply
to
the
comte
de
provençe
you
mean
king
louis
xviii
don
t
let
us
quibble
over
words
to
him
who
wrote
to
his
envoy
is
now
at
the
camp
at
well
i
have
changed
my
mind
i
shall
send
him
an
answer
these
bourbons
are
so
blind
that
this
one
would
misinterpret
my
and
bonaparte
sitting
down
at
his
desk
wrote
the
following
letter
with
a
care
that
showed
he
wished
to
make
it
legible
i
have
received
your
letter
monsieur
i
thank
you
for
the
good
opinion
you
express
in
it
of
me
you
must
not
wish
for
your
return
to
france
it
could
only
be
over
a
hundred
thousand
dead
bodies
sacrifice
your
own
interests
to
the
repose
and
welfare
of
france
history
will
applaud
you
i
am
not
insensible
to
the
misfortunes
of
your
family
and
i
shall
hear
with
pleasure
that
you
are
surrounded
with
all
that
could
contribute
to
the
tranquillity
of
your
retreat
bonaparte
then
folding
and
sealing
the
letter
he
directed
it
to
monsieur
le
comte
de
provençe
and
handed
it
to
morgan
then
he
called
roland
as
if
he
knew
the
latter
were
not
far
off
general
said
the
young
officer
appearing
instantly
conduct
this
gentleman
to
the
street
said
bonaparte
until
then
you
are
responsible
for
roland
bowed
in
sign
of
obedience
let
the
young
man
who
said
not
a
word
pass
before
him
and
then
followed
but
before
leaving
morgan
cast
a
last
glance
at
bonaparte
the
latter
was
still
standing
motionless
and
silent
with
folded
arms
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
dagger
which
occupied
his
thoughts
far
more
than
he
was
willing
to
admit
even
to
himself
as
they
crossed
roland
s
room
the
chief
of
the
companions
of
jehu
gathered
up
his
cloak
and
pistols
while
he
was
putting
them
in
his
belt
roland
remarked
the
citizen
first
consul
seems
to
have
shown
you
a
dagger
which
i
gave
yes
monsieur
replied
morgan
did
you
recognize
it
not
that
one
in
particular
all
our
daggers
are
well
said
roland
i
will
tell
you
whence
it
ah
where
was
that
from
the
breast
of
a
friend
of
mine
where
your
companions
possibly
you
yourself
thrust
possibly
replied
the
young
man
carelessly
but
your
friend
must
have
exposed
himself
to
my
friend
wished
to
see
what
was
happening
at
night
in
the
he
did
but
i
did
the
same
wrong
the
night
before
and
nothing
happened
to
probably
because
some
talisman
protects
monsieur
let
me
tell
you
something
i
am
a
man
who
walks
by
daylight
i
have
a
horror
of
all
that
is
happy
those
who
can
walk
the
highroads
by
daylight
monsieur
de
montrevel
that
is
why
i
am
going
to
tell
you
the
oath
i
made
monsieur
morgan
as
i
drew
the
dagger
you
saw
from
my
friend
s
breast
as
carefully
as
possible
that
i
might
not
draw
his
soul
with
it
i
swore
that
henceforward
it
should
be
war
to
the
death
between
his
assassins
and
myself
it
was
largely
to
tell
you
that
that
i
gave
you
a
pledge
of
that
is
an
oath
i
hope
to
see
you
forget
monsieur
de
it
is
an
oath
i
shall
keep
under
all
circumstances
monsieur
morgan
and
you
would
be
most
kind
if
you
would
furnish
me
with
an
opportunity
as
soon
as
in
what
way
sir
well
for
example
by
accepting
a
meeting
with
me
either
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
or
at
vincennes
we
don
t
need
to
say
that
we
are
fighting
because
you
or
one
of
your
friends
stabbed
lord
tanlay
no
we
can
say
anything
you
roland
reflected
a
moment
we
can
say
the
duel
is
on
account
of
the
eclipse
that
takes
place
on
the
of
next
month
does
the
pretext
suit
you
the
pretext
would
suit
me
replied
morgan
in
a
tone
of
sadness
of
which
he
seemed
incapable
if
the
duel
itself
could
take
place
you
have
taken
an
oath
and
you
mean
to
keep
it
you
say
well
every
initiate
who
enters
the
company
of
jehu
swears
that
he
will
not
expose
in
any
personal
quarrel
a
life
that
belongs
to
the
cause
and
not
to
oh
so
that
you
assassinate
but
will
not
you
are
mistaken
we
sometimes
have
the
goodness
to
point
out
an
occasion
when
i
may
study
that
easily
enough
if
you
and
five
or
six
men
as
resolute
as
yourself
will
take
your
places
in
some
diligence
carrying
government
money
and
will
defend
it
against
our
attack
the
occasion
you
seek
will
come
but
believe
me
do
better
than
that
do
not
come
in
our
is
that
a
threat
sir
asked
the
young
man
raising
his
head
no
replied
morgan
in
a
gentle
almost
supplicating
voice
it
is
an
is
it
addressed
to
me
in
particular
or
would
you
include
others
i
make
it
to
you
in
particular
and
the
chief
of
the
companions
of
jehu
dwelt
upon
the
last
word
ah
exclaimed
the
young
man
then
i
am
so
fortunate
as
to
interest
you
as
a
brother
replied
morgan
in
the
same
soft
caressing
tone
well
well
said
roland
this
is
decidedly
a
bourrienne
entered
at
that
moment
roland
he
said
the
first
consul
wants
give
me
time
to
conduct
this
gentleman
to
the
street
and
i
ll
be
with
hurry
up
you
know
he
doesn
t
like
to
will
you
follow
me
sir
roland
said
to
his
mysterious
companion
i
am
at
your
orders
come
then
and
roland
taking
the
same
path
by
which
he
had
brought
morgan
took
him
back
not
to
the
door
opening
on
the
garden
the
garden
was
closed
but
to
that
on
the
street
once
there
he
stopped
and
said
sir
i
gave
you
my
word
and
i
have
kept
it
faithfully
but
that
there
may
be
no
misunderstanding
between
us
have
the
goodness
to
tell
me
that
you
understand
it
to
have
been
for
this
one
time
and
for
that
was
how
i
understood
it
you
give
me
back
my
word
then
i
should
like
to
keep
it
sir
but
i
recognize
that
you
are
free
to
take
it
that
is
all
i
wish
to
know
au
revoir
monsieur
permit
me
not
to
offer
you
the
same
wish
monsieur
de
the
two
young
men
bowed
with
perfect
courtesy
roland
the
luxembourg
and
morgan
following
the
line
of
shadow
projected
by
the
walls
took
one
of
the
little
streets
to
the
place
it
is
he
whom
we
are
now
to
follow
chapter
xxvi
the
ball
of
the
victims
after
taking
about
a
hundred
steps
morgan
removed
his
mask
he
ran
more
risk
of
being
noticed
in
the
streets
of
paris
as
a
masked
man
than
with
uncovered
face
when
he
reached
the
rue
taranne
he
knocked
at
the
door
of
a
small
furnished
at
the
corner
of
that
street
and
the
rue
du
dragon
took
a
candlestick
from
a
table
a
key
numbered
from
a
nail
and
climbed
the
stairs
without
exciting
other
attention
than
a
lodger
would
returning
home
the
clock
was
striking
ten
as
he
closed
the
door
of
his
room
he
listened
attentively
to
the
strokes
the
light
of
his
candle
not
reaching
as
far
as
the
he
counted
ten
good
he
said
to
himself
i
shall
not
be
too
in
spite
of
this
probability
morgan
seemed
determined
to
lose
no
time
he
passed
a
bit
of
under
the
heater
on
the
hearth
which
caught
fire
instantly
he
lighted
four
all
there
were
in
the
room
placed
two
on
the
and
two
on
a
bureau
opposite
and
spread
upon
the
bed
a
complete
dress
of
the
incroyable
of
the
very
latest
fashion
it
consisted
of
a
short
coat
cut
square
across
the
front
and
long
behind
of
a
soft
shade
between
a
and
a
a
waistcoat
of
buff
plush
with
eighteen
buttons
an
immense
white
cravat
of
the
finest
cambric
light
trousers
of
white
cashmere
decorated
with
a
knot
of
ribbon
where
they
buttoned
above
the
calves
and
silk
stockings
striped
transversely
with
the
same
green
as
the
coat
and
delicate
pumps
with
diamond
buckles
the
inevitable
was
not
forgotten
as
for
the
hat
it
was
precisely
the
same
in
which
carle
vernet
painted
his
dandy
of
the
directory
when
these
things
were
ready
morgan
waited
with
seeming
impatience
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
he
rang
the
bell
a
waiter
appeared
hasn
t
the
come
asked
morgan
in
those
days
were
not
yet
called
yes
citizen
replied
the
waiter
he
came
but
you
had
not
yet
returned
so
he
left
word
that
he
d
come
back
some
one
knocked
just
as
you
rang
it
s
probably
here
here
cried
a
voice
on
the
stairs
ah
bravo
exclaimed
morgan
come
in
master
cadenette
you
must
make
a
sort
of
adonis
of
that
won
t
be
difficult
monsieur
le
baron
replied
the
look
here
look
here
do
you
mean
to
compromise
me
citizen
cadenette
monsieur
le
baron
i
entreat
you
call
me
cadenette
you
ll
honor
me
by
that
proof
of
familiarity
but
don
t
call
me
citizen
fie
that
s
a
revolutionary
denomination
even
in
the
worst
of
the
terror
i
always
called
my
wife
madame
cadenette
now
excuse
me
for
not
waiting
for
you
but
there
s
a
great
ball
in
the
rue
du
bac
this
evening
the
ball
of
the
victims
the
emphasized
this
word
i
should
have
thought
that
le
baron
would
be
why
cried
morgan
laughing
so
you
are
still
a
royalist
cadenette
the
laid
his
hand
tragically
on
his
heart
monsieur
le
baron
said
he
it
is
not
only
a
matter
of
conscience
but
a
matter
of
conscience
i
can
understand
that
master
cadenette
but
state
what
the
devil
has
the
honorable
guild
of
wigmakers
to
do
with
politics
what
monsieur
le
baron
said
cadenette
all
the
while
getting
ready
to
dress
his
client
s
hair
you
ask
me
that
you
an
aristocrat
hush
cadenette
monsieur
le
baron
we
can
say
that
to
each
so
you
are
a
to
the
core
in
what
style
shall
i
dress
le
baron
s
hair
dog
s
ears
and
tied
up
with
a
dash
of
powder
two
if
you
like
ah
monsieur
when
one
thinks
that
for
five
years
i
was
the
only
man
who
had
an
atom
of
powder
la
why
monsieur
le
baron
a
man
was
guillotined
for
owning
a
box
of
powder
i
ve
known
people
who
were
guillotined
for
less
than
that
cadenette
but
explain
how
you
happen
to
be
a
i
like
to
understand
it
s
very
simple
monsieur
le
baron
you
admit
don
t
you
that
among
the
guilds
there
were
some
that
were
more
or
less
beyond
doubt
accordingly
as
they
were
nearer
to
the
higher
classes
of
that
s
it
monsieur
le
baron
well
we
had
the
higher
classes
by
the
hair
of
their
head
i
such
as
you
see
me
i
have
dressed
madame
de
polignac
s
hair
my
father
dressed
madame
du
barry
s
my
grandfather
madame
de
pompadour
s
we
had
our
privileges
monsieur
we
carried
swords
it
is
true
to
avoid
the
accidents
that
were
liable
to
crop
up
among
hotheads
like
ourselves
our
swords
were
usually
of
wood
but
at
any
rate
if
they
were
not
the
actual
thing
they
were
very
good
imitations
yes
monsieur
le
baron
continued
cadenette
with
a
sigh
those
days
were
the
good
days
not
only
for
the
but
for
all
france
we
were
in
all
the
secrets
all
the
intrigues
nothing
was
hidden
from
us
and
there
is
no
known
instance
monsieur
le
baron
of
a
betraying
a
secret
just
look
at
our
poor
queen
to
whom
did
she
trust
her
diamonds
to
the
great
the
illustrious
leonard
the
prince
of
well
monsieur
le
baron
two
men
alone
overthrew
the
scaffolding
of
a
power
that
rested
on
the
wigs
of
louis
the
puffs
of
the
regency
the
frizettes
of
and
the
cushions
of
marie
and
those
two
men
those
levellers
those
two
revolutionaries
who
were
they
cadenette
that
i
may
doom
them
so
far
as
it
lies
in
my
power
to
public
m
rousseau
and
citizen
talma
monsieur
rousseau
who
said
that
absurdity
we
must
return
to
nature
and
citizen
talma
who
invented
the
titus
that
s
true
cadenette
that
s
when
the
directory
came
in
there
was
a
moment
s
hope
barras
never
gave
up
powder
and
citizen
moulins
stuck
to
his
queue
but
you
see
the
brumaire
has
knocked
it
all
down
how
could
any
one
friz
bonaparte
s
hair
ah
there
continued
cadenette
puffing
out
the
dog
s
ears
of
his
client
there
s
aristocratic
hair
for
you
soft
and
fine
as
silk
and
takes
the
tongs
so
well
one
would
think
you
wore
a
wig
see
monsieur
le
baron
you
wanted
to
be
as
handsome
as
adonis
ah
if
venus
had
seen
you
it
s
not
of
adonis
that
mars
would
have
been
jealous
and
cadenette
now
at
the
end
of
his
labors
and
satisfied
with
the
result
presented
a
to
morgan
who
examined
himself
complacently
come
come
he
said
to
the
you
are
certainly
an
artist
my
dear
fellow
remember
this
style
for
if
ever
they
cut
off
my
head
i
shall
choose
to
have
it
dressed
like
that
for
there
will
probably
be
women
at
my
and
le
baron
wants
them
to
regret
him
said
the
gravely
yes
and
in
the
meantime
my
dear
cadenette
here
is
a
crown
to
reward
your
labors
have
the
goodness
to
tell
them
below
to
call
a
carriage
for
cadenette
sighed
monsieur
le
baron
said
he
time
was
when
i
should
have
answered
show
yourself
at
court
with
your
hair
dressed
like
that
and
i
shall
be
but
there
is
no
court
now
monsieur
le
baron
and
one
must
live
you
shall
have
your
with
which
cadenette
sighed
again
slipped
morgan
s
crown
in
his
pocket
made
the
reverential
bow
of
and
and
left
the
young
man
to
complete
his
toilet
the
head
being
now
dressed
the
rest
was
soon
done
the
cravat
alone
took
time
owing
to
the
many
failures
that
occurred
but
morgan
concluded
the
difficult
task
with
an
experienced
hand
and
as
eleven
o
clock
was
striking
he
was
ready
to
start
cadenette
had
not
forgotten
his
errand
a
was
at
the
door
morgan
jumped
into
it
calling
out
rue
du
bac
no
the
coach
turned
into
the
rue
de
grenelle
went
up
the
rue
du
bac
and
stopped
at
no
here
s
a
double
fare
friend
said
morgan
on
condition
that
you
don
t
stand
before
the
the
driver
took
the
three
francs
and
disappeared
around
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
varennes
morgan
glanced
up
the
front
of
the
house
it
seemed
as
though
he
must
be
mistaken
so
dark
and
silent
was
it
but
he
did
not
hesitate
he
rapped
in
a
peculiar
fashion
the
door
opened
at
the
further
end
of
the
courtyard
was
a
building
brilliantly
lighted
the
young
man
went
toward
it
and
as
he
approached
the
sound
of
instruments
met
his
ear
he
ascended
a
flight
of
stairs
and
entered
the
there
he
gave
his
cloak
to
the
usher
whose
business
it
was
to
attend
to
the
wraps
here
is
your
number
said
the
usher
as
for
your
weapons
you
are
to
place
them
in
the
gallery
where
you
can
find
them
morgan
put
the
number
in
his
trousers
pocket
and
entered
the
great
gallery
transformed
into
an
arsenal
it
contained
a
complete
collection
of
arms
of
all
kinds
pistols
muskets
carbines
swords
and
daggers
as
the
ball
might
at
any
moment
be
invaded
by
the
police
it
was
necessary
that
every
dancer
be
prepared
to
turn
defender
at
an
instant
s
notice
laying
his
weapons
aside
morgan
entered
the
ballroom
we
doubt
if
any
pen
could
give
the
reader
an
adequate
idea
of
the
scene
of
that
ball
generally
as
the
name
ball
of
the
victims
indicated
no
one
was
admitted
except
by
the
strange
right
of
having
relatives
who
had
either
been
sent
to
the
scaffold
by
the
convention
or
the
commune
of
paris
blown
to
pieces
by
collot
d
herbois
or
drowned
by
carrier
as
however
the
victims
guillotined
during
the
three
years
of
the
terror
far
outnumbered
the
others
the
dresses
of
the
majority
of
those
who
were
present
were
the
clothes
of
the
victims
of
the
scaffold
thus
most
of
the
young
girls
whose
mothers
and
older
sisters
had
fallen
by
the
hands
of
the
executioner
wore
the
same
costume
their
mothers
and
sisters
had
worn
for
that
last
lugubrious
ceremony
that
is
to
say
a
white
gown
and
red
shawl
with
their
hair
cut
short
at
the
nape
of
the
neck
some
added
to
this
costume
already
so
characteristic
a
detail
that
was
even
more
significant
they
knotted
around
their
necks
a
thread
of
scarlet
silk
fine
as
the
blade
of
a
razor
which
as
in
faust
s
marguerite
at
the
witches
sabbath
indicated
the
cut
of
the
knife
between
the
throat
and
the
collar
bone
as
for
the
men
who
were
in
the
same
case
they
wore
the
collars
of
their
coats
turned
down
behind
those
of
their
shirt
wide
open
their
necks
bare
and
their
hair
cut
short
but
many
had
other
rights
of
entrance
to
this
ball
besides
that
of
having
victims
in
their
families
some
had
made
victims
themselves
these
latter
were
increasing
there
were
present
men
of
forty
or
years
of
age
who
had
been
trained
in
the
boudoirs
of
the
beautiful
courtesans
of
the
seventeenth
century
who
had
known
madame
du
barry
in
the
attics
of
versailles
sophie
arnoult
with
de
lauraguais
la
duthé
with
the
comte
d
artois
who
had
borrowed
from
the
courtesies
of
vice
the
polish
with
which
they
covered
their
ferocity
they
were
still
young
and
handsome
they
entered
a
salon
tossing
their
perfumed
locks
and
their
scented
handkerchiefs
nor
was
it
a
useless
precaution
for
if
the
odor
of
musk
or
verbena
had
not
masked
it
they
would
have
smelled
of
blood
there
were
men
there
or
thirty
years
old
dressed
with
extreme
elegance
members
of
the
association
of
avengers
who
seemed
possessed
with
the
mania
of
assassination
the
lust
of
slaughter
the
frenzy
of
blood
which
no
blood
could
quench
men
who
when
the
order
came
to
kill
killed
all
friends
or
enemies
men
who
carried
their
business
methods
into
the
business
of
murder
giving
their
bloody
checks
for
the
heads
of
such
or
such
jacobins
and
paying
on
sight
there
were
younger
men
eighteen
and
twenty
almost
children
but
children
fed
like
achilles
on
the
marrow
of
wild
beasts
like
pyrrhus
on
the
flesh
of
bears
here
were
the
of
schiller
the
of
the
that
strange
generation
that
follows
great
political
convulsions
like
the
titans
after
chaos
the
hydras
after
the
deluge
as
the
vultures
and
crows
follow
the
carnage
here
was
the
spectre
of
iron
impassible
implacable
inflexible
which
men
call
retaliation
and
this
spectre
mingled
with
the
guests
it
entered
the
gilded
salons
it
signalled
with
a
look
a
gesture
a
nod
and
men
followed
where
it
led
it
was
as
says
the
author
from
whom
we
have
borrowed
these
hitherto
unknown
but
authentic
details
a
merry
lust
for
the
terror
had
affected
great
cynicism
in
clothes
a
spartan
austerity
in
its
food
the
profound
contempt
of
a
barbarous
people
for
arts
and
enjoyments
the
thermidorian
reaction
was
on
the
contrary
elegant
opulent
adorned
it
exhausted
all
luxuries
all
voluptuous
pleasures
as
in
the
days
of
louis
xv
with
one
addition
the
luxury
of
vengeance
the
lust
of
blood
fréron
s
name
was
given
to
the
youth
of
the
day
which
was
called
the
jeunesse
fréron
or
the
gilded
youth
why
fréron
why
should
he
rather
than
others
receive
that
strange
and
fatal
honor
i
can
not
tell
you
my
researches
those
who
know
me
will
do
me
the
justice
to
admit
that
when
i
have
an
end
in
view
i
do
not
count
them
my
researches
have
not
discovered
an
answer
it
was
a
whim
of
fashion
and
fashion
is
the
one
goddess
more
capricious
than
fortune
our
readers
will
hardly
know
who
fréron
was
the
fréron
who
was
voltaire
s
assailant
was
better
known
than
he
who
was
the
patron
of
these
elegant
assassins
one
was
the
son
of
the
other
louis
stanislas
was
son
of
the
father
died
of
rage
when
miromesnil
keeper
of
the
seals
suppressed
his
journal
the
other
irritated
by
the
injustices
of
which
his
father
had
been
the
victim
had
at
first
ardently
embraced
the
revolutionary
doctrines
instead
of
the
année
littéraire
strangled
to
death
in
he
created
the
orateur
du
peuple
in
he
was
sent
to
the
midi
on
a
special
mission
and
marseilles
and
toulon
retain
to
this
day
the
memory
of
his
cruelty
but
all
was
forgotten
when
on
the
thermidor
he
proclaimed
himself
against
robespierre
and
assisted
in
casting
from
the
altar
the
supreme
being
the
colossus
who
being
an
apostle
had
made
himself
a
god
fréron
repudiated
by
the
mountain
which
abandoned
him
to
the
heavy
jaws
of
moise
bayle
fréron
disdainfully
repulsed
by
the
girondins
who
delivered
him
over
to
the
imprecations
of
isnard
fréron
as
the
terrible
and
picturesque
orator
of
the
var
said
fréron
naked
and
covered
with
the
leprosy
of
crime
was
accepted
caressed
and
petted
by
the
thermidorians
from
them
he
passed
into
the
camp
of
the
royalists
and
without
any
reason
whatever
for
obtaining
that
fatal
honor
found
himself
suddenly
at
the
head
of
a
powerful
party
of
youth
energy
and
vengeance
standing
between
the
passions
of
the
day
which
led
to
all
and
the
impotence
of
the
law
which
permitted
all
it
was
to
the
midst
of
this
fréron
mouthing
its
words
slurring
its
r
s
giving
its
word
of
honor
about
everything
that
morgan
now
made
his
way
it
must
be
admitted
that
this
in
spite
of
the
clothes
it
wore
in
spite
of
the
memories
these
clothes
evoked
was
wildly
gay
this
seems
incomprehensible
but
it
is
true
explain
if
you
can
that
dance
of
death
at
the
beginning
of
the
fifteenth
century
which
with
all
the
fury
of
a
modern
galop
led
by
musard
whirled
its
chain
through
the
very
cemetery
of
the
innocents
and
left
amid
its
tombs
fifty
thousand
of
its
votaries
morgan
was
evidently
seeking
some
one
a
young
dandy
who
was
dipping
into
the
of
a
charming
victim
with
an
ensanguined
finger
the
only
part
of
his
delicate
hand
that
had
escaped
the
almond
paste
tried
to
stop
him
to
relate
the
particulars
of
the
expedition
from
which
he
had
brought
back
this
bloody
trophy
but
morgan
smiled
pressed
his
other
hand
which
was
gloved
and
contented
himself
with
replying
i
am
looking
for
some
important
company
of
the
young
man
with
the
bloody
finger
let
him
pass
an
adorable
fury
as
corneille
would
have
called
her
whose
hair
was
held
up
by
a
dagger
with
a
blade
as
sharp
as
a
needle
barred
his
way
saying
morgan
you
are
the
handsomest
the
bravest
the
most
deserving
of
love
of
all
the
men
present
what
have
you
to
say
to
the
woman
who
tells
you
that
i
answer
that
i
love
replied
morgan
and
that
my
heart
is
too
narrow
to
hold
one
hatred
and
two
and
he
continued
on
his
search
two
young
men
who
were
arguing
one
saying
he
was
english
the
other
he
was
german
stopped
him
the
deuce
cried
one
here
is
the
man
who
can
settle
it
for
no
replied
morgan
trying
to
push
past
them
i
m
in
a
there
s
only
a
word
to
say
said
the
other
we
have
made
a
bet
and
i
that
the
man
who
was
tried
and
executed
at
the
chartreuse
du
seillon
was
according
to
him
a
german
and
according
to
me
an
i
don
t
know
replied
morgan
i
wasn
t
there
ask
hector
he
presided
that
tell
us
where
hector
is
tell
me
rather
where
tiffauges
is
i
am
looking
for
over
there
at
the
end
of
the
room
said
the
young
man
pointing
to
a
part
of
the
room
where
the
dance
was
more
than
usually
gay
and
animated
you
will
recognize
him
by
his
waistcoat
and
his
trousers
are
not
to
be
despised
i
shall
have
a
pair
like
them
made
with
the
skin
of
the
very
first
hound
i
morgan
did
not
take
time
to
ask
in
what
way
tiffauges
waistcoat
was
remarkable
or
by
what
queer
cut
or
precious
material
his
trousers
had
won
the
approbation
of
a
man
as
expert
in
such
matters
as
he
who
had
spoken
to
him
he
went
straight
to
the
point
indicated
by
the
young
man
saw
the
person
he
was
seeking
dancing
an
été
which
seemed
by
the
intricacy
of
its
weaving
if
i
may
be
pardoned
for
this
technical
term
to
have
issued
from
the
salons
of
vestris
himself
morgan
made
a
sign
to
the
dancer
tiffauges
stopped
instantly
bowed
to
his
partner
led
her
to
her
seat
excused
himself
on
the
plea
of
the
urgency
of
the
matter
which
called
him
away
and
returned
to
take
morgan
s
arm
did
you
see
him
tiffauges
asked
morgan
i
have
just
left
him
replied
the
latter
did
you
deliver
the
king
s
letter
to
did
he
read
it
at
has
he
sent
an
answer
two
one
verbal
one
written
the
second
dispenses
with
the
you
have
it
here
it
do
you
know
the
contents
a
positive
nothing
could
be
more
does
he
know
that
from
the
moment
he
takes
all
hope
away
from
us
we
shall
treat
him
as
an
enemy
i
told
him
what
did
he
answer
he
didn
t
answer
he
shrugged
his
what
do
you
think
his
intentions
are
it
s
not
difficult
to
does
he
mean
to
keep
the
power
himself
it
looks
like
the
power
but
not
the
throne
why
not
the
throne
he
would
never
dare
to
make
himself
oh
i
can
t
say
he
means
to
be
absolutely
king
but
i
ll
answer
for
it
that
he
means
to
be
but
he
is
nothing
but
a
soldier
of
fortune
my
dear
fellow
better
in
these
days
to
be
the
son
of
his
deeds
than
the
grandson
of
a
the
young
man
thought
a
moment
i
shall
report
it
all
to
cadoudal
he
said
and
add
that
the
first
consul
said
these
very
words
i
hold
the
vendée
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand
and
if
i
choose
in
three
months
not
another
shot
will
be
it
s
a
good
thing
to
you
know
it
let
cadoudal
know
it
and
take
just
then
the
music
ceased
the
hum
of
the
dancers
died
away
complete
silence
prevailed
and
in
the
midst
of
this
silence
four
names
were
pronounced
in
a
sonorous
and
emphatic
voice
these
four
names
were
morgan
montbar
adler
and
d
assas
pardon
me
morgan
said
to
tiffauges
they
are
probably
arranging
some
expedition
in
which
i
am
to
take
part
i
am
forced
therefore
to
my
great
regret
to
bid
you
farewell
only
before
i
leave
you
let
me
look
closer
at
your
waistcoat
and
trousers
of
which
i
have
heard
curiosity
of
an
amateur
i
trust
you
will
excuse
surely
exclaimed
the
young
vendéan
most
chapter
xxvii
the
bear
s
skin
with
a
rapidity
and
good
nature
that
did
honor
to
his
courtesy
he
went
close
to
the
candelabra
which
were
burning
on
the
the
waistcoat
and
trousers
seemed
to
be
of
the
same
stuff
but
what
was
that
stuff
the
most
experienced
connoisseur
would
have
been
puzzled
the
trousers
were
as
usual
of
a
light
tint
between
buff
and
flesh
color
the
only
remarkable
thing
about
them
was
the
absence
of
the
seam
and
the
closeness
with
which
they
clung
to
the
leg
the
waistcoat
on
the
other
hand
had
two
characteristic
signs
which
attracted
attention
it
had
been
pierced
by
three
balls
which
had
the
holes
gaping
and
these
were
stained
a
carmine
so
like
blood
that
it
might
easily
have
been
mistaken
for
it
on
the
left
side
was
painted
a
bloody
heart
the
distinguishing
sign
of
the
vendéans
morgan
examined
the
two
articles
with
the
closest
attention
but
without
result
if
i
were
not
in
such
a
hurry
said
he
i
should
like
to
look
into
the
matter
for
myself
but
you
heard
for
yourself
in
all
probability
some
news
has
reached
the
committee
government
money
probably
you
can
announce
it
to
cadoudal
only
we
shall
have
to
take
it
first
ordinarily
i
command
these
expeditions
if
i
delay
some
one
may
take
my
place
so
tell
me
what
your
waistcoat
and
trousers
are
made
my
dear
morgan
replied
the
vendéan
perhaps
you
have
heard
that
my
brother
was
captured
near
bressure
and
shot
by
the
blues
yes
i
know
the
blues
were
retreating
they
left
the
body
at
the
corner
of
the
hedge
we
were
pursuing
them
so
closely
that
we
arrived
just
after
them
i
found
the
body
of
my
brother
still
warm
in
one
of
his
wounds
a
sprig
was
stuck
with
these
words
shot
as
a
brigand
by
me
claude
flageolet
corporal
of
the
third
battalion
of
i
took
my
brother
s
body
and
had
the
skin
removed
from
his
breast
i
vowed
that
this
skin
pierced
with
three
holes
should
eternally
cry
vengeance
before
my
eyes
i
made
it
my
battle
ah
exclaimed
morgan
with
a
certain
astonishment
in
which
for
the
first
time
was
mingled
something
akin
to
terror
ah
then
that
waistcoat
is
made
of
your
brother
s
skin
and
the
trousers
oh
replied
the
vendéan
the
trousers
that
s
another
matter
they
are
made
of
the
skin
of
claude
flageolet
corporal
of
the
third
battalion
of
at
that
moment
the
voice
again
called
out
in
the
same
order
the
names
of
morgan
montbar
adler
and
d
assas
morgan
rushed
out
of
the
study
crossed
the
from
end
to
end
and
made
his
way
to
a
little
salon
on
the
other
side
of
the
his
three
companions
montbar
adler
and
d
assas
were
there
already
with
them
was
a
young
man
in
the
government
livery
of
a
bearer
of
despatches
namely
a
green
and
gold
coat
his
boots
were
dusty
and
he
wore
a
visored
cap
and
carried
the
the
essential
accoutrements
of
a
cabinet
courier
one
of
cassini
s
maps
on
which
could
be
followed
the
whole
lay
of
the
land
was
spread
on
the
table
before
saying
why
this
courier
was
there
and
with
what
object
the
map
was
unfolded
let
us
cast
a
glance
at
the
three
new
personages
whose
names
had
echoed
through
the
ballroom
and
who
are
destined
to
play
an
important
part
in
the
rest
of
this
history
the
reader
already
knows
morgan
the
achilles
and
the
paris
of
this
strange
association
morgan
with
his
blue
eyes
his
black
hair
his
tall
figure
graceful
easy
active
bearing
his
eye
which
was
never
without
animation
his
mouth
with
its
fresh
lips
and
white
teeth
that
was
never
without
a
smile
his
remarkable
countenance
composed
of
mingling
elements
that
seemed
so
foreign
to
each
other
strength
and
tenderness
gentleness
and
energy
and
through
it
all
that
bewildering
expression
of
gayety
that
was
at
times
alarming
when
one
remembered
that
this
man
was
perpetually
rubbing
shoulders
with
death
and
the
most
terrifying
of
all
deaths
that
of
the
scaffold
as
for
d
assas
he
was
a
man
from
to
years
of
age
with
bushy
hair
that
was
turning
gray
and
mustaches
as
black
as
ebony
his
eyes
were
of
that
wonderful
shade
of
indian
eyes
verging
on
maroon
he
was
formerly
a
captain
of
dragoons
admirably
built
for
struggle
whether
physical
or
moral
his
muscles
indicating
strength
and
his
face
obstinacy
for
the
rest
a
noble
bearing
great
elegance
of
manners
scented
like
a
dandy
carrying
either
from
caprice
or
luxury
a
bottle
of
english
or
a
vinaigrette
containing
the
most
subtle
perfumes
montbar
and
adler
whose
real
names
were
unknown
like
those
of
d
assas
and
morgan
were
commonly
called
by
the
company
the
imagine
damon
and
pythias
euryalus
and
nisus
orestes
and
pylades
at
one
joyous
loquacious
noisy
the
other
melancholy
silent
dreamy
sharing
all
things
dangers
money
mistresses
one
the
complement
of
the
other
each
rushing
to
all
extremes
but
forgetting
self
when
in
peril
to
watch
over
the
other
like
the
spartan
youths
on
the
sacred
legions
and
you
will
form
an
idea
of
montbar
and
adler
it
is
needless
to
say
that
all
three
were
companions
of
jehu
they
had
been
convoked
as
morgan
suspected
on
business
of
the
company
on
entering
the
room
morgan
went
straight
to
the
pretended
bearer
of
despatches
and
shook
hands
with
him
ah
the
dear
friend
said
the
latter
with
a
stiff
movement
showing
that
the
best
rider
can
not
do
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
on
with
impunity
you
are
taking
it
easy
you
parisians
hannibal
at
capua
slept
on
rushes
and
thorns
compared
to
you
i
only
glanced
at
the
ballroom
in
passing
as
becomes
a
poor
cabinet
courier
bearing
despatches
from
general
masséna
to
the
citizen
first
consul
but
it
seemed
to
me
you
were
a
fine
lot
of
victims
only
my
poor
friends
you
will
have
to
bid
farewell
to
all
that
for
the
present
disagreeable
unlucky
exasperating
no
doubt
but
the
house
of
jehu
before
my
dear
hastier
began
morgan
stop
cried
hastier
no
proper
names
if
you
please
gentlemen
the
hastiers
are
an
honest
family
in
lyons
doing
business
it
is
said
on
the
place
des
terreaux
from
father
to
son
and
would
be
much
humiliated
to
learn
that
their
heir
had
become
a
cabinet
courier
and
rode
the
highways
with
the
national
pack
on
his
back
lecoq
as
much
as
you
please
but
not
hastier
i
don
t
know
hastier
and
you
gentlemen
continued
the
young
man
addressing
montbar
adler
and
d
assas
do
you
know
him
no
replied
the
three
young
men
and
we
ask
pardon
for
morgan
who
did
my
dear
lecoq
exclaimed
morgan
that
s
right
interrupted
hastier
i
answer
to
that
name
well
what
did
you
want
to
tell
me
i
wanted
to
say
that
if
you
are
not
the
antipodes
of
the
god
harpocrates
whom
the
egyptians
represent
with
a
finger
on
his
lips
you
will
instead
of
indulging
in
a
lot
of
declamations
more
or
less
flowery
tell
us
why
this
costume
and
why
that
map
the
deuce
retorted
the
young
man
if
you
don
t
know
already
it
s
your
fault
and
not
mine
if
i
hadn
t
been
obliged
to
call
you
twice
caught
as
you
doubtless
were
in
the
toils
of
some
beautiful
eumenides
imploring
vengeance
of
a
fine
young
man
for
the
death
of
her
old
parents
you
d
know
as
much
as
these
gentlemen
and
i
wouldn
t
have
to
sing
an
encore
well
here
s
what
it
is
simply
of
the
remaining
treasure
of
the
berne
bears
which
general
lecourbe
is
sending
to
the
citizen
first
consul
by
order
of
general
masséna
a
trifle
only
a
hundred
thousand
francs
that
they
don
t
dare
send
over
the
jura
on
account
of
teysonnet
s
partisans
who
they
pretend
are
likely
to
seize
it
so
it
will
be
sent
by
geneva
bourg
mâcon
dijon
and
troyes
a
much
safer
way
as
they
will
find
when
they
try
very
good
we
were
informed
of
this
by
renard
who
started
from
gex
at
full
speed
and
transmitted
the
news
to
l
hirondelle
who
is
at
present
stationed
at
he
transmitted
it
to
me
lecoq
at
auxerre
and
i
have
done
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
to
transmit
it
in
turn
to
you
as
for
the
secondary
details
here
they
are
the
treasure
left
berne
last
octodi
nivôse
year
viii
of
the
republic
triple
and
indivisible
it
should
reach
genoa
duodi
and
leave
tridi
by
the
diligence
from
geneva
to
bourg
so
that
by
leaving
this
very
night
by
the
day
after
quintide
you
can
my
dear
sons
of
israel
meet
the
treasure
of
messires
the
bears
between
dijon
and
troyes
near
or
châtillon
what
say
you
by
heavens
cried
morgan
we
say
that
there
seems
to
be
no
room
for
argument
left
we
say
we
should
never
have
permitted
ourselves
to
touch
the
money
of
their
highnesses
the
bears
of
berne
so
long
as
it
remained
in
their
coffers
but
as
it
has
changed
hands
once
i
see
no
objection
to
its
doing
so
a
second
time
only
how
are
we
to
start
haven
t
you
a
yes
it
s
here
in
the
haven
t
you
horses
to
get
you
to
the
next
stage
they
are
in
the
haven
t
you
each
your
we
have
each
well
then
well
we
can
t
stop
the
diligence
in
a
we
don
t
put
ourselves
to
too
much
inconvenience
but
we
don
t
take
our
ease
in
that
well
and
why
not
asked
montbar
it
would
be
original
i
can
t
see
why
if
sailors
board
from
one
vessel
to
another
we
couldn
t
board
a
diligence
from
a
we
want
novelty
shall
we
try
it
adler
i
ask
nothing
better
replied
the
latter
but
what
will
we
do
with
the
postilion
that
s
true
replied
montbar
the
difficulty
is
foreseen
my
children
said
the
courier
a
messenger
has
been
sent
to
troyes
you
will
leave
your
at
delbauce
there
you
will
find
four
horses
all
saddled
and
stuffed
with
oats
you
will
then
calculate
your
time
and
the
day
after
or
rather
for
it
is
past
midnight
between
seven
and
eight
in
the
morning
the
money
of
messires
bruin
will
pass
an
anxious
quarter
of
an
shall
we
change
our
clothes
inquired
d
assas
what
for
replied
morgan
i
think
we
are
very
presentable
as
we
are
no
diligence
could
be
relieved
of
unnecessary
weight
by
better
dressed
fellows
let
us
take
a
last
glance
at
the
map
transfer
a
pâté
a
cold
chicken
and
a
dozen
of
champagne
from
the
to
the
pockets
of
the
coach
arm
to
the
teeth
in
the
arsenal
wrap
ourselves
in
warm
cloaks
and
clack
postilion
yes
cried
montbar
that
s
the
i
should
think
so
added
morgan
we
ll
kill
the
horses
if
necessary
and
be
back
at
seven
in
the
evening
in
time
to
show
ourselves
at
the
that
will
establish
an
alibi
observed
d
assas
precisely
said
morgan
with
his
imperturbable
gayety
how
could
men
who
applaud
mademoiselle
clotilde
and
vestris
at
eight
o
clock
in
the
evening
have
been
at
bar
and
chatillon
in
the
morning
settling
accounts
with
the
conductor
of
a
diligence
come
my
sons
a
last
look
at
the
map
to
choose
our
the
four
young
men
bent
over
cassini
s
map
if
i
may
give
you
a
bit
of
topographical
advice
said
the
courier
it
would
be
to
put
yourselves
in
ambush
just
beyond
massu
there
s
a
ford
opposite
to
the
riceys
see
there
and
the
young
man
pointed
out
the
exact
spot
on
the
map
i
should
return
to
chacource
there
from
chacource
you
have
a
department
road
straight
as
an
arrow
which
will
take
you
to
troyes
at
troyes
you
take
carriage
again
and
follow
the
road
to
sens
instead
of
that
to
coulommiers
the
donkeys
there
are
plenty
in
the
provinces
who
saw
you
in
the
morning
won
t
wonder
at
seeing
you
again
in
the
evening
you
ll
get
to
the
opera
at
ten
instead
of
eight
a
more
fashionable
hour
neither
seen
nor
recognized
i
ll
warrant
adopted
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
said
morgan
adopted
cried
the
other
three
in
chorus
morgan
pulled
out
one
of
the
two
watches
whose
chains
were
dangling
from
his
belt
it
was
a
masterpiece
of
petitot
s
enamel
and
on
the
outer
case
which
protected
the
painting
was
a
diamond
monogram
the
pedigree
of
this
beautiful
trinket
was
as
well
established
as
that
of
an
arab
horse
it
had
been
made
for
who
had
given
it
to
the
duchesse
de
polastron
who
had
given
it
to
morgan
s
mother
one
o
clock
said
morgan
come
gentlemen
we
must
relay
at
lagny
at
from
that
moment
the
expedition
had
begun
and
morgan
became
its
leader
he
no
longer
consulted
he
commanded
d
assas
who
in
morgan
s
absence
commanded
was
the
first
to
obey
on
his
return
half
an
hour
later
a
closed
carriage
containing
four
young
men
wrapped
in
their
cloaks
was
stopped
at
the
fontainebleau
barrier
by
the
who
demanded
their
passports
oh
what
a
joke
exclaimed
one
of
them
putting
his
head
out
of
the
window
and
affecting
the
pronunciation
of
the
day
passpawts
to
dwive
to
gwobois
to
call
on
citizen
word
of
fluted
honor
you
re
cwazy
fwend
go
on
dwiver
the
coachman
whipped
up
his
horses
and
the
carriage
passed
without
further
opposition
chapter
xxviii
family
matters
let
us
leave
our
four
on
their
way
to
lagny
where
thanks
to
the
passports
they
owed
to
the
obligingness
of
certain
clerks
in
citizen
fouché
s
employ
they
exchanged
their
own
horses
for
and
their
coachman
for
a
postilion
and
see
why
the
first
consul
had
sent
for
roland
after
leaving
morgan
roland
had
hastened
to
obey
the
general
s
orders
he
found
the
latter
standing
in
deep
thought
before
the
fireplace
at
the
sound
of
his
entrance
general
bonaparte
raised
his
head
what
were
you
two
saying
to
each
other
asked
bonaparte
without
preamble
trusting
to
roland
s
habit
of
answering
his
thought
why
said
roland
we
paid
each
other
all
sorts
of
compliments
and
parted
the
best
friends
in
the
how
does
he
impress
you
as
a
perfectly
how
old
do
you
take
him
to
be
about
my
age
at
the
so
i
think
his
voice
is
youthful
what
now
roland
can
i
be
mistaken
is
there
a
new
royalist
generation
growing
up
no
general
replied
roland
shrugging
his
shoulders
it
s
the
remains
of
the
old
well
roland
we
must
build
up
another
devoted
to
my
son
if
ever
i
have
roland
made
a
gesture
which
might
be
translated
into
the
words
i
don
t
bonaparte
understood
the
gesture
perfectly
you
must
do
more
than
not
object
said
he
you
must
contribute
to
a
nervous
shudder
passed
over
roland
s
body
in
what
way
general
he
asked
by
roland
burst
out
laughing
good
with
my
aneurism
he
asked
bonaparte
looked
at
him
and
said
my
dear
roland
your
aneurism
looks
to
me
very
much
like
a
pretext
for
remaining
do
you
think
so
yes
and
as
i
am
a
moral
man
i
insist
upon
does
that
mean
that
i
am
immoral
retorted
roland
or
that
i
cause
any
scandal
with
my
mistresses
augustus
answered
bonaparte
created
laws
against
celibates
depriving
them
of
their
rights
as
roman
augustus
well
i
ll
wait
until
you
are
augustus
as
yet
you
are
only
bonaparte
came
closer
to
the
young
man
and
laying
his
hands
on
his
shoulders
said
roland
there
are
some
names
i
do
not
wish
to
see
extinct
and
among
them
is
that
of
well
general
in
my
default
supposing
that
through
caprice
or
obstinacy
i
refuse
to
perpetuate
it
there
is
my
little
what
your
brother
then
you
have
a
brother
why
yes
i
have
a
brother
why
shouldn
t
i
have
brother
how
old
is
he
eleven
or
why
did
you
never
tell
me
about
him
because
i
thought
the
sayings
and
doings
of
a
youngster
of
that
age
could
not
interest
you
are
mistaken
roland
i
am
interested
in
all
that
concerns
my
friends
you
ought
to
have
asked
me
for
something
for
your
asked
what
general
his
admission
into
some
college
in
pooh
you
have
enough
beggars
around
you
without
my
swelling
their
you
hear
he
is
to
come
to
paris
and
enter
college
when
he
is
old
enough
i
will
send
him
to
the
ecole
militare
or
some
other
school
which
i
shall
have
founded
before
faith
general
said
roland
just
as
if
i
had
guessed
your
good
intentions
he
is
this
very
day
on
the
point
of
starting
for
what
for
i
wrote
to
my
mother
three
days
ago
to
bring
the
boy
to
paris
i
intended
to
put
him
in
college
without
mentioning
it
and
when
he
was
old
enough
to
tell
you
about
him
always
supposing
that
my
aneurism
had
not
carried
me
off
in
the
meantime
but
in
that
case
in
that
case
oh
in
that
case
i
have
left
a
bit
of
a
will
addressed
to
you
and
recommending
to
your
kindness
my
mother
and
the
boy
and
the
girl
in
short
the
whole
the
girl
who
is
she
my
so
you
have
a
sister
also
how
old
is
she
pretty
i
ll
take
charge
of
her
roland
began
to
laugh
what
s
the
matter
demanded
the
first
consul
general
i
m
going
to
put
a
placard
over
the
grand
entrance
to
the
what
will
you
put
on
the
placard
marriages
made
why
not
is
it
any
reason
because
you
don
t
wish
to
marry
for
your
sister
to
remain
an
old
maid
i
don
t
like
old
maids
any
better
than
i
do
old
i
did
not
say
general
that
my
sister
should
remain
an
old
maid
it
s
quite
enough
for
one
member
of
the
montrevel
family
to
have
incurred
your
then
what
do
you
mean
only
that
as
the
matter
concerns
my
sister
she
must
if
you
will
allow
it
be
ah
ha
some
provincial
is
there
i
can
t
say
i
left
poor
amélie
gay
and
happy
and
i
find
her
pale
and
sad
i
shall
get
the
truth
out
of
her
and
if
you
wish
me
to
speak
to
you
again
about
the
matter
i
will
do
yes
do
so
when
you
get
back
from
the
ah
so
i
am
going
to
the
vendée
why
is
that
like
marriage
repugnant
to
you
not
in
the
then
you
are
going
to
the
when
oh
you
need
not
hurry
providing
you
start
excellent
sooner
if
you
wish
tell
me
what
i
am
to
do
something
of
the
utmost
importance
the
devil
it
isn
t
a
diplomatic
mission
i
presume
yes
it
is
a
diplomatic
mission
for
which
i
need
a
man
who
is
not
a
then
i
m
your
man
general
only
you
understand
the
less
a
diplomatist
i
am
the
more
precise
my
instructions
must
i
am
going
to
give
them
to
you
do
you
see
that
map
and
he
showed
the
young
man
a
large
map
of
piedmont
stretched
out
on
the
floor
under
a
lamp
suspended
from
the
ceiling
yes
i
see
it
replied
roland
accustomed
to
follow
the
general
along
the
unexpected
dashes
of
his
genius
but
it
is
a
map
of
yes
it
s
a
map
of
so
there
is
still
a
question
of
italy
there
is
always
a
question
of
i
thought
you
spoke
of
the
vendée
why
general
you
are
not
going
to
send
me
to
the
vendée
and
go
yourself
to
italy
are
you
no
don
t
be
all
right
but
i
warn
you
if
you
did
i
should
desert
and
join
i
give
you
permission
to
do
so
but
now
let
us
go
back
to
excuse
me
general
this
is
the
first
time
you
have
mentioned
yes
but
i
have
been
thinking
of
him
for
a
long
time
do
you
know
where
i
shall
defeat
him
the
deuce
i
where
wherever
you
meet
bonaparte
laughed
ninny
he
said
with
loving
familiarity
then
stooping
over
the
map
he
said
to
roland
come
roland
stooped
beside
him
there
resumed
bonaparte
that
is
where
i
shall
fight
near
alessandria
within
eight
or
nine
miles
of
it
he
has
all
his
supplies
hospitals
artillery
and
reserves
in
alessandria
and
he
will
not
leave
the
neighborhood
i
shall
have
to
strike
a
great
blow
that
s
the
only
condition
on
which
i
can
get
peace
i
shall
cross
the
alps
he
pointed
to
the
great
i
shall
fall
upon
mélas
when
he
least
expects
me
and
rout
him
oh
trust
you
for
that
yes
but
you
understand
roland
that
in
order
to
quit
france
with
an
easy
mind
i
can
t
leave
it
with
an
inflammation
of
the
bowels
i
can
t
leave
war
in
the
ah
now
i
see
what
you
are
after
no
vendée
and
you
are
sending
me
to
the
vendée
to
suppress
that
young
man
told
me
some
serious
things
about
the
vendée
they
are
brave
soldiers
those
vendéans
led
by
a
man
of
brains
georges
cadoudal
i
have
sent
him
the
offer
of
a
regiment
but
he
won
t
jove
he
s
but
there
s
one
thing
he
little
who
cadoudal
yes
cadoudal
that
is
that
the
abbé
bernier
has
made
me
the
abbé
bernier
who
is
the
abbé
bernier
the
son
of
a
peasant
from
anjou
who
may
be
now
about
or
four
years
of
age
before
the
insurrection
he
was
curate
of
at
angers
he
refused
to
take
the
oath
and
sought
refuge
among
the
vendéans
two
or
three
times
the
vendée
was
pacificated
twice
she
was
thought
dead
a
mistake
the
vendée
was
pacificated
but
the
abbé
bernier
had
not
signed
the
peace
the
vendée
was
dead
but
the
abbé
bernier
was
still
alive
one
day
the
vendée
was
ungrateful
to
him
he
wished
to
be
appointed
general
agent
to
the
royalist
armies
of
the
interior
stofflet
influenced
the
decision
and
got
his
old
master
comte
colbert
de
maulevrier
appointed
in
bernier
s
stead
when
at
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
council
broke
up
the
abbé
bernier
had
disappeared
what
he
did
that
night
god
and
he
alone
can
tell
but
at
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
a
republican
detachment
surrounded
the
farmhouse
where
stofflet
was
sleeping
disarmed
and
defenceless
at
four
stofflet
was
captured
eight
days
later
he
was
executed
at
angers
the
next
day
autichamp
took
command
and
to
avoid
making
the
same
blunder
as
stofflet
he
appointed
the
abbé
bernier
general
agent
now
do
you
understand
well
the
abbé
bernier
general
agent
of
the
belligerent
forces
and
furnished
with
plenary
powers
by
the
comte
d
artois
the
abbé
bernier
has
made
overtures
to
to
you
to
bonaparte
to
the
first
consul
he
deigns
to
why
that
s
very
kind
of
the
abbé
bernier
have
you
accepted
them
yes
roland
if
the
vendée
will
give
me
peace
i
will
open
her
churches
and
give
her
back
her
and
suppose
they
chant
the
salvum
fac
regem
that
would
be
better
than
not
singing
at
all
god
is
omnipotent
and
he
will
decide
does
the
mission
suit
you
now
that
i
have
explained
it
yes
then
here
is
a
letter
for
general
hédouville
he
is
to
treat
with
the
abbé
bernier
as
the

he
said
and

to
two
hours
later
roland
was
rolling
along
in
a
on
the
road
to
orleans
the
next
day
at
nine
in
the
morning
he
entered
nantes
after
a
journey
of
hours
chapter
xxix
the
geneva
diligence
about
the
hour
when
roland
was
entering
nantes
a
diligence
heavily
loaded
stopped
at
the
inn
of
the
or
in
the
middle
of
the
main
street
of
in
those
days
the
diligences
had
but
two
compartments
the
coupé
and
the
interior
the
rotunda
is
an
adjunct
of
modern
times
the
diligence
had
hardly
stopped
before
the
postilion
jumped
down
and
opened
the
doors
the
travellers
dismounted
there
were
seven
in
all
of
both
sexes
in
the
interior
three
men
two
women
and
a
child
at
the
breast
in
the
coupé
a
mother
and
her
son
the
three
men
in
the
interior
were
one
a
doctor
from
troyes
the
second
a
watchmaker
from
geneva
the
third
an
architect
from
bourg
the
two
women
were
a
lady
s
maid
travelling
to
paris
to
rejoin
her
mistress
and
the
other
a
the
child
was
the
latter
s
nursling
which
she
was
taking
back
to
its
parents
the
mother
and
son
in
the
coupé
were
people
of
position
the
former
about
forty
years
of
age
still
preserving
traces
of
great
beauty
the
latter
a
boy
between
eleven
and
twelve
the
third
place
in
the
coupe
was
occupied
by
the
conductor
breakfast
was
waiting
as
usual
in
the
one
of
those
breakfasts
which
conductors
no
doubt
in
collusion
with
the
landlords
never
give
travellers
the
time
to
eat
the
woman
and
the
nurse
got
out
of
the
coach
and
went
to
a
baker
s
shop
nearby
where
each
bought
a
hot
roll
and
a
sausage
with
which
they
went
back
to
the
coach
settling
themselves
quietly
to
breakfast
thus
saving
the
cost
probably
too
great
for
their
means
of
a
meal
at
the
hotel
the
doctor
the
watchmaker
the
architect
and
the
mother
and
son
entered
the
inn
and
after
warming
themselves
hastily
at
the
large
entered
the
and
took
seats
at
the
table
the
mother
contented
herself
with
a
cup
of
coffee
with
cream
and
some
fruit
the
boy
delighted
to
prove
himself
a
man
by
his
appetite
at
least
boldly
attacked
the
viands
the
first
few
moments
were
as
usual
employed
in
satisfying
hunger
the
watchmaker
from
geneva
was
the
first
to
speak
faith
citizen
said
he
the
word
citizen
was
still
used
in
public
places
i
tell
you
frankly
i
was
not
at
all
sorry
to
see
daylight
this
can
not
monsieur
sleep
in
a
coach
asked
the
doctor
oh
yes
sir
replied
the
compatriot
of
on
the
contrary
i
usually
sleep
straight
through
the
night
but
anxiety
was
stronger
than
fatigue
this
were
you
afraid
of
upsetting
asked
the
architect
no
i
m
very
lucky
in
that
respect
it
seems
enough
for
me
to
be
in
a
coach
to
make
it
unupsettable
no
that
wasn
t
what
was
it
then
questioned
the
doctor
they
say
in
geneva
that
the
roads
in
france
are
not
that
s
according
to
circumstances
said
the
architect
ah
how
s
that
inquired
the
watchmaker
oh
replied
the
architect
if
for
example
we
were
carrying
government
money
we
would
surely
be
stopped
or
rather
we
would
have
been
do
you
think
so
queried
the
watchmaker
that
has
never
failed
i
don
t
know
how
those
devils
of
companions
of
jehu
manage
to
keep
so
well
posted
but
they
never
miss
an
the
doctor
nodded
affirmatively
ah
exclaimed
the
watchmaker
addressing
the
doctor
do
you
think
so
too
i
and
if
you
knew
there
was
government
money
in
the
coach
would
you
be
so
imprudent
as
to
take
passage
in
it
i
must
admit
replied
the
doctor
that
i
should
think
twice
about
and
you
sir
said
the
questioner
to
the
architect
oh
i
replied
the
latter
as
i
am
on
important
business
i
should
have
started
i
am
tempted
said
the
watchmaker
to
take
off
my
valise
and
my
oases
and
wait
for
s
diligence
because
my
boxes
are
filled
with
watches
worth
something
like
twenty
thousand
francs
we
ve
been
lucky
so
far
but
there
s
no
use
tempting
did
you
not
hear
these
gentlemen
say
remarked
the
lady
joining
in
the
conversation
for
the
first
time
that
we
run
the
risk
of
being
stopped
only
when
the
coach
carries
government
money
that
s
exactly
it
replied
the
watchmaker
looking
anxiously
around
we
are
carrying
the
mother
blanched
visibly
and
looked
at
her
son
before
fearing
for
herself
every
mother
fears
for
her
child
what
we
are
carrying
it
asked
the
doctor
and
the
architect
in
varying
tones
of
excitement
are
you
sure
of
what
you
are
saying
perfectly
sure
then
you
should
either
have
told
us
before
or
have
told
us
in
a
whisper
but
perhaps
said
the
doctor
the
gentleman
is
not
quite
sure
of
what
he
or
perhaps
he
is
joking
added
the
architect
heaven
forbid
the
genevese
are
very
fond
of
a
laugh
persisted
the
doctor
sir
replied
the
genevese
much
hurt
that
any
one
should
think
he
liked
to
laugh
i
saw
it
put
on
the
coach
what
the
was
there
much
a
good
many
but
where
does
the
money
come
from
the
treasury
of
the
bears
of
berne
you
know
of
course
that
the
bears
of
berne
received
an
income
of
fifty
or
even
sixty
thousand
the
doctor
burst
out
laughing
decidedly
sir
you
are
trying
to
frighten
us
said
he
gentlemen
said
the
watchmaker
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
take
your
places
gentlemen
shouted
the
conductor
opening
the
door

your
places
we
are
of
an
hour
one

the
architect

and

a
glass
of
wine

us

pleasure
gentlemen
a
glass
of

never
to
be
the
conductor
held
out
his
glass
and
the
three
travellers
touched
it
but
just
as
he
was
lifting
it
to
his
lips
the
doctor
stopped
his
arm
come
conductor
frankly
is
it
true

this
gentleman
says
and
he
pointed
to

genevese

french
government

the
conductor
to

the
doctor
asked
the
architect

the
conductor

that

the
best
thing
to
do
observed
the
latter

the
architect
and

added
the
watchmaker
come
gentlemen
take
your
seats
and
let
us
make
the
boy

listened
to
this
conversation
with
frowning
brow
and
clinched
teeth
well
he
said
to
his
mother

replied
the
child
unhesitatingly
edouard
exclaimed
his
mother
what
do
you
mean
i
wish
they
d
stop
the
diligence
that
i
do
cried
the
boy
his
eye
sparkling
with
determination
come
come
gentlemen
in
heaven

name

your
places
called
the
conductor
once
more
conductor
said
the
doctor
i
presume

have
no
weapons
yes

have
my
unfortunate
the
conductor
stooped
to
the
doctor
s
ear
and
whispered

t
be
alarmed
doctor
they
re
only
loaded
with
good
forward
postilion
forward
shouted
the
conductor
closing
the
door
of
the
interior
then
while
the
postilion
snapped
his
whip
and
started
the
heavy
vehicle
he
also
closed
that
of
the
coupé
are
you
not
coming
with
us
conductor
asked
the
lady
thank
you
no
madame
de
montrevel
replied
the
conductor
i
have
something
to
do
on
the
then
looking
into
the
window
he
added
take
care
the
monsieur
edouard
does
not
touch
the
pistols
in
the
pocket
of
the
carriage
he
might
hurt
pooh
retorted
the
boy
as
if
i
didn
t
know
how
to
handle
a
pistol
i
have
handsomer
ones
than
yours
that
my
friend
sir
john
had
sent
me
from
england
haven
t
i
mamma
never

edouard
replied
madame
de
montrevel
i
entreat
you
not
to
touch
don
t
worry
little
then
he
added
softly
all
the
same
if
the
companions
of
jehu
stop
us
i
know
what
i
shall
the
diligence
was
again
rolling
heavily
on
its
way
to
paris
it
was
one
of
those
fine
winter
days
which
makes
those
who
think
that
nature
is
dead
at
that
season
admit
that
nature
never
dies
but
only
sleeps
the
man
who
lives
to
be
seventy
or
eighty
years
of
age
has
his
nights
of
ten
or
twelve
hours
and
often
complains
that
the
length
of
his
nights
adds
to
the
shortness
of
his
days
nature
which
has
an
everlasting
existence
trees
which
live
a
thousand
years
have
sleeping
periods
of
four
or
five
months
which
are
winters
for
us
but
only
nights
for
them
the
poets
in
their
envious
verse
sing
the
immortality
of
nature
which
dies
each
autumn
and
revives
each
spring
the
poets
are
mistaken
nature
does
not
die
each
autumn
she
only
falls
asleep
she
is
not
resuscitated
she
awakens
the
day
when
our
globe
really
dies
it
will
be
dead
indeed
then
it
will
roll
into
space
or
fall
into
the
abysses
of
chaos
inert
mute
solitary
without
trees
without
flowers
without
verdure
without
poets
but
on
this
beautiful
day
of
the
of
february
sleeping
nature
dreamed
of
spring
a
brilliant
almost
joyous
sun
made
the
grass
in
the
ditches
on
either
side
of
the
road
sparkle
with
those
deceptive
pearls
of
the
hoarfrost
which
vanish
at
a
touch
and
rejoice
the
heart
of
a
tiller
of
the
earth
when
he
sees
them
glittering
at
the
points
of
his
wheat
as
it
pushes
bravely
up
through
the
soil
all
the
windows
of
the
diligence
were
lowered
to
give
entrance
to
this
earliest
smile
of
the
divine
as
though
all
hearts
were
saying
welcome
back
traveller
long
lost
in
the
clouds
of
the
west
or
beneath
the
heaving
billows
of
ocean
suddenly
about
an
hour
after
leaving
châtillon
the
diligence
stopped
at
a
bend
of
the
river
without
any
apparent
cause
four
horsemen
quietly
approached
walking
their
horses
and
one
of
them
a
little
in
advance
of
the
others
made
a
sign
with
his
hand
to
the
postilion
ordering
him
to
draw
up
the
postilion
obeyed
oh
mamma
cried
edouard
standing
up
and
leaning
out
of
the
window
in
spite
of
madame
de
montrevel
s
protestations
oh
mamma
what
fine
horses
but
why
do
these
gentlemen
wear
masks
this
isn
t
madame
de
montrevel
was
dreaming
a
woman
always
dreams
a
little
young
of
the
future
old
of
the
past
she
started
from
her
revery
put
her
head
out
of
the
window
and
gave
a
little
cry
edouard
turned
around
hastily
what
ails
you
mother
he
asked
madame
de
montrevel
turned
pale
and
took
him
in
her
arms
without
a
word
cries
of
terror
were
heard
in
the
interior
but
what
is
the
matter
demanded
little
edouard
struggling
to
escape
from
his
mother
s
encircling
arms
nothing
my
little
man
said
one
of
the
masked
men
in
a
gentle
voice
putting
his
head
through
the
window
of
the
coupé
nothing
but
an
account
we
have
to
settle
with
the
conductor
which
does
not
in
the
least
concern
you
travellers
tell
your
mother
to
accept
our
respectful
homage
and
to
pay
no
more
heed
to
us
than
if
we
were
not
then
passing
to
the
door
of
the
interior
he
added
gentlemen
your
servant
fear
nothing
for
your
money
or
jewels
and
reassure
that
nurse
we
have
not
come
here
to
turn
her
then
to
the
conductor
now
then
père
jérôme
we
have
a
hundred
thousand
francs
on
the
imperial
and
in
the
boxes
haven
t
we
gentlemen
i
assure
you
that
the
money
belongs
to
the
government
it
did
belong
to
the
bears
of
berne
seventy
thousand
francs
in
gold
the
rest
in
silver
the
silver
is
on
the
top
of
the
coach
the
gold
in
the
bottom
of
the
coupé
isn
t
that
so
you
see
how
well
informed
we
at
the
words
bottom
of
the
coupe
madame
de
montrevel
gave
another
cry
of
terror
she
was
about
to
come
in
contact
with
men
who
in
spite
of
their
politeness
inspired
her
with
the
most
profound
terror
but
what
is
the
matter
mother
what
is
the
matter
demanded
the
boy
impatiently
be
quiet
edouard
be
quiet
why
must
i
be
quiet
don
t
you
understand
the
coach
has
been
why
tell
me
why
ah
mother
i
no
no
said
madame
de
montrevel
you
don
t
those
gentlemen
are
take
care
you
don
t
say
what
you
mean
they
are
not
robbers
why
see
they
are
taking
the
conductor
s
sure
enough
one
of
the
four
was
fastening
to
the
saddle
of
his
horse
the
bags
of
silver
which
the
conductor
threw
down
from
the
imperial
no
repeated
madame
de
montrevel
no
they
are
not
then
lowering
her
voice
she
added
they
are
companions
of
ah
cried
the
boy
they
are
the
ones
who
assassinated
my
friend
sir
and
the
child
turned
very
pale
and
his
breath
came
hissing
through
his
clinched
teeth
at
that
moment
one
of
the
masked
men
opened
the
door
of
the
coupé
and
said
with
exquisite
politeness
madame
la
comtesse
to
our
great
regret
we
are
obliged
to
disturb
you
but
we
want
or
rather
the
conductor
wants
a
package
from
the
bottom
of
the
coupé
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
get
out
for
a
moment
jérôme
will
get
what
he
wants
as
quickly
as
then
with
that
note
of
gayety
which
was
never
entirely
absent
from
that
laughing
voice
he
added
won
t
you
jérôme
jérôme
replied
from
the
top
of
the
diligence
confirming
these
words
with
an
instinctive
movement
to
put
herself
between
the
danger
and
her
son
madame
de
montrevel
while
complying
with
that
request
pushed
edouard
behind
her
that
instant
sufficed
for
the
boy
to
seize
the
conductor
s
pistols
the
young
man
with
the
laughing
voice
assisted
madame
de
montrevel
from
the
coach
with
the
greatest
care
then
signed
to
one
of
his
companions
to
give
her
an
arm
and
returned
to
the
coach
but
at
that
instant
a
double
report
was
heard
edouard
had
fired
a
pistol
with
each
hand
at
the
companion
of
jehu
who
disappeared
in
the
smoke
madame
de
montrevel
screamed
and
fainted
away
various
cries
expressive
of
diverse
sentiments
echoed
that
of
the
mother
from
the
interior
came
one
of
terror
they
had
all
agreed
to
offer
no
resistance
and
now
some
one
had
resisted
from
the
three
young
men
came
a
cry
of
surprise
it
was
the
first
time
such
a
thing
had
happened
they
rushed
to
their
companion
expecting
to
find
him
reduced
to
pulp
but
they
found
him
safe
and
sound
laughing
heartily
while
the
conductor
with
clasped
hands
was
exclaiming
monsieur
i
swear
there
were
no
balls
monsieur
i
protest
they
were
only
charged
with
the
deuce
said
the
young
man
don
t
i
see
that
but
the
intention
was
good
wasn
t
it
my
little
edouard
then
turning
to
his
companions
he
added
confess
gentlemen
that
he
is
a
fine
boy
a
true
son
of
his
father
and
brother
of
his
brother
bravo
edouard
you
ll
make
a
man
some
day
taking
the
boy
in
his
arms
he
kissed
him
in
spite
of
his
struggles
on
both
cheeks
edouard
fought
like
a
demon
thinking
no
doubt
that
it
was
very
humiliating
to
be
embraced
by
a
man
at
whom
he
had
just
fired
two
pistols
in
the
meantime
one
of
the
companions
had
carried
edouard
s
mother
to
the
bank
by
the
roadside
a
little
distance
from
the
diligence
the
man
who
had
kissed
edouard
with
so
much
affection
and
persistence
now
looked
around
for
her
ah
cried
he
on
perceiving
her
madame
de
montrevel
still
unconscious
we
can
t
leave
a
woman
in
that
condition
gentlemen
conductor
take
master
placing
the
boy
in
jérôme
s
arms
he
turned
to
one
of
his
companions
man
of
precautions
said
he
haven
t
you
smelling
salts
or
a
bottle
of
essence
with
you
here
said
the
young
man
he
had
addressed
pulling
a
flask
of
toilet
vinegar
from
his
pocket
good
said
the
other
who
seemed
to
be
the
leader
of
the
band
do
you
finish
up
the
matter
with
master
jérôme
i
ll
take
charge
of
madame
de
it
was
indeed
time
the
fainting
fit
was
giving
place
to
a
violent
nervous
attack
spasmodic
movements
shook
her
whole
body
and
strangled
cries
came
from
her
throat
the
young
man
leaned
over
her
and
made
her
inhale
the
salts
madame
de
montrevel
presently
opened
her
frightened
eyes
and
called
out
edouard
edouard
with
an
involuntary
movement
she
knocked
aside
the
mask
of
the
man
who
was
supporting
her
exposing
his
face
the
courteous
laughing
young
man
our
readers
have
already
recognized
him
was
morgan
madame
de
montrevel
paused
in
amazement
at
sight
of
those
beautiful
blue
eyes
the
lofty
brow
and
the
gracious
lips
smiling
at
her
she
realized
that
she
ran
no
danger
from
such
a
man
and
that
no
harm
could
have
befallen
edouard
treating
morgan
as
a
gentleman
who
had
succored
her
and
not
as
a
bandit
who
had
caused
her
she
exclaimed
ah
sir
how
kind
you
in
the
words
in
the
tones
in
which
she
uttered
them
there
lay
a
world
of
thanks
not
only
for
herself
but
for
her
child
with
singular
delicacy
entirely
in
keeping
with
his
chivalric
nature
morgan
instead
of
picking
up
his
fallen
mask
and
covering
his
face
immediately
so
that
madame
de
montrevel
could
only
have
retained
a
fleeting
and
confused
impression
of
it
morgan
replied
to
her
compliment
by
a
low
bow
leaving
his
features
uncovered
long
enough
to
produce
their
impression
then
placing
d
assas
flask
in
madame
de
montrevel
s
hand
and
then
only
he
replaced
his
mask
madame
de
montrevel
understood
the
young
man
s
delicacy
ah
sir
said
she
be
sure
that
in
whatever
place
or
situation
i
see
you
again
i
shall
not
recognize
then
madame
replied
morgan
it
is
for
me
to
thank
you
and
repeat
how
kind
you
come
gentlemen
take
your
seats
said
the
conductor
in
his
customary
tone
as
if
nothing
unusual
had
happened
are
you
quite
restored
madame
or
should
you
like
a
few
minutes
more
to
rest
asked
morgan
the
diligence
shall
no
that
is
quite
unnecessary
i
feel
quite
well
and
am
much
indebted
to
morgan
offered
madame
de
montrevel
his
arm
and
she
leaned
upon
it
to
reach
the
diligence
the
conductor
had
already
placed
little
edouard
inside
when
madame
de
montrevel
had
resumed
her
seat
morgan
who
had
already
made
his
peace
with
the
mother
wished
to
do
so
with
the
son
without
a
grudge
my
young
hero
he
said
offering
his
hand
but
the
boy
drew
back
i
don
t
give
my
hand
to
a
highway
robber
he
replied
madame
de
montrevel
gave
a
start
of
terror
you
have
a
charming
boy
madame
said
morgan
only
he
has
his
then
bowing
with
the
utmost
courtesy
he
added
a
prosperous
voyage
madame
and
closed
the
door
forward
cried
the
conductor
the
carriage
gave
a
lurch
oh
pardon
me
sir
exclaimed
madame
de
montrevel
your
flask
keep
it
madame
said
morgan
although
i
trust
you
are
sufficiently
recovered
not
to
need
but
edouard
snatching
the
flask
from
his
mother
s
hands
flung
it
out
of
the
window
crying
mamma
doesn
t
receive
presents
from
the
devil
murmured
morgan
with
the
first
sigh
his
companions
had
ever
heard
him
give
i
think
i
am
right
not
to
ask
for
my
poor
amélie
in
then
turning
to
his
companions
he
said
well
gentlemen
is
it
finished
yes
they
answered
with
one
voice
then
let
us
mount
and
be
off
don
t
forget
we
have
to
be
at
the
opera
at
nine
o
clock
this
springing
into
his
saddle
he
was
the
first
to
jump
the
ditch
reach
the
river
and
there
unhesitatingly
took
the
ford
which
the
pretended
courier
had
pointed
out
on
cassini
s
map
when
he
reached
the
opposite
bank
followed
by
the
other
young
men
d
assas
said
to
him
say
didn
t
your
mask
falloff
yes
but
no
one
saw
my
face
but
madame
de
hum
muttered
d
assas

no
one
had
seen

their
horses
to
a
gallop
all
four
disappeared
across
the
fields
in
the

at
madame
de
montrevel
and
saw
clearly
from
the
expression
of
her
face
that

was
disagreeable
to
her

well
i
remember
de

his
beautiful
gardens
with

a
young
girl
who
seemed
its
queen

must
have
married
very
young
madame
at

you
could
not
have
been
older
to
have
a
son
of
roland
s
age
but
pray
sit
she
led
the
way
making
a
sign
to
madame
de
montrevel
to
sit
beside
her
and
that
charming
boy
she
said
pointing
to
edouard

he
also
your
son

she
gave
a
sigh
god

been
prodigal
to

has
given
you
all
you
can
desire

you
not
implore
him
to

to
edouard
s
forehead
my
husband
will
be
delighted
to
see
you
he
is
so
fond
of
your
son
madame
you
would
not
have

were
not
engaged
with
the
minister
of

for
that
matter

added
laughing

unfortunate
moment

madame
de
montrevel
frightened

is
so
i

on
the
contrary

sight
of

will
calm
him
i
don
t
know
just
what

the
matter

seems

stopped
on
the
outskirts
of
the
black
forest
in
broad
daylight
fouché
will
find
his
credit
in
danger

about
to
answer
when
the

opened
and
an
usher

madame
de
montrevel

said

josephine
bonaparte

countess

a
fair
man
with
a
pale
face
and
haggard
eye

looked
at

with
an
uneasiness
that
seemed
habitual
to
him
she
drew
hastily
aside
to
let
him

usher

her
movement

then
the
door
opened
and
madame
bonaparte
entered
leading
the
boy
by
the
hand
come
here
bonaparte
said
to
him
edouard
went
up
to
him
without
hesitation
and
made
a
military
salute
so
you
fired
at
the
robbers
twice
did
you
there
you
see
mamma
they
were
robbers
interrupted
the
child
of
course
they
were
robbers
i
should
like
to
hear
any
one
declare
they
were
not
was
it
you
who
fired
at
them
when
the
men
were
afraid
yes
it
was
i
general
but
unfortunately
that
coward
of
a
conductor
had
loaded
his
pistols
only
with
powder
otherwise
i
should
have
killed
their
then
you
were
not
afraid
i
replied
the
boy
no
i
am
never
you
ought
to
be
named
cornelia
madame
exclaimed
bonaparte
turning
to
madame
de
montrevel
who
was
leaning
on
josephine
s
arm
then
he
said
to
the
child
kissing
him
very
good
we
will
take
care
of
you
what
would
you
like
to
be
soldier
what
do
you
mean
by
first
why
first
a
soldier
then
later
a
colonel
like
my
brother
and
then
a
general
like
my
it
won
t
be
my
fault
if
you
are
not
answered
the
first
consul
nor
mine
retorted
the
boy
edouard
exclaimed
madame
de
montrevel
timidly
now
don
t
scold
him
for
answering
properly
and
bonaparte
lifting
the
child
to
the
level
of
his
face
kissed
him
you
must
dine
with
us
said
he
and
bourrienne
who
met
you
at
the
hotel
will
install
you
in
the
rue
de
la
victoire
you
must
stay
there
till
roland
gets
back
he
will
then
find
you
suitable
lodgings
edouard
shall
go
to
the
prytanée
and
i
will
marry
off
your
general
that
s
all
settled
with
then
turning
to
josephine
he
said
take
madame
de
montrevel
with
you
and
try
not
to
let
her
be
and
madame
de
montrevel
if
he
emphasized
the
words
wishes
to
go
to
a
milliner
prevent
it
she
can
t
want
bonnets
for
she
bought
last
then
giving
edouard
a
friendly
tap
he
dismissed
the
two
women
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
chapter
xxxi
the
son
of
the
miller
of
leguerno
we
have
said
that
at
the
very
moment
when
morgan
and
his
three
companions
stopped
the
geneva
diligence
between
and
châtillon
roland
was
entering
nantes
if
we
are
to
know
the
result
of
his
mission
we
must
not
grope
our
way
step
by
step
through
the
darkness
in
which
the
abbé
bernier
wrapped
his
ambitious
projects
but
we
must
join
him
later
at
the
village
of
muzillac
between
ambon
and
guernic
six
miles
above
the
little
bay
into
which
the
vilaine
river
falls
there
we
find
ourselves
in
the
heart
of
the
morbihan
that
is
to
say
in
the
region
that
gave
birth
to
the
chouannerie
it
was
close
to
laval
on
the
little
farm
of
the
poiriers
that
the
four
chouan
brothers
were
born
to
pierre
cottereau
and
jeanne
moyné
one
of
their
ancestors
a
misanthropical
woodcutter
a
morose
peasant
kept
himself
aloof
from
the
other
peasants
as
the
keeps
aloof
from
the
other
birds
hence
the
name
chouan
a
corruption
of
the
name
became
that
of
a
party
on
the
right
bank
of
the
loire
they
said
chouans
when
they
meant
bretons
just
as
on
the
left
bank
they
said
brigands
when
they
meant
vendéans
it
is
not
for
us
to
relate
the
death
and
destruction
of
that
heroic
family
nor
follow
to
the
scaffold
the
two
sisters
and
a
brother
nor
tell
of
battlefields
where
jean
and
rené
martyrs
to
their
faith
lay
dying
or
dead
many
years
have
elapsed
since
the
executions
of
perrine
rené
and
pierre
and
the
death
of
jean
and
the
martyrdom
of
the
sisters
the
exploits
of
the
brothers
have
passed
into
legends
we
have
now
to
do
with
their
successors
it
is
true
that
these
gars
lads
are
faithful
to
their
traditions
as
they
fought
beside
la
rouërie
and
bernard
de
villeneuve
so
did
they
fight
beside
bourmont
frotté
and
georges
cadoudal
theirs
was
always
the
same
courage
the
same
devotion
that
of
the
christian
soldier
the
faithful
royalist
their
aspect
is
always
the
same
rough
and
savage
their
weapons
the
same
gun
or
cudgel
called
in
those
parts
a
their
garments
are
the
same
a
brown
woollen
cap
or
a
hat
scarcely
covering
the
long
straight
hair
that
fell
in
tangles
on
their
shoulders
the
old
as
in
cæsar
s
day
they
are
the
same
bretons
with
wide
breeches
of
whom
martial
said
laxa
est
veteres
braccoe
britonis
to
protect
themselves
from
rain
and
cold
they
wore
goatskin
garments
made
with
the
long
hair
turned
outside
on
the
breasts
of
which
as
countersign
some
wore
a
scapulary
and
chaplet
others
a
heart
the
heart
of
jesus
this
latter
was
the
distinctive
sign
of
a
fraternity
which
withdrew
apart
each
day
for
common
prayer
such
were
the
men
who
at
the
time
we
are
crossing
the
borderland
between
the
and
morbihan
were
scattered
from
la
to
vannes
and
from
quertemberg
to
billiers
surrounding
consequently
the
village
of
muzillac
but
it
needed
the
eye
of
the
eagle
soaring
in
the
clouds
or
that
of
the
piercing
the
darkness
to
distinguish
these
men
among
the
gorse
and
heather
and
underbrush
where
they
were
crouching
let
us
pass
through
this
network
of
invisible
sentinels
and
after
fording
two
streams
the
affluents
of
a
nameless
river
which
flows
into
the
sea
near
billiers
between
arzal
and
dangau
let
us
boldly
enter
the
village
of
muzillac
all
is
still
and
sombre
a
single
light
shines
through
the
blinds
of
a
house
or
rather
a
cottage
which
nothing
distinguishes
from
its
fellows
it
is
the
fourth
to
the
right
on
entering
the
village
let
us
put
our
eye
to
one
of
these
chinks
and
look
in
we
see
a
man
dressed
like
the
rich
peasants
of
morbihan
except
that
gold
lace
about
a
finger
wide
stripes
the
collar
and
buttonholes
of
his
coat
and
also
the
edges
of
his
hat
the
rest
of
his
dress
consists
of
leathern
trousers
and
boots
his
sword
is
thrown
upon
a
chair
a
brace
of
pistols
lies
within
reach
of
his
hand
within
the
fireplace
the
barrels
of
two
or
three
muskets
reflect
the
light
of
a
blazing
fire
the
man
is
seated
before
a
table
a
lamp
lights
some
papers
which
he
is
reading
with
great
attention
and
illuminates
his
face
at
the
same
time
the
face
is
that
of
a
man
of
thirty
when
the
cares
of
a
partisan
warfare
do
not
darken
it
its
expression
must
surely
be
frank
and
joyous
beautiful
blond
hair
frames
it
great
blue
eyes
enliven
it
the
head
of
a
shape
peculiarly
breton
seems
to
show
if
we
believe
in
gall
s
system
an
exaggerated
development
of
the
organs
of
and
the
man
has
two
names
that
by
which
he
is
known
to
his
soldiers
his
familiar
name
is
and
his
real
name
received
from
brave
and
worthy
parents
georges
cadudal
or
rather
cadoudal
tradition
having
changed
the
orthography
of
a
name
that
is
now
historic
georges
was
the
son
of
a
farmer
of
the
parish
of
kerléano
in
the
commune
of
brech
the
story
goes
that
this
farmer
was
once
a
miller
georges
had
just
received
at
the
college
of
vannes
distant
only
a
few
leagues
from
brech
a
good
and
solid
education
when
the
first
appeals
for
a
royalist
insurrection
were
made
in
vendée
cadoudal
listened
to
them
gathered
together
a
number
of
his
companions
and
offered
his
services
to
stofflet
but
stofflet
insisted
on
seeing
him
at
work
before
he
accepted
him
georges
asked
nothing
better
such
occasions
were
not
long
to
seek
in
the
vendéan
army
on
the
next
day
there
was
a
battle
georges
went
into
it
with
such
determination
and
made
so
desperate
a
rush
that
de
maulevrier
s
former
huntsman
on
seeing
him
charge
the
blues
could
not
refrain
from
saying
aloud
to
bonchamp
who
was
near
him
if
a
cannon
ball
doesn
t
take
off
that
round
it
will
roll
far
i
warrant
the
name
clung
to
cadoudal
a
name
by
which
five
centuries
earlier
the
lords
of
malestroit
penhoël
beaumanoir
and
rochefort
designated
the
great
constable
whose
ransom
was
spun
by
the
women
of
brittany
there
s
the
big
round
head
said
they
now
we
ll
exchange
some
good
with
the
unfortunately
at
this
time
it
was
not
breton
against
english
but
frenchmen
against
frenchmen
georges
remained
in
vendée
until
after
the
defeat
of
savenay
the
whole
vendéan
army
was
either
left
upon
the
battlefield
or
vanished
in
smoke
for
three
years
georges
had
performed
prodigies
of
valor
strength
and
dexterity
he
now
crossed
the
loire
and
morbihan
with
only
one
man
left
of
all
who
had
followed
him
that
man
became
his
or
rather
his
he
never
left
him
and
in
memory
of
the
hard
campaign
they
had
made
together
he
changed
his
name
from
lemercier
to
tiffauges
we
have
seen
him
at
the
ball
of
the
victims
charged
with
a
message
to
morgan
as
soon
as
cadoudal
returned
to
his
own
part
of
the
country
he
fomented
insurrection
on
his
own
responsibility
bullets
respected
that
big
round
head
and
the
big
round
head
justified
stofflet
s
prediction
he
succeeded
la
rochejacquelin
d
elbée
bonchamp
lescure
even
stofflet
himself
and
became
their
rival
for
fame
their
superior
in
power
for
it
happened
and
this
will
give
an
idea
of
his
strength
that
cadoudal
almost
had
been
able
to
resist
the
government
of
bonaparte
who
had
been
first
consul
for
the
last
three
months
the
two
leaders
who
continued
with
him
faithful
to
the
bourbon
dynasty
were
frotté
and
bourmont
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
now
speaking
that
is
to
say
the
of
january
cadoudal
commanded
three
or
four
thousand
men
with
whom
he
was
preparing
to
blockade
general
hatry
in
vannes
during
the
time
that
he
awaited
the
first
consul
s
answer
to
the
letter
of
louis
xviii
he
had
suspended
hostilities
but
tiffauges
had
arrived
a
couple
of
days
before
with
it
that
letter
was
already
on
the
way
to
england
whence
it
would
be
sent
to
mittau
and
since
the
first
consul
would
not
accept
peace
on
the
terms
dictated
by
louis
cadoudal
of
louis
xviii
in
the
west
renewed
his
warfare
against
bonaparte
intending
to
carry
it
on
alone
if
necessary
with
his
friend
tiffauges
for
the
rest
the
latter
was
at
pouancé
where
conferences
were
being
held
between
châtillon
d
autichamp
the
abbé
bernier
and
general
hédouville
he
was
reflecting
this
last
survivor
of
the
great
warriors
of
the
civil
war
and
the
news
he
had
just
received
was
indeed
a
matter
for
deep
reflection
general
brune
the
conqueror
of
alkmaar
and
castricum
the
savior
of
holland
had
just
been
appointed
to
the
command
of
the
republican
forces
in
the
west
he
had
reached
nantes
three
days
previous
intending
at
any
cost
to
annihilate
cadoudal
and
his
chouans
at
any
cost
therefore
cadoudal
and
his
chouans
must
prove
to
the
that
they
knew
no
fear
and
had
nothing
to
expect
from
intimidation
just
then
the
gallop
of
a
horse
was
heard
the
rider
no
doubt
had
the
countersign
for
he
passed
without
difficulty
the
various
patrols
stationed
along
the
toad
to
la
and
entered
the
village
of
muzillac
also
without
difficulty
he
stopped
before
the
door
of
the
cottage
in
which
georges
was
sitting
the
latter
raised
his
head
listened
and
by
way
of
precaution
laid
his
hands
on
his
pistols
though
it
was
probable
that
the
was
a
friend
the
rider
dismounted
strode
up
the
path
and
opened
the
door
of
the
room
where
georges
was
waiting
ah
it
s
you
said
cadoudal
where
do
you
come
from
from
pouancé
what
news
a
letter
from
give
it
to
georges
snatched
the
letter
hastily
from
s
hand
and
read
it
ah
he
exclaimed
then
he
read
it
a
second
time
have
you
seen
the
man
whose
coming
he
speaks
of
inquired
cadoudal
yes
general
replied
the
courier
what
sort
of
a
man
is
he
a
handsome
young
fellow
of
or
what
manner
that
s
it
when
does
he
arrive
probably
did
you
him
along
the
road
yes
he
ll
come
do
it
again
nothing
must
happen
to
him
he
is
protected
by
that
s
understood
anything
more
to
say
the
advanced
guard
of
the
republicans
has
reached
la
how
many
men
about
a
thousand
they
have
a
guillotine
with
them
and
the
commissioner
of
the
executive
power
are
you
sure
i
met
them
on
the
road
the
commissioner
was
riding
near
the
colonel
and
i
recognized
him
perfectly
he
executed
my
brother
and
i
have
sworn
he
shall
die
by
my
own
and
you
ll
risk
your
life
to
keep
your
oath
at
the
first
perhaps
it
won
t
be
long
the
gallop
of
a
horse
echoed
through
the
street
ah
said
that
is
probably
the
man
you
no
replied
cadoudal
this
rider
comes
from
the
direction
of
the
sound
became
more
distinct
and
it
proved
that
cadoudal
was
right
the
second
horseman
like
the
first
halted
at
the
gate
dismounted
and
came
into
the
room
the
royalist
leader
recognized
him
at
once
in
spite
of
the
large
cloak
in
which
he
was
wrapped
is
it
you
bénédicité
he
asked
yes
where
do
you
come
from
from
vannes
where
you
sent
me
to
watch
the
blues
well
what
are
the
blues
doing
scaring
themselves
about
dying
of
hunger
if
you
blockade
the
town
in
order
to
procure
provisions
general
hatry
intends
to
carry
off
the
supplies
at
grandchamp
the
general
is
to
command
the
raid
in
person
and
to
act
more
quickly
only
a
hundred
men
are
to
are
you
tired
bénédicité
never
and
your
horse
he
came
fast
but
he
can
do
twelve
or
fifteen
miles
more
without
killing
give
him
two
hours
rest
a
double
feed
of
oats
and
make
him
do
on
those
conditions
he
can
do
start
in
two
hours
be
at
grandchamp
by
daybreak
give
the
order
in
my
name
to
evacuate
the
village
i
ll
take
care
of
general
hatry
and
his
column
is
that
all
you
have
to
say
no
i
heard
other
what
is
it
that
vannes
has
a
new
ha
so
they
are
giving
us
back
our
bishops
so
it
seems
but
if
they
are
all
like
this
one
they
can
keep
who
is
he
audrein
the
regicide
audrein
the
when
is
he
coming
or
i
shall
not
go
to
meet
him
but
let
him
beware
of
falling
into
my
men
s
bénédicité
and
burst
into
a
laugh
which
completed
cadoudal
s
thought
hush
cried
cadoudal
the
three
men
listened
this
time
it
is
probably
he
observed
georges
the
gallop
of
a
horse
could
be
heard
coming
from
the
direction
of
la
it
is
certainly
he
repeated
then
my
friends
leave
me
alone
you
bénédicité
get
to
grandchamp
as
soon
as
possible
you
post
thirty
men
in
the
courtyard
i
want
messengers
to
send
in
different
directions
by
the
way

some
one

best

be
got
for
supper
in
the
for
how
many
general
oh
are
you
going
out
no
only
to
meet
the
man
who
is
two
or
three
men
had
already
taken
the
horses
of
the
messengers
into
the
courtyard
the
messengers
themselves
disappeared
georges
reached
the
gate
on
the
street
just
as
a
horseman
pulling
up
his
horse
looked
about
him
and
seemed
to
hesitate
he
is
here
sir
said
georges
who
is
here
he
whom
you
how
do
you
know
whom
i
am
seeking
i
presume
it
is
georges
cadoudal
otherwise
called
then
i
bid
you
welcome
monsieur
roland
de
montrevel
for
i
am
the
person
you
ah
ah
exclaimed
the
young
man
amazed
then
dismounting
he
looked
about
as
if
for
some
one
to
take
his
mount
throw
the
bridle
over
your
horse
s
neck
and
don
t
be
uneasy
about
him
you
will
find
him
when
you
want
him
nothing
is
ever
lost
in
brittany
you
are
in
the
land
of
the
young
man
made
no
remark
threw
the
bridle
over
his
horse
s
neck
as
he
had
been
told
and
followed
cadoudal
who
walked
before
him
only
to
show
you
the
way
colonel
said
the
leader
of
the
chouans
they
both
entered
the
cottage
where
an
invisible
hand
had
just
made
up
the
fire
chapter
xxxii
white
and
blue
roland
entered
as
we
have
said
behind
georges
and
as
he
entered
cast
a
glance
of
careless
curiosity
around
him
that
glance
sufficed
to
show
him
that
they
were
alone
are
these
your
quarters
general
asked
roland
with
a
smile
turning
the
soles
of
his
boots
to
the
blaze
yes
they
are
singularly
georges
smiled
in
turn
do
you
say
that
because
you
found
the
road
open
from
la
here
he
asked
i
did
not
meet
a
that
does
not
prove
that
the
road
was
not
unless
by
the
owls
who
seemed
to
fly
from
tree
to
tree
and
accompanied
me
all
the
way
general
in
that
case
i
withdraw
my
exactly
replied
cadoudal
those
owls
were
my
sentinels
sentinels
with
good
eyes
inasmuch
as
they
have
this
advantage
over
the
eyes
of
men
they
can
see
in
the
it
is
not
the
less
true
that
i
was
fortunate
in
having
inquired
my
way
at
la
for
i
didn
t
meet
even
a
cat
who
could
have
told
me
where
to
find
but
if
you
had
raised
your
voice
at
any
spot
on
the
road
and
asked
where
shall
i
find
georges
cadoudal
a
voice
would
have
answered
at
the
village
of
muzillac
fourth
house
to
the
you
saw
no
one
colonel
but
at
that
very
moment
fifteen
hundred
men
or
thereabout
knew
that
colonel
roland
the
first
consul
s
was
on
his
way
to
a
conference
with
the
son
of
the
miller
of
but
if
they
knew
that
i
was
a
colonel
in
the
republican
service
and
to
the
first
consul
how
came
they
to
let
me
pass
because
they
were
ordered
to
do
then
you
knew
that
i
was
coming
i
not
only
knew
that
you
were
coming
but
also
why
you
have
roland
looked
at
him
fixedly
then
it
is
useless
for
me
to
tell
you
and
you
will
answer
me
even
though
i
say
nothing
you
are
about
the
deuce
i
should
like
to
have
a
proof
of
this
superiority
of
your
police
over
i
will
supply
it
i
shall
receive
it
with
much
satisfaction
especially
before
this
excellent
fire
which
also
seems
to
have
been
expecting
you
say
truer
than
you
know
colonel
and
it
is
not
the
fire
only
that
is
striving
to
welcome
you
yes
but
it
does
not
tell
me
any
more
than
you
have
done
the
object
of
my
your
mission
which
you
do
me
the
honor
to
extend
to
me
was
primarily
intended
for
the
abbé
bernier
alone
unhappily
the
abbé
bernier
in
the
letter
he
sent
his
friend
martin
duboys
presumed
a
little
on
his
strength
he
offered
his
mediation
to
the
first
pardon
me
interrupted
roland
you
tell
me
something
i
did
not
know
namely
that
the
abbé
bernier
had
written
to
general
i
said
he
wrote
to
his
friend
martin
duboys
which
is
very
different
my
men
intercepted
the
letter
and
brought
it
to
me
i
had
it
copied
and
forwarded
the
original
which
i
am
certain
reached
the
right
hands
your
visit
to
general
hédouville
proves
you
know
that
general
hédouville
is
no
longer
in
command
at
nantes
general
brune
has
taken
his
you
may
even
say
that
general
brune
commands
at
la
for
a
thousand
republican
soldiers
entered
that
town
about
six
o
clock
bringing
with
them
a
guillotine
and
the
citizen
thomas
millière
having
the
instrument
it
was
necessary
to
have
the
then
you
say
general
that
i
came
to
see
the
abbé
bernier
yes
the
abbé
bernier
had
offered
his
mediation
but
he
forgot
that
at
the
present
there
are
two
vendées
the
vendée
of
the
left
bank
and
the
vendée
of
the
right
bank
and
that
after
treating
with
d
autichamp
châtillon
and
suzannet
at
pouancé
it
would
still
be
necessary
to
negotiate
with
frotté
bourmont
and
cadoudal
and
where
that
no
one
could
tell
except
you
so
with
the
chivalry
that
is
the
basis
of
your
nature
you
undertook
to
bring
me
the
treaty
signed
on
the
the
abbé
bernier
d
autichamp
châtillon
and
suzannet
signed
your
pass
and
here
you
on
my
word
general
i
must
admit
that
you
are
perfectly
the
first
consul
desires
peace
with
all
his
heart
he
knows
that
in
you
he
has
a
brave
and
honorable
adversary
and
being
unable
to
meet
you
himself
since
you
were
not
likely
to
come
to
paris
he
expedited
me
to
you
in
his
that
is
to
say
to
the
abbé
that
can
hardly
matter
to
you
general
if
i
bind
myself
to
make
the
first
consul
ratify
what
may
be
agreed
upon
between
you
and
me
what
are
your
conditions
of
peace
they
are
very
simple
colonel
that
the
first
consul
shall
restore
his
majesty
louis
xviii
to
the
throne
that
he
himself
be
constable
by
land
and
sea
and
i
his
first
the
first
consul
has
already
replied
to
that
and
that
is
why
i
have
decided
to
reply
myself
to
his
when
this
very
night
if
occasion
in
what
way
by
resuming
but
are
you
aware
that
châtillon
d
autichamp
and
suzannet
have
laid
down
their
arms
they
are
the
leaders
of
the
vendéans
and
in
the
name
of
the
vendéans
they
can
do
as
they
see
fit
i
am
the
leader
of
the
chouans
and
in
the
name
of
the
chouans
i
shall
do
what
suits
then
you
condemn
this
unhappy
land
to
a
war
of
extermination
general
it
is
a
martyrdom
to
which
i
summon
all
christians
and
general
brune
is
at
nantes
with
the
eight
thousand
prisoners
just
returned
to
us
by
the
english
after
their
defeats
at
alkmaar
and
that
is
the
last
time
they
will
have
the
chance
the
blues
have
taught
us
the
bad
habit
of
not
making
prisoners
as
for
the
number
of
our
enemies
we
don
t
care
for
that
it
is
a
mere
if
general
brune
with
his
eight
thousand
men
joined
to
the
twenty
thousand
he
has
received
from
general
hédouville
is
not
sufficient
the
first
consul
has
decided
to
march
against
you
in
person
with
one
hundred
thousand
cadoudal
smiled
we
will
try
to
prove
to
him
he
said
that
we
are
worthy
to
fight
against
he
will
burn
your
we
shall
retire
to
our
he
will
burn
your
we
will
live
in
the
reflect
do
me
the
honor
to
remain
here
hours
colonel
and
you
will
see
that
my
reflections
are
already
i
am
tempted
to
only
colonel
don
t
ask
for
more
than
i
can
give
a
night
s
sleep
beneath
a
thatched
roof
or
wrapped
in
a
cloak
under
an
oak
tree
a
horse
to
follow
me
and
a
when
you
leave
i
have
i
your
word
colonel
that
you
will
not
interfere
with
any
orders
i
give
and
will
do
nothing
to
defeat
the
surprises
i
may
attempt
i
am
too
curious
to
see
for
that
you
have
my
word
whatever
takes
place
before
your
eyes
whatever
takes
place
before
my
eyes
i
renounce
the
rôle
of
actor
and
confine
myself
wholly
to
that
of
spectator
i
wish
to
say
to
the
first
consul
i
have
cadoudal
smiled
well
you
shall
see
said
he
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
two
peasants
brought
in
a
table
all
laid
on
which
stood
a
smoking
bowl
of
and
a
piece
of
lard
an
enormous
pot
of
cider
just
drawn
from
the
cask
was
foaming
over
the
edges
of
the
jug
between
two
glasses
a
few
buckwheat
cakes
served
as
a
desert
to
this
modest
repast
the
table
was
laid
for
two
you
see
monsieur
de
montrevel
that
my
lads
hoped
you
would
do
me
the
honor
to
sup
with
faith
they
were
not
far
wrong
i
should
have
asked
for
supper
had
you
not
invited
me
and
i
might
have
been
forced
to
seize
some
had
you
not
invited
then
fall
to
the
young
colonel
sat
down
gayly
excuse
the
repast
i
offer
you
said
cadoudal
unlike
your
generals
i
don
t
make
prize
money
my
soldiers
feed
me
have
you
anything
else
for
us
a
chicken
fricassee
that
s
your
dinner
monsieur
de
a
feast
now
i
have
but
one
fear
what
is
it
all
will
go
well
for
the
eating
but
when
it
comes
to
drinking
don
t
you
like
cider
the
devil
i
m
sorry
cider
or
water
that
s
my
oh
that
s
not
it
but
whose
health
are
we
going
to
drink
is
that
all
sir
said
cadoudal
with
great
dignity
we
will
drink
to
the
health
of
our
common
mother
france
we
are
serving
her
with
different
minds
but
i
hope
the
same
hearts
to
monsieur
said
cadoudal
filling
the
two
glasses
to
general
replied
roland
clinking
his
glass
against
that
of
georges
and
both
gayly
reseated
themselves
their
consciences
at
rest
and
attacked
the
soup
with
appetites
that
were
not
yet
thirty
years
old
chapter
xxxiii
the
law
of
retaliation
now
general
said
roland
when
supper
was
over
and
the
two
young
men
with
their
elbows
on
the
table
and
their
legs
stretched
out
before
the
blazing
fire
began
to
feel
that
comfortable
sensation
that
comes
of
a
meal
which
youth
and
appetite
have
seasoned
now
for
your
promise
to
show
me
things
which
i
can
report
to
the
first
you
promised
remember
not
to
object
to
yes
but
i
reserve
the
right
in
case
you
wound
my
conscience
too
severely
to
only
give
time
to
throw
a
saddle
on
the
back
of
your
horse
or
of
mine
if
yours
is
too
tired
colonel
and
you
are
very
as
it
happens
said
cadoudal
events
will
serve
you
i
am
here
not
only
as
general
but
as
judge
though
it
is
long
since
i
have
had
a
case
to
try
you
told
me
colonel
that
general
brune
was
at
nantes
i
knew
it
you
told
me
his
advanced
guard
was
only
twelve
miles
away
at
la
i
knew
that
also
but
a
thing
you
may
not
know
is
that
this
advanced
guard
is
not
commanded
by
a
soldier
like
you
and
me
but
by
citizen
thomas
millière
commissioner
of
the
executive
authorities
another
thing
of
which
you
may
perhaps
be
ignorant
is
that
citizen
thomas
millière
does
not
fight
like
us
with
cannon
guns
bayonets
pistols
and
swords
but
with
an
instrument
invented
by
your
republican
philanthropists
called
the
it
is
impossible
sir
cried
roland
that
under
the
first
consul
any
one
can
make
that
kind
of
ah
let
us
understand
each
other
colonel
i
don
t
say
that
the
first
consul
makes
it
i
say
it
is
made
in
his
and
who
is
the
scoundrel
that
abuses
the
authority
given
him
to
make
war
with
a
staff
of
executioners
i
have
told
you
his
name
he
is
called
thomas
millière
question
whom
you
please
colonel
and
throughout
all
vendée
and
brittany
you
ll
hear
but
one
voice
on
that
man
from
the
day
of
the
rising
in
vendée
and
brittany
now
six
years
ago
millière
has
been
always
and
everywhere
the
most
active
agent
of
the
terror
for
him
the
terror
did
not
end
with
robespierre
he
denounced
to
his
superiors
or
caused
to
be
denounced
to
himself
the
breton
and
vendéan
soldiers
their
parents
friends
brothers
sisters
wives
even
the
wounded
and
dying
he
shot
or
guillotined
them
all
without
a
trial
at
daumeray
for
instance
he
left
a
trail
of
blood
behind
him
which
is
not
yet
can
never
be
effaced
more
than
eighty
of
the
inhabitants
were
slaughtered
before
his
eyes
sons
were
killed
in
the
arms
of
their
mothers
who
vainly
stretched
those
bloody
arms
to
heaven
imploring
vengeance
the
successive
pacifications
of
brittany
and
vendée
have
never
slaked
the
thirst
for
murder
which
burns
his
entrails
he
is
the
same
in
that
he
was
in
well
this
man
roland
looked
at
the
general
this
man
continued
the
general
with
the
utmost
calmness
is
to
die
seeing
that
society
did
not
condemn
him
i
have
condemned
what
die
at
la
in
the
midst
of
the
republicans
in
spite
of
his
bodyguard
of
assassins
and
executioners
his
hour
has
struck
he
is
to
cadoudal
pronounced
these
words
with
such
solemnity
that
no
doubt
remained
in
roland
s
mind
not
only
as
to
the
sentence
but
also
the
execution
of
it
he
was
thoughtful
for
an
instant
and
you
believe
that
you
have
the
right
to
judge
and
condemn
that
man
guilty
as
he
is
yes
for
that
man
has
judged
and
condemned
not
the
guilty
but
the
if
i
said
to
you
on
my
return
to
paris
i
will
demand
the
arrest
and
trial
of
that
man
would
you
not
trust
my
word
i
would
trust
your
word
but
i
should
say
to
you
a
maddened
wild
beast
escapes
from
its
cage
a
murderer
from
his
prison
men
are
men
subject
to
error
they
have
sometimes
condemned
the
innocent
they
might
spare
the
my
justice
is
more
certain
than
yours
colonel
for
it
is
the
justice
of
god
the
man
will
and
by
what
right
do
you
claim
that
your
justice
the
justice
of
a
man
liable
to
error
like
other
men
is
the
justice
of
god
because
i
have
made
god
a
sharer
in
that
justice
oh
my
condemnation
of
that
man
is
not
of
how
do
you
mean
in
the
midst
of
a
storm
when
thunder
roared
without
cessation
and
the
lightning
flashed
from
minute
to
minute
i
raised
my
arms
to
heaven
and
i
said
to
god
o
god
whose
look
is
that
lightning
whose
voice
is
that
thunder
if
this
man
ought
to
die
extinguish
that
lightning
still
the
thunder
for
ten
minutes
the
silence
of
the
skies
the
darkness
of
the
heavens
shall
be
thy
answer
watch
in
hand
i
counted
eleven
minutes
without
a
flash
or
a
sound
i
saw
at
the
point
of
a
promontory
a
boat
tossed
by
a
terrible
tempest
a
boat
with
but
one
man
in
it
in
danger
every
minute
of
sinking
a
wave
lifted
it
as
the
breath
of
an
infant
lifts
a
plume
and
cast
it
on
the
rocks
the
boat
flew
to
pieces
the
man
clung
to
the
rock
and
all
the
people
cried
out
he
is
lost
his
father
was
there
his
two
brothers
were
there
but
none
dared
to
succor
him
i
raised
my
arms
to
the
lord
and
said
if
millière
is
condemned
by
thee
as
by
me
o
god
let
me
save
that
man
with
no
help
but
thine
let
me
save
him
i
stripped
i
knotted
a
rope
around
my
arm
and
i
swam
to
the
rock
the
water
seemed
to
subside
before
my
breast
i
reached
the
man
his
father
and
brothers
held
the
rope
he
gained
the
land
i
could
have
returned
as
he
did
fastening
the
rope
to
the
rocks
i
flung
it
away
from
me
i
trusted
to
god
and
cast
myself
into
the
waves
they
floated
me
gently
and
surely
to
the
shore
even
as
the
waters
of
the
nile
bore
moses
basket
to
pharaoh
s
daughter
the
enemy
s
outposts
were
stationed
around
the
village
of
i
was
hidden
in
the
woods
of
grandchamp
with
fifty
men
recommending
my
soul
to
god
i
left
the
woods
alone
lord
god
i
said
if
it
be
thy
will
that
millière
die
let
that
sentry
fire
upon
me
and
miss
me
then
i
will
return
to
my
men
and
leave
that
sentry
unharmed
for
thou
wilt
have
been
with
him
for
an
i
walked
to
the
republican
at
twenty
paces
he
fired
and
missed
me
here
is
the
hole
in
my
hat
an
inch
from
my
head
the
hand
of
god
had
aimed
that
weapon
that
happened
yesterday
i
thought
that
millière
was
at
nantes
they
came
and
told
me
that
millière
and
his
guillotine
were
at
la
then
i
said
god
has
brought
him
to
me
he
shall
roland
listened
with
a
certain
respect
to
the
superstitious
narrative
of
the
breton
leader
he
was
not
surprised
to
find
such
beliefs
and
such
poetry
in
a
man
born
in
face
of
a
savage
sea
among
the
druid
monuments
of
karnac
he
realized
that
millière
was
indeed
condemned
and
that
god
who
had
thrice
seemed
to
approve
his
judgment
alone
could
save
him
but
one
last
question
occurred
to
him
how
will
you
strike
him
he
asked
oh
said
georges
i
do
not
trouble
myself
about
that
he
will
be
one
of
the
two
men
who
had
brought
in
the
supper
table
now
entered
the
room
said
cadoudal
tell
that
i
wish
to
speak
to
two
minutes
later
the
breton
presented
himself
said
cadoudal
did
you
not
tell
me
that
the
murderer
thomas
millière
was
at
i
saw
him
enter
the
town
side
by
side
with
the
republican
colonel
who
did
not
seem
particularly
flattered
by
such
did
you
not
add
that
he
was
followed
by
his
guillotine
i
told
you
his
guillotine
followed
between
two
cannon
and
i
believe
if
the
cannon
could
have
got
away
the
guillotine
would
have
been
left
to
go
its
way
what
precautions
does
millière
take
in
the
towns
he
visits
he
has
a
special
guard
about
him
and
the
streets
around
his
house
are
barricaded
he
carries
pistols
always
at
in
spite
of
that
guard
in
spite
of
that
barricade
and
the
pistols
will
you
undertake
to
reach
him
i
will
because
of
his
crimes
i
have
condemned
that
man
he
must
ah
exclaimed
the
day
of
justice
has
come
at
last
will
you
undertake
to
execute
my
sentence
i
will
go
then
take
the
number
of
men
you
need
devise
what
stratagem
you
please
but
reach
the
man
and
if
i
die
general
fear
not
the
curate
of
leguerno
shall
say
enough
masses
in
your
behalf
to
keep
your
poor
soul
out
of
purgatory
but
you
will
not
die
that
s
all
right
general
now
that
i
am
sure
of
the
masses
i
ask
nothing
more

have
my

men

an
hour
and
they

that
time
i
might
have
asked
for
five
hundred

thousand

have
responded
as

he
opened
the
door
and
called
out
or
two
seconds
later
or
appeared

is
my
said
cadoudal
laughing
he
fulfils
the
same
functions
for
me
that
general
berthier
does
for
the
first
consul
or
how
many
men
are
stationed
along
the

a
sign
with
his
head
and
bénédicité
went
out

cadoudal
simply
about
five
thousand
well
with
those
five
thousand
men
all
belonging
to
this
country
who
know
every
tree
every
stone
every
bush
i
can
make
war
against
the
hundred
thousand
men
the
first
consul
threatens
to

roland
smiled
you
think
that
is
saying
too
much
don

you
i
think
you
are
boasting
a
little
general
boasting
of
your
men
no

my
auxiliaries

whole
population
none
of
your
generals
can
make
a
move
unknown
to
me

my
intercepting
it
find
a
retreat
where
i
shall
not
pursue
him

royalist
and
christian

default
of
the
inhabitants

speaks
and
tells
me

blues

here
the
slaughterers

hidden
there

the
rest

can
judge
for
how
we
are
going
on
an
expedition
about
miles
from
here
what
time
is
it
both
young
men
looked
at
their
watches
quarter
to
twelve
they
said
together
good
said
georges
our
watches
agree
that
is
a
good
sign
perhaps
some
day
our
hearts
will
do
the
you
were
saying
general
i
was
saying
that
it
was
a
quarter
to
twelve
colonel
and

at
six
o

the
two
young
men
wrapped
themselves
in
their
cloaks
and
went
out
at
the
door
roland
collided
against
a
small
group
of
five
men
these
five
men
wore
republican
uniforms
one
of
them
had
sergeant
stripes
on
his
sleeve

roland

cadoudal
laughing
but
who
are
these
men
and
his
party

are
starting
on
that
expedition

know
then
they
expect

means
of

uniform

turning
to
the
little
group

the
man

the
stripes

his
sleeves

group

to
cadoudal

cadoudal
how
easy
it
all
is

of
these
two
horses

i
to
take
asked
roland
either
one

as
good
as
the
other
each
has
an
excellent
pair
of
english
pistols
in
its
loaded
and
colonel
that
s
a
job
i
never
trust
to
any
then
we
ll
the
two
young
men
were
soon
in
their
saddles
and
on
the
road
to
vannes
cadoudal
guiding
roland
and
or
the
of
the
army
as
georges
called
him
following
about
twenty
paces
in
the
rear
when
they
reached
the
end
of
the
village
roland
darted
his
eyes
along
the
road
which
stretches
in
a
straight
line
from
muzillac
to
the
trinité
the
road
fully
exposed
to
view
seemed
absolutely
solitary
they
rode
on
for
about
a
mile
and
a
half
then
roland
said
but
where
the
devil
are
your
men
to
right
and
left
before
and
behind
ha
what
a
joke
it
s
not
a
joke
colonel
do
you
think
i
should
be
so
rash
as
to
risk
myself
thus
without
scouts
you
told
me
i
think
that
if
i
wished
to
see
your
men
i
had
only
to
say
i
did
say
well
i
wish
to
see
wholly
or
in
part
how
many
did
you
say
were
with
you
three
well
i
want
to
see
one
hundred
and
halt
cried
cadoudal
putting
his
hands
to
his
mouth
he
gave
the
hoot
of
the
followed
by
the
cry
of
an
owl
but
he
threw
the
hoot
to
the
right
and
the
cry
to
the
left
almost
instantly
on
both
sides
of
the
road
human
forms
could
be
seen
in
motion
bounding
over
the
ditch
which
separated
the
bushes
from
the
road
and
then
ranging
themselves
beside
the
horses
who
commands
on
the
right
asked
cadoudal
i
moustache
replied
a
peasant
coming
near
who
commands
on
the
left
repeated
the
general
i
replied
another
peasant
also
approaching
him
how
many
men
are
with
you
moustache
one
how
many
men
are
with
you
one
hundred
and
fifty
in
all
then
asked
georges
yes
replied
the
two
breton
leaders
is
that
your
number
colonel
asked
cadoudal
laughing
you
are
a
magician
no
i
am
a
poor
peasant
like
them
only
i
command
a
troop
in
which
each
brain
knows
what
it
does
each
heart
beats
singly
for
the
two
great
principles
of
this
world
religion
and
then
turning
to
his
men
cadoudal
asked
who
commands
the
advanced
guard
air
replied
the
two
chouans
and
the
la
the
second
reply
was
made
with
the
same
unanimity
as
the
first
then
we
can
safely
continue
our
way
yes
general
as
if
you
were
going
to
mass
in
your
own
let
us
ride
on
then
colonel
said
cadoudal
to
roland
then
turning
to
his
men
he
cried
be
lively
my
instantly
every
man
jumped
the
ditch
and
disappeared
for
a
few
seconds
the
crackling
of
twigs
on
the
bushes
and
the
sound
of
steps
among
the
underbrush
was
heard
then
all
was
silent
well
asked
cadoudal
do
you
think
that
with
such
men
i
have
anything
to
fear
from
the
blues
brave
as
they
may
be
roland
heaved
a
sigh
he
was
of
cadoudal
s
opinion
they
rode
on
about
three
miles
from
trinité
they
caught
sight
of
a
black
spot
approaching
along
the
road
with
great
rapidity
as
it
became
more
distinct
this
spot
stopped
suddenly
what
is
that
asked
roland
as
you
see
a
man
replied
cadoudal
of
course
but
who
is
this
man
you
might
have
guessed
from
the
rapidity
of
his
coming
he
is
a
why
does
he
stop
because
he
has
seen
us
and
does
not
know
whether
to
advance
or
what
will
he
do
wait
before
for
what
a
will
he
answer
the
signal
he
will
not
only
answer
but
obey
it
will
you
have
him
advance
or
retreat
or
will
you
have
him
step
i
wish
him
to
advance
by
that
means
we
shall
know
the
news
he
cadoudal
gave
the
call
of
the
cuckoo
with
such
perfection
that
roland
looked
about
him
for
the
bird
it
was
i
said
cadoudal
you
need
not
look
for
is
the
messenger
going
to
come
to
he
is
the
messenger
had
already
started
and
was
rapidly
approaching
in
a
few
seconds
he
was
beside
his
general
ah
said
the
latter
is
that
you
assaut
the
general
stooped
and
assaut
said
a
few
words
in
his
ear
bénédicité
has
already
warned
me
said
georges
then
turning
to
roland
he
said
something
of
importance
is
to
happen
in
the
village
of
the
trinité
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
which
you
ought
to
see
come
hurry
and
setting
the
example
he
put
his
horse
to
a
gallop
roland
did
the
same
when
they
reached
the
village
they
could
see
from
a
distance
by
the
light
of
some
pine
torches
a
tumultuous
mob
in
the
market
square
the
cries
and
movements
of
this
mob
bespoke
some
grave
occurrence
fast
fast
cried
cadoudal
roland
asked
no
better
he
dug
his
spurs
in
his
horse
s
belly
at
the
clatter
of
horses
hoofs
the
peasants
scattered
there
were
five
or
six
hundred
of
them
at
least
all
armed
cadoudal
and
roland
found
themselves
in
a
circle
of
light
in
the
midst
of
cries
and
agitation
the
crowd
was
pressing
more
particularly
toward
the
opening
of
a
street
which
led
to
the
village
of
tridon
a
diligence
was
coming
down
that
street
escorted
by
a
dozen
chouans
two
on
either
side
of
the
postilion
ten
others
guarding
the
doors
the
carriage
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
all
were
so
intent
upon
the
diligence
that
they
paid
but
scant
attention
to
cadoudal
hola
shouted
georges
what
is
all
this
at
this
well
known
voice
everyone
turned
round
and
heads
were
uncovered
the
big
round
head
they
murmured
yes
said
cadoudal
a
man
went
up
to
georges
didn
t
bénédicité
and
assaut
notify
you
he
inquired
yes
is
that
the
diligence
from
ploermel
to
vannes
that
you
are
bringing
back
yes
general
it
was
stopped
between
tréfléon
and
is
he
in
it
we
think
act
according
to
your
consciences
if
it
is
a
crime
toward
god
take
it
on
yourselves
i
take
only
the
responsibility
toward
men
i
will
be
present
at
what
takes
place
but
i
will
not
share
in
it
either
to
hinder
or
well
demanded
a
hundred
voices
what
does
he
say
he
says
we
must
act
according
to
our
consciences
and
that
he
washes
his
hands
of
long
live
the
big
round
head
cried
all
the
people
rushing
toward
the
diligence
cadoudal
remained
motionless
in
the
midst
of
this
crowd
roland
stood
near
him
also
motionless
but
full
of
curiosity
for
he
was
completely
ignorant
of
who
or
what
was
in
question
the
man
who
had
just
spoken
to
cadoudal
and
whom
his
companions
called
opened
the
door
the
travellers
were
huddled
together
and
trembling
in
the
darkness
within
if
you
have
nothing
to
reproach
yourselves
with
against
god
or
the
king
said
in
a
full
sonorous
voice
descend
without
fear
we
are
not
brigands
we
are
christians
and
this
declaration
no
doubt
reassured
the
travellers
for
a
man
got
out
then
two
women
then
a
mother
pressing
her
child
in
her
arms
and
finally
another
man
the
chouans
examined
them
attentively
as
they
came
down
the
carriage
steps
not
finding
the
man
they
wanted
they
said
to
each
traveller
pass
one
man
alone
remained
in
the
coach
a
chouan
thrust
a
torch
in
the
vehicle
and
by
its
light
they
could
see
he
was
a
priest
minister
of
the
lord
said
why
did
you
not
descend
with
the
others
did
you
not
hear
me
say
we
were
christians
and
royalists
the
priest
did
not
move
but
his
teeth
chattered
why
this
terror
continued
does
not
your
cloth
plead
for
you
the
man
who
wears
a
cassock
can
have
done
nothing
against
royalty
or
the
priest
crouched
back
murmuring
mercy
mercy
why
mercy
demanded
do
you
feel
that
you
are
guilty
wretch
oh
oh
exclaimed
roland
is
that
how
you
royalists
and
christians
speak
to
a
man
of
god
that
man
said
cadoudal
is
not
a
man
of
god
but
a
man
of
the
who
is
he
then
both
an
atheist
and
a
regicide
he
denied
his
god
and
voted
for
the
death
of
the
king
that
is
the
conventional
roland
shuddered
what
will
they
do
he
asked
he
gave
death
he
will
receive
death
answered
cadoudal
during
this
time
the
chouans
had
pulled
audrein
out
of
the
diligence
ha
is
it
you
bishop
of
vannes
cried
mercy
begged
the
bishop
we
were
informed
of
your
arrival
and
were
waiting
for
mercy
repeated
the
bishop
for
the
third
time
have
you
your
pontifical
robes
with
you
yes
my
friends
i
then
dress
yourself
as
a
prelate
it
is
long
since
we
have
seen
a
trunk
marked
with
the
prelate
s
name
was
taken
from
the
diligence
and
opened
they
took
the
bishop
s
robes
from
it
and
handed
them
to
audrein
who
put
them
on
then
when
every
vestment
was
in
its
place
the
peasants
ranged
themselves
in
a
circle
each
with
his
musket
in
his
hand
the
glare
of
the
torches
was
reflected
on
the
barrels
casting
evil
gleams
two
men
took
the
priest
and
led
him
into
the
circle
supporting
him
beneath
his
arms
he
was
pale
as
death
there
was
a
moment
of
lugubrious
silence
a
voice
broke
it
it
was
that
of
we
are
about
to
judge
you
said
the
chouan
priest
of
god
you
have
betrayed
the
church
child
of
france
you
have
condemned
your
king
to
alas
alas
stammered
the
priest
is
it
true
i
do
not
deny
because
it
is
impossible
to
deny
what
have
you
to
say
in
justification
citizens
we
are
not
citizens
cried
in
a
voice
thunder
we
are
gentlemen
we
are
not
gentlemen
we
are
my
friends
we
are
not
your
friends
we
are
your
judges
you
judges
are
questioning
you
i
repent
of
what
i
did
and
i
ask
pardon
of
god
and
men
can
not
pardon
you
replied
the
same
implacable
voice
for
pardoned
you
would
sin
you
may
change
your
skin
but
never
your
heart
you
have
nothing
to
expect
from
men
but
death
as
for
god
implore
his
the
regicide
bowed
his
head
the
renegade
bent
his
knee
but
suddenly
drawing
himself
up
he
cried
i
voted
the
king
s
death
it
is
true
but
with
a
reservation
what
reservation
the
time
of
the
sooner
or
later
it
was
still
the
king
s
death
which
you
voted
and
the
king
was
true
true
said
the
priest
but
i
was
then
you
are
not
only
a
regicide
and
an
apostate
but
also
a
coward
we
are
not
priests
but
we
are
more
just
than
you
you
voted
the
death
of
the
innocent
we
vote
the
death
of
the
guilty
you
have
ten
minutes
in
which
to
prepare
to
meet
your
the
bishop
gave
a
cry
of
terror
and
fell
upon
both
knees
the
church
bells
rang
as
if
of
their
own
impulse
and
two
of
the
men
present
accustomed
to
the
offices
of
the
church
intoned
the
prayers
for
the
dying
it
was
some
time
before
the
bishop
found
words
with
which
to
respond
he
turned
affrighted
glances
in
supplication
to
his
judges
one
after
the
other
but
not
one
face
met
his
with
even
the
consolation
of
mere
pity
the
torches
flickering
in
the
wind
lent
them
on
the
contrary
a
savage
and
terrible
expression
then
at
last
he
mingled
his
voice
with
the
voices
that
were
praying
for
him
the
judges
allowed
him
time
to
follow
the
funeral
prayer
to
its
close
in
the
meantime
others
were
preparing
a
pile
of
wood
oh
cried
the
priest
beholding
these
preparations
with
growing
terror
would
you
have
the
cruelty
to
kill
me
thus
no
replied
his
inflexible
accuser
flames
are
the
death
of
martyrs
you
are
not
worthy
of
such
a
death
apostate
the
hour
has
come
oh
my
god
my
god
cried
the
priest
raising
his
arms
to
heaven
stand
up
said
the
chouan
the
priest
tried
to
obey
but
his
strength
failed
him
and
he
fell
again
to
his
knees
will
you
let
that
murder
be
done
before
your
eyes
roland
asked
cadoudal
i
said
that
i
washed
my
hands
of
it
replied
the
latter
pilate
said
that
and
pilate
s
hands
are
to
this
day
red
with
the
blood
of
jesus
because
jesus
christ
was
a
righteous
man
this
man
is
a
kiss
your
cross
kiss
your
cross
cried
the
prelate
looked
at
him
with
a
terrified
air
but
without
obeying
it
was
evident
that
he
no
longer
saw
no
longer
heard
oh
cried
roland
making
an
effort
to
dismount
it
shall
never
be
said
that
i
let
a
man
be
murdered
before
me
and
did
not
try
to
save
a
threatening
murmur
rose
around
him
his
words
had
been
overheard
that
was
all
that
was
needed
to
excite
the
young
man
ah
is
that
the
way
of
it
he
cried
carrying
his
hand
to
one
of
his
holsters
but
with
a
movement
rapid
as
thought
cadoudal
seized
his
hand
and
while
roland
struggled
vainly
to
free
himself
from
this
grip
of
iron
he
shouted
fire
twenty
shots
resounded
instantly
and
the
bishop
fell
an
inert
mass
ah
cried
roland
what
have
you
done
forced
you
to
keep
your
promise
replied
cadoudal
you
swore
to
see
all
and
hear
all
without
offering
any
so
perish
all
enemies
of
god
and
the
king
said
in
a
solemn
voice
amen
responded
the
spectators
with
one
voice
of
sinister
unanimity
then
they
stripped
the
body
of
its
sacerdotal
ornaments
which
they
flung
upon
the
pile
of
wood
invited
the
other
travellers
to
take
their
places
in
the
diligence
replaced
the
postilion
in
his
saddle
and
opening
their
ranks
to
give
passage
to
the
coach
cried
go
with
god
the
diligence
rolled
rapidly
away
come
let
us
go
cried
cadoudal
we
have
still
twelve
miles
to
do
and
we
have
lost
an
hour
then
addressing
the
executioners
he
said
that
man
was
guilty
that
man
is
punished
human
justice
and
divine
justice
are
satisfied
let
prayers
for
the
dead
be
said
over
his
body
and
give
him
christian
burial
do
you
hear
and
sure
of
being
obeyed
cadoudal
put
his
horse
to
a
gallop
roland
seemed
to
hesitate
for
a
moment
whether
to
follow
him
or
not
then
as
if
resolving
to
accomplish
a
duty
he
said
i
will
go
to
the
spurring
his
horse
in
the
direction
taken
by
cadoudal
he
reached
the
chouan
leader
in
a
few
strides
both
disappeared
in
the
darkness
which
grew
thicker
and
thicker
as
the
men
left
the
place
where
the
torches
were
illuminating
the
dead
priest
s
face
and
the
fire
was
consuming
his
vestments
chapter
xxxiv
the
diplomacy
of
georges
cadoudal
the
feeling
that
roland
experienced
as
he
followed
georges
cadoudal
resembled
that
of
a
man
who
is
still
under
the
influence
of
a
dream
and
returns
gradually
from
the
confines
which
separate
night
from
day
he
strives
to
discover
whether
the
ground
he
walks
on
is
that
of
fiction
or
reality
and
the
more
he
burrows
in
the
dimness
of
his
brain
the
further
he
buries
himself
in
doubt
a
man
existed
for
whom
roland
felt
a
worship
almost
divine
accustomed
to
live
in
the
atmosphere
of
glory
which
surrounded
that
man
to
see
others
obey
his
orders
and
to
obey
them
himself
with
a
promptness
and
abnegation
that
were
almost
oriental
it
seemed
amazing
to
him
to
encounter
at
the
opposite
ends
of
france
two
organized
powers
enemies
of
the
power
of
that
man
and
prepared
to
struggle
against
it
suppose
a
jew
of
judas
maccabeus
a
worshipper
of
jehovah
having
from
his
infancy
heard
him
called
the
king
of
kings
the
god
of
strength
of
vengeance
of
armies
the
eternal
coming
suddenly
face
to
face
with
the
mysterious
osiris
of
the
egyptians
or
the
thundering
jupiter
of
the
greeks
his
adventures
at
avignon
and
bourg
with
morgan
and
the
company
of
jehu
his
adventures
in
the
villages
of
muzillac
and
the
trinité
with
cadoudal
and
his
chouans
seemed
to
him
some
strange
initiation
in
an
unknown
religion
but
like
those
courageous
neophytes
who
risk
death
to
learn
the
secrets
of
initiation
he
resolved
to
follow
to
the
end
besides
he
was
not
without
a
certain
admiration
for
these
exceptional
characters
nor
did
he
measure
without
a
certain
amazement
these
revolted
titans
challenging
his
god
he
felt
they
were
in
no
sense
common
men
neither
those
who
had
stabbed
sir
john
in
the
chartreuse
of
seillon
nor
those
who
had
shot
the
bishop
of
vannes
at
the
village
of
the
trinité
and
now
what
was
he
to
see
he
was
soon
to
know
for
they
had
ridden
five
hours
and
a
half
and
the
day
was
breaking
beyond
the
village
of
tridon
they
turned
across
country
leaving
vannes
to
the
left
they
reached
tréfléon
at
tréfléon
cadoudal
still
followed
by
his
or
had
found
assaut
and
he
gave
them
further
orders
and
continued
on
his
way
bearing
to
the
left
and
skirting
the
edges
of
a
little
wood
which
lies
between
grandchamp
and
larré
there
cadoudal
halted
imitated
three
separate
times
in
succession
the
cry
of
an
owl
and
was
presently
surrounded
by
his
three
hundred
men
a
grayish
light
was
spreading
through
the
sky
beyond
tréfléon
and
it
was
not
the
rising
of
the
sun
but
the
first
rays
of
dawn
a
heavy
mist
rose
from
the
earth
and
prevented
the
eye
from
seeing
more
than
fifty
feet
beyond
it
cadoudal
seemed
to
be
expecting
news
before
risking
himself
further
suddenly
about
five
hundred
paces
distant
the
crowing
of
a
cock
was
heard
cadoudal
pricked
up
his
ears
his
men
looked
at
each
other
and
laughed
the
cock
crowed
again
but
nearer
it
is
he
said
cadoudal
answer
the
howling
of
a
dog
came
from
within
three
feet
of
roland
but
so
perfectly
imitated
that
the
young
man
although
aware
of
what
it
was
looked
about
him
for
the
animal
that
was
uttering
such
lugubrious
plaints
almost
at
the
same
moment
he
saw
a
man
coming
rapidly
through
the
mist
his
form
growing
more
and
more
distinct
as
he
approached
the
saw
the
two
horsemen
and
went
toward
them
cadoudal
rode
forward
a
few
paces
putting
his
finger
to
his
lips
as
if
to
request
the
man
to
speak
low
the
latter
therefore
did
not
pause
until
he
was
close
beside
his
general
well
épine
asked
georges
have
we
got
them
like
a
mouse
in
a
trap
not
one
can
vannes
if
you
say
the
i
desire
nothing
better
how
many
are
there
one
hundred
men
commanded
by
the
general
how
many
wagons
when
did
they
start
they
must
be
about
a
mile
and
from
what
road
have
they
taken
grandchamp
to
so
that
if
i
deploy
from
meucon
to
plescop
you
ll
bar
the
that
s
cadoudal
called
his
four
lieutenants
assaut
air
and
la
giberne
to
him
gave
each
of
them
fifty
men
and
each
with
his
men
disappeared
like
shadows
in
the
heavy
mist
giving
the
hoot
as
they
vanished
cadoudal
was
left
with
a
hundred
men
or
and
épine
he
returned
to
roland
well
general
said
the
latter
is
everything
satisfactory
yes
colonel
fairly
so
replied
the
chouan
but
you
can
judge
for
yourself
in
half
an
it
will
be
difficult
to
judge
of
anything
in
that
cadoudal
looked
about
him
it
will
lift
in
half
an
hour
said
he
will
you
utilize
the
time
by
eating
a
mouthful
and
drinking
a
glass
faith
said
the
young
man
i
must
admit
that
the
ride
has
hollowed
i
make
a
point
said
georges
of
eating
the
best
breakfast
i
can
before
then
you
are
going
to
fight
i
think
against
whom
why
the
republicans
and
as
we
have
to
do
with
general
hatry
i
doubt
if
he
surrenders
without
do
the
republicans
know
they
are
going
to
fight
you
they
haven
t
the
least
so
it
is
to
be
a
surprise
not
exactly
inasmuch
as
when
the
fog
lifts
they
will
see
us
as
soon
as
we
see
then
turning
to
the
man
who
seemed
to
be
in
charge
of
the
provisions
cadoudal
added
is
there
anything
for
breakfast
nodded
affirmatively
went
into
the
wood
and
came
out
dragging
after
him
a
donkey
loaded
with
two
baskets
he
spread
a
cloak
on
a
rise
of
the
ground
and
placed
on
it
a
roast
chicken
a
bit
of
cold
salt
pork
some
bread
and
buckwheat
cakes
this
time
had
provided
luxury
in
the
shape
of
a
bottle
of
wine
and
a
glass
cadoudal
motioned
roland
to
the
table
and
the
improvised
repast
the
young
man
sprang
from
his
horse
throwing
the
bridle
to
a
chouan
cadoudal
did
likewise
now
said
the
latter
turning
to
his
men
you
have
half
an
hour
to
do
as
we
do
those
who
have
not
breakfasted
in
half
an
hour
are
notified
that
they
must
fight
on
empty
the
invitation
seemed
equivalent
to
an
order
so
promptly
and
precisely
was
it
executed
every
man
pulled
from
his
bag
or
his
pocket
a
bit
of
bread
or
a
buckwheat
cake
and
followed
the
example
of
his
general
who
had
already
divided
the
chicken
between
roland
and
himself
as
there
was
but
one
glass
both
officers
shared
it
while
they
were
thus
breakfasting
side
by
side
like
two
friends
on
a
hunt
the
sun
rose
and
as
cadoudal
had
predicted
the
mist
became
less
and
less
dense
soon
the
nearest
trees
could
be
distinguished
then
the
line
of
the
woods
stretching
to
the
right
from
meucon
to
while
to
the
left
the
plain
of
plescop
threaded
by
a
rivulet
sloped
gradually
toward
vannes
this
natural
declivity
of
the
ground
became
more
and
more
perceptible
as
it
neared
the
ocean
on
the
road
from
grandchamp
to
plescop
a
line
of
wagons
were
now
visible
the
tail
of
which
was
still
hidden
in
the
woods
this
line
was
motionless
evidently
some
unforeseen
obstacle
had
stopped
it
in
fact
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
before
the
leading
wagon
they
perceived
the
two
hundred
chouans
under
assaut
air
and
giberne
barring
the
way
the
republicans
inferior
in
number
we
said
that
there
were
but
a
hundred
had
halted
and
were
awaiting
the
complete
dispersion
of
the
fog
to
determine
the
number
and
character
of
the
men
they
were
about
to
meet
men
and
wagons
were
now
in
a
triangle
of
which
cadoudal
and
his
hundred
men
formed
one
of
the
angles
at
sight
of
this
small
number
of
men
thus
surrounded
by
triple
forces
and
of
the
uniform
of
which
the
color
had
given
its
name
to
the
republican
forces
roland
sprang
hastily
to
his
feet
as
for
cadoudal
he
remained
where
he
was
nonchalantly
finishing
his
meal
of
the
hundred
men
surrounding
the
general
not
one
seemed
to
perceive
the
spectacle
that
was
now
before
their
eyes
it
seemed
almost
as
if
they
were
waiting
for
cadoudal
s
order
to
look
at
it
roland
had
only
to
cast
his
eyes
on
the
republicans
to
see
that
they
were
lost
cadoudal
watched
the
various
emotions
that
succeeded
each
other
on
the
young
man
s
face
well
asked
the
chouan
after
a
moment
s
silence
do
you
think
my
dispositions
well
taken
you
might
better
say
your
precautions
general
replied
roland
with
a
sarcastic
smile
isn
t
it
the
first
consul
s
way
to
make
the
most
of
his
advantages
when
he
gets
them
asked
cadoudal
roland
bit
his
lips
then
instead
of
replying
to
the
royalist
leader
s
question
he
said
general
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
which
i
hope
you
will
not
what
is
it
permission
to
let
me
go
and
be
killed
with
my
cadoudal
rose
i
expected
that
request
he
said
then
you
will
grant
it
cried
roland
his
eyes
sparkling
with
joy
yes
but
first
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
you
said
the
royalist
leader
with
supreme
dignity
ask
it
to
bear
my
flag
of
truce
to
general
for
what
purpose
i
have
several
proposals
to
make
to
him
before
the
fight
i
presume
that
among
those
proposals
which
you
deign
to
intrust
to
me
you
do
not
include
that
of
laying
down
his
arms
on
the
contrary
colonel
you
understand
that
that
is
the
first
of
my
general
hatry
will
refuse
that
is
and
then
then
i
shall
give
him
his
choice
between
two
others
either
of
which
he
can
i
think
accept
without
forfeiting
his
what
are
they
i
will
tell
you
in
due
time
begin
with
the
state
general
hatry
and
his
hundred
men
are
surrounded
by
a
triple
force
i
offer
them
their
lives
but
they
must
lay
down
their
arms
and
make
oath
not
to
serve
again
in
the
vendée
for
five
roland
shook
his
head
better
that
than
to
see
his
men
maybe
so
but
he
would
prefer
to
have
his
men
annihilated
and
be
annihilated
with
don
t
you
think
asked
cadoudal
laughing
that
it
might
be
as
well
in
any
case
to
ask
him
true
said
roland
well
colonel
be
so
good
as
to
mount
your
horse
make
yourself
known
to
him
and
deliver
my
very
well
replied
roland
the
colonel
s
horse
said
cadoudal
motioning
to
the
chouan
who
was
watching
it
the
man
led
it
up
the
young
man
sprang
upon
it
and
rapidly
covered
the
distance
which
separated
him
from
the
convoy
a
group
of
men
were
gathered
on
its
flank
evidently
composed
of
general
hatry
and
his
officers
roland
rode
toward
them
scarcely
three
gunshots
distant
from
the
chouans
general
hatry
s
astonishment
was
great
when
he
saw
an
officer
in
the
republican
uniform
approaching
him
he
left
the
group
and
advanced
three
paces
to
meet
the
messenger
roland
made
himself
known
related
how
he
came
to
be
among
the
whites
and
transmitted
cadoudal
s
proposal
to
general
hatry
as
he
has
foreseen
the
latter
refused
it
roland
returned
to
cadoudal
with
a
proud
and
joyful
heart
he
refuses
he
cried
as
soon
as
his
voice
could
be
heard
cadoudal
gave
a
nod
that
showed
he
was
not
surprised
by
the
refusal
then
in
that
case
he
answered
go
back
with
my
second
proposition
i
don
t
wish
to
have
anything
to
reproach
myself
with
in
answering
to
such
a
judge
of
honor
as
roland
bowed
what
is
the
second
proposition
general
hatry
shall
meet
me
in
the
space
that
separates
the
two
troops
he
shall
carry
the
same
arms
as
i
that
is
his
sabre
and
pistols
and
the
matter
shall
be
decided
between
us
if
i
kill
him
his
men
are
to
submit
to
the
conditions
already
named
for
we
can
not
take
prisoners
if
he
kills
me
his
men
shall
pass
free
and
be
allowed
to
reach
vannes
safely
come
i
hope
that
s
a
proposition
you
would
accept
colonel
i
would
accept
it
myself
replied
roland
yes
exclaimed
cadoudal
but
you
are
not
general
hatry
content
yourself
with
being
a
negotiator
this
time
and
if
this
proposition
which
if
i
were
he
i
wouldn
t
let
escape
me
does
not
please
him
come
to
me
i
m
a
good
fellow
and
i
ll
make
him
a
roland
rode
off
a
second
time
his
coming
was
awaited
by
the
republicans
with
visible
impatience
he
transmitted
the
message
to
general
hatry
citizen
replied
the
general
i
must
render
account
of
my
conduct
to
the
first
consul
you
are
his
and
i
charge
you
on
your
return
to
paris
to
bear
testimony
on
my
behalf
to
him
what
would
you
do
in
my
place
whatever
you
would
do
that
i
shall
roland
started
his
face
assumed
the
grave
expression
of
a
man
who
is
arguing
a
point
of
honor
in
his
own
mind
then
at
the
end
of
a
few
seconds
he
said
general
i
should
your
reasons
citizen
demanded
the
general
the
chances
of
a
duel
are
problematic
you
can
not
subject
the
fate
of
a
hundred
brave
men
to
a
doubtful
chance
in
an
affair
like
this
where
all
are
concerned
every
man
had
better
defend
his
own
skin
as
best
he
is
that
your
opinion
colonel
on
my
it
is
also
mine
carry
my
reply
to
the
royalist
roland
galloped
back
to
cadoudal
and
delivered
general
hatry
s
reply
cadoudal
smiled
i
expected
it
he
said
you
couldn
t
have
expected
it
because
it
was
i
who
advised
him
to
make
you
thought
differently
a
few
moments
yes
but
you
yourself
reminded
me
that
i
was
not
general
hatry
come
what
is
your
third
proposition
said
roland
impatiently
for
he
began
to
perceive
or
rather
he
had
perceived
from
the
beginning
that
the
noble
part
in
the
affair
belonged
to
the
royalist
general
my
third
proposition
said
cadoudal
is
not
a
proposition
but
an
order
an
order
for
two
hundred
of
my
men
to
withdraw
general
hatry
has
one
hundred
men
i
will
keep
one
hundred
my
breton
forefathers
were
accustomed
to
fight
foot
to
foot
breast
to
breast
man
to
man
and
oftener
one
to
three
than
three
to
one
if
general
hatry
is
victorious
he
can
walk
over
our
bodies
and
tranquilly
enter
vannes
if
he
is
defeated
he
can
not
say
it
is
by
numbers
go
monsieur
de
montrevel
and
remain
with
your
friends
i
give
them
thus
the
advantage
of
numbers
for
you
alone
are
worth
ten
roland
raised
his
hat
what
are
you
doing
sir
demanded
cadoudal
i
always
bow
to
that
which
is
grand
general
i
bow
to
come
colonel
said
cadoudal
a
last
glass
of
wine
let
each
of
us
drink
to
what
we
love
best
to
that
which
we
grieve
to
leave
behind
to
that
we
hope
to
meet
in
taking
the
bottle
and
the
one
glass
he
filled
it
half
full
and
offered
it
to
roland
we
have
but
one
glass
monsieur
de
montrevel
drink
why
first
because
in
the
first
place
you
are
my
guest
and
also
because
there
is
a
proverb
that
whoever
drinks
after
another
knows
his
then
he
added
laughing
i
want
to
know
your
thought
monsieur
de
roland
emptied
the
glass
and
returned
it
to
cadoudal
the
latter
filled
his
glass
half
full
as
he
had
done
for
roland
and
emptied
it
in
turn
well
asked
roland
now
do
you
know
my
thought
general
my
thought
said
roland
with
his
usual
frankness
is
that
you
are
a
brave
man
general
i
shall
feel
honored
if
at
this
moment
when
we
are
going
to
fight
against
each
other
you
will
give
me
your
the
two
young
men
clasped
hands
more
like
friends
parting
for
a
long
absence
than
two
enemies
about
to
meet
on
the
battlefield
there
was
a
simple
grandeur
full
of
majesty
in
this
action
each
raised
his
hat
good
luck
said
roland
to
cadoudal
but
allow
me
to
doubt
it
i
must
even
confess
that
it
is
from
my
lips
not
my
god
keep
you
sir
said
cadoudal
and
i
hope
that
my
wish
will
be
realized
it
is
the
honest
expression
of
my
what
is
to
be
the
signal
that
you
are
ready
inquired
roland
a
musket
shot
fired
in
the
air
to
which
you
will
reply
in
the
same
very
good
general
replied
roland
and
putting
his
horse
to
a
gallop
he
crossed
the
space
between
the
royalist
general
and
the
republican
general
for
the
third
time
friends
said
cadoudal
pointing
to
roland
do
you
see
that
young
man
all
eyes
were
bent
upon
roland
yes
came
from
every
mouth
he
came
with
a
from
our
brothers
in
the
midi
his
life
is
sacred
to
you
he
may
be
captured
but
it
must
be
living
not
a
hair
of
his
head
must
be
very
good
general
replied
the
chouans
and
now
my
friends
remember
that
you
are
the
sons
of
those
thirty
bretons
who
fought
the
thirty
british
between
ploermel
and
josselin
ten
leagues
from
here
and
conquered
then
in
a
low
voice
he
added
with
a
sigh
unhappily
we
have
not
to
do
with
the
british
this
the
fog
had
now
lifted
completely
and
as
usually
happens
a
few
rays
of
the
wintry
sun
tinged
the
plain
of
plescop
with
a
yellow
light
it
was
easy
therefore
to
distinguish
the
movements
of
the
two
troops
while
roland
was
returning
to
the
republicans
or
galloped
toward
the
two
hundred
men
who
were
blocking
the
way
he
had
hardly
spoken
to
cadoudal
s
four
lieutenants
before
a
hundred
men
were
seen
to
wheel
to
the
right
and
a
hundred
more
to
wheel
to
the
left
and
march
in
opposite
directions
one
toward
plumergat
the
other
toward
leaving
the
road
open
each
body
halted
of
a
mile
down
the
road
grounded
arms
and
remained
motionless
or
returned
to
cadoudal
have
you
any
special
orders
to
give
me
general
he
asked
yes
one
answered
cadoudal
take
eight
men
and
follow
me
when
you
see
the
young
republican
with
whom
i
breakfasted
fall
under
his
horse
fling
yourself
upon
him
you
and
your
eight
men
before
he
has
time
to
free
himself
and
take
him
yes
you
know
that
i
must
have
him
safe
and
that
s
understood
general
choose
your
eight
men
monsieur
de
montrevel
once
captured
and
his
parole
given
you
can
do
as
you
suppose
he
won
t
give
his
parole
then
you
must
surround
him
so
that
he
can
t
escape
and
watch
him
till
the
fight
is
very
well
said
or
heaving
a
sigh
but
it
ll
be
a
little
hard
to
stand
by
with
folded
arms
while
the
others
are
having
their
pooh
who
knows
said
cadoudal
there
ll
probably
be
enough
for
every
then
casting
a
glance
over
the
plain
and
seeing
his
own
men
stationed
apart
and
the
republicans
massed
for
battle
he
cried
a
musket
they
brought
one
cadoudal
raised
it
above
his
head
and
fired
in
the
air
almost
at
the
same
moment
a
shot
fired
in
the
same
manner
from
the
midst
of
the
republicans
answered
like
an
echo
to
that
of
cadoudal
two
drums
beating
the
advance
and
a
bugle
were
heard
cadoudal
rose
in
his
stirrups
children
he
cried
have
you
all
said
your
morning
prayers
yes
yes
answered
almost
every
voice
if
any
of
you
forgot
them
or
did
not
have
time
let
them
pray
five
or
six
peasants
knelt
down
and
prayed
the
drums
and
bugle
drew
nearer
general
general
cried
several
voices
impatiently
they
are
the
general
motioned
to
the
kneeling
peasants
true
replied
the
impatient
ones
those
who
prayed
rose
one
by
one
according
as
their
prayers
had
been
long
or
short
by
the
time
they
were
all
afoot
the
republicans
had
crossed
nearly
of
the
distance
they
marched
bayonets
fixed
in
three
ranks
each
rank
three
abreast
roland
rode
at
the
head
of
the
first
rank
general
hatry
between
the
first
and
second
both
were
easily
recognized
being
the
only
men
on
horseback
among
the
chouans
cadoudal
was
the
only
rider
or
having
dismounted
to
take
command
of
the
eight
men
who
were
to
follow
georges
general
said
a
voice
the
prayer
is
ended
and
every
one
is
cadoudal
looked
around
him
to
make
sure
it
was
true
then
he
cried
in
a
loud
voice
forward
enjoy
yourselves
my
lads
this
permission
which
to
vendéans
and
chouans
was
equivalent
to
sounding
a
charge
was
scarcely
given
before
the
chouans
spread
over
the
fields
to
cries
of
vive
le
roi
waving
their
hats
with
one
hand
and
their
guns
with
the
other
instead
of
keeping
in
rank
like
the
republicans
they
scattered
like
sharpshooters
forming
an
immense
crescent
of
which
georges
and
his
horse
were
the
centre
a
moment
later
the
republicans
were
flanked
and
the
firing
began
cadoudal
s
men
were
nearly
all
poachers
that
is
to
say
excellent
marksmen
armed
with
english
carbines
able
to
carry
twice
the
length
of
the
army
musket
though
the
first
shots
fired
might
have
seemed
wide
of
range
these
messengers
of
death
nevertheless
brought
down
several
men
in
the
republican
ranks
forward
cried
the
general
the
soldiers
marched
on
bayonets
fixed
but
in
a
few
moments
there
was
no
enemy
before
them
cadoudal
s
hundred
men
had
turned
skirmishers
they
had
separated
and
fifty
men
were
harassing
both
of
the
enemy
s
flanks
general
hatry
ordered
his
men
to
wheel
to
the
right
and
left
then
came
the
order
fire
two
volleys
followed
with
the
precision
and
unanimity
of
well
disciplined
troops
but
they
were
almost
without
result
for
the
republicans
were
firing
upon
scattered
men
not
so
with
the
chouans
who
fired
on
a
mass
with
them
every
shot
told
roland
saw
the
disadvantage
of
the
position
he
looked
around
and
amid
the
smoke
distinguished
cadoudal
erect
and
motionless
as
an
equestrian
statue
he
understood
that
the
royalist
leader
was
waiting
for
him
with
a
cry
he
spurred
his
horse
toward
him
as
if
to
save
him
part
of
the
way
cadoudal
put
his
horse
to
a
gallop
but
a
hundred
feet
from
cadoudal
he
drew
rein
attention
he
said
to
or
and
his
companions
don
t
be
alarmed
general
here
we
are
said
or
cadoudal
drew
a
pistol
from
his
holster
and
cocked
it
roland
sabre
in
hand
was
charging
crouched
on
his
horse
s
neck
when
they
were
twenty
paces
apart
cadoudal
slowly
raised
his
hand
in
roland
s
direction
at
ten
paces
he
fired
the
horse
roland
was
riding
had
a
white
star
on
its
forehead
the
ball
struck
the
centre
of
that
star
and
the
horse
mortally
wounded
rolled
over
with
its
rider
at
cadoudal
s
feet
cadoudal
put
spurs
to
his
own
horse
and
jumped
both
horse
and
rider
or
and
his
men
were
ready
they
sprang
like
a
pack
of
jaguars
upon
roland
entangled
under
the
body
of
his
horse
the
young
man
dropped
his
sword
and
tried
to
seize
his
pistols
but
before
he
could
lay
hand
upon
the
holsters
two
men
had
him
by
the
arms
while
the
four
others
dragged
his
horse
from
between
his
legs
the
thing
was
done
with
such
unanimity
that
it
was
easy
to
see
the
manoeuvre
had
been
planned
roland
roared
with
rage
or
came
up
to
him
and
put
his
hat
in
his
hand
i
do
not
surrender
shouted
roland
useless
to
do
so
monsieur
de
montrevel
replied
or
with
the
utmost
politeness
what
do
you
mean
demanded
roland
exhausting
his
strength
in
a
struggle
as
desperate
as
it
was
useless
because
you
are
captured
it
was
so
true
that
there
could
be
no
answer
then
kill
me
cried
roland
we
don
t
want
to
kill
you
sir
replied
or
then
what
do
you
want
give
us
your
parole
not
to
fight
any
more
and
you
are
never
exclaimed
roland
excuse
me
monsieur
de
montrevel
said
or
but
that
is
not
loyal
what
shrieked
roland
in
a
fury
not
loyal
you
insult
me
villain
because
you
know
i
can
t
defend
myself
or
punish
i
am
not
a
villain
and
i
didn
t
insult
you
monsieur
de
montrevel
but
i
do
say
that
by
not
giving
your
word
you
deprive
the
general
of
nine
men
who
might
be
useful
to
him
and
who
are
obliged
to
stay
here
to
guard
you
that
s
not
the
way
the
big
round
head
acted
toward
you
he
had
two
hundred
men
more
than
you
and
he
sent
them
away
now
we
are
only
against
one
a
flame
crossed
roland
s
face
then
almost
as
suddenly
he
turned
pale
as
death
you
are
right
or
he
replied
succor
or
no
succor
i
surrender
you
and
your
men
can
go
and
fight
with
your
the
chouans
gave
a
cry
of
joy
let
go
their
hold
of
roland
and
rushed
toward
the
republicans
brandishing
their
hats
and
muskets
and
shouting
vive
le
roi
roland
freed
from
their
grip
but
disarmed
physically
by
his
fall
morally
by
his
parole
went
to
the
little
eminence
still
covered
by
the
cloak
which
had
served
as
a
tablecloth
for
their
breakfast
and
sat
down
from
there
he
could
see
the
whole
combat
not
a
detail
was
lost
upon
him
cadoudal
sat
erect
upon
his
horse
amid
fire
and
smoke
like
the
demon
of
war
invulnerable
and
implacable
here
and
there
the
bodies
of
a
dozen
or
more
chouans
lay
stretched
upon
the
sod
but
it
was
evident
that
the
republicans
still
massed
together
had
lost
double
that
number
wounded
men
dragged
themselves
across
the
open
space
meeting
rearing
their
bodies
like
mangled
snakes
to
fight
the
republicans
with
their
bayonets
and
the
chouans
with
their
knives
those
of
the
wounded
chouans
who
were
too
far
off
to
fight
their
wounded
enemies
hand
to
hand
reloaded
their
guns
and
struggling
to
their
knees
fired
and
fell
again
on
either
side
the
struggle
was
pitiless
incessant
furious
civil
war
that
is
war
without
mercy
or
compassion
waved
its
torch
above
the
battlefield
cadoudal
rode
his
horse
around
these
living
breastworks
firing
at
twenty
paces
sometimes
his
pistols
sometimes
a
musket
which
he
discharged
cast
aside
and
picked
up
again
reloaded
at
each
discharge
a
man
fell
the
third
time
he
made
this
round
general
hatry
honored
him
with
a
fusillade
he
disappeared
in
the
flame
and
smoke
and
roland
saw
him
go
down
he
and
his
horse
as
if
annihilated
ten
or
a
dozen
republicans
sprang
from
the
ranks
and
met
as
many
chouans
the
struggle
was
terrible
hand
to
hand
body
to
body
but
the
chouans
with
their
knives
were
sure
of
the
advantage
suddenly
cadoudal
appeared
erect
a
pistol
in
each
hand
it
was
the
death
of
two
men
two
men
fell
then
through
the
gap
left
by
these
ten
or
twelve
he
flung
himself
forward
with
thirty
men
he
had
picked
up
an
army
musket
and
using
it
like
a
club
he
brought
down
a
man
with
each
blow
he
broke
his
way
through
the
battalion
and
reappeared
at
the
other
side
then
like
a
boar
which
returns
upon
the
huntsman
he
has
ripped
up
and
trampled
he
rushed
back
through
the
gaping
wound
and
widened
it
from
that
moment
all
was
over
general
hatry
rallied
a
score
of
men
and
with
bayonets
down
they
fell
upon
the
circle
that
enveloped
them
he
marched
at
the
head
of
his
soldiers
on
foot
his
horse
had
been
killed
ten
men
had
fallen
before
the
circle
was
broken
but
at
last
he
was
beyond
it
the
chouans
wanted
to
pursue
them
but
cadoudal
in
a
voice
of
thunder
called
them
back
you
should
not
have
allowed
him
to
pass
he
cried
but
having
passed
he
is
free
to
the
chouans
obeyed
with
the
religious
faith
they
placed
in
the
words
of
their
chief
and
now
said
cadoudal
cease
firing
no
more
dead
make
the
chouans
drew
together
and
surrounded
the
heaps
of
dead
and
the
few
living
men
more
or
less
wounded
who
lay
among
the
dead
surrendering
was
still
fighting
in
this
fatal
war
where
on
both
sides
the
prisoners
were
shot
on
the
one
side
because
chouans
and
vendéans
were
considered
brigands
on
the
other
because
they
knew
not
where
to
put
the
captives
the
republicans
threw
their
guns
away
that
they
might
not
be
forced
to
surrender
them
when
their
captors
approached
them
every
was
open
every
man
had
fired
his
last
shot
cadoudal
walked
back
to
roland
during
the
whole
of
this
desperate
struggle
the
young
man
had
remained
on
the
mound
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
battle
his
hair
damp
with
sweat
his
breast
heaving
he
waited
for
the
result
then
when
he
saw
the
day
was
lost
his
head
fell
upon
his
hands
and
he
still
sat
on
his
forehead
bowed
to
the
earth
cadoudal
reached
him
before
he
seemed
to
hear
the
sound
of
footsteps
he
touched
the
young
man
s
shoulder
roland
raised
his
head
slowly
without
attempting
to
hide
the
two
great
tears
that
were
rolling
down
his
cheeks
general
said
roland
do
with
me
what
you
will
i
am
your
i
can
t
make
the
first
consul
s
ambassador
a
prisoner
replied
cadoudal
laughing
but
i
can
ask
him
to
do
me
a
command
me
i
need
a
hospital
for
the
wounded
and
a
prison
for
prisoners
will
you
take
the
republican
soldiers
wounded
and
prisoners
back
to
what
do
you
mean
general
exclaimed
roland
i
give
them
or
rather
i
confide
them
to
you
i
regret
that
your
horse
was
killed
so
is
mine
but
there
is
still
that
of
accept
the
young
man
made
a
motion
of
rejection
until
you
can
obtain
another
of
course
added
cadoudal
bowing
roland
felt
that
he
must
put
himself
at
least
in
simplicity
on
a
level
with
the
man
with
whom
he
was
dealing
shall
i
see
you
again
general
he
asked
rising
i
doubt
it
sir
my
operations
call
me
to
the
coast
near
your
duty
recalls
you
to
the
what
shall
i
tell
the
first
consul
general
what
you
have
seen
sir
he
must
judge
between
the
abbé
bernier
s
diplomacy
and
that
of
georges
after
what
i
have
seen
sir
i
doubt
if
you
ever
have
need
of
me
said
roland
but
in
any
case
remember
that
you
have
a
friend
near
the
first
and
he
held
out
his
hand
to
cadoudal
the
royalist
took
it
with
the
same
frankness
and
freedom
he
had
shown
before
the
battle
farewell
monsieur
de
montrevel
said
he
i
need
not
ask
you
to
justify
general
hatry
a
defeat
like
that
is
fully
as
glorious
as
a
during
this
time
s
horse
had
been
led
up
for
the
republican
colonel
he
sprang
into
the
saddle
by
the
bye
said
cadoudal
as
you
go
through
la
just
inquire
what
has
happened
to
citizen
thomas
he
is
dead
said
a
voice
and
his
four
men
covered
with
mud
and
sweat
had
just
arrived
but
too
late
for
the
battle
roland
cast
a
last
glance
at
the
battlefield
sighed
and
waving
a
last
farewell
to
cadoudal
started
at
a
gallop
across
the
fields
to
await
on
the
road
to
vannes
the
of
wounded
and
the
prisoners
he
was
asked
to
deliver
to
general
hatry
cadoudal
had
given
a
crown
of
six
sous
to
each
man
roland
could
not
help
reflecting
that
the
gift
was
made
with
the
money
of
the
directory
sent
to
the
west
by
morgan
and
the
companions
of
jehu
chapter
xxxv
a
proposal
of
marriage
roland
s
first
visit
on
arriving
in
paris
was
to
the
first
consul
he
brought
him
the
twofold
news
of
the
pacification
of
the
vendée
and
the
increasingly
bitter
insurrection
in
brittany
bonaparte
knew
roland
consequently
the
triple
narrative
of
thomas
millière
s
murder
the
execution
of
bishop
audrein
and
the
fight
at
grandchamp
produced
a
deep
impression
upon
him
there
was
moreover
in
the
young
man
s
manner
a
sombre
despair
in
which
he
could
not
be
mistaken
roland
was
miserable
over
this
lost
opportunity
to
get
himself
killed
an
unknown
power
seemed
to
watch
over
him
carrying
him
safe
and
sound
through
dangers
which
resulted
fatally
to
others
sir
john
had
found
twelve
judges
and
a
where
he
had
seen
but
a
phantom
invulnerable
it
is
true
but
inoffensive
he
blamed
himself
bitterly
for
singling
out
cadoudal
in
the
fight
thus
exposing
himself
to
a
plan
of
capture
instead
of
flinging
himself
into
the
fray
and
killing
or
being
killed
the
first
consul
watched
him
anxiously
as
he
talked
the
longing
for
death
still
lingered
in
his
mind
a
longing
he
hoped
to
cure
by
this
return
to
his
native
land
and
the
endearments
of
his
family
he
praised
and
defended
general
hatry
but
just
and
impartial
as
a
soldier
should
be
he
gave
full
credit
to
cadoudal
for
the
courage
and
generosity
the
royalist
general
had
displayed
bonaparte
listened
gravely
almost
sadly
ardent
as
he
was
for
foreign
war
with
its
glorious
halo
his
soul
revolted
at
the
internecine
strife
which
drained
the
of
the
nation
and
rent
its
bowels
it
was
a
case
in
which
to
his
thinking
negotiation
should
be
substituted
for
war
but
how
negotiate
with
a
man
like
cadoudal
bonaparte
was
not
unaware
of
his
own
personal
seductions
when
he
chose
to
exercise
them
he
resolved
to
see
cadoudal
and
without
saying
anything
on
the
subject
to
roland
he
intended
to
make
use
of
him
for
the
interview
when
the
time
came
in
the
meantime
he
wanted
to
see
if
brune
in
whose
talent
he
had
great
confidence
would
be
more
successful
than
his
predecessors
he
dismissed
roland
after
telling
him
of
his
mother
s
arrival
and
her
installation
in
the
little
house
in
the
rue
de
la
victoire
roland
sprang
into
a
coach
and
was
driven
there
at
once
he
found
madame
de
montrevel
as
happy
and
as
proud
as
a
woman
and
a
mother
could
be
edouard
had
gone
the
day
before
to
the
prytanée
français
and
she
herself
was
preparing
to
return
to
amélie
whose
health
continued
to
give
her
much
anxiety
as
for
sir
john
he
was
not
only
out
of
danger
but
almost
well
again
he
was
in
paris
had
called
upon
madame
de
montrevel
and
finding
that
she
had
gone
with
edouard
to
the
prytanée
he
had
left
his
card
it
bore
his
address
hôtel
mirabeau
rue
de
richelieu
it
was
eleven
o
clock
sir
john
s
breakfast
hour
and
roland
had
every
chance
of
finding
him
at
that
hour
he
got
back
into
his
carriage
and
ordered
the
coachman
to
stop
at
the
hôtel
mirabeau
he
found
sir
john
sitting
before
an
english
breakfast
a
thing
rarely
seen
in
those
days
drinking
large
cups
of
tea
and
eating
bloody
chops
as
soon
as
the
englishman
saw
roland
he
gave
a
cry
of
joy
and
ran
to
meet
him
roland
himself
had
acquired
a
deep
affection
for
that
exceptional
nature
where
the
noblest
qualities
of
the
heart
seemed
striving
to
hide
themselves
beneath
national
eccentricities
sir
john
was
pale
and
thin
but
in
other
respects
he
was
well
his
wound
had
completely
healed
and
except
for
a
slight
oppression
which
was
diminishing
daily
and
would
soon
disappear
altogether
he
had
almost
recovered
his
former
health
he
now
welcomed
roland
with
a
tenderness
scarcely
to
be
expected
from
that
reserved
nature
declaring
that
the
joy
he
felt
in
seeing
him
again
was
all
he
wanted
for
his
complete
recovery
he
begged
roland
to
share
the
meal
telling
him
to
order
his
own
breakfast
a
la
française
roland
accepted
like
all
soldiers
who
had
fought
the
hard
wars
of
the
revolution
when
bread
was
often
lacking
roland
cared
little
for
what
he
ate
he
had
acquired
the
habit
of
eating
whatever
was
put
before
him
as
a
precaution
against
the
days
when
there
might
be
nothing
at
all
sir
john
s
attention
in
asking
him
to
make
a
french
breakfast
was
scarcely
noticed
by
him
at
all
but
what
roland
did
notice
was
sir
john
s
preoccupation
of
mind
it
was
evident
that
sir
john
had
something
on
his
lips
which
he
hesitated
to
utter
roland
thought
he
had
better
help
him
so
when
breakfast
was
nearly
over
roland
with
his
usual
frankness
which
almost
bordered
upon
brutality
at
times
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
settled
his
chin
in
his
hands
and
said
well
my
dear
sir
john
you
have
something
to
say
to
your
friend
roland
that
you
don
t
dare
put
into
sir
john
started
and
from
pale
as
he
was
turned
crimson
confound
it
continued
roland
it
must
be
hard
to
get
out
but
sir
john
if
you
have
many
things
to
ask
me
i
know
but
few
that
i
have
the
right
to
refuse
you
so
go
on
i
am
and
roland
closed
his
eyes
as
if
to
concentrate
all
his
attention
on
what
sir
john
was
about
to
say
but
the
matter
was
evidently
from
sir
john
s
point
of
view
so
extremely
difficult
to
make
known
that
at
the
end
of
a
dozen
seconds
finding
that
sir
john
was
still
silent
roland
opened
his
eyes
the
englishman
was
pale
again
but
this
time
he
was
paler
than
before
roland
held
out
his
hand
to
him
why
he
said
i
see
you
want
to
make
some
compliment
about
the
way
you
were
treated
at
the
château
des
precisely
my
friend
for
the
happiness
or
misery
of
my
life
will
date
from
my
sojourn
at
the
roland
looked
fixedly
at
sir
john
the
deuce
he
exclaimed
can
i
be
so
fortunate
then
he
stopped
remembering
that
what
he
was
about
to
say
was
most
unconventional
from
the
social
point
of
view
oh
exclaimed
sir
john
my
dear
roland
finish
what
you
were
you
wish
it
i
implore
but
if
i
am
mistaken
if
i
should
say
something
my
friend
my
friend
go
well
as
i
was
saying
my
lord
can
i
be
so
fortunate
as
to
find
your
lordship
in
love
with
my
sister
sir
john
gave
a
cry
of
joy
and
with
a
rapid
movement
of
which
so
phlegmatic
a
man
might
have
been
thought
incapable
he
threw
himself
in
roland
s
arms
your
sister
is
an
angel
my
dear
roland
he
exclaimed
and
i
love
her
with
all
my
are
you
entirely
free
to
do
so
my
lord
entirely
for
the
last
twelve
years
as
i
told
you
i
have
had
my
fortune
under
my
own
control
it
amounts
to
thousand
pounds
sterling
a
too
much
my
dear
fellow
for
a
woman
who
can
only
bring
you
fifty
thousand
oh
said
the
englishman
with
that
national
accent
that
returned
to
him
occasionally
in
moments
of
strong
excitement
if
i
must
get
rid
of
a
part
of
it
i
can
do
no
replied
roland
laughing
that
s
not
necessary
you
re
rich
it
s
unfortunate
but
what
s
to
be
done
no
that
s
not
the
question
do
you
love
my
sister
i
adore
and
she
resumed
roland
does
she
love
you
of
course
you
understand
returned
sir
john
that
i
have
not
asked
her
i
was
bound
my
dear
roland
to
speak
to
you
first
and
if
the
matter
were
agreeable
to
beg
you
to
plead
my
cause
with
your
mother
after
i
have
obtained
the
consent
of
both
i
shall
make
my
offer
or
rather
you
will
make
it
for
me
for
i
should
never
then
i
am
the
first
to
receive
your
confidence
you
are
my
best
friend
and
it
ought
to
be
well
my
dear
friend
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
your
suit
is
won
your
mother
and
sister
they
will
be
one
you
understand
that
my
mother
will
leave
amélie
free
to
make
her
own
choice
and
i
need
not
tell
you
that
if
it
falls
upon
you
she
will
be
delighted
but
there
is
a
person
whom
you
have
who
is
that
said
sir
john
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
having
weighed
all
chances
for
and
against
believes
he
knows
them
all
and
is
met
by
an
obstacle
he
has
never
thought
of
the
first
consul
said
roland
god
ejaculated
the
englishman
swallowing
the
last
words
of
the
national
oath
he
spoke
to
me
just
before
i
left
for
the
vendée
of
my
sister
s
marriage
continued
roland
saying
that
it
no
longer
concerned
my
mother
and
myself
for
he
would
take
charge
of
then
said
sir
john
i
am
why
so
the
first
consul
does
not
like
the
say
rather
that
the
english
do
not
like
the
first
but
who
will
present
my
wishes
to
the
first
consul
i
and
will
you
speak
of
them
as
agreeable
to
yourself
i
ll
turn
you
into
a
dove
of
peace
between
the
two
nations
said
roland
rising
oh
thank
you
cried
sir
john
seizing
the
young
man
s
hand
then
he
added
regretfully
must
you
leave
me
my
friend
i
have

to
the
well
take
him
my
compliments
and
tell
him
i
have
ordered
another
pair
of
pistols
for
him
so
that
the
next
time
he
is
attacked
by
bandits
he
needn
t
use
the
conductor
roland
looked
at
sir
john

in
the
diligence

mother

in

attacked

seen
madame
de
montrevel
and
she
didn
t
tell
you
not
a
word
about
that
well
my
dear
edouard
proved
a
hero
as
no
one
else
defended
the
coach
he
did
he
took
the
conductor
s
pistols
and
brave
boy
exclaimed
roland
yes
but
unluckily
or
luckily
the
conductor
had
taken
the
precaution
to
remove
the
bullets
edouard
was
praised
and
petted
by
the
companions
of
jehu
as
the
bravest
of
the
brave
but
he
neither
killed
nor
wounded
are
you
sure
of
what
you
are
telling
me
i
tell
you
your
sister
almost
died
of
very
good
said
roland
how
very
good
exclaimed
sir
john
i
mean
all
the
more
reason
why
i
should
see
what
makes
you
say
a
tell
me
what
it
faith
no
my
plans
don
t
turn
out
well
for
but
you

my
dear
roland
that
if
there

any
reprisals

them
for

love

dear
fellow

your
you
promise
me

support

s
understood
i
am
most
anxious
to
call
you
are
you
tired
of
calling
me
friend
faith
yes
it
is
too
they
pressed
each
other
s
hands
and
parted
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
roland
reached
the
prytanée
français
which
stood
then
on
the
present
site
of
the
lyceum
of
that
is
to
say
at
the
head
of
the
rue
behind
the
sorbonne
at
the
first
words
of
the
director
roland
saw
that
his
young
brother
had
been
especially
recommended
to
the
authorities
the
boy
was
sent
for
edouard
flung
himself
into
the
arms
of
his
big
brother
with
that
passionate
adoration
he
had
for
him
after
the
first
embraces
were
over
roland
inquired
about
the
stoppage
of
the
diligence
madame
de
montrevel
had
been
chary
of
mentioning
it
sir
john
had
been
sober
in
statement
but
not
so
edouard
it
was
his
iliad
his
very
own
he
related
it
with
every
detail
jérôme
s
connivance
with
the
bandits
the
pistols
loaded
with
powder
only
his
mother
s
the
attention
paid
to
her
by
those
who
had
caused
it
his
own
name
known
to
the
bandits
the
fall
of
the
mask
from
the
face
of
the
one
who
was
restoring
his
mother
his
certainty
that
she
must
have
seen
the
man
s
face
roland
was
above
all
struck
with
this
last
particular
then
the
boy
related
their
audience
with
the
first
consul
and
told
how
the
latter
had
kissed
and
petted
him
and
finally
recommended
him
to
the
director
of
the
prytanée
français
roland
learned
from
the
child
all
that
he
wished
to
know
and
as
it
took
but
five
minutes
to
go
from
the
rue
saint
jacques
to
the
luxembourg
he
was
at
the
palace
in
that
time
chapter
xxxvi
sculpture
and
painting
when
roland
returned
to
the
luxembourg
the
clock
of
the
palace
marked
one
hour
and
a
quarter
after
the
first
consul
was
working
with
bourrienne
if
we
were
merely
writing
a
novel
we
should
hasten
to
its
close
and
in
order
to
get
there
more
expeditiously
we
should
neglect
certain
details
which
we
are
told
historical
figures
can
do
without
that
is
not
our
opinion
from
the
day
we
first
put
pen
to
paper
now
some
thirty
years
ago
whether
our
thought
were
concentrated
on
a
drama
or
whether
it
spread
itself
into
a
novel
we
have
had
a
double
end
to
instruct
and
to
amuse
and
we
say
instruct
first
for
amusement
has
never
been
to
our
mind
anything
but
a
mask
for
instruction
have
we
succeeded
we
think
so
before
long
we
shall
have
covered
with
our
narratives
an
enormous
period
of
time
between
the
comtesse
de
salisbury
and
the
comte
de
five
centuries
and
a
half
are
comprised
well
we
assert
that
we
have
taught
france
as
much
history
about
those
five
centuries
and
a
half
as
any
historian
more
than
that
although
our
opinions
are
well
known
although
under
the
bourbons
of
the
elder
branch
as
under
the
bourbons
of
the
younger
branch
under
the
republic
as
under
the
present
government
we
have
always
proclaimed
them
loudly
we
do
not
believe
that
that
opinion
has
been
unduly
manifested
in
our
books
and
dramas
we
admire
the
marquis
de
posa
in
schiller
s
don
carlos
but
in
his
stead
we
should
not
have
anticipated
the
spirit
of
that
age
to
the
point
of
placing
a
philosopher
of
the
eighteenth
century
among
the
heroes
of
the
sixteenth
an
encyclopedist
at
the
court
of
philippe
ii
therefore
just
as
we
have
been
in
literary
parlance
monarchical
under
the
monarchy
republican
under
the
republic
we
are
reconstructionists
under
the
consulate
that
does
not
prevent
our
thought
from
hovering
above
men
above
their
epoch
and
giving
to
each
the
share
of
good
and
evil
they
do
now
that
share
no
one
except
god
has
the
right
to
award
from
his
individual
point
of
view
the
kings
of
egypt
who
at
the
moment
they
passed
into
the
unknown
were
judged
upon
the
threshold
of
their
tombs
were
not
judged
by
a
man
but
by
a
people
that
is
why
it
is
said
the
judgment
of
a
people
is
the
judgment
of
historian
novelist
poet
dramatic
author
we
are
nothing
more
than
the
foreman
of
a
jury
who
impartially
sums
up
the
arguments
and
leaves
the
jury
to
give
their
verdict
the
book
is
the
summing
up
the
readers
are
the
jury
that
is
why
having
to
paint
one
of
the
most
gigantic
figures
not
only
of
modern
times
but
of
all
times
having
to
paint
the
period
of
his
transition
that
is
to
say
the
moment
when
bonaparte
transformed
himself
into
napoleon
the
general
into
an
emperor
that
is
why
we
say
in
the
fear
of
becoming
unjust
we
abandon
interpretations
and
substitute
facts
we
are
not
of
those
who
say
with
voltaire
that
no
one
is
a
hero
to
his
it
may
be
that
the
valet
is
or
envious
two
infirmities
that
resemble
each
other
more
closely
than
people
think
we
maintain
that
a
hero
may
become
a
kind
man
but
a
hero
for
being
kind
is
none
the
less
a
hero
what
is
a
hero
in
the
eyes
of
the
public
a
man
whose
genius
is
momentarily
greater
than
his
heart
what
is
a
hero
in
private
life
a
man
whose
heart
is
momentarily
greater
than
his
genius
historians
judge
the
genius
people
judge
the
heart
who
judged
charlemagne
the
historians
who
judged
henri
the
people
which
in
your
opinion
was
the
most
righteously
judged
well
in
order
to
render
just
judgment
and
compel
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
none
other
than
posterity
to
confirm
contemporaneous
judgments
it
is
essential
not
to
light
up
one
side
only
of
the
figure
we
depict
but
to
walk
around
it
and
wherever
the
sunlight
does
not
reach
to
hold
a
torch
or
even
a
candle
now
let
us
return
to
bonaparte
he
was
working
as
we
said
with
bourrienne
let
us
inquire
into
the
usual
division
of
the
first
consul
s
time
he
rose
at
seven
or
eight
in
the
morning
and
immediately
called
one
of
his
secretaries
preferably
bourrienne
and
worked
with
him
until
ten
at
ten
breakfast
was
announced
josephine
hortense
and
eugène
either
waited
or
sat
down
to
table
with
the
family
that
is
with
the
on
duty
and
bourrienne
after
breakfast
he
talked
with
the
usual
party
or
the
invited
guests
if
there
were
any
one
hour
was
devoted
to
this
intercourse
which
was
generally
shared
by
the
first
consul
s
two
brothers
lucien
and
joseph
regnault
de
angely
boulay
de
la
meurthe
monge
berthollet
laplace
and
arnault
toward
noon
cambacérès
arrived
as
a
general
thing
bonaparte
devoted
half
an
hour
to
his
chancellor
then
suddenly
without
warning
he
would
rise
and
say
au
revoir
josephine
au
revoir
hortense
come
bourrienne
let
us
go
to
this
speech
which
recurred
almost
regularly
in
the
same
words
was
no
sooner
uttered
than
bonaparte
left
the
salon
and
returned
to
his
study
there
no
system
of
work
was
adopted
it
might
be
some
urgent
matter
or
merely
a
caprice
either
bonaparte
dictated
or
bourrienne
read
after
which
the
first
consul
went
to
the
council
in
the
earlier
months
of
the
consulate
he
was
obliged
to
cross
the
courtyard
of
the
little
luxembourg
to
reach
the
which
if
the
weather
were
rainy
put
him
in
bad
humor
but
toward
the
end
of
december
he
had
the
courtyard
covered
and
from
that
time
he
almost
always
returned
to
his
study
singing
bonaparte
sang
almost
as
false
as
louis
xv
as
soon
as
he
was
back
he
examined
the
work
he
had
ordered
done
signed
his
letters
and
stretched
himself
out
in
his
armchair
the
arms
of
which
he
stabbed
with
his
penknife
as
he
talked
if
he
was
not
inclined
to
talk
he
reread
the
letters
of
the
day
before
or
the
pamphlets
of
the
day
laughing
at
intervals
with
the
hearty
laugh
of
a
great
child
then
suddenly
as
one
awakening
from
a
dream
he
would
spring
to
his
feet
and
cry
out
write
bourrienne
then
he
would
sketch
out
the
plan
for
some
building
to
be
erected
or
dictate
some
one
of
those
vast
projects
which
have
amazed
let
us
say
rather
terrified
the
world
at
five
o
clock
he
dined
after
dinner
the
first
consul
ascended
to
josephine
s
apartments
where
he
usually
received
the
visits
of
the
ministers
and
particularly
that
of
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
de
talleyrand
at
midnight
sometimes
earlier
but
never
later
he
gave
the
signal
for
retiring
by
saying
brusquely
let
us
go
to
the
next
day
at
seven
in
the
morning
the
same
life
began
over
again
varied
only
by
unforeseen
incidents
after
these
details
of
the
personal
habits
of
the
great
genius
we
are
trying
to
depict
under
his
first
aspect
his
personal
portrait
ought
we
think
to
come
bonaparte
first
consul
has
left
fewer
indications
of
his
personal
appearance
than
napoleon
emperor
now
as
nothing
less
resembles
the
emperor
of
than
the
first
consul
of
let
us
endeavor
if
possible
to
sketch
with
a
pen
those
features
which
the
brush
has
never
fully
portrayed
that
countenance
which
neither
bronze
nor
marble
has
been
able
to
render
most
of
the
painters
and
sculptors
who
flourished
during
this
illustrious
period
of
art
gros
david
prud
hon
girodet
and
bosio
have
endeavored
to
transmit
to
posterity
the
features
of
the
man
of
destiny
at
the
different
epochs
when
the
vast
providential
vistas
which
beckoned
him
first
revealed
themselves
thus
we
have
portraits
of
bonaparte
bonaparte
first
consul
and
napoleon
emperor
and
although
some
painters
and
sculptors
have
caught
more
or
less
successfully
the
type
of
his
face
it
may
be
said
that
there
does
not
exist
either
of
the
general
the
first
consul
or
the
emperor
a
single
portrait
or
bust
which
perfectly
resembles
him
it
was
not
within
the
power
of
even
genius
to
triumph
over
an
impossibility
during
the
first
part
of
bonaparte
s
life
it
was
possible
to
paint
or
chisel
bonaparte
s
protuberant
skull
his
brow
furrowed
by
the
sublime
line
of
thought
his
pale
elongated
face
his
granite
complexion
and
the
meditative
character
of
his
countenance
during
the
second
part
of
his
life
it
was
possible
to
paint
or
to
chisel
his
broadened
forehead
his
admirably
defined
eyebrows
his
straight
nose
his
lips
his
chin
modelled
with
rare
perfection
his
whole
face
in
short
like
a
coin
of
augustus
but
that
which
neither
his
bust
nor
his
portrait
could
render
which
was
utterly
beyond
the
domain
of
imitation
was
the
mobility
of
his
look
that
look
which
is
to
man
what
the
lightning
is
to
god
namely
the
proof
of
his
divinity
in
bonaparte
that
look
obeyed
his
will
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
in
one
and
the
same
minute
it
dared
from
beneath
his
eyelids
now
keen
and
piercing
as
the
blade
of
a
dagger
violently
unsheathed
now
soft
as
a
sun
ray
or
a
kiss
now
stern
as
a
challenge
or
terrible
as
a
threat
bonaparte
had
a
look
for
every
thought
that
stirred
his
soul
in
napoleon
this
look
except
in
the
momentous
circumstances
of
his
life
ceased
to
be
mobile
and
became
fixed
but
even
so
it
was
none
the
less
impossible
to
render
it
was
a
drill
sounding
the
heart
of
whosoever
he
looked
upon
the
deepest
the
most
secret
thought
of
which
he
meant
to
sound
marble
or
painting
might
render
the
fixedness
of
that
look
but
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
could
portray
its
life
that
is
to
say
its
penetrating
and
magnetic
action
troubled
hearts
have
veiled
eyes
bonaparte
even
in
the
days
of
his
leanness
had
beautiful
hands
and
he
displayed
them
with
a
certain
coquetry
as
he
grew
stouter
his
hands
became
superb
he
took
the
utmost
care
of
them
and
looked
at
them
when
talking
with
much
complacency
he
felt
the
same
satisfaction
in
his
teeth
which
were
handsome
though
not
with
the
splendor
of
his
hands
when
he
walked
either
alone
or
with
some
one
whether
in
a
room
or
in
a
garden
he
always
bent
a
little
forward
as
though
his
head
were
heavy
to
carry
and
crossed
his
hands
behind
his
back
he
frequently
made
an
involuntary
movement
with
the
right
shoulder
as
if
a
nervous
shudder
had
passed
through
it
and
at
the
same
time
his
mouth
made
a
curious
movement
from
right
to
left
which
seemed
to
result
from
the
other
these
movements
however
had
nothing
convulsive
about
them
whatever
may
have
been
said
notwithstanding
they
were
a
simple
trick
indicative
of
great
preoccupation
a
sort
of
congestion
of
the
mind
it
was
chiefly
manifested
when
the
general
the
first
consul
or
the
emperor
was
maturing
vast
plans
it
was
after
such
promenades
accompanied
by
this
twofold
movement
of
the
shoulders
and
lips
that
he
dictated
his
most
important
notes
on
a
campaign
with
the
army
on
horseback
he
was
indefatigable
he
was
almost
as
much
so
in
ordinary
life
and
would
often
walk
five
or
six
hours
in
succession
without
perceiving
it
when
he
walked
thus
with
some
one
with
whom
he
was
familiar
he
commonly
passed
his
arm
through
that
or
his
companion
and
leaned
upon
him
slender
and
thin
as
he
was
at
the
period
when
we
place
him
before
our
readers
eyes
he
was
much
concerned
by
the
fear
of
future
corpulence
it
was
to
bourrienne
that
he
usually
confided
this
singular
dread
you
see
bourrienne
how
slim
and
abstemious
i
am
well
nothing
can
rid
me
of
the
idea
that
when
i
am
forty
i
shall
be
a
great
eater
and
very
fat
i
foresee
that
my
constitution
will
undergo
a
change
i
take
exercise
enough
but
what
will
you
it
s
a
presentiment
and
it
won
t
fail
to
we
all
know
to
what
obesity
he
attained
when
a
prisoner
at
saint
helena
he
had
a
positive
passion
for
baths
which
no
doubt
contributed
not
a
little
to
make
him
fat
this
passion
became
an
irresistible
need
he
took
one
every
other
day
and
stayed
in
it
two
hours
during
which
time
the
journals
and
pamphlets
of
the
day
were
read
to
him
as
the
water
cooled
he
would
turn
the
faucet
until
he
raised
the
temperature
of
his
bathroom
to
such
a
degree
that
the
reader
could
neither
bear
it
any
longer
nor
see
to
read
not
until
then
would
he
permit
the
door
to
be
opened
it
has
been
said
that
he
was
subject
to
epileptic
attacks
after
his
first
campaign
in
italy
bourrienne
was
with
him
eleven
years
and
never
saw
him
suffer
from
an
attack
of
this
malady
bonaparte
though
indefatigable
when
necessity
demanded
it
required
much
sleep
especially
during
the
period
of
which
we
are
now
writing
bonaparte
general
or
first
consul
kept
others
awake
but
he
slept
and
slept
well
he
retired
at
midnight
sometimes
earlier
as
we
have
said
and
when
at
seven
in
the
morning
they
entered
his
room
to
awaken
him
he
was
always
asleep
usually
at
the
first
call
he
would
rise
but
occasionally
still
half
asleep
he
would
mutter
bourrienne
i
beg
of
you
let
me
sleep
a
little
then
if
there
was
nothing
urgent
bourrienne
would
return
at
eight
o
clock
if
it
was
otherwise
he
insisted
and
then
with
much
grumbling
bonaparte
would
get
up
he
slept
seven
sometimes
eight
hours
out
of
the
taking
a
short
nap
in
the
afternoon
he
also
gave
particular
instruction
for
the
night
at
night
he
would
say
come
in
my
room
as
seldom
as
possible
never
wake
me
if
you
have
good
news
to
announce
good
news
can
wait
but
if
there
is
bad
news
wake
me
instantly
for
then
there
is
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
in
facing
as
soon
as
bonaparte
had
risen
and
made
his
morning
ablutions
which
were
very
thorough
his
valet
entered
and
brushed
his
hair
and
shaved
him
while
he
was
being
shaved
a
secretary
or
an
read
the
newspapers
aloud
always
beginning
with
the
he
gave
no
real
attention
to
any
but
the
english
and
german
papers
skip
that
he
would
say
when
they
read
him
the
french
papers
know
what
they
say
because
they
only
say
what
i
his
toilet
completed
bonaparte
went
down
to
his
study
we
have
seen
above
what
he
did
there
at
ten
o
clock
the
breakfast
as
announced
usually
by
the
steward
in
these
words
the
general
is
no
title
it
will
be
observed
not
even
that
of
first
consul
the
repast
was
a
frugal
one
every
morning
a
dish
was
served
which
bonaparte
particularly
liked
a
chicken
fried
in
oil
with
garlic
the
same
dish
that
is
now
called
on
the
bills
of
fare
at
restaurants
chicken
à
la
bonaparte
drank
little
and
then
only
bordeaux
or
burgundy
preferably
the
latter
after
breakfast
as
after
dinner
he
drank
a
cup
of
black
coffee
never
between
meals
when
he
chanced
to
work
until
late
at
night
they
brought
him
not
coffee
but
chocolate
and
the
secretary
who
worked
with
him
had
a
cup
of
the
same
most
historians
narrators
and
biographers
after
saying
that
bonaparte
drank
a
great
deal
of
coffee
add
that
he
took
snuff
to
excess
they
are
doubly
mistaken
from
the
time
he
was
bonaparte
had
contracted
the
habit
of
taking
snuff
but
only
enough
to
keep
his
brain
awake
he
took
it
habitually
not
as
biographers
have
declared
from
the
pocket
of
his
waistcoat
but
from
a
which
he
changed
almost
every
day
for
a
new
one
having
in
this
matter
of
collecting
a
certain
resemblance
to
the
great
frederick
if
he
ever
did
take
snuff
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
it
was
on
his
battle
days
when
it
would
have
been
difficult
while
riding
at
a
gallop
under
fire
to
hold
both
reins
and
for
those
days
he
had
special
waistcoats
with
the
pocket
lined
with
perfumed
leather
and
as
the
sloping
cut
of
his
coat
enabled
him
to
insert
his
thumb
and
forefinger
into
this
pocket
without
unbuttoning
his
coat
he
could
under
any
circumstances
and
at
any
gait
take
snuff
when
he
pleased
as
general
or
first
consul
he
never
wore
gloves
contenting
himself
with
holding
and
crumpling
them
in
his
left
hand
as
emperor
there
was
some
advance
in
this
propriety
he
wore
one
glove
and
as
he
changed
his
gloves
not
once
but
two
or
three
times
a
day
his
valet
adopted
the
habit
of
giving
him
alternate
gloves
thus
making
one
pair
serve
as
two
bonaparte
had
two
great
passions
which
napoleon
inherited
for
war
and
architectural
monuments
to
his
fame
gay
almost
jolly
in
camp
he
was
dreamy
and
sombre
in
repose
to
escape
this
gloom
he
had
recourse
to
the
electricity
of
art
and
saw
visions
of
those
gigantic
monumental
works
of
which
he
undertook
many
and
completed
some
he
realized
that
such
works
are
part
of
the
life
of
peoples
they
are
history
written
in
capitals
landmarks
of
the
ages
left
standing
long
after
generations
are
swept
away
he
knew
that
rome
lives
in
her
ruins
that
greece
speaks
by
her
statues
that
egypt
splendid
and
mysterious
spectre
appeared
through
her
monuments
on
the
threshold
of
civilized
existence
what
he
loved
above
everything
what
he
hugged
in
preference
to
all
else
was
renown
heroic
uproar
hence
his
need
of
war
his
thirst
for
glory
he
often
said
a
great
reputation
is
a
great
noise
the
louder
it
is
the
further
it
is
heard
laws
institutions
monuments
nations
all
fall
but
sound
remains
and
resounds
through
other
generations
babylon
and
alexandria
are
fallen
semiramis
and
alexander
stand
erect
greater
perhaps
through
the
echo
of
their
renown
waxing
and
multiplying
through
the
ages
than
they
were
in
their
then
he
added
connecting
these
ideas
with
himself
my
power
depends
on
my
fame
and
on
the
battles
i
win
conquest
has
made
me
what
i
am
and
conquest
alone
can
sustain
me
a
new
born
government
must
dazzle
must
amaze
the
moment
it
no
longer
flames
it
dies
out
once
it
ceases
to
grow
it
he
was
long
a
corsican
impatient
under
the
conquest
of
his
country
but
after
the
vendemiaire
he
became
a
true
frenchman
and
ended
by
loving
france
with
true
passion
his
dream
was
to
see
her
great
happy
powerful
at
the
head
of
the
nations
in
glory
and
in
art
it
is
true
that
in
making
france
great
he
became
great
with
her
and
attached
his
name
indissolubly
to
her
grandeur
to
him
living
eternally
in
this
thought
actuality
disappeared
in
the
future
wherever
the
hurricane
of
war
may
have
swept
him
france
above
all
things
else
above
all
nations
filled
his
thoughts
what
will
my
athenians
think
said
alexander
after
issus
and
arbela
i
hope
the
french
will
be
content
with
me
said
bonaparte
after
rivoli
and
the
pyramids
before
battle
this
modern
alexander
gave
little
thought
to
what
he
should
do
in
case
of
victory
but
much
in
case
of
defeat
he
more
than
any
man
was
convinced
that
trifles
often
decide
the
greatest
events
he
was
therefore
more
concerned
in
foreseeing
such
events
than
in
producing
them
he
watched
them
come
to
birth
and
ripen
then
when
the
right
time
came
he
appeared
laid
his
hand
on
them
mastered
and
guided
them
as
an
able
rider
roasters
and
guides
a
spirited
horse
his
rapid
rise
in
the
midst
of
revolutions
and
political
changes
he
had
brought
about
or
seen
accomplished
the
events
which
he
had
controlled
had
given
him
a
certain
contempt
for
men
moreover
he
was
not
inclined
by
nature
to
think
well
of
them
his
lips
were
often
heard
to
utter
the
grievous
maxim
all
the
more
grievous
because
he
personally
knew
its
truth
there
are
two
levers
by
which
men
are
moved
fear
and
with
such
opinions
bonaparte
did
not
in
fact
believe
in
friendship
how
often
said
bourrienne
has
he
said
to
me
friendship
is
only
a
word
i
love
no
one
not
even
my
brothers
joseph
a
little
possibly
but
if
i
love
him
it
is
only
from
habit
and
because
he
is
my
elder
duroc
yes
i
love
him
but
why
because
his
character
pleases
me
because
he
is
stern
cold
resolute
besides
duroc
never
sheds
a
tear
but
why
should
i
love
any
one
do
you
think
i
have
any
true
friends
as
long
as
i
am
what
i
am
i
shall
have
friends
apparently
at
least
but
when
my
luck
ceases
you
ll
see
trees
don
t
have
leaves
in
winter
i
tell
you
bourrienne
we
must
leave
whimpering
to
the
women
it
s
their
business
as
for
me
no
feelings
i
need
a
vigorous
hand
and
a
stout
heart
if
not
better
let
war
and
government
in
his
familiar
intercourse
bonaparte
was
what
schoolboys
call
a
tease
but
his
teasings
were
never
spiteful
and
seldom
unkind
his
easily
aroused
disappeared
like
a
cloud
driven
by
the
wind
it
evaporated
in
words
and
disappeared
of
its
own
will
sometimes
however
when
matters
of
public
import
were
concerned
and
his
lieutenants
or
ministers
were
to
blame
he
gave
way
to
violent
anger
his
outbursts
were
then
hard
and
cruel
and
often
humiliating
he
gave
blows
with
a
club
under
which
willingly
or
unwillingly
the
recipient
had
to
bow
his
head
witness
his
scene
with
jomini
and
that
with
the
duc
de
bellune
bonaparte
had
two
sets
of
enemies
the
jacobins
and
the
royalists
he
detested
the
first
and
feared
the
second
in
speaking
of
the
jacobins
he
invariably
called
them
the
murderers
of
louis
xvi
as
for
the
royalists
that
was
another
thing
one
might
almost
have
thought
he
foresaw
the
restoration
he
had
about
him
two
men
who
had
voted
the
death
of
the
king
fouché
and
cambacérès
he
dismissed
fouché
and
if
he
kept
cambacérès
it
was
because
he
wanted
the
services
of
that
eminent
legist
but
he
could
not
endure
him
and
he
would
often
catch
his
colleague
the
second
consul
by
the
ear
and
say
my
poor
cambacérès
i
m
so
sorry
for
you
but
your
goose
is
cooked
if
ever
the
bourbons
get
back
they
will
hang
one
day
cambacérès
lost
his
temper
and
with
a
twist
of
his
head
he
pulled
his
ear
from
the
living
pincers
that
held
it
come
he
said
have
done
with
your
foolish
whenever
bonaparte
escaped
any
danger
a
childish
habit
a
corsican
habit
reappeared
he
always
made
a
rapid
sign
of
the
cross
on
his
breast
with
the
thumb
whenever
he
met
with
any
annoyance
or
was
haunted
with
a
disagreeable
thought
he
hummed
what
air
an
air
of
his
own
that
was
no
air
at
all
and
which
nobody
ever
noticed
he
sang
so
false
then
still
singing
he
would
sit
down
before
his
writing
desk
tilting
in
his
chair
tipping
it
back
till
he
almost
fell
over
and
mutilating
as
we
have
said
its
arms
with
a
penknife
which
served
no
other
purpose
inasmuch
as
he
never
mended
a
pen
himself
his
secretaries
were
charged
with
that
duty
and
they
mended
them
in
the
best
manner
possible
mindful
of
the
fact
that
they
would
have
to
copy
that
terrific
writing
which
as
we
know
was
not
absolutely
illegible
the
effect
produced
on
bonaparte
by
the
ringing
of
bells
is
known
it
was
the
only
music
he
understood
and
it
went
straight
to
his
heart
if
he
was
seated
when
the
vibrations
began
he
would
hold
up
his
hand
for
silence
and
lean
toward
the
sound
if
he
was
walking
he
would
stop
bend
his
head
and
listen
as
long
as
the
bell
rang
he
remained
motionless
when
the
sound
died
away
in
space
he
resumed
his
work
saying
to
those
who
asked
him
to
explain
this
singular
liking
for
the
iron
voice
it
reminds
me
of
my
first
years
at
brienne
i
was
happy
then
at
the
period
of
which
we
are
writing
his
greatest
personal
interest
was
the
purchase
he
had
made
of
the
domain
of
malmaison
he
went
there
every
night
like
a
schoolboy
off
for
his
holiday
and
spent
sunday
and
often
monday
there
there
work
was
neglected
for
walking
expeditions
during
which
he
personally
superintended
the
improvements
he
had
ordered
occasionally
and
especially
at
first
he
would
wander
beyond
the
limits
of
the
estate
but
these
excursions
were
thought
dangerous
by
the
police
and
given
up
entirely
after
the
conspiracy
of
the
aréna
and
the
affair
of
the
infernal
machine
the
revenue
derived
from
malmaison
calculated
by
bonaparte
himself
on
the
supposition
that
he
should
sell
his
fruits
and
vegetables
did
not
amount
to
more
than
six
thousand
francs
that
s
not
bad
he
said
to
bourrienne
but
he
added
with
a
sigh
one
must
have
thirty
thousand
a
year
to
be
able
to
live
bonaparte
introduced
a
certain
poesy
in
his
taste
for
the
country
he
liked
to
see
a
woman
with
a
tall
flexible
figure
glide
through
the
dusky
shrubberies
of
the
park
only
that
woman
must
be
dressed
in
white
he
hated
gowns
of
a
dark
color
and
had
a
horror
of
stout
women
as
for
pregnant
women
he
had
such
an
aversion
for
them
that
it
was
very
seldom
he
invited
one
to
his
soirées
or
his
fêtes
for
the
rest
with
little
gallantry
in
his
nature
too
overbearing
to
attract
scarcely
civil
to
women
it
was
rare
for
him
to
say
even
to
the
prettiest
a
pleasant
thing
in
fact
he
often
produced
a
shudder
by
the
rude
remarks
he
made
even
to
josephine
s
best
friends
to
one
he
remarked
oh
what
red
arms
you
have
to
another
what
an
ugly
headdress
you
are
wearing
to
a
third
your
gown
is
dirty
i
have
seen
you
wear
it
twenty
times
or
why
don
t
you
change
your
dressmaker
you
are
dressed
like
a
one
day
he
said
to
the
duchesse
de
chevreuse
a
charming
blonde
whose
hair
was
the
admiration
of
everyone
it
s
queer
how
red
your
hair
is
possibly
replied
the
duchess
but
this
is
the
first
time
any
man
has
told
me
bonaparte
did
not
like
cards
when
he
did
happen
to
play
it
was
always
for
the
rest
he
had
one
trait
in
common
with
henry
he
cheated
but
when
the
game
was
over
he
left
all
the
gold
and
notes
he
had
won
on
the
table
saying
you
are
ninnies
i
have
cheated
all
the
time
we
ve
been
playing
and
you
never
found
out
those
who
lost
can
take
their
money
born
and
bred
in
the
catholic
faith
bonaparte
had
no
preference
for
any
dogma
when
he
divine
worship
it
was
done
as
a
political
act
not
as
a
religious
one
he
was
fond
however
of
discussions
bearing
on
the
subject
but
he
defined
his
own
part
in
advance
by
saying
my
reason
makes
me
a
disbeliever
in
many
things
but
the
impressions
of
my
childhood
and
the
inspirations
of
my
early
youth
have
flung
me
back
into
nevertheless
he
would
never
hear
of
materialism
he
cared
little
what
the
dogma
was
provided
that
dogma
recognized
a
creator
one
beautiful
evening
in
messidor
on
board
his
vessel
as
it
glided
along
between
the
twofold
azure
of
the
sky
and
sea
certain
mathematicians
declared
there
was
no
god
only
animated
matter
bonaparte
looked
at
the
celestial
arch
a
hundred
times
more
brilliant
between
malta
and
alexandria
than
it
is
in
europe
and
at
a
moment
when
they
thought
him
unconscious
of
the
conversation
he
exclaimed
pointing
to
the
stars
you
may
say
what
you
please
but
it
was
a
god
who
made
all
bonaparte
though
very
exact
in
paying
his
private
debts
was
just
the
reverse
about
public
expenses
he
was
firmly
convinced
that
in
all
past
transactions
between
ministers
and
purveyors
or
contractors
that
if
the
minister
who
had
made
the
contract
was
not
a
dupe
the
state
at
any
rate
was
robbed
for
this
reason
he
delayed
the
period
of
payment
as
long
as
possible
there
were
literally
no
evasions
no
difficulties
he
would
not
make
no
bad
reasons
he
would
not
give
it
was
a
fixed
idea
with
him
an
immutable
principle
that
every
contractor
was
a
cheat
one
day
a
man
who
had
made
a
bid
that
was
accepted
was
presented
to
him
what
is
your
name
he
asked
with
his
accustomed
brusqueness
vollant
citizen
first
good
name
for
a
i
spell
it
with
two
l
s
to
rob
the
better
sir
retorted
bonaparte
turning
his
back
on
him
bonaparte
seldom
changed
his
decisions
even
when
he
saw
they
were
unjust
no
one
ever
heard
him
say
i
was
on
the
contrary
his
favorite
saying
was
i
always
believe
the
worst
a
saying
more
worthy
of
simon
than
augustus
but
with
all
this
one
felt
that
there
was
more
of
a
desire
in
bonaparte
s
mind
to
seem
to
despise
men
than
actual
contempt
for
them
he
was
neither
malignant
nor
vindictive
sometimes
it
is
true
he
relied
too
much
upon
necessity
that
goddess
but
for
the
rest
take
him
away
from
the
field
of
politics
and
he
was
kind
sympathetic
accessible
to
pity
fond
of
children
great
proof
of
a
kind
and
pitying
heart
full
of
indulgence
for
human
weakness
in
private
life
and
sometimes
of
a
heartiness
like
that
of
henri
iv
playing
with
his
children
in
the
presence
of
the
spanish
ambassador
if
we
were
writing
history
we
should
have
many
more
things
to
say
of
bonaparte
without
counting
those
which
after
finishing
with
bonaparte
we
should
still
have
to
say
of
napoleon
but
we
are
writing
a
simple
narrative
in
which
bonaparte
plays
a
part
unfortunately
wherever
bonaparte
shows
himself
if
only
for
a
moment
he
becomes
in
spite
of
himself
a
principal
personage
the
reader
must
pardon
us
for
having
again
fallen
into
digression
that
man
who
is
a
world
in
himself
has
against
our
will
swept
us
along
in
his
whirlwind
let
us
return
to
roland
and
consequently
to
our
legitimate
tale
chapter
xxxvii
the
ambassador
we
have
seen
that
roland
on
returning
to
the
luxembourg
asked
for
the
first
consul
and
was
told
that
he
was
engaged
with
fouché
the
minister
of
police
roland
was
a
privileged
person
no
matter
what
functionary
was
with
bonaparte
he
was
in
the
habit
on
his
return
from
a
journey
or
merely
from
an
errand
of
half
opening
the
door
and
putting
in
his
head
the
first
consul
was
often
so
busy
that
he
paid
no
attention
to
this
head
when
that
was
the
case
roland
would
say
general
which
meant
in
the
close
intimacy
which
still
existed
between
the
two
schoolmates
general
i
am
here
do
you
need
me
i
m
at
your
if
the
first
consul
did
not
need
him
he
replied
very
if
on
the
contrary
he
did
need
him
he
said
simply
come
then
roland
would
enter
and
wait
in
the
recess
of
a
window
until
the
general
told
him
what
he
wanted
on
this
occasion
roland
put
his
head
in
as
usual
saying
general
come
in
replied
the
first
consul
with
visible
satisfaction
come
in
come
in
roland
entered
bonaparte
was
as
he
had
been
told
busy
with
the
minister
of
police
the
affair
on
which
the
first
consul
was
engaged
and
which
seemed
to
absorb
him
a
great
deal
had
also
its
interest
for
roland
it
concerned
the
recent
stoppages
of
diligences
by
the
companions
of
jehu
on
the
table
lay
three
relating
the
stoppage
of
one
diligence
and
two
tribier
the
paymaster
of
the
army
of
italy
was
in
one
of
the
latter
the
stoppages
had
occurred
one
on
the
highroad
between
meximieux
and
montluel
on
that
part
of
the
road
which
crosses
the
commune
of
bellignieux
the
second
at
the
extremity
of
the
lake
of
silans
in
the
direction
of
nantua
the
third
on
the
highroad
between
and
bourg
at
a
spot
called
les
carronnières
a
curious
fact
was
connected
with
these
stoppages
a
sum
of
four
thousand
francs
and
a
case
of
jewelry
had
been
mixed
up
by
mistake
with
the
belonging
to
the
government
the
owners
of
the
money
had
thought
them
lost
when
the
justice
of
the
peace
at
nantua
received
an
unsigned
letter
telling
him
the
place
where
these
objects
had
been
buried
and
requesting
him
to
return
them
to
their
rightful
owners
as
the
companions
of
jehu
made
war
upon
the
government
and
not
against
private
individuals
in
another
case
that
of
the
carronnières
where
the
robbers
in
order
to
stop
the
which
had
continued
on
its
way
with
increased
speed
in
spite
of
the
order
to
stop
were
forced
to
fire
at
a
horse
the
companions
of
jehu
had
felt
themselves
obliged
to
make
good
this
loss
to
the
postmaster
who
had
received
five
hundred
francs
for
the
dead
horse
that
was
exactly
what
the
animal
had
cost
eight
days
before
and
this
valuation
proved
that
they
were
dealing
with
men
who
understood
horses
the
sent
by
the
local
authorities
were
accompanied
by
the
affidavits
of
the
travellers
bonaparte
was
singing
that
mysterious
tune
of
which
we
have
spoken
which
showed
that
he
was
furious
so
as
roland
might
be
expected
to
bring
him
fresh
information
he
had
called
him
three
times
to
come
in
well
said
he
your
part
of
the
country
is
certainly
in
revolt
against
me
just
look
at
roland
glanced
at
the
papers
and
understood
at
once
exactly
what
i
came
to
speak
to
you
about
general
said
he
then
begin
at
once
but
first
go
ask
bourrienne
for
my
department
roland
fetched
the
atlas
and
guessing
what
bonaparte
desired
to
look
at
opened
it
at
the
department
of
the
ain
that
s
it
said
bonaparte
show
me
where
these
affairs
roland
laid
his
finger
on
the
edge
of
the
map
in
the
neighborhood
of
lyons
there
general
that
s
the
exact
place
of
the
first
attack
near
the
village
of
and
the
second
here
said
roland
pointing
to
the
other
side
of
the
department
toward
geneva
there
s
the
lake
of
nantua
and
here
s
that
of
now
the
third
roland
laid
his
finger
on
the
centre
of
the
map
general
there
s
the
exact
spot
les
carronnières
are
not
marked
on
the
map
because
of
their
slight
what
are
les
carronnières
asked
the
first
consul
general
in
our
part
of
the
country
the
manufactories
of
tiles
are
called
they
belong
to
citizen
terrier
that
s
the
place
they
ought
to
be
on
the
and
roland
made
a
pencil
mark
on
the
paper
to
show
the
exact
spot
where
the
stoppage
occurred
what
exclaimed
bonaparte
why
it
happened
less
than
a
mile
and
a
half
from
bourg
scarcely
that
general
that
explains
why
the
wounded
horse
was
taken
back
to
bourg
and
died
in
the
stables
of
the
do
you
hear
all
these
details
sir
said
bonaparte
addressing
the
minister
of
police
yes
citizen
first
consul
answered
the
latter
you
know
i
want
this
brigandage
to
stop
i
shall
use
every
effort
it
s
not
a
question
of
your
efforts
but
of
its
being
the
minister
bowed
it
is
only
on
that
condition
said
bonaparte
that
i
shall
admit
you
are
the
able
man
you
claim
to
i
ll
help
you
citizen
said
roland
i
did
not
venture
to
ask
for
your
assistance
said
the
minister
yes
but
i
offer
it
don
t
do
anything
that
we
have
not
planned
the
minister
looked
at
bonaparte
quite
right
said
bonaparte
you
can
go
roland
will
follow
you
to
the
fouché
bowed
and
left
the
room
now
continued
the
first
consul
your
honor
depends
upon
your
exterminating
these
bandits
roland
in
the
first
place
the
thing
is
being
carried
on
in
your
department
and
next
they
seem
to
have
some
particular
grudge
against
you
and
your
on
the
contrary
said
roland
that
s
what
makes
me
so
furious
they
spare
me
and
my
let
s
go
over
it
again
roland
every
detail
is
of
importance
it
s
a
war
of
bedouins
over
just
notice
this
general
i
spend
a
night
in
the
chartreuse
of
seillon
because
i
have
been
told
that
it
was
haunted
by
ghosts
sure
enough
a
ghost
appears
but
a
perfectly
inoffensive
one
i
fire
at
it
twice
and
it
doesn
t
even
turn
around
my
mother
is
in
a
diligence
that
is
stopped
and
faints
away
one
of
the
robbers
pays
her
the
most
delicate
attentions
bathes
her
temples
with
vinegar
and
gives
her
my
brother
edouard
fights
them
as
best
he
can
they
take
him
in
their
arms
kiss
him
and
make
him
all
sorts
of
compliments
on
his
courage
a
little
more
and
they
would
have
given
him
as
a
reward
for
his
gallant
conduct
now
just
the
reverse
my
friend
sir
john
follows
my
example
goes
where
i
have
been
he
is
treated
as
a
spy
and
stabbed
as
they
thought
to
but
he
didn
t
no
on
the
contrary
he
is
so
well
that
he
wants
to
marry
my
ah
ha
has
he
asked
for
her
and
you
answered
i
answered
that
the
matter
depended
on
two
your
mother
and
you
that
s
no
my
sister
herself
and
your
sister
i
understand
but
i
didn
t
you
tell
me
general
that
you
would
take
charge
of
marrying
her
bonaparte
walked
up
and
down
the
room
with
his
arms
crossed
then
suddenly
stopping
before
roland
he
said
what
is
your
englishman
like
you
have
seen
him
i
don
t
mean
physically
all
englishmen
are
alike
blue
eyes
red
hair
white
skin
long
that
s
their
said
roland
gravely
their
yes
did
you
ever
learn
english
general
faith
i
tried
to
learn
your
teacher
must
have
told
you
that
the
was
sounded
by
pressing
the
tongue
against
the
teeth
well
by
dint
of
punching
their
teeth
with
their
tongues
the
english
have
ended
by
getting
those
elongated
jaws
which
as
you
said
just
now
is
one
of
the
distinctive
characteristics
of
their
bonaparte
looked
at
roland
to
see
if
that
incorrigible
jester
were
laughing
or
speaking
seriously
roland
was
imperturbable
is
that
your
opinion
said
bonaparte
yes
general
and
i
think
that
physiologically
it
is
as
good
as
any
other
i
have
a
lot
of
opinions
like
it
which
i
bring
to
light
as
the
occasion
come
back
to
your
certainly
i
asked
you
what
he
was
well
he
is
a
gentleman
very
brave
very
calm
very
impassible
very
noble
very
rich
and
moreover
which
may
not
be
a
recommendation
to
you
a
nephew
of
lord
grenville
prime
minister
to
his
britannic
what
s
that
i
said
prime
minister
to
his
britannic
bonaparte
resumed
his
walk
then
presently
returning
to
roland
he
said
can
i
see
your
englishman
you
know
general
that
you
can
do
where
is
he
in
go
find
him
and
bring
him
roland
was
in
the
habit
of
obeying
without
reply
he
took
his
hat
and
went
toward
the
door
send
bourrienne
to
me
said
the
first
consul
just
as
roland
passed
into
the
secretary
s
room
five
minutes
later
bourrienne
appeared
sit
down
there
bourrienne
said
the
first
consul
and
bourrienne
sat
down
arranged
his
paper
dipped
his
pen
in
the
ink
and
waited
ready
asked
the
first
consul
sitting
down
upon
the
writing
table
which
was
another
of
his
habits
a
habit
that
reduced
his
secretary
to
despair
for
bonaparte
never
ceased
swinging
himself
back
and
forth
all
the
time
he
dictated
a
motion
that
shook
the
table
as
much
as
if
it
had
been
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
with
a
heaving
sea
i
m
ready
replied
bourrienne
who
had
ended
by
forcing
himself
to
endure
with
more
or
less
patience
all
bonaparte
s
eccentricities
then
and
he
dictated
bonaparte
first
consul
of
the
republic
to
his
majesty
the
king
of
great
britain
and
ireland
called
by
the
will
of
the
french
nation
to
the
chief
magistracy
of
the
republic
i
think
it
proper
to
inform
your
majesty
personally
of
this
fact
must
the
war
which
for
two
years
has
ravaged
the
four
quarters
of
the
globe
be
perpetuated
is
there
no
means
of
staying
it
how
is
it
that
two
nations
the
most
enlightened
of
europe
more
powerful
and
strong
than
their
own
safety
and
independence
require
how
is
it
that
they
sacrifice
to
their
ideas
of
empty
grandeur
or
bigoted
antipathies
the
welfare
of
commerce
eternal
prosperity
the
happiness
of
families
how
is
it
that
they
do
not
recognize
that
peace
is
the
first
of
needs
and
the
first
of
a
nation
s
glories
these
sentiments
can
not
be
foreign
to
the
heart
of
a
king
who
governs
a
free
nation
with
the
sole
object
of
rendering
it
happy
your
majesty
will
see
in
this
overture
my
sincere
desire
to
contribute
efficaciously
for
the
second
time
to
a
general
pacification
by
an
advance
frankly
made
and
free
of
those
formalities
which
necessary
perhaps
to
disguise
the
dependence
of
feeble
states
only
disclose
in
powerful
nations
a
mutual
desire
to
deceive
france
and
england
can
for
a
long
time
yet
by
the
abuse
of
their
powers
and
to
the
misery
of
their
people
carry
on
the
struggle
without
exhaustion
but
and
i
dare
say
it
the
fate
of
all
the
civilized
nations
depends
on
the
conclusion
of
a
war
which
involves
the
universe
bonaparte
paused
i
think
that
will
do
said
he
read
it
over
bourrienne
read
the
letter
he
had
just
written
after
each
paragraph
the
first
consul
nodded
approvingly
and
said
go
before
the
last
words
were
fairly
uttered
he
took
the
letter
from
bourrienne
s
hands
and
signed
it
with
a
new
pen
it
was
a
habit
of
his
never
to
use
the
same
pen
twice
nothing
could
be
more
disagreeable
to
him
than
a
spot
of
ink
on
his
fingers
that
s
good
said
he
seal
it
and
put
on
the
address
to
lord
bourrienne
did
as
he
was
told
at
the
same
moment
the
noise
of
a
carriage
was
heard
entering
the
courtyard
of
the
luxembourg
a
moment
later
the
door
opened
and
roland
appeared
well
asked
bonaparte
didn
t
i
tell
you
you
could
have
anything
you
wanted
general
have
you
brought
your
englishman
i
met
him
in
the
place
de
buci
and
knowing
that
you
don
t
like
to
wait
i
caught
him
just
as
he
was
and
made
him
get
into
the
carriage
faith
i
thought
i
should
have
to
drive
round
to
the
rue
mazarine
and
get
a
guard
to
bring
him
he
s
in
boots
and
a
let
him
come
in
said
bonaparte
come
in
sir
john
cried
roland
turning
round
lord
tanlay
appeared
on
the
threshold
bonaparte
had
only
to
glance
at
him
to
recognize
a
perfect
gentleman
a
trifling
emaciation
a
slight
pallor
gave
sir
john
the
characteristics
of
great
distinction
he
bowed
awaiting
the
formal
introduction
like
the
true
englishman
he
was
general
said
roland
i
have
the
honor
to
present
to
you
sir
john
tanlay
who
proposed
to
go
to
the
third
cataract
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
you
but
who
has
obliged
me
to
drag
him
by
the
ear
to
the
come
in
my
lord
come
in
said
bonaparte
this
is
not
the
first
time
we
have
seen
each
other
nor
the
first
that
i
have
expressed
the
wish
to
know
you
there
was
therefore
positive
ingratitude
in
trying
to
evade
my
if
i
hesitated
said
sir
john
in
excellent
french
as
usual
it
was
because
i
could
scarcely
believe
in
the
honor
you
do
and
besides
very
naturally
from
national
feeling
you
detest
me
don
t
you
like
the
rest
of
your
countrymen
i
must
confess
general
answered
sir
john
smiling
that
they
have
not
got
beyond
and
do
you
share
the
absurd
prejudice
that
claims
that
national
honor
requires
you
to
hate
the
enemy
who
may
be
a
friend
france
has
been
almost
a
second
mother
country
to
me
and
my
friend
roland
will
tell
you
that
i
long
for
the
moment
when
of
my
two
countries
the
one
to
which
i
shall
owe
the
most
will
be
then
you
ought
to
see
france
and
england
shaking
hands
for
the
good
of
the
world
without
the
day
when
i
see
that
will
be
a
happy
day
for
if
you
could
contribute
to
bring
it
about
would
you
do
so
i
would
risk
my
life
to
do
roland
tells
me
you
are
a
relative
of
lord
his
are
you
on
good
terms
with
him
he
was
very
fond
of
my
mother
his
eldest
have
you
inherited
the
fondness
he
bore
your
mother
yes
only
i
think
he
holds
it
in
reserve
till
i
return
to
will
you
deliver
a
letter
for
me
to
whom
king
george
i
shall
be
greatly
will
you
undertake
to
say
to
your
uncle
that
which
can
not
be
written
in
a
letter
without
changing
a
syllable
the
words
of
general
bonaparte
are
well
tell
him
but
interrupting
himself
he
turned
to
bourrienne
saying
bourrienne
find
me
the
last
letter
from
the
emperor
of
bourrienne
opened
a
box
and
without
searching
laid
his
hand
on
a
letter
that
he
handed
to
bonaparte
the
first
consul
cast
his
eye
over
the
paper
and
then
gave
it
to
lord
tanlay
tell
him
said
he
first
and
before
all
that
you
have
read
this
sir
john
bowed
and
read
as
follows
citizen
first
consul
i
have
received
each
armed
and
newly
clothed
in
the
uniform
of
his
regiment
the
nine
thousand
russians
made
prisoners
in
holland
whom
you
have
returned
to
me
without
ransom
exchange
or
condition
of
any
kind
this
is
pure
chivalry
and
i
boast
of
being
chivalrous
i
think
that
which
i
can
best
offer
you
in
exchange
for
this
magnificent
present
citizen
first
consul
is
my
friendship
will
you
accept
it
as
an
earnest
of
that
friendship
i
am
sending
his
passports
to
lord
whitworth
the
british
ambassador
to
saint
petersburg
furthermore
if
you
will
be
i
do
not
say
my
second
but
my
witness
i
will
challenge
personally
every
king
who
will
not
take
part
against
england
and
close
his
ports
to
her
i
begin
with
my
neighbor
the
king
of
denmark
and
you
will
find
in
the
gazette
de
la
cour
the
ultimatum
i
have
sent
him
what
more
can
i
say
to
you
nothing
unless
it
be
that
you
and
i
together
can
give
laws
to
the
world
i
am
your
admirer
and
sincere
friend
paul
lord
tanlay
turned
to
the
first
consul
of
course
you
know
said
he
that
the
emperor
of
russia
is
is
it
that
letter
that
makes
you
think
so
my
lord
asked
bonaparte
no
but
it
confirms
my
it
was
a
madman
who
gave
henry
vi
of
lancaster
the
crown
of
and
the
blazon
of
england
still
bears
until
i
scratch
them
out
with
my
sword
the
of
sir
john
smiled
his
national
pride
revolted
at
this
assumption
in
the
conqueror
of
the
pyramids
but
said
bonaparte
that
is
not
the
question
everything
in
its
own
yes
murmured
sir
john
we
are
too
near
oh
i
shall
never
defeat
you
at
sea
said
bonaparte
it
would
take
fifty
years
to
make
france
a
maritime
nation
but
over
there
and
he
motioned
with
his
hand
to
the
east
at
the
present
moment
i
repeat
that
the
question
is
not
war
but
peace
i
must
have
peace
to
accomplish
my
dream
and
above
all
peace
with
england
you
see
i
play
aboveboard
i
am
strong
enough
to
speak
frankly
if
the
day
ever
comes
when
a
diplomatist
tells
the
truth
he
will
be
the
first
diplomatist
in
the
world
for
no
one
will
believe
him
and
he
will
attain
unopposed
his
then
i
am
to
tell
my
uncle
that
you
desire
at
the
same
time
letting
him
know
that
i
do
not
fear
war
if
i
can
t
ally
myself
with
king
george
i
can
as
you
see
do
so
with
the
emperor
paul
but
russia
has
not
reached
that
point
of
civilization
that
i
desire
in
an
a
tool
is
sometimes
more
useful
than
an
yes
but
as
you
said
the
emperor
is
mad
and
it
is
better
to
disarm
than
to
arm
a
madman
i
tell
you
that
two
nations
like
france
and
england
ought
to
be
inseparable
friends
or
relentless
enemies
friends
they
are
the
poles
of
the
world
balancing
its
movements
with
perfect
equilibrium
enemies
one
must
destroy
the
other
and
become
the
world
s
sole
but
suppose
lord
grenville
not
doubting
your
genius
still
doubts
your
power
if
he
holds
the
opinion
of
our
poet
coleridge
that
our
island
needs
no
rampart
no
bulwark
other
than
the
raucous
murmur
of
the
ocean
what
shall
i
tell
him
unroll
the
map
of
the
world
bourrienne
said
bonaparte
bourrienne
unrolled
a
map
bonaparte
stepped
over
to
it
do
you
see
those
two
rivers
said
he
pointing
to
the
volga
and
the
danube
that
s
the
road
to
india
he
added
i
thought
egypt
was
general
said
sir
john
so
did
i
for
a
time
or
rather
i
took
it
because
i
had
no
other
but
the
czar
opens
this
one
your
government
can
force
me
to
take
it
do
you
follow
me
yes
citizen
go
well
if
england
forces
me
to
fight
her
if
i
am
obliged
to
accept
this
alliance
with
catherine
s
successor
this
is
what
i
shall
do
i
shall
embark
forty
thousand
russians
on
the
volga
i
shall
send
them
down
the
river
to
astrakhan
they
will
cross
the
caspian
and
await
me
at
sir
john
bowed
in
sign
of
deep
attention
bonaparte
continued
i
shall
embark
forty
thousand
frenchmen
on
the
excuse
me
citizen
first
consul
but
the
danube
is
an
austrian
i
shall
have
taken
sir
john
stared
at
bonaparte
i
shall
have
taken
vienna
continued
the
latter
i
shall
then
embark
forty
thousand
frenchmen
on
the
danube
i
find
russian
vessels
at
its
mouth
ready
to
transport
them
to
taganrog
i
march
them
by
land
along
the
course
of
the
don
to
pratisbianskaïa
whence
they
move
to
tzaritsin
there
they
descend
the
volga
in
the
same
vessels
that
have
transported
the
forty
thousand
russians
to
asterabad
fifteen
days
later
i
have
eighty
thousand
men
in
western
persia
from
asterabad
these
united
corps
will
march
to
the
indus
persia
the
enemy
of
england
is
our
natural
yes
but
once
in
the
punjab
the
persian
alliance
will
do
you
no
good
and
an
army
of
eighty
thousand
men
can
not
drag
its
provisions
along
with
you
forget
one
thing
said
bonaparte
as
if
the
expedition
were
already
under
way
i
have
left
bankers
at
teheran
and
caboul
now
remember
what
happened
nine
years
ago
in
lord
cornwallis
war
with
tippo
saïb
the
fell
short
of
provisions
and
a
simple
captain
i
forget
his
captain
malcolm
said
lord
tanlay
that
s
it
cried
bonaparte
you
know
the
story
captain
malcolm
had
recourse
to
the
brinjaries
those
bohemians
of
india
who
cover
the
whole
hindostan
peninsula
with
their
encampments
and
control
the
grain
supplies
well
those
bohemians
are
faithful
to
the
last
penny
to
those
who
pay
them
they
will
feed
you
must
cross
the
what
of
that
exclaimed
bonaparte
i
have
a
hundred
and
eighty
miles
of
bank
between
and
attok
to
choose
from
i
know
the
indus
as
well
as
i
do
the
seine
it
is
a
slow
current
flowing
about
three
miles
an
hour
its
medium
depth
is
i
should
say
at
the
point
i
mentioned
from
twelve
to
fifteen
feet
and
there
are
ten
or
more
fords
on
the
line
of
my
then
your
line
is
already
traced
out
asked
sir
john
smiling
yes
in
so
far
as
it
follows
a
broad
uninterrupted
stretch
of
fertile
provinces
that
i
avoid
the
sandy
deserts
which
separate
the
lower
valley
of
the
indus
from
rajputana
and
also
that
i
follow
the
general
bases
of
all
invasions
of
india
that
have
had
any
success
from
mahmoud
of
ghazni
in
the
year
to
nadir
shah
in
and
how
many
have
taken
the
route
i
mean
to
take
between
the
two
epochs
let
us
count
them
after
mahmoud
of
ghazni
came
mohammed
ghori
in
with
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
men
after
him
timur
tang
or
timur
the
lame
whom
we
call
tamerlane
with
sixty
thousand
men
after
tamerlane
babar
after
babar
humajan
and
how
many
more
i
can
t
remember
why
india
is
there
for
whoever
will
go
and
take
it
you
forget
citizen
first
consul
that
all
the
conquerors
you
have
named
had
only
the
aboriginal
populations
to
deal
with
whereas
you
have
the
english
we
hold
india
with
from
twenty
to
thousand
and
a
hundred
thousand
i
have
counted
them
all
and
i
regard
england
and
india
the
one
with
the
respect
the
other
with
the
contempt
they
merit
wherever
i
meet
european
infantry
i
prepare
a
second
a
third
and
if
necessary
a
fourth
line
of
reserves
believing
that
the
first
three
might
give
way
before
the
british
bayonets
but
wherever
i
find
the
sepoys
i
need
only
the
postilion
s
whip
to
scatter
the
rabble
have
you
any
other
questions
to
put
to
me
my
lord
one
citizen
first
consul
are
you
sincerely
desirous
of
peace
here
is
the
letter
in
which
i
ask
it
of
your
king
my
lord
and
it
is
to
be
quite
sure
that
it
reaches
his
britannic
majesty
that
i
ask
lord
grenville
s
nephew
to
be
my
it
shall
be
done
as
you
desire
citizen
and
were
i
the
uncle
instead
of
the
nephew
i
should
promise
when
can
you
start
in
an
hour
i
shall
be
you
have
no
wish
to
express
to
me
before
leaving
none
in
any
case
if
i
have
any
i
leave
my
affairs
to
my
friend
shake
hands
with
me
my
lord
it
will
be
a
good
omen
as
you
represent
england
and
i
sir
john
accepted
the
honor
done
him
by
bonaparte
with
the
exact
measure
of
cordiality
that
indicated
both
his
sympathy
for
france
and
his
mental
reserves
for
the
honor
of
his
own
nation
then
having
pressed
roland
s
hand
with
fraternal
effusion
he
bowed
again
to
the
first
consul
and
went
out
bonaparte
followed
him
reflectively
with
his
eyes
then
he
said
suddenly
roland
i
not
only
consent
to
your
sister
s
marriage
with
lord
tanlay
but
i
wish
it
do
you
understand
wish
he
laid
such
emphasis
upon
those
three
words
that
to
any
one
who
knew
him
they
signified
plainly
not
i
wish
but
i
the
tyranny
was
sweet
to
roland
and
he
accepted
it
with
grateful
thanks
chapter
xxxviii
the
two
signals
let
us
now
relate
what
happened
at
the
château
des
three
days
after
the
events
we
have
just
described
took
place
in
paris
since
the
successive
departures
of
roland
then
madame
de
montrevel
and
her
son
and
finally
sir
john
roland
to
rejoin
his
general
madame
de
montrevel
to
place
edouard
in
school
and
sir
john
to
acquaint
roland
with
his
matrimonial
plans
amélie
had
remained
alone
with
charlotte
at
the
château
des
we
say
because
michel
and
his
son
jacques
did
not
live
in
the
house
but
in
the
little
lodge
at
the
gate
where
he
added
the
duties
of
porter
to
those
of
gardener
it
therefore
happened
that
at
night
all
the
windows
excepting
those
of
amélie
which
as
we
have
said
were
on
the
first
floor
overlooking
the
garden
and
that
of
charlotte
in
the
attic
were
left
in
darkness
madame
de
montrevel
had
taken
the
second
chambermaid
with
her
the
two
young
girls
were
perhaps
rather
isolated
in
their
part
of
the
house
which
consisted
of
a
dozen
bedrooms
on
three
floors
especially
at
a
time
when
so
many
rumors
of
robberies
on
the
highroads
reached
them
michel
therefore
proposed
to
his
young
mistress
that
he
sleep
in
the
main
building
so
as
to
be
near
her
in
case
of
need
but
she
in
a
firm
voice
assured
him
that
she
felt
no
fear
and
desired
no
change
in
the
customary
routine
of
the
château
michel
did
not
insist
and
retired
saying
that
mademoiselle
might
in
any
case
sleep
in
peace
for
he
and
jacques
would
make
the
rounds
of
the
house
during
the
night
amélie
at
first
seemed
anxious
about
those
rounds
but
she
soon
noticed
that
michel
and
jacques
contented
themselves
with
watching
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
of
seillon
and
the
frequent
appearance
of
a
jugged
hare
or
a
haunch
of
venison
on
the
table
proved
to
her
that
michel
kept
his
word
regarding
the
promised
rounds
she
therefore
ceased
to
trouble
about
michel
s
rounds
which
were
always
on
the
side
of
the
house
opposite
to
that
where
she
feared
them
now
as
we
have
said
three
days
after
the
events
we
have
just
related
or
to
speak
more
correctly
during
the
night
following
the
third
day
those
who
were
accustomed
to
see
no
light
save
in
amélie
s
windows
on
the
first
floor
and
charlotte
s
on
the
third
might
have
observed
with
surprise
that
from
eleven
o
clock
until
midnight
the
four
windows
on
the
first
floor
were
illuminated
it
is
true
that
each
was
lighted
by
a
single
they
might
also
have
seen
the
figure
of
a
young
girl
through
the
shades
staring
in
the
direction
of
the
village
of
ceyzeriat
this
young
girl
was
amélie
pale
breathing
with
difficulty
and
seeming
to
watch
anxiously
for
a
signal
at
the
end
of
a
few
minutes
she
wiped
her
forehead
and
drew
a
joyous
breath
a
fire
was
lighted
in
the
direction
she
had
been
watching
then
she
passed
from
room
to
room
putting
out
the
three
candles
one
after
the
other
leaving
only
the
one
which
was
burning
in
her
own
room
as
if
the
fire
awaited
this
return
signal
it
was
now
extinguished
amélie
sat
down
by
her
window
and
remained
motionless
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
garden
the
night
was
dark
without
moon
or
stars
and
yet
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
saw
or
rather
divined
a
shadow
crossing
the
lawn
and
approaching
the
window
she
placed
her
single
candle
in
the
furthest
corner
of
her
room
and
returned
to
open
her
window
he
whom
she
was
awaiting
was
already
on
the
balcony
as
on
the
first
night
when
we
saw
him
climb
it
the
young
man
put
his
arm
around
the
girl
s
waist
and
drew
her
into
the
room
she
made
but
slight
resistance
her
hand
sought
the
cord
of
the
venetian
blind
unfastened
it
from
the
hook
that
held
it
and
let
it
fall
with
more
noise
than
prudence
would
have
counselled
behind
the
blind
she
closed
the
window
then
she
fetched
the
candle
from
the
corner
where
she
had
hidden
it
the
light
illuminated
her
face
and
the
young
man
gave
a
cry
of
alarm
for
it
was
covered
with
tears
what
has
happened
he
asked
a
great
misfortune
replied
the
young
girl
oh
i
feared
it
when
i
saw
the
signal
by
which
you
recalled
me
after
receiving
me
last
night
but
is
it
irreparable
almost
answered
amélie
i
hope
at
least
that
it
threatens
only
it
threatens
us
the
young
man
passed
his
hand
over
his
brow
to
wipe
away
the
sweat
that
covered
it
tell
me
said
he
you
know
i
am
if
you
have
the
strength
to
hear
it
said
she
i
have
none
to
tell
then
taking
a
letter
from
the
she
added
read
that
that
is
what
i
received
by
the
post
the
young
man
took
the
letter
opened
it
and
glanced
hastily
at
the
signature
from
madame
de
montrevel
said
he
yes
with
a
postscript
from
the
young
man
read
my
dearest
daughter
i
hope
that
the
news
i
announce
will
give
you
as
much
joy
as
it
has
already
given
our
dear
roland
and
me
sir
john
whose
heart
you
doubted
claiming
that
it
was
only
a
mechanical
contrivance
manufactured
in
the
workshops
at
vaucanson
admits
that
such
an
opinion
was
a
just
one
until
the
day
he
saw
you
but
he
maintains
that
since
that
day
he
has
a
heart
and
that
that
heart
adores
you
did
you
suspect
it
my
dear
amélie
from
his
aristocratic
and
polished
manners
when
your
mother
s
eyes
failed
to
discern
this
tenderness
this
morning
while
breakfasting
with
your
brother
he
formally
asked
your
hand
your
brother
received
the
offer
with
joy
but
he
made
no
promises
at
first
the
first
consul
before
roland
s
departure
for
the
vendée
had
already
spoken
of
making
himself
responsible
for
your
establishment
but
since
then
he
has
asked
to
see
lord
tanlay
and
sir
john
though
he
maintained
his
national
reserve
was
taken
into
the
first
consul
s
good
graces
at
once
to
such
a
degree
that
he
received
from
him
at
their
first
interview
a
mission
to
his
uncle
lord
grenville
sir
john
started
for
england
immediately
i
do
not
know
how
many
days
sir
john
will
be
absent
but
on
his
return
he
is
certain
to
present
himself
to
you
as
your
betrothed
lord
tanlay
is
still
young
pleasing
in
appearance
and
immensely
rich
he
is
highly
connected
in
england
and
roland
s
friend
i
do
not
know
a
man
who
has
more
right
i
will
not
say
to
your
love
but
to
your
profound
esteem
the
rest
of
my
news
i
can
tell
you
in
two
words
the
first
consul
is
still
most
kind
to
me
and
to
your
two
brothers
and
madame
bonaparte
has
let
me
know
that
she
only
awaits
your
marriage
to
place
you
near
her
there
is
talk
of
leaving
the
luxembourg
and
removing
to
the
tuileries
do
you
understand
the
full
meaning
of
this
change
of
domicile
your
mother
who
loves
you
clotilde
de
montrevel
without
pausing
the
young
man
turned
to
roland
s
postscript
it
was
as
follows
you
have
read
my
dear
little
sister
what
our
good
mother
has
written
this
marriage
is
a
suitable
one
under
all
aspects
it
is
not
a
thing
to
be
childish
about
the
first
consul
you
to
become
lady
tanlay
that
is
to
say
he
it
i
am
leaving
paris
for
a
few
days
though
you
may
not
see
me
you
will
hear
of
me
i
kiss
you
roland
well
charles
asked
amélie
when
the
young
man
had
finished
reading
what
do
you
think
of
that
that
it
is
something
we
had
to
expect
from
day
to
day
my
poor
angel
but
it
is
none
the
less
what
is
to
be
done
there
are
three
things
we
can
tell
in
the
first
place
resist
if
you
have
the
strength
it
is
the
shortest
and
surest
amélie
dropped
her
head
you
will
never
dare
will
you
and
yet
you
are
my
wife
amélie
a
priest
has
blessed
our
but
they
say
that
marriage
before
a
priest
is
null
before
the
is
it
not
enough
for
you
the
wife
of
a
proscribed
man
asked
morgan
his
voice
trembling
as
he
spoke
amélie
flung
herself
into
his
arms
but
my
mother
said
she
our
marriage
did
not
have
her
presence
and
because
there
were
too
many
risks
to
run
and
we
wished
to
run
them
but
that
man
did
you
notice
that
my
brother
says
he
it
oh
if
you
loved
me
amélie
that
man
would
see
that
he
may
change
the
face
of
the
state
carry
war
from
one
end
of
the
world
to
the
other
make
laws
build
a
throne
but
that
he
can
not
force
lips
to
say
yes
when
the
heart
says
if
i
loved
you
said
amélie
in
a
tone
of
soft
reproach
it
is
midnight
you
are
here
in
my
room
i
weep
in
your
arms
i
the
daughter
of
general
de
montrevel
and
the
sister
of
roland
and
you
say
if
you
loved
i
was
wrong
i
was
wrong
my
darling
amélie
yes
i
know
that
you
were
brought
up
in
adoration
of
that
man
you
can
not
understand
that
any
one
should
resist
him
and
whoever
does
resist
him
is
a
rebel
in
your
charles
you
said
there
were
three
things
that
we
could
do
what
is
the
second
accept
apparently
the
marriage
they
propose
to
you
and
gain
time
by
delaying
under
various
pretexts
the
man
is
not
no
but
is
too
young
for
us
to
count
on
his
death
the
third
way
dear
friend
fly
but
that
is
a
last
resource
amélie
there
are
two
objections
first
your
i
am
yours
charles
i
will
surmount
my
and
added
the
young
man
my
your
engagements
my
companions
are
bound
to
me
amélie
but
i
too
am
bound
to
them
we
also
have
a
man
to
whom
we
have
sworn
obedience
that
man
is
the
future
king
of
france
if
you
accept
your
brother
s
devotion
to
bonaparte
accept
ours
to
louis
amélie
let
her
face
drop
into
her
hands
with
a
sigh
then
said
she
we
are
why
so
on
various
pretexts
your
health
above
all
you
can
gain
a
year
before
the
year
is
out
bonaparte
will
probably
be
forced
to
begin
another
war
in
italy
a
single
defeat
will
destroy
his
prestige
in
short
a
great
many
things
can
happen
in
a
did
you
read
roland
s
postscript
charles
yes
but
i
didn
t
see
anything
in
it
that
was
not
in
your
mother
s
read
the
last
sentence
and
amélie
placed
the
letter
before
him
he
read
i
am
leaving
paris
for
a
few
days
though
you
may
not
see
me
you
will
hear
of
me
well
do
you
know
what
that
means
it
means
that
roland
is
in
pursuit
of
what
does
that
matter
he
can
not
die
by
the
hand
of
any
of
but
you
unhappy
man
you
can
die
by
his
do
you
think
i
should
care
so
very
much
if
he
killed
me
amélie
oh
even
in
my
gloomiest
moments
i
never
thought
of
so
you
think
your
brother
is
on
the
hunt
for
us
i
am
sure
of
what
makes
you
so
certain
because
he
swore
over
sir
john
s
body
when
he
thought
him
dead
to
avenge
if
he
had
died
exclaimed
the
young
man
bitterly
we
should
not
be
where
we
are
god
saved
him
charles
it
was
therefore
good
that
he
did
not
for
us
i
can
not
fathom
the
ways
of
the
lord
i
tell
you
my
beloved
charles
beware
of
roland
roland
is
close
charles
smiled
incredulously
i
tell
you
that
he
is
not
only
near
here
but
he
has
been
he
has
been
seen
where
who
saw
him
who
saw
him
charlotte
my
maid
the
jailer
s
daughter
she
asked
permission
to
visit
her
parents
yesterday
sunday
you
were
coming
so
i
told
her
she
could
stay
till
this
well
she
therefore
spent
the
night
with
her
parents
at
eleven
o
clock
the
captain
of
the
gendarmerie
brought
in
some
prisoners
while
they
were
locking
them
up
a
man
wrapped
in
a
cloak
came
in
and
asked
for
the
captain
charlotte
thought
she
recognized
the
s
voice
she
looked
at
him
attentively
his
cloak
slipped
from
his
face
and
she
saw
that
it
was
my
the
young
man
made
a
movement
now
do
you
understand
charles
my
brother
comes
to
bourg
mysteriously
without
letting
me
know
he
asks
for
the
captain
of
the
gendarmerie
follows
him
into
the
prison
speaks
only
to
him
and
disappears
is
that
not
a
threatening
outlook
for
our
love
tell
me
charles
as
amélie
spoke
a
dark
cloud
spread
slowly
over
her
lover
s
face
amélie
said
he
when
my
companions
and
i
bound
ourselves
together
we
did
not
deceive
ourselves
as
to
the
risks
we
but
at
least
said
amélie
you
have
changed
your
place
of
refuge
you
have
abandoned
the
chartreuse
of
seillon
none
but
our
dead
are
there
is
the
grotto
of
ceyzeriat
perfectly
safe
as
safe
as
any
refuge
can
be
that
has
two
the
chartreuse
of
seillon
had
two
exits
yet
as
you
say
you
left
your
dead
the
dead
are
safer
than
the
living
they
are
sure
not
to
die
on
the
amélie
felt
a
shudder
go
through
her
charles
she
murmured
listen
said
the
young
man
god
is
my
witness
and
you
too
that
i
have
always
put
laughter
and
gayety
between
your
presentiments
and
my
fears
but
the
aspect
of
things
has
changed
we
are
coming
face
to
face
with
the
crisis
whatever
the
end
brings
us
it
is
approaching
i
do
not
ask
of
you
my
amélie
those
selfish
unreasonable
things
that
lovers
in
danger
of
death
exact
from
their
mistresses
i
do
not
ask
you
to
bind
your
heart
to
the
dead
your
love
to
a
corpse
friend
said
the
young
girl
laying
her
hand
on
his
arm
take
care
you
are
doubting
no
i
do
you
the
highest
honor
in
leaving
you
free
to
accomplish
the
sacrifice
to
its
full
extent
but
i
do
not
want
you
to
be
bound
by
an
oath
no
tie
shall
fetter
so
be
it
said
amélie
what
ask
of
you
continued
the
young
man
and
i
ask
you
to
swear
it
on
our
love
which
has
been
alas
so
fatal
to
you
is
this
if
i
am
arrested
and
disarmed
if
i
am
imprisoned
and
condemned
to
death
i
implore
you
amélie
i
exact
of
you
that
in
some
way
you
will
send
me
arms
not
only
for
myself
but
for
my
companions
also
so
that
we
may
still
be
masters
of
our
but
in
such
a
case
charles
may
i
not
tell
all
to
my
brother
may
i
not
appeal
to
his
tenderness
to
the
generosity
of
the
first
consul
before
the
young
girl
had
finished
her
lover
seized
her
violently
by
the
wrist
amélie
said
he
it
is
no
longer
one
promise
i
ask
of
you
there
are
two
swear
to
me
in
the
first
place
and
above
all
else
that
you
will
not
solicit
my
pardon
swear
it
amélie
swear
it
do
i
need
to
swear
dear
asked
the
young
girl
bursting
into
tears
i
promise
promise
it
on
the
hour
when
i
first
said
i
loved
you
on
the
hour
when
you
answered
that
i
was
loved
on
your
life
on
mine
on
the
past
on
the
future
on
our
smiles
on
our
i
should
die
in
any
case
you
see
amélie
even
though
i
had
to
beat
my
brains
out
against
the
wall
but
i
should
die
i
promise
you
then
for
my
second
request
amélie
if
we
are
taken
and
condemned
send
me
arms
arms
or
poison
the
means
of
dying
any
means
coming
from
you
death
would
be
another
far
or
near
free
or
a
prisoner
living
or
dead
you
are
my
master
i
am
your
slave
order
and
i
that
is
all
amélie
it
is
simple
and
clear

see
no
pardon
and
the
means
of
simple
and
clear
but
you
will
do
it
will
you
not
you
wish
me
to
i
implore
order
or
entreaty
charles
your
will
shall
be
the
young
man
held
the
girl
who
seemed
on
the
verge
of
fainting
in
his
left
arm
and
approached
his
mouth
to
hers
but
just
as
their
lips
were
about
to
touch
an
owl
s
cry
was
heard
so
close
to
the
window
that
amélie
started
and
charles
raised
his
head
the
cry
was
repeated
a
second
time
and
then
a
third
ah
murmured
amélie
do
you
hear
that
bird
of
we
are
doomed
my
but
charles
shook
his
head
that
is
not
an
owl
amélie
he
said
it
is
the
call
of
our
companions
put
out
the
amélie
blew
it
out
while
her
lover
opened
the
window
even
here
she
murmured
they
seek
you
even
here
it
is
our
friend
and
confidant
the
comte
de
jayat
no
one
else
knows
where
i
then
leaning
from
the
balcony
he
asked
is
it
you
montbar
yes
is
that
you
morgan
a
man
came
from
behind
a
clump
of
trees
news
from
paris
not
an
instant
to
lose
a
matter
of
life
and
death
to
us
do
you
hear
amélie
taking
the
young
girl
in
his
arms
he
pressed
her
convulsively
to
his
heart
go
she
said
in
a
faint
voice
go
did
you
not
hear
him
say
it
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
for
all
of
you
farewell
my
amélie
my
beloved
farewell
oh
don
t
say
no
no
au
revoir
morgan
morgan
cried
the
voice
of
the
man
waiting
below
in
the
garden
the
young
man
pressed
his
lips
once
more
to
amélie
s
then
rushing
to
the
window
he
sprang
over
the
balcony
at
a
bound
and
joined
his
friend
amélie
gave
a
cry
and
ran
to
the
balustrade
but
all
she
saw
was
two
moving
shadows
entering
the
deepening
shadows
of
the
fine
old
trees
that
adorned
the
park
chapter
xxxix
the
grotto
of
ceyzeriat
the
two
young
men
plunged
into
the
shadow
of
the
trees
morgan
guided
his
companion
less
familiar
than
he
with
the
windings
of
the
park
until
they
reached
the
exact
spot
where
he
was
in
the
habit
of
scaling
the
wall
it
took
but
an
instant
for
both
of
them
to
accomplish
that
feat
the
next
moment
they
were
on
the
banks
of
the
reissouse
a
boat
was
fastened
to
the
foot
of
a
willow
they
jumped
into
it
and
three
strokes
of
the
oar
brought
them
to
the
other
side
there
a
path
led
along
the
bank
of
the
river
to
a
little
wood
which
extends
from
ceyzeriat
to
etrez
a
distance
of
about
nine
miles
and
thus
forms
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
a
pendant
to
the
forest
of
seillon
on
reaching
the
edge
of
the
wood
they
stopped
until
then
they
had
been
walking
as
rapidly
as
it
was
possible
to
do
without
running
and
neither
of
them
had
uttered
a
word
the
whole
way
was
deserted
it
was
probable
in
fact
certain
that
no
one
had
seen
them
they
could
breathe
freely
where
are
the
companions
asked
morgan
in
the
grotto
replied
montbar
why
don
t
we
go
there
at
once
because
we
shall
find
one
of
them
at
the
foot
of
that
beech
who
will
tell
us
if
we
can
go
further
without
which
one
d
a
shadow
came
from
behind
the
tree
here
i
am
it
said
ah
there
you
are
exclaimed
the
two
young
men
anything
new
inquired
montbar
nothing
they
are
waiting
for
you
to
come
to
a
in
that
case
let
us
the
three
young
men
continued
on
their
way
after
going
about
three
hundred
yards
montbar
stopped
again
and
said
softly
armand
the
dry
leaves
rustled
at
the
call
and
a
fourth
shadow
stepped
from
behind
a
clump
of
trees
and
approached
his
companions
anything
new
asked
montbar
yes
a
messenger
from
the
same
one
who
came
before
where
is
he
with
the
brothers
in
the
montbar
rushed
on
ahead
the
path
had
grown
so
narrow
that
the
four
young
men
could
only
walk
in
single
file
it
rose
for
about
five
hundred
paces
with
an
easy
but
winding
slope
coming
to
an
opening
montbar
stopped
and
gave
three
times
the
same
owl
s
cry
with
which
he
had
called
morgan
a
single
hoot
answered
him
then
a
man
slid
down
from
the
branches
of
a
bushy
oak
it
was
the
sentinel
who
guarded
the
entrance
to
the
grotto
which
was
not
more
than
thirty
feet
from
the
oak
the
position
of
the
trees
surrounding
it
made
it
almost
impossible
of
detection
the
sentinel
exchanged
a
few
whispered
words
with
montbar
who
seemed
by
fulfilling
the
duties
of
leader
desirous
of
leaving
morgan
entirely
to
his
thoughts
then
as
his
watch
was
probably
not
over
the
bandit
climbed
the
oak
again
and
was
soon
so
completely
blended
with
the
body
of
the
tree
that
those
he
had
left
might
have
looked
for
him
in
vain
in
that
aerial
bastion
the
glade
became
narrower
as
they
neared
the
entrance
to
the
grotto
montbar
reached
it
first
and
from
a
known
to
him
he
took
a
flint
a
steel
some
tinder
matches
and
a
torch
the
sparks
flew
the
tinder
caught
fire
the
match
cast
a
quivering
bluish
flame
to
which
succeeded
the
crackling
resinous
flames
of
the
torch
three
or
four
paths
were
then
visible
montbar
took
one
without
hesitation
the
path
sank
winding
into
the
earth
and
turned
back
upon
itself
as
if
the
young
men
were
retracing
their
steps
underground
along
the
path
that
had
brought
them
it
was
evident
that
they
were
following
the
windings
of
an
ancient
quarry
probably
the
one
from
which
were
built
nineteen
hundred
years
earlier
the
three
roman
towns
which
are
now
mere
villages
and
cæsar
s
camp
which
overlooked
them
at
intervals
this
subterraneous
path
was
cut
entirely
across
by
a
deep
ditch
impassable
except
with
the
aid
of
a
plank
that
could
with
a
kick
be
precipitated
into
the
hollow
beneath
also
from
place
to
place
breastworks
could
still
be
seen
behind
which
men
could
intrench
themselves
and
fire
without
exposing
their
persons
to
the
sight
or
fire
of
the
enemy
finally
at
five
hundred
yards
from
the
entrance
a
barricade
of
the
height
of
a
man
presented
a
final
obstacle
to
those
who
sought
to
enter
a
circular
space
in
which
ten
or
a
dozen
men
were
now
seated
or
lying
around
some
reading
others
playing
cards
neither
the
readers
nor
the
players
moved
at
the
noise
made
by
the
or
at
the
gleam
of
their
light
playing
upon
the
walls
of
the
quarry
so
certain
were
they
that
none
but
friends
could
reach
this
spot
guarded
as
it
was
for
the
rest
the
scene
of
this
encampment
was
extremely
picturesque
wax
candles
were
burning
in
profusion
the
companions
of
jehu
were
too
aristocratic
to
make
use
of
any
other
light
and
cast
their
reflection
upon
stands
of
arms
of
all
kinds
among
which
muskets
and
pistols
held
first
place
foils
and
masks
were
hanging
here
and
there
upon
the
walls
several
musical
instruments
were
lying
about
and
a
few
mirrors
in
gilt
frames
proclaimed
the
fact
that
dress
was
a
pastime
by
no
means
unappreciated
by
the
strange
inhabitants
of
that
subterranean
dwelling
they
all
seemed
as
tranquil
as
though
the
news
which
had
drawn
morgan
from
amélie
s
arms
was
unknown
to
them
or
considered
of
no
importance
nevertheless
when
the
little
group
from
outside
approached
and
the
words
the
captain
the
captain
were
heard
all
rose
not
with
the
servility
of
soldiers
toward
their
approaching
chief
but
with
the
affectionate
deference
of
strong
and
intelligent
men
for
one
stronger
and
more
intelligent
than
they
then
morgan
shook
his
head
raised
his
eyes
and
passing
before
montbar
advanced
to
the
centre
of
the
circle
which
had
formed
at
his
appearance
and
said
well
friends
it
seems
you
have
had
some
yes
captain
answered
a
voice
the
police
of
the
first
consul
does
us
the
honor
to
be
interested
in
where
is
the
messenger
asked
morgan
here
replied
a
young
man
wearing
the
livery
of
a
cabinet
courier
who
was
still
covered
with
mud
and
dust
have
you
any
despatches
written
no
verbal
where
do
they
come
from
the
private
office
of
the
minister
of
can
they
be
trusted
i
ll
answer
for
them
they
are
positively
it
s
a
good
thing
to
have
friends
everywhere
observed
montbar
parenthetically
especially
near
fouché
resumed
morgan
let
us
hear
the
am
i
to
tell
it
aloud
or
to
you
privately
i
presume
we
are
all
interested
so
tell
it
well
the
first
consul
sent
for
citizen
fouché
at
the
louvre
and
lectured
him
on
our
capital
what
next
citizen
fouché
replied
that
we
were
clever
scamps
very
difficult
to
find
and
still
more
difficult
to
capture
when
we
had
been
found
in
short
he
praised
us
very
amiable
of
him
what
next
next
the
first
consul
replied
that
that
did
not
concern
him
that
we
were
brigands
and
that
it
was
our
brigandage
which
maintained
the
war
in
vendée
and
that
the
day
we
ceased
sending
money
to
brittany
there
would
be
no
more
excellent
reasoning
it
seems
to
he
said
the
west
must
be
fought
in
the
east
and
the
like
england
in
consequently
he
gave
citizen
fouché
full
powers
and
even
if
it
cost
a
million
and
he
had
to
kill
five
hundred
men
he
must
have
our
well
he
knows
his
man
when
he
makes
his
demand
remains
to
be
seen
if
we
let
him
have
so
citizen
fouché
went
home
furious
and
vowed
that
before
eight
days
passed
there
should
not
be
a
single
companion
of
jehu
left
in
the
time
is
that
same
day
couriers
started
for
lyons
mâcon
besançon
and
geneva
with
orders
to
the
garrison
commanders
to
do
personally
all
they
could
for
our
destruction
but
above
all
to
obey
unquestioningly
roland
de
montrevel
to
the
first
consul
and
to
put
at
his
disposal
as
many
troops
as
he
thought
and
i
can
add
said
morgan
that
roland
de
montrevel
is
already
in
the
field
he
had
a
conference
with
the
captain
of
the
gendarmerie
in
the
prison
at
bourg
does
any
one
know
why
asked
a
voice
the
deuce
said
another
to
engage
our
do
you
still
mean
to
protect
him
asked
d
assas
more
than
ah
that
s
too
much
muttered
a
voice
why
so
retorted
morgan
imperiously
isn
t
it
my
right
as
a
companion
certainly
said
two
other
voices
then
i
use
it
both
as
a
companion
and
as
your
but
suppose
in
the
middle
of
the
fray
a
stray
ball
should
take
him
said
a
voice
then
it
is
not
a
right
i
claim
nor
an
order
that
i
give
but
an
entreaty
i
make
my
friends
promise
me
on
your
honor
that
the
life
of
roland
de
montrevel
will
be
sacred
to
with
unanimous
voice
all
stretching
out
their
hands
they
replied
we
swear
on
our
honor
now
resumed
morgan
let
us
look
at
our
position
under
its
true
aspect
without
deluding
ourselves
in
any
way
once
an
intelligent
police
force
starts
out
to
pursue
us
and
makes
actual
war
against
us
it
will
be
impossible
for
us
to
resist
we
may
trick
them
like
a
fox
or
double
like
a
boar
but
our
resistance
will
be
merely
a
matter
of
time
that
s
all
at
least
that
is
my
morgan
questioned
his
companions
with
his
eyes
and
their
acquiescence
was
unanimous
though
it
was
with
a
smile
on
their
lips
that
they
recognized
their
doom
but
that
was
the
way
in
those
strange
days
men
went
to
their
death
without
fear
and
they
dealt
it
to
others
without
emotion
and
now
asked
montbar
have
you
anything
further
to
say
yes
replied
morgan
i
have
to
add
that
nothing
is
easier
than
to
procure
horses
or
even
to
escape
on
foot
we
are
all
hunters
and
more
or
less
mountaineers
it
will
take
us
six
hours
on
horse
back
to
get
out
of
france
or
twelve
on
foot
once
in
switzerland
we
can
snap
our
fingers
at
citizen
fouché
and
his
police
that
s
all
i
have
to
it
would
be
very
amusing
to
laugh
at
citizen
fouché
said
montbar
but
very
dull
to
leave
for
that
reason
i
shall
not
put
this
extreme
measure
to
a
vote
until
after
we
have
talked
with
cadoudal
s
ah
true
exclaimed
two
or
three
voices
the
breton
where
is
the
breton
he
was
asleep
when
i
left
said
montbar
and
he
is
still
sleeping
said
adler
pointing
to
a
man
lying
on
a
heap
of
straw
in
a
recess
of
the
grotto
they
wakened
the
breton
who
rose
to
his
knees
rubbing
his
eyes
with
one
hand
and
feeling
for
his
carbine
with
the
other
you
are
with
friends
said
a
voice
don
t
be
afraid
said
the
breton
who
are
you
over
there
who
thinks
i
am
afraid
some
one
who
probably
does
not
know
what
fear
is
my
dear
or
said
morgan
who
recognized
in
cadoudal
s
messenger
the
same
man
whom
they
had
received
at
the
chartreuse
the
night
he
himself
arrived
from
avignon
i
ask
pardon
on
his
or
looked
at
the
young
men
before
him
with
an
air
that
left
no
doubt
of
his
repugnance
for
a
certain
sort
of
pleasantry
but
as
the
group
had
evidently
no
offensive
intention
their
gayety
having
no
insolence
about
it
he
said
with
a
tolerably
gracious
air
which
of
you
gentlemen
is
captain
i
have
a
letter
for
him
from
my
morgan
advanced
a
step
and
said
i
your
name
i
have
your
fighting
name
yes
that
s
the
one
the
general
told
me
besides
i
recognize
you
you
gave
me
a
bag
containing
sixty
thousand
francs
the
night
i
saw
the
monks
the
letter
is
for
you
give
it
to
the
peasant
took
off
his
hat
pulled
out
the
lining
and
from
between
it
and
the
felt
he
took
a
piece
of
paper
which
resembled
another
lining
and
seemed
at
first
sight
to
be
blank
then
with
a
military
salute
he
offered
the
paper
to
morgan
who
turned
it
over
and
over
and
could
see
no
writing
at
least
none
was
apparent
a
candle
he
said
they
brought
a
wax
light
morgan
held
the
paper
to
the
flame
little
by
little
as
the
paper
warmed
the
writing
appeared
the
experience
appeared
familiar
to
the
young
men
the
breton
alone
seemed
surprised
to
his
naive
mind
the
operation
probably
seemed
like
witchcraft
but
so
long
as
the
devil
was
aiding
the
royalist
cause
the
chouan
was
willing
to
deal
with
him
gentlemen
said
morgan
do
you
want
to
know
what
the
master
says
all
bowed
and
listened
while
the
young
man
read
my
dear
morgan
if
you
hear
that
i
have
abandoned
the
cause
and
am
in
treaty
with
the
government
of
the
first
consul
and
the
vendéan
leaders
do
not
believe
it
i
am
a
breton
of
brittany
and
consequently
as
stubborn
as
a
true
breton
the
first
consul
sent
one
of
his
to
offer
me
an
amnesty
for
all
my
men
and
the
rank
of
colonel
for
myself
i
have
not
even
consulted
my
men
i
refused
for
them
and
for
me
now
all
depends
on
us
as
we
receive
from
the
princes
neither
money
nor
encouragement
you
are
our
only
treasurer
close
your
coffers
or
rather
cease
to
open
those
of
the
government
for
us
and
the
royalist
opposition
the
heart
of
which
beats
only
in
brittany
will
subside
little
by
little
and
end
before
long
i
need
not
tell
you
that
my
life
will
have
ended
first
our
mission
is
dangerous
probably
it
will
cost
us
our
heads
but
what
can
be
more
glorious
than
to
hear
posterity
say
of
us
if
one
can
hear
beyond
the
grave
all
others
despaired
but
they
never
one
of
us
will
survive
the
other
but
only
to
succumb
later
let
that
survivor
say
as
he
dies
omnes
ego
count
on
me
as
i
count
on
you
cadoudal
you
know
that
you
can
safely
give
or
all
the
money
you
have
for
the
cause
he
has
promised
me
not
to
let
himself
be
taken
and
i
trust
his
word
a
murmur
of
enthusiasm
ran
through
the
group
as
morgan
finished
the
last
words
of
the
letter
you
have
heard
it
gentlemen
he
said
yes
yes
yes
repeated
every
voice
in
the
first
place
how
much
money
have
we
to
give
to
or
thirteen
thousand
francs
from
the
lake
of
silans
thousand
from
les
carronnières
fourteen
thousand
from
meximieux
thousand
in
all
said
one
of
the
group
you
hear
or
said
morgan
it
is
not
much
only
half
what
we
gave
you
last
time
but
you
know
the
proverb
the
handsomest
girl
in
the
world
can
only
give
what
she
the
general
knows
what
you
risk
to
obtain
this
money
and
he
says
that
no
matter
how
little
you
send
he
will
receive
it
all
the
more
that
the
next
will
be
better
said
a
young
man
who
had
just
joined
the
group
unperceived
so
absorbed
were
all
present
in
cadoudal
s
letter
more
especially
if
we
say
two
words
to
the
from
chambéry
next
ah
is
that
you
valensolle
said
morgan
no
real
names
if
you
please
baron
let
us
be
shot
guillotined
drawn
and
quartered
but
save
our
family
honor
my
name
is
adler
i
answer
to
no
pardon
me
i
did
wrong
you
were
saying
that
the
from
paris
to
chambéry
will
pass
through
and
belleville
next
saturday
carrying
fifty
thousand
francs
of
government
money
to
the
monks
of
to
which
i
may
add
that
there
is
between
those
two
places
a
spot
called
the
which
seems
to
me
admirably
adapted
for
an
what
do
you
say
gentlemen
asked
morgan
shall
we
do
citizen
fouché
the
honor
to
worry
about
his
police
shall
we
leave
france
or
shall
we
still
remain
faithful
companions
of
jehu
there
was
but
one
reply
we
right
said
morgan
brothers
i
recognize
you
there
cadoudal
points
out
our
duty
in
that
admirable
letter
we
have
just
received
let
us
adopt
his
heroic
motto
omnes
ego
then
addressing
the
peasant
he
said
or
the
thousand
francs
are
at
your
disposal
you
can
start
when
you
like
promise
something
better
next
time
in
our
name
and
tell
the
general
for
me
that
wherever
he
goes
even
though
it
be
to
the
scaffold
i
shall
deem
it
an
honor
to
follow
or
to
precede
him
au
revoir
then
turning
to
the
young
man
who
seemed
so
anxious
to
preserve
his
incognito
my
dear
adler
he
said
like
a
man
who
has
recovered
his
gayety
lost
for
an
instant
i
undertake
to
feed
and
lodge
you
this
night
if
you
will
deign
to
accept
me
as
a
gratefully
friend
morgan
replied
the
only
let
me
tell
you
that
i
could
do
without
a
bed
for
i
am
dropping
with
fatigue
but
not
without
supper
for
i
am
dying
of
you
shall
have
a
good
bed
and
an
excellent
where
must
i
go
for
follow
i
m
then
come
on
gentlemen
are
you
on
watch
montbar
then
we
can
sleep
in
so
saying
morgan
passed
his
arm
through
that
of
his
friend
took
a
torch
in
his
other
hand
and
passed
into
the
depths
of
the
grotto
where
we
will
follow
him
if
our
readers
are
not
too
weary
of
this
long
session
it
was
the
first
time
that
valensolle
who
came
as
we
have
said
from
the
neighborhood
of
aix
had
had
occasion
to
visit
the
grotto
of
ceyzeriat
recently
adopted
as
the
of
the
companions
of
jehu
at
the
preceding
meetings
he
had
occasion
to
explore
only
the
windings
and
intricacies
of
the
chartreuse
of
seillon
which
he
now
knew
so
well
that
in
the
farce
played
before
roland
the
part
of
ghost
was
intrusted
to
him
everything
was
therefore
curious
and
unknown
to
him
in
this
new
domicile
where
he
now
expected
to
take
his
first
sleep
and
which
seemed
likely
to
be
for
some
days
at
least
morgan
s
headquarters
as
is
always
the
case
in
abandoned
quarries
which
at
the
first
glance
partake
somewhat
of
the
character
of
subterranean
cities
the
different
galleries
excavated
by
the
removal
of
the
stone
end
in
a
cul
de
sac
that
is
to
say
at
a
point
in
the
mine
where
the
work
stops
one
of
these
streets
seemed
to
prolong
itself
indefinitely
nevertheless
there
came
a
point
where
the
mine
would
naturally
have
ended
but
there
in
the
angle
of
the
tunnelled
way
was
cut
for
what
purpose
the
thing
remains
a
mystery
to
this
day
among
the
people
of
the
neigbborhood
an
opening
the
width
of
the
gallery
wide
enough
or
nearly
so
to
give
passage
to
two
men
abreast
the
two
friends
passed
through
this
opening
the
air
there
became
so
rarefied
that
their
torch
threatened
to
go
out
at
every
step
vallensolle
felt
drops
of
water
falling
on
his
hands
and
face
bless
me
said
he
does
it
rain
down
here
no
replied
morgan
laughing
only
we
are
passing
under
the
then
we
are
going
to
bourg
that
s
about
all
right
you
are
leading
me
you
have
promised
me
supper
and
a
bed
so
i
have
nothing
to
worry
about
unless
that
light
goes
out
added
the
young
man
looking
at
the
paling
flame
of
the
torch
that
wouldn
t
matter
we
can
always
find
ourselves
in
the
end
said
valensolle
and
when
one
reflects
that
we
are
wandering
through
a
grotto
under
rivers
at
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
sleeping
the
lord
knows
where
with
the
prospect
of
being
taken
tried
and
guillotined
some
fine
morning
and
all
for
princes
who
don
t
even
know
our
names
and
who
if
they
did
know
them
one
day
would
forget
them
the
next
i
tell
you
morgan
it
s
stupid
my
dear
fellow
said
morgan
what
we
call
stupid
what
ordinary
minds
never
do
understand
in
such
a
case
has
many
a
chance
to
become
well
well
said
valensolle
i
see
that
you
will
lose
more
than
i
do
in
this
business
i
put
devotion
into
it
but
you
put
morgan
sighed
here
we
are
said
he
letting
the
conversation
drop
like
a
burden
too
heavy
to
be
carried
longer
in
fact
his
foot
had
just
struck
against
the
first
step
of
a
stairway
preceding
valensolle
for
whom
he
lighted
the
way
morgan
went
up
ten
steps
and
reached
the
gate
taking
a
key
from
his
pocket
he
opened
it
they
found
themselves
in
the
burial
vault
on
each
side
of
the
vault
stood
coffins
on
iron
tripods
ducal
crowns
and
escutcheons
blazoned
azure
with
the
cross
argent
indicated
that
these
coffins
belonged
to
the
family
of
savoy
before
it
came
to
bear
the
royal
crown
a
flight
of
stairs
at
the
further
end
of
the
cavern
led
to
an
upper
floor
valensolle
cast
a
curious
glance
around
him
and
by
the
vacillating
light
of
the
torch
he
recognized
the
funereal
place
he
was
in
the
devil
said
he
we
are
just
the
reverse
of
the
spartans
it
inasmuch
as
they
were
republicans
and
we
are
royalists
asked
morgan
no
because
they
had
skeletons
at
the
end
of
their
suppers
and
we
have
ours
at
the
are
you
sure
it
was
the
spartans
who
proved
their
philosophy
in
that
way
asked
morgan
closing
the
door
they
or
others
what
matter
said
vallensolle
faith
my
citation
is
made
and
like
the
abbé
vertot
who
wouldn
t
rewrite
his
siege
i
ll
not
change
well
another
time
you
had
better
say
the
well
said
valensolle
with
an
indifference
that
was
not
without
a
certain
sadness
i
ll
probably
be
a
skeleton
myself
before
i
have
another
chance
to
display
my
erudition
but
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
why
did
you
put
out
the
torch
you
re
not
going
to
make
me
eat
and
sleep
here
i
hope
morgan
had
in
fact
extinguished
the
torch
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
leading
to
the
upper
floor
give
me
your
hand
said
the
young
man
valensolle
seized
his
friend
s
band
with
an
eagerness
that
showed
how
very
slight
a
desire
he
had
to
make
a
longer
stay
in
the
gloomy
vaults
of
the
dukes
of
savoy
no
matter
what
honor
there
might
be
in
such
illustrious
companionship
morgan
went
up
the
steps
then
by
the
tightening
of
his
hand
valensolle
knew
he
was
making
an
effort
presently
a
stone
was
raised
and
through
the
opening
a
trembling
gleam
of
twilight
met
the
eyes
of
the
young
men
and
a
fragrant
aromatic
odor
came
to
comfort
their
sense
of
smell
after
the
mephitic
atmosphere
of
the
vaults
ah
cried
valensolle
we
are
in
a
barn
i
prefer
morgan
did
not
answer
he
helped
his
companion
to
climb
out
of
the
vault
and
then
let
the
stone
drop
back
in
its
place
valensolle
looked
about
him
he
was
in
the
midst
of
a
vast
building
filled
with
hay
into
which
the
light
filtered
through
windows
of
such
exquisite
form
that
they
certainly
could
not
be
those
of
a
barn
why
said
valensolle
we
are
not
in
a
barn
climb
up
the
hay
and
sit
down
near
that
window
replied
morgan
valensolle
obeyed
and
scrambled
up
the
hay
like
a
schoolboy
in
his
holidays
then
he
sat
down
as
morgan
had
told
him
before
a
window
the
next
moment
morgan
placed
between
his
friend
s
legs
a
napkin
containing
a
paté
bread
a
bottle
of
wine
two
glasses
two
knives
and
two
forks
the
deuce
cried
valensolle
lucullus
sups
with
then
gazing
through
the
panes
at
a
building
with
numberless
windows
which
seemed
to
be
a
wing
of
the
one
they
were
in
and
before
which
a
sentry
was
pacing
he
exclaimed
positively
i
can
t
eat
my
supper
till
i
know
where
we
are
what
is
this
building
and
why
that
sentry
at
the
door
well
said
morgan
since
you
absolutely
must
know
i
will
tell
you
we
are
in
the
church
of
brou
which
was
converted
into
a
fodder
storehouse
by
a
decree
of
the
municipal
council
that
adjoining
building
is
now
the
barracks
of
the
gendarmerie
and
that
sentry
is
posted
to
prevent
any
one
from
disturbing
our
supper
or
surprising
us
while
we
brave
fellows
said
valensolle
filling
his
glass
their
health
morgan
and
ours
said
the
young
man
laughing
the
devil
take
me
if
any
one
could
dream
of
finding
us
morgan
had
hardly
drained
his
glass
when
as
if
the
devil
had
accepted
the
challenge
the
sentinel
s
harsh
strident
voice
cried
vive
hey
exclaimed
the
two
young
men
what
does
this
mean
a
body
of
thirty
men
came
from
the
direction
of
pont
d
ain
and
after
giving
the
countersign
to
the
sentry
at
once
dispersed
the
larger
number
led
by
two
men
who
seemed
to
be
officers
entered
the
barracks
the
others
continued
on
their
way
attention
said
morgan
and
both
young
men
on
their
knees
their
ears
alert
their
eyes
at
the
window
waited
let
us
now
explain
to
the
reader
the
cause
of
this
interruption
of
a
repast
which
though
taken
at
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
was
not
as
we
have
seen
chapter
xl
a
false
scent
the
jailer
s
daughter
had
not
been
mistaken
it
was
indeed
roland
whom
she
had
seen
in
the
jail
speaking
to
the
captain
of
the
gendarmerie
neither
was
amélie
wrong
in
her
terror
roland
was
really
in
pursuit
of
morgan
although
he
avoided
going
to
the
château
des
it
was
not
that
he
had
the
slightest
suspicion
of
the
interest
his
sister
had
in
the
leader
of
the
companions
of
jehu
but
he
feared
the
indiscretion
of
one
of
his
servants
he
had
recognized
charlotte
at
the
jail
but
as
the
girl
showed
no
astonishment
he
believed
she
had
not
recognized
him
all
the
more
because
after
exchanging
a
few
words
with
the
captain
he
went
out
to
wait
for
the
latter
on
the
place
du
bastion
which
was
always
deserted
at
that
hour
his
duties
over
the
captain
of
gendarmerie
joined
him
he
found
roland
impatiently
walking
back
and
forth
roland
had
merely
made
himself
known
at
the
jail
but
here
he
proceeded
to
explain
the
matter
and
to
initiate
the
captain
into
the
object
of
his
visit
roland
had
solicited
the
first
consul
as
a
favor
to
himself
that
the
pursuit
of
the
companions
of
jehu
be
intrusted
to
him
personally
a
favor
he
had
obtained
without
difficulty
an
order
from
the
minister
of
war
placed
at
his
disposal
not
only
the
garrison
of
bourg
but
also
those
of
the
neighboring
towns
an
order
from
the
minister
of
police
enjoined
all
the
officers
of
the
gendarmerie
to
render
him
every
assistance
he
naturally
applied
in
the
first
instance
to
the
captain
of
the
gendarmerie
at
bourg
whom
he
had
long
known
personally
as
a
man
of
great
courage
and
executive
ability
he
found
what
he
wanted
in
him
the
captain
was
furious
against
the
companions
of
jehu
who
had
stopped
diligences
within
a
mile
of
his
town
and
on
whom
he
was
unable
to
lay
his
hand
he
knew
of
the
reports
relating
to
the
last
three
stoppages
that
had
been
sent
to
the
minister
of
police
and
he
understood
the
latter
s
anger
but
roland
brought
his
amazement
to
a
climax
when
he
told
him
of
the
night
he
had
spent
at
the
chartreuse
of
seillon
and
of
what
had
happened
to
sir
john
at
that
same
chartreuse
during
the
succeeding
night
the
captain
had
heard
by
common
rumor
that
madame
de
montrevel
s
guest
had
been
stabbed
but
as
no
one
had
lodged
a
complaint
he
did
not
think
he
had
the
right
to
investigate
circumstances
which
it
seemed
to
him
roland
wished
to
keep
in
the
dark
in
those
troublous
days
more
indulgence
was
shown
to
officers
of
the
army
than
they
might
have
received
at
other
times
as
for
roland
he
had
said
nothing
because
he
wished
to
reserve
for
himself
the
satisfaction
of
pursuing
the
assassins
and
sham
ghosts
of
the
chartreuse
when
the
time
came
he
now
arrived
with
full
power
to
put
that
design
into
execution
firmly
resolved
not
to
return
to
the
first
consul
until
it
was
accomplished
besides
it
was
one
of
those
adventures
he
was
always
seeking
at
once
dangerous
and
picturesque
an
opportunity
of
pitting
his
life
against
men
who
cared
little
for
their
own
and
probably
less
for
his
roland
had
no
conception
of
morgan
s
which
had
twice
protected
him
from
danger
once
on
the
night
he
had
watched
at
the
chartreuse
and
again
when
he
had
fought
against
cadoudal
how
could
he
know
that
a
simple
cross
was
drawn
above
his
name
and
that
this
symbol
of
redemption
guaranteed
his
safety
from
one
end
of
france
to
the
other
for
the
rest
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
surround
the
chartreuse
of
seillon
and
to
search
thoroughly
into
its
most
secret
places
a
thing
roland
believed
himself
perfectly
competent
to
do
the
night
was
now
too
far
advanced
to
undertake
the
expedition
and
it
was
postponed
until
the
one
following
in
the
meantime
roland
remained
quietly
in
hiding
in
the
captain
s
room
at
the
barracks
that
no
one
might
suspect
his
presence
at
bourg
nor
its
cause
the
following
night
he
was
to
guide
the
expedition
in
the
course
of
the
morrow
one
of
the
gendarmes
who
was
a
tailor
agreed
to
make
him
a
sergeant
s
uniform
he
was
to
pass
as
a
member
of
the
brigade
at
and
thanks
to
the
uniform
could
direct
the
search
at
the
chartreuse
without
being
recognized
everything
happened
as
planned
roland
entered
the
barracks
with
the
captain
about
one
o
clock
ascended
to
the
latter
s
room
where
he
slept
on
a
bed
on
the
floor
like
a
man
who
has
just
passed
two
days
and
two
nights
in
a
the
next
day
he
restrained
his
impatience
by
drawing
a
plan
of
the
chartreuse
of
seillon
for
the
captain
s
instruction
with
which
even
without
roland
s
help
that
worthy
officer
could
have
directed
the
expedition
without
going
an
inch
astray
as
the
captain
had
but
eighteen
men
under
him
and
it
was
not
possible
to
surround
the
monastery
completely
with
that
number
or
rather
to
guard
the
two
exits
and
make
a
thorough
search
through
the
interior
and
as
it
would
have
taken
three
or
four
days
to
bring
in
all
the
men
of
the
brigade
scattered
throughout
the
neighborhood
the
officer
by
roland
s
order
went
to
the
colonel
of
dragoons
garrisoned
at
bourg
told
him
of
the
matter
in
hand
and
asked
for
twelve
men
who
with
his
own
made
thirty
in
all
the
colonel
not
only
granted
the
twelve
men
but
learning
that
the
expedition
was
to
be
commanded
by
colonel
roland
de
montrevel
to
the
first
consul
he
proposed
that
he
himself
should
join
the
party
at
the
head
of
his
twelve
men
roland
accepted
his
and
it
was
agreed
that
the
colonel
we
employ
the
words
colonel
and
chief
of
brigade
indifferently
both
being
interchangeable
terms
indicating
the
same
rank
and
his
twelve
dragoons
should
pick
up
roland
the
captain
and
his
eighteen
men
the
barracks
being
directly
on
their
road
to
the
chartreuse
the
time
was
set
for
eleven
that
night
at
eleven
precisely
with
military
punctuality
the
colonel
of
dragoons
and
his
twelve
men
joined
the
gendarmes
and
the
two
companies
now
united
in
one
began
their
march
roland
in
his
sergeant
s
uniform
made
himself
known
to
his
brother
colonel
but
to
the
dragoons
and
gendarmes
he
remained
as
agreed
upon
a
sergeant
detached
from
the
brigade
at
only
as
it
might
otherwise
have
seemed
extraordinary
that
a
sergeant
wholly
unfamiliar
with
these
localities
should
be
their
guide
the
men
were
told
that
roland
had
been
in
his
youth
a
novice
at
seillon
and
was
therefore
better
acquainted
than
most
persons
with
the
mysterious
nooks
of
the
chartreuse
the
first
feeling
of
these
brave
soldiers
had
been
a
slight
humiliation
at
being
guided
by
an
but
on
the
other
hand
as
that
wore
the
hat
jauntily
and
as
his
whole
manner
and
appearance
was
that
of
a
man
who
has
completely
forgotten
that
he
formerly
wore
a
cowl
they
ended
by
accepting
the
humiliation
and
reserved
their
final
judgment
on
the
sergeant
until
they
could
see
how
he
handled
the
musket
he
carried
on
his
arm
the
pistols
he
wore
in
his
belt
and
the
sword
that
hung
at
his
side
the
party
was
supplied
with
torches
and
started
in
perfect
silence
they
were
divided
into
three
squads
one
of
eight
men
led
by
the
captain
of
gendarmerie
another
of
ten
commanded
by
the
colonel
and
the
third
of
twelve
men
with
roland
at
its
head
on
leaving
the
town
they
separated
the
captain
of
the
gendarmerie
who
knew
the
localities
better
than
the
colonel
of
dragoons
took
upon
himself
to
guard
the
window
of
la
correrie
giving
upon
the
forest
of
seillon
with
his
eight
men
the
colonel
of
dragoons
was
commissioned
by
roland
to
watch
the
main
entrance
of
the
chartreuse
with
him
were
five
gendarmes
and
five
dragoons
roland
was
to
search
the
interior
taking
with
him
five
gendarmes
and
seven
dragoons
half
an
hour
was
allowed
each
squad
to
reach
its
post
it
was
more
than
was
needed
roland
and
his
men
were
to
scale
the
orchard
wall
when
eleven
was
ringing
from
the
belfry
at
péronnaz
the
captain
of
gendarmerie
followed
the
main
road
from
pont
d
ain
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
which
he
skirted
until
he
reached
his
appointed
station
the
colonel
of
dragoons
took
the
crossroad
which
branches
from
the
highway
of
pont
d
ain
and
leads
to
the
great
portal
of
the
chartreuse
roland
crossed
the
fields
to
the
orchard
wall
which
as
the
reader
will
remember
he
had
already
climbed
on
two
occasions
punctually
at
eleven
he
gave
the
signal
to
his
men
to
scale
the
wall
by
the
time
they
reached
the
other
side
the
men
if
they
did
not
yet
know
that
roland
was
brave
were
at
least
sure
that
he
was
active
roland
pointed
in
the
dusk
to
a
door
the
one
that
led
from
the
orchard
into
the
cloister
then
he
sprang
ahead
through
the
rank
grasses
first
he
opened
the
door
first
he
entered
the
cloister
all
was
dark
silent
and
solitary
roland
still
guiding
his
men
reached
the
refectory
absolute
solitude
utter
silence
they
crossed
the
hall
obliquely
and
returned
to
the
garden
without
alarming
a
living
creature
except
the
owls
and
the
bats
there
still
remained
the
cistern
the
mortuary
vault
and
the
pavilion
or
rather
the
chapel
in
the
forest
to
be
searched
roland
crossed
the
open
space
between
the
cistern
and
the
monastery
after
descending
the
steps
he
lighted
three
torches
kept
one
and
handed
the
other
two
one
to
a
dragoon
the
other
to
a
gendarme
then
he
raised
the
stone
that
concealed
the
stairway
the
gendarmes
who
followed
roland
began
to
think
him
as
brave
as
he
was
active
they
followed
the
subterranean
passage
to
the
first
gate
it
was
closed
but
not
locked
they
entered
the
funereal
vault
here
was
more
than
solitude
more
than
silence
here
was
death
the
bravest
felt
a
shiver
in
the
roots
of
their
hair
roland
went
from
tomb
to
tomb
sounding
each
with
the
butt
of
the
pistol
he
held
in
his
hand
silence
everywhere
they
crossed
the
vault
reached
the
second
gate
and
entered
the
chapel
the
same
silence
the
same
solitude
all
was
deserted
as
it
seemed
for
years
roland
went
straight
to
the
choir
there
lay
the
blood
on
the
stones
no
one
had
taken
the
trouble
to
efface
it
here
was
the
end
of
his
search
which
had
proved
futile
roland
could
not
bring
himself
to
retreat
he
fancied
he
was
not
attacked
because
of
his
numerous
escort
he
therefore
left
ten
men
and
a
torch
in
the
chapel
told
them
to
put
themselves
in
communication
through
the
ruined
window
with
the
captain
of
the
gendarmerie
who
was
ambushed
in
the
forest
within
a
few
feet
of
the
window
while
he
himself
with
two
men
retraced
his
steps
this
time
the
two
men
who
followed
roland
thought
him
more
than
brave
they
considered
him
foolhardy
but
roland
caring
little
whether
they
followed
or
not
retraced
his
own
steps
in
default
of
those
of
the
bandits
the
two
men
ashamed
followed
him
undoubtedly
the
chartreuse
was
deserted
when
roland
reached
the
great
portal
he
called
to
the
colonel
of
dragoons
he
and
his
men
were
at
their
post
roland
opened
the
door
and
joined
them
they
had
seen
nothing
heard
nothing
the
whole
party
entered
the
monastery
closing
and
barricading
the
door
behind
them
to
cut
off
the
bandits
retreat
if
they
were
fortunate
enough
to
meet
any
then
they
hastened
to
rejoin
their
comrades
who
on
their
side
had
united
with
the
captain
and
his
eight
men
and
were
waiting
for
them
in
the
choir
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
retire
two
o
clock
had
just
struck
nearly
three
hours
had
been
spent
in
fruitless
search
roland
rehabilitated
in
the
estimation
of
the
gendarmes
and
the
dragoons
who
saw
that
the
did
not
shirk
danger
regretfully
gave
the
signal
for
retreat
by
opening
the
door
of
the
chapel
which
looked
toward
the
forest
this
time
roland
merely
closed
the
door
behind
him
there
being
no
longer
any
hope
of
encountering
the
brigands
then
the
little
troop
returned
to
bourg
at
a
quick
step
the
captain
of
gendarmerie
with
his
eighteen
men
and
roland
the
barracks
while
the
colonel
and
his
twelve
men
continued
on
their
way
toward
the
town
it
was
the
sentinel
s
call
as
he
challenged
the
captain
and
his
party
which
had
attracted
the
attention
of
morgan
and
valensolle
and
it
was
the
noise
of
their
return
to
the
barracks
which
interrupted
the
supper
and
caused
morgan
to
cry
out
at
this
unforeseen
circumstance
attention
in
fact
in
the
present
situation
of
these
young
men
every
circumstance
merited
attention
so
the
meal
was
interrupted
their
jaws
ceased
to
work
to
give
the
eyes
and
ears
full
scope
it
soon
became
evident
that
the
services
of
their
eyes
were
alone
needed
each
gendarme
regained
his
room
without
light
the
numerous
barrack
windows
remained
dark
so
that
the
watchers
were
able
to
concentrate
their
attention
on
a
single
point
among
those
dark
windows
two
were
lighted
they
stood
relatively
back
from
the
rest
of
the
building
and
directly
opposite
to
the
one
where
the
young
men
were
supping
these
windows
were
on
the
first
floor
but
in
the
position
the
watchers
occupied
at
the
top
of
bales
of
hay
morgan
and
valensolle
were
not
only
on
a
level
but
could
even
look
down
into
them
these
windows
were
those
of
the
room
of
the
captain
of
gendarmes
whether
from
indifference
on
the
worthy
captain
s
part
or
by
reason
of
state
penury
the
windows
were
bare
of
curtains
so
that
thanks
to
the
two
candles
which
the
captain
had
lighted
in
his
guest
s
honor
morgan
and
valensolle
could
see
everything
that
took
place
in
this
room
suddenly
morgan
grasped
valensolle
s
arm
and
pressed
it
with
all
his
might
hey
said
valensolle
what
now
roland
had
just
thrown
his
hat
on
a
chair
and
morgan
had
recognized
him
roland
de
montrevel
he
exclaimed
roland
in
a
sergeant
s
uniform
this
time
we
are
on
his
track
while
he
is
still
seeking
ours
it
behooves
us
not
to
lose
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
valensolle
observing
that
his
friend
was
preparing
to
leave
him
inform
our
companions
you
stay
here
and
do
not
lose
sight
of
him
he
has
taken
off
his
sword
and
laid
his
pistols
aside
therefore
it
is
probable
he
intends
to
spend
the
night
in
the
captain
s
room
i
defy
him
to
take
any
road
no
matter
which
without
one
of
us
at
his
and
morgan
sliding
down
the
declivity
of
the
hay
disappeared
from
sight
leaving
his
companion
crouched
like
a
sphinx
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
roland
de
montrevel
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
morgan
returned
by
this
time
the
officer
s
windows
were
dark
like
all
the
others
of
the
barracks
well
asked
morgan
well
replied
valensolle
it
ended
most
prosaically
they
undressed
themselves
blew
out
the
candles
and
lay
down
the
captain
on
his
bed
roland
on
a
mattress
they
are
probably
trying
to
outsnore
each
other
at
the
present
in
that
case
said
morgan
to
them
and
to
us
ten
minutes
later
the
wish
was
granted
and
the
two
young
men
were
sleeping
as
if
they
did
not
have
danger
for
a
chapter
xli
the
hôtel
de
la
poste
that
same
morning
about
six
o
clock
at
the
cold
gray
breaking
of
a
february
day
a
rider
spurring
a
and
preceded
by
a
postilion
who
was
to
lead
back
the
horse
left
bourg
by
the
road
to
mâcon
or
we
say
mâcon
because
about
three
miles
from
the
capital
of
bresse
the
road
forks
the
one
to
the
right
keeping
straight
on
to
the
other
which
deviates
to
the
left
leading
to
mâcon
when
the
rider
reached
this
bifurcation
he
was
about
to
take
the
road
leading
to
mâcon
when
a
voice
apparently
coming
from
beneath
an
upset
cart
implored
his
pity
the
rider
called
to
the
postilion
to
see
what
the
matter
was
a
poor
was
pinned
down
under
a
load
of
vegetables
he
had
evidently
attempted
to
hold
up
the
cart
just
as
the
wheel
sinking
into
the
ditch
overbalanced
the
vehicle
the
cart
had
fallen
on
him
but
fortunately
he
said
he
thought
no
limbs
were
broken
and
all
he
wanted
was
to
get
the
cart
righted
and
then
he
could
recover
his
legs
the
rider
was
compassionate
to
his
fellow
being
for
he
not
only
allowed
the
postilion
to
stop
and
help
the
but
he
himself
dismounted
and
with
a
vigor
one
would
hardly
have
expected
from
so
slight
a
man
he
assisted
the
postilion
not
only
to
right
the
cart
but
to
replace
it
on
the
roadbed
after
which
he
offered
to
help
the
man
to
rise
but
the
latter
had
said
truly
he
really
was
safe
and
sound
and
if
there
were
a
slight
shaking
of
the
legs
it
only
served
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
proverb
that
god
takes
care
of
drunkards
the
man
was
profuse
in
his
thanks
and
took
his
horse
by
the
bridle
as
much
it
was
evident
to
hold
himself
steady
as
to
lead
the
animal
the
riders
remounted
their
homes
put
them
to
a
gallop
and
soon
disappeared
round
a
bend
which
the
road
makes
a
short
distance
before
it
reaches
the
woods
of
monnet
they
had
scarcely
disappeared
when
a
notable
change
took
place
in
the
demeanor
of
our
he
stopped
his
horse
straightened
up
put
the
mouthpiece
of
a
tiny
trumpet
to
his
lips
and
blew
three
times
a
species
of
groom
emerged
from
the
woods
which
line
the
road
leading
a
gentleman
s
horse
by
the
bridle
the
rapidly
removed
his
blouse
discarded
his
linen
trousers
and
appeared
in
vest
and
breeches
of
buckskin
and
top
boots
he
searched
in
his
cart
drew
forth
a
package
which
he
opened
shook
out
a
green
hunting
coat
with
gold
braidings
put
it
on
and
over
it
a
overcoat
took
from
the
servant
s
hands
a
hat
which
the
latter
presented
him
and
which
harmonized
with
his
elegant
costume
made
the
man
screw
his
spurs
to
his
boots
and
sprang
upon
his
horse
with
the
lightness
and
skill
of
an
experienced
horseman
at
seven
he
said
to
the
groom
be
on
the
road
between
and
ceyzeriat
you
will
meet
morgan
tell
him
that
he
he
knows
has
gone
to
mâcon
but
that
i
shall
be
there
before
then
without
troubling
himself
about
his
cart
and
vegetables
which
he
left
in
his
servant
s
charge
the
who
was
none
other
than
our
old
acquaintance
montbar
turned
his
horse
s
head
toward
the
monnet
woods
and
set
out
at
a
gallop
his
mount
was
not
a
miserable
post
hack
like
that
on
which
roland
was
riding
on
the
contrary
it
was
a
blooded
horse
so
that
montbar
easily
overtook
the
two
riders
and
passed
them
on
the
road
between
the
woods
of
monnet
and
polliat
the
horse
except
for
a
short
stop
at
did
the
or
thirty
miles
between
bourg
and
mâcon
without
resting
in
three
hours
arrived
at
mâcon
montbar
dismounted
at
the
hôtel
de
la
poste
the
only
one
which
at
that
time
was
fitted
to
receive
guests
of
distinction
for
the
rest
from
the
manner
in
which
montbar
was
received
it
was
evident
that
the
host
was
dealing
with
an
old
acquaintance
ah
is
it
you
monsieur
de
jayat
said
the
host
we
were
wondering
yesterday
what
had
become
of
you
it
s
more
than
a
month
since
we
ve
seen
you
in
these
do
you
think
it
s
as
long
as
that
friend
said
the
young
man
affecting
to
drop
his
r
s
after
the
fashion
of
the
day
yes
on
my
honor
that
s
so
i
ve
been
with
friends
the
trefforts
and
the
hautecourts
you
know
those
gentlemen
by
name
don
t
you
by
name
and
in
we
hunted
to
hounds
they
re
finely
equipped
word
of
honor
can
i
breakfast
here
this
morning
why
not
then
serve
me
a
chicken
a
bottle
of
bordeaux
two
cutlets
fruit
any
trifle
will
at
once
shall
it
be
served
in
your
room
or
in
the
common
room
in
the
common
room
it
s
more
amusing
only
give
me
a
table
to
myself
don
t
forget
my
horse
he
is
a
fine
beast
and
i
love
him
better
than
i
do
certain
christians
word
of
honor
the
landlord
gave
his
orders
montbar
stood
before
the
fire
his
drawn
aside
warming
his
calves
so
you
still
keep
to
the
posting
business
he
said
to
the
landlord
as
if
desirous
of
keeping
up
the
conversation
i
should
think
so
then
you
relay
the
diligences
not
the
diligences
but
the
ah
tell
me
i
want
to
go
to
chambéry
some
of
these
days
how
many
places
are
there
in
the
three
two
inside
and
one
out
with
the
do
i
stand
any
chance
of
finding
a
vacant
seat
it
may
happen
but
the
safest
way
is
to
hire
your
own
can
t
i
engage
a
place
beforehand
no
for
don
t
you
see
monsieur
de
jayat
that
if
travellers
take
places
from
paris
to
lyons
they
have
the
first
see
the
aristocrats
said
montbar
laughing
apropos
of
aristocrats
there
is
one
behind
me
posting
here
i
passed
him
about
a
mile
the
other
side
of
polliat
i
thought
his
hack
a
little
oh
exclaimed
the
landlord
that
s
not
astonishing
my
brothers
in
the
business
have
a
poor
lot
of
why
there
s
our
man
continued
montbar
i
thought
i
had
more
of
a
lead
of
roland
was
in
fact
just
passing
the
windows
at
a
gallop
do
you
still
want
chamber
no
monsieur
de
jayat
asked
the
landlord
why
do
you
ask
because
it
is
the
best
one
and
if
you
don
t
take
it
i
shall
give
it
to
that
man
provided
he
wants
to
make
any
oh
don
t
bother
about
me
i
shan
t
know
till
later
in
the
day
whether
i
go
or
stay
if
the
means
to
remain
give
him
no
i
will
content
myself
with
no
the
gentleman
is
served
said
the
waiter
looking
through
the
door
which
led
from
the
kitchen
to
the
common
room
montbar
nodded
and
accepted
the
invitation
he
entered
the
common
room
just
as
roland
came
into
the
kitchen
the
dinner
was
on
the
table
montbar
changed
his
plate
and
sat
down
with
his
back
to
the
door
the
precaution
was
useless
roland
did
not
enter
the
common
room
and
montbar
breakfasted
without
interruption
when
dessert
was
over
however
the
host
himself
brought
in
his
coffee
montbar
understood
that
the
good
man
was
in
talkative
humor
a
fortunate
circumstance
for
there
were
certain
things
he
was
anxious
to
hear
about
well
said
montbar
what
became
of
our
man
did
he
only
change
horses
no
no
no
said
the
landlord
as
you
said
he
s
an
aristocrat
he
ordered
breakfast
in
his
own
his
room
or
my
room
asked
montbar
for
i
m
certain
you
put
him
in
that
famous
no
confound
it
monsieur
de
jayat
it
s
your
own
fault
you
told
me
i
could
do
as
i
and
you
took
me
at
my
word
that
was
right
i
shall
be
satisfied
with
no
you
ll
be
very
uncomfortable
it
s
only
separated
from
no
by
a
partition
and
you
can
hear
everything
that
happens
from
one
room
to
the
nonsense
my
dear
man
do
you
think
i
ve
come
here
to
do
improper
things
or
sing
seditious
songs
that
you
are
afraid
the
stranger
should
hear
or
see
what
i
do
oh
that
s
not
what
is
it
then
i
m
not
afraid
you
ll
disturb
others
i
m
afraid
they
ll
disturb
so
your
new
guest
is
a
roisterer
no
he
looks
to
me
like
an
what
makes
you
think
so
his
manner
in
the
first
place
then
he
inquired
what
regiment
was
in
garrison
at
mâcon
and
when
i
told
him
it
was
the
mounted
chasseurs
he
said
good
the
colonel
is
a
friend
of
mine
can
a
waiter
take
him
my
card
and
ask
him
to
breakfast
with
me
ah
ha
so
you
see
how
it
is
when
officers
get
together
they
make
so
much
racket
and
noise
perhaps
they
ll
not
only
breakfast
but
dine
and
sup
i
ve
told
you
already
my
good
man
that
i
am
not
sure
of
passing
the
night
here
i
am
expecting
letters
from
paris
which
will
decide
me
in
the
meantime
light
a
fire
in
no
and
make
as
little
noise
as
possible
to
avoid
annoying
my
neighbors
and
at
the
same
time
send
me
up
pen
and
ink
and
some
paper
i
have
letters
to
montbar
s
orders
were
promptly
executed
and
he
himself
followed
the
waiter
to
see
that
roland
was
not
disturbed
by
his
proximity
the
chamber
was
just
what
the
landlord
had
said
not
a
movement
could
be
made
not
a
word
uttered
in
the
next
room
that
was
not
heard
consequently
montbar
distinctly
heard
the
waiter
announce
colonel
then
the
resounding
steps
of
the
latter
in
the
corridor
and
the
exclamations
of
the
two
friends
delighted
to
meet
again
on
the
other
hand
roland
who
had
been
for
a
moment
disturbed
by
the
noise
in
the
adjoining
room
forgot
it
as
soon
as
it
had
ceased
and
there
was
no
danger
of
its
being
renewed
montbar
left
alone
seated
himself
at
the
table
on
which
were
paper
pen
and
ink
and
remained
perfectly
motionless
the
two
officers
had
known
each
other
in
italy
where
roland
was
under
the
command
of
the
latter
being
then
a
captain
and
roland
a
lieutenant
at
present
their
rank
was
equal
but
roland
had
beside
a
double
commission
from
the
first
consul
and
the
minister
of
police
which
placed
all
officers
of
his
own
rank
under
his
command
and
even
within
the
limits
of
his
mission
those
of
a
higher
rank
morgan
had
not
been
mistaken
in
supposing
that
amélie
s
brother
was
in
pursuit
of
the
companions
of
jehu
if
roland
s
nocturnal
search
at
the
chartreuse
of
seillon
was
not
convincing
the
conversation
between
the
young
officer
and
his
colleague
was
proof
positive
in
it
it
developed
that
the
first
consul
was
really
sending
fifty
thousand
francs
as
a
gift
to
the
monks
of
by
post
but
that
this
money
was
in
reality
a
trap
devised
for
the
capture
of
the
companions
of
jehu
if
all
means
failed
to
surprise
them
in
the
chartreuse
of
seillon
or
some
other
refuge
it
to
be
seen
how
these
bandits
should
be
captured
the
case
was
eagerly
debated
between
the
two
officers
while
they
had
breakfast
by
the
time
dessert
was
served
they
were
both
agreed
upon
a
plan
that
same
evening
morgan
received
the
following
letter
just
as
adler
told
us
next
friday
at
five
o
clock
the
will
leave
paris
with
fifty
thousand
francs
for
the
fathers
of
the
three
places
the
one
in
the
coupé
and
the
two
in
the
interior
are
already
engaged
by
three
travellers
who
will
join
the
coach
one
at
sens
the
other
two
at
tonnerre
the
travellers
are
in
the
coupé
one
of
citizen
fouché
s
best
men
in
the
interior
roland
de
montrevel
and
the
colonel
of
the
chasseurs
garrisoned
at
mâcon
they
will
be
in
civilians
clothes
not
to
excite
suspicion
but
armed
to
the
teeth
twelve
mounted
chasseurs
with
muskets
pistols
and
sabres
will
escort
the
coach
but
at
some
distance
behind
it
so
as
to
arrive
during
the
fray
the
first
pistol
fired
will
be
the
signal
for
putting
their
horses
to
a
gallop
and
falling
upon
us
now
my
advice
is
that
in
spite
of
these
precautions
in
fact
because
of
these
precautions
the
attack
should
be
made
at
the
place
agreed
upon
namely
the
if
that
is
also
the
opinion
of
the
comrades
let
me
know
it
i
will
myself
take
the
coach
as
postilion
from
mâcon
to
belleville
i
will
undertake
to
settle
the
colonel
and
one
of
you
must
be
responsible
for
fouché
s
agent
as
for
roland
de
montrevel
no
harm
will
befall
him
for
i
have
a
means
known
to
me
alone
and
by
me
invented
by
which
he
can
be
prevented
from
leaving
the
coach
the
precise
day
and
hour
at
which
the
mail
to
chambéry
will
pass
the
is
saturday
at
six
in
the
evening
answer
in
these
words
saturday
six
of
the
evening
and
all
will
go
on
rollers
montbar
at
midnight
montbar
who
had
complained
of
the
noise
his
neighbor
made
and
had
removed
to
a
room
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
inn
was
awakened
by
a
courier
who
was
none
other
than
the
groom
who
had
brought
him
his
horse
ready
bridled
and
saddled
in
the
morning
the
letter
contained
only
these
words
followed
by
a
postscript
saturday
six
of
the
evening
morgan
do
not
forget
even
when
fighting
above
all
when
fighting
that
roland
de
montrevel
s
life
is
safeguarded
the
young
man
read
this
reply
with
visible
satisfaction
the
matter
was
no
longer
a
mere
stoppage
of
a
diligence
but
a
species
of
affair
of
honor
among
men
of
differing
opinions
with
clashes
of
courage
and
bravery
it
was
no
longer
a
matter
of
gold
spilled
upon
the
highroad
but
of
blood
to
be
shed
not
of
pistols
loaded
with
powder
and
wielded
by
a
child
s
hands
but
of
deadly
weapons
handled
by
soldiers
accustomed
to
their
use
for
the
rest
as
montbar
had
all
the
day
that
was
dawning
and
the
morrow
before
him
in
which
to
mature
his
plans
he
contented
himself
with
asking
his
groom
to
inquire
which
postilion
would
take
the
coach
at
mâcon
at
five
o
clock
for
the
two
stages
between
mâcon
and
belleville
he
also
sent
him
to
buy
four
and
two
padlocks
fastening
with
keys
he
already
knew
that
the
mail
was
due
at
mâcon
at
half
past
four
waited
for
the
travellers
to
dine
and
started
again
punctually
at
five
no
doubt
all
his
plans
were
previously
laid
for
after
giving
these
directions
montbar
dismissed
his
servant
and
went
to
sleep
like
a
man
who
has
long
arrears
of
slumber
to
make
up
the
next
morning
he
did
not
wake
or
rather
did
not
come
downstairs
until
nine
o
clock
he
asked
casually
what
had
become
of
his
noisy
neighbor
and
was
told
that
he
had
started
in
the
lyons
mail
at
six
in
the
morning
with
his
friend
the
colonel
of
the
chasseurs
but
the
landlord
thought
they
had
only
engaged
places
as
far
as
tonnerre
if
monsieur
de
jayat
had
interested
himself
in
the
young
officer
the
latter
in
turn
had
made
inquiries
about
him
asking
who
he
was
whether
he
came
habitually
to
the
hotel
and
whether
he
would
be
willing
to
sell
his
horse
the
landlord
had
replied
that
he
knew
monsieur
de
jayat
well
for
he
was
in
the
habit
of
coming
to
the
hotel
whenever
business
brought
him
to
mâcon
and
that
as
for
the
horse
he
did
not
believe
considering
the
affection
the
young
gentleman
showed
for
the
animal
that
he
would
consent
to
part
with
him
for
any
price
on
which
the
traveller
had
departed
without
saying
any
more
after
breakfast
de
jayat
who
seemed
to
find
time
hanging
heavily
on
his
hands
ordered
his
horse
mounted
it
and
rode
out
from
mâcon
by
the
lyons
road
as
long
as
he
was
in
the
town
he
allowed
his
horse
to
take
the
pace
his
fancy
dictated
but
once
beyond
it
he
gathered
up
the
reins
and
pressed
the
animal
with
his
knees
the
hint
sufficed
and
the
animal
broke
into
a
gallop
montbar
passed
through
the
villages
of
varennes
la
crèche
and
and
did
not
stop
until
he
reached
the
the
spot
was
exactly
as
valensolle
had
described
it
and
was
admirably
adapted
for
an
ambuscade
the
stood
in
a
tiny
valley
between
a
sharp
declivity
and
a
rise
in
the
ground
a
little
rivulet
without
a
name
flowed
past
the
corner
of
the
garden
and
made
its
way
to
the
saône
just
above
challe
tall
bushy
trees
followed
the
course
of
the
little
stream
and
described
a
inclosing
the
house
on
three
sides
the
house
itself
was
formerly
an
inn
which
proved
unproductive
to
the
innkeeper
it
had
been
closed
for
seven
or
eight
years
and
was
beginning
to
fall
into
decay
before
reaching
it
the
main
road
coming
from
mâcon
made
a
sharp
turn
montbar
examined
the
locality
with
the
care
of
an
engineer
choosing
his
ground
for
a
battlefield
he
drew
a
pencil
and
a
from
his
pocket
and
made
an
accurate
plan
of
the
position
then
he
returned
to
mâcon
two
hours
later
his
groom
departed
carrying
the
plan
to
morgan
having
informed
his
master
that
antoine
was
the
name
of
the
postilion
who
was
to
take
the
coach
from
mâcon
to
belleville
the
groom
also
gave
him
the
four
and
the
two
padlocks
he
had
purchased
montbar
ordered
up
a
bottle
of
old
burgundy
and
sent
for
antoine
ten
minutes
later
antoine
appeared
he
was
a
fine
handsome
fellow
or
six
years
of
age
about
montbar
s
height
a
fact
which
the
latter
in
looking
him
over
from
head
to
foot
remarked
with
satisfaction
the
postilion
paused
at
the
threshold
and
carrying
his
hand
to
his
hat
in
a
military
salute
he
said
did
the
citizen
send
for
me
are
you
the
man
they
call
antoine
asked
montbar
at
your
service
and
that
of
your
well
you
can
serve
me
friend
but
close
the
door
and
come
antoine
closed
the
door
came
within
two
steps
of
montbar
saluted
again
and
said
ready
in
the
first
place
said
montbar
if
you
have
no
objections
we
ll
drink
a
glass
of
wine
to
the
health
of
your
oh
oh
my
mistress
cried
antoine
can
fellows
like
me
afford
mistresses
they
re
all
very
well
for
gentlemen
such
as
come
you
scamp
said
montbar
you
can
t
make
me
believe
that
with
your
you
ve
made
a
vow
of
oh
i
don
t
say
i
m
a
monk
in
that
particular
i
may
have
a
bit
of
a
here
and
there
along
the
yes
at
every
tavern
and
that
s
why
we
stop
so
often
with
our
return
horses
to
drink
a
drop
or
fill
a
confound
it
said
antoine
with
an
indescribable
twist
of
the
shoulders
a
fellow
must
have
his
well
taste
the
wine
my
lad
i
ll
warrant
it
won
t
make
you
and
filling
a
glass
montbar
signed
to
the
postilion
to
fill
the
other
a
fine
honor
for
me
to
your
health
and
that
of
your
company
this
was
an
habitual
phrase
of
the
worthy
postilion
a
sort
of
extension
of
politeness
which
did
not
need
the
presence
of
others
to
justify
it
in
his
eyes
ha
said
he
after
drinking
and
smacking
his
lips
there
s
vintage
for
you
and
i
have
gulped
it
down
at
a
swallow
as
if
it
were
that
was
a
mistake
yes
it
was
a
luckily
said
montbar
refilling
his
glass
you
can
repair
no
higher
than
my
thumb
citizen
said
the
facetious
postilion
taking
care
that
his
thumb
touched
the
rim
of
the
glass
one
minute
said
montbar
just
as
antoine
was
putting
his
glass
to
his
lips
just
in
time
said
the
postilion
it
was
on
its
way
what
is
it
you
wouldn
t
let
me
drink
to
the
health
of
your
mistress
but
i
hope
you
won
t
refuse
to
drink
to
oh
that
s
never
refused
especially
with
such
wine
to
the
health
of
your
mistress
and
her
thereupon
citizen
antoine
swallowed
the
crimson
liquor
tasting
and
relishing
it
this
time
hey
exclaimed
montbar
you
re
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
my
pooh
retorted
the
postilion
yes
suppose
i
have
several
mistresses
if
i
don
t
name
the
one
we
drink
to
what
good
will
it
do
her
why
that
s
true
sad
but
you
ll
have
to
try
again
my
ha
try
again
of
course
can
t
do
things
with
a
man
like
you
the
sin
s
committed
we
ll
drink
and
antoine
held
out
his
glass
montbar
filled
it
to
the
brim
now
said
antoine
eying
the
bottle
and
making
sure
it
was
empty
there
must
be
no
mistake
her
name
to
the
beautiful
josephine
said
montbar
to
the
beautiful
josephine
repeated
antoine
and
he
swallowed
the
burgundy
with
increasing
satisfaction
then
after
drinking
and
wiping
his
lips
on
his
sleeve
he
said
as
he
set
the
glass
on
the
table
hey
one
moment
what
now
exclaimed
montbar
anything
wrong
this
time
i
should
say
so
we
ve
made
a
great
blunder
but
it
s
too
late
why
so
the
bottle
is
that
one
yes
but
not
this
so
saying
montbar
took
from
the
chimney
corner
another
bottle
already
uncorked
ah
ah
exclaimed
antoine
a
radiant
smile
lighting
his
face
is
there
any
remedy
for
it
asked
montbar
there
is
replied
antoine
holding
out
his
glass
montbar
filled
it
as
scrupulously
full
as
he
had
the
first
three
well
said
the
postilion
holding
the
ruby
liquid
to
the
light
and
admiring
its
sparkle
as
i
was
saying
we
drank
to
the
health
of
the
beautiful
josephine
yes
said
montbar
but
said
antoine
there
are
a
devilish
lot
of
josephines
in
true
how
many
do
you
suppose
there
are
antoine
perhaps
a
hundred
granted
what
then
well
out
of
that
hundred
thousand
a
tenth
of
them
must
be
that
s
a
good
say

all
that
makes

the
devil

in
arithmetic
i
m
the

of
those
five
thousand

family

to
the
beautiful
josephine
stop
this
glass
was
begun
it
won
t
do
if
the
health
is
to
do
her
any
good
we
ll
have
to
empty
it
and
fill
it
he
put
the
glass
to
his
lips
there
it
s
empty
he
said
and
full
added
montbar
putting
the
bottle
to
the
glass
i
m
ready
to
the
beautiful
josephine
to
the
beautiful
josephine
lollier
and
montbar
emptied
his
glass
by
the
lord
exclaimed
antoine
wait
a
moment
josephine
lollier
why
i
know
i
didn
t
say

josephine
lollier
why

daughter
of
the

exclaimed
the
postilion
you
re
not
to
be
pitied
a
pretty
slip
of
a
girl
to
the
health
of
beautiful
josephine
and
he
swallowed
his
fifth
glass
of
burgundy
now
asked
montbar
do
you
understand
why
i
had
you
sent
up
here
my
lad
no

i
don
t

deaf
folk
asked
the
postilion
banteringly
no
but
i
ve
lived
a
good
deal
among
drunkards
replied
montbar
filling
antoine
s
glass
again
a
man
is
not
a
drunkard
because
he
likes
wine
said
antoine
i
agree
with
you
my
good
fellow
replied
montbar
a
man
is
only
a
drunkard
when
he
can
t
carry
his
well
said
cried
antoine
who
seemed
to
carry
his
pretty
well
i
m
you

suspected
that

had
an
object

our
priest
observed
antoine

it
said
montbar
emptying
the
last
of
the
second
bottle
into
antoine
s
glass
you
know
the
proverb
said
the
postilion
what
is
it
never
defy
a
fool
to
commit
his
folly
to
the
health
of
the
companions
of
amen
responded
montbar
and
the
five
louis
asked
antoine
putting
his
glass
on
the
table
there
they
thank
you
you
shall
have
the
holsters
on
your
saddle
but
take
my
advice
and
don
t
put
pistols
in
em
or
if
you
do
follow
père
jérôme
s
example
he
s
the
conductor
of
the
geneva
diligence
and
put
powder
and
no
balls
in
and
with
that
philanthropic
advice
the
postilion
took
his
leave
and
went
down
the
stairway
singing
a
postilion
s
song
in
a
vinous
voice
montbar
followed
the
song
conscientiously
through
two
verses
then
as
the
voice
died
away
in
the
distance
he
was
obliged
to
forego
the
rest
of
the
song
however
interesting
he
may
have
found
it
chapter
xlii
the
chambéry
the
next
day
at
five
in
the
afternoon
antoine
anxious
no
doubt
not
to
be
late
was
in
the
courtyard
of
the
hôtel
de
la
poste
harnessing
the
three
horses
which
were
to
relay
the
shortly
after
the
coach
rumbled
into
the
courtyard
at
a
gallop
and
was
pulled
up
under
the
windows
of
a
room
close
to
the
servants
stairway
which
had
seemed
greatly
to
occupy
antoine
s
attention
if
any
one
had
paid
attention
to
so
slight
a
detail
it
might
have
been
observed
that
the
was
somewhat
imprudently
drawn
aside
to
permit
the
occupant
of
the
room
to
see
the
persons
who
got
out
of
the
coach
there
were
three
men
who
with
the
haste
of
famished
travellers
made
their
way
toward
the
brilliantly
lighted
windows
of
the
common
room
they
had
scarcely
entered
when
a
smart
postilion
came
down
the
kitchen
staircase
shod
simply
with
thin
pumps
over
which
he
intended
to
pull
his
heavy
these
he
received
from
antoine
slipping
five
louis
into
his
hand
at
the
same
time
and
turned
for
the
man
to
throw
his
riding
cape
over
his
shoulders
a
protection
rendered
necessary
by
the
severity
of
the
weather
this
completed
antoine
returned
hastily
to
the
stables
and
hid
in
the
darkest
corner
as
for
the
man
who
had
taken
his
place
reassured
no
doubt
by
the
high
collar
of
the
cape
that
concealed
half
of
his
face
he
went
straight
to
the
horses
which
stood
ready
harnessed
slipped
his
pistols
into
the
holsters
and
profitting
by
the
moment
when
the
other
horses
were
being
led
into
the
stable
by
their
postilion
he
took
a
gimlet
which
might
in
case
of
need
serve
as
a
dagger
from
his
pocket
and
screwed
the
four
rings
into
the
woodwork
of
the
coach
one
into
each
door
and
the
other
two
into
the
body
of
the
coach
after
which
he
put
the
horses
to
with
a
rapidity
and
skill
which
bespoke
in
him
a
man
familiar
from
childhood
with
all
the
details
of
an
art
pushed
to
extremes
in
our
day
by
that
honorable
class
of
society
which
we
call
gentlemen
that
done
he
waited
quieting
his
restless
horses
by
voice
and
whip
judiciously
combined
or
used
in
turn
everyone
knows
the
rapidity
with
which
the
meals
of
the
unhappy
beings
condemned
to
travel
by
mail
are
hurried
through
the
was
not
up
when
the
voice
of
the
conductor
was
heard
calling
come
citizen
travellers
take
your
montbar
placed
himself
close
to
the
carriage
door
and
recognized
roland
and
the
colonel
of
the
chasseurs
perfectly
in
spite
of
their
disguise
as
they
jumped
into
the
coach
paying
no
attention
whatever
to
the
postilion
the
latter
closed
the
door
upon
them
slipped
the
padlock
through
the
two
rings
and
turned
the
key
then
walking
around
the
coach
he
pretended
to
drop
his
whip
before
the
other
door
and
in
stooping
for
it
slipped
the
second
padlock
through
the
rings
deftly
turned
the
key
as
he
straightened
up
and
assured
that
the
two
officers
were
securely
locked
in
he
sprang
upon
his
horse
grumbling
at
the
conductor
who
had
left
him
to
do
his
work
in
fact
the
conductor
was
still
squabbling
with
the
landlord
over
his
bill
when
the
third
traveller
got
into
his
place
in
the
coupé
are
you
coming
this
evening
or
morning
père
françois
cried
the
pretended
postilion
imitating
antoine
as
best
he
could
all
right
all
right
i
m
coming
answered
the
conductor
then
looking
around
him
why
where
are
the
travellers
he
asked
here
replied
the
two
officers
from
the
interior
and
the
agent
from
the
coupé
is
the
door
properly
closed
persisted
père
françois
i
ll
answer
for
that
said
montbar
then
off
you
go
baggage
cried
the
conductor
as
he
climbed
into
the
coupé
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
the
postilion
did
not
wait
to
be
told
twice
he
started
his
horses
digging
his
spurs
into
the
belly
of
the
one
he
rode
and
lashing
the
others
vigorously
the
dashed
forward
at
a
gallop
montbar
drove
as
if
he
had
never
done
anything
else
in
his
life
as
he
crossed
the
town
the
windows
rattled
and
the
houses
shook
never
did
real
postilion
crack
his
whip
with
greater
science
as
he
left
mâcon
he
saw
a
little
troop
of
horse
they
were
the
twelve
chasseurs
told
off
to
follow
the
coach
without
seeming
to
escort
it
the
colonel
passed
his
head
through
the
window
and
made
a
sign
to
the
sergeant
who
commanded
them
montbar
did
not
seem
to
notice
anything
but
after
going
some
four
or
five
hundred
yards
he
turned
his
head
while
executing
a
symphony
with
his
whip
and
saw
that
the
escort
had
started
wait
my
babes
said
montbar
i
ll
make
you
see
the
and
he
dug
in
his
spurs
and
brought
down
his
whip
the
horses
seemed
to
have
wings
and
the
coach
flew
over
the
cobblestones
like
the
chariot
of
thunder
rumbling
past
the
conductor
became
alarmed
hey
master
antoine
cried
he
are
you
drunk
drunk
fine
drinking
replied
montbar
i
dined
on
a
beetroot
damn
him
if
he
goes
like
that
cried
roland
thrusting
his
head
through
the
window
the
escort
can
t
keep
you
hear
what
he
says
shrieked
the
conductor
no
replied
montbar
i
don
well
he
says
that
if
you
keep
this
up
the
escort
can
t
is
there
an
escort
asked
montbar
of
course
we
re
carrying
government
that
s
different
you
ought
to
have
said
so
at
but
instead
of
slacking
his
pace
the
coach
was
whirled
along
as
before
if
there
was
any
change
it
was
for
greater
velocity
than
before
antoine
if
there
s
an
accident
i
ll
shoot
you
through
the
head
shouted
the
conductor
run
along
exclaimed
montbar
everybody
knows
those
pistols
haven
t
any
balls
in
possibly
not
but
mine
have
cried
the
police
agent
that
remains
to
be
seen
replied
montbar
keeping
on
his
way
at
the
same
pace
without
heed
to
these
remonstrances
on
they
went
with
the
speed
of
lightning
through
the
village
of
varennes
then
through
that
of
la
crêche
and
the
little
town
of
only
half
a
mile
further
and
they
would
reach
the
the
horses
were
dripping
and
tossed
the
foam
from
their
mouths
as
they
neighed
with
excitement
montbar
glanced
behind
him
more
than
a
mile
back
the
sparks
were
flying
from
the
escort
s
horses
before
him
was
the
mountainous
declivity
down
it
he
dashed
gathering
the
reins
to
master
his
horses
when
the
time
came
the
conductor
had
ceased
expostulating
for
he
saw
that
the
hand
which
guided
the
horses
was
firm
and
capable
but
from
time
to
time
the
colonel
thrust
his
head
through
the
window
to
look
for
his
men
down
the
slope
montbar
had
his
horses
under
control
without
however
seeming
to
check
their
course
then
he
began
to
sing
at
the
top
of
his
voice
the
réveil
du
peuple
the
song
of
the
royalists
just
as
the
marseillaise
was
the
song
of
the
jacobins
what
s
that
rogue
about
cried
roland
putting
his
head
through
the
window
tell
him
to
hold
his
tongue
conductor
or
i
ll
put
a
ball
through
his
perhaps
the
conductor
might
have
repeated
roland
s
threat
to
montbar
but
he
suddenly
saw
a
black
line
blocking
the
road
halt
conductor
thundered
a
voice
the
next
moment
postilion
drive
over
the
bellies
of
those
bandits
shouted
the
police
agent
drive
on
yourself
said
montbar
do
you
suppose
i
m
going
over
the
stomachs
of
friends
the
mail
coach
stopped
as
if
by
magic
go
on
go
on
cried
roland
and
the
colonel
aware
that
the
escort
was
too
far
behind
to
help
them
ha
you
villain
of
a
postilion
cried
the
police
agent
springing
out
of
the
coupé
and
pointing
his
pistol
at
montbar
you
shall
pay
for
the
words
were
scarcely
uttered
when
montbar
forestalling
him
fired
and
the
agent
rolled
mortally
wounded
under
the
wheels
of
the
coach
his
fingers
convulsed
by
death
touched
the
trigger
and
the
pistol
went
off
but
the
ball
touched
no
one
conductor
shouted
the
two
officers
by
all
the
powers
of
heaven
open
open
open
quickly
gentlemen
said
morgan
advancing
we
are
not
attacking
your
persons
we
merely
want
the
government
money
conductor
that
fifty
thousand
francs
and
quickly
too
two
shots
from
the
interior
made
answer
for
the
officers
who
after
vainly
shaking
the
doors
were
still
more
fruitlessly
attempting
to
force
themselves
through
the
windows
no
doubt
one
of
their
shots
took
effect
for
a
cry
of
rage
was
heard
and
a
flash
illuminated
the
road
the
colonel
gave
a
sigh
and
fell
back
against
roland
he
was
killed
outright
roland
fired
again
but
no
one
replied
to
him
his
pistols
were
both
discharged
locked
in
as
he
was
he
could
not
use
his
sabre
and
he
howled
with
rage
meantime
the
conductor
was
forced
with
a
pistol
at
his
throat
to
give
up
the
money
two
men
took
the
bags
containing
the
fifty
thousand
francs
and
fastened
them
on
montbar
s
horse
which
his
groom
had
brought
ready
saddled
and
bridled
as
if
to
a
meet
montbar
kicked
off
his
heavy
boots
and
sprang
into
the
saddle
my
compliments
to
the
first
consul
monsieur
de
montrevel
cried
morgan
then
turning
to
his
companions
he
cried
scatter
which
way
you
will
you
know
the
rendezvous
for
yes
yes
replied
ten
or
a
dozen
voices
and
the
band
dispersed
like
a
flock
of
birds
disappearing
down
the
valley
into
the
shadow
of
the
trees
that
lined
the
banks
of
the
little
river
and
surrounded
the
at
that
moment
the
gallop
of
horses
was
heard
and
the
escort
alarmed
by
the
pistol
shots
appeared
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
came
down
the
slope
like
an
avalanche
but
it
came
too
late
it
found
only
the
conductor
sitting
dazed
by
the
roadside
the
bodies
of
the
colonel
and
of
fouché
s
agent
and
roland
a
prisoner
roaring
like
a
lion
gnawing
at
the
bars
of

cage

lord
grenville
s
reply
while
the
events
we
have
just
recorded
were
transpiring
and
occupying
the
minds
and
newspapers
of
the
provinces
other
events
of
very
different
import
were
maturing
in
paris
which
were
destined
to
occupy
the
minds
and
newspapers
of
the
whole
world
lord
tanlay
had
returned
bringing
the
reply
of
his
uncle
lord
grenville
this
reply
consisted
of
a
letter
addressed
to
de
talleyrand
inclosing
a
memorandum
for
the
first
consul
the
letter
was
couched
in
the
following
terms
downing
street
february
sir
i
have
received
and
placed
before
the
king
the
letter
which
you
transmitted
to
me
through
my
nephew
lord
tanlay
his
majesty
seeing
no
reason
to
depart
from
the
customs
of
europe
in
treating
with
foreign
states
directs
me
to
forward
you
in
his
name
the
official
reply
which
is
herewith
inclosed
i
have
the
honor
to
be
with
the
highest
esteem
your
very
humble
and
obedient
servant
grenville
the
letter
was
dry
the
memorandum
curt
moreover
the
first
consul
s
letter
to
king
george
was
autographic
and
king
george
not
departing
from
the
customs
of
europe
in
treating
with
foreign
states
replied
by
a
simple
memorandum
written
by
a
secretary
true
the
memorandum
was
signed
it
was
a
long
recrimination
against
france
against
the
spirit
of
disorder
which
disturbed
the
nation
against
the
fears
which
that
spirit
of
disorder
inspired
in
all
europe
and
on
the
necessity
imposed
on
the
sovereigns
of
europe
for
the
sake
of
their
own
safety
to
repress
it
in
short
the
memorandum
was
virtually
a
continuation
of
the
war
the
reading
of
such
a
dictum
made
bonaparte
s
eyes
flash
with
the
flame
which
in
him
preceded
his
great
decisions
as
lightning
precedes
thunder
so
sir
said
he
turning
to
lord
tanlay
this
is
all
you
have
obtained
yes
citizen
first
then
you
did
not
repeat
verbally
to
your
uncle
all
that
i
charged
you
to
say
to
him
i
did
not
omit
a
did
you
tell
him
that
you
had
lived
in
france
three
years
that
you
had
seen
her
had
studied
her
that
she
was
strong
powerful
prosperous
and
desirous
of
peace
while
prepared
for
war
i
told
him
all
did
you
add
that
the
war
which
england
is
making
against
france
is
a
senseless
war
that
the
spirit
of
disorder
of
which
they
speak
and
which
at
the
worst
is
only
the
effervescence
of
freedom
too
long
restrained
which
it
were
wiser
to
confine
to
france
by
means
of
a
general
peace
that
that
peace
is
the
sole
which
can
prevent
it
from
crossing
our
frontiers
and
that
if
the
volcano
of
war
is
lighted
in
france
france
will
spread
like
lava
over
foreign
lands
italy
is
delivered
says
the
king
of
england
but
from
whom
from
her
liberators
italy
is
delivered
but
why
because
i
conquered
egypt
from
the
delta
to
the
third
cataract
italy
is
delivered
because
i
was
no
longer
in
italy
but
i
am
here
in
a
month
i
can
be
in
italy
what
do
i
need
to
win
her
back
from
the
alps
to
the
adriatic
a
single
battle
do
you
know
what
masséna
is
doing
in
defending
genoa
waiting
for
me
ha
the
sovereigns
of
europe
need
war
to
protect
their
crowns
well
my
lord
i
tell
you
that
i
will
shake
europe
until
their
crowns
tremble
on
their
heads
want
war
do
they
just
wait

the
door
between
the

and
the

s
office
opened
precipitately
and
bourrienne
rushed
in
his
face
terrified
as
though
he
thought
bonaparte
were
calling
for

when
he

highly
excited
crumpling

with

other
on
his
desk
while
lord
tanlay
was
standing
calm
erect
and
silent
near
him
he
understood
immediately
that
england
s
answer
had
irritated
the
first
consul
did
you
call
me
general
he
asked
yes
said
the
first
consul
sit
down
there
and
then
in
a
harsh
jerky
voice
without
seeking
his
words
which
on
the
contrary
seemed
to
crowd
through
the
portal
of
his
brain
he
dictated
the
following
proclamation
soldiers
in
promising
peace
to
the
french
people
i
was
your
mouthpiece
i
know
your
power
you
are
the
same
men
who
conquered
the
rhine
holland
and
italy
and
granted
peace
beneath
the
walls
of
astounded
vienna
soldiers
it
is
no
longer
our
own
frontiers
that
you
have
to
defend
it
is
the
enemy
s
country
you
must
now
invade
soldiers
when
the
time
comes
i
shall
be
among
you
and
astounded
europe
shall
remember
that
you
belong
to
the
race
of
heroes
bourrienne
raised
his
head
expectant
after
writing
the
last
words
well
that
s
all
said
bonaparte
shall
i
add
the
sacramental
words
vive
la
république
why
do
you
ask
that
because
we
have
issued
no
proclamation
during
the
last
four
months
and
something
may
be
changed
in
the
ordinary
the
proclamation
will
do
as
it
is
said
bonaparte
add
nothing
to
taking
a
pen
he
dashed
rather
than
wrote
his
signature
at
the
bottom
of
the
paper
then
handing
it
to
bourrienne
he
said
see
that
it
appears
in
the
moniteur
bourrienne
left
the
room
carrying
the
proclamation
with
him
bonaparte
left
alone
with
lord
tanlay
walked
up
and
down
the
room
for
a
moment
as
though
he
had
forgotten
the
englishman
s
presence
then
he
stopped
suddenly
before
him
my
lord
he
asked
do
you
think
you
obtained
from
your
uncle
all
that
another
man
might
have
obtained
in
your
place
more
citizen
first
more
more
pray
what
have
you
obtained
i
think
that
the
citizen
first
consul
did
not
read
the
royal
memorandum
with
all
the
attention
it
heavens
exclaimed
bonaparte
i
know
it
by
then
the
citizen
first
consul
can
not
have
weighed
the
meaning
and
the
wording
of
a
certain
you
think
so
i
am
sure
of
it
and
if
the
citizen
first
consul
will
permit
me
to
read
him
the
paragraph
to
which
i
allude
bonaparte
relaxed
his
hold
upon
the
crumpled
note
and
handed
it
to
lord
tanlay
saying
read
sir
john
cast
his
eyes
over
the
document
with
which
he
seemed
to
be
familiar
paused
at
the
tenth
paragraph
and
read
the
best
and
surest
means
for
peace
and
security
and
for
their
continuance
would
be
the
restoration
of
that
line
of
princes
who
for
so
many
centuries
have
preserved
to
the
french
nation
its
internal
prosperity
and
the
respect
and
consideration
of
foreign
countries
such
an
event
would
have
removed
and
at
any
time
will
remove
the
obstacles
which
are
now
in
the
way
of
negotiations
and
peace
it
would
guarantee
to
france
the
tranquil
possession
of
her
former
territory
and
procure
for
all
the
other
nations
of
europe
through
a
like
tranquillity
and
peace
that
security
which
they
are
now
obliged
to
seek
by
other
means
well
said
bonaparte
impatiently
i
have
read
all
that
and
perfectly
understood
it
be
monk
labor
for
another
man
and
your
victories
your
renown
your
genius
will
be
forgiven
you
humble
yourself
and
you
shall
be
allowed
to
remain
great
citizen
first
consul
said
lord
tanlay
no
one
knows
better
than
i
the
difference
between
you
and
monk
and
how
far
you
surpass
him
in
genius
and
then
why
do
you
read
me
that
i
only
read
that
paragraph
replied
sir
john
to
lead
you
to
give
to
the
one
following
its
due
let
s
hear
it
said
bonaparte
with
repressed
impatience
sir
john
continued
but
however
desirable
such
an
event
may
be
for
france
and
for
the
world
it
is
not
to
this
means
alone
that
his
majesty
restricts
the
possibility
of
a
safe
and
sure
pacification
sir
john
emphasized
the
last
words
ah
ah
exclaimed
bonaparte
stepping
hastily
to
sir
john
s
side
the
englishman
continued
his
majesty
does
not
presume
to
prescribe
to
france
her
form
of
government
nor
the
hands
into
which
she
may
place
the
necessary
authority
to
conduct
the
affairs
of
a
great
and
powerful
nation
read
that
again
sir
said
bonaparte
eagerly
read
it
yourself
replied
sir
john
he
handed
him
the
note
and
bonaparte
it
was
it
you
sir
he
asked
who
added
that
paragraph
i
certainly
insisted
on
bonaparte
reflected
you
are
right
he
said
a
great
step
has
been
taken
the
return
of
the
bourbons
is
no
longer
a
condition
quâ
i
am
accepted
not
only
as
a
military
but
also
as
a
political
then
holding
out
his
hand
to
sir
john
he
added
have
you
anything
to
ask
of
me
sir
the
only
thing
i
seek
has
been
asked
of
you
by
my
friend
and
i
answered
sir
that
i
shall
be
pleased
to
see
you
the
husband
of
his
sister
if
i
were
richer
or
if
you
were
less
so
i
would
offer
to
dower
her
sir
john
made
a
motion
but
as
i
know
your
fortune
will
suffice
for
two
added
bonaparte
smiling
or
even
more
i
leave
you
the
joy
of
giving
not
only
happiness
but
also
wealth
to
the
woman
you
love
bourrienne
he
called
bourrienne
appeared
i
have
sent
it
general
he
said
very
good
replied
the
first
consul
but
that
is
not
what
i
called
you
i
await
your
at
whatever
hour
of
the
day
or
night
lord
tanlay
presents
himself
i
shall
be
happy
to
receive
him
without
delay
you
hear
me
my
dear
bourrienne
you
hear
me
my
lord
lord
tanlay
bowed
his
thanks
and
now
said
bonaparte
i
presume
you
are
in
a
hurry
to
be
off
to
the
château
des
i
won
t
detain
you
but
there
is
one
condition
i
and
that
is
general
if
i
need
you
for
another
mission
that
is
not
a
condition
citizen
first
consul
it
is
a
lord
tanlay
bowed
and
withdrew
bourrienne
prepared
to
follow
him
but
bonaparte
called
him
back
is
there
a
carriage
below
he
asked
bourrienne
looked
into
the
courtyard
yes
then
get
ready
and
come
with
i
am
ready
general
i
have
only
my
hat
and
overcoat
to
get
and
they
are
in
the
then
let
us
go
said
bonaparte
he
took
up
his
hat
and
coat
went
down
the
private
staircase
and
signed
to
the
carriage
to
come
up
notwithstanding
bourrienne
s
haste
he
got
down
after
him
a
footman
opened
the
door
bonaparte
sprang
in
where
are
we
going
general
asked
bourrienne
to
the
tuileries
replied
bonaparte
bourrienne
amazed
repeated
the
order
and
looked
at
the
first
consul
as
if
to
seek
an
explanation
but
the
latter
was
plunged
in
thought
and
the
secretary
who
at
this
time
was
still
the
friend
thought
it
best
not
to
disturb
him
the
horses
started
at
gallop
bonaparte
s
usual
mode
of
progression
and
took
the
way
to
the
tuileries
the
tuileries
inhabited
by
louis
xvi
after
the
days
of
the
and
of
october
and
occupied
successively
by
the
convention
and
the
council
of
five
hundred
had
remained
empty
and
devastated
since
the
brumaire
since
that
day
bonaparte
had
more
than
once
cast
his
eyes
on
that
ancient
palace
of
royalty
but
he
knew
the
importance
of
not
arousing
any
suspicion
that
a
future
king
might
dwell
in
the
palace
of
the
abolished
monarchy
bonaparte
had
brought
back
from
italy
a
magnificent
bust
of
junius
brutus
there
was
no
suitable
place
for
it
at
the
luxembourg
and
toward
the
end
of
november
bonaparte
had
sent
for
the
republican
david
and
ordered
him
to
place
the
bust
in
the
gallery
of
the
tuileries
who
could
suppose
that
david
the
friend
of
marat
was
preparing
the
dwelling
of
a
future
emperor
by
placing
the
bust
of
cæsar
s
murderer
in
the
gallery
of
the
tuileries
no
one
did
suppose
nor
even
suspect
it
when
bonaparte
went
to
see
if
the
bust
were
properly
placed
he
noticed
the
havoc
committed
in
the
palace
of
catherine
of
medicis
the
tuileries
were
no
longer
the
abode
of
kings
it
is
true
but
they
were
a
national
palace
and
the
nation
could
not
allow
one
of
its
palaces
to
become
dilapidated
bonaparte
sent
for
citizen
lecomte
the
architect
and
ordered
him
to
the
tuileries
the
word
might
be
taken
in
both
senses
moral
and
physical
the
architect
was
requested
to
send
in
an
estimate
of
the
cost
of
the
cleaning
it
amounted
to
five
hundred
thousand
francs
bonaparte
asked
if
for
that
sum
the
tuileries
could
be
converted
into
a
suitable
palace
for
the
the
architect
replied
that
the
sum
named
would
suffice
not
only
to
restore
the
tuileries
to
their
former
condition
but
to
make
them
habitable
a
habitable
palace
that
was
all
bonaparte
wanted
how
should
he
a
republican
need
regal
luxury
the
palace
of
the
government
ought
to
be
severely
plain
decorated
with
marbles
and
statues
only
but
what
ought
those
statues
to
be
it
was
the
first
consul
s
duty
to
select
them
accordingly
bonaparte
chose
them
from
the
three
great
ages
and
the
three
great
nations
from
the
greeks
from
the
romans
from
france
and
her
rivals
from
the
greeks
he
chose
alexander
and
demosthenes
the
genius
of
conquest
and
the
genius
of
eloquence
from
the
romans
he
chose
scipio
cicero
cato
brutus
and
cæsar
placing
the
great
victim
side
by
side
with
the
murderer
as
great
almost
as
himself
from
the
modern
world
he
chose
gustavus
adolphus
turenne
the
great
condé
marlborough
prince
eugene
and
the
maréchal
de
saxe
and
finally
the
great
frederick
and
george
washington
false
philosophy
upon
a
throne
and
true
wisdom
founding
a
free
state
to
these
he
added
warlike
heroes
dampierre
dugommier
joubert
to
prove
that
while
he
did
not
fear
the
memory
of
a
bourbon
in
the
great
condé
neither
was
he
jealous
of
his
the
victims
of
a
cause
already
no
longer
his
matters
were
in
this
state
at
the
period
of
which
we
are
now
speaking
that
is
the
last
of
february
the
tuileries
had
been
cleaned
the
busts
were
in
their
niches
the
statues
were
on
their
pedestals
and
only
a
favorable
occasion
was
wanting
that
occasion
came
when
the
news
of
washington
s
death
was
received
the
founder
of
the
liberty
of
the
united
states
had
ceased
to
breathe
on
the
of
december
it
was
that
event
of
which
bonaparte
was
thinking
when
bourrienne
saw
by
the
expression
of
his
face
that
he
must
be
left
entirely
to
the
reflections
which
absorbed
him
the
carriage
stopped
before
the
tuileries
bonaparte
sprang
out
with
the
same
haste
with
which
he
had
entered
it
went
rapidly
up
the
stairs
and
through
the
apartments
examining
more
particularly
those
which
had
been
inhabited
by
louis
xvi
and
in
the
private
study
of
louis
xvi
he
stopped
short
here
s
where
we
will
live
bourrienne
he
said
suddenly
as
if
the
latter
had
followed
him
through
the
mental
labyrinth
in
which
he
wandered
following
the
thread
of
ariadne
which
we
call
thought
yes
we
will
lodge
here
the
third
consul
can
have
the
pavilion
of
flora
and
cambacérès
will
remain
at
the
in
that
way
said
bourrienne
when
the
time
comes
you
will
have
only
one
to
turn
come
come
said
bonaparte
catching
bourrienne
by
the
ear
that
s
not
when
shall
we
move
in
general
asked
bourrienne
oh
not
it
will
take
at
least
a
week
to
prepare
the
parisians
to
see
me
leave
the
luxembourg
for
the
eight
days
exclaimed
bourrienne
that
will
especially
if
we
begin
at
once
come
bourrienne
to
the
with
the
rapidity
that
characterized
all
his
movements
when
serious
matters
were
in
question
he
passed
through
the
suites
of
apartments
he
had
already
visited
ran
down
the
stairs
and
sprang
into
the
carriage
calling
out
to
the
luxembourg
wait
wait
cried
bourrienne
still
in
the
vestibule
general
won
t
you
wait
for
me
laggard
exclaimed
bonaparte
and
the
carriage
started
as
it
had
come
at
a
gallop
when
bonaparte
his
study
he
found
the
minister
of
police
awaiting
him
well
what
now
citizen
fouché
you
look
upset
have
i
perchance
been
assassinated
citizen
first
consul
said
the
minister
you
seemed
to
attach
the
utmost
importance
to
the
destruction
of
those
bands
who
call
themselves
the
companions
of
evidently
since
i
sent
roland
himself
to
pursue
them
have
you
any
news
of
them
we
from
whom
their
leader
their
leader
he
has
had
the
audacity
to
send
me
a
report
of
their
last
against
whom
the
fifty
thousand
francs
you
sent
to
the
what
became
of
them
the
fifty
thousand
francs
they
are
in
the
possession
of
those
brigands
and
their
leader
informs
me
he
will
transfer
them
shortly
to

killed
how
do
you
mean
no
my
agent
is
killed
colonel
maurice

but

bonaparte
what

perfumed
envelope
what

the
thing

asked

that

was
good
enough
to

write

that
roland
de
montrevel
is
just

too
much
occupied
in
pursuing
us
to
write
you
himself
but
i
am
sure
that

leisure
moment
you
will
receive
from

a
report
containing
all

i
can
not
enter
for

of
time
and
facilities
for
writing
in
exchange
for

render

for

on

road
from

said
bonaparte
a
bold
scamp
then
he
added
with
a
sigh
what
colonels
and
captains
those
men
would
make
me
what
are
your
orders
citizen
first
consul
asked
the
minister
of

none
that

his

is
at
stake
and
as
he
is
not

he
will

the
first
consul
left
alone
with
bourrienne
dictated
the
following
order
addressed
to
the
consulate
guard
and
to
the
army
at
large
washington
is
dead
that
great
man
fought
against
tyranny
he
consolidated
the
liberty
of
america
his
memory
will
ever
be
dear
to
the
french
people
to
all
free
men
in
both
hemispheres
but
especially
to
the
french
soldiers
who
like
washington
and
his
soldiers
have
fought
for
liberty
and
equality
consequently
the
first
consul
orders
that
the
flags
and
banners
of
the
republic
shall
be
hung
with
crape
for
ten
days
but
the
first
consul
did
not
intend
to
confine
himself
to
this
order
of
the
day
among
the
means
he
took
to
facilitate
his
removal
from
the
luxembourg
to
the
tuileries
was
one
of
those
fêtes
by
which
he
knew
none
better
how
to
amuse
the
eyes
and
also
direct
the
minds
of
the
spectator
this
fête
was
to
take
place
at
the
invalides
or
as
they
said
in
those
days
the
temple
of
mars
a
bust
of
washington
was
to
be
crowned
and
the
flags
of
aboukir
were
to
be
received
from
the
hands
of
general
lannes
it
was
one
of
those
combinations
which
bonaparte
thoroughly
understood
a
flash
of
lightning
drawn
from
the
contact
of
contrasting
facts
he
presented
the
great
man
of
the
new
world
and
a
great
victory
of
the
old
young
america
coupled
with
the
palms
of
thebes
and
memphis
on
the
day
fixed
for
the
ceremony
six
thousand
cavalry
were
in
line
from
the
luxembourg
to
the
invalides
at
eight
o
clock
bonaparte
mounted
his
horse
in
the
main
courtyard
of
the
consular
palace
issuing
by
the
rue
de
tournon
he
took
the
line
of
the
quays
accompanied
by
a
staff
of
generals
none
of
whom
were
over
years
of
age
lannes
headed
the
procession
behind
him
were
sixty
guides
bearing
the
sixty
captured
flags
then
came
bonaparte
about
two
horse
ahead
of
his
staff
the
minister
of
war
berthier
awaited
the
procession
under
the
dome
of
the
temple
he
leaned
against
a
statue
of
mars
at
rest
and
the
ministers
and
councillors
of
state
were
grouped
around
him
the
flags
of
denain
and
fontenoy
and
those
of
the
first
campaign
in
italy
were
already
suspended
from
the
columns
which
supported
the
roof
two
centenarian
invalids
who
had
fought
beside
maréchal
saxe
were
standing
one
to
the
right
and
one
to
the
left
of
berthier
like
caryatides
of
an
ancient
world
gazing
across
the
centuries
to
the
right
on
a
raised
platform
was
the
bust
of
washington
which
was
now
to
be
draped
with
the
flags
of
aboukir
on
another
platform
opposite
to
the
former
stood
bonaparte
s
armchair
on
each
side
of
the
temple
were
tiers
of
seats
in
which
was
gathered
all
the
elegant
society
of
paris
or
rather
that
portion
of
it
which
gave
its
adhesion
to
the
order
of
ideas
then
to
be
celebrated
when
the
flags
appeared
the
trumpets
blared
their
metallic
sounds
echoing
through
the
arches
of
the
temple
lannes
entered
first
at
a
sign
from
him
the
guides
mounted
two
by
two
the
steps
of
the
platform
and
placed
the
staffs
of
the
flags
in
the
holders
prepared
for
them
during
this
time
bonaparte
took
his
place
in
the
chair
then
lannes
advanced
to
the
minister
of
war
and
in
that
voice
that
rang
out
so
clearly
on
the
battlefield
crying
forward
he
said
citizen
minister
these
are
the
flags
of
the
ottoman
army
destroyed
before
your
eyes
at
aboukir
the
army
of
egypt
after
crossing
burning
deserts
surviving
thirst
and
hunger
found
itself
before
an
enemy
proud
of
his
numbers
and
his
victories
and
believing
that
he
saw
an
easy
prey
in
our
troops
exhausted
by
their
march
and
incessant
combats
he
had
yet
to
learn
that
the
french
soldier
is
greater
because
he
knows
how
to
suffer
than
because
he
knows
how
to
vanquish
and
that
his
courage
rises
and
augments
in
danger
three
thousand
frenchmen
as
you
know
fell
upon
eighteen
thousand
barbarians
broke
their
ranks
forced
them
back
pressed
them
between
our
lines
and
the
sea
and
the
terror
of
our
bayonets
is
such
that
the
mussulmans
driven
to
choose
a
death
rushed
into
the
depths
of
the
mediterranean
on
that
memorable
day
hung
the
destinies
of
egypt
france
and
europe
and
they
were
saved
by
your
courage
allied
powers
if
you
dare
to
violate
french
territory
and
if
the
general
who
was
given
back
to
us
by
the
victory
of
aboukir
makes
an
appeal
to
the
nation
allied
powers
i
say
to
you
that
your
successes
would
be
more
fatal
to
you
than
disasters
what
frenchman
is
there
who
would
not
march
to
victory
again
under
the
banners
of
the
first
consul
or
serve
his
apprenticeship
to
fame
with
him
then
addressing
the
invalids
for
whom
the
whole
lower
gallery
had
been
reserved
he
continued
in
a
still
more
powerful
voice
and
you
brave
veterans
honorable
victims
of
the
fate
of
battles
you
will
not
be
the
last
to
flock
under
the
orders
of
him
who
knows
your
misfortunes
and
your
glory
and
who
now
delivers
to
your
keeping
these
trophies
won
by
your
valor
ah
i
know
you
veterans
you
burn
to
sacrifice
the
half
of
your
remaining
lives
to
your
country
and
its
freedom
this
specimen
of
the
military
eloquence
of
the
conqueror
of
montebello
was
received
with
deafening
applause
three
times
the
minister
of
war
endeavored
to
make
reply
and
three
times
the
bravos
cut
him
short
at
last
however
silence
came
and
berthier
expressed
himself
as
follows
to
raise
on
the
banks
of
the
seine
these
trophies
won
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
to
hang
beneath
the
domes
of
our
temples
beside
the
flags
of
vienna
of
petersburg
of
london
the
banners
blessed
in
the
mosques
of
byzantium
and
cairo
to
see
them
here
presented
by
the
same
warriors
young
in
years
old
in
glory
whom
victory
has
so
often
crowned
these
things
are
granted
only
to
republican
france
yet
this
is
but
a
part
of
what
he
has
done
that
hero
in
the
flower
of
his
age
covered
with
the
laurels
of
europe
he
who
stood
a
victor
before
the
pyramids
from
the
summits
of
which
forty
centuries
looked
down
upon
him
while
surrounded
by
his
warriors
and
learned
men
he
emancipated
the
native
soil
of
art
and
restored
to
it
the
lights
of
civilization
soldiers
plant
in
this
temple
of
the
warrior
virtues
those
ensigns
of
the
crescent
captured
on
the
rocks
of
canopus
by
three
thousand
frenchmen
from
eighteen
thousand
ottomans
as
brave
as
they
were
barbarous
let
them
bear
witness
not
to
the
valor
of
the
french
soldier
the
universe
itself
resounds
to
that
but
to
his
unalterable
constancy
his
sublime
devotion
let
the
sight
of
these
banners
console
you
veteran
warriors
you
whose
bodies
gloriously
mutilated
on
the
field
of
honor
deprive
your
courage
of
other
exercise
than
hope
and
prayer
let
them
proclaim
from
that
dome
above
us
to
all
the
enemies
of
france
the
influence
of
genius
the
value
of
the
heroes
who
captured
them
forewarning
of
the
horrors
of
war
all
those
who
are
deaf
to
our
offers
of
peace
yes
if
they
will
have
war
they
shall
have
it
war
terrible
and
unrelenting
the
nation
satisfied
regards
the
army
of
the
east
with
pride
that
invincible
army
will
learn
with
joy
that
the
first
consul
is
watchful
of
its
glory
it
is
the
object
of
the
keenest
solicitude
on
the
part
of
the
republic
it
will
hear
with
pride
that
we
have
honored
it
in
our
temples
while
awaiting
the
moment
when
we
shall
imitate
if
need
be
on
the
fields
of
europe
the
warlike
virtues
it
has
displayed
on
the
burning
sands
of
africa
and
asia
come
in
the
name
of
that
army
intrepid
general
come
in
the
name
of
those
heroes
among
whom
you
now
appear
and
receive
an
embrace
in
token
of
the
national
gratitude
and
in
the
moment
when
we
again
take
up
our
arms
in
defence
of
our
independence
if
the
blind
fury
of
kings
refuses
the
peace
we
offer
let
us
cast
a
branch
of
laurel
on
the
ashes
of
washington
that
hero
who
freed
america
from
the
yoke
of
our
worst
and
most
implacable
enemy
let
his
illustrious
shade
tell
us
of
the
glory
which
follows
a
nation
s
liberator
beyond
the
grave
bonaparte
now
came
down
from
his
platform
and
in
the
name
of
france
was
embraced
by
berthier
de
fontanes
who
was
appointed
to
pronounce
the
eulogy
on
washington
waited
courteously
until
the
echoes
of
the
torrent
of
applause
which
seemed
to
fall
in
cascades
through
the
vast
amphitheatre
had
died
away
in
the
midst
of
these
glorious
individualities
de
fontanes
was
a
curiosity
half
political
half
literary
after
the
fructidor
he
was
proscribed
with
suard
and
laharpe
but
being
perfectly
hidden
in
a
friend
s
house
and
never
going
out
except
at
night
he
managed
to
avoid
leaving
france
nevertheless
an
accident
impossible
to
foresee
had
betrayed
him
he
was
knocked
down
one
night
on
the
place
du
carrousel
by
a
runaway
horse
and
was
recognized
by
a
policeman
who
ran
to
his
assistance
but
fouché
who
was
at
once
informed
not
only
of
his
presence
in
france
but
also
of
his
actual
pretended
to
know
nothing
of
him
a
few
days
after
the
brumaire
maret
who
became
later
the
duc
de
bassano
laplace
who
continued
to
be
simply
a
man
of
science
and
regnault
de
angely
who
died
mad
spoke
to
the
first
consul
of
de
fontanes
and
of
his
presence
in
paris
present
him
to
me
replied
the
first
consul
simply
de
fontanes
was
presented
to
bonaparte
who
recognizing
his
supple
nature
and
the
unctuous
flattery
of
his
eloquence
chose
him
to
deliver
the
eulogy
on
washington
and
perhaps
something
of
his
own
at
the
same
time
de
fontanes
address
was
too
long
to
be
reported
here
all
that
we
shall
say
about
it
is
that
it
was
precisely
what
bonaparte
desired
that
evening
there
was
a
grand
reception
at
the
luxembourg
during
the
ceremony
a
rumor
was
spread
that
the
first
consul
contemplated
removing
to
the
tuileries
persons
who
were
either
bold
or
curious
ventured
on
a
few
words
to
josephine
she
poor
woman
who
still
saw
before
her
the
tumbrel
and
the
scaffold
of
marie
antoinette
had
an
instinctive
horror
of
all
that
might
connect
her
with
royalty
she
therefore
hesitated
to
reply
and
referred
all
questions
to
her
husband
then
another
rumor
began
to
be
bruited
about
which
served
as
a
counterpoise
to
the
former
murat
it
was
said
had
asked
the
hand
of
mademoiselle
caroline
bonaparte
in
marriage
but
this
marriage
was
not
without
its
obstacles
bonaparte
had
had
a
quarrel
lasting
over
a
year
with
the
man
who
aspired
to
the
honor
of
becoming
his
the
cause
of
this
quarrel
will
seem
rather
strange
to
our
readers
murat
the
lion
of
the
army
murat
whose
courage
had
become
proverbial
murat
who
might
well
have
been
taken
by
a
sculptor
as
a
model
for
the
god
of
war
murat
on
one
occasion
when
he
must
have
slept
ill
or
breakfasted
badly
had
a
moment
of
weakness
it
happened
before
mantua
in
which
city
wurmser
after
the
battle
of
rivoli
was
forced
to
shut
himself
up
with
thousand
men
general
miollis
with
four
thousand
only
was
investing
the
place
during
a
sortie
attempted
by
the
austrians
murat
at
the
head
of
five
hundred
men
received
an
order
to
charge
three
thousand
murat
charged
but
feebly
bonaparte
whose
he
then
was
was
so
irritated
that
he
would
not
suffer
him
to
remain
about
him
this
was
a
great
blow
to
murat
all
the
more
because
he
was
at
that
time
desirous
of
becoming
the
general
s
he
was
deeply
in
love
with
caroline
bonaparte
how
had
that
love
come
about
it
can
be
told
in
two
words
perhaps
those
who
read
our
books
singly
are
surprised
that
we
sometimes
dwell
on
certain
details
which
seem
somewhat
long
drawn
out
for
the
book
in
which
they
appear
the
fact
is
we
are
not
writing
isolated
books
but
as
we
have
already
said
we
are
filling
or
trying
to
fill
an
immense
frame
to
us
the
presence
of
our
characters
is
not
limited
to
their
appearance
in
one
book
the
man
you
meet
in
one
book
may
be
a
king
in
a
second
volume
and
exiled
or
shot
in
a
third
balzac
did
a
great
and
noble
work
with
a
hundred
aspects
and
he
called
it
the
comédie
our
work
begun
at
the
same
time
as
his
although
be
it
understood
we
do
not
praise
it
may
fitly
be
called
the
drama
of
now
let
us
return
to
murat
and
tell
how
this
love
which
had
so
glorious
and
possibly
so
fatal
an
influence
on
his
destiny
came
to
him
in
murat
was
sent
to
paris
charged
with
the
duty
of
presenting
to
the
directory
the
flags
and
banners
taken
by
the
french
army
at
the
battles
of
dego
and
mondovi
during
this
voyage
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
madame
bonaparte
and
madame
tallien
at
madame
bonaparte
s
house
he
again
met
mademoiselle
caroline
bonaparte
we
say
for
that
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
met
the
woman
who
was
to
share
the
crown
of
naples
with
him
they
had
met
in
rome
at
her
brother
s
house
and
in
spite
of
the
rivalry
of
a
young
and
handsome
roman
prince
she
had
shown
him
a
marked
preference
the
three
women
combined
to
obtain
for
him
the
rank
of
general
of
brigade
from
the
directory
murat
returned
to
the
army
of
italy
more
in
love
than
ever
and
in
spite
of
his
new
rank
he
solicited
and
obtained
the
favor
of
remaining
with
the
as
unhappily
the
fatal
sortie
took
place
soon
after
in
consequence
of
which
he
fell
in
disgrace
with
bonaparte
this
disgrace
had
for
awhile
all
the
characteristics
of
actual
enmity
bonaparte
dismissed
him
from
his
service
as
and
transferred
him
to
neille
s
division
and
then
to
that
of
hilliers
the
result
was
that
when
bonaparte
returned
to
paris
after
the
treaty
of
tolentino
murat
did
not
accompany
him
this
did
not
at
all
suit
the
female
triumvirate
who
had
taken
the
young
general
under
its
direction
the
beautiful
intriguers
entered
into
the
campaign
and
as
the
expedition
to
egypt
was
then
preparing
they
induced
the
minister
of
war
to
send
murat
with
it
he
embarked
in
the
same
ship
as
bonaparte
namely
the
orient
but
the
latter
did
not
address
a
single
word
to
him
during
the
voyage
after
they
reached
alexandria
murat
was
at
first
unable
to
break
the
icy
barrier
opposed
to
him
by
the
general
who
more
to
put
him
at
a
distance
from
his
own
person
than
to
give
him
an
opportunity
to
distinguish
himself
confronted
him
with
mourad
bey
but
during
that
campaign
murat
performed
such
prodigies
of
valor
that
he
effaced
by
such
bravery
the
memory
of
that
momentary
weakness
he
charged
so
intrepidly
so
madly
at
aboukir
that
bonaparte
had
not
the
heart
to
bear
him
further
malice
consequently
murat
had
returned
to
france
with
bonaparte
he
had
powerfully
with
him
on
the
and
especially
on
the
brumaire
he
was
therefore
restored
to
full
favor
and
as
a
proof
of
that
favor
had
received
the
command
of
the
consular
guard
he
thought
this
the
moment
to
declare
his
love
a
love
already
to
josephine
who
favored
it
for
which
she
had
two
reasons
in
the
first
place
she
was
a
woman
in
the
most
charming
acceptation
of
the
word
that
is
to
say
all
the
gentler
passions
of
women
were
attractive
to
her
joachim
loved
caroline
caroline
loved
joachim
that
was
enough
to
make
her
wish
to
protect
their
love
in
the
second
place
bonaparte
s
brothers
detested
josephine
joseph
and
lucien
were
her
bitterest
enemies
and
she
was
not
sorry
to
make
herself
two
ardent
friends
in
caroline
and
murat
she
therefore
encouraged
the
latter
to
approach
bonaparte
on
the
subject
three
days
before
the
ceremony
we
have
just
described
murat
had
entered
bonaparte
s
study
and
after
endless
hesitation
and
circumlocution
had
proffered
his
request
it
is
probable
that
the
love
of
the
young
pair
was
no
news
to
bonaparte
who
however
received
it
with
stern
gravity
and
contented
himself
with
replying
that
he
would
think
it
over
the
matter
in
fact
required
thinking
over
bonaparte
came
of
a
noble
family
murat
was
the
son
of
an
innkeeper
the
alliance
at
such
a
moment
might
have
great
significance
was
the
first
consul
in
spite
of
his
noble
birth
in
spite
of
the
exalted
rank
to
which
he
had
raised
himself
not
only
sufficiently
republican
but
also
sufficiently
democratic
to
mingle
his
blood
with
that
of
the
common
people
he
did
not
reflect
long
his
strong
good
sense
and
his
logical
mind
told
him
that
he
had
every
interest
in
allowing
the
marriage
and
he
gave
his
consent
to
it
the
same
day
the
double
news
of
this
marriage
and
of
the
removal
to
the
tuileries
was
launched
on
the
public
at
the
same
time
the
one
was
to
counterpoise
the
other
the
first
consul
was
about
to
occupy
the
palace
of
the
former
kings
to
sleep
in
the
bed
of
the
bourbons
as
they
said
at
that
time
but
he
gave
his
sister
to
the
son
of
an
innkeeper
and
now
it
may
be
asked
what
dowry
did
the
future
queen
of
naples
bring
to
the
hero
of
aboukir
thirty
thousand
francs
and
a
diamond
necklace
which
the
first
consul
took
from
his
wife
being
too
poor
to
buy
one
josephine
who
was
very
fond
of
her
necklace
pouted
a
little
but
the
gift
thus
obtained
was
a
triumphant
reply
to
those
who
claimed
that
bonaparte
had
made
a
fortune
in
italy
besides
why
had
she
taken
the
interests
of
the
young
couple
so
to
heart
she
had
insisted
on
marrying
them
and
she
ought
to
contribute
to
the
dowry
the
result
of
this
clever
combination
was
that
on
the
day
when
the
consuls
left
the
luxembourg
for
the
palace
of
the
government
escorted
by
the
of
an
soon
to
be
bonaparte
s
it
did
not
occur
to
those
who
saw
the
procession
pass
to
do
otherwise
than
admire
and
applaud
and
in
truth
what
could
be
more
admirable
and
worthy
of
applause
than
those
processions
which
had
at
their
head
such
men
as
murat
moreau
junot
duroc
augereau
and
masséna
a
grand
review
had
been
ordered
to
take
place
that
same
day
in
the
square
of
the
carrousel
madame
bonaparte
was
to
be
present
not
to
be
sure
in
the
balcony
of
the
that
being
evidently
too
royal
but
at
the
window
of
lebrun
s
apartment
in
the
pavilion
of
flora
bonaparte
started
at
one
o
clock
precisely
from
the
luxembourg
escorted
by
three
thousand
picked
men
among
them
the
splendid
regiment
of
the
guides
created
three
years
earlier
as
a
bodyguard
to
bonaparte
during
the
italian
campaign
in
consequence
of
a
great
danger
he
had
escaped
on
one
occasion
he
was
resting
in
a
small
château
after
the
exhaustion
attendant
upon
the
passage
of
the
mincio
and
was
preparing
to
take
a
bath
when
a
retreating
austrian
detachment
losing
its
way
invaded
the
château
which
had
no
other
guard
than
the
sentries
bonaparte
had
barely
time
to
escape
in
his
shirt
a
curious
difficulty
which
deserves
to
be
recorded
arose
on
the
morning
of
this
removal
which
took
place
the
pluviose
year
viii
the
generals
of
course
had
their
horses
and
the
ministers
their
carriages
but
the
other
functionaries
had
not
yet
judged
it
expedient
to
go
to
such
an
expense
carriages
were
therefore
lacking
they
were
supplied
from
the
hackney
and
slips
of
paper
of
the
same
color
as
the
carriages
were
pasted
over
their
numbers
the
carriage
of
the
first
consul
alone
was
harnessed
with
six
white
horses
but
as
the
three
consuls
were
in
the
same
carriage
bonaparte
and
cambacérès
on
the
front
seat
and
lebrun
on
the
back
it
was
after
all
but
two
horses
apiece
besides
were
not
these
six
white
horses
given
to
the
by
the
emperor
francis
himself
after
the
treaty
of
a
trophy
in
themselves
the
carriage
crossed
a
part
of
paris
following
the
rue
de
thionville
the
quai
voltaire
and
the
from
the
archway
of
the
carrousel
to
the
great
portal
of
the
tuileries
the
consular
guard
lined
the
way
as
bonaparte
passed
through
the
archway
he
raised
his
head
and
read
the
inscription
it
bore
that
inscription
was
as
follows
august
royalty
is
abolished
in
france
and
shall
never
rise
again
an
almost
imperceptible
smile
flickered
on
the
first
consul
s
lips
at
the
door
of
the
tuileries
bonaparte
left
the
carriage
and
sprang
into
the
saddle
to
review
the
troops
when
he
appeared
on
his
the
applause
burst
forth
wildly
on
all
sides
after
the
review
was
over
he
placed
himself
in
front
of
the
with
murat
on
his
right
lannes
at
his
left
and
the
glorious
staff
of
the
army
of
italy
behind
him
then
began
the
march
past
and
now
it
was
that
one
of
those
inspirations
came
to
him
which
engrave
themselves
forever
on
the
hearts
of
soldiers
as
the
flags
of
the
the
and
the
were
borne
past
him
and
he
saw
that
of
those
banners
there
remained
but
a
stick
and
a
few
rags
riddled
with
balls
and
blackened
with
powder
he
took
his
hat
from
his
head
and
bowed
then
when
the
march
was
over
he
dismounted
from
his
horse
and
with
a
firm
step
he
walked
up
the
grand
stairway
of
the
valois
and
the
bourbons
that
night
when
he
was
alone
with
bourrienne
the
latter
asked
well
general
are
you
satisfied
yes
replied
bonaparte
dreamily
everything
went
off
nicely
didn
t
it
wonderfully
i
saw
you
standing
near
madame
bonaparte
at
the
window
of
the
pavilion
of
i
saw
you
too
general
you
were
reading
the
inscription
on
the
arch
of
the
yes
said
bonaparte
august
royalty
is
abolished
in
france
and
shall
never
rise
shall
i
have
it
removed
asked
bourrienne
useless
replied
the
first
consul
it
will
fall
of
then
with
a
sigh
he
added
bourrienne
do
you
know
whom
i
missed
no
roland
what
the
devil
is
he
doing
that
he
doesn
t
give
me
any
news
of
himself
we
are
about
to
see
what
roland
was
doing
chapter
xlv
the
follower
of
trails
the
reader
will
not
have
forgotten
the
situation
in
which
the
escort
of
chasseurs
found
the
chambéry
the
first
thing
they
did
was
to
look
for
the
obstacle
which
prevented
roland
from
getting
out
they
found
the
padlock
and
wrenched
off
the
door
roland
bounded
from
the
coach
like
a
tiger
from
its
cage
we
have
said
that
the
ground
was
covered
with
snow
roland
hunter
and
soldier
had
but
one
idea
to
follow
the
trail
of
the
companions
of
jehu
he
had
seen
them
disappear
in
the
direction
of
thoissy
but
he
believed
they
were
not
likely
to
continue
in
that
direction
because
between
them
and
the
little
town
ran
the
saône
and
there
were
no
bridges
across
the
river
between
belleville
and
mâcon
he
ordered
the
escort
and
the
conductor
to
wait
for
him
on
the
highroad
and
alone
and
on
foot
without
even
waiting
to
reload
his
pistols
he
started
on
the
tracks
of
morgan
and
his
companions
he
was
not
mistaken
a
mile
from
the
highroad
the
fugitives
had
come
to
the
river
there
they
had
halted
probably
deliberating
for
the
trampling
of
their
horses
hoofs
was
plainly
visible
then
they
had
separated
into
two
troops
one
going
up
the
river
to
mâcon
and
the
other
descending
it
in
the
direction
of
belleville
this
separation
was
doubtless
intended
to
puzzle
their
pursuers
if
they
were
pursued
roland
had
heard
the
parting
call
of
the
leader
night
you
know
where
he
had
no
doubt
therefore
that
whichever
trail
he
followed
whether
up
or
down
if
the
snow
did
not
melt
too
fast
would
lead
him
to
the
rendezvous
where
either
together
or
singly
the
companions
of
jehu
were
certain
to
assemble
he
returned
upon
his
own
tracks
ordered
the
conductor
to
put
on
the
boots
thrown
aside
by
the
pretended
postilion
mount
the
horse
and
take
the
coach
to
the
next
relay
namely
belleville
the
sergeant
of
chasseurs
and
four
of
his
men
who
knew
how
to
write
were
to
accompany
the
conductor
and
sign
his
report
of
what
had
occurred
roland
forbade
all
mention
of
himself
and
where
he
had
gone
lest
the
brigands
should
get
word
of
his
future
plans
the
rest
of
the
escort
were
to
carry
back
their
colonel
s
body
and
make
deposition
on
their
own
account
along
the
same
lines
as
the
conductor
to
the
authorities
and
equally
without
mention
of
roland
these
orders
given
the
young
man
dismounted
a
chasseur
and
took
his
horse
selecting
the
one
he
thought
most
serviceable
then
he
reloaded
his
pistols
and
put
them
in
the
holsters
in
place
of
the
regulation
weapons
of
the
dismounted
chasseur
having
done
this
and
promised
the
conductor
and
the
chasseurs
a
speedy
vengeance
conditioned
however
on
their
keeping
his
present
proceedings
secret
he
mounted
the
horse
and
rode
off
in
the
direction
he
had
already
investigated
when
he
reached
the
spot
where
the
two
troops
had
separated
he
had
to
decide
between
the
different
trails
he
chose
that
which
descended
the
saône
toward
belleville
he
had
excellent
reason
for
making
this
choice
although
it
might
possibly
take
him
out
of
his
way
for
six
or
eight
miles
in
the
first
place
he
was
nearer
belleville
than
mâcon
then
he
had
spent
hours
at
mâcon
and
might
be
recognized
there
whereas
he
had
never
stopped
at
belleville
longer
than
the
time
required
to
change
horses
when
accident
brought
him
there
by
post
the
events
we
have
just
recorded
had
taken
barely
an
hour
to
happen
eight
o
clock
was
striking
from
the
church
clock
at
thoissy
when
roland
started
in
pursuit
of
the
fugitives
the
way
was
plain
five
or
six
horses
had
left
their
imprint
on
the
snow
one
of
these
horses
had
paced
roland
jumped
the
two
or
three
brooks
which
watered
the
space
he
had
to
cross
to
reach
belleville
a
hundred
yards
from
the
town
he
paused
for
here
the
trail
separated
again
two
of
the
six
travellers
had
turned
to
the
right
that
is
to
say
they
had
struck
away
from
the
river
the
four
others
to
the
left
continuing
on
their
way
to
belleville
at
the
outskirts
of
the
town
another
secession
had
taken
place
three
of
the
riders
had
gone
round
the
town
one
had
entered
it
roland
followed
the
latter
sure
that
he
could
recover
the
traces
of
the
others
the
one
who
had
entered
the
town
and
followed
the
main
street
had
stopped
at
a
pretty
house
between
court
and
garden
numbered
he
had
rung
and
some
one
had
let
him
in
for
through
the
iron
grating
could
be
seen
traces
of
footsteps
and
beside
them
the
tracks
of
a
horse
being
led
to
the
stable
it
was
quite
evident
that
one
at
least
of
the
companions
of
jehu
had
stopped
there
by
going
to
the
mayor
of
the
town
exhibiting
his
authority
and
asking
for
gendarmes
roland
could
have
arrested
him
at
once
but
that
was
not
his
object
he
did
not
wish
to
arrest
a
solitary
individual
he
wanted
to
catch
the
whole
company
in
a
trap
he
made
a
note
in
his
mind
of
no
and
continued
on
his
way
he
crossed
the
entire
town
and
rode
a
few
hundred
paces
beyond
it
without
meeting
any
fresh
traces
he
was
about
to
return
when
it
occurred
to
him
that
if
the
tracks
of
the
three
riders
reappeared
anywhere
it
would
be
at
the
head
of
the
bridge
and
there
sure
enough
he
found
the
of
three
horses
which
were
undoubtedly
those
he
sought
for
one
of
them
paced
roland
galloped
in
pursuit
on
reaching
monceaux
same
precaution
the
riders
had
skirted
the
village
but
roland
was
too
good
a
scout
to
trouble
himself
about
that
he
kept
on
his
way
and
at
the
other
end
of
monceaux
he
recovered
the
fugitives
tracks
not
far
from
châtillon
one
of
the
three
horses
had
left
the
highroad
turning
to
the
right
toward
a
little
château
standing
on
a
hill
a
short
distance
from
the
road
between
châtillon
and
trévoux
this
time
the
three
remaining
riders
evidently
believing
they
had
done
enough
to
mislead
any
one
who
might
be
following
had
kept
straight
on
through
châtillon
and
taken
the
road
to
neuville
the
direction
taken
by
the
fugitives
was
eminently
satisfactory
to
roland
they
were
undoubtedly
on
their
way
to
bourg
if
they
had
not
intended
to
go
there
they
would
have
taken
the
road
to
marlieux
now
bourg
was
the
headquarters
roland
had
himself
chosen
for
the
centre
of
his
own
operations
it
was
his
own
town
and
he
knew
with
the
minuteness
of
boyish
knowledge
every
bush
every
ruin
every
cavern
in
the
neighborhood
at
neuville
the
riders
had
skirted
the
village
roland
did
not
trouble
himself
about
a
ruse
already
known
and
thwarted
but
on
the
other
side
he
found
but
one
trail
he
could
not
be
mistaken
in
that
horse
however
it
was
the
pacer
certain
of
recovering
the
trail
again
roland
retraced
his
steps
the
two
riders
had
separated
at
a
road
leading
off
to
vannes
one
had
taken
that
road
the
other
had
skirted
the
village
which
as
we
have
said
was
on
the
road
to
bourg
this
was
the
one
to
follow
besides
the
gait
of
the
horse
made
it
easier
as
it
could
not
be
confused
with
any
other
moreover
he
was
on
his
way
to
bourg
and
between
neuville
and
bourg
there
was
but
one
other
village
that
of
for
the
rest
it
was
not
probable
that
the
solitary
rider
intended
to
go
further
than
bourg
roland
continued
on
his
way
with
more
eagerness
than
ever
convinced
that
he
was
nearing
the
end
in
fact
the
rider
had
not
skirted
bourg
but
had
boldly
entered
the
town
there
it
seemed
to
roland
that
the
man
had
hesitated
unless
this
hesitation
were
a
last
ruse
to
hide
his
tracks
but
after
ten
minutes
spent
in
following
his
devious
tracks
roland
was
sure
of
his
facts
it
was
not
trickery
but
hesitation
the
print
of
a
man
s
steps
came
from
a
side
street
the
traveller
and
the
pedestrian
had
conferred
together
for
a
moment
and
then
the
former
had
evidently
employed
the
latter
as
a
guide
from
that
point
on
the
footsteps
of
a
man
went
side
by
side
with
those
of
the
horse
both
came
to
an
end
at
the
hôtel
de
la
roland
remembered
that
the
horse
wounded
in
the
attack
at
les
carronnières
had
been
brought
to
this
inn
in
all
probability
there
was
some
connivance
between
the
and
the
companion
of
jehu
for
the
rest
in
all
probability
the
rider
would
stay
there
until
the
next
evening
roland
felt
by
his
own
fatigue
that
the
man
he
was
following
must
need
rest
and
roland
in
order
not
to
force
his
horse
and
the
better
to
reconnoitre
the
tracks
he
was
following
had
taken
six
hours
to
do
thirty
miles
three
o
olock
was
striking
from
the
truncated
of
roland
debated
what
to
do
should
he
stop
at
some
inn
in
the
town
impossible
he
was
too
well
known
in
bourg
besides
his
horse
with
its
cavalry
would
excite
suspicion
it
was
one
of
the
conditions
of
success
that
his
presence
at
bourg
should
remain
unknown
he
could
hide
at
the
château
des
and
keep
on
the
watch
but
could
he
trust
the
servants
michel
and
jacques
would
hold
their
tongues

was
sure
of
them
but
charlotte
the
jailer
s
daughter
she
might
gossip
however
it
was
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
every
one
was
asleep
and
the
safest
plan
was
certainly
to
put
himself
in
communication
with
michel
michel
would
find
some
way
of
concealing
his
presence
to
the
deep
regret
of
his
horse
who
had
no
doubt
scented
a
stable
roland
wheeled
about
and
rode
off
in
the
direction
of
ain
as
he
passed
the
church
of
brou
he
glanced
at
the
barrack
of
the
gendarmes
where
in
all
probability
they
and
their
captain
were
sleeping
the
sleep
of
the
righteous
roland
cut
through
the
little
strip
of
forest
which
jutted
into
the
road
the
snow
deadened
the
sound
of
his
horse
s
hoofs
branching
into
the
road
from
the
other
side
he
saw
two
men
slinking
along
in
the
ditch
carrying
a
deer
slung
by
its
forelegs
to
a
sapling
he
thought
he
recognized
the
cut
of
the
two
men
and
he
spurred
his
horse
to
overtake
them
the
men
were
on
the
watch
they
turned
saw
the
rider
who
was
evidently
making
for
them
flung
the
animal
into
the
ditch
and
made
for
the
shelter
of
the
forest
of
seillon
hey
michel
cried
roland
more
and
more
convinced
that
he
had
to
do
with
his
own
gardener
michel
stopped
short
the
other
man
kept
on
his
way
across
the
fields
hey
jacques
shouted
roland
the
other
man
stopped
if
they
were
recognized
it
was
useless
to
fly
besides
there
was
nothing
hostile
in
the
call
the
voice
was
friendly
rather
than
threatening
bless
me
said
jacques
it
sounds
like
i
do
believe
it
is
he
said
michel
and
the
two
men
instead
of
continuing
their
flight
returned
to
the
highroad
roland
had
not
heard
what
the
two
poachers
had
said
but
he
had
guessed
hey
the
deuce
of
course
it
is
i
he
shouted
a
minute
more
and
michel
and
jacques
were
beside
him
the
questions
of
father
and
son
were
a
crossfire
and
it
must
be
owned
they
had
good
reason
for
amazement
roland
in
civilian
s
dress
on
a
cavalry
horse
at
three
in
the
morning
on
the
road
from
bourg
to
the
château
the
young
officer
cut
short
all
questions
silence
poachers
said
he
put
that
deer
behind
me
and
be
off
at
trot
to
the
château
no
one
must
know
of
my
presence
there
not
even
my
roland
spoke
with
military
precision
and
both
men
knew
that
when
he
gave
an
order
there
was
no
replying
they
picked
up
the
deer
put
it
behind
his
saddle
and
followed
the
gentle
trot
of
the
horse
at
a
run
there
was
less
than
a
mile
to
do
and
it
took
but
ten
minutes
at
a
short
distance
from
the
château
roland
pulled
up
the
two
men
went
forward
as
scouts
to
see
if
all
were
quiet
satisfied
on
that
point
they
made
a
sign
to
roland
to
advance
roland
came
dismounted
found
the
door
of
the
lodge
open
and
entered
michel
took
the
horse
to
the
stable
and
carried
the
deer
to
the
kitchen
for
michel
belonged
to
that
honorable
class
of
poachers
who
kill
game
for
the
pleasure
of
killing
and
not
for
the
selfish
interest
of
sale
there
was
no
need
for
precaution
either
for
horse
or
deer
for
amélie
took
no
more
notice
of
what
went
on
in
the
stable
than
of
what
they
served
her
to
eat
during
this
time
jacques
lighted
the
fire
when
michel
returned
he
brought
the
remains
of
a
leg
of
mutton
and
some
eggs
for
an
omelet
jacques
made
up
a
bed
in
the
office
roland
warmed
himself
and
ate
his
supper
without
saying
a
word
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
with
an
astonishment
that
was
not
devoid
of
a
certain
degree
of
anxiety
a
rumor
of
the
expedition
to
seillon
had
got
about
and
it
was
whispered
that
roland
had
led
it
apparently
he
had
returned
for
another
similar
expedition
when
roland
had
finished
his
supper
he
looked
up
and
saw
michel
ah
so
there
you
are
he
exclaimed
i
am
waiting
for
monsieur
s
here
they
are
listen
i
m
all
it
s
a
question
of
life
or
death
of
more
than
that
of
my
speak
monsieur
roland
pulled
out
his
watch
it
is
now
five
o
clock
when
the
inn
of
the
opens
be
there
as
if
you
were
just
sauntering
by
then
stop
a
minute
to
chat
with
whoever
opens
that
will
probably
be
pierre
or
another
find
out
from
him
who
the
traveller
is
who
arrived
last
night
on
a
pacing
horse
you
know
what
pacing
is
don
t
you
the
deuce
you
mean
a
horse
that
goes
like
a
bear
both
feet
forward
at
the
same
bravo
you
can
also
find
out
whether
the
traveller
is
leaving
this
morning
or
whether
he
proposes
to
spend
the
day
at
the
hotel
can
t
you
of
course
i
can
find
that
well
when
you
have
found
out
all
that
come
and
tell
me
but
remember
not
a
word
about
my
being
here
if
any
one
asks
about
me
say
that
they
had
a
letter
from
me
yesterday
and
that
i
was
in
paris
with
the
first
that
s
michel
departed
roland
went
to
bed
and
to
sleep
leaving
jacques
to
guard
the
building
when
roland
awoke
michel
had
returned
he
had
found
out
all
that
his
master
desired
to
know
the
horseman
who
had
arrived
in
the
night
was
to
leave
the
next
morning
and
on
the
travellers
register
which
every
innkeeper
was
obliged
by
law
to
keep
in
those
days
was
entered
saturday
pluviose
at
the
citizen
valensolle
from
lyons
going
to
thus
the
alibi
was
prepared
for
the
register
would
prove
that
the
citizen
valensolle
had
arrived
at
ten
o
clock
and
it
was
impossible
that
he
could
have
assisted
in
robbing
the
near
the
at
eight
and
yet
have
reached
the
hotel
de
la
at
ten
but
what
impressed
roland
the
most
was
that
the
man
he
had
followed
through
the
night
and
whose
name
and
retreat
he
had
just
discovered
was
none
other
than
the
second
of
alfred
de
barjols
whom
he
himself
had
killed
in
a
duel
near
the
fountain
of
vaucluse
and
that
that
second
was
in
all
probability
the
man
who
had
played
the
part
of
ghost
at
the
chartreuse
of
seillon
so
then
the
companions
of
jehu
were
not
mere
thieves
but
on
the
contrary
as
rumor
said
gentlemen
of
good
family
who
while
the
noble
bretons
were
laying
down
their
lives
for
the
royalist
cause
in
the
west
were
here
in
the
east
braving
the
scaffold
to
send
to
the
combatants
the
money
they
took
from
the
government
chapter
xlvi
an
inspiration
we
have
seen
that
during
the
pursuit
of
the
preceding
night
roland
could
have
arrested
one
or
two
of
the
men
he
was
pursuing
he
could
now
do
the
same
with
de
valensolle
who
was
probably
like
roland
himself
taking
a
day
s
rest
after
a
night
of
great
fatigue
to
do
it
he
had
only
to
write
a
line
to
the
captain
of
gendarmes
or
to
the
colonel
of
dragoons
who
had
assisted
him
during
that
ineffectual
search
at
seillon
their
honor
was
concerned
in
the
affair
they
could
instantly
surprise
de
valensolle
in
bed
and
at
the
cost
of
two
pistol
shots
two
men
killed
or
wounded
he
would
be
taken
but
de
valensolle
s
arrest
would
give
warning
to
the
rest
of
the
band
who
would
instantly
put
themselves
in
safety
beyond
the
frontier
it
was
better
therefore
to
keep
to
his
first
idea
to
go
slowly
to
follow
the
different
trails
which
must
converge
to
one
centre
and
at
the
risk
of
a
general
engagement
throw
a
net
over
the
whole
company
to
do
that
de
valensolle
must
not
be
arrested
it
was
better
to
follow
him
on
his
pretended
journey
to
geneva
which
was
probably
but
a
blind
to
foil
investigation
it
was
therefore
agreed
that
roland
whose
disguise
however
good
was
liable
to
be
penetrated
should
remain
at
the
lodge
and
michel
and
jacques
should
head
off
the
game
in
all
probabilities
de
valensolle
would
not
set
out
from
the
inn
before
nightfall
roland
made
inquiries
of
michel
about
the
life
his
sister
had
led
since
her
mother
s
departure
he
learned
that
she
had
never
once
left
the
grounds
during
that
time
her
habits
were
still
the
same
except
for
the
walks
and
visits
she
had
made
with
madame
de
montrevel
she
rose
at
seven
or
eight
in
the
morning
sketched
or
practiced
her
music
till
breakfast
and
afterward
read
or
employed
herself
at
some
kind
of
embroidery
or
took
advantage
of
the
sunshine
to
go
out
with
charlotte
to
the
river
sometimes
she
bade
michel
unfasten
the
little
boat
and
then
well
wrapped
in
furs
would
row
up
the
reissouse
as
far
as
montagnac
or
down
to
during
these
trips
she
spoke
to
no
one
then
she
dined
after
dinner
she
retired
to
her
bedroom
and
did
not
appear
again
by
six
therefore
michel
and
jacques
could
decamp
without
arousing
any
suspicion
as
to
their
and
accordingly
at
that
hour
they
took
their
blouses
and
guns
and
started
roland
had
given
them
their
instructions
they
were
to
follow
the
pacing
horse
until
they
had
ascertained
his
destination
or
until
they
had
lost
all
trace
of
him
michel
was
to
lie
in
wait
opposite
the
inn
of
the
jacques
was
to
station
himself
outside
of
bourg
just
where
the
main
road
divides
into
three
branches
one
going
to
another
to
and
the
third
to
nantua
this
last
was
at
the
same
time
the
highroad
to
geneva
it
was
evident
that
unless
de
valensolle
returned
upon
his
steps
which
was
not
probable
he
would
take
one
or
another
of
these
three
roads
the
father
started
in
one
direction
the
son
in
another
michel
went
toward
the
town
by
the
road
to
ain
passing
the
church
of
brou
jacques
crossed
the
reissouse
followed
the
right
bank
of
the
little
river
and
found
himself
after
walking
a
few
hundred
yards
beyond
the
town
at
the
sharp
angle
made
by
the
parting
of
the
three
roads
father
and
son
reached
their
separate
posts
at
about
the
same
time
at
this
particular
moment
that
is
to
say
about
seven
o
clock
the
stillness
and
solitude
surrounding
the
château
des
was
broken
by
the
arrival
of
a
which
stopped
before
the
iron
gate
a
servant
in
livery
got
off
the
box
and
pulled
the
chain
of
the
bell
it
was
michel
s
business
to
open
the
gate
but
michel
was
away
as
we
know
amélie
and
charlotte
probably
counted
on
him
for
the
bell
was
rung
three
times
before
any
one
answered
it
at
last
the
maid
appeared
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
calling
michel
michel
made
no
reply
finally
protected
by
the
locked
gates
charlotte
ventured
to
approach
them
in
spite
of
the
obscurity
she
recognized
the
servant
ah
is
it
you
monsieur
james
she
cried
somewhat
reassured
james
was
sir
john
s
confidential
valet
yes
mademoiselle
it
is
i
or
rather
it
is
sir
the
carriage
door
opened
at
this
moment
and
his
master
s
voice
was
heard
saying
mademoiselle
charlotte
will
you
tell
your
mistress
that
i
have
just
arrived
from
paris
that
i
have
called
to
leave
my
card
and
to
ask
permission
not
to
be
received
this
evening
but
to
be
allowed
to
call
if
she
will
grant
me
that
favor
ask
her
at
what
hour
i
shall
least
inconvenience
mademoiselle
charlotte
had
a
high
opinion
of
sir
john
consequently
she
acquitted
herself
of
the
commission
with
the
utmost
alacrity
five
minutes
later
she
returned
to
announce
that
sir
john
would
be
received
the
next
day
between
twelve
and
one
o
clock
roland
knew
what
the
englishman
had
come
for
in
his
mind
the
marriage
was
an
accomplished
fact
and
he
regarded
sir
john
already
as
his
he
hesitated
a
moment
as
to
whether
he
should
or
should
not
make
himself
known
to
sir
john
and
tell
his
friend
about
his
projects
but
he
reflected
that
sir
john
was
not
a
man
to
let
him
work
them
out
alone
he
too
had
a
revenge
to
take
on
the
companions
of
jehu
he
would
certainly
insist
on
taking
part
in
the
expedition
whatever
it
was
and
that
expedition
however
it
might
result
was
certain
to
be
dangerous
and
another
disaster
might
befall
him
roland
s
luck
as
roland
well
knew
did
not
extend
to
his
friends
sir
john
grievously
wounded
had
barely
escaped
with
his
life
and
the
colonel
of
dragoons
had
been
killed
outright
he
therefore
allowed
sir
john
to
drive
away
without
giving
any
sign
of
his
own
proximity
as
for
charlotte
she
did
not
seem
in
the
least
surprised
that
michel
was
not
there
to
open
the
gate
evidently
they
were
accustomed
to
his
absences
and
they
did
not
disturb
either
the
mistress
or
the
maid
for
the
rest
roland
knew
his
sister
well
enough
to
understand
this
indifference
amélie
feeble
under
a
moral
suffering
wholly
unsuspected
by
roland
who
attributed
to
simple
nervous
crises
the
fluctuations
of
his
sister
s
character
amélie
was
strong
and
brave
before
real
danger
that
was
no
doubt
why
she
felt
no
fear
about
remaining
with
charlotte
alone
in
the
lonely
house
without
other
protection
than
that
afforded
by
the
two
gardeners
who
spent
their
nights
in
poaching
as
for
ourselves
we
know
that
michel
and
his
son
did
really
serve
their
mistress
desire
more
in
absenting
themselves
thus
frequently
from
the
château
than
in
staying
near
it
their
absence
left
the
coast
clear
for
morgan
and
that
was
all
amélie
really
cared
about
that
evening
and
part
of
the
night
went
by
without
bringing
roland
any
news
he
tried
to
sleep
but
succeeded
ill
he
fancied
every
minute
that
he
heard
some
one
at
the
door
the
day
was
just
beginning
to
glimmer
through
the
shutters
when
the
door
did
actually
open
michel
and
jacques
were
returning
and
this
is
what
had
happened
to
them
they
had
each
gone
to
his
post
michel
at
the
inn
door
jacques
to
the
junction
of
the
roads
twenty
paces
from
the
door
michel
had
met
pierre
and
three
words
sufficed
to
show
him
that
de
valensolle
was
still
at
the
inn
the
latter
had
announced
that
as
he
had
a
long
journey
before
him
he
would
let
his
horse
rest
and
would
not
start
until
nightfall
pierre
did
not
doubt
that
he
was
going
to
geneva
as
he
said
michel
proposed
a
glass
of
wine
to
pierre
pierre
accepted
after
that
michel
was
sure
of
being
warned
of
any
change
pierre
was
the
hostler
and
nothing
could
be
done
in
the
stable
without
his
knowledge
a
lad
attached
to
the
inn
promised
to
convey
the
news
to
michel
in
return
for
which
michel
gave
him
three
charges
of
powder
with
which
to
make
firecrackers
at
midnight
the
traveller
had
not
yet
started
they
had
drunk
four
bottles
of
wine
but
michel
had
partaken
sparingly
of
them
he
had
found
means
to
pour
three
of
the
four
bottles
into
pierre
s
glass
where
they
did
not
long
remain
at
midnight
the
closed
and
michel
having
nowhere
to
go
for
the
four
hours
that
still
remained
until
daybreak
pierre
offered
him
a
bed
of
straw
in
the
stable
michel
accepted
the
two
friends
went
back
pierre
staggering
michel
pretending
to
stagger
at
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
servant
of
the
hotel
awakened
michel
the
traveller
wanted
his
horse
michel
pretending
that
he
must
be
off
to
see
to
his
game
also
rose
his
toilet
was
not
long
in
making
he
had
only
to
shake
the
straw
from
his
hair
and
blouse
after
which
he
took
leave
of
his
friend
pierre
and
hid
himself
at
the
corner
of
the
street
fifteen
minutes
later
the
gate
opened
and
a
man
rode
out
on
a
pacing
horse
it
was
de
valensolle
he
took
the
street
that
led
to
the
geneva
road
michel
followed
without
concealment
whistling
a
hunting
air
only
as
michel
could
not
run
for
fear
of
attracting
the
rider
s
notice
he
lost
sight
of
him
before
long
but
jacques
was
there
thought
he
waiting
at
the
fork
of
the
roads
yes
jacques
had
been
there
but
he
had
been
there
for
over
six
hours
of
a
winter
s
night
in
five
degrees
of
cold
had
he
the
courage
to
stand
six
hours
in
the
snow
and
kick
his
soles
against
a
tree
thinking
thus
michel
took
a
short
cut
through
the
streets
and
lanes
running
at
full
speed
but
horse
and
rider
in
spite
of
his
haste
had
gone
faster
than
he
he
reached
the
fork
of
the
roads
all
was
silent
and
solitary
the
snow
trampled
the
day
before
a
sunday
no
longer
showed
distinct
tracks
the
steps
of
the
horse
were
lost
in
the
mud
of
the
road
nor
did
he
waste
further
time
in
vain
searching
he
wondered
what
had
become
of
jacques
but
his
poacher
s
eye
soon
told
him
jacques
had
stood
on
watch
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
for
how
long
it
was
difficult
to
say
but
long
enough
to
become
very
cold
the
snow
was
well
beaten
down
by
his
heavy
he
had
evidently
tried
to
keep
warm
by
walking
up
and
down
then
suddenly
he
must
have
remembered
a
little
mud
hut
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
such
as
the
build
as
a
shelter
against
the
rain
he
had
gone
down
the
ditch
and
crossed
the
road
his
trail
lost
for
a
moment
in
the
centre
of
the
road
was
visible
on
the
snow
at
either
side
this
trail
formed
a
diagonal
line
making
straight
for
the
hut
it
was
evidently
in
the
hut
that
jacques
had
passed
the
night
but
when
had
he
left
it
and
why
had
he
left
it
the
first
question
was
unanswerable
but
to
the
most
inexperienced
scout
the
second
was
plain
enough
he
had
left
it
to
follow
de
valensolle
the
same
footsteps
that
had
approached
the
hut
were
to
be
seen
going
as
they
left
it
in
the
direction
of
ceyzeriat
the
traveller
had
really
taken
the
road
to
geneva
jacques
footsteps
showed
it
plainly
the
stride
was
long
like
that
of
a
man
running
and
he
had
followed
the
road
behind
the
trees
evidently
to
conceal
himself
from
the
rider
at
a
wretched
tavern
one
of
those
with
the
legend
inscribed
over
its
door
here
we
give
food
and
drink
equestrian
and
pedestrian
lodgings
the
trail
stopped
it
was
clear
that
the
rider
had
stopped
before
this
inn
for
jacques
had
also
paused
behind
a
tree
some
twenty
feet
distant
where
the
snow
then
probably
after
the
gate
had
closed
on
horse
and
rider
jacques
had
left
his
tree
crossed
the
road
this
time
with
hesitation
his
short
steps
leading
not
to
the
door
but
to
the
window
michel
put
his
own
feet
in
his
son
s
footprints
and
reached
the
window
through
the
chinks
in
the
shutter
the
interior
when
lighted
could
be
seen
but
now
all
was
dark
and
michel
could
see
nothing
but
jacques
had
certainly
looked
through
the
window
no
doubt
it
was
then
lighted
and
he
had
been
able
to
see
something
where
had
he
gone
on
leaving
the
window
round
the
house
close
to
the
wall
this
excursion
was
easy
to
follow
the
snow
was
virgin
as
for
his
purpose
in
going
round
the
house
that
was
not
difficult
to
make
out
jacques
like
a
lad
of
sense
had
concluded
that
the
traveller
had
not
left
a
good
hotel
saying
that
he
was
going
to
geneva
to
put
up
at
a
miserable
tavern
a
mile
from
the
town
he
must
have
ridden
through
the
yard
and
gone
out
by
some
other
exit
jacques
had
therefore
skirted
the
house
in
the
hope
of
recovering
the
trail
if
not
of
the
horse
at
least
of
the
rider
on
the
other
side
sure
enough
from
a
small
gate
in
the
rear
opening
toward
the
forest
that
extends
from
coterz
to
ceyzeriat
footsteps
could
be
seen
advancing
in
a
straight
line
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
they
were
those
of
a
man
elegantly
shod
wearing
spurs
on
his
heels
for
the
spurs
had
left
their
marks
upon
the
snow
jacques
had
not
hesitated
to
follow
these
marks
the
track
of
his
heavy
shoes
could
be
seen
near
the
prints
of
the
delicate
boot
the
large
foot
of
the
peasant
near
the
slender
foot
of
the
city
man
it
was
now
five
o
clock
day
was
breaking
and
michel
resolved
to
go
no
further
jacques
was
on
the
trail
and
the
young
poacher
was
worth
as
much
as
the
old
one
michel
circled
the
open
as
if
he
were
returning
from
ceyzeriat
resolving
to
enter
the
inn
and
wait
for
jacques
return
certain
that
his
son
would
know
he
had
followed
him
and
had
stopped
short
at
this
isolated
house
michel
knocked
on
the
and
was
soon
admitted
he
knew
the
landlord
who
was
well
accustomed
to
his
nocturnal
habits
asked
for
a
bottle
complaining
bitterly
of
his
poor
luck
and
asked
permission
to
wait
for
his
son
who
was
in
the
woods
on
the
other
side
and
who
he
hoped
had
been
more
successful
in
tracking
the
game
it
goes
without
saying
that
this
permission
was
readily
accorded
michel
opened
the
in
order
to
look
out
on
the
road
it
was
not
long
before
some
one
knocked
on
the
glass
it
was
jacques
his
father
called
him
jacques
had
been
as
unfortunate
as
his
father
no
game
and
he
was
frozen
an
armful
of
wood
was
thrown
on
the
fire
and
a
second
bottle
of
wine
was
brought
jacques
warmed
himself
and
drank
then
as
it
was
necessary
that
the
two
poachers
should
be
back
at
the
château
before
daylight
that
their
absence
might
not
be
noticed
michel
paid
for
the
wine
and
the
wood
and
the
pair
departed
neither
had
said
one
word
before
the
landlord
of
the
subject
that
filled
their
minds
he
was
not
to
suspect
that
they
were
on
other
trail
than
that
of
game
but
no
sooner
were
they
outside
of
the
house
than
michel
drew
close
to
his
son
jacques
recounted
how
he
had
followed
the
tracks
until
they
had
reached
a
crossroad
in
the
forest
there
a
man
armed
with
a
gun
had
suddenly
appeared
and
asked
him
what
he
was
doing
in
the
forest
at
that
hour
jacques
replied
that
he
was
watching
for
game
then
go
further
said
the
man
don
t
you
see
that
this
place
is
taken
jacques
admitted
the
justice
of
this
claim
and
went
on
about
a
hundred
rods
further
but
just
as
he
was
slanting
to
the
left
to
return
to
the
crossroad
another
man
armed
like
the
first
had
suddenly
started
up
with
the
same
inopportune
question
jacques
gave
him
the
same
answer
watching
for
the
man
had
then
pointed
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
saying
in
a
threatening
manner
if
i
have
any
advice
to
give
you
my
young
friend
it
is
to
go
over
there
it
will
be
safer
for
you
than
jacques
had
taken
this
advice
or
at
least
had
pretended
to
take
it
for
as
soon
as
he
had
reached
the
edge
of
the
woods
he
had
crept
along
in
the
ditch
until
convinced
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
recover
de
valensolle
s
track
he
had
struck
into
the
open
and
returned
by
fields
and
the
highroad
to
the
tavern
where
he
hoped
to
and
in
fact
did
find
his
father
they
reached
the
château
des
as
we
have
seen
just
as
day
was
breaking
all
that
we
have
related
was
repeated
to
roland
with
a
multiplicity
of
detail
which
we
must
omit
and
convinced
the
young
officer
that
the
two
armed
men
who
had
warned
off
jacques
were
not
poachers
as
they
seemed
but
companions
of
jehu
but
where
was
their
haunt
located
there
was
no
deserted
convent
no
ruin
in
that
direction
suddenly
roland
clapped
his
hand
to
his
head
idiot
that
i
am
he
cried
why
did
i
never
think
of
that
a
smile
of
triumph
crossed
his
lips
and
addressing
the
two
men
who
were
mortified
at
having
brought
him
no
more
definite
news
he
cried
my
lads
i
know
all
i
want
to
know
go
to
bed
and
sleep
sound
my
word
you
deserve
to
he
himself
setting
the
example
slept
like
a
man
whose
brain
has
solved
a
problem
of
the
utmost
importance
which
has
long
harassed
it
the
thought
had
just
flashed
through
his
mind
that
the
companions
of
jehu
had
abandoned
the
chartreuse
of
seillon
for
the
grottoes
of
ceyzeriat
and
at
the
same
time
he
recalled
the
subterranean
passage
leading
from
these
grottoes
to
the
church
of
brou
chapter
xlvii
a
reconnoissance
that
same
day
sir
john
making
use
of
the
permission
accorded
him
the
night
before
presented
himself
at
the
château
des
between
twelve
and
one
o
clock
everything
occurred
as
morgan
had
advised
sir
john
was
received
as
the
friend
of
the
family
lord
tanlay
as
a
suitor
whose
attentions
were
most
flattering
amélie
made
no
opposition
to
the
wishes
of
her
mother
and
brother
and
to
the
commands
of
the
first
consul
further
than
to
dwell
on
the
state
of
her
health
and
to
ask
for
delay
on
that
account
sir
john
bowed
and
submitted
he
had
obtained
more
than
he
had
hoped
to
obtain
he
was
accepted
he
felt
that
his
presence
in
bourg
if
prolonged
would
be
an
impropriety
amélie
being
still
on
the
plea
of
parted
from
her
mother
and
brother
he
therefore
announced
that
he
would
pay
her
a
second
visit
on
the
morrow
and
leave
bourg
that
same
evening
he
would
delay
further
visits
until
amélie
came
to
paris
or
until
madame
de
montrevel
returned
to
bourg
the
latter
arrangement
was
the
more
probable
of
the
two
for
amélie
assured
him
she
needed
the
country
air
and
the
weather
to
assist
her
in
recovering
her
health
thanks
to
sir
john
s
considerate
delicacy
the
plan
arranged
between
amélie
and
morgan
was
thus
carried
out
and
the
two
lovers
had
before
them
a
period
of
solitude
and
a
respite
in
which
to
form
their
plans
michel
learned
these
details
from
charlotte
and
imparted
them
in
turn
to
roland
the
latter
determined
to
await
sir
john
s
departure
before
he
took
any
decisive
steps
against
the
companions
of
jehu
but
this
did
not
prevent
him
from
endeavoring
to
set
at
rest
any
remaining
doubts
when
night
came
he
put
on
a
and
over
it
michel
s
blouse
concealed
his
face
beneath
a
hat
slipped
a
pair
of
pistols
in
his
hidden
by
the
blouse
and
boldly
took
the
road
from
to
bourg
he
stopped
at
the
barracks
of
the
gendarmerie
and
asked
to
see
the
captain
the
captain
was
in
his
room
roland
went
up
and
made
himself
known
then
as
it
was
only
eight
o
clock
and
some
one
passing
might
recognize
him
he
blew
out
the
light
and
the
two
men
talked
in
the
dark
the
captain
knew
already
what
had
happened
on
the
lyons
road
three
days
earlier
and
certain
that
roland
was
not
killed
was
expecting
him
to
his
great
astonishment
roland
asked
him
for
only
one
or
rather
for
two
things
the
key
of
the
church
of
brou
and
a
crowbar
the
captain
gave
him
the
required
articles
and
offered
to
accompany
him
but
roland
refused
it
was
evident
to
his
mind
that
he
had
been
betrayed
by
some
one
connected
with
the
affair
of
the
and
he
would
not
expose
himself
to
a
second
defeat
he
therefore
begged
the
captain
to
tell
no
one
of
his
presence
in
bourg
and
to
await
his
return
even
if
it
were
delayed
some
hours
the
captain
agreed
roland
the
key
in
his
right
hand
the
crowbar
in
his
left
reached
the
side
door
of
the
church
without
making
any
noise
this
he
unlocked
entered
relocked
it
behind
him
and
found
himself
facing
a
wall
of
hay
he
listened
the
most
profound
silence
reigned
he
remembered
his
boyish
habits
took
his
bearings
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
and
scrambled
up
the
wall
of
hay
which
was
about
fifteen
feet
high
and
formed
a
sort
of
platform
when
he
reached
the
top
he
slid
down
on
the
other
side
as
though
he
were
descending
the
scarp
of
a
fortification
and
reached
the
flooring
of
the
church
which
was
almost
wholly
composed
of
mortuary
stones
the
choir
was
empty
thanks
to
a
which
protected
it
on
one
side
and
also
to
the
walls
which
inclosed
it
to
right
and
left
the
door
of
the
screen
was
open
and
roland
entered
the
choir
without
difficulty
he
came
face
to
face
with
the
monument
of
philippe
le
beau
at
the
head
of
the
tomb
was
a
large
square
flagstone
it
covered
the
steps
which
led
to
the
burial
vaults
roland
must
have
known
the
way
for
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
stone
he
knelt
down
and
felt
with
his
hand
for
the
edge
of
it
when
he
found
it
he
stood
up
inserted
his
lever
and
raised
the
slab
with
one
hand
he
held
it
up
while
he
went
down
the
steps
then
he
lowered
it
slowly
it
seemed
as
though
this
nocturnal
visitor
were
voluntarily
separating
himself
from
the
land
of
the
living
and
descending
into
the
world
of
the
dead
and
strange
indeed
to
him
who
sees
by
night
as
by
day
on
the
earth
and
beneath
it
must
the
impassibility
of
this
young
man
have
seemed
who
passed
among
the
dead
in
search
of
the
living
and
who
in
spite
of
darkness
and
solitude
did
not
shudder
at
the
touch
of
the
mortuary
marbles
he
walked
on
feeling
his
way
among
the
tombs
until
he
came
to
the
iron
gate
leading
to
the
subterranean
passage
he
looked
for
the
lock
it
was
only
bolted
he
inserted
the
end
of
his
lever
between
the
bolt
and
the
staple
and
pushed
it
gently
the
gate
opened
he
drew
it
close
after
him
but
did
not
lock
it
so
as
to
avoid
delay
on
his
return
the
crowbar
he
left
at
the
corner
of
the
gate
then
with
straining
ears
dilated
pupils
every
sense
tense
with
this
effort
to
hear
the
need
to
breathe
the
impossibility
of
seeing
he
advanced
slowly
a
pistol
in
one
hand
touching
the
wall
with
the
other
to
guide
himself
he
walked
thus
for
fifteen
minutes
a
few
drops
of
water
fell
through
the
roof
on
his
hands
and
shoulders
and
told
him
he
was
passing
under
the
river
at
the
end
of
this
time
he
found
the
door
which
opened
from
the
passage
into
the
quarry
there
he
halted
a
moment
he
could
now
breathe
more
freely
and
moreover
he
fancied
that
he
heard
distant
sounds
and
could
see
flickering
lights
like
on
the
pillars
that
supported
the
roof
an
observer
might
have
thought
not
distinguishing
the
face
of
the
silent
listener
that
he
showed
hesitation
but
the
moment
his
countenance
was
seen
no
one
could
have
mistaken
its
expression
of
hope
he
then
resumed
his
way
heading
toward
the
light
he
thought
he
had
seen
as
he
advanced
the
lights
and
the
noises
grew
more
distinct
it
was
evident
that
the
quarry
was
inhabited
by
whom
he
did
not
yet
know
but
he
would
know
he
was
already
within
ten
feet
of
that
open
clearing
in
the
midst
of
the
granite
walls
which
we
described
on
our
first
visit
to
the
grotto
of
ceyzeriat
roland
clung
closely
to
the
wall
and
moved
forward
almost
imperceptibly
in
the
dim
he
looked
like
a
gliding
at
last
his
head
passed
beyond
an
angle
of
the
wall
and
his
glance
rested
upon
what
we
may
call
the
camp
of
the
companions
of
jehu
a
dozen
or
more
of
the
members
sat
there
at
supper
roland
was
seized
with
a
wild
desire
to
precipitate
himself
into
their
midst
attacking
them
singly
and
fighting
until
he
died
but
he
repressed
the
insensate
thought
withdrew
his
head
as
slowly
as
he
had
advanced
it
and
with
beaming
eyes
and
heart
full
of
joy
returned
unseen
and
unsuspected
along
the
way
he
had
come
everything
was
now
explained
the
deserted
chartreuse
de
valensolle
s
disappearance
and
the
counterfeit
poachers
near
the
entrance
to
the
grotto
of
ceyzeriat
this
time
he
was
sure
of
his
vengeance
his
deadly
terrible
vengeance
deadly
because
in
like
manner
as
he
had
been
spared
he
suspected
intentionally
he
meant
to
spare
others
with
this
difference
that
whereas
he
had
been
spared
for
life
he
would
order
these
men
spared
for
death
death
on
the
scaffold
back
he
thought
he
heard
a
noise
behind
him
he
turned
and
was
certain
he
saw
a
gleam
of
light
he
quickened
his
steps
the
gate
once
passed
there
was
no
danger
of
losing
his
way
it
was
no
longer
a
quarry
with
a
thousand
windings
it
was
a
straight
and
narrow
vaulted
passage
leading
to
the
mortuary
grating
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
he
again
passed
under
the
river
a
couple
of
minutes
later
his
outstretched
hand
touched
the
iron
gate
he
took
the
crowbar
from
the
place
where
he
had
left
it
entered
the
vault
pulled
the
gate
to
closed
it
gently
and
noiselessly
and
guiding
himself
by
the
tombs
he
regained
the
staircase
pushed
up
the
flagstone
with
his
head
and
stood
once
more
in
the
land
of
the
living
there
it
was
comparative
daylight
he
left
the
choir
closed
the
door
of
the
screen
as
he
had
found
it
scaled
the
hay
crossed
the
platform
and
slid
down
the
other
side
the
key
was
still
in
his
pocket
he
unlocked
the
door
and
stepped
out
into
the
street
the
captain
of
gendarmerie
was
anxiously
awaiting
him
they
conferred
together
for
a
few
moments
and
then
they
returned
to
bourg
by
the
outer
road
to
avoid
being
seen
here
they
entered
the
town
through
the
and
followed
the
rue
de
la
révolution
the
rue
de
la
liberté
and
the
rue
d
espagne
since
called
the
rue
simonneau
there
roland
ensconced
himself
in
a
corner
of
the
rue
du
greffe
and
waited
the
captain
continued
on
his
way
alone
he
went
down
the
rue
des
ursules
for
the
last
seven
years
called
the
rue
des
casernes
this
was
where
the
colonel
of
dragoons
lived
he
had
just
gone
to
bed
when
the
captain
of
the
gendarmerie
entered
his
room
in
two
words
the
latter
told
all
and
he
rose
at
once
and
dressed
in
haste
when
the
colonel
of
dragoons
and
the
captain
of
gendarmerie
appeared
in
the
square
a
shadow
detached
itself
from
the
opposite
wall
and
came
up
to
them
that
shadow
was
roland
the
three
men
stood
talking
for
about
ten
minutes
roland
giving
his
orders
the
other
two
listening
and
approving
then
they
separated
the
colonel
returned
home
roland
and
the
captain
followed
the
rue
de
l
etoile
climbed
the
steps
of
the
jacobins
passed
down
the
rue
du
bourgneuf
and
reached
the
outer
road
once
more
then
they
struck
diagonally
across
to
the
highroad
of
ain
the
captain
stopped
at
the
barracks
which
were
on
the
way
and
roland
continued
alone
to
the
château
twenty
minutes
later
in
order
not
to
awaken
amélie
instead
of
ringing
the
bell
he
knocked
on
michel
s
michel
opened
and
with
one
bound
roland
devoured
by
that
fever
which
took
possession
of
him
whenever
he
incurred
or
merely
dreamed
of
some
danger
sprang
into
the
room
he
would
not
have
awakened
amélie
had
he
rung
for
amélie
was
not
asleep
charlotte
had
been
into
town
ostensibly
to
see
her
father
but
really
to
take
a
letter
from
her
mistress
to
morgan
she
had
seen
morgan
and
brought
back
his
answer
amélie
was
reading
that
answer
which
was
as
follows
dear
love
of
mine
yes
all
goes
well
on
your
side
for
you
are
an
angel
but
i
greatly
fear
that
all
may
go
ill
on
mine
for
i
am
the
demon
i
must
see
you
i
must
hold
you
in
my
arms
and
press
you
to
my
heart
i
know
not
what
presentiment
hangs
over
me
but
i
am
sad
sad
as
death
send
charlotte
to
make
sure
that
sir
john
is
gone
and
then
if
you
are
certain
make
the
accustomed
signal
do
not
be
alarmed
do
not
talk
to
me
of
the
snow
or
tell
me
that
my
footsteps
will
be
seen
this
time
it
is
not
i
who
will
go
to
you
but
you
who
must
come
to
me
do
you
understand
you
can
safely
walk
in
the
park
and
no
one
will
notice
your
footsteps
put
on
your
warmest
shawl
and
your
thickest
furs
then
we
will
spend
an
hour
in
the
boat
under
the
willows
together
and
change
our
roles
for
once
usually
i
tell
you
of
my
hopes
and
you
tell
me
of
your
fears
but
you
will
tell
me
of
your
hopes
and
i
will
tell
you
of
my
fears
my
darling
amélie
only
be
sure
to
come
out
as
soon
as
you
have
made
the
signal
i
will
await
it
at
montagnac
and
from
montagnac
to
the
reissouse
it
will
not
take
a
love
like
mine
five
minutes
to
reach
you
au
revoir
my
poor
amélie
had
you
never
met
me
you
would
have
been
the
happiest
of
the
happy
fatality
placed
me
in
your
path
and
i
have
made
a
martyr
of
you
your
charles
without
fail
unless
some
insurmountable
obstacle
prevents
chapter
xlviii
in
which
morgan
s
presentiments
are
verified
it
often
happens
that
the
skies
are
never
so
calm
or
so
serene
as
before
a
storm
the
day
was
beautiful
and
still
one
of
those
glorious
days
of
february
when
in
spite
of
the
tingling
cold
of
the
atmosphere
in
spite
of
a
of
snow
covering
the
earth
the
sun
smiles
down
upon
mankind
with
a
promise
of
spring
sir
john
came
at
noon
to
make
his
farewell
visit
to
amélie
he
had
or
thought
he
had
her
promise
and
that
satisfied
him
his
impatience
was
altogether
personal
but
amélie
in
accepting
his
suit
even
though
she
relegated
the
period
of
her
marriage
to
the
vaguest
possible
future
had
crowned
his
hopes
he
trusted
to
the
first
consul
and
to
roland
s
friendship
for
the
rest
he
therefore
returned
to
paris
to
do
much
of
his
courting
with
madame
de
montrevel
not
being
able
to
remain
at
bourg
and
carry
it
on
with
amélie
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
he
had
left
the
château
des
charlotte
was
also
on
her
way
to
bourg
at
four
o
clock
she
returned
bringing
word
that
she
had
seen
sir
john
with
her
own
eyes
getting
into
his
travelling
carriage
and
that
he
had
taken
the
road
to
mâcon
amélie
could
therefore
feel
perfectly
at
ease
on
that
score
she
breathed
freer
she
had
tried
to
inspire
morgan
with
a
peace
of
mind
which
she
herself
did
not
share
since
the
day
that
charlotte
had
brought
back
the
news
of
roland
s
presence
at
bourg
she
had
had
a
presentiment
like
that
of
morgan
himself
that
they
were
approaching
some
terrible
crisis
she
knew
all
that
had
happened
at
the
chartreuse
of
seillon
she
foresaw
the
struggle
between
her
brother
and
her
lover
and
with
her
mind
at
rest
about
her
brother
thanks
to
morgan
s
protection
she
knowing
roland
s
character
trembled
for
her
lover
s
life
moreover
she
had
heard
of
the
stoppage
of
the
chambéry
and
the
death
of
the
colonel
of
chasseurs
she
also
knew
that
her
brother
had
escaped
but
that
he
had
disappeared
since
that
time
she
had
received
no
letter
from
him
herself
this
disappearance
and
silence
to
her
who
knew
her
brother
so
well
was
even
worse
than
open
and
declared
war
as
for
morgan
she
had
not
seen
him
since
the
scene
we
have
narrated
when
she
promised
to
send
him
arms
wherever
he
might
be
in
case
he
were
condemned
to
death
amélie
therefore
awaited
this
interview
for
which
morgan
had
asked
with
as
much
impatience
as
he
who
had
asked
it
as
soon
as
she
thought
michel
and
his
son
were
in
bed
she
lighted
the
four
windows
with
the
candles
which
were
to
summon
morgan
to
her
then
following
her
lover
s
injunctions
she
wrapped
herself
in
a
cashmere
shawl
which
roland
had
brought
her
from
the
battlefield
of
the
pyramids
and
which
he
had
unwound
from
the
head
of
a
chieftain
whom
he
had
killed
over
this
she
flung
a
fur
mantle
left
charlotte
behind
to
keep
her
informed
in
case
of
eventualities
which
she
trusted
would
not
be
forthcoming
opened
the
park
gate
and
hastened
toward
the
river
during
the
day
she
had
gone
to
the
reissouse
and
back
several
times
to
trace
a
line
of
footsteps
among
which
the
nocturnal
ones
would
not
be
noticed
she
now
descended
if
not
tranquilly
at
least
boldly
the
slope
leading
to
the
river
once
there
she
looked
about
her
for
the
boat
beneath
the
willows
a
man
was
waiting
in
it
morgan
with
two
strokes
of
the
oar
he
reached
a
spot
where
amélie
could
come
to
him
the
young
girl
sprang
down
and
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
the
first
thing
the
young
girl
noticed
was
the
joyous
radiance
which
illuminated
if
we
may
say
so
the
face
of
her
lover
oh
she
cried
you
have
something
nice
to
tell
what
makes
you
think
so
dearest
asked
morgan
with
his
tenderest
smile
there
is
something
in
your
face
my
darling
charles
something
more
than
the
mere
happiness
of
seeing
you
are
right
said
morgan
throwing
the
around
a
willow
and
letting
the
oars
float
idly
beside
the
boat
then
taking
amélie
in
his
arms
he
said
you
were
right
my
amélie
oh
blind
weak
beings
it
is
at
the
very
moment
that
happiness
knocks
at
our
door
that
we
despair
and
oh
speak
speak
said
amélie
tell
me
what
has
do
you
remember
my
amélie
how
you
answered
me
the
last
time
we
met
when
i
asked
you
to
fly
and
spoke
to
you
of
your
probable
repugnance
to
the
step
yes
i
remember
charles
i
said
that
i
was
yours
and
that
though
i
felt
that
repugnance
i
would
conquer
it
for
your
and
i
replied
that
i
had
engagements
which
would
prevent
my
leaving
the
country
that
i
was
bound
to
others
and
they
to
me
that
our
duty
was
to
one
man
to
whom
we
owed
absolute
obedience
the
future
king
of
france
louis
yes
you
told
me
well
we
are
now
released
from
our
pledges
amélie
not
only
by
the
king
but
by
our
general
georges
oh
my
friend
then
you
will
be
as
other
men
only
above
all
i
shall
become
a
simple
exile
amélie
there
is
no
hope
of
our
being
included
in
the
breton
or
vendéan
why
not
we
are
not
soldiers
my
darling
child
we
are
not
even
rebels
we
are
companions
of
amélie
sighed
we
are
bandits
brigands
highwaymen
said
morgan
dwelling
on
the
words
with
evident
intention
hush
said
amélie
laying
her
hand
on
her
lover
s
lips
hush
don
t
let
us
speak
of
that
tell
me
how
it
is
that
your
king
has
released
you
and
your
general
the
first
consul
wished
to
see
cadoudal
in
the
first
place
he
sent
your
brother
to
him
with
certain
proposals
cadoudal
refused
to
come
to
terms
but
like
ourselves
he
received
orders
from
louis
xviii
to
cease
hostilities
coincident
with
that
order
came
another
message
from
the
first
consul
to
cadoudal
it
was
a
safeguard
for
the
vendéan
general
and
an
invitation
to
come
to
paris
an
overture
from
one
power
to
another
power
cadoudal
accepted
and
is
now
on
his
way
to
paris
if
it
is
not
peace
it
is
at
least
a
oh
what
joy
my
charles
don
t
rejoice
too
much
my
why
not
do
you
know
why
they
have
issued
this
order
to
suspend
hostilities
because
fouché
is
a
man
he
realized
that
since
he
could
not
defeat
us
he
must
dishonor
us
he
has
organized
false
companies
of
jehu
which
he
has
set
loose
in
maine
and
anjou
who
don
t
stop
at
the
government
money
but
pillage
and
rob
travellers
and
invade
the
châteaux
and
farms
by
night
and
roast
the
feet
of
the
owners
to
make
them
tell
where
their
treasure
is
hidden
well
these
men
these
bandits
these
have
taken
our
name
and
claim
to
be
fighting
for
the
same
principles
so
that
fouché
and
his
police
declare
that
we
are
not
only
beyond
the
pale
of
the
law
but
beyond
that
of
oh
that
is
what
i
wished
to
tell
you
before
i
ask
you
to
fly
with
me
my
amélie
in
the
eyes
of
france
in
the
eyes
of
foreigners
even
in
the
eyes
of
the
prince
we
have
served
and
for
whom
we
have
risked
the
scaffold
we
shall
be
hereafter
and
probably
are
now
dishonored
men
worthy
of
the
yes
but
to
me
you
are
my
charles
the
man
of
devoted
convictions
the
firm
royalist
continuing
to
struggle
for
a
cause
when
other
men
have
abandoned
it
to
me
you
are
the
loyal
baron
de
or
if
you
like
it
better
you
are
to
me
the
noble
courageous
invincible
ah
that
is
what
i
longed
to
hear
my
darling
if
you
feel
thus
you
will
not
hesitate
in
spite
of
the
cloud
of
infamy
that
hangs
over
our
honor
you
will
not
hesitate
i
will
not
say
to
give
yourself
to
me
for
that
you
have
already
done
but
to
become
my
hesitate
no
not
for
an
instant
not
for
a
second
to
do
it
is
the
joy
of
my
soul
the
happiness
of
my
life
your
wife
i
am
your
wife
in
the
sight
of
god
and
god
will
have
granted
my
every
prayer
on
the
day
that
he
enables
me
to
be
your
wife
before
morgan
fell
on
his
knees
then
he
said
here
at
your
feet
with
clasped
hands
and
my
whole
heart
supplicating
i
say
to
you
amélie
will
you
fly
with
me
will
you
leave
france
with
me
will
you
be
my
wife
in
other
lands
amélie
sprang
erect
and
clasped
her
head
in
her
hands
as
though
her
brain
were
bursting
with
the
force
of
the
blood
that
rushed
to
it
morgan
caught
both
her
hands
and
looked
at
her
anxiously
do
you
hesitate
he
asked
in
a
broken
trembling
voice
no
not
an
instant
she
cried
resolutely
i
am
yours
in
the
past
in
the
present
in
the
future
here
everywhere
only
the
thought
convulses
me
it
is
so
reflect
well
amélie
what
i
ask
of
you
is
to
abandon
country
and
family
all
that
is
dear
to
you
all
that
is
sacred
if
you
follow
me
you
leave
the
home
where
you
were
born
the
mother
who
nurtured
you
the
brother
who
loves
you
and
who
perhaps
when
he
hears
that
you
are
the
wife
of
a
brigand
will
hate
you
he
will
certainly
despise
as
he
spoke
morgan
s
eyes
were
anxiously
questioning
amélie
s
face
over
that
face
a
tender
smile
stole
gradually
and
then
it
turned
from
heaven
to
earth
and
bent
upon
morgan
who
was
still
on
his
knees
before
her
oh
charles
she
murmured
in
a
voice
as
soft
as
the
clear
limpid
river
flowing
at
her
feet
the
love
that
comes
direct
from
the
divine
is
very
powerful
indeed
since
in
spite
of
those
dreadful
words
you
have
just
uttered
i
say
to
you
without
hesitation
almost
without
regret
charles
i
am
here
charles
i
am
yours
where
shall
we
go
amélie
our
fate
is
not
one
to
discuss
if
we
go
if
you
follow
me
it
must
be
at
once
we
must
be
beyond
the
how
do
we
go
i
have
two
horses
ready
saddled
at
montagnac
one
for
you
amélie
and
one
for
me
i
have
letters
of
credit
for
two
hundred
thousand

the
young
man
sprang
from
the
boat
and
gave
his
hand
to
amélie
to
help
her
out
then
he
folded
his
arm
about
her
and
they
walked
to
the
house

the
portico

amélie
answered
with
a
kiss
then
she
ran
hastily
up
to
her
room
took
the
little
coffer
of
carved
oak
clamped
with
iron
her
treasury
which
contained
her
lover
s
letters
from
first
to
last
unfastened
from
the
mirror
above
her
bed
the
white
and
virginal
chaplet
that
hung
there
put
into
her
belt
a
watch
her
father
had
given
her
and
passed
into
her
mother
s
bedchamber
there
she
stooped
and
kissed
the
pillow
where
her
mother
s
head
had
lain
knelt
before
the
christ
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
began
a
thanksgiving
she
dared
not
finish
changed
it
to
a
prayer
and
then
suddenly
stopped
she
fancied
she
heard
charles
calling
her
she
listened
and
heard
her
name
a
second
time
uttered
in
a
tone
of
agony
she
could
not
understand
she
quivered
sprang
to
her
feet
and
ran
rapidly
down
the
stairs
what
is
it
cried
amélie
seizing
the
young
man
s
hand
listen
listen
said
he
amélie
strained
her
ears
to
catch
the
sound
which
seemed
to
her
like
musketry
it
came
from
the
direction
of
ceyzeriat
oh
cried
morgan
i
was
right
in
doubting
my
happiness
to
the
last
my
friends
are
attacked
adieu
amélie
adieu
adieu
cried
amélie
turning
pale
what
will
you
leave
me
the
sound
of
the
firing
grew
more
distinct
don
t
you
hear
them
they
are
fighting
and
i
am
not
there
to
fight
with
daughter
and
sister
of
a
soldier
amélie
understood
him
and
she
made
no
resistance
go
she
said
letting
her
hands
drop
beside
her
you
were
right
we
are
the
young
man
uttered
a
cry
of
rage
caught
her
to
his
breast
and
pressed
her
to
him
as
though
he
would
smother
her
then
bounding
from
the
portico
he
rushed
in
the
direction
of
the
firing
with
the
speed
of
a
deer
pursued
by
hunters
i
come
i
come
my
friends
he
cried
and
he
disappeared
like
a
shadow
beneath
the
tall
trees
of
the
park
amélie
fell
upon
her
knees
her
hands
stretched
toward
him
without
the
strength
to
recall
him
or
if
she
did
so
it
was
in
so
faint
a
voice
that
morgan
did
not
stop
or
even
check
his
speed
to
answer
her
chapter
xlix
roland
s
revenge
it
is
easy
to
guess
what
had
happened
roland
had
not
wasted
his
time
with
the
captain
of
gendarmerie
and
the
colonel
of
dragoons
they
on
their
side
did
not
forget
that
they
had
their
own
revenge
to
take
roland
had
informed
them
of
the
subterranean
passage
that
led
from
the
church
of
brou
to
the
grotto
of
ceyzeriat
at
nine
in
the
evening
the
captain
and
the
eighteen
men
under
his
command
were
to
go
to
the
church
descend
into
the
burial
vault
of
the
dukes
of
savoy
and
prevent
with
their
bayonets
all
communication
between
the
subterranean
passage
and
the
quarry
roland
at
the
head
of
twenty
men
was
to
inclose
the
woods
in
a
semicircle
drawing
in
upon
it
until
the
two
ends
should
meet
at
the
grotto
of
ceyzeriat
the
first
movement
of
the
party
was
to
be
made
at
nine
o
clock
in
conjunction
with
the
captain
of
the
gendarmerie
we
have
seen
from
what
morgan
told
amélie
the
nature
of
the
present
intentions
of
the
companions
of
jehu
the
news
brought
from
mittau
and
from
brittany
had
put
them
at
ease
each
man
felt
that
he
was
free
and
knowing
that
the
struggle
had
been
a
hopeless
one
he
rejoiced
in
his
liberty
there
was
therefore
a
full
meeting
at
the
grotto
of
ceyzeriat
almost
a
fête
at
twelve
o
clock
the
companions
of
jehu
were
to
separate
and
each
one
according
to
his
facilities
was
to
cross
the
frontier
and
leave
france
we
know
how
their
leader
employed
his
last
moments
the
others
who
had
not
the
same
ties
of
the
heart
were
supping
together
in
the
broad
open
space
of
the
quarry
brilliantly
illuminated
a
feast
of
separation
and
farewell
for
once
out
of
france
the
vendée
and
brittany
pacificated
condé
s
army
destroyed
who
knew
when
and
where
they
should
meet
again
in
foreign
lands
suddenly
the
report
of
a
shot
fell
upon
their
ears
every
man
sprang
to
his
feet
as
if
moved
by
an
electric
shock
a
second
shot
and
then
through
the
depths
of
the
quarry
rang
the
cry
quivering
on
the
wings
of
the
bird
of
to
arms
to
the
companions
of
jehu
subjected
to
all
the
vicissitudes
of
life
of
an
outlaw
the
occasional
rest
they
snatched
was
never
that
of
peace
pistols
daggers
carbines
were
ever
near
at
hand
at
the
cry
given
no
doubt
by
the
sentinel
each
man
sprang
to
his
weapons
and
stood
with
panting
breast
and
strained
ears
waiting
in
the
midst
of
the
silence
a
step
as
rapid
as
well
could
be
in
the
darkness
was
heard
then
within
the
circle
of
light
thrown
by
the
torches
and
candles
a
man
appeared
to
arms
he
cried
again
we
are
attacked
the
two
shots
the
companions
of
jehu
had
heard
were
from
the
gun
of
the
sentry
it
was
he
who
now
appeared
his
smoking
gun
in
his
hand
where
is
morgan
cried
twenty
voices
absent
replied
montbar
consequently
i
command
put
out
the
lights
and
retreat
to
the
church
a
fight
is
useless
now
it
would
only
be
waste
of
he
was
obeyed
with
an
alacrity
that
showed
that
every
one
appreciated
the
danger
the
little
company
drew
together
in
the
darkness
montbar
who
knew
the
windings
of
the
subterranean
passage
almost
as
well
as
morgan
directed
the
troop
and
followed
by
his
companions
he
plunged
into
the
heart
of
the
quarry
suddenly
as
he
neared
the
gate
of
the
passage
he
fancied
he
heard
an
order
given
in
a
low
tone
not
fifty
feet
away
then
a
sound
like
the
cocking
of
guns
he
stretched
out
both
arms
and
muttered
in
a
low
voice
halt
at
the
same
instant
came
the
command
this
time
perfectly
audible
fire
it
was
hardly
given
before
the
cavern
was
lighted
with
a
glare
followed
by
a
frightful
volley
ten
carbines
had
been
discharged
at
once
into
the
narrow
passage
by
their
light
montbar
and
his
companions
recognized
the
uniform
of
the
gendarmes
fire
cried
montbar
in
turn
seven
or
eight
shots
answered
the
command
again
the
darkness
was
illuminated
two
of
the
companions
of
jehu
lay
upon
the
ground
one
killed
outright
the
other
mortally
wounded
our
retreat
is
cut
off
my
friends
cried
montbar
to
the
if
we
have
a
chance
it
is
through
the
the
movement
was
executed
with
the
precision
of
a
military
manoeuvre
montbar
again
at
the
head
of
his
companions
retraced
his
steps
at
that
moment
the
gendarmes
fired
again
but
no
one
replied
those
who
had
discharged
their
guns
reloaded
them
those
who
had
not
reserved
their
fire
for
the
real
struggle
which
was
to
come
one
or
two
sighs
alone
told
that
the
last
volley
of
the
gendarmes
had
not
been
without
result
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
montbar
stopped
the
little
party
had
reached
the
open
space
of
the
quarry
are
your
pistols
and
guns
all
loaded
he
asked
yes
answered
a
dozen
voices
remember
the
order
for
those
who
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
police
we
belong
to
the
army
of
de
teyssonnet
and
we
are
here
to
recruit
men
for
the
royalist
cause
if
they
talk
to
us
of
and
diligences
we
don
t
know
what
they
in
either
case
it
will
be
death
we
know
that
well
enough
but
the
death
of
a
soldier
is
better
than
that
of
thieves
the
volley
of
a
platoon
rather
than
the
yes
yes
cried
a
mocking
voice
we
know
what
that
is
vive
la
fusillade
forward
friends
said
montbar
and
let
us
sell
our
lives
for
what
they
are
worth
that
is
to
say
as
dearly
as
forward
they
all
cried
then
as
rapidly
as
was
possible
in
the
profound
darkness
the
little
troop
resumed
its
march
still
under
the
guidance
of
montbar
as
they
advanced
the
leader
noticed
a
smell
of
smoke
which
alarmed
him
at
the
same
time
gleams
of
light
began
to
flicker
on
the
granite
walls
at
the
angles
of
the
path
showing
that
something
strange
was
happening
at
the
opening
of
the
grotto
i
believe
those
scoundrels
are
smoking
us
out
exclaimed
montbar
i
fear
so
replied
adler
they
think
we
are
oh
replied
the
same
voice
they
shall
know
by
our
claws
that
we
are
the
smoke
became
thicker
and
thicker
the
light
more
and
more
vivid
they
turned
the
last
corner
a
pile
of
dried
wood
had
been
lighted
in
the
quarry
about
fifty
feet
from
the
entrance
not
for
the
smoke
but
for
the
light
it
gave
by
the
blaze
of
that
savage
flame
the
weapons
of
the
dragoons
could
be
seen
gleaming
at
the
entrance
of
the
grotto
ten
steps
in
advance
of
the
men
stood
an
officer
waiting
he
was
leaning
on
his
carbine
not
only
exposed
to
attack
but
apparently
courting
it
it
was
roland
he
was
easily
recognized
he
had
flung
his
cap
away
his
head
was
bare
and
the
fitful
light
of
the
flames
played
upon
his
features
but
that
which
should
have
cost
him
his
life
saved
him
montbar
recognized
him
and
stepped
backward
roland
de
montrevel
he
said
remember
morgan
s
yes
replied
the
other
companions
in
muffled
tones
and
now
said
montbar
let
us
die
but
dearly
and
he
sprang
forward
into
the
space
illuminated
by
the
fire
and
discharged
one
barrel
of
his
gun
at
the
dragoons
who
replied
with
a
volley
it
would
be
impossible
to
relate
all
that
followed
the
grotto
was
filled
with
smoke
which
the
flame
of
each
weapon
pierced
like
a
flash
of
lightning
the
two
bands
clinched
and
fought
hand
to
hand
pistols
and
daggers
serving
them
in
turn
at
the
noise
of
the
struggle
the
gendarmes
poured
in
from
the
rear
few
more
demons
added
to
this
fight
of
devils
but
the
groups
of
friends
and
enemies
were
so
confused
they
dared
not
fire
they
struggled
in
the
red
and
lurid
atmosphere
fell
down
and
rose
again
a
roar
of
rage
was
heard
then
a
cry
of
agony
the
death
sigh
of
a
man
the
survivor
sought
another
man
and
the
struggle
was
renewed
this
work
of
death
lasted
fifteen
minutes
perhaps
twenty
at
the
end
of
those
twenty
minutes
twenty
corpses
could
be
counted
in
the
grotto
of
ceyzeriat
thirteen
were
those
of
the
gendarmes
and
the
dragoons
nine
belonged
to
the
companions
of
jehu
five
of
the
latter
were
still
living
overwhelmed
by
numbers
crippled
by
wounds
they
were
taken
alive
the
gendarmes
and
the
dragoons
in
number
surrounded
them
the
captain
of
gendarmes
had
his
arm
shattered
the
colonel
of
dragoons
was
wounded
in
the
thigh
roland
alone
covered
with
blood
that
was
not
his
own
had
not
a
scratch
two
of
the
prisoners
were
so
grievously
wounded
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
walk
and
the
soldiers
were
obliged
to
carry
them
on
an
improvised
litter
torches
were
lighted
and
the
whole
troop
with
the
prisoners
took
the
road
to
the
town
as
they
were
leaving
the
forest
to
branch
into
the
the
gallop
of
a
horse
was
heard
it
came
on
rapidly
go
on
said
roland
i
will
stay
here
and
find
out
what
this
it
was
a
rider
who
as
we
have
said
was
advancing
at
full
speed
who
goes
there
cried
roland
raising
his
carbine
when
the
rider
was
about
twenty
paces
from
him
one
more
prisoner
monsieur
de
montrevel
replied
the
rider
i
could
not
be
in
at
the
fight
but
i
will
at
least
go
to
the
scaffold
where
are
my
friends
there
sir
replied
roland
who
had
recognized
not
the
face
but
the
voice
of
the
rider
a
voice
which
he
now
heard
for
the
third
time
as
he
spoke
he
pointed
to
the
little
group
in
the
centre
of
the
soldiers
who
were
making
their
way
along
the
road
from
ceyzeriat
to
bourg
i
am
glad
to
see
that
no
harm
has
befallen
you
de
montrevel
said
the
young
man
with
great
courtesy
i
assure
you
it
gives
me
much
and
spurring
his
horse
he
was
beside
the
soldiers
and
gendarmes
in
a
few
strides
pardon
me
gentlemen
he
said
springing
from
his
horse
i
claim
a
place
among
my
three
friends
the
vicomte
de
jayat
the
comte
de
valensolle
and
the
marquis
de
the
three
prisoners
gave
a
cry
of
admiration
and
held
out
their
hands
to
their
friend
the
two
wounded
men
lifted
themselves
up
on
their
litters
and
murmured
well
done
well
done
i
do
believe
god
help
me
cried
roland
that
those
brigands
will
have
the
nobler
side
of
the
affair
chapter
cadoudal
at
the
tuileries
the
day
but
one
after
the
events
which
we
have
just
related
took
place
two
men
were
walking
side
by
side
up
and
down
the
grand
salon
of
the
tuileries
they
were
talking
eagerly
accompanying
their
words
with
hasty
and
animated
gestures
these
men
were
the
first
consul
bonaparte
and
cadoudal
cadoudal
impelled
by
the
misery
that
might
be
entailed
by
a
prolonged
struggle
in
brittany
had
just
signed
a
peace
with
brune
it
was
after
this
signing
of
the
peace
that
he
had
released
the
companions
of
jehu
from
their
obligations
unhappily
this
release
had
reached
them
as
we
have
seen
hours
too
late
when
treating
with
brune
cadoudal
had
asked
nothing
for
himself
save
the
liberty
to
go
immediately
to
england
but
brune
had
been
so
insistent
that
he
had
consented
to
an
interview
with
the
first
consul
he
had
in
consequence
come
to
paris
the
very
morning
of
his
arrival
he
went
to
the
tuileries
sent
in
his
name
and
had
been
received
it
was
rapp
who
in
roland
s
absence
introduced
him
as
the
withdrew
he
left
both
doors
open
so
as
to
see
everything
from
bourrienne
s
room
and
to
be
able
to
go
to
the
assistance
of
the
first
consul
if
necessary
but
bonaparte
who
perfectly
understood
rapp
s
motive
closed
the
door
then
returning
hastily
to
cadoudal
s
side
he
said
ah
so
it
is
you
at
last
one
of
your
enemies
my
roland
de
montrevel
has
told
me
fine
things
of
that
does
not
surprise
me
replied
cadoudal
during
the
short
time
i
saw
de
montrevel
i
recognized
in
him
a
most
chivalrous
yes
and
that
touched
you
asked
the
first
consul
fixing
his
falcon
eye
on
the
royalist
chief
listen
georges
i
need
energetic
men
like
you
to
accomplish
the
work
i
have
undertaken
will
you
be
one
of
them
i
have
already
offered
you
the
rank
of
colonel
but
you
are
worth
more
than
that
i
now
offer
you
the
rank
of
general
of
i
thank
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
citizen
first
consul
replied
cadoudal
but
you
would
despise
me
if
i
why
so
queried
bonaparte
hastily
because
i
have
pledged
myself
to
the
house
of
bourbon
and
i
shall
remain
faithful
to
it
under
all
let
us
discuss
the
matter
resumed
the
first
consul
is
there
no
way
to
bind
you
general
replied
the
royalist
leader
may
i
be
permitted
to
repeat
to
you
what
has
been
said
to
me
why
not
because
it
touches
upon
the
deepest
political
pooh
some
nonsense
said
the
first
consul
smiling
uneasily
cadoudal
stopped
short
and
looked
fixedly
at
his
companion
it
is
said
that
an
agreement
was
made
between
you
and
commodore
sidney
smith
at
alexandria
the
purport
of
which
was
to
allow
you
to
return
to
france
on
the
condition
accepted
by
you
of
restoring
the
throne
to
our
former
bonaparte
burst
out
laughing
how
astonishing
you
are
you
plebeians
he
said
with
your
love
for
your
former
kings
suppose
that
i
did
the
throne
a
thing
i
assure
you
i
have
not
the
smallest
desire
to
do
what
return
will
you
get
you
who
have
shed
your
blood
for
the
cause
not
even
the
confirmation
of
the
rank
you
have
won
in
it
colonel
have
you
ever
known
in
the
royalist
ranks
a
colonel
who
was
not
a
noble
did
you
ever
hear
of
any
man
rising
by
his
merits
into
that
class
of
people
whereas
with
me
georges
you
can
attain
to
what
you
will
the
higher
i
raise
myself
the
higher
i
shall
raise
those
who
surround
me
as
for
seeing
me
play
the
part
of
monk
dismiss
that
from
your
mind
monk
lived
in
an
age
in
which
the
prejudices
we
fought
and
overthrew
in
were
in
full
force
had
monk
wished
to
make
himself
king
he
could
not
have
done
so
dictator
no
it
needed
a
cromwell
for
that
richard
could
not
have
maintained
himself
it
is
true
that
he
was
the
true
son
of
a
great
man
in
other
words
a
fool
if
i
had
wished
to
make
myself
king
there
was
nothing
to
hinder
me
and
if
ever
the
wish
takes
me
there
will
be
nothing
to
hinder
now
if
you
have
an
answer
to
that
give
you
tell
me
citizen
first
consul
that
the
situation
in
france
in
is
not
the
same
as
england
in
charles
was
beheaded
in
louis
xvi
in
eleven
years
elapsed
in
england
between
the
death
of
the
king
and
the
restoration
of
his
son
seven
years
have
already
elapsed
in
france
since
the
death
of
louis
xvi
will
you
tell
me
that
the
english
revolution
was
a
religious
one
whereas
the
french
revolution
was
a
political
one
to
that
i
reply
that
a
charter
is
as
easy
to
make
as
an
bonaparte
smiled
no
he
said
i
should
not
tell
you
that
i
should
say
to
you
simply
this
that
cromwell
was
fifty
years
old
when
charles
died
i
was
at
the
death
of
louis
xvi
cromwell
died
at
the
age
of
in
ten
years
time
he
was
able
to
undertake
much
but
to
accomplish
little
besides
his
reform
was
a
total
one
a
vast
political
reform
by
the
substitution
of
a
republican
government
for
a
monarchical
one
well
grant
that
i
live
to
be
cromwell
s
age
that
is
not
too
much
to
expect
i
shall
still
have
twenty
years
just
the
double
of
cromwell
and
remark
i
change
nothing
i
progress
i
do
not
overthrow
i
build
up
suppose
that
cæsar
at
thirty
years
of
age
instead
of
being
merely
the
first
roué
of
rome
had
been
its
greatest
citizen
suppose
his
campaign
in
gaul
had
been
made
that
his
campaign
in
egypt
was
over
his
campaign
in
spain
happily
concluded
suppose
that
he
was
thirty
years
old
instead
of
fifty
don
t
you
think
he
would
have
been
both
cæsar
and
augustus
yes
unless
he
found
brutus
cassius
and
casca
on
his
so
said
bonaparte
sadly
my
enemies
are
reckoning
on
assassination
are
they
in
that
case
the
thing
is
easy
and
you
my
enemy
have
the
first
chance
what
hinders
you
at
this
moment
if
you
feel
like
brutus
from
striking
me
as
he
struck
cæsar
i
am
alone
with
you
the
doors
are
shut
and
you
would
have
the
time
to
finish
me
before
any
one
could
reach
cadoudal
made
a
step
backward
no
said
he
we
do
not
count
upon
assassination
and
i
think
our
extremity
must
be
great
indeed
before
any
of
us
would
become
a
murderer
but
there
are
the
chances
of
war
a
single
reverse
would
destroy
your
prestige
one
defeat
would
bring
the
enemy
to
the
heart
of
france
the
of
the
austrians
can
already
be
seen
from
the
frontiers
of
provence
a
may
take
off
your
head
as
it
did
that
of
marshal
berwick
and
then
what
becomes
of
france
you
have
no
children
and
your
brothers
oh
cried
bonaparte
from
that
point
of
view
you
are
right
enough
but
if
you
don
t
believe
in
providence
i
do
i
believe
that
nothing
happens
by
chance
i
believe
that
when
on
the
of
august
one
year
day
for
day
after
louis
xv
issued
the
decree
reuniting
corsica
to
france
a
child
was
born
in
ajaccio
destined
to
bring
about
the
vendémiaire
and
the
brumaire
and
that
providence
had
great
designs
mighty
projects
in
view
for
that
child
i
am
that
child
if
i
have
a
mission
i
have
nothing
to
fear
my
mission
is
a
buckler
if
i
have
no
mission
if
i
am
mistaken
if
instead
of
living
the
or
thirty
years
i
need
to
accomplish
my
work
i
am
stabbed
to
the
heart
like
cæsar
or
knocked
over
by
a
like
berwick
providence
will
have
had
its
reasons
for
acting
so
and
on
providence
will
devolve
the
duty
of
providing
for
france
we
spoke
just
now
of
cæsar
when
rome
followed
his
body
mourning
and
burned
the
houses
of
his
murderers
when
the
eternal
city
turned
its
eyes
to
the
four
quarters
of
the
globe
asking
whence
would
come
the
genius
to
stay
her
civil
wars
when
she
trembled
at
the
sight
of
drunken
antony
and
treacherous
lepidus
she
never
thought
of
the
pupil
of
apollonius
the
nephew
of
cæsar
the
young
octavius
who
then
remembered
that
son
of
the
velletri
banker
whitened
with
the
flour
of
his
ancestors
no
one
not
even
the
cicero
et
he
said
well
that
lad
fooled
all
the
graybeards
in
the
senate
and
reigned
almost
as
long
as
louis
xiv
georges
georges
don
t
struggle
against
the
providence
which
created
me
or
that
providence
will
destroy
then
i
shall
be
destroyed
while
following
the
path
and
the
religion
of
my
fathers
replied
cadoudal
bowing
and
i
hope
that
god
will
pardon
my
error
which
will
be
that
of
a
fervent
christian
and
a
faithful
bonaparte
laid
his
hands
on
the
shoulders
of
the
young
leader
so
be
it
said
he
but
at
least
remain
neuter
leave
events
to
complete
themselves
watch
the
thrones
as
they
topple
the
crowns
as
they
fall
usually
spectators
pay
for
a
show
i
will
pay
you
to
look
and
what
will
you
pay
me
for
that
citizen
first
consul
asked
cadoudal
laughing
one
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
replied
bonaparte
if
you
would
give
a
hundred
thousand
francs
to
one
poor
rebel
leader
said
cadoudal
what
would
you
give
to
the
prince
for
whom
he
fought
nothing
sir
i
pay
you
for
your
courage
not
for
the
principle
for
which
you
fought
i
prove
to
you
that
i
man
of
my
own
works
judge
men
solely
by
theirs
accept
georges
i
beg
of
and
suppose
i
refuse
you
will
do
will
i
still
be
free
to
depart
when
i
please
bonaparte
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
the
on
duty
he
said
he
waited
expecting
to
see
rapp
roland
appeared
ah
is
it
you
he
cried
then
turning
to
cadoudal
he
said
colonel
i
do
not
need
to
present
to
you
my
roland
de
montrevel
he
is
already
one
of
your
acquaintances
roland
tell
the
colonel
that
he
is
as
free
in
paris
as
you
were
in
his
camp
at
muzillac
and
that
if
he
wishes
a
passport
for
any
country
in
the
world
fouché
has
orders
to
give
it
to
your
word
suffices
citizen
first
consul
replied
cadoudal
bowing
i
leave
may
i
ask
where
you
are
going
to
london
so
much
the
why
so
much
the
better
because
there
you
will
be
near
the
men
for
whom
you
have
and
then
then
when
you
have
seen
them
what
you
will
compare
them
with
those
against
whom
you
have
fought
but
once
out
of
france
colonel
bonaparte
paused
i
am
waiting
said
cadoudal
do
not
return
without
warning
me
or
if
you
do
do
not
be
surprised
if
i
treat
you
as
an
that
would
be
an
honor
general
by
treating
me
so
you
will
show
that
you
consider
me
a
man
to
be
so
saying
georges
bowed
to
the
first
consul
and
retired
well
general
asked
roland
after
the
door
had
closed
on
the
breton
leader
is
he
the
man
i
represented
him
to
be
yes
responded
bonaparte
thoughtfully
only
he
sees
things
awry
but
the
exaggeration
of
his
ideas
arises
from
noble
sentiments
which
must
give
him
great
influence
over
his
own
then
he
added
in
a
low
voice
but
we
must
make
an
end
of
him
and
now
what
have
you
been
doing
roland
making
an
end
of
my
work
replied
roland
ah
ha
then
the
companions
of
jehu
no
longer
exist
general
are
dead
the
rest
and
you
are
safe
and
sound
don
t
speak
of
it
general
i
do
verily
believe
i
have
a
compact
with
the
that
same
evening
cadoudal
as
he
said
left
paris
for
england
on
receiving
the
news
that
the
breton
leader
was
in
london
louis
xviii
wrote
him
the
following
letter
i
have
learned
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
general
that
you
have
at
last
from
the
bands
of
the
tyrant
who
misconceived
you
so
far
as
to
offer
you
service
under
him
i
deplore
the
unhappy
circumstances
which
obliged
you
to
treat
with
him
but
i
did
not
feel
the
slightest
uneasiness
the
heart
of
my
faithful
bretons
and
yours
in
particular
are
too
well
known
to
me
you
are
free
you
are
near
my
brother
all
my
hopes
revive
i
need
not
say
more
to
such
a
frenchman
as
you
louis
to
this
letter
were
added
a
s
commission
and
the
grand
cordon
of
chapter
li
the
army
of
the
reserves
the
first
consul
had
reached
the
point
he
desired
the
companions
of
jehu
were
destroyed
and
the
vendée
was
pacificated
when
demanding
peace
from
england
he
had
hoped
for
war
he
understood
very
well
that
born
of
war
he
could
exist
only
by
war
he
seemed
to
foresee
that
a
poet
would
arise
and
call
him
the
giant
of
but
war
what
war
where
should
he
wage
it
an
article
of
the
constitution
of
the
year
viii
forbade
the
first
consul
to
command
the
armies
in
person
or
to
leave
france
in
all
constitutions
there
is
inevitably
some
absurd
provision
happy
the
constitutions
that
have
but
one
the
first
consul
found
a
means
to
evade
this
particular
absurdity
he
established
a
camp
at
dijon
the
army
which
occupied
this
camp
was
called
the
army
of
the
reserves
the
force
withdrawn
from
brittany
and
the
vendée
some
thirty
thousand
men
in
all
formed
the
nucleus
of
this
army
twenty
thousand
conscripts
were
incorporated
in
it
general
berthier
was
appointed
the
plan
which
bonaparte
explained
to
roland
in
his
study
one
day
was
still
working
in
his
mind
he
expected
to
recover
italy
by
a
single
battle
but
that
battle
must
be
a
great
victory
moreau
as
a
reward
for
his
on
the
brumaire
received
the
command
he
had
so
much
desired
he
was
made
of
the
army
of
the
rhine
with
eighty
thousand
men
under
him
augereau
with
thousand
more
was
on
the
dutch
frontier
and
masséna
commanding
the
army
of
italy
had
withdrawn
to
the
country
about
genoa
where
he
was
tenaciously
maintaining
himself
against
the
land
forces
of
the
austrian
general
ott
and
the
british
fleet
under
admiral
keith
while
the
latter
movements
were
taking
place
in
italy
moreau
had
assumed
the
offensive
on
the
rhine
and
defeated
the
enemy
at
stockach
and
moeskirch
a
single
victory
was
to
furnish
an
excuse
to
put
the
army
of
reserves
under
waiting
orders
two
victories
would
leave
no
doubt
as
to
the
necessity
of
only
how
was
this
army
to
be
transported
to
italy
bonaparte
s
first
thought
was
to
march
up
the
valais
and
to
cross
the
simplon
he
would
thus
turn
piedmont
and
enter
milan
but
the
operation
was
a
long
one
and
must
be
done
overtly
bonaparte
renounced
it
his
plan
was
to
surprise
the
austrians
and
to
appear
with
his
whole
army
on
the
plains
of
piedmont
before
it
was
even
suspected
that
he
had
crossed
the
alps
he
therefore
decided
to
make
the
passage
of
the
great
it
was
for
this
purpose
that
he
had
sent
the
fifty
thousand
francs
seized
by
the
companions
of
jehu
to
the
monks
whose
monastery
crowns
that
mountain
another
fifty
thousand
had
been
sent
since
which
had
reached
their
destination
safely
by
the
help
of
this
money
the
monastery
was
to
be
amply
provisioned
for
an
army
of
fifty
thousand
men
halting
there
for
a
day
consequently
toward
the
end
of
april
the
whole
of
the
artillery
was
advanced
to
lauzanne
villeneuve
martigny
and
general
marmont
commanding
the
artillery
had
already
been
sent
forward
to
find
a
means
of
transporting
cannon
over
the
alps
it
was
almost
an
impracticable
thing
to
do
and
yet
it
must
be
achieved
no
precedent
existed
as
a
guide
hannibal
with
his
elephants
numidians
and
gauls
charlemagne
with
his
franks
had
no
such
obstacles
to
surmount
during
the
campaign
in
italy
in
the
army
had
not
crossed
the
alps
but
turned
them
descending
from
nice
to
cerasco
by
the
corniche
road
this
time
a
truly
titanic
work
was
undertaken
in
the
first
place
was
the
mountain
unoccupied
the
mountain
without
the
austrians
was
in
itself
difficult
enough
to
conquer
lannes
was
despatched
like
a
forlorn
hope
with
a
whole
division
he
crossed
the
peak
of
the
without
baggage
or
artillery
and
took
possession
of
châtillon
the
austrians
had
left
no
troops
in
piedmont
except
the
cavalry
in
barracks
and
a
few
posts
of
observation
there
were
no
obstacles
to
contend
with
except
those
of
nature
operations
were
begun
at
once
sledges
had
been
made
to
transport
the
guns
but
narrow
as
they
might
be
they
were
still
too
wide
for
the
road
some
other
means
must
be
devised
the
trunks
of
pines
were
hollowed
and
the
guns
inserted
at
one
end
was
a
rope
to
pull
them
at
the
other
a
tiller
to
guide
them
twenty
grenadiers
took
the
cables
twenty
others
carried
the
baggage
of
those
who
drew
them
an
artilleryman
commanded
each
detachment
with
absolute
power
if
need
be
over
life
and
death
the
iron
mass
in
such
a
case
was
far
more
precious
than
the
flesh
of
men
before
leaving
each
man
received
a
pair
of
new
shoes
and
twenty
biscuits
each
put
on
his
shoes
and
hung
his
biscuits
around
his
neck
the
first
consul
stationed
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
gave
to
each
cannon
detachment
the
word
to
start
a
man
must
traverse
the
same
roads
as
a
tourist
on
foot
or
on
he
must
plunge
his
eye
to
the
depth
of
the
precipice
before
he
can
have
any
idea
of
what
this
crossing
was
up
always
up
those
beetling
slopes
by
narrow
paths
on
jagged
stones
which
cut
the
shoes
first
the
feet
next
from
time
to
time
they
stopped
drew
breath
and
then
on
again
without
a
murmur
the
was
reached
before
attempting
it
the
men
received
new
shoes
those
of
the
morning
were
in
shreds
a
biscuit
was
eaten
a
drop
of
brandy
from
the
canteen
was
swallowed
and
on
they
went
no
man
knew
whither
he
was
climbing
some
asked
how
many
more
days
it
would
take
others
if
they
might
stop
for
a
moment
at
the
moon
at
last
they
came
to
the
eternal
snows
there
the
toil
was
less
severe
the
slid
upon
the
snow
and
they
went
faster
one
fact
will
show
the
measure
of
power
given
to
the
artilleryman
who
commanded
each
gun
general
chamberlhac
was
passing
he
thought
the
advance
not
fast
enough
wishing
to
hasten
it
he
spoke
to
an
artilleryman
in
a
tone
of
command
you
are
not
in
command
here
replied
the
man
i
am
i
am
responsible
for
the
gun
i
direct
its
march
pass
the
general
approached
the
artilleryman
as
if
to
take
him
by
the
throat
but
the
man
stepped
back
saying
general
don
t
touch
me
or
i
will
send
you
to
the
bottom
of
that
precipice
with
a
blow
of
this
after
toil
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
last
rise
at
the
summit
of
which
stands
the
convent
there
they
found
traces
of
lannes
division
as
the
slope
was
very
steep
the
soldiers
had
cut
a
sort
of
stairway
in
the
ice
the
men
now
scaled
it
the
fathers
of
were
awaiting
them
on
the
summit
as
each
gun
came
up
the
men
were
taken
by
squads
into
the
hospice
tables
were
set
along
the
passage
with
bread
and
gruyere
cheese
and
wine
when
the
soldiers
left
the
convent
they
pressed
the
hands
of
the
monks
and
embraced
the
dogs
the
descent
at
first
seemed
easier
than
the
ascent
and
the
officers
declared
it
was
their
turn
to
drag
the
guns
but
now
the
cannon
outstripped
the
teams
and
some
were
dragged
down
faster
than
they
wished
general
lannes
and
his
division
were
still
in
the
advance
he
had
reached
the
valley
before
the
rest
of
the
army
entered
the
aosta
and
received
his
orders
to
march
upon
ivrea
at
the
entrance
to
the
plains
of
piedmont
there
however
he
encountered
an
obstacle
which
no
one
had
foreseen
the
fortress
of
bard
is
situated
about
miles
from
aosta
on
the
road
to
ivrea
a
little
behind
the
village
a
small
hill
closes
the
valley
almost
hermetically
the
river
dora
flows
between
this
hill
and
the
mountain
on
the
right
the
river
or
rather
the
torrent
fills
the
whole
space
the
mountain
on
the
left
presents
very
much
the
same
aspect
only
instead
of
the
river
it
is
the
highroad
which
passes
between
the
hill
and
the
mountain
it
is
there
that
the
fortress
of
bard
stands
it
is
built
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
and
extends
down
one
side
of
it
to
the
highroad
how
was
it
that
no
one
had
thought
of
this
obstacle
which
was
well
nigh
insurmountable
there
was
no
way
to
assault
it
from
the
bottom
of
the
valley
and
it
was
impossible
to
scale
the
rocks
above
it
yet
by
dint
of
searching
they
did
find
a
path
that
they
were
able
to
level
sufficiently
for
the
cavalry
and
the
infantry
to
pass
but
they
tried
in
vain
to
get
the
artillery
over
it
although
they
took
the
guns
apart
as
at
the
mont
bonaparte
ordered
two
cannon
levelled
on
the
road
and
opened
fire
on
the
fortress
but
it
was
soon
evident
that
these
guns
made
no
effect
moreover
a
cannon
ball
from
the
fortress
struck
one
of
the
two
cannon
and
shattered
it
the
first
consul
then
ordered
an
assault
by
storm
columns
formed
in
the
village
and
armed
with
ladders
dashed
up
at
a
run
and
reached
the
fortress
at
several
points
but
to
insure
success
not
only
celerity
but
silence
was
needed
it
ought
to
have
been
a
surprise
but
colonel
dufour
who
commanded
one
column
ordered
the
advance
to
be
sounded
and
marched
boldly
to
the
assault
the
column
was
repulsed
and
the
colonel
received
a
ball
through
his
body
then
a
company
of
picked
marksmen
were
chosen
they
were
supplied
with
provisions
and
cartridges
and
crept
between
the
rocks
until
they
reached
a
ledge
from
which
they
commanded
the
fort
from
this
ledge
they
discovered
another
not
quite
so
high
but
which
also
overlooked
the
fort
to
this
they
contrived
with
extreme
difficulty
to
hoist
two
guns
with
which
they
formed
a
battery
these
two
pieces
on
one
side
and
the
sharpshooters
on
the
other
began
to
make
the
enemy
uneasy
in
the
meantime
general
marmont
proposed
a
plan
to
the
first
consul
so
bold
that
the
enemy
could
not
suspect
it
it
was
nothing
less
than
to
move
the
artillery
along
the
highroad
notwithstanding
that
the
enemy
could
rake
it
manure
and
wool
from
the
mattresses
were
found
in
the
villages
and
were
spread
upon
the
road
the
wheels
and
chains
and
all
the
jingling
portions
of
the
were
swathed
in
hay
the
horses
belonging
to
the
guns
and
caissons
were
taken
out
and
fifty
men
supplied
their
places
this
latter
precaution
had
two
advantages
first
the
horses
might
neigh
while
the
men
had
every
interest
in
keeping
dead
silence
secondly
a
dead
horse
will
stop
a
whole
convoy
whereas
a
dead
man
not
being
fastened
to
the
traces
can
be
pushed
aside
and
his
place
taken
without
even
stopping
the
march
an
officer
and
a
subordinate
officer
of
artillery
were
placed
in
charge
of
each
carriage
or
caisson
with
the
promise
of
six
hundred
francs
for
the
transport
of
each
gun
or
wagon
beyond
the
range
of
the
fort
general
marmont
who
had
proposed
the
plan
superintended
the
first
operation
himself
happily
a
storm
prevailed
and
made
the
night
extremely
dark
the
first
six
cannon
and
the
first
six
caissons
passed
without
a
single
shot
from
the
fortress
the
men
returned
picking
their
steps
silently
one
after
another
in
single
file
but
this
time
the
enemy
must
have
heard
some
noise
and
wishing
to
knew
the
cause
threw
fortunately
they
fell
beyond
the
road
why
should
these
men
who
had
once
passed
return
merely
to
get
their
muskets
and
knapsacks
this
might
have
been
avoided
had
they
been
stowed
on
the
caissons
but
no
one
can
think
of
everything
and
as
it
happened
no
one
in
the
fort
at
bard
had
thought
at
all
as
soon
as
the
possibility
of
the
passage
was
demonstrated
the
transport
of
the
artillery
became
a
duty
like
any
other
only
now
that
the
enemy
were
warned
it
was
more
dangerous
the
fort
resembled
a
volcano
with
its
belching
flames
and
smoke
but
owing
to
the
vertical
direction
in
which
it
was
forced
to
fire
it
made
more
noise
than
it
did
harm
five
or
six
men
were
killed
to
each
wagon
that
is
to
say
a
tenth
of
each
fifty
but
the
cannon
once
safely
past
the
fate
of
the
campaign
was
secure
later
it
was
discovered
that
the
pass
of
the
little
would
have
been
practicable
and
that
the
whole
artillery
could
have
crossed
it
without
dismounting
a
gun
or
losing
a
man
it
is
true
however
that
the
feat
would
have
been
less
glorious
because
less
difficult
the
army
was
now
in
the
fertile
plains
of
piedmont
it
was
reinforced
on
the
ticino
by
a
corps
of
twelve
thousand
men
detached
from
the
army
of
the
rhine
by
moreau
who
after
the
two
victories
he
had
just
won
could
afford
to
lend
this
contingent
to
the
army
of
italy
he
had
sent
them
by
the
thus
strengthened
the
first
consul
entered
milan
without
striking
a
blow
by
the
bye
how
came
the
first
consul
who
according
to
a
provision
of
the
constitution
of
the
year
could
not
assume
command
of
the
army
nor
yet
leave
france
to
be
where
he
was
we
shall
now
tell
you
the
evening
before
the
day
on
which
he
left
paris
that
is
to
say
the
of
may
or
according
to
the
calendars
of
the
time
the
floreal
he
had
sent
for
the
two
other
consuls
and
all
the
ministers
saying
to
lucien
prepare
a
circular
letter
to
the
prefects
then
he
said
to
fouché
you
will
publish
the
circular
in
all
the
newspapers
you
are
to
say
that
i
have
left
for
dijon
to
inspect
the
army
of
the
reserves
add
but
without
affirming
it
positively
that
i
may
go
as
far
as
geneva
in
any
case
let
it
be
well
impressed
on
everyone
that
i
shall
not
be
absent
more
than
a
fortnight
if
anything
unusual
happens
i
shall
return
like
a
thunderclap
i
commend
to
your
keeping
all
the
great
interests
of
france
and
i
hope
you
will
soon
hear
of
me
by
way
of
vienna
and
on
the
he
started
from
that
moment
his
strong
determination
was
to
make
his
way
to
the
plains
of
piedmont
and
there
to
fight
a
decisive
battle
then
as
he
never
doubted
that
he
would
conquer
he
would
answer
like
scipio
to
those
who
accused
him
of
violating
the
constitution
on
such
a
day
at
such
an
hour
i
fought
the
carthagenians
let
us
go
to
the
capitol
and
render
thanks
to
the
leaving
france
on
the
of
may
the
first
consul
was
encamped
with
his
whole
army
between
casale
and
turin
on
the
of
the
same
month
it
had
rained
the
whole
day
but
as
often
happens
in
italy
toward
evening
the
sky
had
cleared
changing
in
a
few
moments
from
murky
darkness
to
loveliest
azure
and
the
stars
came
sparkling
out
the
first
consul
signed
to
roland
to
follow
him
and
together
they
issued
from
the
little
town
of
chivasso
and
walked
along
the
banks
of
the
river
about
a
hundred
yards
beyond
the
last
house
a
tree
blown
down
by
the
wind
offered
a
seat
to
the
pedestrians
bonaparte
sat
down
and
signed
to
roland
to
join
him
he
apparently
had
something
to
say
some
confidence
to
make
to
his
young
both
were
silent
for
a
time
and
then
bonaparte
said
roland
do
you
remember
a
conversation
we
had
together
at
the
luxembourg
general
said
roland
laughing
we
had
a
good
many
conversations
together
at
the
luxembourg
in
one
of
which
you
told
me
we
were
to
cross
into
italy
in
the
spring
and
fight
general
mélas
at
torre
di
gallifolo
or
does
that
still
hold
good
yes
but
that
is
not
the
conversation
i
what
was
it
general
the
day
we
talked
of
ah
yes
my
sister
s
marriage
that
has
probably
taken
place
by
this
time
i
don
t
mean
your
sister
s
marriage
i
mean
good
said
roland
with
a
bitter
smile
i
thought
that
had
been
disposed
of
and
he
made
a
motion
as
if
to
rise
bonaparte
caught
him
by
the
arm
do
you
know
whom
i
meant
you
to
marry
at
that
time
roland
he
said
with
a
gravity
that
showed
he
was
determined
to
be
heard
no
well
my
sister
your
sister
yes
does
that
astonish
you
i
had
no
idea
you
had
ever
thought
of
doing
me
that
either
you
are
ungrateful
roland
or
you
are
saying
what
you
do
not
mean
you
know
that
i
love
oh
my
general
he
took
the
first
consul
s
two
hands
and
pressed
them
with
the
deepest
gratitude
yes
i
should
have
liked
you
for
my
your
sister
and
murat
love
each
other
general
said
roland
it
is
much
better
that
the
plan
should
have
gone
no
further
besides
he
added
in
muffled
tones
i
thought
i
told
you
that
i
did
not
care
to
bonaparte
smiled
why
don
t
you
say
offhand
that
you
intend
becoming
a
trappist
father
faith
general
the
cloisters
and
remove
these
opportunities
for
me
to
try
to
get
myself
killed
which
thank
god
are
not
lacking
and
you
have
guessed
what
my
end
will
are
you
in
love
is
this
the
result
of
some
woman
s
faithlessness
good
said
roland
so
you
think
i
am
in
love
that
is
the
last
straw
do
you
complain
of
my
affection
when
i
wished
to
marry
you
to
my
sister
but
the
thing
is
impossible
now
your
three
sisters
are
all
married
one
to
general
leduc
one
to
prince
bacciocchi
and
the
third
to
in
short
said
bonaparte
laughing
you
feel
easy
and
settled
in
your
mind
you
think
yourself
rid
of
my
oh
general
exclaimed
roland
you
are
not
ambitious
it
seems
general
let
me
love
you
for
all
the
good
you
have
done
to
me
and
not
for
what
you
seek
to
but
suppose
it
is
for
my
own
interests
that
i
seek
to
bind
you
to
me
not
by
the
ties
of
friendship
alone
but
also
by
those
of
matrimony
suppose
i
say
to
you
in
my
plans
for
the
future
i
can
not
rely
upon
my
two
brothers
whereas
i
could
never
for
one
instant
doubt
you
in
heart
yes
you
are
in
all
respects
what
can
i
do
with
leclerc
a
commonplace
man
with
bacciocchi
who
is
not
french
with
murat
and
and
yet
some
day
i
shall
have
to
make
princes
of
them
because
they
are
my
sisters
husbands
when
that
time
comes
what
can
i
make
of
you
a
marshal
of
and
afterward
afterward
i
should
say
that
was
and
then
you
would
be
one
of
twelve
and
not
a
unity
of
your
let
me
be
simply
your
friend
let
me
always
thresh
out
the
truth
with
you
and
then
i
ll
warrant
i
shall
be
out
of
the
that
may
be
enough
for
you
roland
but
it
is
not
enough
for
me
persisted
bonaparte
then
as
roland
said
nothing
he
continued
i
have
no
more
sisters
roland
it
is
true
but
i
have
dreamed
that
you
might
be
something
more
to
me
than
a
then
as
roland
still
said
nothing
he
went
on
i
know
a
young
girl
roland
a
charming
child
whom
i
love
as
a
daughter
she
is
just
seventeen
you
are
and
a
before
the
end
of
the
campaign
you
will
be
general
of
division
well
roland
when
the
campaign
is
over
we
will
return
together
to
paris
and
you
shall
marry
her
general
interrupted
roland
i
think
i
see
bourrienne
looking
for
and
in
fact
the
first
consul
s
secretary
was
already
within
two
feet
of
the
friends
is
that
you
bourrienne
asked
bonaparte
somewhat
impatiently
yes
general
a
courier
from
ah
and
a
letter
from
madame
good
said
the
first
consul
rising
eagerly
give
it
to
and
he
almost
snatched
the
letter
from
bourrienne
s
hand
and
for
me
asked
roland
nothing
for
me
that
is
strange
said
the
young
man
pensively
the
moon
had
risen
and
by
its
clear
beautiful
light
bonaparte
was
able
to
read
his
letters
through
the
first
two
pages
his
face
expressed
perfect
serenity
bonaparte
adored
his
wife
the
letters
published
by
queen
hortense
bear
witness
to
that
fact
roland
watched
these
expressions
of
the
soul
on
his
general
s
face
but
toward
the
close
of
the
letter
bonaparte
s
face
clouded
he
frowned
and
cast
a
furtive
glance
at
roland
ah
exclaimed
the
young
man
it
seems
there
is
something
about
me
in
the
bonaparte
did
not
answer
and
continued
to
read
when
he
had
finished
he
folded
the
letter
and
put
it
in
the
side
pocket
of
his
coat
then
turning
to
bourrienne
he
said
very
well
we
will
return
i
shall
probably
have
to
despatch
a
courier
go
mend
some
pens
while
you
are
waiting
for
bourrienne
bowed
and
returned
to
chivasso
bonaparte
then
went
up
to
roland
and
laid
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
saying
i
have
no
luck
with
the
marriages
i
attempt
to
how
so
asked
roland
your
sister
s
marriage
is
has
she
refused
no
she
has
she
has
not
can
it
be
sir
john
refused
to
marry
my
sister
after
asking
her
of
me
of
my
mother
of
you
of
herself
come
don
t
begin
to
get
angry
try
to
see
that
there
is
some
mystery
in
all
i
don
t
see
any
mystery
i
see
an
insult
ah
there
you
are
roland
that
explains
why
your
mother
and
sister
did
not
write
to
you
but
josephine
thought
the
matter
so
serious
that
you
ought
to
be
informed
she
writes
me
this
news
and
asks
me
to
tell
you
of
it
if
i
think
best
you
see
i
have
not
i
thank
you
sincerely
general
does
lord
tanlay
give
any
reason
for
this
refusal
a
reason
that
is
no
what
is
it
it
can
t
be
the
true
but
what
is
it
it
is
only
necessary
to
look
at
the
man
and
to
talk
with
him
for
five
minutes
to
understand
but
general
what
reason
does
he
give
for
breaking
his
word
that
your
sister
is
not
as
rich
as
he
thought
she
roland
burst
into
that
nervous
laugh
which
was
a
sign
with
him
of
violent
agitation
ha
said
he
that
was
the
very
first
thing
i
told
what
did
you
tell
him
that
my
sister
hadn
t
a
penny
how
can
the
children
of
republican
generals
be
rich
and
what
did
he
answer
that
he
was
rich
enough
for
you
see
therefore
that
that
was
not
the
real
reason
for
his
and
it
is
your
opinion
that
one
of
your
can
receive
such
an
insult
and
not
demand
satisfaction
in
such
situations
the
person
who
feels
affronted
must
judge
of
the
matter
for
himself
my
dear
general
how
many
days
do
you
think
it
will
be
before
we
have
a
decisive
action
bonaparte
calculated
not
less
than
fifteen
days
or
three
weeks
he
answered
then
general
i
ask
you
for
a
furlough
of
fifteen
on
one
what
is
it
that
you
will
first
go
to
bourg
and
ask
your
sister
from
which
side
the
refusal
that
is
my
in
that
case
you
have
not
a
moment
to
you
see
i
lose
none
said
the
young
man
already
on
his
way
to
the
village
one
moment
said
bonaparte
you
will
take
my
despatches
to
paris
won
t
you
ah
i
see
i
am
the
courier
you
spoke
of
just
now
to
come
wait
one
moment
the
young
men
you
arrested
the
companions
of
jehu
yes
well
it
seems
that
they
were
all
of
noble
families
they
were
fanatics
rather
than
criminals
it
appears
that
your
mother
has
been
made
the
victim
of
some
judicial
trick
or
other
in
testifying
at
their
trial
and
has
called
their
possibly
my
mother
was
in
the
coach
stopped
by
them
as
you
know
and
saw
the
face
of
their
well
your
mother
implores
me
through
josephine
to
pardon
those
poor
madmen
that
is
the
very
word
she
uses
they
have
appealed
their
case
you
will
get
there
before
the
appeal
can
be
rejected
and
if
you
think
it
desirable
tell
the
minister
of
justice
for
me
to
suspend
matters
after
you
get
back
we
can
see
what
is
best
to
be
thank
you
general
anything
more
no
said
bonaparte
except
to
think
over
our
what
was
it
about
your
chapter
lii
the
trial
well
i
ll
say
as
you
did
just
now
we
ll
talk
about
it
when
i
return
if
i
bless
me
exclaimed
bonaparte
i
m
not
afraid
you
ll
kill
him
as
you
have
the
others
only
this
time
i
must
admit
i
shall
be
sorry
to
have
him
if
you
are
going
to
feel
so
badly
about
it
general
i
can
easily
be
killed
in
his
don
t
do
anything
foolish
ninny
cried
bonaparte
hastily
i
should
feel
still
worse
if
i
lost
really
general
you
are
the
hardest
man
to
please
that
i
know
of
said
roland
with
his
harsh
laugh
and
this
time
he
took
his
way
to
chivasso
without
further
delay
half
an
hour
later
roland
was
galloping
along
the
road
to
ivrae
in
a
he
was
to
travel
thus
to
aosta
at
aosta
take
a
mule
cross
the
to
martigny
thence
to
geneva
on
to
bourg
and
from
bourg
to
paris
while
he
is
galloping
along
let
us
see
what
has
happened
in
france
and
clear
up
the
points
in
the
conversation
between
bonaparte
and
his
which
must
be
obscure
to
the
reader
s
mind
the
prisoners
which
roland
had
made
at
the
grotto
of
ceyzeriat
had
remained
but
one
night
in
the
prison
at
bourg
they
had
been
immediately
transferred
to
that
of
besançon
where
they
were
to
appear
before
a
council
of
war
it
will
be
remembered
that
two
of
these
prisoners
were
so
grievously
wounded
that
they
were
carried
into
bourg
on
stretchers
one
of
them
died
that
same
night
the
other
three
days
after
they
reached
besançon
the
number
of
prisoners
was
therefore
reduced
to
four
morgan
who
had
surrendered
himself
voluntarily
and
who
was
safe
and
sound
and
montbar
adler
and
d
assas
who
were
more
or
less
wounded
in
the
fight
though
none
of
them
dangerously
these
four
aliases
hid
as
the
reader
will
remember
the
real
names
of
the
baron
de
the
comte
de
jayat
the
vicomte
de
valensolle
and
the
marquis
de
ribier
while
the
evidence
was
being
taken
against
the
four
prisoners
before
the
military
commission
at
besançon
the
time
expired
when
under
the
law
such
cases
were
tried
by
the
prisoners
became
accountable
therefore
to
the
civil
tribunals
this
made
a
great
difference
to
them
not
only
as
to
the
penalty
if
convicted
but
in
the
mode
of
execution
condemned
by
a
they
would
be
shot
condemned
by
the
courts
they
would
be
guillotined
death
by
the
first
was
not
infamous
death
by
the
second
was
as
soon
as
it
appeared
that
their
case
was
to
be
brought
before
a
jury
it
belonged
by
law
to
the
court
of
bourg
toward
the
end
of
march
the
prisoners
were
therefore
transferred
from
the
prison
of
besançon
to
that
of
bourg
and
the
first
steps
toward
a
trial
were
taken
but
here
the
prisoners
adopted
a
line
of
defence
that
greatly
embarrassed
the
prosecuting
officers
they
declared
themselves
to
be
the
baron
de
the
comte
de
jayat
the
vicomte
de
valensolle
and
the
marquis
de
ribier
and
to
have
no
connection
with
the
pillagers
of
diligences
whose
names
were
morgan
montbar
adler
and
d
assas
they
acknowledged
having
belonged
to
armed
bands
but
these
forces
belonged
to
the
army
of
de
teyssonnet
and
were
a
ramification
of
the
army
of
brittany
intended
to
operate
in
the
east
and
the
midi
while
the
army
of
brittany
which
had
just
signed
a
peace
operated
in
the
north
they
had
waited
only
to
hear
of
cadoudal
s
surrender
to
do
likewise
and
the
despatch
of
the
breton
leader
was
no
doubt
on
its
way
to
them
when
they
were
attacked
and
captured
it
was
difficult
to
disprove
this
the
diligences
had
invariably
been
pillaged
by
masked
men
and
apart
from
madame
de
montrevel
and
sir
john
tanlay
no
one
had
ever
seen
the
faces
of
the
assailants
the
reader
will
recall
those
circumstances
sir
john
on
the
night
they
had
tried
condemned
and
stabbed
him
madame
de
montrevel
when
the
diligence
was
stopped
and
she
in
her
nervous
struggle
had
struck
off
the
mask
of
the
leader
both
had
been
summoned
before
the
preliminary
court
and
both
had
been
confronted
with
the
prisoners
but
neither
sir
john
nor
madame
de
montrevel
had
recognized
any
of
them
how
came
they
to
practice
this
deception
as
for
madame
de
montrevel
it
was
comprehensible
she
felt
a
double
gratitude
to
the
man
who
had
come
to
her
assistance
and
who
had
also
forgiven
and
even
praised
edouard
s
attack
upon
himself
but
sir
john
s
silence
was
more
difficult
to
explain
for
among
the
four
prisoners
he
must
have
recognized
at
least
two
of
his
assailants
they
had
recognized
him
and
a
certain
quiver
had
run
through
their
veins
as
they
did
so
but
their
eyes
were
none
the
less
resolutely
fixed
upon
him
when
to
their
great
astonishment
sir
john
in
spite
of
the
judge
s
insistence
had
calmly
replied
i
have
not
the
honor
of
knowing
these
amélie
we
have
not
spoken
of
her
for
there
are
sorrows
no
pen
can
depict
amélie
pale
feverish
almost
expiring
since
that
fatal
night
when
morgan
was
arrested
awaited
the
return
of
her
mother
and
sir
john
from
the
preliminary
trial
with
dreadful
anxiety
sir
john
arrived
first
madame
de
montrevel
had
remained
behind
to
give
some
orders
to
michel
as
soon
as
amélie
saw
him
she
rushed
forward
crying
out
what
happened
sir
john
looked
behind
him
to
make
sure
that
madame
de
montrevel
could
neither
see
nor
hear
him
then
he
said
your
mother
and
i
recognized
no
ah
how
noble
you
are
i
how
generous
how
good
my
lord
cried
the
young
girl
trying
to
kiss
his
hand
but
he
withdrawing
his
hand
said
hastily
i
have
only
done
as
i
promised
you
but
hush
here
is
your
amélie
stepped
back
ah
mamma
she
said
so
you
did
not
say
anything
to
compromise
those
unfortunate
men
what
replied
madame
de
montrevel
would
you
have
me
send
to
the
scaffold
a
man
who
had
helped
me
and
who
instead
of
punishing
edouard
kissed
him
and
yet
said
amélie
trembling
you
recognized
him
did
you
not
perfectly
replied
madame
de
montrevel
he
is
the
fair
man
with
the
black
eyebrows
who
calls
himself
the
baron
de
amélie
gave
a
stifled
cry
then
making
an
effort
to
control
herself
she
said
is
that
the
end
of
it
for
sir
john
and
you
will
you
be
called
to
testify
again
probably
not
replied
madame
de
montrevel
in
any
case
observed
sir
john
as
neither
your
mother
nor
i
recognized
any
one
she
will
persist
in
that
oh
most
certainly
exclaimed
madame
de
montrevel
god
keep
me
from
causing
the
death
of
that
unhappy
young
man
i
should
never
forgive
myself
it
is
bad
enough
that
roland
should
have
been
the
one
to
capture
him
and
his
amélie
sighed
but
nevertheless
her
face
assumed
a
calmer
expression
she
looked
gratefully
at
sir
john
and
then
went
up
to
her
room
where
charlotte
was
waiting
for
her
charlotte
had
become
more
than
a
maid
she
was
now
amélie
s
friend
every
day
since
the
four
young
men
had
returned
to
the
prison
at
bourg
she
had
gone
there
to
see
her
father
for
an
hour
or
so
during
these
visits
nothing
was
talked
of
but
the
prisoners
whom
the
worthy
jailer
royalist
as
he
was
pitied
with
all
his
heart
charlotte
made
him
tell
her
everything
even
to
their
slightest
words
and
later
reported
all
to
amélie
matters
stood
thus
when
madame
de
montrevel
and
sir
john
arrived
at
before
leaving
paris
the
first
consul
had
informed
madame
de
montrevel
both
through
josephine
and
roland
that
he
approved
of
her
daughter
s
marriage
and
wished
it
to
take
place
during
his
absence
and
as
soon
as
possible
sir
john
had
declared
to
her
that
his
most
ardent
wishes
were
for
this
union
and
that
he
only
awaited
amélie
s
commands
to
become
the
happiest
of
men
matters
having
reached
this
point
madame
de
montrevel
on
the
morning
of
the
day
on
which
she
and
sir
john
were
to
give
their
testimony
had
arranged
a
private
interview
between
her
daughter
and
sir
john
the
interview
lasted
over
an
hour
and
sir
john
did
not
leave
amélie
until
the
carriage
came
to
the
door
which
was
to
take
madame
de
montrevel
and
himself
to
the
court
we
have
seen
that
his
deposition
was
all
in
the
prisoners
favor
and
we
have
also
seen
how
amélie
received
him
on
his
return
that
evening
madame
de
montrevel
had
a
long
conversation
with
her
daughter
to
her
mother
s
pressing
inquiries
amélie
merely
replied
that
the
state
of
her
health
was
such
that
she
desired
a
postponement
of
her
marriage
and
that
she
counted
on
sir
john
s
delicacy
to
grant
it
the
next
day
madame
de
montrevel
was
obliged
to
return
to
paris
her
position
in
madame
bonaparte
s
household
not
admitting
of
longer
absence
the
morning
of
her
departure
she
urged
amélie
to
accompany
her
but
again
the
young
girl
dwelt
upon
the
feebleness
of
her
health
the
sweetest
and
most
reviving
months
in
the
year
were
just
opening
and
she
begged
to
be
allowed
to
spend
then
in
the
country
for
they
were
sure
she
said
to
do
her
good
madame
de
montrevel
always
unable
to
deny
amélie
anything
above
all
where
it
concerned
her
health
granted
her
request
on
her
return
to
paris
madame
de
montrevel
travelled
as
before
with
sir
john
much
to
her
surprise
during
the
two
days
journey
he
did
not
say
anything
to
her
about
his
marriage
to
amélie
but
madame
bonaparte
as
soon
as
she
saw
her
friend
asked
the
usual
question
well
when
shall
we
marry
amélie
and
sir
john
you
know
how
much
the
first
consul
desires
to
which
madame
de
montrevel
replied
it
all
depends
on
sir
this
response
furnished
madame
bonaparte
with
much
food
for
reflection
why
should
a
man
who
had
been
so
eager
suddenly
grow
cold
time
alone
could
explain
the
mystery
time
went
by
and
the
trial
of
the
prisoners
began
they
were
confronted
with
all
the
travellers
who
had
signed
the
various
depositions
which
as
we
have
seen
were
in
the
possession
of
the
minister
of
police
no
one
had
recognized
them
for
no
one
had
seen
their
faces
uncovered
moreover
the
travellers
asserted
that
none
of
their
property
either
money
or
jewels
had
been
taken
jean
picot
testified
that
the
two
hundred
louis
which
had
been
taken
from
him
by
accident
had
been
returned
these
preliminary
inquiries
lasted
over
two
months
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
accused
against
whom
there
was
no
evidence
connecting
them
with
the
pillage
of
the
coaches
were
under
no
accusation
but
that
of
their
own
admissions
that
is
to
say
of
being
affiliated
with
the
breton
and
vendéan
insurrection
they
were
simply
one
of
the
armed
bands
roaming
the
jura
under
the
orders
of
de
teyssonnet
the
judges
delayed
the
final
trial
as
long
as
possible
hoping
that
some
more
direct
testimony
might
be
discovered
this
hope
was
balked
no
one
had
really
suffered
from
the
deeds
imputed
to
these
young
men
except
the
treasury
whose
misfortunes
concerned
no
one
the
trial
could
not
be
delayed
any
longer
the
prisoners
on
their
side
had
made
the
best
of
their
time
by
means
as
we
have
seen
of
an
exchange
of
passports
morgan
had
travelled
sometimes
as
ribier
and
ribier
as
and
so
with
the
others
the
result
was
a
confusion
in
the
testimony
of
the
innkeepers
which
the
entries
in
their
books
only
served
to
increase
the
arrival
of
travellers
noted
on
the
registers
an
hour
too
early
or
an
hour
too
late
furnished
the
prisoners
with
irrefutable
alibis
the
judges
were
morally
convinced
of
their
guilt
but
their
conviction
was
impossible
against
such
testimony
on
the
other
hand
it
must
be
said
that
public
sympathy
was
wholly
with
the
prisoners
the
trial
began
the
prison
at
bourg
adjoins
the
courtroom
the
prisoners
could
be
brought
there
through
the
interior
passages
large
as
the
hall
was
it
was
crowded
on
the
opening
day
the
whole
population
of
bourg
thronged
about
the
doors
and
persons
came
from
mâcon
besançon
and
nantua
so
great
was
the
excitement
caused
by
the
stoppages
and
so
popular
were
the
exploits
of
the
companions
of
jehu
the
entrance
of
the
four
prisoners
was
greeted
by
a
murmur
in
which
there
was
nothing
offensive
public
sentiment
seemed
equally
divided
between
curiosity
and
sympathy
their
presence
it
must
be
admitted
was
well
calculated
to
inspire
both
very
handsome
dressed
in
the
latest
fashion
of
the
day
without
insolence
smiling
toward
the
audience
courteous
to
their
judges
though
at
times
a
little
sarcastic
their
personal
appearance
was
their
best
defence
the
oldest
of
the
four
was
barely
thirty
questioned
as
to
their
names
christian
and
family
their
age
and
places
of
birth
they
answered
as
follows
charles
de
born
at
tours
department
of
the
aged
de
jayat
born
at
department
of
the
ain
aged
de
valensolle
born
at
department
of
the
rhone
aged
de
ribier
born
at
bollène
department
of
vaucluse
aged
questioned
as
to
their
social
condition
and
state
all
four
said
they
were
of
noble
rank
and
royalists
these
fine
young
men
defending
themselves
against
death
on
the
scaffold
not
against
a
soldier
s
death
before
the
guns
who
asked
the
death
they
claimed
to
have
merited
as
insurrectionists
but
a
death
of
honor
formed
a
splendid
spectacle
of
youth
courage
and
gallant
bearing
the
judges
saw
plainly
that
on
the
accusation
of
being
insurrectionists
the
vendée
having
submitted
and
brittany
being
pacificated
they
would
have
to
be
acquitted
that
was
not
a
result
to
satisfy
the
minister
of
police
death
awarded
by
a
council
of
war
would
not
have
satisfied
him
he
had
determined
that
these
men
should
die
the
death
of
malefactors
a
death
of
infamy
the
trial
had
now
lasted
three
days
without
proceeding
in
the
direction
of
the
minister
s
wishes
charlotte
who
could
reach
the
courtroom
through
the
prison
was
there
each
day
and
returned
each
night
to
amélie
with
some
fresh
word
of
hope
on
the
fourth
day
amélie
could
bear
the
suspense
no
longer
she
dressed
herself
in
a
costume
similar
to
the
one
that
charlotte
wore
except
that
the
black
lace
of
the
was
longer
and
thicker
than
is
usual
with
the
bressan
peasant
woman
it
formed
a
veil
and
completely
hid
her
features
charlotte
presented
amélie
to
her
father
as
one
of
her
friends
who
was
anxious
to
see
the
trial
the
good
man
did
not
recognize
mademoiselle
de
montrevel
and
in
order
to
enable
the
young
girls
to
see
the
prisoners
well
he
placed
them
in
the
doorway
of
the
porter
s
room
which
opened
upon
the
passage
leading
to
the
courtroom
this
passage
was
so
narrow
at
this
particular
point
that
the
four
gendarmes
who
accompanied
the
prisoners
changed
the
line
of
march
first
came
two
officers
then
the
prisoners
one
by
one
then
the
other
two
officers
the
girls
stood
in
the
doorway
when
amélie
heard
the
doors
open
she
was
obliged
to
lean
upon
charlotte
s
shoulder
for
support
the
earth
seemed
to
give
way
under
her
feet
and
the
wall
at
her
back
she
heard
the
sound
of
feet
and
the
rattle
of
the
gendarmes
sabres
then
the
door
of
the
prison
opened
first
one
gendarme
appeared
then
another
then
walking
first
as
though
he
were
still
morgan
the
captain
of
the
companions
of
jehu
as
he
passed
amélie
murmured
charles
the
prisoner
recognized
the
beloved
voice
gave
a
faint
cry
and
felt
a
paper
slip
into
his
hand
he
pressed
that
precious
hand
murmured
her
name
and
passed
on
the
others
who
followed
did
not
or
pretended
not
to
notice
the
two
girls
as
for
the
gendarmes
they
had
seen
and
heard
nothing
as
soon
as
the
party
stepped
into
the
light
morgan
unfolded
the
note
and
read
as
follows
do
not
be
anxious
my
beloved
charles
i
am
and
ever
will
be
your
faithful
amélie
in
life
or
death
i
have
told
all
to
lord
tanlay
he
is
the
most
generous
man
on
earth
he
has
promised
me
to
break
off
the
marriage
and
to
take
the
whole
responsibility
on
himself
i
love
you
morgan
kissed
the
note
and
put
it
in
his
breast
then
he
glanced
down
the
corridor
and
saw
the
two
bressan
women
leaning
against
the
door
amélie
had
risked
all
to
see
him
once
more
it
is
true
however
that
at
this
last
session
of
the
court
no
additional
witnesses
were
expected
who
could
injure
the
accused
and
in
the
absence
of
proof
it
was
impossible
to
convict
them
the
best
lawyers
in
the
department
those
of
lyons
and
besançon
had
been
retained
by
the
prisoners
for
their
defence
each
had
spoken
in
turn
destroying
bit
by
bit
the
indictment
as
in
the
tournaments
of
the
middle
ages
a
strong
and
dexterous
knight
was
wont
to
knock
off
piece
by
piece
his
adversary
s
armor
flattering
applause
had
followed
the
more
remarkable
points
of
their
arguments
in
spite
of
the
usher
s
warnings
and
the
admonitions
of
the
judge
amélie
with
clasped
hands
was
thanking
god
who
had
so
visibly
manifested
himself
in
the
prisoners
favor
a
dreadful
weight
was
lifted
from
her
tortured
breast
she
breathed
with
joy
and
looked
through
tears
of
gratitude
at
the
christ
which
hung
above
the
judge
s
head
the
arguments
were
all
made
and
the
case
about
to
be
closed
suddenly
an
usher
entered
the
courtroom
approached
the
judge
and
whispered
something
in
his
ear
gentlemen
said
the
judge
the
court
is
adjourned
for
a
time
let
the
prisoners
be
taken
there
was
a
movement
of
feverish
anxiety
among
the
audience
what
could
have
happened
what
unexpected
event
was
about
to
take
place
every
one
looked
anxiously
at
his
neighbor
amélie
s
heart
was
wrung
by
a
presentiment
she
pressed
her
hand
to
her
breast
it
was
as
though
an
iron
had
pierced
it
to
the
springs
of
life
the
gendarmes
rose
the
prisoners
did
likewise
and
were
then
marched
back
to
their
cells
one
after
the
other
they
passed
amélie
the
hands
of
the
lovers
touched
each
other
those
of
amélie
were
as
cold
as
death
whatever
happens
thank
you
said
charles
as
he
passed
amélie
tried
to
answer
but
the
words
died
on
her
lips
during
this
time
the
judge
had
risen
and
passed
into
the
there
he
found
a
veiled
woman
who
had
just
descended
from
a
carriage
at
the
door
of
the
courthouse
and
had
not
spoken
to
any
one
on
her
way
in
madame
said
the
judge
i
offer
you
many
excuses
for
the
way
in
which
i
have
brought
you
from
paris
but
the
life
of
a
man
depends
upon
it
and
before
that
consideration
everything
must
you
have
no
need
to
excuse
yourself
sir
replied
the
veiled
lady
i
know
the
prerogatives
of
the
law
and
i
am
here
at
your
madame
said
the
judge
the
court
and
myself
recognize
the
feeling
of
delicacy
which
prompted
you
when
first
confronted
with
the
prisoners
to
decline
to
recognize
the
one
who
assisted
you
when
fainting
at
that
time
the
prisoners
denied
their
identity
with
the
pillagers
of
the
diligences
since
then
they
have
confessed
all
but
it
is
our
wish
to
know
the
one
who
showed
you
that
consideration
in
order
that
we
may
recommend
him
to
the
first
consul
s
what
exclaimed
the
lady
have
they
really
confessed
yes
madame
but
they
will
not
say
which
of
their
number
helped
you
fearing
no
doubt
to
contradict
your
testimony
and
thus
cause
you
what
is
it
you
request
of
me
sir
that
you
will
save
the
gentleman
who
assisted
oh
willingly
said
the
lady
rising
what
am
i
to
do
answer
a
question
which
i
shall
ask
i
am
ready
wait
here
a
moment
you
will
be
sent
for
the
judge
went
back
into
the
courtroom
a
gendarme
was
placed
at
each
door
to
prevent
any
one
from
approaching
the
lady
the
judge
resumed
his
seat
gentlemen
said
he
the
session
is
general
excitement
prevailed
the
ushers
called
for
silence
and
silence
was
restored
bring
in
the
witness
said
the
judge
an
usher
opened
the
door
of
the
and
the
lady
still
veiled
was
brought
into
court
all
eyes
turned
upon
her
who
was
she
why
was
she
there
what
had
she
come
for
amélie
s
eyes
fastened
upon
her
at
once
o
my
god
she
murmured
grant
that
i
be
madame
said
the
judge
the
prisoners
are
about
to
be
brought
in
have
the
goodness
to
point
out
the
one
who
when
the
geneva
diligence
was
stopped
paid
you
those
a
shudder
ran
through
the
audience
they
felt
that
some
fatal
trap
had
been
laid
for
the
prisoners
a
dozen
voices
began
to
shout
say
nothing
but
the
ushers
at
a
sign
from
the
judge
cried
out
imperatively
silence
amélie
s
heart
turned
deadly
cold
a
cold
sweat
poured
from
her
forehead
her
knees
gave
way
and
trembled
under
her
bring
in
the
prisoners
said
the
judge
imposing
silence
by
a
look
as
the
usher
had
with
his
voice
and
you
madame
have
the
goodness
to
advance
and
raise
your
the
veiled
lady
obeyed
my
mother
cried
amélie
but
in
a
voice
so
choked
that
only
those
near
her
heard
the
words
madame
de
montrevel
murmured
the
audience
at
that
moment
the
first
gendarme
appeared
at
the
door
then
the
second
after
him
came
the
prisoners
but
not
in
the
same
order
as
before
morgan
had
placed
himself
third
so
that
separated
as
he
was
from
the
gendarmes
by
montbar
and
adler
in
front
and
d
assas
behind
he
might
be
better
able
to
clasp
amélie
s
hand
montbar
entered
first
madame
de
montrevel
shook
her
head
then
came
adler
madame
de
montrevel
made
the
same
negative
sign
just
then
morgan
passed
before
amélie
we
are
lost
she
said
he
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
as
she
pressed
his
hand
convulsively
then
he
entered
that
is
he
said
madame
de
montrevel
as
soon
as
she
saw
morgan
or
if
the
reader
prefers
it
baron
charles
de
who
was
now
proved
one
and
the
same
man
by
means
of
madame
de
montrevel
s
identification
a
long
cry
of
distress
burst
from
the
audience
montbar
burst
into
a
laugh
ha
by
my
faith
he
cried
that
will
teach
you
dear
friend
to
play
the
gallant
with
fainting
then
turning
to
madame
de
montrevel
he
added
with
three
short
words
madame
you
have
decapitated
four
a
terrible
silence
fell
in
the
midst
of
which
a
groan
was
heard
usher
said
the
judge
have
you
warned
the
public
that
all
marks
of
approbation
or
disapproval
are
forbidden
the
usher
inquired
who
had
disobeyed
the
order
of
the
court
it
was
a
woman
wearing
the
dress
of
a
bressan
peasant
who
was
being
carried
into
the
jailer
s
room
from
that
moment
the
accused
made
no
further
attempt
at
denial
but
just
as
morgan
had
united
with
them
when
arrested
they
now
joined
with
him
their
four
heads
should
be
saved
or
fall
together
that
same
day
at
ten
in
the
evening
the
jury
rendered
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
the
court
pronounced
the
sentence
of
death
three
days
later
by
force
of
entreaties
the
lawyers
obtained
permission
for
the
accused
to
appeal
their
case
but
they
were
not
admitted
to
bail
chapter
liii
in
which
amélie
keeps
her
word
the
verdict
rendered
by
the
jury
of
the
town
of
bourg
had
a
terrible
effect
not
only
in
the
courtroom
but
throughout
the
entire
town
the
four
prisoners
had
shown
such
chivalric
brotherhood
such
noble
bearing
such
deep
conviction
in
the
faith
they
professed
that
their
enemies
themselves
admired
the
devotion
which
had
made
robbers
and
highwaymen
of
men
of
rank
and
family
madame
de
montrevel
overwhelmed
by
the
part
she
had
been
made
to
play
at
the
crucial
point
of
this
drama
saw
but
one
means
of
repairing
the
evil
she
had
done
and
that
was
to
start
at
once
for
paris
and
fling
herself
at
the
feet
of
the
first
consul
imploring
him
to
pardon
the
four
condemned
men
she
did
not
even
take
time
to
go
to
the
château
des
to
see
amélie
she
knew
that
bonaparte
s
departure
was
fixed
for
the
first
week
in
may
and
this
was
already
the
when
she
last
left
paris
everything
had
been
prepared
for
that
departure
she
wrote
a
line
to
amélie
explaining
by
what
fatal
deception
she
had
been
instrumental
in
destroying
the
lives
of
four
men
when
she
intended
to
save
the
life
of
one
then
as
if
ashamed
of
having
broken
the
pledge
she
had
made
to
amélie
and
above
all
to
herself
she
ordered
fresh
and
returned
to
paris
she
arrived
there
on
the
morning
of
the
of
may
bonaparte
had
started
on
the
evening
of
the
he
said
on
leaving
that
he
was
only
going
to
dijon
possibly
as
far
as
geneva
but
in
any
case
he
should
not
be
absent
more
than
three
weeks
the
prisoners
appeal
even
if
rejected
would
not
receive
final
consideration
for
five
or
six
weeks
all
hope
need
not
therefore
be
abandoned
but
alas
it
became
evident
that
the
review
at
dijon
was
only
a
pretext
that
the
journey
to
geneva
had
never
been
seriously
thought
of
and
that
bonaparte
instead
of
going
to
switzerland
was
really
on
his
way
to
italy
then
madame
de
montrevel
unwilling
to
appeal
to
her
son
for
she
had
heard
his
oath
when
lord
tanlay
had
been
left
for
dead
and
knew
the
part
he
had
played
in
the
capture
of
the
companions
of
jehu
then
madame
de
montrevel
appealed
to
josephine
and
josephine
promised
to
write
to
the
first
consul
that
same
evening
she
kept
her
promise
but
the
trial
had
made
a
great
stir
it
was
not
with
these
prisoners
as
with
ordinary
men
justice
made
haste
and
days
after
the
verdict
had
been
rendered
the
appeal
was
rejected
this
decision
was
immediately
sent
to
bourg
with
an
order
to
execute
the
prisoners
within
hours
but
notwithstanding
the
haste
of
the
minister
of
police
in
forwarding
this
decision
the
first
intimation
of
the
fatal
news
was
not
received
by
the
judicial
authorities
at
bourg
while
the
prisoners
were
taking
their
daily
walk
in
the
courtyard
a
stone
was
thrown
over
the
outer
wall
and
fell
at
their
feet
morgan
who
still
retained
in
relation
to
his
comrades
the
position
of
leader
picked
it
up
opened
the
letter
which
inclosed
the
stone
and
read
it
then
turning
to
his
friends
he
said
gentlemen
the
appeal
has
been
rejected
as
we
might
have
expected
and
the
ceremony
will
take
place
in
all
probability
valensolle
and
ribier
who
were
playing
a
species
of
quoits
with
and
louis
left
off
their
game
to
hear
the
news
having
heard
it
they
returned
to
their
game
without
remark
jayat
who
was
reading
la
nouvelle
héloise
resumed
his
book
saying
then
i
shall
not
have
time
to
finish
rousseau
s
masterpiece
and
upon
my
word
i
don
t
regret
it
for
it
is
the
most
utterly
false
and
wearisome
book
i
ever
read
in
my
life
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
murmuring
poor
amélie
then
observing
charlotte
who
was
at
the
window
of
the
jailer
s
room
overlooking
the
courtyard
he
went
to
her
tell
amélie
that
she
must
keep
the
promise
she
made
me
the
jailer
s
daughter
closed
the
window
kissed
her
father
and
told
him
that
in
all
probability
he
would
see
her
there
again
that
evening
then
she
returned
to
a
road
she
had
taken
twice
every
day
for
the
last
two
months
once
at
noon
on
her
way
to
the
prison
once
in
the
evening
on
returning
to
the
château
every
night
she
found
amélie
in
the
same
place
sitting
at
the
window
which
in
happier
days
had
given
admittance
to
her
beloved
charles
since
the
day
she
had
fainted
in
the
courtroom
she
had
shed
no
tears
and
we
may
almost
add
had
uttered
no
word
unlike
the
marble
of
antiquity
awakening
into
life
she
might
have
been
compared
to
a
living
woman
petrifying
into
stone
every
day
she
grew
paler
charlotte
watched
her
with
astonishment
common
minds
always
impressed
by
noisy
demonstrations
that
is
to
say
by
cries
and
tears
are
unable
to
understand
a
mute
sorrow
dumbness
to
them
means
indifference
she
was
therefore
astonished
at
the
calmness
with
which
amélie
received
the
message
she
was
charged
to
deliver
she
did
not
see
in
the
dimness
of
the
twilight
that
amélie
s
face
from
being
pale
grew
livid
she
did
not
feel
the
deadly
clutch
which
like
an
iron
wrench
had
seized
her
heart
she
did
not
know
that
as
her
mistress
walked
to
the
door
an
automatic
stiffness
was
in
her
limbs
nevertheless
she
followed
her
anxiously
but
at
the
door
amélie
stretched
out
her
hand
wait
for
me
there
she
said
charlotte
obeyed
amélie
closed
the
door
behind
her
and
went
up
to
roland
s
room
roland
s
room
was
veritably
that
of
a
soldier
and
a
huntsman
and
its
chief
adornments
were
trophies
and
weapons
arms
of
all
kinds
were
here
french
and
foreign
from
the
pistol
of
versailles
to
the
pistol
of
cairo
from
the
tempered
blade
of
catalonia
to
the
turkish
cimeter
amélie
took
down
from
this
arsenal
four
daggers
and
pointed
and
eight
pistols
of
different
shapes
she
put
balls
in
a
bag
and
powder
in
a
horn
thus
supplied
she
returned
to
her
own
room
there
charlotte
assisted
her
in
putting
on
the
peasant
gown
then
she
waited
for
the
night
night
comes
late
in
june
amélie
stood
motionless
mute
leaning
against
the
and
looking
through
the
open
window
at
the
village
of
ceyzeriat
which
was
slowly
disappearing
in
the
gathering
shades
of
night
when
she
could
no
longer
distinguish
anything
but
the
lights
which
were
being
lighted
one
by
one
she
said
come
it
is
time
to
the
two
young
girls
went
out
michel
paid
no
attention
to
amélie
supposing
her
to
be
some
friend
of
charlotte
s
who
had
called
to
see
her
and
whom
the
jailer
s
daughter
was
now
escorting
home
ten
o
clock
was
striking
as
they
passed
the
church
of
brou
it
was
quarter
past
when
charlotte
knocked
at
the
prison
door
old
courtois
opened
it
we
have
already
shown
the
political
opinions
of
the
worthy
jailer
he
was
a
royalist
he
therefore
felt
the
deepest
sympathy
for
the
four
condemned
men
and
had
hoped
like
nearly
every
one
in
bourg
like
madame
de
montrevel
whose
despair
at
what
she
had
done
was
known
to
him
that
the
first
consul
would
pardon
them
he
had
therefore
mitigated
their
captivity
as
much
as
possible
without
failing
in
his
duty
by
relieving
them
of
all
needless
restrictions
on
the
other
hand
it
is
true
that
he
had
refused
a
gift
of
sixty
thousand
francs
a
sum
which
in
those
days
was
worth
nearly
treble
what
it
is
now
to
allow
them
to
escape
we
have
seen
how
being
taken
into
confidence
by
his
daughter
he
had
allowed
amélie
disguised
as
a
bressan
peasant
to
be
present
at
the
trial
the
reader
will
also
remember
the
kindness
the
worthy
man
had
shown
to
amélie
and
her
mother
when
they
themselves
were
prisoners
this
time
as
he
was
still
ignorant
of
the
rejection
of
the
appeal
he
allowed
his
feelings
to
be
worked
upon
charlotte
had
told
him
that
her
young
mistress
was
to
start
that
night
for
paris
to
endeavor
to
hasten
the
pardon
and
that
she
desired
before
leaving
to
see
the
baron
de
and
obtain
his
last
instructions
there
were
five
doors
to
break
through
to
reach
the
street
a
squad
of
guards
in
the
courtyard
and
sentinels
within
and
without
the
prison
consequently
père
courtois
felt
no
anxiety
lest
his
prisoners
escape
he
therefore
consented
that
amélie
should
see
morgan
we
trust
our
readers
will
excuse
us
if
we
use
the
names
morgan
charles
and
the
baron
de
interchangeably
since
they
are
aware
that
by
that
triple
appellation
we
intend
to
designate
the
same
man
courtois
took
a
light
and
walked
before
amélie
the
young
girl
as
though
prepared
to
start
by
the
at
once
on
leaving
the
prison
carried
a
travelling
bag
in
her
hand
charlotte
followed
her
mistress
you
will
recognize
the
cell
mademoiselle
de
montrevel
said
courtois
it
is
the
one
in
which
you
were
confined
with
your
mother
the
leader
of
these
unfortunate
young
men
the
baron
charles
de
asked
me
as
a
favor
to
put
them
in
cage
no
you
know
that
s
the
name
we
give
our
cells
i
did
not
think
i
ought
to
refuse
him
that
consolation
knowing
how
the
poor
fellow
loved
you
oh
don
t
be
uneasy
mademoiselle
amélie
i
will
never
breathe
your
secret
then
he
questioned
me
asking
which
had
been
your
mother
s
bed
and
which
yours
i
told
him
and
then
he
wanted
his
to
stand
just
where
yours
did
that
wasn
t
hard
for
the
bed
was
not
only
in
the
same
place
but
it
was
the
very
one
you
had
used
so
since
the
poor
fellow
entered
your
cell
he
has
spent
nearly
all
his
time
lying
on
your
amélie
gave
a
sigh
that
resembled
a
groan
she
felt
and
it
was
long
since
she
had
done
so
a
tear
moisten
her
eyelids
yes
she
was
loved
as
she
loved
and
the
lips
of
a
disinterested
stranger
gave
her
the
proof
of
it
at
this
moment
of
eternal
separation
this
conviction
shone
like
a
diamond
of
light
in
its
setting
of
sorrow
the
doors
opened
one
by
one
before
père
courtois
when
they
reached
the
last
one
amélie
laid
her
hand
on
the
jailer
s
shoulder
she
thought
she
heard
a
chant
listening
attentively
she
became
aware
that
it
was
a
voice
repeating
verses
but
the
voice
was
not
morgan
s
it
was
unknown
to
her
here
is
what
it
said
i
have
bared
all
my
heart
to
the
god
of
the
just
he
has
witnessed
my
penitent
tears
he
has
stilled
my
remorse
he
has
armed
me
with
trust
he
has
pitied
and
calmed
all
my
fears
my
enemies
scoffing
have
said
in
their
rage
let
him
die
be
his
mem
ry
accursed
saith
the
merciful
father
my
grief
to
assuage
their
hatred
hath
now
done
its
worst
i
have
heard
thy
complaints
and
i
know
that
the
ban
of
remorse
hath
e
en
brought
thee
so
low
i
can
pity
the
soul
of
the
penitent
man
that
was
weak
in
this
valley
of
woe
i
will
crown
thy
lost
name
with
the
just
acclaim
of
the
righteous
years
their
pity
and
justice
in
time
shall
proclaim
thine
honor
then
layoff
thy
fears
i
bless
thee
o
god
who
hast
deigned
to
restore
mine
honor
that
thou
hast
made
whole
from
shame
and
remorse
as
i
enter
death
s
door
to
thee
i
commend
my
poor
soul
to
the
banquet
of
life
an
unfortunate
guest
i
came
for
a
day
and
i
go
i
die
in
my
vigor
i
sought
not
to
rest
in
the
grave
where
the
weary
lie
low
farewell
to
thee
earth
farewell
tender
verdure
of
woodland
farewell
sunny
shore
green
fields
that
i
love
azure
skies
smiling
nature
farewell
i
shall
see
thee
no
more
may
thy
beauty
still
gladden
the
friends
that
i
love
whom
i
long
for
but
stern
fate
denies
may
they
pass
full
of
years
though
i
wait
them
above
may
a
last
loving
hand
close
their
eyes
the
voice
was
silent
no
doubt
the
last
verse
was
finished
amélie
who
would
not
interrupt
the
last
meditations
of
the
doomed
men
and
who
had
recognized
gilbert
s
beautiful
ode
written
on
a
hospital
bed
the
night
before
his
death
now
signed
to
the
jailer
to
open
the
door
père
courtois
jailer
as
he
was
seemed
to
share
the
young
girl
s
emotion
for
he
put
the
key
in
the
lock
and
turned
it
as
softly
as
he
could
the
door
opened
amélie
saw
at
a
glance
the
whole
interior
of
the
cell
and
the
persons
in
it
valensolle
was
standing
leaning
against
the
wall
and
still
holding
the
book
from
which
he
had
just
read
the
lines
that
amélie
had
overheard
jayat
was
seated
near
a
table
with
his
head
resting
on
his
hands
ribier
was
sitting
on
the
table
itself
near
him
but
further
back
his
eyes
closed
as
if
in
sleep
was
lying
on
the
bed
at
sight
of
the
young
girl
whom
they
knew
to
be
amélie
ribier
and
jayat
rose
morgan
did
not
move
he
had
heard
nothing
amélie
went
directly
to
him
and
as
if
the
love
she
felt
for
him
were
sanctified
by
the
nearness
of
death
she
gave
no
heed
to
the
presence
of
his
friends
but
pressed
her
lips
to
his
murmuring
awake
my
charles
it
is
i
amélie
i
have
come
to
keep
my
morgan
gave
a
cry
of
joy
and
clasped
her
in
his
arms
monsieur
courtois
said
montbar
you
are
a
worthy
man
leave
those
poor
young
people
alone
it
would
be
sacrilege
to
trouble
their
last
moments
together
on
earth
by
our
père
courtois
without
a
word
opened
the
door
of
the
adjoining
cell
valensolle
jayat
and
ribier
entered
it
and
the
door
was
closed
upon
them
then
making
a
sign
to
charlotte
courtois
himself
went
away
the
lovers
were
alone
there
are
scenes
that
should
not
be
described
words
that
must
not
be
repeated
god
who
sees
and
hears
them
from
his
immortal
throne
alone
knows
what
sombre
joys
what
bitter
pleasures
they
contain
at
the
end
of
an
hour
the
two
young
people
heard
the
key
turn
once
more
in
the
lock
they
were
sad
but
calm
the
conviction
that
their
separation
would
not
be
for
long
gave
them
a
sweet
serenity
the
worthy
jailer
seemed
more
grieved
and
distressed
at
his
second
appearance
than
at
his
first
but
morgan
and
amélie
thanked
him
with
a
smile
he
went
to
the
cell
where
the
others
were
locked
up
and
opened
it
murmuring
to
himself
faith
it
would
have
been
hard
if
they
couldn
t
have
been
alone
together
on
their
last
valensolle
jayat
and
ribier
returned
amélie
with
her
left
arm
wound
around
morgan
held
out
her
right
hand
to
them
all
three
one
after
the
other
kissed
that
cold
damp
hand
then
morgan
led
her
to
the
door
au
revoir
he
said
soon
she
answered
and
then
this
parting
at
the
gates
of
death
was
sealed
by
a
long
kiss
followed
by
a
groan
so
terrible
that
it
seemed
to
rend
their
hearts
in
twain
the
door
closed
again
the
bolts
and
bars
shot
into
their
places
well
cried
valensolle
jayat
and
ribier
with
one
accord
here
replied
morgan
emptying
the
travelling
bag
upon
the
table
the
three
young
men
gave
a
cry
of
joy
as
they
saw
the
shining
pistols
and
gleaming
blades
it
was
all
that
they
desired
next
to
liberty
the
joy
the
dolorous
precious
joy
of
knowing
themselves
masters
of
their
own
lives
and
if
need
be
that
of
others
during
this
time
the
jailer
led
amélie
to
the
street
when
they
reached
it
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
he
touched
amélie
s
arm
saying
as
he
did
so
mademoiselle
de
montrevel
forgive
me
for
causing
you
so
much
pain
but
it
is
useless
for
you
to
go
to
because
the
appeal
has
been
rejected
and
the
execution
takes
place
i
suppose
you
mean
said
amélie
the
jailer
in
his
astonishment
stepped
back
a
pace
i
knew
it
my
friend
said
amélie
then
turning
to
charlotte
she
said
take
me
to
the
nearest
church
and
come
for
me
after
all
is
the
nearest
church
was
not
far
off
it
was
that
of
for
the
last
three
months
it
had
been
opened
for
public
worship
under
the
decree
of
the
first
consul
as
it
was
now
nearly
midnight
the
doors
were
closed
but
charlotte
knew
where
the
sexton
lived
and
she
went
to
wake
him
amélie
waited
leaning
against
the
walls
as
motionless
as
the
marble
figures
that
adorned
its
frontal
the
sexton
arrived
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
during
that
time
the
girl
had
seen
a
dreadful
sight
three
men
had
passed
her
dragging
a
cart
which
she
saw
by
the
light
of
the
moon
was
painted
red
within
this
cart
she
perceived
shapeless
objects
long
planks
and
singular
ladders
all
painted
the
same
color
they
were
dragging
it
toward
the
bastion
montrevel
the
place
used
for
the
executions
amélie
divined
what
it
was
and
with
a
cry
she
fell
upon
her
knees
at
that
cry
the
men
in
black
turned
round
they
fancied
for
a
moment
that
one
of
the
sculptured
figures
of
the
porch
had
descended
from
its
niche
and
was
kneeling
there
the
one
who
seemed
to
be
the
leader
stepped
close
to
the
young
girl
don
t
come
near
me
she
cried
don
t
come
near
me
the
man
returned
humbly
to
his
place
and
continued
on
his
way
the
cart
disappeared
round
the
corner
of
the
rue
des
prisons
but
the
noise
of
its
wheels
still
sounded
on
the
stones
and
echoed
in
the
girl
s
heart
when
the
sacristan
and
charlotte
returned
they
found
the
young
girl
on
her
knees
the
man
raised
some
objections
against
opening
the
church
at
that
hour
of
the
night
but
a
piece
of
gold
and
mademoiselle
de
montrevel
s
name
dispelled
his
scruples
a
second
gold
piece
decided
him
to
light
a
little
chapel
it
was
the
one
in
which
amélie
had
made
her
first
communion
there
kneeling
before
the
altar
she
implored
them
to
leave
her
alone
toward
three
in
the
morning
she
saw
the
colored
window
above
the
altar
of
the
virgin
begin
to
lighten
it
looked
to
the
east
so
that
the
first
ray
of
light
came
direct
to
her
eyes
as
a
messenger
from
god
little
by
little
the
town
awoke
to
amélie
the
noise
seemed
louder
than
ever
before
soon
the
vaulted
ceiling
of
the
church
shook
with
the
tramp
of
a
troop
of
horsemen
this
troop
was
on
its
way
to
the
prison
a
little
before
nine
the
young
girl
heard
a
great
noise
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
whole
town
must
be
rushing
in
the
same
direction
she
strove
to
lose
herself
in
prayer
that
she
might
not
hear
these
different
sounds
that
spoke
to
her
in
an
unknown
language
of
which
her
anguish
told
her
she
understood
every
word
in
truth
a
terrible
thing
was
happening
at
the
prison
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
whole
town
had
rushed
thither
at
nine
o
clock
père
courtois
entered
the
jail
to
tell
the
prisoners
at
one
and
the
same
time
that
their
appeal
had
been
rejected
and
that
they
must
prepare
for
immediate
death
he
found
the
four
prisoners
armed
to
the
teeth
the
jailer
taken
unawares
was
pulled
into
the
cell
and
the
door
locked
behind
him
then
the
young
men
without
any
defence
on
his
part
so
astonished
was
he
seized
his
keys
and
passing
through
the
door
opposite
to
the
one
by
which
he
had
entered
they
locked
it
on
him
leaving
him
in
their
cell
they
found
themselves
in
the
adjoining
one
in
which
he
had
placed
three
of
them
during
amélie
s
interview
with
morgan
one
of
the
keys
on
the
jailer
s
bunch
opened
the
other
door
of
this
cell
and
that
door
led
to
the
inner
courtyard
of
the
prison
this
courtyard
was
closed
by
three
massive
doors
all
of
which
led
to
a
sort
of
lobby
opening
upon
the
porter
s
lodge
which
in
turn
adjoined
the
from
this
lodge
fifteen
steps
led
down
into
a
vast
courtyard
closed
by
an
iron
gate
and
railing
usually
this
gate
was
only
locked
at
night
if
it
should
happen
to
be
open
on
this
occasion
it
would
offer
a
possibility
of
escape
morgan
found
the
key
of
the
prisoners
court
opened
the
door
and
rushed
with
his
companions
to
the
porter
s
lodge
and
to
the
portico
from
which
the
fifteen
steps
led
down
into
the
courtyard
from
there
the
three
young
men
could
see
that
all
hope
was
lost
the
iron
gate
was
closed
and
eighty
men
dragoons
and
gendarmes
were
drawn
up
in
front
of
it
when
the
four
prisoners
free
and
armed
to
the
teeth
sprang
from
the
porter
s
lodge
to
the
portico
a
great
cry
a
cry
of
astonishment
and
terror
burst
from
the
crowd
in
the
street
beyond
the
railing
their
aspect
was
formidable
indeed
for
to
preserve
the
freedom
of
their
movements
perhaps
to
hide
the
shedding
of
blood
which
would
have
shown
so
quickly
on
their
white
linen
they
were
naked
to
the
waist
a
handkerchief
knotted
around
their
middle
bristled
with
weapons
a
glance
sufficed
to
show
them
that
they
were
indeed
masters
of
their
own
lives
but
not
of
their
liberty
amid
the
clamoring
of
the
crowd
and
the
clanking
of
the
sabres
as
they
were
drawn
from
their
scabbards
the
young
men
paused
an
instant
and
conferred
together
then
montbar
after
shaking
hands
with
his
companions
walked
down
the
fifteen
steps
and
advanced
to
the
gate
when
he
was
within
four
yards
of
the
gate
he
turned
with
a
last
glance
at
his
comrades
bowed
graciously
to
the
now
silent
mob
and
said
to
the
soldiers
very
well
gentlemen
of
the
gendarmerie
very
well
dragoons
then
placing
the
muzzle
of
his
pistol
to
his
mouth
he
blew
out
his
brains
confused
and
frantic
cries
followed
the
explosion
but
ceased
almost
immediately
as
valensolle
came
down
the
steps
holding
in
his
hand
a
dagger
with
a
straight
and
pointed
blade
his
pistols
which
he
did
not
seem
inclined
to
use
were
still
in
his
belt
he
advanced
to
a
sort
of
shed
supported
on
three
pillars
stopped
at
the
first
pillar
rested
the
hilt
of
his
dagger
upon
it
and
with
a
last
salutation
to
his
friends
clasped
the
column
with
one
arm
till
the
blade
had
disappeared
in
his
breast
for
an
instant
he
remained
standing
then
a
mortal
pallor
overspread
his
face
his
arm
loosened
its
hold
and
he
fell
to
the
ground
the
crowd
was
mute
paralyzed
with
horror
it
was
now
ribier
s
turn
he
advanced
to
the
gate
and
once
there
aimed
the
two
pistols
he
held
at
the
gendarmes
he
did
not
fire
but
the
gendarmes
did
three
or
four
shots
were
heard
and
ribier
fell
pierced
by
two
balls
admiration
seized
upon
the
spectators
at
sight
of
these
successive
catastrophes
they
saw
that
the
young
men
were
willing
to
die
but
to
die
with
honor
and
as
they
willed
and
also
with
the
grace
of
the
gladiators
of
antiquity
silence
therefore
reigned
when
morgan
now
left
alone
came
smiling
down
the
steps
of
the
portico
and
held
up
his
hand
in
sign
that
he
wished
to
speak
besides
what
more
could
it
want
this
eager
mob
watching
for
blood
a
greater
sight
had
been
given
to
it
than
it
came
to
see
four
dead
men
had
been
promised
to
it
four
heads
were
to
be
cut
off
but
here
was
variety
in
death
unexpected
picturesque
it
was
natural
therefore
that
the
crowd
should
keep
silence
when
morgan
was
seen
to
advance
he
held
neither
pistols
nor
daggers
in
his
hands
they
were
in
his
belt
he
passed
the
body
of
valensolle
and
placed
himself
between
those
of
jayat
and
ribier
gentlemen
said
he
let
us
the
hush
that
followed
was
so
great
that
those
present
seemed
scarcely
to
breathe
morgan
said
there
lies
a
man
who
has
blown
out
his
brains
he
pointed
to
jayat
here
lies
one
who
stabbed
himself
he
designated
valensolle
a
third
who
has
been
shot
he
indicated
ribier
you
want
to
see
the
fourth
guillotined
i
understand
a
dreadful
shudder
passed
through
the
crowd
well
continued
morgan
i
am
willing
to
give
you
that
satisfaction
i
am
ready
but
i
desire
to
go
to
the
scaffold
in
my
own
way
no
one
shall
touch
me
if
any
one
does
come
near
me
i
shall
blow
out
his
brains
except
that
gentleman
continued
morgan
pointing
to
the
executioner
this
is
his
affair
and
mine
the
crowd
apparently
thought
this
request
reasonable
for
from
all
sides
came
the
cry
yes
yes
the
officer
saw
that
the
quickest
way
to
end
the
matter
was
to
yield
to
morgan
s
demand
will
you
promise
me
he
asked
that
if
your
hands
and
feet
are
not
bound
you
will
not
try
to
escape
i
give
my
word
of
honor
replied
morgan
then
said
the
officer
stand
aside
and
let
us
take
up
the
bodies
of
your
that
is
but
right
said
morgan
and
he
turned
aside
to
a
wall
about
ten
paces
distant
and
leaned
against
it
the
gate
opened
three
men
dressed
in
black
entered
the
courtyard
and
picked
up
the
bodies
one
after
the
other
ribier
was
not
quite
dead
he
opened
his
eyes
and
seemed
to
look
for
morgan
here
i
am
said
the
latter
rest
easy
dear
friend
i
ribier
closed
his
eyes
without
uttering
a
word
when
the
three
bodies
had
been
removed
the
officer
of
the
gendarmerie
addressed
morgan
are
you
ready
sir
he
asked
yes
replied
morgan
bowing
with
exquisite
politeness
then
i
and
he
took
his
place
between
a
platoon
of
gendarmerie
and
a
detachment
of
dragoons
will
you
mount
the
cart
sir
or
go
on
foot
asked
the
captain
on
foot
on
foot
sir
i
am
anxious
that
all
shall
see
it
is
my
pleasure
to
be
guillotined
and
that
i
am
not
the
sinister
procession
crossed
the
place
des
lisses
and
skirted
the
walls
of
the
hôtel
montbazon
the
cart
bearing
the
three
bodies
came
first
then
the
dragoons
then
morgan
walking
alone
in
a
clear
space
of
some
ten
feet
before
and
behind
him
then
the
gendarmes
at
the
end
of
the
wall
they
turned
to
the
left
suddenly
through
an
opening
that
existed
at
that
time
between
the
wall
and
the
morgan
saw
the
scaffold
raising
its
two
posts
to
heaven
like
two
bloody
arms
faugh
he
exclaimed
i
have
never
seen
a
guillotine
and
i
had
no
idea
it
was
so
then
without
further
remark
he
drew
his
dagger
and
plunged
it
into
his
breast
up
to
the
hilt
the
captain
of
the
gendarmerie
saw
the
movement
without
being
in
time
to
prevent
it
he
spurred
his
horse
toward
morgan
who
to
his
own
amazement
and
that
of
every
one
else
remained
standing
but
morgan
drawing
a
pistol
from
his
belt
and
cocking
it
exclaimed
stop
it
was
agreed
that
no
one
should
touch
me
i
shall
die
alone
or
three
of
us
will
die
the
captain
reined
back
his
horse
forward
said
morgan
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
guillotine
morgan
drew
out
his
dagger
and
struck
again
as
deeply
as
before
a
cry
of
rage
rather
than
pain
escaped
him
my
soul
must
be
riveted
to
my
body
he
said
then
as
the
assistants
wished
to
help
him
mount
the
scaffold
on
which
the
executioner
was
awaiting
him
he
cried
out
no
i
say
again
let
no
one
touch
then
he
mounted
the
three
steps
without
staggering
when
he
reached
the
platform
he
drew
out
the
dagger
again
and
struck
himself
a
third
time
then
a
frightful
laugh
burst
from
his
lips
flinging
the
dagger
which
he
had
wrenched
from
the
third
ineffectual
wound
at
the
feet
of
the
executioner
he
exclaimed
by
my
faith
i
have
done
enough
it
is
your
turn
do
it
if
you
a
minute
later
the
head
of
the
intrepid
young
man
fell
upon
the
scaffold
and
by
a
phenomenon
of
that
unconquerable
vitality
which
he
possessed
it
rebounded
and
rolled
forward
beyond
the
timbers
of
the
guillotine
go
to
bourg
as
i
did
and
they
will
tell
you
that
as
the
head
rolled
forward
it
was
heard
to
utter
the
name
of
amélie
the
dead
bodies
were
guillotined
after
the
living
one
so
that
the
spectators
instead
of
losing
anything
by
the
events
we
have
just
related
enjoyed
a
double
spectacle
chapter
liv
the
confession
three
days
after
the
events
we
have
just
recited
a
carriage
covered
with
dust
and
drawn
by
two
horses
white
with
foam
stopped
about
seven
of
the
evening
before
the
gate
of
the
château
des
to
the
great
astonishment
of
the
person
who
was
in
such
haste
to
arrive
the
gates
were
open
a
crowd
of
peasants
filled
the
courtyard
and
men
and
women
were
kneeling
on
the
portico
then
his
sense
of
hearing
being
rendered
more
acute
by
astonishment
at
what
he
had
seen
he
fancied
he
heard
the
ringing
of
a
bell
he
opened
the
door
of
the
chaise
sprang
out
crossed
the
courtyard
rapidly
went
up
the
portico
and
found
the
stairway
leading
to
the
first
floor
filled
with
people
up
the
stairs
he
ran
as
he
had
up
the
portico
and
heard
what
seemed
to
him
a
murmured
prayer
from
his
sister
s
bedroom
he
went
to
the
room
the
door
was
open
madame
de
montrevel
and
little
edouard
were
kneeling
beside
amélie
s
pillow
charlotte
michel
and
his
son
jacques
were
close
at
hand
the
curate
of
was
administering
the
last
sacraments
the
dismal
scene
was
lighted
only
by
the
light
of
the
the
reader
has
recognized
roland
in
the
traveller
whose
carriage
stopped
at
the
gate
the
bystanders
made
way
for
him
he
entered
the
room
with
his
head
uncovered
and
knelt
beside
his
mother
the
dying
girl
lay
on
her
back
her
hands
clasped
her
head
raised
on
her
pillows
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
sky
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
she
seemed
unconscious
of
roland
s
arrival
it
was
as
though
her
soul
were
floating
between
heaven
and
earth
while
the
body
still
belonged
to
this
world
madame
de
montrevel
s
hand
sought
that
of
roland
and
finding
it
the
poor
mother
dropped
her
head
on
his
shoulder
sobbing
the
sobs
passed
unnoticed
by
the
dying
girl
even
as
her
brother
s
arrival
had
done
she
lay
there
perfectly
immovable
only
when
the
viaticum
had
been
administered
when
the
priest
s
voice
promised
her
eternal
blessedness
her
marble
lips
appeared
to
live
again
and
she
murmured
in
a
feeble
but
intelligible
voice
amen
then
the
bell
rang
again
the
who
was
carrying
it
left
the
room
first
followed
by
the
two
acolytes
who
bore
the
tapers
then
the
and
lastly
the
priest
with
the
host
all
the
strangers
present
followed
the
procession
and
the
family
and
household
were
left
alone
the
house
an
instant
before
so
full
of
sound
and
life
was
silent
almost
deserted
the
dying
girl
had
not
moved
her
lips
were
closed
her
hands
clasped
her
eyes
raised
to
heaven
after
a
few
minutes
roland
stooped
to
his
mother
s
ear
and
whispered
come
out
with
me
mother
i
must
speak
to
madame
de
montrevel
rose
she
pushed
little
edouard
toward
the
bed
and
the
child
stood
on
tiptoe
to
kiss
his
sister
on
the
forehead
then
the
mother
followed
him
and
leaning
over
with
a
sob
she
pressed
a
kiss
upon
the
same
spot
roland
with
dry
eyes
but
a
breaking
heart
he
would
have
given
much
for
tears
in
which
to
drown
his
sorrow
kissed
his
sister
as
his
mother
and
little
brother
had
done
she
seemed
as
insensible
to
this
kiss
as
to
the
preceding
ones
edouard
left
the
room
followed
by
madame
de
montrevel
and
roland
just
as
they
reached
the
door
they
stopped
quivering
they
had
heard
the
name
of
roland
uttered
in
a
low
but
distinct
tone
roland
turned
amélie
called
him
a
second
time
did
you
call
me
amélie
he
asked
yes
replied
the
dying
girl
alone
or
with
my
mother
that
voice
devoid
of
emphasis
yet
perfectly
intelligible
had
something
glacial
about
it
it
was
like
an
echo
from
another
world
go
mother
said
roland
you
see
that
she
wishes
to
be
alone
with
o
my
god
murmured
madame
de
montrevel
can
there
still
be
hope
low
as
these
words
were
the
dying
girl
heard
them
no
mother
she
said
god
has
permitted
me
to
see
my
brother
again
but
i
go
to
madame
de
montrevel
groaned
roland
roland
she
said
she
is
there
roland
signed
to
her
to
leave
them
alone
and
she
went
away
with
little
edouard
roland
closed
the
door
and
returned
to
his
sister
s
bedside
with
unutterable
emotion
her
body
was
already
stiffening
in
death
the
breath
from
her
lips
would
scarcely
have
dimmed
a
mirror
the
eyes
only
were
fixed
and
brilliant
as
though
the
whole
remaining
life
of
the
body
dead
before
its
time
were
centred
there
roland
had
heard
of
this
strange
state
called
ecstasy
which
is
nothing
else
than
catalepsy
he
saw
that
amélie
was
a
victim
of
that
preliminary
death
i
am
here
sister
he
said
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
knew
you
would
come
she
replied
still
without
moving
and
i
waited
for
how
did
you
know
that
i
was
coming
asked
roland
i
saw
you
roland
shuddered
did
you
know
why
i
was
coming
he
asked
yes
i
prayed
god
so
earnestly
in
my
heart
that
he
gave
me
strength
to
rise
and
write
to
when
was
that
last
where
is
the
letter
under
my
pillow
take
it
and
read
roland
hesitated
an
instant
was
his
sister
delirious
poor
amélie
he
murmured
do
not
pity
me
she
said
i
go
to
join
whom
asked
roland
him
whom
i
loved
and
whom
you
roland
uttered
a
cry
this
was
delirium
or
else
what
did
his
sister
mean
amélie
said
he
i
came
to
question
you
about
lord
tanlay
yes
i
know
replied
the
young
girl
you
knew
how
could
you
know
did
i
not
tell
you
i
saw
you
coming
and
knew
why
you
came
then
answer
do
not
turn
me
from
god
and
from
him
roland
i
have
written
it
all
read
my
roland
slipped
his
hand
beneath
the
pillow
convinced
that
his
sister
was
delirious
to
his
great
astonishment
he
felt
a
paper
which
he
drew
out
it
was
a
sealed
letter
on
it
were
written
these
words
for
roland
who
will
come
he
went
over
to
the
in
order
to
read
the
letter
which
was
dated
the
night
before
at
eleven
o
clock
in
the
evening
my
brother
we
have
each
a
terrible
thing
to
forgive
the
other
roland
looked
at
his
sister
she
was
still
motionless
he
continued
to
read
i
loved
charles
de
i
did
more
than
love
him
he
was
my
lover
oh
muttered
the
young
man
between
his
teeth
he
shall
he
is
dead
said
amélie
the
young
man
gave
a
cry
of
astonishment
he
had
uttered
the
words
to
which
amélie
had
replied
too
low
even
to
hear
them
himself
his
eyes
went
back
to
the
letter
there
was
no
legal
marriage
possible
between
the
sister
of
roland
de
montrevel
and
the
leader
of
the
companions
of
jehu
that
was
the
terrible
secret
which
i
bore
and
it
crushed
me
one
person
alone
had
to
know
it
and
i
told
him
that
person
was
sir
john
tanlay
may
god
forever
bless
that
man
who
promised
to
break
off
an
impossible
marriage
and
who
kept
his
word
let
his
life
be
sacred
to
you
roland
he
has
been
my
only
friend
in
sorrow
and
his
tears
have
mingled
with
mine
i
loved
charles
de
i
was
his
mistress
that
is
the
terrible
thing
you
must
forgive
but
in
exchange
you
caused
his
death
that
is
the
terrible
thing
i
now
forgive
you
oh
come
fast
roland
for
i
can
not
die
till
you
are
here
to
die
is
to
see
him
again
to
die
is
to
be
with
him
and
never
to
leave
him
again
i
am
glad
to
die
all
was
clearly
and
plainly
written
there
was
no
sign
of
delirium
in
the
letter
roland
read
it
through
twice
and
stood
for
an
instant
silent
motionless
palpitating
full
of
bitterness
then
pity
got
the
better
of
his
anger
he
went
to
amélie
stretched
his
hand
over
her
and
said
sister
i
forgive
a
slight
quiver
shook
the
dying
body
and
now
she
said
call
my
mother
that
i
may
die
in
her
roland
opened
the
door
and
called
madame
de
montrevel
she
was
waiting
and
came
at
once
is
there
any
change
she
asked
eagerly
no
replied
roland
only
amélie
wishes
to
die
in
your
madame
de
montrevel
fell
upon
her
knees
beside
her
daughter
s
bed
then
amélie
as
though
an
invisible
hand
had
loosened
the
bonds
that
held
her
rigid
body
to
the
bed
rose
slowly
parted
the
hands
that
were
clasped
upon
her
breast
and
let
one
fall
slowly
into
those
of
her
mother
mother
she
said
you
gave
me
life
and
you
have
taken
it
from
me
i
bless
you
it
was
a
mother
s
act
there
was
no
happiness
possible
for
your
daughter
in
this
then
letting
her
other
hand
fall
into
that
of
roland
who
was
kneeling
on
the
other
side
of
the
bed
she
said
we
have
forgiven
each
other
brother
yes
dear
amélie
he
replied
and
from
the
depths
of
our
hearts
i
i
have
still
one
last
request
to
what
is
it
do
not
forget
that
lord
tanlay
has
been
my
best
fear
nothing
said
roland
lord
tanlay
s
life
is
sacred
to
amélie
drew
a
long
breath
then
in
a
voice
which
showed
her
growing
weakness
she
said
farewell
mother
farewell
roland
kiss
edouard
for
then
with
a
cry
from
her
soul
in
which
there
was
more
of
joy
than
sadness
she
said
here
i
am
charles
here
i
am
she
fell
back
upon
her
bed
withdrawing
her
two
hands
as
she
did
so
and
clasping
them
upon
her
breast
again
roland
and
his
mother
rose
and
leaned
over
her
she
had
resumed
her
first
position
except
that
her
eyelids
were
closed
and
her
breath
extinguished
amélie
s
martyrdom
was
over
she
was
dead
chapter
lv
invulnerable
amélie
died
during
the
night
of
monday
and
tuesday
that
is
to
say
the
and
of
june
on
the
evening
of
thursday
the
of
june
the
grand
opera
at
paris
was
crowded
for
the
second
presentation
of
ossian
or
the
the
great
admiration
which
the
first
consul
professed
for
the
poems
of
macpherson
was
universally
known
consequently
the
national
academy
as
much
in
flattery
as
from
literary
choice
had
brought
out
an
opera
which
in
spite
of
all
exertions
did
not
appear
until
a
month
after
general
bonaparte
had
left
paris
to
join
the
army
of
the
reserves
in
the
balcony
to
the
left
sat
a
lover
of
music
who
was
noticeable
for
the
deep
attention
he
paid
to
the
performance
during
the
interval
between
the
acts
the
came
to
him
and
said
in
a
low
voice
pardon
me
sir
are
you
sir
john
tanlay
i
in
that
case
my
lord
a
gentleman
has
a
message
to
give
you
he
says
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
and
asks
if
you
will
speak
to
him
in
the
oh
said
sir
john
is
he
an
officer
he
is
in
civilian
s
dress
but
he
looks
like
an
very
good
replied
sir
john
i
know
who
he
he
rose
and
followed
the
woman
roland
was
waiting
in
the
corridor
lord
tanlay
showed
no
surprise
on
seeing
him
but
the
stern
look
on
the
young
man
s
face
repressed
the
first
impulse
of
his
deep
affection
which
was
to
fling
himself
upon
his
friend
s
breast
here
i
am
sir
said
sir
john
roland
bowed
i
have
just
come
from
your
hotel
he
said
you
have
it
seems
taken
the
precaution
to
inform
the
porter
of
your
whereabout
every
time
you
have
gone
out
so
that
persons
who
have
business
with
you
should
know
where
to
find
that
is
true
the
precaution
is
a
good
one
especially
for
those
who
like
myself
come
from
a
long
distance
and
are
hurried
and
have
no
time
to
then
said
sir
john
was
it
to
see
me
that
you
left
the
army
and
came
to
paris
solely
for
that
honor
sir
and
i
trust
that
you
will
guess
my
motives
and
spare
me
the
necessity
of
explaining
from
this
moment
i
am
at
your
service
sir
replied
sir
john
at
what
hour
can
two
of
my
friends
wait
upon
you
from
seven
in
the
morning
until
midnight
unless
you
prefer
that
it
should
be
no
my
lord
i
have
but
just
arrived
and
i
must
have
time
to
find
my
friends
and
give
them
my
instructions
if
it
will
not
inconvenience
you
they
will
probably
call
upon
you
between
ten
and
eleven
i
shall
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
if
the
affair
we
have
to
settle
could
be
arranged
for
the
same
i
believe
that
will
be
possible
sir
as
i
understand
it
to
be
your
wish
the
delay
will
not
be
from
my
that
is
all
i
wished
to
know
my
lord
pray
do
not
let
me
detain
you
roland
bowed
and
sir
john
returned
the
salutation
then
the
young
man
left
the
theatre
and
sir
john
returned
to
his
seat
in
the
balcony
the
words
had
been
exchanged
in
such
perfectly
well
modulated
voices
and
with
such
an
impassible
expression
of
countenance
on
both
sides
that
no
one
would
have
supposed
that
a
quarrel
had
arisen
between
the
two
men
who
had
just
greeted
each
other
so
courteously
it
happened
to
be
the
reception
day
of
the
minister
of
war
roland
returned
to
his
hotel
removed
the
traces
of
his
journey
jumped
into
a
carriage
and
a
little
before
ten
he
was
announced
in
the
salon
of
the
citizen
carnot
two
purposes
took
him
there
in
the
first
place
he
had
a
verbal
communication
to
make
to
the
minister
of
war
from
the
first
consul
in
the
second
place
he
hoped
to
find
there
the
two
witnesses
he
was
in
need
of
to
arrange
his
meeting
with
sir
john
everything
happened
as
roland
had
hoped
he
gave
the
minister
of
war
all
the
details
of
the
crossing
of
the
mont
and
the
situation
of
the
army
and
he
himself
found
the
two
friends
of
whom
he
was
in
search
a
few
words
sufficed
to
let
them
know
what
he
wished
soldiers
are
particularly
open
to
such
confidences
roland
spoke
of
a
grave
insult
the
nature
of
which
must
remain
a
secret
even
to
his
seconds
he
declared
that
he
was
the
offended
party
and
claimed
the
choice
of
weapons
and
mode
of
fighting
advantages
which
belong
to
the
challenger
the
young
fellows
agreed
to
present
themselves
to
sir
john
the
following
morning
at
the
hôtel
mirabeau
rue
de
richelieu
at
nine
o
clock
and
make
the
necessary
arrangements
with
sir
john
s
seconds
after
that
they
would
join
roland
at
the
hôtel
de
paris
in
the
same
street
roland
returned
to
his
room
at
eleven
that
evening
wrote
for
about
an
hour
then
went
to
bed
and
to
sleep
at
nine
the
next
morning
his
friends
came
to
him
they
had
just
left
sir
john
he
admitted
all
roland
s
contentions
declared
that
he
would
not
discuss
any
of
the
arrangements
adding
that
if
roland
regarded
himself
as
the
injured
party
it
was
for
him
to
dictate
the
conditions
to
their
remark
that
they
had
hoped
to
discuss
such
matters
with
two
of
his
friends
and
not
with
himself
he
replied
that
he
knew
no
one
in
paris
intimately
enough
to
ask
their
assistance
in
such
a
matter
and
that
he
hoped
once
on
the
ground
that
one
of
roland
s
seconds
would
consent
to
act
in
his
behalf
the
two
officers
were
agreed
that
lord
tanlay
had
conducted
himself
with
the
utmost
punctiliousness
in
every
respect
roland
declared
that
sir
john
s
request
for
the
services
of
one
of
his
two
seconds
was
not
only
just
but
suitable
and
he
authorized
either
one
of
them
to
act
for
sir
john
and
to
take
charge
of
his
interests
all
that
remained
for
roland
to
do
was
to
dictate
his
conditions
they
were
as
follows
pistols
were
chosen
when
loaded
the
adversaries
were
to
stand
at
five
paces
at
the
third
clap
of
the
seconds
hands
they
were
to
fire
it
was
as
we
see
a
duel
to
the
death
in
which
if
either
survived
he
would
be
at
the
mercy
of
his
opponent
consequently
the
young
officers
made
many
objections
but
roland
insisted
declaring
that
he
alone
could
judge
of
the
gravity
of
the
insult
offered
him
and
that
no
other
reparation
than
this
would
satisfy
him
they
were
obliged
to
yield
to
such
obstinacy
but
the
friend
who
was
to
act
as
sir
john
s
second
refused
to
bind
himself
for
his
principal
declaring
that
unless
sir
john
ordered
it
he
would
refuse
to
be
a
party
to
such
a
murder
don
t
excite
yourself
dear
friend
said
roland
i
know
sir
john
and
i
think
he
will
be
more
accommodating
than
the
seconds
returned
to
sir
john
they
found
him
at
his
english
breakfast
of
beefsteak
potatoes
and
tea
on
seeing
them
he
rose
invited
them
to
share
his
repast
and
on
their
refusing
placed
himself
at
their
disposal
they
began
by
assuring
him
that
he
could
count
upon
one
of
them
to
act
as
his
second
the
one
acting
for
roland
announced
the
conditions
at
each
stipulation
sir
john
bowed
his
head
in
token
of
assent
and
merely
replied
very
good
the
one
who
had
taken
charge
of
his
interests
attempted
to
make
some
objections
to
a
form
of
combat
that
unless
something
impossible
to
foresee
occurred
must
end
in
the
death
of
both
parties
but
lord
tanlay
begged
him
to
make
no
objections
m
de
montrevel
is
a
gallant
man
he
said
i
do
not
wish
to
thwart
him
in
anything
whatever
he
does
is
it
only
remained
to
settle
the
hour
and
the
place
of
meeting
on
these
points
sir
john
again
placed
himself
at
roland
s
disposal
the
two
seconds
left
even
more
delighted
with
him
after
this
interview
than
they
had
been
after
the
first
roland
was
waiting
for
them
and
listened
to
what
had
taken
place
what
did
i
tell
you
he
asked
they
requested
him
to
name
the
time
and
place
he
selected
seven
o
clock
in
the
evening
in
the
allée
de
la
muette
at
that
hour
the
bois
was
almost
deserted
but
the
light
was
still
good
enough
it
will
be
remembered
that
this
was
in
the
month
of
june
for
the
two
adversaries
to
fight
with
any
weapon
no
one
had
spoken
of
the
pistols
the
young
men
proposed
to
get
them
at
an
armorer
s
no
said
roland
sir
john
has
an
excellent
pair
of
duelling
pistols
which
i
have
already
used
if
he
is
not
unwilling
to
fight
with
those
pistols
i
should
prefer
them
to
all
the
young
man
who
was
now
acting
as
sir
john
s
second
went
to
him
with
the
three
following
questions
whether
the
time
and
place
suited
him
and
whether
he
would
allow
his
pistols
to
be
used
lord
tanlay
replied
by
regulating
his
watch
by
that
of
his
second
and
by
handing
him
the
box
of
pistols
shall
i
call
for
you
my
lord
asked
the
young
man
sir
john
smiled
sadly
needless
he
replied
you
are
de
montrevel
s
friend
and
you
will
find
the
drive
pleasanter
with
him
than
with
me
i
will
go
on
horseback
with
my
servant
you
will
find
me
on
the
the
young
officer
carried
this
reply
to
roland
what
did
i
tell
you
observed
roland
again
it
was
then
there
were
still
seven
hours
before
them
and
roland
dismissed
his
friends
to
their
various
pleasures
and
occupations
at
six
precisely
they
were
to
be
at
his
door
with
three
horses
and
two
servants
it
was
necessary
in
order
to
avoid
interference
that
the
trip
should
appear
to
be
nothing
more
than
an
ordinary
promenade
at
six
precisely
the
waiter
informed
roland
that
his
friends
were
in
the
courtyard
roland
greeted
them
cordially
and
sprang
into
his
saddle
the
party
followed
the
boulevards
as
far
as
the
place
louis
xv
and
then
turned
up
the
champs
elysées
on
the
way
the
strange
phenomenon
that
had
so
much
astonished
sir
john
at
the
time
of
roland
s
duel
with
de
barjols
recurred
roland
s
gayety
might
have
been
thought
an
affectation
had
it
not
been
so
evidently
genuine
the
two
young
men
acting
as
seconds
were
of
undoubted
courage
but
even
they
were
bewildered
by
such
utter
indifference
they
might
have
understood
it
had
this
affair
been
an
ordinary
duel
for
coolness
and
dexterity
insure
their
possessor
a
great
advantage
over
his
adversary
but
in
a
combat
like
this
to
which
they
were
going
neither
coolness
nor
dexterity
would
avail
to
save
the
combatants
if
not
from
death
at
least
from
some
terrible
wound
furthermore
roland
urged
on
his
horse
like
a
man
in
haste
so
that
they
reached
the
end
of
the
allée
de
la
muette
five
minutes
before
the
appointed
time
a
man
was
walking
in
the
allée
roland
recognized
sir
john
the
seconds
watched
the
young
man
s
face
as
he
caught
sight
of
his
adversary
to
their
great
astonishment
it
expressed
only
tender
a
few
more
steps
and
the
four
principal
actors
in
the
scene
that
was
about
to
take
place
met
sir
john
was
perfectly
calm
but
his
face
wore
a
look
of
profound
sadness
it
was
evident
that
this
meeting
grieved
him
as
deeply
as
it
seemed
to
rejoice
roland
the
party
dismounted
one
of
the
seconds
took
the
box
of
pistols
from
the
servants
and
ordered
them
to
lead
away
the
horses
and
not
to
return
until
they
heard
the
principals
then
entered
the
part
of
the
woods
that
seemed
the
thickest
and
looked
about
them
for
a
suitable
spot
for
the
rest
as
roland
had
foreseen
the
bois
was
deserted
the
approach
of
the
dinner
hour
had
called
every
one
home
they
found
a
small
open
spot
exactly
suited
to
their
needs
the
seconds
looked
at
roland
and
sir
john
they
both
nodded
their
heads
in
approval
is
there
to
be
any
change
one
of
the
seconds
asked
sir
john
ask
de
montrevel
replied
lord
tanlay
i
am
entirely
at
his
nothing
said
roland
the
seconds
took
the
pistols
from
the
box
and
loaded
them
sir
john
stood
apart
switching
the
heads
of
the
tall
grasses
with
his
roland
watched
him
hesitatingly
for
a
moment
then
taking
his
resolve
he
walked
resolutely
toward
him
sir
john
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
him
with
apparent
hope
my
lord
said
roland
i
may
have
certain
grievances
against
you
but
i
know
you
to
be
none
the
less
a
man
of
your
you
are
right
replied
sir
john
if
you
survive
me
will
you
keep
the
promise
that
you
made
me
at
avignon
there
is
no
possibility
that
i
shall
survive
you
but
so
long
as
i
have
any
breath
left
in
my
body
you
can
count
upon
i
refer
to
the
final
disposition
to
be
made
of
my
the
same
i
presume
as
at
avignon
the
same
my
very
well
you
may
set
your
mind
at
roland
bowed
to
sir
john
and
returned
to
his
friends
have
you
any
wishes
in
case
the
affair
terminates
fatally
asked
one
of
them
one
what
is
it
that
you
permit
sir
john
to
take
entire
charge
of
the
funeral
arrangements
for
the
rest
i
have
a
note
in
my
left
hand
for
him
in
case
i
have
not
time
to
speak
after
the
affair
is
over
you
are
to
open
my
hand
and
give
him
the
is
that
all
the
pistols
are
loaded
very
well
inform
sir
one
of
the
seconds
approached
sir
john
the
other
measured
off
five
paces
roland
saw
that
the
distance
was
greater
than
he
had
supposed
excuse
me
he
said
i
said
three
five
replied
the
officer
who
was
measuring
the
distance
not
at
all
dear
friend
you
are
he
turned
to
sir
john
and
to
the
other
second
questioningly
three
paces
will
do
very
well
replied
sir
john
bowing
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
if
the
two
adversaries
were
agreed
the
five
paces
were
reduced
to
three
then
two
sabres
were
laid
on
the
ground
to
mark
the
limit
sir
john
and
roland
took
their
places
standing
so
that
their
toes
touched
the
sabres
a
pistol
was
then
handed
to
each
of
them
they
bowed
to
say
that
they
were
ready
the
two
seconds
stepped
aside
they
were
to
give
the
signal
by
clapping
their
hands
three
times
at
the
first
clap
the
principals
were
to
cock
their
pistols
at
the
second
to
take
aim
at
the
third
to
fire
the
three
claps
were
given
at
regular
intervals
amid
the
most
profound
silence
the
wind
itself
seemed
to
pause
and
the
rustle
of
the
trees
was
hushed
the
principals
were
calm
but
the
seconds
were
visibly
distressed
at
the
third
clap
two
shots
rang
out
so
simultaneously
that
they
seemed
but
one
but
to
the
utter
astonishment
of
the
seconds
the
combatants
remained
standing
at
the
signal
roland
had
lowered
his
pistol
and
fired
into
the
ground
sir
john
had
raised
his
and
cut
the
branch
of
a
tree
three
feet
behind
roland
each
was
clearly
amazed
amazed
that
he
himself
was
still
living
after
having
spared
his
antagonist
roland
was
the
first
to
speak
ah
he
cried
my
sister
was
right
in
saying
that
you
were
the
most
generous
man
on
and
throwing
his
pistol
aside
he
opened
his
arms
to
sir
john
who
rushed
into
them
ah
i
understand
he
said
you
wanted
to
die
but
god
be
thanked
i
am
not
your
the
two
seconds
came
up
what
is
the
matter
they
asked
together
nothing
said
roland
except
that
i
could
not
die
by
the
hand
of
the
man
i
love
best
on
earth
you
saw
for
yourselves
that
he
preferred
to
die
rather
than
kill
then
throwing
himself
once
more
into
sir
john
s
arms
and
grasping
the
hands
of
his
two
friends
he
said
i
see
that
i
must
leave
that
to
the
austrians
and
now
gentlemen
you
must
excuse
me
the
first
consul
is
on
the
eve
of
a
great
battle
in
italy
and
i
have
not
a
moment
to
lose
if
i
am
to
be
leaving
sir
john
to
make
what
explanations
he
thought
suitable
to
the
seconds
roland
rushed
to
the
road
sprang
upon
his
horse
and
returned
to
paris
at
a
gallop
chapter

conclusion
in
the
meantime
the
french
army
continued
its
march
and
on
the
of
june
it
entered
milan
there
was
little
resistance
the
fort
of
milan
was
invested
murat
sent
to
piacenza
had
taken
the
city
without
a
blow
lannes
had
defeated
general
ott
at
montebello
thus
disposed
the
french
army
was
in
the
rear
of
the
austrians
before
the
latter
were
aware
of
it
during
the
night
of
the
of
june
a
courier
arrived
from
murat
who
as
we
have
said
was
occupying
piacenza
murat
had
intercepted
a
despatch
from
general
melas
and
was
now
sending
it
to
bonaparte
this
despatch
announced
the
capitulation
of
genoa
masséna
after
eating
horses
dogs
cats
and
rats
had
been
forced
to
surrender
melas
spoke
of
the
army
of
the
reserves
with
the
utmost
contempt
he
declared
that
the
story
of
bonaparte
s
presence
in
italy
was
a
hoax
and
asserted
that
he
knew
for
certain
that
the
first
consul
was
in
paris
here
was
news
that
must
instantly
be
imparted
to
bonaparte
for
it
came
under
the
category
of
bad
news
consequently
bourrienne
woke
him
up
at
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
translated
the
despatch
bonaparte
s
first
words
were
as
follows
pooh
bourrienne
you
don
t
understand
but
bourrienne
repeated
the
translation
word
for
word
after
this
reading
the
general
rose
had
everybody
waked
up
gave
his
orders
and
then
went
back
to
bed
and
to
sleep
that
same
day
he
left
milan
and
established
his
headquarters
at
stradella
there
he
remained
until
june
left
on
the
and
marched
to
the
scrivia
through
montebello
where
he
saw
the
field
still
torn
and
bleeding
after
lannes
victory
the
traces
of
death
were
everywhere
the
church
was
still
overflowing
with
the
dead
and
wounded
the
devil
said
the
first
consul
to
the
victor
you
must
have
made
it
pretty
hot
so
hot
general
that
the
bones
in
my
division
were
cracking
and
rattling
like
hail
on
a
desaix
joined
the
first
consul
on
the
of
june
while
he
was
still
at
stradella
released
by
the
capitulation
of
he
had
reached
toulon
the
of
may
the
very
day
on
which
bonaparte
left
paris
at
the
foot
of
the
mont
bonaparte
received
a
letter
from
him
asking
whether
he
should
march
to
paris
or
rejoin
the
army
start
for
paris
indeed
exclaimed
bonaparte
write
him
to
rejoin
the
army
at
headquarters
wherever
that
may
bourrienne
had
written
and
as
we
have
seen
desaix
joined
the
army
the
of
june
at
stradella
the
first
consul
received
him
with
twofold
joy
in
the
first
place
he
regained
a
man
without
ambition
an
intelligent
officer
and
a
devoted
friend
in
the
second
place
desaix
arrived
just
in
the
nick
of
time
to
take
charge
of
the
division
lately
under
boudet
who
had
been
killed
through
a
false
report
received
through
general
gardannes
the
first
consul
was
led
to
believe
that
the
enemy
refused
to
give
battle
and
was
retiring
to
genoa
he
sent
desaix
and
his
division
on
the
road
to
novi
to
cut
them
off
the
night
of
the
passed
tranquilly
in
spite
of
a
heavy
storm
an
engagement
had
taken
place
the
preceding
evening
in
which
the
austrians
had
been
defeated
it
seemed
as
though
men
and
nature
were
wearied
alike
for
all
was
still
during
the
night
bonaparte
was
easy
in
his
mind
there
was
but
one
bridge
over
the
bormida
and
he
had
been
assured
that
that
was
down
pickets
were
stationed
as
far
as
possible
along
the
bormida
each
with
four
scouts
the
whole
of
the
night
was
occupied
by
the
enemy
in
crossing
the
river
at
two
in
the
morning
two
parties
of
scouts
were
captured
seven
of
the
eight
men
were
killed
the
eighth
made
his
way
back
to
camp
crying
to
arms
a
courier
was
instantly
despatched
to
the
first
consul
who
was
sleeping
at
torre
di
galifo
meanwhile
till
orders
could
be
received
the
drums
beat
to
arms
all
along
the
line
a
man
must
have
shared
in
such
a
scene
to
understand
the
effect
produced
on
a
sleeping
army
by
the
roll
of
drums
calling
to
arms
at
three
in
the
morning
the
bravest
shuddered
the
troops
were
sleeping
in
their
clothes
every
man
sprang
up
ran
to
the
stacked
arms
and
seized
his
weapons
the
lines
formed
on
the
vast
plains
of
marengo
the
noise
of
the
drums
swept
on
like
a
train
of
lighted
powder
in
the
dim
the
hasty
movements
of
the
pickets
could
be
seen
when
the
day
broke
the
french
troops
were
stationed
as
follows
the
division
gardannes
and
the
division
chamberlhac
forming
the
extreme
advance
were
encamped
around
a
little
called
petra
bona
at
the
angle
formed
by
the
highroad
from
marengo
to
tortona
and
the
bormida
which
crosses
the
road
on
its
way
to
the
tanaro
the
corps
of
general
lannes
was
before
the
village
of
san
giuliano
the
place
which
bonaparte
had
pointed
out
to
roland
three
months
earlier
telling
him
that
on
that
spot
the
fate
of
the
campaign
would
be
decided
the
consular
guard
was
stationed
some
five
hundred
yards
or
so
in
the
rear
of
lannes
the
cavalry
brigade
under
general
kellermann
and
a
few
squadrons
of
chasseurs
and
hussars
forming
the
left
filled
up
along
the
advanced
line
the
gap
between
the
divisions
of
gardannes
and
chamberlhac
a
second
brigade
under
general
champeaux
filled
up
the
gap
on
the
right
between
general
lannes
cavalry
and
finally
the
twelfth
regiment
of
hussars
and
the
chasseurs
detached
by
murat
under
the
orders
of
general
rivaud
occupied
the
opening
of
the
valley
of
salo
and
the
extreme
right
of
the
position
these
forces
amounted
to
about
or
six
thousand
men
not
counting
the
divisions
monnet
and
boudet
ten
thousand
men
in
all
commanded
by
desaix
and
now
as
we
have
said
detached
from
the
main
army
to
cut
off
the
retreat
of
the
enemy
to
genoa
only
instead
of
making
that
retreat
the
enemy
were
now
attacking
during
the
day
of
the
of
june
general
melas
of
the
austrian
army
having
succeeded
in
reuniting
the
troops
of
generals
haddich
kaim
and
ott
crossed
the
tanaro
and
was
now
encamped
before
alessandria
with
thousand
infantry
seven
thousand
cavalry
and
a
numerous
and
artillery
at
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
firing
began
and
general
victor
assigned
all
to
their
line
of
battle
at
five
bonaparte
was
awakened
by
the
sound
of
cannon
while
he
was
dressing
general
victor
s
rode
up
to
tell
him
that
the
enemy
had
crossed
the
bormida
and
was
attacking
all
along
the
line
of
battle
the
first
consul
called
for
his
horse
and
springing
upon
it
galloped
off
toward
the
spot
where
the
fighting
was
going
on
from
the
summit
of
the
hill
he
could
overlook
the
position
of
both
armies
the
enemy
was
formed
in
three
columns
that
on
the
left
comprising
all
the
cavalry
and
light
infantry
was
moving
toward
by
the
salo
road
while
the
columns
of
the
right
and
centre
resting
upon
each
other
and
comprising
the
infantry
regiments
under
generals
haddich
kaim
and
o
reilly
and
the
reserve
of
grenadiers
under
command
of
general
ott
were
advancing
along
the
tortona
road
and
up
the
bormida
the
moment
they
crossed
the
river
the
latter
columns
came
in
contact
with
the
troops
of
general
gardannes
posted
as
we
have
said
at
the
farmhouse
and
the
ravine
of
petra
bona
it
was
the
noise
of
the
artillery
advancing
in
this
direction
that
had
brought
bonaparte
to
the
scene
of
battle
he
arrived
just
as
gardannes
division
crushed
under
the
fire
of
that
artillery
was
beginning
to
fall
back
and
general
victor
was
sending
forward
chamberlhac
s
division
to
its
support
protected
by
this
move
gardannes
troops
retreated
in
good
order
and
covered
the
village
of
marengo
the
situation
was
critical
all
the
plans
of
the
were
overthrown
instead
of
attacking
as
was
his
wont
with
troops
judiciously
massed
he
was
attacked
himself
before
he
could
concentrate
his
forces
the
austrians
profiting
by
the
sweep
of
land
that
lay
before
them
ceased
to
march
in
columns
and
deployed
in
lines
parallel
to
those
of
gardannes
and
chamberlhac
with
this
difference
that
they
were
two
to
the
french
army
s
one
the
first
of
these
lines
was
commanded
by
general
haddich
the
second
by
general
melas
the
third
by
general
ott
at
a
short
distance
from
the
bormida
flows
a
stream
called
the
fontanone
which
passes
through
a
deep
ravine
forming
a
semicircle
round
the
village
of
marengo
and
protecting
it
general
victor
had
already
divined
the
advantages
to
be
derived
from
this
natural
intrenchment
and
he
used
it
to
rally
the
divisions
of
gardannes
and
chamberlhac
bonaparte
approving
victor
s
arrangements
sent
him
word
to
defend
marengo
to
the
very
last
extremity
he
himself
needed
time
to
prepare
his
game
on
this
great
inclosed
between
the
bormida
the
fontanone
and
marengo
his
first
step
was
to
recall
desaix
then
marching
as
we
have
said
to
cut
the
retreat
to
genoa
general
bonaparte
sent
off
two
or
three
with
orders
not
to
stop
until
they
had
reached
that
corps
then
he
waited
seeing
clearly
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
fall
back
in
as
orderly
a
manner
as
possible
until
he
could
gather
a
compact
mass
that
would
enable
him
not
only
to
stop
the
retrograde
movement
but
to
assume
the
offensive
but
this
waiting
was
horrible
presently
the
action
was
renewed
along
the
whole
line
the
austrians
had
reached
one
bank
of
the
fontanone
of
which
the
french
occupied
the
other
each
was
firing
on
the
other
from
either
side
of
the
ravine
flew
from
side
to
side
within
pistol
range
protected
by
its
terrible
artillery
the
enemy
had
only
to
extend
himself
a
little
more
to
overwhelm
bonaparte
s
forces
general
rivaud
of
gardannes
division
saw
the
austrians
preparing
for
this
manoeuvre
he
marched
out
from
marengo
and
placed
a
battalion
in
the
open
with
orders
to
die
there
rather
than
retreat
then
while
that
battalion
drew
the
enemy
s
fire
he
formed
his
cavalry
in
column
came
round
the
flank
of
the
battalion
fell
upon
three
thousand
austrians
advancing
to
the
charge
repulsed
them
threw
them
into
disorder
and
all
wounded
as
he
was
by
a
splintered
ball
forced
them
back
behind
their
own
lines
after
that
he
took
up
a
position
to
the
right
of
the
battalion
which
had
not
retreated
a
step
but
during
this
time
gardannes
division
which
had
been
struggling
with
the
enemy
from
early
morning
was
driven
back
upon
marengo
followed
by
the
first
austrian
line
which
forced
chamberlhac
s
division
to
retreat
in
like
manner
there
an
sent
by
bonaparte
ordered
the
two
divisions
to
rally
and
retake
marengo
at
any
cost
general
victor
reformed
them
put
himself
at
their
head
forced
his
way
through
the
streets
which
the
austrians
had
not
had
time
to
barricade
retook
the
village
lost
it
again
took
it
a
third
time
and
then
overwhelmed
by
numbers
lost
it
for
the
third
time
it
was
then
eleven
o
clock
desaix
overtaken
by
bonaparte
s
ought
at
that
hour
to
be
on
his
way
to
the
battle
meanwhile
lannes
with
his
two
divisions
came
to
the
help
of
his
struggling
comrades
this
reinforcement
enabled
gardannes
and
chamberlhac
to
reform
their
lines
parallel
to
the
enemy
who
had
now
debouched
through
marengo
to
the
right
and
also
to
the
left
of
the
village
the
austrians
were
on
the
point
of
overwhelming
the
french
lannes
forming
his
centre
with
the
divisions
rallied
by
victor
deployed
with
his
two
least
exhausted
divisions
for
the
purpose
of
opposing
them
to
the
austrian
wings
the
two
corps
the
one
excited
by
the
prospect
of
victory
the
other
refreshed
by
a
long
rest
flung
themselves
with
fury
into
the
fight
which
was
now
renewed
along
the
whole
line
after
struggling
an
hour
hand
to
hand
bayonet
to
bayonet
general
kaim
s
corps
fell
back
general
champeaux
at
the
head
of
the
first
and
eighth
regiments
of
dragoons
charged
upon
him
increasing
his
disorder
general
watrin
with
the
sixth
light
infantry
and
the
and
fortieth
of
the
line
started
in
pursuit
and
drove
him
nearly
a
thousand
rods
beyond
the
rivulet
but
this
movement
separated
the
french
from
their
own
corps
the
centre
divisions
were
endangered
by
the
victory
on
the
right
and
generals
watrin
and
champeaux
were
forced
to
fall
back
to
the
lines
they
had
left
uncovered
at
the
same
time
kellermann
was
doing
on
the
left
wing
what
champeaux
and
watrin
had
done
on
the
right
two
cavalry
charges
made
an
opening
through
the
enemy
s
line
but
behind
that
first
line
was
a
second
not
daring
to
go
further
forward
because
of
superior
numbers
kellermann
lost
the
fruits
of
that
momentary
victory
it
was
now
noon
the
french
army
which
undulated
like
a
flaming
serpent
along
a
front
of
some
three
miles
was
broken
in
the
centre
the
centre
retreating
abandoned
the
wings
the
wings
were
therefore
forced
to
follow
the
retrograde
movement
kellermann
to
the
left
watrin
to
the
right
had
given
their
men
the
order
to
fall
back
the
retreat
was
made
in
squares
under
the
fire
of
eighty
pieces
of
artillery
which
preceded
the
main
body
of
the
austrian
army
the
french
ranks
shrank
visibly
men
were
borne
to
the
ambulances
by
men
who
did
not
return
one
division
retreated
through
a
field
of
ripe
wheat
a
shell
burst
and
fired
the
straw
and
two
or
three
thousand
men
were
caught
in
the
midst
of
a
terrible
conflagration
exploded
and
fearful
disorder
reigned
in
the
ranks
it
was
then
that
bonaparte
sent
forward
the
consular
guard
up
they
went
at
a
charge
deployed
in
line
of
battle
and
stopped
the
enemy
s
advance
meantime
the
mounted
grenadiers
dashed
forward
at
a
gallop
and
overthrew
the
austrian
cavalry
meanwhile
the
division
which
had
escaped
from
the
conflagration
received
fresh
cartridges
and
reformed
in
line
but
this
movement
had
no
other
result
than
to
prevent
the
retreat
from
becoming
a
rout
it
was
two
o
clock
bonaparte
watched
the
battle
sitting
on
the
bank
of
a
ditch
beside
the
highroad
to
alessandria
he
was
alone
his
left
arm
was
slipped
through
his
horse
s
bridle
with
the
other
he
flicked
the
pebbles
in
the
road
with
the
tip
of
his
were
plowing
the
earth
about
him
he
seemed
indifferent
to
this
great
drama
on
which
hung
all
his
hopes
never
had
he
played
so
desperate
a
game
six
years
of
victory
against
the
crown
of
france
suddenly
he
roused
from
his
revery
amid
the
dreadful
roar
of
cannon
and
musketry
his
ear
caught
the
of
a
galloping
horse
he
raised
his
head
a
rider
dashing
along
at
full
speed
his
horse
covered
with
white
froth
came
from
the
direction
of
novi
when
he
was
within
fifty
feet
bonaparte
gave
one
cry
roland
the
latter
dashed
on
crying
desaix
desaix
desaix
bonaparte
opened
his
arms
roland
sprang
from
his
horse
and
flung
himself
upon
the
first
consul
s
neck
there
was
a
double
joy
for
bonaparte
in
this
arrival
that
of
again
seeing
a
man
whom
he
knew
would
be
devoted
to
him
unto
death
and
because
of
the
news
he
brought
and
desaix
he
questioned
is
within
three
miles
one
of
your
aides
met
him
retracing
his
steps
toward
the
then
said
bonaparte
he
may
yet
come
in
how
in
time
look
roland
glanced
at
the
battlefield
and
grasped
the
situation
in
an
instant
during
the
few
moments
that
had
elapsed
while
they
were
conversing
matters
had
gone
from
bad
to
worse
the
first
austrian
column
the
one
which
had
marched
on
and
had
not
yet
been
engaged
was
about
to
fall
on
the
right
of
the
french
army
if
it
broke
the
line
the
retreat
would
be
flight
desaix
would
come
too
late
take
my
last
two
regiments
of
grenadiers
said
bonaparte
rally
the
consular
guard
and
carry
it
with
you
to
the
extreme
right
you
understand
in
a
square
roland
and
stop
that
column
like
a
stone
there
was
not
an
instant
to
lose
roland
sprang
upon
his
horse
took
the
two
regiments
of
grenadiers
rallied
the
consular
guard
and
dashed
to
the
right
when
he
was
within
fifty
feet
of
general
elsnitz
s
column
he
called
out
in
square
the
first
consul
is
looking
at
us
the
square
formed
each
man
seemed
to
take
root
in
his
place
general
elsnitz
instead
of
continuing
his
way
in
the
movement
to
support
generals
melas
and
kaim
instead
of
despising
the
nine
hundred
men
who
present
no
cause
for
fear
in
the
rear
of
a
victorious
army
general
elsnitz
paused
and
turned
upon
them
with
fury
those
nine
hundred
men
were
indeed
the
stone
redoubt
that
general
bonaparte
had
ordered
them
to
be
artillery
musketry
bayonets
all
were
turned
upon
them
but
they
yielded
not
an
inch
bonaparte
was
watching
them
with
admiration
when
turning
in
the
direction
of
novi
he
caught
the
gleam
of
desaix
s
bayonets
standing
on
a
knoll
raised
above
the
plain
he
could
see
what
was
invisible
to
the
enemy
he
signed
to
a
group
of
officers
who
were
near
him
awaiting
orders
behind
stood
orderlies
holding
their
horses
the
officers
advanced
bonaparte
pointed
to
the
forest
of
bayonets
now
glistening
in
the
sunlight
and
said
to
one
of
the
officers
gallop
to
those
bayonets
and
tell
them
to
hasten
as
for
desaix
tell
him
i
am
waiting
for
him
the
officer
galloped
off
bonaparte
again
turned
his
eyes
to
the
battlefield
the
retreat
continued
but
roland
and
his
nine
hundred
had
stopped
general
elsnitz
and
his
column
the
stone
redoubt
was
transformed
into
a
volcano
it
was
belching
fire
from
all
four
sides
then
bonaparte
addressing
three
officers
cried
out
one
of
you
to
the
centre
the
other
two
to
the
wings
say
everywhere
that
the
reserves
are
at
hand
and
that
we
resume
the
the
three
officers
departed
like
arrows
shot
from
a
bow
their
ways
parting
in
direct
lines
to
their
different
destinations
bonaparte
watched
them
for
a
few
moments
and
when
he
turned
round
he
saw
a
rider
in
a
general
s
uniform
approaching
it
was
desaix
desaix
whom
he
had
left
in
egypt
and
who
that
very
morning
had
said
laughing
the
bullets
of
europe
don
t
recognize
me
some
is
surely
impending
over
one
grasp
of
the
hand
was
all
that
these
two
friends
needed
to
reveal
their
hearts
then
bonaparte
stretched
out
his
arm
toward
the
battlefield
a
single
glance
told
more
than
all
the
words
in
the
world
twenty
thousand
men
had
gone
into
the
fight
that
morning
and
now
scarcely
more
than
ten
thousand
were
left
within
a
radius
of
six
miles
only
nine
thousand
infantry
one
thousand
cavalry
and
ten
cannon
still
in
condition
for
use
one
quarter
of
the
army
was
either
dead
or
wounded
another
quarter
was
employed
in
removing
the
wounded
for
the
first
consul
would
not
suffer
them
to
be
abandoned
all
of
these
forces
save
and
excepting
roland
and
his
nine
hundred
men
were
retreating
the
vast
space
between
the
bormida
and
the
ground
over
which
the
army
was
now
retreating
was
covered
with
the
dead
bodies
of
men
and
horses
dismounted
cannon
and
shattered
ammunition
wagons
here
and
there
rose
columns
of
flame
and
smoke
from
the
burning
fields
of
grain
desaix
took
in
these
details
at
a
glance
what
do
you
think
of
the
battle
asked
bonaparte
i
think
that
this
one
is
lost
answered
desaix
but
as
it
is
only
three
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
we
have
time
to
gain
only
said
a
voice
we
need
cannon
this
voice
belonged
to
marmont
commanding
the
artillery
true
marmont
but
where
are
we
to
get
them
i
have
five
pieces
still
intact
from
the
battlefield
we
left
five
more
at
scrivia
which
are
just
coming
and
the
eight
pieces
i
have
with
me
said
desaix
eighteen
pieces
said
marmont
that
is
all
i
an
was
sent
to
hasten
the
arrival
of
desaix
s
guns
his
troops
were
advancing
rapidly
and
were
scarcely
half
a
mile
from
the
field
of
battle
their
line
of
approach
seemed
formed
for
the
purpose
at
hand
on
the
left
of
the
road
was
a
gigantic
perpendicular
hedge
protected
by
a
bank
the
infantry
was
made
to
file
in
a
narrow
line
along
it
and
it
even
hid
the
cavalry
from
view
during
this
time
marmont
had
collected
his
guns
and
stationed
them
in
battery
on
the
right
front
of
the
army
suddenly
they
burst
forth
vomiting
a
deluge
of
grapeshot
and
canister
upon
the
austrians
for
an
instant
the
enemy
wavered
bonaparte
profited
by
that
instant
of
hesitation
to
send
forward
the
whole
front
of
the
french
army
comrades
he
cried
we
have
made
steps
enough
backward
remember
it
is
my
custom
to
sleep
on
the
battlefield
at
the
same
moment
and
as
if
in
reply
to
marmont
s
cannonade
volleys
of
musketry
burst
forth
to
the
left
taking
the
austrians
in
flank
it
was
desaix
and
his
division
come
down
upon
them
at
short
range
and
enfilading
the
enemy
with
the
fire
of
his
guns
the
whole
army
knew
that
this
was
the
reserve
and
that
it
behooved
them
to
aid
this
reserve
by
a
supreme
effort
forward
rang
from
right
to
left
the
drums
beat
the
charge
the
austrians
who
had
not
seen
the
reserves
and
were
marching
with
their
guns
on
their
shoulders
as
if
at
parade
felt
that
something
strange
was
happening
within
the
french
lines
they
struggled
to
retain
the
victory
they
now
felt
to
be
slipping
from
their
grasp
but
everywhere
the
french
army
had
resumed
the
offensive
on
all
sides
the
ominous
roll
of
the
charge
and
the
victorious
marseillaise
were
heard
above
the
din
marmont
s
battery
belched
fire
kellermann
dashed
forward
with
his
cuirassiers
and
cut
his
way
through
both
lines
of
the
enemy
desaix
jumped
ditches
leaped
hedges
and
reaching
a
little
eminence
turned
to
see
if
his
division
were
still
following
him
there
he
fell
but
his
death
instead
of
diminishing
the
ardor
of
his
men
redoubled
it
and
they
charged
with
their
bayonets
upon
the
column
of
general
zach
at
that
moment
kellermann
who
had
broken
through
both
of
the
enemy
s
lines
saw
desaix
s
division
struggling
with
a
compact
immovable
mass
he
charged
in
flank
forced
his
way
into
a
gap
widened
it
broke
the
square
quartered
it
and
in
less
than
fifteen
minutes
the
five
thousand
austrian
grenadiers
who
formed
the
mass
were
overthrown
dispersed
crushed
annihilated
they
disappeared
like
smoke
general
zach
and
his
staff
all
that
was
left
were
taken
prisoners
then
in
turn
the
enemy
endeavored
to
make
use
of
his
immense
cavalry
corps
but
the
incessant
volleys
of
musketry
the
blasting
canister
the
terrible
bayonets
stopped
short
the
charge
murat
was
manoeuvring
on
the
flank
with
two
guns
and
a
howitzer
which
dealt
death
to
the
foe
he
paused
for
an
instant
to
succor
roland
and
his
nine
hundred
men
a
shell
from
the
howitzer
fell
and
burst
in
the
austrian
ranks
it
opened
a
gulf
of
flame
roland
sprang
into
it
a
pistol
in
one
hand
his
sword
in
the
other
the
whole
consular
guard
followed
him
opening
the
enemy
s
ranks
as
a
wedge
opens
the
trunk
of
an
oak
onward
he
dashed
till
he
reached
an
ammunition
wagon
surrounded
by
the
enemy
then
without
pausing
an
instant
he
thrust
the
hand
holding
the
pistol
through
the
opening
of
the
wagon
and
fired
a
frightful
explosion
followed
a
volcano
had
burst
its
crater
and
annihilated
those
around
it
general
elsnitz
s
corps
was
in
full
flight
the
rest
of
the
austrian
army
swayed
retreated
and
broke
the
generals
tried
in
vain
to
stop
the
torrent
and
form
up
for
a
retreat
in
thirty
minutes
the
french
army
had
crossed
the
plain
it
had
defended
foot
by
foot
for
eight
hours
the
enemy
did
not
stop
until
marengo
was
reached
there
they
made
a
vain
attempt
to
reform
under
fire
of
the
artillery
of
forgotten
at
and
not
recovered
until
the
day
was
over
but
the
desaix
gardannes
and
chamberlhac
divisions
coming
up
at
a
run
pursued
the
flying
austrians
through
the
streets
marengo
was
carried
the
enemy
retired
on
petra
bona
and
that
too
was
taken
then
the
austrians
rushed
toward
the
bridge
of
the
bormida
but
was
there
before
them
the
flying
multitudes
sought
the
fords
or
plunged
into
the
bormida
under
a
devastating
fire
which
did
not
slacken
before
ten
that
night
the
remains
of
the
austrian
army
regained
their
camp
at
alessandria
the
french
army
bivouacked
near
the
bridge
the
day
had
cost
the
austrian
army
four
thousand
five
hundred
men
killed
six
thousand
wounded
five
thousand
prisoners
besides
twelve
flags
and
thirty
cannon
never
did
fortune
show
herself
under
two
such
opposite
aspects
as
on
that
day
at
two
in
the
afternoon
the
day
spelt
defeat
and
its
disastrous
consequences
to
bonaparte
at
five
it
was
italy
reconquered
and
the
throne
of
france
in
prospect
that
night
the
first
consul
wrote
the
following
letter
to
madame
de
montrevel
madame
i
have
won
my
greatest
victory
but
it
has
cost
me
the
two
halves
of
my
heart
desaix
and
roland
do
not
grieve
madame
your
son
did
not
care
to
live
and
he
could
not
have
died
more
gloriously
bonaparte
many
futile
efforts
were
made
to
recover
the
body
of
the
young
like
romulus
he
had
vanished
in
a
whirlwind
none
ever
knew
why
he
had
pursued
death
with
such
eager
longing
the
end
