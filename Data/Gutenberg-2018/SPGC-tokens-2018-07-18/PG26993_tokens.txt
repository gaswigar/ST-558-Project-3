startling
introduction
of
tom
trefethen
look
out
there
my
god
he
is
under
the
wheels
the
train
for
red
jacket
had
just
started
from
the
hancock
station
and
was
gathering
quick
headway
for
its
first
steep
grade
when
a
youth
ran
from
the
and
attempted
to
leap
aboard
the
smoker
missing
the
step
he
fell
between
two
cars
though
still
clutching
a
of
the
one
he
had
attempted
to
board
with
cries
of
horror
several
of
those
who
witnessed
the
incident
from
the
station
platform
averted
their
faces
unwilling
to
view
the
ghastly
tragedy
that
they
believed
must
occur
in
another
instant
at
sound
of
their
cries
a
neatly
dressed
young
fellow
and
of
splendid
physique
who
was
in
the
act
of
mounting
the
turned
and
instantly
comprehended
the
situation
without
a
moment
of
hesitation
he
dropped
the
bag
he
was
carrying
and
flung
his
body
over
the
catching
at
its
supporting
stanchions
with
his
knees
in
this
position
with
his
arms
stretched
to
their
utmost
he
managed
to
grasp
the
of
the
unfortunate
youth
who
was
being
dragged
to
his
death
in
another
moment
he
had
by
a
supreme
effort
lifted
the
latter
bodily
to
the
platform
those
who
witnessed
this
superb
exhibition
of
promptly
applied
strength
from
the
station
platform
gave
a
cheer
as
the
train
swept
by
but
their
voices
were
drowned
in
its
clatter
and
the
two
actors
in
their
thrilling
drama
were
unaware
that
it
had
been
noticed
the
rescued
youth
sat
limp
and
motionless
on
the
swaying
platform
where
he
had
been
placed
dazed
by
the
suddenness
and
intensity
of
his
recent
terror
while
the
other
leaned
against
the
recovering
from
his
tremendous
effort
after
a
few
minutes
of
quick
breathing
he
pulled
himself
together
and
helped
his
companion
into
the
car
where
they
found
a
vacant
seat
a
few
of
the
passengers
noted
the
entrance
of
two
young
men
one
of
whom
seemed
to
be
in
need
of
the
other
assistance
and
glanced
at
them
with
meaning
smiles
there
had
been
races
at
hancock
that
day
and
they
evidently
believed
that
these
two
had
attended
them
no
one
spoke
to
them
however
and
it
quickly
became
apparent
that
the
supremest
moment
in
the
life
of
one
of
the
two
which
would
also
have
been
his
last
on
earth
but
for
the
other
had
passed
unnoticed
by
any
of
the
scores
of
human
beings
in
closest
proximity
to
them
at
the
time
it
was
hard
to
realize
this
and
for
a
few
minutes
the
young
men
sat
in
silence
dreading
but
expecting
to
be
overwhelmed
with
a
clamor
of
questions
it
was
a
relief
to
find
that
they
were
to
be
unmolested
and
when
the
conductor
had
passed
on
after
punching
their
tickets
the
one
who
had
rescued
the
other
turned
to
him
with
a
smile
saying
no
one
knows
anything
about
it
for
which
let
us
be
grateful
you
can
bet
i
grateful
mister
in
more
ways
than
one
answered
the
other
his
eyes
filling
with
the
tears
of
a
deep
emotion
as
he
spoke
i
wo
forget
in
a
hurry
that
you
saved
my
life
and
from
this
time
on
if
ever
you
can
make
any
use
of
so
poor
a
chap
as
me
i
your
man
my
name
tom
trefethen
and
i
live
in
red
jacket
where
i
run
a
compressor
for
no
shaft
of
the
white
pine
mine
that
all
there
is
to
me
for
i
never
done
anything
else
do
know
anything
else
and
expect
i
no
good
anything
else
so
you
see
i
hai
got
much
to
offer
in
exchange
for
what
you
just
give
me
same
time
i
your
friend
all
right
from
this
minute
and
i
would
do
a
thing
for
you
only
just
what
you
say
but
that
goes
every
time
that
all
right
tom
and
do
you
worry
about
trying
to
make
any
return
for
the
service
i
have
been
able
to
render
you
i
wo
call
it
a
slight
service
because
to
do
so
would
be
to
undervalue
the
life
i
was
permitted
to
save
besides
you
have
already
repaid
me
by
giving
me
a
friend
which
was
the
thing
of
which
i
stood
in
greatest
need
and
had
almost
despaired
of
gaining
why
mister
peveril
interrupted
the
other
richard
peveril
is
my
name
though
the
friends
i
used
to
have
generally
called
me
peril
used
to
have
peril
do
you
mean
by
that
that
you
hai
got
any
friends
now
i
mean
that
five
minutes
ago
it
did
not
seem
as
though
i
had
a
friend
in
the
world
but
now
i
have
one
who
i
hope
will
prove
a
very
valuable
one
as
well
and
his
name
is
tom
trefethen
it
good
of
you
to
say
so
peril
though
how
a
poor
ignorant
chap
like
me
can
prove
a
valuable
friend
to
a
swell
like
you
is
more
than
i
can
make
out
at
this
the
other
smiled
i
do
know
just
what
you
mean
by
a
swell
he
said
but
i
suppose
you
mean
a
gentleman
of
wealth
and
leisure
if
so
i
certainly
am
no
more
of
a
swell
than
you
nor
so
much
for
i
have
just
expended
my
last
dollar
for
this
railroad
ticket
and
have
no
idea
where
i
shall
get
another
in
fact
i
do
not
know
where
i
shall
obtain
a
supper
or
find
a
for
and
think
it
extremely
probable
that
i
shall
go
without
either
i
hope
very
much
though
to
find
a
job
of
work
that
will
provide
me
with
both
food
and
shelter
for
the
immediate
future
work
are
you
looking
for
work
asked
tom
gazing
at
peveril
natty
and
speaking
with
a
tone
of
incredulity
that
is
what
i
have
come
to
this
country
to
look
for
was
the
smiling
answer
i
came
here
because
i
was
told
that
this
was
the
one
section
of
the
united
states
unaffected
by
hard
times
and
because
i
had
a
letter
of
introduction
to
a
gentleman
in
hancock
whom
i
thought
would
assist
me
in
getting
a
position
to
my
great
disappointment
he
had
left
town
to
be
gone
for
several
months
and
as
i
could
not
afford
to
await
his
return
i
applied
for
work
at
the
quincy
and
other
mines
only
to
be
refused
is
it
work
in
the
mines
you
are
looking
for
asked
tom
trefethen
evidently
doubting
if
he
had
heard
aright
yes
that
or
any
other
by
which
i
can
make
an
honest
living
well
sir
i
would
have
believed
it
if
any
one
but
yourself
had
told
me
but
you
must
believe
it
for
it
is
true
and
i
am
now
on
my
way
to
red
jacket
because
i
have
been
told
there
is
more
work
to
be
had
there
than
at
any
other
place
in
the
whole
copper
region
or
in
the
state
for
that
matter
and
more
people
to
do
it
too
muttered
tom
trefethen
as
he
sank
into
a
by
this
time
the
train
had
climbed
from
the
muddy
level
of
portage
lake
which
with
its
recently
cut
bisects
keweenaw
point
making
of
its
upper
end
an
island
and
was
speeding
northward
over
a
rough
upland
its
way
led
through
a
naked
country
of
rocks
and
scrub
for
the
primitive
growth
of
timber
had
been
stripped
for
use
in
the
mines
every
now
and
then
it
passed
tall
and
chimneys
belching
forth
thick
volumes
of
smoke
which
with
their
clustering
villages
marked
the
sites
of
finally
as
darkness
began
to
shroud
the
uninteresting
landscape
the
train
entered
the
environs
of
a
and
populous
community
where
huge
mine
buildings
reared
themselves
from
surrounding
acres
of
the
small
but
comfortable
dwellings
of
miners
everywhere
shone
electric
lights
and
everywhere
was
a
swarming
population
peveril
gazed
from
his
car
window
in
astonishment
what
place
is
this
he
asked
red
jacket
answered
his
companion
that
is
it
is
red
jacket
blue
jacket
yellow
jacket
stone
pipe
osceola
white
pine
and
several
other
mining
villages
bunched
together
and
holding
in
all
about
thousand
people
whew
and
i
expected
to
find
a
place
of
not
over
one
thousand
inhabitants
you
do
know
much
about
the
copper
country
that
a
fact
said
tom
trefethen
with
the
slight
air
of
superiority
that
residents
of
a
place
are
so
apt
to
assume
towards
strangers
why
a
single
company
here
employs
as
many
as
three
thousand
men
i
am
willing
to
admit
my
ignorance
rejoined
peveril
but
i
am
also
very
anxious
to
learn
things
and
hope
in
course
of
time
to
rank
as
a
miner
therefore
any
information
you
can
give
me
will
be
gratefully
received
to
begin
with
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
the
name
of
some
hotel
where
my
grip
will
serve
as
security
for
a
few
board
and
lodging
a
hotel
peril
you
ca
be
feeling
so
very
poor
if
you
are
thinking
of
going
to
a
hotel
or
perhaps
you
do
know
how
expensive
our
red
jacket
hotels
are
you
see
there
is
always
such
a
rush
of
business
here
that
prices
are
way
up
why
they
do
think
anything
of
charging
two
dollars
a
day
and
they
get
it
too
do
give
you
anything
extra
in
the
way
of
grub
either
i
can
do
lots
better
than
that
for
you
though
there
of
here
fix
you
up
in
great
shape
for
five
a
week
you
just
wait
here
at
the
station
a
few
minutes
while
i
go
and
look
up
one
that
i
know
of
without
waiting
for
a
reply
tom
trefethen
hurried
from
the
train
which
was
just
coming
to
a
stop
at
the
bustling
red
jacket
station
and
disappeared
in
the
crowd
of
spectators
who
had
gathered
to
witness
its
arrival
peveril
followed
more
slowly
and
depositing
the
handsome
case
that
he
had
learned
to
call
a
grip
in
a
vacant
corner
of
the
platform
prepared
to
await
the
return
of
his
only
acquaintance
in
all
that
community
or
in
the
whole
state
of
michigan
so
far
as
i
know
reflected
the
young
man
as
for
friends
i
wonder
if
i
have
any
anywhere
this
tom
trefethen
claims
to
have
a
friendly
feeling
towards
me
and
if
he
comes
back
i
will
try
to
believe
in
him
it
is
more
than
likely
though
that
his
leaving
me
here
is
only
a
way
of
escaping
an
irksome
obligation
and
i
should
be
one
bit
surprised
never
to
see
him
again
it
seems
to
be
the
way
of
the
world
that
if
you
place
a
fellow
under
an
obligation
he
begins
to
dislike
you
from
that
moment
my
if
all
the
fellows
whom
i
have
helped
would
only
pay
what
they
owe
me
how
well
fixed
i
should
be
at
this
minute
i
could
even
put
up
with
a
clear
conscience
at
one
of
tom
trefethen
hotels
what
an
unsophisticated
chap
he
is
anyway
wonder
what
he
would
say
to
the
waldorf
charges
and
yet
only
a
short
time
ago
i
thought
them
very
moderate
it
a
queer
old
world
and
a
fellow
has
to
see
all
sides
of
it
before
he
can
form
an
idea
of
what
it
is
really
like
i
must
confess
however
that
i
am
not
particularly
enjoying
my
present
point
of
view
must
be
because
i
am
so
infernally
hungry
odd
sensation
and
so
decidedly
unpleasant
that
if
my
friend
with
the
cornish
name
does
return
inside
of
two
minutes
more
i
shall
abandon
our
tryst
and
set
forth
in
search
of
a
supper
at
this
point
in
his
dismal
reflections
peveril
became
aware
of
a
short
solidly
built
man
having
a
grizzled
beard
and
wearing
a
rough
suit
of
clothing
who
was
standing
squarely
before
him
and
regarding
him
intently
as
their
eyes
met
the
asked
abruptly
be
thy
name
richard
lad
yes
what
part
of
it
peveril
and
may
i
inquire
why
you
ask
because
lad
in
all
thee
has
not
a
truer
friend
nor
one
more
ready
to
serve
thee
than
old
mark
trefethen
so
come
along
of
me
and
gi
me
a
chance
to
prove
my
words
chapter

peveril

record
are
you
the
father
of
tom
trefethen
asked
peveril
of
the
man
who
had
so
abruptly
introduced
himself
certain
i
be
lad
feyther
to
the
young
fool
who
but
for
thee
would
never
have
come
home
to
us
no
more
his
mother
was
that
upset
by
thought
of
his
danger
that
she
could
let
him
leave
her
and
so
bade
me
come
to
fetch
you
mysel
not
that
i
needed
a
bidding
for
doubly
proud
of
a
chance
to
serve
the
man
who
gied
us
back
our
tom
so
come
along

to
where
there
a
hearty
welcome
waiting
togither
with
a
bite
and
a
bed

trefethen
i
ca
allow
you
to

you
must
allow
me
for
i
no

besides
i
never
dare
go
back
to

without
you
this
thy
grip
with
this
the
brawny
miner
swung
peveril
bag
to
his
shoulder
and
started
briskly
down
the
station
platform
followed
closely
by
the
young
man
who
but
a
moment
before
had
believed
himself
to
be
without
a
friend
they
had
not
gone
more
than
a
block
from
the
station
and
peveril
was
wondering
at
the
crowds
of
folk
who
thronged
the
wooden
sidewalks
as
well
as
at
the
rows
of
brilliantly
lighted
shops
when
his
guide
turned
abruptly
into
the
door
of
a
saloon
following
curiously
the
young
man
also
entered
and
passing
behind
a
latticed
screen
found
himself
in
a
long
room
having
a
sanded
floor
and
furnished
with
a
glittering
bar
tables
chairs
and
several
machines
the
nature
of
which
he
did
not
understand
several
men
were
leaning
against
the
counter
of
the
bar
but
without
noticing
them
other
than
by
a
general
nod
of
recognition
mark
trefethen
walked
to
the
far
end
of
the
room
where
he
deposited
peveril
bag
on
the
floor
beside
one
of
the
machines
already
mentioned
it
was
a
narrow
upright
frame
placed
close
to
the
wall
and
holding
a
stout
wooden
panel
in
the
centre
of
this
at
the
height
of
a
chest
was
a
stuffed
leathern
pad
on
which
was
painted
a
grotesque
face
evidently
intended
for
that
of
a
negro
and
above
it
was
a
dial
bearing
numbers
that
ranged
from
to
the
single
pointer
on
this
dial
indicated
the
number
a
figure
at
which
mark
trefethen
sniffed
contemptuously
let
see
thee
take
a
lick
at
lad
just
for
luck
he
said
although
he
had
never
before
seen
or
even
heard
of
such
a
machine
as
now
confronted
him
peveril
was
sufficiently
to
realize
that
his
companion
desired
him
to
strike
a
blow
with
his
fist
at
the
grinning
face
painted
on
the
leathern
pad
and
he
did
so
without
hesitation
at
the
same
time
as
he
had
no
idea
of
what
resistance
he
should
encounter
he
struck
out
rather
gingerly
and
the
sprang
back
to
mark
trefethen
looked
at
once
incredulous
and
disappointed
surely
that
not
thy
best
lick
lad
he
said
in
an
aggrieved
tone
why
old
as
i
am
i
could
better
it
mysel
thus
saying
the
miner
drew
back
a
fist
like
a
and
let
drive
a
blow
at
blacky
that
sent
the
pointer
up
to
now
lad
try
again
he
remarked
with
a
air
and
remember
what
i
should
have
telled
thee
afore
that
the
man
who
lets
pointer
slip
back
owes
beer
to
the
crowd
wondering
how
he
should
cancel
the
indebtedness
thus
innocently
incurred
and
also
at
the
strangeness
of
such
proceedings
on
the
part
of
one
who
had
just
invited
him
to
a
supper
peveril
again
stepped
up
and
delivered
a
nervous
blow
against
the
unresisting
leathern
pad
driving
the
pointer
to
the
miner
shout
of
well
done
lad
that
spunky
attracted
the
idlers
at
the
bar
and
brought
them
to
the
scene
of
contest
they
arrived
just
in
time
to
see
trefethen
deliver
his
second
blow
the
force
of
which
drove
the
sensitive
needle
six
points
farther
on
or
until
it
registered
with
a
flush
of
pride
on
his
strongly
marked
face
the
old
cornishman
exclaimed
there
a
mark
for
thee
lad
but
doa
strike
thee
can
better
it
for
i
like
it
to
stand
for
a
while
peveril
only
smiled
in
answer
and
taking
a
quick
forward
step
planted
so
vigorous
a
blow
upon
the
painted
leather
that
the
pointer
gained
a
single
interval
so
small
were
the
spaces
that
at
first
it
was
thought
not
to
have
moved
but
when
a
closer
examination
showed
it
to
indicate
a
murmur
of
approbation
went
up
from
the
spectators
mark
trefethen
said
not
a
word
but
throwing
off
his
coat
and
baring
his
corded
arm
for
a
mighty
effort
he
again
took
place
before
the
machine
carefully
measuring
his
distance
he
drew
back
and
delivered
a
blow
into
which
he
threw
the
whole
weight
of
his
body
as
though
galvanized
into
action
the
needle
leaped
up
four
points
and
registered
a
record
a
record
shouted
the
spectators
while
the
miner
turned
a
face
beaming
with
triumph
towards
his
athletic
young
antagonist
on
many
an
occasion
had
he
played
at
solitaire
fisticuffs
with
that
leathern
dummy
but
never
before
had
he
struck
it
such
a
mighty
blow
and
now
he
did
not
believe
that
another
in
all
red
jacket
could
equal
the
feat
he
had
just
performed
lat
it
stand
lad
lat
it
stand
he
said
but
in
a
tone
unmistakably
patronizing
you
done
enough
to
take
front
rank
for
not
more
than
three
men
in
all
the
jackets
have
ever
beat
your
figure
besides
the
beer
is
on
the
house
now
for
a
record
but
be
on
any
man
who
lowers
yon
so
best
lat
well
enough
alone
illustration
in
breathless
silence
the
group
watched
movements
this
advice
was
tendered
in
all
sincerity
and
was
doubtless
very
good
but
peveril
was
now
too
deeply
interested
in
the
novel
contest
to
accept
defeat
without
a
further
effort
besides
the
of
a
winning
crew
in
the
great
which
is
what
dick
peveril
had
been
only
two
months
earlier
was
not
accustomed
to
be
beaten
in
athletic
games
so
he
too
threw
off
his
coat
and
bared
the
glorious
right
arm
that
had
at
once
been
the
pride
of
his
college
and
the
envy
of
every
other
in
the
in
breathless
silence
the
little
group
of
spectators
watched
his
movements
and
when
with
sharply
exhaled
breath
he
planted
a
crashing
facer
straight
from
the
shoulder
squarely
upon
the
leathern
disk
they
sprang
eagerly
forward
to
note
the
result
for
an
instant
they
gazed
at
each
other
blankly
for
the
needle
though
trembling
violently
remained
fixedly
pointing
at
the
figure
then
they
realized
what
had
happened
mark
trefethen
score
had
been
neither
raised
nor
lowered
but
had
been
duplicated
a
double
record
had
been
established
and
that
in
a
single
contest
such
a
thing
had
never
before
happened
in
red
jacket
where
trials
of
strength
and
skill
similar
to
the
one
they
had
just
witnessed
were
of
frequent
occurrence
as
the
amazing
truth
broke
upon
them
they
raised
a
great
shout
of
applause
and
every
man
present
pressed
eagerly
about
the
two
champions
with
cordially
extended
hands
but
peveril
and
the
old
miner
were
already
shaking
hands
with
each
other
for
mark
trefethen
had
been
the
first
to
appreciate
the
result
of
his
opponent
blow
and
had
whirled
around
from
his
examination
of
the
dial
to
seize
the
young
man
hand
in
both
of
his
now
i
believe
it
lad
he
cried
now
i
believe
the
story
boy
tom
telled
this
night
i
could
make
it
seem
possible
that
you
had
lifted
him
as
he
said
and
so
i
wanted
proof
now
i
got
it
and
now
i
know
you
for
best
man
that
come
to
mines
for
many
a
year
pray
god
lad
that
you
and
me
never
have
a
quarrel
to
settle
wi
bare
fists
for
i
free
to
say
i
rayther
meet
any
ither
two
men
in
the
jackets
than
the
one
behind
the
fist
that
struck
yon
blow
you
will
never
meet
him
in
a
quarrel
if
i
can
help
it
trefethen
replied
peveril
flushing
with
gratified
pride
for
i
ca
imagine
anything
that
would
throw
me
into
a
greater
funk
than
to
face
as
an
enemy
the
man
who
established
the
existing
record
on
that
machine
but
now
do
you
think
we
might
adjourn
to
the
supper
of
which
you
spoke
awhile
since
i
was
never
quite
so
famished
in
my
life
and
am
nearly
ready
to
drop
with
the
exhaustion
of
hunger
oh
jimmy
groaned
one
of
the
listening
spectators
if
done
wot
did
hon
a
hempty
stummick
hit
the
man
or
the
machine
when
full
step
up
for
your
beers
gentlemen
cried
the
bartender
at
this
moment
the
house
owes
two
rounds
for
the
double
record
and
is
proud
to
pay
a
debt
so
handsomely
thrust
upon
it
this
invitation
was
promptly
accepted
by
the
spectators
of
the
recent
contest
all
of
whom
immediately
lined
up
at
the
bar
mark
trefethen
stood
with
them
and
when
he
noticed
that
peveril
held
back
he
called
out
heartily
step
up
lad
and
doa
be
bashful
we
waiting
to
take
a
mug
wi
thee
i
thank
you
all
rejoined
peveril
politely
but
i
believe
i
care
to
drink
anything
just
now
what
not
teetotal
not
wholly
replied
the
other
with
a
laugh
but
i
long
ago
made
it
a
rule
not
to
take
liquor
in
any
form
on
an
empty
stomach
oh
it
wo
hurt
you
and
this
time
need
count
anyway
said
one
of
the
men
whose
features
proclaimed
him
to
be
of
irish
birth
i
think
it
would
hurt
me
replied
peveril
and
if
my
rule
could
be
broken
at
this
time
of
course
it
could
at
any
other
so
i
believe
i
wo
drink
anything
thank
you
you
mane
you
a
snob
and
do
care
to
associate
with
retorted
the
other
i
mean
nothing
of
the
kind
but
exactly
what
i
said
that
i
propose
to
injure
my
health
to
gratify
you
or
any
other
man
as
for
associating
with
i
am
a
myself
and
have
come
to
this
place
with
the
hope
of
finding
a
job
in
one
of
the
mines
if
i
had
wanted
to
associate
with
i
should
be
here
at
this
minute
well

with
them
in
one
thing
if
not
in
all

rejoined
the
irishman
sneeringly
and
so
if
you
drink
with
us
you
ca
become
one
of
us
that
right
murmured
several
voices
moreover
continued
the
speaker
you

look

or
act
like
a
and
i
willing
to
bet
the
price
of
these
beers
that
you

life
if
i

trefethen

a
knotted

in
close
proximity
to
the
irishman
face
how

insult
the
friend

chapter
iii
a
stroke
strikes
adverse
fortune
richard
peveril
student
at
christ
church
was
not
only
one
of
the
most
popular
men
in
his
own
college
but
as
stroke
of
the
eight
was
becoming
one
of
the
best
known
of
oxford
undergraduates
when
the
blow
was
struck
that
compelled
him
to
leave
england
and
return
to
the
land
of
his
birth
without
even
waiting
to
try
for
his
degree
he
had
been
an
orphan
from
early
boyhood
and
under
the
nominal
care
of
a
guardian
who
saw
as
little
of
his
charge
as
possible
had
passed
most
of
his
time
in
american
until
sent
abroad
to
finish
his
education
while
his
guardian
had
never
been
unkind
to
him
he
had
not
tried
to
understand
the
boy
or
to
win
his
affection
but
had
placed
him
at
the
best
schools
supplied
him
liberally
with
and
then
let
him
alone
although
the
lad
had
thus
been
denied
the
softening
influence
of
a
home
the
tender
care
of
a
mother
and
a
father
counsel
his
had
trained
him
to
prompt
obedience
to
lawful
authority
a
strict
sense
of
honor
and
to
a
physical
condition
so
perfect
that
in
all
his
life
he
had
never
known
a
day
sickness
having
always
had
plenty
of
money
he
had
never
learned
its
value
though
in
his
his
allowance
had
been
limited
by
the
same
wise
rules
that
also
checked
undue
extravagance
thus
while
brought
up
to
live
and
spend
money
like
a
gentleman
he
had
not
been
permitted
to
acquire
vicious
habits
even
at
college
his
allowance
had
always
been
in
excess
of
his
needs
and
so
though
ever
ready
to
help
a
friend
in
trouble
he
had
never
run
into
debt
on
his
own
account
another
influence
for
good
was
the
lad
inherited
love
for
all
sports
and
he
could
not
remember
the
time
when
he
was
not
in
training
for
a
team
a
crew
or
an
athletic
event
of
some
kind
thus
the
keeping
of
regular
hours
together
with
a
studied
temperance
in
both
eating
and
drinking
had
been
grafted
into
his
very
nature
life
had
thus
been
made
very
pleasant
for
our
hero
and
believing
himself
to
be
heir
to
a
fortune
he
had
never
been
disturbed
by
anxieties
concerning
the
future
of
course
while
he
had
hosts
of
acquaintances
most
of
whom
called
themselves
his
friends
he
was
well
aware
that
some
of
them
were
envious
of
his
position
and
would
rejoice
at
his
downfall
should
such
an
event
ever
take
place
it
was
partly
this
knowledge
partly
his
own
sense
of
absolute
security
in
life
and
partly
a
habit
acquired
during
a
long
career
of
leadership
among
his
school
companions
that
rendered
him
brusque
with
those
for
whom
he
did
not
particularly
care
and
contemptuous
to
the
verge
of
rudeness
towards
such
persons
as
he
disliked
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
our
young
man
possessed
a
facility
for
the
making
of
enemies
as
well
as
friends
of
his
secret
enemies
the
most
bitter
was
a
also
an
american
named
owen
who
possessed
of
barely
means
enough
to
carry
him
through
college
and
with
no
prospects
had
by
relinquishing
everything
else
taken
much
the
same
stand
in
scholarship
that
peveril
had
in
athletics
as
a
consequence
each
was
envious
of
the
other
for
the
stroke
of
the
eight
was
so
little
of
a
student
that
he
had
never
more
than
barely
scraped
through
with
an
examination
in
his
life
and
was
always
overwhelmed
with
conditions
this
jealousy
would
not
however
have
led
to
enmity
without
a
further
cause
which
had
been
furnished
within
a
year
owen
had
crossed
on
a
steamer
with
maturin
bonnifay
of
new
york
and
her
only
daughter
rose
they
did
london
together
and
never
had
the
young
american
found
that
city
so
delightful
at
his
solicitation
the
bonnifays
consented
to
visit
oxford
and
permitted
him
to
act
as
their
escort
in
contemplating
the
pleasure
of
such
a
visit
owen
had
lost
sight
of
its
dangers
but
alas
for
his
happiness
they
became
only
too
quickly
apparent
the
ladies
must
be
taken
to
the
river
of
course
and
there
the
one
thing
above
all
others
to
see
was
the
eight
at
practice
of
the
entire
crew
none
attracted
such
instant
attention
as
the
and
when
they
learned
that
he
was
an
american
their
interest
in
him
was
doubled
of
course
he
and
owen
being
compatriots
in
a
strange
land
and
both
having
done
so
splendidly
at
the
dear
old
university
must
be
friends
oh
certainly
then
would
owen
present
his
friend
it
was
always
so
pleasant
to
meet
the
right
kind
of
americans
when
abroad
why
there
he
comes
now
i
am
sure
that
must
be
he
is
it
owen
though
one
does
look
so
different
in
a
boat
and
out
of
it
it
was
indeed
peveril
who
had
purposely
sauntered
in
that
direction
for
a
closer
view
of
the
pretty
girl
whom
dig
owen
of
all
men
had
picked
up
and
in
another
minute
owen
with
an
extremely
bad
grace
had
introduced
him
from
that
moment
as
is
always
the
case
when
athletes
and
scholars
compete
for
feminine
favor
the
scholar
was
almost
ignored
while
his
muscular
rival
was
petted
to
a
degree
that
owen
declared
simply
scandalous
although
the
latter
was
still
allowed
to
act
as
escort
to
the
ladies
and
form
a
fourth
in
their
various
excursions
it
was
always
peveril
who
walked
sat
strolled
and
talked
with
miss
rose
while
owen
was
monopolized
by
her
mother
the
bonnifays
had
only
intended
to
spend
a
day
or
two
in
oxford
but
the
place
proved
so
charmingly
attractive
that
they
remained
a
month
and
when
they
finally
took
their
departure
for
the
continent
miss
rose
wore
a
superb
diamond
ring
on
the
third
finger
of
her
left
hand
that
had
very
recently
been
placed
there
by
peveril
before
they
separated
it
had
been
arranged
that
he
and
they
should
travel
through
norway
together
during
the
following
summer
owen
had
also
been
invited
to
join
the
party
but
had
declined
on
the
ground
that
immediately
upon
taking
his
degree
he
would
be
obliged
to
return
to
america
so
that
winter
the
scholar
filled
with
envy
and
bitterness
ground
away
gloomily
but
persistently
at
his
books
while
the
athlete
radiant
with
happiness
steadily
cheerful
and
labored
with
his
crew
finally
he
stroked
them
to
a
win
on
the
thames
and
then
at
the
height
of
his
glory
began
to
consider
his
chances
for
a
degree
at
this
moment
the
blow
was
struck
and
it
came
in
the
shape
of
a
cablegram
from
a
new
york
law
firm
return
at
earliest
convenience
carson
dead
affairs
badly
involved
boise
carson
was
the
guardian
whom
peveril
had
so
seldom
seen
but
who
had
always
controlled
his
affairs
and
provided
so
liberally
for
all
his
wants
upon
coming
of
age
a
few
months
before
peveril
had
sent
over
a
power
of
attorney
and
his
had
continued
to
act
for
him
as
before
they
were
to
have
had
a
settlement
when
the
young
man
took
his
degree
for
which
purpose
he
had
planned
to
run
over
to
new
york
spend
a
few
days
there
and
return
in
time
for
his
norway
trip
with
the
bonnifays
in
the
autumn
he
and
they
would
sail
for
new
york
together
and
the
wedding
would
take
place
as
soon
thereafter
as
was
practicable
now
this
wretched
cablegram
promised
to
upset
everything
and
he
must
look
forward
to
spending
the
summer
in
trying
to
disentangle
an
involved
business
instead
of
spending
it
with
the
girl
of
his
heart
perhaps
though
badly
involved
did
not
mean
so
badly
and
possibly
he
might
get
through
with
the
hated
business
in
time
for
the
norway
trip
after
all
if
he
only
set
to
work
at
once
of
course
that
would
necessitate
the
giving
up
of
his
degree
but
what
difference
did
that
make
other
things
were
of
infinitely
more
importance
so
peveril
bade
farewell
to
oxford
wrote
a
long
letter
full
of
love
and
hopeful
promises
to
rose
bonnifay
at
rome
sent
her
a
reassuring
telegram
from
southampton
and
sailed
for
new
york
having
been
so
long
absent
he
found
very
few
friends
in
that
city
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
some
even
of
those
few
greeted
him
with
a
constraint
bordering
on
coldness
as
boise
carson
who
had
lived
and
died
a
bachelor
had
roomed
at
the
waldorf
peveril
also
established
himself
in
that
palatial
caravansary
and
was
then
ready
to
plunge
into
the
business
that
had
brought
him
to
america
his
first
shock
came
from
the
lawyer
who
had
summoned
him
and
who
at
once
told
him
that
he
feared
everything
was
lost
i
do
exactly
understand
what
you
mean
said
peveril
in
plain
terms
then
i
am
afraid
that
your
late
guardian
not
only
squandered
his
own
fortune
in
unwise
speculation
but
yours
as
well
perhaps
this
note
left
for
you
will
explain
the
situation
thus
saying
the
lawyer
handed
peveril
a
sealed
envelope
addressed
to
him
in
the
handwriting
of
boise
carson
tearing
it
open
the
young
man
read
as
follows
my
dear
richard
having
lost
everything
including
your
fortune
and
my
own
honor
i
have
no
longer
an
object
in
living
i
therefore
conclude
that
it
will
be
best
to
efface
myself
as
speedily
as
possible
i
have
made
a
will
leaving
you
my
sole
heir
and
executor
you
are
welcome
to
whatever
you
can
save
from
the
wreck
all
papers
belonging
to
your
father
and
left
in
my
charge
will
be
handed
you
by
ketchum
yours
for
the
last
time
boise
carson
he
did
commit
suicide
exclaimed
peveril
incredulously
it
is
to
be
feared
that
he
did
replied
the
lawyer
and
the
state
of
his
affairs
bears
out
the
supposition
after
this
peveril
spent
a
month
in
new
york
trying
to
recover
something
from
the
wreck
of
his
fortune
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
found
himself
with
less
than
one
hundred
dollars
over
and
above
his
obligations
realizing
at
length
that
he
must
for
the
future
depend
entirely
upon
his
own
efforts
he
made
several
applications
for
vacant
positions
in
the
city
only
to
find
in
every
case
that
they
were
also
sought
by
men
more
competent
to
fill
them
than
he
one
day
when
for
want
of
something
better
to
do
he
was
mechanically
looking
over
a
package
of
old
papers
that
had
belonged
to
his
father
he
came
across
a
contract
of
partnership
between
his
parent
and
a
certain
ralph
darrell
it
was
for
the
opening
and
development
of
a
mine
to
be
known
as
the
copper
princess
and
located
in
the
upper
peninsula
of
michigan
by
the
terms
of
the
contract
the
partnership
was
to
exist
for
twenty
years
and
if
either
party
died
during
that
time
his
heir
or
heirs
were
to
accept
the
liabilities
and
receive
all
benefits
accruing
to
an
original
partner
it
was
however
provided
that
the
claims
of
such
heirs
must
be
made
before
expiration
of
the
contract
otherwise
the
entire
property
would
fall
into
possession
of
the
partner
or
his
heirs
the
document
bore
a
date
nineteen
years
old
well
said
peveril
reflectively
as
he
finished
reading
this
paper
although
everything
else
is
lost
it
would
seem
that
as
my
sole
heir
i
am
still
in
a
copper
mine
i
wonder
if
it
is
worth
looking
up
chapter
iv
starting
in
search
of
the
copper
princess
viewed
through
the
sanguine
eyes
of
youth
the
possession
of
a
in
a
copper
mine
seemed
to
offer
a
ready
solution
of
peveril
recent
difficulties
he
vaguely
recalled
stories
of
great
fortunes
made
in
copper
and
speculated
concerning
the
market
value
of
his
newly
discovered
property
there
must
be
plenty
of
people
ready
to
buy
such
things
if
they
are
only
offered
cheaply
enough
he
said
to
himself
and
heaven
knows
i
would
hold
out
for
any
fancy
price
ten
thousand
dollars
or
even
five
would
be
sufficient
for
the
norway
trip
and
after
that
something
would
be
certain
to
turn
up
of
all
his
trials
none
had
seemed
so
hard
to
bear
as
the
giving
up
of
that
journey
to
norway
and
now
it
might
be
accomplished
after
all
he
had
written
several
letters
to
rose
since
reaching
new
york
and
at
first
they
had
been
filled
with
hopes
of
a
speedy
reunion
then
as
he
began
to
realize
the
condition
of
his
fortunes
they
became
less
frequent
and
less
hopeful
until
for
some
weeks
not
knowing
what
to
write
he
had
not
written
at
all
now
filled
with
a
new
courage
he
wrote
a
long
and
cheerful
letter
in
which
he
stated
a
belief
that
his
business
troubles
were
so
nearly
ended
that
he
would
speedily
be
able
to
join
his
friends
in
norway
this
letter
finished
and
mailed
the
young
visited
his
lawyer
to
inform
him
of
his
discovery
and
learn
its
probable
value
ketchum
smiled
grimly
as
he
glanced
at
the
contract
on
which
peveril
was
building
such
high
hopes
and
then
handing
it
back
said
pityingly
my
dear
boy
i
hate
to
dash
your
hopes
but
i
doubt
if
this
thing
is
worth
anything
more
than
the
paper
on
which
it
is
written
boise
carson
brought
it
to
us
years
ago
and
we
looked
into
it
at
that
time
we
discovered
that
a
property
located
somewhere
in
northern
michigan
and
supposed
to
be
rich
in
copper
had
been
purchased
at
a
stiff
price
by
your
father
and
this
ralph
darrell
who
was
a
banker
in
one
of
the
new
england
cities
boston
i
believe
they
christened
it
the
princess
invested
nearly
a
million
dollars
in
a
complete
and
sank
a
shaft
into
barren
rock
not
one
cent
did
the
mine
ever
yield
and
the
deeper
they
went
the
poorer
became
their
prospects
finally
darrell
completely
ruined
financially
became
crazed
by
his
troubles
and
disappeared
nor
has
he
ever
been
heard
from
since
your
father
having
put
half
of
his
fortune
into
the
venture
brooded
over
its
loss
until
his
death
which
i
am
convinced
was
largely
caused
by
the
failure
of
the
copper
princess
what
became
of
the
property
after
that
asked
peveril
who
had
listened
with
a
sinking
heart
to
this
recital
i
believe
it
stands
as
it
was
abandoned
years
ago
one
of
the
many
monuments
of
ruined
hopes
in
that
country
of
squandered
fortunes
but
there
is
copper
in
that
region
is
there
not
certainly
there
is
and
in
fabulous
quantity
but
apparently
not
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
copper
princess
did
you
visit
the
place
yourself
no
we
conducted
our
inquiries
through
a
of
hancock
which
was
at
that
time
the
nearest
town
of
importance
to
the
property
does
your
correspondent
still
live
there
i
believe
so
at
any
rate
he
did
within
a
year
will
you
give
me
a
note
of
introduction
to
him
and
also
a
paper
of
identification
by
which
i
may
substantiate
my
claim
to
a
in
the
copper
princess
certainly
i
will
but
may
i
ask
how
you
propose
to
use
such
documents
you
surely
do
not
intend
to
visit
the
property
with
the
hope
that
anything
can
be
realized
from
it
i
do
think
i
have
much
hope
of
any
kind
just
now
replied
peveril
bitterly
but
i
suppose
there
is
as
much
work
to
be
done
in
the
copper
country
as
anywhere
else
while
my
chances
of
obtaining
employment
there
will
at
least
be
as
good
as
they
are
here
besides
it
will
be
a
sort
of
satisfaction
to
gaze
upon
the
only
existing
evidence
that
there
ever
was
a
fortune
in
the
family
you
said
that
buildings
of
some
sort
had
been
erected
on
the
property
did
you
not
yes
according
to
my
recollection
there
was
quite
a
village
of
miners
houses
besides
all
the
other
necessary
structures
then
i
may
at
least
discover
a
roof
under
which
i
can
dwell
rent
free
while
the
sensation
of
finding
myself
lord
of
a
manor
will
be
decidedly
novel
having
thus
decided
upon
a
course
of
action
our
young
lost
no
time
in
carrying
out
his
newly
formed
plans
that
very
afternoon
he
purchased
a
ticket
for
buffalo
from
which
point
he
proposed
to
economize
his
slender
resources
by
taking
a
lake
steamer
to
his
point
of
destination
his
last
duty
before
leaving
new
york
and
the
one
from
which
he
shrank
most
was
the
writing
of
a
second
letter
to
rose
telling
her
that
the
trip
to
norway
was
no
longer
a
possibility
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
he
wrote
i
am
suddenly
confronted
with
the
necessity
of
taking
rather
a
long
western
journey
to
investigate
the
condition
of
a
mine
in
which
i
own
a
i
hate
to
go
because
every
mile
will
lengthen
the
distance
between
us
and
am
more
bitterly
disappointed
than
i
can
express
at
being
compelled
to
give
up
our
norwegian
trip
but
my
call
to
the
west
is
imperative
and
must
be
obeyed
so
dear
let
us
bear
our
disappointment
as
best
we
can
for
i
hope
it
is
one
to
you
as
well
as
to
me
and
look
forward
to
a
joyful
reunion
in
this
city
next
autumn
the
epistle
of
which
the
above
is
but
a
fragment
not
only
caused
miss
bonnifay
to
utter
an
impatient
exclamation
as
she
read
it
but
also
led
to
complications
feeling
that
with
peveril
safely
across
the
atlantic
there
might
be
some
hope
for
him
owen
had
reconsidered
his
determination
not
to
go
to
norway
and
had
written
from
oxford
offering
to
escort
the
ladies
on
that
trip
his
letter
reached
them
in
company
with
that
from
peveril
announcing
that
he
too
would
shortly
be
with
them
thereupon
bonnifay
replied
to
owen
that
while
they
should
be
delighted
to
have
him
join
their
party
he
must
not
inconvenience
himself
to
do
so
as
peveril
business
was
in
such
shape
that
he
would
be
able
to
carry
out
his
original
intention
of
accompanying
them
then
came
peveril
second
letter
stating
that
he
could
not
leave
america
after
all
and
the
elder
lady
hurriedly
penned
the
following
note
my
dear
owen
we
are
so
glad
that
you
can
accompany
us
to
norway
the
more
so
that
peveril
will
after
all
be
prevented
from
so
doing
he
has
just
written
that
business
of
the
utmost
importance
connected
with
an
immensely
valuable
mine
that
he
owns
somewhere
in
the
west
will
prevent
his
leaving
america
this
summer
of
course
he
is
in
despair
and
all
that
while
we
are
awfully
sorry
for
him
but
we
shall
not
allow
our
grief
to
interfere
in
the
least
with
the
pleasure
we
are
anticipating
from
a
trip
to
norway
under
your
escort
hoping
then
to
see
you
here
very
soon
i
remain
etc
quickly
as
this
letter
followed
its
immediate
predecessor
it
arrived
too
late
to
accomplish
its
purpose
for
on
the
very
day
that
he
received
it
owen
had
cabled
his
acceptance
of
a
position
offered
him
in
the
united
states
and
procured
his
ticket
for
new
york
was
ever
a
man
so
cursed
by
fate
he
cried
as
he
finished
reading
bonnifay
note
or
rather
by
the
stupidity
of
a
blundering
idiot
i
do
believe
dick
peveril
cares
a
rap
for
the
girl
if
he
did
he
would
not
desert
her
on
any
such
flimsy
pretext
the
idea
of
his
having
business
with
a
mine
he
never
did
have
any
business
and
never
will
how
i
hate
the
fellow
with
this
owen
composed
a
letter
to
bonnifay
in
which
his
regrets
at
the
miscarriage
of
their
plans
were
skilfully
interwoven
with
insinuations
that
possibly
peveril
had
found
america
to
hold
even
greater
attractions
than
norway
he
also
promised
to
keep
them
informed
concerning
the
latest
new
york
news
this
promise
he
redeemed
two
weeks
later
by
forwarding
whatever
of
gossip
he
could
gather
regarding
peveril
it
included
the
information
that
the
latter
had
not
only
lost
his
fortune
but
had
sought
so
unsuccessfully
for
employment
in
the
city
that
he
had
finally
been
obliged
to
leave
it
and
no
one
knew
whither
he
had
gone
having
accomplished
this
piece
of
work
owen
also
departed
from
new
york
and
turned
his
face
westward
in
the
mean
time
peveril
happily
unconscious
of
these
several
epistles
was
finding
his
own
path
beset
by
trials
such
as
he
had
never
encountered
on
any
previous
journey
for
they
were
those
caused
by
a
scarcity
of
funds
with
which
to
meet
his
expenses
his
determination
to
economize
failed
because
of
his
ignorance
of
the
first
principles
of
economy
besides
that
his
appearance
his
manner
his
dress
and
his
personal
belongings
were
all
so
many
protests
against
economy
thus
when
he
inquired
concerning
a
hotel
in
buffalo
no
one
thought
of
naming
any
save
the
most
expensive
and
he
drove
to
it
in
a
carriage
because
he
did
not
know
how
else
to
reach
it
then
it
happened
that
the
first
boat
leaving
for
the
superior
country
was
the
one
of
the
most
luxurious
and
extravagant
of
lake
craft
to
be
sure
she
was
also
the
swiftest
and
would
carry
him
through
without
loss
of
time
but
when
he
left
her
at
the
sault
as
he
found
he
must
in
order
to
reach
the
copper
country
his
scanty
stock
of
money
was
depleted
beyond
anything
he
had
deemed
possible
on
so
short
a
trip
from
the
sault
he
travelled
by
rail
and
finally
reached
hancock
with
but
five
dollars
in
his
pocket
then
failing
to
find
the
only
person
to
whom
he
had
a
note
of
introduction
and
also
being
unable
to
obtain
work
he
finally
expended
his
last
dollar
for
transportation
to
red
jacket
where
he
knew
he
must
either
find
employment
or
starve
and
thus
was
our
hero
led
to
the
point
at
which
we
first
made
his
acquaintance
chapter
v
the
trefethens
as
peveril
walked
with
his
newly
made
acquaintance
through
the
brisk
of
whose
very
name
he
had
been
ignorant
until
that
day
mark
trefethen
directed
his
attention
to
its
various
places
and
objects
of
interest
of
one
small
but
handsome
stone
building
surrounded
by
grass
and
he
said
there
where
the
swells
get
their
beer
peveril
instantly
knew
it
for
a
and
with
a
pang
of
regret
for
the
lost
comforts
of
such
an
establishment
glanced
enviously
at
its
cosey
interior
disclosed
through
open
windows
at
length
they
reached
the
modest
cottage
built
on
the
plan
of
a
hundred
others
that
mark
trefethen
rented
from
the
company
and
called
his
home
the
room
into
which
peveril
was
ushered
was
scrupulously
clean
and
neat
but
seemed
to
him
painfully
bare
and
cheerless
it
was
lighted
by
a
single
unshaded
lamp
that
stood
in
the
middle
of
an
table
laid
for
supper
half
a
dozen
cheap
wooden
chairs
and
a
of
inferior
grade
completed
its
furnishing
the
had
only
time
for
a
single
glance
at
these
things
as
he
entered
the
door
before
his
recent
acquaintance
of
the
train
who
now
seemed
almost
like
an
old
friend
sprang
forward
with
outstretched
hand
exclaiming
i
so
glad
you
come
for
i
was
afraid
father
might
not
find
you
or
you
might
get
tired
of
waiting
or
that
something
might
have
happened
to
take
you
some
other
place
i
would
have
gone
back
myself
only
father
would
have
it
that
way
and
claimed
was
his
place
to
fetch
you
surely
son
and
why
not
could
i
do
less
than
give
the
first
welcome
to
one
who
has
done
for
us
what
peril
has
mother
take
a
step
and
shake
hands
wi
him
who
saved
our
boy
to
us
this
day
i
believe
it
till
i
seen
him
hit
such
a
blow
as
but
one
other
in
all
red
jacket
has
ever
struck
what
do
you
think
of
one
for
a
record
oh
father
you
surely
did
take
him
but
tom
words
were
lost
in
the
heartfelt
though
somewhat
trying
greeting
that
peveril
was
at
that
moment
receiving
from
trefethen
she
was
a
large
woman
whose
ample
form
was
unconfined
by
stay
or
lace
and
with
whom
to
take
a
step
was
evidently
an
exertion
that
she
was
also
of
an
emotional
nature
was
shown
by
the
tears
that
rolled
in
little
channels
down
her
cheeks
as
she
made
an
elephantine
courtesy
before
her
guest
mister
peril
sir
she
said
in
a
voice
that
seemed
to
bubble
up
through
an
overflow
of
tears
may
you
never
hexperience
the
feelinks
of
a
mother
more
especial
the
mother
of
a
honly
son
which
is
no
name
for
them
as
i
were
saying
to

mark
trefethen
let
have
supper
you
done
yourself
proud
mother
and
give
peril
a
but
eating
before
talking
say
i
and
so
let
us
fall
to
faint
with
hunger
as
he
was
the
guest
needed
no
second
invitation
to
seat
himself
at
the
homely
but
hospitable
table
on
which
was
placed
a
great
dish
of
corned
beef
and
cabbage
another
of
potatoes
a
wheaten
loaf
and
a
pot
of
tea
cups
plates
and
saucers
were
of
thickest
knives
and
forks
were
of
iron
and
spoons
were
of
pewter
but
peveril
managed
to
make
successful
use
of
them
all
and
though
betraying
a
woful
ignorance
of
the
proper
functions
of
a
knife
ate
his
first
meal
with
all
of
a
appetite
and
hearty
appreciation
trefethen
occupied
a
great
at
one
end
of
the
table
surrounded
by
a
group
of
clamorous
little
ones
into
whose
open
mouths
she
dropped
bits
of
food
as
though
they
were
so
many
young
birds
in
a
nest
and
kept
up
an
unceasing
flow
of
conversation
regarding
her
friend
penny
to
which
peveril
strove
to
pay
polite
attention
from
the
opposite
end
her
husband
expatiated
between
mouthfuls
upon
the
fate
that
had
overtaken
that
evening
but
peveril
was
too
hungry
to
talk
and
so
apparently
was
tom
these
four
were
waited
on
by
a
slim
lass
with
demure
expression
but
laughing
eyes
to
whom
the
guest
had
not
been
introduced
but
who
from
her
likeness
to
tom
he
rightly
concluded
must
be
his
sister
she
was
addressed
as
nelly
after
supper
the
three
men
adjourned
to
a
little
front
porch
where
mark
trefethen
lighted
a
pipe
and
questioned
peveril
concerning
his
plans
for
the
future
after
listening
attentively
to
all
that
his
guest
chose
to
tell
of
himself
he
said
it
plain
lad
thee
not
been
brought
up
to
work
and
knows
nought
of
mining
but
thee
got
head
to
learn
and
muscle
to
work
with
so
if
wants
job
thee
shall
have
it
or
mark
trefethen
know
why
now
i
tell
what
bide
along
of
us
and
be
certain
of
welcome
take
to
look
about
and
by
night
i
have
news
for
you
gratefully
accepting
this
invitation
the
oxford
undergraduate
slept
that
night
in
a
tiny
chamber
of
the
trefethen
cottage
from
which
he
shrewdly
suspected
miss
nelly
had
been
turned
out
to
make
room
for
him
the
next
day
he
went
with
his
friends
to
the
mine
where
in
the
dry
he
saw
the
underground
laborers
change
into
their
then
he
watched
them
clamber
a
dozen
at
a
time
into
the
great
and
disappear
with
startling
suddenness
down
the
black
shaft
into
unknown
depths
of
darkness
after
all
were
gone
he
spent
some
time
in
the
of
the
with
tom
who
was
there
on
duty
the
remainder
of
the
day
he
passed
in
wandering
among
and
shops
making
close
observations
asking
questions
and
gaining
a
deal
of
information
concerning
the
mining
of
copper
that
evening
mark
trefethen
told
him
that
he
had
made
arrangements
by
which
he
could
if
he
chose
go
to
work
in
the
mine
the
following
morning
job
wi
timber
gang
lad
he
said
in
bottom
level

work
and
little
pay

first

the
day
but
if

for
it
job

am

any
rate

the
young
man
gratefully
and
will
also
try
my
best
to
prevent
you
from
being
ashamed
of
me
no
fear

only
fear

i
be
proud
of
thee

peveril
who

the
money

and
i
rig

proper
so
peveril
was
taken
to
the
company
store
where
with
mark
trefethen
to
vouch
for
him
he
was
allowed
to
purchase
on
credit
two
shirts
a
suit
of
brown
canvas
a
pair
of
heavy
hobnailed
shoes
two
pairs
of
woollen
socks
a
hard
hat
a
and
a
miner
lamp
as
these
things
were
by
order
of
the
timber
boss
charged
to
dick
peril
that
was
the
name
under
which
our
young
oxonian
began
his
new
life
and
became
known
in
the
strange
community
to
which
erratic
fortune
had
led
him
on
the
following
morning
he
sallied
forth
from
the
trefethen
cottage
with
a
tin
on
one
arm
his
under
the
other
and
uncomfortably
conscious
that
he
was
curiously
regarded
by
every
person
whom
he
met
on
his
way
to
the
mine
as
the
dry
was
already
overcrowded
he
shared
tom
locker
and
was
grateful
for
the
opportunity
of
changing
his
clothing
in
the
comparative
seclusion
of
the
rather
than
in
company
with
the
two
hundred
men
who
thronged
the
building
devoted
especially
to
that
purpose
having
assumed
his
new
garments
and
feeling
very
awkward
in
them
peveril
made
his
way
to
the
there
he
was
joined
by
mark
trefethen
who
regarded
the
change
made
in
his
protégé
appearance
with
approving
eyes
together
and
in
company
with
a
stream
of
men
talking
in
a
bewildering
babel
of
tongues
they
climbed
flight
after
flight
of
wooden
stairs
to
the
uppermost
floor
of
the
tall
an
empty
cage
that
had
just
deposited
its
load
of
copper
conglomerate
was
again
ready
to
descend
into
the
black
depths
and
hurrying
peveril
forward
mark
trefethen
with
half
a
dozen
other
miners
entered
it
an
iron
gate
closed
behind
them
and
a
gong
clanged
in
the
hold
fast
lad
and
remember
there
no
danger
was
all
that
the
timber
boss
had
time
to
say
then
the
bottom
seemed
to
drop
out
of
everything
and
peveril
experiencing
the
sickening
sensation
of
having
left
his
stomach
at
the
top
of
the
shaft
found
himself
rushing
downward
with
horrible
velocity
through
utter
blackness
instinctively
reaching
out
for
something
by
which
to
hold
on
he
clutched
a
arm
but
his
grasp
was
rudely
shaken
off
and
a
gruff
voice
bade
him
keep
his
hands
to
himself
he
could
not
frame
an
answer
for
his
brain
was
in
a
whirl
his
ears
were
filled
with
a
dull
roaring
and
a
whistling
rush
of
air
caught
away
his
breath
the
motion
of
the
cage
was
so
smooth
and
noiseless
that
after
a
while
he
could
not
tell
whether
it
were
going
up
or
down
though
it
seemed
to
be
doing
both
as
though
poised
on
a
gigantic
spring
at
length
faint
glimmers
of
light
began
to
flash
past
as
it
shot
by
the
mouths
of
working
levels
and
finally
it
stopped
with
a
jerk
that
threw
its
passengers
into
a
confused
huddle
a
gate
was
flung
open
and
as
peveril
stumbled
out
of
the
cage
he
was
only
conscious
of
dancing
lights
a
crashing
rumble
of
iron
against
iron
and
a
medley
of
shouting
voices
at
the
same
time
all
these
sounds
seemed
far
away
and
unreal
chapter
vi
a
mile
beneath
the
surface
swallow
lad
mark
trefethen
uttered
the
words
and
peveril
dimly
comprehending
him
instinctively
obeyed
the
effect
of
that
simple
muscular
action
was
marvellous
his
brain
was
instantly
cleared
of
its
weight
the
ringing
in
his
ears
ceased
and
his
hearing
was
restored
to
its
normal
keenness
at
the
same
time
he
was
happily
conscious
that
his
stomach
had
been
restored
to
its
proper
position
this
is
plat
of
bottom
level
and
we
a
mile
underground
continued
mark
they
put
us
down
in
this
time
but
often
they
do
it
ten
seconds
better
i
wonder
how
much
longer
it
would
take
to
drop
from
a
balloon
one
mile
above
the
earth
reflected
peveril
at
the
same
time
gazing
about
him
with
a
lively
interest
the
place
in
which
he
stood
was
a
spacious
room
hewn
from
solid
rock
lighted
by
several
lanterns
and
little
flaring
it
was
also
smoothly
floored
with
iron
plates
and
from
it
a
railway
led
away
into
the
blackness
articles
of
clothing
and
were
hung
about
the
walls
and
on
the
side
opposite
the
shaft
was
a
bench
of
rude
workmanship
every
few
minutes
an
iron
car
holding
several
tons
of
copper
rock
was
run
into
the
plat
with
a
tremendous
clatter
from
the
little
railway
that
penetrated
to
every
drift
and
stope
of
the
level
each
of
these
cars
was
pushed
by
a
team
of
three
men
who
were
stripped
naked
to
the
waist
their
haggard
faces
and
naked
bodies
were
begrimed
with
stained
red
with
and
gleamed
in
the
fitful
with
trickling
rivulets
of
perspiration
the
were
all
foreigners
italians
bohemians
hungarians
or
poles
and
the
uncouth
jargon
of
their
shouts
intensified
the
wildness
of
their
appearance
theirs
was
the
very
lowest
form
of
mine
drudgery
and
but
few
of
them
were
possessed
of
intelligence
or
ambition
sufficient
to
raise
them
above
it
one
who
was
accounted
somewhat
brighter
than
his
fellows
by
whom
he
was
regarded
as
a
leader
had
indeed
been
promoted
on
trial
by
the
timber
boss
to
a
position
in
his
own
gang
he
was
a
perfect
brute
for
strength
but
so
densely
ignorant
and
of
such
sullen
disposition
that
when
a
better
man
was
offered
in
the
person
of
dick
peveril
the
boss
was
only
too
glad
to
return
him
to
his
hated
task
of
and
accept
the
in
his
place
his
sentence
of
degradation
pronounced
only
the
day
before
had
been
received
as
a
personal
affront
by
every
of
the
mine
all
knew
that
some
one
must
fill
the
place
from
which
their
leader
had
been
ousted
and
all
were
prepared
to
hate
him
the
moment
his
identity
should
be
disclosed
thus
as
peveril
stumbled
awkwardly
out
of
the
cage
in
which
he
had
just
made
that
breathless
descent
he
was
instantly
spotted
as
being
a
new
man
and
a
team
of
slaking
their
thirst
at
a
in
one
corner
of
the
plat
gazed
at
him
with
scowling
intentness
that
they
might
minutely
describe
his
appearance
to
their
fellows
as
he
knew
nothing
of
the
circumstances
through
which
a
place
had
been
made
for
him
he
paid
no
attention
to
these
men
other
than
to
note
their
savage
appearance
as
a
feature
of
his
novel
surroundings
in
fact
he
had
barely
time
to
take
a
single
comprehensive
glance
around
the
plat
before
a
man
who
had
been
one
of
his
in
the
cage
remarked
sneeringly
pretty
well
scared
was
you
young
feller
yes
i
was
replied
peveril
turning
and
facing
his
questioner
but
how
did
you
know
it
by
the
way
you
grabbed
my
arm
if
you
done
it
again
i
have
punched
your
head
for
i
do
no
man
to
catch
holt
on
me
that
way
peveril
had
already
recognized
the
speaker
face
but
without
deigning
a
further
reply
he
turned
to
mark
trefethen
and
said
will
you
kindly
give
me
the
name
of
this
unpleasant
person
as
i
wish
to
file
it
away
in
my
memory
for
future
reference
person
be
blowed
exclaimed
the
man
stepping
forward
with
a
menacing
gesture
what
do
you
mean
by
calling
me
names
you
damned
shut
up
mike
connell
and
go
about
your
business
commanded
the
timber
boss
come
lad
he
not
worth
noticing
and
thus
saying
mark
trefethen
led
peveril
away
although
the
had
not
caught
the
words
of
this
brief
conversation
they
had
readily
understood
mike
connell
threatening
gesture
towards
the
and
several
times
during
that
day
one
or
more
of
them
might
have
been
seen
in
consultation
with
the
irishman
here
lad
fill
lamp
wi
sunlight
said
the
timber
boss
as
he
and
his
protégé
were
leaving
the
plat
first
rule
of
mine
is
always
have
lamp
in
trim
and
carry
candle
besides
plenty
of
matches
in
pocket
with
this
mark
scooped
up
in
his
hand
a
small
quantity
of
a
stiff
whitish
substance
from
an
open
box
beside
them
and
stuffed
it
into
his
lamp
the
box
was
indeed
marked
sunlight
but
when
peveril
followed
his
companion
example
he
found
its
contents
to
be
merely
solidified
paraffine
with
their
lamps
well
filled
and
flaring
brightly
the
two
walked
for
half
a
mile
through
a
dry
and
gallery
which
had
been
driven
by
drill
and
blast
through
solid
rock
and
from
which
thousands
of
tons
of
copper
had
been
taken
now
peveril
learned
for
the
first
time
what
timbering
a
mine
meant
and
realized
the
necessity
for
the
huge
piles
of
great
logs
that
he
had
seen
above
ground
in
close
proximity
to
the
shaft
not
only
had
it
been
incased
on
all
four
sides
by
logs
mortised
together
and
laid
up
like
the
walls
of
a
house
but
the
drift
through
which
he
now
walked
was
timbered
from
end
to
end
its
roof
was
upheld
by
huge
standing
from
ten
to
twenty
feet
apart
and
occasionally
in
groups
of
three
or
four
together
supported
by
them
and
pressing
against
the
roof
or
hanging
were
other
great
timbers
known
as
wall
plates
and
behind
these
was
a
compactly
laid
sheathing
of
split
timber
spoken
of
as
lagging
as
the
two
men
advanced
deeper
into
the
drift
an
occasional
pushed
by
its
panting
human
team
rumbled
heavily
past
while
every
now
and
then
came
dull
tremulous
shocks
like
those
of
an
earthquake
these
were
blasts
on
other
levels
or
in
other
parts
of
the
one
on
which
they
were
at
sound
of
a
confused
shouting
from
somewhere
ahead
of
them
they
stood
still
until
with
a
crashing
roar
that
bellowed
and
echoed
through
the
galleries
like
a
peal
of
loudest
thunder
one
of
these
blasts
was
fired
close
at
hand
a
minute
later
they
were
enveloped
in
a
pungent
smoke
through
which
twinkled
dimly
a
score
of
lights
brawny
forms
were
already
wielding
pick
and
shovel
amid
the
masses
of
rock
just
loosened
a
powerful
was
being
placed
in
position
for
another
attack
upon
the
wall
of
tough
rock
and
a
small
timber
gang
was
struggling
to
hoist
a
huge
log
that
they
called
a
stull
into
position
here
the
place
lad
take
hold
and
give
a
lift
now
boys
altogether
shouted
mark
trefethen
and
in
another
moment
dick
peveril
found
himself
hard
at
work
within
a
few
minutes
the
new
hand
was
as
begrimed
and
dripping
with
perspiration
as
any
member
of
the
gang
all
of
whom
exchanged
significant
glances
as
they
noted
the
willingness
with
which
he
exerted
his
great
strength
never
had
the
heavy
timbers
been
set
in
place
so
quickly
and
never
in
their
remembrance
had
a
green
hand
caught
on
so
readily
he
wo
last
long
though
at
that
pace
remarked
one
of
the
older
men
to
trefethen
as
he
paused
to
wipe
the
from
his
eyes
he
too
fresh
perhaps
not
replied
the
timber
boss
we
give
him
a
bit
of
a
try
though
before
dropping
him
and
then
he
walked
away
to
inspect
the
operations
of
another
gang
in
a
distant
part
of
the
mine
late
that
day
as
peveril
first
shift
of
work
drew
towards
its
close
he
ached
in
every
part
of
his
body
but
was
learning
his
new
trade
so
rapidly
that
his
fellows
were
already
beginning
to
regard
him
as
one
of
the
best
men
in
their
gang
he
had
made
several
trips
to
and
from
the
foot
of
the
in
company
with
others
and
so
when
shortly
before
quitting
time
the
foreman
of
his
gang
sang
out
oh
peril
just
run
back
to
the
stack
and
bring
us
one
of
them
small
sprags
hurry
now
the
new
man
started
without
a
hesitation
he
found
his
way
without
difficulty
to
the
timber
pile
and
began
a
search
for
such
a
piece
as
he
had
been
told
to
fetch
the
better
to
see
what
he
was
doing
he
removed
the
lamp
from
his
hat
and
held
it
low
in
front
of
him
in
which
position
his
own
face
was
clearly
revealed
by
its
light
while
he
was
thus
engaged
a
miner
who
with
his
day
work
finished
was
walking
towards
the
plat
paused
to
regard
him
the
man
face
bore
a
malicious
expression
and
he
seemed
to
meditate
some
mischief
towards
the
unsuspecting
youth
for
he
clinched
his
fists
and
took
a
step
in
peveril
direction
just
then
the
rumble
of
an
approaching
car
caused
him
to
pause
and
wait
until
it
should
pass
as
it
came
abreast
of
him
he
recognized
one
of
its
pushers
and
drew
him
aside
while
the
car
still
propelled
by
two
members
of
its
team
moved
on
out
of
sight
without
a
word
the
miner
directed
his
companion
attention
to
the
figure
still
bending
over
the
log
pile
and
made
several
significant
gestures
the
brutish
face
of
the
pusher
lighted
with
an
ugly
leer
expressive
of
understanding
and
he
began
to
move
cautiously
towards
the
man
who
had
that
day
displaced
him
from
the
timber
gang
as
he
had
left
his
light
on
the
car
there
was
nothing
to
warn
peveril
of
his
approach
until
he
was
close
at
hand
and
about
to
deliver
a
cowardly
blow
at
that
instant
the
mysterious
premonition
that
always
gives
warning
of
human
presence
caused
the
young
man
to
turn
his
head
although
he
was
too
late
to
avoid
the
impending
blow
it
was
deflected
by
his
movement
and
instead
of
stunning
him
it
merely
caused
him
to
stagger
and
drop
his
lamp
he
also
partially
warded
off
a
closely
following
second
blow
and
then
his
own
terrible
fist
was
planted
with
crashing
force
full
on
his
assailant
jaw
illustration
the
made
a
furious
attack
on
peveril
the
man
uttered
a
scream
of
agony
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
started
to
run
at
this
moment
the
other
two
appeared
on
the
scene
and
with
fierce
cries
began
a
furious
attack
upon
the
young
man
whom
they
had
sworn
either
to
kill
or
drive
from
the
mine
at
this
time
the
battleground
was
only
dimly
illumined
by
the
flickering
light
of
the
miner
who
was
thus
far
sole
spectator
of
the
contest
peveril
fought
in
dogged
silence
but
his
assailants
uttered
shrill
cries
in
an
unknown
tongue
attracted
by
these
other
lights
began
to
appear
from
both
directions
and
all
at
once
mark
gruff
tones
were
heard
demanding
to
know
what
was
going
on
at
this
sound
peveril
uttered
a
joyful
shout
while
at
the
same
moment
the
light
in
mike
connell
hat
was
extinguished
recognizing
his
protégé
voice
the
timber
boss
sprang
to
his
side
and
within
another
minute
the
two
would
have
been
annihilated
had
not
the
coming
of
a
second
car
given
them
a
reinforcement
of
three
more
savages
thus
beset
and
outnumbered
by
more
than
two
to
one
trefethen
thought
it
no
shame
to
call
for
aid
and
uplifting
his
mighty
voice
he
sent
rolling
and
echoing
through
the
galleries
the
rallying
cry
of
the
cornishmen
one
and
all
for
cornwall
one
and
all
chapter
vii
cornwall
to
the
rescue
one
and
all
the
of
the
most
clannish
county
in
england
the
one
in
which
from
land
end
to
plymouth
sound
every
family
claims
some
degree
of
cousinship
with
every
other
until
at
home
and
abroad
cousin
richard
is
the
name
proudly
borne
by
all
cornishmen
one
and
all
as
the
startling
cry
rang
through
the
black
underground
depths
it
was
heard
and
answered
caught
up
and
repeated
until
it
penetrated
the
remotest
corners
of
the
level
at
its
sound
the
men
of
cornwall
working
in
stope
or
drift
breast
or
dropped
their
tools
and
sprang
to
obey
its
summons
by
twos
and
threes
they
ran
shouting
the
magic
words
that
cornish
tongues
have
carried
around
the
world
they
met
in
eager
groups
each
demanding
to
know
who
had
first
given
the
alarm
and
its
cause
as
none
could
answer
and
the
shouts
still
came
from
far
away
they
swept
on
in
numbers
and
with
growing
anxiety
for
the
call
of
cornwall
is
never
given
save
in
an
emergency
in
the
meantime
the
fight
between
two
and
five
rages
with
unabated
fury
the
two
with
their
backs
to
a
wall
putting
up
the
splendid
defence
of
trained
boxers
against
the
fierce
but
untaught
rush
of
mere
brutes
science
however
labored
under
the
disadvantage
of
fighting
in
a
gloom
that
was
almost
darkness
for
mark
trefethen
lamp
had
been
extinguished
at
the
outset
and
the
only
one
still
burning
was
on
a
car
standing
at
a
distance
from
them
of
a
sudden
the
timber
boss
heard
a
groan
at
his
side
and
found
himself
fighting
alone
his
comrade
had
sunk
limply
to
the
ground
and
an
exultant
yell
from
the
others
proclaimed
their
knowledge
that
they
had
no
longer
to
fear
his
telling
blows
as
they
were
about
to
rush
in
and
complete
their
victory
the
of
cornwall
accompanied
by
the
flash
of
many
lights
came
rolling
down
the
gallery
help
was
close
at
hand
if
mark
trefethen
could
hold
out
for
another
minute
he
would
be
surrounded
by
friends
with
an
answering
shout
of
one
and
all
he
sprang
to
meet
his
assailants
and
realizing
their
danger
they
fled
before
him
at
the
same
instant
the
lamp
on
their
car
disappeared
and
in
the
utter
darkness
that
followed
trefethen
could
only
grope
his
way
back
to
peveril
side
a
moment
later
the
flaring
lights
of
the
cornish
miners
disclosed
the
old
man
with
face
battered
and
bleeding
standing
grimly
undaunted
beside
the
motionless
form
of
the
newest
comer
to
the
mine
the
latter
lay
unconscious
with
an
ugly
wound
on
the
side
of
his
head
from
which
blood
was
flowing
freely
it
had
been
made
by
a
fragment
of
copper
rock
evidently
taken
from
the
loaded
car
close
at
hand
and
flung
from
that
direction
several
other
similar
pieces
were
picked
up
near
where
the
two
men
had
defended
themselves
and
now
that
trefethen
had
time
for
reflection
he
recalled
having
heard
these
crash
against
the
wall
behind
him
who
had
flung
them
was
a
mystery
as
was
the
cause
of
the
attack
on
peveril
even
the
identity
of
his
assailants
seemed
likely
to
remain
unrevealed
for
these
had
slipped
away
in
the
darkness
and
though
the
rescuing
party
searched
the
level
like
a
swarm
of
angry
hornets
they
could
not
discover
a
man
bearing
on
his
person
any
signs
of
the
recent
fray
in
the
gloom
shrouding
the
scene
of
conflict
mark
trefethen
had
not
been
able
to
recognize
those
with
whom
he
fought
but
only
knew
them
to
be
foreigners
and
it
afterwards
transpired
that
a
number
of
these
had
on
that
evening
made
their
way
to
a
shaft
a
mile
distant
and
so
gained
the
surface
one
of
them
was
reported
to
have
had
his
head
tied
up
as
the
result
of
an
accident
but
no
one
had
recognized
him
while
certain
of
the
cornishmen
searched
the
mine
trefethen
and
others
bore
the
still
unconscious
form
of
richard
peveril
to
the
plat
and
sounded
the
alarm
signal
of
five
bells
nothing
so
startles
a
mining
community
as
to
have
this
signal
come
from
underground
it
may
mean
death
and
disaster
it
surely
means
that
there
are
injured
men
to
be
brought
up
to
the
surface
and
the
time
elapsing
before
their
arrival
is
always
filled
with
deepest
anxiety
it
was
so
in
the
present
case
and
when
the
cage
containing
the
two
battered
miners
one
of
whom
had
also
every
appearance
of
being
dead
emerged
from
the
shaft
a
throng
of
spectators
was
waiting
to
greet
it
these
learned
with
a
great
sigh
of
relief
that
there
had
been
no
accident
but
merely
a
fight
in
which
the
men
just
brought
up
were
supposed
to
be
the
only
ones
injured
their
revulsion
of
feeling
led
many
of
the
spectators
to
treat
the
whole
affair
as
a
joke
especially
as
the
only
person
seriously
hurt
was
a
stranger
it
always
as
stirs
up
shindies
growled
a
miner
who
having
reached
the
surface
a
few
minutes
earlier
formed
one
of
the
expectant
group
they
ought
not
to
be
let
underground
i
say
how
about
trefethen
asked
a
voice
he
no
oh
mark
a
quarrelsome
old
cuss
who
always
meddling
where
he
has
no
call
you
lie
mike
connell
and
you
know
it
my
father
never
fights
without
good
cause
cried
tom
trefethen
who
had
arrived
just
in
time
to
resent
the
slurring
remark
i
teach
you
you
young
whelp
shouted
the
miner
springing
furiously
forward
but
tom
leaped
aside
leaving
the
other
to
be
confronted
by
several
burly
cornishmen
in
whose
ears
was
still
ringing
the
cry
of
one
and
all
lad
right
maister
connell
said
one
of
these
if
believe
it
come
along
and
get
proof
but
the
irishman
muttering
something
about
not
caring
to
fight
all
cornwall
turned
abruptly
and
walked
away
tom
trefethen
not
yet
knowing
that
peveril
had
been
hurt
also
hurried
away
to
find
his
father
who
having
left
his
young
friend
in
the
hands
of
the
mine
surgeon
had
gone
to
change
his
clothing
at
the
same
time
poor
peveril
lay
in
a
small
room
of
the
having
the
gash
in
his
head
sewn
up
several
spectators
regarded
the
operation
curiously
and
among
them
was
a
gentleman
addressed
by
the
doctor
as
owen
whom
none
of
the
others
remembered
to
have
seen
before
but
who
seemed
to
take
a
great
interest
in
the
still
unconscious
sufferer
do
you
consider
it
a
serious
case
doctor
he
asked
no
not
at
all
serious
these
miners
are
a
tough
lot
and
not
easily
done
for
as
you
find
out
before
you
have
seen
as
much
of
them
as
i
have
this
one
will
probably
be
out
and
at
work
again
in
a
day
or
two
i
always
having
such
little
jobs
on
my
hands
the
results
of
accident
mostly
though
this
i
believe
is
a
case
of
fighting
something
very
uncommon
in
our
mine
i
can
assure
you
splendid
physique
has
he
face
though
hate
to
trust
myself
alone
with
him
i
understand
old
mark
trefethen
had
a
hard
tussle
before
he
brought
him
to
terms
what
was
the
trouble
i
do
know
exactly
insubordination
i
suppose
but
old
mark
do
put
up
with
any
nonsense
do
you
know
this
fellow
name
or
anything
about
him
um
yes
i
have
learned
something
but
not
much
his
name
is
peril
richard
peril
odd
name
is
it
he
a
and
like
yourself
has
just
entered
the
company
employ
rather
a
contrast
in
your
positions
though
illustrates
the
difference
between
one
brought
up
and
educated
as
a
gentleman
and
one
destined
from
the
first
for
the
other
thing
eh
it
is
all
poppycock
to
say
that
education
can
make
a
gentleman
do
you
think
so
in
the
present
case
for
instance
i
doubt
if
even
oxford
could
make
a
gentleman
of
this
fellow
his
whole
expression
is
a
protest
against
such
a
supposition
but
now
he
coming
to
all
right
and
i
glad
of
it
for
i
have
an
engagement
at
the
club
and
do
want
to
spend
much
more
time
with
him
poor
peveril
whose
begrimed
and
face
was
not
calculated
to
prepossess
one
in
his
favor
began
just
then
to
have
a
realizing
sense
that
he
was
still
alive
and
the
doctor
bending
over
him
said
there
now
my
man
you
are
doing
nicely
and
by
taking
care
of
yourself
you
will
be
about
again
in
a
day
or
two
you
had
a
close
call
though
and
it
a
warning
to
behave
yourself
in
the
future
for
i
can
assure
you
that
one
given
to
fighting
or
disobedience
of
orders
is
not
allowed
to
linger
in
these
parts
i
must
leave
you
now
but
will
call
again
this
evening
to
see
how
you
are
getting
along
what
is
your
address
he
lives
along
of
us
sir
answered
tom
trefethen
who
had
just
entered
the
room
and
if
you
think
it
safe
to
move
him
we
take
him
right
home
certainly
you
can
move
him
in
fact
he
could
walk
if
there
was
no
other
way
but
it
will
be
as
well
to
take
him
in
a
carriage
let
me
see
your
name
is
trefethen
is
it
not
yes
sir
very
well
put
your
boarder
to
bed
as
soon
as
you
get
him
home
keep
him
quiet
give
him
only
cooling
drinks
and
i
call
round
after
a
while
now
i
must
hurry
along
the
stranger
who
walked
away
with
the
young
doctor
was
none
other
than
peveril
oxford
classmate
dig
owen
who
having
obtained
a
position
in
the
eastern
office
of
the
white
pine
mining
company
had
been
advised
to
visit
the
mine
and
learn
something
of
its
practical
working
before
assuming
his
new
duties
he
had
just
arrived
when
the
rumor
of
an
accident
caused
him
to
hurry
to
the
there
he
was
thunderstruck
at
recognizing
in
one
of
the
two
men
brought
up
from
the
depths
his
recent
and
rival
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
he
had
very
nearly
betrayed
the
fact
of
their
acquaintance
but
managed
to
restrain
himself
and
was
afterwards
careful
to
keep
out
of
peveril
sight
foreseeing
a
great
advantage
to
himself
by
so
doing
that
same
evening
he
sat
in
the
comfortable
of
the
at
which
poor
peveril
had
gazed
with
envious
eyes
and
composed
a
long
epistle
to
rose
bonnifay
in
which
he
mentioned
that
he
had
just
run
across
their
mutual
friend
dick
peveril
working
as
a
in
a
this
he
continued
is
doubtless
the
mine
in
which
he
claimed
to
be
and
under
the
circumstances
one
can
hardly
blame
the
poor
fellow
for
putting
it
in
that
way
at
the
same
time
i
consider
it
only
fair
that
should
know
the
real
facts
in
the
case
his
misfortunes
seem
also
to
have
affected
his
disposition
for
on
the
very
day
of
my
arrival
he
was
engaged
in
a
most
disgraceful
fight
with
some
of
his
low
associates
by
whom
he
was
severely
and
justly
punished
of
course
i
could
not
afford
to
recognize
him
and
so
took
pains
to
have
him
kept
in
ignorance
of
my
presence
is
it
not
sad
that
a
fellow
of
such
promise
should
in
so
short
a
time
have
fallen
so
low
within
a
few
days
i
shall
return
to
the
east
where
my
own
prospects
are
of
the
brightest
etc
there
said
owen
to
himself
as
he
sealed
and
addressed
this
letter

that
do
effectually
squelch
richard
aspirations
in
a
certain
direction
then
i
no
judge
of
human
nature

evening
he

awaiting

as
she
informed

i
inquire
how

getting
along
you
may
indeed

and
may
the

preserve
you

sir
doubtless
madam
the
episode
must
have
been

exciting
but
now
if
you
will
allow
me
to
interview
the
cause
of
all
this
trouble
i
shall
be
much
obliged
trouble
doctor
dear
do
mention
the
word
when
hit
the
life
of
my
tom
in
two
and
but
for
they
cruel
rocks
that
battered
would
ha
throttled
them
rascal
pushers
same
as

in

for
my

there
was

but
doctor
doctor
oh
drat
the
man
now
go
hand
wake
maister
peril
which
i
were
a
to
tell
lad
asleep
impatient
of
longer
delay
and
despairing
of
obtaining
a
direct
answer
to
his
questions
the
doctor
had
indeed
slipped
into
the
house
and
instinctively
made
his
way
towards
the
only
room
in
which
a
light
was
burning
he
was
met
outside
the
door
by
a
warning
sh
from
nelly
trefethen
who
had
been
left
on
guard
by
her
mother
and
together
they
entered
the
room
where
the
wounded
man
lay
tossing
in
restless
slumber
the
doctor
started
at
close
sight
of
him
and
for
a
moment
refused
to
believe
that
the
handsome
face
from
which
every
trace
of
grime
and
blood
had
been
carefully
removed
was
that
of
the
young
fellow
who
he
had
declared
could
never
become
a
gentleman
only
the
evidence
of
his
own
handiwork
in
shape
of
the
bandages
still
swathing
peveril
head
served
to
convince
him
that
this
was
indeed
his
patient
of
the
after
a
few
minutes
of
observation
he
left
the
room
without
awakening
the
sleeper
and
gave
his
directions
for
the
night
he
also
questioned
nelly
closely
concerning
the
young
man
who
had
so
aroused
his
curiosity
but
she
could
only
tell
him
that
the
name
was
peril
that
he
had
come
to
red
jacket
in
search
of
work
had
saved
her
brother
tom
life
and
had
in
consequence
been
given
a
job
in
the
mine
but
he
is
evidently
a
gentleman
said
the
doctor
claims
to
be
put
in
trefethen
he
can
be
both
ca
he
mother
asked
nelly
somewhat
sharply
surely
you
think
father
is
a
gentleman
not
same
as
him
yonder
replied
the
older
woman
stoutly
well
i
do
care
what
he
is
or
is
answered
the
girl
with
a
toss
of
her
pretty
head
he
has
shown
any
sign
yet
of
holding
himself
above
us
and
tom
thinks
he
is
just
splendid
if
he
was
here
he
would
hear
a
word
said
against
him
i
know
that
much
save
us
lass
who
said
aught
thy
young
man
he
not
my
young
man
mother
and
you
know
it
ca
a
girl
stand
up
for
a
stranger
who
saved
her
brother
life
and
who
has
just
been
knocked
senseless
while
fighting
beside
her
own
father
without
being
twitted
about
him
certainly
she
can
replied
the
doctor
with
an
admiring
glance
at
the
girl
spirited
pose
and
flushed
face
but
have
a
care
miss
nelly
there
nothing
so
dangerous
to
a
girl
peace
of
mind
as
an
interesting
invalid
of
the
opposite
sex
thank
you
for
nothing
doctor
and
you
need
fret
one
little
bit
about
me
we
red
jacket
girls
can
take
care
of
ourselves
without
going
to
any
man
for
advice
save
us
lass
but
thee
getting
a
pert
hussy
cried
trefethen
but
the
doctor
only
laughed
and
took
his
departure
promising
to
call
again
the
next
day
he
had
hardly
gone
before
mark
trefethen
returned
filled
with
excitement
over
certain
discoveries
he
had
just
made
one
was
that
the
of
the
mine
had
sworn
either
to
force
peveril
from
it
or
to
kill
him
he
had
also
learned
that
rothsky
the
bohemian
who
had
been
found
wanting
when
tried
in
the
timber
gang
had
led
the
attack
of
that
evening
and
had
received
a
broken
jaw
in
consequence
the
identity
of
the
two
who
were
with
him
at
the
time
having
also
been
discovered
the
captain
of
the
mine
had
promptly
discharged
all
three
moreover
the
cornish
miners
had
sworn
that
if
either
their
own
leader
or
his
protégé
were
again
molested
while
underground
they
would
drive
every
foreign
from
the
workings
when
tom
came
home
he
confided
to
his
father
a
belief
that
mike
connell
had
been
at
the
bottom
of
all
the
recent
deviltry
but
as
he
confessed
that
he
could
not
verify
his
suspicions
mark
trefethen
bade
him
keep
them
to
himself
we
not
take
away
any
man
character
lad
he
said
without
proof
that
he
deserves
to
lose
it
but
if
ever
i
know
for
certain
that
mike
connell
had
hand
in
this
lat
him
have
a
care
o
me
as
for
yon
dick
peril
there
no
fear
but
what
he
can
look
out
for
hissel
now
that
we
can
warn
him
of
his
enemies
for
two
days
peveril
kept
his
bed
assiduously
waited
on
by
trefethen
and
her
daughter
watched
over
at
night
by
tom
and
an
object
of
anxious
solicitude
to
the
entire
family
then
he
was
allowed
to
venture
while
the
children
were
driven
from
the
house
that
they
might
not
disturb
him
before
the
week
ended
he
was
taking
short
walks
escorted
by
miss
nelly
who
was
only
too
proud
to
show
off
this
new
cavalier
before
the
other
girls
of
her
acquaintance
several
times
as
the
doctor
saw
them
thus
together
he
shook
his
head
doubtfully
during
one
of
these
walks
peveril
made
the
joyful
discovery
of
a
public
library
and
thereafter
much
of
his
convalescence
was
passed
within
its
walls
there
he
read
with
avidity
all
that
he
could
find
concerning
the
lake
superior
copper
region
and
mining
in
general
particularly
was
he
interested
in
everything
pertaining
to
the
prehistoric
mining
of
copper
by
a
people
presumably
aztecs
or
their
close
kin
who
possessed
the
art
long
since
lost
of
tempering
that
metal
all
this
time
he
never
for
a
moment
forgot
the
object
of
his
coming
to
that
country
nor
neglected
a
possible
opportunity
for
gaining
news
of
the
mine
in
which
he
believed
himself
to
be
a
thus
in
all
his
reading
as
well
as
in
his
conversations
with
mark
trefethen
and
other
miners
he
always
sought
for
information
concerning
the
copper
princess
but
could
find
none
his
books
had
nothing
to
say
on
the
subject
and
while
the
men
knew
by
report
of
many
abandoned
mining
properties
they
had
not
heard
of
one
bearing
the
name
in
question
finally
chafing
under
this
enforced
idleness
as
well
as
under
the
poverty
that
compelled
him
to
be
a
pensioner
on
those
who
could
ill
afford
to
support
him
peveril
announced
his
complete
restoration
to
health
and
declared
his
intention
of
again
going
to
work
mark
trefethen
tried
to
persuade
him
to
wait
a
while
longer
before
thus
testing
his
strength
but
without
avail
and
at
length
finding
the
young
man
set
in
his
determination
used
his
influence
to
procure
for
him
a
temporary
situation
in
which
the
work
would
be
much
lighter
than
with
the
timber
gang
this
job
was
in
a
shaft
then
being
sunk
by
the
white
pine
company
and
included
a
certain
supervision
of
the
explosives
used
in
blasting
the
new
shaft
was
already
down
several
hundred
feet
and
was
being
driven
through
solid
rock
by
drill
and
blast
at
the
rate
of
twenty
feet
per
week
of
course
there
was
no
regular
running
of
cages
up
and
down
as
yet
but
the
loosened
material
was
hoisted
to
the
surface
in
a
big
iron
bucket
or
skip
and
in
this
the
miners
engaged
in
the
work
also
travelled
back
and
forth
the
great
opening
was
a
rectangle
by
six
and
a
half
feet
and
to
sink
it
a
series
of
holes
was
drilled
around
its
sides
then
all
the
men
but
one
were
sent
to
the
surface
while
peveril
descended
with
a
load
of
dynamite
and
a
fuse
the
man
left
at
the
bottom
was
always
an
experienced
miner
and
it
was
his
duty
to
charge
the
holes
place
and
light
the
fuses
which
were
timed
to
burn
for
several
minutes
jump
into
the
skip
and
give
the
signal
for
hoisting
in
all
of
this
work
he
was
of
course
assisted
by
peveril
and
when
their
task
was
completed
the
two
men
were
lifted
to
the
surface
as
quickly
as
possible
after
our
young
friend
had
been
engaged
in
this
delicate
business
some
two
weeks
and
had
become
thoroughly
familiar
with
its
details
he
was
disagreeably
surprised
one
day
upon
descending
with
his
freight
of
explosives
to
find
mike
connell
awaiting
him
at
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
the
irishman
seemed
equally
annoyed
at
seeing
him
but
the
purpose
for
which
they
were
there
must
be
accomplished
and
so
glad
as
each
would
have
been
for
a
more
congenial
companion
they
set
doggedly
to
work
when
connell
in
a
spirit
of
bravado
handled
the
sticks
of
dynamite
with
criminal
recklessness
and
finally
managed
to
drop
one
of
them
close
beside
peveril
the
latter
sharply
commanded
him
to
be
more
careful
afraid
are
you
sneered
the
other
yes
i
am
afraid
to
work
with
a
man
who
knows
so
little
of
his
business
as
you
appear
to
answered
peveril
go
to
the
top
then
and
lave
me
to
finish
the
job
alone
lord
knows
i
do
want
no
dealings
with
a
coward
it
makes
no
difference
what
you
want
or
do
not
want
answered
the
younger
man
steadily
though
with
a
hot
flush
mounting
to
his
cheeks
i
was
sent
here
for
a
certain
duty
and

to
stay
until
i

performed

do

i
ought
to
have
done
the
first
day
you
struck
red

and
that
is
to
punch
your
head
you
shall
have
a
chance
to
try
it
when
we
get
to
the
surface
where
you
think
you
find
friends
to
protect
you
no
by
do
it
now
with
this
the
irishman
sprang
forward
with
clinched
fists
but
the
other
being
on
guard
caught
him
so
deft
a
blow
under
the
chin
that
he
dropped
like
a
log
then
with
the
full
exercise
of
his
strength
the
young
oxonian
picked
his
enemy
up
and
dropped
him
into
the
skip
after
doing
which
he
proceeded
to
complete
arrangements
for
the
blast
he
worked
with
nervous
haste
and
did
not
see
that
his
enemy
had
so
far
recovered
as
to
be
watching
him
with
an
expression
of
deadly
hate
over
the
side
of
the
great
iron
bucket
but
it
was
so
and
just
as
peveril
had
lighted
the
several
fuses
connell
gave
the
signal
to
hoist
the
movement
of
the
skip
disclosed
his
devilish
purpose
in
time
for
peveril
to
spring
and
catch
with
outstretched
arms
one
of
its
supporting
bars
with
a
mighty
effort
he
drew
himself
up
and
in
spite
of
connell
furious
attempts
to
prevent
him
gained
its
interior
at
that
moment
something
went
wrong
with
the
hoisting
machinery
the
upward
movement
was
arrested
and
the
bucket
hung
motionless
not
more
than
ten
feet
above
the
deadly
mine
in
the
awfulness
of
their
common
danger
the
men
forgot
their
enmity
and
gazed
at
each
other
with
eyes
then
with
a
groan
of
despair
mike
connell
sank
limply
to
the
bottom
of
the
skip

peveril
lamp
had
been
extinguished
during
his
struggle
to
force
an
entrance
into
the
skip
while
that
in
mike
connell
hat
went
out
as
he
sank
helpless
from
terror
and
crouched
at
the
other
feet
so
the
blackness
that
shrouded
them
as
with
a
pall
was
only
faintly
illumined
by
the
fitful
flashing
of
the
fuses
that
hissed
like
so
many
fiery
serpents
beneath
them
their
red
eyes
gleamed
spitefully
through
the
gloom
and
for
an
instant
peveril
leaning
over
the
side
of
the
skip
gazed
at
them
in
fascinated
helplessness
then
he
leaped
down
among
them
and
began
to
tear
them
from
their
connection
with
the
devilish
forces
that
only
awaited
a
signal
to
burst
forth
and
destroy
him
the
fiery
serpents
bit
at
him
as
he
flung
them
to
writhe
in
impotent
rage
where
they
could
do
no
harm
but
he
heeded
not
the
pain
and
after
a
little
they
expired
one
by
one
hissing
spitefully
to
the
last
some
of
them
had
already
burned
so
low
that
he
could
not
pluck
them
forth
and
was
forced
to
stamp
out
their
venomous
lives
with
the
constant
knowledge
that
should
a
single
spark
escape
this
imperfect
method
of
extinguishment
he
would
still
be
lost
so
fiercely
did
he
labor
that
in
less
than
one
minute
the
last
visible
spark
from
a
score
of
fuses
had
glimmered
out
and
he
stood
in
absolute
darkness
but
he
must
wait
for
a
full
minute
more
before
he
could
be
certain
that
none
had
escaped
him
to
creep
viciously
down
through
the
loose
tamping
and
still
reach
the
hidden
dynamite
it
was
a
period
of
the
same
helpless
anxiety
that
immediately
precedes
the
hearing
of
a
sentence
that
may
be
either
one
of
death
or
acquittal
while
it
lasted
peveril
was
bathed
in
a
cold
perspiration
his
brain
reeled
and
his
limbs
trembled
until
he
was
obliged
to
lean
against
the
side
of
the
shaft
for
support
as
second
after
second
dragged
itself
away
until
it
was
finally
certain
that
sixty
of
them
had
passed
and
that
sentence
had
been
pronounced
in
his
favor
the
young
miner
sank
to
his
knees
and
framed
as
best
he
could
a
prayer
of
gratitude
how
long
he
thus
remained
in
grateful
contemplation
of
his
narrow
escape
from
death
he
never
knew
but
he
was
at
length
aroused
by
a
shout
from
above
and
looking
up
saw
an
approaching
light
twinkling
like
a
star
of
good
promise
through
the
blackness
the
call
that
came
to
him
was
one
of
anxious
uncertainty
but
as
his
answering
shout
sped
upward
it
was
changed
to
an
exultant
cry
of
joy
then
came
cheer
after
cheer
as
the
skip
slowly
descended
until
it
finally
reached
the
bottom
and
a
solitary
figure
sprang
from
it
illustration
peveril
leaped
down
among
the
sputtering
fuses
this
person
acted
like
a
crazy
man
first
flinging
his
arms
about
peveril
and
then
falling
on
his
knees
at
the
young
man
feet
with
a
torrent
of
words
in
which
praise
and
gratitude
were
mingled
with
pleas
for
forgiveness
he
was
peveril
recent
companion
and
avowed
enemy
who
after
the
former
had
leaped
from
the
skip
had
leaned
weakly
over
its
side
and
watched
with
fascinated
gaze
the
struggle
for
life
going
on
below
him
ere
it
was
ended
the
began
again
to
work
and
the
skip
was
suddenly
impelled
upward
with
breathless
speed
those
who
witnessed
its
safe
arrival
at
the
surface
had
their
congratulations
changed
to
exclamations
of
dismay
by
the
discovery
that
it
contained
but
a
single
occupant
though
the
for
the
explosion
was
already
passed
and
though
mike
connell
begged
them
to
send
him
down
again
at
once
they
refused
to
do
so
until
another
full
minute
should
elapse
during
its
slow
passage
they
crowded
about
the
in
breathless
silence
listening
with
strained
ears
for
the
awful
sound
they
so
dreaded
to
hear
even
with
the
minute
of
safety
passed
it
was
not
certain
that
the
explosion
might
not
yet
occur
but
the
young
irishman
demanded
so
fiercely
to
be
instantly
lowered
to
the
very
bottom
that
they
finally
consented
to
do
as
he
desired
several
were
even
willing
to
accompany
him
but
he
waved
these
back
and
insisted
upon
going
alone
he
had
to
meet
the
man
to
whom
he
owed
his
life
as
well
as
a
shameful
confession
of
cowardly
acts
and
he
preferred
to
meet
him
alone
two
minutes
later
he
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
kneeling
in
on
its
rocky
floor
acknowledging
his
obligation
confessing
his
guilt
and
imploring
forgiveness
you
are
the
bravest
man
i
ever
known
mister
peril
though
met
them
as
was
counted
brave
before
but
none
of
them
would
dare
do
what
you
have
this
day
you
have
given
me
my
life
and
yet
i
tried
twice
to
take
yours
for
was
me
flung
that
rock
in
the
mine
and
i
choked
with
the
shame
of
the
black
deed
but
i
gave
the
signal
to
hoist
the
skip
a
few
minutes
since
and
tried
to
leave
you
here
to
die
i
a
coward
and
a
murderer
at
heart
mister
peril
and
the
dirtiest
blackguard
that
ever
was
let
live
i
not
worthy
of
your
contempt
and
yet
sir
i
going
to
dare
ask
a
favor
of
you
my
dear
fellow
interrupted
peveril
who
was
greatly
moved
by
the
man
attitude
and
words
of
believe
me
wait
mister
peril
please
wait
sir
till
you
heard
me
through
you
have
the
right
to
hate
me
to
despise
me
or
even
to
kill
me
and
i
not
lift
a
finger
to
prevent
you
but
i
going
to
ask
you
to
forgive
me
if
you
do
i
can
never
hold
up
my
head
or
look
an
honest
man
in
the
face
again
if
you
ca
forgive
me
i
shall
never
dare
ask
the
forgiveness
of
god
in
heaven
i
do
forgive
you
with
all
my
heart
exclaimed
peveril
and
there
is
my
hand
on
it
with
this
he
grasped
the
young
irishman
hand
and
almost
lifted
him
to
his
feet
you
have
done
a
brave
deed
in
coming
down
here
after
me
he
added
while
there
was
still
danger
of
an
explosion
and
one
much
braver
even
than
that
in
confessing
your
faults
these
two
things
prove
that
you
are
not
a
coward
and
from
this
time
on
i
shall
claim
you
as
a
friend
thank
you
mister
peril
and
may
god
bless
you
for
them
words
cried
connell
in
a
voice
choked
with
feeling
as
for
being
your
friend
sir
i
be
proud
to
be
counted
your
slave
i
would
much
rather
have
a
friend
than
a
slave
returned
the
other
smiling
and
so
if
you
do
mind
we
stick
to
the
first
proposition
but
connell
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
what
made
you
hate
me
as
you
seemed
to
do
from
the
very
first
jealousy
mister
peril
just
black
bitter
jealousy
and
nothing
at
all
else
how
could
that
be
when
you
did
even
know
me
because
sir
i
near
crazy
with
love
for
a
girl
who
only
laughs
at
me
and
whose
folks
treat
me
with
contempt
when
i
first
saw
you
so
strong
and
handsome
and
with
her
father
and
knew
he
was
going
to
take
you
to
live
in
the
very
house
along
of
her
i
could
help
but
hate
you
you
surely
ca
mean
miss
trefethen
yes
sir
no
other
and
when
i
seen
you
and
her
walking
together
and
she
looking
up
so
smiling
into
your
face
i
swore
i
kill
you
if
ever
i
had
the
chance
and
this
day
the
devil
gave
it
to
me
but
now
mister
peril
you
proved
yourself
the
best
man
of
us
two
and
if
you
want
her
i
never
again
stand
in
your
way
but
i
do
want
her
cried
peveril
nothing
was
ever
farther
from
my
thoughts
and
even
if
i
did
i
could
have
her
because
i
am
engaged
to
another
young
lady
you
are
sir
bless
you
for
them
words
and
may
i
tell
her
that
you
are
already
bespoke
certainly
or
better
still
i
will
tell
her
myself
at
the
very
first
opportunity
i
have
for
speaking
with
her
on
such
a
subject
but
now
that
everything
is
settled
between
us
do
you
think
we
better
prepare
the
blast
again
before
we
go
up
there
is
fuse
enough
left
in
the
skip
well
you
are
a
game
one
exclaimed
connell
admiringly
of
course
if
you
are
willing
to
do
it
after
what
you
just
gone
through
the
man
to
stand
by
you
only
i
do
hope
as
there
wo
be
no
hitch
in
the
hoisting
this
time
the
signal
all
well
having
already
been
sent
to
the
surface
connell
now
notified
the
engineer
to
be
ready
to
hoist
for
a
blast
and
the
two
set
to
work
in
a
few
minutes
the
charge
that
had
so
nearly
proved
fatal
to
both
of
them
was
again
ready
for
firing
and
the
hissing
fuses
were
lighted
then
both
men
sprang
into
the
skip
the
signal
to
hoist
was
hurriedly
sounded
and
away
they
sped
up
the
black
shaft
towards
the
distant
sunlight
as
they
reached
the
surface
and
clambered
from
the
skip
aided
by
a
dozen
eager
hands
there
came
from
the
depths
below
a
dull
roar
and
the
tremor
of
a
heavy
explosion
at
this
a
throng
of
persons
which
to
peveril
surprise
was
gathered
at
the
raised
a
mighty
cheer
then
they
crowded
tumultuously
forward
to
shake
hands
with
or
even
to
gaze
on
the
hero
of
the
hour
for
on
his
previous
visit
to
surface
mike
connell
had
told
of
peveril
brave
deed
and
news
of
it
had
already
spread
far
and
wide
so
the
had
paused
to
see
him
before
entering
the
mine
and
the
had
waited
to
greet
him
before
going
to
their
homes
while
others
had
come
from
all
directions
waving
them
all
back
and
grasping
peveril
hand
mike
connell
shouted
wait
a
minute
mates
only
one
minute
and
then
you
shall
have
a
chance
at
him
first
though
i
want
you
all
to
know
that
mister
peril
here
has
just
stepped
from
the
very
jaws
of
hell
where
he
went
of
his
own
free
will
to
save
my
life
it
proud
i
am
to
call
him
my
friend
and
for
the
deed
he
has
done
this
day
i
name
him
the
bravest
lad
in
all
red
jacket
if
any
man
denies
that
he
have
to
settle
with
mike
connell
that
all
and
now
boys
you
may
treat
him
as
a
brave
man
deserves
to
be
treated
poor
peveril
covered
with
confusion
tried
to
explain
that
whatever
he
had
done
was
for
his
own
salvation
as
well
as
for
that
of
his
friend
connell
but
no
one
would
listen
all
were
too
busy
with
cheering
and
in
crowding
forward
for
a
look
at
him
in
another
minute
he
was
hoisted
on
the
shoulders
of
half
a
dozen
sturdy
miners
the
foremost
of
whom
was
proud
old
mark
trefethen
and
was
being
borne
in
triumphal
procession
through
the
principal
streets
of
the
town
it
was
a
spontaneous
tribute
of
to
a
and
gladly
as
peveril
would
have
modified
the
form
of
the
ovation
he
was
more
proud
of
it
than
of
any
ever
tendered
him
for
having
stroked
the
oxford
eight
to
a
win
chapter
x
heroism
rewarded
as
the
story
of
peveril
brave
act
preceded
him
it
gained
so
remarkably
in
passing
from
mouth
to
mouth
that
by
the
time
it
reached
trefethen
she
received
a
confused
impression
that
by
some
bravery
the
young
man
had
saved
all
in
the
mine
including
her
mark
and
her
tom
from
instant
destruction
her
information
having
come
direct
from
her
dearest
friend
penny
she
could
not
doubt
its
truth
nor
had
she
time
to
do
so
before
the
triumphal
procession
of
miners
appeared
and
halted
at
her
very
door
calling
upon
nelly
to
support
her
the
worthy
woman
started
forth
to
greet
her
heroes
and
welcome
them
with
all
the
warmth
of
her
overflowing
heart
as
she
gained
the
roadway
she
was
so
blinded
by
thankful
tears
that
she
could
not
distinguish
one
person
from
another
but
impulsively
flung
her
arms
about
the
neck
of
the
first
man
she
encountered
who
happened
to
be
mike
connell
and
treated
him
to
a
hearty
embrace
gie
mun
a
kiss
lass
she
called
to
nelly
as
she
loosed
her
arms
and
made
towards
another
victim
nought
too
good
for
they
brave
lads
this
day
oh
mark
man
but
i
be
proud
o
being
thy
earthly
wife
o
seeing
thee
in
this
blessed
minute
this
last
was
addressed
to
a
bewildered
stranger
whom
trefethen
had
mistaken
for
her
husband
and
who
was
vainly
striving
to
escape
from
her
encircling
arms
art
crazy
mother
to
be
hustling
men
in
public
street
thiccy
way
i
be
of
cried
mark
trefethen
catching
hold
of
his
wife
at
this
moment
come
along
in
house
or
if
must
have
man
to
hug
take
me
or
tom
here
or
maister
peril
who
deserves
it
best
of
all
for
this
day
work
nothing
loath
to
do
as
she
was
bid
trefethen
made
a
third
effort
to
express
her
feelings
towards
peveril
in
her
own
peculiar
fashion
but
he
laughingly
evaded
her
and
she
fell
instead
upon
the
neck
of
another
astonished
stranger
who
happened
in
her
way
and
upon
whose
head
she
tearfully
called
down
the
choicest
blessings
of
heaven
thee
saved
me
from
widow
grave
lad
which
the
same
i
frequent
saz
to
miss

nelly
gie
maister
peril
a
kiss

in
token
of
thy
forgiveness
for
what

this
day
so
saying
the
blunderer
released
her
victim
with
the
view
of
allowing
nelly
a
chance
to
express
her
gratitude
and
for
the
first
time
caught
sight
of
his
face
thee
not
dick
peril
she
cried
thee
mean
by
scandalizing
honest
woman
thiccy
way
is
thee
on
thysel
thou
great
lump
the
poor
man
tried
in
vain
to
explain
his
innocence
of
act
or
intention
but
his
voice
was
drowned
in
the
boisterous
laughter
of
his
mates
amid
which
the
crowd
gradually
dispersed
while
trefethen
still
exclaiming
against
the
duplicity
of
men
in
general
was
led
into
the
house
by
her
husband
and
son
in
the
meantime
miss
nelly
had
demurely
shaken
hands
with
mike
connell
who
was
still
gasping
in
astonishment
at
the
warmth
of
trefethen
reception
then
she
kissed
her
father
and
tom
stole
one
look
at
peveril
face
and
murmuring
something
about
seeing
after
supper
ran
into
the
house
although
peveril
had
not
forgotten
the
promise
to
his
newly
made
friend
to
inform
nelly
of
his
own
engagement
as
soon
as
possible
he
had
no
chance
to
do
so
that
evening
for
supper
had
hardly
been
eaten
when
he
began
to
receive
visitors
eager
to
congratulate
him
upon
his
recent
act
of
heroism
among
these
was
major
arkell
general
manager
of
the
mine
whom
the
young
man
had
never
before
met
the
trefethens
were
thrown
into
a
flutter
of
hospitable
pride
by
the
coming
to
their
cottage
of
so
distinguished
a
visitor
but
after
a
courteous
greeting
to
them
he
devoted
his
entire
attention
to
him
whom
he
had
come
purposely
to
see
after
the
latter
had
been
introduced
to
him
as
peril
he
asked
so
many
questions
concerning
the
recent
incident
as
to
finally
draw
out
the
whole
story
of
that
day
experience
he
was
a
good
listener
though
a
man
of
few
words
and
during
peveril
narrative
gained
a
very
fair
idea
of
our
young
miner
education
and
capabilities
when
the
latter
had
finished
the
major
asked
him
if
he
proposed
to
continue
his
career
as
a
miner
i
expect
i
shall
have
to
answered
peveril
seeing
that
i
am
entirely
dependent
upon
my
own
exertions
for
a
livelihood
and
have
no
knowledge
of
any
other
business
do
you
mind
telling
me
what
led
you
to
choose
this
line
of
work
from
all
others
because
replied
peveril
flushing
finding
myself
in
red
jacket
without
a
dollar
i
was
glad
to
accept
the
first
job
that
offered
and
we
was
only
too
glad
to
have
him
for
one
of
us
major
broke
in
mark
trefethen
seeing
as
how
he
introduced
himself
by
saving
our
tom
life
indeed
i
had
heard
of
that
how
did
it
happen
glad
of
an
opportunity
for
singing
his
young
friend
praises
the
timber
boss
eagerly
related
the
incident
and
when
it
was
told
the
manager
said
with
a
smile
well
sir
you
seem
to
have
such
a
happy
faculty
for
that
i
do
know
but
what
we
ought
to
appoint
you
inspector
of
accidents
seriously
though
i
am
very
glad
to
have
a
man
of
your
evident
ability
and
steady
nerve
with
us
and
if
you
are
inclined
to
remain
in
our
employ
i
shall
make
it
my
business
to
see
that
your
interests
do
not
suffer
so
if
you
will
call
at
my
office
about
eight
morning
i
shall
be
pleased
to
have
a
further
talk
with
you
thank
you
sir
rejoined
peveril
i
will
not
fail
to
be
there
after
the
great
man
had
departed
the
trefethens
indulged
in
many
speculations
as
to
what
he
intended
to
do
for
their
guest
nor
was
peveril
himself
devoid
of
a
hopeful
curiosity
in
the
same
direction
mayhap
he
make
suggested
trefethen
hand
if
only
will
maister
peril
me
and

or

like
that
tom
thought
it
might
be
a
job
connected
with
the
railroad
which
was
his
own
ambition
while
nelly
usually
so
ready
with
her
tongue
for
a
wonder
kept
silent
and
made
no
suggestions
on
the
following
morning
when
promptly
at
eight
peveril
presented
himself
at
the
manager
office
his
patience
was
tried
by
being
compelled
to
wait
in
an
anteroom
for
more
than
an
hour
while
the
great
man
despatched
an
immense
amount
of
business
with
many
subordinates
richard
could
not
help
overhearing
many
of
the
conversations
carried
on
in
the
private
office
and
as
he
listened
was
filled
with
admiration
at
the
decisive
readiness
with
which
the
manager
disposed
of
one
difficult
problem
after
another
finally
when
all
the
others
had
been
dismissed
peveril
was
summoned
to
the
inner
room
where
after
a
word
of
regret
at
having
kept
him
so
long
in
waiting
the
manager
bade
him
be
seated
and
said
peril
it
is
so
evident
that
you
have
been
accustomed
to
a
position
far
removed
from
that
of
a
common
laborer
that
i
am
desirous
of
knowing
something
more
of
your
life
before
intrusting
you
with
a
responsibility
do
you
mind
telling
me
what
brought
you
to
this
section
of
country
no
sir
i
do
know
that
i
do
i
came
out
here
ruined
in
fortune
through
no
fault
of
my
own
to
seek
information
concerning
an
old
and
i
believe
a
mine
known
as
the
copper
princess
um
i
remember
hearing
the
name
and
if
i
am
not
mistaken
it
applied
to
a
worthless
property
on
which
a
large
sum
of
money
was
squandered
many
years
since
yes
sir
how
are
you
interested
in
it
my
father
was
an
owner
and
i
am
his
heir
i
am
glad
you
have
told
me
this
and
relieved
to
find
that
no
worse
folly
has
caused
a
gentleman
to
seek
employment
as
a
common
miner
though
i
can
not
hold
out
the
slightest
hope
that
you
will
ever
recover
a
dollar
from
your
property
still
i
will
make
inquiries
and
let
you
know
anything
i
may
learn
thank
you
sir
do
you
know
anything
about
boats
asked
the
manager
abruptly
changing
the
subject
yes
sir
i
have
handled
boats
more
or
less
all
my
life
good
then
i
want
you
to
take
charge
of
a
gang
of
men
whom
you
will
find
awaiting
you
on
the
company
tug
down
at
the
landing
they
are
going
some
distance
up
the
coast
to
recover
whatever
may
be
found
of
a
valuable
timber
raft
belonging
to
us
and
wrecked
near
laughing
fish
cove
during
the
gale
of
two
days
ago
all
our
logs
are
marked
if
you
find
any
such
in
possession
of
other
parties
you
will
lay
claim
to
them
and
even
take
them
by
force
if
necessary
the
tug
will
leave
you
at
the
cove
where
you
will
establish
a
camp
and
to
which
you
will
raft
the
recovered
logs
holding
them
against
her
return
which
will
be
in
about
a
week
here
is
a
note
of
introduction
to
her
captain
do
you
understand
yes
sir
i
think
i
do
then
you
may
start
at
once
very
well
sir
and
the
young
man
realizing
his
employer
love
of
promptness
rose
to
leave
by
the
way
said
the
other
as
he
reached
the
door
is
your
name
peril
no
sir
it
is
peveril
richard
yes
sir
then
this
letter
is
probably
for
you
it
has
lain
here
several
days
awaiting
a
claimant
with
this
major
arkell
handed
the
young
man
a
missive
that
he
acknowledged
to
be
for
him
and
which
as
he
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
he
saw
with
a
thrill
of
joy
was
addressed
in
the
handwriting
of

chapter
xi
nelly
trefethen
finds
a
letter
having
donned
his
best
suit
for
the
interview
with
major
arkell
and
realizing
that
his
mine
clothing
would
be
more
in
keeping
with
the
job
now
on
hand
peveril
first
hastened
home
to
make
the
change
he
found
only
trefethen
in
the
house
and
at
sight
of
him
she
expressed
an
eager
curiosity
to
learn
the
result
of
his
recent
interview
it
all
right
he
laughed
as
he
bounded
up
the
narrow
stairway
leading
to
his
room
i
to
turn
sailor
and
be
captain
of
a
craft
somewhere
up
the
coast
whativer
can
lad
mean
exclaimed
the
perplexed
woman
a
sailor
did
iver
any
one
the
like
o
that
oh
maister
peril
be
iver
coming
back
of
course
i
am
shouted
peveril
from
the
little
upper
room
in
which
he
was
hastily
changing
his
clothing
i
shall
be
back
whenever
my
ship
comes
in
which
will
probably
be
in
a
week
or
it
may
take
a
few
days
longer
there
a
wreck
you
know
and
i
am
going
to
save
the
pieces
but
i
be
down
directly
a
wrack
gasped
trefethen
and
in
hit
save
us
but
be
worse
than
down
shaft
shaft
be
dry
land
anyway
but
they
awful
sea
that
rageth
like
a
lion
seeking
whom
it
may
devour
oh
maister
peril
yes
coming
the
young
man
was
just
then
making
a
hasty
transfer
of
the
contents
of
his
pockets
besides
cramming
into
those
of
his
several
articles
that
he
imagined
might
prove
useful
at
that
moment
an
impatient
whistle
from
the
timber
train
that
would
take
him
to
the
landing
warned
him
that
he
had
no
more
time
to
spare
and
snatching
his
hat
he
sprang
down
the
stairway
mrs
trefethen
he
cried
tell
miss
nelly
she
be
turned
out
of
her
own
room
any
longer
and
tell
her
but
never
mind
only
tell
her
that
i
will
have
something
important
to
say
to
her
when
i
come
back
give
her
my
love
and
here
his
words
were
cut
short
by
another
shrill
whistle
from
the
waiting
train
and
peveril
ran
from
the
house
shouting
back
as
he
went
and
leaving
the
good
woman
gasping
with
the
breathless
flurry
of
his
departure
when
nelly
trefethen
reached
home
a
later
she
received
such
a
confused
account
of
what
had
just
happened
as
caused
her
rosy
cheeks
to
take
on
a
deeper
color
and
filled
her
with
a
strange
agitation
peril
had
gone
to
be
a
sailor
and
would
come
back
very
shortly
as
captain
of
a
ship
perhaps
it
would
be
a
splendid
great
steamer
such
as
she
had
seen
lying
at
the
marquette
ore
docks
he
had
left
his
love
for
her
he
would
have
something
of
the
greatest
importance
to
say
the
next
time
he
saw
her
and
she
was
not
to
be
turned
out
of
her
room
again
what
could
he
mean
by
that
and
what
a
very
strange
thing
it
was
for
a
young
man
to
say
since
he
had
said
it
to
her
mother
though
it
must
have
meant
oh
dear
how
she
wished
she
had
not
gone
out
that
morning
and
what
an
endless
time
a
whole
week
seemed
at
length
anxious
to
escape
from
her
mother
torrent
of
words
and
to
be
alone
with
her
own
thoughts
the
blushing
girl
fled
on
the
pretence
of
putting
peril
room
in
order
the
very
first
thing
she
spied
on
entering
the
room
about
which
his
belongings
were
scattered
in
every
direction
was
a
letter
lying
on
the
floor
and
almost
hidden
beneath
the
bed
picking
it
up
she
was
surprised
to
find
it
sealed
and
still
more
so
to
note
that
it
was
addressed
to
richard
how
could
that
be
was
their
guest
living
among
them
under
an
assumed
name
no
of
course
he
would
do
such
a
thing
and
this
letter
must
have
been
handed
to
him
by
mistake
that
was
the
reason
why
he
had
not
opened
it
the
names
were
very
much
alike
in
sound
though
so
differently
spelled
besides
this
letter
was
addressed
in
a
lady
handwriting
and
evidently
came
from
some
foreign
country
she
knew
peril
was
an
american
because
he
had
said
so
he
had
also
told
them
that
he
was
so
far
as
he
knew
without
a
relative
in
the
world
so
there
were
no
sisters
or
young
lady
cousins
to
write
to
him
she
did
not
think
he
could
be
engaged
because
he
had
never
mentioned
the
fact
while
all
the
other
young
men
of
her
acquaintance
were
in
the
habit
of
talking
very
freely
about
their
best
girls
if
they
were
so
fortunate
as
to
have
such
besides
had
not
peril
just
left
his
love
for
and
a
message
to
the
effect
that
he
had
something
very
important
to
tell
she
would
keep
this
hateful
letter
though
and
confront
him
with
it
the
moment
she
saw
him
again
then
his
manner
would
convey
the
information
she
wanted
how
she
did
long
to
open
it
and
just
glance
at
its
contents
the
impulse
to
do
this
was
so
strong
that
only
by
thrusting
the
letter
into
her
pocket
could
she
resist
it
now
the
innocent
cause
of
her
perplexity
seemed
to
burn
like
a
coal
of
fire
until
she
again
drew
it
forth
a
dozen
times
that
day
did
she
do
this
with
the
temptation
to
set
her
doubts
at
rest
by
tearing
open
the
sealed
envelope
always
assailing
her
with
increased
force
finally
to
her
great
relief
an
honorable
way
of
escaping
this
temptation
presented
itself
she
would
return
the
horrid
letter
to
the
from
there
if
it
were
indeed
for
peril
he
would
in
due
course
of
time
receive
it
as
he
had
before
while
if
it
were
intended
for
some
one
else
it
would
be
delivered
to
its
rightful
owner
this
plan
was
no
sooner
conceived
than
executed
and
as
the
troublesome
missive
disappeared
through
the
narrow
slit
of
the
the
girl
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
when
the
very
next
day
that
identical
letter
was
advertised
on
the
bulletin
and
nelly
trefethen
saw
the
notice
she
was
assured
that
she
had
done
the
right
thing
for
ten
days
that
advertisement
stared
her
in
the
face
whenever
she
visited
the
office
and
then
to
her
great
satisfaction
it
disappeared
rose
message
from
across
the
sea
had
gone
to
the
place
of
dead
letters
but
nelly
believed
that
it
had
at
last
found
its
rightful
owner
on
the
very
evening
of
peveril
departure
miss
nelly
old
sweetheart
mike
connell
joined
her
for
a
walk
and
after
much
preliminary
conversation
finally
plucked
up
courage
to
ask
if
peril
had
told
her
anything
of
importance
before
going
away
what
should
he
have
to
tell
me
asked
the
girl
evasively
he
might
have
tould
you
that
he
liked
you
better
than
any
other
girl
in
the
world
was
the
diplomatic
answer
you
know
he
never
say
a
thing
like
that
connell
cried
nelly
blushing
furiously
well
then
he
might
have
said
he
was
already
bespoke
i
do
believe
it
it
true
all
the
same
what
right
have
you
to
say
so
asked
nelly
whose
face
was
now
quite
pale
the
right
of
his
own
words
for
he
telled
me
so
himself
who
is
she
he
did
say
where
does
she
live
then
divil
a
bit
do
i
know
i
do
believe
you
know
anything
at
all
about
it
you
are
just
making
up
a
story
to
tease
me
you
is
the
last
thing
i
be
thinking
of
nelly
darlin
except
it
was
ye
to
marry
me
no
alanna
it
the
truth
telling
you
and
if
you
ca
believe
me
just
ax
him
at
the
same
time
i
sore
hurted
that
ye
should
be
caring
whether
he
bespoke
or
no
i
will
ask
him
answered
the
girl
and
until
i
do
i
thank
you
connell
never
to
mention
peril
name
again
not
even
to
tell
you
what
a
brave
bowld
lad
he
is
and
how
handsome
you
not
be
telling
me
anything
i
do
know
but
darlin
when
he
tells
you
with
his
own
mouth
that
he
already
bespoke
and
not
to
be
had
at
all
you
not
refuse
a
bit
of
hope
to
one
who
loves
the
very
ground
trod
by
your
two
little
feet
connell
here
the
door
and
i
going
in
in
the
meantime
peveril
after
bidding
to
trefethen
had
been
whirled
away
by
the
little
timber
train
to
a
landing
on
the
lake
shore
where
he
found
the
tug
awaiting
him
towing
behind
it
was
a
light
skiff
and
on
its
narrow
deck
he
saw
three
men
dressed
very
much
as
he
was
himself
whom
he
knew
must
be
those
chosen
to
assist
him
in
his
forthcoming
labors
one
of
them
was
a
french
canadian
while
the
others
were
evidently
foreigners
of
the
same
class
as
the
in
the
mine
the
captain
of
the
tug
was
a
yankee
named
spillins
the
latter
glanced
over
the
note
from
major
arkell
that
the
handed
him
and
said
all
right
peril
if
you
ready
for
a
start
i
am
yes
replied
peveril
i
ready
and
in
another
minute
they
were
off
as
they
got
under
way
the
young
leader
of
the
expedition
walked
aft
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
his
men
he
was
annoyed
to
find
that
while
two
of
them
were
brawny
fellows
who
looked
well
fit
for
work
they
could
not
muster
a
dozen
words
of
english
between
them
noting
his
efforts
to
converse
with
them
the
third
man
who
introduced
himself
as
joe
pintaud
came
to
his
assistance
no
goot
you
talk
to
dem
dago
feller
mist
pearl
he
said
zey
can
spik
ze
anglais
no
more
as
woodchuck
you
tell
lazy
scoundrel
zey
onstan
pret
goot
but
by
gar
you
talk
lak
white
man
you
got
kick
it
in
hees
head
realizing
the
truth
of
joe
pintaud
words
peveril
left
the
others
to
a
stolid
smoking
of
their
pipes
and
sought
whatever
information
their
more
intelligent
companion
had
to
give
concerning
their
present
undertaking
he
quickly
discovered
that
while
joe
was
as
ignorant
as
himself
of
that
coast
he
was
an
expert
raftsman
and
logger
he
also
found
that
the
tug
carried
a
good
supply
of
rope
axes
and
other
things
necessary
for
the
work
in
hand
after
having
satisfied
himself
on
these
points
peveril
gazed
for
a
while
at
the
bleak
coast
along
which
they
were
running
and
then
suddenly
bethinking
himself
of
a
pleasure
that
he
had
reserved
for
a
leisure
moment
he
entered
the
and
sitting
down
on
a
cushioned
locker
behind
captain
spillins
who
stood
at
the
wheel
began
to
feel
in
his
pockets
as
he
did
this
his
movements
grew
more
and
more
impatient
until
finally
with
a
muttered
exclamation
he
turned
the
entire
contents
of
his
pockets
out
on
the
cushion
lost
something
asked
the
captain
looking
around
yes
not
your
money
i
hope
no
but
a
letter
that
was
worth
more
to
me
than
all
the
money
in
the
world
whew
whistled
the
captain
must
have
been
important
chapter
xii
a
vision
of
the
cliffs
rose
bonnifay
had
acted
more
from
impulse
than
from
real
feeling
when
she
consented
to
become
engaged
to
richard
peveril
as
a
popular
oxford
man
and
stroke
of
the
eight
he
was
a
hero
to
attract
almost
any
girl
his
wealth
was
by
no
means
to
be
despised
and
it
would
certainly
be
a
fine
thing
to
have
him
in
devoted
attendance
during
her
proposed
trip
to
norway
she
was
greatly
disappointed
at
his
failure
to
rejoin
them
and
wondered
what
he
could
mean
by
announcing
the
loss
of
his
fortune
when
he
was
still
the
owner
of
a
miss
rose
said
gold
to
herself
because
while
peveril
had
not
specified
the
character
of
his
property
she
imagined
all
western
mines
to
be
of
course
too
their
owners
must
be
wealthy
so
she
hoped
for
the
best
and
while
realizing
that
she
was
not
at
all
in
love
determined
to
let
her
engagement
hold
good
for
the
present
under
the
circumstances
she
felt
that
this
decision
was
very
creditable
to
her
loyalty
which
however
was
sadly
shaken
by
first
gossipy
letter
from
new
york
with
its
disquieting
news
still
fresh
in
her
mind
she
received
a
second
that
completely
dispelled
her
illusions
and
caused
her
to
wonder
how
she
could
ever
have
been
so
foolish
as
to
engage
herself
to
a
man
of
whom
she
knew
so
little
this
second
letter
which
contained
the
cruel
distortion
of
facts
penned
by
owen
in
red
jacket
followed
the
bonnifays
to
norway
where
it
was
received
acting
on
the
impulse
acquired
by
reading
it
rose
immediately
sat
down
and
wrote
to
peveril
the
letter
that
reached
him
in
due
course
of
time
but
which
he
lost
without
even
having
broken
its
seal
he
had
joyfully
recognized
the
handwriting
of
its
address
but
was
at
the
same
time
puzzled
to
know
how
rose
could
have
learned
his
present
now
he
was
filled
with
consternation
at
his
carelessness
of
course
though
he
must
have
dropped
the
letter
while
transferring
the
contents
of
his
pockets
and
he
would
surely
find
it
again
upon
his
return
to
the
trefethen
cottage
at
laughing
fish
cove
the
party
was
landed
shortly
after
noon
near
a
fishing
settlement
of
half
a
dozen
huts
that
stood
in
an
irregular
row
on
the
beach
a
few
slatternly
women
and
twice
their
number
of
children
were
the
sole
occupants
of
the
place
for
its
men
were
away
on
the
lake
tending
their
nets
again
was
peveril
disappointed
to
learn
from
the
appearance
and
conversation
of
these
people
that
they
also
were
foreigners
speaking
a
language
unintelligible
to
him
though
evidently
comprehended
by
two
of
his
men
captain
spillins
explained
that
uninviting
as
the
place
looked
it
was
one
of
the
very
few
harbors
on
that
rugged
coast
in
which
the
logs
of
which
peveril
was
in
search
could
be
rafted
and
held
in
safety
until
called
for
so
the
stores
and
supplies
were
landed
and
after
the
tug
had
steamed
away
peveril
set
his
men
at
work
building
a
camp
and
collecting
firewood
while
he
took
the
skiff
for
an
exploration
of
the
adjacent
coast
on
the
south
side
of
laughing
fish
cove
he
found
logs
bearing
the
letters
strewn
for
miles
along
the
shore
and
piled
in
every
conceivable
position
among
the
rocks
on
which
they
had
been
hurled
by
furious
seas
as
he
studied
the
situation
our
young
foresaw
an
immense
amount
of
labor
in
dislodging
these
and
getting
them
once
more
afloat
besides
those
on
the
rocks
he
discovered
a
number
on
the
beach
of
the
cove
that
could
easily
be
got
into
the
water
but
all
that
he
thus
saw
formed
only
about
of
what
had
been
contained
in
the
great
raft
the
remainder
must
then
be
found
somewhere
to
the
northward
of
laughing
fish
and
accordingly
late
in
the
afternoon
he
headed
his
skiff
in
that
direction
the
coast
that
he
now
skirted
was
very
wild
but
grandly
beautiful
with
precipitous
cliffs
brilliant
in
the
reds
and
greens
of
mineral
stains
and
surmounted
by
a
dense
growth
of
firs
among
which
were
set
groups
of
white
birches
at
the
base
of
the
cliffs
and
amid
the
detached
masses
fallen
from
them
the
waters
plashed
softly
and
an
occasional
in
iridescent
plumage
swam
hurriedly
from
his
course
with
anxious
backward
glances
in
the
upper
air
nesting
gulls
in
spotless
white
darted
to
and
fro
noting
his
movements
with
keen
red
eyes
he
found
some
logs
near
the
cove
but
the
farther
he
went
from
it
the
scarcer
they
became
until
finally
he
passed
a
mile
or
more
of
coast
without
seeing
one
strange
muttered
the
young
man
what
can
have
become
of
them
there
are
hundreds
still
missing
and
they
should
be
somewhere
in
this
vicinity
he
was
paddling
almost
without
a
sound
and
skirting
a
ledge
of
black
rocks
that
jutted
well
out
into
the
lake
as
he
spoke
at
that
same
moment
something
impelled
him
to
glance
upward
and
encounter
a
vision
startling
in
its
unexpectedness
on
the
very
face
of
the
cliff
some
twenty
feet
above
the
water
and
leaning
slightly
forward
stood
a
girlish
figure
gazing
directly
at
him
with
great
wondering
eyes
for
an
instant
she
seemed
to
read
his
very
soul
then
a
vivid
flush
sprang
to
her
cheeks
and
with
a
quick
movement
she
disappeared
as
though
the
solid
rock
had
opened
to
receive
her
peveril
rubbed
his
eyes
and
looked
again
she
certainly
was
not
there
nor
could
he
discover
the
slightest
indication
of
an
opening
through
which
she
could
have
vanished
yet
even
as
he
looked
a
pebble
leaped
apparently
from
the
unbroken
face
of
the
cliff
and
dropped
with
a
clatter
to
the
ledge
close
beside
him
he
paddled
farther
out
into
the
lake
but
still
failed
to
discover
any
aperture
he
moved
for
short
distances
both
up
and
down
the
coast
without
any
better
success
to
be
sure
a
stunted
cedar
growing
out
from
the
rocky
face
near
where
the
girl
had
disappeared
showed
the
existence
of
either
a
crevice
or
ledge
and
she
might
have
concealed
herself
behind
it
though
peveril
did
not
believe
she
had
even
if
she
were
thus
hidden
how
had
she
gained
that
perilous
position
how
would
she
escape
from
it
who
was
she
and
where
had
she
come
from
she
was
not
one
of
the
from
the
cove
of
that
he
was
certain
neither
was
she
an
indian
girl
for
the
face
indelibly
pictured
in
his
memory
was
fair
and
refined
it
had
not
struck
him
as
being
beautiful
except
for
the
glorious
eyes
that
had
looked
so
fully
into
his
he
called
several
times
are
you
in
trouble
can
i
help
you
but
only
mocking
echoes
and
the
harsh
screams
of
a
flock
of
gulls
circling
about
the
very
place
where
he
had
seen
her
came
to
him
in
answer
he
sought
for
some
means
of
scaling
the
cliff
but
found
none
everywhere
it
was
smooth
and
sheer
never
in
his
life
had
the
young
man
been
so
baffled
and
never
so
loath
to
own
himself
beaten
but
he
was
at
length
warned
by
the
setting
of
the
sun
to
give
over
his
quest
and
row
vigorously
back
the
way
he
had
come
twilight
was
merging
into
darkness
when
he
again
entered
laughing
fish
cove
but
a
bright
fire
on
the
beach
served
at
once
as
a
beacon
and
a
promise
of
good
cheer
a
comfortable
cabin
of
poles
and
bark
had
been
built
by
the
men
during
his
absence
in
it
were
all
the
stores
as
well
as
a
quantity
of
spruce
boughs
and
hemlock
tips
for
bedding
the
chill
evening
air
was
filled
with
a
delicious
fragrance
of
burning
cedar
mingled
with
the
pleasant
odor
of
boiling
coffee
several
nailed
to
oak
planks
were
browning
before
a
bed
of
glowing
coals
while
slices
of
a
were
sizzling
together
with
bits
of
bacon
in
the
supper
was
ready
as
joe
who
superintended
the
culinary
operations
announced
with
a
shout
the
moment
peveril
skiff
grated
on
the
beach
several
of
the
were
lighted
others
had
bright
fires
blazing
outside
their
doors
the
boats
had
returned
and
there
was
a
pleasant
bustle
about
the
little
settlement
peveril
did
not
mention
the
perplexing
vision
he
had
seen
that
afternoon
though
it
continually
haunted
him
and
a
decided
zest
was
given
to
his
work
of
the
coming
week
by
the
thought
of
this
mystery
as
he
lay
on
his
couch
of
fragrant
boughs
that
evening
planning
how
to
solve
it
he
almost
forgot
his
unhappiness
of
the
morning
and
a
little
later
a
new
face
had
found
its
way
into
his
dreams
chapter
xiii
and
smugglers
there
were
no
laggards
in
the
camp
on
the
following
morning
for
with
the
stars
still
shining
peveril
routed
out
his
men
from
their
fragrant
couches
leaving
joe
pintaud
to
prepare
breakfast
he
and
the
two
bohemians
began
to
form
their
raft
by
rolling
to
the
water
edge
setting
afloat
and
securing
such
logs
as
lay
nearest
at
hand
while
the
wreckers
were
thus
engaged
the
fishermen
appeared
from
their
huts
and
made
ready
for
another
day
on
the
lake
they
were
an
set
and
peveril
was
not
pleased
to
note
that
they
seemed
to
make
sneering
remarks
concerning
the
task
on
which
he
was
engaged
beneath
their
jeers
his
own
men
grew
so
surly
and
restless
that
he
was
relieved
when
joe
called
them
to
breakfast
after
that
all
hands
set
forth
in
the
skiff
to
work
at
the
logs
stranded
along
the
coast
to
the
southward
as
they
pulled
out
of
the
cove
peveril
noticed
that
a
small
schooner
which
he
had
believed
belonged
to
the
fishermen
was
still
at
anchor
and
that
the
crew
lounging
about
her
deck
were
of
a
different
class
from
those
who
had
already
gone
out
he
was
about
to
call
joe
attention
to
this
when
that
individual
hailed
the
schooner
and
began
to
carry
on
a
lively
conversation
with
her
men
when
they
had
passed
beyond
hearing
peveril
questioned
the
canadian
concerning
the
strange
craft
and
was
told
that
she
was
not
a
but
a
trader
what
does
she
trade
in
plenty
cognac
seelk

contemptuously

but
not
ze

here
the
conversation
was
ended
by
the
arrival
at
the
scene
of
labor
and
the
work
of
dislodging
stranded
logs
was
begun
all
day
long
they
toiled
at
the
difficult
task
straining
lifting
stumbling
rolling
and
slipping
on
the
wet
rocks
receiving
many
a
bump
and
bruise
pausing
only
for
a
bite
of
lunch
and
a
whiff
of
at
noon
and
finally
returning
to
laughing
fish
at
dusk
slowly
towing
into
the
cove
a
small
raft
of
the
recovered
wreckage
for
several
days
longer
sometimes
in
clear
weather
but
often
in
cheerless
rain
and
fog
was
the
task
of
collecting
such
logs
as
had
stranded
on
the
south
side
of
the
cove
continued
at
length
the
last
one
was
gathered
from
that
direction
and
our
wreckers
were
ready
to
explore
the
coast
lying
to
the
northward
not
since
the
day
of
his
coming
had
peveril
found
leisure
to
revisit
the
place
where
he
had
seen
the
mysterious
figure
of
the
cliffs
he
had
thought
often
of
her
and
had
so
longed
to
return
to
that
part
of
the
coast
that
only
a
strict
sense
of
duty
had
prevented
him
now
that
he
was
free
to
unravel
the
mystery
if
he
could
he
was
as
excited
as
a
boy
off
for
a
holiday
he
purposed
gathering
the
few
logs
already
seen
on
that
side
of
the
cove
and
then
to
continue
his
exploration
indefinitely
in
search
of
others
but
to
his
amazement
as
they
skirted
the
rugged
coast
not
a
log
was
to
be
found
in
vain
did
the
young
leader
stand
up
in
his
boat
the
better
to
scan
every
inch
of
the
shore
in
vain
did
he
land
on
the
rocks
and
scramble
over
their
broken
surface
there
were
no
logs
and
yet
he
knew
they
had
been
there
five
days
earlier
nor
had
there
been
any
storm
during
that
time
to
dislodge
them
joe
your
smuggling
friends
must
have
taken
them
non
he
gat
plenty
log
in
canada
him
what
then
has
become
of
them
dunno
maybe
dev
catch
him
it
is
a
human
devil
of
some
kind
then
and
he
must
have
carried
them
still
farther
up
the
coast
for
we
should
have
seen
them
if
they
had
been
carried
the
other
way
oui
give
way
men
i
going
to
find
those
logs
if
they
are
anywhere
on
keweenaw
point
so
the
light
skiff
shot
ahead
with
the
two
bohemians
rowing
and
the
others
in
bow
and
stern
watching
the
coast
sharply
as
they
slipped
past
its
rocky
front
they
were
already
beyond
any
point
at
which
peveril
had
previously
discovered
logs
and
were
rapidly
approaching
the
place
of
his
mystery
he
could
see
the
jutting
ledge
and
was
eagerly
scanning
the
cliffs
above
it
when
suddenly
joe
held
up
his
hand
with
a
warning
hist
without
a
word
peveril
gave
the
signal
to
stop
rowing
which
was
instantly
obeyed
in
the
silence
that
followed
they
heard
a
sound
of
singing
it
was
a
plaintive
melody
sung
in
a
girlish
voice
untrained
but
full
and
sweet
to
his
amazement
peveril
recognized
it
as
one
of
the
very
latest
songs
of
a
popular
composer
whose
music
he
had
supposed
almost
unknown
in
america
the
voice
also
seemed
to
be
close
at
hand
at
first
the
men
gazed
about
them
with
an
idle
curiosity
but
not
seeing
anyone
they
began
to
grow
uneasy
and
to
cast
frightened
glances
on
every
side
by
gar
exclaimed
joe
pintaud
and
on
the
instant
the
singing
ceased
the
sudden
silence
was
almost
as
disquieting
as
the
voice
of
an
invisible
singer
and
again
joe
uttered
his
favorite
exclamation
where
did
that
voice
come
from
dunno

i
could
also
have
sworn
that
it
rose
from
the
water
oui
you
say
dev
i
say
dev
by
this
time
peveril
had
again
got
his
craft
under
way
and
they
were
skirting
a
wooded
islet
that
lay
off
the
coast
just
beyond
the
black
ledge
this
island
appeared
to
be
nearly
cut
in
two
by
a
narrow
bay
but
as
those
in
the
boat
seemed
to
see
every
part
of
this
and
were
convinced
that
it
contained
no
logs
they
did
not
enter
it
the
young
leader
was
not
giving
much
thought
to
either
logs
or
his
immediate
surroundings
just
then
for
his
ears
were
still
filled
with
the
music
that
had
come
to
him
as
mysteriously
as
had
the
vision
of
a
few
days
earlier
so
lost
was
he
in
reflection
that
he
started
abruptly
when
the
rowing
again
ceased
and
one
of
the
men
whispered
hoarsely
mist
pearl
look
he
was
pointing
back
from
where
they
had
come
and
turning
peveril
saw
apparently
gliding
from
the
very
shore
of
the
island
they
had
just
passed
a
small
schooner
she
must
have
sailed
from
the
bay
into
which
they
had
gazed
and
yet
they
believed
they
had
scrutinized
every
inch
of
its
surface
by
gar
cried
joe
pintaud
some
more
dev
hein
it
looks
to
me
like
the
boat
of
your
friends
the
smugglers

peveril

the
vessel

go
and
see
where
she
came
from
for
so
snug
a
is
worth
discovering
so
the
skiff
was
put
about
and
rowed
back
to
the
little
bay
bisecting
the
island
then
it
was
found
that
there
were
two
small
islands
and
that
the
supposed
bay
was
really
an
inlet
from
the
lake
which
made
a
sharp
angle
at
a
point
invisible
from
outside
this
channel
led
to
a
narrow
sound
from
which
another
inlet
cut
directly
into
the
coast
it
was
quite
short
and
quickly
widened
into
an
exquisite
basin
completely
and
very
nearly
circular
peveril
had
followed
this
devious
course
with
all
the
eagerness
of
an
explorer
but
his
men
had
cast
many
nervous
glances
over
their
shoulders
and
even
joe
pintaud
had
expressed
a
muttered
hope
that
they
were
not
being
led
into
some
trap
as
the
skiff
emerged
from
the
inlet
and
shot
into
the
smiling
basin
an
exclamation
burst
from
all
four
men
at
once
ze
log
cried
joe
our
logs
echoed
peveril
the
others
probably
used
words
meaning
the
same
thing
at
any
rate
they
talked
excitedly
and
pointed
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
basin
where
was
moored
a
raft
of
logs
two
men
with
a
yoke
of
oxen
were
in
the
act
of
hauling
one
of
these
from
the
water
and
a
deeply
marked
trail
leading
up
the
bank
to
a
point
of
disappearance
showed
where
a
number
of
its
predecessors
had
gone
give
way
cried
peveril
and
the
skiff
sped
across
the
basin
as
it
ranged
alongside
the
moored
raft
the
young
leader
recognized
the
mark
of
the
white
pine
mine
on
one
floating
stick
after
another
hold
on
he
shouted
where
are
you
going
with
that
log
none
of
your
business
answered
one
of
the
two
men
who
was
old
and
what
are
you
doing
here
anyway
i
come
after
these
logs
well
you
ca
have
them
and
you
want
to
get
out
of
here
quicker
than
you
came
in
with
this
the
man
spoke
a
few
words
to
his
assistant
who
immediately
ran
up
the
trail
and
disappeared
while
peveril
with
a
hot
flush
mounting
to
his
forehead
ordered
his
crew
to
pull
for
the
shore
chapter
xiv
a
vain
effort
to
recover
stolen
property
leaping
ashore
the
moment
his
skiff
grated
on
the
beach
peveril
stepped
directly
up
to
the
old
man
and
said
i
do
not
know
who
you
are
sir
nor
what
claim
you
make
to
ownership
in
those
logs
i
do
know
however
that
they
bear
the
private
mark
of
the
white
pine
mining
company
and
formed
part
of
a
raft
recently
wrecked
on
this
coast
having
been
sent
here
expressly
to
secure
this
property
i
am
determined
to
use
every
endeavor
to
carry
out
my
instructions
such
being
the
case
i
trust
that
you
will
not
interfere
with
the
performance
of
my
duty
i
shall
though
answered
the
old
man
gruffly
i
have
need
of
this
timber
and
consider
that
i
have
a
just
claim
to
it
seeing
that
it
was
cast
up
by
the
sea
on
my
land
i
have
also
expended
a
great
amount
of
labor
in
bringing
it
to
this
place
so
that
if
i
had
no
other
claim
i
have
one
for
salvage
which
will
doubtless
be
allowed
when
presented
in
proper
form
replied
peveril
in
the
meantime
i
am
ordered
to
take
possession
of
all
logs
that
i
may
find
bearing
the
p
mark
supposing
i
forbid
you
to
do
so
i
am
also
authorized
to
use
force
if
necessary
to
carry
out
my
instructions
that
sounds
very
much
like
a
threat
my
young
friend
but
i
decline
to
be
frightened
by
it
and
still
forbid
you
to
touch
those
logs
joe
pintaud
had
followed
his
young
leader
ashore
and
stood
close
beside
him
during
the
foregoing
interview
while
the
bohemians
still
remained
in
the
skiff
now
without
deigning
any
further
reply
to
the
old
man
peveril
in
a
low
tone
ordered
the
canadian
to
provide
himself
and
the
others
with
poles
and
if
possible
shove
the
raft
off
from
shore
adding
that
he
would
join
in
their
efforts
the
moment
he
had
cast
loose
its
moorings
as
joe
started
to
obey
these
instructions
peveril
ran
to
the
farther
of
two
ropes
holding
the
raft
and
unfastened
it
while
he
did
this
the
old
man
stood
without
remonstrance
but
with
a
cynical
smile
on
his
thin
lips
finding
himself
uninterrupted
peveril
fancied
that
no
resistance
was
to
be
offered
after
all
and
with
the
carelessness
of
confidence
stooped
to
cast
off
the
remaining
line
the
next
instant
a
nervous
shove
from
behind
sent
him
headforemost
into
the
lake
just
then
there
came
a
rush
of
feet
and
as
peveril
by
his
sudden
bath
in
the
icy
water
rose
to
the
surface
and
attempted
to
regain
the
bank
he
was
seized
by
half
a
dozen
pair
of
brawny
hands
belonging
to
as
many
men
who
had
been
summoned
from
beyond
the
ridge
in
another
minute
the
young
wrecker
was
lying
in
the
bottom
of
his
own
skiff
and
it
was
being
towed
out
to
sea
by
a
second
boat
manned
by
two
lusty
foreigners
in
its
sat
the
old
man
holding
a
cocked
revolver
from
which
he
threatened
to
put
a
bullet
through
peveril
head
if
he
lifted
it
above
the
gunwale
under
the
circumstances
the
latter
though
raging
at
his
sudden
discomfiture
deemed
it
best
to
lie
still
and
await
with
what
patience
he
might
the
result
of
his
misadventure
so
he
was
towed
for
a
long
distance
and
when
his
skiff
finally
seemed
to
have
lost
motion
and
be
drifting
he
ventured
to
lift
his
head
before
he
could
see
over
the
side
there
came
the
sharp
report
of
a
pistol
a
bullet
whistled
close
above
him
and
he
was
ordered
to
remain
quiet
until
he
received
permission
to
sit
up
peveril
obeyed
and
for
nearly
half
an
hour
longer
lay
motionless
then
his
craft
struck
bottom
and
he
sprang
up
in
alarm
he
was
alone
and
his
skiff
was
bumping
against
a
black
ledge
that
he
recognized
as
the
one
lying
at
the
foot
of
the
mysterious
cliff
not
a
boat
was
to
be
seen
but
on
the
rocks
close
at
hand
lay
the
oars
that
had
been
taken
from
his
skiff
when
he
was
thrown
into
it
they
were
not
lying
together
but
at
some
distance
apart
as
though
flung
there
but
whether
from
a
boat
or
from
some
other
direction
he
could
not
tell
at
any
rate
he
was
thankful
to
have
them
and
at
once
began
to
plan
how
he
should
use
them
in
connection
with
his
regained
liberty
at
first
his
indignation
at
his
recent
treatment
suggested
that
he
row
back
and
attempt
at
least
to
recover
his
men
but
a
reflection
showed
the
folly
of
such
a
scheme
not
only
would
he
again
be
confronted
by
an
overpowering
number
of
opponents
but
it
was
probable
that
his
men
were
even
then
on
their
way
overland
to
laughing
fish
for
he
did
not
believe
the
old
man
would
dare
hold
them
prisoners
at
any
rate
it
would
be
best
to
rejoin
them
before
planning
to
gain
possession
of
the
logs
in
the
basin
upon
which
he
was
still
determined
although
the
young
man
did
not
know
it
he
was
keenly
watched
during
these
moments
of
indecision
by
a
pair
of
bright
eyes
that
peered
down
from
the
cliff
above
him
when
he
shiveringly
his
skiff
the
eyes
were
hastily
withdrawn
lest
he
should
look
up
a
little
later
a
young
girl
of
slight
figure
clad
in
a
dark
gown
stepped
out
from
the
cliff
as
from
behind
a
curtain
and
half
concealed
by
the
stunted
cedar
watched
him
curiously
until
he
was
lost
to
view
he
is
ever
so
different
from
an
ordinary
miner
she
soliloquized
and
looks
as
though
he
might
be
interesting
i
wonder
if
i
shall
ever
see
him
again
i
am
glad
i
thought
of
getting
these
oars
and
throwing
them
down
even
if
he
has
used
them
to
go
away
with
what
will
papa
think
when
he
finds
them
gone
anyhow
the
monotony
of
this
stupid
place
has
been
broken
at
last
and
now
perhaps
something
else
will
happen
i
believe
something
must
be
going
to
happen
very
soon
anyhow
from
the
way
papa
talks
dear
papa
how
queerly
he
acts
and
how
i
wish
i
could
see
him
happy
just
once
now
i
must
go
and
tell
him
that
the
schooner
is
coming
with
this
the
girl
apparently
performed
a
miracle
for
she
seemed
to
push
aside
a
portion
of
the
cliff
and
disappear
behind
it
without
leaving
a
trace
of
an
opening
as
peveril
rowed
steadily
down
the
coast
he
saw
in
the
distance
a
schooner
that
he
believed
to
be
the
one
belonging
to
joe
friends
beating
up
from
the
southward
for
a
moment
he
thought
of
trying
to
board
her
but
quickly
dismissing
the
idea
doggedly
pursued
his
way
arrived
at
the
cove
he
was
disappointed
to
find
his
camp
vacant
and
without
a
sign
that
his
coming
companions
had
returned
to
it
building
a
fire
he
made
a
pot
of
coffee
and
prepared
to
await
their
coming
with
what
patience
he
could
command
some
of
the
came
and
watched
him
shyly
but
when
he
attempted
to
draw
them
into
conversation
they
only
laughed
and
ran
away
feeling
very
lonely
and
undecided
as
to
what
he
should
do
he
had
just
begun
to
eat
a
lunch
of
cold
food
prepared
by
joe
that
morning
when
a
plan
occurred
to
him
it
was
to
set
forth
on
foot
to
meet
his
men
failing
to
do
which
he
could
at
least
spy
out
the
strength
i
can
discover
too
what
lies
behind
that
ridge
and
where
they
are
carrying
those
logs
he
said
half
aloud
illustration
the
men
hastily
threw
peveril
into
the
bushes
so
impatient
was
he
to
put
this
plan
into
execution
that
he
would
not
wait
to
finish
his
lunch
but
swallowing
a
mug
of
coffee
and
stuffing
a
few
hard
biscuit
into
the
ample
pockets
of
his
now
nearly
dry
coat
he
set
forth
coming
across
a
though
narrow
trail
leading
in
what
he
believed
to
be
the
right
direction
he
turned
into
it
and
followed
it
briskly
for
several
miles
it
was
by
this
time
late
afternoon
and
long
shadows
were
creeping
over
the
rugged
upland
country
that
he
traversed
no
house
was
to
be
seen
nor
evidence
of
human
occupation
all
the
large
timber
having
been
long
since
cut
off
the
region
was
now
covered
with
a
ragged
second
growth
and
thick
underbrush
extensive
tracts
had
been
burned
over
and
thousands
of
small
trees
standing
in
the
melancholy
attitudes
of
death
added
to
the
desolation
of
the
scene
every
now
and
then
he
passed
yawning
offering
mute
evidence
of
disappointed
hopes
at
length
he
caught
a
whiff
of
smoke
a
dull
clang
of
machinery
came
to
his
ears
and
with
curiosity
keenly
aroused
he
pursued
his
way
more
cautiously
a
few
minutes
later
he
reached
a
point
where
he
caught
glimpses
of
buildings
evidently
belonging
to
a
mine
a
tall
was
surrounded
by
various
shops
and
a
cluster
of
dwellings
most
of
them
very
humble
in
appearance
though
one
was
large
and
pretentious
although
smoke
was
curling
lazily
from
a
lofty
stack
that
he
imagined
belonged
to
an
and
though
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
noise
as
of
machinery
in
motion
there
were
no
other
signs
of
activity
about
the
place
in
fact
it
was
pervaded
by
an
aspect
of
desolation
and
desertion
there
were
no
hurrying
men
nor
teams
most
of
the
buildings
appeared
to
be
permanently
closed
doors
were
boarded
up
windows
were
broken
and
the
smaller
dwellings
were
almost
hidden
by
the
rank
growth
of
weeds
and
bushes
that
closely
surrounded
them
as
peveril
stared
in
perplexity
at
this
melancholy
picture
his
attention
was
attracted
by
a
sound
of
voices
near
at
hand
he
gazed
eagerly
and
even
took
a
few
steps
forward
hoping
to
meet
his
own
party
but
was
grievously
disappointed
to
see
instead
a
group
of
three
burly
strangers
clad
in
mining
costume
as
they
drew
near
he
recognized
them
to
be
bohemians
and
was
particularly
struck
by
the
hideous
expression
of
him
who
seemed
to
act
as
leader
of
the
party
although
the
started
at
sight
of
the
young
man
and
regarded
him
with
scowling
faces
as
they
drew
near
they
did
not
speak
nor
offer
to
molest
him
but
passed
by
in
silence
disappointed
that
they
were
not
his
own
men
but
relieved
to
be
so
easily
rid
of
them
peveril
again
turned
his
attention
to
the
mining
village
that
had
so
aroused
his
curiosity
so
deeply
interested
did
he
at
once
become
in
watching
a
team
of
oxen
that
had
just
appeared
hauling
a
log
over
a
rise
of
ground
that
he
did
not
hear
the
approach
of
stealthy
footsteps
nor
note
the
crouching
forms
creeping
up
behind
him
closer
and
closer
they
came
until
they
were
within
reach
of
their
unconscious
victim
then
they
sprang
upon
him
all
at
once
and
he
was
hurled
to
the
ground
in
another
moment
his
arms
were
bound
and
he
recognized
in
one
distorted
face
leering
close
above
his
own
that
of
the
man
who
had
led
the
attack
on
him
in
the
mine
and
whom
he
had
sent
reeling
away
with
a
broken
jaw
now
the
cruel
face
was
rendered
doubly
hideous
by
a
grin
of
triumph
and
peveril
heart
sank
within
him
as
he
gazed
into
the
pitiless
eyes
that
lighted
its
brutish
features
chapter
xv
peveril
in
the
hands
of
his
enemies
having
been
driven
from
red
jacket
by
the
cornishmen
under
mark
trefethen
the
bohemian
rothsky
and
his
fellow
of
the
white
pine
mine
who
had
assaulted
peveril
on
his
first
day
of
work
had
taken
to
the
woods
like
wild
beasts
although
restrained
of
their
evil
intentions
for
the
time
being
they
were
more
bitter
than
ever
against
the
innocent
cause
of
their
trouble
and
swore
with
strange
foreign
oaths
to
kill
him
if
the
chance
should
ever
offer
in
the
meantime
they
must
find
some
way
of
gaining
a
livelihood
and
this
finally
came
to
them
at
a
queer
mine
across
which
they
stumbled
in
the
course
of
their
wanderings
its
proprietor
was
an
old
man
who
seemed
half
crazed
and
the
mine
that
he
was
working
in
a
small
way
with
a
pitifully
inadequate
force
was
absolutely
barren
of
copper
but
as
he
paid
their
wages
promptly
the
were
willing
to
do
his
bidding
without
asking
questions
one
of
the
scarcest
things
about
this
mine
was
timber
with
which
to
support
the
roof
of
the
only
drift
that
was
being
opened
the
proprietor
tried
to
force
his
men
to
continue
their
work
and
open
the
drift
far
beyond
a
point
of
safety
without
the
protection
of
this
most
necessary
adjunct
and
when
they
refused
he
became
furiously
angry
their
job
seemed
to
have
come
to
an
end
and
all
hands
were
about
to
leave
when
by
an
opportune
gale
a
supply
of
the
desired
material
was
cast
up
on
the
adjacent
coast
every
man
was
immediately
set
to
work
collecting
this
and
in
towing
raft
after
raft
of
the
logs
to
a
basin
that
lay
but
a
short
distance
from
the
mine
in
this
way
even
before
the
arrival
of
peveril
and
his
wreckers
a
large
amount
of
the
needed
timber
had
been
secured
although
the
miners
were
well
aware
that
their
employer
carried
on
some
other
business
besides
the
development
of
his
barren
property
they
neither
knew
nor
cared
to
know
what
it
was
they
discovered
that
it
was
in
some
way
connected
with
the
coming
and
going
of
certain
vessels
but
beyond
this
they
were
kept
in
ignorance
when
one
of
these
vessels
reported
a
party
at
laughing
fish
also
engaged
in
a
search
for
wrecked
logs
the
exertions
of
the
were
so
redoubled
that
before
peveril
found
time
to
work
the
coast
to
the
northward
of
his
camp
it
had
been
stripped
of
every
log
having
obtained
possession
of
his
coveted
timber
the
old
man
was
now
making
every
effort
to
have
it
transported
to
the
mouth
of
his
shaft
believing
that
if
he
could
once
get
it
underground
his
right
to
the
logs
would
remain
unquestioned
he
had
however
only
partially
succeeded
in
effecting
this
removal
when
to
his
chagrin
peveril
appeared
on
the
scene
of
activity
after
the
defeat
of
the
young
man
attempt
to
capture
the
raft
his
two
bohemians
were
easily
induced
to
join
the
enemy
by
promises
of
better
pay
than
they
were
getting
as
for
joe
pintaud
he
was
indeed
taken
prisoner
but
was
purposely
so
loosely
guarded
that
he
found
no
difficulty
in
escaping
to
the
schooner
of
his
friends
which
came
into
port
that
afternoon
and
on
which
he
was
carried
off
to
canada
thus
was
the
white
pine
wrecking
expedition
completely
broken
up
and
only
its
leader
was
left
to
carry
out
if
he
could
its
objects
even
he
had
been
set
adrift
in
an
oarless
skiff
with
the
hope
that
he
would
be
so
long
delayed
in
reporting
to
his
employers
as
to
allow
time
for
the
captured
logs
to
be
put
underground
before
another
demand
for
them
could
be
made
this
disposition
of
the
captive
was
only
known
to
the
old
man
who
had
unobserved
removed
the
oars
from
peveril
skiff
and
so
it
was
generally
supposed
that
he
would
return
directly
to
his
camp
at
laughing
fish
rothsky
the
bohemian
who
was
one
of
those
working
near
the
log
raft
had
instantly
recognized
peveril
and
at
sight
of
him
his
hatred
blazed
up
with
redoubled
fury
to
be
sure
his
broken
jaw
had
healed
but
so
awry
as
to
disfigure
his
face
and
render
it
more
hideous
than
ever
now
to
find
the
man
who
had
done
him
this
injury
again
interfering
with
his
plans
filled
him
with
rage
although
he
had
no
opportunity
for
venting
it
at
the
moment
he
easily
learned
from
peveril
late
followers
the
location
of
their
camp
and
believing
that
the
young
man
would
be
found
there
he
planned
an
attack
upon
it
for
that
very
night
he
had
no
difficulty
in
inducing
the
two
other
who
had
been
driven
from
the
white
pine
to
join
him
and
as
soon
as
they
quit
work
that
evening
they
set
forth
on
foot
they
had
not
settled
on
any
plan
of
action
and
though
rothsky
was
determined
to
kill
the
man
he
hated
his
associates
imagined
that
the
young
fellow
was
only
to
be
punished
in
such
a
way
as
would
cause
him
a
considerable
degree
of
suffering
and
at
the
same
time
afford
them
great
amusement
they
did
not
anticipate
any
interference
with
their
plans
even
should
they
be
discovered
for
the
fishermen
of
the
cove
were
their
bound
to
them
by
the
ties
of
a
common
hatred
against
all
americans
now
it
so
happened
that
the
only
daughter
of
the
erratic
old
had
set
forth
that
afternoon
accompanied
only
by
her
a
great
lean
on
a
long
gallop
over
the
wild
uplands
surrounding
her
home
for
that
desolate
little
mining
village
was
the
only
home
mary
darrell
had
known
since
the
death
of
her
mother
five
years
before
or
when
she
was
but
twelve
years
of
age
until
then
she
had
lived
in
new
england
and
had
only
seen
her
father
upon
the
rare
occasions
of
his
visits
from
the
mysterious
west
in
which
his
life
was
spent
to
others
he
was
a
man
of
morose
silence
suspicious
of
his
fellows
secretive
and
unapproachable
but
to
his
only
child
the
one
light
of
his
darkened
life
and
the
sole
hope
of
his
old
age
he
was
ever
the
loving
father
tender
and
indulgent
bringing
her
to
the
only
home
he
had
to
offer
he
had
made
all
possible
provision
for
her
comfort
and
happiness
the
most
recent
books
were
sent
to
her
and
the
latest
music
found
its
way
into
the
wilderness
for
her
amusement
himself
a
man
ralph
darrell
devoted
his
abundant
leisure
to
her
instruction
and
to
the
study
of
her
tastes
only
two
of
the
girl
expressed
wishes
were
left
ungratified
and
both
of
these
he
had
promised
to
grant
when
she
should
be
eighteen
years
of
age
one
of
them
was
that
they
might
return
to
the
home
of
her
childhood
to
this
her
father
unvarying
answer
was
that
business
and
a
regard
for
her
future
welfare
compelled
him
to
remain
where
they
were
until
the
expiration
of
a
certain
time
when
it
should
be
elapsed
he
promised
that
she
should
lead
him
to
any
part
of
the
world
she
chose
cheered
by
this
promise
she
planned
many
an
imaginary
journey
to
foreign
lands
and
many
a
long
hour
did
mary
and
her
father
beguile
in
arranging
the
details
of
these
delightful
wanderings
her
other
wish
was
for
a
companion
of
her
own
age
but
this
was
so
decidedly
denied
that
she
knew
it
would
be
useless
to
express
it
again
after
the
first
time
it
would
mean
ruin
absolute
ruin
and
beggary
for
us
both
said
darrell
if
i
were
to
allow
a
single
stranger
young
or
old
of
even
ordinary
intelligence
to
visit
this
place
from
the
time
you
are
eighteen
years
of
age
you
shall
have
plenty
of
friends
of
your
own
choosing
but
until
that
date
dear
you
must
be
content
with
only
the
society
of
your
old
dad
so
mary
darrell
studied
sang
read
rode
and
thought
the
fanciful
thoughts
of
girlhood
alone
but
always
with
impatient
longings
for
the
coming
of
the
magic
hour
that
should
set
her
free
and
yet
she
was
not
wholly
alone
for
her
father
would
at
any
time
neglect
everything
else
to
give
her
pleasure
while
she
also
had
both
sandy
her
and
fuzz
her
pony
for
devoted
companions
she
was
allowed
to
ride
when
and
where
she
pleased
with
only
these
attendants
on
two
conditions
one
was
that
she
should
never
visit
nor
even
go
near
a
human
residence
and
the
other
that
when
on
such
excursions
she
should
for
greater
safety
dress
as
a
boy
when
she
was
thus
costumed
her
father
was
very
apt
to
call
her
by
her
middle
name
which
was
heaton
and
so
it
was
generally
supposed
by
the
few
miners
who
caught
glimpses
of
her
that
the
old
man
had
two
children
a
girl
and
a
boy
who
was
not
only
younger
than
she
but
devoted
to
horseback
riding
only
one
duty
devolved
upon
the
girl
thus
strangely
reared
and
that
was
the
keeping
watch
for
certain
vessels
that
came
in
from
the
great
lake
and
sailed
away
again
at
regular
intervals
so
mary
darrell
was
out
riding
on
the
evening
that
witnessed
the
capture
of
richard
peveril
by
his
bitterest
enemies
and
as
twilight
deepened
into
dusk
she
was
urging
her
way
homeward
with
all
speed
in
the
meantime
the
three
rascal
who
had
come
so
unexpectedly
upon
him
whom
they
sought
and
had
so
easily
effected
his
capture
led
peveril
directly
away
from
the
trail
he
had
been
following
to
a
place
in
the
woods
known
only
to
rothsky
close
to
where
they
finally
halted
and
began
preparations
for
the
punishment
of
the
prisoner
who
was
also
expected
to
afford
them
infinite
amusement
by
his
sufferings
yawned
a
great
black
hole
it
was
of
unknown
depth
and
was
nearly
concealed
by
a
tangle
of
vines
and
bushes
rothsky
had
stumbled
upon
it
by
accident
only
a
few
days
before
and
now
conceived
that
it
would
be
a
good
place
in
which
to
dispose
of
a
body
in
case
they
should
happen
to
have
one
on
their
hands
trusting
to
the
wildness
of
their
surroundings
and
the
absence
of
human
beings
from
that
region
to
shield
them
from
observation
they
ventured
to
build
a
fire
by
the
light
of
which
they
proposed
to
carry
out
their
devilish
plans
besides
binding
peveril
arms
they
had
on
reaching
this
place
taken
the
further
precaution
of
tying
his
ankles
so
that
he
now
lay
on
the
ground
utterly
helpless
a
prey
to
bitter
thoughts
but
nerving
himself
to
bear
bravely
whatever
torture
might
await
him
all
at
once
the
deep
baying
of
a
hound
and
a
crash
of
galloping
hoofs
coming
directly
towards
the
sounded
through
the
wood
with
a
fierce
imprecation
rothsky
gave
a
hasty
order
at
which
all
three
men
sprang
to
where
peveril
was
lying
in
deepest
shadow
hurriedly
picking
him
up
they
carried
him
a
short
distance
gave
a
mighty
swing
and
flung
him
from
them
there
was
a
crash
of
parted
bushes
and
rending
vines
a
stifled
cry
and
all
was
still
a
minute
later
when
a
boyish
figure
on
horseback
swept
past
the
fire
the
three
men
seated
by
it
only
aroused
a
fleeting
curiosity
in
mary
darrell
mind
as
to
what
they
could
be
doing
in
such
a
place
at
such
a
time
chapter
xvi
lost
in
a
prehistoric
mine
after
the
disappearance
of
the
young
rider
whose
coming
had
so
materially
changed
the
plan
of
rothsky
and
his
associate
scoundrels
they
gazed
at
each
other
for
a
full
minute
in
sullen
silence
in
the
minds
of
two
of
them
the
anger
of
their
disappointment
was
mingled
with
a
cowardly
terror
at
the
awful
deed
they
had
committed
and
they
began
fiercely
to
denounce
their
leader
for
having
implicated
them
in
it
rothsky
answered
with
equal
bitterness
that
he
was
no
more
to
blame
than
they
and
the
quarrel
grew
so
furious
that
for
a
time
it
seemed
as
though
only
the
shedding
of
blood
could
settle
it
at
length
they
were
quieted
by
a
realizing
sense
of
the
common
danger
that
might
only
be
averted
by
mutual
support
so
they
finally
swore
with
strange
oaths
never
to
betray
each
other
or
breathe
a
word
to
a
living
soul
of
what
had
just
taken
place
of
course
they
did
not
for
a
moment
anticipate
that
their
crime
would
ever
come
to
light
though
each
was
secretly
determined
that
if
it
did
he
would
promptly
secure
his
own
safety
by
denouncing
his
comrades
with
the
patching
up
of
this
truce
and
the
forming
of
their
worthless
compact
the
three
wretches
prepared
to
depart
from
the
scene
of
their
villany
first
however
they
advanced
cautiously
as
close
as
they
dared
to
the
edge
of
the
pit
into
which
they
had
flung
their
victim
and
peering
into
its
blackness
listened
fearfully
no
sound
broke
the
awful
silence
and
of
a
sudden
the
three
men
moved
by
a
common
impulse
turned
and
fled
through
the
darkness
stumbling
and
falling
clutched
at
by
invisible
fingers
as
they
ran
and
uttering
inarticulate
cries
of
terror
at
that
same
moment
their
victim
was
lying
on
a
ledge
of
rock
deep
down
in
the
ground
beneath
them
still
alive
but
numbed
almost
into
unconsciousness
by
the
hopeless
horror
of
his
situation
in
the
first
agony
of
falling
he
had
instinctively
exerted
a
strength
of
which
he
would
have
been
incapable
under
other
circumstances
and
burst
asunder
the
bonds
confining
his
arms
he
believed
that
in
a
moment
he
would
be
dashed
into
eternity
and
yet
a
medley
of
incongruous
and
commonplace
thoughts
darted
through
his
mind
with
inconceivable
rapidity
innumerable
scenes
of
his
past
life
glanced
before
him
but
more
distinct
than
any
sharp
and
clear
as
though
revealed
by
a
flash
of
lightning
shone
the
wonderful
eyes
that
had
appeared
to
him
from
the
cliffs
overlooking
the
great
lake
and
strangest
of
all
the
face
seemed
to
smile
at
him
with
a
promise
of
hope
in
another
instant
all
the
pictures
were
blotted
out
and
his
whole
world
was
gulfed
by
a
rush
of
water
in
which
he
sank
to
fathomless
depths
after
an
endless
space
of
time
he
began
slowly
to
rise
until
at
length
to
his
infinite
amazement
he
found
himself
still
alive
and
gasping
for
a
breath
of
the
blessed
air
into
which
he
had
once
more
emerged
although
his
ankles
were
still
bound
his
arms
were
free
and
with
the
instinct
of
strong
within
him
he
began
awkwardly
and
feebly
to
swim
dazed
fettered
and
weighted
by
clothing
as
he
was
his
utmost
efforts
would
not
have
carried
him
more
than
a
few
feet
and
then
he
must
have
sunk
forever
in
that
black
flood
but
the
strength
given
him
was
sufficient
and
ere
it
was
exhausted
his
hands
struck
a
shelf
of
rock
upon
which
he
finally
managed
to
drag
himself
on
the
flinty
platform
that
he
thus
gained
he
lay
weakly
motionless
chilled
to
the
bone
dimly
conscious
that
he
had
for
a
time
been
granted
a
respite
from
death
but
without
a
hope
that
it
would
be
much
longer
extended
after
a
while
the
sense
that
he
still
lived
became
stronger
and
with
it
grew
the
desire
for
life
animated
by
it
he
sat
up
and
made
an
effort
to
loosen
the
cord
that
still
bound
his
ankles
it
was
tightly
knotted
and
the
knot
was
so
hardened
with
the
water
that
for
a
long
time
his
trembling
fingers
could
make
no
impression
on
it
still
he
persevered
and
his
exertions
infused
him
with
a
slight
warmth
finally
the
knot
yielded
and
his
limbs
were
free
though
so
numbed
that
it
was
several
minutes
before
he
could
stand
up
knowing
nothing
of
his
surroundings
he
dared
not
move
more
than
a
step
or
two
in
any
direction
for
fear
of
again
plunging
into
that
deadly
water
nor
could
he
with
outstretched
arms
touch
a
wall
on
any
side
oh
for
a
light
he
groaned
that
i
might
at
least
see
what
my
tomb
looks
like
then
he
remembered
that
he
actually
did
possess
both
matches
and
a
candle
it
having
been
impressed
upon
him
by
old
mark
trefethen
that
a
miner
should
never
be
without
those
necessities
so
he
had
always
carried
them
in
a
pocket
of
his
canvas
but
were
they
not
rendered
useless
by
the
double
wetting
he
had
received
that
day
with
trembling
eagerness
he
drew
forth
the
silver
that
tom
trefethen
had
insisted
on
presenting
to
him
in
token
of
his
gratitude
it
had
been
called
would
it
prove
so
in
this
time
of
his
greatest
need
a
match
was
withdrawn
and
he
struck
it
against
a
roughened
side
of
the
safe
there
was
a
splutter
of
sparks
but
no
flame
that
however
was
more
than
he
had
dared
hope
for
and
sitting
down
that
he
might
not
run
the
chance
of
dropping
his
precious
box
he
rubbed
it
briskly
in
his
hands
until
it
was
thoroughly
dry
before
making
another
attempt
this
time
there
was
no
result
the
head
of
the
match
having
evidently
flown
off
with
breathless
anxiety
he
tried
a
third
and
was
thrilled
with
joy
by
having
it
burst
into
flame
tom
trefethen
gift
had
redeemed
its
promise
by
the
fitful
flare
of
that
match
whose
cheery
gleam
filled
him
with
a
new
hope
peveril
saw
that
he
was
sitting
on
the
rocky
floor
of
a
cave
or
chamber
that
extended
back
beyond
his
narrow
circle
of
light
on
the
other
side
and
but
a
few
inches
below
him
was
outspread
a
gleaming
surface
of
water
smooth
as
a
mirror
and
black
as
ink
these
things
he
saw
and
then
his
match
burned
out
the
darkness
that
followed
was
so
absolute
as
to
be
suffocating
but
before
striking
another
of
the
priceless
he
drew
forth
the
candle
that
had
lain
quietly
in
his
pocket
for
several
weeks
awaiting
just
such
an
emergency
as
the
present
after
many
reluctant
sputterings
it
too
yielded
to
his
efforts
and
finally
burned
with
a
steady
flame
with
it
he
was
enabled
to
make
a
much
more
careful
and
extended
survey
of
his
surroundings
to
his
great
delight
he
discovered
lodged
here
and
there
on
the
rocks
about
him
a
considerable
quantity
of
dry
wood
in
small
pieces
whittling
some
shavings
from
one
of
these
he
soon
had
a
brisk
blaze
that
not
only
drove
the
black
shadows
to
a
respectful
distance
but
imparted
a
delicious
warmth
to
his
chilled
body
i
live
to
get
out
of
this
place
yet
and
confront
the
wretches
who
tried
to
murder
me
see
if
i
do
he
cried
filled
with
a
new
courage
inspired
by
the
magic
of
light
and
warmth
they
probably
think
me
safely
dead
long
ere
this
but
they
find
out
that
i
am
very
much
alive
and
i
know
them
when
i
see
them
again
too
what
could
have
been
their
object
and
what
can
they
have
against
me
i
wonder
if
the
old
fellow
who
claimed
the
logs
could
have
set
them
on
to
me
i
hate
to
believe
it
but
the
whole
business
looks
awfully
suspicious
there
a
deep
game
going
on
somewhere
but
i
may
live
to
fathom
it
yet
what
made
them
start
up
in
such
a
hurry
and
fling
me
down
this
hole
i
remember
they
were
scared
by
the
barking
of
a
dog
and
the
approach
of
some
one
on
horseback
whoever
that
chap
was
i
owe
him
a
debt
of
gratitude
if
ever
i
get
out
of
here
and
if
i
do
well
perhaps
he
did
me
a
good
turn
anyhow
for
they
would
probably
have
killed
me
in
the
end
hello
i
had
forgotten
these
hardtack
mechanically
thrusting
his
hands
into
the
pockets
of
his
coat
during
this
soliloquy
peveril
found
the
hard
biscuit
that
he
had
slipped
into
them
on
leaving
camp
now
though
these
were
soggy
with
water
they
were
still
in
a
condition
to
be
handled
and
carefully
withdrawing
them
he
ate
one
hungrily
but
laid
the
other
near
the
fire
to
dry
then
he
removed
his
clothing
wrung
what
water
he
could
from
each
article
rubbed
his
body
into
a
glow
and
again
sat
beside
his
fire
for
a
further
consideration
of
his
strange
situation
as
he
could
arrive
at
no
conclusion
regarding
an
attempt
to
escape
until
the
coming
of
daylight
which
he
hoped
would
reach
him
with
sufficient
clearness
to
disclose
the
nature
of
his
prison
his
thoughts
finally
drifted
to
other
matters
he
recalled
his
lost
letter
and
wondered
if
rose
would
grow
very
impatient
at
his
long
delay
in
answering
it
if
she
does
she
must
he
remarked
philosophically
for
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
hurry
the
mails
just
now
how
distressed
the
dear
girl
would
be
though
if
she
could
see
me
at
this
minute
that
is
if
she
did
find
it
a
situation
for
laughter
and
by
jove
i
believe
she
would
for
she
laughs
at
most
everything
i
only
hope
we
will
have
the
chance
to
laugh
over
it
together
some
time
in
some
way
thoughts
of
rose
led
to
a
recollection
of
that
other
girl
whom
he
had
only
seen
for
an
instant
and
when
a
little
later
in
spite
of
his
desperate
situation
he
actually
fell
asleep
on
his
bed
of
cold
flint
it
was
the
face
of
the
unknown
that
again
haunted
his
dreams
chapter
xvii
underground
wanderings
when
peveril
next
awoke
he
was
racked
with
pain
and
so
stiff
in
every
joint
that
an
attempt
to
move
caused
him
to
groan
aloud
a
faint
light
dimly
revealed
his
surroundings
but
these
were
so
strange
and
weird
that
for
several
minutes
he
could
not
imagine
where
he
was
nor
what
had
happened
slowly
the
truth
dawned
upon
him
and
one
by
one
the
awful
incidents
of
the
past
night
began
to
shape
themselves
in
his
mind
i
have
been
murdered
and
drowned
he
said
to
himself
now
i
am
entombed
alive
beyond
reach
of
hope
or
human
knowledge
never
again
shall
i
see
the
sunlight
never
revisit
the
surface
of
the
earth
never
look
upon
my
fellows
nor
hear
the
voice
of
man
i
may
live
for
several
days
but
i
must
live
them
alone
alone
must
i
bear
my
sufferings
and
finally
i
must
die
alone
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
such
a
fate
is
there
no
escape
from
it
i
shall
go
mad
and
i
hope
i
may
better
oblivion
than
a
knowledge
of
such
agony
as
is
in
store
for
me
and
yet
why
should
i
lose
faith
in
the
power
that
has
thus
far
miraculously
preserved
me
i
am
alive
and
in
possession
of
all
my
faculties
i
shall
not
suffer
from
thirst
i
even
have
a
certain
amount
of
food
together
with
the
means
for
procuring
fire
i
am
not
left
in
utter
darkness
and
above
all
i
have
not
yet
proved
by
a
single
trial
that
escape
is
impossible
how
much
better
off
i
am
in
every
respect
than
thousands
of
others
who
finding
themselves
in
desperate
straits
have
yet
had
the
strength
and
courage
to
work
out
their
own
salvation
what
an
ingrate
i
have
been
what
a
coward
but
with
god
help
i
will
no
longer
be
either
having
thus
brought
himself
to
a
happier
and
more
courageous
frame
of
mind
peveril
stiffly
gained
his
feet
moved
his
limbs
and
rubbed
them
until
a
certain
degree
of
suppleness
was
restored
he
was
about
to
build
a
fire
but
refrained
from
so
doing
upon
reflection
that
his
stock
of
fuel
must
be
limited
and
that
a
fire
might
be
of
infinitely
greater
value
at
some
other
time
now
the
prisoner
began
a
careful
survey
of
his
surroundings
by
the
feeble
light
finding
its
way
down
the
shaft
into
which
he
had
been
flung
as
it
did
not
materially
increase
he
concluded
that
full
day
had
already
reached
the
upper
world
it
was
also
brightest
in
the
middle
of
the
black
pool
which
showed
that
the
opening
through
which
it
came
must
be
directly
above
that
point
and
that
the
shaft
must
be
perpendicular
peveril
called
the
hole
a
shaft
because
while
he
could
neither
see
to
the
top
nor
clearly
make
out
the
outlines
of
the
portions
nearest
at
hand
it
still
impressed
him
as
being
of
artificial
construction
while
the
opening
at
one
side
in
which
he
stood
also
seemed
very
much
like
a
drift
or
gallery
hewn
from
the
solid
rock
by
human
hands
the
impossibility
of
scaling
the
sheer
smooth
walls
of
the
shaft
was
evident
at
a
single
glance
and
peveril
turned
from
it
with
a
heavy
heart
at
the
same
moment
his
attention
was
attracted
by
a
sharp
squeaking
and
to
his
dismay
he
made
out
a
confused
mass
of
something
in
active
motion
about
the
precious
biscuit
that
he
had
left
beside
his
fireplace
with
a
loud
cry
he
sprang
in
that
direction
only
to
stumble
and
fall
over
a
small
pile
of
what
he
took
to
be
rocks
that
lay
in
his
path
without
waiting
to
regain
his
feet
he
flung
several
of
these
at
the
animals
that
had
discovered
and
were
devouring
his
hardtack
a
louder
squeak
than
before
showed
that
at
least
one
of
his
missiles
had
taken
effect
and
then
there
was
a
scampering
away
of
tiny
feet
when
he
reached
the
scene
of
destruction
his
only
biscuit
was
half
eaten
while
beside
it
lay
a
huge
rat
that
had
been
killed
by
one
of
his
shots
with
plenty
of
rats
and
plenty
of
rocks
i
need
not
starve
at
any
rate
he
remarked
grimly
the
idea
of
eating
rats
is
horrid
of
course
but
i
do
know
why
it
should
be
certainly
many
persons
have
eaten
them
and
in
an
emergency
i
do
know
why
i
should
be
any
more
squeamish
than
others
what
heavy
rocks
those
were
though
and
what
sharp
edges
they
had
i
expect
it
will
be
a
good
idea
to
collect
a
few
and
have
them
ready
for
my
next
with
this
peveril
returned
to
the
pile
over
which
he
had
stumbled
and
to
his
amazement
found
it
to
be
composed
of
hammers
and
hatchets
chisels
knives
and
other
tools
that
he
was
unable
to
name
all
of
quaint
shape
and
all
made
of
tempered
copper
in
an
instant
the
nature
of
his
prison
became
clear
he
was
in
a
prehistoric
opened
and
worked
thousands
of
years
ago
by
a
people
so
ancient
that
even
tradition
has
nought
to
say
concerning
them
the
knowledge
thus
thrust
upon
him
filled
the
young
man
with
awe
and
he
glanced
nervously
about
him
as
though
expecting
to
see
the
ghosts
of
delvers
advancing
from
the
inner
gloom
the
thought
that
he
was
probably
the
first
human
being
to
set
foot
on
that
rocky
platform
since
the
prehistoric
workmen
had
flung
down
their
tools
on
it
for
the
last
time
was
overpowering
at
the
same
time
if
this
were
indeed
a
mine
it
must
also
be
a
tomb
for
it
was
not
likely
to
have
any
exit
save
the
unscalable
shaft
glimmering
hopelessly
above
him
here
then
was
the
end
of
all
his
hopes
for
of
what
use
were
strength
and
courage
in
a
place
where
neither
could
be
made
available
but
hold
where
had
the
rats
come
from
certainly
not
from
the
water
nor
was
it
probable
that
they
had
come
down
the
shaft
for
its
rocky
sides
appeared
as
straight
and
smooth
as
those
of
a
well
why
should
they
have
come
at
all
to
a
place
that
could
not
contain
a
crumb
of
food
except
the
scanty
supply
that
he
had
brought
if
that
alone
had
attracted
them
why
had
they
not
found
it
hours
before
while
he
was
asleep
might
it
not
be
possible
that
they
had
come
from
a
distance
in
search
of
water
after
a
night
of
feasting
elsewhere
they
had
at
any
rate
run
back
into
the
gallery
and
by
following
the
lead
thus
presented
he
might
find
some
place
of
exit
from
that
terrible
subterranean
prison
even
if
it
were
only
a
he
might
be
able
to
enlarge
it
now
that
he
had
tools
with
which
to
work
at
this
moment
how
he
blessed
the
dear
old
friend
at
whose
insistence
he
had
provided
himself
with
the
matches
and
candle
that
now
rendered
it
possible
for
him
to
explore
the
dark
depths
of
that
prehistoric
drift
before
starting
on
the
trip
that
he
was
now
determined
to
make
he
ate
the
portion
of
biscuit
left
by
the
rats
he
also
so
far
overcame
his
repugnance
as
to
skin
and
clean
the
dead
rat
which
he
placed
on
a
ledge
of
rock
for
future
use
in
case
he
should
be
driven
to
it
then
he
lighted
his
candle
and
set
forth
for
a
considerable
distance
the
gallery
was
open
and
fairly
spacious
while
everywhere
the
young
explorer
found
scattered
on
its
floor
the
ancient
and
quaintly
shaped
tools
that
told
of
the
great
number
of
workmen
employed
in
its
excavation
after
a
while
his
way
began
to
be
encumbered
by
piles
of
loose
rock
that
seemed
to
have
been
collected
for
the
purpose
of
removal
now
his
way
grew
narrower
and
rougher
until
in
several
places
it
was
nearly
blocked
by
masses
of
material
that
had
fallen
from
the
roof
or
caved
in
from
the
sides
over
some
of
these
he
was
forced
to
creep
on
hands
and
knees
flattening
himself
into
the
smallest
possible
compass
at
length
the
gallery
came
to
an
end
though
from
it
a
small
winze
or
passage
barely
wide
enough
to
crawl
through
led
upward
at
a
sharp
angle
at
the
bottom
of
this
peveril
hesitated
his
precious
candle
was
half
burned
out
and
would
not
much
more
than
serve
to
carry
him
back
to
the
place
from
which
he
had
started
besides
this
the
passage
before
him
was
so
small
that
a
person
entering
it
could
by
no
possibility
turn
around
if
he
should
desire
to
retrace
his
course
it
was
even
doubtful
if
he
could
back
out
after
having
penetrated
a
short
distance
into
the
winze
i
do
know
why
i
should
care
though
said
peveril
bitterly
for
even
if
i
should
get
stuck
in
there
it
would
only
be
exchanging
a
tomb
for
a
grave
at
the
same
time
one
does
like
to
have
room
even
to
die
in
and
i
do
believe
the
risk
is
worth
taking
there
the
slightest
chance
of
a
hole
like
that
leading
anywhere
and
so
long
as
i
can
draw
a
breath
at
all
i
am
going
to
draw
it
in
the
open
so
with
the
last
spark
of
hope
extinguished
and
with
a
heart
like
lead
the
poor
fellow
turned
to
retrace
his
steps
to
the
place
in
which
he
proposed
to
spend
his
few
remaining
hours
of
life
and
then
to
yield
it
up
as
bravely
as
might
be
as
he
did
so
a
little
gusty
draught
of
air
blew
the
flame
from
his
candle
and
plunged
him
into
absolute
darkness
illustration
peveril
sat
beside
the
fire
in
forlorn
meditation
peveril
was
so
startled
by
this
occurrence
that
for
some
time
he
plunged
blindly
with
outstretched
hands
back
over
the
way
he
had
come
forgetting
in
his
bewilderment
that
he
still
had
matches
with
which
to
relight
his
candle
ere
this
was
suggested
to
him
he
had
retraced
about
half
the
distance
guided
solely
by
the
sense
of
feeling
though
not
without
innumerable
bruises
and
abrasions
when
he
at
length
reached
the
end
of
the
gallery
and
stood
once
more
beside
the
black
pool
into
which
he
had
been
flung
what
little
of
daylight
found
its
way
into
those
dim
depths
was
rapidly
fading
it
only
served
while
he
gathered
every
stick
of
drift
that
some
former
high
stage
of
water
had
deposited
on
the
rocky
platform
and
then
another
night
of
almost
arctic
length
was
begun
to
escape
the
awful
gloom
peveril
lighted
a
fire
and
sat
beside
it
in
forlorn
meditation
carefully
feeding
it
one
stick
at
a
time
and
longing
for
some
sound
to
break
the
oppressive
silence
finally
faint
with
hunger
he
recalled
the
bit
of
game
that
he
had
stored
away
ready
for
cooking
fetching
this
he
quickly
had
it
spitted
on
a
sliver
of
wood
and
broiling
with
appetizing
odor
over
a
tiny
bed
of
coals
it
smelled
so
good
as
it
sizzled
and
browned
that
all
his
repugnance
vanished
and
he
was
only
impatient
for
it
to
be
cooked
the
moment
it
was
so
he
began
to
devour
it
ravenously
regretting
at
the
same
time
that
he
had
not
half
a
dozen
rats
to
eat
instead
of
one
he
felt
better
after
his
meal
and
a
new
courage
crept
into
his
heavy
heart
as
he
again
sat
in
meditation
beside
his
flickering
blaze
why
he
should
feel
more
hopeful
he
could
not
imagine
for
no
glimmer
of
a
plan
for
escape
had
presented
itself
it
was
not
until
he
had
once
more
stretched
himself
on
his
flinty
bed
with
a
block
of
wood
for
a
pillow
and
was
trying
to
forget
his
wretchedness
in
sleep
that
he
knew
then
he
sprang
up
with
a
shout
what
an
idiot
i
am
what
an
absolute
idiot
where
did
the
draught
that
blew
out
my
light
come
from
from
up
that
sloping
passage
of
course
and
a
draught
can
only
be
caused
by
an
opening
of
some
kind
to
the
outer
air
if
i
can
only
find
it
i
believe
i
shall
also
find
a
way
out
of
here
so
old
man
cheer
up
and
never
say
die
you
live
to
stand
on
top
of
the
world
again

chapter
xviii
from
one
trap
into
another
the
light
of
another
day
was
dimly
penetrating
those
underground
depths
before
our
prisoner
was
prepared
to
make
his
last
effort
for
liberty
for
all
the
aid
he
would
receive
from
the
pitiful
amount
allotted
to
him
he
might
as
well
have
started
hours
earlier
but
while
he
longed
to
make
the
trial
he
also
dreaded
it
the
thought
of
that
passage
through
which
he
would
be
obliged
to
force
his
way
without
a
chance
of
retreat
was
so
terrible
that
he
shrank
from
it
as
we
all
shrink
from
anything
dangerous
or
painful
then
too
if
he
should
escape
he
would
want
daylight
by
which
to
guide
his
future
movements
so
after
tossing
for
hours
on
his
hard
bed
and
considering
every
aspect
of
his
situation
he
finally
fell
into
a
troubled
sleep
that
lasted
until
morning
for
breakfast
he
had
only
water
but
of
this
he
drank
as
much
as
he
could
for
he
knew
not
when
he
would
find
another
supply
then
he
selected
such
of
the
copper
tools
as
he
thought
might
prove
useful
into
one
of
them
which
was
a
sort
of
a
pick
he
fitted
a
rude
wooden
handle
while
the
others
which
had
cutting
edges
and
were
in
the
nature
of
knives
he
thrust
into
his
pockets
having
thus
completed
his
simple
preparations
he
took
a
long
look
that
he
well
knew
might
be
his
last
on
the
daylight
that
was
now
so
doubly
precious
and
then
resolutely
faced
the
inner
gloom
of
the
ancient
mine
determined
to
save
his
candle
for
use
in
the
unknown
winze
he
slowly
groped
his
way
through
utter
darkness
and
finally
reached
what
he
believed
to
be
the
end
of
the
drift
now
he
lighted
his
candle
and
for
a
moment
his
unaccustomed
eyes
ached
from
the
glare
of
its
flame
he
was
as
he
had
thought
at
the
lower
opening
of
the
narrow
passage
and
as
he
noted
its
steep
upward
slope
he
was
agitated
by
conflicting
hopes
and
fears
it
might
lead
to
liberty
but
there
was
an
equal
chance
that
in
it
he
should
miserably
perish
at
the
very
outset
he
was
confronted
by
a
condition
that
was
not
only
disappointing
but
exerted
a
most
depressing
influence
there
was
no
draught
such
as
he
had
believed
would
issue
from
the
winze
in
vain
did
he
hold
up
a
wetted
finger
in
vain
watch
for
the
slightest
flicker
in
the
flame
of
his
candle
the
air
was
as
stagnant
as
that
of
a
dungeon
and
yet
there
certainly
had
been
a
decided
current
at
that
very
place
only
a
few
hours
before
puzzled
and
disheartened
he
was
still
determined
to
press
forward
and
stooping
low
he
entered
the
passage
it
almost
immediately
became
so
contracted
that
he
was
compelled
to
creep
on
hands
and
knees
by
which
method
he
slowly
and
painfully
overcame
foot
after
foot
of
the
ascent
a
little
later
he
was
forcing
his
way
with
infinite
labor
an
inch
at
a
time
through
a
space
so
narrow
that
he
was
squeezed
almost
to
breathlessness
he
was
also
bathed
in
perspiration
and
was
obliged
to
recruit
his
strength
by
frequent
halts
at
length
his
candle
which
had
burned
low
was
about
to
expire
with
despairing
eyes
he
watched
its
last
flickering
flame
feeling
only
the
terror
of
impending
darkness
and
heedless
of
the
fact
that
it
was
burning
his
hand
with
the
quenching
of
its
final
spark
he
resigned
himself
to
his
fate
he
had
fought
his
best
but
the
odds
against
him
were
too
heavy
and
now
his
strength
was
exhausted
closing
his
eyes
and
resting
his
head
wearily
on
his
folded
arms
he
prepared
for
the
oblivion
that
he
prayed
might
come
speedily
lying
thus
and
careless
of
the
passage
of
time
he
was
visited
by
pleasant
dreams
in
which
were
mingled
happy
voices
laughter
and
singing
he
rested
on
a
couch
of
roses
and
cool
breezes
fanned
his
fevered
brow
he
was
free
as
air
itself
and
surrounded
by
illimitable
space
all
at
once
he
became
conscious
that
he
was
not
dreaming
but
was
wide
awake
and
staring
with
incredulous
eyes
at
a
glimmer
of
light
so
wellnigh
imperceptible
that
only
by
passing
a
hand
before
his
face
and
so
shutting
it
out
for
an
instant
could
he
be
certain
of
its
existence
at
the
same
time
an
unmistakable
draught
of
air
was
finding
its
way
to
him
and
a
voice
as
of
an
angel
came
to
his
ears
faintly
but
distinctly
with
the
snatch
of
a
gay
song
with
hot
blood
surging
to
his
brain
the
poor
fellow
tried
to
call
out
but
the
words
died
in
his
parched
throat
and
he
could
only
emit
a
husky
whisper
then
he
struggled
forward
and
found
himself
in
a
larger
space
that
widened
rapidly
until
he
was
able
to
sit
up
and
move
his
arms
with
freedom
he
had
reached
the
end
of
the
passage
for
above
his
head
he
could
feel
only
a
smooth
surface
of
rock
the
singing
had
ceased
the
ray
of
light
had
faded
into
darkness
and
the
draught
of
air
was
no
longer
felt
but
peveril
had
noted
the
aperture
by
which
it
had
come
and
could
now
thrust
his
hand
through
this
into
a
vacant
space
beyond
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
rock
above
his
head
was
but
a
slab
of
no
great
thickness
and
he
tried
to
lift
it
for
some
minutes
he
could
not
succeed
but
finally
he
secured
a
purchase
got
his
shoulders
directly
beneath
it
and
with
a
mighty
upward
heave
moved
it
slightly
from
the
bed
in
which
it
had
lain
for
centuries
with
another
powerful
effort
it
was
lifted
the
fraction
of
an
inch
and
though
it
immediately
settled
back
in
place
the
prisoner
knew
that
the
time
of
his
deliverance
had
come
he
could
not
raise
the
great
slab
bodily
but
with
wedges
he
could
hold
the
gain
of
each
upward
lift
his
first
aids
of
this
kind
were
the
copper
knives
that
he
had
brought
with
him
then
by
a
dim
light
that
came
through
the
crevice
thus
opened
he
used
his
pick
to
break
off
fragments
of
rock
which
were
slipped
under
the
slab
it
was
thus
raised
and
supported
an
inch
at
a
time
until
at
length
an
opening
nearly
two
feet
in
width
was
presented
the
moment
this
was
effected
peveril
drew
himself
through
it
and
with
a
great
sigh
of
thankfulness
for
his
marvellous
escape
lay
for
some
minutes
recovering
breath
after
his
tremendous
exertions
and
studying
his
new
surroundings
although
the
small
amount
of
light
greeting
his
eyes
as
he
lifted
the
rock
had
shown
him
that
he
was
not
to
emerge
into
the
open
air
he
could
not
help
a
feeling
of
disappointment
at
finding
himself
still
underground
to
be
sure
he
was
in
a
spacious
chamber
or
cavern
he
could
not
yet
tell
which
illumined
by
a
faintly
diffused
light
that
gave
promise
of
some
connection
with
the
outer
world
but
he
feared
this
might
prove
to
be
another
unscalable
shaft
in
which
case
he
would
be
no
better
off
than
before
in
fact
he
might
find
himself
worse
off
for
he
was
desperately
thirsty
and
could
see
no
sign
of
water
it
would
be
pretty
hard
lines
if
i
should
be
compelled
to
return
to
my
old
well
for
a
drink
he
said
to
himself
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
breath
peveril
rose
to
his
feet
and
began
to
walk
slowly
towards
that
part
of
the
cavern
where
the
light
seemed
brightest
as
he
went
he
looked
eagerly
on
all
sides
for
some
trace
of
the
singer
whose
voice
had
inspired
him
with
a
new
hope
at
the
moment
of
his
blackest
despair
but
no
person
was
to
be
seen
or
heard
at
the
same
time
he
found
abundant
proof
that
human
beings
had
recently
visited
that
place
and
would
doubtless
soon
do
so
again
this
was
in
the
shape
of
boxes
bales
and
casks
piled
against
the
walls
on
both
sides
of
the
passage
for
a
moment
peveril
was
greatly
puzzled
by
these
then
as
he
recalled
joe
pintaud
conversation
regarding
smugglers
he
concluded
that
he
had
stumbled
across
a
depot
of
goods
belonging
to
those
of
the
great
lake
in
which
case
he
said
to
himself
i
shall
surely
be
out
of
here
within
a
few
minutes
for
an
entrance
for
smugglers
must
mean
an
exit
for
prisoners
this
was
a
sound
theory
but
like
a
great
many
other
theories
one
that
proved
faulty
upon
practical
application
as
our
young
friend
discovered
a
few
minutes
later
directly
beyond
the
packages
of
goods
he
came
upon
a
small
derrick
set
firmly
into
the
solid
rock
at
both
top
and
bottom
it
had
a
substantial
attachment
and
was
swung
inward
at
this
point
also
a
heavy
tarpaulin
reaching
from
floor
to
ceiling
was
hung
completely
across
the
cavern
cautiously
raising
one
corner
of
this
peveril
was
blinded
by
such
a
flood
of
light
that
for
a
moment
he
was
completely
dazzled
as
his
vision
was
gradually
restored
he
found
himself
on
the
brink
of
a
precipice
and
gazing
out
over
a
boundless
expanse
of
water
in
fact
over
the
great
lake
itself
a
narrow
ledge
projected
a
little
beyond
the
curtain
that
he
had
lifted
and
as
he
hesitatingly
stepped
out
upon
it
he
also
instinctively
grasped
a
small
cedar
that
grew
from
it
to
steady
himself
while
he
looked
down
the
descent
was
sheer
for
twenty
feet
and
so
smooth
as
not
to
afford
a
single
foothold
along
its
entire
face
from
the
rippling
water
at
its
base
rose
a
jagged
ledge
of
black
rocks
which
peveril
recognized
the
moment
his
eyes
fell
upon
them
of
all
mysteries
this
is
the
most
inexplicable
he
cried
and
yet
it
surely
is
the
very
place
as
he
spoke
he
turned
to
look
at
the
curtain
which
he
had
let
fall
behind
him
and
very
nearly
tumbled
from
the
ledge
in
amazement
at
what
he
saw
instead
of
the
sheet
of
dingy
canvas
that
he
expected
he
was
confronted
by
a
sheer
wall
of
cliff
stained
the
same
rusty
red
as
that
extending
for
miles
on
either
side
and
apparently
not
differing
from
it
in
any
particular
he
was
compelled
to
reach
out
his
hand
and
touch
it
before
he
could
dispel
the
illusion
and
convince
himself
that
only
a
sheet
of
painted
canvas
separated
him
from
the
cavern
he
had
just
left
it
is
one
of
the
very
cleverest
things
in
the
way
of
a
i
ever
heard
of
he
said
half
aloud
and
now
i
understand
the
disappearance
of
that
girl
but
where
on
earth
did
she
come
from
how
did
she
get
here
and
where
did
she
go
to
could
it
have
been
she
whom
i
heard
singing
a
little
while
ago
if
so
where
is
she
now
not
in
the
cavern
that
i
swear
to
peveril
might
have
speculated
at
much
greater
length
concerning
this
mystery
had
not
the
sight
of
water
that
he
could
not
reach
so
aggravated
his
thirst
that
for
the
moment
he
could
think
of
little
else
all
at
once
he
hit
upon
a
plan
and
two
minutes
later
had
drawn
aside
the
curtain
swung
out
the
little
derrick
and
was
letting
himself
down
towards
the
ledge
by
means
of
its
tackle
lying
flat
on
the
rough
rocks
he
drank
and
drank
of
the
delicious
water
lifting
his
head
for
breath
or
to
gaze
ecstatically
about
him
and
then
thrusting
it
again
into
the
cool
flood
for
the
pleasure
of
feeling
the
water
on
his
hot
cheeks
at
length
a
slight
sound
caused
him
to
turn
quickly
and
look
upward
to
his
dismay
and
astonishment
the
tackle
by
which
he
had
lowered
himself
had
disappeared
unless
he
could
make
up
his
mind
to
swim
for
miles
through
water
of
icy
coldness
he
was
as
truly
a
prisoner
on
that
ledge
of
rock
as
ever
he
had
been
in
the
underground
depths
from
which
he
had
so
recently
escaped
chapter
xix
darrell
folly
and
its
owner
ralph
darrell
was
possessed
by
a
passion
for
accumulating
wealth
and
not
satisfied
with
the
certain
but
slow
gains
of
his
legitimate
business
of
banking
was
always
on
the
lookout
for
extraordinary
investments
in
which
he
was
willing
to
take
great
risks
on
the
chance
of
receiving
proportionate
returns
during
an
excitement
caused
by
marvellous
finds
of
copper
in
the
upper
peninsula
of
michigan
he
too
caught
the
fever
and
became
convinced
that
here
was
his
opportunity
for
acquiring
a
fortune
from
experts
in
whom
he
placed
confidence
he
received
such
good
accounts
of
a
certain
mineral
tract
located
on
keweenaw
point
where
mines
of
fabulous
richness
were
already
opened
that
he
purchased
it
and
persuaded
richard
peveril
father
to
become
associated
with
him
in
a
scheme
for
its
development
when
the
crash
came
and
their
golden
dreams
were
dispelled
by
a
rude
awakening
he
had
sunk
his
own
modest
fortune
together
with
half
of
peveril
in
a
barren
mine
and
the
blow
was
so
heavy
as
to
partially
deprive
him
of
his
reason
he
imagined
himself
to
be
the
object
of
a
conspiracy
headed
by
his
partner
to
obtain
entire
control
of
the
mine
which
he
also
imagined
to
be
immensely
valuable
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
interests
that
he
fancied
to
be
thus
endangered
ralph
darrell
disappeared
from
his
home
made
his
way
to
the
scene
of
his
wrecked
hopes
and
took
up
a
solitary
abode
in
the
deserted
mining
village
although
he
was
now
a
desperate
man
and
also
one
so
crazed
by
misfortune
that
he
believed
every
rock
taken
from
the
copper
princess
to
be
rich
in
metal
he
retained
much
of
the
business
shrewdness
gained
by
years
of
experience
at
the
same
time
he
had
become
sly
suspicious
of
his
fellows
and
absolutely
he
had
conceived
the
idea
of
holding
on
to
the
mine
and
at
the
same
time
spreading
reports
of
its
worthlessness
until
the
term
of
contract
had
expired
when
he
hoped
that
in
default
of
other
claims
the
entire
property
would
fall
into
his
hands
then
he
would
proclaim
its
true
value
and
reap
his
reward
so
he
lived
alone
in
the
comfortable
house
that
had
been
built
for
the
manager
of
the
mine
held
no
intercourse
with
his
widely
scattered
neighbors
discouraged
all
attempts
on
the
part
of
outsiders
to
learn
anything
concerning
him
rejoiced
when
he
heard
his
mine
spoken
of
as
darrell
folly
and
devoted
himself
to
keeping
its
valuable
plant
in
repair
against
the
time
when
he
should
be
free
to
use
it
for
his
own
sole
benefit
in
looking
about
for
some
method
of
acquiring
means
with
which
to
reopen
and
work
the
mine
when
it
should
be
wholly
his
he
ran
across
a
crew
of
canadian
fishermen
who
were
also
smugglers
in
a
small
way
and
joining
them
soon
developed
their
unlawful
trade
into
a
flourishing
business
having
discovered
a
deep
cavern
opening
on
the
lake
and
extending
close
to
the
cellar
of
the
very
house
in
which
he
dwelt
he
decided
to
use
it
as
a
receptacle
and
for
smuggled
goods
to
enhance
its
value
for
this
purpose
he
connected
it
with
his
own
residence
by
an
underground
passage
on
this
he
expended
a
vast
amount
of
labor
digging
it
with
his
own
hands
and
holding
it
a
secret
from
every
human
being
even
the
smugglers
who
implicitly
obeyed
his
orders
since
he
had
made
it
so
profitable
for
them
to
do
so
knew
nothing
of
it
nor
what
became
of
their
goods
after
they
were
delivered
at
night
on
a
certain
rocky
ledge
and
hoisted
up
the
face
of
the
cliff
to
some
place
that
they
never
saw
nor
were
the
peddlers
by
whom
these
same
goods
were
carried
far
and
wide
any
wiser
for
they
always
transacted
their
business
with
old
man
darrell
and
received
their
merchandise
after
dark
in
a
certain
room
of
his
house
the
only
one
they
were
ever
allowed
to
enter
not
only
had
darrell
retained
to
himself
the
secret
of
the
cavern
but
he
had
also
conceived
the
idea
of
hiding
it
from
the
observation
of
passing
vessels
by
means
of
a
canvas
screen
drawn
over
its
entrance
and
cleverly
painted
to
resemble
the
adjacent
cliffs
surrounded
by
these
safeguards
and
further
protected
by
its
locality
in
that
desolate
region
the
unlawful
business
flourished
amazingly
it
not
only
yielded
its
chief
promoter
a
sufficient
income
to
support
his
family
comfortably
in
their
distant
eastern
home
and
enable
him
to
keep
his
in
good
repair
but
each
year
saw
a
very
tidy
surplus
stored
away
for
the
future
development
of
the
copper
princess
darrell
had
learned
of
his
partner
death
and
waited
anxiously
for
years
to
hear
from
the
peveril
heirs
as
they
remained
silent
and
made
no
claim
against
the
property
in
which
his
own
life
was
so
completely
bound
up
he
cherished
the
belief
that
they
considered
it
too
worthless
even
to
investigate
and
that
he
would
be
left
in
undisturbed
possession
to
the
end
he
became
so
emboldened
by
this
belief
that
when
the
term
of
contract
had
so
nearly
expired
that
it
had
but
a
few
months
more
to
run
he
even
began
in
a
small
way
to
resume
work
in
the
mine
thus
he
had
it
pumped
out
and
partially
retimbered
he
also
started
work
on
a
new
level
and
in
every
way
possible
without
attracting
too
much
attention
got
his
property
ready
for
the
great
scheme
of
development
upon
which
he
was
determined
the
moment
he
should
be
freed
from
his
contract
in
the
meantime
his
wife
had
died
and
his
only
child
who
had
been
born
since
he
entered
upon
this
strange
existence
had
come
to
share
his
lonely
home
as
she
was
but
twelve
years
old
when
this
great
change
in
her
life
took
place
she
of
course
knew
nothing
of
business
and
had
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
as
smuggled
goods
in
her
eyes
everything
that
her
dear
papa
did
was
right
and
she
was
too
happy
at
being
permitted
to
become
in
any
degree
his
assistant
to
think
of
questioning
his
methods
so
the
secret
of
the
cavern
and
its
underground
connection
was
finally
confided
to
her
she
was
also
intrusted
with
the
duty
of
watching
for
the
little
vessels
that
brought
the
goods
in
which
her
father
dealt
and
of
hanging
out
the
by
which
their
movements
were
guided
as
these
lights
were
always
displayed
from
the
stunted
cedar
at
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
and
as
this
place
also
served
her
for
a
post
of
observation
she
passed
much
of
her
time
within
the
limits
of
the
great
cave
her
father
had
won
her
promise
never
to
mention
the
existence
of
the
cavern
and
had
also
warned
her
not
to
allow
herself
to
be
seen
in
it
there
was
however
no
necessity
of
such
a
warning
for
mary
darrell
was
too
proud
of
her
great
secret
to
share
it
even
aunty
nimmo
the
old
black
nurse
who
had
come
west
with
her
and
had
remained
to
care
for
her
ever
since
was
not
told
of
the
cavern
though
she
shrewdly
suspected
its
existence
if
to
the
foregoing
explanation
it
is
added
that
the
little
which
were
also
to
all
appearance
never
took
on
their
return
cargoes
from
the
cavern
but
always
at
either
laughing
fish
cove
or
the
basin
the
situation
as
it
existed
at
the
time
of
peveril
appearance
on
the
scene
will
be
understood
as
the
sister
schooner
of
the
one
that
had
carried
off
joe
pintaud
was
due
to
arrive
at
about
this
date
mary
darrell
was
keeping
a
sharp
watch
for
it
and
paying
frequent
visits
to
her
post
of
observation
at
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
for
that
purpose
on
each
of
these
she
of
course
drew
aside
the
painted
curtain
thereby
letting
in
a
rush
of
air
that
penetrated
to
the
innermost
recesses
of
the
great
cavity
behind
her
it
was
a
little
breath
from
one
of
these
that
finding
its
way
through
the
aperture
beside
the
slab
of
rock
and
so
on
down
the
narrow
passage
that
led
to
the
prehistoric
mine
had
blown
out
candle
of
course
the
girl
who
was
the
innocent
cause
of
that
bit
of
mischief
had
no
idea
of
what
the
breeze
was
doing
for
neither
she
nor
her
father
or
any
one
else
for
that
matter
knew
of
the
existence
of
the
old
workings
so
close
at
hand
on
the
following
morning
mary
again
entered
the
cavern
singing
as
she
did
so
this
time
she
remained
but
a
few
minutes
for
she
had
something
to
attend
to
in
the
house
but
she
held
aside
the
canvas
curtain
long
enough
to
look
out
assure
herself
that
no
vessel
was
in
sight
and
to
allow
another
inrush
of
air
from
it
a
second
little
breeze
found
its
way
beneath
the
great
slab
and
into
the
darkness
of
the
underground
passage
where
it
restored
poor
despairing
peveril
to
life
and
hope
by
cooling
his
fevered
brow
and
carrying
the
sound
of
singing
to
his
ears
the
very
next
time
the
girl
entered
the
cavern
she
was
at
first
bewildered
to
find
the
canvas
screen
drawn
aside
from
its
opening
and
the
place
flooded
with
light
next
she
was
frightened
to
note
that
the
derrick
was
swung
outward
and
that
its
attached
tackle
was
hanging
down
out
of
sight
her
first
impulse
was
to
run
and
call
her
father
then
she
remembered
that
as
he
was
down
in
the
mine
it
would
be
a
long
time
before
he
could
come
also
being
a
brave
young
woman
and
not
easily
frightened
she
determined
to
find
out
for
herself
if
there
was
any
real
cause
for
alarm
so
she
crept
softly
to
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
and
peered
cautiously
out
at
sight
of
a
man
lying
on
the
rocks
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
with
his
head
in
the
water
her
heart
almost
stopped
its
beating
and
she
almost
screamed
he
lay
so
still
that
for
a
moment
she
imagined
him
to
be
dead
though
the
next
instant
she
knew
he
was
not
for
he
lifted
his
head
to
catch
a
breath
then
he
again
plunged
it
into
the
water
and
quick
as
thought
the
girl
drew
up
the
tackle
by
which
he
had
lowered
himself
there
she
said
to
herself
i
guess
you
will
stay
where
you
are
mister
man
until
i
can
bring
papa
and
he
know
what
to
do
with
you
she
had
drawn
in
the
tackle
very
cautiously
without
noticing
the
little
scraping
noise
that
its
lower
block
made
in
crossing
the
rocky
ledge
and
she
turned
to
go
as
she
spoke
but
she
must
take
one
more
look
just
to
see
if
that
horrid
man
was
still
there
and
what
he
was
doing
so
she
very
carefully
leaned
forward
and
gazed
straight
down
into
the
upturned
face
of
richard
peveril
chapter
xx
peveril
is
taken
for
a
ghost
the
situation
in
which
the
two
principal
characters
of
this
story
were
left
at
the
close
of
the
preceding
chapter
was
so
embarrassing
to
both
that
for
several
seconds
they
continued
to
stare
at
each
other
in
silent
amazement
mary
darrell
her
face
alternately
flushing
and
paling
with
confusion
seemed
fascinated
and
incapable
of
motion
in
spite
of
peveril
astonishingly
disreputable
appearance
she
at
once
recognized
him
as
being
the
young
stranger
whom
she
had
seen
twice
before
and
had
even
helped
out
of
an
awkward
predicament
she
also
knew
that
he
had
in
some
way
aroused
her
father
enmity
but
he
had
taken
his
departure
from
that
vicinity
several
days
earlier
and
though
she
had
wondered
if
he
would
ever
come
back
she
had
not
really
expected
to
see
him
again
now
to
come
upon
him
so
suddenly
looking
so
dreadful
and
to
realize
that
incredible
as
it
seemed
he
must
have
learned
the
secret
of
the
cavern
was
all
so
bewildering
and
startling
as
to
very
nearly
take
away
her
breath
so
she
simply
stared
it
must
be
confessed
that
peveril
present
appearance
was
not
so
prepossessing
as
it
had
been
at
other
times
and
might
be
again
he
had
lost
his
hat
his
hair
was
uncombed
his
hands
were
bruised
and
soiled
while
his
clothing
was
torn
and
covered
with
dirt
from
the
underground
passages
through
which
he
had
so
recently
struggled
but
his
face
was
quite
clean
for
he
had
just
given
it
a
thorough
scrubbing
and
to
it
the
girl
gaze
was
principally
directed
it
was
peveril
who
first
broke
the
embarrassing
silence
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
again
he
said
and
to
find
that
you
are
a
real
girl
instead
of
only
a
vision
or
a
sort
of
a
as
i
imagined
you
might
be
from
the
way
you
disappeared
that
other
time
what
makes
you
think
i
am
a
girl
asked
mary
darrell
whose
face
was
the
only
part
of
her
that
peveril
could
see
why
because
he
began
hesitatingly
because
you
are
too
to
be
anything
but
a
girl
and
because
oh
well
because
i
am
certain
that
you
are
what
else
could
you
be
anyway
mary
darrell
face
was
crimson
but
still
she
answered
stoutly
i
might
be
a
boy
you
know
no
indeed
no
boy
could
blush
as
you
are
doing
at
this
moment
in
reply
the
girl
rose
to
her
feet
and
stepped
out
on
the
ledge
in
full
view
of
the
young
man
she
was
clad
in
a
golf
suit
and
becoming
but
masculine
in
every
detail
she
had
become
so
accustomed
to
dressing
in
that
way
that
she
was
perfectly
at
her
ease
in
the
costume
and
even
preferred
it
to
her
own
proper
garments
i
beg
your
pardon
stammered
poor
peveril
as
he
gazed
in
bewilderment
at
the
apparition
thus
presented
i
awfully
ashamed
to
have
made
such
a
stupid
mistake
but
really
you
know
oh
it
all
right
replied
the
other
and
you
need
apologize
i
have
so
often
been
taken
for
a
girl
that
i
am
quite
used
to
it
and
now
may
i
ask
who
you
are
why
you
are
here
what
you
are
doing
down
there
how
you
propose
to
get
away
and
hold
on
my
dear
fellow
interrupted
peveril
do
you
think
your
list
of
questions
is
already
long
enough
without
adding
any
more
i
suppose
it
is
laughed
the
other
assuming
a
seat
in
an
expectant
attitude
at
the
base
of
the
stunted
cedar
the
novelty
of
the
situation
combined
with
its
absolute
safety
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
was
fascinating
to
the
lonely
girl
now
you
may
begin
she
added
and
tell
me
everything
you
know
about
yourself
that
would
be
altogether
too
long
a
story
replied
peveril
a
little
nettled
at
what
he
mentally
termed
the
cheek
of
the
youth
besides
he
continued
i
am
too
nearly
starved
to
do
much
talking
seeing
that
for
more
days
than
i
can
remember
i
have
had
nothing
to
eat
but
a
rat
and
a
rat
cried
the
other
in
a
tone
of
horror
you
did
really
eat
a
rat
indeed
i
did
and
i
would
gladly
eat
another
at
this
very
minute
i
am
so
hungry
do
you
think
you
could
get
me
one
or
if
you
had
any
cold
victuals
that
you
could
spare
at
that
moment
mary
darrell
without
waiting
to
hear
another
word
jumped
up
and
disappeared
leaving
peveril
to
wonder
what
had
struck
the
young
fellow
and
hoping
that
he
had
gone
for
something
in
the
shape
of
food
i
wish
i
got
him
to
let
down
that
rope
again
first
he
said
to
himself
as
he
paced
back
and
forth
across
the
ledge
then
i
could
have
pulled
myself
up
and
gone
with
him
thereby
saving
both
time
and
trouble
i
would
have
sworn
though
that
he
was
a
girl
never
was
so
deceived
in
my
life
he
must
have
a
sister
and
perhaps
they
are
twins
for
it
surely
was
a
girl
that
i
saw
here
the
other
time
all
the
same
i
rather
glad
she
is
on
hand
just
now
for
i
should
hate
to
have
any
girl
see
me
in
my
present
disguise
my
appearance
must
be
decidedly
tough
and
wonder
if
i
ca
do
something
to
improve
it
that
chap
might
be
just
idiot
enough
to
bring
his
sister
back
with
him
thus
thinking
the
young
man
attempted
to
get
a
look
at
himself
in
the
of
the
lake
and
was
trying
to
comb
his
hair
with
his
fingers
when
a
merry
laugh
from
above
put
an
end
to
his
toilet
and
caused
him
to
start
up
in
confusion
his
young
friend
of
the
golf
suit
had
returned
and
was
letting
down
a
small
basket
attached
to
a
stout
cord
why
do
you
drop
the
tackle
and
let
me
come
up
there
to
you
suggested
peveril
who
was
not
only
very
tired
of
the
ledge
but
curious
to
make
a
closer
acquaintance
with
his
new
friend
oh
no
said
the
other
hurriedly
i
ca
do
that
but
look
out
catch
the
basket
i
am
sorry
not
to
have
brought
you
a
better
lunch
but
you
seemed
in
such
a
hurry
that
i
thought
you
might
not
be
particular
it
fine
rejoined
peveril
who
was
already
making
a
ravenous
attack
on
the
bread
and
cold
meat
contained
in
the
basket
you
could
have
brought
me
anything
that
i
should
have
liked
better
or
that
would
have
done
me
more
good
and
i
am
a
thousand
times
obliged
a
few
minutes
of
silence
ensued
after
this
while
the
one
in
the
golf
suit
eagerly
watched
the
other
satisfy
his
hunger
when
the
last
crumb
of
food
had
disappeared
peveril
heaved
a
sigh
of
content
i
feel
like
a
new
man
now
he
said
and
if
you
will
only
be
so
kind
as
to
throw
down
that
tackle
but
you
have
answered
a
single
one
of
my
questions
interrupted
the
other
ca
i
do
that
up
there
as
well
as
here
no
i
want
them
answered
right
off
now
well
you
are
a
queer
sort
of
a
chap
retorted
peveril
but
seeing
that
you
were
so
kind
about
the
lunch
i
do
mind
humoring
you
a
bit
let
me
see
what
were
they
oh
first
who
am
i
well
i
am
richard
peveril
but
beyond
that
i
hardly
know
how
to
answer
second
why
am
i
here
because
i
ca
get
away
third
what
am
i
doing
answering
questions
fourth
how
do
i
propose
to
get
away
by
climbing
the
rope
that
you
will
let
down
to
me
of
course
and
then
have
you
show
me
the
same
way
out
of
the
cavern
that
you
take
illustration
at
seeing
peveril
the
men
uttered
a
cry
of
terror
oh
but
i
ca
do
that
why
not
because
i
have
promised
never
to
show
it
to
any
one
but
if
you
do
know
the
way
how
did
you
get
into
the
cavern
if
you
show
me
your
way
out
i
show
you
mine
replied
peveril
who
was
growing
impatient
i
tell
you
i
ca
it
is
simply
impossible
oh
well
i
wo
urge
you
then
only
let
down
the
rope
so
that
i
can
get
up
to
where
you
are
and
i
manage
to
find
my
own
way
out
but
i
do
dare
even
to
do
that
answered
the
other
in
genuine
distress
you
do
mean
to
leave
me
down
here
forever
do
you
no
of
course
not
but
oh
i
know
i
send
a
boat
for
you
so
just
wait
patiently
a
little
while
longer
and
you
shall
be
taken
off
i
say
hold
on
cried
richard
but
his
words
were
unheeded
for
acting
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
the
other
had
disappeared
and
he
was
talking
to
empty
space
confound
the
boy
he
exclaimed
impatiently
i
never
heard
of
anything
so
utterly
absurd
why
in
the
name
of
should
he
object
to
showing
me
the
way
out
of
his
old
cave
one
would
think
that
ordinary
humanity
but
boys
are
such
heartless
young
beggars
that
there
no
such
thing
as
appealing
to
their
sympathies
if
it
had
only
been
his
sister
now
in
the
meantime
mary
darrell
had
hastened
from
the
cavern
full
of
her
new
plan
for
rescuing
the
prisoner
without
betraying
the
secret
of
the
underground
passage
she
at
first
thought
of
appealing
to
her
father
for
aid
but
remembering
his
bitterness
against
the
young
man
decided
to
act
without
him
so
she
called
two
miners
who
were
at
work
about
the
mouth
of
the
shaft
and
bade
them
follow
her
as
they
did
so
she
led
the
way
to
the
basin
and
entering
a
boat
ordered
the
men
to
row
her
out
into
the
lake
they
obeyed
without
hesitation
and
as
mary
steered
she
soon
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
her
prisoner
just
where
she
had
left
him
he
was
at
the
same
time
relieved
of
a
growing
anxiety
by
the
approach
of
the
boat
in
which
he
finally
recognized
the
young
fellow
who
although
acting
so
curiously
had
on
the
whole
proved
himself
a
friend
the
boat
approached
so
close
to
the
ledge
that
mary
had
given
the
order
to
cease
rowing
before
the
oarsmen
turned
their
heads
to
see
where
they
were
as
they
did
so
they
uttered
a
simultaneous
cry
of
terror
again
seized
their
oars
whirled
their
light
craft
around
and
in
spite
of
mary
darrell
angry
protestations
began
to
row
with
frantic
haste
back
in
the
direction
from
which
they
had
come
although
peveril
was
not
so
much
surprised
at
this
proceeding
as
he
might
have
been
had
he
not
recognized
the
villain
rothsky
in
the
he
was
bitterly
disappointed
and
paced
up
and
down
his
narrow
prison
with
restless
impatience
oh
if
i
ever
get
out
of
this
scrape
he
cried
less
than
an
hour
afterwards
when
mary
darrell
again
entered
the
cavern
but
this
time
in
company
with
her
father
to
whom
she
had
confided
the
whole
story
peveril
had
disappeared
there
was
no
boat
to
be
seen
and
they
were
confident
that
none
had
been
on
the
coast
that
day
the
derrick
with
its
tackle
was
just
as
mary
had
left
it
yet
neither
in
the
cavern
nor
on
the
ledge
was
a
trace
of
the
young
man
to
be
seen
chapter
xxi
mike
connell
to
the
rescue
on
the
very
day
that
the
white
pine
logging
expedition
had
been
so
completely
disbanded
the
tug
had
been
sent
up
the
coast
in
a
hurry
after
a
supply
of
timber
she
reached
laughing
fish
cove
in
the
evening
after
peveril
departure
from
his
camp
and
spent
the
night
there
awaiting
him
her
captain
was
greatly
perplexed
by
the
failure
of
any
of
the
party
to
put
in
an
appearance
and
the
more
so
when
he
learned
from
the
fishermen
that
peveril
had
returned
alone
only
to
depart
again
on
foot
soon
afterwards
by
morning
he
dared
not
wait
longer
for
his
instructions
were
to
start
back
immediately
with
such
logs
as
had
been
collected
he
also
imagined
that
having
picked
up
all
the
timber
they
could
find
and
becoming
tired
of
waiting
for
him
the
wreckers
might
have
set
out
for
red
jacket
on
foot
so
taking
in
tow
the
raft
that
he
found
in
the
cove
he
started
down
the
coast
arriving
at
his
destination
that
same
evening
mike
connell
who
had
been
anxiously
awaiting
peveril
coming
was
at
the
landing
to
meet
his
friend
and
was
much
disappointed
at
his
after
gaining
all
the
news
concerning
the
missing
party
that
captain
spillins
could
give
him
he
hastened
back
to
red
jacket
and
went
at
once
to
the
trefethen
cottage
with
a
faint
hope
that
peveril
might
be
there
the
inmates
of
the
little
house
had
also
pleasantly
anticipated
the
return
of
the
young
man
in
whom
they
were
so
interested
and
had
made
such
simple
preparations
as
came
within
their
means
for
welcoming
him
now
their
disappointment
at
connell
report
was
mingled
with
a
certain
anxiety
that
increased
as
they
discussed
the
situation
i
feared
lad
got
into
some
trouble
along
of
they
furriners
reflected
mark
trefethen
as
he
puffed
thoughtfully
at
his
short
pipe
not
but
he
find
way
outen
it
though
for
he
finely
strong
and
handy
wi
his
fists
still
there
always
the
knives
and
deviltry
of
they
furriners
to
be
reckoned
with
they
do
tell
as
hit
a
cruel
country
up
yon
full
o
thieves
and
murderers
to
say
naught
o
smuggling
pirates
put
in
his
wife
which
as
i
were
saying
to
miss
penny
no
longer
ago
than
yesterday
when
me
and
was
looking
in
at
company
store
the
same
as
maister
peril
should
be
running
this
blessed
minute
if
rights
penny
sez
i
pore
young
man
never
get
it
in
this
world
now
gone
for
a
sailor
mark
my
words
little
thinking
they
so
soon
come
true
if
i
was
a
man
said
nelly
trefethen
at
the
same
time
casting
a
meaning
glance
at
her
sweetheart
i
not
be
sitting
here
wondering
how
he
to
be
got
out
of
trouble
especially
if
he
done
for
me
what
he
has
for
some
no
more
will
i
spoke
up
mike
connell
for
i
going
to
find
him
which
is
what
i
came
to
say
along
with
telling
the
news
and
i
go
with
you
exclaimed
tom
trefethen
springing
to
his
feet
as
though
for
an
immediate
start
no
tom
glad
as
i
be
of
your
company
it
best
i
should
go
alone
seeing
as
i
know
that
country
well
and
one
man
can
get
along
in
it
when
two
could
besides
you
are
needed
here
while
i
not
in
spite
of
young
trefethen
protests
the
irishman
remained
firm
in
his
decision
to
set
forth
alone
in
search
of
his
friend
and
as
he
left
the
house
nelly
who
with
the
others
accompanied
him
to
the
door
managed
to
give
his
hand
an
approving
squeeze
although
major
arkell
gave
orders
for
the
tug
to
return
to
laughing
fish
in
search
of
the
missing
loggers
the
moment
her
services
could
be
spared
it
was
not
until
hours
after
bringing
in
the
raft
that
it
was
possible
for
her
to
do
so
in
the
meantime
mike
connell
starting
at
the
break
of
day
and
walking
briskly
northward
reached
the
cove
that
still
held
deserted
camp
that
same
afternoon
through
an
intimacy
with
several
of
his
countrymen
who
were
successful
peddlers
of
ralph
darrell
smuggled
goods
connell
had
learned
much
concerning
that
section
of
country
and
the
various
operations
conducted
within
its
limits
he
had
at
one
time
seriously
contemplated
going
into
the
peddling
business
himself
and
had
made
so
many
inquiries
in
regard
to
its
details
that
he
was
even
familiar
with
darrell
folly
though
it
was
a
place
he
had
never
visited
knowing
it
to
be
a
headquarters
for
smugglers
and
believing
that
if
peveril
had
really
got
himself
into
trouble
it
would
be
in
connection
with
some
of
those
people
he
felt
that
it
was
a
likely
locality
in
which
to
search
for
information
accordingly
he
headed
directly
for
it
only
going
a
short
distance
out
of
his
way
to
visit
laughing
fish
cove
having
heard
that
the
were
in
league
with
the
smugglers
he
did
not
care
to
betray
his
presence
to
them
and
so
did
not
show
himself
in
the
little
settlement
but
only
skirted
it
until
certain
that
his
friends
were
not
there
then
he
proceeded
towards
his
destination
by
the
same
trail
that
peveril
had
followed
only
two
nights
before
as
he
walked
slowly
along
the
narrow
pathway
trying
to
invent
some
plausible
excuse
for
presenting
himself
before
the
irascible
old
man
who
he
had
heard
excluded
all
strangers
from
darrell
folly
his
steps
were
arrested
by
the
sound
of
voices
approaching
from
the
opposite
direction
in
another
moment
he
saw
three
men
hurrying
towards
him
gesticulating
wildly
and
talking
loudly
in
an
unknown
tongue
as
they
drew
near
he
recognized
in
them
the
three
recently
driven
from
the
white
pine
mine
it
also
flashed
into
his
mind
that
these
were
the
men
whom
he
had
urged
to
make
a
cowardly
attack
on
the
young
fellow
he
had
then
considered
an
enemy
but
for
whom
he
was
now
searching
as
for
a
dear
friend
the
also
recognized
him
and
regarding
him
as
of
one
purpose
with
themselves
in
all
that
concerned
peveril
did
not
hesitate
to
advance
and
speak
to
him
after
an
exchange
of
greetings
connell
broached
the
business
in
hand
by
asking
if
they
had
seen
anything
in
those
parts
of
the
chap
who
had
driven
them
from
white
pine
the
men
glanced
at
each
other
hesitatingly
for
a
moment
and
then
rothsky
answered
yes
my
friend
indeed
we
have
seen
him
and
to
our
sorrow
since
it
is
but
now
that
he
has
driven
us
from
another
job
better
even
than
that
how
so
inquired
connell
pricking
up
his
ears
it
is
this
way
we
are
working
at
good
wages
for
the
old
fool
over
yonder
when
that
devil
of
a
comes
and
tries
to
steal
our
timbers
then
the
boss
compels
us
to
seize
him
and
put
him
in
his
boat
which
we
tow
far
out
in
the
lake
then
as
he
makes
a
try
to
escape
the
boss
who
is
like
a
man
crazy
shoots
him
with
a
pistol
through
the
head
and
we
all
see
him
fall
without
life
in
the
bottom
of
his
boat
he
is
so
very
dead
that
he
does
not
even
move
and
so
is
let
go
to
drift
him
and
his
boat
while
we
return
to
shore
a
fine
way
of
treating
trespassers
bedad
exclaimed
connell
but
all
the
same
there
is
folks
who
would
call
it
murder
yes
was
it
not
but
wait
all
that
was
three
days
ago
and
yet
but
one
hour
since
two
of
us
have
seen
the
ghost
of
this
beast
standing
on
the
black
rocks
with
the
white
face
of
death
the
wet
hair
of
the
drowned
and
his
clothing
torn
by
the
teeth
of
fishes
he
said
not
one
word
but
waited
for
us
and
would
have
dragged
us
to
the
bottom
if
we
had
not
fled
in
time
now
with
such
things
allowed
we
can
no
longer
work
in
this
place
and
so
for
the
second
time
has
he
driven
us
from
our
good
job
it
a
cruel
shame
and
an
outrage
on
dacency
nothing
less
cried
connell
in
pretended
indignation
at
the
same
time
rothsky
man
i
like
to
have
been
with
you
for
do
you
know
i
never
laid
eyes
on
a
ghost
at
all
but
would
like
mightily
to
have
the
exparience
would
ye
mind
tellin
me
now
where
could
i
find
this
one
just
for
the
pleasure
of
the
sensation
no
no
mist
connell
do
go
near
it
for
you
be
going
to
your
death
if
you
do
but
if
i
willing
to
risk
it
why
not
so
the
irishman
insisted
that
they
should
permit
him
to
share
with
them
the
glory
of
having
seen
a
ghost
and
finally
won
from
them
full
directions
how
to
discover
the
place
from
which
they
had
fled
in
terror
the
sly
fellow
even
made
pretence
of
wishing
them
to
go
back
with
him
and
when
they
declined
to
consider
his
invitation
declared
them
to
be
a
set
of
cowards
and
set
forth
alone
it
my
belief
he
said
to
himself
as
he
made
his
way
towards
the
place
where
they
had
told
him
he
would
find
a
boat
that
them
divils
of
dagos
have
played
some
dirty
trick
on
mister
peril
if
there
been
but
two
of
them
i
found
some
way
of
extorting
a
confession
from
their
lying
mouths
but
odds
of
three
to
one
is
too
big
to
risk
so
i
had
to
blarney
them
but
maybe
i
be
able
to
help
the
lad
some
way
and
anyhow
here
for
the
trying
it
was
dusk
when
connell
having
found
the
boat
pulled
unobserved
out
of
the
basin
and
by
the
time
he
reached
the
ledge
where
he
had
been
told
he
would
find
peveril
ghost
darkness
had
so
closed
in
that
he
could
not
tell
whether
it
was
occupied
or
not
until
he
had
left
his
craft
and
explored
its
limited
area
mister
peril
he
called
softly
come
out
if
you
hiding
for
it
only
me
mike
connell
come
to
take
you
away
from
this
oh
bad
cess
to
it
he
not
here
at
all
and
it
a
great
them
dagos
give
me
now
i
have
to
go
and
beg
a
night
lodging
of
the
old
man
and
maybe
he
give
me
a
job
in
place
of
them
as
has
just
left
him
in
that
case
i
find
out
something
or
me
name
not
holy
smoke
where
me
boat
bad
luck
to
the
slippery
craft
it
gone
entirely
and
here
i
am
left
to
spend
the
cruel
night
alone
on
a
bit
of
a
rock
in
the
sea
if
i
was
in
jail
i
be
better
off
it
was
only
too
true
the
light
skiff
carelessly
left
to
its
own
devices
had
been
caught
by
a
gentle
breeze
and
borne
without
a
sound
beyond
sight
or
hearing
as
the
second
prisoner
claimed
by
the
black
ledge
that
day
stood
dismally
bemoaning
his
hard
fate
a
light
flashed
out
above
him
and
glancing
upward
he
saw
what
he
took
to
be
a
man
in
the
act
of
hanging
two
lanterns
to
a
bit
of
a
tree
it
was
a
warning
the
smugglers
to
keep
away
and
mary
darrell
was
placing
it
by
order
of
her
father
who
feared
peveril
might
still
be
lingering
in
that
vicinity
hey
lad
cried
connell
noting
her
slight
figure
will
you
help
a
in
distress
by
tossing
down
the
end
of
a
rope
are
you
really
still
there
exclaimed
the
girl
in
a
tone
of
dismay
and
striving
to
peer
down
through
the
darkness
i
am
that
but
most
anxious
to
get
away
and
if
i
do
let
down
the
rope
will
you
promise
to
depart
at
once
the
same
way
you
came
i
promise
anything
if
you
only
let
me
up
well
then
there
it
is
i
know
i
am
doing
wrong
but
i
ca
leave
you
down
there
all
night
for
you
would
be
dead
by
morning
true
for
ye
answered
connell
as
he
began
briskly
to
climb
the
rope
hand
over
hand
as
his
face
appeared
within
the
circle
of
the
poor
girl
who
was
waiting
with
trembling
anxiety
uttered
a
cry
of
terror
and
fled
into
the
gloom
of
the
cavern
well
if
that
do
bate
my
time
exclaimed
the
as
he
gained
a
foothold
on
the
ledge
whatever
could
the
lad
be
frightened
of
chapter
xxii
the
signal
is
changed
peveril
had
been
amazed
and
disgusted
at
the
sudden
turning
about
and
departure
of
the
boat
that
had
so
nearly
effected
his
rescue
of
course
on
recognizing
the
oarsmen
he
understood
why
they
declined
to
help
him
though
it
did
not
enter
his
mind
that
they
regarded
him
as
a
supernatural
being
what
cowards
they
are
he
reflected
bitterly
they
are
determined
to
kill
me
though
that
is
evident
and
i
do
believe
they
will
be
content
with
simply
leaving
me
here
to
die
of
exposure
it
more
than
likely
they
will
roll
rocks
down
on
me
from
the
cliffs
during
the
night
there
a
cheerful
prospect
to
contemplate
with
darkness
already
coming
on
too
that
young
fellow
seemed
willing
enough
to
help
me
only
he
was
bound
to
do
it
in
his
own
way
but
now
i
suppose
those
wretches
will
prevent
him
from
making
any
more
efforts
in
my
behalf
what
is
he
doing
with
that
gang
of
murderers
i
wonder
apparently
he
is
about
as
far
removed
from
that
class
as
a
person
can
be
well
that
neither
here
nor
there
the
one
thing
to
be
considered
just
now
is
how
am
i
to
get
out
of
this
fix
i
wonder
if
there
is
any
possibility
of
that
cord
bearing
my
weight
the
cord
thus
referred
to
was
the
one
by
which
the
basket
of
food
had
been
lowered
as
it
still
hung
close
at
hand
peveril
gave
it
a
sharp
pull
although
it
yielded
slightly
it
did
not
break
and
encouraged
by
this
he
threw
his
whole
weight
on
it
as
a
conclusive
test
of
its
strength
the
result
was
sudden
surprising
and
wellnigh
disastrous
the
cord
gave
way
so
readily
that
peveril
sprawled
at
full
length
on
the
rocks
while
at
the
same
time
something
heavy
fell
with
a
rush
down
the
face
of
the
cliff
and
struck
with
great
force
close
beside
his
head
springing
to
his
feet
in
alarm
at
this
most
unexpected
happening
the
prisoner
found
to
his
amazement
and
also
to
his
delight
that
he
had
pulled
down
the
by
which
he
had
descended
to
be
sure
the
block
at
its
lower
end
had
very
nearly
dashed
out
his
brains
but
what
did
he
care
for
that
so
long
as
he
had
been
given
the
benefit
of
the
miss
for
a
moment
he
was
puzzled
to
know
how
his
pull
on
the
cord
could
have
effected
so
desirable
a
result
but
upon
an
examination
of
the
tackle
he
laughed
aloud
at
the
simplicity
of
the
proposition
for
want
of
something
better
to
hold
her
end
of
the
cord
mary
darrell
had
tied
it
to
the
block
of
the
intending
of
course
to
draw
up
the
basket
again
as
soon
as
her
starving
guest
had
emptied
it
then
absorbed
in
a
suddenly
evolved
plan
for
releasing
him
from
his
predicament
and
at
the
same
time
preserving
her
father
secret
she
had
gone
away
and
neglected
to
do
so
peveril
was
not
slow
to
avail
himself
of
the
means
of
escape
thus
provided
and
a
few
minutes
later
stood
once
more
within
the
portal
of
the
great
cavern
his
first
care
was
to
haul
up
the
tackle
and
dispose
it
as
he
imagined
it
to
have
been
left
with
the
attached
cord
hanging
down
the
face
of
the
cliff
there
he
said
when
this
was
done
to
his
satisfaction
the
young
fellow
is
almost
certain
to
come
back
for
another
look
at
me
and
though
i
fancy
he
be
somewhat
surprised
to
find
me
gone
it
will
never
enter
his
head
that
i
am
up
here
then
when
he
leaves
i
will
simply
follow
his
lead
and
so
find
the
way
out
of
this
mysterious
place
perhaps
though
i
can
discover
it
for
myself
thus
thinking
peveril
made
as
careful
an
examination
of
the
cavern
walls
as
the
fading
light
would
permit
but
could
find
no
sign
of
an
opening
finally
deciding
to
carry
out
his
original
plan
he
selected
a
and
settling
himself
in
it
as
comfortably
as
possible
began
to
await
with
what
patience
he
might
the
return
of
his
young
friend
by
this
time
the
cavern
was
quite
dark
save
for
a
dim
twilight
at
its
opening
and
having
nothing
to
distract
his
attention
he
began
to
realize
how
very
weary
he
was
after
the
exertions
and
nervous
strain
of
the
past
three
days
he
had
also
just
eaten
a
hearty
meal
it
is
little
wonder
then
that
within
five
minutes
and
in
spite
of
his
strenuous
exertions
to
keep
awake
he
fell
fast
asleep
fortunately
he
did
not
snore
nor
make
any
sound
to
betray
his
presence
but
unfortunately
also
his
slumber
was
so
profound
that
when
a
little
later
mary
darrell
and
her
father
softly
entered
the
gallery
and
cautiously
proceeded
to
its
mouth
for
a
look
at
the
prisoner
whom
they
supposed
still
to
be
on
the
black
ledge
he
did
not
waken
puzzled
as
they
were
at
his
disappearance
they
were
also
greatly
relieved
to
have
him
gone
they
never
for
a
moment
imagined
that
he
could
have
regained
the
cavern
and
so
after
drawing
up
the
basket
they
retired
as
they
had
come
leaving
peveril
undisturbed
to
his
nap
while
it
was
not
certain
that
the
expected
smuggling
schooner
would
reach
the
coast
that
evening
she
might
do
so
and
with
the
cautiousness
marking
all
of
his
operations
ralph
darrell
decided
that
it
would
not
do
for
her
cargo
to
be
landed
while
there
was
a
chance
of
a
stranger
who
was
at
the
same
time
an
enemy
being
in
the
neighborhood
he
felt
assured
that
the
young
man
who
had
so
mysteriously
appeared
and
disappeared
that
day
must
be
an
enemy
for
though
mary
had
not
mentioned
his
name
she
had
described
him
as
being
the
one
who
had
recently
attempted
to
steal
his
logs
from
the
basin
now
he
had
no
doubt
that
the
chap
was
a
who
had
come
to
spy
out
his
smuggling
operations
and
only
pretended
to
be
in
search
of
wrecked
timber
as
a
cloak
for
his
real
designs
else
why
should
he
still
hang
around
and
especially
in
the
vicinity
of
the
cavern
where
there
were
no
logs
mary
even
declared
a
belief
that
he
had
been
in
their
carefully
concealed
but
of
course
she
must
be
mistaken
still
no
more
cargo
must
be
landed
until
the
spy
was
located
and
driven
from
that
region
i
need
to
carry
on
the
business
much
longer
said
the
old
man
to
himself
but
so
long
as
i
choose
to
remain
in
it
i
propose
to
be
interfered
with
so
mary
was
directed
to
go
and
display
two
lanterns
at
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
as
a
signal
that
no
goods
were
to
be
landed
that
night
while
her
father
went
out
for
the
final
look
at
his
precious
mining
property
that
he
took
every
evening
just
after
the
men
had
quit
work
ralph
darrell
heart
was
bound
up
in
the
new
work
he
had
recently
began
and
so
anxious
was
he
to
push
it
that
he
was
engaging
all
laborers
who
came
that
way
as
yet
his
force
was
very
small
but
he
was
in
hopes
of
speedily
increasing
it
thus
to
discover
that
three
of
his
strongest
men
had
suddenly
thrown
up
their
jobs
and
left
him
without
warning
filled
him
with
anger
so
furious
was
he
even
after
he
entered
the
house
that
poor
mary
who
had
just
returned
badly
frightened
from
the
cavern
dared
not
confess
to
him
that
through
her
own
carelessness
another
stranger
had
been
admitted
to
the
hidden
storehouse
of
the
cliffs
perhaps
by
morning
this
unwelcome
visitor
would
have
disappeared
as
the
other
had
done
and
at
any
rate
he
could
never
find
the
secret
passage
for
it
was
too
carefully
concealed
by
morning
too
her
father
would
be
restored
to
his
ordinary
frame
of
mind
and
it
would
be
easier
to
tell
him
what
she
had
done
if
indeed
it
should
prove
necessary
to
tell
him
at
all
in
the
meantime
mike
connell
was
much
puzzled
by
the
nature
of
the
place
in
which
he
found
himself
after
his
climb
as
well
as
by
the
abrupt
disappearance
of
the
lad
upon
whom
he
had
counted
for
guidance
the
darkness
with
its
accompanying
profound
silence
so
affected
him
that
while
he
called
several
times
whist
now
where
are
you
come
out
o
that
young
feller
and
have
done
with
your
foolin
he
did
so
in
an
awed
tone
but
little
above
a
whisper
all
right
stay
where
you
are
then
he
added
after
listening
vainly
for
a
reply
if
it
a
game
of
ye
want
i
can
soon
accommodate
you
seeing
as
how
you
been
so
kind
as
to
leave
me
a
couple
of
glims
though
it
only
one
of
them
i
need
thus
saying
the
removed
one
of
the
two
lanterns
that
had
been
hung
out
as
a
warning
to
the
smugglers
and
unwittingly
changed
the
into
one
of
safety
and
invitation
by
so
doing
with
the
lantern
thus
acquired
to
light
his
footsteps
he
began
a
careful
survey
of
the
cavern
hoping
to
discover
either
an
exit
from
it
or
his
vanished
guide
with
his
previous
knowledge
of
the
principal
industry
of
that
region
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
conjecture
the
meaning
of
the
bales
and
boxes
upon
which
he
soon
stumbled
holy
smoke
he
cried
it
a
cave
of
smugglers
you
broke
into
mike
connell
no
less
and
a
sorrowful
time
ye
have
of
it
if
the
folks
comes
home
and
catches
you
at
the
trespassing
where
the
divil
is
the
back
door
i
wonder
for
the
one
in
front
is
no
good
at
all
saints
preserve
us
what
that
with
this
last
exclamation
the
frightened
irishman
began
to
retreat
slowly
backward
holding
his
lantern
so
that
while
it
revealed
his
own
face
its
light
also
fell
full
on
the
form
of
richard
peveril
standing
before
him
and
staring
in
blankest
amazement
plaze
good
mister
spook
i
mean
yer
honor
oh
holy
fathers
what
will
i
say
stammered
the
poor
fellow
in
such
faltering
accents
that
peveril
broke
into
a
roar
of
laughter
mike
connell
he
cried
wherever
did
you
come
from
and
what
has
happened
you
look
as
though
you
had
seen
a
ghost
and
have
i
retorted
the
other
still
staring
dubiously
is
it
yourself
lad
but
sure
it
must
be
seeing
you
have
a
voice
of
your
own
which
is
a
thing
never
yet
given
to
a
spook
glory
be
to
goodness
mister
peril
that
i
found
you
just
as
i
lost
you
entirely
and
meself
as
well
but
how
do
you
happen
to
be
here
asked
the
still
bewildered
peveril
sure
i
just
came
thinking
you
might
want
me
which
way
did
you
come
through
the
front
door
the
same
as
yourself
but
i
came
in
by
a
back
entrance
then
we
best
be
getting
out
that
way
for
i
afeard
there
soon
be
others
here
as
wo
be
pleased
to
see
us
we
ca
for
that
way
is
barred
answered
peveril
but
let
us
sit
down
and
try
to
arrive
at
some
understanding
of
this
mysterious
affair
so
for
nearly
an
hour
the
two
talked
over
the
situation
and
though
each
frequently
interrupted
the
other
with
questions
or
exclamations
they
finally
gained
a
pretty
clear
comprehension
of
their
position
at
the
end
of
the
conference
peveril
exclaimed
then
so
far
as
i
can
see
we
are
shut
up
here
like
two
rats
in
a
trap
yes
cried
connell
and
here
comes
the
after
us
now
as
he
spoke
he
pointed
to
the
outer
entrance
where
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
man
had
just
appeared
above
the
rocky
ledge
chapter
xxiii
a
battle
with
smugglers
after
supper
that
same
evening
the
violence
of
ralph
darrell
rage
had
so
subsided
that
his
daughter
ventured
to
inquire
concerning
its
cause
when
he
had
informed
her
she
said
why
should
you
let
a
little
thing
like
that
worry
you
papa
surely
you
can
engage
plenty
more
miners
if
you
want
them
i
do
see
why
you
should
bother
with
the
old
mine
though
it
do
seem
to
be
worth
anything
not
worth
anything
cried
the
old
man
standing
up
in
his
excitement
why
child
it
is
worth
millions
it
is
one
of
the
richest
copper
properties
in
the
world
and
in
one
week
time
it
will
be
all
my
own
rather
it
will
be
yours
since
it
is
for
you
alone
that
i
have
lived
in
this
wilderness
all
these
years
thereby
saving
it
from
destruction
and
warding
off
the
conspiracy
that
would
reduce
you
to
beggary
for
your
sake
only
have
i
so
guarded
the
secret
of
its
wealth
that
no
living
soul
suspects
it
even
the
men
who
delve
in
its
depths
know
not
the
value
of
the
material
in
which
they
toil
for
i
have
not
told
them
nor
have
i
allowed
an
assay
to
be
made
of
its
smallest
fragment
but
i
know
its
worth
its
fabulous
value
that
will
make
the
owner
of
the
copper
princess
one
of
the
richest
heiresses
in
the
world
who
is
the
copper
princess
papa
asked
the
girl
who
though
bewildered
by
the
old
man
extravagant
statements
could
not
help
but
be
interested
in
them
you
are
my
darling
you
are
a
copper
princess
but
the
name
also
applies
to
your
mine
and
was
given
to
it
before
you
were
born
folly
is
what
men
in
their
ignorance
call
it
now
but
in
one
week
time
it
may
assume
its
rightful
title
and
thereafter
the
fame
of
the
copper
princess
will
spread
far
and
wide
but
why
not
let
people
call
the
mine
by
its
real
name
now
papa
what
difference
will
one
week
make
because
replied
ralph
darrell
bending
towards
his
daughter
and
lowering
his
voice
almost
to
a
whisper
as
though
fearful
of
being
overheard
in
one
week
time
only
one
week
from
this
very
day
the
contract
will
expire
and
the
heirs
of
richard
peveril
can
make
no
claim
richard
peveril
cried
the
girl
with
a
sudden
recollection
why
papa
that
is
the
name
of
the
young
man
who
was
in
the
cavern
for
he
told
me
so
himself
he
is
the
same
you
know
who
came
for
your
logs
for
an
instant
the
old
man
glared
at
his
daughter
with
an
expression
so
terrible
that
she
shrank
from
him
frightened
then
it
cleared
and
in
his
ordinary
tone
he
said
gently
i
wish
dear
you
would
go
and
change
your
dress
i
do
like
to
have
you
wear
this
boy
costume
in
the
evening
with
only
a
moment
of
hesitation
the
girl
obeyed
him
and
left
the
room
she
had
no
sooner
disappeared
than
the
strange
expression
that
he
had
so
successfully
banished
for
a
minute
returned
to
the
man
face
and
possessing
himself
of
a
revolver
he
proceeded
to
load
it
as
he
did
so
he
muttered
i
must
do
it
for
her
sake
though
she
must
never
know
richard
peveril
shall
not
be
given
an
opportunity
for
making
his
claim
if
he
is
really
in
the
cavern
he
must
not
be
allowed
to
escape
from
it
alive
so
saying
the
old
man
left
the
room
while
mary
darrell
who
had
been
anxiously
watching
his
movements
through
a
crack
of
the
opposite
doorway
followed
swiftly
after
him
in
the
cavern
at
that
moment
two
groups
of
men
were
confronting
each
other
suspiciously
but
hesitating
as
to
what
attitude
they
should
assume
the
expected
schooner
had
reached
the
coast
that
evening
and
assured
of
safety
by
the
single
light
displayed
from
the
cliffs
had
run
boldly
in
to
her
accustomed
anchorage
as
the
operations
of
the
smugglers
were
necessarily
conducted
with
great
promptness
a
portion
of
her
valuable
cargo
was
immediately
transferred
to
a
small
boat
and
four
men
accompanied
it
to
the
usual
on
the
black
ledge
here
the
goods
were
taken
out
and
two
of
the
men
returned
to
the
schooner
with
the
boat
while
the
others
remained
on
shore
these
became
so
impatient
at
not
receiving
the
usual
intimation
from
above
that
all
was
in
readiness
for
hoisting
nor
any
answer
to
their
repeated
signals
that
they
finally
decided
to
avail
themselves
of
the
tackle
hanging
ready
beside
them
to
go
up
and
investigate
the
captain
of
the
schooner
who
was
an
englishman
went
first
and
the
other
who
was
a
french
canadian
followed
closely
after
him
illustration
a
man
levelled
a
pistol
at
peveril
to
their
amazement
they
found
the
cavern
which
they
had
been
told
was
never
entered
except
by
old
man
darrell
or
his
son
in
possession
of
two
strangers
who
appeared
equally
surprised
at
seeing
them
what
are
you
chaps
doing
demanded
the
englishman
oui
by
gar
vat
you
do
in
zis
place
added
his
follower
i
was
about
to
ask
that
same
question
said
peveril
what
are
doing
here
yes
be
jabers
that
what
want
to
know
what
be
doing
here
chimed
in
mike
connell
at
that
moment
a
figure
suddenly
appeared
on
the
scene
and
with
one
searching
glance
at
peveril
who
stood
fully
revealed
in
the
light
of
mike
connell
lantern
levelled
a
pistol
full
at
him
as
he
did
so
a
cry
of
terror
rang
through
the
chamber
and
a
pair
of
soft
arms
were
flung
about
the
old
man
from
behind
by
this
his
aim
was
so
disconcerted
that
though
the
shot
still
rang
out
with
startling
effect
in
that
confined
space
its
bullet
flew
wide
of
the
intended
mark
and
peveril
stood
unharmed
in
another
second
the
schooner
captain
had
sprung
upon
the
madman
and
wrenched
the
pistol
from
his
hand
crying
out
no
no
darrell
there
must
be
no
murder
connected
with
this
business
it
is
bad
enough
god
knows
without
having
that
added
vrai
certainment
by
gar
shouted
the
canadian
you
bet
your
sweet
life
old
man
that
sort
of
thing
do
go
down
in
the
copper
country
and
it
mighty
lucky
for
you
that
the
young
feller
was
on
hand
to
kape
you
from
carrying
out
your
murderous
intentions
said
mike
connell
sternly
peveril
seeing
that
the
man
whom
he
had
already
recognized
was
rendered
harmless
by
the
loss
of
his
pistol
remained
coolly
silent
waiting
for
some
cue
by
which
his
own
course
of
action
might
be
determined
i
see
i
have
made
a
mistake
gentlemen
said
ralph
darrell
changing
his
tactics
with
all
a
madman
cunning
and
readiness
and
i
beg
mister
a
peveril
said
the
young
man
richard
peveril
is
my
name
sir
yes
of
course
and
as
i
was
saying
i
beg
richard
pardon
for
being
so
hasty
but
my
daughter
here
having
informed
me
of
his
suspicious
presence
in
the
vicinity
of
this
warehouse
i
came
to
protect
my
property
from
possible
depredation
finding
him
in
the
very
place
that
i
was
most
anxious
to
guard
i
very
naturally
took
him
for
a
burglar
and
acted
accordingly
i
am
sorry
of
course
if
i
have
made
a
mistake
but
if
i
remember
rightly
i
have
already
had
occasion
to
accuse
peveril
of
trespassing
and
to
order
him
from
my
premises
you
did
sir
and
i
refused
to
go
until
i
had
recovered
certain
property
to
which
i
have
a
claim
do
you
refuse
to
go
now
when
i
tell
you
that
the
property
in
question
has
been
removed
beyond
your
reach
i
do
not
will
you
promise
never
to
return
i
will
not
will
you
go
with
these
men
on
their
schooner
certainly
not
unless
compelled
by
force
for
i
have
no
inclination
to
trust
myself
with
a
gang
of
smugglers
by
this
time
two
more
of
the
schooner
crew
who
had
reached
the
ledge
with
a
second
of
goods
in
time
to
be
attracted
by
the
in
the
cavern
had
made
their
appearance
on
the
scene
and
stood
wonderingly
behind
their
captain
to
this
individual
the
old
man
whispered
i
will
give
you
one
thousand
dollars
to
capture
this
spy
who
threatens
to
break
up
our
business
carry
him
on
board
your
schooner
and
keep
him
there
for
one
week
one
whole
week
remember
five
hundred
down
and
the
remainder
at
the
end
of
the
week
if
you
have
him
still
on
board
done
said
the
captain
eagerly
and
turning
to
his
men
he
muttered
a
few
words
to
them
in
a
low
tone
peveril
and
connell
watched
this
with
considerable
anxiety
for
they
had
no
idea
what
action
would
be
best
to
take
it
would
be
folly
to
make
an
attack
on
so
strong
a
force
especially
as
they
had
no
direct
provocation
for
so
doing
even
should
they
succeed
in
driving
them
from
the
cavern
they
had
no
clear
idea
of
what
would
be
gained
at
the
same
time
they
did
not
relish
the
idea
of
waiting
quietly
while
the
others
carried
on
their
secret
consultation
the
divils
mean
mischief
mister
peril
whispered
connell
kape
your
eye
on
them
and
mind
if
we
get
separated
in
the
shindy
i
not
the
lad
to
desert
a
friend
look
out
here
they
come
take
that
you
imps
of
satan
with
this
final
exclamation
the
irishman
hurled
his
lighted
lantern
full
into
the
faces
of
the
group
at
that
moment
rushing
towards
them
it
struck
with
a
crash
of
glass
and
then
everything
was
enveloped
in
darkness
the
fight
was
fierce
but
peveril
found
himself
striking
out
wildly
was
conscious
of
delivering
several
telling
blows
and
of
receiving
twice
as
many
in
return
then
he
was
overwhelmed
by
numbers
and
still
fighting
stoutly
was
borne
to
the
rocky
floor
when
all
was
over
and
a
lantern
was
brought
it
revealed
several
bloody
faces
and
blackened
eyes
peveril
was
lying
flat
on
his
back
with
three
men
holding
him
down
connell
had
disappeared
and
so
had
mary
darrell
who
was
still
looked
upon
by
all
present
except
her
father
as
being
a
boy
the
old
man
held
the
lighted
lantern
and
the
captain
of
the
schooner
swearing
savagely
was
holding
his
hands
to
his
face
which
had
been
badly
cut
by
the
irishman
missile
a
cord
was
brought
the
very
one
that
had
lowered
the
and
with
it
peveril
was
trussed
like
a
fowl
for
roasting
then
he
was
swung
down
to
the
ledge
at
the
base
of
the
cliffs
tossed
into
a
boat
and
rowed
away
a
few
minutes
later
he
was
handed
aboard
the
schooner
taken
below
and
chucked
into
a
small
the
door
of
which
was
locked
behind
him
it
was
a
very
unpleasant
position
to
occupy
and
yet
his
thoughts
were
not
dwelling
half
so
much
upon
it
as
they
were
upon
the
fact
that
the
young
person
in
golf
costume
who
had
saved
his
life
that
evening
had
been
spoken
of
as
a
chapter
xxiv
connell
makes
good
his
escape
from
the
very
first
mike
connell
had
determined
not
to
be
captured
if
he
could
possibly
help
it
wisely
concluding
that
he
would
stand
a
better
chance
of
serving
his
friend
in
freedom
than
as
a
prisoner
he
realized
that
ralph
darrell
enmity
was
especially
directed
towards
peveril
and
believed
that
he
therefore
would
be
the
principal
object
of
attack
at
the
same
time
he
knew
that
no
matter
how
desperately
two
might
fight
against
six
there
was
little
hope
of
success
in
face
of
such
overwhelming
odds
so
while
he
was
prepared
to
throw
himself
heart
and
soul
into
the
fray
he
was
also
on
the
watch
for
a
chance
of
escape
the
entrance
of
the
darrell
into
the
cavern
had
been
so
precipitate
and
both
of
them
had
been
so
intent
upon
the
object
of
their
coming
that
they
had
forgotten
their
usual
precaution
and
neglected
to
close
the
door
giving
them
admittance
it
was
a
slab
of
stone
carefully
fitted
to
its
place
swinging
easily
on
iron
pivots
and
usually
fastened
by
a
stout
spring
being
left
open
it
disclosed
a
patch
of
blackness
a
shade
darker
than
the
wall
on
either
side
and
this
caught
connell
eye
just
as
the
rush
was
made
believing
that
here
was
offered
a
chance
of
escape
that
could
be
utilized
better
in
darkness
than
in
light
and
knowing
also
that
a
battle
against
odds
could
be
more
successfully
waged
under
the
same
conditions
he
used
his
lantern
as
a
weapon
of
offence
and
thereby
dashed
out
its
flame
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
fracas
for
a
moment
he
entertained
a
vague
hope
that
he
would
be
able
to
draw
peveril
with
him
into
the
place
that
he
had
discovered
and
that
thus
they
might
effect
an
escape
together
quickly
finding
this
impossible
he
sprang
to
one
side
after
knocking
down
one
of
his
enemies
groped
along
the
wall
until
he
found
the
desired
opening
and
entered
it
as
he
did
so
he
came
in
contact
with
the
slight
figure
of
mary
darrell
who
had
here
taken
refuge
at
the
outbreak
of
the
struggle
and
was
awaiting
its
termination
in
trembling
anxiety
now
thinking
the
to
be
her
father
and
desirous
of
saving
him
from
harm
she
gave
the
stone
door
a
push
that
closed
it
then
she
said
i
am
so
glad
to
have
you
safely
away
from
those
dreadful
men
dear
papa
now
you
will
go
back
with
me
to
the
house
wo
you
for
i
am
afraid
to
go
alone
yes
only
hurry
whispered
the
irishman
readily
accepting
the
situation
but
not
daring
to
speak
aloud
for
fear
of
betraying
his
identity
at
the
same
time
the
thought
what
a
coward
the
young
fellow
is
to
be
sneaking
away
from
an
elegant
shindy
like
the
one
behind
us
i
a
mind
to
give
him
a
taste
of
me
fist
for
luck
when
we
get
out
of
this
black
hole
no
i
will
not
though
i
lave
him
be
for
was
it
him
saved
peril
life
after
all
resting
one
hand
lightly
on
his
guide
shoulder
he
followed
her
closely
and
had
barely
reached
the
foregoing
conclusion
when
the
girl
flung
open
a
door
and
the
two
stepped
into
a
lighted
room
for
a
moment
their
eyes
were
completely
dazzled
by
its
brightness
mary
was
the
first
to
become
accustomed
to
the
glare
of
light
and
turned
to
speak
to
her
supposed
father
upon
seeing
the
face
of
a
perfect
stranger
she
uttered
a
cry
of
dismay
and
started
as
though
to
fly
but
the
other
clutched
her
arm
none
of
that
young
feller
he
said
sternly
now
that
brought
me
so
far
you
see
me
farther
and
show
me
the
way
out
of
here
you
a
fine
bold
chap
ai
you
he
added
in
a
tone
of
scorn
look
like
you
was
fitter
to
be
a
girl
than
a
lad
any
day
and
if
it
was
for
the
good
turn
you
done
me
friend
back
yonder
i
be
tempted
to
give
you
a
kindergarten
lesson
in
the
manly
art
of
as
it
is
i
let
you
off
this
time
provided
show
me
the
way
out
but
you
want
to
get
a
move
on
terribly
frightened
as
she
was
the
girl
still
found
strength
to
open
a
door
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
and
motion
for
the
man
to
pass
through
as
he
did
so
she
slammed
it
behind
him
and
locked
it
then
her
overwrought
feelings
gave
way
and
she
sank
into
a
chair
sobbing
hysterically
furious
at
finding
himself
thus
tricked
the
irishman
first
impulse
was
to
turn
and
batter
down
the
door
but
a
couple
of
heavy
kicks
delivered
against
it
for
this
purpose
brought
forth
a
loud
cry
from
some
lower
region
hi
up
dar
what
you
all
at
the
same
time
it
flashed
into
connell
mind
that
his
recent
enemies
of
the
cavern
might
appear
at
any
moment
and
open
the
door
in
such
a
way
as
to
cause
him
to
regret
that
it
had
not
remained
closed
besides
was
he
not
capable
of
finding
his
own
way
out
of
a
house
of
course
i
am
he
muttered
and
i
best
be
doing
it
in
a
hurry
too
so
young
feller
and
here
hoping
we
meet
again
then
he
made
his
way
opened
a
door
and
found
himself
in
a
kitchen
confronted
by
a
resolute
old
colored
woman
who
after
one
glance
at
his
strange
face
let
fly
at
it
a
ladle
of
hot
water
this
assault
was
immediately
followed
by
such
a
shower
of
plates
pans
and
culinary
utensils
as
caused
the
intruder
to
utter
howls
of
pain
and
make
a
blind
dash
for
an
outer
door
even
outside
the
house
his
troubles
were
far
from
ended
for
shouting
men
were
running
towards
him
through
the
darkness
while
at
the
same
time
a
dog
leaped
at
him
throttling
the
animal
and
flinging
him
off
after
a
vigorous
struggle
connell
had
next
to
knock
down
a
man
who
was
attacking
him
on
the
opposite
side
receive
a
blow
from
a
wielded
by
aunty
nimmo
dodge
several
other
assailants
and
finally
to
run
for
his
life
when
the
poor
fellow
at
length
found
himself
alone
and
safe
from
present
pursuit
he
sat
breathlessly
on
a
log
over
which
he
had
just
pitched
headlong
and
began
to
consider
his
situation
you
may
talk
about
your
dynamite
and
gunpowder
he
said
but
being
blown
up
with
aither
of
them
is
a
patch
to
what
i
gone
through
this
night
what
with
being
wracked
on
a
rock
in
the
sea
fighting
smugglers
nagurs
and
polanders
to
say
nothing
of
dogs
and
other
wild
animals
beat
and
battered
torn
and
scalded
tripped
up
and
lost
in
the
wilderness
and
all
in
the
middle
of
a
cruel
blackness
is
an
experience
that
any
man
might
be
grateful
to
be
done
with
if
i
have
a
whole
bone
left
inside
of
me
skin
or
a
rag
to
me
back
it
more
than
i
hoping
now
what
i
do
next
will
i
go
back
to
the
house
indade
i
will
not
will
i
make
another
try
for
the
cave
not
so
long
as
i
have
me
right
mind
will
i
go
back
to
red
jacket
and
meet
them
as
would
ax
me
what
had
i
done
with
mister
peril
not
on
your
life
where
is
mister
peril
at
this
blessed
minute
anyhow
at
sea
on
board
the
smuggler
or
i
miss
me
guess
how
will
i
get
to
him
by
taking
a
boat
of
course
where
will
i
find
one
at
laughing
fish
cove
to
be
sure
that
the
very
place
bedad
and
the
sooner
i
getting
there
the
better
the
tug
had
reached
laughing
fish
about
an
hour
before
mike
connell
arrived
at
this
decision
she
had
come
in
search
of
the
party
of
that
she
had
brought
to
that
place
more
than
a
week
earlier
and
now
those
on
board
were
greatly
troubled
at
not
finding
a
trace
of
the
missing
men
save
their
deserted
camp
nor
could
they
obtain
any
information
concerning
them
from
the
fisher
folk
of
the
cove
on
board
the
tug
was
major
arkell
who
had
been
led
by
curiosity
to
take
the
trip
he
was
curious
to
know
what
had
become
of
the
young
man
whom
he
had
sent
into
that
region
to
pick
up
wrecked
logs
and
he
was
also
curious
to
ascertain
what
had
become
of
a
large
number
of
those
same
logs
that
still
remained
unaccounted
for
at
the
same
time
he
would
like
to
investigate
certain
reports
that
had
reached
him
of
the
reopening
of
some
old
in
that
neighborhood
he
had
hoped
that
his
researches
might
not
take
him
beyond
laughing
fish
where
he
anticipated
finding
richard
peveril
prepared
to
answer
all
his
questions
failing
to
discover
the
young
man
or
any
trace
of
him
the
problems
that
he
had
set
out
to
solve
became
more
interesting
than
before
and
he
ordered
captain
spillins
to
start
at
daybreak
on
a
cruise
still
farther
up
the
coast
early
on
the
following
morning
therefore
everything
was
in
readiness
on
board
the
tug
and
its
crew
were
getting
up
the
anchor
when
their
attention
was
arrested
by
the
shouts
and
gesticulations
of
a
man
on
the
beach
send
a
boat
in
and
see
what
he
wants
said
the
manager
and
ten
minutes
later
mike
connell
was
on
board
telling
his
story
to
a
highly
interested
group
of
listeners
within
an
hour
after
receiving
her
new
passenger
the
under
full
head
of
steam
was
several
miles
to
the
northward
of
laughing
fish
and
well
out
to
sea
in
hot
pursuit
of
a
small
schooner
the
latter
was
slipping
easily
along
before
the
fresh
morning
breeze
that
had
recently
set
in
after
a
night
of
calm
the
water
rippled
merrily
past
her
flashing
sides
and
she
was
making
some
six
miles
an
hour
at
the
same
time
the
pouring
forth
great
clouds
of
smoke
and
heaping
the
smooth
water
into
double
billows
as
she
rushed
through
it
was
doing
two
miles
to
her
one
and
would
soon
overtake
her
whatever
can
that
bloomin
teakettle
want
of
us
growled
the
captain
of
the
schooner
as
he
blinked
with
eyes
at
his
pursuer
she
ai
no
revenue
boat
as
i
can
see
tom
our
ensign
as
a
hint
for
to
keep
away
the
sailor
obeyed
and
a
minute
later
ran
the
crimson
flag
of
great
britain
to
the
main
peak
where
it
streamed
out
bravely
in
the
freshening
breeze
got
a
flag
aboard
this
boat
captain
spillins
asked
major
arkell
as
he
watched
the
schooner
from
the
yes
sir
two
of
good
we
see
that
fellow
and
go
him
one
better
set
both
in
consequence
of
this
order
the
stars
and
stripes
were
quickly
snapping
defiantly
from
both
the
forward
and
after
of
the
tug
sheer
off
blast
you
or
you
run
us
down
bellowed
the
captain
of
the
schooner
as
the
tug
ranged
close
abreast
is
that
your
man
asked
the
manager
of
mike
connell
he
is
sure
i
know
him
from
a
thousand
by
me
own
frescos
on
his
purty
face
have
you
a
man
named
richard
peveril
aboard
your
craft
demanded
captain
spillins
none
of
your
d
d
business
run
him
down
ordered
major
arkell
sternly
and
the
words
had
hardly
left
his
mouth
before
the
two
vessels
came
together
with
a
crash
chapter
xxv
a
on
lake
superior
as
no
other
schooner
was
in
sight
and
as
this
one
was
standing
off
the
coast
when
discovered
the
people
had
from
the
very
first
believed
her
to
be
the
one
they
wanted
her
hoisting
of
british
colors
strengthened
this
belief
and
it
was
finally
confirmed
by
connell
recognition
of
her
captain
until
that
moment
however
they
had
entertained
serious
doubts
as
to
whether
they
should
find
peveril
on
board
for
it
did
not
seem
credible
that
even
a
smuggler
accustomed
to
running
great
risks
would
dare
abduct
and
forcibly
carry
off
an
american
citizen
they
did
not
know
of
the
tempting
reward
promised
to
the
schooner
captain
for
doing
that
very
thing
nor
of
his
determination
to
make
this
his
last
voyage
on
the
great
lake
so
they
anxiously
awaited
his
answer
to
the
question
have
you
a
man
named
richard
peveril
aboard
your
craft
when
it
came
although
it
was
neither
yes
nor
no
it
so
thoroughly
confirmed
their
suspicions
that
they
had
no
hesitation
in
attempting
to
rescue
their
friend
by
force
and
the
men
gave
a
yell
of
delight
as
the
two
vessels
crashed
together
on
board
the
tug
this
moment
had
been
foreseen
and
prepared
for
two
small
anchors
had
been
got
ready
to
serve
as
and
each
man
had
been
told
off
for
special
duty
the
regular
crew
of
four
men
had
been
materially
strengthened
by
the
addition
of
the
two
passengers
but
as
the
engineer
must
be
left
on
board
under
all
circumstances
the
available
fighting
force
was
reduced
to
five
as
it
happened
this
was
the
exact
number
on
board
the
schooner
so
as
the
scrambled
to
her
deck
each
singled
out
an
individual
and
went
for
him
the
vessel
had
been
thrown
into
the
wind
by
the
collision
her
sails
were
thrashing
to
and
fro
with
a
tremendous
clatter
which
combined
with
a
roar
of
escaping
steam
from
the
tug
created
such
dire
confusion
among
the
smugglers
as
rendered
them
almost
incapable
of
resistance
in
fact
their
captain
was
the
only
one
who
made
a
show
of
fighting
and
springing
at
him
with
a
howl
of
delight
mike
connell
sent
him
sprawling
to
the
deck
with
a
single
blow
then
the
irishman
dove
down
the
companionway
cast
a
hasty
glance
about
the
little
cabin
and
made
for
the
only
door
in
sight
a
couple
of
vigorous
kicks
burst
it
open
and
in
another
minute
richard
peveril
was
again
a
free
man
as
the
two
friends
reached
the
deck
connell
uttered
a
wild
irish
yell
of
triumph
while
the
released
captive
who
now
gained
his
first
inkling
of
what
had
taken
place
stared
about
him
in
bewilderment
then
he
burst
into
a
shout
of
laughter
at
the
spectacle
of
four
men
one
of
whom
was
the
dignified
manager
of
the
great
white
pine
mining
company
calmly
sitting
on
the
prostrate
bodies
of
four
others
while
a
fifth
who
had
just
struggled
to
his
feet
with
a
very
rueful
countenance
suddenly
dropped
to
the
deck
again
as
he
caught
sight
of
connell
greeting
peveril
with
a
hearty
cheer
and
carrying
him
with
them
the
regained
their
ship
and
cast
off
the
lines
that
held
her
to
the
schooner
as
these
were
loosed
her
rang
merrily
her
screw
churned
the
dimpled
waters
into
a
yeasty
foam
and
with
a
derisive
farewell
yell
from
her
exultant
crew
she
dashed
away
leaving
her
recent
antagonist
enveloped
in
a
cloud
of
sulphurous
smoke
the
whole
affair
had
occupied
just
five
minutes
there
was
no
lack
of
entertainment
on
board
the
good
tug
as
she
again
headed
southward
and
ploughed
her
way
briskly
towards
laughing
fish
for
every
one
had
thrilling
stories
to
tell
or
to
hear
it
seems
to
me
remarked
major
arkell
to
peveril
after
listening
attentively
to
the
young
man
narration
that
you
have
managed
to
compress
a
greater
number
of
desperate
adventures
and
escapes
into
a
short
space
of
time
than
any
other
man
in
the
copper
country
i
for
instance
have
been
here
for
ten
years
and
yet
had
an
adventure
worth
the
telling
not
even
the
one
of
this
morning
oh
that
was
only
an
incident
compared
with
what
has
happened
to
you
how
do
you
manage
it
do
you
always
find
such
stirring
times
wherever
you
go
no
indeed
laughed
peveril
until
very
recently
i
have
led
a
most
quiet
and
uneventful
life
even
now
i
would
gladly
exchange
all
my
adventures
as
you
are
pleased
to
call
them
for
the
smallest
scrap
of
information
regarding
the
mine
that
i
came
out
here
to
find
have
you
learned
anything
concerning
your
copper
princess
yet
not
one
word
that
strange
i
wonder
if
it
can
be
located
in
the
ontonagon
region
i
had
just
about
made
up
my
mind
to
visit
that
section
and
find
out
replied
peveril
that
is
if
i
have
earned
enough
money
while
working
for
you
to
pay
my
travelling
expenses
i
guess
you
have
laughed
the
major
but
i
ca
let
you
go
yet
a
while
for
i
shall
want
you
to
help
me
settle
accounts
with
that
old
fellow
who
stole
our
logs
besides
you
have
so
aroused
my
curiosity
regarding
those
prehistoric
workings
of
yours
that
i
should
like
very
much
to
visit
them
do
you
think
you
could
find
the
entrance
again
which
entrance
the
hole
down
which
i
was
thrown
or
the
one
through
which
i
crawled
out
the
one
by
which
you
were
introduced
to
them
of
course
from
your
own
account
the
other
is
altogether
too
small
for
comfort
and
the
chances
of
being
shot
for
trespass
are
altogether
too
great
in
its
vicinity
i
expect
i
could
find
the
locality
but
i
hate
the
idea
of
ever
going
near
it
again
i
do
think
you
can
imagine
what
i
suffered
while
down
there
i
am
sure
the
place
will
haunt
my
worst
dreams
during
the
remainder
of
my
life
by
going
down
again
with
plenty
of
light
company
and
an
assured
means
at
leaving
at
any
moment
the
place
will
present
a
very
different
and
much
more
cheerful
aspect
besides
the
ancient
tools
that
you
mention
as
existing
in
such
numbers
down
there
are
becoming
so
scarce
as
to
be
very
valuable
and
well
worth
collecting
so
on
the
whole
i
think
we
had
better
go
and
take
a
look
at
your
prehistoric
diggings
this
very
day
very
well
sir
since
you
insist
upon
it
i
will
act
as
your
guide
but
i
must
confess
that
i
shall
be
heartily
glad
to
leave
this
part
of
the
country
and
return
to
the
civilization
of
red
jacket
civilization
of
red
jacket
is
good
laughed
the
other
how
long
since
you
considered
it
as
civilized
ever
since
i
left
there
and
found
out
how
much
worse
other
places
could
be
as
a
result
of
this
conversation
four
men
left
laughing
fish
soon
after
the
tug
again
dropped
anchor
in
its
cove
and
took
to
the
trail
that
two
of
them
had
followed
before
these
two
were
peveril
and
connell
the
others
were
the
white
pine
manager
and
captain
spillins
arrived
at
the
point
from
which
darrell
folly
could
be
seen
they
turned
abruptly
to
the
right
and
plunged
into
the
woods
only
too
well
did
peveril
remember
the
path
over
which
he
had
been
dragged
a
helpless
captive
only
three
days
before
but
the
way
seemed
shorter
now
than
then
and
he
was
surprised
to
discover
the
dreaded
shaft
within
a
few
hundred
feet
of
the
trail
they
had
just
left
they
had
brought
ropes
with
them
as
well
as
an
axe
and
candles
in
abundance
now
after
cutting
away
the
bushes
from
the
and
measuring
its
depth
by
letting
down
a
lighted
candle
until
it
was
extinguished
in
the
water
at
the
bottom
they
prepared
for
the
descent
the
major
was
to
go
first
and
peveril
whose
dread
of
the
undertaking
had
been
partially
overcome
was
to
follow
the
others
were
to
remain
on
the
surface
to
pull
their
companions
up
when
their
explorations
should
be
finished
so
major
arkell
seated
himself
in
a
loop
of
the
rope
swung
over
the
edge
of
the
old
shaft
and
was
slowly
lowered
until
the
measured
length
had
run
out
then
the
others
peering
anxiously
down
from
above
saw
his
twinkling
light
swing
back
and
forth
until
it
suddenly
disappeared
a
moment
later
the
rope
was
relieved
of
its
strain
and
they
knew
that
its
burden
had
been
safely
deposited
on
the
rocky
platform
described
by
peveril
he
went
next
and
was
quickly
landed
in
safety
beside
his
companion
it
is
an
old
working
sure
as
you
live
exclaimed
the
major
who
was
examining
the
walls
of
the
gallery
with
a
professional
eye
and
here
are
the
tools
you
spoke
of
beautiful
specimens
by
jove
finest
i
ever
saw
we
must
have
them
all
up
every
one
but
let
us
go
back
a
piece
and
examine
the
drift
first
time
i
ever
knew
of
those
old
fellows
drifting
though
they
generally
only
worked
in
open
pits
until
they
struck
water
and
then
quit
did
seem
to
have
any
idea
of
pumps
still
filled
with
his
recent
horror
of
the
place
peveril
tried
to
dissuade
the
other
from
penetrating
any
farther
into
the
workings
but
in
vain
and
so
each
bearing
a
lighted
candle
they
set
forth
at
the
several
piles
of
material
previously
noted
as
barring
the
way
the
major
uttered
exclamations
of
delight
and
astonishment
it
is
copper
he
cried
mass
copper
almost
pure
the
very
richest
specimens
i
have
ever
seen
why
man
the
old
mine
must
have
been
a
bonanza
if
it
all
panned
out
stuff
like
this
these
piles
were
evidently
ready
for
removal
when
something
interfered
to
prevent
wonder
what
it
could
have
been
did
find
any
bones
did
you
or
evidences
of
a
catastrophe
no
nothing
but
what
you
see
good
heavens
major
what
that
with
blanched
faces
the
two
stood
and
listened
strong
men
as
they
were
their
very
limbs
trembled
while
their
hearts
almost
ceased
beating
again
it
came
from
the
black
depths
beyond
them
a
cry
of
agony
pitiful
and
pleading
let
get
out
of
this
whispered
the
major
clutching
at
arm
and
endeavoring
to
drag
him
back
the
way
they
had
come
i
had
enough
no
replied
the
other
resolutely
we
ca
leave
while
some
human
being
is
calling
for
deliverance
from
this
awful
place
illustration
the
two
men
stood
and
listened
you
do
think
it
a
human
voice
i
do
and
at
any
rate
i
am
going
to
see
there
hear
it
again
came
the
shrill
cry
echoing
from
the
rocky
walls
help
for
god
sake
do
leave
us
here
to
perish
at
the
sound
peveril
sprang
forward
and
the
major
tremblingly
followed
him
back
in
the
gloom
a
hundred
yards
from
where
they
had
halted
they
came
upon
a
scene
that
neither
will
ever
forget
so
long
as
he
lives
a
slender
youth
and
a
man
stood
clinging
to
each
other
and
gazing
with
wildly
incredulous
eyes
at
the
advancing
lights
it
is
richard
peveril
father
oh
thank
god
thank
god
sir
that
you
have
come
in
time
cried
the
younger
of
the
two
richard
peveril
repeated
the
old
man
huskily
no
no
mary
it
ca
be
it
must
not
be
richard
peveril
is
dead
and
the
contract
is
void
he
has
no
claim
on
the
copper
princess
it
is
all
mine
mine
and
yours
but
do
let
him
know
keep
the
secret
for
one
week
longer
only
one
little
week
then
you
may
tell
it
to
the
world
chapter
xxvi
first
news
of
the
copper
princess
when
peveril
made
his
miraculous
escape
from
the
old
mine
he
left
his
place
of
exit
open
in
his
impatience
to
get
away
from
the
scene
of
his
sufferings
he
had
not
even
given
another
thought
to
the
great
stone
slab
that
he
had
raised
with
such
difficulty
and
precariously
propped
into
position
by
a
few
fragments
of
rock
so
the
narrow
passage
leading
down
from
the
cavern
into
the
ancient
workings
that
had
been
so
carefully
concealed
for
centuries
was
at
length
open
to
the
inspection
of
any
who
should
happen
that
way
thus
it
remained
during
the
day
of
exciting
incidents
in
the
cavern
and
through
the
struggle
that
was
ended
by
the
smugglers
bearing
peveril
away
captive
to
their
schooner
having
thus
disposed
of
the
person
whom
of
all
in
the
world
he
most
dreaded
and
placed
him
where
it
was
apparently
impossible
for
him
to
make
a
claim
on
the
copper
princess
before
the
expiration
of
the
term
of
contract
ralph
darrell
rejoined
his
daughter
she
noting
his
excitement
and
fearing
to
increase
it
made
no
mention
of
her
own
encounter
with
the
other
stranger
whose
presence
in
the
cavern
seemed
to
have
escaped
her
father
notice
so
they
only
talked
of
peveril
and
the
girl
picturing
him
as
he
had
appeared
on
the
several
occasions
of
their
meeting
wondered
if
he
could
really
be
trying
to
rob
them
of
their
slender
possessions
as
her
father
claimed
the
latter
talked
so
incoherently
of
a
conspiracy
a
contract
and
of
the
great
wealth
that
would
be
theirs
in
one
week
from
that
time
that
she
was
completely
bewildered
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
began
to
wonder
if
her
papa
knew
exactly
what
he
was
saying
thus
thinking
she
soothed
him
as
best
she
could
and
finally
succeeded
in
getting
him
off
to
bed
but
in
the
morning
the
subject
was
again
uppermost
in
his
mind
and
he
would
talk
of
nothing
else
now
he
wondered
how
peveril
could
have
found
his
way
into
the
cavern
and
as
mary
was
also
very
curious
on
that
point
she
willingly
accompanied
him
on
a
tour
of
investigation
in
this
search
it
was
not
long
before
they
discovered
the
upraised
stone
slab
at
the
rear
end
of
the
cavern
and
peered
curiously
into
the
black
passage
beneath
it
which
from
the
very
first
ralph
darrell
was
determined
to
explore
it
is
a
part
of
our
own
mine
he
said
and
so
i
must
find
out
all
about
it
there
is
no
danger
for
i
can
go
very
carefully
and
return
when
i
please
i
must
go
though
for
it
is
clearly
my
duty
to
do
so
who
knows
but
what
i
may
strike
another
vein
down
there
as
valuable
as
the
one
we
are
already
working
so
dear
do
you
wait
here
and
i
will
come
back
to
you
very
shortly
but
brave
mary
darrell
would
not
agree
to
any
such
proposition
and
declared
that
if
her
father
insisted
on
going
into
that
horrid
place
she
should
follow
him
so
the
old
man
and
the
girl
the
former
filled
with
eager
curiosity
and
the
latter
with
a
premonition
of
danger
crept
under
the
great
slab
and
entered
the
sloping
passage
they
had
but
a
single
candle
with
them
and
of
this
mary
was
glad
for
she
knew
it
would
limit
their
exploration
and
compel
a
speedy
return
both
of
them
being
of
much
slighter
frame
than
peveril
they
found
little
difficulty
in
slipping
through
the
passage
and
reaching
the
ancient
workings
to
which
it
led
here
darrell
began
to
find
copper
and
went
into
ecstasies
over
its
richness
forgetful
of
everything
else
he
pushed
eagerly
forward
from
one
pile
of
the
valuable
metal
to
another
and
mary
inspired
by
his
enthusiasm
almost
forgot
her
dread
of
the
gloomy
place
in
which
so
much
wealth
was
stored
so
absorbed
were
they
that
neither
of
them
paid
any
attention
to
a
dull
sound
as
of
some
heavy
body
falling
that
came
from
a
distance
finally
their
candle
burning
low
warned
them
to
hasten
their
return
but
to
their
consternation
when
they
again
reached
the
end
of
the
passage
they
found
its
entrance
closed
the
great
slab
insecurely
supported
had
fallen
into
place
and
the
utmost
exertion
of
their
feeble
strength
was
insufficient
to
move
it
as
they
realized
the
full
extent
of
the
disaster
that
had
thus
befallen
them
the
girl
was
awed
into
a
despairing
silence
while
the
old
man
impaired
intellect
gave
way
completely
beneath
the
awful
strain
of
the
situation
and
he
broke
into
incoherent
ravings
at
length
mary
darrell
knew
that
her
beloved
father
had
lost
his
mind
and
that
she
must
share
her
living
tomb
with
a
madman
in
his
ravings
he
declared
that
the
situation
was
exactly
as
he
wanted
it
for
now
no
one
not
even
richard
peveril
himself
could
share
their
wealth
with
the
next
breath
he
expressed
an
intention
of
getting
back
to
the
piles
of
copper
as
quickly
as
possible
that
he
might
defend
them
with
his
life
against
all
claimants
terrible
as
it
was
to
the
girl
to
hear
her
father
talk
in
this
way
his
mention
of
peveril
brought
a
faint
ray
of
hope
if
the
young
man
had
indeed
gained
access
to
the
cavern
from
this
direction
then
the
old
workings
must
possess
some
other
exit
if
they
could
only
discover
such
a
place
it
was
barely
possible
that
they
might
still
escape
thus
thinking
she
humored
her
father
desire
to
return
to
the
piles
of
copper
and
even
hastened
his
steps
in
that
direction
for
their
candle
was
burning
perilously
low
so
nearly
had
it
expired
that
they
had
hardly
regained
the
old
workings
before
its
feeble
flame
gave
a
final
flicker
and
they
were
plunged
into
blackness
through
this
they
still
groped
their
way
until
the
old
man
strength
was
exhausted
and
he
refused
to
go
farther
then
clinging
to
him
in
an
agony
of
despair
the
poor
girl
closed
her
eyes
and
prayed
dear
christ
help
me
in
this
time
of
my
bitter
trouble
for
i
have
no
strength
save
in
thee
her
cry
was
heard
and
her
prayer
was
answered
even
as
it
was
uttered
for
with
the
opening
of
her
eyes
she
caught
a
gleam
of
light
a
minute
later
when
richard
peveril
came
to
her
he
seemed
like
one
sent
from
heaven
and
at
that
moment
she
could
have
worshipped
him
peveril
heart
leaped
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
and
he
received
two
other
distinct
thrills
of
delight
from
her
father
incoherent
words
one
was
when
he
addressed
the
slight
figure
at
his
side
as
mary
and
the
other
was
caused
by
his
mention
of
the
copper
princess
by
the
first
peveril
recently
aroused
suspicion
concerning
the
sex
of
the
wearer
of
that
golf
costume
was
reduced
to
a
certainty
while
by
the
other
he
gained
his
first
clue
to
the
mine
of
which
he
was
in
search
at
the
moment
however
these
things
merely
flashed
through
his
mind
for
he
realized
that
the
present
was
neither
the
time
nor
the
place
to
discuss
them
the
two
helpless
ones
so
wonderfully
intrusted
to
his
care
must
be
removed
at
once
from
the
place
in
which
they
had
suffered
so
keenly
both
he
and
the
major
agreed
that
it
would
be
best
to
take
them
out
by
way
of
the
shaft
and
though
they
were
full
of
curiosity
as
to
how
the
darrells
came
into
their
distressing
position
both
manfully
refrained
from
asking
questions
until
they
had
escorted
them
to
the
entrance
for
this
forbearance
the
major
deserved
even
greater
credit
than
his
young
friend
for
as
yet
he
had
no
knowledge
of
who
the
strangers
were
nor
how
it
happened
that
they
seemed
to
know
peveril
illustration
rescued
from
the
shaft
arrived
at
the
shaft
it
was
decided
that
the
major
should
ascend
first
to
prepare
those
at
the
top
for
what
was
coming
as
well
as
to
receive
the
old
man
who
would
be
sent
up
next
as
he
adjusted
the
rope
about
his
body
he
whispered
to
peveril
who
was
assisting
him
who
are
they
darrells
was
the
laconic
answer
not
old
man
darrell
of
the
yes
and
his
daughter
i
believe
so
replied
the
young
man
at
the
same
time
wondering
how
the
other
had
discovered
so
quickly
the
rightful
sex
of
the
apparent
lad
but
how
on
earth
do
they
happen
to
know
you
they
ought
to
seeing
that
the
old
man
has
shot
at
me
twice
while
miss
darrell
and
i
have
met
several
times
and
on
one
occasion
at
least
she
saved
my
life
whew
no
wonder
you
greet
each
other
like
old
friends
rejoined
the
major
as
he
swung
off
over
the
black
pool
and
began
slowly
to
ascend
the
ancient
shaft
when
the
rope
was
again
lowered
it
brought
some
bits
of
stout
cord
for
which
peveril
had
asked
and
with
these
he
fastened
the
old
man
so
securely
into
the
loop
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
his
falling
out
although
ralph
darrell
was
still
highly
excited
and
talked
constantly
he
readily
agreed
to
every
proposition
made
by
his
daughter
and
offered
no
objection
to
going
up
the
shaft
as
he
swung
out
from
the
platform
and
those
above
began
to
hoist
on
the
rope
his
daughter
bent
anxiously
forward
to
note
his
progress
apparently
unconscious
of
her
own
danger
she
leaned
out
farther
and
farther
until
peveril
fearful
lest
she
should
lose
her
balance
and
plunge
into
the
pool
reached
an
arm
about
her
waist
and
held
her
the
girl
was
so
intent
upon
watching
her
father
that
for
a
moment
she
paid
no
attention
to
this
then
suddenly
becoming
conscious
of
the
strong
support
against
which
she
was
leaning
she
stepped
quickly
back
to
a
position
of
safety
i
did
suppose
you
would
think
it
necessary
to
take
such
care
of
a
boy
she
said
with
an
attempt
at
dignity
i
should
laughed
peveril
but
why
did
you
tell
me
yesterday
that
you
were
a
young
lady
and
that
your
name
was
mary
i
do
remember
that
you
asked
me
that
so
it
was
you
who
asked
all
the
questions
and
i
who
answered
them
so
now
it
is
my
turn
i
promise
to
answer
though
oh
but
you
must
for
there
are
some
things
that
i
am
extremely
anxious
to
know
for
instance
why
do
you
dress
in
boy
costume
because
my
father
wished
me
to
an
excellent
reason
now
i
want
to
know
if
folly
and
the
copper
princess
are
one
and
the
same
mine
i
believe
the
copper
princess
has
been
called
by
that
other
name
which
however
i
will
thank
you
not
to
repeat
in
my
presence
all
right
i
wo
but
tell
me
here
is
the
rope
peveril
and
thanking
you
over
and
over
again
for
your
very
great
kindness
i
will
bid
you
said
the
girl
hurriedly
adjusting
the
loop
and
preparing
to
ascend
there
was
never
a
more
amazed
or
abashed
man
in
this
world
than
was
mike
connell
when
the
young
lady
whom
he
full
of
curiosity
was
helping
to
hoist
from
the
old
shaft
made
her
appearance
and
he
discovered
her
to
be
the
lad
whom
he
had
treated
with
such
freedom
the
evening
before
he
was
so
staggered
that
he
could
not
utter
a
word
but
simply
stared
at
her
with
an
expression
in
which
mortification
and
admiration
were
equally
blended
the
moment
the
girl
gained
a
footing
on
the
surface
she
made
a
comprehensive
little
bow
to
the
men
assembled
about
the
and
said
my
father
and
i
thank
you
gentlemen
from
overflowing
hearts
for
your
great
kindness
to
us
and
shall
hope
to
see
you
at
our
home
for
supper
after
you
have
been
rejoined
by
peveril
come
papa
let
us
go
and
make
ready
for
company
with
this
she
led
the
old
man
away
in
the
direction
of
his
folly
half
an
hour
later
the
four
men
from
white
pine
were
received
at
the
door
of
the
darrell
house
by
a
dignified
young
lady
simply
but
becomingly
dressed
in
the
usual
costume
of
her
sex
looking
directly
at
one
of
them
she
said
i
bid
you
welcome
peveril
to
your
own
copper
princess
chapter
xxvii
a
night
with
a
madman
when
left
alone
at
the
bottom
of
the
ancient
shaft
with
the
impenetrable
gloom
of
the
prehistoric
workings
crowding
him
close
peveril
had
found
a
few
minutes
in
which
to
reflect
upon
the
strange
happenings
of
the
past
darrell
folly
was
the
copper
princess
the
mine
in
which
he
owned
a
the
one
for
which
he
had
searched
so
long
and
had
almost
given
up
hopes
of
finding
was
it
of
any
value
or
did
the
name
applied
in
derision
rightly
describe
it
and
the
old
man
who
had
twice
attempted
to
take
his
life
whom
he
had
just
rescued
from
a
living
tomb
was
his
partner
how
could
they
ever
work
harmoniously
together
he
certainly
should
not
agree
to
the
carrying
on
of
further
smuggling
operations
and
so
there
was
a
barrier
to
their
amicable
relations
at
the
very
outset
but
was
that
man
the
person
with
whom
he
would
have
to
deal
after
all
he
was
evidently
crazy
and
probably
had
been
from
the
very
first
for
peveril
now
remembered
that
ketchum
had
hinted
at
something
of
the
kind
during
their
last
interview
as
a
crazy
man
could
not
legally
transact
business
his
dealings
would
then
be
with
ralph
darrell
heirs
or
legal
representatives
who
were
those
heirs
were
there
any
other
besides
this
daughter
mary
he
hoped
not
what
a
brave
splendid
girl
she
was
and
how
pleasant
it
would
be
to
discuss
business
plans
with
her
how
absurd
of
him
not
to
have
recognized
her
at
once
even
in
her
boyish
costume
and
how
stupid
she
must
think
him
he
wished
those
fellows
up
above
had
not
been
in
such
a
hurry
with
that
rope
for
there
were
a
lot
more
questions
he
wanted
to
ask
her
so
many
that
he
would
not
have
objected
if
he
and
she
had
been
left
down
there
together
ever
so
much
longer
how
different
the
old
mine
seemed
now
to
what
it
had
when
he
first
knew
it
hereafter
it
would
always
be
associated
in
his
mind
with
memories
of
a
slight
figure
that
he
had
been
permitted
to
hold
for
a
single
minute
a
flushed
face
a
pair
of
glorious
eyes
and
a
voice
that
he
should
never
forget
how
shy
she
was
and
at
the
same
time
how
dignified
how
sweet
and
womanly
in
her
anxiety
about
her
father
he
hoped
they
could
be
friends
as
all
business
partners
should
be
of
course
they
could
never
be
anything
more
than
that
for
he
was
not
forgetting
his
obligation
to
rose
oh
no
not
for
one
minute
how
infernally
slow
those
chaps
up
above
were
now
and
why
did
they
let
down
the
rope
were
they
going
to
keep
him
waiting
in
that
beastly
hole
forever
it
really
seemed
so
by
a
simple
process
of
reasoning
and
the
putting
together
of
the
various
bits
of
information
gained
from
her
father
mary
darrell
had
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
young
man
whose
fortunes
had
been
so
strangely
interwoven
with
hers
during
the
past
ten
days
was
the
rightful
owner
of
the
mine
that
her
father
had
claimed
for
so
many
years
she
was
too
loyal
to
the
latter
to
believe
for
a
moment
that
he
had
consciously
attempted
to
defraud
peveril
of
his
rights
but
credited
all
his
actions
to
the
sad
mental
condition
of
which
she
had
only
now
become
aware
poor
dear
papa
she
said
to
herself
he
has
done
splendidly
to
take
care
of
me
for
so
long
as
he
has
and
now
i
will
take
care
of
him
we
will
go
away
from
this
horrid
place
where
he
gets
so
excited
and
find
some
little
home
in
the
east
where
he
can
rest
until
his
mind
is
wholly
restored
in
the
meantime
this
peveril
can
have
the
old
mine
to
do
with
as
he
pleases
i
shall
let
him
know
that
we
consider
it
his
property
before
he
has
a
chance
to
even
make
a
claim
against
it
i
must
let
him
see
for
a
moment
how
badly
we
feel
about
it
though
for
he
seems
very
nice
and
has
certainly
placed
us
under
a
great
obligation
by
coming
to
our
rescue
so
splendidly
i
wonder
how
he
knew
that
papa
and
i
were
down
in
that
awful
place
having
got
her
father
to
his
room
told
aunty
nimmo
to
prepare
for
company
and
hurriedly
changed
her
dress
mary
darrell
greeted
the
expected
guests
according
to
her
privately
arranged
programme
and
invited
them
in
to
supper
after
seeing
them
seated
at
the
table
and
provided
with
a
bountiful
meal
she
left
them
on
the
plea
that
her
father
needed
her
attention
the
girl
had
not
been
gone
many
minutes
and
peveril
friends
were
still
congratulating
him
upon
having
come
into
his
fortune
at
the
same
time
speculating
whether
the
folly
was
worth
anything
or
not
when
she
the
room
with
a
frightened
expression
on
her
face
addressing
herself
to
major
arkell
she
said
would
you
mind
coming
up
to
see
my
father
sir
i
fear
he
is
very
the
major
at
once
complied
with
this
request
and
after
he
had
gone
captain
spillins
said
i
should
wonder
if
the
old
fellow
played
out
and
left
you
in
sole
possession
of
the
princess
after
all
mr
peveril
which
princess
are
you
meanin
captain
asked
mike
connell
sure
it
seems
to
me
there
two
of
them
have
a
care
connell
said
peveril
warningly
remember
the
circumstances
under
which
we
are
here
i
beg
your
pardon
mister
peril
exclaimed
the
irishman
contritely
i
near
forgot
that
you
was
already
bespoke
a
hot
flush
sprang
to
the
young
man
cheek
but
ere
he
could
frame
a
reply
major
arkell
reappeared
looking
greatly
worried
boys
he
said
we
a
very
serious
case
on
our
hands
and
one
that
demands
immediate
action
the
old
man
is
fairly
out
of
his
head
besides
being
in
a
high
fever
he
needs
medical
attendance
as
quickly
as
it
can
be
got
to
him
and
careful
nursing
i
have
given
him
an
opiate
which
i
hope
will
keep
him
quiet
for
a
while
and
now
i
propose
to
go
to
red
jacket
in
the
tug
for
a
doctor
and
a
nurse
captain
spillins
will
of
course
go
with
me
and
we
shall
try
to
be
back
by
morning
in
the
meantime
the
poor
young
lady
must
not
be
left
alone
or
with
only
that
old
aunty
who
is
nearly
frightened
out
of
her
wits
and
so
i
think
you
peveril
ought
to
stay
here
with
connell
and
do
what
you
can
you
are
in
a
sense
the
proprietor
here
you
know
and
as
connell
has
also
been
here
before
maybe
the
old
man
will
be
more
reasonable
with
you
than
he
would
be
with
entire
strangers
i
quite
agree
with
you
that
some
of
us
ought
to
stay
here
and
do
what
we
can
said
peveril
and
under
the
circumstances
i
suppose
connell
and
i
are
the
ones
to
do
so
at
the
same
time
i
have
had
much
experience
in
caring
for
madmen
no
more
have
i
said
connell
but
i
do
me
best
for
sake
of
the
young
lady
and
maybe
she
forgive
me
for
treating
her
the
same
as
i
would
a
lad
and
major
added
peveril
if
you
will
kindly
fetch
my
luggage
from
the
trefethen
i
shall
be
greatly
obliged
so
the
party
separated
and
while
two
of
them
wended
their
way
back
to
the
tug
at
laughing
fish
the
others
prepared
for
the
long
vigil
of
the
night
after
the
effect
of
the
opiate
had
passed
their
patient
was
seized
with
paroxysms
of
raving
and
frantic
efforts
to
leave
his
bed
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
his
property
at
such
times
it
required
the
united
efforts
of
the
two
volunteer
nurses
to
restrain
him
and
after
each
attack
he
was
left
weak
and
helpless
as
an
infant
then
he
would
weep
and
beg
piteously
not
to
be
abandoned
to
the
mercy
of
his
enemies
or
he
would
fancy
himself
still
in
the
awful
blackness
of
the
ancient
workings
and
plead
with
his
attendants
not
to
be
left
thereto
die
for
the
sake
of
my
daughter
gentlemen
my
only
child
who
has
no
one
else
in
the
world
to
love
her
or
care
for
her
i
beg
of
you
to
save
me
if
you
are
human
take
pity
on
her
and
let
me
go
he
would
cry
at
such
times
no
voice
not
even
mary
seemed
to
soothe
him
as
did
that
of
peveril
and
his
most
violent
struggles
were
controlled
by
the
gentle
firmness
of
the
young
athlete
all
through
that
dreadful
night
mary
darrell
watched
peveril
with
eyes
wondering
at
his
strength
and
gentleness
and
unconsciously
loving
him
for
them
not
that
she
would
for
an
instant
have
admitted
such
a
thing
even
to
herself
she
tried
instead
to
believe
that
he
was
the
cause
of
all
this
sorrow
and
that
she
hated
him
for
it
in
whatever
he
does
she
said
to
herself
he
is
actuated
by
remorse
and
a
desire
to
atone
in
some
way
for
ruining
my
father
life
the
anxiously
awaited
dawn
found
ralph
darrell
lying
quietly
with
closed
eyes
and
peveril
keeping
wakeful
watch
beside
him
aunty
nimmo
had
been
sent
to
her
bed
long
since
and
connell
was
fast
asleep
on
the
floor
of
the
hall
just
outside
the
door
mary
darrell
sat
in
an
overcome
by
exhaustion
also
sleeping
lightly
as
the
growing
light
fell
on
her
face
crowned
by
a
wealth
of
hair
curling
in
tiny
ringlets
peveril
looked
at
her
curiously
and
wondered
why
he
had
never
thought
her
beautiful
until
that
moment
apparently
conscious
of
the
young
man
gaze
the
girl
suddenly
opened
her
eyes
and
a
faint
flush
suffused
her
pale
cheeks
ere
either
she
or
peveril
could
speak
the
muffled
sound
of
a
broke
the
morning
stillness
our
friends
have
come
miss
darrell
whispered
the
watcher
you
have
just
time
to
go
to
your
room
and
refresh
yourself
with
a
dash
of
cold
water
before
they
appear
nodding
assent
the
girl
accepted
the
suggestion
and
departed
then
peveril
sent
connell
to
meet
the
who
as
he
knew
would
steam
directly
into
the
basin
and
remained
to
finish
his
vigil
alone
suddenly
as
he
sat
absorbed
in
meditation
the
madman
who
had
been
watching
through
eyes
sprang
upon
him
without
a
sound
of
warning
and
clutched
his
throat
with
a
grip
not
even
the
utmost
exertion
of
peveril
splendid
strength
served
to
loose
that
horrid
hold
in
silence
he
fought
for
his
life
until
he
grew
black
in
the
face
and
his
eyes
started
from
their
sockets
his
head
seemed
on
the
point
of
bursting
he
reeled
staggered
and
then
together
with
his
terrible
assailant
fell
heavily
to
the
floor
as
they
did
so
the
old
man
head
struck
on
a
sharp
corner
he
uttered
a
moan
and
at
last
the
deadly
clutch
on
peveril
throat
was
relaxed
with
his
next
moment
of
consciousness
peveril
was
sitting
on
the
floor
gasping
for
breath
and
ralph
darrell
lay
motionless
beside
him
in
a
pool
of
blood
then
came
quick
steps
on
the
stair
and
mary
darrell
accompanied
by
major
arkell
and
the
doctor
from
red
jacket
entered
the
room
for
an
instant
the
girl
stared
at
the
scene
before
her
then
she
darted
forward
and
clasped
her
father
body
in
her
arms
crying
out
as
she
did
so
you
have
killed
him
richard
peveril
killed
an
old
man
sick
and
helpless
robbed
him
of
his
all
and
then
murdered
him
oh
papa
dear
dear
papa
why
did
i
leave
you
for
a
single
minute
my
how
she
hates
poor
mr
peril
whispered
nelly
trefethen
who
had
come
to
act
as
nurse
and
who
guided
by
mike
connell
reached
the
doorway
in
time
to
witness
the
tableau
as
well
as
to
hear
mary
darrell
cruel
words
chapter
xxviii
left
in
sole
possession
although
ralph
darrell
was
to
all
appearance
dead
the
doctor
pronounced
him
to
be
still
alive
and
caused
him
to
be
lifted
back
to
the
bed
where
he
dressed
his
wound
at
the
same
time
administering
restoratives
while
this
was
being
done
major
arkell
taking
charge
of
peveril
led
him
to
another
room
in
which
his
things
brought
from
the
trefethen
house
had
been
placed
the
young
man
was
still
trembling
from
his
recent
awful
experience
in
another
minute
all
would
have
been
over
with
me
he
said
in
describing
the
incident
to
his
friend
for
i
could
no
more
loosen
his
clutch
than
if
it
had
been
a
band
of
steel
that
fall
was
a
mighty
lucky
thing
then
commented
the
other
yes
i
suppose
it
was
for
apparently
nothing
else
could
have
saved
me
at
the
same
time
think
how
unpleasant
it
would
have
been
for
me
if
it
had
killed
him
and
i
had
been
charged
with
his
murder
oh
pshaw
no
one
would
have
imagined
such
a
thing
his
daughter
did
replied
peveril
in
whose
ears
mary
terrible
accusation
was
still
ringing
she
did
know
what
she
was
saying
you
must
remember
the
trying
circumstances
of
her
position
and
forgive
and
forget
everything
else
if
i
am
any
judge
of
human
character
she
is
just
the
girl
to
bitterly
regret
her
hasty
words
if
she
ever
recalls
having
uttered
them
of
course
i
forgive
her
said
peveril
but
i
doubt
if
i
can
forget
as
long
as
i
live
a
bath
in
water
as
hot
as
he
could
bear
it
followed
by
a
cold
douche
and
a
brisk
rubbing
with
the
coarse
towels
procured
from
aunty
nimmo
restored
the
young
man
to
his
normal
condition
then
he
exchanged
the
ragged
garb
of
a
miner
that
he
had
worn
ever
since
leaving
red
jacket
for
a
suit
of
his
own
proper
clothing
with
this
the
transformation
in
his
appearance
was
so
complete
that
when
a
little
later
mary
darrell
passed
him
in
the
hall
it
was
without
recognition
she
only
regarded
him
as
one
of
the
many
strangers
who
seemed
suddenly
to
have
taken
unauthorized
possession
of
her
home
at
the
doctor
reported
that
his
patient
was
sleeping
quietly
and
doing
wonderfully
well
in
fact
said
the
medical
gentleman
i
believe
the
that
resulted
from
his
fall
was
just
what
he
needed
and
as
he
seems
to
have
a
vigorous
constitution
unimpaired
by
intemperate
living
i
predict
for
him
a
speedy
recovery
this
prediction
was
so
far
fulfilled
that
within
two
days
ralph
darrell
was
sitting
up
and
by
the
end
of
a
week
he
had
very
nearly
regained
his
strength
at
the
same
time
his
excitability
had
wholly
disappeared
leaving
him
very
quiet
and
as
docile
as
a
child
but
with
little
memory
of
past
happenings
his
daughter
was
the
one
person
whom
he
recognized
and
to
her
he
clung
with
passionate
fondness
readily
accepting
her
every
suggestion
but
always
begging
her
to
take
him
back
to
his
eastern
home
his
rapid
convalescence
was
largely
due
to
her
devoted
care
and
to
the
capital
nursing
of
nelly
trefethen
who
proved
most
efficient
in
the
during
that
week
the
were
taken
by
mike
connell
whom
miss
darrell
engaged
expressly
for
the
purpose
but
peveril
was
not
asked
to
share
them
on
the
few
occasions
when
he
and
mary
chanced
to
meet
she
treated
him
with
formal
politeness
but
rarely
spoke
and
never
gave
him
the
opportunity
of
exchanging
with
her
more
than
a
few
commonplace
remarks
at
the
same
time
she
watched
him
furtively
and
he
seldom
left
the
house
or
entered
it
without
her
knowledge
she
had
learned
his
history
so
far
as
nelly
trefethen
knew
it
and
by
her
readiness
to
listen
encouraged
the
girl
to
talk
by
the
hour
on
this
theme
she
also
learned
one
thing
about
him
that
was
not
told
her
and
that
was
that
he
was
engaged
to
be
married
one
evening
nelly
and
connell
coming
back
from
a
walk
encountered
peveril
near
the
house
and
close
under
a
window
at
which
mary
happened
to
be
standing
as
the
young
man
was
about
to
pass
them
the
irishman
stopped
him
saying
oh
mister
peril
would
you
mind
telling
nelly
here
the
thing
you
told
me
down
the
new
shaft
that
time
i
do
think
i
remember
what
it
was
about
your
being
bespoke
oh
about
my
engagement
yes
i
remember
now
that
you
did
want
me
to
tell
miss
nelly
of
it
though
i
am
sure
i
ca
imagine
why
it
should
interest
her
arrah
mister
peril
do
every
young
woman
be
interested
to
know
if
she
to
smile
on
a
young
man
or
give
him
the
cold
stare
if
that
is
the
case
laughed
peveril
i
am
afraid
all
the
girls
must
give
me
the
cold
stare
for
i
certainly
am
engaged
and
by
the
way
miss
nelly
do
you
know
if
there
is
a
letter
awaiting
me
at
your
house
i
received
one
from
my
sweetheart
on
the
very
day
that
i
left
red
jacket
and
with
most
unpardonable
carelessness
managed
to
lose
it
without
having
even
opened
it
i
do
know
peril
i
mean
i
did
hear
mother
speak
of
it
stammered
the
girl
so
frightened
that
for
a
moment
she
had
no
idea
of
what
she
was
saying
i
do
mind
though
seeing
one
advertised
in
the
with
a
name
something
like
yours
she
added
more
coherently
then
i
must
have
dropped
it
on
the
street
and
whoever
found
it
must
have
been
honest
enough
to
return
it
to
the
i
will
write
at
once
for
it
and
am
much
obliged
for
your
information
some
days
later
peveril
did
write
to
the
red
jacket
postmaster
and
received
prompt
answer
that
the
bit
of
in
question
had
been
sent
to
the
office
so
he
wrote
to
washington
concerning
his
missing
letter
and
in
due
time
learned
that
it
had
been
returned
to
sender
then
as
he
had
no
idea
of
sender
present
address
he
decided
to
wait
until
hearing
from
her
again
before
attempting
to
forward
his
explanation
of
how
it
all
happened
in
the
meantime
he
was
extremely
interested
in
other
affairs
that
engrossed
more
and
more
of
his
attention
on
that
very
first
morning
he
had
shown
to
major
arkell
several
papers
that
came
to
him
with
his
baggage
among
these
were
boise
carson
letter
lawyer
ketchum
note
of
identification
and
the
famous
contract
under
which
he
claimed
a
in
the
copper
princess
at
a
later
date
he
also
attempted
to
show
these
papers
to
mary
darrell
but
she
declined
to
look
at
them
saying
that
as
she
did
not
doubt
the
validity
of
his
claim
she
had
no
desire
to
discuss
it
major
arkell
however
examined
the
papers
carefully
and
expressed
himself
as
thoroughly
satisfied
that
his
young
friend
was
a
in
the
mine
heretofore
known
as
darrell
folly
and
now
he
said
let
us
examine
the
property
and
see
whether
it
is
worth
anything
or
not
so
these
two
set
forth
on
a
tour
of
inspection
they
found
the
several
buildings
to
be
in
fair
order
and
all
machinery
in
an
excellent
state
of
preservation
then
they
descended
the
shaft
and
examined
the
material
through
which
the
several
galleries
had
been
driven
and
which
the
white
pine
manager
pronounced
as
barren
even
of
promise
as
any
rock
he
had
ever
seen
the
trouble
seems
to
be
he
said
that
they
persistently
drifted
in
exactly
the
wrong
direction
and
went
away
from
the
true
vein
which
i
believe
to
be
indicated
by
those
ancient
workings
over
yonder
instead
of
towards
it
thus
the
engineer
who
laid
out
this
mine
either
displayed
great
ignorance
or
else
your
property
does
not
include
that
strip
of
territory
but
i
tell
you
what
we
do
you
stay
here
and
hold
the
fort
for
a
few
days
while
i
go
and
look
the
thing
up
i
do
like
to
have
you
take
so
much
trouble
protested
peveril
no
trouble
at
all
my
dear
fellow
purely
a
matter
of
business
i
want
if
possible
to
become
associated
with
you
in
this
proposition
as
it
now
stands
your
mine
is
worthless
unless
it
includes
or
can
be
made
to
include
those
old
workings
i
believe
they
will
make
it
extremely
valuable
for
i
am
persuaded
that
the
vein
indicated
by
them
can
be
reached
at
a
lower
level
from
this
very
shaft
so
the
major
took
his
departure
and
peveril
waited
a
whole
week
for
his
return
in
the
meantime
he
familiarized
himself
with
his
property
and
by
means
of
a
careful
survey
established
the
relative
positions
of
the
prehistoric
mine
and
the
shaft
of
the
copper
princess
during
this
week
as
has
been
said
he
saw
very
little
of
mary
darrell
and
often
wondered
how
she
occupied
her
time
finally
there
came
a
day
when
miss
darrell
informed
mike
connell
that
as
her
father
was
now
so
much
better
it
would
no
longer
be
necessary
to
watch
with
him
at
night
so
the
honest
fellow
who
had
been
working
hard
with
peveril
on
his
measurements
and
was
rejoiced
at
the
prospect
of
an
unbroken
night
rest
retired
early
to
the
quarters
that
he
and
the
young
proprietor
occupied
together
at
some
distance
from
the
darrells
house
very
early
on
the
following
morning
the
two
men
were
awakened
by
a
loud
knocking
at
their
door
and
the
voice
of
nelly
trefethen
calling
as
though
in
distress
coming
shouted
peveril
as
they
both
sprang
from
bed
and
hurriedly
dressed
as
they
emerged
from
the
house
the
girl
exclaimed
they
gone
peril
gone
in
the
night
and
i
never
heard
a
sound
how
they
went
no
one
can
tell
for
all
the
outer
doors
were
left
locked
with
the
keys
on
the
inside
but
they
gone
for
i
have
hunted
high
and
low
without
finding
a
sign
of
them
who
have
gone
demanded
peveril
miss
mary
and
her
father
and
the
old
colored
woman
that
these
three
had
taken
a
mysterious
departure
was
only
too
apparent
when
the
two
men
returned
with
nelly
to
the
house
and
searched
it
from
top
to
bottom
then
under
connell
guidance
they
went
through
the
secret
passage
to
the
cavern
there
they
found
a
lighted
lantern
hung
on
the
stunted
cedar
just
outside
the
entrance
the
canvas
curtain
drawn
aside
the
derrick
swung
out
and
its
tackle
hanging
down
to
within
a
foot
of
the
black
ledge
but
that
was
all
three
months
after
that
time
peveril
received
the
following
letter
dear
peveril
i
feel
it
a
duty
to
tell
you
that
my
dear
father
has
at
length
passed
peacefully
away
and
so
will
never
trouble
you
again
at
the
very
last
he
spoke
lovingly
of
richard
peveril
and
said
he
was
a
splendid
fellow
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
he
referred
to
your
father
rather
than
to
yourself
he
was
also
perfectly
rational
on
all
subjects
except
that
of
the
princess
which
he
persisted
in
declaring
was
one
of
the
richest
copper
mines
of
the
world
i
of
course
know
better
for
i
realized
long
ago
how
truly
the
name
folly
described
that
unfortunate
venture
whatever
pleasure
you
may
find
in
owning
such
an
unremunerative
piece
of
property
you
may
enjoy
without
any
fear
of
molestation
for
i
as
my
father
sole
heir
shall
never
lay
claim
to
any
share
in
it
and
hereby
authorize
you
to
do
with
it
as
you
think
best
we
have
been
very
happy
since
we
left
you
so
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
the
opportunity
for
departure
came
and
we
embraced
it
i
have
but
one
more
thing
to
say
before
closing
this
correspondence
forever
i
humbly
beg
your
pardon
and
crave
your
forgiveness
for
the
cruel
injustice
that
i
once
did
you
in
a
moment
of
agony
trusting
that
you
are
happy
i
knew
of
your
engagement
and
prosperous
i
remain
always
under
obligations
your
friend
mary
darrell
with
this
letter
there
was
no
date
nor
address
and
its
only
was
the
stamp
of
the
railway
on
a
distant
eastern
road
chapter
xxix
a
royal
name
for
a
royal
mine
peveril
was
greatly
distressed
at
the
unforeseen
and
mysterious
disappearance
of
the
darrells
for
it
made
him
feel
as
though
he
had
driven
them
from
their
home
and
usurped
their
rights
the
place
also
seemed
very
empty
and
forlorn
without
mary
darrell
winning
face
and
presence
for
though
he
had
seen
but
little
of
her
and
had
reason
to
believe
that
she
did
not
feel
kindly
towards
him
he
now
realized
how
much
his
happiness
had
depended
on
the
knowledge
that
she
was
always
close
at
hand
then
too
the
domestic
establishment
that
ran
on
so
smoothly
under
the
supervision
of
aunty
nimmo
was
completely
broken
up
nelly
trefethen
must
of
course
return
at
once
to
red
jacket
and
this
she
did
that
very
day
on
mary
darrell
pony
under
escort
of
mike
connell
who
was
only
too
happy
to
make
the
journey
on
foot
the
few
men
employed
by
darrell
having
been
paid
off
and
discharged
the
departure
of
his
two
remaining
friends
left
the
young
proprietor
entirely
alone
in
a
place
as
desolate
as
though
it
were
beyond
the
reach
of
human
knowledge
the
sky
was
overcast
making
the
day
dark
and
cheerless
so
that
as
peveril
wandered
disconsolately
about
his
deserted
property
the
future
looked
to
him
as
gloomy
as
the
present
there
ca
be
anything
in
it
he
said
to
himself
as
he
gazed
moodily
down
the
black
mouth
of
the
shaft
of
course
the
men
who
sank
a
fortune
in
that
hole
would
have
found
it
out
long
ago
if
there
were
as
for
those
prehistoric
workings
on
which
the
major
counts
so
largely
i
do
believe
but
what
the
old
fellows
who
opened
them
also
made
a
pretty
thorough
of
everything
in
them
certainly
the
few
small
piles
of
copper
that
they
left
behind
would
not
now
pay
for
their
removal
it
has
all
been
very
pleasant
to
dream
of
becoming
a
wealthy
but
the
sooner
i
realize
that
it
is
only
a
dream
and
wake
from
it
to
the
necessity
of
earning
a
livelihood
by
hard
work
the
better
off
i
shall
be
at
any
rate
i
know
i
wo
spend
another
day
alone
in
this
place
if
i
did
i
should
go
crazy
no
wonder
old
man
darrell
lost
his
mind
under
the
conditions
surrounding
him
i
believe
major
arkell
will
come
back
anyway
why
should
he
if
as
is
probable
he
has
discovered
the
utter
worthlessness
of
the
property
he
knows
that
if
he
leaves
me
here
alone
i
must
turn
up
in
red
jacket
sooner
or
later
and
thinks
the
bad
news
he
has
to
tell
will
keep
until
i
do
well
i
shall
throw
the
whole
thing
up
and
go
to
him
for
a
job
there
is
anything
else
for
it
that
i
can
see
i
guess
he
will
give
me
something
to
do
and
after
a
while
i
shall
rise
to
be
a
or
timber
boss
or
even
and
then
well
then
i
can
settle
down
and
marry
some
nice
girl
like
nelly
trefethen
perhaps
achieve
fame
as
a
local
politician
and
so
end
my
days
in
a
blaze
of
glory
oh
it
a
lovely
prospect
as
for
poor
rose
there
no
use
in
thinking
any
longer
of
her
and
the
sooner
she
forgets
me
the
better
probably
she
has
ere
this
and
if
so
i
blame
her
at
length
the
long
day
dragged
itself
wearily
away
and
darkness
found
peveril
faint
with
hunger
for
he
had
not
had
the
heart
to
prepare
a
dinner
awkwardly
attempting
to
provide
himself
with
something
to
eat
in
aunty
nimmo
kitchen
a
single
lamp
threw
a
faint
ray
out
from
the
window
and
in
all
that
forlorn
little
mining
village
it
was
the
only
gleam
of
light
to
be
seen
suddenly
there
came
a
clatter
of
hoofs
and
a
cheery
hello
the
house
instantly
forgetful
of
his
culinary
operations
peveril
sprang
to
the
door
just
in
time
to
fling
it
open
and
welcome
major
arkell
who
was
alighting
from
a
horse
what
will
you
take
for
your
copper
princess
my
boy
shouted
the
as
he
entered
the
room
rubbing
his
hands
and
sniffing
expectantly
at
the
pleasant
odors
of
cooking
with
which
it
was
pervaded
about
five
cents
responded
peveril
done
it
a
bargain
cried
the
other
and
we
settle
the
details
of
the
transfer
after
eating
the
elegant
supper
that
i
discover
in
process
of
preparation
but
you
are
not
cooking
half
enough
i
could
eat
twice
as
much
as
that
and
still
be
hungry
let
me
show
you
how
what
has
become
of
aunty
nimmo
that
i
find
you
presiding
over
her
domain
never
mind
tell
me
later
after
you
called
connell
or
some
one
to
look
after
my
horse
i
will
gladly
attend
to
the
horse
major
if
you
will
take
charge
of
the
cooking
said
peveril
laughing
for
the
first
time
that
day
you
see
i
am
not
an
expert
at
this
sort
of
thing
and
no
i
should
judge
not
interrupted
the
other
glancing
comically
at
the
various
burned
lumpy
and
muddy
failures
with
which
the
stove
was
covered
but
i
do
the
trick
for
you
if
you
will
look
after
the
beast
half
an
hour
later
the
two
sat
down
to
a
bountiful
and
fairly
meal
that
in
the
major
cheery
company
seemed
to
poor
hungry
peveril
about
as
fine
a
one
as
he
had
ever
eaten
while
it
was
in
progress
he
told
of
the
happenings
of
the
past
week
including
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
the
darrells
but
as
the
major
did
not
seem
to
have
any
news
to
impart
in
return
he
concluded
that
there
was
none
to
tell
and
so
forbore
to
ask
questions
it
was
not
until
after
they
had
finished
supper
and
were
sitting
before
a
cheerful
blaze
in
the
cosey
of
the
darrell
house
that
the
major
said
now
for
our
bargain
though
i
could
of
course
hold
you
to
that
deal
i
wo
do
so
but
will
instead
make
an
offer
of
ten
thousand
dollars
for
of
your
in
the
copper
princess
what
gasped
peveril
yes
i
mean
it
and
in
addition
if
you
will
devote
that
sum
to
the
development
of
the
mine
i
will
advance
an
equal
amount
or
ten
thousand
dollars
more
for
the
same
purpose
now
do
say
a
word
until
i
have
explained
the
situation
by
a
careful
searching
of
old
records
and
maps
i
have
discovered
that
the
princess
property
not
only
embraces
our
prehistoric
mine
but
extends
some
distance
beyond
it
i
think
i
have
also
found
out
why
those
who
originally
laid
out
this
mine
started
their
cuts
on
the
wrong
side
of
their
shaft
they
evidently
knew
that
ancient
workings
existed
somewhere
in
this
neighborhood
but
they
were
deceived
as
to
their
location
for
on
all
the
maps
i
find
them
marked
but
the
place
thus
indicated
is
always
in
the
opposite
direction
from
that
in
which
we
now
know
them
to
lie
but
began
peveril
wait
a
minute
of
course
those
old
fellows
may
merely
have
struck
a
pocket
and
exhausted
it
but
i
do
believe
so
and
am
willing
to
risk
twenty
thousand
dollars
on
the
continuance
of
the
vein
if
it
is
there
that
sum
of
money
ought
to
enable
us
to
reach
it
from
your
present
shaft
and
if
we
do
strike
it
why
in
the
slang
of
the
day
the
copper
princess
is
simply
a
are
you
game
to
accept
my
offer
and
go
in
for
raising
that
kind
of
fruit
i
certainly
am
good
shake
the
bargain
is
made
and
the
sooner
we
get
to
work
the
better
ten
days
from
that
time
sees
the
legal
formalities
of
that
quickly
concluded
bargain
settled
and
the
mining
village
of
copper
princess
presenting
a
vastly
different
appearance
from
what
it
did
on
the
melancholy
day
when
peveril
was
its
sole
occupant
all
its
houses
are
now
occupied
and
from
every
window
cheery
lights
stream
out
with
the
coming
of
evening
shadows
peveril
occupies
the
comfortable
quarters
so
long
ago
provided
for
the
manager
and
until
recently
the
home
of
the
darrells
with
him
lives
a
young
engineer
of
about
his
own
age
recommended
by
major
arkell
and
here
too
are
the
several
offices
the
nearest
cottage
to
it
is
that
of
our
old
friends
the
trefethens
for
mark
trefethen
is
captain
of
the
mine
and
tom
is
shaft
boss
trefethen
and
nelly
have
their
hands
full
in
caring
for
both
these
houses
and
in
providing
meals
for
their
occupants
mike
connell
is
timber
boss
and
in
timbering
the
ancient
mine
as
well
as
the
new
workings
is
one
of
the
busiest
men
in
the
place
although
he
has
a
cottage
of
his
own
it
is
still
a
lonely
one
and
he
is
looking
eagerly
forward
to
the
time
when
the
anxiously
expected
vein
shall
be
struck
then
and
not
until
then
and
in
case
it
is
not
struck
at
all
perhaps
never
will
nelly
trefethen
become
his
wife
so
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
impatient
fellow
descends
the
shaft
each
day
to
anxiously
inspect
the
new
work
with
nearly
one
hundred
sturdy
miners
engaged
on
it
and
the
other
tasks
necessary
to
its
progress
it
is
driven
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
and
in
reality
advances
with
great
rapidity
though
to
connell
it
seems
to
creep
by
inches
the
great
chimney
pours
forth
clouds
of
smoke
heavy
skips
hurry
up
and
down
the
shaft
there
is
always
a
cheerful
ring
of
anvils
rafts
of
logs
lie
in
the
basin
men
and
teams
are
to
be
seen
in
every
direction
and
everywhere
is
heard
the
inspiring
hum
of
many
industries
though
as
yet
not
one
pound
of
copper
has
been
brought
up
from
the
underground
depths
for
weeks
and
months
the
work
goes
on
with
unabated
energy
peveril
always
willing
to
listen
to
advice
and
never
ashamed
to
ask
it
from
those
more
experienced
than
himself
is
everywhere
seeing
to
everything
and
directing
everything
though
he
is
thinner
than
when
we
first
met
him
and
his
face
has
taken
on
an
anxious
look
it
wears
at
the
same
time
an
expression
of
greater
manliness
and
determination
major
arkell
has
not
yet
appeared
on
the
scene
in
person
and
only
the
young
proprietor
is
known
as
the
responsible
head
of
all
this
bewildering
activity
it
is
bewildering
to
outsiders
to
see
the
folly
suddenly
transformed
into
one
of
the
busiest
of
the
copper
region
for
as
yet
no
one
except
connell
and
the
trefethens
knows
the
secret
hopes
of
the
proprietors
even
those
who
are
driving
the
new
far
beneath
the
surface
straight
as
a
die
towards
the
prehistoric
mine
though
on
a
much
lower
level
know
not
what
they
are
expected
to
find
at
length
three
months
have
passed
since
the
night
on
which
peveril
sold
for
ten
thousand
dollars
an
undivided
half
of
his
interest
in
the
copper
princess
since
that
time
he
has
not
once
left
the
scene
of
his
labors
his
hopes
and
his
fears
he
has
not
even
visited
red
jacket
since
the
morning
that
now
seems
so
long
ago
when
he
left
it
in
charge
of
a
gang
of
now
the
money
put
into
this
new
venture
is
very
nearly
exhausted
it
will
hold
out
for
one
more
but
that
is
all
and
as
yet
only
barren
rock
has
come
up
from
that
yawning
shaft
that
seems
to
gulp
down
money
with
an
appetite
at
once
inordinate
and
insatiable
a
huge
pile
of
rock
has
accumulated
about
its
mouth
if
it
were
copper
rock
it
would
be
worth
a
fortune
as
it
is
it
is
worse
than
worthless
for
it
contains
only
disappointed
hopes
and
yet
a
point
directly
beneath
the
ancient
workings
has
been
reached
and
passed
is
the
quest
a
vain
one
after
all
is
peveril
as
great
a
folly
as
darrell
ever
was
it
would
seem
so
and
the
young
proprietor
heart
is
heavy
within
him
he
has
just
received
the
letter
in
which
mary
darrell
declares
the
copper
princess
to
be
a
worthless
property
with
it
in
his
pocket
he
visits
the
mouth
of
the
shaft
intending
to
descend
as
he
approaches
it
a
skip
containing
several
men
comes
to
the
surface
when
they
emerge
into
daylight
they
are
yelling
in
delirious
excitement
one
of
them
leaps
out
and
runs
towards
him
shouting
incoherently
it
is
mike
connell
what
had
gone
wrong
has
there
been
some
terrible
accident
underground
we
struck

chapter
xxx
peveril
acquires
an
unshared
interest
an
autumn
evening
two
years
later
finds
richard
peveril
seated
in
the
of
the
university
the
most
thoroughly
and
comfortable
of
all
new
york
clubs
he
has
dined
alone
and
now
with
a
tiny
cup
of
black
coffee
on
the
stand
beside
him
is
reflectively
smoking
his
cigar
this
is
his
first
visit
to
the
east
since
he
left
it
more
than
two
years
before
almost
penniless
and
wellnigh
friendless
on
a
search
for
a
mine
that
he
was
assured
would
prove
worthless
when
found
today
that
same
mine
is
yielding
an
enormous
revenue
of
which
he
receives
or
a
sum
vastly
in
excess
of
his
simple
needs
for
he
is
still
a
bachelor
acting
as
manager
of
the
copper
princess
and
still
makes
his
home
in
the
little
mining
settlement
on
the
shore
of
the
great
western
lake
a
fortune
twice
as
large
as
his
own
and
derived
from
the
same
source
lies
idle
in
the
vaults
of
a
trust
company
awaiting
a
claimant
who
can
not
be
found
her
name
is
mary
darrell
and
though
from
the
very
first
peveril
has
guarded
her
interests
more
jealously
than
his
own
and
though
he
has
made
every
effort
to
discover
her
her
fortune
still
awaits
its
owner
he
has
not
only
been
disappointed
at
the
of
his
efforts
in
this
direction
but
is
deeply
hurt
that
the
girl
who
has
been
so
constantly
in
his
thoughts
during
his
two
years
of
loneliness
should
so
persistently
ignore
him
that
she
has
occupied
so
great
a
share
of
his
time
for
thinking
is
due
largely
to
the
fact
that
there
is
no
one
else
to
take
a
like
place
for
rose
bonnifay
long
since
released
him
from
his
engagement
to
her
and
he
has
contracted
no
other
as
soon
as
he
believed
his
to
be
in
new
york
he
wrote
her
a
long
letter
descriptive
of
his
and
promising
very
soon
to
rejoin
her
for
the
fulfilling
of
his
engagement
to
his
amazement
it
was
promptly
returned
to
him
endorsed
on
the
outside
in
miss
bonnifay
handwriting
as
my
last
to
you
came
back
to
me
unopened
i
now
take
pleasure
in
returning
yours
in
the
same
condition
he
immediately
wrote
again
only
to
have
his
second
letter
treated
as
the
first
had
been
except
that
this
time
it
came
to
him
without
a
word
from
that
day
he
had
heard
nothing
further
from
rose
bonnifay
now
business
had
called
him
to
new
york
and
he
had
reached
the
city
but
an
hour
before
his
appearance
at
the
club
here
he
gazed
curiously
about
him
as
one
long
strange
to
such
scenes
but
who
hopes
to
discover
the
face
of
a
friend
in
that
of
each
thus
far
he
had
not
been
successful
nor
had
he
been
recognized
by
any
of
the
men
many
of
them
in
who
came
and
went
through
the
spacious
rooms
peveril
was
also
in
for
he
had
conceived
a
vague
idea
of
going
to
some
theatre
or
possibly
to
the
opera
and
now
he
listlessly
glanced
over
the
advertised
list
of
attractions
in
an
afternoon
paper
while
he
was
thus
engaged
a
young
man
faultlessly
apparelled
and
pleasing
to
look
upon
stood
in
front
of
him
regarded
him
steadily
for
a
moment
and
then
grasped
his
hand
exclaiming
if
it
is
old
dick
peveril
come
to
life
again
after
an
age
of
burial
my
dear
fellow
i
am
awfully
glad
to
see
you
where
have
you
been
and
what
have
you
been
doing
all
these
years
heard
you
had
gone
west
to
look
up
a
mine
but
never
a
word
since
hope
you
found
it
and
that
it
turned
out
better
than
such
properties
generally
do
was
it
gold
silver
iron
or
what
you
may
imagine
its
nature
from
its
name
answered
peveril
who
was
genuinely
glad
to
meet
again
his
old
college
friend
jack
langdon
it
is
called
the
princess
the
princess
cried
the
other
by
jove
you
do
say
so
why
that
mine
is
the
talk
of
wall
street
and
if
you
own
any
part
in
it
you
must
be
a
millionaire
not
quite
that
laughed
peveril
though
i
am
not
exactly
what
you
might
call
poor
i
should
say
not
and
only
wish
i
stood
in
your
shoes
but
you
see
here
langdon
plunged
into
a
long
account
of
his
own
affairs
to
which
peveril
listened
patiently
finally
the
former
said
by
the
way
what
have
you
on
hand
for
nothing
in
particular
was
thinking
of
going
to
some
theatre
do
you
do
it
beastly
shows
all
of
them
nothing
but
vaudeville
nowadays
come
with
me
and
i
take
you
to
a
place
where
you
will
not
only
have
a
pleasant
time
but
will
meet
old
friends
as
well
you
remember
old
owen
owen
we
used
to
call
him
yes
well
he
is
here
in
new
york
and
has
made
a
pot
of
money
no
one
knows
how
shady
speculations
of
some
kind
and
between
ourselves
it
is
liable
to
slip
through
his
fingers
at
any
moment
but
neither
here
nor
there
he
married
about
a
year
ago
a
nice
enough
girl
who
has
apparently
lived
abroad
all
her
life
rather
a
but
entertains
in
great
shape
always
has
something
good
on
hand
generally
music
they
give
a
to
which
i
am
going
to
drop
in
for
a
while
and
of
course
they
will
be
delighted
to
see
you
so
do
utter
a
protest
but
just
come
along
in
accordance
with
the
programme
thus
provided
peveril
found
himself
an
hour
later
entering
the
of
a
spacious
mansion
on
upper
fifth
avenue
it
was
already
so
well
filled
that
it
was
some
time
before
the
could
approach
their
hostess
when
they
finally
reached
the
place
where
she
was
talking
and
laughing
with
a
group
of
guests
her
face
was
so
averted
that
peveril
did
not
see
it
until
after
langdon
had
said
owen
you
have
gathered
together
an
awfully
jolly
crowd
and
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
adding
another
to
their
number
he
is
an
old
college
friend
of
your
husband
and
quite
a
lion
just
now
for
he
is
the
owner
of
the
famous
copper
princess
that
every
one
is
talking
about
may
i
present
him
owen
my
friend
richard
peveril
with
this
langdon
stepped
aside
and
peveril
found
himself
face
to
face
with
rose
bonnifay
for
an
instant
she
was
deadly
pale
then
with
a
supreme
effort
she
recovered
her
the
blood
rushed
back
to
her
cheeks
and
extending
her
hand
with
an
engaging
smile
she
said
this
is
indeed
an
unexpected
pleasure
peveril
and
i
am
ever
so
much
obliged
to
langdon
for
bringing
you
did
he
know
i
wonder
that
you
were
an
old
friend
of
mine
as
well
as
of
owen
no
then
the
surprise
is
all
the
pleasanter
oh
there
is
mamma
and
she
will
be
delighted
to
meet
you
again
mamma
dear
here
is
our
old
friend
peveril
so
pleased
and
hope
we
shall
see
you
often
this
winter
illustration
peveril
finds
mary
again
other
newly
arrived
guests
demanding
owen
attention
at
this
moment
peveril
found
himself
borne
away
by
her
mother
who
had
greeted
him
effusively
and
now
seemed
determined
to
learn
everything
concerning
his
western
life
to
its
minutest
details
to
accomplish
this
she
led
him
to
a
corner
of
the
conservatory
for
what
she
was
pleased
to
term
an
uninterrupted
talk
of
old
times
but
which
really
meant
the
propounding
of
a
series
of
questions
on
her
part
and
the
giving
of
evasive
answers
on
his
while
peveril
was
wondering
how
he
should
escape
a
hush
fell
on
the
outer
assembly
and
some
one
began
to
sing
at
first
sound
of
the
voice
the
young
man
started
and
listened
attentively
who
is
she
he
asked
nobody
in
particular
responded
bonnifay
only
a
girl
whom
rose
met
when
she
was
studying
music
in
germany
i
fancy
she
spent
her
last
cent
on
her
musical
education
which
i
fear
wo
do
her
much
good
after
all
for
as
you
must
notice
she
is
utterly
lacking
in
style
she
is
dreadfully
poor
now
and
earns
a
living
by
singing
in
private
houses
all
her
voice
is
really
fit
for
you
know
so
rose
takes
pity
on
her
and
has
her
in
once
in
a
while
why
really
they
are
giving
her
an
encore
how
kind
of
them
and
yet
they
say
the
most
wealthy
are
the
most
heartless
but
you
are
not
going
peveril
i
have
asked
you
half
peveril
was
already
out
of
the
conservatory
and
making
his
way
towards
the
piano
as
though
irresistibly
fascinated
for
her
encore
the
singer
was
giving
a
simple
ballad
that
had
been
very
popular
some
years
before
the
last
time
peveril
heard
it
was
when
cruising
along
a
shore
of
lake
superior
and
it
had
come
to
him
from
somewhere
up
in
the
cliffs
at
last
he
had
found
mary
darrell
his
mary
as
he
called
her
in
quick
resentment
of
the
smiling
throng
about
him
who
her
to
sing
for
them
he
did
not
speak
to
her
then
nor
allow
her
to
see
him
but
when
with
her
task
finished
she
left
the
room
his
eyes
followed
her
every
movement
and
lingered
lovingly
on
her
beautiful
face
for
it
was
beautiful
he
knew
it
now
as
he
also
knew
that
he
loved
her
and
always
had
done
so
from
the
moment
that
he
first
beheld
her
a
vision
of
the
cliffs
when
accompanied
by
faithful
aunty
nimmo
she
left
the
house
he
was
waiting
outside
she
tried
to
hurry
away
as
he
approached
her
but
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
she
stood
still
trembling
violently
an
hour
later
in
the
modest
apartment
far
downtown
which
was
the
best
her
scanty
earnings
could
afford
he
had
told
his
story
mary
darrell
knew
that
she
was
no
longer
a
poor
struggling
singer
but
an
heiress
to
wealth
greater
than
she
had
ever
coveted
in
her
wildest
dreams
but
to
this
she
gave
hardly
a
thought
for
something
greater
finer
and
more
desirable
than
all
the
wealth
of
the
world
had
come
to
her
in
that
same
brief
space
of
time
she
knew
that
she
was
loved
by
him
whom
she
loved
for
he
had
told
her
so
even
now
he
stood
awaiting
with
trembling
eagerness
her
answer
to
his
plea
could
she
not
love
him
a
little
bit
in
return
would
she
not
go
back
with
him
as
his
wife
to
the
house
that
had
been
hers
and
still
awaited
her
by
the
shore
of
the
great
lake
but
i
thought
peveril
i
mean
i
heard
that
you
were
engaged
so
i
was
i
was
engaged
to
owen
at
whose
house
you
sang
this
evening
and
where
i
was
so
blessed
as
to
find
you
but
she
thought
me
unworthy
and
let
me
go
i
know
i
am
unworthy
still
but
mary
dear
wo
you
give
me
one
more
chance
wo
you
take
me
on
trial
well
then
on
trial
she
answered
though
in
so
low
a
tone
that
he
barely
caught
the
words
in
another
instant
he
had
folded
her
in
his
arms
for
he
knew
that
she
was
wholly
his
and
that
in

interest
