end
the
a
hospital
assistant
called
yergunov
an
fellow
known
throughout
the
district
as
a
great
braggart
and
drunkard
was
returning
one
evening
in
christmas
week
from
the
hamlet
of
ryepino
where
he
had
been
to
make
some
purchases
for
the
hospital
that
he
might
get
home
in
good
time
and
not
be
late
the
doctor
had
lent
him
his
very
best
horse
at
first
it
had
been
a
still
day
but
at
eight
a
violent
came
on
and
when
he
was
only
about
four
miles
from
home
yergunov
completely
lost
his
way
he
did
not
know
how
to
drive
he
did
not
know
the
road
and
he
drove
on
at
random
hoping
that
the
horse
would
find
the
way
of
itself
two
hours
passed
the
horse
was
exhausted
he
himself
was
chilled
and
already
began
to
fancy
that
he
was
not
going
home
but
back
towards
ryepino
but
at
last
above
the
uproar
of
the
storm
he
heard
the
barking
of
a
dog
and
a
murky
red
blur
came
into
sight
ahead
of
him
little
by
little
the
outlines
of
a
high
gate
could
be
discerned
then
a
long
fence
on
which
there
were
nails
with
their
points
uppermost
and
beyond
the
fence
there
stood
the
slanting
crane
of
a
well
the
wind
drove
away
the
mist
of
snow
from
before
the
eyes
and
where
there
had
been
a
red
blur
there
sprang
up
a
small
squat
little
house
with
a
steep
thatched
roof
of
the
three
little
windows
one
covered
on
the
inside
with
something
red
was
lighted
up
what
sort
of
place
was
it
yergunov
remembered
that
to
the
right
of
the
road
three
and
a
half
or
four
miles
from
the
hospital
there
was
andrey
tchirikov
tavern
he
remembered
too
that
this
tchirikov
who
had
been
lately
killed
by
some
had
left
a
wife
and
a
daughter
called
lyubka
who
had
come
to
the
hospital
two
years
before
as
a
patient
the
inn
had
a
bad
reputation
and
to
visit
it
late
in
the
evening
and
especially
with
someone
else
horse
was
not
free
from
risk
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
yergunov
fumbled
in
his
knapsack
for
his
revolver
and
coughing
sternly
tapped
at
the
with
his
whip
hey
who
is
within
he
cried
hey
granny
let
me
come
in
and
get
warm
with
a
hoarse
bark
a
black
dog
rolled
like
a
ball
under
the
feet
then
another
white
one
then
another
black
one
there
must
have
been
a
dozen
of
them
yergunov
looked
to
see
which
was
the
biggest
swung
his
whip
and
lashed
at
it
with
all
his
might
a
small
puppy
turned
its
sharp
muzzle
upwards
and
set
up
a
shrill
piercing
howl
yergunov
stood
for
a
long
while
at
the
window
tapping
but
at
last
the
on
the
trees
near
the
house
glowed
red
and
a
muffled
female
figure
appeared
with
a
lantern
in
her
hands
let
me
in
to
get
warm
granny
said
yergunov
i
was
driving
to
the
hospital
and
i
have
lost
my
way
it
such
weather
god
preserve
us
do
be
afraid
we
are
your
own
people
granny
all
my
own
people
are
at
home
and
we
did
invite
strangers
said
the
figure
grimly
and
what
are
you
knocking
for
the
gate
is
not
locked
yergunov
drove
into
the
yard
and
stopped
at
the
steps
bid
your
labourer
take
my
horse
out
granny
said
he
i
am
not
granny
and
indeed
she
was
not
a
granny
while
she
was
putting
out
the
lantern
the
light
fell
on
her
face
and
yergunov
saw
black
eyebrows
and
recognized
lyubka
there
are
no
labourers
about
now
she
said
as
she
went
into
the
house
some
are
drunk
and
asleep
and
some
have
been
gone
to
ryepino
since
the
morning
it
a
holiday
as
he
fastened
his
horse
up
in
the
shed
yergunov
heard
a
neigh
and
distinguished
in
the
darkness
another
horse
and
felt
on
it
a
cossack
saddle
so
there
must
be
someone
else
in
the
house
besides
the
woman
and
her
daughter
for
greater
security
yergunov
unsaddled
his
horse
and
when
he
went
into
the
house
took
with
him
both
his
purchases
and
his
saddle
the
first
room
into
which
he
went
was
large
and
very
hot
and
smelt
of
freshly
washed
floors
a
short
lean
peasant
of
about
forty
with
a
small
fair
beard
wearing
a
dark
blue
shirt
was
sitting
at
the
table
under
the
holy
images
it
was
kalashnikov
an
arrant
scoundrel
and
whose
father
and
uncle
kept
a
tavern
in
bogalyovka
and
disposed
of
the
stolen
horses
where
they
could
he
too
had
been
to
the
hospital
more
than
once
not
for
medical
treatment
but
to
see
the
doctor
about
horses
to
ask
whether
he
had
not
one
for
sale
and
whether
his
honour
would
not
like
to
swop
his
bay
mare
for
a
gelding
now
his
head
was
pomaded
and
a
silver
glittered
in
his
ear
and
altogether
he
had
a
holiday
air
frowning
and
dropping
his
lower
lip
he
was
looking
intently
at
a
big
another
peasant
lay
stretched
on
the
floor
near
the
stove
his
head
his
shoulders
and
his
chest
were
covered
with
a
sheepskin
he
was
probably
asleep
beside
his
new
boots
with
shining
bits
of
metal
on
the
heels
there
were
two
dark
pools
of
melted
snow
seeing
the
hospital
assistant
kalashnikov
greeted
him
yes
it
is
weather
said
yergunov
rubbing
his
chilled
knees
with
his
open
hands
the
snow
is
up
to
one
neck
i
am
soaked
to
the
skin
i
can
tell
you
and
i
believe
my
revolver
is
too
he
took
out
his
revolver
looked
it
all
over
and
put
it
back
in
his
knapsack
but
the
revolver
made
no
impression
at
all
the
peasant
went
on
looking
at
the
book
yes
it
is
weather
i
lost
my
way
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
dogs
here
i
do
believe
it
would
have
been
my
death
there
would
have
been
a
nice
and
where
are
the
women
the
old
woman
has
gone
to
ryepino
and
the
girl
is
getting
supper
ready
answered
kalashnikov
silence
followed
yergunov
shivering
and
gasping
breathed
on
his
hands
huddled
up
and
made
a
show
of
being
very
cold
and
exhausted
the
still
angry
dogs
could
be
heard
howling
outside
it
was
dreary
you
come
from
bogalyovka
do
you
he
asked
the
peasant
sternly
yes
from
bogalyovka
and
to
while
away
the
time
yergunov
began
to
think
about
bogalyovka
it
was
a
big
village
and
it
lay
in
a
deep
ravine
so
that
when
one
drove
along
the
highroad
on
a
moonlight
night
and
looked
down
into
the
dark
ravine
and
then
up
at
the
sky
it
seemed
as
though
the
moon
were
hanging
over
a
bottomless
abyss
and
it
were
the
end
of
the
world
the
path
going
down
was
steep
winding
and
so
narrow
that
when
one
drove
down
to
bogalyovka
on
account
of
some
epidemic
or
to
vaccinate
the
people
one
had
to
shout
at
the
top
of
voice
or
whistle
all
the
way
for
if
one
met
a
cart
coming
up
one
could
not
pass
the
peasants
of
bogalyovka
had
the
reputation
of
being
good
gardeners
and
they
had
gardens
in
spring
the
whole
village
was
buried
in
white
and
in
the
summer
they
sold
cherries
at
three
kopecks
a
pail
one
could
pay
three
kopecks
and
pick
as
one
liked
their
women
were
handsome
and
looked
well
fed
they
were
fond
of
finery
and
never
did
anything
even
on
but
spent
all
their
time
sitting
on
the
ledge
in
front
of
their
houses
and
searching
in
each
heads
but
at
last
there
was
the
sound
of
footsteps
lyubka
a
girl
of
twenty
with
bare
feet
and
a
red
dress
came
into
the
room
she
looked
sideways
at
yergunov
and
walked
twice
from
one
end
of
the
room
to
the
other
she
did
not
move
simply
but
with
tiny
steps
thrusting
forward
her
bosom
evidently
she
enjoyed
padding
about
with
her
bare
feet
on
the
freshly
washed
floor
and
had
taken
off
her
shoes
on
purpose
kalashnikov
laughed
at
something
and
beckoned
her
with
his
finger
she
went
up
to
the
table
and
he
showed
her
a
picture
of
the
prophet
elijah
who
driving
three
horses
abreast
was
dashing
up
to
the
sky
lyubka
put
her
elbow
on
the
table
her
plait
fell
across
her
shoulder
a
long
chestnut
plait
tied
with
red
ribbon
at
the
end
and
it
almost
touched
the
floor
she
too
smiled
a
splendid
wonderful
picture
said
kalashnikov
wonderful
he
repeated
and
motioned
with
his
hand
as
though
he
wanted
to
take
the
reins
instead
of
elijah
the
wind
howled
in
the
stove
something
growled
and
squeaked
as
though
a
big
dog
had
strangled
a
rat
ugh
the
unclean
spirits
are
abroad
said
lyubka
that
the
wind
said
kalashnikov
and
after
a
pause
he
raised
his
eyes
to
yergunov
and
asked
and
what
is
your
learned
opinion
osip
vassilyitch
are
there
devils
in
this
world
or
not
what
one
to
say
brother
said
yergunov
and
he
shrugged
one
shoulder
if
one
reasons
from
science
of
course
there
are
no
devils
for
it
a
superstition
but
if
one
looks
at
it
simply
as
you
and
i
do
now
there
are
devils
to
put
it
shortly
i
have
seen
a
great
deal
in
my
life
when
i
finished
my
studies
i
served
as
medical
assistant
in
the
army
in
a
regiment
of
the
dragoons
and
i
have
been
in
the
war
of
course
i
have
a
medal
and
a
decoration
from
the
red
cross
but
after
the
treaty
of
san
stefano
i
returned
to
russia
and
went
into
the
service
of
the
zemstvo
and
in
consequence
of
my
enormous
circulation
about
the
world
i
may
say
i
have
seen
more
than
many
another
has
dreamed
of
it
has
happened
to
me
to
see
devils
too
that
is
not
devils
with
horns
and
a
tail
that
is
all
nonsense
but
just
to
speak
precisely
something
of
the
sort
where
asked
kalashnikov
in
various
places
there
is
no
need
to
go
far
last
year
i
met
him
here
speak
of
him
not
at
night
near
this
very
inn
i
was
driving
i
remember
to
golyshino
i
was
going
there
to
vaccinate
of
course
as
usual
i
had
the
racing
droshky
and
a
horse
and
all
the
necessary
paraphernalia
and
what
more
i
had
a
watch
and
all
the
rest
of
it
so
i
was
on
my
guard
as
i
drove
along
for
fear
of
some
mischance
there
are
lots
of
tramps
of
all
sorts
i
came
up
to
the
zmeinoy
ravine
damnation
take
it
and
was
just
going
down
it
when
all
at
once
somebody
comes
up
to
me
such
a
fellow
black
hair
black
eyes
and
his
whole
face
looked
smutted
with
soot
he
comes
straight
up
to
the
horse
and
takes
hold
of
the
left
rein
he
looked
at
the
horse
then
at
me
then
dropped
the
reins
and
without
saying
a
bad
word
are
you
going
says
he
and
he
showed
his
teeth
in
a
grin
and
his
eyes
were
thought
i
are
a
queer
customer
am
going
to
vaccinate
for
the
smallpox
said
i
what
is
that
to
you
if
that
so
says
he
me
he
bared
his
arm
and
thrust
it
under
my
nose
of
course
i
did
not
bandy
words
with
him
i
just
vaccinated
him
to
get
rid
of
him
afterwards
i
looked
at
my
lancet
and
it
had
gone
rusty
the
peasant
who
was
asleep
near
the
stove
suddenly
turned
over
and
flung
off
the
sheepskin
to
his
great
surprise
yergunov
recognized
the
stranger
he
had
met
that
day
at
zmeinoy
ravine
this
hair
beard
and
eyes
were
black
as
soot
his
face
was
swarthy
and
to
add
to
the
effect
there
was
a
black
spot
the
size
of
a
lentil
on
his
right
cheek
he
looked
mockingly
at
the
hospital
assistant
and
said
i
did
take
hold
of
the
left
rein
that
was
so
but
about
the
smallpox
you
are
lying
sir
and
there
was
not
a
word
said
about
the
smallpox
between
us
yergunov
was
disconcerted
i
not
talking
about
you
he
said
lie
down
since
you
are
lying
down
the
peasant
had
never
been
to
the
hospital
and
yergunov
did
not
know
who
he
was
or
where
he
came
from
and
now
looking
at
him
he
made
up
his
mind
that
the
man
must
be
a
gypsy
the
peasant
got
up
and
stretching
and
yawning
loudly
went
up
to
lyubka
and
kalashnikov
and
sat
down
beside
them
and
he
too
began
looking
at
the
book
his
sleepy
face
softened
and
a
look
of
envy
came
into
it
look
merik
lyubka
said
to
him
get
me
such
horses
and
i
will
drive
to
heaven
sinners
ca
drive
to
heaven
said
kalashnikov
that
for
holiness
then
lyubka
laid
the
table
and
brought
in
a
big
piece
of
fat
bacon
salted
cucumbers
a
wooden
platter
of
boiled
meat
cut
up
into
little
pieces
then
a
in
which
there
were
sausages
and
cabbage
spluttering
a
decanter
of
vodka
which
diffused
a
smell
of
all
over
the
room
when
it
was
poured
out
was
put
on
the
table
also
yergunov
was
annoyed
that
kalashnikov
and
the
dark
fellow
merik
talked
together
and
took
no
notice
of
him
at
all
behaving
exactly
as
though
he
were
not
in
the
room
and
he
wanted
to
talk
to
them
to
brag
to
drink
to
have
a
good
meal
and
if
possible
to
have
a
little
fun
with
lyubka
who
sat
down
near
him
half
a
dozen
times
while
they
were
at
supper
and
as
though
by
accident
brushed
against
him
with
her
handsome
shoulders
and
passed
her
hands
over
her
broad
hips
she
was
a
healthy
active
girl
always
laughing
and
never
still
she
would
sit
down
then
get
up
and
when
she
was
sitting
down
she
would
keep
turning
first
her
face
and
then
her
back
to
her
neighbour
like
a
fidgety
child
and
never
failed
to
brush
against
him
with
her
elbows
or
her
knees
and
he
was
displeased
too
that
the
peasants
drank
only
a
glass
each
and
no
more
and
it
was
awkward
for
him
to
drink
alone
but
he
could
not
refrain
from
taking
a
second
glass
all
the
same
then
a
third
and
he
ate
all
the
sausage
he
brought
himself
to
flatter
the
peasants
that
they
might
accept
him
as
one
of
the
party
instead
of
holding
him
at
arm
length
you
are
a
fine
set
of
fellows
in
bogalyovka
he
said
and
wagged
his
head
in
what
way
fine
fellows
enquired
kalashnikov
why
about
horses
for
instance
fine
fellows
at
stealing
h
fine
fellows
you
call
them
nothing
but
thieves
and
drunkards
they
have
had
their
day
but
it
is
over
said
merik
after
a
pause
but
now
they
have
only
filya
left
and
he
is
blind
yes
there
is
no
one
but
filya
said
kalashnikov
with
a
sigh
reckon
it
up
he
must
be
seventy
the
german
settlers
knocked
out
one
of
his
eyes
and
he
does
not
see
well
with
the
other
it
is
cataract
in
old
days
the
police
officer
would
shout
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
you
shamil
and
all
the
peasants
called
him
that
he
was
shamil
all
over
the
place
and
now
his
only
name
is
filya
but
he
was
a
fine
fellow
lyuba
father
andrey
grigoritch
and
he
stole
one
night
into
rozhnovo
there
were
cavalry
regiments
stationed
there
and
carried
off
nine
of
the
soldiers
horses
the
very
best
of
them
they
were
frightened
of
the
sentry
and
in
the
morning
they
sold
all
the
horses
for
twenty
roubles
to
the
gypsy
afonka
yes
but
nowadays
a
man
contrives
to
carry
off
a
horse
whose
rider
is
drunk
or
asleep
and
has
no
fear
of
god
but
will
take
the
very
boots
from
a
drunkard
and
then
slinks
off
and
goes
away
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
with
a
horse
and
haggles
at
the
market
haggles
like
a
jew
till
the
policeman
catches
him
the
fool
there
is
no
fun
in
it
it
is
simply
a
disgrace
a
paltry
set
of
people
i
must
say
what
about
merik
asked
lyubka
merik
is
not
one
of
us
said
kalashnikov
he
is
a
harkov
man
from
mizhiritch
but
that
he
is
a
bold
fellow
that
the
truth
there
no
gainsaying
that
he
is
a
fine
fellow
lyubka
looked
slily
and
gleefully
at
merik
and
said
it
was
for
nothing
they
dipped
him
in
a
hole
in
the
ice
how
was
that
asked
yergunov
it
was
like
this
said
merik
and
he
laughed
filya
carried
off
three
horses
from
the
samoylenka
tenants
and
they
pitched
upon
me
there
were
ten
of
the
tenants
at
samoylenka
and
with
their
labourers
there
were
thirty
altogether
and
all
of
them
molokans
so
one
of
them
says
to
me
at
the
market
and
have
a
look
merik
we
have
brought
some
new
horses
from
the
fair
i
was
interested
of
course
i
went
up
to
them
and
the
whole
lot
of
them
thirty
men
tied
my
hands
behind
me
and
led
me
to
the
river
show
you
fine
horses
they
said
one
hole
in
the
ice
was
there
already
they
cut
another
beside
it
seven
feet
away
then
to
be
sure
they
took
a
cord
and
put
a
noose
under
my
armpits
and
tied
a
crooked
stick
to
the
other
end
long
enough
to
reach
both
holes
they
thrust
the
stick
in
and
dragged
it
through
i
went
plop
into
the
just
as
i
was
in
my
fur
coat
and
my
high
boots
while
they
stood
and
shoved
me
one
with
his
foot
and
one
with
his
stick
then
dragged
me
under
the
ice
and
pulled
me
out
of
the
other
hole
lyubka
shuddered
and
shrugged
at
first
i
was
in
a
fever
from
the
cold
merik
went
on
but
when
they
pulled
me
out
i
was
helpless
and
lay
in
the
snow
and
the
molokans
stood
round
and
hit
me
with
sticks
on
my
knees
and
my
elbows
it
hurt
fearfully
they
beat
me
and
they
went
away
and
everything
on
me
was
frozen
my
clothes
were
covered
with
ice
i
got
up
but
i
could
move
thank
god
a
woman
drove
by
and
gave
me
a
lift
meanwhile
yergunov
had
drunk
five
or
six
glasses
of
vodka
his
heart
felt
lighter
and
he
longed
to
tell
some
extraordinary
wonderful
story
too
and
to
show
that
he
too
was
a
bold
fellow
and
not
afraid
of
anything
i
tell
you
what
happened
to
us
in
penza
province
he
began
either
because
he
had
drunk
a
great
deal
and
was
a
little
tipsy
or
perhaps
because
he
had
twice
been
detected
in
a
lie
the
peasants
took
not
the
slightest
notice
of
him
and
even
left
off
answering
his
questions
what
was
worse
they
permitted
themselves
a
frankness
in
his
presence
that
made
him
feel
uncomfortable
and
cold
all
over
and
that
meant
that
they
took
no
notice
of
him
kalashnikov
had
the
dignified
manners
of
a
sedate
and
sensible
man
he
spoke
weightily
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
his
mouth
every
time
he
yawned
and
no
one
could
have
supposed
that
this
was
a
thief
a
heartless
thief
who
had
stripped
poor
creatures
who
had
already
been
twice
in
prison
and
who
had
been
sentenced
by
the
commune
to
exile
in
siberia
and
had
been
bought
off
by
his
father
and
uncle
who
were
as
great
thieves
and
rogues
as
he
was
merik
gave
himself
the
airs
of
a
bravo
he
saw
that
lyubka
and
kalashnikov
were
admiring
him
and
looked
upon
himself
as
a
very
fine
fellow
and
put
his
arms
akimbo
squared
his
chest
or
stretched
so
that
the
bench
creaked
under
him
after
supper
kalashnikov
prayed
to
the
holy
image
without
getting
up
from
his
seat
and
shook
hands
with
merik
the
latter
prayed
too
and
shook
kalashnikov
hand
lyubka
cleared
away
the
supper
shook
out
on
the
table
some
peppermint
biscuits
dried
nuts
and
pumpkin
seeds
and
placed
two
bottles
of
sweet
wine
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
peace
everlasting
to
andrey
grigoritch
said
kalashnikov
clinking
glasses
with
merik
when
he
was
alive
we
used
to
gather
together
here
or
at
his
brother
martin
and
my
word
my
word
what
men
what
talks
remarkable
conversations
martin
used
to
be
here
and
filya
and
fyodor
stukotey
it
was
all
done
in
style
it
was
all
in
keeping
and
what
fun
we
had
we
did
have
fun
we
did
have
fun
lyubka
went
out
and
soon
afterwards
came
back
wearing
a
green
kerchief
and
beads
look
merik
what
kalashnikov
brought
me
she
said
she
looked
at
herself
in
the
and
tossed
her
head
several
times
to
make
the
beads
jingle
and
then
she
opened
a
chest
and
began
taking
out
first
a
cotton
dress
with
red
and
blue
flowers
on
it
and
then
a
red
one
with
flounces
which
rustled
and
crackled
like
paper
then
a
new
kerchief
dark
blue
shot
with
many
colours
and
all
these
things
she
showed
and
flung
up
her
hands
laughing
as
though
astonished
that
she
had
such
treasures
kalashnikov
tuned
the
balalaika
and
began
playing
it
but
yergunov
could
not
make
out
what
sort
of
song
he
was
singing
and
whether
it
was
gay
or
melancholy
because
at
one
moment
it
was
so
mournful
he
wanted
to
cry
and
at
the
next
it
would
be
merry
merik
suddenly
jumped
up
and
began
tapping
with
his
heels
on
the
same
spot
then
brandishing
his
arms
he
moved
on
his
heels
from
the
table
to
the
stove
from
the
stove
to
the
chest
then
he
bounded
up
as
though
he
had
been
stung
clicked
the
heels
of
his
boots
together
in
the
air
and
began
going
round
and
round
in
a
crouching
position
lyubka
waved
both
her
arms
uttered
a
desperate
shriek
and
followed
him
at
first
she
moved
sideways
like
a
snake
as
though
she
wanted
to
steal
up
to
someone
and
strike
him
from
behind
she
tapped
rapidly
with
her
bare
heels
as
merik
had
done
with
the
heels
of
his
boots
then
she
turned
round
and
round
like
a
top
and
crouched
down
and
her
red
dress
was
blown
out
like
a
bell
merik
looking
angrily
at
her
and
showing
his
teeth
in
a
grin
flew
towards
her
in
the
same
crouching
posture
as
though
he
wanted
to
crush
her
with
his
terrible
legs
while
she
jumped
up
flung
back
her
head
and
waving
her
arms
as
a
big
bird
does
its
wings
floated
across
the
room
scarcely
touching
the
floor
what
a
flame
of
a
girl
thought
yergunov
sitting
on
the
chest
and
from
there
watching
the
dance
what
fire
give
up
everything
for
her
and
it
would
be
too
little
and
he
regretted
that
he
was
a
hospital
assistant
and
not
a
simple
peasant
that
he
wore
a
reefer
coat
and
a
chain
with
a
gilt
key
on
it
instead
of
a
blue
shirt
with
a
cord
tied
round
the
waist
then
he
could
boldly
have
sung
danced
flung
both
arms
round
lyubka
as
merik
did
the
sharp
tapping
shouts
and
whoops
set
the
crockery
ringing
in
the
cupboard
and
the
flame
of
the
candle
dancing
the
thread
broke
and
the
beads
were
scattered
all
over
the
floor
the
green
kerchief
slipped
off
and
lyubka
was
transformed
into
a
red
cloud
flitting
by
and
flashing
black
eyes
and
it
seemed
as
though
in
another
second
merik
arms
and
legs
would
drop
off
but
finally
merik
stamped
for
the
last
time
and
stood
still
as
though
turned
to
stone
exhausted
and
almost
breathless
lyubka
sank
on
to
his
bosom
and
leaned
against
him
as
against
a
post
and
he
put
his
arms
round
her
and
looking
into
her
eyes
said
tenderly
and
caressingly
as
though
in
jest
i
find
out
where
your
old
mother
money
is
hidden
i
murder
her
and
cut
your
little
throat
for
you
and
after
that
i
will
set
fire
to
the
inn
people
will
think
you
have
perished
in
the
fire
and
with
your
money
i
shall
go
to
kuban
i
keep
droves
of
horses
and
flocks
of
sheep
lyubka
made
no
answer
but
only
looked
at
him
with
a
guilty
air
and
asked
and
is
it
nice
in
kuban
merik
he
said
nothing
but
went
to
the
chest
sat
down
and
sank
into
thought
most
likely
he
was
dreaming
of
kuban
it
time
for
me
to
be
going
said
kalashnikov
getting
up
filya
must
be
waiting
for
me
goodbye
lyuba
yergunov
went
out
into
the
yard
to
see
that
kalashnikov
did
not
go
off
with
his
horse
the
snowstorm
still
persisted
white
clouds
were
floating
about
the
yard
their
long
tails
clinging
to
the
rough
grass
and
the
bushes
while
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
in
the
open
country
huge
giants
in
white
robes
with
wide
sleeves
were
whirling
round
and
falling
to
the
ground
and
getting
up
again
to
wave
their
arms
and
fight
and
the
wind
the
wind
the
bare
birches
and
unable
to
endure
its
rude
caresses
bowed
low
down
to
the
ground
and
wailed
god
for
what
sin
hast
thou
bound
us
to
the
earth
and
will
not
let
us
go
free
wo
said
kalashnikov
sternly
and
he
got
on
his
horse
one
half
of
the
gate
was
opened
and
by
it
lay
a
high
snowdrift
well
get
on
shouted
kalashnikov
his
little
nag
set
off
and
sank
up
to
its
stomach
in
the
drift
at
once
kalashnikov
was
white
all
over
with
the
snow
and
soon
vanished
from
sight
with
his
horse
when
yergunov
went
back
into
the
room
lyubka
was
creeping
about
the
floor
picking
up
her
beads
merik
was
not
there
a
splendid
girl
thought
yergunov
as
he
lay
down
on
the
bench
and
put
his
coat
under
his
head
oh
if
only
merik
were
not
here
lyubka
excited
him
as
she
crept
about
the
floor
by
the
bench
and
he
thought
that
if
merik
had
not
been
there
he
would
certainly
have
got
up
and
embraced
her
and
then
one
would
see
what
would
happen
it
was
true
she
was
only
a
girl
but
not
likely
to
be
chaste
and
even
if
she
were
need
one
stand
on
ceremony
in
a
den
of
thieves
lyubka
collected
her
beads
and
went
out
the
candle
burnt
down
and
the
flame
caught
the
paper
in
the
candlestick
yergunov
laid
his
revolver
and
matches
beside
him
and
put
out
the
candle
the
light
before
the
holy
images
flickered
so
much
that
it
hurt
his
eyes
and
patches
of
light
danced
on
the
ceiling
on
the
floor
and
on
the
cupboard
and
among
them
he
had
visions
of
lyubka
buxom
now
she
was
turning
round
like
a
top
now
she
was
exhausted
and
breathless
oh
if
the
devils
would
carry
off
that
merik
he
thought
the
little
lamp
gave
a
last
flicker
spluttered
and
went
out
someone
it
must
have
been
merik
came
into
the
room
and
sat
down
on
the
bench
he
puffed
at
his
pipe
and
for
an
instant
lighted
up
a
dark
cheek
with
a
patch
on
it
yergunov
throat
was
irritated
by
the
horrible
fumes
of
the
tobacco
smoke
what
filthy
tobacco
you
have
got
damnation
take
it
said
yergunov
it
makes
me
positively
sick
i
mix
my
tobacco
with
the
flowers
of
the
oats
answered
merik
after
a
pause
it
is
better
for
the
chest
he
smoked
spat
and
went
out
again
half
an
hour
passed
and
all
at
once
there
was
the
gleam
of
a
light
in
the
passage
merik
appeared
in
a
coat
and
cap
then
lyubka
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
do
stay
merik
said
lyubka
in
an
imploring
voice
no
lyuba
do
keep
me
listen
merik
said
lyubka
and
her
voice
grew
soft
and
tender
i
know
you
will
find
mother
money
and
will
do
for
her
and
for
me
and
will
go
to
kuban
and
love
other
girls
but
god
be
with
you
i
only
ask
you
one
thing
sweetheart
do
stay
no
i
want
some
fun
said
merik
fastening
his
belt
but
you
have
nothing
to
go
on
you
came
on
foot
what
are
you
going
on
merik
bent
down
to
lyubka
and
whispered
something
in
her
ear
she
looked
towards
the
door
and
laughed
through
her
tears
he
is
asleep
the
devil
she
said
merik
embraced
her
kissed
her
vigorously
and
went
out
yergunov
thrust
his
revolver
into
his
pocket
jumped
up
and
ran
after
him
get
out
of
the
way
he
said
to
lyubka
who
hurriedly
bolted
the
door
of
the
entry
and
stood
across
the
threshold
let
me
pass
why
are
you
standing
here
what
do
you
want
to
go
out
for
to
have
a
look
at
my
horse
lyubka
gazed
up
at
him
with
a
sly
and
caressing
look
why
look
at
it
you
had
better
look
at
me
she
said
then
she
bent
down
and
touched
with
her
finger
the
gilt
that
hung
on
his
chain
let
me
pass
or
he
will
go
off
on
my
horse
said
yergunov
let
me
go
you
devil
he
shouted
and
giving
her
an
angry
blow
on
the
shoulder
he
pressed
his
chest
against
her
with
all
his
might
to
push
her
away
from
the
door
but
she
kept
tight
hold
of
the
bolt
and
was
like
iron
let
me
go
he
shouted
exhausted
he
will
go
off
with
it
i
tell
you
why
should
he
he
wo
breathing
hard
and
rubbing
her
shoulder
which
hurt
she
looked
up
at
him
again
flushed
a
little
and
laughed
do
go
away
dear
heart
she
said
i
am
dull
alone
yergunov
looked
into
her
eyes
hesitated
and
put
his
arms
round
her
she
did
not
resist
come
no
nonsense
let
me
go
he
begged
her
she
did
not
speak
i
heard
you
just
now
he
said
telling
merik
that
you
love
him
i
dare
say
my
heart
knows
who
it
is
i
love
she
put
her
finger
on
the
key
again
and
said
softly
give
me
that
yergunov
unfastened
the
key
and
gave
it
to
her
she
suddenly
craned
her
neck
and
listened
with
a
grave
face
and
her
expression
struck
yergunov
as
cold
and
cunning
he
thought
of
his
horse
and
now
easily
pushed
her
aside
and
ran
out
into
the
yard
in
the
shed
a
sleepy
pig
was
grunting
with
lazy
regularity
and
a
cow
was
knocking
her
horn
yergunov
lighted
a
match
and
saw
the
pig
and
the
cow
and
the
dogs
which
rushed
at
him
on
all
sides
at
seeing
the
light
but
there
was
no
trace
of
the
horse
shouting
and
waving
his
arms
at
the
dogs
stumbling
over
the
drifts
and
sticking
in
the
snow
he
ran
out
at
the
gate
and
fell
to
gazing
into
the
darkness
he
strained
his
eyes
to
the
utmost
and
saw
only
the
snow
flying
and
the
snowflakes
distinctly
forming
into
all
sorts
of
shapes
at
one
moment
the
white
laughing
face
of
a
corpse
would
peep
out
of
the
darkness
at
the
next
a
white
horse
would
gallop
by
with
an
amazon
in
a
muslin
dress
upon
it
at
the
next
a
string
of
white
swans
would
fly
overhead
shaking
with
anger
and
cold
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
yergunov
fired
his
revolver
at
the
dogs
and
did
not
hit
one
of
them
then
he
rushed
back
to
the
house
when
he
went
into
the
entry
he
distinctly
heard
someone
scurry
out
of
the
room
and
bang
the
door
it
was
dark
in
the
room
yergunov
pushed
against
the
door
it
was
locked
then
lighting
match
after
match
he
rushed
back
into
the
entry
from
there
into
the
kitchen
and
from
the
kitchen
into
a
little
room
where
all
the
walls
were
hung
with
petticoats
and
dresses
where
there
was
a
smell
of
cornflowers
and
fennel
and
a
bedstead
with
a
perfect
mountain
of
pillows
standing
in
the
corner
by
the
stove
this
must
have
been
the
old
mother
room
from
there
he
passed
into
another
little
room
and
here
he
saw
lyubka
she
was
lying
on
a
chest
covered
with
a
patchwork
cotton
quilt
pretending
to
be
asleep
a
little
was
burning
in
the
corner
above
the
pillow
where
is
my
horse
yergunov
asked
lyubka
did
not
stir
where
is
my
horse
i
am
asking
you
yergunov
repeated
still
more
sternly
and
he
tore
the
quilt
off
her
i
am
asking
you
he
shouted
she
jumped
up
on
her
knees
and
with
one
hand
holding
her
shift
and
with
the
other
trying
to
clutch
the
quilt
huddled
against
the
wall
she
looked
at
yergunov
with
repulsion
and
terror
in
her
eyes
and
like
a
wild
beast
in
a
trap
kept
cunning
watch
on
his
faintest
movement
tell
me
where
my
horse
is
or
i
knock
the
life
out
of
you
shouted
yergunov
get
away
dirty
brute
she
said
in
a
hoarse
voice
yergunov
seized
her
by
the
shift
near
the
neck
and
tore
it
and
then
he
could
not
restrain
himself
and
with
all
his
might
embraced
the
girl
but
hissing
with
fury
she
slipped
out
of
his
arms
and
freeing
one
hand
the
other
was
tangled
in
the
torn
shift
hit
him
a
blow
with
her
fist
on
the
skull
his
head
was
dizzy
with
the
pain
there
was
a
ringing
and
rattling
in
his
ears
he
staggered
back
and
at
that
moment
received
another
blow
this
time
on
the
temple
reeling
and
clutching
at
the
doorposts
that
he
might
not
fall
he
made
his
way
to
the
room
where
his
things
were
and
lay
down
on
the
bench
then
after
lying
for
a
little
time
took
the
matchbox
out
of
his
pocket
and
began
lighting
match
after
match
for
no
object
he
lit
it
blew
it
out
and
threw
it
under
the
table
and
went
on
till
all
the
matches
were
gone
meanwhile
the
air
began
to
turn
blue
outside
the
cocks
began
to
crow
but
his
head
still
ached
and
there
was
an
uproar
in
his
ears
as
though
he
were
sitting
under
a
railway
bridge
and
hearing
the
trains
passing
over
his
head
he
got
somehow
into
his
coat
and
cap
the
saddle
and
the
bundle
of
his
purchases
he
could
not
find
his
knapsack
was
empty
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
someone
had
scurried
out
of
the
room
when
he
came
in
from
the
yard
he
took
a
poker
from
the
kitchen
to
keep
off
the
dogs
and
went
out
into
the
yard
leaving
the
door
open
the
had
subsided
and
it
was
calm
outside
when
he
went
out
at
the
gate
the
white
plain
looked
dead
and
there
was
not
a
single
bird
in
the
morning
sky
on
both
sides
of
the
road
and
in
the
distance
there
were
bluish
patches
of
young
copse
yergunov
began
thinking
how
he
would
be
greeted
at
the
hospital
and
what
the
doctor
would
say
to
him
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
think
of
that
and
to
prepare
beforehand
to
answer
questions
he
would
be
asked
but
this
thought
grew
blurred
and
slipped
away
he
walked
along
thinking
of
nothing
but
lyubka
of
the
peasants
with
whom
he
had
passed
the
night
he
remembered
how
after
lyubka
struck
him
the
second
time
she
had
bent
down
to
the
floor
for
the
quilt
and
how
her
loose
hair
had
fallen
on
the
floor
his
mind
was
in
a
maze
and
he
wondered
why
there
were
in
the
world
doctors
hospital
assistants
merchants
clerks
and
peasants
instead
of
simple
free
men
there
are
to
be
sure
free
birds
free
beasts
a
free
merik
and
they
are
not
afraid
of
anyone
and
do
need
anyone
and
whose
idea
was
it
who
had
decreed
that
one
must
get
up
in
the
morning
dine
at
midday
go
to
bed
in
the
evening
that
a
doctor
takes
precedence
of
a
hospital
assistant
that
one
must
live
in
rooms
and
love
only
one
wife
and
why
not
the
contrary
dine
at
night
and
sleep
in
the
day
ah
to
jump
on
a
horse
without
enquiring
whose
it
is
to
ride
races
with
the
wind
like
a
devil
over
fields
and
forests
and
ravines
to
make
love
to
girls
to
mock
at
everyone
yergunov
thrust
the
poker
into
the
snow
pressed
his
forehead
to
the
cold
white
trunk
of
a
and
sank
into
thought
and
his
grey
monotonous
life
his
wages
his
subordinate
position
the
dispensary
the
everlasting
with
the
bottles
and
blisters
struck
him
as
contemptible
sickening
who
says
it
a
sin
to
enjoy
oneself
he
asked
himself
with
vexation
those
who
say
that
have
never
lived
in
freedom
like
merik
and
kalashnikov
and
have
never
loved
lyubka
they
have
been
beggars
all
their
lives
have
lived
without
any
pleasure
and
have
only
loved
their
wives
who
are
like
frogs
and
he
thought
about
himself
that
he
had
not
hitherto
been
a
thief
a
swindler
or
even
a
brigand
simply
because
he
could
not
or
had
not
yet
met
with
a
suitable
opportunity
a
year
and
a
half
passed
in
spring
after
easter
yergunov
who
had
long
before
been
dismissed
from
the
hospital
and
was
hanging
about
without
a
job
came
out
of
the
tavern
in
ryepino
and
sauntered
aimlessly
along
the
street
he
went
out
into
the
open
country
here
there
was
the
scent
of
spring
and
a
warm
caressing
wind
was
blowing
the
calm
starry
night
looked
down
from
the
sky
on
the
earth
my
god
how
infinite
the
depth
of
the
sky
and
with
what
fathomless
immensity
it
stretched
over
the
world
the
world
is
created
well
enough
only
why
and
with
what
right
do
people
thought
yergunov
divide
their
fellows
into
the
sober
and
the
drunken
the
employed
and
the
dismissed
and
so
on
why
do
the
sober
and
well
fed
sleep
comfortably
in
their
homes
while
the
drunken
and
the
hungry
must
wander
about
the
country
without
a
refuge
why
was
it
that
if
anyone
had
not
a
job
and
did
not
get
a
salary
he
had
to
go
hungry
without
clothes
and
boots
whose
idea
was
it
why
was
it
the
birds
and
the
wild
beasts
in
the
woods
did
not
have
jobs
and
get
salaries
but
lived
as
they
pleased
far
away
in
the
sky
a
beautiful
crimson
glow
lay
quivering
stretched
wide
over
the
horizon
yergunov
stopped
and
for
a
long
time
he
gazed
at
it
and
kept
wondering
why
was
it
that
if
he
had
carried
off
someone
else
samovar
the
day
before
and
sold
it
for
drink
in
the
taverns
it
would
be
a
sin
why
was
it
two
carts
drove
by
on
the
road
in
one
of
them
there
was
a
woman
asleep
in
the
other
sat
an
old
man
without
a
cap
on
grandfather
where
is
that
fire
asked
yergunov
andrey
tchirikov
inn
answered
the
old
man
and
yergunov
recalled
what
had
happened
to
him
eighteen
months
before
in
the
winter
in
that
very
inn
and
how
merik
had
boasted
and
he
imagined
the
old
woman
and
lyubka
with
their
throats
cut
burning
and
he
envied
merik
and
when
he
walked
back
to
the
tavern
looking
at
the
houses
of
the
rich
publicans
and
blacksmiths
he
reflected
how
nice
it
would
be
to
steal
by
night
into
some
rich
man
house
ward
no
i
in
the
hospital
yard
there
stands
a
small
lodge
surrounded
by
a
perfect
forest
of
burdocks
nettles
and
wild
hemp
its
roof
is
rusty
the
chimney
is
tumbling
down
the
steps
at
the
are
rotting
away
and
overgrown
with
grass
and
there
are
only
traces
left
of
the
stucco
the
front
of
the
lodge
faces
the
hospital
at
the
back
it
looks
out
into
the
open
country
from
which
it
is
separated
by
the
grey
hospital
fence
with
nails
on
it
these
nails
with
their
points
upwards
and
the
fence
and
the
lodge
itself
have
that
peculiar
desolate
look
which
is
only
found
in
our
hospital
and
prison
buildings
if
you
are
not
afraid
of
being
stung
by
the
nettles
come
by
the
narrow
footpath
that
leads
to
the
lodge
and
let
us
see
what
is
going
on
inside
opening
the
first
door
we
walk
into
the
entry
here
along
the
walls
and
by
the
stove
every
sort
of
hospital
rubbish
lies
littered
about
mattresses
old
tattered
trousers
blue
striped
shirts
boots
and
shoes
no
good
for
anything
all
these
remnants
are
piled
up
in
heaps
mixed
up
and
crumpled
mouldering
and
giving
out
a
sickly
smell
the
porter
nikita
an
old
soldier
wearing
rusty
stripes
is
always
lying
on
the
litter
with
a
pipe
between
his
teeth
he
has
a
grim
surly
face
overhanging
eyebrows
which
give
him
the
expression
of
a
of
the
steppes
and
a
red
nose
he
is
short
and
looks
thin
and
scraggy
but
he
is
of
imposing
deportment
and
his
fists
are
vigorous
he
belongs
to
the
class
of
practical
and
people
prompt
in
carrying
out
orders
who
like
discipline
better
than
anything
in
the
world
and
so
are
convinced
that
it
is
their
duty
to
beat
people
he
showers
blows
on
the
face
on
the
chest
on
the
back
on
whatever
comes
first
and
is
convinced
that
there
would
be
no
order
in
the
place
if
he
did
not
next
you
come
into
a
big
spacious
room
which
fills
up
the
whole
lodge
except
for
the
entry
here
the
walls
are
painted
a
dirty
blue
the
ceiling
is
as
sooty
as
in
a
hut
without
a
chimney
it
is
evident
that
in
the
winter
the
stove
smokes
and
the
room
is
full
of
fumes
the
windows
are
disfigured
by
iron
gratings
on
the
inside
the
wooden
floor
is
grey
and
full
of
splinters
there
is
a
stench
of
sour
cabbage
of
smouldering
wicks
of
bugs
and
of
ammonia
and
for
the
first
minute
this
stench
gives
you
the
impression
of
having
walked
into
a
menagerie
there
are
bedsteads
screwed
to
the
floor
men
in
blue
hospital
and
wearing
nightcaps
in
the
old
style
are
sitting
and
lying
on
them
these
are
the
lunatics
there
are
five
of
them
in
all
here
only
one
is
of
the
upper
class
the
rest
are
all
artisans
the
one
nearest
the
door
a
tall
lean
workman
with
shining
red
whiskers
and
eyes
sits
with
his
head
propped
on
his
hand
staring
at
the
same
point
day
and
night
he
grieves
shaking
his
head
sighing
and
smiling
bitterly
he
takes
a
part
in
conversation
and
usually
makes
no
answer
to
questions
he
eats
and
drinks
mechanically
when
food
is
offered
him
from
his
agonizing
throbbing
cough
his
thinness
and
the
flush
on
his
cheeks
one
may
judge
that
he
is
in
the
first
stage
of
consumption
next
to
him
is
a
little
alert
very
lively
old
man
with
a
pointed
beard
and
curly
black
hair
like
a
negro
by
day
he
walks
up
and
down
the
ward
from
window
to
window
or
sits
on
his
bed
like
a
turk
and
ceaselessly
as
a
bullfinch
whistles
softly
sings
and
titters
he
shows
his
childish
gaiety
and
lively
character
at
night
also
when
he
gets
up
to
say
his
prayers
that
is
to
beat
himself
on
the
chest
with
his
fists
and
to
scratch
with
his
fingers
at
the
door
this
is
the
jew
moiseika
an
imbecile
who
went
crazy
twenty
years
ago
when
his
hat
factory
was
burnt
down
and
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
ward
no
he
is
the
only
one
who
is
allowed
to
go
out
of
the
lodge
and
even
out
of
the
yard
into
the
street
he
has
enjoyed
this
privilege
for
years
probably
because
he
is
an
old
inhabitant
of
the
hospital
a
quiet
harmless
imbecile
the
buffoon
of
the
town
where
people
are
used
to
seeing
him
surrounded
by
boys
and
dogs
in
his
wretched
gown
in
his
absurd
and
in
slippers
sometimes
with
bare
legs
and
even
without
trousers
he
walks
about
the
streets
stopping
at
the
gates
and
little
shops
and
begging
for
a
copper
in
one
place
they
will
give
him
some
kvass
in
another
some
bread
in
another
a
copper
so
that
he
generally
goes
back
to
the
ward
feeling
rich
and
well
fed
everything
that
he
brings
back
nikita
takes
from
him
for
his
own
benefit
the
soldier
does
this
roughly
angrily
turning
the
pockets
inside
out
and
calling
god
to
witness
that
he
will
not
let
him
go
into
the
street
again
and
that
breach
of
the
regulations
is
worse
to
him
than
anything
in
the
world
moiseika
likes
to
make
himself
useful
he
gives
his
companions
water
and
covers
them
up
when
they
are
asleep
he
promises
each
of
them
to
bring
him
back
a
kopeck
and
to
make
him
a
new
cap
he
feeds
with
a
spoon
his
neighbour
on
the
left
who
is
paralyzed
he
acts
in
this
way
not
from
compassion
nor
from
any
considerations
of
a
humane
kind
but
through
imitation
unconsciously
dominated
by
gromov
his
neighbour
on
the
right
hand
ivan
dmitritch
gromov
a
man
of
who
is
a
gentleman
by
birth
and
has
been
a
court
usher
and
provincial
secretary
suffers
from
the
mania
of
persecution
he
either
lies
curled
up
in
bed
or
walks
from
corner
to
corner
as
though
for
exercise
he
very
rarely
sits
down
he
is
always
excited
agitated
and
overwrought
by
a
sort
of
vague
undefined
expectation
the
faintest
rustle
in
the
entry
or
shout
in
the
yard
is
enough
to
make
him
raise
his
head
and
begin
listening
whether
they
are
coming
for
him
whether
they
are
looking
for
him
and
at
such
times
his
face
expresses
the
utmost
uneasiness
and
repulsion
i
like
his
broad
face
with
its
high
always
pale
and
unhappy
and
reflecting
as
though
in
a
mirror
a
soul
tormented
by
conflict
and
terror
his
grimaces
are
strange
and
abnormal
but
the
delicate
lines
traced
on
his
face
by
profound
genuine
suffering
show
intelligence
and
sense
and
there
is
a
warm
and
healthy
light
in
his
eyes
i
like
the
man
himself
courteous
anxious
to
be
of
use
and
extraordinarily
gentle
to
everyone
except
nikita
when
anyone
drops
a
button
or
a
spoon
he
jumps
up
from
his
bed
quickly
and
picks
it
up
every
day
he
says
to
his
companions
and
when
he
goes
to
bed
he
wishes
them
besides
his
continually
overwrought
condition
and
his
grimaces
his
madness
shows
itself
in
the
following
way
also
sometimes
in
the
evenings
he
wraps
himself
in
his
and
trembling
all
over
with
his
teeth
chattering
begins
walking
rapidly
from
corner
to
corner
and
between
the
bedsteads
it
seems
as
though
he
is
in
a
violent
fever
from
the
way
he
suddenly
stops
and
glances
at
his
companions
it
can
be
seen
that
he
is
longing
to
say
something
very
important
but
apparently
reflecting
that
they
would
not
listen
or
would
not
understand
him
he
shakes
his
head
impatiently
and
goes
on
pacing
up
and
down
but
soon
the
desire
to
speak
gets
the
upper
hand
of
every
consideration
and
he
will
let
himself
go
and
speak
fervently
and
passionately
his
talk
is
disordered
and
feverish
like
delirium
disconnected
and
not
always
intelligible
but
on
the
other
hand
something
extremely
fine
may
be
felt
in
it
both
in
the
words
and
the
voice
when
he
talks
you
recognize
in
him
the
lunatic
and
the
man
it
is
difficult
to
reproduce
on
paper
his
insane
talk
he
speaks
of
the
baseness
of
mankind
of
violence
trampling
on
justice
of
the
glorious
life
which
will
one
day
be
upon
earth
of
the
which
remind
him
every
minute
of
the
stupidity
and
cruelty
of
oppressors
it
makes
a
disorderly
incoherent
potpourri
of
themes
old
but
not
yet
out
of
date
ii
some
twelve
or
fifteen
years
ago
an
official
called
gromov
a
highly
respectable
and
prosperous
person
was
living
in
his
own
house
in
the
principal
street
of
the
town
he
had
two
sons
sergey
and
ivan
when
sergey
was
a
student
in
his
fourth
year
he
was
taken
ill
with
galloping
consumption
and
died
and
his
death
was
as
it
were
the
first
of
a
whole
series
of
calamities
which
suddenly
showered
on
the
gromov
family
within
a
week
of
sergey
funeral
the
old
father
was
put
on
trial
for
fraud
and
misappropriation
and
he
died
of
typhoid
in
the
prison
hospital
soon
afterwards
the
house
with
all
their
belongings
was
sold
by
auction
and
ivan
dmitritch
and
his
mother
were
left
entirely
without
means
hitherto
in
his
father
lifetime
ivan
dmitritch
who
was
studying
in
the
university
of
petersburg
had
received
an
allowance
of
sixty
or
seventy
roubles
a
month
and
had
had
no
conception
of
poverty
now
he
had
to
make
an
abrupt
change
in
his
life
he
had
to
spend
his
time
from
morning
to
night
giving
lessons
for
next
to
nothing
to
work
at
copying
and
with
all
that
to
go
hungry
as
all
his
earnings
were
sent
to
keep
his
mother
ivan
dmitritch
could
not
stand
such
a
life
he
lost
heart
and
strength
and
giving
up
the
university
went
home
here
through
interest
he
obtained
the
post
of
teacher
in
the
district
school
but
could
not
get
on
with
his
colleagues
was
not
liked
by
the
boys
and
soon
gave
up
the
post
his
mother
died
he
was
for
six
months
without
work
living
on
nothing
but
bread
and
water
then
he
became
a
court
usher
he
kept
this
post
until
he
was
dismissed
owing
to
his
illness
he
had
never
even
in
his
young
student
days
given
the
impression
of
being
perfectly
healthy
he
had
always
been
pale
thin
and
given
to
catching
cold
he
ate
little
and
slept
badly
a
single
glass
of
wine
went
to
his
head
and
made
him
hysterical
he
always
had
a
craving
for
society
but
owing
to
his
irritable
temperament
and
suspiciousness
he
never
became
very
intimate
with
anyone
and
had
no
friends
he
always
spoke
with
contempt
of
his
saying
that
their
coarse
ignorance
and
sleepy
animal
existence
seemed
to
him
loathsome
and
horrible
he
spoke
in
a
loud
tenor
with
heat
and
invariably
either
with
scorn
and
indignation
or
with
wonder
and
enthusiasm
and
always
with
perfect
sincerity
whatever
one
talked
to
him
about
he
always
brought
it
round
to
the
same
subject
that
life
was
dull
and
stifling
in
the
town
that
the
townspeople
had
no
lofty
interests
but
lived
a
dingy
meaningless
life
diversified
by
violence
coarse
profligacy
and
hypocrisy
that
scoundrels
were
well
fed
and
clothed
while
honest
men
lived
from
hand
to
mouth
that
they
needed
schools
a
progressive
local
paper
a
theatre
public
lectures
the
of
the
intellectual
elements
that
society
must
see
its
failings
and
be
horrified
in
his
criticisms
of
people
he
laid
on
the
colours
thick
using
only
black
and
white
and
no
fine
shades
mankind
was
divided
for
him
into
honest
men
and
scoundrels
there
was
nothing
in
between
he
always
spoke
with
passion
and
enthusiasm
of
women
and
of
love
but
he
had
never
been
in
love
in
spite
of
the
severity
of
his
judgments
and
his
nervousness
he
was
liked
and
behind
his
back
was
spoken
of
affectionately
as
vanya
his
innate
refinement
and
readiness
to
be
of
service
his
good
breeding
his
moral
purity
and
his
shabby
coat
his
frail
appearance
and
family
misfortunes
aroused
a
kind
warm
sorrowful
feeling
moreover
he
was
well
educated
and
well
read
according
to
the
townspeople
notions
he
knew
everything
and
was
in
their
eyes
something
like
a
walking
encyclopedia
he
had
read
a
great
deal
he
would
sit
at
the
club
nervously
pulling
at
his
beard
and
looking
through
the
magazines
and
books
and
from
his
face
one
could
see
that
he
was
not
reading
but
devouring
the
pages
without
giving
himself
time
to
digest
what
he
read
it
must
be
supposed
that
reading
was
one
of
his
morbid
habits
as
he
fell
upon
anything
that
came
into
his
hands
with
equal
avidity
even
last
year
newspapers
and
calendars
at
home
he
always
read
lying
down
iii
one
autumn
morning
ivan
dmitritch
turning
up
the
collar
of
his
greatcoat
and
splashing
through
the
mud
made
his
way
by
and
back
lanes
to
see
some
artisan
and
to
collect
some
payment
that
was
owing
he
was
in
a
gloomy
mood
as
he
always
was
in
the
morning
in
one
of
the
he
was
met
by
two
convicts
in
fetters
and
four
soldiers
with
rifles
in
charge
of
them
ivan
dmitritch
had
very
often
met
convicts
before
and
they
had
always
excited
feelings
of
compassion
and
discomfort
in
him
but
now
this
meeting
made
a
peculiar
strange
impression
on
him
it
suddenly
seemed
to
him
for
some
reason
that
he
too
might
be
put
into
fetters
and
led
through
the
mud
to
prison
like
that
after
visiting
the
artisan
on
the
way
home
he
met
near
the
post
office
a
police
superintendent
of
his
acquaintance
who
greeted
him
and
walked
a
few
paces
along
the
street
with
him
and
for
some
reason
this
seemed
to
him
suspicious
at
home
he
could
not
get
the
convicts
or
the
soldiers
with
their
rifles
out
of
his
head
all
day
and
an
unaccountable
inward
agitation
prevented
him
from
reading
or
concentrating
his
mind
in
the
evening
he
did
not
light
his
lamp
and
at
night
he
could
not
sleep
but
kept
thinking
that
he
might
be
arrested
put
into
fetters
and
thrown
into
prison
he
did
not
know
of
any
harm
he
had
done
and
could
be
certain
that
he
would
never
be
guilty
of
murder
arson
or
theft
in
the
future
either
but
was
it
not
easy
to
commit
a
crime
by
accident
unconsciously
and
was
not
false
witness
always
possible
and
indeed
miscarriage
of
justice
it
was
not
without
good
reason
that
the
agelong
experience
of
the
simple
people
teaches
that
beggary
and
prison
are
ills
none
can
be
safe
from
a
judicial
mistake
is
very
possible
as
legal
proceedings
are
conducted
nowadays
and
there
is
nothing
to
be
wondered
at
in
it
people
who
have
an
official
professional
relation
to
other
men
sufferings
for
instance
judges
police
officers
doctors
in
course
of
time
through
habit
grow
so
callous
that
they
can
not
even
if
they
wish
it
take
any
but
a
formal
attitude
to
their
clients
in
this
respect
they
are
not
different
from
the
peasant
who
slaughters
sheep
and
calves
in
the
and
does
not
notice
the
blood
with
this
formal
soulless
attitude
to
human
personality
the
judge
needs
but
one
thing
time
in
order
to
deprive
an
innocent
man
of
all
rights
of
property
and
to
condemn
him
to
penal
servitude
only
the
time
spent
on
performing
certain
formalities
for
which
the
judge
is
paid
his
salary
and
then
it
is
all
over
then
you
may
look
in
vain
for
justice
and
protection
in
this
dirty
wretched
little
town
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
a
railway
station
and
indeed
is
it
not
absurd
even
to
think
of
justice
when
every
kind
of
violence
is
accepted
by
society
as
a
rational
and
consistent
necessity
and
every
act
of
mercy
for
instance
a
verdict
of
acquittal
calls
forth
a
perfect
outburst
of
dissatisfied
and
revengeful
feeling
in
the
morning
ivan
dmitritch
got
up
from
his
bed
in
a
state
of
horror
with
cold
perspiration
on
his
forehead
completely
convinced
that
he
might
be
arrested
any
minute
since
his
gloomy
thoughts
of
yesterday
had
haunted
him
so
long
he
thought
it
must
be
that
there
was
some
truth
in
them
they
could
not
indeed
have
come
into
his
mind
without
any
grounds
whatever
a
policeman
walking
slowly
passed
by
the
windows
that
was
not
for
nothing
here
were
two
men
standing
still
and
silent
near
the
house
why
were
they
silent
and
agonizing
days
and
nights
followed
for
ivan
dmitritch
everyone
who
passed
by
the
windows
or
came
into
the
yard
seemed
to
him
a
spy
or
a
detective
at
midday
the
chief
of
the
police
usually
drove
down
the
street
with
a
pair
of
horses
he
was
going
from
his
estate
near
the
town
to
the
police
department
but
ivan
dmitritch
fancied
every
time
that
he
was
driving
especially
quickly
and
that
he
had
a
peculiar
expression
it
was
evident
that
he
was
in
haste
to
announce
that
there
was
a
very
important
criminal
in
the
town
ivan
dmitritch
started
at
every
ring
at
the
bell
and
knock
at
the
gate
and
was
agitated
whenever
he
came
upon
anyone
new
at
his
landlady
when
he
met
police
officers
and
gendarmes
he
smiled
and
began
whistling
so
as
to
seem
unconcerned
he
could
not
sleep
for
whole
nights
in
succession
expecting
to
be
arrested
but
he
snored
loudly
and
sighed
as
though
in
deep
sleep
that
his
landlady
might
think
he
was
asleep
for
if
he
could
not
sleep
it
meant
that
he
was
tormented
by
the
stings
of
conscience
what
a
piece
of
evidence
facts
and
common
sense
persuaded
him
that
all
these
terrors
were
nonsense
and
morbidity
that
if
one
looked
at
the
matter
more
broadly
there
was
nothing
really
terrible
in
arrest
and
imprisonment
so
long
as
the
conscience
is
at
ease
but
the
more
sensibly
and
logically
he
reasoned
the
more
acute
and
agonizing
his
mental
distress
became
it
might
be
compared
with
the
story
of
a
hermit
who
tried
to
cut
a
for
himself
in
a
virgin
forest
the
more
zealously
he
worked
with
his
axe
the
thicker
the
forest
grew
in
the
end
ivan
dmitritch
seeing
it
was
useless
gave
up
reasoning
altogether
and
abandoned
himself
entirely
to
despair
and
terror
he
began
to
avoid
people
and
to
seek
solitude
his
official
work
had
been
distasteful
to
him
before
now
it
became
unbearable
to
him
he
was
afraid
they
would
somehow
get
him
into
trouble
would
put
a
bribe
in
his
pocket
unnoticed
and
then
denounce
him
or
that
he
would
accidentally
make
a
mistake
in
official
papers
that
would
appear
to
be
fraudulent
or
would
lose
other
people
money
it
is
strange
that
his
imagination
had
never
at
other
times
been
so
agile
and
inventive
as
now
when
every
day
he
thought
of
thousands
of
different
reasons
for
being
seriously
anxious
over
his
freedom
and
honour
but
on
the
other
hand
his
interest
in
the
outer
world
in
books
in
particular
grew
sensibly
fainter
and
his
memory
began
to
fail
him
in
the
spring
when
the
snow
melted
there
were
found
in
the
ravine
near
the
cemetery
two
corpses
the
bodies
of
an
old
woman
and
a
boy
bearing
the
traces
of
death
by
violence
nothing
was
talked
of
but
these
bodies
and
their
unknown
murderers
that
people
might
not
think
he
had
been
guilty
of
the
crime
ivan
dmitritch
walked
about
the
streets
smiling
and
when
he
met
acquaintances
he
turned
pale
flushed
and
began
declaring
that
there
was
no
greater
crime
than
the
murder
of
the
weak
and
defenceless
but
this
duplicity
soon
exhausted
him
and
after
some
reflection
he
decided
that
in
his
position
the
best
thing
to
do
was
to
hide
in
his
landlady
cellar
he
sat
in
the
cellar
all
day
and
then
all
night
then
another
day
was
fearfully
cold
and
waiting
till
dusk
stole
secretly
like
a
thief
back
to
his
room
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
till
daybreak
listening
without
stirring
very
early
in
the
morning
before
sunrise
some
workmen
came
into
the
house
ivan
dmitritch
knew
perfectly
well
that
they
had
come
to
mend
the
stove
in
the
kitchen
but
terror
told
him
that
they
were
police
officers
disguised
as
workmen
he
slipped
stealthily
out
of
the
flat
and
overcome
by
terror
ran
along
the
street
without
his
cap
and
coat
dogs
raced
after
him
barking
a
peasant
shouted
somewhere
behind
him
the
wind
whistled
in
his
ears
and
it
seemed
to
ivan
dmitritch
that
the
force
and
violence
of
the
whole
world
was
massed
together
behind
his
back
and
was
chasing
after
him
he
was
stopped
and
brought
home
and
his
landlady
sent
for
a
doctor
doctor
andrey
yefimitch
of
whom
we
shall
have
more
to
say
hereafter
prescribed
cold
compresses
on
his
head
and
laurel
drops
shook
his
head
and
went
away
telling
the
landlady
he
should
not
come
again
as
one
should
not
interfere
with
people
who
are
going
out
of
their
minds
as
he
had
not
the
means
to
live
at
home
and
be
nursed
ivan
dmitritch
was
soon
sent
to
the
hospital
and
was
there
put
into
the
ward
for
venereal
patients
he
could
not
sleep
at
night
was
full
of
whims
and
fancies
and
disturbed
the
patients
and
was
soon
afterwards
by
andrey
yefimitch
orders
transferred
to
ward
no
within
a
year
ivan
dmitritch
was
completely
forgotten
in
the
town
and
his
books
heaped
up
by
his
landlady
in
a
sledge
in
the
shed
were
pulled
to
pieces
by
boys
iv
ivan
dmitritch
neighbour
on
the
left
hand
is
as
i
have
said
already
the
jew
moiseika
his
neighbour
on
the
right
hand
is
a
peasant
so
rolling
in
fat
that
he
is
almost
spherical
with
a
blankly
stupid
face
utterly
devoid
of
thought
this
is
a
motionless
gluttonous
unclean
animal
who
has
long
ago
lost
all
powers
of
thought
or
feeling
an
acrid
stifling
stench
always
comes
from
him
nikita
who
has
to
clean
up
after
him
beats
him
terribly
with
all
his
might
not
sparing
his
fists
and
what
is
dreadful
is
not
his
being
beaten
that
one
can
get
used
to
but
the
fact
that
this
stupefied
creature
does
not
respond
to
the
blows
with
a
sound
or
a
movement
nor
by
a
look
in
the
eyes
but
only
sways
a
little
like
a
heavy
barrel
the
fifth
and
last
inhabitant
of
ward
no
is
a
man
of
the
artisan
class
who
had
once
been
a
sorter
in
the
post
office
a
thinnish
fair
little
man
with
a
but
rather
sly
face
to
judge
from
the
clear
cheerful
look
in
his
calm
and
intelligent
eyes
he
has
some
pleasant
idea
in
his
mind
and
has
some
very
important
and
agreeable
secret
he
has
under
his
pillow
and
under
his
mattress
something
that
he
never
shows
anyone
not
from
fear
of
its
being
taken
from
him
and
stolen
but
from
modesty
sometimes
he
goes
to
the
window
and
turning
his
back
to
his
companions
puts
something
on
his
breast
and
bending
his
head
looks
at
it
if
you
go
up
to
him
at
such
a
moment
he
is
overcome
with
confusion
and
snatches
something
off
his
breast
but
it
is
not
difficult
to
guess
his
secret
congratulate
me
he
often
says
to
ivan
dmitritch
i
have
been
presented
with
the
stanislav
order
of
the
second
degree
with
the
star
the
second
degree
with
the
star
is
only
given
to
foreigners
but
for
some
reason
they
want
to
make
an
exception
for
me
he
says
with
a
smile
shrugging
his
shoulders
in
perplexity
that
i
must
confess
i
did
not
expect
i
do
understand
anything
about
that
ivan
dmitritch
replies
morosely
but
do
you
know
what
i
shall
attain
to
sooner
or
later
the
former
sorter
persists
screwing
up
his
eyes
slyly
i
shall
certainly
get
the
swedish
star
that
an
order
it
is
worth
working
for
a
white
cross
with
a
black
ribbon
it
very
beautiful
probably
in
no
other
place
is
life
so
monotonous
as
in
this
ward
in
the
morning
the
patients
except
the
paralytic
and
the
fat
peasant
wash
in
the
entry
at
a
big
tab
and
wipe
themselves
with
the
skirts
of
their
after
that
they
drink
tea
out
of
tin
mugs
which
nikita
brings
them
out
of
the
main
building
everyone
is
allowed
one
mugful
at
midday
they
have
soup
made
out
of
sour
cabbage
and
boiled
grain
in
the
evening
their
supper
consists
of
grain
left
from
dinner
in
the
intervals
they
lie
down
sleep
look
out
of
window
and
walk
from
one
corner
to
the
other
and
so
every
day
even
the
former
sorter
always
talks
of
the
same
orders
fresh
faces
are
rarely
seen
in
ward
no
the
doctor
has
not
taken
in
any
new
mental
cases
for
a
long
time
and
the
people
who
are
fond
of
visiting
lunatic
asylums
are
few
in
this
world
once
every
two
months
semyon
lazaritch
the
barber
appears
in
the
ward
how
he
cuts
the
patients
hair
and
how
nikita
helps
him
to
do
it
and
what
a
trepidation
the
lunatics
are
always
thrown
into
by
the
arrival
of
the
drunken
smiling
barber
we
will
not
describe
no
one
even
looks
into
the
ward
except
the
barber
the
patients
are
condemned
to
see
day
after
day
no
one
but
nikita
a
rather
strange
rumour
has
however
been
circulating
in
the
hospital
of
late
it
is
rumoured
that
the
doctor
has
begun
to
visit
ward
no
v
a
strange
rumour
andrey
yefimitch
ragin
is
a
strange
man
in
his
way
they
say
that
when
he
was
young
he
was
very
religious
and
prepared
himself
for
a
clerical
career
and
that
when
he
had
finished
his
studies
at
the
high
school
in
he
intended
to
enter
a
theological
academy
but
that
his
father
a
surgeon
and
doctor
of
medicine
jeered
at
him
and
declared
that
he
would
disown
him
if
he
became
a
priest
how
far
this
is
true
i
do
know
but
andrey
yefimitch
himself
has
more
than
once
confessed
that
he
has
never
had
a
natural
bent
for
medicine
or
science
in
general
however
that
may
have
been
when
he
finished
his
studies
in
the
medical
faculty
he
did
not
enter
the
priesthood
he
showed
no
special
devoutness
and
was
no
more
like
a
priest
at
the
beginning
of
his
medical
career
than
he
is
now
his
exterior
is
heavy
coarse
like
a
peasant
his
face
his
beard
his
flat
hair
and
his
coarse
clumsy
figure
suggest
an
overfed
intemperate
and
harsh
innkeeper
on
the
highroad
his
face
is
and
covered
with
blue
veins
his
eyes
are
little
and
his
nose
is
red
with
his
height
and
broad
shoulders
he
has
huge
hands
and
feet
one
would
think
that
a
blow
from
his
fist
would
knock
the
life
out
of
anyone
but
his
step
is
soft
and
his
walk
is
cautious
and
insinuating
when
he
meets
anyone
in
a
narrow
passage
he
is
always
the
first
to
stop
and
make
way
and
to
say
not
in
a
bass
as
one
would
expect
but
in
a
high
soft
tenor
i
beg
your
pardon
he
has
a
little
swelling
on
his
neck
which
prevents
him
from
wearing
stiff
starched
collars
and
so
he
always
goes
about
in
soft
linen
or
cotton
shirts
altogether
he
does
not
dress
like
a
doctor
he
wears
the
same
suit
for
ten
years
and
the
new
clothes
which
he
usually
buys
at
a
jewish
shop
look
as
shabby
and
crumpled
on
him
as
his
old
ones
he
sees
patients
and
dines
and
pays
visits
all
in
the
same
coat
but
this
is
not
due
to
niggardliness
but
to
complete
carelessness
about
his
appearance
when
andrey
yefimitch
came
to
the
town
to
take
up
his
duties
the
institution
founded
to
the
glory
of
god
was
in
a
terrible
condition
one
could
hardly
breathe
for
the
stench
in
the
wards
in
the
passages
and
in
the
courtyards
of
the
hospital
the
hospital
servants
the
nurses
and
their
children
slept
in
the
wards
together
with
the
patients
they
complained
that
there
was
no
living
for
beetles
bugs
and
mice
the
surgical
wards
were
never
free
from
erysipelas
there
were
only
two
scalpels
and
not
one
thermometer
in
the
whole
hospital
potatoes
were
kept
in
the
baths
the
superintendent
the
housekeeper
and
the
medical
assistant
robbed
the
patients
and
of
the
old
doctor
andrey
yefimitch
predecessor
people
declared
that
he
secretly
sold
the
hospital
alcohol
and
that
he
kept
a
regular
harem
consisting
of
nurses
and
female
patients
these
disorderly
proceedings
were
perfectly
well
known
in
the
town
and
were
even
exaggerated
but
people
took
them
calmly
some
justified
them
on
the
ground
that
there
were
only
peasants
and
working
men
in
the
hospital
who
could
not
be
dissatisfied
since
they
were
much
worse
off
at
home
than
in
the
hospital
they
could
be
fed
on
woodcocks
others
said
in
excuse
that
the
town
alone
without
help
from
the
zemstvo
was
not
equal
to
maintaining
a
good
hospital
thank
god
for
having
one
at
all
even
a
poor
one
and
the
newly
formed
zemstvo
did
not
open
infirmaries
either
in
the
town
or
the
neighbourhood
relying
on
the
fact
that
the
town
already
had
its
hospital
after
looking
over
the
hospital
andrey
yefimitch
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
an
immoral
institution
and
extremely
prejudicial
to
the
health
of
the
townspeople
in
his
opinion
the
most
sensible
thing
that
could
be
done
was
to
let
out
the
patients
and
close
the
hospital
but
he
reflected
that
his
will
alone
was
not
enough
to
do
this
and
that
it
would
be
useless
if
physical
and
moral
impurity
were
driven
out
of
one
place
they
would
only
move
to
another
one
must
wait
for
it
to
wither
away
of
itself
besides
if
people
open
a
hospital
and
put
up
with
having
it
it
must
be
because
they
need
it
superstition
and
all
the
nastiness
and
abominations
of
daily
life
were
necessary
since
in
process
of
time
they
worked
out
to
something
sensible
just
as
manure
turns
into
black
earth
there
was
nothing
on
earth
so
good
that
it
had
not
something
nasty
about
its
first
origin
when
andrey
yefimitch
undertook
his
duties
he
was
apparently
not
greatly
concerned
about
the
irregularities
at
the
hospital
he
only
asked
the
attendants
and
nurses
not
to
sleep
in
the
wards
and
had
two
cupboards
of
instruments
put
up
the
superintendent
the
housekeeper
the
medical
assistant
and
the
erysipelas
remained
unchanged
andrey
yefimitch
loved
intelligence
and
honesty
intensely
but
he
had
no
strength
of
will
nor
belief
in
his
right
to
organize
an
intelligent
and
honest
life
about
him
he
was
absolutely
unable
to
give
orders
to
forbid
things
and
to
insist
it
seemed
as
though
he
had
taken
a
vow
never
to
raise
his
voice
and
never
to
make
use
of
the
imperative
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
say
fetch
or
bring
when
he
wanted
his
meals
he
would
cough
hesitatingly
and
say
to
the
cook
how
about
tea
or
how
about
dinner
to
dismiss
the
superintendent
or
to
tell
him
to
leave
off
stealing
or
to
abolish
the
unnecessary
parasitic
post
altogether
was
absolutely
beyond
his
powers
when
andrey
yefimitch
was
deceived
or
flattered
or
accounts
he
knew
to
be
cooked
were
brought
him
to
sign
he
would
turn
as
red
as
a
crab
and
feel
guilty
but
yet
he
would
sign
the
accounts
when
the
patients
complained
to
him
of
being
hungry
or
of
the
roughness
of
the
nurses
he
would
be
confused
and
mutter
guiltily
very
well
very
well
i
will
go
into
it
later
most
likely
there
is
some
misunderstanding
at
first
andrey
yefimitch
worked
very
zealously
he
saw
patients
every
day
from
morning
till
performed
operations
and
even
attended
confinements
the
ladies
said
of
him
that
he
was
attentive
and
clever
at
diagnosing
diseases
especially
those
of
women
and
children
but
in
process
of
time
the
work
unmistakably
wearied
him
by
its
monotony
and
obvious
uselessness
one
sees
thirty
patients
and
they
have
increased
to
the
next
day
forty
and
so
on
from
day
to
day
from
year
to
year
while
the
mortality
in
the
town
did
not
decrease
and
the
patients
did
not
leave
off
coming
to
be
any
real
help
to
forty
patients
between
morning
and
dinner
was
not
physically
possible
so
it
could
but
lead
to
deception
if
twelve
thousand
patients
were
seen
in
a
year
it
meant
if
one
looked
at
it
simply
that
twelve
thousand
men
were
deceived
to
put
those
who
were
seriously
ill
into
wards
and
to
treat
them
according
to
the
principles
of
science
was
impossible
too
because
though
there
were
principles
there
was
no
science
if
he
were
to
put
aside
philosophy
and
pedantically
follow
the
rules
as
other
doctors
did
the
things
above
all
necessary
were
cleanliness
and
ventilation
instead
of
dirt
wholesome
nourishment
instead
of
broth
made
of
stinking
sour
cabbage
and
good
assistants
instead
of
thieves
and
indeed
why
hinder
people
dying
if
death
is
the
normal
and
legitimate
end
of
everyone
what
is
gained
if
some
or
clerk
lives
an
extra
five
or
ten
years
if
the
aim
of
medicine
is
by
drugs
to
alleviate
suffering
the
question
forces
itself
on
one
why
alleviate
it
in
the
first
place
they
say
that
suffering
leads
man
to
perfection
and
in
the
second
if
mankind
really
learns
to
alleviate
its
sufferings
with
pills
and
drops
it
will
completely
abandon
religion
and
philosophy
in
which
it
has
hitherto
found
not
merely
protection
from
all
sorts
of
trouble
but
even
happiness
pushkin
suffered
terrible
agonies
before
his
death
poor
heine
lay
paralyzed
for
several
years
why
then
should
not
some
andrey
yefimitch
or
matryona
savishna
be
ill
since
their
lives
had
nothing
of
importance
in
them
and
would
have
been
entirely
empty
and
like
the
life
of
an
amoeba
except
for
suffering
oppressed
by
such
reflections
andrey
yefimitch
relaxed
his
efforts
and
gave
up
visiting
the
hospital
every
day
vi
his
life
was
passed
like
this
as
a
rule
he
got
up
at
eight
in
the
morning
dressed
and
drank
his
tea
then
he
sat
down
in
his
study
to
read
or
went
to
the
hospital
at
the
hospital
the
were
sitting
in
the
dark
narrow
little
corridor
waiting
to
be
seen
by
the
doctor
the
nurses
and
the
attendants
tramping
with
their
boots
over
the
brick
floors
ran
by
them
patients
in
passed
dead
bodies
and
vessels
full
of
filth
were
carried
by
the
children
were
crying
and
there
was
a
cold
draught
andrey
yefimitch
knew
that
such
surroundings
were
torture
to
feverish
consumptive
and
impressionable
patients
but
what
could
be
done
in
the
he
was
met
by
his
assistant
sergey
sergeyitch
a
fat
little
man
with
a
plump
shaven
face
with
soft
smooth
manners
wearing
a
new
loosely
cut
suit
and
looking
more
like
a
senator
than
a
medical
assistant
he
had
an
immense
practice
in
the
town
wore
a
white
tie
and
considered
himself
more
proficient
than
the
doctor
who
had
no
practice
in
the
corner
of
the
there
stood
a
large
ikon
in
a
shrine
with
a
heavy
lamp
in
front
of
it
and
near
it
a
with
a
white
cover
on
it
on
the
walls
hung
portraits
of
bishops
a
view
of
the
svyatogorsky
monastery
and
wreaths
of
dried
cornflowers
sergey
sergeyitch
was
religious
and
liked
solemnity
and
decorum
the
ikon
had
been
put
up
at
his
expense
at
his
instructions
some
one
of
the
patients
read
the
hymns
of
praise
in
the
on
sundays
and
after
the
reading
sergey
sergeyitch
himself
went
through
the
wards
with
a
censer
and
burned
incense
there
were
a
great
many
patients
but
the
time
was
short
and
so
the
work
was
confined
to
the
asking
of
a
few
brief
questions
and
the
administration
of
some
drugs
such
as
or
volatile
ointment
andrey
yefimitch
would
sit
with
his
cheek
resting
in
his
hand
lost
in
thought
and
asking
questions
mechanically
sergey
sergeyitch
sat
down
too
rubbing
his
hands
and
from
time
to
time
putting
in
his
word
we
suffer
pain
and
poverty
he
would
say
because
we
do
not
pray
to
the
merciful
god
as
we
should
yes
andrey
yefimitch
never
performed
any
operation
when
he
was
seeing
patients
he
had
long
ago
given
up
doing
so
and
the
sight
of
blood
upset
him
when
he
had
to
open
a
child
mouth
in
order
to
look
at
its
throat
and
the
child
cried
and
tried
to
defend
itself
with
its
little
hands
the
noise
in
his
ears
made
his
head
go
round
and
brought
tears
to
his
eyes
he
would
make
haste
to
prescribe
a
drug
and
motion
to
the
woman
to
take
the
child
away
he
was
soon
wearied
by
the
timidity
of
the
patients
and
their
incoherence
by
the
proximity
of
the
pious
sergey
sergeyitch
by
the
portraits
on
the
walls
and
by
his
own
questions
which
he
had
asked
over
and
over
again
for
twenty
years
and
he
would
go
away
after
seeing
five
or
six
patients
the
rest
would
be
seen
by
his
assistant
in
his
absence
with
the
agreeable
thought
that
thank
god
he
had
no
private
practice
now
and
that
no
one
would
interrupt
him
andrey
yefimitch
sat
down
to
the
table
immediately
on
reaching
home
and
took
up
a
book
he
read
a
great
deal
and
always
with
enjoyment
half
his
salary
went
on
buying
books
and
of
the
six
rooms
that
made
up
his
abode
three
were
heaped
up
with
books
and
old
magazines
he
liked
best
of
all
works
on
history
and
philosophy
the
only
medical
publication
to
which
he
subscribed
was
of
which
he
always
read
the
last
pages
first
he
would
always
go
on
reading
for
several
hours
without
a
break
and
without
being
weary
he
did
not
read
as
rapidly
and
impulsively
as
ivan
dmitritch
had
done
in
the
past
but
slowly
and
with
concentration
often
pausing
over
a
passage
which
he
liked
or
did
not
find
intelligible
near
the
books
there
always
stood
a
decanter
of
vodka
and
a
salted
cucumber
or
a
pickled
apple
lay
beside
it
not
on
a
plate
but
on
the
baize
every
he
would
pour
himself
out
a
glass
of
vodka
and
drink
it
without
taking
his
eyes
off
the
book
then
without
looking
at
it
he
would
feel
for
the
cucumber
and
bite
off
a
bit
at
three
he
would
go
cautiously
to
the
kitchen
door
cough
and
say
daryushka
what
about
dinner
after
his
dinner
a
rather
poor
and
untidily
served
one
andrey
yefimitch
would
walk
up
and
down
his
rooms
with
his
arms
folded
thinking
the
clock
would
strike
four
then
five
and
still
he
would
be
walking
up
and
down
thinking
occasionally
the
kitchen
door
would
creak
and
the
red
and
sleepy
face
of
daryushka
would
appear
andrey
yefimitch
is
it
time
for
you
to
have
your
beer
she
would
ask
anxiously
no
it
not
time
yet
he
would
answer
i
wait
a
little
i
wait
a
little
towards
the
evening
the
postmaster
mihail
averyanitch
the
only
man
in
town
whose
society
did
not
bore
andrey
yefimitch
would
come
in
mihail
averyanitch
had
once
been
a
very
rich
landowner
and
had
served
in
the
calvary
but
had
come
to
ruin
and
was
forced
by
poverty
to
take
a
job
in
the
post
office
late
in
life
he
had
a
hale
and
hearty
appearance
luxuriant
grey
whiskers
the
manners
of
a
man
and
a
loud
pleasant
voice
he
was
and
emotional
but
when
anyone
in
the
post
office
made
a
protest
expressed
disagreement
or
even
began
to
argue
mihail
averyanitch
would
turn
crimson
shake
all
over
and
shout
in
a
voice
of
thunder
hold
your
tongue
so
that
the
post
office
had
long
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
an
institution
which
it
was
terrible
to
visit
mihail
averyanitch
liked
and
respected
andrey
yefimitch
for
his
culture
and
the
loftiness
of
his
soul
he
treated
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
town
superciliously
as
though
they
were
his
subordinates
here
i
am
he
would
say
going
in
to
andrey
yefimitch
good
evening
my
dear
fellow
i
be
bound
you
are
getting
sick
of
me
are
you
on
the
contrary
i
am
delighted
said
the
doctor
i
am
always
glad
to
see
you
the
friends
would
sit
on
the
sofa
in
the
study
and
for
some
time
would
smoke
in
silence
daryushka
what
about
the
beer
andrey
yefimitch
would
say
they
would
drink
their
first
bottle
still
in
silence
the
doctor
brooding
and
mihail
averyanitch
with
a
gay
and
animated
face
like
a
man
who
has
something
very
interesting
to
tell
the
doctor
was
always
the
one
to
begin
the
conversation
what
a
pity
he
would
say
quietly
and
slowly
not
looking
his
friend
in
the
face
he
never
looked
anyone
in
the
face
what
a
great
pity
it
is
that
there
are
no
people
in
our
town
who
are
capable
of
carrying
on
intelligent
and
interesting
conversation
or
care
to
do
so
it
is
an
immense
privation
for
us
even
the
educated
class
do
not
rise
above
vulgarity
the
level
of
their
development
i
assure
you
is
not
a
bit
higher
than
that
of
the
lower
orders
perfectly
true
i
agree
you
know
of
course
the
doctor
went
on
quietly
and
deliberately
that
everything
in
this
world
is
insignificant
and
uninteresting
except
the
higher
spiritual
manifestations
of
the
human
mind
intellect
draws
a
sharp
line
between
the
animals
and
man
suggests
the
divinity
of
the
latter
and
to
some
extent
even
takes
the
place
of
the
immortality
which
does
not
exist
consequently
the
intellect
is
the
only
possible
source
of
enjoyment
we
see
and
hear
of
no
trace
of
intellect
about
us
so
we
are
deprived
of
enjoyment
we
have
books
it
is
true
but
that
is
not
at
all
the
same
as
living
talk
and
converse
if
you
will
allow
me
to
make
a
not
quite
apt
comparison
books
are
the
printed
score
while
talk
is
the
singing
perfectly
true
a
silence
would
follow
daryushka
would
come
out
of
the
kitchen
and
with
an
expression
of
blank
dejection
would
stand
in
the
doorway
to
listen
with
her
face
propped
on
her
fist
eh
mihail
averyanitch
would
sigh
to
expect
intelligence
of
this
generation
and
he
would
describe
how
wholesome
entertaining
and
interesting
life
had
been
in
the
past
how
intelligent
the
educated
class
in
russia
used
to
be
and
what
lofty
ideas
it
had
of
honour
and
friendship
how
they
used
to
lend
money
without
an
iou
and
it
was
thought
a
disgrace
not
to
give
a
helping
hand
to
a
comrade
in
need
and
what
campaigns
what
adventures
what
skirmishes
what
comrades
what
women
and
the
caucasus
what
a
marvellous
country
the
wife
of
a
battalion
commander
a
queer
woman
used
to
put
on
an
uniform
and
drive
off
into
the
mountains
in
the
evening
alone
without
a
guide
it
was
said
that
she
had
a
love
affair
with
some
princeling
in
the
native
village
queen
of
heaven
holy
mother
daryushka
would
sigh
and
how
we
drank
and
how
we
ate
and
what
desperate
liberals
we
were
andrey
yefimitch
would
listen
without
hearing
he
was
musing
as
he
sipped
his
beer
i
often
dream
of
intellectual
people
and
conversation
with
them
he
said
suddenly
interrupting
mihail
averyanitch
my
father
gave
me
an
excellent
education
but
under
the
influence
of
the
ideas
of
the
sixties
made
me
become
a
doctor
i
believe
if
i
had
not
obeyed
him
then
by
now
i
should
have
been
in
the
very
centre
of
the
intellectual
movement
most
likely
i
should
have
become
a
member
of
some
university
of
course
intellect
too
is
transient
and
not
eternal
but
you
know
why
i
cherish
a
partiality
for
it
life
is
a
vexatious
trap
when
a
thinking
man
reaches
maturity
and
attains
to
full
consciousness
he
can
not
help
feeling
that
he
is
in
a
trap
from
which
there
is
no
escape
indeed
he
is
summoned
without
his
choice
by
fortuitous
circumstances
from
into
life
what
for
he
tries
to
find
out
the
meaning
and
object
of
his
existence
he
is
told
nothing
or
he
is
told
absurdities
he
knocks
and
it
is
not
opened
to
him
death
comes
to
him
also
without
his
choice
and
so
just
as
in
prison
men
held
together
by
common
misfortune
feel
more
at
ease
when
they
are
together
so
one
does
not
notice
the
trap
in
life
when
people
with
a
bent
for
analysis
and
generalization
meet
together
and
pass
their
time
in
the
interchange
of
proud
and
free
ideas
in
that
sense
the
intellect
is
the
source
of
an
enjoyment
nothing
can
replace
perfectly
true
not
looking
his
friend
in
the
face
andrey
yefimitch
would
go
on
quietly
and
with
pauses
talking
about
intellectual
people
and
conversation
with
them
and
mihail
averyanitch
would
listen
attentively
and
agree
perfectly
true
and
you
do
not
believe
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
he
would
ask
suddenly
no
honoured
mihail
averyanitch
i
do
not
believe
it
and
have
no
grounds
for
believing
it
i
must
own
i
doubt
it
too
and
yet
i
have
a
feeling
as
though
i
should
never
die
oh
i
think
to
myself
fogey
it
is
time
you
were
dead
but
there
is
a
little
voice
in
my
soul
says
believe
it
you
wo
die
soon
after
nine
mihail
averyanitch
would
go
away
as
he
put
on
his
fur
coat
in
the
entry
he
would
say
with
a
sigh
what
a
wilderness
fate
has
carried
us
to
though
really
most
vexatious
of
all
is
to
have
to
die
here
ech
vii
after
seeing
his
friend
out
andrey
yefimitch
would
sit
down
at
the
table
and
begin
reading
again
the
stillness
of
the
evening
and
afterwards
of
the
night
was
not
broken
by
a
single
sound
and
it
seemed
as
though
time
were
standing
still
and
brooding
with
the
doctor
over
the
book
and
as
though
there
were
nothing
in
existence
but
the
books
and
the
lamp
with
the
green
shade
the
doctor
coarse
face
was
gradually
lighted
up
by
a
smile
of
delight
and
enthusiasm
over
the
progress
of
the
human
intellect
oh
why
is
not
man
immortal
he
thought
what
is
the
good
of
the
brain
centres
and
convolutions
what
is
the
good
of
sight
speech
genius
if
it
is
all
destined
to
depart
into
the
soil
and
in
the
end
to
grow
cold
together
with
the
crust
and
then
for
millions
of
years
to
fly
with
the
earth
round
the
sun
with
no
meaning
and
no
object
to
do
that
there
was
no
need
at
all
to
draw
man
with
his
lofty
almost
godlike
intellect
out
of
and
then
as
though
in
mockery
to
turn
him
into
clay
the
transmutation
of
substances
but
what
cowardice
to
comfort
oneself
with
that
cheap
substitute
for
immortality
the
unconscious
processes
that
take
place
in
nature
are
lower
even
than
the
stupidity
of
man
since
in
stupidity
there
is
anyway
consciousness
and
will
while
in
those
processes
there
is
absolutely
nothing
only
the
coward
who
has
more
fear
of
death
than
dignity
can
comfort
himself
with
the
fact
that
his
body
will
in
time
live
again
in
the
grass
in
the
stones
in
the
toad
to
find
one
immortality
in
the
transmutation
of
substances
is
as
strange
as
to
prophesy
a
brilliant
future
for
the
case
after
a
precious
violin
has
been
broken
and
become
useless
when
the
clock
struck
andrey
yefimitch
would
sink
back
into
his
chair
and
close
his
eyes
to
think
a
little
and
under
the
influence
of
the
fine
ideas
of
which
he
had
been
reading
he
would
unawares
recall
his
past
and
his
present
the
past
was
hateful
better
not
to
think
of
it
and
it
was
the
same
in
the
present
as
in
the
past
he
knew
that
at
the
very
time
when
his
thoughts
were
floating
together
with
the
cooling
earth
round
the
sun
in
the
main
building
beside
his
abode
people
were
suffering
in
sickness
and
physical
impurity
someone
perhaps
could
not
sleep
and
was
making
war
upon
the
insects
someone
was
being
infected
by
erysipelas
or
moaning
over
too
tight
a
bandage
perhaps
the
patients
were
playing
cards
with
the
nurses
and
drinking
vodka
according
to
the
yearly
return
twelve
thousand
people
had
been
deceived
the
whole
hospital
rested
as
it
had
done
twenty
years
ago
on
thieving
filth
scandals
gossip
on
gross
quackery
and
as
before
it
was
an
immoral
institution
extremely
injurious
to
the
health
of
the
inhabitants
he
knew
that
nikita
knocked
the
patients
about
behind
the
barred
windows
of
ward
no
and
that
moiseika
went
about
the
town
every
day
begging
alms
on
the
other
hand
he
knew
very
well
that
a
magical
change
had
taken
place
in
medicine
during
the
last
years
when
he
was
studying
at
the
university
he
had
fancied
that
medicine
would
soon
be
overtaken
by
the
fate
of
alchemy
and
metaphysics
but
now
when
he
was
reading
at
night
the
science
of
medicine
touched
him
and
excited
his
wonder
and
even
enthusiasm
what
unexpected
brilliance
what
a
revolution
thanks
to
the
antiseptic
system
operations
were
performed
such
as
the
great
pirogov
had
considered
impossible
even
ordinary
zemstvo
doctors
were
venturing
to
perform
the
resection
of
the
kneecap
of
abdominal
operations
only
one
per
cent
was
fatal
while
stone
was
considered
such
a
trifle
that
they
did
not
even
write
about
it
a
radical
cure
for
syphilis
had
been
discovered
and
the
theory
of
heredity
hypnotism
the
discoveries
of
pasteur
and
of
koch
hygiene
based
on
statistics
and
the
work
of
zemstvo
doctors
psychiatry
with
its
modern
classification
of
mental
diseases
methods
of
diagnosis
and
treatment
was
a
perfect
elborus
in
comparison
with
what
had
been
in
the
past
they
no
longer
poured
cold
water
on
the
heads
of
lunatics
nor
put
upon
them
they
treated
them
with
humanity
and
even
so
it
was
stated
in
the
papers
got
up
balls
and
entertainments
for
them
andrey
yefimitch
knew
that
with
modern
tastes
and
views
such
an
abomination
as
ward
no
was
possible
only
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
a
railway
in
a
little
town
where
the
mayor
and
all
the
town
council
were
tradesmen
who
looked
upon
the
doctor
as
an
oracle
who
must
be
believed
without
any
criticism
even
if
he
had
poured
molten
lead
into
their
mouths
in
any
other
place
the
public
and
the
newspapers
would
long
ago
have
torn
this
little
bastille
to
pieces
but
after
all
what
of
it
andrey
yefimitch
would
ask
himself
opening
his
eyes
there
is
the
antiseptic
system
there
is
koch
there
is
pasteur
but
the
essential
reality
is
not
altered
a
bit
and
mortality
are
still
the
same
they
get
up
balls
and
entertainments
for
the
mad
but
still
they
do
let
them
go
free
so
it
all
nonsense
and
vanity
and
there
is
no
difference
in
reality
between
the
best
vienna
clinic
and
my
hospital
but
depression
and
a
feeling
akin
to
envy
prevented
him
from
feeling
indifferent
it
must
have
been
owing
to
exhaustion
his
heavy
head
sank
on
to
the
book
he
put
his
hands
under
his
face
to
make
it
softer
and
thought
i
serve
in
a
pernicious
institution
and
receive
a
salary
from
people
whom
i
am
deceiving
i
am
not
honest
but
then
i
of
myself
am
nothing
i
am
only
part
of
an
inevitable
social
evil
all
local
officials
are
pernicious
and
receive
their
salary
for
doing
nothing
and
so
for
my
dishonesty
it
is
not
i
who
am
to
blame
but
the
times
if
i
had
been
born
two
hundred
years
later
i
should
have
been
different
when
it
struck
three
he
would
put
out
his
lamp
and
go
into
his
bedroom
he
was
not
sleepy
viii
two
years
before
the
zemstvo
in
a
liberal
mood
had
decided
to
allow
three
hundred
roubles
a
year
to
pay
for
additional
medical
service
in
the
town
till
the
zemstvo
hospital
should
be
opened
and
the
district
doctor
yevgeny
fyodoritch
hobotov
was
invited
to
the
town
to
assist
andrey
yefimitch
he
was
a
very
young
man
not
yet
thirty
tall
and
dark
with
broad
and
little
eyes
his
forefathers
had
probably
come
from
one
of
the
many
alien
races
of
russia
he
arrived
in
the
town
without
a
farthing
with
a
small
portmanteau
and
a
plain
young
woman
whom
he
called
his
cook
this
woman
had
a
baby
at
the
breast
yevgeny
fyodoritch
used
to
go
about
in
a
cap
with
a
peak
and
in
high
boots
and
in
the
winter
wore
a
sheepskin
he
made
great
friends
with
sergey
sergeyitch
the
medical
assistant
and
with
the
treasurer
but
held
aloof
from
the
other
officials
and
for
some
reason
called
them
aristocrats
he
had
only
one
book
in
his
lodgings
the
latest
prescriptions
of
the
vienna
clinic
for
when
he
went
to
a
patient
he
always
took
this
book
with
him
he
played
billiards
in
the
evening
at
the
club
he
did
not
like
cards
he
was
very
fond
of
using
in
conversation
such
expressions
as
endless
bobbery
canting
soft
soap
shut
up
with
your
finicking
he
visited
the
hospital
twice
a
week
made
the
round
of
the
wards
and
saw
the
complete
absence
of
antiseptic
treatment
and
the
cupping
roused
his
indignation
but
he
did
not
introduce
any
new
system
being
afraid
of
offending
andrey
yefimitch
he
regarded
his
colleague
as
a
sly
old
rascal
suspected
him
of
being
a
man
of
large
means
and
secretly
envied
him
he
would
have
been
very
glad
to
have
his
post
ix
on
a
spring
evening
towards
the
end
of
march
when
there
was
no
snow
left
on
the
ground
and
the
starlings
were
singing
in
the
hospital
garden
the
doctor
went
out
to
see
his
friend
the
postmaster
as
far
as
the
gate
at
that
very
moment
the
jew
moiseika
returning
with
his
booty
came
into
the
yard
he
had
no
cap
on
and
his
bare
feet
were
thrust
into
goloshes
in
his
hand
he
had
a
little
bag
of
coppers
give
me
a
kopeck
he
said
to
the
doctor
smiling
and
shivering
with
cold
andrey
yefimitch
who
could
never
refuse
anyone
anything
gave
him
a
piece
how
bad
that
is
he
thought
looking
at
the
jew
bare
feet
with
their
thin
red
ankles
why
it
wet
and
stirred
by
a
feeling
akin
both
to
pity
and
disgust
he
went
into
the
lodge
behind
the
jew
looking
now
at
his
bald
head
now
at
his
ankles
as
the
doctor
went
in
nikita
jumped
up
from
his
heap
of
litter
and
stood
at
attention
nikita
andrey
yefimitch
said
mildly
that
jew
should
be
provided
with
boots
or
something
he
will
catch
cold
certainly
your
honour
i
inform
the
superintendent
please
do
ask
him
in
my
name
tell
him
that
i
asked
the
door
into
the
ward
was
open
ivan
dmitritch
lying
propped
on
his
elbow
on
the
bed
listened
in
alarm
to
the
unfamiliar
voice
and
suddenly
recognized
the
doctor
he
trembled
all
over
with
anger
jumped
up
and
with
a
red
and
wrathful
face
with
his
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
ran
out
into
the
middle
of
the
road
the
doctor
has
come
he
shouted
and
broke
into
a
laugh
at
last
gentlemen
i
congratulate
you
the
doctor
is
honouring
us
with
a
visit
cursed
reptile
he
shrieked
and
stamped
in
a
frenzy
such
as
had
never
been
seen
in
the
ward
before
kill
the
reptile
no
killing
too
good
drown
him
in
the
andrey
yefimitch
hearing
this
looked
into
the
ward
from
the
entry
and
asked
gently
what
for
what
for
shouted
ivan
dmitritch
going
up
to
him
with
a
menacing
air
and
convulsively
wrapping
himself
in
his
what
for
thief
he
said
with
a
look
of
repulsion
moving
his
lips
as
though
he
would
spit
at
him
quack
hangman
calm
yourself
said
andrey
yefimitch
smiling
guiltily
i
assure
you
i
have
never
stolen
anything
and
as
to
the
rest
most
likely
you
greatly
exaggerate
i
see
you
are
angry
with
me
calm
yourself
i
beg
if
you
can
and
tell
me
coolly
what
are
you
angry
for
what
are
you
keeping
me
here
for
because
you
are
yes
i
am
ill
but
you
know
dozens
hundreds
of
madmen
are
walking
about
in
freedom
because
your
ignorance
is
incapable
of
distinguishing
them
from
the
sane
why
am
i
and
these
poor
wretches
to
be
shut
up
here
like
scapegoats
for
all
the
rest
you
your
assistant
the
superintendent
and
all
your
hospital
rabble
are
immeasurably
inferior
to
every
one
of
us
morally
why
then
are
we
shut
up
and
you
not
where
the
logic
of
it
morality
and
logic
do
come
in
it
all
depends
on
chance
if
anyone
is
shut
up
he
has
to
stay
and
if
anyone
is
not
shut
up
he
can
walk
about
that
all
there
is
neither
morality
nor
logic
in
my
being
a
doctor
and
your
being
a
mental
patient
there
is
nothing
but
idle
chance
that
twaddle
i
do
understand
ivan
dmitritch
brought
out
in
a
hollow
voice
and
he
sat
down
on
his
bed
moiseika
whom
nikita
did
not
venture
to
search
in
the
presence
of
the
doctor
laid
out
on
his
bed
pieces
of
bread
bits
of
paper
and
little
bones
and
still
shivering
with
cold
began
rapidly
in
a
singsong
voice
saying
something
in
yiddish
he
most
likely
imagined
that
he
had
opened
a
shop
let
me
out
said
ivan
dmitritch
and
his
voice
quivered
i
can
not
but
why
why
because
it
is
not
in
my
power
think
what
use
will
it
be
to
you
if
i
do
let
you
out
go
the
townspeople
or
the
police
will
detain
you
or
bring
you
back
yes
yes
that
true
said
ivan
dmitritch
and
he
rubbed
his
forehead
it
awful
but
what
am
i
to
do
what
andrey
yefimitch
liked
ivan
dmitritch
voice
and
his
intelligent
young
face
with
its
grimaces
he
longed
to
be
kind
to
the
young
man
and
soothe
him
he
sat
down
on
the
bed
beside
him
thought
and
said
you
ask
me
what
to
do
the
very
best
thing
in
your
position
would
be
to
run
away
but
unhappily
that
is
useless
you
would
be
taken
up
when
society
protects
itself
from
the
criminal
mentally
deranged
or
otherwise
inconvenient
people
it
is
invincible
there
is
only
one
thing
left
for
you
to
resign
yourself
to
the
thought
that
your
presence
here
is
inevitable
it
is
no
use
to
anyone
so
long
as
prisons
and
madhouses
exist
someone
must
be
shut
up
in
them
if
not
you
i
if
not
i
some
third
person
wait
till
in
the
distant
future
prisons
and
madhouses
no
longer
exist
and
there
will
be
neither
bars
on
the
windows
nor
hospital
gowns
of
course
that
time
will
come
sooner
or
later
ivan
dmitritch
smiled
ironically
you
are
jesting
he
said
screwing
up
his
eyes
such
gentlemen
as
you
and
your
assistant
nikita
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
future
but
you
may
be
sure
sir
better
days
will
come
i
may
express
myself
cheaply
you
may
laugh
but
the
dawn
of
a
new
life
is
at
hand
truth
and
justice
will
triumph
and
our
turn
will
come
i
shall
not
live
to
see
it
i
shall
perish
but
some
will
see
it
i
greet
them
with
all
my
heart
and
rejoice
rejoice
with
them
onward
god
be
your
help
friends
with
shining
eyes
ivan
dmitritch
got
up
and
stretching
his
hands
towards
the
window
went
on
with
emotion
in
his
voice
from
behind
these
bars
i
bless
you
hurrah
for
truth
and
justice
i
rejoice
i
see
no
particular
reason
to
rejoice
said
andrey
yefimitch
who
thought
ivan
dmitritch
movement
theatrical
though
he
was
delighted
by
it
prisons
and
madhouses
there
will
not
be
and
truth
as
you
have
just
expressed
it
will
triumph
but
the
reality
of
things
you
know
will
not
change
the
laws
of
nature
will
still
remain
the
same
people
will
suffer
pain
grow
old
and
die
just
as
they
do
now
however
magnificent
a
dawn
lighted
up
your
life
you
would
yet
in
the
end
be
nailed
up
in
a
coffin
and
thrown
into
a
hole
and
immortality
oh
come
now
you
do
believe
in
it
but
i
do
somebody
in
dostoevsky
or
voltaire
said
that
if
there
had
not
been
a
god
men
would
have
invented
him
and
i
firmly
believe
that
if
there
is
no
immortality
the
great
intellect
of
man
will
sooner
or
later
invent
it
well
said
observed
andrey
yefimitch
smiling
with
pleasure
its
a
good
thing
you
have
faith
with
such
a
belief
one
may
live
happily
even
shut
up
within
walls
you
have
studied
somewhere
i
presume
yes
i
have
been
at
the
university
but
did
not
complete
my
studies
you
are
a
reflecting
and
a
thoughtful
man
in
any
surroundings
you
can
find
tranquillity
in
yourself
free
and
deep
thinking
which
strives
for
the
comprehension
of
life
and
complete
contempt
for
the
foolish
bustle
of
the
world
those
are
two
blessings
beyond
any
that
man
has
ever
known
and
you
can
possess
them
even
though
you
lived
behind
threefold
bars
diogenes
lived
in
a
tub
yet
he
was
happier
than
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
your
diogenes
was
a
blockhead
said
ivan
dmitritch
morosely
why
do
you
talk
to
me
about
diogenes
and
some
foolish
comprehension
of
life
he
cried
growing
suddenly
angry
and
leaping
up
i
love
life
i
love
it
passionately
i
have
the
mania
of
persecution
a
continual
agonizing
terror
but
i
have
moments
when
i
am
overwhelmed
by
the
thirst
for
life
and
then
i
am
afraid
of
going
mad
i
want
dreadfully
to
live
dreadfully
he
walked
up
and
down
the
ward
in
agitation
and
said
dropping
his
voice
when
i
dream
i
am
haunted
by
phantoms
people
come
to
me
i
hear
voices
and
music
and
i
fancy
i
am
walking
through
woods
or
by
the
seashore
and
i
long
so
passionately
for
movement
for
interests
come
tell
me
what
news
is
there
asked
ivan
dmitritch
what
happening
do
you
wish
to
know
about
the
town
or
in
general
well
tell
me
first
about
the
town
and
then
in
general
well
in
the
town
it
is
appallingly
dull
there
no
one
to
say
a
word
to
no
one
to
listen
to
there
are
no
new
people
a
young
doctor
called
hobotov
has
come
here
recently
he
had
come
in
my
time
well
he
is
a
low
cad
is
he
yes
he
is
a
man
of
no
culture
it
strange
you
know
judging
by
every
sign
there
is
no
intellectual
stagnation
in
our
capital
cities
there
is
a
movement
so
there
must
be
real
people
there
too
but
for
some
reason
they
always
send
us
such
men
as
i
would
rather
not
see
it
an
unlucky
town
yes
it
is
an
unlucky
town
sighed
ivan
dmitritch
and
he
laughed
and
how
are
things
in
general
what
are
they
writing
in
the
papers
and
reviews
it
was
by
now
dark
in
the
ward
the
doctor
got
up
and
standing
began
to
describe
what
was
being
written
abroad
and
in
russia
and
the
tendency
of
thought
that
could
be
noticed
now
ivan
dmitritch
listened
attentively
and
put
questions
but
suddenly
as
though
recalling
something
terrible
clutched
at
his
head
and
lay
down
on
the
bed
with
his
back
to
the
doctor
what
the
matter
asked
andrey
yefimitch
you
will
not
hear
another
word
from
me
said
ivan
dmitritch
rudely
leave
me
alone
why
so
i
tell
you
leave
me
alone
why
the
devil
do
you
persist
andrey
yefimitch
shrugged
his
shoulders
heaved
a
sigh
and
went
out
as
he
crossed
the
entry
he
said
you
might
clear
up
here
nikita
there
an
awfully
stuffy
smell
certainly
your
honour
what
an
agreeable
young
man
thought
andrey
yefimitch
going
back
to
his
flat
in
all
the
years
i
have
been
living
here
i
do
believe
he
is
the
first
i
have
met
with
whom
one
can
talk
he
is
capable
of
reasoning
and
is
interested
in
just
the
right
things
while
he
was
reading
and
afterwards
while
he
was
going
to
bed
he
kept
thinking
about
ivan
dmitritch
and
when
he
woke
next
morning
he
remembered
that
he
had
the
day
before
made
the
acquaintance
of
an
intelligent
and
interesting
man
and
determined
to
visit
him
again
as
soon
as
possible
x
ivan
dmitritch
was
lying
in
the
same
position
as
on
the
previous
day
with
his
head
clutched
in
both
hands
and
his
legs
drawn
up
his
face
was
not
visible
my
friend
said
andrey
yefimitch
you
are
not
asleep
are
you
in
the
first
place
i
am
not
your
friend
ivan
dmitritch
articulated
into
the
pillow
and
in
the
second
your
efforts
are
useless
you
will
not
get
one
word
out
of
me
strange
muttered
andrey
yefimitch
in
confusion
yesterday
we
talked
peacefully
but
suddenly
for
some
reason
you
took
offence
and
broke
off
all
at
once
probably
i
expressed
myself
awkwardly
or
perhaps
gave
utterance
to
some
idea
which
did
not
fit
in
with
your
convictions
yes
a
likely
idea
said
ivan
dmitritch
sitting
up
and
looking
at
the
doctor
with
irony
and
uneasiness
his
eyes
were
red
you
can
go
and
spy
and
probe
somewhere
else
it
no
use
your
doing
it
here
i
knew
yesterday
what
you
had
come
for
a
strange
fancy
laughed
the
doctor
so
you
suppose
me
to
be
a
spy
yes
i
do
a
spy
or
a
doctor
who
has
been
charged
to
test
me
it
all
the
same
oh
excuse
me
what
a
queer
fellow
you
are
really
the
doctor
sat
down
on
the
stool
near
the
bed
and
shook
his
head
reproachfully
but
let
us
suppose
you
are
right
he
said
let
us
suppose
that
i
am
treacherously
trying
to
trap
you
into
saying
something
so
as
to
betray
you
to
the
police
you
would
be
arrested
and
then
tried
but
would
you
be
any
worse
off
being
tried
and
in
prison
than
you
are
here
if
you
are
banished
to
a
settlement
or
even
sent
to
penal
servitude
would
it
be
worse
than
being
shut
up
in
this
ward
i
imagine
it
would
be
no
worse
what
then
are
you
afraid
of
these
words
evidently
had
an
effect
on
ivan
dmitritch
he
sat
down
quietly
it
was
between
four
and
five
in
the
afternoon
the
time
when
andrey
yefimitch
usually
walked
up
and
down
his
rooms
and
daryushka
asked
whether
it
was
not
time
for
his
beer
it
was
a
still
bright
day
i
came
out
for
a
walk
after
dinner
and
here
i
have
come
as
you
see
said
the
doctor
it
is
quite
spring
what
month
is
it
march
asked
ivan
dmitritch
yes
the
end
of
march
is
it
very
muddy
no
not
very
there
are
already
paths
in
the
garden
it
would
be
nice
now
to
drive
in
an
open
carriage
somewhere
into
the
country
said
ivan
dmitritch
rubbing
his
red
eyes
as
though
he
were
just
awake
then
to
come
home
to
a
warm
snug
study
and
and
to
have
a
decent
doctor
to
cure
one
headache
it
so
long
since
i
have
lived
like
a
human
being
it
disgusting
here
insufferably
disgusting
after
his
excitement
of
the
previous
day
he
was
exhausted
and
listless
and
spoke
unwillingly
his
fingers
twitched
and
from
his
face
it
could
be
seen
that
he
had
a
splitting
headache
there
is
no
real
difference
between
a
warm
snug
study
and
this
ward
said
andrey
yefimitch
a
man
peace
and
contentment
do
not
lie
outside
a
man
but
in
himself
what
do
you
mean
the
ordinary
man
looks
for
good
and
evil
in
external
things
that
is
in
carriages
in
studies
but
a
thinking
man
looks
for
it
in
himself
you
should
go
and
preach
that
philosophy
in
greece
where
warm
and
fragrant
with
the
scent
of
pomegranates
but
here
it
is
not
suited
to
the
climate
with
whom
was
it
i
was
talking
of
diogenes
was
it
with
you
yes
with
me
yesterday
diogenes
did
not
need
a
study
or
a
warm
habitation
it
hot
there
without
you
can
lie
in
your
tub
and
eat
oranges
and
olives
but
bring
him
to
russia
to
live
he
be
begging
to
be
let
indoors
in
may
let
alone
december
he
be
doubled
up
with
the
cold
no
one
can
be
insensible
to
cold
as
to
every
other
pain
marcus
aurelius
says
pain
is
a
vivid
idea
of
pain
make
an
effort
of
will
to
change
that
idea
dismiss
it
cease
to
complain
and
the
pain
will
disappear
that
is
true
the
wise
man
or
simply
the
reflecting
thoughtful
man
is
distinguished
precisely
by
his
contempt
for
suffering
he
is
always
contented
and
surprised
at
nothing
then
i
am
an
idiot
since
i
suffer
and
am
discontented
and
surprised
at
the
baseness
of
mankind
you
are
wrong
in
that
if
you
will
reflect
more
on
the
subject
you
will
understand
how
insignificant
is
all
that
external
world
that
agitates
us
one
must
strive
for
the
comprehension
of
life
and
in
that
is
true
happiness
comprehension
repeated
ivan
dmitritch
frowning
external
internal
excuse
me
but
i
do
understand
it
i
only
know
he
said
getting
up
and
looking
angrily
at
the
doctor
i
only
know
that
god
has
created
me
of
warm
blood
and
nerves
yes
indeed
if
organic
tissue
is
capable
of
life
it
must
react
to
every
stimulus
and
i
do
to
pain
i
respond
with
tears
and
outcries
to
baseness
with
indignation
to
filth
with
loathing
to
my
mind
that
is
just
what
is
called
life
the
lower
the
organism
the
less
sensitive
it
is
and
the
more
feebly
it
reacts
to
stimulus
and
the
higher
it
is
the
more
responsively
and
vigorously
it
reacts
to
reality
how
is
it
you
do
know
that
a
doctor
and
not
know
such
trifles
to
despise
suffering
to
be
always
contented
and
to
be
surprised
at
nothing
one
must
reach
this
condition
and
ivan
dmitritch
pointed
to
the
peasant
who
was
a
mass
of
fat
or
to
harden
oneself
by
suffering
to
such
a
point
that
one
loses
all
sensibility
to
it
that
is
in
other
words
to
cease
to
live
you
must
excuse
me
i
am
not
a
sage
or
a
philosopher
ivan
dmitritch
continued
with
irritation
and
i
do
understand
anything
about
it
i
am
not
capable
of
reasoning
on
the
contrary
your
reasoning
is
excellent
the
stoics
whom
you
are
parodying
were
remarkable
people
but
their
doctrine
crystallized
two
thousand
years
ago
and
has
not
advanced
and
will
not
advance
an
inch
forward
since
it
is
not
practical
or
living
it
had
a
success
only
with
the
minority
which
spends
its
life
in
savouring
all
sorts
of
theories
and
ruminating
over
them
the
majority
did
not
understand
it
a
doctrine
which
advocates
indifference
to
wealth
and
to
the
comforts
of
life
and
a
contempt
for
suffering
and
death
is
quite
unintelligible
to
the
vast
majority
of
men
since
that
majority
has
never
known
wealth
or
the
comforts
of
life
and
to
despise
suffering
would
mean
to
it
despising
life
itself
since
the
whole
existence
of
man
is
made
up
of
the
sensations
of
hunger
cold
injury
and
a
dread
of
death
the
whole
of
life
lies
in
these
sensations
one
may
be
oppressed
by
it
one
may
hate
it
but
one
can
not
despise
it
yes
so
i
repeat
the
doctrine
of
the
stoics
can
never
have
a
future
from
the
beginning
of
time
up
to
you
see
continually
increasing
the
struggle
the
sensibility
to
pain
the
capacity
of
responding
to
stimulus
ivan
dmitritch
suddenly
lost
the
thread
of
his
thoughts
stopped
and
rubbed
his
forehead
with
vexation
i
meant
to
say
something
important
but
i
have
lost
it
he
said
what
was
i
saying
oh
yes
this
is
what
i
mean
one
of
the
stoics
sold
himself
into
slavery
to
redeem
his
neighbour
so
you
see
even
a
stoic
did
react
to
stimulus
since
for
such
a
generous
act
as
the
destruction
of
oneself
for
the
sake
of
one
neighbour
he
must
have
had
a
soul
capable
of
pity
and
indignation
here
in
prison
i
have
forgotten
everything
i
have
learned
or
else
i
could
have
recalled
something
else
take
christ
for
instance
christ
responded
to
reality
by
weeping
smiling
being
sorrowful
and
moved
to
wrath
even
overcome
by
misery
he
did
not
go
to
meet
his
sufferings
with
a
smile
he
did
not
despise
death
but
prayed
in
the
garden
of
gethsemane
that
this
cup
might
pass
him
by
ivan
dmitritch
laughed
and
sat
down
granted
that
a
man
peace
and
contentment
lie
not
outside
but
in
himself
he
said
granted
that
one
must
despise
suffering
and
not
be
surprised
at
anything
yet
on
what
ground
do
you
preach
the
theory
are
you
a
sage
a
philosopher
no
i
am
not
a
philosopher
but
everyone
ought
to
preach
it
because
it
is
reasonable
no
i
want
to
know
how
it
is
that
you
consider
yourself
competent
to
judge
of
contempt
for
suffering
and
so
on
have
you
ever
suffered
have
you
any
idea
of
suffering
allow
me
to
ask
you
were
you
ever
thrashed
in
your
childhood
no
my
parents
had
an
aversion
for
corporal
punishment
my
father
used
to
flog
me
cruelly
my
father
was
a
harsh
sickly
government
clerk
with
a
long
nose
and
a
yellow
neck
but
let
us
talk
of
you
no
one
has
laid
a
finger
on
you
all
your
life
no
one
has
scared
you
nor
beaten
you
you
are
as
strong
as
a
bull
you
grew
up
under
your
father
wing
and
studied
at
his
expense
and
then
you
dropped
at
once
into
a
sinecure
for
more
than
twenty
years
you
have
lived
rent
free
with
heating
lighting
and
service
all
provided
and
had
the
right
to
work
how
you
pleased
and
as
much
as
you
pleased
even
to
do
nothing
you
were
naturally
a
flabby
lazy
man
and
so
you
have
tried
to
arrange
your
life
so
that
nothing
should
disturb
you
or
make
you
move
you
have
handed
over
your
work
to
the
assistant
and
the
rest
of
the
rabble
while
you
sit
in
peace
and
warmth
save
money
read
amuse
yourself
with
reflections
with
all
sorts
of
lofty
nonsense
and
ivan
dmitritch
looked
at
the
doctor
red
nose
with
boozing
in
fact
you
have
seen
nothing
of
life
you
know
absolutely
nothing
of
it
and
are
only
theoretically
acquainted
with
reality
you
despise
suffering
and
are
surprised
at
nothing
for
a
very
simple
reason
vanity
of
vanities
the
external
and
the
internal
contempt
for
life
for
suffering
and
for
death
comprehension
true
happiness
that
the
philosophy
that
suits
the
russian
sluggard
best
you
see
a
peasant
beating
his
wife
for
instance
why
interfere
let
him
beat
her
they
will
both
die
sooner
or
later
anyway
and
besides
he
who
beats
injures
by
his
blows
not
the
person
he
is
beating
but
himself
to
get
drunk
is
stupid
and
unseemly
but
if
you
drink
you
die
and
if
you
do
drink
you
die
a
peasant
woman
comes
with
toothache
well
what
of
it
pain
is
the
idea
of
pain
and
besides
is
no
living
in
this
world
without
illness
we
shall
all
die
and
so
go
away
woman
do
hinder
me
from
thinking
and
drinking
vodka
a
young
man
asks
advice
what
he
is
to
do
how
he
is
to
live
anyone
else
would
think
before
answering
but
you
have
got
the
answer
ready
strive
for
or
for
true
happiness
and
what
is
that
fantastic
happiness
there
no
answer
of
course
we
are
kept
here
behind
barred
windows
tortured
left
to
rot
but
that
is
very
good
and
reasonable
because
there
is
no
difference
at
all
between
this
ward
and
a
warm
snug
study
a
convenient
philosophy
you
can
do
nothing
and
your
conscience
is
clear
and
you
feel
you
are
wise
no
sir
it
is
not
philosophy
it
not
thinking
it
not
breadth
of
vision
but
laziness
fakirism
drowsy
stupefaction
yes
cried
ivan
dmitritch
getting
angry
again
you
despise
suffering
but
i
be
bound
if
you
pinch
your
finger
in
the
door
you
will
howl
at
the
top
of
your
voice
and
perhaps
i
should
howl
said
andrey
yefimitch
with
a
gentle
smile
oh
i
dare
say
well
if
you
had
a
stroke
of
paralysis
or
supposing
some
fool
or
bully
took
advantage
of
his
position
and
rank
to
insult
you
in
public
and
if
you
knew
he
could
do
it
with
impunity
then
you
would
understand
what
it
means
to
put
people
off
with
comprehension
and
true
happiness
that
original
said
andrey
yefimitch
laughing
with
pleasure
and
rubbing
his
hands
i
am
agreeably
struck
by
your
inclination
for
drawing
generalizations
and
the
sketch
of
my
character
you
have
just
drawn
is
simply
brilliant
i
must
confess
that
talking
to
you
gives
me
great
pleasure
well
i
listened
to
you
and
now
you
must
graciously
listen
to
me
xi
the
conversation
went
on
for
about
an
hour
longer
and
apparently
made
a
deep
impression
on
andrey
yefimitch
he
began
going
to
the
ward
every
day
he
went
there
in
the
mornings
and
after
dinner
and
often
the
dusk
of
evening
found
him
in
conversation
with
ivan
dmitritch
at
first
ivan
dmitritch
held
aloof
from
him
suspected
him
of
evil
designs
and
openly
expressed
his
hostility
but
afterwards
he
got
used
to
him
and
his
abrupt
manner
changed
to
one
of
condescending
irony
soon
it
was
all
over
the
hospital
that
the
doctor
andrey
yefimitch
had
taken
to
visiting
ward
no
no
one
neither
sergey
sergevitch
nor
nikita
nor
the
nurses
could
conceive
why
he
went
there
why
he
stayed
there
for
hours
together
what
he
was
talking
about
and
why
he
did
not
write
prescriptions
his
actions
seemed
strange
often
mihail
averyanitch
did
not
find
him
at
home
which
had
never
happened
in
the
past
and
daryushka
was
greatly
perturbed
for
the
doctor
drank
his
beer
now
at
no
definite
time
and
sometimes
was
even
late
for
dinner
one
day
it
was
at
the
end
of
june
hobotov
went
to
see
andrey
yefimitch
about
something
not
finding
him
at
home
he
proceeded
to
look
for
him
in
the
yard
there
he
was
told
that
the
old
doctor
had
gone
to
see
the
mental
patients
going
into
the
lodge
and
stopping
in
the
entry
hobotov
heard
the
following
conversation
we
shall
never
agree
and
you
will
not
succeed
in
converting
me
to
your
faith
ivan
dmitritch
was
saying
irritably
you
are
utterly
ignorant
of
reality
and
you
have
never
known
suffering
but
have
only
like
a
leech
fed
beside
the
sufferings
of
others
while
i
have
been
in
continual
suffering
from
the
day
of
my
birth
till
for
that
reason
i
tell
you
frankly
i
consider
myself
superior
to
you
and
more
competent
in
every
respect
it
not
for
you
to
teach
me
i
have
absolutely
no
ambition
to
convert
you
to
my
faith
said
andrey
yefimitch
gently
and
with
regret
that
the
other
refused
to
understand
him
and
that
is
not
what
matters
my
friend
what
matters
is
not
that
you
have
suffered
and
i
have
not
joy
and
suffering
are
passing
let
us
leave
them
never
mind
them
what
matters
is
that
you
and
i
think
we
see
in
each
other
people
who
are
capable
of
thinking
and
reasoning
and
that
is
a
common
bond
between
us
however
different
our
views
if
you
knew
my
friend
how
sick
i
am
of
the
universal
senselessness
ineptitude
stupidity
and
with
what
delight
i
always
talk
with
you
you
are
an
intelligent
man
and
i
enjoyed
your
company
hobotov
opened
the
door
an
inch
and
glanced
into
the
ward
ivan
dmitritch
in
his
and
the
doctor
andrey
yefimitch
were
sitting
side
by
side
on
the
bed
the
madman
was
grimacing
twitching
and
convulsively
wrapping
himself
in
his
gown
while
the
doctor
sat
motionless
with
bowed
head
and
his
face
was
red
and
look
helpless
and
sorrowful
hobotov
shrugged
his
shoulders
grinned
and
glanced
at
nikita
nikita
shrugged
his
shoulders
too
next
day
hobotov
went
to
the
lodge
accompanied
by
the
assistant
both
stood
in
the
entry
and
listened
i
fancy
our
old
man
has
gone
clean
off
his
chump
said
hobotov
as
he
came
out
of
the
lodge
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
sinners
sighed
the
decorous
sergey
sergeyitch
scrupulously
avoiding
the
puddles
that
he
might
not
muddy
his
polished
boots
i
must
own
honoured
yevgeny
fyodoritch
i
have
been
expecting
it
for
a
long
time
xii
after
this
andrey
yefimitch
began
to
notice
a
mysterious
air
in
all
around
him
the
attendants
the
nurses
and
the
patients
looked
at
him
inquisitively
when
they
met
him
and
then
whispered
together
the
superintendent
little
daughter
masha
whom
he
liked
to
meet
in
the
hospital
garden
for
some
reason
ran
away
from
him
now
when
he
went
up
with
a
smile
to
stroke
her
on
the
head
the
postmaster
no
longer
said
perfectly
true
as
he
listened
to
him
but
in
unaccountable
confusion
muttered
yes
yes
yes
and
looked
at
him
with
a
grieved
and
thoughtful
expression
for
some
reason
he
took
to
advising
his
friend
to
give
up
vodka
and
beer
but
as
a
man
of
delicate
feeling
he
did
not
say
this
directly
but
hinted
it
telling
him
first
about
the
commanding
officer
of
his
battalion
an
excellent
man
and
then
about
the
priest
of
the
regiment
a
capital
fellow
both
of
whom
drank
and
fell
ill
but
on
giving
up
drinking
completely
regained
their
health
on
two
or
three
occasions
andrey
yefimitch
was
visited
by
his
colleague
hobotov
who
also
advised
him
to
give
up
spirituous
liquors
and
for
no
apparent
reason
recommended
him
to
take
bromide
in
august
andrey
yefimitch
got
a
letter
from
the
mayor
of
the
town
asking
him
to
come
on
very
important
business
on
arriving
at
the
town
hall
at
the
time
fixed
andrey
yefimitch
found
there
the
military
commander
the
superintendent
of
the
district
school
a
member
of
the
town
council
hobotov
and
a
plump
fair
gentleman
who
was
introduced
to
him
as
a
doctor
this
doctor
with
a
polish
surname
difficult
to
pronounce
lived
at
a
pedigree
twenty
miles
away
and
was
now
on
a
visit
to
the
town
there
something
that
concerns
you
said
the
member
of
the
town
council
addressing
andrey
yefimitch
after
they
had
all
greeted
one
another
and
sat
down
to
the
table
here
yevgeny
fyodoritch
says
that
there
is
not
room
for
the
dispensary
in
the
main
building
and
that
it
ought
to
be
transferred
to
one
of
the
lodges
that
of
no
consequence
of
course
it
can
be
transferred
but
the
point
is
that
the
lodge
wants
doing
up
yes
it
would
have
to
be
done
up
said
andrey
yefimitch
after
a
moment
thought
if
the
corner
lodge
for
instance
were
fitted
up
as
a
dispensary
i
imagine
it
would
cost
at
least
five
hundred
roubles
an
unproductive
expenditure
everyone
was
silent
for
a
space
i
had
the
honour
of
submitting
to
you
ten
years
ago
andrey
yefimitch
went
on
in
a
low
voice
that
the
hospital
in
its
present
form
is
a
luxury
for
the
town
beyond
its
means
it
was
built
in
the
forties
but
things
were
different
then
the
town
spends
too
much
on
unnecessary
buildings
and
superfluous
staff
i
believe
with
a
different
system
two
model
hospitals
might
be
maintained
for
the
same
money
well
let
us
have
a
different
system
then
the
member
of
the
town
council
said
briskly
i
have
already
had
the
honour
of
submitting
to
you
that
the
medical
department
should
be
transferred
to
the
supervision
of
the
zemstvo
yes
transfer
the
money
to
the
zemstvo
and
they
will
steal
it
laughed
the
doctor
that
what
it
always
comes
to
the
member
of
the
council
assented
and
he
also
laughed
andrey
yefimitch
looked
with
apathetic
lustreless
eyes
at
the
doctor
and
said
one
should
be
just
again
there
was
silence
tea
was
brought
in
the
military
commander
for
some
reason
much
embarrassed
touched
andrey
yefimitch
hand
across
the
table
and
said
you
have
quite
forgotten
us
doctor
but
of
course
you
are
a
hermit
you
do
play
cards
and
do
like
women
you
would
be
dull
with
fellows
like
us
they
all
began
saying
how
boring
it
was
for
a
decent
person
to
live
in
such
a
town
no
theatre
no
music
and
at
the
last
dance
at
the
club
there
had
been
about
twenty
ladies
and
only
two
gentlemen
the
young
men
did
not
dance
but
spent
all
the
time
crowding
round
the
refreshment
bar
or
playing
cards
not
looking
at
anyone
and
speaking
slowly
in
a
low
voice
andrey
yefimitch
began
saying
what
a
pity
what
a
terrible
pity
it
was
that
the
townspeople
should
waste
their
vital
energy
their
hearts
and
their
minds
on
cards
and
gossip
and
should
have
neither
the
power
nor
the
inclination
to
spend
their
time
in
interesting
conversation
and
reading
and
should
refuse
to
take
advantage
of
the
enjoyments
of
the
mind
the
mind
alone
was
interesting
and
worthy
of
attention
all
the
rest
was
low
and
petty
hobotov
listened
to
his
colleague
attentively
and
suddenly
asked
andrey
yefimitch
what
day
of
the
month
is
it
having
received
an
answer
the
doctor
and
he
in
the
tone
of
examiners
conscious
of
their
lack
of
skill
began
asking
andrey
yefimitch
what
was
the
day
of
the
week
how
many
days
there
were
in
the
year
and
whether
it
was
true
that
there
was
a
remarkable
prophet
living
in
ward
no
in
response
to
the
last
question
andrey
yefimitch
turned
rather
red
and
said
yes
he
is
mentally
deranged
but
he
is
an
interesting
young
man
they
asked
him
no
other
questions
when
he
was
putting
on
his
overcoat
in
the
entry
the
military
commander
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
said
with
a
sigh
it
time
for
us
old
fellows
to
rest
as
he
came
out
of
the
hall
andrey
yefimitch
understood
that
it
had
been
a
committee
appointed
to
enquire
into
his
mental
condition
he
recalled
the
questions
that
had
been
asked
him
flushed
crimson
and
for
some
reason
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
felt
bitterly
grieved
for
medical
science
my
god
he
thought
remembering
how
these
doctors
had
just
examined
him
why
they
have
only
lately
been
hearing
lectures
on
mental
pathology
they
had
passed
an
examination
what
the
explanation
of
this
crass
ignorance
they
have
not
a
conception
of
mental
pathology
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
felt
insulted
and
moved
to
anger
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
mihail
averyanitch
came
to
see
him
the
postmaster
went
up
to
him
without
waiting
to
greet
him
took
him
by
both
hands
and
said
in
an
agitated
voice
my
dear
fellow
my
dear
friend
show
me
that
you
believe
in
my
genuine
affection
and
look
on
me
as
your
friend
and
preventing
andrey
yefimitch
from
speaking
he
went
on
growing
excited
i
love
you
for
your
culture
and
nobility
of
soul
listen
to
me
my
dear
fellow
the
rules
of
their
profession
compel
the
doctors
to
conceal
the
truth
from
you
but
i
blurt
out
the
plain
truth
like
a
soldier
you
are
not
well
excuse
me
my
dear
fellow
but
it
is
the
truth
everyone
about
you
has
been
noticing
it
for
a
long
time
yevgeny
fyodoritch
has
just
told
me
that
it
is
essential
for
you
to
rest
and
distract
your
mind
for
the
sake
of
your
health
perfectly
true
excellent
in
a
day
or
two
i
am
taking
a
holiday
and
am
going
away
for
a
sniff
of
a
different
atmosphere
show
that
you
are
a
friend
to
me
let
us
go
together
let
us
go
for
a
jaunt
as
in
the
good
old
days
i
feel
perfectly
well
said
andrey
yefimitch
after
a
thought
i
ca
go
away
allow
me
to
show
you
my
friendship
in
some
other
way
to
go
off
with
no
object
without
his
books
without
his
daryushka
without
his
beer
to
break
abruptly
through
the
routine
of
life
established
for
twenty
years
the
idea
for
the
first
minute
struck
him
as
wild
and
fantastic
but
he
remembered
the
conversation
at
the
zemstvo
committee
and
the
depressing
feelings
with
which
he
had
returned
home
and
the
thought
of
a
brief
absence
from
the
town
in
which
stupid
people
looked
on
him
as
a
madman
was
pleasant
to
him
and
where
precisely
do
you
intend
to
go
he
asked
to
moscow
to
petersburg
to
warsaw
i
spent
the
five
happiest
years
of
my
life
in
warsaw
what
a
marvellous
town
let
us
go
my
dear
fellow
xiii
a
week
later
it
was
suggested
to
andrey
yefimitch
that
he
should
have
a
rest
that
is
send
in
his
resignation
a
suggestion
he
received
with
indifference
and
a
week
later
still
mihail
averyanitch
and
he
were
sitting
in
a
posting
carriage
driving
to
the
nearest
railway
station
the
days
were
cool
and
bright
with
a
blue
sky
and
a
transparent
distance
they
were
two
days
driving
the
hundred
and
fifty
miles
to
the
railway
station
and
stayed
two
nights
on
the
way
when
at
the
posting
station
the
glasses
given
them
for
their
tea
had
not
been
properly
washed
or
the
drivers
were
slow
in
harnessing
the
horses
mihail
averyanitch
would
turn
crimson
and
quivering
all
over
would
shout
hold
your
tongue
do
argue
and
in
the
carriage
he
talked
without
ceasing
for
a
moment
describing
his
campaigns
in
the
caucasus
and
in
poland
what
adventures
he
had
had
what
meetings
he
talked
loudly
and
opened
his
eyes
so
wide
with
wonder
that
he
might
well
be
thought
to
be
lying
moreover
as
he
talked
he
breathed
in
andrey
yefimitch
face
and
laughed
into
his
ear
this
bothered
the
doctor
and
prevented
him
from
thinking
or
concentrating
his
mind
in
the
train
they
travelled
from
motives
of
economy
in
a
compartment
half
the
passengers
were
decent
people
mihail
averyanitch
soon
made
friends
with
everyone
and
moving
from
one
seat
to
another
kept
saying
loudly
that
they
ought
not
to
travel
by
these
appalling
lines
it
was
a
regular
swindle
a
very
different
thing
riding
on
a
good
horse
one
could
do
over
seventy
miles
a
day
and
feel
fresh
and
well
after
it
and
our
bad
harvests
were
due
to
the
draining
of
the
pinsk
marshes
altogether
the
way
things
were
done
was
dreadful
he
got
excited
talked
loudly
and
would
not
let
others
speak
this
endless
chatter
to
the
accompaniment
of
loud
laughter
and
expressive
gestures
wearied
andrey
yefimitch
which
of
us
is
the
madman
he
thought
with
vexation
i
who
try
not
to
disturb
my
in
any
way
or
this
egoist
who
thinks
that
he
is
cleverer
and
more
interesting
than
anyone
here
and
so
will
leave
no
one
in
peace
in
moscow
mihail
averyanitch
put
on
a
military
coat
without
epaulettes
and
trousers
with
red
braid
on
them
he
wore
a
military
cap
and
overcoat
in
the
street
and
soldiers
saluted
him
it
seemed
to
andrey
yefimitch
now
that
his
companion
was
a
man
who
had
flung
away
all
that
was
good
and
kept
only
what
was
bad
of
all
the
characteristics
of
a
country
gentleman
that
he
had
once
possessed
he
liked
to
be
waited
on
even
when
it
was
quite
unnecessary
the
matches
would
be
lying
before
him
on
the
table
and
he
would
see
them
and
shout
to
the
waiter
to
give
him
the
matches
he
did
not
hesitate
to
appear
before
a
maidservant
in
nothing
but
his
underclothes
he
used
the
familiar
mode
of
address
to
all
footmen
indiscriminately
even
old
men
and
when
he
was
angry
called
them
fools
and
blockheads
this
andrey
yefimitch
thought
was
like
a
gentleman
but
disgusting
first
of
all
mihail
averyanitch
led
his
friend
to
the
iversky
madonna
he
prayed
fervently
shedding
tears
and
bowing
down
to
the
earth
and
when
he
had
finished
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
said
even
though
one
does
not
believe
it
makes
one
somehow
easier
when
one
prays
a
little
kiss
the
ikon
my
dear
fellow
andrey
yefimitch
was
embarrassed
and
he
kissed
the
image
while
mihail
averyanitch
pursed
up
his
lips
and
prayed
in
a
whisper
and
again
tears
came
into
his
eyes
then
they
went
to
the
kremlin
and
looked
there
at
the
and
the
and
even
touched
them
with
their
fingers
admired
the
view
over
the
river
visited
saviour
and
the
rumyantsev
museum
they
dined
at
tyestov
mihail
averyanitch
looked
a
long
time
at
the
menu
stroking
his
whiskers
and
said
in
the
tone
of
a
gourmand
accustomed
to
dine
in
restaurants
we
shall
see
what
you
give
us
to
eat
angel
xiv
the
doctor
walked
about
looked
at
things
ate
and
drank
but
he
had
all
the
while
one
feeling
annoyance
with
mihail
averyanitch
he
longed
to
have
a
rest
from
his
friend
to
get
away
from
him
to
hide
himself
while
the
friend
thought
it
was
his
duty
not
to
let
the
doctor
move
a
step
away
from
him
and
to
provide
him
with
as
many
distractions
as
possible
when
there
was
nothing
to
look
at
he
entertained
him
with
conversation
for
two
days
andrey
yefimitch
endured
it
but
on
the
third
he
announced
to
his
friend
that
he
was
ill
and
wanted
to
stay
at
home
for
the
whole
day
his
friend
replied
that
in
that
case
he
would
stay
too
that
really
he
needed
rest
for
he
was
run
off
his
legs
already
andrey
yefimitch
lay
on
the
sofa
with
his
face
to
the
back
and
clenching
his
teeth
listened
to
his
friend
who
assured
him
with
heat
that
sooner
or
later
france
would
certainly
thrash
germany
that
there
were
a
great
many
scoundrels
in
moscow
and
that
it
was
impossible
to
judge
of
a
horse
quality
by
its
outward
appearance
the
doctor
began
to
have
a
buzzing
in
his
ears
and
palpitations
of
the
heart
but
out
of
delicacy
could
not
bring
himself
to
beg
his
friend
to
go
away
or
hold
his
tongue
fortunately
mihail
averyanitch
grew
weary
of
sitting
in
the
hotel
room
and
after
dinner
he
went
out
for
a
walk
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
andrey
yefimitch
abandoned
himself
to
a
feeling
of
relief
how
pleasant
to
lie
motionless
on
the
sofa
and
to
know
that
one
is
alone
in
the
room
real
happiness
is
impossible
without
solitude
the
fallen
angel
betrayed
god
probably
because
he
longed
for
solitude
of
which
the
angels
know
nothing
andrey
yefimitch
wanted
to
think
about
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
during
the
last
few
days
but
he
could
not
get
mihail
averyanitch
out
of
his
head
why
he
has
taken
a
holiday
and
come
with
me
out
of
friendship
out
of
generosity
thought
the
doctor
with
vexation
nothing
could
be
worse
than
this
friendly
supervision
i
suppose
he
is
and
generous
and
a
lively
fellow
but
he
is
a
bore
an
insufferable
bore
in
the
same
way
there
are
people
who
never
say
anything
but
what
is
clever
and
good
yet
one
feels
that
they
are
people
for
the
following
days
andrey
yefimitch
declared
himself
ill
and
would
not
leave
the
hotel
room
he
lay
with
his
face
to
the
back
of
the
sofa
and
suffered
agonies
of
weariness
when
his
friend
entertained
him
with
conversation
or
rested
when
his
friend
was
absent
he
was
vexed
with
himself
for
having
come
and
with
his
friend
who
grew
every
day
more
talkative
and
more
he
could
not
succeed
in
attuning
his
thoughts
to
a
serious
and
lofty
level
this
is
what
i
get
from
the
real
life
ivan
dmitritch
talked
about
he
thought
angry
at
his
own
pettiness
it
of
no
consequence
though
i
shall
go
home
and
everything
will
go
on
as
before
it
was
the
same
thing
in
petersburg
too
for
whole
days
together
he
did
not
leave
the
hotel
room
but
lay
on
the
sofa
and
only
got
up
to
drink
beer
mihail
averyanitch
was
all
haste
to
get
to
warsaw
my
dear
man
what
should
i
go
there
for
said
andrey
yefimitch
in
an
imploring
voice
you
go
alone
and
let
me
get
home
i
entreat
you
on
no
account
protested
mihail
averyanitch
it
a
marvellous
town
andrey
yefimitch
had
not
the
strength
of
will
to
insist
on
his
own
way
and
much
against
his
inclination
went
to
warsaw
there
he
did
not
leave
the
hotel
room
but
lay
on
the
sofa
furious
with
himself
with
his
friend
and
with
the
waiters
who
obstinately
refused
to
understand
russian
while
mihail
averyanitch
healthy
hearty
and
full
of
spirits
as
usual
went
about
the
town
from
morning
to
night
looking
for
his
old
acquaintances
several
times
he
did
not
return
home
at
night
after
one
night
spent
in
some
unknown
haunt
he
returned
home
early
in
the
morning
in
a
violently
excited
condition
with
a
red
face
and
tousled
hair
for
a
long
time
he
walked
up
and
down
the
rooms
muttering
something
to
himself
then
stopped
and
said
honour
before
everything
after
walking
up
and
down
a
little
longer
he
clutched
his
head
in
both
hands
and
pronounced
in
a
tragic
voice
yes
honour
before
everything
accursed
be
the
moment
when
the
idea
first
entered
my
head
to
visit
this
babylon
my
dear
friend
he
added
addressing
the
doctor
you
may
despise
me
i
have
played
and
lost
lend
me
five
hundred
roubles
andrey
yefimitch
counted
out
five
hundred
roubles
and
gave
them
to
his
friend
without
a
word
the
latter
still
crimson
with
shame
and
anger
incoherently
articulated
some
useless
vow
put
on
his
cap
and
went
out
returning
two
hours
later
he
flopped
into
an
heaved
a
loud
sigh
and
said
my
honour
is
saved
let
us
go
my
friend
i
do
not
care
to
remain
another
hour
in
this
accursed
town
scoundrels
austrian
spies
by
the
time
the
friends
were
back
in
their
own
town
it
was
november
and
deep
snow
was
lying
in
the
streets
hobotov
had
andrey
yefimitch
post
he
was
still
living
in
his
old
lodgings
waiting
for
andrey
yefimitch
to
arrive
and
clear
out
of
the
hospital
apartments
the
plain
woman
whom
he
called
his
cook
was
already
established
in
one
of
the
lodges
fresh
scandals
about
the
hospital
were
going
the
round
of
the
town
it
was
said
that
the
plain
woman
had
quarrelled
with
the
superintendent
and
that
the
latter
had
crawled
on
his
knees
before
her
begging
forgiveness
on
the
very
first
day
he
arrived
andrey
yefimitch
had
to
look
out
for
lodgings
my
friend
the
postmaster
said
to
him
timidly
excuse
an
indiscreet
question
what
means
have
you
at
your
disposal
andrey
yefimitch
without
a
word
counted
out
his
money
and
said
roubles
i
do
mean
that
mihail
averyanitch
brought
out
in
confusion
misunderstanding
him
i
mean
what
have
you
to
live
on
i
tell
you
roubles
i
have
nothing
else
mihail
averyanitch
looked
upon
the
doctor
as
an
honourable
man
yet
he
suspected
that
he
had
accumulated
a
fortune
of
at
least
twenty
thousand
now
learning
that
andrey
yefimitch
was
a
beggar
that
he
had
nothing
to
live
on
he
was
for
some
reason
suddenly
moved
to
tears
and
embraced
his
friend
xv
andrey
yefimitch
now
lodged
in
a
little
house
with
three
windows
there
were
only
three
rooms
besides
the
kitchen
in
the
little
house
the
doctor
lived
in
two
of
them
which
looked
into
the
street
while
daryushka
and
the
landlady
with
her
three
children
lived
in
the
third
room
and
the
kitchen
sometimes
the
landlady
lover
a
drunken
peasant
who
was
rowdy
and
reduced
the
children
and
daryushka
to
terror
would
come
for
the
night
when
he
arrived
and
established
himself
in
the
kitchen
and
demanded
vodka
they
all
felt
very
uncomfortable
and
the
doctor
would
be
moved
by
pity
to
take
the
crying
children
into
his
room
and
let
them
lie
on
his
floor
and
this
gave
him
great
satisfaction
he
got
up
as
before
at
eight
and
after
his
morning
tea
sat
down
to
read
his
old
books
and
magazines
he
had
no
money
for
new
ones
either
because
the
books
were
old
or
perhaps
because
of
the
change
in
his
surroundings
reading
exhausted
him
and
did
not
grip
his
attention
as
before
that
he
might
not
spend
his
time
in
idleness
he
made
a
detailed
catalogue
of
his
books
and
gummed
little
labels
on
their
backs
and
this
mechanical
tedious
work
seemed
to
him
more
interesting
than
reading
the
monotonous
tedious
work
lulled
his
thoughts
to
sleep
in
some
unaccountable
way
and
the
time
passed
quickly
while
he
thought
of
nothing
even
sitting
in
the
kitchen
peeling
potatoes
with
daryushka
or
picking
over
the
buckwheat
grain
seemed
to
him
interesting
on
saturdays
and
sundays
he
went
to
church
standing
near
the
wall
and
half
closing
his
eyes
he
listened
to
the
singing
and
thought
of
his
father
of
his
mother
of
the
university
of
the
religions
of
the
world
he
felt
calm
and
melancholy
and
as
he
went
out
of
the
church
afterwards
he
regretted
that
the
service
was
so
soon
over
he
went
twice
to
the
hospital
to
talk
to
ivan
dmitritch
but
on
both
occasions
ivan
dmitritch
was
unusually
excited
and
he
bade
the
doctor
leave
him
in
peace
as
he
had
long
been
sick
of
empty
chatter
and
declared
to
make
up
for
all
his
sufferings
he
asked
from
the
damned
scoundrels
only
one
favour
solitary
confinement
surely
they
would
not
refuse
him
even
that
on
both
occasions
when
andrey
yefimitch
was
taking
leave
of
him
and
wishing
him
he
answered
rudely
and
said
go
to
hell
and
andrey
yefimitch
did
not
know
now
whether
to
go
to
him
for
the
third
time
or
not
he
longed
to
go
in
old
days
andrey
yefimitch
used
to
walk
about
his
rooms
and
think
in
the
interval
after
dinner
but
now
from
till
evening
tea
he
lay
on
the
sofa
with
his
face
to
the
back
and
gave
himself
up
to
trivial
thoughts
which
he
could
not
struggle
against
he
was
mortified
that
after
more
than
twenty
years
of
service
he
had
been
given
neither
a
pension
nor
any
assistance
it
is
true
that
he
had
not
done
his
work
honestly
but
then
all
who
are
in
the
service
get
a
pension
without
distinction
whether
they
are
honest
or
not
contemporary
justice
lies
precisely
in
the
bestowal
of
grades
orders
and
pensions
not
for
moral
qualities
or
capacities
but
for
service
whatever
it
may
have
been
like
why
was
he
alone
to
be
an
exception
he
had
no
money
at
all
he
was
ashamed
to
pass
by
the
shop
and
look
at
the
woman
who
owned
it
he
owed
roubles
for
beer
already
there
was
money
owing
to
the
landlady
also
daryushka
sold
old
clothes
and
books
on
the
sly
and
told
lies
to
the
landlady
saying
that
the
doctor
was
just
going
to
receive
a
large
sum
of
money
he
was
angry
with
himself
for
having
wasted
on
travelling
the
thousand
roubles
he
had
saved
up
how
useful
that
thousand
roubles
would
have
been
now
he
was
vexed
that
people
would
not
leave
him
in
peace
hobotov
thought
it
his
duty
to
look
in
on
his
sick
colleague
from
time
to
time
everything
about
him
was
revolting
to
andrey
yefimitch
his
face
and
vulgar
condescending
tone
and
his
use
of
the
word
colleague
and
his
high
the
most
revolting
thing
was
that
he
thought
it
was
his
duty
to
treat
andrey
yefimitch
and
thought
that
he
really
was
treating
him
on
every
visit
he
brought
a
bottle
of
bromide
and
rhubarb
pills
mihail
averyanitch
too
thought
it
his
duty
to
visit
his
friend
and
entertain
him
every
time
he
went
in
to
andrey
yefimitch
with
an
affectation
of
ease
laughed
constrainedly
and
began
assuring
him
that
he
was
looking
very
well
and
that
thank
god
he
was
on
the
highroad
to
recovery
and
from
this
it
might
be
concluded
that
he
looked
on
his
friend
condition
as
hopeless
he
had
not
yet
repaid
his
warsaw
debt
and
was
overwhelmed
by
shame
he
was
constrained
and
so
tried
to
laugh
louder
and
talk
more
amusingly
his
anecdotes
and
descriptions
seemed
endless
now
and
were
an
agony
both
to
andrey
yefimitch
and
himself
in
his
presence
andrey
yefimitch
usually
lay
on
the
sofa
with
his
face
to
the
wall
and
listened
with
his
teeth
clenched
his
soul
was
oppressed
with
rankling
disgust
and
after
every
visit
from
his
friend
he
felt
as
though
this
disgust
had
risen
higher
and
was
mounting
into
his
throat
to
stifle
petty
thoughts
he
made
haste
to
reflect
that
he
himself
and
hobotov
and
mihail
averyanitch
would
all
sooner
or
later
perish
without
leaving
any
trace
on
the
world
if
one
imagined
some
spirit
flying
by
the
earthly
globe
in
space
in
a
million
years
he
would
see
nothing
but
clay
and
bare
rocks
everything
culture
and
the
moral
law
would
pass
away
and
not
even
a
burdock
would
grow
out
of
them
of
what
consequence
was
shame
in
the
presence
of
a
shopkeeper
of
what
consequence
was
the
insignificant
hobotov
or
the
wearisome
friendship
of
mihail
averyanitch
it
was
all
trivial
and
nonsensical
but
such
reflections
did
not
help
him
now
scarcely
had
he
imagined
the
earthly
globe
in
a
million
years
when
hobotov
in
his
high
or
mihail
averyanitch
with
his
forced
laugh
would
appear
from
behind
a
bare
rock
and
he
even
heard
the
shamefaced
whisper
the
warsaw
debt
i
will
repay
it
in
a
day
or
two
my
dear
fellow
without
fail
xvi
one
day
mihail
averyanitch
came
after
dinner
when
andrey
yefimitch
was
lying
on
the
sofa
it
so
happened
that
hobotov
arrived
at
the
same
time
with
his
bromide
andrey
yefimitch
got
up
heavily
and
sat
down
leaning
both
arms
on
the
sofa
you
have
a
much
better
colour
than
you
had
yesterday
my
dear
man
began
mihail
averyanitch
yes
you
look
jolly
upon
my
soul
you
do
it
high
time
you
were
well
dear
colleague
said
hobotov
yawning
i
be
bound
you
are
sick
of
this
bobbery
and
we
shall
recover
said
mihail
averyanitch
cheerfully
we
shall
live
another
hundred
years
to
be
sure
not
a
hundred
years
but
another
twenty
hobotov
said
reassuringly
it
all
right
all
right
colleague
do
lose
heart
go
piling
it
on
we
show
what
we
can
do
laughed
mihail
averyanitch
and
he
slapped
his
friend
on
the
knee
we
show
them
yet
next
summer
please
god
we
shall
be
off
to
the
caucasus
and
we
will
ride
all
over
it
on
horseback
trot
trot
trot
and
when
we
are
back
from
the
caucasus
i
should
wonder
if
we
will
all
dance
at
the
wedding
mihail
averyanitch
gave
a
sly
wink
we
marry
you
my
dear
boy
we
marry
you
andrey
yefimitch
felt
suddenly
that
the
rising
disgust
had
mounted
to
his
throat
his
heart
began
beating
violently
that
vulgar
he
said
getting
up
quickly
and
walking
away
to
the
window
do
you
understand
that
you
are
talking
vulgar
nonsense
he
meant
to
go
on
softly
and
politely
but
against
his
will
he
suddenly
clenched
his
fists
and
raised
them
above
his
head
leave
me
alone
he
shouted
in
a
voice
unlike
his
own
blushing
crimson
and
shaking
all
over
go
away
both
of
you
mihail
averyanitch
and
hobotov
got
up
and
stared
at
him
first
with
amazement
and
then
with
alarm
go
away
both
andrey
yefimitch
went
on
shouting
stupid
people
foolish
people
i
do
want
either
your
friendship
or
your
medicines
stupid
man
vulgar
nasty
hobotov
and
mihail
averyanitch
looking
at
each
other
in
bewilderment
staggered
to
the
door
and
went
out
andrey
yefimitch
snatched
up
the
bottle
of
bromide
and
flung
it
after
them
the
bottle
broke
with
a
crash
on
the
go
to
the
devil
he
shouted
in
a
tearful
voice
running
out
into
the
passage
to
the
devil
when
his
guests
were
gone
andrey
yefimitch
lay
down
on
the
sofa
trembling
as
though
in
a
fever
and
went
on
for
a
long
while
repeating
stupid
people
foolish
people
when
he
was
calmer
what
occurred
to
him
first
of
all
was
the
thought
that
poor
mihail
averyanitch
must
be
feeling
fearfully
ashamed
and
depressed
now
and
that
it
was
all
dreadful
nothing
like
this
had
ever
happened
to
him
before
where
was
his
intelligence
and
his
tact
where
was
his
comprehension
of
things
and
his
philosophical
indifference
the
doctor
could
not
sleep
all
night
for
shame
and
vexation
with
himself
and
at
ten
next
morning
he
went
to
the
post
office
and
apologized
to
the
postmaster
we
wo
think
again
of
what
has
happened
mihail
averyanitch
greatly
touched
said
with
a
sigh
warmly
pressing
his
hand
let
bygones
be
bygones
lyubavkin
he
suddenly
shouted
so
loud
that
all
the
postmen
and
other
persons
present
started
hand
a
chair
and
you
wait
he
shouted
to
a
peasant
woman
who
was
stretching
out
a
registered
letter
to
him
through
the
grating
do
you
see
that
i
am
busy
we
will
not
remember
the
past
he
went
on
affectionately
addressing
andrey
yefimitch
sit
down
i
beg
you
my
dear
fellow
for
a
minute
he
stroked
his
knees
in
silence
and
then
said
i
have
never
had
a
thought
of
taking
offence
illness
is
no
joke
i
understand
your
attack
frightened
the
doctor
and
me
yesterday
and
we
had
a
long
talk
about
you
afterwards
my
dear
friend
why
wo
you
treat
your
illness
seriously
you
ca
go
on
like
this
excuse
me
speaking
openly
as
a
friend
whispered
mihail
averyanitch
you
live
in
the
most
unfavourable
surroundings
in
a
crowd
in
uncleanliness
no
one
to
look
after
you
no
money
for
proper
treatment
my
dear
friend
the
doctor
and
i
implore
you
with
all
our
hearts
listen
to
our
advice
go
into
the
hospital
there
you
will
have
wholesome
food
and
attendance
and
treatment
though
between
ourselves
yevgeny
fyodoritch
is
yet
he
does
understand
his
work
you
can
fully
rely
upon
him
he
has
promised
me
he
will
look
after
you
andrey
yefimitch
was
touched
by
the
postmaster
genuine
sympathy
and
the
tears
which
suddenly
glittered
on
his
cheeks
my
honoured
friend
do
believe
it
he
whispered
laying
his
hand
on
his
heart
do
believe
them
it
all
a
sham
my
illness
is
only
that
in
twenty
years
i
have
only
found
one
intelligent
man
in
the
whole
town
and
he
is
mad
i
am
not
ill
at
all
it
simply
that
i
have
got
into
an
enchanted
circle
which
there
is
no
getting
out
of
i
do
care
i
am
ready
for
anything
go
into
the
hospital
my
dear
fellow
i
do
care
if
it
were
into
the
pit
give
me
your
word
my
dear
man
that
you
will
obey
yevgeny
fyodoritch
in
everything
certainly
i
will
give
you
my
word
but
i
repeat
my
honoured
friend
i
have
got
into
an
enchanted
circle
now
everything
even
the
genuine
sympathy
of
my
friends
leads
to
the
same
thing
to
my
ruin
i
am
going
to
my
ruin
and
i
have
the
manliness
to
recognize
it
my
dear
fellow
you
will
recover
what
the
use
of
saying
that
said
andrey
yefimitch
with
irritation
there
are
few
men
who
at
the
end
of
their
lives
do
not
experience
what
i
am
experiencing
now
when
you
are
told
that
you
have
something
such
as
diseased
kidneys
or
enlarged
heart
and
you
begin
being
treated
for
it
or
are
told
you
are
mad
or
a
criminal
that
is
in
fact
when
people
suddenly
turn
their
attention
to
you
you
may
be
sure
you
have
got
into
an
enchanted
circle
from
which
you
will
not
escape
you
will
try
to
escape
and
make
things
worse
you
had
better
give
in
for
no
human
efforts
can
save
you
so
it
seems
to
me
meanwhile
the
public
was
crowding
at
the
grating
that
he
might
not
be
in
their
way
andrey
yefimitch
got
up
and
began
to
take
leave
mihail
averyanitch
made
him
promise
on
his
honour
once
more
and
escorted
him
to
the
outer
door
towards
evening
on
the
same
day
hobotov
in
his
sheepskin
and
his
high
suddenly
made
his
appearance
and
said
to
andrey
yefimitch
in
a
tone
as
though
nothing
had
happened
the
day
before
i
have
come
on
business
colleague
i
have
come
to
ask
you
whether
you
would
not
join
me
in
a
consultation
eh
thinking
that
hobotov
wanted
to
distract
his
mind
with
an
outing
or
perhaps
really
to
enable
him
to
earn
something
andrey
yefimitch
put
on
his
coat
and
hat
and
went
out
with
him
into
the
street
he
was
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
smooth
over
his
fault
of
the
previous
day
and
to
be
reconciled
and
in
his
heart
thanked
hobotov
who
did
not
even
allude
to
yesterday
scene
and
was
evidently
sparing
him
one
would
never
have
expected
such
delicacy
from
this
uncultured
man
where
is
your
invalid
asked
andrey
yefimitch
in
the
hospital
i
have
long
wanted
to
show
him
to
you
a
very
interesting
case
they
went
into
the
hospital
yard
and
going
round
the
main
building
turned
towards
the
lodge
where
the
mental
cases
were
kept
and
all
this
for
some
reason
in
silence
when
they
went
into
the
lodge
nikita
as
usual
jumped
up
and
stood
at
attention
one
of
the
patients
here
has
a
lung
complication
hobotov
said
in
an
undertone
going
into
the
yard
with
andrey
yefimitch
you
wait
here
i
be
back
directly
i
am
going
for
a
stethoscope
and
he
went
away
xvii
it
was
getting
dusk
ivan
dmitritch
was
lying
on
his
bed
with
his
face
thrust
unto
his
pillow
the
paralytic
was
sitting
motionless
crying
quietly
and
moving
his
lips
the
fat
peasant
and
the
former
sorter
were
asleep
it
was
quiet
andrey
yefimitch
sat
down
on
ivan
dmitritch
bed
and
waited
but
half
an
hour
passed
and
instead
of
hobotov
nikita
came
into
the
ward
with
a
some
underlinen
and
a
pair
of
slippers
in
a
heap
on
his
arm
please
change
your
things
your
honour
he
said
softly
here
is
your
bed
come
this
way
he
added
pointing
to
an
empty
bedstead
which
had
obviously
recently
been
brought
into
the
ward
it
all
right
please
god
you
will
recover
andrey
yefimitch
understood
it
all
without
saying
a
word
he
crossed
to
the
bed
to
which
nikita
pointed
and
sat
down
seeing
that
nikita
was
standing
waiting
he
undressed
entirely
and
he
felt
ashamed
then
he
put
on
the
hospital
clothes
the
drawers
were
very
short
the
shirt
was
long
and
the
smelt
of
smoked
fish
please
god
you
will
recover
repeated
nikita
and
he
gathered
up
andrey
yefimitch
clothes
into
his
arms
went
out
and
shut
the
door
after
him
no
matter
thought
andrey
yefimitch
wrapping
himself
in
his
in
a
shamefaced
way
and
feeling
that
he
looked
like
a
convict
in
his
new
costume
it
no
matter
it
does
not
matter
whether
it
a
or
a
uniform
or
this
but
how
about
his
watch
and
the
notebook
that
was
in
the
and
his
cigarettes
where
had
nikita
taken
his
clothes
now
perhaps
to
the
day
of
his
death
he
would
not
put
on
trousers
a
waistcoat
and
high
boots
it
was
all
somehow
strange
and
even
incomprehensible
at
first
andrey
yefimitch
was
even
now
convinced
that
there
was
no
difference
between
his
landlady
house
and
ward
no
that
everything
in
this
world
was
nonsense
and
vanity
of
vanities
and
yet
his
hands
were
trembling
his
feet
were
cold
and
he
was
filled
with
dread
at
the
thought
that
soon
ivan
dmitritch
would
get
up
and
see
that
he
was
in
a
he
got
up
and
walked
across
the
room
and
sat
down
again
here
he
had
been
sitting
already
half
an
hour
an
hour
and
he
was
miserably
sick
of
it
was
it
really
possible
to
live
here
a
day
a
week
and
even
years
like
these
people
why
he
had
been
sitting
here
had
walked
about
and
sat
down
again
he
could
get
up
and
look
out
of
window
and
walk
from
corner
to
corner
again
and
then
what
sit
so
all
the
time
like
a
post
and
think
no
that
was
scarcely
possible
andrey
yefimitch
lay
down
but
at
once
got
up
wiped
the
cold
sweat
from
his
brow
with
his
sleeve
and
felt
that
his
whole
face
smelt
of
smoked
fish
he
walked
about
again
it
some
misunderstanding
he
said
turning
out
the
palms
of
his
hands
in
perplexity
it
must
be
cleared
up
there
is
a
misunderstanding
meanwhile
ivan
dmitritch
woke
up
he
sat
up
and
propped
his
cheeks
on
his
fists
he
spat
then
he
glanced
lazily
at
the
doctor
and
apparently
for
the
first
minute
did
not
understand
but
soon
his
sleepy
face
grew
malicious
and
mocking
aha
so
they
have
put
you
in
here
too
old
fellow
he
said
in
a
voice
husky
from
sleepiness
screwing
up
one
eye
very
glad
to
see
you
you
sucked
the
blood
of
others
and
now
they
will
suck
yours
excellent
it
a
misunderstanding
andrey
yefimitch
brought
out
frightened
by
ivan
dmitritch
words
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
repeated
it
some
misunderstanding
ivan
dmitritch
spat
again
and
lay
down
cursed
life
he
grumbled
and
what
bitter
and
insulting
this
life
will
not
end
in
compensation
for
our
sufferings
it
will
not
end
with
apotheosis
as
it
would
in
an
opera
but
with
death
peasants
will
come
and
drag
one
dead
body
by
the
arms
and
the
legs
to
the
cellar
ugh
well
it
does
not
matter
we
shall
have
our
good
time
in
the
other
world
i
shall
come
here
as
a
ghost
from
the
other
world
and
frighten
these
reptiles
i
turn
their
hair
grey
moiseika
returned
and
seeing
the
doctor
held
out
his
hand
give
me
one
little
kopeck
he
said
xviii
andrey
yefimitch
walked
away
to
the
window
and
looked
out
into
the
open
country
it
was
getting
dark
and
on
the
horizon
to
the
right
a
cold
crimson
moon
was
mounting
upwards
not
far
from
the
hospital
fence
not
much
more
than
two
hundred
yards
away
stood
a
tall
white
house
shut
in
by
a
stone
wall
this
was
the
prison
so
this
is
real
life
thought
andrey
yefimitch
and
he
felt
frightened
the
moon
and
the
prison
and
the
nails
on
the
fence
and
the
flames
at
the
factory
were
all
terrible
behind
him
there
was
the
sound
of
a
sigh
andrey
yefimitch
looked
round
and
saw
a
man
with
glittering
stars
and
orders
on
his
breast
who
was
smiling
and
slyly
winking
and
this
too
seemed
terrible
andrey
yefimitch
assured
himself
that
there
was
nothing
special
about
the
moon
or
the
prison
that
even
sane
persons
wear
orders
and
that
everything
in
time
will
decay
and
turn
to
earth
but
he
was
suddenly
overcome
with
desire
he
clutched
at
the
grating
with
both
hands
and
shook
it
with
all
his
might
the
strong
grating
did
not
yield
then
that
it
might
not
be
so
dreadful
he
went
to
ivan
bed
and
sat
down
i
have
lost
heart
my
dear
fellow
he
muttered
trembling
and
wiping
away
the
cold
sweat
i
have
lost
heart
you
should
be
philosophical
said
ivan
dmitritch
ironically
my
god
my
god
yes
yes
you
were
pleased
to
say
once
that
there
was
no
philosophy
in
russia
but
that
all
people
even
the
paltriest
talk
philosophy
but
you
know
the
philosophizing
of
the
paltriest
does
not
harm
anyone
said
andrey
yefimitch
in
a
tone
as
if
he
wanted
to
cry
and
complain
why
then
that
malignant
laugh
my
friend
and
how
can
these
paltry
creatures
help
philosophizing
if
they
are
not
satisfied
for
an
intelligent
educated
man
made
in
god
image
proud
and
loving
freedom
to
have
no
alternative
but
to
be
a
doctor
in
a
filthy
stupid
wretched
little
town
and
to
spend
his
whole
life
among
bottles
leeches
mustard
plasters
quackery
narrowness
vulgarity
oh
my
god
you
are
talking
nonsense
if
you
do
like
being
a
doctor
you
should
have
gone
in
for
being
a
statesman
i
could
not
i
could
not
do
anything
we
are
weak
my
dear
friend
i
used
to
be
indifferent
i
reasoned
boldly
and
soundly
but
at
the
first
coarse
touch
of
life
upon
me
i
have
lost
heart
prostration
we
are
weak
we
are
poor
creatures
and
you
too
my
dear
friend
you
are
intelligent
generous
you
drew
in
good
impulses
with
your
mother
milk
but
you
had
hardly
entered
upon
life
when
you
were
exhausted
and
fell
weak
weak
andrey
yefimitch
was
all
the
while
at
the
approach
of
evening
tormented
by
another
persistent
sensation
besides
terror
and
the
feeling
of
resentment
at
last
he
realized
that
he
was
longing
for
a
smoke
and
for
beer
i
am
going
out
my
friend
he
said
i
will
tell
them
to
bring
a
light
i
ca
put
up
with
this
i
am
not
equal
to
it
andrey
yefimitch
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
but
at
once
nikita
jumped
up
and
barred
his
way
where
are
you
going
you
ca
you
ca
he
said
it
bedtime
but
i
only
going
out
for
a
minute
to
walk
about
the
yard
said
andrey
yefimitch
you
ca
you
ca
it
forbidden
you
know
that
yourself
but
what
difference
will
it
make
to
anyone
if
i
do
go
out
asked
andrey
yefimitch
shrugging
his
shoulders
i
do
understand
nikita
i
must
go
out
he
said
in
a
trembling
voice
i
must
do
be
disorderly
it
not
right
nikita
said
peremptorily
this
is
beyond
everything
ivan
dmitritch
cried
suddenly
and
he
jumped
up
what
right
has
he
not
to
let
you
out
how
dare
they
keep
us
here
i
believe
it
is
clearly
laid
down
in
the
law
that
no
one
can
be
deprived
of
freedom
without
trial
it
an
outrage
tyranny
of
course
it
tyranny
said
andrey
yefimitch
encouraged
by
ivan
dmitritch
outburst
i
must
go
out
i
want
to
he
has
no
right
open
i
tell
you
do
you
hear
you
brute
cried
ivan
dmitritch
and
he
banged
on
the
door
with
his
fist
open
the
door
or
i
will
break
it
open
torturer
open
the
door
cried
andrey
yefimitch
trembling
all
over
i
insist
talk
away
nikita
answered
through
the
door
talk
away
anyhow
go
and
call
yevgeny
fyodoritch
say
that
i
beg
him
to
come
for
a
minute
his
honour
will
come
of
himself
they
will
never
let
us
out
ivan
dmitritch
was
going
on
meanwhile
they
will
leave
us
to
rot
here
oh
lord
can
there
really
be
no
hell
in
the
next
world
and
will
these
wretches
be
forgiven
where
is
justice
open
the
door
you
wretch
i
am
choking
he
cried
in
a
hoarse
voice
and
flung
himself
upon
the
door
i
dash
out
my
brains
murderers
nikita
opened
the
door
quickly
and
roughly
with
both
his
hands
and
his
knee
shoved
andrey
yefimitch
back
then
swung
his
arm
and
punched
him
in
the
face
with
his
fist
it
seemed
to
andrey
yefimitch
as
though
a
huge
salt
wave
enveloped
him
from
his
head
downwards
and
dragged
him
to
the
bed
there
really
was
a
salt
taste
in
his
mouth
most
likely
the
blood
was
running
from
his
teeth
he
waved
his
arms
as
though
he
were
trying
to
swim
out
and
clutched
at
a
bedstead
and
at
the
same
moment
felt
nikita
hit
him
twice
on
the
back
ivan
dmitritch
gave
a
loud
scream
he
must
have
been
beaten
too
then
all
was
still
the
faint
moonlight
came
through
the
grating
and
a
shadow
like
a
net
lay
on
the
floor
it
was
terrible
andrey
yefimitch
lay
and
held
his
breath
he
was
expecting
with
horror
to
be
struck
again
he
felt
as
though
someone
had
taken
a
sickle
thrust
it
into
him
and
turned
it
round
several
times
in
his
breast
and
bowels
he
bit
the
pillow
from
pain
and
clenched
his
teeth
and
all
at
once
through
the
chaos
in
his
brain
there
flashed
the
terrible
unbearable
thought
that
these
people
who
seemed
now
like
black
shadows
in
the
moonlight
had
to
endure
such
pain
day
by
day
for
years
how
could
it
have
happened
that
for
more
than
twenty
years
he
had
not
known
it
and
had
refused
to
know
it
he
knew
nothing
of
pain
had
no
conception
of
it
so
he
was
not
to
blame
but
his
conscience
as
inexorable
and
as
rough
as
nikita
made
him
turn
cold
from
the
crown
of
his
head
to
his
heels
he
leaped
up
tried
to
cry
out
with
all
his
might
and
to
run
in
haste
to
kill
nikita
and
then
hobotov
the
superintendent
and
the
assistant
and
then
himself
but
no
sound
came
from
his
chest
and
his
legs
would
not
obey
him
gasping
for
breath
he
tore
at
the
and
the
shirt
on
his
breast
rent
them
and
fell
senseless
on
the
bed
xix
next
morning
his
head
ached
there
was
a
droning
in
his
ears
and
a
feeling
of
utter
weakness
all
over
he
was
not
ashamed
at
recalling
his
weakness
the
day
before
he
had
been
cowardly
had
even
been
afraid
of
the
moon
had
openly
expressed
thoughts
and
feelings
such
as
he
had
not
expected
in
himself
before
for
instance
the
thought
that
the
paltry
people
who
philosophized
were
really
dissatisfied
but
now
nothing
mattered
to
him
he
ate
nothing
he
drank
nothing
he
lay
motionless
and
silent
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
he
thought
when
they
asked
him
questions
i
am
not
going
to
answer
it
all
the
same
to
me
after
dinner
mihail
averyanitch
brought
him
a
quarter
pound
of
tea
and
a
pound
of
fruit
pastilles
daryushka
came
too
and
stood
for
a
whole
hour
by
the
bed
with
an
expression
of
dull
grief
on
her
face
hobotov
visited
him
he
brought
a
bottle
of
bromide
and
told
nikita
to
fumigate
the
ward
with
something
towards
evening
andrey
yefimitch
died
of
an
apoplectic
stroke
at
first
he
had
a
violent
shivering
fit
and
a
feeling
of
sickness
something
revolting
as
it
seemed
penetrating
through
his
whole
body
even
to
his
strained
from
his
stomach
to
his
head
and
flooded
his
eyes
and
ears
there
was
a
greenness
before
his
eyes
andrey
yefimitch
understood
that
his
end
had
come
and
remembered
that
ivan
dmitritch
mihail
averyanitch
and
millions
of
people
believed
in
immortality
and
what
if
it
really
existed
but
he
did
not
want
immortality
and
he
thought
of
it
only
for
one
instant
a
herd
of
deer
extraordinarily
beautiful
and
graceful
of
which
he
had
been
reading
the
day
before
ran
by
him
then
a
peasant
woman
stretched
out
her
hand
to
him
with
a
registered
letter
mihail
averyanitch
said
something
then
it
all
vanished
and
andrey
yefimitch
sank
into
oblivion
for
ever
the
hospital
porters
came
took
him
by
his
arms
and
legs
and
carried
him
away
to
the
chapel
there
he
lay
on
the
table
with
open
eyes
and
the
moon
shed
its
light
upon
him
at
night
in
the
morning
sergey
sergeyitch
came
prayed
piously
before
the
crucifix
and
closed
his
former
eyes
next
day
andrey
yefimitch
was
buried
mihail
averyanitch
and
daryushka
were
the
only
people
at
the
funeral
the
petchenyeg
ivan
abramitch
zhmuhin
a
retired
cossack
officer
who
had
once
served
in
the
caucasus
but
now
lived
on
his
own
farm
and
who
had
once
been
young
strong
and
vigorous
but
now
was
old
dried
up
and
bent
with
shaggy
eyebrows
and
a
moustache
was
returning
from
the
town
to
his
farm
one
hot
summer
day
in
the
town
he
had
confessed
and
received
absolution
and
had
made
his
will
at
the
notary
a
fortnight
before
he
had
had
a
slight
stroke
and
now
all
the
while
he
was
in
the
railway
carriage
he
was
haunted
by
melancholy
serious
thoughts
of
approaching
death
of
the
vanity
of
vanities
of
the
transitoriness
of
all
things
earthly
at
the
station
of
provalye
there
is
such
a
one
on
the
donetz
line
a
plump
gentleman
with
a
shabby
portfolio
stepped
into
the
carriage
and
sat
down
opposite
they
got
into
conversation
yes
said
ivan
abramitch
looking
pensively
out
of
window
it
is
never
too
late
to
marry
i
myself
married
when
i
was
i
was
told
it
was
late
but
it
has
turned
out
that
it
was
not
late
or
early
but
simply
that
it
would
have
been
better
not
to
marry
at
all
everyone
is
soon
tired
of
his
wife
but
not
everyone
tells
the
truth
because
you
know
people
are
ashamed
of
an
unhappy
home
life
and
conceal
it
it
this
and
that
with
many
a
man
by
his
wife
side
but
if
he
had
his
way
he
put
that
manya
in
a
sack
and
drop
her
in
the
water
it
dull
with
one
wife
it
mere
foolishness
and
it
no
better
with
one
children
i
make
bold
to
assure
you
i
have
two
of
them
the
rascals
nowhere
for
them
to
be
taught
out
here
in
the
steppe
i
have
the
money
to
send
them
to
school
in
novo
tcherkask
and
they
live
here
like
young
wolves
next
thing
they
will
be
murdering
someone
on
the
highroad
the
gentleman
listened
attentively
answered
questions
briefly
in
a
low
voice
and
was
apparently
a
gentleman
of
gentle
and
modest
disposition
he
mentioned
that
he
was
a
lawyer
and
that
he
was
going
to
the
village
dyuevka
on
business
why
merciful
heavens
that
is
six
miles
from
me
said
zhmuhin
in
a
tone
of
voice
as
though
someone
were
disputing
with
him
but
excuse
me
you
wo
find
horses
at
the
station
now
to
my
mind
the
very
best
thing
you
can
do
you
know
is
to
come
straight
to
me
stay
the
night
you
know
and
in
the
morning
drive
over
with
my
horses
the
lawyer
thought
a
moment
and
accepted
the
invitation
when
they
reached
the
station
the
sun
was
already
low
over
the
steppe
they
said
nothing
all
the
way
from
the
station
to
the
farm
the
jolting
prevented
conversation
the
trap
bounded
up
and
down
squeaked
and
seemed
to
be
sobbing
and
the
lawyer
who
was
sitting
very
uncomfortably
stared
before
him
miserably
hoping
to
see
the
farm
after
they
had
driven
five
or
six
miles
there
came
into
view
in
the
distance
a
house
and
a
yard
enclosed
by
a
fence
made
of
dark
flat
stones
standing
on
end
the
roof
was
green
the
stucco
was
peeling
off
and
the
windows
were
little
narrow
slits
like
eyes
the
farm
stood
in
the
full
sunshine
and
there
was
no
sign
either
of
water
or
trees
anywhere
round
among
the
neighbouring
landowners
and
the
peasants
it
was
known
as
the
petchenyegs
farm
many
years
before
a
land
surveyor
who
was
passing
through
the
neighbourhood
and
put
up
at
the
farm
spent
the
whole
night
talking
to
ivan
abramitch
was
not
favourably
impressed
and
as
he
was
driving
away
in
the
morning
said
to
him
grimly
you
are
a
petchenyeg
my
good
sir
the
petchenyegs
were
a
tribe
of
wild
mongolian
nomads
who
made
frequent
inroads
upon
the
russians
in
the
tenth
and
eleventh
from
this
came
the
nickname
the
petchenyegs
farm
which
stuck
to
the
place
even
more
when
zhmuhin
boys
grew
up
and
began
to
make
raids
on
the
orchards
and
ivan
abramitch
was
called
you
know
as
he
usually
talked
a
very
great
deal
and
frequently
made
use
of
that
expression
in
the
yard
near
a
barn
zhmuhin
sons
were
standing
one
a
young
man
of
nineteen
the
other
a
younger
lad
both
barefoot
and
bareheaded
just
at
the
moment
when
the
trap
drove
into
the
yard
the
younger
one
flung
high
up
a
hen
which
cackling
described
an
arc
in
the
air
the
elder
shot
at
it
with
a
gun
and
the
hen
fell
dead
on
the
earth
those
are
my
boys
learning
to
shoot
birds
flying
said
zhmuhin
in
the
entry
the
travellers
were
met
by
a
little
thin
woman
with
a
pale
face
still
young
and
beautiful
from
her
dress
she
might
have
been
taken
for
a
servant
and
this
allow
me
to
introduce
her
said
zhmuhin
is
the
mother
of
my
young
cubs
come
lyubov
osipovna
he
said
addressing
her
you
must
be
spry
mother
and
get
something
for
our
guest
let
us
have
supper
look
sharp
the
house
consisted
of
two
parts
in
one
was
the
parlour
and
beside
it
old
zhmuhin
bedroom
both
stuffy
rooms
with
low
ceilings
and
multitudes
of
flies
and
wasps
and
in
the
other
was
the
kitchen
in
which
the
cooking
and
washing
was
done
and
the
labourers
had
their
meals
here
geese
and
were
sitting
on
their
eggs
under
the
benches
and
here
were
the
beds
of
lyubov
osipovna
and
her
two
sons
the
furniture
in
the
parlour
was
unpainted
and
evidently
roughly
made
by
a
carpenter
guns
and
whips
were
hanging
on
the
walls
and
all
this
old
rubbish
was
covered
with
the
rust
of
years
and
looked
grey
with
dust
there
was
not
one
picture
in
the
corner
was
a
dingy
board
which
had
at
one
time
been
an
ikon
a
young
little
russian
woman
laid
the
table
and
handed
ham
then
beetroot
soup
the
visitor
refused
vodka
and
ate
only
bread
and
cucumbers
how
about
ham
asked
zhmuhin
thank
you
i
do
eat
it
answered
the
visitor
i
do
eat
meat
at
all
why
is
that
i
am
a
vegetarian
killing
animals
is
against
my
principles
zhmuhin
thought
a
minute
and
then
said
slowly
with
a
sigh
yes
to
be
sure
i
saw
a
man
who
did
not
eat
meat
in
town
too
it
a
new
religion
they
got
now
well
it
good
we
ca
go
on
always
shooting
and
slaughtering
you
know
we
must
give
it
up
some
day
and
leave
even
the
beasts
in
peace
it
a
sin
to
kill
it
a
sin
there
is
no
denying
it
sometimes
one
kills
a
hare
and
wounds
him
in
the
leg
and
he
cries
like
a
child
so
it
must
hurt
him
of
course
it
hurts
him
animals
suffer
just
like
human
beings
that
true
zhmuhin
assented
i
understand
that
very
well
he
went
on
musing
only
there
is
this
one
thing
i
do
understand
suppose
you
know
everyone
gave
up
eating
meat
what
would
become
of
the
domestic
animals
fowls
and
geese
for
instance
fowls
and
geese
would
live
in
freedom
like
wild
birds
now
i
understand
to
be
sure
crows
and
jackdaws
get
on
all
right
without
us
yes
fowls
and
geese
and
hares
and
sheep
all
will
live
in
freedom
rejoicing
you
know
and
praising
god
and
they
will
not
fear
us
peace
and
concord
will
come
only
there
is
one
thing
you
know
i
ca
understand
zhmuhin
went
on
glancing
at
the
ham
how
will
it
be
with
the
pigs
what
is
to
be
done
with
them
they
will
be
like
all
the
rest
that
is
they
will
live
in
freedom
ah
yes
but
allow
me
to
say
if
they
were
not
slaughtered
they
would
multiply
you
know
and
then
to
the
and
the
meadows
why
a
pig
if
you
let
it
free
and
do
look
after
it
will
ruin
everything
in
a
day
a
pig
is
a
pig
and
it
is
not
for
nothing
it
is
called
a
pig
they
finished
supper
zhmuhin
got
up
from
the
table
and
for
a
long
while
walked
up
and
down
the
room
talking
and
talking
he
was
fond
of
talking
of
something
important
or
serious
and
was
fond
of
meditating
and
in
his
old
age
he
had
a
longing
to
reach
some
haven
to
be
reassured
that
he
might
not
be
so
frightened
of
dying
he
had
a
longing
for
meekness
spiritual
calm
and
confidence
in
himself
such
as
this
guest
of
theirs
had
who
had
satisfied
his
hunger
on
cucumbers
and
bread
and
believed
that
doing
so
made
him
more
perfect
he
was
sitting
on
a
chest
plump
and
healthy
keeping
silent
and
patiently
enduring
his
boredom
and
in
the
dusk
when
one
glanced
at
him
from
the
entry
he
looked
like
a
big
round
stone
which
one
could
not
move
from
its
place
if
a
man
has
something
to
lay
hold
of
in
life
he
is
all
right
zhmuhin
went
through
the
entry
to
the
porch
and
then
he
could
be
heard
sighing
and
saying
reflectively
to
himself
yes
to
be
sure
by
now
it
was
dark
and
here
and
there
stars
could
be
seen
in
the
sky
they
had
not
yet
lighted
up
indoors
someone
came
into
the
parlour
as
noiselessly
as
a
shadow
and
stood
still
near
the
door
it
was
lyubov
osipovna
zhmuhin
wife
are
you
from
the
town
she
asked
timidly
not
looking
at
her
visitor
yes
i
live
in
the
town
perhaps
you
are
something
in
the
learned
way
sir
be
so
kind
as
to
advise
us
we
ought
to
send
in
a
petition
to
whom
asked
the
visitor
we
have
two
sons
kind
gentleman
and
they
ought
to
have
been
sent
to
school
long
ago
but
we
never
see
anyone
and
have
no
one
to
advise
us
and
i
know
nothing
for
if
they
are
not
taught
they
will
have
to
serve
in
the
army
as
common
cossacks
it
not
right
sir
they
ca
read
and
write
they
are
worse
than
peasants
and
ivan
abramitch
himself
ca
stand
them
and
wo
let
them
indoors
but
they
are
not
to
blame
the
younger
one
at
any
rate
ought
to
be
sent
to
school
it
is
such
a
pity
she
said
slowly
and
there
was
a
quiver
in
her
voice
and
it
seemed
incredible
that
a
woman
so
small
and
so
youthful
could
have
children
oh
it
such
a
pity
you
do
know
anything
about
it
mother
and
it
is
not
your
affair
said
zhmuhin
appearing
in
the
doorway
do
pester
our
guest
with
your
wild
talk
go
away
mother
lyubov
osipovna
went
out
and
in
the
entry
repeated
once
more
in
a
thin
little
voice
oh
it
such
a
pity
a
bed
was
made
up
for
the
visitor
on
the
sofa
in
the
parlour
and
that
it
might
not
be
dark
for
him
they
lighted
the
lamp
before
the
ikon
zhmuhin
went
to
bed
in
his
own
room
and
as
he
lay
there
he
thought
of
his
soul
of
his
age
of
his
recent
stroke
which
had
so
frightened
him
and
made
him
think
of
death
he
was
fond
of
philosophizing
when
he
was
in
quietness
by
himself
and
then
he
fancied
that
he
was
a
very
earnest
deep
thinker
and
that
nothing
in
this
world
interested
him
but
serious
questions
and
now
he
kept
thinking
and
he
longed
to
pitch
upon
some
one
significant
thought
unlike
others
which
would
be
a
guide
to
him
in
life
and
he
wanted
to
think
out
principles
of
some
sort
for
himself
so
as
to
make
his
life
as
deep
and
earnest
as
he
imagined
that
he
felt
himself
to
be
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
an
old
man
like
him
to
abstain
altogether
from
meat
from
superfluities
of
all
sorts
the
time
when
men
give
up
killing
each
other
and
animals
would
come
sooner
or
later
it
could
not
but
be
so
and
he
imagined
that
time
to
himself
and
clearly
pictured
himself
living
in
peace
with
all
the
animals
and
suddenly
he
thought
again
of
the
pigs
and
everything
was
in
a
tangle
in
his
brain
it
a
queer
business
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
he
muttered
sighing
heavily
are
you
asleep
he
asked
no
zhmuhin
got
out
of
bed
and
stopped
in
the
doorway
with
nothing
but
his
shirt
on
displaying
to
his
guest
his
sinewy
legs
that
looked
as
dry
as
sticks
nowadays
you
know
he
began
all
sorts
of
telegraphs
telephones
and
marvels
of
all
kinds
in
fact
have
come
in
but
people
are
no
better
than
they
were
they
say
that
in
our
day
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
men
were
coarse
and
cruel
but
is
it
just
the
same
now
we
certainly
did
not
stand
on
ceremony
in
our
day
i
remember
in
the
caucasus
when
we
were
stationed
by
a
little
river
with
nothing
to
do
for
four
whole
months
i
was
an
at
that
time
something
queer
happened
quite
in
the
style
of
a
novel
just
on
the
banks
of
that
river
you
know
where
our
division
was
encamped
a
wretched
prince
whom
we
had
killed
not
long
before
was
buried
and
at
night
you
know
the
princess
used
to
come
to
his
grave
and
weep
she
would
wail
and
wail
and
moan
and
moan
and
make
us
so
depressed
we
could
sleep
and
that
the
fact
we
could
sleep
one
night
we
could
sleep
a
second
well
we
got
sick
of
it
and
from
a
point
of
view
you
really
ca
go
without
your
sleep
for
the
devil
knows
what
excuse
the
expression
we
took
that
princess
and
gave
her
a
good
thrashing
and
she
gave
up
coming
there
an
instance
for
you
nowadays
of
course
there
is
not
the
same
class
of
people
and
they
are
not
given
to
thrashing
and
they
live
in
cleaner
style
and
there
is
more
learning
but
you
know
the
soul
is
just
the
same
there
is
no
change
now
look
here
there
a
landowner
living
here
among
us
he
has
mines
you
know
all
sorts
of
tramps
without
passports
who
do
know
where
to
go
work
for
him
on
saturdays
he
has
to
settle
up
with
the
workmen
but
he
does
care
to
pay
them
you
know
he
grudges
the
money
so
he
got
hold
of
a
foreman
who
is
a
tramp
too
though
he
does
wear
a
hat
you
pay
them
anything
he
says
a
kopeck
they
beat
you
and
let
them
beat
you
says
he
you
put
up
with
it
and
i
pay
you
ten
roubles
every
saturday
for
it
so
on
the
saturday
evening
the
workmen
come
to
settle
up
in
the
usual
way
the
foreman
says
to
them
well
word
for
word
as
the
master
said
they
begin
swearing
and
using
their
fists
they
beat
him
and
they
kick
him
you
know
they
are
a
set
of
men
brutalized
by
hunger
they
beat
him
till
he
is
senseless
and
then
they
go
each
on
his
way
the
master
gives
orders
for
cold
water
to
be
poured
on
the
foreman
then
flings
ten
roubles
in
his
face
and
he
takes
it
and
is
pleased
too
for
indeed
he
be
ready
to
be
hanged
for
three
roubles
let
alone
ten
yes
and
on
monday
a
new
gang
of
workmen
arrive
they
work
for
they
have
nowhere
to
go
on
saturday
it
is
the
same
story
over
again
the
visitor
turned
over
on
the
other
side
with
his
face
to
the
back
of
the
sofa
and
muttered
something
and
here
another
instance
zhmuhin
went
on
we
had
the
siberian
plague
here
you
know
the
cattle
die
off
like
flies
i
can
tell
you
and
the
veterinary
surgeons
came
here
and
strict
orders
were
given
that
the
dead
cattle
were
to
be
buried
at
a
distance
deep
in
the
earth
that
lime
was
to
be
thrown
over
them
and
so
on
you
know
on
scientific
principles
my
horse
died
too
i
buried
it
with
every
precaution
and
threw
over
three
hundredweight
of
lime
over
it
and
what
do
you
think
my
fine
fellows
my
precious
sons
i
mean
dug
it
up
skinned
it
and
sold
the
hide
for
three
roubles
there
an
instance
for
you
so
people
have
grown
no
better
and
however
you
feed
a
wolf
he
will
always
look
towards
the
forest
there
it
is
it
gives
one
something
to
think
about
eh
how
do
you
look
at
it
on
one
side
a
flash
of
lightning
gleamed
through
a
chink
in
the
there
was
the
stifling
feeling
of
a
storm
coming
the
gnats
were
biting
and
zhmuhin
as
he
lay
in
his
bedroom
meditating
sighed
and
groaned
and
said
to
himself
yes
to
be
sure
and
there
was
no
possibility
of
getting
to
sleep
somewhere
far
far
away
there
was
a
growl
of
thunder
are
you
asleep
no
answered
the
visitor
zhmuhin
got
up
and
thudding
with
his
heels
walked
through
the
parlour
and
the
entry
to
the
kitchen
to
get
a
drink
of
water
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
you
know
is
stupidity
he
said
a
little
later
coming
back
with
a
dipper
my
lyubov
osipovna
is
on
her
knees
saying
her
prayers
she
prays
every
night
you
know
and
bows
down
to
the
ground
first
that
her
children
may
be
sent
to
school
she
is
afraid
her
boys
will
go
into
the
army
as
simple
cossacks
and
that
they
will
be
whacked
across
their
backs
with
sabres
but
for
teaching
one
must
have
money
and
where
is
one
to
get
it
you
may
break
the
floor
beating
your
head
against
it
but
if
you
have
got
it
you
have
and
the
other
reason
she
prays
is
because
you
know
every
woman
imagines
there
is
no
one
in
the
world
as
unhappy
as
she
is
i
am
a
man
and
i
want
to
conceal
anything
from
you
she
comes
of
a
poor
family
a
village
priest
daughter
i
married
her
when
she
was
seventeen
and
they
accepted
my
offer
chiefly
because
they
had
enough
to
eat
it
was
nothing
but
poverty
and
misery
while
i
have
anyway
land
you
see
a
farm
and
after
all
i
am
an
officer
it
was
a
step
up
for
her
to
marry
me
you
know
on
the
very
first
day
when
she
was
married
she
cried
and
she
has
been
crying
ever
since
all
these
twenty
years
she
has
got
a
watery
eye
and
she
always
sitting
and
thinking
and
what
do
you
suppose
she
is
thinking
about
what
can
a
woman
think
about
why
nothing
i
must
own
i
consider
a
woman
a
human
being
the
visitor
got
up
abruptly
and
sat
on
the
bed
excuse
me
i
feel
stifled
he
said
i
will
go
outside
zhmuhin
still
talking
about
women
drew
the
bolt
in
the
entry
and
they
both
went
out
a
full
moon
was
floating
in
the
sky
just
over
the
yard
and
in
the
moonlight
the
house
and
barn
looked
whiter
than
by
day
and
on
the
grass
brilliant
streaks
of
moonlight
white
too
stretched
between
the
black
shadows
far
away
on
the
right
could
be
seen
the
steppe
above
it
the
stars
were
softly
glowing
and
it
was
all
mysterious
infinitely
far
away
as
though
one
were
gazing
into
a
deep
abyss
while
on
the
left
heavy
black
as
soot
were
piling
up
one
upon
another
above
the
steppe
their
edges
were
lighted
up
by
the
moon
and
it
looked
as
though
there
were
mountains
there
with
white
snow
on
their
peaks
dark
forests
the
sea
there
was
a
flash
of
lightning
a
faint
rumble
of
thunder
and
it
seemed
as
though
a
battle
were
being
fought
in
the
mountains
quite
close
to
the
house
a
little
screeched
monotonously
asleep
asleep
what
time
is
it
now
asked
the
visitor
just
after
one
how
long
it
is
still
to
dawn
they
went
back
to
the
house
and
lay
down
again
it
was
time
to
sleep
and
one
can
usually
sleep
so
splendidly
before
rain
but
the
old
man
had
a
hankering
after
serious
weighty
thoughts
he
wanted
not
simply
to
think
but
to
meditate
and
he
meditated
how
good
it
would
be
as
death
was
near
at
hand
for
the
sake
of
his
soul
to
give
up
the
idleness
which
so
imperceptibly
swallowed
up
day
after
day
year
after
year
leaving
no
trace
to
think
out
for
himself
some
great
exploit
for
instance
to
walk
on
foot
far
far
away
or
to
give
up
meat
like
this
young
man
and
again
he
pictured
to
himself
the
time
when
animals
would
not
be
killed
pictured
it
clearly
and
distinctly
as
though
he
were
living
through
that
time
himself
but
suddenly
it
was
all
in
a
tangle
again
in
his
head
and
all
was
muddled
the
thunderstorm
had
passed
over
but
from
the
edges
of
the
came
rain
softly
pattering
on
the
roof
zhmuhin
got
up
stretching
and
groaning
with
old
age
and
looked
into
the
parlour
noticing
that
his
visitor
was
not
asleep
he
said
when
we
were
in
the
caucasus
you
know
there
was
a
colonel
there
who
was
a
vegetarian
too
he
did
eat
meat
never
went
shooting
and
would
not
let
his
servants
catch
fish
of
course
i
understand
that
every
animal
ought
to
live
in
freedom
and
enjoy
its
life
only
i
do
understand
how
a
pig
can
go
about
where
it
likes
without
being
looked
after
the
visitor
got
up
and
sat
down
his
pale
haggard
face
expressed
weariness
and
vexation
it
was
evident
that
he
was
exhausted
and
only
his
gentleness
and
the
delicacy
of
his
soul
prevented
him
from
expressing
his
vexation
in
words
it
getting
light
he
said
mildly
please
have
the
horse
brought
round
for
me
why
so
wait
a
little
and
the
rain
will
be
over
no
i
entreat
you
said
the
visitor
in
horror
with
a
supplicating
voice
it
is
essential
for
me
to
go
at
once
and
he
began
hurriedly
dressing
by
the
time
the
horse
was
harnessed
the
sun
was
rising
it
had
just
left
off
raining
the
clouds
were
racing
swiftly
by
and
the
patches
of
blue
were
growing
bigger
and
bigger
in
the
sky
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
were
timidly
reflected
below
in
the
big
puddles
the
visitor
walked
through
the
entry
with
his
portfolio
to
get
into
the
trap
and
at
that
moment
zhmuhin
wife
pale
and
it
seemed
paler
than
the
day
before
with
eyes
looked
at
him
intently
without
blinking
with
the
naïve
expression
of
a
little
girl
and
it
was
evident
from
her
dejected
face
that
she
was
envying
him
his
freedom
oh
with
what
joy
she
would
have
gone
away
from
there
and
she
wanted
to
say
something
to
him
most
likely
to
ask
advice
about
her
children
and
what
a
pitiable
figure
she
was
this
was
not
a
wife
not
the
head
of
a
house
not
even
a
servant
but
more
like
a
dependent
a
poor
relation
not
wanted
by
anyone
a
nonentity
her
husband
fussing
about
talking
unceasingly
was
seeing
his
visitor
off
continually
running
in
front
of
him
while
she
huddled
up
to
the
wall
with
a
timid
guilty
air
waiting
for
a
convenient
minute
to
speak
please
come
again
another
time
the
old
man
kept
repeating
incessantly
what
we
have
we
are
glad
to
offer
you
know
the
visitor
hurriedly
got
into
the
trap
evidently
with
relief
as
though
he
were
afraid
every
minute
that
they
would
detain
him
the
trap
lurched
about
as
it
had
the
day
before
squeaked
and
furiously
rattled
the
pail
that
was
tied
on
at
the
back
he
glanced
round
at
zhmuhin
with
a
peculiar
expression
it
looked
as
though
he
wanted
to
call
him
a
petchenyeg
as
the
surveyor
had
once
done
or
some
such
name
but
his
gentleness
got
the
upper
hand
he
controlled
himself
and
said
nothing
but
in
the
gateway
he
suddenly
could
not
restrain
himself
he
got
up
and
shouted
loudly
and
angrily
you
have
bored
me
to
death
and
he
disappeared
through
the
gate
near
the
barn
zhmuhin
sons
were
standing
the
elder
held
a
gun
while
the
younger
had
in
his
hands
a
grey
cockerel
with
a
bright
red
comb
the
younger
flung
up
the
cockerel
with
all
his
might
the
bird
flew
upwards
higher
than
the
house
and
turned
over
in
the
air
like
a
pigeon
the
elder
boy
fired
and
the
cockerel
fell
like
a
stone
the
old
man
overcome
with
confusion
not
knowing
how
to
explain
the
visitor
strange
unexpected
shout
went
slowly
back
into
the
house
and
sitting
down
at
the
table
he
spent
a
long
while
meditating
on
the
intellectual
tendencies
of
the
day
on
the
universal
immorality
on
the
telegraph
on
the
telephone
on
velocipedes
on
how
unnecessary
it
all
was
little
by
little
he
regained
his
composure
then
slowly
had
a
meal
drank
five
glasses
of
tea
and
lay
down
for
a
nap
a
dead
body
a
still
august
night
a
mist
is
rising
slowly
from
the
fields
and
casting
an
opaque
veil
over
everything
within
eyesight
lighted
up
by
the
moon
the
mist
gives
the
impression
at
one
moment
of
a
calm
boundless
sea
at
the
next
of
an
immense
white
wall
the
air
is
damp
and
chilly
morning
is
still
far
off
a
step
from
the
which
runs
along
the
edge
of
the
forest
a
little
fire
is
gleaming
a
dead
body
covered
from
head
to
foot
with
new
white
linen
is
lying
under
a
young
a
wooden
ikon
is
lying
on
its
breast
beside
the
corpse
almost
on
the
road
sits
the
watch
two
peasants
performing
one
of
the
most
disagreeable
and
uninviting
of
duties
one
a
tall
young
fellow
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
moustache
and
thick
black
eyebrows
in
a
tattered
sheepskin
and
bark
shoes
is
sitting
on
the
wet
grass
his
feet
stuck
out
straight
in
front
of
him
and
is
trying
to
while
away
the
time
with
work
he
bends
his
long
neck
and
breathing
loudly
through
his
nose
makes
a
spoon
out
of
a
big
crooked
bit
of
wood
the
other
a
little
scraggy
peasant
with
an
aged
face
a
scanty
moustache
and
a
little
goat
beard
sits
with
his
hands
dangling
loose
on
his
knees
and
without
moving
gazes
listlessly
at
the
light
a
small
is
lazily
burning
down
between
them
throwing
a
red
glow
on
their
faces
there
is
perfect
stillness
the
only
sounds
are
the
scrape
of
the
knife
on
the
wood
and
the
crackling
of
damp
sticks
in
the
fire
do
you
go
to
sleep
syoma
says
the
young
man
i
i
am
not
asleep
stammers
the
that
all
right
it
would
be
dreadful
to
sit
here
alone
one
would
be
frightened
you
might
tell
me
something
syoma
you
are
a
queer
fellow
syomushka
other
people
will
laugh
and
tell
a
story
and
sing
a
song
but
you
there
is
no
making
you
out
you
sit
like
a
scarecrow
in
the
garden
and
roll
your
eyes
at
the
fire
you
ca
say
anything
properly
when
you
speak
you
seem
frightened
i
dare
say
you
are
fifty
but
you
have
less
sense
than
a
child
are
you
sorry
that
you
are
a
simpleton
i
am
sorry
the
answers
gloomily
and
we
are
sorry
to
see
your
foolishness
you
may
be
sure
you
are
a
sober
peasant
and
the
only
trouble
is
that
you
have
no
sense
in
your
head
you
should
have
picked
up
some
sense
for
yourself
if
the
lord
has
afflicted
you
and
given
you
no
understanding
you
must
make
an
effort
syoma
you
should
listen
hard
when
anything
good
being
said
note
it
well
and
keep
thinking
and
thinking
if
there
is
any
word
you
do
understand
you
should
make
an
effort
and
think
over
in
your
head
in
what
meaning
the
word
is
used
do
you
see
make
an
effort
if
you
do
gain
some
sense
for
yourself
you
be
a
simpleton
and
of
no
account
at
all
to
your
dying
day
all
at
once
a
long
moaning
sound
is
heard
in
the
forest
something
rustles
in
the
leaves
as
though
torn
from
the
very
top
of
the
tree
and
falls
to
the
ground
all
this
is
faintly
repeated
by
the
echo
the
young
man
shudders
and
looks
enquiringly
at
his
companion
it
an
owl
at
the
little
birds
says
syoma
gloomily
why
syoma
it
time
for
the
birds
to
fly
to
the
warm
countries
to
be
sure
it
is
time
it
is
chilly
at
dawn
now
it
is
the
crane
is
a
chilly
creature
it
is
tender
such
cold
is
death
to
it
i
am
not
a
crane
but
i
am
frozen
put
some
more
wood
on
syoma
gets
up
and
disappears
in
the
dark
undergrowth
while
he
is
busy
among
the
bushes
breaking
dry
twigs
his
companion
puts
his
hand
over
his
eyes
and
starts
at
every
sound
syoma
brings
an
armful
of
wood
and
lays
it
on
the
fire
the
flame
irresolutely
licks
the
black
twigs
with
its
little
tongues
then
suddenly
as
though
at
the
word
of
command
catches
them
and
throws
a
crimson
light
on
the
faces
the
road
the
white
linen
with
its
prominences
where
the
hands
and
feet
of
the
corpse
raise
it
the
ikon
the
watch
is
silent
the
young
man
bends
his
neck
still
lower
and
sets
to
work
with
still
more
nervous
haste
the
sits
motionless
as
before
and
keeps
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
fire
ye
that
love
not
zion
shall
be
put
to
shame
by
the
lord
a
falsetto
voice
is
suddenly
heard
singing
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
then
slow
footsteps
are
audible
and
the
dark
figure
of
a
man
in
a
short
monkish
cassock
and
a
hat
with
a
wallet
on
his
shoulders
comes
into
sight
on
the
road
in
the
crimson
firelight
thy
will
be
done
o
lord
holy
mother
the
figure
says
in
a
husky
falsetto
i
saw
the
fire
in
the
outer
darkness
and
my
soul
leapt
for
joy
at
first
i
thought
it
was
men
grazing
a
drove
of
horses
then
i
thought
it
ca
be
that
since
no
horses
were
to
be
seen
they
thieves
i
wondered
they
robbers
lying
in
wait
for
a
rich
lazarus
are
they
the
gypsy
people
offering
sacrifices
to
idols
and
my
soul
leapt
for
joy
feodosy
servant
of
god
i
said
to
myself
win
a
crown
and
i
flew
to
the
fire
like
a
moth
now
i
stand
before
you
and
from
your
outer
aspect
i
judge
of
your
souls
you
are
not
thieves
and
you
are
not
heathens
peace
be
to
you
good
orthodox
people
do
you
know
how
to
reach
the
makuhinsky
brickyards
from
here
it
close
here
you
go
straight
along
the
road
when
you
have
gone
a
mile
and
a
half
there
will
be
ananova
our
village
from
the
village
father
you
turn
to
the
right
by
the
and
so
you
will
get
to
the
brickyards
it
two
miles
from
ananova
god
give
you
health
and
why
are
you
sitting
here
we
are
sitting
here
watching
you
see
there
is
a
dead
body
what
what
body
holy
mother
the
pilgrim
sees
the
white
linen
with
the
ikon
on
it
and
starts
so
violently
that
his
legs
give
a
little
skip
this
unexpected
sight
has
an
overpowering
effect
upon
him
he
huddles
together
and
stands
as
though
rooted
to
the
spot
with
mouth
and
staring
eyes
for
three
minutes
he
is
silent
as
though
he
could
not
believe
his
eyes
then
begins
muttering
o
lord
holy
mother
i
was
going
along
not
meddling
with
anyone
and
all
at
once
such
an
affliction
what
may
you
be
enquires
the
young
man
of
the
clergy
no
no
i
go
from
one
monastery
to
another
do
you
know
mi
mihail
polikarpitch
the
foreman
of
the
brickyard
well
i
am
his
nephew
thy
will
be
done
o
lord
why
are
you
here
we
are
watching
we
are
told
to
yes
yes
mutters
the
man
in
the
cassock
passing
his
hand
over
his
eyes
and
where
did
the
deceased
come
from
he
was
a
stranger
such
is
life
but
i
er
be
getting
on
brothers
i
feel
flustered
i
am
more
afraid
of
the
dead
than
of
anything
my
dear
souls
and
only
fancy
while
this
man
was
alive
he
noticed
while
now
when
he
is
dead
and
given
over
to
corruption
we
tremble
before
him
as
before
some
famous
general
or
a
bishop
such
is
life
was
he
murdered
or
what
the
lord
knows
maybe
he
was
murdered
or
maybe
he
died
of
himself
yes
yes
who
knows
brothers
maybe
his
soul
is
now
tasting
the
joys
of
paradise
his
soul
is
still
hovering
here
near
his
body
says
the
young
man
it
does
not
depart
from
the
body
for
three
days
h
yes
how
chilly
the
nights
are
now
it
sets
one
teeth
chattering
so
then
i
am
to
go
straight
on
and
on
till
you
get
to
the
village
and
then
you
turn
to
the
right
by
the
by
the
to
be
sure
why
am
i
standing
still
i
must
go
on
farewell
brothers
the
man
in
the
cassock
takes
five
steps
along
the
road
and
stops
i
forgotten
to
put
a
kopeck
for
the
burying
he
says
good
orthodox
friends
can
i
give
the
money
you
ought
to
know
best
you
go
the
round
of
the
monasteries
if
he
died
a
natural
death
it
would
go
for
the
good
of
his
soul
if
it
a
suicide
it
a
sin
that
true
and
maybe
it
really
was
a
suicide
so
i
had
better
keep
my
money
oh
sins
sins
give
me
a
thousand
roubles
and
i
would
not
consent
to
sit
here
farewell
brothers
the
cassock
slowly
moves
away
and
stops
again
i
ca
make
up
my
mind
what
i
am
to
do
he
mutters
to
stay
here
by
the
fire
and
wait
till
daybreak
i
am
frightened
to
go
on
is
dreadful
too
the
dead
man
will
haunt
me

the
way

the
darkness

lord
has
chastised
me
indeed
over
three
hundred
miles
i
have
come
on
foot
and
nothing
happened
and
now
i
am
near
home
and
there

i
ca
go
on
it
is
dreadful
that
is
true
i
am
not
afraid
of
wolves
of
thieves
or
of
darkness
but
i
am
afraid
of
the
dead

am
afraid
of
them
and

is
all
about

good
orthodox
brothers
i
entreat

young
man

kopecks

the
young
man
scratching
his
head
but

alone

simpleton
consents
well
that
all
right
then
come
along
the
young
man
gets
up
and
goes
with
the
cassock
a
minute
later
the
sound
of
their
steps
and
their
talk
dies
away
syoma
shuts
his
eyes
and
gently
dozes
the
fire
begins
to
grow
dim
and
a
big
black
shadow
falls
on
the
dead
body
a
happy
ending
lyubov
grigoryevna
a
substantial
buxom
lady
of
forty
who
undertook
matchmaking
and
many
other
matters
of
which
it
is
usual
to
speak
only
in
whispers
had
come
to
see
stytchkin
the
head
guard
on
a
day
when
he
was
off
duty
stytchkin
somewhat
embarrassed
but
as
always
grave
practical
and
severe
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
smoking
a
cigar
and
saying
very
pleased
to
make
your
acquaintance
semyon
ivanovitch
recommended
you
on
the
ground
that
you
may
be
able
to
assist
me
in
a
delicate
and
very
important
matter
affecting
the
happiness
of
my
life
i
have
lyubov
grigoryevna
reached
the
age
of
that
is
a
period
of
life
at
which
very
many
have
already
children
my
position
is
a
secure
one
though
my
fortune
is
not
large
yet
i
am
in
a
position
to
support
a
beloved
being
and
children
at
my
side
i
may
tell
you
between
ourselves
that
apart
from
my
salary
i
have
also
money
in
the
bank
which
my
manner
of
living
has
enabled
me
to
save
i
am
a
practical
and
sober
man
i
lead
a
sensible
and
consistent
life
so
that
i
may
hold
myself
up
as
an
example
to
many
but
one
thing
i
lack
a
domestic
hearth
of
my
own
and
a
partner
in
life
and
i
live
like
a
wandering
magyar
moving
from
place
to
place
without
any
satisfaction
i
have
no
one
with
whom
to
take
counsel
and
when
i
am
ill
no
one
to
give
me
water
and
so
on
apart
from
that
lyubov
grigoryevna
a
married
man
has
always
more
weight
in
society
than
a
bachelor
i
am
a
man
of
the
educated
class
with
money
but
if
you
look
at
me
from
a
point
of
view
what
am
i
a
man
with
no
kith
and
kin
no
better
than
some
polish
priest
and
therefore
i
should
be
very
desirous
to
be
united
in
the
bonds
of
hymen
that
is
to
enter
into
matrimony
with
some
worthy
person
an
excellent
thing
said
the
matchmaker
with
a
sigh
i
am
a
solitary
man
and
in
this
town
i
know
no
one
where
can
i
go
and
to
whom
can
i
apply
since
all
the
people
here
are
strangers
to
me
that
is
why
semyon
ivanovitch
advised
me
to
address
myself
to
a
person
who
is
a
specialist
in
this
line
and
makes
the
arrangement
of
the
happiness
of
others
her
profession
and
therefore
i
most
earnestly
beg
you
lyubov
grigoryevna
to
assist
me
in
ordering
my
future
you
know
all
the
marriageable
young
ladies
in
the
town
and
it
is
easy
for
you
to
accommodate
me
i
can
a
glass
of
wine
i
beg
you
with
an
habitual
gesture
the
matchmaker
raised
her
glass
to
her
mouth
and
tossed
it
off
without
winking
i
can
she
repeated
and
what
sort
of
bride
would
you
like
nikolay
nikolayitch
should
i
like
the
bride
fate
sends
me
well
of
course
it
depends
on
your
fate
but
everyone
has
his
own
taste
you
know
one
likes
dark
ladies
the
other
prefers
fair
ones
you
see
lyubov
grigoryevna
said
stytchkin
sighing
sedately
i
am
a
practical
man
and
a
man
of
character
for
me
beauty
and
external
appearance
generally
take
a
secondary
place
for
as
you
know
yourself
beauty
is
neither
bowl
nor
platter
and
a
pretty
wife
involves
a
great
deal
of
anxiety
the
way
i
look
at
it
is
what
matters
most
in
a
woman
is
not
what
is
external
but
what
lies
within
that
is
that
she
should
have
soul
and
all
the
qualities
a
glass
of
wine
i
beg
of
course
it
would
be
very
agreeable
that
one
wife
should
be
rather
plump
but
for
mutual
happiness
it
is
not
of
great
consequence
what
matters
is
the
mind
properly
speaking
a
woman
does
not
need
mind
either
for
if
she
has
brains
she
will
have
too
high
an
opinion
of
herself
and
take
all
sorts
of
ideas
into
her
head
one
can
not
do
without
education
nowadays
of
course
but
education
is
of
different
kinds
it
would
be
pleasing
for
one
wife
to
know
french
and
german
to
speak
various
languages
very
pleasing
but
what
the
use
of
that
if
she
ca
sew
on
buttons
perhaps
i
am
a
man
of
the
educated
class
i
am
just
as
much
at
home
i
may
say
with
prince
kanitelin
as
i
am
with
you
here
now
but
my
habits
are
simple
and
i
want
a
girl
who
is
not
too
much
a
fine
lady
above
all
she
must
have
respect
for
me
and
feel
that
i
have
made
her
happiness
to
be
sure
well
now
as
regards
the
essential
i
do
not
want
a
wealthy
bride
i
would
never
condescend
to
anything
so
low
as
to
marry
for
money
i
desire
not
to
be
kept
by
my
wife
but
to
keep
her
and
that
she
may
be
sensible
of
it
but
i
do
not
want
a
poor
girl
either
though
i
am
a
man
of
means
and
am
marrying
not
from
mercenary
motives
but
from
love
yet
i
can
not
take
a
poor
girl
for
as
you
know
yourself
prices
have
gone
up
so
and
there
will
be
children
one
might
find
one
with
a
dowry
said
the
matchmaker
a
glass
of
wine
i
beg
there
was
a
pause
of
five
minutes
the
matchmaker
heaved
a
sigh
took
a
sidelong
glance
at
the
guard
and
asked
well
now
my
good
sir
do
you
want
anything
in
the
bachelor
line
i
have
some
fine
bargains
one
is
a
french
girl
and
one
is
a
greek
well
worth
the
money
the
guard
thought
a
moment
and
said
no
i
thank
you
in
view
of
your
favourable
disposition
allow
me
to
enquire
now
how
much
you
ask
for
your
exertions
in
regard
to
a
bride
i
do
ask
much
give
me
roubles
and
the
stuff
for
a
dress
as
is
usual
and
i
will
say
thank
you
but
for
the
dowry
that
a
different
account
stytchkin
folded
his
arms
over
his
chest
and
fell
to
pondering
in
silence
after
some
thought
he
heaved
a
sigh
and
said
that
dear
it
not
at
all
dear
nikolay
nikolayitch
in
old
days
when
there
were
lots
of
weddings
one
did
do
it
cheaper
but
nowadays
what
are
our
earnings
if
you
make
fifty
roubles
in
a
month
that
is
not
a
fast
you
may
be
thankful
it
not
on
weddings
we
make
our
money
my
good
sir
stytchkin
looked
at
the
matchmaker
in
amazement
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
h
do
you
call
fifty
roubles
little
he
asked
of
course
it
is
little
in
old
days
we
sometimes
made
more
than
a
hundred
h
i
should
never
have
thought
it
was
possible
to
earn
such
a
sum
by
these
jobs
fifty
roubles
it
is
not
every
man
that
earns
as
much
pray
drink
your
wine
the
matchmaker
drained
her
glass
without
winking
stytchkin
looked
her
over
from
head
to
foot
in
silence
then
said
fifty
roubles
why
that
is
six
hundred
roubles
a
year
please
take
some
more
with
such
dividends
you
know
lyubov
grigoryevna
you
would
have
no
difficulty
in
making
a
match
for
yourself
for
myself
laughed
the
matchmaker
i
am
an
old
woman
not
at
all
you
have
such
a
figure
and
your
face
is
plump
and
fair
and
all
the
rest
of
it
the
matchmaker
was
embarrassed
stytchkin
was
also
embarrassed
and
sat
down
beside
her
you
are
still
very
attractive
said
he
if
you
met
with
a
practical
steady
careful
husband
with
his
salary
and
your
earnings
you
might
even
attract
him
very
much
and
you
get
on
very
well
together
goodness
knows
what
you
are
saying
nikolay
nikolayitch
well
i
meant
no
harm
a
silence
followed
stytchkin
began
loudly
blowing
his
nose
while
the
matchmaker
turned
crimson
and
looking
bashfully
at
him
asked
and
how
much
do
you
get
nikolay
nikolayitch
i
roubles
besides
tips
apart
from
that
we
make
something
out
of
candles
and
hares
you
go
hunting
then
no
passengers
who
travel
without
tickets
are
called
hares
with
us
another
minute
passed
in
silence
stytchkin
got
up
and
walked
about
the
room
in
excitement
i
do
want
a
young
wife
said
he
i
am
a
man
and
i
want
someone
who
as
it
might
be
like
you
staid
and
settled
and
a
figure
something
like
yours
goodness
knows
what
you
are
saying
giggled
the
matchmaker
hiding
her
crimson
face
in
her
kerchief
there
is
no
need
to
be
long
thinking
about
it
you
are
after
my
own
heart
and
you
suit
me
in
your
qualities
i
am
a
practical
sober
man
and
if
you
like
me
what
could
be
better
allow
me
to
make
you
a
proposal
the
matchmaker
dropped
a
tear
laughed
and
in
token
of
her
consent
clinked
glasses
with
stytchkin
well
said
the
happy
railway
guard
now
allow
me
to
explain
to
you
the
behaviour
and
manner
of
life
i
desire
from
you
i
am
a
strict
respectable
practical
man
i
take
a
gentlemanly
view
of
everything
and
i
desire
that
my
wife
should
be
strict
also
and
should
understand
that
to
her
i
am
a
benefactor
and
the
foremost
person
in
the
world
he
sat
down
and
heaving
a
deep
sigh
began
expounding
to
his
his
views
on
domestic
life
and
a
wife
duties
the
new
year
eve
nellie
the
daughter
of
a
landowner
and
general
a
young
and
pretty
girl
dreaming
day
and
night
of
being
married
was
sitting
in
her
room
gazing
with
exhausted
eyes
into
the
she
was
pale
tense
and
as
motionless
as
the
the
but
apparent
vista
of
a
long
narrow
corridor
with
endless
rows
of
candles
the
reflection
of
her
face
her
hands
of
the
frame
all
this
was
already
clouded
in
mist
and
merged
into
a
boundless
grey
sea
the
sea
was
undulating
gleaming
and
now
and
then
flaring
crimson
looking
at
nellie
motionless
eyes
and
parted
lips
one
could
hardly
say
whether
she
was
asleep
or
awake
but
nevertheless
she
was
seeing
at
first
she
saw
only
the
smile
and
soft
charming
expression
of
someone
eyes
then
against
the
shifting
grey
background
there
gradually
appeared
the
outlines
of
a
head
a
face
eyebrows
beard
it
was
he
the
destined
one
the
object
of
long
dreams
and
hopes
the
destined
one
was
for
nellie
everything
the
significance
of
life
personal
happiness
career
fate
outside
him
as
on
the
grey
background
of
the
all
was
dark
empty
meaningless
and
so
it
was
not
strange
that
seeing
before
her
a
handsome
gently
smiling
face
she
was
conscious
of
bliss
of
an
unutterably
sweet
dream
that
could
not
be
expressed
in
speech
or
on
paper
then
she
heard
his
voice
saw
herself
living
under
the
same
roof
with
him
her
life
merged
into
his
months
and
years
flew
by
against
the
grey
background
and
nellie
saw
her
future
distinctly
in
all
its
details
picture
followed
picture
against
the
grey
background
now
nellie
saw
herself
one
winter
night
knocking
at
the
door
of
stepan
lukitch
the
district
doctor
the
old
dog
hoarsely
and
lazily
barked
behind
the
gate
the
doctor
windows
were
in
darkness
all
was
silence
for
god
sake
for
god
sake
whispered
nellie
but
at
last
the
garden
gate
creaked
and
nellie
saw
the
cook
is
the
doctor
at
home
his
honour
asleep
whispered
the
cook
into
her
sleeve
as
though
afraid
of
waking
her
master
he
only
just
got
home
from
his
fever
patients
and
gave
orders
he
was
not
to
be
waked
but
nellie
scarcely
heard
the
cook
thrusting
her
aside
she
rushed
headlong
into
the
doctor
house
running
through
some
dark
and
stuffy
rooms
upsetting
two
or
three
chairs
she
at
last
reached
the
doctor
bedroom
stepan
lukitch
was
lying
on
his
bed
dressed
but
without
his
coat
and
with
pouting
lips
was
breathing
into
his
open
hand
a
little
glimmered
faintly
beside
him
without
uttering
a
word
nellie
sat
down
and
began
to
cry
she
wept
bitterly
shaking
all
over
my
husband
is
ill
she
sobbed
out
stepan
lukitch
was
silent
he
slowly
sat
up
propped
his
head
on
his
hand
and
looked
at
his
visitor
with
fixed
sleepy
eyes
my
husband
is
ill
nellie
continued
restraining
her
sobs
for
mercy
sake
come
quickly
make
haste
make
haste
eh
growled
the
doctor
blowing
into
his
hand
come
come
this
very
minute
or
it
terrible
to
think
for
mercy
sake
and
pale
exhausted
nellie
gasping
and
swallowing
her
tears
began
describing
to
the
doctor
her
husband
illness
her
unutterable
terror
her
sufferings
would
have
touched
the
heart
of
a
stone
but
the
doctor
looked
at
her
blew
into
his
open
hand
and
not
a
movement
i
come
he
muttered
that
impossible
cried
nellie
i
know
my
husband
has
typhus
at
once
this
very
minute
you
are
needed
i
er
have
only
just
come
in
muttered
the
doctor
for
the
last
three
days
i
been
away
seeing
typhus
patients
and
i
exhausted
and
ill
myself
i
simply
ca
absolutely
i
caught
it
myself
there
and
the
doctor
thrust
before
her
eyes
a
clinical
thermometer
my
temperature
is
nearly
forty
i
absolutely
ca
i
can
scarcely
sit
up
excuse
me

down
but
i
implore

nellie
moaned
in
despair
i
beseech
you

me
for
mercy
sake
make
a
great
effort
and
come
i
will
repay
you
doctor
oh
dear
why
i
have
told
you
already
ah
nellie
leapt
up
and
walked
nervously
up
and
down
the
bedroom
she
longed
to
explain
to
the
doctor
to
bring
him
to
reason
she
thought
if
only
he
knew
how
dear
her
husband
was
to
her
and
how
unhappy
she
was
he
would
forget
his
exhaustion
and
his
illness
but
how
could
she
be
eloquent
enough
go
to
the
zemstvo
doctor
she
heard
stepan
lukitch
voice
that
impossible
he
lives
more
than
twenty
miles
from
here
and
time
is
precious
and
the
horses
ca
stand
it
it
is
thirty
miles
from
us
to
you
and
as
much
from
here
to
the
zemstvo
doctor
no
it
impossible
come
along
stepan
lukitch
i
ask
of
you
an
heroic
deed
come

that
heroic
deed
have
pity
on
us
it
beyond
everything
i
in
a
fever
my
head
in
a
whirl
and
she
wo
understand
leave
me
alone
but
you
are
in
duty
bound
to
come
you
can
not
refuse
to
come
egoism
a
man
is
bound
to
sacrifice
his
life
for
his
neighbour
and
you
you
refuse
to
come
i
will
summon
you
before
the
court
nellie
felt
that
she
was
uttering
a
false
and
undeserved
insult
but
for
her
husband
sake
she
was
capable
of
forgetting
logic
tact
sympathy
for
others
in
reply
to
her
threats
the
doctor
greedily
gulped
a
glass
of
cold
water
nellie
fell
to
entreating
and
imploring
like
the
very
lowest
beggar
at
last
the
doctor
gave
way
he
slowly
got
up
puffing
and
panting
looking
for
his
coat
here
it
is
cried
nellie
helping
him
let
me
put
it
on
to
you
come
along
i
will
repay
you
all
my
life
i
shall
be
grateful
to
you
but
what
agony
after
putting
on
his
coat
the
doctor
lay
down
again
nellie
got
him
up
and
dragged
him
to
the
hall
then
there
was
an
agonizing
over
his
goloshes
his
overcoat
his
cap
was
lost
but
at
last
nellie
was
in
the
carriage
with
the
doctor
now
they
had
only
to
drive
thirty
miles
and
her
husband
would
have
a
doctor
help
the
earth
was
wrapped
in
darkness
one
could
not
see
one
hand
before
one
face
a
cold
winter
wind
was
blowing
there
were
frozen
lumps
under
their
wheels
the
coachman
was
continually
stopping
and
wondering
which
road
to
take
nellie
and
the
doctor
sat
silent
all
the
way
it
was
fearfully
jolting
but
they
felt
neither
the
cold
nor
the
jolts
get
on
get
on
nellie
implored
the
driver
at
five
in
the
morning
the
exhausted
horses
drove
into
the
yard
nellie
saw
the
familiar
gates
the
well
with
the
crane
the
long
row
of
stables
and
barns
at
last
she
was
at
home
wait
a
moment
i
will
be
back
directly
she
said
to
stepan
lukitch
making
him
sit
down
on
the
sofa
in
the
sit
still
and
wait
a
little
and
i
see
how
he
is
going
on
on
her
return
from
her
husband
nellie
found
the
doctor
lying
down
he
was
lying
on
the
sofa
and
muttering
doctor
please
doctor
eh
ask
domna
muttered
stepan
lukitch
what
they
said
at
the
meeting
vlassov
said
who
what
and
to
her
horror
nellie
saw
that
the
doctor
was
as
delirious
as
her
husband
what
was
to
be
done
i
must
go
for
the
zemstvo
doctor
she
decided
then
again
there
followed
darkness
a
cutting
cold
wind
lumps
of
frozen
earth
she
was
suffering
in
body
and
in
soul
and
delusive
nature
has
no
arts
no
deceptions
to
compensate
these
sufferings
then
she
saw
against
the
grey
background
how
her
husband
every
spring
was
in
straits
for
money
to
pay
the
interest
for
the
mortgage
to
the
bank
he
could
not
sleep
she
could
not
sleep
and
both
racked
their
brains
till
their
heads
ached
thinking
how
to
avoid
being
visited
by
the
clerk
of
the
court
she
saw
her
children
the
everlasting
apprehension
of
colds
scarlet
fever
diphtheria
bad
marks
at
school
separation
out
of
a
brood
of
five
or
six
one
was
sure
to
die
the
grey
background
was
not
untouched
by
death
that
might
well
be
a
husband
and
wife
can
not
die
simultaneously
whatever
happened
one
must
bury
the
other
and
nellie
saw
her
husband
dying
this
terrible
event
presented
itself
to
her
in
every
detail
she
saw
the
coffin
the
candles
the
deacon
and
even
the
footmarks
in
the
hall
made
by
the
undertaker
why
is
it
what
is
it
for
she
asked
looking
blankly
at
her
husband
face
and
all
the
previous
life
with
her
husband
seemed
to
her
a
stupid
prelude
to
this
something
fell
from
nellie
hand
and
knocked
on
the
floor
she
started
jumped
up
and
opened
her
eyes
wide
one
she
saw
lying
at
her
feet
the
other
was
standing
as
before
on
the
table
she
looked
into
the
and
saw
a
pale
face
there
was
no
grey
background
now
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
she
thought
with
a
sigh
of
relief
old
age
uzelkov
an
architect
with
the
rank
of
civil
councillor
arrived
in
his
native
town
to
which
he
had
been
invited
to
restore
the
church
in
the
cemetery

had
been
born
in
the
town

been
at

had
grown
up
and
married

it
but
when
he
got
out
of

he
scarcely
recognized
it
everything
was
changed
eighteen
years
ago
when
he
had
moved
to
petersburg

used
to
catch
marmots
for
instance
on
the
spot
where
now
the
station
was
standing
now
when
one
drove
into
the
chief
street
a
hotel
of
four
storeys
stood
facing
one
in
old
days
there
was
an
ugly
grey
fence
just
there
but
nothing
neither
fences
nor
houses
had
changed
as
much
as
the
people
from
his
enquiries
of
the
hotel
waiter
uzelkov
learned
that
more
than
half
of
the
people
he
remembered
were
dead
reduced
to
poverty
forgotten
and
do
you
remember
uzelkov
he
asked
the
old
waiter
about
himself
uzelkov
the
architect
who
divorced
his
wife
he
used
to
have
a
house
in
svirebeyevsky
street

his
daughter
was
married
the
other
day
uzelkov
paced
up
and
down
the
room
thought
a
bit
and
in
his
boredom
made
up
his
mind
to
go
and
see
shapkin
at
his
office
when
he
walked
out
of
the
hotel
and
sauntered
slowly
towards
kirpitchny
street
it
was
midday
he
found
shapkin
at
his
office
and
scarcely
recognized
him
from
the
once
adroit
attorney
with
a
mobile
insolent
and
always
drunken
face
shapkin
had
changed
into
a
modest
decrepit
old
man
you
do
recognize
me
you
have
forgotten
me
began
uzelkov
i
am
your
old
client
uzelkov
uzelkov
what
uzelkov
ah
shapkin
remembered
recognized
and
was
struck
all
of
a
heap
there
followed
a
shower
of
exclamations
questions
recollections
this
is
a
surprise
this
is
unexpected
cackled
shapkin
what
can
i
offer
you
do
you
care
for
champagne
perhaps
you
would
like
oysters
my
dear
fellow
i
have
had
so
much
from
you
in
my
time
that
i
ca
offer
you
anything
equal
to
the
occasion
please
do
put
yourself
out
said
uzelkov
i
have
no
time
to
spare
i
must
go
at
once
to
the
cemetery
and
examine
the
church
i
have
undertaken
the
restoration
of
it
that
capital
we
have
a
snack
and
a
drink
and
drive
together
i
have
capital
horses
i
take
you
there
and
introduce
you
to
the
i
will
arrange
it
all
but
why
is
it
my
angel
you
seem
to
be
afraid
of
me
and
hold
me
at
arm
length
sit
a
little
nearer
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
be
afraid
of
me
nowadays
at
one
time
it
is
true
i
was
a
cunning
blade
a
dog
of
a
fellow
no
one
dared
approach
me
but
now
i
am
stiller
than
water
and
humbler
than
the
grass
i
have
grown
old
i
am
a
family
man
i
have
children
it
time
i
was
dead
the
friends
had
lunch
had
a
drink
and
with
a
pair
of
horses
drove
out
of
the
town
to
the
cemetery
yes
those
were
times
shapkin
recalled
as
he
sat
in
the
sledge
when
you
remember
them
you
simply
ca
believe
in
them
do
you
remember
how
you
divorced
your
wife
it
nearly
twenty
years
ago
and
i
dare
say
you
have
forgotten
it
all
but
i
remember
it
as
though
i
divorced
you
yesterday
good
lord
what
a
lot
of
worry
i
had
over
it
i
was
a
sharp
fellow
tricky
and
cunning
a
desperate
character
sometimes
i
was
burning
to
tackle
some
ticklish
business
especially
if
the
fee
were
a
good
one
as
for
instance
in
your
case
what
did
you
pay
me
then
five
or
six
thousand
that
was
worth
taking
trouble
for
was
it
you
went
off
to
petersburg
and
left
the
whole
thing
in
my
hands
to
do
the
best
i
could
and
though
sofya
mihailovna
your
wife
came
only
of
a
merchant
family
she
was
proud
and
dignified
to
bribe
her
to
take
the
guilt
on
herself
was
difficult
awfully
difficult
i
would
go
to
negotiate
with
her
and
as
soon
as
she
saw
me
she
called
to
her
maid
did
i
tell
you
not
to
admit
that
scoundrel
well
i
tried
one
thing
and
another
i
wrote
her
letters
and
contrived
to
meet
her
accidentally
it
was
no
use
i
had
to
act
through
a
third
person
i
had
a
lot
of
trouble
with
her
for
a
long
time
and
she
only
gave
in
when
you
agreed
to
give
her
ten
thousand
she
could
resist
ten
thousand
she
could
hold
out
she
cried
she
spat
in
my
face
but
she
consented
she
took
the
guilt
on
herself
i
thought
it
was
fifteen
thousand
she
had
from
me
not
ten
said
uzelkov
yes
yes
fifteen
i
made
a
mistake
said
shapkin
in
confusion
it
all
over
and
done
with
though
it
no
use
concealing
it
i
gave
her
ten
and
the
other
five
i
collared
for
myself
i
deceived
you
both
it
all
over
and
done
with
it
no
use
to
be
ashamed
and
indeed
judge
for
yourself
boris
petrovitch
were
you
the
very
person
for
me
to
get
money
out
of
you
were
a
wealthy
man
and
had
everything
you
wanted
your
marriage
was
an
idle
whim
and
so
was
your
divorce
you
were
making
a
lot
of
money
i
remember
you
made
a
scoop
of
twenty
thousand
over
one
contract
whom
should
i
have
fleeced
if
not
you
and
i
must
own
i
envied
you
if
you
grabbed
anything
they
took
off
their
caps
to
you
while
they
would
thrash
me
for
a
rouble
and
slap
me
in
the
face
at
the
club
but
there
why
recall
it
it
is
high
time
to
forget
it
tell
me
please
how
did
sofya
mihailovna
get
on
afterwards
with
her
ten
thousand
very
badly
god
knows
what
it
was
she
lost
her
head
perhaps
or
maybe
her
pride
and
her
conscience
tormented
her
at
having
sold
her
honour
or
perhaps
she
loved
you
but
do
you
know
she
took
to
drink
as
soon
as
she
got
her
money
she
was
off
driving
about
with
officers
it
was
drunkenness
dissipation
debauchery
when
she
went
to
a
restaurant
with
officers
she
was
not
content
with
port
or
anything
light
she
must
have
strong
brandy
fiery
stuff
to
stupefy
her
yes
she
was
eccentric
i
had
a
lot
to
put
up
with
from
her
sometimes
she
would
take
offence
at
something
and
begin
being
hysterical
and
what
happened
afterwards
one
week
passed
and
then
another
i
was
sitting
at
home
writing
something
all
at
once
the
door
opened
and
she
walked
in
drunk
back
your
cursed
money
she
said
and
flung
a
roll
of
notes
in
my
face
so
she
could
not
keep
it
up
i
picked
up
the
notes
and
counted
them
it
was
five
hundred
short
of
the
ten
thousand
so
she
had
only
managed
to
get
through
five
hundred
where
did
you
put
the
money
it
all
ancient
history
there
no
reason
to
conceal
it
now
in
my
pocket
of
course
why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
wait
a
bit
for
what
will
come
later
it
a
regular
novel
a
pathological
study
a
couple
of
months
later
i
was
going
home
one
night
in
a
nasty
drunken
condition
i
lighted
a
candle
and
lo
and
behold
sofya
mihailovna
was
sitting
on
my
sofa
and
she
was
drunk
too
and
in
a
frantic
state
as
wild
as
though
she
had
run
out
of
bedlam
me
back
my
money
she
said
have
changed
my
mind
if
i
must
go
to
ruin
i
wo
do
it
by
halves
i
have
my
fling
be
quick
you
scoundrel
give
me
my
money
a
disgraceful
scene
and
you
gave
it
her
i
gave
her
i
remember
ten
roubles
oh
how
could
you
cried
uzelkov
frowning
if
you
could
or
would
have
given
it
her
you
might
have
written
to
me
and
i
did
know
i
did
know
my
dear
fellow
what
use
would
it
have
been
for
me
to
write
considering
that
she
wrote
to
you
herself
when
she
was
lying
in
the
hospital
afterwards
yes
but
i
was
so
taken
up
then
with
my
second
marriage
i
was
in
such
a
whirl
that
i
had
no
thoughts
to
spare
for
letters
but
you
were
an
outsider
you
had
no
antipathy
for
sofya
why
you
give
her
a
helping
hand
you
ca
judge
by
the
standards
of
boris
petrovitch
that
how
we
look
at
it
now
but
at
the
time
we
thought
very
differently
now
maybe
i
give
her
a
thousand
roubles
but
then
even
that
note
i
did
not
give
her
for
nothing
it
was
a
bad
business
we
must
forget
it
but
here
we
are
the
sledge
stopped
at
the
cemetery
gates
uzelkov
and
shapkin
got
out
of
the
sledge
went
in
at
the
gate
and
walked
up
a
long
broad
avenue
the
bare
and
acacias
the
grey
crosses
and
tombstones
were
silvered
with
every
little
grain
of
snow
reflected
the
bright
sunny
day
there
was
the
smell
there
always
is
in
cemeteries
the
smell
of
incense
and
freshly
dug
earth
our
cemetery
is
a
pretty
one
said
uzelkov
quite
a
garden
yes
but
it
is
a
pity
thieves
steal
the
tombstones
and
over
there
beyond
that
iron
monument
on
the
right
sofya
mihailovna
is
buried
would
you
like
to
see
the
friends
turned
to
the
right
and
walked
through
the
deep
snow
to
the
iron
monument
here
it
is
said
shapkin
pointing
to
a
little
slab
of
white
marble
a
lieutenant
put
the
stone
on
her
grave
uzelkov
slowly
took
off
his
cap
and
exposed
his
bald
head
to
the
sun
shapkin
looking
at
him
took
off
his
cap
too
and
another
bald
patch
gleamed
in
the
sunlight
there
was
the
stillness
of
the
tomb
all
around
as
though
the
air
too
were
dead
the
friends
looked
at
the
grave
pondered
and
said
nothing
she
sleeps
in
peace
said
shapkin
breaking
the
silence
nothing
to
her
now
that
she
took
the
blame
on
herself
and
drank
brandy
you
must
own
boris
petrovitch
own
what
uzelkov
asked
gloomily
why
however
hateful
the
past
it
was
better
than
this
and
shapkin
pointed
to
his
grey
head
i
used
not
to
think
of
the
hour
of
death
i
fancied
i
could
have
given
death
points
and
won
the
game
if
we
had
had
an
encounter
but
now
but
what
the
good
of
talking
uzelkov
was
overcome
with
melancholy
he
suddenly
had
a
passionate
longing
to
weep
as
once
he
had
longed
for
love
and
he
felt
those
tears
would
have
tasted
sweet
and
refreshing
a
moisture
came
into
his
eyes
and
there
was
a
lump
in
his
throat
but
shapkin
was
standing
beside
him
and
uzelkov
was
ashamed
to
show
weakness
before
a
witness
he
turned
back
abruptly
and
went
into
the
church
only
two
hours
later
after
talking
to
the
churchwarden
and
looking
over
the
church
he
seized
a
moment
when
shapkin
was
in
conversation
with
the
priest
and
hastened
away
to
weep
he
stole
up
to
the
grave
secretly
furtively
looking
round
him
every
minute
the
little
white
slab
looked
at
him
pensively
mournfully
and
innocently
as
though
a
little
girl
lay
under
it
instead
of
a
dissolute
divorced
wife
to
weep
to
weep
thought
uzelkov
but
the
moment
for
tears
had
been
missed
though
the
old
man
blinked
his
eyes
though
he
worked
up
his
feelings
the
tears
did
not
flow
nor
the
lump
come
in
his
throat
after
standing
for
ten
minutes
with
a
gesture
of
despair
uzelkov
went
to
look
for
shapkin
darkness
a
young
peasant
with
white
eyebrows
and
eyelashes
and
broad
cheekbones
in
a
torn
sheepskin
and
big
black
felt
overboots
waited
till
the
zemstvo
doctor
had
finished
seeing
his
patients
and
came
out
to
go
home
from
the
hospital
then
he
went
up
to
him
diffidently
please
your
honour
he
said
what
do
you
want
the
young
man
passed
the
palm
of
his
hand
up
and
over
his
nose
looked
at
the
sky
and
then
answered
please
your
honour
you
got
my
brother
vaska
the
blacksmith
from
varvarino
in
the
convict
ward
here
your
honour
yes

three
sisters
and

a
married
man
with
a
little
one
there
are
a
lot
of
us
and
no
one
to

the
smithy

nearly
two
years
now
since
the
forge

been
heated

the
cotton
factory

ca
lift
the
spoon
to
his
mouth
what
do
you
want
from
me
be
merciful
let
vaska
go
the
doctor
looked
wonderingly
at
kirila
and
without
saying
a
word
walked
on
the
young
peasant
ran
on
in
front
and
flung
himself
in
a
heap
at
his
feet
doctor
kind
gentleman
he
besought
him
blinking
and
again
passing
his
open
hand
over
his
nose
show
heavenly
mercy
let
vaska
go
home
we
shall
remember
you
in
our
prayers
for

they

all
starving
mother
wailing

in

out
vaska

wailing

worse
than
death
i
care
to
look
upon
the
light
of
day
be
merciful
let
him
go
kind
gentleman
are
you
stupid
or
out
of
your
senses
asked
the
doctor
angrily
how
can
i
let
him
go
why
he
is
a
convict
kirila
began
crying
let
him
go
tfoo
queer
fellow
what
right
have
i
am
i
a
gaoler
or
what
they
brought
him
to
the
hospital
for
me
to
treat
him
but
i
have
as
much
right
to
let
him
out
as
i
have
to
put
you
in
prison
silly
fellow
but
they
have
shut
him
up
for
nothing
he
was
in
prison
a
year
before
the
trial
and
now
there
is
no
saying
what
he
is
there
for
it
would
have
been
a
different
thing
if
he
had
murdered
someone
let
us
say
or
stolen
horses
but
as
it
is
what
is
it
all
about
very
likely
but
how
do
i
come
in
they
shut
a
man
up
and
they
do
know
themselves
what
for
he
was
drunk
your
honour
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing
and
even
hit
father
on
the
ear
and
scratched
his
own
cheek
on
a
branch
and
two
of
our
fellows
they
wanted
some
turkish
tobacco
you
telling
him
to
go
with
them
and
break
into
the
armenian
shop
at
night
for
tobacco
being
drunk
he
obeyed
them
the
fool
they
broke
the
lock
you
know
got
in
and
did
no
end
of
mischief
they
turned
everything
upside
down
broke
the
windows
and
scattered
the
flour
about
they
were
drunk
that
is
all
one
can
say
well
the
constable
turned
up
and
with
one
thing
and
another
they
took
them
off
to
the
magistrate
they
have
been
a
whole
year
in
prison
and
a
week
ago
on
the
wednesday
they
were
all
three
tried
in
the
town
a
soldier
stood
behind
them
with
a
gun
people
were
sworn
in
vaska
was
less
to
blame
than
any
but
the
gentry
decided
that
he
was
the
ringleader
the
other
two
lads
were
sent
to
prison
but
vaska
to
a
convict
battalion
for
three
years
and
what
for
one
should
judge
like
a
christian
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
tell
you
again
go
to
the
authorities
i
have
been
already
i
been
to
the
court
i
have
tried
to
send
in
a
petition
they
would
take
a
petition
i
have
been
to
the
police
captain
and
i
have
been
to
the
examining
magistrate
and
everyone
says
is
not
my
business
whose
business
is
it
then
but
there
is
no
one
above
you
here
in
the
hospital
you
do
what
you
like
your
honour
you
simpleton
sighed
the
doctor
once
the
jury
have
found
him
guilty
not
the
governor
not
even
the
minister
could
do
anything
let
alone
the
police
captain
it
no
good
your
trying
to
do
anything
and
who
judged
him
then
the
gentlemen
of
the
jury
they
were
gentlemen
they
were
our
peasants
andrey
guryev
was
one
aloshka
huk
was
one
well
i
am
cold
talking
to
you
the
doctor
waved
his
hand
and
walked
quickly
to
his
own
door
kirila
was
on
the
point
of
following
him
but
seeing
the
door
slam
he
stopped
for
ten
minutes
he
stood
motionless
in
the
middle
of
the
hospital
yard
and
without
putting
on
his
cap
stared
at
the
doctor
house
then
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
slowly
scratched
himself
and
walked
towards
the
gate
to
whom
am
i
to
go
he
muttered
as
he
came
out
on
to
the
road
one
says
it
is
not
his
business
another
says
it
is
not
his
business
whose
business
is
it
then
no
till
you
grease
their
hands
you
will
get
nothing
out
of
them
the
doctor
says
that
but
he
keeps
looking
all
the
while
at
my
fist
to
see
whether
i
am
going
to
give
him
a
blue
note
well
brother
i
go
if
it
has
to
be
to
the
governor
shifting
from
one
foot
to
the
other
and
continually
looking
round
him
in
an
objectless
way
he
trudged
lazily
along
the
road
and
was
apparently
wondering
where
to
go
it
was
not
cold
and
the
snow
faintly
crunched
under
his
feet
not
more
than
half
a
mile
in
front
of
him
the
wretched
little
district
town
in
which
his
brother
had
just
been
tried
lay
outstretched
on
the
hill
on
the
right
was
the
dark
prison
with
its
red
roof
and
at
the
corners
on
the
left
was
the
big
town
copse
now
covered
with
it
was
still
only
an
old
man
wearing
a
woman
short
jacket
and
a
huge
cap
was
walking
ahead
coughing
and
shouting
to
a
cow
which
he
was
driving
to
the
town
grandfather
said
kirila
overtaking
him
are
you
driving
it
to
the
market
no
the
old
man
answered
lazily
are
you
a
townsman
they
got
into
conversation
kirila
told
him
what
he
had
come
to
the
hospital
for
and
what
he
had
been
talking
about
to
the
doctor
the
doctor
does
not
know
anything
about
such
matters
that
is
a
sure
thing
the
old
man
said
to
him
as
they
were
both
entering
the
town
though
he
is
a
gentleman
he
is
only
taught
to
cure
by
every
means
but
to
give
you
real
advice
or
let
us
say
write
out
a
petition
for
you
that
he
can
not
do
there
are
special
authorities
to
do
that
you
have
been
to
the
justice
of
the
peace
and
to
the
police
captain
they
are
no
good
for
your
business
either
where
am
i
to
go
the
permanent
member
of
the
rural
board
is
the
chief
person
for
peasants
affairs
go
to
him
mr
sineokov
the
one
who
is
at
zolotovo
why
yes
at
zolotovo
he
is
your
chief
man
if
it
is
anything
that
has
to
do
with
you
peasants
even
the
police
captain
has
no
authority
against
him
it
a
long
way
to
go
old
man
i
dare
say
it
twelve
miles
and
may
be
more
one
who
needs
something
will
go
seventy
that
is
so
should
i
send
in
a
petition
to
him
or
what
you
will
find
out
there
if
you
should
have
a
petition
the
clerk
will
write
you
one
quick
enough
the
permanent
member
has
a
clerk
after
parting
from
the
old
man
kirila
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
square
thought
a
little
and
walked
back
out
of
the
town
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
zolotovo
five
days
later
as
the
doctor
was
on
his
way
home
after
seeing
his
patients
he
caught
sight
of
kirila
again
in
his
yard
this
time
the
young
peasant
was
not
alone
but
with
a
gaunt
very
pale
old
man
who
nodded
his
head
without
ceasing
like
a
pendulum
and
mumbled
with
his
lips
your
honour
i
have
come
again
to
ask
your
gracious
mercy
began
kirila
here
i
have
come
with
my
father
be
merciful
let
vaska
go
the
permanent
member
would
not
talk
to
me
he
said
away
your
honour
the
old
man
hissed
in
his
throat
raising
his
twitching
eyebrows
be
merciful
we
are
poor
people
we
can
not
repay
your
honour
but
if
you
graciously
please
kiryushka
or
vaska
can
repay
you
in
work
let
them
work
we
will
pay
with
work
said
kirila
and
he
raised
his
hand
above
his
head
as
though
he
would
take
an
oath
let
him
go
they
are
starving
they
are
crying
day
and
night
your
honour
the
young
peasant
bent
a
rapid
glance
on
his
father
pulled
him
by
the
sleeve
and
both
of
them
as
at
the
word
of
command
fell
at
the
doctor
feet
the
latter
waved
his
hand
in
despair
and
without
looking
round
walked
quickly
in
at
his
door
the
beggar
kind
sir
be
so
good
as
to
notice
a
poor
hungry
man
i
have
not
tasted
food
for
three
days
i
have
not
a
piece
for
a
night
lodging
i
swear
by
god
for
five
years
i
was
a
village
schoolmaster
and
lost
my
post
through
the
intrigues
of
the
zemstvo
i
was
the
victim
of
false
witness
i
have
been
out
of
a
place
for
a
year
now
skvortsov
a
petersburg
lawyer
looked
at
the
speaker
tattered
dark
blue
overcoat
at
his
muddy
drunken
eyes
at
the
red
patches
on
his
cheeks
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
seen
the
man
before
and
now
i
am
offered
a
post
in
the
kaluga
province
the
beggar
continued
but
i
have
not
the
means
for
the
journey
there
graciously
help
me
i
am
ashamed
to
ask
but
i
am
compelled
by
circumstances
skvortsov
looked
at
his
goloshes
of
which
one
was
shallow
like
a
shoe
while
the
other
came
high
up
the
leg
like
a
boot
and
suddenly
remembered
listen
the
day
before
yesterday
i
met
you
in
sadovoy
street
he
said
and
then
you
told
me
not
that
you
were
a
village
schoolmaster
but
that
you
were
a
student
who
had
been
expelled
do
you
remember
no
that
can
not
be
so
the
beggar
muttered
in
confusion
i
am
a
village
schoolmaster
and
if
you
wish
it
i
can
show
you
documents
to
prove
it
that
enough
lies
you
called
yourself
a
student
and
even
told
me
what
you
were
expelled
for
do
you
remember
skvortsov
flushed
and
with
a
look
of
disgust
on
his
face
turned
away
from
the
ragged
figure
it
contemptible
sir
he
cried
angrily
it
a
swindle
hand
you
over
to
the
police
damn
you
you
are
poor
and
hungry
but
that
does
not
give
you
the
right
to
lie
so
shamelessly
the
ragged
figure
took
hold
of
the
and
like
a
bird
in
a
snare
looked
round
the
hall
desperately
i
i
am
not
lying
he
muttered
i
can
show
documents
who
can
believe
you
skvortsov
went
on
still
indignant
to
exploit
the
sympathy
of
the
public
for
village
schoolmasters
and
students
it
so
low
so
mean
so
dirty
it
revolting
skvortsov
flew
into
a
rage
and
gave
the
beggar
a
merciless
scolding
the
ragged
fellow
insolent
lying
aroused
his
disgust
and
aversion
was
an
offence
against
what
he
skvortsov
loved
and
prized
in
himself
kindliness
a
feeling
heart
sympathy
for
the
unhappy
by
his
lying
by
his
treacherous
assault
upon
compassion
the
individual
had
as
it
were
defiled
the
charity
which
he
liked
to
give
to
the
poor
with
no
misgivings
in
his
heart
the
beggar
at
first
defended
himself
protested
with
oaths
then
he
sank
into
silence
and
hung
his
head
overcome
with
shame
sir
he
said
laying
his
hand
on
his
heart
i
really
was
lying
i
am
not
a
student
and
not
a
village
schoolmaster
all
mere
invention
i
used
to
be
in
the
russian
choir
and
i
was
turned
out
of
it
for
drunkenness
but
what
can
i
do
believe
me
in
name
i
ca
get
on
without
lying
when
i
tell
the
truth
no
one
will
give
me
anything
with
the
truth
one
may
die
of
hunger
and
freeze
without
a
night
lodging
what
you
say
is
true
i
understand
that
but
what
am
i
to
do
what
are
you
to
do
you
ask
what
are
you
to
do
cried
skvortsov
going
close
up
to
him
work
that
what
you
must
do
you
must
work
work
i
know
that
myself
but
where
can
i
get
work
nonsense
you
are
young
strong
and
healthy
and
could
always
find
work
if
you
wanted
to
but
you
know
you
are
lazy
pampered
drunken
you
reek
of
vodka
like
a
pothouse
you
have
become
false
and
corrupt
to
the
marrow
of
your
bones
and
fit
for
nothing
but
begging
and
lying
if
you
do
graciously
condescend
to
take
work
you
must
have
a
job
in
an
office
in
the
russian
choir
or
as
a
where
you
will
have
a
salary
and
have
nothing
to
do
but
how
would
you
like
to
undertake
manual
labour
i
be
bound
you
would
be
a
house
porter
or
a
factory
hand
you
are
too
genteel
for
that
what
things
you
say
really
said
the
beggar
and
he
gave
a
bitter
smile
how
can
i
get
manual
work
it
rather
late
for
me
to
be
a
shopman
for
in
trade
one
has
to
begin
from
a
boy
no
one
would
take
me
as
a
house
porter
because
i
am
not
of
that
class
and
i
could
not
get
work
in
a
factory
one
must
know
a
trade
and
i
know
nothing
nonsense
you
always
find
some
justification
would
you
like
to
chop
wood
i
would
not
refuse
to
but
the
regular
woodchoppers
are
out
of
work
now
oh
all
idlers
argue
like
that
as
soon
as
you
are
offered
anything
you
refuse
it
would
you
care
to
chop
wood
for
me
certainly
i
will
very
good
we
shall
see
excellent
we
see
skvortsov
in
nervous
haste
and
not
without
malignant
pleasure
rubbing
his
hands
summoned
his
cook
from
the
kitchen
here
olga
he
said
to
her
take
this
gentleman
to
the
shed
and
let
him
chop
some
wood
the
beggar
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
though
puzzled
and
irresolutely
followed
the
cook
it
was
evident
from
his
demeanour
that
he
had
consented
to
go
and
chop
wood
not
because
he
was
hungry
and
wanted
to
earn
money
but
simply
from
shame
and
because
he
had
been
taken
at
his
word
it
was
clear
too
that
he
was
suffering
from
the
effects
of
vodka
that
he
was
unwell
and
felt
not
the
faintest
inclination
to
work
skvortsov
hurried
into
the
there
from
the
window
which
looked
out
into
the
yard
he
could
see
the
woodshed
and
everything
that
happened
in
the
yard
standing
at
the
window
skvortsov
saw
the
cook
and
the
beggar
come
by
the
back
way
into
the
yard
and
go
through
the
muddy
snow
to
the
woodshed
olga
scrutinized
her
companion
angrily
and
jerking
her
elbow
unlocked
the
woodshed
and
angrily
banged
the
door
open
most
likely
we
interrupted
the
woman
drinking
her
coffee
thought
skvortsov
what
a
cross
creature
she
is
then
he
saw
the
and
seat
himself
on
a
block
of
wood
and
leaning
his
red
cheeks
upon
his
fists
sink
into
thought
the
cook
flung
an
axe
at
his
feet
spat
angrily
on
the
ground
and
judging
by
the
expression
of
her
lips
began
abusing
him
the
beggar
drew
a
log
of
wood
towards
him
irresolutely
set
it
up
between
his
feet
and
diffidently
drew
the
axe
across
it
the
log
toppled
and
fell
over
the
beggar
drew
it
towards
him
breathed
on
his
frozen
hands
and
again
drew
the
axe
along
it
as
cautiously
as
though
he
were
afraid
of
its
hitting
his
golosh
or
chopping
off
his
fingers
the
log
fell
over
again
skvortsov
wrath
had
passed
off
by
now
he
felt
sore
and
ashamed
at
the
thought
that
he
had
forced
a
pampered
drunken
and
perhaps
sick
man
to
do
hard
rough
work
in
the
cold
never
mind
let
him
go
on
he
thought
going
from
the
into
his
study
i
am
doing
it
for
his
good
an
hour
later
olga
appeared
and
announced
that
the
wood
had
been
chopped
up
here
give
him
half
a
rouble
said
skvortsov
if
he
likes
let
him
come
and
chop
wood
on
the
first
of
every
month
there
will
always
be
work
for
him
on
the
first
of
the
month
the
beggar
turned
up
and
again
earned
half
a
rouble
though
he
could
hardly
stand
from
that
time
forward
he
took
to
turning
up
frequently
and
work
was
always
found
for
him
sometimes
he
would
sweep
the
snow
into
heaps
or
clear
up
the
shed
at
another
he
used
to
beat
the
rugs
and
the
mattresses
he
always
received
thirty
to
forty
kopecks
for
his
work
and
on
one
occasion
an
old
pair
of
trousers
was
sent
out
to
him
when
he
moved
skvortsov
engaged
him
to
assist
in
packing
and
moving
the
furniture
on
this
occasion
the
beggar
was
sober
gloomy
and
silent
he
scarcely
touched
the
furniture
walked
with
hanging
head
behind
the
furniture
vans
and
did
not
even
try
to
appear
busy
he
merely
shivered
with
the
cold
and
was
overcome
with
confusion
when
the
men
with
the
vans
laughed
at
his
idleness
feebleness
and
ragged
coat
that
had
once
been
a
gentleman
after
the
removal
skvortsov
sent
for
him
well
i
see
my
words
have
had
an
effect
upon
you
he
said
giving
him
a
rouble
this
is
for
your
work
i
see
that
you
are
sober
and
not
disinclined
to
work
what
is
your
name
lushkov
i
can
offer
you
better
work
not
so
rough
lushkov
can
you
write
yes
sir
then
go
with
this
note
to
my
colleague
and
he
will
give
you
some
copying
to
do
work
do
drink
and
do
forget
what
i
said
to
you
skvortsov
pleased
that
he
had
put
a
man
in
the
path
of
rectitude
patted
lushkov
genially
on
the
shoulder
and
even
shook
hands
with
him
at
parting
lushkov
took
the
letter
departed
and
from
that
time
forward
did
not
come
to
the
for
work
two
years
passed
one
day
as
skvortsov
was
standing
at
the
of
a
theatre
paying
for
his
ticket
he
saw
beside
him
a
little
man
with
a
lambskin
collar
and
a
shabby
cap
the
man
timidly
asked
the
clerk
for
a
gallery
ticket
and
paid
for
it
with
kopecks
lushkov
is
it
you
asked
skvortsov
recognizing
in
the
little
man
his
former
woodchopper
well
what
are
you
doing
are
you
getting
on
all
right
pretty
well
i
am
in
a
notary
office
now
i
earn
roubles
well
thank
god
that
capital
i
rejoice
for
you
i
am
very
very
glad
lushkov
you
know
in
a
way
you
are
my
godson
it
was
i
who
shoved
you
into
the
right
way
do
you
remember
what
a
scolding
i
gave
you
eh
you
almost
sank
through
the
floor
that
time
well
thank
you
my
dear
fellow
for
remembering
my
words
thank
you
too
said
lushkov
if
i
had
not
come
to
you
that
day
maybe
i
should
be
calling
myself
a
schoolmaster
or
a
student
still
yes
in
your
house
i
was
saved
and
climbed
out
of
the
pit
i
am
very
very
glad
thank
you
for
your
kind
words
and
deeds
what
you
said
that
day
was
excellent
i
am
grateful
to
you
and
to
your
cook
god
bless
that
kind
woman
what
you
said
that
day
was
excellent
i
am
indebted
to
you
as
long
as
i
live
of
course
but
it
was
your
cook
olga
who
really
saved
me
how
was
that
why
it
was
like
this
i
used
to
come
to
you
to
chop
wood
and
she
would
begin
you
drunkard
you
man
and
yet
death
does
not
take
you
and
then
she
would
sit
opposite
me
lamenting
looking
into
my
face
and
wailing
unlucky
fellow
you
have
no
gladness
in
this
world
and
in
the
next
you
will
burn
in
hell
poor
drunkard
you
poor
sorrowful
creature
and
she
always
went
on
in
that
style
you
know
how
often
she
upset
herself
and
how
many
tears
she
shed
over
me
i
ca
tell
you
but
what
affected
me
most
she
chopped
the
wood
for
me
do
you
know
sir
i
never
chopped
a
single
log
for
you
she
did
it
all
how
it
was
she
saved
me
how
it
was
i
changed
looking
at
her
and
gave
up
drinking
i
explain
i
only
know
that
what
she
said
and
the
noble
way
she
behaved
brought
about
a
change
in
my
soul
and
i
shall
never
forget
it
it
time
to
go
up
though
they
are
just
going
to
ring
the
bell
lushkov
bowed
and
went
off
to
the
gallery
a
story
without
a
title
in
the
fifth
century
just
as
now
the
sun
rose
every
morning
and
every
evening
retired
to
rest
in
the
morning
when
the
first
rays
kissed
the
dew
the
earth
revived
the
air
was
filled
with
the
sounds
of
rapture
and
hope
while
in
the
evening
the
same
earth
subsided
into
silence
and
plunged
into
gloomy
darkness
one
day
was
like
another
one
night
like
another
from
time
to
time
a
raced
up
and
there
was
the
angry
rumble
of
thunder
or
a
negligent
star
fell
out
of
the
sky
or
a
pale
monk
ran
to
tell
the
brotherhood
that
not
far
from
the
monastery
he
had
seen
a
tiger
and
that
was
all
and
then
each
day
was
like
the
next
the
monks
worked
and
prayed
and
their
father
superior
played
on
the
organ
made
latin
verses
and
wrote
music
the
wonderful
old
man
possessed
an
extraordinary
gift
he
played
on
the
organ
with
such
art
that
even
the
oldest
monks
whose
hearing
had
grown
somewhat
dull
towards
the
end
of
their
lives
could
not
restrain
their
tears
when
the
sounds
of
the
organ
floated
from
his
cell
when
he
spoke
of
anything
even
of
the
most
ordinary
things
for
instance
of
the
trees
of
the
wild
beasts
or
of
the
sea
they
could
not
listen
to
him
without
a
smile
or
tears
and
it
seemed
that
the
same
chords
vibrated
in
his
soul
as
in
the
organ
if
he
were
moved
to
anger
or
abandoned
himself
to
intense
joy
or
began
speaking
of
something
terrible
or
grand
then
a
passionate
inspiration
took
possession
of
him
tears
came
into
his
flashing
eyes
his
face
flushed
and
his
voice
thundered
and
as
the
monks
listened
to
him
they
felt
that
their
souls
were
by
his
inspiration
at
such
marvellous
splendid
moments
his
power
over
them
was
boundless
and
if
he
had
bidden
his
elders
fling
themselves
into
the
sea
they
would
all
every
one
of
them
have
hastened
to
carry
out
his
wishes
his
music
his
voice
his
poetry
in
which
he
glorified
god
the
heavens
and
the
earth
were
a
continual
source
of
joy
to
the
monks
it
sometimes
happened
that
through
the
monotony
of
their
lives
they
grew
weary
of
the
trees
the
flowers
the
spring
the
autumn
their
ears
were
tired
of
the
sound
of
the
sea
and
the
song
of
the
birds
seemed
tedious
to
them
but
the
talents
of
their
father
superior
were
as
necessary
to
them
as
their
daily
bread
dozens
of
years
passed
by
and
every
day
was
like
every
other
day
every
night
was
like
every
other
night
except
the
birds
and
the
wild
beasts
not
one
soul
appeared
near
the
monastery
the
nearest
human
habitation
was
far
away
and
to
reach
it
from
the
monastery
or
to
reach
the
monastery
from
it
meant
a
journey
of
over
seventy
miles
across
the
desert
only
men
who
despised
life
who
had
renounced
it
and
who
came
to
the
monastery
as
to
the
grave
ventured
to
cross
the
desert
what
was
the
amazement
of
the
monks
therefore
when
one
night
there
knocked
at
their
gate
a
man
who
turned
out
to
be
from
the
town
and
the
most
ordinary
sinner
who
loved
life
before
saying
his
prayers
and
asking
for
the
father
superior
blessing
this
man
asked
for
wine
and
food
to
the
question
how
he
had
come
from
the
town
into
the
desert
he
answered
by
a
long
story
of
hunting
he
had
gone
out
hunting
had
drunk
too
much
and
lost
his
way
to
the
suggestion
that
he
should
enter
the
monastery
and
save
his
soul
he
replied
with
a
smile
i
am
not
a
fit
companion
for
you
when
he
had
eaten
and
drunk
he
looked
at
the
monks
who
were
serving
him
shook
his
head
reproachfully
and
said
you
do
do
anything
you
monks
you
are
good
for
nothing
but
eating
and
drinking
is
that
the
way
to
save
one
soul
only
think
while
you
sit
here
in
peace
eat
and
drink
and
dream
of
beatitude
your
neighbours
are
perishing
and
going
to
hell
you
should
see
what
is
going
on
in
the
town
some
are
dying
of
hunger
others
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
their
gold
sink
into
profligacy
and
perish
like
flies
stuck
in
honey
there
is
no
faith
no
truth
in
men
whose
task
is
it
to
save
them
whose
work
is
it
to
preach
to
them
it
is
not
for
me
drunk
from
morning
till
night
as
i
am
can
a
meek
spirit
a
loving
heart
and
faith
in
god
have
been
given
you
for
you
to
sit
here
within
four
walls
doing
nothing
the
townsman
drunken
words
were
insolent
and
unseemly
but
they
had
a
strange
effect
upon
the
father
superior
the
old
man
exchanged
glances
with
his
monks
turned
pale
and
said
my
brothers
he
speaks
the
truth
you
know
indeed
poor
people
in
their
weakness
and
lack
of
understanding
are
perishing
in
vice
and
infidelity
while
we
do
not
move
as
though
it
did
not
concern
us
why
should
i
not
go
and
remind
them
of
the
christ
whom
they
have
forgotten
the
townsman
words
had
carried
the
old
man
away
the
next
day
he
took
his
staff
said
farewell
to
the
brotherhood
and
set
off
for
the
town
and
the
monks
were
left
without
music
and
without
his
speeches
and
verses
they
spent
a
month
drearily
then
a
second
but
the
old
man
did
not
come
back
at
last
after
three
months
had
passed
the
familiar
tap
of
his
staff
was
heard
the
monks
flew
to
meet
him
and
showered
questions
upon
him
but
instead
of
being
delighted
to
see
them
he
wept
bitterly
and
did
not
utter
a
word
the
monks
noticed
that
he
looked
greatly
aged
and
had
grown
thinner
his
face
looked
exhausted
and
wore
an
expression
of
profound
sadness
and
when
he
wept
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
been
outraged
the
monks
fell
to
weeping
too
and
began
with
sympathy
asking
him
why
he
was
weeping
why
his
face
was
so
gloomy
but
he
locked
himself
in
his
cell
without
uttering
a
word
for
seven
days
he
sat
in
his
cell
eating
and
drinking
nothing
weeping
and
not
playing
on
his
organ
to
knocking
at
his
door
and
to
the
entreaties
of
the
monks
to
come
out
and
share
his
grief
with
them
he
replied
with
unbroken
silence
at
last
he
came
out
gathering
all
the
monks
around
him
with
a
face
and
with
an
expression
of
grief
and
indignation
he
began
telling
them
of
what
had
befallen
him
during
those
three
months
his
voice
was
calm
and
his
eyes
were
smiling
while
he
described
his
journey
from
the
monastery
to
the
town
on
the
road
he
told
them
the
birds
sang
to
him
the
brooks
gurgled
and
sweet
youthful
hopes
agitated
his
soul
he
marched
on
and
felt
like
a
soldier
going
to
battle
and
confident
of
victory
he
walked
on
dreaming
and
composed
poems
and
hymns
and
reached
the
end
of
his
journey
without
noticing
it
but
his
voice
quivered
his
eyes
flashed
and
he
was
full
of
wrath
when
he
came
to
speak
of
the
town
and
of
the
men
in
it
never
in
his
life
had
he
seen
or
even
dared
to
imagine
what
he
met
with
when
he
went
into
the
town
only
then
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
in
his
old
age
he
saw
and
understood
how
powerful
was
the
devil
how
fair
was
evil
and
how
weak
and
and
worthless
were
men
by
an
unhappy
chance
the
first
dwelling
he
entered
was
the
abode
of
vice
some
fifty
men
in
possession
of
much
money
were
eating
and
drinking
wine
beyond
measure
intoxicated
by
the
wine
they
sang
songs
and
boldly
uttered
terrible
revolting
words
such
as
a
man
could
not
bring
himself
to
pronounce
boundlessly
free
and
happy
they
feared
neither
god
nor
the
devil
nor
death
but
said
and
did
what
they
liked
and
went
whither
their
lust
led
them
and
the
wine
clear
as
amber
flecked
with
sparks
of
gold
must
have
been
irresistibly
sweet
and
fragrant
for
each
man
who
drank
it
smiled
blissfully
and
wanted
to
drink
more
to
the
smile
of
man
it
responded
with
a
smile
and
sparkled
joyfully
when
they
drank
it
as
though
it
knew
the
devilish
charm
it
kept
hidden
in
its
sweetness
the
old
man
growing
more
and
more
incensed
and
weeping
with
wrath
went
on
to
describe
what
he
had
seen
on
a
table
in
the
midst
of
the
revellers
he
said
stood
a
sinful
woman
it
was
hard
to
imagine
or
to
find
in
nature
anything
more
lovely
and
fascinating
this
reptile
young
longhaired
with
black
eyes
and
full
lips
shameless
and
insolent
showed
her
teeth
and
smiled
as
though
to
say
look
how
shameless
how
beautiful
i
am
silk
and
brocade
fell
in
lovely
folds
from
her
shoulders
but
her
beauty
would
not
hide
itself
under
her
clothes
but
eagerly
thrust
itself
through
the
folds
like
the
young
grass
through
the
ground
in
spring
the
shameless
woman
drank
wine
sang
songs
and
abandoned
herself
to
anyone
who
wanted
her
then
the
old
man
wrathfully
brandishing
his
arms
described
the
the
the
theatres
the
artists
studios
where
they
painted
naked
women
or
moulded
them
of
clay
he
spoke
with
inspiration
with
sonorous
beauty
as
though
he
were
playing
on
unseen
chords
while
the
monks
petrified
greedily
drank
in
his
words
and
gasped
with
rapture
after
describing
all
the
charms
of
the
devil
the
beauty
of
evil
and
the
fascinating
grace
of
the
dreadful
female
form
the
old
man
cursed
the
devil
turned
and
shut
himself
up
in
his
cell
when
he
came
out
of
his
cell
in
the
morning
there
was
not
a
monk
left
in
the
monastery
they
had
all
fled
to
the
town
in
trouble
pyotr
semyonitch
the
bank
manager
together
with
the
his
assistant
and
two
members
of
the
board
were
taken
in
the
night
to
prison
the
day
after
the
upheaval
the
merchant
avdeyev
who
was
one
of
the
committee
of
auditors
was
sitting
with
his
friends
in
the
shop
saying
so
it
is
god

seems
there
is
no
escaping
your
fate

are
eating
caviare
and

know
it
will
be
prison
beggary
or
maybe
death

may
happen
take
pyotr
semyonitch
for
instance
he
spoke
screwing
up
his
drunken
eyes
while
his
friends
went
on
drinking
eating
caviare
and
listening
having
described
the
disgrace
and
helplessness
of
pyotr
semyonitch
who
only
the
day
before
had
been
powerful
and
respected
by
all
avdeyev
went
on
with
a
sigh
the
tears
of
the
mouse
come
back
to
the
cat
serve
them
right
the
scoundrels
they
could
steal
the
rooks
so

them

danilitch

of
his
friends

shop

i
signed
them
as
though
i
understood

name

have
time

it
besides
i
ca

without
my
spectacles
after
discussing
the
failure
of
the
bank
and
the
fate
of
pyotr
semyonitch
avdeyev
and
his
friends
went
to
eat
pie
at
the
house
of
a
friend
whose
wife
was
celebrating
her
at
the
party
everyone
was
discussing
the
bank
failure
avdeyev
was
more
excited
than
anyone
and
declared
that
he
had
long
foreseen
the
crash
and
knew
two
years
before
that
things
were
not
quite
right
at
the
bank
while
they
were
eating
pie
he
described
a
dozen
illegal
operations
which
had
come
to
his
knowledge
if
you
knew
why
did
you
not
give
information
asked
an
officer
who
was
present
i
was
the
only
one
the
whole
town
knew
of
it
laughed
avdeyev
besides
i
have
the
time
to
hang
about
the
law
courts
damn
them
he
had
a
nap
after
the
pie
and
then
had
dinner
then
had
another
nap
then
went
to
the
evening
service
at
the
church
of
which
he
was
a
warden
after
the
service
he
went
back
to
the
party
and
played
preference
till
midnight
everything
seemed
satisfactory
but
when
avdeyev
hurried
home
after
midnight
the
cook
who
opened
the
door
to
him
looked
pale
and
was
trembling
so
violently
that
she
could
not
utter
a
word
his
wife
elizaveta
trofimovna
a
flabby
overfed
woman
with
her
grey
hair
hanging
loose
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
in
the
quivering
all
over
and
vacantly
rolling
her
eyes
as
though
she
were
drunk
her
elder
son
vassily
a
boy
pale
too
and
extremely
agitated
was
fussing
round
her
with
a
glass
of
water
what
the
matter
asked
avdeyev
and
looked
angrily
sideways
at
the
stove
his
family
was
constantly
being
upset
by
the
fumes
from
it
the
examining
magistrate
has
just
been
with
the
police
answered
vassily
they
made
a
search
avdeyev
looked
round
him
the
cupboards
the
chests
the
tables
everything
bore
traces
of
the
recent
search
for
a
minute
avdeyev
stood
motionless
as
though
petrified
unable
to
understand
then
his
whole
inside
quivered
and
seemed
to
grow
heavy
his
left
leg
went
numb
and
unable
to
endure
his
trembling
he
lay
down
flat
on
the
sofa
he
felt
his
inside
heaving
and
his
rebellious
left
leg
tapping
against
the
back
of
the
sofa
in
the
course
of
two
or
three
minutes
he
recalled
the
whole
of
his
past
but
could
not
remember
any
crime
deserving
of
the
attention
of
the
police
it
all
nonsense
he
said
getting
up
they
must
have
slandered
me
i
must
lodge
a
complaint
of
their
having
dared
to
do
such
a
thing
next
morning
after
a
sleepless
night
avdeyev
as
usual
went
to
his
shop
his
customers
brought
him
the
news
that
during
the
night
the
public
prosecutor
had
sent
the
deputy
manager
and
the
to
prison
as
well
this
news
did
not
disturb
avdeyev
he
was
convinced
that
he
had
been
slandered
and
that
if
he
were
to
lodge
a
complaint
the
examining
magistrate
would
get
into
trouble
for
the
search
of
the
night
before
between
nine
and
ten
he
hurried
to
the
town
hall
to
see
the
secretary
who
was
the
only
educated
man
in
the
town
council
vladimir
stepanitch
what
this
new
fashion
he
said
bending
down
to
the
secretary
ear
people
have
been
stealing
but
how
do
i
come
in
what
has
it
to
do
with
me
my
dear
fellow
he
whispered
there
has
been
a
search
at
my
house
last
night
upon
my
word
have
they
gone
crazy
why
touch
me
because
one
should
be
a
sheep
the
secretary
answered
calmly
before
you
sign
you
ought
to
look
look
at
what
but
if
i
were
to
look
at
those
accounts
for
a
thousand
years
i
could
not
make
head
or
tail
of
them
it
all
greek
to
me
i
am
no
they
used
to
bring
them
to
me
and
i
signed
them
excuse
me
apart
from
that
you
and
your
committee
are
seriously
compromised
you
borrowed
nineteen
thousand
from
the
bank
giving
no
security
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
cried
avdeyev
in
amazement
i
am
not
the
only
one
in
debt
to
the
bank
the
whole
town
owes
it
money
i
pay
the
interest
and
i
shall
repay
the
debt
what
next
and
besides
to
tell
the
honest
truth
it
was
i
myself
borrowed
the
money
pyotr
semyonitch
forced
it
upon
me
it
he
said
it
if
you
do
take
it
he
said
means
that
you
do
trust
us
and
fight
shy
of
us
you
take
it
he
said
build
your
father
a
mill
so
i
took
it
well
you
see
none
but
children
or
sheep
can
reason
like
that
in
any
case
you
need
not
be
anxious
you
ca
escape
trial
of
course
but
you
are
sure
to
be
acquitted
the
secretary
indifference
and
calm
tone
restored
composure
going
back
to
his
shop
and
finding
friends
there
he
again
began
drinking
eating
caviare
and
airing
his
views
he
almost
forgot
the
police
search
and
he
was
only
troubled
by
one
circumstance
which
he
could
not
help
noticing
his
left
leg
was
strangely
numb
and
his
stomach
for
some
reason
refused
to
do
its
work
that
evening
destiny
dealt
another
overwhelming
blow
at
avdeyev
at
an
extraordinary
meeting
of
the
town
council
all
members
who
were
on
the
staff
of
the
bank
avdeyev
among
them
were
asked
to
resign
on
the
ground
that
they
were
charged
with
a
criminal
offence
in
the
morning
he
received
a
request
to
give
up
immediately
his
duties
as
churchwarden
after
that
avdeyev
lost
count
of
the
blows
dealt
him
by
fate
and
strange
unprecedented
days
flitted
rapidly
by
one
after
another
and
every
day
brought
some
new
unexpected
surprise
among
other
things
the
examining
magistrate
sent
him
a
summons
and
he
returned
home
after
the
interview
insulted
and
red
in
the
face
he
gave
me
no
peace
pestering
me
to
tell
him
why
i
had
signed
i
signed
that
all
about
it
i
did
do
it
on
purpose
they
brought
the
papers
to
the
shop
and
i
signed
them
i
am
no
great
hand
at
reading
writing
young
men
with
unconcerned
faces
arrived
sealed
up
the
shop
and
made
an
inventory
of
all
the
furniture
of
the
house
suspecting
some
intrigue
behind
this
and
as
before
unconscious
of
any
wrongdoing
avdeyev
in
his
mortification
ran
from
one
government
office
to
another
lodging
complaints
he
spent
hours
together
in
composed
long
petitions
shed
tears
swore
to
his
complaints
the
public
prosecutor
and
the
examining
magistrate
made
the
indifferent
and
rational
reply
come
to
us
when
you
are
summoned
we
have
not
time
to
attend
to
you
now
while
others
answered
it
is
not
our
business
the
secretary
an
educated
man
who
avdeyev
thought
might
have
helped
him
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
it
your
own
fault
you
should
have
been
a
sheep
the
old
man
exerted
himself
to
the
utmost
but
his
left
leg
was
still
numb
and
his
digestion
was
getting
worse
and
worse
when
he
was
weary
of
doing
nothing
and
was
getting
poorer
and
poorer
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
his
father
mill
or
to
his
brother
and
begin
dealing
in
corn
his
family
went
to
his
father
and
he
was
left
alone
the
days
flitted
by
one
after
another
without
a
family
without
a
shop
and
without
money
the
former
churchwarden
an
honoured
and
respected
man
spent
whole
days
going
the
round
of
his
friends
shops
drinking
eating
and
listening
to
advice
in
the
mornings
and
in
the
evenings
to
while
away
the
time
he
went
to
church
looking
for
hours
together
at
the
ikons
he
did
not
pray
but
pondered
his
conscience
was
clear
and
he
ascribed
his
position
to
mistake
and
misunderstanding
to
his
mind
it
was
all
due
to
the
fact
that
the
officials
and
the
examining
magistrates
were
young
men
and
inexperienced
it
seemed
to
him
that
if
he
were
to
talk
it
over
in
detail
and
open
his
heart
to
some
elderly
judge
everything
would
go
right
again
he
did
not
understand
his
judges
and
he
fancied
they
did
not
understand
him
the
days
raced
by
and
at
last
after
protracted
harassing
delays
the
day
of
the
trial
came
avdeyev
borrowed
fifty
roubles
and
providing
himself
with
spirit
to
rub
on
his
leg
and
a
decoction
of
herbs
for
his
digestion
set
off
for
the
town
where
the
circuit
court
was
being
held
the
trial
lasted
for
ten
days
throughout
the
trial
avdeyev
sat
among
his
companions
in
misfortune
with
the
stolid
composure
and
dignity
befitting
a
respectable
and
innocent
man
who
is
suffering
for
no
fault
of
his
own
he
listened
and
did
not
understand
a
word
he
was
in
an
antagonistic
mood
he
was
angry
at
being
detained
so
long
in
the
court
at
being
unable
to
get
lenten
food
anywhere
at
his
defending
counsel
not
understanding
him
and
as
he
thought
saying
the
wrong
thing
he
thought
that
the
judges
did
not
understand
their
business
they
took
scarcely
any
notice
of
avdeyev
they
only
addressed
him
once
in
three
days
and
the
questions
they
put
to
him
were
of
such
a
character
that
avdeyev
raised
a
laugh
in
the
audience
each
time
he
answered
them
when
he
tried
to
speak
of
the
expenses
he
had
incurred
of
his
losses
and
of
his
meaning
to
claim
his
costs
from
the
court
his
counsel
turned
round
and
made
an
incomprehensible
grimace
the
public
laughed
and
the
judge
announced
sternly
that
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
the
last
words
that
he
was
allowed
to
say
were
not
what
his
counsel
had
instructed
him
to
say
but
something
quite
different
which
raised
a
laugh
again
during
the
terrible
hour
when
the
jury
were
consulting
in
their
room
he
sat
angrily
in
the
refreshment
bar
not
thinking
about
the
jury
at
all
he
did
not
understand
why
they
were
so
long
deliberating
when
everything
was
so
clear
and
what
they
wanted
of
him
getting
hungry
he
asked
the
waiter
to
give
him
some
cheap
lenten
dish
for
forty
kopecks
they
gave
him
some
cold
fish
and
carrots
he
ate
it
and
felt
at
once
as
though
the
fish
were
heaving
in
a
chilly
lump
in
his
stomach
it
was
followed
by
flatulence
heartburn
and
pain
afterwards
as
he
listened
to
the
foreman
of
the
jury
reading
out
the
questions
point
by
point
there
was
a
regular
revolution
taking
place
in
his
inside
his
whole
body
was
bathed
in
a
cold
sweat
his
left
leg
was
numb
he
did
not
follow
understood
nothing
and
suffered
unbearably
at
not
being
able
to
sit
or
lie
down
while
the
foreman
was
reading
at
last
when
he
and
his
companions
were
allowed
to
sit
down
the
public
prosecutor
got
up
and
said
something
unintelligible
and
all
at
once
as
though
they
had
sprung
out
of
the
earth
some
police
officers
appeared
on
the
scene
with
drawn
swords
and
surrounded
all
the
prisoners
avdeyev
was
told
to
get
up
and
go
now
he
understood
that
he
was
found
guilty
and
in
charge
of
the
police
but
he
was
not
frightened
nor
amazed
such
a
turmoil
was
going
on
in
his
stomach
that
he
could
not
think
about
his
guards
so
they
wo
let
us
go
back
to
the
hotel
he
asked
one
of
his
companions
but
i
have
three
roubles
and
an
untouched
quarter
of
a
pound
of
tea
in
my
room
there
he
spent
the
night
at
the
police
station
all
night
he
was
aware
of
a
loathing
for
fish
and
was
thinking
about
the
three
roubles
and
the
quarter
of
a
pound
of
tea
early
in
the
morning
when
the
sky
was
beginning
to
turn
blue
he
was
told
to
dress
and
set
off
two
soldiers
with
bayonets
took
him
to
prison
never
before
had
the
streets
of
the
town
seemed
to
him
so
long
and
endless
he
walked
not
on
the
pavement
but
in
the
middle
of
the
road
in
the
muddy
thawing
snow
his
inside
was
still
at
war
with
the
fish
his
left
leg
was
numb
he
had
forgotten
his
goloshes
either
in
the
court
or
in
the
police
station
and
his
feet
felt
frozen
five
days
later
all
the
prisoners
were
brought
before
the
court
again
to
hear
their
sentence
avdeyev
learnt
that
he
was
sentenced
to
exile
in
the
province
of
tobolsk
and
that
did
not
frighten
nor
amaze
him
either
he
fancied
for
some
reason
that
the
trial
was
not
yet
over
that
there
were
more
adjournments
to
come
and
that
the
final
decision
had
not
been
reached
yet
he
went
on
in
the
prison
expecting
this
final
decision
every
day
only
six
months
later
when
his
wife
and
his
son
vassily
came
to
say
to
him
and
when
in
the
wasted
wretchedly
dressed
old
woman
he
scarcely
recognized
his
once
fat
and
dignified
elizaveta
trofimovna
and
when
he
saw
his
son
wearing
a
short
shabby
and
cotton
trousers
instead
of
the
uniform
he
realized
that
his
fate
was
decided
and
that
whatever
new
decision
there
might
be
his
past
would
never
come
back
to
him
and
for
the
first
time
since
the
trial
and
his
imprisonment
the
angry
expression
left
his
face
and
he
wept
bitterly
frost
a
popular
fête
with
a
philanthropic
object
had
been
arranged
on
the
feast
of
epiphany
in
the
provincial
town
of
n
they
had
selected
a
broad
part
of
the
river
between
the
market
and
the
bishop
palace
fenced
it
round
with
a
rope
with
and
with
flags
and
provided
everything
necessary
for
skating
sledging
and
tobogganing
the
festivity
was
organized
on
the
grandest
scale
possible
the
notices
that
were
distributed
were
of
huge
size
and
promised
a
number
of
delights
skating
a
military
band
a
lottery
with
no
blank
tickets
an
electric
sun
and
so
on
but
the
whole
scheme
almost
came
to
nothing
owing
to
the
hard
frost
from
the
eve
of
epiphany
there
were
degrees
of
frost
with
a
strong
wind
it
was
proposed
to
put
off
the
fête
and
this
was
not
done
only
because
the
public
which
for
a
long
while
had
been
looking
forward
to
the
fête
impatiently
would
not
consent
to
any
postponement
only
think
what
do
you
expect
in
winter
but
a
frost
said
the
ladies
persuading
the
governor
who
tried
to
insist
that
the
fête
should
be
postponed
if
anyone
is
cold
he
can
go
and
warm
himself
the
trees
the
horses
the
men
beards
were
white
with
frost
it
even
seemed
that
the
air
itself
crackled
as
though
unable
to
endure
the
cold
but
in
spite
of
that
the
frozen
public
were
skating
immediately
after
the
blessing
of
the
waters
and
precisely
at
one
the
military
band
began
playing
between
three
and
four
in
the
afternoon
when
the
festivity
was
at
its
height
the
select
society
of
the
place
gathered
together
to
warm
themselves
in
the
governor
pavilion
which
had
been
put
up
on
the
the
old
governor
and
his
wife
the
bishop
the
president
of
the
local
court
the
head
master
of
the
high
school
and
many
others
were
there
the
ladies
were
sitting
in
armchairs
while
the
men
crowded
round
the
wide
glass
door
looking
at
the
skating
holy
saints
said
the
bishop
in
surprise
what
flourishes
they
execute
with
their
legs
upon
my
soul
many
a
singer
could
do
a
twirl
with
his
voice
as
those
do
with
their
legs
aie
he
kill
himself
that
smirnov
that
gruzdev
said
the
head
master
mentioning
the
names
of
the
schoolboys
who
flew
by
the
pavilion
bah
he
all
laughed
the
governor
look
gentlemen
our
mayor
is
coming
he
is
coming
this
way
that
a
nuisance
he
will
talk
our
heads
off
now
a
little
thin
old
man
wearing
a
big
cap
and
a
coat
hanging
open
came
from
the
opposite
bank
towards
the
pavilion
avoiding
the
skaters
this
was
the
mayor
of
the
town
a
merchant
eremeyev
by
name
a
millionaire
and
an
old
inhabitant
of
n
flinging
wide
his
arms
and
shrugging
at
the
cold
he
skipped
along
knocking
one
golosh
against
the
other
evidently
in
haste
to
get
out
of
the
wind
he
suddenly
bent
down
stole
up
to
some
lady
and
plucked
at
her
sleeve
from
behind
when
she
looked
round
he
skipped
away
and
probably
delighted
at
having
succeeded
in
frightening
her
went
off
into
a
loud
aged
laugh
lively
old
fellow
said
the
governor
it
a
wonder
he
not
skating
as
he
got
near
the
pavilion
the
mayor
fell
into
a
little
tripping
trot
waved
his
hands
and
taking
a
run
slid
along
the
ice
in
his
huge
golosh
boots
up
to
the
very
door
yegor
ivanitch
you
ought
to
get
yourself
some
skates
the
governor
greeted
him
that
just
what
i
am
thinking
he
answered
in
a
squeaky
somewhat
nasal
tenor
taking
off
his
cap
i
wish
you
good
health
your
excellency
your
holiness
long
life
to
all
the
other
gentlemen
and
ladies
here
a
frost
yes
it
is
a
frost
bother
it
it
deadly
winking
with
his
red
frozen
eyes
yegor
ivanitch
stamped
on
the
floor
with
his
golosh
boots
and
swung
his
arms
together
like
a
frozen
cabman
such
a
damnable
frost
worse
than
any
dog
he
went
on
talking
smiling
all
over
his
face
it
a
real
affliction
it
healthy
said
the
governor
frost
strengthens
a
man
and
makes
him
vigorous
though
it
may
be
healthy
it
would
be
better
without
it
at
all
said
the
mayor
wiping
his
beard
with
a
red
handkerchief
it
would
be
a
good
riddance
to
my
thinking
your
excellency
the
lord
sends
it
us
as
a
punishment
the
frost
i
mean
we
sin
in
the
summer
and
are
punished
in
the
winter
yes
yegor
ivanitch
looked
round
him
quickly
and
flung
up
his
hands
why
where
the
needful
to
warm
us
up
he
asked
looking
in
alarm
first
at
the
governor
and
then
at
the
bishop
your
excellency
your
holiness
i
be
bound
the
ladies
are
frozen
too
we
must
have
something
this
wo
do
everyone
began
gesticulating
and
declaring
that
they
had
not
come
to
the
skating
to
warm
themselves
but
the
mayor
heeding
no
one
opened
the
door
and
beckoned
to
someone
with
his
crooked
finger
a
workman
and
a
fireman
ran
up
to
him
here
run
off
to
savatin
he
muttered
and
tell
him
to
make
haste
and
send
here
what
do
you
call
it
what
it
to
be
tell
him
to
send
a
dozen
glasses
a
dozen
glasses
of
mulled
wine
the
very
hottest
or
punch
perhaps
there
was
laughter
in
the
pavilion
a
nice
thing
to
treat
us
to
never
mind
we
will
drink
it
muttered
the
mayor
a
dozen
glasses
then
and
some
benedictine
perhaps
and
tell
them
to
warm
two
bottles
of
red
wine
oh
and
what
for
the
ladies
well
you
tell
them
to
bring
cakes
nuts
sweets
of
some
sort
perhaps
there
run
along
look
sharp
the
mayor
was
silent
for
a
minute
and
then
began
again
abusing
the
frost
banging
his
arms
across
his
chest
and
thumping
with
his
golosh
boots
no
yegor
ivanitch
said
the
governor
persuasively
do
be
unfair
the
russian
frost
has
its
charms
i
was
reading
lately
that
many
of
the
good
qualities
of
the
russian
people
are
due
to
the
vast
expanse
of
their
land
and
to
the
climate
the
cruel
struggle
for
existence
that
perfectly
true
it
may
be
true
your
excellency
but
it
would
be
better
without
it
the
frost
did
drive
out
the
french
of
course
and
one
can
freeze
all
sorts
of
dishes
and
the
children
can
go
skating
that
all
true
for
the
man
who
is
well
fed
and
well
clothed
the
frost
is
only
a
pleasure
but
for
the
working
man
the
beggar
the
pilgrim
the
crazy
wanderer
it
the
greatest
evil
and
misfortune
it
misery
your
holiness
in
a
frost
like
this
poverty
is
twice
as
hard
and
the
thief
is
more
cunning
and
evildoers
more
violent
there
no
gainsaying
it
i
am
turned
seventy
i
a
fur
coat
now
and
at
home
i
have
a
stove
and
rums
and
punches
of
all
sorts
the
frost
means
nothing
to
me
now
i
take
no
notice
of
it
i
do
care
to
know
of
it
but
how
it
used
to
be
in
old
days
holy
mother
dreadful
to
recall
it
my
memory
is
failing
me
with
years
and
i
have
forgotten
everything
my
enemies
and
my
sins
and
troubles
of
all
sorts
i
forget
them
all
but
the
frost
ough
how
i
remember
it
when
my
mother
died
i
was
left
a
little
devil
this
high
a
homeless
orphan
no
kith
nor
kin
wretched
ragged
little
clothes
hungry
nowhere
to
sleep
in
fact
have
here
no
abiding
city
but
seek
the
one
to
come
in
those
days
i
used
to
lead
an
old
blind
woman
about
the
town
for
five
kopecks
a
day
the
frosts
were
cruel
wicked
one
would
go
out
with
the
old
woman
and
begin
suffering
torments
my
creator
first
of
all
you
would
be
shivering
as
in
a
fever
shrugging
and
dancing
about
then
your
ears
your
fingers
your
feet
would
begin
aching
they
would
ache
as
though
someone
were
squeezing
them
with
pincers
but
all
that
would
have
been
nothing
a
trivial
matter
of
no
great
consequence
the
trouble
was
when
your
whole
body
was
chilled
one
would
walk
for
three
blessed
hours
in
the
frost
your
holiness
and
lose
all
human
semblance
your
legs
are
drawn
up
there
is
a
weight
on
your
chest
your
stomach
is
pinched
above
all
there
is
a
pain
in
your
heart
that
is
worse
than
anything
your
heart
aches
beyond
all
endurance
and
there
is
a
wretchedness
all
over
your
body
as
though
you
were
leading
death
by
the
hand
instead
of
an
old
woman
you
are
numb
all
over
turned
to
stone
like
a
statue
you
go
on
and
feel
as
though
it
were
not
you
walking
but
someone
else
moving
your
legs
instead
of
you
when
your
soul
is
frozen
you
do
know
what
you
are
doing
you
are
ready
to
leave
the
old
woman
with
no
one
to
guide
her
or
to
pull
a
hot
roll
from
off
a
hawker
tray
or
to
fight
with
someone
and
when
you
come
to
your
night
lodging
into
the
warmth
after
the
frost
there
is
not
much
joy
in
that
either
you
lie
awake
till
midnight
crying
and
do
know
yourself
what
you
are
crying
for
we
must
walk
about
the
before
it
gets
dark
said
the
governor
wife
who
was
bored
with
listening
who
coming
with
me
the
governor
wife
went
out
and
the
whole
company
trooped
out
of
the
pavilion
after
her
only
the
governor
the
bishop
and
the
mayor
remained
queen
of
heaven
and
what
i
went
through
when
i
was
a
shopboy
in
a
yegor
ivanitch
went
on
flinging
up
his
arms
so
that
his
coat
fell
open
one
would
go
out
to
the
shop
almost
before
it
was
light
by
eight
i
was
completely
frozen
my
face
was
blue
my
fingers
were
stiff
so
that
i
could
not
fasten
my
buttons
nor
count
the
money
one
would
stand
in
the
cold
turn
numb
and
think
i
shall
have
to
stand
like
this
right
on
till
evening
by
my
stomach
was
pinched
and
my
heart
was
aching
yes
and
i
was
not
much
better
afterwards
when
i
had
a
shop
of
my
own
the
frost
was
intense
and
the
shop
was
like
a
with
draughts
blowing
in
all
directions
the
coat
i
had
on
was
pardon
me
mangy
as
thin
as
paper
threadbare
one
would
be
chilled
through
and
through
half
dazed
and
turn
as
cruel
as
the
frost
oneself
i
would
pull
one
by
the
ear
so
that
i
nearly
pulled
the
ear
off
i
would
smack
another
on
the
back
of
the
head
i
glare
at
a
customer
like
a
ruffian
a
wild
beast
and
be
ready
to
fleece
him
and
when
i
got
home
in
the
evening
and
ought
to
have
gone
to
bed
i
be
and
set
upon
my
family
throwing
it
in
their
teeth
that
they
were
living
upon
me
i
would
make
a
row
and
carry
on
so
that
half
a
dozen
policemen
have
managed
me
the
frost
makes
one
spiteful
and
drives
one
to
drink
yegor
ivanitch
clasped
his
hands
and
went
on
and
when
we
were
taking
fish
to
moscow
in
the
winter
holy
mother
and
spluttering
as
he
talked
he
began
describing
the
horrors
he
endured
with
his
shopmen
when
he
was
taking
fish
to
moscow
yes
sighed
the
governor
it
is
wonderful
what
a
man
can
endure
you
used
to
take
of
fish
to
moscow
yegor
ivanitch
while
i
in
my
time
was
at
the
war
i
remember
one
extraordinary
instance
and
the
governor
described
how
during
the
last
war
one
frosty
night
the
division
in
which
he
was
had
stood
in
the
snow
without
moving
for
thirteen
hours
in
a
piercing
wind
from
fear
of
being
observed
the
division
did
not
light
a
fire
nor
make
a
sound
or
a
movement
they
were
forbidden
to
smoke
reminiscences
followed
the
governor
and
the
mayor
grew
lively
and
and
interrupting
each
other
began
recalling
their
experiences
and
the
bishop
told
them
how
when
he
was
serving
in
siberia
he
had
travelled
in
a
sledge
drawn
by
dogs
how
one
day
being
drowsy
in
a
time
of
sharp
frost
he
had
fallen
out
of
the
sledge
and
been
nearly
frozen
when
the
tunguses
turned
back
and
found
him
he
was
barely
alive
then
as
by
common
agreement
the
old
men
suddenly
sank
into
silence
sat
side
by
side
and
mused
ech
whispered
the
mayor
you
think
it
would
be
time
to
forget
but
when
you
look
at
the
at
the
schoolboys
at
the
convicts
in
their
wretched
gowns
it
brings
it
all
back
why
only
take
those
musicians
who
are
playing
now
i
be
bound
there
is
a
pain
in
their
hearts
a
pinch
at
their
stomachs
and
their
trumpets
are
freezing
to
their
lips
they
play
and
think
mother
we
have
another
three
hours
to
sit
here
in
the
cold
the
old
men
sank
into
thought
they
thought
of
that
in
man
which
is
higher
than
good
birth
higher
than
rank
and
wealth
and
learning
of
that
which
brings
the
lowest
beggar
near
to
god
of
the
helplessness
of
man
of
his
sufferings
and
his
patience
meanwhile
the
air
was
turning
blue
the
door
opened
and
two
waiters
from
savatin
walked
in
carrying
trays
and
a
big
muffled
teapot
when
the
glasses
had
been
filled
and
there
was
a
strong
smell
of
cinnamon
and
clove
in
the
air
the
door
opened
again
and
there
came
into
the
pavilion
a
beardless
young
policeman
whose
nose
was
crimson
and
who
was
covered
all
over
with
frost
he
went
up
to
the
governor
and
saluting
said
her
excellency
told
me
to
inform
you
that
she
has
gone
home
looking
at
the
way
the
policeman
put
his
stiff
frozen
fingers
to
his
cap
looking
at
his
nose
his
lustreless
eyes
and
his
hood
covered
with
white
frost
near
the
mouth
they
all
for
some
reason
felt
that
this
policeman
heart
must
be
aching
that
his
stomach
must
feel
pinched
and
his
soul
numb
i
say
said
the
governor
hesitatingly
have
a
drink
of
mulled
wine
it
all
right
it
all
right
drink
it
up
the
mayor
urged
him
gesticulating
do
be
shy
the
policeman
took
the
glass
in
both
hands
moved
aside
and
trying
to
drink
without
making
any
sound
began
discreetly
sipping
from
the
glass
he
drank
and
was
overwhelmed
with
embarrassment
while
the
old
men
looked
at
him
in
silence
and
they
all
fancied
that
the
pain
was
leaving
the
young
policeman
heart
and
that
his
soul
was
thawing
the
governor
heaved
a
sigh
it
time
we
were
at
home
he
said
getting
up
i
say
he
added
addressing
the
policeman
tell
the
musicians
there
to
leave
off
playing
and
ask
pavel
semyonovitch
from
me
to
see
they
are
given
beer
or
vodka
the
governor
and
the
bishop
said
to
the
mayor
and
went
out
of
the
pavilion
yegor
ivanitch
attacked
the
mulled
wine
and
before
the
policeman
had
finished
his
glass
succeeded
in
telling
him
a
great
many
interesting
things
he
could
not
be
silent
a
slander
serge
kapitonich
ahineev
the
writing
master
was
marrying
his
daughter
to
the
teacher
of
history
and
geography
the
wedding
festivities
were
going
off
most
successfully
in
the
drawing
room
there
was
singing
playing
and
dancing
waiters
hired
from
the
club
were
flitting
distractedly
about
the
rooms
dressed
in
black
and
dirty
white
ties
there
was
a
continual
hubbub
and
din
of
conversation
sitting
side
by
side
on
the
sofa
the
teacher
of
mathematics
tarantulov
the
french
teacher
pasdequoi
and
the
junior
assessor
of
taxes
mzda
were
talking
hurriedly
and
interrupting
one
another
as
they
described
to
the
guests
cases
of
persons
being
buried
alive
and
gave
their
opinions
on
spiritualism
none
of
them
believed
in
spiritualism
but
all
admitted
that
there
were
many
things
in
this
world
which
would
always
be
beyond
the
mind
of
man
in
the
next
room
the
literature
master
dodonsky
was
explaining
to
the
visitors
the
cases
in
which
a
sentry
has
the
right
to
fire
on
the
subjects
as
you
perceive
were
alarming
but
very
agreeable
persons
whose
social
position
precluded
them
from
entering
were
looking
in
at
the
windows
from
the
yard
just
at
midnight
the
master
of
the
house
went
into
the
kitchen
to
see
whether
everything
was
ready
for
supper
the
kitchen
from
floor
to
ceiling
was
filled
with
fumes
composed
of
goose
duck
and
many
other
odours
on
two
tables
the
accessories
the
drinks
and
light
refreshments
were
set
out
in
artistic
disorder
the
cook
marfa
a
woman
whose
figure
was
like
a
barrel
with
a
belt
around
it
was
bustling
about
the
tables
show
me
the
sturgeon
marfa
said
ahineev
rubbing
his
hands
and
licking
his
lips
what
a
perfume
i
could
eat
up
the
whole
kitchen
come
show
me
the
sturgeon
marfa
went
up
to
one
of
the
benches
and
cautiously
lifted
a
piece
of
greasy
newspaper
under
the
paper
on
an
immense
dish
there
reposed
a
huge
sturgeon
masked
in
jelly
and
decorated
with
capers
olives
and
carrots
ahineev
gazed
at
the
sturgeon
and
gasped
his
face
beamed
he
turned
his
eyes
up
he
bent
down
and
with
his
lips
emitted
the
sound
of
an
ungreased
wheel
after
standing
a
moment
he
snapped
his
fingers
with
delight
and
once
more
smacked
his
lips
the
sound
of
a
passionate
kiss
who
is
it
kissing
out
there
little
marfa
came
a
voice
from
the
next
room
and
in
the
doorway
there
appeared
the
cropped
head
of
the
assistant
usher
vankin
who
is
it
delighted
to
meet
you
sergei
kapitonich
you
a
fine
grandfather
i
must
say
with
the
fair
sex
tette

ahineev
in
confusion
who
told
you
so
you
fool
i
was
only
i
smacked
my
lips
in
reference
to
as
an
indication
of
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
the
fish
tell
that
to
the
marines
the
intrusive
face
vanished
wearing
a
broad
grin
ahineev
flushed
hang
it
he
thought
the
beast
will
go
now
and
talk
scandal
he
disgrace
me
to
all
the
town
the
brute
ahineev
went
timidly
into
the
and
looked
stealthily
round
for
vankin
vankin
was
standing
by
the
piano
and
bending
down
with
a
jaunty
air
was
whispering
something
to
the
who
was
laughing
talking
about
me
thought
ahineev
about
me
blast
him
and
she
believes
it
believes
it
she
laughs
mercy
on
us
no
i
let
it
pass
i
ca

must
do
something
to
prevent
his
being
believed
i
speak
to
them
all
and
he
be
shown
up
for
a
fool
and
a
gossip
ahineev
scratched
his
head
and
still
overcome
with
embarrassment
went
up
to
pasdequoi
i
just
been
in
the
kitchen
to
see
after
the
supper
he
said
to
the
frenchman
i
know
you
are
fond
of
fish
and
i
a
sturgeon
my
dear
fellow
beyond
everything
a
yard
and
a
half
long
ha
ha
ha
and
by
the
way
i
was
just
forgetting
in
the
kitchen
just
now
with
that
sturgeon
quite
a
little
story
i
went
into
the
kitchen
just
now
and
wanted
to
look
at
the
supper
dishes
i
looked
at
the
sturgeon
and
i
smacked
my
lips
with
relish
at
the
piquancy
of
it
and
at
the
very
moment
that
fool
vankin
came
in
and
said
ha
ha
so
you
kissing
here
kissing
marfa
the
cook
what
a
thing
to
imagine
silly
fool
the
woman
is
a
perfect
fright
like
all
the
beasts
put
together
and
he
talks
about
kissing
queer
fish
who
a
queer
fish
asked
tarantulov
coming
up
why
he
over
there
vankin
i
went
into
the
kitchen
and
he
told
the
story
of
vankin
he
amused
me
queer
fish
i
rather
kiss
a
dog
than
marfa
if
you
ask
me
added
ahineev
he
looked
round
and
saw
behind
him
mzda
we
were
talking
of
vankin
he
said
queer
fish
he
is
he
went
into
the
kitchen
saw
me
beside
marfa
and
began
inventing
all
sorts
of
silly
stories
are
you
kissing
he
says
he
must
have
had
a
drop
too
much
i
rather
kiss
a
turkeycock
than
marfa
i
said
i
a
wife
of
my
own
you
fool
said
i
he
did
amuse
me
who
amused
you
asked
the
priest
who
taught
scripture
in
the
school
going
up
to
ahineev
vankin
i
was
standing
in
the
kitchen
you
know
looking
at
the
sturgeon
and
so
on
within
half
an
hour
or
so
all
the
guests
knew
the
incident
of
the
sturgeon
and
vankin
let
him
tell
away
now
thought
ahineev
rubbing
his
hands
let
him
he
begin
telling
his
story
and
they
say
to
him
at
once
of
your
improbable
nonsense
you
fool
we
know
all
about
it
and
ahineev
was
so
relieved
that
in
his
joy
he
drank
four
glasses
too
many
after
escorting
the
young
people
to
their
room
he
went
to
bed
and
slept
like
an
innocent
babe
and
next
day
he
thought
no
more
of
the
incident
with
the
sturgeon
but
alas
man
proposes
but
god
disposes
an
evil
tongue
did
its
evil
work
and
strategy
was
of
no
avail
just
a
week
later
to
be
precise
on
wednesday
after
the
third
lesson
when
ahineev
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
teacher
room
holding
forth
on
the
vicious
propensities
of
a
boy
called
visekin
the
head
master
went
up
to
him
and
drew
him
aside
look
here
sergei
kapitonich
said
the
head
master
you
must
excuse
me
it
not
my
business
but
all
the
same
i
must
make
you
realize
it
my
duty
you
see
there
are
rumors
that
you
are
romancing
with
that
cook
it
nothing
to
do
with
me
but
flirt
with
her
kiss
her
as
you
please
but
do
let
it
be
so
public
please
i
entreat
you
do
forget
that
you
a
schoolmaster
ahineev
turned
cold
and
faint
he
went
home
like
a
man
stung
by
a
whole
swarm
of
bees
like
a
man
scalded
with
boiling
water
as
he
walked
home
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
whole
town
was
looking
at
him
as
though
he
were
smeared
with
pitch
at
home
fresh
trouble
awaited
him
why
are
you
gobbling
up
your
food
as
usual
his
wife
asked
him
at
dinner
what
are
you
so
pensive
about
brooding
over
your
amours
pining
for
your
marfa
i
know
all
about
it
mohammedan
kind
friends
have
opened
my
eyes
you
savage
and
she
slapped
him
in
the
face
he
got
up
from
the
table
not
feeling
the
earth
under
his
feet
and
without
his
hat
or
coat
made
his
way
to
vankin
he
found
him
at
home
you
scoundrel
he
addressed
him
why
have
you
covered
me
with
mud
before
all
the
town
why
did
you
set
this
slander
going
about
me
what
slander
what
are
you
talking
about
who
was
it
gossiped
of
my
kissing
marfa
was
it
you
tell
me
that
was
it
you
you
brigand
vankin
blinked
and
twitched
in
every
fibre
of
his
battered
countenance
raised
his
eyes
to
the
icon
and
articulated
god
blast
me
strike
me
blind
and
lay
me
out
if
i
said
a
single
word
about
you
may
i
be
left
without
house
and
home
may
i
be
stricken
with
worse
than
cholera
vankin
sincerity
did
not
admit
of
doubt
it
was
evidently
not
he
who
was
the
author
of
the
slander
but
who
then
who
ahineev
wondered
going
over
all
his
acquaintances
in
his
mind
and
beating
himself
on
the
breast
who
then
who
then
we
too
ask
the
reader
minds
in
ferment
from
the
annals
of
a
town
the
earth
was
like
an
oven
the
afternoon
sun
blazed
with
such
energy
that
even
the
thermometer
hanging
in
the
excise
room
lost
its
head
it
ran
up
to
and
stopped
there
irresolute
the
inhabitants
streamed
with
perspiration
like
overdriven
horses
and
were
too
lazy
to
mop
their
faces
two
of
the
inhabitants
were
walking
along
the
in
front
of
the
closely
shuttered
houses
one
was
potcheshihin
the
local
treasury
clerk
and
the
other
was
optimov
the
agent
for
many
years
a
correspondent
of
the
of
the
newspaper
they
walked
in
silence
speechless
from
the
heat
optimov
felt
tempted
to
find
fault
with
the
local
authorities
for
the
dust
and
disorder
of
the
but
aware
of
the
disposition
and
moderate
views
of
his
companion
he
said
nothing
in
the
middle
of
the
potcheshihin
suddenly
halted
and
began
gazing
into
the
sky
what
are
you
looking
at
those
starlings
that
flew
up
i
wonder
where
they
have
settled
clouds
and
clouds
of
them
if
one
were
to
go
and
take
a
shot
at
them
and
if
one
were
to
pick
them
up
and
if
they
have
settled
in
the
father
prebendary
garden
oh
no
they
are
not
in
the
father
prebendary
they
are
in
the
father
deacon
if
you
did
have
a
shot
at
them
from
here
you
would
kill
anything
fine
shot
wo
carry
so
far
it
loses
its
force
and
why
should
you
kill
them
anyway
they
birds
destructive
of
the
fruit
that
true
still
they
fowls
of
the
air
works
of
the
lord
the
starling
sings
you
know
and
what
does
it
sing
pray
a
song
of
praise
ye
fowls
of
the
air
praise
ye
the
lord
no
i
do
believe
they
have
settled
in
the
father
prebendary
garden
three
old
pilgrim
women
wearing
bark
shoes
and
carrying
wallets
passed
noiselessly
by
the
speakers
looking
enquiringly
at
the
gentlemen
who
were
for
some
unknown
reason
staring
at
the
father
prebendary
house
they
slackened
their
pace
and
when
they
were
a
few
yards
off
stopped
glanced
at
the
friends
once
more
and
then
fell
to
gazing
at
the
house
themselves
yes
you
were
right
they
have
settled
in
the
father
prebendary
said
optimov
his
cherries
are
ripe
now
so
they
have
gone
there
to
peck
them
from
the
garden
gate
emerged
the
father
prebendary
himself
accompanied
by
the
sexton
seeing
the
attention
directed
upon
his
abode
and
wondering
what
people
were
staring
at
he
stopped
and
he
too
as
well
as
the
sexton
began
looking
upwards
to
find
out
the
father
is
going
to
a
service
somewhere
i
suppose
said
potcheshihin
the
lord
be
his
succour
some
workmen
from
purov
factory
who
had
been
bathing
in
the
river
passed
between
the
friends
and
the
priest
seeing
the
latter
absorbed
in
contemplation
of
the
heavens
and
the
pilgrim
women
too
standing
motionless
with
their
eyes
turned
upwards
they
stood
still
and
stared
in
the
same
direction
a
small
boy
leading
a
blind
beggar
and
a
peasant
carrying
a
tub
of
stinking
fish
to
throw
into
the
did
the
same
there
must
be
something
the
matter
i
should
think
said
potcheshihin
a
fire
or
something
but
there
no
sign
of
smoke
anywhere
hey
kuzma
he
shouted
to
the
peasant
what
the
matter
the
peasant
made
some
reply
but
potcheshihin
and
optimov
did
not
catch
it
shopmen
made
their
appearance
at
the
doors
of
all
the
shops
some
plasterers
at
work
on
a
warehouse
near
left
their
ladders
and
joined
the
workmen
the
fireman
who
was
describing
circles
with
his
bare
feet
on
the
halted
and
after
looking
steadily
at
them
for
a
few
minutes
came
down
the
was
left
deserted
this
seemed
suspicious

must
be
a
fire

the
starlings
rose
in
a
black
cloud
from
the
father
garden
but
potcheshihin
and
optimov
did
not
notice
them
they
stood
staring
into
the
air
wondering
what
could
have
attracted
such
a
crowd
and
what
it
was
looking
at
akim
danilitch
appeared
still
munching
and
wiping
his
lips
he
cut
his
way
into
the
crowd
bellowing
firemen
be
ready
disperse
optimov
disperse
or
it
be
the
worse
for
you
instead
of
writing
all
kinds
of
things

decent
people
in
the
papers

had
better
try
to
behave
yourself
more
conformably
no
good
ever
comes
of
reading
the
papers
kindly
refrain
from
reflections
upon
literature
cried
optimov
hotly
i
am
a
literary
man
and
i
will
allow
no
one
to
make
reflections
upon
literature
though
as
is
the
duty
of
a
citizen
i
respect
you
as
a
father
and
benefactor
firemen

the
hose
on
them

water

that
to
your
taste
put
him
down
the
devil
i
lost
my
pencil
please
your
honour
the
crowd
grew
larger
and
larger
there
is
no
telling
what
proportions
it
might
have
reached
if
the
new
organ
just
arrived
from
moscow
had
not
fortunately
begun
playing
in
the
tavern
close
by
hearing
their
favourite
tune
the
crowd
gasped
and
rushed
off
to
the
tavern
so
nobody
ever
knew
why
the
crowd
had
assembled
and
potcheshihin
and
optimov
had
by
now
forgotten
the
existence
of
the
starlings
who
were
innocently
responsible
for
the
proceedings
an
hour
later
the
town
was
still
and
silent
again
and
only
a
solitary
figure
was
to
be
seen
the
fireman
pacing
round
and
round
on
the
the
same
evening
akim
danilitch
sat
in
the
grocer
shop
drinking
and
brandy
and
writing
in
addition
to
the
official
report
i
venture
your
excellency
to
append
a
few
supplementary
observations
of
my
own
father
and
benefactor
in
very
truth
but
for
the
prayers
of
your
virtuous
spouse
in
her
salubrious
villa
near
our
town
there
no
knowing
what
might
not
have
come
to
pass
what
i
have
been
through
i
can
find
no
words
to
express
the
efficiency
of
krushensky
and
of
the
major
of
the
fire
brigade
are
beyond
all
praise
i
am
proud
of
such
devoted
servants
of
our
country
as
for
me
i
did
all
that
a
weak
man
could
do
whose
only
desire
is
the
welfare
of
his
neighbour
and
sitting
now
in
the
bosom
of
my
family
with
tears
in
my
eyes
i
thank
him
who
spared
us
bloodshed
in
absence
of
evidence
the
guilty
parties
remain
in
custody
but
i
propose
to
release
them
in
a
week
or
so
it
was
their
ignorance
that
led
them
astray
gone
astray
a
country
village
wrapped
in
the
darkness
of
night
one
strikes
from
the
belfry

of

cottages

says
kozyavkin

a
deep
breath
tramping

flies
crowing
over
laev
head
laev
heaves
a
deep
sigh
and
with
a
hopeless
gesture
sits
down
on
a
stone
he
is
beset
with
a
burning
thirst
his
eyes
are
closing
his
head
drops
forward
five
minutes
pass
ten
twenty
and
kozyavkin
is
still
busy
among
the
hens
petya
will

be
long
a
minute
i
found
the
portfolio
but
i
have
lost
it
again
laev
lays
his
head
on
his
fists
and
closes
his
eyes
the
cackling
of
the
fowls
grows
louder
and
louder
the
inhabitants
of
the
empty
cottage
fly
out
of
the
window
and
flutter
round
in
circles
he
fancies
like
owls
over
his
head
his
ears
ring
with
their
cackle
he
is
overwhelmed
with
terror
the
beast
he
thinks
he
invited
me
to
stay
promising
me
wine
and
junket
and
then
he
makes
me
walk
from
the
station
and
listen
to
these
hens
in
the
midst
of
his
indignation
his
chin
sinks
into
his
collar
he
lays
his
head
on
his
portfolio
and
gradually
subsides
weariness
gets
the
upper
hand
and
he
begins
to
doze
i
found
the
portfolio
he
hears
kozyavkin
cry
triumphantly
i
shall
find
the
cape
in
a
minute
and
then
off
we
go
then
through
his
sleep
he
hears
the
barking
of
dogs
first
one
dog
barks
then
a
second
and
a
third
and
the
barking
of
the
dogs
blends
with
the
cackling
of
the
fowls
into
a
sort
of
savage
music
someone
comes
up
to
laev
and
asks
him
something
then
he
hears
someone
climb
over
his
head
into
the
window
then
a
knocking
and
a
shouting
a
woman
in
a
red
apron
stands
beside
him
with
a
lantern
in
her
hand
and
asks
him
something

no
right
to
say
so
he
hears
kozyavkin

be
here
directly
we
know
all
the
summer
visitors
here
but
i
never
seen
you
in
my
life
i
had
a
cottage
in
rottendale
for
five
years
whew
do
you
take
this
for
the
dale
this
is
sicklystead
but
rottendale
is
farther
to
the
right
beyond
the
match
factory
three
miles
from
here
bless
my
soul
then
i
taken
the
wrong
turning
the
cries
of
men
and
fowls
mingle
with
the
barking
of
dogs
and
the
voice
of
kozyavkin
rises
above
the
chaos
of
confused
sounds
you
shut
up
i
pay
i
show
you
whom
you
have
to
deal
with
little
by
little
the
voices
die
down
laev
feels
himself
being
shaken
by
the
shoulder
an
avenger
shortly
after
finding
his
wife
flagrante
fyodor
fyodorovitch
sigaev
was
standing
in
schmuck
and
the
gunsmiths
selecting
a
suitable
revolver
his
countenance
expressed
wrath
grief
and
unalterable
determination
i
know
what
i
must
do
he
was
thinking
the
sanctities
of
the
home
are
outraged
honour
is
trampled
in
the
mud
vice
is
triumphant
and
therefore
as
a
citizen
and
a
man
of
honour
i
must
be
their
avenger
first
i
will
kill
her
and
her
lover
and
then
myself
he
had
not
yet
chosen
a
revolver
or
killed
anyone
but
already
in
imagination
he
saw
three
bloodstained
corpses
broken
skulls
brains
oozing
from
them
the
commotion
the
crowd
of
gaping
spectators
the
with
the
malignant
joy
of
an
insulted
man
he
pictured
the
horror
of
the
relations
and
the
public
the
agony
of
the
traitress
and
was
mentally
reading
leading
articles
on
the
destruction
of
the
traditions
of
the
home
the
shopman
a
sprightly
little
frenchified
figure
with
rounded
belly
and
white
waistcoat
displayed
the
revolvers
and
smiling
respectfully
and
scraping
with
his
little
feet
observed
i
would
advise
you
to
take
this
superb
revolver
the
smith
and
wesson
pattern
the
last
word
in
the
science
of
firearms
with
ejector
kills
at
six
hundred
paces
central
sight
let
me
draw
your
attention
to
the
beauty
of
the
finish
the
most
fashionable
system
we
sell
a
dozen
every
day
for
burglars
wolves
and
lovers
very
correct
and
powerful
action
hits
at
a
great
distance
and
kills
wife
and
lover
with
one
bullet
as
for
suicide
i
do
know
a
better
pattern
the
shopman
pulled
and
cocked
the
trigger
breathed
on
the
barrel
took
aim
and
affected
to
be
breathless
with
delight
looking
at
his
ecstatic
countenance
one
might
have
supposed
that
he
would
readily
have
put
a
bullet
through
his
brains
if
he
had
only
possessed
a
revolver
of
such
a
superb
pattern
as
a
and
what
price
asked
sigaev
roubles
mm
that
too
dear
for
me
in
that
case
let
me
offer
you
another
make
somewhat
cheaper
here
if
you
kindly
look
we
have
an
immense
choice
at
all
prices
here
for
instance
this
revolver
of
the
lefaucher
pattern
costs
only
eighteen
roubles
but
the
shopman
pursed
up
his
face
contemptuously
but
an
make
they
are
only
bought
by
hysterical
ladies
or
the
mentally
deficient
to
commit
suicide
or
shoot
one
wife
with
a
lefaucher
revolver
is
considered
bad
form
nowadays
is
the
only
pattern
that
correct
style
i
do
want
to
shoot
myself
or
to
kill
anyone
said
sigaev
lying
sullenly
i
am
buying
it
simply
for
a
country
cottage
to
frighten
away
burglars
that
not
our
business
what
object
you
have
in
buying
it
the
shopman
smiled
dropping
his
eyes
discreetly
if
we
were
to
investigate
the
object
in
each
case
we
should
have
to
close
our
shop
to
frighten
burglars
lefaucher
is
not
a
suitable
pattern
for
it
goes
off
with
a
faint
muffled
sound
i
would
suggest
mortimer
the
duelling
pistol
should
i
challenge
him
to
a
duel
flashed
through
mind
it
doing
him
too
much
honour
though
beasts
like
that
are
killed
like
dogs
the
shopman
swaying
gracefully
and
tripping
to
and
fro
on
his
little
feet
still
smiling
and
chattering
displayed
before
him
a
heap
of
revolvers
the
most
inviting
and
impressive
of
all
was
the
smith
and
wesson
sigaev
picked
up
a
pistol
of
that
pattern
gazed
blankly
at
it
and
sank
into
brooding
his
imagination
pictured
how
he
would
blow
out
their
brains
how
blood
would
flow
in
streams
over
the
rug
and
the
parquet
how
the
traitress
legs
would
twitch
in
her
last
agony
but
that
was
not
enough
for
his
indignant
soul
the
picture
of
blood
wailing
and
horror
did
not
satisfy
him
he
must
think
of
something
more
terrible
i
know
i
kill
myself
and
him
he
thought
but
i
leave
her
alive
let
her
pine
away
from
the
stings
of
conscience
and
the
contempt
of
all
surrounding
her
for
a
sensitive
nature
like
hers
that
will
be
far
more
agonizing
than
death
and
he
imagined
his
own
funeral
he
the
injured
husband
lies
in
his
coffin
with
a
gentle
smile
on
his
lips
and
she
pale
tortured
by
remorse
follows
the
coffin
like
a
niobe
not
knowing
where
to
hide
herself
to
escape
from
the
withering
contemptuous
looks
cast
upon
her
by
the
indignant
crowd
i
see
that
you
like
the
smith
and
wesson
make
the
shopman
broke
in
upon
his
broodings
if
you
think
it
too
dear
very
well
i
knock
off
five
roubles
but
we
have
other
makes
cheaper
the
little
frenchified
figure
turned
gracefully
and
took
down
another
dozen
cases
of
revolvers
from
the
shelf
here
price
thirty
roubles
that
not
expensive
especially
as
the
rate
of
exchange
has
dropped
terribly
and
the
customs
duties
are
rising
every
hour
i
vow
i
am
a
conservative
but
even
i
am
beginning
to
murmur
why
with
the
rate
of
exchange
and
the
customs
tariff
only
the
rich
can
purchase
firearms
there
nothing
left
for
the
poor
but
tula
weapons
and
phosphorus
matches
and
tula
weapons
are
a
misery
you
may
aim
at
your
wife
with
a
tula
revolver
and
shoot
yourself
through
the
sigaev
suddenly
felt
mortified
and
sorry
that
he
would
be
dead
and
would
miss
seeing
the
agonies
of
the
traitress
revenge
is
only
sweet
when
one
can
see
and
taste
its
fruits
and
what
sense
would
there
be
in
it
if
he
were
lying
in
his
coffin
knowing
nothing
about
it
had
i
better
do
this
he
pondered
i
kill
him
then
go
to
his
funeral
and
look
on
and
after
the
funeral
i
kill
myself
they
arrest
me
though
before
the
funeral
and
take
away
my
pistol
and
so
i
kill
him
she
shall
remain
alive
and
i
for
the
time
i
not
kill
myself
but
go
and
be
arrested
i
shall
always
have
time
to
kill
myself
there
will
be
this
advantage
about
being
arrested
that
at
the
preliminary
investigation
i
shall
have
an
opportunity
of
exposing
to
the
authorities
and
to
the
public
all
the
infamy
of
her
conduct
if
i
kill
myself
she
may
with
her
characteristic
duplicity
and
impudence
throw
all
the
blame
on
me
and
society
will
justify
her
behaviour
and
will
very
likely
laugh
at
me
if
i
remain
alive
then
a
minute
later
he
was
thinking
yes
if
i
kill
myself
i
may
be
blamed
and
suspected
of
petty
feeling
besides
why
should
i
kill
myself
that
one
thing
and
for
another
to
shoot
oneself
is
cowardly
and
so
i
kill
him
and
let
her
live
and
i
face
my
trial
i
shall
be
tried
and
she
will
be
brought
into
court
as
a
witness
i
can
imagine
her
confusion
her
disgrace
when
she
is
examined
by
my
counsel
the
sympathies
of
the
court
of
the
press
and
of
the
public
will
certainly
be
with
me
while
he
deliberated
the
shopman
displayed
his
wares
and
felt
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
entertain
his
customer
here
are
english
ones
a
new
pattern
only
just
received
he
prattled
on
but
i
warn
you
all
these
systems
pale
beside
the
smith
and
wesson
the
other
day
as
i
dare
say
you
have
read
an
officer
bought
from
us
a
smith
and
wesson
he
shot
his
wife
lover
you
believe
it
the
bullet
passed
through
him
pierced
the
bronze
lamp
then
the
piano
and
ricochetted
back
from
the
piano
killing
the
and
bruising
the
wife
a
magnificent
record
redounding
to
the
honour
of
our
firm
the
officer
is
now
under
arrest
he
will
no
doubt
be
convicted
and
sent
to
penal
servitude
in
the
first
place
our
penal
code
is
quite
out
of
date
and
secondly
the
sympathies
of
the
court
are
always
with
the
lover
why
is
it
very
simple
the
judges
and
the
jury
and
the
prosecutor
and
the
counsel
for
the
defence
are
all
living
with
other
men
wives
and
it
add
to
their
comfort
that
there
will
be
one
husband
the
less
in
russia
society
would
be
pleased
if
the
government
were
to
send
all
the
husbands
to
sahalin
oh
you
do
know
how
it
excites
my
indignation
to
see
the
corruption
of
morals
nowadays
to
love
other
men
wives
is
as
much
the
regular
thing
as
to
smoke
other
men
cigarettes
and
to
read
other
men
books
every
year
our
trade
gets
worse
and
worse
it
does
mean
that
wives
are
more
faithful
but
that
husbands
resign
themselves
to
their
position
and
are
afraid
of
the
law
and
penal
servitude
the
shopman
looked
round
and
whispered
and
whose
fault
is
it
the
government
to
go
to
sahalin
for
the
sake
of
a
pig
like
that
there
no
sense
in
that
either
sigaev
pondered
if
i
go
to
penal
servitude
it
will
only
give
my
wife
an
opportunity
of
marrying
again
and
deceiving
a
second
husband
she
would
triumph
and
so
i
will
leave
alive
i
wo
kill
myself
i
wo
kill
either
i
must
think
of
something
more
sensible
and
more
effective
i
will
punish
them
with
my
contempt
and
will
take
divorce
proceedings
that
will
make
a
scandal
here
is
another
make
said
the
shopman
taking
down
another
dozen
from
the
shelf
let
me
call
your
attention
to
the
original
mechanism
of
the
lock
in
view
of
his
determination
a
revolver
was
now
of
no
use
to
sigaev
but
the
shopman
meanwhile
getting
more
and
more
enthusiastic
persisted
in
displaying
his
wares
before
him
the
outraged
husband
began
to
feel
ashamed
that
the
shopman
should
be
taking
so
much
trouble
on
his
account
for
nothing
that
he
should
be
smiling
wasting
time
displaying
enthusiasm
for
nothing
very
well
in
that
case
he
muttered
i
look
in
again
later
on
or
i
send
someone
he
did
see
the
expression
of
the
shopman
face
but
to
smooth
over
the
awkwardness
of
the
position
a
little
he
felt
called
upon
to
make
some
purchase
but
what
should
he
buy
he
looked
round
the
walls
of
the
shop
to
pick
out
something
inexpensive
and
his
eyes
rested
on
a
green
net
hanging
near
the
door
that
what
that
he
asked
that
a
net
for
catching
quails
and
what
price
is
it
eight
roubles
wrap
it
up
for
me
the
outraged
husband
paid
his
eight
roubles
took
the
net
and
feeling
even
more
outraged
walked
out
of
the
shop
the
jeune
premier
yevgeny
alexeyitch
podzharov
the
a
graceful
elegant
young
man
with
an
oval
face
and
little
bags
under
his
eyes
had
come
for
the
season
to
one
of
the
southern
towns
of
russia
and
tried
at
once
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
a
few
of
the
leading
families
of
the
place
yes
signor
he
would
often
say
gracefully
swinging
his
foot
and
displaying
his
red
socks
an
artist
ought
to
act
upon
the
masses
both
directly
and
indirectly
the
first
aim
is
attained
by
his
work
on
the
stage
the
second
by
an
acquaintance
with
the
local
inhabitants
on
my
honour
i
do
understand
why
it
is
we
actors
avoid
making
acquaintance
with
local
families
why
is
it
to
say
nothing
of
dinners
parties
feasts
to
say
nothing
of
these
entertainments
think
of
the
moral
influence
we
may
have
on
society
is
it
not
agreeable
to
feel
one
has
dropped
a
spark
in
some
thick
skull
the
types
one
meets
the
women
what
women
they
turn
head
one
penetrates
into
some
huge
merchant
house
into
the
sacred
retreats
and
picks
out
some
fresh
and
rosy
little
peach
it
heaven
in
the
southern
town
among
other
estimable
families
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
that
of
a
manufacturer
called
zybaev
whenever
he
remembers
that
acquaintance
now
he
frowns
contemptuously
screws
up
his
eyes
and
nervously
plays
with
his
one
day
it
was
at
a
party
at
zybaev
the
actor
was
sitting
in
his
new
friends
and
holding
forth
as
usual
around
him
types
were
sitting
in
armchairs
and
on
the
sofa
listening
affably
from
the
next
room
came
feminine
laughter
and
the
sounds
of
evening
tea
crossing
his
legs
after
each
phrase
sipping
tea
with
rum
in
it
and
trying
to
assume
an
expression
of
careless
boredom
he
talked
of
his
stage
triumphs
i
am
a
provincial
actor
principally
he
said
smiling
condescendingly
but
i
have
played
in
petersburg
and
moscow
too
by
the
way
i
will
describe
an
incident
which
illustrates
pretty
well
the
state
of
mind
of
at
my
benefit
in
moscow
the
young
people
brought
me
such
a
mass
of
laurel
wreaths
that
i
swear
by
all
i
hold
sacred
i
did
not
know
where
to
put
them
later
on
at
a
moment
when
funds
were
short
i
took
the
laurel
wreaths
to
the
shop
and
guess
what
they
weighed
eighty
pounds
altogether
ha
ha
you
ca
think
how
useful
the
money
was
artists
indeed
are
often
hard
up
i
have
hundreds
thousands
tomorrow
nothing
i
have
a
crust
of
bread
i
have
oysters
and
anchovies
hang
it
all
the
local
inhabitants
sipped
their
glasses
decorously
and
listened
the
host
not
knowing
how
to
make
enough
of
his
cultured
and
interesting
visitor
presented
to
him
a
distant
relative
who
had
just
arrived
one
pavel
ignatyevitch
klimov
a
bulky
gentleman
about
forty
wearing
a
long
and
very
full
trousers
you
ought
to
know
each
other
said
zybaev
as
he
presented
klimov
he
loves
theatres
and
at
one
time
used
to
act
himself
he
has
an
estate
in
the
tula
province
podzharov
and
klimov
got
into
conversation
it
appeared
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
both
that
the
tula
landowner
lived
in
the
very
town
in
which
the
had
acted
for
two
seasons
in
succession
enquiries
followed
about
the
town
about
common
acquaintances
and
about
the
theatre
do
you
know
i
like
that
town
awfully
said
the
jeune
premier
displaying
his
red
socks
what
streets
what
a
charming
park
and
what
society
delightful
society
yes
delightful
society
the
landowner
assented
a
commercial
town
but
extremely
cultured
for
instance
the
head
master
of
the
high
school
the
public
prosecutor
the
officers
the
police
captain
too
was
not
bad
a
man
as
the
french
say
enchanté
and
the
women
allah
what
women
yes
the
women
certainly
perhaps
i
am
partial
the
fact
is
that
in
your
town
i
do
know
why
i
was
devilishly
lucky
with
the
fair
sex
i
could
write
a
dozen
novels
to
take
this
episode
for
instance
i
was
staying
in
yegoryevsky
street
in
the
very
house
where
the
treasury
is
the
red
house
without
stucco
yes
yes
without
stucco
close
by
as
i
remember
now
lived
a
local
beauty
varenka
not
varvara
nikolayevna
asked
klimov
and
he
beamed
with
satisfaction
she
really
is
a
beauty
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
the
town
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
the
town
a
classic
profile
great
black
eyes
and
hair
to
her
waist
she
saw
me
in
she
wrote
me
a
letter
pushkin
i
answered
as
you
may
guess
podzharov
looked
round
and
having
satisfied
himself
that
there
were
no
ladies
in
the
room
rolled
his
eyes
smiled
mournfully
and
heaved
a
sigh
i
came
home
one
evening
after
a
performance
he
whispered
and
there
she
was
sitting
on
my
sofa
there
followed
tears
protestations
of
love
kisses
oh
that
was
a
marvellous
that
was
a
divine
night
our
romance
lasted
two
months
but
that
night
was
never
repeated
it
was
a
night
parole
excuse
me
what
that
muttered
klimov
turning
crimson
and
gazing
at
the
actor
i
know
varvara
nikolayevna
well
she
my
niece
podzharov
was
embarrassed
and
he
too
opened
his
eyes
wide
how
this
klimov
went
on
throwing
up
his
hands
i
know
the
girl
and
and
i
am
surprised
i
am
very
sorry
this
has
come
up
muttered
the
actor
getting
up
and
rubbing
something
out
of
his
left
eye
with
his
little
finger
though
of
course
of
course
you
as
her
uncle
the
other
guests
who
had
hitherto
been
listening
to
the
actor
with
pleasure
and
rewarding
him
with
smiles
were
embarrassed
and
dropped
their
eyes
please
do
be
so
good
take
your
words
back
said
klimov
in
extreme
embarrassment
i
beg
you
to
do
so
if
it
offends
you
certainly
answered
the
actor
with
an
undefined
movement
of
his
hand
and
confess
you
have
told
a
falsehood
i
no
it
was
not
a
lie
but
i
greatly
regret
having
spoken
too
freely
and
in
fact
i
do
understand
your
tone
klimov
walked
up
and
down
the
room
in
silence
as
though
in
uncertainty
and
hesitation
his
fleshy
face
grew
more
and
more
crimson
and
the
veins
in
his
neck
swelled
up
after
walking
up
and
down
for
about
two
minutes
he
went
up
to
the
actor
and
said
in
a
tearful
voice
no
do
be
so
good
as
to
confess
that
you
told
a
lie
about
varenka
have
the
goodness
to
do
so
it
queer
said
the
actor
with
a
strained
smile
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
swinging
his
leg
this
is
positively
insulting
so
you
will
not
confess
it
i
understand
you
will
not
in
that
case
excuse
me
i
shall
have
to
resort
to
unpleasant
measures
either
sir
i
shall
insult
you
at
once
on
the
spot
or
if
you
are
an
honourable
man
you
will
kindly
accept
my
challenge
to
a
duel
we
will
fight
certainly
rapped
out
the
jeune
premier
with
a
contemptuous
gesture
certainly
extremely
perturbed
the
guests
and
the
host
not
knowing
what
to
do
drew
klimov
aside
and
began
begging
him
not
to
get
up
a
scandal
astonished
feminine
countenances
appeared
in
the
doorway
the
jeune
premier
turned
round
said
a
few
words
and
with
an
air
of
being
unable
to
remain
in
a
house
where
he
was
insulted
took
his
cap
and
made
off
without
saying
on
his
way
home
the
jeune
premier
smiled
contemptuously
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
when
he
reached
his
hotel
room
and
stretched
himself
on
his
sofa
he
felt
exceedingly
uneasy
the
devil
take
him
he
thought
a
duel
does
not
matter
he
kill
me
but
the
trouble
is
the
other
fellows
will
hear
of
it
and
they
know
perfectly
well
it
was
a
yarn
it
abominable
i
shall
be
disgraced
all
over
russia
podzharov
thought
a
little
smoked
and
to
calm
himself
went
out
into
the
street
i
ought
to
talk
to
this
bully
ram
into
his
stupid
noddle
that
he
is
a
blockhead
and
a
fool
and
that
i
am
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
him
the
jeune
premier
stopped
before
zybaev
house
and
looked
at
the
windows
lights
were
still
burning
behind
the
muslin
curtains
and
figures
were
moving
about
i
wait
for
him
the
actor
decided
it
was
dark
and
cold
a
hateful
autumn
rain
was
drizzling
as
though
through
a
sieve
podzharov
leaned
his
elbow
on
a
and
abandoned
himself
to
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
he
was
wet
through
and
exhausted
at
two
in
the
night
the
guests
began
coming
out
of
house
the
landowner
from
tula
was
the
last
to
make
his
appearance
he
heaved
a
sigh
that
could
be
heard
by
the
whole
street
and
scraped
the
pavement
with
his
heavy
overboots
excuse
me
said
the
jeune
premier
overtaking
him
one
minute
klimov
stopped
the
actor
gave
a
smile
hesitated
and
began
stammering
i
i
confess
i
told
a
lie
no
sir
you
will
please
confess
that
publicly
said
klimov
and
he
turned
crimson
again
i
ca
leave
it
like
that
but
you
see
i
am
apologizing
i
beg
you
do
you
understand
i
beg
you
because
you
will
admit
a
duel
will
make
talk
and
i
am
in
a
position
my
goodness
knows
what
they
may
think
the
jeune
premier
tried
to
appear
unconcerned
to
smile
to
stand
erect
but
his
body
would
not
obey
him
his
voice
trembled
his
eyes
blinked
guiltily
and
his
head
drooped
for
a
good
while
he
went
on
muttering
something
klimov
listened
to
him
thought
a
little
and
heaved
a
sigh
well
so
be
it
he
said
may
god
forgive
you
only
do
lie
in
future
young
man
nothing
degrades
a
man
like
lying
yes
indeed
you
are
a
young
man
you
have
had
a
good
education
the
landowner
from
tula
in
a
benignant
fatherly
way
gave
him
a
lecture
while
the
jeune
premier
listened
and
smiled
meekly
when
it
was
over
he
smirked
bowed
and
with
a
guilty
step
and
a
crestfallen
air
set
off
for
his
hotel
as
he
went
to
bed
half
an
hour
later
he
felt
that
he
was
out
of
danger
and
was
already
in
excellent
spirits
serene
and
satisfied
that
the
misunderstanding
had
ended
so
satisfactorily
he
wrapped
himself
in
the
bedclothes
soon
fell
asleep
and
slept
soundly
till
ten
next
morning
a
defenceless
creature
in
spite
of
a
violent
attack
of
gout
in
the
night
and
the
nervous
exhaustion
left
by
it
kistunov
went
in
the
morning
to
his
office
and
began
punctually
seeing
the
clients
of
the
bank
and
persons
who
had
come
with
petitions
he
looked
languid
and
exhausted
and
spoke
in
a
faint
voice
hardly
above
a
whisper
as
though
he
were
dying
what
can
i
do
for
you
he
asked
a
lady
in
an
antediluvian
mantle
whose
back
view
was
extremely
suggestive
of
a
huge
you
see
your
excellency
the
petitioner
in
question
began
speaking
rapidly
my
husband
shtchukin
a
collegiate
assessor
was
ill
for
five
months
and
while
he
if
you
will
excuse
my
saying
so
was
laid
up
at
home
he
was
for
no
sort
of
reason
dismissed
your
excellency
and
when
i
went
for
his
salary
they
deducted
if
you
please
your
excellency
roubles
kopecks
from
his
salary
for
i
asked
borrowed
from
the
club
fund
they
told
me
the
other
clerks
had
stood
security
for
him
how
was
that
how
could
he
have
borrowed
it
without
my
consent
it
impossible
your
excellency
what
the
reason
of
it
i
am
a
poor
woman
i
earn
my
bread
by
taking
in
lodgers
i
am
a
weak
defenceless
woman
i
have
to
put
up
with
from
everyone
and
never
hear
a
kind
word
the
petitioner
was
blinking
and
dived
into
her
mantle
for
her
handkerchief
kistunov
took
her
petition
from
her
and
began
reading
it
excuse
me
what
this
he
asked
shrugging
his
shoulders
i
can
make
nothing
of
it
evidently
you
have
come
to
the
wrong
place
madam
your
petition
has
nothing
to
do
with
us
at
all
you
will
have
to
apply
to
the
department
in
which
your
husband
was
employed
why
my
dear
sir
i
have
been
to
five
places
already
and
they
would
not
even
take
the
petition
anywhere
said
madame
shtchukin
i
quite
lost
my
head
but
thank
goodness
god
bless
him
for
it
my
boris
matveyitch
advised
me
to
come
to
you
go
to
kistunov
mamma
he
is
an
influential
man
he
can
do
anything
for
you
help
me
your
excellency
we
can
do
nothing
for
you
madame
shtchukin
you
must
understand
your
husband
served
in
the
army
medical
department
and
our
establishment
is
a
purely
private
commercial
undertaking
a
bank
surely
you
must
understand
that
kistunov
shrugged
his
shoulders
again
and
turned
to
a
gentleman
in
a
military
uniform
with
a
swollen
face
your
excellency
piped
madame
shtchukin
in
a
pitiful
voice
i
have
the
doctor
certificate
that
my
husband
was
ill
here
it
is
if
you
will
kindly
look
at
it
very
good
i
believe
you
kistunov
said
irritably
but
i
repeat
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
us
it
queer
and
positively
absurd
surely
your
husband
must
know
where
you
are
to
apply
he
knows
nothing
your
excellency
he
keeps
on
not
your
business
get
away
that
all
i
can
get
out
of
him
whose
business
is
it
then
it
i
have
to
keep
them
all
kistunov
again
turned
to
madame
shtchukin
and
began
explaining
to
her
the
difference
between
the
army
medical
department
and
a
private
bank
she
listened
attentively
nodded
in
token
of
assent
and
said
yes
yes
yes
i
understand
sir
in
that
case
your
excellency
tell
them
to
pay
me
fifteen
roubles
at
least
i
agree
to
take
part
on
account
ough
sighed
kistunov
letting
his
head
drop
back
there
no
making
you
see
reason
do
understand
that
to
apply
to
us
with
such
a
petition
is
as
strange
as
to
send
in
a
petition
concerning
divorce
for
instance
to
a
chemist
or
to
the
assaying
board
you
have
not
been
paid
your
due
but
what
have
we
to
do
with
it
your
excellency
make
me
remember
you
in
my
prayers
for
the
rest
of
my
days
have
pity
on
a
lone
lorn
woman
wailed
madame
shtchukin
i
am
a
weak
defenceless
woman
i
am
worried
to
death
to
settle
with
the
lodgers
and
see
to
my
husband
affairs
and
fly
round
looking
after
the
house
and
i
am
going
to
church
every
day
this
week
and
my
is
out
of
a
job
i
might
as
well
not
eat
or
drink
i
can
scarcely
keep
on
my
feet
i
have
slept
all
night
kistunov
was
conscious
of
the
palpitation
of
his
heart
with
a
face
of
anguish
pressing
his
hand
on
his
heart
he
began
explaining
to
madame
shtchukin
again
but
his
voice
failed
him
no
excuse
me
i
can
not
talk
to
you
he
said
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
my
head
going
round
you
are
hindering
us
and
wasting
your
time
ough
alexey
nikolaitch
he
said
addressing
one
of
his
clerks
please
will
you
explain
to
madame
shtchukin
kistunov
passing
by
all
the
petitioners
went
to
his
private
room
and
signed
about
a
dozen
papers
while
alexey
nikolaitch
was
still
engaged
with
madame
shtchukin
as
he
sat
in
his
room
kistunov
heard
two
voices
the
monotonous
restrained
bass
of
alexey
nikolaitch
and
the
shrill
wailing
voice
of
madame
shtchukin
i
am
a
weak
defenceless
woman
i
am
a
woman
in
delicate
health
said
madame
shtchukin
i
look
strong
but
if
you
were
to
overhaul
me
there
is
not
one
healthy
fibre
in
me
i
can
scarcely
keep
on
my
feet
and
my
appetite
is
gone
i
drank
my
cup
of
coffee
this
morning
without
the
slightest
relish
alexey
nikolaitch
explained
to
her
the
difference
between
the
departments
and
the
complicated
system
of
sending
in
papers
he
was
soon
exhausted
and
his
place
was
taken
by
the
accountant
a
wonderfully
disagreeable
woman
said
kistunov
revolted
nervously
cracking
his
fingers
and
continually
going
to
the
decanter
of
water
she
a
perfect
idiot
she
worn
me
out
and
she
exhaust
them
the
nasty
creature
ough
my
heart
is
throbbing
half
an
hour
later
he
rang
his
bell
alexey
nikolaitch
made
his
appearance
how
are
things
going
kistunov
asked
languidly
we
ca
make
her
see
anything
pyotr
alexandritch
we
are
simply
done
we
talk
of
one
thing
and
she
talks
of
something
else
i
i
ca
stand
the
sound
of
her
voice
i
am
ill
i
ca
bear
it
send
for
the
porter
pyotr
alexandritch
let
him
put
her
out
no
no
cried
kistunov
in
alarm
she
will
set
up
a
squeal
and
there
are
lots
of
flats
in
this
building
and
goodness
knows
what
they
would
think
of
us
do
try
and
explain
to
her
my
dear
fellow
a
minute
later
the
deep
drone
of
alexey
nikolaitch
voice
was
audible
again
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
and
instead
of
his
bass
there
was
the
murmur
of
the
accountant
powerful
tenor
nasty
woman
kistunov
thought
indignantly
nervously
shrugging
his
shoulders
no
more
brains
than
a
sheep
i
believe
that
a
twinge
of
the
gout
again
my
migraine
is
coming
back
in
the
next
room
alexey
nikolaitch
at
the
end
of
his
resources
at
last
tapped
his
finger
on
the
table
and
then
on
his
own
forehead
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
you
have
a
head
on
your
shoulders
he
said
but
this
come
come
said
the
old
lady
offended
talk
to
your
own
wife
like
that
you
screw
do
be
too
free
with
your
hands
and
looking
at
her
with
fury
with
exasperation
as
though
he
would
devour
her
alexey
nikolaitch
said
in
a
quiet
stifled
voice
clear
out
squealed
madame
shtchukin
how
dare
you
i
am
a
weak
defenceless
woman
i
wo
endure
it
my
husband
is
a
collegiate
assessor

to
dmitri
karlitch
the
lawyer
and
there

of

the
law
of
three
lodgers
and
i
will
make

down
at
my
feet
for
your
saucy
words
i
go
to
your
general
your
excellency
your
excellency
be
off
you
pest
hissed
alexey
nikolaitch
kistunov
opened
his
door
and
looked
into
the
office
what
is
it
he
asked
in
a
tearful
voice
madame
shtchukin
as
red
as
a
crab
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
rolling
her
eyes
and
prodding
the
air
with
her
fingers
the
bank
clerks
were
standing
round
red
in
the
face
too
and
evidently
harassed
were
looking
at
each
other
distractedly
your
excellency
cried
madame
shtchukin
pouncing
upon
kistunov
here
this
man
he
here
this
man
she
pointed
to
alexey
nikolaitch
tapped
himself
on
the
forehead
and
then
tapped
the
table
you
told
him
to
go
into
my
case
and
he
jeering
at
me
i
am
a
weak
defenceless
woman
my
husband
is
a
collegiate
assessor
and
i
am
a
major
daughter
myself
very
good
madam
moaned
kistunov
i
will

into
it
i
will
take
steps
go
away
later
and
when
shall
i
get
the
money
your
excellency
i
need
it
kistunov
passed
his
trembling
hand
over
his
forehead
heaved
a
sigh
and
began
explaining
again
madam
i
have
told
you
already
this
is
a
bank
a
private
commercial
establishment
what
do
you
want
of
us
and
do
understand
that
you
are
hindering
us
madame
shtchukin
listened
to
him
and
sighed
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
she
assented
only
your
excellency
do
me
the
kindness
make
me
pray
for
you
for
the
rest
of
my
life
be
a
father
protect
me
if
a
medical
certificate
is
not
enough
i
can
produce
an
affidavit
from
the
police
tell
them
to
give
me
the
money
everything
began
swimming
before
kistunov
eyes
he
breathed
out
all
the
air
in
his
lungs
in
a
prolonged
sigh
and
sank
helpless
on
a
chair
how
much
do
you
want
he
asked
in
a
weak
voice
roubles
and
kopecks
kistunov
took
his
out
of
his
pocket
extracted
a
rouble
note
and
gave
it
to
madame
shtchukin
take
it
and
and
go
away
madame
shtchukin
wrapped
the
money
up
in
her
handkerchief
put
it
away
and
pursing
up
her
face
into
a
sweet
mincing
even
coquettish
smile
asked
your
excellency
and
would
it
be
possible
for
my
husband
to
get
a
post
again
i
am
going
i
am
ill
said
kistunov
in
a
weary
voice
i
have
dreadful
palpitations
when
he
had
driven
home
alexey
nikolaitch
sent
nikita
for
some
laurel
drops
and
after
taking
twenty
drops
each
all
the
clerks
set
to
work
while
madame
shtchukin
stayed
another
two
hours
in
the
vestibule
talking
to
the
porter
and
waiting
for
kistunov
to
return
she
came
again
next
day
an
enigmatic
nature
on
the
red

leading
paper
of
the
province
he
is
gazing
into
her
face
gazing
intently
with
the
eyes
of
a
connoisseur
he
is
watching
studying
catching
every
shade
of
this
exceptional
enigmatic
nature

understands
it

fathoms

whole
psychology

open
before

heart

my
father
was
a
poor
clerk
in
the

without
intelligence
but

spirit
of
the
age
of
his
environment
comprenez
i
do
not
blame
my
poor
father
he
drank
gambled
took
bribes
my
mother
but
why
say
more
poverty
the
struggle
for
daily
bread
the
consciousness
of
insignificance
ah
do
not
force
me
to
recall
it
i
had
to
make
my
own
way
you
know
the
monstrous
education
at
a
foolish
the
errors
of
early
youth
the
first
timid
flutter
of
love
it
was
awful
the
vacillation
and
the
agonies
of
losing
faith
in
life
in
oneself
ah
you
are
an
author
you
know
us
women

will
understand

intense
nature
i
looked
for
happiness
and
what
happiness
i
longed
to
set
my
soul
free

in
that
i
saw
my
happiness
exquisite
creature
murmured
the
author
kissing
her
hand
close
to

bracelet

his
kiss
oh
voldemar
i
longed
for
glory
renown
success
like
every
why
affect
modesty
every
nature
above
the
commonplace
i
yearned
for
something
extraordinary
above
the
common
lot
of
woman
and
then
and
then
there
crossed
my
path
an
old
general
very
well
off
understand
me
voldemar
it
was
renunciation
you
must
see
that
i
could
do
nothing
else
i
restored
the
family
fortunes
was
able
to
travel
to
do
good
yet
how
i
suffered
how
revolting
how
loathsome
to
me
were
his
embraces
though
i
will
be
fair
to
him
he
had
fought
nobly
in
his
day
there
were
moments
terrible
moments
but
i
was
kept
up
by
the
thought
that
from
day
to
day
the
old
man
might
die
that
then
i
would
begin
to
live
as
i
liked
to
give
myself
to
the
man
i
adore
be
happy
there
is
such
a
man
voldemar
indeed
there
is
the
pretty
lady
flutters
her
fan
more
violently
her
face
takes
a
lachrymose
expression
she
goes
on
but
at
last
the
old
man
died
he
left
me
something
i
was
free
as
a
bird
of
the
air
now
is
the
moment
for
me
to
be
happy
is
it
voldemar
happiness
comes
tapping
at
my
window
i
had
only
to
let
it
in
but
voldemar
listen
i
implore
you
now
is
the
time
for
me
to
give
myself
to
the
man
i
love
to
become
the
partner
of
his
life
to
help
to
uphold
his
ideals
to
be
happy
to
find
rest
but
how
ignoble
repulsive
and
senseless
all
our
life
is
how
mean
it
all
is
voldemar
i
am
wretched
wretched
wretched
again
there
is
an
obstacle
in
my
path
again
i
feel
that
my
happiness
is
far
far
away
ah
what
anguish
if
only
you
knew
what
anguish
but
what
what
stands
in
your
way
i
implore
you
tell
me
what
is
it
another
old
general
very
well
off
the
broken
fan
conceals
the
pretty
little
face
the
author
props
on
his
fist
his
brow
and
ponders
with
the
air
of
a
master
in
psychology
the
engine
is
whistling
and
hissing
while
the
window
curtains
flush
red
with
the
glow
of
the
setting
sun
a
happy
man
the
passenger
train
is
just
starting
from
bologoe
the
junction
on
the
line
in
a
smoking
compartment
five
passengers
sit
dozing
shrouded
in
the
twilight
of
the
carriage
they
had
just
had
a
meal
and
now
snugly
ensconced
in
their
seats
they
are
trying
to
go
to
sleep
stillness
the
door
opens
and
in
there
walks
a
tall
lanky
figure
straight
as
a
poker
with
a
hat
and
a
smart
overcoat
wonderfully
suggestive
of
a
journalist
in
jules
verne
or
on
the
comic
stage
the
figure
stands
still
in
the
middle
of
the
compartment
for
a
long
while
breathing
heavily
screwing
up
his
eyes
and
peering
at
the
seats
no
wrong
again
he
mutters
what
the
deuce
it
positively
revolting
no
the
wrong
one
again
one
of
the
passengers
stares
at
the
figure
and
utters
a
shout
of
joy
ivan
alexyevitch
what
brings
you
here
is
it
you
the
gentleman
starts
stares
blankly
at
the
passenger
and
recognizing
him
claps
his
hands
with
delight
ha
pyotr
petrovitch
he
says
how
many
summers
how
many
winters
i
did
know
you
were
in
this
train
how
are
you
getting
on
i
am
all
right

only
thing

my
dear
fellow
i
lost
my
compartment
and
i
simply
ca
find
it
what
an
idiot
i
am
i
ought
to
be
thrashed
the
gentleman
sways
a
little
unsteadily
and
sniggers
queer
things
do
happen
he
continues
i
stepped
out
just
after
the
second
bell
to
get
a
glass
of
brandy
i
got
it
of
course
well
i
thought
since
it
a
long
way
to
the
next
station
it
would
be
as
well
to
have
a
second
glass
while
i
was
thinking
about
it
and
drinking
it
the
third
bell
rang
i
ran
like
mad
and
jumped
into
the
first
carriage
i
am
an
idiot
i
am
the
son
of
a
hen
but
you
seem
in
very
good
spirits
observes
pyotr
petrovitch
come
and
sit
down
there

and
a
welcome
no

off
to
look
for
my
carriage

between
the
carriages

the
dark
if

down
and
when
we
get
to
a
station
you
find
your
own
compartment
sit
down
ivan
alexyevitch
heaves
a
sigh
and
irresolutely
sits
down
facing
pyotr
petrovitch
he
is
visibly
excited
and
fidgets
as
though
he
were
sitting
on
thorns
where
are
you
travelling
to
pyotr
petrovitch
enquires
i
into
space
there
is
such
a
turmoil
in
my
head
that
i
tell
where
i
am
going
myself
i
go
where
fate
takes
me
my
dear
fellow
have

seen
a
happy
fool
no
well
then

a
look
at

the
happiest
of
mortals

see
something
from
my
face
well
one

you
a
bit
a
tiny
bit
i
dare
say
i
look
awfully
stupid
just
now
ach
it
a
pity
i
have
a
i
should
like
to
look
at
my
my
dear
fellow
i
feel
i
am
turning
into
an
idiot
honour
bright
would
you
believe
it
i
on
my
honeymoon

i
not
the
son
of
a
hen
you
do
you
mean
to
say
you
are
married
my
dear
boy
we
came
away
straight
after
the
wedding
congratulations
and
the
usual
questions
follow
well
you
are
a
fellow
laughs
pyotr
petrovitch
that
why
you
are
rigged
out
such
a
dandy
yes
indeed
to
complete
the
illusion
i
even
sprinkled
myself
with
scent
i
am
over
my
ears
in
vanity
no
care
no
thought
nothing
but
a
sensation
of
something
or
other
deuce
knows
what
to
call
it
beatitude
or
something
i
never
felt
so
grand
in
my
life
ivan
alexyevitch
shuts
his
eyes
and
waggles
his
head
i
revoltingly
happy
he
says
just
think
in
a
minute
i
shall
go
to
my
compartment
there
on
the
seat
near
the
window
is
sitting
a
being
who
is
so
to
say
devoted
to
you
with
her
whole
being
a
little
blonde
with
a
little
nose
little
fingers
my
little
darling
my
angel
my
little
poppet
phylloxera
of
my
soul
and
her
little
foot
good
god
a
little
foot
not
like
our
but
something
miniature
fairylike
allegorical
i
could
pick
it
up
and
eat
it
that
little
foot
oh
but
you
understand
you
a
materialist
of
course
you
begin
analyzing
at
once
and
one
thing
and
another
you
are
bachelors
that
what
you
are
when
you
get
married
you
think
of
me
ivan
alexyevitch
now
you
say
yes
so
in
a
minute
going
to
my
compartment
there
she
is
waiting
for
me
with
impatience
in
joyful
anticipation
of
my
appearance
she
have
a
smile
to
greet
me
i
sit
down
beside
her
and
take
her
chin
with
my
two
fingers
ivan
alexyevitch
waggles
his
head
and
goes
off
into
a
chuckle
of
delight
then
i
lay
my
noddle
on
her
shoulder
and
put
my
arm
round
her
waist
around
all
is
silence
you
know
poetic
twilight
i
could
embrace
the
whole
world
at
such
a
moment
pyotr
petrovitch
allow
me
to
embrace
you
delighted
i
sure
the
two
friends
embrace
while
the
passengers
laugh
in
chorus
and
the
happy
bridegroom
continues
and
to
complete
the
idiocy
or
as
the
novelists
say
to
complete
the
illusion
one
goes
to
the
and
tosses
off
two
or
three
glasses
and
then
something
happens
in
your
head
and
your
heart
finer
than
you
can
read
of
in
a
fairy
tale
i
am
a
man
of
no
importance
but
i
feel
as
though
i
were
limitless
i
embrace
the
whole
world
the
passengers
looking
at
the
tipsy
and
blissful
bridegroom
are
infected
by
his
cheerfulness
and
no
longer
feel
sleepy
instead
of
one
listener
ivan
alexyevitch
has
now
an
audience
of
five
he
wriggles
and
splutters
gesticulates
and
prattles
on
without
ceasing
he
laughs
and
they
all
laugh
gentlemen
gentlemen
do
think
so
much
damn
all
this
analysis
if
you
want
a
drink
drink
no
need
to
philosophize
as
to
whether
it
bad
for
you
or
not
damn
all
this
philosophy
and
psychology
the
guard
walks
through
the
compartment
my
dear
fellow
the
bridegroom
addresses
him
when
you
pass
through
the
carriage
no
look
out
for
a
lady
in
a
grey
hat
with
a
white
bird
and
tell
her
i
here
yes
sir
only
there
is
a
no
in
this
train
there
well
then
it
all
the
same
tell
that
lady
then
that
her
husband
is
all
right
ivan
alexyevitch
suddenly
clutches
his
head
and
groans
husband
lady
all
in
a
minute
husband
i
am
a
puppy
that
needs
thrashing
and
here
i
am
a
husband
ach
idiot
but
think
of
her
yesterday
she
was
a
little
girl
a
midget
it
s
simply
incredible
nowadays
it
really
seems
strange
to
see
a
happy
man
observes
one
of
the
passengers
one
as
soon
expects
to
see
a
white
elephant
yes
and
whose
fault
is
it
says
ivan
alexyevitch
stretching
his
long
legs
and
thrusting
out
his
feet
with
their
very
pointed
toes
if
you
are
not
happy
it
your
own
fault
yes
what
else
do
you
suppose
it
is
man
is
the
creator
of
his
own
happiness
if
you
want
to
be
happy
you
will
be
but
you
do
want
to
be
you
obstinately
turn
away
from
happiness
why
what
next
how
do
you
make
that
out
very
simply
nature
has
ordained
that
at
a
certain
stage
in
his
life
man
should
love
when
that
time
comes
you
should
love
like
a
house
on
fire
but
you
wo
heed
the
dictates
of
nature
you
keep
waiting
for
something
what
more
it
laid
down
by
law
that
the
normal
man
should
enter
upon
matrimony
there
no
happiness
without
marriage
when
the
propitious
moment
has
come
get
married
no
use
in
but
you
do
get
married
you
keep
waiting
for
something
then
the
scriptures
tell
us
that
maketh
glad
the
heart
of
man
if
you
feel
happy
and
you
want
to
feel
better
still
then
go
to
the
refreshment
bar
and
have
a
drink
the
great
thing
is
not
to
be
too
clever
but
to
follow
the
beaten
track
the
beaten
track
is
a
grand
thing
you
say
that
man
is
the
creator
of
his
own
happiness
how
the
devil
is
he
the
creator
of
it
when
a
toothache
or
an
is
enough
to
scatter
his
happiness
to
the
winds
everything
depends
on
chance
if
we
had
an
accident
at
this
moment
you
sing
a
different
tune
stuff
and
nonsense
retorts
the
bridegroom
railway
accidents
only
happen
once
a
year
i
not
afraid
of
an
accident
for
there
is
no
reason
for
one
accidents
are
exceptional
confound
them
i
do
want
to
talk
of
them
oh
i
believe
we
stopping
at
a
station
where
are
you
going
now
asks
pyotr
petrovitch
to
moscow
or
somewhere
further
south
why
bless
you
how
could
i
go
somewhere
further
south
when
on
my
way
to
the
north
but
moscow
is
in
the
north
i
know
that
but
we
on
our
way

petersburg
says
ivan
alexyevitch
we
are
going
to
moscow
mercy
on
us
to
moscow
what
do
you
mean
says
the
bridegroom
in
amazement
it
queer
for
what
station
did
you
take
your
ticket
for
petersburg
in
that
case
i
congratulate
you
you
got
into
the
wrong
train
there
follows
a
minute
of
silence
the
bridegroom
gets
up
and
looks
blankly
round
the
company
yes
yes
pyotr
petrovitch
explains
you
must
have
jumped
into
the
wrong
train
at
bologoe
after
your
glass
of
brandy
you
succeeded
in
getting
into
the
ivan
alexyevitch
turns
pale
clutches
his
head
and
begins
pacing
rapidly
about
the
carriage
ach
idiot
that
i
am
he
says
in
indignation
scoundrel
the
devil
devour
me
whatever
am
i
to
do
now
why
my
wife
is
in
that
train
she
there
all
alone
expecting
me
consumed
by
anxiety
ach
i
a
motley
fool
the
bridegroom
falls
on
the
seat
and
writhes
as
though
someone
had
trodden
on
his
corns
i
am
man
he
moans
what
am
i
to
do
what
am
i
to
do
there
there
the
passengers
try
to
console
him
it
all
right
you
must
telegraph
to
your
wife
and
try
to
change
into
the
petersburg
express
in
that
way
you
overtake
her
the
petersburg
express
weeps
the
bridegroom
the
creator
of
his
own
happiness
and
how
am
i
to
get
a
ticket
for
the
petersburg
express
all
my
money
is
with
my
wife
the
passengers
laughing
and
whispering
together
make
a
collection
and
furnish
the
happy
man
with
funds
a
troublesome
visitor
in
the
crooked
little
hut
of
artyom
the
forester
two
men
were
sitting
under
the
big
dark
ikon
artyom
himself
a
short
and
lean
peasant
with
a
wrinkled
face
and
a
little
beard
that
grew
out
of
his
neck
and
a
young
man
in
a
new
crimson
shirt
and
big
wading
boots
who
had
been
out
hunting
and
come
in
for
the
night
they
were
sitting
on
a
bench
at
a
little
table
on
which
a
tallow
candle
stuck
into
a
bottle
was
lazily
burning
outside
the
window
the
darkness
of
the
night
was
full
of
the
noisy
uproar
into
which
nature
usually
breaks
out
before
a
thunderstorm
the
wind
howled
angrily
and
the
bowed
trees
moaned
miserably
one
pane
of
the

against

paper

a
hoarse
little
tenor

with
unblinking
eyes
at
the

bears
or
wild
beasts
of
any
sort
but
i
am
afraid
of

you
can
save
yourself
from
beasts
with
a
gun
or
some
other
weapon
but
you
have
no
means
of
saving
yourself
from
a
wicked
man
to
be
sure
you
can
fire
at
a
beast
but
if
you
shoot

will
have
to
answer

in
upon

of
figure

smash
me
with
his
little
finger

him
bread
and
he
gobbles
it
up
and
stretches
out
full
length
across
the
hut
with
not
a
word
of
thanks
and
there
are
some
that

for
money

month
and

bound

sell
timber
on
the
sly
artyom
took
a
timid
sideway
glance
at
his
visitor
and
twitched
his
beard
as
a
magpie
twitches
her
tail
you
are
still
young
to
say
a
thing
like
that
to
me
he
said

am
too
poor
to
keep
meat
or
anything
else
but
bread
you
are
welcome
to
at
that
moment
something
began
growling
under
the
bench
the
growl
was
followed
by
a
hiss
artyom
started
drew
up
his
legs
and
looked
enquiringly
at
the
hunter
it
my
dog
worrying
your
cat
said
the
hunter
you
devils
he
shouted
under
the
bench
lie
down
you
be
beaten
i
say
your
cat
thin
mate
she
is
nothing
but
skin
and
bone
she
is
old
it
is
time
she
was
dead
so
you
say
you
are
from
vyazovka
i
see
you
do
feed
her
though
she
a
cat
she
a
creature
every
breathing
thing
you
should
have
pity
on
her
you
are
a
queer
lot
in
vyazovka
artyom
went
on
as
though
not
listening
the
church
has
been
robbed
twice
in
one
year
to
think
that
there
are
such
wicked
men
so
they
fear
neither
man
nor
god
to
steal
what
is
the
lord
hanging
too
good
for
them
in
old
days
the
governors
used
to
have
such
rogues
flogged
however
you
punish
whether
it
is
with
flogging
or
anything
else
it
will
be
no
good
you
will
not
knock
the
wickedness
out
of
a
wicked
man
save
and
preserve
us
queen
of
heaven
the
forester
sighed
abruptly
save
us
from
all
enemies
and
evildoers
last
week
at
volovy
zaimishtchy
a
mower
struck
another
on
the
chest
with
his
scythe
he
killed
him
outright
and
what
was
it
all
about
god
bless
me
one
mower
came
out
of
the
tavern
drunk
the
other
met
him
drunk
too
the
young
man
who
had
been
listening
attentively
suddenly
started
and
his
face
grew
tense
as
he
listened
stay
he
said
interrupting
the
forester
i
fancy
someone
is
shouting
the
hunter
and
the
forester
fell
to
listening
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
window
through
the
noise
of
the
forest
they
could
hear
sounds
such
as
the
strained
ear
can
always
distinguish
in
every
storm
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
make
out
whether
people
were
calling
for
help
or
whether
the
wind
was
wailing
in
the
chimney
but
the
wind
tore
at
the
roof
tapped
at
the
paper
on
the
window
and
brought
a
distinct
shout
of
help
talk
of
your
murderers
said
the
hunter
turning
pale
and
getting
up
someone
is
being
robbed
lord
have
mercy
on
us
whispered
the
forester
and
he
too
turned
pale
and
got
up
the
hunter
looked
aimlessly
out
of
window
and
walked
up
and
down
the
hut
what
a
night
what
a
night
he
muttered
you
ca
see
your
hand
before
your
face
the
very
time
for
a
robbery
do
you
hear
there
is
a
shout
again
the
forester
looked
at
the
ikon
and
from
the
ikon
turned
his
eyes
upon
the
hunter
and
sank
on
to
the
bench
collapsing
like
a
man
terrified
by
sudden
bad
news
good
christian
he
said
in
a
tearful
voice
you
might
go
into
the
passage
and
bolt
the
door
and
we
must
put
out
the
light
what
for
by
they
may
find
their
way
here
oh
our
sins
we
ought
to
be
going
and
you
talk
of
bolting
the
door
you
are
a
clever
one
are
you
coming
the
hunter
threw
his
gun
over
his
shoulder
and
picked
up
his
cap
get
ready
take
your
gun
hey
flerka
here
he
called
to
his
dog
flerka
a
dog
with
long
frayed
ears
a
mongrel
between
a
setter
and
a
came
out
from
under
the
bench
he
stretched
himself
by
his
master
feet
and
wagged
his
tail
why
are
you
sitting
there
cried
the
hunter
to
the
forester
you
mean
to
say
you
are
not
going
where
to
help
how
can
i
said
the
forester
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
shuddering
all
over
i
ca
bother
about
it
why
wo
you
come
after
talking
of
such
dreadful
things
i
wo
stir
a
step
into
the
darkness
bless
them
and
what
should
i
go
for
what
are
you
afraid
of
have
you
got
a
gun
let
us
go
please
do
it
scaring
to
go
alone
it
will
be
more
cheerful
the
two
of
us
do
you
hear
there
was
a
shout
again
get
up
whatever
do
you
think
of
me
lad
wailed
the
forester
do
you
think
i
am
such
a
fool
to
go
straight
to
my
undoing
so
you
are
not
coming
the
forester
did
not
answer
the
dog
probably
hearing
a
human
cry
gave
a
plaintive
whine
are
you
coming
i
ask
you
cried
the
hunter
rolling
his
eyes
angrily
you
do
keep
on
upon
my
word
said
the
forester
with
annoyance
go
yourself
ugh
low
cur
growled
the
hunter
turning
towards
the
door
flerka
here
he
went
out
and
left
the
door
open
the
wind
flew
into
the
hut
the
flame
of
the
candle
flickered
uneasily
flared
up
and
went
out
as
he
bolted
the
door
after
the
hunter
the
forester
saw
the
puddles
in
the
track
the
nearest
and
the
retreating
figure
of
his
guest
lighted
up
by
a
flash
of
lightning
far
away
he
heard
the
rumble
of
thunder
holy
holy
holy
whispered
the
forester
making
haste
to
thrust
the
thick
bolt
into
the
great
iron
rings
what
weather
the
lord
has
sent
us
going
back
into
the
room
he
felt
his
way
to
the
stove
lay
down
and
covered
himself
from
head
to
foot
lying
under
the
sheepskin
and
listening
intently
he
could
no
longer
hear
the
human
cry
but
the
peals
of
thunder
kept
growing
louder
and
more
prolonged
he
could
hear
the
big
raindrops
pattering
angrily
on
the
panes
and
on
the
paper
of
the
window
he
gone
on
a
fool
errand
he
thought
picturing
the
hunter
soaked
with
rain
and
stumbling
over
the
i
bet
his
teeth
are
chattering
with
terror
not
more
than
ten
minutes
later
there
was
a
sound
of
footsteps
followed
by
a
loud
knock
at
the
door
who
there
cried
the
forester
it
i
he
heard
the
young
man
voice
unfasten
the
door
the
forester
clambered
down
from
the
stove
felt
for
the
candle
and
lighting
it
went
to
the
door
the
hunter
and
his
dog
were
drenched
to
the
skin
they
had
come
in
for
the
heaviest
of
the
downpour
and
now
the
water
ran
from
them
as
from
washed
clothes
before
they
have
been
wrung
out
what
was
it
asked
the
forester
a
peasant
woman
driving
in
a
cart
she
had
got
off
the
road
answered
the
young
man
struggling
with
his
breathlessness
she
was
caught
in
a
thicket
ah
the
silly
thing
she
was
frightened
then
well
did
you
put
her
on
the
road
i
do
care
to
talk
to
a
scoundrel
like
you
the
young
man
flung
his
wet
cap
on
the
bench
and
went
on
i
know
now
that
you
are
a
scoundrel
and
the
lowest
of
men
and
you
a
keeper
too
getting
a
salary
you
blackguard
the
forester
slunk
with
a
guilty
step
to
the
stove
cleared
his
throat
and
lay
down
the
young
man
sat
on
the
bench
thought
a
little
and
lay
down
on
it
full
length
not
long
afterwards
he
got
up
put
out
the
candle
and
lay
down
again
during
a
particularly
loud
clap
of
thunder
he
turned
over
spat
on
the
floor
and
growled
out
he
afraid
and
what
if
the
woman
were
being
murdered
whose
business
is
it
to
defend
her
and
he
an
old
man
too
and
a
christian
he
a
pig
and
nothing
else
the
forester
cleared
his
throat
and
heaved
a
deep
sigh
somewhere
in
the
darkness
flerka
shook
his
wet
coat
vigorously
which
sent
drops
of
water
flying
about
all
over
the
room
so
you
would
care
if
the
woman
were
murdered
the
hunter
went
on
well
strike
me
god
i
had
no
notion
you
were
that
sort
of
man
a
silence
followed
the
thunderstorm
was
by
now
over
and
the
thunder
came
from
far
away
but
it
was
still
raining
and
suppose
it
had
been
a
woman
but
you
shouting
said
the
hunter
breaking
the
silence
how
would
you
feel
you
beast
if
no
one
ran
to
your
aid
you
have
upset
me
with
your
meanness
plague
take
you
after
another
long
interval
the
hunter
said
you
must
have
money
to
be
afraid
of
people
a
man
who
is
poor
is
not
likely
to
be
afraid
for
those
words
you
will
answer
before
god
artyom
said
hoarsely
from
the
stove
i
have
no
money
i
dare
say
scoundrels
always
have
money
why
are
you
afraid
of
people
then
so
you
must
have
i
like
to
take
and
rob
you
for
spite
to
teach
you
a
lesson
artyom
slipped
noiselessly
from
the
stove
lighted
a
candle
and
sat
down
under
the
holy
image
he
was
pale
and
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
hunter
here
i
rob
you
said
the
hunter
getting
up
what
do
you
think
about
it
fellows
like
you
want
a
lesson

me
where
is
your
money
hidden
artyom
drew
his
legs
up
under
him
and
blinked
what
are
you
wriggling
for
where
is
your
money
hidden
have
you
lost
your
tongue
you
fool
why
do
you
answer
the
young
man
jumped
up
and
went
up
to
the
forester
he
is
blinking
like
an
owl
well
give
me
your
money
or
i
will
shoot
you
with
my
gun
why
do
you
keep
on
at
me
squealed
the
forester
and
big
tears
rolled
from
his
eyes
what
the
reason
of
it
god
sees
all
you
will
have
to
answer
for
every
word
you
say
to
god
you
have
no
right
whatever
to
ask
for
my
money
the
young
man
looked
at
artyom
tearful
face
frowned
and
walked
up
and
down
the
hut
then
angrily
clapped
his
cap
on
his
head
and
picked
up
his
gun
ugh
ugh
it
makes
me
sick
to
look
at
you
he
filtered
through
his
teeth
i
ca
bear
the
sight
of
you
i
wo
sleep
in
your
house
anyway
hey
flerka
the
door
slammed
and
the
troublesome
visitor
went
out
with
his
dog
artyom
bolted
the
door
after
him
crossed
himself
and
lay
down
an
actor
end
shtchiptsov
the
heavy
father
and
simpleton
a
tall
and
old
man
not
so
much
distinguished
by
his
talents
as
an
actor
as
by
his
exceptional
physical
strength
had
a
desperate
quarrel
with
the
manager
during
the
performance
and
just
when
the
storm
of
words
was
at
its
height
felt
as
though
something
had
snapped
in
his
chest
zhukov
the
manager
as
a
rule
began
at
the
end
of
every
heated
discussion
to
laugh
hysterically
and
to
fall
into
a
swoon
on
this
occasion
however
shtchiptsov
did
not
remain
for
this
climax
but
hurried
home
the
high
words
and
the
sensation
of
something
ruptured
in
his
chest
so
agitated
him
as
he
left
the
theatre
that
he
forgot
to
wash
off
his
paint
and
did
nothing
but
take
off
his
beard
when
he
reached
his
hotel
room
shtchiptsov
spent
a
long
time
pacing
up
and
down
then
sat
down
on
the
bed
propped
his
head
on
his
fists
and
sank
into
thought
he
sat
like
that
without
stirring
or
uttering
a
sound
till
two
the
next
afternoon
when
sigaev
the
comic
man
walked
into
his
room
why
is
it
you
did
not
come
to
the
rehearsal
booby
ivanitch
the
comic
man
began
panting
and
filling
the
room
with
fumes
of
vodka
where
have
you
been
shtchiptsov
made
no
answer
but
simply
stared
at
the
comic
man
with
lustreless
eyes
under
which
there
were
smudges
of
paint
you
might
at
least
have
washed
your
phiz
sigaev
went
on
you
are
a
disgraceful
sight
have
you
been
boozing
or
are
you
ill
or
what
but
why
do
you
speak
i
am
asking
you
are
you
ill
shtchiptsov
did
not
speak
in
spite
of
the
paint
on
his
face
the
comic
man
could
not
help
noticing
his
striking
pallor
the
drops
of
sweat
on
his
forehead
and
the
twitching
of
his
lips
his
hands
and
feet
were
trembling
too
and
the
whole
huge
figure
of
the
simpleton
looked
somehow
crushed
and
flattened
the
comic
man
took
a
rapid
glance
round
the
room
but
saw
neither
bottle
nor
flask
nor
any
other
suspicious
vessel
i
say
mishutka
you
know
you
are
ill
he
said
in
a
flutter
strike
me
dead
you
are
ill
you
do
look
yourself
shtchiptsov
remained
silent
and
stared
disconsolately
at
the
floor
you
must
have
caught
cold
said
sigaev
taking
him
by
the
hand
oh
dear
how
hot
your
hands
are
what
the
trouble
i
to
go
home
muttered
shtchiptsov
but
you
are
at
home
now
are
you
no
to
vyazma
oh
my
anywhere
else
it
would
take
you
three
years
to
get
to
your
vyazma

do

want
to
go
and
see
your
daddy
and

the
comic
man
fumbled
in
his
pockets
found
a
piece
and
ran
to
the
chemist
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
he
came
back

he
said
holding
the
bottle
to
the
heavy
father
mouth

straight
out
of
the
bottle
all
at
a
go
that
the
way
now
nibble
at
a
clove
that
your
very
soul
may
stink
of
the
filthy
stuff
the
comic
man
sat
a
little
longer
with
his
sick
friend
then
kissed
him
tenderly
and
went
away
towards
evening
the
ran
in
to
see
shtchiptsov
the
gifted
actor
was
wearing
a
pair
of
prunella
boots
had
a
glove
on
his
left
hand
was
smoking
a
cigar
and
even
smelt
of
heliotrope
yet
nevertheless
he
strongly
suggested
a
traveller
cast
away
in
some
land
in
which
there
were
neither
baths
nor
laundresses
nor
tailors
i
hear
you
are
ill
he
said
to
shtchiptsov
twirling
round
on
his
heel
what
wrong
with
you
what
wrong
with
you
really
shtchiptsov
did
not
speak
nor
stir
why
do
you
speak
do
you
feel
giddy
oh
well
do
talk
i
wo
pester
you
do
talk
that
was
his
stage
name
in
his
passport
he
was
called
guskov
walked
away
to
the
window
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
fell
to
gazing
into
the
street
before
his
eyes
stretched
an
immense
waste
bounded
by
a
grey
fence
beside
which
ran
a
perfect
forest
of
last
year
burdocks
beyond
the
waste
ground
was
a
dark
deserted
factory
with
windows
boarded
up
a
belated
jackdaw
was
flying
round
the
chimney
this
dreary
lifeless
scene
was
beginning
to
be
veiled
in
the
dusk
of
evening
i
must
go
home
the
heard
where
is
home
to
vyazma
to
my
home
it
is
a
thousand
miles
to
vyazma
my
boy
sighed
drumming
on
the
and
what
do
you
want
to
go
to
vyazma
for
i
want
to
die
there
what
next
now
he
dying
he
has
fallen
ill
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
and
already
he
fancies
that
his
last
hour
is
come
no
my
boy
no
cholera
will
carry
off
a
buffalo
like
you
live
to
be
a
hundred
where
the
pain
there
no
pain
but
i
feel
you
do
feel
anything
it
all
comes
from
being
too
healthy
your
surplus
energy
upsets
you
you
ought
to
get
jolly
tight
drink
you
know
till
your
whole
inside
is
getting
drunk
is
wonderfully
restoring
do
you
remember
how
screwed
you
were
at
rostov
on
the
don
good
lord
the
very
thought
of
it
is
alarming
sashka
and
i
together
could
only
just
carry
in
the
barrel
and
you
emptied
it
alone
and
even
sent
for
rum
afterwards
you
got
so
drunk
you
were
catching
devils
in
a
sack
and
pulled
a
up
by
the
roots
do
you
remember
then
you
went
off
to
beat
the
greeks
under
the
influence
of
these
agreeable
reminiscences
face
brightened
a
little
and
his
eyes
began
to
shine
and
do
you
remember
how
i
beat
savoikin
the
manager
he
muttered
raising
his
head
but
there
i
beaten
managers
in
my
time
and
i
ca
remember
how
many
smaller
fry
and
what
managers
they
were
men
who
would
not
permit
the
very
winds
to
touch
them
i
beaten
two
celebrated
authors
and
one
painter
what
are
you
crying
for
at
kherson
i
killed
a
horse
with
my
fists
and
at
taganrog
some
roughs
fell
upon
me
at
night
fifteen
of
them
i
took
off
their
caps
and
they
followed
me
begging
give
us
back
our
caps
that
how
i
used
to
go
on
what
are
you
crying
for
then
you
silly
but
now
it
all
over
i
feel
it
if
only
i
could
go
to
vyazma
a
pause
followed
after
a
silence
shtchiptsov
suddenly
jumped
up
and
seized
his
cap
he
looked
distraught
i
am
going
to
vyazma
he
articulated
staggering
and
the
money
for
the
journey
h
i
shall
go
on
foot
you
are
crazy
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
probably
because
the
same
thought
of
the
boundless
plains
the
unending
forests
and
swamps
struck
both
of
them
at
once
well
i
see
you
have
gone
off
your
head
the
commented
i
tell
you
what
old
man
first
thing
go
to
bed
then
drink
some
brandy
and
tea
to
put
you
into
a
sweat
and
some
of
course
stay
where
am
i
to
get
some
brandy
thought
a
minute
then
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
a
shopkeeper
called
madame
tsitrinnikov
to
try
and
get
it
from
her
on
tick
who
knows
perhaps
the
woman
would
feel
for
them
and
let
them
have
it
the
went
off
and
half
an
hour
later
returned
with
a
bottle
of
brandy
and
some
shtchiptsov
was
sitting
motionless
as
before
on
the
bed
gazing
dumbly
at
the
floor
he
drank
the
offered
him
by
his
friend
like
an
automaton
with
no
consciousness
of
what
he
was
doing
like
an
automaton
he
sat
afterwards
at
the
table
and
drank
tea
and
brandy
mechanically
he
emptied
the
whole
bottle
and
let
the
put
him
to
bed
the
latter
covered
him
up
with
a
quilt
and
an
overcoat
advised
him
to
get
into
a
perspiration
and
went
away
the
night
came
on
shtchiptsov
had
drunk
a
great
deal
of
brandy
but
he
did
not
sleep
he
lay
motionless
under
the
quilt
and
stared
at
the
dark
ceiling
then
seeing
the
moon
looking
in
at
the
window
he
turned
his
eyes
from
the
ceiling
towards
the
companion
of
the
earth
and
lay
so
with
open
eyes
till
the
morning
at
nine
in
the
morning
zhukov
the
manager
ran
in
what
has
put
it
into
your
head
to
be
ill
my
angel
he
cackled
wrinkling
up
his
nose
aie
aie
a
man
with
your
physique
has
no
business
to
be
ill
for
shame
for
shame
do
you
know
i
was
quite
frightened
our
conversation
have
had
such
an
effect
on
him
i
wondered
my
dear
soul
i
hope
it
not
through
me
you
fallen
ill
you
know
you
gave
me
as
good
er
and
besides
comrades
can
never
get
on
without
words
you
called
me
all
sorts
of
names
and
have
gone
at
me
with
your
fists
too
and
yet
i
am
fond
of
you
upon
my
soul
i
am
i
respect
you
and
am
fond
of
you
explain
my
angel
why
i
am
so
fond
of
you
you
are
neither
kith
nor
kin
nor
wife
but
as
soon
as
i
heard
you
had
fallen
ill
it
cut
me
to
the
heart
zhukov
spent
a
long
time
declaring
his
affection
then
fell
to
kissing
the
invalid
and
finally
was
so
overcome
by
his
feelings
that
he
began
laughing
hysterically
and
was
even
meaning
to
fall
into
a
swoon
but
probably
remembering
that
he
was
not
at
home
nor
at
the
theatre
put
off
the
swoon
to
a
more
convenient
opportunity
and
went
away
soon
after
him
adabashev
the
tragic
actor
a
dingy
individual
who
talked
through
his
nose
made
his
appearance
for
a
long
while
he
looked
at
shtchiptsov
for
a
long
while
he
pondered
and
at
last
he
made
a
discovery
do
you
know
what
mifa
he
said
pronouncing
through
his
nose
f
instead
of
sh
and
assuming
a
mysterious
expression
do
you
know
what
you
ought
to
have
a
dose
of
shtchiptsov
was
silent
he
remained
silent
too
a
little
later
as
the
tragic
actor
poured
the
loathsome
oil
into
his
mouth
two
hours
later
yevlampy
or
as
the
actors
for
some
reason
called
him
rigoletto
the
hairdresser
of
the
company
came
into
the
room
he
too
like
the
tragic
man
stared
at
shtchiptsov
for
a
long
time
then
sighed
like
a
and
slowly
and
deliberately
began
untying
a
parcel
he
had
brought
with
him
in
it
there
were
twenty
cups
and
several
little
flasks
you
should
have
sent
for
me
and
i
would
have
cupped
you
long
ago
he
said
tenderly
baring
shtchiptsov
chest
it
is
easy
to
neglect
illness
thereupon
rigoletto
stroked
the
broad
chest
of
the
heavy
father
and
covered
it
all
over
with
suction
cups
yes
he
said
as
after
this
operation
he
packed
up
his
paraphernalia
crimson
with
shtchiptsov
blood
you
should
have
sent
for
me
and
i
would
have
come
you
need
trouble
about
payment
i
do
it
from
sympathy
where
are
you
to
get
the
money
if
that
idol
wo
pay
you
now
please
take
these
drops
they
are
nice
drops
and
now
you
must
have
a
dose
of
this
the
real
thing
that
right
i
hope
it
will
do
you
good
well
now
rigoletto
took
his
parcel
and
withdrew
pleased
that
he
had
been
of
assistance
to
a
the
next
morning
sigaev
the
comic
man
going
in
to
see
shtchiptsov
found
him
in
a
terrible
condition
he
was
lying
under
his
coat
breathing
in
gasps
while
his
eyes
strayed
over
the
ceiling
in
his
hands
he
was
crushing
convulsively
the
crumpled
quilt
to
vyazma
he
whispered
when
he
saw
the
comic
man
to
vyazma
come
i
do
like
that
old
man
said
the
comic
man
flinging
up
his
hands
you
see
you
see
you
see
old
man
not
the
thing
excuse
me
but
it
positively
stupid
to
go
to
vyazma
my
god
to
vyazma
i
i
did
not
expect
it
of
you
the
comic
man
muttered
utterly
distracted
what
the
deuce
do
you
want
to
collapse
like
this
for
aie
aie
aie
that
not
the
thing
a
giant
as
tall
as
a
and
crying
is
it
the
thing
for
actors
to
cry
no
wife
nor
children
muttered
shtchiptsov
i
ought
not
to
have
gone
for
an
actor
but
have
stayed
at
vyazma
my
life
has
been
wasted
semyon
oh
to
be
in
vyazma
aie
aie
aie
that
not
the
thing
you
see
stupid
contemptible
indeed
recovering
his
composure
and
setting
his
feelings
in
order
sigaev
began
comforting
shtchiptsov
telling
him
untruly
that
his
comrades
had
decided
to
send
him
to
the
crimea
at
their
expense
and
so
on
but
the
sick
man
did
not
listen
and
kept
muttering
about
vyazma
at
last
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
the
comic
man
began
talking
about
vyazma
himself
to
comfort
the
invalid
it
a
fine
town
he
said
soothingly
a
capital
town
old
man
it
famous
for
its
cakes
the
cakes
are
classical
but
between
ourselves
h
they
are
a
bit
groggy
for
a
whole
week
after
eating
them
i
was
h
but
what
is
fine
there
is
the
merchants
they
are
something
like
merchants
when
they
treat
you
they
do
treat
you
the
comic
man
talked
while
shtchiptsov
listened
in
silence
and
nodded
his
head
approvingly
towards
evening
he
died
