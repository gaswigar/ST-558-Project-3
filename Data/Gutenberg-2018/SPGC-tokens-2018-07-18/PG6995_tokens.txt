there
fearful
to

sat
this

grinning
at

the
friendly
spectre
stood
by
me
he
fled
madly
through
the
wainscoting
of
the
room
then
he
set
about
telling
me
of
the
beautiful
gold
and
silver
ware
they
use
in
the
elysian
fields
there
was
no

him
to

dare
look
me
in

at
your
story
and
see
it
was
to
be
the
effort
of
his
life

he
rose
up

morning
he
would
find
every

ghosts
that
have
haunted
me
a
few
spirit
reminiscences
if
we
could
only
get
used
to
the
idea
that
ghosts
are
perfectly
harmless
creatures
who
are
powerless
to
affect
our
unless
we
assist
them
by
giving
way
to
our
fears
we
should
enjoy
the
supernatural
exceedingly
it
seems
to
me
coleridge
i
think
it
was
was
once
asked
by
a
lady
if
he
believed
in
ghosts
and
he
replied
no
madame
i
have
seen
too
many
of
them
which
is
my
case
exactly
i
have
seen
so
many
horrid
visitants
from
other
worlds
that
they
hardly
affect
me
at
all
so
far
as
the
mere
inspiration
of
terror
is
concerned
on
the
other
hand
they
interest
me
hugely
and
while
i
must
admit
that
i
do
experience
all
the
purely
physical
sensations
that
come
from
horrific
encounters
of
this
nature
i
can
truly
add
in
my
own
behalf
that
mentally
i
can
rise
above
the
physical
impulse
to
run
away
and
invariably
standing
my
ground
i
have
gained
much
useful
information
concerning
them
i
am
prepared
to
assert
that
if
a
thing
with
flashing
green
eyes
and
clammy
hands
and
long
dripping
strips
of
in
place
of
hair
should
rise
up
out
of
the
floor
before
me
at
this
moment
and
nobody
in
the
house
but
myself
with
a
fearful
storm
raging
outside
i
should
without
hesitation
ask
it
to
sit
down
and
light
a
cigar
and
state
its
business
or
if
it
were
of
the
female
persuasion
to
join
me
in
a
bottle
of
sarsaparilla
although
every
physical
manifestation
of
fear
of
which
my
poor
body
is
capable
would
be
present
i
have
had
experiences
in
this
line
which
if
i
could
get
you
to
believe
them
would
convince
you
that
i
speak
the
truth
knowing
weak
suspicious
human
nature
as
i
do
however
i
do
not
hope
ever
to
convince
you
though
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
on
one
occasion
in
the
spring
of
there
was
a
spiritual
manifestation
in
my
library
which
nearly
prostrated
me
physically
but
which
mentally
i
hugely
enjoyed
because
i
was
mentally
strong
enough
to
subdue
my
physical
repugnance
for
the
thing
which
suddenly
and
without
any
apparent
reason
materialized
in
my
i
going
to
tell
you
about
it
briefly
though
i
warn
you
in
advance
that
you
will
find
it
a
great
strain
upon
your
confidence
in
my
veracity
it
may
even
shatter
that
confidence
beyond
repair
but
i
can
not
help
that
i
hold
that
it
is
a
man
duty
in
this
life
to
give
to
the
world
the
benefit
of
his
experience
all
that
he
sees
he
should
set
down
exactly
as
he
sees
it
and
so
simply
withal
that
to
the
dullest
comprehension
the
moral
involved
shall
be
perfectly
obvious
if
he
is
a
painter
and
an
maiden
appears
to
him
to
have
blue
hair
he
should
paint
her
hair
blue
and
just
so
long
as
he
sticks
by
his
principles
and
is
true
to
himself
he
need
not
bother
about
what
you
may
think
of
him
so
it
is
with
me
my
scheme
of
living
is
based
upon
being
true
to
myself
you
may
class
me
with
baron
munchausen
if
you
choose
i
shall
not
mind
so
long
as
i
have
the
consolation
of
feeling
deep
down
in
my
heart
that
i
am
a
true
realist
and
diverge
not
from
the
paths
of
truth
as
truth
manifests
itself
to
me
this
intruder
of
whom
i
was
just
speaking
the
one
that
took
possession
of
my
in
the
spring
of
was
about
as
horrible
a
spectre
as
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
to
have
haunt
me
it
was
worse
than
grotesque
it
grated
on
every
nerve
alongside
of
it
the
ordinary
poster
of
the
present
day
would
seem
to
be
as
accurate
in
drawing
as
a
bicycle
map
and
in
its
coloring
it
simply
shrieked
with
discord
if
color
had
tones
which
struck
the
ear
instead
of
appealing
to
the
eye
the
thing
would
have
deafened
me
it
was
about
midnight
when
the
manifestation
first
took
shape
my
family
had
long
before
retired
and
i
had
just
finished
smoking
a
cigar
which
was
one
of
a
thousand
which
my
wife
had
bought
for
me
at
a
monday
sale
at
one
of
the
big
department
stores
in
new
york
i
do
remember
the
brand
but
that
is
just
as
well
it
was
not
a
cigar
to
be
advertised
in
a
civilized
piece
of
literature
but
i
do
remember
that
they
came
in
bundles
of
fifty
tied
about
with
blue
ribbon
the
one
i
had
been
smoking
tasted
and
burned
as
if
it
had
been
rolled
by
a
cuban
insurrectionist
while
fleeing
from
a
spanish
regiment
through
a
morass
gathering
its
component
parts
as
he
ran
it
had
two
distinct
merits
however
no
man
could
possibly
smoke
too
many
of
them
and
they
were
economical
which
is
how
the
little
madame
came
to
get
them
for
me
and
i
have
no
doubt
they
will
some
day
prove
very
useful
in
removing
insects
from
the
they
cost
a
thousand
on
five
days
a
week
but
at
the
monday
sale
they
were
marked
down
to
which
is
why
my
wife
to
whom
i
had
recently
read
a
little
lecture
on
economy
purchased
them
for
me
upon
the
evening
in
question
i
had
been
at
work
on
this
cigar
for
about
two
hours
and
had
smoked
one
side
of
it
of
the
way
down
to
the
end
when
i
concluded
that
i
had
smoked
enough
for
one
day
so
i
rose
up
to
cast
the
other
side
into
the
fire
which
was
flickering
fitfully
in
my
spacious
fireplace
this
done
i
turned
about
and
there
fearful
to
see
sat
this
thing
grinning
at
me
from
the
depths
of
my
chair
my
hair
not
only
stood
on
end
but
tugged
madly
in
an
effort
to
get
away
four
hairs
i
can
prove
the
statement
if
it
be
desired
did
pull
themselves
loose
from
my
scalp
in
their
insane
desire
to
rise
above
the
terrors
of
the
situation
and
flying
upward
stuck
like
nails
into
the
oak
ceiling
directly
over
my
head
whence
they
had
to
be
pulled
the
next
morning
with
nippers
by
our
hired
man
who
would
no
doubt
testify
to
the
truth
of
the
occurrence
as
i
have
asserted
it
if
he
were
still
living
which
unfortunately
he
is
not
like
most
hired
men
he
was
subject
to
attacks
of
lethargy
from
one
of
which
he
died
last
summer
he
sank
into
a
rest
about
last
june
and
lingered
quietly
along
for
two
months
and
after
several
futile
efforts
to
wake
him
up
we
finally
disposed
of
him
to
our
town
crematory
for
experimental
purposes
i
am
told
he
burned
very
actively
and
i
believe
it
for
to
my
certain
knowledge
he
was
very
dry
and
not
so
green
as
some
persons
who
had
previously
employed
him
affected
to
think
a
cold
chill
came
over
me
as
my
eye
rested
upon
the
horrid
visitor
and
noted
the
greenish
depths
of
his
eyes
and
the
formation
of
his
fingers
and
my
flesh
began
to
creep
like
an
at
one
time
i
was
conscious
of
eight
separate
corrugations
on
my
back
and
my
arms
until
they
looked
like
one
of
those
miniature
plaster
casts
of
the
alps
which
are
so
popular
in
swiss
summer
resorts
but
mentally
i
was
not
disturbed
at
all
my
repugnance
was
entirely
physical
and
to
come
to
the
point
at
once
i
calmly
offered
the
spectre
a
cigar
which
it
accepted
and
demanded
a
light
i
gave
it
nonchalantly
lighting
the
match
upon
the
goose
of
my
wrist
illustration
i
turned
about
and
there
fearful
to
see
sat
this
thing
grinning
at
me
now
i
admit
that
this
was
extraordinary
and
hardly
credible
yet
it
happened
exactly
as
i
have
set
it
down
and
furthermore
i
enjoyed
the
experience
for
three
hours
the
thing
and
i
conversed
and
not
once
during
that
time
did
my
hair
stop
pulling
away
at
my
scalp
or
the
repugnance
cease
to
run
in
great
rolling
waves
up
and
down
my
back
if
i
wished
to
deceive
you
i
might
add
that
began
to
grow
from
the
but
that
would
be
a
lie
and
lying
and
i
are
not
friends
and
furthermore
this
paper
is
not
written
to
amaze
but
to
instruct
except
for
its
personal
appearance
this
particular
ghost
was
not
very
remarkable
and
i
do
not
at
this
time
recall
any
of
the
details
of
our
conversation
beyond
the
point
that
my
share
of
it
was
not
particularly
coherent
because
of
the
discomfort
attendant
upon
the
fearful
process
i
was
going
through
i
merely
cite
its
coming
to
prove
that
with
all
the
outward
visible
signs
of
fear
manifesting
themselves
in
no
uncertain
manner
mentally
i
was
cool
enough
to
cope
with
the
visitant
and
sufficiently
calm
and
at
ease
to
light
the
match
upon
my
wrist
perceiving
for
the
first
time
with
an
ingenuity
one
of
the
uses
to
which
might
be
put
and
knowing
full
well
that
if
i
tried
to
light
it
on
the
sole
of
my
shoe
i
should
have
fallen
to
the
ground
my
knees
being
too
shaky
to
admit
of
my
standing
on
one
leg
even
for
an
instant
had
i
been
mentally
overcome
i
should
have
tried
to
light
the
match
on
my
foot
and
fallen
ignominiously
to
the
floor
then
and
there
there
was
another
ghost
that
i
recall
to
prove
my
point
who
was
of
very
great
use
to
me
in
the
summer
immediately
following
the
spring
of
which
i
have
just
told
you
you
will
possibly
remember
how
that
the
summer
of
had
rather
more
than
its
fair
share
of
heat
and
that
the
lovely
new
jersey
town
in
which
i
have
the
happiness
to
dwell
appeared
to
be
the
headquarters
of
the
temperature
the
thermometers
of
the
nation
really
seemed
to
take
orders
from
beachdale
and
properly
enough
for
our
town
is
a
born
leader
in
respect
to
heat
having
no
property
to
sell
i
candidly
admit
that
beachdale
is
not
of
an
arctic
nature
in
summer
except
socially
perhaps
socially
it
is
the
coolest
town
in
the
state
but
we
are
at
this
moment
not
discussing
cordiality
fraternal
love
or
the
question
raised
by
the
declaration
of
independence
as
to
whether
all
men
are
born
equal
the
warmth
we
have
in
hand
is
what
the
old
lady
called
fahrenheat
and
from
a
thermometric
point
of
view
beachdale
if
i
may
be
a
trifle
slangy
as
i
sometimes
am
has
heat
to
burn
there
are
mitigations
of
this
heat
it
is
true
but
they
generally
come
along
in
winter
i
must
claim
in
behalf
of
my
town
that
never
in
all
my
experience
have
i
known
a
summer
so
hot
that
it
was
not
sooner
or
later
by
january
anyhow
followed
by
a
cool
spell
but
in
the
summer
of
even
the
agents
confessed
that
the
cold
wave
announced
by
the
weather
bureau
at
washington
summered
elsewhere
in
the
tropics
perhaps
but
not
at
beachdale
one
hardly
dared
take
a
bath
in
the
morning
for
fear
of
being
scalded
by
the
fluid
that
flowed
from
the
faucet
our
reservoir
is
entirely
unprotected
by
and
in
summer
a
favorite
spot
for
young
waltons
who
like
to
catch
bass
already
boiled
my
neighbors
and
myself
lived
on
cracked
ice
and
destructive
cold
drinks
i
do
not
myself
mind
hot
weather
in
the
daytime
but
hot
nights
are
killing
i
sleep
i
toss
about
for
hours
and
then
for
the
sake
of
variety
i
flop
but
sleep
cometh
not
my
debts
double
and
my
income
seems
to
sizzle
away
under
the
influence
of
a
hot
sleepless
night
and
it
was
just
here
that
a
certain
awful
thing
saved
me
from
the
insanity
which
is
a
certain
result
of
parboiled
insomnia
it
was
about
the
of
july
which
as
i
remember
reading
in
an
extra
edition
of
the
got
out
to
mention
the
fact
was
the
hottest
of
july
known
in
years
i
had
retired
at
seven
after
dining
lightly
upon
a
cold
salmon
and
a
gallon
of
iced
tea
not
because
i
was
tired
but
because
i
wanted
to
get
down
to
first
principles
at
once
and
remove
my
clothing
and
sort
of
spread
myself
over
all
the
territory
i
could
which
is
a
thing
you
ca
do
in
a
library
or
even
in
a
parlor
if
man
were
constructed
like
a
machine
as
he
really
ought
to
be
to
be
strictly
comfortable
a
machine
that
could
be
taken
apart
like
an
clock
i
should
have
taken
myself
apart
putting
one
section
of
myself
on
the
roof
another
part
in
the
spare
room
hanging
a
third
on
the
in
the
yard
and
so
on
leaving
my
head
in
the
but
unfortunately
we
have
to
keep
ourselves
together
in
this
life
hence
i
did
the
only
thing
one
can
do
and
retired
and
incidentally
spread
myself
over
some
freshly
baked
bedclothing
there
was
some
relief
from
the
heat
but
not
much
i
had
been
roasting
and
while
my
sensations
were
somewhat
like
those
which
i
imagine
come
to
a
planked
shad
when
he
first
finds
himself
spread
out
over
the
plank
there
was
a
mitigation
my
temperature
fell
off
from
to
about
which
is
not
quite
enough
to
make
a
man
absolutely
content
suddenly
however
i
began
to
shiver
there
was
no
breeze
but
i
began
to
shiver
it
is
getting
cooler
i
thought
as
the
chill
came
on
and
i
rose
and
looked
at
the
thermometer
it
still
registered
the
highest
possible
point
and
the
mercury
was
rebelliously
trying
to
break
through
the
top
of
the
glass
tube
and
take
a
stroll
on
the
roof
that
queer
i
said
to
myself
it
as
hot
as
ever
and
yet
shivering
i
wonder
if
my
goose
is
cooked
i
certainly
got
a
chill
i
jumped
back
into
bed
and
pulled
the
sheet
up
over
me
but
still
i
shivered
then
i
pulled
the
blanket
up
but
the
chill
continued
i
could
seem
to
get
warm
again
then
came
the
counterpane
and
finally
i
had
to
put
on
my
a
fuzzy
woollen
affair
which
in
midwinter
i
had
sometimes
found
too
warm
for
comfort
even
then
i
was
not
sufficiently
bundled
up
so
i
called
for
an
extra
blanket
two
afghans
and
the
bag
everybody
in
the
house
thought
i
had
gone
mad
and
i
wondered
myself
if
perhaps
i
had
when
all
of
a
sudden
i
perceived
off
in
the
corner
the
awful
thing
and
perceiving
it
i
knew
all
i
was
being
haunted
and
the
physical
repugnance
of
which
i
have
spoken
was
on
the
cold
shiver
the
invariable
accompaniment
of
the
ghostly
visitant
had
come
and
i
assure
you
i
never
was
so
glad
of
anything
in
my
life
it
has
always
been
said
of
me
by
my
critics
that
i
am
raw
i
was
afraid
that
after
that
night
they
would
say
i
was
half
baked
and
i
would
far
rather
be
the
one
than
the
other
and
it
was
the
awful
thing
that
saved
me
realizing
this
i
spoke
to
it
gratefully
you
are
a
gift
on
a
night
like
this
said
i
rising
up
and
walking
to
its
side
i
am
glad
to
be
of
service
to
you
the
awful
thing
replied
smiling
at
me
so
yellowly
that
i
almost
wished
the
author
of
the
of
could
have
seen
it
it
very
good
of
you
i
put
in
not
at
all
replied
the
thing
you
are
the
only
man
i
know
who
does
think
it
necessary
to
prevaricate
about
ghosts
every
time
he
gets
an
order
for
a
christmas
story
there
have
been
more
lies
told
about
us
than
about
any
other
class
of
things
in
existence
and
we
are
getting
a
trifle
tired
of
it
we
may
have
lost
our
corporeal
existence
but
some
of
our
sensitiveness
still
remains
well
said
i
rising
and
lighting
the
for
i
was
on
the
very
verge
of
congealment
i
am
sure
i
am
pleased
if
you
like
my
stories
oh
as
for
that
i
do
think
much
of
them
said
the
awful
thing
with
a
purple
display
of
candor
which
amused
me
although
i
can
not
say
that
i
relished
it
but
you
never
lie
about
us
you
are
not
at
all
interesting
but
you
are
truthful
and
we
spooks
hate
libellers
just
because
one
happens
to
be
a
thing
is
no
reason
why
writers
should
libel
it
and
that
why
i
have
always
respected
you
we
regard
you
as
a
sort
of
spook
boswell
you
may
be
dull
and
stupid
but
you
tell
the
truth
and
when
i
saw
you
in
imminent
danger
of
becoming
a
mere
grease
spot
owing
to
the
fearful
heat
i
decided
to
help
you
through
that
why
i
here
go
to
sleep
now
i
stay
here
and
keep
you
shivering
until
daylight
anyhow
i
stay
longer
but
we
are
always
laid
at
sunrise
like
an
egg
i
said
sleepily
tutt
said
the
ghost
go
to
sleep
if
you
talk
i
have
to
go
and
so
i
dropped
off
to
sleep
as
softly
and
as
sweetly
as
a
tired
child
in
the
morning
i
awoke
refreshed
the
rest
of
my
family
were
prostrated
but
i
was
fresh
the
awful
thing
was
gone
and
the
room
was
warming
up
again
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
tinkling
ice
in
my
i
should
have
suspected
it
was
all
a
dream
and
so
throughout
the
whole
sizzling
summer
the
friendly
spectre
stood
by
me
and
kept
me
cool
and
i
have
a
doubt
that
it
was
because
of
his
good
offices
in
keeping
me
shivering
on
those
fearful
august
nights
that
i
survived
the
season
and
came
to
my
work
in
the
autumn
as
fit
as
a
fiddle
so
fit
indeed
that
i
have
not
written
a
poem
since
that
has
not
struck
me
as
being
the
very
best
of
its
kind
and
if
i
can
find
a
publisher
who
will
take
the
risk
of
putting
those
poems
out
i
shall
unequivocally
and
without
hesitation
acknowledge
as
i
do
here
my
debt
of
gratitude
to
my
friends
in
the
spirit
world
manifestations
of
this
nature
then
are
harmful
as
i
have
already
observed
only
when
the
person
who
is
haunted
yields
to
his
physical
impulses
fought
stubbornly
inch
by
inch
with
the
will
they
can
be
subdued
and
often
they
are
a
boon
i
think
i
have
proved
both
these
points
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
discover
the
facts
however
and
my
discovery
came
about
in
this
way
it
may
perhaps
interest
you
to
know
how
i
made
it
i
encountered
at
the
english
home
of
a
wealthy
friend
at
one
time
a
presence
of
an
insulting
turn
of
mind
it
was
at
my
friend
jarley
little
baronial
hall
which
he
had
rented
from
the
earl
of
brokedale
the
year
jarley
was
presented
at
court
the
countess
of
brokedale
social
influence
went
with
the
château
for
a
slightly
increased
rental
which
was
why
the
jarleys
took
it
i
was
invited
to
spend
a
month
with
them
not
so
much
because
jarley
is
fond
of
me
as
because
jarley
had
a
sort
of
an
idea
that
as
a
writer
i
might
say
something
about
their
newly
acquired
glory
in
some
american
sunday
newspaper
and
jarley
laughingly
assigned
to
me
the
haunted
chamber
without
at
least
one
of
which
no
baronial
hall
in
the
old
country
is
considered
worthy
of
the
name
illustration
friendly
spectre
stood
by
me
it
will
interest
you
more
than
any
other
jarley
said
and
if
it
has
a
ghost
i
imagine
you
will
be
able
to
subdue
him
i
gladly
accepted
the
hospitality
of
my
friend
and
was
delighted
at
his
consideration
in
giving
me
the
haunted
chamber
where
i
might
pursue
my
investigations
into
the
subject
of
phantoms
undisturbed
deserting
london
then
for
a
time
i
ran
down
to
brokedale
hall
and
took
up
my
abode
there
with
a
other
guests
jarley
as
usual
since
his
sudden
as
wilkins
called
it
did
everything
with
a
lavish
hand
i
believe
a
man
could
have
got
diamonds
on
toast
if
he
had
chosen
to
ask
for
them
however
this
is
apart
from
my
story
i
had
occupied
the
haunted
chamber
about
two
weeks
before
anything
of
importance
occurred
and
then
it
came
and
a
more
unpleasant
spook
never
floated
in
the
ether
he
materialized
about
and
was
unpleasantly
sulphurous
to
one
perceptions
he
sat
upon
the
divan
in
my
room
holding
his
knees
in
his
hands
leering
and
scowling
upon
me
as
though
i
were
the
intruder
and
not
he
who
are
you
i
asked
excitedly
as
in
the
dying
light
of
the
log
fire
he
loomed
grimly
up
before
me
none
of
your
business
he
replied
insolently
showing
his
teeth
as
he
spoke
on
the
other
hand
who
are
you
this
is
my
room
and
not
yours
and
it
is
i
who
have
the
right
to
question
if
you
have
any
business
here
well
and
good
if
not
you
will
oblige
me
by
removing
yourself
for
your
presence
is
offensive
to
me
i
am
a
guest
in
the
house
i
answered
restraining
my
impulse
to
throw
the
inkstand
at
him
for
his
impudence
and
this
room
has
been
set
apart
for
my
use
by
my
host
one
of
the
servant
guests
i
presume
he
said
insultingly
his
lividly
lip
upcurling
into
a
haughty
sneer
which
was
maddening
to
a
worm
like
myself
i
rose
up
from
my
bed
and
picked
up
the
poker
to
bat
him
over
the
head
but
again
i
restrained
myself
it
will
not
do
to
quarrel
i
thought
i
will
be
courteous
if
he
is
not
thus
giving
a
dead
englishman
a
lesson
which
would
hurt
some
of
the
living
no
i
said
my
voice
tremulous
with
wrath
no
i
am
the
guest
of
my
friend
jarley
an
american
who
same
thing
observed
the
intruder
with
a
yellow
sneer
race
of
animals
those
americans
only
fit
for
stables
you
know
this
was
too
much
a
ghost
may
insult
me
with
impunity
but
when
he
tackles
my
people
he
must
look
out
for
himself
i
sprang
forward
with
an
ejaculation
of
wrath
and
with
all
my
strength
struck
at
him
with
the
poker
which
i
still
held
in
my
hand
if
he
had
been
anything
but
a
ghost
he
would
have
been
split
vertically
from
top
to
toe
but
as
it
was
the
poker
passed
harmlessly
through
his
misty
and
rent
a
great
gash
two
feet
long
in
jarley
divan
the
yellow
sneer
faded
from
his
lips
and
a
maddening
blue
smile
took
its
place
humph
he
observed
nonchalantly
what
a
useless
ebullition
and
what
a
vulgar
display
of
temper
really
you
are
the
most
humorous
insect
i
have
yet
encountered
from
what
part
of
the
states
do
you
come
i
am
truly
interested
to
know
in
what
kind
of
soil
exotics
of
your
peculiar
kind
are
cultivated
are
you
part
of
the
fauna
or
the
flora
of
your
tropical
states
or
what
and
then
i
realized
the
truth
there
is
no
physical
method
of
combating
a
ghost
which
can
result
in
his
discomfiture
so
i
resolved
to
try
the
intellectual
it
was
a
contest
and
he
was
easy
prey
after
i
got
going
i
joined
him
in
his
blue
smile
and
began
to
talk
about
the
english
aristocracy
for
i
doubted
not
from
the
spectre
manner
that
he
was
or
had
been
one
of
that
class
he
had
about
him
that
haughty
lack
of
manners
which
bespoke
the
aristocrat
i
waxed
very
eloquent
when
as
i
say
i
got
my
mind
really
going
i
spoke
of
kings
and
queens
and
their
uses
in
no
uncertain
phrases
of
divine
right
of
dukes
earls
marquises
of
all
the
pompous
establishments
of
british
royalty
and
nobility
with
that
contemptuously
humorous
tolerance
of
a
necessary
and
somewhat
amusing
evil
which
we
find
in
american
comic
papers
we
had
a
battle
royal
for
about
one
hour
and
i
must
confess
he
was
a
foeman
worthy
of
any
man
steel
so
long
as
i
was
reasonable
in
my
arguments
but
when
i
finally
observed
that
it
would
be
ten
years
before
barnum
and
bailey
greatest
show
on
earth
had
the
whole
lot
engaged
for
the
new
york
circus
season
stalking
about
the
madison
square
garden
arena
with
the
prince
of
wales
at
the
head
beating
a
tomtom
he
grew
iridescent
with
wrath
and
fled
madly
through
the
wainscoting
of
the
room
it
was
purely
a
mental
victory
all
the
physical
possibilities
of
my
being
would
have
exhausted
themselves
futilely
before
him
but
when
i
turned
upon
him
the
resources
of
my
fancy
my
imagination
unrestrained
and
held
back
by
no
sense
of
responsibility
he
was
as
a
child
in
my
hands
obstreperous
but
certain
to
be
subdued
if
it
were
not
for
jarley
wrath
which
i
admit
she
tried
to
conceal
over
the
damage
to
her
divan
i
should
now
look
back
upon
that
visitation
as
the
most
agreeable
haunting
experience
of
my
life
at
any
rate
it
was
at
that
time
that
i
first
learned
how
to
handle
ghosts
and
since
that
time
i
have
been
able
to
overcome
them
without
trouble
save
in
one
instance
with
which
i
shall
close
this
chapter
of
my
reminiscences
and
which
i
give
only
to
prove
the
necessity
of
observing
strictly
one
point
in
dealing
with
spectres
illustration
he
fled
madly
through
the
wainscoting
of
the
room
it
happened
last
christmas
in
my
own
home
i
had
provided
as
a
little
surprise
for
my
wife
a
complete
new
solid
silver
service
marked
with
her
initials
the
tree
had
been
prepared
for
the
children
and
all
had
retired
save
myself
i
had
lingered
later
than
the
others
to
put
the
silver
service
under
the
tree
where
its
happy
recipient
would
find
it
when
she
went
to
the
tree
with
the
little
ones
the
next
morning
it
made
a
magnificent
display
the
two
dozen
of
each
kind
of
spoon
the
forks
the
knives
the
water
and
all
the
salvers
the
and
other
dazzling
attributes
of
a
complete
service
not
to
go
into
details
presented
a
fairly
scintillating
picture
which
would
have
made
me
gasp
if
i
had
not
at
the
moment
when
my
own
breath
began
to
catch
heard
another
gasp
in
the
corner
immediately
behind
me
turning
about
quickly
to
see
whence
it
came
i
observed
a
dark
figure
in
the
pale
light
of
the
moon
which
streamed
in
through
the
window
who
are
you
i
cried
starting
back
the
physical
symptoms
of
a
ghostly
presence
manifesting
themselves
as
usual
i
am
the
ghost
of
one
long
gone
before
was
the
reply
in
sepulchral
tones
i
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
for
i
had
for
a
moment
feared
it
was
a
burglar
oh
i
said
you
gave
me
a
start
at
first
i
was
afraid
you
were
a
material
thing
come
to
rob
me
then
turning
towards
the
tree
i
observed
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
fine
lay
out
eh
beautiful
he
said
hollowly
yet
not
so
beautiful
as
things
seen
in
realms
beyond
your
ken
and
then
he
set
about
telling
me
of
the
beautiful
gold
and
silver
ware
they
used
in
the
elysian
fields
and
i
must
confess
monte
cristo
would
have
had
a
hard
time
with
sindbad
the
sailor
to
help
to
surpass
the
picture
of
royal
magnificence
the
spectre
drew
i
stood
inthralled
until
even
as
he
was
talking
the
clock
struck
three
when
he
rose
up
and
moving
slowly
across
the
floor
barely
visible
murmured
regretfully
that
he
must
be
off
with
which
he
faded
away
down
the
back
stairs
i
pulled
my
nerves
which
were
getting
rather
strained
together
again
and
went
to
bed
illustration
then
he
sat
about
telling
me
of
the
beautiful
gold
and
silver
ware
they
use
in
the
elysian
fields
morning
every
bit
of
that
was
and
what
is
more
three
weeks
later
i
found
the
ghost
picture
in
the
gallery
in
new
york
as
that
of
the
cleverest
in
the
country
all
of
which
let
me
say
to
you
dear
reader
in
conclusion
proves
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
ghosts
you
must
give
up
all
your
physical
resources
until
you
have
definitely
ascertained
that
the
thing
by
which
you
are
confronted
horrid
or
otherwise
is
a
ghost
and
not
an
all
too
material
rogue
with
a
light
step
and
a
commodious
jute
bag
for
plunder
concealed
beneath
his
coat
how
to
tell
a
ghost
you
ask
well
as
an
eminent
master
of
fiction
frequently
observes
in
his
writings
that
is
another
story
which
i
shall
hope
some
day
to
tell
for
your
instruction
and
my
own
aggrandizement
the
mystery
of
my
grandmother
hair
sofa
it
happened
last
christmas
eve
and
precisely
as
i
am
about
to
set
it
forth
it
has
been
said
by
critics
that
i
am
a
romancer
of
the
wildest
sort
but
that
is
where
my
critics
are
wrong
i
grant
that
the
experiences
through
which
i
have
passed
some
of
which
have
contributed
to
the
gray
matter
in
my
hair
however
little
they
may
have
augmented
that
within
my
cranium
experiences
which
i
have
from
time
to
time
set
forth
to
the
best
of
my
poor
abilities
in
the
columns
of
such
periodicals
as
i
have
at
my
mercy
have
been
of
an
order
so
excessively
supernatural
as
to
give
my
critics
a
basis
for
their
aspersions
but
they
do
not
know
as
i
do
that
that
basis
is
as
uncertain
as
the
shifting
sands
of
the
sea
inasmuch
as
in
the
setting
forth
of
these
episodes
i
have
narrated
them
as
faithfully
as
the
most
conscientious
realist
could
wish
and
am
therefore
myself
a
true
and
faithful
follower
of
the
realistic
school
i
can
not
be
blamed
because
these
things
happen
to
me
if
i
sat
down
in
my
study
to
imagine
the
strange
incidents
to
which
i
have
in
the
past
called
attention
with
no
other
object
in
view
than
to
make
my
readers
unwilling
to
retire
for
the
night
to
destroy
the
peace
of
mind
of
those
who
are
good
enough
to
purchase
my
literary
wares
or
to
titillate
till
tense
the
nerve
tissue
of
the
timid
who
come
to
smile
and
who
depart
unstrung
then
should
i
deserve
the
severest
condemnation
but
these
things
i
do
not
do
i
have
a
mission
in
life
which
i
hold
as
sacred
as
my
good
friend
howells
holds
his
such
phases
of
life
as
i
see
i
put
down
faithfully
and
if
the
fates
in
their
wisdom
have
chosen
to
make
of
me
the
balzac
of
the
supernatural
the
shakespeare
of
the
midnight
visitation
while
elevating
howells
to
the
high
office
of
the
fielding
of
massachusetts
and
its
adjacent
states
the
smollett
of
boston
and
the
sterne
of
altruria
i
can
only
regret
that
the
powers
have
dealt
more
graciously
with
him
than
with
me
and
walk
my
little
way
as
gracefully
as
i
know
how
the
slings
and
arrows
of
outrageous
fortune
i
am
prepared
to
suffer
in
all
meekness
of
spirit
i
accept
them
because
it
seems
to
me
to
be
nobler
in
the
mind
so
to
do
rather
than
by
opposing
to
end
them
and
so
to
my
story
i
have
prefaced
it
at
such
length
for
but
one
reason
and
that
is
that
i
am
aware
that
there
will
be
those
who
will
doubt
the
veracity
of
my
tale
and
i
am
anxious
at
the
outset
to
impress
upon
all
the
unquestioned
fact
that
what
i
am
about
to
tell
is
the
plain
unvarnished
truth
and
as
i
have
already
said
it
happened
last
christmas
eve
i
regret
to
have
to
say
so
for
it
sounds
so
much
like
the
description
given
to
other
christmas
eves
by
writers
with
a
less
conscientious
regard
for
the
truth
than
i
possess
but
the
facts
must
be
told
and
i
must
therefore
state
that
it
was
a
wild
and
stormy
night
the
winds
howled
and
moaned
and
made
all
sorts
of
curious
noises
soughing
through
the
bare
limbs
of
the
trees
whistling
through
the
chimneys
and
with
reckless
disregard
of
my
children
need
of
rest
slamming
doors
until
my
house
seemed
to
be
the
centre
of
a
bombardment
of
no
mean
order
it
is
also
necessary
to
state
that
the
snow
which
had
been
falling
all
day
had
clothed
the
lawns
and
in
a
dazzling
drapery
of
white
and
not
content
with
having
done
this
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
was
still
falling
and
happily
enough
as
silently
as
usual
were
i
the
wild
romancer
that
i
have
been
called
i
might
have
had
the
snow
fall
with
a
thunderous
roar
but
i
can
not
go
to
any
such
length
i
love
my
but
there
is
a
limit
to
my
philanthropy
and
i
shall
not
have
my
snow
fall
noisily
just
to
make
a
critic
happy
i
might
do
it
to
save
his
life
for
i
should
hate
to
have
a
man
die
for
the
want
of
what
i
could
give
him
with
a
stroke
of
my
pen
and
without
any
special
effort
but
until
that
emergency
arises
i
shall
not
yield
a
jot
in
the
manner
of
the
falling
of
my
snow
occasionally
a
belated
would
pass
my
house
the
sleigh
strung
about
the
ample
proportions
of
his
steed
jingling
loud
above
the
roaring
of
the
winds
my
family
had
retired
and
i
sat
alone
in
the
glow
of
the
blazing
log
a
very
satisfactory
gas
affair
on
the
hearth
the
flashing
jet
flames
cast
the
usual
grotesque
shadows
about
the
room
and
my
mind
had
thereby
been
reduced
to
that
sensitive
state
which
had
hitherto
betokened
the
coming
of
a
visitor
from
other
realms
a
fact
which
i
greatly
regretted
for
i
was
in
no
mood
to
be
haunted
my
first
impulse
when
i
recognized
the
of
that
mental
state
which
is
evidenced
by
the
goosing
of
one
flesh
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
expression
was
to
turn
out
the
fire
and
go
to
bed
i
have
always
found
this
the
easiest
method
of
ridding
myself
of
unwelcome
ghosts
and
conversely
i
have
observed
that
others
who
have
been
haunted
unpleasantly
have
suffered
in
proportion
to
their
failure
to
take
what
has
always
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
most
natural
course
in
the
world
to
hide
their
heads
beneath
the
brutus
when
caesar
ghost
appeared
beside
his
couch
before
the
battle
of
philippi
sat
up
and
stared
upon
the
horrid
apparition
and
suffered
correspondingly
when
it
would
have
been
much
easier
and
more
natural
to
put
his
head
under
his
pillow
and
so
shut
out
the
unpleasant
spectacle
that
is
the
course
i
have
invariably
pursued
and
it
has
never
failed
me
the
most
luminous
ghost
man
ever
saw
is
utterly
powerless
to
shine
through
a
comfortably
stuffed
pillow
or
the
usual
quota
of
woollen
blankets
but
upon
this
occasion
i
preferred
to
await
developments
the
real
truth
is
that
i
was
about
written
out
in
the
matter
of
visitations
and
needed
a
reinforcement
of
my
uncanny
vein
which
far
from
being
varicose
had
become
sclerotic
so
dry
had
it
been
pumped
by
the
demands
to
which
it
had
been
subjected
by
a
clamorous
public
i
had
i
may
as
well
confess
it
run
out
of
ghosts
and
had
come
down
to
the
writing
of
tales
full
of
the
horror
of
suggestion
leaving
my
readers
unsatisfied
through
my
failure
to
describe
in
detail
just
what
kind
of
looking
thing
it
was
that
had
so
aroused
their
apprehension
and
one
editor
had
gone
so
far
as
to
reject
my
last
because
i
had
worked
him
up
to
a
fearful
pitch
of
excitement
and
left
him
there
without
any
reasonable
way
out
i
was
face
to
face
with
a
condition
which
briefly
was
that
hereafter
that
desirable
market
was
closed
to
the
products
of
my
pen
unless
my
contributions
were
accompanied
by
a
diagram
which
should
make
my
mysteries
so
plain
that
a
little
child
could
understand
how
it
all
came
to
pass
hence
it
was
that
instead
of
following
my
own
convenience
and
taking
refuge
in
my
couch
i
stayed
where
i
was
i
had
not
long
to
wait
the
dial
in
my
had
hardly
had
time
to
register
the
consumption
of
three
thousand
feet
of
gas
before
the
faint
sound
of
a
bell
reached
my
straining
ears
which
is
an
expression
i
profoundly
hate
but
must
introduce
because
the
public
demands
it
and
a
ghost
without
straining
ears
having
therefore
no
chance
of
acceptance
by
a
discriminating
editor
i
started
from
my
chair
and
listened
intently
but
the
ringing
had
stopped
and
i
settled
back
to
the
delights
of
a
nervous
chill
when
again
the
deathly
silence
of
the
night
the
wind
had
quieted
in
time
to
allow
me
the
use
of
this
faithful
overworked
phrase
was
broken
by
the
tintinnabulation
of
the
bell
this
time
i
recognized
it
as
the
electric
bell
operated
by
a
upon
the
right
side
of
my
front
door
to
rise
and
rush
to
the
door
was
the
work
of
a
moment
it
always
is
in
another
instant
i
had
flung
it
wide
this
operation
was
singularly
easy
considering
that
it
was
but
a
narrow
door
and
width
was
the
last
thing
it
could
ever
be
suspected
of
however
forcible
the
fling
however
i
did
as
i
have
said
and
gazed
out
into
the
inky
blackness
of
the
night
as
i
had
suspected
there
was
no
one
there
and
i
was
at
once
convinced
that
the
dreaded
moment
had
come
i
was
certain
that
at
the
instant
of
my
turning
to
my
library
i
should
see
something
which
would
make
my
brain
throb
madly
and
my
pulses
start
i
did
not
therefore
instantly
turn
but
let
the
wind
blow
the
door
to
with
a
loud
clatter
while
i
walked
quickly
into
my
dining
and
drained
a
glass
of
to
the
dregs
i
do
not
introduce
the
here
for
the
purpose
of
eliciting
a
laugh
from
the
reader
but
in
order
to
be
faithful
to
life
as
we
live
it
all
our
other
sherry
had
been
used
by
the
queen
of
the
kitchen
for
cooking
purposes
and
this
was
all
we
had
left
for
the
table
it
is
always
so
in
real
life
let
critics
say
what
they
will
illustration
there
was
no
one
there
this
done
i
returned
to
the
library
and
sustained
my
first
shock
the
unexpected
had
happened
there
was
still
no
one
there
surely
this
ghost
was
an
original
and
i
began
to
be
interested
perhaps
he
is
a
modest
ghost
i
thought
and
is
a
little
shy
about
manifesting
his
presence
that
indeed
would
be
original
seeing
how
bold
the
spectres
of
commerce
usually
are
intruding
themselves
always
upon
the
privacy
of
those
who
are
not
at
all
minded
to
receive
them
confident
that
something
would
happen
and
speedily
at
that
i
sat
down
to
wait
lighting
a
cigar
for
company
for
burning
are
not
as
sociable
as
their
hissing
spluttering
originals
the
genuine
logs
in
a
state
of
ignition
several
times
i
started
up
nervously
feeling
as
if
there
was
something
standing
behind
me
about
to
place
a
clammy
hand
upon
my
shoulder
and
as
many
times
did
i
resume
my
attitude
of
comfort
disappointed
once
i
seemed
to
see
a
minute
spirit
floating
in
the
air
before
me
but
investigation
showed
that
it
was
nothing
more
than
the
fanciful
curling
of
the
clouds
of
smoke
i
had
blown
from
my
lips
an
hour
passed
and
nothing
occurred
save
that
my
heart
from
throbbing
took
to
leaping
in
a
fashion
which
filled
me
with
concern
a
few
minutes
later
however
i
heard
a
strange
sound
at
the
window
and
my
leaping
heart
stood
still
the
strain
upon
my
tense
nerves
was
becoming
unbearable
illustration
i
drained
a
glass
of
cooking
sherry
to
the
dregs
at
last
i
whispered
to
myself
hoarsely
drawing
a
deep
breath
and
pushing
with
all
my
force
into
the
soft
upholstered
back
of
my
chair
then
i
leaned
forward
and
watched
the
window
momentarily
expecting
to
see
it
raised
by
unseen
hands
but
it
never
budged
then
i
watched
the
glass
anxiously
half
hoping
half
fearing
to
see
something
pass
through
it
but
nothing
came
and
i
began
to
get
irritable
i
looked
at
my
watch
and
saw
that
it
was
one
hang
you
i
cried
whatever
you
are
why
do
you
appear
and
be
done
with
it
the
idea
of
keeping
a
man
up
until
this
hour
of
the
night
then
i
listened
for
a
reply
but
there
was
none
what
do
you
take
me
for
i
continued
querulously
do
you
suppose
i
have
nothing
else
to
do
but
to
wait
upon
your
majesty
pleasure
surely
with
all
the
time
you
taken
to
make
your
début
you
must
be
something
of
unusual
horror
again
there
was
no
answer
and
i
decided
that
petulance
was
of
no
avail
some
other
tack
was
necessary
and
i
decided
to
appeal
to
his
sympathies
granting
that
ghosts
have
sympathies
to
appeal
to
and
i
have
met
some
who
were
so
human
in
this
respect
that
i
have
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
they
were
truly
ghosts
i
say
old
chap
i
said
as
genially
as
i
could
considering
the
situation
i
was
nervous
and
the
amount
of
gas
consumed
by
the
logs
was
beginning
to
bring
up
visions
of
bankruptcy
before
my
eyes
hurry
up
and
begin
your
haunting
there
a
good
fellow
i
a
father
please
remember
that
and
this
is
christmas
eve
the
children
will
be
up
in
about
three
hours
and
if
you
ever
been
a
parent
yourself
you
know
what
that
means
i
must
have
some
rest
so
come
along
and
show
yourself
like
the
good
spectre
you
are
and
let
me
go
to
bed
i
think
myself
it
was
a
very
moving
address
but
it
helped
me
not
a
jot
the
thing
must
have
had
a
heart
of
stone
for
it
never
made
answer
what
said
i
pretending
to
think
it
had
spoken
and
i
had
not
heard
distinctly
but
the
visitant
was
not
to
be
caught
napping
even
though
i
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
he
had
fallen
asleep
he
she
or
it
whatever
it
was
maintained
a
silence
as
deep
as
it
was
aggravating
i
smoked
furiously
on
to
restrain
my
growing
wrath
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
thing
might
have
some
pride
and
i
resolved
to
work
on
that
of
course
i
should
like
to
write
you
up
i
said
with
a
sly
wink
at
myself
i
imagine
you
attract
a
good
deal
of
attention
in
the
literary
world
judging
from
the
time
it
takes
you
to
get
ready
you
ought
to
make
a
good
magazine
story
not
one
of
those
comic
ghost
that
can
be
dashed
off
in
a
minute
and
ultimately
get
published
in
a
book
at
the
author
expense
you
stir
so
little
that
as
things
go
by
contraries
you
make
a
stirring
tale
you
long
enough
i
might
say
for
a
novel
but
ah
i
ca
do
you
unless
i
see
you
you
must
be
seen
to
be
appreciated
i
ca
imagine
you
you
know
let
see
now
if
i
can
guess
what
kind
of
a
ghost
you
are
um
you
must
be
terrifying
in
the
extreme
you
make
a
man
shiver
in
in
your
eyes
are
unfathomably
green
your
smile
would
drive
the
sanest
mad
your
hands
are
cold
and
clammy
as
a
ah
as
a
bag
four
hours
after
and
so
i
went
on
for
ten
minutes
praising
him
up
to
the
skies
and
ending
up
with
a
pathetic
appeal
that
he
should
manifest
his
presence
it
may
be
that
i
puffed
him
up
so
that
he
burst
but
however
that
may
be
he
would
not
condescend
to
reply
and
i
grew
angry
in
earnest
very
well
i
said
savagely
jumping
up
from
my
chair
and
turning
off
the
do
nobody
asked
you
to
come
in
the
first
place
and
nobody
going
to
complain
if
you
sulk
in
your
tent
like
achilles
i
do
want
to
see
you
i
could
fake
up
a
better
ghost
than
you
are
anyhow
in
fact
i
fancy
that
what
the
matter
with
you
you
know
what
a
miserable
specimen
you
are
could
frighten
a
mouse
if
you
were
ten
times
as
horrible
you
ashamed
to
show
yourself
and
i
do
blame
you
i
be
that
way
too
if
i
were
you
i
walked
to
the
door
momentarily
expecting
to
have
him
call
me
back
but
he
did
i
had
to
give
him
a
parting
shot
you
probably
belong
to
a
ghost
union
do
you
that
your
secret
ordered
out
on
strike
and
wo
do
any
haunting
after
sundown
unless
some
other
employer
of
unskilled
ghosts
pays
his
spooks
skilled
wages
i
had
half
a
notion
that
the
word
spook
would
draw
him
out
for
i
have
noticed
that
ghosts
do
not
like
to
be
called
spooks
any
more
than
negroes
like
to
be
called
niggers
they
consider
it
vulgar
he
never
yielded
in
his
reserve
however
and
after
locking
up
i
went
to
bed
for
a
time
i
could
not
sleep
and
i
began
to
wonder
if
i
had
been
just
after
all
possibly
there
was
no
spirit
within
miles
of
me
the
symptoms
were
all
there
but
might
not
that
have
been
due
to
my
depressed
condition
for
it
does
depress
a
writer
to
have
one
of
his
best
veins
become
sclerotic
i
asked
myself
and
finally
as
i
went
off
to
sleep
i
concluded
that
i
had
been
in
the
wrong
all
through
and
had
imagined
there
was
something
there
when
there
really
was
not
very
likely
the
ringing
of
the
bell
was
due
to
the
wind
i
said
as
i
dozed
off
of
course
it
would
take
a
very
heavy
wind
to
blow
the
button
in
but
then
and
then
i
fell
asleep
convinced
that
no
ghost
had
ventured
within
a
mile
of
me
that
night
but
when
morning
came
i
was
undeceived
something
must
have
visited
us
that
christmas
eve
and
something
very
terrible
for
while
i
was
dressing
for
breakfast
i
heard
my
wife
calling
loudly
from
below
illustration
it
had
turned
white
henry
she
cried
please
come
down
here
at
once
i
ca
i
only
half
shaved
i
answered
never
mind
that
she
returned
come
at
once
so
with
the
lather
on
one
cheek
and
a
cut
on
the
other
i
went
below
what
the
matter
i
asked
look
at
that
she
said
pointing
to
my
grandmother
which
stood
in
the
hall
just
outside
of
my
library
door
it
had
been
black
when
we
last
saw
it
but
as
i
looked
i
saw
that
a
great
change
had
come
over
it
had
turned
white
in
a
single
night
now
i
ca
account
for
this
strange
incident
nor
can
any
one
else
and
i
do
not
intend
to
try
it
is
too
awful
a
mystery
for
me
to
attempt
to
penetrate
but
the
sofa
is
there
in
proof
of
all
that
i
have
said
concerning
it
and
any
one
who
desires
can
call
and
see
it
at
any
time
it
is
not
necessary
for
them
to
see
me
they
need
only
ask
to
see
the
sofa
and
it
will
be
shown
we
have
had
it
removed
from
the
hall
to
the
parlor
for
we
can
not
bear
to
have
it
stand
in
any
of
the
rooms
we
use
the
mystery
of
barney
a
very
irritating
thing
has
happened
my
hired
man
a
certain
barney
an
american
citizen
of
much
political
influence
a
good
gardener
and
according
to
his
lights
a
gentleman
has
got
very
much
the
best
of
me
and
all
because
of
certain
effusions
which
from
time
to
time
have
emanated
from
my
pen
it
is
not
often
that
literary
chickens
come
home
to
roost
in
such
a
vengeful
fashion
as
some
of
mine
have
recently
done
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
as
this
story
progresses
he
who
reads
will
find
much
sympathy
for
me
rising
up
in
his
breast
as
the
matter
stands
i
am
torn
with
conflicting
emotions
i
am
very
fond
of
barney
and
i
have
always
found
him
truthful
hitherto
but
exactly
what
to
believe
now
i
hardly
know
the
main
thing
to
bring
my
present
trouble
upon
me
i
am
forced
to
believe
is
the
fact
that
my
house
has
been
in
the
past
and
may
possibly
still
be
haunted
why
my
house
should
be
haunted
at
all
i
do
not
know
for
it
has
never
been
the
scene
of
any
tragedy
that
i
am
aware
of
i
built
it
myself
and
it
is
paid
for
so
far
as
i
am
aware
nothing
awful
of
a
material
nature
has
ever
happened
within
its
walls
and
yet
it
appears
to
be
for
the
present
at
any
rate
a
sort
of
for
inconsiderate
if
not
strictly
horrid
things
which
is
a
most
unfair
dispensation
of
the
fates
for
i
have
not
deserved
it
if
i
were
in
any
sense
a
bluebeard
and
spent
my
days
cutting
ladies
throats
as
a
pastime
if
i
had
a
pleasing
habit
of
inviting
friends
up
from
town
over
sunday
and
dropping
them
into
oubliettes
connecting
my
library
with
dark
dank
and
snaky
subterranean
dungeons
if
guests
who
dine
at
my
house
came
with
a
feeling
that
the
chances
were
they
would
never
return
to
their
families
alive
it
might
be
different
i
should
and
blame
a
house
for
being
haunted
if
it
were
the
of
a
bloodthirsty
ruffian
such
as
i
have
indicated
but
that
is
just
what
it
is
not
it
is
not
the
home
of
a
lover
of
fearful
crimes
i
would
not
walk
ten
feet
for
the
pleasure
of
killing
any
man
no
matter
who
he
is
on
the
contrary
i
would
walk
twenty
feet
to
avoid
doing
it
if
the
emergency
should
ever
arise
aye
even
if
it
were
that
fiend
who
sits
next
me
at
the
opera
and
hums
the
opera
through
from
beginning
to
end
there
have
been
times
i
must
confess
when
i
have
wished
i
might
have
had
the
oubliettes
to
which
i
have
referred
constructed
beneath
my
library
and
leading
to
the
or
to
some
well
but
that
was
two
or
three
years
ago
when
i
was
in
politics
for
a
brief
period
and
delegations
of
willing
and
thirsty
voters
were
daily
and
nightly
swarming
in
through
every
one
of
the
sixteen
doors
on
the
of
my
house
which
my
architect
in
a
riotous
moment
smuggled
into
the
plans
in
the
guise
of
french
windows
i
should
have
minded
then
if
the
earth
had
opened
up
and
swallowed
my
whole
party
so
long
as
i
did
not
have
to
go
with
them
but
under
such
provocation
as
i
had
i
do
not
feel
that
my
residence
is
justified
in
being
haunted
after
its
present
fashion
because
such
a
notion
entered
my
mind
we
can
not
help
our
thoughts
much
less
our
notions
and
punishment
for
that
which
we
can
not
help
is
not
in
strict
accord
with
ideas
of
justice
it
may
occur
to
some
hypercritical
person
to
suggest
that
the
english
language
has
frequently
been
murdered
in
my
den
and
that
it
is
its
horrid
corse
which
is
playing
havoc
at
my
home
crying
out
to
heaven
and
flaunting
its
bloody
wounds
in
the
face
of
my
conscience
but
i
can
pass
such
an
aspersion
as
that
by
with
contemptuous
silence
for
even
if
it
were
true
it
could
not
be
set
down
as
wilful
assassination
on
my
part
since
no
sane
person
who
needs
a
language
as
much
as
i
do
would
ever
in
cold
blood
kill
any
one
of
the
many
that
lie
about
us
furthermore
the
english
language
is
not
dead
it
may
not
be
met
with
often
in
these
days
but
it
is
still
encountered
with
sufficient
frequency
in
the
works
of
henry
james
and
miss
libby
to
prove
that
it
still
lives
and
i
am
told
that
one
or
two
members
of
our
consular
service
abroad
can
speak
it
though
as
for
this
i
can
not
write
with
certainty
for
i
have
never
encountered
one
of
these
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
illustration
it
is
not
often
that
one
literary
chickens
come
home
to
roost
the
episode
with
which
this
narrative
has
to
deal
is
interesting
in
some
ways
though
i
doubt
not
some
readers
will
prove
sceptical
as
to
its
realism
there
are
suspicious
minds
in
the
world
and
with
these
every
man
who
writes
of
truth
must
reckon
to
such
i
have
only
to
say
that
it
is
my
desire
and
intention
to
tell
the
truth
as
simply
as
it
can
be
told
by
james
and
as
truthfully
as
sylvanus
cobb
ever
wrote
now
then
the
facts
of
my
story
are
these
in
the
latter
part
of
last
july
expecting
a
meeting
of
friends
at
my
house
in
connection
with
a
question
of
the
good
government
of
the
city
in
which
i
honestly
try
to
pay
my
taxes
i
ordered
one
hundred
cigars
to
be
delivered
at
my
residence
i
ordered
several
other
things
at
the
same
time
but
they
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
this
story
because
they
were
all
every
single
bottle
of
them
consumed
at
the
meeting
but
of
the
cigars
about
which
the
strange
facts
of
my
story
cluster
at
the
close
of
the
meeting
a
goodly
two
dozen
remained
this
is
surprising
considering
that
there
were
quite
six
of
us
present
but
it
is
true
by
actual
count
remained
when
the
last
guest
left
me
the
next
morning
i
and
my
family
took
our
departure
for
a
month
rest
in
the
mountains
in
the
hurry
of
leaving
home
and
the
worry
of
looking
after
three
children
and
four
times
as
many
trunks
i
neglected
to
include
the
cigars
in
my
impedimenta
leaving
them
in
the
opened
box
upon
my
library
table
it
was
careless
of
me
no
doubt
but
it
was
an
important
incident
as
the
sequel
shows
the
incidents
of
the
stay
in
the
hills
were
commonplace
but
during
my
absence
from
home
strange
things
were
going
on
there
as
i
learned
upon
my
return
the
place
had
been
left
in
charge
of
barney
who
upon
my
arrival
assured
me
that
everything
was
all
right
and
i
thanked
and
paid
him
wait
a
minute
barney
i
said
as
he
turned
to
leave
me
i
got
a
cigar
for
you
i
may
mention
incidentally
that
in
the
past
i
had
kept
barney
on
very
good
terms
with
his
work
by
treating
him
in
a
friendly
sociable
way
but
to
my
great
surprise
upon
this
occasion
he
declined
advances
his
face
flushed
very
red
as
he
observed
that
he
had
given
up
smoking
well
wait
a
minute
anyhow
said
i
there
are
one
or
two
things
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
and
i
went
to
the
table
to
get
a
cigar
for
myself
box
was
empty
instantly
the
suspicion
which
has
doubtless
flashed
through
the
mind
of
the
reader
flashed
through
my
own
barney
had
been
tempted
and
had
fallen
i
recalled
his
blush
and
on
the
moment
realized
that
in
all
my
vast
experience
with
hired
men
in
the
past
i
had
never
seen
one
blush
before
the
case
was
clear
my
cigars
had
gone
to
help
barney
through
the
hot
summer
well
i
declare
i
cried
turning
suddenly
upon
him
i
left
a
lot
of
cigars
here
when
i
went
away
barney
i
know
ye
did
sorr
said
barney
who
had
now
grown
white
and
rigid
i
saw
them
meself
sorr
there
was
of
you
counted
them
eh
i
asked
with
an
elevation
of
my
eyebrows
which
to
those
who
know
me
conveys
the
idea
of
suspicion
i
did
sorr
in
your
absence
i
was
responsible
for
here
and
the
mornin
ye
wint
awaa
i
took
a
quick
invintery
sorr
of
the
removables
he
answered
fingering
his
cap
nervously
that
how
it
was
sorr
and
thim
segyars
was
lyin
there
in
the
box
forninst
me
eyes
and
how
do
you
account
for
the
removal
of
these
removables
as
you
call
them
barney
i
asked
looking
coldly
at
him
he
saw
he
was
under
suspicion
and
he
winced
but
pulled
himself
together
in
an
instant
i
expected
the
question
sorr
he
said
calmly
and
i
have
me
answer
ready
thim
segyars
was
shmoked
sorr
doubtless
said
i
with
an
sneer
and
by
whom
cats
i
added
with
a
contemptuous
shrug
of
my
shoulders
his
answer
overpowered
me
it
was
so
simple
direct
and
unexpected
shpooks
he
replied
laconically
i
gasped
in
astonishment
and
sat
down
my
knees
simply
collapsed
under
me
and
i
could
no
more
have
continued
to
stand
up
than
fly
what
i
cried
as
soon
as
i
had
recovered
sufficiently
to
gasp
out
the
word
shpooks
replied
barney
ut
came
about
like
this
sorr
it
was
the
froiday
two
wakes
afther

left
i
became
loike
along
about

cried
excitedly

said
barney
whose
calmness
was
now
beautiful
to
look
upon
he
was
so
serenely
confident
of
his
position
does
smoke
involve
a
fire
i
demanded
sometimes
said
barney
i
ye
meant
a
conflagrashun
sorr
the
shmoke

i
observed
i
am
glad

said
barney
pleasantly
he
was
getting
along
so
swimmingly
this
shmoke
as
i
say
was
segyar
shmoke
so
i
gropes
me
way
cautious
loike
up

back
sthairs
and
listens
by
the
library
dure
all
quiet
as
a

i
shteps
into
the
room
and
nearly
drops
wid
the
shcare
i
have
on

in
a
minute
the
room
was
dark
as
a

sorr
but
in
different
shpots
ranged
round
in
the
chairs

six
little
red
balls
of

he
impressively
and
you
saw
what
i
queried
growing
very
impatient
what
i
hope
niver
to

sorr
said
barney
compressing
his
lips
solemnly
impty

wid
six
segyars
as
hoigh
up
from
the
flure
as
a

out

i

i
wanted
to

but
i
shtood
rutted
to
the
shpot
wid
th
surproise
i
had
on
me
until
foinally
ivery
segyar
was
burnt
to
a
shtub
and
trun
into
the
foireplace
where
i
found
the
nixt
mornin
when
i
came
to
clane
up
provin
ut
was
ony
dhrame
been
havin
i
arose
from
my
chair
and
paced
the
room
for
two
or
three
minutes
wondering
what
i
could
say
of
course
the
man
was
lying
i
thought
then
i
pulled
myself
together
barney
i
said
severely
what
the
use
do
you
expect
me
to
believe
any
such
story
as
that
no
sorr
said
he
but
thim
the
facts
do
you
mean
to
say
that
this
house
of
mine
is
haunted
i
cried
illustration
impty
chairs
sorr
i
do
know
said
barney
quietly
i
did
so
before
before
before
what
when
i
asked
whin
you
was
writin
shtories
about
ut
sorr
said
barney
respectfully
you
had
a
black
sofy
turn
white
in
a
single
noight
sorr
for
the
soight
of
horror
ut
witnessed
had
the
hair
of
your
own
head
shtand
on
ind
loike
tinpenny
nails
at
what
you
seen
here
in
this
very
room
yourself
sorr
you
had
ghosts
doin
all
sorts
of
in
the
shtories
you
been
for
years
and
always
swore
they
was
thrue
i
believe
when
i
read
but
whin
i
see
thim
segyars
shmoked
up
before
me
eyes
by
invishible
i
sez
to
meself
sez
i
the
boss
ai
such
a
dommed
loiar
afther
all
i
follyd
your
writin
sorr
very
careful
and
close
loike
an
i
do
see
how
afther
the
tales
you
told
about
your
own
experiences
right
here
you
can
say
consishtently
that
this
wan
o
mine
ai
so
but
why
barney
i
asked
to
confuse
him
when
a
thing
like
this
happened
did
you
write
and
tell
me
barney
chuckled
as
only
one
of
his
species
can
chuckle
wroite
an
tell
ye
he
cried
be
gorry
sorr
if
i
could
wroite
at
all
at
all
ut
not
you
oi
be
wroitin
that
tale
to
but
to
the
edithor
of
the
paper
that
you
wroite
for
a
tale
loike
that
is
wort
tin
dollars
to
any
man
eshpecially
if
ut
thrue
but
i
niver
learned
the
art
and
with
that
barney
left
me
overwhelmed
subsequently
i
gave
him
the
ten
dollars
which
i
think
his
story
is
worth
but
i
must
confess
that
i
am
in
a
dilemma
after
what
i
have
said
about
my
supernatural
guests
i
can
not
discharge
barney
for
lying
but
i
be
blest
if
i
can
quite
believe
that
his
story
is
accurate
in
every
respect
if
there
should
happen
to
be
among
the
readers
of
this
tale
any
who
have
made
a
sufficiently
close
study
of
the
habits
of
hired
men
and
ghosts
to
be
able
to
shed
any
light
upon
the
situation
nothing
would
please
me
more
than
to
hear
from
them
i
may
add
in
closing
that
barney
has
resumed
smoking
the
exorcism
that
failed
i
a
jubilee
experience
it
has
happened
again
i
have
been
haunted
once
more
and
this
time
by
the
most
obnoxious
spook
i
have
ever
had
the
bliss
of
meeting
he
is
homely
squat
and
excessively
vulgar
in
his
dress
and
manner
i
have
met
cockneys
in
my
day
and
some
of
the
most
offensive
varieties
at
that
but
this
spook
absolutely
outcocknifies
them
all
and
the
worst
of
it
is
i
ca
seem
to
rid
myself
of
him
he
has
pursued
me
like
an
avenging
angel
for
quite
six
months
and
every
plan
of
exorcism
that
i
have
tried
so
far
has
failed
including
the
receipt
given
me
by
my
friend
peters
who
next
to
myself
knows
more
about
ghosts
that
any
man
living
it
was
in
london
that
i
first
encountered
the
vulgar
little
creature
who
has
made
my
life
a
sore
trial
ever
since
and
with
whom
i
am
still
coping
to
the
best
of
my
powers
starting
out
early
in
the
morning
of
june
last
summer
to
witness
the
pageant
of
her
majesty
queen
victoria
diamond
jubilee
i
secured
a
good
place
on
the
corner
of
northumberland
avenue
and
trafalgar
square
there
were
two
rows
of
people
ahead
of
me
but
i
did
not
mind
that
those
directly
before
me
were
short
and
i
could
easily
see
over
their
heads
and
furthermore
i
was
protected
from
the
police
who
in
london
are
the
most
dangerous
people
i
have
ever
encountered
not
having
the
genial
ways
of
the
irish
bobbies
who
keep
the
new
york
crowds
smiling
who
when
you
are
pushed
into
the
line
of
march
merely
punch
you
in
a
ticklish
spot
with
the
end
of
their
clubs
instead
of
smashing
your
hair
down
into
your
larynx
with
their
sticks
as
do
their
london
prototypes
it
was
very
comforting
to
me
having
witnessed
the
pageant
of
when
the
queen
celebrated
her
fiftieth
anniversary
as
a
potentate
and
thereby
learned
the
english
police
system
of
dealing
with
crowds
to
know
that
there
were
at
least
two
rows
of
heads
to
be
split
open
before
my
turn
came
and
i
had
formed
the
good
resolution
to
depart
as
soon
as
the
first
row
had
been
thus
treated
whether
i
missed
seeing
the
procession
or
not
i
had
not
been
long
at
my
post
when
the
crowds
concentrating
on
the
line
of
march
coming
up
the
avenue
from
the
embankment
began
to
shove
intolerably
from
the
rear
and
it
was
as
much
as
i
could
do
to
keep
my
place
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
undersized
cockney
who
stood
in
front
of
me
appeared
to
offer
no
resistance
to
the
pressure
of
my
waistcoat
against
his
narrow
little
back
it
seemed
strange
that
it
should
be
so
but
i
appeared
despite
his
presence
to
have
nothing
of
a
material
nature
ahead
of
me
and
i
found
myself
bent
at
an
angle
of
degrees
my
feet
firmly
planted
before
me
like
those
of
a
balky
horse
restraining
the
onward
tendency
of
the
mob
back
of
me
strong
as
i
am
however
and
stubborn
i
am
not
a
stone
wall
ten
feet
thick
at
the
base
and
the
pressure
brought
to
bear
upon
my
poor
self
was
soon
too
great
for
my
strength
and
i
gradually
encroached
upon
my
unresisting
friend
he
turned
and
hurled
a
few
remarks
at
me
that
are
not
printable
yet
he
was
of
no
more
assistance
in
withstanding
the
pressure
than
a
marrowfat
pea
well
cooked
would
have
been
i
sorry
i
said
apologetically
but
i
ca
help
it
if
these
policemen
would
run
around
to
the
rear
and
massacre
some
of
the
populace
who
are
pushing
me
i
should
have
to
shove
you
well
all
i
got
to
say
he
retorted
is
that
if
you
do
keep
your
carcass
out
of
my
ribs
i
haunt
you
to
your
dying
day
if
you
only
put
up
a
little
backbone
yourself
you
make
it
easier
for
me
i
replied
quite
hotly
what
are
you
anyhow
a
or
an
man
he
had
time
to
answer
for
just
as
i
spoke
an
irresistible
shove
from
the
crowd
pushed
me
slap
up
against
the
man
in
the
front
row
and
i
was
appalled
to
find
the
little
fellow
between
us
bulging
out
on
both
sides
of
me
crushed
longitudinally
from
top
to
toe
so
that
he
resembled
a
paper
doll
before
the
crease
is
removed
from
its
middle
open
great
heavens
i
muttered
what
have
i
struck
illustration
lul
let
me
out
he
gasped
me
out
he
gasped
do
you
see
you
are
my
figure
out
of
shape
get
blank
it
i
ca
i
panted
i
sorry
but
sorry
be
hanged
he
roared
this
is
my
place
you
idiot
this
was
too
much
for
me
and
in
my
inability
to
kick
him
with
my
foot
i
did
it
with
my
knee
and
then
if
i
had
not
been
excited
i
should
have
learned
the
unhappy
truth
my
knee
went
straight
through
him
and
shoved
the
man
ahead
into
the
of
the
bobbie
in
front
it
was
fortunate
for
me
that
it
happened
as
it
did
for
the
man
was
wrathful
enough
to
have
struck
me
but
the
police
took
care
of
him
and
as
he
was
carried
away
on
a
stretcher
the
little
came
back
into
his
normal
proportions
like
an
inflated
toy
what
the
deuce
are
you
anyhow
i
cried
aghast
at
the
spectacle
you
find
out
before
you
are
a
year
older
he
wrathfully
answered
i
show
you
a
shoving
trick
or
two
that
you
wo
like
you
blooming
yank
it
made
me
excessively
angry
to
be
called
a
blooming
yank
i
am
a
yankee
and
i
have
been
known
to
bloom
but
i
ca
stand
having
a
britisher
apply
that
term
to
me
as
if
it
were
an
opprobrious
thing
to
be
so
i
tried
once
more
to
kick
him
with
my
knee
again
my
knee
passed
through
him
and
this
time
took
the
policeman
himself
in
the
vicinity
of
his
the
irate
officer
turned
quickly
raised
his
club
and
struck
viciously
not
at
the
little
creature
but
at
me
he
did
seem
to
see
the
jelly
and
then
the
horrid
truth
flashed
across
my
mind
the
thing
in
front
of
me
was
a
ghost
a
miserable
relic
of
some
bygone
pageant
and
visible
only
to
myself
who
have
an
eye
to
that
sort
of
thing
luckily
the
bobbie
missed
his
stroke
and
as
i
apologized
telling
him
i
had
vitus
dance
and
could
not
control
my
unhappy
leg
accompanying
the
apology
with
a
half
sovereign
both
of
which
were
accepted
peace
reigned
and
i
shortly
had
the
bliss
of
seeing
the
whole
sovereign
ride
by
that
is
i
was
told
that
the
lady
behind
the
parasol
which
obscured
everything
but
her
elbow
was
her
majesty
the
queen
nothing
more
of
interest
happened
between
this
and
the
end
of
the
procession
although
the
little
spook
in
front
occasionally
turned
and
paid
me
a
compliment
which
would
have
cost
any
material
creature
his
life
but
that
night
something
of
importance
did
happen
and
it
has
been
going
on
ever
since
the
unlovely
creature
turned
up
in
my
lodgings
just
as
i
was
about
to
retire
and
talked
in
his
rasping
voice
until
long
after
four
i
ordered
him
out
and
he
declined
to
go
i
struck
at
him
but
it
was
like
hitting
smoke
all
right
said
i
putting
on
my
clothes
if
you
wo
get
out
i
will
that
exactly
what
i
intended
you
to
do
he
said
how
do
you
like
being
shoved
eh
yesterday
was
the
of
june
i
shall
keep
shoving
you
along
even
as
you
shoved
me
for
exactly
one
year
humph
i
retorted
you
called
me
a
blooming
yank
yesterday
i
am
i
shall
soon
be
out
of
your
reach
in
the
great
and
glorious
united
states
oh
as
for
that
he
answered
calmly
i
can
go
to
the
united
states
there
are
steamers
in
great
plenty
i
could
even
get
myself
blown
across
on
a
gale
if
i
wanted
to
only
gales
are
not
always
convenient
some
of
do
go
all
the
way
through
and
connections
are
hard
to
make
a
gale
i
was
riding
on
once
stopped
in
and
i
had
to
wait
a
week
before
another
came
along
and
it
landed
me
in
africa
instead
of
at
new
york
got
aboard
the
wrong
gale
eh
said
i
with
a
laugh
yes
he
answered
did
you
drown
i
cried
somewhat
interested
idiot
he
retorted
drown
how
could
i
you
ca
drown
a
ghost
see
here
said
i
if
you
call
me
an
idiot
again
i
i
what
he
put
in
with
a
grin
now
just
what
will
you
do
clever
but
a
ghost
illustration
i
shall
keep
shoving
you
for
exactly
one
year
you
wait
and
see
said
i
rushing
angrily
from
the
room
it
was
a
very
weak
retort
and
i
frankly
admit
that
i
am
ashamed
of
it
but
it
was
the
best
i
had
at
hand
at
the
moment
my
stock
of
repartee
like
most
men
vitality
is
at
its
lowest
ebb
at
four
in
the
morning
for
three
or
four
hours
i
wandered
aimlessly
about
the
city
and
then
returned
to
my
room
and
found
it
deserted
but
in
the
course
of
my
peregrinations
i
had
acquired
a
most
consuming
appetite
usually
i
eat
very
little
breakfast
but
this
morning
nothing
short
of
a
dinner
could
satisfy
my
ravening
so
instead
of
eating
my
modest
boiled
egg
i
sought
the
savoy
and
at
nine
entered
the
of
that
highly
favored
caravansary
imagine
my
delight
upon
entering
to
see
sitting
near
one
of
the
windows
my
newly
made
acquaintances
of
the
steamer
the
travises
of
boston
miss
travis
looking
more
beautiful
than
ever
and
quite
as
haughty
by
whom
i
was
invited
to
join
them
i
accepted
with
alacrity
and
was
just
about
to
partake
of
a
particularly
nice
melon
when
who
should
walk
in
but
that
vulgar
little
spectre
hat
jauntily
placed
on
one
side
of
his
head
trousers
loud
enough
to
wake
the
dead
and
a
green
plaid
vest
about
his
middle
that
would
be
an
indictable
offence
even
on
an
american
golf
links
thank
heaven
they
ca
see
the
brute
i
muttered
as
he
approached
hullo
old
chappie
he
cried
slapping
me
on
my
back
introduce
me
to
your
charming
friends
and
with
this
he
gave
a
horrible
low
smirk
at
miss
travis
to
whom
to
my
infinite
sorrow
by
some
accursed
miracle
he
appeared
as
plainly
visible
as
he
was
to
me
really
said
travis
turning
coldly
to
me
we
we
ca
you
know
we
come
eleanor
we
will
leave
this
with
his
and
have
our
breakfast
sent
to
our
rooms
and
with
that
they
rose
up
and
scornfully
departed
the
creature
then
sat
down
in
miss
travis
chair
and
began
to
devour
her
roll
see
here
i
cried
finally
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
shove
number
two
he
replied
with
his
unholy
smirk
very
successful
eh
werl
just
you
wait
for
number
three
it
will
be
what
you
americans
call
a
corker
and
with
that
he
vanished
just
in
time
to
spare
me
the
humiliation
of
shying
a
pot
of
coffee
at
his
head
of
course
my
appetite
vanished
with
him
and
my
main
duty
now
seemed
to
be
to
seek
out
the
travises
and
explain
so
leaving
the
balance
of
my
breakfast
untasted
i
sought
the
office
and
sent
my
card
up
to
travis
the
response
was
immediate
the
loidy
says
she
gone
out
sir
and
ai
likely
to
be
back
remarked
the
buttons
upon
his
return
i
was
so
maddened
by
this
slight
and
so
thoroughly
apprehensive
of
further
trouble
from
the
infernal
shade
that
i
resolved
without
more
ado
to
sneak
out
of
england
and
back
to
america
before
the
deadly
blighting
thing
was
aware
of
my
intentions
i
immediately
left
the
savoy
and
sought
the
office
of
the
green
star
line
secured
a
room
on
the
steamer
sailing
the
next
morning
the
from
liverpool
and
was
about
packing
up
my
belongings
when
turned
up
again
going
away
eh
yes
i
replied
shortly
and
then
i
endeavored
to
deceive
him
i
been
invited
down
to
leamington
to
spend
a
week
with
my
old
friend
dr
liverton
oh
indeed
he
observed
thanks
for
the
address
i
will
not
neglect
you
during
your
stay
there
be
prepared
for
a
shove
that
will
turn
your
hair
gray
and
he
vanished
muttering
the
address
i
had
given
him
liverton
leamington
dr
liverton
to
which
he
added
i
forget
not
by
a
jugful
i
chuckled
softly
to
myself
as
he
disappeared
he
clever
but
there
are
others
i
said
delighted
at
the
ease
with
which
i
had
rid
myself
of
him
and
then
eating
a
hearty
luncheon
i
took
the
train
to
liverpool
where
next
morning
i
embarked
on
the
for
new
york
ii
an
unhappy
voyage
the
sense
of
relief
that
swept
over
me
when
the
great
anchor
of
the
came
up
from
the
unstrained
quality
of
the
mersey
and
i
thought
of
the
fact
that
shortly
a
vast
ocean
would
roll
between
me
and
that
fearful
spook
was
one
of
the
most
delightful
emotions
that
it
has
ever
been
my
good
fortune
to
experience
now
all
seemed
serene
and
i
sought
my
cabin
belowstairs
whistling
gayly
but
alas
how
fleeting
is
happiness
even
to
a
whistler
as
i
drew
near
to
the
room
which
i
had
fondly
supposed
was
to
be
my
own
exclusively
i
heard
profane
remarks
issuing
therefrom
there
was
condemnation
of
the
soap
there
was
perdition
for
the
lighting
apparatus
there
were
maledictions
upon
the
location
of
the
port
and
the
bedding
was
excommunicate
this
is
strange
said
i
to
the
steward
i
have
engaged
this
room
for
the
passage
i
hear
somebody
in
there
not
at
all
sir
said
he
opening
the
door
it
is
empty
and
to
him
it
undoubtedly
appeared
to
be
so
but
i
cried
did
you
hear
anything
yes
i
did
he
said
candidly
but
i
supposed
you
was
a
ventriloquist
sir
and
was
up
of
a
game
on
me
here
the
steward
smiled
and
i
was
too
angry
to
retort
and
then
well
you
have
guessed
it
turned
up
and
more
vulgar
than
ever
hullo
he
said
nonchalantly
fooling
with
a
going
over
oh
no
i
replied
sarcastic
just
out
for
a
swim
when
we
get
off
the
banks
i
going
to
jump
overboard
and
swim
to
the
azores
on
a
wager
how
much
he
asked
five
bob
said
i
feeling
that
he
could
not
grasp
a
larger
amount
humph
he
ejaculated
i
rather
drive
a
cab
as
i
used
to
ah
said
i
that
what
you
were
eh
a
takes
a
mighty
mind
to
be
that
eh
splendid
intellectual
effort
to
drive
a
cab
from
the
reform
club
to
the
bank
eh
i
had
hoped
to
wither
him
oh
i
do
know
he
answered
suavely
i
tell
you
this
though
i
rather
go
from
the
club
to
the
bank
on
my
hansom
with
me
holding
the
reins
than
try
to
do
it
with
gladstone
or
the
prince
o
wiles
on
the
box
prince
o
wiles
i
said
with
a
withering
manner
that
what
i
said
he
retorted
you
would
call
him
prince
of
whales
i
suppose
like
a
yank
a
blooming
yank
because
you
think
britannia
rules
the
waves
i
had
to
laugh
and
then
a
plan
of
conciliation
suggested
itself
i
would
jolly
him
as
my
political
friends
have
it
have
a
drink
i
asked
no
thanks
i
do
indulge
he
replied
let
me
offer
you
a
cigar
i
accepted
and
he
extracted
a
very
weed
from
his
box
which
he
handed
me
i
tried
to
bite
off
the
end
succeeding
only
in
biting
my
tongue
whereat
the
presence
roared
with
laughter
what
the
joke
now
i
queried
irritated
you
he
answered
the
idea
of
any
one
being
fool
enough
to
try
to
bite
off
the
end
of
a
spook
cigar
strikes
me
as
funny
from
that
moment
all
thought
of
conciliation
vanished
and
i
resorted
to
abuse
you
are
a
thing
i
shouted
and
if
you
do
get
out
of
here
right
away
i
break
every
bone
in
your
body
very
well
he
answered
coolly
scribbling
on
a
pad
close
at
hand
there
the
address
what
address
i
asked
of
the
cemetery
where
those
bones
you
are
going
to
break
are
to
be
found
you
go
in
by
the
side
gate
and
ask
any
of
the
where
you
infernal
scoundrel
i
shrieked
this
is
my
room
i
have
bought
and
paid
for
it
and
i
intend
to
have
it
do
you
hear
his
response
was
merely
the
clapping
of
his
hands
together
and
in
a
leaning
towards
me
he
said
bravo
bravo
you
are
great
i
think
you
could
do
lear
say
those
last
words
again
will
you
his
calmness
was
too
much
for
me
and
i
lost
all
control
of
myself
picking
up
the
i
hurled
it
at
him
with
all
the
force
at
my
command
it
crashed
through
him
and
struck
the
mirror
over
the
and
as
the
shattered
glass
fell
with
a
loud
noise
to
the
floor
the
door
to
my
opened
and
the
captain
of
the
ship
flanked
by
the
room
steward
and
the
doctor
stood
at
the
opening
what
all
this
about
said
the
captain
addressing
me
i
have
engaged
this
room
for
myself
alone
i
said
trembling
in
my
rage
and
i
object
to
that
person
presence
here
i
pointed
at
the
intruder
what
person
presence
demanded
the
captain
looking
at
the
spot
where
the
haunting
thing
sat
grinning
indecently
what
person
i
roared
forgetting
the
situation
for
the
moment
why
him
it
whatever
you
choose
to
call
it
he
settled
down
here
and
has
been
me
for
twenty
minutes
and
damn
it
captain
i
wo
stand
it
it
a
clear
case
said
the
captain
with
a
sigh
turning
and
addressing
the
doctor
have
you
a
thank
you
captain
said
i
calming
down
it
what
he
ought
to
have
but
it
wo
do
any
good
you
see
he
not
a
material
thing
he
buried
in
kensal
green
cemetery
and
so
the
help
us
here
the
doctor
stepped
into
the
room
and
took
me
gently
by
the
arm
take
off
your
clothes
he
said
and
lie
down
you
need
quiet
i
i
demanded
not
as
yet
realizing
my
position
not
by
a
long
shot
fire
out
that
all
i
ask
take
off
your
clothes
and
get
into
that
bed
repeated
the
doctor
peremptorily
then
he
turned
to
the
captain
and
asked
him
to
detail
two
of
his
sailors
to
help
him
he
going
to
be
troublesome
he
added
in
a
whisper
mad
as
a
hatter
i
hesitate
in
fact
decline
to
go
through
the
agony
of
what
followed
again
by
writing
of
it
in
detail
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
doctor
persisted
in
his
order
that
i
should
undress
and
go
to
bed
and
i
conscious
of
the
righteousness
of
my
position
fought
this
determination
until
with
the
assistance
of
the
steward
and
the
two
seamen
detailed
by
the
captain
at
the
request
i
was
forcibly
unclad
and
thrown
into
the
lower
berth
and
strapped
down
my
wrath
knew
no
bounds
and
i
spoke
my
mind
as
plainly
as
i
knew
how
it
is
a
terrible
thing
to
be
sane
healthy
fond
of
full
of
life
and
withal
unjustly
strapped
to
a
lower
berth
below
the
on
a
hot
day
because
of
a
little
beast
of
a
cockney
ghost
and
i
fairly
howled
my
sentiments
illustration
i
was
forcibly
unclad
on
the
second
day
from
liverpool
two
maiden
ladies
in
the
room
next
mine
made
representations
to
the
captain
which
resulted
in
my
removal
to
the
steerage
they
could
consent
they
said
to
listen
to
the
shrieks
of
the
maniac
in
the
adjoining
room
and
then
when
i
found
myself
lying
on
a
cot
in
the
steerage
still
strapped
down
who
should
appear
but
my
little
spectre
well
he
said
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
cot
what
do
you
think
of
it
now
eh
ai
i
a
shover
from
shoverville
on
the
push
it
all
right
i
said
contemptuously
but
i
tell
you
one
thing
mr
spook
when
i
die
and
have
a
ghost
of
my
own
that
ghost
will
seek
you
out
and
by
thunder
if
it
does
thrash
the
life
out
of
you
i
disown
it
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
paled
a
bit
at
this
but
i
was
too
tired
to
gloat
over
a
little
thing
like
that
so
i
closed
my
eyes
and
went
to
sleep
a
few
days
later
i
was
so
calm
and
rational
that
the
doctor
released
me
and
for
the
remainder
of
my
voyage
i
was
as
free
as
any
other
person
on
board
except
that
i
found
myself
constantly
under
surveillance
and
was
of
course
much
irritated
by
the
notion
that
my
spacious
stateroom
was
not
only
out
of
my
reach
but
probably
in
the
undisputed
possession
of
the
cockney
ghost
after
seven
days
of
ocean
travel
new
york
was
reached
and
i
was
allowed
to
step
ashore
without
molestation
but
my
infernal
friend
turned
up
on
the
pier
and
added
injury
to
insult
by
declaring
in
my
behalf
certain
dutiable
articles
in
my
trunks
thereby
costing
me
some
dollars
which
i
should
much
rather
have
saved
still
after
the
incidents
of
the
voyage
i
thought
it
well
to
say
nothing
and
accepted
the
hardships
of
the
experience
in
the
hope
that
in
the
far
distant
future
my
spook
would
meet
his
and
thrash
the
very
death
out
of
him
well
things
went
on
the
cockney
spook
left
me
to
my
own
devices
until
november
when
i
had
occasion
to
lecture
at
a
certain
college
in
the
northwest
i
travelled
from
my
home
to
the
distant
platform
went
upon
it
was
introduced
by
the
proper
functionary
and
began
my
lecture
in
the
middle
of
the
talk
who
should
appear
in
a
vacant
chair
well
down
towards
the
stage
but
the
cockney
ghost
with
a
guffaw
at
a
strong
and
not
humorous
point
which
disconcerted
me
i
broke
down
and
left
the
platform
and
in
the
small
room
at
the
side
encountered
him
shove
the
fourth
he
cried
and
vanished
it
was
then
that
i
consulted
peters
as
to
how
best
to
be
rid
of
him
there
is
no
use
of
talking
about
it
i
said
to
peters
the
man
is
ruining
me
socially
with
the
travises
i
am
an
outcast
and
i
have
no
doubt
they
will
tell
about
it
and
my
ostracism
will
extend
on
the
my
sanity
is
seriously
questioned
and
now
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
before
some
two
thousand
people
i
break
down
in
a
public
lecture
which
i
have
delivered
dozens
of
times
hitherto
without
a
tremor
the
thing
can
not
go
on
i
should
say
not
peters
answered
maybe
i
can
help
you
to
get
rid
of
him
but
i
not
positive
about
it
my
new
scheme
is
as
yet
perfected
have
you
tried
the
treatment
i
will
say
here
that
peters
upon
two
occasions
has
completely
annihilated
unpleasant
spectres
by
turning
upon
them
the
colorless
and
odorless
liquids
whose
chemical
action
is
such
that
fire
can
not
live
in
their
presence
fire
the
vital
spark
is
the
essential
element
of
all
these
chaps
said
he
and
if
you
can
turn
the
nozzle
of
your
extinguisher
on
that
spook
your
ghost
simply
goes
out
no
i
have
i
replied
but
i
will
the
first
chance
i
get
and
i
left
him
hopeful
if
not
confident
of
a
successful
exorcism
on
my
return
home
i
got
out
two
of
the
extinguishers
which
were
left
in
my
back
hall
for
use
in
case
of
an
emergency
and
tested
one
of
them
on
the
lawn
i
merely
wished
to
ascertain
if
it
would
work
with
spirit
and
it
did
it
went
off
like
a
sodawater
fountain
loaded
with
dynamite
and
i
felt
truly
happy
for
the
first
time
in
many
days
the
vulgar
little
beast
would
better
keep
away
from
me
now
i
laughed
but
my
mirth
was
whether
or
not
the
obnoxious
little
chap
had
overheard
or
from
some
hidden
coign
had
watched
my
test
of
the
i
do
know
but
when
he
came
to
my
den
that
night
he
was
amply
protected
against
the
annihilating
effects
of
the
liquid
by
a
flaring
plaid
mackintosh
with
a
toque
for
his
head
and
the
minute
i
started
the
thing
squirting
he
turned
his
back
and
received
the
charge
harmless
on
his
shoulders
the
only
effect
of
the
experiment
was
the
drenching
and
consequent
ruin
of
a
pile
of
mss
i
had
been
at
work
on
all
day
which
gave
me
another
grudge
against
him
when
the
extinguisher
had
exhausted
itself
the
spectre
turned
about
and
fairly
raised
the
ceiling
with
his
guffaws
and
when
he
saw
my
ruined
pages
upon
the
desk
his
mirth
became
convulsive
he
cried
for
an
impromptu
shove
wherein
i
turn
over
the
shoving
to
you
in
my
own
behalf
i
never
saw
it
equalled
would
be
a
bad
thing
if
all
writers
would
wet
down
their
mss
the
same
way
now
would
it
but
i
was
too
indignant
to
reply
and
too
chagrined
over
my
failure
to
remain
so
i
rushed
out
and
paced
the
fields
for
two
hours
when
i
returned
he
had
gone
iii
the
spirit
tries
to
make
reparation
three
weeks
later
he
turned
up
once
more
great
heavens
i
cried
you
back
again
yes
he
answered
and
i
come
to
tell
you
i
mighty
sorry
about
those
ruined
mss
of
yours
it
is
too
bad
that
your
whole
day
work
had
to
go
for
nothing
illustration
he
was
amply
protected
i
think
so
myself
i
retorted
coldly
it
rather
late
in
the
day
for
you
to
be
sorry
though
if
you
show
your
sincerity
by
going
away
and
never
crossing
my
path
again
i
may
believe
in
you
ah
he
said
i
shown
it
in
another
way
indeed
i
have
you
know
i
have
some
conscience
though
to
tell
the
truth
i
made
much
use
of
it
this
time
however
as
i
considered
the
situation
a
little
voice
rose
up
within
me
and
said
all
right
old
chap
to
be
rough
on
this
person
make
him
mad
and
shove
him
every
which
way
but
do
destroy
his
work
his
work
is
what
he
lives
by
yes
i
interrupted
and
after
what
i
told
you
on
the
steamer
about
what
i
would
do
to
you
when
we
got
on
even
terms
you
are
not
anxious
to
have
me
die
i
know
just
how
you
feel
no
thing
likes
to
contemplate
that
paralysis
that
will
surely
fall
upon
you
when
my
ghost
begins
to
get
in
its
fine
work
i
putting
it
in
training
now
you
poor
droll
mortal
laughed
the
cockney
you
poor
droll
mortal
as
if
i
could
ever
be
afraid
of
that
what
is
the
matter
with
my
going
into
training
myself
two
can
train
you
know
even
three
you
almost
make
me
feel
sorry
i
tried
to
remedy
the
loss
of
those
mss
somehow
or
other
a
sense
of
some
new
misfortune
came
upon
me
what
i
said
nervously
i
say
i
almost
sorry
i
tried
to
remedy
the
loss
of
those
manuscripts
composition
particularly
poetry
is
devilish
hard
for
me
i
admit
it
and
when
i
think
of
how
i
toiled
over
my
substitutes
for
your
ruined
stuff
and
see
how
very
ungrateful
you
are
i
grudge
the
effort
i
do
understand
you
i
said
anxiously
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
i
have
written
and
sent
out
to
the
editors
of
the
papers
you
write
for
a
half
a
dozen
poems
and
short
stories
what
has
all
that
got
to
do
with
me
i
demanded
a
great
deal
he
said
you
get
the
pay
signed
your
name
to
y
you
you
you
did
what
i
cried
signed
your
name
to
there
was
a
sonnet
to
coal
grab
that
was
the
longest
of
the
lot
i
think
it
will
cover
at
least
six
magazine
pages
but
i
cried
a
sonnet
never
contains
more
than
fourteen
lines
you
fool
oh
yes
it
does
he
replied
calmly
this
one
of
yours
had
over
four
hundred
and
then
i
wrote
a
quatrain
on
which
if
i
do
say
it
is
the
funniest
thing
i
ever
read
i
sent
that
to
the
good
lord
good
lord
good
lord
i
moaned
a
quatrain
yes
he
observed
calmly
lighting
one
of
his
accursed
cigars
and
you
get
all
the
credit
a
ray
of
hope
entered
my
soul
and
it
enabled
me
to
laugh
hysterically
they
know
it
is
mine
said
i
they
know
my
handwriting
at
the
office
of
the
no
doubt
said
he
dashing
all
my
hopes
to
the
ground
but
ah
to
remedy
that
drawback
i
took
pains
to
find
out
what
you
used
and
i
had
my
quatrain
copied
on
one
of
the
same
make
but
the
letter
the
note
with
the
manuscript
i
put
in
oh
i
got
over
that
very
easily
he
said
i
had
that
written
also
on
the
machine
on
thin
paper
and
traced
your
signature
at
the
bottom
it
will
be
all
right
my
dear
fellow
they
never
suspect
and
then
looking
at
the
which
he
carried
in
his
spectral
he
vanished
leaving
me
immersed
in
the
deepest
misery
of
my
life
not
content
with
ruining
me
socially
and
as
a
lecturer
not
satisfied
with
destroying
me
mentally
on
the
seas
he
had
now
attacked
me
on
my
most
vulnerable
point
my
literary
aspirations
i
could
not
rest
until
i
had
read
his
quatrain
on
immortality
vulgar
as
i
knew
him
to
be
i
felt
confident
that
over
my
name
something
had
gone
out
which
even
in
my
least
moods
i
could
not
tolerate
the
only
comfort
that
came
to
me
was
that
his
verses
and
his
and
his
tracings
of
my
autograph
would
be
as
spectral
to
others
as
to
the
eye
not
attuned
to
the
seeing
of
ghosts
i
was
soon
to
be
undeceived
however
for
the
next
morning
mail
brought
to
my
home
a
dozen
packages
from
my
best
consumers
containing
the
maudlin
frivolings
of
this
this
this
well
there
is
no
polite
word
to
describe
him
in
any
known
tongue
i
shall
have
to
study
the
aryan
language
or
kipling
to
find
an
epithet
strong
enough
to
apply
to
this
especial
case
every
point
every
single
detail
about
these
packages
was
convincing
evidence
of
their
contents
having
been
of
my
own
production
the
return
envelopes
were
marked
at
the
upper
corner
with
my
name
and
address
the
handwriting
upon
them
was
manifestly
mine
although
i
never
in
my
life
penned
those
particular
superscriptions
within
these
envelopes
were
i
might
say
pounds
of
apparently
from
my
own
typewriting
machine
and
signed
in
an
autograph
which
would
have
deceived
even
myself
and
the
stuff
stuff
is
not
the
word
in
fact
there
is
no
word
in
any
language
however
primitive
and
impolite
that
will
describe
accurately
the
substance
of
those
pages
and
with
each
came
a
letter
from
the
editor
of
the
periodical
to
which
the
tale
or
poem
had
been
sent
me
to
stop
work
for
a
and
one
the
keeley
cure
immediately
i
sat
down
and
wrote
to
the
various
editors
to
whom
these
productions
had
been
submitted
explaining
all
and
every
one
of
them
came
back
to
me
unopened
with
the
average
statement
that
until
i
had
rested
a
year
they
really
had
the
time
to
read
what
i
wrote
and
my
best
friend
among
them
the
editor
of
the
took
the
trouble
to
telegraph
to
my
brother
the
recommendation
that
i
should
be
looked
after
and
out
of
the
mistaken
kindness
of
his
heart
he
printed
a
personal
in
his
next
issue
to
the
effect
that
his
valued
contributor
me
the
public
would
regret
to
hear
was
confined
to
his
house
by
a
sudden
and
severe
attack
of
nervous
prostration
following
it
up
with
an
estimate
of
my
career
which
bore
every
mark
of
having
been
saved
up
to
that
time
for
use
as
an
obituary
and
as
i
read
the
latter
the
obituary
over
with
tears
in
my
eyes
what
should
i
hear
but
the
words
spoken
at
my
back
clearly
but
in
unmistakable
cockney
accents
shove
the
fifth
followed
by
uproarious
laughter
i
grabbed
up
the
and
threw
it
with
all
my
strength
back
of
me
and
succeeded
only
in
destroying
the
iv
the
failure
the
destruction
of
the
not
to
mention
the
wiping
out
in
a
moment
of
my
means
of
livelihood
made
of
the
fifth
shove
an
intolerable
nuisance
controlling
myself
with
difficulty
i
put
on
my
hat
and
rushed
to
the
telegraph
office
whence
i
despatched
a
message
marked
rush
to
peters
for
heaven
sake
complete
your
exorcism
and
bring
it
here
at
once
i
wired
him
answer
collect
peters
by
no
means
soothed
my
agitation
by
his
immediate
and
extremely
flippant
response
i
do
know
why
you
wish
me
to
answer
collect
but
i
suppose
you
do
so
i
answer
as
you
request
collect
what
is
it
you
are
going
to
collect
your
scattered
faculties
he
telegraphed
it
was
a
mean
sort
of
a
telegram
to
send
to
a
man
in
my
unhappy
state
and
if
he
had
prepaid
it
i
should
never
have
forgiven
him
i
was
mad
enough
when
i
received
it
and
a
hot
retort
was
about
to
go
back
when
the
bothersome
spook
turned
up
and
drew
my
mind
off
to
other
things
well
what
do
you
think
of
me
he
said
ensconcing
himself
calmly
on
my
divan
pretty
successful
shover
myself
eh
then
he
turned
his
eye
to
the
inkspots
on
the
wall
novel
design
in
decoration
that
you
ought
to
get
employment
in
some
house
given
an
accurate
aim
and
plenty
of
ink
you
ca
be
beaten
for
vigorous
i
pretended
to
ignore
his
presence
and
there
was
a
short
pause
after
which
he
began
again
sulky
eh
oh
well
i
do
blame
you
there
nothing
in
this
world
that
can
so
harrow
up
one
soul
as
impotent
wrath
i
heard
of
people
bursting
with
it
i
had
experiences
in
the
art
of
irritation
before
this
case
there
was
a
fellow
once
hired
my
cab
for
an
hour
drove
him
all
about
london
and
then
he
stopped
in
at
a
leaving
me
outside
i
waited
and
waited
and
waited
but
he
never
came
back
left
by
the
back
door
you
know
clever
trick
and
for
a
while
the
laugh
was
on
me
but
when
i
got
to
the
point
where
i
could
haunt
him
i
did
it
to
the
regent
taste
i
found
him
three
years
after
my
demise
and
through
the
balance
of
his
life
pursued
him
everywhere
with
a
phantom
cab
if
he
went
to
church
drive
my
spectre
rig
right
down
the
middle
aisle
after
him
if
he
called
on
a
girl
there
was
the
cab
drawn
up
alongside
of
him
in
the
parlor
all
the
time
the
horse
stamping
his
foot
and
whinnying
like
all
possessed
of
course
no
one
else
saw
me
or
the
horse
or
the
cab
but
he
did
and
lord
how
mad
he
was
and
how
hopeless
finally
in
a
sudden
surge
of
wrath
at
his
impotence
he
burst
just
like
a
it
was
most
amusing
even
the
horse
laughed
thanks
for
the
story
said
i
wishing
to
anger
him
by
my
nonchalance
i
write
it
up
do
he
said
it
will
make
a
clever
sixth
shove
for
me
people
say
your
fancies
are
too
wild
and
extravagant
even
now
a
story
like
that
will
finish
you
at
once
again
thanks
said
i
very
calmly
this
time
for
the
hint
acting
on
your
advice
i
wo
write
it
up
do
he
retorted
and
be
forever
haunted
with
the
idea
either
way
it
suits
me
and
he
vanished
once
more
the
next
morning
peters
arrived
at
my
house
i
come
he
said
as
he
entered
my
den
the
scheme
is
perfected
at
last
and
possibly
you
can
use
it
you
need
help
of
some
kind
i
can
see
that
just
by
reading
your
telegram
you
nervous
as
a
cat
how
do
you
heat
your
house
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
i
demanded
irritably
you
evaporate
the
little
cuss
do
want
to
peters
replied
that
been
tried
before
and
it
does
work
my
scheme
is
a
better
one
than
that
did
you
ever
notice
while
smoking
in
a
house
that
is
heated
by
a
furnace
how
when
a
cloud
of
smoke
gets
caught
in
the
current
of
air
from
the
register
it
is
mauled
and
twisted
until
it
gets
free
or
else
is
torn
entirely
apart
yes
i
have
said
i
what
of
it
well
what
the
matter
with
being
genial
with
your
old
cockney
until
he
gets
in
the
habit
of
coming
here
every
night
and
bide
your
time
until
without
his
knowing
it
you
can
turn
a
blast
from
the
furnace
on
him
that
will
simply
rend
him
to
pieces
by
jove
i
cried
delightedly
you
are
a
genius
old
chap
i
rose
and
shook
his
hand
until
he
remonstrated
save
your
energy
for
him
said
he
you
need
it
it
wo
be
a
pleasant
spectacle
to
witness
when
in
his
struggles
to
get
away
he
is
gradually
dismembered
it
will
be
something
like
the
drawing
and
quartering
punishment
of
olden
times
i
shuddered
as
i
thought
of
it
and
for
a
moment
was
disposed
to
reject
the
plan
but
my
weakness
left
me
as
i
thought
of
the
ruin
that
stared
me
in
the
face
oh
i
do
know
i
said
shaking
my
head
it
will
have
its
pleasurable
side
however
fearsome
it
may
prove
as
a
sight
this
house
is
just
fitted
for
the
operation
particularly
on
warm
days
i
have
seen
times
when
the
blasts
of
hot
air
from
my
furnace
have
blown
one
of
my
poems
off
my
table
across
the
room
great
scott
cried
peters
what
a
cyclone
of
an
you
must
have
fortunately
the
winter
season
was
on
and
we
were
able
to
test
the
capacity
of
the
furnace
with
gratifying
results
a
was
blown
and
allowed
to
float
downward
until
the
current
was
reached
and
the
novel
shapes
it
took
as
it
was
blown
about
the
room
in
its
struggles
to
escape
before
it
burst
were
truly
wonderful
i
doubted
not
for
an
instant
from
what
i
then
saw
that
the
little
cad
of
a
spectre
that
was
ruining
my
life
would
soon
meet
his
nemesis
so
convinced
was
i
of
the
ultimate
success
of
the
plan
that
i
could
hardly
wait
patiently
for
his
coming
i
became
morbidly
anxious
for
the
horrid
spectacle
which
i
should
witness
as
his
body
was
torn
apart
and
gradually
annihilated
by
the
relentless
output
of
my
furnace
flues
to
my
great
annoyance
it
was
two
weeks
before
he
turned
up
again
and
i
was
beginning
to
fear
that
he
had
in
some
wise
got
wind
of
my
intentions
and
was
turning
my
disappointment
over
his
absence
into
the
sixth
of
his
series
of
shoves
finally
however
my
anxiety
was
set
at
rest
by
his
appearance
on
a
night
especially
adapted
to
a
successful
issue
of
the
conspiracy
it
was
blowing
great
guns
from
the
west
and
the
blasts
of
air
intermittent
in
their
force
that
came
up
through
the
flues
were
such
that
under
other
circumstances
they
would
have
annoyed
me
tremendously
almost
everything
in
the
line
of
the
current
that
issued
from
the
register
and
passed
diagonally
across
the
room
to
my
fireplace
and
so
on
up
the
chimney
was
disturbed
the
effect
upon
particles
of
paper
and
the
fringes
on
my
chairs
was
almost
that
of
a
pneumatic
tube
on
substances
placed
within
it
and
on
one
or
two
occasions
i
was
seriously
apprehensive
of
the
manner
in
which
the
flames
on
the
hearth
leaped
upward
into
the
sooty
heights
of
my
chimney
flues
but
when
as
happened
shortly
i
suddenly
became
conscious
that
my
spectre
cockney
had
materialized
all
my
fears
for
the
safety
of
my
house
fled
and
i
surreptitiously
turned
off
the
heat
so
that
once
he
got
within
range
of
the
register
i
could
turn
it
on
again
and
his
annihilation
would
be
as
instantaneous
as
what
my
newspaper
friends
call
an
electrocution
and
that
was
precisely
where
i
made
my
mistake
although
i
must
confess
that
what
ensued
when
i
got
the
nauseating
creature
within
range
was
most
delightful
did
expect
me
back
eh
he
said
as
he
materialized
in
my
library
missed
me
i
suppose
eh
i
missed
you
like
the
deuce
i
replied
cordially
holding
out
my
hand
as
if
welcoming
him
back
whereat
he
frowned
suspiciously
now
that
i
reconciled
to
your
system
and
know
that
there
is
no
possible
escape
for
me
i
do
seem
to
feel
so
badly
how
have
you
been
and
what
have
you
been
doing
bah
he
retorted
what
up
now
you
know
mighty
well
you
like
me
any
better
than
you
ever
did
what
funny
little
game
are
you
trying
to
work
on
me
now
eh
really
i
replied
you
wrong
me
and
excuse
me
for
calling
you
it
is
the
most
appropriate
name
i
can
think
of
at
the
moment
call
me
what
you
blooming
please
he
answered
but
remember
you
ca
me
into
believing
you
like
me
he
added
shivering
it
beastly
cold
in
here
what
you
been
doing
storing
ice
well
there
a
fire
burning
over
there
in
the
fireplace
said
i
anxious
to
get
him
before
the
open
for
by
a
natural
law
that
was
directly
in
the
line
of
the
current
he
looked
at
me
suspiciously
and
then
at
the
fireplace
with
equal
mistrust
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
a
mocking
laugh
that
jarred
humph
he
said
what
your
scheme
got
some
patent
explosive
logs
full
of
chemicals
to
destroy
me
i
laughed
how
suspicious
you
are
i
said
yes
i
always
am
of
suspicious
characters
he
replied
planting
himself
immediately
in
front
of
the
register
desirous
no
doubt
of
acting
directly
contrary
to
my
suggestion
my
opportunity
had
come
more
easily
than
i
expected
there
is
any
heat
here
said
he
it
turned
off
i
turn
it
on
for
you
said
i
scarcely
able
to
contain
myself
with
excitement
and
i
did
well
as
i
say
the
spectacle
was
pleasing
but
it
did
not
work
as
i
had
intended
he
was
caught
in
the
full
current
not
in
any
of
the
destroying
eddyings
of
the
side
upon
which
i
had
counted
to
twist
his
legs
off
and
wring
his
neck
like
the
it
is
true
he
was
blown
into
various
odd
fantastic
shapes
such
as
crullers
resolve
themselves
into
when
not
properly
looked
after
but
there
was
no
dismembering
of
his
body
he
struggled
hard
to
free
himself
and
such
grotesque
attitudes
as
his
figure
assumed
i
never
saw
even
in
one
of
aubrey
beardsley
finest
pictures
and
once
as
his
leg
and
right
arm
verged
on
the
edge
of
one
of
the
outside
eddies
i
hoped
to
see
these
members
elongated
like
a
piece
of
elastic
until
they
snapped
off
but
with
a
superhuman
struggle
he
got
them
free
with
the
loss
only
of
one
of
his
fingers
by
which
time
the
current
had
blown
him
across
the
room
and
directly
in
front
of
my
fender
to
keep
from
going
up
the
chimney
he
tried
to
brace
himself
against
this
with
his
feet
but
missing
the
rail
as
helpless
as
a
feather
he
floated
toes
first
into
the
fireplace
and
thence
kicking
struggling
and
swearing
profanely
disappeared
into
the
flue
it
was
too
exciting
a
moment
for
me
to
laugh
over
my
triumph
but
shortly
there
came
a
nervous
reaction
which
made
me
hysterical
as
i
thought
of
his
odd
appearance
and
then
following
close
upon
this
came
the
dashing
of
my
hopes
an
infernal
misplaced
back
gust
a
diversion
in
which
thanks
to
an
improper
construction
my
chimney
frequently
indulges
blew
the
unhappy
creature
back
into
the
room
again
strained
sprained
panting
minus
the
finger
he
had
lost
and
so
angry
that
he
quivered
all
over
what
his
first
words
were
i
shall
not
repeat
they
fairly
seethed
out
of
his
turned
and
twisted
soul
hissing
like
the
of
an
ocean
steamer
and
his
eyes
as
they
fell
upon
mine
actually
burned
me
this
settles
it
he
hissed
venomously
i
had
intended
letting
you
off
with
one
more
shove
but
now
after
your
dastardly
attempt
to
rend
me
apart
with
your
damned
furnace
i
shall
haunt
you
to
your
dying
day
i
shall
haunt
you
so
terribly
that
years
before
your
final
exit
from
this
world
you
will
pray
for
death
as
a
shover
you
have
found
me
equal
to
everything
but
since
you
prefer
twisting
twisting
be
it
you
shall
hear
from
me
again
he
vanished
and
i
must
confess
it
i
threw
myself
upon
my
couch
weeping
hot
tears
of
despair
peters
scheme
had
failed
and
i
was
in
a
far
worse
position
than
ever
shoving
i
can
stand
but
the
brief
exhibition
of
twisting
that
i
had
had
in
watching
his
struggles
with
that
awful
cyclonic
blast
from
below
convinced
me
that
there
was
something
in
life
even
more
to
be
dreaded
than
the
shoving
he
and
i
had
been
indulging
in
but
there
was
a
postscript
and
now
all
is
well
again
because
but
let
us
reserve
the
wherefore
of
the
postscript
for
another
concluding
chapter
v
postscript
so
hopeless
was
my
estate
now
become
that
dreading
more
than
ever
that
which
the
inscrutable
future
held
for
me
i
sat
down
and
framed
an
advertisement
which
i
contemplated
putting
in
all
the
newspapers
weeklies
and
monthly
periodicals
offering
a
handsome
reward
for
any
suggestion
which
might
result
in
ridding
me
of
the
cockney
ghost
the
inventive
mind
of
man
has
been
able
to
cope
successfully
with
rats
and
mice
and
other
household
pests
why
then
should
there
not
be
somewhere
in
the
world
a
person
of
sufficient
ingenuity
to
cope
with
an
obnoxious
spirit
if
rat
and
rough
on
were
possible
why
was
it
not
likely
that
some
as
yet
unknown
person
had
turned
his
attention
to
spectrology
and
evolved
something
in
the
nature
of
rough
on
ghosts
spectremelinite
or
something
else
of
an
effective
nature
i
asked
myself
it
seemed
reasonable
to
suppose
that
out
of
the
millions
of
people
in
the
world
there
were
others
than
peters
and
myself
who
had
made
a
study
of
ghosts
and
methods
of
exorcising
them
and
if
these
persons
could
only
be
reached
i
might
yet
escape
accordingly
i
penned
the
advertisement
about
as
follows
wanted
by
a
young
and
rising
author
who
is
pursued
by
a
vindictive
spirit
a
ghost
cure
a
liberal
reward
will
be
paid
to
any
wizard
recognized
or
unrecognized
who
will
before
february
i
send
to
me
a
detailed
statement
of
a
guaranteed
method
of
getting
rid
of
spooks
it
is
agreed
that
these
communications
shall
be
regarded
as
strictly
confidential
until
such
a
time
as
through
their
medium
the
spirit
is
effectually
laid
after
which
time
the
cure
will
be
exploited
free
of
charge
in
the
best
advertising
mediums
of
the
day
to
this
i
appended
an
assumed
name
and
a
temporary
address
and
was
about
to
send
it
out
when
my
friend
wilkins
a
millionaire
student
of
electricity
living
in
florida
invited
me
to
spend
my
christmas
holidays
with
him
on
lake
worth
i
got
a
grand
scheme
he
wrote
which
i
am
going
to
test
and
i
like
to
have
you
present
at
the
trial
come
down
if
you
can
and
see
my
new
electric
sailboat
and
dynamic
lone
fisherman
the
idea
took
hold
of
me
at
once
in
my
nervous
state
the
change
of
scene
would
do
me
good
besides
wilkins
was
a
delightful
companion
so
forgetting
my
woes
for
the
moment
i
packed
my
trunk
and
started
south
for
wilkins
island
it
was
upon
this
trip
that
the
vengeful
spirit
put
in
his
first
twist
for
at
jacksonville
i
was
awakened
in
the
middle
of
the
night
by
a
person
whom
i
took
to
be
the
conductor
who
told
me
to
change
cars
this
i
did
and
falling
asleep
in
the
car
to
which
i
had
changed
waked
up
the
next
morning
to
find
myself
speeding
across
the
peninsula
instead
of
going
downward
towards
the
keys
as
i
should
have
done
landing
eventually
at
a
small
place
called
homosassa
on
the
gulf
coast
of
course
it
was
not
the
conductor
of
the
first
train
who
under
cover
of
the
darkness
had
led
me
astray
but
the
pursuing
spirit
as
i
found
out
when
bewildered
i
sat
upon
the
platform
of
the
station
at
homosassa
wondering
how
the
deuce
i
had
got
there
he
turned
up
at
that
moment
and
frankly
gloated
over
the
success
of
what
he
called
shove
the
seventh
and
twist
the
first
nice
place
this
said
he
with
a
nauseating
smirk
so
close
to
lake
worth
eh
only
two
days
ride
on
the
if
you
make
connections
and
when
changing
take
the
right
trains
i
pretended
not
to
see
him
and
began
to
whistle
the
intermezzo
from
cavalleria
rusticana
to
show
how
little
i
cared
good
plan
old
chap
said
he
but
it
wo
work
i
know
you
are
put
out
in
spite
of
the
tunefulness
of
your
soul
but
wait
for
my
second
twist
you
wish
you
struck
a
cyclone
instead
when
that
turn
comes
it
was
as
he
suggested
at
least
two
days
before
i
was
able
to
get
to
wilkins
at
lake
worth
but
after
i
got
there
the
sense
of
annoyance
and
the
deep
dejection
into
which
i
was
plunged
wore
away
as
well
it
might
for
the
test
which
i
was
invited
to
witness
was
most
interesting
the
dynamic
lone
fisherman
was
wonderful
enough
but
the
electric
was
a
marvel
the
former
was
very
simple
it
consisted
of
a
reel
operated
by
electricity
which
the
moment
a
struck
the
skid
at
the
end
of
the
line
reeled
the
fish
in
and
flopped
it
into
a
basket
as
easily
and
as
surely
as
you
please
but
the
principle
of
the
sailboat
was
new
i
do
need
a
breeze
to
sail
anywhere
said
wilkins
as
he
hauled
up
the
mainsail
which
flapped
idly
in
the
still
air
for
you
see
he
added
touching
a
button
alongside
of
the
tiller
this
button
sets
that
big
electric
fan
in
the
stern
revolving
and
the
result
is
an
artificial
breeze
which
distends
the
sail
and
there
you
are
it
was
even
as
he
said
a
huge
fan
with
a
dozen
flanges
in
the
stern
began
to
revolve
with
wonderful
rapidity
in
an
instant
the
sails
bellied
out
and
the
as
his
boat
was
named
was
speeding
through
the
waters
before
the
breeze
thus
created
in
fashion
by
jove
billie
i
said
this
is
a
dandy
is
it
cried
an
old
familiar
voice
at
my
elbow
i
turned
as
if
stung
the
spirit
was
with
me
again
prepared
i
doubted
not
for
his
second
twist
i
sprang
from
my
seat
a
sudden
inspiration
flashing
upon
me
jumped
back
of
the
revolving
fan
and
turning
the
full
force
of
the
wind
it
created
upon
my
vindictive
visitant
blew
him
fairly
and
squarely
into
the
bulging
sail
there
blast
your
cockney
eyes
i
cried
take
that
he
tried
to
retort
but
without
avail
the
wind
that
emanated
from
the
fan
fairly
rammed
his
words
back
into
his
throat
every
time
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
and
there
he
lay
flat
against
the
canvas
fluttering
like
a
leaf
powerless
to
escape
hot
air
does
affect
you
much
you
transparent
jackass
i
roared
let
me
see
how
a
stiff
suits
your
style
of
beauty
i
will
not
bore
the
reader
with
any
further
details
of
the
lake
worth
experience
suffice
it
to
say
that
for
five
hours
i
kept
the
miserable
thing
a
pneumatic
prisoner
in
the
concave
surface
of
the
sail
try
as
he
would
he
could
not
escape
and
finally
when
wilkins
and
i
went
ashore
for
the
night
and
the
cockney
ghost
was
released
he
vanished
using
unutterable
language
and
an
idea
came
to
me
putting
which
into
operation
i
at
last
secured
immunity
from
his
persecutions
returning
to
new
york
three
days
later
i
leased
a
small
office
in
a
power
building
not
far
from
madison
square
fitted
it
up
as
if
for
my
own
use
and
had
placed
in
the
concealment
of
a
closet
at
its
easterly
end
the
largest
electric
fan
i
could
get
it
was
ten
feet
in
diameter
and
was
provided
with
sixteen
flanges
when
it
was
in
motion
not
a
thing
could
withstand
the
blast
that
came
from
it
tables
chairs
even
a
inkstand
weighing
two
pounds
were
blown
with
a
crash
against
the
solid
stone
and
iron
construction
back
of
the
plaster
of
my
walls
and
then
i
awaited
his
coming
suffice
it
to
say
that
he
came
sat
down
calmly
and
unsuspecting
in
the
chair
i
had
had
made
for
his
especial
benefit
and
then
the
moment
he
began
to
revile
me
i
turned
on
the
power
the
fan
began
to
revolve
the
devastating
wind
rushed
down
upon
him
with
a
roar
pinned
him
to
the
wall
like
a
butterfly
on
a
cork
and
he
was
at
last
my
prisoner
and
he
is
my
prisoner
still
for
three
weeks
has
that
wheel
been
revolving
night
and
day
and
despite
all
his
cunning
he
can
not
creep
beyond
its
blustering
influence
nor
shall
he
ever
creep
therefrom
while
i
have
six
hundred
dollars
per
annum
to
pay
for
the
rent
and
cost
of
power
necessary
to
keep
the
fan
going
every
once
in
a
while
i
return
and
gloat
over
him
and
i
can
tell
by
the
movement
of
his
lips
that
he
is
trying
to
curse
me
but
he
can
not
for
even
as
wilkins
fan
blew
his
words
of
remonstrance
back
into
his
throat
so
does
my
wheel
twice
as
powerful
keep
his
torrent
of
invective
from
greeting
my
ear
illustration
pinned
him
to
the
wall
like
a
butterfly
on
a
cork
i
should
be
happy
to
prove
the
truth
of
all
this
by
showing
any
reader
the
spectacle
which
gives
me
so
much
joy
but
i
fear
to
do
so
lest
the
owners
of
the
building
discovering
the
uses
to
which
their
office
has
been
put
shall
require
me
to
vacate
the
premises
of
course
he
may
ultimately
escape
through
some
failure
of
the
machine
to
operate
but
it
is
guaranteed
to
run
five
years
without
a
break
so
for
that
period
at
least
i
am
safe
and
by
that
time
it
may
be
that
he
will
be
satisfied
to
call
things
square
i
shall
be
satisfied
if
he
is
meanwhile
i
devote
my
successful
plan
to
the
uses
of
all
who
may
be
troubled
as
i
was
finding
in
their
assumed
gratitude
a
sufficient
compensation
for
my
ingenuity
thurlow
christmas
story
i
the
statement
of
henry
thurlow
author
to
george
currier
editor
of
the
idler
a
weekly
journal
of
human
i
have
always
maintained
my
dear
currier
that
if
a
man
wishes
to
be
considered
sane
and
has
any
particular
regard
for
his
reputation
as
a
he
would
better
keep
silent
as
to
the
singular
experiences
that
enter
into
his
life
i
have
had
many
such
experiences
myself
but
i
have
rarely
confided
them
in
detail
or
otherwise
to
those
about
me
because
i
know
that
even
the
most
trustful
of
my
friends
would
regard
them
merely
as
the
outcome
of
an
imagination
unrestrained
by
conscience
or
of
a
gradually
weakening
mind
subject
to
hallucinations
i
know
them
to
be
true
but
until
edison
or
some
other
modern
wizard
has
invented
a
strong
enough
to
lay
bare
the
secrets
of
the
mind
and
conscience
of
man
i
can
not
prove
to
others
that
they
are
not
pure
fabrications
or
at
least
the
conjurings
of
a
diseased
fancy
for
instance
no
man
would
believe
me
if
i
were
to
state
to
him
the
plain
and
indisputable
fact
that
one
night
last
month
on
my
way
up
to
bed
shortly
after
midnight
having
been
neither
smoking
nor
drinking
i
saw
confronting
me
upon
the
stairs
with
the
moonlight
streaming
through
the
windows
back
of
me
lighting
up
its
face
a
figure
in
which
i
recognized
my
very
self
in
every
form
and
feature
i
might
describe
the
chill
of
terror
that
struck
to
the
very
marrow
of
my
bones
and
wellnigh
forced
me
to
stagger
backward
down
the
stairs
as
i
noticed
in
the
face
of
this
confronting
figure
every
indication
of
all
the
bad
qualities
which
i
know
myself
to
possess
of
every
evil
instinct
which
by
no
easy
effort
i
have
repressed
heretofore
and
realized
that
that
was
as
far
as
i
knew
entirely
independent
of
my
true
self
in
which
i
hope
at
least
the
moral
has
made
an
honest
fight
against
the
immoral
always
i
might
describe
this
chill
i
say
as
vividly
as
i
felt
it
at
that
moment
but
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
do
so
because
however
realistic
it
might
prove
as
a
bit
of
description
no
man
would
believe
that
the
incident
really
happened
and
yet
it
did
happen
as
truly
as
i
write
and
it
has
happened
a
dozen
times
since
and
i
am
certain
that
it
will
happen
many
times
again
though
i
would
give
all
that
i
possess
to
be
assured
that
never
again
should
that
disquieting
creation
of
mind
or
matter
whichever
it
may
be
cross
my
path
the
experience
has
made
me
afraid
almost
to
be
alone
and
i
have
found
myself
unconsciously
and
uneasily
glancing
at
my
face
in
mirrors
in
the
of
on
the
shopping
streets
of
the
city
fearful
lest
i
should
find
some
of
those
evil
traits
which
i
have
struggled
to
keep
under
and
have
kept
under
so
far
cropping
out
there
where
all
the
world
all
world
can
see
and
wonder
at
having
known
me
always
as
a
man
of
right
doing
and
right
feeling
many
a
time
in
the
night
the
thought
has
come
to
me
with
prostrating
force
what
if
that
thing
were
to
be
seen
and
recognized
by
others
myself
and
yet
not
my
whole
self
my
unworthy
self
unrestrained
and
yet
recognizable
as
henry
thurlow
i
have
also
kept
silent
as
to
that
strange
condition
of
affairs
which
has
tortured
me
in
my
sleep
for
the
past
year
and
a
half
no
one
but
myself
has
until
this
writing
known
that
for
that
period
of
time
i
have
had
a
continuous
logical
a
life
so
vivid
and
so
dreadfully
real
to
me
that
i
have
found
myself
at
times
wondering
which
of
the
two
lives
i
was
living
and
which
i
was
dreaming
a
life
in
which
that
other
wicked
self
has
dominated
and
forced
me
to
a
career
of
shame
and
horror
a
life
which
being
taken
up
every
time
i
sleep
where
it
ceased
with
the
awakening
from
a
previous
sleep
has
made
me
fear
to
close
my
eyes
in
forgetfulness
when
others
are
near
at
hand
lest
sleeping
i
shall
let
fall
some
speech
that
striking
on
their
ears
shall
lead
them
to
believe
that
in
secret
there
is
some
wicked
mystery
connected
with
my
life
it
would
be
of
no
use
for
me
to
tell
these
things
it
would
merely
serve
to
make
my
family
and
my
friends
uneasy
about
me
if
they
were
told
in
their
awful
detail
and
so
i
have
kept
silent
about
them
to
you
alone
and
now
for
the
first
time
have
i
hinted
as
to
the
troubles
which
have
oppressed
me
for
many
days
and
to
you
they
are
confided
only
because
of
the
demand
you
have
made
that
i
explain
to
you
the
extraordinary
complication
in
which
the
christmas
story
sent
you
last
week
has
involved
me
you
know
that
i
am
a
man
of
dignity
that
i
am
not
a
and
a
lover
of
childish
tricks
and
knowing
that
your
friendship
at
least
should
have
restrained
your
tongue
and
pen
when
through
the
former
on
wednesday
you
accused
me
of
perpetrating
a
trifling
and
to
you
excessively
embarrassing
practical
joke
a
charge
which
at
the
moment
i
was
too
overcome
to
refute
and
through
the
latter
on
thursday
you
reiterated
the
accusation
coupled
with
a
demand
for
an
explanation
of
my
conduct
satisfactory
to
yourself
or
my
immediate
resignation
from
the
staff
of
the
to
explain
is
difficult
for
i
am
certain
that
you
will
find
the
explanation
too
improbable
for
credence
but
explain
i
must
the
alternative
that
of
resigning
from
your
staff
affects
not
only
my
own
welfare
but
that
of
my
children
who
must
be
provided
for
and
if
my
post
with
you
is
taken
from
me
then
are
all
resources
gone
i
have
not
the
courage
to
face
dismissal
for
i
have
not
sufficient
confidence
in
my
powers
to
please
elsewhere
to
make
me
easy
in
my
mind
or
if
i
could
please
elsewhere
the
certainty
of
finding
the
immediate
employment
of
my
talents
which
is
necessary
to
me
in
view
of
the
at
present
overcrowded
condition
of
the
literary
field
to
explain
then
my
seeming
jest
at
your
expense
hopeless
as
it
appears
to
be
is
my
task
and
to
do
so
as
completely
as
i
can
let
me
go
back
to
the
very
beginning
in
august
you
informed
me
that
you
would
expect
me
to
provide
as
i
have
heretofore
been
in
the
habit
of
doing
a
story
for
the
christmas
issue
of
the
that
a
certain
position
in
the
make
was
reserved
for
me
and
that
you
had
already
taken
steps
to
advertise
the
fact
that
the
story
would
appear
i
undertook
the
commission
and
upon
seven
different
occasions
set
about
putting
the
narrative
into
shape
i
found
great
difficulty
however
in
doing
so
for
some
reason
or
other
i
could
not
concentrate
my
mind
upon
the
work
no
sooner
would
i
start
in
on
one
story
than
a
better
one
in
my
estimation
would
suggest
itself
to
me
and
all
the
labor
expended
on
the
story
already
begun
would
be
cast
aside
and
the
new
story
set
in
motion
ideas
were
plenty
enough
but
to
put
them
properly
upon
paper
seemed
beyond
my
powers
one
story
however
i
did
finish
but
after
it
had
come
back
to
me
from
my
typewriter
i
read
it
and
was
filled
with
consternation
to
discover
that
it
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
mass
of
jumbled
sentences
conveying
no
idea
to
the
mind
a
story
which
had
seemed
to
me
in
the
writing
to
be
coherent
had
returned
to
me
as
a
mere
bit
of
incoherence
formless
without
ideas
a
bit
of
raving
it
was
then
that
i
went
to
you
and
told
you
as
you
remember
that
i
was
worn
out
and
needed
a
month
of
absolute
rest
which
you
granted
i
left
my
work
wholly
and
went
into
the
wilderness
where
i
could
be
entirely
free
from
everything
suggesting
labor
and
where
no
summons
back
to
town
could
reach
me
i
fished
and
hunted
i
slept
and
although
as
i
have
already
said
in
my
sleep
i
found
myself
leading
a
life
that
was
not
only
not
to
my
taste
but
horrible
to
me
in
many
particulars
i
was
able
at
the
end
of
my
vacation
to
come
back
to
town
greatly
refreshed
and
as
far
as
my
feelings
went
ready
to
undertake
any
amount
of
work
for
two
or
three
days
after
my
return
i
was
busy
with
other
things
on
the
fourth
day
after
my
arrival
you
came
to
me
and
said
that
the
story
must
be
finished
at
the
very
latest
by
october
and
i
assured
you
that
you
should
have
it
by
that
time
that
night
i
set
about
it
i
mapped
it
out
incident
by
incident
and
before
starting
up
to
bed
had
actually
written
some
twelve
or
fifteen
hundred
words
of
the
opening
chapter
it
was
to
be
told
in
four
chapters
when
i
had
gone
thus
far
i
experienced
a
slight
return
of
one
of
my
nervous
chills
and
on
consulting
my
watch
discovered
that
it
was
after
midnight
which
was
a
sufficient
explanation
of
my
nervousness
i
was
merely
tired
i
arranged
my
manuscripts
on
my
table
so
that
i
might
easily
take
up
the
work
the
following
morning
i
locked
up
the
windows
and
doors
turned
out
the
lights
and
proceeded
to
my
room
illustration
face
to
face
was
then
that
i
first
came
face
to
face
with
myself
that
other
self
in
which
i
recognized
developed
to
the
full
every
bit
of
my
capacity
for
an
evil
conceive
of
the
situation
if
you
can
imagine
the
horror
of
it
and
then
ask
yourself
if
it
was
likely
that
when
next
morning
came
i
could
by
any
possibility
bring
myself
to
my
in
fit
condition
to
prepare
for
you
anything
at
all
worthy
of
publication
in
the
i
tried
i
implore
you
to
believe
that
i
did
not
hold
lightly
the
responsibilities
of
the
commission
you
had
intrusted
to
my
hands
you
must
know
that
if
any
of
your
writers
has
a
full
appreciation
of
the
difficulties
which
are
strewn
along
the
path
of
an
editor
who
have
myself
had
an
editorial
experience
have
it
and
so
would
not
in
the
nature
of
things
do
anything
to
add
to
your
troubles
you
can
not
but
believe
that
i
have
made
an
honest
effort
to
fulfil
my
promise
to
you
but
it
was
useless
and
for
a
week
after
that
visitation
was
it
useless
for
me
to
attempt
the
work
at
the
end
of
the
week
i
felt
better
and
again
i
started
in
and
the
story
developed
satisfactorily
until
came
again
that
figure
which
was
my
own
figure
that
face
which
was
the
evil
counterpart
of
my
own
countenance
again
rose
up
before
me
and
once
more
was
i
plunged
into
hopelessness
thus
matters
went
on
until
the
day
of
october
when
i
received
your
peremptory
message
that
the
story
must
be
forthcoming
the
following
day
needless
to
tell
you
that
it
was
not
forthcoming
but
what
i
must
tell
you
since
you
do
not
know
it
is
that
on
the
evening
of
the
day
of
october
a
strange
thing
happened
to
me
and
in
the
narration
of
that
incident
which
i
almost
despair
of
your
believing
lies
my
explanation
of
the
discovery
of
october
which
has
placed
my
position
with
you
in
peril
at
seven
on
the
evening
of
october
i
was
sitting
in
my
library
trying
to
write
i
was
alone
my
wife
and
children
had
gone
away
on
a
visit
to
massachusetts
for
a
week
i
had
just
finished
my
cigar
and
had
taken
my
pen
in
hand
when
my
front
bell
rang
our
maid
who
is
usually
prompt
in
answering
summonses
of
this
nature
apparently
did
not
hear
the
bell
for
she
did
not
respond
to
its
clanging
again
the
bell
rang
and
still
did
it
remain
unanswered
until
finally
at
the
third
ringing
i
went
to
the
door
myself
on
opening
it
i
saw
standing
before
me
a
man
of
i
should
say
fifty
odd
years
of
age
tall
slender
and
clad
in
sombre
black
he
was
entirely
unknown
to
me
i
had
never
seen
him
before
but
he
had
about
him
such
an
air
of
pleasantness
and
wholesomeness
that
i
instinctively
felt
glad
to
see
him
without
knowing
why
or
whence
he
had
come
does
thurlow
live
here
he
asked
you
must
excuse
me
for
going
into
what
may
seem
to
you
to
be
petty
details
but
by
a
perfectly
circumstantial
account
of
all
that
happened
that
evening
alone
can
i
hope
to
give
a
semblance
of
truth
to
my
story
and
that
it
must
be
truthful
i
realize
as
painfully
as
you
do
i
am
thurlow
i
replied
henry
thurlow
the
author
he
said
with
a
surprised
look
upon
his
face
yes
said
i
and
then
impelled
by
the
strange
appearance
of
surprise
on
the
man
countenance
i
added
do
i
look
like
an
author
he
laughed
and
candidly
admitted
that
i
was
not
the
kind
of
looking
man
he
had
expected
to
find
from
reading
my
books
and
then
he
entered
the
house
in
response
to
my
invitation
that
he
do
so
i
ushered
him
into
my
library
and
after
asking
him
to
be
seated
inquired
as
to
his
business
with
me
his
answer
was
gratifying
at
least
he
replied
that
he
had
been
a
reader
of
my
writings
for
a
number
of
years
and
that
for
some
time
past
he
had
had
a
great
desire
not
to
say
curiosity
to
meet
me
and
tell
me
how
much
he
had
enjoyed
certain
of
my
stories
i
a
great
devourer
of
books
thurlow
he
said
and
i
have
taken
the
keenest
delight
in
reading
your
verses
and
humorous
sketches
i
may
go
further
and
say
to
you
that
you
have
helped
me
over
many
a
hard
place
in
my
life
by
your
work
at
times
when
i
have
felt
myself
worn
out
with
my
business
or
face
to
face
with
some
knotty
problem
in
my
career
i
have
found
much
relief
in
picking
up
and
reading
your
books
at
random
they
have
helped
me
to
forget
my
weariness
or
my
knotty
problems
for
the
time
being
and
finding
myself
in
this
town
i
resolved
to
call
upon
you
this
evening
and
thank
you
for
all
that
you
have
done
for
me
thereupon
we
became
involved
in
a
general
discussion
of
literary
men
and
their
works
and
i
found
that
my
visitor
certainly
did
have
a
pretty
thorough
knowledge
of
what
has
been
produced
by
the
writers
of
i
was
quite
won
over
to
him
by
his
simplicity
as
well
as
attracted
to
him
by
his
kindly
opinion
of
my
own
efforts
and
i
did
my
best
to
entertain
him
showing
him
a
few
of
my
little
literary
treasures
in
the
way
of
autograph
letters
photographs
and
presentation
copies
of
books
from
the
authors
themselves
from
this
we
drifted
naturally
and
easily
into
a
talk
on
the
methods
of
work
adopted
by
literary
men
he
asked
me
many
questions
as
to
my
own
methods
and
when
i
had
in
a
measure
outlined
to
him
the
manner
of
life
which
i
had
adopted
telling
him
of
my
days
at
home
how
little
detail
i
had
he
seemed
much
interested
with
the
picture
indeed
i
painted
the
picture
of
my
daily
routine
in
almost
too
perfect
colors
for
when
i
had
finished
he
observed
quietly
that
i
appeared
to
him
to
lead
the
ideal
life
and
added
that
he
supposed
i
knew
very
little
unhappiness
the
remark
recalled
to
me
the
dreadful
reality
that
through
some
perversity
of
fate
i
was
doomed
to
visitations
of
an
uncanny
order
which
were
practically
destroying
my
usefulness
in
my
profession
and
my
sole
financial
resource
well
i
replied
as
my
mind
reverted
to
the
unpleasant
predicament
in
which
i
found
myself
i
ca
say
that
i
know
little
unhappiness
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
know
a
great
deal
of
that
undesirable
thing
at
the
present
moment
i
am
very
much
embarrassed
through
my
absolute
inability
to
fulfil
a
contract
into
which
i
have
entered
and
which
should
have
been
filled
this
morning
i
was
due
with
a
christmas
story
the
presses
are
waiting
for
it
and
i
am
utterly
unable
to
write
it
he
appeared
deeply
concerned
at
the
confession
i
had
hoped
indeed
that
he
might
be
sufficiently
concerned
to
take
his
departure
that
i
might
make
one
more
effort
to
write
the
promised
story
his
solicitude
however
showed
itself
in
another
way
instead
of
leaving
me
he
ventured
the
hope
that
he
might
aid
me
what
kind
of
a
story
is
it
to
be
he
asked
oh
the
usual
ghostly
tale
i
said
with
a
dash
of
the
christmas
flavor
thrown
in
here
and
there
to
make
it
suitable
to
the
season
ah
he
observed
and
you
find
your
vein
worked
out
it
was
a
direct
and
perhaps
an
impertinent
question
but
i
thought
it
best
to
answer
it
and
to
answer
it
as
well
without
giving
him
any
clew
as
to
the
real
facts
i
could
not
very
well
take
an
entire
stranger
into
my
confidence
and
describe
to
him
the
extraordinary
encounters
i
was
having
with
an
uncanny
other
self
he
would
not
have
believed
the
truth
hence
i
told
him
an
untruth
and
assented
to
his
proposition
yes
i
replied
the
vein
is
worked
out
i
have
written
ghost
stories
for
years
now
serious
and
comic
and
i
am
at
the
end
of
my
tether
compelled
to
move
forward
and
yet
held
back
that
accounts
for
it
he
said
simply
when
i
first
saw
you
to
at
the
door
i
could
not
believe
that
the
author
who
had
provided
me
with
so
much
merriment
could
be
so
pale
and
worn
and
seemingly
mirthless
pardon
me
thurlow
for
my
lack
of
consideration
when
i
told
you
that
you
did
not
appear
as
i
had
expected
to
find
you
i
smiled
my
forgiveness
and
he
continued
it
may
be
he
said
with
a
show
of
hesitation
it
may
be
that
i
have
come
not
altogether
inopportunely
perhaps
i
can
help
you
i
smiled
again
i
should
be
most
grateful
if
you
could
i
said
but
you
doubt
my
ability
to
do
so
he
put
in
oh
well
yes
of
course
you
do
and
why
should
you
nevertheless
i
have
noticed
this
at
times
when
i
have
been
baffled
in
my
work
a
mere
hint
from
another
from
one
who
knew
nothing
of
my
work
has
carried
me
on
to
a
solution
of
my
problem
i
have
read
most
of
your
writings
and
i
have
thought
over
some
of
them
many
a
time
and
i
have
even
had
ideas
for
stories
which
in
my
own
conceit
i
have
imagined
were
good
enough
for
you
and
i
have
wished
that
i
possessed
your
facility
with
the
pen
that
i
might
make
of
them
myself
what
i
thought
you
would
make
of
them
had
they
been
ideas
of
your
own
the
old
gentleman
pallid
face
reddened
as
he
said
this
and
while
i
was
hopeless
as
to
anything
of
value
resulting
from
his
ideas
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
further
his
manner
was
so
deliciously
simple
and
his
desire
to
aid
me
so
manifest
he
rattled
on
with
suggestions
for
a
some
of
them
were
good
but
none
were
new
some
were
irresistibly
funny
and
did
me
good
because
they
made
me
laugh
and
i
had
laughed
naturally
for
a
period
so
long
that
it
made
me
shudder
to
think
of
it
fearing
lest
i
should
forget
how
to
be
mirthful
finally
i
grew
tired
of
his
persistence
and
with
a
very
impatience
told
him
plainly
that
i
could
do
nothing
with
his
suggestions
thanking
him
however
for
the
spirit
of
kindliness
which
had
prompted
him
to
offer
them
he
appeared
somewhat
hurt
but
immediately
desisted
and
when
nine
came
he
rose
up
to
go
as
he
walked
to
the
door
he
seemed
to
be
undergoing
some
mental
struggle
to
which
with
a
sudden
resolve
he
finally
succumbed
for
after
having
picked
up
his
hat
and
stick
and
donned
his
overcoat
he
turned
to
me
and
said
thurlow
i
do
want
to
offend
you
on
the
contrary
it
is
my
dearest
wish
to
assist
you
you
have
helped
me
as
i
have
told
you
why
may
i
not
help
you
illustration
he
rattled
on
for
half
an
hour
i
assure
you
sir
i
began
when
he
interrupted
me
one
moment
please
he
said
putting
his
hand
into
the
inside
pocket
of
his
black
coat
and
extracting
from
it
an
envelope
addressed
to
me
let
me
finish
it
is
the
whim
of
one
who
has
an
affection
for
you
for
ten
years
i
have
secretly
been
at
work
myself
on
a
story
it
is
a
short
one
but
it
has
seemed
good
to
me
i
had
a
double
object
in
seeking
you
out
i
wanted
not
only
to
see
you
but
to
read
my
story
to
you
no
one
knows
that
i
have
written
it
i
had
intended
it
as
a
surprise
to
my
to
my
friends
i
had
hoped
to
have
it
published
somewhere
and
i
had
come
here
to
seek
your
advice
in
the
matter
it
is
a
story
which
i
have
written
and
rewritten
and
rewritten
time
and
time
again
in
my
leisure
moments
during
the
ten
years
past
as
i
have
told
you
it
is
not
likely
that
i
shall
ever
write
another
i
am
proud
of
having
done
it
but
i
should
be
prouder
yet
if
it
if
it
could
in
some
way
help
you
i
leave
it
with
you
sir
to
print
or
to
destroy
and
if
you
print
it
to
see
it
in
type
will
be
enough
for
me
to
see
your
name
signed
to
it
will
be
a
matter
of
pride
to
me
no
one
will
ever
be
the
wiser
for
as
i
say
no
one
knows
i
have
written
it
and
i
promise
you
that
no
one
shall
know
of
it
if
you
decide
to
do
as
i
not
only
suggest
but
ask
you
to
do
no
one
would
believe
me
after
it
has
appeared
as
even
if
i
should
forget
my
promise
and
claim
it
as
my
own
take
it
it
is
yours
you
are
entitled
to
it
as
a
slight
measure
of
repayment
for
the
debt
of
gratitude
i
owe
you
he
pressed
the
manuscript
into
my
hands
and
before
i
could
reply
had
opened
the
door
and
disappeared
into
the
darkness
of
the
street
i
rushed
to
the
sidewalk
and
shouted
out
to
him
to
return
but
i
might
as
well
have
saved
my
breath
and
spared
the
neighborhood
for
there
was
no
answer
holding
his
story
in
my
hand
i
the
house
and
walked
back
into
my
library
where
sitting
and
reflecting
upon
the
curious
interview
i
realized
for
the
first
time
that
i
was
in
entire
ignorance
as
to
my
visitor
name
and
address
illustration
the
demon
vanished
i
opened
the
envelope
hoping
to
find
them
but
they
were
not
there
the
envelope
contained
merely
a
finely
written
manuscript
of
thirty
odd
pages
unsigned
and
then
i
read
the
story
when
i
began
it
was
with
a
upon
my
lips
and
with
a
feeling
that
i
was
wasting
my
time
the
smile
soon
faded
however
after
reading
the
first
paragraph
there
was
no
question
of
wasted
time
the
story
was
a
masterpiece
it
is
needless
to
say
to
you
that
i
am
not
a
man
of
enthusiasms
it
is
difficult
to
arouse
that
emotion
in
my
breast
but
upon
this
occasion
i
yielded
to
a
force
too
great
for
me
to
resist
i
have
read
the
tales
of
hoffmann
and
of
poe
the
wondrous
romances
of
de
la
motte
fouque
the
unfortunately
tales
of
the
lamented
the
weird
tales
of
writers
of
all
tongues
have
been
thoroughly
sifted
by
me
in
the
course
of
my
reading
and
i
say
to
you
now
that
in
the
whole
of
my
life
i
never
read
one
story
one
paragraph
one
line
that
could
approach
in
vivid
delineation
in
weirdness
of
conception
in
anything
in
any
quality
which
goes
to
make
up
the
truly
great
story
that
story
which
came
into
my
hands
as
i
have
told
you
i
read
it
once
and
was
amazed
i
read
it
a
second
time
and
was
tempted
it
was
mine
the
writer
himself
had
authorized
me
to
treat
it
as
if
it
were
my
own
had
voluntarily
sacrificed
his
own
claim
to
its
authorship
that
he
might
relieve
me
of
my
very
pressing
embarrassment
not
only
this
he
had
almost
intimated
that
in
putting
my
name
to
his
work
i
should
be
doing
him
a
favor
why
not
do
so
then
i
asked
myself
and
immediately
my
better
self
rejected
the
idea
as
impossible
how
could
i
put
out
as
my
own
another
man
work
and
retain
my
self
i
resolved
on
another
and
better
course
to
send
you
the
story
in
lieu
of
my
own
with
a
full
statement
of
the
circumstances
under
which
it
had
come
into
my
possession
when
that
demon
rose
up
out
of
the
floor
at
my
side
this
time
more
evil
of
aspect
than
before
more
commanding
in
its
manner
with
a
groan
i
shrank
back
into
the
cushions
of
my
chair
and
by
passing
my
hands
over
my
eyes
tried
to
obliterate
forever
the
offending
sight
but
it
was
useless
the
uncanny
thing
approached
me
and
as
truly
as
i
write
sat
upon
the
edge
of
my
couch
where
for
the
first
time
it
addressed
me
fool
it
said
how
can
you
hesitate
here
is
your
position
you
have
made
a
contract
which
must
be
filled
you
are
already
behind
and
in
a
hopeless
mental
state
even
granting
that
between
this
and
morning
you
could
put
together
the
necessary
number
of
words
to
fill
the
space
allotted
to
you
what
kind
of
a
thing
do
you
think
that
story
would
make
it
would
be
a
mere
raving
like
that
other
precious
effort
of
august
the
public
if
by
some
odd
chance
it
ever
reached
them
would
think
your
mind
was
utterly
gone
your
reputation
would
go
with
that
verdict
on
the
other
hand
if
you
do
not
have
the
story
ready
by
your
hold
on
the
will
be
destroyed
they
have
their
announcements
printed
and
your
name
and
portrait
appear
among
those
of
the
prominent
contributors
do
you
suppose
the
editor
and
publisher
will
look
leniently
upon
your
failure
considering
my
past
record
yes
i
replied
i
have
never
yet
broken
a
promise
to
them
which
is
precisely
the
reason
why
they
will
be
severe
with
you
you
who
have
been
regarded
as
one
of
the
few
men
who
can
do
almost
any
kind
of
literary
work
at
will
you
of
whom
it
is
said
that
your
are
on
tap
will
they
be
lenient
with
bah
ca
you
see
that
the
very
fact
of
your
invariable
readiness
heretofore
is
going
to
make
your
present
unreadiness
a
thing
incomprehensible
then
what
shall
i
do
i
asked
if
i
ca
i
ca
that
is
all
you
can
there
is
the
story
in
your
hands
think
what
it
will
do
for
you
it
is
one
of
the
immortal
stories
you
have
read
it
then
i
asked
have
you
yes
but
it
is
the
same
it
said
with
a
leer
and
a
contemptuous
shrug
you
and
i
are
inseparable
are
you
glad
it
added
with
a
laugh
that
grated
on
every
fibre
of
my
being
i
was
too
overwhelmed
to
reply
and
it
resumed
it
is
one
of
the
immortal
stories
we
agree
to
that
published
over
your
name
your
name
will
live
the
stuff
you
write
yourself
will
give
you
present
glory
but
when
you
have
been
dead
ten
years
people
wo
remember
your
name
even
unless
i
get
control
of
you
and
in
that
case
there
is
a
very
pretty
though
hardly
a
literary
record
in
store
for
you
again
it
laughed
harshly
and
i
buried
my
face
in
the
pillows
of
my
couch
hoping
to
find
relief
there
from
this
dreadful
vision
curious
it
said
what
you
call
your
decent
self
does
dare
look
me
in
the
eye
what
a
mistake
people
make
who
say
that
the
man
who
wo
look
you
in
the
eye
is
not
to
be
trusted
as
if
mere
brazenness
were
a
sign
of
honesty
really
the
theory
of
decency
is
the
most
amusing
thing
in
the
world
but
come
time
is
growing
short
take
that
story
the
writer
gave
it
to
you
begged
you
to
use
it
as
your
own
it
is
yours
it
will
make
your
reputation
and
save
you
with
your
publishers
how
can
you
hesitate
i
shall
not
use
it
i
cried
desperately
you
must
consider
your
children
suppose
you
lose
your
connection
with
these
publishers
of
yours
but
it
would
be
a
crime
not
a
bit
of
it
whom
do
you
rob
a
man
who
voluntarily
came
to
you
and
gave
you
that
of
which
you
rob
him
think
of
it
as
it
is
and
act
only
act
quickly
it
is
now
midnight
the
tempter
rose
up
and
walked
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
whence
while
he
pretended
to
be
looking
over
a
few
of
my
books
and
pictures
i
was
aware
he
was
eyeing
me
closely
and
gradually
compelling
me
by
sheer
force
of
will
to
do
a
thing
which
i
abhorred
and
i
i
struggled
weakly
against
the
temptation
but
gradually
little
by
little
i
yielded
and
finally
succumbed
altogether
springing
to
my
feet
i
rushed
to
the
table
seized
my
pen
and
signed
my
name
to
the
story
there
i
said
it
is
done
i
have
saved
my
position
and
made
my
reputation
and
am
now
a
thief
illustration
does
dare
to
look
me
in
the
eye
as
well
as
a
fool
said
the
other
calmly
you
do
mean
to
say
you
are
going
to
send
that
manuscript
in
as
it
is
good
lord
i
cried
what
under
heaven
have
you
been
trying
to
make
me
do
for
the
last
half
hour
act
like
a
sane
being
said
the
demon
if
you
send
that
manuscript
to
currier
he
know
in
a
minute
it
is
yours
he
knows
you
have
an
amanuensis
and
that
handwriting
is
yours
copy
it
true
i
answered
i
have
much
of
a
mind
for
details
i
will
do
as
you
say
i
did
so
i
got
out
my
pad
and
pen
and
ink
and
for
three
hours
diligently
applied
myself
to
the
task
of
copying
the
story
when
it
was
finished
i
went
over
it
carefully
made
a
few
minor
corrections
signed
it
put
it
in
an
envelope
addressed
it
to
you
stamped
it
and
went
out
to
the
on
the
corner
where
i
dropped
it
into
the
slot
and
returned
home
when
i
had
returned
to
my
library
my
visitor
was
still
there
well
it
said
i
wish
you
hurry
and
complete
this
affair
i
am
tired
and
wish
to
go
you
ca
go
too
soon
to
please
me
said
i
gathering
up
the
original
manuscripts
of
the
story
and
preparing
to
put
them
away
in
my
desk
probably
not
it
sneered
i
be
glad
to
go
too
but
i
ca
go
until
that
manuscript
is
destroyed
as
long
as
it
exists
there
is
evidence
of
your
having
appropriated
the
work
of
another
why
you
see
that
burn
it
i
ca
see
my
way
clear
in
crime
i
retorted
it
is
not
in
my
line
nevertheless
realizing
the
value
of
his
advice
i
thrust
the
pages
one
by
one
into
the
blazing
log
fire
and
watched
them
as
they
flared
and
flamed
and
grew
to
ashes
as
the
last
page
disappeared
in
the
embers
the
demon
vanished
i
was
alone
and
throwing
myself
down
for
a
moment
reflection
upon
my
couch
was
soon
lost
in
sleep
it
was
noon
when
i
again
opened
my
eyes
and
ten
minutes
after
i
awakened
your
telegraphic
summons
reached
me
come
down
at
once
was
what
you
said
and
i
went
and
then
came
the
terrible
and
yet
a
which
was
pleasing
to
me
since
it
relieved
my
conscience
you
handed
me
the
envelope
containing
the
story
did
you
send
that
was
your
question
i
did
last
night
or
rather
early
this
morning
i
mailed
it
about
three
i
replied
i
demand
an
explanation
of
your
conduct
said
you
of
what
i
asked
look
at
your
story
and
see
if
this
is
a
practical
joke
thurlow
it
a
damned
poor
one
i
opened
the
envelope
and
took
from
it
the
sheets
i
had
sent
you
of
them
were
every
one
of
them
as
blank
as
when
they
left
the
paper
you
know
the
rest
you
know
that
i
tried
to
speak
that
my
utterance
failed
me
and
that
finding
myself
unable
at
the
time
to
control
my
emotions
i
turned
and
rushed
madly
from
the
office
leaving
the
mystery
unexplained
you
know
that
you
wrote
demanding
a
satisfactory
explanation
of
the
situation
or
my
resignation
from
your
staff
this
currier
is
my
explanation
it
is
all
i
have
it
is
absolute
truth
i
beg
you
to
believe
it
for
if
you
do
not
then
is
my
condition
a
hopeless
one
you
will
ask
me
perhaps
for
a
of
the
story
which
i
thought
i
had
sent
you
it
is
my
crowning
misfortune
that
upon
that
point
my
mind
is
an
absolute
blank
i
can
not
remember
it
in
form
or
in
substance
i
have
racked
my
brains
for
some
recollection
of
some
small
portion
of
it
to
help
to
make
my
explanation
more
credible
but
alas
it
will
not
come
back
to
me
if
i
were
dishonest
i
might
fake
up
a
story
to
suit
the
purpose
but
i
am
not
dishonest
i
came
near
to
doing
an
unworthy
act
i
did
do
an
unworthy
thing
but
by
some
mysterious
provision
of
fate
my
conscience
is
cleared
of
that
be
sympathetic
currier
or
if
you
can
not
be
lenient
with
me
this
time
believe
i
implore
you
pray
let
me
hear
from
you
at
once
signed
henry
thurlow
illustration
at
your
so
called
story
and
see
ii
a
note
from
george
currier
editor
of
the
idler
to
henry
thurlow
your
explanation
has
come
to
hand
as
an
explanation
it
is
worth
the
paper
it
is
written
on
but
we
are
all
agreed
here
that
it
is
probably
the
best
bit
of
fiction
you
ever
wrote

dawson
suggests
that
you
take
another
month
up
in
the
adirondacks
you
might
put
in
your
time
writing
up
some
account
of
that
dream
you
are
leading
while
you
are
there
it
seems
to
me
there
are
possibilities
in
the
idea
the
concern
will
pay
all
expenses
what
do
you
say
signed
yours
ever
the
dampmere
mystery
dawson
wished
to
be
alone
he
had
a
tremendous
bit
of
writing
to
do
which
could
not
be
done
in
new
york
where
his
friends
were
constantly
interrupting
him
and
that
is
why
he
had
taken
the
little
cottage
at
dampmere
for
the
early
spring
months
the
cottage
just
suited
him
it
was
remote
from
the
village
of
dampmere
and
the
rental
was
suspiciously
reasonable
he
could
have
had
a
years
lease
of
it
for
nothing
had
he
chosen
to
ask
for
it
and
would
promise
to
keep
the
premises
in
repair
but
he
was
not
aware
of
that
fact
when
he
made
his
arrangements
with
the
agent
indeed
there
was
a
great
deal
that
dawson
was
not
aware
of
when
he
took
the
place
if
there
had
been
he
never
would
have
thought
of
going
there
and
this
story
would
not
have
been
written
it
was
late
in
march
when
with
his
chinese
servant
and
his
mastiff
he
entered
into
possession
and
began
the
writing
of
the
story
he
had
in
mind
it
was
to
be
the
effort
of
his
life
people
reading
it
would
forget
thackeray
and
everybody
else
and
would
furthermore
never
wish
to
see
another
book
it
was
to
be
the
literature
of
all
time
past
and
present
and
future
in
it
all
previous
work
was
to
be
forgotten
all
future
work
was
to
be
rendered
unnecessary
for
three
weeks
everything
went
smoothly
enough
and
the
work
upon
the
great
story
progressed
to
the
author
satisfaction
but
as
easter
approached
something
queer
seemed
to
develop
in
the
dampmere
cottage
it
was
undefinable
intangible
invisible
but
it
was
there
dawson
hair
would
not
stay
down
when
he
rose
up
in
the
morning
he
would
find
every
single
hair
on
his
head
standing
erect
and
plaster
it
as
he
would
with
his
brushes
dipped
in
water
it
could
not
be
induced
to
lie
down
again
more
inconvenient
than
this
his
silken
mustache
was
affected
in
the
same
way
so
that
instead
of
drooping
in
a
soft
fascinating
curl
over
his
lip
it
also
rose
up
like
a
row
of
bayonets
and
lay
flat
against
either
side
of
his
nose
and
with
this
singular
hirsute
affliction
there
came
into
heart
a
feeling
of
apprehension
over
something
he
knew
not
what
that
speedily
developed
into
an
uncontrollable
terror
that
pervaded
his
whole
being
and
more
thoroughly
destroyed
his
ability
to
work
upon
his
immortal
story
than
ten
inconsiderate
new
york
friends
dropping
in
on
him
in
his
busy
hours
could
possibly
have
done
what
the
dickens
is
the
matter
with
me
he
said
to
himself
as
for
the
sixteenth
time
he
brushed
his
rebellious
locks
what
has
come
over
my
hair
and
what
under
the
sun
am
i
afraid
of
the
idea
of
a
man
of
my
size
looking
under
the
bed
every
night
for
for
something
burglar
spook
or
what
i
do
know
waking
at
midnight
shivering
with
fear
walking
in
the
broad
light
of
day
filled
with
terror
by
jove
i
almost
wish
i
was
chung
lee
down
in
the
kitchen
who
goes
about
his
business
undisturbed
illustration
it
was
to
be
the
effort
of
his
life
having
said
this
dawson
looked
about
him
nervously
if
he
had
expected
a
dagger
to
be
plunged
into
his
back
by
an
unseen
foe
he
could
not
have
looked
around
more
anxiously
and
then
he
fled
actually
fled
in
terror
into
the
kitchen
where
chung
lee
was
preparing
his
dinner
chung
was
only
a
chinaman
but
he
was
a
living
creature
and
dawson
was
afraid
to
be
alone
well
chung
he
said
as
affably
as
he
could
this
is
a
pleasant
change
from
new
york
eh
plutty
good
replied
chung
with
a
vacant
stare
at
the
pantry
door
me
likes
noo
lork
allee
same
dampeemere
kind
of
flunny
mister
dawson
funny
chung
queried
dawson
observing
for
the
first
time
that
the
chinaman
queue
stood
up
as
straight
as
a
garden
stake
and
almost
scraped
the
ceiling
as
its
owner
moved
about
funny
yeppee
flunny
returned
chung
with
a
shiver
me
no
likee
me
flightened
oh
come
said
dawson
with
an
affected
lightness
what
are
you
afraid
of
slumting
said
chung
do
know
what
go
to
bled
no
sleepee
pigtail
no
stay
down
heart
go
thump
allee
night
by
jove
thought
dawson
he
got
it
too
evlyting
flunny
here
resumed
chung
jack
he
no
likee
too
jack
was
the
mastiff
what
the
matter
with
jack
queried
dawson
you
do
mean
to
say
jack
afraid
do
know
if
he
said
chung
he
growl
most
time
clearly
there
was
no
comfort
for
dawson
here
to
rid
him
of
his
fears
it
was
evident
that
chung
could
be
of
no
assistance
and
chung
feeling
that
even
jack
was
affected
by
the
uncanny
something
was
by
no
means
reassuring
dawson
went
out
into
the
yard
and
whistled
for
the
dog
and
in
a
moment
the
magnificent
animal
came
bounding
up
dawson
patted
him
on
the
back
but
jack
instead
of
rejoicing
as
was
his
wont
over
this
token
of
his
master
affection
gave
a
yelp
of
pain
which
was
quite
in
accord
with
dawson
own
feelings
for
gentle
though
the
pat
was
his
hand
after
it
felt
as
though
he
had
pressed
it
upon
a
bunch
of
needles
what
the
matter
old
fellow
said
dawson
ruefully
rubbing
the
palm
of
his
hand
did
i
hurt
you
the
dog
tried
to
wag
his
tail
but
unavailingly
and
dawson
was
again
filled
with
consternation
to
observe
that
even
as
queue
stood
high
even
as
his
own
hair
would
not
lie
down
so
it
was
with
jack
soft
furry
skin
every
hair
on
it
was
erect
from
the
tip
of
the
poor
beast
nose
to
the
end
of
his
tail
and
so
stiff
withal
that
when
it
was
pressed
from
without
it
pricked
the
dog
within
there
seems
to
be
some
starch
in
the
air
of
dampmere
said
dawson
thoughtfully
as
he
turned
and
walked
slowly
into
the
house
i
wonder
what
the
deuce
it
all
means
and
then
he
sought
his
desk
and
tried
to
write
but
he
soon
found
that
he
could
not
possibly
concentrate
his
mind
upon
his
work
he
was
continually
oppressed
by
the
feeling
that
he
was
not
alone
at
one
moment
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
a
pair
of
eyes
peering
at
him
from
the
northeast
corner
of
the
room
but
as
soon
as
he
turned
his
own
anxious
gaze
in
that
direction
the
difficulty
seemed
to
lie
in
the
southwest
corner
bah
he
cried
starting
up
and
stamping
his
foot
angrily
upon
the
floor
the
idea
i
charles
dawson
a
man
of
the
world
scared
by
by
well
by
nothing
i
do
believe
in
ghosts
and
yet
at
times
i
do
believe
that
this
house
is
haunted
my
hair
seems
to
feel
the
same
way
it
stands
up
like
stubble
in
a
and
one
might
as
well
try
to
brush
the
one
as
the
other
at
this
rate
get
done
i
go
to
town
and
see
bronson
there
something
the
matter
with
me
so
off
dawson
went
to
town
i
suppose
bronson
will
think
i
a
fool
but
i
can
prove
all
i
say
by
my
hair
he
said
as
he
rang
the
doctor
bell
he
was
instantly
admitted
and
shortly
after
describing
his
symptoms
he
called
the
doctor
attention
to
his
hair
if
he
had
pinned
his
faith
to
this
he
showed
that
his
faith
was
misplaced
for
when
the
doctor
came
to
examine
it
dawson
hair
was
lying
down
as
softly
as
it
ever
had
the
doctor
looked
at
dawson
for
a
moment
and
then
with
a
dry
cough
he
said
illustration
when
he
rose
up
in
the
morning
he
would
find
every
single
hair
on
his
head
standing
erect
dawson
i
can
conclude
one
of
two
things
from
what
you
tell
me
either
dampmere
is
haunted
which
you
and
i
as
sane
men
believe
in
these
days
or
else
you
are
playing
a
practical
joke
on
me
now
i
do
mind
a
practical
joke
at
the
club
my
dear
fellow
but
here
in
my
office
hours
i
ca
afford
the
time
to
like
anything
of
the
sort
i
speak
frankly
with
you
old
fellow
i
have
to
i
hate
to
do
it
but
after
all
you
brought
it
on
yourself
doctor
dawson
rejoined
i
believe
i
a
sick
man
else
this
thing
would
have
happened
i
solemnly
assure
you
that
i
come
to
you
because
i
wanted
a
prescription
and
because
i
believe
myself
badly
off
you
carry
it
off
well
dawson
said
the
doctor
severely
but
i
prescribe
go
back
to
dampmere
right
away
and
when
you
seen
the
ghost
telegraph
me
and
i
come
down
with
this
bronson
bowed
dawson
out
and
the
latter
poor
fellow
soon
found
himself
on
the
street
utterly
disconsolate
he
could
not
blame
bronson
he
could
understand
how
bronson
could
come
to
believe
that
with
his
hair
as
the
only
witness
to
his
woes
and
a
witness
that
failed
him
at
the
crucial
moment
bronson
should
regard
his
visit
as
the
outcome
of
some
club
wager
in
many
of
which
he
had
been
involved
previously
i
guess
his
advice
is
good
said
he
as
he
walked
along
i
go
back
right
away
but
meanwhile
i
get
billie
perkins
to
come
out
and
spend
the
night
with
me
and
we
try
it
on
him
i
ask
him
out
for
a
few
days
suffice
it
to
say
that
perkins
accepted
and
that
night
found
the
two
eating
supper
together
outwardly
serene
perkins
was
quite
interested
when
chung
brought
in
the
supper
wears
his
queue
pompadour
i
see
he
said
as
he
glanced
at
chung
extraordinary
illustration
his
queue
pompadour
i
see
yes
said
dawson
shortly
you
wear
your
hair
that
way
yourself
he
added
for
he
was
pleased
as
well
as
astonished
to
note
that
perkins
hair
was
manifesting
an
upward
tendency
nonsense
said
perkins
it
flat
as
a
comic
paper
look
at
yourself
in
the
glass
said
dawson
perkins
obeyed
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
his
hair
was
rising
he
started
back
uneasily
dawson
he
cried
what
is
it
i
felt
queer
ever
since
i
entered
your
front
door
and
i
assure
you
i
been
wondering
why
you
wore
your
mustache
like
a
pirate
all
the
evening
i
ca
account
for
it
i
got
the
creeps
myself
said
dawson
and
then
he
told
perkins
all
that
i
have
told
you
let
let
go
back
to
new
york
said
perkins
ca
replied
dawson
no
train
then
said
perkins
with
a
shiver
let
go
to
bed
the
two
men
retired
dawson
to
the
room
directly
over
the
parlor
perkins
to
the
apartment
back
of
it
for
company
they
left
the
gas
burning
and
in
a
short
time
were
fast
asleep
an
hour
later
dawson
awakened
with
a
start
two
things
oppressed
him
to
the
very
core
of
his
being
first
the
gas
was
out
and
second
perkins
had
unmistakably
groaned
he
leaped
from
his
bed
and
hastened
into
the
next
room
perkins
he
cried
are
you
ill
is
that
you
dawson
came
a
voice
from
the
darkness
yes
did
did
you
put
out
the
gas
no
are
you
ill
no
but
i
deuced
uncomfortable
what
this
mattress
stuffed
with
needles
needles
no
it
a
hair
mattress
is
it
all
right
not
by
a
great
deal
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
sleeping
on
a
porcupine
light
up
the
gas
and
let
see
what
the
trouble
is
dawson
did
as
he
was
told
wondering
meanwhile
why
the
gas
had
gone
out
no
one
had
turned
it
out
and
yet
the
key
was
unmistakably
turned
and
what
was
worse
on
ripping
open
perkins
mattress
a
most
disquieting
state
of
affairs
was
disclosed
single
hair
in
it
was
standing
on
end
a
later
four
figures
were
to
be
seen
wending
their
way
northward
through
the
darkness
two
men
a
huge
mastiff
and
a
chinaman
the
group
was
made
up
of
dawson
his
guest
his
servant
and
his
dog
dampmere
was
impossible
there
was
no
train
until
morning
but
not
one
of
them
was
willing
to
remain
a
moment
longer
at
dampmere
and
so
they
had
to
walk
what
do
you
suppose
it
was
asked
perkins
as
they
left
the
third
mile
behind
them
i
do
know
said
dawson
but
it
must
be
something
terrible
i
do
mind
a
ghost
that
will
make
the
hair
of
living
beings
stand
on
end
but
a
nameless
invisible
something
that
affects
a
mattress
that
way
has
a
terrible
potency
that
i
have
no
desire
to
combat
it
a
mystery
and
as
a
rule
i
like
mysteries
but
the
mystery
of
dampmere
i
rather
let
alone
do
say
a
word
about
the
ah
the
mattress
charlie
said
perkins
after
awhile
the
fellows
never
believe
it
no
i
was
thinking
that
very
same
thing
said
dawson
and
they
were
both
true
to
dawson
resolve
which
is
possibly
why
the
mystery
of
dampmere
has
never
been
solved
if
any
of
my
readers
can
furnish
a
solution
i
wish
they
would
do
so
for
i
am
very
much
interested
in
the
case
and
i
truly
hate
to
leave
a
story
of
this
kind
in
so
unsatisfactory
a
condition
a
ghost
story
without
any
solution
strikes
me
as
being
about
as
useful
as
a
house
without
a
roof
carleton
barker
first
and
second
my
first
meeting
with
carleton
barker
was
a
singular
one
a
friend
and
i
in
august
were
doing
the
english
lake
district
on
foot
when
on
nearing
the
base
of
the
famous
mount
skiddaw
we
observed
on
the
road
some
distance
ahead
of
us
limping
along
and
apparently
in
great
pain
the
man
whose
subsequent
career
so
sorely
puzzled
us
noting
his
very
evident
distress
parton
and
i
quickened
our
pace
and
soon
caught
up
with
the
stranger
who
as
we
reached
his
side
fell
forward
upon
his
face
in
a
fainting
condition
as
well
he
might
for
not
only
must
he
have
suffered
great
agony
from
a
sprained
ankle
but
inspection
of
his
person
disclosed
a
most
extraordinary
gash
in
his
right
arm
made
apparently
with
a
sharp
knife
and
which
was
bleeding
most
profusely
to
stanch
the
flow
of
blood
was
our
first
care
and
parton
having
recently
been
graduated
in
medicine
made
short
work
of
relieving
the
sufferer
pain
from
his
ankle
bandaging
it
about
and
applying
such
soothing
properties
as
he
had
in
his
knapsack
properties
by
the
way
with
which
knowing
the
small
perils
to
which
pedestrians
everywhere
are
liable
he
was
always
provided
our
patient
soon
recovered
his
senses
and
evinced
no
little
gratitude
for
the
service
we
had
rendered
him
insisting
upon
our
accepting
at
his
hands
merely
he
said
as
a
souvenir
of
our
good
and
as
a
token
of
his
appreciation
of
the
same
a
small
and
an
odd
stone
pierced
in
the
centre
which
had
hung
from
the
end
of
his
held
in
place
by
a
minute
gold
ring
the
flask
became
the
property
of
parton
and
to
me
fell
the
stone
the
exact
hue
of
which
i
was
never
able
to
determine
since
it
was
chameleonic
in
its
properties
when
it
was
placed
in
my
hands
by
our
grateful
patient
it
was
blood
when
i
looked
upon
it
on
the
following
morning
it
was
of
a
livid
indescribable
hue
yet
lustrous
as
an
opal
it
is
colorless
and
dull
as
though
some
animating
quality
that
it
had
once
possessed
had
forever
passed
from
it
you
seem
to
have
met
with
an
accident
said
parton
when
the
injured
man
had
recovered
sufficiently
to
speak
yes
he
said
wincing
with
pain
i
have
i
set
out
for
saddleback
this
morning
i
wished
to
visit
the
scales
tarn
and
get
a
glimpse
of
those
noonday
stars
that
are
said
to
make
its
waters
lustrous
and
and
to
catch
the
immortal
fish
i
queried
no
he
replied
with
a
laugh
i
should
have
been
satisfied
to
see
the
stars
and
i
did
see
the
stars
but
not
the
ones
i
set
out
to
see
i
have
always
been
more
or
less
careless
of
my
safety
walking
with
my
head
in
the
clouds
and
letting
my
feet
look
out
for
themselves
the
result
was
that
i
slipped
on
a
stone
and
fell
over
a
very
picturesque
bit
of
scenery
on
to
some
more
stones
that
unfortunately
were
not
but
the
cut
in
your
arm
said
parton
suspiciously
that
looks
as
if
somebody
else
had
given
it
to
you
the
stranger
face
flushed
as
red
as
could
be
considering
the
amount
of
blood
he
had
lost
and
a
look
of
absolute
devilishness
that
made
my
flesh
creep
came
into
his
eyes
for
a
moment
he
did
not
speak
and
then
covering
the
delay
in
his
answer
with
a
groan
of
anguish
he
said
oh
that
yes
i
i
did
manage
to
cut
myself
rather
badly
and
i
do
see
how
you
could
though
insisted
parton
you
reach
that
part
of
yourself
with
a
knife
if
you
tried
that
just
the
reason
why
you
should
see
for
yourself
that
it
was
caused
by
my
falling
on
my
knife
i
had
it
grasped
in
my
right
hand
intending
to
cut
myself
a
stick
when
i
slipped
as
i
slipped
it
flew
from
my
hand
and
i
landed
on
it
fortunately
on
the
edge
and
not
on
the
point
he
explained
his
manner
far
from
convincing
though
the
explanation
seemed
so
simple
that
to
doubt
it
were
useless
did
you
recover
the
knife
asked
parton
it
must
have
been
a
mighty
sharp
one
and
rather
larger
than
most
people
carry
about
with
them
on
excursions
like
yours
i
am
not
on
the
sir
returned
the
other
somewhat
petulantly
and
so
i
fail
to
see
why
you
should
question
me
so
closely
in
regard
to
so
simple
a
matter
as
though
you
suspected
me
of
some
wrongdoing
my
friend
is
a
doctor
i
explained
for
while
i
was
quite
as
much
interested
in
the
incident
its
whys
and
wherefores
as
was
parton
i
had
myself
noticed
that
he
was
suspicious
of
his
chance
patient
and
seemingly
not
so
sympathetic
as
he
would
otherwise
have
been
he
regards
you
as
a
case
not
at
all
returned
parton
i
am
simply
interested
to
know
how
you
hurt
yourself
that
is
all
i
mean
no
offence
i
am
sure
and
if
anything
i
have
said
has
hurt
your
feelings
i
apologize
do
mention
it
doctor
replied
the
other
with
an
uneasy
smile
holding
his
left
hand
out
towards
parton
as
he
spoke
i
am
in
great
pain
as
you
know
and
perhaps
i
seem
irritable
i
not
an
amiable
man
at
best
as
for
the
knife
in
my
agony
i
never
thought
to
look
for
it
again
though
i
suppose
if
i
had
looked
i
should
not
have
found
it
since
it
doubtless
fell
into
the
underbrush
out
of
sight
let
it
rest
there
it
has
not
done
me
a
friendly
service
and
i
shall
waste
no
tears
over
it
with
which
effort
at
pleasantry
he
rose
with
some
difficulty
to
his
feet
and
with
the
assistance
of
parton
and
myself
walked
on
and
into
keswick
where
we
stopped
for
the
night
the
stranger
registered
directly
ahead
of
parton
and
myself
writing
the
words
carleton
barker
calcutta
in
the
book
and
immediately
retired
to
his
room
nor
did
we
see
him
again
that
night
after
supper
we
looked
for
him
but
as
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
we
concluded
that
he
had
gone
to
bed
to
seek
the
recuperation
of
rest
parton
and
i
lit
our
cigars
and
though
somewhat
fatigued
by
our
exertions
strolled
quietly
about
the
more
or
less
somnolent
burg
in
which
we
were
discussing
the
events
of
the
day
and
chiefly
our
new
acquaintance
i
do
half
like
that
fellow
said
parton
with
a
dubious
shake
of
the
head
if
a
dead
body
should
turn
up
near
or
on
skiddaw
morning
i
would
like
to
wager
that
carleton
barker
had
put
it
there
he
acted
to
me
like
a
man
who
had
something
to
conceal
and
if
i
could
have
done
it
without
seeming
ungracious
have
flung
his
old
flask
as
far
into
the
fields
as
i
could
half
a
mind
to
show
my
contempt
for
it
now
by
filling
it
with
some
of
that
beastly
claret
they
have
at
the
here
and
chucking
the
whole
thing
into
the
lake
it
was
an
insult
to
offer
those
things
to
us
i
think
you
are
unjust
parton
i
said
he
certainly
did
look
as
if
he
had
been
in
a
maul
with
somebody
there
was
a
nasty
scratch
on
his
face
and
that
cut
on
the
arm
was
suspicious
but
i
ca
see
but
that
his
explanation
was
clear
enough
your
manner
was
too
irritating
i
think
if
i
had
met
with
an
accident
and
was
assisted
by
an
utter
stranger
who
after
placing
me
under
obligations
to
him
acted
towards
me
as
though
i
were
an
unconvicted
criminal
i
be
as
mad
as
he
was
and
as
for
the
insult
of
his
offering
in
my
eyes
that
was
the
only
way
he
could
soothe
his
injured
feelings
he
was
angry
at
your
suspicions
and
to
be
entirely
your
debtor
for
services
did
please
him
his
gift
to
me
was
made
simply
because
he
did
not
wish
to
pay
you
in
substance
and
me
in
thanks
i
do
go
so
far
as
to
call
him
an
unconvicted
criminal
but
swear
his
record
is
clear
as
daylight
and
i
morally
convinced
that
if
men
deeds
were
written
on
their
foreheads
carleton
barker
esquire
would
wear
his
hat
down
over
his
eyes
i
do
like
him
i
instinctively
dislike
him
did
you
see
the
look
in
his
eyes
when
i
mentioned
the
knife
i
did
i
replied
and
it
made
me
shudder
it
turned
every
drop
of
blood
in
my
veins
cold
said
parton
it
made
me
feel
that
if
he
had
had
that
knife
within
reach
he
would
have
trampled
it
to
powder
even
if
every
stamp
of
his
foot
cut
his
flesh
through
to
the
bone
malignant
is
the
word
to
describe
that
glance
and
i
rather
encounter
a
than
see
it
again
parton
spoke
with
such
evident
earnestness
that
i
took
refuge
in
silence
i
could
see
just
where
a
man
of
parton
temperament
which
was
cold
and
eminently
judicial
even
when
his
affections
were
concerned
could
find
that
in
barker
at
which
to
cavil
but
for
all
that
i
could
not
sympathize
with
the
extreme
view
he
took
of
his
character
i
have
known
many
a
man
upon
whose
face
nature
has
set
the
stamp
of
the
villain
much
more
deeply
than
it
was
impressed
upon
barker
countenance
who
has
lived
a
life
most
irreproachable
whose
every
act
has
been
one
of
unselfishness
and
for
the
good
of
mankind
and
i
have
also
seen
outward
appearing
saints
whose
every
instinct
was
base
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
physiognomy
of
the
unfortunate
victim
of
the
rock
and
vindictive
knife
was
just
enough
of
a
medium
between
that
of
the
irredeemable
sinner
and
the
sterling
saint
to
indicate
that
its
owner
was
the
average
man
in
the
matter
of
vices
and
virtues
in
fact
the
malignancy
of
his
expression
when
the
knife
was
mentioned
was
to
me
the
sole
point
against
him
and
had
i
been
in
his
position
i
do
not
think
i
should
have
acted
very
differently
though
i
must
add
that
if
i
thought
myself
capable
of
freezing
any
person
blood
with
an
expression
of
my
eyes
i
should
be
strongly
tempted
to
wear
blue
glasses
when
in
company
or
before
a
mirror
i
think
i
send
my
card
up
to
him
jack
i
said
to
parton
when
we
had
returned
to
the
hotel
just
to
ask
how
he
is
would
you
no
snapped
parton
but
then
i
not
you
you
can
do
as
you
please
do
let
me
influence
you
against
him
if
he
to
your
taste
he
is
at
all
to
my
taste
i
retorted
i
do
care
for
him
particularly
but
it
seems
to
me
courtesy
requires
that
we
show
a
little
interest
in
his
welfare
be
courteous
then
and
show
your
interest
said
parton
i
care
as
long
as
i
am
not
dragged
into
it
i
sent
my
card
up
by
the
boy
who
returning
in
a
moment
said
that
the
door
was
locked
adding
that
when
he
had
knocked
upon
it
there
came
no
answer
from
which
he
presumed
that
barker
had
gone
to
sleep
he
seemed
all
right
when
you
took
his
supper
to
his
room
i
queried
he
said
he
would
have
any
supper
just
wanted
to
be
left
alone
said
the
boy
sulking
over
the
knife
still
i
imagine
sneered
parton
and
then
he
and
i
retired
to
our
room
and
prepared
for
bed
i
do
not
suppose
i
had
slept
for
more
than
an
hour
when
i
was
awakened
by
parton
who
was
pacing
the
floor
like
a
caged
tiger
his
eyes
all
ablaze
and
laboring
under
an
intense
nervous
excitement
what
the
matter
jack
i
asked
sitting
up
in
bed
that
d
ned
barker
has
upset
my
nerves
he
replied
i
ca
get
him
out
of
my
mind
oh
pshaw
i
replied
do
be
silly
forget
him
silly
he
retorted
angrily
silly
forget
him
hang
it
i
would
forget
him
if
he
let
me
but
he
wo
what
has
he
got
to
do
with
it
more
than
is
decent
ejaculated
parton
more
than
is
decent
he
has
just
been
peering
in
through
that
window
there
and
he
means
no
good
why
you
mad
i
remonstrated
he
could
peer
in
at
the
window
we
are
on
the
fourth
floor
and
there
is
no
possible
way
in
which
he
could
reach
the
window
much
less
peer
in
at
it
nevertheless
insisted
parton
carleton
barker
for
ten
minutes
previous
to
your
waking
was
peering
in
at
me
through
that
window
there
and
in
his
glance
was
that
same
malignant
hateful
quality
that
so
set
me
against
him
and
another
thing
bob
added
parton
stopping
his
nervous
walk
for
a
moment
and
shaking
his
finger
impressively
at
me
another
thing
which
i
did
not
tell
you
before
because
i
thought
it
would
fill
you
with
that
same
awful
dread
that
has
come
to
me
since
meeting
barker
the
blood
from
that
man
arm
the
blood
that
stained
his
crimson
that
besmeared
his
clothes
spurted
out
upon
my
cuff
and
when
i
strove
to
stanch
its
flow
yes
i
remember
that
said
i
and
now
look
at
my
cuff
and
sleeve
whispered
parton
his
face
grown
white
i
looked
there
was
no
stain
of
any
sort
whatsoever
upon
either
certainly
there
must
have
been
something
wrong
about
carleton
barker
ii
the
mystery
of
carleton
barker
was
by
no
means
lessened
when
next
morning
it
was
found
that
his
room
not
only
was
empty
but
that
as
far
as
one
could
judge
from
the
aspect
of
things
therein
it
had
not
been
occupied
at
all
furthermore
our
chance
acquaintance
had
vanished
leaving
no
more
trace
of
his
whereabouts
than
if
he
had
never
existed
good
riddance
said
parton
i
am
afraid
he
and
i
would
have
come
to
blows
sooner
or
later
because
the
mere
thought
of
him
was
beginning
to
inspire
me
with
a
desire
to
thrash
him
i
sure
he
deserves
a
trouncing
whoever
he
is
i
too
was
glad
the
fellow
had
passed
out
of
our
ken
but
not
for
the
reason
advanced
by
parton
since
the
discovery
of
the
stainless
cuff
where
marks
of
blood
ought
by
nature
to
have
been
i
goose
at
the
mention
of
his
name
there
was
something
so
inexpressibly
uncanny
about
a
creature
having
a
fluid
of
that
sort
in
his
veins
in
fact
so
unpleasantly
was
i
impressed
by
that
episode
that
i
was
unwilling
even
to
join
in
a
search
for
the
mysteriously
missing
barker
and
by
common
consent
parton
and
i
dropped
him
entirely
as
a
subject
for
conversation
we
spent
the
balance
of
our
week
at
keswick
using
it
as
our
head
for
little
trips
about
the
surrounding
country
which
is
most
charmingly
adapted
to
the
wants
of
those
inclined
to
pedestrianism
and
on
sunday
evening
began
preparations
for
our
departure
discarding
our
knickerbockers
and
resuming
the
habiliments
of
urban
life
intending
on
monday
morning
to
run
up
to
edinburgh
there
to
while
away
a
few
days
before
starting
for
a
short
trip
through
the
trossachs
while
engaged
in
packing
our
portmanteaux
there
came
a
sharp
knock
at
the
door
and
upon
opening
it
i
found
upon
the
hall
floor
an
envelope
addressed
to
myself
there
was
no
one
anywhere
in
the
hall
and
so
quickly
had
i
opened
the
door
after
the
knock
that
fact
mystified
me
it
would
hardly
have
been
possible
for
any
person
however
nimble
of
foot
to
have
passed
out
of
sight
in
the
period
which
had
elapsed
between
the
summons
and
my
response
what
is
it
asked
parton
observing
that
i
was
slightly
agitated
nothing
i
said
desirous
of
concealing
from
him
the
matter
that
bothered
me
lest
i
should
be
laughed
at
for
my
pains
nothing
except
a
letter
for
me
not
by
post
is
it
he
queried
to
which
he
added
ca
be
there
is
no
mail
here
some
friend
i
do
know
i
said
trying
in
a
somewhat
feminine
fashion
to
solve
the
authorship
of
the
letter
before
opening
it
by
staring
at
the
superscription
i
do
recognize
the
handwriting
at
all
i
then
opened
the
letter
and
glancing
hastily
at
the
signature
was
filled
with
uneasiness
to
see
who
my
correspondent
was
it
from
that
fellow
barker
i
said
barker
cried
parton
what
on
earth
has
barker
been
writing
to
you
about
he
is
in
trouble
i
replied
as
i
read
the
letter
financial
i
presume
and
wants
a
lift
suggested
parton
worse
than
that
said
i
he
is
in
prison
in
london
ejaculated
parton
in
prison
in
london
what
for
on
suspicion
of
having
murdered
an
innkeeper
in
the
south
of
england
on
tuesday
august
well
i
sorry
to
say
that
i
believe
he
was
guilty
returned
parton
without
reflecting
that
the
day
of
august
was
the
day
upon
which
he
and
i
had
first
encountered
barker
that
your
prejudice
jack
said
i
if
you
think
a
minute
you
know
he
was
innocent
he
was
here
on
august
last
tuesday
it
was
then
that
you
and
i
saw
him
for
the
first
time
limping
along
the
road
and
bleeding
from
a
wound
in
the
shoulder
was
tuesday
the
said
parton
counting
the
days
backward
on
his
fingers
that
a
fact
it
was
but
it
none
of
my
affair
anyhow
it
is
too
blessed
queer
for
me
to
mix
myself
up
in
it
and
i
say
let
him
languish
in
jail
he
deserved
it
for
something
i
am
well
i
not
so
confoundedly
heartless
i
returned
pounding
the
table
with
my
fist
indignant
that
parton
should
allow
his
prejudices
to
run
away
with
his
sense
of
justice
i
going
to
london
to
do
as
he
asks
what
does
he
want
you
to
do
prove
an
alibi
precisely
and
i
going
and
you
going
and
i
shall
see
if
the
landlord
here
wo
let
me
take
one
of
his
boys
along
to
support
our
testimony
at
my
own
expense
if
need
be
you
right
old
chap
returned
parton
after
a
moment
of
internal
struggle
i
suppose
we
really
ought
to
help
the
fellow
out
of
his
scrape
but
i
decidedly
averse
to
getting
mixed
up
in
an
affair
of
any
kind
with
a
man
like
carleton
barker
much
less
in
an
affair
with
murder
in
it
is
he
specific
about
the
murder
no
he
refers
me
to
the
london
papers
of
the
and
for
details
he
had
time
to
write
more
because
he
comes
up
for
examination
on
tuesday
morning
and
as
our
presence
is
essential
to
his
case
he
was
necessarily
hurried
it
deucedly
hard
luck
for
us
said
parton
ruefully
it
means
no
scotland
this
trip
how
about
barker
luck
i
asked
he
is
fighting
for
a
scottish
trip
he
fighting
for
his
life
and
so
it
happened
that
on
monday
morning
instead
of
starting
for
edinburgh
we
boarded
the
train
for
london
at
we
tried
to
get
copies
of
the
newspapers
containing
accounts
of
the
crime
that
had
been
committed
but
our
efforts
were
unavailing
and
it
was
not
until
we
arrived
in
london
and
were
visited
by
barker
attorneys
that
we
obtained
any
detailed
information
whatsoever
of
the
murder
and
when
we
did
get
it
we
were
more
than
ever
regretful
to
be
mixed
up
in
it
for
it
was
an
unusually
brutal
murder
strange
to
say
the
evidence
against
barker
was
extraordinarily
convincing
considering
that
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime
he
was
hundreds
of
miles
from
the
scene
there
was
testimony
from
railway
guards
neighbors
of
the
murdered
innkeeper
and
others
that
it
was
barker
and
no
one
else
who
committed
the
crime
his
identification
was
complete
and
the
wound
in
his
shoulder
was
shown
almost
beyond
the
possibility
of
doubt
to
have
been
inflicted
by
the
murdered
man
in
our
only
hope
said
the
attorney
gravely
is
in
proving
an
alibi
i
do
not
know
what
to
believe
myself
the
chain
of
evidence
against
my
client
is
so
complete
and
yet
he
asserts
his
innocence
and
has
stated
to
me
that
you
two
gentlemen
could
assist
in
proving
it
if
you
actually
encountered
carleton
barker
in
the
neighborhood
of
keswick
on
the
of
this
month
the
whole
case
against
him
falls
to
the
ground
if
not
i
fear
his
outlook
has
the
gallows
at
the
small
end
of
the
perspective
we
certainly
did
meet
a
carleton
barker
at
keswick
on
tuesday
august
returned
parton
and
he
was
wounded
in
the
shoulder
and
his
appearance
was
what
might
have
been
expected
of
one
who
had
been
through
just
such
a
frightful
murder
as
we
understand
this
to
have
been
but
this
was
explained
to
us
as
due
to
a
fall
over
rocks
in
the
vicinity
of
the
scales
tarn
which
was
plausible
enough
to
satisfy
my
friend
here
and
not
yourself
queried
the
attorney
well
i
do
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
it
returned
parton
as
to
the
locality
there
is
no
question
he
was
there
we
saw
him
and
others
saw
him
and
we
have
taken
the
trouble
to
come
down
here
to
state
the
fact
and
have
brought
with
us
the
from
the
hotel
who
can
support
our
testimony
if
it
is
not
regarded
as
sufficient
i
advise
you
however
as
attorney
for
barker
not
to
inquire
too
deeply
into
that
matter
because
i
am
convinced
that
if
he
is
guilty
of
this
crime
as
of
course
he
is
not
he
has
the
cleanest
record
in
the
world
he
has
bad
written
on
every
line
of
his
face
and
there
were
one
or
two
things
connected
with
our
meeting
with
him
that
might
be
to
his
taste
to
have
mentioned
in
court
i
do
need
advice
thank
you
said
the
attorney
dryly
i
wish
simply
to
establish
the
fact
of
his
presence
at
keswick
at
the
hour
of
on
tuesday
august
that
was
the
hour
at
which
the
murder
is
supposed
in
fact
is
proved
to
have
been
committed
at
according
to
witnesses
my
client
was
seen
in
the
neighborhood
faint
with
loss
of
blood
from
a
in
the
shoulder
barker
has
the
but
he
might
have
a
dozen
of
them
and
be
acquitted
if
he
was
in
frewenton
on
the
day
in
question
you
may
rely
upon
us
to
prove
that
said
i
we
will
swear
to
it
we
can
produce
tangible
objects
presented
to
us
on
that
afternoon
by
barker
i
ca
produce
mine
said
parton
i
threw
it
into
the
lake
well
i
can
produce
the
stone
he
gave
me
said
i
and
i
do
it
if
you
wish
that
will
be
sufficient
i
think
returned
the
attorney
barker
spoke
especially
about
that
stone
for
it
was
a
half
of
an
odd
souvenir
of
the
east
where
he
was
born
and
he
fortunately
has
the
other
half
the
two
will
fit
together
at
the
point
where
the
break
was
made
and
our
case
will
be
complete
the
attorney
then
left
us
the
following
day
we
appeared
at
the
preliminary
examination
which
proved
to
be
the
whole
examination
as
well
since
despite
the
damning
circumstantial
evidence
against
barker
evidence
which
shook
my
belief
almost
in
the
veracity
of
my
own
eyes
our
plain
statements
substantiated
by
the
evidence
of
the
and
the
two
halves
of
the
oriental
pebble
one
in
my
possession
and
the
other
in
barker
brought
about
the
discharge
of
the
prisoner
from
custody
and
the
frewenton
atrocity
became
one
of
many
horrible
murders
the
mystery
of
which
time
alone
if
anything
could
unravel
after
barker
was
released
he
came
to
me
and
thanked
me
most
effusively
for
the
service
rendered
him
and
in
many
ways
made
himself
agreeable
during
the
balance
of
our
stay
in
london
parton
however
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
and
to
me
most
of
his
attentions
were
paid
he
always
had
a
singularly
uneasy
way
about
him
as
though
he
were
afraid
of
some
impending
trouble
and
finally
after
a
day
spent
with
him
slumming
about
london
and
a
more
perfect
slummer
no
one
ever
saw
for
he
was
apparently
familiar
with
every
one
of
the
worst
and
lowest
resorts
in
all
of
london
as
well
as
on
intimate
terms
with
leaders
in
the
criminal
world
i
put
a
few
questions
to
him
impertinently
pertinent
to
himself
he
was
surprisingly
frank
in
his
answers
i
was
quite
prepared
for
a
more
or
less
indignant
refusal
when
i
asked
him
to
account
for
his
intimacy
with
these
dregs
of
civilization
it
a
long
story
he
said
but
i
tell
it
to
you
let
us
run
in
here
and
have
a
chop
and
i
give
you
some
account
of
myself
over
a
mug
of
ale
we
entered
one
of
the
numerous
small
that
make
london
a
delight
to
the
lover
of
the
chop
in
the
fulness
of
its
glory
when
we
were
seated
and
the
luncheon
ordered
barker
began
i
have
led
a
very
unhappy
life
i
was
born
in
india
years
ago
and
while
my
every
act
has
been
as
open
and
as
free
of
wrong
as
are
those
of
an
infant
i
have
constantly
been
beset
by
such
untoward
affairs
as
this
in
which
you
have
rendered
such
inestimable
service
at
the
age
of
five
in
calcutta
i
was
in
peril
of
my
liberty
on
the
score
of
depravity
although
i
never
committed
any
act
that
could
in
any
sense
be
called
depraved
the
main
cause
of
my
trouble
at
that
time
was
a
small
girl
of
ten
whose
sight
was
partially
destroyed
by
the
fiendish
act
of
some
one
who
according
to
her
statement
wantonly
hurled
a
piece
of
broken
glass
into
one
of
her
eyes
the
girl
said
it
was
i
who
did
it
although
at
the
time
it
was
done
according
to
my
mother
testimony
i
was
playing
in
her
room
and
in
her
plain
view
that
alone
would
not
have
been
a
very
serious
matter
for
me
because
the
injured
child
might
have
been
herself
responsible
for
her
injury
but
in
a
childish
spirit
of
fear
afraid
to
say
so
and
not
realizing
the
enormity
of
the
charge
have
laid
it
at
the
door
of
any
one
of
her
playmates
she
saw
fit
she
stuck
to
her
story
however
and
there
were
many
who
believed
that
she
spoke
the
truth
and
that
my
mother
in
an
endeavor
to
keep
me
out
of
trouble
had
stated
what
was
not
true
but
you
were
innocent
of
course
i
said
i
am
sorry
you
think
it
necessary
to
ask
that
he
replied
his
pallid
face
flushing
with
a
not
unnatural
indignation
and
i
decline
to
answer
it
he
added
i
have
made
a
practice
of
late
when
i
am
in
trouble
or
in
any
way
under
suspicion
to
let
others
do
my
pleading
and
prove
my
innocence
but
you
did
mean
to
be
like
your
friend
parton
i
know
and
i
can
not
be
angry
with
a
man
who
has
done
so
much
for
me
as
you
have
so
let
it
pass
i
was
saying
that
standing
alone
the
accusation
of
that
young
girl
would
not
have
been
serious
in
its
effects
in
view
of
my
mother
testimony
had
not
a
seeming
corroboration
come
three
days
later
when
another
child
was
reported
to
have
been
pushed
over
an
embankment
and
maimed
for
life
by
no
less
a
person
than
my
poor
innocent
self
this
time
i
was
again
on
my
mother
testimony
at
her
side
but
there
were
witnesses
of
the
crime
and
they
every
one
of
them
swore
to
my
guilt
and
as
a
consequence
we
found
it
advisable
to
leave
the
home
that
had
been
ours
since
my
birth
and
to
come
to
england
my
father
had
contemplated
returning
to
his
own
country
for
some
time
and
the
reputation
that
i
had
managed
unwittingly
to
build
up
for
myself
in
calcutta
was
of
a
sort
that
made
it
easier
for
him
to
make
up
his
mind
he
at
first
swore
that
he
would
ferret
out
the
mystery
in
the
matter
and
would
go
through
calcutta
with
a
if
necessary
to
find
the
possible
other
boy
who
so
resembled
me
that
his
outrageous
acts
were
put
upon
my
shoulders
but
people
had
to
make
up
their
minds
that
there
was
not
only
something
wrong
about
me
but
that
my
mother
knew
it
and
had
tried
to
get
me
out
of
my
scrapes
by
lying
so
there
was
nothing
for
us
to
do
but
leave
and
you
never
solved
the
mystery
i
queried
well
not
exactly
returned
barker
gazing
abstractedly
before
him
not
exactly
but
i
have
a
theory
based
upon
the
bitterest
kind
of
experience
that
i
know
what
the
trouble
is
you
have
a
double
i
asked
you
are
a
good
guesser
he
replied
and
of
all
unhanged
criminals
he
is
the
very
worst
there
was
a
strange
smile
on
his
lips
as
carleton
barker
said
this
his
tone
was
almost
that
of
one
who
was
boasting
in
fact
so
strongly
was
i
impressed
with
his
appearance
of
conceit
when
he
estimated
the
character
of
his
double
that
i
felt
bold
enough
to
say
you
seem
to
be
a
little
proud
of
it
in
spite
of
all
barker
laughed
i
ca
help
it
though
he
has
kept
me
on
for
a
lifetime
he
said
we
all
feel
a
certain
amount
of
pride
in
the
success
of
those
to
whom
we
are
related
either
by
family
ties
or
other
shackles
like
those
with
which
i
am
bound
to
my
murderous
i
knew
an
englishman
once
who
was
so
impressed
with
the
notion
that
he
resembled
the
great
napoleon
that
he
conceived
the
most
ardent
hatred
for
his
own
country
for
having
sent
the
illustrious
frenchman
to
helena
the
same
influence
a
very
subtle
one
i
feel
here
is
a
man
who
has
maimed
and
robbed
and
murdered
for
years
and
has
never
yet
been
apprehended
in
his
chosen
calling
he
has
been
successful
and
though
i
have
been
put
to
my
trumps
many
a
time
to
save
my
neck
from
the
retribution
that
should
have
been
his
i
ca
help
admiring
the
fellow
though
kill
him
if
he
stood
before
me
and
are
you
making
any
effort
to
find
him
i
am
of
course
said
barker
that
has
been
my
i
am
fortunately
possessed
of
means
enough
to
live
on
so
that
i
can
devote
all
my
time
to
unravelling
the
mystery
it
is
for
this
reason
that
i
have
acquainted
myself
with
the
element
of
london
with
which
as
you
have
noticed
i
am
very
familiar
the
life
these
criminals
are
leading
is
quite
as
revolting
to
me
as
it
is
to
you
and
the
scenes
you
and
i
have
witnessed
together
are
no
more
unpleasant
to
you
than
they
are
to
me
but
what
can
i
do
the
man
lives
and
must
be
run
down
he
is
in
england
i
am
certain
this
latest
diversion
of
his
has
convinced
me
of
that
well
said
i
rising
you
certainly
have
my
sympathy
barker
and
i
hope
your
efforts
will
meet
with
success
i
trust
you
will
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
other
gentleman
hanged
thank
you
he
said
with
a
queer
look
in
his
eyes
which
as
i
thought
it
over
afterwards
did
not
seem
to
be
quite
as
appropriate
to
his
expression
of
gratitude
as
it
might
have
been
iii
when
barker
and
i
parted
that
day
it
was
for
a
longer
period
than
either
of
us
dreamed
for
upon
my
arrival
at
my
lodgings
i
found
there
a
cable
message
from
new
york
calling
me
back
to
my
labors
three
days
later
i
sailed
for
home
and
five
years
elapsed
before
i
was
so
fortunate
as
to
renew
my
acquaintance
with
foreign
climes
occasionally
through
these
years
parton
and
i
discussed
barker
and
at
no
time
did
my
companion
show
anything
but
an
increased
animosity
towards
our
strange
keswick
acquaintance
the
mention
of
his
name
was
sufficient
to
drive
parton
from
the
height
of
exuberance
to
a
state
of
abject
depression
i
shall
not
feel
easy
while
that
man
lives
he
said
i
think
he
is
a
minion
of
satan
there
is
nothing
earthly
about
him
nonsense
said
i
just
because
a
man
has
a
bad
face
is
no
reason
for
supposing
him
a
villain
or
a
supernatural
creature
no
parton
answered
but
when
a
man
veins
hold
blood
that
saturates
and
leaves
no
stain
what
are
we
to
think
i
confessed
that
this
was
a
point
beyond
me
and
by
mutual
consent
we
dropped
the
subject
one
night
parton
came
to
my
rooms
white
as
a
sheet
and
so
agitated
that
for
a
few
minutes
he
could
not
speak
he
dropped
shaking
like
a
leaf
into
my
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
his
attitude
was
that
of
one
frightened
to
the
very
core
of
his
being
when
i
questioned
him
first
he
did
not
respond
he
simply
groaned
i
resumed
my
reading
for
a
few
moments
and
then
looking
up
observed
that
parton
had
recovered
somewhat
and
was
now
gazing
abstractedly
into
the
fire
well
i
said
feeling
better
yes
he
answered
slowly
but
it
was
a
shock
what
was
i
asked
you
told
me
nothing
as
yet
i
seen
barker
no
i
cried
where
in
a
back
alley
where
i
had
to
go
on
a
hospital
call
there
was
a
row
in
a
in
hester
street
two
men
were
cut
and
i
had
to
go
with
the
ambulance
both
men
will
probably
die
and
no
one
can
find
any
trace
of
the
murderer
but
i
know
who
he
is
he
was
carleton
barker
and
no
one
else
i
passed
him
in
the
alley
on
the
way
in
and
i
saw
him
in
the
crowd
when
i
came
out
was
he
alone
in
the
alley
i
asked
parton
groaned
again
that
the
worst
of
it
said
he
he
was
not
alone
he
was
with
carleton
barker
you
speak
in
riddles
said
i
i
saw
in
riddles
said
parton
for
as
truly
as
i
sit
here
there
were
two
of
them
and
they
stood
side
by
side
as
i
passed
through
alike
as
two
peas
and
crime
written
on
the
pallid
face
of
each
did
barker
recognize
you
i
think
so
for
as
i
passed
he
gasped
both
of
them
gasped
and
as
i
stopped
to
speak
to
the
one
i
had
first
recognized
he
had
vanished
as
completely
as
though
he
had
never
been
and
as
i
turned
to
address
the
other
he
was
shambling
off
into
the
darkness
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
i
was
stunned
barker
had
been
mysterious
enough
in
london
in
new
york
with
his
double
and
again
connected
with
an
atrocity
he
became
even
more
so
and
i
began
to
feel
somewhat
towards
him
as
had
parton
from
the
first
the
papers
next
morning
were
not
very
explicit
on
the
subject
of
the
hester
street
trouble
but
they
confirmed
parton
suspicions
in
his
and
my
own
mind
as
to
whom
the
assassins
were
the
accounts
published
simply
stated
that
the
wounded
men
one
of
whom
had
died
in
the
night
and
the
other
of
whom
would
doubtless
not
live
through
the
day
had
been
set
upon
and
stabbed
by
two
unknown
englishmen
who
had
charged
them
with
cheating
at
cards
that
the
assailants
had
disappeared
and
that
the
police
had
no
clew
as
to
their
whereabouts
time
passed
and
nothing
further
came
to
light
concerning
the
barkers
and
gradually
parton
and
i
came
to
forget
them
the
following
summer
i
went
abroad
again
and
then
came
the
climax
to
the
barker
episode
as
we
called
it
i
can
best
tell
the
story
of
that
climax
by
printing
here
a
letter
written
by
myself
to
parton
it
was
penned
within
an
hour
of
the
supreme
moment
and
while
it
evidences
my
own
mental
perturbation
in
its
lack
of
coherence
it
is
none
the
less
an
absolutely
truthful
account
of
what
happened
the
letter
is
as
follows
london
july
my
dear
parton
you
once
said
to
me
that
you
could
not
breathe
easily
while
this
world
held
carleton
barker
living
you
may
now
draw
an
easy
breath
and
many
of
them
for
the
barker
episode
is
over
barker
is
dead
and
i
flatter
myself
that
i
am
doing
very
well
myself
to
live
sanely
after
the
experiences
of
this
morning
about
a
week
after
my
arrival
in
england
a
horrible
tragedy
was
enacted
in
the
seven
dials
district
a
woman
was
the
victim
and
a
devil
in
human
form
the
perpetrator
of
the
crime
the
poor
creature
was
literally
hacked
to
pieces
in
a
manner
suggesting
the
hand
of
jack
the
ripper
but
in
this
instance
the
murderer
unlike
jack
was
caught
and
turned
out
to
be
no
less
a
person
than
carleton
barker
he
was
tried
and
convicted
and
sentenced
to
be
hanged
at
twelve
when
i
heard
of
barker
trouble
i
went
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
solely
to
the
trial
and
discovered
in
the
dock
the
man
you
and
i
had
encountered
at
keswick
that
is
to
say
he
resembled
our
friend
in
every
possible
respect
if
he
were
not
barker
he
was
the
most
perfect
imitation
of
barker
conceivable
not
a
feature
of
our
barker
but
was
reproduced
in
this
one
even
to
the
name
but
he
failed
to
recognize
me
he
saw
me
i
know
because
i
felt
his
eyes
upon
me
but
in
trying
to
return
his
gaze
i
quailed
utterly
before
him
i
could
not
look
him
in
the
eye
without
a
feeling
of
the
most
deadly
horror
but
i
did
see
enough
of
him
to
note
that
he
regarded
me
only
as
one
of
a
thousand
spectators
who
had
flocked
into
the
during
the
progress
of
the
trial
if
it
were
our
barker
who
sat
there
his
dissemblance
was
remarkable
so
coldly
did
he
look
at
me
that
i
began
to
doubt
if
he
really
were
the
man
we
had
met
but
the
events
of
this
morning
have
changed
my
mind
utterly
on
that
point
he
was
the
one
we
had
met
and
i
am
now
convinced
that
his
story
to
me
of
his
double
was
purely
fictitious
and
that
from
beginning
to
end
there
has
been
but
one
barker
the
trial
was
a
speedy
one
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
in
behalf
of
the
prisoner
and
within
five
days
of
his
arraignment
he
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
the
extreme
penalty
that
of
hanging
and
noon
was
the
hour
appointed
for
the
execution
i
was
to
have
gone
to
richmond
by
coach
but
since
barker
trial
i
have
been
in
a
measure
depressed
i
have
grown
to
dislike
the
man
as
thoroughly
as
did
you
and
yet
i
was
very
much
affected
by
the
thought
that
he
was
finally
to
meet
death
upon
the
scaffold
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
participate
in
any
pleasures
on
the
day
of
his
execution
and
in
consequence
i
gave
up
my
richmond
journey
and
remained
all
morning
in
my
lodgings
trying
to
read
it
was
a
miserable
effort
i
could
not
concentrate
my
mind
upon
my
book
no
book
could
have
held
the
slightest
part
of
my
attention
at
that
time
my
thoughts
were
all
for
carleton
barker
and
i
doubt
if
when
the
clock
hands
pointed
to
half
after
eleven
barker
himself
was
more
apprehensive
over
what
was
to
come
than
i
found
myself
holding
my
watch
in
my
hand
gazing
at
the
dial
and
counting
the
seconds
which
must
intervene
before
the
last
dreadful
scene
of
a
life
of
crime
i
would
rise
from
my
chair
and
pace
my
room
nervously
for
a
few
minutes
then
i
would
throw
myself
into
my
chair
again
and
stare
at
my
watch
this
went
on
nearly
all
the
morning
in
fact
until
ten
minutes
before
twelve
when
there
came
a
slight
knock
at
my
door
i
put
aside
my
nervousness
as
well
as
i
could
and
walking
to
the
door
opened
it
i
wonder
that
i
have
nerve
to
write
of
it
parton
but
there
upon
the
threshold
clad
in
the
deepest
black
his
face
pallid
as
the
head
of
death
itself
and
his
hands
shaking
like
those
of
a
palsied
man
stood
no
less
a
person
than
carleton
barker
i
staggered
back
in
amazement
and
he
followed
me
closing
the
door
and
locking
it
behind
him
would
you
do
i
cried
regarding
his
act
with
alarm
for
candidly
i
was
almost
abject
with
fear
to
you
he
said
have
been
as
far
as
you
could
be
my
friend
the
other
your
companion
of
keswick
meaning
you
of
course
my
enemy
i
was
glad
you
were
not
with
us
my
dear
parton
i
should
have
trembled
for
your
safety
have
you
managed
to
escape
i
asked
have
not
escaped
returned
barker
i
soon
shall
be
free
from
my
accursed
double
here
he
gave
an
unearthly
laugh
and
pointed
to
the
clock
ha
he
cried
minutes
more
five
minutes
more
and
i
shall
be
free
the
man
in
the
dock
was
not
you
i
asked
man
in
the
dock
he
answered
slowly
even
now
mounting
the
gallows
whilst
i
stand
here
he
trembled
a
little
as
he
spoke
and
lurched
forward
like
a
drunken
man
but
he
soon
recovered
himself
grasping
the
back
of
my
chair
convulsively
with
his
long
white
fingers
two
minutes
more
he
whispered
rope
will
be
adjusted
about
his
neck
the
black
cap
is
even
now
being
drawn
over
his
cursed
features
and
here
he
shrieked
with
laughter
and
rushing
to
the
window
thrust
his
head
out
and
literally
sucked
the
air
into
his
lungs
as
a
man
with
a
parched
throat
would
have
drank
water
then
he
turned
and
tottering
back
to
my
side
hoarsely
demanded
some
brandy
it
was
fortunately
at
hand
and
precisely
as
the
big
bells
in
westminster
began
to
sound
the
hour
of
noon
he
caught
up
the
goblet
and
held
it
aloft
him
he
cried
and
then
parton
standing
before
me
in
my
lodgings
as
truly
as
i
write
he
remained
fixed
and
rigid
until
the
twelfth
stroke
of
the
bells
sounded
when
he
literally
faded
from
my
sight
and
the
goblet
falling
to
the
floor
was
shattered
into
countless
atoms
the
end
