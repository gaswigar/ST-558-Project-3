claud
lovat
fraser
that
when
i
die
this
word
may
stand
for
me
he
had
a
heart
to
praise
an
eye
to
see
and
beauty
was
his
king
dead
at
the
age
of
after
a
sudden
operation
claud
lovat
fraser
was
as
surely
a
victim
of
the
war
as
though
he
had
fallen
in
action
he
was
full
of
vigour
for
his
work
but
had
left
him
with
a
heart
that
could
not
stand
a
strain
of
this
kind
and
all
his
own
fine
courage
could
not
help
the
surgeons
in
a
losing
fight
we
are
not
sorry
for
him
we
learn
that
not
to
be
sorry
for
the
dead
but
for
ourselves
this
terror
is
always
so
fresh
so
unexampled
i
had
telephoned
to
him
to
ask
whether
he
would
help
me
in
a
certain
theatrical
enterprise
i
was
told
by
his
servant
that
he
was
ill
but
one
hears
these
things
so
often
that
one
gave
but
little
thought
to
it
beyond
sending
a
telegram
asking
for
news
and
now
this
personal
griefs
are
of
no
public
interest
but
here
is
as
sad
a
public
loss
as
has
befallen
us
if
the
world
can
measure
truly
in
our
generation
but
it
is
not
i
think
of
our
loss
that
we
should
speak
now
these
desolations
strangely
have
a
way
of
bringing
their
own
fortitude
a
few
hours
after
hearing
without
any
warning
of
lovat
fraser
death
i
was
walking
among
the
english
landscape
that
he
loved
so
well
and
i
felt
there
how
poor
and
inadequate
a
thing
death
really
was
how
little
to
be
feared
this
apparent
intention
to
destroy
a
life
and
genius
so
young
so
admirable
and
so
rich
in
promise
seemed
for
all
the
hurt
in
some
way
wholly
to
have
failed
we
all
knew
that
given
health
the
next
ten
years
would
show
a
splendid
volume
of
work
from
the
new
power
and
understanding
to
which
he
had
been
coming
in
these
later
days
but
just
as
it
seems
to
me
not
the
occasion
to
lament
our
own
loss
so
does
it
seem
idle
to
speculate
with
regret
upon
what
art
may
have
lost
by
this
sudden
stroke
it
is
rather
well
to
be
glad
that
so
few
years
have
borne
so
abundantly
not
only
is
the
work
that
lovat
fraser
has
left
full
in
volume
it
is
decisive
in
character
beyond
all
likelihood
in
one
of
his
years
greatly
as
he
would
have
added
to
our
delight
and
wider
as
his
influence
would
have
grown
nothing
he
might
have
done
could
have
added
to
our
knowledge
of
the
kind
of
distinction
that
was
his
and
that
will
always
mark
his
fame
the
man
himself
had
a
charm
of
unusual
definition
one
might
go
to
his
studio
at
five
and
find
him
lumbering
with
his
great
frame
among
a
chaos
of
the
rare
and
curious
books
that
he
loved
stacked
on
to
the
shelves
littered
on
tables
and
the
floor
his
clothes
and
face
and
fingers
streaked
with
paint
and
then
an
hour
or
two
later
he
would
come
dressed
ready
for
the
theatre
an
immaculate
beau
of
the
his
top
coat
with
waist
and
skirts
his
opera
hat
made
to
special
order
by
a
bond
street
expert
on
an
last
and
then
before
setting
off
he
would
talk
of
some
who
was
a
little
down
and
out
and
wonder
whether
some
of
his
drawings
might
not
be
bought
at
a
few
guineas
apiece
then
to
book
as
it
were
such
an
order
gave
salt
to
his
evening
and
if
the
evening
meant
contact
with
some
of
his
own
exquisite
work
a
word
of
admiration
was
taken
with
that
wistful
gratitude
that
it
is
now
almost
unbearable
to
remember
the
theatre
is
a
complex
affair
and
it
is
idle
to
inquire
who
gives
more
than
another
to
it
but
on
one
side
of
its
effort
nobody
in
these
later
years
has
fought
for
light
and
beauty
more
surely
and
courageously
than
claud
lovat
fraser
like
every
fine
artist
he
was
sometimes
a
little
puzzled
a
little
hurt
that
the
critics
could
not
see
the
clear
motives
inspiring
his
work
but
the
purpose
never
faltered
you
like
beggar
the
exquisite
designs
for
madame
karsavina
later
ballets
these
made
it
plain
enough
that
a
new
genius
of
extraordinary
power
and
fertility
was
at
work
on
the
stage
with
a
knowledge
of
tradition
that
combined
the
widest
learning
with
profound
intuition
lovat
fraser
in
his
design
touched
the
life
of
five
hundred
years
with
the
english
spirit
of
our
own
time
with
a
certainty
that
every
one
of
his
colleagues
i
know
will
be
proud
to
allow
was
beyond
them
all
the
fertility
of
which
i
speak
was
perhaps
his
peculiar
distinction
and
it
had
no
touch
of
common
facility
he
could
not
draw
a
line
that
was
not
hard
with
thought
and
rooted
in
imaginative
decision
but
he
could
invent
with
immense
rapidity
it
was
the
old
though
rare
story
alike
in
his
theatre
design
and
his
tender
landscape
beauty
of
spirit
flowed
in
everything
he
did
into
beauty
of
execution
he
was
a
man
in
whose
presence
everything
mean
or
slipshod
withered
but
perhaps
it
is
most
fitting
at
this
time
that
we
should
think
of
our
dead
friend
in
yet
another
way
we
are
governed
by
two
influences
our
own
character
and
example
for
each
man
his
own
character
is
for
his
meditation
apart
but
of
example
we
may
sometimes
speak
together
in
the
open
with
profit
those
of
us
who
live
always
striving
towards
creative
effort
believe
passionately
that
the
thing
towards
which
we
aim
makes
for
all
that
is
most
chivalrous
and
most
intelligent
in
life
that
it
is
indeed
the
one
true
honesty
in
the
world
and
yet
we
know
how
easily
that
effort
is
beset
by
fears
and
jealousies
and
failure
in
generosity
how
lightly
we
who
should
together
give
all
our
energy
to
the
service
of
our
art
waste
it
in
little
concerns
of
spite
and
and
it
is
in
just
such
ways
as
this
that
great
example
may
serve
us
nobly
and
there
has
surely
never
lived
an
artist
in
whom
such
example
more
clearly
shone
art
which
for
him
embraced
and
crystallised
all
that
was
brave
and
adventurous
and
tender
was
the
worship
of
lovat
fraser
life
a
worship
which
he
kept
with
an
absolute
loyalty
it
is
my
privilege
to
know
most
of
the
best
artists
in
all
kinds
of
my
age
one
has
this
distinction
another
that
but
i
think
that
he
had
the
loveliest
of
them
all
i
have
known
nobody
who
brought
to
his
art
a
devotion
so
pure
and
utterly
removed
from
if
he
could
serve
the
beauty
that
he
loved
he
was
eager
always
to
do
so
with
perfect
indifference
to
his
own
reward
nobody
could
be
with
him
for
ten
minutes
without
feeling
that
art
was
a
thing
far
greater
than
any
artist
he
had
the
lovely
humorous
humility
that
is
the
one
sure
sign
of
greatness
one
felt
always
that
if
he
should
think
that
another
might
do
given
work
better
than
he
there
could
be
for
him
nothing
but
distress
if
the
best
was
not
done
even
though
it
meant
the
loss
of
personal
opportunity
but
it
is
one
of
the
happy
things
of
genius
that
this
exquisite
humility
can
only
live
with
great
creative
gifts
so
that
lovat
fraser
knew
from
day
to
day
the
supreme
joy
of
mastery
the
humility
however
is
our
example
and
the
thought
that
seems
most
worthy
is
that
he
stands
at
this
moment
for
all
he
was
younger
than
most
of
us
as
a
challenging
leader
to
us
all
it
will
i
think
always
be
impossible
to
remember
him
without
feeling
that
anything
mean
or
grudging
in
the
spirit
in
which
we
do
our
work
is
a
betrayal
and
an
intolerable
thing
with
all
his
gaiety
his
fun
his
simplicities
and
his
powers
he
showed
us
not
only
what
a
fine
artist
can
do
but
what
a
fine
artist
can
be
and
under
his
leadership
at
this
moment
may
we
not
go
back
to
our
work
in
the
world
with
renewed
courage
and
faith
we
few
we
happy
few
we
band
of
brothers
for
his
fame
none
of
us
have
any
fear
there
is
in
his
public
achievement
and
his
portfolios
a
solid
body
of
work
that
more
and
more
must
establish
itself
however
futile
prophecy
in
these
things
must
be
one
is
confident
that
a
hundred
years
hence
his
name
will
be
highly
honoured
among
the
little
band
who
helped
to
bring
back
some
life
and
truth
to
the
english
theatre
of
this
age
he
would
wish
for
nothing
better
than
that
and
idle
though
it
is
to
ask
what
his
death
at
little
more
than
youth
may
mean
in
the
way
of
loss
to
the
art
that
he
lived
for
his
friends
know
that
as
dear
a
life
as
any
of
our
time
has
gone
suddenly
inexplicably
taking
with
it
the
tenderest
love
of
every
one
who
knew
him
and
he
leaves
with
us
an
example
without
any
stain

hammersmith
superficially
the
task
of
staging
beggar
was
one
of
supreme
ease
indeed
so
easy
was
it
that
it
became
a
matter
of
some
embarrassment
to
prune
and
select
the
required
amount
of
data
here
was
hogarth
and
his
actual
scene
of
newgate
with
macheath
in
chains
here
was
laroon
of
falling
in
its
edition
of
pat
into
the
period
here
was
the
national
portrait
gallery
and
added
to
these
here
was
the
benefit
of
all
charles
pearce
research
after
a
month
or
two
of
work
in
designing
the
ease
became
so
marked
and
apparent
that
it
engendered
in
me
the
beginnings
of
mistrust
still
i
persevered
in
scene
and
costume
with
historically
accurate
reproduction
and
until
three
weeks
before
the
actual
work
was
due
to
be
carried
out
at
the
costumier
and
in
the
painting
shops
i
felt
comparatively
cheerful
then
i
reviewed
my
forces
the
little
scale
models
of
the
scenes
the
characters
in
painted
cardboard
all
exact
and
accurate
something
was
wrong
and
the
result
was
i
confess
appalling
i
had
not
made
allowances
either
for
my
theatre
or
for
my
audience
i
had
forgotten
that
it
required
a
spacious
georgian
theatre
the
intimacy
of
the
the
great
personages
sitting
on
the
stage
the
duke
of
bolton
major
pauncefoot
and
sir
robert
fagg
were
not
in
their
places
as
in
hogarth
painting
the
pit
would
not
be
filled
with
and
hoops
and
there
would
be
a
sharper
line
of
division
between
the
actors
and
the
spectators
than
ever
existed
in
something
else
had
to
be
done
as
reproduction
was
a
failure
one
would
try
to
give
an
impression
of
the
same
thing
impressionism
proved
even
worse
than
accuracy
it
was
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
it
merged
into
making
a
picture
of
it
a
crime
that
is
without
parallel
in
the
staging
of
a
play
to
make
a
pretty
picture
at
the
expense
of
drama
is
merely
to
pander
to
the
voracity
of
the
costumier
and
footnote
peachum
and
the
beggar
by
charles
pearce
stanley
paul
company
what
was
then
to
be
done
added
to
all
these
objections
was
the
important
fact
that
i
had
designed
scenes
that
would
have
seriously
hampered
the
resources
at
hammersmith
the
theatre
would
have
required
more
space
for
storage
than
could
possibly
have
been
given
and
in
addition
an
army
of
stage
hands
would
be
wanted
for
whom
there
was
not
in
this
little
theatre
the
accommodation
the
solution
was
of
course
to
forget
one
past
work
to
scrap
the
models
and
to
start
feverishly
afresh
the
only
method
left
untried
was
the
symbolic
that
is
to
say
to
hint
at
the
eighteenth
century
and
to
suggest
that
through
the
doors
on
the
stage
existed
the
london
of
the
scene
demanded
to
be
simple
and
one
which
with
slight
modifications
in
doors
and
windows
remained
before
the
audience
for
the
whole
action
of
the
play
it
was
therefore
to
be
a
scene
of
which
people
did
not
easily
tire
and
that
remained
interesting
unobtrusive
and
formally
neat
to
find
such
a
scene
it
is
necessary
to
refer
back
to
days
when
the
comic
and
the
tragic
scenes
were
architectural
and
permanent
this
i
did
and
taking
palladio
magnificent
scene
at
vicenza
by
a
shameless
process
of
ad
evolved
the
scene
that
is
now
in
use
at
hammersmith
palladio
and
gay
have
much
to
forgive
so
far
the
scene
but
it
called
for
a
corresponding
treatment
in
the
dresses
in
beggar
no
one
is
in
the
height
of
fashion
macheath
and
certain
ladies
of
the
town
alone
keep
company
with
lords
and
gentlemen
and
even
then
there
must
have
been
apparent
a
distinction
macheath
is
unaltered
here
it
was
essential
to
keep
to
tradition
macheath
in
a
blue
coat
is
unthinkable
the
rest
of
the
characters
are
frankly
in
the
neighbourhood
of
newgate
the
clothes
of
peachum
and
lockit
would
be
as
equally
unfashionable
and
just
as
possible
thirty
years
before
as
thirty
years
after
whilst
the
footpads
are
clad
in
whatever
georgian
rags
that
happened
to
come
their
way
with
the
women
i
have
taken
greater
licence
i
have
kept
faithfully
to
the
outlines
of
the
age
the
bodice
the
flat
hoops
the
shoes
but
i
have
taken
considerable
liberties
in
the
manner
in
which
i
have
shorn
them
of
ribbons
and
laces
and
for
the
sake
of
dramatic
simplicity
be
it
remembered
i
have
eliminated
yards
of
trimming
just
so
much
explanation
is
i
consider
due
to
the
public
but
whether
i
have
been
justified
by
results
or
whether
under
the
sacred
mask
of
drama
i
have
erred
unpardonably
are
points
which
so
long
as
this
revival
draws
attention
to
a
forgotten
masterpiece
can
be
of
no
very
great
importance

if

be

i

of

which
is
more
than
most

can
say
as
we
live
by

it
is
but
gratitude
in
us
to
encourage
poetical
merit
wherever
we
find
it
the

contrary
to
all

pay
no

never

mistake

so
though
you
are
in
want
i
wish
you
success
heartily
this
piece
i
own
was
originally
writ
for
the
celebrating
the
marriage
of
and
two
most
excellent
i
have
introduced
the
similes
that
are
in
all
your
celebrated
the
the
the
the
the
besides
i
have
a
which
the
ladies
always
reckon
charmingly
pathetic
as
to
the
parts
i
have
observed
such
a
nice
impartiality
to
our
two
ladies
that
it
is
impossible
for
either
of
them
to
take
offence
i
hope
i
may
be
forgiven
that
i
have
not
made
my
opera
throughout
unnatural
like
those
in
vogue
for
i
have
no
recitative
excepting
this
as
i
have
consented
to
have
neither
prologue
nor
epilogue
it
must
be
allowed
an
opera
in
all
its
forms
the
piece
indeed
hath
been
heretofore
frequently
represented
by
ourselves
in
our
great
room
at
so
that
i
can
not
too
often
acknowledge
your
charity
in
bringing
it
now
on
the
stage
but
i
see
it
is
time
for
us
to
withdraw
the
actors
are

an
old
woman
clothed
in
gray
music
through
all
the
employments
of
life
each
neighbour
abuses
his
brother
whore
and
rogue
they
call
husband
and

all
professions
one

the
priest
calls
the
lawyer
a
cheat
the
lawyer
the
divine
and
the
statesman
because
he
so
great
thinks
his
trade
as
honest
as
mine
a
lawyer
is
an
honest
employment
so
is
mine
like
me
too
he
acts
in
a
double
capacity
both
against
rogues
and
for
for
is
but
fitting
that
we
should
protect
and
encourage
cheats
since
we
live
by
them
enter
sir
hath
sent
word
her
trial
comes
on
in
the
afternoon
and
she
hopes
you
will
order
matters
so
as
to
bring
her
off
as
the
wench
is
very
active
and
industrious
you
may
satisfy
her
that
i
soften
the
evidence
sir
is
found
guilty
a
lazy
dog
when
i
took
him
the
time
before
i
told
him
what
he
would
come
to
if
he
did
not
mend
his
hand
this
is
death
without
reprieve
i
may
venture
to
book
him
writes
for
forty
pounds
let
know
that
i
save
her
from
transportation
for
i
can
get
more
by
her
staying
in
hath
brought
more
goods
into
our
lock
than
any
five
of
the
gang
and
in
truth
is
a
pity
to
lose
so
good
a
customer
if
none
of
the
gang
take
her
off
she
may
in
the
common
course
of
business
live
a
longer
i
love
to
let
women
scape
a
good
sportsman
always
lets
the
hen
partridges
fly
because
the
breed
of
the
game
depends
upon
them
besides
here
the
law
allows
us
no
reward
there
is
nothing
to
be
got
by
the
death
of
women
except
our
wives
without
dispute
she
is
a
fine
woman
was
to
her
i
was
obliged
for
my
education
and
to
say
a
bold
word
she
hath
trained
up
more
young
fellows
to
the
business
than
the
gaming
table
truly
thy
observation
is
right
we
and
the
surgeons
are
more
beholden
to
women
than
all
the
professions
besides
air
ii
the
bonny
morn
music
is
woman
that
seduces
all
mankind
by
her
we
first
were
taught
the
wheedling
arts
her
very
eyes
can
cheat
when
most
she
kind
she
tricks
us
of
our
money
with
our
hearts
for
her
like
wolves
by
night
we
roam
for
prey
and
practise
fraud
to
bribe
her
charms
for
suits
of
love
like
law
are
won
by
pay
and
beauty
must
be
fee
into
our
arms
but
make
haste
to
boy
and
let
my
friends
know
what
i
intend
for
i
love
to
make
them
easy
one
way
or
other
when
a
gentleman
is
long
kept
in
suspence
penitence
may
break
his
spirit
ever
after
besides
certainty
gives
a
man
a
good
air
upon
his
trial
and
makes
him
risk
another
without
fear
or
scruple
but
away
for
is
a
pleasure
to
be
the
messenger
of
comfort
to
friends
in
affliction
exit
but
is
now
high
time
to
look
about
me
for
a
decent
execution
against
next
sessions
i
hate
a
lazy
rogue
by
whom
one
can
get
nothing
he
is
hang
a
register
of
the
gang
reading
a
year
and
a
half
in
the
service
let
me
see
how
much
the
stock
owes
to
his
industry
one
two
three
four
five
gold
watches
and
seven
silver
ones
a
mighty
fellow
sixteen
five
of
them
of
true
gold
six
dozen
of
handkerchiefs
four
swords
half
a
dozen
of
shirts
three
and
a
piece
of
considering
these
are
only
the
fruits
of
his
leisure
hours
i
do
know
a
prettier
fellow
for
no
man
alive
hath
a
more
engaging
presence
of
mind
upon
the
road
alias
an
irregular
dog
who
hath
an
underhand
way
of
disposing
of
his
goods
i
try
him
only
for
a
sessions
or
two
longer
upon
his
a
poor
rascal
without
the
least
genius
that
fellow
though
he
were
to
live
these
six
months
will
never
come
to
the
gallows
with
any
credit
slippery
he
goes
off
the
next
sessions
for
the
villain
hath
the
impudence
to
have
views
of
following
his
trade
as
a
tailor
which
he
calls
an
honest
employment
of
the
listed
not
above
a
month
ago
a
promising
sturdy
fellow
and
diligent
in
his
way
somewhat
too
bold
and
hasty
and
may
raise
good
contributions
on
the
public
if
he
does
not
cut
himself
short
by
murder
a
guzzling
soaking
sot
who
is
always
too
drunk
to
stand
himself
or
to
make
others
stand
a
cart
is
absolutely
necessary
for
him
of
alias
alias
alias
alias
enter
what
of
husband
i
hope
nothing
bad
hath
betided
him
you
know
my
dear
he
a
favourite
customer
of
mine
was
he
made
me
a
present
of
this
ring
i
have
set
his
name
down
in
the
black
list
that
all
my
dear
he
spends
his
life
among
women
and
as
soon
as
his
money
is
gone
one
or
other
of
the
ladies
will
hang
him
for
the
reward
and
forty
pound
lost
to
us
you
know
my
dear
i
never
meddle
in
matters
of
death
i
always
leave
those
affairs
to
you
women
indeed
are
bitter
bad
judges
in
these
cases
for
they
are
so
partial
to
the
brave
that
they
think
every
man
handsome
who
is
going
to
the
camp
or
the
gallows
air
iii
cold
and
raw
music
if
any
wench
girdle
wear
though
she
be
never
so
ugly
lilies
and
roses
will
quickly
appear
and
her
face
look
smugly
beneath
the
left
ear
so
fit
but
a
cord
a
rope
so
charming
a
zone
is
the
youth
in
his
cart
hath
the
air
of
a
lord
and
we
cry
there
dies
an
but
really
husband
you
should
not
be
too
for
you
never
had
a
finer
braver
set
of
men
than
at
present
we
have
not
had
a
murder
among
them
all
these
seven
months
and
truly
my
dear
that
is
a
great
blessing
what
a
dickens
is
the
woman
always
a
whimpring
about
murder
for
no
gentleman
is
ever
look
upon
the
worse
for
killing
a
man
in
his
own
defence
and
if
business
can
not
be
carried
on
without
it
what
would
you
have
a
gentleman
do
if
i
am
in
the
wrong
my
dear
you
must
excuse
me
for
no
body
can
help
the
frailty
of
an
conscience
murder
is
as
fashionable
a
crime
as
a
man
can
be
guilty
of
how
many
fine
gentlemen
have
we
in
every
year
purely
upon
that
article
if
they
have
wherewithal
to
persuade
the
jury
to
bring
it
in
manslaughter
what
are
they
the
worse
for
it
so
my
dear
have
done
upon
this
subject
was
captain
here
this
morning
for
the
he
left
with
you
last
week
yes
my
dear
and
though
the
bank
hath
stopt
payment
he
was
so
chearful
and
so
agreeable
sure
there
is
not
a
finer
gentleman
upon
the
road
than
the
captain
if
he
comes
from
at
any
reasonable
hour
he
hath
promis
to
make
one
this
evening
with
and
me
and
at
a
party
of
quadrille
pray
my
dear
is
the
captain
rich
the
captain
keeps
too
good
company
ever
to
grow
rich
and
the
are
his
undoing
the
man
that
proposes
to
get
money
by
play
should
have
the
education
of
a
fine
gentleman
and
be
train
up
to
it
from
his
youth
really
i
am
sorry
upon
account
the
captain
hath
not
more
discretion
what
business
hath
he
to
keep
company
with
lords
and
gentlemen
he
should
leave
them
to
prey
upon
one
another
upon
account
what
a
plague
does
the
woman
mean
upon
account
captain
is
very
fond
of
the
girl
and
what
then
if
i
have
any
skill
in
the
ways
of
women
i
am
sure
thinks
him
a
very
pretty
man
and
what
then
you
would
not
be
so
mad
to
have
the
wench
marry
him
gamesters
and
highwaymen
are
generally
very
good
to
their
whores
but
they
are
very
devils
to
their
wives
but
if
should
be
in
love
how
should
we
help
her
or
how
can
she
help
herself
poor
girl
i
am
in
the
utmost
concern
about
her
air
iv
why
is
your
faithful
slave
disdain
music
if
love
the
virgin
heart
invade
how
like
a
moth
the
simple
maid
still
plays
about
the
flame
if
soon
she
be
not
made
a
wife
her
honour
sing
and
then
for
life
she
what
i
dare
not
name
look
ye
wife
a
handsome
wench
in
our
way
of
business
is
as
profitable
as
at
the
bar
of
a
who
looks
upon
it
as
her
livelihood
to
grant
every
liberty
but
one
you
see
i
would
indulge
the
girl
as
far
as
prudently
we
can
in
any
thing
but
marriage
after
that
my
dear
how
shall
we
be
safe
are
we
not
then
in
her
husband
power
for
a
husband
hath
the
absolute
power
over
all
a
secrets
but
her
own
if
the
girl
had
the
discretion
of
a
who
can
have
a
dozen
young
fellows
at
her
ear
without
complying
with
one
i
should
not
matter
it
but
is
tinder
and
a
spark
will
at
once
set
her
on
a
flame
married
if
the
wench
does
not
know
her
own
profit
sure
she
knows
her
own
pleasure
better
than
to
make
herself
a
property
my
daughter
to
me
should
be
like
a
to
a
minister
of
state
a
key
to
the
whole
gang
married
if
the
affair
is
not
already
done
i
terrify
her
from
it
by
the
example
of
our
neighbours
my
dear
you
may
injure
the
girl
she
loves
to
imitate
the
fine
ladies
and
she
may
only
allow
the
captain
liberties
in
the
view
of
interest
but
is
your
duty
my
dear
to
warn
the
girl
against
her
ruin
and
to
instruct
her
how
to
make
the
most
of
her
beauty
i
go
to
her
this
moment
and
sift
her
in
the
meantime
wife
rip
out
the
coronets
and
marks
of
these
dozen
of
cambric
handkerchiefs
for
i
can
dispose
of
them
this
afternoon
to
a
chap
in
the
city
exit
never
was
a
man
more
out
of
the
way
in
an
argument
than
my
husband
why
must
our
forsooth
differ
from
her
sex
and
love
only
her
husband
and
why
must
marriage
contrary
to
all
observations
make
her
the
less
followed
by
other
men
all
men
are
thieves
in
love
and
like
a
woman
the
better
for
being
property
air
of
all
the
simple
things
we
do
music
a
maid
is
like
the
golden
ore
which
hath
guineas
intrinsical
i
whose
worth
is
never
known
before
it
is
try
and
imprest
in
the
mint
a
wife
like
a
guinea
in
gold
stampt
with
the
name
of
her
spouse
now
here
now
there
is
bought
or
is
sold
and
is
current
in
every
house
enter
come
hither
i
am
as
fond
of
this
child
as
though
my
mind
misgave
me
he
were
my
own
he
hath
as
fine
a
hand
at
picking
a
pocket
as
a
woman
and
is
as
as
a
juggler
if
an
unlucky
session
does
not
cut
the
rope
of
thy
life
i
pronounce
boy
thou
wilt
be
a
great
man
in
history
where
was
your
post
last
night
my
boy
i
ply
at
the
opera
madam
and
considering
was
neither
dark
nor
rainy
so
that
there
was
no
great
hurry
in
getting
chairs
and
coaches
made
a
tolerable
hand
o
these
seven
handkerchiefs
madam
colour
ones
i
see
they
are
of
sure
sale
from
our
warehouse
at
among
the
seamen
and
this
set
in
gold
a
pretty
encouragement
this
to
a
young
beginner
i
had
a
fair
tug
at
a
charming
gold
watch
pox
take
the
tailors
for
making
the
fobs
so
deep
and
narrow
it
stuck
by
the
way
and
i
was
forc
to
make
my
escape
under
a
coach
really
madam
i
fear
i
shall
be
cut
off
in
the
flower
of
my
youth
so
that
every
now
and
then
since
i
was
pumpt
i
have
thoughts
of
taking
up
and
going
to
sea
you
should
go
to
in
the
and
to
child
to
learn
valour
these
are
the
schools
that
have
bred
so
many
brave
men
i
thought
boy
by
this
time
thou
hadst
lost
fear
as
well
as
shame
poor
lad
how
little
does
he
know
as
yet
of
the
for
the
first
fact
i
insure
thee
from
being
hang
and
going
to
sea
will
come
time
enough
upon
a
sentence
of
transportation
but
now
since
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
go
to
your
book
and
learn
your
catechism
for
really
a
man
makes
but
an
ill
figure
in
the
ordinary
paper
who
can
not
give
a
satisfactory
answer
to
his
questions
but
hark
you
my
lad
do
tell
me
a
lye
for
you
know
i
hate
a
liar
do
you
know
of
anything
that
hath
pass
between
captain
and
our
i
beg
you
madam
do
ask
me
for
i
must
either
tell
a
lye
to
you
or
to
miss
for
i
promis
her
i
would
not
tell
but
when
the
honour
of
our
family
is
concern
i
shall
lead
a
sad
life
with
miss
if
ever
she
comes
to
know
that
i
told
you
besides
i
would
not
willingly
forfeit
my
own
honour
by
betraying
any
body
yonder
comes
my
husband
and
come
you
shall
go
with
me
into
my
own
room
and
tell
me
the
whole
story
give
thee
a
glass
of
a
most
delicious
cordial
that
i
keep
for
my
own
drinking
exeunt
enter
i
know
as
well
as
any
of
the
fine
ladies
how
to
make
the
most
of
myself
and
of
my
man
too
a
woman
knows
how
to
be
mercenary
though
she
hath
never
been
in
a
court
or
at
an
assembly
we
have
it
in
our
natures
papa
if
i
allow
captain
some
trifling
liberties
i
have
this
watch
and
other
visible
marks
of
his
favour
to
shew
for
it
a
girl
who
can
not
grant
some
things
and
refuse
what
is
most
material
will
make
but
a
poor
hand
of
her
beauty
and
soon
be
thrown
upon
the
common
air
vi
what
shall
i
do
to
shew
how
much
i
love
her
music
virgins
are
like
the
fair
flower
in
its
lustre
which
in
the
garden
enamels
the
ground
near
it
the
bees
in
play
flutter
and
cluster
and
gaudy
butterflies
frolick
around
but
when
once
pluck
is
no
longer
alluring
to
is
sent
as
yet
sweet
there
fades
and
shrinks
and
grows
past
all
enduring
rots
stinks
and
dies
and
is
trod
under
feet
you
know
i
am
not
against
your
toying
and
trifling
with
a
customer
in
the
way
of
business
or
to
get
out
a
secret
or
so
but
if
i
find
out
that
you
have
play
the
fool
and
are
married
you
jade
you
i
cut
your
throat
hussy
now
you
know
my
mind
enter
in
a
very
great
passion
air
vii
oh
is
a
fine

it
would
not
have
vex
me
for
that
might
have
been
your
misfortune
but
to
do
such
a
mad
thing
by
choice
the
wench
is
married
husband
married
the
captain
is
a
bold
man
and
will
risk
any
thing
for
money
to
be
sure
he
believes
her
a

i
knew
she
was
always
a
proud
slut
and
now
the
wench
hath
play
the
fool

forsooth
she
would
do
like
the

can
you
support
the
expence
of
a

hussy

whoring
have
you
money
enough
to
carry
on
the
daily
quarrels
of

squander

there
are
not

husbands

wives
who
can
bear
the
charges
of
plaguing
one
another
in
a
handsom
way
if
you
must
be
married
could
you
introduce
no
body
into
our
family

a
highwayman
why
thou
foolish
jade
thou
wilt
be
as
and
as
much
neglected
as
if
thou
hadst
married
a
lord
let
not
your
anger
my
dear
break
through
the
rules
of
decency
for
the
captain
looks
upon
himself
in
the
military
capacity
as
a
gentleman
by
his
profession
besides
what
he
hath
already
i
know
he
is
in
a
fair
way
of
getting
or
of
dying
and
both
these
ways
let
me
tell
you
are
most
excellent
chances
for
a
wife
tell
me
hussy
are
you
ruin
or
no

she
might
very
well
have
gone
off
to
a
person
of
distinction
yes
that
you
might
you
pouting
slut
what
is
the
wench
dumb
speak
or
i
make
you
plead
by
squeezing
out
an
answer
from
you
are
you
really
bound
wife
to
him

are
you
only
upon
liking
pinches
her

screaming
how
the
mother
is
to
be
pitied
who
hath
handsom
daughters
locks
bolts
bars

lectures
of
morality

nothing
to
them
they
break
through
them
all
they
have
as
much
pleasure
in
cheating
a
father
and
mother
as
in
cheating
at
cards
why
i
shall
soon
know

you
are

keeping
from
our

grim

me
so
closely
he

that
i
must
have
comply
so
i
thought
it
both
safest
and
best
to
marry
for

you
should
chide
then
all
the
hopes
of
our
family
are
gone
for
ever

may
hang
his

in
hope
to
get

i
did
not
marry
him
as
is
the
fashion
coolly

deliberately
for
honour

him

your

the
poor

takes
it
to

goes
out

returns
with

ah

now
this
is
the
only
comfort
your

has
left
give
her
another
glass
sir
my
mama
drinks
double
the
quantity

you
see
fetches
her
the

you

you
sorry
slut
a
word
with

is
no
new
thing
for
a
wench
to
take
man
without
consent

you
know
is
the
frailty
of
women
my
dear
yes
indeed
the
sex
is
frail
but
the
first
time
a
woman
is
frail
she
should
be
somewhat
nice
methinks
for
then
or
never
is
the
time
to
make
her
fortune
after
that
she
hath
nothing
to
do
but
to
guard
herself
from
being
found
out
and
she
may
do
what
she
pleases
make
yourself
a
little
easy
i
have
a
thought
shall
soon
set
all
matters
again
to

why
so
melancholy
since
what
is
done
can
not
be
undone
we
must
all
endeavour
to
make
the
best
of
it
well
as
far
as
one
woman
can
forgive
another
i
forgive
thee
your
father
is
too
fond
of
you
hussy

all
my
sorrows

up
a

it
a

my

hath
not
such
a
contempt

as
you
imagine
i
tell
you
wife
i
can
make
this
match
turn
to
our
advantage
i
am
very
sensible
husband
that
captain
is
worth
money
but
i
am
in
doubt
whether
he
hath
not
two
or
three
wives
already
and
then
if
he
should
die
in
a
session
or
two
dower
would
come
into

indeed
is
a
point

very
thought

it
fie
what
hath
murder
to
do
in

since
the
thing
sooner

later
must
happen
i
dare
say
the
captain
himself
would
like
that
we
should
get
the
reward
for
his
death
sooner
than
a
stranger
why
the
captain
knows
that
as
is
his
employment
to
rob
so
ours
to
take
robbers

man
in

so
that
there

uncommon

of
late
years
i
have
been
a
great
sufferer
by
the
parliament
three
thousand
pounds
would
hardly
make
me
amends
the
act
for
destroying
the
mint
was
a
severe
cut
upon
our
business
then
if
a
customer
stept
out
of
the
way
we
knew
where
to
have
her
no

you
know
there
a
wench
now
with
a
good
suit
of
clothes
of
mine
upon
her
back
and
i
could
never
set
eyes
upon
her
for
three
months
together
since
the
act
too
against
imprisonment
for
small
sums
my
loss
there
too
hath
been
very
considerable
and
it
must
be
so
when
a
lady
can
borrow
a
handsom
petticoat
or
a
clean
gown
and
i
not
have
the
least
hank
upon
her
and
o
my
conscience
most
ladies
take
a
delight
in
cheating
when
they
can
do
it
with
safety
madam
you
had
a
handsom
gold
watch
of
us
day
for
seven
guineas
considering
we
must
have
our
profit
to
a
gentleman
upon
the
road
a
gold
watch
will
be
scarce
worth
the
taking
consider
that
watch
was
remarkable
and
not
of
very
safe
sale
if
you
have
any
black
velvet
scarfs
they
are
a
handsom
and
take
with
most
gentlemen
who
deal
with
my
customers
is
i
that
put
the
ladies
upon
a
good
foot
is
not
youth
or
beauty
that
fixes
their
price
the
gentlemen
always
pay
according
to
their
dress
from
half
a
crown
to
two
guineas
and
yet
those
hussies
make
nothing
of
bilking

me

too
allowing
for

fine
customers
now

great

as
i
remember
you
said
something
just
now
of
yes
sir
to
be

i
stript
her
of
a
suit
of
my
own
clothes
about
two
hours
ago
and
have
left
her
as
she
should
be
in
her
shift
with
a
lover
of
hers
at
my
house
she
call
him
up

he
was
going
to
in
a
hackney
coach

i
hope
for
her
own
sake
and
mine
she
will
persuade
the
captain
to
redeem
her

you
shall

your

half
a

all
at
your
service
will
you
give
me
leave
to
make
you
a
present
of
this
suit
of
for
your
own
wearing
but
are
you
sure
it
is
captain
though
he
thinks
i
have
forgot
him
no
body
knows
him
better
i
have
taken
a
great
deal
of

captain
money

he
always
lov
to
have
his
ladies
well
drest
and
i
have
a
little
business
with
the
captain
you
understand
me
and
we
will
satisfy
you
for

depend
upon
it
we
will
deal
like
men
of
honour
i
do
enquire
after
your
affairs
so
whatever
happens
i
wash
my

it
hath
always

my
maxim
that
one

should
assist
another
but
if
you

i

dear
madam
your
servant
i
hope
you
will
pardon
my
passion
when
i
was
so
happy
to
see
you
last
i
was
so
with
the
spleen
that
i
was
perfectly
out
of
myself
and
really
when
one
hath
the
spleen
every
thing
is
to
be
excus
by
a
friend
air
xlvii
now
i
tell
thee
because
thou
my
son
music
when
a
wife
in
her
pout
as
she
sometimes
no
doubt
the
good
husband
as
meek
as
a
lamb
her
vapours
to
still
first
grants
her
her
will
and
the
quieting
draught
is
a
dram
poor
man
and
the
quieting
draught
is
a
dram
i
wish
all
our
quarrels
might
have
so
comfortable
a
reconciliation
i
have
no
excuse
for
my
own
behaviour
madam
but
my
misfortunes
and
really
madam
i
suffer
too
upon
your
account
but
miss
in
the
way
of
friendship
will
you
give
me
leave
to
propose
a
glass
of
cordial
to
you
are
apt
to
give
me
the
i
hope
madam
you
will
excuse
me
not
the
greatest
lady
in
the
land
could
have
better
in
her
closet
for
her
own
private
drinking
you
seem
mighty
low
in
spirits
my
dear
i
am
sorry
madam
my
health
will
not
allow
me
to
accept
of
your
offer
i
should
not
have
left
you
in
the
rude
manner
i
did
when
we
met
last
madam
had
not
my
papa
haul
me
away
so
unexpectedly
i
was
indeed
somewhat
provok
and
perhaps
might
use
some
expressions
that
were
disrespectful
but
really
madam
the
captain
treated
me
with
so
much
contempt
and
cruelty
that
i
deserv
your
pity
rather
than
your
resentment
but
since
his
escape
no
doubt
all
matters
are
made
up
again
ah
is
i
am
the
unhappy
wife
and
he
loves
you
as
if
you
were
only
his
mistress
sure
madam
you
can
not
think
me
so
happy
as
to
be
the
object
of
your
jealousy
a
man
is
always
afraid
of
a
woman
who
loves
him
too
well
so
that
i
must
expect
to
be
neglected
and
avoided
then
our
cases
my
dear
are
exactly
alike
both
of
us
indeed
have
been
too
fond
air
xlviii
o
music
a
curse
attend
that
woman
love
who
always
would
be
pleasing
the
pertness
of
the
billing
dove
like
tickling
is
but
teazing
what
then
in
love
can
woman
do
if
we
grow
fond
they
shun
us
and
when
we
fly
them
they
pursue
but
leave
us
when
they
won
us
love
is
so
very
whimsical
in
both
sexes
that
it
is
impossible
to
be
lasting
but
my
heart
is
particular
and
contradicts
my
own
observation
but
really
mistress
by
his
last
behaviour
i
think
i
ought
to
envy
you
when
i
was
forc
from
him
he
did
not
shew
the
least
tenderness
but
perhaps
he
hath
a
heart
not
capable
of
it
air
xlix
would
fate
to
me
give
music
among
the
men
coquettes
we
find
who
court
by
turns
all
and
we
grant
all
their
hearts
desir
when
they
are
flatter
and
admir
the
coquettes
of
both
sexes
are
and
that
is
a
love
no
other
whatever
can
dispossess
i
hear
my
dear
our
husband
is
one
of
those
away
with
these
melancholy
reflections
indeed
my
dear
we
are
both
of
us

proof

the
best

to

to
make
the
piece
perfect
i
was
for
doing
strict
poetical
justice
is
to

for
the
other
personages
of
the
drama
the
audience
must
have
suppos
they
were
all
either
hang
or
transported
why
then
friend
this
is
a
downright
deep
tragedy
the
catastrophe
is
manifestly
wrong
for
an
opera
must
end
happily
your
objection
sir
is
very
just
and
is
easily
remov
for
you
must
allow
that
in
this
kind
of
drama
is
no
matter
how
absurdly
things
are
brought
about
so
you
rabble
there
run
and
cry
a
reprieve
let
the
prisoner
be
brought
back
to
his
wives
in
triumph
all
this
we
must
do
to
comply
with
the
taste
of
the
town
through
the
whole
piece
you
may
observe
such
a
similitude
of
manners
in
high
and
low
life
that
it
is
difficult
to
determine
whether
in
the
fashionable
vices
the
fine
gentlemen
imitate
the
gentlemen
of
the
road
or
the
gentlemen
of
the
road
the
fine
gentlemen
had
the
play
remained
as
i
at
first
intended
it
would
have
carried
a
most
excellent
moral
have
shewn
that
the
lower
sort
of
people
have
their
vices
in
a
degree
as
well
as
the
rich
and
that
they
are
for
them

so
it
seems
i
am
not
left
to
my
choice

must
have
a

look
ye
my
dears
we
will
have
no

now
let
us
give

will
testify
her

leave

a

gold
watch
of

thee
thus
distracts

book
appears
to
be
a
copy
of
the
original
retaining
or
adding
assorted
minor
errors
in
particular
the
use
of
double
bar
lines
or
repeats
seems
to
be
almost
entirely
arbitrary
in
the
pdf
and
midi
files
obvious
errors
such
as
missing
dots
after
notes
have
been
corrected
and
a
few
ties
have
been
added
repeats
are
used
only
when
required
by
the
lyrics
as
printed
all
music
files
including
the
pdf
images
are
in
the
music
directory
in
addition
to
individual
airs

are
pdf
files
containing
the
collected
songs
for
each
scene
that
has
more
than
one
song

the
final
song
has
been
omitted
because
it
takes
up
a
complete
page
by
itself

smaller
