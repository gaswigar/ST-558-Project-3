bleak
the
managing
editor
of
the
evening
balloon
sat
at
his
desk
in
the
center
of
the
under
a
furious
cone
of
electric
light
it
was
six
of
a
warm
summer
afternoon
he
was
filling
his
pipe
and
turning
over
the
pages
of
the
final
edition
of
the
paper
which
had
just
come
up
from
the
after
the
turmoil
of
the
day
the
room
had
quieted
most
of
the
reporters
had
left
and
the
shaded
lamps
shone
upon
empty
tables
and
a
floor
strewn
with
papers
nearby
sat
the
city
editor
checking
over
the
list
of
assignments
for
the
next
morning
from
an
adjoining
kennel
issued
occasional
deep
groans
and
a
strong
whiff
of
savage
shag
tobacco
blown
outward
by
the
droning
gust
of
an
electric
fan
these
proved
that
the
cartoonist
a
man
whose
sprightly
drawings
were
born
to
an
obbligato
of
vehement
blasphemy
was
at
work
within
mr
bleak
was
just
beginning
to
recuperate
from
the
incessant
vigilance
of
the
day
work
there
was
an
unconscious
pathos
in
his
lean
desiccated
figure
as
he
rose
and
crossed
the
room
to
the
green
glass
after
the
custom
of
experienced
newspapermen
he
rapidly
twirled
a
makeshift
cup
out
of
a
sheet
of
copy
paper
he
poured
himself
a
draught
of
clear
but
rather
tepid
water
and
drank
it
without
noticeable
relish
his
lifted
head
betrayed
only
the
automatic
thankfulness
of
the
domestic
fowl
there
had
been
a
time
when
six
meant
something
better
than
a
paper
goblet
of
lukewarm
filtration
he
sat
down
at
his
desk
again
he
had
loaded
his
pipe
sedulously
with
an
extra
fine
blend
which
he
kept
in
his
desk
drawer
for
smoking
during
rare
moments
of
relaxation
when
he
had
leisure
to
savor
it
as
he
reached
for
a
match
he
was
meditating
a
genial
remark
to
the
city
editor
when
he
discovered
that
there
was
only
one
tandsticker
in
the
box
he
struck
it
and
the
blazing
head
flew
off
upon
the
thigh
of
his
palm
beach
suit
his
naturally
placid
temper
undermined
by
thirty
years
of
newspaper
work
and
two
years
of
prohibition
flamed
up
also
with
a
loud
scream
of
rage
and
a
curse
against
sweden
he
leaped
to
his
feet
and
shook
the
glowing
cinder
from
his
person
facing
him
he
found
a
stranger
who
had
entered
the
room
quietly
and
unobserved
this
was
a
huge
man
clad
in
a
sober
uniform
of
gray
cloth
with
silver
buttons
and
silver
braid
a
sam
browne
belt
of
wide
blue
leather
marched
across
his
extensive
diagonal
in
a
gentle
curve
the
band
of
his
vizored
military
cap
showed
the
initials
in
silver
embroidery
his
face
broad
and
shone
with
a
lustre
which
was
partly
warmth
and
partly
simple
friendliness
save
for
a
certain
humility
of
bearing
he
might
have
been
taken
for
the
liveried
of
a
theater
or
exclusive
millinery
shop
in
one
hand
he
carried
a
very
large
black
leather
is
this
mr
bleak
he
asked
politely
yes
said
the
editor
in
surprise
his
secret
surmise
was
that
some
one
had
died
and
left
him
a
legacy
which
would
enable
him
to
retire
from
newspaper
work
this
is
the
unacknowledged
dream
that
haunts
many
journalists
mr
bleak
was
wondering
whether
this
was
the
way
in
which
legacies
were
announced
the
man
in
the
gray
uniform
set
the
bag
down
with
great
care
on
the
large
flat
desk
he
drew
out
a
key
and
unlocked
it
before
opening
it
he
looked
round
the
room
the
city
editor
and
three
reporters
were
watching
curiously
a
shy
gayety
twinkled
in
his
clear
blue
eyes
mr
bleak
he
said
you
and
these
other
gentlemen
present
are
men
of
discretion
bleak
made
a
gesture
of
reassurance
the
other
leaned
over
the
and
lifted
the
lid
the
bag
was
divided
into
several
compartments
in
one
the
startled
editor
beheld
a
nest
of
tall
glasses
in
another
a
number
of
interesting
flasks
lying
in
a
porcelain
container
among
chipped
ice
in
the
lid
was
an
array
of
straws
napkins
a
flat
tray
labeled
cloves
and
a
bunch
of
what
looked
uncommonly
like
mint
leaves
mr
bleak
did
not
speak
but
his
pulse
was
disorderly
the
man
in
gray
drew
out
five
tumblers
and
placed
them
on
the
desk
rapidly
several
bottles
caught
the
light
there
was
a
gesture
of
pouring
a
clink
of
ice
and
beneath
the
spellbound
gaze
of
the
watchers
the
glasses
fumed
and
bubbled
with
a
volatile
potion
a
glass
mixing
rod
tinkled
in
the
thin
crystal
shells
and
the
man
of
mystery
deftly
thrust
a
clump
of
foliage
into
each
a
well
known
fragrance
exhaled
upon
the
air
shades
of
the
grail
cried
bleak
mint
julep
the
visitor
bowed
and
pushed
the
glasses
forward
with
the
compliments
of
the
corporation
he
said
the
city
editor
sprang
to
his
feet
sagely
cynical
he
suspected
a
ruse
it
a
plant
he
exclaimed
do
touch
it
it
a
trick
on
the
part
of
the
department
of
justice
trying
to
get
us
into
trouble
bleak
gazed
angrily
at
the
stranger
if
this
was
indeed
a
federal
stratagem
what
an
intolerably
cruel
one
in
front
of
him
the
glasses
sparkled
alluringly
a
delicate
mist
gathered
on
their
curves
a
pungent
sweetness
wavered
in
his
nostrils
see
here
he
blurted
with
shrill
excitement
are
you
a
damned
government
agent
if
so
take
your
poison
and
get
out
the
tall
stranger
in
his
impressive
uniform
stood
erect
and
unabashed
with
affectionate
care
he
gave
the
tumblers
a
final
musical
stir
o
ye
of
little
faith
he
said
calmly
the
sadness
of
the
misunderstood
idealist
grieved
his
features
have
you
forgotten
the
miracle
of
cana
from
his
pocket
he
took
a
card
and
laid
it
on
the
desk
bleak

caraway

virgil

associate
director
he
stared
at
the
pasteboard
stupefied
and
handed
it
to
the
city
editor
meanwhile
the
three
reporters
had
drawn
near
and
irresponsible
souls
unoppressed
by
the
embittered
suspicion
of
their
superiors
they
nosed
the
floating
aroma
with
candid
hilarity
the
breath
of
eden
said
one
it
a
warm
evening
remarked
another
with
seeming
irrelevance
the
face
of
virgil
quimbleton
the
man
in
gray
relaxed
again
at
these
marks
of
honest
appreciation
he
waved
an
encouraging
arm
over
the
crystals
with
the
compliments
of
the
corporation
he
repeated
bleak
and
the
city
editor
looked
again
at
the
card
and
at
each
other
they
scanned
the
face
of
their
mysterious
benefactor
bleak
hand
went
out
to
the
nearest
glass
he
raised
it
to
his
lips
an
formula
recurred
to
him
down
the
he
cried
and
tilted
his
arm
the
others
followed
suit
and
the
associate
director
watched
them
with
a
glow
of
perfect
altruism
the
glasses
were
still
in
air
when
the
cartoonist
emerged
from
his
room
holy
cat
he
cried
in
amazement
what
going
on
he
seized
one
of
the
empty
vessels
and
sniffed
it
treason
he
exclaimed
who
been
robbing
the
mint
maybe
you
can
have
one
too
said
bleak
and
turned
to
where
quimbleton
had
been
standing
but
the
mysterious
visitor
had
leff
the
room
you
too
late
bill
said
the
city
editor
genially
there
was
a
kind
of
messiah
here
but
he
gone
tough
luck
say
boss
suggested
one
of
the
reporters
there
a
story
in
this
may
i
interview
that
guy
bleak
picked
up
the
card
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
a
heavenly
warmth
pervaded
his
mental
fabric
a
story
he
said
forget
it
this
is
no
story
it
a
legend
of
the
dear
dead
past
i
cover
this
assignment
myself
he
borrowed
a
match
and
lit
his
pipe
then
he
put
on
his
coat
and
hat
and
left
the
office
it
was
remarked
by
faithful
readers
of
the
balloon
that
the
next
cartoon
was
one
of
the
least
successful
in
the
history
of
that
brilliant
newspaper
chapter
ii
the
house
on
caraway
street
after
telephoning
to
his
wife
that
he
would
not
be
home
for
supper
bleak
set
out
for
caraway
street
he
was
in
that
exuberant
mood
discernible
in
commuters
unexpectedly
spending
an
evening
in
town
instead
of
hurrying
out
to
the
suburbs
on
the
train
to
mow
the
lawn
and
admire
the
fireflies
here
he
was
watching
the
more
dazzling
fireflies
of
the
city
the
electric
signs
which
were
already
bulbed
wanly
against
the
rich
orange
of
the
falling
sun
he
puffed
his
pipe
lustily
and
with
a
jaunty
condescension
watched
the
crowds
thronging
the
drugstores
for
their
dram
of
soda
in
his
bosom
the
secret
julep
tingled
radiantly
at
that
hour
of
the
evening
the
shining
bustle
of
the
central
streets
was
drawing
the
life
of
the
city
to
itself
in
the
residential
through
which
his
route
took
him
the
pavements
were
nearly
deserted
a
delicious
sense
of
extravagant
adventure
possessed
him
as
a
newspaper
man
he
did
not
feel
at
all
sure
that
he
was
on
the
threshold
of
a
printable
story
but
as
a
connoisseur
of
juleps
he
felt
that
very
possibly
he
was
on
the
threshold
of
another
drink
passing
a
line
of
billboards
he
noticed
a
brightly
colored
poster
advertising
a
brand
of
collars
in
sheer
he
drew
a
soft
pencil
from
his
waistcoat
and
adorned
the
comely
young
man
on
the
collar
poster
with
a
heavy
mustache
caraway
street
with
which
he
had
not
previously
been
familiar
proved
to
be
a
quaint
little
channel
of
old
brick
houses
leading
into
the
bonfire
of
the
summer
sunset
there
was
nothing
to
distinguish
number
from
its
neighbors
he
rang
the
bell
and
there
ensued
a
rapid
clicking
in
the
lock
indicating
that
the
latch
had
been
released
by
some
one
within
he
pushed
the
door
open
and
entered
he
had
a
curious
sensation
of
having
stepped
into
an
old
flemish
painting
the
hall
in
which
he
stood
was
cool
and
rather
dark
though
a
bright
refraction
of
light
tossed
from
some
upper
window
upon
a
tall
mirror
filled
the
shadow
with
broken
spangles
through
an
open
doorway
at
the
rear
was
the
green
glimmer
of
a
garden
in
front
of
him
was
a
mahogany
sideboard
on
its
polished
top
lay
two
books
a
box
of
cigars
and
a
cut
glass
decanter
surrounded
by
several
glasses
in
the
decanter
was
a
pale
yellow
fluid
which
held
a
beam
of
light
the
house
was
completely
silent
somewhat
abashed
he
removed
his
hat
and
stood
irresolute
expecting
some
greeting
but
nothing
happened
on
a
rack
against
the
wall
he
saw
a
gray
uniform
coat
like
that
which
quimbleton
had
worn
in
the
balloon
office
and
a
similar
gray
cap
with
the
silver
monogram
he
glanced
at
the
books
one
was
the
rubaiyat
of
omar
khayyam
the
other
was
a
bible
open
at
the
second
chapter
of
john
he
was
looking
curiously
at
the
decanter
when
a
voice
startled
him
dandelion
wine
it
said
will
you
have
a
glass
he
turned
and
saw
an
old
gentleman
with
profuse
white
hair
and
beard
tottering
into
the
hall
glad
to
see
you
mr
bleak
said
the
latter
i
was
expecting
you
you
are
very
kind
said
the
editor
i
fear
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
i
was
told
that
walt
whitman
died
in
nonsense
wheezed
the
other
with
a
senile
chuckle
he
straightened
ripped
off
his
silver
fringes
and
appeared
as
the
stalwart
quimbleton
himself
forgive
my
precautions
he
said
i
am
surrounded
by
spies
i
have
to
be
careful
should
some
of
my
enemies
learn
that
old
monkbones
of
caraway
street
is
the
same
as
virgil
quimbleton
of
the
happiness
corporation
my
life
would
be
worth
well
a
glass
of
gooseberry
brandy
speaking
of
that
have
a
little
of
the
dandelion
wine
he
pointed
to
the
decanter
bleak
poured
himself
a
glass
and
watched
his
host
carefully
resume
the
hoary
wig
and
whiskers
they
passed
into
the
garden
a
quiet
green
enclosure
surrounded
by
brick
walls
and
bright
with
hollyhocks
and
other
flowers
it
was
overlooked
by
a
quaint
jumble
of
rear
gables
tall
chimneys
and
dormer
windows
do
you
play
croquet
asked
quimbleton
showing
a
neat
pattern
of
white
hoops
fixed
in
the
shaven
turf
if
so
we
must
have
a
game
after
supper
it
very
agreeable
as
a
quiet
relaxation
mr
bleak
was
still
trying
to
get
his
bearings
to
see
this
robust
creature
gravely
counterfeiting
the
posture
of
extreme
old
age
was
almost
too
much
for
his
gravity
there
was
a
bizarre
absurdity
in
the
solemn
way
quimbleton
beamed
out
from
his
frosty
and
fraudulent
shrubbery
something
in
the
air
of
the
garden
also
seemed
to
push
bleak
toward
laughter
he
had
that
sensation
which
we
have
all
experienced
an
unaccountable
desire
to
roar
with
mirth
for
no
very
definite
cause
he
bit
his
lip
and
sought
rigorously
for
decorum
upon
my
soul
he
said
this
is
the
most
fragrant
garden
i
ever
smelt
what
is
that
delicious
odor
in
the
air
that
faint
perfume
that
subtle
sweetness
said
quimbleton
with
unexpected
drollery
exactly
said
bleak
that
abounding
and
pervasive
aroma
that
delicate
bouquet
quite
so
that
breath
of
myrrh
that
balmy
exhalation
bleak
wondered
if
this
was
a
game
he
tried
valiantly
to
continue
precisely
he
said
that
quintessence
of
he
could
coerce
himself
no
longer
and
burst
into
a
yell
of
laughter
hush
said
quimbleton
nervously
some
one
may
be
watching
us
but
the
fragrance
of
the
garden
is
something
i
am
rather
proud
of
you
see
i
water
the
flowers
with
champagne
with
champagne
echoed
bleak
good
heavens
man
you
get
penal
servitude
nonsense
said
quimbleton
the
eighteenth
amendment
says
that
intoxicating
liquors
may
not
be
manufactured
sold
or
transported
for
beverage
purposes
nothing
is
said
about
using
them
to
irrigate
the
garden
i
have
a
friend
who
makes
this
champagne
himself
and
gives
me
some
of
it
for
my
if
you
spray
the
flowers
with
it
and
then
walk
round
and
inhale
them
you
get
quite
a
genial
reaction
i
do
it
principally
to
annoy
bishop
chuff
you
see
he
lives
next
door
bishop
chuff
of
the
yes
said
quimbleton
but
do
shout
his
garden
adjoins
this
he
has
a
periscope
that
overlooks
my
quarters
that
why
i
have
to
wear
this
disguise
in
the
garden
i
think
he
getting
a
bit
suspicious
i
manage
to
cause
him
a
good
deal
of
suffering
with
the
fizz
fumes
from
my
garden
jolly
idea
is
it
bleak
was
aghast
at
the
temerity
of
the
man
bishop
chuff
the
fanatical
leader
of
the
league
jocosely
known
as
the
was
the
most
feared
man
in
america
it
was
he
whose
untiring
organization
had
forced
prohibition
through
the
legislatures
of
forty
states
had
closed
the
golf
links
on
sundays
had
made
it
a
misdemeanor
to
be
found
laughing
in
public
and
here
was
this
daring
quimbleton
living
at
the
very
sill
of
the
lion
den
by
means
of
my
disguise
whispered
quimbleton
i
was
able
to
make
a
pleasant
impression
on
the
bishop
one
evening
i
went
to
call
on
him
i
took
the
precaution
to
eat
a
green
persimmon
beforehand
which
distorted
my
features
into
such
a
malignant
contraction
of
pessimism
and
misanthropy
that
i
quite
won
his
heart
he
accepted
an
invitation
to
play
croquet
with
me
that
afternoon
i
prepared
the
garden
with
a
deluge
of
champagne
the
golden
drops
sparkled
on
every
the
lawn
was
drenched
with
it
after
playing
one
round
the
bishop
was
gloriously
inflamed
he
had
to
be
carried
home
roaring
the
most
unseemly
ditties
since
then
as
i
say
he
has
grown
i
fear
a
trifle
suspicious
but
let
us
have
a
bite
of
supper
more
than
once
as
they
sat
under
a
thickly
leafy
grape
arbor
in
the
quiet
green
enclosure
bleak
had
to
pinch
himself
to
confirm
the
witness
of
his
senses
a
table
was
delicately
spread
with
an
agreeable
repast
of
cold
salmon
asparagus
salad
fruits
jellies
and
whipped
creams
the
flagon
of
dandelion
vintage
played
its
due
part
in
the
repast
and
mr
bleak
began
to
entertain
a
new
respect
for
this
common
flower
of
which
he
had
been
unduly
inappreciative
although
the
trellis
screened
them
from
observation
quimbleton
seemed
ill
at
ease
he
kept
an
alert
gaze
roving
about
him
and
spoke
only
in
whispers
once
when
a
bird
lighted
in
the
foliage
behind
them
causing
a
sudden
stir
among
the
leaves
his
shaggy
beard
whirled
round
with
every
symptom
of
panic
little
by
little
this
apprehension
began
to
infect
the
journalist
also
at
first
he
had
hardly
restrained
his
mirth
at
the
sight
of
this
burly
athlete
framed
in
the
bush
of
santa
claus
now
he
began
to
wonder
whether
his
escapade
had
been
consummated
at
too
great
a
risk
that
quarter
of
the
city
was
incredibly
still
as
the
light
ebbed
slowly
and
broad
blue
shadows
crept
across
the
patch
of
turf
they
sat
in
a
silence
broken
only
by
the
wiry
cheep
of
sparrows
and
the
distant
moan
of
trolley
cars
the
arrows
of
the
decumbent
sun
gilded
the
ripening
grapes
above
them
suddenly
there
were
two
loud
bangs
and
a
vicious
whistle
sang
through
the
arbor
broken
twigs
eddied
down
upon
the
table
cloth
spotted
mackerel
cried
bleak
is
some
one
shooting
at
us
quimbleton
reappeared
presently
from
under
the
table
all
serene
he
said
we
safe
now
that
was
only
chuff
every
night
about
this
time
he
comes
out
on
his
back
gallery
and
enjoys
a
little
he
a
very
good
shot
and
picks
off
the
grapes
that
have
ripened
during
the
day
there
were
only
two
that
were
really
purple
this
evening
so
now
we
can
go
ahead
unless
he
should
send
over
a
raiding
party
we
all
right
the
editor
solaced
himself
with
another
beaker
of
the
dandelion
wine
and
they
finished
their
meal
in
thoughtful
silence
mr
bleak
said
the
other
at
last
it
was
something
more
than
mere
desire
to
give
you
a
pleasant
surprise
that
led
me
to
your
office
this
afternoon
have
you
leisure
to
listen
good
please
try
one
of
these
cigars
if
while
i
am
talking
you
should
hear
any
one
moving
in
the
garden
just
tap
quietly
on
the
table
tell
me
have
you
before
ever
heard
of
the
corporation
for
the
perpetuation
of
happiness
never
replied
bleak
kindling
a
magnifico
of
remarkably
rich
mild
flavor
that
is
as
i
expected
rejoined
quimbleton
we
have
campaigned
incognito
partly
by
choice
and
partly
let
me
be
candid
by
necessity
but
the
time
is
come
when
we
shall
have
to
appear
in
the
open
the
last
great
struggle
is
on
and
it
can
no
longer
be
conducted
in
the
dark
in
the
course
of
my
remarks
i
may
be
tempted
to
forget
our
present
perils
i
beg
of
you
if
you
hear
any
sounds
that
seem
suspicious
to
notify
me
instantly
pardon
me
said
bleak
a
little
uneasily
it
was
my
intention
to
catch
the
train
for
mandrake
park
the
fantastic
cascade
of
false
white
hair
wagged
gravely
in
the
dusk
my
dear
sir
said
quimbleton
solemnly
i
fancy
you
are
to
be
gratified
by
a
far
higher
destiny
than
catching
the
do
me
the
honor
of
filling
your
glass
but
be
careful
not
to
clink
the
decanter
against
the
tumbler
there
is
every
probability
that
vigilant
ears
are
on
the
alert
there
was
a
brief
silence
and
bleak
wondered
a
trifle
wildly
if
he
were
dreaming
the
cigar
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
little
table
glowed
rosily
several
times
and
then
quimbleton
voice
resumed
in
a
deep
undertone
it
is
necessary
to
tell
you
he
said
that
the
corporation
was
founded
a
number
of
years
ago
long
before
the
events
of
the
fatal
year
and
the
eighteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
the
incident
of
this
afternoon
may
have
caused
you
to
think
that
what
is
vulgarly
called
booze
is
the
chief
preoccupation
of
our
society
that
is
not
so
we
were
organized
at
first
simply
to
bring
merriment
and
good
cheer
into
the
lives
of
those
who
have
found
the
vexations
of
modern
life
too
trying
in
our
early
days
we
carried
on
an
excellent
though
unsystematic
guerilla
warfare
against
human
suffering
in
this
let
me
admit
it
frankly
we
were
to
a
great
degree
selfish
as
you
are
aware
the
essence
of
humor
is
surprise
we
found
a
delicious
humor
in
our
campaign
of
surprising
woebegone
humanity
in
moments
of
crisis
for
instance
we
used
to
picket
the
railway
terminals
to
console
commuters
who
had
just
missed
their
trains
we
found
it
uproariously
funny
to
approach
a
perspiring
suburbanite
who
had
missed
the
train
let
us
say
to
mandrake
park
and
to
press
upon
him
with
the
compliments
of
the
corporation
some
consolatory
souvenir
a
box
of
cigars
perhaps
or
a
basket
of
rare
fruit
housewives
groaning
over
their
endless
routine
of
bathing
the
baby
ordering
the
meals
sweeping
the
floors
and
so
on
would
be
amazed
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
one
of
our
deputies
in
the
service
uniform
of
gray
and
silver
equipped
with
vacuum
cleaner
and
electric
machine
to
take
over
the
domestic
chores
for
one
day
the
troubles
of
lovers
were
under
our
special
care
we
saw
how
much
anguish
is
caused
by
the
passion
of
jealousy
many
an
engaged
damsel
tempted
to
mild
escapade
in
some
perfumed
conservatory
found
her
heart
chilled
by
the
stern
eye
of
a
uniformed
agent
lurking
behind
a
potted
hydrangea
we
hired
bands
of
urchins
to
make
faces
at
evil
old
men
who
themselves
in
the
windows
of
clubs
many
a
husband
wondering
desperately
which
hat
or
which
tie
to
select
has
been
surprised
by
the
appearance
of
one
of
our
staff
at
his
elbow
tactfully
pointing
out
which
article
would
best
harmonize
with
his
complexion
and
station
in
life
ladies
who
insisted
on
overpowdering
their
noses
were
quietly
waylaid
by
one
of
our
matrons
and
the
excess
of
removed
a
whole
shipload
of
people
who
persisted
in
eating
onions
were
gathered
without
any
publicity
into
a
concentration
camp
and
in
company
with
several
popular
comedians
deported
to
a
coral
atoll
i
could
enumerate
thousands
of
such
instances
for
several
years
we
worked
in
this
unassuming
way
trying
to
add
to
the
sum
of
human
happiness
quimbleton
white
beard
shone
with
a
pinkish
brightness
as
he
inhaled
heavily
on
his
cigar
now
mr
bleak
he
went
on
i
come
to
you
because
we
need
your
help
we
can
no
longer
maintain
a
sniping
campaign
on
the
enemies
of
human
happiness
this
is
a
death
struggle
you
are
aware
that
chuff
and
his
legions
are
planning
a
tremendous
parade
for
you
know
that
it
will
be
the
most
startling
demonstration
of
its
kind
ever
arranged
one
hundred
thousand
will
parade
on
the
boulevard
with
a
hundred
brass
bands
led
by
the
bishop
himself
on
his
coal
black
horse
do
you
know
the
purpose
of
the
parade
in
a
general
way
said
bleak
i
suppose
it
is
to
give
publicity
to
the
prohibition
cause
they
have
kept
their
malign
scheme
entirely
secret
said
quimbleton
you
as
a
newspaper
man
should
know
it
does
the
cause
of
prohibition
require
publicity
nonsense
prohibition
is
already
in
effect
the
purpose
of
the
parade
is
to
undermine
the
splendid
work
our
corporation
has
been
doing
for
the
past
two
years
as
soon
as
the
fatal
amendment
was
passed
we
set
to
work
to
teach
people
how
to
brew
beverages
of
their
own
in
their
own
homes
as
you
know
very
delicious
wine
may
be
made
from
almost
every
vegetable
and
fruit
potatoes
tomatoes
rhubarb
currants
blackberries
gooseberries
raisins
apples
all
these
are
susceptible
of
fermentation
transforming
their
juices
into
desirable
vintages
we
specialized
on
such
beverages
we
printed
and
distributed
millions
of
recipes
chuff
countered
by
passing
laws
that
no
printed
recipes
could
circulate
through
the
mails
we
had
motion
pictures
filmed
showing
the
eager
public
how
to
perform
these
simple
and
cheering
processes
chuff
thereupon
had
motion
pictures
banned
he
would
abolish
the
principle
of
fermentation
itself
if
he
could
we
composed
a
little
for
dandelion
wine
sending
thousands
of
minstrels
to
sing
it
about
the
country
until
the
people
should
memorize
it
now
chuff
threatens
to
forbid
singing
and
the
memorizing
of
poetry
at
this
moment
he
has
fifty
thousand
zealots
working
in
the
countryside
collecting
and
burning
dandelion
seeds
so
as
to
reduce
the
crop
next
spring
the
purpose
of
his
parade
is
devastating
in
its
simplicity
having
learned
that
wine
may
be
made
from
gooseberries
he
proposes
as
a
first
step
to
abolish
them
altogether
this
is
to
be
the
nineteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
no
gooseberries
shall
be
grown
upon
the
soil
of
the
united
states
or
imported
from
abroad
raisins
too
since
it
is
said
that
one
raisin
in
a
bottle
of
grape
juice
can
cause
it
to
bubble
in
illicit
fashion
are
to
be
put
in
the
category
of
deadly
weapons
any
one
found
carrying
a
concealed
raisin
will
go
before
a
firing
squad
and
chuff
threatens
to
abolish
all
vegetables
of
every
kind
if
necessary
bleak
sat
in
horrified
silence
there
is
another
aspect
of
the
matter
said
quimbleton
that
touches
your
profession
very
closely
bishop
chuff
is
greatly
annoyed
at
the
persistent
use
of
the
printing
press
to
issue
clandestine
vinous
recipes
he
solemnly
threatens
if
this
continues
to
abolish
the
printing
press
this
is
to
be
the
twentieth
amendment
no
printing
press
shall
be
used
in
the
territory
of
the
united
states
any
man
found
with
a
printing
press
concealed
about
his
person
shall
be
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
even
the
congressional
record
is
to
be
written
entirely
by
hand
the
editor
was
unable
to
speak
he
reached
for
the
decanter
but
found
it
empty
very
well
then
said
quimbleton
the
facts
are
before
you
i
suppose
the
evening
balloon
has
made
its
customary
enterprising
preparations
to
report
the
big
parade
why
yes
said
bleak
three
photographers
and
three
of
our
most
brilliant
reporters
have
been
assigned
to
cover
the
event
one
of
the
stories
dealing
with
pathetic
incidents
of
the
procession
has
already
been
written
cases
of
women
swooning
in
the
vast
throng
and
so
on
the
balloon
is
always
first
he
added
by
force
of
habit
i
want
you
to
discard
all
your
plans
for
describing
the
parade
said
quimbleton
i
am
about
to
give
you
the
greatest
scoop
in
the
history
of
journalism
the
procession
will
break
up
in
confusion
all
that
will
be
necessary
to
say
can
be
said
in
half
a
dozen
lines
which
i
will
give
you
now
i
suggest
that
you
print
them
on
your
front
page
in
the
largest
possible
type
from
his
pocket
he
took
a
sheet
of
paper
neatly
folded
and
handed
it
across
the
table
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
asked
bleak
how
can
you
know
what
will
happen
the
corporation
has
spoken
said
his
host
let
us
go
indoors
where
you
can
read
what
i
have
written
in
a
small
handsomely
appointed
library
bleak
opened
the
paper
it
was
a
sheet
of
official
stationery
and
read
as

tremulously

cried
quimbleton
tearing
off
his

in
his
earnestness
then
said
bleak
i
must
get
back
to
the
office
chapter
iii
incident
of
the
gooseberry
bombs
the
day
of
the
great
parade
dawned
dazzling
and
clear
with
every
promise
of
heat
from
the
first
blue
of
morning
while
the
streets
were
still
cool
and
marble
front
steps
moist
from
housemaids
sluicings
crowds
of
bishop
chuff
marchers
came
pouring
into
the
city
at
the
prearranged
mobilization
points
where
bands
were
stationed
to
keep
the
throngs
amused
until
the
immense
procession
could
be
ranged
in
line
the
press
was
terrific
every
trolley
every
suburban
train
every
jitney
was
crammed
with
the
clad
in
white
carrying
the
buttons
ribbons
and
banners
that
had
been
prepared
for
this
great
occasion
down
with
gooseberries
the
new
menace
was
the
terrifying
legend
printed
on
these
emblems
the
boulevard
had
been
roped
off
by
the
police
by
eight
and
the
pavements
were
swarming
with
citizens
many
of
whom
had
camped
there
all
night
in
order
to
witness
this
tremendous
spectacle
as
the
sun
surged
pitilessly
higher
the
temperature
became
painful
the
asphalt
streets
grew
soft
under
the
twingeing
feet
of
the
and
waves
of
heat
radiation
shimmered
along
the
vista
of
the
magnificent
highway
to
keep
themselves
cheerful
the
legions
of
chuff
sang
their
new
gooseberry
anthem
written
by
miss
theodolinda
chuff
the
bishop
daughter
to
the
air
of
marching
through
georgia
the
rousing
strains
rose
in
unison
from
thousands
of
earnest
throats
the
majesty
of
the
song
can
not
be
comprehended
unless
the
reader
will
permit
himself
to
hum
to
the
familiar
tune
root
up
every
gooseberry
where
satan
winks
his
eye
we
will
make
the
sinful
earth
a
credit
by
and
by
europe
may
be
stubborn
but
we
legislate
her
dry
and
then
we
tackle
the
planets
chorus
hurrah
hurrah
we
hurrah
hurrah
an
end
to
joy
we
sing
come
let
make
life
doleful
and
then
death
will
lose
its
sting
happiness
is
only
a
habit
come
then
all
ye
citizens
and
join
our
stern
verein
we
the
ones
that
put
the
crimp
in
whiskey
beer
and
wine
booze
is
gone
and
soon
we
make
tobacco
fall
in
line
and
then
we
tackle
the
planets
chorus
hurrah
hurrah
we
hurrah
hurrah
an
end
to
joy
we
sing
come
let
make
life
doleful
and
then
death
will
lose
its
sting
happiness
is
only
a
habit
we
abolish
every
fruit
attempting
to
ferment
we
will
alter
nature
laws
and
teach
her
to
repent
let
the
fatal
gooseberry
proceed
where
cocktails
went
and
then
we
tackle
the
planets
chorus
as
before
from
the
beginning
of
the
day
however
it
became
apparent
that
there
was
a
concerted
movement
under
way
to
heckle
the
as
the
gooseberry
anthem
came
to
an
end
a
number
of
men
were
observed
on
the
skyline
of
a
tall
building
with
flags
all
eyes
were
turned
aloft
and
much
speculation
ensued
among
the
waiting
thousands
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
signals
then
a
cry
of
anger
burst
from
one
of
the
section
leaders
who
was
acquainted
with
the
morse
code
the
flags
were
spelling
what
a
day
for
a
drink
all
down
the
boulevard
the
white
and
gold
banners
tossed
in
anger
to
those
above
the
mass
of
agitated
chuffs
looked
like
a
field
of
daisies
in
a
wind
shortly
afterward
the
familiar
buzz
of
airplane
motors
was
heard
and
three
machines
came
coasting
above
the
channel
of
the
boulevard
they
flew
low
and
it
was
easy
to
read
the
initials
painted
on
the
nether
surface
of
their
wings
over
the
front
ranks
of
the
parade
which
was
beginning
to
fall
in
line
they
executed
a
series
of
fantastic
twirls
then
as
though
at
a
concerted
signal
they
dropped
a
cloud
of
paper
slips
which
came
eddying
down
through
the
sunlight
the
chuffs
scrambled
for
them
wondering
a
sullen
murmur
rose
when
the
messages
were
read
they
ran
thus
to
make
gooseberry
wine
paste
this
in
your
hat
ten
quarts
of
gooseberries
thoroughly
crushed
over
these
five
quarts
of
water
are
flushed
twice
round
the
clock
let
the
fluid
remain
then
through
a
sieve
the
blithe
mixture
you
strain
adding
some
sugar
not
less
than
ten
pound
and
stirring
it
carefully
round
and
around
to
the
pulp
of
the
fruit

remains
in
the
sieve
a
gallon
of
pure
filtered
water
you
give
this
you
let
stand
for
a
dozen
of
hours
then
add
to
the
other
to
strengthen
its
powers
shut
up
the
whole
for
the
space
of
a
day
and
it
will
ferment
in
a
riotous
way
when
you
see
by
the
froth
that
the
fluid
grows
thicker
you
should
skim
it
with
glee
for
it
turning
to
liquor
while
it
ferments
please
continue
to

the

you
may
murmur

and
hide
it
from

the
were
still
muttering
furiously
over
this
daring
act
of
defiance
when
a
shrill
pealed
down
the
avenue
bishop
chuff
rode
out
into
the
middle
of
the
street
on
his
famous
charger
john
barleycorn
there
was
a
long
hush
then
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
gave
the
signal
one
hundred
bands
burst
into
the
somber
and
clanging
strains
of
the
face
on
the
floor
the
great
parade
had
begun
from
a
farther
up
the
street
dunraven
bleak
watched
them
come
he
had
taken
quimbleton
word
seriously
and
with
his
usual
enterprise
had
rented
a
roof
overlooking
the
boulevard
on
which
several
members
of
the
balloon
staff
were
prepared
to
deal
with
any
startling
events
that
might
occur
a
battery
of
telephones
had
been
installed
on
the
bleak
himself
sat
with
apparatus
clamped
to
his
head
like
an
operator
at
central
two
reporters
were
busy
with
paper
and
pencil
the
cartoonist
sat
on
the
cornice
with
legs
swinging
above
two
hundred
feet
of
space
sketching
the
prodigious
scene
the
young
lady
editor
of
the
woman
page
was
there
with
opera
glasses
noting
down
the
among
those
present
it
was
an
spectacle
between
sidewalks
jammed
with
silent
and
morose
citizens
the
passed
like
a
conquering
army
the
terrible
bishop
the
man
who
had
put
military
discipline
into
the
ranks
of
his
mighty
organization
rode
his
horse
as
the
kaiser
would
have
liked
to
ride
entering
paris
his
small
bitter
fanatical
face
wore
a
deeply
carved
sneer
his
great
black
beard
flapped
in
the
breeze
and
he
sang
as
he
rode
behind
him
came
huge
floats
depicting
in
startling
tableaux
the
hideous
menace
of
the
gooseberry
bands
blared
and
crashed
then
rank
on
rank
as
far
as
eye
could
see
followed
the
zealots
in
their
garments
of
white
each
one
it
was
noticed
carried
a
neat
knapsack
huge
tractors
rumbled
along
groaning
beneath
a
tonnage
of
tracts
which
were
shot
into
the
watching
crowd
by
pneumatic
guns
banners
whipped
and
fluttered
the
sound
of
shrill
chanting
vibrated
in
the
blazing
air
like
a
visible
wave
of
power
these
were
conquerors
of
a
nation
and
they
knew
it
a

standing
in
the
front
of
the
crowd
caught
merciless
gaze

and
swooned
a
retired

sitting
in
the
window
of
the
brass

fell
dead
of
apoplexy
bleak
trembled
with
nervousness
had
quimbleton
hoaxed
him
what
could
halt
this
mighty
pageant
now
he
was
about
to
telephone
to
his
city
editor
to
go
ahead
with
the
one
edition
as
originally
planned
from
the
sky
came
a
roar
of
engines
that
drowned
for
a
moment
the
thundering
echoes
of
the
parade
the
three
gray
planes
which
had
been
circling
far
above
swooped
down
almost
to
a
level
with
the
tops
of
the
buildings
one
of
these
a
huge
bomber
passed
directly
over
bleak
head
he
craned
upward
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
what
he
thought
at
first
was
a
white
pennant
trailing
over
the
bulwark
of
the
cockpit
a
snowy
shag
of
whiskers
came
tossing
down
through
the
air
and
fell
in
his
lap
it
was
quimbleton

torn
from
its
moorings
by
the
tug
of
bleak
thrust
it
quickly
in
his
pocket
as
the
great
plane
passed
over
the
head
of
the
parade
flying
dangerously
low
every
face
save
that
of
the
bishop
was
turned
upward
but
even
in
their
curiosity
the
rigid
discipline
of
the

were
singing
to

used

many
a
year
ago
the
great
volume
of
gusty
sound
hurled
aloft
by
these
thousands
of
mouths
created
an
in
which
the
bombing
plane
tilted
dangerously
for
a
moment
bleak
who
was
watching
the
plane
thought
it
was
going
to
careen
into
a
and
crash
down
fatally
then
he
saw
quimbleton
still
recognizable
by
an
adhering
shred
of
whisker
lean
over
the
side
of
the
fuselage
a
small
dark
object
dropped
through
the
air
fell
with
a
loud
pop
on
the
street
a
few
yards
in
front
of
the
bishop
a
faint
green
vapor
arose
misting
for
a
moment
the
proud
figures
of
chuff
and
his
horse
at
the
same
instant
the
other
two
planes
throbbing
down
the
line
of
the
parade
discharged
a
rain
of
similar
projectiles
along
the
vacant
strip
of
paving
between
the
marching
chuffs
and
the
curb
an
eddying
emerald
fume
filled
the
street
drifting
with
the
brisk
air
down
through
all
the
ranks
of
the
procession
there
were
shouts
and
screams
the
clanging
bands
squawked
discordantly

soused
oh
boy
some

look
at
the
bish
he
got
a
snootful
already
his
face
has
turned
black
the
whole
crowd
has
turned
black
said
the
cartoonist
almost
falling
off
his
perch
in
a
frantic
effort
to
see
more
clearly
through
the
olive
haze
that
filled
the
street
it
was
true
above
the
thousands
of
white
figures
as
they
emerged
from
the
intoxicating
of
gooseberry
gas
grinned
ghastly
inhuman
blackened
faces
with
staring
goggle
eyes
the
bishop
was
most
frightful
of
all
his
horse
was
prancing
and
swaying
wildly
and
the
bishop
transformed
features
were
diabolic
his
whole
profile
had
altered
seemed
black
and
shapeless
as
the
face
of
a
tadpole
the
amazing
truth
burst
upon
bleak
chuff
and
his
paraders
were
wearing
these
were
what
they
had
carried
in
their
knapsacks
indomitable
chuff
who
had
foreseen
everything
poor
quimbleton
said
bleak
this
will
break
his
heart
his
neck
too
i
fancy
said
one
of
the
others
pointing
to
the
sky
and
indeed
one
of
the
three
planes
was
seen
falling
tragically
to
earth
behind
the
tower
of
the
city
hall
the
cloud
of
gas
was
rapidly
drifting
off
down
the
boulevard
and
through
the
exhilarating
and
delicious
fog
the
waved
their
defiant
banners
unscathed
the
progress
of
the
parade
however
was
halted
by
the
behavior
of
the
bishop
horse
for
which
no
mask
had
been
provided
the
noble
animal
under
this
sudden
and
extraordinary
stimulus
was
almost
human
in
its
actions
at
first
it
stood
whinneying
sharply
and
pawing
the
air
with
one
forefoot
as
though
feeling
for
the
brass
rail
as
one
of
bleak
companions
said
it
raised
its
head
proudly
with
open
mouth
and
expanded
nostrils
then
dashing
off
across
the
broad
street
it
seemed
eager
to
climb
a
and
only
the
fierce
restraint
of
the
bishop
held
it
in
one
of
the
chuffs
perhaps
only
lukewarm
in
loyalty
ran
up
and
offered
to
give
his
mask
to
the
horse
but
was
sternly
motioned
back
to
the
ranks
by
the
infuriated
leader
who
was
wildly
wrestling
to
gain
control
of
the
exuberant
animal
at
last
the
horse
solved
the
problem
by
lying
down
in
the
street
on
top
of
the
bishop
and
going
to
sleep
an
ambulance
marked
federal
home
for
inebriates
cana
dashed
up
with
shrilling
gong
this
had
been
arranged
by
quimbleton
who
had
wired
a
requisition
for
an
ambulance
to
remove
one
intoxicated
bishop
as
the
bishop
was
quite
in
command
of
his
faculties
the
horse
after
some
delay
was
hoisted
into
the
ambulance
instead
the
bishop
was
given
a
dusting
and
the
parade
proceeded
the
of
the
police
alone
averted
prolonged
and
frightful
disorder
for
when
the
conduct
of
the
horse
was
observed
thousands
of
spectators
fought
desperately
to
get
through
the
ropes
and
out
into
the
fumes
that
still
lingered
in
wisps
and
whorls
of
green
vapor
others
tore
off
their
coats
and
attempted
to
bag
a
few
cubic
inches
of
the
gas
in
these
garments
but
the
police
with
a
devotion
to
duty
that
was
beyond
praise
kept
the
mob
in
check
and
themselves
bore
the
brunt
of
the
lingering
acid
only
one
man
who
leaped
from
an
with
an
improvised
parachute
really
succeeded
in
getting
into
the
middle
of
the
boulevard
and
he
refused
to
be
ejected
on
the
ground
that
he
was
chief
of
the
department
this
department
by
the
way
was
given
a
remarkable
illustration
of
the
fine
public
spirit
of
the
citizens
for
by
three
in
the
afternoon
two
hundred
thousand
applications
had
been
received
from
those
eager
to
act
as
volunteer
and
help
scour
the
boulevard
after
the
passage
of
the
great
parade
chapter
iv
the
great
war
begins
as
the
echoes
of
the
parade
died
away
public
excitement
was
roused
to
fever
by
the
discovery
that
evening
of
an
infernal
machine
in
the
city
hall
leaning
against
one
of
the
great
marble
pillars
in
the
lobby
of
the
building
a
gleaming
object
looking
very
much
like
a
shrapnel
shell
was
found
by
a
vigilant
patrolman
to
his
horror
he
found
it
to
be
one
of
the
thermos
bottles
experts
from
the
bureau
of
rumbustibles
were
summoned
and
the
bomb
was
carefully
analyzed
much
to
the
disappointment
of
the
chief
inspector
the
devilish
ingredients
of
the
explosive
had
been
spoiled
by
immersion
in
a
pail
of
water
so
his
examination
was
purely
theoretical
but
it
was
plain
that
the
leading
component
of
this
hellish
mixture
had
been
nothing
less
than
gin
animated
by
a
fuse
of
if
the
cylinder
had
exploded
unquestionably
every
occupant
of
the
city
hall
would
have
been
intoxicated
the
conduct
of
the
municipal
officials
in
this
crisis
was
extremely
courageous
no
one
knew
whether
other
articles
of
this
kind
might
not
be
concealed
about
the
building
but
the
mayor
and
councilmen
refused
to
go
home
and
even
assisted
in
the
search
for
possible
bombs
secret
service
men
were
called
from
washington
and
went
into
consultation
with
bishop
chuff
it
was
a
night
of
uproar
a
reign
of
terror
was
freely
predicted
and
many
prominent
citizens
sat
up
until
after
midnight
on
the
chance
of
discovering
similar
explosives
concealed
about
their
premises
the
morning
papers
rallied
rapidly
to
the
cause
of
threatened
civilization
the
daily
circumspect
declared
editorially
the
alcoholsheviks
have
at
last
thrown
down
the
gauntlet
the
news
that
the
ginarchists
have
placed
a
ginfernal
machine
in
the
very
shrine
of
law
and
order
is
tantamount
to
a
declaration
of
war
upon
sobriety
as
a
whole
a
canister
of
forbidden
design
filled
with
the
deadliest
gingredients
was
found
in
the
corridor
leading
to
the
bureau
of
marriage
licenses
in
the
city
hall
there
must
have
been
something
more
than
accident
in
its
discovery
just
in
this
spot
men
of
thoughtful
temper
will
do
well
to
heed
the
symbolism
of
this
incident
plainly
not
only
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
to
be
made
a
but
the
very
sanctity
of
the
marriage
bond
is
assailed
to
this
form
of
terrorism
there
is
but
one
answer
in
the
meantime
quimbleton
had
disappeared
the
house
on
caraway
street
was
broken
into
by
the
police
but
except
for
the
grape
arbor
and
a
great
quantity
of
empty
bottles
in
the
cellar
no
clue
was
found
apparently
however
the
vanished
ginarchist
for
so
chuff
called
him
had
been
writing
poetry
before
his
departure
the
following
rather
inscrutable
doggerel
was
found
scrawled
on
a
piece
of
paper
when
death
doth
reap
and
chuff
is
sickled
he
will
not
keep
he
was
never
pickled
for
bishop
chuff
this
is
ill
cheer
that
time
will
force
him
to
the
bier
and
when
he
stands
on
his
last
legs
then
death
will
drain
him
to
the
dregs
so
when
chuff
croaks
bury
him
on
a
high
hill
for
he
a
hoax
et
praeterea
nihil
but
bishop
chuff
was
not
the
man
to
take
these
insults
tamely
his
first
act
was
to
call
together
the
legislature
of
the
state
in
special
session
and
the
following
act
was
rushed
through
an
act
severing
relations
with
nature
and
amending
the
principles
and
processes
of
the
same
in
so
far
as
they
contravene
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
tenets
of
the
whereas
in
accordance
with
the
declaration
of
gindependence
it
may
become
necessary
for
a
people
to
dissolve
the
alcoholic
bands
which
have
connected
them
with
one
another
and
to
assume
among
the
powers
of
the
earth
the
sobriety
to
which
the
laws
of
pessimism
entitle
them
a
decent
disrespect
to
the
opinions
of
drinkers
requires
that
they
should
declare
the
causes
which
impel
them
to
drouth
whereas
we
hold
these
truths
to
be
that
all
men
are
created
sober
and
are
endowed
with
certain
inalienable
rights
such
as
life
grievances
and
the
pursuit
of
other
people
happiness
whenever
any
form
of
amusement
becomes
destructive
of
these
ends
it
is
the
right
of
the
to
abolish
it
prudence
indeed
will
dictate
that
beverages
long
established
should
not
be
abolished
for
light
and
transient
causes
but
when
it
is
evident
that
nature
herself
is
in
conspiracy
against
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
that
millions
of
human
beings
have
found
in
forbidden
tipples
a
cause
for
mirth
and
merriment
it
is
time
to
call
a
halt
to
malt
and
have
no
parley
with
barley
whereas
it
has
frequently
and
regrettably
been
evidenced
that
nature
is
a
sot
at
heart
by
reason
of
her
deplorably
lax
morals
painful
as
it
is
to
make
the
admission
there
are
many
of
her
apparently
innocent
fruits
and
plants
that
are
susceptible
by
the
unlawful
processes
of
fermentation
and
effervescence
of
transformation
into
alcoholic
liquid
science
tells
us
that
this
abominable
form
of
activity
to
which
nature
is
privy
is
in
reality
a
form
of
decomposition
or
putrefaction
but
willful
men
will
hardly
be
restrained
by
science
in
their
illicit
pursuit
of
frivolity
whereas
nature
hereinafter
referred
to
as
the
enemy
has
been
guilty
of
repeated
ruptures
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
having
permitted
the
juice
of
apples
to
ferment
into
cider
having
encouraged
seditious
effervescence
on
the
part
of
gooseberries
currants
raisins
grapes
and
similar
conspirators
having
fomented
outrageous
yeastiness
in
hops
malt
rye
barley
and
other
grains
and
fodders
therefore
be
it
enacted
and
it
hereby
is
that
all
relations
with
the
enemy
are
hereby
and
henceforward
suspended
and
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
having
commerce
with
nature
or
giving
her
aid
and
comfort

and
rendered
null
and

it
is
hoped
that
this
suspension
of
relations
with
nature
will
operate
as
a
sharp
rebuke
and
bring
her
to
reason
it
is
not
the
sense
of
this
act
to
withhold
from
the
enemy
all
hope
of
a
future
reconciliation
should
she
cast
off
the
habits
that
have
made
her
a
menace
we
have
no
quarrel
with
nature
as
a
whole
but
there
is
a
certain
misguided
clique
the
dandelions
and
gooseberries
and
other
irresponsible
plants
which
must
be
humiliated
we
do
not
presume
to
suggest
to
nature
any
alteration
or
modification
of
her
necessary
institutions
but
who
can
claim
that
the
principle
of
fermentation
which
she
has
arrogated
to
herself
is
necessary
to
her
health
and
happiness
this
intolerable
thing
of
which
nature
has
shown
us
the
ugly
mug
this
menace
of
combined
intrigue
and
force
must
be
crushed
with
proud
punctilio
and
for
the
strict
enforcement
of
this

this
document
having
been
signed
by
the
governor
became
law
and
thousands
of
people
who
were
about
to
leave
town
for
their
vacation
were
held
up
at
the
railway
stations
nature
was
declared
under
martial
law
there
were
many
who
held
that
the
act
while
admirable
in
principle
did
not
go
far
enough
in
practice
for
instance
it
was
argued
the
detestable
principle
of
fermentation
was
due
in
great
part
to
the
influence
of
the
sun
upon
vegetable
matter
and
it
was
suggested
that
this
heavenly
body
should
be
abolished
others
pointing
out
that
this
was
a
matter
that
would
take
some
time
advanced
the
theory
that
large
tracts
of
open
country
should
be
shielded
from
the
sun
rays
by
vast
tents
or
awnings
bishop
chuff
with
his
customary
perspicacity
made
it
plain
that
one
of
the
chief
causes
of
temptation
was
hot
weather
which
causes
immoderate
thirst
in
order
to
lessen
the
amount
of
thirst
in
the
population
he
suggested
that
it
might
be
feasible
to
shift
the
axis
of
the
earth
so
that
the
climate
of
the
united
states
would
become
perceptibly
cooler
and
the
torrid
zone
would
be
transferred
to
the
area
of
the
north
pole
this
would
have
the
supreme
advantage
of
melting
all
the
northern
and
providing
the
temperate
belts
with
a
new
supply
of
fresh
water
it
would
be
quite
easy
the
bishop
insisted
to
tilt
the
earth
on
its
axis
if
everything
heavy
on
the
surface
of
the
united
states
were
moved
up
to
bay

he
began
to

take
his

to
get
a
passport

go
into
the

the
pretext
of
observing
the
movements
of
the
troops
of
the
who
were
vigorously
attacking
the
dandelion
fields
and
gooseberry
vineyards
he
had
already
sent
his
wife
and
children
down
to
the
seashore
in
the
last
refugee
train
which
had
left
the
city
before
nature
was
declared
outlaw
it
was
a
hot
morning
and
having
wound
up
his
work
at
the
office
he
was
sitting
in
a
small
lunchroom
having
a
shrimp
salad
sandwich
and
a
glass
of
milk
the
street
outside
was
thronged
with
great
motor
ambulances
rumbling
in
from
the
suburbs
carrying
the
wilted
remains
of
berries
and
fruits
which
had
been
dug
up
by
the
furious
legions
of
chuff
these
were
hastily
transported
to
the
municipal
cannery
where
they
were
made
into
jams
and
preserves
with
all
possible
speed
before
fermentation
could
set
in
bleak
saw
them
pass
with
saddened
eyes
a
beautiful
gray
motor
car
drew
up
at
the
curb
and
honked
vigorously
the
proprietor
of
the
lunchroom
thinking
that
possibly
the
chauffeur
wanted
some
sandwiches
left
the
cash
register
and
crossed
the
pavement
eagerly
every
eye
in
the
restaurant
was
turned
upon
the
glittering
limousine
whose
panels
of
gray
shone
with
a
steely
lustre
in
a
moment
the
proprietor
returned
with
a
large
basket
and
a
small
folded
paper
looking
puzzled
he
glanced
about
the
room
and
approached
bleak
i
guess
you
the
guy
he
said
and
handed
the
editor
a
note
on
which
was
scrawled
in
pencil
to
the
man
with
a
penetrating
gaze
who
has
just
spilled
some
shrimp
salad
on
his
palm
beach
trousers
bleak
after
removing
the
shrimp
opened
the
paper
inside
he
read
please
bring
two
dozen

and
as
much
shrimp

as
the
basket
will
hold
am
famished
quimbleton
he
looked
at
the
restaurateur
in
surprise
the
lady
said
you
were
to
get
the
grub
and
put
it
in
this
basket
said
the
latter
the
lady
inquired
bleak
the

said
isidor

of
the
busy
wasp
lunchroom
bleak
obeyed
orders
he
filled
the
basket
with
tongue
sandwiches
and
a
huge
platter
of
shrimp
salad
paid
the
check
and
carried
the
burden
to
the
door
of
the
motor
at
the
wheel
sat
a
damsel
of
extraordinary
beauty
the
massive
proportions
of
the
enormous
car
only
accentuated
the
perfection
of
her
streamline
figure
her
chassis
was
admirable
she
was
upholstered
in
a
sports
suit
of
whipcord
and
her
eyes
were
unmodified
by
any
dimming
devices
before
bleak
could
say
anything
she
cried
eagerly
get
in
mr
bleak
i
been
looking
for
you
everywhere
what
a
happy
moment
this
is
bleak
handed
in
the
basket
quimbleton
he
began
i
know
she
said
i
taking
you
to
him
poor
fellow
he
is
in
great
peril
get
in
please
by
the
time
bleak
was
in
the
seat
beside
her
the
car
was
already
in
motion
you
have
your
passport
she
said
steering
through
the
tangled
traffic
yes
he
said
he
could
not
help
stealing
a
sidelong
glance
at
this
bewitching
creature
her
dainty
and
vivacious
face
just
now
a
trifle
sunburnt
was
fixed
resolutely
upon
the
vehicles
ahead
on
the
rim
of
the
big
steering
wheel
her
small
gloved
hands
gave
an
impression
of
great
capability
bleak
thought
that
her
profile
seemed
oddly
familiar
have
i
seen
you
before
he
said
very
possibly
your
newspaper
printed
my
picture
the
other
day
with
some
rather
uncomplimentary
remarks
bleak
was
nonplussed
very
stupid
of
me
he
said
but
i
do
seem
to
recall
i
am
miss
chuff
she
said
calmly
the
editor
brain
staggered
miss
theodolinda
chuff
he
said
in
amazement
he
recalled
some
satirical
editorials
the
balloon
had
printed
concerning
the
activities
of
the
chuffs
and
wondered
if
he
were
being
kidnaped
for
by
the
evidently
the
use
of
quimbleton
name
had
been
a
ruse
it
was
unfair
of
you
to
make
use
of
quimbleton
name
to
get
me
into
your
hands
he
said
angrily
miss
chuff
turned
a
momentary
gaze
of
amusement
upon
him
as
they
passed
a
large
tractor
drawing
several
truckloads
of
gooseberry
plants
you
do
understand
she
said
demurely
you
may
remember
that
quimbleton
card
gave
his
name
as
associate
director
of
the
happiness
corporation
yes
said
bleak
i
am
the
director
she
said
you
but
how
can
that
be
why
your
father
that
just
why
any
one
who
had
to
live
with
father
would
be
sure
to
take
the
opposite
side
he
a
i
a
those
poems
i
have
written
for
him
were
merely
a
form
of
camouflage
besides
they
were
so
absurd
they
were
sure
to
do
harm
to
the
cause
that
why
i
wrote
them
i
explain
it
all
to
you
a
little
later
at
this
moment
they
were
held
up
by
an
armed
guard
of
chuffs
stationed
at
the
city
limits
these
saluted
respectfully
on
seeing
the
daughter
but
examined
bleak
passport
with
care
then
the
car
passed
on
into
the
suburbs
as
they
neared
the
fields
of
actual
battle
bleak
was
able
to
see
something
of
the
embittered
nature
of
the
conflict
in
the
hot
white
sunlight
of
the
summer
morning
platoons
of
could
be
seen
marching
across
the
fields
going
up
from
the
rest
centers
to
the
firing
line
in
one
place
a
shallow
trench
had
been
dug
from
which
the
chuffs
were
firing
upon
a
blackberry
hedge
at
long
range
one
by
one
the
unprincipled
berries
were
being
picked
off
by
expert
marksmen
the
dusty
highway
was
stained
with
ghastly
rivulets
and
dribbles
of
scarlet
juices
at
a
crossroads
they
came
upon
a
group
of
chuffs
who
had
shown
themselves
to
be
conscientious
objectors
these
were
being
escorted
to
an
internment
camp
where
they
would
be
horribly
punished
by
confinement
to
lecture
rooms
with
chautauqua
lecturers
war
is
always
cruel
and
even
did
not
escape
in
the
heat
of
combat
the
neutrality
of
an
orchard
of
plum
trees
had
been
violated
and
wagonloads
of
the
innocent
fruit
were
being
carried
away
into
slavery
and
worse
than
death
a
young
apple
tree
was
standing
in
front
of
a
firing
squad
and
bleak
closed
his
eyes
rather
than
watch
the
tragic
spectacle
the
apples
were
all
green
and
too
young
to
ferment
but
the
chuffs
were
ruthless
once
their
passions
were
roused
they
passed
through
the
battle
zone
and
into
a
strip
of
country
where
pine
woods
flourished
on
a
sandy
soil
the
fragrant
breath
of
balsam
came
down
about
them
and
miss
chuff
let
out
the
motor
as
though
to
escape
from
the
scene
of
carnage
they
had
just
witnessed
whither
are
we
bound
asked
the
editor
with
pardonable
curiosity
as
their
tires
hummed
over
a
smooth
road
cana
new
jersey
said
miss
chuff
where
poor
quimbleton
is
in
hiding
he
is
in
very
sore
straits
he
narrowly
escaped
capture
after
the
parade
the
other
day
i
managed
to
get
him
smuggled
out
of
the
city
in
the
same
ambulance
that
carried
father
horse
the
horse
was
drunk
and
quim
was
sober
was
that
an
irony
of
fate
but
i
promised
to
tell
you
how
i
became

with
the

corporation
chapter
v
the
treachery
of
miss
chuff
my
story
said
miss
chuff
as
the
car
slid
along
the
road
is
rich
in
pathos
my
father
as
you
can
imagine
is
an
impossible
man
to
live
with
my
poor
mother
was
taken
to
an
asylum
years
ago
her
malady
takes
a
curious
form
she
is
never
violent
but
spends
all
her
time
in
poring
over
books
magazines
and
papers
every
time
she
finds
the
word
husband
in
print
she
crosses
it
out
with
blue
pencil
from
my
earliest
days
i
was
accustomed
to
hear
very
little
else
but
talk
about
liquor
the
fairy
tales
that
most
children
are
allowed
to
enjoy
merely
as
stories
were
explained
to
me
by
my
father
as
allegories
bearing
upon
the
sinister
seductions
of
drink
little
red
riding
hood
and
the
wolf
for
instance
became
a
symbol
of
young
womanhood
pursued
by
the
devouring
bronx
cocktail
the
princess
from
whose
mouth
came
toads
and
snakes
was
of
course
a
princess
under
the
influence
of
creme
de
menthe
cinderella
was
a
young
girl
who
had
been
brought
low
by
taking
a
dash
of
brandy
in
her
soup
every
dragon
with
which
good
fairy
tales
are
liberally
provided
was
the
demon
rum
it
is
really
amazing
what
stirring
prohibition
propaganda
fairy
tales
contain
if
you
know
how
to
interpret
them
all
this
kind
of
palaver
naturally
roused
my
childish
curiosity
as
to
the
subject
of
intoxicants
but
like
a
docile
daughter
i
fell
into
the
career
marked
out
for
me
by
my
father
i
became
a
militant
for
the
i
distributed
tracts
by
the
million
i
wrote
a
little
poem
on
the
idea
that
the
gates
of
hell
are
swinging
doors
with
slats
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
never
felt
any
real
hankering
for
liquor
until
it
was
prohibited
altogether
that
is
a
curious
feature
of
human
nature
that
as
soon
as
you
forbid
a
thing
it
becomes
irresistibly
alluring
you
remember
the
story
of
bluebeard
it
occurred
to
me
after
booze
had
gone
that
it
was
a
sad
thing
that
i
bishop
chuff
daughter
who
was
devoting
my
life
to
the
prohibition
cause
should
have
not
the
slightest
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
this
hideous
evil
we
had
been
pursuing
i
brooded
over
this
a
great
deal
and
fell
into
a
melancholy
state
the
thought
came
to
me
there
must
be
some
virtue
in
drink
or
why
would
so
many
people
have
stubbornly
contested
its
abolition
it
would
be
too
long
a
story
to
tell
you
all
the
details
but
it
was
at
that
time
that
i
first
became
aware
of
my
psychic
gift
your
psychic
gift
queried
bleak
wondering
she
turned
her
bright
eyes
upon
him
gravely
yes
she
said
i
am
an
alcoholic
medium
it
is
the
latest
and
most
superior
form
of
spiritualism
by
gazing
upon
crystal
particularly
upon
an
empty
tumbler
i
am
able
to
throw
myself
into
a
trance
in
which
i
can
communicate
with
departed
spirits
a
good
drink
does
not
die
you
know
its
soul
hovers
radiantly
on
the
twentieth
plane
and
through
the
occult
power
of
a
medium
those
who
loved
it
in
life
can
get
in
touch
with
it
once
more
through
these
trances
of
mine
i
have
been
privileged
to
put
many
bereaved
ones
in
communication
with
their
dear
departed
spirits
to
hear
the
and
the
shouts
of
ecstasy
you
would
perceive
that
a
great
deal
of
the
anguish
of
separation
is
assuaged
do
you
often
have
these
trances
said
bleak
with
a
certain
wistfulness
they
are
not
hard
to
induce
she
said
all
that
is
necessary
for
a
seance
is
a
round
table
preferably
of
some
highly
polished
brown
wood
a
brass
rail
for
the
worshipers
to
put
their
feet
on
and
an
empty
tumbler
to
concentrate
the
power
of
yearning
if
those
present
all
wish
hard
enough
there
is
sure
to
be
a
successful
reunion
with
the
beyond
but
surely
said
the
fascinated
editor
surely
not
any
well
actual
materialization
oh
no
but
the
communion
of
souls
produces
quite
sufficient
results
you
see
so
many
fine
spirits
passed
over
at
once
suddenly
on
that
first
of
july
that
the
twentieth
plane
is
quite
thronged
with
them
and
they
are
just
as
eager
to
come
back
as
their
friends
could
be
to
welcome
them
one
good
yearn
deserves
another
as
we
say
the
only
time
when
these
seances
fail
is
when
some
inharmonious
soul
is
present
some
personality
not
completely
en
rapport
with
the
spirit
of
the
gathering
i
remember
for
instance
an
occasion
when
a
gentleman
from
kentucky
had
most
ardently
desired
to
get
into
communication
with
the
astrals
of
some
mint
juleps
he
had
loved
very
deeply
in
life
everything
seemed
propitious
but
though
i
struggled
hard
i
simply
could
not
get
the
julep
spirit
to
descend
to
our
mortal
plane
finally
i
made
inquiry
and
found
that
one
of
the
guests
was
a
manufacturer
of
course
you
may
say
that
was
petty
jealousy
on
the
side
of
the
departed
but
even
these
vanished
spirits
have
their
human
phases
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
you
can
imagine
she
said
what
a
perplexity
i
was
in
when
i
discovered
these
hitherto
unsuspected
powers
in
myself
was
i
justified
in
putting
them
to
use
for
the
good
of
humanity
and
was
there
a
certain
pathetic
significance
in
the
fact
that
i
the
daughter
of
the
man
who
had
done
so
much
to
put
these
poor
lonely
spirits
into
the
beyond
should
be
made
their
sole
channel
of
reunion
with
their
bereaved
and
sorrowing
adorers
in
all
his
harangues
i
had
never
heard
my
father
attack
anything
but
the
actual
drinking
of
liquor
this
form
of
communication
seemed
to
me
to
solve
so
many
problems
and
it
was
in
this
way
that
i
first
met
virgil
virgil
said
bleak
for
he
was
wondering
whether
he
might
be
privileged
to
attend
one
of
these
seances
virgil
quimbleton
she
said
in
the
early
days
of
my
trances
i
was
much
haunted
by
the
spirit
of
a
certain
cocktail
blended
i
believe
of
champagne
and
angostura
which
insisted
that
it
would
be
inconsolable
until
it
could
get
in
contact
with
quimbleton
and
reassure
him
as
to
the
certainty
of
its
existence
beyond
mortal
bars
the
deep
affection
and
old
comradeship
evidently
cherished
between
quimbleton
and
this
cocktail
was
very
touching
and
i
was
more
than
happy
to
be
able
to
effect
their
reunion
it
was
for
this
reason
that
quimbleton
under
a
careful
disguise
came
to
live
next
door
to
us
on
caraway
street
i
would
go
out
into
the
garden
and
have
a
trance
quimbleton
poor
bereaved
fellow
would
sit
by
me
in
the
dusk
and
revel
with
the
spirit
of
his
dear
comrade
this
common
bond
soon
ripened
into
jove
and
we
became
betrothed
she
stripped
off
one
of
her
gloves
and
showed
bleak
a
beautiful
amethyst
ring
this
is
my
engagement
ring
she
said
it
a
very
precious
symbol
for
quimbleton
explained
to
me
that
the
amethyst
is
a
talisman
against
drunkenness
i
looked
it
up
in
the
dictionary
and
found
that
he
was
right
as
long
as
i
wear
this
ring
the
departed
spirits
have
no
ill
effect
upon
me
but
i
sometimes
wonder
she
added
with
a
sigh
whether
virgil
really
loves
me
for
myself
or
only
as
a
kind
of
swinging
door
into
the
spirit
world
the
car
was
now
approaching
an
open
belt
of
country
behind
them
lay
the
dark
line
of
pine
woods
far
off
across
a
wide
shimmer
of
sun
and
sandy
fields
sweetened
by
purple
clover
and
flowering
grasses
was
a
blue
ribbon
of
sea
but
even
in
this
remote
shelf
of
new
jersey
the
implacable
hand
of
chuff
was
at
work
from
a
meadow
near
by
they
saw
an
observation
balloon
going
up
and
the
windlass
unwinding
its
cable
a
huge
paraboloid
or
breathoscope
was
stationed
on
a
low
ridge
this
terribly
ingenious
machine
which
had
just
been
invented
by
the
records
the
vibrations
of
any
alcoholic
breath
within
five
miles
and
indicates
on
a
sensitive
dial
the
exact
direction
and
distance
of
the
breath
it
was
only
too
evident
that
the
search
for
quimbleton
was
going
forward
with
fierce
system
in
the
shelter
of
an
old
barn
they
heard
a
going
off
rapidly
this
was
one
of
the
most
atrocious
ruses
employed
by
the
chuffs
in
their
search
for
conscientious
drinkers
the
gun
fires
no
projectile
but
produces
a
pleasant
detonation
like
the
swift
and
repeated
drawing
of
corks
set
up
in
the
neighborhood
of
any
man
it
will
invariably
lure
him
into
an
approach
near
it
was
an
device
used
for
the
same
purposes
of
stratagem
poor
virgil
said
miss
chuff
with
a
sigh
i
afraid
he
has
had
a
grievous
ordeal
we
must
run
carefully
now
so
as
not
to
give
him
away
fortunately
miss
chuff
presence
at
the
wheel
and
bleak
credentials
as
war
correspondent
enabled
them
to
pass
several
scouting
parties
of
chuff
uhlans
without
suspicion
in
this
way
they
neared
the
extensive
grounds
surrounding
the
federal
home
for
inebriates
cana
j
this
magnificent
gothic
building
already
showing
some
signs
of
decay
from
two
years
of
vacancy
stands
on
a
slight
eminence
among
what
the
real
estate
agents
call
old
shade
with
a
fine
and
carefully
calculated
view
over
one
of
the
largest
bodies
of
undrinkable
fluid
known
to
man
the
atlantic
ocean
the
car
turned
into
a
narrow
sandy
road
skirting
one
side
of
the
walled
park
this
byway
was
completely
screened
from
outside
observation
by
the
high
bulwark
of
the
home
and
by
thick
masses
of
rhododendron
shrubbery
at
a
bend
in
the
road
miss
chuff
halted
the
motor
and
motioned
bleak
to
descend
now
we
will
look
for
the
persecuted
patriot
she
said
bleak
took
charge
of
the
basket
of
food
and
miss
chuff
drew
a
small
rope
ladder
from
a
locker
under
the
driver
seat
this
she
threw
deftly
up
to
the
top
of
the
wall
hooking
it
upon
the
iron
spikes
bleak
politely
ascended
first
and
they
scaled
the
wall
dropping
down
into
a
tangle
of
underbrush
i
left
him
in
here
somewhere
said
the
girl
as
they
set
off
along
a
narrow
path
this
was
obviously
the
best
place
to
hide
as
except
for
father
horse
the
home
has
had
an
inmate
for
two
years
there
was
some
talk
of
father
making
this
the
headquarters
of
the
great
general
strafe
in
this
campaign
but
i
do
believe
they
have
done
so
yet
hush
said
bleak
what
is
that
i
hear
a
dull
regular
recurrent
sound
a
sort
of
rasping
sigh
stole
through
the
thickets
they
both
listened
in
some
agitation
sounds
a
little
like
an
airplane
with
one
engine
missing
said
bleak
can
it
be
the
sea
the
surf
breaking
on
the
sand
asked
miss
chuff
this
seemed
probable
and
they
accepted
it
as
such
but
as
they
pushed
on
through
the
tangle
of
saplings
and
bushes
the
sound
seemed
to
localize
itself
on
their
left
bleak
peeped
cautiously
through
a
leafy
screen
and
then
beckoned
the
girl
to
his
side
they
looked
down
into
a
warm
sandy
hollow
overgrown
and
sheltered
by
a
large
rhododendron
with
knotted
branches
and
dry
shiny
leaves
curled
up
on
the
sand
bank
in
the
unconsciously
pathetic
posture
of
sheer
exhaustion
lay
quimbleton
asleep
a
droning
snore
buzzed
heavily
from
where
he
lay
poor
virgil
said
miss
chuff
how
tired
he
looks
he
did
indeed
the
gray
and
silver
uniform
was
ragged
and
his
boots
were
white
with
dust
his
face
was
unshaved
though
a
razor
lay
beside
him
and
it
seemed
that
he
had
been
trying
to
strop
it
on
his
sam
browne
belt
his
pipe
filled
but
unlit
had
fallen
from
his
weary
fingers
beside
him
was
an
empty
and
tragic
evidence
of
a
number
of
unsuccessful
attempts
to
get
fire
from
a
swedish
tandsticker
crumpled
under
the
elbow
of
the
indomitable
idealist
was
a
copy
of
the
bartender
benefactor
or
how
to
mix
drinks
in
which
he
had
been
seeking
imaginary
solace
when
he
fell
asleep
near
his
head
ticked
a
pocket
alarm
clock
which
they
found
set
to
gong
at
two
it
seems
a
shame
to
wake
him
said
theodolinda
her
brown
eyes
liquefied
and
effervesced
with
tenderness
until
as
bleak
thought
to
himself
they
were
quite
the
color
of
brandy
and
soda
without
too
much
soda
the
sleeper
stirred
and
a
radiant
smile
passed
over
his
unconscious
features
a
smile
of
pure
and
heavenly
beatitude
say
when
jerry
he
murmured
he
dreaming
cried
theodolinda
see
his
soul
is
far
away
two
years
away
said
bleak
enviously
let
him
go
to
it
while
we
reconnoiter
i
believe
in
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
sleep
he
intend
to
wake
up
just
yet
you
can
see
by
the
alarm
clock
that
a
good
idea
she
agreed
i
like
to
find
out
whether
in
any
immediate
danger
of
pursuit
they
set
the
basket
of
food
beside
quimbleton
and
carefully
moved
on
through
the
strip
of
young
trees
until
they
neared
the
broad
lawns
that
surround
the
home
for
inebriates
miss
chuff
spying
delicately
through
a
leafy
chink
gave
a
cry
of
alarm
heavens
she
said
the
place
is
full
of
people
to
their
amazement
they
saw
the
white
banner
of
the
floating
on
one
of
the
towers
of
the
building
and
the
grounds
about
the
home
blackened
with
a
moving
throng
though
they
were
too
far
distant
to
discern
any
details
of
the
crowd
it
was
plain
from
the
curious
of
the
gathering
like
the
seething
of
an
that
its
units
were
imbued
with
some
strong
emotion
at
that
distance
it
might
have
been
anger
or
fear
or
more
appropriate
to
the
surroundings
drink
they
hurried
back
to
quimbleton
hiding
place
and
found
him
already
sitting
up
and
attacking
the
shrimp
salad
bleak
courteously
averted
his
eyes
from
the
affectionate
embrace
of
the
lovers
bless
your
heart
for
this
grub
said
quimbleton
to
bleak
as
soon
as
i
smelt
that
shrimp
salad
i
woke
up
do
you
know
i
have
eaten
for
two
days
oh
virgil
cried
theodolinda
what
does
this
mean
all
the
crowd
round
the
home
mr
bleak
and
i
looked
up
there
and
the
place
is
simply
packed
you
ca
stay
undiscovered
long
with
all
those
people
around
who
are
they
anyway
quimbleton
had
to
delay
his
reply
until
deglutition
had
mastered
a
bulky
consignment
of
shrimp
his
large
resolute
face
while
somewhat
marred
by
hardships
showed
no
trace
of
panic
i
know
all
about
it
he
said
it
is
the
latest
step
on
the
route
of
all
evil
taken
by
that
fanatical
person
whom
i
shall
presently
call
he
is
not
content
with
arresting
people
found
drinking
this
morning
they
began
to
seize
people
who
think
about
drinking
any
one
who
is
guilty
of
thinking
in
an
affirmative
way
about
liquor
is
to
be
interned
in
the
federal
home
for
a
course
in
mental
healing
but
how
can
they
tell
asked
bleak
nervously
i
do
know
said
quimbleton
perhaps
they
have
a
kind
of
third
degree
flash
a
seidel
of
beer
on
you
suddenly
and
if
you
make
an
involuntary
gesture
of
pleasure
you
convicted
perhaps
invented
an
instrument
that
tells
what
you
think
about
perhaps
they
just
arrest
you
on
suspicion
at
any
rate
all
the
folks
who
have
been
thinking
about
booze
are
being
collected
and
sent
over
here
i
know
because
i
seen
most
of
my
friends
arriving
all
morning
i
suppose
they
get
me
next
i
do
much
care
as
long
as
i
had
something
to
eat
virgil
dear
said
miss
chuff
you
must
give
up
hope
now
after
being
so
brave
you
know
i
stand
by
you
to
the
end
to
the
very
dregs
if
only
i
had
some
disguise
said
quimbleton
sadly
it
would
be
so
bad
but
i
must
confess
that
these
breath
detectors
and
other
unscrupulous
instruments
they
use
have
rather
unnerved
me
bleak
suddenly
remembered
and
thrust
his
hand
in
his
he
pulled
out
the
hank
of
white
beard
that
had
floated
down
from
the
airplane
a
few
days
before
it
was
much
crumpled
but
intact
good
man
cried
quimbleton
my
jolly
old
beard
he
clapped
it
onto
his
face
and
beamed
hopefully
now
if
there
were
some
way
of
getting
rid
of
this
uniform
they
discussed
this
problem
at
some
length
sitting
in
the
sheltered
bowl
of
sand
while
quimbleton
finished
his
lunch
bleak
suggestion
of
stitching
together
a
sort
of
robinson
crusoe
suit
of
rhododendron
leaves
did
not
meet
quimbleton
approval
no
robinson
trousseau
for
me
he
said
i
thought
of
pasting
together
the
leaves
of
the
bartender
benefactor
but
i
afraid
that
would
be
rather
damning
no
i
do
see
what
to
do
i
have
it
said
theodolinda
gleefully
i
got
a
sewing
kit
in
the
car
we
unrip
the
upholstery
and
i
can
stitch
you
up
a
suit
in
no
time
at
least
it
will
be
better
than
the
which
would
take
you
in
front
of
a
firing
squad
if
it
were
seen
this
seemed
a
good
idea
bleak
volunteered
to
escort
miss
chuff
back
to
the
car
and
help
her
rip
the
covers
off
the
cushions
this
was
done
and
they
carried
back
to
quimbleton
hiding
place
many
yards
of
pale
lilac
colored
twill
or
whatever
it
is
and
a
flask
of
iced
tea
in
spite
of
distant
sounds
of
warfare
the
time
passed
pleasantly
enough
miss
chuff
cut
out
and
stitched
assiduously
quimbleton
and
bleak
under
her
directions
sewed
on
the
buttons
snipped
from
the
uniform
birds
twittered
in
the
greenery
about
them
and
they
all
felt
something
of
the
elation
of
a
picnic
when
the
garments
were
done
and
quimbleton
retired
to
a
neighboring
copse
to
make
the
change
the
other
two
were
too
seriously
concerned
for
his
welfare
to
laugh
when
they
saw
him
splendid
cried
bleak
now
you
can
lie
down
in
miss
chuff
car
and
if
any
one
looks
in
they
just
think
you
part
of
the
furnishings
and
i
think
we
better
get
back
to
the
car
without
delay
said
theodolinda
i
like
to
get
you
out
of
this
danger
zone
as
soon
as
possible
they
hastened
back
to
the
wall
scaled
it
with
the
rope
ladder
and
stared
in
dismay
the
car
had
gone
they
could
see
it
far
down
the
road
guarded
by
a
group
of
a
cordon
of
the
enemy
had
been
thrown
completely
round
the
home
and
escape
was
impossible
worse
still
the
treachery
of
miss
chuff
must
have
been
discovered
and
they
trembled
to
think
what
retaliation
the
bishop
might
devise
in
this
moment
of
crisis
quimbleton
regained
his
customary
hardihood
quilted
in
his
lilac
garments
with
the
white
hedge
of
beard
tossing
in
the
breeze
he
looked
the
dashing
leader
there
only
one
thing
to
do
he
said
we
surrounded
in
this
place
we
must
go
to
the
home
make
common
cause
with
the
prisoners
there
and
lead
them
in
a
sudden
sally
of
escape
chapter
vi
departed
spirits
if
bishop
chuff
desired
to
make
people
stop
thinking
about
alcohol
his
plan
of
seizing
them
and
shutting
them
up
in
the
grounds
of
the
federal
home
at
cana
was
a
quaint
way
of
attaining
this
purpose
for
all
the
victims
who
had
been
suddenly
arrested
in
the
course
of
their
daily
concerns
accused
before
a
court
martial
of
harboring
illicit
alcoholic
desires
and
driven
over
to
cana
in
crowded
now
had
very
little
else
to
brood
about
in
the
golden
light
and
fragrance
of
a
summer
afternoon
here
they
were
surrounded
by
all
the
apparatus
to
restrain
alcoholic
excess
and
not
even
the
slightest
exhilaration
of
spirit
to
justify
the
depressing
scene
it
was
annoying
to
see
frequent
notices
such
as
this
entrance
for
or
vodka
patients
in
this
ward
or
inmates
must
not
bite
off
the
it
seemed
carrying
a
jest
too
far
when
these
citizens
most
of
whom
had
not
even
smelt
a
drink
in
two
years
found
themselves
billeted
into
padded
cells
and
confronted
by
rows
of
moreover
the
home
had
lain
unused
for
many
months
it
was
dusty
dilapidated
and
of
a
moldy
savor
some
of
the
unwilling
visitors
finding
that
the
grounds
included
a
strip
of
sandy
beach
took
their
ordeal
with
reasonable
philosophy
since
we
are
to
be
slaves
they
said
at
least
let
have
some
serf
bathing
and
donning
with
a
shudder
the
rather
gruesome
padded
bathing
suits
they
found
in
the
lockers
they
went
off
for
a
swim
others
of
a
humorous
turn
derived
a
certain
rudimentary
amusement
in
studying
the
garden
marked
reserved
for
patients
with
insane
delusions
where
they
found
a
very
excellent
of
the
battleground
of
the
marne
laid
out
by
a
former
inmate
who
had
imagined
himself
to
be
general
joffre
but
most
of
them
stood
about
in
groups
talking
bitterly
quimbleton
therefore
found
a
receptive
audience
for
his
spartacus
scheme
of
organizing
this
band
of
downtrodden
victims
into
a
fighting
force
he
gathered
them
into
the
of
the
home
and
addressed
them
in
spirited
language
my
friends
he
said
unaccustomed
as
i
am
to
public
speaking
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
administer
a
few
remarks
on
the
subject
of
our
present
situation
and
the
first
thought
that
comes
to
my
mind
candidly
is
this
that
we
must
give
bishop
chuff
credit
for
a
quality
we
never
imagined
him
to
possess
that
quality
gentlemen
is
a
sense
of
humor
i
hear
some
dissent
and
yet
it
seems
to
me
to
be
somewhat
humorous
that
this
gathering
composed
of
men
who
were
accustomed
in
the
good
old
days
to
carry
their
liquor
like
gentlemen
should
now
when
they
have
been
cold
sober
for
two
years
be
incarcerated
in
this
humiliating
place
surrounded
by
the
morbid
relics
of
those
weaker
souls
who
found
their
grog
too
strong
for
them
i
say
therefore
that
we
must
give
bishop
chuff
credit
for
a
sense
of
humor
it
makes
him
all
the
more
deadly
enemy
yet
i
think
we
will
have
the
laugh
on
him
yet
in
a
manner
i
shall
presently
describe
for
the
bishop
has
what
may
be
denominated
a
mind
he
undoubtedly
imagines
that
we
will
submit
tamely
to
this
outrage
he
has
surrounded
us
with
guards
he
expects
us
to
be
meek
in
my
experience
the
meek
inherit
the
dearth
let
us
not
be
meek
there
was
a
shout
of
applause
and
quimbleton
salient
of
beard
waved
triumphantly
as
he
gathered
strength
his
burly
figure
in
the
lilac
upholstering
dominated
the
audience
he
went
on
and
what
is
our
crime
that
we
have
nourished
in
the
privacy
of
our
own
intellects
treasonable
thoughts
or
desires
concerning
alcohol
gentlemen
it
is
the
first
principle
of
common
law
that
a
man
can
not
be
indicted
for
thinking
a
crime
there
must
be
some
overt
act
some
evidence
of
illegal
intention
can
a
man
be
deprived
of
freedom
for
carrying
concealed
thoughts
if
so
we
might
as
well
abolish
the
human
mind
itself
which
bishop
chuff
and
his
flunkeys
would
gladly
do
i
doubt
not
for
they
themselves
would
lose
nothing
thereby
vigorous
clapping
greeted
this
sally
now
gentlemen
cried
quimbleton
though
we
follow
a
lost
cause
and
even
though
the
gooseberry
and
the
raisin
and
the
apple
be
doomed
let
us
see
it
through
with
gallantry
the
enemy
has
mobilized
dreadful
engines
of
war
against
us
let
us
retort
in
kind
he
has
tanks
in
the
field
let
us
retort
with
tankards
they
tell
me
there
is
a
warship
in
the
offing
to
shell
us
into
submission
very
well
if
he
has
gobs
let
us
retort
with
goblets
if
he
has
deacons
let
us
parry
him
with
decanters
chuff
has
put
us
here
under
the
pretext
of
being
drunk
very
well
then
let
us
be
drunk
let
us
go
down
in
our
cups
not
in
our
saucers
where
there
a
swill
there
a
way
let
us
be
sot
in
our
ways
he
added
sotto
voce
terrific
uproar
followed
this
fine
outburst
quimbleton
had
to
calm
the
frenzy
by
gesturing
for
silence
i
hear
some
natural
queries
he
said
some
one
asks
to
this
i
shall
presently
explain
how
bear
with
me
a
moment
my
friends
it
would
be
idle
for
us
to
attempt
the
great
task
before
us
relying
merely
on
ourselves
in
such
great
crises
it
is
necessary
to
call
upon
a
higher
power
for
strength
and
succor
this
is
no
mere
brawl
no
haphazard
scuffle
it
is
the
if
i
were
jocosely
minded
i
might
say
it
is
the
of
a
great
principle
if
gentlemen
i
wished
to
harrow
your
souls
i
would
ask
you
to
hark
back
in
memory
to
the
fine
old
days
when
brave
men
and
lovely
women
sat
down
at
the
same
table
with
a
glass
of
wine
or
a
mug
of
ale
and
no
one
thought
any
the
worse
i
would
ask
you
to
remember
the
color
of
the
wine
in
the
goblet
how
it
caught
the
light
how
merrily
it
twinkled
with
beaded
bubbles
winking
at
the
brim
as
some
poet
has
observed
if
i
wanted
to
harrow
you
gentlemen
i
would
recall
to
you
little
tables
little
round
tables
set
out
under
the
trees
on
the
lawn
of
some
country
inn
where
the
enchanting
music
of
harp
and
fiddle
twangled
on
the
summer
air
where
great
bowls
of
punch
chimed
gently
as
the
lumps
of
ice
knocked
on
the
thin
crystal
the
little
tables
were
spread
tinder
the
trees
and
then
later
on
perhaps
the
customers
were
spread
under
the
i
would
ask
you
to
recall
the
manly
seidel
of
dark
beer
as
you
knew
it
the
bitter
chill
of
it
as
it
went
down
the
simple
felicity
it
induced
in
the
mind
i
could
quote
to
you
poet
after
poet
who
has
nourished
his
song
upon
honest
malt
liquor
i
need
only
think
of
masefield
who
has
put
these
manly
words
in
the
mouth
of
his
pirate
mate
oh
some
are
fond
of
spanish
wine
and
some
are
fond
of
french
and
some
swallow
tea
and
stuff
fit
only
for
a
wench
but
i
for
right
jamaica
till
i
roll
beneath
the
bench
oh
some
are
fond
of
fiddles
and
a
song
well
sung
and
some
are
all
for
music
for
to
lilt
upon
the
tongue
but
mouths
were
made
for
tankards
and
for
sucking
at
the
bung
this
apparently
artless
oratory
was
beginning
to
have
its
effect
loud
huzzas
filled
the
hall
these
touching
words
had
evoked
wistful
memories
hidden
deep
in
every
heart
old
wounds
were
reopened
and
bled
afresh
again
quimbleton
had
to
call
for
silence
i
will
recite
to
you
he
said
a
ditty
that
i
have
composed
myself
it
is
called
a
chanty
of
departed
spirits
in
a
voice
tremulous
with
emotion
he
began
the
earth
is
grown
puny
and
pallid
the
earth
is
grown
gouty
and
gray
for
whiskey
no
longer
is
valid
and
wine
has
been
voted
away
as
for
beer
we
no
longer
will
swill
it
in
riotous
rollicking
spree
the
little
hot
dogs
in
the
skillet
will
have
to
be
sluiced
down
with
tea
o
ales
that
were
creamy
like
lather
o
beers
that
were
foamy
like
suds
o
fizz
that
i
loved
like
a
father
o
fie
on
the
drinks
that
are
duds
i
sat
by
the
doors
that
were
slatted
and
the
stuff
had
a
surf
like
the
sea
no
vintage
was
anywhere
vatted
too
strong
for
ventripotent
me
i
wallowed
in
waves
that
were
tidal
but
yet
i
was
never
unmoored
and
after
the
twentieth
seidel
my
syllables
still
were
assured
i
never
was
forced
to
cut
cable
and
drift
upon
perilous
shores
to
get
home
i
was
perfectly
able
erect
or
at
least
on
all
fours
although
i
was
often
some
swiller
i
never
was
fuddled
or
blowsed
my
hand
was
still
firm
on
the
tiller
no
matter
how
deep
i
caroused
but
now
they
have
put
an
embargo
on
that
tingles
the
spine
we
ca
even
cozen
a
cargo
of
harmless
old
gooseberry
wine
but
no
legislation
can
daunt
us
the
drinks
that
we
knew
never
die
their
spirits
will
come
back
to
haunt
us
and
whimper
and
hover
near
by
the
spookists
insist
that
communion
exists
with
the
souls
that
we
lose
and
so
we
may
count
on
reunion
with
all
that
immortal
of
booze
those
spirits
we
loved
have
departed
to
some
psychical
twentieth
plane
but
still
we
will
not
be
downhearted
we
soon
greet
our
loved
ones
again
to
lighten
our
drouth
and
our
tedium
whenever
our
moments
would
sag
we
call
in
a
spiritist
medium
and
go
on
a
psychical
jag
as
the
frenzy
of
cheering
died
away
quimbleton
face
took
on
the
glow
of
simple
benignance
that
bleak
had
first
observed
at
the
time
of
the
julep
incident
in
the
balloon
office
the
flush
of
a
warm
impulsive
idealism
his
genial
features
it
was
the
face
of
one
who
deeply
loved
his
my
friends
he
said
now
i
am
able
to
say
in
all
sincerity
how
i
have
great
honor
in
presenting
to
you
my
betrothed
fiancee
miss
theodolinda
chuff
do
not
be
startled
by
the
name
gentlemen
miss
chuff
the
daughter
of
our
is
wholly
in
sympathy
with
us
she
is
the
possessor
happily
for
us
of
extraordinary
psychic
powers
i
have
persuaded
her
to
demonstrate
them
for
our
benefit
if
you
will
follow
my
instructions
implicitly
you
will
have
the
good
fortune
of
witnessing
an
alcoholic
seance
miss
chuff
very
pale
but
obviously
glad
to
put
her
spiritual
gift
at
the
disposal
of
her
lover
was
escorted
to
the
platform
by
bleak
the
editor
had
been
coached
beforehand
by
quimbleton
as
to
the
routine
of
the
seance
the
first
requirement
said
quimbleton
to
the
gathering
is
to
put
yourselves
in
the
proper
frame
of
mind
for
that
purpose
i
will
ask
you
all
to
stand
up
placing
one
foot
on
the
rung
of
a
chair
kindly
imagine
yourselves
standing
with
one
foot
on
a
brass
rail
you
will
then
summon
to
mind
with
all
possible
accuracy
and
vividness
the
scenes
of
some
which
was
once
dear
to
you
i
will
also
ask
you
to
concentrate
your
mental
faculties
upon
some
beverage
which
was
once
your
favorite
please
rehearse
in
imagination
the
entire
ritual
which
was
once
so
familiar
from
the
inquiring
look
of
the
bartender
down
to
the
final
clang
of
the
a
visualization
of
the
old
free
lunch
counter
is
also
advisable
all
these
details
will
assist
the
medium
to
trance
herself
bleak
in
the
meantime
had
carried
a
small
table
on
the
platform
and
placed
an
empty
glass
upon
it
miss
chuff
sat
down
at
this
table
and
gazed
intently
at
the
glass
quimbleton
produced
a
white
apron
from
somewhere
and
tied
it
round
his
burly
form
with
bleak
playing
the
role
of
customer
he
then
went
through
a
pantomime
of
serving
imaginary
drinks
his
representation
of
the
now
vanished
type
of
the
bartender
was
so
admirably
realistic
that
it
brought
tears
to
the
eyes
of
more
than
one
in
the
gathering
the
editor
with
appropriate
countenance
and
gesture
dramatized
the
motions
of
ordering
drinking
and
paying
for
his
invisible
refreshment
his
pantomime
was
also
accurate
and
satisfying
evidently
based
upon
seasoned
experience
the
argument
as
to
who
should
pay
the
gesture
conveying
the
generous
sentiment
this
one
on
me
the
spinning
of
a
coin
on
the
bar
the
raising
of
the
elbow
the
final
toss
that
dispatched
the
fluid
all
these
were
done
to
the
life
the
audience
followed
suit
with
a
will
a
whispering
rustle
ran
through
the
dingy
hall
as
each
man
murmured
his
favorite
catchwords
give
it
a
name
set
up
again
here
luck
and
such
archaic
phrases
were
faintly
audible
miss
chuff
kept
her
gaze
fastened
on
the
empty
tumbler
suddenly
her
rigid
pose
relaxed
she
drooped
forward
in
her
chair
with
her
head
sunk
and
hands
limp
tenderly
and
reverently
quimbleton
bent
over
her
then
his
face
shining
with
triumph
he
spoke
to
the
hushed
watchers
she
is
in
the
trance
he
said
gentlemen
her
happy
soul
is
in
touch
with
the
departed
spirits
what
you
have
do
all
speak
at
once
in
hushed
voices
petitioned
for
a
bronx
quimbleton
turned
to
the
unconscious
girl
devotees
he
said
ask
that
the
spirit
of
the
bronx
cocktail
vouchsafe
his
presence
among
us
miss
chuff
slender
figure
stiffened
again
her
hand
went
out
to
the
glass
beside
her
and
raised
it
to
her
lips
some
of
the
more
eagerly
credulous
afterwards
asserted
that
they
had
seen
a
cloudy
yellow
liquid
appear
in
the
vessel
but
it
is
not
improbable
that
the
wish
was
father
to
the
vision
at
any
rate
the
suppliants
experienced
at
that
instant
a
gush
of
sweet
coolness
down
their
throats
and
the
unmistakable
subsequent
tingle
they
gazed
at
each
other
with
a
wild
surmise
how
about
another
said
one
in
a
thrilling
whisper
take
your
turn
said
quimbleton
who
next
one
hundred
and
nominated
scotch
whiskey
the
order
was
filled
without
a
slip
quimbleton
face
beamed
above
his
beard
like
a
rose
magnificent
he
whispered
to
bleak
both
of
them
having
partaken
in
the
second
round
if
this
keeps
on
we
have
a
charge
of
the
tight
brigade
the
next
round
was
jack
rose
cocktails
but
the
audience
was
beginning
to
get
out
of
hand
those
who
had
not
yet
been
served
grew
restive
they
saw
their
companions
with
brightened
eyes
and
beaming
faces
comparing
notes
as
to
this
delicious
revival
of
old
sensations
in
the
impatience
of
some
and
the
jubilation
of
others
the
psychic
concentration
flagged
a
little
then
just
as
quimbleton
was
about
to
ask
for
the
fourth
round
the
unforgiveable
happened
some
one
at
the
back
shouted
a
glass
of
buttermilk
miss
chuff
shuddered
quivered
and
opened
her
eyes
with
a
tragic
gasp
she
slipped
from
the
chair
and
fell
exhausted
to
the
floor
bleak
ran
to
pick
her
up
quimbleton
screamed
out
an
oath
the
spell
is
broken
he
roared
there
a
spy
in
the
room
at
that
instant
a
battalion
of
armed
chuffs
burst
into
the
hall
they
carried
a
huge
hose
and
in
ten
seconds
a
stream
of
cold
water
was
being
poured
upon
the
bewildered
psychic
tipplers
quimbleton
and
bleak
seizing
the
girl
helpless
form
escaped
by
a
door
at
the
back
of
the
platform
heaven
help
us
cried
bleak
distraught
what
shall
we
do
this
means
the
firing
squad
unless
we
can
escape
theodolinda
feebly
opened
her
eyes
o
horrible
she
murmured
the
spirit
of
buttermilk
i
saw
him
he
threatened
me
the
horse
cried
quimbleton
with
fierce
energy
the
horse
in
the
stable
they
ran
wildly
to
the
rear
quarters
of
the
home
where
they
found
the
bishop
famous
charger
whinneying
in
his
stall
all
three
leaped
upon
his
back
in
the
confusion
amid
the
screams
of
the
tortured
inmates
and
the
cruel
cries
of
the
invading
chuffs
they
made
good
their
escape
every
one
of
the
wretched
inmates
captured
at
the
psychic
carouse
was
immediately
sentenced
to
six
months
hard
listening
on
the
chautauqua
circuit
but
even
during
this
brutal
punishment
their
memories
returned
with
tenderest
reminiscence
to
the
experience
of
that
afternoon
as
one
of
them
said
it
was
a
real
treat
and
although
quimbleton
had
plainly
stated
the
relation
in
which
he
stood
to
theodolinda
chuff
she
had
no
less
than
two
hundred
and
ten
proposals
of
marriage
by
mail
from
those
who
had
attended
the
seance
chapter
vii
the
decanterbury
pilgrims
through
a
dreary
waste
of
devastated
country
a
little
group
of
refugees
plodded
in
silence
all
about
them
lay
fields
and
orchards
which
had
been
torn
and
uprooted
as
though
by
some
unbelievable
whirlwind
at
a
watering
trough
along
the
road
they
halted
facing

forbidden
between
here
and
the
next
station
under
the
eye
of
an
armed
chuff
who
watched
them
suspiciously
the
wretched
wanderers
drank
the
water
in
silence
but
without
enthusiasm
then
they
shuffled
on
down
the
road
at
the
front
of
the
small
procession
a
slender
girl
in
a
sports
suit
rode
on
a
tall
black
horse
beside
the
horse
trudged
a
bulky
man
in
a
grotesque
garb
of
dirty
lavender
quilting
a
matted
whisk
of
coarse
beard
drooped
from
his
chin
but
his
blue
eyes
burned
brightly
in
his
sunburnt
face
over
his
shoulder
he
carried
a
six
foot
length
of
brass
railing
a
small
folding
table
and
a
shabby
knapsack
behind
the
horse
limped
a
lean
individual
in
a
palm
beach
suit
that
would
have
been
a
social
on
the
shining
sands
of
its
there
is
no
form
of
sartorialism
that
takes
on
such
utter
humility
as
a
palm
beach
suit
gone
wrong
this
particular
vestment
was
spotted
with
ink
with
mud
with
with
every
kind
of
stain
it
was
punctured
with
perforations
that
might
have
been
due
to
fallen
tobacco
tinder
the
individual
within
this
travesty
of
clothing
was
painfully
propelling
a
wheelbarrow
in
which
rode
not
without
complaint
a
substantial
woman
and
a
baby
an
older
child
trailed
from
the
palm
beach
these
jovial
vagabonds
as
the
reader
will
have
suspected
were
no
other
than
theodolinda
chuff
virgil
quimbleton
and
the
family
of
bleaks
affairs
had
gone
steadily
from
bad
to
worse
after
the
incident
or
as
some
blasphemously
called
it
the
miracle
at
cana
bishop
chuff
had
commenced
ruthless
warfare
enraged
beyond
control
by
the
perfidy
of
his
daughter
he
had
sent
out
the
armies
of
the
to
wreak
vengeance
on
every
human
enterprise
that
could
be
suspected
of
complicity
in
the
matter
of
fermentation
not
only
had
the
countryside
been
laid
waste
but
the
printing
press
had
been
abolished
and
all
publishing
trades
were
now
a
thing
of
the
past
this
of
course
had
thrown
dunraven
bleak
out
of
a
job
he
had
retrieved
his
wife
and
children
from
the
seashore
and
in
company
with
quimbleton
and
miss
chuff
and
the
noble
and
faithful
horse
john
barleycorn
they
had
led
a
nomad
existence
for
weeks
flying
from
bands
of
pursuing
chuffs
and
bravely
preaching
their
illicit
gospel
of
good
cheer
in
the
face
of
terrible
dangers
the
girl
who
was
indeed
the
jeanne
of
their
cause
was
their
sole
means
of
subsistence
it
was
her
psychic
powers
that
made
it
possible
for
them
in
a
furtive
way
to
give
their
little
entertainments
their
method
was
on
reaching
a
village
where
there
were
no
chuff
troops
to
distribute
certain
handbills
which
bleak
had
been
able
to
get
printed
by
stealth
these
read
thus
the
six
quimbletons
or
the
decanterbury
pilgrims
in
their
artistic
revival
of
old
and
entertaining
customs
tableaux
vivants
vanished
arts
folklore
games
and
conjuring
tricks
such
as
the
drinking
of
healths
toasts
nosepainting
the
lifted
elbow
let
match
for
it
say
when
light
or
dark
and
this
one
on
me
communion
with
departed
spirits
please
do
not
leave
before
the
hat
goes
round
having
taken
their
station
in
some
not
too
prominent
place
bleak
would
mount
the
wheelbarrow
and
play
coming
through
the
rye
on
a
this
his
sole
musical
accomplishment
was
exceedingly
distasteful
to
him
all
his
training
had
been
in
the
anonymity
of
a
newspaper
office
and
he
felt
his
public
humiliation
bitterly
when
a
crowd
had
gathered
quimbleton
would
ascend
the
barrow
and
make
a
brief
speech
of
a
highly
inflammatory
and
treasonable
nature
after
which
he
would
set
up
the
small
table
and
the
brass
rail
produce
a
white
apron
and
a
tumbler
from
his
knapsack
and
introduce
theodolinda
for
an
alcoholic
trance
it
was
found
that
the
public
entered
into
the
spirit
of
these
seances
with
great
gusto
and
often
the
collection
taken
up
was
gratifyingly
large
however
the
life
was
hazardous
in
the
extreme
and
they
were
in
perpetual
danger
of
meeting
secret
service
agents
it
was
only
by
repeated
private
trances
of
their
own
that
they
were
able
to
keep
up
their
morale
reaching
a
bend
in
the
way
where
a
grove
of
trees
cast
a
grateful
shade
the
decanterbury
pilgrims
halted
to
rest
quimbleton
helped
theodolinda
down
from
her
horse
and
they
all
sat
sadly
by
the
roadside
theo
said
quimbleton
as
he
wiped
his
brow
do
you
think
dear
that
if
i
set
up
the
table
you
could
give
us
a
little
trance
upon
my
soul
i
am
nearly
done
in
darling
virgil
said
theodolinda
i
really
ca
do
it
you
know
i
given
you
four
trances
already
this
morning
and
you
have
communed
with
the
soul
of
wurzburger
at
least
a
dozen
times
then
as
you
know
i
have
put
mr
bleak
in
touch
with
a
julep
six
or
seven
times
all
that
takes
it
out
of
me
dreadfully
i
really
must
consider
my
art
a
bit
i
do
want
to
be
a
mere
psychic
bartender
a
clairvoyant
distiller
you
are
quite
right
dear
girl
said
quimbleton
remorsefully
but
i
could
help
thinking
how
agreeable
a
psychical
seidel
of
dark
beer
would
be
just
now
you
are
our
little
jeanne
dark
you
know
he
added
with
an
atrocious
attempt
at
pleasantry
that
all
very
well
said
bleak
who
preferred
julep
to
beer
but
if
we
do
look
out
miss
chuff
will
go
into
a
permanent
trance
noticed
it
has
been
harder
and
harder
to
bring
her
back
from
these
states
of
suspended
sobriety
you
know
if
we
crowd
these
phantasms
of
the
grape
upon
her
too
fast
she
might
pass
over
altogether
and
stay
behind
the
bar
for
good
we
are
deeply
indebted
to
miss
chuff
for
her
adorable
willingness
to
act
as
a
kind
of
bunghole
into
the
spirit
world
but
we
do
want
her
to
slip
through
the
hole
and
evaporate
safety
thirst
cried
quimbleton
raising
his
loved
one
to
his
lips
we
ca
go
on
like
this
indefinitely
continued
bleak
i
do
mind
being
a
mountebank
but
mountebanks
do
pay
much
interest
i
rather
be
a
safe
deposit
somewhere
out
of
chuff
reach
there
too
much
drama
in
this
way
of
living
i
can
stand
the
drama
as
long
as
i
get
the
drams
said
the
unrepentant
quimbleton
well
wo
stand
it
exclaimed
mrs
bleak
shrilly
look
what
your
insane
schemes
have
brought
us
to
you
and
my
husband
seem
to
find
comfort
in
your
psychical
toping
but
i
do
notice
any
psychical
millinery
being
draped
about
for
miss
chuff
or
myself
and
look
at
the
children
they
simply
in
rags
if
you
really
loved
miss
chuff
i
should
think
you
be
ashamed
to
use
her
as
a
spiritual
demijohn
you
alienated
her
from
her
father
and
reduced
my
husband
from
managing
editor
of
a
leading
paper
to
managing
of
a
gang
of
psychic
bootleggers
she
burst
into
angry
tears
quimbleton
groaned
and
turned
a
ghastly
fade
upon
bleak
it
quite
true
he
said
in
the
excitement
miss
chuff
had
turned
very
pale
virgil
she
said
faintly
i
believe
i
feel
a
trance
coming
on
great
grief
cried
the
harassed
leader
not
now
my
darling
i
think
i
see
some
troops
in
the
distance
quick
try
to
concentrate
your
mind
on
lemonade
on
buttermilk
on
beef
tea
happily
this
crisis
passed
theodolinda
had
presence
of
mind
enough
to
pull
out
a
little
photograph
of
her
father
from
some
secret
hiding
place
and
by
putting
her
mind
on
it
shook
off
the
dominion
of
the
other
world
quimbleton
spoke
with
anguished
remorse
mrs
bleak
is
right
i
been
trying
to
hide
it
from
myself
but
i
can
do
so
no
longer
this
monkey
business
what
we
might
call
this
gorilla
warfare
must
stop
we
will
only
land
in
front
of
a
firing
squad
i
have
only
one
idea
which
i
have
been
saving
in
case
all
else
failed
the
bleaks
were
too
discouraged
to
comment
but
theodolinda
smiled
bravely
virgil
dear
she
said
your
ideas
are
always
so
original
what
is
it
quimbleton
stood
up
unconsciously
putting
one
foot
on
the
portable
brass
rail
which
rested
on
its
legs
by
the
roadside
his
tired
eyes
shone
anew
with
characteristic
enthusiasm
it
was
plain
that
he
imagined
himself
before
a
large
and
sympathetic
audience
my
friends
he
said
the
secret
of
eloquence
is
to
know
your
facts
or
as
the
chuff
would
amend
it
to
know
your
tracts
one
fact
i
think
i
may
say
is
plain
the
jig
is
up
or
more
literally
the
jag
is
up
i
can
see
now
that
alcohol
will
never
be
more
than
a
memory
principalities
and
powers
are
in
league
against
us
if
the
malt
has
lost
its
favor
wherewith
shall
it
be
malted
he
paused
a
moment
as
though
expecting
a
little
applause
and
theodolinda
murmured
an
encouraging
here
here
with
rekindled
eye
he
resumed
alcohol
i
say
will
never
be
more
than
a
memory
yet
even
a
memory
must
be
kept
alive
the
great
tradition
must
not
die
for
the
very
sake
of
antiquarian
accuracy
for
the
instruction
of
posterity
some
exact
record
must
be
kept
of
the
influence
of
alcohol
upon
the
human
soul
how
can
this
be
preserved
not
in
books
not
in
the
dead
mummies
of
a
museum
no
not
in
dead
mummies
indeed
but
in
living
rummies
that
brings
me
to
my
great
idea
which
i
have
long
cherished
i
propose
my
dear
friends
that
in
some
appropriate
shrine
surrounded
by
all
the
authentic
trappings
and
utensils
some
chosen
individual
be
maintained
at
the
public
charge
to
exhibit
for
the
contemplation
of
a
drouthing
world
the
immortal
flame
of
intoxication
he
will
be
known
without
soft
concealments
as
the
perpetual
souse
in
his
little
bar
served
by
austere
attendants
he
will
be
kept
in
a
state
of
gentle
exhilaration
nothing
gross
nothing
unseemly
i
insist
in
that
state
of
sweetly
glowing
mind
and
heart
in
that
ineffable
blossoming
of
all
the
nobler
qualities
of
human
dignity
this
priest
of
alcohol
will
represent
and
perpetuate
the
virtues
of
the
grape
booze
in
the
general
sense
will
have
gone
west
but
ah
how
fair
and
ruddy
a
sunset
will
it
have
in
the
person
of
this
its
vicar
there
he
will
live
visited
studied
revered
a
living
memorial
there
he
will
live
perpetually
in
a
mellow
fume
of
bliss
trailing
clouds
of
glory
as
if
as
some
poet
says
as
if
his
whole
vocation
were
endless
intoxication
and
now
my
friends
not
to
weary
you
with
the
minor
details
of
this
proposal
let
me
come
to
the
point
for
so
gravely
responsible
a
post
for
an
office
so
representative
of
the
ideals
and
ambitions
of
millions
the
choice
can
not
be
cast
haphazard
the
choice
must
fall
upon
one
qualified
confirmed
consecrated
to
this
end
this
deeply
significant
office
must
be
conferred
by
the
people
themselves
it
must
be
conferred
by
popular
election
candidates
must
be
nominated
must
stump
the
country
explaining
their
qualifications
and
let
me
say
that
upon
looking
over
the
whole
field
i
see
one
man
who
by
the
jury
of
his
peers
or
shall
i
say
by
the
jury
of
his
beers
is
supremely
fitted
for
this
post
it
is
my
intention
to
nominate
dunraven
bleak
for
the
office
of
perpetual
souse
there
was
a
moment
of
complete
silence
while
his
hearers
considered
the
vast
scope
of
this
remarkable
suggestion
it
is
only
fair
to
say
that
mr
bleak
face
had
at
first
lighted
up
but
then
he
glanced
at
his
wife
and
his
countenance
grew
pinched
he
spoke
hastily
a
very
generous
thought
my
dear
fellow
but
i
feel
that
you
would
be
far
more
competent
for
this
form
of
public
service
than
i
could
hope
to
be
your
modesty
does
you
credit
replied
quimbleton
but
you
forget
that
owing
to
my
relation
with
miss
chuff
i
shall
happily
be
precluded
from
the
necessity
of
entering
public
life
for
this
purpose
and
what
pray
said
mrs
bleak
with
distinct
asperity
is
to
become
of
me
and
the
children
if
mr
bleak
is
elected
to
this
preposterous
office
i
was
coming
to
that
said
quimbleton
eagerly
it
would
be
arranged
of
course
that
the
perpetual
souse
would
be
granted
a
liberal
salary
for
his
family
expenses
you
and
your
delightful
children
would
be
maintained
at
the
public
expense
in
a
suitable
bungalow
nearby
with
a
private
family
entrance
into
the
official
cellars
your
rank
of
course
would
be
that
of
perpetual
spouse
my
good
quimbleton
said
bleak
somewhat
bitterly
this
is
a
fascinating
vision
indeed
but
how
can
it
be
accomplished
how
would
you
ever
get
such
a
scheme
accepted
by
bishop
chuff
who
will
never
forgive
you
for
kidnaping
his
daughter
you
are
building
in
spain
my
dear
chap
you
are
blowing
mere
and
why
not
cried
his
friend
bishop
chuff
has
called
me
a
orator
at
any
rate
a
man
who
stands
upon
a
is
nearer
heaven
by
several
inches
than
the
man
who
stands
upon
the
ground
theodolinda
face
sparkled
with
the
impact
of
an
idea
come
she
said
it
not
impossible
after
all
i
have
a
thought
we
offer
father
an
armistice
and
talk
things
over
with
him
he
does
know
what
straits
we
in
and
maybe
we
can
bring
him
to
terms
he
was
very
badly
scared
by
those
gooseberry
bombs
and
maybe
we
can
bluff
him
into
a
concession
if
we
had
had
any
luck
said
quimbleton
we
would
have
blown
him
into
a
concussion
but
anyway
that
a
bonny
scheme
we
grant
him
a
truce
bleak
you
a
newspaper
man
just
get
hold
of
the
united
press
and
let
them
know
the
armistice
is
signed
bleak
smiled
wanly
at
the
thrust
all
right
he
said
let
go
but
what
your
idea
miss
chuff
we
must
have
something
to
base
negotiations
on
wait
and
see
she
cried
gayly
we
talk
it
over
as
we
go
along
mrs
bleak
aroused
her
children
who
had
fallen
asleep
and
climbed
back
into
the
wheelbarrow
i
do
know
that
i
approve
of
that
scheme
of
making
dunraven
the
perpetual
souse
she
remarked
i
can
imagine
what
my
poor
mother
would
say
about
it
if
she
were
living
she
came
of
fine
old
kentucky
stock
and
it
would
humiliate
her
deeply
to
know
to
what
a
level
we
had
been
reduced
my
dear
mrs
bleak
said
quimbleton
as
he
hoisted
his
betrothed
into
the
saddle
and
the
pilgrims
began
to
move
i
know
of
a
great
deal
of
good
old
kentucky
stock
that
has
had
a
far
worse
fate
than
that
in
these
tragic
years
chapter
viii
with
benefit
of
clergy
through
the
sullen
streets
of
the
terrorized
city
miss
chuff
quimbleton
and
bleak
proceeded
toward
the
great
building
where
the
had
their
headquarters
they
had
left
mrs
bleak
the
children
and
the
horse
at
a
quiet
in
the
suburbs
after
repeated
application
over
the
wireless
telephone
the
terrible
bishop
the
prohibishop
as
quimbleton
called
him
had
agreed
to
grant
them
an
audience
and
had
accorded
them
through
the
chuff
troops
even
so
their
progress
was
difficult
every
few
hundred
yards
they
were
halted
and
subjected
to
curt
inquiry
men
and
women
who
had
heard
of
their
gallant
struggle
against
fearful
odds
pressed
forward
in
an
attempt
to
seize
their
hands
to
embrace
and
applaud
them
but
these
evidences
of
enthusiasm
were
sternly
repressed
by
the
chuffs
bleak
was
frankly
nervous
as
they
approached
the
chuff
building
what
line
of
talk
are
we
going
to
adopt
he
asked
like
any
line
replied
quimbleton
ours
will
be
the
shortest
distance
between
two
points
the
first
point
is
that
we
want
to
obtain
something
from
chuff
the
second
is
that
we
have
some
information
to
give
him
which
will
be
of
immense
value
to
him
this
we
shall
hold
over
him
as
a
club
to
force
him
to
concede
what
we
want
and
what
is
this
club
asked
bleak
somewhat
suspicious
of
his
friend
sanguine
disposition
the
admirable
plan
said
quimbleton
is
theodolinda
idea
she
knows
her
father
better
than
we
do
she
says
that
his
passion
is
for
prohibiting
things
he
thinks
he
has
now
prohibited
everything
possible
we
are
in
a
position
to
tell
him
something
that
still
remains
unprohibited
his
eagerness
to
know
what
that
may
be
will
make
him
yield
to
our
request
bleak
pondered
gloomily
as
far
as
he
could
recall
the
prohibition
government
had
overlooked
nothing
the
quaint
part
of
it
was
that
some
of
its
prohibitions
carried
to
their
logical
extreme
had
curiously
overleaped
their
mark
for
instance
finding
it
impossible
to
enforce
the
laws
against
playing
games
on
sundays
the
government
had
concluded
that
the
only
way
to
make
the
sabbath
utterly
immaculate
was
to
abolish
it
altogether
which
was
done
other
laws
probably
based
upon
genuine
zeal
for
human
welfare
had
resulted
in
odd
evasions
or
legal
fictions
for
instance
people
were
forbidden
to
miss
trains
the
penalty
for
missing
a
train
was
ten
days
hard
labor
splitting
infinitives
in
the
government
rather
than
impose
this
harsh
punishment
on
any
one
engineers
would
permit
their
trains
to
loiter
about
the
stations
until
they
felt
certain
no
other
passengers
would
turn
up
consequently
no
trains
were
ever
on
time
and
the
government
was
forced
to
do
away
with
time
entirely
another
thing
that
was
abolished
was
hot
weather
it
had
been
found
too
tedious
to
tilt
the
axis
of
the
earth
therefore
all
the
thermometers
were
when
the
temperature
was
really
degrees
the
mercury
registered
only
degrees
and
every
one
was
saying
how
jolly
cool
it
was
for
the
time
of
year
this
of
course
was
careless
for
there
was
no
such
thing
as
time
or
year
but
still
people
kept
on
saying
it
bleak
was
thinking
over
these
matters
when
he
suddenly
recalled
that
it
was
forbidden
to
remember
things
as
they
had
been
under
the
old
regime
he
pulled
himself
up
with
a
start
in
order
to
make
his
mind
a
blank
he
tried
to
imagine
himself
about
to
write
a
leading
editorial
for
the
balloon
this
was
so
successful
that
he
did
not
come
to
earth
again
until
they
stood
in
the
or
as
quimbleton
called
it
the
of
the
bishop
who
is
to
be
spokesman
he
said
apprehensively
gazing
with
distaste
at
the
angular
females
who
were
pecking
at
typewriters
it
would
be
unseemly
for
me
to
present
my
own
claims
in
this
project
quimbleton
you
are
the
one
you
have
the
gift
of
the
tongue
i
would
rather
have
the
gift
of
the
bung
whispered
quimbleton
resolutely
as
they
were
ushered
into
the
inner
sanctum
the
dreaded
bishop
sat
at
an
immense
ebony
desk
the
room
was
furnished
like
his
mind
that
is
to
say
sparsely
and
without
any
southern
exposure
a
peculiarly
terrifying
feature
of
the
scene
was
that
the
top
of
the
desk
was
completely
bare
not
a
single
paper
lay
on
it
remembering
his
own
desk
in
the
newspaper
office
bleak
felt
that
this
was
unnatural
and
monstrous
he
noticed
a
breathoscope
on
the
mantelpiece
with
its
sensitive
needle
trembling
on
the
scaled
dial
which
read
thus
as
he
watched
the
indicator
oscillate
rapidly
on
the
dial
and
finally
subside
uncertainly
at
zero
he
thanked
heaven
that
they
had
indulged
in
no
psychic
grogs
that
day
the
bishop
black
beard
foamed
downward
upon
the
desk
like
a
gloomy
cataract
quimbleton
for
a
moment
was
almost
abashed
and
regretted
that
he
had
not
thought
to
whitewash
his
own
dingy
thicket
bishop
chuff
piercing
and
cruel
gaze
stabbed
all
three
he
ignored
theodolinda
with
contempt
his
disdain
was
so
complete
that
as
the
unhappy
girl
said
afterward
he
seemed
more
like
a
younger
brother
than
a
father
there
were
no
chairs
they
were
forced
to
stand
in
a
small
mirror
fastened
to
the
edge
of
his
desk
the
sneering
potentate
could
note
the
of
the
instrument
without
turning
he
watched
the
reflected
needle
flicker
and
come
to
rest
so
quimbleton
he
said
in
a
harsh
and
untuned
voice
you
come
comparatively
sober
strange
that
you
should
choose
to
be
unintoxicated
when
you
face
the
greatest
ordeal
of
your
life
the
savage
irony
of
this
angered
quimbleton
one
touch
of
liquor
makes
the
whole
world
kin
he
said
i
assure
you
i
have
no
desire
to
claim
kinship
with
your
bitter
and
intolerant
soul
ah
said
the
bishop
with
mock
politeness
you
relieve
me
greatly
i
had
thought
you
desired
to
claim
me
as
oh
parent
cried
theodolinda
how
can
you
be
so
cruel
sarcasm
is
such
a
low
form
of
humor
i
am
not
trying
to
be
humorous
said
the
bishop
grimly
you
who
were
once
the
apple
of
my
eye
are
now
only
an
apple
of
discord
you
whom
i
considered
such
a
promising
child
are
now
a
breach
of
promise
you
have
sucked
my
blood
you
are
a
vampire
the
vampire
on
whom
the
sun
never
sets
whispered
quimbleton
to
the
terrified
girl
encouraging
her
as
she
shrank
against
him
this
is
no
time
for
jest
said
the
bishop
angrily
you
said
you
had
a
matter
of
vital
import
to
lay
before
me
make
haste
and
remember
that
you
are
here
only
on
sufferance
i
shall
be
pitiless
i
shall
scourge
the
evil
principle
you
represent
from
the
face
of
the
earth
we
do
not
fear
your
threats
said
quimbleton
stoutly
we
are
not
alarmed
by
your
frown
he
was
greatly
but
he
was
sparring
for
time
to
put
his
thoughts
in
order
he
started
to
say
uneasy
lies
the
head
that
wears
a
frown
which
was
an
aphorism
of
his
own
he
thought
highly
of
but
theodolinda
checked
him
she
knew
that
her
father
detested
puns
it
was
perhaps
his
only
virtue
bishop
chuff
said
quimbleton
perhaps
you
are
not
aware
of
the
strength
and
tenacity
of
the
sentiment
we
represent
i
assure
you
that
if
you
underestimate
the
power
of
the
millions
of
thirsty
mouths
that
speak
through
us
you
will
rue
the
consequences
trouble
is
brewing
neither
trouble
nor
anything
else
is
brewing
nowadays
said
the
terrible
bishop
theodolinda
saw
that
quimbleton
was
losing
ground
by
his
incorrigible
habit
of
talking
before
he
said
anything
she
broke
in
impetuously
and
explained
the
plan
for
the
perpetual
souse
her
father
listened
to
the
end
with
his
cold
forbidding
gaze
while
the
sensitive
needle
of
the
recording
instrument
on
the
mantel
danced
and
wagged
in
agitation
so
this
is
your
scheme
is
it
he
said
abandoned
offspring
you
deserve
the
gallows
wait
a
moment
said
quimbleton
now
comes
the
other
side
of
the
argument
if
you
grant
us
this
concession
we
in
turn
will
put
you
in
possession
of
a
magnificent
idea
you
think
that
you
have
prohibited
everything
your
vetoes
cumber
the
earth
but
there
is
still
one
thing
you
have
forgotten
to
prohibit
what
is
it
said
the
bishop
coldly
his
hard
face
was
unmoved
but
his
eyes
brightened
a
trifle
there
is
one
thing
you
have
forgotten
to
prohibit
said
quimbleton
solemnly
i
can
hardly
conceive
how
it
escaped
you
the
one
thing
that
harasses
human
beings
over
the
whole
civilized
world
the
one
thing
which
if
you
were
to
abolish
it
would
make
your
name
foul
as
that
now
is
blessed
in
the
ears
of
men
oh
the
joy
of
still
having
something
to
prohibit
the
unmixed
bliss
and
high
privilege
of
the
vetoing
function
i
envy
you
from
my
heart
in
still
having
something
to
forbid
the
bishop
stirred
uneasily
in
his
chair
what
is
it
he
said
quimbleton
watched
him
with
a
steady
and
slightly
annoying
smile
i
like
to
dwell
in
imagination
upon
your
surprise
when
you
realize
what
you
have
overlooked
it
seems
so
simple
to
abolish
prohibit
banish
and
remove
at
one
swoop
the
chief
preoccupation
of
mankind
the
simple
and
felicity
of
still
having
something
prohibitable
subject
to
your
omnipotent
legislation
but
there
i
dare
say
i
am
wrong
probably
you
are
weary
of
prohibiting
things
quimbleton
made
a
motion
to
his
companions
as
though
to
leave
the
room
the
bishop
leaped
to
his
feet
with
curiously
mingled
anger
and
eagerness
on
his
face
stop
he
cried
you
ca
mean
laughter
i
abolished
that
some
weeks
ago
i
do
believe
there
is
anything
left
how
quaint
it
is
said
quimbleton
as
though
talking
to
himself
that
it
is
always
the
plainly
obvious
that
eludes
but
of
course
the
reason
you
have
not
abolished
this
matter
before
is
that
to
do
so
would
wholly
alter
and
undermine
the
habits
of
the
race
nothing
would
be
the
same
as
before
i
daresay
a
good
deal
of
misery
would
be
caused
in
the
long
run
who
knows
ah
well
it
seems
a
pity
you
forgot
it
hell
bells
roared
the
bishop
bringing
his
fist
down
on
the
desk
with
fury
what
is
it
let
me
get
at
it
i
should
be
sorry
to
marry
into
a
profane
family
was
reply
moving
toward
the
door
the
bishop
chewed
the
end
of
his
beard
with
a
crunching
sound
this
unpleasant
gesture
caused
a
tingle
to
pass
along
bleak
sensitive
spine
already
strained
to
painful
nervous
tension
the
office
of
the
perpetual
souse
hung
in
the
balance
look
here
said
bishop
chuff
if
i
let
you
have
your
way
about
the
the
permanent
exhibit
will
you
tell
me
what
it
is
i
have
forgotten
to
prohibit
with
pleasure
said
quimbleton
will
you
put
it
down
in
black
and
white
please
he
secured
the
bishop
signature
to
a
document
giving
instructions
for
the
necessary
legislation
to
be
passed
folding
the
precious
paper
in
his
pocket
quimbleton
faced
the
bishop
he
held
theodolinda
by
the
hand
i
am
sorry
he
said
that
i
should
have
forgotten
to
bring
a
ring
with
me
if
i
had
done
so
you
might
have
married
us
here
and
now
at
least
you
will
not
refuse
us
your
blessing
blessings
have
been
abolished
said
chuff
in
a
voice
of
exasperation
now
inform
me
what
it
is
that
i
have
forgotten
to
condemn
work
cried
quimbleton
and
the
three
ran
hastily
from
the
room
chapter
ix
the
election
in
the
days
following
quimbleton
coup
chuff
was
in
seclusion
it
was
rumored
that
he
was
ill
it
was
rumored
that
the
sounds
of
breaking
furniture
had
been
heard
by
the
neighbors
on
caraway
street
but
at
any
rate
the
bishop
lived
up
to
his
word
orders
over
his
signature
went
to
congress
and
vast
sums
of
money
were
appropriated
immediately
for
the
establishment
and
maintenance
of
a
national
park
with
suitable
buildings
and
appurtenances
wherein
might
be
maintained
an
elected
individual
in
a
state
of
freedom
with
access
to
alcoholic
beverages
in
order
that
successive
generations
might
view
for
themselves
the
devastating
effects
of
alcohol
upon
the
human
system
no
political
campaign
was
ever
contested
with
more
zeal
and
zest
than
that
which
led
up
to
the
election
of
the
perpetual
souse
life
had
grown
rather
dreary
under
the
innumerable
prohibitions
of
the
chuff
regime
and
the
citizens
welcomed
the
excitement
of
the
campaign
as
a
notable
diversion
quimbleton
appointed
himself
chairman
of
the
committee
to
nominate
bleak
and
the
editor
acting
under
his
instructions
had
hardly
begun
to
deny
vigorously
that
he
had
any
intention
of
being
a
candidate
before
he
found
himself
plunged
into
a
bewildering
vortex
of
meetings
speeches
and
confessions
of
faith
marching
clubs
properly
outfitted
with
silk
tiles
and
frock
coats
were
spatting
their
way
plumply
down
the
boulevard
torchlight
processions
tinted
the
night
ward
picnics
strewed
the
shells
of
eggs
on
the
lawns
of
suburban
amusement
parks
while
bleak
very
ill
at
ease
was
kissing
adhesive
babies
and
autographing
tissue
napkins
and
smiling
horribly
as
he
whirled
about
with
the
grandmothers
in
the
agony
of
the
carrousel
more
than
once
reeling
with
the
endless
circuit
of
a
painted
charger
the
perplexed
candidate
became
so
confused
that
he
kissed
the
paper
napkin
and
autographed
the
baby
he
found
quimbleton
a
stern
ringleader
virgil
was
not
satisfied
with
the
method
of
stumping
the
country
from
the
of
a
pullman
car
and
insisted
on
strapping
bleak
into
the
cockpit
of
a
biplane
and
flying
him
from
city
to
city
they
would
land
in
some
central
square
and
the
candidate
deafened
and
would
stammer
a
few
halting
remarks
he
felt
it
rather
keenly
that
quimbleton
looked
down
on
his
lack
of
oratorical
gift
and
it
was
a
frequent
humiliation
that
when
words
did
not
prosper
on
his
tongue
his
impatient
pilot
would
turn
on
the
motors
and
zoom
off
into
space
in
the
very
middle
of
a
sentence
nevertheless
the
campaign
went
famously
bleak
had
one
considerable
advantage
in
being
comparatively
unknown
he
had
never
permitted
himself
the
luxury
of
making
enemies
except
for
a
few
who
had
once
worked
on
the
balloon
he
had
not
a
foe
in
the
world
quimbleton
had
been
eager
to
import
a
covey
of
gunmen
from
other
cities
but
when
these
arrived
there
was
really
nothing
for
them
to
do
they
were
glad
to
accept
jobs
from
bishop
chuff
and
were
well
paid
for
waylaying
and
sniping
the
few
grapes
and
apples
that
had
escaped
previous
pogroms
there
was
only
one
plank
in
bleak
modest
platform
but
he
walked
it
so
happily
that
it
began
to
look
like
a
gangplank
leading
onto
the
ship
of
state
he
expressed
his
doctrine
very
agreeably
in
his
speech
accepting
the
party
nomination
though
credit
should
be
given
to
theodolinda
who
had
assisted
him
by
a
little
private
seance
before
he
addressed
the
convention
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
said
looking
as
he
spoke
at
one
of
the
handbills
announcing
his
candidacy
for
the
dignity
of
mouthpiece
of
the
nation
i
issue
dodgers
but
i
never
dodge
the
issue
i
can
take
it
or
let
it
alone
but
frankly
i
prefer
to
take
it
i
hope
i
speak
modestly
yet
candor
insists
that
both
by
past
training
and
present
inclination
i
feel
myself
fitted
to
deal
with
the
problems
of
this
exalted
office
if
elected
to
this
high
place
of
trust
i
shall
regard
myself
solely
as
the
servant
of
the
public
solely
as
the
representative
of
your
sovereign
will
as
i
raise
the
glass
or
peel
the
lemon
i
shall
not
act
in
any
individual
capacity
my
own
good
cheer
i
beg
you
to
believe
will
be
my
last
thought
i
shall
remember
in
every
gesture
and
every
gulp
that
my
thirst
is
in
reality
the
thirst
of
a
nation
delegated
to
me
by
ballot
that
my
laughter
and
song
if
things
should
go
so
far
are
truly
the
mirth
and
music
of
a
proud
people
expressing
themselves
through
me
i
shall
be
at
all
times
accessible
to
my
solicitous
to
hear
their
counsel
and
command
believing
as
i
do
in
moderation
yet
i
should
not
dream
of
permitting
private
sentiment
to
interfere
with
public
interest
when
more
violent
measures
should
seem
desirable
i
like
to
think
my
that
you
have
conferred
this
nomination
upon
me
not
wholly
at
random
i
like
to
think
that
i
am
only
expressing
your
thought
when
i
say
that
many
drinkers
have
been
the
worst
enemies
of
the
cause
we
all
hold
dear
the
alcoholshevik
and
the
the
i
wallow
in
wine
faction
have
done
much
to
discredit
the
old
bland
jeffersonian
toper
who
carried
tippling
to
the
level
of
a
fine
art
i
have
no
patience
with
the
doctrine
of
complete
immersion
ever
since
i
was
first
admitted
to
the
bar
i
have
deplored
the
conduct
of
those
violent
and
vulgar
revelers
who
have
brought
discredit
upon
the
loveliest
most
delicate
art
known
to
man
now
at
last
by
supreme
wisdom
drinking
is
to
be
elevated
to
the
dignity
of
a
career
i
like
to
think
that
i
express
your
sentiment
when
i
say
that
drinking
is
too
precious
too
subtle
too
fragile
a
function
to
be
entrusted
to
the
common
crowd
therefore
i
heartily
applaud
your
admirable
intention
of
entrusting
it
entirely
to
me
and
look
forward
with
profound
satisfaction
to
the
privilege
of
enshrining
and
perpetuating
in
my
own
person
the
genial
traditions
that
have
clustered
round
the
institution
of
liquor
if
elected
i
shall
endeavor
to
carry
on
the
fine
old
rituals
and
pass
them
down
unimpaired
to
the
next
incumbent
i
shall
endeavor
to
make
duty
a
pleasure
and
pleasure
a
duty
i
shall
remind
myself
that
i
am
only
performing
the
service
to
humanity
that
each
one
of
you
would
willingly
render
if
you
were
in
my
place
my
i
thank
you
for
your
amiable
confidence
and
am
happy
to
accept
the
nomination
there
were
some
who
criticized
this
speech
on
the
ground
that
it
was
too
academic
it
was
remembered
that
mr
bleak
had
at
one
time
been
a
and
his
opponents
were
quick
to
raise
the
cry
what
can
a
schoolmaster
know
about
liquor
it
was
said
that
mr
bleak
was
too
scholarly
too
aloof
too
that
his
interest
in
booze
was
merely
philosophical
that
he
would
be
incompetent
to
deal
with
the
practical
problems
of
actual
drinking
that
he
would
surround
himself
with
drinks
that
would
be
mere
puppets
subservient
entirely
to
his
own
purposes
the
adherents
of
jerry
purplevein
the
nominee
of
the
other
party
made
haste
to
assert
that
bleak
was
not
a
drinker
at
all
but
was
a
tool
of
the
chuff
machine
jerry
was
a
former
bartender
who
had
been
pining
away
in
the
cone

huge
banners
appeared
across
the
streets
showing
highly
colored
pictures
of

plying
his
original
profession
with
the
legend
rally
round
the
flagon
vote
for
purplevein
the
practical
man
one
of
the
exciting
features
of
the
campaign
was
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
woman
party
which
launched
an
boom
for
a
woman
souse
and
nominated
miss
cynthia
absinthe
as
its
candidate
the
idea
of
having
a
woman
elected
to
this
responsible
office
was
disconcerting
to
many
citizens
but
miss
absinthe
record
as
outlined
by
her
publicity
headquarters
compelled
respect
she
was
reputed
to
have
been
a
passionate
and
tumultuous
consumer
of
sloe
gin
and
thousands
of
women
in
white
bartenders
coats
marched
with
banners
announcing
absinthe
makes
the
heart
grow
fonder
vote
for
cynthia
and
our
slogan
is
sloe
gin
for
a
while
there
was
quite
a
probability
that
the
male
vote
would
be
so
split
by
bleak
and
purplevein
that
miss
absinthe
would
come
in
ahead
but
at
the
height
of
the
campaign
she
was
found
in
a
pharmacy
drinking
a
maple
nut
foam
after
this
her
cause
declined
rapidly
and
even
her
most
ardent
partisans
admitted
that
she
would
never
be
more
than
an
intermittent
souse
purplevein
followers
in
their
desperate
efforts
to
discredit
bleak
overplayed
their
hand
as
practical
politicians
always
do
the
sagacious
quimbleton
outmaneuvered
them
at
every
turn
moderate
drinkers
rallied
round
bleak
moreover
the
bleak
party
had
an
irresistible
assistant
in
the
person
of
miss
chuff
who
put
her
trances
unreservedly
at
dunraven
disposal
in
this
way
quimbleton
was
able
to
produce
his
candidate
before
a
monster
mass
meeting
at
the
opera
house
in
a
state
of
becoming
exhilaration
this
forever
put
an
end
to
the
rumor
that
bleak
was
not
a
practical
man
miss
chuff
also
campaigned
strenuously
among
the
women
where
purplevein
being
a
bachelor
was
at
a
disadvantage
vote
for
bleak
cried
miss
chuff
he
has
a
wife
to
help
him
purplevein
argument
that
the
office
of
perpetual
souse
should
be
an
entirely
stag
affair
fell
dead
before
glowing
description
of
the
hostess
house
which
mrs
bleak
would
conduct
next
door
to
the
little
temple
which
was
to
be
erected
by
the
government
for
the
successful
candidate
despite
the
exhaustion
of
the
campaign
bleak
stood
it
well
quimbleton
knowing
the
disastrous
effects
of
kept
his
man
at
fighting
edge
by
a
little
judicious
pessimism
now
and
then
and
rumors
of
the
popularity
of
purplevein
among
the
hard
drinkers
day
after
day
quimbleton
and
miss
chuff
after
a
little
psychic
communing
would
prop
the
editor
among
cushions
in
the
big
gray
limousine
and
spin
him
about
the
city
and
suburbs
to
bow
smile
say
a
few
automatic
words
and
pass
on
over
the
car
floated
a
big
banner
with
the
words
let
bleak
do
your
drinking
for
you
he
knows
how
the
unhappy
purplevein
who
had
to
do
his
electioneering
in
a
state
of
chill
sobriety
was
aghast
to
see
the
beaming
and
gently
flushed
face
of
his
rival
radiating
cheer
at
the
eleventh
hour
he
tried
to
change
his
tactics
and
plastered
the
billboards
with
immense
posters
bleak
does
need
the
job
he
soused
already
this
line
of
argument
might
perhaps
have
been
powerful
if
adopted
earlier
but
by
that
time
the
agreeable
vision
of
bleak
ascetic
features
wreathed
in
a
faintly
spiritual
benignance
was
already
firmly
fixed
in
the
public
imagination
the
little
celluloid
button
showing
his
transfigured
and
endearing
smile
was
worn
on
millions
of
lapels
as
one
walked
down
the
street
one
met
that
little
badge
hundreds
of
times
and
the
mere
repetition
of
the
tenderly
exhilarated
face
seemed
to
many
a
citizen
a
beautiful
and
significant
thing
men
are
altruistic
at
heart
they
saw
that
bleak
would
make
of
this
high
office
a
richly
eloquent
and
appealing
stewardship
they
were
reconciled
to
their
own
abstinence
in
the
thought
that
the
dreams
and
desires
of
their
own
hearts
would
be
so
nobly
fulfilled
by
him
alcohol
was
gone
forever
and
perhaps
it
was
as
well
they
themselves
were
conscious
of
having
abused
its
sacred
powers
but
now
in
the
person
of
this
chosen
representative
all
that
was
lovely
and
laughable
in
the
old
customs
would
be
consecrated
and
enshrined
forever
men
who
had
known
bleak
in
the
days
of
his
employment
on
the
balloon
recollected
that
even
during
the
cares
and
efforts
of
his
profession
little
incidents
had
occurred
that
might
have
shown
had
they
been
shrewd
enough
to
notice
how
faithfully
he
was
preparing
himself
for
the
great
responsibility
destiny
held
concealed
the
day
of
the
election
was
declared
a
national
festival
the
chuff
government
a
good
deal
startled
by
the
universal
seriousness
and
enthusiasm
shown
in
the
enrollment
at
the
primaries
was
disposed
in
secret
to
regard
the
office
of
perpetual
souse
as
a
helpful
compromise
on
a
vexed
question
the
war
against
nature
had
been
only
partially
successful
indeed
the
chuff
declared
that
nature
had
not
learned
her
lesson
yet
and
that
some
irreconcilable
berries
and
fruits
were
still
waging
a
guerilla
fermentation
thus
rupturing
the
armistice
terms
the
countryside
had
been
ravaged
all
the
chautauqua
lecturers
were
hoarse
industry
was
at
a
standstill
misery
and
despair
were
widespread
even
the
indomitable
chuff
himself
was
a
little
nonplussed
better
he
thought
one
man
indubitably
decorously
publicly
and
legally
drunk
than
millions
of
citizens
privily
attempting
to
cajole
raisins
and
apples
into
illicit
sprightliness
the
citizens
went
to
the
polls
in
a
mood
of
exalted
they
knew
that
they
were
voting
away
their
own
rights
but
they
also
knew
that
their
private
ideals
would
be
more
than
realized
in
the
legalized
frenzy
of
their
representative
bleak
appearing
on
the
balcony
of
his
hotel
smiled
affectionately
on
the
loyal
faces
that
cheered
him
from
below
he
was
deeply
moved
to
quimbleton
who
was
supporting
him
from
behind
he
said
their
generosity
is
wonderful
i
shall
try
to
be
worthy
of
their
confidence
i
hope
i
may
have
strength
to
put
into
practice
the
frustrated
desires
of
these
noble
people
the
result
of
the
polling
was
to
be
announced
by
a
searchlight
from
the
city
hall
a
white
beam
sweeping
eastward
would
mean
the
election
of
purplevein
a
white
beam
sweeping
westward
would
mean
the
triumph
of
miss
absinthe
a
steady
red
beam
cast
upward
toward
the
zenith
would
indicate
the
victory
of
bleak
at
ten
that
night
a
scream
of
cheers
burst
from
millions
of
people
packed
along
the
city
streets
a
clear
glowing
shaft
of
red
light
leaped
upward
into
the
sky
dunraven
bleak
had
been
elected
perpetual
souse
purplevein
who
was
rather
a
decent
sort
hastened
to
bleak
hotel
to
offer
his
congratulations
bleak
who
was
sitting
quietly
with
mrs
bleak
quimbleton
and
theodolinda
greeted
him
calmly
poor
purplevein
was
very
much
broken
up
and
quimbleton
and
theodolinda
in
the
goodness
of
their
hearts
arranged
a
quiet
little
seance
for
his
benefit
they
all
sat
their
drinking
psychic
in
honor
of
the
event
as
quimbleton
said
helping
purplevein
back
to
his
motor
hitch
your
flagon
to
a
star
chapter
x
e
pluribus

virgil
and
theodolinda
were
returning
from
their
honeymoon
which
they
had
spent
touring
in
quimbleton
spad
plane
they
had
been
in
south
america
most
of
the
time
where
they
found
charming
hosts
eager
to
console
them
for
the
tragical
developments
in
the
northern
continent
it
was
a
superb
morning
in
early
autumn
when
they
were
flying
homeward
beneath
them
lay
the
green
and
level
meadows
of
new
jersey
and
the
dusky
violet
blue
of
the
ocean
shading
to
a
translucent
olive
where
long
ridges
of
foam
crumbled
upon
pale
beaches
they
turned
inland
flying
leisurely
to
admire
the
beauty
of
the
scene
the
mounting
sun
spread
a
golden
shimmer
over
woods
and
white
roads
ran
like
ribbons
across
the
landscape
quimbleton
glided
gently
downward
intending
to
skim
low
over
the
treetops
so
that
his
bride
might
enjoy
the
rich
loveliness
of
the
view
suddenly
the
great
plane
dipped
sharply
tilted
and
very
nearly
fell
into
a
quimbleton
was
just
able
to
pull
her
up
again
and
climbed
steeply
to
a
safer
altitude
he
looked
at
his
dashboard
dials
and
indicators
with
a
puzzled
face
very
queer
he
said
to
theodolinda
through
the
speaking
tube
the
air
here
has
very
little
carrying
power
it
seems
extraordinarily
thin
you
might
think
we
were
flying
in
a
partial
vacuum
from
the
behavior
of
the
plane
it
was
evident
that
some
curious
atmospheric
condition
was
prevailing
there
seemed
to
be
a
large
hole
or
pocket
in
the
air
and
in
spite
of
his
best
efforts
the
pilot
was
unable
to
get
on
even
wing
finally
fearing
to
lapse
into
a
tail
spin
he
planed
down
to
make
a
landing
beneath
them
was
a
beautiful
green
lawn
surrounded
by
groves
of
trees
in
the
middle
of
this
lawn
they
struck
gently
taxied
across
the
smooth
turf
and
came
to
a
stop
beneath
a
splendid
oak
quimbleton
assisted
his
wife
to
get
out
and
they
sat
down
for
a
few
minutes
rest
under
the
tree
what
a
heavenly
spot
cried
theodolinda
i
wonder
where
we
are
somewhere
in
new
jersey
said
her
husband
i
do
understand
what
was
the
matter
with
the
air
it
did
act
according
to
hoyle
they
gazed
about
them
in
some
surprise
at
the
opulent
beauty
of
the
scene
it
seemed
to
be
a
kind
of
park
laid
out
in
lawns
gardens
and
shrubbery
with
groves
of
old
trees
here
and
there
a
little
artificial
lake
twinkled
in
a
hollow
they
happened
to
be
gazing
upward
when
a
small
round
ball
of
tawny
color
fell
from
the
tree
it
was
a
robin
folded
solidly
for
sleep
he
fell
unresisting
by
the
flutter
of
a
wing
turning
over
and
over
gently
until
he
struck
the
turf
with
the
tiniest
of
soft
thuds
he
bounced
slightly
rolled
a
little
distance
and
settled
motionless
in
the
grass
quimbleton
amazed
stooped
over
the
fallen
bird
supposing
it
to
be
dead
without
lifting
it
from
the
ground
he
withdrew
its
head
from
under
its
wing
the
bright
eye
unlidded
and
gazed
at
him
sleepily
then
the
bird
closed
its
eye
with
a
certain
weary
resignation
put
its
head
back
under
its
wing
and
relaxed
comfortably
in
the
grass
quimbleton
was
no
very
acute
student
of
nature
but
this
seemed
very
odd
to
him
and
then
examining
the
lower
limbs
of
the
tree
he
uttered
an
exclamation
he
swung
himself
up
into
the
oak
and
shook
one
of
the
branches
five
other
birds
plopped
comfortably
into
the
grass
and
rested
as
easily
as
the
first
he
examined
them
one
by
one
they
were
all
sound
asleep
most
amazing
he
said
my
dear
we
will
have
to
take
up
nature
study
i
am
really
ashamed
of
my
ignorance
i
always
thought
that
owls
were
the
only
birds
that
slept
by
day
theodolinda
was
looking
at
the
five
small
bodies
she
raised
one
of
them
gently
and
sniffed
gingerly
virgil
she
said
solemnly
this
is
not
mere
slumber
these
birds
are
drunk
quimbleton
was
about
to
speak
when
a
grasshopper
went
by
like
an
airplane
zooming
in
a
leap
a
bee
sagged
along
heavily
in
an
irregular
and
a
caterpillar
more
agile
and
purposeful
than
any
caterpillar
they
had
ever
seen
staggered
swiftly
across
a
carpet
of
moss
the
same
thought
struck
them
simultaneously
and
at
that
moment
theodolinda
noticed
a
small
white
signboard
affixed
to
a
in
the
grove
they
ran
to
it
and
saw
in
neat
lettering
to
the
perpetual
souse
one
mile
bless
me
cried
quimbleton
what
a
stroke
of
luck
you
know
old
bleak
wrote
us
when
we
were
in
rio
that
he
had
been
installed
in
his
temple
but
he
did
say
where
it
was
let
toddle
up
and
have
a
look
at
him
that
why
the
bus
acted
so
queerly
no
wonder
we
were
probably
flying
in
alcohol
vapor
they
walked
through
the
grove
and
emerged
upon
a
lawn
that
sloped
gently
upward
at
the
brow
stood
a
beautiful
little
temple
of
greek
architecture
as
they
approached
they
read
carved
into
the
marble
architrave
aedes
temulenti
perpetui
e
pluribus
unum
the
little
porch
under
the
marble
columns
was
cool
and
shady
a
signboard
said
visiting
hours
noon
to
midnight
quimbleton
looked
at
his
watch
it
not
noon
yet
he
said
but
as
we
old
friends
i
dare
say
he
be
willing
to
see
us
pushing
through
a
slatted
swinging
door
of
beautifully
carved
bronze
they
found
themselves
in
a
charmingly
furnished
reference
library
there
were
lounges
and
deep
leather
chairs
and
ash
trays
for
smokers
quimbleton
who
was
something
of
a
bookworm
ran
his
eye
along
the
shelves
a
very
neat
idea
he
said
they
have
collected
a
little
library
of
all
the
standard
works
on
drink
this
should
be
of
great
value
to
future
historians
and
researchers
through
another
swinging
door
they
found
the
central
shrine
it
was
circular
in
shape
illuminated
through
a
clear
skylight
under
the
rotunda
was
a
low
broad
marble
counter
surmounted
by
a
gleaming
mirror
and
a
noble
array
of
bottles
flasks
decanters
goblets
and
glasses
of
every
size
the
pale
yellow
of
white
wines
the
ruby
of
claret
the
tawny
brown
of
port
the
green
and
violet
and
rose
of
various
liqueurs
sparkled
in
their
appointed
vessels
in
front
of
this
altar
stood
a
mahogany
bar
with
its
scrolled
rim
and
diminutive
brass
rail
all
complete
a
red
velvet
cord
hung
from
brass
posts
separated
it
from
the
open
floor
a
series
of
mural
paintings
in
the
vivid
coloring
and
superb
technique
of
maxfield
parrish
adorned
the
walls
of
the
room
they
portrayed
the
history
of
alcohol
from
the
dawn
of
time
down
to
the
summer
of
a
space
for
one
more
painting
was
left
blank
and
and
quimbleton
concluded
that
the
artist
was
still
at
work
upon
the
final
panel
an
attendant
in
white
was
polishing
glasses
behind
the
tiny
bar
he
was
an
elderly
man
with
a
pink
face
and
the
initials
were
embroidered
on
the
collar
of
his
starched
jacket
there
was
an
air
of
evident
pride
in
his
bearing
as
he
listened
to
their
exclamations
of
admiration
your
first
visit
sir
he
said
yes
said
quimbleton
i
must
confess
i
had
no
idea
it
would
be
as
fine
as
this
what
time
does
mr
bleak
get
in
he
usually
opens
up
with
a
nip
of
scotch
about
said
the
bartender
just
so
as
to
get
up
a
little
circulation
before
opening
time
he
got
a
hard
afternoon
before
him
he
added
how
do
you
mean
said
quimbleton
one
of
the
excursion
trains
coming
the
railroad
runs
cheap
excursions
here
three
days
a
week
and
the
crowds
is
enormous
when
there
a
bunch
like
that
there
always
a
lot
wants
mr
bleak
to
take
some
special
drink
they
used
to
be
partial
to
just
to
recall
old
times
of
course
being
what
you
might
call
a
servant
of
the
public
he
like
not
to
oblige
but
i
doubt
whether
he
got
the
constitution
to
stand
it
long
the
other
day
the
mint
julep
veterans
of
kentucky
held
a
memorial
day
here
and
mr
bleak
had
to
sink
fifteen
juleps
to
satisfy
them
i
tell
him
not
to
push
himself
too
far
but
he
still
pretty
new
at
the
job
he
likes
to
go
over
the
top
every
day
your
face
is
very
familiar
said
theodolinda
where
have
we
seen
you
before
i
wondered
if
you
recognize
me
said
the
bartender
i
shaved
off
my
mustache
i
jerry
purplevein
when
i
was
turned
down
in
that
election
i
thought
this
would
be
the
next
best
thing
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
better
i
do
really
care
for
the
stuff
i
just
like
to
see
it
around
miss
absinthe
felt
the
same
way
she
head
stewardess
up
to
the
hostess
house
it
seems
to
me
i
used
to
see
you
somewhere
in
new
york
said
quimbleton
i
was
head
bar
at
the
hotel
pennsylvania
said
jerry
we
had
the
finest
bar
in
the
world
had
only
been
running
a
couple
of
months
when
prohibition
come
in
they
turned
it
into
a
soda
fountain
ah
that
was
a
tragedy
but
this
is
a
grand
job
government
service
you
see
sure
pay
tony
surroundings
and
what
you
might
call
steady
custom
mr
bleak
is
as
nice
a
gentleman
to
mix
for
as
i
ever
see
but
what
is
this
for
asked
theodolinda
pointing
to
a
beautiful
marble
cash
register
surely
mr
bleak
does
have
to
buy
his
drinks
no
said
jerry
but
he
likes
to
have
rung
up
same
as
customary
he
says
it
makes
it
seem
more
natural
here
he
is
now
jerry
flew
to
attention
behind
the
bar
and
they
turned
to
see
their
friend
enter
through
the
bronze
swinging
doors
well
well
cried
bleak
this
is
a
delightful
surprise
he
was
dressed
in
a
lounging
suit
of
fine
texture
and
while
he
seemed
a
little
thinner
and
paler
and
his
eyes
a
little
weary
he
was
in
excellent
spirits
come
he
said
you
just
in
time
for
a
bite
of
lunch
jerry
what
on
the
counter
jerry
bustled
proudly
over
to
the
counter
whipped
off
the
and
disclosed
a
fragrant
joint
of
corned
beef
nestling
among
cabbages
and
boiled
potatoes
with
the
delight
of
the
true
artist
he
seized
a
long
narrow
carving
knife
gave
it
a
few
passes
along
a
steel
and
sliced
off
generous
portions
of
the
beef
onto
plates
bearing
the
monogram
this
they
supplemented
with
other
selections
from
the
liberally
supplied
counter
soft
crumbling
orange
cheese
pickles
smoked
sardines
chopped
liver
olives
pretzels
all
the
appetizers
were
laid
out
on
broad
silver
platters
i
wish
i
could
offer
you
a
drink
said
bleak
but
as
you
know
it
would
be
unconstitutional
with
your
permission
i
shall
have
to
have
something
my
office
hours
begin
shortly
and
some
one
might
come
in
he
took
up
his
station
at
the
little
bar
behind
the
velvet
cord
and
slid
his
left
foot
onto
the
miniature
rail
jerry
with
the
air
of
an
artist
about
to
resume
work
on
his
favorite
masterpiece
stood
expectant
a
little
scotch
jerry
said
bleak
in
the
manner
reminiscent
of
an
elder
day
jerry
wiped
away
imaginary
moisture
from
the
mahogany
with
a
deft
circular
movement
of
a
white
cloth
turning
to
the
gleaming
pyramid
of
glassware
he
set
out
the
decanter
of
whiskey
a
small
empty
glass
and
a
twin
glass
full
of
water
his
motions
were
elaborately
careless
and
automatic
but
he
was
plainly
bursting
with
joy
to
be
undergoing
such
expert
and
affectionate
scrutiny
bleak
poured
out
three
fingers
of
whiskey
and
held
up
the
baby
tumbler
here
to
the
happy
couple
he
cried
and
drank
it
in
one
swift
practiced
gesture
he
then
swallowed
about
a
tablespoonful
of
the
water
jerry
removed
the
utensils
again
wiped
the
immaculate
bar
and
rang
the
cashless
the
perpetual
souse
smiled
happily
that
how
it
done
he
said
do
you
remember
we
just
back
from
south
america
said
quimbleton
some
of
the
boys
from
the
old
balloon
office
were
in
here
the
other
day
said
bleak
i
afraid
it
was
rather
too
much
for
them
in
an
emotional
way
i
mean
i
tossed
off
a
few
for
their
benefit
and
one
of
them
the
cartoonist
he
used
to
be
perhaps
you
remember
him
fainted
with
excitement
well
how
do
you
like
the
job
said
quimbleton
bleak
did
not
answer
this
directly
making
an
apology
to
jerry
and
promising
to
be
back
in
a
few
minutes
he
escorted
his
visitors
round
the
temple
and
gave
them
some
of
the
picture
postcards
of
himself
that
were
sold
to
souvenir
hunters
at
five
cents
each
he
showed
them
the
cafeteria
for
the
convenience
of
visitors
the
hostess
house
where
they
found
mrs
bleak
comfortably
installed
the
machinery
the
private
brewery
and
the
used
to
transport
supplies
in
a
corner
of
the
garden
they
found
the
children
playing
it
a
good
thing
the
children
enjoy
playing
with
empty
bottles
said
bleak
it
getting
to
be
quite
a
problem
to
know
what
to
do
with
them
i
using
some
of
them
to
make
a
path
across
the
lawn
bury
them
bottom
up
you
know
but
you
ask
how
i
like
it
i
would
never
admit
it
before
jerry
because
the
good
fellow
expects
more
of
me
than
i
am
able
to
fulfill
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
is
hardly
a
job
there
ought
to
be
at
least
seven
of
us
each
to
go
on
duty
one
day
a
week
no
you
see
being
a
kind
of
government
museum
i
do
even
get
sundays
off
because
lots
of
people
can
only
get
here
that
day
next
after
mount
vernon
and
independence
hall
i
get
more
visitors
than
any
other
national
shrine
and
almost
all
of
them
expect
me
to
have
a
go
at
their
favorite
drink
while
they
watching
me
being
what
you
might
call
the
most
public
spirited
man
in
the
country
i
have
to
oblige
them
as
much
as
possible
but
i
doubt
whether
i
shall
be
a
candidate
for
reelection
i
think
the
government
has
rather
overestimated
my
capacity
he
continued
they
import
a
shipload
of
stuff
from
abroad
every
month
and
send
an
auditor
here
to
check
over
my
empties
i
been
hard
put
to
it
to
get
away
with
all
the
stuff
i
had
to
fall
back
on
your
old
plan
of
using
wine
to
irrigate
the
garden
it
had
rather
a
dissipating
effect
on
the
birds
and
insects
though
really
you
ought
to
spend
an
evening
here
some
time
the
birds
sing
all
night
long
they
have
to
sleep
it
off
in
the
morning
a
robin
with
a
is
one
of
the
funniest
things
in
the
world
we
saw
one
cried
theodolinda
he
was
more
than
hanging
over
he
had
fallen
right
off
there
a
butterfly
here
said
bleak
rather
a
friend
of
mine
who
can
give
a
bumble
bee
the
after
he
gets
his
drop
of
rum
seen
him
chase
a
wasp
all
over
the
lot
from
the
temple
came
the
sound
of
chimes
striking
twelve
and
down
in
the
valley
they
heard
the
whistle
of
a
train
there
the
excursion
train
leaving
souse
junction
said
bleak
i
must
get
back
to
the
bar
they
returned
to
the
shrine
and
bleak
entered
his
little
enclosure
jerry
he
said
the
crowd
will
soon
be
here
i
must
get
busy
what
do
you
recommend
better
stick
to
the
scotch
said
jerry
and
put
the
decanter
on
the
mahogany
bleak
drank
two
slugs
hastily
and
turned
to
his
friends
with
an
almost
wistful
air
come
again
and
stay
longer
he
said
i
see
so
many
strangers
i
get
homesick
for
a
friendly
face
he
called
quimbleton
aside
does
quimbleton
keep
up
her
trances
he
whispered
not
recently
said
virgil
you
see
in
south
america
there
was
no
necessity
but
when
we
get
settled
you
are
a
lucky
fellow
whispered
bleak
all
the
enjoyment
without
any
of
the
formalities
and
he
added
aloud
grasping
their
hands
next
time
come
in
the
evening
a
man
in
my
line
of
work
is
hardly
at
his
best
before
nightfall
as
they
walked
back
to
the
plane
and
quimbleton
saw
the
excursionists
a
thousand
or
so
hastening
through
the
park
on
foot
and
in
huge
cars
where
men
with
megaphones
were
roaring
comments
one
group
of
pedestrians
bore
a
large
banner
lettered
egg
nog
memorial
association
of
camden
j
poor
mr
bleak
said
theodolinda
on
top
of
all
that
scotch
when
they
took
the
air
again
they
circled
over
the
temple
at
a
safe
height
they
could
see
the
crowd
gathered
densely
round
the
little
white
columns
virgil
shut
off
the
motor
for
a
moment
and
even
at
that
distance
they
could
hear
the
sound
of
cheers
chapter
xi
it
a
long
worm
that
has
no
turning
bishop
chuff
sat
sourly
in
his
office
and
sighed
for
more
worlds
to
canker
round
the
room
stood
the
tall
filing
cases
containing
card
indexes
of
prohibited
offences
and
he
looked
gloomily
over
the
crowded
drawers
in
the
vain
hope
of
finding
something
that
had
been
overlooked
he
pulled
out
a
drawer
at
random
schedule
minor
social
offenses
and
ran
his
embittered
eye
over
a
card
it
was
marked
conversational
felonies
and
began
thus
arguing
blandishing
buffoonery
contradicting
demurring
ejaculating
exaggerating
facetiousness
giggling
hemming
and
hawing
implying
insisting
jesting
each
item
also
referred
to
another
card
on
which
the
penalty
was
noted
and
legal
test
cases
summarized
no
he
brooded
there
is
nothing
left
even
the
most
loyal
of
the
bishop
staff
admitted
that
he
was
far
from
well
and
it
was
decided
that
he
ought
to
take
a
vacation
he
himself
concurred
in
this
and
as
the
home
resorts
were
no
longer
places
of
mirth
and
glee
he
determined
to
go
to
europe
this
would
have
the
added
advantage
of
enabling
him
to
spend
some
time
conferring
with
prohibition
leaders
abroad
as
to
ways
and
means
of
converting
europe
to
his
schemes
of
reform
everyone
in
the
office
showed
genuine
unselfishness
in
making
plans
for
the
bishop
vacation
and
he
was
urged
to
stay
away
as
long
as
he
felt
he
could
be
spared
europe
too
was
much
excited
over
the
prospect
of
his
coming
and
the
british
prime
minister
was
questioned
on
the
subject
in
the
house
of
commons
for
his
entertainment
on
the
voyage
a
set
of
twelve
beautiful
folio
volumes
bound
in
black
morocco
were
prepared
they
contained
a
digest
of
prohibition
legislation
which
chuff
had
been
instrumental
in
having
put
on
the
statutes
for
the
first
time
in
years
the
bishop
was
cheered
as
he
passed
about
the
streets
and
he
realized
that
he
had
never
known
how
popular
he
was
until
it
was
announced
that
he
was
going
away
but
still
he
was
not
content
one
morning
not
long
before
the
date
set
for
his
sailing
he
sat
gloomily
at
his
desk
he
was
engaged
in
making
his
will
and
had
found
to
his
secret
bitterness
that
after
bequeathing
a
few
personal
trinkets
to
the
office
staff
there
was
really
no
one
to
whom
he
could
leave
the
bulk
of
his
misfortune
theodolinda
of
course
he
had
quite
cut
off
from
his
estate
he
only
knew
that
she
was
living
somewhere
with
the
degraded
quimbleton
carrying
on
a
little
psychic
tavern
which
no
laws
could
reach
in
a
state
of
criminal
happiness
from
the
street
far
beneath
his
open
window
he
heard
the
clamor
of
a
police
patrol
and
leaned
eagerly
over
the
sill
in
the
hope
of
seeing
something
that
would
cheer
his
black
mood
but
it
was
only
a
man
being
arrested
for
leaning
against
a
a
rather
common
offence
at
that
time
for
most
of
the
normal
occupations
of
the
citizens
had
been
prohibited
and
they
mooned
about
the
highways
in
a
state
of
listless
discontent
but
then
farther
down
the
channel
of
the
street
he
saw
something
that
caught
his
eye
a
group
of
people
were
marching
with
flags
and
signs
toward
the
railway
station
saturday
school
picnic
to
souse
temple
he
read
on
a
banner
he
noticed
that
in
spite
of
all
the
laws
against
smiling
in
public
these
people
bore
a
look
of
suppressed
merriment
they
were
obviously
out
for
a
good
time
a
sudden
thought
struck
him
that
afternoon
in
impenetrable
disguise
the
bishop
paid
his
first
visit
to
the
temple
of
dunraven
bleak
the
next
morning
when
his
subordinates
came
to
see
him
about
the
final
plans
for
his
departure
they
were
horrified
to
find
him
sitting
at
his
desk
wearing
in
the
recesses
of
his
beard
what
would
have
been
called
on
any
other
man
a
smile
i
have
changed
my
mind
he
said
i
am
not
going
away
they
cried
out
in
amazement
and
pointed
out
to
him
how
sorely
in
need
of
relaxation
he
was
i
am
planning
relaxation
he
said
and
that
was
all
they
could
get
out
of
him
later
in
the
day
a
confidential
messenger
was
dispatched
to
the
private
printing
press
of
the
chuff
organization
bearing
the
text
of
a
poster
which
was
found
broadcast
over
the
whole
country
a
few
days
later
it
ran
thus
at
the
next
election
for
perpetual
souse
vote
for
chuff
the
people
friend
the
end
