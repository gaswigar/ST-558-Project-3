printed
in
a
to
sandy
suicide
race
to
luna
the
four
men
had
been
scrutinized
watched
investigated
and
intensively
trained
for
more
than
a
year
they
were
the
best
men
to
be
found
for
that
first
flight
to
the
moon
the
pioneer
manned
rocket
that
would
give
either
the
east
or
the
west
control
over
the
earth
yet
when
the
race
started
adam
crag
found
that
he
had
a
saboteur
among
his
crew
a
traitor
such
a
man
could
give
the
reds
possession
of
luna
and
thereby
dominate
the
world
it
circled
any
one
of
the
other
three
could
be
the
hidden
enemy
and
if
he
did
discover
the
agent
soon
even
while
they
were
roaring
on
rocket
jets
through
outer
space
then
adam
crag
his
expedition
and
his
country
would
be
destroyed
prologue
one
of
the
rockets
was
silver
three
were
ashen
gray
each
nested
in
a
different
spot
on
the
great
western
desert
all
were
long
tapered
sisters
except
for
color
in
a
way
they
represented
the
first
and
last
of
an
era
with
exotic
propellants
a
high
mass
ratio
and
design
yet
they
were
not
quite
alike
one
of
the
sisters
had
within
her
the
artifacts
the
human
kind
needed
for
life
a
space
cabin
high
in
the
nose
the
remaining
sisters
were
drones
beasts
of
burden
but
beasts
which
carried
scant
payloads
considering
their
bulk
one
thing
they
had
in
common
destination
they
rested
on
their
launch
pads
with
scaffolds
almost
cleared
heads
high
and
proud
soon
they
would
flash
skyward
one
by
one
seeking
a
relatively
small
haven
on
a
strange
bleak
world
the
world
was
the
moon
the
bleak
place
was
called
arzachel
a
crater
stark
alien
with
tall
cliffs
brooding
over
an
ashy
plain
out
on
the
west
coast
a
successor
to
the
sisters
was
shaping
up
a
great
ship
of
a
new
age
with
nuclear
drive
and
a
single
stage
but
the
sisters
could
not
wait
for
their
successor
time
was
running
out
chapter
i
the
room
was
like
a
prison
at
least
to
adam
crag
it
was
a
square
with
a
narrow
bunk
a
battered
desk
two
chairs
and
little
else
its
one
small
window
overlooked
the
myriad
quonsets
and
buildings
of
burning
sands
base
from
the
second
floor
of
a
nearly
empty
dormitory
there
was
a
sentry
at
the
front
of
the
building
another
at
the
rear
silent
alert
men
who
never
spoke
to
crag
seldom
acknowledged
his
movements
to
and
from
the
building
yet
never
let
a
stranger
approach
the
weathered
dorm
without
sharp
challenge
night
and
day
they
were
there
from
his
window
he
could
see
the
distant
launch
site
and
by
night
the
batteries
of
floodlights
illumining
the
metal
monster
on
the
pad
but
now
he
was
thinking
of
the
rocket
he
was
fretting
fuming
because
of
a
call
from
colonel
michael
gotch
do
stir
from
the
room
gotch
had
crisply
ordered
on
the
phone
he
had
hung
up
without
explanation
that
had
been
two
hours
before
crag
had
finished
dressing
he
had
a
date
idly
wondering
what
was
in
the
colonel
mind
the
fretting
had
only
set
in
when
after
more
than
an
hour
gotch
had
failed
to
show
greg
liberty
had
been
restricted
to
one
night
a
month
one
measly
night
he
thought
now
he
was
wasting
it
tossing
away
the
precious
hours
waiting
waiting
for
what
i
a
slave
he
told
himself
viciously
slave
to
a
damned
bird
colonel
his
date
would
wait
was
the
waiting
kind
but
he
could
leave
he
stopped
pacing
long
enough
to
look
at
himself
in
the
cracked
mirror
above
his
desk
the
face
that
stared
back
was
lean
hard
unlined
skin
that
told
of
wind
and
sun
not
brown
nor
bronze
but
more
of
a
mahogany
red
just
now
the
face
was
frowning
the
eyes
were
hazel
the
nose
arrogant
and
hawkish
a
thin
white
scar
ran
over
one
cheek
ending
his
mind
registered
movement
behind
him
he
swiveled
around
flexing
his
body
balanced
on
his
toes
then
relaxed
slightly
mortified
gotch
colonel
michael
gotch
stood
just
inside
the
door
eyeing
him
tolerantly
a
flush
crept
over
crag
face
damn
gotch
and
his
velvet
feet
he
thought
but
he
kept
the
thought
concealed
the
expression
on
gotch
face
was
replaced
by
a
wooden
mask
he
studied
the
lean
man
by
the
mirror
for
a
moment
then
flipped
his
cap
on
the
bed
and
sat
down
without
switching
his
eyes
he
said
succinctly
you
it
i
got
it
crag
gave
an
audible
sigh
of
relief
gotch
nodded
without
speaking
what
about
temple
killed
last
night
flattened
by
a
truck
that
came
over
the
on
an
almost
deserted
highway
just
outside
the
base
gotch
added
he
spoke
casually
but
his
eyes
were
not
casual
they
were
unfathomable
black
pools
opaque
and
hard
crag
wrinkled
his
brow
inquiringly
accident
you
know
better
than
that
the
truck
was
hot
a
semi
with
bum
plates
and
no
driver
when
the
cops
got
there
his
voice
turned
harsh
no
it
was
no
accident
i
sorry
crag
said
quietly
he
had
known
temple
personally
he
had
been
just
a
name
a
whispered
name
one
of
three
names
to
be
exact
romer
temple
crag
each
had
been
as
possible
pilots
of
the
aztec
a
modified
missile
being
rushed
to
completion
in
a
last
ditch
effort
to
beat
the
eastern
world
in
the
race
for
the
moon
they
had
been
separately
indoctrinated
tested
trained
each
had
virtually
lived
in
one
of
the
simulators
of
the
aztec
space
cabin
and
had
been
rigorously
schooled
for
the
operation
secretly
referred
to
as
step
one
but
they
had
been
kept
carefully
apart
there
had
been
a
time
when
no
one
unless
it
were
the
gotch
knew
which
of
the
three
was
first
choice
romer
had
died
first
killed
as
a
bystander
in
a
brawl
so
the
police
said
crag
had
suspected
differently
now
temple
the
choice
after
all
had
not
been
the
swarthy
colonel
to
make
somehow
the
knowledge
pleased
him
gotch
interrupted
his
thoughts
things
are
happening
the
chips
are
down
time
has
run
out
adam
while
he
clipped
the
words
out
he
weighed
crag
as
if
seeking
some
clue
to
his
thoughts
his
face
said
that
everything
now
depended
upon
the
lean
man
with
the
hairline
scar
across
his
cheek
his
eyes
momentarily
wondered
if
the
lean
man
could
perform
what
man
never
before
had
done
but
his
lips
did
voice
the
doubt
after
a
moment
he
said
we
know
the
east
is
behind
us
in
developing
an
atomic
spaceship
quite
a
bit
behind
we
picked
up
a
lot
from
some
of
our
atomic
sub
work
that
and
our
big
missiles
but
maybe
the
knowledge
made
us
lax
he
added
stridently
now
they
ready
to
launch
now
now
i
did
think
they
were
that
close
intelligence
tells
us
they
modified
a
couple
of
the
big
icbm
model
we
just
got
a
line
on
it
almost
too
late
gotch
smiled
bleakly
so
we
jumped
our
schedule
at
great
risk
it
your
baby
he
added
crag
said
simply
i
glad
of
the
chance
you
should
be
you
hung
around
long
enough
gotch
said
dryly
his
eyes
probed
crag
i
only
hope
you
learned
enough
are
ready
plenty
ready
snapped
crag
i
hope
so
gotch
got
to
his
feet
a
square
fiftyish
man
with
cropped
hair
thick
shoulders
and
skin
clearly
he
was
a
desk
colonel
you
got
a
job
adam
his
voice
was
unexpectedly
soft
but
he
continued
to
weigh
crag
for
a
long
moment
before
he
picked
up
his
cap
and
turned
toward
the
door
wait
he
said
he
paused
listening
for
a
moment
before
he
opened
it
then
slipped
quietly
into
the
hall
closing
the
door
carefully
behind
him
he
like
a
cat
crag
thought
for
the
thousandth
time
watching
the
closed
door
he
was
a
man
who
seemed
forever
listening
a
heavy
hulking
man
who
walked
on
velvet
feet
a
man
with
opaque
eyes
who
saw
everything
and
told
nothing
gotch
would
return
despite
the
fact
the
grizzled
colonel
had
been
his
mentor
for
over
a
year
he
felt
he
hardly
knew
the
man
he
was
high
up
in
the
missile
program
missile
security
crag
had
supposed
yet
he
seemed
to
hold
power
far
greater
than
that
of
a
security
officer
he
seemed
in
fact
to
have
full
charge
of
the
aztec
project
step
one
even
though
kenneth
walmsbelt
was
its
official
director
the
difference
was
the
nation
knew
walmsbelt
he
talked
with
congressmen
pleaded
for
money
carried
his
program
to
the
newspapers
and
was
a
familiar
figure
on
the
country
tv
screens
he
was
the
leading
exponent
of
the
philosophy
but
few
people
knew
gotch
and
fewer
yet
his
connections
he
was
capable
competent
and
to
crag
way
of
thinking
a
tough
monkey
which
pretty
well
summarized
his
knowledge
of
the
man
he
felt
the
elation
welling
inside
him
growing
until
it
was
almost
a
painful
pleasure
it
had
been
born
of
months
and
months
of
hope
over
a
year
during
which
he
had
scarcely
dared
hope
now
because
a
man
had
died
he
sat
looking
at
the
ceiling
thinking
trying
to
still
the
inner
tumult
only
outwardly
was
he
calm
he
heard
footsteps
returning
gotch
opened
the
door
and
entered
followed
by
a
second
man
crag
started
involuntarily
from
his
chair
he
was
looking
at
himself
crag
meet
adam
crag
the
colonel
voice
and
face
were
expressionless
crag
extended
his
hand
feeling
a
little
silly
glad
to
know
you
the
newcomer
acknowledged
the
introduction
with
a
grin
the
same
kind
of
lopsided
grin
the
real
crag
wore
more
startling
was
the
selfsame
hairline
scar
traversing
his
cheek
the
same
touch
of
cockiness
in
the
set
of
his
face
gotch
said
i
just
wanted
you
to
get
a
good
look
at
yourself
crag
here
he
motioned
his
hand
toward
the
newcomer
is
your
official
double
what
were
you
planning
for
tonight
your
last
night
on
earth
i
have
a
date
with
ann
or
had
he
added
sourly
he
twisted
his
head
toward
gotch
as
the
colonel
words
sunk
home
last
night
gotch
disregarded
the
question
for
what
supper
and
dancing
at
the
blue
door
then
take
her
home
if
it
any
of
your
damned
business
snapped
crag
i
was
planning
on
staying
if
that
what
you
mean
i
know
i
know
we
have
you
on
a
chart
gotch
said
amiably
we
know
every
move
you
made
since
you
wet
your
first
diapers
like
that
curvy
little
brunette
secretary
out
in
san
diego
or
that
blonde
night
club
warbler
you
were
rushing
in
las
vegas
crag
flushed
the
colonel
eyed
him
tolerantly
and
plenty
more
he
added
he
glanced
at
crag
double
i
sure
your
twin
will
be
happy
to
fill
in
for
you
tonight
like
hell
he
will
gritted
crag
the
room
was
quiet
for
a
moment
as
i
said
he
fill
in
for
you
crag
grinned
crookedly
ann
wo
go
for
it
she
used
to
the
real
article
we
not
giving
her
a
chance
to
snafu
the
works
gotch
said
grimly
she
in
protective
custody
we
have
a
double
for
her
too
mind
explaining
not
a
bit
let
face
the
facts
and
admit
both
romer
and
temple
were
murdered
that
leaves
only
you
the
enemy
is
about
to
let
us
get
the
aztec
into
space
you
the
only
pilot
left
who
been
trained
for
the
big
jump
the
only
man
with
the
specialized
that
why
on
someone
list
perhaps
even
someone
here
at
the
base
or
on
the
highway
or
in
town
i
do
know
when
or
how
but
i
do
know
this
you
a
marked
monkey
gotch
added
flatly
i
do
propose
to
let
you
get
murdered
how
about
him
crag
nodded
toward
his
double
the
man
smiled
faintly
that
what
he
paid
for
gotch
said
unfeelingly
his
lips
curled
sardonically
all
the
heroes
are
in
space
crag
flushed
gotch
had
a
way
of
making
him
uncomfortable
as
no
other
man
ever
had
the
gentle
needle
but
it
was
true
the
aztec
was
his
baby
gotch
role
was
to
see
that
he
lived
long
enough
to
get
it
into
space
the
rest
was
up
to
him
something
about
the
situation
struck
him
as
humorous
he
looked
at
his
double
with
a
wry
grin
home
and
to
bed
early
he
cautioned
do
forget
you
got
my
reputation
to
uphold
go
to
hell
his
double
said
amiably
okay
let
get
down
to
business
gotch
growled
i
got
a
little
to
say
long
after
they
left
crag
stood
at
the
small
window
looking
out
over
the
desert
somewhere
out
there
was
the
aztec
a
silver
arrow
crouched
in
its
cradle
its
nose
pointed
toward
the
stars
he
drew
the
picture
in
his
mind
she
stood
on
her
tail
fins
a
needle
braced
by
metal
catwalks
and
guard
rails
a
cousin
to
the
great
nuclear
weapons
which
guarded
fortress
america
he
had
seen
her
at
night
under
the
batteries
of
floor
lights
agleam
with
a
milky
radiance
a
virgin
looking
skyward
which
in
fact
she
was
midway
along
her
length
her
diameter
tapered
abruptly
tapered
again
beyond
the
point
her
nose
looked
slender
compared
with
her
body
yet
it
contained
a
space
cabin
with
all
the
panoply
needed
to
sustain
life
beyond
the
atmosphere
his
thoughts
were
reverent
if
not
loving
save
for
occasional
intervals
with
ann
the
ship
had
dominated
his
life
for
over
a
year
he
knew
her
more
intimately
he
thought
than
a
man
knows
his
wife
he
had
never
ceased
to
marvel
at
the
aztec
complexity
everything
about
the
rocket
spoke
of
the
future
she
was
clearly
designed
to
perform
in
a
time
not
yet
come
at
a
place
not
yet
known
she
would
fly
watching
the
stars
continuously
measuring
the
angle
between
them
computing
her
way
through
the
abyss
of
space
like
a
woman
she
would
understand
the
deep
currents
within
her
the
introspective
sensing
of
every
force
which
had
an
effect
upon
her
life
she
would
measure
gravitation
acceleration
and
angular
velocity
with
infinite
precision
she
would
count
these
as
units
of
time
perform
complex
mathematical
equations
translate
them
into
course
data
and
find
her
way
unerringly
across
the
night
which
separated
her
from
her
assignation
with
destiny
she
would
move
with
the
certainty
of
a
woman
fleeing
to
her
lover
yes
he
thought
he
would
put
his
life
in
the
lady
hands
he
would
ride
with
her
on
swift
wings
but
he
would
be
her
master
his
mood
changed
he
turned
from
the
window
thinking
it
was
a
hell
of
a
way
to
spend
his
last
night
last
night
on
earth
he
corrected
wryly
he
could
leave
the
room
could
budge
did
know
where
ann
was
no
telephone
he
went
to
bed
wondering
how
he
ever
let
himself
get
snookered
into
the
deal
here
he
was
young
with
a
zest
for
life
and
a
gal
on
the
string
and
what
was
he
doing
about
it
going
to
the
moon
that
what
going
to
some
damned
called
arzachel
all
because
a
smooth
bird
colonel
had
pitched
him
a
few
soft
words
sucker
his
lips
twisted
in
a
crooked
grin
gotch
had
seduced
him
by
describing
his
mission
as
an
opportunity
those
had
been
gotch
words
well
that
was
arzachel
and
pretty
quick
it
would
be
adam
crag
crag
just
now
the
thought
was
so
appealing
sleep
did
come
easy
at
gotch
orders
he
had
turned
in
early
at
the
unheard
hour
of
seven
getting
to
sleep
was
another
matter
strange
he
thought
he
did
have
any
of
the
feelings
doc
weldon
the
psychiatrist
had
warned
him
of
he
was
nervous
was
afraid
yet
before
another
sun
had
set
he
be
driving
the
aztec
up
from
earth
into
the
loneliness
of
space
to
a
bleak
crater
named
arzachel
he
would
face
the
dangers
of
intense
cosmic
radiation
chance
meteor
swarms
and
human
errors
in
calculation
which
could
spell
disaster
it
would
be
the
first
step
in
the
world
race
for
control
of
the
solar
system
a
crucial
race
with
the
small
nations
of
the
world
watching
for
the
winner
watching
and
waiting
to
see
which
way
to
lean
he
was
already
cut
off
from
mankind
imprisoned
in
a
small
room
with
the
momentous
zero
hour
drawing
steadily
nearer
strange
he
thought
there
had
been
a
time
when
his
career
had
seemed
ended
washed
up
finished
the
magic
of
the
stratosphere
behind
him
for
good
sure
resigned
from
the
air
force
at
his
own
free
will
even
if
his
had
made
the
pointed
suggestion
because
he
had
blindly
followed
orders
because
he
believed
in
making
his
own
decisions
when
the
chips
were
down
lack
of
de
his
had
termed
it
he
been
surprised
that
night
it
was
over
a
year
ago
now
that
colonel
gotch
had
contacted
him
just
when
he
was
wondering
where
he
might
get
a
job
he
had
liked
the
prosaic
prospects
of
pushing
passengers
around
the
country
in
some
jet
job
sure
he
jumped
at
the
offer
but
the
question
had
never
left
his
mind
had
gotch
selected
him
the
aztec
a
silver
needle
plunging
through
space
followed
by
her
drones
all
in
his
tender
care
he
was
planning
the
procedure
of
when
sleep
came
chapter
crag
woke
with
a
start
sensing
he
was
not
alone
the
sound
came
again
a
key
being
fitted
into
a
lock
he
started
from
bed
as
the
door
swung
open
easy
it
me
gotch
crag
relaxed
a
square
solid
figure
took
form
do
turn
on
the
light
okay
what
gives
one
moment
gotch
turned
back
toward
the
door
and
beckoned
another
figure
glided
into
the
room
a
shadow
in
the
dim
light
crag
caught
the
glint
of
a
uniform
air
force
officer
he
thought
gotch
said
crisply
out
of
bed
he
climbed
out
standing
alongside
the
bed
in
his
shorts
wondering
at
the
colonel
approach
okay
major
it
your
turn
gotch
said
the
newcomer
crag
saw
he
was
a
major
methodically
stripped
down
to
his
shorts
and
got
into
bed
without
a
word
crag
grinned
wondering
how
the
major
liked
his
part
in
step
one
it
was
scarcely
a
lead
role
gotch
cut
into
his
thoughts
get
dressed
he
indicated
the
uniform
crag
donned
the
garments
silently
when
he
had
finished
the
colonel
walked
around
him
in
the
dark
studying
him
from
all
angles
seems
to
fit
very
well
he
said
finally
all
right
let
go
crag
followed
him
from
the
room
wondering
what
the
unknown
major
must
be
thinking
he
wanted
to
ask
about
his
double
but
refrained
long
ago
he
had
learned
there
was
a
time
to
talk
and
a
time
to
keep
quiet
this
was
the
quiet
time
at
the
outer
door
four
soldiers
sprang
from
the
darkness
and
boxed
them
in
a
chauffeur
jumped
from
a
waiting
car
and
opened
the
rear
door
at
the
last
moment
crag
stepped
aside
and
made
a
mock
bow
after
you
colonel
his
voice
held
a
touch
of
sarcasm
gotch
grunted
and
climbed
into
the
rear
seat
and
he
followed
the
chauffeur
blinked
his
lights
twice
before
starting
the
engine
somewhere
ahead
a
car
pulled
away
from
the
curb
they
followed
leaving
the
four
soldiers
behind
crag
twisted
his
body
and
looked
curiously
out
the
rear
window
another
car
dogged
their
wake
precautions
always
precautions
he
thought
gotch
had
entered
with
an
air
force
officer
and
had
ostensibly
left
with
one
ergo
it
must
be
the
same
officer
he
chuckled
thinking
he
had
more
doubles
than
a
movie
star
they
sped
through
the
night
with
the
escorts
fore
and
aft
gotch
was
a
silent
hulking
form
on
the
seat
beside
him
it
his
zero
hour
too
crag
thought
the
colonel
had
tossed
the
dice
now
he
was
waiting
for
their
fall
with
his
career
in
the
pot
after
a
while
gotch
said
conversationally
you
report
in
at
albrook
major
i
imagine
you
be
getting
in
a
bit
of
flying
from
here
on
out
talking
for
the
chauffeur
benefit
crag
thought
good
lord
did
every
move
have
to
be
cloak
and
dagger
aloud
he
said
be
good
to
get
back
in
the
air
again
perhaps
patrol
eh
very
likely
they
fell
silent
again
the
car
skimmed
west
on
highway
leaving
the
silver
rocket
farther
behind
with
every
mile
where
to
and
what
next
he
gave
up
trying
to
figure
the
colonel
strategy
one
thing
he
was
sure
of
the
man
next
to
him
knew
exactly
what
he
was
doing
if
it
was
secret
agent
stuff
then
that
the
way
it
had
to
be
played
he
leaned
back
and
thought
of
the
task
ahead
the
rocket
he
had
lived
with
for
over
a
year
now
the
marriage
would
be
consummated
every
detail
of
the
aztec
was
vivid
in
his
mind
like
the
three
great
motors
tucked
triangularly
between
her
tail
fins
each
a
tank
equipped
with
a
flaring
nozzle
to
feed
in
hot
gases
under
pressure
he
pictured
the
fuel
tanks
just
forward
of
the
engines
the
way
the
fuels
were
mixed
vaporized
forced
into
the
fireports
where
they
would
ignite
and
react
explosively
generating
the
enormous
volumes
of
flaming
hot
gas
to
drive
out
through
the
jet
tubes
and
provide
the
tremendous
thrust
needed
to
boost
her
into
the
skies
between
the
engines
and
fuel
tanks
was
a
maze
of
machinery
fuel
lines
speed
controllers
electric
motors
he
let
his
mind
rove
over
the
rocket
thinking
that
before
many
hours
had
passed
he
would
need
every
morsel
of
the
knowledge
he
had
so
carefully
gathered
midway
where
the
hull
tapered
was
a
joint
the
separation
point
between
the
first
and
second
stages
the
second
stage
had
one
engine
fed
by
two
tanks
the
exterior
of
the
second
stage
was
smooth
finless
for
it
was
designed
to
operate
at
the
fringe
of
space
where
the
air
molecules
were
widely
spaced
but
it
could
be
steered
by
small
deflectors
mounted
in
its
blast
stream
the
third
stage
was
little
more
than
a
space
cabin
riding
between
the
tapered
nose
cone
and
a
single
relatively
engine
between
the
engine
and
tanks
was
a
maze
of
turbines
pumps
meters
motors
wires
a
generator
provided
electricity
for
the
ship
electric
and
electronic
equipment
this
in
turn
was
spun
by
a
turbine
driven
by
the
explosive
decomposition
of
hydrogen
peroxide
forward
of
this
was
the
brain
a
complex
guidance
mechanism
which
monitored
engine
performance
kept
track
of
speed
computed
course
all
that
was
needed
was
the
human
hand
his
hand
they
traveled
several
hours
with
only
occasional
words
purring
across
the
flat
sandy
wastes
at
a
steady
seventy
the
cars
boxing
them
in
kept
at
a
steady
distance
crag
watched
the
yellow
headlights
sweep
across
the
sage
lining
the
highway
giving
an
odd
illusion
of
movement
light
and
shadow
danced
in
eerie
patterns
the
chauffeur
turned
onto
a
road
heading
north
alpine
base
crag
thought
he
had
been
stationed
there
several
years
before
now
it
was
reputed
to
be
the
launch
site
of
one
of
the
three
drones
slated
to
cross
the
gulfs
of
space
the
chauffeur
drove
past
a
housing
area
and
turned
in
the
direction
he
knew
the
strip
to
be
somewhere
in
the
darkness
ahead
a
drone
brooded
on
its
pad
one
of
the
children
of
the
silver
missile
they
left
behind
but
why
the
drone
the
question
bothered
him
they
were
stopped
several
times
in
the
next
half
mile
each
time
gotch
gave
his
name
and
rank
and
extended
his
credentials
each
time
they
were
waved
on
by
silent
sentries
but
only
after
an
exacting
scrutiny
crag
was
groping
for
answers
when
the
chauffeur
pulled
to
one
side
of
the
road
and
stopped
he
leaped
out
and
opened
the
rear
door
standing
silently
to
one
side
when
they
emerged
he
got
back
into
the
car
and
drove
away
no
word
had
been
spoken
figures
moved
toward
them
coming
out
of
the
blackness
stand
where
you
are
and
be
recognized
the
figures
took
shape
soldiers
with
leveled
rifles
they
stood
very
still
until
one
wearing
a
captain
bars
approached
flashing
a
light
in
their
faces
identity
crag
companion
extended
his
credentials
colonel
michael
gotch
he
monotoned
the
captain
turned
the
light
on
gotch
face
to
compare
it
with
the
picture
on
the
identification
card
he
paid
scant
attention
to
crag
finally
he
looked
up
proceed
sir
it
was
evident
the
colonel
guest
was
very
much
expected
gotch
struck
off
through
the
darkness
with
crag
at
his
heels
the
stars
shone
with
icy
brilliance
overhead
antares
stared
down
from
its
lair
in
scorpio
blinking
with
fearful
venom
the
smell
of
sage
filled
the
air
and
some
sweet
elusive
odor
crag
could
identify
a
warmth
stole
upward
as
the
furnace
of
the
desert
gave
up
its
stored
heat
he
strained
his
eyes
into
the
darkness
stars
the
black
desert
and
the
hulking
form
of
gotch
moving
with
certain
steps
he
saw
the
rocket
with
startling
suddenness
a
great
black
silhouette
blotting
out
a
segment
of
the
stars
it
stood
gigantic
towering
graceful
a
monster
crouched
to
spring
its
finned
haunches
squatted
against
the
launch
pad
they
were
stopped
challenged
allowed
to
proceed
crag
pondered
the
reason
for
their
visit
to
the
drone
gotch
he
knew
had
a
good
reason
for
every
move
he
made
they
drew
nearer
and
he
saw
that
most
of
the
catwalks
guardrails
and
metal
supports
had
been
removed
a
certain
sign
that
the
giant
before
them
was
near
its
zero
hour
another
sentry
gave
challenge
at
the
base
of
the
behemoth
crag
whistled
to
himself
this
one
wore
the
silver
leaf
of
a
lieutenant
colonel
the
ritual
of
identification
was
exacting
before
the
sentry
moved
aside
a
ladder
zigzagged
upward
through
what
skeletal
framework
still
remained
crag
lifted
his
eyes
it
terminated
high
up
near
the
nose
this
was
the
aztec
the
real
aztec
the
truth
came
in
a
rush
the
huge
silver
ship
at
burning
sands
which
bore
the
name
aztec
was
merely
a
fake
a
subterfuge
a
pawn
in
the
complex
game
of
agents
and
he
knew
he
was
right
after
you
gotch
said
he
indicated
the
ladder
and
stepped
aside
crag
started
up
he
paused
at
the
third
platform
the
floor
of
the
desert
was
a
sea
of
darkness
off
in
the
distance
the
lights
of
alpine
base
gleamed
stark
against
the
night
gotch
reached
his
level
and
laid
a
restraining
hand
on
his
arm
crag
turned
and
waited
the
colonel
massive
form
was
a
black
shadow
interposed
between
him
and
the
lights
of
alpine
base
this
is
the
aztec
he
said
simply
so
i
guessed
and
the
silver
job
at
burning
sands
drone
able
gotch
explained
the
deception
was
necessary
a
part
of
the
cat
and
mouse
game
we
been
playing
the
last
couple
of
decades
we
could
take
a
single
chance
crag
remained
silent
the
colonel
turned
toward
the
lights
of
the
base
he
had
become
quiet
reflective
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
soft
almost
like
a
man
talking
to
himself
out
there
are
hundreds
of
men
who
have
given
a
large
part
of
their
lives
to
the
dream
of
space
flight
now
we
are
at
the
eve
of
making
that
dream
live
if
we
gain
the
moon
we
gain
the
planets
that
the
destiny
of
man
the
aztec
is
the
first
step
he
turned
back
and
faced
crag
this
is
but
one
base
there
are
many
others
beyond
them
are
the
factories
laboratories
colleges
scientists
and
engineers
right
down
to
joe
the
riveter
every
one
of
them
has
had
a
part
in
the
dream
you
another
part
adam
but
you
happen
to
have
the
lead
role
he
swiveled
around
and
looked
silently
at
the
distant
lights
the
moment
was
solemn
a
slight
shiver
ran
through
crag
body
you
know
and
i
know
that
the
aztec
is
a
development
from
the
guarding
fortress
america
you
also
know
or
have
heard
that
out
in
san
diego
the
first
spaceship
is
nearing
completion
he
looked
sharply
at
crag
i
heard
crag
said
noncommittally
gotch
eyed
him
steadily
that
the
point
so
have
others
our
space
program
is
no
secret
but
we
suspected
feared
that
the
first
stab
at
deep
space
would
be
made
before
the
atom
job
was
completed
not
satellites
but
deep
space
rockets
that
why
the
aztec
was
pushed
through
so
fast
he
fell
silent
crag
waited
well
the
worst
has
happened
the
enemy
is
ready
to
launch
may
have
launched
this
very
night
that
how
close
it
is
fortunately
our
gamble
with
the
aztec
is
paying
off
we
ready
too
adam
we
going
to
get
that
moon
get
it
now
he
reached
into
a
pocket
and
extracted
his
pipe
then
thought
better
of
lighting
it
crag
waited
the
colonel
was
in
a
rare
introspective
mood
a
quiet
moment
in
which
he
mentally
tied
together
and
weighed
his
nation
prospects
in
the
frightening
days
ahead
finally
he
spoke
we
put
a
rocket
around
the
moon
adam
he
smiled
faintly
noting
crag
involuntary
start
of
surprise
naturally
it
was
fully
instrumented
there
uranium
there
one
big
load
located
in
the
most
inaccessible
spot
imaginable
arzachel
crag
said
simply
the
south
side
of
arzachel
to
be
exact
that
why
we
did
pick
a
soft
touch
like
mare
imbrium
in
case
you
wondered
i
wondered
adam
the
colonel
hesitated
a
long
moment
does
the
name
pickering
mean
anything
to
you
ken
pickering
who
what
have
you
heard
snapped
gotch
his
eyes
became
sharp
drills
crag
spoke
slowly
nothing
for
a
long
time
he
just
seemed
to
drop
out
of
sight
after
he
broke
the
altitude
record
in
the
he
looked
up
questioningly
frankly
i
always
wondered
why
he
had
been
selected
for
this
job
i
thought
he
was
a
better
pilot
than
i
am
he
added
almost
humbly
gotch
said
bluntly
you
right
he
is
better
he
smiled
tolerantly
we
picked
our
men
for
particular
jobs
he
said
finally
pickering
we
hope
will
be
in
orbit
before
the
aztec
blasts
off
satelloid
the
first
true
satelloid
the
colonel
agreed
one
that
can
ride
the
fringes
of
space
around
the
earth
a
satelloid
with
fantastic
altitude
and
speed
i
telling
you
this
because
he
be
a
link
in
step
one
a
communication
and
observation
link
he
wo
be
up
long
of
course
but
long
enough
we
hope
silence
fell
between
them
crag
looked
past
the
colonel
shoulder
all
at
once
the
lights
of
alpine
base
seemed
warm
and
near
almost
personal
gotch
lifted
his
eyes
skyward
symbolic
of
his
dreams
the
light
of
distant
stars
reflected
off
his
brow
we
do
know
whether
the
aztec
can
make
it
he
said
humbly
we
do
know
whether
our
system
will
work
whether
the
drones
can
be
monitored
down
to
such
a
precise
point
on
the
moon
or
the
dangers
of
meteorite
bombardment
we
do
know
whether
our
safeguards
for
human
life
are
adequate
we
do
know
whether
the
opposition
can
stop
us
we
do
know
lots
of
things
adam
all
we
know
is
that
we
need
the
moon
it
a
matter
of
survival
of
western
man
his
culture
his
way
of
life
his
political
integrity
we
need
the
moon
to
conquer
the
planets
and
some
day
the
stars
his
voice
became
a
harsh
clang
so
does
the
enemy
that
why
we
have
to
establish
a
proprietory
ownership
a
claim
that
the
will
recognize
the
little
nations
represent
the
balance
of
power
adam
but
they
sway
with
the
political
winds
they
are
the
reeds
of
power
politics
swaying
between
the
sputniks
and
explorers
riding
with
the
ebb
and
flow
of
power
always
trying
to
anticipate
the
ultimate
winner
right
now
they
watching
to
see
where
that
power
lies
the
nation
that
wins
the
moon
will
tilt
the
balance
in
its
favor
at
a
critical
time
i
might
add
that
why
we
have
to
protect
ourselves
every
inch
of
the
way
he
tapped
his
cold
pipe
moodily
against
his
hand
we
wo
be
here
to
see
the
end
results
of
course
that
wo
be
in
our
time
but
we
the
starters
the
aztec
is
the
pioneer
ship
and
in
the
future
our
economy
can
use
that
load
of
uranium
up
there
he
smiled
faintly
at
crag
when
you
step
through
the
hatch
you
left
earth
perhaps
for
all
time
that
your
part
in
the
plan
step
one
is
your
baby
and
i
have
confidence
in
you
he
gripped
crag
arm
warmly
it
was
the
closest
he
had
ever
come
to
showing
his
feelings
toward
the
man
he
was
sending
into
space
come
on
let
go
crag
started
upward
gotch
followed
more
slowly
climbing
like
a
man
bearing
a
heavy
weight
the
aztec
crew
max
prochaska
gordon
nagel
and
martin
larkwell
came
aboard
the
rocket
in
the
last
hour
before
gotch
escorted
them
up
the
ladder
and
introduced
them
to
their
new
commander
prochaska
acknowledged
the
introduction
with
a
cheerful
smile
glad
to
know
you
skipper
his
thin
warm
face
said
he
was
glad
to
be
there
gordon
nagel
gave
a
perfunctory
handshake
taking
in
the
space
cabin
with
quick
head
movements
martin
larkwell
smiled
genially
pumping
crag
hand
i
been
looking
forward
to
this
crag
said
dryly
we
all
have
he
acknowledged
the
introductions
with
the
distinct
feeling
that
he
already
knew
each
member
of
his
crew
it
was
the
odd
feeling
of
meeting
old
acquaintances
after
long
years
of
separation
as
part
of
his
indoctrination
he
had
studied
the
personnel
records
of
the
men
he
might
be
so
dependent
on
now
seeing
them
in
the
flesh
was
merely
an
act
of
giving
life
to
those
selfsame
records
he
studied
them
with
casual
eyes
while
gotch
rambled
toward
an
awkward
farewell
max
prochaska
his
electronics
chief
was
a
slender
man
with
sparse
brown
hair
a
thin
acquiline
nose
and
pointed
jaw
his
pale
blue
eyes
thin
lips
and
alabaster
skin
gave
him
a
delicate
look
one
belied
by
his
record
his
chief
asset
if
one
was
to
believe
the
record
was
that
he
was
a
genius
in
electronics
gordon
nagel
too
was
and
pallid
skinned
his
black
hair
normally
long
and
wavy
had
been
his
eyes
were
small
shifting
giving
crag
the
feeling
that
he
was
uneasy
an
impression
he
was
to
hold
his
record
had
described
him
as
nervous
in
manner
but
his
psychograph
was
smooth
he
was
an
expert
in
oxygen
systems
martin
larkwell
the
mechanical
maintenance
and
construction
boss
in
many
ways
appeared
the
antithesis
of
his
two
companions
he
was
dark
with
short
brown
hair
and
a
deceptively
sleepy
look
his
round
body
was
his
hands
big
and
square
crag
thought
of
a
sleek
drowsy
cat
until
he
saw
his
eyes
they
were
sparkling
brown
pools
glittering
moving
with
some
strange
inner
fire
they
were
the
eyes
of
a
dreamer
or
a
fanatic
he
thought
in
the
cabin
soft
light
they
glowed
flickered
no
there
was
nothing
sleepy
about
him
he
decided
all
of
the
men
were
short
light
in
their
early
thirties
in
contrast
crag
at
and
pounds
seemed
a
veritable
giant
a
small
physique
he
knew
was
almost
an
essential
in
space
where
every
ounce
was
bought
at
tremendous
added
weight
in
fuel
his
own
weight
had
been
a
serious
strike
against
him
colonel
gotch
made
one
final
trip
to
the
space
cabin
this
time
he
brought
the
code
stamped
top
secret
the
crew
personnel
records
crag
wondered
why
and
a
newly
printed
pamphlet
titled
moon
survival
crag
grinned
when
he
saw
it
does
it
tell
us
how
to
get
there
too
we
write
that
chapter
later
gotch
grunted
he
shook
each
hand
and
gruffly
wished
them
luck
before
turning
abruptly
toward
the
hatch
he
started
down
the
ladder
a
moment
later
his
head
reappeared
he
looked
sharply
at
crag
and
said
by
the
way
that
twosome
at
the
blue
door
got
it
last
night
you
mean
burp
gun
no
finesse
just
sheer
desperation
well
i
just
wanted
to
let
you
know
we
were
altogether
crazy
i
did
think
you
were
the
colonel
lips
wrinkled
in
a
curious
smile
no
he
looked
at
crag
for
a
long
moment
good
luck
his
head
disappeared
from
view
and
crag
heard
his
footsteps
descending
the
ladder
then
they
were
alone
four
men
alone
crag
turned
toward
his
companions
chapter
the
great
red
sun
was
just
breaking
over
the
desert
horizon
when
crag
got
his
last
good
look
at
earth
its
rays
slanted
upward
shadows
fled
from
the
sage
the
obsidian
sky
with
its
strewn
diamonds
became
slate
gray
and
in
moments
a
pale
washed
blue
daybreak
over
the
desert
became
a
thunder
of
light
tiny
ants
had
removed
the
last
of
the
metal
framework
encompassing
the
rocket
other
ants
were
visible
making
last
minute
cheeks
he
returned
his
attention
to
the
space
cabin
despite
long
months
of
training
in
the
cabin
simulator
an
exact
replica
of
the
aztec
quarters
he
was
appalled
at
the
lack
of
outside
vision
one
narrow
rectangular
quartz
window
above
the
control
panel
a
circular
port
on
each
side
bulkhead
and
one
on
the
floor
he
had
to
look
between
his
knees
to
see
through
it
when
seated
at
the
controls
provided
the
sole
visual
access
to
the
outside
world
a
single
large
radarscope
a
radar
altimeter
and
other
electronic
equipment
provided
analogs
of
the
outside
world
the
reconstruction
of
the
exterior
environment
painted
on
the
scopes
by
electromagnetic
impulses
the
cabin
was
little
more
than
a
long
cylinder
with
most
of
the
instrumentation
in
the
nose
section
with
the
rocket
in
launch
position
what
normally
was
the
rear
wall
formed
the
floor
the
seats
had
been
swiveled
out
to
operational
position
now
they
were
seated
strapped
down
waiting
it
was
crag
thought
like
sitting
in
a
large
automobile
which
had
been
balanced
on
its
rear
bumper
during
launch
and
climb
their
backs
would
be
horizontal
to
the
earth
surface
he
was
thankful
they
were
not
required
to
wear
their
heavy
pressure
suits
until
well
into
the
moon
gravisphere
normally
pressure
suits
and
helmets
were
the
order
of
the
day
he
was
used
to
stratospheric
flight
where
heavy
pressure
suits
and
helmets
were
standard
equipment
gear
to
protect
the
fragile
human
form
until
the
lower
regions
of
the
air
ocean
could
be
reached
in
event
of
trouble
but
the
aztec
was
an
affair
there
were
no
escape
provisions
no
ejection
seats
for
ejection
would
be
impossible
at
the
rocket
speeds
during
its
critical
climb
through
the
atmosphere
either
everything
went
according
to
the
book
or
or
else
he
concluded
grimly
but
it
had
one
good
aspect
aside
from
the
heavy
safety
harnessing
he
would
be
free
of
the
intolerably
clumsy
suit
until
moonfall
if
anything
went
wrong
well
he
bit
the
thought
off
feeling
the
tension
building
inside
him
he
had
never
considered
himself
the
hero
type
he
had
prided
himself
that
his
ability
to
handle
hot
planes
was
a
reflection
of
his
competence
rather
than
courage
courage
to
him
meant
capable
performance
in
the
face
of
fear
he
had
never
known
fear
in
any
type
of
aircraft
hence
never
before
had
courage
been
a
requisite
of
his
job
it
was
that
simple
to
him
his
thorough
knowledge
of
the
aztec
theoretical
flight
characteristics
had
given
him
extreme
confidence
thus
the
feeling
of
tension
was
distracting
he
held
his
hand
out
it
seemed
steady
enough
prochaska
caught
the
gesture
and
said
i
a
little
shaky
myself
crag
grinned
they
tell
me
the
first
thousand
miles
are
the
hardest
amen
after
that
i
wo
worry
the
countdown
had
begun
crag
looked
out
the
side
port
tiny
figures
were
withdrawing
from
the
base
of
the
rocket
the
engine
of
a
fuel
truck
sounded
faintly
then
died
away
everything
seemed
unhurried
routine
he
found
himself
admiring
the
men
who
went
so
about
the
job
of
hurling
a
rocket
into
the
gulfs
between
planets
once
during
his
indoctrination
he
had
watched
a
thor
firing
had
seen
the
missile
climb
into
the
sky
building
up
to
orbital
speed
its
launchers
had
been
the
same
sort
of
men
unhurried
methodical
checking
the
minutiae
that
went
into
such
an
effort
only
this
time
there
was
a
difference
the
missile
contained
men
off
to
one
side
he
saw
the
launch
crew
moving
into
an
instrumented
dugout
colonel
gotch
would
be
there
puffing
on
his
pipe
his
face
expressionless
watching
the
work
of
many
years
come
to
what
he
looked
around
the
cabin
for
the
hundredth
time
larkwell
and
nagel
were
strapped
in
their
seats
backs
horizontal
to
the
floor
looking
up
at
him
the
tremendous
forces
of
acceleration
applied
at
right
angles
to
the
spine
transverse
g
was
far
more
tolerable
than
in
any
other
position
or
so
the
space
medicine
men
said
he
hoped
they
were
right
that
in
this
position
the
body
could
withstand
the
hell
ahead
he
gave
a
last
look
at
the
two
men
behind
him
larkwell
wore
an
owlish
expression
his
teeth
were
clamped
tight
cording
his
jaws
nagel
face
was
intent
its
lines
rigid
it
gave
crag
the
odd
impression
of
an
alabaster
sculpture
prochaska
who
occupied
the
seat
next
to
him
facing
the
control
panels
was
testing
his
safety
belts
crag
gave
him
a
quick
sidelong
glance
prochaska
job
was
in
many
respects
as
difficult
as
his
own
perhaps
more
so
the
electronics
chief
bore
the
responsibility
of
monitoring
the
drones
shepherding
first
drone
able
then
its
sisters
to
follow
across
the
vacuum
gulfs
and
finally
into
arzachel
a
pinpoint
cavity
in
the
rocky
wastelands
of
the
moon
in
addition
he
was
charged
with
monitoring
repairing
and
installing
all
the
communication
and
electronic
equipment
no
small
job
in
itself
yes
a
lot
depended
on
the
almost
fragile
man
sitting
alongside
him
he
looked
at
his
own
harnessing
testing
its
fit
colonel
gotch
came
on
the
communicator
pickering
in
orbit
he
said
briefly
no
details
yet
crag
sighed
in
relief
somehow
pickering
success
augured
well
for
their
own
attempt
he
gave
a
last
check
of
the
communication
gear
the
main
speaker
was
set
just
above
the
instrument
panel
between
him
and
prochaska
in
addition
both
he
and
the
chief
the
title
he
had
conferred
on
prochaska
as
his
special
assistant
were
supplied
with
insert
earphones
and
lip
microphones
for
use
during
high
noise
spectrums
or
when
privacy
was
desired
crag
as
commander
could
limit
all
communications
to
his
own
personal
headgear
by
merely
flipping
a
switch
gotch
had
been
the
architect
of
that
one
he
was
a
man
who
liked
private
lines
five
minutes
to
zero
commander
commander
crag
liked
that
he
struggled
against
his
harnessing
to
glance
back
over
his
shoulder
nagel
body
scrunched
deep
into
his
bucket
seat
seemed
pitifully
thin
under
the
heavy
harnessing
his
face
was
bloodless
taut
crag
momentarily
wondered
what
strange
course
of
events
had
brought
him
to
the
rocket
he
did
look
like
crag
picture
of
a
spaceman
not
at
all
but
then
none
of
them
looked
like
supermen
still
courage
was
a
matter
of
looks
he
told
himself
it
was
a
matter
of
action
he
swiveled
his
head
around
farther
larkwell
reclined
next
to
nagel
with
eyes
closed
only
the
fast
rise
and
fall
of
his
chest
told
of
his
inner
tensions
that
and
the
grip
of
his
fingers
around
the
arm
rests
worried
crag
thought
but
we
all
worried
he
cast
a
sidelong
glance
at
prochaska
the
man
face
held
enormous
calm
he
reached
over
and
picked
up
the
console
mike
then
sat
for
what
seemed
an
eternity
before
the
countdown
reached
minus
one
minute
he
plugged
in
his
microphone
thirty
seconds
the
voice
over
the
speaker
boomed
prochaska
suddenly
became
busy
checking
his
instruments
jittery
despite
his
seeming
calm
crag
thought
twenty
seconds
he
caught
himself
checking
his
controls
as
if
he
could
gain
some
last
moment
knowledge
from
the
banks
of
levers
and
dials
and
knobs
ten
nine
eight
he
experimentally
pulled
at
his
harnessing
feeling
somewhat
hypnotized
by
the
magic
of
the
numbers
coming
over
the
communicator
three
two
crag
said
ready
on
one
he
punched
a
button
a
muted
roar
drifted
up
from
the
stem
he
listened
for
a
moment
satisfied
he
moved
the
switch
the
roar
increased
becoming
almost
deafening
in
the
cabin
despite
its
soundproofing
he
tested
the
radio
and
steering
rockets
and
gave
a
last
sidelong
glance
at
prochaska
the
chief
winked
the
act
made
him
feel
better
i
should
be
nervous
he
thought
or
just
plain
damned
scared
but
things
were
happening
too
fast
he
adjusted
his
lip
mike
and
reached
for
the
controls
studying
his
hand
as
he
did
so
still
steady
he
stirred
the
controls
a
bit
and
the
roar
became
hellish
he
chewed
his
lip
and
took
a
deep
breath
exhaling
slowly
he
said
off
to
the
moon
prochaska
nodded
crag
moved
the
controls
the
cabin
seemed
to
bob
wobble
vibrate
a
high
hum
came
from
somewhere
he
glanced
downward
through
the
side
port
the
aztec
seemed
to
be
hanging
in
just
above
the
desert
floor
off
to
one
side
he
could
see
the
concrete
controls
dugout
the
tiny
figures
had
vanished
he
thought
is
sweating
it
out
in
the
past
rockets
had
burned
on
the
pad
blown
up
in
plunged
off
course
and
had
to
be
destroyed
the
idea
brought
his
head
up
with
a
snap
was
there
a
safety
officer
down
there
with
a
finger
on
a
button
prepared
to
destroy
the
aztec
if
it
wavered
in
flight
he
cut
the
thought
off
and
moved
the
main
power
switch
bringing
the
control
full
over
the
ship
bucked
and
the
desert
dropped
away
with
a
suddenness
that
brought
a
siege
of
nausea
he
tightened
his
stomach
muscles
like
the
space
medicine
doctors
had
instructed
the
first
moment
was
bad
there
was
unbelievable
thunder
a
fraction
of
a
second
when
his
brain
seemed
to
blank
a
quick
surge
of
fear
up
up
the
aztec
rate
of
acceleration
climbed
sharply
at
a
prescribed
point
in
time
the
nose
of
the
rocket
moved
slightly
toward
the
east
it
climbed
at
an
impossibly
steep
slant
rushing
up
from
the
earth
crag
swept
his
eyes
over
the
banks
of
instruments
noted
the
positions
of
the
controls
tried
to
follow
what
the
faint
voice
in
his
earphone
was
telling
him
dials
with
wavering
needles
knobs
with
blurry
numerals
a
cacophony
of
noise
light
and
movement
all
this
and
more
was
crowded
into
seconds
the
rocket
hurtled
upward
driven
by
the
tidal
kinetic
energy
generated
by
the
combustion
of
high
velocity
exhaust
born
in
an
inferno
of
thousands
of
degrees
behind
him
giant
thrust
chambers
hungrily
consumed
the
volatile
fuel
spewing
the
gases
forth
at
more
than
nine
thousand
miles
per
hour
the
crushing
increased
driving
him
against
the
back
of
his
seat
his
heart
began
laboring
became
a
sledge
hammer
inside
his
chest
wall
he
lost
all
sense
of
motion
only
the
almost
unendurable
weight
crushing
his
body
downward
mattered
he
managed
a
glimpse
of
the
desert
through
the
side
port
it
lay
far
below
its
salient
details
erased
the
roar
of
the
giant
motors
became
muted
there
was
a
singing
in
his
ears
a
high
whine
he
did
like
the
aztec
began
to
tilt
falling
off
to
the
right
he
cast
a
quick
glance
at
the
engine
instruments
a
red
light
blinked
number
three
was
delivering
slightly
less
thrust
than
the
others
somewhere
in
the
complex
of
machinery
a
mechanical
sensing
device
reacted
engines
one
and
two
were
throttled
back
and
the
rocket
straightened
a
second
device
shifted
the
mix
on
engine
three
bringing
thrust
into
balance
all
three
engines
resumed
full
power
thousand
feet
prochaska
chattered
his
voice
was
tinny
over
the
small
insert
earphone
provided
for
communications
especially
for
those
first
few
hellish
moments
when
the
whole
universe
seemed
collapsed
into

they
hurtled
through
the

all
life
had
been
choked
from
it
a
hot
metal
ball
filled
his
chest
he
could
breathe
panic
until
he
remembered
to
breathe
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
at
eighteen
miles
a
gale
of
wind
drove
west
rudders
on
the
aztec
compensated
she
leaned
slightly
into
the

negating
its

the

rudders

the

slanted
skyward
faster
faster
prochaska
called
off

almost
continuously
the
chattering
gone
from
his
voice
crag
was
still
struggling
against
the
pinning
weight
when
it
decreased
vanished
the
firestream
from
the
tail
pipe
gave
a
burst
of
smoke
and
died
burnout
the
aztec
hurtled
toward
the
laden
ionosphere
driven
only
by
the
inertial
forces
generated
in
the
now
silent
thrust
chambers
the
hard
components
of
cosmic

fast
mesons
high

protons
and
neutrons
would
rip
through
the

dogs
and

can
take
it
so
can
that
what
gotch
had
said
he
hoped
gotch
was
right
somewhere
now
the
first

would
fall
away
it
would
follow
them
at
ever
greater
distances
until
finally
its
trajectory
would
send
it
plunging
homeward
cut
in
prochaska
voice
was
a
loud
boom
in
the
silence
a
strident
voice
from
the
communicator
was
trying
to
tell
them
they
were
right
on
the
button
crag
moved
a
second
switch
the
resultant
acceleration
drove
him
against
the
back
of
his
seat
violently
expelling
the
air
from
his
lungs
he
fought
against
the
increasing
gravities
conscious
of
pressure
and
noise
in
his
ears
pressure
and
noise
mixed
with
fragments
of
voice
his
lips
pulled
tight
against
his
teeth
the
thudding
was
his
heart
he
tightened
his
stomach
muscles
trying
to
ease
the
weight
on
his
chest
a
mighty
hand
was
gripped
around
his
lungs
squeezing
out
the
air
but
it
was
as
bad
as
the
first
time
they
were
piercing
the
thermosphere
where
the
outside
temperature
gradient
would
zoom
upward
toward
the
degree

prochaska
spoke
into
his

fifty
miles
crag
marveled
at
his
control
his
calm
no
he
did
have
to
worry
about
the
chief
the
little
runt
had
it
crag
tried
to
grin
the
effort
was
a
pain
the
aztec
gave
a
lurch
altering
the
direction
of
forces
on
their
bodies
again
as
a
servo
control
kicked
the
ship
into
the
long
shallow
spiral
of
escape
it
moved
upward
and
more
easterly
its
nose
slanted
toward
the
stars
seeking
its
new
course
crag
became
momentarily
dizzy
his
vision
blurred
the
instrument
panel
became
a
kaleidoscope
of
dancing
merging
patterns
then
it
was
past
all
except
the
three
g
force
nailing
him
to
the
seat
he
spoke
into
the

how
we
doing
fine
commander
just
fine
gotch
rasped
the
toughest
part
over
over
like
hell
crag
thought
a

to
the

and
he
tells
me
the
toughest
part
over

i
should
work
in
a

miles
and
two
hundred
miles
east
the
chief
intoned
crag
made
a
visual
instrument
check
everything
looked
okay
no
red
lights
just
greens
wonderful
greens
that
meant
everything
was
he
liked
green
he
wanted
to
see
how
larkwell
and
nagel
were
making
out
but
could
turn
his
head
it
rougher
on
them
he
thought
they
ca
see
the
instruments
ca
hear
the
small
voice
from
alpine
they
just
have
to
sit
and
take
it
sit
and
feel
the
unearthly
pressures
and
weights
and
hope
everything
okay

prochaska
chanted
a
short
while
later
it
as
easy
as
that
crag
thought
years
and
years
of
planning
and
training
then
you
just
step
in
and
go
not
that
they
were
there
yet
he
remembered
the
rockets
that
had
burned
exploded
the
drifting
hulks
that
still
orbited
around
the
earth
no
it
was
over
yet
not
by
a
long
shot
the
quiet
came
again
the
earth
seen
through
the
side
port
seemed
tremendously
far
away
it
was
a
study
in
greens
and
and
whitish
ragged
areas
where
the
eye
was
blocked
by
cloud
formations
straight
out
the
sky
was
black
starry
prochaska
reached
up
and
swung
the
glare
shield
over
the
forward
port
the
sun
looked
at
even
indirectly
was
a
blinding
orb
intolerable
to
the
unprotected
eye
night
above
day
below
a
sun
that
blazed
without
breaking
the
ebon
skies
strange
crag
mused
he
had
been
prepared
for
this
prepared
by
long
hours
of
instruction
but
now
confronted
with
a
day
that
was
night
he
could
only
wonder
for
a
moment
he
felt
small
insignificant
and
wondered
at
brazen
man
who
dared
come
here
i
dared
he
thought
a
feeling
of
pride
grew
within
him
i
dared
the
stars
are
mine
stage
three
was
easy
by
comparison
it
began
with
the
muted
roar
of
thrust
chambers
almost
behind
them
a
noise
spectrum
almost
solely
confined
to
the
interior
of
the
rocket
outside
there
was
no
longer
sufficient
air
molecules
to
convey
even
a
whisper
of
sound
nor
was
there
a
pressure
the
stage
three
engine
was
designed
for
extremely
low
thrust
extended
over
a
correspondingly
longer
time
it
would
drive
them
through
the
escape
spiral
an
orbital
path
around
the
earth
during
which
time
they
would
slowly
increase
both
altitude
and
speed
crag
body
felt
light
not
total
weightlessness
but
extremely
light
his
instruments
told
him
they
were
breaching
the
exosphere
where
molecular
matter
had
almost
ceased
to
exist
the
atoms
of
the
exosphere
were
lonely
uncrowded
isolated
particles
it
was
the
top
of
the
air
ocean
where
heretofore
only
monkeys
dogs
and
smaller
test
animals
had
gone
it
was
the
realm
of
sputniks
explorers
vanguards
all
the
test
rockets
which
had
made
the
aztec
possible
they
still
sped
their
silent
orbits
borne
on
the

tides
of

eternal
tombs
of

and
after

the

gave
a
burp
a
voice
came
through
the
static
drone
able

aloft
it
had
blasted
off
from
its
blasting
pad
at
burning
sands
just
moments
after
the
aztec
prochaska
bent
over
the
radarscope
and
fiddled
with
some
knobs
the
tube
glowed
and
dimmed
then
it
was
there
a
tiny
pip
alpine
came
in
with
more
data
they
watched
its
course
somewhere
far
below
them
and
hundreds
of
miles
to
the
west
human
minds
were
guiding
the
drone
by
telemeter
control
vectoring
it
through
space
to
meet
the
aztec
it
was
crag
thought
applied
mathematics
he
marveled
at
the
science
which
enabled
them
to
do
it
one
moment
the
drone
was
just
a
pip
on
the
scope
climbing
up
from
the
sere
earth
riding
a
firestream
to
the
skies
the
next
it
was
tons
of
metal
scorching
through
space
cutting
into
their
flight
path
a
giant
screaming
up
from
its
cradle
it
was
prochaska
turn
to
sweat
the
job
of
taking
it
over
was
his
he
bent
over
his
instruments

tuned
to
the

fingers
nervous
on
the

the
drone
hurtled
toward
them
at
a
frightening

crag
kept
his
fingers
on
the
steering
controls
just
in
case
his
mind
following
the
chief
hands
they
began
moving
more
certainly
prochaska
tossed
his
head
impatiently
bending
lower
over
the
instrument
console
crag
strained
against
his
harnessing
to
see
out
of
the
side
port
the
drone
was
visible
now
a
silver
shaft
growing
larger
with
appalling
rapidity
a
thin
skein
of
vapor
trailed
from
its
trail
fluffing
into
nothingness
angle
of

remains
constant
you
on

the
words
from
the
flying
safety
manual
popped
into
his
mind
he
studied
the
drone
angle
of
closure
was
constant
crag
hesitated
even
a
touch
on
the
steering
rockets
could
be
bad
very
bad
the
slightest
change
in
course
at
their
present
speed
would
impose
tremendous
g
forces
on
their
bodies
perhaps
greater
than
they
could
stand
he
looked
at
the
chief
and
licked
his
lips
the
man
was
intent
on
his
instruments
seemingly
lost
to
the
world
his
fingers
had
ceased
all
random
movement
every
motion
had
precise
meaning
he
was
hooked
onto
drone
able
steering
rockets
now
manipulating
the
controls
with
extreme
precision
he
was
a
concert
pianist
playing
the
strident
music
of

an
overture
written
in
metal
and
flaming

announced
without
moving
his
eyes
from

he
gradually
narrowed
the
distance
between
the
rockets
until
they
were
hurtling
through
space
on
parallel
courses
scant
miles
apart
he
gave
a
final
check
and
looked
at
crag
they
simultaneously
emitted
big
sighs
had
me
worried
for
a
moment
crag
confessed
me
too
the
chief
looked
out
of
the
side
port
man
it
looks
like
a
battle
wagon
crag
squinted
through
the
port
drone
able
was
a
silver
bullet
in
space
a
twin
of
the
aztec
except
in
color
a
drone
with
view
ports
he
smiled
thoughtfully
every
exterior
of
the
drone
had
been
planned
to
make
it
appear
like
a
manned
vehicle
gotch
was
the
architect
of
that
bit
of
deception
he
thought
the
colonel
had
missed
a
bet
he
looked
at
the
earth
it
was
a
behemoth
in
space
a
huge
curved
surface
falling
away
in
all
directions
a
mosaic
of
grays
punctuated
by
swaths
of
tints
and
splotches
of
white
where
fleecy
clouds
rode
the
top
of
the
troposphere
his
momentary
elation
vanished
replaced
by
an
odd
depression
the
world
was
far
away
retreating
into
the
cosmic
mists
the
aftermath
he
thought
a
chill
presentiment
crept
into
his
mind
a
premonition
of
impending
disaster
chapter
the
communicator
came
to
life
with
data
on
pickering
the
satelloid
was
moving
higher
faster
than
the
aztec
riding
the
rim
of
the
exosphere
where
the
atmosphere
is
indistinguishable
from
absolute
space
crag
felt
thankful
he
had
been
tabbed
for
the
job
the
satelloid
was
a
fragile
thing
compared
to
the
aztec
a
moth
compared
to
a
hawk
it
was
a
relative
handful
of
light
metals
and
delicate
electronic
components
yet
it
moved
at
frightful
speeds
over
the
course
the
armchair
astronauts
had
dubbed
sputnik
avenue
it
was
a
piloted
vehicle
a
mite
with
small
stubby
wings
to
enable
it
to
glide
through
the
air
ocean
to
safe
sanctuary
after
orbiting
the
earth
pickering
would
be
crouched
in
its
scant
belly
a
space
hardly
larger
than
his
body
cramped
in
a
pressure
suit
that
made
movement
all
but
impossible
his
smallest
misjudgment
would
spell
instant
death
crag
marveled
at
pickering
audacity
clearly
he
had
the
roughest
mission
while
he
thought
about
it
he
kept
one
part
of
his
mind
centered
on
the
communicator
absorbing
the
data
on
the
satelloid
position
and
speed
the
northern
tip
of
africa
came
up
fast
the
dark
continent
of
history
seen
from
the
borders
of
space
was
a
splotch
hemmed
by
blue
the
satelloid
was
still
beyond
the
aztec
radar
range
but
a
data
link
analog
painted
in
the
relationship
between
the
two
space
vehicles
the
instrument
automatic
grid
measured
the
distance
between
them
in
hundreds
of
miles
pickering
aloft
before
them
had
fled
into
the
east
and
already
was
beginning
to
overtake
them
from
the
west
the
ships
were
seen
on
the
analog
as
two
pips
two
mites
aloft
in
the
air
ocean
crag
marveled
at
the
satelloid
tremendous
speed
it
was
a
ray
of
metal
flashing
along
the
fringes
of
space
a
rapier
coming
out
of
the
west
the
middle
east
passed
under
them
receding
a
mass
of
and
occasional
splotches
the
earth
was
a
giant
curvature
not
yet
an
orb
passing
into
the
shadow
of
night
it
was
a
night
of
fantastic
shortness
broken
by
daylight
over
the
pacific
the
ocean
was
an
incredible
blue
he
decided
the
harsh
sound
of
the
communicator
came
to
life
someone
wanted
a
confab
with
crag
a
private
confab
prochaska
wrinkled
his
brow
questioningly
crag
switched
to
his
ear
insert
phone
and
acknowledged
a
moment
a
voice
said
he
waited
commander
we
bad
news
for
you
it
was
gotch
voice
a
rasp
coming
over
a
great
distance
the

a

being
tracked
by

comsopac
picked
it
up
it
on

course
crag
thoughts
raced
the
was
the

code
name
any
idea
what
kind
probably
a
missile
riding
a
beam
right
to
you
or
the
drone
he
added
he
was
silent
for
a
second
well
we
sort
of
expected
this
might
happen
commander
it
a
tough
complication
a
helluva
lot
of
good
that
does
crag
thought
what
next
another
set
of
pilots
more
indoctrination
new
rockets
another
zero
hour
gotch
would
win
the
moon
if
he
had
to
use
the
whole
air
force
he
said
well
been
a
nice
trip
so
far
get
prochaska
on
the
scope
he
on
and
hold
it
the
chief
was
making
motions
toward
the
scope
no
it
the
satelloid
he
gotch
broke
in
with
more
data
then
it
was
there
he
got
it
crag
announced
gotch
was
silent
he
watched
the
analog
all
three
pips
were
visible
the
satelloid
was
still
above
them
rushing
in
fast
the
interceptor
was
lower
to
the
northwest
cutting
into
their
path
he
thought
it
was
the
drone
able
story
all
over
again
only
this
time
it
was
a
supply
rocket
it
was
a
warhead
a
situation
they
could
control
control
or
could
they
he
debated
the
question
then
quickly
briefed
prochaska
and
cut
him
in
on
the
com
circuit
we
can
use
drone
able
as
an
intercept
he
told
gotch
no
the
word
came
explosively
crag
snapped
drone
able
wo
be
a
damn
bit
of
good
without
the
aztec
no
this
is
ground
control
commander
gotch
abruptly
cut
off
crag
cursed
calling

calling

calling

are
you
receiving
over
the

came
faint
over
the
communicator
rising
and
falling
step
one
crag
said
adjusting
his
lip
mike
he
acknowledged
the
code
call
while
his
mind
registered
the
fact
it
was
alpine
base
there
was
a
burst
of
static
he
waited
a
moment
puzzled
calling
pickering
he
had
been
slow
in
recognizing
the
satelloid
code
call
the
voice
faded
was
lost
his
thought
raced
pickering
was
up
there
in
the
satelloid
moving
higher
faster
than
the
aztec
hurtling
along
the
rim
of
space
in
a
great
circle
around
the
earth
the
rocket
ship
was
a
minute
particle
in
infinity
yet
it
represented
a
part
in
the
great
adventure
it
was
the
hand
of
michael
gotch
reaching
toward
them
for
the
instant
the
knowledge
gave
him
a
ray
of
hope
hope
as
quickly
dashed
the
was
just
a
observation
and
relay
platform
a
manned
vehicle
traveling
the
communication
orbit
established
by
the
army
earlier
explorer
missiles
he
turned
back
to
prochaska
and
sketched
in
his
plan
of
using
drone
able
as
an
intercept
could
be
the
chief
bit
his
lip
reflectively
we
could
control
her
through
her
steering
rockets
but
we
have
to
be
plenty
sharp
only
get
one
crack
chances
are
the
intercept
is
working
on
a
proximity
fuse
crag
reasoned
all
we
have
to
do
is
work
the
drone
into
its
flight
path
we
could
use
our
own
steering
rockets
to
give
us
a
bigger
margin
of
safety
what
would
the
loss
of
able
mean
crag
shrugged
i
more
concerned
with
what
the
loss
of
the
aztec
would
mean
might
work
the
chief
looked
sharply
at
him
what
does
alpine
say
they
say
nuts
crag
looked
at
the
scope
the
intercept
was
much
nearer
so
was
the
pickering
probably
coming
in
for
an
report
he
thought
sourly
probably
got
an
automatic
camera
so
gotch
can
watch
the
show
he
looked
quizzically
at
prochaska
the
chief
wore
a
frozen
mask
he
got
back
on
the
communicator
and
repeated
his
request
when
he
finished
there
was
a
dead
silence
in
the
void
the
colonel
answer
was
unprintable
he
looked
thoughtfully
at
prochaska
last
time
he
broken
ground
orders
he
been
invited
to
leave
the

force
but
gotch
had
taken
him
despite
that
he
glanced
over
his

trying
to
formulate
a

larkwell

watched
him
with
a
narrow
look
he
pushed
the
oxygen
man
from
his
mind
and
turned
back
to
the
analog
the
pip
that
was
pickering
had
moved
a
long
way
across
the
grid
the
altitude
needle
tied
into
the
grid
showed
that
the
satelloid
was
dropping
fast
the
intercept
was
nearer
too
much
nearer
prochaska
watched
the
scene
on
his
radarscope
she
coming
fast
he
murmured
his
face
had
paled
too
fast
crag
gritted
he
got
on
the
communicator
and
called
alpine
gotch
came
on
immediately
crag
said
defiantly
we
going
to
use
drone
able
as
an
intercept
it
the
only
chance
commander
i
ordered
ground
control
the
colonel
voice
was
icy
biting
ground
has
no
control
over
this
situation
crag
snapped
angrily
i
said
ground
control
commander
that
final
i
using
drone
able
commander
crag
you
wind
up
cleaning
the
heads
at
alpine
gotch
raged
do
move
that
drone
for
a
moment
the
situation
struck
him
as
humorous
just
now
he
like
to
be
guaranteed
the
chance
to
clear
the
heads
at
alpine
base
it
sounded
good
real
good
there
was
another
burst
of
static
pickering
voice
came
in
louder
clearer
a
snap
through
the
ether
do
sacrifice
the
drone
commander
do
you
know
a
better
way
pickering
voice
dropped
to
a
laconic
drawl
reckon
so
crag
glanced
at
the
analog
and
gave
a
visible
start
the
satelloid
was
lower
moving
in
faster
along
a
course
which
would
take
it
obliquely
through
the
space
path
being
traversed
by
the
aztec
if
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
wake
in
space
that
where
the
satelloid
would
chop
through
cutting
down
toward
the
intercept
he
using
his
power
he
thought
the
scant
amount
of
fuel
he
would
need
for
landing
but
if
he
used
it
up
he
slashed
the
thought
off
and
swung
to
the
communicator
step
one
to
step
one
to
pickering
came
in
immediately
crag
barked
you
ca
that
my
job
pickering
cut
in
you
got
ta
get
that
bucket
to
the
moon
crag
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
communicator
okay
he
said
finally
thanks
fellow
do
mention
it
the
air
force
is
always
ready
to
serve
pickering
said
adios
he
cut
off
crag
stared
at
the
analog
biting
his
lip
feeling
the
emotion
surge
inside
him
it
grew
to
a
tumult
skipper
prochaska
voice
was
startled
for
god
sake
look
crag
swung
his
eyes
to
the
scope
the
blip
representing
pickering
had
cut
their
flight
path
slicing
obliquely
through
their
wake
at
its
tremendous
speed
only
the
almost
total
absence
of
air
molecules
kept
the
satelloid
from
turning
into
a
blazing
torch
down
down
plunging
to
meet
the
death
roaring
up
from
the
pacific
they
followed
it
silently
a
brief
flare
showed
on
the
scope
they
looked
at
the
screen
for
a
long
moment
he
was
a
brave
man
prochaska
said
simply
a
pile
of
guts
crag
got
on
the
communicator
gotch
listened
when
he
had
finished
gotch
said
after
this
commander
follow
ground
orders
you
damned
near
fouled
up
the
works
i
do
want
to
see
that
happen
again
yes
sir
but
i
could
have
expected
that
move
what
do
you
think
pickering
was
up
there
for
gotch
asked
softly
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
that
was
his
job
just
like
the
couple
that
got
bumped
at
the
blue
door
it
tough
commander
but
some
people
have
to
die
a
lot
have
already
and
there
be
a
lot
more
he
added
brusquely
you
get
your
chance
the
communicator
was
silent
for
a
moment
well
carry
on
aye
aye
sir
crag
said
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
larkwell
was
leaning
over
in
his
seat
twisting
his
body
to
see
out
the
side
port
his
face
was
filled
with
the
wonder
of
space
nagel
stir
his
eyes
were
big
saucers
in
his
white
thin
face
crag
half
expected
to
see
his
lips
quiver
and
wondered
briefly
at
the
courage
it
must
have
taken
for
him
to
volunteer
he
did
seem
at
all
like
the
hero
type
still
look
at
napoleon
you
could
never
tell
what
a
man
had
until
the
chips
were
down
well
the
chips
down
nagel
better
have
it
he
turned
reflectively
back
to
the
forward
port
thinking
that
the
next
two
days
would
be
humdrum
nothing
would
ever
seem
tough
again
not
after
what
they
had
just
been
through
prochaska
fell
into
the
routine
of
calling
out
altitude
and
speed
crag
listened
with
one
part
of
his
mind
occupied
with
pickering
sacrifice
would
he
have
had
the
courage
to
drive
the
satelloid
into
the
warhead
did
it
take
more
guts
to
do
that
than
to
double
for
a
man
slated
to
be
murdered
he
mulled
the
questions
plainly
step
one
was
jammed
with
heroes
altitude
miles
speed
prochaska
whispered
the
words
awe
in
his
voice
they
looked
at
each
other
wordlessly
we
made
it
crag
exulted
we
on
that
old
moon
trajectory
the
chiefs
face
reflected
his
wonder
crag
studied
his
instruments
speed
slightly
over
miles
per
hour
the
radar
altimeter
showed
the
aztec
slightly
more
than
one
thousand
miles
above
the
earth
surface
he
hesitated
then
cut
off
the
third
stage
engine
the
fuel
gauge
indicated
a
bare
few
gallons
left
this
small
amount
he
knew
represented
error
in
the
precise
computations
of
escape
well
the
extra
weight
was
negligible
at
the
same
time
they
could
afford
added
acceleration
he
became
aware
that
the
last
vestige
of
weight
had
vanished
he
moved
his
hand
no
effort
no
effort
at
all
space
he
thought
the
first
successful
manned
space
ship
elation
swept
him
he
adam
crag
was
in
space
not
just
the
top
of
the
atmosphere
but
absolute
space
the
big
vacuum
that
surrounded
the
world
this
had
been
the
aim
the
dream
the
goal
and
so
quick
he
flicked
his
mind
back
it
seemed
almost
no
time
at
all
since
the
germans
had
electrified
the
world
with
the
a
primitive
rocket
that
scarcely
reached
seventy
miles
above
the
earth
creeping
at
a
mere
miles
per
hour
the
americans
had
strapped
a
second
stage
to
the
german
prototype
creating
the
corporal
and
sending
it
miles
into
the
tall
blue
at
speeds
better
than
miles
per
hour
it
had
been
a
battle
even
then
he
thought
remembering
the
dark
day
the
russians
beat
the
west
with
sputnik
i
seemingly
demolished
it
with
sputnik
ii
until
the
army
came
through
with
explorer
i
that
had
been
the
real
beginning
irbm
and
icbm
had
been
born
missiles
and
dogs
monkeys
and
mice
had
ridden
the
fringes
of
space
but
never
man
a
deep
sense
of
satisfaction
flooded
him
the
aztec
had
been
the
first
the
aztec
under
commander
adam
crag
the
full
sense
of
the
accomplishment
was
just
beginning
to
strike
him
we
beaten
the
enemy
he
thought
we
won
it
had
been
a
grim
battle
waged
on
a
technological
front
a
battle
between
nations
in
which
ironically
each
victory
by
either
side
took
mankind
a
step
nearer
emancipation
from
the
world
man
could
look
forward
now
to
a
bright
shiny
path
leading
to
the
stars
this
was
the
final
step
the
big
step
the
step
that
would
tie
together
two
worlds
in
a
few
short
days
the
aztec
would
reach
her
lonely
destination
arzachel
a
bleak
spot
in
the
universe
adam
crag
the
man
in
the
moon
he
hoped
he
turned
toward
the
others
trying
to
wipe
the
smug
look
from
his
face
the
oddity
of
weightlessness
was
totally
unlike
anything
he
had
expected
despite
the
fact
its
symptoms
had
been
carefully
explained
during
the
indoctrination
program
he
was
sitting
in
the
pilot
seat
yet
he
was
he
felt
no
sense
of
pressure
against
the
seat
or
against
anything
else
for
that
matter
it
was
he
thought
like
sitting
on
air
as
light
as
a
mote
of
dust
drifting
in
a
breeze
sure
he
experienced
weightlessness
before
when
pushing
a
research
stratojet
through
a
trajectory
to
counter
the
pull
of
gravity
for
example
but
those
occasions
had
lasted
only
brief
moments
he
moved
his
hand
experimentally
upward
a
move
that
ended
like
the
strike
of
a
snake
yeah
it
was
going
to
take
some
doing
to
learn
control
of
his
movements
he
looked
at
prochaska
the
chief
was
feeding
data
to
alpine
base
he
finished
and
grinned
broadly
at
crag
his
eyes
were
elated
sort
of
startling
is
it
amen
crag
agreed
i
almost
afraid
to
loosen
my
harnessing
alpine
says
we
right
on
the
button
schedule
course
and
speed
there
a
gal
operator
on
now
that
good
that
means
we
back
to
routine
crag
loosened
his
harnesses
and
twisted
around
in
his
seat
larkwell
was
moving
his
hands
experimentally
he
saw
crag
and
grinned
foolishly
nagel
looked
his
face
was
pinched
bloodless
his
eyes
he
caught
crag
look
and
nodded
without
expression
pretty
rough
crag
said
sympathetically
his
voice
in
the
silence
possessed
a
curious
muffled
effect
we
past
the
worst
nagel
lips
twisted
derisively
yeah
the
querulous
tone
grated
crag
and
he
turned
back
to
the
controls
minor
irritant
will
assume
major
that
what
doc
weldon
had
warned
well
damnit
he
would
let
nagel
get
him
down
besides
what
was
his
gripe
they
were
all
in
the
same
boat
he
turned
to
the
instrument
console
checking
the
myriad
of
dials
gauges
and
scopes
everything
seemed
normal
if
there
was
such
a
thing
as
normalcy
in
space
he
said
reflectively
speaking
to
no
one
in
particular
maybe
i
should
have
been
more
truthful
with
the
colonel
before
taking
on
this
damned
job
of
moon
pilot
there
something
i
did
tell
him
what
prochaska
face
was
startled
i
never
been
to
the
moon
before
chapter
alpine
wants
a
private
confab
prochaska
said
his
voice
was
ominous
probably
another
stinker
again
crag
plugged
in
his
ear
insert
microphone
thinking
he
going
to
like
what
he
hear
just
when
things
had
started
looking
smooth
too
he
cut
prochaska
out
of
the
system
and
acknowledged
crag
gotch
voice
was
brittle
hard
he
looked
sideways
at
prochaska
who
was
studiously
examining
one
of
the
instruments
trying
to
give
him
the
privacy
demanded
he
shifted
his
head
larkwell
was
standing
at
the
side
port
with
his
back
toward
him
nagel
lay
back
in
his
seat
eyes
closed
crag
answered
softly
shoot
more
bad
news
gotch
reported
somberly
burning
sands
picked
a
package
out
of
drone
able
just
before
launch
time
it
just
been
identified
check
he
replied
trying
to
assimilate
what
gotch
was
telling
him
gotch
stated
flatly
it
was
a
time
bomb
here
a
description
bomb
was
packaged
in
a
flat
black
plastic
case
about
one
by
four
inches
probably
not
big
enough
to
wreck
the
drone
but
big
enough
to
destroy
the
controls
it
was
found
tucked
in
the
wiring
of
the
main
panel
got
that
check
the
bomb
squad
has
come
through
with
full
details
yet
if
you
find
a
mate
do
try
to
disarm
it
dump
it
pronto
ca
it
stay
with
us
it
size
indicates
it
would
be
fatal
if
it
exploded
outside
the
hull
gotch
rasped
it
was
designed
to
wreck
controls
if
you
find
one
dump
it
that
an
order
the
earphones
were
silent
crag
was
swiveling
toward
prochaska
when
they
came
to
life
again
one
other
thing
gotch
was
silent
for
a
moment
crag
pictured
him
carefully
framing
his
words
it
means
that
the
situation
is
worse
than
we
thought
he
said
finally
they
have
left
anything
to
chance
if
you
have
a
bomb
it
was
carried
there
after
the
final
security
check
do
you
follow
me
yeah
crag
answered
thoughtfully
he
sat
for
a
moment
debating
what
to
do
prochaska
did
ask
any
questions
gotch
was
telling
him
that
the
aztec
might
be
mined
wait
what
else
had
he
said
bomb
was
carried
there
after
the
security
that
spelled
traitor
the
aztec
had
been
shaken
down
too
often
and
too
thoroughly
for
intelligence
to
have
muffed
it
would
have
to
have
been
planted
at
the
last
moment
if
there
was
a
bomb
he
better
keep
quiet
until
gotch
suspicions
were
proven
false
or
verified
he
turned
toward
prochaska
keeping
his
voice
low
search
the
console
panels
every
inch
of
them
he
looked
around
nagel
and
larkwell
were
back
in
their
seats
nagel
seemed
asleep
but
larkwell
face
was
speculative
crag
eyes
swept
the
cabin
spare
oxygen
tanks
packaged
pressure
suits
water
vents
chemical
commode
the
algae
chamber
and
spare
chemicals
to
absorb
carbon
dioxide
in
case
the
algae
system
failed
these
and
more
items
filled
every
wall
cupboard
occupied
every
cubic
inch
of
space
beyond
the
bare
room
needed
for
human
movement
where
was
the
most
sensitive
spot
the
controls
he
sighed
and
turned
back
to
the
panels
prochaska
was
methodically
running
his
hands
through
the
complex
of
wiring
under
the
instrument
panels
his
face
was
a
question
the
face
of
a
man
who
did
know
what
he
was
looking
for
he
decided
not
to
tell
him
yet
his
earphones
gave
a
burst
of
static
followed
by
the
colonel
hurried
voice
burning
sands
reports
packaged
timed
for
he
snapped
eight
minutes
away
get
on
the
ball
if
you
got
one
there
probably
a
twin
okay
crag
acknowledged
adios
we
got
work
to
do
he
swung
toward
nagel
break
out
the
pressure
suits
he
barked
lend
him
a
hand
larkwell
nagel
eyes
opened
pressure
suits
check
we
may
need
them
in
a
couple
of
minutes
but
get
to
it
crag
rasped
it
may
be
a
matter
of
life
or
death
he
turned
prochaska
was
still
examining
the
wiring
no
time
to
search
the
rest
of
the
cabin
he
thought
it
might
be
anywhere
it
would
have
to
be
the
panels
or
nothing
besides
that
was
the
most
logical
place
he
went
to
the
chief
assistance
searching
the
panels
on
his
side
of
the
board
pushing
his
fingers
gently
between
the
maze
of
wiring
nothing
below
the
analog
the
engine
instruments
the
radar
altimeter
he
glanced
at
the
chronometer
and
began
to
sweat
the
hands
on
the
dial
seemed
to
be
racing
prochaska
finished
his
side
of
the
console
and
looked
sideways
at
him
better
tell
him
crag
thought
he
said
calmly
time
bomb
burning
sands
says
if
we
have
one
it
may
blow
in
he
glanced
hurriedly
at
the
chronometer
five
minutes
prochaska
looked
hurriedly
at
the
array
of
gear
lining
the
bulkheads
probably
in
the
controls
if
we
have
one
crag
finished
the
panels
on
his
side
without
any
luck
prochaska
hastily
started
the
wiring
crag
followed
after
him
a
moment
later
his
fingers
found
it
a
smooth
flat
case
deeply
imbedded
between
the
wiring
prochaska
had
gone
over
that
panel
a
moment
before
the
thought
struck
him
even
as
he
moved
it
out
handling
it
gingerly
prochaska
showed
his
surprise
crag
glanced
at
nagel
and
larkwell
they
had
the
suits
free
he
laid
the
bomb
on
the
console
larkwell
saw
it
his
face
showed
understanding
he
heaved
one
of
the
suits
to
prochaska
and
a
second
one
to
crag
they
hurriedly
donned
them
space
limitations
made
it
an
awkward
task
crag
kept
his
eyes
on
the
chronometer
the
hand
seemed
to
whiz
across
the
dial
he
began
to
sweat
conscious
that
he
was
breathing
heavily
short
exposure
he
rapped
out
minimum
pressure
he
slipped
on
his
helmet
secured
it
to
the
neck
ring
and
snapped
on
the
face
plate
he
turned
the
oxygen
valve
and
felt
the
pressure
build
up
within
the
suit
and
helmet
the
chronometer
showed
two
minutes
to
go
he
snapped
a
glance
around
nagel
peered
at
him
through
his
thick
face
plate
with
a
worried
expression
larkwell
lips
were
compressed
against
his
teeth
his
jaws
worked
spasmodically
both
were
waiting
tense
watching
him
prochaska
was
the
last
to
finish
crag
waited
impatiently
for
him
to
switch
on
his
oxygen
valve
before
picking
up
the
bomb
he
motioned
the
others
to
stand
back
and
began
opening
the
dogs
which
secured
the
escape
hatch
he
hesitated
on
the
last
one
the
escaping
air
could
whisk
him
into
space
in
a
flash
the
same
thing
had
happened
to
crewmen
riding
in
bubbles
that
broke
at
high
altitude
whoosh
he
be
gone
conceivably
it
could
suck
the
cabin
clean
fortunately
their
gear
had
been
secured
as
protection
against
the
high
g
forces
of
escape
too
late
to
lash
himself
with
the
seat
harnessing
time
was
running
out
panic
touched
his
mind
calm
down
crag
he
told
himself
play
it
cool
boy
prochaska
saw
his
dilemma
at
the
same
instant
he
squatted
on
the
deck
and
thrust
his
legs
straight
out
from
the
hips
straddling
one
of
the
seat
supports
larkwell
and
nagel
hurriedly
followed
suit
crag
cast
a
backward
glance
at
the
chronometer
a
minute
and
ten
seconds
to
go
he
threw
himself
to
one
side
of
the
hatch
squatted
and
hooked
an
arm
into
a
panel
console
hoping
it
was
strong
enough
he
laid
the
bomb
on
the
deck
next
to
the
hatch
and
reached
up
with
his
free
hand
held
his
breath
hesitated
and
jarred
the
last
dog
loose
the
hatch
exploded
open
a
giant
claw
seemed
to
grab
his
body
pulling
him
toward
the
opening
it
passed
as
quickly
as
it
came
leaving
him
weak
breathless
the
bomb
had
been
whisked
into
space
he
got
to
his
feet
and
grasped
the
hatch
combing
looking
out
it
was
a
giddy
vertiginous
moment
before
him
yawned
a
great
maw
a
blacker
purple
than
that
seen
through
the
view
ports
it
was
studded
with
unbelievably
brilliant
stars
agleam
with
the
hard
luster
of
diamonds
white
diamonds
and
blue
sapphires
bright
blinked
in
he
hesitated
the
cold
was
already
coming
through
his
suit
he
remembered
he
had
turned
on
either
the
heating
element
or
interphone
system
he
drew
the
hatch
shut
and
dogged
it
down
then
switched
both
on
the
others
saw
his
movements
and
followed
suit
see
anything
prochaska
was
the
first
to
ask
his
voice
sounded
tinny
and
far
away
crag
adjusted
his
amplifier
and
said
grimly
it
blew
how
how
did
it
get
here
he
identified
the
voice
as
nagel
he
snapped
brusquely
that
what
i
going
to
find
out
larkwell
was
silent
nagel
began
fiddling
with
the
oxygen
valves
they
waited
quietly
each
absorbed
in
his
thoughts
until
nagel
indicated
it
was
safe
to
remove
their
suits
crag
thoughts
raced
while
he
shucked
the
heavy
garments
it
past
he
thought
but
the
saboteur
still
here
who
he
flicked
his
eyes
over
the
men
who
that
what
he
had
to
find
out
soon
when
the
suit
was
off
he
hurriedly
put
through
a
call
to
gotch
reporting
what
had
happened
the
colonel
listened
without
comment
when
crag
finished
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
finally
he
replied
here
where
we
stand
we
will
immediately
comb
the
record
of
every
intelligence
agent
involved
in
the
last
shakedown
we
also
recomb
the
records
of
the
aztec
crew
including
yours
i
got
to
tell
you
this
because
it
serious
if
there
a
saboteur
aboard
and
i
think
there
is
then
the
whole
operation
in
jeopardy
it
be
up
to
you
to
keep
your
eyes
open
and
analyze
your
men
we
tried
to
be
careful
checked
everyone
involved
back
to
birth
but
there
always
the
sleeper
it
happened
before
check
crag
said
i
only
hope
you
do
catch
up
with
all
my
early
peccadillos
this
is
no
time
to
be
funny
now
some
more
news
for
you
washington
reports
that
the
enemy
launched
another
missile
this
morning
another
one
crag
sighed
softly
this
time
there
would
be
no
satelloid
no
pickering
to
give
his
life
the
colonel
continued
grimly
radar
indicates
this
is
a
different
kind
of
rocket
its
rate
of
climb
its
trajectory
indicates
manned
now
it
a
race
crag
thought
a
moment
any
sign
of
a
drone
with
it
no
that
the
surprising
part
if
this
is
a
attempt
at
establishing
a
moon
base
and
we
believe
it
is
crag
asked
sharply
it
could
be
their
job
the
possibility
filled
him
with
alarm
positively
not
we
got
our
finger
squarely
on
that
one
and
it
a
good
year
from
no
this
is
a
conventional
rocket
perhaps
more
advanced
than
we
had
believed
his
voice
dropped
off
we
keep
you
posted
he
added
after
a
minute
roger
crag
sighed
he
removed
the
earphone
reflectively
he
tell
the
others
yet
now
that
they
were
in
space
maybe
just
maybe
he
could
find
time
to
catch
his
breath
damn
they
anticipated
all
this
during
indoctrination
the
time
bomb
possible
traitor
in
the
crew
what
more
could
go
wrong
for
just
a
second
he
felt
an
intense
hostility
toward
gotch
an
air
force
full
of
pilots
and
he
had
to
pick
him
and
he
was
even
in
the
air
force
at
the
time
lord
he
should
have
contented
himself
with
jockeying
a
jet
airliner
on
some
nice
quiet
hop
like
between
and
pearl
with
a
girl
at
each
end
of
the
run
he
thought
wistfully
about
the
prospect
while
he
made
a
routine
check
of
the
instruments
cabin
pressure
normal
temperature
degrees
nothing
alarming
in
the
radiation
and
meteor
impact
readings
carbon
dioxide
content
normal
things
might
get
routine
after
all
he
thought
moodily
except
for
one
thing
the
new
rocket
flashing
skyward
from
east
of
the
caspian
one
thing
he
was
sure
of
it
spelled
trouble
chapter
the
navy
space
scan
radar
station
no
picked
up
the
new
rocket
before
it
was
fairly
into
space
it
clung
to
it
with
an
electromagnetic
train
bleeding
it
of
data
the
information
was
fed
into
computers
digested
analyzed
and
transferred
to
alpine
base
and
thence
telemetered
to
the
aztec
where
it
appeared
as
a
pip
on
the
analog
display
the
grid
had
automatically
adjusted
to
a
scale
with
the
positions
of
the
intruder
and
aztec
separated
by
almost
the
width
of
the
instrument
face
the
aztec
seemed
to
have
a
clear
edge
in
the
race
for
the
moon
prochaska
became
aware
of
the
newcomer
but
refrained
from
questions
nor
did
crag
volunteer
any
information
just
now
he
was
worrying
about
the
east
world
rocket
not
at
this
point
with
drone
able
riding
to
starboard
the
aztec
was
moving
at
an
ever
slower
rate
of
speed
it
would
continue
to
decelerate
slowed
by
the
earth
pull
as
it
moved
outward
traveling
on
inertial
force
since
the
silencing
of
its
engines
by
the
time
it
reached
the
neutral
zone
where
the
moon
and
earth
gravispheres
canceled
each
other
the
aztec
would
have
just
enough
speed
left
to
coast
into
the
moon
field
of
influence
then
it
would
accelerate
again
picking
up
speed
until
slowed
by
its
braking
rockets
that
was
the
hour
that
occupied
his
thoughts
a
time
when
he
would
be
called
upon
for
decisions
coming
in
waves
he
tried
to
anticipate
every
contingency
the
mass
ratio
necessary
to
inject
the
aztec
into
its
moon
trajectory
had
precluded
fuel
beyond
the
absolute
minimum
needed
the
rocket
would
approach
the
moon
in
an
elliptical
path
correct
its
heading
to
a
line
relative
to
the
planet
and
decelerate
in
a
tight
spiral
at
a
precise
point
in
space
he
would
have
to
start
using
the
braking
rockets
slow
the
ship
until
they
occupied
an
exact
point
in
the
infinite
continuum
then
let
down
into
arzachel
a
bleak
airless
utterly
alien
wasteland
with
but
one
virtue
uranium
that
and
the
fact
that
it
represented
the
gateway
to
the
solar
system
he
mentally
reviewed
the
scene
a
hundred
times
he
would
do
this
and
this
and
that
he
rehearsed
each
step
each
operation
each
fleeting
second
in
which
all
the
long
years
of
planning
would
summate
in
victory
or
disaster
he
was
the
x
in
the
equation
in
which
the
was
represented
by
the
radar
altimeter
he
would
juggle
speed
deceleration
altitude
mass
and
a
dozen
other
variables
keeping
them
in
delicate
balance
nor
could
he
forget
for
one
second
the
hostile
architecture
of
their
destination
for
all
practical
purposes
arzachel
was
a
huge
hole
sunk
in
the
moon
a
vast
depression
undoubtedly
broken
by
rocks
rills
rough
lava
outcrops
the
task
struck
him
as
similar
to
trying
to
land
a
jet
in
a
well
shaft
well
almost
as
bad
he
tried
to
anticipate
possible
contingencies
formulating
his
responses
to
each
he
was
he
thought
like
an
actor
preparing
for
his
first
night
only
this
time
there
would
be
no
repeat
performance
the
critics
were
the
gods
of
chance
in
a
strictly
stand
gotch
was
the
man
who
had
placed
him
here
but
the
responsibility
was
all
his
gotch
all
he
gave
a
damn
about
was
the
moon
a
chunk
of
real
estate
scorned
by
its
maker
crag
bit
his
lip
ruefully
stop
feeling
sorry
for
yourself
boy
he
thought
you
asked
for
it
practically
begged
for
it
now
you
got
it
by
the
end
of
the
second
day
the
novelty
of
space
had
worn
off
crag
and
prochaska
routinely
checked
the
myriad
of
instruments
jammed
into
the
faces
of
the
consoles
meteorite
impact
counters
erosion
counters
radiation
counters
counters
of
all
kinds
little
numbers
on
dials
and
gauges
that
told
man
how
he
was
faring
in
the
wastelands
of
the
universe
nagel
kept
a
special
watch
on
the
oxygen
pressure
gauge
meteorite
damage
had
been
one
of
gotch
fears
a
hole
the
size
of
a
pinhead
could
mean
eventual
death
through
oxygen
loss
hence
nagel
seldom
let
a
pass
without
checking
the
readings
crag
and
prochaska
spelled
each
other
in
brief
catnaps
larkwell
with
no
duties
to
perform
was
restless
at
first
he
had
passed
long
hours
at
the
viewports
uttering
exclamations
of
surprise
and
delight
from
time
to
time
but
sight
of
the
ebony
sky
with
its
fields
of
strewn
jewels
had
in
the
end
tended
to
make
him
moody
he
spent
most
of
the
second
day
dozing
nagel
kept
busy
prowling
through
the
oxygen
gear
testing
connections
and
making
minor
adjustments
his
seeming
concern
with
the
equipment
bothered
crag
the
narrow
escape
with
the
time
bomb
had
robbed
him
of
his
confidence
in
the
crew
he
told
himself
the
bomb
could
have
been
planted
during
the
last
security
shakedown
but
a
sleeper
in
security
seemed
highly
unlikely
so
did
a
sleeper
in
the
aztec
everyone
of
them
he
knew
had
been
scanned
under
the
finest
security
microscope
almost
from
birth
to
the
moment
each
had
climbed
the
tall
ladder
leading
to
the
space
cabin
he
covertly
watched
nagel
wondering
if
his
prowling
was
a
form
of
escape
an
effort
to
forget
his
fears
he
was
beginning
to
understand
the
stark
reality
of
nagel
terror
it
had
been
mirrored
in
his
face
a
naked
horrible
dread
during
the
recent
emergency
no
he
was
the
saboteur
type
larkwell
maybe
perhaps
prochaska
but
not
nagel
a
saboteur
would
have
iron
nerves
a
cold
icy
fanaticism
that
never
considered
danger
but
supposing
the
man
were
a
consummate
actor
his
fear
a
mask
to
conceal
his
purpose
he
debated
the
pros
and
cons
in
the
end
he
decided
it
would
not
be
politic
to
forbid
nagel
to
handle
the
gear
during
flight
he
was
after
all
their
oxygen
equipment
specialist
he
contented
himself
with
keeping
a
sharp
watch
on
nagel
activities
a
situation
nagel
seemed
unmindful
of
he
seemed
to
have
lost
some
of
his
earlier
fear
his
face
was
alert
almost
cheerful
at
times
yet
it
held
the
attitude
of
watchful
waiting
despite
his
liking
for
prochaska
crag
could
forget
that
he
had
failed
to
find
the
time
bomb
in
a
panel
he
had
twice
searched
still
the
console
complex
maze
of
wiring
and
tubes
had
made
an
excellent
hiding
place
he
had
to
admit
he
was
lucky
to
have
found
it
himself
he
tried
to
push
his
suspicions
from
his
mind
without
relaxing
his
vigilance
it
was
a
hard
job
by
the
third
day
the
enemy
missile
had
become
a
prime
factor
in
the
things
he
found
to
worry
about
the
intruder
rocket
had
drawn
closer
alpine
warned
that
the
race
was
neck
and
neck
it
had
either
escaped
earth
at
a
higher
speed
or
had
continued
to
accelerate
beyond
the
escape
point
crag
regarded
the
reason
as
purely
academic
the
hard
fact
was
that
it
would
eventually
overtake
the
still
decelerating
aztec
just
now
it
was
a
pip
on
the
analog
a
pip
which
before
long
would
loom
as
large
as
drone
able
perhaps
as
close
he
tried
to
assess
its
meaning
vexed
that
alpine
seemed
to
be
doing
so
little
to
help
in
the
matter
later
larkwell
spotted
the
pip
made
by
the
east
rocket
on
the
scope
that
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
as
far
as
crag
was
concerned
soberly
he
informed
them
of
its
origin
larkwell
bit
his
lip
thoughtfully
nagel
furrowed
his
brow
seemingly
lost
in
contemplation
expression
never
changed
crag
assessed
each
reaction
in
fairness
he
also
assessed
his
own
feeling
toward
each
of
the
men
he
felt
a
positive
dislike
of
nagel
and
a
positive
liking
for
prochaska
larkwell
was
a
neutral
he
seemed
to
be
a
congenial
man
who
wore
his
feelings
in
plain
sight
but
there
was
a
quality
about
him
which
try
as
he
would
he
could
not
put
his
finger
on
nagel
he
told
himself
must
have
plenty
on
the
ball
after
all
he
had
passed
through
a
tough
selection
board
just
because
the
personality
conflicted
with
his
own
was
no
grounds
for
suspicion
but
the
same
reasoning
could
apply
to
the
others
the
fact
remained
at
least
gotch
seemed
certain
that
his
crew
numbered
a
ringer
among
them
he
was
mulling
it
over
when
the
communicator
came
to
life
the
message
was
in
moon
code
it
came
slowly
widely
spaced
as
if
gotch
realized
crag
limitations
in
handling
the
intricate
cipher
system
evolved
especially
for
this
one
operation
learning
it
had
caused
him
many
a
sleepless
night
he
copied
the
message
letter
by
letter
his
understanding
blanked
by
the
effort
to
decipher
it
he
finished
then
quickly
read
the
two
scant
lines
channel
to
alp
unless
survival
he
studied
the
message
for
a
long
moment
gotch
was
telling
him
not
to
contact
alpine
base
unless
it
were
a
life
or
death
matter
not
that
everything
connected
with
the
operation
was
a
life
or
death
matter
he
thought
grimly
he
decided
the
message
was
connected
with
the
presence
of
the
rocket
now
riding
astern
and
to
one
side
of
the
aztec
and
her
drone
he
guessed
the
moon
code
had
been
used
to
prevent
possible
pickup
by
the
intruder
rather
than
any
secrecy
involving
his
own
crew
he
quietly
passed
the
information
to
prochaska
the
chief
listened
nodding
his
eyes
going
to
the
analog
according
to
his
computations
the
enemy
rocket
prochaska
had
dubbed
it
bandit
would
pass
abeam
of
drone
able
slightly
after
they
entered
the
moon
gravitational
field
about
miles
above
the
surface
then
what
he
pursed
his
lips
vexedly
bandit
was
a
factor
that
had
to
be
considered
but
just
how
he
did
know
one
thing
was
certain
the
east
knew
about
the
load
of
uranium
in
crater
arzachel
that
then
was
the
destination
of
the
other
rocket
among
the
many
x
unknowns
he
had
to
solve
a
new
x
had
been
added
the
rocket
from
behind
the
iron
curtain
something
told
him
this
would
be
the
biggest
x
of
all
chapter
if
colonel
michael
gotch
were
worried
he
did
show
it
he
puffed
complacently
on
his
black
briar
pipe
watching
and
listening
to
the
man
across
from
him
his
visitor
was
angular
about
sixty
with
hair
and
eyes
a
livid
scar
bit
deep
into
his
forehead
his
mouth
was
a
cold
thin
slash
in
his
face
he
wore
the
uniform
of
a
major
general
in
the
united
states
air
force
the
uniform
did
not
denote
the
fact
that
its
wearer
was
military
intelligence
his
name
was
leonard
telford
so
that
the
way
it
looks
general
telford
was
saying
the
enemy
is
out
to
get
arzachel
at
all
costs
failing
that
they
act
to
keep
us
from
it
they
would
risk
war
gotch
stated
calmly
no
but
neither
would
we
that
the
damnable
part
of
it
the
general
agreed
the
next
war
spells
total
annihilation
but
for
that
very
reason
they
can
engage
in
sabotage
and
hostile
acts
with
security
of
knowledge
that
we
wo
go
to
war
look
at
them
now
the
missile
attack
on
the
aztec
the
time
bomb
plant
the
way
they
operate
their
networks
right
in
our
midst
pure
audacity
hell
they
even
got
an
agent
to
the
moon
on
our
rocket
at
that
the
colonel
nodded
uncomfortably
the
presence
of
a
saboteur
on
the
aztec
represented
a
bungle
in
his
department
the
general
was
telling
him
so
in
a
not
too
gentle
way
i
seem
to
recall
i
was
in
astrakhan
myself
a
few
years
back
he
reminded
oh
sure
we
build
pretty
fair
networks
ourselves
the
general
said
blandly
he
looked
at
gotch
and
a
rare
smile
crossed
his
face
how
did
you
like
the
dancing
girls
in
gorik
over
by
the
shore
gotch
looked
startled
then
grinned
did
know
you
ever
been
that
far
in
general
same
time
you
were
well
i
be
damned
gotch
breathed
softly
there
was
a
note
of
respect
in
his
voice
the
general
was
silent
for
a
moment
but
the
caspian
hot
now
meaning
warheads
with
the
name
arzachel
writ
large
across
the
nose
cones
he
eyed
gotch
obliquely
if
we
secure
arzachel
first
they
blow
it
off
the
face
of
the
moon
they
looked
at
each
other
silently
outside
a
jet
engine
roared
to
life
the
moon
filled
the
sky
it
was
gigantic
a
monstrous
sphere
of
cratered
rock
moving
in
the
eternal
silence
of
space
with
heedless
that
a
minute
mote
bearing
alien
life
had
entered
its
gravitational
field
it
moved
in
majesty
along
its
orbit
some
miles
every
hour
alternately
approaching
to
within
miles
of
its
earth
mother
retreating
to
over
miles
measuring
its
strides
by
some
strange
cosmic
clock
the
apennines
a
rugged
mountain
range
jutting
feet
above
the
planet
surface
was
clearly
visible
it
rose
near
the
crater
eratosthenes
running
northwest
some
miles
to
form
the
southwest
boundary
of
mare
imbrium
the
towering
leibnitz
and
dorfel
mountains
were
visible
near
the
edge
of
the
disc
south
along
the
terminator
the
border
between
night
and
day
lay
ptolemaeus
alphons
and
arzachel
crag
and
prochaska
studied
its
surface
picking
out
the
flat
areas
which
early
astronomers
had
mistaken
for
seas
and
which
still
bore
the
names
of
seas
the
giant
enclosure
clavius
the
plato
and
copernicus
held
their
attention
crag
studied
the
line
along
which
arzachel
lay
wondering
again
if
they
could
seek
out
such
a
relatively
small
area
in
the
jumbled
broken
twisted
land
beneath
them
at
some
miles
from
earth
the
aztec
had
decelerated
to
a
little
over
miles
per
hour
shortly
after
entering
the
moon
gravisphere
it
began
to
accelerate
again
crag
studied
the
enemy
rocket
riding
astern
it
would
be
almost
abreast
them
in
short
time
off
to
one
side
of
the
silver
drone
it
too
was
accelerating
going
to
be
nip
and
tuck
he
told
prochaska
the
chief
nodded
do
like
the
looks
of
that
stinker
he
grunted
crag
watched
the
analog
a
moment
longer
before
turning
to
the
quartz
viewport
his
eyes
filled
with
wonder
for
untold
ages
lovers
had
sung
of
the
moon
philosophers
had
pondered
its
mysteries
astronomers
had
scanned
and
mapped
every
visible
mile
of
its
surface
until
selenography
had
achieved
an
exactness
comparable
to
earth
cartography
scientists
had
proved
beyond
doubt
that
the
moon
was
made
of
green
cheese
but
no
human
eye
had
ever
beheld
its
surface
as
crag
was
doing
now
crag
prochaska
larkwell
and
nagel
the
latter
two
were
peering
through
the
side
ports
prochaska
and
crag
shared
the
forward
panel
it
was
a
tribute
to
the
event
that
no
word
was
spoken
aside
from
the
occasional
checks
on
drone
able
and
bandit
the
name
stuck
the
four
pairs
of
eyes
seldom
left
the
satellite
surface
the
landing
plan
called
for
circling
the
moon
during
which
they
were
to
maneuver
drone
able
into
independent
orbit
it
was
crag
job
to
bring
the
aztec
down
at
a
precise
point
in
crater
arzachel
and
the
chief
job
to
handle
the
drone
landings
a
task
as
ticklish
as
landing
the
aztec
itself
the
spot
chosen
for
landing
was
in
an
area
where
the
crater
floor
was
broken
by
a
series
of
rills
wide
shallow
cracks
the
earth
scientists
hoped
would
give
protection
against
the
fall
of
meteorites
due
to
lack
of
atmosphere
the
particles
in
space
ranging
from
dust
grains
to
huge
chunks
of
rock
were
more
lethal
than
bullets
they
were
another
unknown
in
the
gamble
for
the
moon
a
direct
hit
by
even
a
particle
could
puncture
a
space
suit
and
bring
instant
death
a
large
one
could
utterly
destroy
the
rocket
itself
larkwell
job
was
to
construct
an
airlock
in
one
of
the
rills
from
durable
lightweight
prefabricated
plastiblocks
carried
in
the
drones
such
an
airlock
would
protect
them
from
all
but
vertically
falling
meteorites
crag
felt
almost
humble
in
the
face
of
the
task
they
were
undertaking
he
knew
his
mind
alone
could
grasp
but
a
minute
part
of
the
knowledge
that
went
into
making
the
expedition
possible
their
saving
lay
in
the
fact
they
were
but
agents
protoplasmic
extensions
of
a
complex
of
computers
scientists
plans
which
had
taken
years
to
formulate
and
a
man
named
michael
gotch
who
had
said
will
land
on
he
initiated
the
zero
phase
by
ordering
the
crew
into
their
pressure
suits
prochaska
took
over
while
he
donned
his
own
bulky
garment
grimacing
as
he
pulled
the
heavy
helmet
over
his
shoulders
later
in
the
last
moments
of
descent
he
would
snap
down
the
face
plate
and
pressurize
the
suit
until
then
he
wanted
all
the
freedom
the
bulky
garments
would
allow
might
as
well
get
used
to
it
prochaska
grinned
he
flexed
his
arms
experimentally
larkwell
grunted
wait
till
they
pressurized
you
think
rigor
mortis
has
set
in
crag
grinned
that
a
condition
i
opposed
to
amen
larkwell
gave
a
weak
experimental
jump
and
promptly
smacked
his
head
against
the
low
overhead
he
was
smiling
foolishly
when
nagel
snapped
at
him
one
more
of
those
and
you
be
walking
around
the
moon
without
a
pressure
suit
he
peevishly
insisted
on
examining
the
top
of
the
helmet
for
damage
crag
fervently
hoped
they
would
need
the
suits
for
landing
any
damage
that
would
allow
the
aztec
oxygen
to
escape
would
in
itself
be
a
death
sentence
even
though
death
might
be
dragged
over
the
long
period
of
time
it
would
take
to
die
for
lack
of
food
an
intact
space
cabin
represented
the
only
haven
in
which
they
could
escape
from
the
cumbersome
garments
long
enough
to
tend
their
biological
needs
imperceptibly
the
sensation
of
weight
returned
but
it
was
not
the
body
weight
of
earth
even
on
the
moon
surface
they
would
weigh
but
their
normal
weight
skipper
look
prochaska
startled
exclamation
drew
crag
eyes
to
the
radarscope
bandit
had
made
minute
corrections
in
its
course
they
using
steering
rockets
crag
mused
trying
to
assess
its
meaning
does
make
sense
said
prochaska
they
ca
have
that
kind
of
power
to
spare
they
need
every
bit
they
have
for
landing
what
up
larkwell
peered
over
their
shoulders
eyeing
the
radarscope
crag
bit
off
an
angry
retort
larkwell
sensed
the
rebuff
and
returned
away
they
kept
their
eyes
glued
to
the
scope
bandit
maneuvered
to
a
position
slightly
behind
and
to
one
side
of
the
silver
drone
crag
looked
out
the
side
port
bandit
was
clearly
visible
a
monstrous
cylinder
boring
through
the
void
with
cold
precision
there
was
something
ominous
about
it
he
felt
the
hair
prickle
at
the
nape
of
his
neck
larkwell
moved
alongside
him
bandit
made
another
minute
correction
white
vapor
shot
from
its
tail
and
it
began
to
move
ahead
using
rocket
power
crag
grunted
damn
if
i
can
figure
that
one
out
looks
crazy
to
me
i
should
think
prochaska
voice
froze
a
minute
pip
broke
off
from
bandit
boring
through
space
toward
the
silver
drone
warhead
crag
roared
the
word
with
cold
anger
prochaska
cursed
softly
one
second
drone
able
was
there
riding
serenely
through
space
the
next
it
disintegrated
blasted
apart
by
internal
explosions
seconds
later
only
fragments
of
the
drone
were
visible
prochaska
stared
at
crag
his
face
bleak
crag
brain
reeled
he
mentally
examined
what
had
happened
culling
his
thoughts
until
one
cold
fact
remained
mistaken
identity
he
said
softly
they
thought
it
was
the
aztec
now
what
now
we
hope
they
have
any
more
warheads
crag
mulled
the
possibility
considering
weight
factors
i
guess
they
have
besides
there
no
profit
in
wasting
a
warhead
on
a
drone
we
hope
prochaska
studied
bandit
through
the
port
and
licked
his
lips
nervously
think
we
ought
to
contact
alpine
crag
weighed
the
question
despite
the
tight
beam
any
communication
could
be
a
dead
giveaway
on
the
other
hand
bandit
either
had
the
capacity
to
destroy
them
or
it
did
if
it
did
well
there
much
they
could
do
about
it
he
reached
a
decision
and
nodded
to
prochaska
then
began
coding
his
thoughts
he
had
trouble
getting
through
on
the
communicator
finally
he
got
a
weak
return
signal
then
sent
a
brief
report
alpine
acknowledged
and
cut
off
the
air
what
now
prochaska
asked
when
crag
had
finished
he
shrugged
and
turned
to
the
side
port
without
answering
bandit
loomed
large
a
long
thick
rocket
with
an
oddly
blunted
nose
a
monster
that
was
as
deadly
as
it
looked
big
he
surmised
much
bigger
than
this
chunk
of
hardware
yeah
a
regular
battleship
prochaska
assented
he
grinned
crookedly
in
more
ways
than
one
crag
sensed
movement
at
his
shoulder
and
turned
his
head
nagel
was
studying
the
radarscope
over
his
shoulder
surprise
lit
his
narrow
face
the
drone
destroyed
crag
said
bruskly
bandit
had
a
warhead
nagel
looked
startled
then
retreated
to
his
seat
without
a
word
crag
returned
his
attention
to
the
enemy
rocket
what
do
you
think
he
asked
prochaska
his
answer
was
solemn
it
spells
trouble
chapter
at
a
precise
point
in
space
spelled
out
by
the
alpine
computers
crag
applied
the
first
braking
rockets
he
realized
that
the
act
had
been
an
immediate
to
the
occupants
of
the
other
rocket
no
matter
he
thought
sooner
or
later
they
had
to
discover
it
was
the
drone
they
had
destroyed
slowly
almost
imperceptibly
their
headlong
flight
was
slowed
he
nursed
the
rockets
with
care
there
was
no
fuel
to
spare
no
energy
to
waste
no
room
for
error
everything
had
been
worked
out
long
beforehand
he
was
merely
the
agent
of
execution
the
sensation
of
weight
gradually
increased
he
ordered
larkwell
and
nagel
into
their
seats
in
strapdown
position
he
and
prochaska
shortly
followed
but
he
left
his
shoulder
harnessing
loose
to
give
his
arms
the
vital
freedom
he
needed
for
the
intricate
maneuvers
ahead
the
moon
rushed
toward
them
at
an
appalling
rate
its
surface
was
a
harsh
grille
work
of
black
and
white
a
nightmarish
scape
of
pocks
and
twisted
mountains
of
rock
rimming
the
flat
lunar
plains
it
was
he
thought
the
geometry
of
a
maniac
there
was
no
softness
no
blend
of
light
and
shadow
only
terrible
cleavages
between
black
and
white
yet
there
was
a
beauty
that
gripped
his
imagination
the
raw
stark
beauty
of
a
nature
undefiled
by
life
no
eye
had
ever
seen
the
canopy
of
the
heavens
from
the
bleak
surface
below
no
flower
had
ever
wafted
in
a
lunar
breeze
prochaska
nudged
his
arm
and
indicated
the
scope
bandit
was
almost
abreast
them
crag
nodded
understandingly
no
more
warheads
guess
we
just
loaded
with
luck
prochaska
agreed
wryly
they
watched
waited
mindless
of
time
crag
felt
the
tension
building
inside
him
occasionally
he
glanced
at
the
chronometer
itching
for
action
the
wait
seemed
interminable
minutes
or
hours
he
lost
track
of
time
all
at
once
his
hands
and
mind
were
busy
with
the
braking
rockets
dials
meters
first
the
moon
had
been
a
pallid
giant
in
the
sky
next
it
filled
the
horizon
the
effect
was
startling
the
limb
of
the
moon
seen
as
a
shallow
curved
horizon
no
longer
was
smooth
it
appeared
as
a
rugged
arc
somehow
reminding
him
of
the
devil
golf
course
in
california
death
valley
it
was
weird
and
wonderful
and
slightly
terrifying
prochaska
manned
the
automatic
camera
to
record
the
orbital
and
landing
phases
he
spotted
the
crater
of
ptolemaeus
first
near
the
of
the
disc
crag
made
a
minute
correction
with
the
steering
rockets
the
enemy
rocket
followed
suit
prochaska
gave
a
short
harsh
laugh
without
humor
looks
like
we
piloting
them
in
jeepers
you
think
they
could
do
their
own
navigation
shows
the
confidence
they
have
in
us
crag
retorted
they
flashed
high
above
ptolemaeus
a
crater
ninety
miles
in
diameter
rimmed
by
walls
three
thousand
feet
high
the
crater
fled
by
below
them
south
lay
alphons
and
farther
south
arzachel
with
walls
ten
thousand
feet
high
rimming
its
vast
depressed
interior
prochaska
observed
quietly
nice
rugged
spot
it
going
to
take
some
doing
amen
i
beginning
to
get
that
feeling
i
had
it
right
along
crag
confided
they
caught
only
a
fleeting
look
at
arzachel
before
it
rushed
into
the
background
crag
touched
the
braking
rockets
from
time
to
time
gently
precisely
keeping
his
eyes
moving
between
the
radar
altimeter
and
speed
indicator
while
the
chief
fed
him
the
course
data
the
back
side
of
the
moon
was
spinning
into
view
the
side
of
the
moon
never
before
seen
by
human
eyes
prochaska
whistled
softly
a
huge
mountain
range
interlaced
with
valleys
and
chasms
pushed
some
thirty
thousand
feet
into
the
lunar
skies
long
streaks
of
ochre
and
brown
marked
its
sides
the
first
color
they
had
seen
on
the
moon
flat
highland
plains
crested
between
the
peaks
were
dotted
with
strange
monolithic
structures
almost
geometrical
in
their
distribution
prochaska
was
shooting
the
scene
with
the
automatic
camera
crag
twisted
around
several
times
to
nod
reassuringly
to
nagel
and
larkwell
but
each
time
they
were
occupied
with
the
side
ports
oblivious
of
his
gesture
to
his
surprise
nagel
face
was
rapt
almost
dreamy
completely
absorbed
by
the
stark
lands
below
larkwell
too
was
quiet
with
wonder
the
jagged
mountains
fell
away
to
a
great
sea
larger
even
than
mare
imbrium
and
like
mare
imbrium
devoid
of
life
a
huge
crater
rose
from
its
center
towering
over
twenty
thousand
feet
beyond
lay
more
mountains
the
land
between
was
a
wild
tangle
of
rock
a
place
of
unutterable
desolation
crag
was
fascinated
and
depressed
at
the
same
time
the
aztec
was
closing
around
the
moon
in
a
tight
spiral
the
alien
landscape
drew
visibly
nearer
he
switched
his
attention
between
the
braking
rockets
and
instruments
trying
to
manage
a
quick
glance
at
the
scope
prochaska
caught
his
look
bandit
up
on
us
he
confirmed
crag
uttered
a
vile
epithet
and
prochaska
grinned
he
liked
to
hear
him
growl
taking
it
as
a
good
sign
crag
glanced
worriedly
at
the
radar
altimeter
and
hit
the
braking
rockets
harder
the
quick
deceleration
gave
the
impression
of
added
weight
pushing
them
hard
against
their
chest
harnesses
he
found
it
difficult
to
make
the
precise
hand
movements
required
the
aztec
was
dropping
with
frightening
rapidity
they
crossed
more
mountains
seas
craters
great
chasms
time
had
become
meaningless
had
ceased
to
exist
the
sheer
bleakness
of
the
face
of
the
moon
gripped
his
imagination
he
saw
it
as
the
supreme
challenge
the
magnitude
of
which
took
his
breath
he
was
cortez
scanning
the
land
of
the
aztecs
more
for
this
stark
lonely
terrain
had
never
felt
the
stir
of
life
no
benevolent
maker
had
created
this
chaos
it
was
an
inferno
without
fire
a
hell
of
a
kind
never
known
on
earth
it
was
the
handiwork
of
a
nature
on
a
rampage
a
maddened
nature
whose
molding
clay
had
been
molten
lava
he
stirred
the
controls
moved
them
further
holding
hard
the
braking
rockets
shook
the
ship
coming
through
the
bulkheads
as
a
faint
roar
the
ground
came
up
fast
still
the
landscape
fled
by
fled
past
for
seeming
days
prochaska
announced
wonderingly
we
cleared
the
back
side
you
on
the
landing
run
skipper
crag
nodded
grimly
thinking
it
was
going
to
be
rough
each
second
each
split
second
had
to
be
considered
there
was
no
margin
for
error
no
second
chance
he
checked
and
his
instruments
juggling
speed
against
altitude
wide
ptolemaeus
was
coming
around
again
fast
he
caught
a
glimpse
through
the
floor
port
it
was
a
huge
saucer
level
at
the
bottom
rimmed
by
low
cliffs
which
looked
as
though
they
had
been
carved
from
obsidian
the
floor
was
split
by
irregular
chasms
punctuated
by
sharp
high
pinnacles
it
receded
and
alphons
rushed
to
meet
them
the
aztec
was
dropping
fast
too
fast
crag
looked
worriedly
at
the
radar
altimeter
and
hit
the
braking
rockets
harder
alphons
passed
more
slowly
they
fled
south
a
slim
needle
in
the
lunar
skies
arzachel
he
breathed
the
name
almost
reverently
prochaska
glanced
out
the
side
port
before
hurriedly
consulting
the
instruments
thirty
thousand
feet
he
glanced
worriedly
at
crag
the
ground
passed
below
them
at
a
fantastic
speed
they
seemed
to
be
dropping
faster
the
stark
face
of
the
planet
hurtled
to
meet
them
fifteen
thousand
feet
prochaska
crag
nodded
twelve
thousand
ten
eight
the
chief
continued
to
chant
the
altitude
readings
in
a
strained
voice
up
until
then
the
face
of
the
moon
had
seemed
to
rush
toward
the
aztec
all
at
once
it
changed
now
it
was
the
aztec
that
rushed
across
the
hostile
land
rushing
and
dropping
three
thousand
two
thousand
they
flashed
high
above
a
great
cliff
which
fell
away
for
some
ten
thousand
feet
at
its
base
began
the
plain
of
arzachel
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
crag
saw
that
bandit
was
leading
them
but
higher
much
higher
now
it
was
needling
into
the
straight
up
he
gave
a
quick
automatic
instrument
check
the
braking
rockets
were
blasting
hard
he
switched
one
hand
to
the
steering
rockets
zero
minute
was
coming
up
bandit
was
ahead
but
higher
it
could
he
thought
be
a
photo
finish
suddenly
he
remembered
his
face
plate
and
snapped
it
shut
opening
the
oxygen
valve
the
suit
grew
rigid
on
his
body
and
hampered
his
arms
he
cursed
softly
and
looked
sideways
at
prochaska
he
was
having
the
same
difficulty
crag
managed
a
quick
glance
at
larkwell
and
nagel
everything
seemed
okay
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
applied
full
deceleration
with
the
braking
jets
and
simultaneously
began
manipulating
the
steering
rockets
the
ship
vibrated
from
stem
to
stern
the
forward
port
moved
upward
the
face
of
the
moon
swished
past
and
disappeared
bandit
was
lost
to
sight
the
ship
trembled
shuddered
and
gave
a
violent
wrench
crag
was
thrown
forward
the
aztec
began
letting
down
tail
first
it
was
a
sickening
moment
the
braking
rockets
astern
heavy
with
smoke
thundered
through
the
hull
the
smoke
blanketed
out
the
ports
the
cabin
vibrated
he
straightened
the
nose
with
the
steering
rockets
letting
the
ship
fall
in
a
vertical
attitude
tail
first
he
snapped
a
glance
at
the
radar
altimeter
and
punched
a
button
a
servo
mechanism
somewhere
in
the
ship
started
a
small
motor
a
tubular
spidery
metal
framework
was
projected
out
from
the
tail
extending
some
twenty
feet
before
it
locked
into
position
it
was
a
failing
device
intended
to
absorb
the
energy
generated
by
the
landing
impact
prochaska
looked
worriedly
out
the
side
port
crag
followed
his
eyes
small
details
on
the
plain
of
arzachel
loomed
large
pits
cracks
low
ridges
of
rock
suddenly
the
plain
was
an
appalling
reality
rocky
fingers
reached
to
grip
them
he
twisted
his
head
until
he
caught
sight
of
bandit
it
was
moving
down
tail
first
but
it
was
still
high
in
the
sky
too
high
he
thought
he
took
a
fast
look
at
the
radar
altimeter
and
punched
the
full
battery
of
braking
rockets
again
the
force
on
his
body
seemed
unbearable
blood
was
forced
into
his
head
blurring
his
vision
his
ears
buzzed
and
his
spine
seemed
to
be
supporting
some
gigantic
weight
the
pressure
eased
and
the
ground
began
moving
up
more
slowly
the
rockets
were
blasting
steadily
for
a
the
ship
seemed
to
hang
in
followed
by
a
violent
shock
the
cabin
teetered
then
smashed
onto
the
plain
swaying
as
the
framework
projecting
from
the
tail
crumpled
the
shock
drove
them
hard
into
their
seats
they
sat
for
a
moment
before
full
realization
dawned
they
were
down
alive
crag
and
prochaska
simultaneously
began
shucking
their
safety
belts
crag
was
first
he
sprang
to
the
side
port
just
in
time
to
see
the
last
seconds
of
bandit
landing
it
came
down
fast
a
perpendicular
needle
stabbing
toward
the
lunar
surface
flame
spewed
from
its
braking
rockets
white
smoke
enveloped
its
nose
fast
too
fast
he
thought
suddenly
the
flame
licked
out
fuel
error
the
thought
flashed
through
his
mind
the
fuel
bandit
had
wasted
in
space
maneuvering
to
destroy
the
drone
had
left
it
short
the
rocket
seemed
to
hang
in
the
sky
for
a
scant
second
before
it
plummeted
straight
down
smashing
into
the
stark
lunar
landscape
the
chief
had
reached
his
side
just
in
time
to
witness
the
crash
that
all
for
them
he
said
ca
say
i
sorry
serves
damn
well
right
growled
crag
he
became
conscious
of
nagel
and
larkwell
crowding
to
get
a
look
and
obligingly
moved
to
one
side
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
scene
he
tried
to
judge
distance
little
over
two
miles
he
estimated
aloud
you
ca
tell
in
this
vacuum
prochaska
advised
your
eyes
play
you
tricks
wait
i
try
the
scope
a
moment
later
he
turned
admiringly
from
the
instrument
closer
to
three
miles
pretty
good
for
a
green
hand
crag
laughed
a
quiet
laugh
of
and
said
i
could
use
a
little
elbow
room
any
volunteers
liberty
call
prochaska
sang
out
all
ashore
who
going
ashore
the
gals
are
waiting
i
a
little
tired
of
this
sardine
can
myself
larkwell
put
in
let
get
on
our
sunday
duds
and
blow
i
like
to
do
the
town
there
was
a
murmur
of
assent
nagel
who
was
monitoring
the
oxygen
pressure
gauge
spoke
affirmatively
no
leaks
good
crag
said
with
relief
he
took
a
moment
off
to
feel
exultant
but
the
mood
quickly
vanished
there
was
work
ahead
sheer
drudgery
check
suit
pressure
he
ordered
they
waited
a
moment
longer
while
they
tested
pressure
the
interphones
and
adjusted
to
the
lack
of
body
weight
before
crag
moved
toward
the
hatch
prochaska
prompted
them
to
actuate
their
temperature
controls
it
going
to
be
hot
out
there
crag
nodded
checked
his
temperature
dial
and
started
to
open
the
hatch
the
resisted
his
efforts
for
a
moment
he
tested
the
dogs
securing
the
door
several
of
them
appeared
jammed
panic
touched
his
mind
he
braced
his
body
moving
against
one
of
the
lock
levers
with
all
his
strength
it
gave
then
another
he
loosened
the
last
lock
braced
against
the
blast
of
escaping
air
the
hatch
exploded
open
he
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
the
ground
some
twenty
feet
below
the
metal
framework
now
crumpled
below
the
tail
had
done
its
work
it
had
struck
failing
and
in
doing
so
had
absorbed
a
large
amount
of
impact
energy
which
otherwise
would
have
been
absorbed
by
the
body
of
the
rocket
with
possible
damage
to
the
space
cabin
the
aztec
tail
fins
were
buried
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
powdery
ash
the
rocket
was
canted
slightly
but
he
thought
not
dangerously
so
larkwell
broke
out
the
rope
ladder
provided
for
descent
and
was
looking
busy
now
it
was
his
turn
to
shine
he
hooked
the
ladder
over
two
pegs
and
let
the
other
end
fall
to
the
ground
he
tested
it
then
straightened
up
and
turned
to
crag
you
may
depart
sire
crag
grinned
and
started
down
the
ladder
it
was
clumsy
work
the
bulk
and
rigidity
of
his
suit
made
his
movements
uncertain
difficult
he
descended
slowly
testing
each
step
he
hesitated
at
the
last
rung
thinking
is
it
he
let
his
foot
dangle
above
the
surface
for
a
moment
before
plunging
it
down
into
the
soft
ash
mantle
then
walked
a
few
feet
ankle
deep
in
a
fine
gray
powder
first
human
foot
to
touch
the
moon
he
thought
the
first
human
foot
ever
to
step
beyond
the
world
yeah
the
human
race
was
on
the
way
led
by
adam
philip
crag
he
felt
good
it
occurred
to
him
then
that
he
was
not
the
real
victor
that
honor
belonged
to
a
man
miles
away
gotch
had
won
the
moon
it
had
been
the
colonel
who
had
directed
the
conquest
he
crag
was
merely
a
foot
soldier
just
one
of
the
troops
all
at
once
he
felt
humble
prochaska
came
down
next
followed
by
nagel
larkwell
was
last
they
stood
in
a
looking
at
each
other
awed
by
the
thing
they
had
done
no
one
spoke
they
shifted
their
eyes
outward
hungrily
over
the
plain
marveling
at
the
world
they
had
inherited
it
was
a
bleak
hostile
world
encompassed
in
a
bowl
whose
vast
depressed
interior
alternately
was
burned
and
frozen
by
turn
to
their
north
the
rim
of
arzachel
towered
ten
thousand
feet
falling
away
as
it
curved
over
the
horizon
to
the
east
and
west
the
plain
to
the
south
was
a
flat
expanse
of
gray
punctuated
by
occasional
rocky
knolls
and
weird
pinnacles
some
of
which
towered
to
awesome
heights
southeast
a
long
narrow
spur
of
rock
rose
and
crawled
over
the
floor
of
the
crater
for
several
miles
before
it
dipped
again
into
its
ashy
bed
crag
calculated
that
a
beeline
to
bandit
would
just
about
skirt
the
southeast
end
of
the
spur
another
rock
formation
dominated
the
of
the
plain
to
the
south
it
rose
curving
over
the
crater
floor
like
the
spinal
column
of
some
gigantic
lizard
a
great
crescent
with
its
horns
pointed
toward
their
present
position
prochaska
promptly
dubbed
it
backbone
ridge
a
name
that
stuck
crag
suddenly
remembered
what
he
had
to
do
and
coughed
meaningfully
into
his
lip
mike
the
group
fell
silent
he
faced
the
distant
northern
cliffs
and
began
to
speak
i
adam
crag
by
the
authority
vested
in
me
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
of
america
do
hereby
claim
this
land
and
all
the
lands
of
the
moon
as
legal
territory
of
the
united
states
of
america
to
be
a
dominion
of
the
united
states
of
america
subject
to
its
government
and
laws
when
he
finished
he
was
quiet
for
a
minute
for
the
record
this
is
pickering
field
i
think
he
like
that
he
added
there
was
a
lump
in
his
throat
prochaska
said
quietly
gotch
will
like
it
too
had
we
better
record
that
and
transmit
it
to
alpine
it
already
recorded
crag
grinned
all
but
the
pickering
field
part
gotch
wrote
it
out
himself
confident
bastard
larkwell
smiled
he
had
a
lot
more
faith
than
i
did
especially
the
way
you
brought
that
stovepipe
down
nagel
interjected
there
was
a
moment
of
startled
silence
prochaska
said
coldly
i
hope
you
do
your
job
as
well
nagel
looked
provocatively
at
him
but
did
reply
larkwell
had
been
studying
the
terrain
wish
able
had
made
it
he
said
wistfully
i
like
to
get
started
on
that
airlock
it
going
to
be
a
honey
to
build
amen
crag
swept
his
eyes
over
the
ashy
surface
the
scientists
figure
that
falling
meteorites
may
be
our
biggest
hazard
not
if
we
follow
the
plan
of
building
our
airlock
in
a
rill
larkwell
interjected
then
the
only
danger
would
be
from
stuff
coming
straight
down
agreed
but
the
fact
remains
that
we
lost
able
we
have
to
chance
living
in
the
aztec
until
drone
baker
arrives
if
it
makes
it
it
make
it
crag
answered
with
certainty
their
safe
landing
had
boosted
his
confidence
they
land
baker
and
charlie
in
that
order
he
thought
they
locate
a
shallow
rill
then
they
build
an
airlock
to
protect
them
against
chance
meteorites
that
the
way
they
do
it
one
two
three
we
got
it
whipped
prochaska
observed
but
his
voice
did
hold
the
certainty
of
his
words
crag
said
i
was
wondering
if
we
could
assess
the
danger
it
might
not
be
so
great
how
prochaska
asked
curiously
no
wind
no
air
no
external
forces
to
disturb
the
ash
mantle
except
for
meteorites
any
strike
would
leave
a
trace
we
might
smooth
off
a
given
area
and
check
for
hits
after
a
couple
of
days
that
would
give
some
idea
of
the
danger
he
faced
prochaska
what
do
you
think
but
the
ash
itself
is
meteorite
dust
he
protested
we
could
at
least
chart
the
big
hits
those
large
enough
to
damage
the
rocket
we
know
if
any
hit
larkwell
prophesied
grimly
maybe
not
nagel
cut
in
supposing
it
pinhole
size
the
air
could
seep
out
and
we
would
know
it
until
too
late
crag
said
decisively
that
means
we
have
to
maintain
a
watch
over
the
pressure
gauge
that
wo
help
if
it
a
big
chunk
prochaska
scraped
his
toe
through
the
ash
the
possibility
sort
of
disconcerting
too
damned
many
occupational
hazards
for
me
larkwell
ventured
i
must
have
had
rocks
in
my
head
when
i
volunteered
for
this
one
all
brawn
and
no
brain
crag
gave
a
wry
smile
that
the
kind
of
fodder
that
needed
for
deep
space
prochaska
said
we
ought
to
let
gotch
know
he
just
acquired
a
few
more
acres
right
crag
hesitated
a
moment
then
we
check
out
on
bandit
why
larkwell
asked
there
might
be
some
survivors
let
them
rot
nagel
growled
that
for
me
to
decide
crag
said
coldly
he
stared
hard
at
the
oxygen
man
we
still
human
nagel
snapped
they
damned
murderers
that
no
reason
we
should
be
crag
turned
back
toward
the
ladder
when
he
reached
it
he
paused
and
looked
skyward
the
sun
was
a
precise
circle
of
intolerable
white
light
set
amid
the
ebony
of
space
the
stars
seemed
very
close
the
space
cabin
was
a
vacuum
at
nagel
suggestion
they
kept
pressure
to
a
minimum
to
preserve
oxygen
when
they
were
out
of
their
suits
prochaska
got
on
the
radio
he
had
difficulty
raising
alpine
base
working
for
several
minutes
before
he
got
an
answering
signal
when
the
connection
was
made
crag
moved
into
prochaska
place
and
switched
to
his
ear
insert
microphone
he
listened
to
the
faint
slightly
metallic
voice
for
a
moment
before
he
identified
it
as
gotch
he
thought
old
man
must
be
living
in
the
radio
he
adjusted
his
headset
and
sent
a
lengthy
report
if
gotch
were
jubilant
over
the
fruition
of
his
dream
he
carefully
concealed
it
he
congratulated
crag
and
the
crew
speaking
in
precise
formal
terms
and
almost
immediately
launched
into
a
barrage
of
questions
regarding
their
next
step
the
colonel
reaction
nettled
him
lord
he
should
be
jubilant
jumping
with
joy
waltzing
the
telephone
gal
instead
he
was
speaking
with
a
manner
gotch
left
it
up
to
crag
on
whether
or
not
to
attempt
a
rescue
expedition
but
not
if
it
endangers
the
expedition
in
any
way
he
added
he
informed
him
that
drone
baker
had
been
launched
without
mishap
just
be
ready
for
her
he
cautioned
and
again
congratulations
commander
there
was
a
pause
i
think
pickering
field
is
a
fitting
name
the
voice
in
the
earphones
died
away
and
crag
found
himself
listening
to
the
static
of
space
he
pulled
the
sets
off
and
turned
to
nagel
how
much
oxygen
would
a
man
need
for
a
round
trip
to
bandit
assuming
a
total
distance
of
seven
miles
it
not
that
far
prochaska
reminded
there
might
be
detours
nagel
calculated
rapidly
an
extra
cylinder
would
do
it
okay
larkwell
and
i
go
you
and
prochaska
stand
by
crag
caught
the
surprised
look
on
the
chief
face
there
might
be
communication
problems
he
explained
privately
he
had
decided
that
no
man
would
be
left
alone
until
the
mystery
of
the
time
bomb
was
cleared
up
prochaska
nodded
the
arrangement
made
sense
nagel
appeared
pleased
that
he
did
have
to
make
the
long
trek
larkwell
on
the
other
hand
seemed
glad
to
have
been
chosen
chapter
there
is
no
dawn
on
the
moon
no
dusk
no
atmosphere
to
catch
and
spread
the
light
of
the
sun
when
the
lunar
night
ends
a
night
two
earth
weeks
long
the
sun
simply
pops
over
the
horizon
bringing
its
intolerable
heat
but
the
sky
remains
black
black
and
sprinkled
with
stars
agleam
with
a
light
unknown
on
earth
at
night
the
temperature
is
degrees
below
zero
by
day
it
is
the
heat
of
boiling
water
yet
the
sun
is
but
an
intense
circle
of
white
aloft
in
a
nigrescent
sky
it
was
a
world
such
as
crag
had
scarcely
dreamed
of
alien
hostile
fantastic
in
its
architecture
a
bizarre
world
spawned
by
a
nature
in
revolt
crag
stopped
to
adjust
the
temperature
control
on
his
suit
he
started
to
mop
his
brow
before
he
remembered
the
helmet
larkwell
saw
the
gesture
and
behind
his
thick
face
plate
his
lips
wrinkled
in
a
grin
go
on
scratch
it
he
challenged
this
moon
going
to
take
a
lot
of
getting
used
to
crag
swept
his
eyes
over
the
bleak
plain
and
they
send
four
men
to
conquer
this
it
ai
conquered
yet
larkwell
spat
crag
answer
was
a
sober
reflection
no
it
is
he
said
quietly
he
contemplated
the
sky
its
magic
lanterns
then
looked
down
again
at
the
plain
let
get
moving
it
was
dawn
dawn
in
the
sense
that
the
sun
had
climbed
above
the
horizon
the
landing
had
been
planned
for
sunup
the
line
which
divided
night
from
day
to
give
them
the
benefit
of
a
day
before
another
instantaneous
onslaught
of
night
they
moved
slowly
across
the
ashy
floor
of
the
crater
occasionally
circling
small
knolls
or
jagged
rock
outcroppings
despite
the
cumbersome
suits
and
the
burden
of
the
extra
oxygen
cylinder
each
carried
they
made
good
time
crag
led
the
way
with
larkwell
close
behind
threading
his
way
toward
the
spot
where
the
enemy
rocket
had
fallen
from
the
sky
they
had
to
stop
several
times
to
rest
and
regulate
their
temperature
controls
despite
the
protective
garments
they
were
soon
sweating
and
panting
gasping
for
breath
with
the
feeling
of
suffocation
crag
felt
the
water
trickling
down
his
body
in
rivulets
and
began
to
itch
a
sensation
that
was
almost
a
pain
it
not
going
to
be
a
picnic
larkwell
complained
his
voice
sounded
exhausted
in
the
earphones
crag
grunted
without
answering
his
feet
ploughed
up
little
spurts
of
dust
which
fell
as
quickly
as
they
rose
like
water
dropping
he
thought
he
wondered
how
long
they
would
be
able
to
endure
the
heat
could
they
possibly
adapt
their
bodies
to
such
an
environment
what
of
the
cold
of
night
the
questions
bothered
him
he
tried
to
visualize
what
it
would
be
like
to
plunge
from
boiling
day
to
the
bitterly
cold
night
within
the
space
of
moments
would
they
be
able
to
take
it
he
grinned
to
himself
they
find
out
at
the
next
halt
they
looked
back
at
the
aztec
we
do
seem
to
be
getting
anywhere
larkwell
observed
crag
contemplated
the
rocket
he
was
right
the
ship
seemed
almost
as
large
and
clear
as
ever
your
eyes
trick
you
he
said
it
just
another
thing
we
have
to
get
used
to
he
let
his
eyes
linger
on
the
plain
it
was
washed
with
a
brilliant
light
which
even
their
glare
shields
did
diminish
each
rock
each
outcrop
cast
long
black
shadows
black
silhouettes
against
the
white
ash
there
were
no
grays
no
intermediate
shades
everything
was
either
black
or
white
his
eyes
began
to
ache
and
he
turned
them
from
the
scene
he
nodded
at
larkwell
and
resumed
his
trek
he
was
trudging
head
down
when
he
suddenly
stopped
a
chasm
yawned
at
his
feet
mighty
wide
larkwell
observed
coming
up
yeah
said
crag
indecisively
the
rift
was
about
twenty
feet
wide
its
bottom
lost
in
black
shadows
larkwell
studied
the
chasm
carefully
might
be
just
the
rill
we
need
for
an
airlock
if
it
not
too
deep
he
added
he
picked
up
a
boulder
and
dropped
it
over
the
edge
waiting
expectantly
crag
chuckled
the
construction
man
had
forgotten
that
sound
could
be
transmitted
through
a
vacuum
larkwell
caught
the
laugh
in
his
earphones
and
smiled
weakly
he
said
sheepishly
something
else
to
learn
we
plenty
to
learn
crag
looked
both
ways
to
the
right
the
chasm
seemed
to
narrow
and
although
he
was
sure
end
let
try
it
he
suggested
larkwell
nodded
agreement
they
trudged
along
the
edge
of
the
fissure
walking
slowly
to
conserve
their
energy
the
plain
became
more
uneven
small
outcroppings
of
black
glassy
rock
punctured
the
ash
becoming
more
numerous
as
they
progressed
occasional
needles
pierced
the
sky
several
times
they
stopped
and
looked
back
at
the
aztec
it
was
a
black
cylinder
smaller
yet
seemingly
close
crag
guess
was
right
the
chasm
narrowed
abruptly
and
terminated
at
the
base
of
a
small
knoll
both
rockets
were
now
hidden
by
intervening
rocks
he
hesitated
before
striking
out
keeping
backbone
ridge
to
his
right
the
ground
became
progressively
more
uneven
they
trudged
onward
for
over
a
mile
before
he
caught
sight
of
the
aztec
again
he
paused
with
the
feeling
something
was
wrong
larkwell
put
it
into
words
lost
not
lost
but
off
course
crag
took
a
moment
to
get
his
bearings
and
then
struck
out
again
thinking
their
oxygen
supply
could
stand
many
of
these
mistakes
how
you
doing
skipper
crag
gave
a
start
before
remembering
that
prochaska
and
nagel
were
cut
into
their
intercom
lousy
he
told
them
he
gave
a
brief
just
happened
to
think
that
i
could
help
guide
you
i
work
you
with
the
scope
prochaska
said
of
course
crag
exclaimed
wondering
why
they
had
thought
of
it
before
one
thing
was
certain
they
have
to
start
remembering
a
lot
of
things
thereafter
they
checked
with
prochaska
every
few
minutes
the
ground
constantly
changed
as
they
progressed
one
moment
it
was
level
dusty
with
ash
the
next
it
was
broken
by
low
rocky
ridges
and
interlacing
chasms
minutes
extended
into
seeming
hours
and
they
had
to
stop
for
rest
from
time
to
time
crag
was
leading
the
way
across
a
small
ravine
when
larkwell
voice
brought
him
up
short
commander
we
forgetting
something
what
radcounters
mine
whispering
a
tune
i
did
like
not
a
thing
to
worry
about
crag
assured
him
the
raw
ores
that
potent
nevertheless
he
unhooked
his
counter
and
studied
it
larkwell
was
right
they
were
on
hot
ground
but
the
count
was
low
wo
bother
us
a
bit
he
affirmed
cheerfully
larkwell
answer
was
a
grunt
crag
checked
the
instrument
several
times
thinking
that
before
long
when
they
were
settled
they
would
mark
off
the
boundaries
of
the
lode
gotch
would
want
that
the
count
rose
slightly
once
he
caught
larkwell
nervously
consulting
his
meter
clearly
the
construction
boss
was
too
happy
over
their
position
crag
wanted
to
tell
him
he
had
been
reading
too
many
sunday
supplements
but
did
prochaska
broke
in
you
getting
close
his
voice
was
a
faint
whisper
over
the
phones
maybe
you
better
make
a
cautious
approach
crag
remembered
the
fate
of
drone
able
and
silently
agreed
thereafter
he
kept
his
eyes
peeled
they
climbed
a
small
knoll
and
saw
bandit
he
abruptly
halted
waiting
until
larkwell
reached
his
side
the
rocket
lay
at
the
base
of
the
slope
which
fell
away
before
them
it
was
careened
at
a
crazy
angle
with
its
base
crumpled
a
wide
cleft
running
half
way
to
its
nose
was
visible
crag
studied
the
rocket
carefully
might
still
be
oxygen
in
the
space
cabin
he
ventured
finally
the
break
in
the
hull
might
not
reach
that
far
it
does
larkwell
corrected
his
eyes
trained
in
construction
work
had
noted
small
cracks
in
the
metal
extending
up
alongside
the
hatch
no
survivors
in
there
he
grunted
crag
said
thoughtfully
might
be
if
they
had
on
their
pressure
suits
and
they
would
have
he
added
he
hesitated
before
striking
across
the
clearing
then
began
moving
down
the
slope
larkwell
followed
slowly
as
he
neared
the
rocket
crag
saw
that
it
lacked
any
type
of
failing
device
to
absorb
the
landing
impact
that
at
least
had
been
one
secret
kept
he
thought
he
was
wondering
how
to
get
into
the
space
cabin
when
larkwell
solved
the
problem
he
drew
a
thin
hemp
line
from
a
leg
pocket
and
began
uncoiling
it
crag
smiled
approval
never
without
one
in
the
construction
business
he
explained
he
studied
bandit
maybe
i
can
hook
it
over
the
top
of
that
busted
tail
fin
then
work
my
way
up
the
break
in
the
hull
let
me
try
crag
offered
the
climb
looked
hazardous
this
is
my
province
larkwell
snorted
he
ran
his
eye
over
the
ship
before
casting
the
line
he
looked
surprised
when
it
shot
high
above
the
intended
target
point
keep
forgetting
the
low
gravity
he
apologized
he
tried
again
on
the
third
throw
he
hooked
the
line
over
the
torn
tailfin
he
rubbed
his
hands
against
his
suit
then
started
upward
climbing
clumsily
each
movement
exaggerated
by
the
bulky
suit
he
progressed
slowly
testing
each
step
crag
held
his
breath
larkwell
gripped
the
line
with
his
body
swung
outward
his
feet
planted
against
the
vertical
metal
reminding
crag
of
a
human
fly
he
stopped
to
rest
just
below
the
level
of
the
space
cabin
thought
a
man
was
supposed
to
be
able
to
jump
thirty
feet
on
the
moon
he
panted
you
can
if
you
peel
those
duds
off
crag
replied
cheerfully
he
ran
his
eye
over
the
break
noting
the
splintered
metal
be
careful
of
your
suit
larkwell
did
answer
he
was
busy
again
trying
to
pull
his
body
upward
using
the
break
in
the
hull
to
obtain
finger
grips
only
the
moon
low
gravity
allowed
him
to
perform
what
looked
like
an
impossible
task
he
finally
reached
a
point
alongside
the
hatch
and
paused
breathing
heavily
he
rested
a
moment
then
carefully
inserted
his
hand
into
the
break
in
the
hull
after
a
moment
he
withdrew
it
and
fumbled
in
his
leg
pocket
withdrawing
a
switchblade
knife
got
to
cut
through
the
lining
he
explained
he
worked
the
knife
around
inside
the
break
for
several
minutes
then
closed
the
blade
and
reinserted
his
hand
feeling
around
until
he
located
the
lockbar
he
tugged
it
did
give
he
braced
his
body
and
exerted
all
of
his
strength
this
time
it
moved
he
rested
a
moment
then
turned
his
attention
to
the
remaining
doglocks
in
short
time
he
had
the
hatch
open
carefully
then
he
pulled
his
body
across
to
the
black
rectangle
and
disappeared
inside
see
anything
crag
shifted
his
feet
restlessly
dead
men
larkwell
voice
sounded
relieved
over
the
phones
smashed
face
plates
there
was
a
long
moment
of
silence
crag
waited
impatiently
just
a
second
he
finally
reported
looks
like
a
live
one
there
was
another
interval
of
silence
while
crag
stewed
finally
he
appeared
in
the
opening
with
a
hemp
ladder
knew
they
had
to
have
some
way
of
getting
out
of
this
trap
he
announced
triumphantly
he
knelt
and
secured
one
end
to
the
hatch
combing
and
let
the
other
end
drop
to
the
ground
crag
climbed
to
meet
him
larkwell
extended
a
hand
and
helped
him
through
the
hatch
one
glance
at
the
interior
of
the
cabin
told
him
that
any
life
left
was
little
short
of
a
miracle
the
man
in
the
pilot
seat
lay
with
his
faceplate
smashed
against
the
instrument
panel
the
top
of
his
fiberglass
helmet
had
shattered
and
the
top
of
his
head
was
a
bloody
mess
a
second
crewman
was
sprawled
over
the
communication
console
with
his
face
smashed
into
the
radarscope
his
suit
had
been
ripped
from
shoulder
to
waist
and
one
leg
was
twisted
at
a
crazy
angle
crag
turned
his
eyes
away
here
larkwell
grunted
he
was
bent
over
the
third
and
last
crewman
who
had
been
strapped
in
a
bucket
seat
immediately
behind
the
pilot
crag
moved
to
his
side
and
looked
down
at
the
recumbent
figure
the
man
suit
seemed
to
have
withstood
the
terrible
impact
his
helmet
looked
intact
and
his
faceplate
was
clouded
prochaska
nodded
affirmatively
breathing
he
said
crag
knelt
and
checked
the
unconscious
man
as
best
he
could
before
finally
getting
back
to
his
feet
it
going
to
be
a
helluva
job
getting
him
back
larkwell
eyes
opened
with
surprise
you
mean
we
going
to
lug
that
bastard
back
to
the
aztec
we
are
larkwell
did
reply
crag
loosened
the
unconscious
man
from
his
harnessing
larkwell
watched
for
a
while
before
stooping
to
help
when
the
last
straps
were
free
they
pulled
him
close
to
the
edge
of
the
hatch
opening
crag
made
a
mental
inventory
of
the
cabin
while
larkwell
unscrewed
two
metal
strips
from
a
bulkhead
and
laced
straps
from
the
safety
harnessing
between
them
making
a
crude
stretcher
crag
opened
a
narrow
panel
built
into
the
rear
bulkhead
and
involuntarily
whistled
into
his
lip
mike
it
contained
two
automatic
rifles
and
a
supply
of
ammunition
larkwell
eyed
the
arms
speculatively
looks
like
they
expected
good
hunting
he
observed
yeah
crag
grimly
agreed
he
slammed
the
metal
panel
shut
and
looked
distastefully
at
the
unconscious
man
i
a
damned
good
notion
to
leave
him
here
that
what
i
was
thinking
crag
debated
and
finally
shrugged
his
shoulders
guess
we
elected
as
angels
of
mercy
well
let
go
yeah
florence
nightingale
larkwell
the
construction
boss
spat
he
looped
a
line
under
the
unconscious
man
arms
and
rolled
him
to
the
brink
of
the
opening
ought
to
shove
him
out
and
let
him
bounce
a
while
he
growled
crag
did
answer
he
ran
the
other
end
of
the
line
around
a
metal
stanchion
and
signaled
larkwell
to
edge
the
inert
figure
through
the
hatch
crag
let
the
line
out
slowly
until
it
became
slack
larkwell
straightened
up
and
leaned
against
the
hatch
combing
with
a
foolish
look
on
his
face
crag
took
one
look
at
his
gaping
expression
oxygen
he
snapped
larkwell
looked
blank
he
seized
the
extra
cylinder
from
his
belt
and
hooked
it
into
larkwell
suit
turning
the
valve
larkwell
started
to
sway
and
almost
fell
through
the
hatch
combing
before
crag
managed
to
pull
him
to
safety
within
moments
comprehension
dawned
on
larkwell
face
crag
quickly
checked
his
own
oxygen
it
was
low
too
low
the
time
they
had
lost
taking
the
wrong
route
the
time
taken
to
open
bandit
hatch
had
upset
nagel
oxygen
calculations
it
was
something
else
to
remember
in
the
future
he
switched
cylinders
then
made
a
rapid
calculation
it
was
evident
they
could
carry
the
injured
man
back
with
the
amount
of
oxygen
remaining
he
got
on
the
interphones
and
outlined
the
problem
to
nagel
try
one
of
bandit
cylinders
he
suggested
they
just
might
fit
no
go
i
already
looked
them
over
he
kicked
the
problem
around
in
his
mind
here
the
routine
he
told
him
you
start
out
to
meet
us
with
a
couple
of
extra
cylinders
we
take
along
a
couple
of
bandit
spares
to
last
this
critter
until
you
can
modify
the
valves
on
his
suit
to
fit
our
equipment
prochaska
can
guide
the
works
okay
roger
prochaska
cut
in
nagel
gave
an
affirmative
grunt
crag
lowered
two
of
bandit
cylinders
and
the
stretcher
to
the
floor
of
the
crater
then
took
a
last
look
around
the
cabin
gotch
he
knew
would
ask
him
a
thousand
technical
questions
regarding
the
construction
equipment
and
provisioning
he
filed
the
mental
pictures
away
for
later
analysis
and
turned
to
larkwell
let
go
they
descended
to
the
plain
and
rolled
the
unconscious
crewman
onto
the
stretcher
crag
grunted
as
he
hoisted
his
end
it
was
going
to
be
easy
the
return
trip
proved
a
nightmare
despite
the
moon
low
surface
gravity
that
of
earth
the
stretcher
seemed
an
intolerable
weight
pulling
at
their
arms
they
trudged
slowly
toward
the
aztec
with
crag
in
the
lead
their
feet
kicking
up
little
fountains
of
dust
before
they
had
gone
half
a
mile
they
were
sweating
profusely
and
their
arms
and
shoulders
ached
under
their
burden
larkwell
walked
silently
steadily
but
his
breath
was
becoming
a
hoarse
pant
in
crag
earphones
the
thought
came
to
crag
that
they
would
make
it
if
by
any
chance
nagel
failed
to
meet
them
but
he
ca
fail
not
with
prochaska
guiding
them
he
thought
they
reached
the
end
of
the
rill
and
stopped
to
rest
crag
checked
his
oxygen
meter
not
good
not
good
at
all
but
he
did
say
anything
to
larkwell
the
construction
boss
swung
his
eyes
morosely
over
the
plain
and
cursed
nine
planets
and
satellites
in
the
solar
system
and
we
had
to
pick
this
dog
he
grumbled
gotch
must
be
crag
sighed
and
picked
up
his
end
of
the
stretcher
when
larkwell
had
followed
suit
they
resumed
their
trek
they
were
moving
around
the
base
of
a
small
knoll
when
larkwell
foot
struck
a
pothole
in
the
ash
and
he
stumbled
he
dropped
the
end
of
the
stretcher
in
trying
to
regain
his
balance
it
struck
hard
against
the
ground
transmitting
the
jolt
to
crag
aching
shoulders
he
lowered
his
end
of
the
stretcher
fearful
the
plow
had
damaged
the
injured
man
helmet
larkwell
watched
unsympathetically
while
he
examined
it
wo
make
much
difference
he
said
crag
managed
a
weak
grin
remember
we
angels
of
mercy
yeah
carrying
lucifer
the
helmet
proved
intact
crag
sighed
and
signaled
to
move
on
they
hoisted
the
stretcher
and
resumed
their
slow
trek
toward
the
aztec
crag
body
itched
from
perspiration
his
face
was
hot
flushed
and
his
heart
thudded
in
his
ears
larkwell
breathing
became
a
harsh
rasp
in
the
interphones
occasionally
prochaska
checked
their
progress
crag
thought
nagel
was
making
damned
poor
time
he
looked
at
his
oxygen
meter
several
times
finally
beginning
to
worry
larkwell
put
his
fears
into
words
we
better
drop
this
character
and
light
out
for
the
aztec
he
growled
we
not
going
to
make
it
this
way
nagel
should
reach
us
soon
soon
wo
be
soon
enough
nagel
get
on
the
ball
crag
snapped
curtly
into
the
interphones
moving
right
along
the
oxygen
man
voice
was
a
flat
imperturbed
twang
crag
fought
to
keep
his
temper
under
control
nagel
calm
was
maddening
but
it
was
their
necks
that
were
in
danger
he
repressed
his
anger
wondering
again
at
the
wisdom
of
trying
to
save
the
enemy
crewman
if
he
lived
in
short
time
larkwell
was
grumbling
again
he
was
on
the
point
of
telling
him
to
shut
up
when
nagel
appeared
in
the
distance
he
was
moving
slowly
stooped
under
the
weight
of
the
spare
oxygen
cylinders
he
appeared
somewhat
like
an
ungainly
robot
moving
with
mechanical
steps
the
movements
of
a
machine
rather
than
a
man
crag
kept
his
eyes
on
him
nagel
never
faltered
never
changed
pace
his
figure
grew
steadily
nearer
a
dark
mechanical
blob
against
the
gray
ash
crag
suddenly
realized
that
nagel
was
stalling
he
simply
lacked
the
strength
for
what
was
expected
of
him
somehow
the
knowledge
added
to
his
despair
they
met
a
short
time
later
nagel
dropped
his
burden
in
the
ash
and
squirmed
to
straighten
his
body
he
looked
curiously
at
the
figure
in
the
stretcher
then
at
crag
does
make
much
sense
to
me
he
said
critically
where
are
we
going
to
get
the
oxygen
to
keep
this
bird
alive
that
my
worry
crag
snapped
shortly
seems
to
me
it
mine
nagel
pointed
out
i
the
oxygen
man
crag
probed
the
voice
for
defiance
there
was
none
nagel
was
merely
stating
a
fact
an
honest
worry
his
temper
was
subsiding
when
larkwell
spoke
he
right
this
bird
a
parasite
we
ought
to
heave
him
in
the
rill
hell
we
got
worries
enough
without
knock
it
off
crag
snarled
harshly
there
was
a
short
silence
during
which
the
others
looked
defiantly
at
him
stop
the
bickering
and
let
get
going
crag
ordered
he
felt
on
the
verge
of
an
explosion
wanted
to
lash
out
take
it
easy
he
told
himself
with
fresh
oxygen
and
three
men
the
remainder
of
the
trip
was
easier
prochaska
was
waiting
for
them
he
helped
haul
the
bandit
crewman
to
the
safety
of
the
space
cabin
when
it
was
pressurized
they
removed
their
suits
and
crag
began
to
strip
the
heavy
space
garments
from
the
injured
man
body
he
finished
and
stepped
back
letting
him
lie
on
the
deck
they
stood
in
a
tight
silently
studying
the
inert
figure
it
was
that
of
an
extremely
short
man
about
five
feet
crag
judged
and
thin
a
thinness
without
emaciation
his
face
was
pale
haggard
and
like
the
aztec
crewmen
covered
with
stubbly
beard
he
appeared
in
his
late
thirties
or
early
forties
but
crag
surmised
he
was
much
younger
his
chest
rose
and
fell
irregularly
and
his
breathing
was
harsh
crag
knelt
and
checked
his
pulse
it
was
shallow
fast
i
do
know
he
got
to
his
feet
he
may
have
internal
injuries
or
just
a
bad
concussion
to
hell
with
him
spat
larkwell
prochaska
said
he
either
live
or
die
in
either
case
there
not
much
we
can
do
about
it
his
voice
was
callous
just
crag
nodded
agreement
the
chief
turned
his
back
crag
was
brooding
over
the
possible
complications
of
having
an
enemy
in
their
midst
when
his
nostrils
caught
a
familiar
whiff
he
turned
startled
the
chief
was
holding
a
pot
of
coffee
i
did
smuggle
one
small
helping
he
confessed
crag
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
pot
i
should
cite
you
for
a
however
he
reached
for
the
cup
the
chief
was
extending
they
drank
the
coffee
slowly
savoring
each
drop
while
larkwell
outlined
their
next
step
it
was
one
crag
had
been
worrying
about
as
you
know
the
plans
call
for
living
in
the
aztec
until
we
can
get
a
sheltered
airlock
into
operation
larkwell
explained
to
do
that
we
got
ta
lower
this
baby
to
the
horizontal
so
i
can
loosen
the
afterburner
section
and
clear
out
the
gunk
then
we
can
get
the
prime
airlock
installed
and
working
that
should
give
us
ample
quarters
until
we
can
build
the
permanent
lock
maybe
in
that
rill
we
passed
we
got
to
rush
that
nagel
cut
in
right
now
we
lose
total
cabin
pressure
every
time
we
stir
out
of
this
trap
we
ca
keep
it
up
for
long
crag
nodded
nagel
was
right
the
airlock
had
to
be
the
first
order
of
business
the
plans
called
for
just
such
a
move
and
accordingly
the
rocket
had
been
designed
with
such
a
conversion
in
mind
only
it
had
been
planned
as
a
stopgap
one
to
be
used
only
until
a
airlock
could
be
constructed
now
that
drone
able
had
been
lost
golly
what
we
do
with
all
the
room
prochaska
broke
in
humorously
he
flicked
his
eyes
around
the
cabin
just
imagine
we
be
able
to
sleep
stretched
out
instead
of
doubled
up
in
a
bucket
seat
larkwell
took
up
the
conversation
and
they
listened
while
he
outlined
the
procedure
it
was
his
show
and
they
gave
him
full
stage
he
suggested
they
might
be
able
to
use
one
of
aztec
now
useless
servo
motors
in
the
task
when
he
finished
crag
glanced
down
at
the
bandit
crewman
pale
blue
eyes
stared
back
at
him
calm
yet
tinged
with
mockery
they
exchanged
a
long
look
feel
better
crag
finally
asked
wondering
if
by
any
chance
he
spoke
english
yes
thank
you
the
voice
held
the
barest
suggestion
of
an
accent
we
brought
you
to
our
ship
crag
stopped
wondering
how
to
proceed
after
all
the
man
was
an
enemy
a
dangerous
one
at
that
so
i
see
the
voice
was
laconic
why
we
human
snapped
crag
brutally
the
pale
blue
eyes
regarded
him
intently
i
adam
crag
commander
he
added
the
bandit
crewman
tried
to
push
himself
up
on
his
elbow
his
face
blanched
and
he
fell
back
i
seem
to
be
a
trifle
weak
he
apologized
he
looked
at
the
circle
of
faces
before
his
eyes
settled
back
on
crag
my
name
is
richter
otto
richter
prochaska
said
that
a
german
name
i
am
german
on
an
iron
curtain
rocket
nagel
asked
sarcastically
richter
gave
the
oxygen
man
a
long
cool
look
that
seems
to
be
the
case
he
said
finally
the
group
fell
silent
it
was
crag
move
he
hesitated
when
he
spoke
his
tone
was
decisive
we
stuck
with
you
for
the
time
being
you
may
regard
yourself
as
confined
you
will
not
be
allowed
any
freedom
until
we
decide
what
to
do
with
you
i
understand
as
soon
as
we
modify
the
valves
on
your
suit
to
fit
our
cylinders
going
to
move
you
outside
he
instructed
nagel
to
get
busy
on
the
valves
then
turned
to
larkwell
let
get
along
with
lowering
this
baby
chapter
gordon
nagel
the
professor
turned
the
name
over
in
his
mind
yes
i
believe
i
recall
him
let
see
that
would
have
been
about
he
paused
looking
thoughtfully
into
space
the
agent
said
graduated
in
one
of
your
honor
students
ah
yes
how
could
i
have
forgotten
the
professor
folded
his
hands
across
his
plump
stomach
and
settled
back
in
his
chair
i
seem
to
recall
him
as
sort
of
an
intense
nervous
type
he
said
at
last
sort
of
withdrawn
but
as
you
mentioned
quite
brilliant
now
that
i
think
of
it
he
abruptly
stopped
speaking
and
looked
at
the
agent
with
a
startled
face
you
mean
the
man
in
the
moon
he
blurted
yes
that
the
one
ah
no
wonder
the
name
sounded
so
familiar
but
of
course
we
have
so
many
famous
alumni
ruthill
university
prides
itself
of
course
the
agent
cut
in
the
professor
gave
him
a
hurt
look
before
he
began
talking
again
he
rambled
at
length
every
word
he
uttered
was
taped
on
the
agent
pocket
recorder
gordon
nagel
the
young
man
on
the
moon
flight
why
certainly
i
recall
young
nagel
the
high
school
principal
said
a
fine
student
one
of
the
best
he
looked
archly
at
the
agent
down
a
long
thin
nose
braxton
high
school
is
extremely
proud
of
gordon
nagel
extremely
proud
if
i
say
so
myself
he
has
set
a
mark
for
other
young
men
to
strive
for
of
course
the
agent
agreed
this
is
a
case
which
well
vindicates
the
stress
we
put
on
the
physical
and
life
sciences
the
principal
continued
it
is
the
objective
of
braxton
high
school
to
give
every
qualified
student
the
groundwork
he
needs
for
later
academic
success
that
is
students
with
sufficiently
high
he
added
certainly
but
about
gordon
nagel
yes
of
course
the
principal
began
to
speak
again
the
agent
relaxed
listening
he
did
give
a
damn
about
the
moon
but
he
was
extremely
interested
in
the
thirty
some
years
of
nagel
life
preceding
that
trip
very
much
so
he
left
the
school
thinking
that
nagel
owed
quite
a
lot
to
braxton
high
at
least
the
principal
had
inferred
as
much
yes
i
did
go
with
gordon
for
a
while
leroy
farwell
said
but
of
course
it
was
never
serious
just
an
occasional
school
dance
or
something
he
might
be
famous
but
well
frankly
he
was
my
type
he
was
an
awful
drip
her
eyes
brushed
the
agent
face
meaningfully
i
like
live
if
you
know
what
i
mean
certainly
farwell
the
agent
said
gravely
but
about
nagel
there
were
many
people
representing
three
decades
of
contact
with
gordon
nagel
some
of
them
recalled
him
only
fleetingly
others
rambled
at
length
odd
little
entries
came
to
life
to
fit
into
the
dossier
photographs
and
records
were
exhumed
gordon
nagel
gordon
nagel
the
file
on
gordon
nagel
grew
colonel
michael
gotch
did
like
the
idea
of
an
addition
to
the
aztec
crew
did
like
it
at
all
he
informed
crag
that
the
rescue
had
been
entirely
unnecessary
unrealistic
was
the
word
he
had
used
he
was
extremely
interested
in
the
fact
that
bandit
housed
an
arsenal
he
suggested
in
view
of
drone
able
loss
they
should
overlook
bandit
supplies
especially
as
you
have
another
mouth
to
feed
he
said
blandly
crag
agreed
he
did
say
so
but
he
had
already
planned
just
such
a
move
the
colonel
immediately
launched
into
a
barrage
of
questions
concerning
the
crashed
rocket
he
seemed
grieved
when
crag
supply
answers
down
to
the
last
detail
look
crag
finally
exploded
give
us
time
time
we
just
got
here
remember
yes
yes
i
know
but
the
information
is
vital
gotch
said
firmly
i
would
appreciate
it
if
you
would
try
crag
cursed
and
snapped
the
communicator
off
what
wrong
the
bird
colonel
heckling
you
hounding
is
the
word
crag
corrected
he
fixed
the
chief
with
a
baleful
eye
and
uttered
an
epithet
with
regard
to
the
ancestry
prochaska
chuckled
larkwell
quickly
demonstrated
that
he
knew
the
aztec
inside
and
out
far
better
than
did
any
of
the
others
aside
from
several
large
cables
supplied
expressly
for
the
purpose
of
lowering
the
rocket
he
obtained
the
rest
of
the
equipment
needed
from
the
ship
under
his
direction
two
winches
were
set
up
about
thirty
yards
from
the
ship
and
a
cable
run
to
each
to
form
a
a
second
line
ran
from
each
winch
to
a
nearby
shallow
gully
heavy
weights
now
useless
parts
of
the
ship
engines
were
fastened
to
these
and
buried
the
lines
were
intended
to
anchor
the
winches
during
the
critical
period
of
lowering
the
rocket
finally
larkwell
ran
a
guide
line
from
the
aztec
nose
to
a
third
winch
this
one
was
powered
by
an
electric
motor
which
was
powered
by
the
ship
batteries
while
larkwell
and
nagel
prepared
to
lower
the
rocket
crag
smoothed
off
an
area
of
the
plain
surface
and
marked
off
a
square
he
finished
and
looked
at
his
handiwork
with
satisfaction
richter
eyes
were
filled
with
interest
using
it
to
chart
the
frequency
of
meteorite
falls
crag
explained
we
like
to
get
an
idea
of
the
hazard
plenty
richter
said
succinctly
he
started
to
add
more
and
stopped
crag
felt
the
urge
to
pump
him
but
refrained
the
least
he
became
involved
the
better
he
thought
it
did
escape
him
that
the
german
seemed
to
have
recovered
to
a
remarkable
extent
well
that
was
something
else
to
remember
richter
injured
was
one
thing
but
richter
recovered
he
snapped
the
thought
off
and
turned
toward
the
base
of
the
rocket
indicating
that
the
german
should
follow
larkwell
was
testing
the
winches
and
checking
the
cables
when
they
arrived
about
ready
he
told
crag
then
let
her
go
the
construction
boss
nodded
and
barked
a
command
to
prochaska
and
nagel
who
were
manning
the
restraining
winches
when
they
acknowledged
they
were
ready
he
strode
to
the
power
winch
okay
his
voice
was
a
terse
crack
in
the
interphones
the
aztec
shuddered
on
its
base
teetering
then
its
nose
began
to
cant
downward
it
moved
slowly
in
an
arc
across
the
sky
take
up
larkwell
barked
into
the
mike
the
guide
lines
tautened
okay
this
time
prochaska
and
nagel
fed
line
through
the
winches
more
slowly
the
nose
of
the
rocket
had
passed
through
sixty
degrees
of
arc
when
its
tail
began
to
inch
backward
biting
into
the
plain
hold
up
larkwell
circled
the
rocket
and
approached
the
tailfins
from
one
side
he
looked
up
at
the
body
of
the
ship
then
back
at
the
base
satisfied
it
would
hold
he
ordered
the
winches
started
the
nose
moved
slowly
toward
the
ground
swaying
slightly
from
side
to
side
in
another
moment
it
lay
on
its
belly
on
the
plain
now
the
real
work
begins
larkwell
told
crag
we
got
ta
clean
everything
out
of
that
stovepipe
and
get
the
airlock
rigged
his
voice
was
complaining
but
his
face
indicated
the
importance
he
attached
to
the
job
how
long
do
you
figure
it
take
larkwell
rubbed
his
faceplate
thoughtfully
about
two
days
with
some
catnaps
and
some
help
good
crag
looked
thoughtfully
at
richter
any
reason
you
help
he
asked
sharply
none
at
all
richter
answered
solemnly
while
larkwell
and
nagel
labored
in
the
tail
section
crag
and
prochaska
rearranged
the
space
cabin
the
chemical
commode
was
placed
in
one
corner
and
a
nylon
curtain
rigged
around
it
their
one
concession
to
civilization
crag
was
conscious
of
richter
eyes
following
them
weighing
analyzing
speculating
he
caught
himself
swiveling
around
at
odd
times
to
check
on
him
but
richter
seemed
unconcerned
electric
power
from
the
batteries
was
limited
for
the
most
part
they
would
be
living
on
space
rations
food
concentrates
supplemented
with
vitamin
pills
and
a
square
of
chocolate
daily
per
man
later
when
the
airlock
was
installed
in
the
area
now
occupied
by
the
afterburners
and
machinery
they
would
be
able
to
appreciably
extend
their
living
quarters
until
then
crag
thought
wryly
they
would
live
like
sardines
with
an
enemy
in
their
midst
an
enemy
and
a
saboteur
he
mentally
corrected
aside
from
that
there
was
the
constant
danger
from
meteorite
falls
he
shook
his
head
despairingly
life
on
the
moon
all
it
could
be
not
by
a
damn
sight
nagel
was
becoming
perturbed
over
their
oxygen
consumption
he
had
set
up
the
small
tanks
containing
algae
in
a
nutrient
solution
tending
them
like
a
mother
hen
in
time
if
the
cultivation
were
successful
the
small
algae
farm
would
convert
the
carbon
dioxide
from
their
respiration
into
oxygen
at
the
present
time
the
carbon
dioxide
was
being
absorbed
by
chemical
means
as
things
stood
it
was
necessary
for
the
entire
crew
to
don
spacesuits
every
time
one
of
them
left
the
cabin
each
time
the
cabin
air
was
lost
in
the
vacuum
of
the
moon
crag
pointed
out
there
was
no
alternative
until
the
airlock
was
completed
a
fact
which
did
keep
nagel
from
complaining
otto
richter
recovered
fast
before
another
day
had
passed
the
aztec
continued
to
operate
by
earth
clock
he
seemed
to
have
completely
recovered
it
was
evident
that
concussion
and
shock
had
been
the
extent
of
his
injuries
crag
did
know
whether
to
be
sorry
or
glad
he
did
in
fact
know
what
to
do
with
the
man
he
gave
firm
orders
that
richter
was
never
to
be
left
alone
not
for
a
moment
he
told
him
you
will
not
be
allowed
in
the
area
of
any
of
the
electronic
equipment
first
time
you
do
he
looked
meaningfully
at
him
i
understand
the
german
said
thereafter
except
for
occasional
trips
to
the
commode
or
to
help
with
work
he
kept
to
the
corner
of
the
space
cabin
allotted
him
larkwell
came
up
for
the
evening
meal
wearing
a
grim
look
he
extended
his
hand
toward
crag
holding
a
jagged
chunk
of
rock
nearly
the
size
of
a
baseball
crag
took
the
hunk
and
hefted
it
thoughtfully
meteorite
the
others
clustered
around
yeah
i
saw
a
hole
in
that
cleared
off
section
and
reached
down
there
she
was
big
as
life
if
that
had
hit
this
pipe
we
be
dead
ducks
prochaska
observed
but
it
did
hit
crag
corrected
trying
to
allay
any
gathering
nervousness
it
just
means
that
we
going
to
have
to
get
going
on
the
rill
airlock
as
soon
as
possible
how
will
loss
of
able
affect
that
nagel
asked
curiously
only
in
the
matter
of
size
crag
explained
the
possible
loss
of
a
drone
was
taken
into
account
the
plastiblocks
are
constructed
to
make
any
size
shelter
possible
we
start
immediately
when
baker
lands
he
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
men
let
not
borrow
any
trouble
yeah
there
plenty
without
borrowing
any
more
prochaska
agreed
he
smiled
cheerfully
i
vote
we
all
stop
worrying
and
eat
another
complication
arose
drone
baker
would
be
in
orbit
the
following
morning
prochaska
had
to
be
prepared
to
bring
it
down
he
was
busy
moving
his
equipment
into
one
compact
corner
opposite
the
commode
he
rigged
a
curtain
around
it
partly
for
privacy
but
mainly
to
mark
off
a
definite
area
prohibited
to
richter
the
communicator
was
becoming
another
problem
that
harried
crag
a
government
geologist
wanted
a
complete
description
of
arzachel
rock
structure
a
space
medicine
doctor
had
a
lot
of
questions
about
the
working
of
the
dioxide
exchange
system
someone
else
crag
was
never
quite
sure
who
wanted
an
exact
description
of
how
the
aztec
had
handled
during
letdown
in
the
end
he
got
on
the
communicator
and
curtly
asked
for
gotch
keep
these
people
off
our
backs
until
we
land
drone
baker
he
told
him
it
not
headquarters
for
some
damned
quiz
program
you
big
news
gotch
placated
what
you
tell
us
will
help
with
future
rockets
like
a
mineral
description
of
the
terrain
even
that
but
cheer
up
commander
the
worst
is
yet
to
come
he
broke
off
before
crag
could
snap
a
reply
prochaska
grinned
at
his
discomfiture
that
what
comes
of
being
famous
he
said
we
wheels
a
wheel
on
the
moon
crag
looked
questioningly
at
him
is
that
good
damned
if
i
know
i
have
been
here
long
enough
crag
was
surprised
to
see
how
rapidly
work
in
the
tail
section
was
progressing
larkwell
had
loosened
the
giant
engines
and
fuel
tanks
and
pulled
them
from
the
ship
with
power
from
one
of
the
rocket
servo
motors
they
lay
on
the
dusty
floor
of
the
plain
incongruous
in
their
new
setting
he
thought
it
a
harbinger
of
things
to
come
a
rocket
garage
on
the
floor
of
barren
arzachel
four
men
attempting
to
build
an
empire
from
the
hull
of
a
space
ship
in
time
it
would
be
replaced
by
an
airlock
in
a
rill
a
military
base
a
domed
city
pickering
field
would
become
a
transportation
center
perhaps
the
hub
of
the
solar
system
transportation
empire
first
single
freighters
then
ore
trains
would
travel
the
highways
of
space
between
earth
mother
and
her
long
separated
child
he
sighed
the
ore
trains
were
a
long
way
in
the
future
larkwell
crawled
out
from
the
cavern
he
had
hollowed
in
the
hull
and
stretched
time
for
chow
he
grunted
his
voice
over
the
interphones
sounded
tired
nagel
followed
him
looking
morose
he
did
acknowledge
crag
presence
at
evening
by
earth
clock
they
ate
their
scant
fare
they
were
unusually
silent
the
chief
seemed
weary
from
his
long
vigil
on
the
scope
larkwell
face
was
sweaty
smudged
with
grease
he
ate
quickly
with
the
air
of
a
man
preoccupied
with
weighty
problems
nagel
was
clearly
bushed
larkwell
fast
pace
had
been
too
much
for
him
he
wore
a
cross
irritable
expression
and
avoided
all
conversation
richter
sat
alone
seemingly
unconcerned
that
he
was
a
virtual
prisoner
confined
to
one
small
corner
of
the
cabin
barely
large
enough
to
provide
sleeping
space
crag
had
no
feelings
where
he
was
concerned
neither
resentment
nor
sympathy
the
german
was
just
a
happenstance
a
castaway
in
the
war
for
arzachel
or
more
probable
he
thought
the
war
for
the
moon
after
chow
the
men
took
turns
shaving
with
the
single
razor
it
had
been
supplied
only
because
of
the
need
to
keep
the
oxygen
ports
in
the
helmets
free
and
to
keep
the
lip
mikes
clear
pure
luxury
prochaska
said
when
his
turn
came
nothing
too
good
for
the
spaceman
amen
crag
agreed
i
hope
the
next
crew
is
going
to
get
a
bar
of
soap
for
their
sake
i
hope
they
pick
something
better
than
this
crummy
planet
larkwell
grunted
drone
baker
had
entered
the
moon
gravisphere
at
the
precise
time
spelled
out
by
the
earth
computers
its
speed
had
dropped
to
a
mere
two
hundred
miles
per
hour
it
began
to
accelerate
pulled
by
the
moon
moving
in
a
vast
trajectory
calculated
to
put
it
into
a
closing
orbit
around
the
barren
satellite
prochaska
picked
it
up
and
followed
it
on
the
scope
telemeter
control
from
alpine
fired
the
first
braking
rockets
the
blast
countered
the
moon
pull
drone
baker
was
still
a
speck
on
the
scope
a
solitary
traveler
rushing
toward
them
through
the
void
seems
incredible
it
took
us
that
long
crag
mused
studying
the
instrument
panel
he
reached
over
and
activated
the
analog
back
on
earth
saucers
with
faces
lifted
to
the
skies
were
tracking
the
flight
their
information
was
channeled
into
computer
batteries
integrated
analyzed
and
sent
back
into
space
the
wave
train
ended
in
a
gridded
scope
the
analog
crag
was
viewing
seemed
a
damned
lot
shorter
when
we
were
up
there
he
speculated
aloud
that
one
experience
that
really
telescopes
time
the
chief
agreed
i
hate
to
have
to
sweat
it
out
again
when
do
we
take
over
prochaska
glanced
at
the
master
chrono
not
till
give
or
take
a
few
minutes
it
depends
on
the
final
computations
from
alpine
better
catch
some
sleep
crag
suggested
it
going
to
be
touchy
once
we
get
hold
of
it
we
be
damn
lucky
if
we
get
it
down
in
arzachel
we
better
crag
grinned
muff
this
and
we
might
as
well
take
out
lunar
citizenship
no
thanks
not
interested
what
the
matter
max
no
pioneer
spirit
go
to
hell
prochaska
answered
amiably
now
prochaska
that
no
way
to
speak
to
your
commanding
officer
crag
reproved
with
mock
severity
okay
go
to
hell
sir
he
joked
richter
was
a
problem
someone
had
to
be
awake
at
all
times
crag
decided
to
break
the
crew
into
watches
and
laid
out
a
tentative
schedule
he
would
take
the
first
watch
larkwell
would
relieve
him
at
midnight
and
nagel
would
take
over
at
that
way
prochaska
would
get
a
full
night
sleep
he
would
need
steady
nerves
come
morning
he
outlined
the
schedule
to
the
crew
neither
larkwell
nor
nagel
appeared
enthusiastic
over
the
prospect
of
initiating
a
watch
regime
but
neither
protested
openly
when
the
others
were
asleep
crag
cut
off
the
light
to
preserve
battery
power
he
studied
the
lunar
landscape
out
the
port
thinking
it
must
be
the
bleakest
spot
in
the
universe
he
twisted
his
head
and
looked
starward
the
sky
was
a
grab
bag
of
suns
off
to
one
side
giant
orion
looked
across
the
gulf
of
space
at
taurus
and
the
pleiades
the
seven
daughters
of
atlas
chapter
commander
crag
came
to
with
a
start
prochaska
was
leaning
over
him
urgency
was
written
across
his
face
come
quick
the
chief
stepped
back
and
motioned
with
his
head
toward
the
instrument
corner
crag
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
sense
of
alarm
richter
and
larkwell
were
still
asleep
he
glanced
at
the
master
chrono
and
followed
him
into
the
electronics
corner
nagel
was
standing
by
the
scope
a
frightened
look
on
his
face
what
up
nagel
woke
me
at
six
i
came
in
to
get
ready
for
drone
baker
get
to
the
point
crag
snapped
irritably
sabotage
he
indicated
under
the
panel
all
the
wiring
under
the
main
console
been
slashed
crag
felt
a
sense
of
dread
how
long
will
it
take
to
make
repairs
i
do
know
do
know
the
full
extent
of
the
damage
find
out
crag
barked
how
about
the
communicator
have
tried
it
prochaska
admitted
i
woke
you
up
as
soon
as
i
found
what
had
happened
he
reached
over
and
turned
a
knob
after
a
few
seconds
a
hum
came
from
the
console
works
he
said
see
how
quickly
you
can
make
repairs
crag
ordered
we
got
to
hook
onto
the
drone
pretty
quick
he
swung
impatiently
toward
nagel
was
anyone
up
during
your
watch
did
anyone
go
to
the
commode
nagel
said
defensively
no
and
i
was
awake
all
the
time
too
defensive
crag
thought
but
no
one
had
stirred
during
his
watch
therefore
the
sabotage
had
occurred
between
midnight
and
the
time
nagel
wakened
prochaska
but
wait
prochaska
could
have
done
the
sabotage
in
the
few
moments
he
was
at
the
console
after
nagel
woke
him
it
would
have
taken
just
one
quick
slash
the
work
of
seconds
that
left
him
in
the
same
spot
he
been
in
with
regard
to
the
time
bomb
he
grated
harshly
at
nagel
wake
larkwell
and
get
on
with
the
airlock
and
do
chatter
about
what
happened
he
added
i
wo
nagel
promised
nervously
he
retreated
as
if
glad
to
be
rid
of
crag
scrutiny
a
lousy
mess
prochaska
grunted
crag
did
answer
if
we
do
solve
this
we
going
to
wind
up
dead
he
pursued
crag
turned
and
faced
him
it
could
be
anybody
you
me
yeah
i
know
the
chief
face
got
a
hard
tight
look
only
it
is
it
is
me
i
do
know
that
crag
countered
prochaska
said
bitterly
you
better
find
out
i
will
crag
said
shortly
he
got
on
the
communicator
it
took
several
minutes
to
raise
alpine
he
was
surprised
when
gotch
answered
and
briefly
related
what
had
happened
is
there
any
possibility
of
telemetering
her
all
the
way
in
he
knew
there
was
but
he
asked
anyway
impossible
okay
well
try
and
make
it
from
here
the
colonel
added
a
few
comments
they
were
colorful
but
definitely
not
complimentary
he
got
the
distinct
impression
the
colonel
was
pleased
with
events
on
the
moon
when
his
cold
voice
faded
from
the
communicator
crag
tried
the
analog
the
grid
scope
came
to
life
but
it
was
blank
of
course
he
thought
drone
baker
was
cut
off
from
earth
by
the
body
of
the
moon
it
could
not
be
simulated
on
the
analog
until
it
came
from
behind
the
blind
side
where
the
earth
saucers
could
track
its
flight
morning
larkwell
said
sticking
his
head
around
the
curtain
how
about
climbing
into
your
suits
so
we
can
get
out
of
this
can
crag
studied
his
face
it
seemed
void
of
any
guile
nagel
stood
nervously
behind
him
okay
crag
said
shortly
he
hated
to
have
prochaska
lose
the
precious
moments
they
hurriedly
donned
their
suits
and
nagel
decompressed
the
cabin
larkwell
opened
the
hatch
and
they
left
crag
closed
it
after
them
and
released
fresh
oxygen
into
the
cabin
richter
took
off
his
suit
and
returned
to
his
corner
his
eyes
were
bright
with
interest
he
knows
crag
thought
at
the
communicator
came
to
life
a
voice
at
the
other
end
gave
drone
baker
position
and
velocity
as
if
nothing
had
happened
the
drone
on
the
far
side
of
the
moon
was
decelerating
dropping
as
servo
mechanisms
operating
on
timers
activated
its
blasters
it
was
guided
solely
by
the
radio
controlled
servos
following
a
flight
path
previously
determined
by
banks
of
computers
everything
was
in
order
except
for
the
snafu
in
arzachel
crag
thought
bitterly
prochaska
worked
silently
swiftly
crag
watched
with
a
helpless
feeling
there
was
room
for
both
of
them
to
work
at
one
time
the
chief
head
and
arms
literally
filled
the
opening
of
the
sabotaged
console
once
he
snapped
for
more
light
and
crag
beamed
a
torch
over
his
shoulder
fretting
from
the
inaction
sounds
came
through
the
rear
bulkhead
where
larkwell
and
nagel
were
working
in
the
tail
section
strange
crag
thought
to
all
appearances
each
crew
member
was
a
dedicated
man
but
one
was
a
traitor
which
one
that
what
he
had
to
find
out
richter
would
have
been
the
logical
suspect
were
it
not
for
the
episode
of
the
time
bomb
no
it
had
been
the
german
it
was
either
the
competent
prochaska
the
sullen
nagel
or
the
somehow
cheerful
but
inscrutable
larkwell
but
there
should
be
a
clue
if
only
he
knew
what
to
look
for
well
he
find
it
when
he
did
he
clenched
his
fists
savagely
at
alpine
simulated
the
drone
on
the
analog
fifteen
minutes
later
prochaska
pulled
his
head
from
the
console
and
asked
crag
to
try
the
scope
it
worked
now
if
i
can
get
those
damn
wires
that
control
the
steering
and
braking
rockets
he
dived
back
into
the
console
crag
looked
at
the
chrono
then
swung
his
eyes
to
the
instruments
drone
baker
was
coming
in
fast
the
minutes
ticked
off
the
communicator
came
to
life
with
more
data
baker
was
approaching
ptolemaeus
on
its
final
leg
the
voice
cut
off
and
gotch
came
on
we
ready
to
transfer
control
prochaska
shook
his
head
negatively
without
looking
up
what
the
maximum
deadline
crag
asked
exactly
three
minutes
ten
seconds
gotch
rasped
prochaska
moved
his
head
to
indicate
maybe
the
communicator
was
silent
crag
watched
the
master
chrono
at
prochaska
was
still
buried
in
the
panel
crag
dismay
grew
dismay
and
a
sense
of
guilt
over
the
sabotage
gotch
had
warned
him
against
the
possibility
innumerable
times
now
it
had
happened
the
loss
of
drone
able
had
been
a
bad
blow
the
loss
of
baker
could
be
fatal
not
only
to
the
success
of
their
mission
but
to
their
survival
survival
meant
an
airlock
and
the
ability
to
live
on
their
scant
supplies
until
arzachel
was
equipped
to
handle
incoming
rockets
on
a
basis
well
one
thing
at
a
time
he
thought
he
suppressed
the
worry
nagging
at
his
mind
just
now
it
was
drone
turn
at
bat
at
prochaska
sprang
to
his
feet
and
nodded
crag
barked
an
okay
into
the
communicator
while
the
chief
got
his
bearings
on
the
instruments
crag
hoped
the
lost
minute
would
be
fatal
by
prochaska
had
the
drone
under
control
it
was
feet
over
alphons
traveling
at
slightly
better
than
a
thousand
miles
per
hour
he
hit
the
braking
rockets
hard
we
not
going
to
make
it
he
gritted
he
squinted
his
eyes
his
face
was
set
grim
hold
it
with
full
braking
power
not
sufficient
fuel
allowance
then
crash
it
as
close
as
possible
prochaska
nodded
and
moved
a
control
full
over
the
drone
braking
rockets
were
blasting
continuously
crag
studied
the
instruments
it
was
going
to
be
close
by
the
instrument
data
they
could
make
it
drone
baker
seemed
doomed
it
was
too
high
moving
too
fast
despite
the
lavish
waste
of
braking
power
his
hand
clenched
the
back
of
prochaska
seat
he
could
tear
his
eyes
from
the
scope
baker
thundered
down
suddenly
the
drone
was
on
them
it
cleared
the
north
rim
of
arzachel
at
feet
too
high
crag
the
difference
lay
in
the
lost
minute
prochaska
pushed
and
held
the
controls
crag
pictured
the
rocket
bucking
vibrating
torn
by
the
conflict
of
energies
within
its
fragile
body
prochaska
fingered
the
steering
rockets
and
pushed
the
drone
nose
upward
crag
saw
it
through
the
port
it
rushed
through
space
in
a
skidding
fashion
before
it
began
to
move
upward
from
the
face
of
the
moon
prochaska
hit
the
braking
jets
with
full
power
crag
craned
his
head
to
follow
its
flight
out
of
one
corner
of
his
eye
he
saw
nagel
and
larkwell
on
the
plain
their
helmeted
heads
turned
skyward
he
scrunched
his
face
hard
against
the
port
and
caught
the
drone
at
the
top
of
its
climb
it
was
a
slender
needle
with
light
glinting
on
its
tail
the
sword
of
damocles
hanging
above
their
heads
it
hung
suspended
in
space
then
began
backing
down
dropping
stern
first
with
flame
and
white
vapor
pouring
from
its
tail
jets
it
came
fast
occasional
spurts
from
radial
jets
around
its
nose
kept
its
body
perpendicular
to
the
plain
vapor
from
the
trail
fluffed
out
hiding
the
body
of
the
rocket
the
flame
licked
out
while
the
rocket
was
still
over
a
hundred
feet
in
the
air
prochaska
cursed
softly
the
rocket
seemed
riveted
to
the
black
sky
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
before
it
began
to
fall
faster
faster
it
smashed
into
the
lunar
surface
lost
from
sight
exit
baker
prochaska
said
woodenly
quietly
crag
got
on
the
communicator
and
reported
to
gotch
there
was
a
brief
silence
when
he
had
finished
finally
gotch
said
drone
charlie
will
be
launched
on
schedule
have
to
reassess
our
logistics
though
maybe
we
better
knock
off
the
idea
of
the
idea
and
shoot
along
extra
oxygen
and
supplies
instead
how
does
the
meteorite
problem
look
lousy
said
crag
irritably
we
had
a
scary
near
miss
i
bet
on
being
able
to
survive
too
long
in
the
open
again
there
was
a
silence
you
have
to
gotch
said
slowly
unless
you
can
salvage
cargo
we
check
that
you
might
investigate
the
possibility
of
covering
the
aztec
with
ash
sure
sure
crag
broke
in
good
idea
i
have
the
boys
break
out
the
road
grader
immediately
do
be
facetious
gotch
reprimanded
we
have
a
problem
to
work
out
you
telling
me
in
the
meantime
try
and
clean
up
that
other
situation
by
other
situation
crag
knew
he
was
referring
to
the
sabotage
sure
be
an
engineer
intelligence
agent
spaceman
and
superman
all
rolled
into
one
he
wrinkled
his
face
bitterly
still
he
had
to
admire
the
colonel
tenacity
he
was
a
man
determined
to
conquer
the
moon
will
do
crag
said
finally
in
the
meantime
we
look
baker
over
there
might
be
some
salvage
do
that
the
colonel
said
crisply
he
cut
off
chapter
max
prochaska
was
a
real
boy
arthur
bingham
said
firmly
friendly
with
everyone
in
town
of
course
vista
was
just
a
small
place
then
she
added
reminiscently
not
like
now
especially
since
the
helicopter
factory
moved
in
i
do
declare
a
soul
recognize
the
place
any
longer
with
all
the
housing
tracts
and
the
new
supermarket
certainly
the
agent
interjected
but
about
max
prochaska
yes
of
course
bingham
bit
her
lip
reflectively
my
husband
always
said
max
would
go
places
i
wish
he
could
have
lived
to
see
it
for
just
a
moment
her
eyes
brimmed
wetly
then
she
blew
her
nose
wiping
them
in
the
process
the
agent
waited
until
she
had
composed
herself
little
max
i
always
think
of
him
as
little
max
she
explained
was
smart
and
pleasant
real
well
liked
at
school
and
he
attended
church
she
stressed
the
word
always
just
think
now
they
say
he
on
the
moon
her
eyes
fixed
the
agent
with
interest
you
think
he
get
dizzy
the
agent
almost
enjoyed
tracing
max
prochaska
history
it
was
a
neat
job
one
that
moved
through
a
regular
sequence
teacher
minister
family
doctor
druggist
scoutmaster
athletic
director
all
the
ties
a
boy
makes
and
retains
everything
was
compact
records
deeds
acquaintances
all
in
one
handy
package
the
memory
of
a
man
who
grew
up
in
a
small
town
persisted
borne
in
the
minds
of
people
whose
worlds
were
small
the
vista
paper
had
obligingly
carried
prochaska
biography
right
on
the
front
page
under
the
headline
vistan
lands
on
moon
the
leading
local
drugstore
was
featuring
a
prochaska
sundae
and
the
mayor
of
the
town
had
proclaimed
max
prochaska
week
clearly
vista
was
proud
of
its
native
son
but
not
nearly
as
proud
as
the
elderly
couple
who
still
tended
a
chicken
ranch
on
the
outskirts
of
town
max
is
a
good
boy
prochaska
said
simply
her
husband
beamed
agreement
on
the
surface
prochaska
record
seemed
clean
a
good
student
the
usual
array
of
girls
and
nothing
much
in
the
way
of
peccadillos
you
could
hang
a
hat
on
the
agent
last
view
of
the
town
was
a
sign
at
the
city
limits
vista
the
home
of
max
prochaska
drone
baker
looked
a
complete
loss
it
had
smashed
tail
down
onto
the
ash
covered
plain
about
four
miles
to
the
southeast
of
the
aztec
off
the
eastern
lip
of
the
curved
crescent
prochaska
had
dubbed
backbone
ridge
crag
calculated
that
the
positions
of
bandit
the
drone
and
their
own
rocket
roughly
formed
an
equilateral
triangle
on
the
floor
of
the
crater
the
lower
section
of
the
rocket
was
crushed
its
hull
split
lengthwise
crag
and
larkwell
studied
the
scene
from
a
small
knoll
the
drone
lay
in
a
comparatively
level
area
about
thirty
feet
from
the
edge
of
a
deep
fissure
careened
at
a
steep
angle
from
the
vertical
only
its
tail
imbedded
into
the
ground
kept
it
from
toppling
might
as
well
have
a
closer
look
larkwell
said
finally
crag
nodded
and
beckoned
richter
who
was
waiting
at
the
bottom
of
the
knoll
since
the
sabotage
incident
he
had
split
the
crew
into
two
sections
which
varied
according
to
task
richter
was
used
by
either
section
as
needed
it
was
an
arrangement
that
crag
liked
but
he
did
feel
it
wise
or
safe
to
allow
anyone
the
privilege
of
privacy
richter
circled
the
base
of
the
knoll
and
met
them
when
they
reached
the
rocket
larkwell
circled
it
several
times
studying
it
from
all
angles
we
might
come
out
pretty
well
he
said
finally
his
voice
carried
a
dubious
note
he
lifted
his
head
and
contemplated
the
rocket
again
maybe
some
of
the
cargo
rode
through
we
hope
crag
said
i
would
bank
too
much
on
it
think
we
might
get
inside
larkwell
said
decisively
not
this
boy
not
until
we
pull
the
nose
down
this
baby
ready
to
topple
they
were
discussing
their
next
move
when
prochaska
came
in
on
the
interphone
alpine
wants
the
dope
on
baker
damn
alpine
crag
thought
moodily
he
contemplated
the
rocket
tell
it
still
here
all
at
once
he
felt
depressed
strain
he
told
himself
since
his
life
had
been
a
succession
of
climaxes
each
a
little
rougher
than
the
one
preceding
not
that
he
was
alone
in
his
reactions
his
mind
switched
to
nagel
the
oxygen
man
had
become
sullen
irritable
almost
completely
withdrawn
from
the
group
he
was
crag
thought
a
lonely
miserable
man
even
larkwell
was
beginning
to
show
the
affects
of
their
struggle
to
survive
his
normal
easygoing
manner
was
broken
by
periods
of
surliness
only
prochaska
had
managed
to
maintain
his
calm
approach
to
life
but
the
effects
were
telling
physically
his
face
was
a
mask
of
parchment
drawn
tightly
over
bone
accentuating
his
tired
hollow
eyes
but
richter
seemed
to
be
thriving
why
not
he
was
a
doomed
man
given
a
fresh
reprieve
on
life
with
no
responsibilities
to
burden
his
existence
he
was
on
a
gravy
train
for
the
time
being
still
richter
was
in
an
unenviable
spot
nagel
was
openly
hostile
toward
him
his
demeanor
and
looks
were
calculated
to
tell
the
german
he
was
an
undesirable
intruder
larkwell
attitude
was
one
of
avoidance
he
simply
acted
as
if
the
german
were
not
on
the
moon
when
in
the
course
of
work
it
became
necessary
to
give
richter
an
order
he
did
it
with
a
short
surly
bark
prochaska
concealed
whatever
feeling
he
had
toward
the
german
no
he
thought
richter
lot
was
easy
he
tried
to
push
the
mood
aside
it
would
push
he
checked
his
oxygen
and
decided
to
swing
over
to
bandit
before
returning
the
sooner
they
got
started
on
the
salvage
job
the
better
he
communicated
his
plan
to
the
others
larkwell
protested
getting
ready
to
open
this
baby
more
important
we
never
get
started
on
the
airlock
fooling
around
this
god
forsaken
desert
well
get
to
that
too
crag
promised
fighting
to
keep
his
temper
under
control
by
going
from
here
we
save
a
couple
of
miles
over
having
to
make
a
special
trip
suit
yourself
the
construction
boss
said
truculently
crag
nodded
stiffly
and
started
toward
the
enemy
rocket
now
lost
to
view
behind
intervening
rock
formations
by
unspoken
agreement
larkwell
fell
in
at
the
rear
leaving
richter
sandwiched
between
them
the
german
lived
constantly
under
the
scrutiny
of
one
or
another
of
the
crew
crag
intended
to
keep
it
that
way
the
trip
was
more
difficult
than
he
had
anticipated
twice
they
were
forced
to
detour
around
deep
fissures
before
they
had
gone
very
far
crag
radiation
counter
came
to
life
he
made
a
note
of
the
spot
thinking
that
later
they
would
map
the
boundaries
of
the
radioactive
area
once
or
twice
he
checked
his
course
with
prochaska
his
oxygen
meter
told
him
they
would
have
to
hurry
when
they
topped
a
low
knoll
of
glazed
rock
and
came
upon
the
ship
he
stopped
and
turned
watching
richter
if
he
had
expected
any
show
of
emotion
he
was
disappointed
his
face
was
impassive
it
gave
crag
the
feeling
that
he
was
really
seeing
the
rocket
that
he
was
looking
far
beyond
into
nothingness
his
eyes
behind
the
face
plate
were
vacuous
pools
we
did
have
time
to
bury
your
companions
crag
said
he
indicated
the
rocket
with
a
motion
of
his
head
and
his
voice
turned
cruel
they
still
in
there
richter
expression
remained
unchanged
it
does
make
much
difference
here
he
said
finally
he
turned
and
faced
crag
one
thing
you
should
understand
they
he
swept
his
arm
toward
bandit
were
the
military
and
you
richter
said
stiffly
i
am
a
scientist
who
destroyed
our
drone
thinking
it
was
us
they
faced
each
other
across
the
bleak
lunar
desert
the
german
eyes
had
become
blue
fires
azure
coals
leaping
into
flame
it
makes
no
difference
what
you
think
he
said
after
a
moment
my
conscience
is
clear
nuts
larkwell
spat
the
word
with
disgust
richter
shrugged
and
turned
back
toward
the
rocket
crag
looked
at
him
with
varying
emotions
one
thing
was
sure
he
thought
richter
was
a
cool
customer
he
had
seen
new
depths
in
his
blue
eyes
when
they
had
faced
each
other
they
were
hard
eyes
ablaze
with
ice
the
eyes
of
a
fanatic
or
a
saint
he
pushed
the
thought
aside
prochaska
came
in
on
the
phones
to
inquire
about
their
oxygen
crag
checked
chagrined
to
find
that
it
was
too
low
to
spend
more
than
a
few
minutes
at
the
rocket
he
opened
the
arms
locker
thinking
he
would
have
to
get
rid
of
the
weapons
they
could
be
dangerous
in
the
wrong
hands
he
had
been
unable
to
carry
them
back
the
first
trip
then
he
had
regarded
them
as
something
totally
useless
on
the
moon
now
he
was
so
sure
he
hurriedly
studied
the
space
cabin
seeking
the
information
gotch
had
requested
the
floor
and
walls
were
heavily
padded
with
some
foam
material
standard
procedure
to
absorb
vibration
and
attenuate
noise
aside
from
the
controls
there
were
no
projecting
metal
surfaces
or
hard
corners
the
view
ports
were
larger
acceleration
pads
smaller
thicker
all
in
all
the
cabins
of
the
two
rockets
were
quite
similar
he
was
examining
the
contents
of
the
supply
cabinets
when
larkwell
reminded
him
of
their
diminishing
oxygen
supply
they
hurriedly
plundered
bandit
of
six
oxygen
cylinders
and
started
back
across
arzachel
desolate
plain
crag
arbitrarily
broke
the
lunar
day
into
hour
periods
to
correspond
with
earth
time
twelve
hours
were
considered
as
day
the
remaining
time
as
night
he
set
up
regular
communication
periods
in
order
to
schedule
their
activities
under
the
arrangement
alpine
came
in
promptly
at
exactly
a
before
breakfast
by
earth
clock
and
again
following
the
evening
meal
prochaska
monitored
the
channel
during
the
workday
to
cover
possible
urgent
messages
the
schedule
allowed
a
work
period
during
the
day
and
a
work
period
following
the
evening
meal
from
to
the
communication
periods
quickly
deteriorated
into
routine
sessions
a
good
omen
to
crag
but
gotch
kept
his
finger
in
the
pie
crag
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
he
was
available
around
the
clock
consequently
when
the
communicator
came
to
life
midway
through
the
regular
work
period
he
knew
something
was
brewing
something
he
was
going
to
like
so
did
prochaska
his
voice
when
he
called
crag
to
the
communicator
spelled
trouble
crag
used
the
ear
microphones
for
privacy
and
acknowledged
the
call
with
a
distinct
feeling
of
unease
as
he
had
expected
the
caller
was
gotch
drone
charlie
was
launched
at
he
told
crag
we
feed
you
the
data
on
the
regular
channels
there
was
a
brief
silence
this
got
to
make
it
he
added
significantly
crag
said
stonily
we
do
our
best
i
know
you
will
commander
i
have
absolutely
no
fear
on
that
score
how
everything
going
the
twangy
voice
across
the
abyss
of
space
took
on
a
solicitous
tone
that
set
his
nerves
on
edge
wrong
something
bad
he
thought
the
colonel
sounded
like
a
doctor
asking
a
dying
patient
how
he
felt
okay
everything
seems
in
hand
we
got
the
ship
in
good
shape
and
larkwell
thinks
we
might
fare
pretty
well
with
the
drone
it
might
be
in
better
shape
than
we
first
thought
good
good
glad
to
hear
it
we
need
a
silver
lining
once
in
a
while
eh
yeah
but
i
fairly
certain
you
did
call
just
to
cheer
me
up
crag
said
dryly
what
on
your
mind
the
silence
came
again
a
little
longer
this
time
chapter
you
in
trouble
gotch
spoke
like
a
man
carefully
choosing
his
words
intelligence
informs
us
that
another
rocket
been
fired
from
east
of
the
caspian
bunav
got
a
track
on
it
crag
waited
there
are
two
possibilities
gotch
continued
the
first
and
most
logical
assumption
is
that
it
manned
we
surmise
that
from
the
fact
that
their
first
manned
rocket
was
successful
that
is
as
far
as
reaching
the
moon
is
concerned
the
assumption
is
further
borne
out
by
its
trajectory
and
rate
of
acceleration
his
voice
fell
off
and
the
second
possibility
crag
prompted
warhead
gotch
said
succinctly
intelligence
informs
us
that
the
enemy
is
prepared
to
blow
arzachel
off
the
face
of
the
moon
if
they
fail
to
take
it
over
and
they
have
failed
so
far
crag
tossed
the
idea
around
in
his
mind
he
said
fretfully
i
doubt
if
they
could
put
a
warhead
down
on
arzachel
that
takes
some
doing
hell
it
tough
enough
to
monitor
one
in
from
here
let
alone
smack
from
earth
i
think
you
right
but
they
can
try
gotch
voice
became
brisk
here
the
dope
as
we
see
it
we
think
the
rocket
contains
a
landing
party
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
a
moon
base
in
arzachel
naturally
because
that
where
the
lode
is
more
to
the
point
you
expect
an
attack
on
pickering
base
crag
interjected
well
yes
i
think
that
is
a
reasonable
assumption
crag
weighed
the
information
gotch
was
probably
right
a
nuclear
explosion
on
the
moon
would
be
detected
on
earth
that
was
the
dangerous
course
the
shot
that
could
usher
in
world
war
iii
and
perhaps
a
new
cave
era
attack
by
a
landing
party
seemed
more
logical
they
batted
ideas
back
and
forth
the
colonel
suggested
that
just
before
the
landing
phase
of
red
dog
the
code
name
assigned
the
new
rocket
crag
post
armed
guards
at
some
point
covering
the
aztec
might
as
well
get
some
use
out
of
bandit
automatic
weapons
gotch
dryly
concluded
crag
disagreed
he
did
think
it
likely
that
any
attack
would
take
the
form
of
a
simple
armed
assault
that
would
give
us
time
to
get
off
a
message
he
argued
they
ca
afford
that
gotch
pointed
out
that
neither
could
they
launch
a
missile
while
still
in
space
a
homing
weapon
could
differentiate
between
aztec
baker
and
bandit
he
said
but
they
still
have
to
have
some
sure
fire
method
crag
insisted
you
may
be
right
have
you
a
better
plan
crag
did
and
outlined
it
in
some
detail
gotch
listened
without
comment
until
he
had
finished
could
work
he
said
finally
however
it
going
to
shoot
your
schedule
even
if
you
could
do
it
why
ca
we
you
not
supermen
commander
he
said
tersely
the
psychiatrists
here
inform
us
that
your
crew
as
individuals
should
be
near
the
breaking
point
we
know
the
cumulative
strain
to
be
truthful
with
you
we
been
getting
gray
hair
over
that
prospect
nuts
to
the
psychiatrists
crag
declared
with
a
certainty
he
feel
men
do
break
when
their
survival
depends
on
their
sanity
no
the
single
word
came
across
the
void
soft
and
low
we
can
do
it
crag
persisted
all
right
i
agree
with
the
plan
i
think
you
wrong
but
you
the
commander
in
the
field
his
voice
was
flat
good
luck
he
cut
off
abruptly
crag
looked
at
the
silent
panel
for
a
moment
another
problem
another
solution
required
maybe
gotch
was
right
maybe
they
all
wind
up
as
candidates
for
the
laughing
academy
if
they
lived
long
enough
the
thought
did
cheer
him
well
he
better
get
moving
there
was
a
lot
to
be
done
he
looked
up
and
saw
the
question
in
prochaska
eyes
might
as
well
tell
him
he
thought
he
repeated
the
information
gotch
had
given
together
with
his
plan
prochaska
listened
quietly
nodding
from
time
to
time
when
he
finished
they
discussed
the
pros
and
cons
of
crag
proposed
course
of
action
prochaska
thought
it
would
work
in
the
end
they
decided
to
pursue
the
plan
without
telling
the
others
the
full
story
it
might
be
the
breaking
point
especially
for
nagel
and
they
would
be
needing
a
good
oxygen
man
in
the
coming
days
crag
got
on
the
interphone
and
called
larkwell
who
was
working
in
the
tail
section
with
the
others
judging
from
what
you
seen
of
bandit
how
long
would
it
take
to
make
it
livable
as
crew
quarters
why
he
asked
querulously
i
have
time
to
go
into
that
now
crag
said
evenly
just
give
me
your
best
estimate
you
ca
make
it
livable
it
hot
not
that
hot
you
just
got
the
radiation
creeps
let
have
the
estimate
larkwell
considered
a
moment
there
quite
a
weld
job
on
the
hull
assuming
we
could
get
the
necessary
patch
metal
from
bandit
we
have
to
haul
one
helluva
lot
of
gear
across
that
damned
desert
how
long
crag
cut
in
well
three
days
at
least
but
that
a
minimum
figure
that
the
figure
you
have
to
meet
crag
promised
grimly
start
now
use
nagel
and
richter
load
up
the
gear
you
need
and
get
in
a
trip
before
chow
now
larkwell
voice
was
incredulous
what
about
winding
up
this
job
first
the
airlock
is
damned
important
drop
it
crag
said
briefly
there
was
silence
at
the
other
end
of
the
interphone
okay
the
construction
boss
grumbled
finally
crag
suggested
that
prochaska
make
the
first
trip
with
them
to
look
over
bandit
electronic
gear
he
would
need
to
know
what
repairs
and
modifications
would
be
necessary
to
make
it
usable
the
chief
was
delighted
it
would
mark
the
first
time
he
been
out
of
the
space
cabin
since
the
day
of
their
landing
crag
watched
them
leave
through
the
port
it
was
impossible
to
tell
the
crew
members
apart
in
their
bulky
garments
the
extra
oxygen
and
the
tools
larkwell
had
selected
gave
them
an
odd
shambling
gait
despite
the
low
gravity
they
plodded
in
single
file
winding
slowly
across
the
plain
the
thought
struck
him
that
they
resembled
grotesque
life
forms
from
some
alien
planet
for
just
a
moment
he
felt
sorry
and
a
trifle
guilty
over
assigning
nagel
to
the
trip
the
oxygen
man
was
already
in
a
state
of
perpetual
fatigue
still
he
could
allow
anyone
the
luxury
of
rest
work
was
in
the
cards
grueling
slavish
toil
if
they
were
to
survive
it
struck
crag
that
this
was
a
moment
of
great
risk
of
the
four
figures
plodding
toward
bandit
one
was
an
enemy
one
a
saboteur
yet
what
could
either
accomplish
by
striking
now
nothing
while
i
he
thought
strangely
enough
richter
bothered
him
more
than
the
saboteur
there
was
a
quality
about
the
man
he
could
decipher
an
armor
he
could
penetrate
it
occurred
to
him
that
outwardly
at
least
richter
was
much
like
prochaska
quiet
calm
steady
he
performed
the
tasks
assigned
him
without
question
evinced
no
hostility
no
resentment
he
was
seemingly
oblivious
to
nagel
barbs
and
larkwell
occasional
surly
rebuffs
on
the
face
of
the
record
he
was
an
asset
a
work
horse
who
performed
far
more
labor
than
nagel
he
decided
he
could
write
the
german
off
as
a
factor
to
be
continually
weighed
weighed
and
watched
he
was
no
ordinary
man
of
that
he
was
sure
richter
presence
on
the
enemy
first
moon
rocket
was
ample
testimony
of
his
stature
what
were
his
thoughts
his
plans
what
fires
burned
behind
his
placid
countenance
crag
wished
he
knew
one
thing
was
certain
he
could
never
lower
his
guard
not
for
a
second
he
sighed
and
turned
away
from
the
viewport
a
lot
of
data
had
piled
up
he
give
alpine
a
little
work
to
do
to
get
gotch
off
his
neck
he
reached
for
the
communicator
thinking
of
ann
probably
got
someone
else
lined
up
by
now
he
thought
sourly
work
on
bandit
progressed
slowly
nagel
dragged
through
each
successive
work
shift
on
the
verge
of
exhaustion
crag
expected
him
to
collapse
momentarily
his
disintegration
took
him
further
and
further
from
the
group
he
ate
silently
with
eyes
averted
he
did
protest
the
arduous
hours
but
the
amount
of
work
he
performed
was
negligible
larkwell
maintained
his
stamina
but
had
become
more
quiet
in
the
process
he
seldom
smiled
never
joked
occasionally
he
was
truculent
or
derisive
referring
to
bandit
as
the
commander
hot
box
richter
remained
impersonal
and
aloof
but
performed
his
assigned
tasks
without
apparent
resentment
crag
noticed
that
he
stayed
as
far
from
larkwell
as
possible
perhaps
fearing
violence
from
the
burly
construction
boss
prochaska
alone
maintained
a
cheerful
exterior
for
which
crag
was
thankful
he
was
watching
them
now
the
evening
of
the
last
day
of
estimate
returning
from
the
bandit
the
four
figures
were
strung
out
over
half
a
mile
he
regarded
that
as
a
bad
omen
they
no
longer
worked
as
a
crew
but
as
separate
individuals
each
in
his
separate
world
with
exception
of
prochaska
he
turned
away
from
the
port
with
the
familiar
feeling
that
time
was
running
out
and
mentally
reviewed
what
remained
to
be
done
making
bandit
habitable
was
a
must
there
still
remained
the
arduous
task
of
transferring
their
belongings
and
gear
to
bandit
drone
baker
had
to
be
toppled
and
her
cargo
salvaged
then
there
was
drone
charlie
at
present
just
a
minute
speck
somewhere
in
the
great
void
between
earth
and
her
moon
but
in
somewhat
less
than
hours
it
would
represent
tons
of
metal
hurtling
over
the
rim
of
arzachel
this
time
they
could
fumble
the
ball
the
building
of
the
airlock
in
the
rill
loomed
in
the
immediate
future
an
oppressive
shadow
that
caused
him
no
end
of
worry
there
were
other
problems
too
like
the
item
of
red
dog
the
possible
battle
for
control
of
the
moon
red
dog
in
particular
had
become
the
prime
shadow
darkening
ashy
plains
he
thought
about
the
emotional
deterioration
which
had
laid
an
iron
grip
over
the
expedition
and
wondered
if
they
could
hang
on
through
the
rough
days
ahead
all
in
all
the
task
of
colonizing
the
moon
appeared
an
extremely
formidable
one
he
shook
off
his
apprehensions
and
began
planning
his
next
step
that
evening
crag
knocked
off
the
usual
three
hour
work
period
following
evening
chow
nagel
tumbled
onto
his
pad
and
was
asleep
almost
instantly
his
breathing
was
a
harsh
rasp
at
crag
suggestion
prochaska
took
the
watch
until
midnight
crag
stood
guard
the
remainder
of
the
night
to
allow
nagel
and
larkwell
a
full
night
rest
while
the
others
slept
crag
brooded
at
the
port
once
he
ran
his
hand
over
his
face
surprised
at
the
hardness
all
bone
and
no
flesh
he
thought
he
looked
toward
the
north
wall
of
arzachel
in
a
few
short
hours
drone
charlie
would
come
blazing
over
the
rim
and
red
dog
snapping
at
its
heels
chapter
adam
crag
was
not
a
man
the
minister
stated
his
tone
implied
that
crag
had
been
just
the
opposite
not
a
bit
like
his
parents
the
best
family
guidance
in
the
world
yet
he
quit
sunday
school
almost
before
he
got
started
i
doubt
that
he
ever
been
to
church
since
he
looked
archly
at
the
agent
perhaps
a
godless
world
like
the
moon
is
just
retribution
a
garage
mechanic
a
junk
dealer
and
the
proprietor
of
a
tool
shop
had
a
lot
to
say
about
adam
crag
so
did
the
owner
of
a
small
private
airport
they
remembered
him
as
a
boy
with
an
insatiable
appetite
for
tearing
cars
apart
and
converting
them
to
what
the
junk
dealer
termed
supersonic
jalopies
many
people
in
el
cajon
remembered
adam
crag
strangely
enough
his
teachers
all
the
way
back
through
grade
school
had
little
difficulty
in
recalling
his
antics
and
attitudes
an
elementary
teacher
explained
it
by
saying
he
was
that
kind
of
a
boy
the
family
doctor
had
the
most
to
say
about
adam
he
had
long
since
retired
a
placid
seventyish
man
who
had
elected
to
pass
his
last
years
in
the
same
house
in
an
older
section
of
the
town
in
which
he
been
born
he
sat
swinging
and
talking
reminiscing
about
the
growing
up
of
young
adam
as
he
put
it
the
agent
had
made
himself
at
home
on
the
front
steps
listening
the
doctor
comments
were
little
short
of
being
an
eulogy
he
finished
and
was
silent
tapping
a
black
briar
pipe
against
his
hand
while
he
contemplated
the
agent
with
eyes
which
had
long
since
ceased
to
see
one
other
thing
he
added
finally
adam
was
sure
a
heller
with
the
girls
the
agent
started
to
comment
that
crag
dossier
looked
like
the
roll
call
of
a
girl
dormitory
but
refrained
he
did
want
to
prejudice
the
testimony
zero
hour
on
the
plains
of
arzachel
the
sun
an
intolerably
brilliant
ball
pasted
against
the
ebony
sky
had
started
its
drop
toward
the
horizon
the
shadows
on
the
plain
were
lengthening
harbingers
of
the
bitter
night
to
come
they
crept
out
from
the
sheer
wall
of
the
crater
reaching
to
engulf
pickering
base
with
icy
fingers
crag
and
prochaska
were
alone
now
in
the
stripped
cabin
of
the
aztec
nagel
and
richter
under
larkwell
command
had
departed
for
bandit
an
hour
earlier
with
the
last
of
their
supplies
crag
disliked
splitting
the
crew
but
saw
no
alternative
he
had
to
gamble
the
element
of
certainty
the
ability
to
predict
the
expectations
of
logic
all
these
had
vanished
swept
away
by
the
vagaries
of
chance
they
could
do
only
so
much
beyond
that
their
fate
was
pawn
to
the
chaotic
cross
fires
of
human
elements
pitted
against
the
architecture
of
the
cosmos
they
were
puppets
in
the
last
lottery
of
probability
prochaska
broke
the
silence
it
going
to
be
close
crag
eyes
remained
riveted
to
the
instruments
drone
charlie
and
red
dog
were
plunging
through
space
separated
by
a
scant
flight
time
despite
the
drone
long
launch
lead
the
gap
between
the
two
rockets
had
been
narrowed
to
a
perilous
point
drone
charlie
was
decelerating
rapidly
her
braking
rockets
flaring
spasmodically
to
slow
her
headlong
flight
we
better
get
into
our
suits
crag
said
finally
we
want
to
get
out
of
this
baby
the
second
charlie
lets
down
prochaska
nodded
they
left
their
suits
unpressurized
for
the
time
being
to
allow
full
mobility
in
the
moments
ahead
prochaska
in
particular
could
afford
to
be
hampered
by
the
rigidity
the
suit
possessed
when
under
pressure
they
turned
back
to
the
control
panel
charlie
was
hurtling
over
alphons
dropping
toward
the
bleak
lunar
landscape
with
incredible
speed
the
mechanical
voice
from
alpine
droned
a
stream
of
data
there
was
a
rapid
exchange
of
information
between
prochaska
and
alpine
at
its
conclusion
he
began
taking
over
control
of
the
drone
crag
watched
tensely
prochaska
fingers
even
though
encased
in
the
heavy
suit
material
moved
with
certainty
in
a
little
while
he
spoke
without
looking
up
got
it
he
said
laconically
he
studied
the
instruments
then
his
fingers
sought
the
buttons
controlling
charlie
forward
braking
rockets
crag
thought
is
within
scant
moments
the
drone
had
covered
the
sky
over
the
tangled
land
lying
between
alphons
and
arzachel
it
swept
over
the
brimming
cliffs
at
a
scant
two
thousand
feet
he
saw
the
rocket
through
the
forward
ports
white
vapor
flared
from
its
nose
rockets
the
chief
had
it
under
full
deceleration
the
cloud
of
vapor
covered
its
body
prochaska
moved
the
steering
control
and
the
rocket
slanted
upward
at
angle
of
climb
crag
strained
his
neck
to
keep
it
in
sight
he
thought
its
rate
of
climb
was
too
rapid
but
prochaska
seemed
unperturbed
his
calm
approach
to
the
problem
of
landing
the
drone
gave
crag
renewed
confidence
all
at
once
it
seemed
drone
charlie
was
hanging
high
in
the
sky
a
tapered
needle
miraculously
suspended
in
the
heavens
then
it
began
dropping
dropping
bursts
of
smoke
and
white
vapor
shot
from
its
tail
jets
becoming
continuous
as
the
rocket
hurtled
toward
the
plain
the
drone
was
lost
to
sight
in
its
own
clouds
but
he
charted
its
progress
by
the
vapor
spurts
at
its
lower
edge
prochaska
was
draining
the
tail
braking
jets
of
every
ounce
of
energy
suddenly
the
rocket
gave
the
illusion
of
hanging
in
the
gap
between
it
and
the
stark
terrain
below
seemed
to
have
stopped
closing
crag
half
expected
the
blasting
stern
tubes
to
begin
pushing
the
drone
back
into
the
sky
but
no
it
was
moving
down
again
slowly
prochaska
moved
another
control
a
within
the
rocket
stirred
to
life
and
a
spidery
metal
network
moved
out
from
its
tail
housing
the
drone
dropped
steadily
ever
slower
and
finally
settled
the
frame
folded
was
crushed
at
the
same
instant
prochaska
silenced
its
rockets
it
settled
down
its
tail
tubes
pushed
into
the
plain
powdery
ash
scarcely
a
mile
from
the
aztec
perfect
prochaska
sounded
pleased
with
himself
his
thin
face
broke
into
a
satisfied
smile
nice
going
crag
agreed
now
let
get
out
of
this
trap
his
eyes
lingered
for
an
instant
on
the
analog
red
dog
had
already
cleared
ptolemaeus
he
snapped
his
face
plate
shut
clicked
on
the
interphone
and
turned
the
oxygen
valve
his
suit
began
to
swell
and
grow
rigid
against
his
body
when
they
were
pressurized
he
opened
the
hatch
and
they
clambered
out
onto
the
plain
he
closed
the
hatch
behind
them
and
struck
off
in
the
direction
of
bandit
with
the
chief
at
his
heels
they
moved
as
rapidly
as
possible
their
feet
in
the
heavy
insulated
space
boots
kicked
up
small
fountains
of
dust
which
dropped
as
quickly
as
they
rose
from
time
to
time
crag
looked
back
toward
the
brimming
cliffs
prochaska
plodded
head
down
his
quickened
breathing
in
the
interphones
sounded
harsh
to
crag
plainly
the
long
hours
of
monitoring
the
aztec
instruments
had
made
him
soft
the
microphone
in
his
helmet
came
to
life
it
was
larkwell
red
dog
cleared
the
rim
he
told
them
crag
glanced
back
his
eyes
caught
the
wispish
trail
of
white
vapor
high
above
the
cliffs
before
he
saw
the
rocket
itself
it
was
already
in
vertical
attitude
letting
down
amid
a
cloud
of
white
vapor
from
its
stern
braking
rockets
all
hands
disconnect
their
interphones
he
commanded
from
here
on
out
we
operate
in
silence
the
red
dog
interphone
system
might
or
might
not
be
on
the
same
band
they
used
he
was
about
to
take
that
risk
okay
larkwell
acknowledged
we
shutting
off
crag
remembered
that
the
german
interphones
were
still
connected
slip
one
he
decided
to
leave
his
own
open
at
least
he
be
forewarned
if
anyone
tried
to
alert
the
red
dog
crew
he
turned
back
toward
the
rocket
red
dog
was
dropping
about
two
or
three
miles
from
the
aztec
in
the
direction
of
the
wrecked
baker
white
smoke
and
flame
poured
from
its
stern
tubes
it
slowed
visibly
as
it
neared
the
lunar
surface
he
thought
that
a
plumb
bob
dropped
through
the
long
axis
of
the
rocket
would
form
a
right
angle
with
the
surface
of
arzachel
pilot
good
he
thought
he
watched
until
it
touched
down
teetering
on
its
stern
tubes
for
a
moment
before
coming
to
rest
then
he
turned
and
hurried
to
overtake
prochaska
the
chief
face
behind
his
mask
was
covered
with
perspiration
he
panted
heavily
crag
beckoned
him
to
follow
and
moved
behind
a
low
swale
of
rock
where
they
would
be
safe
from
detection
the
nose
of
bandit
jutted
into
the
sky
about
a
mile
ahead
of
them
he
motioned
toward
it
gesturing
for
prochaska
to
go
on
the
chief
nodded
understanding
and
struck
off
crag
turned
and
began
climbing
a
low
rocky
ridge
that
now
lay
between
him
and
red
dog
he
stopped
just
below
its
crest
and
searched
for
a
safe
vantage
point
to
his
right
a
serrated
rock
structure
extended
up
over
the
backbone
of
the
ridge
he
angled
toward
it
then
followed
the
outcropping
to
a
point
where
he
could
see
the
plain
beyond
red
dog
had
its
tail
planted
in
the
ash
about
three
miles
distant
minute
figures
milled
at
its
base
small
blobs
of
movement
against
the
crater
floor
no
sounds
broke
the
silence
of
crag
open
interphones
he
took
this
as
a
sign
that
the
red
dog
sets
operated
on
a
different
band
but
he
could
be
sure
the
tremendous
advantage
of
having
communication
with
his
own
men
must
be
discarded
his
vigil
was
rewarded
a
few
moments
later
when
the
blobs
around
red
dog
base
began
moving
in
the
direction
of
the
aztec
it
struck
him
that
they
could
see
the
rocket
from
their
present
position
due
to
small
intervening
hillocks
although
both
baker
and
charlie
were
clearly
visible
he
decided
the
aztec
horizontal
position
had
tipped
them
to
its
identity
while
they
were
still
one
of
the
red
dog
crewmen
obviously
the
leader
drew
ahead
of
his
companions
the
other
two
seemed
to
be
struggling
with
some
object
they
carried
between
them
they
moved
close
together
halting
from
time
to
time
he
returned
his
gaze
to
the
rocket
conjecturing
that
another
crewman
would
have
remained
behind
if
so
he
was
in
the
space
cabin
the
ship
seemed
lifeless
the
landing
party
approached
a
small
ridge
overlooking
the
aztec
bringing
them
closer
to
his
lookout
he
saw
that
the
two
men
following
the
leader
were
having
difficulty
with
their
burden
they
walked
slowly
uncertainly
pausing
from
time
to
time
the
lead
man
started
up
the
rocky
knoll
overlooking
the
aztec
his
movements
were
slow
wary
he
crouched
near
the
top
of
the
ridge
scanning
the
plain
beyond
before
waving
to
his
companions
to
follow
the
gesture
told
crag
that
their
interphones
were
disconnected
the
crewmen
near
the
base
of
the
knoll
started
climbing
moving
with
extreme
difficulty
he
watched
them
wondering
until
they
reached
the
leader
they
stood
for
a
moment
scouting
the
plain
then
two
of
the
men
crouched
over
the
burden
they
had
lugged
up
the
knoll
a
weapon
crag
guessed
he
tried
to
discern
its
shape
but
failed
a
few
moments
later
one
of
the
men
stepped
back
a
puff
of
white
rose
from
the
knoll
a
trail
of
vapor
shot
toward
the
aztec
a
portable
rocket
launcher
his
eyes
tracked
the
missile
flight
the
vapor
trail
terminated
at
its
target
an
instant
later
the
aztec
disintegrated
black
chunks
of
the
rocket
hurtled
into
the
lunar
skies
becoming
lost
to
sight
within
seconds
only
a
jagged
few
feet
of
broken
torn
metal
marked
the
site
of
man
first
successful
landing
on
the
moon
what
a
he
thought
it
did
merely
push
a
hole
in
the
aztec
it
disintegrated
it
completely
that
was
one
for
gotch
he
filed
the
thought
away
and
watched
the
figures
on
the
knoll
searched
the
scene
for
a
long
time
finally
they
turned
and
started
back
carrying
the
rocket
launcher
with
them
the
act
of
saving
the
weapon
told
him
that
red
dog
carried
more
rockets
than
just
the
single
shot
fired
a
disconcerting
thought
he
cautiously
withdrew
from
his
post
and
picked
his
way
down
the
ridge
toward
bandit
moving
as
rapidly
as
the
rough
terrain
permitted
everything
now
depended
on
the
next
move
of
the
red
dog
crew
he
thought
one
thing
was
certain
there
would
be
no
quarter
shown
the
ruthless
destruction
of
the
aztec
had
set
the
pattern
for
the
coming
battle
of
arzachel
it
was
a
declaration
of
war
with
all
rules
of
human
warfare
discarded
well
that
was
okay
with
him
he
was
breathing
heavily
by
the
time
he
reached
a
spot
overlooking
bandit
nagel
had
decompressed
the
cabin
and
they
were
waiting
for
him
with
the
hatch
open
he
crossed
the
clearing
and
a
moment
later
was
in
the
space
cabin
he
watched
the
gauge
until
it
was
safe
to
cut
off
his
suit
pressure
and
open
his
face
plate
he
looked
at
richter
his
face
was
blank
tersely
then
he
related
what
had
happened
i
sort
of
expected
that
prochaska
said
quietly
when
he
had
finished
it
was
the
logical
way
logical
to
attempt
to
murder
men
nagel
asked
bitterly
entirely
logical
crag
interjected
the
stakes
are
too
big
for
a
few
human
lives
to
matter
at
least
we
been
warned
he
turned
to
prochaska
disconnect
richter
mikes
until
this
over
the
chief
nodded
richter
stood
quietly
by
while
his
lip
microphone
was
disconnected
and
withdrawn
from
the
helmet
nagel
face
showed
satisfaction
at
the
act
but
larkwell
expression
was
wooden
crag
said
defense
of
bandit
will
be
under
prochaska
command
he
looked
grimly
at
his
your
fort
has
one
automatic
rifle
make
it
count
if
you
have
to
use
it
the
chief
nodded
larkwell
spoke
up
how
about
you
i
be
scouting
with
the
other
automatic
rifle
stay
in
your
suits
and
keep
ready
if
they
start
to
bring
up
the
rocket
launcher
i
signal
if
that
happens
you
have
to
get
out
of
here
pronto
you
better
check
your
oxygen
he
added
as
an
afterthought
if
they
think
we
dead
ducks
they
wo
be
toting
the
launcher
prochaska
said
we
hope
crag
exchanged
his
oxygen
cylinder
for
a
fresh
one
then
checked
one
of
the
automatic
rifles
slipping
two
extra
clips
in
his
belt
on
second
thought
he
hooked
a
spare
oxygen
cylinder
to
the
back
straps
he
nodded
to
nagel
snapped
his
face
plate
shut
and
pressurized
his
suit
when
the
cabin
was
decompressed
he
opened
the
hatch
scanning
the
knoll
carefully
before
descending
to
the
plain
he
struck
off
toward
the
ridge
overlooking
red
dog
the
ground
on
this
side
of
the
spur
was
fairly
flat
and
he
made
good
time
but
was
panting
heavily
by
the
time
he
reached
his
lookout
point
on
the
crest
chapter
crag
sighted
the
red
dog
party
immediately
three
figures
plodding
in
single
file
toward
drone
baker
he
saw
with
satisfaction
that
they
had
discarded
the
rocket
launcher
he
took
that
as
a
sign
they
believed
the
aztec
crew
dead
he
found
a
halfway
comfortable
sitting
position
and
settled
back
to
await
developments
the
distant
figures
moved
across
the
plain
with
maddening
slowness
from
time
to
time
he
returned
his
eyes
to
the
enemy
rocket
it
showed
no
signs
of
life
once
he
debated
taking
the
gamble
of
trying
to
reach
it
but
as
quickly
discarded
the
idea
caught
on
the
open
plain
and
he
be
a
gone
gosling
he
waited
after
what
seemed
a
long
while
the
invaders
reached
a
point
overlooking
drone
baker
one
of
the
figures
remained
on
a
small
rise
overlooking
the
drone
while
the
other
two
separated
and
approached
it
from
different
directions
the
tactic
disquieted
him
it
indicated
that
the
newcomers
were
not
entirely
convinced
that
they
were
alone
in
crater
arzachel
after
another
interminably
long
time
the
two
figures
approaching
the
rocket
met
at
its
base
they
walked
around
the
rocket
several
times
then
struck
out
this
time
toward
drone
charlie
their
companion
left
his
lookout
point
and
cut
across
the
plain
to
join
them
crag
squirmed
uncomfortably
he
was
tired
and
hungry
his
muscles
ached
from
the
constriction
of
the
suit
his
body
was
hot
and
clammy
and
perspiration
from
his
brow
stung
his
eyes
he
sighed
wishing
he
had
a
cigarette
strange
he
had
smoked
in
over
a
year
but
all
at
once
the
need
for
tobacco
seemed
overwhelming
he
pushed
the
thought
aside
the
invaders
were
strung
out
in
single
file
moving
in
a
direction
which
brought
them
closer
to
his
position
he
shifted
to
a
point
below
the
crest
moving
slowly
to
avoid
detection
their
path
crossed
his
field
of
vision
at
a
distance
of
about
half
a
mile
at
the
closest
point
he
saw
they
carried
rifles
in
shoulder
slings
he
took
this
as
another
indication
they
suspected
the
presence
of
survivors
the
invaders
stopped
and
rested
at
a
point
almost
opposite
him
he
fidgeted
trying
to
get
his
body
into
a
more
comfortable
position
finally
they
resumed
their
trek
before
they
reached
the
drone
they
halted
one
man
remained
in
the
cover
of
a
spur
of
rock
while
the
other
two
separated
and
advanced
on
the
drone
from
different
directions
crag
cursed
under
his
breath
they
certainly
were
going
to
be
sitting
ducks
perhaps
it
was
just
a
precaution
simply
good
infantry
tactics
he
told
himself
but
it
still
raised
a
complication
he
waited
the
two
invaders
closed
on
the
drone
meeting
at
its
base
they
evidently
decided
it
was
abandoned
for
they
left
within
a
few
minutes
walking
to
join
their
waiting
companion
after
a
short
huddle
they
struck
out
in
the
direction
of
bandit
this
was
the
move
he
had
waited
for
he
withdrew
to
the
lee
side
of
the
ridge
and
picked
his
way
toward
bandit
as
rapidly
as
possible
taking
care
not
to
brush
against
the
sharp
slivers
of
rock
he
drew
near
the
rocket
thinking
that
the
open
hatch
would
be
a
dead
giveaway
still
there
was
no
alternative
a
fort
without
a
gunport
was
no
fort
at
all
he
climbed
to
a
spot
close
to
the
crest
of
the
ridge
and
peered
back
in
the
direction
of
the
invaders
startled
to
find
they
were
nearer
than
he
had
supposed
he
hastily
withdrew
his
head
deciding
it
was
too
late
to
warn
the
others
to
abandon
the
rocket
if
the
invaders
climbed
straight
up
the
opposite
side
of
the
ridge
they
conceivably
could
catch
his
crew
on
the
open
plain
that
made
another
complication
he
scanned
the
ridge
off
to
his
right
a
series
of
granite
spurs
jutted
from
the
base
rock
in
finger
formation
he
picked
his
way
toward
them
then
descended
until
he
found
shelter
between
two
rock
outcroppings
which
gave
him
a
clear
view
of
bandit
he
checked
his
automatic
rifle
moving
the
control
lever
to
the
position
the
black
rectangle
that
marked
bandit
hatch
seemed
lifeless
he
waited
long
minutes
passed
he
cursed
the
eternal
silence
of
the
moon
which
robbed
him
of
the
use
of
his
ears
a
cannon
could
fire
within
an
inch
of
his
back
and
he
never
know
it
he
thought
he
moved
his
head
slightly
forward
from
time
to
time
in
an
effort
to
see
the
slope
behind
him
nothing
happened
his
body
itched
intolerably
from
perspiration
he
readjusted
the
suit
temperature
setting
gaining
a
slight
respite
from
the
heat
all
at
once
he
caught
movement
out
of
the
corner
of
his
face
plate
and
involuntarily
jerked
his
head
back
he
waited
a
moment
aware
that
his
heart
was
pounding
heavily
then
cautiously
moved
forward
one
of
the
invaders
was
picking
his
way
down
the
slope
in
a
path
that
would
take
him
within
thirty
yards
of
his
position
the
man
moved
slowly
keeping
his
rifle
cradled
across
his
arm
they
know
he
thought
the
open
hatch
was
the
giveaway
he
anxiously
searched
bandit
no
sign
of
life
was
visible
he
gave
silent
thanks
that
the
invaders
had
not
lugged
their
rocket
launcher
with
them
prochaska
he
knew
would
be
watching
crouched
in
the
shadow
of
the
hatch
opening
behind
the
heavy
automatic
rifle
he
estimated
the
distance
between
the
base
of
the
slope
and
the
rocket
at
yards
close
enough
for
prochaska
to
pick
off
anyone
who
ventured
onto
the
plain
he
waited
while
the
invader
passed
abreast
of
him
and
descended
to
the
base
of
the
plain
taking
cover
in
the
rocks
he
halted
there
and
looked
back
a
few
moments
later
crag
saw
the
second
of
the
invaders
moving
down
the
slope
about
a
hundred
yards
beyond
his
companion
he
too
stopped
near
the
base
of
the
rocks
where
was
the
third
man
the
same
technique
they
used
before
crag
decided
he
would
be
covering
his
companions
advance
from
the
ridge
that
made
it
more
difficult
he
studied
the
two
men
at
the
edge
of
the
plain
it
looked
like
a
stalemate
they
either
had
to
advance
or
retreat
their
time
was
governed
by
oxygen
if
they
advanced
they
be
dead
pigeons
prochaska
could
miss
if
they
chose
to
cross
the
clearing
as
it
was
neither
side
could
get
a
clear
shot
at
the
distance
separating
them
although
the
invaders
could
pour
a
stream
of
shells
into
the
open
hatch
but
prochaska
would
be
aware
of
that
danger
and
would
have
taken
refuge
to
one
side
of
the
opening
he
decided
there
was
another
complication
the
shells
were
heavy
enough
to
perforate
the
rocket
well
he
worry
about
that
later
he
moved
his
head
for
a
better
view
of
the
invaders
the
man
nearest
him
had
gotten
into
a
prone
position
and
was
doing
something
with
the
end
of
his
rifle
crag
watched
puzzled
suddenly
the
man
brought
the
rifle
to
his
shoulder
and
he
saw
that
the
end
of
the
muzzle
was
bulged
rifle
grenade
damn
they
brought
a
regular
arsenal
if
he
managed
to
place
one
in
the
open
hatch
the
bandit
crew
was
doomed
heedless
of
the
other
two
red
dog
crewmen
he
stepped
out
between
the
shoulders
of
rock
to
gain
freedom
of
movement
and
snapped
his
own
weapon
to
his
shoulder
he
had
trouble
fitting
his
finger
into
the
trigger
guard
the
enemy
was
spraddled
on
his
stomach
legs
apart
adjusting
his
body
to
steady
his
weapon
crag
moved
his
weapon
up
bringing
the
prone
man
squarely
into
his
sights
he
squeezed
the
trigger
feeling
the
weapon
jump
against
his
padded
shoulder
and
leaped
back
into
the
protective
cover
of
rock
something
struck
his
face
plate
splinter
of
rock
he
thought
the
watcher
on
the
ridge
had
been
asleep
he
dropped
to
his
knees
and
crawled
between
the
rock
spurs
to
gain
a
new
position
the
sharp
needle
fragments
under
his
hands
and
knees
troubled
him
one
small
rip
and
be
the
late
adam
crag
he
finally
reached
a
place
where
he
could
see
the
lower
end
of
the
ridge
the
man
he
shot
was
a
motionless
blob
on
the
rocky
floor
his
arms
and
legs
pulled
up
in
a
grotesque
fetal
position
the
vulnerability
of
human
life
on
the
moon
struck
crag
forcibly
a
bullet
hole
anywhere
meant
sudden
violent
death
a
hit
on
the
finger
was
as
fatal
as
a
shot
through
the
heart
once
air
pressure
in
a
suit
was
lost
a
man
was
dead
horribly
dying
within
seconds
a
pinhole
in
the
suit
was
enough
to
do
it
his
eyes
searched
for
the
dead
man
companions
the
ridge
and
plain
seemed
utterly
lifeless
bandit
was
a
black
canted
monolith
rising
above
the
plain
seeming
to
symbolize
the
utter
desolation
and
silence
of
crater
arzachel
for
a
moment
he
was
fascinated
the
very
scene
portended
death
it
was
an
eery
feeling
he
shook
it
off
and
waited
he
was
finally
rewarded
by
movement
a
portion
of
rock
near
the
edge
of
the
plain
seemed
to
rise
took
shape
the
dead
man
companion
had
risen
to
a
kneeling
position
holding
his
rifle
to
his
shoulder
crag
raised
his
gun
wondering
if
he
could
hold
the
man
in
his
sights
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
to
a
rifleman
clothed
in
a
cumbersome
space
suit
seemed
a
long
way
before
he
could
pull
the
trigger
the
man
flung
his
arms
outward
clawing
at
his
throat
for
an
instant
before
slumping
to
the
rocks
it
took
crag
a
second
to
comprehend
what
had
happened
prochaska
had
been
ready
a
figure
suddenly
filled
the
dark
rectangle
of
bandit
pointing
toward
the
ridge
behind
crag
he
apparently
was
trying
to
tell
him
something
crag
scanned
the
ridge
it
seemed
deserted
he
turned
toward
bandit
and
motioned
toward
his
faceplate
the
other
understood
his
interphones
crackled
to
life
prochaska
voice
was
welcome
i
see
him
he
broke
in
he
moving
up
the
slope
to
your
right
trying
to
reach
the
top
of
the
ridge
too
far
for
a
shot
he
added
crag
scrambled
into
a
clearing
and
scanned
the
ridge
just
in
time
to
see
a
figure
disappear
over
the
skyline
he
started
up
the
slope
in
a
beeline
for
the
crest
if
he
could
reach
it
in
time
he
might
prevent
the
sniper
from
crossing
the
open
plain
which
lay
between
the
ridge
and
red
dog
cops
and
robbers
he
thought
another
childhood
game
had
suddenly
been
recreated
this
time
on
the
bleak
plain
of
an
airless
alien
crater
miles
from
the
sunny
southern
california
lands
of
his
youth
crag
reached
the
ridge
the
plain
on
the
other
side
seemed
devoid
of
life
in
the
distance
the
squat
needle
that
was
red
dog
jutted
above
the
ashy
plain
an
incongruous
human
artifact
lost
on
the
wastelands
of
the
moon
only
its
symmetry
distinguished
it
from
the
jagged
monolithic
structures
that
dotted
this
end
of
the
crater
floor
he
searched
the
slope
movement
far
down
the
knoll
to
his
right
caught
his
eye
the
fugitive
was
trying
to
reach
a
point
beyond
range
of
crag
weapon
before
cutting
across
the
plain
he
studied
the
terrain
far
ahead
and
to
the
left
of
the
invader
the
crater
floor
became
broken
by
bizarre
rock
formations
of
backbone
ridge
a
great
which
arced
back
toward
red
dog
he
guessed
that
the
fantastic
land
ahead
was
the
fugitive
goal
he
cut
recklessly
down
the
opposite
slope
and
gained
the
floor
of
the
crater
before
turning
in
the
direction
he
had
last
seen
the
invader
he
cursed
himself
for
having
lost
sight
of
him
momentarily
he
slowed
his
pace
thinking
he
was
ripe
for
a
bushwhacking
job
his
eyes
roved
the
terrain
no
movement
no
sign
of
his
quarry
he
moved
quickly
but
warily
attempting
to
search
every
inch
of
the
twisted
rock
formations
covering
the
slope
ahead
his
eye
detected
movement
off
to
one
side
at
the
same
instant
a
warning
sounded
in
his
brain
and
he
flung
himself
downward
and
to
the
side
hitting
the
rough
ground
with
a
sickening
thud
he
sensed
that
the
action
had
saved
his
life
he
crawled
between
some
rock
outcroppings
hugging
the
ground
until
he
reached
a
vantage
point
overlooking
the
area
ahead
he
waited
trying
to
search
the
slope
without
exposing
his
position
minutes
passed
he
tossed
his
head
restlessly
his
eyes
roved
the
plain
searching
attempting
to
discern
movement
no
movement
only
a
world
of
still
the
plain
its
rocks
and
rills
stretched
before
him
barren
and
endless
strange
he
thought
there
should
be
vultures
in
the
sky
and
on
the
plain
creosote
bushes
purple
sage
cactus
coyotes
and
rattlesnakes
but
no
this
was
an
desert
one
spawned
in
the
fires
of
hell
a
land
of
scalding
heat
and
unbelievable
cold
he
thought
it
was
like
a
painting
by
some
mad
artist
first
he
had
sketched
in
the
plain
with
infinite
care
a
monotonous
unbroken
expanse
afterward
he
had
splashed
in
the
rocks
painting
with
wild
abandon
heedless
of
design
form
or
structure
until
the
plain
was
a
hodgepodge
of
bizarre
formations
they
towered
squatted
pierced
the
sky
crawled
along
the
plain
like
giant
serpents
an
orgy
in
rock
without
rhyme
or
reason
somewhere
in
the
lithic
jungle
his
quarry
waited
he
would
flush
him
out
he
thought
that
the
sniper
must
be
getting
low
on
oxygen
he
afford
to
waste
time
he
had
to
reach
red
dog
soon
if
he
were
to
live
crag
checked
his
oxygen
meter
and
began
moving
forward
conscious
that
the
chase
would
be
governed
by
his
oxygen
supply
he
have
to
remember
that
he
reached
a
clearing
on
the
slope
just
as
the
sniper
disappeared
into
the
rock
shadows
on
the
opposite
side
he
hesitated
would
the
pursued
man
be
waiting
covering
the
trail
behind
him
he
decided
not
to
chance
crossing
it
and
began
skirting
around
its
edge
fretting
at
the
minutes
wasted
his
earphones
crackled
and
prochaska
voice
came
a
warning
through
the
vacuum
nagel
says
your
oxygen
must
be
low
he
glanced
at
the
indicator
on
his
cylinder
still
safe
he
studied
the
rocks
ahead
and
told
prochaska
i
got
to
keep
this
baby
from
reaching
red
dog
watch
yourself
do
go
beyond
the
point
of
no
return
voice
held
concern
stop
worrying
crag
pushed
around
the
edge
of
the
clearing
with
reckless
haste
it
was
hard
going
and
he
was
panting
heavily
long
before
he
reached
the
spot
where
he
had
last
seen
the
sniper
he
paused
to
catch
his
breath
the
slope
fell
away
beneath
him
a
miniature
kingdom
of
jagged
rock
there
was
no
sign
of
the
fugitive
the
plain
too
was
devoid
of
life
he
descended
to
the
edge
of
the
clearing
and
picked
his
way
through
the
debris
of
some
geologic
catastrophe
ahead
and
to
the
left
of
the
ridge
the
plain
was
broken
by
shallow
rills
and
weird
rock
outcroppings
farther
out
backbone
ridge
began
as
low
mounds
of
stone
becoming
twisted
black
stalagmites
hunched
incongruously
against
the
floor
of
the
crater
ending
as
jagged
sharp
needles
of
rock
curving
over
the
plain
in
a
huge
arc
a
moment
later
he
caught
sight
of
his
quarry
the
invader
had
cut
down
to
the
edge
of
the
plain
abandoning
the
protection
of
the
ridge
making
a
beeline
for
the
nearest
rock
extrusion
on
the
floor
of
the
crater
too
far
away
for
a
shot
crag
cursed
and
made
a
quick
judgment
deciding
to
risk
the
open
terrain
in
hopes
of
gaining
shelter
before
the
sniper
was
aware
of
his
strategy
he
abandoned
the
protection
of
the
slope
and
struck
out
in
a
straight
line
toward
the
distant
mounds
on
the
floor
of
the
crater
keeping
his
eyes
on
the
fugitive
they
raced
across
the
clearing
in
parallel
paths
several
hundred
yards
apart
the
sniper
had
almost
reached
the
first
rocks
when
he
glanced
back
he
saw
crag
and
put
on
an
extra
burst
of
speed
reaching
the
first
rocks
while
crag
was
still
a
hundred
yards
from
the
nearest
mound
crag
dropped
to
the
ground
thankful
that
it
was
slightly
uneven
at
best
he
make
a
poor
target
he
crawled
keeping
his
body
low
tossing
his
head
in
an
effort
to
shake
the
perspiration
from
his
eyes
how
you
doing
skipper
it
was
prochaska
lousy
crag
thought
he
briefed
him
without
slowing
his
pace
the
ashy
plain
just
in
front
of
him
spurted
in
little
fountains
of
white
dust
he
dropped
flat
on
his
belly
with
a
gasp
you
all
right
okay
crag
gritted
this
boy
just
using
me
for
target
practice
prochaska
voice
became
alarmed
he
urged
him
to
retreat
we
can
get
them
some
other
way
he
said
not
if
they
once
get
that
launcher
in
operation
i
moving
on
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
okay
skipper
but
watch
yourself
his
voice
was
reluctant
and
watch
your
oxygen
roger
he
checked
his
gauge
and
hurriedly
switched
to
the
second
cylinder
now
he
was
on
the
last
one
the
trick
would
be
to
stretch
his
oxygen
out
until
the
chase
was
ended
until
the
man
ahead
was
a
corpse
he
clung
to
the
floor
of
the
crater
searching
for
shelter
the
ground
rose
slightly
to
his
right
he
crawled
toward
the
rise
noting
that
the
terrain
crested
high
enough
to
cut
his
view
of
the
base
of
the
rocks
satisfied
that
he
was
no
longer
visible
he
began
inching
his
way
toward
the
nearest
mounds
chapter
crag
studied
the
scene
he
lay
at
one
end
of
the
great
crescent
of
rock
forming
backbone
ridge
the
other
end
of
which
ended
about
half
a
mile
from
red
dog
the
floor
of
the
crater
between
the
rocket
and
the
nearest
rock
formations
was
fairly
level
and
unbroken
the
arced
formation
itself
was
a
veritable
jungle
of
rocks
of
every
type
gnarled
twisted
rock
that
hugged
the
ground
jutting
black
pinnacles
piercing
the
sky
bizarre
bubble
formations
which
appeared
like
weird
ebony
eskimo
cities
and
great
fantastic
ledges
which
extruded
from
the
earth
at
varying
angles
forming
black
caves
against
their
bases
whole
armies
could
hide
there
he
thought
only
the
fugitive
hide
oxygen
was
still
the
paramount
issue
he
have
to
thread
his
way
through
the
terrible
rock
jungle
to
the
distant
tip
of
the
crescent
then
plunge
across
the
open
plain
to
the
rocket
if
he
hoped
to
survive
the
distance
between
the
horns
of
the
crescent
appeared
about
three
miles
he
pondered
it
thoughtfully
then
got
on
the
interphones
and
outlined
his
plan
to
prochaska
okay
i
know
better
than
to
argue
the
chief
said
dolefully
when
he
had
finished
but
watch
your
oxygen
damn
the
oxygen
crag
thought
irritably
he
studied
the
labyrinth
of
rock
into
which
his
quarry
had
vanished
then
rose
and
started
across
the
plain
in
a
direct
line
for
the
opposite
tip
of
the
crescent
the
first
moments
were
the
hardest
after
that
he
knew
he
must
be
almost
out
of
range
of
the
sniper
weapon
perhaps
even
the
other
had
not
seen
his
maneuver
he
forced
himself
into
a
slow
trot
his
breath
whistling
in
his
ears
and
his
body
sodden
inside
his
suit
perspiration
stung
his
eyes
his
leg
muscles
ached
almost
intolerably
and
every
movement
seemed
made
on
sheer
will
power
the
whimsical
thought
crossed
his
mind
that
gotch
had
never
painted
this
side
of
the
picture
nor
was
it
mentioned
in
the
manual
of
space
survival
he
was
thankful
that
the
plain
between
the
two
tips
of
the
crescent
was
fairly
even
he
moved
quickly
but
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
reached
the
further
tip
of
the
crescent
he
wondered
if
he
had
been
observed
from
red
dog
well
no
matter
he
thought
he
had
cut
the
sniper
sole
avenue
of
escape
victory
over
his
quarry
was
just
a
matter
of
time
a
matter
of
waiting
for
him
to
appear
he
picked
a
vantage
point
a
high
rocky
ledge
which
commanded
all
approaches
to
his
position
after
briefing
prochaska
he
settled
back
to
wait
thinking
that
the
fugitive
must
be
extremely
low
on
oxygen
long
minutes
passed
once
or
twice
he
thought
he
saw
movement
among
the
rocks
and
started
to
lift
his
rifle
but
there
was
no
movement
illusions
he
told
himself
his
eyes
were
playing
him
tricks
the
bizarre
sea
of
rocks
confronting
him
was
a
study
in
black
and
white
the
intolerable
light
of
surfaces
contrasting
with
the
stygian
blackness
of
the
shadows
his
eyes
began
to
ache
and
he
shifted
them
from
time
to
time
to
shut
out
the
glare
he
was
sweating
again
and
there
was
a
dull
ache
at
the
back
of
his
head
precious
time
was
fleeing
have
to
resolve
the
chase
soon
all
at
once
he
saw
movement
that
was
not
an
illusion
he
half
rose
raising
his
rifle
when
dust
spurted
from
the
ground
a
few
feet
to
his
left
he
cursed
and
threw
himself
to
the
ground
rolling
until
he
was
well
below
the
ridge
one
thing
was
certain
the
sniper
had
the
ridge
well
under
control
the
red
dog
watcher
must
have
warned
him
he
thought
he
looked
around
off
to
one
side
a
small
rill
cut
through
the
rocks
running
in
the
sniper
general
direction
he
looked
back
toward
the
ridge
hesitated
then
decided
to
gamble
on
the
rill
he
moved
crablike
along
the
side
of
the
slope
until
he
reached
its
edge
and
peered
over
the
bottom
was
a
pool
of
darkness
he
lowered
himself
over
the
edge
with
some
misgivings
searching
for
holds
with
his
hands
and
feet
his
boot
unexpectedly
touched
bottom
crag
stood
for
a
moment
on
the
floor
of
the
rill
his
body
was
clothed
in
black
velvet
shadows
but
it
was
shallow
enough
to
leave
his
head
in
the
sunlight
he
moved
cautiously
forward
half
expecting
the
sniper
to
appear
in
front
of
him
his
nerves
were
taut
edgy
boy
you
strung
like
a
he
told
himself
it
a
bend
in
the
rill
cut
off
the
sun
leaving
him
in
a
well
of
blackness
he
had
counted
on
that
before
he
moved
another
dozen
steps
he
realized
the
rill
was
the
answer
he
have
to
chance
getting
back
into
the
open
more
time
was
lost
he
felt
the
steep
sides
until
he
located
a
series
of
breaks
in
the
wall
then
slung
his
rifle
over
his
shoulder
and
inched
upward
until
his
head
cleared
the
edge
the
sudden
glare
blinded
him
involuntarily
he
jerked
his
head
sideways
almost
losing
his
hold
in
the
process
he
clung
to
the
wall
for
a
moment
before
laboriously
pulling
his
body
over
the
edge
he
lay
prone
against
the
rocks
to
be
greeted
by
a
hail
of
bullets
he
waited
quietly
without
moving
then
carefully
raised
his
head
off
to
one
side
was
a
series
of
mounds
he
crawled
toward
them
without
moving
his
belly
from
the
ground
when
he
reached
the
first
one
he
half
rose
and
scuttled
forward
until
he
found
a
view
of
the
twisted
rocks
where
he
had
last
seen
the
sniper
the
scene
ahead
was
a
painting
it
seemed
incongruous
that
somewhere
among
the
quiet
rocks
death
moved
in
the
form
of
a
man
he
decided
against
penetrating
further
into
the
tangle
of
rocks
he
wait
he
settled
back
conscious
that
time
was
fleeing
skipper
are
you
checking
your
oxygen
the
chief
voice
rattled
against
his
eardrums
it
was
filled
with
alarm
listen
i
have
no
time
crag
started
to
growl
his
words
were
clipped
short
as
his
eyes
involuntarily
took
the
reading
of
his
oxygen
gauge
low
low
he
calculated
quickly
he
was
well
past
the
point
of
no
return
too
low
to
make
the
long
trip
back
to
bandit
he
was
done
gone
a
plucked
gosling
he
had
bought
himself
a
coffin
and
he
rest
there
for
all
eternity
boxed
in
by
the
weird
tombstones
of
crater
arzachel
adam
crag
the
man
in
the
moon
he
grinned
wryly
well
at
least
his
quarry
was
going
with
him
he
would
greet
his
maker
empty
handed
he
tersely
informed
prochaska
of
his
predicament
then
recklessly
moved
to
a
high
vantage
point
and
scanned
the
rocks
beyond
he
had
to
make
every
second
count
light
and
shadow
light
and
shadow
somewhere
in
the
crisscross
of
light
and
shadow
was
a
a
blob
of
protoplasm
like
himself
a
living
thing
that
had
to
be
stamped
out
before
the
last
of
his
precious
oxygen
was
gone
he
was
the
executioner
somewhere
ahead
a
doomed
man
waited
in
the
docks
waited
for
him
to
come
they
were
two
men
from
opposite
sides
of
the
world
battling
to
death
in
hell
own
backyard
only
he
win
win
before
he
died
he
was
scanning
the
rocky
tableau
when
the
sniper
moved
into
his
field
of
vision
far
to
one
side
of
crag
position
he
was
running
with
short
choppy
steps
threading
between
the
rocks
toward
red
dog
his
haste
and
apparent
disregard
of
exposing
himself
puzzled
crag
for
a
moment
then
he
smiled
grimly
almost
out
of
oxygen
he
thought
well
that
makes
two
of
us
but
he
still
had
to
make
sure
his
quarry
died
the
thought
spurred
him
to
action
he
turned
and
scrambled
back
toward
the
tip
of
backbone
ridge
to
cut
the
sniper
escape
route
he
reached
the
end
rocks
and
waited
a
few
moments
later
he
sighted
a
figure
scrambling
toward
him
he
raised
his
rifle
thinking
it
was
too
far
for
a
shot
then
lowered
it
again
the
sniper
began
moving
more
slowly
and
cautiously
then
became
lost
to
sight
in
a
maze
of
rock
outcroppings
crag
waited
impatiently
aware
that
precious
moments
were
fleeing
he
was
afraid
to
look
at
his
gauge
plagued
by
the
sense
of
vanishing
moments
time
was
running
out
and
eternity
was
drawing
near
near
to
adam
crag
as
well
as
the
sniper
the
rocks
extended
before
him
a
kaleidoscopic
pattern
of
black
and
white
somewhere
in
the
tortuous
labyrinth
was
the
man
he
had
to
kill
before
he
himself
died
he
watched
nervously
trying
to
suppress
the
tension
pulling
at
his
muscles
a
nerve
in
his
cheek
twitched
and
he
shook
his
head
without
removing
his
eyes
from
the
rocks
ahead
still
there
was
no
sign
of
the
other
who
was
the
stalker
and
who
was
the
stalked
the
question
bothered
him
perhaps
even
at
that
instant
the
sniper
was
drawing
bead
then
he
be
free
to
reach
red
dog
safety
crag
decided
he
could
wait
he
have
to
seek
the
other
out
somehow
flush
him
from
cover
he
looked
around
off
to
one
side
a
shelf
of
black
rock
angled
incongruously
into
the
sky
its
sides
were
steep
but
its
top
would
command
all
approaches
to
the
tip
of
the
crescent
he
made
his
way
to
the
base
of
the
shelf
and
began
scrambling
up
its
steep
sides
finding
it
difficult
to
manage
toe
and
hand
holds
he
slipped
from
time
to
time
hanging
desperately
on
to
keep
himself
from
rolling
back
to
the
rocks
below
just
below
the
top
he
rested
panting
fighting
for
breath
conscious
of
his
heart
thudding
in
his
ears
he
had
to
hurry
slowly
laboriously
he
pulled
himself
up
the
last
few
feet
and
lay
panting
atop
the
shelf
none
too
soon
the
sniper
scrambled
out
of
the
rocks
a
scant
hundred
yards
from
crag
position
he
raised
his
rifle
then
hesitated
the
red
dog
crewman
had
fallen
to
his
hands
and
knees
and
was
fighting
to
rise
he
pushed
his
hands
against
the
plain
in
an
attempt
to
get
his
feet
under
him
crag
lowered
his
rifle
and
watched
curiously
the
sniper
finally
succeeded
in
getting
to
his
feet
he
stood
for
a
moment
weaving
before
moving
toward
crag
shelf
with
a
faltering
zigzag
gait
crag
raised
the
rifle
and
tried
to
line
the
sights
he
had
difficulty
holding
the
weapon
steady
he
started
to
pull
the
trigger
when
the
man
fell
again
crag
hesitated
the
sniper
floundered
in
the
ash
managed
to
pull
himself
he
weaved
with
a
few
faltering
steps
and
plunged
forward
on
his
face
crag
watched
for
a
moment
there
was
no
movement
the
black
blob
of
the
suit
lay
with
the
stillness
of
the
rocks
in
the
brazen
heat
of
the
crater
so
that
the
way
a
man
dies
when
his
oxygen
runs
out
he
thought
he
just
plops
down
jerks
a
little
and
departs
with
as
little
ceremony
as
that
he
grinned
crookedly
thinking
he
had
just
watched
a
rehearsal
of
his
own
demise
he
watched
for
a
moment
longer
before
turning
his
face
back
toward
the
plain
red
dog
was
a
bare
away
a
clear
level
from
the
tip
of
backbone
ridge
that
how
close
the
sniper
had
come
to
living
he
mulled
the
thought
with
a
momentary
surge
of
hope
red
dog
why
not
if
he
could
shoot
his
way
into
the
space
cabin
he
live
live
the
thought
galvanized
him
to
action
he
slung
his
rifle
over
his
shoulder
and
scrambled
down
the
slope
heedless
of
the
danger
of
ripping
his
suit
he
could
make
it
he
had
to
make
it
he
gained
the
bottom
and
paused
to
catch
his
breath
before
starting
toward
the
rocket
a
glance
at
his
oxygen
meter
told
him
that
the
race
was
futile
still
he
forced
his
legs
into
a
run
threading
through
the
rocks
toward
the
floor
of
the
crater
he
reached
the
tip
of
the
crescent
panting
heavily
and
plunged
across
the
level
floor
of
the
plain
his
legs
were
leaden
his
lungs
burned
and
sweat
filled
his
eyes
stinging
and
blurring
his
vision
still
he
ran
the
rocket
rose
from
the
crater
floor
growing
larger
larger
he
tried
to
keep
in
a
straight
path
aware
that
he
was
moving
in
a
crazy
zigzag
course
the
rocket
loomed
bigger
bigger
it
appeared
immense
caution
he
told
himself
there
an
hombre
up
there
with
a
rifle
he
halted
feeling
his
body
weave
and
tried
to
steady
himself
high
up
in
the
nose
of
red
dog
the
hatch
was
a
dancing
black
shadow
black
with
movement
he
pulled
the
rifle
from
his
shoulder
and
moved
the
control
to
full
automatic
falling
to
his
knees
as
he
did
so
strange
the
ashy
floor
of
the
crater
was
erupting
in
small
fountains
just
to
his
side
danger
he
thought
take
cover
the
warning
bells
were
still
ringing
in
his
brain
as
he
slid
forward
on
his
stomach
and
tried
to
steady
his
weapon
dust
spurted
across
his
face
plate
the
black
rectangle
of
the
hatch
danced
crazily
in
his
sights
he
pulled
back
on
the
trigger
feeling
the
heavy
weapon
buck
against
his
shoulder
firing
until
the
clip
was
empty
his
fingers
hurriedly
searched
his
belt
for
the
spare
clips
gone
somehow
he
lost
them
he
have
to
rush
the
rocket
he
got
to
his
feet
weaving
dizzily
and
forced
his
legs
to
move
once
or
twice
he
fell
regaining
his
feet
with
difficulty
he
heard
a
voice
it
took
him
a
minute
to
realize
it
was
his
own
he
was
babbling
to
prochaska
trying
to
tell
him
the
sky
was
black
no
it
was
white
dazzling
white
white
with
heat
red
with
flame
he
saw
red
dog
with
difficulty
the
rocket
was
a
hotel
complete
with
room
clerk
he
laughed
inanely
a
single
please
no
only
be
staying
for
the
night
he
fell
again
this
time
it
took
him
longer
to
regain
his
feet
he
stumbled
walked
stumbled
his
eyes
sought
the
rocket
it
was
weaving
swaying
back
and
forth
foolish
he
thought
there
was
no
wind
in
crater
arzachel
no
air
no
wind
no
nothing
nothing
but
death
wait
there
was
someone
sitting
on
top
of
the
rocket
a
giant
of
a
man
with
a
long
white
beard
he
watched
crag
and
smiled
he
reached
out
a
hand
and
beckoned
crag
ran
the
sky
exploded
within
his
brain
his
legs
buckled
and
he
felt
his
face
plate
smash
against
the
ashy
floor
for
all
eternity
he
thought
the
blackness
came
adam
crag
opened
his
eyes
he
was
lying
on
his
back
above
him
the
dome
of
the
sky
formed
a
great
black
canopy
sprinkled
with
brilliant
stars
his
thoughts
chaotic
memories
gradually
stabilized
and
he
remembered
his
mad
flight
toward
red
dog
this
could
be
death
he
thought
spirits
did
wear
space
suits
he
sensed
movement
and
twisted
his
head
to
one
side
gordon
nagel
the
oxygen
man
face
behind
the
heavy
plate
was
thin
gaunt
but
he
was
smiling
crag
thought
that
he
had
never
seen
such
a
wonderful
smile
nagel
lips
crinkled
into
speech
i
was
beginning
to
wonder
when
you
make
it
even
his
voice
was
different
crag
thought
the
nasal
twang
was
gone
it
was
soft
mellow
deep
with
concern
he
thought
it
was
the
most
wonderful
sound
he
had
ever
heard
thanks
gordon
he
said
simply
he
spoke
the
words
thinking
it
was
the
first
time
he
ever
addressed
the
other
by
his
first
name
how
you
ever
locate
me
started
early
nagel
said
i
was
pretty
sure
you
push
yourself
past
the
point
of
no
return
you
seemed
pretty
set
on
getting
that
critter
it
a
wonder
you
located
me
he
managed
to
push
himself
to
a
sitting
position
prochaska
did
think
i
could
but
i
did
matter
of
fact
i
was
pretty
close
to
you
when
you
broke
from
the
rocks
heading
for
red
dog
red
dog
crag
twisted
his
head
and
looked
toward
the
rocket
he
lying
at
the
base
of
the
rocket
nagel
said
in
answer
to
his
unspoken
question
your
last
volley
sprayed
him
skipper
prochaska
voice
broke
impatiently
into
his
earphones
still
alive
crag
answered
yeah
just
prochaska
voice
was
peevish
you
were
lucky
with
that
last
burst
of
fire
thanks
to
my
good
marksmanship
crag
quipped
weakly
i
wish
you
quit
acting
like
a
company
of
marines
and
get
back
here
okay
colonel
prochaska
cursed
and
crag
grinned
happily
it
was
good
to
be
alive
even
in
crater
arzachel
nagel
helped
him
to
his
feet
and
crag
stood
for
a
moment
feeling
the
strength
surge
back
into
his
body
he
breathed
deeply
luxuriating
in
the
plentiful
oxygen
fresh
oxygen
fresh
as
a
maiden
kiss
he
thought
oxygen
was
gold
more
than
gold
it
was
life
ready
now
ready
as
i
ever
will
be
crag
answered
lead
on
gordon
they
had
almost
reached
bandit
when
crag
broke
the
silence
why
did
you
come
to
the
moon
gordon
nagel
slowed
his
steps
then
stopped
and
turned
why
did
you
come
commander
because
because
crag
floundered
because
someone
had
to
come
he
blurted
because
i
was
supposed
to
be
good
in
my
field
his
eyes
met
nagel
the
oxygen
man
was
smiling
faintly
i
good
in
mine
too
he
said
he
chewed
at
his
bottom
lip
for
a
moment
i
could
give
the
same
reasons
as
you
he
said
finally
truthfully
though
there
more
to
it
he
looked
at
crag
defiantly
i
was
a
misfit
on
earth
commander
a
square
peg
in
a
round
hole
i
had
dreams
dreams
but
they
were
not
the
dreams
of
earth
they
were
dreams
of
places
in
which
there
were
no
people
he
gave
an
odd
of
course
i
did
tell
the
psych
doctors
that
there
plenty
i
did
tell
myself
crag
said
commander
you
might
not
understand
this
but
i
like
the
moon
he
looked
away
staring
into
the
bleakness
of
arzachel
crag
eyes
followed
his
the
plain
beyond
was
an
bowl
broken
by
weird
ledges
spires
grotesque
rocks
in
the
distance
backbone
ridge
crawled
along
the
floor
of
the
basin
forming
its
fantastic
labyrinths
yet
yet
there
was
something
fascinating
almost
beautiful
about
the
crater
it
was
the
kind
of
a
place
a
man
might
cross
the
gulfs
of
space
to
see
nagel
had
crossed
those
gulfs
yes
he
could
understand
i
never
return
to
earth
he
said
almost
dreamily
nonsense
not
nonsense
commander
but
i
not
unhappy
at
the
prospect
do
you
remember
the
lines
the
wide
and
starry
sky
oh
dig
the
grave
and
let
me
lie
well
that
the
way
i
feel
about
the
moon
you
be
happy
enough
to
get
back
to
earth
crag
predicted
i
wo
get
back
commander
do
want
to
get
back
he
turned
broodingly
toward
bandit
maybe
we
better
move
on
crag
said
gently
i
crave
to
get
out
of
this
suit
chapter
martin
larkwell
was
a
good
boy
the
superintendent
said
reminiscently
and
of
course
we
highly
pleased
he
made
his
mark
in
the
world
he
looked
at
the
agent
and
beamed
or
should
i
say
the
moon
the
agent
smiled
dutifully
young
martin
was
particularly
good
with
his
hands
not
that
he
smart
he
added
hurriedly
he
was
very
bright
in
fact
but
he
was
fortunate
in
that
he
coupled
it
with
an
almost
uncanny
knack
of
using
his
hands
the
superintendent
rambled
at
length
the
agent
listened
thinking
it
was
the
same
old
story
the
men
in
the
moon
were
all
great
men
they
had
been
fine
upstanding
boys
all
bright
with
spotless
records
well
of
course
that
was
to
be
expected
in
view
of
the
rigorous
weeding
out
program
which
had
resulted
in
their
selections
only
one
of
them
was
a
traitor
which
one
the
question
drummed
against
his
mind
martin
was
just
a
study
drudge
the
superintendent
was
saying
he
was
a
fine
athlete
the
star
forward
of
the
maple
hill
orphanage
basketball
team
for
three
years
he
added
proudly
he
leaned
forward
and
lowered
his
voice
as
if
taking
the
agent
into
his
confidence
we
conducting
a
drive
to
build
the
orphanage
a
new
gym
maybe
you
can
guess
the
name
we
selected
for
it
the
martin
larkwell
gymnasium
the
agent
said
drily
right
the
superintendent
beamed
that
how
much
we
think
of
martin
larkwell
as
it
turned
out
the
superintendent
was
the
only
one
who
remembered
martin
larkwell
with
fondness
a
druggist
a
grocer
a
gas
station
operator
and
a
little
gray
lady
who
ran
a
pet
shop
remembered
the
orphan
boy
with
surprising
affection
they
and
many
others
that
the
way
the
chips
fall
the
agent
thought
philosophically
let
a
man
become
famous
and
the
whole
world
remembers
him
well
his
job
was
to
separate
the
wheat
from
the
chaff
in
the
days
to
follow
he
painstakingly
traced
martin
larkwell
trail
from
the
maple
hill
orphanage
to
new
york
to
various
construction
jobs
along
the
east
coast
and
finally
through
other
agents
to
a
stint
in
argentina
as
construction
boss
for
an
american
equipment
firm
later
the
trail
led
back
to
america
and
finally
to
construction
foreman
on
project
step
one
his
selection
as
a
member
of
the
aztec
crew
stemmed
from
his
excellent
work
and
construction
ability
displayed
during
building
of
the
drones
all
in
all
the
agent
thought
the
record
was
clear
and
shiny
bright
martin
larkwell
gordon
nagel
max
prochaska
adam
crag
four
eager
american
boys
each
outstanding
in
his
field
there
was
only
one
hitch
who
was
the
traitor
crag
filled
gotch
in
on
the
latest
developments
in
crater
arzachel
the
colonel
listened
without
interruption
until
he
was
through
then
retaliated
with
a
barrage
of
questions
what
was
the
extent
of
the
radioactive
field
what
were
the
dimensions
of
red
dog
had
any
progress
been
made
toward
salvaging
the
cargo
of
drone
baker
how
was
the
airlock
in
the
rill
progressing
would
he
please
describe
the
rocket
launcher
the
enemy
had
used
to
destroy
the
aztec
crag
gritted
his
teeth
to
keep
from
exploding
barely
managing
civil
replies
finally
he
could
hold
it
no
longer
listen
he
grated
this
is
a
crew
not
a
damn
army
certainly
gotch
interrupted
i
appreciate
your
difficulties
i
was
just
in
a
manner
of
speaking
outlining
what
has
to
be
done
as
if
i
did
know
the
colonel
pressed
for
his
future
plans
crag
told
him
what
he
thought
in
no
uncertain
terms
when
he
finished
he
thought
he
heard
a
soft
chuckle
over
the
earphones
damn
gotch
he
thought
the
man
is
a
sadist
the
colonel
gave
him
another
morsel
of
information
a
tidbit
that
mollified
him
pickering
field
gotch
informed
him
was
now
the
official
name
of
the
landing
site
in
crater
arzachel
furthermore
the
air
force
was
petitioning
the
joint
chiefs
to
make
it
an
official
part
of
the
air
force
defense
system
a
fact
which
had
been
announced
to
the
world
furthermore
the
united
states
had
petitioned
the
to
recognize
its
sovereignty
over
the
moon
before
cutting
off
he
added
one
last
bit
of
information
switching
to
moon
code
to
give
it
job
near
he
spelled
out
for
the
moment
crag
felt
jubilant
an
space
ship
spelled
complete
victory
over
the
eastern
world
it
also
meant
venus
mars
magical
names
in
his
mind
man
was
on
his
way
to
the
stars
man
the
peripatetic
quester
for
just
an
instant
he
felt
a
pang
of
jealousy
he
be
pinned
to
his
vacuum
while
men
were
conquering
the
planets
or
would
he
but
the
mood
passed
pickering
field
he
realized
would
play
an
important
role
in
the
future
of
space
flight
if
it
were
the
stars
at
least
it
was
the
in
time
it
would
be
a
vast
air
force
base
housing
rockets
instead
of
stratojets
pickering
base
the
the
road
to
the
stars
pretty
soon
the
place
would
be
filled
with
rank
so
high
that
the
bird
colonels
would
be
doing
mess
duty
but
right
now
he
was
pickering
field
the
man
with
the
brass
eyeballs
while
the
others
caught
up
on
their
sleep
crag
and
prochaska
reviewed
their
homework
as
the
chief
had
dubbed
their
planning
sessions
the
area
in
which
bandit
rested
was
too
far
from
the
nearest
rill
to
use
as
a
base
of
operation
and
it
was
also
vulnerable
to
meteorite
damage
bandit
had
to
be
abandoned
and
soon
red
dog
would
be
their
next
home
there
was
also
the
problem
of
salvaging
the
contents
of
drone
baker
and
removing
the
contents
of
drone
charlie
last
there
was
the
problem
of
building
the
airlock
in
one
of
the
rills
when
they
had
laid
out
the
problems
they
exchanged
quizzical
glances
the
chief
smiled
weakly
seems
like
a
pretty
big
order
a
very
big
order
crag
amended
the
first
move
is
to
secure
red
dog
they
talked
about
it
until
crag
found
his
eyelids
growing
heavy
prochaska
although
tired
volunteered
to
take
the
watch
crag
nodded
gratefully
a
little
sleep
was
something
he
could
use
red
dog
was
squat
ebony
distinguishable
from
the
lithic
structures
dotting
this
section
of
crater
arzachel
only
by
its
symmetry
the
grotesque
rock
ledges
pinnacles
and
twisted
formations
of
the
plain
clearly
were
the
handiwork
of
a
nature
in
the
throes
of
birth
when
volcanoes
burst
and
the
floor
of
the
crater
was
an
uneasy
sea
of
magmatic
rock
red
dog
was
just
as
clearly
the
creation
of
some
artificer
a
creature
born
of
the
intelligence
and
patience
of
man
structured
to
cross
the
planetary
voids
yet
it
seemed
a
part
of
the
plain
as
ancient
as
the
brooding
dolomites
and
diorites
which
made
the
floor
of
arzachel
a
lithic
wonderland
the
tail
of
red
dog
was
buried
in
the
ash
of
the
plain
its
body
reached
upward
canted
slightly
from
the
vertical
as
if
it
were
ready
to
spring
again
to
the
stars
the
rocket
launcher
had
been
removed
now
it
stood
on
the
plain
off
to
one
side
of
the
rocket
small
and
portable
like
some
deadly
insect
the
launcher
bothered
crag
he
wanted
to
destroy
it
or
the
single
missile
that
remained
but
was
deterred
by
its
possible
use
if
the
enemy
should
land
another
manned
ship
in
the
end
he
left
it
where
it
was
one
of
the
numerous
rills
which
crisscrossed
the
floor
of
the
crater
cut
near
the
base
of
the
rocket
at
a
distance
of
about
ten
yards
it
was
a
shallow
rill
about
twelve
feet
wide
and
ten
feet
deep
with
a
bottom
of
soft
ash
adam
crag
studied
the
rocket
and
rill
in
turn
a
plan
gradually
forming
in
his
mind
the
rocket
could
be
toppled
its
engines
removed
and
an
airlock
installed
in
the
tail
section
as
had
been
done
with
the
aztec
it
could
be
lowered
into
the
rill
and
its
body
all
except
the
airlock
covered
with
ash
materials
salvaged
from
the
drones
could
be
used
to
construct
extensions
running
along
the
floor
of
the
rill
and
these
in
turn
covered
with
ash
this
then
would
be
the
first
moonlock
a
place
where
man
could
live
safe
from
the
constant
danger
of
destruction
by
chance
meteorites
he
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
sun
it
was
an
unbearable
circle
of
white
light
hanging
in
the
sky
just
above
the
horizon
giant
black
shadows
crept
out
from
the
towering
walls
of
the
crater
within
another
hours
they
would
engulf
the
rocket
during
the
lunar
night
two
weeks
long
the
crater
floor
would
be
gripped
in
the
cold
of
absolute
space
the
rocket
would
lie
in
a
stygian
night
broken
only
by
the
brilliance
of
the
stars
and
the
reflected
light
of
an
earth
which
would
seem
to
fill
the
sky
but
they
could
wait
for
the
advent
of
a
new
day
they
would
have
to
get
started
immediately
larkwell
opposed
the
idea
of
working
through
the
long
lunar
night
he
argued
that
the
suits
would
not
offer
sufficient
protection
against
the
cold
they
needed
light
to
work
and
that
the
slow
progress
they
would
make
would
warrant
the
risks
and
discomfort
they
would
have
to
undergo
nagel
unexpectedly
sided
with
crag
he
cited
the
waste
of
oxygen
which
resulted
by
having
to
decompress
bandit
every
time
someone
left
or
entered
the
ship
we
need
an
airlock
and
soon
he
said
crag
listened
and
weighed
the
arguments
larkwell
was
right
the
space
suits
were
made
to
withstand
prolonged
exposure
during
the
bitter
hours
of
the
lunar
night
but
nagel
was
right
too
i
doubt
if
we
could
live
cooped
up
in
bandit
for
two
weeks
without
murdering
one
another
prochaska
observed
quietly
i
vote
we
go
ahead
sure
you
sit
on
your
fanny
and
monitor
the
radio
larkwell
growled
i
the
guy
who
has
to
carry
the
load
prochaska
reddened
and
started
to
answer
when
crag
cut
in
cut
the
damned
bickering
he
snapped
max
handles
the
communication
because
that
his
job
he
looked
sharply
at
larkwell
the
construction
boss
grunted
but
did
reply
night
and
bitter
cold
came
to
crater
arzachel
with
a
staggering
blow
instantly
the
plain
became
a
black
pit
lighted
only
by
the
stars
and
the
enormous
crescent
of
the
earth
an
airless
pit
in
which
the
temperature
plunged
until
metal
became
as
brittle
as
glass
and
the
materials
of
the
space
suits
stiffened
until
crag
feared
they
would
crack
larkwell
warned
against
continuing
their
work
one
misstep
in
lowering
red
dog
and
it
shatter
like
an
egg
crag
realized
he
was
right
lowering
the
rocket
in
the
bitter
cold
and
blackness
would
be
a
superhuman
job
loss
of
the
rocket
would
be
disastrous
against
this
was
the
necessity
of
obtaining
shelter
from
the
meteor
falls
his
determination
was
fortified
by
the
discovery
that
a
stray
meteorite
had
smashed
the
nose
of
drone
charlie
he
decided
to
go
on
the
cold
seeped
through
their
suits
chilled
their
bones
touched
their
arms
and
legs
like
a
thousand
pin
pricks
and
lay
like
needles
in
their
lungs
until
every
movement
was
sheer
agony
yet
their
survival
depended
upon
movement
hence
every
moment
away
from
bandit
was
filled
with
forced
activity
but
even
the
space
cabin
of
bandit
was
more
like
an
outsized
icebox
than
a
place
designed
for
human
habitation
the
insulated
walls
were
ice
to
the
touch
their
breaths
were
frosty
streams
sleep
was
possible
only
because
of
utter
fatigue
at
the
end
of
each
work
shift
the
body
simply
rebelled
against
the
task
of
retaining
consciousness
thus
a
few
hours
of
merciful
respite
against
the
cold
was
obtained
crag
assigned
prochaska
the
task
of
monitoring
the
radio
despite
his
plea
to
share
in
the
more
arduous
work
the
knowledge
that
one
of
his
crew
was
a
saboteur
lay
constantly
in
his
mind
he
had
risked
leaving
prochaska
alone
before
he
could
risk
it
again
but
he
was
willing
to
risk
leaving
any
of
the
others
alone
in
bandit
yet
prochaska
found
the
bomb
larkwell
had
worked
superhumanly
at
the
task
of
rebuilding
the
aztec
nagel
had
saved
his
life
when
he
could
just
as
easily
have
let
him
die
neither
seemed
the
work
of
a
saboteur
yet
the
cold
fact
remained
there
was
a
saboteur
richter
too
preyed
on
his
mind
the
eastern
scientist
was
noncommittal
speaking
only
when
spoken
to
yet
he
performed
his
assigned
duties
without
hesitation
he
had
in
fact
made
himself
so
useful
that
he
almost
seemed
one
of
the
crew
that
crag
told
himself
was
the
danger
the
tendency
was
to
stop
watching
richter
to
trust
him
farther
and
farther
was
he
planning
biding
his
time
preparing
to
strike
how
when
he
wished
he
knew
they
toppled
red
dog
in
the
dark
of
the
moon
larkwell
had
run
two
cables
to
manually
operated
winches
set
about
yards
from
the
rocket
a
second
line
extended
from
each
winch
to
the
ravine
the
ends
of
these
were
weighted
with
rocks
they
served
to
anchor
the
winches
during
the
lowering
of
the
rocket
finally
a
guide
line
ran
from
the
nose
of
the
rocket
to
a
third
winch
richter
and
nagel
manned
the
lowering
winches
while
larkwell
worked
with
the
guide
line
with
only
small
hand
torches
to
aid
them
it
was
approximately
the
same
setup
used
on
the
aztec
they
were
getting
good
at
it
crag
helped
until
the
moment
came
to
lower
the
rocket
then
there
was
little
for
him
to
do
he
contented
himself
with
watching
the
operation
playing
his
torch
over
the
scene
as
he
felt
it
was
needed
it
was
an
eery
feeling
the
rocket
was
a
black
monster
bathed
in
the
puny
yellow
rays
of
their
hand
torches
the
pale
light
gave
the
illusion
of
movement
until
the
rocket
the
rocks
and
the
very
floor
of
the
crater
seemed
to
writhe
and
squirm
playing
tricks
on
the
eyes
it
was
he
knew
a
dangerous
moment
one
ripe
for
a
saboteur
to
strike
or
ripe
for
richter
it
was
dark
not
an
ebony
dark
but
one
rather
with
the
odd
color
of
milky
velvet
the
earth
was
almost
full
a
gigantic
globe
whose
reflected
light
washed
out
the
brilliance
of
the
stars
and
gave
a
milky
sheen
to
crater
arzachel
it
was
a
light
in
which
the
eye
detected
form
as
if
it
were
looking
through
a
murky
sea
it
detected
form
but
missed
detail
only
the
gross
structures
of
the
plain
were
visible
the
blackness
of
the
rocket
reaching
upward
into
the
night
fantastic
twisted
rocks
which
blotted
out
segments
of
the
stars
the
black
blobs
of
men
moving
in
heavy
space
suits
dark
shadows
against
the
still
darker
night
the
eery
almost
futile
beams
of
the
hand
torches
seemed
worse
than
useless
all
set
larkwell
voice
was
grim
let
her
come
crag
fastened
his
eyes
on
the
nose
of
red
dog
a
tapered
indistinct
silhouette
start
letting
out
line
at
the
count
of
three
there
was
a
pause
before
larkwell
began
the
countdown
one
two
three
the
nose
moved
swinging
slowly
across
the
sky
then
began
falling
slack
off
the
lines
jerked
snapped
taut
and
the
nose
hung
suspended
in
space
then
began
swinging
to
one
side
take
up
on
your
line
richter
the
sideward
movement
stopped
leaving
the
rocket
canted
at
an
angle
of
about
degrees
okay
the
nose
moved
down
again
slower
this
time
crag
began
to
breathe
easier
suddenly
the
nose
skidded
to
the
rear
falling
then
the
rocket
was
a
motionless
blob
on
the
plain
that
did
it
larkwell
voice
was
ominous
yet
tinged
with
disgust
what
happened
crag
found
himself
shouting
into
the
lip
mike
the
tail
slipped
that
what
we
get
for
trying
to
lower
it
under
these
conditions
larkwell
snarled
the
damn
thing
probably
smashed
crag
did
answer
he
moved
slowly
toward
the
rocket
playing
his
torch
over
its
hull
in
an
attempt
to
discern
its
details
he
was
conscious
that
the
others
had
come
up
and
were
doing
the
same
thing
but
even
when
he
stood
next
to
it
red
dog
was
no
more
than
a
black
shadow
feel
it
larkwell
barked
that
the
only
way
to
tell
the
torches
are
useless
they
followed
his
advice
crag
walked
alongside
the
rocket
moving
his
hand
over
the
smooth
surface
he
had
reached
the
tail
and
started
back
on
the
opposite
side
when
larkwell
voice
rang
in
his
ears
smashed
where
the
under
side
where
she
hit
the
deck
looks
like
she
came
down
on
a
rock
crag
hurried
back
around
the
rocket
nearly
stumbling
over
legs
the
construction
boss
was
lying
on
his
stomach
under
here
crag
dropped
to
his
knees
then
to
his
stomach
and
moved
alongside
larkwell
playing
his
beam
over
the
hull
he
saw
the
break
immediately
a
ragged
gaping
hole
where
the
metal
had
shattered
against
a
small
rock
outcropping
too
big
for
a
weld
larkwell
answered
his
unspoken
thought
you
play
hell
getting
that
welded
it
might
be
possible
there
may
be
more
breaks
they
lay
there
for
a
moment
playing
their
beams
along
the
visible
underside
of
red
dog
until
they
were
satisfied
that
in
this
section
at
least
there
was
no
more
damage
what
now
larkwell
asked
when
they
had
crawled
back
from
under
the
rocket
the
plans
have
changed
crag
said
stonily
we
repair
it
fix
it
up
move
in
that
all
there
is
to
it
you
ca
fix
it
by
just
saying
so
larkwell
growled
first
it
got
to
be
fixable
it
looks
like
a
cooked
duck
to
me
we
got
ta
start
back
nagel
said
urgently
oxygen
getting
low
crag
looked
at
his
gauge
nagel
was
right
they
have
to
get
moving
he
was
about
to
give
the
signal
to
return
to
bandit
when
richter
spoke
up
it
can
be
repaired
for
a
moment
there
was
a
startled
silence
how
the
inside
of
the
cabin
is
lined
with
foam
rubber
the
same
as
in
bandit
a
type
designed
for
protection
against
meteorite
damage
so
larkwell
asked
belligerently
richter
explained
it
not
porous
if
the
break
were
covered
with
metal
and
lined
with
the
foam
it
would
do
a
pretty
good
job
of
sealing
the
cabin
you
ca
patch
a
leak
that
big
with
rubber
and
expect
it
to
hold
larkwell
argued
hell
the
pressure
would
blow
right
through
not
if
you
lined
the
break
with
metal
first
richter
persisted
the
suggestion
startled
crag
coming
as
it
did
from
a
man
whom
he
regarded
as
an
enemy
for
a
moment
he
wondered
if
the
german
instinct
for
survival
were
greater
than
his
patriotism
but
the
plan
sounded
plausible
he
asked
larkwell
what
do
you
think
could
be
he
replied
noncommittally
he
did
seem
pleased
that
richter
was
intruding
in
a
sphere
which
he
considered
his
own
crag
gave
a
last
look
at
the
silhouette
of
the
fallen
giant
on
the
plain
and
announced
we
try
it
if
it
does
work
we
in
the
soup
larkwell
insisted
suppose
there
are
more
breaks
we
patch
those
too
crag
snapped
he
felt
an
unreasonable
surge
of
anger
toward
the
construction
boss
he
sucked
his
lip
vexedly
then
turned
his
torch
on
his
oxygen
meter
we
better
get
moving
chapter
colonel
michael
gotch
looked
at
the
agent
across
the
narrow
expanse
of
his
battered
desk
then
his
eyes
fell
again
to
the
dockets
four
dockets
four
small
sheaves
of
paper
each
the
capsuled
story
of
a
life
the
names
on
the
dockets
were
literally
burned
into
his
mind
adam
philip
crag
martin
leroy
larkwell
gordon
wells
nagel
max
edward
prochaska
four
names
four
men
four
separate
egos
who
by
the
magic
of
man
had
been
transported
to
a
bleak
haven
on
another
world
four
men
whose
task
was
to
survive
an
alien
hell
until
the
officially
recognized
the
united
states
claim
to
sovereignty
over
the
stark
lands
of
the
moon
but
one
of
the
men
was
a
saboteur
an
agent
whose
task
was
to
destroy
the
western
claim
to
ownership
by
destroying
its
occupancy
of
the
moon
that
would
leave
the
east
free
to
claim
at
least
equal
sovereignty
on
the
basis
that
it
too
had
established
occupancy
in
a
lunar
base
the
agent
broke
into
his
thoughts
i
almost
stake
my
professional
reputation
he
your
man
he
reached
over
and
tapped
one
of
the
dockets
significantly
the
word
the
single
word
that
what
you
used
to
tell
me
to
watch
for
well
the
single
word
is
there
the
word
that
spells
traitor
gone
over
his
record
a
dozen
times
before
i
stumbled
on
it
he
ceased
speaking
and
watched
the
colonel
you
may
be
right
gotch
said
at
last
that
the
kind
of
slip
pounce
on
myself
he
hesitated
go
on
the
agent
said
as
if
reading
his
thoughts
there
one
thing
i
did
tell
you
because
i
did
want
to
prejudice
your
thinking
the
psychiatrists
agree
with
you
the
psychiatrists
the
agent
brow
furrowed
in
a
question
they
restudied
the
records
exhaustively
ever
since
we
first
knew
there
was
a
saboteur
in
the
crew
they
weighed
their
egos
dissected
their
personalities
analyzed
their
capabilities
literally
taken
them
apart
and
put
them
together
again
i
got
their
report
just
this
morning
gotch
looked
speculatively
at
the
agent
your
suspect
is
also
their
choice
only
there
is
no
traitor
no
traitor
the
agent
started
visibly
i
do
get
you
no
traitor
gotch
echoed
this
is
a
tougher
nut
than
that
the
personality
profile
of
one
man
shows
a
distinct
break
he
looked
expectantly
at
the
agent
a
plant
the
agent
muttered
the
words
thoughtfully
a
ringer
a
spy
who
has
adopted
the
life
role
of
another
that
indicates
careful
planning
long
preparation
he
muttered
the
words
aloud
talking
to
himself
he
would
have
had
to
cover
every
contingency
friends
relatives
acquaintances
skills
hobbies
then
at
an
exact
time
and
place
our
man
was
whisked
away
and
he
merely
stepped
in
he
shook
his
head
that
the
kind
of
nut
that
really
tough
to
crack
crack
it
gotch
said
the
agent
got
to
his
feet
i
dig
him
out
he
promised
savagely
the
drive
to
rehabilitate
red
dog
became
a
frenzy
in
crag
mind
he
drove
his
crew
mercilessly
beset
by
a
terrible
sense
of
urgency
nor
did
he
spare
himself
they
rigged
lines
in
the
dark
of
the
moon
and
rotated
the
rocket
on
its
long
axis
until
the
break
in
the
hull
was
accessible
crag
viewed
it
with
dismay
it
was
far
longer
than
he
had
feared
a
splintered
jagged
hole
whose
raw
torn
edges
were
bent
into
the
belly
of
the
ship
they
finally
solved
the
problem
by
using
the
hatch
door
of
drone
charlie
as
a
seal
lining
it
with
sheets
of
foam
from
bandit
whose
interior
temperature
immediately
plummeted
to
a
point
where
it
was
scarcely
livable
prochaska
bore
the
brunt
of
this
new
discomfort
confined
as
he
was
to
the
cabin
and
with
little
opportunity
for
physical
activity
he
nearly
froze
until
he
took
to
living
in
his
space
suit
crag
began
planning
the
provisioning
of
red
dog
even
before
he
knew
it
could
be
repaired
during
each
trip
from
bandit
he
burdened
the
men
with
supplies
between
times
he
managed
to
remove
the
spare
oxygen
cylinders
carried
in
drone
charlie
there
was
still
a
scant
supply
in
drone
baker
but
he
decided
to
leave
those
until
later
the
problems
confronting
him
gnawed
at
his
mind
until
each
small
difficulty
assumed
giant
proportions
each
time
he
managed
to
fit
the
work
into
a
proper
mental
perspective
a
new
problem
or
disaster
cropped
up
he
grew
nervous
and
irritable
in
his
frantic
haste
to
complete
the
work
on
red
dog
he
found
himself
begrudging
the
crew
the
few
hours
they
took
off
each
day
for
sleep
it
he
finally
told
himself
adam
yet
despite
his
almost
hourly
resolves
to
slow
down
he
found
himself
pushing
at
an
ever
faster
pace
complete
red
dog
complete
red
dog
became
a
refrain
in
his
mind
larkwell
grew
sullen
and
surly
snapping
at
richter
at
the
slightest
provocation
nagel
became
completely
indifferent
and
in
the
process
completely
ineffectual
crag
had
long
realized
that
the
oxygen
man
had
reached
his
physical
limits
now
he
knew
nagel
had
passed
them
maybe
he
was
right
maybe
he
would
leave
the
moon
when
the
break
in
red
dog
was
repaired
crag
waited
tense
and
jittery
while
nagel
entered
the
rocket
and
pressurized
it
it
work
he
told
himself
it
got
to
work
the
short
period
nagel
remained
in
the
rocket
seemed
to
extend
into
hours
before
he
opened
the
hatch
one
or
two
small
leaks
he
reported
wearily
he
looked
disconsolately
at
crag
maybe
we
can
locate
them
with
a
little
time
good
crag
nodded
relieved
another
crisis
past
he
ordered
larkwell
to
start
pulling
the
engines
if
things
went
right
the
work
did
progress
nearly
as
fast
as
he
had
hoped
for
one
thing
the
engines
were
designed
for
removal
they
were
welded
fast
against
cross
beams
spread
between
the
hull
consequently
the
metal
sides
of
the
ship
were
punctured
numerous
times
before
the
job
was
completed
each
hole
required
another
weld
another
patch
and
increased
the
danger
of
later
disaster
crag
grew
steadily
moodier
larkwell
seemed
to
take
a
vicious
satisfaction
out
of
each
successive
disaster
he
had
adopted
an
attitude
that
grated
crag
nerves
raw
surprisingly
enough
richter
proved
to
be
a
steadying
influence
at
least
to
crag
he
worked
quietly
efficiently
seeming
to
anticipate
problems
and
find
solutions
before
even
crag
recognized
them
despite
the
fact
that
he
found
himself
depending
on
the
german
more
and
more
he
was
determined
never
to
relax
his
surveillance
over
the
man
richter
was
an
enemy
a
man
to
be
watched
larkwell
and
nagel
were
lackadaisically
beginning
work
on
the
airlock
when
prochaska
came
on
the
interphones
with
an
emergency
call
gotch
calling
he
told
crag
he
hot
to
get
you
on
the
line
crag
hesitated
tell
him
to
go
to
hell
he
said
finally
i
call
him
on
the
regular
hour
he
said
you
say
that
prochaska
informed
him
amiably
but
he
wants
you
now
another
emergency
another
is
a
damn
crag
thought
savagely
okay
i
on
my
way
he
said
wearily
anything
to
keep
him
off
my
back
can
i
tell
him
that
tell
him
anything
you
want
crag
snapped
he
debated
taking
the
crew
with
him
but
finally
decided
against
it
they
could
afford
the
time
reluctantly
he
put
the
work
party
in
larkwell
charge
and
started
back
across
the
bowl
of
the
crater
each
step
a
deliberate
weighted
effort
so
much
to
do
so
little
time
he
trudged
through
the
night
cursing
the
fate
that
had
made
him
gotch
pawn
gotch
was
crisp
and
to
the
point
another
rocket
was
launched
from
east
of
the
caspian
this
morning
he
told
him
jesus
we
need
a
company
of
marines
not
this
time
adam
oh
crag
muttered
the
word
that
right
a
warhead
gotch
confirmed
crag
kicked
the
information
around
in
his
mind
for
a
moment
what
do
the
computers
say
too
early
to
say
for
sure
but
it
looks
like
it
on
the
right
track
unless
it
a
direct
hit
it
no
go
we
got
ten
thousand
foot
walls
rimming
this
the
colonel
was
silent
for
a
moment
it
not
quite
that
pat
he
said
finally
why
not
because
of
the
low
gravity
thousands
of
tons
of
rock
will
be
lifted
some
will
escape
but
the
majority
will
fall
back
like
rain
smash
down
over
a
tremendously
large
area
adam
at
least
that
what
the
scientists
tell
us
okay
in
four
days
we
be
underground
he
said
with
exaggerated
cheerfulness
as
safe
as
bunnies
in
their
burrows
can
you
make
it
that
fast
we
have
to
that
means
well
have
to
use
prochaska
that
keep
you
off
the
lines
except
for
the
regular
broadcast
hour
he
said
with
satisfaction
gotch
snorted
go
to
hell
been
on
the
verge
of
it
ever
since
we
left
earth
one
other
thing
gotch
said
baby
almost
ready
to
try
its
wings
the
atomic
spaceship
crag
suppressed
his
excitement
with
difficulty
he
held
down
his
voice
about
time
he
said
laconically
do
give
me
that
blasé
crap
the
colonel
said
cheerfully
i
know
exactly
how
you
feel
he
informed
him
that
the
enemy
was
proclaiming
to
the
world
they
had
established
a
colony
on
the
moon
and
had
formally
requested
the
united
nations
to
recognize
their
sovereignty
over
the
lunar
world
how
that
for
a
stack
of
hogwash
he
ended
pretty
good
crag
agreed
what
are
we
claiming
the
same
thing
only
we
happen
to
be
telling
the
truth
how
will
the
know
that
we
cross
that
bridge
when
we
get
to
it
adam
just
keep
alive
and
let
us
worry
about
the
i
not
going
to
commit
suicide
if
that
what
you
thinking
you
can
if
you
do
keep
on
your
toes
meaning
the
saboteur
his
voice
fell
off
for
a
moment
i
been
wanting
to
talk
with
you
about
that
adam
we
have
a
lead
i
ca
name
the
man
yet
because
it
pretty
thin
evidence
just
keep
on
your
toes
i
am
i
a
grown
boy
remember
more
than
usual
gotch
persisted
the
enemy
is
making
an
drive
to
destroy
pickering
base
you
can
be
sure
the
saboteur
will
do
his
share
the
stage
is
set
adam
for
what
for
murder
not
this
lad
do
be
too
cocky
remember
the
blue
door
episode
you
the
key
man
and
that
makes
you
the
key
target
without
you
the
rest
would
be
a
cinch
i
be
careful
crag
promised
doubly
careful
gotch
cautioned
do
be
a
sitting
duck
i
think
maybe
we
have
a
report
for
you
before
long
he
added
enigmatically
if
the
warhead
does
get
us
crag
reminded
him
and
thanks
for
all
the
good
news
he
laughed
mirthlessly
they
exchanged
a
few
more
words
and
cut
off
he
turned
to
prochaska
weighing
his
gaunt
face
you
get
your
wish
max
climb
into
your
spaceman
duds
and
i
take
you
for
a
stroll
as
of
now
you
a
working
man
yippee
prochaska
clowned
i
joined
the
international
ranks
of
workers
crag
answering
grin
was
bleak
you
be
sorry
he
said
quietly
chapter
the
earth
was
no
longer
a
round
full
ball
it
was
a
gibbous
mass
of
light
humpbacked
a
twisted
giant
in
the
sky
whose
reflected
radiance
swept
the
lunar
night
and
dimmed
even
the
brightest
of
the
stars
its
beacon
swept
out
through
space
falling
in
crater
arzachel
with
a
soft
creamy
sheen
outlining
the
structures
of
the
plain
with
its
dim
glow
larkwell
and
nagel
had
finished
the
airlock
the
rocket
had
been
tested
and
despite
a
few
minute
leaks
they
had
failed
to
locate
the
space
cabin
was
sufficiently
airtight
to
serve
their
purpose
but
the
rocket
had
still
to
be
lowered
into
the
rill
larkwell
favored
waiting
for
the
coming
sun
it
only
a
few
more
days
he
told
crag
we
ca
wait
we
smashed
this
baby
once
by
not
waiting
well
have
to
risk
it
crag
said
firmly
why
we
not
that
short
of
oxygen
crag
debated
sooner
or
later
the
others
would
have
to
be
told
about
the
new
threat
from
the
sides
that
morning
gotch
had
given
him
ominous
news
the
computers
indicated
it
was
going
to
be
close
very
close
he
looked
around
they
were
watching
him
waiting
for
him
to
give
answer
to
larkwell
question
he
said
softly
okay
i
tell
you
why
there
a
rocket
homing
in
with
the
name
arzachel
on
its
nose
more
visitors
the
plaintive
query
came
from
nagel
crag
shook
his
head
negatively
we
got
arms
prochaska
broke
in
confidently
he
grinned
elect
you
commander
of
the
first
arzachel
infantry
company
this
rocket
is
manned
no
it
a
warhead
crag
said
grimly
a
nuclear
warhead
if
we
not
underground
when
it
hits
he
left
the
sentence
dangling
and
looked
around
the
masked
faces
were
blank
expressionless
it
was
a
moment
of
silence
of
weighing
before
larkwell
spoke
okay
he
said
we
drop
her
into
the
hole
he
turned
back
and
gazed
at
red
dog
nagel
did
move
he
kept
his
eyes
on
crag
seemingly
rooted
to
the
spot
until
prochaska
touched
his
arm
come
on
gordon
he
said
kindly
we
got
work
to
do
only
then
did
the
oxygen
man
turn
away
crag
had
the
feeling
he
was
in
a
daze
they
worked
four
hours
beyond
the
regular
shift
before
crag
gave
the
signal
to
stop
the
cables
had
been
fastened
to
red
dog
the
winches
set
now
it
was
poised
on
the
brink
of
the
rill
ready
for
lowering
into
the
black
depths
crag
was
impatient
to
push
ahead
but
he
knew
the
men
were
too
tired
even
the
larkwell
was
faltering
it
would
be
too
risky
yet
he
only
reluctantly
gave
the
signal
to
start
back
toward
bandit
they
trudged
across
the
plain
five
black
blobs
five
shadows
plodding
through
a
midnight
pit
crag
led
the
way
the
earth
overhead
gleamed
with
a
light
the
stars
against
the
sky
were
washed
to
a
million
glimmering
pinpoints
the
sky
the
crater
the
black
shadows
etched
against
the
blacker
night
bespoke
the
alienage
of
the
universe
arzachel
was
the
forgotten
world
more
a
world
that
never
was
it
was
solid
matter
created
of
nothingness
floating
in
nothingness
a
minute
speck
adrift
in
the
terrible
emptiness
of
the
cosmos
he
shivered
it
was
an
eery
feeling
he
reached
bandit
and
waited
for
the
others
to
arrive
prochaska
fresher
than
the
others
was
first
on
the
scene
he
threw
a
mock
salute
to
crag
and
started
up
the
ladder
larkwell
and
richter
arrived
moments
later
he
watched
them
approach
they
seemed
stooped
like
old
men
he
thought
but
they
gave
him
a
short
nod
before
climbing
to
the
space
cabin
he
was
beginning
to
worry
before
nagel
finally
appeared
the
oxygen
man
was
staggering
with
weariness
barely
able
to
stand
erect
crag
stepped
aside
after
you
gordon
thanks
skipper
crag
anxiously
watched
while
gordon
pulled
his
way
up
the
rope
ladder
he
paused
halfway
and
rested
his
head
on
his
arms
after
a
moment
he
resumed
the
climb
crag
waited
until
he
reached
the
cabin
before
following
could
nagel
hold
out
could
a
man
die
of
sheer
exhaustion
the
worry
nibbled
at
his
mind
maybe
he
should
give
him
a
rest
let
him
monitor
the
communicator
or
just
sleep
as
it
was
his
contribution
to
their
work
was
nil
he
did
little
more
than
go
through
the
motions
crag
debated
the
problem
while
they
pressurized
the
cabin
and
removed
their
suits
what
would
gotch
do
gotch
would
drive
him
till
he
died
that
what
gotch
would
expect
him
to
do
no
he
could
be
soft
even
nagel
slight
contribution
might
make
the
difference
between
success
or
failure
life
or
death
he
would
have
to
ride
it
out
crag
set
his
lips
grimly
he
had
felt
kinder
toward
the
oxygen
man
since
that
brief
period
when
nagel
had
let
him
peer
into
his
mind
now
now
he
felt
like
his
executioner
just
when
he
was
beginning
to
understand
the
vistas
of
nagel
being
but
understanding
and
sympathizing
with
nagel
made
his
task
all
the
more
difficult
impatiently
he
pushed
the
problem
from
his
mind
there
were
other
bigger
things
he
had
to
consider
like
the
warhead
larkwell
was
getting
out
their
rations
when
prochaska
slumped
wordlessly
to
the
floor
crag
leaped
to
his
side
the
chief
face
was
white
drawn
twisted
in
a
curious
way
crag
felt
bewildered
odd
but
his
brain
refused
to
function
he
was
struggling
to
make
himself
think
when
he
saw
nagel
leap
for
his
pressure
suit
understanding
came
he
shouted
to
the
others
and
grabbed
for
his
own
garments
he
fought
a
wave
of
dizziness
while
he
struggled
to
get
them
on
his
fingers
were
heavy
awkward
he
fumbled
with
the
face
plate
for
long
precious
seconds
before
he
managed
to
pull
it
shut
and
snap
on
the
oxygen
nagel
had
finished
and
was
trying
to
dress
prochaska
crag
sprang
to
help
him
together
they
managed
to
get
him
into
his
suit
and
turn
on
his
oxygen
only
then
did
he
speak
how
did
we
lose
oxygen
gordon
i
do
know
he
sounded
frightened
a
slow
leak
he
got
out
his
test
equipment
and
fumbled
with
it
the
others
watched
waiting
nervously
until
he
finally
spoke
a
very
slow
leak
must
have
been
a
meteorite
strike
can
you
locate
it
nagel
shrugged
in
his
suit
it
take
time
and
cost
some
oxygen
crag
looked
at
him
and
decided
he
was
past
the
point
of
work
past
even
the
point
of
caring
we
take
care
of
it
he
said
gently
get
a
little
rest
gordon
thanks
skipper
nagel
slumped
down
in
one
of
the
seats
and
buried
his
head
in
his
arms
before
long
prochaska
began
to
stir
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
blankly
at
crag
for
a
long
moment
before
comprehension
came
to
his
face
oxygen
probably
a
meteorite
strike
but
it
okay
now
prochaska
struggled
to
his
feet
well
i
needed
the
rest
he
joked
feebly
the
leak
put
an
end
to
all
thoughts
of
rations
they
would
have
to
remain
in
their
suits
until
it
was
found
and
repaired
at
suggestion
nagel
and
larkwell
went
to
sleep
more
properly
they
simply
collapsed
in
their
suits
richter
however
insisted
on
helping
search
for
the
break
in
the
hull
crag
did
protest
he
was
in
fact
thankful
it
was
prochaska
who
found
it
a
small
rupture
hardly
larger
than
a
pea
in
one
corner
of
the
cabin
meteorite
he
affirmed
examining
the
hole
we
lucky
it
happened
before
they
patched
the
break
and
repressurized
the
cabin
then
tested
it
pressure
remained
constant
crag
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
and
started
to
shuck
his
suit
richter
followed
his
example
but
prochaska
hesitated
standing
uncertainly
makes
you
leery
he
said
the
chances
of
another
strike
are
fairly
low
crag
encouraged
i
feel
the
same
way
but
we
ca
live
in
these
duds
he
finished
peeling
off
his
garments
and
prochaska
followed
suit
despite
his
fatigue
sleep
did
come
easy
to
crag
he
tossed
restlessly
trying
to
push
the
problems
out
of
his
mind
just
before
he
finally
fell
asleep
thought
of
the
saboteur
popped
into
his
mind
be
a
sitting
duck
he
told
himself
he
was
trying
to
pull
himself
back
to
wakefulness
when
his
body
rebelled
he
slept
they
prepared
to
lower
red
dog
into
the
rill
earth
was
humpbacked
in
the
sky
almost
a
crescent
with
a
bright
cone
of
zodiacal
light
in
the
east
the
light
was
a
herald
of
the
coming
sun
a
sun
whose
rays
would
not
reach
the
depths
of
crater
arzachel
for
another
hours
in
the
black
pit
of
the
crater
the
yellow
torches
of
the
work
crew
played
over
the
body
of
the
rocket
making
it
appear
like
some
gargantuan
monster
pulled
from
the
depths
of
the
sea
it
was
poised
on
the
brink
of
the
rill
with
cables
encircling
its
body
running
to
winches
anchored
nearby
the
cables
would
be
let
out
slowly
allowing
the
rocket
to
descend
into
the
depths
of
the
crevice
larkwell
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
rill
manned
a
power
winch
rigged
to
pull
the
rocket
over
the
lip
of
the
crevice
ready
on
winch
one
his
voice
was
a
brittle
bark
edgy
with
strain
nagel
spoke
up
ready
on
winch
one
ready
on

two
ready
on

prochaska
answered
here
we
go
the
line
from
red
dog
to
larkwell
winch
tautened
jerked
then
tautened
once
more
red
dog
seemed
to
quiver
and
began
rolling
slowly
toward
the
brink
of
the
rill
crag
watched
from
a
nearby
spur
of
rock
he
smiled
wryly
lowering
rockets
on
the
moon
was
getting
to
be
an
old
story
the
cables
and
winches
all
seemed
familiar
well
this
would
be
the
last
one
they
have
to
lower
he
hoped
richter
stood
beside
him
silent
the
rocket
hung
on
the
lip
of
the
crevice
for
a
moment
before
starting
over
take
up
slack
the
lines
to
the
anchor
winches
became
taut
and
the
rocket
hung
in
space
okay
larkwell
line
tightened
again
and
the
rocket
jerked
clear
of
the
edge
held
in
space
by
the
anchor
winches
lower
away
slowly
crag
moved
to
the
edge
of
the
rill
conscious
of
richter
at
his
heels
the
man
constant
presence
jarred
him
yet
he
was
there
by
his
orders
he
played
his
torch
over
the
rocket
it
was
moving
into
the
rill
in
a
series
of
jerks
its
tail
struck
the
ashy
floor
in
another
moment
it
rested
at
the
bottom
of
the
crevice
they
would
make
it
a
wave
of
exultation
swept
him
the
biggest
problems
could
be
whipped
if
you
just
got
aboard
and
rode
them
well
he
ridden
this
one
ridden
it
through
a
night
of
stygian
blackness
and
unbelievable
cold
ridden
it
to
victory
despite
damnable
odds
he
felt
jubilant
but
they
would
have
to
hurry
if
they
were
to
get
all
their
supplies
and
gear
moved
from
bandit
before
the
warhead
struck
they
still
had
to
cover
red
dog
burying
it
beneath
a
thick
coat
of
ash
would
that
be
enough
it
was
designed
to
protect
them
from
the
dangers
of
meteorite
dust
but
would
it
withstand
the
rain
of
hell
to
come
when
the
warhead
struck
wearily
he
pushed
the
thought
from
his
mind
when
the
others
had
secured
their
gear
he
gave
the
signal
to
return
to
bandit
they
struck
out
trudging
through
the
blackness
in
single
file
following
a
serpentine
path
between
the
occasional
rills
and
knolls
scattered
between
the
two
ships
crag
swung
his
arms
in
an
effort
to
keep
warm
tiny
needles
of
pain
stabbed
at
his
hands
and
feet
and
the
cold
in
his
lungs
was
an
agony
even
in
the
darkness
the
path
between
the
rockets
had
become
a
familiar
thing
despite
the
discomfort
and
weariness
he
rather
liked
the
long
trek
between
the
rockets
it
gave
him
time
to
think
and
plan
a
time
when
nothing
was
demanded
of
him
except
that
he
follow
a
reasonably
straight
course
there
was
no
warhead
no
east
world
menace
no
gotch
there
was
only
the
blackness
and
the
solitude
of
crater
arzachel
he
even
liked
the
blackness
of
the
lunar
night
despite
its
attendant
cold
the
mantle
of
darkness
hid
the
crater
ugliness
erasing
its
menacing
profile
and
softening
its
features
he
turned
his
eyes
skyward
as
he
walked
the
earth
was
huge
many
times
the
size
of
the
full
moon
as
seen
from
its
mother
planet
yet
it
seemed
fragile
delicate
a
pale
ethereal
wanderer
of
the
heavens
crag
did
not
think
of
himself
as
an
imaginative
man
yet
when
he
beheld
the
earth
something
stirred
deep
within
him
the
earth
became
not
a
thing
of
rock
and
sea
water
and
air
but
a
living
being
he
thought
of
earth
as
at
times
she
was
a
ghost
treading
among
the
stars
a
waif
lost
in
the
immensity
of
the
universe
and
at
times
she
was
a
wanton
woman
walking
in
solitary
splendor
her
head
high
and
proud
the
stars
were
her
lovers
crag
walked
through
the
night
head
up
wondering
if
ever
again
he
would
answer
her
call
he
had
almost
reached
bandit
when
nagel
voice
broke
excitedly
into
his
earphones
something
wrong
with
prochaska
crag
stopped
in
his
tracks
gripped
by
a
sudden
fear
what
he
was
somewhere
ahead
of
me
i
just
caught
up
to
him
what
wrong
with
him
crag
snapped
irritably
damn
would
the
man
stop
beating
around
the
bush
he
collapsed
coming
crag
said
he
hurried
back
through
the
darkness
cursing
himself
for
having
let
the
party
get
strung
out
too
late
commander
it
was
richter
voice
his
suit
deflated
must
have
been
a
meteorite
strike
stay
there
crag
ordered
larkwell
i
backtracking
too
they
were
all
there
when
he
arrived
gathered
around
prochaska
huddled
form
the
yellow
lights
of
their
torches
pinned
his
body
against
the
ashy
plain
larkwell
on
his
knees
was
running
his
hands
over
the
electronic
chief
body
crag
dropped
to
his
side
here
it
is
larkwell
fingers
had
found
the
hole
a
tiny
rip
just
under
the
shoulder
crag
examined
it
conscious
that
something
was
wrong
it
did
look
like
the
kind
of
hole
a
meteorite
would
make
it
looked
he
thought
like
a
small
rip
the
kind
of
a
rip
a
knife
point
might
make
he
stared
up
at
larkwell
the
construction
boss
eyes
met
his
and
he
nodded
his
head
affirmatively
crag
got
to
his
feet
and
faced
the
german
where
were
you
when
this
happened
ahead
of
him
richter
answered
we
were
strung
out
i
think
i
was
next
in
line
behind
you
larkwell
said
softly
you
got
here
before
i
did
that
would
put
you
behind
me
i
was
ahead
of
you
when
we
started
the
german
contemplated
larkwell
calmly
i
did
see
you
pass
me
crag
turned
to
nagel
where
were
you
gordon
at
the
rear
as
usual
his
voice
was
bitter
how
far
was
prochaska
ahead
of
you
i
would
know
he
looked
away
into
the
blackness
then
back
to
crag
would
you
expect
me
to
crag
debated
clearly
he
was
getting
anywhere
with
the
interrogation
he
looked
at
nagel
the
man
seemed
on
the
verge
of
collapse
we
carry
max
back
lend
a
hand
richter
his
voice
turned
cold
i
want
to
examine
that
rip
in
the
light
the
german
nodded
calmly
stay
together
crag
barked
no
stringing
out
larkwell
you
lead
the
way
okay
the
construction
boss
started
toward
bandit
nagel
fell
in
at
his
heels
crag
and
richter
carrying
prochaska
body
between
them
brought
up
at
the
rear
it
took
the
last
of
crag
strength
before
they
managed
to
get
the
body
into
the
space
cabin
the
men
were
silent
while
he
conducted
his
examination
he
removed
the
dead
man
space
suit
then
stripped
the
clothing
from
the
upper
portion
of
his
body
examining
the
flesh
in
the
area
where
the
suit
had
been
punctured
the
skin
was
unmarked
he
studied
the
rip
carefully
it
was
a
clean
slit
no
meteorite
he
said
getting
to
his
feet
his
voice
was
cold
dangerously
low
larkwell
face
was
grim
nagel
wore
a
dazed
almost
uncomprehending
expression
richter
looked
thoughtful
crag
face
was
an
icy
mask
but
his
thoughts
were
chaotic
fear
crept
into
his
mind
this
was
the
danger
gotch
had
warned
him
of
richter
the
saboteur
his
eyes
swung
from
man
to
man
coming
finally
to
rest
on
the
german
while
he
weighed
the
problem
one
part
of
his
mind
told
him
a
warhead
was
scorching
down
from
the
sides
time
was
running
out
he
came
to
a
decision
he
ordered
larkwell
and
richter
to
strip
the
pressure
gear
from
prochaska
body
and
carry
it
down
to
the
plain
well
bury
him
later
after
the
warhead
if
we
here
larkwell
observed
i
have
every
intention
of
being
here
crag
said
evenly
chapter
the
day
of
the
warhead
arrived
the
earth
was
a
thin
crescent
in
the
sky
whose
light
no
longer
paled
the
stars
they
gleamed
hard
and
brittle
against
the
of
space
the
reds
and
yellows
and
brilliant
hot
blues
of
suns
lying
at
unimaginable
distances
in
the
vast
box
of
the
universe
night
still
gripped
crater
arzachel
with
its
intolerable
cold
but
a
zodiacal
light
in
the
sky
whispered
of
a
lunar
dawn
to
come
measured
against
the
incalculable
scale
of
space
distances
the
rocket
had
but
a
relative
inch
to
cross
that
inch
was
almost
crossed
the
rocket
speed
had
dropped
to
a
mere
crawl
before
it
entered
the
moon
gravitational
field
then
it
had
picked
up
again
moving
ever
faster
toward
its
rendezvous
with
destruction
now
it
was
storming
down
into
the
face
of
the
land
they
buried
red
dog
larkwell
had
improvised
a
crude
scraper
made
of
metal
strips
from
the
interior
of
drone
baker
to
aid
in
the
task
he
attached
loops
of
cable
to
pull
it
crag
larkwell
and
richter
wearily
dragged
the
scraper
across
the
plain
heaping
the
ash
into
piles
while
nagel
handled
the
easier
job
of
pushing
them
over
the
edge
of
the
rill
the
unevenness
of
the
plain
and
occasional
rock
outcroppings
made
the
work
exasperatingly
slow
crag
fumed
but
there
was
little
he
could
do
to
rectify
the
situation
it
took
the
better
part
of
eight
hours
before
the
rill
was
filled
level
with
the
plain
with
only
the
extreme
end
of
the
tail
containing
the
airlock
being
left
accessible
wo
do
a
damn
bit
of
good
if
anything
big
comes
down
larkwell
observed
when
they
had
finished
there
not
much
chance
of
a
major
hit
crag
conjectured
it
the
small
stuff
that
worries
me
bandit
would
be
just
as
safe
larkwell
persisted
perhaps
he
turned
away
from
the
construction
boss
richter
was
swinging
his
arms
and
stamping
his
feet
in
an
effort
to
keep
warm
nagel
sat
dejectedly
on
a
rock
head
buried
in
his
arms
crag
felt
a
momentary
pity
for
him
a
pity
tinged
with
resentment
nagel
was
the
weak
link
in
their
armor
a
threat
to
their
safety
for
all
practical
purposes
two
men
he
did
include
richter
were
doing
the
work
of
three
yet
he
thought
he
could
exclude
the
german
the
oxygen
and
supplies
he
consumed
were
less
than
those
they
had
obtained
from
bandit
and
red
dog
and
richter
worked
worked
with
a
calm
relentless
purpose
more
than
made
up
for
nagel
inability
to
shoulder
his
share
maybe
richter
was
a
blessing
in
disguise
he
smiled
grimly
at
the
thought
but
we
all
shot
he
told
himself
all
damned
tired
someone
had
to
be
the
first
to
cave
in
so
why
not
nagel
he
looked
skyward
the
stars
reminded
him
of
glittering
chunks
of
ice
in
some
celestial
freezebox
he
moved
his
arms
vigorously
conscious
of
the
bitter
cold
gnawing
at
his
bones
sharp
needles
stabbing
his
arms
and
legs
he
was
cold
yet
his
body
felt
clammy
he
became
conscious
of
a
dull
ache
at
the
nape
of
his
neck
thought
of
the
warhead
stirred
him
to
action
we
got
ta
fill
this
baby
he
said
speaking
to
no
one
in
particular
oxygen
food
gear
there
not
much
time
left
larkwell
snickered
you
can
say
that
again
crag
said
thinly
well
make
it
he
looked
sympathetically
at
nagel
come
on
gordon
we
got
ta
move
crag
kept
the
men
close
together
in
single
file
with
larkwell
leading
he
was
followed
by
nagel
crag
brought
up
at
the
rear
memory
of
prochaska
fate
burned
in
his
mind
and
he
kept
his
attention
riveted
on
the
men
ahead
of
him
they
trudged
through
the
night
slowly
wearily
following
the
serpentine
path
toward
bandit
he
occasionally
flicked
on
his
torch
splaying
it
over
the
column
checking
the
positions
of
the
men
ahead
of
him
they
rounded
the
end
of
a
rill
the
base
of
a
small
knoll
winding
their
way
toward
bandit
overhead
altair
formed
a
great
triangle
with
deneb
and
vega
antares
gleamed
red
from
the
heart
of
scorpius
off
to
one
side
lay
sagittarius
the
archer
he
thought
that
the
giant
hollow
of
arzachel
must
be
the
loneliest
spot
in
all
the
universe
he
felt
numbed
drained
of
all
motion
commander
the
single
imperative
call
snapped
him
to
attention
come
quick
something
wrong
with
nagel
crag
leaped
ahead
flashing
his
torch
he
saw
richter
form
bent
over
a
recumbent
figure
while
his
mind
registered
the
fact
that
it
was
the
german
voice
he
had
heard
he
leaped
to
his
side
keeping
his
eyes
pinned
on
richter
until
he
saw
the
man
hands
were
empty
he
knelt
by
nagel
his
suit
was
inflated
crag
breathed
easier
he
said
briefly
exhaustion
richter
nodded
an
odd
rumble
sounded
in
crag
earphones
rising
and
falling
it
took
him
a
moment
to
realize
it
was
nagel
snoring
he
rose
in
a
secret
sweat
of
mingled
relief
and
apprehension
and
looked
down
at
the
recumbent
form
thankful
they
were
near
bandit
larkwell
grunted
gets
tougher
all
the
time
it
took
the
three
of
them
to
get
nagel
back
to
the
rocket
crag
pressurized
the
cabin
and
opened
the
sleeping
man
face
plate
he
continued
to
snore
his
lips
vibrating
with
each
exhalation
while
he
slept
they
gulped
down
food
and
freshened
up
when
they
were
ready
to
start
transferring
oxygen
to
red
dog
nagel
was
still
out
crag
hesitated
reluctant
to
leave
him
alone
the
move
could
be
fatal
if
nagel
were
the
saboteur
but
if
it
were
larkwell
he
might
find
himself
pitted
against
two
men
the
outlook
was
encouraging
he
cast
one
more
glance
at
the
recumbent
figure
and
made
up
his
mind
he
be
out
for
a
long
time
larkwell
commented
as
if
reading
his
mind
yeah
crag
replaced
nagel
oxygen
cylinder
with
a
fresh
one
closed
his
face
plate
and
opened
the
pressure
valve
on
his
suit
he
waited
until
the
others
were
ready
and
depressurized
the
cabin
he
climbed
down
the
ladder
thinking
he
would
have
to
return
before
the
oxygen
in
cylinder
was
exhausted
each
man
carried
three
cylinders
when
they
reached
red
dog
larkwell
scrambled
down
into
the
rill
and
moved
the
oxygen
cylinders
which
crag
and
richter
lowered
into
the
rocket
through
the
new
airlock
they
increased
the
load
to
four
cylinders
each
on
the
following
trip
a
decision
crag
regretted
long
before
they
reached
red
dog
it
was
a
nightmarish
trek
that
left
him
staggering
with
sheer
fatigue
he
marveled
at
larkwell
and
richter
both
were
small
men
physically
small
but
tough
he
thought
tough
and
durable
nagel
was
awake
waiting
for
them
when
they
returned
for
another
load
he
greeted
them
with
a
slightly
sheepish
look
guess
i
caved
in
that
you
did
crag
affirmed
not
that
i
can
blame
you
i
just
about
at
that
point
myself
nagel
spoke
listlessly
alpine
sent
a
message
oh
crag
waited
expectantly
colonel
gotch
he
said
the
latest
figures
indicated
the
rocket
would
strike
south
of
alphons
at
hours
south
of
alphons
how
far
south
it
would
be
close
crag
thought
maybe
too
close
maybe
by
south
of
alphons
gotch
meant
arzachel
well
in
that
case
his
worries
would
be
over
he
looked
at
the
master
chrono
time
for
two
more
trips
if
they
hurried
they
were
making
their
last
trip
to
bandit
larkwell
led
the
way
with
crag
bringing
up
the
rear
they
trudged
slowly
tiredly
haunted
by
the
shortness
of
time
yet
they
had
pushed
themselves
to
their
limit
they
simply
could
move
faster
strange
crag
thought
there
a
rocket
in
the
sky
a
warhead
a
nuclear
bomb
hurtling
down
from
the
vastness
of
space
slanting
in
on
its
target
the
target
adam
crag
and
crew
if
we
survive
this
what
next
the
question
haunted
him
how
much
could
they
take
specifically
how
much
could
take
he
shook
the
mood
off
he
take
what
he
had
to
take
he
thought
more
load
and
we
hole
the
prospect
of
ending
their
toil
perked
up
his
spirits
during
the
time
of
the
bomb
sleep
sleep
sleep
and
eat
and
rest
and
sleep
some
more
halfway
to
bandit
he
suddenly
sensed
something
wrong
richter
form
ahead
was
a
black
shadow
beyond
him
nagel
was
a
blob
of
movement
he
flicked
his
torch
on
shooting
its
beams
into
the
darkness
beyond
the
oxygen
man
larkwell
there
was
no
sign
of
larkwell
he
quickened
his
pace
weaving
the
light
back
and
forth
on
both
sides
of
their
path
larkwell
his
voice
was
imperative
no
answer
larkwell
silence
mocked
him
richter
stopped
short
nagel
turned
coming
toward
him
in
the
night
where
larkwell
he
was
ahead
of
me
it
was
nagel
richter
shrugged
ca
see
that
far
ahead
crag
thoughts
came
in
a
jumbled
train
had
larkwell
been
hit
by
a
meteorite
no
they
would
have
seen
him
fall
must
have
drawn
ahead
richter
observed
quietly
there
was
something
in
his
voice
that
disturbed
crag
why
does
he
answer
nagel
cut
in
why
why
larkwell
larkwell
answer
me
silence
a
great
silence
a
suspicion
struck
his
mind
crag
caught
his
breath
horrified
at
the
thought
let
get
moving
fast
he
struck
out
in
the
direction
of
bandit
forcing
his
tired
legs
into
a
trot
his
boots
struck
against
the
plain
shooting
needles
of
pain
up
his
legs
his
body
grew
sweaty
and
clammy
hot
and
cold
by
turn
a
chill
foreboding
gripped
him
he
tried
to
light
the
way
with
his
torch
the
rocks
made
elusive
shadows
shadows
that
danced
receded
grew
and
shortened
by
turn
until
he
discriminate
between
shadow
and
rock
he
stumbled
fell
heavily
holding
his
breath
fearfully
until
he
was
his
suit
had
ripped
after
that
he
slowed
his
pace
moving
more
carefully
his
torch
was
a
yellow
eye
preceding
him
across
the
plain
bandit
rose
before
him
jutting
against
the
stars
an
ominous
black
shadow
he
moved
his
light
playing
it
over
the
plain
larkwell
where
was
larkwell
the
yellow
beam
caressed
the
rocket
wandering
over
its
base
something
was
wrong
dreadfully
wrong
it
took
him
an
instant
to
realize
that
the
rope
ladder
had
vanished
he
swung
the
torch
upward
its
yellow
beams
framed
larkwell
body
against
the
hatch
larkwell
crag
called
imperiously
the
figure
in
the
hatch
did
move
richter
came
up
and
stood
beside
him
crag
cast
a
helpless
glance
at
him
the
german
was
silent
motionless
his
face
turned
upward
toward
the
space
cabin
as
if
he
were
lost
in
contemplation
crag
called
again
anger
in
his
voice
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
before
a
voice
tinkled
in
his
earphones
larkwell
there
no
larkwell
here
the
words
were
spoken
slowly
tauntingly
crag
snapped
wrathfully
this
is
no
time
to
be
joking
toss
that
ladder
down
and
make
it
quick
the
silence
mocked
him
for
a
long
moment
before
larkwell
answered
i
not
joking
mister
crag
he
emphasized
the
word
there
is
no
larkwell
at
least
not
here
a
fearful
premonition
came
to
crag
he
turned
toward
richter
the
german
had
moved
he
touched
his
arm
and
began
edging
back
until
he
was
well
clear
of
the
base
of
the
rocket
nagel
stood
off
to
one
side
seeming
helpless
and
forlorn
in
the
drama
being
enacted
crag
marshaled
his
thoughts
larkwell
my
name
is
malin
if
it
interest
you
mister
crag
igor
malin
the
words
were
spoken
in
a
jeer
crag
felt
the
anger
well
inside
him
all
the
emotion
he
had
suppressed
since
leaving
earth
boiled
volcanically
until
his
body
shook
like
a
leaf
the
scar
on
his
face
tingled
burned
and
he
involuntarily
reached
to
rub
it
before
remembering
his
helmet
he
waited
until
the
first
tremors
had
passed
then
spoke
trying
to
keep
his
voice
calm
you
disturbed
larkwell
you
do
know
what
you
doing
no
you
think
not
crag
bit
his
lip
vexedly
he
spoke
again
so
you
our
saboteur
call
me
that
if
you
wish
and
a
damned
traitor
not
a
traitor
mister
crag
to
the
contrary
i
have
been
very
faithful
to
my
country
you
a
traitor
crag
stated
coldly
come
be
reasonable
a
traitor
is
one
who
betrays
his
country
you
work
for
your
side
i
work
for
mine
it
as
simple
as
that
he
spoke
languidly
but
crag
knew
he
was
laughing
at
him
he
made
an
effort
to
control
his
his
temper
you
were
born
in
the
united
states
crag
pursued
wrong
again
raised
in
the
maple
hill
orphanage
i
have
your
personnel
record
ah

martin

well
planned
tactic

crag
and

happy
enough
to
be
able
to
shed
his
miserable
identity
what
do
you
expect
to
gain
crag
asked
he
kept
his
voice
reasonable
hedging
for
time
come
now
mister
crag
you
know
the
stakes
the
moon
goes
to
the
country
whose
living
representative
is
based
here
when
the
makes
its
decision
which
should
be
soon
note
that
i
said
most
of
the
supplies
are
in
red
dog
crag
pointed
out
there
enough
here
for
one
man
the
voice
was
maddeningly
bland
in
crag
earphones
you
wo
live
through
the
rockstorm
crag
promised
savagely
the
chances
of
a
direct
hit
are
pretty
remote
you
said
that
yourself
maybe
that
good
enough
for
me
damn
you
larkwell
you
ca
do
this
throw
that
ladder
down
it
was
nagel
again
the
scream
came
over
the
earphones
throw
it
down
i
say
you
made
a
mistake
crag
cut
in
calmly
we
can
survive
enough
oxygen
in
red
dog
i
opened
each
cylinder
you
handed
down
the
man
in
the
hatch
stated
in
fact
i
opened
all
of
the
cylinders
in
red
dog
sorry
mister
crag
but
the
oxygen
all
gone
soon
you
follow
prochaska
you
did
that
crag
voice
was
a
savage
growl
this
is
war
mister
crag
prochaska
was
an
enemy
he
spoke
almost
conversationally
crag
had
the
feeling
that
everyone
was
crazy
it
was
a
fantastic
dream
a
nightmare
soon
he
awaken
coward
nagel
screamed
coward
damned
coward
the
figure
in
the
hatch
vanished
into
the
rocket
he
armed
mind
seized
on
die
knowledge
that
two
automatic
rifles
were
still
in
bandit
he
ordered
the
men
back
alarmed
nagel
stood
his
ground
screaming
maledictions
come
back
gordon
crag
snapped
malin
reappeared
a
few
seconds
later
holding
a
rifle
crag
snapped
his
torch
off
leaving
the
plain
in
darkness
move
back
he
ordered
again
i
wo
i
going
to
get
into
that
rocket
nagel
babbled
he
lunged
forward
and
was
lost
in
the
darkness
before
crag
could
stop
him
nagel
get
back
here
that
an
order
i
wo
i
wo
his
scream
was
painful
in
crag
ears
a
yellow
beam
flashed
down
from
the
hatch
and
ran
over
the
ground
at
the
base
of
the
rocket
it
stopped
pinning
nagel
in
a
circle
of
light
his
face
was
turned
up
he
was
cursing
wildly
violently
nagel
crag
shouted
a
warning
nagel
shook
his
fist
toward
the
hatch
still
screaming
flame
spurted
from
the
black
rectangle
and
he
fell
crumpled
on
the
plain
move
further
back
richter
said
quietly
crag
stood
indecisively
richter
spoke
more
imperatively
he
gone
move
back
while
you
can
happy
dreams
mister
crag
and
a
long
sleep
the
hatch
closed
chapter
nagel
was
dead
he
lay
sprawled
in
the
ash
a
pitifully
small
limp
bundle
in
a
deflated
suit
he
had
gotten
his
wish
he
would
never
see
earth
again
the
wide
and
starry
now
he
was
asleep
with
his
dream
asleep
in
the
fantastically
bizarre
world
he
had
come
to
love
but
the
fact
still
remained
nagel
had
been
murdered
murdered
in
cold
blood
murdered
by
the
killer
of
little
max
prochaska
and
now
the
killer
was
in
command
crag
looked
down
at
the
crumpled
body
reliving
the
scene
feeling
it
burn
in
his
brain
finally
he
rose
filled
with
a
terrible
cold
anger
there
one
thing
he
forgot
what
richter
asked
the
cylinders
in
drone
baker
we
did
move
them
he
looked
at
his
oxygen
gauge
low
baker
lay
almost
four
miles
to
the
east
on
a
trail
seldom
used
they
had
never
traversed
it
by
night
baker
in
fact
had
become
the
forgotten
drone
he
probed
his
mind
there
was
a
spur
of
intervening
rock
rills
a
twisty
trail
threading
between
lofty
pinnacles
well
have
to
hurry
richter
urged
let
move
they
started
toward
the
east
walking
silently
side
by
side
their
former
relationship
forgotten
crag
accepted
the
fact
that
their
survival
the
success
of
his
mission
gotch
plans
could
very
well
depend
upon
what
richter
did
or
did
do
he
had
suddenly
become
an
integral
part
in
the
complex
machine
labeled
step
one
they
reached
the
ridge
which
lay
between
them
and
the
drone
and
started
upward
climbing
slowly
silently
measuring
distance
against
time
in
which
time
represented
oxygen
the
climb
over
the
ridge
proved
extremely
hazardous
despite
their
torches
they
more
than
once
brushed
sharp
needles
of
rock
and
stumbled
over
low
jagged
extrusions
they
were
panting
heavily
before
they
reached
the
crest
and
started
down
the
opposite
side
they
reached
the
plain
and
crag
checked
his
oxygen
gauge
the
reading
alarmed
him
he
did
say
anything
to
richter
but
speeded
his
pace
the
german
breath
became
a
hoarse
rumble
in
the
earphones
stop
there
was
consternation
in
richter
warning
cry
crag
simultaneously
saw
the
chasm
yawning
almost
at
their
feet
richter
said
quietly
which
way
damned
if
i
know
crag
flashed
his
torch
into
the
rill
it
was
wide
and
deep
a
cleft
with
almost
vertical
sides
they
would
have
to
go
around
it
he
flashed
the
light
in
both
directions
along
the
plain
there
was
no
visible
end
to
the
fissure
he
studied
the
stars
briefly
and
said
east
is
to
our
right
we
have
to
work
along
the
rill
and
gamble
that
it
ends
soon
it
did
they
rounded
its
end
and
resumed
their
way
toward
the
east
crag
had
to
stop
several
times
to
get
his
bearings
the
shadows
danced
before
the
torch
beams
confusing
him
causing
odd
illusions
he
fell
to
navigating
by
the
stars
it
occurred
to
him
that
baker
measured
against
the
expanse
of
the
plain
would
be
but
a
speck
of
dust
richter
voice
broke
reflectively
into
his
earphones
oxygen
about
gone
looks
like
this
place
is
going
to
wind
up
a
graveyard
crag
said
stubbornly
we
make
it
it
better
be
soon
we
should
be
about
there
they
topped
a
small
rise
and
dropped
back
to
the
plain
the
needle
of
drone
baker
punctuated
the
sky
blotted
out
the
stars
oxygen
oxygen
the
word
was
sweet
music
he
broke
into
a
run
reached
its
base
and
clawed
at
the
ladder
leading
to
its
hold
he
got
inside
panting
heavily
conscious
of
a
slightly
dizzy
feeling
and
grabbed
the
first
cylinder
he
saw
he
hooked
it
into
his
suit
system
before
looking
down
toward
the
plain
richter
was
not
in
sight
filled
with
alarm
he
grabbed
another
cylinder
and
hurried
down
the
ladder
his
torch
picked
up
richter
form
near
the
base
of
the
rocket
he
hooked
the
cylinder
into
his
suit
system
and
turned
the
valve
hoping
he
was
in
time
then
flashed
his
torch
on
the
german
face
he
seemed
to
be
breathing
crag
called
experimentally
into
the
earphone
without
answer
he
finally
snapped
off
the
torch
to
conserve
the
battery
and
waited
his
mind
a
jumble
of
thoughts
commander
good
i
was
scared
for
a
moment
he
flashed
the
torch
down
eyes
were
open
he
was
smiling
faintly
not
a
bad
way
to
go
he
managed
to
say
nice
and
easy
the
only
place
you
going
is
red
dog
i
be
okay
in
a
minute
sure
you
will
richter
struggled
to
his
feet
breathing
deeply
i
okay
we
better
get
some
more
oxygen
enough
to
last
through
the
fireworks
crag
suggested
they
returned
to
the
drone
and
procured
eight
cylinders
lowering
them
with
a
piece
of
line
supplied
for
the
purpose
they
climbed
down
to
the
plain
packed
the
cylinders
and
started
for
red
dog
going
to
be
close
but
we
make
it
crag
said
thinking
of
the
warhead
richter
answered
confidently
we
make
it
strange
crag
thought
i
wind
up
fighting
with
the
enemy
to
keep
one
of
my
own
crew
from
murdering
me
enemy
no
he
could
no
longer
brand
richter
an
enemy
he
felt
a
pang
of
regret
over
the
way
he
mistrusted
him
still
there
had
been
no
other
course
a
thought
jolted
him
he
spoke
casually
aware
he
might
be
stepping
on
richter
toes
one
thing
i
do
understand
what
larkwell
an
enemy
agent
he
hesitated
and
why
did
he
attempt
to
solicit
your
aid
crag
finished
bluntly
you
a
spaceman
commander
not
an
intelligence
agent
i
do
get
the
connection
an
agent
trusts
no
one
and
a
saboteur
is
the
lone
wolf
of
the
agents
trust
me
ha
he
just
as
soon
trust
your
good
colonel
gotch
no
larkwell
would
have
trusted
me
never
crag
was
silent
an
agent
who
could
trust
a
soldier
of
his
own
country
even
when
the
chips
were
down
it
was
a
philosophy
he
understand
as
for
larkwell
he
vowed
he
live
long
enough
to
see
him
dead
more
he
kill
him
himself
he
was
planning
how
he
accomplish
it
when
they
reached
the
rill
where
red
dog
was
buried
he
switched
his
torch
on
and
ran
it
along
the
edge
of
the
chasm
until
he
located
the
rope
ladder
leading
down
to
the
airlock
you
lower
and
i
pack
crag
ordered
he
descended
into
the
rill
and
began
moving
the
cylinders
richter
lowered
to
him
finished
he
examined
the
cylinders
they
had
brought
earlier
empty
his
lips
set
in
a
thin
line
as
he
examined
the
cylinders
which
the
rocket
had
brought
from
earth
empty
all
empty
larkwell
had
done
a
thorough
job
he
gritted
his
teeth
before
he
was
through
he
ram
the
empty
cylinders
down
larkwell
throat
yeah
and
that
was
all
he
contemplated
the
procedure
larkwell
would
die
die
horribly
he
looked
toward
the
hatch
wondering
what
was
detaining
richter
he
waited
a
moment
then
climbed
back
to
the
plain
the
german
was
nowhere
in
sight
richter
there
was
no
answer
he
checked
his
interphone
to
make
sure
it
was
working
and
called
again
silence
he
swept
his
torch
over
the
plain
no
richter
the
german
had
vanished
disappeared
into
the
black
maw
of
the
crater
richter
richter
answer
me
silence
apprehension
swept
him
he
called
again
desperately
richter
i
all
right
commander
richter
voice
was
low
seeming
to
have
come
from
a
distance
you
better
get
back
into
red
dog
where
are
you
crag
demanded
i
have
a
job
to
do
come
back
the
german
did
answer
crag
was
about
to
start
in
pursuit
when
he
realized
he
did
have
the
faintest
idea
what
direction
richter
had
taken
he
hesitated
baffled
and
fearful
by
turn
periodically
he
called
his
name
without
receiving
an
answer
he
fumed
wondering
what
the
german
had
in
mind
he
could
get
into
bandit
and
besides
he
was
unarmed
he
popped
back
into
red
dog
and
looked
at
the
chrono
if
gotch
figures
were
right
the
warhead
would
strike
in
four
minutes
he
climbed
out
of
the
rill
warhead
due
in
less
than
four
minutes
he
called
into
his
mike
get
back
into
red
dog
commander
richter
insisted
crag
snapped
irritably
what
the
hell
are
you
trying
to
do
commander
many
people
have
crossed
the
frontier
from
east
to
west
many
others
have
wanted
to
i
do
get
you
i
had
to
come
all
the
way
to
arzachel
to
find
my
frontier
commander
richter
come
back
crag
ordered
his
voice
level
there
nothing
you
can
do
you
did
know
it
but
when
i
landed
here
i
crossed
the
frontier
commander
i
went
from
east
to
west
on
the
moon
richter
now
i
am
free
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
but
you
better
get
back
here
and
pronto
you
get
massacred
if
you
on
the
plain
when
the
rocket
hits
inwardly
he
was
shaken
there
not
a
damn
thing
you
can
do
about
larkwell
ah
but
there
is
he
forgot
two
things
commander
the
oxygen
in
baker
was
only
the
first
and
the
second
richter
did
not
answer
crag
called
again
no
answer
he
waited
uncertain
what
to
do
next
the
ground
twisted
violently
under
his
feet
the
warhead
a
series
of
diminishing
quakes
rolled
the
plain
in
sharp
jolts
missed
arzachel
he
thought
jubilantly
it
missed
missed
he
twisted
his
head
upward
the
sky
was
black
black
a
great
black
spread
that
reached
to
infinity
broken
only
by
the
brilliance
of
the
stars
off
to
one
side
betelgeuse
was
a
baleful
red
eye
in
the
shoulder
of
orion
a
picture
of
what
was
happening
flashed
through
his
mind
somewhere
between
alphons
and
arzachel
thousands
of
tons
of
rock
were
hurtling
upward
in
great
ballistic
trajectories
parabolic
courses
which
would
bring
them
crashing
back
onto
the
lunar
surface
many
would
escape
would
hurtle
through
space
until
infinity
ended
some
would
be
caught
in
the
gravisphere
of
planets
would
crash
down
into
strange
worlds
but
most
would
smash
back
on
the
moon
rocks
ranging
in
size
from
grains
of
dust
to
giants
capable
of
smashing
skyscrapers
would
fall
like
rain
richter
richter
he
repeated
the
call
several
times
no
answer
he
swept
his
torch
futilely
over
the
plain
richter
was
a
dedicated
man
if
the
coming
rain
of
death
held
any
fears
for
him
he
failed
to
show
it
he
looked
up
again
fancying
that
he
saw
movement
against
the
stars
somewhere
up
there
mountains
were
hurtling
through
the
void
he
hurriedly
descended
into
the
rill
hesitated
then
moved
into
the
rocket
he
again
hesitated
before
leaving
the
airlock
open
richter
might
return
after
a
while
he
felt
the
first
thud
a
jolt
that
shook
the
rocket
and
traveled
through
his
body
like
a
wave
the
floor
danced
under
his
feet
he
held
his
breath
expectantly
suppressing
an
instant
of
panic
the
rocket
vibrated
several
times
but
none
of
the
jolts
was
as
severe
as
the
first
he
waited
aware
of
the
stillness
a
silence
so
deep
it
was
like
a
great
thunder
the
big
stuff
must
all
be
down
the
thought
bolstered
his
courage
the
idea
of
being
squashed
like
a
bug
was
not
appealing
he
waited
wondering
if
richter
had
survived
he
thought
of
larkwell
and
involuntarily
clenched
his
fists
larkwell
or
igor
malin
if
he
lived
would
be
his
first
order
of
business
he
remembered
nagel
and
prochaska
and
began
planning
how
he
would
kill
the
man
in
bandit
he
waited
a
while
longer
the
absolute
silence
grated
his
ears
now
he
thought
he
slipped
on
a
fresh
oxygen
cylinder
and
hooked
a
spare
into
his
belt
then
pawed
through
the
supplies
until
he
found
fresh
batteries
for
his
torch
finally
he
got
one
of
the
automatic
rifles
from
red
arsenal
after
that
he
climbed
up
to
the
plain
he
called
richter
name
several
times
over
the
phones
with
little
hope
of
answer
he
looked
at
the
sky
then
swept
his
torch
over
the
moonscape
a
feeling
of
solitude
assailed
him
for
the
first
time
since
leaving
earth
he
was
totally
alone
the
last
time
he
had
experienced
such
a
feeling
was
when
he
pushed
an
experimental
rocket
ship
almost
to
the
edge
of
space
he
shook
off
the
feeling
and
debated
what
to
do
richter
undoubtedly
was
dead
had
larkwell
or
was
it
malin
survived
the
rock
storm
spurred
to
action
he
turned
toward
bandit
nothing
seemed
changed
he
thought
or
almost
nothing
here
and
there
the
smooth
ash
was
pitted
once
he
came
to
a
jagged
rock
which
lay
almost
astride
his
path
he
was
sure
it
been
there
before
he
moved
more
cautiously
as
he
drew
near
bandit
remembering
that
the
occupant
of
the
rocket
was
armed
he
climbed
a
familiar
knoll
searching
the
plain
ahead
with
his
torch
he
stopped
puzzled
flashing
the
light
to
check
his
bearings
satisfied
he
was
on
the
right
knoll
he
played
the
light
ahead
again
while
moving
down
to
the
plain
he
walked
slowly
forward
once
he
dropped
to
the
ground
to
see
if
he
could
discern
the
bulk
of
bandit
against
the
stars
finally
he
walked
faster
sweeping
the
torch
over
the
plain
in
wide
arcs
suddenly
he
stopped
gone
bandit
was
gone
it
could
be
it
might
be
demolished
smashed
flat
but
it
could
disappear
he
wondered
if
he
were
having
hallucinations
no
he
was
sane
completely
sane
he
began
calling
richter
name
the
silence
mocked
him
finally
he
turned
back
toward
red
dog
crag
slept
he
slept
with
the
airlock
closed
and
the
cabin
flooded
with
oxygen
he
slept
the
sleep
of
the
dead
a
luxurious
sleep
without
thought
or
dream
when
he
awakened
he
ate
and
donned
the
pressure
suit
thinking
he
would
have
to
get
more
oxygen
from
the
drone
he
opened
the
hatch
and
scrambled
out
the
plain
was
light
the
sun
was
an
intolerable
circle
hanging
at
the
very
edge
of
the
horizon
he
blinked
his
eyes
to
get
them
used
to
the
glare
he
studied
the
plain
for
a
long
time
then
hefted
the
rifle
and
started
toward
bandit
before
he
remembered
there
was
no
bandit
no
bandit
when
he
reached
the
top
of
the
knoll
he
knew
he
was
right
bandit
unaccountably
was
gone
he
searched
the
area
in
wide
circles
the
question
grew
in
his
mind
he
found
several
twisted
pieces
of
metal
a
jagged
piece
of
engine
abruptly
he
found
richter
he
was
dead
his
suit
hung
limp
airless
against
his
body
he
stared
at
the
object
next
to
richter
it
was
a
moment
before
he
recognized
it
as
the
rocket
launcher
forgot
two
things
commander
now
he
understood
richter
words
now
he
knew
the
motive
that
had
driven
him
onto
the
plain
in
the
face
of
the
rock
storm
richter
had
used
the
launcher
to
destroy
bandit
to
destroy
the
murderer
of
prochaska
and
nagel
he
marveled
that
richter
could
have
carried
the
heavy
weapon
once
before
he
had
watched
two
men
struggle
under
its
weight
richter
must
have
mustered
every
ounce
of
his
strength
he
looked
at
the
fallen
form
for
a
long
time
richter
had
crossed
his
frontier
at
last
he
turned
and
started
toward
red
dog
adam
crag
the
man
in
the
moon
now
he
was
really
the
man
in
the
moon
the
only
man
colonel
crag
commanding
officer
pickering
field
general
crag
of
the
first
moon
expeditionary
force
adam
crag
emperor
of
luna
he
laughed
a
mirthless
laugh
damned
if
he
could
be
anything
he
wanted
to
be
on
the
moon
the
sun
climbed
above
the
rim
of
arzachel
transforming
the
vast
depressed
interior
of
the
crater
into
a
caldron
of
heat
and
glare
in
the
morning
of
the
lunar
day
the
rock
structures
rising
from
the
plain
cast
lengthy
black
shadows
over
the
ashy
floor
a
mosaic
in
black
and
white
crag
kept
busy
he
stripped
the
drones
of
their
scant
amount
of
usable
supplies
mainly
oxygen
cylinders
from
baker
and
set
up
a
new
communication
post
in
red
dog
in
the
first
hours
of
the
new
morning
gotch
named
the
saboteur
crag
listened
wearily
just
then
he
interested
in
the
fact
that
an
alert
intelligence
agent
had
doubted
that
a
man
of
could
have
been
a
star
basketball
player
as
the
superintendent
of
the
maple
hill
orphanage
had
said
he
expressed
his
feelings
by
shutting
off
the
communicator
in
the
middle
of
the
explanation
the
sun
climbed
slowly
until
it
hung
overhead
ending
a
morning
which
had
lasted
seven
earth
days
in
length
at
midday
the
shadows
had
all
but
vanished
he
finished
marking
the
last
of
three
crosses
and
stepped
back
to
survey
his
work
he
read
the
names
at
the
head
of
the
mounds
max
prochaska
gordon
nagel
otto
richter
each
was
followed
by
a
date
out
on
the
plain
were
other
graves
those
of
the
crewmen
of
bandit
and
red
dog
he
had
marked
each
mound
with
a
small
pile
of
stones
later
it
struck
him
that
someday
there
might
be
peace
someday
someone
might
want
to
look
at
one
of
those
piles
of
stone
he
returned
and
added
a
notation
to
each
the
sun
moved
imperceptibly
across
the
sky
it
seemed
to
hover
above
the
horizon
for
a
long
while
before
slipping
beyond
the
rim
night
seemed
eternal
crag
worked
and
slept
and
waited
he
measured
his
oxygen
rationed
his
food
and
planned
he
was
tough
he
survive
if
only
to
read
gotch
off
he
promised
himself
savagely
the
sun
came
up
again
in
time
it
set
rose
and
set
crag
waited
he
watched
the
silvery
ship
let
down
it
backed
down
slowly
gracefully
coming
to
rest
on
the
ashy
plain
with
scarcely
a
jar
somehow
he
feel
jubilant
he
waited
gravely
watching
the
figures
that
came
from
the
ship
he
was
surprised
that
the
first
one
was
colonel
michael
gotch
later
they
gathered
in
the
small
crew
room
of
the
astronaut
the
name
of
the
first
spaceship
they
waited
solemnly
gotch
and
crag
the
pilot
and
two
crewmen
waiting
for
the
thin
man
to
speak
just
now
he
was
sitting
at
the
small
pulldown
chow
table
peering
at
some
papers
records
of
the
moon
expedition
finally
he
looked
up
it
seems
to
me
that
your
nation
claim
to
the
moon
is
justified
he
said
the
words
were
fateful
the
thin
man
name
was
fredrick
gunter
he
was
also
of
the
united
nations
jeff
sutton
although
experienced
in
journalistic
and
technical
writings
has
only
recently
turned
his
hand
to
novels
with
the
result
that
on
the
is
also
his
first
novel
a
native
californian
and
a
marine
veteran
he
is
presently
employed
as
a
research
engineer
for
diego
specializing
appropriately
enough
for
this
novel
in
problems
of
high
altitude
survival
he
says
of
himself
i
have
long
been
a
reader
a
common
ailment
among
scientists
and
engineers
on
the
personal
side
a
number
of
factors
have
coalesced
to
pin
me
to
the
typewriter
i
am
living
in
and
working
in
a
world
of
missiles
rockets
and
dreams
in
many
areas
the
border
between
and
science
suddenly
has
become
a
lace
curtain
it
is
a
world
i
have
some
