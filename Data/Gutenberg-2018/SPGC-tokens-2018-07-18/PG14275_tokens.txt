robert
hugh
benson
i
i
am
very
much
distressed
about
it
all
murmured
baxter
she
was
a
small
old
lady
very
true
to
type
indeed
with
the
silvery
hair
of
the
devout
widow
crowned
with
an
exquisite
lace
cap
in
a
filmy
black
dress
with
a
complexion
of
precious
china
kind
shortsighted
blue
eyes
and
white
hands
busy
now
upon
needlework
she
bore
about
with
her
always
an
atmosphere
of
piety
humble
tender
and
sincere
but
as
persistent
as
the
gentle
sandalwood
aroma
which
breathed
from
her
dress
her
theory
of
the
universe
as
the
girl
who
watched
her
now
was
beginning
to
find
out
was
impregnable
and
unapproachable
events
which
conflicted
with
it
were
either
not
events
or
they
were
so
exceptional
as
to
be
negligible
if
she
were
hard
pressed
she
emitted
a
pathetic
peevishness
that
rendered
further
argument
impossible
the
room
in
which
she
sat
reflected
perfectly
her
personality
in
spite
of
the
early
victorian
date
of
the
furniture
there
was
in
its
arrangement
and
selection
a
taste
so
exquisite
as
to
deprive
it
of
even
a
suspicion
of
philistinism
somehow
the
rosewood
table
on
which
the
september
morning
sun
fell
with
serene
beauty
did
not
conflict
as
it
ought
to
have
done
with
the
tudor
paneling
of
the
room
a
tapestry
screen
veiled
the
door
into
the
hall
and
soft
curtains
of
velvety
gold
hung
on
either
side
of
the
tall
modern
windows
leading
to
the
garden
for
the
rest
the
furniture
was
charming
and
suitable
low
chairs
a
tapestry
couch
a
multitude
of
little
books
on
every
table
and
two
low
carved
bookshelves
on
either
side
of
the
door
filled
with
poetry
and
devotion
the
girl
who
sat
upright
with
her
hands
on
her
lap
was
of
another
type
altogether
of
that
type
of
which
it
is
impossible
to
predicate
anything
except
that
it
makes
itself
felt
in
every
company
any
respectable
astrologer
would
have
had
no
difficulty
in
assigning
her
birth
to
the
sign
of
the
scorpion
in
outward
appearance
she
was
not
remarkable
though
extremely
pleasing
and
it
was
a
pleasingness
that
grew
upon
acquaintance
her
beauty
such
as
it
was
was
based
upon
a
good
foundation
upon
regular
features
a
slightly
cleft
rounded
chin
a
quantity
of
dark
coiled
hair
and
large
steady
serene
brown
eyes
her
hands
were
not
small
but
beautifully
shaped
her
figure
slender
well
made
and
always
at
its
ease
in
any
attitude
in
fact
she
had
an
air
of
repose
strength
and
competence
and
contrasted
with
the
other
she
resembled
a
eyeing
an
angora
cat
they
were
talking
now
about
laurie
baxter
dear
laurie
is
so
impetuous
and
sensitive
murmured
his
mother
drawing
her
needle
softly
through
the
silk
and
then
patting
her
material
and
it
is
all
terribly
sad
this
was
undeniable
and
maggie
said
nothing
though
her
lips
opened
as
if
for
speech
then
she
closed
them
again
and
sat
watching
the
twinkling
fire
of
logs
upon
the
hearth
then
once
more
baxter
took
up
the
tale
when
i
first
heard
of
the
poor
girl
death
she
said
it
seemed
to
me
so
providential
it
would
have
been
too
dreadful
if
he
had
married
her
he
was
away
from
home
you
know
on
thursday
when
it
happened
but
he
was
back
here
on
friday
and
has
been
like
like
a
madman
ever
since
i
have
done
what
i
could
but
was
she
quite
impossible
asked
the
girl
in
her
slow
voice
i
never
saw
her
you
know
baxter
laid
down
her
embroidery
my
dear
she
was
well
i
have
not
a
word
against
her
character
of
course
she
was
all
that
was
good
i
believe
but
you
know
her
home
her
father
well
what
can
you
expect
from
a
grocer
and
a
baptist
she
added
with
a
touch
of
vindictiveness
what
was
she
like
asked
the
girl
still
with
that
meditative
air
my
dear
she
was
like
like
a
picture
on
a
i
can
say
no
more
than
that
she
was
little
and
with
a
very
pretty
complexion
and
a
ribbon
in
her
hair
always
laurie
brought
her
up
here
to
see
me
you
know
in
the
garden
i
felt
i
could
not
bear
to
have
her
in
the
house
just
yet
though
of
course
it
would
have
had
to
have
come
she
spoke
very
carefully
but
there
was
an
unmistakable
accent
once
she
left
out
an
aitch
and
then
she
said
the
word
over
again
quite
right
maggie
nodded
gently
with
a
certain
air
of
pity
and
baxter
went
on
encouraged
she
had
a
little
stammer
that
that
laurie
thought
very
pretty
and
she
had
a
restless
little
way
of
playing
with
her
fingers
as
if
on
a
piano
oh
my
dear
it
would
have
been
too
dreadful
and
now
my
poor
boy
the
old
lady
eyes
filled
with
compassionate
tears
and
she
laid
her
sewing
down
to
fetch
out
a
little
maggie
leaned
back
with
one
easy
movement
in
her
low
chair
clasping
her
hands
behind
her
head
but
she
still
said
nothing
baxter
finished
the
little
ceremony
of
wiping
her
eyes
and
still
winking
a
little
bending
over
her
needlework
continued
the
commentary
do
try
to
help
him
my
dear
that
was
why
i
asked
you
to
come
back
yesterday
i
wanted
you
to
be
in
the
house
for
the
funeral
you
see
laurie
becoming
a
catholic
at
oxford
has
brought
you
two
together
it
no
good
my
talking
to
him
about
the
religious
side
of
it
all
he
thinks
i
know
nothing
at
all
about
the
next
world
though
i
sure
tell
me
said
the
girl
suddenly
still
in
the
same
attitude
has
he
been
practicing
his
religion
you
see
i
have
seen
much
of
him
this
year
and
i
afraid
not
very
well
said
the
old
lady
tolerantly
he
thought
he
was
going
to
be
a
priest
at
first
you
remember
and
i
sure
i
should
have
made
no
objection
and
then
in
the
spring
he
seemed
to
be
getting
rather
tired
of
it
all
i
do
think
he
gets
on
with
father
mahon
very
well
i
do
think
father
mahon
understands
him
quite
it
was
he
you
know
who
told
him
not
to
be
a
priest
and
i
think
that
discouraged
poor
laurie
i
see
said
the
girl
shortly
and
baxter
applied
herself
again
to
her
sewing
it
was
indeed
a
rather
trying
time
for
the
old
lady
she
was
a
tranquil
and
serene
soul
and
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
doomed
to
live
over
a
perpetual
volcano
it
was
as
pathetic
as
an
amiable
cat
trying
to
go
to
sleep
on
a
rifle
range
she
was
developing
the
jumps
the
first
serious
explosion
had
taken
place
two
years
before
when
her
son
then
in
his
third
year
at
oxford
had
come
back
with
the
announcement
that
rome
was
the
only
home
worthy
to
shelter
his
aspiring
soul
and
that
he
must
be
received
into
the
church
in
six
weeks
time
she
had
produced
little
books
for
his
edification
as
in
duty
bound
she
had
summoned
anglican
divines
to
the
rescue
but
all
had
been
useless
and
laurie
had
gone
back
to
oxford
as
an
avowed
proselyte
she
had
soon
become
accustomed
to
the
idea
and
indeed
when
the
first
shock
was
over
had
not
greatly
disliked
it
since
her
own
adopted
daughter
of
half
french
parentage
margaret
marie
deronnais
had
been
educated
in
the
same
faith
and
was
an
eminently
satisfactory
person
the
next
shock
was
laurie
announcement
of
his
intention
to
enter
the
priesthood
and
perhaps
the
religious
life
as
well
but
this
too
had
been
tempered
by
the
reflection
that
in
that
case
maggie
would
inherit
this
house
and
carry
on
its
traditions
in
a
suitable
manner
maggie
had
come
to
her
upon
leaving
her
convent
school
three
years
before
with
a
pleasant
little
income
of
her
own
had
come
to
her
by
an
arrangement
made
previously
to
her
mother
death
and
her
manner
of
life
her
reasonableness
her
adaptability
her
presentableness
had
reassured
the
old
lady
considerably
as
to
the
tolerableness
of
the
roman
catholic
religion
indeed
once
she
had
hoped
that
laurie
and
maggie
might
come
to
an
understanding
that
would
prevent
all
possible
difficulty
as
to
the
future
of
his
house
and
estate
but
the
fourth
volcanic
storm
had
once
more
sent
the
world
flying
in
pieces
about
baxter
delicate
ears
and
during
the
last
three
months
she
had
had
to
face
the
prospect
of
laurie
bringing
home
as
a
bride
the
rather
underbred
pretty
stammering
pink
and
white
daughter
of
a
baptist
grocer
of
the
village
this
had
been
a
terrible
affair
altogether
laurie
as
is
the
custom
of
a
certain
kind
of
young
male
had
met
spoken
to
and
ultimately
kissed
this
amy
nugent
on
a
certain
summer
evening
as
the
stars
came
out
but
with
a
chivalry
not
so
common
in
such
cases
had
also
sincerely
and
simply
fallen
in
love
with
her
with
a
romance
usually
reserved
for
affections
it
seemed
from
conversation
that
amy
was
possessed
of
every
grace
of
body
mind
and
soul
required
in
one
who
was
to
be
mistress
of
the
great
house
it
was
not
so
laurie
explained
at
all
a
milkmaid
kind
of
affair
he
was
not
the
man
he
said
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
over
a
pretty
face
no
amy
was
a
rare
soul
a
flower
growing
on
stony
soil
sandy
perhaps
would
be
the
better
word
and
it
was
his
deliberate
intention
to
make
her
his
wife
then
had
followed
every
argument
known
to
mothers
for
it
was
not
likely
that
even
baxter
would
accept
without
a
struggle
a
who
five
years
before
had
bobbed
to
her
wearing
a
pinafore
and
carrying
in
a
pair
of
rather
large
hands
a
basket
of
eggs
to
her
back
door
then
she
had
consented
to
see
the
girl
and
the
interview
in
the
garden
had
left
her
more
distressed
than
ever
it
was
there
that
the
aitch
incident
had
taken
place
and
so
the
struggle
had
gone
on
laurie
had
protested
stormed
sulked
taken
refuge
in
rhetoric
and
dignity
alternately
and
his
mother
had
with
gentle
persistence
objected
held
her
peace
argued
and
resisted
conflicting
step
by
step
against
the
inevitable
seeking
to
reconcile
her
son
by
pathos
and
her
god
by
petition
and
then
in
an
instant
only
four
days
ago
it
seemed
that
the
latter
had
prevailed
and
today
laurie
in
a
black
suit
rent
by
sorrow
at
this
very
hour
at
which
the
two
ladies
sat
and
talked
in
the
was
standing
by
an
open
grave
in
the
village
churchyard
seeing
the
last
of
his
love
under
a
pile
of
blossoms
as
pink
and
white
as
her
own
complexion
within
four
with
a
brass
plate
upon
the
cover
now
therefore
there
was
a
new
situation
to
face
and
baxter
was
regarding
it
with
apprehension
it
is
true
that
mothers
know
sometimes
more
of
their
sons
than
their
sons
know
of
themselves
but
there
are
certain
elements
of
character
that
sometimes
neither
mothers
nor
sons
appreciate
it
was
one
or
two
of
those
elements
that
maggie
deronnais
with
her
hands
behind
her
head
was
now
considering
it
seemed
to
her
very
odd
that
neither
the
boy
himself
nor
baxter
in
the
least
seemed
to
realize
the
astonishing
selfishness
of
this
very
boy
actions
she
had
known
him
now
for
three
years
though
owing
to
her
own
absence
in
france
a
part
of
the
time
and
his
absence
in
london
for
the
rest
she
had
seen
nothing
of
this
last
affair
at
first
she
had
liked
him
exceedingly
he
had
seemed
to
her
ardent
natural
and
generous
she
had
liked
his
affection
for
his
mother
and
his
demonstrativeness
in
showing
it
she
had
liked
his
swagger
his
manner
with
servants
his
impulsive
courtesy
to
herself
it
was
a
real
pleasure
to
her
to
see
him
morning
by
morning
in
his
knickerbockers
and
norfolk
jacket
or
his
tweed
suit
and
evening
by
evening
in
his
coat
and
white
shirt
and
the
knee
breeches
and
buckled
shoes
that
he
wore
by
reason
of
the
touch
of
picturesque
and
defiant
romanticism
that
was
so
obvious
a
part
of
his
nature
then
she
had
begun
little
by
little
to
perceive
the
egotism
that
was
even
more
apparent
his
his
moodiness
and
his
persistence
though
naturally
she
had
approved
of
his
conversion
to
catholicism
yet
she
was
not
sure
that
his
motives
were
pure
she
had
hoped
indeed
that
the
church
with
its
astonishing
peremptoriness
might
do
something
towards
a
moral
conversion
as
well
as
an
artistic
and
intellectual
change
of
view
but
this
it
seemed
had
not
happened
and
this
final
mad
episode
of
amy
nugent
had
fanned
her
criticism
to
indignation
she
did
not
disapprove
of
romance
in
fact
she
largely
lived
by
it
but
there
were
things
even
more
important
and
she
was
as
angry
as
she
could
be
with
decency
at
this
last
manifestation
of
selfishness
for
the
worst
of
it
was
that
as
she
knew
perfectly
well
laurie
was
rather
an
exceptional
person
he
was
not
at
all
the
young
fool
of
fiction
there
was
a
remarkable
virility
about
him
he
was
to
a
degree
he
had
more
than
his
share
of
brains
it
was
intolerable
that
such
a
person
should
be
so
silly
she
wondered
what
sorrow
would
do
for
him
she
had
come
down
from
scotland
the
night
before
and
down
here
to
herefordshire
this
morning
she
had
not
then
yet
seen
him
and
he
was
now
at
the
funeral
well
sorrow
would
be
his
test
how
would
he
take
it
baxter
broke
in
on
her
meditations
maggy
darling
do
you
think
you
can
do
anything
you
know
i
once
hoped
the
girl
looked
up
suddenly
with
so
vivid
an
air
that
it
was
an
interruption
the
old
lady
broke
off
well
well
she
said
but
is
it
quite
impossible
that
please
do
i
i
ca
talk
about
that
it
impossible
utterly
impossible
the
old
lady
sighed
then
she
said
suddenly
looking
at
the
clock
above
the
oak
mantelshelf
it
is
i
expect
she
broke
off
as
the
front
door
was
heard
to
open
and
close
beyond
the
hall
and
waited
paling
a
little
as
steps
sounded
on
the
flags
but
the
steps
went
up
the
stairs
outside
and
there
was
silence
again
he
has
come
back
she
said
oh
my
dear
how
shall
you
treat
him
asked
the
girl
curiously
the
old
lady
bent
again
over
her
embroidery
i
think
i
shall
just
say
nothing
i
hope
he
will
ride
this
afternoon
will
you
go
with
him
i
think
not
he
wo
want
anyone
i
know
laurie
the
other
looked
up
at
her
sideways
in
a
questioning
way
and
maggie
went
on
with
a
kind
of
slow
decisiveness
he
will
be
queer
at
lunch
then
he
will
probably
ride
alone
and
be
late
for
tea
then
tomorrow
oh
my
dear
stapleton
is
coming
to
lunch
tomorrow
do
you
think
he
mind
who
is
mrs
stapleton
the
old
lady
hesitated
she
she
the
wife
of
colonel
stapleton
she
goes
in
for
what
i
think
is
called
new
thought
at
least
so
somebody
told
me
last
month
i
afraid
she
not
a
very
steady
person
she
was
a
vegetarian
last
year
now
i
believe
she
given
that
up
again
maggie
smiled
slowly
showing
a
row
of
very
white
strong
teeth
i

mind
much
perhaps
he
go
back
to
town
in
the
morning
too
no
my
dear
he
staying
till
thursday
there
fell
again
one
of
those
pleasant
silences
that
are
possible
in
the
country
outside
the
garden
with
the
meadows
beyond
the
village
road
lay
in
that
sweet
september
hush
of
sunlight
and
mellow
color
that
seemed
to
embalm
the
house
in
peace
from
the
farm
beyond
the
came
the
crowing
of
a
cock
followed
by
the
liquid
chuckle
of
a
pigeon
perched
somewhere
overhead
among
the
twisted
chimneys
and
within
this
room
all
was
equally
at
peace
the
sunshine
lay
on
table
and
polished
floor
barred
by
the
mullions
of
the
windows
and
stained
here
and
there
by
the
little
flemish
emblems
and
coats
that
hung
across
the
glass
while
those
two
figures
so
perfectly
in
place
in
their
serenity
and
leisure
sat
before
the
open
and
contemplated
the
very
unpeaceful
element
that
had
just
walked
upstairs
incarnate
in
a
pale
young
man
in
black
the
house
in
fact
was
one
of
those
that
have
a
personality
as
marked
and
as
mysterious
as
of
a
human
character
it
affected
people
in
quite
an
extraordinary
way
it
took
charge
of
the
casual
guest
entertained
and
soothed
and
sometimes
silenced
him
and
it
cast
upon
all
who
lived
in
it
an
enchantment
at
once
inexplicable
and
delightful
externally
it
was
nothing
remarkable
it
was
a
large
house
close
indeed
to
the
road
but
separated
from
it
by
a
high
gate
in
an
oak
paling
and
a
short
straight
originally
even
but
matured
through
centuries
with
a
queen
anne
front
of
mellow
red
brick
and
back
premises
of
tile
oak
and
modern
with
old
that
almost
enclosed
a
graveled
court
behind
behind
this
again
lay
a
great
kitchen
garden
with
paths
dividing
it
all
into
a
dozen
rectangles
separated
from
the
orchard
and
yew
walk
by
a
broad
double
hedge
down
the
center
of
which
ran
a
sheltered
path
round
the
south
of
the
house
and
in
the
narrow
strip
westwards
lay
broad
lawns
surrounded
by
high
trees
completely
shading
it
from
all
view
of
the
houses
that
formed
the
tiny
hamlet
fifty
yards
away
within
the
house
had
been
modernized
almost
to
a
commonplace
level
a
little
hall
gave
entrance
to
the
on
the
right
where
these
two
women
now
sat
a
large
stately
room
paneled
from
floor
to
ceiling
and
to
the
on
the
left
and
again
through
to
the
back
where
a
smoking
room
an
inner
hall
and
the
big
kitchens
and
back
premises
concluded
the
ground
floor
the
two
more
stories
above
consisted
on
the
first
floor
of
a
row
of
large
rooms
airy
high
and
dignified
and
in
the
attics
of
a
series
of
chambers
whitewashed
and
where
one
or
two
of
the
servants
slept
in
splendid
isolation
a
little
flight
of
irregular
steps
leading
out
of
the
big
room
on
to
the
first
floor
where
the
housekeeper
lived
in
state
gave
access
to
the
further
rooms
near
the
kitchen
and
sculleries
maggie
had
fallen
in
love
with
the
place
from
the
instant
that
she
had
entered
it
she
had
been
warned
in
her
french
convent
of
the
giddy
gaieties
of
the
world
and
its
temptations
and
yet
it
seemed
to
her
after
a
week
in
her
new
home
that
the
world
was
very
much
maligned
there
was
here
a
sense
of
peace
and
sheltered
security
that
she
had
hardly
known
even
at
school
and
little
by
little
she
had
settled
down
here
with
the
mother
and
the
son
until
it
had
begun
to
seem
to
her
that
days
spent
in
london
or
in
other
friends
houses
were
no
better
than
interruptions
and
failures
compared
with
the
leisurely
tender
life
of
this
place
where
it
was
so
easy
to
read
and
pray
and
possess
her
soul
in
peace
this
affair
of
laurie
was
almost
the
first
reminder
of
what
she
had
known
by
hearsay
that
love
and
death
and
pain
were
the
bones
on
which
life
was
modeled
with
a
sudden
movement
she
leaned
forward
took
up
the
bellows
and
began
to
blow
the
smoldering
logs
into
flame
meanwhile
upstairs
on
a
long
couch
beside
the
fire
in
his
big
lay
a
young
man
on
his
face
motionless
a
week
ago
he
had
been
one
of
those
men
who
in
almost
any
company
appear
easy
and
satisfactory
and
above
all
are
satisfactory
to
themselves
his
life
was
a
very
pleasant
one
indeed
he
had
come
down
from
oxford
just
a
year
ago
and
had
determined
to
take
things
as
they
came
to
foster
acquaintanceships
to
travel
a
little
with
a
congenial
friend
to
stay
about
in
other
houses
and
in
fact
to
enjoy
himself
entirely
before
settling
down
to
read
law
he
had
done
this
most
successfully
and
had
crowned
all
as
has
been
related
by
falling
in
love
on
a
july
evening
with
one
who
he
was
quite
certain
was
the
mate
designed
for
him
for
time
and
eternity
his
life
in
fact
up
to
three
days
ago
had
developed
along
exactly
those
lines
along
which
his
temperament
traveled
with
the
greatest
ease
he
was
the
only
son
of
a
widow
he
had
an
excellent
income
he
made
friends
wherever
he
went
and
he
had
just
secured
the
most
charming
rooms
close
to
the
temple
he
had
plenty
of
brains
an
exceedingly
warm
heart
and
had
lately
embraced
a
religion
that
satisfied
every
instinct
of
his
nature
it
was
the
best
of
all
possible
worlds
and
fitted
him
like
his
own
clothes
it
consisted
of
privileges
without
responsibilities
and
now
the
crash
had
come
and
all
was
over
as
the
gong
sounded
for
luncheon
he
turned
over
and
lay
on
his
back
staring
at
the
ceiling
it
should
have
been
a
very
attractive
face
under
other
circumstances
beneath
his
brown
curls
just
touched
with
gold
there
looked
out
a
pair
of
grey
eyes
bright
a
week
ago
now
dimmed
with
tears
and
patched
beneath
with
lines
of
sorrow
his
rather
passionate
lips
were
set
now
with
corners
in
a
line
of
angry
piteous
to
see
and
his
clear
skin
seemed
stained
and
dull
he
had
never
dreamt
of
such
misery
in
all
his
days
as
he
lay
now
with
lax
hands
at
his
side
tightening
at
times
in
an
agony
of
remembrance
he
was
seeing
vision
after
vision
turning
now
and
again
to
the
contemplation
of
a
dark
future
without
life
or
love
or
hope
again
he
saw
amy
as
he
had
first
seen
her
under
the
luminous
july
evening
jeweled
overhead
with
peeping
stars
amber
to
the
westwards
where
the
sun
had
gone
down
in
glory
she
was
in
her
and
print
dress
stepping
towards
him
across
the
meadow
grass
lately
shorn
of
its
flowers
and
growth
looking
at
him
with
that
curious
awed
admiration
that
delighted
him
with
its
flattery
her
face
was
to
the
west
the
reflected
glory
lay
on
it
as
delicate
as
the
light
on
a
flower
and
her
blue
eyes
regarded
him
beneath
a
halo
of
golden
hair
he
saw
her
again
as
she
had
been
one
moonlight
evening
as
the
two
stood
together
by
the
sluice
of
the
stream
among
the
stillness
of
the
woods
below
the
village
with
all
fairyland
about
them
and
in
their
hearts
she
had
thrown
a
wrap
about
her
head
and
stolen
down
there
by
devious
ways
according
to
the
appointment
meeting
him
as
was
arranged
as
he
came
out
from
dinner
with
all
the
glamour
of
the
great
house
about
him
in
his
evening
dress
buckled
shoes
and
all
complete
how
marvelous
she
had
been
then
a
sweet
nymph
of
flesh
and
blood
glorified
by
the
moon
to
an
ethereal
delicacy
with
the
living
pallor
of
skin
her
eyes
looking
at
him
like
stars
beneath
her
shawl
they
had
said
very
little
they
had
stood
there
at
the
sluice
gate
with
his
arm
about
her
and
herself
willingly
nestling
against
him
trembling
now
and
again
looking
out
at
the
sheeny
surface
of
the
slow
flowing
stream
from
which
in
the
imperceptible
night
breeze
stole
away
wraith
after
wraith
of
water
mist
to
float
and
lose
themselves
in
the
sleeping
woods
or
once
more
clearer
than
all
else
he
remembered
how
he
had
watched
her
himself
unseen
delaying
the
delight
of
revealing
himself
one
august
morning
scarcely
three
weeks
ago
as
she
had
come
down
the
road
that
ran
past
the
house
again
in
her
and
print
dress
with
the
dew
shining
about
her
on
grass
and
hedge
and
the
haze
of
a
summer
morning
veiling
the
intensity
of
the
blue
sky
above
he
had
called
her
then
gently
by
name
and
she
had
turned
her
face
to
him
alight
with
love
and
fear
and
sudden
wonder
he
remembered
even
now
with
a
reflection
of
memory
that
was
nearly
an
illusion
the
smell
of
yew
and
garden
flowers
this
then
had
been
the
dream
and
today
the
awakening
and
the
end
that
end
was
even
more
terrible
than
he
had
conceived
possible
on
that
horrible
friday
morning
last
week
when
he
had
opened
the
telegram
from
her
father
he
had
never
before
understood
the
sordidness
of
her
surroundings
as
when
an
hour
ago
he
had
stood
at
the
his
eyes
wandering
from
that
long
elm
box
with
the
silver
plate
and
the
wreath
of
flowers
to
the
mourners
on
the
other
side
her
father
in
his
broadcloth
his
heavy
smooth
face
pulled
in
lines
of
grotesque
sorrow
her
mother
with
her
crimson
cheeks
her
elaborate
black
her
intolerable
crape
and
her
mantle
even
these
people
had
been
seen
by
him
up
to
then
through
a
haze
of
love
he
had
thought
them
simple
honest
folk
creatures
of
the
soil
yet
wholesome
natural
and
sturdy
and
now
that
the
jewel
was
lost
the
setting
was
worse
than
empty
there
in
the
elm
box
lay
the
remnants
of
the
shattered
gem
he
had
seen
her
in
her
bed
on
the
sunday
her
fallen
face
her
sunken
eyes
all
framed
in
the
detestable
whiteness
of
linen
and
waxen
flowers
yet
as
pathetic
and
as
appealing
as
ever
and
as
necessary
to
his
life
it
was
then
that
the
supreme
fact
had
first
penetrated
to
his
consciousness
that
he
had
lost
her
the
fact
which
driven
home
by
the
funeral
scene
this
morning
the
rustling
crowd
come
to
see
the
young
squire
the
elm
box
the
heap
of
flowers
had
now
flung
him
down
on
this
couch
crushed
broken
and
hopeless
like
young
ivy
after
a
thunderstorm
his
moods
alternated
with
the
rapidity
of
flying
clouds
at
one
instant
he
was
furious
with
pain
at
the
next
broken
and
lax
from
the
same
cause
at
one
moment
he
cursed
god
and
desired
to
die
defiant
and
raging
at
the
next
he
sank
down
into
himself
as
weak
as
a
tortured
child
while
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
and
little
moans
as
of
an
animal
murmured
in
his
throat
god
was
a
hated
adversary
a
merciless
judge
a
blind
fate
there
was
no
god
he
was
a
fiend
there
was
nothing
anywhere
in
the
whole
universe
but
pain
and
vanity
yet
through
it
all
like
a
throbbing
pedal
note
ran
his
need
of
this
girl
he
would
do
anything
suffer
anything
make
any
sacrifice
momentary
or
lifelong
if
he
could
but
see
her
again
hold
her
hand
for
one
instant
look
into
her
eyes
mysterious
with
the
secret
of
death
he
had
but
three
or
four
words
to
say
to
her
just
to
secure
himself
that
she
lived
and
was
still
his
and
then
then
he
would
say
to
her
content
and
happy
to
wait
till
death
should
reunite
them
ah
he
asked
so
little
and
god
would
not
give
it
him
all
then
was
a
mockery
it
was
only
this
past
summer
that
he
had
begun
to
fancy
himself
in
love
with
maggie
deronnais
it
had
been
an
emotion
of
very
quiet
growth
developing
gently
week
by
week
feeding
on
her
wholesomeness
her
serenity
her
quiet
power
her
cool
capable
hands
and
the
look
in
her
direct
eyes
it
resembled
respect
rather
than
passion
and
need
rather
than
desire
it
was
a
hunger
rather
than
a
thirst
then
had
risen
up
this
other
blinding
and
bewildering
and
he
told
himself
he
now
knew
the
difference
his
lips
curled
into
bitter
and
resentful
lines
as
he
contemplated
the
contrast
and
all
was
gone
shattered
and
vanished
and
even
maggie
was
now
impossible
again
he
writhed
over
sick
with
pain
and
longing
and
so
lay
it
was
ten
minutes
before
he
moved
again
and
then
he
only
roused
himself
as
he
heard
a
foot
on
the
stairs
perhaps
it
was
his
mother
he
slipped
off
the
couch
and
stood
up
his
face
lined
and
creased
with
the
pressure
with
which
he
had
lain
just
now
and
smoothed
his
tumbled
clothes
yes
he
must
go
down
he
stepped
to
the
door
and
opened
it
i
am
coming
immediately
he
said
to
the
servant
he
bore
himself
at
lunch
with
a
respectable
though
he
said
little
or
nothing
his
mother
attitude
he
found
hard
to
bear
as
he
caught
her
eyes
once
or
twice
looking
at
him
with
sympathy
and
he
allowed
himself
internally
to
turn
to
maggie
with
relief
in
spite
of
his
meditations
just
now
she
at
least
respected
his
sorrow
he
told
himself
she
bore
herself
very
naturally
though
with
long
silences
and
never
once
met
his
eyes
with
her
own
he
made
his
excuses
as
soon
as
he
could
and
slipped
across
to
the
stable
yard
at
least
he
would
be
alone
this
afternoon
only
as
he
rode
away
half
an
hour
later
he
caught
a
sight
of
the
slender
little
figure
of
his
mother
waiting
to
have
one
word
with
him
if
she
could
beyond
the
but
he
set
his
lips
and
would
not
see
her
it
was
one
of
those
perfect
september
days
that
fall
sometimes
as
a
gift
from
heaven
after
the
bargain
of
summer
has
been
more
or
less
concluded
as
he
rode
all
that
afternoon
through
lanes
and
across
uplands
his
view
barred
always
to
the
north
by
the
great
downs
above
royston
against
the
radiant
sky
there
was
scarcely
a
hint
in
earth
or
heaven
of
any
emotion
except
prevailing
peace
yet
the
very
serenity
tortured
him
the
more
by
its
mockery
the
birds
babbled
in
the
deep
woods
the
cheerful
noise
of
children
reached
him
now
and
again
from
a
cottage
garden
the
mellow
light
smiled
unending
benediction
and
yet
his
subconsciousness
let
go
for
never
an
instant
of
the
long
elm
box
six
feet
below
ground
and
of
its
contents
lying
there
in
the
stifling
dark
in
the
churchyard
on
the
hill
above
his
home
he
wondered
now
and
again
as
to
the
fate
of
the
spirit
that
had
informed
the
body
and
made
it
what
it
was
but
his
imagination
refused
to
work
after
all
he
asked
himself
what
were
all
the
teachings
of
theology
but
words
gabbled
to
break
the
appalling
silence
heaven
purgatory
hell
what
was
known
of
these
things
the
very
soul
itself
what
was
that
what
was
the
inconceivable
environment
after
all
for
so
inconceivable
a
thing
he
did
not
need
these
things
he
said
certainly
not
now
nor
those
labels
and
signposts
to
a
doubtful
unimaginable
land
he
needed
amy
herself
or
at
least
some
hint
or
sound
or
glimpse
to
show
him
that
she
indeed
was
as
she
had
always
been
whether
in
earth
or
heaven
he
did
not
care
that
there
was
somewhere
something
that
was
herself
some
definite
personal
being
of
a
continuous
consciousness
with
that
which
he
had
known
characterized
still
by
those
graces
which
he
thought
he
had
recognized
and
certainly
loved
ah
he
did
not
ask
much
it
would
be
so
easy
to
god
here
out
in
this
lonely
lane
where
he
rode
beneath
the
branches
his
reins
loose
on
his
horse
neck
his
eyes
unseeing
roving
over
copse
and
meadow
across
to
the
eternal
hills
a
face
seen
for
an
instant
smiling
and
gone
again
a
whisper
in
his
ear
with
that
dear
stammer
of
shyness
a
touch
on
his
knee
of
those
rippling
fingers
that
he
had
watched
in
the
moonlight
playing
gently
on
the
above
the
moonlit
stream
he
would
tell
no
one
if
god
wished
it
to
be
a
secret
he
would
keep
it
wholly
to
himself
he
did
not
ask
now
to
possess
her
only
to
be
certain
that
she
lived
and
that
death
was
not
what
it
seemed
to
be
is
father
mahon
at
home
he
asked
as
he
halted
a
mile
from
his
own
house
in
the
village
where
stood
the
little
tin
church
not
a
hundred
yards
from
its
elder
alienated
sister
to
which
he
and
maggie
went
on
sundays
the
housekeeper
turned
from
her
beyond
the
fence
and
told
him
yes
he
dismounted
hitched
the
reins
round
the
gatepost
and
went
in
ah
what
an
antipathetic
little
room
this
was
in
which
he
waited
while
the
priest
was
being
fetched
from
upstairs
over
the
mantelpiece
hung
a
large
oleograph
of
leo
xiii
in
cope
and
tiara
blessing
with
upraised
hand
and
that
eternal
smile
a
couple
of
jars
stood
beneath
filled
with
dyed
grasses
a
briar
pipe
redolent
and
foul
lay
between
them
the
rest
of
the
room
was
in
the
same
key
a
bright
brussels
carpet
pale
and
worn
by
the
door
covered
the
floor
cheap
lace
curtains
were
pinned
across
the
windows
and
over
the
littered
table
a
painted
deal
bookshelf
held
a
dozen
volumes
devotional
moral
and
dogmatic
theology
and
by
the
side
of
that
an
illuminated
address
framed
in
gilt
and
so
on
laurie
looked
at
it
all
in
dumb
dismay
he
had
seen
it
before
again
and
again
but
had
never
realized
its
horror
as
he
realized
it
now
from
the
depths
of
his
own
misery
was
it
really
true
that
his
religion
could
emit
such
results
there
was
a
step
on
the
stairs
a
very
heavy
one
and
father
mahon
came
in
a
large
man
who
seemed
to
fill
the
room
with
a
completely
unethereal
presence
and
held
out
his
hand
with
a
certain
gravity
laurie
took
it
and
dropped
it
sit
down
my
dear
boy
said
the
priest
and
he
impelled
him
gently
to
a
laurie
stiffened
thank
you
father
but
i
must
stay
he
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
fetched
out
a
little
packet
will
you
say
mass
for
my
intention
please
and
he
laid
the
packet
on
the
mantelshelf
the
priest
took
up
the
coins
and
slipped
them
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
certainly
he
said
i
think
i
know
laurie
turned
away
with
a
little
jerk
i
must
be
going
he
said
i
only
looked
in
baxter
said
the
other
i
hope
you
will
allow
me
to
say
how
much
laurie
drew
his
breath
swiftly
with
a
hiss
as
of
pain
and
glanced
at
the
priest
you
understand
then
what
my
intention
is
why
surely
it
is
for
her
soul
is
it
not
i
suppose
so
said
the
boy
and
went
out
i
i
have
told
him
said
baxter
as
the
two
women
walked
beneath
the
yews
that
morning
after
breakfast
he
said
he
did
mind
maggie
did
not
speak
she
had
come
out
just
as
she
was
hatless
but
had
caught
up
a
spud
that
stood
in
the
hall
and
at
that
instant
had
stopped
to
destroy
a
youthful
plantain
that
had
established
himself
with
infinite
pains
on
the
slope
of
the
path
she
attacked
for
a
few
seconds
extricated
what
was
possible
of
the
root
with
her
strong
fingers
tossed
the
corpse
among
the
ivy
and
then
moved
on
i
do
know
whether
to
say
anything
to
stapleton
or
not
pursued
the
old
lady
i
think
i
should
auntie
said
the
girl
slowly
they
spoke
of
it
for
a
minute
or
two
as
they
passed
up
and
down
but
maggie
only
attended
with
one
superficies
of
her
mind
she
had
gone
up
as
usual
to
mass
that
morning
and
had
been
astonished
to
find
laurie
already
in
church
they
had
walked
back
together
and
to
her
surprise
he
had
told
her
that
the
mass
had
been
for
his
own
intention
she
had
answered
as
well
as
she
could
but
a
sentence
or
two
of
his
as
they
came
near
home
had
vaguely
troubled
her
it
was
not
that
he
had
said
anything
he
ought
not
as
a
catholic
to
have
said
yet
her
instinct
told
her
that
something
was
wrong
it
was
his
manner
his
air
that
troubled
her
what
strange
people
these
converts
were
there
was
so
much
ardor
at
one
time
so
much
chilliness
at
another
there
was
so
little
of
that
steady
workaday
acceptance
of
religious
facts
that
marked
the
born
catholic
stapleton
is
a
new
thought
kind
of
person
she
said
presently
so
i
understand
said
the
old
lady
with
a
touch
of
peevishness
a
vegetarian
last
year
and
i
believe
she
was
a
sort
of
buddhist
five
or
six
years
ago
and
then
she
nearly
became
a
christian
scientist
a
little
while
ago
maggie
smiled
i
wonder
what
she
talk
about
she
said
i
hope
she
wo
be
very
advanced
went
on
the
old
lady
and
you
think
i
better
not
tell
her
about
laurie
i
sure
it
best
not
said
the
girl
or
she
tell
him
about
deep
breathing
or
saying
om
or
something
no
i
should
let
laurie
alone
it
was
a
little
before
one
that
the
motor
arrived
and
that
there
descended
from
it
at
the
iron
gate
a
tall
slender
woman
hooded
and
veiled
who
walked
up
the
little
path
observed
by
maggie
from
her
bedroom
with
a
kind
of
whisking
step
the
motor
moved
on
wheeled
in
through
the
gates
at
the
left
and
sank
into
silence
in
the
it
too
charming
of
you
dear
baxter
maggie
heard
as
she
came
into
the
a
minute
or
two
later
to
let
me
come
over
like
this
i
heard
so
much
about
this
house
lady
laura
was
telling
me
how
very
psychical
it
all
was
my
adopted
daughter
miss
deronnais
observed
the
old
lady
maggie
saw
a
rather
pretty
passé
face
triangular
in
shape
with
small
red
lips
looking
at
her
as
she
made
her
greetings
ah
how
perfect
all
this
is
went
on
the
guest
presently
looking
about
her
how
suggestive
how
full
of
meaning
she
threw
back
her
cloak
presently
and
maggie
observed
that
she
was
busy
with
various
very
beautiful
little
emblems
a
scarab
a
snake
swallowing
its
tail
and
so
forth
all
exquisitely
made
and
hung
upon
a
slender
chain
of
some
green
material
certainly
she
was
true
to
type
as
the
full
light
fell
upon
her
it
became
plain
that
this
soul
did
not
disdain
to
use
certain
toilet
requisites
upon
her
face
and
a
curious
eastern
odor
exhaled
from
her
dress
fortunately
maggie
had
a
very
deep
sense
of
humor
and
she
hardly
resented
all
this
at
all
nor
even
the
tactful
hints
dropped
from
time
to
time
after
the
conventional
part
of
the
conversation
was
over
to
the
effect
that
christianity
was
of
course
played
out
and
that
a
higher
light
had
dawned
stapleton
did
not
quite
say
this
outright
but
it
amounted
to
as
much
even
before
laurie
came
downstairs
it
appeared
that
the
lady
did
not
go
to
church
yet
that
such
was
her
she
did
not
at
all
object
to
do
so
it
was
all
one
it
seemed
in
the
deeper
unity
nothing
particular
was
true
but
all
was
very
suggestive
and
significant
and
symbolical
of
something
else
to
which
stapleton
and
a
few
friends
had
the
key
baxter
made
more
than
one
attempt
to
get
back
to
more
mundane
subjects
but
it
was
useless
when
even
the
weather
serves
as
a
symbol
the
plain
man
is
done
for
then
laurie
came
in
he
looked
very
and
rather
pinched
this
morning
and
shook
hands
with
the
lady
without
a
word
then
they
moved
across
presently
to
the
across
the
hall
and
the
exquisite
symbol
of
luncheon
made
its
appearance
lady
laura
it
appeared
was
one
of
those
who
had
felt
the
charm
of
stantons
only
for
her
it
was
psychical
rather
than
physical
and
all
this
was
passed
on
by
her
friend
it
seemed
that
the
psychical
atmosphere
of
most
modern
houses
was
of
a
yellow
tint
but
that
this
one
emanated
a
radiance
which
was
very
peculiar
and
exceptional
indeed
it
was
this
singularity
that
had
caused
stapleton
to
apply
for
an
invitation
to
the
house
more
than
once
during
lunch
in
a
pause
of
the
conversation
maggie
saw
her
throw
back
her
head
slightly
as
if
to
appreciate
some
odor
or
color
not
experienced
by
persons
once
indeed
she
actually
put
this
into
words
dear
laura
was
quite
right
cried
the
lady
there
is
something
very
unique
about
this
place
how
fortunate
you
are
dear
mrs
baxter
my
dear
husband
grandfather
bought
the
place
observed
the
mistress
plaintively
we
have
always
found
it
very
soothing
and
pleasant
how
right
you
are
and
and
have
you
had
any
experiences
here
baxter
eyed
her
in
alarm
maggie
had
an
irrepressible
burst
of
internal
laughter
which
however
gave
no
hint
of
its
presence
in
her
steady
features
she
glanced
at
laurie
who
was
eating
mutton
with
a
depressed
air
i
was
talking
to
vincent
the
great
spiritualist
went
on
the
other
vivaciously
only
last
week
you
have
heard
of
him
baxter
i
was
suggesting
to
him
that
any
place
where
great
emotions
have
been
felt
is
colored
and
stained
by
them
as
objectively
as
old
walls
are
i
had
such
an
interesting
conversation
too
with
cardinal
newman
on
the
subject
she
smiled
brilliantly
at
maggie
as
if
to
reassure
her
of
her
own
orthodoxy
scarcely
six
weeks
ago
there
was
a
pregnant
silence
baxter
fork
sank
to
her
plate
i
do
understand
she
said
faintly
cardinal
newman
surely
why
yes
said
the
other
gently
i
know
it
sounds
very
startling
to
orthodox
ears
but
to
us
of
the
higher
thought
all
these
things
are
quite
familiar
of
course
i
need
hardly
say
that
cardinal
newman
is
no
longer
but
perhaps
i
had
better
not
go
on
she
glanced
archly
at
maggie
oh
please
go
on
said
maggie
genially
you
were
saying
that
cardinal
newman
dear
miss
deronnais
are
you
sure
you
will
not
be
offended
i
am
always
glad
to
receive
new
light
said
maggie
solemnly
the
other
looked
at
her
doubtfully
but
there
was
no
hint
of
irony
in
the
girl
face
well
she
began
of
course
on
the
other
side
they
see
things
very
differently
i
do
mean
at
all
that
any
religion
is
exactly
untrue
oh
no
they
tell
us
that
if
we
can
not
welcome
the
new
light
then
the
old
lights
will
do
very
well
for
the
present
indeed
when
there
are
catholics
present
cardinal
newman
does
not
scruple
to
give
them
a
latin
blessing
is
it
true
that
he
speaks
with
an
american
accent
asked
maggie
gravely
the
other
laughed
with
a
somewhat
shrill
geniality
that
is
too
bad
miss
deronnais
well
of
course
the
personality
of
the
medium
affects
the
vehicle
through
which
the
communications
come
that
is
no
difficulty
at
all
when
once
you
understand
the
principle
baxter
interrupted
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
stapleton
do
you
mean
that
cardinal
newman
really
speaks
to
you
why
yes
said
the
other
with
a
patient
indulgence
that
is
a
very
usual
experience
but
vincent
does
much
more
than
that
it
is
quite
a
common
experience
not
only
to
hear
him
but
to
see
him
i
have
shaken
hands
with
him
more
than
once
and
i
have
seen
a
catholic
kiss
his
ring
baxter
looked
helplessly
at
the
girl
and
maggie
came
to
the
rescue
once
more
this
sounds
rather
advanced
to
us
she
said
wo
you
explain
the
principles
first
stapleton
laid
her
knife
and
fork
down
leaned
back
and
began
to
discourse
when
a
little
later
her
plate
was
removed
she
refused
sweets
with
a
gesture
and
continued
altogether
she
spoke
for
about
ten
minutes
uninterrupted
enjoying
herself
enormously
the
others
ate
food
or
refused
it
in
attentive
silence
then
at
last
she
ended
i
know
all
this
must
sound
quite
mad
and
fanatical
to
those
who
have
not
experienced
it
and
yet
to
us
who
have
been
disciples
it
is
as
natural
to
meet
our
friends
who
have
crossed
over
as
to
meet
those
who
have
not
dear
baxter
think
how
all
this
enlarges
life
there
is
no
longer
any
death
to
those
who
understand
all
those
limitations
are
removed
it
is
no
more
than
going
into
another
room
all
are
together
in
the
hands
of
the
maggie
recognized
the
jetsam
of
christian
science
death
as
paul
says
is
thy
sting
o
grave
where
is
thy
victory
stapleton
flashed
a
radiant
look
of
helpfulness
round
the
faces
lingering
for
an
instant
on
laurie
and
leaned
back
there
followed
a
silence
shall
we
go
into
the
suggested
baxter
feebly
rising
the
guest
rose
too
again
with
a
brilliant
patient
smile
and
swept
out
maggie
crossed
herself
and
looked
at
laurie
the
boy
had
an
expression
half
of
disgust
half
of
interest
and
his
eyelids
sank
a
little
and
rose
again
then
maggie
went
out
after
the
others
ii
a
dreadful
woman
observed
baxter
half
an
hour
later
as
the
two
strolled
back
up
the
garden
path
after
seeing
stapleton
wave
a
delicately
gloved
hand
encouragingly
to
them
over
the
back
of
the
throbbing
motor
i
suppose
she
thinks
she
believes
it
all
said
maggie
my
dear
that
woman
would
believe
anything
i
hope
poor
laurie
was
not
too
much
distressed
oh
i
think
laurie
took
it
all
right
it
was
most
unfortunate
all
that
about
death
and
the
rest
why
here
comes
laurie
i
thought
he
would
be
gone
out
by
now
the
boy
strolled
towards
them
round
the
corner
of
the
house
tossing
away
the
fragment
of
his
cigarette
he
was
still
in
his
dark
suit
bareheaded
with
no
signs
of
riding
about
him
so
you
not
gone
out
yet
dear
boy
remarked
his
mother
not
yet
he
said
and
hesitated
as
they
went
on
baxter
noticed
it
i
go
and
get
ready
she
said
the
carriage
will
be
round
at
three
maggie
when
she
was
gone
the
two
moved
out
together
on
to
the
lawn
what
did
you
think
of
that
woman
demanded
laurie
with
a
detached
air
maggie
glanced
at
him
his
tone
was
a
little
too
much
detached
i
thought
her
quite
dreadful
she
said
frankly
did
you
she
added
oh
yes
i
suppose
so
said
laurie
he
drew
out
a
cigarette
and
lighted
it
you
know
a
lot
of
people
think
there
something
in
it
he
said
in
what
spiritualism
i
daresay
said
maggie
she
perceived
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
that
laurie
looked
at
her
suddenly
and
sharply
for
herself
she
loathed
what
little
she
knew
of
the
subject
so
cordially
and
completely
that
she
could
hardly
have
put
it
into
words
of
it
she
believed
to
be
fraud
a
matter
of
wigs
and
indian
muslin
and
and
the
other
tenth
by
the
most
generous
estimate
an
affair
of
the
dingiest
and
foulest
of
all
the
backstairs
of
life
the
prophetic
outpourings
of
stapleton
had
not
altered
her
opinion
oh
if
you
feel
like
that
went
on
laurie
she
turned
on
him
laurie
she
said
i
think
it
perfectly
detestable
i
acknowledge
i
do
know
much
about
it
but
what
little
i
do
know
is
enough
thank
you
laurie
smiled
in
a
faintly
patronizing
way
well
he
said
indulgently
if
you
think
that
it
not
much
use
discussing
it
indeed
it
not
said
maggie
with
her
nose
in
the
air
there
was
not
much
more
to
be
said
and
the
sounds
of
stamping
and
whoaing
in
the
presently
sent
the
girl
indoors
in
a
hurry
baxter
was
still
mildly
querulous
during
the
drive
it
appeared
to
her
maggie
perceived
a
kind
of
veiled
insult
that
things
should
be
talked
about
in
her
house
which
did
not
seem
to
fit
in
with
her
own
scheme
of
the
universe
baxter
knew
perfectly
well
that
every
soul
when
it
left
this
world
went
either
to
what
she
called
paradise
or
in
extremely
exceptional
cases
to
a
place
she
did
not
name
and
that
these
places
each
in
its
own
way
entirely
absorbed
the
attention
of
its
inhabitants
further
it
was
established
in
her
view
that
all
the
members
of
the
spiritual
world
apart
from
the
unhappy
ones
were
a
kind
of
anglicans
with
their
minds
no
doubt
enlarged
considerably
but
on
the
original
lines
tales
like
this
of
cardinal
newman
therefore
were
extremely
tiresome
and
upsetting
and
maggie
had
her
theology
also
to
her
also
it
appeared
quite
impossible
that
cardinal
newman
should
frequent
the
of
vincent
in
order
to
exchange
impressions
with
stapleton
but
she
was
more
elementary
in
her
answer
for
her
the
thing
was
simply
untrue
and
that
was
the
end
of
it
she
found
it
difficult
therefore
to
follow
her
companion
train
of
thought
what
was
it
she
said
demanded
baxter
presently
i
understand
her
ideas
about
materialism
i
think
she
called
it
materialization
explained
maggie
patiently
she
said
that
when
things
were
very
favorable
and
the
medium
a
very
good
one
the
soul
that
wanted
to
communicate
could
make
a
kind
of
body
for
itself
out
of
what
she
called
the
astral
matter
of
the
medium
or
the
sitters
but
surely
our
bodies
are
like
that
no
i
ca
say
that
i
think
they
are
but
that
what
she
said
my
dear
please
explain
i
want
to
understand
the
woman
maggie
frowned
a
little
well
the
first
thing
she
said
was
that
those
souls
want
to
communicate
and
that
they
begin
generally
by
things
like
or
making
blue
lights
then
when
you
know
there
they
can
go
further
sometimes
they
gain
control
of
the
medium
who
is
in
a
trance
and
speak
through
him
or
write
with
his
hand
then
if
things
are
favorable
they
begin
to
draw
out
this
matter
and
make
it
into
a
kind
of
body
for
themselves
very
thin
and
ethereal
so
that
you
can
pass
your
hand
through
it
then
as
things
get
better
and
better
they
go
further
still
and
can
make
this
body
so
solid
that
you
can
touch
it
only
this
is
sometimes
rather
dangerous
as
it
is
still
in
a
sort
of
way
connected
with
the
medium
i
think
that
the
idea
but
what
the
good
of
it
all
well
you
see
stapleton
thinks
that
they
really
are
souls
from
the
other
world
and
that
they
can
tell
us
all
kinds
of
things
about
it
all
and
what
true
and
so
on
but
you
do
believe
that
maggie
turned
her
large
eyes
on
the
old
lady
and
a
spark
of
humor
rose
and
glimmered
in
them
of
course
i
do
she
said
then
how
do
you
explain
it
i
think
it
probably
all
a
fraud
but
i
really
do
know
it
does
seem
to
me
to
matter
much
but
if
it
should
be
true
maggie
raised
her
eyebrows
smiling
dear
auntie
do
put
it
out
of
your
head
how
can
it
possibly
be
true
baxter
set
her
lips
in
as
much
severity
as
she
could
i
shall
ask
the
vicar
she
said
we
might
stop
at
the
vicarage
on
the
way
back
baxter
did
not
often
stop
at
the
vicarage
as
she
did
not
altogether
approve
of
the
vicar
wife
there
was
a
good
deal
of
pride
in
the
old
lady
and
it
seemed
to
her
occasionally
as
if
rymer
did
not
understand
the
difference
between
the
hall
and
the
parsonage
she
envied
sometimes
secretly
the
romanist
idea
of
celibacy
it
was
so
much
easier
to
get
on
with
your
spiritual
adviser
if
you
did
not
have
to
consider
his
wife
but
here
was
a
matter
which
a
clergyman
must
settle
for
her
once
and
for
all
so
she
put
on
a
slight
air
of
dignity
which
became
her
very
well
and
a
little
after
four
the
victoria
turned
up
the
steep
little
drive
that
led
to
the
vicarage
iii
thee
dusk
was
already
fallen
before
laurie
strolling
vaguely
in
the
garden
heard
the
carriage
wheels
draw
up
at
the
gate
outside
he
had
ridden
again
alone
and
his
mind
had
run
to
a
certain
extent
as
might
be
expected
upon
the
recent
guest
and
her
very
startling
conversation
he
was
an
intelligent
young
man
and
he
had
not
been
in
the
least
taken
in
by
her
remarks
yet
there
had
been
something
in
her
extreme
assurance
that
had
affected
him
as
a
man
may
smile
sourly
at
a
good
story
in
bad
taste
his
attitude
in
fact
was
that
of
most
christians
under
the
circumstances
he
did
not
for
an
instant
believe
that
such
things
really
and
literally
happened
and
yet
it
was
difficult
to
advance
any
absolutely
conclusive
argument
against
them
merely
they
had
not
come
his
way
they
appeared
to
conflict
with
experience
and
they
usually
found
as
their
advocates
such
persons
as
stapleton
two
things
however
prevailed
to
keep
the
matter
before
his
mind
the
first
was
his
own
sense
of
loss
his
own
experience
sore
and
hot
within
him
of
the
unapproachable
emptiness
of
death
the
second
maggie
attitude
when
a
plainly
sensible
and
controlled
young
woman
takes
up
a
position
of
superiority
she
is
apt
unless
the
young
man
in
her
company
happens
to
be
in
love
with
her
and
sometimes
even
when
he
is
to
provoke
and
irritate
him
into
a
camp
of
opposition
she
is
still
more
apt
to
do
so
if
her
relations
to
him
have
once
been
in
the
line
of
even
greater
tenderness
laurie
then
was
not
in
the
most
favorable
of
moods
to
receive
the
dicta
of
the
vicar
they
were
announced
to
him
immediately
after
baxter
had
received
from
maggie
hands
her
first
cup
of
tea
rymer
tells
me
it
all
nonsense
she
said
laurie
looked
up
what
he
said
rymer
tells
me
spiritualism
is
all
nonsense
he
told
me
about
someone
called
eglingham
who
kept
a
beard
in
his
portmanteau
eglinton
i
think
auntie
put
in
maggie
i
daresay
my
dear
anyhow
it
all
the
same
i
felt
sure
it
must
be
so
laurie
took
a
bun
with
a
thoughtful
air
does
rymer
know
very
much
about
it
do
you
think
mother
dear
boy
i
think
he
knows
all
that
anyone
need
know
besides
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
how
could
cardinal
newman
possibly
appear
in
a
particularly
when
stapleton
says
he
is
a
christian
any
longer
this
had
a
possible
and
rather
pleasing
double
interpretation
but
laurie
decided
it
was
not
worth
while
to
be
humorous
what
about
the
witch
of
endor
he
asked
innocently
instead
that
was
in
the
old
testament
answered
his
mother
rapidly
rymer
said
something
about
that
too
oh
was
it
really
samuel
who
appeared
rymer
thinks
that
things
were
permitted
then
that
are
not
permitted
now
laurie
drank
up
his
cup
of
tea
it
is
a
humiliating
fact
that
extreme
grief
often
renders
the
mourner
rather
cross
there
was
a
distinct
air
of
crossness
about
laurie
at
this
moment
his
nerves
were
very
near
the
top
well
that
very
convenient
he
said
maggie
do
you
know
if
there
any
book
on
spiritualism
in
the
house
the
girl
glanced
uneasily
near
the
i
do
know
she
said
yes
i
think
there
something
up
there
i
believe
i
saw
it
the
other
day
laurie
rose
and
stood
opposite
the
shelves
what
color
is
it
no
no
more
tea
thanks
er
black
and
red
i
think
said
the
girl
i
forget
she
looked
up
at
him
faintly
uneasy
as
he
very
deliberately
drew
down
a
book
from
the
shelf
and
turned
the
pages
yes
this
is
it
he
said
thanks
very
much
no
really
no
more
tea
thanks
mother
then
he
went
to
the
door
with
his
easy
rather
long
steps
and
disappeared
they
heard
his
steps
in
the
inner
hall
then
a
door
closed
overhead
baxter
contentedly
poured
herself
out
another
cup
of
tea
poor
boy
she
said
he
thinking
of
that
girl
still
i
glad
got
something
to
occupy
his
mind
the
end
room
on
the
first
floor
was
laurie
possession
it
was
a
big
place
with
two
windows
and
a
large
open
fire
and
he
had
skillfully
masked
the
fact
that
it
was
a
bedroom
by
disposing
his
furniture
with
the
help
of
a
screen
in
such
a
manner
as
completely
to
hide
the
bed
and
the
washing
arrangements
the
rest
of
the
room
he
had
furnished
in
a
pleasing
male
kind
of
fashion
with
a
big
couch
drawn
across
the
fire
a
and
chairs
a
deep
easy
chair
near
the
door
and
a
long
high
bookcase
covering
the
wall
between
the
door
and
the
windows
his
college
oar
too
hung
here
and
there
were
pleasant
groups
and
pictures
scattered
on
the
other
walls
maggie
did
not
often
come
in
here
except
by
invitation
but
about
seven
on
this
evening
half
an
hour
before
she
had
to
go
and
dress
she
thought
she
would
look
in
on
him
for
a
few
minutes
she
was
still
a
little
uncomfortable
she
did
not
quite
know
why
it
was
too
ridiculous
she
told
herself
that
a
sensible
boy
like
laurie
could
be
seriously
affected
by
what
she
considered
the
wicked
nonsense
of
spiritualism
yet
she
went
telling
herself
that
laurie
grief
was
an
excuse
for
showing
him
a
little
marked
friendliness
besides
she
would
like
to
ask
him
whether
he
was
really
going
back
to
town
on
thursday
she
tapped
twice
before
an
answer
came
and
then
it
seemed
a
rather
breathless
voice
which
spoke
the
boy
was
sitting
bolt
upright
on
the
edge
of
the
sofa
with
a
couple
of
candles
at
his
side
and
the
book
in
his
hands
there
was
a
strained
and
intensely
interested
look
in
his
eyes
may
i
come
in
for
a
few
minutes
it
nearly
dressing
time
she
said
oh
er
certainly
he
got
up
rather
stiffly
still
keeping
his
place
in
the
book
with
one
finger
while
she
sat
down
then
he
too
sat
again
and
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
why
you
not
smoking
she
said
i
forgot
i
will
now
if
you
do
mind
she
saw
his
fingers
tremble
a
little
as
he
put
out
his
hand
to
a
box
of
cigarettes
at
his
side
but
he
put
the
book
down
after
looking
at
the
page
she
could
keep
her
question
in
no
longer
what
do
you
think
of
that
she
said
nodding
at
the
book
he
filled
his
lungs
with
smoke
and
exhaled
again
slowly
i
think
it
extraordinary
he
said
shortly
in
what
way
again
he
paused
before
answering
then
he
answered
deliberately
if
human
evidence
is
worth
anything
those
things
happen
he
said
what
things
the
dead
return
maggie
looked
at
him
aware
of
his
deliberate
attempt
at
dramatic
brevity
he
was
watching
the
end
of
his
cigarette
with
elaborate
attention
and
his
face
had
that
white
rather
determined
look
that
she
had
seen
on
it
once
or
twice
before
in
the
presence
of
a
domestic
crisis
do
you
really
mean
you
believe
that
she
said
with
a
touch
of
careful
bitterness
in
her
voice
i
do
he
said
or
else
well
or
else
human
evidence
is
worth
nothing
at
all
maggie
understood
him
perfectly
but
she
realized
that
this
was
not
an
occasion
to
force
issues
she
still
put
the
tone
of
faint
irony
into
her
voice
you
really
believe
that
cardinal
newman
comes
to
drawing
room
and
raps
on
tables
i
really
believe
that
it
is
possible
to
get
into
touch
with
those
whom
we
call
dead
each
instance
of
course
depends
on
its
own
evidence
and
cardinal
newman
i
have
not
studied
the
evidence
for
cardinal
newman
remarked
laurie
in
a
let
have
a
look
at
that
book
said
maggie
impulsively
he
handed
it
to
her
and
she
began
to
turn
the
pages
pausing
now
and
again
to
read
a
particular
paragraph
and
once
for
nearly
a
minute
while
she
examined
an
illustration
certainly
the
book
seemed
interestingly
written
and
she
read
an
argument
or
two
that
appeared
reasonably
presented
yet
she
was
extraordinarily
repelled
even
by
the
dead
paper
and
ink
she
had
in
her
hands
it
was
as
if
it
was
something
obscene
finally
she
tossed
it
back
on
to
the
couch
laurie
waited
but
she
said
nothing
well
he
asked
at
last
still
refraining
from
looking
at
her
i
think
it
horrible
she
said
laurie
delicately
adjusted
a
little
tobacco
protruding
from
his
cigarette
is
that
a
little
unreasonable
he
asked
you
hardly
looked
at
it
yet
maggie
knew
this
mood
of
his
only
too
well
he
reserved
it
for
occasions
when
he
was
determined
to
fight
argument
was
a
useless
weapon
against
it
my
dear
boy
she
said
with
an
effort
i
sorry
i
daresay
it
is
unreasonable
but
that
kind
of
thing
does
seem
to
me
so
disgusting
that
all
i
did
come
to
talk
about
that
tell
me
did
you
said
laurie
maggie
was
silent
did
you
well
yes
i
did
but
i
do
want
to
any
more
laurie
smiled
so
that
it
might
be
seen
well
what
else
did
you
want
to
say
he
glanced
purposely
at
the
book
maggie
ignored
his
glance
i
just
came
to
see
how
you
were
getting
on
how
do
you
mean
with
the
book
no
in
every
way
he
looked
up
at
her
swiftly
and
suddenly
and
she
saw
that
his
agony
of
sorrow
was
acute
beneath
all
his
attempts
at
superiority
his
courteous
fractiousness
and
his
set
face
she
was
filled
suddenly
with
an
enormous
pity
oh
laurie
i
so
sorry
she
cried
out
ca
i
do
anything
nothing
thanks
nothing
at
all
he
said
quietly
again
pity
and
misery
surged
up
within
her
and
she
cast
all
prudence
to
the
winds
she
had
not
realized
how
fond
she
was
of
this
boy
till
she
saw
once
more
that
look
in
his
eyes
oh
laurie
you
know
i
did
like
it
but
but
i
do
know
what
to
do
i
so
sorry
but
do
spoil
it
all
she
said
wildly
hardly
knowing
what
she
feared
i
beg
your
pardon
you
know
what
i
mean
do
spoil
it
by
by
fancying
things
maggie
said
the
boy
quietly
you
must
let
me
alone
you
help
ca
i
you
ca
help
he
repeated
i
must
go
my
own
way
please
do
say
any
more
i
ca
stand
it
there
followed
a
dead
silence
then
maggie
recovered
and
stood
up
he
rose
with
her
forgive
me
laurie
wo
you
i
must
say
this
you
remember
always
do
anything
i
can
wo
you
then
she
was
gone
iv
the
ladies
went
to
bed
early
at
stantons
at
ten
precisely
a
clinking
of
bedroom
candlesticks
was
heard
in
the
hall
followed
by
the
sound
of
locking
doors
this
was
the
signal
baxter
laid
aside
her
embroidery
with
the
punctuality
of
a
religious
at
the
sound
of
a
bell
and
said
two
words
my
dears
there
were
occasionally
exclamatory
expostulations
from
the
two
at
the
but
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
the
game
had
been
designed
with
an
eye
upon
the
clock
and
hardly
any
delay
followed
baxter
kissed
her
son
and
passed
her
arm
through
maggie
laurie
followed
gave
them
candles
and
generally
took
one
himself
but
this
evening
there
was
no
piquet
laurie
had
stayed
later
than
usual
in
the
and
had
wandered
rather
restlessly
about
when
he
had
joined
the
others
he
looked
at
a
london
evening
paper
for
a
little
paced
about
vanished
again
and
only
returned
as
the
ladies
were
making
ready
to
depart
then
he
gave
them
their
candlesticks
and
himself
came
back
to
the
drawing
room
he
was
in
fact
in
a
far
more
perturbed
and
excited
mood
than
even
maggie
had
had
any
idea
of
she
had
interrupted
him
through
the
book
but
he
had
read
again
steadily
until
five
minutes
before
dinner
and
had
indeed
gone
back
again
to
finish
it
afterwards
he
had
now
finished
it
and
he
wanted
to
think
it
had
had
a
surprising
effect
on
him
coming
as
it
did
upon
a
state
of
mind
intensely
stirred
to
its
depths
by
his
sorrow
crossness
as
i
have
said
had
been
the
natural
psychological
result
of
his
emotions
but
his
emotions
were
none
the
less
real
the
froth
of
whipped
cream
is
real
cream
after
all
now
laurie
had
seen
perfectly
well
the
extreme
unconvincingness
of
stapleton
and
had
been
genuine
enough
in
his
little
shrug
of
disapproval
in
answer
to
maggie
after
lunch
yet
that
remarks
had
been
sufficient
just
to
ignite
the
train
of
thought
this
train
had
smoldered
in
the
afternoon
had
been
fanned
ever
so
slightly
by
two
breezes
the
sense
of
maggie
superiority
and
the
faint
rebellious
reaction
which
had
come
upon
him
with
regard
to
his
personal
religion
certainly
he
had
had
mass
said
for
amy
this
morning
but
it
had
been
by
almost
a
superstitious
rather
than
a
religious
instinct
he
was
in
fact
in
that
state
of
religious
unreality
which
occasionally
comes
upon
converts
within
a
year
or
two
of
the
change
of
their
faith
the
impetus
of
old
association
is
absent
and
the
force
of
novelty
has
died
underneath
all
this
then
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
one
thing
that
was
intensely
real
to
him
was
his
sense
of
loss
of
the
one
soul
in
whom
his
own
had
been
wrapped
up
even
this
afternoon
as
yesterday
even
this
morning
as
he
lay
awake
he
had
been
conscious
of
an
irresistible
impulse
to
demand
some
sign
to
catch
some
glimpse
of
that
which
was
now
denied
to
him
it
was
in
this
mood
that
he
had
read
the
book
and
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
he
had
been
excited
by
it
for
it
opened
up
to
him
beneath
all
its
sham
mysticism
its
intolerable
affectations
its
grotesque
parody
of
spirituality
of
all
of
which
he
was
largely
aware
a
glimmering
avenue
of
a
faintly
possible
hope
of
which
he
had
never
dreamed
a
hope
at
least
of
that
half
which
is
so
tempting
to
certain
characters
here
in
this
book
written
by
a
living
man
whose
name
and
address
were
given
were
stories
so
startling
and
theories
so
apparently
consonant
with
themselves
and
with
other
partly
known
facts
stories
and
theories
too
which
met
so
precisely
his
own
overmastering
desire
that
it
is
little
wonder
that
he
was
affected
by
them
naturally
even
during
his
reading
a
thousand
answers
and
adverse
comments
had
sprung
to
his
mind
suggestions
of
fraud
of
lying
of
hallucination
but
yet
here
the
possibility
remained
here
were
living
men
and
women
who
with
the
usual
complement
of
senses
and
reason
declared
categorically
and
in
detail
that
on
this
and
that
date
in
this
place
and
the
other
after
having
taken
all
possible
precautions
against
fraud
they
had
received
messages
from
the
dead
messages
of
which
the
purport
was
understood
by
none
but
themselves
that
they
had
seen
with
their
eyes
in
sufficient
light
the
actual
features
of
the
dead
whom
they
loved
that
they
had
even
clasped
their
hands
and
held
for
an
instant
the
bodies
of
those
whom
they
had
seen
die
with
their
own
eyes
and
buried
when
the
ladies
footsteps
had
ceased
to
sound
overhead
laurie
went
to
the
french
window
opened
it
and
passed
on
to
the
lawn
he
was
astonished
at
the
warmth
of
the
september
night
the
little
wind
that
had
been
chilly
this
afternoon
had
dropped
with
the
coming
of
the
dark
and
high
overhead
he
could
see
the
great
masses
of
the
leaves
motionless
against
the
sky
he
passed
round
the
house
and
beneath
the
yews
and
sat
down
on
the
garden
bench
it
was
darker
here
than
outside
on
the
lawn
beneath
his
feet
were
the
soft
needles
from
the
trees
and
above
him
as
he
looked
out
still
sunk
in
his
thought
he
could
see
the
glimmer
of
a
star
or
two
between
the
branches
it
was
a
fragrant
kindly
night
from
the
hamlet
of
half
a
dozen
houses
beyond
the
garden
came
no
sound
and
the
house
too
was
still
behind
him
an
illuminated
window
somewhere
on
the
first
floor
went
out
as
he
looked
at
it
like
a
soul
leaving
a
body
once
a
sleepy
bird
somewhere
in
the
shrubbery
chirped
to
its
mate
and
was
silent
again
then
as
he
still
labored
in
argument
putting
this
against
that
and
weighing
that
against
the
other
his
emotion
rose
up
in
an
irresistible
torrent
and
all
consideration
ceased
one
thing
remained
he
must
have
amy
or
he
must
die
it
was
five
or
six
minutes
before
he
moved
again
from
that
attitude
of
clenched
hands
and
tensely
strung
muscles
into
which
his
sudden
passion
had
cast
him
during
those
minutes
he
had
willed
with
his
whole
power
that
she
should
come
to
him
now
and
here
down
in
this
warm
and
fragrant
darkness
hidden
from
all
eyes
in
this
sweet
silence
round
which
sleep
kept
its
guard
such
things
had
happened
before
such
things
must
have
happened
for
the
will
and
the
love
of
man
are
the
mightiest
forces
in
creation
surely
again
and
again
it
had
happened
there
must
be
somewhere
in
the
world
man
after
man
who
had
so
called
back
the
dead
a
husband
sobbing
silently
in
the
dark
a
child
wailing
for
his
mother
surely
that
force
had
before
in
the
world
history
willed
back
again
from
the
mysterious
dark
of
space
the
dear
personality
that
was
all
that
even
heaven
could
give
had
even
compelled
into
a
semblance
of
life
some
sort
of
body
to
clothe
it
in
these
things
must
have
happened
only
secrets
had
been
well
kept
so
this
boy
had
willed
it
yet
the
dark
had
remained
empty
and
no
shadow
no
faintly
outlined
face
had
even
for
an
instant
blotted
out
the
star
on
which
he
stared
no
touch
on
his
shoulder
no
whisper
in
his
ear
it
had
seemed
as
he
strove
there
in
the
silence
that
it
must
be
done
that
there
was
no
limit
to
power
concentrated
and
intense
yet
it
had
not
happened
once
he
had
shuddered
a
little
and
the
very
shudder
of
fear
had
had
in
it
a
touch
of
delicious
trembling
expectation
yet
it
had
not
happened
laurie
relaxed
his
muscles
therefore
let
his
breath
exhale
in
a
long
sigh
and
once
more
remembered
the
book
he
had
read
and
stapleton
feverish
thought
half
an
hour
later
his
mother
listening
in
her
bed
heard
his
footsteps
pass
her
room
i
lady
laura
bethell
spinster
had
just
returned
to
her
house
in
queen
gate
with
her
dearest
friend
stapleton
for
a
few
days
of
psychical
orgy
it
was
in
her
house
as
much
as
in
any
in
london
that
the
modern
prophets
were
to
be
met
with
women
in
shapeless
dresses
little
men
and
big
with
long
hair
and
cloaks
and
it
was
in
her
that
tea
and
queen
cakes
were
dispensed
to
inquirers
and
papers
read
and
discussed
when
the
revels
were
over
lady
laura
herself
was
not
yet
completely
emancipated
from
what
her
friends
sometimes
called
the
of
revelation
to
her
it
seemed
a
profound
truth
that
things
could
be
true
and
untrue
simultaneously
that
what
might
be
facts
on
this
side
as
she
would
have
expressed
it
might
be
falsehoods
on
the
other
she
was
accustomed
therefore
to
attend
all
saints
carlton
gardens
in
the
morning
and
psychical
or
halls
in
the
evening
and
to
declare
to
her
friends
how
beautifully
the
one
aspect
illuminated
and
interpreted
the
other
for
the
rest
she
was
a
small
woman
with
penciled
dark
eyebrows
a
small
aquiline
nose
gold
and
an
exquisite
taste
in
dress
the
two
were
seated
this
tuesday
evening
a
week
after
stapleton
visit
to
the
stantons
in
the
of
the
queen
gate
house
over
the
remnants
of
what
corresponded
to
tea
i
say
corresponded
since
both
of
them
were
sufficiently
advanced
to
have
renounced
actual
tea
altogether
stapleton
partook
of
a
little
hot
water
out
of
a
jug
her
hostess
of
boiled
milk
they
shared
their
plasmon
biscuits
together
these
things
were
considered
important
for
those
who
would
successfully
find
the
higher
light
at
this
instant
they
were
discussing
vincent
dearest
he
seems
to
me
so
different
from
the
others
mewed
lady
laura
he
is
such
a
man
you
know
so
often
those
others
are
not
quite
like
men
at
all
they
wear
such
funny
clothes
and
their
hair
always
is
so
queer
somehow
darling
i
know
what
you
mean
yes
there
a
great
deal
of
that
about
james
vincent
even
dear
tom
was
almost
polite
to
him
he
could
bear
the
others
he
said
that
he
always
thought
they
were
going
to
paw
him
and
then
his
powers
continued
lady
laura
his
powers
always
seem
to
me
so
much
greater
the
magnetism
is
so
much
more
evident
stapleton
finished
her
hot
water
we
are
going
on
sunday
she
said
questioningly
yes
just
a
small
party
and
he
comes
here
tomorrow
you
remember
just
for
a
talk
i
have
asked
a
clergyman
i
know
in
to
meet
him
it
seems
to
me
such
a
pity
that
our
religious
teachers
should
know
so
little
of
what
is
going
on
who
is
he
oh
jamieson
just
a
young
clergyman
i
met
in
the
summer
i
promised
to
let
him
know
the
next
time
vincent
came
to
me
stapleton
murmured
her
gratification
these
two
had
really
a
great
deal
in
common
besides
their
faith
it
is
true
that
stapleton
was
forty
and
her
friend
but
but
the
former
did
all
that
was
possible
to
compensate
for
this
by
adroit
toilette
tactics
both
too
were
accustomed
to
dress
in
soft
materials
with
long
chains
bearing
various
emblems
they
did
their
hair
in
the
same
way
they
cultivated
the
same
kinds
of
tones
in
their
voices
a
purring
mewing
manner
suggestive
of
intuitive
kittens
both
alike
had
a
passion
for
proselytism
but
after
that
the
differences
began
there
was
a
deal
more
in
stapleton
besides
the
kittenish
qualities
she
was
perfectly
capable
of
delivering
a
speech
in
public
she
had
written
some
really
articles
in
various
higher
periodicals
and
she
had
a
beyond
the
ordinary
at
the
point
where
lady
laura
began
to
deprecate
and
soothe
stapleton
began
to
clear
decks
for
action
so
to
speak
to
be
incisive
to
be
fervent
even
to
be
rather
eloquent
she
kept
dear
tom
the
colonel
not
crushed
or
beaten
for
that
was
beyond
the
power
of
man
to
do
but
at
least
silently
acquiescent
in
her
program
he
allowed
her
even
to
entertain
her
prophetical
friends
at
his
expense
now
and
then
and
even
when
among
men
refrained
from
too
bitter
speech
it
was
said
by
the
colonel
friends
that
mrs
colonel
had
a
tongue
of
her
own
certainly
she
ruled
her
house
well
and
did
her
duty
and
it
was
only
because
of
her
husband
absence
in
scotland
that
during
this
time
she
was
permitting
herself
the
refreshment
of
a
week
or
two
among
the
illuminated
at
about
six
lady
laura
announced
her
intention
of
retiring
for
her
evening
meditation
opening
out
of
her
bedroom
was
a
small
that
she
had
fitted
up
for
this
purpose
with
all
the
broad
suggestiveness
that
marks
the
higher
thought
decked
with
ornaments
emblematical
of
at
least
three
religions
and
provided
with
a
faldstool
and
an
exceedingly
easy
chair
it
was
here
that
she
was
accustomed
to
spend
an
hour
before
dinner
with
closed
eyes
emancipating
herself
from
the
fetters
of
sense
and
rising
to
a
due
appreciation
of
that
nothingness
that
was
all
from
which
all
came
and
to
which
it
retired
i
must
go
dearest
it
is
time
a
ring
at
the
bell
below
made
her
pause
do
you
think
that
can
be
mr
vincent
she
said
pleasantly
apprehensive
it
not
the
right
day
but
one
never
knows
a
footman
figure
entered
baxter
my
lady
is
your
ladyship
at
home
baxter
stapleton
rose
let
me
see
him
instead
dearest
you
remember
from
stantons
i
wonder
what
he
wants
murmured
the
hostess
yes
do
see
him
maud
you
can
always
fetch
me
if
it
anything
then
she
was
gone
stapleton
sank
into
a
chair
again
and
in
a
minute
laurie
was
shaking
hands
with
her
stapleton
was
accustomed
to
deal
with
young
men
and
through
long
habit
had
learned
how
to
flatter
them
without
appearing
to
do
so
laurie
type
however
was
less
familiar
to
her
she
preferred
the
kind
that
grow
their
hair
rather
long
and
wear
collars
and
have
just
found
out
the
hopeless
banality
of
all
orthodoxy
whatever
she
even
bore
with
them
when
they
called
themselves
unmoral
but
she
remembered
laurie
the
silent
boy
at
lunch
last
week
she
had
even
mentioned
him
to
lady
laura
and
received
information
about
the
village
girl
more
or
less
correct
she
was
also
aware
that
he
was
a
catholic
she
gave
him
her
hand
without
rising
lady
laura
asked
me
to
excuse
her
absence
to
you
baxter
to
be
quite
truthful
she
is
at
home
but
had
just
gone
upstairs
for
her
meditation
indeed
yes
you
know
we
think
that
so
important
just
as
you
do
do
sit
down
baxter
you
have
had
tea
yes
thanks
i
hope
she
will
be
down
before
you
go
i
do
think
she
be
very
long
this
evening
can
i
give
her
any
message
baxter
in
case
you
do
see
her
laurie
put
his
hat
and
stick
down
carefully
and
crossed
his
legs
no
i
do
think
so
thanks
he
said
the
fact
is
i
came
partly
to
find
out
your
address
if
i
might
stapleton
rustled
and
rearranged
herself
oh
but
that
charming
of
you
she
said
is
there
anything
particular
yes
said
laurie
slowly
at
least
it
seems
rather
particular
to
me
it
what
you
were
talking
about
the
other
day
now
how
nice
of
you
to
say
that
do
you
know
i
was
wondering
as
we
talked
now
do
tell
me
exactly
what
is
in
your
mind
mr
baxter
stapleton
was
conscious
of
a
considerable
sense
of
pleasure
usually
she
found
this
kind
of
man
very
imperceptive
and
gross
laurie
seemed
perfectly
at
his
ease
dressed
quite
in
the
proper
way
and
had
an
air
of
presentableness
that
usually
only
went
with
philistinism
she
determined
to
do
her
best
may
i
speak
quite
freely
please
he
asked
looking
straight
at
her
please
please
she
said
with
that
touch
of
childish
intensity
that
her
friends
thought
so
innocent
and
beautiful
well
it
like
this
said
laurie
i
always
rather
disliked
all
that
kind
of
thing
more
than
i
can
say
it
did
seem
to
me
so
well
so
feeble
do
you
know
and
then
i
a
catholic
you
see
and
so
yes
yes
well
i
been
reading
stainton
moses
and
one
or
two
other
books
and
i
must
say
that
an
awful
lot
of
it
seems
to
me
still
great
rubbish
and
then
there
are
any
amount
of
frauds
are
there
stapleton
in
that
line
alas
ah
yes
but
then
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
some
of
the
evidence
that
remains
it
seems
to
me
that
if
evidence
is
worth
anything
at
all
there
must
be
something
real
at
the
back
of
it
all
and
then
if
that
is
so
if
it
really
is
true
that
it
is
possible
to
get
into
actual
touch
with
people
who
are
dead
i
mean
really
and
truly
so
that
there
no
kind
of
doubt
about
it
well
that
does
seem
to
me
about
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
do
you
see
she
kept
her
eyes
on
his
face
for
an
instant
or
two
plainly
he
was
really
moved
his
face
had
gone
a
little
white
in
the
lamplight
and
his
hands
were
clasped
tightly
enough
over
his
knee
to
whiten
the
knuckles
she
remembered
lady
laura
remarks
about
the
village
girl
and
understood
but
she
perceived
that
she
must
not
attempt
intimacy
just
yet
with
this
young
man
he
would
resent
it
besides
she
was
shrewd
enough
to
see
by
his
manner
that
he
did
not
altogether
like
her
she
nodded
pensively
once
or
twice
then
she
turned
to
him
with
a
bright
smile
i
understand
entirely
she
said
may
i
too
speak
quite
freely
yes
well
i
am
so
glad
you
have
spoken
out
of
course
we
are
quite
accustomed
to
being
distrusted
and
feared
after
all
it
is
the
privilege
of
all
to
suffer
is
it
not
well
i
will
say
what
is
in
my
heart
first
you
are
quite
right
about
some
of
our
workers
being
dishonest
sometimes
they
are
baxter
i
have
seen
more
than
one
myself
exposed
but
that
is
natural
is
it
not
why
there
have
been
bad
catholics
too
have
there
not
and
after
all
we
are
only
human
and
there
is
a
great
temptation
sometimes
not
to
send
people
away
disappointed
you
have
heard
those
stories
i
expect
mr
baxter
i
have
heard
of
mr
eglinton
ah
poor
willie
yes
but
he
had
great
powers
for
all
that
well
but
the
point
you
want
to
get
at
is
this
is
it
not
is
it
really
true
underneath
it
all
is
that
it
laurie
nodded
looking
at
her
steadily
she
leaned
forward
baxter
by
all
that
i
hold
most
sacred
i
assure
you
that
it
is
that
i
myself
have
seen
and
touched
my
own
father
who
crossed
over
twenty
years
ago
i
have
received
messages
from
his
own
lips
and
communications
in
other
ways
too
concerning
matters
only
known
to
him
and
to
myself
is
that
sufficient
no
she
held
up
a
delicate
silencing
hand
no
i
will
not
ask
you
to
take
my
word
i
will
ask
you
to
test
it
for
yourself
laurie
too
leaned
forward
now
in
his
low
chair
his
hands
clasped
between
his
knees
you
will
you
will
let
me
test
it
he
said
in
a
low
voice
she
sat
back
easily
pushing
her
draperies
straight
she
was
in
some
fine
silk
that
fell
straight
from
her
high
slender
waist
to
her
shoes
listen
baxter
tomorrow
there
is
coming
to
this
house
certainly
the
greatest
medium
in
london
if
not
in
europe
of
course
we
can
not
compete
with
the
east
we
are
only
children
beside
them
well
this
man
vincent
i
think
i
spoke
of
him
to
you
last
week
he
is
coming
here
just
for
a
talk
to
one
or
two
friends
there
shall
be
no
difficulty
if
you
wish
it
i
will
speak
to
lady
laura
before
you
go
laurie
looked
at
her
without
moving
i
shall
be
very
much
obliged
he
said
you
will
remember
that
i
am
not
yet
in
the
least
convinced
i
only
want
to
know
that
is
exactly
the
right
attitude
that
is
all
we
have
any
right
to
ask
we
do
not
ask
for
blind
faith
baxter
only
for
believing
after
having
seen
laurie
nodded
slowly
that
seems
to
me
reasonable
he
said
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
then
she
determined
on
a
bold
stroke
there
is
someone
in
particular
baxter
forgive
me
for
asking
someone
who
has
passed
over
she
sank
her
voice
to
what
she
had
been
informed
was
a
sympathetic
tone
and
was
scarcely
prepared
for
the
sudden
tightening
of
that
face
that
is
my
affair
mrs
stapleton
ah
well
she
had
been
premature
she
would
fetch
lady
laura
she
said
she
thought
she
might
venture
for
such
a
purpose
no
she
would
not
be
away
three
minutes
then
she
rustled
out
laurie
went
to
the
fire
to
wait
and
stood
there
mechanically
warming
his
hands
and
staring
down
at
that
sleeping
core
of
red
coal
he
had
taken
his
courage
in
both
hands
in
coming
at
all
in
spite
of
his
brave
words
to
maggie
he
had
been
conscious
of
a
curious
repulsion
with
regard
to
the
whole
matter
a
repulsion
not
only
of
contempt
towards
the
elaborate
affectations
of
the
woman
he
had
determined
to
consult
yet
he
had
come
what
he
had
said
just
now
had
been
perfectly
true
he
was
not
yet
in
the
least
convinced
but
he
was
anxious
intensely
and
passionately
anxious
goaded
too
by
desire
ah
surely
it
was
absurd
and
fantastic
here
in
london
in
this
century
he
turned
and
faced
the
room
letting
his
eyes
wander
round
the
walls
the
blue
stamped
paper
the
empire
furniture
the
general
appearance
of
beautiful
comfort
and
sane
modern
life
it
was
absurd
and
fantastic
he
would
be
disappointed
again
as
he
had
been
disappointed
in
everything
else
these
things
did
not
happen
the
dead
did
not
return
step
by
step
those
things
that
for
centuries
had
been
deemed
evidence
of
the
supernatural
one
by
one
had
been
explained
and
discounted
hypnotism
water
divining
witchcraft
and
the
rest
all
these
had
once
been
believed
to
be
indisputable
proofs
of
a
life
beyond
the
grave
of
strange
supernormal
personalities
and
these
one
by
one
had
been
either
accounted
for
or
discredited
it
was
mad
of
him
to
be
alarmed
or
excited
no
he
would
go
through
with
it
expecting
nothing
hoping
nothing
but
he
would
just
go
through
with
it
to
satisfy
himself
the
door
opened
and
the
two
ladies
came
in
i
am
delighted
that
you
called
baxter
and
on
such
an
errand
lady
laura
put
out
a
hand
tremulous
with
pleasure
at
welcoming
a
possible
disciple
stapleton
has
explained
began
laurie
i
understand
everything
you
come
as
a
skeptic
no
not
as
a
skeptic
but
as
an
inquirer
that
is
all
that
we
wish
then
tomorrow
at
about
four
i
it
was
a
mellow
october
afternoon
glowing
towards
sunset
as
laurie
came
across
the
south
end
of
the
park
to
his
appointment
next
day
and
the
effect
of
it
upon
his
mind
was
singularly
unsuggestive
of
supernatural
mystery
instead
the
warm
sky
the
lights
beginning
to
peep
here
and
there
though
an
hour
before
sunset
turned
him
rather
in
the
direction
of
the
natural
and
the
domestic
he
wondered
what
his
mother
and
maggie
would
say
if
they
knew
his
errand
for
he
had
sufficient
not
to
have
told
them
of
his
intentions
as
regards
his
mother
he
did
not
care
very
much
of
course
she
would
deprecate
it
and
feebly
dissuade
but
he
recognized
that
there
was
no
particular
principle
behind
beyond
a
sense
of
discomfort
at
the
unknown
but
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
argue
with
himself
about
maggie
the
angry
kind
of
contempt
that
he
knew
she
would
feel
needed
an
answer
and
he
gave
it
by
reminding
himself
that
she
had
been
brought
up
in
a
that
she
knew
nothing
of
the
world
and
that
lastly
he
himself
did
not
take
the
matter
seriously
he
was
aware
too
that
the
instinctive
repulsion
that
she
felt
so
keenly
found
a
certain
echo
in
his
own
feelings
but
he
explained
this
by
the
novelty
of
the
thing
in
fact
the
attitude
of
mind
in
which
he
more
or
less
succeeded
in
arraying
himself
was
that
of
one
who
goes
to
see
a
serious
conjurer
it
would
be
rather
fun
he
thought
to
see
a
table
dancing
but
there
was
not
wholly
wanting
that
inexplicable
tendency
of
some
natures
deliberately
to
deceive
themselves
on
what
lies
nearest
to
their
hearts
vincent
had
not
yet
arrived
when
he
was
shown
upstairs
even
though
laurie
himself
was
late
this
was
partly
deliberate
he
thought
it
best
to
show
a
little
nonchalance
there
was
only
a
young
clergyman
in
the
room
with
the
ladies
and
the
two
were
introduced
baxter
mr
jamieson
he
seemed
a
harmless
young
man
thought
laurie
and
plainly
a
little
nervous
at
the
situation
in
which
he
found
himself
as
might
a
greyhound
carry
himself
in
a
kennel
of
foxhounds
he
was
very
correctly
dressed
with
roman
collar
and
stock
and
obviously
had
not
long
left
a
theological
college
he
had
an
engaging
kind
of
courtesy
ecclesiastically
cut
features
and
curly
black
hair
he
sat
balancing
a
delicate
cup
adroitly
on
his
knee
jamieson
is
so
anxious
to
know
all
that
is
going
on
explained
lady
laura
with
a
voluble
frankness
he
thinks
it
so
necessary
to
be
abreast
of
the
times
as
he
said
to
me
the
other
day
laurie
assented
grimly
pitying
the
young
man
for
his
indiscreet
confidences
the
clergyman
looked
priggish
in
his
efforts
not
to
do
so
he
has
a
class
of
young
men
on
sundays
continued
the
hostess
another
biscuit
maud
darling
whom
he
tries
to
interest
in
all
modern
movements
he
thinks
it
so
important
jamieson
cleared
his
throat
in
a
virile
manner
just
so
he
said
exactly
so
and
so
i
told
him
he
must
really
come
and
meet
vincent
i
ca
think
why
he
is
so
late
but
he
has
so
many
calls
upon
his
time
that
i
am
sure
i
wonder
vincent
announced
the
footman
a
rather
fine
figure
of
a
man
came
forward
into
the
room
dressed
in
much
better
taste
than
laurie
somehow
had
expected
and
not
at
all
like
the
type
of
an
insane
dissenting
minister
in
broadcloth
which
he
had
feared
instead
it
was
a
big
man
that
he
saw
stooping
a
little
inclined
to
stoutness
with
a
full
curly
beard
tinged
with
grey
rather
overhung
brows
and
a
high
forehead
from
which
the
same
kind
of
curly
greyish
hair
was
beginning
to
retreat
he
was
in
a
and
dark
trousers
with
the
collar
of
the
period
and
a
dark
tie
lady
laura
was
in
a
flutter
of
welcome
pouring
out
little
sentences
leading
him
to
a
seat
introducing
him
and
finally
pressing
refreshments
into
his
hands
it
is
too
good
of
you
she
said
too
good
of
you
with
all
your
engagements
these
gentlemen
are
most
anxious
stapleton
of
course
you
know
and
you
will
just
sit
and
talk
to
us
like
friends
wo
you
no
no
no
formal
speech
at
all
just
a
few
words
and
you
will
allow
us
to
ask
you
questions
and
so
on
meanwhile
laurie
observed
the
carefully
and
narrowly
and
was
quite
unable
to
see
any
of
the
unpleasant
qualities
he
had
expected
he
sat
easily
without
or
arrogance
or
unpleasant
humility
he
had
a
pair
of
pleasant
shrewd
and
rather
kind
eyes
and
his
voice
when
he
said
a
word
or
two
in
answer
to
lady
laura
volubility
was
of
that
resonant
softness
that
is
always
a
delight
to
hear
in
fact
his
whole
bearing
and
personality
was
that
of
a
rather
exceptional
average
man
a
publisher
it
might
be
or
a
retired
lawyer
a
family
man
with
a
sober
round
of
life
and
ordinary
duties
who
brought
to
their
fulfillment
a
wholesome
kindly
but
distinctly
strong
character
of
his
own
laurie
hardly
knew
whether
he
was
pleased
or
disappointed
he
would
almost
have
preferred
a
wild
creature
with
rolling
eyes
in
a
cloak
yet
he
would
have
been
secretly
amused
and
contemptuous
at
such
a
man
the
sitting
is
off
for
sunday
by
the
way
lady
laura
said
the
indeed
how
is
that
oh
there
was
some
mistake
about
the
rooms
it
the
fault
you
must
blame
me
lady
laura
cried
out
her
dismay
and
disappointment
and
stapleton
played
chorus
it
was
tiresome
they
said
provoking
particularly
just
now
when
annie
was
so
complacent
stapleton
explained
kindly
to
the
two
young
gentlemen
that
annie
was
a
spirit
who
had
lately
made
various
very
interesting
revelations
what
was
to
be
done
were
there
no
other
rooms
vincent
shook
his
head
it
was
too
late
he
said
to
make
arrangements
now
while
the
ladies
continued
to
buzz
and
jamieson
to
listen
from
the
extreme
edge
of
his
chair
laurie
continued
to
make
mental
comments
he
felt
distinctly
puzzled
by
the
marked
difference
between
the
prophet
and
his
disciples
these
were
so
shallow
this
so
impressive
by
the
most
ordinary
of
all
methods
and
the
most
difficult
of
imitation
that
is
by
sheer
human
personality
he
could
not
grasp
the
least
common
multiple
of
the
two
sides
yet
this
man
tolerated
these
women
and
indeed
seemed
very
kind
and
friendly
towards
them
he
seemed
to
possess
that
sort
of
competence
which
rises
from
the
fact
of
having
ideas
and
complete
certitude
about
them
and
at
last
a
pause
came
vincent
set
down
his
cup
for
the
second
time
refused
buttered
bun
and
waited
yes
do
smoke
mr
vincent
the
man
drew
out
his
smiling
offering
it
to
the
two
men
laurie
took
one
the
clergyman
refused
and
now
mr
vincent
again
he
smiled
in
a
way
but
no
speeches
i
think
you
said
he
remarked
oh
well
you
know
what
i
mean
just
like
friends
you
know
treat
us
all
like
that
stapleton
rose
came
nearer
the
circle
rustled
down
again
and
sank
into
an
elaborate
silence
well
what
is
it
these
gentlemen
wish
to
hear
everything
everything
cried
lady
laura
they
claim
to
know
nothing
at
all
laurie
thought
it
time
to
explain
himself
a
little
he
felt
he
would
not
like
to
take
this
man
at
an
unfair
advantage
i
should
just
like
to
say
this
he
said
i
have
told
stapleton
already
it
is
this
i
must
confess
that
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
am
not
a
believer
but
neither
am
i
a
skeptic
i
am
just
a
real
agnostic
in
this
matter
i
have
read
several
books
and
i
have
been
impressed
but
there
a
great
deal
in
them
that
seems
to
me
nonsense
perhaps
i
had
better
say
which
i
do
understand
this
materializing
business
for
instance
i
can
understand
that
the
minds
of
the
dead
can
affect
ours
but
i
do
see
how
they
can
affect
matter
in
for
instance
and
still
more
in
appearing
and
our
being
able
to
touch
and
see
them
i
think
that
my
position
he
ended
rather
lamely
the
fact
was
that
he
was
a
little
disconcerted
by
the
other
eyes
they
were
as
i
have
said
kind
and
shrewd
eyes
but
they
had
a
good
deal
of
power
as
well
vincent
sat
motionless
during
this
little
speech
just
looking
at
him
not
at
all
offensively
yet
with
the
effect
of
making
the
young
man
feel
rather
like
a
defiant
and
naughty
little
boy
who
is
trying
to
explain
laurie
sat
back
and
drew
on
his
cigarette
rather
hard
i
understand
perfectly
said
the
steady
voice
you
are
in
a
very
reasonable
position
i
wish
all
were
as
may
i
say
a
word
or
two
please
well
it
is
materialization
that
puzzles
you
is
it
exactly
said
laurie
our
theologians
tell
us
by
the
way
i
am
a
catholic
the
other
bowed
a
little
our
theologians
i
believe
tell
us
that
such
a
thing
can
not
be
except
under
peculiar
circumstances
as
in
the
lives
of
the
saints
and
so
on
are
you
bound
to
believe
all
that
your
theologians
say
asked
the
other
quietly
well
it
would
be
very
rash
indeed
began
laurie
exactly
i
see
but
what
if
you
approach
it
from
the
other
side
and
try
to
find
out
instead
whether
these
things
actually
do
happen
i
do
not
wish
to
be
rude
baxter
but
you
remember
that
your
theologians
i
am
not
so
foolish
as
to
say
the
church
for
i
know
that
that
was
not
so
but
your
theologians
you
know
made
a
mistake
about
galileo
laurie
winced
a
little
jamieson
cleared
his
throat
in
gentle
approval
now
i
do
ask
you
to
accept
anything
contrary
to
your
faith
went
on
the
other
gently
but
if
you
really
wish
to
look
into
this
matter
you
must
set
aside
for
the
present
all
other
presuppositions
you
must
not
begin
by
assuming
that
the
theologians
are
always
right
nor
even
in
asking
how
or
why
these
things
should
happen
the
one
point
is
they
happen
his
last
words
had
a
curious
little
effect
as
of
a
sudden
flame
he
had
spoken
smoothly
and
quietly
then
he
had
suddenly
put
an
unexpected
emphasis
into
the
little
sentence
at
the
end
laurie
jumped
internally
yes
that
was
the
point
he
assented
internally
now
went
on
the
other
again
in
that
slow
reassuring
voice
flicking
off
the
ash
of
his
cigarette
is
it
possible
for
you
to
doubt
that
these
things
happen
may
i
ask
you
what
books
you
have
read
laurie
named
three
or
four
and
they
have
not
convinced
you
not
altogether
yet
you
accept
human
evidence
for
a
great
many
much
more
remarkable
things
than
these
as
a
catholic
that
is
divine
revelation
said
laurie
sure
of
his
ground
pardon
me
said
the
other
i
do
not
in
the
least
say
it
is
not
divine
revelation
that
is
another
question
but
you
receive
the
statement
that
it
is
so
on
the
word
of
man
is
that
not
true
laurie
was
silent
he
did
not
quite
know
what
to
say
and
he
almost
feared
the
next
words
but
he
was
astonished
that
the
other
did
not
press
home
the
point
think
over
that
baxter
that
is
all
i
ask
and
now
for
the
real
thing
you
sincerely
wish
to
be
convinced
i
am
ready
to
be
convinced
the
medium
paused
an
instant
looking
intently
at
the
fire
then
he
tossed
the
stump
of
his
cigarette
away
and
lighted
another
the
two
ladies
sat
motionless
you
seem
fond
of
arguments
baxter
he
began
with
a
kindly
smile
let
us
have
one
or
two
then
consider
first
the
relation
of
your
soul
to
your
body
that
is
infinitely
mysterious
is
it
not
an
emotion
rises
in
your
soul
and
a
flush
of
blood
marks
it
that
is
the
subconscious
mechanism
of
your
body
but
to
say
that
does
not
explain
it
it
is
only
a
label
you
follow
me
yes
or
still
more
mysterious
is
your
conscious
power
you
will
to
raise
your
hand
and
it
obeys
muscular
action
oh
yes
but
that
is
but
another
label
he
turned
his
eyes
suddenly
somber
upon
the
staring
listening
young
man
and
his
voice
rose
a
little
go
right
behind
all
that
baxter
down
to
the
mysteries
what
is
that
link
between
soul
and
body
you
do
not
know
nor
does
the
wisest
scientist
in
the
world
nor
ever
will
yet
there
the
link
is
again
he
paused
laurie
was
aware
of
a
rising
interest
far
beyond
the
power
of
the
words
he
heard
yet
the
manner
of
these
too
was
striking
it
was
not
the
sham
mysticism
he
had
expected
there
was
a
certain
reverence
in
them
an
admitting
of
mysteries
that
seemed
hard
to
reconcile
with
the
ideas
he
had
formed
of
the
dogmatism
of
these
folk
now
begin
again
continued
the
quiet
virile
voice
you
believe
as
a
christian
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
in
the
survival
of
personality
after
death
thank
god
for
that
all
do
not
in
these
days
then
i
need
not
labor
at
that
now
baxter
imagine
to
yourself
some
soul
that
you
have
loved
passionately
who
has
crossed
over
to
the
other
side
laurie
drew
a
long
noiseless
breath
steadying
himself
with
clenched
hands
she
has
come
to
the
unimaginable
glories
according
to
her
measure
she
is
at
an
end
of
doubts
and
fears
and
suspicions
she
knows
because
she
sees
but
do
you
think
that
she
is
absorbed
in
these
things
you
know
nothing
of
human
love
baxter
the
voice
trembled
with
genuine
emotion
if
you
can
think
that
if
you
can
think
that
her
thought
turns
only
to
herself
and
her
joys
why
her
life
has
been
lived
in
your
love
by
our
hypothesis
you
were
at
her
bedside
when
she
died
perhaps
and
she
clung
to
you
as
to
god
himself
when
the
shadow
deepened
do
you
think
that
her
first
thought
or
at
least
her
second
will
not
be
of
you
in
all
that
she
sees
she
will
desire
you
to
see
it
also
she
will
strive
crave
hunger
for
you
not
that
she
may
possess
you
but
that
you
may
be
one
with
her
in
her
own
possession
she
will
send
out
vibration
after
vibration
of
sympathy
and
longing
and
you
on
this
side
will
be
tuned
to
her
as
none
other
can
be
you
on
this
side
will
be
empty
for
her
love
for
the
sight
and
sound
of
her
is
death
then
so
strong
stronger
than
love
can
a
christian
believe
that
the
change
in
the
man
was
extraordinary
his
heavy
beard
and
brows
hid
half
his
face
but
his
whole
being
glowed
passionately
in
his
voice
even
in
his
little
trembling
gestures
and
laurie
sat
astonished
every
word
uttered
seemed
to
fit
his
own
case
to
express
by
an
almost
perfect
vehicle
the
vague
thoughts
that
had
struggled
in
his
own
heart
during
this
last
week
it
was
amy
of
whom
the
man
spoke
amy
with
her
eyes
and
hair
peering
from
the
glorious
gloom
to
catch
some
glimpse
of
her
lover
in
his
meaningless
light
of
earthly
day
vincent
cleared
his
throat
a
little
and
at
the
sound
the
two
motionless
women
stirred
and
rustled
a
little
the
sound
of
a
hansom
the
spanking
trot
and
wintry
jingle
of
bells
swelled
out
of
the
distance
passed
and
went
into
silence
before
he
spoke
again
then
it
was
in
his
usual
slow
voice
that
he
continued
conceive
such
a
soul
as
that
baxter
she
desires
to
communicate
with
one
she
loves
on
earth
with
you
or
me
and
it
is
a
human
and
innocent
desire
yet
she
has
lost
that
connection
that
machinery
of
which
we
have
spoken
that
connection
of
which
we
know
nothing
between
matter
and
spirit
except
that
it
exists
what
is
she
to
do
well
at
least
she
will
do
this
she
will
bend
every
power
that
she
possesses
upon
that
medium
i
mean
matter
through
which
alone
the
communication
can
be
made
as
a
man
on
an
island
beyond
the
power
of
a
human
voice
will
use
any
instrument
however
grotesque
to
signal
to
a
passing
ship
would
any
decent
man
baxter
mock
at
the
pathos
and
effort
of
that
even
if
it
were
some
grotesque
thing
like
a
flannel
shirt
on
the
end
of
an
oar
yet
men
mock
at
the
tapping
of
a
table
well
then
this
longing
soul
uses
every
means
at
her
disposal
concentrates
every
power
she
possesses
is
it
so
very
unreasonable
so
very
unchristian
so
very
dishonoring
to
the
love
of
god
to
think
that
she
sometimes
succeeds
that
she
is
able
under
comparatively
exceptional
circumstances
to
that
connection
with
material
things
that
was
perfectly
normal
and
natural
to
her
during
her
earthly
life
tell
me
mr
baxter
laurie
shifted
a
little
in
his
chair
i
can
not
say
that
it
is
he
said
in
a
voice
that
seemed
strange
in
his
own
ears
the
medium
smiled
a
little
so
much
for
reasoning
he
said
there
remains
only
the
fact
whether
such
things
do
happen
or
not
there
i
must
leave
you
to
yourself
mr
baxter
laurie
sat
forward
suddenly
but
that
is
exactly
where
i
need
your
help
sir
he
said
a
murmur
broke
from
the
ladies
lips
simultaneously
resembling
applause
jamieson
sat
back
and
swallowed
perceptibly
in
his
throat
you
have
said
so
much
sir
went
on
laurie
deliberately
that
you
have
so
to
speak
put
yourself
in
my
debt
i
must
ask
you
to
take
me
further
vincent
smiled
full
at
him
you
must
take
your
place
with
others
he
said
these
ladies
vincent
vincent
cried
lady
laura
he
is
quite
right
you
must
help
him
you
must
help
us
all
well
sunday
week
he
began
deprecatingly
stapleton
broke
in
no
no
now
vincent
now
do
something
now
surely
the
circumstances
are
favorable
i
must
be
gone
again
at
said
the
man
hesitatingly
laurie
broke
in
he
felt
desperate
if
you
can
show
me
anything
of
this
sir
you
can
surely
show
it
now
if
you
do
not
show
it
now
well
mr
baxter
put
in
the
voice
sharp
and
incisive
as
if
expecting
an
insult
and
challenging
it
laurie
broke
down
i
can
only
say
he
cried
that
i
beg
and
entreat
of
you
to
do
what
you
can
now
and
here
there
was
a
silence
and
you
mr
jamieson
the
young
clergyman
started
as
if
from
a
daze
then
he
rose
abruptly
i
i
must
be
going
lady
laura
he
said
i
had
no
idea
it
was
so
late
i
i
have
a
confirmation
class
an
instant
later
he
was
gone
that
is
as
well
observed
the
medium
and
you
are
sure
baxter
that
you
wish
me
to
try
you
must
remember
that
i
promise
nothing
i
wish
you
to
try
and
if
nothing
happens
if
nothing
happens
i
will
promise
to
to
continue
my
search
i
shall
know
then
that
that
it
is
at
least
sincere
vincent
rose
to
his
feet
a
little
table
just
here
lady
laura
if
you
please
and
a
pencil
and
paper
will
you
kindly
take
your
seats
yes
baxter
draw
up
your
chair
here
now
please
we
must
have
complete
silence
and
so
far
as
possible
silence
of
thought
ii
the
table
a
small
round
rosewood
one
stood
bare
of
any
cloth
upon
the
hearthrug
the
two
ladies
sat
motionless
statues
once
more
upon
the
side
furthest
from
the
fire
with
their
hands
resting
lightly
upon
the
surface
laurie
sat
on
one
side
and
the
medium
on
the
other
vincent
had
received
his
paper
and
pencil
almost
immediately
and
now
sat
resting
his
right
hand
with
the
pencil
upon
the
paper
as
if
to
write
his
left
hand
upon
his
knee
as
he
sat
turned
away
slightly
from
the
center
laurie
looked
at
him
closely
and
now
he
began
to
be
aware
of
a
certain
quite
indefinable
change
in
the
face
at
which
he
looked
the
eyes
were
open
no
it
was
not
in
them
that
the
change
lay
nor
in
the
lines
about
the
mouth
so
far
as
he
could
see
them
nor
in
any
detail
anywhere
neither
was
it
the
face
of
a
dreamer
or
a
sleepwalker
or
of
the
dead
when
the
lines
disappear
and
life
retires
it
was
a
living
conscious
face
yet
it
was
changed
the
lips
were
slightly
parted
and
the
breath
came
evenly
between
them
it
was
more
like
the
face
of
one
lost
in
deep
absorbed
introspective
thought
laurie
decided
that
this
was
the
explanation
he
looked
at
the
hand
on
the
paper
well
shaped
brownish
capable
perfectly
motionless
the
pencil
held
lightly
between
the
finger
and
thumb
then
he
glanced
up
at
the
two
ladies
they
too
were
perfectly
motionless
but
there
was
no
change
in
them
the
eyes
of
both
were
downcast
fixed
steadily
upon
the
paper
and
as
he
looked
he
saw
lady
laura
begin
to
lift
her
lids
slowly
as
if
to
glance
at
him
he
looked
himself
upon
the
paper
and
the
motionless
fingers
he
was
astonished
at
the
speed
with
which
the
situation
had
developed
five
minutes
ago
he
had
been
listening
to
talk
and
joining
in
it
the
clergyman
had
been
here
he
himself
had
been
sitting
a
yard
further
back
now
they
sat
here
as
if
they
had
sat
for
an
hour
it
seemed
that
the
progress
of
events
had
stopped
then
he
began
to
listen
for
the
sounds
of
the
world
outside
for
within
here
it
seemed
as
if
a
silence
of
a
very
strange
quality
had
suddenly
descended
and
enveloped
them
it
was
as
if
a
section
that
place
in
which
he
sat
had
been
cut
out
of
time
and
space
it
was
apart
here
it
was
different
altogether
he
began
to
be
intensely
and
minutely
conscious
of
the
world
outside
so
entirely
conscious
that
he
lost
all
perception
of
that
at
which
he
stared
whether
it
was
the
paper
or
the
strong
motionless
hand
or
the
introspective
face
he
was
afterwards
unaware
but
he
heard
all
the
quiet
roar
of
the
london
evening
and
was
able
to
distinguish
even
the
note
of
each
instrument
that
helped
to
make
up
that
untiring
inconclusive
orchestra
far
away
to
the
northwards
sounded
a
great
thoroughfare
the
rolling
of
wheels
a
myriad
hoofs
the
pulse
of
motor
vehicles
and
the
cries
of
street
boys
upon
all
these
his
attention
dwelt
as
they
came
up
through
the
outward
windows
into
that
dead
silent
room
of
which
he
had
lost
consciousness
again
a
hansom
came
up
the
street
with
the
rap
of
hoofs
the
swish
of
a
whip
the
wintry
jingle
of
bells
he
began
gently
to
consider
these
things
to
perceive
rather
than
to
form
little
inward
pictures
of
what
they
signified
he
saw
the
lighted
omnibus
the
little
swirl
of
faces
round
a
then
he
began
to
consider
what
had
brought
him
here
it
seemed
that
he
saw
himself
coming
in
his
dark
suit
across
the
park
turning
into
the
thoroughfare
and
across
it
he
began
to
consider
amy
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
this
intense
and
living
silence
he
was
conscious
of
her
for
the
first
time
without
sorrow
since
ten
days
ago
he
began
to
consider
something
brought
him
back
in
an
instant
to
the
room
and
his
perception
of
it
but
he
had
not
an
idea
what
this
was
whether
a
movement
or
a
sound
but
on
considering
it
afterwards
he
remembered
that
it
was
as
that
sound
is
that
wakes
a
man
at
the
very
instant
of
his
falling
asleep
a
sharp
momentary
tick
as
of
a
clock
yet
he
had
not
been
in
the
least
sleepy
on
the
contrary
he
perceived
now
with
an
extreme
and
alert
attention
the
hand
on
the
paper
he
even
turned
his
head
slightly
to
see
if
the
pencil
had
moved
it
was
as
motionless
as
at
the
beginning
he
glanced
up
with
a
touch
of
surprise
at
his
hostess
face
and
caught
her
in
the
very
act
of
turning
her
eyes
from
his
there
was
no
impatience
in
her
movement
rather
her
face
was
of
one
absorbed
listening
intently
not
like
the
bearded
face
opposite
introspective
and
intuitive
but
eagerly
though
motionlessly
observant
of
the
objective
world
he
looked
at
stapleton
she
too
bore
the
same
expression
of
intent
regarding
thought
on
her
usually
rather
tiresome
face
then
once
again
the
silence
began
to
come
down
like
a
long
noiseless
hush
this
time
however
his
progress
was
swifter
and
more
sure
he
passed
with
the
speed
of
thought
through
those
processes
that
had
been
measurable
before
faintly
conscious
of
the
words
spoken
before
the
sitting
began
if
possible
the
silence
of
thought
he
thought
he
understood
now
what
this
signified
and
that
he
was
experiencing
it
no
longer
did
he
dwell
upon
or
consider
with
any
voluntary
activity
the
images
that
passed
before
him
rather
they
moved
past
him
while
he
simply
regarded
them
without
understanding
his
perception
ran
swiftly
outwards
as
through
concentric
circles
yet
he
was
not
sure
whether
it
were
outwards
or
inwards
that
he
went
the
roar
of
london
with
its
flight
of
ocular
visions
sank
behind
him
and
without
any
further
sense
of
mental
travel
he
found
himself
perceiving
his
own
home
whether
in
memory
imagination
or
fact
he
did
not
know
but
he
perceived
his
mother
in
the
familiar
room
over
her
needlework
and
maggie
maggie
looking
at
him
with
a
strange
almost
terrified
expression
in
her
great
eyes
then
these
too
were
gone
and
he
was
out
in
some
warm
silence
filled
with
a
single
presence
that
which
he
desired
and
there
he
stopped
he
was
not
in
the
least
aware
of
how
long
this
lasted
but
he
found
himself
at
a
certain
moment
in
time
looking
steadily
at
the
white
paper
on
the
table
from
which
the
hand
had
gone
again
conscious
of
the
sudden
passing
of
some
clear
sound
that
left
no
echo
as
sharp
as
the
crack
of
a
whip
oh
the
paper
that
was
the
important
point
he
bent
a
little
closer
and
was
aware
of
a
sharp
disappointment
as
he
saw
it
was
stainless
of
writing
then
he
was
astonished
that
the
hand
and
pencil
had
gone
from
it
and
looked
up
quickly
vincent
was
looking
at
him
with
a
strange
expression
at
first
he
thought
he
might
have
interrupted
and
wondered
with
dismay
whether
this
were
so
but
there
was
no
sign
of
anger
in
those
eyes
nothing
but
a
curious
and
kindly
interest
nothing
happened
he
exclaimed
hastily
you
have
written
nothing
he
looked
at
the
ladies
lady
laura
too
was
looking
at
him
with
the
same
strange
interest
as
the
medium
stapleton
he
noticed
was
just
folding
up
in
an
unobtrusive
manner
several
sheets
of
paper
that
he
had
not
noticed
before
he
felt
a
little
stiff
and
moved
as
if
to
stand
up
but
to
his
astonishment
the
big
man
was
up
in
an
instant
laying
his
hands
on
his
shoulders
just
sit
still
quietly
for
a
few
minutes
said
the
kindly
voice
just
sit
still
why
why
began
laurie
bewildered
yes
just
sit
still
quietly
went
on
the
voice
you
feel
a
little
tired
just
a
little
said
laurie
but
yes
yes
just
sit
still
no
do
speak
then
a
silence
fell
again
laurie
began
to
wonder
what
this
was
all
about
certainly
he
felt
tired
yet
strangely
elated
but
he
felt
no
inclination
to
move
and
sat
back
passive
looking
at
his
own
hands
on
his
knees
but
he
was
disappointed
that
nothing
had
happened
then
the
thought
of
time
came
into
his
mind
he
supposed
that
it
would
be
about
ten
minutes
past
six
the
sitting
had
begun
a
little
before
six
he
glanced
up
at
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
but
it
was
one
of
those
empire
gilt
affairs
that
display
everything
except
the
hour
he
still
waited
a
moment
feeling
all
this
to
be
very
unusual
and
unconventional
why
should
he
sit
here
like
an
invalid
and
why
should
these
three
sit
here
and
watch
him
so
closely
he
shifted
a
little
in
his
chair
feeling
that
an
effort
was
due
from
him
the
question
of
the
time
of
day
struck
him
as
a
suitably
conventional
remark
with
which
to
break
the
embarrassing
silence
what
is
the
time
he
said
i
am
afraid
i
ought
to
be
there
is
plenty
of
time
said
the
grave
voice
across
the
table
with
a
sudden
movement
laurie
was
on
his
feet
peering
at
the
clock
knowing
that
something
was
wrong
somewhere
then
he
turned
to
the
company
bewildered
and
suspicious
why
it
is
nearly
eight
he
cried
vincent
smiled
reassuringly
it
is
about
that
he
said
please
sit
down
again
mr
baxter
but
but
began
laurie
please
sit
down
again
baxter
repeated
the
voice
with
a
touch
of
imperiousness
that
there
was
no
resisting
laurie
sat
down
again
but
he
was
alert
suspicious
and
intensely
puzzled
will
you
kindly
tell
me
what
has
happened
he
asked
sharply
you
feel
tired
no
i
am
all
right
kindly
tell
me
what
has
happened
he
saw
lady
laura
whisper
something
in
an
undertone
he
could
not
hear
vincent
stood
up
with
a
nod
and
leaned
himself
against
the
mantelpiece
looking
down
at
the
rather
indignant
young
man
certainly
he
said
you
are
sure
you
are
not
exhausted
mr
baxter
not
in
the
least
said
laurie
well
then
you
passed
into
trance
about
five
minutes
you
passed
into
trance
about
five
minutes
past
six
you
came
out
of
it
five
minutes
ago
trance
gasped
laurie
certainly
a
very
deep
and
satisfactory
trance
there
is
nothing
to
be
frightened
of
baxter
it
is
an
unusual
gift
that
is
all
i
have
seldom
seen
a
more
satisfactory
instance
may
i
ask
you
a
question
or
two
sir
laurie
nodded
vaguely
he
was
still
trying
hopelessly
to
take
in
what
had
been
said
you
nearly
passed
into
trance
a
little
earlier
may
i
ask
whether
you
heard
or
saw
anything
that
recalled
you
laurie
shut
his
eyes
tight
in
an
effort
to
think
he
felt
dimly
rather
proud
of
himself
it
was
quite
short
then
you
came
back
and
looked
at
lady
laura
try
to
remember
i
remember
thinking
i
had
heard
a
sound
the
medium
nodded
just
so
he
said
that
would
be
the
third
said
lady
laura
nodding
sagely
third
what
said
laurie
rather
rudely
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
him
now
can
you
give
any
account
of
the
last
hour
and
a
half
continued
the
medium
tranquilly
laurie
considered
again
he
was
still
a
little
confused
i
remember
thinking
about
the
streets
he
said
and
then
of
my
own
home
and
then
he
stopped
yes
and
then
then
of
a
certain
private
matter
ah
we
must
not
pry
then
but
can
you
answer
one
question
more
was
it
connected
with
any
person
who
has
crossed
over
it
was
said
laurie
shortly
just
so
said
the
medium
laurie
felt
suspicious
why
do
you
ask
that
he
said
vincent
looked
at
him
steadily
i
think
i
had
better
tell
you
baxter
it
is
more
straightforward
though
you
will
not
like
it
you
will
be
surprised
to
hear
that
you
talked
very
considerably
during
this
hour
and
a
half
and
from
all
that
you
said
i
should
suppose
you
were
controlled
by
a
spirit
recently
crossed
over
a
young
girl
who
on
being
questioned
gave
the
name
of
amy
nugent
laurie
sprang
to
his
feet
furious
you
have
been
spying
sir
how
dare
you
sit
down
baxter
or
you
shall
not
hear
a
word
more
rang
out
the
imperious
unruffled
voice
sit
down
this
instant
laurie
shot
a
look
at
the
two
ladies
then
he
remembered
himself
he
sat
down
i
am
not
at
all
angry
baxter
came
the
voice
suave
and
kindly
again
your
thought
was
very
natural
but
i
think
i
can
prove
to
you
that
you
are
mistaken
vincent
glanced
at
stapleton
with
an
almost
imperceptible
frown
then
back
at
laurie
let
me
see
baxter
is
there
anyone
on
earth
besides
yourself
who
knew
that
you
had
sat
out
about
ten
days
ago
or
so
under
some
yew
trees
in
your
garden
at
home
and
thought
of
this
young
girl
that
you
laurie
looked
at
him
in
dumb
dismay
some
little
sound
broke
from
his
mouth
well
is
that
enough
mr
baxter
lady
laura
slid
in
a
sentence
here
dear
baxter
you
need
not
be
in
the
least
alarmed
all
that
has
passed
here
is
of
course
as
sacred
as
in
the
confessional
we
should
not
dream
without
your
leave
one
moment
gasped
the
boy
he
drove
his
face
into
his
hands
and
sat
overwhelmed
presently
he
looked
up
but
i
knew
it
he
said
i
knew
it
it
was
just
my
own
self
which
spoke
the
medium
smiled
yes
he
said
of
course
that
is
the
first
answer
he
placed
one
hand
on
the
table
leaning
forward
and
began
to
play
his
fingers
as
if
on
a
piano
laurie
watched
the
movement
which
seemed
vaguely
familiar
can
you
account
for
that
baxter
you
did
that
several
times
it
seemed
uncharacteristic
of
you
somehow
laurie
looked
at
him
mute
he
remembered
now
he
half
raised
a
hand
in
protest
and
and
do
you
ever
stammer
went
on
the
man
still
laurie
was
silent
it
was
beyond
belief
or
imagination
now
if
those
things
were
characteristic
stop
sir
cried
the
boy
and
then
but
those
too
might
be
unconscious
imitation
they
might
said
the
other
but
then
we
had
the
advantage
of
watching
you
and
there
were
other
things
i
beg
your
pardon
there
was
the
loud
continuous
rapping
at
the
beginning
and
the
end
you
were
awakened
twice
by
these
laurie
remained
perfectly
motionless
without
a
word
he
was
still
striving
to
marshal
this
flood
of
mad
ideas
it
was
incredible
amazing
then
he
stood
up
i
must
go
away
he
said
i
i
do
know
what
to
think
you
had
better
stay
a
little
longer
and
rest
said
the
medium
kindly
the
boy
shook
his
head
i
must
go
at
once
he
said
i
can
not
trust
myself
he
went
out
without
a
word
followed
by
the
medium
the
two
ladies
sat
eyeing
one
another
it
has
been
astonishing
astonishing
sighed
stapleton
what
a
find
there
was
no
more
said
lady
laura
sat
as
one
in
trance
herself
then
vincent
returned
you
must
not
lose
sight
of
that
young
man
he
said
abruptly
it
is
an
extraordinary
case
i
have
all
the
notes
here
remarked
stapleton
yes
you
had
better
keep
them
he
must
not
see
them
at
present
i
as
the
weeks
went
by
maggie
faint
uneasiness
disappeared
she
was
one
of
those
fortunate
persons
who
possessing
what
are
known
as
nerves
are
aware
of
the
possession
and
discount
their
effects
accordingly
that
uneasiness
had
culminated
a
few
days
after
laurie
departure
one
evening
as
she
sat
with
the
old
lady
after
tea
in
a
sudden
touch
of
terror
at
she
knew
not
what
what
is
the
matter
my
dear
the
old
lady
had
said
without
warning
maggie
was
reading
but
it
appeared
that
baxter
had
noticed
her
lower
her
book
suddenly
with
an
odd
expression
maggie
had
blinked
a
moment
nothing
she
said
i
was
just
thinking
of
laurie
i
do
know
why
but
since
then
she
had
been
able
to
reassure
herself
her
fancies
were
but
fancies
she
told
herself
and
they
had
ceased
to
trouble
her
the
boy
letters
to
his
mother
were
ordinary
and
natural
he
was
reading
fairly
hard
his
coach
was
as
pleasant
a
person
as
he
had
seemed
he
hoped
to
run
down
to
stantons
for
a
few
days
at
christmas
there
was
nothing
whatever
to
alarm
anyone
plainly
his
ridiculous
attitude
about
spiritualism
had
been
laid
by
and
better
still
he
was
beginning
to
recover
himself
after
his
sorrow
in
september
it
was
an
extraordinarily
peaceful
and
uneventful
life
that
the
two
led
together
the
kind
of
life
that
strengthens
previous
proclivities
and
adds
no
new
ones
that
brings
out
the
framework
of
character
and
motive
as
dropping
water
clears
the
buried
roots
of
a
tree
this
was
all
very
well
for
baxter
whose
character
was
already
fully
formed
it
may
be
hoped
but
not
so
utterly
satisfactory
for
the
girl
though
the
process
was
pleasant
enough
after
mass
and
breakfast
she
spent
the
morning
as
she
wished
overseeing
little
extra
details
of
the
house
gardening
plans
the
poultry
and
so
forth
and
reading
what
she
cared
to
the
afternoon
was
devoted
to
the
old
lady
airing
the
evening
till
dinner
to
anything
she
wished
and
after
dinner
again
to
gentle
conversation
very
little
happened
the
vicar
and
his
wife
dined
there
occasionally
and
still
more
occasionally
father
mahon
now
and
then
there
were
vague
entertainments
to
be
patronized
in
the
village
schoolroom
in
an
atmosphere
of
ink
and
and
a
mild
amount
of
rather
dreary
and
stately
gaiety
connected
with
the
big
houses
round
baxter
occasionally
put
in
appearances
a
dignified
and
aristocratic
old
figure
with
her
gentle
eyes
and
black
lace
veil
and
maggie
went
with
her
the
pleasure
of
this
life
grew
steadily
upon
maggie
she
was
one
of
that
fraction
of
the
world
that
finds
entertainment
to
lie
like
the
kingdom
of
god
within
she
did
not
in
the
least
wish
to
be
amused
or
stimulated
and
distracted
she
was
perfectly
and
serenely
content
with
the
fowls
the
garden
her
small
selected
tasks
her
religion
and
herself
the
result
was
as
it
always
is
in
such
cases
she
began
to
revolve
about
three
or
four
main
lines
of
thought
and
to
make
a
very
fair
progress
in
the
knowledge
of
herself
she
knew
her
faults
quite
well
and
she
was
not
unaware
of
her
virtues
she
knew
perfectly
that
she
was
apt
to
give
way
to
internal
irritation
of
a
strong
though
invisible
kind
when
interruptions
happened
that
she
now
and
then
gave
way
to
an
unduly
fierce
contempt
of
tiresome
people
and
said
little
bitter
things
that
she
afterwards
regretted
she
also
knew
that
she
was
quite
courageous
that
she
had
magnificent
physical
health
and
that
she
could
be
perfectly
content
with
a
life
that
a
good
many
other
people
would
find
narrow
and
stifling
her
own
character
then
was
one
thing
that
she
had
studied
not
in
the
least
in
a
morbid
way
during
her
life
at
stantons
and
another
thing
she
was
beginning
to
study
rather
to
her
own
surprise
was
the
character
of
laurie
she
began
to
become
a
little
astonished
at
the
frequency
with
which
during
a
silent
drive
or
some
mild
mechanical
labor
in
the
gardens
the
image
of
that
young
man
would
rise
before
her
indeed
as
has
been
said
she
had
new
material
to
work
on
she
had
not
realized
till
the
amy
that
boy
astonishing
selfishness
and
it
became
for
her
a
rather
pleasant
psychological
exercise
to
build
up
his
characteristics
into
a
consistent
whole
it
had
not
struck
her
till
this
specimen
came
before
her
notice
how
generosity
and
egotism
for
example
so
far
from
being
mutually
exclusive
can
very
easily
be
complements
each
of
the
other
so
then
she
passed
her
days
exteriorly
a
capable
and
occupied
person
interested
in
half
a
dozen
simple
things
interiorly
rather
introspective
rather
scrupulous
and
intensely
interested
in
the
watching
of
two
characters
her
own
and
her
adopted
brother
baxter
character
needed
no
dissection
it
was
a
consistent
whole
clear
as
crystal
and
as
rigid
it
was
still
some
five
weeks
before
christmas
that
maggie
became
aware
of
what
as
a
british
maiden
she
ought
of
course
to
have
known
long
before
namely
that
she
was
thinking
just
a
little
too
much
about
a
young
man
who
so
far
as
was
apparent
thought
nothing
at
all
about
her
it
was
true
that
once
he
had
passed
through
a
period
of
sentimentality
in
her
regard
but
the
extreme
discouragement
it
had
met
with
had
been
enough
her
discovery
happened
in
this
way
baxter
opened
a
letter
one
morning
smiling
contentedly
to
herself
from
laurie
she
said
maggie
ceased
eating
toast
for
a
second
to
listen
then
the
old
lady
uttered
a
small
cry
of
dismay
he
thinks
he
ca
come
after
all
she
said
maggie
had
a
moment
of
very
acute
annoyance
what
does
he
say
why
not
she
asked
there
was
a
pause
she
watched
baxter
lips
moving
slowly
her
glasses
in
place
saw
the
page
turned
and
turned
again
she
took
another
piece
of
toast
there
are
few
things
more
irritating
than
to
have
fragments
of
a
letter
doled
out
piecemeal
he
does
say
he
just
says
he
very
busy
indeed
and
has
a
great
deal
of
way
to
make
up
the
old
lady
continued
reading
tranquilly
and
laid
the
letter
down
nothing
more
asked
maggie
consumed
with
annoyance
he
been
to
the
theatre
once
or
twice
dear
laurie
i
glad
recovering
his
spirits
maggie
was
very
angry
indeed
she
thought
it
abominable
of
the
boy
to
treat
his
mother
like
that
and
then
there
was
the
shooting
not
much
indeed
beyond
the
rabbits
which
the
man
who
acted
as
occasional
keeper
told
her
wanted
thinning
and
a
dozen
or
two
of
wild
pheasants
yet
this
shooting
had
always
been
done
she
understood
at
christmas
ever
since
master
laurie
had
been
old
enough
to
hold
a
gun
she
determined
to
write
him
a
letter
when
breakfast
was
over
with
a
resolved
face
she
went
to
her
room
she
would
really
tell
this
boy
a
or
two
it
was
a
a
sister
place
to
do
so
the
mother
she
knew
well
enough
would
do
no
more
than
send
a
little
wail
and
would
end
by
telling
the
dear
boy
that
of
course
he
knew
best
and
that
she
was
very
happy
to
think
that
he
was
taking
such
pains
about
his
studies
someone
must
point
out
to
the
boy
his
overwhelming
selfishness
and
it
seemed
that
no
one
was
at
hand
but
herself
therefore
she
would
do
it
she
did
it
therefore
politely
enough
but
unmistakably
and
as
it
was
a
fine
morning
she
thought
that
she
would
like
to
step
up
to
the
village
and
post
it
she
did
not
want
to
relent
and
once
the
letter
was
in
the
the
thing
would
be
done
it
was
indeed
a
delicious
morning
as
she
passed
out
through
the
iron
gate
the
trees
overhead
still
with
a
few
brown
belated
leaves
soared
up
in
filigree
of
exquisite
workmanship
into
a
sky
of
clear
november
blue
as
fresh
as
a
egg
the
genial
sound
of
rose
silver
and
exultant
from
the
farm
beyond
the
road
and
the
tiny
street
of
the
hamlet
looked
as
clean
as
a
dutch
picture
she
noticed
on
the
right
just
before
she
turned
up
to
the
village
on
the
left
the
grocer
shop
with
the
name
nugent
in
capitals
as
bright
and
flamboyant
as
on
the
depot
of
a
merchant
king
nugent
could
be
faintly
descried
within
in
white
and
an
apron
busied
at
a
pile
of
cheeses
overhead
three
pairs
of
lace
curtains
each
decked
with
a
blue
bow
denoted
the
bedrooms
one
of
them
must
have
been
amy
she
wondered
which
all
up
the
road
to
the
village
some
in
length
she
pondered
amy
she
had
never
seen
her
to
her
knowledge
but
she
had
a
tolerably
accurate
mental
picture
of
her
from
baxter
account
ah
how
could
laurie
how
could
he
laurie
of
all
people
it
was
just
one
more
example
after
dropping
her
letter
into
the
box
at
the
corner
she
hesitated
for
an
instant
then
with
an
odd
look
on
her
face
she
turned
sharply
aside
to
where
the
church
tower
pricked
above
the
leafless
trees
it
was
a
typical
little
country
church
with
that
odor
of
the
respectable
and
rather
stuffy
sanctity
peculiar
to
the
class
she
had
wrinkled
her
nose
at
it
more
than
once
in
laurie
company
but
she
passed
by
the
door
of
it
now
and
stepping
among
the
wet
grasses
came
down
the
little
slope
among
the
headstones
to
where
a
very
white
marble
angel
clasped
an
equally
white
marble
cross
she
passed
to
the
front
of
this
and
looked
frowning
a
little
over
the
intolerable
taste
of
the
thing
the
cross
she
perceived
was
wreathed
with
a
spray
of
white
marble
ivory
the
angel
was
a
german
female
with
a
very
rounded
leg
emerging
behind
a
kind
of
button
and
there
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
was
the
inscription
in
startling
black
amy
nugent
the
dear
and
only
daughter
of
amos
and
maria
nugent
of
stantons
died
september
respected
by
all
i
shall
see
her
but
not
now
below
as
vivid
as
the
inscription
there
stood
out
the
maker
name
and
of
the
town
where
he
lived
so
she
lay
there
reflected
maggie
it
had
ended
in
that
a
mound
of
earth
cracking
a
little
and
sunken
she
lay
there
her
nervous
fingers
motionless
and
her
stammer
silent
and
could
there
be
a
more
eloquent
monument
of
what
she
was
then
she
remembered
herself
and
signed
herself
with
the
cross
while
her
lips
moved
an
instant
for
the
repose
of
the
poor
girlish
soul
then
she
stepped
up
again
on
to
the
path
to
go
home
it
was
as
she
came
near
the
church
gate
that
she
understood
herself
that
she
perceived
why
she
had
come
and
was
conscious
for
the
first
time
of
her
real
attitude
of
soul
as
she
had
stood
there
reading
the
inscription
and
in
a
flash
there
followed
the
knowledge
of
the
inevitable
meaning
of
it
all
in
a
word
it
was
this
she
had
come
there
she
told
herself
to
triumph
to
gloat
oh
she
spared
herself
nothing
as
she
stood
there
crimson
with
shame
to
gloat
over
the
grave
of
a
rival
amy
was
nothing
less
than
that
and
she
herself
she
margaret
marie
deronnais
had
given
way
to
jealousy
of
this
grocer
daughter
because
because
she
had
begun
to
care
really
to
care
for
the
man
to
whom
she
had
written
that
letter
this
morning
and
this
man
had
scarcely
said
one
word
to
her
or
given
her
one
glance
beyond
such
as
a
brother
might
give
to
a
sister
there
was
the
naked
truth
her
mind
fled
back
she
understood
a
hundred
things
now
she
perceived
that
that
sudden
anger
at
breakfast
had
been
personal
disappointment
not
at
all
that
lofty
disinterestedness
on
behalf
of
the
mother
that
she
had
pretended
she
understood
too
now
the
meaning
of
those
long
contented
meditations
as
she
went
up
and
down
the
garden
walks
alert
for
plantains
the
meaning
of
the
zeal
she
had
shown
only
a
week
ago
on
behalf
of
a
certain
hazel
which
the
gardener
wanted
to
cut
down
you
had
better
wait
till
laurence
comes
home
she
had
said
i
think
he
once
said
he
liked
the
tree
to
be
just
there
she
understood
now
why
she
had
been
so
intuitive
so
condemnatory
so
critical
of
the
boy
it
was
that
she
was
passionately
interested
in
him
that
it
was
a
pleasure
even
to
abuse
him
to
herself
to
call
him
selfish
and
that
all
this
lofty
disapproval
was
just
the
sop
that
her
subconsciousness
had
used
to
quiet
her
uneasiness
little
scenes
rose
before
her
all
passed
almost
in
a
flash
of
time
as
she
stood
with
her
hand
on
the
latch
of
the
gate
and
she
saw
herself
in
them
all
as
a
proud
unmaidenly
pharisaical
prig
in
love
with
a
man
who
was
not
in
love
with
her
she
made
an
effort
unlatched
the
gate
and
moved
on
a
beautiful
composed
figure
with
great
steady
eyes
and
profile
a
model
of
dignity
and
grace
interiorly
a
raging
abject
wretch
it
must
be
remembered
that
she
was
ii
by
the
time
that
laurie
answer
came
poor
maggie
had
arranged
her
emotions
fairly
satisfactorily
she
came
to
the
conclusion
arrived
at
after
much
that
after
all
she
was
not
yet
actually
in
love
with
laurie
but
was
in
danger
of
being
so
and
that
therefore
now
that
she
knew
the
danger
and
could
guard
against
it
she
need
not
actually
withdraw
from
her
home
and
bury
herself
in
a
convent
or
the
foreign
she
arrived
at
this
astonishing
conclusion
by
the
following
process
of
thought
it
may
be
presented
in
the
form
of
a
syllogism
all
girls
who
are
in
love
regard
the
beloved
as
a
spotless
reproachless
hero
maggie
deronnais
did
not
regard
laurie
baxter
as
a
spotless
reproachless
hero
maggie
deronnais
was
not
in
love
with
laurie
baxter
strange
as
it
may
appear
to
readers
maggie
did
not
confide
her
complications
to
the
ear
of
father
mahon
she
mentioned
no
doubt
on
the
following
saturday
that
she
had
given
way
to
thoughts
of
pride
and
jealousy
that
she
had
deceived
herself
with
regard
to
a
certain
action
done
really
for
selfish
motives
into
thinking
she
had
done
it
for
altruistic
motives
and
there
she
left
it
and
no
doubt
father
mahon
left
it
there
too
and
gave
her
absolution
without
hesitation
then
laurie
answer
arrived
and
had
to
be
dealt
with
that
is
it
had
to
be
treated
interiorly
with
a
proper
restraint
of
emotions
my
dear
maggie
he
wrote
why
all
this
fury
what
have
i
done
i
said
to
mother
that
i
did
know
for
certain
whether
i
could
come
or
not
as
i
had
a
lot
to
do
i
do
think
she
can
have
given
you
the
letter
to
read
or
you
would
have
written
all
that
about
my
being
away
from
home
at
the
one
season
of
the
year
etc
of
course
i
come
if
you
or
anybody
feels
like
that
does
mother
feel
upset
too
please
tell
me
if
she
ever
feels
that
or
is
in
the
least
unwell
or
anything
i
come
instantly
as
it
is
shall
we
say
the
of
december
and
i
stay
at
least
a
week
will
that
do
yours
this
was
a
little
overwhelming
and
maggie
wrote
off
a
penitent
letter
refraining
carefully
however
from
any
expressions
that
might
have
anything
of
the
least
warmth
but
saying
that
she
was
very
glad
he
was
coming
and
that
the
shooting
should
be
seen
to
she
directed
the
letter
and
then
sat
for
an
instant
looking
at
laurie
at
the
neat
hand
the
artistic
appearance
of
the
paragraphs
and
all
the
rest
of
it
she
would
have
liked
to
keep
it
to
put
it
with
half
a
dozen
others
she
had
from
him
but
it
seemed
better
not
then
as
she
tore
it
up
into
careful
strips
her
conscience
smote
her
again
shrewdly
and
she
drew
out
the
top
drawer
of
the
table
at
which
she
sat
there
they
were
a
little
pile
of
them
neat
and
orderly
she
looked
at
them
an
instant
then
she
took
them
out
turned
them
quickly
to
see
if
all
were
there
and
then
gathering
up
the
strips
of
the
one
she
had
received
that
morning
went
over
to
the
wood
fire
and
dropped
them
in
it
was
better
so
she
said
to
herself
the
days
went
pleasantly
enough
after
that
she
would
not
for
an
instant
allow
to
herself
that
any
of
their
smoothness
arose
from
the
fact
that
this
boy
would
be
here
again
in
a
few
weeks
on
the
contrary
it
was
because
she
had
detected
a
weakness
in
his
regard
she
told
herself
and
had
resolutely
stamped
on
it
that
she
was
in
so
serene
a
peace
she
arranged
about
the
shooting
that
is
to
say
she
informed
the
acting
keeper
that
master
laurie
would
be
home
for
christmas
as
usual
all
in
an
unemotional
manner
and
went
about
her
various
affairs
without
effort
she
found
baxter
just
a
little
trying
now
and
then
that
lady
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
laurie
was
unhappy
in
his
religion
certainly
references
to
it
had
dropped
out
of
his
letters
and
that
rymer
must
set
it
right
the
vicar
must
dine
here
at
least
twice
while
laurie
is
here
she
observed
at
breakfast
one
morning
he
has
a
great
influence
with
young
men
maggie
reflected
upon
a
remark
or
two
extremely
unjust
made
by
laurie
with
regard
to
the
clergyman
do
you
think
do
you
think
he
understands
laurie
she
said
he
has
known
him
for
fifteen
years
remarked
baxter
perhaps
it
laurie
that
does
understand
him
then
said
maggie
tranquilly
i
daresay
and
and
what
do
you
think
rymer
will
be
able
to
do
asked
the
girl
just
settle
the
boy
i
do
think
laurie
very
happy
not
that
i
would
willingly
disturb
his
mind
again
i
do
mean
that
my
dear
i
quite
understand
that
your
religion
is
just
the
one
for
certain
temperaments
and
laurie
is
one
of
them
but
a
few
helpful
words
sometimes
baxter
left
it
at
an
aposiopesis
a
form
of
speech
she
was
fond
of
there
was
a
grain
of
truth
maggie
thought
in
the
old
lady
hints
and
she
helped
herself
in
silence
to
marmalade
laurie
letters
which
she
usually
read
did
not
refer
much
to
religion
or
to
the
brompton
oratory
as
his
custom
had
been
at
first
she
tried
to
make
up
her
mind
that
this
was
a
healthy
sign
that
it
showed
that
laurie
was
settling
down
from
that
slight
feverishness
of
zeal
that
seemed
the
inevitable
atmosphere
of
most
converts
maggie
found
converts
a
little
trying
now
and
then
they
would
talk
so
much
about
facts
certainly
undisputed
and
for
that
very
reason
not
to
be
talked
about
laurie
had
been
a
marked
case
she
remembered
he
would
let
the
thing
alone
and
his
contempt
of
anglican
clergy
whom
maggie
herself
regarded
with
respect
was
hard
to
understand
in
fact
she
had
remonstrated
on
the
subject
of
the
vicar
maggie
perceived
that
she
was
letting
her
thoughts
run
again
on
disputable
lines
and
she
made
a
remark
about
the
balkan
crisis
so
abruptly
that
baxter
looked
at
her
in
bewilderment
you
do
jump
about
so
my
dear
we
were
speaking
of
laurie
were
we
not
yes
said
maggie
it
the
twentieth
he
coming
on
is
it
not
yes
said
maggie
i
wonder
what
train
he
come
by
i
do
know
said
maggie
a
few
days
before
laurie
arrival
she
went
to
the
greenhouse
to
see
the
chrysanthemums
there
was
an
excellent
show
of
them
baxter
does
like
them
hairy
ones
said
the
gardener
oh
i
had
forgotten
well
ferris
on
the
nineteenth
i
shall
want
a
big
bunch
of
them
you
better
take
those
those
hairy
ones
and
some
maidenhair
is
there
plenty
yes
miss
can
you
make
a
wreath
ferris
yes
miss
well
will
you
make
a
good
wreath
of
them
please
for
a
grave
the
morning
of
the
twentieth
will
do
there
be
plenty
left
for
the
church
and
house
oh
yes
miss
and
for
father
mahon
oh
yes
miss
very
well
then
will
you
remember
that
a
good
wreath
with
fern
on
the
morning
of
the
twentieth
if
you
just
leave
it
here
i
call
for
it
about
twelve
you
need
send
it
up
to
the
house
i
laurie
was
sitting
in
his
room
after
breakfast
filling
his
briar
pipe
thoughtfully
and
contemplating
his
journey
to
stantons
it
was
more
than
six
weeks
now
since
his
experience
in
queen
gate
and
he
had
gone
through
a
variety
of
emotions
bewildered
terror
was
the
first
a
nervous
interest
the
next
a
truculent
skepticism
the
third
and
lately
to
his
astonishment
the
nervous
interest
had
begun
to
revive
at
first
he
had
been
filled
with
unreasoning
fear
he
had
walked
back
as
far
as
the
gate
of
the
park
hardly
knowing
where
he
went
conscious
only
that
he
must
be
in
the
company
of
his
fellows
upon
finding
himself
on
the
south
side
of
hyde
park
corner
where
travelers
were
few
he
had
crossed
over
in
nervous
haste
to
where
he
might
jostle
human
beings
then
he
had
dined
in
a
restaurant
knowing
that
a
band
would
be
playing
there
and
had
drunk
a
bottle
of
champagne
he
had
gone
to
his
rooms
cheered
and
excited
and
had
leapt
instantly
into
bed
for
fear
that
his
courage
should
evaporate
for
he
was
perfectly
aware
that
fear
and
a
sickening
kind
of
repulsion
formed
a
very
large
element
in
his
emotions
for
nearly
two
hours
unless
three
persons
had
lied
consummately
he
his
essential
being
that
sleepless
self
that
underlies
all
had
been
in
strange
company
had
become
identified
in
some
horrible
manner
with
the
soul
of
a
dead
person
it
was
as
if
he
had
been
informed
some
morning
that
he
had
slept
all
night
with
a
corpse
under
his
bed
he
woke
half
a
dozen
times
that
night
in
the
pleasant
curtained
bedroom
and
each
time
with
the
terror
upon
him
what
if
stories
were
true
and
this
thing
still
haunted
the
air
it
was
remarkable
he
considered
afterwards
how
the
sign
which
he
had
demanded
had
not
had
the
effect
for
which
he
had
hoped
he
was
not
at
all
reassured
by
it
then
as
the
days
went
by
and
he
was
left
in
peace
his
horror
began
to
pass
he
turned
the
thing
over
in
his
mind
a
dozen
times
a
day
and
found
it
absorbing
but
he
began
to
reflect
that
after
all
he
had
nothing
more
than
he
had
had
before
in
the
way
of
evidence
an
hypnotic
sleep
might
explain
the
whole
thing
that
little
revelation
he
had
made
in
his
unconsciousness
of
his
sitting
beneath
the
yews
might
easily
be
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
he
himself
knew
it
that
it
had
been
a
deeper
element
in
his
experience
than
he
had
known
and
that
he
had
told
it
aloud
it
was
no
proof
of
anything
more
there
remained
the
rapping
and
what
the
medium
had
called
his
appearance
during
the
sleep
but
of
all
this
he
had
read
before
in
books
why
should
he
be
convinced
any
more
now
than
he
had
been
previously
besides
it
was
surely
doubtful
was
it
not
whether
the
rapping
if
it
had
really
taken
place
might
not
be
the
normal
cracks
and
sounds
of
woodwork
intensified
in
the
attention
of
the
listeners
or
if
it
was
more
than
this
was
there
any
proof
that
it
might
not
be
produced
in
some
way
by
the
intense
of
some
living
person
present
this
was
surely
conceivable
more
conceivable
that
is
than
any
other
hypothesis
besides
what
had
it
all
got
to
do
with
amy
within
a
week
of
his
original
experience
skepticism
was
dominant
these
lines
of
thought
did
their
work
by
incessant
repetition
the
normal
life
he
lived
the
large
businesslike
face
of
the
lawyer
whom
he
faced
day
by
day
a
theatre
or
two
a
couple
of
dinners
even
the
noise
of
london
streets
and
the
appearance
of
workaday
persons
all
these
gradually
reassured
him
when
therefore
he
received
a
nervous
little
note
from
lady
laura
reminding
him
of
the
to
be
held
in
baker
street
and
begging
his
attendance
he
wrote
a
most
proper
letter
back
again
thanking
her
for
her
kindness
but
saying
that
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
kind
of
thing
was
not
good
for
him
or
his
work
and
begging
her
to
make
his
excuses
to
vincent
a
week
or
two
passed
and
nothing
whatever
happened
then
he
heard
again
from
lady
laura
and
again
he
answered
by
a
polite
refusal
adding
a
little
more
as
to
his
own
state
of
mind
and
again
silence
fell
then
at
last
vincent
called
on
him
in
person
one
evening
after
dinner
laurie
rooms
were
in
mitre
court
very
convenient
to
the
temple
two
rooms
opening
into
one
another
and
communicating
with
the
staircase
he
had
played
a
little
on
his
grand
piano
that
occupied
a
third
of
his
and
had
then
dropped
off
to
sleep
before
his
fire
he
awakened
suddenly
to
see
the
big
man
standing
almost
over
him
and
sat
up
confusedly
i
beg
your
pardon
baxter
the
porter
boy
told
me
to
come
straight
up
i
found
your
outer
door
open
laurie
hastened
to
welcome
him
to
set
him
down
in
a
deep
chair
to
offer
whisky
and
to
supply
tobacco
there
was
something
about
this
man
that
commanded
deference
you
know
why
i
have
come
i
expect
said
the
medium
smiling
laurie
smiled
back
a
little
nervously
i
have
come
to
see
whether
you
will
not
reconsider
your
decision
the
boy
shook
his
head
i
think
not
he
said
you
found
no
ill
effects
i
hope
from
what
happened
at
lady
laura
not
at
all
after
the
first
shock
does
that
reassure
you
at
all
mr
baxter
laurie
hesitated
it
like
this
he
said
i
not
really
convinced
i
do
see
anything
final
in
what
happened
will
you
explain
please
laurie
set
the
results
of
his
meditations
forth
at
length
there
was
nothing
he
said
that
could
not
be
accounted
for
by
a
very
abnormal
state
of
subjectivity
the
fact
that
this
this
young
person
name
was
in
his
mind
and
so
forth
and
i
find
it
rather
distracting
to
my
work
he
ended
please
do
think
me
rude
or
ungrateful
mr
vincent
he
thought
he
was
being
very
strong
and
sensible
the
medium
was
silent
for
a
moment
does
it
strike
you
as
odd
that
i
myself
was
able
to
get
no
results
that
night
he
said
presently
how
i
do
understand
why
as
a
rule
i
find
no
difficulty
at
all
in
getting
some
sort
of
response
by
automatic
handwriting
are
you
aware
that
i
could
do
nothing
at
all
that
night
laurie
considered
it
well
he
said
at
last
this
may
sound
very
foolish
to
you
but
granting
that
i
have
got
unusual
gifts
that
way
they
are
your
own
words
vincent
if
that
is
so
i
do
see
why
my
own
concentration
of
thought
or
hypnotic
sleep
or
trance
or
whatever
it
was
might
not
have
been
so
intense
as
to
i
quite
see
interrupted
the
other
that
is
of
course
conceivable
from
your
point
of
view
it
had
occurred
to
me
that
you
might
think
that
then
i
take
it
that
your
theory
is
that
the
subconscious
self
is
sufficient
to
account
for
it
all
that
in
this
hypnotic
sleep
if
you
care
to
call
it
so
you
simply
uttered
what
was
in
your
heart
and
identified
yourself
with
with
your
memory
of
that
young
girl
i
suppose
so
said
laurie
shortly
and
the
rapping
loud
continuous
unmistakable
that
does
seem
to
me
important
i
did
not
actually
hear
it
you
know
then
what
you
need
is
some
unmistakable
sign
yes
but
i
see
perfectly
that
this
is
impossible
whatever
i
said
in
my
sleep
either
i
ca
identify
it
as
true
in
which
case
it
is
worthless
as
evidence
or
i
can
identify
it
because
i
already
know
it
and
in
that
case
it
is
worthless
again
the
medium
smiled
half
closing
his
eyes
you
must
think
us
very
childish
baxter
he
said
he
sat
up
a
little
in
his
chair
then
putting
his
hand
into
his
breast
pocket
drew
out
a
holding
it
still
closed
on
his
knee
may
i
ask
you
a
rather
painful
question
he
said
gently
laurie
nodded
he
felt
so
secure
would
you
kindly
tell
me
first
whether
you
have
seen
the
grave
of
this
young
girl
since
you
left
the
country
secondly
whether
anyone
happens
to
have
mentioned
it
to
you
laurie
swallowed
in
his
throat
certainly
no
one
has
mentioned
it
to
me
and
i
have
not
seen
it
since
i
left
the
country
how
long
ago
was
that
that
was
about
september
the
thank
you
he
opened
the
and
turned
the
pages
a
moment
or
two
and
will
you
listen
to
this
mr
baxter
laurie
that
the
ground
has
sunk
a
little
above
my
grave
and
that
cracks
are
showing
at
the
sides
what
is
that
book
said
the
boy
hoarsely
the
medium
closed
it
and
returned
it
to
his
pocket
that
book
baxter
contains
a
few
extracts
from
some
of
the
things
you
said
during
your
trance
the
sentence
i
have
read
is
one
of
them
an
answer
given
to
a
demand
made
by
me
that
the
control
should
give
some
unmistakable
proof
of
her
identity
she
you
hesitated
some
time
before
giving
that
answer
who
took
the
notes
stapleton
you
can
see
the
originals
if
you
wish
i
thought
it
might
distress
you
to
know
that
such
notes
had
been
taken
but
i
have
had
to
risk
that
we
must
not
lose
you
mr
baxter
laurie
sat
dumb
and
bewildered
now
all
you
have
to
do
continued
the
medium
serenely
is
to
find
out
whether
what
has
been
said
is
correct
or
not
if
it
is
not
correct
there
will
be
an
end
of
the
matter
if
you
choose
but
if
it
is
correct
stop
let
me
think
cried
laurie
he
was
back
again
in
the
confusion
from
which
he
thought
he
had
escaped
here
was
a
definite
test
offered
at
least
in
good
faith
just
such
a
test
as
had
been
lacking
before
and
he
had
no
doubt
whatever
that
it
would
be
borne
out
by
facts
and
if
it
were
was
there
any
conceivable
hypothesis
that
would
explain
it
except
the
one
offered
so
confidently
by
this
grave
dignified
man
who
sat
and
looked
at
him
with
something
of
interested
compassion
in
his
heavy
eyes
coincidence
it
was
absurd
certainly
graves
did
sink
sometimes
but
from
someone
who
noticed
the
grave
but
why
that
particular
thought
so
vivid
concise
and
pointed
if
it
were
true
he
looked
hopelessly
at
the
man
who
sat
smoking
quietly
and
waiting
and
then
again
another
thought
previously
ignored
pierced
him
like
a
sword
if
it
were
true
if
amy
herself
poor
pretty
amy
had
indeed
been
there
were
indeed
near
him
now
hammering
and
crying
out
like
a
child
shut
out
at
night
against
his
own
skeptical
heart
if
it
were
indeed
true
that
during
those
two
hours
she
had
had
her
desire
and
had
been
one
with
his
very
soul
in
a
manner
to
which
no
earthly
union
could
aspire
how
had
he
treated
her
even
at
this
thought
a
shudder
of
repulsion
ran
through
him
it
was
unnatural
detestable
yet
how
sweet
what
did
the
church
say
of
such
things
but
what
if
religion
were
wrong
and
this
indeed
were
the
satiety
of
the
higher
nature
of
which
marriage
was
but
the
material
expression
the
thoughts
flew
swifter
than
clouds
as
he
sat
there
bewildering
torturing
beckoning
he
made
a
violent
effort
he
must
be
sane
and
face
things
vincent
he
cried
the
kindly
face
turned
to
him
again
vincent
hush
i
quite
understand
said
the
fatherly
voice
it
is
a
shock
i
know
but
truth
is
a
little
shocking
sometimes
wait
i
perfectly
understand
that
you
must
have
time
you
must
think
it
all
over
and
verify
this
you
must
not
commit
yourself
but
i
think
you
had
better
have
my
address
the
ladies
are
a
little
too
emotional
are
they
not
i
expect
you
would
sooner
come
to
see
me
without
them
he
laid
his
card
on
the
little
and
stood
up
mr
baxter
laurie
took
his
hand
and
looked
for
a
moment
into
the
kind
eyes
then
the
man
was
gone
ii
that
was
a
little
while
ago
now
and
laurie
sitting
over
breakfast
had
had
time
to
think
it
out
and
by
an
act
of
sustained
will
to
suspend
his
judgment
he
had
come
back
again
to
the
state
i
have
described
to
nervous
interest
no
more
than
that
the
terror
seemed
gone
and
certainly
the
skepticism
seemed
gone
too
now
he
had
to
face
maggie
and
his
mother
and
to
see
the
grave
somehow
he
had
become
more
accustomed
to
the
idea
that
there
might
be
real
and
solid
truth
under
it
all
and
familiarity
had
bred
ease
yet
there
was
nervousness
there
too
at
the
thought
of
going
home
there
were
moods
in
which
sitting
or
walking
alone
he
passionately
desired
it
all
to
be
true
other
moods
in
which
he
was
acquiescent
but
in
both
there
was
a
faint
discomfort
in
the
thought
of
meeting
maggie
and
a
certain
instinct
of
propitiation
towards
her
maggie
had
begun
to
stand
for
him
as
a
kind
of
embodiment
of
a
view
of
life
which
was
sane
wholesome
and
curiously
attractive
there
was
a
largeness
about
her
a
strength
a
sense
of
fresh
air
that
was
delightful
it
was
that
kind
of
thing
he
thought
that
had
attracted
him
to
her
during
this
past
summer
the
image
of
amy
on
the
other
hand
more
than
ever
now
since
those
recent
associations
stood
for
something
quite
contrary
certainly
for
attractiveness
but
of
a
feverish
and
vivid
kind
extraordinarily
unlike
the
other
to
express
it
in
terms
of
time
he
thought
of
maggie
in
the
morning
and
of
amy
in
the
evening
particularly
after
dinner
maggie
was
cool
and
sunny
amy
suited
better
the
evening
fever
and
artificial
light
and
now
maggie
had
to
be
faced
first
he
reflected
that
he
had
not
breathed
a
hint
either
to
her
or
his
mother
as
to
what
had
passed
they
both
would
believe
that
he
had
dropped
all
this
there
would
then
be
no
arguing
that
at
least
was
a
comfort
but
there
was
a
curious
sense
of
isolation
and
division
between
him
and
the
girl
yet
after
all
he
asked
himself
indignantly
what
affair
was
it
of
hers
she
was
not
his
confessor
she
was
just
a
girl
who
could
understand
he
would
be
aloof
and
polite
that
was
the
attitude
and
he
would
manage
his
own
affairs
he
drew
a
few
brisk
draughts
of
smoke
from
his
pipe
and
stood
up
that
was
settled
it
was
in
this
determined
mood
then
that
he
stepped
out
on
to
the
platform
at
the
close
of
this
wintry
day
and
saw
maggie
radiant
in
furs
waiting
for
him
with
her
back
to
the
orange
sunset
these
two
did
not
kiss
one
another
it
was
thought
better
not
but
he
took
her
hand
with
a
pleasant
sense
of
welcome
and
auntie
in
the
brougham
she
said
there
lots
of
room
for
the
luggage
on
the
top
oh
laurie
how
jolly
this
is
it
was
a
pleasant
drive
that
they
had
laurie
sat
with
his
back
to
the
horses
his
mother
patted
his
knee
once
or
twice
under
the
fur
rug
and
looked
at
him
with
benevolent
pleasure
it
seemed
at
first
a
very
delightful
baxter
asked
after
morton
laurie
coach
with
proper
deference
but
places
have
as
strong
a
power
of
retaining
associations
as
persons
and
even
as
they
turned
down
into
the
hamlet
laurie
was
aware
that
this
was
particularly
true
just
now
he
carefully
did
not
glance
out
at
nugent
shop
but
it
was
of
no
use
the
whole
place
was
as
full
to
him
of
the
memory
of
amy
and
more
than
the
memory
it
seemed
as
if
she
was
still
alive
they
drew
up
at
the
very
gate
where
he
had
whispered
her
name
the
end
of
the
yew
walk
where
he
had
sat
on
a
certain
night
showed
beyond
the
house
and
half
a
mile
behind
lay
the
meadows
darkling
now
where
he
had
first
met
her
face
to
face
in
the
sunset
and
the
sluice
of
the
stream
where
they
had
stood
together
silent
and
all
was
like
a
landscape
seen
through
colored
paper
by
a
child
it
was
of
the
uniform
tint
of
death
and
sorrow
laurie
was
rather
quiet
all
that
evening
his
mother
noticed
it
and
it
produced
a
remark
from
her
that
for
an
instant
brought
his
heart
into
his
mouth
you
look
a
little
peaked
dearest
she
said
as
she
took
her
bedroom
candlestick
from
him
you
have
been
thinking
any
more
about
that
spiritualism
he
handed
a
candlestick
to
maggie
avoiding
her
eyes
oh
for
a
bit
he
said
lightly
but
i
have
touched
the
thing
for
over
two
months
he
said
it
so
well
that
even
maggie
was
reassured
she
had
just
hesitated
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
to
hear
his
answer
and
she
went
to
bed
well
content
her
contentment
was
even
deeper
next
morning
when
laurie
calling
to
her
through
the
cheerful
frosty
air
made
her
stop
at
the
turning
to
the
village
on
her
way
to
church
i
coming
he
said
virtuously
i
have
been
on
a
weekday
for
ages
they
talked
of
this
and
that
for
the
before
them
at
the
church
door
she
hesitated
again
laurie
i
wish
you
come
to
the
protestant
churchyard
with
me
for
a
moment
afterwards
will
you
he
paled
so
suddenly
that
she
was
startled
why
he
said
shortly
i
want
you
to
see
something
he
looked
at
her
still
for
an
instant
with
an
incomprehensible
expression
then
he
nodded
with
set
lips
when
she
came
out
he
was
waiting
for
her
she
determined
to
say
something
of
regret
laurie
i
dreadfully
sorry
if
i
should
have
said
that
i
was
stupid
but
perhaps
what
is
it
you
want
me
to
see
he
said
without
the
faintest
expression
in
his
voice
just
some
flowers
she
said
you
do
mind
do
you
she
saw
him
trembling
a
little
was
that
all
why
yes
what
else
could
it
be
they
went
on
a
few
steps
without
another
word
at
the
church
gate
he
spoke
again
its
awfully
good
of
you
maggie
i
i
rather
upset
still
you
know
that
all
he
hurried
a
little
in
front
of
her
over
the
frosty
grass
beyond
the
church
and
she
saw
him
looking
at
the
grave
very
earnestly
as
she
came
up
he
said
nothing
for
a
moment
i
afraid
the
monument
rather
rather
awful
do
you
like
the
flowers
laurie
she
was
noticing
that
the
chrysanthemums
were
a
little
blackened
by
the
frost
and
hardly
attended
to
the
fact
that
he
did
not
answer
do
you
like
the
flowers
she
said
again
presently
he
started
from
his
prolonged
stare
downwards
oh
yes
yes
he
said
they
they
lovely
maggie
the
grave
all
right
is
it
the
mound
i
mean
at
first
she
hardly
understood
oh
yes
what
do
you
mean
he
sighed
whether
in
relief
or
not
she
did
not
know
only
only
i
have
heard
of
mounds
sinking
sometimes
or
cracking
at
the
sides
but
this
one
oh
yes
interrupted
the
girl
but
this
was
very
bad
yesterday
what
the
matter
laurie
he
had
turned
his
face
with
some
suddenness
and
there
was
in
it
a
look
of
such
terror
that
she
herself
was
frightened
what
were
you
saying
maggie
it
was
nothing
of
any
importance
said
the
girl
hurriedly
it
was
in
the
least
disfigured
if
that
maggie
will
you
please
tell
me
exactly
in
what
condition
this
grave
was
yesterday
when
was
it
put
right
i
i
noticed
it
when
i
brought
the
chrysanthemums
up
yesterday
morning
the
ground
was
sunk
a
little
and
cracks
were
showing
at
the
sides
i
told
the
sexton
to
put
it
right
he
seems
to
have
done
it
laurie
why
do
you
look
like
that
he
was
staring
at
her
with
an
expression
that
might
have
meant
anything
she
would
not
have
been
surprised
if
he
had
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
it
was
horrible
and
unnatural
laurie
laurie
do
look
like
that
he
turned
suddenly
away
and
left
her
she
hurried
after
him
on
the
way
to
the
house
he
told
her
the
whole
story
from
beginning
to
end
iii
the
two
were
sitting
together
in
the
little
at
the
back
of
the
house
on
the
last
night
of
laurie
holidays
he
was
to
go
back
to
town
next
morning
maggie
had
passed
a
thoroughly
miserable
week
she
had
had
to
keep
her
promise
not
to
tell
baxter
not
that
that
lady
would
have
been
of
much
service
but
the
very
telling
would
be
a
relief
and
things
really
were
not
serious
enough
to
justify
her
telling
father
mahon
to
her
the
misery
lay
not
in
any
belief
she
had
that
the
spiritualistic
claim
was
true
but
that
the
boy
could
be
so
horribly
excited
by
it
she
had
gone
over
the
arguments
again
and
again
with
him
approving
heartily
of
his
suggestions
as
to
the
earlier
part
of
the
story
and
suggesting
herself
what
seemed
to
her
the
most
sensible
explanation
of
the
final
detail
graves
did
sink
she
said
in
two
cases
out
of
three
and
laurie
was
as
aware
of
that
as
herself
why
in
the
world
should
not
this
then
be
attributed
to
the
same
subconscious
mind
as
that
which
in
the
hypnotic
sleep
or
whatever
it
was
had
given
voice
to
the
rest
of
his
imaginations
laurie
had
shaken
his
head
now
they
were
at
it
once
more
baxter
had
gone
to
bed
half
an
hour
before
it
too
wickedly
grotesque
she
said
indignantly
you
seriously
believe
that
poor
amy
soul
entered
into
your
mind
for
an
hour
and
a
half
in
lady
laura
why
what
purgatory
then
or
heaven
it
so
utterly
and
ridiculously
impossible
that
i
ca
speak
of
it
with
patience
laurie
smiled
at
her
rather
wearily
and
contemptuously
the
point
he
said
is
this
which
is
the
simplest
hypothesis
you
and
i
both
believe
that
the
soul
is
somewhere
and
it
natural
it
that
she
should
want
oh
dash
it
all
maggie
i
think
you
should
remember
that
she
was
in
love
with
me
as
well
as
i
with
her
he
added
maggie
made
a
tiny
mental
note
i
do
deny
for
an
instant
that
it
a
very
odd
story
she
said
but
this
kind
of
explanation
is
just
oh
i
ca
speak
of
it
you
allowed
yourself
that
up
to
this
last
thing
you
did
really
believe
it
and
now
because
of
this
coincidence
the
whole
turned
upside
down
laurie
i
wish
you
be
reasonable
laurie
glanced
at
her
she
was
sitting
with
her
back
to
the
curtained
and
shuttered
window
beyond
which
lay
the
and
the
lamplight
from
the
tall
stand
fell
full
upon
her
she
was
dressed
in
some
rich
darkish
material
her
breast
veiled
in
filmy
white
stuff
and
her
round
strong
arms
lay
bare
to
the
elbow
along
the
arms
of
her
chair
she
was
a
very
pleasant
wholesome
sight
but
her
face
was
troubled
and
her
great
serene
eyes
were
not
so
serene
as
usual
he
was
astonished
at
the
persistence
with
which
she
attacked
him
her
whole
personality
seemed
thrown
into
her
eyes
and
gestures
and
quick
words
maggie
he
said
please
listen
i
told
you
again
and
again
that
i
not
actually
convinced
what
you
say
is
just
conceivably
possible
but
it
does
seem
to
me
to
be
the
most
natural
explanation
the
most
natural
seems
to
me
to
be
what
i
have
said
and
you
quite
right
in
saying
that
it
this
last
thing
that
has
made
the
difference
exactly
like
the
grain
that
turns
the
whole
bottle
into
solid
salt
it
needed
that
but
as
i
said
i
ca
be
actually
and
finally
convinced
until
i
seen
more
i
going
to
see
more
i
wrote
to
vincent
this
morning
you
did
cried
the
girl
do
be
silly
please
yes
i
did
i
told
him
i
be
at
his
service
when
i
came
back
to
london
not
to
have
done
that
would
have
been
cowardly
and
absurd
i
owe
him
that
laurie
i
wish
you
would
said
the
girl
pleadingly
he
sat
up
a
little
disturbed
by
this
very
unusual
air
of
hers
but
if
it
all
such
nonsense
he
said
what
there
to
be
afraid
of
it
it
morbid
said
maggie
morbid
and
horrible
of
course
nonsense
but
it
it
wicked
nonsense
laurie
flushed
a
little
you
polite
he
said
i
sorry
she
said
penitently
but
you
know
really
the
boy
suddenly
blazed
up
a
little
you
seem
to
think
i
got
no
heart
he
cried
suppose
it
was
true
suppose
really
and
truly
amy
was
here
and
a
sudden
clear
sharp
sound
like
the
crack
of
a
whip
sounded
from
the
corner
of
the
room
even
maggie
started
and
glanced
at
the
boy
he
was
dead
white
on
the
instant
his
lips
were
trembling
what
was
that
he
whispered
sharp
and
loud
just
the
woodwork
she
said
tranquilly
the
thaw
has
set
in
tonight
laurie
looked
at
her
his
lips
still
moved
nervously
but
but
he
began
dear
boy
do
you
see
the
state
of
nerves
again
came
the
little
sharp
crack
and
she
stopped
for
an
instant
she
was
disturbed
certain
possibilities
opened
before
her
and
she
regarded
them
then
she
crushed
them
down
impatiently
and
half
timorously
she
stood
up
abruptly
i
going
to
bed
she
said
this
is
too
ridiculous
no
no
do
leave
me
maggie
i
do
like
it
she
sat
down
again
wondering
at
his
childishness
and
yet
conscious
that
her
own
nerves
too
were
ever
so
slightly
on
edge
she
would
not
look
at
him
for
fear
that
the
meeting
of
eyes
might
hint
at
more
than
she
meant
she
threw
her
head
back
on
her
chair
and
remained
looking
at
the
ceiling
but
to
think
that
the
souls
of
the
dead
ah
how
repulsive
outside
the
night
was
very
still
the
hard
frost
had
kept
the
world
in
a
sprinkle
of
snow
during
the
last
two
or
three
days
but
this
afternoon
the
thaw
had
begun
twice
during
dinner
there
had
come
the
thud
of
masses
of
snow
falling
from
the
roof
on
to
the
lawn
outside
and
the
clear
sparkle
of
the
candles
had
seemed
a
little
dim
and
hazy
it
would
be
a
comfort
to
get
at
the
garden
again
she
had
reflected
and
now
that
the
two
sat
here
in
the
windless
silence
the
thaw
became
more
apparent
every
instant
the
silence
was
profound
and
the
little
noises
of
the
night
outside
the
drip
from
the
eaves
slow
and
deliberate
the
rustle
of
released
leaves
and
even
the
gentle
thud
on
the
lawn
from
the
yew
branches
all
these
helped
to
emphasize
the
stillness
it
was
not
like
the
murmur
of
day
it
was
rather
like
the
gnawing
of
a
mouse
in
the
wainscot
of
some
death
chamber
it
requires
almost
superhumanly
strong
nerves
to
sit
at
night
after
a
conversation
of
this
kind
opposite
an
apparently
reasonable
person
who
is
white
and
twitching
with
terror
even
though
one
resolutely
refrains
from
looking
at
him
without
being
slightly
affected
one
may
argue
with
oneself
to
any
extent
tap
one
foot
cheerfully
on
the
floor
fill
the
mind
most
painstakingly
with
normal
thoughts
yet
it
is
something
of
a
conflict
however
victorious
one
may
be
even
maggie
herself
became
aware
of
this
it
was
not
that
now
for
one
single
moment
she
allowed
that
the
two
little
sudden
noises
in
the
room
could
possibly
proceed
from
any
cause
whatever
except
that
which
she
had
stated
the
relaxation
of
stiffened
wood
under
the
influence
of
the
thaw
nor
had
all
laurie
arguments
prevailed
to
shake
in
the
smallest
degree
her
resolute
conviction
that
there
was
nothing
whatever
preternatural
in
his
certainly
queer
story
yet
as
she
sat
there
in
the
lamplight
with
laurie
speechless
before
her
and
the
great
curtained
window
behind
she
became
conscious
of
an
uneasiness
that
she
could
not
entirely
repel
it
was
just
physical
she
said
it
was
the
result
of
the
change
of
weather
or
at
the
most
it
was
the
silence
that
had
now
fallen
and
the
proximity
of
a
terrified
boy
she
looked
across
at
him
again
he
was
lying
back
in
the
old
green
his
eyes
rather
shadowed
from
the
lamp
overhead
quite
still
and
quiet
his
hands
still
clasping
the
lion
bosses
of
his
beside
him
on
the
little
table
lay
his
still
smoldering
in
the
silver
tray
maggie
suddenly
sprang
to
her
feet
slipped
round
the
table
and
caught
him
by
the
arm
laurie
laurie
wake
up
what
the
matter
a
long
shudder
passed
through
him
he
sat
up
with
a
bewildered
look
eh
what
is
it
he
said
was
i
asleep
he
rubbed
his
hands
over
his
eyes
and
looked
round
what
is
it
maggie
was
i
asleep
was
the
boy
acting
surely
it
was
good
acting
maggie
threw
herself
down
on
her
knees
by
the
chair
laurie
laurie
i
beg
you
not
to
go
to
see
vincent
it
bad
for
you
i
do
wish
you
would
he
still
blinked
at
her
a
moment
i
do
understand
what
do
you
mean
maggie
she
stood
up
ashamed
of
her
impulsiveness
only
i
wish
you
would
go
and
see
that
man
laurie
please
do
he
stood
up
too
stretching
every
sign
of
nervousness
seemed
gone
not
see
vincent
nonsense
of
course
i
shall
you
understand
maggie
i
what
a
relief
sighed
stapleton
i
thought
we
had
lost
him
the
three
were
sitting
once
again
in
lady
laura
soon
after
lunch
vincent
had
just
looked
in
with
laurie
note
to
give
the
news
it
was
a
heavy
fog
outside
woolly
in
texture
and
orange
in
color
and
the
tall
windows
seemed
opaque
in
the
lamplight
the
room
by
contrast
appeared
a
safe
and
pleasant
refuge
from
the
reek
and
stinging
vapor
of
the
street
stapleton
had
been
lunching
with
her
friend
the
colonel
had
returned
for
christmas
so
his
wife
duties
had
recalled
her
for
the
present
from
those
spiritual
conversations
which
she
had
enjoyed
in
the
autumn
it
was
such
a
refreshment
she
had
said
with
a
patient
smile
to
slip
away
sometimes
into
the
purer
atmosphere
vincent
folded
the
letter
and
restored
it
to
his
pocket
we
must
be
careful
with
him
he
said
he
is
extraordinarily
sensitive
i
almost
wish
he
were
not
so
developed
temperaments
like
his
are
apt
to
be
thrown
off
their
balance
lady
laura
was
silent
for
herself
she
was
not
perfectly
happy
she
had
lately
come
across
one
or
two
rather
deplorable
cases
a
very
promising
girl
daughter
of
a
publican
in
the
suburbs
had
developed
the
same
kind
of
powers
and
the
end
of
it
all
had
been
rather
a
dreadful
scene
in
baker
street
she
was
now
in
an
asylum
a
friend
of
her
own
too
had
lately
taken
to
lecturing
against
christianity
in
rather
painful
terms
lady
laura
wondered
why
people
could
not
be
as
well
balanced
as
herself
i
think
he
had
better
not
come
to
the
public
at
present
went
on
the
medium
that
no
doubt
will
come
later
but
i
was
going
to
ask
a
great
favor
from
you
lady
laura
she
looked
up
that
bother
about
the
rooms
is
not
yet
settled
and
the
sunday
will
have
to
cease
for
the
present
i
wonder
if
you
would
let
us
come
here
just
a
few
of
us
only
for
three
or
four
sundays
at
any
rate
she
brightened
up
why
it
would
be
the
greatest
pleasure
she
said
but
what
about
the
cabinet
if
necessary
i
would
send
one
across
will
you
allow
me
to
make
arrangements
stapleton
beamed
what
a
privilege
she
said
dearest
i
quite
envy
you
i
am
afraid
dear
tom
would
never
consent
there
are
just
one
or
two
things
on
my
mind
went
on
vincent
so
pleasantly
that
the
interruption
seemed
almost
a
compliment
and
the
first
is
this
i
want
him
to
see
for
himself
of
course
for
ourselves
his
trance
is
the
point
but
hardly
for
him
he
is
tremendously
impressed
i
can
see
that
though
he
pretends
not
to
be
but
i
should
like
him
to
see
something
unmistakable
as
soon
as
possible
we
must
prevent
his
going
into
trance
if
possible
and
the
next
thing
is
his
religion
catholics
are
supposed
not
to
come
observed
stapleton
just
so
baxter
is
a
convert
is
he
i
thought
so
he
mused
for
a
moment
or
two
the
ladies
had
never
seen
him
so
interested
in
an
amateur
usually
his
manner
was
remarkable
for
its
detachment
and
severe
assurance
but
it
seemed
that
this
case
excited
even
him
lady
laura
was
filled
again
with
sudden
compunction
vincent
she
said
do
you
really
think
there
is
no
danger
for
this
boy
he
glanced
up
at
her
there
is
always
danger
he
said
we
know
that
well
enough
we
can
but
take
precautions
but
pioneers
always
have
to
risk
something
she
was
not
reassured
but
i
mean
special
danger
he
is
extraordinarily
sensitive
you
know
there
was
that
girl
from
surbiton
oh
she
was
exceptionally
hysterical
baxter
not
like
that
i
do
not
see
that
he
runs
any
greater
risk
than
we
run
ourselves
you
are
sure
of
that
he
smiled
deprecatingly
i
am
sure
of
nothing
he
said
but
if
you
feel
you
would
sooner
not
stapleton
rustled
excitedly
and
lady
laura
grabbed
at
her
retreating
opportunity
no
no
she
cried
i
did
mean
that
for
one
moment
please
please
come
here
i
only
wondered
whether
there
was
any
particular
precaution
i
will
think
about
it
said
the
medium
but
i
am
sure
we
must
be
careful
not
to
shock
him
of
course
we
do
all
take
the
same
view
about
religion
but
we
can
leave
that
for
the
present
the
point
is
that
baxter
should
if
possible
see
something
unmistakable
the
rest
can
take
care
of
itself
then
if
you
consent
lady
laura
we
might
have
a
little
sitting
here
next
sunday
night
would
nine
suit
you
he
glanced
at
the
two
ladies
that
will
do
very
well
said
the
mistress
of
the
house
and
about
preparations
i
will
look
in
on
saturday
afternoon
is
there
anyone
particular
you
think
of
asking
jamieson
came
to
see
me
again
a
few
days
ago
suggested
lady
laura
tentatively
that
will
do
very
well
then
we
three
and
those
two
that
will
be
quite
enough
for
the
present
he
stood
up
a
big
dominating
figure
a
reassuring
man
to
look
at
with
his
kindly
face
his
bushy
square
beard
and
his
appearance
of
physical
strength
lady
laura
sat
vaguely
comforted
and
about
my
notes
asked
maud
stapleton
i
think
they
will
not
be
necessary
saturday
afternoon
the
two
sat
on
silently
for
a
minute
or
two
after
he
was
gone
what
is
the
matter
dearest
lady
laura
little
anxious
face
did
not
move
she
was
staring
thoughtfully
at
the
fire
stapleton
laid
a
sympathetic
hand
on
the
other
knee
dearest
she
began
no
it
is
nothing
darling
said
lady
laura
meanwhile
the
medium
was
picking
his
way
through
the
foggy
streets
figures
loomed
up
sudden
and
enormous
and
vanished
again
smoky
flares
of
flame
shone
like
spots
of
painted
fire
bright
and
unpenetrating
from
windows
overhead
and
sounds
came
to
him
through
the
woolly
atmosphere
dulled
and
sonorous
it
would
so
to
speak
have
been
a
suitably
dramatic
setting
for
his
thoughts
if
he
had
been
thinking
in
character
vaguely
suggestive
of
presences
and
hints
and
peeps
into
the
unknown
but
he
was
a
very
practical
man
his
spiritualistic
faith
was
a
reality
to
him
as
unexciting
as
christianity
to
the
normal
christian
he
entertained
no
manner
of
doubt
as
to
its
truth
beyond
all
the
fraud
the
the
amazing
feats
of
the
subconscious
self
there
remained
certain
facts
beyond
doubting
facts
which
required
he
believed
an
objective
explanation
which
none
but
the
spiritualistic
thesis
offered
he
had
far
more
evidence
he
considered
sincerely
enough
for
his
spiritualism
than
most
christians
for
their
christianity
he
had
no
very
definite
theory
as
to
the
spiritual
world
beyond
thinking
that
it
was
rather
like
this
world
for
him
it
was
peopled
with
individualities
of
various
characters
and
temperaments
of
various
grades
and
achievements
and
of
these
a
certain
number
had
the
power
of
communicating
under
great
difficulties
with
persons
on
this
side
who
were
capable
of
receiving
such
communications
that
there
were
dangers
connected
with
this
process
he
was
well
aware
he
had
seen
often
enough
the
moral
sense
vanish
and
the
mental
powers
decay
but
these
were
to
him
no
more
than
the
honorable
wounds
to
which
all
who
struggle
are
liable
the
point
for
him
was
that
here
lay
the
one
certain
means
of
getting
into
touch
with
reality
certainly
that
reality
was
sometimes
of
a
disconcerting
nature
and
seldom
of
an
illuminating
one
he
hated
as
much
as
anyone
the
tambourine
business
except
so
far
as
it
was
essential
and
he
deplored
the
fact
that
as
he
believed
it
was
often
the
most
degraded
and
the
least
satisfactory
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
other
world
that
most
easily
got
into
touch
with
the
inhabitants
of
this
yet
for
him
the
main
tenets
of
spiritualism
were
as
the
bones
of
the
universe
it
was
the
only
religion
which
seemed
to
him
in
the
least
worthy
of
serious
attention
he
had
not
practiced
as
a
medium
for
longer
than
ten
or
a
dozen
years
he
had
discovered
by
chance
as
he
thought
that
he
possessed
mediumistic
powers
in
an
unusual
degree
and
had
begun
then
to
take
up
the
life
as
a
profession
he
had
suffered
so
far
as
he
was
aware
no
ill
effects
from
this
life
though
he
had
seen
others
suffer
and
as
his
fame
grew
his
income
grew
with
it
it
is
necessary
then
to
understand
that
he
was
not
a
conscious
charlatan
he
loathed
mechanical
tricks
such
as
he
occasionally
came
across
he
was
perfectly
and
serenely
convinced
that
the
powers
which
he
possessed
were
genuine
and
that
the
personages
he
seemed
to
come
across
in
his
mediumistic
efforts
were
what
they
professed
to
be
that
they
were
not
hallucinatory
that
they
were
not
the
products
of
fraud
that
they
were
not
necessarily
evil
he
regarded
this
religion
as
he
regarded
science
both
were
progressive
both
liable
to
error
both
capable
of
abuse
yet
as
a
scientist
did
not
shrink
from
experiment
for
fear
of
risk
neither
must
the
spiritualist
as
he
picked
his
way
to
his
lodgings
on
the
north
of
the
park
he
was
thinking
about
laurie
baxter
that
this
boy
possessed
in
an
unusual
degree
what
he
would
have
called
occult
powers
was
very
evident
to
him
that
these
powers
involved
a
certain
risk
was
evident
too
he
proposed
therefore
to
take
all
reasonable
precautions
all
the
catastrophes
he
had
witnessed
in
the
past
were
due
he
thought
to
a
too
rapid
development
of
those
powers
or
to
inexperience
he
determined
therefore
to
go
slowly
first
the
boy
must
be
convinced
next
he
must
be
attached
to
the
cause
thirdly
his
religion
must
be
knocked
out
of
him
fourthly
he
must
be
trained
and
developed
but
for
the
present
he
must
not
be
allowed
to
go
into
trance
if
it
could
be
prevented
it
was
plain
he
thought
that
laurie
had
a
very
strong
affinity
as
he
would
have
said
with
the
disembodied
spirit
of
a
certain
amy
nugent
his
communication
with
her
had
been
of
a
very
startling
nature
in
its
rapidity
and
perfection
real
progress
might
be
made
then
through
this
channel
yes
i
am
aware
that
this
sounds
grotesque
nonsense
ii
laurie
came
back
to
town
in
a
condition
of
interior
quietness
that
rather
astonished
him
he
had
said
to
maggie
that
he
was
not
convinced
and
that
was
true
so
far
as
he
knew
intellectually
the
spiritualistic
theory
was
at
present
only
the
hypothesis
that
seemed
the
most
reasonable
yet
morally
he
was
as
convinced
of
its
truth
as
of
anything
in
the
world
and
this
showed
itself
by
the
quietness
in
which
he
found
his
soul
plunged
moral
conviction
that
conviction
on
which
a
man
acts
does
not
always
coincide
with
the
intellectual
process
occasionally
it
outruns
it
occasionally
lags
behind
and
the
first
sign
of
its
arrival
is
the
cessation
of
strain
the
intellect
may
still
be
busy
arranging
sorting
and
classifying
but
the
thing
itself
is
done
and
the
soul
leans
back
a
certain
amount
of
excitement
made
itself
felt
when
he
found
vincent
letter
waiting
for
his
arrival
to
congratulate
him
on
his
decision
and
to
beg
him
to
be
at
queen
gate
not
later
than
eight
on
the
following
sunday
but
it
was
not
more
than
momentary
he
knew
the
thing
to
be
inevitably
true
now
the
time
and
place
at
which
it
manifested
itself
was
not
supremely
important
yes
he
wrote
in
answer
he
would
certainly
keep
the
appointment
suggested
he
dined
out
at
a
restaurant
returned
to
his
rooms
and
sat
down
to
arrange
his
ideas
these
to
be
frank
were
not
very
many
nor
very
profound
he
had
already
in
the
days
that
had
passed
since
his
shock
no
lighter
because
expected
when
he
had
learned
from
maggie
that
the
test
was
fulfilled
and
that
a
fact
known
to
no
one
present
not
even
himself
in
queen
gate
had
been
communicated
through
his
lips
since
that
time
the
idea
had
become
familiar
that
the
veil
between
this
world
and
the
next
was
a
very
thin
one
after
all
a
large
number
of
persons
in
the
world
believe
that
as
it
is
and
they
are
not
in
consequence
in
a
continuous
state
of
exaltation
laurie
had
learned
this
he
thought
experimentally
very
well
then
that
was
so
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
next
the
excitement
of
the
thought
of
communicating
with
amy
in
particular
had
to
a
large
extent
burned
itself
out
it
was
nearly
four
months
since
her
death
and
in
his
very
heart
of
hearts
he
was
beginning
to
be
aware
that
she
had
not
been
so
entirely
his
as
he
would
still
have
maintained
he
had
reflected
a
little
in
the
meantime
upon
the
grocer
shop
the
dissenting
the
odor
of
cheeses
certainly
these
things
could
not
destroy
an
affinity
if
the
affinity
were
robust
but
it
would
need
to
be
he
was
still
very
tender
towards
the
thought
of
her
she
had
gained
too
inevitably
by
dying
a
dignity
she
had
lacked
while
living
and
it
might
well
be
that
intercourse
with
her
in
the
manner
proposed
would
be
an
extraordinarily
sweet
experience
but
he
was
no
longer
excited
passionately
and
overwhelmingly
by
the
prospect
it
would
be
delightful
yes
but
then
laurie
began
to
look
at
his
religion
and
at
that
view
he
stopped
dead
he
had
no
ideas
at
all
on
the
subject
he
had
not
a
notion
where
he
stood
all
he
knew
was
that
it
had
become
uninteresting
true
oh
yes
he
supposed
so
he
retained
it
still
as
many
retain
faith
in
the
supernatural
a
reserve
that
could
be
drawn
upon
in
extremities
he
had
not
yet
missed
hearing
mass
on
sunday
in
fact
he
proposed
to
go
even
next
sunday
a
man
must
have
a
religion
he
said
to
himself
and
intellectually
there
was
at
present
no
other
possible
religion
for
him
except
the
catholic
yet
as
he
looked
into
the
future
he
was
doubtful
he
drew
himself
up
in
his
chair
and
began
to
fill
his
pipe
in
three
days
he
would
be
seated
in
a
room
with
three
or
four
persons
he
supposed
of
these
two
and
certainly
the
two
strongest
characters
had
no
religion
except
that
supplied
by
spiritualism
and
he
had
read
enough
to
know
this
was
at
any
rate
in
the
long
run
and
these
three
or
four
persons
moreover
believed
with
their
whole
hearts
that
they
were
in
relations
with
the
invisible
world
far
more
evident
and
sensible
than
those
claimed
by
any
other
believers
on
the
face
of
the
earth
and
after
all
laurie
reflected
there
seemed
to
be
justice
in
their
claim
he
would
be
seated
in
that
room
he
repeated
to
himself
and
it
might
be
that
before
he
left
it
he
would
have
seen
with
his
own
eyes
and
possibly
handled
living
persons
who
had
in
the
common
phrase
died
and
been
buried
almost
certainly
at
the
very
least
he
would
have
received
from
such
intelligences
unmistakable
messages
he
was
astonished
that
he
was
not
more
excited
he
asked
himself
again
whether
he
really
believed
it
he
compared
his
belief
in
it
with
his
belief
in
the
existence
of
new
zealand
yes
if
that
were
belief
he
had
it
but
the
excitement
of
doubt
was
gone
as
no
doubt
it
was
gone
when
new
zealand
became
a
geographical
expression
he
was
astonished
at
its
naturalness
at
the
extraordinary
manner
in
which
when
once
the
evidence
had
been
seen
and
the
point
of
view
grasped
the
whole
thing
fell
into
place
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
must
have
known
it
all
his
life
yet
he
knew
six
months
ago
he
had
hardly
known
more
than
that
there
were
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
persons
called
spiritualists
who
believed
or
pretended
to
believe
what
he
then
was
quite
sure
was
fantastic
nonsense
and
now
he
was
to
all
intents
one
of
them
he
was
being
drawn
forward
it
seemed
by
a
process
as
inevitable
as
that
of
spring
or
autumn
and
once
he
had
yielded
to
it
the
conflict
and
the
excitement
were
over
certainly
this
made
very
few
demands
christianity
said
that
those
were
blessed
who
had
not
seen
and
yet
believed
spiritualism
said
that
the
only
reasonable
belief
was
that
which
followed
seeing
so
then
laurie
sat
and
meditated
once
or
twice
that
evening
he
looked
round
him
tranquilly
without
a
touch
of
that
terror
that
had
seized
him
in
the
at
home
if
all
this
were
true
and
he
repeated
to
himself
that
he
knew
it
was
true
these
presences
were
about
him
now
so
why
was
it
that
he
was
no
longer
frightened
he
looked
carefully
into
the
dark
corner
behind
him
beyond
the
low
jutting
bookshelf
in
the
angle
between
the
curtained
windows
at
his
piano
glossy
and
mysterious
in
the
gloom
at
the
door
into
his
bedroom
all
was
quiet
here
shut
off
from
the
hum
of
fleet
street
circumstances
were
propitious
why
was
he
not
frightened
why
what
was
there
to
frighten
him
these
presences
were
natural
and
normal
even
as
a
catholic
he
believed
in
them
and
if
they
manifested
themselves
what
was
there
to
fear
in
that
he
looked
steadily
and
serenely
and
as
he
looked
like
the
kindling
of
a
fire
there
rose
within
him
a
sense
of
strange
exaltation
amy
he
whispered
but
there
was
no
movement
or
hint
laurie
smiled
a
little
wearily
he
felt
tired
he
would
sleep
a
little
he
beat
out
his
pipe
crossed
his
feet
before
the
fire
and
closed
his
eyes
iii
there
followed
that
smooth
rush
into
gulfs
of
sleep
that
provides
perhaps
the
most
exquisite
physical
sensation
known
to
man
as
the
veils
fall
thicker
and
softer
every
instant
and
the
consciousness
gathers
itself
inwards
from
hands
and
feet
and
limbs
like
a
dog
curling
himself
up
for
rest
yet
retains
itself
in
continuous
being
and
is
able
to
regard
its
own
comfort
all
this
he
remembered
perfectly
half
an
hour
later
but
there
followed
in
his
memory
that
inevitable
gap
in
which
self
loses
itself
before
emerging
into
the
phantom
land
of
dreams
or
returning
to
reality
but
that
into
which
he
emerged
he
remembered
afterwards
was
a
different
realm
altogether
from
that
which
is
usual
from
that
country
of
grotesque
fancy
and
jumbled
thoughts
of
thin
shadows
of
truth
and
echoes
from
the
common
world
where
most
of
us
find
ourselves
in
sleep
his
dream
was
as
follows
he
was
still
in
his
room
he
thought
but
no
longer
in
his
chair
instead
he
stood
in
the
very
center
of
the
floor
or
at
least
poised
somewhere
above
it
for
he
could
see
at
a
glance
without
turning
all
that
the
room
contained
he
directed
his
attention
for
it
was
this
rather
than
sight
through
which
he
perceived
to
the
piano
the
chiffonier
the
chairs
the
two
doors
the
curtained
windows
and
finally
with
scarcely
even
a
touch
of
surprise
to
himself
still
sunk
in
the
chair
before
the
fire
he
regarded
himself
with
pleased
interest
remembering
even
in
that
instant
that
he
had
never
before
seen
himself
with
closed
eyes
all
in
the
room
was
extraordinarily
vivid
and
it
was
true
that
the
firelight
still
wavered
and
sank
again
in
billows
of
soft
color
about
the
shadowed
walls
but
the
changing
light
was
no
more
an
interruption
to
the
action
of
that
steady
medium
through
which
he
perceived
than
the
movement
of
summer
clouds
across
the
full
sunlight
it
was
at
that
moment
that
he
understood
that
he
saw
no
longer
with
eyes
but
with
that
faculty
of
perception
to
which
sight
is
only
analogous
that
faculty
which
underlies
and
is
common
to
all
the
senses
alike
his
reasoning
powers
too
at
this
moment
seemed
to
have
gone
from
him
like
a
husk
he
did
not
argue
or
deduce
simply
he
understood
and
in
a
flash
simultaneous
with
the
whole
vision
he
perceived
that
he
was
behind
all
the
slow
processes
of
the
world
by
which
this
is
added
to
that
and
a
conclusion
drawn
by
which
light
travels
and
sounds
resolve
themselves
and
emotions
run
their
course
he
had
reached
he
thought
the
ultimate
secret
it
was
this
that
lay
behind
everything
now
it
is
impossible
to
set
down
except
progressively
all
this
sum
of
experiences
that
occupied
for
him
one
interminable
instant
neither
did
he
remember
afterwards
the
order
in
which
they
presented
themselves
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
no
order
all
was
simultaneous
but
he
understood
plainly
by
intuition
that
all
was
open
to
him
space
no
longer
existed
for
him
nothing
to
his
perception
separated
this
from
that
he
was
able
he
saw
without
stirring
from
his
attitude
to
see
in
an
instant
any
place
or
person
towards
which
he
chose
to
exercise
his
attention
it
seemed
a
marvelously
simple
point
this
that
space
was
little
more
than
an
illusion
that
it
was
after
all
nothing
else
but
a
translation
into
rather
coarse
terms
of
what
may
be
called
differences
here
and
there
were
but
relative
terms
certainly
they
corresponded
to
facts
but
they
were
not
those
facts
themselves
and
since
he
now
stood
behind
them
he
saw
them
on
their
inner
side
as
a
man
standing
in
the
interior
of
a
globe
may
be
said
to
be
equally
present
to
every
point
upon
its
surface
the
fascination
of
the
thought
was
enormous
and
like
a
child
who
begins
to
take
notice
and
to
learn
the
laws
of
extension
and
distance
so
he
began
to
learn
their
reverse
he
saw
he
thought
as
he
had
seen
once
before
only
this
time
without
the
sense
of
movement
the
interior
of
the
lighted
drawing
room
at
home
and
his
mother
nodding
in
her
chair
he
directed
his
attention
to
maggie
and
perceived
her
passing
across
the
landing
toward
the
head
of
the
stairs
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
it
was
this
sight
that
brought
him
to
a
further
discovery
to
the
effect
that
time
also
was
of
very
nearly
no
importance
either
for
he
perceived
that
by
bending
his
attention
upon
her
he
could
restrain
her
so
to
speak
in
her
movement
there
she
stood
one
foot
outstretched
the
candle
flame
leaning
motionless
backward
and
he
knew
too
that
it
was
not
she
who
was
thus
restrained
but
that
it
was
the
intensity
and
directness
of
his
thought
that
fixed
so
to
say
in
terms
of
eternity
that
instant
of
time
so
it
went
on
or
rather
so
it
was
with
him
he
pleased
himself
by
contemplating
the
london
streets
outside
the
darkness
of
the
garden
in
some
square
the
interior
of
the
oratory
where
a
few
figures
kneeled
all
seen
beyond
the
movements
of
light
and
shadow
in
this
clear
invisible
radiance
that
was
to
his
perception
as
common
light
to
common
eyes
the
world
of
which
he
had
had
experience
for
he
found
himself
unable
to
see
that
which
he
had
never
experienced
lay
before
his
will
like
a
movable
map
this
or
that
person
or
place
had
but
to
be
desired
and
it
was
present
and
then
came
the
return
and
the
horror
he
began
in
this
way
he
understood
that
he
wished
to
awake
or
rather
to
be
reunited
with
the
body
that
lay
there
in
deep
sleep
before
the
fire
he
observed
it
for
a
moment
or
two
interested
and
pleased
the
face
sunk
a
little
on
the
hand
the
feet
lightly
crossed
on
the
fender
he
looked
at
his
own
profile
the
straight
nose
the
parted
lips
through
which
the
breath
came
evenly
he
attempted
even
to
touch
the
face
wondering
with
gentle
pleasure
what
would
be
the
result
then
suddenly
an
impulse
came
to
him
to
enter
the
body
and
with
the
impulse
the
process
it
seemed
began
that
process
was
not
unlike
that
of
falling
asleep
in
an
instant
perception
was
gone
the
lighted
room
was
gone
and
that
obedient
world
which
he
had
contemplated
just
now
yet
for
a
while
remained
he
still
had
the
power
of
perceiving
his
own
personality
though
this
dwindled
every
moment
down
to
that
same
gulf
of
nothingness
through
which
he
had
found
his
way
but
at
the
very
instant
in
which
consciousness
was
passing
there
met
him
an
emotion
so
fierce
and
overwhelming
that
he
recoiled
in
terror
back
from
the
body
once
more
and
and
a
panic
seized
him
it
was
such
a
panic
as
seizes
a
child
who
fearfully
courageous
has
stolen
at
night
from
his
room
and
turning
in
terror
finds
the
door
fast
against
him
or
is
aware
of
a
malignant
presence
come
suddenly
into
being
standing
between
himself
and
the
safety
of
his
own
bed
on
the
one
side
his
fear
drove
him
onwards
on
the
other
a
horror
faced
him
he
dared
not
recoil
for
he
understood
where
security
lay
he
longed
like
the
child
screaming
in
the
dark
and
beating
his
hands
to
get
back
to
the
warmth
and
safety
of
bed
yet
there
stood
before
him
a
presence
or
at
the
least
an
emotion
of
some
kind
so
hostile
so
terrible
that
he
dared
not
penetrate
it
it
was
not
that
an
actual
restraint
lay
upon
him
he
knew
that
is
that
the
door
was
open
yet
it
needed
an
effort
of
the
will
of
which
his
paralysis
of
terror
rendered
him
incapable
the
tension
became
intolerable
o
god
god
god
he
cried
and
in
an
instant
the
threshold
was
vacated
the
swift
rush
asserted
itself
and
the
space
was
passed
laurie
sat
up
abruptly
in
his
chair
iv
vincent
was
beginning
to
think
about
going
to
bed
he
had
come
in
an
hour
before
had
written
half
a
dozen
letters
and
was
smoking
peacefully
before
the
fire
his
rooms
were
not
remarkable
in
any
way
except
for
half
a
dozen
objects
standing
on
the
second
shelf
of
his
bookcase
and
the
selection
of
literature
ranged
below
them
for
the
rest
all
was
commonplace
enough
a
mahogany
table
a
couple
of
easy
chairs
much
worn
and
a
long
extremely
comfortable
sofa
standing
by
itself
against
the
wall
with
evident
signs
in
its
tumbled
cushions
and
rubbed
fabric
of
continual
and
frequent
use
a
second
door
gave
entrance
to
his
bedroom
he
beat
out
his
pipe
slowly
yawned
and
stood
up
it
was
at
this
instant
that
he
heard
the
sudden
tinkle
of
the
electric
bell
in
the
lobby
outside
and
wondering
at
the
interruption
at
this
hour
went
quickly
out
and
opened
the
door
on
to
the
stairs
baxter
come
in
come
in
i
delighted
to
see
you
laurie
came
in
without
a
word
went
straight
up
to
the
and
faced
about
i
not
going
to
apologize
he
said
for
coming
at
this
time
you
told
me
to
come
and
see
you
at
any
time
and
i
taken
you
at
your
word
the
young
man
had
an
odd
embarrassed
manner
thought
the
other
an
air
of
having
come
in
spite
of
uneasiness
he
was
almost
shamefaced
the
medium
impelled
him
gently
into
a
chair
first
a
cigarette
he
said
next
a
little
whisky
and
then
i
shall
be
delighted
to
listen
no
please
do
as
i
say
laurie
permitted
himself
to
be
managed
there
was
a
strong
almost
paternal
air
in
the
other
manner
that
was
difficult
to
resist
he
lit
his
cigarette
he
sipped
his
whisky
but
his
movements
were
nervously
quick
well
then
and
he
interrupted
himself
what
are
those
things
mr
vincent
he
nodded
towards
the
second
shelf
in
the
bookcase
vincent
turned
on
the
hearthrug
those
oh
those
are
a
few
rather
elementary
instruments
for
my
work
he
lifted
down
a
crystal
ball
on
a
small
black
polished
wooden
stand
and
handed
it
over
you
have
heard
of
well
that
is
the
article
is
that
crystal
oh
no
common
glass
price
three
shillings
and
sixpence
laurie
turned
it
over
letting
the
shining
globe
run
on
to
his
hand
and
this
is
he
began
and
this
said
the
medium
setting
a
curious
affair
its
sails
lined
with
on
the
little
table
by
the
fire
this
is
a
french
toy
very
elementary
what
that
look
vincent
wound
a
small
handle
at
the
back
of
the
windmill
to
a
sound
of
clockwork
set
it
down
again
and
released
it
instantly
the
sails
began
to
revolve
noiseless
and
swift
producing
the
effect
of
a
rapidly
flashing
circle
of
light
across
which
span
lines
waxing
and
waning
with
extraordinary
speed
what
the
it
a
little
machine
for
inducing
sleep
oh
i
have
used
that
for
months
but
it
useful
sometimes
the
hypnotic
subject
just
stares
at
that
steadily
why
you
looking
dazed
yourself
already
baxter
smiled
the
medium
he
stopped
the
mechanism
and
pushed
it
on
one
side
and
what
the
other
asked
laurie
looking
again
at
the
shelf
ah
the
medium
with
quite
a
different
air
took
down
and
set
before
him
an
object
resembling
a
tiny
table
on
three
wheeled
legs
perhaps
four
or
five
inches
across
through
the
center
ran
a
pencil
perpendicularly
of
which
the
point
just
touched
the
tablecloth
on
which
the
thing
rested
laurie
looked
at
it
and
glanced
up
yes
that
planchette
said
the
medium
for
for
automatic
writing
the
other
nodded
yes
he
said
the
experimenter
puts
his
fingers
lightly
upon
that
and
there
a
sheet
of
paper
beneath
that
is
all
laurie
looked
at
him
half
curiously
then
with
a
sudden
movement
he
stood
up
yes
he
said
thank
you
but
please
sit
down
baxter
i
know
you
have
come
about
that
kind
of
thing
will
you
kindly
tell
me
what
you
have
come
about
he
too
sat
down
and
without
looking
at
the
other
began
slowly
to
fill
his
pipe
again
with
his
strong
capable
fingers
laurie
stared
at
the
process
unseeing
just
tell
me
simply
said
the
medium
again
still
without
looking
at
him
laurie
threw
himself
back
well
i
will
he
said
i
know
it
absurdly
childish
but
i
a
little
frightened
it
about
a
dream
that
not
necessarily
childish
it
a
dream
i
had
tonight
in
my
chair
after
dinner
well
then
laurie
began
for
about
ten
minutes
he
talked
without
ceasing
vincent
smoked
tranquilly
putting
what
seemed
to
laurie
quite
unimportant
questions
now
and
again
and
nodding
gently
from
time
to
time
and
i
frightened
ended
laurie
and
i
want
you
to
tell
me
what
it
all
means
the
other
drew
a
long
inhalation
through
his
pipe
expelled
it
and
leaned
back
oh
it
comparatively
common
he
said
common
that
is
with
people
of
your
temperament
baxter
and
mine
you
tell
me
that
it
was
prayer
that
enabled
you
to
get
through
at
the
end
that
is
interesting
but
but
was
it
more
than
fancy
more
i
mean
than
an
ordinary
dream
oh
yes
it
was
objective
it
was
a
real
experience
you
mean
baxter
just
listen
to
me
for
a
minute
or
two
you
can
ask
any
questions
you
like
at
the
end
first
you
are
a
catholic
you
told
me
you
believe
that
is
to
say
among
other
things
that
the
spiritual
world
is
a
real
thing
always
present
more
or
less
well
of
course
i
agree
with
you
though
i
do
not
agree
with
you
altogether
as
to
the
geography
and
and
other
details
of
that
world
but
you
believe
i
take
it
that
this
world
is
continually
with
us
that
this
room
so
to
speak
is
a
great
deal
more
than
that
of
which
our
senses
tell
us
that
there
are
with
us
now
and
always
a
multitude
of
influences
good
bad
and
indifferent
really
present
to
our
spirits
i
suppose
so
said
laurie
now
begin
again
there
are
two
kinds
of
dreams
i
am
just
stating
my
own
belief
baxter
you
can
make
what
comments
you
like
afterwards
the
one
kind
of
dream
is
entirely
unimportant
it
is
merely
a
hash
a
of
our
own
thoughts
in
which
little
things
that
we
have
experienced
reappear
in
a
hopeless
sort
of
confusion
it
is
the
kind
of
dream
that
we
forget
altogether
generally
five
minutes
after
waking
if
not
before
but
there
is
another
kind
of
dream
that
we
do
not
forget
it
leaves
as
vivid
an
impression
upon
us
as
if
it
were
a
waking
experience
an
actual
incident
and
that
is
exactly
what
it
is
i
do
understand
have
you
ever
heard
of
the
subliminal
consciousness
mr
baxter
no
the
medium
smiled
that
is
fortunate
he
said
it
being
run
to
death
just
now
well
i
put
it
in
an
untechnical
way
there
is
a
part
of
us
is
there
not
that
lies
below
our
ordinary
waking
thoughts
that
part
of
us
in
which
our
dreams
reside
our
habits
take
shape
our
instincts
intuitions
and
all
the
rest
are
generated
well
in
ordinary
dreams
when
we
are
asleep
it
is
this
part
that
is
active
the
pot
boils
so
to
speak
all
by
itself
uncontrolled
by
reason
a
madman
is
a
man
in
whom
this
part
is
supreme
in
his
waking
life
as
well
well
it
is
through
this
part
of
us
that
we
communicate
with
the
spiritual
world
there
are
let
us
say
two
doors
in
it
that
which
leads
up
to
our
senses
through
which
come
down
our
waking
experiences
to
be
stored
up
and
and
the
other
door
yes
the
medium
hesitated
well
he
said
in
some
natures
yours
for
instance
baxter
this
door
opens
rather
easily
it
was
through
that
door
that
you
went
i
think
in
what
you
call
your
you
yourself
said
it
was
quite
unlike
ordinary
dreams
yes
and
i
am
the
more
sure
that
this
is
so
since
your
experience
is
exactly
that
of
so
many
others
under
the
same
circumstances
laurie
moved
uncomfortably
in
his
chair
i
do
quite
understand
he
said
sharply
you
mean
it
was
not
a
dream
certainly
not
at
least
not
a
dream
in
the
ordinary
sense
it
was
an
actual
experience
but
but
i
was
asleep
certainly
that
is
one
of
the
usual
conditions
an
almost
indispensable
condition
in
fact
the
objective
self
i
mean
the
ordinary
workaday
faculties
was
lulled
and
your
subjective
self
call
it
what
you
like
but
it
is
your
real
self
the
essential
self
that
survives
death
this
self
simply
went
through
the
inner
door
and
and
saw
what
was
to
be
seen
laurie
looked
at
him
intently
but
there
was
a
touch
of
apprehension
in
his
face
too
you
mean
he
said
slowly
that
that
all
i
saw
the
limitations
of
space
and
so
forth
that
these
were
facts
and
not
fancies
certainly
does
your
theology
hint
at
something
of
the
kind
laurie
was
silent
he
had
no
idea
of
what
his
theology
told
him
on
the
point
but
why
should
i
i
of
all
people
have
such
an
experience
he
asked
suddenly
the
medium
smiled
who
can
tell
that
he
said
why
should
one
man
be
an
artist
and
another
not
it
is
a
matter
of
temperament
you
see
you
begun
to
develop
that
temperament
at
last
and
it
a
very
marked
one
to
begin
with
as
for
laurie
interrupted
him
yes
yes
he
said
but
there
another
point
what
about
that
fear
i
had
when
i
tried
to
to
awaken
there
passed
over
the
medium
face
a
shade
of
gravity
it
was
no
more
than
a
shade
but
it
was
there
he
reached
out
rather
quickly
for
his
pipe
which
he
had
laid
aside
and
blew
through
it
carefully
before
answering
that
he
said
with
what
seemed
to
the
boy
an
affected
carelessness
that
oh
that
a
common
experience
do
think
about
that
too
much
baxter
it
never
very
healthy
i
am
sorry
said
laurie
deliberately
but
i
must
ask
you
to
tell
me
what
you
think
i
must
know
what
i
doing
the
medium
filled
his
pipe
again
twice
he
began
to
speak
and
checked
himself
and
in
the
long
silence
laurie
felt
his
fears
gather
upon
him
tenfold
please
tell
me
at
once
vincent
he
said
unless
i
know
everything
that
is
to
be
known
i
will
not
go
another
step
along
this
road
i
really
mean
that
the
medium
paused
in
his
and
what
if
i
do
tell
you
he
said
in
his
slow
virile
voice
are
you
sure
you
will
not
be
turned
back
if
it
is
a
danger
and
can
be
avoided
with
prudence
i
certainly
shall
not
turn
back
very
well
baxter
i
will
take
you
at
your
word
have
you
ever
heard
the
phrase
watcher
on
the
threshold
laurie
shook
his
head
no
he
said
at
least
i
do
think
so
well
said
the
medium
quietly
that
is
what
we
call
the
fear
you
spoke
of
no
do
interrupt
i
tell
you
all
we
know
it
not
very
much
he
paused
again
stretched
his
hand
for
the
matches
and
took
one
out
laurie
watched
him
as
if
fascinated
by
the
action
outside
roared
oxford
street
in
one
long
rolling
sound
as
of
the
sea
but
within
here
was
that
quiet
retired
silence
which
the
boy
had
noticed
before
in
the
same
company
was
that
fancy
too
he
wondered
the
medium
lit
his
pipe
and
leaned
back
i
tell
you
all
we
know
he
said
again
quietly
it
not
very
much
really
the
phrase
i
used
just
now
sums
it
up
pretty
well
we
who
have
tried
to
get
beyond
this
world
of
sense
have
become
aware
of
certain
facts
of
which
the
world
generally
knows
nothing
at
all
one
of
these
facts
is
that
the
door
between
this
life
and
the
other
is
guarded
by
a
certain
being
of
whom
we
know
really
nothing
at
all
except
that
his
presence
causes
the
most
appalling
fear
in
those
who
experience
it
he
is
set
there
god
only
knows
why
and
his
main
business
seems
to
be
to
restrain
if
possible
from
the
body
those
who
have
left
it
just
occasionally
his
presence
is
perceived
by
those
on
this
side
but
not
often
but
i
have
been
present
at
where
he
has
been
seen
seen
oh
yes
seen
by
the
dying
person
it
is
usually
only
a
glimpse
it
might
be
said
to
be
a
mistake
for
myself
i
believe
that
that
appalling
terror
that
now
and
then
shows
itself
even
in
people
who
do
not
fear
death
itself
who
are
perfectly
resigned
who
have
nothing
on
their
conscience
well
personally
i
believe
the
fear
comes
from
a
sight
of
this
this
personage
laurie
licked
his
dry
lips
he
told
himself
that
he
did
not
believe
one
word
of
it
and
and
he
is
evil
he
asked
the
other
shrugged
his
shoulders
is
that
a
relative
term
he
said
from
one
point
of
view
certainly
but
not
necessarily
from
all
and
and
what
the
good
of
it
the
medium
smiled
a
little
that
a
question
we
soon
cease
to
ask
you
must
remember
that
we
hardly
know
anything
at
all
yet
but
one
thing
seems
more
and
more
certain
the
more
we
investigate
and
that
is
that
our
point
of
view
is
not
the
only
one
nor
even
the
principal
one
christianity
i
fancy
says
the
same
thing
does
it
not
the
of
god
whatever
that
may
be
comes
before
even
the
of
souls
laurie
wrenched
his
attention
once
more
to
a
focus
then
i
was
in
danger
he
said
certainly
we
are
always
in
danger
you
mean
if
i
had
prayed
ah
that
is
another
question
but
in
short
if
you
succeeded
in
getting
past
well
you
have
failed
again
there
fell
a
silence
it
seemed
to
laurie
as
if
his
world
were
falling
about
him
yet
he
was
far
from
sure
whether
it
were
not
all
an
illusion
but
the
extreme
quietness
and
confidence
of
this
man
in
enunciating
these
startling
theories
had
their
effect
it
was
practically
impossible
for
the
boy
to
sit
here
still
nervous
from
his
experience
and
hear
unmoved
this
apparently
reasonable
and
connected
account
of
things
that
were
certainly
incomprehensible
on
any
other
hypothesis
his
remembrance
of
the
very
startling
uniqueness
of
his
dream
was
still
vivid
surely
it
all
fitted
in
yet
but
there
is
one
thing
broke
in
the
medium
quiet
voice
should
you
ever
experience
this
kind
of
thing
again
i
should
recommend
you
not
to
pray
just
exercise
your
own
individuality
assert
yourself
do
lean
on
another
you
are
quite
strong
enough
you
mean
i
mean
exactly
what
i
say
what
is
called
prayer
is
really
an
imaginative
concession
to
weakness
take
the
short
cut
rather
assert
your
own
your
own
individuality
laurie
changed
his
attitude
he
uncrossed
his
feet
and
sat
up
a
little
oh
pray
if
you
want
to
said
the
medium
but
you
must
remember
baxter
that
you
are
quite
an
exceptional
person
i
assure
you
that
you
have
no
conception
of
your
own
powers
i
must
say
that
i
hope
you
will
take
the
strong
line
he
paused
these
for
instance
now
that
you
know
a
little
more
of
the
dangers
are
you
going
to
turn
back
his
overhung
kindly
eyes
looked
out
keenly
for
an
instant
at
the
restless
face
i
do
know
said
laurie
i
must
think
he
got
up
look
here
vincent
he
said
it
seems
to
me
extraordinarily
er
extraordinarily
plausible
but
i
even
now
not
quite
sure
whether
i
not
going
mad
it
like
a
perfectly
mad
dream
all
these
things
one
on
the
top
of
the
other
he
paused
looking
sharply
at
the
elder
man
and
away
again
yes
laurie
began
to
finger
a
pencil
that
lay
on
the
you
see
what
i
mean
do
you
he
said
i
not
disputing
er
your
point
of
view
nor
your
sincerity
but
i
do
wish
you
would
give
me
another
proof
or
two
you
have
had
enough
oh
i
suppose
i
have
if
i
were
reasonable
but
you
know
it
all
seems
to
me
as
if
you
suddenly
demonstrated
to
me
that
twice
two
made
five
but
then
surely
no
proof
yes
i
know
i
quite
see
that
yet
i
want
one
something
quite
absolutely
ordinary
if
you
can
do
all
these
things
spirits
and
all
the
rest
ca
you
do
something
ever
so
much
simpler
that
beyond
mistake
oh
i
daresay
but
would
you
ask
yet
another
after
that
i
do
know
or
would
you
think
you
been
hypnotized
laurie
shook
his
head
i
not
a
fool
he
said
then
give
me
that
pencil
said
the
medium
suddenly
extending
his
hand
laurie
stared
a
moment
then
he
handed
over
the
pencil
on
the
little
table
by
the
a
couple
of
feet
from
laurie
stood
the
whisky
apparatus
and
a
box
of
cigarettes
these
the
medium
without
moving
from
his
chair
lifted
off
and
set
on
the
floor
beside
him
leaving
the
surface
of
the
table
entirely
bare
he
then
laid
the
pencil
gently
in
the
center
all
without
a
word
laurie
watched
him
carefully
now
kindly
do
not
speak
one
word
or
make
one
movement
said
the
man
peremptorily
wait
you
perfectly
sure
you
not
hypnotized
or
any
other
nonsense
certainly
not
just
go
round
the
room
look
out
of
the
window
poke
the
fire
anything
you
like
i
satisfied
said
the
boy
very
good
then
kindly
watch
that
pencil
the
medium
leaned
a
little
forward
in
his
chair
bending
his
eyes
steadily
upon
the
little
wooden
cylinder
lying
like
any
other
pencil
on
the
top
of
the
table
laurie
glanced
once
at
him
then
back
again
there
it
lay
common
and
ordinary
for
at
least
a
minute
nothing
happened
at
all
except
that
from
the
intentness
of
the
elder
man
there
seemed
once
more
to
radiate
out
that
curious
air
of
silence
that
laurie
was
beginning
to
know
so
well
that
silence
that
seemed
impenetrable
to
the
common
sounds
of
the
world
and
to
exist
altogether
independent
of
them
once
and
again
he
glanced
round
at
the
room
the
curtained
windows
the
dull
furniture
and
the
second
time
he
looked
back
at
the
pencil
he
was
almost
certain
that
some
movement
had
just
taken
place
with
it
he
resolutely
fixed
his
eyes
upon
it
bending
every
faculty
he
possessed
into
one
tense
attitude
of
attention
and
a
moment
later
he
could
not
resist
a
sudden
movement
and
a
swift
indrawing
of
breath
for
there
before
his
very
eyes
the
pencil
tilted
very
hesitatingly
and
quiveringly
as
if
pulled
by
a
spider
thread
he
heard
too
the
tiny
tap
of
its
fall
he
glanced
at
the
medium
who
jerked
his
head
impatiently
as
if
for
silence
then
once
more
the
silence
came
down
a
minute
later
there
was
no
longer
the
possibility
of
a
doubt
there
before
the
boy
eyes
as
he
stared
with
parted
lips
the
pencil
rose
hesitated
quivered
but
instead
of
falling
back
again
hung
so
for
a
moment
on
its
point
forming
with
itself
an
acute
angle
with
the
plane
of
the
table
in
an
entirely
impossible
position
then
once
more
rising
higher
swung
on
its
point
in
a
quarter
circle
and
after
one
more
pause
and
quiver
rose
to
its
full
height
remained
poised
one
instant
then
fell
with
a
sudden
movement
rolled
across
the
table
and
dropped
on
the
carpet
the
medium
leaned
back
drawing
a
long
breath
there
he
said
and
smiled
at
the
bewildered
young
man
but
but
began
the
other
yes
i
know
said
the
man
it
startling
is
it
and
indeed
it
not
as
easy
as
it
looks
i
was
at
all
sure
but
good
lord
i
saw
of
course
you
did
but
how
do
you
know
you
were
hypnotized
laurie
sat
down
suddenly
unconscious
that
he
had
done
so
the
medium
put
out
his
hand
for
his
pipe
once
more
now
i
going
to
be
quite
honest
he
said
i
have
quite
a
quantity
of
comments
to
make
on
that
first
it
does
prove
anything
whatever
even
if
it
really
happened
even
if
it
certainly
oh
yes
i
saw
it
too
and
there
the
pencil
on
the
floor
he
stooped
and
picked
it
up
but
what
if
we
were
both
hypnotized
both
acted
upon
by
we
ca
prove
we
were
laurie
was
dumb
secondly
it
does
prove
anything
in
any
case
as
regards
the
other
matters
we
were
speaking
of
it
only
shows
if
it
really
happened
as
i
say
that
the
mind
has
extraordinary
control
over
matter
it
has
anything
to
do
with
immortality
or
or
spiritualism
then
why
did
you
do
it
gasped
the
boy
merely
fireworks
only
to
show
off
people
are
convinced
by
such
queer
things
laurie
sat
regarding
still
with
an
unusual
pallor
in
his
face
and
brightness
in
his
eyes
he
could
not
in
the
last
degree
put
into
words
why
it
was
that
the
tiny
incident
of
the
pencil
affected
him
so
profoundly
vaguely
only
he
perceived
that
it
was
all
connected
somehow
with
the
ordinariness
of
the
accessories
and
more
impressive
therefore
than
all
the
paraphernalia
of
planchette
spinning
mirrors
or
even
his
own
dreams
he
stood
up
again
suddenly
it
no
good
vincent
he
said
putting
out
his
hand
knocked
over
i
ca
imagine
why
it
no
use
talking
now
i
must
think
good
night
good
night
baxter
said
the
medium
serenely
i
her
ladyship
told
me
to
show
you
in
here
sir
said
the
footman
at
eight
on
sunday
evening
laurie
put
down
his
hat
slipped
off
his
coat
and
went
into
the
dining
room
the
table
was
still
littered
with
and
napkins
two
people
had
dined
there
he
observed
he
went
round
to
the
fire
wondering
vaguely
as
to
why
he
had
not
been
shown
upstairs
and
stood
warming
his
hands
behind
him
and
looking
at
the
pleasant
gloom
of
the
high
walls
in
spite
of
himself
he
felt
slightly
more
excited
than
he
had
thought
he
would
be
it
was
one
thing
to
be
philosophical
at
a
prospect
of
three
days
distance
and
another
when
the
gates
of
death
actually
rise
in
sight
he
wondered
in
what
mood
he
would
see
his
own
rooms
again
then
he
yawned
slightly
and
was
a
little
pleased
that
it
was
natural
to
yawn
there
was
a
rustle
outside
the
door
opened
and
lady
laura
slipped
in
forgive
me
baxter
she
said
i
wanted
to
have
just
a
word
with
you
first
please
sit
down
a
moment
she
seemed
a
little
anxious
and
upset
thought
laurie
as
he
sat
down
and
looked
at
her
in
her
evening
dress
with
the
emblematic
chain
more
apparent
than
ever
her
frizzed
hair
sat
as
usual
on
the
top
of
her
head
and
her
glimmered
at
him
across
the
hearthrug
like
the
eyes
of
a
cat
it
is
this
she
said
hurriedly
i
felt
i
must
just
speak
to
you
i
was
sure
whether
you
quite
realized
the
the
dangers
of
all
this
i
did
want
you
to
to
run
any
risks
in
my
house
i
should
feel
responsible
you
know
she
laughed
nervously
risks
would
you
mind
explaining
said
laurie
there
there
are
always
risks
you
know
what
sort
oh
you
know
nerves
and
so
on
i
i
have
seen
people
very
much
upset
at
more
than
once
laurie
smiled
i
do
think
you
need
be
afraid
lady
laura
it
awfully
kind
of
you
but
do
you
know
i
ashamed
to
say
that
if
anything
rather
bored
the
gleamed
but
but
do
you
believe
it
i
thought
vincent
said
oh
yes
i
believe
it
but
you
know
it
seems
to
me
so
natural
now
even
if
nothing
happens
tonight
i
do
think
i
shall
believe
it
any
the
less
she
was
silent
an
instant
you
know
there
are
other
risks
she
said
suddenly
what
are
things
thrown
about
please
do
laugh
at
it
baxter
i
am
quite
serious
well
what
kind
do
you
mean
again
she
paused
it
very
awful
she
said
but
you
know
people
nerves
do
break
down
entirely
sometimes
even
though
they
not
in
the
least
afraid
i
saw
a
case
once
she
stopped
yes
it
it
was
a
very
awful
case
a
girl
a
sensitive
broke
down
altogether
under
the
strain
she
in
an
asylum
i
do
think
that
likely
for
me
said
laurie
with
a
touch
of
humor
in
his
voice
and
after
all
you
run
these
risks
you
and
mrs
stapleton
yes
but
you
see
we
not
sensitives
and
even
i
yes
well
even
i
feel
sometimes
rather
overcome
baxter
do
you
quite
realize
what
it
all
means
i
think
so
to
tell
the
truth
he
stopped
yes
but
the
thing
itself
is
really
overwhelming
there
an
extraordinary
power
sometimes
you
know
i
was
with
maud
stapleton
when
she
saw
her
father
she
stopped
again
yes
i
saw
him
too
you
know
oh
there
was
no
possibility
of
fraud
it
was
with
vincent
it
it
was
rather
terrible
yes
maud
fainted
please
do
tell
her
i
told
you
baxter
she
would
like
you
to
know
that
and
then
other
things
happen
sometimes
which
are
nice
do
you
think
me
a
great
coward
i
i
think
i
got
a
fit
of
nerves
tonight
laurie
could
see
that
she
was
trembling
i
think
you
very
kind
he
said
to
take
the
trouble
to
tell
me
all
this
but
indeed
i
was
quite
ready
to
be
startled
i
quite
understand
what
you
mean
but
baxter
you
ca
understand
unless
you
experienced
it
and
you
know
the
other
day
here
you
knew
nothing
at
all
you
were
not
conscious
now
tonight
you
to
keep
awake
vincent
going
to
arrange
to
do
what
he
can
about
that
and
and
i
do
quite
like
it
why
what
on
earth
can
happen
asked
laurie
bewildered
baxter
i
suppose
you
realize
that
it
you
that
they
whoever
they
are
are
interested
in
there
no
kind
of
doubt
that
you
be
the
center
tonight
and
i
did
just
want
you
to
understand
fully
that
there
are
risks
i
should
like
to
think
laurie
stood
up
i
understand
perfectly
he
said
certainly
i
always
knew
there
were
risks
i
hold
myself
responsible
and
no
one
else
is
that
quite
clear
the
wire
of
the
bell
suddenly
twitched
in
the
hall
and
a
peal
came
up
the
stairs
he
come
said
the
other
come
upstairs
baxter
please
say
a
word
of
what
i
said
she
hurried
out
and
he
after
her
as
the
footman
came
up
from
the
lower
regions
the
presented
an
unusual
appearance
to
laurie
as
he
came
in
all
the
small
furniture
had
been
moved
away
to
the
side
where
the
windows
looked
into
the
street
and
formed
there
what
looked
like
an
amateur
barricade
in
the
center
of
the
room
immediately
below
the
electric
light
stood
a
solid
small
round
table
with
four
chairs
set
round
it
as
if
for
bridge
there
was
on
the
side
further
from
the
street
a
kind
of
communicating
with
the
main
room
by
a
high
wide
archway
nearly
as
large
as
the
room
to
which
it
gave
access
and
within
this
full
in
sight
stood
a
curious
erection
not
unlike
a
confessional
seated
within
for
one
roofed
walled
and
floored
with
thin
wood
the
front
of
this
was
open
but
screened
partly
by
two
curtains
that
seemed
to
hang
from
a
rod
within
the
rest
of
the
little
extra
room
was
entirely
empty
except
for
the
piano
that
stood
closed
in
the
corner
there
were
two
persons
standing
rather
disconsolately
on
the
vacant
hearthrug
stapleton
and
the
clergyman
whom
laurie
had
met
on
his
last
visit
here
jamieson
wore
an
expression
usually
associated
with
funerals
and
stapleton
face
was
full
of
suppressed
excitement
dearest
what
a
time
you
been
was
that
mr
vincent
i
think
so
said
lady
laura
the
two
men
nodded
to
one
another
and
an
instant
later
the
medium
came
in
he
was
in
evening
clothes
and
more
than
ever
laurie
thought
how
average
and
conventional
he
looked
his
manner
was
not
in
the
least
pontifical
and
he
shook
hands
cordially
and
naturally
but
gave
one
quick
glance
of
approval
at
laurie
it
struck
me
as
extraordinarily
cold
he
said
i
see
you
have
an
excellent
fire
and
he
stooped
rubbing
his
hands
together
to
warm
them
we
must
screen
that
presently
he
said
then
he
stood
up
again
there
no
use
in
wasting
time
may
i
say
a
word
first
lady
laura
she
nodded
looking
at
him
almost
apprehensively
first
i
must
ask
you
gentlemen
to
give
me
your
word
on
a
certain
point
i
have
not
an
idea
how
things
will
go
or
whether
we
shall
get
any
results
but
we
are
going
to
attempt
materialization
probably
in
any
case
this
will
not
go
very
far
we
may
not
be
able
to
do
more
than
to
see
some
figure
or
face
but
in
any
case
i
want
you
two
gentlemen
to
give
me
your
word
that
you
will
attempt
no
violence
anything
in
the
nature
of
seizing
the
figure
may
have
very
disastrous
results
indeed
to
myself
you
understand
that
what
you
will
see
if
you
see
anything
will
not
be
actual
flesh
or
blood
it
will
be
formed
of
a
certain
matter
of
which
we
understand
very
little
at
present
but
which
is
at
any
rate
intimately
connected
with
myself
or
with
someone
present
really
we
know
no
more
of
it
than
that
we
are
all
of
us
inquirers
equally
now
will
you
gentlemen
give
me
your
words
of
honor
that
you
will
obey
me
in
this
and
that
in
all
other
matters
you
will
follow
the
directions
of
he
glanced
at
the
two
ladies
of
stapleton
and
do
nothing
without
her
consent
he
spoke
in
a
brisk
way
and
looked
keenly
from
face
to
face
of
the
two
men
as
he
ended
i
give
you
my
word
said
laurie
yes
just
so
said
jamieson
now
there
is
one
matter
more
went
on
the
medium
baxter
you
are
aware
that
you
are
a
sensitive
of
a
very
high
order
now
i
do
not
wish
you
to
pass
into
trance
tonight
kindly
keep
your
attention
fixed
upon
me
steadily
watch
me
closely
you
will
be
able
to
see
me
quite
well
enough
as
i
shall
explain
presently
stapleton
will
sit
with
her
back
to
the
fire
lady
laura
opposite
jamieson
with
his
back
to
the
cabinet
and
you
baxter
facing
it
yes
jamieson
you
may
turn
round
freely
so
long
as
you
keep
your
hands
upon
the
table
now
if
you
feel
anything
resembling
sleep
or
unconsciousness
coming
upon
you
irresistibly
baxter
i
wish
you
just
lightly
to
tap
stapleton
hand
she
will
then
if
necessary
break
up
the
circle
give
the
signal
directly
you
feel
the
sensation
is
really
coming
on
or
if
you
find
it
very
difficult
to
keep
your
attention
fixed
you
will
do
this
i
will
do
it
said
laurie
then
that
is
really
all
he
moved
a
step
away
from
the
fire
then
he
paused
by
the
way
i
may
as
well
just
tell
you
our
methods
i
shall
take
my
place
within
the
cabinet
drawing
the
curtains
partly
across
at
the
top
so
as
to
shade
my
face
but
you
will
be
able
to
see
the
whole
of
my
body
and
probably
even
my
face
as
well
you
four
will
please
to
sit
at
the
table
in
the
order
i
have
indicated
with
your
hands
resting
upon
it
you
will
not
speak
unless
you
are
spoken
to
or
until
stapleton
gives
the
signal
that
is
all
you
then
wait
now
it
may
be
ten
minutes
half
an
hour
an
hour
anything
up
to
two
hours
before
anything
happens
if
there
is
no
result
stapleton
will
break
up
the
circle
at
eleven
and
awaken
me
if
necessary
he
broke
off
kindly
just
examine
the
cabinet
and
the
whole
room
first
gentlemen
we
mediums
must
protect
ourselves
he
smiled
genially
and
nodded
to
the
two
laurie
went
straight
across
the
open
floor
to
the
cabinet
it
was
raised
on
four
feet
about
twelve
inches
from
the
ground
heavy
green
curtains
hung
from
a
bar
within
laurie
took
these
and
ran
them
to
and
fro
then
he
went
into
the
cabinet
it
was
entirely
empty
except
for
a
single
board
that
formed
the
seat
as
he
came
out
he
encountered
the
awestruck
face
of
the
clergyman
who
had
followed
him
in
dead
silence
and
now
went
into
the
cabinet
after
him
laurie
passed
round
behind
the
little
room
was
empty
except
for
the
piano
at
the
back
and
two
low
bookshelves
on
either
side
of
the
fireless
hearth
the
window
looking
presumably
into
the
garden
was
shuttered
from
top
to
bottom
and
barred
and
the
curtains
were
drawn
back
so
that
it
could
be
seen
a
cat
could
not
have
hidden
in
the
place
it
was
all
perfectly
satisfactory
he
came
back
to
where
the
others
were
standing
silent
and
the
clergyman
followed
him
you
are
satisfied
gentlemen
said
the
medium
smiling
perfectly
said
laurie
and
the
clergyman
bowed
well
then
said
the
other
it
is
close
upon
nine
he
indicated
the
chairs
and
himself
went
past
towards
the
cabinet
his
heavy
step
making
the
room
vibrate
as
he
went
as
he
came
near
the
door
he
fumbled
with
the
button
and
all
the
lights
but
one
went
out
the
four
sat
down
laurie
watched
vincent
step
up
into
the
cabinet
jerk
the
curtains
this
way
and
that
and
at
last
sit
easily
back
in
such
a
way
that
his
face
could
be
seen
in
a
kind
of
twilight
and
the
rest
of
his
body
perfectly
visible
then
silence
came
down
upon
the
room
ii
the
cat
of
the
next
house
decided
to
go
after
an
excellent
supper
of
he
had
an
appointment
with
a
friend
so
he
cleaned
himself
carefully
on
the
landing
outside
the
pantry
evaded
a
couple
of
caresses
from
the
young
footman
lately
come
from
the
country
and
finally
leapt
on
the
and
sat
there
regarding
the
back
garden
the
smoky
wall
beyond
seen
in
the
light
of
the
pantry
window
and
the
high
and
forbidding
against
the
luminous
night
sky
his
tail
moved
with
a
soft
ominous
sinuousness
as
he
looked
presently
he
climbed
cautiously
out
beneath
the
sash
gathered
himself
for
a
spring
and
the
next
instant
was
seated
on
the
boundary
wall
between
his
own
house
and
that
of
lady
laura
here
again
he
paused
that
which
served
him
for
a
mind
that
mysterious
bundle
of
intuitions
and
instincts
by
which
he
reckoned
time
exchanged
confidences
and
arranged
experiences
informed
him
that
the
night
was
yet
young
and
that
his
friend
would
not
yet
be
arrived
he
sat
there
so
still
and
so
long
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
resolute
head
and
the
blunt
spires
of
his
ears
he
would
have
appeared
to
an
onlooker
below
as
no
more
than
a
humpy
finial
on
an
otherwise
regularly
built
wall
now
and
again
the
last
inch
of
his
tail
twitched
slightly
like
an
independent
member
as
he
contemplated
his
thoughts
overhead
the
last
glimmer
of
day
was
utterly
gone
and
in
the
place
of
it
the
mysterious
glow
of
night
over
a
city
hung
high
and
luminous
he
a
cat
descended
from
generations
of
cats
listened
passively
to
the
gentle
roar
of
traffic
that
stood
to
him
for
the
running
of
brooks
and
the
sighing
of
forest
trees
it
was
to
him
the
auditory
background
of
adventure
romance
and
bitter
war
the
energy
of
life
ran
strong
in
his
veins
and
sinews
once
and
again
as
that
which
was
for
him
imaginative
vision
and
anticipation
asserted
itself
he
crisped
his
strong
claws
into
the
crumbling
mortar
shooting
them
by
an
unconscious
muscular
action
from
the
padded
sheaths
in
which
they
lay
once
a
furious
yapping
sounded
from
a
lighted
window
far
beneath
but
he
scorned
to
do
more
than
turn
a
slow
head
in
the
direction
of
it
then
once
more
he
resumed
his
watch
the
time
came
at
last
conveyed
to
him
as
surely
as
by
a
punctual
clock
and
he
rose
noiselessly
to
his
feet
then
again
he
paused
and
stretched
first
one
strong
foreleg
and
then
the
other
to
its
furthest
reach
shooting
again
his
claws
conscious
with
a
faint
sense
of
of
those
muscles
rippling
beneath
his
loose
striped
skin
they
would
be
in
action
presently
and
as
he
did
so
there
looked
over
the
parapet
six
feet
above
him
at
the
top
of
the
trellis
up
which
presently
he
would
ascend
another
resolute
little
head
and
cars
and
a
soft
indescribable
voice
spoke
a
gentle
insult
it
was
his
friend
and
he
knew
well
enough
on
some
high
ridge
in
the
background
squatted
a
young
female
beauty
with
flattened
ears
and
waving
tail
awaiting
the
caresses
of
the
victor
as
he
saw
the
head
above
him
to
human
eyes
a
shapeless
silhouette
to
his
eyes
a
picture
perfect
in
all
its
details
he
paused
in
his
stretching
then
he
sat
back
arranged
his
tail
and
lifted
his
head
to
answer
the
cry
that
came
from
him
not
yet
sounded
in
human
ears
beneath
no
more
than
a
soft
wail
but
to
him
who
sat
above
it
surpassed
in
insolence
even
his
own
carefully
modulated
offensiveness
again
the
other
answered
this
time
lifting
himself
to
his
full
height
sending
a
message
along
the
nerves
of
his
back
that
prickled
his
own
skin
and
passed
out
along
the
tail
with
an
exquisite
ripple
of
movement
and
once
more
came
the
answer
from
below
so
the
preliminary
challenge
went
on
already
in
the
voice
of
each
there
had
begun
to
show
itself
that
faint
note
of
hysteria
that
culminates
presently
in
a
scream
of
anger
and
a
torrent
of
spits
leading
again
in
their
turn
to
an
ominous
silence
and
the
first
fierce
clawing
blows
at
eyes
and
ears
in
another
instant
the
watcher
above
would
recoil
for
a
moment
as
the
swift
rush
was
made
up
the
trellis
and
then
the
battle
would
be
joined
but
that
instant
never
came
there
fell
a
sudden
silence
and
he
peering
down
into
the
grey
gloom
chin
on
paws
and
tail
twitching
eighteen
inches
behind
saw
an
astonishing
sight
his
adversary
had
broken
off
in
the
midst
of
a
long
crescendo
cry
and
was
himself
crouched
flat
upon
the
narrow
wall
staring
now
not
upwards
but
downwards
diagonally
at
a
certain
curtained
window
eight
feet
below
this
was
all
very
unusual
and
contrary
to
precedent
a
dog
a
human
hand
armed
with
a
missile
a
furious
minatory
face
these
things
were
not
present
to
account
for
the
breach
of
etiquette
vaguely
he
perceived
this
conscious
only
of
inexplicability
but
he
himself
also
ceased
and
watched
for
developments
very
slowly
they
came
at
first
that
crouching
body
beneath
was
motionless
now
even
the
tail
had
ceased
to
twitch
and
hung
limply
behind
dripping
over
the
edge
of
the
narrow
wall
into
the
unfathomable
pit
of
the
garden
and
as
the
watcher
stared
he
felt
himself
some
communication
of
the
horror
so
apparent
in
the
attitude
along
his
own
spine
from
neck
to
flank
ran
the
paralyzing
nervous
movement
his
own
tail
ceased
to
move
his
own
ears
drew
back
instinctively
flattening
themselves
at
the
sides
of
the
square
strong
head
there
was
a
movement
near
by
and
he
turned
quick
eyes
to
see
the
lithe
young
love
of
his
heart
stepping
softly
into
her
place
beside
him
when
he
turned
again
his
adversary
had
vanished
yet
he
still
watched
still
there
was
no
sound
from
the
window
at
which
the
other
had
stared
just
now
no
oblong
of
light
shone
out
into
the
darkness
to
explain
that
sudden
withdrawal
from
the
fray
all
was
as
silent
as
it
had
been
just
now
on
all
sides
windows
were
closed
now
and
then
came
a
human
voice
just
a
word
or
two
spoken
and
answered
from
one
of
those
pits
beneath
and
the
steady
rumble
of
traffic
went
on
far
away
across
the
roofs
but
here
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
all
was
at
peace
he
knew
well
enough
the
window
in
question
he
had
leapt
himself
upon
the
sill
once
and
again
and
seen
the
foodless
waste
of
floor
and
carpet
and
furniture
within
yet
as
he
watched
and
waited
his
own
horror
grew
that
for
which
in
men
we
have
as
yet
no
term
was
strong
within
him
as
in
every
beast
that
lives
by
perception
rather
than
reason
and
he
too
by
this
strange
faculty
knew
well
enough
that
something
was
abroad
raying
out
from
that
silent
curtained
unseen
window
something
of
an
utterly
different
order
from
that
of
dog
or
flung
shoe
and
furious
vituperation
something
that
affected
certain
nerves
within
his
body
in
a
new
and
awful
manner
once
or
twice
in
his
life
he
had
been
conscious
of
it
before
once
in
an
empty
room
once
in
a
room
tenanted
by
a
mere
outline
beneath
a
sheet
and
closed
by
a
locked
door
his
heart
too
seemed
melted
within
him
his
tail
too
hung
limply
behind
the
stucco
parapet
and
he
made
no
answering
movement
to
the
tiny
crooning
note
that
sounded
once
in
his
ears
and
still
the
horror
grew
presently
he
withdrew
one
claw
from
the
crumbling
edge
raising
his
head
delicately
and
then
the
other
for
an
instant
longer
he
waited
feeling
his
back
heave
uncontrollably
then
dropping
noiselessly
on
to
the
lead
he
fled
beneath
the
sheltering
parapet
a
noiseless
shadow
in
the
gloom
and
his
mate
fled
with
him
i
laurie
turned
slowly
over
in
bed
drew
a
long
breath
expelled
it
and
releasing
his
arms
from
the
sat
up
he
switched
on
the
light
by
his
bed
glanced
at
his
watch
switched
off
the
light
and
sank
down
again
into
the
sheets
he
need
not
get
up
just
yet
then
he
remembered
when
an
event
of
an
entirely
new
order
comes
into
experience
it
takes
a
little
time
to
be
assimilated
it
is
as
when
a
large
piece
of
furniture
is
brought
into
a
room
all
the
rest
of
the
furniture
takes
upon
itself
a
different
value
a
picture
that
did
very
well
up
to
then
over
the
must
perhaps
be
moved
values
relations
and
balance
all
require
readjustment
now
up
to
last
night
laurie
had
indeed
been
convinced
in
one
sense
of
spiritualistic
phenomena
but
they
had
not
yet
for
him
reached
the
point
of
significance
when
they
affected
everything
else
the
new
sideboard
so
to
speak
had
been
brought
into
the
room
but
it
had
been
put
temporarily
against
the
wall
in
a
vacant
space
to
be
looked
at
the
owner
of
the
room
had
not
yet
realized
the
necessity
of
rearranging
the
whole
but
last
night
something
had
happened
that
changed
all
this
he
was
now
beginning
to
perceive
the
need
of
a
complete
review
of
everything
as
he
lay
there
quiet
indeed
but
startlingly
alert
he
first
reviewed
the
single
fact
about
an
hour
or
so
had
passed
away
before
anything
particular
happened
they
had
sat
there
those
four
in
complete
silence
their
hands
upon
the
table
occasionally
shifting
a
little
hearing
the
sound
of
one
another
breathing
or
the
faint
rustle
of
one
of
the
ladies
dresses
in
sufficient
light
from
the
screened
fire
and
the
single
heavily
shaded
electric
burner
to
recognize
faces
and
even
after
the
first
few
minutes
to
distinguish
small
objects
or
to
read
large
print
for
the
most
part
laurie
had
kept
his
eyes
upon
the
medium
in
the
cabinet
there
the
man
had
leaned
back
plainly
visible
for
the
most
part
with
even
the
paleness
of
his
face
and
the
dark
blot
of
his
beard
clearly
discernible
in
the
twilight
now
and
then
the
boy
eyes
had
wandered
to
the
other
faces
to
the
young
clergyman
opposite
downcast
and
motionless
with
a
sort
of
apprehensive
look
and
a
determination
not
to
give
way
to
the
profiles
of
the
two
women
and
the
gleam
of
the
below
lady
laura
frizzed
hair
so
he
had
sat
the
thoughts
at
first
racing
through
his
brain
then
as
time
went
on
moving
more
and
more
slowly
with
his
own
brain
becoming
ever
more
passive
until
at
last
he
had
been
compelled
to
make
a
little
effort
against
the
drowsiness
that
had
begun
to
envelop
him
he
had
had
to
do
this
altogether
three
or
four
times
and
had
even
begun
to
wonder
whether
he
should
be
able
to
resist
much
longer
when
a
sudden
trembling
of
the
table
had
awakened
him
alert
and
conscious
in
a
moment
and
he
had
sat
with
every
faculty
violently
attentive
to
what
should
follow
that
trembling
was
a
curious
sensation
beneath
his
hands
at
first
it
was
no
more
than
might
be
caused
by
the
passing
of
a
heavy
van
in
the
street
only
there
was
no
van
but
it
had
increased
with
spasms
and
recoils
till
it
resembled
a
continuous
shudder
as
of
a
living
rigid
body
it
began
also
to
tilt
slightly
this
way
and
that
now
all
this
laurie
knew
well
meant
nothing
at
all
or
rather
it
need
not
and
when
the
movement
passed
again
through
all
the
reverse
motions
sinking
at
last
into
complete
stillness
he
was
conscious
of
disappointment
a
moment
later
however
as
he
glanced
up
again
at
the
medium
in
the
cabinet
he
drew
his
breath
sharply
and
jamieson
at
the
sound
wheeled
his
head
swiftly
to
look
there
in
the
cabinet
somewhere
overhead
behind
the
curtain
a
faint
but
perfectly
distinct
radiance
was
visible
it
was
no
more
than
a
diffused
glimmer
but
it
was
unmistakable
and
it
shone
out
faintly
and
clearly
upon
the
medium
face
by
its
light
laurie
could
make
out
every
line
and
every
feature
the
drooping
clipped
moustache
the
strong
jutting
nose
the
lines
from
nostril
to
mouth
and
the
closed
eyes
as
he
watched
the
light
deepened
in
intensity
seeming
to
concentrate
itself
in
the
hidden
corner
at
the
top
then
with
a
smooth
steady
motion
it
emerged
into
full
sight
in
appearance
like
a
softly
luminous
globe
of
a
pale
bluish
color
undefined
at
the
edges
floating
steadily
forward
with
a
motion
like
that
of
an
air
balloon
out
into
the
room
once
outside
the
cabinet
it
seemed
to
hesitate
hanging
at
about
the
height
of
a
man
head
then
after
an
instant
it
retired
once
more
the
cabinet
disappeared
in
the
direction
from
which
it
had
come
and
once
more
died
out
well
there
it
had
been
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
and
laurie
was
unacquainted
with
any
mechanism
that
could
produce
it
the
clergyman
too
had
seemed
affected
he
had
watched
with
head
the
phenomenon
from
beginning
to
end
and
at
the
close
with
a
long
indrawing
of
breath
had
looked
once
at
laurie
licked
his
dry
lips
with
a
motion
that
was
audible
in
that
profound
silence
and
once
more
dropped
his
eyes
the
ladies
had
been
silent
and
all
but
motionless
throughout
well
the
rest
had
happened
comparatively
quickly
once
more
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
minutes
the
radiance
had
begun
to
reform
but
this
time
it
had
emerged
almost
immediately
diffused
and
misty
like
a
nebula
had
hung
again
before
the
cabinet
and
then
with
a
strange
gently
whirling
motion
had
seemed
to
arrange
itself
in
lines
and
curves
gradually
as
he
stared
at
it
it
had
begun
to
take
the
shape
and
semblance
of
a
head
swathed
in
drapery
with
that
same
drapery
hanging
as
it
appeared
in
folds
dripping
downwards
to
the
ground
where
it
lost
itself
in
vagueness
then
as
he
still
stared
conscious
of
nothing
but
the
amazing
fact
features
appeared
to
be
forming
first
blots
and
lines
as
of
shadow
finally
eyes
nose
mouth
and
chin
as
of
a
young
girl
a
moment
later
there
was
no
longer
a
doubt
it
was
the
face
of
amy
nugent
that
was
looking
at
him
grave
and
steady
as
when
he
had
seen
it
in
the
moonlight
above
the
sluice
and
behind
seen
half
through
the
strange
drapery
and
half
apart
from
it
a
couple
of
feet
behind
the
face
of
the
sleeping
medium
at
that
sight
he
had
not
moved
nor
spoken
it
was
enough
that
the
fact
was
there
every
power
he
possessed
was
concentrated
in
the
one
effort
of
observation
he
heard
from
somewhere
a
gasping
sigh
and
there
rose
up
between
him
and
the
face
the
figure
of
the
clergyman
with
his
head
turned
back
staring
at
the
apparition
and
one
hand
only
on
the
table
yet
with
that
hand
so
heavy
upon
it
that
the
whole
table
shuddered
with
his
shudder
there
was
a
movement
on
the
left
and
he
heard
a
fierce
feminine
whisper
sit
down
sir
sit
down
this
instant
when
the
clergyman
had
again
sunk
down
into
his
seat
with
that
same
strong
shudder
the
luminous
face
was
already
incoherent
the
features
had
relapsed
again
into
blots
and
shadows
the
drapery
was
absorbing
itself
upwards
into
the
center
from
which
it
came
once
more
the
nebula
trembled
moved
backwards
and
disappeared
the
next
instant
the
radiance
went
out
as
if
turned
off
by
a
switch
the
medium
groaned
gently
and
awoke
well
that
had
ended
it
laurie
scarcely
remembered
the
talking
that
followed
the
explanations
the
apologies
the
hardly
concealed
terror
of
the
young
clergyman
the
medium
had
come
out
presently
dazed
and
confused
they
had
talked
and
so
forth
then
laurie
had
come
home
still
trying
to
assimilate
the
amazing
fact
of
which
he
said
that
it
could
make
no
difference
that
he
had
seen
with
his
own
eyes
the
face
of
amy
nugent
four
months
after
her
death
now
here
he
was
in
bed
on
the
following
morning
trying
to
assimilate
it
once
more
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
sleep
had
done
its
work
that
the
subconscious
intelligence
had
been
able
to
take
the
fact
in
and
that
henceforth
it
was
an
established
thing
in
his
experience
he
was
not
excited
now
but
he
was
intensely
and
overwhelmingly
interested
there
the
thing
was
now
what
difference
did
it
make
first
he
understood
that
it
made
an
enormous
difference
to
the
value
of
the
most
ordinary
things
it
really
was
true
as
true
as
tables
and
chairs
that
there
was
a
life
after
this
and
that
personality
survived
never
again
could
he
doubt
that
for
one
instant
even
in
the
gloomiest
mood
so
long
as
a
man
walks
by
faith
by
the
acceptance
of
authority
human
or
divine
there
is
always
psychologically
possible
the
assertion
of
self
the
instinct
that
what
one
has
not
personally
experienced
may
just
conceivably
be
untrue
but
when
one
has
seen
so
long
as
memory
does
not
disappear
this
agnostic
instinct
is
an
impossibility
every
single
act
therefore
has
a
new
significance
there
is
no
venture
about
it
any
more
there
is
indeed
very
little
opportunity
for
heroism
once
it
is
certain
by
the
evidence
of
the
senses
that
death
is
just
an
interlude
this
life
becomes
merely
part
of
a
long
process
now
as
to
the
conduct
of
that
life
what
of
religion
and
here
for
a
moment
or
two
laurie
was
genuinely
dismayed
for
as
he
looked
at
the
catholic
religion
he
perceived
that
the
whole
thing
had
changed
it
no
longer
seemed
august
and
dominant
as
he
contemplated
himself
as
he
had
been
at
mass
on
the
previous
morning
he
seemed
to
have
been
rather
absurd
why
all
this
trouble
all
this
energy
all
these
innumerable
acts
and
efforts
of
faith
it
was
not
that
his
religion
seemed
necessarily
untrue
it
was
certainly
possible
for
a
man
to
hold
simultaneously
catholic
and
spiritualistic
beliefs
there
had
not
been
a
hint
last
night
against
christianity
and
yet
in
the
face
of
this
evidence
of
the
senses
catholicism
seemed
a
very
shadowy
thing
it
might
well
be
true
as
any
philosophy
may
be
true
but
did
it
matter
very
much
to
be
enthusiastic
about
it
was
the
frenzy
of
an
artist
who
loves
the
portrait
more
than
the
original
and
possibly
a
very
misleading
and
inadequate
portrait
laurie
had
seen
for
himself
the
original
last
night
he
had
seen
a
disembodied
soul
in
a
garb
assumed
for
the
purpose
of
identification
did
he
need
then
a
religion
was
not
his
experience
then
suddenly
all
speculation
fled
away
in
the
presence
of
the
personal
element
three
days
ago
he
had
contemplated
the
thought
of
amy
with
comparative
indifference
she
had
been
to
him
lately
little
more
than
a
test
case
of
the
spiritual
world
clothed
about
with
the
memory
of
sentiment
now
once
more
she
sprang
into
vivid
vital
life
as
a
person
she
was
not
lost
his
relations
with
her
were
not
just
incidents
of
the
past
they
were
as
much
bound
up
with
the
present
as
courtship
has
a
continuity
with
married
life
she
existed
her
very
self
and
communication
was
possible
between
them
laurie
rolled
over
on
to
his
back
the
thought
was
violently
overwhelming
there
was
a
furious
absorbing
fascination
in
it
the
gulf
had
been
bridged
it
could
be
bridged
again
even
if
tales
were
true
it
could
be
bridged
far
more
securely
yet
it
was
possible
that
the
phantom
he
had
seen
could
be
brought
yet
more
forward
into
the
world
of
sense
that
he
could
touch
again
with
his
very
hand
a
tabernacle
enclosing
her
soul
so
far
spiritualism
had
not
failed
him
why
should
he
suspect
it
of
failure
in
the
future
it
had
been
done
before
it
could
and
should
be
done
again
besides
there
was
the
pencil
incident
he
threw
off
the
clothes
and
sprang
out
of
bed
it
was
time
to
get
up
time
to
begin
again
this
fascinating
absorbingly
interesting
earthly
life
which
now
had
such
enormous
possibilities
ii
the
rooms
of
james
morton
were
conveniently
situated
up
four
flights
of
stairs
in
one
of
those
blocks
of
buildings
so
mysterious
to
the
layman
that
lie
not
a
very
long
way
from
charing
cross
there
is
a
silence
always
here
as
of
college
life
and
the
place
is
frequented
by
the
same
curious
selections
from
the
human
race
as
haunt
university
courts
here
are
to
be
seen
cooks
aged
and
dignified
men
and
rather
shabby
old
women
the
interior
of
the
rooms
too
is
not
unlike
that
of
an
ordinary
rather
college
and
james
morton
taste
did
not
redeem
the
chambers
in
which
he
sat
from
roof
to
floor
the
particular
apartment
in
which
he
sat
was
lined
with
bookshelves
filled
with
unprepossessing
volumes
and
large
black
tin
boxes
a
large
table
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
littered
with
papers
with
bulwarks
of
the
same
kind
of
tin
boxes
rising
at
either
end
morton
himself
was
a
man
of
some
forty
years
and
rather
pale
and
stout
with
strongly
marked
features
a
good
loud
voice
and
the
pleasant
brusque
manners
that
befit
a
university
and
public
school
man
who
has
taken
seriously
to
business
laurie
and
he
got
on
excellently
together
the
younger
man
had
an
admiration
for
the
older
whose
reputation
as
a
rather
distinguished
barrister
certainly
deserved
it
and
was
sufficiently
in
awe
of
him
to
pay
attention
to
his
directions
in
all
matters
connected
with
law
but
they
did
not
meet
much
on
other
planes
laurie
had
asked
the
other
down
to
stantons
once
and
had
dined
with
him
three
or
four
times
in
return
and
there
their
acquaintance
found
its
limitations
this
morning
however
the
boy
interested
air
with
its
hints
of
suppressed
excitement
and
his
marked
inattention
to
the
books
and
papers
which
were
his
business
at
last
caused
the
older
man
to
make
a
remark
it
was
in
his
best
manner
what
the
matter
eh
he
suddenly
shot
at
him
without
prelude
of
any
kind
laurie
attention
came
back
with
a
jump
and
he
flushed
a
little
oh
er
nothing
particular
he
murmured
and
he
set
himself
down
to
his
books
again
in
silence
conscious
of
the
watchful
roving
eye
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
about
twelve
morton
shut
his
own
book
with
a
slap
leaned
back
and
began
to
fill
his
pipe
nothing
seems
very
important
he
said
as
the
last
uttered
word
had
been
spoken
an
hour
previously
laurie
was
bewildered
and
looked
it
it
wo
do
baxter
went
on
the
other
you
have
turned
a
page
an
hour
this
morning
laurie
smiled
doubtfully
and
leaned
back
too
then
he
had
a
spasm
of
confidence
yes
i
rather
upset
this
morning
he
said
the
fact
is
last
night
morton
waited
well
he
said
oh
do
tell
if
me
you
do
want
to
laurie
looked
at
him
i
wonder
what
you
say
he
said
at
last
the
other
got
up
with
an
abrupt
movement
pushed
his
books
together
selected
a
hat
and
put
it
on
i
going
to
lunch
he
said
got
to
be
in
the
courts
at
two
and
oh
wait
a
minute
said
laurie
i
think
i
want
to
tell
you
well
make
haste
he
stood
in
attitude
to
go
what
do
you
think
of
spiritualism
blasted
rot
said
morton
anything
more
i
can
do
for
you
do
you
know
anything
about
it
no
do
want
to
is
that
all
well
look
here
said
laurie
oh
sit
down
for
two
minutes
then
he
began
he
described
carefully
his
experiences
of
the
night
before
explaining
so
much
as
was
necessary
of
antecedent
events
the
other
during
the
course
of
it
tilted
his
hat
back
and
half
leaned
half
sat
against
a
watching
the
boy
at
first
with
a
genial
contempt
and
finally
with
the
same
curious
interest
that
one
gives
to
a
man
with
a
new
disease
now
what
make
of
that
ended
laurie
flushed
and
superb
want
to
know
came
after
a
short
silence
laurie
nodded
what
i
said
at
the
beginning
then
what
blasted
rot
said
morton
again
laurie
frowned
sharply
and
affected
to
put
his
books
together
of
course
if
you
take
it
like
that
he
said
but
i
do
know
what
respect
you
can
possibly
have
for
any
evidence
if
my
dear
chap
that
is
evidence
no
evidence
in
the
world
could
make
me
believe
that
the
earth
was
upside
down
these
things
happen
then
how
do
you
explain
i
do
explain
said
morton
the
thing
simply
not
worth
looking
into
if
you
really
saw
that
you
either
mad
or
else
there
was
a
trick
now
come
along
to
lunch
but
i
not
the
only
one
cried
laurie
hotly
no
indeed
you
not
look
here
baxter
that
sort
of
thing
plays
the
devil
with
nerves
just
drop
it
once
and
for
all
i
knew
a
chap
once
who
went
in
for
all
that
well
the
end
was
what
everybody
knew
would
happen
yes
said
laurie
went
off
his
chump
said
the
other
briefly
nasty
mess
all
over
the
floor
now
come
to
lunch
wait
a
second
you
ca
argue
from
particulars
to
universals
was
he
the
only
one
you
ever
knew
the
other
paused
a
moment
no
he
said
as
it
happens
he
was
i
knew
another
chap
he
a
solicitor
oh
by
the
way
he
one
of
your
people
a
catholic
i
mean
well
what
about
him
oh
he
all
right
admitted
morton
with
a
grudging
air
but
he
gave
it
up
and
took
to
religion
instead
yes
what
his
name
cathcart
he
glanced
up
at
the
clock
good
lord
he
said
ten
to
one
then
he
was
gone
laurie
was
far
too
exalted
to
be
much
depressed
by
this
opinion
and
had
indeed
several
minutes
of
delightful
meditation
on
the
crass
complacency
of
a
clever
man
when
taken
off
his
ground
it
was
deplorable
he
said
to
himself
that
men
should
be
so
content
with
their
limitations
but
it
was
always
the
way
he
reflected
to
be
a
specialist
in
one
point
involved
the
pruning
of
all
growth
on
every
other
here
was
morton
almost
in
the
front
rank
of
his
particular
subject
and
besides
very
far
from
being
a
bookworm
yet
when
taken
an
inch
out
of
his
rut
he
could
do
nothing
but
flounder
he
wondered
what
morton
would
make
of
these
things
if
he
saw
them
himself
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
morton
himself
turned
up
again
the
case
had
ended
unexpectedly
soon
laurie
waited
till
the
closing
of
the
shutters
offered
an
opportunity
for
a
break
in
the
work
and
once
more
returned
to
the
charge
morton
he
said
i
wish
you
come
with
me
one
day
the
other
looked
up
eh
to
see
for
yourself
what
i
told
you
morton
snorted
abruptly
lord
he
said
i
thought
we
done
with
that
no
thank
you
egyptian
hall
all
i
need
laurie
sighed
elaborately
oh
of
course
if
you
wo
face
facts
one
ca
expect
look
here
baxter
said
the
other
almost
kindly
i
advise
you
to
give
this
up
it
plays
the
very
devil
with
nerves
as
i
told
you
why
you
as
jumpy
as
a
cat
yourself
and
it
is
worth
it
if
there
was
anything
in
it
why
it
would
be
another
thing
but
i
i
would
give
it
up
for
all
the
world
stammered
laurie
in
his
zeal
you
simply
do
know
what
you
talking
about
why
why
i
not
a
fool
i
know
that
and
do
you
think
i
ass
enough
to
be
taken
in
by
a
trick
and
as
if
a
trick
could
be
played
like
that
in
a
i
tell
you
i
examined
every
inch
look
here
said
morton
looking
curiously
at
the
boy
for
there
was
something
rather
impressive
about
laurie
manner
look
here
better
see
old
cathcart
know
him
well
i
introduce
you
any
time
he
tell
you
another
tale
of
course
i
do
believe
all
the
rot
he
talks
but
at
any
rate
he
sensible
enough
to
have
given
it
all
up
says
he
would
touch
it
with
a
pole
and
he
was
rather
a
big
bug
at
it
in
his
time
i
believe
laurie
sneered
audibly
got
frightened
i
suppose
he
said
of
course
i
know
well
enough
that
it
rather
startling
my
dear
man
he
was
in
the
thick
of
it
for
ten
years
acknowledge
his
stories
are
if
one
believed
them
but
then
you
see
what
his
address
morton
jerked
his
head
towards
the
directories
in
the
bookshelf
find
him
there
he
said
i
give
you
an
introduction
if
you
want
it
though
mind
you
i
think
he
talks
as
much
rot
as
anyone
what
does
he
say
lord
i
do
know
some
theory
or
other
but
at
any
rate
given
it
up
laurie
pursed
his
lips
i
daresay
i
ask
you
some
time
he
said
meanwhile
meanwhile
for
the
lord
sake
get
on
with
that
business
you
got
there
morton
was
indeed
as
laurie
had
reflected
extraordinarily
uninterested
in
things
outside
his
beat
and
his
beat
was
not
a
very
extended
one
he
was
a
quite
admirable
barrister
competent
alert
merciless
and
kindly
at
the
proper
times
and
while
at
his
business
thought
of
hardly
anything
else
at
all
and
when
he
was
not
at
his
business
he
threw
himself
with
equal
zest
into
two
or
three
other
occupations
golf
dining
out
and
the
collection
of
a
particular
kind
of
chairs
beyond
these
things
there
was
for
him
really
nothing
of
value
but
owing
to
circumstances
his
beat
had
been
further
extended
to
include
laurie
baxter
whom
he
was
beginning
to
like
extremely
there
was
an
air
of
romance
about
laurie
a
pleasant
enthusiasm
excellent
manners
and
a
rather
delightful
faculty
of
morton
himself
too
while
possessing
nothing
even
resembling
a
religion
was
like
many
other
people
not
altogether
unattracted
towards
those
who
had
though
he
thought
religiousness
to
be
a
sign
of
a
slightly
incompetent
character
and
he
rather
liked
laurie
catholicism
such
as
it
was
it
must
be
rather
pleasant
he
considered
when
he
considered
it
at
all
to
believe
all
that
as
he
would
have
said
so
this
new
phase
of
laurie
interested
him
far
more
than
he
would
have
allowed
so
soon
as
he
became
aware
that
it
was
not
merely
superficial
and
indeed
laurie
constant
return
to
the
subject
as
well
as
his
air
of
enthusiastic
conviction
soon
convinced
him
that
this
was
so
further
after
a
week
or
two
he
became
aware
that
the
young
work
was
suffering
and
he
heard
from
his
lips
the
expression
of
certain
views
that
seemed
to
the
elder
man
extremely
unhealthy
for
example
on
a
friday
evening
not
much
afterwards
as
laurie
was
putting
his
books
together
morton
asked
him
where
he
was
going
to
spend
the
stopping
in
town
said
the
boy
briefly
oh
i
going
to
my
brother
cottage
care
to
come
afraid
no
catholic
church
near
laurie
smiled
that
would
deter
me
he
said
i
made
up
my
mind
yes
oh
it
does
matter
said
laurie
no
thanks
awfully
but
got
to
stop
in
town
lady
laura
again
yes
same
old
game
laurie
sat
down
look
here
he
said
i
know
you
do
mean
anything
but
i
wish
you
understand
well
the
boy
face
flushed
with
sudden
nervous
enthusiasm
do
you
understand
he
said
that
this
is
just
everything
to
me
do
you
know
it
beginning
to
seem
to
me
just
the
only
thing
that
matters
i
quite
aware
that
you
think
it
all
the
most
utter
bunkum
but
you
see
i
know
it
true
and
the
whole
thing
is
just
like
heaven
opening
look
here
i
did
tell
you
half
the
other
day
the
fact
is
that
i
was
just
as
much
in
love
with
this
girl
as
as
a
man
could
be
she
died
and
now
look
here
what
were
you
up
to
last
sunday
laurie
quieted
a
little
you
would
understand
he
said
have
you
done
any
more
of
that
business
what
business
well
thinking
you
saw
her
all
right
seeing
her
if
you
like
the
boy
shook
his
head
no
vincent
away
in
ireland
we
been
going
on
other
lines
tell
me
i
swear
i
wo
laugh
all
right
i
do
care
if
you
do
well
automatic
handwriting
what
that
laurie
hesitated
well
i
go
into
trance
you
see
and
good
lord
what
next
and
then
this
girl
writes
through
my
hand
said
laurie
deliberately
when
i
unconscious
see
i
see
you
a
damned
young
fool
said
morton
seriously
but
if
it
all
rot
as
you
think
of
course
it
all
rot
do
you
think
i
believe
for
one
instant
he
broke
off
and
so
a
nervous
breakdown
all
rot
is
it
and
they
are
real
snakes
you
know
laurie
smiled
in
a
superior
manner
and
you
getting
yourself
absorbed
in
all
this
laurie
looked
at
him
with
a
sudden
flash
of
fanaticism
i
tell
you
he
said
that
it
all
the
world
to
me
and
so
would
it
be
to
you
if
oh
lord
do
become
salvation
army
seen
cathcart
yet
no
i
have
the
least
wish
to
see
cathcart
morton
rose
put
his
pens
in
the
drawer
locked
it
slid
half
a
dozen
papers
into
a
black
tin
box
locked
that
too
and
went
towards
his
coat
and
hat
all
in
silence
as
he
went
out
he
turned
on
the
threshold
when
that
man
coming
back
from
ireland
he
said
who
vincent
oh
another
month
yet
we
going
to
have
another
try
when
he
comes
try
what
at
materialization
said
laurie
that
to
say
i
do
want
to
know
what
the
foul
thing
means
he
still
paused
looking
hard
at
the
boy
then
he
sniffed
a
young
fool
he
said
i
repeat
it
lock
up
when
you
come
good
night
i
baxter
possessed
one
of
the
two
secrets
of
serenity
the
other
need
not
be
specified
but
hers
arose
from
the
most
pleasant
and
most
human
form
of
as
has
been
said
before
when
things
did
not
fit
with
her
own
scheme
either
they
were
not
things
but
only
fancies
of
somebody
inconsiderable
or
else
she
resolutely
disregarded
them
she
had
an
opportunity
of
testing
her
serenity
on
one
day
early
in
february
she
rose
as
usual
at
a
fixed
hour
eight
and
when
she
was
ready
knelt
down
at
her
this
was
quite
an
elaborate
structure
far
more
elaborate
than
the
devotions
offered
there
it
was
a
very
beautiful
inlaid
florentine
affair
and
had
a
little
shelf
above
it
filled
with
a
number
of
the
little
books
in
which
her
soul
delighted
she
did
not
use
these
books
very
much
but
she
liked
to
see
them
there
it
would
not
be
decent
to
enter
the
sanctuary
of
baxter
prayers
it
is
enough
to
say
that
they
were
not
very
long
then
she
rose
from
her
knees
left
her
large
comfortable
bedroom
redolent
with
soap
and
hot
water
and
came
downstairs
a
beautiful
slender
little
figure
in
black
lace
veil
and
rich
dress
through
the
sunlight
of
the
staircase
into
the
there
she
took
up
her
letters
and
packets
they
were
not
exciting
there
was
an
unimportant
note
from
a
friend
a
couple
of
bills
and
a
catalogue
and
she
scrutinized
these
through
her
spectacles
sitting
by
the
fire
when
she
had
done
she
noticed
a
letter
lying
by
maggie
place
directed
in
a
masculine
hand
an
instant
later
maggie
came
in
herself
in
her
hat
and
furs
a
charming
picture
fresh
from
the
winter
sunlight
and
air
and
kissed
her
while
baxter
poured
out
tea
she
addressed
a
remark
or
two
to
the
girl
but
only
got
back
those
vague
inattentive
murmurs
that
are
the
sign
of
a
distracted
mind
and
looking
up
presently
with
a
sense
of
injury
noticed
that
maggie
was
reading
her
letter
with
extraordinary
diligence
my
dear
i
am
speaking
to
you
said
baxter
with
an
air
of
slightly
humorous
dignity
er
i
am
sorry
murmured
maggie
and
continued
reading
baxter
put
out
her
hand
for
the
catalogue
in
order
to
drive
home
her
sense
of
injury
and
met
maggie
eyes
suddenly
raised
to
meet
her
own
with
a
curious
strained
look
in
them
darling
what
is
the
matter
maggie
still
stared
at
her
a
moment
as
if
questioning
both
herself
and
the
other
and
finally
handed
the
letter
across
with
an
abrupt
movement
read
it
she
said
it
was
rather
a
business
to
read
it
it
involved
spectacles
a
pushing
aside
of
a
plate
and
a
slight
turning
to
catch
the
light
baxter
read
it
and
handed
it
back
making
three
or
four
times
the
sound
written
as
tut
the
tiresome
boy
she
said
querulously
but
without
alarm
what
are
we
to
do
you
see
morton
thinks
we
ought
to
do
something
he
mentions
a
mr
cathcart
baxter
reached
out
for
the
my
dear
there
nothing
to
be
done
you
know
what
laurie
is
only
make
him
worse
maggie
looked
at
her
uneasily
i
wish
we
could
do
something
she
said
my
dear
he
have
written
to
me
morton
i
mean
if
laurie
had
been
really
unwell
you
see
he
only
says
he
does
attend
to
his
work
as
he
ought
maggie
took
up
the
letter
put
it
carefully
back
into
the
envelope
and
went
on
with
breakfast
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
just
then
but
she
was
uneasy
and
after
breakfast
went
out
into
the
garden
spud
in
hand
to
think
it
all
over
with
the
letter
in
her
pocket
certainly
the
letter
was
not
alarming
but
that
is
to
say
taking
into
account
who
it
was
that
had
written
she
was
not
so
sure
she
had
met
morton
but
once
and
had
formed
of
him
the
kind
of
impression
that
a
girl
would
form
of
such
a
man
in
the
hours
of
a
a
brusque
ordinary
kind
of
barrister
without
much
imagination
and
a
good
deal
of
shrewd
force
it
was
surely
rather
an
extreme
step
for
a
man
like
this
to
write
to
a
girl
in
such
a
condition
of
things
asking
her
to
use
her
influence
to
dissuade
laurie
from
his
present
course
of
life
plainly
the
man
meant
what
he
said
he
had
not
written
to
baxter
as
he
explained
in
the
letter
for
fear
of
alarming
her
unduly
and
as
he
expressly
said
there
was
nothing
to
be
alarmed
about
yet
he
had
written
maggie
stopped
at
the
lower
end
of
the
orchard
path
took
out
the
letter
and
read
the
last
three
or
four
sentences
again
please
forgive
me
if
you
think
it
was
unnecessary
to
write
of
course
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
whole
thing
is
nothing
but
nonsense
but
even
nonsense
can
have
a
bad
effect
and
baxter
seems
to
me
to
be
far
too
much
wrapped
up
in
it
i
enclose
the
address
of
a
friend
of
mine
in
case
you
would
care
to
write
to
him
on
the
subject
he
was
once
a
spiritualist
and
is
now
a
devout
catholic
he
takes
a
view
of
it
that
i
do
not
take
but
at
any
rate
his
advice
could
do
no
harm
you
can
trust
him
to
be
absolutely
discreet
believe
me
yours
sincerely
james
morton
it
really
was
very
odd
and
unconventional
and
morton
had
not
seemed
at
all
an
odd
or
unconventional
person
he
mentioned
too
a
particular
date
february
as
the
date
by
which
the
medium
would
have
returned
and
some
sort
of
further
effort
was
going
to
be
made
but
he
did
not
attempt
to
explain
this
nor
did
maggie
understand
it
it
only
seemed
to
her
rather
sinister
and
unpleasant
she
turned
over
the
page
and
there
was
the
address
he
had
mentioned
a
cathcart
surely
he
did
not
expect
her
to
write
to
this
stranger
she
walked
up
and
down
with
her
spud
for
another
before
she
could
come
to
any
conclusion
certainly
she
agreed
with
james
morton
that
the
whole
thing
was
nonsense
yet
further
that
this
nonsense
was
capable
of
doing
a
good
deal
of
harm
to
an
excitable
person
besides
laurie
obviously
had
a
bad
conscience
about
it
or
he
would
have
mentioned
it
she
caught
sight
of
baxter
presently
through
the
thick
hedge
walking
with
her
dainty
dignified
step
along
the
paths
of
the
kitchen
garden
and
a
certain
impatience
seized
her
at
the
sight
this
mother
was
so
annoyingly
serene
surely
it
was
her
business
rather
than
maggie
own
to
look
after
laurie
yet
the
girl
knew
perfectly
well
that
if
laurie
was
left
to
his
mother
nothing
at
all
would
be
done
baxter
would
deplore
it
all
of
course
gently
and
tranquilly
in
laurie
absence
and
would
perhaps
if
she
were
hard
pressed
utter
a
feeble
protest
even
in
his
presence
and
that
was
absolutely
all
maggie
maggie
came
the
gentle
old
voice
calling
presently
and
then
to
some
unseen
person
have
you
seen
miss
deronnais
anywhere
maggie
put
the
letter
in
her
pocket
and
hurried
through
from
the
orchard
yes
she
said
with
a
half
hope
come
in
my
dear
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
those
new
teacups
in
the
catalogue
said
the
old
lady
there
seem
some
beautiful
new
designs
and
we
want
another
set
maggie
bowed
to
the
inevitable
but
as
they
passed
up
the
garden
her
resolution
was
precipitated
can
you
let
me
go
by
twelve
she
said
i
rather
want
to
see
father
mahon
about
something
my
dear
i
shall
not
keep
you
three
minutes
protested
the
old
lady
and
they
went
in
to
talk
for
an
hour
and
ii
father
mahon
was
a
conscientious
priest
he
said
his
mass
at
eight
he
breakfasted
at
nine
he
performed
certain
devotions
till
ten
read
the
paper
till
eleven
and
theology
till
twelve
then
he
considered
himself
at
liberty
to
do
what
he
liked
till
his
dinner
at
one
the
rest
of
his
day
does
not
concern
us
just
now
he
too
was
looking
round
his
garden
this
morning
a
fine
solid
figure
of
a
man
in
rather
baggy
trousers
short
coat
and
expansive
waistcoat
with
every
button
doing
its
duty
he
too
like
james
morton
had
his
beat
an
even
narrower
one
than
the
barrister
and
even
better
trodden
for
he
never
strayed
off
it
at
all
except
for
four
short
weeks
in
the
summer
when
he
hurried
across
to
ireland
and
got
up
late
and
went
on
picnics
with
other
ecclesiastics
in
straw
hats
and
joined
in
cheerful
songs
in
the
evening
he
was
a
priest
with
perfectly
defined
duties
and
of
admirable
punctuality
and
conscientiousness
in
doing
them
he
disliked
the
english
quite
extraordinarily
but
his
sense
of
duty
was
such
that
they
never
suspected
it
and
his
flock
of
saxons
adored
him
as
people
only
can
adore
a
brisk
businesslike
man
with
a
large
heart
and
peremptory
ways
who
is
their
guide
and
father
and
is
perfectly
aware
of
it
his
sermons
consisted
of
blocks
of
dogma
taken
perseveringly
from
sermon
outlines
and
served
up
sunday
by
sunday
with
a
sauce
of
a
slight
and
delightful
brogue
he
could
never
have
kindled
the
thames
nor
indeed
any
river
at
all
but
he
could
bridge
them
with
solid
stones
and
this
is
perhaps
even
more
desirable
maggie
had
begun
by
disliking
him
she
had
thought
him
rather
coarse
and
stupid
but
she
had
changed
her
mind
he
was
not
what
may
be
called
subtle
he
had
no
patience
at
all
with
such
things
as
scruples
and
shades
of
tone
and
meaning
but
if
you
put
a
plain
question
to
him
plainly
he
gave
you
a
plain
answer
if
he
knew
it
if
not
he
looked
it
up
then
and
there
and
that
is
always
a
relief
in
this
intricate
world
maggie
therefore
did
not
bother
him
much
she
went
to
him
only
on
plain
issues
and
he
respected
and
liked
her
accordingly
good
morning
my
child
he
said
in
his
loud
breezy
voice
as
he
came
in
to
find
her
in
his
hideous
little
i
hope
you
do
mind
the
smell
of
the
room
indeed
reeked
he
had
started
a
cigar
according
to
rule
as
the
clock
struck
twelve
and
had
left
it
just
now
upon
a
stump
outside
when
his
housekeeper
had
come
to
announce
a
visitor
not
in
the
least
thanks
father
may
i
sit
down
it
rather
a
long
business
i
afraid
the
priest
pulled
out
an
covered
with
horsehair
and
an
antimacassar
sit
down
my
child
then
he
sat
down
himself
opposite
her
in
his
trousers
at
once
tight
and
baggy
with
his
rather
large
boots
cocked
one
over
the
other
and
his
genial
red
face
smiling
at
her
now
then
he
said
it
not
about
myself
father
she
began
rather
hurriedly
about
laurie
baxter
may
i
begin
at
the
beginning
he
nodded
he
was
not
sorry
to
hear
something
about
this
boy
whom
he
did
like
at
all
but
for
whom
he
knew
himself
at
least
partly
responsible
the
english
were
bad
enough
but
english
converts
were
indescribably
trying
and
laurie
had
been
on
his
mind
lately
he
scarcely
knew
why
then
maggie
began
at
the
beginning
and
told
the
whole
thing
from
amy
death
down
to
morton
letter
he
put
a
question
or
two
to
her
during
her
story
looking
at
her
with
pressed
lips
and
finally
put
out
his
hand
for
the
letter
itself
baxter
does
know
what
i
come
about
said
the
girl
you
wo
give
her
a
hint
will
you
father
he
nodded
reassuringly
to
her
absorbed
in
the
letter
and
presently
handed
it
back
with
a
large
smile
he
seems
a
sensible
fellow
he
said
ah
that
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you
father
i
do
know
anything
at
all
about
spiritualism
is
it
is
it
really
all
nonsense
is
there
nothing
in
it
at
all
he
laughed
aloud
i
do
think
you
need
be
afraid
he
said
of
course
we
know
that
souls
do
come
back
like
that
they
somewhere
else
then
it
all
fraud
it
practically
all
fraud
he
said
but
it
very
superstitious
and
is
forbidden
by
the
church
this
was
straight
enough
it
was
at
least
a
clear
issue
to
begin
to
attack
laurie
upon
then
then
that
the
evil
of
it
she
said
there
no
real
power
underneath
that
what
rymer
said
to
baxter
and
it
what
i
always
thought
myself
the
priest
face
became
theological
let
see
what
sabetti
says
he
said
i
fancy
he
turned
in
his
chair
and
fetched
out
a
volume
behind
him
here
we
are
he
ran
his
finger
down
the
heavy
paragraphs
turned
a
page
or
two
and
began
a
running
comment
and
translation
arising
from
invocation
of
the
dead
let
see
yes
or
the
consulting
of
spirits
in
order
to
know
hidden
things
especially
that
pertain
to
the
future
life
certainly
is
divination
properly
so
called
and
is
is
full
of
even
more
impiety
than
is
magnetism
or
the
use
of
turning
tables
the
reason
is
as
the
baltimore
fathers
testify
that
such
knowledge
must
necessarily
be
ascribed
to
satanic
intervention
since
in
no
other
manner
can
it
be
explained
then
began
maggie
one
moment
my
child
yes
just
so
divination
no
no
ah
here
we
are
divination
even
if
it
is
openly
protested
that
no
commerce
with
the
demon
is
intended
is
grave
sin
but
it
can
sometimes
be
excused
from
mortal
sin
on
account
of
simplicity
or
ignorance
or
a
lack
of
certain
faith
you
see
my
child
he
set
the
book
back
in
its
place
so
far
as
it
not
fraud
it
diabolical
and
that
an
end
of
it
but
do
you
think
it
not
all
fraud
then
asked
the
girl
paling
a
little
he
laughed
again
with
a
resonance
that
warmed
her
heart
i
should
pay
just
no
attention
to
it
all
tell
him
if
you
like
what
i
said
and
that
it
grave
sin
for
him
to
play
with
it
but
get
thinking
that
the
devil
in
everything
maggie
was
puzzled
then
it
not
the
devil
she
asked
at
least
not
in
this
case
you
think
he
smiled
again
reassuringly
i
should
suspect
it
was
a
clever
trick
he
said
i
do
think
master
laurie
likely
to
get
mixed
up
with
the
devil
in
that
way
there
plenty
of
easier
ways
than
that
do
you
think
i
should
write
to
mr
cathcart
just
as
you
like
he
a
convert
is
he
i
believe
i
heard
his
name
i
think
so
well
it
would
do
any
harm
though
i
should
suspect
not
much
good
maggie
was
silent
just
tell
master
laurie
not
to
play
tricks
said
the
priest
got
a
good
sensible
friend
in
morton
i
can
see
that
and
trouble
your
head
too
much
about
it
my
child
when
maggie
was
gone
he
went
out
to
finish
his
cigar
and
found
to
his
pleasure
that
it
was
still
alight
and
after
a
puff
or
two
it
went
very
well
he
thought
about
his
interview
for
a
few
minutes
as
he
walked
up
and
down
taking
the
bright
winter
air
it
explained
a
good
deal
he
had
begun
to
be
a
little
anxious
about
this
boy
it
was
not
that
laurie
had
actually
neglected
his
religion
while
at
stantons
he
was
always
in
his
place
at
mass
on
sundays
and
even
very
occasionally
on
weekdays
as
well
and
he
had
had
a
mass
said
for
amy
nugent
but
even
as
far
back
as
the
beginning
of
the
previous
year
there
had
been
an
air
about
him
not
altogether
reassuring
well
this
at
any
rate
was
a
small
commentary
on
the
present
situation
the
priest
stopped
to
look
at
some
bulbs
that
were
coming
up
in
the
bed
beside
him
and
stooped
breathing
heavily
to
smooth
the
earth
round
one
of
them
with
a
large
and
as
for
this
spiritualistic
nonsense
of
course
the
whole
thing
was
a
trick
things
did
not
happen
like
that
of
course
the
devil
could
do
extraordinary
things
or
at
any
rate
had
been
able
to
do
them
in
the
past
but
as
for
master
laurie
baxter
whose
home
was
down
there
in
the
hamlet
and
who
had
been
at
oxford
and
was
now
reading
law
as
for
the
thought
that
this
rather
superior
saxon
young
man
was
in
direct
communication
with
satan
at
the
present
time
well
that
needed
no
comment
but
loud
laughter
yet
it
was
very
unwholesome
and
unhealthy
that
was
the
worst
of
these
converts
they
could
not
be
content
with
the
sober
workaday
facts
of
the
catholic
creed
they
must
be
always
running
after
some
novelty
or
other
and
it
was
mortal
sin
anyhow
if
the
sinner
had
the
faintest
idea
a
large
pealed
from
the
back
door
and
the
priest
went
in
to
roast
beef
with
yorkshire
pudding
apple
dumplings
and
a
single
glass
of
to
end
up
with
iii
it
was
strange
how
maggie
felt
steadied
and
encouraged
in
the
presence
of
something
at
least
resembling
danger
so
long
as
laurie
was
merely
tiresome
and
foolish
she
distrusted
herself
she
made
little
rules
and
resolutions
and
deliberately
kept
herself
interiorly
detached
from
him
but
now
that
there
was
something
definite
to
look
to
her
sensitiveness
vanished
as
to
what
that
something
was
she
did
not
trust
herself
to
decide
father
mahon
had
given
her
a
point
to
work
at
the
fact
that
the
thing
as
a
serious
pursuit
was
forbidden
as
to
what
the
reality
behind
was
whether
indeed
there
were
any
reality
at
all
she
did
not
allow
herself
to
consider
laurie
was
in
a
state
of
nerves
sufficiently
troublesome
to
bring
a
letter
from
his
friend
and
guide
and
he
was
in
that
state
through
playing
tricks
on
forbidden
ground
that
was
enough
her
interview
with
father
mahon
precipitated
her
resolution
and
after
tea
she
went
upstairs
to
write
to
cathcart
it
was
an
unconventional
thing
to
do
but
she
was
sufficiently
perturbed
to
disregard
that
drawback
and
she
wrote
a
very
sensible
letter
explaining
first
who
she
was
then
without
any
names
being
mentioned
she
described
her
adopted
brother
position
and
indicated
his
experiences
she
occupied
the
last
page
in
asking
two
or
three
questions
and
begging
for
general
advice
baxter
displayed
some
symptoms
after
dinner
which
the
girl
recognized
well
enough
they
comprised
a
resolute
avoidance
of
laurie
name
a
funny
stiff
little
air
of
dignity
and
a
touch
of
patronage
and
the
interpretation
of
these
things
was
that
the
old
lady
did
not
wish
the
subject
to
be
mentioned
again
and
that
interiorly
she
was
doing
her
best
ignore
and
forget
it
maggie
felt
again
vaguely
comforted
it
left
her
a
freer
hand
she
lay
awake
a
long
time
that
night
her
room
was
a
little
square
one
on
the
top
of
the
stairs
above
the
where
she
had
that
odd
scene
with
laurie
a
month
or
so
before
and
looking
out
upon
the
yew
walk
that
led
to
the
orchard
it
was
a
cheerful
little
place
enough
papered
in
brown
hung
all
over
with
water
colors
with
her
bed
in
one
corner
and
it
looked
a
reassuring
familiar
kind
of
place
in
the
firelight
as
she
lay
and
thinking
it
was
not
that
she
was
at
all
frightened
it
was
no
more
than
a
little
natural
anxiety
and
half
a
dozen
times
in
the
hour
or
two
that
she
lay
thinking
she
turned
resolutely
over
in
bed
dismissed
the
little
pictures
that
her
mind
formed
in
spite
of
herself
and
began
to
think
of
pleasant
sane
subjects
but
the
images
recurred
they
were
no
more
than
little
vignettes
laurie
talking
to
a
tall
man
with
a
sardonic
smile
laurie
having
tea
with
stapleton
laurie
in
an
empty
room
looking
at
a
closed
door
it
was
this
last
picture
that
recurred
three
or
four
times
at
the
very
instant
that
the
girl
was
drowsing
off
into
sleep
and
it
had
therefore
that
particular
vividness
that
characterizes
the
thoughts
when
the
conscious
attention
is
dormant
it
had
too
a
strangely
perturbing
effect
upon
her
and
she
could
not
imagine
why
after
the
third
return
of
it
her
sense
of
humor
came
to
the
rescue
it
was
too
ridiculous
she
said
to
be
alarmed
at
an
empty
room
and
laurie
back
once
more
she
turned
on
her
side
away
from
the
firelight
and
resolved
if
it
recurred
again
to
examine
the
details
closely
again
the
moments
passed
thought
followed
thought
in
those
quiet
waves
that
lull
the
mind
towards
sleep
finally
once
more
the
picture
was
there
clear
and
distinct
yes
she
would
look
at
it
this
time
it
was
a
bare
room
wainscoted
round
the
walls
a
few
inches
up
papered
beyond
in
some
common
palish
pattern
laurie
stood
in
the
center
of
the
uncarpeted
boards
with
his
back
turned
to
her
looking
it
seemed
with
an
intense
expectation
at
the
very
dull
door
in
the
wall
opposite
him
he
was
in
his
evening
dress
she
saw
and
buckles
all
complete
and
his
hands
were
clenched
as
they
hung
held
out
a
little
from
his
sides
as
he
himself
crouching
a
little
stared
at
the
door
she
too
looked
at
the
door
at
its
conventional
panels
and
its
brass
handle
and
it
appeared
to
her
as
if
both
he
and
she
were
expectant
of
some
visitor
the
door
would
open
presently
she
perceived
and
the
reason
why
laurie
was
so
intent
upon
the
entrance
was
that
he
no
more
than
she
had
any
idea
as
to
the
character
of
the
person
who
was
to
come
in
she
became
quite
interested
as
she
watched
it
was
a
method
she
followed
sometimes
when
wooing
sleep
and
she
began
in
her
fancy
to
go
past
laurie
as
if
to
open
the
door
but
as
she
passed
him
she
was
aware
that
he
put
out
a
hand
to
check
her
as
if
to
hold
her
back
from
some
danger
and
she
stopped
hesitating
still
looking
not
at
laurie
but
at
the
door
she
began
then
with
the
irresponsibility
of
deepening
sleep
to
imagine
instead
what
lay
beyond
the
door
to
perceive
by
intuitive
vision
the
character
of
the
house
she
got
so
far
as
understanding
that
it
was
all
as
unfurnished
as
this
room
that
the
house
stood
solitary
among
trees
and
that
even
these
and
the
tangled
garden
that
she
determined
must
surround
the
house
were
as
listening
and
as
expectant
as
herself
and
the
waiting
figure
of
the
boy
once
more
as
if
to
verify
her
imaginative
excursion
she
moved
to
the
door
ah
what
nonsense
it
was
here
she
was
wide
awake
again
in
her
own
familiar
room
with
the
firelight
on
the
walls
well
well
sleep
was
a
curious
thing
and
so
was
imagination
at
any
rate
she
had
written
to
cathcart
i
the
cock
inn
is
situated
in
fleet
street
not
twenty
yards
from
mitre
court
and
scarcely
fifty
from
the
passage
that
leads
down
to
the
court
where
james
morton
still
has
his
chambers
it
was
a
convenient
place
therefore
for
laurie
to
lunch
in
and
he
generally
made
his
appearance
there
a
few
minutes
before
one
to
partake
of
a
small
rump
steak
and
a
pewter
mug
of
beer
sometimes
he
came
alone
sometimes
in
company
and
by
a
carefully
thought
out
system
of
tips
he
usually
managed
to
have
reserved
for
him
at
least
until
one
a
particular
seat
in
a
particular
partition
in
that
row
of
shelters
that
run
the
length
of
the
room
opposite
the
door
on
the
first
floor
on
the
of
february
however
it
was
a
friday
by
the
way
and
boiled
plaice
would
have
to
be
eaten
instead
of
rump
steak
he
was
a
little
annoyed
to
find
his
seat
already
occupied
by
a
small
man
with
a
grey
beard
and
spectacles
who
with
a
newspaper
propped
in
front
of
him
was
also
engaged
in
the
consumption
of
boiled
plaice
the
little
man
looked
up
at
him
sharply
like
a
bird
disturbed
in
a
meal
and
then
down
again
upon
the
paper
laurie
noticed
that
his
hat
and
stick
were
laid
upon
the
adjoining
chair
as
if
to
retain
it
he
hesitated
an
instant
then
he
slid
in
on
the
other
side
opposite
the
stranger
tapped
his
glass
with
his
knife
and
sat
down
when
the
waiter
came
a
familiarly
deferential
man
with
whiskers
laurie
with
a
slight
look
of
peevishness
gave
his
order
and
glanced
reproachfully
at
the
occupied
seat
the
waiter
gave
the
ghost
of
a
shrug
with
his
shoulders
significant
of
apologetic
helplessness
and
went
away
a
minute
later
morton
entered
glanced
this
way
and
that
nodding
imperceptibly
to
laurie
and
was
just
moving
off
to
a
less
occupied
table
when
the
stranger
looked
up
morton
he
cried
mr
morton
in
an
odd
voice
that
seemed
on
the
point
of
cracking
into
falsetto
certainly
he
was
very
like
a
portly
bird
thought
laurie
the
other
turned
round
nodded
with
short
geniality
and
slid
into
the
chair
from
which
the
old
man
moved
his
hat
and
stick
with
zealous
haste
and
what
are
you
doing
here
said
morton
just
taking
a
bite
like
yourself
said
the
other
friday
worse
luck
laurie
was
conscious
of
a
touch
of
interest
this
man
was
a
catholic
then
he
supposed
oh
by
the
way
said
morton
have
you
er
and
he
indicated
laurie
no
baxter
let
me
introduce
mr
cathcart
for
a
moment
the
name
meant
nothing
to
laurie
then
he
remembered
but
his
rising
suspicions
were
quelled
instantly
by
his
friend
next
remark
by
the
way
cathcart
we
were
talking
of
you
a
week
or
two
ago
indeed
i
am
flattered
said
the
old
man
perkily
yes
perky
was
the
word
thought
laurie
baxter
here
is
interested
in
spiritualism
rump
steak
waiter
and
pint
of
bitter
and
i
told
him
you
were
the
man
for
him
laurie
interiorly
drew
in
his
horns
a
er
an
experimenter
asked
the
old
man
with
courteous
interest
his
eyes
giving
a
quick
gleam
beneath
his
glasses
a
little
yes
most
dangerous
most
dangerous
and
any
success
mr
baxter
laurie
felt
his
annoyance
deepen
very
considerable
success
he
said
shortly
ah
yes
you
must
forgive
me
sir
but
i
have
had
a
good
deal
of
experience
and
i
must
say
you
are
a
catholic
i
see
he
said
interrupting
himself
or
a
high
churchman
i
am
a
catholic
said
laurie
so
i
but
i
gave
up
spiritualism
as
soon
as
i
became
one
very
interesting
experiences
too
but
well
i
value
my
soul
too
much
mr
baxter
morton
put
a
large
piece
of
potato
into
his
mouth
with
a
detached
air
it
was
really
rather
trying
thought
laurie
to
be
catechized
in
this
way
so
he
determined
to
show
superiority
and
you
think
it
all
superstition
and
nonsense
he
asked
indeed
no
said
the
old
man
shortly
laurie
pushed
his
plate
on
one
side
and
drew
the
cheese
towards
him
this
was
a
little
more
interesting
he
thought
but
he
was
still
far
from
feeling
communicative
what
then
he
asked
oh
very
real
indeed
said
the
old
man
that
is
just
the
danger
the
danger
yes
baxter
of
course
there
plenty
of
fraud
and
trickery
we
all
know
that
but
it
the
part
that
not
fraud
that
may
i
ask
what
medium
you
go
to
i
know
vincent
and
i
been
to
some
public
too
the
old
man
looked
at
him
with
sudden
interest
but
said
nothing
you
think
he
not
honest
said
laurie
with
cool
offensiveness
oh
yes
he
perfectly
honest
said
the
other
deliberately
trouble
you
for
the
sugar
mr
morton
laurie
was
determined
not
to
begin
the
subject
again
he
felt
that
he
was
being
patronized
and
lectured
and
did
not
like
it
and
once
again
the
suspicion
crossed
his
mind
that
this
was
an
arranged
meeting
it
was
so
very
neat
two
days
before
the
the
entry
of
morton
his
own
seat
occupied
yet
he
did
not
feel
quite
courageous
enough
to
challenge
either
of
them
he
ate
his
cheese
deliberately
and
waited
listening
to
the
talk
between
the
two
on
quite
irrelevant
subjects
and
presently
determined
on
a
bit
of
bravado
may
i
look
at
the
mr
cathcart
he
asked
there
is
no
doubt
of
his
guilt
the
old
man
said
as
he
handed
the
paper
across
the
two
were
deep
in
a
law
case
now
i
said
so
to
markham
a
dozen
times
and
so
on
but
there
was
no
more
word
of
spiritualism
laurie
propped
the
paper
before
him
as
he
finished
his
cheese
and
waited
for
coffee
and
read
with
unseeing
eyes
he
was
resenting
as
hard
as
he
could
the
abruptness
of
the
opening
and
closing
of
the
subject
and
the
complete
disregard
now
shown
to
him
he
drank
his
coffee
still
leisurely
and
lit
a
cigarette
and
still
the
two
talked
he
stood
up
at
last
and
reached
down
his
hat
and
stick
the
old
man
looked
up
you
are
going
baxter
good
day
well
then
and
as
i
was
waiting
in
court
laurie
passed
out
indignantly
and
went
down
the
stairs
so
that
was
cathcart
well
he
was
thankful
he
had
written
to
him
after
all
he
was
not
his
kind
in
the
least
ii
the
moment
he
passed
out
of
the
door
the
old
man
stopped
his
fluent
talking
and
waited
looking
after
the
boy
then
he
turned
again
to
his
friend
i
a
blundering
idiot
he
said
morton
sniffed
i
put
him
against
me
now
lord
knows
how
but
i
done
it
and
he
wo
listen
to
me
gad
said
morton
what
funny
people
you
all
are
and
you
really
meant
what
you
said
every
word
said
the
old
man
cheerfully
well
our
little
over
why
do
you
ask
him
to
come
and
see
you
first
said
the
old
man
with
the
same
unruffled
cheerfulness
he
would
have
come
we
muddled
it
we
much
better
have
been
straightforward
secondly
he
thinks
me
an
old
fool
as
you
do
only
more
so
no
we
must
set
to
work
some
other
way
now
tell
me
about
miss
deronnais
i
showed
you
her
letter
the
other
nodded
helping
himself
to
cheese
i
told
her
that
i
was
at
her
service
of
course
and
i
have
heard
again
sensible
girl
very
sensible
i
should
say
sort
of
girl
that
would
scream
or
faint
in
a
crisis
exactly
the
opposite
i
should
say
but
i
hardly
seen
her
you
know
well
well
and
the
mother
no
good
at
all
said
morton
then
the
girl
the
sheet
anchor
in
love
with
him
do
you
know
lord
how
expect
me
to
know
that
the
old
man
pondered
in
silence
seeming
to
assimilate
the
situation
he
in
a
devil
of
a
mess
he
said
with
abrupt
cheerfulness
that
man
vincent
well
he
the
most
dangerous
of
the
lot
just
because
he
honest
good
god
broke
in
the
other
again
suddenly
do
all
catholics
believe
this
rubbish
my
dear
friend
of
course
they
do
not
one
in
a
thousand
i
wish
they
did
that
what
the
matter
but
they
laugh
at
it
laugh
at
it
his
voice
cracked
into
shrill
falsetto
laugh
at
is
sunday
the
day
did
you
say
he
told
me
the
and
at
that
woman
in
queen
gate
i
suppose
expect
so
he
did
say
or
i
forget
i
heard
they
were
at
their
games
there
again
said
cathcart
with
meditative
geniality
i
like
to
blow
up
the
stinking
hole
morton
chuckled
audibly
you
the
youngest
man
of
your
years
i
ever
come
across
he
said
no
wonder
you
believe
all
that
stuff
when
are
you
going
to
grow
up
cathcart
the
old
man
paid
no
attention
at
all
well
that
plot
over
he
said
again
now
for
miss
deronnais
but
we
ca
stop
this
sunday
affair
that
certain
did
he
tell
you
anything
about
it
materialization
automatic
lord
i
do
know
all
that
jargon
my
dear
morton
for
a
lawyer
you
the
worst
witness
ever
well
i
off
no
more
to
be
done
today
the
other
sat
on
a
few
minutes
over
his
pipe
it
seemed
to
him
quite
amazing
that
a
sensible
man
like
cathcart
could
take
such
rubbish
seriously
in
every
other
department
of
life
the
solicitor
was
an
eminently
shrewd
and
sane
man
with
moreover
a
youthful
kind
of
brisk
humor
that
is
perhaps
the
surest
symptom
of
sanity
that
it
is
possible
to
have
he
had
seen
him
in
court
for
years
past
under
every
sort
of
circumstance
and
if
it
had
been
required
of
him
to
select
a
character
with
which
superstition
and
morbid
humbug
could
have
had
nothing
in
common
he
would
have
laid
his
hand
upon
the
senior
partner
of
cathcart
and
cathcart
yet
here
was
this
sane
man
taking
this
fantastic
nonsense
as
if
there
were
really
something
in
it
he
had
first
heard
him
speak
of
the
subject
at
a
small
bachelor
dinner
party
of
four
in
the
rooms
of
a
mutual
friend
and
as
he
had
listened
he
had
had
the
same
sensation
as
one
would
have
upon
hearing
a
cabinet
minister
let
us
say
discussing
with
enthusiasm
cathcart
had
said
all
kinds
of
things
when
once
he
was
started
all
with
that
air
of
businesslike
briskness
that
was
so
characteristic
of
him
and
so
disconcerting
in
such
a
connection
if
he
had
apologized
for
it
as
an
amiable
weakness
if
he
had
been
in
the
least
shamefaced
or
deprecatory
it
would
have
been
another
matter
one
would
have
forgiven
it
as
one
forgives
any
little
exceptional
eccentricity
but
to
hear
him
speak
of
materialization
as
of
a
process
as
normal
though
unusual
as
the
production
of
radium
and
of
planchette
as
of
wireless
telegraphy
as
established
indubitable
facts
though
out
of
the
range
of
common
experience
this
had
amazed
this
very
practical
man
cathcart
had
hinted
too
of
other
things
things
which
he
would
not
amplify
of
a
still
more
disconcertingly
impossible
nature
matters
which
morton
had
scarcely
thought
had
been
credible
even
to
the
darkest
medievalists
and
all
this
with
that
same
sharp
sane
humor
that
lent
an
air
of
reality
to
all
that
he
said
for
romantic
young
asses
like
laurie
baxter
such
things
were
not
so
hopelessly
incongruous
though
obviously
they
were
bad
for
him
they
were
all
part
of
the
wild
credulousness
of
a
religious
youth
but
for
cathcart
aged
a
solicitor
in
good
practice
with
a
wife
and
two
daughters
and
a
reputation
for
exceptionally
sound
shrewdness
but
it
must
be
remembered
he
was
a
catholic
so
james
morton
sat
in
the
cock
and
pondered
he
was
not
sorry
he
had
tried
to
take
steps
to
choke
off
this
young
fool
and
he
was
just
a
little
sorry
that
so
far
they
had
failed
he
had
written
to
miss
deronnais
in
an
impulse
after
an
unusually
feverish
outburst
from
the
boy
and
she
he
had
learnt
later
had
written
to
cathcart
the
rest
had
been
of
the
other
devising
well
it
had
failed
so
far
perhaps
next
week
things
would
be
better
he
paid
his
bill
left
two
pence
for
the
waiter
and
went
out
he
had
a
case
that
afternoon
iii
laurie
left
chambers
as
it
was
growing
dark
that
afternoon
and
went
back
to
his
rooms
for
tea
he
had
passed
as
was
usual
now
an
extremely
distracted
couple
of
hours
sitting
over
his
books
with
spasmodic
efforts
only
to
attend
to
them
he
was
beginning
in
fact
to
be
not
quite
sure
whether
law
after
all
was
his
vocation
his
kettle
was
singing
pleasantly
on
the
hob
and
a
tray
glimmered
in
the
firelight
on
the
little
table
as
the
woman
had
left
it
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
poured
himself
out
a
cup
of
tea
that
he
saw
on
the
white
cloth
an
envelope
directed
to
him
inscribed
by
hand
in
the
usual
handwriting
of
persons
engaged
in
business
even
then
he
did
not
open
it
at
once
it
was
probably
only
some
note
connected
with
his
chief
affairs
for
half
an
hour
more
he
sat
on
smoking
after
tea
pondering
that
which
was
always
in
his
mind
now
and
dwelling
with
a
vague
pleasant
expectancy
on
what
sunday
night
should
bring
forth
vincent
he
knew
was
returning
to
town
that
afternoon
perhaps
even
he
might
look
in
for
a
few
minutes
if
there
were
any
last
instructions
to
be
given
the
effect
of
the
medium
on
the
young
man
mind
had
increased
enormously
during
these
past
weeks
that
air
of
virile
masterfulness
all
the
more
impressive
because
of
its
extreme
quiet
assurance
had
proved
even
more
deep
than
had
at
first
appeared
it
is
very
hard
to
analyze
the
elements
of
a
boy
adoration
for
a
solid
gentleman
with
a
personality
yet
the
thing
is
an
enormously
potent
fact
and
plays
at
least
as
big
a
part
in
the
that
run
about
the
world
as
any
more
normal
human
emotions
psychologists
of
the
materialistic
school
would
probably
say
that
it
was
a
survival
of
the
instinct
at
any
rate
there
it
is
added
to
all
this
was
the
peculiar
relation
in
which
the
medium
stood
to
the
boy
it
was
he
who
had
first
opened
the
door
towards
that
strange
other
world
that
so
persistently
haunts
the
imaginations
of
certain
temperaments
it
was
through
him
that
laurie
had
had
brought
before
the
evidence
of
his
senses
as
he
thought
the
actuality
of
the
things
of
which
he
had
dreamed
an
actuality
which
his
religion
had
somehow
succeeded
in
evading
it
was
not
that
laurie
had
been
insincere
in
his
religion
there
had
been
moments
and
there
still
were
occasionally
when
the
world
that
the
catholic
religion
preached
by
word
and
symbol
and
sacrament
became
apparent
but
the
whole
thing
was
upon
a
different
plane
religion
bade
him
approach
in
one
way
spiritualism
in
the
other
the
senses
had
nothing
to
do
with
one
they
were
the
only
ultimate
channels
of
the
other
and
it
is
extraordinarily
easy
for
human
beings
to
regard
as
more
fundamentally
real
the
evidence
of
the
senses
than
the
evidence
of
faith
here
then
were
the
two
choices
a
world
of
spirit
to
be
taken
largely
on
trust
to
be
discerned
only
in
shadow
and
outline
upon
rare
and
unusual
occasions
of
exaltation
of
a
particular
quality
which
had
almost
lost
its
appeal
and
a
world
of
spirit
that
took
shape
and
form
and
practical
intelligibility
in
ordinary
rooms
and
under
very
nearly
ordinary
circumstances
a
world
in
short
not
of
a
transcendent
god
and
the
spirits
of
just
men
made
perfect
of
vast
dogmas
and
theories
but
of
a
familiar
atmosphere
impregnated
with
experience
inhabited
by
known
souls
who
in
this
method
or
that
made
themselves
apparent
to
those
senses
which
laurie
believed
could
not
lie
and
the
point
of
contact
was
amy
nugent
herself
as
regards
his
exact
attitude
to
this
girl
it
is
more
difficult
to
write
on
the
one
side
the
human
element
those
associations
directly
connected
with
the
senses
her
actual
face
and
hands
physical
atmosphere
and
surroundings
those
had
disappeared
they
were
dispersed
or
they
lay
underground
and
it
had
been
with
a
certain
shock
of
surprise
in
spite
of
the
explanations
given
to
him
that
he
had
seen
what
he
believed
to
be
her
face
in
the
in
queen
gate
but
he
had
tried
to
arrange
all
this
in
his
imagination
and
it
had
fallen
into
shape
and
proportion
again
in
short
he
thought
he
understood
now
that
it
is
character
which
gives
unity
to
the
transient
qualities
of
a
person
on
earth
and
that
when
those
qualities
disappear
it
is
as
unimportant
as
the
wasting
of
tissue
when
according
to
the
spiritualists
gospel
that
character
manifests
itself
from
the
other
side
it
naturally
reconstitutes
the
form
by
which
it
had
been
recognized
on
earth
yet
in
spite
of
this
sense
of
familiarity
with
what
he
had
seen
there
had
fallen
between
amy
and
himself
that
august
shadow
that
is
called
death
and
in
spite
of
the
assurances
he
had
received
even
at
the
hands
of
his
own
senses
that
this
was
indeed
the
same
girl
that
he
had
known
on
earth
there
was
a
strange
awe
mingled
with
his
old
rather
shallow
passion
there
were
moments
as
he
sat
alone
in
his
rooms
at
night
when
it
rose
almost
to
terror
just
as
there
were
other
moments
when
awe
vanished
for
a
while
and
his
whole
being
was
flooded
with
an
extraordinary
ecstatic
happiness
at
the
thought
that
he
and
she
could
yet
speak
with
one
another
imagine
if
you
please
a
child
who
on
returning
home
finds
that
his
mother
has
become
queen
and
meets
her
in
the
glory
of
ermine
and
diadem
but
the
real
deciding
point
which
somehow
he
knew
must
come
the
moment
at
which
these
conflicting
notes
should
become
a
chord
was
fixed
for
sunday
evening
next
up
to
now
he
had
had
evidence
of
her
presence
he
had
received
intelligible
messages
though
fragmentary
and
half
stammered
through
the
mysterious
veil
he
had
for
an
instant
or
two
looked
upon
her
face
but
the
real
point
he
hoped
would
come
in
two
days
the
public
had
not
impressed
him
he
had
been
to
three
or
four
of
these
in
a
certain
road
off
baker
street
and
had
been
astonished
and
disappointed
the
kind
of
people
that
he
had
met
there
sentimental
bourgeois
with
less
power
of
sifting
evidence
than
the
average
child
with
a
credulity
that
was
almost
supernatural
the
medium
a
stout
woman
who
rolled
her
eyes
and
had
damp
fat
fingers
the
the
wheezy
harmonium
the
amazing
oracular
messages
that
revealed
nothing
which
a
religiose
fool
could
not
invent
in
fact
the
whole
affair
from
the
sham
to
the
ghostly
tambourines
overhead
the
puerility
of
the
tricks
played
on
the
inquirers
and
all
the
rest
of
it
this
seemed
as
little
connected
with
what
he
had
experienced
with
vincent
as
a
dervish
dance
with
high
mass
he
had
reflected
with
almost
ludicrous
horror
upon
the
impression
it
would
make
on
maggie
and
the
remarks
it
would
elicit
but
this
other
engagement
was
a
very
different
matter
they
were
going
to
attempt
a
further
advance
it
had
indeed
been
explained
to
him
that
these
attempts
were
but
tentative
and
experimental
it
was
impossible
to
dictate
exactly
what
should
fall
but
the
object
on
sunday
night
was
to
go
a
step
further
and
to
bring
about
if
possible
the
materialization
process
to
such
a
point
that
the
figure
could
be
handled
and
could
speak
and
it
seemed
to
laurie
as
if
this
would
be
final
indeed
so
he
sat
this
evening
within
hours
of
the
crisis
thinking
steadily
half
a
dozen
times
perhaps
the
thought
of
maggie
recurred
to
him
but
he
was
learning
how
to
get
rid
of
that
then
he
took
up
the
note
and
opened
it
it
was
filled
with
four
pages
of
writing
he
turned
to
the
end
and
read
the
signature
then
he
turned
back
and
read
the
whole
letter
it
was
very
quiet
as
he
sat
there
thinking
over
what
he
had
read
the
noise
of
fleet
street
came
up
here
only
as
the
soothing
murmur
of
the
sea
upon
a
beach
and
he
himself
sat
motionless
the
firelight
falling
upwards
upon
his
young
face
his
eyes
and
his
curly
hair
about
him
stood
his
familiar
furniture
the
grand
piano
a
pool
of
glimmering
dark
wood
in
the
background
the
tall
curtained
windows
suggestive
of
shelter
and
warmth
and
protection
yet
if
he
had
but
known
it
he
was
making
an
enormous
choice
the
letter
was
from
the
man
he
had
met
at
midday
and
he
was
deciding
how
to
answer
it
he
was
soothed
and
quieted
by
his
loneliness
and
his
irritation
had
disappeared
he
regarded
the
letter
from
a
youthfully
philosophical
standpoint
pleased
with
his
moderation
as
the
work
of
a
fanatic
he
was
considering
only
whether
he
would
yield
for
politeness
sake
to
the
importunity
or
answer
shortly
and
decisively
it
seemed
to
him
remarkable
that
a
mature
and
experienced
man
could
write
such
a
letter
at
last
he
got
up
went
to
his
and
sat
down
still
he
hesitated
for
a
minute
then
he
dipped
his
pen
and
wrote
when
he
had
finished
and
directed
it
he
went
back
to
the
fire
he
had
an
hour
yet
in
which
to
think
and
think
before
he
need
dress
he
had
promised
to
dine
with
stapleton
at
seven
he
had
a
touch
of
headache
and
perhaps
might
sleep
it
off
i
lady
laura
crossed
the
road
by
knightsbridge
barracks
and
turned
again
homewards
through
the
park
it
was
one
of
those
days
that
occasionally
fall
in
late
february
which
almost
cheer
the
beholder
into
a
belief
that
spring
has
really
begun
overhead
the
sky
was
a
clear
pale
blue
flecked
with
clouds
gauzy
and
white
beneath
the
whole
earth
was
waking
drowsily
from
a
frost
so
slight
as
only
to
emphasize
the
essential
softness
of
the
day
that
followed
the
crocuses
were
alight
in
the
grass
and
an
indescribable
tint
lay
over
all
that
had
life
like
the
flush
in
the
face
of
an
awakening
child
but
these
days
are
too
good
to
last
and
lady
laura
who
had
looked
at
the
forecast
of
a
sunday
paper
had
determined
to
take
her
exercise
immediately
after
church
she
had
come
out
not
long
before
from
all
saints
she
had
listened
to
an
excellent
though
unexciting
sermon
and
some
extremely
beautiful
singing
and
even
now
saturated
with
that
atmosphere
and
with
the
soothing
physical
air
in
which
she
walked
her
anxieties
seemed
less
acute
there
were
enough
of
her
acquaintances
too
in
groups
here
and
there
she
had
to
bow
and
smile
sufficiently
often
to
prevent
these
anxieties
from
reasserting
themselves
too
forcibly
and
it
may
be
supposed
that
not
a
creature
who
observed
her
in
her
exceedingly
graceful
hat
and
mantle
with
her
fair
head
a
little
on
one
side
and
her
delicately
gleaming
in
the
sunlight
had
the
very
faintest
suspicion
that
she
had
any
anxieties
at
all
yet
she
felt
strangely
unwilling
even
to
go
home
the
men
were
to
set
about
clearing
the
while
she
was
at
church
and
somehow
the
thought
that
it
would
be
done
when
she
got
home
that
the
temple
would
so
to
speak
be
cleared
for
sacrifice
was
a
distasteful
one
she
did
not
quite
know
when
the
change
had
begun
in
fact
she
was
scarcely
yet
aware
that
there
was
a
change
at
all
upon
one
point
only
her
attention
fixed
itself
and
that
was
the
increasing
desire
she
felt
that
laurie
baxter
should
go
no
further
in
his
researches
under
her
auspices
up
to
within
a
few
weeks
ago
she
had
been
all
ardor
it
had
seemed
to
her
as
has
been
said
that
the
apparent
results
of
spiritualism
were
all
to
the
good
that
they
were
in
no
point
contrary
to
the
religion
she
happened
to
believe
in
fact
that
they
made
real
as
does
an
actual
tree
in
the
foreground
of
a
panorama
the
rather
misty
sky
and
hills
of
christianity
she
had
even
called
them
very
teaching
it
was
about
eighteen
months
since
she
had
first
taken
this
up
under
the
onslaught
of
stapleton
enthusiasm
but
things
had
not
been
as
satisfactory
as
she
wished
until
vincent
had
appeared
then
indeed
matters
had
moved
forward
she
had
seen
extraordinary
things
and
the
effect
of
them
had
been
doubled
by
the
medium
obvious
honesty
and
his
strong
personality
he
was
to
her
as
a
resolute
priest
to
a
timid
penitent
he
had
led
her
forward
supported
by
his
own
conviction
and
his
extremely
steady
will
until
she
had
begun
to
feel
at
home
in
this
amazing
new
world
and
eager
to
make
proselytes
then
laurie
had
appeared
and
almost
immediately
a
dread
had
seized
her
that
she
could
neither
explain
nor
understand
she
had
attempted
a
little
tentative
conversation
on
the
point
with
dearest
maud
but
dearest
maud
had
appeared
so
entirely
incapable
of
understanding
her
scruples
that
she
had
said
no
more
but
her
inexplicable
anxiety
had
already
reached
such
a
point
that
she
had
determined
to
say
a
word
to
laurie
on
the
subject
this
had
been
done
without
avail
and
now
a
new
step
forward
was
to
be
made
as
to
of
what
this
step
consisted
she
was
perfectly
aware
the
controls
she
believed
the
spirits
that
desired
to
communicate
had
a
series
of
graduated
steps
by
which
the
communications
could
be
made
from
mere
incoherent
noises
as
a
man
may
rap
a
message
from
one
room
to
another
through
appearances
also
incoherent
and
intangible
right
up
to
the
final
point
of
assuming
visible
tangible
form
and
of
speaking
in
an
audible
voice
this
process
she
believed
consisted
first
in
a
mere
connection
between
spirit
and
matter
and
finally
passed
into
an
actual
assumption
of
matter
molded
into
the
form
of
the
body
once
worn
by
the
spirit
on
earth
for
nearly
all
of
this
process
she
had
had
the
evidence
of
her
own
senses
she
had
received
messages
inexplicable
to
her
except
on
the
hypothesis
put
forward
from
departed
relations
of
her
own
she
had
seen
lights
and
faces
and
even
figures
formed
before
her
eyes
in
her
own
but
she
had
not
as
yet
though
dearest
maud
had
been
more
fortunate
been
able
to
handle
and
grasp
such
figures
to
satisfy
the
sense
of
touch
as
well
as
of
sight
in
proof
of
the
reality
of
the
phenomenon
yes
she
was
satisfied
even
with
what
she
had
seen
she
had
no
manner
of
doubt
as
to
the
theories
put
before
her
by
vincent
yet
she
shrank
and
she
scarcely
knew
why
from
that
final
consummation
which
it
was
proposed
to
carry
out
if
possible
that
evening
but
the
shrinking
centered
round
some
danger
to
laurie
baxter
rather
than
to
herself
it
was
these
kinds
of
thoughts
that
beset
her
as
she
walked
up
beneath
the
trees
on
her
way
homewards
checked
and
soothed
now
somewhat
by
the
pleasant
air
and
the
radiant
sunlight
yet
perceptible
beneath
everything
and
it
was
not
only
of
laurie
baxter
that
she
thought
she
spared
a
little
attention
for
herself
for
she
had
begun
to
be
aware
for
the
first
time
since
her
initiation
of
a
very
faint
distaste
as
slight
and
yet
as
suggestive
as
that
caused
by
a
consciousness
of
a
delicately
disagreeable
smell
there
comes
such
a
moment
in
the
life
of
cut
flowers
in
water
when
the
impetus
of
growing
energy
ceases
and
a
new
tone
makes
itself
felt
in
their
scent
of
which
the
end
is
certain
it
is
not
sufficient
to
cause
the
flowers
to
be
thrown
away
they
still
possess
volumes
of
fragrance
yet
these
decrease
and
the
new
scent
increases
until
it
has
the
victory
so
it
was
now
to
the
perceptions
of
this
lady
oh
yes
spiritualism
was
very
teaching
and
beautiful
it
was
perfectly
compatible
with
orthodox
religion
it
was
undeniably
true
she
would
not
dream
of
giving
it
up
only
it
would
be
better
if
laurie
baxter
did
not
meddle
with
it
he
was
too
sensitive
however
he
was
coming
that
evening
again
there
was
the
fact
as
she
turned
southwards
at
last
crossing
the
road
again
towards
her
own
street
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
day
even
now
was
beginning
to
cloud
over
over
the
roofs
of
kensington
a
haze
was
beginning
to
make
itself
visible
as
impalpable
as
a
skein
of
smoke
yet
there
it
was
she
felt
a
little
languid
too
perhaps
she
had
walked
too
far
she
would
rest
a
little
after
lunch
if
dearest
maud
did
not
mind
for
dearest
maud
was
to
lunch
with
her
as
was
usual
on
sundays
when
the
colonel
was
away
as
she
came
slower
than
ever
down
the
broad
opulent
pavement
of
queen
gate
through
the
silence
and
emptiness
of
sunday
for
the
church
bells
were
long
ago
silent
she
noticed
coming
towards
her
with
a
sauntering
step
an
old
gentleman
in
frock
coat
and
silk
hat
of
a
slightly
antique
appearance
spatted
and
gloved
carrying
his
hands
behind
his
back
as
if
he
were
waiting
to
be
joined
by
some
friend
from
one
of
the
houses
she
noticed
that
he
looked
at
her
through
his
glasses
but
thought
no
more
of
it
till
she
turned
up
the
steps
of
her
own
house
then
she
was
startled
by
the
sound
of
quick
footsteps
and
a
voice
i
beg
your
pardon
madam
she
turned
with
her
key
in
the
door
and
there
he
stood
hat
in
hand
have
i
the
pleasure
of
speaking
to
lady
laura
bethell
there
was
a
pleasant
brisk
ring
about
his
voice
that
inclined
her
rather
favorably
towards
him
is
there
anything
did
you
want
to
speak
to
me
yes
i
am
lady
laura
bethell
i
was
told
you
were
at
church
madam
and
that
you
were
not
at
home
to
visitors
on
sunday
that
is
quite
right
may
i
ask
only
a
few
minutes
lady
laura
i
promise
you
will
you
forgive
my
persistence
yes
the
man
was
a
gentleman
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
would
not
tomorrow
do
i
am
rather
engaged
today
he
had
his
ready
and
without
answering
her
at
once
he
came
up
the
steps
and
handed
it
to
her
the
name
meant
nothing
at
all
to
her
will
not
tomorrow
she
began
again
tomorrow
will
be
too
late
said
the
old
gentleman
i
beg
of
you
lady
laura
it
is
on
an
extremely
important
matter
she
still
hesitated
an
instant
then
she
pushed
the
door
open
and
went
in
please
come
in
she
said
she
was
so
taken
aback
by
the
sudden
situation
that
she
forgot
completely
that
the
would
be
upside
down
and
led
the
way
straight
upstairs
and
it
was
not
till
she
was
actually
within
the
door
with
the
old
gentleman
close
on
her
heels
that
she
saw
that
with
the
exception
of
three
or
four
chairs
about
the
fire
and
the
table
set
out
near
the
hearthrug
the
room
was
empty
of
furniture
i
forgot
she
said
but
will
you
mind
coming
in
here
we
we
have
a
meeting
here
this
evening
she
led
the
way
to
the
fire
and
at
first
did
not
notice
that
he
was
not
following
her
when
she
turned
round
she
saw
the
old
gentleman
with
his
air
of
antique
politeness
completely
vanished
standing
and
looking
about
him
with
a
very
peculiar
expression
she
also
noticed
to
her
annoyance
that
the
cabinet
was
already
in
place
in
the
little
and
that
his
eyes
almost
immediately
rested
upon
it
yet
there
was
no
look
of
wonder
in
his
face
rather
it
was
such
a
look
as
a
man
might
have
on
visiting
the
scene
of
a
crime
interest
knowledge
and
loathing
so
it
is
here
he
said
in
quite
a
low
voice
then
he
came
across
the
room
towards
her
ii
for
an
instant
his
bearded
face
looked
so
strangely
at
her
that
she
half
moved
towards
the
bell
then
he
smiled
with
a
little
reassuring
gesture
no
no
he
said
may
i
sit
down
a
moment
she
began
hastily
to
cover
her
confusion
it
is
a
meeting
she
said
for
this
evening
i
am
sorry
just
so
he
said
it
is
about
that
that
i
have
come
i
beg
your
pardon
please
sit
down
lady
laura
may
i
say
in
a
sentence
what
i
have
come
to
say
this
seemed
a
very
odd
old
man
why
yes
she
said
i
have
come
to
beg
you
not
to
allow
baxter
to
enter
the
house
no
i
have
no
authority
from
anyone
least
of
all
from
baxter
he
has
no
idea
that
i
have
come
he
would
think
it
an
unwarrantable
piece
of
impertinence
cathcart
i
i
can
not
allow
me
he
said
with
a
little
compelling
gesture
that
silenced
her
i
have
been
asked
to
interfere
by
a
couple
of
people
very
much
interested
in
baxter
one
of
them
if
not
both
completely
disbelieves
in
spiritualism
then
you
know
he
waved
his
hand
towards
the
cabinet
of
course
i
know
he
said
why
i
was
a
spiritualist
for
ten
years
myself
no
not
a
medium
not
a
professional
that
is
to
say
i
know
all
about
vincent
all
about
stapleton
and
yourself
lady
laura
i
still
follow
the
news
closely
i
know
perfectly
well
and
you
have
given
it
up
i
have
given
it
up
for
a
long
while
he
said
quietly
and
i
have
come
to
ask
you
to
forbid
baxter
to
be
present
this
evening
for
for
the
same
reason
for
which
i
have
given
it
up
myself
yes
and
that
i
do
think
we
need
go
into
that
he
said
it
is
enough
is
it
not
for
me
to
say
that
baxter
work
and
in
fact
his
whole
nervous
system
is
suffering
considerably
from
the
excitement
that
one
of
the
persons
who
have
asked
me
to
do
what
i
can
is
own
and
that
even
if
he
had
not
asked
me
baxter
own
appearance
you
know
him
practically
no
i
lunched
at
the
same
table
with
him
on
friday
the
symptoms
are
quite
unmistakable
i
do
understand
symptoms
well
we
will
say
symptoms
of
nervous
excitement
you
are
aware
no
doubt
that
he
is
exceptionally
sensitive
probably
you
have
seen
for
yourself
wait
a
moment
said
lady
laura
her
own
heart
beating
furiously
why
do
you
not
go
to
baxter
himself
i
have
done
so
i
arranged
to
meet
him
at
lunch
and
somehow
i
took
a
wrong
turn
with
him
i
have
no
tact
whatever
as
you
perceive
but
i
wrote
to
him
on
friday
night
offering
to
call
upon
him
and
just
giving
him
a
hint
well
it
was
useless
he
refused
to
see
me
i
do
see
what
i
oh
yes
chirped
the
old
gentleman
almost
gaily
it
would
be
quite
unusual
and
unconventional
i
just
ask
you
to
send
him
a
line
i
will
take
it
myself
if
you
wish
it
telling
him
that
you
think
it
would
be
better
for
him
not
to
come
and
saying
that
you
are
making
other
arrangements
for
tonight
he
looked
at
her
with
that
odd
little
air
of
birdlike
briskness
that
she
had
noticed
in
the
street
and
it
pleasantly
affected
her
even
in
the
midst
of
the
uneasiness
that
now
surged
upon
her
again
tenfold
more
than
before
she
could
see
that
there
was
something
else
behind
his
manner
it
had
just
looked
out
in
the
glance
he
had
given
round
the
room
on
entering
but
she
could
not
trouble
at
this
moment
to
analyze
what
it
was
she
was
completely
bewildered
by
the
strangeness
of
the
encounter
and
the
extraordinary
coincidence
of
this
judgment
with
her
own
yet
there
were
a
hundred
reasons
against
her
taking
his
advice
what
would
the
others
say
what
of
all
the
arrangements
the
expectation
i
do
see
how
it
possible
now
she
began
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean
but
indeed
i
trust
you
have
no
idea
cried
the
old
gentleman
with
a
queer
little
falsetto
note
coming
into
his
voice
no
idea
at
all
i
come
to
you
merely
on
the
plea
of
nervous
excitement
it
is
injuring
his
health
lady
laura
she
looked
at
him
curiously
but
she
began
oh
i
will
go
further
he
said
have
you
never
heard
of
of
insanity
in
connection
with
all
this
we
will
call
it
insanity
if
you
wish
for
a
moment
her
heart
stood
still
the
word
had
a
sinister
sound
in
view
of
an
incident
she
had
once
witnessed
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
some
meaning
behind
unknown
to
her
was
still
more
sinister
why
had
he
said
that
it
might
be
called
insanity
only
yes
i
i
have
once
seen
a
case
she
stammered
well
said
the
old
gentleman
is
it
not
enough
when
i
tell
you
that
i
i
who
was
a
spiritualist
for
ten
years
have
never
seen
a
more
dangerous
subject
than
baxter
is
the
risk
worth
it
lady
laura
do
you
quite
understand
what
you
are
doing
he
leaned
forward
a
little
and
again
she
felt
anxiety
sickening
and
horrible
surge
within
her
yet
on
the
other
hand
the
door
opened
suddenly
and
vincent
came
in
iii
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
then
the
old
gentleman
turned
round
and
in
an
instant
was
on
his
feet
quiet
but
with
an
air
of
bristling
about
his
chin
and
his
tense
attitude
vincent
paused
looking
from
one
to
the
other
i
beg
your
pardon
lady
laura
he
said
courteously
your
man
told
me
to
wait
here
i
think
he
did
not
know
you
had
come
in
well
er
this
gentleman
began
lady
laura
why
do
you
know
mr
vincent
she
asked
suddenly
startled
by
the
expression
in
the
old
gentleman
face
i
used
to
know
vincent
he
said
shortly
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
smiled
the
medium
coming
forward
to
the
fire
my
name
is
cathcart
sir
the
other
started
almost
imperceptibly
ah
yes
he
said
quietly
we
did
meet
a
few
times
i
remember
lady
laura
was
conscious
of
distinct
relief
at
the
interruption
it
seemed
to
her
a
providential
escape
from
a
troublesome
decision
i
think
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
cathcart
no
go
vincent
we
had
finished
our
talk
lady
laura
said
the
old
gentleman
with
a
rather
determined
air
i
beg
of
you
to
give
me
ten
minutes
more
private
conversation
she
hesitated
clearly
foreseeing
trouble
either
way
then
she
decided
there
is
no
necessity
today
she
said
if
you
care
to
make
an
appointment
for
one
day
next
week
cathcart
i
am
to
understand
that
you
refuse
me
a
few
minutes
now
there
is
no
necessity
that
i
can
see
then
i
must
say
what
i
have
to
say
before
vincent
one
moment
sir
put
in
the
medium
with
that
sudden
slight
air
of
imperiousness
that
lady
laura
knew
very
well
by
now
if
lady
laura
consents
to
hear
you
i
must
take
it
on
myself
to
see
that
nothing
offensive
is
said
he
glanced
as
if
for
leave
towards
the
woman
she
made
an
effort
if
you
will
say
it
quickly
she
began
otherwise
the
old
gentleman
drew
a
breath
as
if
to
steady
himself
it
was
plain
that
he
was
very
strongly
moved
beneath
his
his
air
of
cheerful
geniality
was
gone
i
will
say
it
in
one
sentence
he
said
it
is
this
you
are
ruining
that
boy
between
you
body
and
soul
and
you
are
responsible
before
his
maker
and
yours
and
if
lady
laura
said
the
medium
do
you
wish
to
hear
any
more
she
made
a
doubtful
little
gesture
of
assent
and
if
you
wish
to
know
my
reasons
for
saying
this
went
on
cathcart
you
have
only
to
ask
for
them
from
vincent
he
knows
well
enough
why
i
left
spiritualism
if
he
dares
to
tell
you
lady
laura
glanced
at
the
medium
he
was
perfectly
still
and
quiet
looking
watching
the
old
man
curiously
and
half
humorously
under
his
heavy
eyebrows
and
i
understand
went
on
the
other
that
tonight
you
are
to
make
an
attempt
at
complete
materialization
very
good
then
after
tonight
it
may
be
too
late
i
have
tried
to
appeal
to
the
boy
he
will
not
hear
me
and
you
too
have
refused
to
hear
me
out
i
could
give
you
evidence
if
you
wished
ask
this
gentleman
how
many
cases
he
has
known
in
the
last
five
years
where
complete
ruin
body
and
soul
the
medium
turned
a
little
to
the
fire
sighing
as
if
for
weariness
and
at
the
sound
the
old
man
stopped
trembling
it
was
more
obvious
than
ever
that
he
only
held
himself
in
restraint
by
a
very
violent
effort
it
was
as
if
the
presence
of
the
medium
affected
him
in
an
extraordinary
degree
lady
laura
glanced
again
from
one
to
the
other
that
is
all
then
she
said
his
lips
worked
then
he
burst
out
i
am
sick
of
talking
he
cried
sick
of
it
i
have
warned
you
that
is
enough
i
can
not
do
more
he
wheeled
on
his
heel
and
went
out
a
minute
later
the
two
heard
the
front
door
bang
she
looked
at
vincent
he
was
twirling
softly
in
his
strong
fingers
a
little
bronze
candlestick
that
stood
on
the
mantelpiece
his
manner
was
completely
unconcerned
he
even
seemed
to
be
smiling
a
little
for
herself
she
felt
helpless
she
had
taken
her
choice
impelled
to
it
though
she
scarcely
recognized
the
fact
by
the
entrance
of
this
strong
personality
and
now
she
needed
reassurance
once
again
but
before
she
had
a
word
to
say
he
spoke
still
in
his
serene
manner
yes
yes
he
said
i
remember
now
i
used
to
know
cathcart
once
a
very
violent
old
gentleman
what
did
he
mean
his
reasons
for
leaving
us
indeed
i
scarcely
remember
i
suppose
it
was
because
he
became
a
catholic
was
there
nothing
more
he
looked
at
her
pleasantly
why
i
daresay
there
was
i
really
ca
remember
lady
laura
i
suppose
he
had
his
nerves
shaken
you
can
see
for
yourself
what
a
fanatic
he
is
but
in
spite
of
his
presence
once
more
a
gust
of
anxiety
shook
her
vincent
are
you
sure
it
safe
for
baxter
i
mean
safe
why
he
as
safe
as
any
of
us
can
be
we
all
have
nervous
systems
of
course
but
he
particularly
sensitive
is
he
indeed
yes
that
is
why
even
this
evening
he
must
not
go
into
trance
that
must
come
later
after
a
good
training
she
stood
up
and
came
herself
to
stand
by
the
mantelpiece
then
really
there
no
danger
he
turned
straight
to
her
looking
at
her
with
kind
smiling
eyes
lady
laura
he
said
have
i
ever
yet
told
you
that
there
was
no
danger
i
think
not
there
is
always
danger
for
every
one
of
us
as
there
is
for
the
scientist
in
the
laboratory
and
the
engineer
in
his
machinery
but
what
we
can
do
is
to
reduce
that
danger
to
a
minimum
so
that
humanly
speaking
we
are
reasonably
and
sufficiently
safe
no
doubt
you
remember
the
case
of
that
girl
well
that
was
an
accident
and
accidents
will
happen
but
do
me
the
justice
to
remember
that
it
was
the
first
time
that
i
had
seen
her
it
was
absolutely
impossible
to
foresee
she
was
on
the
very
edge
of
a
nervous
breakdown
before
she
entered
the
room
but
with
regard
to
baxter
i
have
seen
him
again
and
again
and
i
tell
you
that
i
consider
him
to
be
running
a
certain
risk
but
a
perfectly
justifiable
one
and
one
that
is
reduced
to
a
minimum
if
i
did
not
think
that
we
were
taking
every
precaution
i
would
not
have
him
in
the
room
for
all
the
world
are
you
satisfied
lady
laura
every
word
he
said
helped
her
back
to
assurance
it
was
all
so
reasonable
and
well
weighed
if
he
had
said
there
was
no
danger
she
would
have
feared
the
more
but
his
very
recognition
of
it
gave
her
security
and
above
all
his
tranquility
and
his
strength
were
enormous
assets
on
his
side
she
drew
a
breath
and
decided
to
go
forward
and
mr
cathcart
she
asked
he
smiled
again
you
can
see
what
he
is
he
said
i
should
advise
you
not
to
see
him
again
it
of
no
sort
of
use
i
the
weather
forecasts
had
been
in
the
right
and
the
few
that
struggled
homewards
that
night
from
church
fought
against
a
wind
that
tore
laden
with
driving
rain
up
the
streets
and
across
the
open
spaces
till
the
very
lights
were
dimmed
in
the
tall
street
lamps
and
shone
only
through
streaming
panes
that
seemed
half
opaque
with
mist
and
vapor
in
queen
gate
hardly
one
lighted
window
showed
that
the
houses
were
inhabited
so
fierce
was
the
clamor
and
storm
of
the
broad
street
that
men
made
haste
to
shut
out
every
glimpse
of
the
night
and
the
fanlights
above
the
doors
or
here
and
there
a
line
of
brightness
where
some
draught
had
tossed
the
curtains
apart
were
the
only
signs
of
human
life
outside
the
broad
pavements
stared
like
surfaces
of
some
canal
black
and
empty
of
passengers
catching
every
spark
or
hint
of
light
from
house
and
lamp
transforming
it
to
a
tall
streak
of
glimmering
wetness
the
housekeeper
room
in
this
house
on
the
right
was
the
more
delightful
from
the
contrast
it
was
here
that
the
august
assembly
was
held
every
evening
after
supper
set
about
with
rigid
etiquette
and
ancient
rite
its
windows
looked
on
to
the
little
square
garden
at
the
back
but
were
now
tight
shuttered
and
curtained
and
the
room
was
a
very
model
of
comfort
and
warmth
before
the
fire
a
square
table
was
drawn
up
set
out
with
pudding
and
fruit
for
it
was
here
that
the
upper
servants
withdrew
after
the
cold
meat
and
beer
of
the
hall
to
be
waited
upon
by
the
butler
boy
and
it
was
round
this
that
the
four
sat
in
state
housekeeper
butler
lady
maid
and
cook
it
was
already
after
ten
and
parker
was
permitted
to
smoke
a
small
cigar
they
had
discussed
the
weather
the
sermon
that
miss
baker
had
heard
in
the
morning
and
the
prospects
of
a
dissolution
and
they
had
once
more
returned
to
the
mysteries
that
were
being
enacted
upstairs
they
were
getting
accustomed
to
them
now
and
there
was
not
a
great
deal
to
say
unless
they
repeated
themselves
which
they
had
no
objection
to
do
their
attitude
was
one
of
tolerant
skepticism
tempered
by
an
agreeable
tendency
on
the
part
of
miss
baker
to
become
agitated
after
a
certain
point
vincent
it
was
generally
conceded
was
a
respectable
sort
of
man
with
an
air
about
him
that
could
hardly
be
put
into
words
and
it
was
thought
to
be
a
pity
that
he
lent
himself
to
such
superstition
stapleton
had
been
long
ago
dismissed
as
a
silly
sort
of
woman
though
with
a
will
of
her
own
and
her
ladyship
of
course
must
have
her
way
it
could
not
last
long
it
was
thought
but
young
baxter
was
another
matter
and
there
was
a
deal
to
say
about
him
he
was
a
gentleman
that
was
certain
and
he
seemed
to
have
sense
but
it
was
a
pity
that
he
was
so
often
here
now
on
this
business
he
had
not
said
one
word
to
parker
this
evening
as
he
took
off
his
coat
parker
had
not
thought
that
he
looked
very
well
he
was
too
said
the
butler
as
to
the
details
of
the
affair
upstairs
these
were
considered
in
a
purely
humorous
light
it
was
understood
that
tables
danced
a
hornpipe
and
that
tambourines
were
beaten
by
invisible
hands
and
it
was
not
necessary
to
go
further
into
principles
particularly
since
all
these
things
were
done
by
machinery
at
the
egyptian
hall
faces
also
it
was
believed
were
seen
looking
out
of
the
cabinet
which
parker
had
once
more
helped
to
erect
this
morning
but
these
it
was
explained
were
done
by
luminous
paint
finally
if
people
insisted
on
looking
into
causes
electricity
was
a
sufficient
answer
for
all
the
rest
no
one
actually
suggested
as
for
human
motives
these
were
not
called
in
question
at
all
it
appeared
to
amuse
some
people
to
do
this
kind
of
thing
as
others
might
collect
old
china
or
practice
the
cotillion
there
it
was
a
fact
and
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
about
it
old
lady
carraden
where
parker
had
once
been
had
gone
in
for
pouter
pigeons
and
miss
baker
had
heard
tell
of
a
nobleman
who
had
a
carpenter
shop
of
his
own
these
things
were
so
then
and
meantime
here
was
a
cigar
to
be
smoked
by
parker
and
a
little
weak
tea
to
be
taken
by
the
three
ladies
it
was
about
a
ten
when
a
reversion
was
made
to
the
weather
within
here
all
was
supremely
comfortable
a
black
stuff
mat
with
a
red
fringed
border
lay
before
the
blazing
fire
convenient
to
the
feet
the
heavy
red
curtains
shut
out
the
darkness
and
where
the
glass
cases
of
china
permitted
it
large
photographs
of
wedding
groups
and
the
houses
of
the
nobility
hung
upon
the
walls
a
king
spaniel
in
another
glass
case
looked
upon
the
company
with
an
eternal
snarl
belied
by
the
mildness
of
his
brown
eyes
and
corresponding
to
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
a
numerous
family
of
a
little
dusty
and
dim
poised
perpetually
above
the
flowers
of
a
lichened
tree
with
a
flaming
sunset
to
show
them
up
but
without
the
wind
tore
unceasingly
laden
with
rain
through
the
gusty
darkness
of
the
little
garden
and
in
the
pauses
the
swift
dripping
from
the
roof
splashed
and
splashed
upon
the
paved
walk
it
was
a
very
wild
night
as
parker
observed
four
times
he
only
hoped
that
no
one
would
require
a
hansom
cab
he
had
been
foolish
enough
to
take
the
responsibility
tonight
of
letting
the
guests
out
himself
and
of
allowing
william
to
go
to
bed
when
he
wished
and
these
were
late
affairs
seldom
over
before
eleven
and
often
not
till
nearly
midnight
martin
in
her
blouse
moved
a
little
nearer
the
fire
and
said
she
must
be
off
soon
to
bed
mayle
in
her
black
silk
added
that
there
was
no
telling
when
her
ladyship
would
get
to
bed
what
with
stapleton
and
all
and
commiserated
miss
baker
miss
baker
moaned
a
little
in
and
parker
remarked
for
the
fifth
time
that
it
was
a
wild
night
it
was
an
astonishingly
serene
and
domestic
atmosphere
no
effort
of
imagination
or
wit
was
required
from
anybody
it
was
enough
to
make
observations
when
they
occurred
to
the
brain
and
they
would
meet
with
a
tranquil
response
as
ten
tinkled
out
from
the
little
yellow
marble
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
it
had
been
won
by
mayle
deceased
husband
in
a
horticultural
exhibition
martin
said
that
she
must
go
and
have
a
look
at
the
scullery
to
see
that
all
was
as
it
should
be
there
was
no
knowing
with
these
girls
nowadays
what
they
might
not
leave
undone
and
mayle
preened
herself
gently
with
the
thought
that
her
responsibilities
were
on
a
higher
plane
parker
made
a
courteous
movement
as
if
to
rise
and
remained
seated
as
the
cook
rustled
out
miss
baker
sighed
again
as
she
contemplated
the
long
conversation
that
might
take
place
between
the
two
ladies
upstairs
before
she
could
get
her
mistress
to
bed
once
more
the
tranquil
atmosphere
settled
down
on
the
warm
room
the
brass
lamp
burned
brightly
with
a
faint
and
reassuring
smell
of
paraffin
the
fire
presented
a
radiant
cavern
of
red
coals
fringed
by
dancing
flames
and
parker
leaned
forwards
to
shake
off
the
ash
of
his
cigar
then
on
a
sudden
he
paused
for
from
the
passage
outside
came
the
passionless
tinkle
of
an
electric
bell
then
another
and
another
and
another
as
if
some
person
overhead
strove
by
reiteration
on
that
single
note
to
cry
out
some
overwhelming
need
ii
overhead
in
the
great
empty
the
noise
of
the
wind
and
rain
the
almost
continuous
spatter
on
the
glass
and
the
long
hooting
of
the
gusts
had
been
far
more
noticeable
than
in
the
basement
beneath
below
stairs
the
company
had
been
natural
and
normal
talking
of
this
and
that
in
a
brightly
lighted
room
dwelling
only
on
matters
that
fell
beneath
the
range
of
their
senses
lulled
by
warmth
and
food
and
into
a
kind
of
rapt
but
up
here
in
the
gloom
lighted
only
on
this
occasion
by
a
single
shaded
candle
in
a
complete
interior
silence
three
persons
had
sat
round
a
table
for
more
than
an
hour
striving
by
passivity
and
a
kind
of
indescribable
concentration
to
ignore
all
that
was
presented
by
the
senses
and
to
await
some
movement
from
that
which
lies
beyond
them
lady
laura
had
sat
down
that
night
in
a
state
of
mind
which
she
could
not
analyze
it
was
not
that
her
anxieties
had
been
lulled
so
much
as
counterbalanced
they
were
still
there
at
once
poignant
and
heavy
but
on
the
other
side
there
had
been
the
assured
air
of
the
medium
his
reasonableness
and
his
personality
as
well
as
the
enthusiasm
of
her
friend
and
her
astonished
remonstrances
she
had
decided
to
acquiesce
not
because
she
was
satisfied
but
because
on
the
whole
anxiety
was
outweighed
by
confidence
she
could
not
have
taken
action
under
such
circumstances
but
she
could
at
least
refrain
from
it
laurie
as
parker
had
noticed
had
been
he
had
said
very
little
indeed
but
a
nervous
strain
was
evident
in
the
brightness
of
his
eyes
but
in
answer
to
a
conventional
inquiry
he
had
declared
himself
extremely
well
vincent
had
looked
at
him
for
just
an
instant
longer
than
usual
as
he
shook
hands
but
he
said
nothing
stapleton
had
made
an
ecstatic
remark
or
two
on
the
envy
with
which
she
regarded
the
boy
sensitive
faculties
at
the
beginning
of
the
the
medium
had
repeated
his
warnings
as
to
laurie
avoiding
of
trance
and
had
added
one
or
two
other
precautions
then
he
had
gone
into
the
cabinet
the
fire
had
been
pressed
down
under
ashes
and
a
single
candle
lighted
and
placed
behind
the
angle
of
the
little
adjoining
room
in
such
a
position
that
its
shaded
light
fell
upon
the
cabinet
only
and
the
figure
of
the
medium
within
when
the
silence
became
fixed
lady
laura
for
the
first
time
perceived
the
rage
of
wind
and
rain
outside
the
very
intensity
of
the
interior
stillness
and
the
rapture
of
attention
emphasized
to
an
extraordinary
degree
the
windy
roar
without
yet
the
silence
seemed
to
her
now
as
always
to
have
a
peculiar
faculty
of
detaching
the
psychical
from
the
physical
atmosphere
in
spite
of
the
batter
of
rain
not
ten
feet
away
the
sighing
between
the
shutters
and
even
the
lift
now
and
again
of
the
heavy
curtains
in
the
draught
she
seemed
to
herself
as
remote
from
it
as
does
a
man
crouching
in
the
dark
under
some
ruin
feel
himself
at
an
almost
infinite
distance
from
the
pick
and
the
hammer
of
the
rescuers
these
were
in
one
world
she
in
another
for
over
an
hour
no
movement
was
made
she
herself
sat
facing
the
fire
laurie
on
her
left
looking
towards
the
cabinet
with
his
back
to
the
windows
stapleton
opposite
to
her
an
endless
procession
of
thoughts
defiled
before
her
as
she
sat
yet
these
too
were
somewhat
remote
far
up
so
to
speak
on
the
superficies
of
consciousness
they
did
not
approach
that
realm
of
the
will
poised
now
and
attentive
on
another
range
of
existence
once
and
again
she
glanced
up
without
moving
her
head
at
the
profile
on
her
left
at
the
somewhat
outline
opposite
to
her
then
down
again
at
the
polished
little
round
table
and
the
six
hands
laid
upon
it
and
meanwhile
her
brain
revolved
images
rather
than
thoughts
memories
rather
than
reflections
vignettes
so
to
speak
old
cathcart
in
his
spats
and
the
look
on
the
medium
face
there
and
gone
again
in
an
instant
as
he
had
heard
the
stranger
name
the
carved
oak
stalls
of
the
chancel
towards
which
she
had
faced
this
morning
the
look
of
the
park
the
bloom
upon
the
still
leafless
trees
the
radiance
of
the
blue
spring
sky
it
must
have
been
she
thought
after
a
little
over
an
hour
that
the
first
expected
movement
made
itself
felt
a
long
trembling
shudder
through
the
wood
beneath
her
hands
followed
by
a
strange
sensation
of
lightness
as
if
the
whole
table
rose
a
little
from
the
floor
then
almost
before
the
movement
subsided
a
torrent
of
little
taps
poured
itself
out
as
delicate
and
as
swift
and
it
seemed
as
perfectly
calculated
as
the
rapping
of
some
minute
electric
hammer
this
was
new
to
her
yet
not
so
unlike
other
experiences
as
to
seem
strange
or
perturbing
in
any
way
again
she
bent
her
attention
to
the
table
as
the
vibration
ceased
there
followed
a
long
silence
it
must
have
been
about
ten
minutes
later
that
she
became
aware
of
the
next
phenomenon
and
her
attention
had
been
called
to
it
by
a
sudden
noiseless
uplifting
of
the
profile
on
her
left
she
turned
her
face
to
the
cabinet
and
looked
and
there
perfectly
discernible
was
some
movement
going
on
between
the
curtains
for
the
moment
she
could
see
the
medium
clearly
his
arms
folded
indicated
by
the
white
lines
of
his
cuffs
across
his
breast
his
head
sunk
forward
in
deep
sleep
and
at
the
next
instant
the
curtains
flapped
two
or
three
times
as
if
jerked
from
within
and
finally
rested
completely
closed
she
glanced
quickly
at
the
boy
on
her
left
and
in
the
diffused
light
from
the
other
room
could
see
him
distinctly
his
eyes
open
and
watching
his
lips
compressed
as
if
in
some
tense
effort
of
when
she
looked
at
the
cabinet
again
she
could
see
that
some
movement
had
begun
again
behind
the
curtains
for
these
swayed
and
jerked
convulsively
as
if
some
person
with
but
little
room
was
moving
there
and
she
could
hear
now
as
the
gusts
outside
lulled
for
a
moment
the
steady
rather
stertorous
breathing
of
the
medium
then
once
again
the
wind
gathered
strength
outside
the
rain
tore
at
the
glass
like
a
streaming
handful
of
tiny
pebbles
and
the
great
curtains
at
her
side
lifted
and
sighed
in
the
draught
through
the
shutters
when
it
quieted
again
the
breathing
had
become
a
measured
moaning
as
that
which
a
dreaming
dog
emits
at
the
end
of
each
expiration
and
she
herself
drew
a
long
trembling
breath
overwhelmed
by
the
sense
of
some
struggle
in
the
room
such
as
she
had
not
experienced
before
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
express
this
even
to
herself
yet
the
perception
was
clear
as
clear
as
some
presentment
of
the
senses
she
knew
during
those
moments
as
she
watched
the
swaying
curtains
of
the
cabinet
in
the
shaded
light
that
fell
upon
them
and
heard
now
and
again
that
low
moan
from
behind
them
that
some
kind
of
stress
lay
upon
something
that
was
new
to
her
in
this
connection
for
the
time
she
forgot
her
undertone
of
anxiety
as
to
this
boy
at
her
side
and
a
curious
terrified
excitement
took
its
place
once
even
then
she
glanced
at
him
again
and
saw
the
motionless
profile
watching
always
watching
then
in
an
instant
the
climax
came
and
this
is
what
she
saw
the
commotion
of
the
curtains
ceased
suddenly
and
they
hung
in
straight
folds
from
roof
to
floor
of
the
little
cabinet
then
they
gently
parted
she
saw
the
long
fingers
that
laid
hold
of
them
and
the
form
of
a
person
came
out
descended
the
single
step
and
stood
on
the
floor
before
her
eyes
in
the
plain
candlelight
not
four
steps
away
it
was
the
figure
of
a
young
girl
perfectly
formed
in
all
its
parts
swathed
in
some
light
stuff
resembling
muslin
that
fell
almost
to
the
feet
and
shrouded
the
upper
part
of
the
head
her
hands
were
clasped
across
her
breast
her
bare
feet
were
visible
against
the
dark
floor
and
her
features
were
unmistakably
clear
there
was
a
certain
beauty
in
the
face
in
the
young
lips
the
open
eyes
and
the
dark
lines
of
the
brows
over
them
and
the
complexion
was
waxen
clear
as
of
a
blonde
but
as
the
observer
had
noticed
before
on
the
three
or
four
occasions
on
which
she
had
seen
these
phenomena
there
was
a
strange
set
of
the
features
as
if
the
life
that
lay
behind
them
had
not
perfectly
saturated
that
which
expressed
it
it
was
something
utterly
different
from
the
face
of
a
dead
person
yet
also
not
completely
alive
though
the
eyes
turned
a
little
in
their
sockets
and
the
young
lips
smiled
behind
her
plain
between
the
curtains
was
the
figure
of
the
medium
sunk
in
sleep
and
so
for
a
few
seconds
the
apparition
remained
it
seemed
to
the
watcher
that
during
those
seconds
the
whole
world
was
still
whether
in
truth
the
wind
had
dropped
or
whether
the
absorbed
attention
perceived
nothing
but
the
marvel
before
it
yet
so
it
seemed
even
the
breathing
of
the
medium
had
stopped
lady
laura
heard
only
the
ticking
of
the
watch
upon
her
own
wrist
then
as
once
more
a
gust
tore
up
from
the
the
figure
moved
forward
a
step
nearer
the
table
coming
with
a
motion
as
of
a
living
person
causing
it
even
appeared
that
faint
vibration
on
the
floor
as
of
a
living
body
she
stood
so
near
now
though
with
her
back
to
the
diffused
light
of
the
that
her
features
were
more
plain
than
before
the
stained
lips
the
open
eyes
the
shadow
beneath
the
nostrils
and
chin
even
the
white
fingers
clasped
across
the
breast
there
was
none
of
that
vague
mistiness
that
had
been
seen
once
before
in
that
room
every
line
was
as
as
in
the
face
of
a
living
person
even
the
swell
of
the
breast
beneath
the
hands
the
slender
sloping
shoulders
the
long
curved
line
from
hip
to
ankle
all
were
real
and
discernible
and
once
again
the
staring
eyes
of
the
watcher
took
in
and
her
mind
perceived
that
slight
look
on
the
pretty
appealing
face
once
again
the
figure
came
forward
straight
on
to
the
table
and
then
so
swift
that
not
a
motion
or
a
word
could
check
it
the
catastrophe
fell
there
was
a
violent
movement
on
lady
laura
left
hand
a
chair
shot
back
and
fell
and
with
a
horrible
tearing
cry
from
the
throat
the
boy
dashed
himself
face
forwards
across
the
table
snatched
at
and
for
an
instant
seized
something
real
and
concrete
that
stood
there
and
as
the
two
women
sprang
up
losing
sight
for
an
instant
of
the
figure
that
had
been
there
a
moment
ago
the
boy
sank
forward
moaning
and
sobbing
and
a
crash
as
of
a
heavy
body
falling
sounded
from
the
cabinet
for
a
space
of
reckonable
time
there
was
complete
silence
then
once
more
a
blast
of
wind
tore
up
from
the
rain
shattered
against
the
window
and
the
house
vibrated
to
the
shock
i
as
the
date
approached
maggie
felt
her
anxieties
settle
down
like
a
fire
from
turbulence
to
steady
flame
on
the
sunday
she
had
with
real
difficulty
kept
it
to
herself
and
the
fringe
of
the
storm
of
wind
and
rain
that
broke
over
herefordshire
in
the
evening
had
not
been
reassuring
yet
on
one
thing
her
will
kept
steady
hold
and
that
was
that
baxter
must
not
be
consulted
no
conceivable
good
could
result
and
there
might
even
be
harm
either
the
old
lady
would
be
too
much
or
not
enough
concerned
she
might
insist
on
laurie
return
to
stantons
or
might
write
him
a
cheering
letter
encouraging
him
to
amuse
himself
in
any
direction
that
he
pleased
so
maggie
passed
the
evening
in
fits
of
alternate
silence
and
small
conversation
and
succeeded
in
making
baxter
recommend
a
good
long
night
monday
morning
however
broke
with
a
cloudless
sky
an
air
like
wine
and
the
chatter
of
birds
and
by
the
time
that
maggie
went
to
look
at
the
crocuses
immediately
before
breakfast
she
was
all
but
at
her
ease
again
enough
however
of
anxiety
remained
to
make
her
hurry
out
to
the
when
she
heard
the
postman
on
his
way
to
the
back
door
there
was
one
letter
for
her
in
cathcart
handwriting
and
she
opened
it
rather
hastily
as
she
turned
in
again
to
the
garden
it
was
reassuring
it
stated
that
the
writer
had
approached
that
was
the
word
baxter
though
unfortunately
with
and
that
he
proposed
on
the
following
day
the
letter
was
dated
on
saturday
evening
also
to
approach
lady
laura
bethell
he
felt
fairly
confident
he
said
that
his
efforts
would
succeed
in
postponing
at
any
rate
baxter
visit
to
lady
laura
and
in
that
case
he
would
write
further
as
to
what
was
best
to
be
done
in
the
meanwhile
miss
deronnais
was
not
to
be
in
the
least
anxious
whatever
happened
it
was
extremely
improbable
that
one
visit
more
or
less
to
a
would
carry
any
great
harm
it
was
the
habit
rather
than
the
act
that
was
usually
harmful
to
the
nervous
system
and
the
writer
begged
to
remain
her
obedient
servant
maggie
spirits
rose
with
a
bound
how
extraordinarily
foolish
she
had
been
she
told
herself
to
have
been
filled
with
such
forebodings
last
night
it
was
more
than
likely
that
the
had
taken
place
without
laurie
and
even
at
the
worst
as
cathcart
said
he
was
probably
only
a
little
more
excited
than
usual
this
morning
so
she
began
to
think
about
future
arrangements
and
by
the
time
that
baxter
looked
benignantly
out
at
her
from
beneath
the
queen
anne
doorway
to
tell
her
that
breakfast
was
waiting
she
was
conceiving
of
the
possibility
of
going
up
herself
to
london
in
a
week
or
two
on
some
shopping
excuse
and
of
making
one
more
genial
attempt
to
persuade
laurie
to
be
a
sensible
boy
again
during
her
visit
to
the
after
breakfast
she
began
to
elaborate
these
plans
she
was
clear
now
once
again
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
fantastic
delusion
and
that
its
sole
harm
was
that
it
was
superstitious
and
she
threw
a
large
handful
of
maize
with
a
meditative
eye
it
was
on
that
ground
and
that
only
that
she
would
approach
laurie
perhaps
even
it
would
be
better
for
her
not
to
go
and
see
him
it
might
appear
that
she
was
making
too
much
of
it
a
good
sensible
letter
might
do
the
work
equally
well
well
she
would
wait
at
least
to
hear
from
cathcart
once
more
the
second
post
would
probably
bring
a
letter
from
him
she
emptied
her
bowl
she
was
out
again
in
the
spring
sunshine
walking
up
and
down
before
the
house
with
a
book
by
the
time
that
the
second
post
was
due
but
this
time
through
the
iron
gate
she
saw
the
postman
go
past
the
house
without
stopping
once
more
her
spirits
rose
this
time
one
might
say
to
par
and
she
went
indoors
her
window
looked
out
on
to
the
front
and
she
moved
her
to
it
to
catch
as
much
as
possible
of
the
radiant
air
and
light
of
the
spring
day
she
proposed
to
begin
to
sketch
out
what
she
would
say
to
laurie
and
suggest
if
he
wished
it
to
come
up
and
see
him
in
a
week
or
two
she
would
apologize
for
her
fussiness
and
say
that
the
reason
why
she
was
writing
was
that
she
did
not
want
his
mother
to
be
made
anxious
my
dear
laurie
she
bit
her
pen
gently
and
looked
out
of
the
window
to
catch
inspiration
for
the
particular
frame
of
words
with
which
she
should
begin
and
as
she
looked
an
old
gentleman
suddenly
appeared
beyond
the
iron
gate
shook
it
gently
glanced
up
in
vain
for
a
name
on
the
stone
posts
and
stood
irresolute
it
was
an
old
trap
that
of
the
front
gate
there
was
no
bell
and
it
was
necessary
for
visitors
to
come
straight
in
to
the
front
door
then
so
swiftly
that
she
could
not
formulate
it
an
anxiety
leapt
at
her
and
she
laid
her
pen
down
staring
who
was
this
she
went
quickly
to
the
bell
and
rang
it
standing
there
waiting
with
beating
heart
and
face
suddenly
gone
white
susan
she
said
there
is
an
old
gentleman
at
the
gate
go
out
and
see
who
it
is
stop
if
it
is
anyone
for
me
if
if
he
gives
the
name
of
cathcart
ask
him
to
be
so
kind
as
to
go
round
the
turn
to
the
village
and
wait
for
me
susan
do
say
anything
to
baxter
it
may
just
possibly
be
bad
news
from
behind
the
curtain
she
watched
the
maid
go
down
the
path
saw
a
few
words
pass
between
her
and
the
stranger
and
then
the
maid
come
back
she
waited
breathless
yes
miss
it
is
a
cathcart
he
said
he
would
wait
for
you
maggie
nodded
i
will
go
she
said
remember
please
do
not
say
a
word
to
anyone
it
may
be
bad
news
as
i
said
as
she
walked
through
the
hamlet
three
minutes
later
she
began
to
recognize
that
the
news
must
be
really
serious
and
that
beneath
all
her
serenity
she
had
been
aware
of
its
possibility
so
intense
now
was
that
anxiety
though
perfectly
formless
in
its
details
that
all
other
faculties
seemed
absorbed
into
it
she
could
not
frame
any
imagination
as
to
what
it
meant
she
could
form
no
plan
alternative
or
absolute
as
to
what
must
be
done
she
was
only
aware
that
something
had
happened
and
that
she
would
know
the
facts
in
a
few
seconds
about
fifty
yards
up
the
turning
she
saw
the
old
gentleman
waiting
he
was
in
his
london
clothes
and
spatted
and
made
a
curiously
incongruous
picture
there
in
the
lane
that
led
upwards
to
the
village
on
either
side
towered
the
trees
still
leafless
yet
bursting
with
life
and
overhead
chattered
the
birds
against
the
tender
midday
sky
of
spring
he
lifted
his
hat
as
she
came
to
him
but
they
spoke
no
word
of
greeting
tell
me
quickly
she
said
i
am
maggie
deronnais
he
turned
to
walk
by
her
side
saying
nothing
for
a
moment
the
facts
or
the
interpretation
he
asked
in
his
brisk
manner
i
will
just
say
first
that
i
have
seen
him
this
morning
oh
the
facts
she
said
quickly
please
well
he
is
going
to
morton
chambers
this
afternoon
he
says
what
one
moment
please
oh
he
is
not
seriously
ill
as
the
world
counts
illness
he
thought
he
was
just
very
tired
this
morning
i
went
round
to
call
on
him
he
was
in
bed
at
ten
when
i
left
him
then
i
came
straight
down
here
for
a
moment
she
thought
the
old
man
mad
the
relief
was
so
intense
that
she
flushed
scarlet
and
stopped
dead
in
the
middle
of
the
road
you
came
down
here
she
repeated
why
i
thought
he
looked
at
her
gravely
in
spite
of
the
incessant
twinkle
in
his
eyes
she
perceived
that
this
old
man
eyes
would
twinkle
at
a
he
stroked
his
grey
beard
smoothly
down
yes
you
thought
that
he
was
dead
perhaps
oh
no
but
for
all
that
miss
deronnais
it
is
just
as
serious
as
it
can
be
she
did
not
know
what
to
think
was
the
man
a
madman
himself
listen
please
i
am
telling
you
simply
the
facts
i
was
anxious
and
i
went
round
this
morning
first
to
lady
laura
bethell
to
my
astonishment
she
saw
me
i
will
not
tell
you
all
that
she
said
just
now
she
was
in
a
terrible
state
though
she
did
not
know
of
the
harm
well
after
what
she
told
me
i
went
round
straight
to
mitre
court
the
porter
was
inclined
not
to
let
me
in
well
i
went
in
and
straight
into
baxter
bedroom
and
i
found
there
he
stopped
yes
i
found
exactly
what
i
had
feared
and
expected
oh
tell
me
quickly
she
cried
wheeling
on
him
in
anger
he
looked
at
her
as
if
critically
for
a
moment
then
he
went
on
abruptly
i
found
baxter
in
bed
i
made
no
apology
at
all
i
said
simply
that
i
had
come
to
see
how
he
was
after
the
it
took
place
then
oh
yes
i
forgot
to
mention
that
lady
laura
would
pay
no
attention
to
me
yesterday
yes
it
took
place
well
baxter
did
not
seem
surprised
to
see
me
he
told
me
he
felt
tired
he
said
that
the
had
been
a
success
and
while
he
talked
i
watched
him
then
i
came
away
and
caught
the
i
do
understand
in
the
least
said
maggie
so
i
suppose
said
the
other
dryly
i
imagine
you
do
not
believe
in
spiritualism
at
all
i
mean
that
you
think
that
the
whole
thing
is
fraud
or
hysteria
yes
i
do
said
maggie
bravely
he
nodded
once
or
twice
so
do
most
sensible
people
well
miss
deronnais
i
have
come
to
warn
you
i
did
not
write
because
it
was
impossible
to
know
what
to
say
until
i
had
seen
you
and
heard
your
answer
to
that
question
at
the
same
time
i
wanted
to
lose
no
time
anything
may
happen
now
at
any
moment
i
wanted
to
tell
you
this
that
i
am
at
your
service
now
altogether
when
he
stopped
then
he
began
again
if
you
hear
no
further
news
for
the
present
may
i
ask
when
you
expect
to
see
baxter
again
in
easter
week
that
is
a
fortnight
off
do
you
think
you
could
persuade
him
to
come
down
here
next
week
instead
i
should
like
you
to
see
him
for
yourself
or
even
sooner
she
was
still
hopelessly
confused
with
these
apparent
alternations
she
still
wondered
whether
cathcart
were
as
mad
as
he
seemed
they
turned
as
the
village
came
in
sight
ahead
up
the
hill
next
week
i
could
try
she
said
mechanically
but
i
understand
he
held
up
a
gloved
hand
wait
till
you
have
seen
him
he
said
for
myself
i
shall
make
a
point
of
seeing
morton
every
day
to
hear
the
news
miss
deronnais
i
tell
you
plainly
that
you
alone
will
have
to
bear
the
weight
of
all
this
unless
baxter
oh
do
explain
she
said
almost
irritably
he
looked
at
her
with
those
irresistibly
twinkling
eyes
but
she
perceived
a
very
steady
will
behind
them
i
will
explain
nothing
at
all
he
said
now
that
i
have
seen
you
and
heard
what
you
think
except
this
single
point
what
you
have
to
be
prepared
for
is
the
news
that
baxter
has
suddenly
gone
out
of
his
mind
it
was
said
in
exactly
the
same
tone
as
his
previous
sentences
and
for
a
moment
she
did
not
catch
the
full
weight
of
its
meaning
she
stopped
and
looked
at
him
paling
gradually
yes
you
took
that
very
well
he
said
still
meeting
her
eyes
steadily
stop
keep
a
strong
hold
on
yourself
that
is
the
worst
you
have
to
hear
for
the
present
now
tell
me
immediately
whether
you
think
baxter
should
be
informed
or
not
her
leaping
heart
slowed
down
into
three
or
four
gulping
blows
at
the
base
of
her
throat
she
swallowed
with
difficulty
how
do
you
know
kindly
answer
my
question
he
said
do
you
think
baxter
oh
god
oh
god
sobbed
maggie
steady
steady
said
the
old
man
take
my
arm
miss
deronnais
she
shook
her
head
keeping
her
eyes
fixed
on
his
he
smiled
in
his
grey
beard
very
good
he
said
very
good
and
do
you
think
she
shook
her
head
again
no
not
one
word
she
is
his
mother
besides
she
is
not
the
kind
she
would
be
of
no
use
yes
it
is
as
i
thought
very
well
miss
deronnais
you
will
have
to
be
responsible
you
can
wire
for
me
at
any
moment
you
have
my
address
she
nodded
then
i
have
one
or
two
things
to
add
whatever
happens
do
not
lose
heart
for
one
moment
i
have
seen
these
cases
again
and
again
whatever
happens
too
do
not
put
yourself
into
a
doctor
hands
until
i
have
seen
baxter
for
myself
the
thing
may
come
suddenly
or
gradually
and
the
very
instant
you
are
convinced
it
is
coming
telegraph
to
me
i
will
be
here
two
hours
after
do
you
understand
they
halted
twenty
yards
from
the
turning
into
the
hamlet
he
looked
at
her
again
with
his
kindly
humorous
eyes
she
nodded
slowly
and
deliberately
repeating
in
her
own
mind
his
instructions
and
beneath
like
a
whirl
of
waters
questions
surged
to
and
fro
clamoring
for
answer
but
her
was
coming
back
each
instant
you
understand
miss
deronnais
he
said
again
i
understand
will
you
write
to
me
i
will
write
this
evening
once
more
then
get
him
down
next
week
watch
him
carefully
when
he
comes
consult
no
doctor
until
you
have
telegraphed
to
me
and
i
have
seen
him
she
drew
a
long
breath
nodding
almost
mechanically
miss
deronnais
let
me
tell
you
that
you
are
taking
it
magnificently
fear
nothing
pray
much
he
took
her
hand
for
a
moment
then
he
raised
his
hat
and
left
her
standing
there
ii
baxter
was
exceedingly
absorbed
just
now
in
a
new
pious
book
of
meditations
written
by
a
clergyman
a
nicely
bound
copy
of
it
which
she
had
ordered
specially
had
arrived
by
the
parcels
post
that
morning
and
she
had
been
sitting
in
the
ever
since
looking
through
it
and
marking
it
with
a
small
silver
pencil
religion
was
to
this
lady
what
horticulture
was
to
maggie
except
of
course
that
it
was
really
important
while
horticulture
was
not
she
often
wondered
that
maggie
did
not
seem
to
understand
of
course
she
went
to
mass
every
morning
dear
girl
but
religion
surely
was
much
more
than
that
one
should
be
able
to
sit
for
two
or
three
hours
over
a
book
in
the
before
the
fire
with
a
silver
pencil
so
at
lunch
she
prattled
of
the
book
almost
continuously
and
at
the
end
of
it
thought
maggie
more
unsubtle
than
ever
she
looked
rather
tired
and
strained
thought
the
old
lady
and
she
hardly
said
a
word
from
beginning
to
end
the
drive
in
the
afternoon
was
equally
unsatisfactory
baxter
took
the
book
with
her
and
the
pencil
in
order
to
read
aloud
a
few
extracts
here
and
there
and
she
again
seemed
to
find
maggie
rather
vacuous
and
silent
dearest
child
you
are
not
very
well
i
think
she
said
at
last
maggie
roused
herself
suddenly
what
auntie
you
are
not
very
well
i
think
did
you
sleep
well
oh
i
slept
all
right
said
maggie
vaguely
but
after
tea
baxter
did
not
feel
very
well
herself
she
said
she
thought
she
must
have
taken
a
little
chill
maggie
looked
at
her
with
unperceptive
eyes
i
am
sorry
she
said
mechanically
dearest
you
do
seem
very
overwhelmed
i
think
perhaps
i
shall
have
dinner
in
bed
give
me
my
book
child
yes
and
the
baxter
room
was
so
comfortable
and
the
book
so
fascinatingly
spiritual
that
she
determined
to
keep
her
resolution
and
go
to
bed
she
felt
feverish
just
to
the
extent
of
being
very
sleepy
and
at
her
ease
she
rang
her
bell
and
issued
her
commands
a
little
of
the
she
said
with
a
spoonful
of
soup
before
it
no
no
meat
but
a
custard
or
so
and
a
little
fruit
oh
yes
charlotte
and
tell
miss
maggie
not
to
come
and
see
me
after
dinner
it
seemed
that
the
message
had
roused
the
dear
girl
at
last
for
maggie
appeared
ten
minutes
later
in
quite
a
different
mood
there
was
really
some
animation
in
her
face
dear
auntie
i
am
so
very
sorry
yes
do
go
to
bed
and
breakfast
there
in
the
morning
too
i
just
writing
to
laurie
by
the
way
baxter
nodded
sleepily
from
her
deep
chair
he
coming
down
in
easter
week
is
he
so
he
says
my
dear
why
should
he
come
next
week
instead
auntie
and
be
with
us
for
easter
you
like
that
would
you
very
nice
indeed
dear
child
but
do
bother
the
boy
and
you
do
think
it
influenza
put
in
maggie
swiftly
laying
a
cool
hand
on
the
old
lady
she
maintained
it
was
not
it
was
just
a
little
chill
such
as
she
had
had
this
time
last
year
and
it
became
necessary
to
rouse
herself
a
little
to
enumerate
the
symptoms
by
the
time
she
had
done
attention
had
begun
to
wander
again
the
old
lady
had
never
known
her
so
unsympathetic
before
and
said
so
with
gentle
peevishness
maggie
kissed
her
quickly
i
sorry
auntie
she
said
i
was
just
thinking
of
something
sleep
well
and
do
get
up
in
the
morning
then
she
left
her
to
a
spoonful
of
soup
a
little
a
custard
some
fruit
her
spiritual
book
and
contentment
downstairs
she
dined
alone
in
the
and
she
revolved
for
the
twentieth
time
the
thoughts
that
had
been
continuously
with
her
since
midday
moving
before
her
like
a
kaleidoscope
incessantly
changing
their
relations
their
shapes
and
their
suggestions
these
tended
to
form
themselves
into
two
main
alternative
classes
either
cathcart
was
a
harmless
fanatic
or
he
was
unusually
sharp
but
these
again
had
almost
endless
subdivisions
for
at
present
she
had
no
idea
of
what
was
really
in
his
mind
as
to
what
his
hints
meant
either
this
curious
old
gentleman
with
shrewd
humorous
eyes
was
entirely
wrong
and
laurie
was
just
suffering
from
a
nervous
strain
not
severe
enough
to
hinder
him
from
reading
law
in
morton
chambers
and
this
was
all
the
substratum
of
cathcart
mysteries
or
else
cathcart
was
right
and
laurie
was
in
the
presence
of
some
danger
called
insanity
which
cathcart
interpreted
in
some
strange
fashion
she
could
not
understand
and
beneath
all
this
again
moved
the
further
questions
as
to
what
spiritualism
really
was
what
it
professed
to
be
or
mere
superstitious
nonsense
or
something
else
she
was
amazed
that
she
had
not
demanded
greater
explicitness
this
morning
but
the
thing
had
been
so
startling
so
suggestive
at
first
so
insignificant
in
its
substance
that
her
ordinary
common
sense
had
deserted
her
the
old
gentleman
had
come
and
gone
like
a
wraith
had
uttered
a
few
inconclusive
sentences
and
promised
to
write
had
been
disappointed
with
her
at
one
moment
and
enthusiastic
the
next
obviously
their
planes
ran
neither
parallel
nor
opposing
they
cut
at
unexpected
points
and
maggie
had
no
notion
as
to
the
direction
in
which
his
lay
all
she
saw
plainly
was
that
there
was
some
point
of
view
other
than
hers
so
then
she
revolved
theories
questioned
argued
doubted
with
herself
one
thing
only
emerged
the
old
lady
feverish
cold
afforded
her
exactly
the
opportunity
she
wished
she
could
write
to
laurie
with
perfect
truthfulness
that
his
mother
had
taken
to
her
bed
and
that
she
hoped
he
would
come
down
next
week
instead
of
the
week
after
after
dinner
she
sat
down
and
wrote
it
pausing
many
times
to
consider
a
phrase
then
she
read
a
little
and
soon
after
ten
went
upstairs
to
bed
iii
it
was
a
little
before
sunset
on
that
day
that
james
morton
turned
down
on
to
the
embankment
to
walk
up
to
the
westminster
underground
to
take
him
home
he
was
a
great
man
on
physical
exercise
and
it
was
a
matter
of
principle
with
him
to
live
far
from
his
work
as
he
came
down
the
little
passage
he
found
his
friend
waiting
for
him
and
together
they
turned
up
towards
where
in
the
distance
the
westminster
towers
rose
high
and
blue
against
the
evening
sky
well
said
the
old
man
morton
looked
at
him
with
a
humorous
eye
you
are
a
hopeless
case
he
said
kindly
tell
me
what
you
noticed
my
dear
man
he
said
there
absolutely
nothing
to
say
i
did
exactly
what
you
said
i
hardly
spoke
to
him
at
all
i
watched
him
very
carefully
indeed
i
really
ca
go
on
doing
that
day
after
day
i
got
my
own
work
to
do
it
the
most
utter
bunkum
i
ever
tell
me
anything
odd
that
you
saw
there
was
nothing
odd
at
all
except
that
the
boy
looked
tired
as
you
saw
for
yourself
this
morning
did
he
behave
exactly
as
usual
exactly
except
that
he
was
quieter
he
fidgeted
a
little
with
his
fingers
yes
and
he
seemed
very
hard
at
work
i
caught
him
looking
at
me
once
or
twice
yes
how
did
he
look
he
just
looked
at
me
that
was
all
good
lord
what
do
you
want
and
there
was
nothing
else
absolutely
nothing
else
absolutely
nothing
else
he
did
complain
of
of
anything
lord
oh
yes
he
did
say
something
about
a
headache
ah
the
old
man
leaned
forward
a
headache
what
kind
back
of
his
head
the
old
man
sat
back
with
pursed
lips
did
he
talk
about
last
night
he
went
on
again
suddenly
not
a
word
ah
morton
burst
into
a
rude
uproarious
laugh
upon
my
word
he
said
i
think
cathcart
you
the
most
amazingly
the
other
held
up
a
gloved
hand
in
deprecation
but
he
did
not
seem
at
all
ruffled
yes
yes
we
can
take
all
that
as
said
i
accustomed
to
it
my
dear
fellow
well
i
saw
miss
deronnais
as
i
told
you
i
should
in
my
note
you
quite
right
about
her
pleased
to
hear
it
i
sure
said
morton
solemnly
she
one
in
a
thousand
i
told
her
right
out
you
know
that
i
feared
insanity
oh
you
did
that
tactful
how
did
she
she
took
it
admirably
and
did
you
tell
her
your
delightful
theories
i
did
not
she
will
see
all
that
for
herself
i
expect
meantime
oh
you
did
tell
me
about
your
interview
with
lady
laura
the
old
face
grew
a
little
grim
ah
that
not
finished
yet
he
said
i
on
my
way
to
her
now
i
do
think
she
play
with
the
thing
again
just
yet
and
the
others
the
medium
and
so
on
they
will
have
to
take
their
chance
it
absolutely
useless
going
to
them
they
as
bad
as
i
am
i
expect
the
old
man
turned
a
sharp
face
to
him
oh
you
know
nothing
whatever
about
it
he
said
you
count
but
they
do
know
quite
enough
in
the
underground
the
two
talked
no
more
but
morton
affecting
to
read
his
paper
glanced
up
once
or
twice
at
the
old
shrewd
face
opposite
that
stared
so
steadily
out
of
the
window
into
the
roaring
darkness
and
once
more
he
reflected
how
astonishing
it
was
that
anyone
in
these
days
anyone
at
least
possessing
common
sense
and
common
sense
was
written
all
over
that
old
bearded
face
could
believe
such
fantastic
rubbish
as
that
which
had
been
lately
discussed
it
was
not
only
the
particular
points
that
regarded
laurie
baxter
all
these
absurd
though
disquieting
hints
about
insanity
and
suicide
and
the
rest
of
it
but
the
principles
that
old
cathcart
declared
to
be
beneath
those
principles
which
he
had
apparently
not
confided
to
miss
deronnais
here
was
the
twentieth
century
here
was
an
electric
railway
padded
seats
and
the
was
further
comment
required
the
train
began
to
slow
up
at
gloucester
road
and
old
cathcart
gathered
up
his
umbrella
and
gloves
then
tomorrow
he
said
at
the
same
time
morton
made
a
resigned
gesture
but
why
do
you
go
and
have
it
out
with
him
yourself
he
asked
he
would
not
listen
to
me
less
than
ever
now
good
night
the
train
slid
on
again
into
the
darkness
and
the
lawyer
sat
for
a
moment
with
pursed
lips
yes
of
course
the
boy
was
overwrought
anyone
could
see
that
he
had
stammered
a
little
a
sure
sign
but
why
make
all
this
fuss
a
week
in
the
country
would
set
him
right
then
he
opened
the
again
resolutely
i
and
nugent
were
enjoying
their
holiday
exceedingly
on
good
friday
they
had
driven
laboriously
in
a
waggonette
to
royston
where
they
had
visited
the
hermit
cave
in
company
with
other
grandees
of
their
village
and
held
a
stately
picnic
on
the
downs
they
had
returned
the
gentlemen
of
the
party
slightly
flushed
with
brandy
and
water
from
the
various
hostelries
on
the
home
journey
and
the
ladies
severe
with
watercress
on
their
laps
accordingly
on
the
saturday
nugent
had
thought
it
better
to
stay
indoors
and
dispatch
her
husband
to
the
scene
of
the
first
cricket
match
of
the
season
a
couple
of
miles
away
at
about
five
she
made
herself
a
cup
of
tea
and
did
not
wake
up
from
the
sleep
which
followed
until
the
evening
was
closing
in
she
awoke
with
a
start
remembering
that
she
had
intended
to
give
a
good
look
between
the
spare
bedroom
that
had
been
her
daughter
and
possibly
make
a
change
or
two
of
the
furniture
there
was
a
mahogany
wardrobe
and
so
forth
she
had
not
entered
this
room
very
often
since
the
death
it
had
come
to
resemble
to
her
mind
a
sort
of
melancholy
sanctuary
symbolical
of
glories
that
might
have
been
for
she
and
her
husband
were
full
of
the
glorious
day
that
had
begun
to
dawn
when
laurie
very
constrained
though
very
ardent
had
called
upon
them
in
state
to
disclose
his
intentions
well
it
had
been
a
false
dawn
but
at
least
it
could
be
and
was
still
talked
about
in
sad
and
suggestive
whispers
it
seemed
full
then
of
a
mysterious
splendor
when
she
entered
it
this
evening
candle
in
hand
and
stood
regarding
it
from
the
threshold
to
the
outward
eye
it
was
nothing
very
startling
a
shrouded
bed
protruded
from
the
wall
opposite
with
the
words
the
lord
preserve
thee
from
all
evil
illuminated
in
pink
and
gold
by
the
girl
own
hand
an
oleograph
of
queen
victoria
in
coronation
robes
hung
on
one
side
and
the
painted
photograph
of
a
nonconformist
divine
bible
in
hand
whiskered
and
cravatted
upon
the
other
there
was
a
small
table
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
adorned
with
an
almost
continuous
line
of
nails
as
a
kind
of
beading
round
the
edge
in
the
center
of
which
rested
the
plaster
image
of
a
young
person
clasping
a
cross
a
and
a
bible
stood
before
this
and
a
small
jar
of
wilted
flowers
against
the
opposite
wall
flanked
by
and
another
text
or
two
stood
the
great
mahogany
wardrobe
whose
removal
was
vaguely
in
contemplation
nugent
regarded
the
whole
with
a
tender
kind
of
severity
shaking
her
head
slowly
from
side
to
side
with
the
tin
candlestick
slightly
tilted
she
was
a
lady
in
clothes
rather
too
tight
for
her
and
she
panted
a
little
after
the
ascent
of
the
stairs
it
seemed
to
her
once
more
a
strangely
and
inexplicably
perverse
act
of
providence
to
whom
she
had
always
paid
deference
by
which
so
incalculable
a
rise
in
the
social
scale
had
been
denied
to
her
then
she
advanced
a
step
her
eyes
straying
from
the
shrouded
bed
to
the
wardrobe
and
back
again
then
she
set
the
candlestick
upon
the
table
and
turned
round
it
must
now
be
premised
that
nugent
was
utterly
without
a
trace
of
what
is
known
as
superstition
for
the
whole
evidential
value
of
what
follows
such
as
it
is
depends
upon
that
fact
she
would
not
by
preference
sleep
in
a
room
immediately
after
a
death
had
taken
place
in
it
but
solely
for
the
reason
of
certain
physical
theories
which
she
would
have
summed
up
under
the
expression
that
it
was
but
right
that
the
air
should
be
changed
her
views
on
human
nature
and
its
component
parts
were
undoubtedly
practical
and
to
put
it
brutally
amy
body
was
in
the
churchyard
and
amy
soul
crowned
and
robed
in
heaven
so
there
was
no
more
to
account
for
she
knew
nothing
of
modern
theories
nothing
of
the
revival
of
ancient
beliefs
she
would
have
regarded
with
kindly
compassion
and
met
with
practical
comments
that
unwilling
shrinking
from
scenes
of
death
occasionally
manifested
by
certain
kind
of
temperaments
she
turned
then
and
looked
at
the
wardrobe
still
full
of
belongings
with
her
back
to
the
bed
in
which
amy
had
died
without
even
the
faintest
premonitory
symptom
of
the
unreasoning
terror
that
presently
seized
upon
her
it
came
about
in
this
way
she
kneeled
down
after
a
careful
scrutiny
of
the
polished
surface
of
the
mahogany
pulled
out
a
drawer
filled
to
brimming
over
with
linen
of
various
kinds
and
uses
and
began
to
dive
among
these
with
careful
housewifely
hands
to
discover
their
tale
simultaneously
as
she
remembered
afterwards
there
came
from
the
hill
leading
down
from
the
direction
of
the
station
the
sound
of
a
trotting
horse
she
paused
to
listen
her
mind
full
of
that
faint
gossipy
surmise
that
surges
so
quickly
up
in
the
thoughts
of
village
dwellers
her
hands
for
an
instant
motionless
among
the
linen
it
might
be
the
doctor
or
paton
or
grove
those
names
flashed
upon
her
but
an
instant
later
were
drowned
again
in
a
kind
of
fear
of
which
she
could
give
afterwards
no
account
it
seemed
to
her
she
said
that
there
was
something
coming
towards
her
that
set
her
and
when
a
moment
later
the
trotting
hoofs
rang
out
sharp
and
near
she
positively
relapsed
into
a
kind
of
sitting
position
on
the
floor
helpless
and
paralyzed
by
a
furious
of
terror
for
it
appeared
so
far
as
nugent
could
afterwards
make
it
out
as
if
a
sort
of
double
process
went
on
it
was
not
merely
that
fear
rushed
upon
with
the
approaching
wheels
outside
and
therefore
harmless
but
that
the
room
itself
in
which
she
crouched
itself
filled
with
some
atmosphere
swift
as
water
in
a
rising
lock
that
held
her
there
motionless
blind
and
dumb
with
horror
unable
to
move
even
to
lift
her
hands
or
turn
her
head
as
one
approached
the
other
rose
again
sounded
the
hoofs
and
wheels
near
now
and
imminent
again
they
hushed
as
the
corner
was
approached
then
once
more
as
they
broke
out
clear
and
distinct
not
twenty
yards
away
at
the
turning
into
the
village
nugent
no
longer
able
even
to
keep
that
rigid
position
of
fear
sank
gently
backwards
and
relapsed
in
a
huddle
on
the
floor
ii
nugent
was
astonished
and
even
a
little
peevish
when
on
arriving
home
after
dark
he
found
the
parlor
lamp
and
his
wife
absent
he
inquired
for
her
the
mistress
had
slipped
upstairs
scarcely
ten
minutes
ago
he
shouted
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
but
there
was
no
response
and
after
he
had
taken
his
boots
off
and
his
desire
for
supper
had
become
poignant
he
himself
stepped
upstairs
to
see
into
the
matter
it
was
several
minutes
even
after
the
conveyal
of
an
apparently
inanimate
body
downstairs
before
his
wife
first
made
clear
signs
of
intelligence
and
even
these
were
little
more
than
grotesque
expressions
of
fear
rolling
eyes
and
exclamations
it
was
another
quarter
of
an
hour
before
any
kind
of
connected
story
could
be
got
out
of
her
one
conclusion
only
was
evident
that
nugent
did
not
propose
to
fetch
the
forgotten
candle
still
burning
on
the
table
but
that
it
must
be
fetched
instantly
the
door
locked
on
the
outside
and
the
key
laid
before
her
on
that
tablecloth
these
were
the
terms
that
must
be
conceded
before
any
further
details
were
gone
into
plainly
there
was
but
one
person
to
carry
out
these
instructions
for
the
little
was
already
all
eyes
and
mouth
at
the
few
pregnant
sentences
that
had
fallen
from
her
mistress
lips
so
nugent
himself
cloth
cap
and
all
stepped
upstairs
once
more
he
paused
at
the
door
and
looked
in
all
was
entirely
as
usual
in
spite
of
the
unpleasant
expectancy
roused
in
spite
of
himself
and
his
godliness
by
the
words
of
his
wife
and
her
awful
the
room
gave
back
to
him
no
echo
or
lingering
scent
of
horror
the
little
bed
stood
there
white
and
innocent
in
the
candlelight
the
drawer
still
gaped
showing
its
pathetic
contents
the
furniture
pictures
texts
and
all
the
rest
remained
in
their
places
harmless
and
undefiled
as
when
amy
herself
had
set
them
there
he
looked
carefully
round
before
entering
then
stepping
forward
he
took
the
candle
closed
the
drawer
not
without
difficulty
glanced
round
once
more
and
went
out
locking
the
door
behind
him
a
pack
of
nonsense
he
said
as
he
tossed
the
key
on
to
the
table
before
his
wife
the
theological
discussion
waxed
late
that
night
and
by
ten
nugent
under
the
influence
of
an
excellent
supper
and
a
touch
of
stimulant
had
begun
to
condemn
her
own
terrors
or
rather
to
cease
to
protest
when
her
husband
condemned
them
for
her
a
number
of
solutions
had
been
proposed
for
the
startling
little
incident
to
none
of
which
did
she
give
an
unqualified
denial
it
was
the
stooping
that
had
done
it
there
had
been
a
rush
of
blood
to
the
head
that
had
emptied
the
heart
and
caused
the
sinking
feeling
it
was
the
watercress
eaten
in
such
abundance
on
the
previous
afternoon
it
was
the
fact
that
she
had
passed
an
unoccupied
morning
owing
to
the
closing
of
the
shop
it
was
one
of
those
things
or
all
of
them
or
some
other
like
one
of
them
even
the
little
maid
was
reassured
when
she
came
to
take
away
the
supper
things
by
the
cheerful
conversation
of
the
couple
though
she
registered
a
private
vow
that
for
no
consideration
under
heaven
would
she
enter
the
bedroom
on
the
right
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
about
ten
nugent
said
that
she
would
step
up
to
bed
and
in
that
direction
she
went
accompanied
by
her
husband
whose
program
it
was
presently
to
step
round
to
the
wheatsheaf
for
an
hour
with
the
landlord
after
the
bar
was
shut
up
at
the
door
on
the
right
hand
he
hesitated
but
his
wife
passed
on
sternly
and
as
she
passed
into
their
own
bedroom
a
piece
of
news
came
to
his
mind
that
was
laurie
you
heard
mary
said
he
jim
told
me
he
saw
him
go
past
just
after
dark
well
i
take
the
with
me
i
when
is
he
coming
asked
baxter
with
a
touch
of
peevishness
as
she
sat
propped
up
in
her
tall
chair
before
the
bedroom
fire
he
will
be
here
about
six
said
maggie
are
you
sure
you
have
finished
the
old
lady
turned
away
her
head
from
the
rice
pudding
in
a
kind
of
gesture
of
repulsion
she
was
in
the
fractious
period
of
influenza
and
maggie
had
had
a
hard
time
with
her
nothing
particular
had
happened
for
the
last
ten
days
feverish
cold
had
developed
and
she
was
but
now
emerging
from
the
nightdress
and
stage
to
that
of
the
petticoat
and
it
was
all
very
ordinary
and
untragic
and
maggie
had
had
but
little
time
to
consider
the
events
on
which
her
subconscious
attention
still
dwelt
cathcart
had
had
no
particular
news
to
give
her
laurie
it
seemed
was
working
silently
with
his
coach
talking
little
yet
the
old
man
did
not
for
one
instant
withdraw
one
word
that
he
had
said
only
in
answer
to
a
series
of
positive
inquiries
from
the
girl
two
days
before
he
had
told
her
to
wait
and
see
him
for
herself
warning
her
at
the
same
time
to
show
no
signs
of
perturbation
to
the
boy
and
now
the
day
was
come
easter
eve
as
it
happened
and
she
would
see
him
before
night
he
had
sent
no
answer
to
her
first
letter
then
finally
a
telegram
had
come
that
morning
announcing
his
train
she
was
wondering
with
all
her
might
that
afternoon
as
to
what
she
would
see
in
a
way
she
was
terrified
in
another
way
she
was
contemptuous
the
evidence
was
so
extraordinarily
confused
if
he
were
in
danger
of
insanity
how
was
it
that
cathcart
advised
her
to
get
him
down
to
a
house
with
only
two
women
and
a
few
maids
who
was
there
besides
this
old
gentleman
who
ever
dreamed
that
such
a
danger
was
possible
how
if
it
was
so
obvious
that
she
would
see
the
change
for
herself
was
it
that
others
morton
for
example
had
not
seen
it
too
more
than
ever
the
theory
gained
force
in
her
mind
that
the
whole
thing
was
grossly
exaggerated
by
this
old
man
and
that
all
that
was
the
matter
with
laurie
was
a
certain
nervous
strain
yet
for
all
that
as
the
afternoon
closed
in
she
felt
her
nerves
tightening
she
walked
a
little
in
the
garden
while
the
old
lady
took
her
nap
she
came
in
to
read
to
her
again
from
the
little
book
as
the
afternoon
light
began
to
fade
then
after
tea
she
went
under
orders
to
see
for
herself
whether
laurie
room
was
as
it
should
be
it
struck
her
with
an
odd
sense
of
strangeness
as
she
went
in
she
scarcely
knew
why
she
told
herself
it
was
because
of
what
she
had
heard
of
him
lately
but
all
was
as
it
should
be
there
were
spring
flowers
on
the
table
and
mantelshelf
and
a
pleasant
fire
on
the
hearth
it
was
even
reassuring
after
she
had
been
there
a
minute
or
two
then
she
went
to
look
at
the
where
she
had
sat
with
him
and
heard
the
curious
noise
of
the
cracking
wood
on
the
night
of
the
thaw
when
the
boy
had
behaved
so
foolishly
here
too
was
a
fire
a
tall
porter
chair
drawn
on
one
side
with
its
back
to
the
door
and
a
deep
leather
couch
set
opposite
there
was
a
box
of
cigarettes
set
ready
on
the
table
candles
matches
flowers
the
illustrated
papers
yes
everything
but
she
stood
looking
on
it
all
for
a
few
moments
with
an
odd
emotion
it
was
familiar
homely
domestic
yet
it
was
strange
there
was
an
air
of
expectation
about
it
all
then
on
a
sudden
the
emotions
precipitated
themselves
in
tenderness
ah
poor
laurie
it
is
all
perfectly
right
she
said
to
the
old
lady
are
the
cigarettes
there
yes
i
noticed
them
particularly
and
flowers
yes
flowers
too
what
time
is
it
my
dear
i
ca
see
maggie
peered
at
the
clock
it
just
after
six
auntie
will
you
have
the
candles
the
old
lady
shook
her
head
no
my
dear
my
eyes
ca
stand
the
light
why
has
the
boy
come
why
it
hardly
time
yet
shall
i
bring
him
up
at
once
just
for
two
minutes
sighed
the
old
lady
my
head
bad
again
poor
dear
said
maggie
sit
down
my
dearest
for
a
few
minutes
you
hear
the
wheels
from
here
no
do
talk
or
read
there
then
the
two
women
sat
waiting
outside
the
twilight
was
falling
layer
on
layer
over
the
spring
garden
in
a
great
stillness
the
chilly
wind
of
the
afternoon
had
dropped
and
there
was
scarcely
a
sound
to
be
heard
from
the
living
things
about
the
house
that
once
more
were
renewing
their
strength
yet
over
all
to
the
catholic
mind
at
least
there
lay
a
shadow
of
death
from
associations
with
that
strange
anniversary
that
was
passing
hour
by
hour
as
to
what
maggie
thought
during
those
minutes
of
waiting
she
could
have
given
afterwards
no
coherent
description
matters
were
too
complicated
to
think
clearly
she
knew
so
little
there
were
so
many
hypotheses
yet
one
emotion
dominated
the
rest
expectancy
with
a
tinge
of
fear
here
she
sat
in
this
peaceful
room
with
all
the
homely
paraphernalia
of
convalescence
about
her
the
fire
the
bed
laid
invitingly
open
with
a
couple
of
books
and
a
on
the
little
table
at
the
side
the
faint
smell
of
sandalwood
and
before
the
fire
dozed
a
peaceful
old
lady
full
too
of
gentle
expectation
of
her
son
yet
knowing
nothing
whatever
of
the
vague
perils
that
were
about
him
that
had
indeed
whatever
they
were
already
closed
in
on
him
and
that
son
was
approaching
nearer
every
instant
through
the
country
lanes
she
rose
at
last
and
went
on
tiptoe
to
the
window
the
curtains
had
not
yet
been
drawn
and
she
could
see
in
the
fading
light
the
elaborate
ironwork
of
the
tall
gate
in
the
fence
and
the
common
road
outside
it
gleaming
here
and
there
in
puddles
that
caught
the
green
color
from
the
dying
western
sky
in
front
on
the
lawn
on
this
side
burned
tiny
patches
of
white
where
the
crocuses
sprouted
as
she
stood
there
there
came
a
sound
of
wheels
and
a
carriage
came
in
sight
it
drew
up
at
the
gate
and
the
door
opened
ii
he
is
come
said
the
girl
softly
as
she
saw
the
tall
ulstered
figure
appear
from
the
carriage
there
was
no
answer
and
as
she
went
on
tiptoe
to
the
fire
she
saw
that
the
old
lady
was
asleep
she
went
noiselessly
out
of
the
room
and
stood
for
an
instant
every
pulse
racing
with
horrible
excitement
listening
to
the
footsteps
and
voices
in
the
hall
then
she
drew
a
long
trembling
breath
steadied
herself
with
a
huge
effort
of
the
will
and
went
downstairs
laurie
gone
into
the
miss
said
the
servant
looking
at
her
oddly
he
was
standing
by
the
table
as
she
went
in
so
much
she
could
see
but
the
candles
were
unlighted
and
no
more
was
visible
of
him
than
his
outline
against
the
darkening
window
well
laurie
she
said
well
maggie
said
his
voice
in
answer
and
their
hands
met
then
in
an
instant
she
knew
that
something
was
wrong
yet
at
the
moment
she
had
not
an
idea
as
to
what
it
was
that
told
her
that
it
was
laurie
voice
surely
you
all
in
the
dark
she
said
there
was
no
movement
or
word
in
answer
she
passed
her
hand
along
the
mantelpiece
for
the
matches
she
had
seen
there
just
before
but
her
hand
shook
so
much
that
some
little
metal
ornament
fell
with
a
crash
as
she
fumbled
there
and
she
drew
a
long
almost
vocal
breath
of
sudden
nervous
alarm
and
still
there
was
no
movement
in
answer
only
the
tall
figure
stood
watching
her
it
seemed
a
pale
luminous
patch
showing
her
his
face
then
she
found
the
matches
and
struck
one
and
keeping
her
face
downcast
lighted
with
fingers
that
shook
violently
the
two
candles
on
the
little
table
by
the
fire
she
must
just
be
natural
and
ordinary
she
kept
on
telling
herself
then
with
another
fierce
effort
of
will
she
began
to
speak
lifting
her
eyes
to
his
face
as
she
did
so
auntie
just
fallen
her
voice
died
suddenly
for
an
instant
as
she
saw
him
looking
at
her
then
she
finished
just
fallen
asleep
will
you
come
up
presently
laurie
every
word
was
an
effort
as
she
looked
steadily
into
the
eyes
that
looked
so
steadily
into
hers
it
was
laurie
yes
but
good
god
you
must
just
kiss
her
and
come
away
she
said
driving
out
the
words
with
effort
after
effort
she
has
a
bad
headache
this
evening
laurie
a
bad
headache
with
a
sudden
twitch
she
turned
away
from
those
eyes
come
laurie
she
said
and
she
heard
his
steps
following
her
they
passed
so
through
the
inner
hall
and
upstairs
and
without
turning
again
holding
herself
steady
only
by
the
consciousness
that
some
appalling
catastrophe
was
imminent
if
she
did
not
she
opened
the
door
of
the
old
lady
room
here
he
is
she
said
now
laurie
just
kiss
her
and
come
away
my
dearest
came
the
old
voice
from
the
gloom
and
two
hands
were
lifted
maggie
watched
as
the
tall
figure
came
obediently
forward
in
an
indescribable
terror
it
was
as
when
one
watches
a
man
in
a
den
but
the
figure
bent
obediently
and
kissed
maggie
instantly
stepped
forward
not
a
word
she
said
auntie
got
a
headache
yes
auntie
very
well
you
see
him
in
the
morning
go
out
at
once
please
laurie
without
a
word
he
passed
out
and
as
she
closed
the
door
after
him
she
heard
him
stop
irresolute
on
the
landing
my
dearest
child
came
the
peevish
old
voice
you
might
have
allowed
my
own
son
no
no
auntie
you
really
must
i
know
how
bad
your
head
is
yes
yes
he
very
well
you
see
him
in
the
morning
and
all
the
while
she
was
conscious
of
the
figure
that
must
be
faced
again
presently
waiting
on
the
landing
shall
i
go
and
see
that
everything
all
right
in
his
room
she
said
perhaps
they
forgotten
yes
my
dearest
go
and
see
and
send
charlotte
to
me
the
old
voice
was
growing
drowsy
again
maggie
went
out
swiftly
without
a
word
there
again
stood
the
figure
waiting
the
landing
lamp
had
been
forgotten
she
led
the
way
to
his
room
come
laurie
she
said
i
just
see
that
everything
all
right
she
found
the
matches
again
lighted
the
candles
and
set
them
on
his
table
still
without
a
look
at
that
face
that
turned
always
as
she
went
we
shall
have
to
dine
alone
she
said
striving
to
make
her
voice
natural
as
she
reached
the
door
then
once
more
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
and
looked
him
bravely
in
the
face
as
he
stood
by
the
fire
do
just
as
you
like
about
dressing
she
said
i
expect
tired
she
could
bear
it
no
more
she
went
out
without
another
word
passed
steadily
across
the
length
of
the
landing
to
her
own
room
locked
the
door
and
threw
herself
on
her
knees
iii
she
was
roused
by
a
tap
on
the
door
how
much
later
she
did
not
know
but
the
agony
was
passed
for
the
present
the
repulsion
and
the
horror
of
what
she
had
seen
perhaps
it
was
that
she
did
not
yet
understand
the
whole
truth
but
at
least
her
will
was
dominant
she
was
as
a
man
who
has
fought
with
fear
alone
and
walks
white
and
trembling
yet
perfectly
himself
to
the
operating
table
she
opened
the
door
and
susan
stood
there
with
a
candle
in
one
hand
and
a
scrap
of
white
in
the
other
for
you
miss
said
the
maid
maggie
took
it
without
a
word
and
read
the
name
and
the
penciled
message
twice
just
light
the
lamp
out
here
she
said
oh
and
by
the
way
send
charlotte
to
baxter
at
once
yes
miss
the
maid
still
paused
eyeing
her
as
if
with
an
unspoken
question
there
was
terror
too
in
her
eyes
laurie
is
not
very
well
said
maggie
steadily
please
take
no
notice
of
anything
and
and
susan
i
think
i
shall
dine
alone
this
evening
just
a
tray
up
here
will
do
if
laurie
says
anything
just
explain
that
i
am
looking
after
baxter
and
susan
yes
miss
please
see
that
baxter
is
not
told
that
i
am
not
dining
downstairs
yes
miss
maggie
still
stood
an
instant
hesitating
then
a
thought
recurred
again
one
moment
she
said
she
stepped
across
the
room
to
her
beckoning
the
maid
to
come
inside
and
shut
the
door
then
she
wrote
rapidly
for
a
minute
or
so
enclosed
her
note
directed
it
and
gave
it
to
the
girl
just
send
up
someone
at
once
will
you
with
this
to
father
mahon
on
a
bicycle
when
the
maid
was
gone
she
waited
still
for
an
instant
looking
across
the
dark
landing
expectant
of
some
sound
or
movement
but
all
was
still
a
line
of
light
showed
only
under
the
door
where
the
boy
who
was
called
laurie
baxter
stood
or
sat
at
least
he
was
not
moving
about
there
in
the
darkness
maggie
tested
her
power
of
resisting
panic
panic
was
the
one
fatal
thing
so
much
she
understood
even
if
that
silent
door
had
opened
she
knew
she
could
stand
there
still
she
went
back
took
a
wrap
from
the
chair
where
she
had
tossed
it
down
on
coming
in
from
the
garden
that
afternoon
threw
it
over
her
head
and
shoulders
passed
down
the
stairs
and
out
through
the
garden
once
more
in
the
darkness
of
the
spring
evening
all
was
quiet
in
the
tiny
hamlet
as
she
went
along
the
road
a
blaze
of
light
shone
from
the
window
where
the
fathers
of
families
were
talking
together
and
within
nugent
shuttered
shop
she
could
see
through
the
doorway
the
grocer
himself
in
his
shifting
something
on
the
counter
so
great
was
the
tension
to
which
she
had
strung
herself
that
she
did
not
even
envy
the
ordinariness
of
these
people
they
appeared
to
be
in
some
other
world
not
attainable
by
herself
these
were
busied
with
domestic
affairs
with
beer
or
cheese
or
gossip
her
task
was
of
another
kind
so
much
she
knew
and
as
to
what
that
task
was
she
was
about
to
learn
as
she
turned
the
corner
the
figure
she
expected
was
waiting
there
and
she
could
see
in
the
deep
twilight
that
he
lifted
his
hat
to
her
she
went
straight
up
to
him
yes
she
said
i
have
seen
for
myself
you
are
right
so
far
now
tell
me
what
to
do
it
was
no
time
for
conventionality
she
did
not
ask
why
the
solicitor
was
there
it
was
enough
that
he
had
come
walk
this
way
then
with
me
he
said
now
tell
me
what
you
have
seen
i
have
seen
a
change
i
can
not
describe
at
all
it
just
someone
else
not
laurie
at
all
i
do
understand
it
in
the
least
but
i
just
want
to
know
what
to
do
i
have
written
to
father
mahon
to
come
he
was
silent
for
a
step
or
two
i
can
not
tell
you
what
to
do
i
must
leave
that
to
yourself
i
can
only
tell
you
what
not
to
do
very
well
miss
deronnais
you
are
magnificent
there
it
is
said
now
then
you
must
not
get
excited
or
frightened
whatever
happens
i
do
not
believe
that
you
are
in
any
danger
not
of
the
ordinary
kind
i
mean
but
if
you
want
me
i
shall
be
at
the
inn
i
have
taken
rooms
there
for
a
night
or
so
and

must
not
yield
to
him
interiorly
i
wonder

think

shall
understand

present

have
said

the
servants
one
of
them
at
least
suspects
something
but
i
will
sit
with
him
afterwards
if
that
is
right
very
good
you
must
be
with
him
as
much
as
you
can
remember
it
is
not
the
worst
yet
it
is
to
prevent
that
worst
happening
that
you
must
use
all
the
power
you
got
am
i
to
speak
to
him
straight
out
and
what
shall
i
tell
father
mahon
you
must
use
your
judgment
your
object
is
to
fight
on
his
side
remember
against
this
thing
that
is
obsessing
him
miss
deronnais
i
must
give
you
another
warning
she
bowed
she
did
not
wish
to
use
more
words
than
were
necessary
the
strain
was
frightful
it
is
this
whatever
you
may
see
little
tricks
of
speech
or
movement
you
must
not
for
one
instant
yield
to
the
thought
that
the
creature
that
is
obsessing
him
is
what
he
thinks
it
is
remember
the
thing
is
wholly
evil
wholly
evil
but
it
may
perhaps
do
its
utmost
to
hide
that
and
to
keep
up
the
illusion
it
is
intelligent
but
not
brilliant
it
has
the
intelligence
only
of
some
venomous
brute
in
the
slime
or
it
may
try
to
frighten
you
you
must
not
be
frightened
she
understood
hints
here
and
there
of
what
the
old
man
said
enough
at
any
rate
to
act
and
you
must
keep
up
to
the
utmost
pitch
your
sympathy
with
himself
you
must
remember
that
he
is
somewhere
there
underneath
in
chains
and
that
probably
he
is
struggling
too
and
needs
you
it
is
not
possession
yet
he
is
still
partly
conscious
did
he
know
you
yes
he
just
knew
me
he
was
puzzled
i
think
has
he
seen
anyone
else
he
knows
his
mother
yes
he
just
knew
her
too
he
did
not
speak
to
her
i
would
not
let
him
miss
deronnais
you
have
acted
admirably
what
is
he
doing
now
i
do
know
i
left
him
in
his
room
he
was
quite
quiet
you
must
go
back
directly
shall
we
turn
i
do
think
much
more
to
say
just
now
then
she
noticed
that
he
had
said
nothing
about
the
priest
and
what
about
father
mahon
she
said
the
old
man
was
silent
a
moment
well
she
said
again
miss
deronnais
i
would
rely
on
father
mahon
i
hardly
ever
met
a
priest
who
takes
these
things
seriously
in
theory
yes
of
course
but
not
in
concrete
instances
however
father
mahon
may
be
an
exception
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
the
priesthood
has
enormous
power
if
they
only
knew
it
the
tinkle
of
a
bicycle
bell
sounded
down
the
road
behind
them
maggie
wheeled
on
the
instant
and
caught
the
profile
she
was
expecting
is
that
you
she
said
as
the
rider
passed
the
man
jumped
off
touched
his
hat
and
handed
her
a
note
she
tore
it
open
and
glanced
through
it
in
the
light
of
the
bicycle
lamp
then
she
crumpled
it
up
and
threw
it
into
the
ditch
with
a
quick
impatient
movement
all
right
she
said
good
night
the
gardener
mounted
his
bicycle
again
and
moved
off
well
said
the
old
man
father
mahon
called
away
suddenly
it
from
his
housekeeper
he
only
be
back
in
time
for
the
first
mass
tomorrow
the
other
nodded
three
or
four
times
as
if
in
assent
why
do
you
do
that
asked
the
girl
suddenly
it
is
what
i
should
have
expected
to
happen
what
father
mahon
do
you
mean
it
it
is
arranged
i
know
nothing
it
may
be
coincidence
speak
no
more
of
it
you
have
the
facts
to
think
of
about
them
as
they
walked
back
in
silence
lay
the
quiet
spring
night
from
the
direction
of
the
hamlet
came
the
banging
of
a
door
then
voices
wishing
good
night
and
the
sound
of
footsteps
the
steps
passed
the
end
of
the
lane
and
died
away
again
over
the
trees
to
the
right
were
visible
the
high
twisted
chimney
of
the
old
house
where
the
terror
dwelt
two
points
then
to
remember
said
the
voice
in
the
darkness
courage
and
love
can
you
remember
maggie
bowed
her
head
again
in
answer
i
will
call
and
ask
to
see
you
as
soon
as
the
household
is
up
if
you
ca
see
me
i
shall
understand
that
things
are
going
well
or
you
can
send
out
a
note
to
me
as
for
baxter
i
shall
not
say
one
word
to
her
until
it
becomes
absolutely
necessary
and
if
if
it
becomes
necessary
i
will
wire
for
a
doctor
from
town
i
will
undertake
all
the
preliminary
arrangements
if
you
will
allow
me
ten
steps
before
the
corner
they
stopped
god
bless
you
miss
deronnais
remember
i
am
at
the
inn
if
you
need
me
iv
baxter
dined
placidly
in
bed
at
about
seven
but
she
was
more
sleepy
than
ever
when
she
had
done
she
was
rash
enough
to
drink
a
little
claret
and
water
it
always
goes
straight
to
my
head
charlotte
she
explained
well
set
the
book
no
not
that
one
the
one
bound
in
white
parchment
yes
just
so
down
here
and
turn
the
reading
lamp
so
that
i
can
read
if
i
want
to
oh
ask
miss
maggie
to
tap
at
my
door
very
softly
when
she
comes
out
from
dinner
has
she
gone
down
yet
i
think
i
heard
her
step
just
now
very
well
then
you
can
just
tell
susan
to
let
her
know
how
was
laurie
looking
charlotte
i
have
seen
him
very
well
then
that
is
all
charlotte
you
can
just
look
in
here
after
miss
maggie
and
settle
me
for
the
night
then
the
door
closed
and
baxter
instantly
began
to
doze
off
she
was
one
of
those
persons
whose
moments
between
sleeping
and
waking
especially
during
a
little
attack
of
feverishness
are
occupied
in
contemplating
a
number
of
little
vivid
pictures
of
all
kinds
that
present
themselves
to
the
mental
vision
and
she
saw
as
usual
a
quantity
of
these
made
up
of
tiny
details
of
the
day
that
was
gone
and
of
other
details
markedly
unconnected
with
it
she
saw
for
example
little
scenes
in
which
maggie
and
charlotte
and
medicine
bottles
and
chinese
faces
and
printed
pages
of
a
book
all
moved
together
in
a
sort
of
convincing
incoherence
and
she
was
just
beginning
to
lose
herself
in
the
depths
of
sleep
and
to
forget
her
firm
resolution
of
reading
another
page
or
so
of
the
book
by
her
side
when
a
little
sound
came
and
she
opened
as
she
thought
her
eyes
her
reading
lamp
cast
a
funnel
of
light
across
her
bed
and
the
rest
of
the
room
was
lit
only
by
the
fire
dancing
in
the
chimney
yet
this
was
bright
enough
she
thought
at
the
time
to
show
her
perfectly
distinctly
though
with
shadows
fleeting
across
it
her
son
face
peering
in
at
the
door
she
thought
she
said
something
but
she
was
not
sure
afterwards
at
any
rate
the
face
did
not
move
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
bore
an
expression
of
such
extraordinary
malignity
that
she
would
hardly
have
known
it
for
her
son
in
a
sudden
panic
she
raised
herself
in
bed
staring
and
as
the
shadows
came
and
went
as
she
stared
the
face
was
gone
again
baxter
drew
a
quick
breath
or
two
as
she
looked
but
there
was
nothing
yet
again
she
could
have
sworn
that
she
heard
the
faint
jar
of
the
closing
door
she
reached
out
and
put
her
hand
on
the
that
hung
down
over
her
bed
then
she
hesitated
it
was
too
ridiculous
she
told
herself
besides
charlotte
would
have
gone
to
her
room
but
the
fear
did
not
go
immediately
though
she
told
herself
again
and
again
that
it
was
just
one
of
those
little
waking
visions
that
she
knew
so
well
she
lay
back
on
the
pillow
thinking
why
they
would
have
reached
the
fish
by
now
no
she
would
tell
maggie
when
she
came
up
how
laurie
would
laugh
tomorrow
then
little
by
little
she
dozed
off
once
more
the
next
thing
of
which
she
was
aware
was
maggie
bending
over
her
asleep
auntie
dear
said
the
girl
softly
the
old
lady
murmured
something
then
she
sat
up
suddenly
no
my
dear
have
you
finished
dinner
yes
auntie
where
laurie
i
should
like
to
see
him
for
a
minute
not
tonight
auntie
you
too
tired
besides
i
think
he
gone
to
the
she
acquiesced
placidly
very
well
dearest
oh
maggie
such
a
queer
thing
happened
just
now
when
you
were
at
dinner
yes
i
thought
i
saw
laurie
look
in
just
for
an
instant
but
he
looked
awful
somehow
it
was
just
one
of
my
little
waking
visions
i
told
you
of
i
suppose
the
girl
was
silent
but
the
old
lady
saw
her
suddenly
straighten
herself
just
ask
him
whether
he
did
look
in
after
all
it
may
just
have
been
the
shadow
on
his
face
what
time
was
it
about
ten
past
eight
i
suppose
dearest
you
ask
him
wo
you
yes
auntie
i
think
i
better
lock
your
door
when
i
go
out
you
wo
fancy
such
things
then
will
you
very
well
dearest
as
you
think
best
the
old
voice
was
becoming
sleepy
again
and
maggie
stood
watching
a
moment
or
two
longer
send
charlotte
to
me
dearest
good
night
my
pet
i
too
sleepy
again
my
love
to
laurie
yes
auntie
the
old
lady
felt
the
girl
warm
lips
on
her
forehead
they
seemed
to
linger
a
little
then
baxter
lost
herself
once
more
iv
the
public
bar
of
the
wheatsheaf
inn
was
the
scene
this
evening
of
a
lively
discussion
some
thought
the
old
gentleman
arrived
that
day
from
london
to
be
a
new
kind
of
commercial
traveler
with
designs
upon
the
gardens
of
the
gentry
others
that
he
was
a
sort
of
scientific
collector
others
again
that
he
was
a
private
detective
and
since
there
was
no
evidence
at
all
good
or
bad
in
support
of
any
one
of
these
suggestions
a
very
pretty
debate
became
possible
a
silence
fell
when
his
step
was
heard
to
pass
down
the
stairs
and
out
into
the
street
and
another
half
an
hour
later
when
he
returned
then
once
more
the
discussion
began
at
ten
the
majority
of
the
men
moved
out
into
the
moonlight
to
disperse
homewards
as
the
landlord
began
to
put
away
the
glasses
and
glance
at
the
clock
overhead
the
lighted
blind
showed
where
the
mysterious
stranger
still
kept
vigil
and
over
the
way
beyond
the
still
leafless
trees
towered
up
the
twisted
chimneys
of
house
no
word
had
been
spoken
connecting
the
two
yet
one
or
two
of
the
men
glanced
across
the
way
in
vague
surmise
nearly
a
couple
of
hours
later
the
landlord
himself
came
to
the
door
to
give
the
great
nugent
himself
with
whom
he
had
been
sitting
in
the
inner
parlor
a
last
and
he
too
noticed
that
the
bedroom
window
was
still
lighted
up
he
jerked
his
finger
in
the
direction
of
it
a
late
old
party
he
said
in
an
undertone
nugent
nodded
he
was
still
a
little
flushed
with
whisky
and
with
his
previous
recountings
of
what
would
have
happened
if
his
poor
daughter
had
lived
to
marry
the
young
squire
of
his
nugent
swift
social
advancement
and
its
outward
evidences
and
of
the
hobnobbing
with
the
gentry
that
would
have
taken
place
he
looked
reflectively
across
at
the
silhouette
of
the
big
house
all
grey
and
silver
in
the
full
moon
the
landlord
followed
the
direction
of
his
eyes
and
for
some
reason
unknown
to
them
both
the
two
stood
there
silent
for
a
full
yet
there
was
nothing
exceptional
to
be
seen
immediately
before
them
across
the
road
rose
the
high
oak
paling
that
enclosed
the
lawn
on
this
side
and
the
immense
limes
that
towered
untrimmed
and
undipped
in
delicate
soaring
filigree
against
the
peacock
sky
of
night
behind
them
showed
the
chimneys
above
the
dusky
front
of
and
the
parapet
the
moon
was
not
yet
full
upon
the
house
and
the
windows
glimmered
only
here
and
there
in
lines
and
sudden
patches
where
they
caught
the
reflected
light
yet
the
two
looked
at
it
in
silence
they
had
seen
such
a
sight
fifty
times
before
for
the
landlord
and
the
other
at
least
twice
a
week
spent
such
an
evening
together
and
usually
parted
at
the
door
but
they
stood
here
on
this
evening
and
looked
all
was
as
still
as
a
spring
night
can
be
unseen
and
unheard
the
life
of
the
earth
streamed
upwards
in
twig
and
blade
and
leaf
pushing
on
to
the
miracle
of
the
prophet
jonas
to
be
revealed
in
wealth
of
color
and
scent
and
sound
a
fortnight
later
the
wind
had
fallen
the
last
doors
were
shut
and
the
two
figures
standing
here
were
as
still
as
all
else
to
neither
of
them
occurred
even
the
thinnest
shadow
of
a
suspicion
as
to
the
cause
that
held
them
here
two
plain
men
in
silence
staring
at
an
old
house
not
a
thought
of
any
hidden
life
beyond
that
of
matter
that
life
by
which
most
men
reckon
existence
for
them
this
was
but
one
more
night
such
as
they
had
known
for
half
a
century
there
was
a
moon
it
was
fine
that
was
baxter
house
this
was
the
village
street
that
was
the
sum
of
the
situation
nugent
moved
off
presently
with
a
brisk
air
bidding
his
friend
good
night
and
the
landlord
after
another
look
went
in
there
came
the
sound
of
bolts
and
bars
the
light
in
the
window
of
the
parlor
beside
the
bar
suddenly
went
out
footsteps
creaked
upstairs
a
door
shut
and
all
was
silence
half
an
hour
later
a
shadow
moved
across
the
blind
upstairs
an
arm
appeared
to
elongate
itself
then
up
went
the
blind
the
window
followed
it
and
a
bearded
face
looked
out
into
the
moonlight
behind
was
the
table
littered
with
papers
for
cathcart
laborious
even
in
the
midst
of
anxiety
had
brought
down
with
him
for
the
sunday
a
quantity
of
business
that
could
not
easily
wait
and
had
sat
there
patiently
docketing
correcting
and
writing
ever
since
his
interview
in
the
lane
nearly
five
hours
before
even
now
his
face
seemed
serene
enough
it
jerked
softly
this
way
and
that
up
the
street
and
down
again
then
once
more
settled
down
to
stare
across
the
road
at
the
grey
and
silver
pile
beyond
the
trees
yet
even
he
saw
nothing
there
beyond
what
the
landlord
had
seen
it
stood
there
uncrossed
by
lights
or
footsteps
or
sounds
keeping
its
secret
well
even
from
him
who
knew
what
it
contained
yet
to
the
watcher
the
place
was
as
sinister
as
a
prison
behind
the
solemn
walls
and
the
superficial
flash
of
the
windows
beneath
the
silence
and
the
serenity
lay
a
life
more
terrible
than
death
engaged
now
in
some
drama
of
which
he
could
not
guess
the
issue
a
conflict
was
proceeding
there
more
silent
than
the
silence
itself
two
souls
fought
for
one
against
a
foe
of
unknown
strength
and
unguessed
possibilities
the
servants
slept
apart
and
the
old
mistress
apart
yet
in
one
of
those
rooms
and
he
did
not
know
which
a
battle
was
locked
of
which
the
issue
was
more
stupendous
than
that
of
any
struggle
with
disease
yet
he
could
do
nothing
to
help
except
what
he
already
did
with
his
fingers
twisting
and
gripping
a
string
of
beads
beneath
the
such
a
battle
as
this
must
be
fought
by
picked
champions
and
since
the
priesthood
in
this
instance
could
not
help
a
girl
courage
and
love
must
take
its
place
from
the
village
above
the
hill
came
the
stroke
of
a
single
bell
a
bird
in
the
beyond
the
paling
chirped
softly
to
his
mate
then
once
more
silence
came
down
upon
the
moonlit
street
the
striped
shadows
the
tall
house
and
trees
and
the
bearded
face
watching
at
the
window
i
the
little
inner
hall
looked
very
quiet
and
familiar
as
maggie
deronnais
stood
on
the
landing
passing
through
her
last
struggle
with
herself
before
the
shock
of
battle
the
stairs
went
straight
down
with
the
old
carpet
up
and
down
which
she
had
gone
a
thousand
times
with
every
faint
patch
and
line
where
it
was
a
little
worn
at
the
edges
visible
in
the
lamplight
from
overhead
and
she
stared
at
these
standing
there
silent
in
her
white
dress
and
with
her
hair
in
great
coils
on
her
head
as
upright
as
a
lance
beneath
lay
the
little
hall
with
the
the
walls
and
a
few
miscellaneous
things
an
old
cloak
of
hers
she
used
on
rainy
days
in
the
garden
a
straw
hat
of
laurie
and
a
cap
or
two
hanging
on
the
pegs
opposite
in
front
was
the
door
to
the
outer
hall
to
the
left
that
of
the
the
house
was
perfectly
quiet
dinner
had
been
cleared
away
already
through
the
hatch
into
the
kitchen
passage
and
the
servants
quarters
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
no
sound
of
any
kind
came
from
the
not
even
the
faint
whiff
of
that
had
a
way
of
stealing
out
when
laurie
was
smoking
really
seriously
within
she
did
not
know
why
she
had
stopped
there
down
the
stairs
she
had
dined
from
a
tray
in
her
own
room
as
she
had
said
and
had
been
there
alone
ever
since
for
the
most
part
at
her
in
dead
silence
conscious
of
nothing
connected
listening
to
the
occasional
tread
of
a
maid
in
the
hall
beneath
passing
to
and
from
the
there
she
had
tried
to
face
the
ordeal
that
was
coming
the
ordeal
at
the
nature
of
which
even
now
she
only
half
guessed
and
she
had
realized
nothing
formed
no
plan
considered
no
eventuality
things
were
so
wholly
out
of
her
experience
that
she
had
no
process
whereby
to
deal
with
them
just
two
words
came
over
and
over
again
before
her
consciousness
courage
and
love
she
looked
again
at
the
door
laurie
was
there
she
said
then
she
questioned
herself
was
it
laurie
he
is
there
underneath
she
whispered
to
herself
softly
he
is
waiting
for
me
to
help
him
she
remembered
that
she
must
make
that
act
of
faith
yet
was
it
laurie
who
had
looked
in
at
his
door
well
the
door
was
locked
now
but
that
secretive
visit
seemed
to
her
terrible
what
then
did
she
believe
she
had
put
that
question
to
herself
fifty
times
and
found
no
answer
the
old
man
solution
was
clear
enough
now
he
believed
no
less
than
that
out
of
that
infinitely
mysterious
void
that
lies
beyond
the
veils
of
sense
there
had
come
a
personality
strong
malignant
degraded
and
seeking
to
degrade
seizing
upon
this
lad
soul
in
the
disguise
of
a
dead
girl
and
desiring
to
possess
it
how
fantastic
that
sounded
did
she
believe
it
she
did
not
know
then
there
was
the
solution
of
a
nervous
strain
rising
to
a
climax
of
insanity
this
was
the
answer
of
the
average
doctor
did
she
believe
that
was
that
enough
to
account
for
the
look
in
the
boy
eyes
she
did
not
know
she
understood
perfectly
that
the
fact
of
herself
living
under
conditions
of
matter
made
the
second
solution
the
more
natural
yet
that
did
not
content
her
for
her
religion
informed
her
emphatically
that
discarnate
personalities
existed
which
desired
the
ruin
of
human
souls
and
indeed
forbade
the
practices
of
spiritualism
for
this
very
reason
yet
there
was
hardly
a
catholic
she
knew
who
regarded
the
possibility
in
these
days
as
more
than
a
theoretical
one
so
she
hesitated
holding
her
judgment
in
suspense
one
thing
only
she
saw
clearly
and
that
was
that
she
must
act
as
if
she
believed
the
former
solution
she
must
treat
the
boy
as
one
obsessed
whether
indeed
he
were
so
or
not
there
was
no
other
manner
in
which
she
could
concentrate
her
force
upon
the
heart
of
the
struggle
if
there
were
no
evil
personality
in
the
affair
it
was
necessary
to
assume
one
and
still
she
waited
there
came
back
to
her
an
old
childish
memory
once
as
a
child
of
ten
she
had
had
to
undergo
a
small
operation
one
of
the
nuns
had
taken
her
to
the
doctor
house
when
she
had
understood
that
she
must
come
into
the
next
room
and
have
it
done
she
had
stopped
dead
the
nun
had
encouraged
her
leave
me
quite
alone
please
mother
just
for
one
minute
please
do
speak
i
come
in
a
minute
after
a
minute
waiting
while
they
looked
at
her
she
had
gone
forward
sat
down
in
the
chair
and
behaved
quite
perfectly
yes
she
understood
that
now
it
was
necessary
first
to
collect
forces
to
concentrate
energies
to
subdue
the
imagination
after
that
almost
anything
could
be
borne
so
she
stood
here
now
without
even
the
thought
of
flight
not
arguing
not
reassuring
herself
not
analyzing
anything
but
just
gathering
strength
screwing
the
will
tight
facing
things
and
there
was
yet
another
psychological
fact
that
astonished
her
though
she
was
only
conscious
of
it
in
a
parenthetical
kind
of
way
and
that
was
the
strength
of
her
feeling
for
laurie
himself
it
seemed
to
her
curious
when
she
considered
it
how
the
horror
of
that
which
lay
over
the
boy
seemed
like
death
itself
to
throw
out
as
on
a
clear
background
the
best
of
himself
his
figure
appeared
to
her
memory
as
wholly
good
and
sweet
the
shadows
on
his
character
seemed
absorbed
in
the
darkness
that
lay
over
him
and
towards
this
figure
she
experienced
a
sense
of
protective
love
and
energy
that
astonished
her
she
desired
with
all
her
power
to
seize
and
rescue
him
then
she
drew
a
long
steady
breath
thrust
out
her
strong
white
hand
to
see
if
the
fingers
trembled
went
down
the
stairs
and
without
knocking
opened
the
door
and
went
straight
in
closing
it
behind
her
there
was
a
screen
to
be
passed
round
she
passed
round
it
and
he
sat
there
on
the
couch
looking
at
her
ii
for
the
first
instant
she
remained
there
standing
motionless
it
was
like
a
declaration
of
war
in
one
or
two
of
her
fragmentary
rehearsals
upstairs
she
had
supposed
she
would
say
something
conventional
to
begin
with
but
the
reality
struck
conventionality
clean
out
of
the
realm
of
the
possible
her
silent
pause
there
was
as
significant
as
the
crouch
of
a
hound
and
she
perceived
that
it
was
recognized
to
be
so
by
the
other
that
was
there
there
was
in
him
that
quick
silent
alertness
she
had
expected
half
defiant
half
timid
as
of
a
fierce
beast
that
expects
a
blow
then
she
came
a
step
forward
and
sideways
to
a
chair
sat
down
in
it
with
a
swift
almost
menacing
motion
and
remained
there
still
looking
this
is
what
she
saw
there
was
the
familiar
background
the
dark
paneled
wall
the
engraving
and
the
shelf
of
books
convenient
to
the
hand
the
fire
was
on
her
right
and
the
couch
opposite
upon
the
couch
sat
the
figure
of
the
boy
she
knew
so
well
he
was
in
the
same
suit
in
which
he
had
traveled
he
had
not
even
changed
his
shoes
they
were
splashed
a
little
with
london
mud
these
things
she
noticed
in
the
minutes
that
followed
though
she
kept
her
eyes
upon
his
face
the
face
itself
was
beyond
her
power
of
analysis
line
for
line
it
was
laurie
features
mouth
eyes
and
hair
yet
its
signification
was
not
laurie
one
that
was
akin
looked
at
her
from
out
of
those
windows
of
the
soul
scrutinized
her
cautiously
questioningly
and
suspiciously
it
was
the
face
of
an
enemy
who
waits
and
she
sat
and
looked
at
it
a
full
minute
must
have
passed
before
she
spoke
the
face
had
dropped
its
eyes
after
the
first
long
look
as
if
in
a
kind
of
relaxation
and
remained
motionless
staring
at
the
fire
in
a
sort
of
dejection
yet
beneath
she
perceived
plainly
there
was
the
same
alert
hostility
and
when
she
spoke
the
eyes
rose
again
with
a
quick
furtive
attentiveness
the
beast
was
soothed
but
not
yet
reassured
laurie
she
said
the
lips
moved
a
little
in
answer
then
again
the
face
glanced
down
sideways
at
the
fire
the
hands
dangled
almost
helplessly
between
the
knees
there
was
an
appearance
of
weakness
about
the
attitude
that
astonished
and
encouraged
her
it
appeared
as
if
matters
were
not
yet
consummated
yet
she
had
a
sense
of
nausea
at
the
sight
laurie
she
said
again
suddenly
again
the
lips
moved
as
if
speaking
rapidly
and
the
eyes
looked
up
at
her
quick
and
suspicious
well
said
the
mouth
and
still
the
hands
dangled
laurie
she
said
steadily
bending
all
her
will
at
the
words
you
very
unwell
do
you
understand
that
again
the
noiseless
gabbling
of
the
lips
and
again
a
little
commonplace
sentence
i
all
right
his
voice
was
unnatural
a
little
hoarse
and
quite
toneless
it
was
as
a
voice
from
behind
a
mask
no
said
maggie
carefully
you
not
all
right
listen
laurie
i
tell
you
you
all
wrong
and
i
come
to
help
you
as
well
as
i
can
will
you
do
your
best
i
speaking
to
laurie
to
every
time
he
answered
the
lips
flickered
first
as
in
rapid
conversation
as
of
a
man
seen
talking
through
a
window
but
this
time
he
stammered
a
little
over
his
vowels
i
i
i
all
right
maggie
leaned
forward
her
hands
clasped
tightly
and
her
eyes
fixed
steadily
on
that
baffling
face
laurie
it
you
i
speaking
to
can
you
hear
me
do
understand
again
the
eyes
rose
quick
and
suspicious
and
her
hands
knit
yet
more
closely
together
as
she
fought
down
the
rising
nausea
she
drew
a
long
breath
first
then
she
delivered
a
little
speech
which
she
had
half
rehearsed
upstairs
as
she
spoke
he
looked
at
her
again
laurie
she
said
i
want
you
to
listen
to
me
very
carefully
and
to
trust
me
i
know
what
is
the
matter
with
you
and
i
think
you
know
too
you
ca
fight
fight
him
by
yourself
just
hold
on
as
tightly
as
you
can
to
me
with
your
mind
i
mean
do
you
understand
for
a
moment
she
thought
that
he
perceived
something
of
what
she
meant
he
looked
at
her
so
earnestly
with
those
odd
questioning
eyes
then
he
jerked
ever
so
slightly
as
if
some
string
had
been
suddenly
pulled
and
glanced
down
again
at
the
fire
i
i
i
all
right
he
said
it
was
horrible
to
see
that
motionlessness
of
body
he
sat
there
as
he
had
probably
sat
since
entering
the
room
his
eyes
moved
but
scarcely
his
head
and
his
hands
hung
down
helplessly
laurie
attend
she
began
again
then
she
broke
off
have
you
prayed
laurie
do
you
understand
what
has
happened
to
you
you
are
really
ill
at
least
not
exactly
but
again
those
eyes
lifted
looked
and
dropped
again
it
was
piteous
for
the
instant
the
sense
of
nausea
vanished
swallowed
up
in
emotion
why
why
he
was
there
all
the
while
laurie
dear
laurie
with
one
motion
swift
and
impetuous
she
had
thrown
herself
forward
on
to
her
knees
and
clasped
at
the
hanging
hands
laurie
laurie
she
cried
you
have
prayed
you
been
playing
and
the
machinery
has
caught
you
but
it
is
too
late
oh
god
it
not
too
late
pray
with
me
say
the
our
father
again
slowly
the
eyes
moved
round
he
had
started
ever
so
little
at
her
rush
and
the
seizing
of
his
hands
and
now
she
felt
those
hands
moving
weakly
in
her
own
as
of
a
sleeping
child
who
tries
to
detach
himself
from
his
mother
arms
i
i
i
all
she
grasped
his
hands
more
fiercely
staring
straight
up
into
those
strange
piteous
eyes
that
revealed
so
little
except
formless
commotion
and
uneasiness
say
the
our
father
with
me
father
then
his
hands
tore
back
with
a
movement
as
fierce
as
her
own
and
the
eyes
blazed
with
an
unreal
light
she
still
clung
to
his
wrists
looking
up
struck
with
a
paralysis
of
fear
at
the
change
and
the
furious
hostility
that
flamed
up
in
the
face
the
lips
writhed
back
half
snarling
half
smiling
let
go
let
go
he
hissed
at
her
what
are
you
the
our
father
laurie
the
our
he
wrenched
himself
backwards
striking
her
under
the
chin
with
his
knee
the
couch
slid
backwards
a
foot
against
the
wall
and
he
was
on
his
feet
she
remained
shocked
looking
up
at
the
dully
flushed
face
that
glared
down
on
her
laurie
laurie
do
you
understand
say
one
prayer
how
dare
you
he
whispered
how
dare
you
she
stood
up
suddenly
wrenching
her
will
back
to
her
breath
still
came
quick
and
panting
and
she
waited
until
once
more
she
breathed
naturally
and
all
the
while
he
stood
looking
down
at
her
with
eyes
of
extraordinary
malevolence
well
will
you
sit
quietly
and
listen
she
said
will
you
do
that
still
he
stared
at
her
with
lips
closed
breathing
rapidly
through
his
nostrils
with
a
sudden
movement
she
turned
and
went
to
her
chair
sat
down
and
waited
he
still
watched
her
then
with
his
eyes
on
her
with
movements
as
of
a
man
in
the
act
of
wheeled
out
the
sofa
to
its
place
and
sat
down
she
waited
till
the
tension
of
his
figure
seemed
to
relax
again
till
the
quick
glances
at
her
from
beneath
drooping
eyelids
ceased
and
once
more
he
settled
down
with
dangling
hands
to
look
at
the
fire
then
she
began
again
quietly
and
decisively
your
mother
is
well
she
said
no
just
listen
quietly
what
is
going
to
happen
tomorrow
i
speaking
to
laurie
to
do
you
understand
i
all
right
he
said
dully
she
disregarded
it
i
want
to
help
you
laurie
you
know
that
do
you
i
maggie
deronnais
you
remember
yes
maggie
deronnais
said
the
boy
staring
at
the
fire
yes
i
maggie
you
trust
me
do
you
laurie
you
can
believe
what
i
say
well
i
want
you
to
fight
too
you
and
i
together
will
you
let
me
do
what
i
can
again
the
eyes
rose
with
that
odd
questioning
look
maggie
thought
she
perceived
something
else
there
too
she
gathered
her
forces
quietly
in
silence
an
instant
or
two
feeling
her
heart
quicken
like
the
pulse
of
a
moving
engine
then
she
sprang
to
her
feet
listen
then
in
the
name
of
jesus
of
nazareth
he
recoiled
violently
with
a
movement
so
fierce
that
the
words
died
on
her
lips
for
one
moment
she
thought
he
was
going
to
spring
and
again
he
was
on
his
feet
snarling
there
was
silence
for
an
interminable
instant
then
a
stream
of
words
scorching
and
ferocious
snarled
at
her
like
the
furious
growling
of
a
dog
a
string
of
blasphemies
and
filth
just
so
much
she
understood
yet
she
held
her
ground
unable
to
speak
conscious
of
the
torrent
of
language
that
swirled
against
her
from
that
suffused
face
opposite
yet
not
understanding
a
tenth
part
of
what
she
heard
in
the
name
of
on
the
instant
the
words
ceased
but
so
overpowering
was
the
venom
and
malice
of
the
silence
that
followed
that
again
she
was
silent
perceiving
that
the
utmost
she
could
do
was
to
hold
her
ground
so
the
two
stood
if
the
words
were
horrible
to
hear
the
silence
was
more
horrible
a
thousand
times
it
was
as
when
a
man
faces
the
suddenly
opened
door
of
a
furnace
and
sees
the
white
cavern
within
he
was
the
first
to
speak
you
had
better
take
care
he
said
iii
she
scarcely
knew
how
it
was
that
she
found
herself
again
in
her
chair
with
the
figure
seated
opposite
it
seemed
that
the
direct
assault
was
useless
and
indeed
she
was
no
longer
capable
of
making
it
the
nausea
had
returned
and
with
it
a
sensation
of
weakness
her
knees
still
were
lax
and
useless
and
her
hand
as
she
turned
it
on
the
shook
violently
yet
she
had
a
curious
sense
of
irresponsibility
there
was
no
longer
any
terror
nothing
but
an
overpowering
weakness
of
reaction
she
sat
back
in
silence
for
some
minutes
looking
now
at
the
fire
too
now
at
the
figure
opposite
noticing
however
that
the
helplessness
seemed
gone
his
hands
dangled
no
longer
he
sat
upright
his
hands
clasped
yet
with
a
curious
look
of
stiffness
and
unnaturalness
once
more
she
began
deliberately
to
attempt
to
gather
her
forces
but
the
will
it
appeared
had
lost
its
nervous
grasp
of
the
faculties
it
had
no
longer
that
quick
grip
and
command
with
which
she
had
begun
passivity
rather
than
activity
seemed
her
strength
then
suddenly
and
as
it
appeared
inevitably
without
movement
or
sound
she
began
internally
to
pray
closing
her
eyes
careless
and
indeed
unfearing
it
seemed
her
one
hope
and
behind
the
steady
movement
of
her
will
sufficient
at
least
to
elicit
acts
of
petition
her
intellect
observed
a
thousand
images
and
thoughts
she
perceived
the
silence
of
the
house
and
of
the
breathless
spring
night
outside
she
considered
cathcart
in
the
inn
across
the
road
baxter
upstairs
she
contemplated
the
future
as
it
would
be
on
the
morrow
easter
day
was
it
not
the
past
and
scarcely
at
all
the
present
she
relinquished
all
plans
all
intentions
and
hopes
she
leaned
simply
upon
the
supernatural
like
a
tired
child
and
looked
at
pictures
in
remembering
it
all
afterwards
she
recalled
to
herself
the
fact
that
this
process
of
prayer
seemed
strangely
tranquil
that
there
had
been
in
her
a
consciousness
of
rest
and
recuperation
as
marked
as
that
which
a
traveler
feels
who
turns
into
a
lighted
house
from
a
stormy
night
the
presence
of
that
other
in
the
room
was
not
even
an
interruption
the
nervous
force
that
the
other
had
generated
just
now
seemed
harmless
and
ineffective
for
a
time
at
least
that
was
so
but
there
came
a
moment
when
it
appeared
as
if
her
almost
mechanical
and
rhythmical
action
of
internal
effort
began
to
grip
something
it
was
as
when
an
engine
after
running
free
clenches
itself
again
upon
some
wheel
or
cog
the
moment
she
was
aware
of
this
she
opened
her
eyes
and
saw
that
the
other
was
looking
straight
at
her
intently
and
questioningly
and
in
that
moment
she
perceived
for
the
first
time
that
her
conflict
lay
not
externally
as
she
had
thought
but
in
some
interior
region
of
which
she
was
wholly
ignorant
it
was
not
by
word
or
action
but
by
something
else
which
she
only
half
understood
that
she
was
to
struggle
she
closed
her
eyes
again
with
quite
a
new
kind
of
determination
it
was
not
that
she
needed
but
a
steady
interior
concentration
of
forces
she
began
again
that
resolute
wordless
play
of
the
will
dismissing
with
a
series
of
efforts
the
intellectual
images
of
thought
that
play
of
the
will
which
it
seemed
had
affected
the
boy
opposite
in
a
new
way
she
had
no
idea
of
what
the
crisis
would
be
or
how
it
would
come
she
only
saw
that
she
had
struck
upon
a
new
path
that
led
somewhere
she
must
follow
it
some
little
sound
roused
her
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
up
he
had
shifted
his
position
and
for
a
moment
her
heart
leapt
with
hope
for
he
sat
now
leaning
forward
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
head
in
his
hands
and
in
the
shaded
lamplight
it
seemed
that
he
was
shaking
she
too
moved
and
the
rustle
of
her
dress
seemed
to
reach
him
he
glanced
up
and
before
he
dropped
his
head
again
she
caught
a
clear
sight
of
his
face
he
was
laughing
silently
and
overpoweringly
without
a
sound
for
a
moment
the
nausea
seized
her
so
fiercely
that
she
gasped
catching
at
her
throat
and
she
stared
at
that
bowed
head
and
shaking
shoulders
with
a
horror
that
she
had
not
felt
before
the
laughter
was
worse
than
all
and
it
was
a
little
while
before
she
perceived
its
unreality
it
was
like
a
laughing
machine
and
the
silence
of
it
gave
it
a
peculiar
touch
she
wrestled
with
herself
driving
down
the
despair
that
was
on
her
courage
and
love
again
she
leaned
back
without
speaking
closing
her
eyes
to
shut
out
the
terror
and
began
desperately
and
resolutely
to
bend
her
will
again
to
the
task
again
a
little
sound
disturbed
her
once
more
he
had
shifted
his
position
and
was
looking
straight
at
her
with
a
curious
air
of
detached
interest
his
face
looked
almost
natural
though
it
was
still
flushed
with
that
forced
laughter
but
the
mirth
itself
was
gone
then
he
spoke
abruptly
and
sharply
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
speaks
to
a
tiresome
child
and
a
little
conversation
followed
in
which
she
found
herself
taking
a
part
as
in
an
unnatural
dream
you
had
better
take
care
he
said
i
am
not
afraid
well
i
have
warned
you
it
is
at
your
own
risk
what
are
you
doing
i
am
praying
i
thought
so
well
you
had
better
take
care
she
nodded
at
him
closed
her
eyes
once
more
with
new
confidence
and
set
to
work
after
that
a
series
of
little
scenes
followed
of
which
a
few
days
later
she
could
only
give
a
disconnected
account
she
had
heard
the
locking
of
the
front
door
a
long
while
ago
and
she
knew
that
the
household
was
gone
to
bed
it
was
then
that
she
realized
how
long
the
struggle
would
be
but
the
next
incident
was
marked
in
her
memory
by
her
hearing
the
tall
clock
in
the
silent
hall
outside
beat
one
it
was
immediately
after
this
that
he
spoke
once
more
i
have
stood
it
long
enough
he
said
in
that
same
abrupt
manner
she
opened
her
eyes
you
are
still
praying
he
said
she
nodded
he
got
up
without
a
word
and
came
over
to
her
leaning
forward
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
to
peer
into
her
face
again
to
her
astonishment
she
was
not
terrified
she
just
waited
looking
narrowly
at
the
strange
person
who
looked
through
laurie
eyes
and
spoke
through
his
mouth
it
was
all
as
unreal
as
a
fantastic
dream
it
seemed
like
some
abominable
game
or
drama
that
had
to
be
gone
through
and
you
mean
to
go
on
praying
yes
do
you
think
it
the
slightest
use
yes
he
smiled
unnaturally
as
if
the
muscles
of
his
mouth
were
not
perfectly
obedient
well
i
have
warned
you
he
said
then
he
turned
went
back
to
his
couch
and
this
time
lay
down
on
it
flat
turning
over
on
his
side
away
from
her
as
if
to
sleep
he
settled
himself
there
like
a
dog
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
then
closed
her
eyes
and
began
again
five
minutes
later
she
understood
the
first
symptom
of
which
she
was
aware
was
a
powerlessness
to
formulate
her
prayers
up
to
that
point
she
had
leaned
as
has
been
said
on
an
enormous
power
external
to
herself
yet
approached
by
an
interior
way
now
it
required
an
effort
of
the
will
to
hold
to
that
power
at
all
in
terms
of
space
let
it
be
said
that
she
had
rested
like
a
child
in
the
dark
upon
something
that
sustained
her
now
she
was
aware
that
it
no
longer
sustained
her
but
that
it
needed
a
strong
continuous
effort
to
apprehend
it
at
all
there
was
still
the
dark
about
her
but
it
was
of
a
different
quality
it
can
not
be
expressed
otherwise
it
was
as
the
darkness
of
an
unknown
gulf
compared
to
the
darkness
of
a
familiar
room
it
was
of
such
a
nature
that
space
and
form
seemed
meaningless
the
next
symptom
was
a
sense
of
terror
comparable
only
to
that
which
she
had
succeeded
in
crushing
down
as
she
stood
on
the
stairs
four
or
five
hours
before
that
however
had
been
external
to
her
she
had
entered
it
now
it
had
entered
her
and
lay
heavy
as
pitch
upon
the
very
springs
of
her
interior
life
it
was
terror
of
something
to
come
that
which
it
heralded
was
not
yet
come
but
it
was
approaching
the
third
symptom
was
the
approach
itself
swift
and
silent
like
the
running
of
a
bear
so
swift
that
it
was
upon
her
through
the
dark
before
she
could
stir
or
act
it
came
upon
her
in
a
flash
at
the
last
and
she
understood
the
whole
secret
it
is
possible
only
to
describe
it
as
afterwards
she
described
it
herself
the
powerlessness
and
the
terror
were
no
more
than
the
effect
of
its
approach
the
thing
itself
was
the
center
of
that
realm
of
being
from
which
it
came
she
had
no
previous
conception
she
had
known
evil
only
in
its
effects
in
sins
of
herself
and
others
known
it
as
a
man
passing
through
a
hospital
ward
sees
flushed
or
pale
faces
or
bandaged
wounds
now
she
caught
some
glimpse
of
its
essence
in
the
atmosphere
of
this
thing
that
was
upon
her
as
aches
and
pains
are
to
death
so
were
sins
to
this
personality
symptoms
premonitions
causes
but
not
itself
and
she
was
aware
that
the
thing
had
come
from
a
spiritual
distance
so
unthinkable
and
immeasurable
that
the
very
word
distance
meant
little
of
the
presence
itself
and
its
mode
she
could
use
nothing
better
than
metaphors
but
those
to
whom
she
spoke
were
given
to
understand
that
it
was
not
this
or
that
faculty
of
her
being
that
so
to
speak
pushed
against
it
but
that
her
entire
being
was
saturated
so
entirely
that
it
was
but
just
possible
to
distinguish
her
inmost
self
from
it
the
understanding
no
longer
moved
the
emotions
no
longer
rebelled
memory
simply
ceased
yet
through
the
worst
there
remained
one
minute
infinitesimally
small
spark
of
identity
that
maintained
i
am
i
and
i
am
not
that
there
was
no
analysis
or
consideration
scarcely
even
a
sense
of
disgust
in
fact
for
a
while
there
was
a
period
when
to
that
tiny
spot
of
identity
it
appeared
that
it
would
be
an
incalculable
relief
to
cease
from
striving
and
to
let
self
itself
be
merged
in
that
personality
so
amazingly
strong
and
compelling
that
had
precipitated
itself
upon
the
rest
relief
certainly
for
though
emotion
as
most
men
know
it
was
crushed
out
that
emotion
stirred
by
human
love
or
hatred
there
remained
an
instinct
which
strove
which
by
one
long
continuous
tension
maintained
itself
in
being
for
the
malignity
of
the
thing
was
overwhelming
it
was
not
mere
pressure
it
had
a
character
of
its
own
for
which
the
girl
afterwards
had
no
words
she
could
only
say
that
so
far
from
being
negation
or
emptiness
or
it
had
an
air
hot
as
flame
black
as
pitch
and
hard
as
iron
that
then
was
the
situation
for
a
time
which
she
could
only
afterwards
reckon
by
guesswork
there
was
no
development
or
movement
no
measurable
incidents
there
was
but
the
state
that
remained
poised
below
all
those
comparatively
superficial
faculties
with
which
men
in
general
carry
on
their
affairs
that
state
in
which
two
personalities
faced
one
another
welded
together
in
a
grip
that
lay
on
the
very
brink
of
fusion
i
the
cocks
were
crowing
from
the
yards
behind
the
village
when
maggie
opened
her
eyes
clear
shrill
music
answered
from
the
hill
as
by
their
echoes
and
the
yews
outside
were
alive
with
the
of
the
sparrows
she
lay
there
quite
quietly
watching
under
her
tired
eyelids
through
the
still
unshuttered
windows
the
splendid
glow
seen
behind
the
twisted
stems
in
front
and
the
slender
fairy
forest
of
birches
on
the
further
side
of
the
garden
immediately
outside
the
window
lay
the
path
deep
in
the
beyond
and
the
wet
lawn
glistening
in
the
strange
mystical
light
of
morning
she
had
no
need
to
remember
or
consider
she
knew
every
step
and
process
of
the
night
that
was
laurie
who
lay
opposite
in
a
deep
sleep
his
head
on
his
arm
breathing
deeply
and
regularly
and
this
was
the
little
where
she
had
seen
the
cigarettes
laid
ready
against
his
coming
last
night
there
was
still
a
log
just
alight
on
the
hearth
she
noticed
she
got
out
of
her
chair
softly
and
stiffly
for
she
felt
intolerably
languid
and
tired
besides
she
must
not
disturb
the
boy
so
she
went
down
on
her
knees
and
with
infinite
craft
picked
out
a
coal
or
two
from
the
fender
and
dropped
them
neatly
into
the
core
of
that
still
smoldered
but
a
fragment
of
wood
detached
itself
and
fell
with
a
sharp
sound
and
she
knew
even
without
turning
her
head
that
the
boy
had
awakened
there
was
a
faint
inarticulate
murmur
a
rustle
and
a
long
sigh
then
she
turned
round
laurie
was
lying
on
his
back
his
arms
clasped
behind
his
head
looking
at
her
with
a
quiet
meditative
air
he
appeared
no
more
astonished
or
perplexed
than
herself
he
was
a
little
and
tired
in
the
light
of
dawn
but
his
eyes
were
bright
and
sure
she
rose
from
her
knees
again
still
silent
and
stood
looking
down
on
him
and
he
looked
back
at
her
there
was
no
need
of
speech
it
was
one
of
those
moments
in
which
one
does
not
even
say
that
there
are
no
words
to
use
one
just
regards
the
thing
like
a
stretch
of
open
country
it
is
contemplation
not
comment
that
is
needed
her
eyes
wandered
away
presently
with
the
same
tranquility
to
the
brightening
garden
outside
and
her
slowly
awakening
mind
expanding
within
sent
up
a
little
scrap
of
quotation
to
be
answered
while
it
was
yet
early
there
came
to
the
sepulcher
how
did
it
run
mary
then
she
spoke
it
is
easter
day
laurie
the
boy
nodded
gently
and
she
saw
his
eyes
slowly
closing
once
more
he
was
not
yet
half
awake
so
she
went
past
him
on
tiptoe
to
the
window
turned
the
handle
and
opened
the
white
tall
door
a
gush
of
air
sweet
as
wine
laden
with
the
smell
of
dew
and
spring
flowers
and
wet
lawns
stole
in
to
meet
her
and
a
blackbird
in
the
shrubbery
across
the
garden
broke
into
song
interrupted
himself
chattered
melodiously
and
scurried
out
to
vanish
in
a
long
curve
behind
the
yews
the
very
world
itself
of
beast
and
bird
was
still
but
half
awake
and
from
the
hamlet
outside
the
fence
beyond
the
trees
rose
as
yet
no
skein
of
smoke
and
no
sound
of
feet
upon
the
cobbles
for
the
time
no
future
presented
itself
to
her
the
minutes
that
passed
were
enough
she
regarded
indeed
the
fact
of
the
old
man
asleep
in
the
inn
of
the
old
lady
upstairs
but
she
rehearsed
nothing
of
what
should
be
said
to
them
by
and
by
she
did
not
even
think
of
the
hour
or
whether
she
should
go
to
bed
presently
for
a
while
she
traced
no
sequence
of
thought
she
scarcely
gave
a
glance
at
what
was
past
it
was
the
present
only
that
absorbed
her
and
even
of
the
present
not
more
than
a
fraction
lay
before
her
attention
the
wet
lawn
the
brightening
east
the
cool
air
those
with
the
joy
that
had
come
with
the
morning
were
enough
again
came
the
long
sigh
behind
her
and
a
moment
afterwards
there
was
a
step
upon
the
floor
and
laurie
himself
stood
by
her
she
glanced
at
him
sideways
wondering
for
an
instant
whether
his
mood
was
as
hers
and
his
grave
tired
boyish
face
was
answer
enough
he
met
her
eyes
and
then
again
let
his
own
stray
out
to
the
garden
he
was
the
first
to
speak
maggie
he
said
i
think
we
had
best
never
speak
of
this
again
to
one
another
she
nodded
but
he
went
on
i
understand
very
little
i
wish
to
understand
no
more
i
shall
ask
no
questions
and
nothing
need
be
said
to
anybody
you
agree
i
agree
perfectly
she
said
and
not
a
word
to
my
mother
of
course
of
course
not
the
two
were
silent
again
and
now
reality
or
rather
the
faculties
of
memory
and
consideration
by
which
reality
is
apprehended
were
once
more
coming
back
to
the
girl
and
beginning
to
stir
in
her
mind
she
began
gently
now
and
without
perturbation
to
recall
what
had
passed
the
long
crescendo
of
the
previous
months
the
gathering
mutter
of
the
spiritual
storm
that
had
burst
last
night
even
the
roar
and
flare
of
the
storm
itself
and
the
mad
instinctive
fight
for
the
conscious
life
and
identity
of
herself
through
which
she
had
struggled
and
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
the
storm
like
others
in
the
material
plane
had
washed
things
clean
again
and
discharged
an
oppression
of
which
she
had
been
but
half
conscious
neither
was
it
herself
alone
who
had
emerged
into
this
clear
shining
after
rain
but
the
boy
that
stood
by
her
seemed
to
her
to
share
in
her
joy
they
stood
here
together
now
in
a
spiritual
garden
of
which
this
lovely
morning
was
no
more
than
a
clumsy
translation
into
another
tongue
there
stirred
an
air
about
them
which
was
as
wine
to
the
soul
a
coolness
and
clearness
that
was
beyond
thought
in
a
radiance
that
shone
through
all
that
was
bathed
within
it
as
sunlight
that
filtered
through
water
she
perceived
then
that
the
experience
had
been
an
initiation
for
them
both
that
here
they
stood
one
by
the
other
each
transparent
to
the
other
or
at
least
he
transparent
to
her
and
she
wondered
not
whether
he
would
see
it
as
she
did
for
of
that
she
was
confident
but
when
for
this
space
of
silence
she
perceived
him
through
and
through
and
understood
that
perception
was
everything
she
saw
the
flaws
in
him
as
plainly
as
in
herself
the
cracks
in
the
crystal
yet
these
did
not
matter
for
the
crystal
was
crystal
so
she
waited
confident
until
he
should
understand
it
too
but
that
is
only
one
fraction
of
what
is
in
my
mind
he
broke
off
then
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
opened
her
eyes
just
now
her
heart
began
to
beat
that
which
had
lain
hidden
for
so
long
that
which
she
had
crushed
down
under
stone
and
seal
and
bidden
lie
still
yet
that
which
had
held
her
resolute
all
unknown
to
herself
through
the
night
that
was
gone
once
more
asserted
itself
and
waited
for
liberation
yet
how
dare
i
began
laurie
again
she
glanced
at
him
terrified
lest
that
which
was
in
her
heart
should
declare
itself
too
plainly
by
eyes
and
lips
and
she
saw
how
he
still
looked
across
the
garden
yet
seeing
nothing
but
his
own
thought
written
there
against
the
glory
of
sky
and
leaf
and
grass
his
face
caught
the
splendor
from
the
east
and
she
saw
in
it
the
lines
that
would
tell
always
of
the
anguish
through
which
he
was
come
and
again
the
terror
in
her
heart
leapt
to
the
other
side
in
spite
of
her
confidence
and
bade
her
fear
lest
through
some
mistake
some
conventional
shame
he
should
say
no
more
then
he
turned
his
troubled
eyes
and
looked
her
in
the
face
and
as
he
looked
the
trouble
cleared
why
maggie
he
said
the
worst
of
it
all
is
said
maggie
four
months
later
to
a
very
patient
female
friend
who
adored
her
and
was
her
just
then
the
worst
of
it
is
that
i
not
in
the
least
sure
of
what
it
is
that
i
believe
even
now
tell
me
dear
said
the
girl
the
two
were
sitting
out
in
a
delightfully
contrived
retreat
cut
out
at
the
lower
end
of
the
double
hedge
above
them
and
on
two
sides
rose
masses
of
august
greenery
hazel
and
beech
as
close
as
the
roof
and
walls
of
a
the
long
path
ran
in
green
gloom
up
to
the
old
brick
steps
beneath
the
yews
and
before
the
two
girls
rested
the
pleasant
apparatus
of
tea
silver
china
and
damask
all
the
more
delightful
from
its
barbaric
contrast
with
its
surroundings
maggie
looked
marvelously
well
considering
the
nervous
strain
that
had
come
upon
her
about
she
had
collapsed
altogether
it
seemed
in
easter
week
itself
and
had
been
for
a
long
rest
one
at
her
own
dear
french
convent
until
a
week
ago
being
entirely
forbidden
by
the
nuns
to
speak
of
her
experiences
at
all
so
soon
as
they
had
heard
the
rough
outline
baxter
had
spent
the
time
in
rather
melancholy
travel
on
the
continent
and
was
coming
back
this
evening
it
seems
to
me
now
exactly
like
a
very
bad
dream
said
maggie
pensively
beginning
to
measure
in
the
tea
with
a
small
silver
scoop
oh
mabel
may
i
tell
you
exactly
what
is
in
my
mind
and
then
we
wo
talk
of
it
any
more
at
all
oh
do
said
the
girl
with
a
little
comfortable
movement
when
the
tea
had
been
poured
out
and
the
plates
set
ready
to
hand
maggie
began
it
seems
perfectly
dreadful
of
me
to
have
any
doubts
at
all
after
all
this
but
but
you
do
know
how
queer
it
seems
there
a
kind
of
thick
hedge
she
waved
a
hand
illustratively
to
the
hazels
beside
her
a
kind
of
thick
hedge
between
me
and
easter
i
suppose
it
the
illness
the
nuns
tell
me
so
well
it
like
that
i
can
see
myself
and
laurie
and
cathcart
and
all
the
rest
of
them
like
figures
moving
beyond
and
they
all
seem
to
me
to
be
behaving
rather
madly
as
if
they
saw
something
that
i
ca
see
oh
it
hopeless
well
the
first
theory
i
have
is
that
these
little
figures
myself
included
really
see
something
that
i
ca
now
that
there
really
was
something
or
somebody
which
makes
them
dance
about
like
that
yes
that
not
grammar
but
you
understand
do
you
well
i
come
back
to
that
presently
and
my
next
theory
is
this
is
this
maggie
sipped
her
tea
meditatively
my
next
theory
is
that
the
whole
thing
was
simple
imagination
or
rather
imagination
acting
upon
a
few
little
facts
and
coincidences
and
perhaps
a
little
fraud
too
do
you
know
the
way
if
you
jealous
or
irritable
the
way
in
which
everything
seems
to
fit
in
every
single
word
the
person
you
suspicious
of
utters
all
fits
in
and
corroborates
your
idea
it
is
mere
imagination
you
have
real
facts
of
a
kind
but
what
the
matter
is
that
you
choose
to
take
the
facts
in
one
way
and
not
another
you
select
and
arrange
until
the
thing
is
perfectly
convincing
and
yet
you
know
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
it
simply
a
lie
oh
i
ca
explain
all
the
things
certainly
i
ca
explain
for
instance
the
pencil
affair
when
it
stood
up
on
end
before
laurie
eyes
that
is
if
it
did
really
stand
up
at
all
he
says
himself
that
the
whole
thing
seems
rather
dim
now
as
if
he
had
seen
it
in
a
very
vivid
dream
have
one
of
these
sugar
things
then
there
are
the
appearances
laurie
saw
and
the
extraordinary
effect
they
finally
had
upon
him
oh
yes
at
the
time
on
the
night
of
easter
eve
i
mean
i
was
absolutely
certain
that
the
thing
was
real
that
he
was
actually
obsessed
that
the
thing
the
personality
i
mean
came
at
me
instead
and
that
somehow
i
won
cathcart
tells
me
i
right
well
i
come
to
that
presently
but
if
it
happen
i
certainly
ca
explain
what
did
but
there
are
a
good
many
things
one
ca
explain
and
yet
one
does
instantly
rush
to
the
conclusion
that
they
done
by
the
devil
people
say
that
we
know
very
little
indeed
about
the
inner
working
of
our
own
selves
instinct
for
instance
we
know
nothing
about
that
except
that
it
is
so
experience
is
only
rather
a
clumsy
phrase
a
piece
of
paper
gummed
up
to
cover
a
crack
in
the
wall
and
that
brings
me
to
my
third
theory
maggie
poured
out
for
herself
a
second
cup
of
tea
my
third
theory
i
rather
vague
about
altogether
and
yet
i
see
quite
well
that
it
may
be
the
true
one
please
do
interrupt
till
i
quite
done
we
got
in
us
certain
powers
that
we
do
understand
at
all
for
instance
there
there
not
a
shadow
of
doubt
that
that
is
so
i
can
sit
here
and
send
you
a
message
of
what
thinking
about
oh
vaguely
of
course
it
another
form
of
what
we
mean
by
sympathy
and
intuition
well
you
know
some
people
think
that
haunted
houses
can
be
explained
by
this
when
the
murder
is
going
on
the
murderer
and
the
murdered
person
are
probably
fearfully
excited
anger
fear
and
so
on
that
means
that
their
whole
being
is
stirred
up
right
to
the
bottom
and
that
their
hidden
powers
are
frightfully
active
well
the
idea
is
that
these
hidden
powers
are
almost
like
acids
or
gas
hudson
tells
us
all
about
that
and
that
they
can
actually
stamp
themselves
upon
the
room
to
such
a
degree
that
when
a
sympathetic
person
comes
in
years
afterwards
perhaps
he
sees
the
whole
thing
just
as
it
happened
it
acts
upon
his
mind
first
of
course
and
then
outwards
through
the
senses
just
the
reverse
order
to
that
in
which
we
generally
see
things
well
that
only
an
illustration
now
my
idea
is
this
how
do
we
know
whether
all
the
things
that
happened
from
the
pencil
and
the
rappings
and
the
automatic
writing
right
up
to
the
appearances
laurie
saw
were
not
just
the
result
of
these
inner
powers
look
here
when
one
person
projects
his
thought
to
another
it
arrives
generally
like
a
very
faint
phantom
of
the
thing
he
thinking
about
if
thinking
of
the
ace
of
hearts
you
see
a
white
rectangle
with
a
red
spot
in
the
middle
see
well
multiply
all
that
a
hundred
times
and
one
can
just
see
how
it
might
be
possible
that
the
thought
of
of
vincent
and
laurie
together
might
produce
a
kind
of
unreal
phantom
that
could
even
be
touched
perhaps
oh
i
do
know
maggie
paused
the
girl
at
her
side
gave
an
encouraging
murmur
well
that
about
all
said
maggie
slowly
but
you
have
why
how
stupid
yes
the
first
theory
now
that
just
shows
how
unreal
it
is
to
me
now
i
forgotten
it
well
the
first
theory
my
dear
brethren
divides
itself
into
two
heads
first
the
theory
of
the
spiritualists
secondly
the
theory
of
cathcart
he
a
dear
mabel
even
though
i
do
believe
one
word
he
says
well
the
spiritualist
theory
seems
to
me
simple
rot
vincent
stapleton
and
the
rest
really
think
that
the
souls
of
people
actually
come
back
and
do
these
things
that
it
was
really
and
truly
poor
dear
amy
nugent
who
led
laurie
such
a
dance
i
quite
quite
certain
that
that
not
true
whatever
else
is
yes
i
come
to
the
coincidences
presently
but
how
can
it
possibly
be
that
amy
should
come
back
and
do
these
things
and
hurt
laurie
so
horribly
why
she
could
if
she
tried
my
dear
to
be
quite
frank
she
was
a
very
common
little
thing
and
besides
she
would
have
hurt
a
hair
of
his
head
now
for
mr
cathcart
there
was
a
long
pause
a
small
cat
stepped
out
suddenly
from
the
hazel
tangle
behind
and
eyed
the
two
girls
then
quite
noiselessly
as
it
caught
maggie
eye
it
opened
its
mouth
in
a
pathetic
curve
intended
to
represent
an
appeal
you
darling
cried
maggie
suddenly
seized
a
saucer
filled
it
with
milk
and
set
it
on
the
ground
the
small
cat
stepped
daintily
down
and
set
to
work
yes
said
the
other
girl
tentatively
oh
cathcart
well
i
must
say
that
his
theory
fits
in
with
what
father
mahon
says
but
you
know
theology
does
say
that
this
or
that
particular
thing
is
the
devil
or
has
actually
happened
in
any
given
instance
only
that
if
it
really
does
happen
it
is
the
devil
well
this
is
cathcart
idea
it
a
long
story
you
mind
first
he
believes
in
the
devil
in
quite
an
extraordinary
way
oh
yes
i
know
we
do
too
but
it
so
very
real
indeed
with
him
he
believes
that
the
air
is
simply
thick
with
them
all
doing
their
very
utmost
to
get
hold
of
human
beings
yes
i
suppose
we
do
believe
that
too
but
i
expect
that
since
there
are
such
a
quantity
of
things
like
bad
dreams
that
we
used
to
think
were
the
devil
and
now
only
turn
out
to
be
indigestion
that
we
rather
too
skeptical
well
cathcart
believes
both
in
indigestion
so
to
speak
the
devil
he
believes
that
those
evil
spirits
are
at
us
all
the
time
trying
to
get
in
at
any
crack
they
can
find
that
in
one
person
they
produce
lunacy
i
must
say
it
seems
to
me
rather
odd
the
way
in
which
lunatics
so
very
often
become
horribly
blasphemous
and
things
like
that
and
in
another
just
shattered
nerves
and
so
on
they
take
advantage
he
says
of
any
weak
spot
anywhere
now
one
of
the
easiest
ways
of
all
is
through
spiritualism
spiritualism
is
wrong
we
know
that
well
enough
it
is
wrong
because
it
trying
to
live
a
life
and
find
out
things
that
are
beyond
us
at
present
it
on
the
very
lowest
estimate
because
outraging
our
human
nature
yes
mabel
that
his
phrase
good
intentions
therefore
do
protect
us
in
the
least
to
go
to
with
good
intentions
is
like
like
holding
a
in
a
on
behalf
of
an
orphan
asylum
it
not
the
least
protection
i
not
being
profane
my
dear
not
the
least
protection
to
open
the
concert
with
prayer
we
got
no
business
there
at
all
so
we
blown
up
just
the
same
the
danger
oh
the
danger
this
cathcart
says
at
if
they
genuine
and
with
automatic
handwriting
and
all
the
rest
you
deliberately
approach
those
powers
in
a
friendly
way
and
by
the
sort
of
passivity
which
you
got
to
get
yourself
into
you
open
yourself
as
widely
as
possible
to
their
entrance
very
often
they
ca
get
in
and
then
you
only
bothered
but
sometimes
they
can
and
then
you
done
it
particularly
hard
to
get
them
out
again
now
of
course
no
one
in
his
senses
especially
decent
people
would
dream
of
doing
all
this
if
he
knew
what
it
all
meant
so
these
creatures
whatever
they
may
be
always
pretend
to
be
somebody
else
they
very
sharp
they
can
pick
up
all
kinds
of
odds
and
ends
little
tricks
and
little
facts
and
so
with
these
they
impersonate
someone
whom
the
inquirer
very
fond
of
and
they
say
all
sorts
of
pious
happy
little
things
at
first
in
order
to
lead
them
on
so
they
go
on
for
a
long
time
saying
that
religion
quite
true
by
the
way
it
rather
too
odd
the
way
in
which
the
catholic
church
seems
the
one
thing
they
do
like
you
can
be
almost
anything
else
if
you
a
spiritualist
but
you
ca
be
a
catholic
generally
though
they
tell
you
to
say
your
prayers
and
sing
hymns
father
mahon
the
other
day
when
i
was
arguing
with
him
about
having
some
hymns
in
church
said
that
heretics
always
went
in
for
hymns
and
so
you
go
on
then
they
begin
to
hint
that
religion
not
worth
much
and
then
they
attack
morals
cathcart
would
tell
me
about
that
but
he
said
it
got
just
as
bad
as
it
could
be
if
you
did
take
care
maggie
paused
again
looking
rather
serious
her
voice
had
risen
a
little
and
a
new
color
had
come
to
her
face
as
she
talked
she
stooped
to
pick
up
the
saucer
dearest
had
you
better
oh
yes
i
just
about
done
said
maggie
briskly
there
hardly
any
more
well
there
the
idea
they
want
to
get
possession
of
human
beings
and
move
them
so
they
start
like
that
well
that
what
cathcart
says
happened
to
laurie
one
of
those
beasts
came
and
impersonated
poor
amy
he
picked
up
certain
things
about
her
her
appearance
her
trick
of
stammering
and
of
playing
with
her
fingers
and
about
her
grave
and
so
on
and
then
finally
made
his
appearance
in
her
shape
i
do
understand
about
that
murmured
the
girl
oh
my
dear
i
ca
bother
about
that
now
there
a
lot
about
astral
substance
and
so
on
besides
this
is
only
what
cathcart
says
as
i
told
you
i
not
at
all
sure
that
i
believe
one
word
of
it
but
that
his
idea
maggie
stopped
again
suddenly
and
leaned
back
staring
out
at
the
luminous
green
roof
of
hazels
above
her
the
small
cat
could
be
discerned
up
the
leafy
tunnel
swaying
its
body
in
preparation
for
a
pounce
while
overhead
sounded
an
agitated
twittering
mabel
seized
a
pebble
and
threw
it
with
such
success
that
the
swaying
stopped
and
a
reproachful
looked
round
at
her
there
said
mabel
comfortably
and
then
well
what
do
you
really
think
maggie
smiled
reflectively
that
exactly
what
i
do
know
myself
in
the
very
least
as
i
said
all
this
seems
to
me
more
like
a
dream
and
a
very
bad
one
i
think
it
the
the
nastiest
thing
she
added
vindictively
that
ever
come
across
i
do
want
to
hear
one
word
more
about
it
as
long
as
i
live
but
oh
my
dear
why
ca
we
be
all
just
sensible
and
normal
i
love
doing
just
ordinary
little
things
the
garden
and
the
chickens
and
the
cat
and
dog
and
complaining
to
the
butcher
i
can
not
imagine
what
anybody
wants
with
anything
else
yes
i
suppose
i
do
in
a
sort
of
way
believe
cathcart
it
seems
to
me
granted
the
spiritual
world
at
all
which
naturally
i
do
grant
far
the
most
intelligent
explanation
it
seems
to
me
intellectually
far
the
most
explanation
because
it
really
does
take
in
all
the
facts
if
they
are
facts
and
accounts
for
them
reasonably
whereas
the
subjective
self
business
oh
it
frightfully
clever
and
ingenious
but
it
does
assume
such
a
very
great
deal
it
seems
to
me
rather
like
the
people
who
say
that
electricity
accounts
for
everything
electricity
and
as
for
the
imagination
theory
well
that
what
appeals
to
me
now
emotionally
because
i
happen
to
be
in
the
chickens
and
butcher
mood
but
it
does
in
the
least
convince
me
yes
i
suppose
theory
is
the
one
i
ought
to
believe
and
in
a
way
the
one
i
do
believe
but
that
does
in
the
least
prevent
me
from
feeling
it
extraordinarily
unreal
and
impossible
anyhow
it
does
matter
much
again
she
leaned
back
comfortably
smiling
to
herself
and
there
was
a
long
silence
it
was
a
divinely
beautiful
august
evening
from
where
they
sat
little
could
be
seen
except
the
long
vista
of
the
path
arched
with
hazels
whence
the
cat
had
now
disappeared
ending
in
three
old
brick
steps
wide
and
flat
lichened
and
mossed
set
about
with
and
leading
up
to
the
yew
walk
but
the
whole
air
was
full
of
summer
sound
and
life
and
scent
heavy
and
redolent
streaming
in
from
the
old
on
their
right
beyond
the
hedge
and
from
the
orchard
on
the
left
it
was
the
kind
of
atmosphere
suggesting
nature
in
her
most
sensible
mood
normal
perfectly
fulfilling
her
own
vocation
utterly
unmystical
except
by
very
subtle
interpretation
unsuggestive
since
she
was
already
saying
all
that
could
be
said
and
following
out
every
principle
by
which
she
lived
to
the
furthest
confine
of
its
contents
it
presented
the
same
kind
of
completion
and
satisfactoriness
as
that
suggested
by
an
entirely
sensuous
and
comfortable
person
there
were
no
corners
in
it
no
vistas
hinting
at
anything
except
at
some
perfectly
normal
lawn
or
set
garden
no
mystery
no
implication
of
any
other
theory
or
glimpse
of
theory
except
that
which
itself
proclaimed
something
of
its
air
seemed
now
to
breathe
in
maggie
expression
of
contentment
as
she
smiled
softly
and
happily
clasping
her
arms
behind
her
head
she
looked
perfectly
charming
thought
mabel
and
she
laid
a
hand
delicately
on
her
friend
knee
as
if
to
share
in
the
satisfaction
to
verify
it
by
participation
so
to
speak
it
does
seem
to
have
done
you
much
harm
she
said
no
thank
you
i
extremely
well
and
very
content
i
looked
through
the
door
once
without
in
the
least
wishing
to
and
i
do
in
the
least
want
to
look
again
it
not
a
nice
view
but
about
er
religion
said
the
younger
girl
rather
awkwardly
oh
religion
all
right
said
maggie
the
church
gives
me
just
as
much
of
all
that
as
is
good
for
me
and
for
the
rest
just
tells
me
to
be
quiet
and
not
bother
above
all
not
to
peep
or
pry
listeners
hear
no
good
of
themselves
and
i
suppose
that
true
of
the
other
senses
too
at
any
rate
i
going
to
do
my
best
to
mind
nothing
except
my
own
business
is
that
rather
unenterprising
certainly
it
is
that
why
i
like
it
oh
mabel
i
do
want
to
be
so
absolutely
ordinary
all
the
rest
of
my
life
it
so
extremely
rare
and
original
you
know
did
somebody
say
that
there
was
nothing
so
uncommon
as
common
sense
well
that
what
i
going
to
be
a
genius
do
you
understand
the
kind
that
is
an
infinite
capacity
for
taking
pains
not
the
other
sort
what
is
the
other
sort
why
an
infinite
capacity
for
doing
without
them
like
wagner
you
know
well
i
wish
to
be
the
bach
sort
the
kind
of
thing
that
anyone
ought
to
be
able
to
do
only
they
ca
mabel
smiled
doubtfully
lady
laura
was
saying
she
began
presently
maggie
face
turned
suddenly
severe
i
do
wish
to
hear
one
word
but
she
given
it
up
cried
the
girl
she
given
it
up
i
glad
to
hear
it
said
maggie
judicially
and
i
hope
now
that
she
spend
the
rest
of
her
days
in
sackcloth
with
a
scourge
she
added
oh
did
i
tell
you
about
mrs
nugent
about
the
evening
laurie
came
home
yes
well
that
all
right
the
poor
old
dear
got
all
sorts
of
things
on
her
mind
when
it
leaked
out
but
i
talked
to
her
and
we
went
up
together
and
put
flowers
on
the
grave
and
i
said
i
have
a
mass
said
for
amy
though
i
sure
she
does
require
one
the
poor
darling
but
but
do
think
me
brutal
please
providential
her
death
was
just
think
baxter
coming
home
by
the
is
she
maggie
nodded
yes
but
you
know
you
must
say
a
word
to
her
about
all
this
in
fact
she
wo
have
it
she
perfectly
convinced
that
laurie
overworked
himself
laurie
overworked
and
that
that
was
just
all
that
was
the
matter
with
him
auntie
what
called
a
sensible
woman
you
know
and
i
must
say
it
rather
restful
it
what
i
want
to
be
but
it
a
aspiration
i
afraid
though
i
nearer
it
than
i
was
you
mean
she
does
think
anything
odd
happened
at
all
just
so
nothing
at
all
odd
all
very
natural
oh
by
the
way
laurie
swears
he
never
put
his
nose
inside
her
room
that
night
but
absolutely
certain
he
did
and
did
know
it
where
is
mr
lawrence
auntie
made
him
go
abroad
and
when
does
he
come
back
there
was
a
perceptible
pause
lawrence
comes
back
on
saturday
evening
said
maggie
deliberately
