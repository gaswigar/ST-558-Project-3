deep
down
a
tale
of
the
cornish
mines
by
ballantyne
chapter
one
begins
the
story
with
a
peculiar
meeting
necessity
is
the
mother
of
invention
this
is
undoubtedly
true
but
it
is
equally
true
that
invention
is
not
the
only
member
of
large
family
change
of
scene
and
circumstance
are
also
among
her
children
it
was
necessity
that
gave
birth
to
the
resolve
to
travel
to
the
end
of
the
earth
of
english
earth
at
all
events
in
search
of
fortune
which
swelled
the
bosom
of
yonder
tall
youth
who
seated
uncomfortably
on
the
top
of
that
clumsy
public
conveyance
drives
up
street
in
the
ancient
town
of
penzance
yes
necessity
stern
necessity
as
she
is
sometimes
called
drove
that
youth
into
cornwall
and
thus
was
the
originating
cause
of
that
wonderful
series
of
events
which
ultimately
led
to
his
attaining
but
hold
let
us
begin
at
the
beginning
it
was
a
beautiful
morning
in
june
in
that
period
of
the
history
which
is
ambiguously
styled
when
the
kittereen
the
clumsy
vehicle
above
referred
to
rumbled
up
to
the
star
inn
and
stopped
there
the
tall
youth
leapt
at
once
to
the
ground
and
entered
the
inn
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
owned
at
least
the
half
of
the
county
although
his
grey
shooting
costume
and
single
unpretentious
portmanteau
did
not
indicate
either
unusual
wealth
or
exalted
station
in
an
hearty
way
he
announced
to
landlord
waiters
chambermaids
and
to
all
indeed
who
might
choose
to
listen
that
the
weather
was
glorious
that
coaches
of
all
kinds
especially
kittereens
were
detestable
machines
of
torture
and
that
he
meant
to
perform
the
remainder
of
his
journey
on
foot
he
inquired
the
way
to
the
town
of
just
ordered
his
luggage
to
be
forwarded
by
coach
or
cart
and
with
nothing
but
a
stout
oaken
cudgel
to
encumber
him
set
out
on
his
walk
of
about
seven
miles
with
the
determination
of
compensating
himself
for
previous
hours
of
forced
inaction
and
constraint
by
ignoring
roads
and
crossing
the
country
like
an
irish
acting
on
the
presumptuous
belief
that
he
could
find
his
way
to
any
part
of
the
world
with
the
smallest
amount
of
direction
he
naturally
missed
the
right
road
at
the
outset
and
instead
of
taking
the
road
to
just
pursued
that
which
leads
to
the
land
end
the
youth
as
we
have
observed
was
tall
and
athletic
with
an
active
step
erect
gait
and
clear
laughing
eye
he
was
one
whom
a
in
the
guards
would
have
looked
upon
with
a
covetous
sigh
smooth
fair
cheeks
and
chin
told
that
boyhood
was
scarce
out
of
sight
behind
and
an
undeniable
on
the
upper
lip
declared
that
manhood
was
not
far
in
advance
like
most
people
in
what
may
be
termed
an
uncertain
stage
of
existence
our
hero
exhibited
a
variety
of
apparent
contradictions
his
great
size
and
muscular
strength
and
deep
bass
voice
were
those
of
a
man
while
the
smooth
skin
the
soft
curling
hair
and
the
rollicking
gladsome
look
were
all
indicative
of
the
boy
his
countenance
too
might
have
perplexed
a
sometimes
it
was
grave
almost
to
sternness
at
other
times
it
sparkled
with
delight
exhibiting
now
an
expression
that
would
have
befitted
a
sage
on
whose
decisions
hung
the
fate
of
kingdoms
and
anon
displaying
a
dash
of
mischief
worthy
of
the
wildest
boy
in
a
village
school
some
of
the
youth
varied
not
to
say
extravagant
actions
and
expressions
were
perhaps
due
to
the
exhilarating
brilliancy
of
the
morning
or
to
the
appearance
of
those
splendid
castles
which
his
mind
was
actively
engaged
in
building
in
the
air
the
country
through
which
he
travelled
was
at
first
varied
with
trees
and
bushes
clothed
in
rich
foliage
but
soon
its
aspect
changed
and
ere
long
he
pursued
a
path
which
led
over
a
wide
extent
of
wild
moorland
covered
with
purple
heath
and
gorse
in
bloom
the
ground
too
became
so
rough
that
the
youth
was
fain
to
confine
himself
to
the
highroad
but
being
of
an
explorative
disposition
he
quickly
diverged
into
the
lanes
which
in
that
part
of
cornwall
were
and
still
are
sufficiently
serpentine
and
intricate
to
mislead
a
more
experienced
traveller
it
soon
began
to
dawn
upon
the
youth
mind
that
he
was
wandering
in
a
wrong
direction
and
when
he
suddenly
discovered
a
solitary
cottage
on
the
right
hand
which
he
had
previously
observed
on
the
left
he
made
up
his
mind
to
sacrifice
his
independence
and
condescend
to
ask
for
guidance
lightly
leaping
a
wall
with
this
intent
he
crossed
two
fields
and
stooped
as
he
looked
in
at
the
low
doorway
of
the
cottage
from
the
interior
of
which
there
issued
the
loud
cries
of
a
child
either
in
great
pain
or
passion
a
sturdy
little
boy
seated
on
a
stool
and
roaring
like
a
young
bull
while
an
elderly
woman
tried
to
comfort
him
was
the
sight
which
met
his
gaze
can
you
show
me
the
road
to
st
just
inquired
our
adventurer
just
sur
said
the
woman
stepping
out
in
front
of
the
door
why
you
on
the
way
to
buryan
sure
ef
you
do
keep
on
the
right
of
the
hill
over
theere
you
see
the
just
road
a
yell
of
unparalleled
ferocity
issued
at
this
moment
from
the
cottage
and
it
was
found
that
the
noisy
urchin
within
overcome
by
curiosity
had
risen
to
ascertain
who
the
stranger
outside
could
be
and
had
been
arrested
by
a
pang
of
agony
aw
dear
aw
dear
my
poor
booy
exclaimed
the
woman
endeavouring
gently
to
press
the
boy
down
again
on
the
stool
amid
furious
roaring
what
wrong
with
him
asked
our
traveller
entering
the
apartment
he
tumbled
off
the
wall
dear
booy
an
semen
to
me
he
scat
un
shoulder
very
bad
let
me
have
a
look
at
him
said
the
youth
sitting
down
on
the
edge
of
a
bed
which
stood
at
one
end
of
the
room
and
drawing
the
child
between
his
knees
come
little
man
do
shout
so
loud
i
put
it
all
right
for
you
let
me
feel
your
shoulder
to
judge
from
the
immediate
result
the
young
man
seemed
to
put
it
all
wrong
instead
of
all
right
for
his
somewhat
rough
manipulation
of
the
boy
shoulder
produced
such
a
torrent
of
screams
that
the
pitying
woman
had
much
ado
to
restrain
herself
from
rushing
to
the
rescue
ah
exclaimed
the
youth
in
grey
releasing
his
victim
i
thought
so
he
has
broken
his
my
good
woman
not
a
serious
matter
by
any
means
but
it
will
worry
him
for
some
time
to
come
have
you
got
anything
to
make
a
bandage
of
sur
said
the
woman
have
you
a
bit
of
rag
an
old
shirt
or
apron
anything
will
do
the
woman
promptly
produced
a
cotton
shirt
which
the
youth
tore
up
into
long
strips
making
a
pad
of
one
of
these
he
placed
it
under
the
despite
of
sobs
and
resistance
this
pad
acted
as
a
fulcrum
on
which
the
arm
rested
as
a
lever
pressing
the
elbow
close
to
the
side
he
thus
forced
the
shoulder
outwards
and
with
his
left
hand
set
the
bone
with
its
two
broken
ends
together
to
secure
it
in
this
position
he
bound
the
arm
pretty
firmly
to
the
boy
body
so
that
he
could
not
move
a
muscle
of
the
left
arm
or
shoulder
there
said
the
youth
assisting
his
patient
to
put
on
his
shirt
that
will
keep
all
straight
you
must
not
on
any
account
remove
the
bandage
for
some
weeks
how
long
sur
exclaimed
the
woman
in
surprise
for
some
weeks
but
that
will
depend
on
how
the
little
fellow
gets
on
he
may
go
about
and
use
his
right
arm
as
he
pleases
but
no
more
climbing
on
walls
for
some
time
to
come
do
you
hear
little
man
the
urchin
whose
pain
was
somewhat
relieved
and
who
had
moderated
down
to
an
occasional
deep
sob
said
iss
you
a
doctor
sur
i
think
said
the
woman
yes
i
am
and
i
come
to
see
you
again
so
be
careful
to
attend
to
my
directions
good
mornin
sur
an
thank
exclaimed
the
grateful
dame
as
the
youth
left
the
house
and
leaping
the
low
enclosure
in
front
of
it
sped
over
the
moor
in
the
direction
which
had
been
pointed
out
to
him
his
resolution
to
ignore
roads
cost
our
traveller
more
trouble
than
he
had
anticipated
for
the
moor
was
very
rugged
the
brambles
vexatious
and
the
spines
of
the
gorse
uncommonly
sharp
impediments
of
every
kind
were
more
numerous
than
he
had
been
accustomed
to
meet
with
even
on
the
hills
of
scotland
with
which
although
the
land
of
the
mountain
and
the
flood
was
not
that
of
his
birth
he
had
from
childhood
been
familiar
after
a
good
deal
of
vigorous
leaping
and
resolute
scrambling
he
reached
one
of
those
peculiar
cornish
lanes
which
are
so
deeply
sunk
in
the
ground
and
edged
with
such
high
solid
walls
that
the
wayfarer
can
not
in
many
places
see
the
nature
of
the
country
through
which
he
is
passing
the
point
at
which
he
reached
the
lane
was
so
overgrown
with
gorse
and
brambles
that
it
was
necessary
to
search
for
a
passage
through
them
this
not
being
readily
found
he
gave
way
to
the
impetuosity
of
his
disposition
stepped
back
a
few
paces
cleared
the
obstacles
with
a
light
bound
and
alighted
on
the
edge
of
the
bank
which
gave
way
under
his
weight
and
he
descended
into
the
lane
in
a
shower
of
stones
and
dust
landing
on
his
feet
more
by
chance
than
by
dexterity
a
shout
of
indignation
greeted
the
traveller
and
turning
abruptly
round
he
beheld
a
stout
old
gentleman
stamping
with
rage
covered
from
head
to
foot
with
dust
and
sputtering
out
epithets
of
opprobrium
on
the
hapless
wight
who
had
thus
unintentionally
bespattered
him
ugh
hah
you
young
jackanapes
you
blind
dumbledory
ugh
what
mean
you
by
galloping
over
the
country
thus
like
a
wild
ass
eh
a
fit
of
coughing
here
interrupted
the
choleric
old
gentleman
in
the
midst
of
which
our
hero
with
much
humility
of
demeanour
many
apologies
and
protestations
of
innocence
of
intention
to
injure
picked
up
the
old
gentleman
hat
assisted
him
to
brush
his
clothes
with
a
bunch
of
ferns
and
in
various
other
ways
sought
to
pacify
him
the
old
man
grumbled
a
good
deal
at
first
but
was
finally
so
far
mollified
as
to
say
less
testily
while
he
put
on
his
hat
i
warrant
me
young
man
you
are
come
on
some
chase
to
this
region
of
the
land
in
search
of
the
picturesque
eh
a
dauber
on
canvas
no
sir
replied
the
youth
i
profess
not
to
wield
the
pencil
or
brush
although
i
admit
to
having
made
feeble
efforts
as
an
amateur
the
scalpel
is
more
to
my
taste
and
my
object
in
coming
here
is
to
visit
a
relative
i
am
on
my
way
to
just
but
having
wandered
somewhat
out
of
my
road
have
been
obliged
to
strike
into
bypaths
as
you
see
as
i
young
man
yes
and
as
i
replied
the
old
gentleman
with
some
remains
of
asperity
i
have
already
expressed
regret
for
the
mischance
that
has
befallen
you
said
the
youth
in
grey
somewhat
sternly
for
his
impulsive
spirit
fired
a
little
at
the
continued
of
the
old
gentleman
perhaps
you
will
return
good
for
evil
by
pointing
out
the
way
to
just
may
i
venture
to
ask
this
favour
of
you
you
may
venture
and
you
ventured
and
it
is
my
belief
young
man
that
you
venture
many
a
thing
before
this
world
has
done
with
you
however
as
you
are
a
stranger
in
these
parts
and
have
expressed
due
penitence
for
your
misdeed
though
i
more
than
half
doubt
your
sincerity
i
can
do
no
less
than
point
out
the
road
to
just
whither
i
will
accompany
you
at
least
part
of
the
way
and
young
sir
as
you
have
taken
pretty
free
liberty
with
this
morning
may
i
take
the
liberty
of
asking
the
name
of
your
relative
in
just
i
am
well
acquainted
with
most
of
the
inhabitants
of
that
town
certainly
replied
the
youth
the
gentleman
whom
i
am
going
to
visit
is
my
uncle
his
name
is
donnithorne
what
tom
donnithorne
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
in
a
tone
of
surprise
as
he
darted
a
keen
glance
from
under
his
bushy
eyebrows
at
his
companion
hah
then
from
that
fact
i
gather
that
you
are
oliver
trembath
the
young
doctor
whom
he
has
been
expecting
the
last
day
or
two
h
so
old
tom
donnithorne
is
your
uncle
is
he
the
youth
in
grey
did
not
relish
the
free
and
easy
not
to
say
patronising
tone
of
his
companion
and
felt
inclined
to
give
a
sharp
answer
but
he
restrained
his
feelings
and
replied
he
is
and
you
are
correct
in
your
supposition
regarding
myself
do
you
happen
to
know
my
uncle
personally
know
him
personally
cried
the
old
gentleman
with
a
sardonic
laugh
oh
yes
i
know
him
intimately
intimately
some
people
say
he
a
very
good
fellow
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
for
to
say
truth
he
paused
abruptly
ha
i
suppose
you
were
going
to
say
that
you
have
heard
a
different
account
of
him
eh
well
i
going
to
observe
replied
oliver
with
a
laugh
that
my
uncle
is
rather
a
wild
man
for
his
years
addicted
to
smuggling
i
am
told
and
somewhat
given
to
the
bottle
but
it
is
well
known
that
tattlers
give
false
reports
and
i
am
delighted
to
hear
that
the
old
boy
is
not
such
a
bad
fellow
after
all
humph
ejaculated
the
other
then
you
have
never
seen
him
i
suppose
no
never
although
i
am
a
cornishman
i
have
seen
little
of
my
native
county
having
left
it
when
a
little
boy
before
my
uncle
came
to
live
in
this
part
of
the
country
h
well
young
man
i
would
advise
you
to
beware
of
that
same
uncle
of
yours
how
exclaimed
the
youth
in
surprise
did
you
not
tell
me
just
now
that
he
is
a
very
good
fellow
no
sir
i
did
not
i
told
you
that
people
say
he
is
a
very
good
fellow
but
for
myself
i
think
him
an
uncommonly
bad
man
a
man
who
has
done
me
great
injury
in
his
day
it
grieves
me
to
hear
you
say
so
interrupted
oliver
whose
ire
was
again
roused
by
the
tone
and
manner
of
his
companion
a
decidedly
bad
man
continued
the
old
gentleman
not
noticing
the
interruption
a
thorough
rascal
a
smuggler
and
a
drunkard
and
hold
sir
cried
the
youth
sternly
as
he
stopped
and
faced
the
old
gentleman
remember
that
you
speak
of
my
relative
had
you
been
a
younger
man
sir
again
the
youth
paused
abruptly
go
on
sir
said
the
old
gentleman
ironically
you
would
have
pommelled
me
to
a
jelly
with
your
cudgel
i
suppose
is
that
it
acting
somewhat
in
the
spirit
of
your
kinsman
that
same
smuggling
and
tippling
old
scoundrel
who
enough
sir
interrupted
the
young
man
angrily
we
part
company
here
so
saying
he
vaulted
over
the
wall
that
separated
the
road
from
the
moor
and
hurried
away
take
the
first
turn
to
the
left
and
keep
straight
on
else
you
lose
yourself
roared
the
old
gentleman
and
my
compliments
to
the
rascally
old
the
old
scoundrel
muttered
the
youth
as
he
hurried
away
the
young
puppy
growled
the
old
gentleman
as
he
jogged
along
given
to
smuggling
and
the
bottle
indeed
humph
the
excitable
jackanapes
but
i
given
him
a
turn
in
the
wrong
direction
that
will
cool
his
blood
somewhat
and
give
me
leisure
to
cool
mine
too
before
we
meet
again
here
the
old
gentleman
red
countenance
relaxed
into
a
broad
grin
and
he
chuckled
a
good
deal
in
the
midst
of
a
running
commentary
on
the
conduct
and
appearance
of
his
late
companion
from
the
disjointed
sentences
of
which
it
might
have
been
gathered
that
although
his
introduction
to
the
young
doctor
had
been
unfortunate
and
the
succeeding
intercourse
stormy
his
opinion
of
him
was
not
altogether
unfavourable
chapter
two
shows
what
astonishing
results
may
follow
from
taking
the
wrong
road
before
oliver
trembath
had
advanced
half
a
mile
on
his
path
he
had
cooled
sufficiently
to
experience
some
regret
at
having
been
so
quick
to
take
offence
at
one
who
being
evidently
an
eccentric
character
should
not
he
thought
have
been
broken
with
so
summarily
regrets
however
had
come
too
late
so
he
endeavoured
to
shake
off
the
disagreeable
feelings
that
depressed
him
and
the
more
effectually
to
accomplish
this
burst
forth
into
a
bravura
song
with
so
much
emphasis
as
utterly
to
drown
and
no
doubt
to
confound
two
larks
which
up
to
that
time
had
been
pouring
their
melodious
souls
out
of
their
little
bodies
in
the
bright
blue
sky
above
presently
he
came
to
a
part
of
the
moor
where
two
roads
diverged
one
to
the
right
and
the
other
to
the
left
recalling
the
shout
of
advice
which
the
old
gentleman
had
given
him
in
parting
he
took
that
which
led
to
the
left
and
was
gratified
on
gaining
an
eminence
a
short
distance
in
advance
to
see
in
the
far
distance
a
square
turret
which
he
concluded
was
that
of
the
church
of
just
keeping
this
turret
in
view
the
youth
stepped
out
so
vigorously
that
he
soon
reached
the
small
town
that
clustered
round
the
church
and
going
up
to
the
first
man
he
met
said
this
is
the
town
of
just
i
suppose
is
it
not
no
et
thee
come
the
wrang
road
sur
replied
the
rustic
this
es
sennen
just
es
up
over
th
hill
theere
oliver
trembath
first
feeling
was
one
of
surprise
this
was
followed
by
annoyance
which
quickly
degenerated
into
anger
as
it
flashed
into
his
mind
that
the
old
gentleman
might
possibly
have
led
him
wrong
on
purpose
how
far
is
it
to
st
just
he
inquired
six
miles
sur
then
i
suppose
i
am
not
far
from
the
land
end
said
oliver
after
a
pause
no
not
fur
replied
the
man
et
do
lie
straight
before
thanking
the
man
oliver
started
off
at
a
smart
pace
resolving
before
proceeding
to
just
to
visit
this
extreme
western
point
of
england
a
visit
to
which
he
had
often
looked
forward
with
pleasant
anticipation
during
the
last
hour
of
his
walk
the
sun
had
been
obscured
by
clouds
but
just
as
he
approached
the
cliffs
the
clouds
separated
and
a
golden
flood
rushed
over
the
broad
atlantic
which
now
lay
spread
out
before
him
in
all
its
wide
majesty
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
a
good
omen
cried
the
youth
with
a
shout
as
he
hurried
towards
the
shore
intending
to
fling
off
his
garments
and
bathe
in
the
mighty
ocean
which
from
the
place
where
he
first
beheld
it
appeared
to
be
smooth
and
still
as
a
but
oliver
was
compelled
to
restrain
his
ardour
for
on
nearing
the
sea
he
found
that
he
stood
on
the
summit
of
high
cliffs
beyond
which
the
land
end
stretched
in
a
succession
of
broken
masses
of
granite
so
chafed
and
shattered
by
the
action
of
the
sea
and
so
curiously
split
as
to
resemble
basaltic
columns
to
reach
the
outermost
of
those
sentinels
of
old
england
required
some
caution
on
the
part
of
our
traveller
even
although
well
used
to
scaling
the
rocky
heights
of
scottish
mountains
and
when
he
did
at
last
plant
his
foot
on
the
veritable
land
end
he
found
that
it
was
a
precipice
apparently
sixty
feet
high
which
descended
perpendicularly
into
deep
water
his
meditated
bathe
was
therefore
an
impossibility
for
those
glassy
undulations
which
appeared
so
harmless
at
a
distance
gathered
slow
and
gradual
height
as
they
approached
the
land
and
at
last
assuming
the
form
of
majestic
waves
flung
themselves
with
a
grand
roar
on
the
stern
cliffs
which
they
have
battered
so
long
in
vain
and
round
which
always
repulsed
but
never
conquered
they
seethed
in
milky
foam
with
glistening
eye
and
heaving
breast
and
mantling
colour
the
young
doctor
stood
long
and
motionless
on
this
extreme
point
of
land
absorbed
in
admiration
of
the
glorious
scene
before
him
often
had
he
beheld
the
sea
in
the
firths
and
estuaries
of
the
north
but
never
till
now
had
he
conceived
the
grandeur
of
the
great
atlantic
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
waves
of
those
inland
seas
when
tossed
by
wild
storms
were
but
rough
miniature
copies
of
the
huge
billows
which
arose
before
him
without
apparent
cause
and
advancing
without
rush
or
agitation
fell
successively
with
solemn
roar
at
his
feet
awakening
irresistibly
within
him
deep
and
new
thoughts
of
the
almighty
creator
of
earth
and
sea
for
many
minutes
he
stood
entranced
his
mind
wandering
in
a
species
of
calm
delight
over
the
grand
scene
but
incapable
of
fixing
itself
definitely
on
any
special
feature
now
sweeping
out
to
where
the
scilly
isles
could
be
seen
resting
on
the
liquid
horizon
anon
following
the
flight
of
circling
seagulls
or
busy
counting
the
innumerable
ships
and
boats
that
rested
on
the
sea
but
ever
and
anon
recurring
as
if
under
the
influence
of
fascination
to
that
rich
turmoil
of
foam
which
boiled
leaped
and
churned
around
beneath
and
above
the
mighty
breakers
awaking
at
last
from
his
trance
oliver
tore
himself
from
the
spot
and
hastened
away
to
seek
the
nearest
strip
of
sand
where
he
might
throw
off
his
clothes
and
plunge
into
the
boiling
surf
he
proceeded
in
a
southerly
direction
impatiently
expecting
at
every
step
to
discover
some
spot
suitable
for
his
purpose
but
he
had
taken
a
long
and
rapid
walk
before
he
found
a
break
in
those
wild
cliffs
which
afforded
him
the
opportunity
of
descending
to
the
water
edge
here
on
a
narrow
strip
of
sand
he
undressed
and
leaped
into
the
waves
well
was
it
for
oliver
that
day
that
he
had
been
trained
in
all
manly
exercises
that
his
wind
was
good
that
his
muscles
were
hard
his
nerves
well
strung
and
above
all
that
in
earliest
youth
he
had
learned
to
swim
misjudging
in
his
ignorance
the
tremendous
power
of
the
surf
into
which
he
sprang
and
daring
to
recklessness
in
the
conscious
possession
of
unusual
strength
and
courage
he
did
not
pause
to
look
or
consider
but
at
once
struck
out
to
sea
he
was
soon
beyond
the
influence
of
the
breaking
waves
and
for
some
time
sported
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
the
briny
atlantic
waters
then
turning
towards
the
shore
he
swam
in
and
was
speedily
tossing
among
the
breakers
as
he
neared
the
sandy
beach
and
felt
the
full
power
of
the
water
on
his
partially
exhausted
frame
he
experienced
a
slight
feeling
of
anxiety
for
the
thunder
of
each
wave
as
it
fell
and
rushed
up
before
him
in
seething
foam
seemed
to
indicate
a
degree
of
force
which
he
had
not
realised
in
his
first
vigorous
plunge
into
the
sea
a
moment
more
and
a
wave
caught
him
in
its
curling
crest
and
swept
him
onwards
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
oliver
trembath
massive
strength
was
of
no
avail
to
him
he
felt
like
a
helpless
infant
in
another
instant
the
breaker
fell
and
swept
him
with
irresistible
violence
up
the
beach
amid
a
turmoil
of
hissing
foam
no
sooner
did
he
touch
the
ground
than
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
staggered
forward
a
few
paces
but
the
returning
rush
of
water
swept
sand
and
stones
from
beneath
his
feet
carried
his
legs
from
under
him
and
hurled
him
back
into
the
hollow
of
the
succeeding
wave
which
again
rolled
him
on
the
sand
although
somewhat
stunned
oliver
did
not
lose
consciousness
or
he
now
fully
realised
the
extreme
danger
of
his
position
and
the
thought
flashed
through
his
brain
that
at
the
farthest
his
fate
must
be
decided
in
two
or
three
minutes
acting
on
a
brave
spirit
this
thought
nerved
him
to
desperate
effort
the
instant
he
could
plant
his
feet
firmly
he
bounded
forwards
and
then
before
the
backward
rush
of
water
had
gathered
strength
fell
on
his
knees
and
dug
his
fingers
and
toes
deep
into
the
sand
had
the
grasp
been
on
something
firm
he
could
easily
have
held
on
but
the
treacherous
sand
crumbled
out
of
his
grasp
and
a
second
time
he
was
carried
back
into
the
sea
the
next
time
he
was
cast
on
the
beach
he
felt
that
his
strength
was
failing
he
staggered
forward
as
soon
as
he
touched
bottom
with
all
the
energy
of
one
who
avails
himself
of
his
last
chance
but
the
angry
water
was
too
strong
for
him
feeling
that
he
was
being
overpowered
he
cast
his
arms
up
in
the
air
and
gave
utterance
to
a
loud
cry
it
was
not
like
a
cry
of
despair
but
sounded
more
like
what
one
might
suppose
would
be
the
shout
of
a
brave
soldier
when
compelled
to
give
way
fighting
before
the
might
of
overwhelming
force
at
that
moment
a
hand
caught
the
young
man
wrist
and
held
it
for
a
few
seconds
in
a
powerful
grasp
the
wave
retreated
a
staggering
effort
followed
and
the
next
moment
oliver
stood
panting
on
the
beach
grasping
the
rough
hand
of
his
deliverer
semen
to
me
you
was
pretty
nigh
gone
sur
said
the
man
who
had
come
thus
opportunely
to
the
rescue
as
he
wrung
the
from
his
garments
he
was
a
man
of
middle
height
but
of
extremely
powerful
frame
and
was
habited
in
the
garb
of
a
fisherman
truly
i
had
been
gone
altogether
but
for
your
timely
assistance
may
god
reward
you
for
it
said
oliver
earnestly
well
i
do
think
you
would
be
so
ready
to
thank
me
if
you
did
knaw
i
had
half
made
up
my
mind
to
lev
go
oliver
looked
at
the
man
in
some
surprise
for
he
spoke
gruffly
almost
angrily
and
was
evidently
in
earnest
you
are
jesting
said
he
incredulously
jestin
no
i
ai
maister
do
see
the
boat
out
over
he
said
pointing
to
a
small
craft
full
of
men
which
was
being
rowed
swiftly
round
a
point
not
more
than
half
a
mile
distant
the
villains
are
after
me
they
might
as
well
have
tried
to
kitch
a
cunger
by
the
tail
as
nab
jim
cuttance
in
one
of
his
dens
if
he
had
bin
forced
by
the
softness
of
his
to
pull
a
young
fool
out
o
the
say
you
have
to
help
me
to
fight
lad
as
i
saved
your
life
come
follow
me
to
the
cave
but
my
clothes
said
oliver
glancing
round
him
in
search
of
his
garments
they
all
safe
up
here
come
along
sur
an
look
sharp
at
any
other
time
and
in
other
circumstances
oliver
trembath
fiery
spirit
would
have
resented
the
tone
and
manner
of
this
man
address
but
the
feeling
that
he
owed
his
life
to
him
and
that
in
some
way
he
appeared
to
be
the
innocent
cause
of
bringing
misfortune
on
him
induced
him
to
restrain
his
feelings
and
obey
without
question
the
mandate
of
his
rescuer
jim
cuttance
led
the
way
to
a
cave
in
the
rugged
cliffs
the
low
entrance
to
which
was
concealed
by
a
huge
mass
of
granite
the
moment
they
entered
several
voices
burst
forth
in
abuse
of
the
fisherman
for
his
folly
in
exposing
himself
but
the
latter
only
replied
with
a
sarcastic
laugh
and
advised
his
comrades
to
get
ready
for
action
for
he
had
been
seen
by
the
enemy
who
would
be
down
on
them
directly
at
the
same
time
he
pointed
to
oliver
clothes
which
lay
in
a
recess
in
the
side
of
the
cavern
the
youth
dressed
himself
rapidly
and
while
thus
engaged
observed
that
there
were
five
men
in
the
cavern
besides
his
guide
with
whom
they
retired
into
the
farthest
recess
of
the
place
and
entered
into
animated
and
apparently
angry
though
conversation
at
length
their
leader
for
such
he
evidently
was
swung
away
from
them
exclaiming
with
a
laugh
well
well
he
a
good
recruit
and
if
he
should
peach
on
we
us
can
he
concluded
the
sentence
with
a
significant
grunt
now
sur
he
said
advancing
with
his
comrade
towards
oliver
who
was
completing
his
toilet
they
be
here
in
ten
minutes
an
it
is
expected
that
you
will
lend
we
a
hand
here
a
weapon
for
you
so
saying
he
handed
a
large
pistol
to
oliver
who
received
it
with
some
hesitation
i
trust
that
your
cause
is
a
good
one
he
said
you
can
not
expect
me
to
fight
for
you
even
though
i
am
indebted
to
you
for
my
life
without
knowing
against
whom
i
fight
and
why
at
this
a
tall
man
suddenly
cocked
his
pistol
and
uttering
a
fierce
oath
swore
that
if
the
stranger
would
not
fight
he
shoot
him
through
the
head
silence
joe
tonkin
cried
jim
cuttance
in
a
tone
that
at
once
subdued
the
man
oliver
whose
eyes
had
flashed
like
those
of
a
tiger
drew
himself
up
and
said
look
at
me
lads
i
have
no
desire
to
boast
of
what
i
can
or
will
do
but
i
assure
you
it
would
be
as
easy
to
turn
back
the
rising
tide
as
to
force
me
to
fight
against
my
will
except
indeed
with
yourselves
as
i
have
said
i
owe
my
life
to
your
leader
and
apparently
have
been
the
innocent
means
of
drawing
his
enemies
upon
him
gratitude
tells
me
to
help
him
if
i
can
and
help
him
will
if
the
cause
be
not
a
bad
one
well
spoken
sur
said
the
leader
with
an
approving
nod
see
to
the
weapons
maggot
and
i
explain
it
all
to
the
gentleman
so
saying
he
too
oliver
aside
told
him
hurriedly
that
the
men
who
ere
expected
to
attack
them
were
fishermen
belonging
to
a
neighbouring
cove
whose
mackerel
nets
had
been
accidentally
cut
by
his
boat
some
weeks
ago
and
who
were
bent
on
revenge
not
believing
that
the
thing
had
been
done
by
accident
but
surely
you
do
mean
to
use
against
them
in
such
a
quarrel
said
oliver
a
sort
of
humorous
smile
crossed
the
swarthy
countenance
of
the
man
as
he
replied
they
will
use
pistols
against
we
be
that
as
it
may
said
oliver
i
will
never
consent
to
risk
taking
the
life
of
a
countryman
in
such
a
cause
but
you
ca
fight
without
a
weapon
said
the
man
and
sure
if
do
shut
them
they
shut
you
no
matter
i
take
my
chance
said
oliver
my
good
cudgel
would
have
served
me
well
enough
but
it
seems
to
have
been
swept
away
by
the
sea
here
however
is
a
weapon
that
will
suit
me
admirably
he
added
picking
up
a
heavy
piece
of
driftwood
that
lay
at
his
feet
well
if
you
scat
their
heads
with
that
they
wo
want
powder
and
lead
observed
the
other
with
a
grin
as
he
rose
and
returned
to
the
entrance
of
the
cave
where
he
warned
his
comrades
to
keep
as
quiet
as
mice
the
boat
which
had
caused
so
much
angry
discussion
among
the
men
of
the
cave
had
by
this
time
neared
the
beach
and
one
of
the
crew
stood
up
in
the
bow
to
guide
her
into
the
narrow
cove
which
formed
but
a
slight
protection
even
in
calm
weather
against
the
violence
of
that
surf
which
never
ceases
to
grind
at
the
hard
rocks
of
west
cornwall
at
length
they
effected
a
landing
and
the
crew
consisting
of
nine
men
armed
with
pistols
and
cutlasses
hurried
up
to
the
cliffs
and
searched
for
the
entrance
to
the
cavern
while
the
events
which
have
been
related
were
taking
place
the
shades
of
evening
had
been
gradually
creeping
over
land
and
sea
and
the
light
was
at
that
time
scarcely
sufficient
to
permit
of
things
being
distinguished
clearly
beyond
a
few
yards
the
men
in
the
cavern
hid
themselves
in
the
dark
recesses
on
each
side
of
the
entrance
ready
for
the
approaching
struggle
oliver
crouched
beside
his
rescuer
with
the
piece
of
driftwood
by
his
side
turning
suddenly
to
his
companion
he
said
in
an
almost
inaudible
whisper
friend
it
did
not
occur
to
me
before
but
the
men
we
are
about
to
fight
with
will
recognise
me
again
if
we
should
ever
chance
to
meet
could
i
not
manage
to
disguise
myself
in
some
way
if
you
get
shut
replied
his
companion
in
the
same
low
tone
it
matter
much
but
see
here
shut
your
eyes
without
further
remark
the
man
took
a
handful
of
wet
earth
and
smeared
it
over
oliver
face
then
clapping
his
own
on
his
head
he
said
with
a
soft
chuckle
there
your
own
mother
would
knaw
just
then
footsteps
were
heard
approaching
and
the
shadow
of
a
man
was
seen
to
rest
for
a
moment
on
the
gravel
without
the
mouth
of
the
cave
was
so
well
hidden
however
that
he
failed
to
observe
it
and
passed
on
followed
by
several
of
his
comrades
suddenly
one
of
them
stopped
and
said
hold
on
lads
it
ca
be
far
off
i
sartin
sure
i
seed
disappear
hereabouts
you
right
cried
jim
cuttance
with
a
fierce
roar
as
he
rushed
from
the
cavern
and
fired
full
at
the
man
who
had
spoken
the
others
followed
and
a
volley
of
shots
succeeded
while
shouts
of
defiance
and
anger
burst
forth
on
all
sides
oliver
sprang
out
at
the
same
moment
with
the
leader
and
rushed
on
one
of
the
boat
crew
with
such
violence
that
his
foot
slipped
on
a
piece
of
seaweed
and
precipitated
him
to
the
ground
at
the
man
feet
the
other
having
sprung
forward
to
meet
him
was
unable
to
check
himself
tripped
over
his
shoulders
and
fell
on
the
top
of
him
the
man
named
maggot
having
been
in
full
career
close
behind
oliver
tumbled
over
both
followed
by
another
man
named
john
cock
the
others
observing
them
down
rushed
with
a
shout
to
the
rescue
just
as
oliver
making
a
superhuman
effort
flung
the
two
men
off
his
back
and
leaped
to
his
feet
maggot
and
the
boatman
also
sprang
up
and
the
latter
turned
and
made
for
the
boat
at
full
speed
seeing
that
his
comrades
overcome
by
the
suddenness
of
the
onset
were
in
retreat
fighting
as
they
went
all
of
them
succeeded
in
getting
into
the
boat
unharmed
and
were
in
the
act
of
pushing
off
when
jim
cuttance
burning
with
indignation
leaped
into
the
water
grasped
the
bow
of
the
boat
and
was
about
to
plunge
his
cutlass
into
the
back
of
the
man
nearest
him
when
he
was
seized
by
a
strong
hand
from
behind
and
held
back
next
moment
the
boat
was
beyond
his
reach
turning
round
fiercely
the
man
saw
that
it
was
oliver
trembath
who
had
interfered
he
uttered
a
terrible
oath
and
sprang
on
him
like
a
tiger
oliver
stood
firm
parried
with
the
piece
of
driftwood
the
savage
cut
which
was
made
at
his
head
and
with
his
clenched
left
hand
hit
his
opponent
such
a
blow
on
the
chest
as
laid
him
flat
on
the
sand
the
man
sprang
up
in
an
instant
but
instead
of
renewing
the
attack
to
surprise
he
came
forward
and
held
out
his
hand
which
the
youth
was
not
unwilling
to
grasp
thank
sur
he
said
somewhat
sternly
you
done
me
a
sarvice
you
prevented
me
committin
two
murders
an
taught
me
a
lesson
i
never
knaw
afore
that
jim
cuttance
a
invulnerable
i
do
mind
the
blow
sur
not
i
it
wor
in
feer
fight
an
i
was
wrang
i
glad
to
find
that
you
view
the
matter
in
that
light
said
oliver
with
a
smile
and
truly
the
blow
was
given
in
by
one
who
will
never
forget
that
he
owes
you
his
life
a
groan
here
turned
the
attention
of
the
party
to
one
of
their
number
who
had
seated
himself
on
a
rock
during
the
foregoing
dialogue
what
not
hurt
are
dan
said
his
leader
going
towards
him
to
this
dan
replied
with
another
groan
and
placed
his
hand
on
his
hip
his
comrades
crowded
round
him
and
finding
that
he
was
wounded
and
suffering
great
pain
raised
him
in
their
arms
and
bore
him
into
the
cavern
where
they
laid
him
on
the
ground
and
lighting
a
candle
proceeded
to
examine
him
you
had
better
let
me
look
at
him
lads
said
oliver
pushing
the
men
gently
aside
i
am
a
surgeon
they
gave
place
at
once
and
oliver
soon
found
that
the
man
had
received
a
in
his
thigh
fortunately
it
had
been
turned
aside
in
its
course
and
lay
only
a
little
way
beneath
the
skin
so
that
it
was
easily
extracted
by
means
of
a
penknife
now
friends
said
oliver
after
completing
the
dressing
of
the
wound
before
i
met
with
you
i
had
missed
my
way
while
travelling
to
just
will
one
of
you
direct
me
to
the
right
road
and
i
shall
bid
you
as
i
think
you
have
no
further
need
of
my
services
the
men
looked
at
their
leader
whom
they
evidently
expected
to
be
their
spokesman
well
sur
you
have
rendered
we
some
help
this
hevenin
both
in
the
way
o
pickin
out
the
ball
an
helpin
to
break
skulls
as
well
as
preventin
worse
so
we
can
do
no
less
than
show
the
road
but
hark
sur
here
the
man
became
very
impressive
ef
you
do
chance
to
come
across
any
of
us
in
your
travels
you
had
better
not
knaw
us
in
an
way
d
understand
an
us
will
do
the
same
by
thee
of
course
i
will
act
as
you
wish
said
oliver
with
a
smile
although
i
do
not
see
why
we
should
be
ashamed
of
this
affair
seeing
that
we
were
the
party
attacked
there
is
only
one
person
to
whom
i
would
wish
to
explain
the
reason
of
my
not
appearing
sooner
because
he
will
probably
know
of
the
arrival
in
penzance
this
morning
of
the
conveyance
that
brought
me
to
cornwall
and
who
may
that
be
demanded
jim
cuttance
my
uncle
thomas
donnithorne
of
just
said
oliver
whew
whistled
the
fisherman
in
surprise
while
all
the
others
burst
into
a
hearty
fit
of
laughter
why
do
you
laugh
asked
oliver
oh
never
mind
sur
it
all
right
said
the
man
with
a
chuckle
iss
you
may
tell
thomas
donnithorne
there
wo
be
no
harm
in
he
oh
dear
no
again
the
men
laughed
loud
and
long
and
oliver
felt
his
powers
of
forbearance
giving
way
when
cuttance
said
to
him
an
you
may
tell
all
his
friends
too
for
they
the
right
sort
come
now
maggot
here
will
show
the
way
up
to
st
just
so
saying
the
stout
fisherman
conducted
the
young
surgeon
to
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
and
shaking
hands
with
him
left
him
to
the
guidance
of
the
man
named
maggot
who
led
him
through
several
lanes
until
he
reached
the
highroad
between
sennen
and
just
here
he
paused
told
his
companion
to
proceed
straight
on
for
about
four
miles
or
so
when
he
would
reach
the
town
and
bade
him
and
mind
do
go
off
the
road
sur
shouted
maggot
a
few
seconds
after
the
young
man
had
left
him
if
do
want
to
fall
down
a
shaft
and
scat
your
skull
oliver
not
having
any
desire
to
scat
his
skull
whatever
that
might
be
assured
the
man
that
he
would
keep
to
the
road
carefully
the
moon
shone
clear
in
a
cloudless
sky
covering
the
wide
moor
and
the
broad
atlantic
with
a
flood
of
silver
light
and
rendering
the
road
quite
distinct
so
that
our
traveller
experienced
no
further
difficulty
in
pursuing
his
way
he
hurried
forward
at
a
rapid
pace
yet
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
pause
frequently
and
gaze
in
admiration
on
the
scene
of
desolate
grandeur
around
him
on
such
occasions
he
found
it
difficult
to
believe
that
the
stirring
events
of
the
last
few
hours
were
real
indeed
if
it
had
not
been
that
there
were
certain
uneasy
portions
of
his
frame
the
result
of
his
recent
encounter
on
the
beach
which
afforded
constant
and
convincing
evidence
that
he
was
awake
he
would
have
been
tempted
to
believe
that
the
adventures
of
that
day
were
nothing
more
than
a
vivid
dream
chapter
three
introduces
a
few
more
characters
and
homely
incidents
it
was
late
when
our
hero
entered
the
little
town
of
just
and
inquired
for
the
residence
of
his
uncle
thomas
donnithorne
he
was
directed
to
one
of
the
most
respectable
of
the
group
of
old
houses
that
stood
close
to
the
venerable
parish
church
from
which
just
derives
its
title
of
he
tapped
at
the
door
which
was
opened
by
an
elderly
female
does
mr
thomas
donnithorne
live
here
asked
oliver
iss
sur
he
do
answered
the
woman
walk
in
sur
she
ushered
him
into
a
small
parlour
in
which
was
seated
a
pretty
little
girl
still
in
or
only
just
out
of
her
teens
oliver
was
so
taken
aback
by
the
unexpected
sight
that
he
stood
gazing
for
a
moment
or
two
in
rather
stupid
silence
your
name
is
oliver
trembath
i
presume
said
the
girl
rising
and
laying
down
the
piece
of
needlework
with
which
she
was
occupied
it
is
replied
oliver
in
some
surprise
as
he
blundered
out
an
apology
for
his
rudeness
pray
sit
down
sir
said
the
girl
we
have
been
expecting
you
for
some
time
and
my
uncle
told
me
to
act
the
part
of
hostess
till
his
return
your
uncle
exclaimed
oliver
whose
not
to
say
impudence
returned
immediately
if
thomas
donnithorne
be
indeed
your
uncle
then
fair
maid
you
and
i
must
needs
be
cousins
the
which
i
confess
fills
me
with
satisfaction
and
also
with
somewhat
of
surprise
for
up
to
this
hour
i
have
been
ignorant
of
my
good
fortune
in
being
related
to
so
so
i
made
a
mistake
sir
said
the
girl
interrupting
a
speech
which
was
evidently
verging
towards
impropriety
in
calling
mr
donnithorne
uncle
to
you
who
are
not
aware
it
seems
that
i
am
only
an
adopted
niece
not
aware
of
it
of
course
not
said
oliver
throwing
himself
into
a
large
armchair
while
his
fair
companion
busied
herself
in
spreading
the
board
for
a
substantial
meal
i
could
not
be
aware
of
much
that
has
occurred
in
this
distant
part
of
the
kingdom
seeing
that
my
worthy
uncle
has
vouchsafed
to
write
me
only
two
letters
in
the
course
of
my
life
once
many
years
ago
to
condole
with
me
in
about
ten
lines
address
and
signature
included
on
the
death
of
my
dear
mother
and
once
again
to
tell
me
he
had
procured
an
appointment
for
me
as
in
the
mining
district
of
just
he
must
have
been
equally
uncommunicative
to
my
mother
for
she
never
mentioned
your
existence
however
since
i
have
now
made
the
agreeable
discovery
i
trust
that
you
will
dispense
with
ceremony
and
allow
me
at
once
to
call
you
cousin
by
the
way
you
have
not
yet
told
me
your
name
the
maiden
who
was
charmingly
unsophisticated
replied
that
her
name
was
rose
ellis
and
that
she
had
no
objection
whatever
to
being
called
cousin
without
delay
well
cousin
rose
said
oliver
if
it
be
not
prying
into
secrets
i
should
like
to
know
how
long
it
is
since
my
uncle
adopted
you
about
nineteen
years
ago
replied
rose
oh
said
oliver
remonstratively
before
you
were
born
impossible
rose
laughed
a
short
clear
little
laugh
which
she
nipped
in
the
bud
abruptly
and
replied
well
it
was
only
a
short
time
after
i
was
born
i
was
wrecked
on
this
coast
the
expressive
face
here
became
very
grave
and
all
on
board
our
ship
perished
except
myself
oliver
saw
at
once
that
he
had
touched
on
a
tender
subject
and
hastened
to
change
it
by
asking
a
number
of
questions
about
his
uncle
from
which
he
gradually
diverged
to
the
recent
events
in
his
own
history
which
he
began
to
relate
with
much
animation
his
companion
was
greatly
interested
and
amused
she
laughed
often
and
heartily
in
a
melodious
undertone
and
oliver
liked
her
laugh
for
it
was
peculiar
and
had
the
effect
of
displaying
a
double
row
of
pretty
little
teeth
and
of
almost
entirely
shutting
up
her
eyes
she
seemed
to
enjoy
a
laugh
so
much
that
he
exerted
all
his
powers
to
tickle
her
risible
faculties
and
dwelt
long
and
graphically
on
his
meeting
with
the
irascible
old
gentleman
in
the
lane
he
was
still
busy
with
this
part
of
the
discourse
when
a
heavy
step
was
heard
outside
there
my
uncle
exclaimed
rose
springing
up
a
moment
after
the
door
opened
and
in
walked
the
identical
irascible
old
gentleman
himself
if
a
petrified
impersonation
of
astonishment
had
been
a
possibility
oliver
trembath
would
on
that
occasion
have
presented
the
phenomenon
he
sat
or
rather
lay
extended
for
at
least
half
a
minute
with
his
eyes
wide
and
his
mouth
partly
open
bereft
alike
of
the
powers
of
speech
and
motion
heyday
young
man
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
planting
his
sturdy
frame
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
as
if
he
meant
then
and
there
to
demand
and
exact
an
ample
apology
or
to
inflict
condign
and
terrible
chastisement
for
past
misdeeds
you
appear
to
be
making
yourself
quite
at
home
eh
my
sir
exclaimed
oliver
leaping
up
with
a
look
of
dismay
how
can
i
express
my
my
but
is
it
it
be
possible
that
you
are
mr
donnithorne
uncle
oliver
expression
and
the
look
of
amazement
on
the
countenance
of
rose
ellis
who
could
not
account
for
such
a
strange
reception
of
her
cousin
proved
almost
too
much
for
the
old
gentleman
whose
eyes
had
already
begun
to
twinkle
ay
young
man
i
am
tom
donnithorne
your
uncle
the
vile
old
smuggling
rascal
who
met
his
respectful
nephew
on
the
road
to
just
at
this
point
rose
suddenly
pressed
her
hand
over
her
mouth
darted
to
her
own
apartment
in
a
distant
corner
of
the
house
and
there
seated
on
her
little
bed
went
into
what
is
not
inaptly
styled
fits
of
laughter
and
who
now
continued
the
old
gentleman
relaxing
into
a
genial
smile
and
grasping
his
nephew
hand
welcomes
oliver
trembath
to
his
house
with
all
his
heart
and
soul
there
who
will
say
after
that
that
old
donnithorne
does
not
know
how
to
return
good
for
evil
but
my
dear
uncle
began
oliver
allow
me
to
explain
now
now
look
at
that
kept
me
hours
too
late
for
supper
already
and
he
going
to
take
up
more
time
with
explanations
cried
the
old
gentleman
flinging
himself
on
the
chair
from
which
oliver
had
risen
and
wiping
his
bald
pate
with
a
red
silk
handkerchief
what
can
you
explain
boy
except
that
you
met
an
angry
old
fellow
in
a
lane
who
called
your
uncle
such
hard
names
that
you
could
help
giving
him
a
bit
of
your
mind
there
there
sit
down
sit
hallo
he
shouted
starting
up
impulsively
and
thrusting
his
head
into
the
passage
rose
rose
i
say
where
are
you
hallo
coming
uncle
i
here
the
words
came
back
like
an
echo
and
in
another
minute
rose
appeared
with
a
countenance
come
along
lass
let
have
supper
without
delay
where
is
aunty
rout
her
out
and
tell
that
jade
of
a
cook
that
if
she
do
dish
up
in
five
minutes
i
i
well
oliver
talking
of
explanations
how
comes
it
that
you
are
so
late
because
i
took
the
wrong
road
after
leaving
you
in
the
lane
replied
the
youth
with
a
significant
glance
at
his
uncle
whose
eyes
were
at
the
moment
fixed
gravely
on
the
ground
the
wrong
road
eh
said
mr
donnithorne
looking
up
with
a
sly
glance
and
then
laughing
well
well
it
was
only
pro
boy
you
put
a
good
deal
of
unnecessary
earth
and
stones
over
my
head
so
i
thought
it
was
but
fair
that
i
should
put
a
good
deal
more
of
the
same
under
your
feet
besides
giving
you
the
advantage
of
seeing
the
land
end
which
of
course
every
youth
of
intelligence
must
take
a
deep
interest
in
beholding
but
sure
a
walk
thither
and
thence
to
just
could
not
have
detained
you
so
long
truly
no
replied
oliver
i
had
a
rencontre
a
sort
of
adventure
with
fishermen
which
fishermen
exclaimed
mr
donnithorne
in
surprise
are
ye
sure
they
were
not
smugglers
eh
they
said
they
were
fishermen
and
they
looked
like
such
replied
oliver
but
my
adventure
with
them
whatever
they
were
was
the
cause
of
my
detention
and
i
can
only
express
my
grief
that
the
circumstance
has
incommoded
your
household
but
you
see
it
took
some
time
to
beat
off
the
boat
crew
and
then
i
had
to
examine
a
wound
and
extract
what
say

mr

mr

a
bit
of
supper
with
hospitable
urgency
mr
donnithorne
and
his
good
dame
pressed
their
guests
to
do
justice
to
the
fare
set
before
them
and
during
the
course
of
the
meal
the
former
kept
up
a
running
fire
of
question
comment
and
reply
on
every
conceivable
subject
so
that
his
auditors
required
to
do
little
more
than
eat
and
listen
after
supper
however
and
when
tumblers
and
glasses
were
being
put
down
he
gave
the
others
an
opportunity
of
leading
the
conversation
now
oliver
he
said

glass

your
adventures

and
copper
our
three
staples
oliver
the
bone
muscle
and
fat
of
the
county
fish
tin
and
copper
echoed
captain
dan
in
good
sooth
continued
mr
donnithorne
i
have
often
thought
of
turning
teetotaller
myself
but
feared
to
do
so
lest
my
wife
should
take
to
drinking
just
out
of
opposition
however
let
that
pass
and
now
oliver
open
thy
mouth
lad
and
relate
those
surprising
adventures
of
which
you
have
given
me
a
hint
indeed
uncle
i
do
not
say
they
are
very
surprising
although
doubtless
somewhat
new
to
one
who
has
been
bred
if
not
born
in
comparatively
quiet
regions
of
the
earth
here
oliver
related
circumstantially
to
his
wondering
auditors
the
events
which
befell
him
after
the
time
when
he
left
his
uncle
in
the
lane
being
interrupted
only
with
an
occasional
exclamation
until
he
reached
the
part
when
he
knocked
down
the
man
who
had
rescued
him
from
the
waves
when
mr
donnithorne
interrupted
him
with
an
uncontrollable
burst
ha
shouted
the
old
gentleman
what
knocked
down
the
man
who
saved
your
life
nephew
fie
fie
but
you
have
not
told
us
his
name
yet
what
was
it
his
comrades
called
him
jim
as
i
have
said
and
i
think
that
he
once
referred
to
himself
as
jim
cuttance
or
something
like
that
what
say
you
boy
exclaimed
mr
donnithorne
pushing
back
his
chair
and
gazing
at
his
nephew
in
amazement
hast
fought
side
by
side
with
jim
cuttance
and
then
knocked
him
down
indeed
i
have
said
oliver
not
quite
sure
whether
his
uncle
regarded
him
as
a
hero
or
a
fool
the
roar
of
laughter
which
his
answer
drew
from
captain
dan
and
his
uncle
did
not
tend
to
enlighten
him
much
oh
oliver
oliver
said
the
old
gentleman
on
recovering
some
degree
of
composure
you
should
have
lived
in
the
days
of
good
king
arthur
and
been
one
of
the
knights
of
the
round
table
knocked
down
jim
cuttance
what
captain
dan
i
think
said
the
captain
still
chuckling
quietly
that
the
less
our
friend
says
about
the
matter
the
better
for
himself
why
so
inquired
oliver
quickly
because
replied
his
uncle
with
some
return
of
gravity
you
have
assisted
one
of
the
most
notorious
smugglers
that
ever
lived
to
fight
his
majesty
coastguard
that
all
what
say
you
molly
shall
we
convict
oliver
on
his
own
confession
the
good
lady
thus
appealed
to
admitted
that
it
was
a
serious
matter
but
urged
that
as
oliver
did
the
thing
in
ignorance
and
out
of
gratitude
he
ought
to
be
forgiven
think
he
ought
to
be
forgiven
for
having
knocked
down
jim
cuttance
said
captain
dan
is
he
then
so
notorious
asked
oliver
why
he
is
the
most
daring
smuggler
on
the
coast
replied
captain
dan
and
has
given
the
preventive
men
more
trouble
than
all
the
others
put
together
in
fact
he
is
a
man
who
deserves
to
be
hanged
and
will
probably
come
to
his
proper
end
ere
long
if
not
shot
in
a
brawl
beforehand
i
fear
he
stands
some
chance
of
it
now
said
mr
donnithorne
with
a
sigh
for
he
has
been
talking
of
erecting
a
battery
near
his
den
at
prussia
cove
and
openly
defying
the
government
men
you
seem
to
differ
from
captain
dan
uncle
in
reference
to
this
man
said
oliver
with
a
smile
truly
i
do
for
although
i
condemn
smuggling
ahem
the
old
gentleman
cast
a
peculiar
glance
at
the
captain
i
do
like
to
see
a
sturdy
man
hanged
or
shot
and
jim
cuttance
is
a
stout
fellow
i
question
much
whether
you
could
find
his
match
captain
dan
amongst
all
your
men
that
i
could
easily
said
the
captain
with
a
quiet
smile
pardon
me
captain
said
oliver
my
uncle
has
not
yet
informed
me
on
the
point
may
i
ask
what
corps
you
belong
to
to
a
sturdy
corps
of
tough
lads
answered
the
captain
with
another
of
his
quiet
smiles
men
who
have
smelt
powder
most
of
since
they
were
little
boys
live
on
the
battlefield
i
may
say
almost
night
and
day
spring
more
mines
in
a
year
than
all
the
soldiers
in
the
world
put
together
and
shorten
their
lives
by
the
stern
labour
they
undergo
but
they
burn
powder
to
raise
not
to
waste
metal
their
uniform
is
red
too
though
not
quite
so
red
nor
yet
so
elegant
as
that
of
the
men
in
his
majesty
service
i
am
one
of
the
underground
captains
sir
of
botallack
mine
captain
dan
colour
heightened
a
very
little
and
the
tones
of
his
voice
became
a
little
more
powerful
as
he
concluded
this
reply
but
there
was
no
other
indication
that
the
enthusiastic
soul
of
one
of
the
captains
of
the
most
celebrated
mine
in
cornwall
was
moved
oliver
felt
however
the
contact
with
a
kindred
spirit
and
expressing
much
interest
in
the
mines
proceeded
to
ask
many
questions
of
the
captain
who
nothing
loath
answered
all
his
queries
and
explained
to
him
that
he
was
one
of
the
captains
or
agents
whose
duty
it
was
to
superintend
the
men
and
the
works
below
the
surface
hence
the
title
of
underground
while
those
who
the
works
above
ground
were
styled
grass
or
surface
captains
he
also
made
an
appointment
to
conduct
the
young
doctor
underground
and
go
over
the
mine
with
him
at
an
early
date
while
the
party
in
old
mr
donnithorne
dwelling
were
thus
enjoying
themselves
a
great
storm
was
gathering
and
two
events
very
different
from
each
other
in
character
were
taking
place
the
one
quiet
and
apparently
unimportant
the
other
tremendous
and
fatal
both
bearing
on
and
seriously
influencing
the
subjects
of
our
tale
chapter
four
at
work
under
the
sea
chip
chip
chip
down
in
the
dusky
mine
oh
but
the
rock
at
which
the
miner
chipped
was
hard
and
the
bit
of
rock
on
which
he
sat
was
hard
and
the
muscles
with
which
he
toiled
were
hard
from
prolonged
labour
and
the
lot
of
the
man
seemed
hard
as
he
sat
there
in
the
hot
heavy
atmosphere
hour
after
hour
from
morn
till
eve
with
the
sweat
pouring
down
his
brow
and
over
his
naked
shoulders
toiling
and
moiling
with
hammer
and
chisel
but
stout
david
trevarrow
did
not
think
his
lot
peculiarly
hard
his
workshop
was
a
low
narrow
tunnel
deep
down
under
the
surface
of
the
earth
ay
and
deep
under
the
bottom
of
the
sea
his
daily
sun
was
a
tallow
candle
which
rose
regularly
at
seven
in
the
morning
and
set
at
three
in
the
afternoon
his
atmosphere
was
sadly
deficient
in
oxygen
and
much
vitiated
by
gunpowder
smoke
his
working
costume
consisted
only
of
a
pair
of
linen
trousers
his
colour
from
top
to
toe
was
red
as
owing
to
the
iron
ore
around
him
his
food
was
a
slice
of
bread
with
perchance
when
he
was
unusually
luxurious
the
addition
of
a
cornish
pasty
and
his
drink
was
water
to
an
inexperienced
eye
the
man
work
would
have
appeared
not
only
hard
but
hopeless
for
although
his
hammer
was
heavy
his
arm
strong
and
his
chisel
sharp
and
tempered
well
each
blow
produced
an
apparently
insignificant
effect
on
the
flinty
rock
frequently
a
spark
of
fire
was
all
that
resulted
from
a
blow
and
seldom
did
more
than
a
series
of
little
chips
fly
off
although
the
man
was
of
herculean
mould
and
worked
with
a
will
as
was
evident
from
the
kind
of
gasp
or
stern
expulsion
of
the
breath
with
which
each
blow
was
accompanied
unaided
human
strength
he
knew
could
not
achieve
much
in
such
a
process
so
he
directed
his
energies
chiefly
to
the
boring
of
and
left
it
to
the
mighty
power
of
gunpowder
to
do
the
hard
work
of
rending
the
rich
ore
from
the
bowels
of
the
unwilling
earth
yes
the
work
was
very
hard
probably
the
hardest
that
human
muscles
are
ever
called
on
to
perform
in
this
toiling
world
but
again
we
say
that
david
trevarrow
did
not
think
so
for
he
had
been
born
to
the
work
and
bred
to
it
and
was
blissfully
ignorant
of
work
of
a
lighter
kind
so
that
although
his
brows
frowned
at
the
obstinate
rock
his
compressed
lips
smiled
for
his
thoughts
were
pleasant
and
far
away
the
unfettered
mind
was
above
ground
roaming
in
fields
of
light
basking
in
sunshine
and
holding
converse
with
the
birds
as
he
sat
there
chip
chip
chipping
down
in
the
dusky
mine
stopping
at
last
the
miner
wiped
his
brow
and
rising
stood
for
a
few
moments
silently
regarding
the
result
of
his
day
work
now
david
said
he
to
himself
the
question
is
what
shall
us
do
shall
us
keep
on
or
shall
us
knack
he
paused
as
if
unable
to
answer
the
question
after
a
time
he
muttered
keep
on
it
do
look
promisin
sure
an
it
poor
pay
but
it
wo
do
to
give
in
yet
poor
pay
it
was
indeed
for
the
man
earnings
during
the
past
month
had
been
barely
ten
shillings
but
david
trevarrow
had
neither
wife
child
nor
mother
to
support
so
he
could
afford
to
toil
for
poor
pay
and
being
of
a
remarkably
hopeful
and
cheery
disposition
he
returned
home
that
afternoon
resolved
to
persevere
in
his
unproductive
toil
in
the
hope
that
at
last
he
should
discover
a
good
bunch
of
copper
or
a
keenly
lode
of
tin
david
was
what
his
friends
and
the
world
styled
unfortunate
in
early
manhood
he
had
been
a
somewhat
wild
and
reckless
fellow
a
noted
wrestler
and
an
adept
in
all
manly
sports
and
games
but
a
disappointment
in
love
had
taught
him
very
bitterly
that
life
is
not
all
sunshine
and
this
coupled
with
a
physical
injury
which
was
the
result
of
his
own
folly
crushed
his
spirit
so
much
that
his
comrades
believed
him
to
be
a
lost
man
the
injury
referred
to
was
the
bursting
of
a
in
the
lungs
it
was
and
still
is
the
custom
of
the
youthful
miners
of
cornwall
to
test
their
strength
by
racing
up
the
almost
interminable
ladders
by
which
the
mines
are
reached
this
tremendous
exertion
after
a
day
of
severe
toil
affected
them
of
course
very
severely
and
in
some
cases
seriously
many
an
man
has
by
this
means
brought
himself
to
a
premature
end
among
others
david
trevarrow
excelled
and
suffered
no
one
could
beat
him
in
running
up
the
ladders
but
one
day
on
reaching
the
surface
blood
issued
from
his
mouth
and
thenceforth
his
racing
and
wrestling
days
were
ended
and
his
spirit
was
broken
a
long
illness
succeeded
then
he
began
to
mend
slowly
and
by
degrees
his
strength
returned
but
not
his
joyous
spirit
still
it
was
some
comfort
to
feel
able
for
work
again
and
he
went
underground
with
some
degree
of
his
old
vigour
though
not
with
the
light
heart
or
light
step
of
former
days
but
bad
fortune
seemed
to
follow
him
everywhere
when
others
among
his
comrades
were
fortunate
in
finding
copper
or
tin
david
was
most
unaccountably
unsuccessful
accidents
too
from
falls
and
explosions
laid
him
up
more
than
once
and
he
not
only
acquired
the
character
of
an
unlucky
man
from
his
friends
but
despite
a
naturally
sanguine
temperament
he
began
himself
to
believe
that
he
was
one
of
the
unluckiest
fellows
in
the
world
about
this
time
the
followers
of
that
noble
christian
john
wesley
began
to
make
an
impression
on
cornwall
and
to
exert
an
influence
which
created
a
mighty
change
in
the
hearts
and
manners
of
the
people
and
the
blessed
effects
of
which
are
abundantly
evident
at
the
present
day
to
the
rejoicing
of
every
christian
soul
one
of
those
ministers
of
our
lord
happened
to
meet
with
david
trevarrow
and
was
the
means
of
opening
his
eyes
to
many
great
and
previously
unknown
truths
among
others
he
convinced
him
that
god
ways
are
not
as
man
ways
that
he
often
though
not
always
leads
his
people
by
thorny
paths
that
they
know
not
of
but
does
it
in
love
and
with
his
own
glory
in
their
happiness
as
the
end
in
view
that
the
lord
jesus
christ
must
be
to
a
man
the
chiefest
among
ten
thousand
and
altogether
lovely
else
he
is
to
him
nothing
at
all
and
that
he
could
be
convinced
of
all
these
truths
only
by
the
holy
spirit
it
were
vain
to
attempt
to
tell
all
that
this
good
man
said
to
the
unhappy
miner
but
certain
it
is
that
from
that
time
forth
david
became
himself
again
and
yet
not
himself
the
desire
to
wrestle
and
fight
and
race
returned
in
a
new
form
he
began
to
wrestle
with
principalities
and
powers
to
fight
the
good
fight
of
faith
and
to
run
the
race
set
before
him
in
the
gospel
the
old
hearty
smile
and
laugh
and
cheery
disposition
also
returned
and
the
hopeful
spirit
and
so
much
of
the
old
robust
health
and
strength
that
it
seemed
as
if
none
of
the
evil
effects
of
the
ruptured
remained
so
david
trevarrow
went
as
of
old
daily
to
the
mine
it
is
true
that
riches
did
not
flow
in
upon
him
any
faster
than
before
but
he
did
not
mind
that
much
for
he
had
discovered
another
mine
in
which
he
toiled
at
nights
after
the
day
toil
was
over
and
whence
he
extracted
treasure
of
greater
value
than
copper
or
tin
or
even
gold
treasure
which
he
scattered
in
a
sabbath
school
with
liberal
hand
and
found
himself
all
the
richer
for
his
prodigality
occasionally
after
prolonged
labour
in
confined
and
bad
air
a
faint
trace
of
the
old
complaint
showed
itself
when
he
reached
the
top
of
the
ladders
but
he
was
not
now
depressed
by
that
circumstance
as
he
used
to
be
he
was
past
his
prime
at
the
period
of
which
we
write
and
a
confirmed
bachelor
to
return
from
this
digression
david
trevarrow
made
up
his
mind
as
we
have
said
to
go
on
and
being
a
man
of
resolute
purpose
he
went
on
seized
his
hammer
and
chisel
and
continued
perseveringly
to
smite
the
flinty
rock
surrounded
by
thick
darkness
which
was
not
dispelled
but
only
rendered
visible
by
the
feeble
light
of
the
tallow
candle
that
flared
at
his
side
over
his
head
rolled
the
billows
of
the
atlantic
the
whistling
wind
howled
among
the
wild
cliffs
of
the
cornish
coast
but
they
did
not
break
the
deep
silence
of
the
miner
place
of
midnight
toil
artillery
was
rending
the
sky
and
causing
the
hearts
of
men
to
beat
slow
with
awe
the
great
boulders
ground
the
pebbles
into
sand
as
they
crashed
to
and
fro
above
him
but
he
heard
them
not
or
if
he
did
the
sound
reached
him
as
a
mysterious
murmur
for
being
in
one
of
the
low
levels
with
many
fathoms
of
solid
rock
between
him
and
the
bottom
of
the
superincumbent
sea
he
was
beyond
the
reach
of
such
disturbing
influences
tremendous
though
they
were
the
miner
was
making
a
final
effort
at
his
unproductive
piece
of
rock
and
had
prolonged
his
toil
far
into
the
night
hour
after
hour
he
wrought
almost
without
a
moment
respite
save
for
the
purpose
now
and
then
of
trimming
his
candle
when
his
right
arm
grew
tired
he
passed
the
hammer
swiftly
to
his
left
hand
and
turning
the
borer
with
his
right
continued
to
work
with
renewed
vigour
at
last
he
paused
and
looking
over
his
shoulder
called
out
zackey
booy
the
sound
died
away
in
a
hollow
echo
through
the
retiring
galleries
of
the
mine
but
there
was
no
reply
zackey
booy
are
slaipin
he
repeated
a
small
bundle
which
lay
in
a
recess
close
at
hand
uncoiled
itself
like
a
hedgehog
and
yawning
vociferously
sat
up
revealing
the
fact
that
the
bundle
was
a
boy
ded
call
uncle
asked
the
boy
in
a
sleepy
tone
iss
did
i
said
the
man
fetch
me
the
powder
an
fuse
my
son
the
lad
rose
and
fetching
out
of
a
dark
corner
the
articles
required
assisted
in
charging
the
hole
which
his
uncle
had
just
finished
boring
this
was
the
last
hole
which
the
man
intended
to
blast
that
night
for
weeks
past
he
had
laboured
day
after
day
sometimes
as
on
the
present
occasion
at
night
and
had
removed
many
tons
of
rock
without
procuring
either
tin
or
copper
sufficient
to
repay
him
for
his
toil
so
that
he
resolved
to
give
it
up
and
remove
to
a
more
hopeful
part
of
the
mine
or
betake
himself
to
another
mine
altogether
he
had
now
bored
his
last
hole
and
was
about
to
blast
it
applying
his
candle
to
the
end
of
the
fuse
he
hastened
along
the
level
to
a
sufficient
distance
to
afford
security
warning
his
nephew
as
he
passed
zackey
leaped
up
and
scrambling
over
the
debris
with
which
the
bottom
of
the
level
was
covered
made
good
his
retreat
about
a
minute
they
waited
in
expectancy
suddenly
there
was
a
bright
blinding
flash
which
lit
up
the
rugged
sides
of
the
mine
and
revealed
its
cavernous
ramifications
and
black
depths
this
was
accompanied
by
a
dull
smothered
report
and
a
crash
of
falling
rock
together
with
a
shower
of
debris
instantly
the
whole
place
was
in
profound
darkness
aw
booy
exclaimed
the
miner
we
was
too
near
it
have
knacked
us
in
the
dark
have
uncle
i
go
an
search
for
the
box
do
my
son
said
david
in
those
days
lucifer
matches
had
not
been
invented
and
light
had
to
be
struck
by
means
of
flint
steel
and
tinder
the
process
was
tedious
compared
with
the
rapid
action
of
congreves
and
vestas
in
the
present
day
the
man
chipped
away
for
full
three
minutes
before
he
succeeded
in
relighting
his
candle
this
done
the
rock
was
examined
bad
still
uncle
david
inquired
the
boy
iss
zackey
maggot
so
we
and
try
the
higher
mine
having
come
to
this
conclusion
uncle
david
threw
down
the
mass
of
rock
which
he
held
in
his
brawny
hands
and
picking
up
his
implements
said
get
the
tools
booy
and
lev
us
go
to
grass
zackey
who
had
been
in
the
mine
all
day
and
was
tired
tied
his
tools
at
each
end
of
a
rope
so
that
they
might
be
slung
over
his
shoulder
and
leave
his
hands
free
trevarrow
treated
his
in
the
same
way
and
removing
his
candle
from
the
wall
fixed
it
on
the
front
of
his
hat
by
the
simple
process
of
sticking
thereto
the
lump
of
clay
to
which
it
was
attached
zackey
having
fixed
his
candle
in
the
same
manner
both
of
them
put
on
their
flannel
shirts
and
linen
coats
and
traversed
the
level
until
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
here
they
paused
for
a
few
moments
before
commencing
the
long
wearisome
ascent
of
almost
perpendicular
ladders
by
which
the
miners
descended
to
their
work
or
returned
to
grass
as
they
termed
the
act
of
returning
to
the
surface
it
cost
them
more
than
half
an
hour
of
steady
climbing
before
they
reached
the
upper
part
of
the
shaft
and
became
aware
that
a
storm
was
raging
in
the
regions
above
on
emerging
from
the
mouth
of
the
shaft
or
ladder
road
man
and
boy
were
in
a
profuse
perspiration
and
the
sharp
gale
warned
them
to
hasten
to
the
at
full
speed
were
little
buildings
in
which
miners
were
wont
to
change
their
wet
underground
garments
for
dry
clothes
some
of
these
used
to
be
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
shafts
and
the
men
were
often
injured
while
going
to
them
from
the
mine
by
being
exposed
in
an
overheated
state
to
cutting
winds
many
a
stout
miner
has
had
a
chill
given
him
in
this
way
which
has
resulted
in
premature
death
have
now
been
replaced
by
large
near
the
mouths
of
shafts
where
every
convenience
is
provided
for
the
men
drying
their
wet
garments
and
washing
their
persons
on
coming
to
the
surface
having
changed
their
clothes
uncle
and
nephew
hastened
to
just
where
they
dwelt
in
the
cottage
of
maggot
the
blacksmith
this
man
who
has
already
been
introduced
to
the
reader
was
to
david
and
father
to
zackey
when
david
trevarrow
entered
his
cottage
and
told
him
of
his
bad
fortune
and
of
his
resolution
to
try
his
luck
next
day
in
the
higher
mine
little
did
he
imagine
that
his
change
of
purpose
was
to
be
the
first
step
in
a
succession
of
causes
which
were
destined
to
result
at
no
very
distant
period
in
great
changes
of
fortune
to
some
of
his
friends
in
just
as
well
as
to
many
others
in
the
county
chapter
five
describes
a
wreck
and
some
of
its
consequences
while
the
miner
had
been
pursuing
his
toilsome
work
in
the
solitude
and
silence
of
the
level
under
the
sea
as
already
described
a
noble
ship
was
leaping
over
the
atlantic
waves
homeward
bound
to
old
england
she
was
an
under
sails
and
although
she
bent
low
before
the
gale
so
that
the
waves
almost
curled
over
her
lee
bulwarks
she
rose
buoyantly
like
a
seagull
for
she
was
a
good
ship
stout
of
plank
and
sound
of
timber
with
sails
and
cordage
to
match
naturally
in
such
a
storm
those
on
board
were
anxious
for
they
knew
that
they
were
drawing
near
to
land
and
that
dear
old
england
had
an
ugly
seaboard
in
these
parts
a
coast
not
to
be
too
closely
hugged
in
what
the
captain
styled
dirty
weather
with
a
whole
gale
from
the
so
a
good
lookout
was
kept
sharp
eyes
were
in
the
foretop
looking
out
for
the
guiding
rays
of
the
lighthouse
which
illumine
that
part
of
our
rocky
shores
to
warn
the
mariner
of
danger
and
direct
him
to
a
safe
harbour
the
captain
stood
on
the
with
stern
gaze
and
compressed
lip
the
chart
had
been
consulted
the
bearings
correctly
noted
calculations
made
and
leeway
allowed
for
everything
in
fact
that
could
be
done
by
a
commander
who
knew
his
duty
had
been
done
for
the
safety
of
the
ship
so
would
the
captain
have
said
probably
had
he
lived
to
be
questioned
as
to
the
management
of
his
vessel
but
everything
had
been
done
the
lead
strange
to
say
had
not
been
hove
it
was
ready
to
heave
but
the
order
was
delayed
unaccountable
fatality
the
only
safe
guide
that
remained
to
the
good
ship
on
that
wild
night
was
held
in
abeyance
it
was
deemed
unnecessary
to
heave
it
yet
or
it
was
troublesome
and
they
would
wait
till
nearer
the
land
no
one
now
can
tell
the
reasons
that
influenced
the
captain
but
lead
was
not
owing
to
similar
delay
or
neglect
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
ships
have
been
lost
and
thousands
of
human
lives
have
been
sacrificed
the
ship
passed
like
a
dark
phantom
over
the
very
head
of
the
miner
who
was
at
work
many
fathoms
below
the
bottom
of
the
sea
land
ho
came
suddenly
in
a
fierce
quick
shout
from
the
starboard
starboard
hard
cried
the
captain
as
the
roar
of
breakers
ahead
rose
above
the
yelling
of
the
storm
before
the
order
was
obeyed
or
another
word
spoken
the
ship
struck
and
a
shriek
of
human
terror
followed
as
the
foremast
went
by
the
board
with
a
fearful
crash
the
waves
burst
over
the
stern
sweeping
the
decks
fore
and
aft
wave
after
wave
lifted
the
great
ship
as
though
it
had
been
a
child
toy
and
dashed
her
down
upon
the
rocks
her
bottom
was
stove
in
her
planks
and
timbers
were
riven
like
matchwood
far
down
below
man
was
destroying
the
flinty
rock
while
overhead
the
rock
was
destroying
the
handiwork
of
man
but
the
destruction
in
the
one
case
was
slow
in
the
other
swift
a
desperate
but
futile
effort
was
made
by
the
crew
to
get
out
the
boats
and
the
passengers
many
of
whom
were
women
and
children
rushed
frantically
from
the
cabin
to
the
deck
and
clung
to
anything
they
could
lay
hold
of
until
strength
failed
and
the
waves
tore
them
away
one
man
there
was
in
the
midst
of
all
the
crew
who
retained
his
in
that
dread
hour
he
was
a
tall
stern
old
man
with
silver
locks
an
indian
merchant
one
who
had
spent
his
youth
and
manhood
in
the
wealthy
land
collecting
gold
making
a
fortune
he
was
wont
to
say
and
who
was
returning
to
his
fatherland
to
spend
it
he
was
a
thinking
and
calculating
man
and
in
the
anticipation
of
some
such
catastrophe
as
had
actually
overtaken
him
he
had
secured
some
of
his
most
costly
jewels
in
a
linen
belt
this
belt
while
others
were
rushing
to
the
boats
the
old
man
secured
round
his
waist
and
then
sprang
on
deck
to
be
swept
with
a
dozen
of
his
into
the
sea
by
the
next
wave
that
struck
the
doomed
vessel
there
was
no
one
on
that
rugged
coast
to
lend
a
helping
hand
lifeboats
did
not
then
as
now
nestle
in
little
nooks
on
every
part
of
our
dangerous
coasts
no
eye
was
there
to
see
nor
ear
to
hear
when
twenty
minutes
after
she
struck
the
went
to
pieces
and
those
of
her
crew
and
passengers
who
had
retained
their
hold
of
her
uttered
their
last
despairing
cry
and
their
souls
returned
to
god
who
gave
them
it
is
a
solemn
thought
that
man
may
with
such
awful
suddenness
and
so
unexpectedly
be
summoned
into
the
presence
of
his
maker
thrice
happy
they
who
when
their
hearts
grow
chill
and
their
grasps
relax
as
the
last
plank
is
rending
can
say
neither
death
nor
life
nor
any
other
creature
is
able
to
separate
us
from
the
love
of
god
which
is
in
christ
jesus
our
lord
the
scene
we
have
described
was
soon
over
and
the
rich
cargo
of
the
was
cast
upon
the
sea
and
strewn
upon
the
shore
affording
much
work
for
many
days
to
the
coastguard
and
greatly
exciting
the
people
of
the
district
most
of
whom
appeared
to
entertain
an
earnest
belief
in
the
doctrine
that
everything
cast
by
storms
upon
their
coast
ought
to
be
considered
public
property
portions
of
the
wreck
had
the
name
trident
painted
on
them
and
letters
found
in
several
chests
which
were
washed
ashore
proved
that
the
ship
had
sailed
from
calcutta
and
was
bound
for
the
port
of
london
one
little
boy
alone
escaped
the
waves
he
was
found
in
a
crevice
of
the
cliffs
the
following
day
with
just
enough
vitality
left
to
give
a
few
details
of
the
wreck
although
all
possible
care
was
bestowed
on
him
he
died
before
night
thus
sudden
and
complete
was
the
end
of
as
fine
a
ship
as
ever
spread
her
canvas
to
the
breeze
at
night
she
had
been
full
of
life
full
of
wealth
in
the
morning
she
was
gone
only
a
few
bales
and
casks
and
broken
spars
to
represent
the
wealth
and
stiffened
corpses
to
tell
of
the
life
departed
so
she
came
and
went
and
in
a
short
time
all
remnants
of
her
were
carried
away
one
morning
a
few
weeks
after
the
night
of
the
storm
maggot
the
smith
turned
himself
in
his
bed
at
an
early
hour
and
feeling
disinclined
to
slumber
got
up
to
look
at
the
state
of
the
weather
the
sun
was
just
rising
and
there
was
an
inviting
look
about
the
morning
which
induced
the
man
to
dress
hastily
and
go
out
maggot
was
a
man
rough
in
his
outer
aspect
as
well
as
in
his
inner
man
but
by
no
means
what
is
usually
termed
a
bad
man
although
morally
speaking
he
could
not
claim
to
be
considered
a
good
one
in
fact
he
was
a
hearty
jolly
reckless
fisherman
with
warm
feelings
enthusiastic
temperament
and
no
principle
a
man
who
though
very
ready
to
do
a
kind
act
had
no
particular
objection
to
do
one
that
was
decidedly
objectionable
when
it
suited
his
purpose
or
served
his
present
interest
he
was
regarded
by
his
comrades
as
one
of
the
greatest
madcaps
in
the
district
old
maggot
was
as
we
have
said
a
blacksmith
to
trade
but
he
had
also
been
bred
a
miner
and
was
something
of
a
fisherman
as
well
besides
being
like
most
of
his
companions
an
inveterate
smuggler
he
could
turn
his
hand
to
almost
anything
and
was
everything
by
turns
but
nothing
long
sauntering
down
to
priests
cove
on
the
south
of
cape
cornwall
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
stuck
carelessly
on
his
shaggy
head
he
fell
in
with
a
comrade
whom
he
hailed
by
the
name
of
john
cock
this
man
was
also
a
fisherman
and
the
bosom
friend
and
admirer
of
maggot
where
bound
to
this
mornin
jack
inquired
maggot
to
fish
replied
john
i
go
with
booy
said
maggot
this
was
the
extent
of
the
conversation
at
that
time
they
were
not
communicative
but
walked
side
by
side
in
silence
to
the
beach
where
they
launched
their
little
boat
and
rowed
out
to
sea
presently
john
cock
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
exclaimed
maggot
i
see
summat
do
iss
do
i
what
do
un
look
like
like
a
dead
aw
my
dear
said
maggot
lev
us
keep
away
it
can
do
no
good
to
we
acting
on
this
opinion
the
men
rowed
past
the
object
that
was
floating
on
the
sea
and
soon
after
began
to
fish
but
they
had
not
fished
long
when
the
dead
body
drifted
probably
by
some
appeared
close
to
them
again
seeing
this
they
changed
their
position
but
ere
long
the
body
again
appeared
observed
maggot
there
somethin
in
its
pockets
as
the
same
idea
had
occurred
to
john
cock
the
men
resolved
to
examine
the
body
so
they
rowed
up
to
it
and
found
it
to
be
that
of
an
elderly
man
much
decomposed
and
nearly
naked
a
very
short
examination
sufficed
to
show
that
the
pockets
of
such
garments
as
were
still
upon
it
were
empty
and
the
men
were
about
to
let
it
go
again
when
maggot
exclaimed
hold
fast
jack
i
see
somethin
tied
round
the
waist
of
he
a
sort
belt
it
do
seem
the
belt
was
quickly
removed
and
the
body
released
when
it
sank
with
a
heavy
plunge
but
ere
long
reappeared
on
the
surface
the
fishermen
rowed
a
considerable
distance
away
from
it
and
then
shipped
their
oars
and
examined
the
belt
which
was
made
of
linen
maggot
sliced
it
up
as
he
would
have
ripped
up
a
fish
and
laid
bare
to
the
astonished
gaze
of
himself
and
his
friend
a
number
of
glittering
gems
of
various
colours
neatly
and
firmly
embedded
in
cotton
besides
a
variety
of
rings
and
small
brooches
set
with
precious
stones
now
i
tell
said
maggot
is
like
as
this
here
will
make
our
fortin
or
else

we
into
trouble
why

go

stuff
round
his
waist
to
drown
hisself
with
i
do
know
if
they
wor
real
lev
us
car
to
maister
donnithorne
john
cock
replied
with
a
nod
and
the
two
men
packing
up
the
jewels
pulled
as
fast
as
possible
hauling
their
boat
beyond
the
reach
of
the
surf
they
hastened
to
just
and
requested
a
private
audience
of
mr
donnithorne
see
note
that
excellent
gentleman
was
not
unaccustomed
to
give
private
audiences
to
fishermen
and
as
has
been
already
hinted
at
the
beginning
of
this
tale
was
reported
to
have
private
dealings
with
them
also
of
a
very
questionable
nature
he
received
the
two
men
however
with
the
hearty
air
of
a
man
who
knows
that
the
suspicions
entertained
of
him
by
the
calumnious
world
are
false
well
maggot
said
mr
donnithorne
what
is
your
business
with
me
you
are
not
wont
to
be
astir
so
early
if
all
be
true
that
is
reported
of
plaise
sur
said
maggot
with
a
glance
at
rose
ellis
who
sat
sewing
near
the
window
i
come
to
talk
private
matters
if
leave
us
rose
dear
for
a
little
said
the
old
gentleman
as
soon
as
she
was
out
of
the
room
maggot
locked
the
door
a
proceeding
which
surprised
mr
donnithorne
not
a
little
but
his
surprise
was
much
greater
when
the
man
drew
a
small
parcel
from
the
breast
of
his
rough
coat
and
unrolling
it
displayed
the
glittering
jewels
of
which
he
had
so
unexpectedly
become
possessed
where
got
you
these
inquired
mr
donnithorne
turning
them
over
carefully
got
in
the
say
catched
sure
said
maggot
not
with
a
baited
hook
i
warrant
said
the
old
gentleman
come
my
son
let
hear
all
about
it
maggot
explained
how
he
had
obtained
the
jewels
and
then
asked
what
they
were
worth
i
ca
tell
that
said
mr
donnithorne
shaking
his
head
gravely
some
of
them
are
undoubtedly
of
value
the
others
for
all
i
know
may
not
be
worth
much
come
now
sur
said
maggot
with
a
confidential
leer
it
not
the
fust
time
we
have
done
a
bit
o
business
i
i
cud
claim
salvage
on
i
do
know
that
said
the
old
gentleman
you
can
not
tell
whom
they
belonged
to
and
i
suspect
government
would
claim
them
if
but
by
the
way
i
suppose
you
found
no
letters
nothing
in
the
shape
of
writing
on
the
body
nothin
whatsomever
well
then
i
fear
that
come
now
sur
said
maggot
boldly
you
gives
john
and
me
ten
pounds
apaice
an
kape
to
yourself
to
make
what
can
of
mr
donnithorne
shook
his
head
and
hesitated
often
before
had
he
defrauded
the
revenue
by
knowingly
purchasing
smuggled
brandy
and
tobacco
and
by
providing
the
funds
to
enable
others
to
smuggle
them
but
then
the
morality
of
that
day
in
regard
to
smuggling
was
very
lax
and
there
were
men
who
although
in
all
other
matters
truly
honest
and
upright
could
not
be
convinced
of
the
sinfulness
of
smuggling
and
smiled
when
they
were
charged
with
the
practice
but
who
nevertheless
would
have
scorned
to
steal
or
tell
a
downright
lie
this
however
was
a
very
different
matter
from
smuggling
the
old
gentleman
shrank
from
it
at
first
and
could
not
meet
the
gaze
of
the
smuggler
with
his
usual
bold
frank
look
but
the
temptation
was
great
the
jewels
he
suspected
were
of
immense
value
and
his
heart
readily
replied
to
the
objections
raised
by
his
conscience
that
after
all
there
was
no
one
left
to
claim
them
and
he
had
a
much
better
right
to
them
in
equity
if
not
in
law
than
government
and
as
to
the
fellows
who
found
them
why
the
sum
they
asked
would
be
a
great
and
rich
windfall
to
them
besides
freeing
them
from
all
further
trouble
as
well
as
transferring
any
risk
that
might
accrue
from
their
shoulders
to
his
own
while
the
old
gentleman
was
reasoning
thus
with
himself
maggot
stood
anxiously
watching
his
countenance
and
twisting
the
cloth
that
had
enclosed
the
jewellery
into
a
tight
rope
as
he
shifted
his
position
uneasily
at
length
old
mr
donnithorne
said
leave
the
jewels
with
me
and
call
again
in
an
hour
from
this
time
you
shall
then
have
my
answer
maggot
and
his
friend
consented
to
this
delay
and
left
the
room
no
sooner
were
they
gone
than
the
old
gentleman
called
his
wife
who
naturally
exclaimed
in
great
surprise
on
beholding
the
table
covered
with
such
costly
trinkets
where
did
you
get
these
tom
mr
donnithorne
explained
and
then
asked
what
she
thought
of
proposal
refuse
it
said
she
firmly
but
my
dear
do
about
it
tom
whenever
a
man
begins
to
with
sin
it
is
sure
to
butt
him
over
on
his
back
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
say
but
my
dear
it
is
not
dishonest
i
do
know
that
interrupted
mrs
donnithorne
vigorously
you
think
that
smuggling
is
not
dishonest
but
i
do
and
so
does
the
minister
what
care
for
the
minister
cried
the
old
gentleman
losing
his
temper
who
made
judge
of
my
doings
he
is
an
expounder
of
god
word
said
mrs
donnithorne
firmly
and
holds
that
shalt
not
steal
is
one
of
the
ten
commandments
well
well
he
and
i
do
agree
that
all
besides
has
he
never
expounded
to
you
that
obedience
to
your
husband
is
a
virtue
a
commandment
i
may
say
which
you
are
mr
donnithorne
said
the
lady
with
dignity
i
am
here
at
your
request
and
am
now
complying
with
your
wishes
in
giving
my
opinion
there
there
molly
said
the
subdued
husband
giving
his
better
half
a
kiss
do
be
so
sharp
you
ought
to
have
been
a
lawyer
with
your
powerful
reasoning
capacity
however
let
me
tell
you
that
you
understand
these
matters
then
why
ask
my
advice
tom
why
woman
because
an
inexplicable
fatality
leads
me
to
consult
you
although
i
know
well
enough
what
the
upshot
will
be
but
i
resolved
to
close
with
maggot
i
knew
you
would
said
mrs
donnithorne
quietly
the
last
remark
was
the
had
the
good
lady
condescended
to
be
in
her
entreaties
that
the
bargain
should
not
be
concluded
it
is
highly
probable
her
husband
would
have
given
in
but
her
last
observation
nettled
him
so
much
that
he
immediately
hoisted
a
flag
of
defiance
nailed
it
to
the
mast
and
went
out
in
great
indignation
to
search
for
maggot
that
individual
was
not
far
off
the
bargain
was
completed
the
jewels
were
locked
up
in
one
of
the
old
gentleman
secret
repositories
and
the
fishermen
with
ten
pounds
apiece
in
their
pockets
returned
home
note
it
may
be
well
here
to
inform
the
reader
that
the
finding
of
the
jewels
as
here
described
and
the
consequences
which
followed
are
founded
on
fact
chapter
six
treats
of
the
miner
cottage
work
and
costume
maggot
home
was
a
disordered
one
when
he
reached
it
for
his
youngest
baby
a
fat
little
boy
had
been
seized
with
convulsions
and
his
wife
and
little
daughter
grace
and
son
zackey
and
david
trevarrow
besides
his
next
neighbour
mrs
penrose
with
her
sixteen
children
were
all
in
the
room
doing
their
best
by
means
of
useless
or
hurtful
applications
equally
useless
advice
and
intolerable
noise
and
confusion
to
cure
if
not
to
kill
the
baby
maggot
cottage
was
a
poor
one
his
furniture
was
mean
and
there
was
not
much
of
it
nevertheless
its
inmates
were
proud
of
it
for
they
lived
in
comparative
comfort
there
mrs
maggot
was
a
active
woman
and
her
husband
despite
his
smuggling
propensities
was
an
affectionate
father
usually
the
cottage
was
kept
in
a
most
orderly
condition
but
on
the
present
occasion
it
was
as
we
have
said
in
a
state
of
great
confusion
fetch
me
a
bit
of
rag
grace
cried
mrs
maggot
just
as
her
husband
entered
here
a
bit
old
said
maggot
handing
her
the
linen
cloth
in
which
the
jewels
had
been
wrapped
up
and
which
he
had
unconsciously
retained
in
his
hands
on
quitting
mr
donnithorne
run
my
dear
man
he
added
turning
to
john
cock
an
fetch
the
noo
doctor
john
darted
away
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
returned
with
oliver
trembath
who
found
that
the
baby
had
weathered
the
storm
by
the
force
of
its
own
constitution
despite
the
adverse
influences
that
were
around
it
he
therefore
contented
himself
with
clearing
the
place
of
intruders
and
prescribing
some
simple
medicine
are
you
going
to
work
inquired
oliver
of
david
trevarrow
observing
that
the
man
was
about
to
quit
the
cottage
iss
sur
to
botallack
then
i
will
accompany
you
captain
dan
is
going
to
show
me
over
part
of
the
mine
mrs
maggot
and
remember
my
directions
if
this
should
happen
to
the
little
fellow
again
leaving
the
cottage
the
two
proceeded
through
the
town
to
the
north
end
of
it
accompanied
by
maggot
who
said
he
was
going
to
the
forge
to
do
a
bit
of
work
and
who
parted
from
them
at
the
outskirts
of
the
town
times
are
bad
with
you
at
the
mines
just
now
i
find
said
oliver
as
they
walked
along
iss
sur
they
are
replied
trevarrow
in
the
quiet
tone
that
was
peculiar
to
him
but
thank
god
we
do
manage
to
live
though
there
are
some
of
us
with
a
lot
o
as
finds
it
hard
work
the
bal
the
mine
ai
so
good
as
she
once
was
i
suppose
that
you
have
frequent
changes
of
fortune
said
oliver
the
miner
admitted
that
this
was
the
case
for
that
sometimes
a
man
worked
underground
for
several
weeks
without
getting
enough
to
keep
his
family
while
at
other
times
he
might
come
on
a
bunch
of
copper
or
tin
which
would
enable
him
to
clear
pounds
or
more
in
a
month
if
report
says
truly
observed
oliver
you
have
hit
upon
a
lode
as
you
call
it
not
many
days
ago
a
do
look
very
well
now
sur
replied
the
miner
but
wan
can
never
tell
i
did
work
for
weeks
in
the
level
under
the
say
without
success
so
i
guv
it
up
an
went
to
wheal
hazard
and
on
the
back
o
the
level
i
did
strike
a
small
lode
of
tin
so
thick
as
my
finger
it
may
get
better
or
it
may
take
the
bit
in
its
teeth
and
disappear
we
can
not
tell
well
i
wish
you
good
luck
said
oliver
and
here
comes
captain
dan
so
i
bid
you
sur
said
the
and
man
with
a
smile
and
a
nod
as
he
turned
off
towards
the
to
put
on
his
mining
garments
towards
this
house
a
number
of
men
had
been
converging
while
oliver
and
his
companion
approached
it
and
the
former
observed
that
whatever
colour
the
men
might
be
on
entering
it
they
invariably
came
out
light
red
like
lobsters
emerging
from
a
boiling
pot
in
botallack
mine
a
large
quantity
of
iron
is
mingled
with
the
tin
ore
this
colours
everything
in
and
around
the
mine
including
men
clothes
hands
and
faces
with
a
light
the
streams
of
course
are
also
coloured
with
it
and
the
various
pits
and
ponds
for
collecting
the
fluid
mud
of
tin
ore
seem
as
if
filled
with
that
nauseous
compound
known
by
the
name
of
gregory
mixture
in
the
there
were
rows
of
pegs
with
red
garments
hung
thereon
to
dry
and
there
were
numerous
men
dressing
and
undressing
in
every
stage
of
the
process
while
in
a
corner
two
or
three
were
washing
their
bodies
in
a
tank
of
water
these
last
were
men
who
had
been
at
work
all
night
and
were
cleansing
themselves
before
putting
on
what
we
may
term
their
clothes
the
mining
dress
is
a
very
simple
and
often
a
very
ragged
affair
it
consists
of
a
flannel
shirt
a
pair
of
linen
trousers
a
short
coat
of
the
same
and
a
hat
in
the
form
of
a
stiff
but
made
so
thick
as
to
serve
the
purpose
of
a
helmet
to
guard
the
head
from
the
rocks
etcetera
clumsy
complete
the
costume
as
each
man
issued
from
the
house
he
went
to
a
group
of
wooden
chests
which
lay
scattered
about
outside
and
opening
his
own
took
from
it
a
bag
of
powder
some
blasting
fuse
several
iron
tools
which
he
tied
to
a
rope
so
as
to
be
slung
over
his
shoulder
a
small
wooden
canteen
of
water
and
a
bunch
of
tallow
candles
these
last
he
fastened
to
a
button
on
his
breast
having
previously
affixed
one
of
them
to
the
front
of
his
hat
thus
accoutred
they
proceeded
to
a
small
platform
close
at
hand
with
a
square
hole
in
it
out
of
which
protruded
the
head
of
a
ladder
this
was
the
ladder
road
through
the
hole
these
red
men
descended
one
by
one
chatting
and
laughing
as
they
went
and
disappeared
leaving
the
and
all
around
it
a
place
of
solitude
captain
dan
now
prepared
to
descend
this
ladder
road
with
oliver
trembath
chapter
seven
tells
of
the
great
mine
and
of
a
royal
dive
under
the
sea
botallack
to
the
dark
depths
of
which
we
are
now
about
to
descend
is
the
most
celebrated
mine
in
the
great
mining
county
of
cornwall
it
stands
on
the
sea
coast
a
little
more
than
a
mile
to
the
north
of
just
the
region
around
it
is
somewhat
bleak
and
almost
destitute
of
trees
in
approaching
it
the
eyes
of
the
traveller
are
presented
with
a
view
of
and
piles
of
stones
and
rubbish
in
the
midst
of
which
stand
a
number
of
uncouth
yet
picturesque
objects
composed
of
boards
and
timber
wheels
ropes
pulleys
chains
and
suchlike
gear
these
last
are
the
winding
erections
of
the
shafts
which
lead
to
the
various
mines
for
the
whole
region
is
undermined
and
botallack
is
only
one
of
several
in
just
parish
wherever
the
eye
turns
there
in
the
midst
of
green
fields
where
rocks
and
rocky
fences
abound
may
be
seen
rising
prominently
the
labouring
arms
or
bobs
of
the
pump
and
skip
engines
and
the
other
machinery
required
in
mining
operations
while
the
ear
is
assailed
by
the
perpetual
clatter
of
the
stamps
or
machines
which
never
cease
their
din
day
or
night
except
on
sundays
botallack
like
all
the
other
mines
has
several
shafts
or
entrances
to
the
works
below
such
as
boscawen
shaft
wheal
button
wheal
hazard
chicornish
shaft
davis
shaft
wheal
cock
etcetera
the
most
interesting
of
which
are
situated
among
the
steep
rugged
cliffs
that
front
and
bid
defiance
to
the
utmost
fury
of
the
atlantic
ocean
from
whatever
point
viewed
the
aspect
of
botallack
mine
is
grand
in
the
extreme
on
the
rocky
point
that
stretches
out
into
the
sea
engines
with
all
their
fantastic
machinery
and
buildings
have
been
erected
on
the
very
summit
of
the
cliff
is
seen
a
complication
of
timbers
wheels
and
chains
sharply
defined
against
the
sky
with
apparently
scarce
any
hold
of
the
cliff
while
down
below
on
rocky
ledges
and
in
black
chasms
are
other
engines
and
beams
and
rods
and
wheels
and
chains
fastened
and
perched
in
fantastic
forms
in
places
here
amid
the
most
savage
gorges
of
the
sea
and
riven
rocks
half
clinging
to
the
land
half
suspended
over
the
water
is
perched
the
machinery
of
and
entrance
to
the
most
singular
shaft
of
the
mine
named
the
boscawen
diagonal
shaft
this
shaft
descends
under
the
sea
at
a
steep
incline
it
is
traversed
on
rails
by
an
iron
carriage
called
the
gig
which
is
lowered
and
drawn
up
by
steam
power
starting
as
it
does
from
an
elevated
position
in
the
rocks
that
are
close
to
the
edge
of
the
sea
and
slanting
down
through
the
cape
or
seaward
this
vehicle
descends
only
a
few
fathoms
when
it
is
the
ocean
and
then
its
further
course
is
far
out
and
deep
down
about
of
a
mile
out
and
full
fathoms
down
the
gig
conveys
the
men
to
and
from
their
work
the
ore
being
drawn
up
by
another
iron
carriage
there
is
or
rather
there
was
before
the
brake
was
added
danger
attending
the
descent
of
this
shaft
for
the
rope
although
good
and
strong
is
not
immaculate
as
was
proved
terribly
in
the
year
when
it
broke
and
the
gig
flew
down
to
the
bottom
like
lightning
dashing
itself
to
pieces
and
instantly
killing
the
nine
unfortunate
men
who
were
descending
at
the
time
nevertheless
the
prince
and
princess
of
wales
did
not
shrink
from
descending
this
deep
burrow
under
the
sea
in
the
year
it
was
a
great
day
for
just
and
botallack
that
of
july
on
which
the
royal
visit
was
paid
great
were
the
expectation
and
preparation
on
all
hands
to
give
a
hearty
welcome
to
the
royal
pair
the
ladies
arrayed
themselves
in
their
best
to
do
fitting
honour
to
the
princess
the
balmaidens
donned
their
and
johnny
fortnight
see
note
took
care
by
supplying
the
poor
with
the
latest
fashions
that
their
appearance
should
be
if
we
may
be
allowed
the
word
the
volunteers
too
turned
out
in
force
and
no
one
looking
at
their
trim
soldierly
aspect
could
have
believed
them
to
be
the
same
miners
who
were
wont
to
emerge
each
evening
through
a
hole
in
the
earth
red
as
lobsters
wet
ragged
and
befouled
in
a
word
surrounded
by
a
halo
of
dishevelment
indicative
of
their
rugged
toils
in
the
regions
below
everywhere
the
people
turned
out
to
line
the
roads
and
worthily
receive
the
expected
visitors
and
great
was
the
cheering
when
they
arrived
accompanied
by
the
duke
and
duchess
of
sutherland
the
earl
of
mount
edgecumbe
lady
de
grey
lord
and
lady
vivian
general
knollys
and
others
but
louder
still
was
the
cheer
when
the
princess
rode
down
the
steep
descent
to
the
cliffs
in
a
the
botallack
cliffs
themselves
however
were
the
central
point
not
only
of
the
interest
but
of
the
grandeur
of
the
scene
for
here
were
presented
such
a
view
and
combination
as
are
not
often
witnessed
nature
in
one
of
her
wildest
aspects
combined
with
innumerable
multitudes
of
human
beings
swayed
by
one
feeling
of
enthusiastic
loyalty
above
on
every
attainable
point
projection
and
eminence
men
and
women
clustered
like
gay
flies
on
the
giant
cliffs
leaving
immense
gaps
here
and
there
where
no
foot
might
venture
save
that
of
a
bird
midway
on
the
face
of
the
precipice
clung
the
great
beams
and
supports
of
the
boscawen
diagonal
shaft
with
the
little
gig
perched
on
them
and
the
royal
party
seated
therein
facing
the
entrance
to
the
black
abyss
the
princess
arrayed
in
a
white
flannel
cloak
trimmed
with
blue
and
a
straw
hat
with
a
blue
ribbon
round
it
and
the
prince
clad
in
miner
costume
underneath
a
dizzy
depth
to
gaze
down
lay
the
rugged
boulders
of
the
shore
with
the
spray
of
the
atlantic
springing
over
them
deafening
was
the
cheer
when
the
gig
at
last
entered
the
shaft
and
disappeared
and
intense
the
anxiety
of
the
vast
multitude
as
they
watched
the
descent
in
imagination
of
course
for
nothing
could
be
seen
but
the
tight
uncoiling
its
endless
length
and
disappearing
like
a
thin
snake
down
the
jaws
of
some
awful
that
had
climbed
so
far
up
the
cliffs
to
meet
and
devour
it
now
they
are
at
the
shore
now
passing
under
the
sea
fairly
under
it
by
this
time
a
few
minutes
more
and
they
have
reached
the
spot
where
yonder
seagull
is
now
wheeling
above
the
waves
wondering
what
new
species
of
bird
has
taken
possession
of
its
native
cliffs
five
minutes
are
passed
yet
still
descending
rapidly
they
must
be
half
a
mile
out
from
the
land
now
half
of
a
mile
out
on
the
first
part
of
a
submarine
tunnel
to
america
old
england
is
on
the
lee
but
they
are
very
much
the
reverse
of
afloat
solid
rock
is
above
on
either
side
and
below
so
close
to
them
that
the
elbows
must
not
be
allowed
to
protrude
over
the
edge
of
their
car
nor
the
head
be
held
too
high
here
even
royalty
must
stoop
not
that
we
would
be
understood
to
imply
that
royalty
can
not
stoop
elsewhere
those
who
dwell
in
highland
cottages
could
contradict
us
if
we
did
presently
the
rope
slows
the
lower
depths
are
reached
and
now
for
some
time
there
is
patient
waiting
for
it
is
understood
that
they
are
examining
the
levels
where
the
stout
men
of
cornwall
tear
out
the
solid
rock
in
quest
of
copper
and
tin
after
a
time
the
thin
snake
begins
to
ascend
they
are
coming
up
now
but
not
so
fast
as
they
went
down
it
is
about
ten
minutes
before
the
gig
emerges
from
that
black
hole
and
bears
the
prince
and
princess
once
more
into
the
light
of
day
yes
it
was
a
great
day
for
botallack
and
it
will
dwell
long
in
the
memories
of
those
who
witnessed
it
especially
of
that
fortunate
captain
of
the
mine
who
had
the
honour
of
conducting
the
princess
on
the
occasion
and
of
whose
enthusiasm
in
recalling
the
event
and
in
commenting
on
her
intelligence
and
condescension
we
can
speak
from
personal
observation
but
reader
you
will
say
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
our
story
nothing
we
admit
it
frankly
nothing
whatever
in
a
direct
way
nevertheless
indirectly
the
narrative
may
possibly
arouse
in
you
greater
interest
in
the
mine
down
which
we
are
about
to
conduct
you
not
by
the
same
route
as
that
taken
by
the
prince
and
princess
for
the
boscawen
shaft
did
not
exist
at
the
period
of
our
tale
but
by
one
much
more
difficult
and
dangerous
as
you
shall
see
before
we
go
however
permit
us
to
add
to
the
offence
of
digression
by
wandering
still
further
out
of
our
direct
road
there
are
a
few
facts
regarding
botallack
and
mining
operations
without
a
knowledge
of
which
you
will
be
apt
at
times
to
misunderstand
your
position
let
us
suppose
that
a
mine
has
been
already
opened
that
a
lode
that
is
a
vein
of
quartz
with
metal
in
it
has
been
discovered
cropping
out
of
the
earth
and
that
it
has
been
dug
down
upon
from
above
and
dug
in
upon
from
the
a
shaft
has
been
sunk
in
other
words
a
hole
excavated
let
us
say
two
or
three
hundred
yards
inland
to
a
depth
of
some
forty
or
fifty
fathoms
near
the
this
shaft
is
perhaps
nine
feet
by
six
wide
the
lode
being
a
layer
of
quartz
sometimes
slopes
one
way
sometimes
another
and
is
occasionally
perpendicular
it
also
varies
in
its
run
or
direction
a
little
here
and
there
like
a
wildish
horse
being
sometimes
met
by
other
lodes
which
like
bad
companions
divert
it
from
the
straight
course
unlike
bad
companions
however
they
increase
its
value
at
the
point
of
meeting
by
thickening
it
whatever
course
the
lode
takes
the
miner
conscientiously
follows
suit
his
shaft
slopes
much
little
or
not
at
all
according
to
the
lie
of
the
lode
it
is
an
ancient
truism
that
water
must
find
its
level
owing
to
this
law
much
water
accumulates
in
the
shaft
obliging
the
miner
to
erect
an
and
provide
a
powerful
with
all
its
gear
at
immense
cost
to
keep
the
works
dry
as
he
proceeds
he
then
goes
to
the
shore
and
there
in
the
face
of
the
perpendicular
cliff
a
little
above
the
he
cuts
a
horizontal
tunnel
about
six
feet
high
by
three
broad
and
continues
to
chisel
and
blast
away
the
solid
rock
until
he
drives
his
tunnel
a
quarter
of
a
mile
inland
which
he
will
do
at
a
rate
varying
from
two
to
six
feet
per
week
according
to
the
hardness
of
the
rock
until
he
reaches
the
shaft
and
thus
provides
an
easy
and
inexpensive
passage
for
the
water
without
pumping
this
tunnel
or
level
he
calls
the
adit
level
but
his
is
by
no
means
rendered
useless
for
it
has
much
to
do
in
hauling
ore
to
the
surface
etcetera
in
process
of
time
the
miner
works
away
all
the
lode
down
to
the
and
must
sink
the
shaft
deeper
perhaps
ten
or
twenty
fathoms
where
new
levels
are
driven
horizontally
on
the
lode
and
water
accumulates
which
must
be
pumped
up
to
the
adit
level
whence
it
escapes
to
the
sea
thus
down
down
he
goes
sinking
his
shaft
and
driving
his
levels
on
that
is
always
following
the
lode
of
course
he
must
stop
before
reaching
the
other
side
of
the
world
at
the
present
time
botallack
has
progressed
in
that
direction
to
a
depth
of
fathoms
to
those
who
find
a
difficulty
in
realising
what
depth
that
really
is
we
would
observe
that
it
is
equal
to
more
than
three
and
a
half
times
the
height
of
paul
cathedral
in
london
nearly
four
times
the
height
of
rollox
chimney
in
glasgow
and
considerably
more
than
twice
the
height
from
the
plain
of
arthur
seat
near
edinburgh
when
the
levels
have
been
driven
a
considerable
distance
from
the
shaft
the
air
naturally
becomes
bad
from
want
of
circulation
to
remedy
this
evil
holes
or
short
shafts
called
winzes
are
sunk
at
intervals
from
the
upper
to
the
lower
levels
these
winzes
are
dangerous
traps
for
the
unwary
or
careless
extending
frequently
to
a
depth
of
ten
or
fifteen
fathoms
and
being
bridged
across
by
one
or
two
loose
planks
ladders
are
fixed
in
many
of
them
to
facilitate
progress
through
the
mine
when
a
miner
drives
the
end
of
his
level
so
far
that
the
air
will
not
circulate
a
new
winze
is
usually
sunk
down
to
him
from
the
level
above
the
circulation
is
thus
extended
and
the
levels
progress
further
and
further
right
and
left
until
they
occupy
miles
of
ground
the
levels
and
shafts
of
botallack
if
put
together
would
extend
to
not
less
than
forty
miles
and
the
superficial
space
of
ground
on
and
beneath
which
the
mine
lies
is
above
acres
when
the
lode
is
rich
and
extends
upwards
or
downwards
it
is
cut
away
from
between
levels
in
a
regular
systematic
manner
strong
beams
being
placed
to
support
temporary
platforms
on
which
the
miners
may
stand
and
work
as
they
ascend
when
they
have
cut
all
the
lode
away
up
to
the
level
above
them
a
false
timber
bottom
is
made
to
replace
the
rocky
bottom
of
the
level
which
is
being
removed
thus
in
traversing
the
old
workings
of
a
mine
one
suddenly
comes
to
great
caverns
very
narrow
but
of
such
immense
height
above
and
depth
below
that
the
rays
of
your
candle
can
not
penetrate
the
darkness
in
such
places
the
thick
short
beams
that
were
used
by
the
old
miners
are
seen
extending
from
side
to
side
of
the
empty
space
disappearing
in
dim
perspective
woe
betide
the
man
who
stumbles
off
his
narrow
plank
or
sets
his
foot
on
an
insecure
beam
in
such
places
where
such
workings
are
in
progress
the
positions
of
the
miners
appear
singularly
wild
and
insecure
the
men
stand
in
the
narrow
chasm
between
the
granite
walls
above
each
heads
slight
temporary
platforms
alone
preserving
them
from
certain
death
and
the
candles
of
those
highest
above
you
twinkling
like
stars
in
a
black
sky
in
these
underground
regions
of
botallack
above
three
hundred
men
and
boys
are
employed
some
of
whom
work
occasionally
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
on
the
surface
about
two
hundred
men
women
and
boys
are
employed
dressing
the
ore
etcetera
other
mines
there
are
in
the
great
mining
centres
of
cornwall
redruth
just
austell
and
helston
which
are
well
worthy
of
note
some
of
them
a
little
deeper
and
some
richer
than
botallack
but
we
profess
not
to
treat
of
all
the
cornish
mines
our
object
is
to
describe
one
as
a
type
of
many
if
not
all
and
as
this
one
runs
farthest
out
beneath
the
sea
is
deeper
than
most
of
the
others
and
richer
than
many
besides
having
interesting
associations
and
being
of
venerable
antiquity
we
hold
it
to
be
the
one
most
worthy
of
selection
with
a
few
briefly
stated
facts
we
shall
take
final
leave
of
statistics
as
we
have
said
the
boscawen
shaft
measures
fathoms
the
by
which
the
men
ascend
and
descend
daily
extends
to
fathoms
it
takes
a
man
half
an
hour
to
reach
the
bottom
and
fully
an
hour
to
climb
to
the
surface
there
are
three
pumping
and
seven
winding
engines
at
work
the
largest
being
of
the
tin
raised
is
from
to
tons
a
month
the
price
of
tin
has
varied
from
pounds
to
pounds
per
ton
in
time
past
when
botallack
was
more
of
a
copper
than
a
a
fathom
has
been
known
to
yield
pounds
worth
of
ore
and
a
miner
has
sometimes
broken
out
as
much
as
pounds
worth
in
one
month
the
mine
has
been
worked
from
time
immemorial
it
is
known
to
have
been
wrought
a
hundred
years
before
it
was
taken
by
the
present
company
who
have
had
it
between
thirty
and
forty
years
and
under
the
able
direction
of
the
present
manager
and
purser
mr
stephen
harvey
james
it
has
paid
the
shareholders
more
than
pounds
the
profit
in
the
year
was
pounds
at
the
termination
of
one
period
of
working
it
left
a
profit
of
pounds
it
has
experienced
many
vicissitudes
of
fortune
formerly
it
was
worked
for
tin
and
at
one
period
was
doing
so
badly
that
it
was
about
to
be
abandoned
when
an
unlooked
for
discovery
of
copper
was
made
and
a
period
of
great
prosperity
again
set
in
during
which
many
shareholders
and
miners
made
their
fortunes
out
of
botallack
thus
much
with
a
humble
apology
we
present
to
the
reader
and
now
resume
the
thread
of
our
narrative
note
the
packmen
are
so
styled
because
of
their
visits
being
paid
fortnightly
chapter
eight
down
down
down
before
descending
the
mine
captain
dan
led
oliver
to
the
where
he
bade
him
undress
and
put
on
miner
clothing
i
need
a
biggish
suit
observed
oliver
true
said
captain
dan
we
are
obliged
usually
to
give
visitors
our
smallest
suits
you
are
an
exception
to
the
rule
indeed
i
not
sure
that
i
have
a
pair
of
trousers
big
enough
for
ah
yes
by
the
way
here
is
a
pair
belonging
to
one
of
our
captains
who
is
unusually
stout
and
tall
i
dare
say
you
be
able
to
squeeze
into
all
right
said
oliver
laughing
as
he
pulled
on
the
red
garments
they
are
wide
enough
round
the
waist
at
all
events
now
for
a
hat
there
said
the
captain
handing
him
a
white
cotton
put
that
on
why
what
this
for
said
oliver
to
keep
from
dirtying
your
head
replied
the
other
as
he
handed
his
companion
a
thick
felt
hat
which
was
extremely
dirty
on
the
front
especially
where
the
candle
was
wont
to
be
fixed
with
wet
clay
now
then
attach
these
two
candles
to
that
button
in
your
breast
and
you
are
not
a
bad
miner
to
look
at
said
captain
dan
with
a
smile
of
approval
the
captain
was
already
equipped
in
underground
costume
and
the
dirty
disreputable
appearance
he
presented
was
thought
oliver
a
wonderful
contrast
to
his
sober
and
gentlemanly
aspect
on
the
evening
of
their
first
meeting
at
his
uncle
table
i
strike
a
light
after
we
get
down
a
bit
so
come
along
said
captain
dan
leaving
the
office
and
leading
the
way
on
reaching
the
entrance
to
the
shaft
oliver
trembath
looked
down
and
observed
a
small
speck
of
bright
light
in
the
black
depths
a
man
coming
up
wait
a
bit
said
the
captain
in
explanation
presently
a
faint
sound
of
slow
footsteps
was
heard
they
grew
gradually
more
distinct
and
ere
long
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
man
emerged
from
the
hole
perspiration
was
trickling
down
his
face
and
painting
him
streakily
with
iron
rust
and
mud
all
his
garments
were
soaking
he
sighed
heavily
on
reaching
the
surface
and
appeared
to
inhale
the
fresh
air
with
great
satisfaction
any
more
coming
no
captain
dan
replied
the
man
glancing
with
some
curiosity
at
the
tall
stranger
now
sir
we
shall
descend
said
the
captain
entering
the
shaft
oliver
followed
and
at
once
plunged
out
of
bright
sunshine
into
subdued
light
a
descent
of
a
few
fathoms
brought
them
to
the
bottom
of
the
first
ladder
it
was
a
short
one
most
of
the
others
the
captain
told
him
were
long
ones
the
width
of
the
shaft
was
about
six
feet
by
nine
it
was
nearly
perpendicular
and
the
slope
of
the
ladders
corresponded
with
its
width
the
head
of
each
resting
against
one
side
of
it
and
the
foot
against
the
other
thus
forming
a
zigzag
of
ladders
all
the
way
down
at
the
foot
of
the
first
ladder
the
light
was
that
of
deep
twilight
here
was
a
wooden
platform
and
a
hole
cut
through
it
out
of
which
protruded
the
head
of
the
second
ladder
the
captain
struck
a
light
and
applying
it
to
one
of
the
candles
affixed
the
same
to
the
front
of
oliver
hat
arranging
his
own
hat
in
a
similar
way
he
continued
the
descent
and
in
a
few
minutes
both
were
beyond
the
region
of
daylight
when
they
had
got
a
short
way
down
probably
the
distance
of
an
ordinary
height
below
the
surface
oliver
looked
up
and
saw
the
little
opening
far
above
him
shining
brightly
like
a
star
a
few
steps
more
and
it
vanished
from
view
he
felt
that
he
had
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
reached
the
regions
of
eternal
night
the
shaft
varied
in
width
here
and
there
in
most
places
it
was
very
narrow
about
six
feet
wide
but
what
with
to
support
the
sides
and
prevent
soft
parts
from
falling
in
and
other
obstructions
the
space
available
for
descent
was
often
not
more
than
enough
to
permit
of
a
man
squeezing
past
a
damp
smell
pervaded
the
air
and
there
was
a
strange
sense
of
contraction
and
confinement
so
to
speak
which
had
at
first
an
unpleasant
effect
on
oliver
the
silence
when
both
men
paused
at
a
to
trim
candles
or
to
rest
a
minute
was
most
profound
and
there
came
over
the
young
doctor
a
sensation
of
being
buried
alive
and
of
having
bid
a
final
farewell
to
the
upper
earth
the
free
air
and
the
sunshine
as
they
went
down
down
down
to
the
depths
below
at
last
they
reached
a
level
or
gallery
by
which
the
communicated
with
the
here
captain
dan
paused
and
trimmed
oliver
candle
which
he
had
thrust
inadvertently
against
a
beam
and
broken
in
two
you
have
to
mind
your
head
here
sir
said
the
captain
with
a
quiet
smile
is
a
good
place
to
learn
humility
oliver
could
scarce
help
laughing
aloud
as
he
gazed
at
his
guide
for
standing
as
he
did
with
the
candle
close
to
his
face
his
cheeks
nose
chin
forehead
and
part
of
the
brim
of
his
hat
and
shoulders
were
brought
into
brilliant
light
while
the
rest
of
him
was
lost
in
the
profound
darkness
of
the
level
behind
and
the
flame
of
his
candle
rested
above
his
head
like
the
diadem
of
some
aristocratic
gnome
how
far
down
have
we
come
inquired
oliver
about
eighty
fathoms
said
the
captain
we
shall
now
go
along
this
level
and
get
into
the
by
which
we
can
descend
to
the
bottom
take
care
of
your
feet
and
head
as
you
go
for
you
be
apt
to
run
against
the
rocks
that
hang
down
and
the
winzes
are
dangerous
and
pray
what
are
winzes
asked
oliver
as
he
stumbled
along
in
the
footsteps
of
his
guide
over
uneven
ground
covered
with
ah
hallo
stop
what
wrong
said
the
captain
looking
back
and
holding
up
his
candle
to
oliver
face
candle
gone
again
captain
i
run
my
head
on
that
rock
lucky
for
me
that
your
mining
hats
are
so
thick
and
hard
for
i
gave
it
a
butt
that
might
have
done
credit
to
an
ox
i
told
you
to
mind
your
head
said
captain
dan
relighting
the
candle
you
had
better
carry
it
in
your
hand
in
the
levels
it
will
light
your
path
better
look
out
now
here
is
a
winze
the
captain
pointed
to
a
black
yawning
hole
about
six
or
seven
feet
in
diameter
which
was
bridged
across
by
a
single
plank
how
deep
does
it
go
asked
the
youth
holding
up
his
candle
and
peering
in
i
ca
see
the
bottom
i
dare
say
not
said
the
captain
for
the
bottom
is
ten
fathoms
down
at
the
next
level
and
are
all
the
winzes
bridged
with
a
single
plank
in
this
way
why
no
some
of
have
two
or
three
planks
but
they
quite
safe
if
you
go
steady
and
pray
how
many
such
winzes
are
there
in
the
mine
asked
oliver
could
say
exactly
without
thinkin
a
bit
replied
the
captain
but
there
are
a
great
number
of
little
short
of
a
hundred
i
should
say
for
we
have
a
good
many
miles
of
levels
in
botallack
which
possesses
an
underground
geography
as
carefully
measured
and
mapped
out
as
that
of
the
surface
and
what
would
happen
asked
oliver
with
an
expression
of
anxiety
if
you
were
to
fall
down
a
winze
and
break
your
neck
and
my
candle
were
to
get
knocked
or
blown
out
leaving
me
to
find
my
way
out
of
a
labyrinth
of
levels
pierced
with
holes
sixty
feet
deep
well
it
hard
to
say
replied
captain
dan
with
much
simplicity
go
on
said
oliver
pursing
his
lips
with
a
grim
smile
as
he
followed
his
leader
across
the
narrow
bridge
captain
dan
continued
his
progress
until
he
reached
the
the
proximity
of
which
was
audibly
announced
by
the
slow
ascent
and
descent
of
a
great
wooden
beam
which
was
styled
the
alongside
and
almost
touching
it
for
space
was
valuable
there
and
had
to
be
economised
was
the
iron
pipe
nearly
a
foot
in
diameter
which
conveyed
the
water
from
the
mine
to
the
adit
level
the
plunge
of
about
ten
feet
in
extent
and
the
sough
or
sigh
of
the
great
beam
with
the
accompanying
gurgle
of
water
in
the
huge
pipe
were
sounds
that
seemed
horribly
appropriate
to
the
subterranean
scene
one
could
have
imagined
the
mine
to
be
a
living
giant
in
the
last
throes
of
death
by
drowning
but
these
were
only
one
half
of
the
peculiarities
of
the
place
on
the
other
side
of
the
shaft
an
arrangement
of
beams
and
partially
broken
boards
formed
the
traversing
ways
or
tube
up
which
were
drawn
the
kibbles
these
last
being
large
iron
buckets
used
for
lifting
ore
to
the
surface
in
the
present
day
machinery
being
more
perfect
the
ancient
kibble
has
been
to
some
extent
supplanted
by
skips
or
small
trucks
with
wheels
in
some
cases
iron
boxes
with
which
are
drawn
up
smoothly
and
without
much
tear
and
wear
but
in
the
rough
times
of
which
we
write
the
sturdy
kibble
used
to
go
rattling
up
the
shaft
with
deafening
noise
dinting
its
thick
sides
and
travelling
with
a
jovial
swing
that
must
have
added
considerably
to
the
debit
side
of
the
account
of
working
expenses
between
the
and
the
there
was
just
room
for
the
ladders
upon
which
captain
dan
followed
by
oliver
now
stepped
this
shaft
was
very
wet
water
dropped
and
spirted
about
in
fine
spray
everywhere
and
the
rounds
of
the
ladders
were
wet
and
greasy
with
slime
it
would
seem
as
though
the
kibbles
had
known
that
a
stranger
was
about
to
descend
and
had
waited
for
him
for
no
sooner
did
oliver
get
on
the
ladder
than
they
began
to
move
the
one
to
ascend
full
and
the
other
to
descend
empty
what
that
exclaimed
oliver
it
only
the
kibbles
replied
captain
dan
before
the
captain
could
explain
what
kibbles
were
these
reckless
buckets
met
with
a
bang
close
to
oliver
cheek
and
rebounded
on
the
beams
that
protected
him
from
their
fury
naturally
the
young
man
shrank
a
little
from
a
noise
so
loud
and
so
near
he
was
at
once
scraped
down
on
the
other
side
by
the
drawing
himself
together
as
much
as
possible
and
feeling
for
once
the
disadvantage
of
being
a
large
man
he
followed
his
leader
down
down
ever
down
into
the
profounder
depths
below
all
this
time
they
had
not
met
with
a
miner
or
with
any
sign
of
human
life
unless
the
pump
and
kibbles
could
be
regarded
as
such
for
they
had
been
hitherto
traversing
the
old
levels
and
workings
of
the
mine
but
at
last
during
one
of
their
pauses
they
heard
the
faint
sound
of
chip
chip
chip
in
the
far
distance
miners
inquired
oliver
captain
dan
nodded
and
said
they
would
now
leave
the
shaft
and
go
to
where
the
men
were
at
work
he
cautioned
his
companion
again
to
have
regard
to
his
head
and
to
mind
his
feet
as
they
proceeded
he
stopped
ever
and
anon
to
point
out
some
object
of
peculiar
interest
there
a
considerable
space
above
and
below
you
here
sir
said
the
captain
stopping
suddenly
in
a
level
which
was
not
more
than
three
feet
wide
oliver
had
been
so
intent
on
his
feet
and
mindful
of
the
winzes
that
he
had
failed
to
observe
the
immense
black
opening
overhead
it
extended
so
high
above
him
and
so
far
forward
and
backward
in
the
direction
of
the
level
that
its
boundaries
were
lost
in
an
immensity
of
profoundly
dark
space
the
rocky
path
was
also
lost
to
view
both
before
and
behind
them
so
that
the
glare
of
their
lights
on
the
metallic
walls
rendered
the
spot
on
which
they
stood
a
point
of
brilliancy
in
the
midst
of
darkness
only
part
of
a
great
beam
was
visible
here
and
there
above
them
as
if
suspended
in
the
gloom
to
render
its
profundity
more
apparent
this
captain
dan
explained
was
the
space
that
had
once
been
occupied
by
a
rich
lode
of
ore
all
of
which
had
been
removed
years
ago
to
the
great
commercial
advantage
of
a
past
generation
soon
after
passing
this
the
captain
paused
at
a
deep
cutting
in
the
rock
and
looking
sadly
at
it
for
a
few
minutes
said
it
was
here
that
poor
trevool
lost
his
life
he
was
a
good
lad
but
careless
and
used
to
go
rattling
along
the
levels
with
his
light
in
his
hat
and
his
thoughts
among
the
stars
instead
of
carrying
the
light
in
his
hand
and
looking
to
his
feet
he
fell
down
that
winze
and
broke
his
back
when
we
got
him
up
to
grass
he
was
alive
but
he
never
spoke
another
word
and
died
the
same
night
poor
fellow
said
oliver
i
suppose
your
men
have
narrow
escapes
sometimes
they
have
sir
but
it
most
always
owin
to
carelessness
there
was
a
cousin
of
that
very
lad
trevool
who
was
buried
with
a
comrade
by
the
falling
in
of
a
shaft
and
came
out
alive
i
was
there
at
the
time
and
helped
to
dig
him
out
captain
dan
here
stopped
and
sticking
his
candle
against
the
wet
wall
of
the
mine
sat
down
on
a
piece
of
rock
while
our
hero
stood
beside
him
you
see
said
he
we
were
sinking
a
shaft
or
rather
reopening
an
old
one
at
the
time
and
harvey
that
was
the
man
name
was
down
working
with
a
comrade
they
came
to
a
soft
bit
o
ground
an
as
they
cut
through
it
they
boarded
it
up
with
timbers
across
to
prevent
it
slipping
but
they
did
the
work
hastily
after
they
had
cut
down
some
fathoms
below
it
the
boarding
gave
way
and
down
the
whole
thing
went
boards
timbers
stones
and
rubbish
on
their
heads
we
made
sure
they
were
dead
but
set
to
nevertheless
to
dig
them
out
as
fast
as
possible
turning
as
many
hands
to
the
work
as
could
get
at
it
at
last
we
came
on
them
and
both
were
alive
and
not
very
much
hurt
the
timbers
and
planks
had
fallen
over
them
in
such
a
way
as
to
keep
the
stones
and
rubbish
off
i
had
a
talk
with
old
harvey
the
other
day
on
this
very
subject
he
told
me
that
he
was
squeezed
flat
against
the
side
of
the
shaft
by
the
rubbish
which
buried
him
and
that
he
did
not
lose
consciousness
for
a
moment
a
large
stone
had
stuck
right
above
his
head
and
this
probably
saved
him
he
heard
us
digging
down
to
him
he
said
and
when
we
got
close
he
sang
out
to
hold
on
as
the
shovel
was
touching
him
sure
enough
this
was
the
case
for
the
next
shovelful
of
rubbish
that
was
lifted
revealed
the
top
of
his
head
we
cleared
the
way
to
his
mouth
as
carefully
as
we
could
and
then
gave
him
a
drop
of
brandy
before
going
on
with
the
work
of
excavation
his
comrade
was
found
in
a
stooping
position
and
was
more
severely
bruised
than
old
harvey
but
both
of
them
lived
to
tell
the
tale
of
their
burial
and
to
thank
god
for
their
deliverance
yes
continued
the
captain
detaching
his
candle
from
the
wall
and
resuming
his
walk
we
have
narrow
escapes
look
here
doctor
did
you
ever
see
a
rock
like
that
captain
dan
pointed
to
a
place
in
the
side
of
the
rocky
wall
which
was
grooved
and
cut
as
if
with
a
huge
gouge
or
chisel
and
highly
polished
it
was
never
cut
by
man
in
that
fashion
we
found
it
as
you
see
it
and
there
many
of
in
the
mine
we
call
slinking
slides
the
marks
must
have
been
caused
when
the
rocks
were
in
a
state
of
partial
fusion
observed
oliver
examining
the
place
with
much
curiosity
i
do
know
as
to
that
sir
said
the
captain
moving
on
but
there
they
are
and
some
of
polished
to
that
extent
you
could
almost
see
your
face
in
on
turning
the
corner
of
a
jutting
rock
a
light
suddenly
appeared
revealing
a
pair
of
large
eyes
and
a
double
row
of
teeth
as
it
were
gleaming
out
of
the
darkness
on
drawing
nearer
this
was
discovered
to
be
a
miner
whose
candle
was
at
some
little
distance
and
only
shone
on
him
partially
well
jack
what
doing
asked
the
captain
the
man
cast
a
disconsolate
look
on
a
large
mass
of
rock
which
lay
in
the
middle
of
the
path
at
his
feet
he
had
been
only
too
successful
in
his
last
blasting
and
had
detached
a
mass
so
large
that
he
could
not
move
it
it
too
hard
for
to
break
captain
dan
better
get
it
into
the
truck
said
the
captain
ca
lift
it
sur
said
the
man
who
grudged
to
go
through
the
tedious
process
of
boring
it
for
a
second
blast
you
must
get
it
out
o
that
jack
at
all
events
it
wo
do
to
let
it
lie
there
said
the
captain
passing
on
and
leaving
the
miner
to
get
out
of
his
difficulty
as
best
he
might
a
few
minutes
more
and
they
came
on
a
pare
of
men
in
other
words
a
band
of
two
or
more
men
working
together
who
were
the
back
of
the
level
as
they
termed
the
process
of
cutting
upwards
into
the
roof
there
a
fellow
in
a
curious
place
said
oliver
peering
up
through
an
irregular
hole
in
which
a
man
was
seen
at
work
standing
on
a
plank
supported
by
a
ladder
he
was
chiselling
with
great
vigour
at
the
rock
over
his
head
and
immediately
beyond
him
another
man
stood
on
a
plank
supported
by
a
beam
of
timber
and
busily
engaged
in
a
similar
occupation
both
men
were
stripped
to
the
waist
and
panted
at
their
toil
the
little
chamber
or
cavern
in
which
they
worked
was
brilliantly
illuminated
by
their
two
candles
and
their
athletic
figures
stood
out
dark
and
picturesque
against
the
light
glistering
walls
a
curious
place
and
a
singular
man
observed
the
captain

fellow

captain

replied
the
sturdy
miner
resuming
his
work
good
specimens
of
men
these
said
the
captain
with
a
quiet
smile
to
oliver
of
course
i
do
mean
to
say
that
all
the
miners
hereabouts
are
possessed
of
such
large
families
nevertheless
there
are
as
i
dare
say
you
have
observed
a
good
many
children
in
and
about
st
just
proceeding
onward
they
diverged
into
a
branch
level
where
a
number
of
men
were
working
overhead
boring
holes
into
the
roof
and
burrowing
upwards
they
all
drove
onwards
through
flinty
rock
by
the
same
slow
and
toilsome
process
that
has
already
been
described
namely
by
chipping
with
the
pick
driving
holes
with
the
borer
and
blasting
with
gunpowder
as
the
captain
and
oliver
traversed
this
part
of
the
mine
they
had
occasionally
to
squeeze
past
small
iron
trucks
which
stood
below
holes
in
the
sides
of
the
level
down
which
ever
and
anon
masses
of
ore
and
debris
came
from
the
workings
above
with
a
hard
crashing
noise
the
ore
was
rich
with
tin
but
the
metal
was
invisible
to
any
but
trained
eyes
to
oliver
trembath
the
whole
stuff
appeared
like
wet
rubbish
suddenly
a
low
muffled
report
echoed
through
the
cavernous
place
it
was
followed
by
five
or
six
similar
reports
in
succession
they
are
blasting
said
captain
dan
as
he
spoke
the
thick
muddy
shoes
and
legs
of
a
man
appeared
coming
down
the
hole
that
had
previously
discharged
ore
the
man
himself
followed
his
legs
and
alighting
thereon
saluted
captain
dan
with
a
another
man
followed
him
from
a
different
part
of
the
surrounding
darkness
a
third
made
his
appearance
and
others
came
trooping
in
until
upwards
of
a
dozen
of
them
were
collected
in
the
narrow
tunnel
each
with
his
tallow
candle
in
his
hand
or
hat
so
that
the
place
was
lighted
brilliantly
they
were
all
clad
in
loose
patched
and
ragged
clothes
all
were
of
a
uniform
colour
each
with
his
broad
bosom
bared
and
perspiration
trickling
down
his
besmeared
countenance
here
however
the
uniformity
of
their
appearance
ended
for
they
were
of
all
sizes
and
characters
some
were
robust
and
muscular
some
were
lean
and
wiry
some
were
just
entering
on
manhood
with
the
ruddy
hue
of
health
shining
through
the
slime
on
their
smooth
faces
some
were
in
the
prime
of
life
pale
from
long
working
underground
but
strong
and
almost
as
hard
as
the
iron
with
which
they
chiselled
the
rocks
others
were
growing
old
and
an
occasional
cough
told
that
the
complaint
had
begun
its
fatal
undermining
of
the
human
body
there
were
one
or
two
whose
iron
constitutions
had
resisted
the
evil
influences
of
wet
garments
bad
air
and
chills
and
who
with
much
of
the
strength
of
manhood
and
some
of
the
colour
of
youth
were
still
plying
their
hammers
in
old
age
but
these
were
rare
specimens
of
vigour
and
longevity
not
many
such
are
to
be
found
in
botallack
mine
the
miner
working
life
is
a
short
one
and
comparatively
few
of
those
who
begin
it
live
to
a
healthy
old
age
little
boys
were
there
too
diminutive
but
sturdy
urchins
miniature
copies
of
their
seniors
though
somewhat
dirtier
proud
as
peacocks
because
of
being
permitted
at
so
early
an
age
to
accompany
their
fathers
or
brothers
underground
and
their
bosoms
swelling
with
that
stern
cornish
spirit
of
determination
to
face
and
overcome
great
difficulties
which
has
doubtless
much
to
do
with
the
excessive
development
of
chest
and
shoulder
for
which
cornish
miners
especially
those
of
just
are
celebrated
see
note
it
turned
out
that
the
men
had
all
arranged
to
fire
their
holes
at
the
same
hour
and
assemble
in
a
lower
level
to
take
lunch
or
as
they
term
it
kroust
while
the
smoke
should
clear
away
this
rendered
it
impossible
for
the
captain
to
take
his
young
companion
further
into
the
workings
at
that
part
of
the
mine
so
they
contented
themselves
with
a
chat
with
the
men
these
sat
down
in
a
row
and
each
man
unrolling
a
parcel
containing
a
pasty
or
a
thick
lump
of
cake
with
currants
in
it
commenced
the
demolition
thereof
with
as
much
zeal
as
had
previously
been
displayed
in
the
demolition
of
the
rock
this
frugal
fare
was
washed
down
with
water
drawn
from
little
flat
barrels
or
canteens
while
they
commented
lightly
grumblingly
or
laughingly
according
to
temperament
on
the
poor
condition
of
the
lode
at
which
they
wrought
we
have
already
said
that
in
mining
as
in
other
things
fortune
fluctuates
and
it
was
hard
times
with
the
men
of
botallack
at
that
period
before
they
had
proceeded
far
with
their
meal
one
of
the
men
began
to
cough
smoke
down
he
said
we
shall
to
move
then
observed
another
the
pouring
in
of
gunpowder
smoke
here
set
two
or
three
more
and
obliged
them
all
to
rise
and
seek
for
purer
perhaps
it
were
better
to
say
less
impure
air
in
another
part
of
the
level
where
the
draught
kept
the
smoke
away
here
squatting
down
on
heaps
of
wet
rubbish
and
sticking
their
candles
against
the
damp
walls
they
continued
their
meal
and
here
the
captain
and
oliver
left
them
retraced
their
steps
to
the
foot
of
the
shaft
and
began
the
ascent
to
the
surface
or
in
mining
parlance
began
to
return
to
grass
up
up
up
the
process
now
was
reversed
and
the
labour
increased
tenfold
up
they
went
on
these
nearly
perpendicular
and
interminable
ladders
slowly
for
they
had
a
long
journey
before
them
cautiously
for
oliver
had
a
tendency
to
butt
his
head
against
beams
and
knock
his
candle
out
of
shape
carefully
for
the
rounds
of
the
ladders
were
wet
and
slimy
and
a
slip
of
foot
or
hand
might
in
a
moment
have
precipitated
them
into
the
black
gulf
below
and
pantingly
for
strength
of
limb
and
lung
could
not
altogether
defy
the
influence
of
such
a
prolonged
and
upright
climb
if
oliver
trembath
felt
while
descending
as
though
he
should
reach
the
bottom
he
felt
far
more
powerfully
as
if
reaching
the
top
were
an
event
of
the
distant
future
all
the
more
that
the
muscles
of
his
arms
and
legs
unused
to
the
peculiar
process
were
beginning
to
feel
rather
stiff
this
feeling
however
soon
passed
away
and
when
he
began
to
grow
warm
to
the
work
his
strength
seemed
to
return
and
to
increase
with
each
step
a
species
of
revival
of
vigour
in
the
midst
of
hard
toil
with
which
probably
all
strong
men
are
acquainted
up
they
went
ladder
after
ladder
squeezing
through
narrow
places
rubbing
against
wet
rocks
and
beams
scraping
against
the
boarding
of
the
and
being
scraped
by
the
until
both
of
them
were
as
wet
and
red
and
dirty
as
any
miner
below
as
he
advanced
oliver
began
to
take
note
of
the
places
he
had
passed
on
the
way
down
and
so
much
had
he
seen
and
thought
during
his
sojourn
underground
that
when
he
reached
the
level
where
he
first
came
upon
the
noisy
kibbles
and
made
acquaintance
with
the
labouring
he
almost
hailed
the
spot
as
an
old
familiar
landmark
of
other
days
a
circumstance
occurred
just
then
which
surprised
him
not
a
little
and
tended
to
fix
this
locality
still
more
deeply
on
his
memory
while
he
was
standing
in
the
level
waiting
until
the
captain
should
relight
and
trim
his
much
and
oft
bruised
candle
the
kibbles
began
their
noisy
motion
this
was
nothing
new
now
but
at
the
same
time
the
shout
of
distant
voices
was
heard
as
if
the
gnomes
held
revelry
in
their
dreary
vaults
they
drew
gradually
nearer
and
oliver
could
distinguish
laughter
mingled
with
the
sound
of
rapidly
approaching
footsteps
foolish
lads
ejaculated
captain
dan
with
a
smile
and
an
expression
that
proved
he
took
some
interest
in
the
folly
whatever
it
might
be
what
is
it
inquired
oliver
they
are
racing
to
the
kibble
look
and
you
shall
see
replied
the
other
just
then
a
man
who
had
outrun
his
comrades
appeared
at
the
place
where
the
level
joined
the
shaft
just
opposite
almost
at
the
same
moment
the
kibble
appeared
flying
upwards
the
miner
leaped
upon
it
caught
and
clung
to
the
chain
as
it
passed
and
shouted
a
defiant
adieu
to
his
less
fortunate
comrades
who
arrived
just
in
time
to
witness
him
disappear
upwards
in
this
rapid
manner
to
grass
that
the
way
the
young
ones
risk
their
lives
said
the
captain
shaking
his
head
remonstratively
if
that
young
fellow
had
missed
the
kibble
he
would
have
been
dashed
to
pieces
at
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
again
captain
dan
said
foolish
lads
and
shook
his
head
so
gravely
that
oliver
could
not
help
regarding
him
with
the
respect
due
to
a
sedate
fatherly
sort
of
man
but
oliver
was
young
and
unsophisticated
and
did
not
know
at
the
time
that
the
captain
had
himself
been
noted
in
his
youth
as
an
extremely
reckless
and
daring
fellow
and
that
a
considerable
spice
of
the
daring
remained
in
him
still
diverging
to
the
right
at
this
point
captain
dan
led
oliver
to
an
old
part
of
the
mine
where
there
were
a
couple
of
men
opening
up
and
extending
one
of
the
old
levels
their
progress
here
was
very
different
from
what
it
had
been
evidently
the
former
miners
had
not
thought
it
worth
their
while
to
open
up
a
wide
passage
for
themselves
and
oliver
found
it
necessary
to
twist
his
broad
shoulders
into
all
sorts
of
positions
to
get
them
through
the
first
level
they
came
to
in
this
part
was
not
more
than
three
feet
high
at
the
entrance
a
man
ca
hold
his
head
very
high
here
sir
said
his
guide
truly
no
it
is
scarce
high
enough
for
my
legs
to
walk
in
without
any
body
above
them
said
oliver
however
lead
the
way
and
i
will
follow
the
captain
stooped
and
made
his
way
through
a
winding
passage
where
the
roof
was
so
low
in
many
places
that
they
were
obliged
to
bend
quite
double
and
the
back
and
neck
of
the
young
doctor
began
to
feel
the
strain
very
severely
there
were
however
a
few
spots
where
the
roof
rose
a
little
affording
temporary
relief
presently
they
came
to
the
place
where
the
men
were
at
work
the
ground
was
very
soft
here
the
men
were
cutting
through
granite
a
condition
of
the
stone
which
oliver
confessed
he
had
never
expected
to
see
here
the
lights
burned
very
badly
what
can
be
the
matter
with
it
said
oliver
stopping
for
the
third
time
to
trim
the
wick
of
his
candle
captain
dan
smiled
as
he
said
you
asked
me
last
night
to
take
you
into
one
of
the
levels
where
the
air
was
bad
now
here
you
are
with
the
air
so
bad
that
the
candle
will
hardly
burn
it
will
be
worse
before
night
but
i
feel
no
disagreeable
sensation
said
oliver
possibly
not
because
you
are
not
quite
so
sensitive
as
the
flame
of
a
candle
but
if
you
remain
here
a
few
hours
it
will
tell
upon
you
here
are
the
men
you
can
ask
them
the
two
men
were
resting
when
they
approached
one
was
old
the
other
both
were
hearty
fellows
and
communicative
the
old
one
especially
was
ruddy
in
complexion
and
pretty
strong
you
look
well
for
an
old
miner
said
oliver
what
may
be
your
age
about
sixty
sur
indeed
you
are
a
notable
exception
to
the
rule
how
comes
it
that
you
look
so
fresh
ca
say
sur
replied
the
old
man
with
a
peculiar
smile
few
miners
live
to
my
time
of
life
much
less
do
they
go
underground
because
i
neither
drink
nor
smoke
tom
there
now
he
added
pointing
to
his
comrade
with
his
thumb
he
ai
forty
yit
but
he
so
pale
as
a
ghost
though
he
is
strong
and
do
you
neither
drink
nor
smoke
tom
inquired
oliver
well
sur
i
both
smokes
and
drinks
but
i
do
take
in
moderation
said
tom
are
you
married
asked
oliver
turning
again
to
the
old
man
iss
got
a
wife
at
hum
an
had
six
do
you
find
this
bad
air
tell
on
your
health
he
continued
iss
sur
after
six
or
seven
hours
i
do
feel
my
head
like
to
split
an
my
stummik
as
if
it
wor
on
fire
but
what
can
us
do
we
must
live
you
knaw
bidding
these
men
goodbye
the
captain
and
oliver
went
down
to
another
level
and
then
along
a
series
of
low
galleries
in
some
of
which
they
had
to
advance
on
their
hands
and
knees
and
in
one
of
them
particularly
the
accumulation
of
rubbish
was
so
great
and
the
roof
so
low
that
they
could
only
force
a
passage
through
by
wriggling
along
at
full
length
like
snakes
beyond
this
they
found
a
miner
and
a
little
boy
at
work
and
here
captain
dan
pointed
out
to
his
companion
that
the
lodes
of
copper
and
tin
were
rich
glittering
particles
on
the
walls
and
drops
of
water
hanging
from
points
and
crevices
with
the
green
purple
and
yellow
colours
around
combined
to
give
the
place
a
brilliant
metallic
aspect
you
better
break
off
a
piece
of
ore
here
said
captain
dan
oliver
took
a
chisel
and
hammer
from
the
miner
and
applying
them
to
the
rock
spent
five
minutes
in
belabouring
it
with
scarcely
any
result
if
it
were
not
that
i
fear
to
miss
the
chisel
and
hit
my
knuckles
he
said
i
think
i
could
work
more
effectively
as
he
spoke
he
struck
with
all
his
force
and
brought
down
a
large
piece
a
chip
of
which
he
carried
away
as
a
memorial
of
his
underground
ramble
the
man
is
going
to
fire
the
hole
said
captain
dan
you
better
wait
and
see
it
the
hole
was
sunk
nearly
two
feet
deep
diagonally
behind
a
large
mass
of
rock
that
projected
from
the
side
of
the
level
it
was
charged
with
gunpowder
and
filled
up
with
tamping
or
pounded
granite
then
the
miner
lighted
the
fuse
and
hastened
away
giving
the
usual
signal
fire
the
others
followed
him
to
a
safe
distance
and
awaited
the
result
in
a
few
minutes
there
was
a
loud
report
a
bright
blinding
flash
and
a
concussion
of
the
air
which
extinguished
two
of
the
candles
immediately
a
crash
followed
as
the
heavy
mass
of
rock
was
torn
from
its
bed
and
hurled
to
the
ground
that
the
way
we
raise
tin
and
copper
said
captain
dan
now
doctor
we
had
better
return
if
you
would
not
be
left
in
darkness
for
our
candles
are
getting
low
did
you
ever
travel
underground
in
the
dark
inquired
oliver
not
often
but
i
have
done
it
occasionally
once
in
particular
i
went
down
the
main
shaft
in
the
dark
and
gave
a
miner
an
awful
fright
i
had
to
go
down
in
haste
at
the
time
and
not
having
a
candle
at
hand
besides
being
well
acquainted
with
the
way
i
hurried
down
in
the
dark
it
so
chanced
that
a
man
named
sampy
had
got
his
light
put
out
when
about
to
ascend
the
shaft
and
as
he
also
was
well
acquainted
with
the
way
he
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
relight
there
was
a
good
deal
of
noise
in
consequence
of
the
pump
being
at
work
when
i
had
got
about
down
i
put
my
foot
on
something
that
felt
soft
instantly
there
was
uttered
a
tremendous
yell
and
my
legs
at
the
same
moment
were
seized
by
something
from
below
my
heart
almost
jumped
out
of
my
mouth
at
this
but
as
the
yell
was
repeated
it
flashed
across
me
i
must
have
trod
on
some
one
fingers
so
i
lifted
my
foot
at
once
and
then
a
voice
which
i
knew
to
be
that
of
sampy
began
to
wail
and
lament
miserably
i
have
hurt
sampy
said
i
dear
aw
dear
aw
my
dear
was
all
that
poor
sampy
could
reply
us
go
up
my
son
said
i
we
strike
a
light
so
up
we
went
to
the
next
level
where
i
got
hold
of
the
poor
candle
and
lighted
it
my
dear
said
sampy
looking
at
his
fingers
with
a
rueful
countenance
have
scat
all
in
jowds
pray
interrupted
oliver
what
may
be
the
meaning
of
all
in
jowds
broke
all
in
pieces
replied
captain
dan
but
he
was
wrong
for
no
bones
were
broken
and
the
fingers
were
all
right
again
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
sampy
got
a
tremendous
fright
however
and
he
was
never
known
to
travel
underground
without
a
light
after
that
continuing
to
retrace
their
steps
captain
dan
and
oliver
made
for
the
main
shaft
on
the
way
they
came
to
another
of
those
immense
empty
spaces
where
a
large
lode
had
been
worked
away
and
nothing
left
in
the
dark
narrow
void
but
the
short
beams
which
had
supported
the
working
stages
of
the
men
here
oliver
looking
down
through
a
hole
at
his
feet
saw
several
men
far
below
him
they
were
at
work
on
the
end
in
three
successive
tiers
above
each
other
heads
you
seen
two
of
these
men
before
said
captain
dan
have
i
yes
they
are
local
preachers
the
last
time
you
saw
the
upper
one
said
captain
dan
with
a
smile
you
were
seated
in
the
wesleyan
chapel
and
he
was
in
the
pulpit
dressed
like
a
gentleman
and
preaching
as
eloquently
as
if
he
had
been
educated
at
college
and
trained
for
the
ministry
i
should
like
very
much
to
go
down
and
visit
them
said
oliver
is
a
difficult
descent
there
are
no
ladders
will
your
head
stand
stepping
from
beam
to
beam
and
can
you
lower
yourself
by
a
chain
i
try
said
oliver
without
more
words
captain
dan
left
the
platform
on
which
they
had
been
walking
and
descending
through
a
hole
led
his
companion
by
the
most
rugged
way
he
had
yet
attempted
sometimes
they
slid
on
their
heels
down
places
that
oliver
would
not
have
dreamed
of
attempting
without
a
guide
at
other
times
they
stepped
from
beam
to
beam
with
unknown
depths
below
them
have
a
care
here
sir
said
the
captain
pausing
before
a
very
steep
place
i
will
go
first
and
wait
for
you
so
saying
he
seized
a
piece
of
old
rusty
chain
that
was
fastened
into
the
rock
and
swung
himself
down
then
looking
up
he
called
to
oliver
to
follow
the
young
doctor
did
so
and
having
cautiously
lowered
himself
a
few
yards
he
reached
a
beam
where
he
found
the
captain
holding
up
his
candle
and
regarding
him
with
some
anxiety
captain
dan
appeared
as
if
suspended
in
opposite
to
him
in
the
distance
the
two
local
preachers
were
hard
at
work
with
hammer
and
chisel
while
far
below
a
miner
could
be
seen
coming
along
the
next
level
and
pushing
an
iron
truck
full
of
ore
before
him
a
few
more
steps
and
slides
and
then
a
short
ascent
and
oliver
stood
beside
the
man
who
had
preached
the
previous
sunday
he
worked
with
another
miner
and
was
red
ragged
and
like
all
the
rest
and
the
perspiration
was
pouring
over
his
face
which
was
streaked
with
slime
very
unlike
was
he
at
that
time
to
the
gentlemanly
youth
who
had
held
forth
from
the
pulpit
oliver
had
a
long
chat
with
him
and
found
that
he
aspired
to
enter
the
ministry
and
had
already
passed
some
severe
examinations
he
was
having
procured
the
loan
of
books
from
his
minister
and
some
friends
who
were
interested
in
him
his
language
and
manners
were
those
of
a
gentleman
yet
he
had
had
no
advantages
beyond
his
fellows
my
friend
there
sir
also
hopes
to
enter
the
ministry
said
the
miner
pointing
as
he
spoke
to
a
gap
between
the
boards
on
which
he
stood
oliver
looked
down
and
there
beheld
a
stalwart
young
man
about
a
couple
of
yards
under
his
feet
wielding
a
hammer
with
tremendous
vigour
his
light
linen
coat
was
open
displaying
his
bared
and
muscular
bosom
what
is
a
local
preacher
also
he
is
sir
said
the
miner
with
a
smile
oliver
immediately
descended
to
the
stage
below
and
had
a
chat
with
this
man
also
after
which
he
left
them
at
their
work
wondering
very
much
at
the
intelligence
and
learning
displayed
by
them
for
he
remembered
that
in
their
sermons
they
had
without
notes
without
hesitation
and
without
a
grammatical
error
entered
into
the
most
subtle
metaphysical
reasoning
rather
too
much
of
it
indeed
and
had
preached
with
impassioned
perhaps
too
impassioned
eloquence
quoting
poets
and
prose
writers
ancient
and
modern
with
the
facility
of
good
scholars
while
they
urged
men
and
women
to
repent
and
flee
to
christ
with
all
the
fervour
of
men
thoroughly
in
earnest
on
the
other
hand
he
knew
that
their
opportunities
for
were
not
great
and
that
they
had
to
toil
in
the
meantime
for
daily
bread
at
the
rate
of
about
pounds
a
month
following
captain
dan
oliver
soon
reached
the
while
slowly
and
in
silence
ascending
the
ladders
they
heard
a
sound
of
music
above
them
men
coming
down
to
work
singing
said
the
captain
as
they
stood
on
a
to
listen
the
sounds
at
first
were
very
faint
and
inexpressibly
sweet
by
degrees
they
became
more
distinct
and
oliver
could
distinguish
several
voices
singing
in
harmony
keeping
time
to
the
slow
measured
tread
of
their
descending
steps
there
seemed
a
novelty
and
yet
a
strange
familiarity
in
the
strains
as
they
were
wafted
softly
down
upon
his
ear
until
they
drew
near
and
the
candles
of
the
miners
became
visible
their
manly
voices
then
poured
forth
in
full
strength
the
glorious
called
french
which
is
usually
sung
in
scotland
to
the
beautiful
psalm
beginning
i
to
the
hills
will
lift
mine
eyes
the
men
stopped
abruptly
on
encountering
their
captain
and
the
stranger
exchanging
a
few
words
with
the
former
they
stood
aside
on
the
beams
to
let
them
pass
a
little
boy
came
last
his
small
limbs
were
as
active
as
those
of
his
more
stalwart
comrades
and
he
exhibited
no
signs
of
fatigue
his
treble
voice
too
was
heard
high
and
tuneful
among
the
others
as
they
continued
their
descent
and
resumed
the
psalm
the
sweet
strains
retired
gradually
and
faded
in
the
depths
below
as
they
had
first
stolen
on
the
senses
from
above
and
the
pleasant
memory
of
them
still
remained
with
the
young
doctor
when
he
emerged
from
the
mine
through
the
hole
at
the
head
of
the
shaft
and
stood
once
more
in
the
blessed
sunshine
note
reader
allow
us
to
remark
that
this
is
a
fact
indeed
we
may
say
here
once
for
all
that
all
the
statements
and
incidents
in
this
tale
are
facts
or
founded
on
facts
with
considerable
modification
but
without
intentional
exaggeration
note
it
has
been
stated
to
us
recently
by
a
volunteer
officer
that
at
battalion
parade
when
companies
were
equalised
in
numbers
the
companies
formed
by
the
men
of
just
required
about
four
paces
more
space
to
stand
upon
than
the
other
volunteers
no
one
who
visits
a
just
miner
at
his
underground
toil
will
require
to
ask
the
reason
why
chapter
nine
treats
of
difficulties
to
be
overcome
one
afternoon
a
council
we
may
appropriately
say
of
war
was
held
in
just
the
scene
of
the
council
was
the
shop
of
maggot
the
blacksmith
and
the
members
of
it
were
a
number
of
miners
the
president
being
the
worthy
smith
himself
who
with
a
under
his
arm
in
the
position
of
a
short
crutch
occupied
the
chair
if
we
may
be
allowed
so
to
designate
the
raised
hearth
of
the
forge
the
war
with
poverty
had
not
been
very
successfully
waged
of
late
and
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
the
enemy
had
apparently
given
the
miners
a
severe
check
in
the
way
of
putting
what
appeared
to
be
an
insuperable
obstacle
in
their
path
now
lads
said
maggot
with
a
slap
on
the
leathern
apron
that
covered
his
knees
this
is
the
way
on
it
an
do
be
quiet
and
hould
yer
tongues
while
i
do
spaik
the
other
men
of
whom
there
were
nearly
a
dozen
nodded
and
said
go
on
booy
thee
knaw
tin
sure
by
which
expression
they
affirmed
their
belief
that
the
blacksmith
was
a
very
knowing
fellow
you
do
tell
me
that
you
come
so
close
to
water
that
you
to
go
on
is
that
so
iss
iss
responded
the
others
well
i
hole
into
the
house
ef
you
do
agree
to
give
un
a
good
pitch
said
maggot
agreed
one
and
all
cried
the
miners
in
order
that
the
reader
may
understand
the
drift
of
this
conversation
it
is
necessary
to
explain
that
the
indefatigable
miner
david
trevarrow
whom
we
have
already
introduced
in
his
submarine
workshop
had
according
to
his
plan
changed
his
ground
and
transferred
his
labour
to
a
more
hopeful
part
of
the
mine
for
some
time
previous
the
men
had
been
at
work
on
a
lode
which
was
very
promising
but
they
were
compelled
to
cease
following
it
because
it
approached
the
workings
of
an
old
part
of
the
mine
which
was
known
to
be
full
of
water
to
tap
this
old
part
or
as
the
miners
expressed
it
to
hole
into
this
house
of
water
was
they
were
well
aware
an
exceedingly
dangerous
operation
the
part
of
the
mine
to
which
we
allude
was
not
under
the
sea
but
back
a
little
from
the
shore
and
was
not
very
deep
at
that
time
the
adit
or
level
by
which
the
spot
was
reached
commenced
at
the
cliffs
on
a
level
with
the
seashore
and
ran
into
the
interior
until
it
reached
the
old
mine
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
inland
here
was
situated
the
house
which
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
number
of
old
shafts
and
levels
filled
with
water
as
they
had
approached
the
old
mine
its
near
proximity
was
made
disagreeably
evident
by
the
quantity
of
moisture
that
oozed
through
the
crevices
in
the
rocks
moisture
which
ere
long
took
the
form
of
a
number
of
tiny
rills
and
at
last
began
to
spirt
out
from
roof
and
sides
in
such
a
way
that
the
miners
became
alarmed
and
hesitated
to
continue
to
work
in
a
place
where
they
ran
the
most
imminent
risk
of
being
suddenly
drowned
and
swept
into
the
sea
by
the
bursting
of
the
rocks
that
still
withstood
the
immense
pressure
of
the
confined
water
it
was
at
this
point
in
the
undertaking
that
david
trevarrow
went
to
examine
the
place
and
made
the
discovery
of
a
seam
a
keenly
lode
which
had
such
a
promising
appearance
that
the
anxiety
of
the
miners
to
get
rid
of
this
obstructive
house
was
redoubled
it
was
at
this
point
too
that
the
council
of
which
we
write
was
held
in
order
to
settle
who
should
have
the
undesirable
privilege
of
constituting
the
forlorn
hope
in
their
subterranean
assault
maggot
who
was
known
to
be
one
of
the
boldest
and
at
the
same
time
one
of
the
most
utterly
reckless
men
in
just
was
appealed
to
in
the
emergency
and
as
we
have
seen
offered
to
attack
the
enemy
on
condition
that
the
miners
should
give
him
a
pitch
of
the
good
lode
they
had
found
that
is
give
him
the
right
to
work
out
a
certain
number
of
fathoms
of
ore
for
himself
they
agreed
to
this
but
one
of
them
expressed
some
doubt
as
to
courage
being
equal
to
the
occasion
to
this
remark
maggot
vouchsafed
no
other
reply
than
a
frown
but
his
friend
and
admirer
john
cock
exclaimed
in
supreme
contempt
what
maggot
afear
to
do
it
aw
my
dear
hould
tha
tongue
but
he
have
bin
to
see
the
place
urged
the
previous
speaker
no
my
son
said
maggot
turning
on
the
man
with
a
look
of
pity
but
he
can
go
an
see
it
come
lads
lev
us
go
an
see
this
place
of
danger
the
miners
rose
at
once
as
maggot
threw
his
forehammer
on
a
heap
of
coals
put
on
his
hat
and
strode
out
of
the
forge
with
a
reckless
fling
a
few
minutes
sufficed
to
bring
them
to
the
beach
at
the
mouth
of
the
adit
it
was
a
singularly
wild
spot
close
under
those
precipitous
cliffs
on
which
some
of
the
picturesque
buildings
of
botallack
mine
are
perched
a
sort
of
narrow
inlet
or
gorge
which
from
its
form
is
named
the
narrow
zawn
there
was
nothing
worthy
of
the
name
of
a
beach
at
the
place
save
a
little
piece
of
rugged
ground
near
the
adit
mouth
which
could
be
reached
only
by
a
zigzag
path
on
the
face
of
the
almost
perpendicular
precipice
arrived
here
each
man
lighted
a
candle
wrapped
the
customary
piece
of
wet
clay
round
the
middle
of
it
and
entered
the
narrow
tunnel
they
advanced
in
single
file
james
penrose
leading
the
height
of
the
adit
permitted
of
their
walking
almost
upright
but
the
irregularity
of
the
cuttings
rendered
it
necessary
that
they
should
advance
carefully
with
special
regard
to
their
heads
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
reached
a
comparatively
open
space
that
is
to
say
there
were
several
extensions
of
the
cutting
in
various
directions
which
gave
the
place
the
appearance
of
being
a
small
cavern
instead
of
a
narrow
tunnel
here
the
water
which
in
other
parts
of
the
adit
flowed
along
the
bottom
ran
down
the
walls
and
spirted
in
fine
streams
from
the
almost
invisible
crevices
of
the
rock
thus
betraying
at
once
the
proximity
and
the
power
of
the
water
what
now
my
son
asked
an
elderly
man
who
stood
at
elbow
after
a
short
pause
during
which
he
sternly
regarded
the
rocks
before
him
the
smith
replied
do
in
the
tone
and
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
knows
that
what
he
has
made
up
his
mind
to
do
is
not
play
the
question
being
thus
settled
the
miners
retraced
their
steps
and
went
to
their
several
homes
entering
his
cottage
the
smith
found
his
little
girl
grace
busily
engaged
in
the
interesting
process
of
nursing
the
baby
he
seated
himself
in
a
chair
by
the
fireside
smoked
his
pipe
and
watched
the
process
while
his
wife
busied
herself
in
preparing
the
evening
meal
oh
but
the
little
maggot
was
a
big
baby
a
worthy
representative
of
his
father
a
true
chip
of
the
old
block
for
he
was
not
only
fat
riotous
and
muscular
but
very
reckless
and
extremely
positive
his
little
nurse
on
the
contrary
was
gentle
and
delicate
not
much
bigger
than
the
baby
although
a
good
deal
older
and
she
had
a
dreadful
business
of
it
to
keep
him
in
order
all
her
efforts
at
lifting
and
restraining
him
were
somewhat
akin
to
the
exertion
made
by
wrestlers
to
throw
each
other
by
main
force
and
her
intense
desire
to
make
baby
maggot
be
good
was
repaid
by
severe
kicks
on
the
shins
and
sundry
dabs
in
the
face
with
luckily
a
soft
fat
pair
of
fists
sit
quiet
now
or
i
scat
oo
nose
said
the
little
nurse
suddenly
with
a
terrible
frown
it
need
scarcely
be
said
that
she
had
not
the
remotest
intention
of
carrying
out
this
dreadful
threat
to
smash
the
little
maggot
nose
she
accompanied
it
however
with
a
twist
that
suddenly
placed
the
urchin
in
a
sitting
posture
much
to
his
own
surprise
for
he
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
drew
his
breath
sharply
and
appeared
to
meditate
a
roar
he
thought
better
of
it
however
and
relapsed
into
goodness
just
as
the
door
opened
and
david
trevarrow
entered
oh
uncle
david
cried
little
grace
jumping
up
and
running
towards
him
do
help
me
nuss
baby
what
the
matter
with
the
cheeld
bad
eh
fetch
un
to
me
and
cure
him
there
was
no
necessity
to
fetch
baby
for
that
obstreperous
individual
entertained
an
immense
regard
for
unkil
day
and
was
already
on
his
fat
legs
staggering
across
the
floor
to
him
with
outstretched
arms
thereafter
he
only
required
a
pair
of
wings
to
make
him
a
complete
cherub
little
grace
relieved
of
her
charge
at
once
set
to
work
to
assist
her
mother
in
household
matters
she
was
one
of
those
dear
little
earnest
creatures
who
of
their
own
accord
act
in
a
motherly
and
wifely
way
from
their
early
years
to
look
at
little
grace
serious
thoroughgoing
face
when
she
chanced
to
pause
in
the
midst
of
work
and
meditate
what
was
to
be
done
next
one
might
imagine
that
the
entire
care
of
the
household
had
suddenly
devolved
upon
her
shoulders
in
the
matter
of
housewifery
little
grace
was
almost
equal
to
big
grace
her
respected
mother
in
downright
honesty
and
truthfulness
she
greatly
excelled
her
the
description
of
maggot
household
on
that
evening
would
be
very
incomplete
were
we
to
omit
mention
of
zackey
maggot
that
young
man
for
man
he
deemed
himself
and
man
he
was
in
all
respects
except
the
trifling
matters
of
years
size
and
whiskers
that
young
man
entered
the
room
with
his
uncle
and
without
deigning
to
change
his
wet
red
garments
sat
him
down
at
his
father
feet
and
caught
hold
of
a
small
black
kitten
which
at
the
time
lay
sound
asleep
on
the
hearth
and
began
to
play
with
it
in
a
grave
patronising
way
as
though
his
taking
notice
of
it
at
all
were
a
condescension
that
black
kitten
or
chet
as
it
was
usually
styled
was
accustomed
to
be
strangled
the
greater
part
of
the
morning
by
the
baby
most
of
the
afternoon
it
was
worried
by
zackey
and
during
the
intervals
of
torment
it
experienced
an
unusually
large
measure
of
the
vicissitudes
incident
to
kitten
life
such
as
being
kicked
out
of
the
way
by
maggot
senior
or
thrown
or
terrified
out
of
the
way
by
mrs
maggot
or
dashed
at
by
stray
dogs
or
yelled
at
by
passing
boys
the
only
sunshine
of
its
life
which
was
at
all
times
liable
to
be
suddenly
clouded
was
when
it
slept
or
when
little
grace
put
it
on
her
soft
neck
tickled
its
chin
and
otherwise
soothed
its
ruffled
spirit
as
only
a
loving
heart
knows
how
a
bad
memory
seemed
to
be
that
kitten
chief
blessing
a
horror
of
any
kind
was
no
sooner
past
than
it
was
straightway
forgotten
and
the
facetious
animal
would
advance
with
arched
back
and
glaring
eyes
in
defiance
of
an
incursive
hen
or
twirl
in
mad
hopeless
career
after
its
own
miserable
tail
is
a
keenly
lode
said
maggot
puffing
his
pipe
thoughtfully
iss
assented
david
trevarrow
also
puffing
his
pipe
at
the
clouds
issuing
from
which
baby
gazed
with
endless
amazement
and
admiration
it
worth
much
but
it
is
worth
your
life
sure
i
ai
goin
to
give
my
life
replied
maggot
but
you
goin
to
risk
it
said
david
an
you
should
for
you
a
wife
an
to
provide
for
now
i
tell
what
it
is
you
lev
it
to
me
hole
to
the
house
it
do
matter
much
what
happens
to
me
no
wo
said
maggot
stoutly
what
i
do
promise
to
do
i
do
but
if
you
die
said
david
well
what
if
i
do
we
have
all
to
come
to
that
some
day
sooner
or
later
are
you
prepared
to
die
asked
trevarrow
earnestly
now
david
do
trouble
me
with
that
is
all
very
well
for
the
women
an
but
it
do
suit
me
it
do
so
lev
us
have
no
more
of
it
booy
i
do
it
that
fixed
so
now
we
have
a
bit
supper
the
tone
in
which
maggot
said
this
assured
david
that
further
conversation
would
be
useless
so
he
dropped
the
subject
and
sat
down
with
the
rest
of
the
family
to
their
evening
meal
chapter
ten
shows
how
maggot
made
a
desperate
venture
and
what
flowed
from
it
a
wilful
man
must
have
his
way
is
a
proverb
the
truth
of
which
was
illustrated
by
the
blacksmith
on
the
following
day
david
trevarrow
again
attempted
to
dissuade
him
from
his
purpose
and
reiterated
his
offer
to
go
in
his
stead
but
he
failed
to
move
him
mrs
maggot
essayed
and
added
tears
to
her
suasion
as
also
did
little
grace
but
they
failed
too
the
obdurate
man
would
not
give
way
the
only
one
of
his
household
who
did
not
attempt
to
dissuade
him
excepting
of
course
the
baby
who
cared
nothing
whatever
about
the
matter
was
zackey
that
urchin
not
only
rejoiced
in
the
failure
of
the
others
to
turn
his
father
from
his
purpose
but
pleaded
hard
to
be
allowed
to
go
with
him
and
share
his
danger
as
well
as
glory
this
however
was
peremptorily
denied
to
the
young
aspirant
to
fame
and
a
premature
death
by
drowning
in
a
dark
hole
early
in
the
forenoon
maggot
and
his
friends
proceeded
to
the
shore
where
they
found
a
number
of
miners
and
others
assembled
near
the
adit
mouth
among
them
our
hero
oliver
trembath
mr
donnithorne
and
mr
cornish
at
that
time
the
purser
and
manager
of
botallack
mine
the
latter
gentleman
accosted
maggot
as
he
came
forward
and
advised
him
to
be
cautious
of
course
the
smith
gave
every
assurance
that
was
required
of
him
and
immediately
prepared
himself
to
make
the
dangerous
experiment
supplying
himself
with
a
number
of
tallow
candles
a
mining
hammer
and
other
tools
maggot
stripped
to
the
waist
and
jestingly
bidding
his
friends
farewell
entered
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
and
disappeared
the
adit
level
or
tunnel
through
which
he
had
to
pass
to
the
scene
of
his
operations
was
as
we
have
said
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
length
about
six
feet
high
and
two
and
a
half
feet
wide
it
varied
in
dimensions
here
and
there
however
and
was
rough
and
irregular
throughout
for
the
first
hundred
yards
or
so
maggot
could
see
well
enough
to
grope
his
way
by
the
daylight
which
streamed
in
at
the
entrance
of
the
adit
but
beyond
this
point
all
was
intense
darkness
so
here
he
stopped
and
striking
a
light
by
means
of
flint
steel
and
tinder
lit
one
of
his
candles
this
he
attached
to
a
piece
of
wet
clay
in
the
usual
fashion
except
that
he
placed
the
clay
at
the
lower
end
of
the
candle
instead
of
round
the
middle
of
it
he
then
stuck
it
against
the
rock
a
little
above
the
level
of
his
head
lighting
another
candle
he
advanced
with
it
in
his
hand
walking
or
rather
wading
onward
for
the
stream
was
far
enough
to
be
almost
beyond
the
influence
of
the
first
candle
he
stopped
again
and
stuck
up
another
thus
at
intervals
he
placed
candles
along
the
entire
length
of
the
adit
so
that
he
might
have
light
to
guide
him
in
his
race
from
the
water
which
he
hoped
to
set
free
this
precaution
was
necessary
because
although
he
meant
to
carry
a
candle
in
his
hat
all
the
time
there
was
a
possibility
nay
a
strong
probability
that
it
would
be
blown
or
drowned
out
little
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
brought
him
to
the
scene
of
his
intended
adventure
here
he
found
the
water
spirting
out
all
round
much
more
violently
than
it
had
been
the
day
before
he
did
not
waste
much
time
in
consideration
having
made
up
his
mind
on
the
previous
visit
as
to
which
part
of
the
rock
he
would
drive
the
hole
through
sticking
his
last
candle
therefore
against
the
driest
part
of
the
wall
that
could
be
found
he
seized
his
tools
and
commenced
work
we
have
already
said
that
maggot
was
a
strong
man
as
he
stood
there
naked
to
the
waist
holding
the
borer
with
his
left
hand
and
plying
the
hammer
with
all
his
might
with
the
other
his
great
breadth
of
shoulder
and
development
of
muscle
were
finely
displayed
by
the
candlelight
which
fell
in
brilliant
gleams
on
parts
of
his
frame
while
the
rest
of
him
was
thrown
into
shadow
so
deep
that
it
would
have
appeared
black
but
for
the
deeper
shade
by
which
it
was
surrounded
the
whole
scene
presenting
a
grand
rembrandt
effect
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
maggot
wrought
with
might
and
main
excited
somewhat
by
the
novelty
and
danger
of
his
undertaking
he
felt
relieved
by
the
violence
of
his
exertion
he
knew
besides
that
the
candles
which
were
to
light
him
on
his
return
were
slowly
but
surely
burning
down
blow
after
blow
resounded
through
the
place
incessantly
when
the
smith
right
arm
felt
a
very
little
wearied
it
was
too
powerful
to
be
soon
or
greatly
exhausted
he
shifted
the
hammer
to
his
left
hand
and
so
the
work
went
on
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
the
borer
was
driven
to
its
head
into
the
hole
by
a
tremendous
blow
the
rock
behind
it
had
given
way
almost
at
the
same
instant
a
large
mass
of
rock
burst
outwards
followed
by
a
stream
of
water
so
thick
and
violent
that
it
went
straight
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
cavern
against
which
it
burst
in
white
foam
this
rebounding
back
and
around
rushed
against
roof
and
sides
with
such
force
that
the
whole
place
was
at
once
deluged
maggot
was
knocked
down
at
the
first
gush
but
leaped
up
and
turned
to
fly
of
course
both
candles
that
in
his
hat
as
well
as
that
which
he
had
affixed
to
the
wall
were
extinguished
and
he
was
at
once
plunged
in
total
darkness
for
the
rays
of
the
next
light
although
visible
were
too
feeble
to
penetrate
with
any
effect
to
the
extremity
of
the
adit
blinded
by
rushing
water
and
confused
by
his
fall
the
smith
mistook
his
direction
and
ran
against
the
side
of
the
level
with
such
violence
that
he
fell
again
but
his
sturdy
frame
withstood
the
shock
and
once
more
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
leaped
along
the
narrow
tunnel
with
all
the
energy
of
desperation
well
was
it
for
maggot
at
that
hour
that
his
heart
was
bold
and
his
faculties
cool
and
collected
else
then
and
there
his
career
had
ended
bending
forward
and
stooping
low
he
bounded
away
like
a
hunted
deer
but
the
rush
of
water
was
so
great
that
it
rapidly
gained
on
him
and
by
concealing
the
uneven
places
in
the
path
caused
him
to
stumble
his
relay
of
candles
served
him
in
good
stead
nevertheless
despite
their
light
and
his
own
caution
he
more
than
once
narrowly
missed
dashing
out
his
brains
on
the
low
roof
on
came
the
water
after
the
fugitive
a
mighty
hissing
vaulting
torrent
filling
the
level
behind
and
leaping
up
on
the
man
higher
and
higher
as
he
struggled
and
floundered
on
for
life
quickly
and
before
quarter
of
the
distance
to
the
adit
mouth
was
traversed
it
gurgled
up
to
his
waist
swept
him
off
his
legs
and
hurled
him
against
projecting
rocks
once
and
again
did
he
succeed
in
regaining
his
foothold
but
in
a
moment
or
two
the
rising
flood
swept
him
down
and
hurled
him
violently
onward
sporting
with
him
on
its
foaming
crest
until
it
disgorged
him
at
last
and
cast
him
stunned
bruised
and
bleeding
on
the
seashore
of
course
the
unfortunate
man
friends
had
waited
for
him
with
some
impatience
and
great
was
their
anxiety
when
the
first
of
the
flood
made
its
appearance
when
immediately
after
the
battered
form
of
their
comrade
was
flung
on
the
beach
they
ran
forward
and
bore
him
out
of
the
stream
oliver
trembath
being
on
the
spot
maggot
wae
at
once
attended
to
and
his
wounds
bound
up
he
do
he
all
right
said
oliver
on
completing
the
work
only
got
a
few
cuts
and
bruises
and
lost
a
little
blood
but
that
wo
harm
him
the
expression
of
anxiety
that
had
appeared
on
the
faces
of
those
who
stood
around
at
once
vanished
on
hearing
these
reassuring
words
i
knaw
it
said
john
cock
energetically
i
knaw
he
could
be
killed
not
he
i
trust
that
you
may
be
right
oliver
said
old
mr
donnithorne
looking
with
much
concern
on
the
pale
countenance
of
the
poor
smith
who
still
lay
stretched
out
with
only
a
slight
motion
of
the
chest
to
prove
that
the
vital
spark
had
not
been
altogether
extinguished
no
fear
of
him
he
sure
to
come
round
replied
oliver
come
lads
up
with
him
on
your
backs
he
raised
the
smith
shoulder
as
he
spoke
three
tall
and
powerful
miners
promptly
lent
their
aid
and
maggot
was
raised
and
conveyed
up
the
steep
winding
path
that
led
to
the
top
of
the
cliff
it
would
never
do
to
lose
maggot
murmured
mr
donnithorne
as
if
speaking
to
himself
while
he
followed
the
procession
beside
mr
cornish
he
far
too
good
a
a
smuggler
eh
interrupted
the
purser
with
a
laugh
eh
ah
did
i
say
smuggler
cried
mr
donnithorne
surely
not
for
of
all
vices
that
of
smuggling
is
one
of
the
worst
unless
it
be
an
overfondness
for
the
bottle
i
meant
to
have
said
that
he
is
too
valuable
a
man
for
just
to
lose
in
many
ways
and
you
know
mr
cornish
that
he
is
a
famous
wrestler
a
man
of
whom
just
may
be
justly
proud
mr
donnithorne
cast
a
sly
glance
at
his
companion
whom
he
knew
to
be
partial
to
the
ancient
cornish
pastime
of
wrestling
indeed
if
report
said
truly
the
worthy
purser
had
himself
in
his
youthful
days
been
a
celebrated
amateur
wrestler
one
who
had
never
been
thrown
even
although
he
had
on
more
than
one
occasion
been
induced
in
a
frolic
to
enter
the
public
ring
and
measure
his
strength
with
the
best
men
that
could
be
brought
against
him
he
was
long
past
the
time
of
life
when
men
indulge
in
such
rough
play
but
his
tall
commanding
figure
and
huge
chest
and
shoulders
were
quite
sufficient
to
warrant
the
belief
that
what
was
said
of
him
was
possible
while
the
expression
of
his
fine
massive
countenance
and
the
humorous
glance
of
his
clear
black
eye
bore
evidence
that
it
was
highly
probable
be
foul
injustice
said
the
purser
with
a
quiet
laugh
if
i
were
to
deny
that
maggot
is
a
good
man
and
true
in
the
matter
of
wrestling
nevertheless
he
is
an
arrant
rogue
and
defrauds
the
revenue
woefully
but
after
all
he
is
only
the
those
who
employ
him
are
the
real
sinners
eh
mr
donnithorne
surely
surely
replied
the
old
gentleman
with
much
gravity
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
this
accident
will
have
the
effect
of
turning
maggot
from
his
evil
ways
the
purser
could
not
refrain
from
a
laugh
at
the
hypocritical
solemnity
of
the
old
gentleman
who
was
he
well
knew
one
of
the
very
sinners
whom
he
condemned
with
such
righteous
indignation
but
their
arrival
at
maggot
cottage
prevented
further
conversation
on
the
subject
at
that
time
mrs
maggot
although
a
good
deal
agitated
when
her
husband
almost
inanimate
and
bloody
form
was
carried
in
and
laid
on
the
bed
was
by
no
means
overcome
with
alarm
she
like
the
wives
of
just
miners
generally
was
too
well
accustomed
to
hear
of
accidents
and
to
see
their
results
to
give
way
to
wild
fears
before
she
had
learned
the
extent
of
her
calamity
so
when
she
found
that
it
was
not
serious
she
dried
her
eyes
and
busied
herself
in
attending
to
all
the
little
duties
which
the
occasion
required
little
grace
too
although
terribly
frightened
and
very
pale
was
quite
and
went
about
the
house
assisting
her
mother
ably
despite
the
tendency
to
sob
which
she
found
it
very
difficult
to
overcome
but
the
baby
behaved
in
the
most
shameful
and
outrageous
manner
his
naughtiness
is
almost
indescribable
the
instant
the
door
opened
and
his
father
bloody
face
was
presented
to
view
baby
set
up
a
roar
so
tremendous
that
a
number
of
dogs
in
the
neighbourhood
struck
in
with
a
loud
chorus
and
the
black
kitten
startled
out
of
an
innocent
slumber
rushed
incontinently
under
the
bed
faced
about
and
fuffed
in
impotent
dismay
but
not
only
did
baby
roar
he
also
fell
on
the
floor
and
kicked
thereby
rendering
his
noise
exasperating
besides
exposing
his
fat
person
to
the
risk
of
being
trod
upon
zackey
was
therefore
told
off
as
a
detachment
to
keep
this
enemy
in
check
a
duty
which
he
performed
nobly
until
his
worthy
father
was
comfortably
put
to
bed
after
which
the
friends
retired
and
left
the
smith
to
the
tender
care
of
his
own
family
he
has
done
good
service
anyhow
observed
mr
donnithorne
to
his
nephew
as
he
parted
from
him
that
evening
for
he
has
cleared
the
mine
of
water
that
it
would
have
cost
hundreds
of
pounds
and
many
months
to
pump
out
chapter
eleven
shows
that
music
hath
charms
and
also
that
it
sometimes
has
disadvantages
one
morning
not
long
after
his
arrival
at
just
the
young
doctor
went
out
to
make
a
round
of
professional
visits
he
had
on
his
way
to
pass
the
cottage
of
his
uncle
which
stood
a
little
apart
from
the
chief
square
or
triangle
of
the
town
and
had
a
small
piece
of
ground
in
front
here
rose
was
wont
to
cultivate
her
namesakes
and
other
flowers
with
her
own
fair
hands
and
here
mr
thomas
donnithorne
refreshed
himself
each
evening
with
a
pipe
of
tobacco
the
flavour
of
which
was
inexpressibly
enhanced
to
him
by
the
knowledge
that
it
had
been
smuggled
he
was
in
the
habit
of
washing
the
taste
of
the
same
away
each
night
before
retiring
to
rest
with
a
glass
of
brandy
and
water
hot
which
was
likewise
improved
in
flavour
by
the
same
interesting
association
the
windows
of
the
cottage
were
wide
open
for
no
atlantic
fog
dimmed
the
glory
of
the
summer
sun
that
morning
and
the
light
air
that
came
up
from
the
mighty
sea
was
fresh
and
agreeably
cool
as
oliver
approached
the
end
of
the
cottage
he
observed
that
rose
was
not
at
her
accustomed
work
in
the
garden
and
he
was
about
to
pass
the
door
when
the
tones
of
a
guitar
struck
his
ear
and
arrested
his
step
he
was
surprised
for
at
that
period
the
instrument
was
not
much
used
and
the
town
of
just
was
naturally
the
last
place
in
the
land
where
he
would
have
expected
to
meet
with
one
no
air
was
played
only
a
few
chords
were
lightly
touched
by
fingers
which
were
evidently
expert
presently
a
female
voice
was
heard
to
sing
in
rich
contralto
tones
the
air
was
extremely
simple
and
very
beautiful
at
least
so
thought
oliver
as
he
leaned
against
a
wall
and
listened
to
the
words
these
also
were
simple
enough
but
sounded
both
sweet
and
sensible
to
the
listener
coming
as
they
did
from
a
woman
lips
so
tunefully
and
sounding
the
praises
of
the
sea
of
which
he
was
passionately
fond
song
i
love
the
land
where
acres
broad
are
clothed
in
yellow
grain
where
cot
of
thrall
and
lordly
hall
lie
scattered
the
plain
oh
i
have
trod
the
velvet
sod
beneath
the
beechwood
tree
and
roamed
the
brake
by
stream
and
lake
where
peace
and
plenty
be
but
more
than
plain
or
rich
domain
i
love
the
bright
blue
sea
i
love
the
land
where
bracken
grows
and
mountains
rise
where
peaks
still
fringed
with
winter
snows
tower
in
the
summer
skies
oh
i
have
seen
the
red
and
green
of
fir
and
rowan
tree
and
heard
the
din
of
flooded
linn
with
bleating
on
the
lea
but
better
still
than
hill
i
love
the
stormy
sea
the
air
ceased
and
oliver
stepping
in
at
the
open
door
found
rose
ellis
with
a
spanish
guitar
resting
on
her
knee
she
neither
blushed
nor
started
up
nor
looked
confused
which
was
of
course
very
strange
of
her
in
the
circumstances
seeing
that
she
is
the
heroine
of
this
tale
but
rising
with
a
smile
on
her
pretty
mouth
shook
hands
with
the
youth
why
cousin
said
oliver
i
had
no
idea
you
could
sing
so
charmingly
i
am
fond
of
singing
said
rose
so
am
i
especially
when
i
hear
such
singing
as
yours
and
the
song
too
i
like
it
much
for
it
praises
the
sea
where
did
you
pick
it
up
i
got
it
from
the
composer
a
young
midshipman
said
rose
sadly
at
the
same
time
a
slight
blush
tinged
her
brow
oliver
felt
a
peculiar
sensation
which
he
could
not
account
for
and
was
about
to
make
further
inquiries
into
the
authorship
of
the
song
when
it
occurred
to
him
that
this
would
be
impolite
and
might
be
awkward
so
he
asked
instead
how
she
had
become
possessed
of
so
fine
a
guitar
before
she
could
reply
mr
donnithorne
entered
how
do
oliver
lad
going
your
rounds
eh
come
rose
let
have
breakfast
lass
you
were
not
wont
to
be
behind
with
it
i
be
bound
this
gay
gallant
this
with
his
eyes
shut
has
been
praising
your
voice
and
puffing
up
your
heart
but
do
believe
him
rose
it
the
fashion
of
these
fellows
to
tell
lies
on
such
matters
you
do
me
injustice
uncle
said
oliver
with
a
laugh
but
even
if
it
were
true
that
i
am
addicted
to
falsehood
in
praising
women
it
were
impossible
in
the
present
instance
to
give
way
to
my
propensity
for
truth
herself
would
find
it
difficult
to
select
an
expression
sufficiently
appropriate
to
apply
to
the
beautiful
voice
of
rose
ellis
young
man
exclaimed
mr
donnithorne
as
he
carefully
filled
his
pipe
with
precious
weed
your
oratorical
powers
are
uncommon
surely
thy
talents
had
been
better
bestowed
in
the
church
or
at
the
bar
than
in
the
sickroom
or
the
hospital
demosthenes
himself
would
have
paled
before
thee
lad
though
if
truth
must
be
told
there
is
a
dash
more
sound
than
sense
in
thine
eloquence
sense
uncle
surely
your
own
good
sense
must
compel
you
to
admit
that
rose
sings
splendidly
well
i
wo
gainsay
it
replied
mr
donnithorne
now
that
rose
has
left
the
room
for
i
do
much
care
to
bespatter
folk
with
too
much
praise
to
their
faces
the
child
has
indeed
a
sweet
pipe
of
her
own
by
the
way
you
were
asking
about
her
guitar
when
i
came
in
i
tell
you
about
that
its
history
is
somewhat
curious
said
mr
donnithorne
passing
his
fingers
through
the
bunch
of
gay
ribbons
that
hung
from
the
head
of
the
instrument
you
have
heard
i
dare
say
of
the
burning
of
penzance
by
the
spaniards
more
than
two
hundred
years
ago
in
the
year
i
think
it
was
i
have
answered
oliver
but
i
know
nothing
beyond
the
fact
that
such
an
event
took
place
i
should
like
to
hear
the
details
of
it
exceedingly
well
continued
the
old
gentleman
our
country
was
as
you
know
at
war
with
spain
at
the
time
but
it
no
more
entered
into
the
heads
of
cornishmen
that
the
spaniards
would
dare
to
land
on
our
shores
than
that
the
giants
would
rise
from
their
graves
there
was
indeed
an
old
prediction
that
such
an
event
would
happen
but
the
prediction
was
either
forgotten
or
not
believed
so
that
when
several
spanish
galleys
suddenly
made
their
appearance
in
mounts
bay
and
landed
about
two
hundred
men
near
mousehole
the
inhabitants
were
taken
by
surprise
before
they
could
arm
and
defend
themselves
the
spaniards
effected
a
landing
began
to
devastate
the
country
and
set
fire
to
the
adjacent
houses
it
is
false
continued
the
old
man
sternly
to
say
as
has
been
said
by
some
that
the
men
of
mousehole
were
seized
with
panic
and
that
those
of
newlyn
and
penzance
deserted
their
houses
the
truth
is
that
the
suddenness
of
the
attack
and
their
unprepared
condition
to
repel
it
threw
the
people
into
temporary
confusion
and
forced
them
to
retreat
as
all
history
shows
us
the
best
and
bravest
will
do
at
times
in
mousehole
the
principal
inhabitant
was
killed
by
a
so
that
deprived
of
their
leading
spirit
at
the
critical
moment
when
a
leader
was
necessary
it
is
no
wonder
that
at
the
fishermen
were
driven
back
by
men
trained
to
act
in
concert
to
fire
the
houses
was
the
work
of
a
few
minutes
the
spaniards
then
rushed
on
to
newlyn
and
penzance
and
fired
these
places
also
after
which
they
returned
to
their
ships
intending
to
land
the
next
day
and
renew
their
work
of
destruction
but
that
night
was
well
spent
by
the
enraged
townsmen
they
organised
themselves
as
well
as
they
could
in
the
circumstances
and
when
day
came
attacked
the
spaniards
with
guns
and
bows
and
that
so
effectively
that
the
dons
were
glad
to
hoist
their
sails
and
run
out
of
the
bay
well
you
must
know
there
was
one
of
the
spaniards
who
it
has
been
said
either
from
bravado
or
vanity
or
a
desire
to
insult
the
english
or
from
all
three
motives
together
brought
a
guitar
on
shore
with
him
at
mousehole
and
sang
and
played
to
his
comrades
while
they
were
burning
the
houses
this
man
left
his
guitar
with
those
who
were
left
to
guard
the
boats
and
accompanied
the
others
to
penzance
on
his
return
he
again
took
his
guitar
and
going
up
to
a
high
point
of
the
cliff
so
that
he
might
be
seen
by
his
companions
and
heard
by
any
of
the
english
who
chanced
to
be
in
hiding
near
the
place
sang
several
songs
of
defiance
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
even
went
the
length
of
performing
a
spanish
dance
to
the
great
amusement
of
his
comrades
below
who
were
embarking
in
their
boats
while
the
spaniard
was
going
on
thus
he
little
knew
that
not
three
yards
distant
from
him
a
gigantic
mousehole
fisherman
who
went
by
the
name
of
gurnet
lay
concealed
among
some
low
bushes
watching
his
proceedings
with
an
expression
of
anger
on
his
big
stern
countenance
when
the
boats
were
nearly
ready
to
start
the
spaniard
descended
from
the
rocky
ledge
on
which
he
had
been
performing
intending
to
rejoin
his
comrades
he
had
to
pass
round
the
bush
where
gurnet
lay
concealed
and
in
doing
so
was
for
a
few
seconds
hid
from
his
comrades
who
immediately
forgot
him
in
the
bustle
of
departure
or
if
they
thought
of
him
at
all
each
boat
crew
imagined
no
doubt
that
he
was
with
one
of
the
others
but
he
never
reached
the
boats
as
he
passed
the
bush
gurnet
sprang
on
him
like
a
tiger
and
seized
him
round
the
throat
with
both
hands
choking
a
shout
that
was
coming
up
and
causing
his
eyes
to
start
almost
out
of
his
head
without
uttering
a
word
and
only
giving
now
and
then
a
terrible
hiss
through
his
clenched
teeth
gurnet
pushed
the
spaniard
before
him
keeping
carefully
out
of
sight
of
the
beach
and
holding
him
fast
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
so
that
when
he
perceived
the
slightest
symptom
of
a
tendency
to
cry
out
he
had
only
to
press
his
strong
fingers
and
effectually
nip
it
in
the
bud
he
led
him
to
a
secluded
place
among
the
rocks
far
beyond
earshot
of
the
shore
and
there
setting
him
free
pointed
to
a
flat
rock
and
to
his
guitar
and
hissed
rather
than
said
in
tones
that
could
neither
be
misunderstood
nor
gainsaid
dance
and
sing
will
till
gurnet
clenched
his
huge
fist
as
he
spoke
and
as
the
spaniard
grew
pale
and
hesitated
he
shook
it
close
to
his
face
so
close
that
he
tapped
the
prominent
bridge
of
the
man
nose
and
hissed
again
more
fiercely
than
before
haaf
saved
bucca

mazed

i
will
in
justice
to
the
narrator
it
is
right
to
say
that
these
words
are
not
so
bad
as
they
sound
the
fisherman
look
and
action
were
so
terrible
whilst
he
poured
forth
his
wrath
which
was
kept
alive
by
the
thought
of
the
smouldering
embers
of
his
own
cottage
that
the
spaniard
could
not
but
obey
with
a
ludicrous
compound
of
fun
and
terror
he
began
to
dance
and
sing
or
rather
to
leap
and
wail
while
gurnet
stood
before
him
with
a
look
of
grim
ferocity
that
never
for
a
moment
relaxed
whenever
the
spaniard
stopped
from
exhaustion
gurnet
shouted
on
in
a
voice
of
thunder
and
the
poor
man
being
thoroughly
terrified
went
on
until
he
fell
to
the
ground
incapable
of
further
exertion
up
to
this
point
gurnet
had
kept
saying
to
himself
is
fond
dancin
an
singin
let
un
have
it
then
but
when
the
poor
man
fell
his
heart
relented
he
picked
him
up
threw
him
across
his
shoulder
as
if
he
had
been
a
bolster
and
bore
him
away
at
first
the
men
of
the
place
wanted
to
hang
him
on
the
spot
but
gurnet
claimed
him
as
his
prisoner
and
would
not
allow
this
he
gave
him
his
liberty
and
the
poor
wretch
maintained
himself
for
many
a
day
as
a
wandering
minstrel
at
last
he
managed
to
get
on
board
of
a
spanish
vessel
and
was
never
more
heard
of
but
he
left
his
guitar
behind
him
it
was
picked
up
on
the
shore
where
he
left
it
probably
in
his
haste
to
get
away
the
truth
of
this
story
of
course
i
can
not
vouch
for
concluded
mr
donnithorne
with
a
smile
but
i
have
told
it
to
you
as
nearly
as
possible
in
the
words
in
which
i
have
often
heard
my
grandfather
give
it
and
as
for
the
guitar
why
here
it
is
having
been
sold
to
me
by
a
descendant
of
the
man
who
found
it
on
the
seashore
a
wonderful
story
indeed
said
oliver
the
guitar
you
must
admit
is
at
least
a
fact
said
the
old
gentleman
oliver
not
only
admitted
this
but
said
it
was
a
fact
and
was
proceeding
to
comment
further
on
the
subject
when
mr
donnithorne
interrupted
him
by
the
way
talking
of
sweet
sounds
have
you
heard
what
that
scoundrel
maggot
that
roaring
bull
of
bashan
has
been
about
lately
no
i
have
not
said
oliver
who
saw
that
the
old
gentleman
ire
was
rising
ha
lad
that
man
ought
to
be
hanged
he
is
an
arrant
knave
a
smuggler
a
an
ungrateful
rascal
why
sir
you
scarcely
believe
it
he
has
come
to
me
and
demanded
more
money
for
the
jewels
which
he
and
his
comrade
sold
me
in
fair
and
open
bargain
and
because
i
refused
and
called
him
a
few
names
he
has
actually
gone
and
given
information
against
me
as
possessor
of
treasure
which
of
right
so
they
say
belongs
to
government
and
last
night
i
had
a
letter
which
tells
me
that
the
treasure
as
they
call
it
must
be
delivered
up
without
delay
on
pain
of
i
do
know
what
penalties
penalties
forsooth
as
if
i
had
been
punished
enough
already
by
the
harassing
of
my
wife
ever
since
the
unlucky
day
when
the
baubles
were
found
not
to
mention
the
uneasy
probings
of
my
own
conscience
which
to
say
truth
i
had
feared
was
dead
altogether
owing
to
the
villainous
moral
atmosphere
of
this
smuggling
place
but
which
i
find
quite
lively
and
strong
yet
a
matter
of
some
consolation
too
for
although
i
do
have
a
weakness
for
cheap
and
brandy
being
of
an
economical
turn
of
mind
i
do
like
the
notion
of
getting
rid
of
my
conscience
altogether
but
man
is
hard
to
bear
poor
mr
donnithorne
stopped
here
partly
owing
to
shortness
of
breath
and
partly
because
he
had
excited
himself
to
a
pitch
that
rendered
coherent
speech
difficult
would
it
not
be
well
at
once
to
relieve
your
conscience
sir
suggested
oliver
respectfully
by
giving
up
the
things
that
cause
it
pain
in
my
profession
we
always
try
to
get
at
the
root
of
a
disease
and
apply
our
remedies
there
ha
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
wiping
his
heated
brow
and
lose
twenty
pounds
as
a
sort
of
fee
to
doctor
maggot
who
like
other
doctors
i
wot
of
created
the
disease
himself
and
who
will
certainly
never
attempt
to
alleviate
it
by
returning
the
fee
still
the
disease
may
be
cured
by
the
remedy
i
recommend
said
oliver
no
man
it
ca
cried
the
old
gentleman
with
a
perplexed
expression
because
the
dirty
things
are
already
sold
and
the
money
is
invested
in
botallack
shares
to
sell
which
and
pay
back
the
cash
in
the
present
depressed
state
of
things
would
be
utter
madness
but
hush
here
comes
my
better
half
and
although
she
a
dear
good
soul
with
an
unusual
amount
of
wisdom
for
her
size
it
would
be
injudicious
to
prolong
the
lectures
of
the
night
into
the
early
hours
of
morning
as
he
spoke
little
mrs
donnithorne
round
face
appeared
like
the
rising
sun
in
the
doorway
and
her
cheery
voice
welcomed
oliver
to
breakfast
thank
you
aunt
said
oliver
but
i
have
already
breakfasted
more
than
an
hour
ago
and
am
on
my
way
to
visit
my
patients
indeed
i
have
to
blame
myself
for
calling
at
so
early
an
hour
and
would
not
have
done
so
but
for
the
irresistible
attraction
of
a
newly
discovered
voice
which
come
come
youngster
interrupted
mr
donnithorne
be
pleased
to
bear
in
remembrance
that
the
voice
is
connected
with
a
pair
of
capital
ears
remarkable
for
their
sharpness
if
not
their
length
and
at
no
great
distance
off
i
warrant
you
do
rose
injustice
observed
mrs
donnithorne
as
the
voice
at
that
moment
broke
out
into
a
lively
carol
in
the
region
of
the
kitchen
whither
its
owner
had
gone
to
superintend
culinary
matters
but
tell
me
oliver
have
you
heard
of
the
accident
to
poor
batten
yes
i
saw
him
yesterday
replied
the
doctor
just
after
the
accident
happened
and
i
am
anxious
about
him
i
fear
though
i
am
not
quite
certain
that
his
eyesight
is
destroyed
dear
dear
oh
poor
man
said
mrs
donnithorne
whose
sympathetic
heart
swelled
while
her
blue
eyes
instantly
filled
with
tears
it
is
so
very
sad
oliver
for
his
delicate
wife
and
four
young
children
are
entirely
dependent
upon
him
and
his
two
sons
and
they
found
it
difficult
enough
to
make
the
two
ends
meet
even
when
they
were
all
in
health
for
it
is
hard
times
among
the
miners
at
present
as
you
know
oliver
and
now
dear
dear
it
is
very
sad
little
mrs
donnithorne
said
nothing
more
at
that
time
but
her
mind
instantly
reverted
to
a
portly
basket
which
she
was
much
in
the
habit
of
carrying
with
her
on
her
frequent
visits
to
the
poor
and
the
sick
for
the
good
lady
was
one
of
those
whose
inclinations
as
well
as
principles
lead
them
to
consider
the
poor
it
must
not
be
imagined
however
that
the
poor
formed
a
large
class
of
the
community
in
just
the
miners
of
that
district
and
indeed
all
over
cornwall
were
and
still
are
a
independent
race
and
as
long
as
tough
thews
and
sinews
and
stout
and
willing
hearts
could
accomplish
anything
they
never
failed
to
wrench
a
subsistence
out
of
the
stubborn
rocks
which
contain
the
wealth
of
the
land
begging
goes
very
much
against
the
grain
of
a
cornishman
and
the
lowest
depth
to
which
he
can
sink
socially
in
his
own
esteem
is
that
of
being
dependent
on
charity
in
some
cases
this
sentiment
is
carried
too
far
and
has
degenerated
into
pride
for
when
god
in
his
wisdom
sees
fit
by
means
of
disabling
accident
or
declining
health
to
incapacitate
a
man
from
labour
it
is
as
honourable
in
him
to
receive
charity
as
it
is
although
not
always
sufficiently
esteemed
so
a
high
privilege
and
luxury
of
the
more
fortunate
to
give
worthy
mrs
donnithorne
charities
were
always
bestowed
with
such
delicacy
that
she
managed
in
some
mysterious
way
to
make
the
recipients
feel
as
though
they
had
done
her
a
favour
in
accepting
them
and
yet
she
was
not
a
soft
piece
of
indiscriminating
amiability
whose
chief
delight
in
giving
lay
in
the
sensations
which
the
act
created
within
her
own
breast
by
no
means
none
knew
better
than
she
when
and
where
to
give
money
and
when
to
give
blankets
bread
or
tea
she
was
equally
sharp
to
perceive
the
spirit
that
rendered
it
advisable
for
her
to
say
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
favour
there
a
good
woman
now
you
wo
refuse
me
etcetera
and
to
detect
the
spirit
that
called
forth
the
sharp
remark
accompanied
with
a
dubious
smile
and
a
shake
of
her
fat
forefinger
there
now
see
that
you
make
better
use
of
it
time
else
i
shall
have
to
scold
you
having
received
a
message
for
poor
mrs
batten
the
miner
wife
the
doctor
left
the
cottage
and
proceeded
to
pay
his
visits
let
us
accompany
him
chapter
twelve
in
which
oliver
gets
a
fall
and
sees
some
of
the
shadows
of
the
miner
life
in
crossing
a
hayfield
oliver
trembath
encountered
the
tall
bluff
figure
and
the
grave
sedate
smile
of
mr
cornish
the
manager
doctor
said
the
old
gentleman
extending
his
hand
and
giving
the
youth
a
grasp
worthy
of
one
of
the
old
cornish
giants
do
you
know
i
was
thinking
as
i
saw
you
leap
over
the
stile
that
you
would
make
a
pretty
fair
miner
thanks
sir
for
your
good
opinion
of
me
said
oliver
with
a
smile
but
i
would
rather
work
above
than
below
ground
living
the
half
of
one
life
beyond
the
reach
of
sunlight
is
not
conducive
to
health
nevertheless
the
miners
keep
their
health
pretty
well
considering
the
nature
of
their
work
replied
mr
cornish
and
you
must
admit
that
many
of
them
are
stout
fellows
you
would
find
them
so
if
you
got
one
of
their
cornish
hugs
perhaps
said
oliver
with
a
modest
look
for
he
had
been
a
noted
wrestler
at
school
i
might
give
them
a
pretty
fair
hug
in
return
for
cornish
blood
flows
in
my
veins
a
fig
for
blood
doctor
it
is
of
no
avail
without
knowledge
and
practice
as
well
as
muscle
these
however
i
do
acknowledge
that
it
makes
weight
if
by
you
mean
high
spirit
by
the
way
how
comes
it
sir
said
oliver
that
cornishmen
are
so
much
more
addicted
to
wrestling
than
other
englishmen
it
were
hard
to
tell
doctor
unless
it
be
that
they
feel
themselves
stronger
than
other
englishmen
and
being
accustomed
to
violent
exertion
more
than
others
they
take
greater
pleasure
in
it
undoubtedly
the
greeks
introduced
it
among
us
but
whether
they
practised
it
as
we
now
do
can
not
be
certainly
ascertained
here
mr
cornish
entered
into
an
enthusiastic
account
of
the
art
of
wrestling
related
many
anecdotes
of
his
own
prowess
in
days
gone
by
and
explained
the
peculiar
method
of
performing
the
throw
by
the
heel
the
toe
and
the
hip
the
heave
forward
the
and
the
cornish
hug
to
all
of
which
the
youth
listened
with
deep
interest
i
should
like
much
to
witness
one
of
your
he
said
when
the
old
gentleman
concluded
for
i
can
not
imagine
that
any
of
your
peculiar
cornish
hugs
or
twists
can
be
so
potent
as
to
overturn
a
stout
fellow
who
is
accustomed
to
wrestle
in
another
fashion
can
you
show
me
one
of
the
particular
grips
or
twists
that
are
said
to
be
so
effective
i
think
i
can
replied
the
old
gentleman
with
a
smile
and
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
of
course
the
style
of
grip
and
throw
will
vary
according
to
the
size
of
the
man
one
has
to
deal
with
give
me
hold
of
your
wrist
and
plant
yourself
firmly
on
your
legs
now
you
see
you
must
turn
the
arm
so
and
use
your
toe
thus
so
as
to
lift
your
man
and
with
a
sudden
twist
there
that
the
way
to
do
it
said
the
old
gentleman
with
a
chuckle
as
he
threw
oliver
head
foremost
into
the
middle
of
a
haycock
that
lay
opportunely
near
it
is
hard
to
say
whether
mr
cornish
or
oliver
was
most
surprised
at
the
result
of
the
effort
the
one
that
so
much
of
his
ancient
prowess
should
remain
and
the
other
that
he
should
have
been
so
easily
overthrown
by
one
who
although
fully
as
large
a
man
as
himself
had
his
joints
and
muscles
somewhat
stiffened
by
age
oliver
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
on
rising
and
exclaimed
well
done
sir
you
have
effectually
convinced
me
that
there
is
something
worth
knowing
in
the
cornish
mode
of
wrestling
although
had
i
known
what
you
were
about
to
do
it
might
not
perhaps
have
been
done
so
easily
i
doubt
it
not
said
mr
cornish
with
a
laugh
but
that
shows
the
value
of
in
such
matters
doctor
hope
find
your
patients
getting
on
well
he
waved
his
hand
as
he
turned
off
while
oliver
pursued
his
way
to
the
miners
cottages
the
first
he
entered
belonged
to
a
man
whose
chest
was
slightly
affected
for
the
first
time
he
was
a
stout
man
about
years
of
age
and
of
temperate
habits
took
a
little
beer
occasionally
but
never
exceeded
had
a
good
appetite
but
had
caught
cold
frequently
in
consequence
of
having
to
go
a
considerable
distance
from
the
mouth
to
the
while
exhausted
with
hard
work
underground
and
covered
with
profuse
perspiration
often
he
had
to
do
this
in
wet
weather
and
when
bitterly
cold
winds
were
blowing
of
late
he
had
begun
to
spit
blood
it
is
necessary
here
to
remind
the
reader
that
matters
in
this
respect
and
in
reference
to
the
condition
of
the
miner
generally
are
now
much
improved
the
besides
being
placed
as
near
to
the
several
shafts
as
is
convenient
are
now
warmed
with
fires
and
supplied
with
so
that
the
men
have
a
comfortable
place
in
which
to
wash
themselves
on
coming
to
grass
and
find
their
clothes
thoroughly
dried
when
they
return
in
the
morning
to
put
them
on
before
going
underground
this
renders
them
less
liable
to
catch
cold
but
of
course
does
not
protect
them
from
the
evil
influences
of
climbing
the
ladders
and
of
bad
air
few
men
have
to
undergo
such
severe
toil
as
the
cornish
miner
because
of
the
extreme
hardness
of
the
rock
with
which
he
has
to
deal
to
be
bathed
in
perspiration
and
engaged
in
almost
unremitting
and
violent
muscular
exertion
during
at
least
eight
hours
of
each
day
may
be
said
to
be
his
normal
condition
oliver
advised
this
man
to
give
up
underground
work
for
some
time
and
having
prescribed
for
him
and
spoken
encouragingly
to
his
wife
left
the
cottage
to
continue
his
rounds
several
cases
more
or
less
similar
to
the
above
followed
each
other
in
succession
also
one
or
two
cases
of
slight
illness
among
the
children
which
caused
more
alarm
to
the
anxious
mothers
than
there
was
any
occasion
for
these
latter
were
quickly
but
disposed
of
and
the
young
doctor
generally
left
a
good
impression
behind
him
for
he
had
a
hearty
though
prompt
manner
and
a
sympathetic
spirit
at
one
cottage
he
found
a
young
man
in
the
last
stage
of
consumption
he
lay
on
his
lowly
bed
pale
and
restless
almost
wishing
for
death
to
relieve
him
of
his
pains
his
young
wife
sat
by
his
bedside
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
while
a
little
boy
romped
about
the
room
unnoticed
ignorant
that
the
hour
was
drawing
near
which
would
render
him
fatherless
and
his
young
mother
a
widow
this
young
man
had
been
a
daring
fellow
whose
animal
spirits
led
him
into
many
a
reckless
deed
his
complaint
had
been
brought
on
by
racing
up
the
ladders
a
had
given
way
and
he
had
never
rallied
after
just
as
oliver
was
leaving
him
a
wesleyan
minister
entered
the
dwelling
he
wo
be
long
with
us
doctor
i
fear
he
said
in
passing
not
long
sir
replied
oliver
his
release
will
be
a
happy
one
said
the
minister
for
his
soul
rests
on
jesus
but
alas
for
his
young
wife
and
child
he
passed
into
the
sickroom
and
the
doctor
went
on
the
next
case
was
also
a
bad
one
though
different
from
the
preceding
the
patient
was
between
forty
and
fifty
years
of
age
and
had
been
unable
to
go
underground
for
several
years
he
was
a
staid
sober
man
and
an
abstemious
liver
but
it
was
evident
that
his
life
on
earth
was
drawing
to
a
close
he
had
been
employed
chiefly
in
driving
levels
and
had
worked
a
great
deal
in
very
bad
air
where
the
candles
could
not
be
made
to
burn
unless
placed
nine
or
ten
feet
behind
the
spot
where
he
was
at
work
indeed
he
often
got
no
fresh
air
except
what
was
blown
to
him
and
only
a
puff
now
and
then
when
he
first
went
to
work
in
the
morning
the
candle
would
not
keep
alight
so
that
he
had
to
take
his
coat
and
beat
the
air
about
before
going
into
the
level
and
after
a
time
went
in
when
the
candles
could
be
got
to
burn
by
holding
them
on
one
side
and
teasing
out
the
wick
very
much
this
used
to
create
a
great
deal
of
smoke
which
tended
still
further
to
vitiate
the
air
when
he
returned
to
grass
his
saliva
used
to
be
as
black
as
ink
about
five
years
before
giving
up
underground
work
he
had
had
inflammation
of
the
lungs
followed
by
which
used
to
come
on
when
he
was
at
work
in
what
he
called
poor
air
or
in
and
he
had
never
been
well
since
oliver
last
visit
that
day
was
to
the
man
john
batten
who
had
exploded
a
in
his
face
the
day
before
this
man
dwelt
in
a
cottage
in
the
small
hamlet
of
botallack
close
to
the
mine
of
the
same
name
the
room
in
which
the
miner
lay
was
very
small
and
its
furniture
scanty
nevertheless
it
was
clean
and
neatly
arranged
everything
in
and
about
the
place
bore
evidence
of
the
presence
of
a
thrifty
hand
the
cotton
curtain
on
the
window
was
thin
and
worn
but
it
was
well
darned
and
pure
as
the
driven
snow
the
two
chairs
were
old
as
was
also
the
table
but
they
were
not
rickety
it
was
obvious
that
they
owed
their
stability
to
a
hand
skilled
in
mending
and
in
patching
pieces
of
things
together
even
the
squat
little
stool
in
the
side
of
the
chimney
corner
displayed
a
leg
the
whiteness
of
which
compared
with
the
other
two
told
of
attention
to
small
things
there
was
a
peg
for
everything
and
everything
seemed
to
be
on
its
peg
nothing
littered
the
floor
or
defiled
the
hearthstone
and
it
did
not
require
a
second
thought
on
the
part
of
the
beholder
to
ascribe
all
this
to
the
tidy
little
woman
who
with
an
expression
of
deep
anxiety
on
her
countenance
attended
to
the
wants
of
her
injured
husband
as
oliver
approached
the
door
of
this
cottage
two
stout
youths
of
about
sixteen
and
seventeen
respectively
opened
it
and
issued
forth
lads
going
to
work
i
suppose
said
oliver
iss
sur
replied
the
elder
a
ruddy
youth
who
like
his
brother
had
not
yet
sacrificed
his
colour
to
the
evil
influence
of
the
mines
we
do
work
in
the
night
corps
brother
and
me
father
is
worse
sur
sorry
to
hear
that
said
the
doctor
as
he
passed
them
and
entered
the
cottage
while
the
lads
shouldered
their
tools
and
walked
smartly
down
the
lane
that
led
to
botallack
mine
your
husband
is
not
quite
so
well
i
hear
said
the
doctor
going
to
the
side
of
the
bed
on
which
the
stalwart
form
of
the
miner
lay
no
sur
replied
the
poor
woman
he
has
much
pain
in
his
eyes
but
his
heart
is
braave
sur
i
never
do
hear
a
complaint
from
he
this
was
true
the
man
lay
perfectly
still
the
compressed
lip
and
the
perspiration
that
moistened
his
face
alone
giving
evidence
of
the
agony
he
endured
do
you
suffer
much
inquired
the
doctor
as
he
undid
the
bandages
which
covered
the
upper
part
of
the
man
face
iss
sur
i
do
was
the
reply
no
more
was
said
but
a
low
groan
escaped
the
miner
when
the
bandage
was
removed
and
the
frightful
effects
of
the
accident
were
exposed
to
view
with
intense
anxiety
mrs
batten
watched
the
doctor
countenance
but
found
no
comfort
there
a
very
brief
examination
was
sufficient
to
convince
oliver
that
the
eyes
were
utterly
destroyed
for
the
miner
had
been
so
close
to
the
hole
when
it
exploded
that
the
orbs
were
singed
by
the
flame
and
portions
of
unburnt
powder
had
been
blown
right
into
them
will
he
see
a
sur
whispered
mrs
batten
oliver
shook
his
head
i
fear
not
he
said
in
a
low
tone
speak
out
doctor
said
the
miner
in
firm
tones
i
ai
afeard
to
knaw
it
it
would
be
unkind
to
deceive
you
replied
oliver
sadly
your
eyes
are
destroyed
no
word
was
spoken
for
a
few
minutes
but
the
poor
woman
knelt
by
her
husband
side
and
nestled
close
to
him
batten
raised
his
large
brown
hand
which
bore
the
marks
and
scars
of
many
a
year
of
manly
toil
and
laid
it
gently
on
his
wife
head
i
never
see
thee
again
annie
he
murmured
in
a
low
deep
tone
but
i
see
thee
face
now
lass
as
i
saw
it
wi
the
smile
of
an
angel
o
an
i
see
it
so
till
the
day
i
die
bless
the
lord
for
that
mrs
batten
rose
and
went
softly
but
quickly
out
of
the
room
that
she
might
relieve
her
bursting
heart
without
distressing
her
husband
but
he
knew
her
too
well
to
doubt
the
reason
of
her
sudden
movement
and
a
faint
smile
was
on
his
lips
for
a
moment
as
he
said
to
oliver
gone
to
weep
a
bit
sur
and
pray
it
will
do
her
good
dear
lass
your
loss
is
a
heavy
one
very
heavy
said
oliver
with
hesitation
in
his
tone
for
he
felt
some
difficulty
in
attempting
to
comfort
one
in
so
hopeless
a
condition
true
sur
true
replied
the
man
in
a
tone
of
cheerful
resignation
that
surprised
the
doctor
but
it
might
have
been
worse
lord
gave
and
the
lord
hath
taken
away
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
lord
mrs
batten
returned
in
a
few
minutes
and
oliver
left
them
after
administering
as
much
comfort
as
he
could
in
the
circumstances
but
to
say
truth
although
well
skilled
in
alleviating
bodily
pains
he
was
incapable
of
doing
much
in
the
way
of
ministering
to
the
mind
diseased
oliver
trembath
was
not
a
medical
missionary
his
mother
though
a
good
amiable
woman
had
been
a
weak
creature
one
of
those
listless
ladies
who
may
be
regarded
as
human
vegetables
who
float
through
life
as
comfortably
as
they
can
giving
as
little
trouble
as
possible
and
doing
as
little
good
as
is
compatible
with
the
presence
of
even
nominal
christianity
she
performed
the
duties
of
life
in
the
smallest
possible
circle
the
centre
of
which
was
herself
and
the
extremity
of
the
radii
extending
to
the
walls
of
her
garden
she
went
to
church
at
the
regulation
hours
said
her
prayers
in
the
regulation
tone
of
voice
gave
her
charities
in
the
stated
way
at
stated
periods
with
a
hazy
perception
as
to
the
objects
for
which
they
were
given
and
an
easy
indifference
as
to
the
success
of
these
objects
the
whole
end
and
aim
of
her
wishes
being
attained
in
and
her
conscience
satisfied
by
the
act
of
giving
hence
her
son
oliver
was
not
much
impressed
in
youth
with
the
power
or
value
of
religion
and
hence
he
found
himself
rather
put
out
when
his
common
sense
told
him
as
it
not
unfrequently
did
that
it
was
his
duty
sometimes
to
administer
a
dose
to
the
mind
as
well
as
to
the
body
but
oliver
was
not
like
his
mother
in
any
respect
his
fire
his
energy
his
intellectual
activity
and
his
impulsive
generosity
he
inherited
from
his
father
amiability
alone
descended
to
him
from
his
mother
an
inheritance
by
the
way
not
to
be
lightly
esteemed
for
by
it
all
his
other
qualities
were
immeasurably
enhanced
in
value
his
heart
had
beat
in
sympathy
with
the
mourners
he
had
just
left
and
his
manly
disposition
made
him
feel
ashamed
that
the
lips
which
could
give
advice
glibly
enough
in
regard
to
bandages
and
physic
and
which
could
speak
in
cheery
comforting
tones
when
there
was
hope
for
his
patient
were
sealed
and
absolutely
incapable
of
utterance
when
death
approached
or
hopeless
despair
took
possession
of
the
sufferer
oliver
had
felt
something
of
this
even
in
his
student
life
when
the
solemnities
of
sickness
and
death
were
new
to
him
but
it
was
pressed
home
upon
him
with
peculiar
power
and
his
manhood
was
often
put
to
the
blush
when
he
was
brought
into
contact
with
the
wesleyan
methodism
of
west
cornwall
where
multitudes
of
men
and
women
of
all
grades
drew
comfort
from
the
scriptures
as
readily
and
as
earnestly
as
they
drew
water
from
their
wells
where
religion
was
mingled
with
everyday
and
household
duties
and
where
many
of
the
miners
and
fishermen
preached
and
prayed
and
comforted
one
another
with
god
word
as
vigorously
as
simply
and
as
naturally
as
they
hewed
a
livelihood
from
the
rocks
or
drew
sustenance
from
the
sea
chapter
thirteen
treats
of
spirits
and
of
sundry
spirited
matters
and
incidents
one
sunny
afternoon
mrs
maggot
found
herself
in
the
happy
position
of
having
so
thoroughly
completed
her
round
of
household
work
that
she
felt
at
leisure
to
sit
down
and
sew
while
little
grace
sat
beside
her
near
the
open
door
rocking
the
cradle
baby
in
blissful
unconsciousness
of
its
own
existence
lay
sound
asleep
with
a
thumb
in
its
mouth
the
resolute
sucking
of
that
thumb
having
been
its
most
recent
act
of
disobedience
little
grace
was
flushed
and
rather
dishevelled
for
it
had
cost
her
half
an
hour
hard
wrestling
to
get
baby
placed
in
recumbent
somnolence
she
now
sought
to
soothe
her
feelings
by
tickling
the
chin
of
the
black
kitten
a
process
to
which
that
active
creature
submitted
with
purring
satisfaction
faither
long
of
coming
hum
mother
said
little
grace
looking
up
iss
replied
mrs
maggot
knaw
where
he
is
inquired
grace
no
i
doa
replied
her
mother
it
was
evident
that
mrs
maggot
was
not
in
the
humour
for
conversation
so
grace
relapsed
into
silence
and
devoted
herself
to
the
kitten
is
that
faither
said
grace
after
a
few
minutes
pointing
to
the
figure
of
a
man
who
was
seen
coming
over
the
distant
moor
or
waste
land
which
at
that
period
surrounded
the
town
of
just
though
the
greater
part
of
it
is
now
cultivated
fields
it
isn
like
un
said
mrs
maggot
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
sure
it
do
look
like
a
boatsman
the
men
of
the
coastguard
were
called
boatsmen
at
that
time
iss
i
do
see
his
cutlash
said
little
grace
and
there
another
man
comin
down
road
to
meet
un
haste
grace
cried
mrs
maggot
leaping
up
and
plucking
her
out
of
the
cradle
take
the
cheeld
in
to
mrs
penrose
bide
theer
till
i
send
for
dost
a
hear
plucked
thus
unceremoniously
from
gentle
slumber
to
be
plunged
headlong
and
without
preparation
into
fierce
infantine
war
was
too
much
for
baby
maggot
he
uttered
one
yell
of
rage
and
defiance
which
was
succeeded
by
a
lull
a
sort
of
pause
for
the
recovery
of
breath
so
prolonged
that
the
obedient
grace
had
time
to
fling
down
the
chet
catch
baby
in
her
arms
and
bear
him
into
the
neighbouring
cottage
before
the
next
roar
came
forth
the
youthful
maggot
was
at
once
received
into
the
bosom
of
the
penrose
family
and
succeeding
yells
were
smothered
by
eight
out
of
the
sixteen
penroses
who
chanced
to
be
at
home
at
the
time
that
mrs
maggot
had
a
guilty
conscience
might
have
been
inferred
from
her
future
proceedings
which
to
one
unacquainted
with
the
habits
of
her
husband
would
have
appeared
strange
if
not
quite
unaccountable
when
baby
was
borne
off
as
related
she
seized
a
small
keg
which
stood
in
a
corner
near
the
door
and
smelt
strongly
of
brandy
and
placing
it
with
great
care
in
the
vacant
cradle
covered
it
over
with
blankets
she
next
rolled
a
pair
of
stockings
into
a
ball
and
tied
on
it
a
little
frilled
which
she
disposed
on
the
pillow
with
the
face
pretty
well
down
and
the
back
of
the
head
pretty
well
up
and
so
judiciously
and
cleverly
covered
it
with
bedclothes
that
even
maggot
himself
might
have
failed
to
miss
his
son
or
to
recognise
the
outlines
of
a
keg
a
bottle
half
full
of
brandy
with
the
cork
out
was
next
placed
on
the
table
to
account
for
the
odour
in
the
room
and
then
mrs
maggot
sat
down
to
her
sewing
and
rocked
the
cradle
gently
with
her
foot
singing
a
sweet
lullaby
the
while
ten
minutes
later
two
stout
men
of
the
coastguard
armed
with
cutlasses
and
pistols
entered
the
cottage
mrs
maggot
observed
that
they
were
also
armed
with
a
pick
and
shovel
missus

the
man
who
walked

mrs

said
they
were
welcome
to
do
as
they
pleased
if
they
would
only
do
it
quietly
for
the
sake
of
the
cheeld
so
without
more
ado
they
commenced
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
premises
outside
and
in
then
they
went
to
the
smithy
where
mrs
maggot
knew
her
husband
had
concealed
two
large
kegs
of
smuggled
liquor
on
the
hearth
under
a
heap
of
ashes
and
iron
debris
but
these
had
been
so
cleverly
yet
carelessly
hidden
that
the
men
sat
down
on
the
heap
under
which
they
lay
to
rest
and
wipe
their
heated
brows
after
their
fruitless
search
hast
found
the
brandy
inquired
mrs
maggot
with
a
look
of
innocence
when
the
two
men
returned
not
yet
replied
eben
trezise
but
we
not
done
there
a
certain
shaft
near
by
that
has
got
a
bad
name
for
drinkin
missus
you
may
have
heard
on
it
its
breath
do
smell
dreadful
bad
sometimes
both
men
laughed
at
this
and
winked
to
each
other
while
mrs
maggot
smiled
and
with
a
look
of
surprise
vowed
that
she
had
not
heard
of
the
disreputable
shaft
referred
to
despite
her
unconcerned
look
however
mrs
maggot
felt
anxious
for
she
was
aware
that
her
husband
had
recently
obtained
an
unusually
large
quantity
of
french
brandy
and
tobacco
from
the
scilly
islands
between
which
and
the
coasts
of
cornwall
smuggling
was
carried
on
in
a
most
daring
and
extensive
manner
at
the
time
of
our
story
and
she
knew
that
the
whole
of
the
smuggled
goods
lay
concealed
in
one
of
those
numerous
disused
shafts
of
old
mines
which
lie
scattered
thickly
over
that
part
of
the
country
maggot
absence
rendered
her
position
still
more
perplexing
but
she
was
a
woman
of
ready
wit
and
and
she
comforted
herself
with
the
knowledge
that
the
brandy
lay
buried
far
down
in
the
shaft
and
that
it
would
take
the
boatsmen
some
time
to
dig
to
it
that
possibly
they
might
give
up
in
despair
before
reaching
it
while
the
men
went
off
to
search
for
the
shaft
and
while
mrs
maggot
was
calmly
nursing
her
spirited
little
baby
maggot
himself
in
company
with
his
bosom
friend
john
cock
was
sauntering
slowly
homeward
along
the
cliffs
near
kenidjack
castle
the
ruins
of
which
occupy
a
bold
promontory
a
little
to
the
north
of
cape
cornwall
they
had
just
come
in
sight
of
the
and
works
which
cover
nancharrow
valley
from
the
shore
to
a
considerable
distance
inland
where
stand
the
tall
chimneys
and
the
whims
and
varied
machinery
of
the
extensive
and
prolific
old
named
wheal
owles
the
cliffs
on
which
the
two
men
stood
are
very
precipitous
and
rugged
rising
in
some
places
to
a
height
of
about
feet
above
the
rocks
where
the
waters
of
the
atlantic
roll
dark
and
deep
fringing
the
coast
with
a
milky
foam
that
is
carried
away
by
the
tide
in
long
streaks
to
be
defiled
by
the
red
waters
which
flow
from
nancharrow
valley
into
porth
ledden
cove
this
cove
is
a
small
one
with
a
narrow
strip
of
sand
on
its
shore
at
its
northern
extremity
is
a
deep
narrow
gorge
into
which
the
waves
rush
even
in
calm
weather
with
a
peculiar
sound
in
reference
to
this
it
is
said
that
the
waves
hence
the
place
has
been
named
zawn
buzzangein
the
sides
of
the
zawn
are
about
sixty
feet
high
and
quite
precipitous
in
one
part
especially
they
overhang
their
base
it
was
here
that
maggot
and
his
friend
stopped
on
their
way
home
and
turned
to
look
out
upon
the
sea
no
sign
o
pilchers
yet
observed
maggot
referring
to
the
immense
shoals
of
pilchards
which
visit
the
cornish
coasts
in
the
autumn
of
each
year
and
form
a
large
portion
of
the
wealth
of
the
county
too
soon
replied
john
cock
by
the
way
jack
said
maggot
was
it
hereabouts
that
the
schooner
went
ashore
last
winter
iss
down
theer
close
by
pullandeese
replied
the
other
pointing
to
a
deep
pool
in
the
rocks
round
which
the
swell
of
the
atlantic
broke
in
white
foam
i
was
theere
myself
i
had
come
down
daylight
before
others
were
stirring
an
sure
there
she
lay
on
the
rocks
bottom
up
an
all
the
crew
lost
we
seed
wan
them
knackin
on
the
rocks
to
the
north
so
we
got
ropes
an
let
a
man
down
to
fetch
un
up
but
of
coorse
it
was
gone
dead
that
minds
me
jack
said
maggot
that
i
seed
a
daw
nest
here
the
last
time
i
come
along
so
lev
us
go
an
stroob
that
daw
nest
thee
cus
do
it
said
john
cock
maggot
laughed
and
said
he
not
only
could
but
would
so
he
ran
down
to
the
neighbouring
works
and
returned
with
a
stout
rope
which
he
fixed
firmly
to
a
rock
at
the
edge
of
the
overhanging
cliff
we
have
already
said
that
maggot
was
a
noted
madcap
who
stuck
at
nothing
and
appeared
to
derive
positive
pleasure
from
the
mere
act
of
putting
his
life
in
danger
no
human
foot
could
by
climbing
have
reached
the
spot
where
the
nest
of
the
daw
or
cornish
chough
was
fixed
for
the
precipice
besides
being
perpendicular
and
nearly
flat
projected
a
little
near
the
top
where
the
nest
lay
in
a
crevice
overhanging
the
surf
that
boiled
and
raged
in
zawn
buzzangein
indeed
the
nest
was
not
visible
from
the
spot
where
the
two
men
stood
and
it
could
only
be
seen
by
going
round
to
the
cliffs
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
gorge
without
a
moment
hesitation
maggot
swung
himself
over
the
edge
of
the
precipice
merely
cautioning
his
comrade
as
he
did
so
to
hold
on
to
the
rope
and
prevent
it
from
slipping
he
slid
down
about
two
yards
and
then
found
that
the
rock
overhung
so
much
that
he
was
at
least
six
feet
off
from
the
crevice
in
which
the
young
daws
nestled
comfortably
together
and
no
stretch
that
he
could
make
with
his
legs
long
though
they
were
was
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
get
on
the
narrow
ledge
just
below
the
nest
several
times
he
tried
to
gain
a
footing
and
at
each
effort
the
juvenile
daws
as
yet
ignorant
of
the
desperate
nature
of
man
opened
their
little
eyes
to
the
utmost
in
undisguised
amazement
for
full
five
minutes
maggot
wriggled
and
the
daws
gazed
and
the
anxious
comrade
above
watched
the
vibrations
and
jerks
of
the
part
of
the
rope
that
was
visible
to
him
while
he
listened
intently
the
bubbles
on
zawn
buzzangein
like
millions
of
watery
eyes
danced
and
twinkled
sixty
feet
below
as
if
in
wonder
at
the
object
which
swung
wildly
to
and
fro
in
at
last
maggot
managed
to
touch
the
rock
with
the
extreme
point
of
his
toe
a
slight
push
gave
him
swing
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
give
one
or
two
vigorous
shoves
by
which
means
he
swung
close
to
the
side
of
the
cliff
watching
his
opportunity
he
planted
both
feet
on
the
narrow
ledge
before
referred
to
stretched
out
his
hands
pressed
himself
flat
against
the
rock
let
go
the
rope
and
remained
fast
like
a
fly
sticking
to
a
wall
this
state
of
comparative
safety
he
announced
to
his
anxious
friend
above
by
exclaiming
all
right
got
the
daws
this
statement
was
however
not
literally
true
for
it
cost
him
several
minutes
of
slow
and
careful
struggling
to
enable
him
so
to
fix
his
person
as
to
admit
of
his
hands
being
used
for
stroobing
purposes
at
length
he
gained
the
object
of
his
ambition
and
transferred
the
horrified
daws
from
their
native
home
to
his
own
warm
but
unnatural
bosom
in
which
he
buttoned
them
up
tight
a
qualm
now
shot
through
maggot
heart
for
he
discovered
that
in
his
anxiety
to
secure
the
daws
he
had
let
go
the
rope
which
hung
at
a
distance
of
full
six
feet
from
him
and
of
course
far
beyond
his
reach
hullo
john
he
cried
hullo
shouted
john
in
reply
i
got
the
said
maggot
but
i
lost
the
aw
my
dear
gasped
john
have
lost
th
rope
it
need
scarcely
be
said
that
poor
john
cock
was
dreadfully
alarmed
at
this
and
that
he
eagerly
tendered
much
useless
advice
stretching
his
neck
the
while
as
far
as
was
safe
over
the
cliff
i
say
john
shouted
maggot
again
hullo
answered
john
i
tell
what
i
goin
to
jump
for
th
rope
if
i
do
miss
rope
run
thee
round
to
porth
ledden
cove
an
tak
my
shoes
weth
i
be
theere
before
having
made
this
somewhat
bold
prediction
maggot
collected
all
his
energies
and
sprang
from
his
narrow
perch
into
the
air
with
arms
and
hands
wildly
extended
his
effort
was
well
and
bravely
made
but
his
position
had
been
too
constrained
and
his
foothold
too
insecure
to
admit
of
a
good
jump
he
missed
the
rope
and
with
a
loud
cry
shot
like
an
arrow
into
the
boiling
flood
below
john
cock
heard
the
cry
and
the
plunge
and
stood
for
nearly
a
minute
gazing
in
horror
into
zawn
buzzangein
presently
he
drew
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
for
maggot
made
his
appearance
manfully
buffeting
the
waves
john
watched
him
with
anxiety
while
he
swam
out
towards
the
sea
escaped
the
perpendicular
sides
of
the
zawn
towards
which
the
breakers
more
than
once
swept
him
doubled
the
point
and
turned
in
towards
the
cove
the
opposite
cliffs
of
the
gorge
now
shut
the
swimmer
out
from
view
so
he
drew
another
deep
sigh
and
picking
up
his
comrade
shoes
ran
round
with
all
his
might
to
porth
ledden
cove
where
true
to
his
word
having
been
helped
both
by
wind
and
tide
maggot
had
arrived
before
him
are
safe
my
dear
man
was
john
first
question
iss
replied
maggot
shaking
himself
safe
enough
an
the
daws
too
but
semmen
to
me
they
gone
dead
this
was
too
true
the
poor
birds
had
perished
in
their
captor
bosom
chapter
fourteen
continues
to
treat
of
spirits
and
shows
the
value
of
hospitality
having
accomplished
the
feat
narrated
in
the
last
chapter
maggot
proceeded
with
his
friend
towards
the
town
on
their
way
they
had
to
pass
the
mouth
of
an
old
shaft
in
which
both
of
them
chanced
to
be
much
interested
at
that
time
inasmuch
as
it
contained
the
produce
of
a
recent
smuggling
expedition
on
a
large
scale
consisting
of
nearly
a
hundred
tubs
of
brandy
the
liquor
had
been
successfully
brought
ashore
and
concealed
in
the
mine
and
that
night
had
been
fixed
on
for
its
removal
mules
had
been
provided
and
about
fifty
men
were
appointed
to
meet
at
a
certain
spot
at
a
fixed
hour
to
carry
the
whole
away
into
the
neighbouring
towns
maggot
and
his
comrade
began
to
converse
about
the
subject
that
was
uppermost
in
their
minds
and
the
former
increased
his
pace
when
john
cock
drew
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
sun
was
getting
low
the
boys
will
be
mustering
now
said
john
an
them
theere
daws
have
kep
us
late
enough
already

do
say
that
the
boatsmen
are
informed
about
the
toobs
observed
maggot
more
need
to
look
alive
said
john
hallo
exclaimed
maggot
suddenly
there
some
wan
in
the
shaft
he
pointed
to
a
neighbouring
mound
of
rubbish
on
which
just
as
he
spoke
a
man
made
his
appearance
without
uttering
a
word
the
smugglers
sauntered
towards
the
mound
assuming
a
careless
air
as
though
they
were
passing
that
way
by
chance
on
drawing
near
they
recognised
ebenezer
trezise
the
sur
said
maggot
semmen
as

afterwards
maggot
nodded
as
he
spoke
and
left
the
place
at
a
slow
saunter
with
his
comrade
followed
by
the
thanks
and
of
the
boatsman
who
immediately
returned
to
the
laborious
task
of
clearing
out
the
old
shaft
they
got
the
scent

maggot
when

the
moment

was
out

of
the
boatsmen
and
maggot
walked
smartly
to
his
cottage

said

maggot
with
a
laugh
boatsmen
no

so

zackey
put
down
the
unfortunate
black
kitten
which
immediately
sought
comfort
in
repose
and
obeyed
his
father
summons
while
his
mother
knowing
that
her
husband
had
some
plot
in
his
wise
head
set
about
preparing
a
sumptuous
meal
which
consisted
of
bread
and
butter
tea
and
fried
mackerel
and
cornish
pasty
zackey

replied
zackey
with
a
wink
of
such
profound
meaning
that
his
sire
felt
quite
satisfied
he
was
equal
to
the
duty
assigned
him
now
doa
wag
tongue
more
than
enough
continued
maggot
and
go
play
with
the
chet
till
i
ready
the
urchin
at
once
descended
like
a
thunderbolt
on
the
black
kitten
but
that
marvellous
animal
had
succeeded
in
snatching
five
minutes
repose
which
seemed
to
be
amply
sufficient
to
recruit
its
energies
for
it
began
instantly
to
play
in
other
words
to
worry
and
scratch
the
hand
with
the
utmost
glee
and
in
a
few
minutes
maggot
and
his
son
went
out
and
hastened
to
the
old
shaft
where
they
found
the
boatsmen
still
hard
at
work
with
pick
and
shovel
clearing
away
the
rubbish
you
have
found
a
bunch
o
copper

i
dessay

replied
eben
trezise
with
a
knowing
smile
it
warm
work
observed
maggot
as
he
looked
down
the
hole
and
saw
that
what
the
boatsman
said
was
true
and
that
they
would
not
be
long
of
reaching
the
spot
where
the
liquor
had
been
concealed
trezise
admitted
that
it
warm
work
and
paused
to
wipe
his
heated
brow
i
wish
we
had
a
drop
o

he
said
looking
up

exclaimed

now
et

said
maggot
in
a
compassionate
tone
i
send
my
booy
hum
for
some
the
boatsmen
thanked
him
and
zackey
was
ordered
off
to
fetch
a
jug
of
water
but
his
father
voice
arrested
him
before
he
had
gone
a
hundred
yards
hold
on
a
bit
my
he
said
turning
to
trezise
come
up
hum
with
me
and
have
a
dish
o
tay
missus
have
got
it
all
ready
the
invitation
appeared
to
gratify
the
boatsmen
who
smiled
and
winked
at
each
other
as
though
they
thought
themselves
very
clever
fellows
to
have
discovered
the
whereabouts
of
a
hidden
treasure
and
to
be
refreshed
in
the
midst
of
their
toil
by
one
whom
they
knew
to
be
a
noted
smuggler
and
whom
they
strongly
suspected
of
being
concerned
in
the
job
they
were
at
that
time
endeavouring
to
frustrate
throwing
down
their
tools
they
laughingly
accepted
the
invitation
and
clambered
out
of
the
shaft
now
your
time
whispered
maggot
with
a
nod
to
his
hopeful
son
and
then
added
aloud
cut

a

as

an

he
do

replied
maggot
with
much
gravity
in
a
few
minutes
the
two
were
seated
at
mrs
board
enjoying
the
most
comfortable
meal
they
had
eaten
for
many
a
day
it
was
seasoned
too
with
such
racy
talk
abounding
in
anecdote
from
maggot
and
such
importunate
hospitality
on
the
part
of
his
better
half
that
the
men
felt
no
disposition
to
cut
it
short
little
grace
too
was
charmingly
attentive
for
she
poor
child
being
utterly
ignorant
of
the
double
parts
which
her
parents
were
playing
rejoiced
in
the
native
kindliness
of
her
heart
to
see
them
all
so
happy
even
the
chet
seemed
to
enter
into
the
spirit
of
what
was
going
on
for
regardless
of
the
splendid
opportunity
that
now
presented
itself
of
obtaining
repose
to
its
heart
content
that
black
ball
of
concentrated
essence
of
mischief
dashed
wildly
about
the
floor
and
up
the
with
its
back
up
and
its
tail
thickened
and
its
green
eyes
glaring
defiance
at
everything
animate
inanimate
or
otherwise
insomuch
that
maggot
made
sundry
efforts
to
quell
it
with
the
stool
and
mrs
maggot
followed
suit
with
a
but
in
vain
meanwhile
men
and
mules
and
horses
were
converging
by
many
paths
and
lanes
towards
the
old
shaft
and
the
shaft
itself
was
apparently
endued
with
the
properties
of
a
volcano
for
out

a
continuous
shower
of

and

many
stalwart

chapter
fifteen
introduces
a
stranger
describes
a
picnic
and
reveals
some
secrets
of
mining
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
that
magnificent
piece
of
coast
scenery
in
west
cornwall
known
by
the
name
of
gurnard
head
there
sauntered
one
fine
afternoon
a
gentleman
of
tall
commanding
aspect
all
the
parts
of
this
gentleman
were
if
we
may
so
speak
everything
about
him
savoured
of
the
superlative
degree
his
head
and
face
were
handsome
and
large
but
their
size
was
not
apparent
because
of
the
capacity
of
his
broad
shoulders
and
wide
chest
his
waist
was
slender
hair
curly
and
very
black
only
to
be
excelled
by
the
intense
blackness
of
his
eyes
his
nose
was
prominent
mouth
large
and
well
shaped
forehead
high
and
broad
whiskers
enormous
and
nostrils
so
large
as
to
appear
dilated
he
was
a
bony
man
a
powerful
man
also
tall
and
straight
and
a
little
beyond
forty
he
was
to
all
appearance
a
hero
of
romance
and
his
mind
seemed
to
be
filled
with
romantic
thoughts
for
he
smiled
frequently
as
he
gazed
around
him
from
the
top
of
the
cliffs
on
the
beautiful
landscape
which
lay
spread
out
at
his
feet
above
him
there
were
wild
undulating
slopes
covered
with
rich
green
gorse
below
were
the
cliffs
of
gurnard
cove
with
rocky
projections
that
resemble
the
castellated
work
of
man
hand
and
intermingled
therewith
much
of
the
connected
with
the
pilchard
fishery
with
masses
of
masonry
so
heavy
and
picturesque
as
to
resemble
handiwork
beyond
lay
the
blue
waters
of
the
atlantic
which
at
that
time
were
calm
almost
as
a
studded
with
a
hundred
sails
and
glittering
in
sunshine
the
spot
appeared
a
beautiful
solitude
for
no
living
thing
was
visible
save
the
romantic
gentleman
and
a
few
seagulls
and
sheep
the
pilchard
fishery
had
not
yet
commenced
and
the
three
or
four
fishermen
who
pitched
and
repaired
their
boats
on
the
one
little
spot
of
sand
that
could
be
seen
far
below
on
that
rugged
coast
appeared
like
mice
and
were
too
far
distant
to
break
the
feeling
of
solitude
a
feeling
which
was
not
a
little
enhanced
by
the
appearance
on
a
spot
not
far
distant
of
the
ruined
of
a
deserted
mine
it
was
indeed
a
lovely
afternoon
and
a
beautiful
scene
a
very
misanthrope
would
have
gazed
on
it
with
an
approach
at
least
to
benignity
no
wonder
that
george
augustus
clearemout
smiled
on
it
so
joyously
and
whisked
his
vigorously
in
the
exuberance
of
his
delight
but
strange
to
say
his
smile
was
always
brightest
and
the
cane
flourished
most
energetically
when
he
turned
his
eyes
on
the
ruined
mine
he
even
laughed
once
or
twice
and
muttered
to
himself
as
he
looked
at
the
picturesque
object
yet
there
seemed
nothing
in
its
appearance
calculated
to
produce
laughter
on
the
contrary
there
were
those
alive
whom
the
sight
of
it
might
have
reduced
to
tears
for
in
its
brief
existence
it
had
raised
uncommonly
little
tin
or
copper
although
it
had
succeeded
in
sinking
an
immense
amount
of
gold
nevertheless
mr
clearemout
chuckled
every
time
he
looked
at
the
ruin
and
appeared
very
much
tickled
with
the
thoughts
to
which
it
gave
rise
yes
the
very
thing
capital
he
muttered
to
himself
turning
again
and
again
to
the
object
of
his
admiration
could
be
better
ha
ha
most
suitable
yes
it
will
do
for
probably
it
will
do
he
repeated
the
phrase
two
or
three
times
with
a
greater
display
of
white
teeth
at
each
utterance
of
it
a
most
superb
name
wheal
ha
ha
spell
it
with
two
o
to
make
it
look
more
natural
and
ensure
correct
pronunciation
wheal
dooem
nothing
could
be
finer
quite
candid
and
no
one
can
call
it
a
swindle
this
last
idea
caused
mr
clearemout
to
break
into
the
loudest
laugh
in
which
he
had
hitherto
indulged
and
he
was
about
to
repeat
it
when
the
appearance
of
a
phaeton
at
a
turn
of
the
carriage
road
reduced
him
to
gravity
the
vehicle
contained
a
party
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
from
just
among
whom
were
rose
ellis
mrs
donnithorne
and
her
husband
oliver
trembath
and
mr
william
grenfell
a
gentleman
of
property
in
the
neighbourhood
as
it
approached
the
spot
where
mr
clearemout
stood
the
horse
swerved
at
a
sheep
which
started
out
from
behind
a
furze
bush
and
then
backed
so
rapidly
that
the
were
on
the
point
of
passing
over
the
edge
of
the
road
when
the
tall
stranger
sprang
to
its
head
and
led
it
gently
forward
the
danger
was
not
great
for
the
road
at
the
place
was
elevated
little
above
the
sward
but
it
was
sufficiently
so
to
warrant
a
profusion
of
thanks
from
the
occupants
of
the
vehicle
and
a
pressing
invitation
to
mr
clearemout
to
join
the
picnic
party
then
and
there
assembling
you
see
we
not
all
here
said
mr
donnithorne
bustling
about
energetically
as
he
pulled
baskets
and
bottles
from
the
body
of
the
vehicle
while
oliver
assisted
the
ladies
to
alight
there
another
machineful
coming
but
we
have
lots
of
grub
for
all
and
will
only
be
too
glad
of
your
company
mr
mr
what
did
you
say
clearemout
interposed
that
gentleman
with
a
bow
and
a
bland
smile
that
quite
took
mr
donnithorne
by
storm
ah
yes
glad
to
have
you
mr
clearemout
why
our
necks
might
all
have
been
broken
but
for
you
rose
my
dear
do
look
after
this
basket
there
thanks
how
hot
it
is
to
be
sure
mr
clearemout
mr
grenfell
no
introduction
only
to
let
you
know
his
name
my
wife
niece
rose
oliver
trembath
and
all
the
rest
there
dispense
with
ceremony
on
a
picnic
always
that
the
chief
fun
of
it
while
the
lively
old
gentleman
ran
on
thus
and
collected
the
baskets
together
mr
grenfell
who
was
a
tall
gentlemanly
man
of
about
sixty
with
a
grave
aristocratic
countenance
and
polite
manner
assured
mr
clearemout
that
he
was
happy
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
a
man
who
had
rendered
them
such
opportune
service
whereupon
mr
clearemout
declared
himself
to
be
fortunate
in
being
present
at
such
a
juncture
and
protested
that
his
service
was
a
trifle
in
itself
although
it
had
led
to
an
introduction
which
was
most
gratifying
then
turning
with
much
urbanity
of
manner
to
the
ladies
he
entered
into
conversation
with
them
here
they
come
shouted
old
mr
donnithorne
as
another
carriage
drove
up
the
rest
of
our
party
said
mr
grenfell
turning
to
mr
clearemout
friends
from
st
just
the
carriage
stopped
as
he
spoke
and
a
number
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
descended
therefrom
and
mingled
their
congratulations
at
the
narrow
escape
which
had
just
been
made
with
thanks
to
the
dark
stranger
and
with
orders
questions
and
explanations
innumerable
about
baskets
to
be
carried
and
places
to
be
selected
the
picnic
we
need
scarcely
say
very
much
resembled
picnics
in
general
all
were
in
good
spirits
elated
with
the
splendour
of
the
day
the
beauty
of
the
views
and
the
freshness
of
the
that
sprang
up
soon
after
their
arrival
the
only
one
whose
feelings
were
not
absolutely
unruffled
was
oliver
trembath
that
youth
was
afflicted
with
an
unaccountable
dislike
to
the
dark
stranger
which
rendered
him
somewhat
uncomfortable
as
for
the
stranger
he
made
himself
extremely
agreeable
told
anecdotes
sang
songs
and
became
an
immaculate
waiter
on
the
whole
company
handing
about
plates
glasses
knives
etcetera
etcetera
as
deftly
as
if
he
were
dealing
a
pack
of
cards
above
all
he
was
a
good
listener
and
not
only
heard
other
people
stories
out
to
the
end
but
commented
on
them
as
one
who
had
been
interested
with
all
this
he
was
particularly
attentive
to
rose
ellis
but
so
guarded
was
he
that
no
one
noticed
the
attentions
as
being
peculiar
except
rose
herself
and
oliver
trembath
who
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
to
his
great
surprise
and
displeasure
felt
the
demon
of
jealousy
tormenting
his
breast
but
in
the
midst
of
all
this
mr
george
augustus
clearemout
displayed
an
insatiable
curiosity
in
regard
to
mines
and
miners
whatever
might
be
the
subject
of
conversation
for
the
time
he
invariably
took
the
first
opportunity
of
returning
to
his
favourite
theme
with
one
or
another
of
the
party
as
occasion
served
ashamed
of
the
feelings
which
troubled
him
oliver
trembath
resolved
to
take
the
bold
and
manly
step
of
stifling
them
by
making
himself
agreeable
to
the
object
of
his
dislike
accordingly
he
availed
himself
of
an
opportunity
when
the
party
broke
up
into
groups
to
saunter
about
the
cliffs
and
entered
into
converse
with
the
stranger
on
the
subject
of
mines
you
appear
to
take
much
interest
in
mining
i
think
said
he
as
they
walked
out
on
the
promontory
together
i
do
indeed
replied
clearemout
the
mines
of
cornwall
have
ever
been
a
subject
of
deep
interest
to
me
and
the
miners
i
regard
as
a
race
of
men
singularly
endowed
with
courage
and
perseverance
your
opinion
of
them
is
correct
said
oliver
have
you
ever
seen
them
at
work
no
i
have
only
just
arrived
in
the
county
but
i
hope
to
visit
the
mines
ere
long
when
you
do
said
oliver
with
enthusiasm
your
opinion
of
them
will
be
strengthened
for
their
endurance
underground
and
their
perseverance
in
a
species
of
labour
which
taxes
their
muscular
power
as
well
as
their
patience
to
the
uttermost
surpasses
anything
i
have
either
seen
or
heard
of
england
does
not
fully
appreciate
because
she
is
not
minutely
acquainted
with
the
endurance
and
courage
of
her
cornish
miners
the
rocks
through
which
they
have
to
cut
are
so
hard
and
unyielding
that
men
who
had
not
been
trained
from
childhood
to
subdue
them
would
lose
heart
altogether
at
the
weight
of
toil
and
the
small
return
for
it
sometimes
indeed
miners
are
fortunate
and
here
as
elsewhere
lucky
hits
are
made
but
for
the
most
part
their
gains
are
barely
sufficient
for
their
wants
and
whether
they
are
lucky
or
unlucky
in
that
respect
the
toil
is
always
hard
so
hard
that
few
of
them
retain
health
or
strength
sufficient
to
go
underground
beyond
the
age
of
while
hundreds
of
them
find
an
early
grave
owing
to
disease
resulting
from
their
peculiar
work
or
to
accidents
these
last
are
usually
occasioned
by
the
bursting
out
of
collections
of
water
which
flood
the
mines
or
the
fall
of
masses
of
timber
or
the
premature
explosion
of
at
other
times
the
men
lose
hold
of
the
ladders
away
from
them
as
they
express
it
or
stumble
into
a
winze
which
is
a
small
shaft
connecting
level
with
level
in
which
latter
case
death
is
almost
certain
to
ensue
many
of
the
winzes
being
sixty
feet
deep
in
just
you
will
see
many
poor
fellows
who
have
been
blinded
or
maimed
in
the
mines
nevertheless
cornish
miners
are
a
contented
uncomplaining
race
of
men
and
cornwall
is
justly
proud
of
them
i
am
much
interested
in
what
you
tell
me
said
clearemout
in
fact
i
have
come
here
for
the
purpose
of
making
inquiry
into
mines
and
mining
concerns
then
you
will
find
this
to
be
the
very
place
for
you
said
oliver
my
uncle
mr
donnithorne
and
mr
grenfell
and
mr
cornish
are
intimately
acquainted
with
mining
in
all
its
phases
and
will
i
am
certain
be
happy
to
give
you
all
the
information
in
their
power
as
to
the
people
of
just
and
its
neighbourhood
you
will
find
them
most
agreeable
and
hospitable
i
can
speak
from
personal
experience
although
i
have
only
been
a
short
time
among
them
i
doubt
it
not
replied
mr
clearemout
with
a
bland
smile
my
own
limited
experience
goes
far
to
corroborate
what
you
say
and
i
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
of
still
further
testing
the
truth
of
your
observations
and
mr
george
augustus
clearemout
did
test
their
truth
for
several
weeks
after
the
picnic
he
was
received
with
kindness
and
hospitality
everywhere
he
was
taken
down
into
the
mines
by
obliging
agents
and
was
invited
to
several
of
the
periodical
business
dinners
called
at
which
he
met
shareholders
in
the
mines
and
had
an
opportunity
of
conversing
with
men
of
note
and
wealth
from
various
parts
of
the
county
he
dwelt
during
his
stay
with
old
mr
donnithorne
and
much
to
the
surprise
if
not
pleasure
of
rose
proved
himself
to
be
a
proficient
on
the
guitar
and
a
good
musician
at
length
the
dark
gentleman
took
his
departure
for
london
whither
we
shall
follow
him
and
watch
his
proceedings
for
a
very
short
time
before
returning
to
the
principal
scene
of
our
tale
almost
immediately
on
his
arrival
in
the
great
city
he
betook
himself
to
the
west
end
and
there
in
a
fashionable
square
solicited
an
interview
with
an
old
lady
whose
principal
noteworthy
points
were
that
she
had
much
gold
and
not
much
brains
she
was
a
confiding
old
lady
and
had
on
a
previous
occasion
been
quite
won
by
the
insinuating
address
of
the
charming
mr
clearemout
who
had
been
introduced
to
her
by
a
noble
lord
to
this
confiding
old
lady
george
augustus
painted
cornish
mines
and
mining
in
the
most
glowing
colours
and
recommended
her
to
invest
in
a
mine
a
portion
of
her
surplus
funds
the
confiding
old
lady
had
no
taste
for
speculation
and
was
rather
partial
to
the
three
per
cent
consols
but
george
augustus
was
so
charmingly
persuasive
that
she
could
not
help
giving
in
so
george
proposed
little
plans
and
opened
up
little
prospects
and
the
confiding
old
lady
agreed
to
all
the
little
plans
without
paying
much
regard
to
the
little
prospects
after
this
mr
clearemout
paid
another
visit
in
another
west
end
square
this
time
to
a
gentleman
the
gentleman
was
young
and
noble
for
clearemout
styled
him
my
lord
strange
to
say
he
also
was
of
a
confiding
nature
very
much
so
indeed
and
appeared
to
be
even
more
completely
under
the
influence
of
george
augustus
than
the
confiding
old
lady
herself
for
the
benefit
of
this
young
gentleman
mr
clearemout
painted
the
same
picture
in
the
same
glowing
colours
which
colours
seemed
to
grow
warmer
as
the
sun
of
success
rose
upon
it
he
added
something
about
the
value
of
a
name
and
referred
to
money
as
being
a
matter
of
small
consequence
in
comparison
the
young
lord
like
the
old
lady
agreed
to
everything
that
was
proposed
to
him
except
the
proposal
to
advance
money
on
that
point
he
was
resolute
but
clearemout
did
not
care
much
about
obtaining
money
from
the
confiding
young
gentleman
his
name
was
as
good
as
gold
and
would
enable
him
to
screw
money
out
of
others
after
this
the
dark
man
paid
a
visit
to
several
other
friends
at
the
west
end
all
of
whom
were
more
or
less
confiding
some
with
selfish
others
with
unselfish
dispositions
but
all
without
exception
a
little
weak
intellectually
these
had
the
same
glowing
pictures
of
a
cornish
mine
laid
before
them
and
most
of
them
swallowed
the
bait
whole
only
one
or
two
being
content
to
nibble
when
afternoon
began
to
merge
into
evening
mr
clearemout
paid
a
last
visit
for
the
day
but
not
in
the
west
end
rather
nearer
to
the
city
to
a
gentleman
somewhat
like
himself
though
less
prepossessing
for
whose
benefit
he
painted
no
glowing
picture
of
a
mine
but
to
whom
he
said
come
jack
i
made
a
pretty
good
job
of
it
let
go
and
have
a
chop
if
your
luck
has
equalled
mine
the
thing
is
done
and
wheal
dooem
as
i
have
named
the
sweet
little
thing
will
be
going
full
swing
in
a
couple
of
weeks
costing
perhaps
a
few
hundreds
to
put
it
in
working
order
with
a
trifle
thereafter
in
the
shape
of
wages
to
a
man
and
a
boy
to
coal
the
fire
and
keep
the
thing
moving
with
as
much
noise
as
possible
to
make
a
show
and
leaving
a
pretty
little
balance
of
some
twenty
or
thirty
thousand
at
the
credit
of
the
company
for
you
and
me
to
enjoy
in
the
meantime
a
small
sum
for
rent
of
office
clerk
salary
gas
and
coal
etcetera
as
long
as
the
bubble
lasts
thus
did
this
polite
scoundrel
go
about
from
house
to
house
getting
up
a
cornish
mining
company
on
false
pretences
as
other
polite
scoundrels
have
done
before
and
doubtless
as
others
will
do
again
bringing
into
unmerited
disrepute
those
genuine
and
grand
old
mines
of
cornwall
which
have
yielded
stores
of
tin
and
copper
to
the
enriching
of
the
english
nation
ever
since
those
days
when
the
phoenicians
sailed
their
adventurous
barks
to
the
cassiterides
in
quest
of
tin
while
these
things
were
being
done
in
london
a
terrible
catastrophe
happened
in
botallack
mine
which
threw
a
dark
cloud
for
some
time
over
more
than
one
lowly
cottage
in
just
chapter
sixteen
describes
holing
to
a
house
of
water
and
its
terrible
consequences
one
morning
about
seven
george
and
james
the
two
sons
of
poor
john
batten
of
botallack
started
for
their
work
as
usual
they
were
in
high
spirits
having
obtained
a
good
pitch
on
last
and
things
were
looking
well
they
put
on
their
underground
clothing
at
the
and
with
several
spare
candles
attached
to
buttons
on
the
breasts
of
their
coats
and
their
tools
slung
over
their
shoulders
walked
towards
the
head
of
the
at
the
mouth
of
the
shaft
they
paused
for
a
moment
and
glanced
round
the
sky
was
bright
the
landscape
green
and
the
sun
lit
up
many
a
distant
sail
on
the
atlantic
i
do
wish
said
the
younger
with
a
slight
sigh
that
our
work
was
more
in
the
sunshine
you
never
be
a
true
miner
jimmy
if
go
hankerin
after
the
sun
like
that
said
his
brother
with
a
laugh
as
he
stepped
on
the
ladder
and
began
to
descend
jimmy
took
a
last
look
at
the
rising
sun
and
followed
him
close
without
replying
the
lads
were
soon
beyond
the
reach
of
daylight
this
was
the
last
they
ever
saw
of
earthly
sunshine
in
a
few
minutes
there
came
a
low
soft
sound
up
the
shaft
it
was
the
lads
singing
one
of
wesley
beautiful
hymns
they
had
been
taught
to
sing
these
by
their
mother
from
their
infancy
and
usually
beguiled
the
tedium
of
the
long
descent
of
the
ladders
by
singing
one
or
two
of
them
arrived
at
their
place
of
work
the
brothers
threw
down
their
tools
fixed
their
candles
against
the
walls
of
the
level
and
began
the
labour
of
the
day
other
men
were
in
that
part
of
the
mine
at
the
time
and
the
brothers
found
that
a
message
had
been
sent
to
one
of
the
captains
requesting
him
to
come
and
examine
the
place
as
the
men
were
becoming
uneasy
at
the
increasing
flow
of
water
from
the
walls
one
miner
named
john
nicols
was
driving
an
end
that
is
extending
the
level
lengthwise
and
two
others
were
stopeing
or
cutting
up
into
the
roof
in
pursuit
of
a
promising
little
lode
they
were
using
hammer
and
pick
in
soft
ground
when
the
water
trickled
through
to
them
it
was
well
known
that
they
were
approaching
an
old
part
of
the
mine
which
had
not
been
worked
for
thirty
years
the
drainage
of
the
ground
was
not
however
accurately
known
therefore
questions
had
been
put
to
experienced
miners
as
to
the
probable
condition
of
this
untapped
land
the
answer
was
that
as
far
as
was
known
the
old
mine
was
full
of
deads
that
is
of
rubbish
and
that
there
was
therefore
in
all
probability
no
gathering
of
water
in
it
just
at
that
moment
one
of
the
captains
entered
the
level
accompanied
by
oliver
trembath
the
latter
had
been
called
to
see
a
patient
near
the
mine
and
chanced
to
be
with
the
captain
when
he
was
summoned
being
anxious
to
see
the
place
and
the
nature
of
the
danger
that
threatened
he
had
descended
along
with
him
before
the
captain
had
time
to
put
a
question
and
while
the
men
were
still
picking
cautiously
at
the
soft
ground
the
flow
of
water
suddenly
increased
recognising
probable
danger
a
lad
named
oats
called
to
his
father
who
was
at
the
end
of
the
level
with
nicols
at
the
same
moment
the
water
forced
a
gap
in
the
wall
three
feet
long
by
about
half
a
foot
wide
and
burst
in
upon
them
with
terrific
violence
all
turned
and
fled
oats
and
his
son
with
the
captain
and
nicols
made
for
the
nearest
shaft
which
was
about
eighty
yards
distant
and
escaped
but
the
brothers
batten
and
oliver
were
thrown
down
and
swept
away
one
desperate
effort
was
made
by
oliver
to
outstrip
the
rushing
stream
but
the
candles
had
been
blown
out
and
not
stooping
sufficiently
low
he
dashed
his
head
against
an
overhanging
rock
and
fell
he
retained
sufficient
consciousness
however
to
be
aware
that
a
desperate
struggle
for
life
must
be
made
and
without
knowing
what
he
did
or
at
what
he
aimed
he
fought
with
the
strength
of
a
giant
in
thick
darkness
against
the
chaotic
flood
but
his
strength
soon
gave
way
and
in
a
few
seconds
he
became
insensible
that
a
terrible
catastrophe
had
occurred
was
at
once
known
to
all
the
men
in
the
mine
by
the
roar
of
the
rushing
water
in
order
that
the
reader
may
clearly
understand
the
situation
it
is
necessary
to
explain
that
the
accident
occurred
in
one
of
the
levels
at
or
near
its
extremity
at
the
same
depth
there
were
many
of
these
underground
passages
running
in
various
directions
and
several
miles
in
extent
some
of
them
being
worked
but
most
of
them
old
and
used
up
all
the
ore
having
been
extracted
from
them
at
various
depths
below
this
level
other
levels
had
been
cut
also
running
in
various
directions
and
of
several
miles
extent
these
successive
levels
were
not
only
connected
and
communicated
with
by
the
main
shafts
of
the
mine
but
by
winzes
or
smaller
shafts
which
connected
level
with
level
in
many
places
some
of
these
were
used
as
but
others
had
been
cut
merely
for
the
purpose
of
securing
ventilation
in
many
parts
of
these
lower
levels
miners
were
at
work
some
in
following
the
course
of
promising
lodes
stopeing
or
cutting
overhead
some
cutting
downwards
some
driving
ends
or
extending
the
levels
and
others
sinking
winzes
to
keep
up
the
ventilation
as
they
pushed
further
and
further
from
the
shafts
or
throats
down
which
flowed
the
air
by
all
of
these
men
the
dreaded
sounds
above
which
reached
the
profounder
depths
with
the
muffled
but
roar
of
a
distant
storm
were
well
understood
and
well
heard
for
the
waters
in
their
irresistible
fury
carried
before
them
the
atmosphere
and
sent
it
through
the
low
and
narrow
levels
as
if
through
the
circling
tubes
of
a
monster
trumpet
which
mingled
with
the
crash
of
hurling
timbers
rocks
and
debris
created
a
mighty
roar
that
excelled
in
hideous
grandeur
the
prolonged
peals
of
loud
thunder
every
man
dropped
his
tools
and
ran
to
the
nearest
shaft
for
his
life
it
was
not
indeed
probable
that
the
flood
would
fill
all
the
ramifications
of
the
vast
mine
but
no
one
knew
for
certain
where
the
catastrophe
had
occurred
or
how
near
the
danger
might
be
to
the
spot
where
he
laboured
enough
for
each
that
death
was
dealing
terrible
destruction
somewhere
and
that
unless
every
muscle
were
strained
to
the
uttermost
the
pathway
might
be
filled
up
and
his
retreat
cut
off
the
rush
was
swiftly
but
not
easily
made
those
who
have
never
traversed
the
levels
of
a
cornish
mine
may
perhaps
fancy
on
hearing
of
levels
six
feet
high
and
about
two
and
a
half
feet
broad
on
the
average
that
the
flight
might
resemble
the
rush
of
men
through
the
windings
and
turnings
of
the
intricate
passages
in
a
stupendous
old
castle
but
it
was
far
otherwise
the
roofs
walls
and
floors
of
these
levels
were
irregular
not
only
in
direction
but
in
height
and
form
there
was
no
levelling
or
anywhere
it
was
tunnelling
of
the
roughest
kind
angles
and
projections
remained
as
the
chisel
the
pick
and
the
had
left
them
here
the
foot
tripped
over
a
lump
or
plunged
into
a
hollow
there
the
head
narrowly
missed
a
depending
mass
of
rock
or
the
shoulder
grazed
a
projecting
one
elsewhere
pools
of
water
lay
in
the
path
and
at
intervals
the
yawning
chasm
of
a
winze
appeared
with
one
or
two
broken
planks
to
bridge
the
gulf
of
twenty
forty
or
sixty
feet
that
descended
to
the
levels
below
sometimes
it
was
possible
to
run
with
the
head
stooped
a
little
generally
the
back
had
to
be
bent
low
often
double
and
occasionally
progress
could
only
be
made
on
hands
and
knees
this
too
with
a
candle
to
be
guarded
from
blasts
of
air
or
dripping
water
and
trimmed
lest
it
should
go
out
and
leave
the
place
in
total
darkness
but
habit
and
practice
had
made
the
men
so
familiar
with
the
place
and
so
nimble
in
their
movements
that
they
traversed
the
levels
with
wonderful
rapidity
and
most
of
them
ascended
the
shaft
of
the
mine
in
safety
some
however
escaped
with
the
utmost
difficulty
and
a
few
there
were
chiefly
among
those
who
had
been
near
to
or
immediately
below
the
scene
of
the
outbreak
who
perished
miserably
at
the
first
rush
the
water
had
almost
filled
the
level
where
it
occurred
and
sweeping
onward
about
eight
fathoms
to
a
winze
plunged
down
and
partly
over
it
the
greater
part
however
went
down
to
the
fathom
level
east
of
this
a
man
named
anguin
with
his
two
sons
william
and
james
youths
of
about
twenty
years
of
age
were
at
work
they
heard
the
roar
of
the
approaching
torrent
and
the
father
and
younger
son
james
rushed
towards
the
winze
intending
to
ascend
the
ladder
before
they
reached
it
the
flood
was
pouring
down
with
deafening
noise
the
least
harmful
part
of
the
cataract
was
the
water
for
the
current
now
carried
along
with
it
stones
pieces
of
timber
and
rubbish
to
encounter
all
this
might
have
caused
the
stoutest
hearts
to
quail
but
miners
can
never
calculate
the
probable
extent
of
an
inundation
they
might
indeed
by
remaining
in
the
roof
of
the
level
escape
but
on
the
other
hand
if
the
flood
should
be
great
enough
to
fill
the
place
they
would
certainly
be
drowned
father
and
son
therefore
preferred
to
make
a
desperate
effort
to
save
their
lives
they
dashed
into
the
flood
and
made
a
grasp
at
the
ladder
but
before
their
hands
touched
the
first
round
they
were
beaten
down
and
swept
away
dead
corpses
william
on
the
other
hand
climbed
to
a
of
timber
where
he
remained
until
the
water
abated
which
it
did
in
a
very
short
time
for
events
of
this
kind
are
for
the
most
part
awfully
sudden
and
brief
as
well
as
fatal
then
descending
he
groped
his
way
in
the
dark
over
the
very
spot
where
his
father
and
brother
lay
dead
fearfully
mutilated
and
covered
with
rubbish
and
escaped
up
the
shaft
in
a
still
lower
level
two
brothers
were
at
work
miners
usually
work
in
couples
sometimes
in
larger
numbers
and
brothers
frequently
go
together
they
were
in
a
winze
about
thirty
fathoms
from
the
being
overtaken
by
the
flood
they
were
washed
to
the
next
level
and
along
it
nearly
to
the
shaft
as
the
torrent
tore
past
this
place
bearing
splintered
timber
stones
and
rubbish
along
with
it
an
iron
wagon
was
caught
up
and
flung
across
the
level
this
formed
a
barricade
against
which
the
brothers
were
dashed
the
elder
of
these
brothers
was
afterwards
found
alive
here
and
carried
to
the
surface
but
he
was
speechless
and
died
twenty
minutes
after
being
brought
up
when
the
dead
body
of
the
younger
and
weaker
brother
was
recovered
it
was
found
to
be
dreadfully
shattered
nearly
every
bone
being
crushed
in
the
same
level
two
men
john
paul
and
andrew
teague
hearing
the
rush
of
the
advancing
torrent
above
their
head
made
for
a
shaft
went
up
it
against
a
heavy
fall
of
water
and
escaped
a
man
named
richard
a
powerful
man
and
a
cool
experienced
miner
who
had
faced
death
in
almost
every
form
was
at
work
in
one
of
the
lowest
levels
with
his
son
william
a
youth
of
and
his
nephew
a
lad
of
seventeen
who
was
the
sole
support
of
a
widowed
mother
with
six
children
they
were
thirty
fathoms
from
one
of
the
winzes
down
which
the
water
streamed
on
hearing
the
roar
richard
cautioned
the
younger
men
to
be
prompt
but
collected
no
time
was
to
be
lost
but
rash
haste
might
prove
as
fatal
as
delay
he
sent
them
on
in
front
of
him
and
they
rushed
under
and
past
the
winze
where
they
were
nearly
crushed
by
the
falling
water
and
where
of
course
their
candles
were
extinguished
leaving
them
in
midnight
darkness
this
last
was
not
so
serious
a
matter
to
the
elder
richard
as
at
first
sight
it
might
appear
he
knew
every
foot
of
the
ground
they
had
to
traverse
with
all
its
turnings
yawning
chasms
and
plank
bridges
and
could
have
led
the
way
blindfold
almost
as
easily
as
with
a
light
as
they
neared
the
shaft
he
passed
the
younger
men
and
led
the
way
to
prevent
them
falling
into
it
at
this
time
the
water
raged
round
them
as
high
as
their
waists
the
nephew
who
was
weak
in
consequence
of
a
fever
from
which
he
had
not
quite
recovered
fell
and
passing
the
others
unobserved
went
down
the
shaft
and
was
lost
the
escape
of
richard
and
his
son
was
most
wonderful
william
was
a
stout
fellow
but
the
father
much
more
so
they
were
driven
at
first
into
the
shaft
but
there
the
fall
of
water
was
so
great
that
they
could
do
nothing
more
than
cling
to
the
ladder
by
this
cataract
they
were
beaten
back
into
the
level
but
here
the
water
rose
around
them
so
quickly
and
with
such
force
as
to
oblige
them
to
make
another
effort
to
ascend
there
was
a
crevice
in
the
roof
of
the
level
here
in
which
the
father
had
left
part
of
his
supply
of
candles
and
a
he
succeeded
in
reaching
these
and
in
striking
a
light
which
revealed
to
them
the
full
horrors
of
their
situation
it
was
with
difficulty
that
the
candle
could
be
kept
burning
by
holding
it
close
to
the
roof
under
a
projecting
piece
of
rock
which
sheltered
it
partially
from
the
dashing
spray
let
us
try
again
shouted
the
father
the
noise
was
so
great
that
it
was
with
difficulty
they
could
make
each
other
hear
it
all
over
with
we
cried
the
son
let
us
pray
faither
the
father
urged
his
son
however
to
make
another
effort
as
the
water
had
risen
nearly
to
their
waists
and
prevailed
on
him
to
do
so
getting
on
the
ladder
himself
first
in
order
to
bear
the
brunt
of
the
falling
water
and
thus
break
its
force
to
his
son
as
the
water
below
was
now
rising
swiftly
william
only
held
the
light
long
enough
to
enable
his
father
to
obtain
a
secure
footing
on
the
ladder
when
he
dropped
it
and
followed
him
so
anxious
was
the
youth
to
escape
from
the
danger
that
menaced
him
from
below
that
he
pressed
eagerly
up
against
his
father
in
doing
so
he
the
rounds
of
the
ladder
on
which
his
father
trod
and
almost
at
every
step
the
latter
unwittingly
planted
his
boots
on
the
son
hands
lacerating
them
terribly
to
avoid
this
was
impossible
so
heavy
was
the
descending
flood
that
it
was
only
his
unusually
great
strength
which
enabled
the
father
to
advance
slowly
up
against
it
the
son
being
partially
sheltered
by
his
father
body
knew
not
the
power
against
which
he
had
to
contend
and
being
anxious
to
go
up
faster
pressed
too
closely
on
him
regardless
in
his
alarm
of
the
painful
consequences
masses
of
stone
wood
and
rubbish
dashed
down
the
shaft
and
grazed
their
shoulders
but
providentially
none
struck
them
severely
thus
slowly
and
painfully
did
they
ascend
to
a
height
of
feet
and
were
saved
in
another
part
of
the
mine
below
the
level
where
the
accident
occurred
james
penrose
whom
we
have
already
introduced
to
the
reader
was
at
work
with
john
cock
the
latter
having
taken
a
fancy
to
try
mining
for
a
time
instead
of
smuggling
just
by
way
of
a
change
had
joined
the
former
in
working
a
pitch
in
botallack
mine
these
men
were
peculiarly
situated
they
were
in
a
level
which
the
water
entered
not
by
flowing
along
or
descending
but
by
rising
up
through
a
winze
on
hearing
the
noise
they
ran
to
this
winze
and
looking
down
saw
the
water
boiling
and
roaring
far
below
they
were
about
to
pass
on
to
the
shaft
when
penrose
observed
a
dark
object
moving
on
the
ladder
it
came
slowly
up
hallo
john
cried
penrose
stay
a
bit
here
some
one
on
the
ladder
john
cock
returned
and
they
both
stooped
to
afford
help
in
another
moment
oliver
trembath
drenched
and
bleeding
and
covered
with
mud
stood
or
rather
reeled
before
them
it
was
evident
that
he
was
only
half
conscious
and
scarcely
able
to
stand
but
they
had
no
time
to
speak
scarcely
to
think
for
the
water
was
already
boiling
up
through
the
winze
like
a
huge
fountain
and
filling
the
level
they
seized
oliver
by
the
arms
and
dragged
him
hastily
towards
the
nearest
winze
that
led
upward
here
they
found
water
pouring
down
like
rain
and
heard
its
thunders
above
them
but
the
stream
was
not
sufficient
to
retard
their
progress
up
the
winze
which
they
ascended
with
comparative
ease
penrose
and
cock
were
surprised
at
this
but
the
small
quantity
of
water
was
soon
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
the
hatch
or
of
the
winze
had
been
closed
and
thus
while
it
prevented
the
great
body
of
water
above
from
descending
also
effectually
shut
off
the
only
way
of
escape
they
were
therefore
compelled
to
descend
again
to
the
level
in
which
the
water
was
now
rising
rapidly
oliver
leaned
against
the
rock
and
stood
in
apathetic
silence
penrose
tried
to
rouse
him
but
failed
his
injuries
had
rendered
him
almost
in
capable
of
coherent
speech
and
his
replies
showed
that
his
mind
was
rambling
on
the
necessity
of
making
haste
and
struggling
hard
james
penrose
who
was
a
and
a
local
preacher
among
the
wesleyans
and
mentally
much
superior
to
his
comrades
now
proved
beyond
a
doubt
that
his
god
was
to
him
a
very
present
help
in
trouble
both
he
and
cock
knew
or
at
least
believed
that
death
was
certain
to
overtake
them
in
a
few
minutes
for
both
before
and
behind
retreat
was
cut
off
and
the
water
was
increasing
with
frightful
rapidity
observing
that
cock
looked
anxious
penrose
turned
and
said
earnestly
john
you
and
i
shall
be
dead
in
a
few
minutes
for
myself
i
have
no
fear
for
my
peace
is
already
made
with
god
through
jesus
christ
blessed
be
his
name
but
oh
john
you
do
know
that
it
is
not
so
with
you
turn
john
turn
even
now
to
the
lord
who
tells
you
that
thy
sins
be
as
scarlet
they
shall
be
as
white
as
snow
and
that
is
the
day
of
salvation
if
you
will
only
repent
and
believe
on
him
pray
for
un
james
said
cock
whose
face
betrayed
his
fears
penrose
at
once
clasped
his
hands
and
closing
his
eyes
prayed
for
his
comrade
with
such
fervour
that
his
voice
rose
loud
and
strong
above
the
turmoil
of
the
flood
he
was
still
engaged
in
prayer
when
the
water
drove
them
from
the
level
and
compelled
them
to
the
winze
here
john
cock
began
to
pray
for
himself
in
agonising
tones
by
this
time
oliver
had
partially
recovered
and
suggested
that
they
should
ascend
the
winze
to
the
top
penrose
assured
him
that
it
was
useless
to
do
so
but
while
he
was
still
speaking
he
observed
that
the
water
ceased
to
rise
and
began
quickly
to
abate
in
fact
all
that
we
have
taken
so
long
to
describe
from
the
outburst
to
the
termination
of
the
great
rush
took
place
within
half
an
hour
the
noise
overhead
now
grew
less
and
less
until
it
almost
ceased
they
then
ascended
to
the
and
tried
to
force
it
open
but
failed
they
shouted
however
and
were
heard
ere
long
by
those
who
had
escaped
and
had
returned
to
the
mine
to
search
for
their
less
fortunate
companions
the
was
opened
strong
and
willing
hands
were
thrust
down
the
dark
winze
to
the
rescue
and
in
a
few
seconds
the
three
men
were
saved
the
danger
was
past
but
several
lives
had
been
lost
in
the
terrible
catastrophe
chapter
seventeen
touches
on
the
causes
of
accidents
oliver
in
a
new
light
and
his
uncle
in
a
sad
one
that
was
a
sad
day
in
just
which
followed
the
event
related
in
the
last
chapter
many
a
wail
was
heard
round
the
mouths
of
the
shafts
as
the
remains
of
those
who
perished
were
brought
to
the
surface
and
conveyed
to
their
former
homes
saddest
of
all
perhaps
was
the
procession
that
marched
slowly
to
the
cottage
of
blind
john
batten
and
laid
the
two
lads
before
their
stricken
parents
tears
were
wrung
from
the
strongest
men
there
when
they
beheld
the
agonised
but
tearless
mother
guide
her
hand
to
their
faces
that
he
might
for
the
last
time
feel
the
loved
ones
whom
she
said
in
the
bitterness
of
her
grief
he
should
never
see
more
never
see
more
dear
lass
he
replied
with
a
sad
smile
how
can
thee
say
so
shall
we
not
behold
their
dear
faces
again
when
we
see
our
blessed
lord
face
to
face
thus
the
christian
miner
comforted
himself
and
his
sorrowing
family
it
is
right
to
add
that
such
catastrophes
are
not
of
frequent
occurrence
in
the
mines
the
danger
of
holing
to
a
house
of
water
is
so
great
and
so
well
known
that
the
operation
is
usually
conducted
with
great
care
and
accident
is
well
guarded
against
nevertheless
an
occasional
act
of
carelessness
will
now
and
then
result
in
a
terrible
disaster
a
catastrophe
similar
in
all
its
chief
features
to
that
which
has
been
related
in
the
last
chapter
happened
in
north
levant
mine
many
years
ago
and
in
the
of
the
wesleyan
chapel
of
just
may
be
seen
a
tombstone
which
bears
record
of
the
sad
event
as
follows
to
the
memory
james
john
sons
of
james
and
nanny
thomas
of
bollowall
in
this
parish
who
were
drowned
with
three
others
by
the
holing
to
a
house
of
water
in
north
levant
mine
on
the
first
of
a
house
of
much
larger
dimensions
and
containing
a
much
greater
body
of
water
than
that
which
caused
the
latest
destruction
of
life
in
north
levant
mine
was
cleared
of
water
not
long
ago
in
botallack
the
agents
knew
of
its
existence
for
the
whole
region
both
above
and
below
ground
being
measured
off
and
planned
they
could
lay
their
finger
on
the
exact
spot
where
they
knew
that
an
old
mine
existed
they
kept
a
large
borer
six
feet
long
going
constantly
before
them
as
they
cut
their
way
towards
the
point
of
danger
the
result
was
that
when
the
borer
at
last
pierced
through
to
the
old
mine
there
were
six
feet
of
solid
rock
between
them
and
the
water
through
the
small
hole
the
water
flowed
and
thus
the
mine
was
slowly
but
safely
drained
in
the
other
case
the
ground
happened
to
be
soft
and
had
been
somewhat
recklessly
cut
away
of
course
there
are
occasions
proving
the
truth
of
the
proverb
that
accidents
will
happen
in
the
best
regulated
families
in
which
neither
foresight
nor
precaution
can
prevent
evil
but
these
are
comparatively
few
sometimes
the
cupidity
of
a
miner
will
lead
him
for
the
sake
of
following
a
rich
lode
to
approach
too
near
and
too
recklessly
to
danger
despite
the
vigilance
of
captains
and
cause
considerable
risk
to
the
mine
as
well
as
to
themselves
such
was
the
case
once
long
ago
at
botallack
when
the
miners
below
the
sea
cut
away
the
rock
to
within
three
or
four
feet
of
the
water
and
actually
made
a
small
hole
through
so
that
they
had
to
plug
it
up
with
a
piece
of
wood
this
is
a
fact
which
we
can
vouch
for
having
seen
the
plug
and
heard
the
boulders
rattling
loudly
over
our
head
with
each
successive
wave
but
there
is
no
danger
here
because
the
cutting
under
the
sea
is
narrow
and
the
rock
solid
and
intensely
hard
such
also
was
the
case
not
many
years
since
at
levant
mine
where
the
men
working
in
the
levels
under
the
sea
drove
upwards
until
the
salt
water
began
to
trickle
through
to
them
in
alarming
quantities
insomuch
that
the
other
miners
struck
work
and
refused
to
go
again
into
the
mine
unless
the
workings
in
that
part
were
stopped
and
the
place
made
secure
this
was
accordingly
done
and
the
men
returned
to
the
mine
the
danger
here
was
really
great
because
the
cutting
that
had
been
made
was
wide
and
the
ground
overhead
comparatively
soft
but
to
return
to
our
tale
for
many
days
after
the
catastrophe
oliver
trembath
lay
in
his
bed
suffering
from
severe
cuts
and
bruises
as
well
as
from
what
must
have
been
as
nearly
as
possible
concussion
of
the
brain
for
he
had
certainly
been
washed
down
one
of
the
winzes
although
he
himself
retained
only
a
confused
recollection
of
the
events
of
that
terrible
day
and
could
not
tell
what
had
befallen
him
at
length
however
he
became
convalescent
and
a
good
deal
of
his
old
vigour
returned
during
this
period
of
illness
and
convalescence
oliver
had
been
constrained
by
old
mr
donnithorne
to
take
up
his
abode
in
his
house
and
the
young
doctor
could
not
have
experienced
more
attention
and
kindness
from
the
old
couple
if
he
had
been
their
son
rose
ellis
too
did
her
best
to
cheer
him
and
as
we
need
scarcely
add
was
wonderfully
successful
in
her
efforts
it
was
during
this
period
that
oliver
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
young
man
of
just
named
charles
tregarthen
a
congenial
spirit
and
one
who
was
besides
a
thorough
gentleman
and
an
earnest
christian
with
this
youth
he
formed
a
sincere
friendship
and
although
the
subject
of
religion
was
never
obtrusively
thrust
upon
him
by
young
tregarthen
it
entered
so
obviously
into
all
his
thoughts
and
shone
so
clearly
in
his
words
and
conduct
that
oliver
heart
was
touched
and
he
received
impressions
at
that
time
which
never
left
him
oliver
and
his
friend
were
sitting
one
forenoon
in
mr
which
commanded
an
extensive
view
of
green
fields
and
stone
walls
with
the
beams
and
machinery
of
mines
on
the
horizon
and
the
blue
sea
beyond
they
were
planning
a
short
walking
tour
which
it
was
thought
would
be
of
great
benefit
to
oliver
in
that
stage
of
his
recovery
when
old
mr
donnithorne
entered
the
room
with
a
somewhat
perturbed
expression
of
countenance
how
are
you
charlie
my
boy
he
said
oliver
i
want
to
have
a
few
minutes
talk
with
you
in
my
room
on
business
i
know
charlie
will
excuse
you
i
was
on
the
point
of
taking
leave
at
any
rate
said
tregarthen
with
a
smile
as
he
grasped
oliver
hand
think
over
our
plan
like
a
good
fellow
i
am
sure
mr
donnithorne
will
approve
of
it
and
i
look
in
forenoon
to
hear
what
decision
you
come
to
oliver
said
mr
donnithorne
sitting
down
opposite
the
invalid
when
his
friend
had
left
and
frowning
portentously
know
i
a
ruined
man
i
trust
not
uncle
replied
oliver
with
an
incredulous
smile
supposing
that
the
old
gentleman
was
jesting
yes
but
i
am
he
repeated
with
tremendous
gravity
at
all
events
i
shall
be
ere
long
these
these
vile
jewels
will
be
the
death
of
me
having
thus
broken
the
ice
mr
donnithorne
went
on
with
much
volubility
of
utterance
and
exasperation
of
tone
to
explain
that
legal
proceedings
had
been
instituted
for
the
recovery
of
the
jewels
which
he
had
purchased
from
the
fishermen
that
things
seemed
almost
certain
to
go
against
him
and
that
in
all
probability
he
should
be
compelled
to
sell
his
estate
in
order
to
refund
the
money
but
can
you
not
sell
your
shares
in
botallack
and
refund
with
the
proceeds
said
oliver
no
i
can
not
replied
the
old
gentleman
you
know
that
at
present
these
shares
are
scarcely
saleable
except
at
a
ruinous
discount
and
it
would
be
a
pity
to
part
with
them
just
now
seeing
that
there
is
some
hope
of
improvement
at
this
time
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
sell
my
estate
and
i
do
think
there
will
be
enough
left
to
buy
butter
to
my
bread
after
this
unhappy
affair
is
settled
for
it
amounts
to
some
thousands
of
pounds
indeed
uncle
how
comes
it
that
they
found
out
the
value
of
them
oh
simply
enough
oliver
but
strangely
too
you
must
know
that
maggot
the
scoundrel
and
yet
not
such
a
scoundrel
either
for
the
fellow
informed
on
me
in
a
passion
without
having
any
idea
of
the
severity
of
the
consequences
that
would
follow
maggot
it
seems
kept
the
cloth
belt
in
which
the
jewels
were
found
tied
round
the
waist
and
there
happened
to
be
a
piece
of
parchment
sewed
up
in
the
folds
of
it
in
which
the
number
and
value
of
the
jewels
were
enumerated
this
belt
was
ferreted
out
by
the
lawyers
and
the
result
is
that
as
i
said
before
i
shall
be
a
ruined
man
verily
added
mr
donnithorne
with
a
look
of
vexation
as
he
stumped
up
and
down
the
room
with
his
hands
thrust
deep
into
his
breeches
pockets
verily
my
wife
was
a
true
prophetess
when
she
told
me
that
my
sin
would
be
sure
to
find
me
out
and
that
honesty
was
the
best
policy
my
conscience
half
inclined
to
haul
down
my
colours
and
let
her
manage
me
after
all
i
am
much
concerned
at
what
you
tell
me
said
oliver
and
i
regret
now
very
deeply
that
the
few
hundreds
which
i
possessed
when
i
came
here
and
which
you
know
are
all
my
fortune
have
also
been
invested
in
botallack
shares
for
they
should
have
been
heartily
at
your
service
uncle
do
trouble
yourself
about
your
hundreds
lad
said
the
old
gentleman
testily
i
did
come
here
to
ask
assistance
from
you
in
that
way
but
to
tell
you
the
facts
of
the
case
and
ask
you
to
do
me
the
favour
to
carry
a
letter
to
my
lawyer
in
penzance
and
inquire
into
the
condition
of
a
mine
i
have
something
to
do
with
there
a
somewhat
singular
mine
which
i
think
will
surprise
as
well
as
interest
you
will
you
do
this
for
me
lad
most
willingly
replied
oliver
you
heard
my
friend
charlie
tregarthen
speak
of
our
intention
to
go
on
a
walking
tour
for
a
couple
of
days
now
if
you
have
no
objection
he
and
i
will
set
off
together
without
delay
and
make
penzance
our
goal
going
round
by
the
land
end
and
the
coast
so
be
it
oliver
and
do
hurry
yourselves
for
the
business
will
wait
well
enough
for
a
day
or
two
but
take
care
of
yourself
lad
do
go
swimming
off
the
land
end
again
and
above
all
things
avoid
smugglers
the
scoundrels
they
have
been
the
ruin
of
me
oliver
not
bad
fellows
in
their
way
either
but
unprincipled
characters
desperately
regardless
of
the
national
laws
and
and
keep
clear
of
i
advise
you
strongly
have
nothing
to
do
with
oliver
my
son
so
saying
the
old
gentleman
left
the
room
shaking
his
head
with
profound
gravity
chapter
eighteen
tells
of
king
arthur
and
other
more
or
less
fabulous
matters
next
day
oliver
trembath
and
his
friend
charles
tregarthen
before
the
sun
had
mounted
his
own
height
above
the
horizon
were
on
their
way
to
the
land
end
the
young
men
were
admirably
suited
to
each
other
both
were
well
educated
and
possessed
similar
tastes
though
their
temperaments
were
dissimilar
and
both
were
strong
athletic
youths
oliver
superiority
in
this
latter
respect
being
at
that
time
counterbalanced
by
his
recent
illness
which
reduced
him
nearly
to
a
level
with
his
less
robust
companion
their
converse
was
general
and
desultory
until
they
reached
the
end
on
the
point
of
which
they
had
resolved
to
breakfast
now
oliver
we
have
purchased
an
appetite
said
tregarthen
throwing
down
a
wallet
in
which
he
carried
some
provisions
let
us
to
work
stay
charlie
not
here
said
oliver
let
us
get
out
on
the
point
where
we
shall
have
a
better
view
of
the
cliffs
on
either
side
of
the
land
end
i
love
a
wide
unobstructed
view
as
you
will
oliver
i
leave
you
to
select
our
table
but
i
pray
you
to
remember
that
however
steady
your
head
may
have
been
in
days
of
yore
when
you
scaled
the
scottish
mountains
the
rough
reception
it
has
met
with
in
our
cornish
mines
has
given
it
a
shake
that
renders
caution
necessary
pshaw
charlie
do
talk
to
me
of
caution
as
if
i
were
a
timid
old
woman
nay
then
i
talk
of
it
because
you
are
a
timid
old
woman
but
a
reckless
young
man
who
seems
bent
on
committing
suicide
yonder
is
a
grassy
spot
which
i
think
will
suit
you
well
he
pointed
to
a
level
patch
of
sward
on
the
neck
of
land
that
connects
the
outlying
and
rugged
promontory
which
forms
the
extreme
land
end
with
the
cliffs
of
the
mainland
here
they
spread
their
meal
and
from
this
point
they
could
see
the
cliffs
and
bays
of
the
shore
extending
on
the
one
hand
towards
cape
cornwall
and
on
the
other
towards
that
most
romantic
part
of
the
coast
known
by
the
somewhat
curious
name
of
tolpedenpenwith
where
rocks
and
caverns
are
found
in
such
fantastic
fashion
that
the
spot
has
become
justly
celebrated
for
picturesque
grandeur
at
their
feet
far
below
the
great
waves
caused
by
the
swell
for
there
was
no
wind
boomed
in
solemn
majesty
encircling
the
cliffs
with
a
of
foam
while
on
the
horizon
the
scilly
islands
could
be
seen
shimmering
faintly
a
bright
sun
shone
on
the
unruffled
sea
and
hundreds
of
ships
and
boats
lay
becalmed
on
its
breast
is
a
splendid
scene
said
oliver
sitting
down
beside
his
friend
it
is
indeed
and
reminds
me
of
the
sea
of
glass
before
the
great
white
throne
that
we
read
of
in
revelation
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
or
to
believe
that
the
peaceful
water
before
us
lying
between
this
spot
and
the
scilly
islands
yonder
was
once
a
land
full
of
verdure
and
life
yet
such
tradition
tells
us
was
the
case
you
mean
i
suppose
the
fabled
land
of
lionesse
said
oliver
yes
you
have
heard
the
story
of
its
destruction
i
suppose
not
i
said
oliver
so
if
you
have
a
mind
to
tell
it
me
while
i
satisfy
the
cravings
of
an
unusually
sharp
appetite
i
consider
you
a
most
obliging
fellow
pass
me
the
knuckle
of
ham
thanks
and
the
bread
now
go
ahead
is
a
romantic
story
said
tregarthen
all
the
better
replied
oliver
and
terrible
added
tregarthen
it
wo
spoil
my
appetite
said
his
friend
well
then
i
tell
it
to
the
best
of
my
ability
the
youth
then
began
the
following
legend
pausing
ever
and
anon
during
the
narration
to
swallow
a
piece
of
bread
or
a
mouthful
of
cold
tea
which
constituted
the
principal
elements
of
their
frugal
meal
you
must
know
that
once
upon
a
time
long
long
ago
in
those
ancient
days
before
norman
or
dane
had
invaded
this
land
while
britain
still
belonged
to
the
british
and
king
arthur
held
his
court
in
halls
there
was
a
goodly
land
named
lethowsow
or
the
lionesse
extending
a
distance
of
thirty
miles
between
this
cape
and
yonder
shadowy
islets
which
seem
to
float
like
cirrus
clouds
on
the
horizon
it
is
said
that
this
land
of
lionesse
was
rich
and
fertile
supporting
many
hundreds
of
families
with
large
flocks
and
herds
there
were
no
fewer
than
forty
churches
upon
it
from
which
it
follows
that
there
must
have
been
a
considerable
population
of
people
there
about
the
time
of
the
events
which
i
am
going
to
narrate
king
reign
was
drawing
to
a
close
treason
had
thinned
the
ranks
of
the
once
united
and
famous
knights
of
the
round
table
it
is
true
that
sir
kaye
the
seneschal
remained
true
and
sir
ector
de
mans
and
sir
caradoc
and
sir
tristram
and
sir
lancelot
of
the
lake
of
whom
it
was
said
that
was
the
kindest
man
that
ever
struck
with
sword
and
he
was
the
goodliest
person
that
ever
rode
among
the
throng
of
knights
and
he
was
the
meekest
man
and
the
gentlest
that
did
ever
eat
in
hall
among
ladies
and
he
was
the
sternest
knight
to
his
mortal
foe
that
ever
laid
lance
in
rest
but
many
seats
at
the
round
table
that
once
were
filled
by
brave
warriors
had
become
empty
and
among
these
that
of
prince
mordred
who
it
was
rumoured
meant
to
declare
open
war
against
his
royal
cousin
and
benefactor
one
night
king
arthur
sat
at
the
round
table
in
tintagel
castle
with
his
knights
gathered
round
him
and
queen
guenever
with
her
maidens
by
his
side
at
the
beginning
of
the
feast
the
king
brow
was
clouded
for
although
there
was
no
lack
of
merriment
or
song
there
was
a
want
of
the
courtesy
and
confidence
of
former
days
still
the
semblance
of
unabated
was
kept
up
and
the
evening
passed
in
gaiety
until
its
close
when
the
king
rose
to
retire
taking
in
his
hand
a
golden
cup
to
pledge
his
guests
he
was
about
to
drink
when
a
shudder
passed
through
his
frame
and
he
cast
the
goblet
away
exclaiming
is
not
wine
but
blood
my
father
merlin
is
among
us
and
there
is
evil
in
the
coming
days
break
we
up
our
court
my
peers
it
is
no
time
for
feasting
but
rather
for
fasting
and
for
prayer
the
king
glanced
with
a
dark
frown
at
the
chair
of
his
kinsman
mordred
but
it
was
not
empty
a
strange
indistinct
shadowy
form
rested
on
it
it
had
no
human
shape
but
a
dreadful
outline
of
something
unearthly
and
silent
the
company
at
once
broke
up
on
the
following
day
news
of
mordred
revolt
arrived
at
tintagel
castle
and
day
after
day
fresh
rumours
reached
it
of
foes
flocking
in
numbers
to
the
rebel
standard
the
army
increased
as
it
advanced
but
strange
to
say
king
arthur
showed
no
disposition
to
sally
forth
and
meet
the
traitor
it
seemed
as
if
his
brave
heart
had
quailed
at
last
and
his
good
sword
excalibur
had
lost
its
magic
virtue
some
thought
that
he
doubted
the
fidelity
of
those
who
still
remained
around
him
but
whatever
the
cause
might
have
been
king
arthur
made
no
preparation
and
indicated
no
feeling
or
intention
he
lay
still
in
his
castle
until
the
rebels
had
approached
to
the
very
gates
there
was
something
terrible
in
this
mysterious
silence
of
the
king
which
had
a
tendency
to
overawe
the
rebels
as
they
drew
near
and
remembered
that
they
were
about
to
match
themselves
against
warriors
who
had
grown
old
in
fellowship
with
victory
when
the
main
body
of
the
invaders
appeared
the
great
bell
of
the
fortress
at
last
rang
out
a
stirring
peal
and
before
the
barbican
the
trumpets
sounded
to
horse
king
arthur
then
with
his
knights
and
the
best
warriors
of
britain
arose
and
sallied
forth
to
fight
in
their
last
battle
next
evening
a
broken
band
of
horsemen
alone
remained
to
tell
of
the
death
of
their
king
and
the
destruction
of
all
their
hopes
they
numbered
several
hundreds
but
their
hacked
armour
jaded
steeds
and
gaping
wounds
told
that
they
were
unfit
to
offer
battle
to
any
foe
they
were
in
full
flight
bearing
a
torn
banner
still
wet
with
the
blood
of
king
arthur
yet
they
fled
unwillingly
as
men
who
were
unused
to
retreat
and
scarce
knew
how
to
comport
them
in
the
novel
circumstances
their
course
was
in
the
direction
of
the
lionesse
the
tract
of
country
called
in
the
cornish
tongue
lethowsow
on
they
dashed
without
uttering
a
word
over
the
bleak
moors
before
them
sometimes
they
halted
to
drink
at
a
spring
or
tighten
their
girths
and
occasionally
a
man
fell
behind
from
sheer
exhaustion
at
night
they
encamped
after
a
hard
ride
of
thirty
miles
next
morning
the
flight
was
resumed
but
the
vindictive
mordred
still
thundered
on
in
pursuit
ere
long
they
heard
a
trumpet
sounding
in
their
rear
and
king
men
halted
for
a
few
minutes
with
the
design
of
facing
the
foe
and
selling
their
lives
dearly
while
they
paused
in
gloomy
irresolution
gazing
sternly
on
the
advancing
host
whose
arms
flashed
back
the
rays
of
the
morning
sun
a
mist
rose
up
between
them
and
their
foes
it
was
a
strange
shadowy
mist
without
distinct
form
yet
not
without
resemblance
to
something
ghostly
the
knights
at
once
recognised
it
as
the
shade
of
merlin
the
great
wizard
slowly
the
cloud
uprose
between
the
pursuers
and
pursued
effectually
protecting
the
latter
nevertheless
although
baffled
the
former
did
not
give
up
the
chase
at
last
mordred
reached
a
lofty
slope
from
the
top
of
which
he
descried
his
enemies
retreating
across
the
land
of
lionesse
mad
with
rage
he
descended
to
the
plain
where
soft
sunlight
shone
through
luxuriant
glades
and
across
the
green
pastures
gladdening
the
hearts
of
man
and
beast
nature
was
all
peaceful
and
gloriously
beautiful
but
mordred
eyes
saw
it
not
his
heart
felt
not
the
sweet
influences
the
bitterness
induced
by
hatred
and
an
evil
conscience
reigned
within
as
he
urged
his
steed
furiously
onward
suddenly
a
terrible
change
occurred
in
the
atmosphere
which
became
oppressively
sultry
and
horrible
while
low
muttering
thunders
were
heard
and
heavings
of
the
earth
felt
at
the
same
time
the
cloud
gradually
condensed
in
front
of
mordred
and
assuming
a
distinct
form
stood
before
him
in
the
person
of
merlin
the
wizard
for
a
few
seconds
they
stood
face
to
face
frowning
on
each
other
in
awful
silence
then
merlin
raised
his
arm
and
immediately
the
thunders
and
confused
mutterings
increased
until
the
earth
began
to
undulate
and
rend
as
if
the
foundations
of
the
world
were
destroyed
great
fissures
appeared
and
the
rocks
welled
up
like
the
waves
of
the
sea
with
a
cry
of
agony
the
pursuers
turned
to
fly
but
it
was
too
late
already
the
earth
was
rent
into
fragments
it
upheaved
convulsively
for
a
few
seconds
then
sank
beneath
the
level
of
the
deep
and
the
ocean
rushed
wildly
over
the
land
leaving
nothing
behind
to
mark
the
spot
where
land
had
been
save
the
peaked
and
barren
rocks
you
see
before
you
with
the
surge
beating
continually
around
them
a
most
extraordinary
tale
truly
said
oliver
do
you
believe
it
has
any
foundation
i
believe
not
the
supernatural
parts
of
it
of
course
replied
tregarthen
but
there
is
in
the
fact
that
the
land
of
cornwall
has
unquestionably
given
up
part
of
its
soil
to
the
sea
you
are
aware
i
suppose
that
michael
mount
the
most
beautiful
and
prominent
object
in
mounts
bay
has
been
described
as
hoare
rock
in
a
wood
about
six
miles
from
the
sea
although
it
now
stands
in
the
bay
and
this
idea
of
a
sunken
land
is
borne
out
by
the
unquestionable
fact
that
if
we
dig
down
a
few
feet
into
the
sand
of
the
shore
near
penzance
we
shall
come
on
a
black
vegetable
mould
full
of
woodland
such
as
branches
leaves
of
coppice
wood
and
nuts
together
with
carbonised
roots
and
trunks
of
forest
trees
of
larger
growth
and
these
have
been
found
as
far
out
as
the
lowest
tide
would
permit
men
to
dig
in
addition
to
this
portions
of
land
have
been
overwhelmed
by
the
sea
near
penzance
in
the
memory
of
men
now
alive
hum
said
oliver
stretching
out
his
huge
limbs
like
a
giant
basking
in
the
sunshine
i
dare
say
you
are
correct
in
your
suppositions
but
i
do
not
profess
to
be
an
antiquary
so
that
i
wo
dispute
the
subject
with
you
at
the
same
time
i
may
observe
that
it
does
seem
to
me
as
if
there
were
a
screw
loose
somewhere
in
the
historical
part
of
your
narrative
for
methinks
i
have
read
heard
or
dreamt
that
king
arthur
was
mordred
uncle
not
his
cousin
and
that
mordred
was
slain
and
that
the
king
was
the
victor
at
the
fatal
field
of
camelford
although
the
victory
was
purchased
dearly
arthur
having
been
mortally
wounded
and
carried
back
to
tintagel
to
die
there
but
of
course
i
pretend
to
doubt
the
truth
of
your
narrative
because
of
such
trifling
discrepancies
as
to
the
encroachment
of
the
sea
on
the
cornish
coast
and
the
evidences
thereof
in
mounts
bay
i
raise
no
objection
thereto
but
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
we
want
stronger
proof
of
the
existence
of
the
land
of
lionesse
why
oliver
said
tregarthen
laughing
you
began
by
saying
that
you
would
not
dispute
the
subject
with
me
and
in
two
minutes
you
have
said
enough
to
have
justified
a
regular
attack
on
my
part
had
i
been
so
disposed
however
we
have
a
long
road
before
us
so
i
must
protest
against
a
passage
of
arms
just
now
having
finished
breakfast
the
two
friends
proceeded
along
the
coast
a
few
miles
to
tolpedenpenwith
here
in
the
midst
of
the
finest
scenery
on
the
coast
they
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
day
and
then
proceeded
to
penberth
cove
intending
to
secure
a
lodging
for
the
night
order
supper
and
while
that
was
in
preparation
pay
a
visit
to
the
famous
logan
rock
penberth
cove
is
one
of
the
prettiest
little
vales
in
the
west
of
cornwall
it
is
enriched
with
groups
of
trees
and
picturesque
cottages
and
possesses
a
luxuriant
growth
of
shrubs
and
underwood
that
almost
conceals
from
view
the
streamlet
which
is
the
chief
cause
of
its
fertility
there
were
also
at
the
time
we
write
of
one
or
two
houses
which
although
not
public
inns
were
open
for
the
entertainment
of
travellers
in
a
fashion
here
therefore
our
excursionists
determined
to
put
up
for
the
night
with
the
widow
of
a
fisherman
who
had
perished
in
a
storm
while
engaged
in
the
herring
fishery
off
the
irish
coast
this
good
woman
chief
physical
characteristic
was
rotundity
and
her
prominent
mental
attribute
she
at
once
received
the
gentlemen
hospitably
and
promised
to
prepare
supper
for
them
while
they
went
to
visit
the
logan
or
logging
rock
which
lay
in
the
vicinity
this
rock
is
one
of
those
freaks
of
nature
which
furnish
food
for
antiquaries
points
of
interest
to
strangers
and
occupation
to
guides
every
one
who
goes
to
the
land
end
must
needs
visit
the
logan
rock
if
he
would
do
the
country
properly
and
if
our
book
were
a
guide
to
cornwall
we
should
feel
bound
to
describe
it
with
much
particularity
referring
to
its
size
form
weight
and
rocking
quality
besides
enlarging
on
the
memorable
incident
in
its
career
when
a
wild
officer
of
the
navy
displaced
it
from
its
pivot
by
means
of
seamen
and
crowbars
and
was
thereafter
ordered
to
replace
it
a
herculean
task
which
he
accomplished
at
great
cost
on
pain
of
we
know
not
what
penalties
but
as
we
make
no
pretensions
to
the
important
office
of
a
guide
we
pass
this
lion
by
with
the
remark
that
oliver
and
his
friend
visited
it
and
rocked
it
and
then
went
back
to
penberth
cove
to
sup
on
pilchards
after
which
followed
a
chat
then
bed
sound
sleep
daybreak
and
breakfast
and
finally
the
road
to
penzance
with
bright
sunshine
light
hearts
and
the
music
of
a
hundred
larks
ringing
in
the
sky
chapter
nineteen
small
talk
and
some
account
of
cornish
fairies
what
a
splendid
country
for
a
painter
of
cliffs
observed
oliver
as
the
friends
walked
briskly
along
i
wonder
much
that
our
artists
do
not
visit
it
more
frequently
perhaps
they
find
metal
more
attractive
nearer
home
replied
tregarthen
all
the
world
has
not
fallen
so
violently
in
love
with
moorland
and
rugged
as
you
seem
to
have
done
besides
the
country
is
somewhat
remote
mayhap
when
a
railway
runs
into
it
which
will
doubtless
be
the
case
before
many
years
pass
by
we
shall
see
knights
of
the
brush
pitching
their
white
tents
on
the
end
meanwhile
we
have
a
few
promising
young
men
of
our
own
who
bid
fair
to
rival
the
great
opie
himself
you
have
heard
of
him
of
course
i
have
heard
of
him
indeed
and
seen
some
of
his
works
but
i
ashamed
to
confess
that
having
left
cornwall
when
very
young
and
been
a
dweller
in
the
far
north
of
the
kingdom
ever
since
i
have
only
known
the
facts
that
he
was
a
celebrated
cornish
artist
and
became
the
president
of
the
royal
academy
can
you
tell
me
anything
of
his
personal
history
not
much
but
i
can
give
you
a
brief
outline
of
his
career
john
opie
was
the
son
of
a
carpenter
of
agnes
near
truro
and
was
discovered
and
extracted
like
a
of
rich
ore
from
the
midst
of
the
by
dr
wolcot
who
was
celebrated
under
the
name
of
peter
pindar
the
doctor
first
observed
and
appreciated
opie
talent
and
resolving
to
bring
him
into
notice
wrote
about
him
until
he
became
celebrated
as
the
wonder
he
also
introduced
people
of
note
to
the
artist
studio
in
london
many
of
whom
sat
for
their
portraits
these
gave
so
much
satisfaction
that
the
reputation
of
the
wonder
spread
far
and
wide
and
orders
came
pouring
in
upon
him
insomuch
that
he
became
a
rich
man
and
a
royal
academician
and
ultimately
president
of
the
academy
he
married
an
authoress
and
his
remains
were
deposited
in
paul
cathedral
near
to
those
of
sir
joshua
reynolds
i
have
heard
my
grandfather
say
that
he
met
him
once
in
the
town
of
helston
and
he
described
him
as
somewhat
rough
and
unpolished
but
a
sterling
man
did
he
paint
landscape
at
all
inquired
oliver
not
much
i
believe
he
devoted
himself
chiefly
to
portraits
well
now
said
oliver
looking
round
him
it
strikes
me
that
this
is
just
the
country
for
a
landscape
painter
there
is
nowhere
else
such
fine
cliff
scenery
and
the
wild
moors
which
remind
me
much
of
scotland
are
worthy
of
being
sketched
by
an
able
brush
people
have
curiously
different
opinions
in
reference
to
the
moors
which
you
admire
so
much
said
tregarthen
a
clergyman
who
lived
and
wrote
not
very
long
ago
came
to
cornwall
in
search
of
the
picturesque
and
he
was
so
disappointed
with
what
he
termed
a
barren
desolate
region
that
he
stopped
suddenly
on
the
road
between
launceston
and
bodmin
and
turned
his
back
on
cornwall
for
ever
as
might
be
expected
such
a
man
gave
a
very
false
idea
of
the
country
on
the
other
hand
a
more
recent
writer
commenting
on
the
first
speaks
of
his
delight
after
having
grown
somewhat
tired
of
the
almost
too
rich
and
scenery
of
kent
on
coming
to
what
he
styled
sombre
apparition
of
the
desert
in
a
corner
of
green
england
and
dwells
with
enthusiasm
on
solitudes
and
hills
crowned
with
rugged
rocks
classical
heaths
and
savage
ravines
possessing
a
character
of
desolate
grandeur
but
this
writer
did
more
he
travelled
through
the
country
and
discovered
that
it
possessed
other
and
not
less
beautiful
features
that
there
were
richly
clothed
vales
and
beautiful
rivulets
cultivated
fields
and
prolific
gardens
in
close
proximity
to
our
grand
cliffs
and
moors
he
might
have
added
said
oliver
that
plants
and
flowers
flourish
in
the
open
air
here
and
attain
to
a
size
and
luxuriance
which
are
rare
in
other
parts
of
england
why
i
have
seen
myrtles
laurels
fuchsias
pomegranates
and
hortensias
forming
hedges
and
growing
on
the
windows
and
walls
of
many
houses
to
my
mind
cornwall
is
one
of
the
finest
counties
in
england
of
which
flora
herself
has
reason
to
be
proud
and
in
which
fairies
as
well
as
giants
might
dwell
with
much
delight
spoken
like
a
true
cornishman
said
tregarthen
laughing
and
in
regard
to
the
fairies
i
may
tell
you
that
we
are
not
without
a
few
of
them
although
giants
confessedly
preponderate
indeed
said
oliver
pray
whereabouts
do
they
dwell
you
have
heard
of
the
gump
i
suppose
what
the
barren
plain
near
carn
kenidjack
to
the
north
of
st
just
the
same
well
this
is
said
to
be
a
celebrated
haunt
of
the
pixies
who
have
often
led
benighted
travellers
astray
and
shown
them
wonderful
sights
of
course
one
never
meets
with
any
individual
who
has
actually
seen
them
but
i
have
frequently
met
with
those
who
have
assured
me
they
had
known
others
who
had
conversed
with
persons
who
had
seen
fairies
one
old
man
in
particular
i
have
heard
of
who
was
quite
convinced
of
the
reality
of
a
fairy
scene
which
he
once
witnessed
this
old
fellow
was
crossing
the
gump
one
evening
by
one
of
the
numerous
paths
which
intersect
it
it
was
the
sun
had
gone
down
beyond
the
and
the
golden
mists
of
evening
were
merging
into
the
quiet
grey
that
hung
over
the
atlantic
not
a
breath
of
wind
passed
over
land
or
sea
to
the
northward
chun
castle
stood
darkly
on
the
summit
of
the
neighbouring
hill
and
the
cromlech
loomed
huge
and
mysterious
southward
were
traces
of
mystic
circles
and
upright
stones
and
other
of
those
inexplicable
pieces
of
antiquity
which
are
usually
saddled
on
the
overladen
shoulders
of
the
druids
everything
in
fact
in
the
scene
the
season
and
the
weather
contributed
to
fill
the
mind
of
the
old
man
with
romantic
musings
as
he
wended
his
way
over
the
barren
moor
suddenly
there
arose
on
the
air
a
sound
of
sweet
soft
music
like
the
gentle
breathings
of
an
aeolian
harp
he
stopped
and
gazed
around
with
looks
of
mingled
curiosity
and
surprise
but
could
see
nothing
unusual
the
mysterious
sounds
continued
and
a
feeling
of
alarm
stole
over
him
for
twilight
was
deepening
and
home
was
still
far
distant
he
attempted
to
advance
but
the
music
had
such
a
charm
for
him
that
he
could
not
quit
the
spot
so
he
turned
aside
to
discover
if
possible
whence
it
came
presently
he
came
to
a
spot
where
the
turf
was
smoother
and
greener
than
elsewhere
and
here
the
most
wonderful
and
enchanting
scene
met
his
gaze
fairies
innumerable
were
before
him
real
live
fairies
and
no
mistake
lying
down
on
the
grass
the
old
man
crept
cautiously
towards
them
and
watched
their
proceedings
with
deep
interest
they
were
evidently
engaged
in
the
pleasant
occupation
of
holding
a
fair
there
were
stalls
tastefully
laid
out
and
decorated
with
garlands
of
flowers
on
these
were
spread
most
temptingly
all
the
little
articles
of
fairy
costume
to
be
sure
the
said
costume
was
very
scanty
and
to
all
appearance
more
picturesque
than
useful
nevertheless
there
was
great
variety
some
wore
jauntily
stuck
on
their
heads
some
were
helmeted
with
golden
blossoms
of
the
furze
and
looked
warlike
others
had
nothing
but
their
own
luxuriant
hair
to
cover
them
a
few
of
the
lady
fairies
struck
the
old
man
as
being
remarkably
beautiful
and
one
of
these
who
wore
an
inverted
tulip
for
a
skirt
with
a
small
in
her
golden
hair
seemed
to
him
the
very
picture
of
what
his
old
molly
had
been
fifty
years
before
it
was
particularly
noticeable
that
the
stalls
were
chiefly
patronised
by
the
fairy
fair
sex
with
the
exception
of
one
or
two
which
were
much
frequented
by
the
men
at
these
latter
articles
were
sold
which
marvellously
resembled
cigars
and
brandy
and
the
old
man
declared
that
he
saw
them
smoke
the
former
and
that
he
smelt
the
latter
but
as
he
had
himself
been
indulging
a
little
that
evening
in
smuggled
spirits
and
tobacco
we
must
regard
this
as
a
somewhat
ungenerous
statement
on
his
part
for
it
is
ridiculous
to
suppose
that
fairies
could
be
such
senseless
creatures
as
to
smoke
or
drink
they
danced
and
sang
however
and
it
was
observed
that
one
young
man
with
a
yellow
and
a
bad
cold
was
particularly
conspicuous
for
his
anxiety
to
be
permitted
to
sing
the
music
was
naturally
the
great
attraction
of
the
evening
it
consisted
of
a
large
band
and
although
some
of
the
performers
used
instruments
made
of
reeds
and
straws
and
other
hollow
substances
cut
into
various
forms
and
lengths
most
of
them
had
noses
which
served
the
purpose
of
musical
instruments
admirably
indeed
the
leader
of
the
band
had
a
prolongation
of
the
nose
so
like
to
a
clarionet
that
it
might
easily
have
been
mistaken
for
the
real
thing
and
on
this
he
discoursed
the
most
seraphic
music
another
fairy
beside
him
had
a
much
longer
nose
which
he
used
as
a
trombone
with
great
effect
this
fellow
was
quite
a
character
and
played
with
such
tremendous
energy
that
on
more
than
one
occasion
he
brought
on
a
fit
of
sneezing
which
of
course
interrupted
the
music
and
put
the
clarionet
in
a
passion
a
stout
old
misshapen
gnome
or
some
such
creature
with
an
enormous
head
served
for
the
big
drum
four
fairies
held
him
down
and
a
fifth
belaboured
his
head
with
a
drumstick
it
sounded
wonderfully
hollow
and
convinced
the
old
man
that
it
was
destitute
of
brains
and
not
subject
to
headache
all
the
time
that
the
old
man
gazed
at
them
troops
of
fairies
continued
to
arrive
some
on
the
backs
of
bats
from
which
they
slipped
as
they
whirred
past
others
descending
apparently
on
moonbeams
the
old
man
even
fancied
that
he
saw
one
attempting
to
descend
by
a
starbeam
which
being
apparently
too
weak
to
support
his
weight
broke
and
let
him
down
with
a
crash
into
the
midst
of
a
party
who
were
very
busy
round
a
refreshment
stall
where
a
liberal
supply
of
mountain
dew
was
being
served
out
but
the
old
man
never
felt
quite
sure
upon
this
point
for
at
sight
of
the
mountain
dew
he
felt
so
thirsty
that
he
determined
to
taste
it
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
stall
he
suddenly
threw
his
hat
into
the
midst
of
the
party
and
made
a
dash
at
it
but
to
his
intense
disappointment
the
vision
was
instantly
dispelled
and
nothing
was
to
be
seen
on
the
spot
but
a
few
snails
creeping
over
the
wet
grass
and
gossamer
threads
bespangled
with
dewdrops
a
very
pretty
little
vision
exclaimed
oliver
and
not
the
first
that
has
been
prematurely
dispelled
by
too
ardent
a
pursuit
of
strong
drink
and
now
charlie
as
you
appear
to
be
in
the
vein
and
we
have
still
some
distance
to
go
will
you
tell
me
something
about
the
giants
and
how
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
so
fond
of
roaming
about
cornwall
their
fondness
for
it
oliver
must
be
ascribed
to
the
same
cause
as
your
own
just
because
it
is
a
lovable
place
said
tregarthen
moreover
being
a
county
they
were
probably
not
much
disturbed
in
their
enjoyment
of
it
to
recount
their
surprising
deeds
would
require
a
longer
space
of
time
than
is
just
now
at
our
disposal
but
you
have
only
to
look
round
in
passing
through
the
country
to
understand
what
a
mighty
race
of
men
they
were
there
are
quoits
as
you
know
without
end
some
of
which
have
the
marks
of
the
fingers
and
thumbs
with
which
they
grasped
them
their
strength
may
be
estimated
by
the
fact
that
one
of
these
quoits
is
no
less
than
forty
feet
long
and
twenty
wide
and
weighs
some
hundreds
of
tons
it
would
puzzle
even
your
strong
arm
to
toss
such
a
quoit
one
of
these
giants
was
a
very
notable
fellow
he
was
named
and
is
said
to
have
been
in
the
habit
of
quenching
his
thirst
at
the
holy
well
under
agnes
beacon
where
the
marks
of
his
hands
made
in
the
solid
granite
while
he
stooped
to
drink
may
still
be
seen
this
rascal
who
was
well
named
is
said
to
have
compelled
poor
agnes
in
revenge
for
her
refusing
to
listen
to
his
addresses
to
carry
in
her
apron
to
the
top
of
beacon
hill
the
pile
of
stones
which
lies
there
but
here
we
are
at
penzance
so
we
shall
have
done
with
fiction
for
the
present
and
revert
to
matters
of
fact
you
have
business
with
a
lawyer
i
believe
and
i
have
business
for
a
short
time
with
a
friend
let
us
appoint
a
time
and
place
of
meeting
what
say
you
to
the
wherry
mine
at
two
said
oliver
it
is
probable
that
my
business
will
be
concluded
by
that
time
when
we
can
go
and
see
this
mine
together
my
uncle
seems
to
set
great
store
by
it
because
of
an
old
prophecy
to
the
effect
that
some
day
or
other
it
will
enrich
somebody
why
that
prophecy
has
been
fulfilled
long
ago
said
tregarthen
with
a
laugh
the
mine
was
a
bold
undertaking
and
at
one
time
paid
well
but
i
fear
it
wo
do
so
again
however
let
us
meet
there
so
farewell
old
boy
till
two
chapter
twenty
the
mine
in
the
sea
true
to
their
appointment
young
tregarthen
and
oliver
trembath
met
at
the
western
end
of
the
town
of
penzance
close
to
the
where
a
mass
of
buildings
and
a
chimney
indicated
the
position
of
the
wherry
mine
oliver
countenance
betrayed
anxiety
as
he
came
forward
nothing
wrong
i
hope
said
tregarthen
well
i
ca
say
exactly
that
things
are
wrong
but
at
the
same
time
i
do
know
that
they
are
altogether
right
much
the
same
thing
said
tregarthen
smiling
come
oliver
unbosom
yourself
as
novelists
say
it
will
do
you
good
and
two
heads
you
know
are
better
than
one
it
not
easy
to
unbosom
myself
old
fellow
returned
oliver
with
a
troubled
look
for
my
poor
uncle
affairs
are
in
a
perplexed
condition
and
i
hate
explanations
especially
when
i
do
understand
the
nature
of
what
i
attempt
to
explain
so
we
not
talk
about
it
please
till
after
our
visit
to
the
mine
let
it
suffice
to
say
that
that
notorious
smuggler
jim
cuttance
is
concerned
in
it
and
that
we
must
go
to
newlyn
this
afternoon
on
a
piece
of
business
which
i
shall
afterwards
disclose
meanwhile
where
is
this
mine
lift
up
your
eyes
and
behold
said
tregarthen
pointing
to
an
object
which
was
surrounded
by
the
sea
and
stood
above
two
hundred
yards
from
the
beach
what
that
object
exclaimed
oliver
in
much
surprise
even
so
replied
tregarthen
who
thereupon
proceeded
to
give
his
friend
a
history
and
description
of
the
mine
of
which
the
following
is
the
substance
at
the
western
extremity
of
the
at
penzance
there
is
a
reef
of
sunken
rocks
which
shows
its
black
crest
above
water
at
low
tide
it
was
discovered
that
this
reef
contained
tin
and
the
people
of
the
town
attacked
it
with
hammers
and
chisels
when
each
receding
tide
left
it
exposed
as
long
as
the
seasons
would
permit
until
the
depth
became
unmanageable
after
having
been
excavated
a
few
fathoms
the
work
was
abandoned
fortunately
for
the
progress
of
this
world
there
exist
a
few
enterprising
men
whom
nothing
can
discourage
who
seem
to
be
spurred
on
by
opposition
and
to
gather
additional
vigour
and
resolution
from
increasing
difficulties
these
men
are
not
numerous
but
the
world
is
seldom
without
a
few
of
them
and
one
made
his
appearance
in
penzance
about
the
end
of
last
century
in
the
person
of
a
poor
miner
named
thomas
curtis
this
man
conceived
the
bold
design
of
sinking
a
shaft
through
this
rock
and
thus
creating
a
mine
not
only
but
the
sea
with
the
energy
peculiar
to
his
class
he
set
to
work
the
distance
of
the
rock
from
the
beach
was
about
two
hundred
and
forty
yards
the
depth
of
water
above
it
at
spring
tides
about
nineteen
feet
being
exposed
to
the
open
sea
a
considerable
surf
is
raised
on
it
at
times
by
the
prevailing
winds
even
in
summer
while
in
winter
the
sea
bursts
over
with
such
force
as
to
render
all
operations
on
it
impossible
that
curtis
was
a
man
of
no
common
force
of
character
is
obvious
from
the
fact
that
apart
from
the
difficulties
of
the
undertaking
he
could
not
expect
to
derive
any
profit
whatever
from
his
labour
for
several
years
as
the
work
could
only
be
carried
on
during
the
short
period
of
time
in
which
the
rock
was
above
water
and
part
of
this
brief
period
must
necessarily
be
consumed
each
tide
in
pumping
out
the
water
in
the
excavation
it
of
course
progressed
slowly
three
summers
were
consumed
in
sinking
the
after
this
a
framework
or
caisson
of
stout
timber
and
boards
was
built
round
the
mouth
of
the
shaft
and
rendered
watertight
with
pitch
and
oakum
it
rose
to
a
height
of
about
twelve
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
was
strengthened
and
supported
by
stout
bars
or
buttresses
of
timber
a
platform
was
placed
on
the
top
and
a
windlass
at
which
four
men
could
work
was
fixed
thereon
this
erection
was
connected
with
the
shore
by
a
stage
or
wherry
erected
on
piles
the
water
was
cleared
out
the
men
went
underground
and
with
the
sea
rolling
over
their
heads
and
lashing
wildly
round
the
turret
which
was
their
only
safeguard
from
terrible
and
instant
destruction
they
hewed
daily
from
the
submarine
rock
a
considerable
portion
of
tin
these
first
workers
however
had
committed
an
error
in
carrying
on
their
operations
too
near
the
surface
so
that
water
permeated
freely
through
the
rock
and
the
risk
of
the
pressure
above
being
too
great
for
it
rendered
the
introduction
of
immense
supporting
timbers
necessary
the
water
too
forced
its
way
through
the
shaft
during
the
winter
months
so
that
the
regular
working
of
the
mine
could
not
be
carried
on
except
in
summer
nevertheless
this
short
interval
was
sufficient
to
enable
the
projector
to
raise
so
much
ore
that
his
mine
got
the
reputation
of
being
a
profitable
adventure
and
it
was
wrought
successfully
for
many
years
about
the
end
of
the
century
the
depth
of
the
was
about
four
fathoms
and
the
roof
had
been
cut
away
to
the
thinness
of
three
feet
in
some
places
twelve
men
were
employed
for
two
hours
at
the
windlass
in
hauling
the
water
while
six
others
were
teaming
from
the
bottom
into
the
pump
when
sufficient
water
had
been
cleared
away
the
men
laboured
at
the
rock
for
six
hours
in
all
eight
hours
at
a
time
the
prolific
nature
of
the
mine
may
be
gathered
from
the
fact
that
in
the
space
of
six
months
ten
men
working
about
one
tenth
of
that
time
less
than
three
weeks
broke
about
pounds
worth
of
during
one
summer
pounds
worth
of
tin
was
raised
a
was
ultimately
attached
to
the
works
and
the
mine
was
sunk
to
a
depth
of
sixteen
fathoms
but
the
expense
of
working
it
at
length
became
so
great
that
it
was
abandoned
not
however
before
ore
to
the
amount
of
pounds
had
been
raised
from
under
the
sea
at
the
time
of
our
tale
another
effort
had
been
made
to
work
the
wherry
mine
and
great
expectations
had
been
raised
but
these
expectations
were
being
disappointed
our
unfortunate
friend
mr
donnithorne
was
among
the
number
of
those
who
had
cause
to
regret
having
ventured
to
invest
in
the
undertaking
and
it
was
to
make
inquiries
in
regard
to
certain
unfavourable
rumours
touching
the
mine
that
oliver
trembath
had
been
sent
to
penzance
after
inspecting
wherry
mine
the
two
friends
walked
along
the
shore
together
and
oliver
explained
the
nature
of
the
difficulties
in
which
his
uncle
was
involved
the
fact
is
charlie
he
said
an
old
of
newlyn
named
hitchin
is
one
of
the
principal
shareholders
in
this
concern
he
is
as
rich
they
say
as
croesus
and
if
we
could
only
prevail
on
him
to
be
amiable
the
thing
might
be
carried
on
for
some
time
longer
with
every
hope
of
a
favourable
result
for
there
can
be
no
doubt
whatever
that
there
is
plenty
of
tin
in
the
mine
yet
and
the
getting
of
it
out
is
only
a
question
of
time
and
capital
a
pretty
serious
question
as
most
speculators
find
said
tregarthen
laughing
you
appear
to
think
lightly
of
it
well
i
do
pretend
to
know
much
about
such
matters
replied
oliver
but
whatever
may
be
the
truth
of
the
case
old
hitchin
refuses
to
come
forward
he
says
that
he
is
low
in
funds
just
now
which
nobody
seems
to
believe
and
that
he
owes
an
immense
sum
of
money
to
jim
cuttance
the
smuggler
for
what
of
course
he
will
not
tell
but
we
can
have
no
difficulty
in
guessing
he
says
that
cuttance
is
pressing
him
just
now
and
that
therefore
he
can
not
afford
to
advance
anything
on
the
mine
this
being
the
case
it
must
go
down
and
if
it
does
one
of
the
last
few
gleams
of
prosperity
that
remain
to
my
poor
uncle
will
have
fluttered
away
this
must
be
prevented
if
possible
and
it
is
with
that
end
in
view
that
i
purpose
going
to
newlyn
this
afternoon
to
see
hitchin
and
bring
my
persuasive
powers
to
bear
on
him
h
not
of
much
use
i
fear
said
tregarthen
hitchin
is
a
tough
old
rascal
with
a
hard
heart
and
a
miserly
disposition
however
it
may
be
worth
while
to
make
the
attempt
for
you
have
a
very
oily
tongue
oliver
and
you
have
an
extremely
impudent
one
charlie
but
can
you
tell
me
at
what
time
the
mackerel
boats
may
be
expected
this
evening
for
it
seems
the
old
fellow
is
not
often
to
be
found
at
home
during
the
day
and
we
shall
be
pretty
sure
to
find
him
on
the
beach
when
the
boats
arrive
thus
appealed
to
tregarthen
cast
a
long
look
at
the
sea
and
sky
well
i
should
say
considering
the
state
of
the
tide
and
the
threatening
appearance
of
the
sky
we
may
expect
to
see
them
at
six
or
thereabouts
that
leaves
us
nearly
a
couple
of
hours
to
spare
how
shall
we
spend
it
said
oliver
go
and
have
a
look
at
this
fine
old
town
suggested
tregarthen
it
is
worth
going
over
i
assure
you
besides
the
town
hall
market
museum
etcetera
there
are
from
many
points
of
the
surrounding
eminences
most
superb
views
of
the
town
and
bay
with
our
noble
michael
mount
the
view
from
some
of
the
heights
has
been
said
by
some
visitors
to
equal
that
of
the
bay
of
naples
itself
part
of
this
i
have
already
seen
said
oliver
the
rest
i
hope
to
live
to
see
but
in
the
meantime
tin
is
uppermost
in
my
mind
so
if
you
have
no
objection
i
should
like
to
have
a
look
at
the
works
what
say
you
agreed
by
all
means
cried
tregarthen
poor
indeed
would
be
the
spirit
of
the
cornishman
who
did
not
feel
an
interest
in
tin
chapter
twenty
one
treats
of
and
other
matters
there
is
something
grand
in
the
progress
of
a
mechanical
process
from
its
commencement
to
its
termination
especially
is
this
the
case
in
the
production
of
metals
nearly
every
step
in
the
course
of
which
is
marked
by
the
hard
unyielding
spirit
of
on
the
one
hand
and
the
tremendous
power
of
intelligence
machinery
and
manual
dexterity
on
the
other
take
for
example
the
progress
of
a
mass
of
tin
from
botallack
watch
yonder
stalwart
miner
at
work
deep
in
the
bowels
of
the
mine
slowly
with
powerful
blows
he
bores
a
hole
in
the
hard
rock
after
one
two
or
three
hours
of
incessant
toil
it
is
ready
for
the
powder
it
is
charged
the
match
is
applied
the
man
takes
shelter
behind
a
projection
the
mass
is
rent
from
its
ancient
bed
and
the
miner
goes
off
to
lunch
while
the
smoke
is
clearing
away
he
returns
to
his
work
at
length
coughing
and
rubbing
his
eyes
for
smoke
still
lingers
there
unable
it
would
seem
to
find
its
way
out
and
no
wonder
lost
as
it
is
in
intricate
ramifications
at
the
depth
of
about
one
thousand
five
hundred
feet
below
the
green
grass
he
finds
but
a
small
piece
of
ore
perhaps
it
is
twice
the
size
of
his
head
it
may
be
much
larger
but
in
any
case
it
is
an
apparently
poor
return
for
the
labour
expended
he
adds
it
however
to
the
pile
at
his
side
and
when
that
is
sufficiently
large
fills
a
little
iron
wagon
and
sends
it
up
to
grass
through
the
shaft
by
means
of
the
iron
kibble
here
the
large
pieces
of
ore
are
broken
into
smaller
ones
by
a
man
with
a
hammer
as
far
as
the
inexperienced
eye
can
distinguish
he
might
be
breaking
ordinary
stones
to
repair
the
road
these
are
then
taken
to
the
stamps
those
who
have
delicate
nerves
would
do
well
to
keep
as
far
as
possible
from
the
stamps
of
a
enormous
hammers
or
pounders
they
are
with
shanks
as
well
as
heads
of
each
weighing
shank
and
head
together
seven
hundredweight
they
are
fearful
things
these
stamps
iron
in
spirit
as
well
as
in
body
for
they
go
on
for
ever
night
and
day
wrought
by
a
of
one
hundred
as
enduring
as
themselves
the
stamps
are
so
arranged
as
to
be
by
means
of
huge
wooden
troughs
with
sloping
bottoms
into
which
the
ore
is
thrown
in
quantities
sufficient
to
keep
them
constantly
at
work
without
requiring
much
or
constant
attendance
small
streams
of
water
trickle
over
the
ore
to
keep
it
slowly
sliding
down
towards
the
jaws
where
the
stamps
thunder
up
and
down
alternately
a
dread
power
of
pounding
have
they
truly
and
woe
be
to
the
toe
that
should
chance
to
get
beneath
them
the
rock
they
have
to
deal
with
is
as
we
have
said
uncommonly
hard
and
it
enters
the
insatiable
mouth
of
the
stamps
about
the
size
of
a
man
fist
on
the
average
but
it
comes
out
from
these
iron
jaws
so
exceeding
fine
as
to
be
incapable
of
thickening
the
stream
of
water
that
carries
it
away
the
colour
of
the
stream
is
the
result
of
iron
with
which
the
tin
is
mingled
the
particles
of
tin
are
indeed
set
free
by
the
stamps
from
solid
bondage
but
they
are
so
fine
as
to
be
scarcely
visible
and
so
commingled
with
other
substances
such
as
iron
copper
sulphur
etcetera
that
a
tedious
process
of
separation
has
yet
to
be
undergone
before
the
bright
metal
can
be
seen
or
handled
at
the
present
time
the
stream
containing
it
is
poured
continuously
on
several
huge
wooden
tables
these
tables
are
each
slightly
raised
in
the
centre
where
the
stream
falls
so
that
all
the
water
runs
off
leaving
the
various
substances
it
contains
deposited
on
the
table
and
these
substances
are
spread
over
it
regularly
while
being
deposited
by
revolving
washers
or
brushes
tin
being
the
heaviest
of
all
the
ingredients
contained
in
the
stream
falls
at
once
to
the
bottom
and
is
therefore
deposited
on
the
head
or
centre
of
the
table
iron
being
a
shade
lighter
is
found
to
lodge
in
a
circle
beyond
while
all
other
substances
are
either
spread
over
the
outer
rim
or
washed
entirely
away
when
the
tables
are
full
that
is
coated
with
what
appears
to
be
an
earthy
substance
up
wards
of
a
foot
in
depth
the
rich
tin
in
the
centre
is
carefully
cut
out
with
shovels
and
placed
in
tubs
while
the
rest
is
rewashed
in
order
that
the
tin
still
mingled
with
it
may
be
captured
a
process
involving
much
difficulty
for
tin
is
so
very
little
heavier
than
iron
that
the
lighter
particles
can
scarcely
be
separated
even
after
repeated
and
careful
washings
in
old
times
the
tin
was
collected
in
large
pits
whence
it
was
transferred
to
the
hands
of
balmaidens
or
to
be
washed
by
them
in
wooden
troughs
called
frames
which
somewhat
resembled
a
billiard
table
in
form
indeed
the
frames
are
still
largely
employed
in
the
mines
but
these
and
the
modern
table
perform
exactly
the
same
office
they
wash
the
refuse
from
the
tin
being
finally
cleansed
from
all
its
impurities
our
mass
of
tin
bears
more
resemblance
to
brown
snuff
than
to
metal
an
ignorant
man
would
suppose
it
to
be
an
ordinary
earthy
substance
until
he
took
some
of
it
in
his
hand
and
felt
its
weight
it
contains
however
comparatively
little
foreign
substance
about
seventy
per
cent
of
it
is
pure
tin
but
this
seventy
per
cent
is
still
locked
up
in
the
tight
embrace
of
thirty
per
cent
of
refuse
from
which
nothing
but
intense
fire
can
set
it
free
at
this
point
in
the
process
our
mass
of
tin
leaves
the
rough
hand
of
the
miner
in
former
days
it
was
divided
among
the
shareholders
in
this
form
each
receiving
instead
of
cash
so
many
sacks
of
tin
ore
according
to
the
number
of
his
shares
or
doles
and
carrying
it
off
on
mule
or
horse
back
from
the
mine
to
be
smelted
where
or
by
whom
he
pleased
but
whether
treated
in
this
way
or
as
in
the
present
day
sold
by
the
manager
at
the
market
value
it
all
comes
at
last
to
the
whose
further
proceedings
we
shall
now
follow
in
company
with
oliver
and
his
friend
the
agent
of
the
smelting
company
a
stout
intelligent
man
who
evidently
did
knaw
tin
conducted
them
first
to
the
furnaces
in
the
neighbourhood
of
which
were
ranged
a
number
of
large
wooden
troughs
or
bins
all
more
or
less
filled
with
tin
ore
the
ore
got
from
different
mines
he
said
differed
in
quality
as
well
as
in
the
percentage
of
tin
which
it
contained
some
had
much
iron
mixed
with
it
in
spite
of
all
the
washings
it
had
undergone
some
had
a
little
copper
and
other
substances
while
some
was
very
pure
by
mixing
the
tin
of
different
mines
better
metal
could
be
procured
than
by
simply
smelting
the
produce
of
each
mine
separately
pointing
to
one
of
the
bins
about
three
yards
square
he
told
them
it
contained
tin
worth
pounds
there
was
a
large
quantity
of
black
sand
in
one
of
the
bins
which
the
agent
said
was
got
by
the
process
of
streaming
it
is
the
richest
and
best
kind
of
tin
ore
and
used
to
be
procured
in
large
quantities
in
cornwall
especially
in
ancient
times
being
found
near
the
surface
but
as
a
matter
of
course
not
much
of
that
is
to
be
found
now
the
land
having
been
turned
over
three
times
in
search
of
it
this
black
sand
is
now
imported
in
large
quantities
from
singapore
the
agent
then
conducted
his
visitors
to
the
where
he
showed
them
the
process
of
testing
the
various
qualities
of
tin
ore
offered
to
the
house
for
sale
first
he
weighed
out
twenty
parts
of
the
ore
which
as
we
have
said
resembled
snuff
this
he
remarked
contained
about
of
pure
tin
the
remaining
being
dross
he
mixed
it
with
four
parts
of
fine
coal
dust
or
culm
and
added
a
little
borax
these
last
ingredients
being
intended
to
expedite
the
smelting
process
this
compound
was
put
into
a
crucible
and
subjected
to
the
intense
heat
of
a
small
furnace
for
about
twenty
minutes
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
agent
seized
the
crucible
with
a
pair
of
tongs
poured
the
metal
into
an
iron
mould
and
threw
away
the
dross
the
little
mass
of
tin
thus
produced
was
about
four
inches
long
by
half
an
inch
broad
and
of
a
dull
colour
it
was
then
put
into
an
iron
ladle
and
melted
as
one
would
melt
lead
when
about
to
cast
bullets
but
it
was
particularly
noteworthy
here
that
a
very
slight
heat
was
required
to
extract
the
metal
from
the
tin
ore
a
fierce
heat
long
applied
was
necessary
but
a
slight
heat
continued
for
a
few
minutes
sufficed
to
melt
the
metal
this
remelted
metal
was
poured
into
a
stone
mould
where
it
lay
like
a
bright
little
pool
of
liquid
silver
in
a
few
seconds
it
solidified
retaining
its
clear
purity
in
all
its
parts
that
said
the
agent
is
tin
of
the
very
best
quality
we
sell
it
chiefly
to
dyers
who
use
it
for
colouring
purposes
and
for
whom
no
tin
but
the
best
is
of
any
use
i
will
now
show
you
two
other
qualities
namely
second
and
inferior
he
went
to
a
small
cupboard
as
he
spoke
and
took
therefrom
a
small
piece
of
tin
which
had
already
gone
through
the
smelting
process
in
the
crucible
above
described
melting
this
in
the
ladle
he
poured
it
into
the
mould
where
it
lay
for
a
few
moments
quite
bright
and
pure
but
the
instant
it
solidified
a
slight
dimness
clouded
its
centre
that
explained
the
agent
is
caused
by
a
little
copper
which
they
have
failed
to
extract
from
the
tin
such
tin
would
not
do
for
the
dyers
but
it
is
good
for
the
makers
who
by
dipping
thin
sheets
of
iron
into
molten
tin
produce
the
of
which
our
and
pans
etcetera
are
manufactured
this
last
bit
gentlemen
he
added
taking
a
third
piece
of
tin
from
the
cupboard
is
our
worst
quality
having
melted
it
he
poured
it
into
the
mould
where
it
assumed
a
dull
appearance
as
if
it
were
a
liquid
only
half
frozen
or
if
you
prefer
it
a
solid
in
a
half
molten
state
this
is
only
fit
to
mix
with
copper
and
make
brass
said
the
agent
throwing
down
the
mould
we
test
the
tin
ore
twice
once
to
find
out
the
quantity
of
metal
it
contains
and
again
to
ascertain
its
quality
the
latter
process
you
have
seen
the
former
is
just
the
same
with
this
difference
that
i
am
much
more
careful
in
weighing
measuring
etcetera
every
particle
of
dross
i
would
have
collected
and
carefully
separated
from
any
metal
it
might
contain
the
whole
should
then
have
been
reweighed
and
its
reduction
in
the
smelting
process
ascertained
thus
if
twenty
parts
had
been
the
weight
of
tin
ore
the
result
might
perhaps
have
been
fourteen
parts
of
metal
and
six
parts
of
dross
and
now
gentlemen
having
explained
to
you
the
testing
process
if
you
will
follow
me
i
will
show
you
the
opening
of
one
of
our
furnaces
the
just
shows
the
testing
process
on
a
large
scale
into
this
furnace
six
hours
ago
he
said
pointing
to
a
brick
erection
in
the
building
to
which
he
led
them
we
threw
a
large
quantity
of
tin
ore
mingled
with
a
certain
proportion
of
culm
it
is
smelted
and
ready
to
be
run
off
now
here
he
gave
an
order
to
a
sturdy
man
who
with
brawny
arms
bared
to
the
shoulders
stood
close
at
hand
he
was
begrimed
and
hairy
like
a
very
vulcan
seizing
an
iron
poker
vulcan
probed
the
orifice
of
the
furnace
and
forthwith
there
ran
out
a
stream
of
liquid
fire
which
was
caught
in
an
iron
bowl
nearly
four
feet
in
diameter
the
intense
heat
of
this
pool
caused
the
visitors
to
step
back
a
few
paces
and
the
ruddy
glow
shone
with
a
fierce
glare
on
the
swart
frowning
countenance
of
vulcan
who
appeared
to
take
a
stern
delight
in
braving
it
oliver
attention
was
at
once
attracted
to
this
man
for
he
felt
convinced
that
he
had
seen
his
face
before
but
it
was
not
until
he
had
taxed
his
memory
for
several
minutes
that
the
scene
of
his
adventure
with
the
smugglers
near
the
land
end
flashed
upon
him
when
he
at
once
recognised
him
as
the
man
named
joe
tonkin
who
had
threatened
his
life
in
the
cavern
from
a
peculiar
look
that
the
man
gave
him
he
saw
that
he
also
was
recognised
oliver
took
no
further
notice
of
him
at
the
time
however
but
turned
to
watch
the
flow
of
the
molten
tin
when
the
iron
cauldron
was
almost
full
slag
or
molten
refuse
began
to
flow
and
cover
the
top
of
the
metal
the
hole
was
immediately
plugged
up
by
vulcan
and
the
furnace
cleared
out
for
the
reception
of
another
supply
of
ore
the
surface
of
the
tin
was
now
cleared
of
slag
after
which
it
was
ladled
into
moulds
and
allowed
to
cool
this
was
the
first
process
completed
but
the
tin
was
still
full
of
impurities
and
had
to
undergo
another
melting
and
stirring
in
a
huge
cauldron
this
latter
was
a
severe
and
protracted
operation
which
vulcan
performed
with
tremendous
power
and
energy
in
reference
to
this
it
may
interest
the
reader
to
mention
a
valuable
discovery
which
was
the
result
of
laziness
a
man
who
was
employed
in
a
establishment
at
this
laborious
work
of
stirring
the
molten
metal
in
order
to
purify
it
accidentally
discovered
that
a
piece
of
green
wood
dropped
into
it
had
the
effect
of
causing
it
to
bubble
as
if
it
were
boiling
to
ease
himself
of
some
of
his
toil
he
availed
himself
of
the
discovery
and
by
stirring
the
metal
with
a
piece
of
green
wood
caused
such
a
commotion
that
the
end
in
view
was
accomplished
much
more
effectually
and
speedily
than
by
the
old
process
the
lazy
man
plan
we
need
scarcely
add
is
now
universally
adopted
the
last
operation
was
to
run
the
metal
into
moulds
with
the
name
on
them
and
these
ingots
being
of
portable
size
were
ready
for
sale
while
the
agent
was
busily
engaged
in
explaining
to
charles
tregarthen
some
portions
of
the
work
oliver
stepped
aside
and
accosted
joe
tonkin
so
friend
he
said
with
a
smile
it
seems
that
smuggling
is
not
your
only
business
no
sur
it
ai
replied
joe
with
a
grin
i
a
a
smelter
as
you
do
see
an
a
miner
when
it
suits
me
i
glad
to
hear
it
my
man
for
it
gives
you
a
chance
of
coming
in
contact
with
better
men
than
smugglers
although
i
free
to
confess
that
there
some
good
among
them
too
i
do
forget
that
your
comrade
jim
cuttance
hauled
me
out
of
the
sea
where
is
he
do
knaw
sur
replied
tonkin
with
an
angry
frown
he
and
i
pull
well
together
we
parted
now
oliver
glanced
at
the
man
and
as
he
observed
his
stern
proud
expression
of
face
and
his
huge
powerful
frame
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
cuttance
had
met
a
man
of
equal
power
and
force
of
character
with
himself
and
was
glad
to
get
rid
of
him
but
i
have
not
up
smuggling
added
the
man
with
a
smile
it
do
pay
pretty
well
and
is
more
than
this
sort
o
thing
i
advise
you
to
fall
back
on
mining
said
oliver
it
is
hard
work
i
know
but
it
is
honest
labour
and
as
far
as
i
have
seen
there
does
not
appear
to
be
a
more
free
hearty
and
independent
race
under
the
sun
than
cornish
miners
joe
tonkin
shook
his
head
and
smiled
dubiously
you
do
think
so
sur
but
you
have
tried
it
i
do
like
it
it
do
suit
me
it
do
no
no
there
nothin
like
a
good
boat
and
the
open
sea
things
are
looking
a
little
better
at
botallack
just
now
joe
said
oliver
after
a
pause
i
strongly
advise
you
to
try
it
again
the
man
remained
silent
for
a
few
minutes
then
he
said
well
mr
trembath
i
do
mind
if
i
do
i
tired
o
this
work
and
as
my
time
is
up
this
very
day
i
go
over
and
see
it
there
a
man
at
newlyn
as
i
got
somethin
to
say
to
i
go
see
him
and
then
come
along
oliver
shouted
tregarthen
at
that
moment
it
time
to
go
oliver
bade
tonkin
and
turning
hastily
away
followed
his
friend
the
two
proceeded
arm
in
arm
up
street
and
turning
down
towards
the
shore
walked
briskly
along
in
the
direction
of
the
picturesque
fishing
village
of
newlyn
which
lies
little
more
than
a
mile
to
the
westward
of
penzance
chapter
twenty
two
shows
how
oliver
and
his
friend
went
to
newlyn
and
saw
the
mackerel
market
and
found
some
difficulties
and
mysteries
awaiting
them
there
the
beach
opposite
newlyn
presented
a
busy
scene
when
oliver
trembath
and
his
friend
charlie
tregarthen
reached
it
although
the
zenith
of
the
season
was
over
mackerel
fishing
was
still
going
on
there
in
full
vigour
and
immense
crowds
of
men
women
and
children
covered
the
sands
the
village
lies
on
the
heights
above
and
crowds
of
people
were
leaning
over
the
iron
rails
which
guard
the
unwary
or
unsteady
passenger
from
falling
into
the
sea
below
a
steep
causeway
connects
the
main
street
above
with
the
shore
beneath
and
up
and
down
it
horses
carts
and
people
were
hurrying
continuously
true
there
was
not
at
that
time
quite
as
much
bustle
as
may
be
witnessed
there
at
the
present
day
the
railway
has
penetrated
these
remote
regions
of
the
west
and
now
men
work
with
a
degree
of
feverish
haste
that
was
unknown
then
while
hundreds
of
little
boats
tenders
to
the
large
ones
crowd
in
on
the
beach
auctioneers
with
long
heavy
boots
wade
into
the
water
followed
and
surrounded
by
purchasers
and
ringing
a
bell
as
each
boat
comes
in
shout
now
then
five
hundred
more
or
less
in
this
boat
who
bids
twenty
shillings
a
hundred
for
five
hundred
twenty
shillings
say
nineteen
i
bid
nineteen
say
twenty
twenty
shillings
i
bid
say
shall
i
make
it
shillings
for
any
person
etcetera
the
bells
and
voices
of
these
auctioneers
loud
though
they
be
are
mild
compared
with
the
shouts
of
men
women
and
children
as
the
fish
are
packed
in
baskets
with
hot
haste
to
be
in
time
for
the
train
and
horses
with
laden
carts
gallop
away
over
the
sands
at
furious
speed
while
others
come
dashing
back
for
more
fish
and
there
is
need
for
all
this
furious
haste
for
trains
like
time
and
tide
wait
for
no
man
and
prices
vary
according
to
trains
just
before
the
starting
of
one
you
will
hear
the
auctioneers
put
the
fish
up
at
shillings
shillings
and
even
shillings
a
hundred
and
in
the
next
after
the
train
is
gone
and
no
chance
remains
of
any
more
of
the
fish
being
got
into
the
london
market
by
the
following
morning
the
price
suddenly
falls
to
shillings
a
hundred
sometimes
even
less
there
is
need
for
haste
too
because
the
quantity
of
fish
is
very
great
for
there
are
sometimes
two
hundred
boats
at
anchor
in
the
bay
each
with
four
thousand
fish
on
the
average
which
must
all
be
washed
and
packed
in
four
or
five
hours
yes
the
old
days
can
not
be
compared
with
the
present
times
when
between
the
months
of
april
and
june
the
three
hundred
boats
of
mounts
bay
will
land
little
short
of
three
thousand
tons
of
mackerel
and
the
railway
for
the
mere
carriage
of
these
to
london
manchester
birmingham
etcetera
will
clear
above
pounds
nevertheless
the
busy
bustling
hearty
nature
of
the
scene
on
newlyn
beach
in
days
of
yore
was
not
so
very
different
as
one
might
suppose
from
that
of
the
present
time
the
men
were
not
less
energetic
then
than
now
the
women
were
not
less
eager
the
children
were
quite
as
wild
and
mischievous
and
the
bustle
and
noise
apparently
if
not
really
as
great
what
interests
you
asked
charlie
tregarthen
observing
that
his
companion
gazed
pointedly
at
some
object
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
that
old
woman
said
oliver
see
how
demurely
she
sits
on
yonder
upturned
basket
knitting
with
all
her
might
in
the
midst
of
chaos
observed
tregarthen
laughing
and
she
looks
as
placidly
indifferent
to
the
noise
around
her
as
if
it
were
only
the
murmuring
of
a
summer
breeze
although
there
are
two
boys
yelling
at
her
very
ear
at
this
moment
perhaps
she
deaf
suggested
oliver
tregarthen
said
he
thought
this
highly
probable
and
the
two
remained
silent
for
some
time
watching
from
an
elevated
position
on
the
road
leading
down
to
the
sands
the
and
amusing
scene
below
talk
of
a
pantomime
indeed
no
christmas
pantomime
ever
got
up
in
the
great
metropolis
was
half
so
amusing
or
so
grand
as
that
summer
pantomime
that
was
performed
daily
on
newlyn
sands
with
admission
to
all
parts
of
the
house
the
stage
included
for
nothing
the
scenery
was
painted
with
gorgeous
splendour
by
nature
and
embraced
the
picturesque
village
of
newlyn
with
its
irregular
gables
variously
tinted
roofs
and
whitewashed
fronts
the
little
pier
with
its
modest
harbour
perfectly
dry
because
of
the
tide
being
out
but
which
even
if
the
tide
had
been
in
and
itself
full
to
overflowing
could
not
apparently
have
held
more
than
a
dozen
of
the
larger
the
calm
bay
crowded
with
boats
of
all
sizes
their
brown
and
yellow
sails
reflected
in
the
clear
water
and
each
boat
resting
on
its
own
image
on
the
horizon
might
be
seen
the
lizard
point
and
the
open
sea
over
which
hung
red
and
lurid
clouds
which
betokened
the
approach
of
a
storm
although
at
the
time
all
nature
was
quiet
and
peaceful
yes
the
scenery
was
admirably
painted
and
nothing
could
exceed
the
perfection
of
the
acting
it
was
so
true
to
nature
right
in
front
of
the
spot
where
the
two
friends
stood
a
fisherman
sat
astride
of
an
upturned
basket
enjoying
a
cup
of
tea
which
had
been
brought
to
him
by
a
little
girl
who
sat
on
another
upturned
basket
at
his
side
gazing
with
a
pleased
expression
into
his
rugged
countenance
one
cheek
of
which
was
distended
with
a
preposterously
large
bite
of
bread
and
butter
the
great
mathews
himself
never
acted
his
part
so
well
what
admirable
devotion
to
the
one
engrossing
object
in
hand
what
a
perfect
and
convincing
display
of
a
hearty
appetite
what
obvious
unconsciousness
of
being
looked
at
and
what
a
genuine
and
sudden
burst
of
indignation
when
owing
to
a
touch
of
carelessness
he
capsized
the
cup
and
poured
the
precious
tea
upon
the
thirsty
sand
at
the
distance
from
which
oliver
and
his
friend
observed
him
no
words
were
audible
but
none
were
necessary
the
man
acting
was
so
perfect
that
they
knew
he
was
scolding
the
little
girl
for
the
deed
which
he
himself
had
perpetrated
then
there
was
something
peculiarly
touching
in
the
way
in
which
he
suddenly
broke
into
a
short
laugh
and
patted
the
child
head
while
she
wiped
out
the
cup
and
refilled
it
from
the
little
brown
teapot
hitherto
concealed
under
her
ragged
shawl
to
keep
it
warm
no
wizard
was
needed
to
tell
however
that
this
was
quite
an
unnecessary
piece
of
carefulness
on
the
little
girl
part
for
any
brown
teapot
in
the
world
possessing
the
smallest
amount
of
feeling
would
have
instantly
made
hot
and
strong
tea
out
of
cold
water
on
being
pressed
against
the
bosom
of
that
sunny
child
just
beyond
this
couple
three
tired
men
in
blue
flannel
shirts
long
boots
and
grouped
themselves
round
a
bundle
of
straw
to
enjoy
a
pipe
one
stretched
himself
almost
at
full
length
on
it
in
lazy
nonchalance
another
sat
down
on
it
and
resting
his
elbows
on
his
knees
gazed
pensively
at
his
pipe
as
he
filled
it
while
the
third
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
stood
for
a
few
seconds
with
a
grand
bend
at
the
small
of
his
back
as
if
he
felt
that
his
muscles
worked
easily
and
gazed
out
to
sea
the
greatest
of
the
old
masters
could
have
painted
nothing
finer
away
to
the
right
an
old
man
might
be
seen
tying
up
the
lid
of
a
basket
full
of
fish
beside
his
cart
and
dividing
his
attention
between
the
basket
and
the
horse
which
latter
much
to
his
surprise
was
unwontedly
restive
that
evening
and
required
an
unusual
number
of
cautions
to
remain
still
and
of
threats
as
to
the
punishment
that
would
follow
continued
disobedience
all
of
which
afforded
the
most
intense
and
unutterable
delight
to
a
very
small
precocious
boy
who
standing
concealed
on
the
off
side
of
the
animal
tickled
its
ear
with
a
straw
every
time
it
bent
its
head
towards
the
bundle
of
hay
which
lay
at
its
feet
no
clown
or
pantaloon
was
there
to
inflict
condign
punishment
because
none
was
needed
a
brother
carter
standing
by
performed
the
part
extempore
his
eye
suddenly
lit
on
the
culprit
his
whip
sprang
into
the
air
and
descended
on
the
urchin
breech
his
mouth
opened
responsive
to
the
crack
and
a
yell
came
forth
that
rose
high
above
the
surrounding
din
while
his
little
legs
carried
him
away
over
the
sands
like
a
ragged
leaf
driven
before
the
wind
to
the
left
of
this
scene
and
ignorant
of
it
for
the
stage
was
so
large
the
actors
were
so
numerous
and
the
play
so
grand
that
few
could
do
more
than
attend
to
their
own
part
a
cripple
might
be
seen
with
a
crutch
hopping
actively
about
he
was
a
young
man
had
lost
his
leg
by
an
accident
probably
and
was
looking
about
for
a
fish
for
his
own
supper
he
soon
found
one
whether
it
was
that
one
had
been
dropped
accidentally
or
that
some
had
dropped
one
on
purpose
we
can
not
tell
but
he
did
get
one
a
large
fat
one
too
and
hobbled
away
as
quickly
as
he
could
evidently
rejoicing
the
cripple
was
not
the
only
one
who
crossed
the
stage
thus
lightly
burdened
there
were
several
halt
and
maimed
and
some
blind
and
aged
ones
there
whose
desires
in
regard
to
piscatorial
wealth
extended
only
to
one
or
perhaps
two
and
they
all
got
what
they
wanted
that
was
sufficient
for
the
evening
supper
for
the
morrow
there
was
no
need
to
care
they
could
return
to
get
a
fresh
supply
evening
after
evening
for
many
a
day
to
come
for
it
was
a
splendid
mackerel
season
such
as
had
not
been
for
many
years
so
said
the
sages
of
the
village
there
were
other
groups
and
other
incidents
that
would
have
drawn
laughter
as
well
as
tears
from
sympathetic
hearts
but
we
must
forbear
the
play
was
long
of
being
acted
out
it
was
no
common
play
besides
it
is
time
for
actors
to
come
upon
the
stage
themselves
i
see
old
hitchin
exclaimed
oliver
trembath
starting
suddenly
out
of
a
reverie
and
pointing
into
the
thickest
of
the
crowd
how
can
you
tell
you
do
know
him
said
his
companion
know
him
of
course
i
do
who
could
fail
to
know
him
after
the
graphic
description
the
lawyer
gave
of
him
see
look
yonder
beside
the
cart
with
the
big
man
in
it
arranging
baskets
see
which
the
one
painted
green
and
a
scraggy
horse
with
a
bag
hanging
to
its
nose
no
no
a
little
further
to
the
left
man
the
one
with
the
broken
rail
and
the
horse
there
there
he
is
a
thin
wrinkled
old
shabby
ah
that
the
man
exclaimed
tregarthen
laughing
come
along
and
let
try
to
keep
our
eyes
on
him
for
there
is
nothing
so
difficult
as
finding
any
one
in
a
crowd
the
difficulty
referred
to
was
speedily
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
the
two
friends
threaded
their
way
to
the
spot
where
the
cart
had
stood
and
found
not
only
that
it
was
gone
but
that
hitchin
had
also
moved
away
and
although
they
pushed
through
the
crowd
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
failed
to
find
him
as
they
were
wandering
about
thus
they
observed
a
very
tall
man
talking
earnestly
in
undertones
to
a
fellow
who
was
still
broader
across
the
shoulders
but
not
quite
so
tall
it
is
probable
that
oliver
would
have
paid
no
attention
to
them
had
not
the
name
of
hitchin
struck
his
ear
glancing
round
at
the
men
he
observed
that
the
taller
of
the
two
was
joe
tonkin
and
the
other
his
friend
of
the
land
end
the
famous
jim
cuttance
oliver
plucked
his
companion
by
the
sleeve
and
whispered
him
to
stand
still
only
a
few
words
and
phrases
reached
them
but
these
were
sufficient
to
create
surprise
and
arouse
suspicion
once
in
particular
tonkin
who
appeared
to
be
losing
his
temper
raised
his
voice
a
little
exclaiming
i
tell
what
it
is
cuttance
i
do
knaw
what
you
up
to
an
i
hinder
ef
i
can
the
man
confirmed
this
statement
with
a
savage
oath
to
which
cuttance
replied
in
kind
nevertheless
he
was
evidently
anxious
to
conciliate
his
companion
and
spoke
so
low
as
to
be
nearly
inaudible
only
the
words
not
i
wo
do
it
reached
the
ears
of
the
listeners
at
this
point
tonkin
turned
from
the
smuggler
with
a
fling
muttering
in
an
undertone
as
he
went
i
do
cuttance
for
a
liard
so
i
watch
booy
oliver
was
about
to
follow
tonkin
when
he
observed
hitchin
himself
slowly
wending
his
way
through
the
crowd
he
had
evidently
heard
nothing
of
the
conversation
that
appeared
to
have
reference
to
himself
for
he
sauntered
along
with
a
careless
air
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
as
though
he
were
an
uninterested
spectator
of
the
busy
scene
oliver
at
once
accosted
him
pray
sir
is
your
name
hitchin
it
is
replied
the
old
man
eyeing
his
interrogator
suspiciously
allow
me
to
introduce
myself
sir
oliver
trembath
nephew
to
mr
thomas
donnithorne
of
st
just
mr
hitchin
held
out
his
hand
and
said
that
he
was
happy
to
meet
with
a
nephew
of
his
old
friend
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
would
much
rather
not
meet
either
nephew
or
uncle
oliver
felt
this
so
he
put
on
his
most
insinuating
air
and
requested
mr
hitchin
to
walk
with
him
a
little
aside
from
the
crowd
as
he
had
something
of
a
private
nature
to
say
to
him
the
old
man
agreed
and
the
two
walked
slowly
along
the
sands
to
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
where
young
tregarthen
discreetly
left
them
the
moment
oliver
broached
the
subject
of
the
advance
of
money
hitchin
frowned
and
the
colour
in
his
face
betrayed
suppressed
anger
sir
said
he
i
know
all
that
you
would
say
to
me
it
has
already
been
said
oftener
than
there
is
any
occasion
for
no
one
appears
to
believe
me
when
i
assert
that
i
have
met
with
heavy
losses
of
late
and
have
no
cash
to
spare
not
even
enough
to
pay
my
debts
indeed
sir
replied
oliver
i
regret
to
hear
you
say
so
and
i
can
only
apologise
for
having
troubled
you
on
the
subject
i
assure
you
nothing
would
have
induced
me
to
do
so
but
regard
for
my
uncle
to
whom
the
continuance
of
this
mine
for
some
time
would
appear
to
be
a
matter
of
considerable
importance
but
since
you
will
not
not
interrupted
hitchin
angrily
have
i
not
said
i
tell
you
young
man
that
there
is
a
scoundrel
to
whom
i
owe
a
large
sum
for
for
well
no
matter
what
it
for
but
the
blackguard
threatens
that
if
i
do
pshaw
the
old
man
seemed
unable
to
contain
himself
at
this
point
for
he
turned
angrily
away
from
oliver
and
hastening
back
towards
the
town
was
soon
lost
again
in
the
crowd
oliver
was
so
taken
by
surprise
that
he
stood
still
gazing
dreamily
at
the
point
where
hitchin
had
disappeared
until
he
was
roused
by
a
touch
on
the
shoulder
from
charlie
tregarthen
well
said
he
smiling
how
fares
your
suit
oliver
replied
by
a
burst
of
laughter
how
fares
my
suit
he
repeated
badly
very
badly
indeed
why
the
old
fellow
monkey
got
up
the
moment
i
broached
the
subject
and
i
was
just
in
the
middle
of
what
i
meant
to
be
a
most
conciliating
speech
when
he
flung
off
as
you
have
seen
odd
very
odd
said
tregarthen
to
see
how
some
men
cling
to
their
money
as
if
it
were
their
life
after
all
it
life
to
some
at
least
all
the
life
they
have
got
come
now
do
moralise
charlie
for
we
must
act
just
now
i
ready
to
act
in
any
way
you
propose
oliver
what
do
you
intend
to
do
issue
your
commands
and
i
obey
shall
we
attack
the
village
of
newlyn
and
set
fire
to
it
as
did
the
spaniards
of
old
or
shall
we
swim
off
to
the
fleet
of
boats
cut
the
cables
bind
the
men
in
charge
and
set
sail
for
the
mackerel
fishing
neither
my
chum
and
especially
not
the
latter
seeing
that
a
thundercloud
is
about
to
break
over
the
sea
ere
long
if
i
do
not
greatly
misjudge
appearances
in
the
sky
but
man
we
must
see
this
testy
old
fellow
again
and
warn
him
of
the
danger
which
threatens
him
i
feel
assured
that
that
rascal
cuttance
means
him
harm
for
he
let
something
fall
in
his
anger
which
coupled
with
what
we
have
already
heard
from
the
smuggler
himself
and
from
tonkin
convinces
me
that
evil
is
in
the
wind
now
the
question
is
how
are
we
to
find
him
for
searching
in
that
crowd
is
almost
useless
let
us
go
to
his
house
suggested
tregarthen
and
if
he
is
not
at
home
wait
for
him
do
you
know
where
his
house
is
no
not
i
then
we
must
inquire
so
come
along
pushing
once
more
through
the
throng
of
busy
men
and
women
the
friends
ascended
the
sloping
causeway
that
led
to
the
village
and
here
asked
the
first
man
they
met
where
mr
hitchin
lived
right
over
top
o
hill
replied
the
man
thank
you
that
do
charlie
come
along
said
oliver
turning
into
one
of
the
narrow
passages
that
diverged
from
the
main
street
of
newlyn
and
ascending
the
hill
with
giant
strides
one
should
never
be
particular
in
their
inquiries
after
a
place
when
i
told
to
turn
to
the
right
after
the
second
turning
to
the
left
and
that
if
i
go
right
on
till
i
come
to
some
other
turning
that
will
conduct
me
point
blank
to
the
street
that
enters
the
square
near
to
which
lies
the
spot
i
wish
to
reach
i
apt
to
get
confused
get
a
general
direction
if
possible
the
position
indicated
by
compass
is
almost
enough
and
that
my
plan
and
i
never
found
it
fail
chapter
twenty
three
in
which
is
recorded
a
visit
to
an
a
warning
to
a
thankless
old
gentleman
also
a
storm
and
a
sudden
as
well
as
surprising
end
of
a
mine
besides
dark
designs
oliver
trembath
plan
of
asking
again
had
to
be
put
in
practice
sooner
than
had
been
anticipated
for
the
back
alleys
and
lanes
of
newlyn
were
a
little
perplexing
to
a
stranger
let
us
inquire
here
said
tregarthen
seeing
the
door
of
a
very
small
cottage
with
part
of
a
woman
back
visible
in
the
interior
by
all
means
said
oliver
pushing
open
the
door
and
stooping
low
as
he
entered
the
visitors
were
instantly
transfixed
by
thirty
pair
of
eyes
all
of
them
bright
blue
or
bright
black
few
of
them
elevated
much
more
than
two
feet
from
the
ground
and
not
one
of
them
dimmed
by
the
smallest
approach
to
a
wink
nay
on
the
contrary
they
all
opened
so
wide
when
the
strangers
entered
that
it
seemed
as
if
either
winking
or
shutting
were
in
future
out
of
the
question
and
that
to
sleep
with
eyes
wide
open
was
the
sad
prospect
of
the
owners
thereof
in
all
time
coming
an
murmured
tregarthen
the
very
smallest
boy
in
the
school
an
infant
with
legs
about
five
inches
long
who
sat
on
a
stool
not
more
than
three
inches
high
appeared
to
understand
what
he
said
and
to
regard
it
as
a
personal
insult
for
he
at
once
began
to
cry
a
little
girl
with
bright
red
hair
a
lovely
complexion
and
a
body
so
small
as
to
be
scarce
worth
mentioning
immediately
embraced
the
small
boy
whereupon
he
dried
his
eyes
without
delay
you
have
a
nice
little
school
here
said
oliver
iss
sur
we
do
feel
proud
of
it
said
the
motherly
dame
in
charge
with
a
little
twitch
of
her
shoulders
which
revealed
the
horrible
fact
that
both
her
arms
had
been
taken
off
above
the
elbows
the
are
very
good
and
they
do
sing
bootiful
now
then
let
the
gentlemen
hear
you
that
be
come
instantly
and
in
every
possible
pitch
the
thirty
mouths
belonging
to
the
thirty
pair
of
eyes
opened
and
o
that
will
be
joyful
etcetera
burst
forth
with
thrilling
power
a
few
leading
voices
gradually
turned
the
torrent
into
a
united
channel
and
before
the
second
verse
was
reached
the
hymn
was
tunefully
sung
the
sweet
voice
of
the
little
girl
with
the
bright
hair
being
particularly
distinguishable
and
the
shrill
pipe
of
the
smallest
boy
sounding
high
above
the
rest
as
he
sang
o
that
will
be
doyful
doyful
doyful
doyful
with
all
his
might
and
main
when
this
was
finished
tregarthen
asked
the
schoolmistress
what
misfortune
had
caused
the
loss
of
her
arms
to
which
she
replied
that
she
had
lost
them
in
a
coach
accident
as
she
was
beginning
to
relate
the
history
of
this
sad
affair
oliver
broke
in
with
a
question
as
to
where
old
mr
hitchin
house
was
being
directed
to
it
they
took
leave
of
the
and
soon
found
themselves
before
the
door
of
a
small
cottage
they
were
at
once
admitted
to
the
presence
of
the
testy
old
hitchin
who
chanced
to
be
smoking
a
pipe
at
the
time
he
did
not
by
any
means
bestow
a
welcome
look
on
his
visitors
but
oliver
nevertheless
advanced
and
sat
down
in
a
chair
before
him
i
have
called
mr
hitchin
he
began
not
to
trouble
you
about
the
matter
which
displeased
you
when
we
conversed
together
on
the
beach
but
to
warn
you
of
a
danger
which
i
fear
threatens
yourself
what
danger
may
that
be
inquired
hitchin
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
held
all
danger
in
contempt
what
it
is
i
can
not
tell
but
can
not
tell
interrupted
the
old
man
then
what
the
use
of
troubling
me
about
it
neither
can
i
tell
of
what
use
my
troubling
you
may
be
retorted
oliver
with
provoking
coolness
but
i
heard
the
man
speak
of
you
on
the
beach
less
than
an
hour
ago
and
as
you
referred
to
him
yourself
i
thought
it
right
to
call
at
this
point
hitchin
again
broke
in
heard
a
man
speak
of
me
what
man
really
mr
trembath
your
conduct
appears
strange
to
me
will
you
explain
yourself
certainly
i
was
going
to
have
added
if
your
irascible
temper
would
have
allowed
me
that
the
notorious
smuggler
jim
cuttance
oliver
stopped
for
at
the
mention
of
the
smuggler
name
the
pipe
dropped
from
the
old
man
mouth
and
his
face
grew
pale
jim
cuttance
he
exclaimed
after
a
moment
pause
the
villain
the
scoundrel
what
of
him
what
of
him
no
good
i
warrant
there
is
not
a
rogue
unhanged
who
deserves
more
richly
to
swing
at
the
than
jim
cuttance
what
said
he
about
me
when
he
finished
this
sentence
the
old
man
composure
was
somewhat
restored
he
took
a
new
pipe
from
the
and
began
to
fill
it
while
oliver
related
all
that
he
knew
of
the
conversation
between
the
two
smugglers
when
he
had
finished
hitchin
smoked
for
some
minutes
in
silence
do
you
really
think
he
said
at
length
that
the
man
means
to
do
me
bodily
harm
i
can
not
tell
replied
oliver
you
can
form
your
own
judgment
of
the
matter
more
correctly
than
i
can
but
i
would
advise
you
to
be
on
your
guard
what
says
your
friend
asked
hitchin
turning
towards
tregarthen
of
whom
up
to
that
point
he
had
taken
no
notice
thus
appealed
to
the
youth
echoed
oliver
opinion
and
added
that
the
remark
of
cuttance
about
his
intention
not
to
do
something
unknown
night
and
joe
tonkin
muttered
expressions
of
disbelief
and
an
intention
to
watch
seemed
to
him
sufficient
to
warrant
unusual
caution
in
the
matter
of
locks
bolts
and
bars
as
he
spoke
there
came
a
blinding
flash
of
lightning
followed
by
a
loud
and
prolonged
peal
of
thunder
oliver
sprang
up
we
must
bid
you
he
said
for
we
have
to
walk
to
just
and
do
wish
to
get
more
of
the
storm
than
we
can
avoid
but
you
can
not
escape
it
said
hitchin
nevertheless
we
can
go
as
far
as
possible
before
it
begins
and
then
take
shelter
under
a
bush
or
hedge
or
in
a
house
if
we
chance
to
be
near
one
i
would
rather
talk
in
rain
any
day
than
drive
in
a
kittereen
pray
be
persuaded
to
stop
where
you
are
gentlemen
said
the
old
man
in
a
tone
of
voice
that
was
marvellously
altered
for
the
better
i
can
offer
you
comfortable
quarters
for
the
night
and
good
though
plain
fare
with
smuggled
brandy
of
the
best
and
tobacco
to
match
still
oliver
and
tregarthen
persisted
in
their
resolution
to
leave
until
hitchin
began
to
plead
in
a
tone
that
showed
he
was
anxious
to
have
their
presence
in
the
house
as
protectors
then
their
resolution
began
to
waver
and
when
the
old
man
hinted
that
they
might
thus
find
time
to
reconsider
the
matter
of
the
wherry
mine
they
finally
gave
in
and
made
up
their
minds
to
stay
all
night
according
to
the
opinion
of
a
celebrated
poet
the
plans
of
men
as
well
as
mice
are
apt
to
miscarry
that
night
the
elements
contrived
to
throw
men
calculations
out
of
joint
and
to
render
their
cupidity
villainy
and
wisdom
alike
ineffectual
a
storm
the
fiercest
that
had
visited
them
for
many
years
burst
that
night
on
the
southern
shores
of
england
and
strewed
her
rocks
and
sands
with
wrecks
and
dead
bodies
nothing
new
in
this
alas
as
all
know
who
dwell
upon
our
shores
or
who
take
an
interest
in
and
read
the
records
of
our
royal
and
noble
lifeboat
institution
but
with
this
great
subject
we
have
not
to
do
just
now
further
than
to
observe
as
we
have
said
before
that
in
those
days
there
were
no
lifeboats
on
the
coast
under
the
shelter
of
an
old
house
on
the
shore
at
penzance
were
gathered
together
a
huge
concourse
of
townspeople
and
seafaring
men
watching
the
storm
it
was
a
grand
and
awful
sight
one
fitted
to
irresistibly
solemnise
the
mind
and
incline
it
unless
the
heart
be
utterly
hardened
to
think
of
the
great
creator
and
of
the
unseen
world
which
seems
at
such
a
season
to
be
brought
impressively
near
the
night
was
extremely
dark
and
the
lightning
by
contrast
peculiarly
vivid
each
flash
appeared
to
fill
the
world
for
a
moment
with
lambent
fire
leaving
the
painful
impression
on
observers
of
having
been
struck
with
total
blindness
for
a
few
seconds
after
and
each
thunderclap
came
like
the
bursting
of
artillery
with
scarcely
an
interval
between
the
flash
and
crash
while
the
wind
blew
with
almost
tropical
fury
the
terrible
turmoil
and
noise
were
enhanced
tenfold
by
the
raging
surf
which
flew
up
over
the
roadway
and
sent
the
spray
high
above
and
beyond
the
tops
of
the
houses
nearest
to
the
shore
the
old
house
creaked
and
groaned
in
the
blast
as
if
it
would
come
down
and
the
men
taking
shelter
there
looked
out
to
sea
in
silence
the
bronzed
veterans
there
knew
full
well
that
at
that
hour
many
a
despairing
cry
was
being
uttered
many
a
hand
was
stretched
wildly
helplessly
and
hopelessly
from
the
midst
of
the
boiling
surf
and
many
a
soul
was
passing
into
eternity
they
would
have
been
ready
then
as
well
as
now
to
have
risked
life
and
limb
to
save
from
the
sea
but
ordinary
boats
they
knew
could
not
live
in
such
a
storm
among
the
watchers
there
stood
jim
cuttance
he
had
been
drinking
at
a
in
penzance
and
was
at
the
time
to
use
his
own
expression
three
sheets
in
the
wind
that
is
about
what
his
business
was
nobody
knew
and
we
shall
not
inquire
but
he
was
the
first
to
express
his
belief
that
the
turret
and
bridge
of
the
wherry
mine
would
give
way
as
he
spoke
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
revealed
the
stout
timbers
of
the
mine
standing
bravely
in
the
storm
each
beam
and
chain
painted
black
and
sharp
against
the
illumined
sky
and
the
foaming
sea
she
have
stud
out
many
a
gale
observed
a
old
seaman
she
wo
go
down
yet
i
do
hope
she
wo
observed
another
she
have
got
a
chance
said
cuttance
just
then
another
flash
came
and
there
arose
a
sharp
cry
of
alarm
from
the
crowd
for
a
ship
was
seen
driving
before
the
gale
close
in
upon
the
land
so
close
that
she
seemed
to
have
risen
there
by
magic
and
appeared
to
tower
almost
over
the
heads
of
the
people
the
moments
of
darkness
that
succeeded
were
spent
in
breathless
intense
anxiety
the
flashes
which
had
been
fast
enough
before
seemed
to
have
ceased
altogether
now
but
again
the
lightning
gleamed
bright
as
full
moonlight
and
again
the
ship
was
seen
nearer
than
before
close
on
the
bridge
of
the
mine
is
the
yankee
ship
broken
from
her
anchors
in
gwavus
lake
exclaimed
a
voice
the
that
followed
was
succeeded
by
a
crash
of
rending
timber
and
flying
bolts
that
almost
emulated
the
thunder
certainly
it
told
with
greater
power
on
the
nerves
of
those
who
heard
it
once
again
the
lightning
flashed
and
for
a
moment
the
american
vessel
was
seen
driving
away
before
the
wind
but
no
vestige
of
wherry
mine
remained
the
bridge
and
all
connected
with
it
had
been
completely
carried
away
and
its
shattered
remnants
were
engulfed
in
the
foaming
sea
it
deserved
a
better
fate
but
its
course
was
run
and
its
hour
had
come
it
passed
away
that
stormy
night
and
now
nothing
remains
but
a
few
indications
of
its
visible
at
low
water
to
tell
of
one
of
the
boldest
and
most
singular
of
mining
enterprises
ever
undertaken
and
carried
out
by
man
there
was
one
spectator
of
this
imposing
scene
who
was
not
very
deeply
impressed
by
it
jim
cuttance
cared
not
a
straw
for
storms
or
wrecks
so
long
as
he
himself
was
safe
from
their
influence
besides
he
had
other
work
in
hand
that
night
so
he
left
the
watchers
on
the
beach
soon
after
the
destruction
of
the
bridge
buttoning
his
coat
up
to
the
neck
and
pulling
his
tight
over
his
brows
he
walked
smartly
along
the
road
to
newlyn
while
many
of
the
fishermen
ran
down
to
the
beach
to
render
help
to
the
vessel
between
the
town
of
penzance
and
the
village
of
newlyn
several
old
boats
lay
on
the
grass
above
mark
here
the
smuggler
stopped
and
gave
a
loud
whistle
he
listened
a
moment
and
than
repeated
it
still
louder
he
was
answered
by
a
similar
signal
and
four
men
in
garb
issuing
from
behind
one
of
the
boats
advanced
to
meet
him
all
right
bill
inquired
cuttance
all
right
sur
was
the
reply
did
i
tell
to
leave
them
things
behind
said
cuttance
sternly
as
he
pointed
to
the
butt
of
a
pistol
which
protruded
from
the
of
one
of
the
men
sure
we
do
require
powder
and
lead
to
overcome
an
old
man
no
more
do
we
need
a
party
o
five
to
do
it
replied
the
man
doggedly
to
this
cuttance
vouchsafed
no
reply
but
plucking
the
weapon
from
the
man
he
tossed
it
far
into
the
sea
and
without
further
remark
walked
towards
the
fishing
village
followed
by
his
men
by
this
time
the
thunder
and
rain
had
abated
considerably
but
the
gale
blew
with
increased
violence
and
as
there
were
neither
moon
nor
stars
the
darkness
was
so
intense
that
men
less
acquainted
with
the
locality
would
have
been
obliged
to
proceed
with
caution
but
the
smugglers
knew
every
foot
of
the
ground
between
the
lizard
and
the
land
end
and
they
advanced
with
rapid
strides
until
they
reached
the
low
wall
that
encompassed
but
could
not
be
said
to
guard
old
mr
the
hour
was
suited
for
deeds
of
darkness
being
a
little
after
midnight
and
the
noise
of
the
gale
favoured
the
burglars
who
leaped
the
wall
with
ease
and
approached
the
back
of
the
cottage
in
ordinary
circumstances
hitchin
would
have
been
in
bed
and
cuttance
knew
his
habits
sufficiently
to
be
aware
of
this
his
surprise
therefore
was
great
when
he
found
lights
burning
and
greater
still
when
peeping
through
a
chink
of
the
he
observed
two
stout
fellows
seated
at
the
old
man
table
charles
tregarthen
he
had
never
seen
before
and
as
oliver
trembath
sat
with
his
back
to
the
window
he
could
not
recognise
him
there
company
wi
the
owld
man
said
cuttance
returning
to
his
comrades
two
men
young
and
stout
but
we
do
knaw
how
to
manage
they
this
was
said
by
way
of
an
appeal
and
was
received
with
a
grin
by
the
others
and
a
brief
recommendation
to
go
to
work
without
delay
for
a
few
minutes
they
whispered
together
as
to
the
plan
of
attack
and
then
having
agreed
on
that
point
they
separated
cuttance
and
the
man
whom
he
had
called
bill
went
to
the
window
of
the
room
in
which
hitchin
and
his
guests
were
seated
and
stationed
themselves
on
either
side
of
it
the
sill
was
not
more
than
breast
high
the
other
three
men
quickly
returned
bearing
a
heavy
which
they
meant
to
use
as
a
it
had
been
arranged
that
cuttance
should
throw
up
the
window
and
at
the
same
moment
his
comrades
should
rush
at
the
shutter
with
the
mast
the
leader
could
not
see
their
faces
but
there
was
light
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
distinguish
their
dark
forms
standing
in
the
attitude
of
readiness
he
therefore
stepped
forward
and
made
a
powerful
effort
to
force
up
the
window
but
it
resisted
him
although
it
shook
violently
those
inside
sprang
up
at
the
sound
and
the
smugglers
sank
down
as
if
by
mutual
consent
among
the
bushes
which
grew
thickly
near
the
window
i
told
you
it
was
only
the
wind
said
oliver
trembath
who
had
opened
the
shutter
and
gazed
through
the
window
for
some
time
into
the
darkness
where
of
course
he
saw
nothing
well
was
it
for
him
that
cuttance
refused
to
follow
bill
advice
which
was
to
charge
him
through
the
window
with
the
mast
the
former
knew
that
with
the
window
fastened
it
would
be
impossible
to
force
an
entrance
in
the
face
of
such
a
youth
as
tregarthen
even
although
they
succeeded
in
rendering
the
other
de
so
he
restrained
bill
and
awaited
his
opportunity
oliver
remark
appeared
to
be
corroborated
by
a
gust
of
wind
which
came
while
he
was
speaking
and
shook
the
violently
there
it
is
again
he
said
turning
to
his
host
with
a
smile
depend
upon
it
they
wo
trouble
you
on
such
a
night
as
this
he
closed
and
refastened
the
shutter
as
he
spoke
and
they
all
returned
to
their
places
at
the
table
unfortunately
oliver
had
not
thought
of
examining
the
fastening
of
the
window
itself
had
he
done
so
he
would
have
seen
that
it
was
almost
wrenched
away
cuttance
saw
this
however
and
resolved
to
make
sure
work
of
it
next
time
when
the
men
with
the
were
again
in
position
he
and
bill
applied
their
united
strength
to
the
window
and
it
instantly
flew
up
to
the
top
at
same
moment
bolts
and
bars
gave
way
and
the
shutter
went
in
with
a
crash
making
use
of
the
mast
as
a
rest
cuttance
sprang
on
the
and
leaped
into
the
room
the
whole
thing
was
done
with
such
speed
and
if
we
may
so
express
it
with
such
simultaneity
of
action
that
the
bold
smuggler
stood
before
the
astonished
inmates
almost
as
soon
as
they
could
leap
from
their
chairs
cuttance
ducked
to
evade
a
terrific
blow
which
oliver
aimed
at
him
with
his
fist
and
in
another
instant
grappled
with
him
tregarthen
rushed
to
the
window
in
time
to
meet
bill
on
whose
forehead
he
planted
a
blow
so
effectual
that
that
worthy
fell
back
into
the
arms
of
his
friends
who
considerately
let
him
drop
to
the
ground
and
made
a
united
assault
on
charlie
had
oliver
trembath
possessed
his
wonted
vigour
he
would
speedily
have
overcome
his
adversary
despite
his
great
strength
but
his
recent
illness
had
weakened
him
a
little
so
that
the
two
were
pretty
equally
matched
the
consequence
was
that
neither
daring
to
loosen
his
hold
in
order
to
strike
an
effective
blow
each
had
to
devote
all
his
energies
to
throw
the
other
in
which
effort
they
wrenched
thrust
and
swung
each
other
so
violently
round
the
room
that
chairs
and
tables
were
overturned
and
smashed
and
poor
old
hitchin
had
enough
to
do
to
avoid
being
floored
in
the
and
to
preserve
from
destruction
the
candle
which
lighted
the
scene
of
the
combat
at
first
oliver
had
tried
to
free
his
right
hand
in
order
to
strike
but
finding
this
impossible
he
attempted
to
throw
the
smuggler
and
with
this
end
in
view
lifted
him
bodily
in
the
air
and
dashed
him
down
but
cuttance
managed
to
throw
out
a
leg
and
meet
the
ground
with
his
foot
which
saved
him
he
was
a
noted
wrestler
he
could
give
the
famous
cornish
hug
with
the
fervour
of
a
black
bear
and
knew
all
the
mysteries
of
the
science
often
had
he
displayed
his
great
muscular
power
and
skill
in
the
ring
where
wrestlers
were
wont
to
engage
in
those
combats
of
which
the
poet
writes
they
rush
impetuous
with
a
shock
their
arms
implicit
rigid
lock
they
twist
they
trip
their
limbs
are
mixed
as
one
they
move
as
one
stand
fixed
now
plant
their
feet
in
wider
space
and
stand
like
statues
on
their
base
but
never
before
had
jim
cuttance
had
to
deal
with
such
a
man
as
oliver
trembath
who
swung
him
about
among
the
chairs
and
crashed
him
through
the
tables
until
seizing
a
sudden
opportunity
he
succeeded
in
flinging
him
flat
on
the
floor
where
he
held
him
down
and
planted
his
knee
on
his
chest
with
such
force
that
he
nearly
squeezed
all
the
breath
out
of
him
no
word
did
jim
cuttance
utter
for
he
was
incapable
of
speech
but
the
colour
of
his
face
and
his
protruding
tongue
induced
oliver
to
remove
his
knee
meanwhile
charlie
tregarthen
had
enough
to
do
at
the
window
after
he
had
tumbled
bill
out
as
we
have
described
two
of
the
other
men
sprang
at
him
and
seizing
him
by
the
collar
of
his
coat
attempted
to
drag
him
out
one
of
these
he
succeeded
in
overthrowing
by
a
kick
on
the
chest
but
his
place
was
instantly
taken
by
the
third
of
the
bearers
of
the
and
for
a
few
minutes
the
struggle
was
fierce
but
undecided
suddenly
there
arose
a
great
shout
and
all
three
tumbled
head
over
heels
into
the
shrubbery
it
was
at
this
moment
that
oliver
rose
from
his
prostrate
foe
he
at
once
sprang
to
the
rescue
leaped
out
of
the
window
and
was
in
the
act
of
launching
a
blow
at
the
head
of
the
first
man
he
encountered
when
a
voice
shouted
hold
on
sur
it
is
certain
that
oliver
would
have
declined
to
hold
on
had
not
the
voice
sounded
familiar
he
held
his
hand
and
next
moment
charlie
appeared
in
the
light
of
the
window
dragging
a
struggling
man
after
him
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
at
the
same
time
joe
tonkin
came
forward
trailing
another
man
by
the
hair
of
the
head
has
cuttance
got
off
inquired
tonkin
no
replied
oliver
leaping
back
into
the
room
just
in
time
to
prevent
jim
who
had
recovered
from
making
his
escape
now
my
man
keep
quiet
said
oliver
thrusting
him
down
into
a
chair
you
and
i
have
met
before
and
you
know
that
it
is
useless
to
attempt
resistance
cuttance
vouchsafed
no
reply
but
sat
still
with
a
dogged
expression
on
his
visage
hitchin
whose
nerves
were
much
shaken
by
the
scene
of
which
he
had
been
a
trembling
spectator
soon
produced
ropes
with
which
the
prisoners
were
bound
and
then
they
were
conducted
to
a
place
of
safe
keeping
each
of
the
victors
leading
the
man
he
had
secured
and
old
hitchin
going
before
an
excited
the
two
men
whom
tregarthen
knocked
down
had
recovered
and
made
their
escape
just
before
the
fight
closed
oliver
trembath
walked
first
in
the
procession
leading
jim
cuttance
i
gave
you
credit
for
a
more
manly
spirit
than
this
said
oliver
as
he
walked
along
how
could
you
make
so
cowardly
an
attack
on
an
old
man
cuttance
made
no
reply
and
oliver
felt
sorry
that
he
had
spoken
for
the
remembrance
of
the
incident
at
the
land
end
was
strong
upon
him
and
he
would
have
given
all
he
possessed
to
have
had
no
hand
in
delivering
the
smuggler
up
to
justice
at
the
same
time
he
felt
that
the
attempt
of
cuttance
was
a
dastardly
one
and
that
duty
required
him
to
act
as
he
did
it
seemed
to
oliver
as
if
joe
tonkin
had
divined
his
thoughts
for
at
that
moment
he
pushed
close
to
him
and
whispered
in
his
ear
jim
cuttance
did
mean
to
rob
th
owld
man
sur
he
only
wanted
to
give
he
a
fright
an
make
un
pay
what
he
did
owe
un
this
was
a
new
light
on
the
subject
to
oliver
who
at
once
formed
his
resolution
and
acted
on
it
cuttance
he
said
it
is
not
unlikely
that
if
brought
to
justice
you
will
swing
for
this
night
adventure
he
paused
and
glanced
at
the
face
of
his
prisoner
who
still
maintained
rigid
silence
well
continued
our
hero
i
believe
that
your
intentions
against
mr
hitchin
were
not
so
bad
as
they
would
appear
to
be
who
told
that
asked
the
smuggler
sternly
no
matter
replied
oliver
drawing
a
knife
from
his
pocket
with
which
he
deliberately
cut
the
cords
that
bound
his
prisoner
there
you
are
free
i
hope
that
you
will
make
better
use
of
your
freedom
in
time
to
come
than
you
have
in
time
past
although
i
doubt
it
much
but
remember
that
i
have
repaid
the
debt
i
owe
you
nay
replied
cuttance
still
continuing
to
walk
close
to
his
companion
side
i
did
give
you
life
you
have
but
given
me
liberty
i
advise
you
to
take
advantage
of
that
liberty
without
delay
said
oliver
somewhat
nettled
by
the
man
remark
as
well
as
by
his
cool
composure
else
your
liberty
may
be
again
taken
from
you
in
which
case
i
would
not
give
much
for
your
life
if
you
do
not
assist
there
is
no
one
here
who
can
take
me
replied
cuttance
with
a
smile
however
i
not
ungrateful
as
he
said
this
the
smuggler
turned
sharp
to
the
right
into
one
of
the
numerous
narrow
passages
which
divide
the
dwellings
of
newlyn
and
disappeared
charles
tregarthen
who
was
as
sharp
as
a
needle
observed
this
and
leaving
his
man
in
charge
of
tonkin
darted
after
the
fugitive
he
soon
returned
however
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
and
declaring
that
he
had
lost
himself
in
his
vain
endeavours
to
find
the
smuggler
how
in
all
the
world
did
you
manage
to
let
him
go
he
demanded
somewhat
sharply
of
oliver
why
charlie
replied
his
friend
with
a
laugh
you
know
i
have
not
been
trained
to
the
duties
of
a
policeman
and
it
has
always
been
said
that
jim
cuttance
was
a
slippery
eel
however
he
gone
now
so
we
had
better
have
the
others
placed
in
safe
custody
as
soon
as
possible
saying
this
he
passed
his
arm
through
that
of
old
mr
hitchin
and
soon
after
the
smugglers
were
duly
incarcerated
in
the
of
penzance
chapter
twenty
four
exhibits
the
managing
director
and
the
secretary
of
wheal
dooem
in
confidential
circumstances
and
introduces
the
subject
of
locals
about
this
time
that
energetic
promoter
of
mining
operations
mr
george
augustus
clearemout
found
it
necessary
to
revisit
cornwall
he
was
seated
in
an
in
a
snug
little
or
in
one
of
the
airiest
little
streets
of
the
city
of
london
when
this
necessity
became
apparent
to
him
mr
clearemout
did
not
appear
to
have
much
to
do
at
that
particular
time
for
he
contented
himself
with
tapping
the
arm
of
his
with
the
knuckles
of
his
right
hand
while
he
twirled
his
gold
with
his
left
and
smiled
occasionally
to
judge
from
appearances
it
seemed
that
things
in
general
were
prospering
with
george
augustus
everything
about
him
was
new
and
we
might
almost
say
gorgeous
his
coat
and
vest
and
pantaloons
had
a
look
and
a
cut
about
them
that
told
of
an
extremely
fashionable
tailor
and
a
correspondingly
fashionable
price
his
rings
of
which
he
wore
several
were
massive
one
of
them
being
a
diamond
ring
of
considerable
value
his
boots
were
faultlessly
made
quite
new
and
polished
so
highly
that
it
dazzled
one
to
look
at
them
while
his
linen
of
which
he
displayed
a
large
quantity
on
the
breast
was
as
white
as
snow
not
london
snow
of
course
altogether
mr
clearemout
was
a
most
imposing
personage
come
in
he
said
in
a
voice
that
sounded
like
the
deep
soft
whisper
of
a
trombone
the
individual
who
had
occasioned
the
command
by
tapping
at
the
door
opened
it
just
enough
to
admit
his
head
which
he
thrust
into
the
room
it
was
a
shaggy
red
head
belonging
to
a
lad
of
apparently
eighteen
its
chief
characteristics
being
a
prolonged
nose
and
a
retracted
chin
with
a
gash
for
a
mouth
and
two
blue
holes
for
eyes
please
sir
mr
muddle
said
the
youth
admit
mr
muddle
the
head
disappeared
and
immediately
after
a
gentleman
sauntered
into
the
room
and
flung
himself
lazily
into
the
empty
armchair
which
stood
at
the
fireplace
to
the
one
in
which
mr
clearemout
sat
explaining
that
he
would
not
have
been
so
ceremonious
had
he
not
fancied
that
his
friend
was
engaged
with
some
one
on
business
how
are
you
jack
said
george
augustus
pretty
bobbish
replied
jack
he
was
the
same
jack
whom
we
have
already
introduced
as
being
mr
clearemout
friend
and
kindred
spirit
any
news
inquired
mr
clearemout
no
nothing
moving
said
jack
languidly
h
i
see
it
is
time
to
stir
now
jack
for
the
wheel
of
fortune
is
apt
to
get
stiff
and
creaky
if
we
do
grease
her
now
and
then
and
give
her
a
jog
here
is
a
little
pot
of
grease
which
i
have
been
concocting
and
intend
to
lay
on
immediately
he
took
a
slip
of
paper
from
a
large
which
lay
at
his
elbow
on
the
new
green
table
and
handed
it
to
his
friend
who
slowly
opened
and
read
it
in
a
slovenly
way
mumbling
the
most
of
it
as
he
went
on
dooem
in
just
cornwall
mumble
m

esquire
ahem
but
i
say
it
wo
do
to
publish
anything
of
this
sort
just
yet
you
know
said
secretary
jack
in
a
remonstrative
tone
for
there
nothing
doing
at
all
i
believe
i
beg
your
pardon
replied
the
managing
director
there
is
a
good
deal
doing
i
have
written
to
just
appointing
the
local
manager
and
it
is
probable
that
things
are
really
under
way
by
this
time
besides
i
shall
set
out
for
cornwall
to
superintend
matters
leaving
my
able
secretary
in
charge
here
in
the
meantime
and
when
he
hears
from
me
this
paper
may
be
completed
and
advertised
i
say
it
looks
awful
do
it
said
jack
with
a
grin
only
fancy
if
it
should
turn
out
to
be
a
good
mine
after
all
what
a
lark
would
be
and
it
might
you
know
for
it
a
real
one
once
was
it
and
if
you
set
a
few
fellows
to
sink
the
d
and
drive
the
thingumbobs
it
is
possible
they
may
come
upon
tin
and
copper
or
something
of
that
sort
would
it
be
jolly
of
course
it
would
and
that
is
the
very
thing
that
gives
zest
to
it
it
a
speculation
not
a
swindle
by
any
means
and
admirably
suits
our
easy
consciences
but
i
say
jack
you
break
yourself
off
talking
slang
it
will
never
do
to
have
the
secretary
of
the
great
wheal
dooem
mining
company
talk
like
a
street
boy
besides
i
hate
slang
even
in
a
blackguard
not
to
mention
a
so
you
must
give
it
up
jack
you
really
must
else
you
ruin
the
concern
at
the
very
beginning
secretary
jack
started
into
animation
at
this
why
george
he
said
drawing
himself
up
i
can
throw
it
off
when
i
please
look
here
suppose
yourself
an
inquiring
speculator
ahem
i
assure
you
sir
that
the
prospects
of
this
mine
are
most
brilliant
and
the
discoveries
that
have
been
made
in
it
since
we
commenced
operations
are
incredible
absolutely
incredible
sir
some
of
the
lodes
the
word
is
it
are
immensely
rich
and
upwards
of
a
hundred
feet
thick
while
the
part
that
runs
under
the
sea
or
to
run
under
the
sea
at
a
depth
of
three
thousand
fathoms
is
probably
as
rich
in
copper
ore
as
the
celebrated
botallack
whose
majestic
headland
bristling
with
machinery
overhangs
the
raging
billows
of
the
wide
atlantic
etcetera
etcetera
o
george
it
a
great
lark
entirely
you
have
to
learn
your
lesson
a
little
better
else
you
make
a
great
mess
of
it
said
clearemout
a
muddle
of
it
according
to
my
name
and
destiny
george
said
the
secretary
a
muddle
of
it
and
a
fortune
it
here
the
secretary
threw
himself
back
in
the
and
grinned
at
the
opposite
wall
where
his
eye
fell
on
a
large
picture
which
changed
the
grin
into
a
stare
of
surprise
what
have
we
here
george
he
said
rising
and
fitting
a
gold
glass
in
his
eye
not
a
portrait
of
wheal
dooem
is
it
you
have
guessed
right
replied
the
other
i
made
a
few
sketches
on
the
spot
and
got
a
celebrated
artist
to
put
them
together
which
he
has
done
you
see
with
considerable
effect
here
in
the
foreground
you
observe
continued
the
managing
director
taking
up
a
new
white
pointer
stands
wheal
dooem
on
a
prominent
crag
overlooking
the
atlantic
with
gurnard
head
just
beyond
farther
over
we
have
the
celebrated
levant
mine
and
the
famous
botallack
and
the
great
wheal
owles
and
a
crowd
of
other
more
or
less
noted
mines
with
cape
cornwall
and
the
land
end
and
tolpedenpenwith
in
the
and
the
celebrated
logan
rock
behind
them
while
we
have
mounts
bay
with
the
beautiful
town
of
penzance
and
mount
and
the
lizard
in
the
background
with
france
in
the
remote
distance
dear
me
quite
a
geographical
study
i
declare
exclaimed
secretary
jack
examining
the
painting
with
some
care
can
you
really
see
all
these
places
at
once
from
wheal
dooem
not
exactly
from
wheal
dooem
jack
but
if
you
were
to
go
up
in
a
balloon
a
few
hundred
yards
above
the
spot
where
it
stands
you
might
see
all
on
a
very
clear
day
if
your
eyes
were
good
the
fact
is
that
i
regard
this
picture
as
a
triumph
of
art
exhibiting
powerfully
what
is
by
artists
termed
together
and
great
united
with
exceedingly
minute
detail
the
colouring
too
is
high
very
high
indeed
and
the
is
perfect
ha
interposed
jack
all
the
being
on
the
surface
and
the
down
in
the
mine
eh
exactly
so
replied
clearemout
it
is
a
splendid
picture
the
artist
regards
it
as
his
and
you
must
explain
it
to
all
who
come
to
the
office
as
well
as
those
magnificent
geological
sections
in
the
corner
which
it
would
be
well
by
the
way
to
have
hung
up
without
delay
they
arrived
only
this
morning
and
now
jack
having
explained
these
matters
i
will
leave
you
to
study
them
at
your
leisure
while
i
prepare
for
my
journey
to
cornwall
where
by
the
way
i
have
my
eye
upon
a
sweet
little
girl
whose
uncle
i
believe
has
lots
of
tin
both
in
the
real
and
figurative
sense
of
the
word
something
may
come
of
it
who
knows
next
morning
saw
the
managing
director
on
the
road
and
in
due
time
he
found
his
way
by
coach
kittereen
and
gig
to
just
where
as
before
he
was
hospitably
received
by
old
mr
donnithorne
that
gentleman
buoyancy
of
spirit
however
was
not
quite
so
great
as
it
had
been
a
few
months
before
but
that
did
not
much
affect
the
spirits
of
clearemout
who
found
good
mrs
donnithorne
as
motherly
and
rose
ellis
as
sweet
as
ever
it
happened
at
this
time
that
oliver
trembath
had
occasion
to
go
to
london
about
some
matter
relating
to
his
deceased
mother
affairs
so
the
managing
director
had
the
field
all
to
himself
he
therefore
spent
his
time
agreeably
in
looking
after
the
affairs
of
wheal
dooem
during
the
day
and
making
love
to
rose
ellis
in
the
evening
poor
rose
was
by
no
means
a
flirt
but
she
was
an
innocent
straightforward
girl
ignorant
of
many
of
the
world
ways
and
of
a
trusting
disposition
she
found
the
conversation
of
mr
clearemout
agreeable
and
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
the
fact
mr
vanity
induced
him
to
set
this
down
to
a
tender
feeling
although
rose
never
consciously
gave
him
by
word
or
look
the
slightest
reason
to
come
to
such
a
conclusion
one
forenoon
mr
clearemout
was
sitting
in
mr
donnithorne
conversing
with
rose
and
mrs
donnithorne
when
the
old
gentleman
entered
and
sat
down
beside
them
i
had
almost
forgotten
the
original
object
of
my
visit
this
morning
said
the
managing
director
with
a
smile
and
a
glance
at
rose
the
fact
is
that
i
am
in
want
of
a
man
to
work
at
wheal
dooem
a
steady
trustworthy
man
who
would
be
fit
to
take
charge
become
a
sort
of
overseer
can
you
recommend
one
mr
donnithorne
paused
for
a
moment
to
reflect
but
mrs
donnithorne
deeming
reflection
quite
unnecessary
at
once
replied
why
there
are
many
such
men
in
just
there
john
cock
as
good
a
man
as
you
could
find
in
all
the
parish
and
david
trevarrow
and
james
penrose
he
a
man
you
remember
him
my
dear
turning
to
her
worse
half
one
of
our
locals
you
know
yes
my
dear
i
remember
him
you
could
not
mr
clearemout
get
a
better
man
i
should
say
i
think
you
observed
madam
said
mr
clearemout
that
this
man
is
a
pray
what
is
a
local
rose
gave
one
of
her
little
laughs
at
this
point
and
her
worthy
aunt
exclaimed
la
mr
clearemout
do
you
know
what
a
local
preacher
is
oh
a
connected
with
the
methodist
body
i
presume
yes
and
a
man
i
assure
you
but
said
mr
clearemout
with
a
smile
i
want
a
miner
not
a
preacher
well
he
is
a
miner
and
a
good
one
too
allow
to
explain
my
dear
said
mr
donnithorne
interrupting
his
spouse
you
may
not
be
aware
sir
that
many
of
our
miners
are
men
of
considerable
mental
ability
and
some
of
them
possess
such
power
of
speech
and
so
earnest
a
spirit
that
the
wesleyan
body
have
appointed
them
to
the
office
of
local
preaching
they
do
not
become
ministers
however
nor
are
they
liable
to
be
sent
out
of
the
district
like
them
they
do
give
up
their
ordinary
calling
but
are
appointed
to
preach
in
the
various
chapels
of
the
district
in
which
they
reside
and
thus
we
accomplish
an
amount
of
work
which
could
not
possibly
be
overtaken
by
the
ordinary
ministry
indeed
but
are
they
not
untrained
men
liable
to
teach
erroneous
doctrine
asked
mr
clearemout
they
are
not
altogether
untrained
men
replied
mr
donnithorne
they
are
subjected
to
a
searching
examination
and
must
give
full
proof
of
their
christianity
knowledge
and
ability
before
being
appointed
and
good
excellent
christian
men
many
of
them
are
observed
mrs
donnithorne
with
much
fervour
quite
true
said
her
husband
this
james
penrose
is
one
of
our
best
local
preachers
and
sometimes
officiates
in
our
principal
chapel
i
confess
however
that
those
who
have
the
management
of
this
matter
are
not
always
very
judicious
in
their
appointments
some
of
our
young
men
are
sorely
tempted
to
show
off
their
acquirements
and
preach
instead
of
the
gospel
and
there
are
one
or
two
whom
i
could
mention
whose
hearts
are
all
right
but
whose
brains
are
so
muddled
and
empty
that
they
are
utterly
unfit
to
teach
their
fellows
we
must
not
however
look
for
perfection
in
this
world
mr
clearemout
a
little
chaff
will
always
remain
among
the
wheat
there
is
no
system
without
some
imperfection
and
i
am
convinced
that
upon
the
whole
our
system
of
appointing
local
preachers
is
a
one
at
all
events
it
works
well
which
is
one
of
the
best
proofs
of
its
excellence
perhaps
so
said
mr
clearemout
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
did
not
choose
to
express
an
opinion
on
the
subject
nevertheless
i
had
rather
have
a
man
who
was
a
local
preacher
you
can
see
and
hear
him
and
judge
for
yourself
said
mr
donnithorne
for
he
is
i
believe
to
preach
in
our
chapel
and
if
you
will
accept
of
a
seat
in
our
pew
it
will
afford
my
wife
and
myself
much
thank
you
interrupted
mr
clearemout
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
take
advantage
of
your
kind
offer
service
you
say
begins
at
ten
precisely
said
mr
donnithorne
chapter
twenty
five
shows
the
miner
in
his
sunday
garb
and
astonishes
clearemout
besides
relating
some
incidents
of
an
accident
the
sun
rose
bright
and
hot
on
sunday
morning
but
the
little
birds
were
up
before
the
great
luminary
singing
their
morning
hymn
with
noisy
delight
it
was
a
peaceful
day
the
wind
was
at
rest
and
the
sea
was
calm
in
the
ancient
town
of
just
it
was
peculiarly
peaceful
for
the
numerous
and
untiring
stamps
which
all
the
week
had
continued
their
clang
and
clatter
morning
noon
and
night
without
intermission
found
rest
on
that
hallowed
day
and
the
great
engines
ceased
to
bow
their
massive
heads
with
the
exception
of
those
that
worked
the
pumps
even
these
however
were
required
to
do
as
little
work
as
was
compatible
with
the
due
drainage
of
the
mines
and
as
their
huge
pulsations
were
intermittent
few
and
far
between
they
did
not
succeed
in
disturbing
the
universal
serenity
of
the
morning
if
there
are
in
this
country
men
who
more
than
any
other
need
repose
we
should
say
they
are
the
miners
of
cornwall
for
their
week
work
is
exhausting
far
beyond
that
of
most
other
labourers
in
the
kingdom
perhaps
the
herculean
men
employed
in
works
toil
as
severely
but
besides
the
cheering
consciousness
of
being
well
paid
for
their
labour
these
men
exert
their
powers
in
the
midst
of
sunlight
and
fresh
air
while
the
miners
toil
in
bad
air
and
get
little
pay
in
hard
times
sunday
is
indeed
to
them
the
it
is
literally
what
that
word
signifies
a
day
of
rest
for
body
soul
and
spirit
pity
that
the
good
old
word
which
god
gave
us
is
not
more
universally
used
among
christians
would
it
not
have
been
better
that
the
translation
had
been
adopted
so
that
even
ignorant
men
might
have
understood
its
true
signification
than
that
we
should
have
saddled
it
with
a
heathen
name
to
be
an
apple
of
discord
in
all
generations
however
sunday
it
is
so
sunday
it
will
stand
we
suppose
as
long
as
the
world
lasts
after
all
despite
its
faulty
origin
that
word
is
invested
with
old
and
hallowed
associations
in
the
minds
of
many
so
we
enter
our
protest
against
the
folly
of
our
forefathers
very
humbly
beseeching
those
who
are
prone
to
become
nettled
on
this
subject
to
excuse
our
audacity
well
as
we
have
said
the
sunday
morning
to
which
we
refer
was
peaceful
so
would
have
been
maggot
household
had
maggot
youngest
baby
never
been
born
but
having
been
born
that
robust
cherub
asserted
his
right
to
freedom
of
action
more
violently
than
ever
did
the
most
rabid
radical
or
tyrannical
tory
he
swarmed
about
the
house
and
kicked
and
yelled
his
uttermost
to
the
great
distress
of
poor
little
grace
whose
anxiety
to
get
him
ready
for
chapel
was
gradually
becoming
feverish
but
baby
maggot
had
as
much
objection
to
go
to
chapel
as
his
wicked
father
who
was
at
that
time
enjoying
a
pipe
on
the
cliffs
and
intended
to
leave
his
family
to
the
escort
of
david
trevarrow
fortunately
baby
gave
in
about
nine
so
that
little
grace
had
him
washed
and
dressed
and
on
his
way
to
chapel
in
pretty
good
time
all
things
considered
no
one
who
entered
the
wesleyan
chapel
of
just
that
morning
for
the
first
time
could
have
imagined
that
a
large
proportion
of
the
people
who
filled
the
pews
were
miners
and
balmaidens
some
of
the
latter
were
elegantly
we
might
almost
say
gorgeously
attired
insomuch
that
but
for
their
hands
and
speech
they
might
almost
have
passed
for
ladies
of
fashion
the
very
latest
thing
in
bonnets
and
the
newest
mantles
were
to
be
seen
on
their
pretty
heads
and
shapely
shoulders
as
we
have
said
before
and
now
repeat
this
circumstance
arose
from
the
frequency
of
the
visits
of
the
individual
styled
johnny
fortnight
whose
great
aim
and
end
in
life
is
to
supply
miners
chiefly
the
females
among
them
with
the
necessaries
and
unnecessaries
of
wearing
apparel
when
the
managing
director
entered
mr
donnithorne
pew
and
sat
down
beside
his
buxom
hostess
he
felt
but
of
course
was
much
too
well
bred
to
express
astonishment
for
his
host
had
told
him
that
a
large
number
of
the
people
who
attended
the
chapel
were
miners
and
for
a
time
he
failed
to
see
any
of
the
class
whom
he
had
hitherto
been
accustomed
to
associate
with
and
torn
garbs
and
dirty
hands
and
faces
but
he
soon
observed
that
many
of
the
stalwart
men
with
black
coats
and
white
linen
had
strong
muscular
hands
with
knuckles
which
in
some
instances
exhibited
old
or
recent
cuts
and
bruises
it
was
a
new
sight
for
the
managing
director
to
behold
the
large
and
apparently
families
filing
into
the
pews
for
to
say
truth
mr
clearemout
was
not
much
in
the
habit
of
attending
church
and
he
had
never
before
entered
a
methodist
chapel
he
watched
with
much
curiosity
the
gradual
filling
of
the
seats
and
the
grave
quiet
demeanour
of
the
people
especially
interesting
was
it
when
maggot
family
came
in
and
sat
down
with
the
baby
maggot
in
charge
of
little
grace
mr
clearemout
had
met
maggot
and
had
seen
his
family
but
interest
gave
place
to
astonishment
when
mrs
penrose
walked
into
the
church
backed
by
her
sixteen
children
the
eldest
males
among
whom
were
miners
and
the
eldest
females
while
the
little
males
and
females
aspired
to
be
miners
and
in
the
course
of
time
that
penrose
family
whispered
mr
donnithorne
to
his
guest
what
the
local
family
mr
donnithorne
nodded
soon
after
a
tall
gentlemanly
man
ascended
the
pulpit
the
managing
director
was
disappointed
he
had
come
there
to
hear
a
miner
preach
and
behold
a
clergyman
who
is
he
inquired
clearemout
but
mr
donnithorne
did
not
answer
he
was
looking
up
the
hymn
for
mrs
d
who
being
claimed
exemption
from
the
duty
of
looking
up
anything
besides
he
was
a
kind
good
man
at
heart
though
rather
fond
of
smuggling
and
given
to
the
bottle
according
to
oliver
trembath
account
of
him
and
liked
to
pay
his
wife
little
attentions
but
there
were
still
greater
novelties
in
store
for
the
london
man
that
morning
it
was
new
to
him
to
hear
john
wesley
beautiful
hymns
sung
to
equally
beautiful
tunes
which
were
not
however
unfamiliar
to
his
ear
and
sung
with
a
degree
of
fervour
that
quite
drowned
his
own
voice
powerful
and
deep
though
it
was
it
was
a
new
and
impressive
thing
to
hear
the
thrilling
earnest
tones
of
the
preacher
as
he
offered
up
an
eloquent
extempore
prayer
to
the
petitions
in
which
many
of
the
people
in
the
congregation
gave
utterance
at
times
to
startlingly
fervent
and
loud
responses
not
in
set
phraseology
but
in
words
that
were
called
forth
by
the
nature
of
each
petition
such
as
glory
to
god
amen
thanks
be
to
him
showing
that
the
worshippers
followed
and
sympathised
with
their
spokesman
thus
making
his
prayer
their
own
but
the
newest
thing
of
all
was
to
hear
the
preacher
deliver
an
eloquent
earnest
able
and
sermon
without
book
or
note
in
the
same
natural
tone
of
voice
with
which
a
man
might
address
his
fellow
in
the
street
a
style
of
address
which
riveted
the
attention
of
the
hearers
induced
them
to
expect
that
he
had
really
something
important
to
say
to
them
and
that
he
thoroughly
believed
in
the
truth
of
what
he
said
a
powerful
man
observed
the
managing
director
as
they
went
out
your
clergyman
i
suppose
no
sir
replied
mr
donnithorne
with
a
chuckle
our
minister
is
preaching
elsewhere
that
was
james
penrose
what
the
miner
exclaimed
clearemout
in
astonishment
ay
the
local
preacher
too
why
the
man
spoke
like
demosthenes
and
quoted
bacon
locke
milton
and
i
know
not
whom
all
you
amaze
me
said
mr
clearemout
surely
all
your
local
preachers
are
not
equal
to
this
one
alas
no
some
of
the
young
ones
are
indeed
able
enough
to
spout
poetry
and
quote
old
authors
and
too
fond
they
are
of
doing
so
nevertheless
as
i
have
said
to
you
before
most
of
the
local
preachers
are
sterling
christian
men
and
a
few
of
them
have
eminent
capabilities
had
penrose
been
a
younger
man
he
would
probably
have
entered
the
ministry
but
being
above
forty
with
an
uncommonly
large
family
he
thinks
it
his
duty
to
remain
as
he
is
and
do
as
much
good
as
he
can
but
surely
he
might
find
employment
better
suited
to
his
talents
said
clearemout
there
is
not
much
scope
in
just
replied
mr
donnithorne
with
a
smile
and
it
is
a
serious
thing
for
a
man
in
his
circumstances
to
change
his
abode
and
vocation
no
no
i
think
he
is
right
to
remain
a
miner
well
i
confess
that
i
admire
his
talents
returned
clearemout
but
i
still
think
that
an
ordinary
miner
would
suit
me
better
well
i
know
of
one
who
will
suit
you
admirably
he
is
common
enough
to
look
at
and
if
you
will
accompany
me
into
the
mine
introduce
you
to
him
i
not
fond
of
descending
the
ladders
nowadays
though
i
could
do
it
very
well
when
a
youth
but
as
the
man
i
speak
of
works
in
one
of
the
levels
near
the
surface
i
be
glad
to
go
down
with
you
and
captain
dan
shall
lead
us
true
to
his
word
the
old
gentleman
met
mr
clearemout
the
following
morning
at
nine
and
accompanied
him
down
into
the
mine
their
descent
was
unmarked
by
anything
particular
at
first
they
wore
the
usual
suit
of
underground
clothing
and
each
carried
a
lighted
candle
attached
to
his
hat
after
descending
about
thirty
fathoms
they
left
the
main
shaft
and
traversed
the
windings
of
a
level
until
they
came
to
a
place
where
the
sound
of
voices
and
hammers
indicated
that
the
miners
were
working
in
a
few
seconds
they
reached
the
end
of
the
level
here
two
men
were
driving
the
level
and
another
a
very
tall
powerful
man
was
standing
in
a
hole
driven
up
into
the
roof
and
cutting
the
rock
above
his
head
his
attitude
and
aspect
were
extremely
picturesque
standing
as
he
did
on
a
raised
platform
with
his
legs
firmly
planted
his
muscular
arms
raised
above
him
to
cut
the
rock
overhead
and
the
candle
so
placed
as
to
cause
his
figure
to
appear
almost
black
and
unnaturally
gigantic
stay
a
minute
captain
dan
said
mr
donnithorne
that
mr
clearemout
is
the
man
i
spoke
of
what
think
you
of
his
personal
appearance
clearemout
did
not
reply
for
a
few
minutes
but
stood
silently
watching
the
man
as
he
continued
to
wield
his
heavy
hammer
with
powerful
strokes
delivering
each
with
a
species
of
gasp
which
indicated
not
exhaustion
but
the
stern
vigour
with
which
it
was
given
he
do
said
clearemout
in
a
decided
tone
hallo
james
shouted
mr
donnithorne
hallo
sir
answered
the
man
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
there
a
gentleman
here
who
wants
to
speak
to
you
the
miner
flung
down
his
tools
which
clattered
loudly
on
the
hard
rock
as
he
leaped
from
his
perch
with
the
agility
of
one
whose
muscles
are
all
in
full
and
constant
exercise
what
not
the
local
before
the
managing
director
could
finish
his
sentence
mr
donnithorne
introduced
him
to
james
penrose
and
left
the
two
for
a
time
to
talk
together
it
need
scarcely
be
added
that
clearemout
was
quite
willing
to
avail
himself
of
the
services
of
the
local
but
the
local
did
not
meet
his
proposals
so
readily
as
he
would
have
wished
penrose
was
a
cautious
man
and
said
he
would
call
on
mr
clearemout
in
the
evening
after
he
had
had
time
to
consider
the
matter
with
this
reply
the
other
was
fain
to
rest
satisfied
and
shortly
after
he
returned
to
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
with
his
friends
leaving
the
hardy
miner
to
pursue
his
work
at
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
they
were
accosted
by
a
sturdy
little
man
who
told
them
that
a
large
piece
of
timber
was
being
sent
down
the
shaft
and
it
would
be
advisable
to
wait
until
it
reached
the
bottom
is
it
on
the
way
spankey
asked
captain
dan

spankey

a
humorous
individual
addicted
to
joking

spankey
asked
clearemout
looking
down
with
a
grin
at
the
dirty
little
fellow
beside
him
iss

two
wives

spankey
iss
six
countin
the
wan
that
died
before
it
could
spaik
at
this
point
the
beam
was
heard
coming
down
in
a
few
seconds
it
made
its
appearance
and
was
hauled
a
little
to
one
side
by
spankey
who
proceeded
to
unwind
the
chain
that
had
supported
it
i
give
the
signal
captain
dan
to
haul
up
the
chain
before
thee
do
go
on
the
ladders
the
signal
was
given
accordingly
and
the
engine
immediately
began
to
draw
up
the
chain
by
which
the
beam
had
been
lowered
this
chain
had
a
hook
at
one
end
of
it
and
as
would
have
it
the
hook
caught
spankey
by
the
right
leg
of
his
trousers
and
whisked
him
off
his
feet
almost
before
those
beside
him
could
conceive
what
had
happened
the
unfortunate
man
went
up
the
shaft
feet
foremost
with
a
succession
of
dreadful
yells
in
the
midst
of
which
could
be
heard
a
fearful
rending
of
strong
linen
fortunately
for
spankey
his
nether
garments
were
not
only
strong
but
new
so
that
when
the
rend
came
to
the
seam
at
the
foot
it
held
on
else
had
that
facetious
miner
come
down
the
shaft
much
faster
than
he
went
up
and
left
his
brains
at
the
bottom
as
a
memorial
of
the
shocking
event
with
palpitating
hearts
captain
dan
clearemout
and
old
donnithorne
ran
up
the
ladders
as
fast
as
they
could
in
a
few
minutes
they
reached
the
level
and
here
to
their
great
relief
they
found
spankey
supported
in
the
arms
of
stout
joe
tonkin
that
worthy
true
to
his
promise
to
oliver
trembath
had
gone
to
work
in
botallack
mine
and
had
that
very
day
commenced
operations
in
the
level
referred
to
hearing
the
terrible
screams
of
spankey
he
rushed
to
the
end
of
the
level
just
as
the
unfortunate
man
was
passing
it
the
risk
was
great
but
tonkin
was
accustomed
to
risks
and
prompt
to
act
he
flung
his
arms
round
spankey
drew
him
forcibly
into
the
level
and
held
on
for
life
there
was
a
terrible
rend
the
leg
of
the
trousers
gave
way
at
the
hip
and
went
flapping
up
to
grass
leaving
the
horrified
miner
behind
not
gone
dead
yet
sur
but
goin
fast
was
spankey
pathetic
reply
to
captain
dan
anxious
inquiries
it
was
found
however
that
beyond
the
fright
the
man
had
received
no
damage
whatever
the
only
other
noteworthy
fact
in
reference
to
this
incident
is
that
when
captain
dan
and
his
companions
reached
the
surface
they
were
met
by
the
lander
who
with
a
face
as
pale
as
a
ghost
held
up
the
torn
garment
great
was
this
man
relief
and
loud
the
fit
of
laughter
with
which
he
expressed
it
when
spankey
issuing
from
the
mouth
of
the
shaft
presented
his
naked
limb
and
claimed
the
leg
of
his
trousers
chapter
twenty
six
tells
of
a
discovery
and
a
disaster
that
afternoon
another
accident
occurred
in
the
mine
which
was
of
a
much
more
serious
nature
than
the
one
just
recorded
and
which
interfered
somewhat
with
the
plans
of
the
managing
director
of
the
great
wheal
dooem
mining
company
not
long
after
his
interview
with
clearemout
james
penrose
finished
a
and
called
to
zackey
maggot
to
fetch
the
fuse
zackey
had
been
working
for
a
week
past
in
connection
with
penrose
and
at
the
time
he
was
called
was
engaged
in
his
wonted
occupation
of
pounding
tamping
wherewith
to
fill
the
hole
wherever
zackey
chanced
to
be
at
work
he
always
made
himself
as
comfortable
as
circumstances
would
admit
of
at
the
present
time
he
had
discovered
a
little
hollow
or
recess
in
the
wall
of
the
level
which
he
had
converted
into
a
private
chamber
for
the
nonce
there
was
a
piece
of
flat
rock
on
the
floor
of
this
recess
which
zackey
used
as
his
anvil
and
in
front
of
which
he
kneeled
at
his
side
was
a
candle
stuck
against
the
wall
where
it
poured
a
flood
of
light
on
objects
in
its
immediate
neighbourhood
and
threw
the
boy
magnified
shadow
over
the
floor
and
against
the
opposite
wall
of
the
level
above
his
head
was
a
small
shelf
which
he
had
ingeniously
fixed
in
a
narrow
part
of
the
cell
and
on
this
lay
a
few
candles
a
stone
bottle
of
water
a
blasting
fuse
and
part
of
his
lunch
which
he
had
been
unable
to
consume
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
paper
a
small
wooden
box
on
the
floor
and
a
couple
of
leaning
against
the
wall
completed
the
furniture
of
this
subterranean
grotto
zackey
besides
being
a
searcher
after
metals
possessed
an
unusual
amount
of
metal
in
himself
he
was
one
of
those
earnest
boys
who
pass
into
a
state
of
full
manhood
do
the
work
of
men
and
are
looked
upon
as
being
men
before
they
have
passed
out
of
their
teens
the
boy
manhood
which
was
even
at
that
early
period
of
his
life
beginning
to
show
itself
consisted
not
in
his
looks
or
his
gait
although
both
were
creditable
but
in
his
firmness
of
purpose
and
force
of
character
what
zackey
undertook
to
do
he
always
did
he
never
left
any
work
in
a
state
and
he
always
employed
time
diligently
in
the
mine
he
commenced
to
labour
the
moment
he
entered
and
he
never
ceased
except
during
a
short
period
for
kroust
until
it
was
time
to
shoulder
his
tools
and
mount
to
the
regions
of
light
above
ground
he
was
as
ready
to
skylark
as
the
most
volatile
of
his
companions
but
underground
he
was
a
pattern
of
perseverance
a
true
cornish
miner
in
miniature
his
energy
of
character
was
doubtless
due
to
his
reckless
father
but
his
steadiness
was
the
result
of
uncle
davy
counsel
and
example
are
you
coming
zackey
shouted
penrose
from
the
end
of
the
level
iss
i
comin
replied
the
boy
taking
the
fuse
from
the
shelf
and
hastening
towards
his
companion
penrose
had
a
peculiar
and
pleased
expression
on
his
countenance
which
zackey
observed
at
once
what
do
grizzle
like
that
for
inquired
the
boy
i
come
on
a
splendid
bunch
of
copper
zackey
replied
the
man
you
and
i
shall
make
money
soon
run
away
to
your
work
lad
and
come
back
when
you
hear
the
shot
go
off
zackey
expressed
a
hope
that
the
prophecy
might
come
true
and
returned
to
his
cell
where
he
continued
pounding
diligently
thinking
the
while
of
rich
ore
and
a
rapid
fortune
there
was
more
reason
in
these
thoughts
than
one
might
suppose
for
cornish
miners
experience
variety
of
fortune
sometimes
a
man
will
labour
for
weeks
and
months
in
unproductive
ground
following
up
a
small
vein
in
the
hope
of
its
leading
into
a
good
lode
and
making
so
little
by
his
hard
toil
that
on
pay
day
of
each
month
he
is
compelled
to
ask
his
employer
for
subsist
or
a
small
advance
of
money
to
enable
him
to
live
and
go
on
with
his
work
often
he
is
obliged
to
give
up
in
despair
and
change
to
a
more
promising
part
of
the
mine
or
to
go
to
another
mine
altogether
but
not
unfrequently
he
is
rewarded
for
his
perseverance
by
coming
at
last
to
a
rich
lode
or
mass
or
bunch
of
copper
or
tin
ore
out
of
which
he
will
rend
in
a
single
month
as
much
as
will
entitle
him
to
thirty
or
forty
or
even
a
hundred
pounds
next
pay
day
such
pieces
of
good
fortune
are
not
of
rare
occurrence
many
of
the
substantial
new
cottages
to
be
seen
in
just
at
the
present
day
have
been
built
by
miners
who
became
suddenly
fortunate
in
this
way
so
that
although
the
miner
of
cornwall
always
works
hard
and
often
suffers
severe
privation
he
works
on
with
a
expectation
of
a
sudden
burst
of
temporal
sunshine
in
his
otherwise
hard
lot
zackey
maggot
was
dreaming
of
some
such
gleam
of
good
fortune
and
patiently
pounding
away
at
the
tamping
when
he
heard
the
explosion
of
the
blast
at
the
same
moment
a
loud
cry
rang
through
the
underground
caverns
it
was
one
of
those
terrible
unmistakable
cries
which
chill
the
blood
and
thrill
the
hearts
of
those
who
hear
them
telling
of
some
awful
catastrophe
the
boy
leaped
up
and
ran
swiftly
towards
the
end
of
the
level
where
he
called
to
his
companion
but
received
no
answer
the
smoke
which
filled
the
place
was
so
dense
that
he
could
not
see
and
could
scarcely
breathe
he
ran
forward
however
and
stumbled
over
the
prostrate
form
of
penrose
zackey
guessed
correctly
what
had
occurred
for
the
accident
was
and
alas
still
is
too
common
in
the
mines
the
shot
had
apparently
missed
fire
penrose
had
gone
forward
to
examine
it
and
it
exploded
in
his
face
to
lift
his
companion
was
beyond
zackey
power
to
leave
him
lying
in
such
dense
smoke
for
any
length
of
time
would
he
knew
ensure
his
suffocation
so
he
attempted
to
drag
him
away
but
the
man
was
too
heavy
for
him
in
his
extremity
the
poor
boy
uttered
a
wild
cry
for
help
but
he
shouted
in
vain
for
there
was
no
one
else
at
work
in
the
level
but
zackey
was
not
the
boy
to
give
way
to
despair
or
to
act
thoughtlessly
or
in
wild
haste
in
this
emergency
he
suddenly
recollected
that
there
was
a
rope
somewhere
about
the
level
he
sought
for
and
found
it
fastening
an
end
of
it
round
the
body
of
the
man
under
the
armpits
he
so
arranged
that
the
knot
of
the
loop
should
reach
a
few
inches
beyond
his
head
and
on
this
part
of
the
loop
he
spread
a
coat
which
thus
formed
a
support
to
the
head
and
prevented
it
being
dragged
along
the
ground
while
engaged
in
this
operation
the
poor
boy
was
suffocated
with
smoke
and
had
to
run
back
once
to
where
the
air
was
purer
in
order
to
catch
a
breath
or
two
then
returning
he
seized
the
rope
passed
it
over
his
shoulder
and
bending
forward
with
all
his
might
and
main
dragged
the
man
slowly
but
steadily
along
the
floor
of
the
level
to
a
place
where
the
air
was
comparatively
pure
leaving
him
there
he
quickly
fixed
a
candle
in
his
hat
and
carrying
another
in
his
hand
to
avoid
the
risk
of
being
left
in
darkness
by
an
accidental
stumble
or
gust
of
air
zackey
darted
swiftly
along
the
level
and
ran
up
the
ladders
at
his
utmost
speed
panting
for
breath
and
with
eyes
almost
starting
from
their
sockets
he
rushed
into
the
and
told
the
man
in
charge
what
had
occurred
then
he
dashed
away
to
the
and
gave
the
alarm
there
so
that
in
a
very
few
minutes
a
number
of
men
descended
the
shaft
and
gathered
round
the
prostrate
miner
the
doctor
who
had
taken
oliver
place
during
his
absence
was
soon
in
attendance
and
found
that
although
no
bones
had
been
broken
penrose
face
was
badly
injured
how
deep
the
injury
extended
could
not
at
that
time
be
ascertained
but
he
feared
that
his
eyes
had
been
altogether
destroyed
after
the
application
of
some
cordial
the
unfortunate
man
began
to
revive
and
the
first
words
he
uttered
were
praise
the
lord
evidently
in
reference
to
his
life
having
been
spared
is
that
you
zackey
he
inquired
after
a
few
moments
no
it
is
the
doctor
my
man
do
you
feel
much
pain
in
your
head
he
asked
as
he
knelt
beside
him
not
much
there
is
a
stunned
feeling
about
it
but
little
pain
better
light
a
candle
there
are
candles
burning
round
you
said
the
doctor
do
you
not
see
them
there
is
one
close
to
your
face
at
this
moment
penrose
made
no
answer
on
hearing
this
but
an
expression
of
deep
gravity
seemed
to
settle
on
the
blackened
features
we
must
get
him
up
as
soon
as
possible
said
the
doctor
turning
to
captain
dan
who
stood
at
his
elbow
we
all
ready
sir
replied
the
captain
who
had
quietly
procured
ropes
and
a
blanket
while
the
doctor
was
examining
the
wounds
with
great
labour
and
difficulty
the
injured
man
was
half
hauled
half
carried
and
pushed
up
the
shaft
and
laid
on
the
grass
is
the
sun
shining
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
iss
it
do
shine
right
in
thee
face
jim
said
one
of
the
miners
brushing
away
a
tear
with
the
back
of
his
hand
again
the
gravity
of
penrose
countenance
appeared
to
deepen
but
he
uttered
no
other
word
so
they
brought
an
old
door
and
laid
him
on
it
six
strong
men
raised
it
gently
on
their
shoulders
and
with
slow
steps
and
downcast
faces
they
carried
the
wounded
miner
home
chapter
twenty
seven
indicates
that
we
little
know
what
great
things
from
little
things
may
rise
soon
after
this
accident
to
james
penrose
the
current
of
events
at
the
mines
was
diverted
from
its
course
by
several
incidents
which
like
the
obstructing
rocks
in
a
rapid
created
some
eddies
and
whirlpools
in
the
lives
of
those
personages
with
whom
this
chronicle
has
to
do
as
the
beginning
of
a
mighty
inundation
is
an
leak
and
as
the
cause
of
a
series
of
great
events
is
not
unfrequently
a
trifling
incident
so
the
noteworthy
circumstances
which
we
have
still
to
lay
before
our
readers
were
brought
about
by
a
very
small
matter
by
a
baby
baby
maggot
one
morning
that
cherubical
creature
opened
its
eyes
at
a
much
earlier
hour
than
usual
and
stared
at
the
ceiling
of
its
father
cottage
the
sun
was
rising
and
sent
its
unobstructed
rays
through
the
window
of
maggot
cottage
where
it
danced
on
the
ceiling
as
if
its
sole
purpose
in
rising
had
been
to
amuse
the
maggot
baby
if
so
it
was
successful
in
its
attempts
for
the
baby
lay
and
smiled
for
a
long
time
in
silent
ecstasy
of
course
we
do
not
mean
to
say
that
the
sun
itself
or
its
direct
rays
actually
danced
no
it
was
too
dignified
a
luminary
for
that
but
its
rays
went
straight
at
a
small
which
was
suspended
on
the
wall
opposite
to
the
window
and
this
being
hung
so
as
to
slope
forward
projected
the
rays
obliquely
into
a
tub
of
water
which
was
destined
for
family
washing
purposes
and
from
its
gently
moving
surface
they
were
transmitted
to
the
ceiling
where
as
aforesaid
they
danced
to
the
immense
delight
of
maggot
junior
the
door
of
the
cottage
had
been
carelessly
closed
the
previous
night
when
the
family
retired
to
rest
and
a
chink
of
it
was
open
through
which
a
light
draught
of
summer
air
came
in
this
will
account
for
the
ripple
on
the
water
which
as
every
observant
reader
will
note
ought
according
to
the
laws
of
gravitation
to
have
lain
perfectly
still
the
inconstancy
of
baby
maggot
nature
was
presently
exhibited
in
his
becoming
tired
of
the
sun
and
the
restlessness
of
his
disposition
displayed
itself
in
his
frantic
efforts
to
get
out
of
bed
being
boxed
in
with
a
board
this
was
not
an
easy
matter
but
the
urchin
limbs
were
powerful
and
he
finally
got
over
the
obstruction
sufficiently
far
to
lose
his
balance
and
fall
with
a
sounding
flop
on
the
floor
it
is
interesting
to
notice
how
soon
deceit
creeps
into
the
hearts
of
some
children
of
course
the
urchin
fell
babies
always
do
so
as
surely
as
cats
fall
on
their
feet
in
ordinary
circumstances
he
would
have
intimated
the
painful
mishap
with
a
dreadful
yell
but
on
this
particular
occasion
young
maggot
was
bent
on
mischief
of
what
sort
he
probably
had
no
idea
but
there
must
have
been
a
latent
feeling
of
an
intention
to
be
bad
in
some
way
or
other
because
on
reaching
the
ground
he
pursed
his
mouth
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
and
looked
cautiously
round
to
make
sure
that
the
noise
had
awakened
no
one
his
father
he
observed
with
a
feeling
of
relief
was
absent
from
home
not
a
matter
of
uncommon
occurrence
for
that
worthy
avocations
often
called
him
out
at
untimeous
hours
mrs
maggot
was
in
bed
snoring
and
wrinkling
up
her
nose
in
consequence
of
a
fly
having
perched
itself
obstinately
on
the
point
thereof
zackey
with
the
red
earth
of
the
mine
still
streaking
his
manly
countenance
was
like
a
ball
in
his
own
bed
in
a
dark
recess
of
the
room
and
little
grace
maggot
could
be
seen
in
the
dim
perspective
of
a
closet
also
sound
asleep
in
her
own
neat
little
bed
with
her
hair
streaming
over
the
pillow
and
the
chet
reposing
happily
on
her
neck
but
that
easily
satisfied
chet
had
long
ago
had
more
than
enough
of
rest
its
repose
was
light
and
the
sound
of
baby
maggot
falling
out
of
bed
caused
it
to
rise
yawn
arch
its
back
and
tail
and
prepare
itself
for
the
mingled
joys
and
torments
of
the
opening
day
observing
that
the
urchin
rose
and
staggered
with
a
gleeful
expression
towards
the
door
the
volatile
chet
made
a
dash
at
him
sidewise
and
gave
him
such
a
fright
that
he
fell
over
the
door
step
into
the
road
again
was
that
tender
babe
deceitfulness
of
character
displayed
for
instead
of
howling
as
he
would
have
done
on
other
occasions
he
exercised
severe
made
light
of
a
bruised
shin
and
gathering
himself
up
made
off
as
fast
as
his
fat
legs
could
carry
him
there
was
something
deeply
interesting
worthy
of
the
study
of
a
philosopher
in
the
subsequent
actions
of
that
precocious
urchin
his
powers
in
the
way
of
walking
were
not
much
greater
than
those
of
a
very
tipsy
man
and
he
swayed
his
arms
about
a
good
deal
to
maintain
his
balance
especially
at
the
outset
of
the
journey
when
he
imagined
that
he
heard
the
maternal
voice
in
anger
and
the
maternal
footsteps
in
pursuit
in
every
puff
of
wind
grunt
of
pig
or
bark
of
cur
his
entire
soul
was
engrossed
in
the
one
grand
vital
absorbing
idea
of
escape
by
degrees
as
distance
from
the
paternal
roof
increased
his
fluttering
spirit
grew
calmer
and
his
gait
more
steady
and
the
flush
of
victory
gathered
on
his
brow
and
sparkled
in
his
eye
as
the
conviction
was
pressed
home
upon
him
that
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
free
as
the
wind
of
heaven
to
go
where
he
pleased
to
do
what
he
liked
to
be
bad
as
without
let
or
hindrance
not
that
baby
maggot
had
any
stronger
desire
to
be
absolutely
wicked
than
most
other
children
of
his
years
but
having
learnt
from
experience
that
the
attempt
to
gratify
any
of
his
desires
was
usually
checked
and
termed
bad
he
naturally
felt
that
a
state
of
delight
so
intense
as
that
to
which
he
had
at
last
attained
must
necessarily
be
the
very
quintessence
of
iniquity
being
resolved
to
go
through
with
it
at
all
hazards
he
felt
proportionately
wild
and
reckless
such
a
state
of
commotion
was
there
in
his
heaving
bosom
owing
to
contradictory
and
conflicting
elements
that
he
felt
at
one
moment
inclined
to
lie
down
and
shout
for
joy
and
the
next
to
sink
into
the
earth
with
terror
time
which
proverbially
works
wonderful
changes
at
length
subdued
the
urchin
to
a
condition
of
calm
goodness
and
felicity
that
would
have
rejoiced
his
mother
heart
had
it
only
been
brought
on
in
ordinary
circumstances
at
home
there
is
a
piece
of
waste
ground
lying
between
just
and
the
sea
a
sort
of
common
covered
with
heath
and
furze
on
which
the
ancient
britons
have
left
their
indelible
mark
in
the
shape
of
pits
and
hollows
and
trenches
with
their
relative
mounds
and
hillocks
here
in
the
days
of
old
our
worthy
but
illiterate
forefathers
had
grubbed
and
dug
and
turned
up
every
square
foot
of
the
soil
like
a
colony
of
gigantic
rabbits
in
order
to
supply
the
precious
metal
of
the
country
to
the
phoenicians
jews
and
greeks
the
ground
on
this
common
is
so
riddled
with
holes
of
all
sizes
and
shapes
utterly
unguarded
by
any
kind
of
fence
that
it
requires
care
on
the
part
of
the
pedestrian
who
traverses
the
place
even
in
daylight
hence
the
mothers
of
just
are
naturally
anxious
that
the
younger
members
of
their
families
should
not
go
near
the
common
and
the
younger
members
are
as
naturally
anxious
that
they
should
visit
it
thither
in
the
course
of
time
for
it
was
not
far
distant
the
baby
maggot
naturally
trended
proceeding
on
the
principle
of
short
stages
and
long
rests
never
in
his
life
so
he
thought
had
he
seen
such
bright
and
beautiful
flowers
such
green
grass
and
such
lovely
yellow
sand
as
that
which
appeared
here
and
there
at
the
mouths
of
the
holes
and
old
shafts
or
such
a
delicious
balmy
and
breeze
as
that
which
came
off
the
atlantic
and
swept
across
the
common
no
wonder
that
his
eyes
drank
in
the
beautiful
sights
for
they
had
seen
little
of
earth
hitherto
save
the
four
walls
of
his
father
cottage
and
the
dead
garden
wall
in
front
of
it
no
wonder
that
his
nostrils
dilated
to
receive
the
sweet
odours
for
they
had
up
to
that
date
lived
upon
air
which
had
to
cross
a
noisome
and
stagnant
pool
of
filth
before
it
entered
his
father
dwelling
and
no
wonder
that
his
ears
thrilled
to
hear
the
carol
of
the
birds
for
they
had
previously
been
accustomed
chiefly
to
the
voices
of
poultry
and
pigs
and
to
the
caterwauling
of
the
chet
but
as
every
joy
has
its
alloy
so
our
youthful
traveller
feelings
began
to
be
modified
by
a
gnawing
sensation
of
hunger
as
his
usual
hour
for
breakfast
approached
still
he
wandered
on
manfully
looking
into
various
dark
and
deep
holes
with
much
interest
and
a
good
deal
of
awe
some
of
the
old
shafts
were
so
deep
that
no
bottom
could
be
seen
others
were
partially
filled
up
and
varied
from
five
to
twenty
feet
in
depth
some
were
nearly
perpendicular
others
were
sloped
and
irregular
in
form
but
all
were
more
or
less
fringed
with
gorse
bushes
in
full
bloom
in
a
few
cases
the
old
pits
were
concealed
by
these
bushes
it
is
almost
unnecessary
to
say
that
baby
maggot
progress
on
that
eventful
morn
was
unknown
to
himself
a
series
of
narrow
escapes
from
beginning
to
end
no
not
exactly
to
the
end
for
his
last
adventure
could
scarcely
be
deemed
an
escape
he
was
standing
on
the
edge
of
a
hole
which
was
partially
concealed
by
bushes
endeavouring
to
peer
into
it
he
lost
his
balance
and
fell
forward
his
ready
hands
grasped
the
gorse
and
received
innumerable
punctures
which
drew
forth
a
loud
cry
head
foremost
he
went
in
and
head
foremost
he
went
down
full
ten
feet
when
a
small
bush
caught
him
and
lowered
him
gently
to
the
ground
but
the
spot
on
which
he
was
landed
was
steep
it
sloped
towards
the
bottom
of
the
hole
which
turned
inwards
and
became
a
sort
of
cavern
struggling
to
regain
his
footing
he
slipped
and
rolled
violently
to
the
bottom
where
he
lay
for
a
few
minutes
either
stunned
or
too
much
astonished
to
move
then
he
recovered
a
little
and
began
to
whimper
after
which
he
felt
so
much
better
that
he
arose
and
attempted
to
get
out
of
the
hole
but
slipped
and
fell
back
again
whereupon
he
set
up
a
hideous
roar
which
continued
without
intermission
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
he
fell
sound
asleep
and
remained
in
happy
unconsciousness
for
several
hours
meanwhile
the
maggot
family
was
as
may
well
be
believed
thrown
into
a
state
of
tremendous
agitation
mrs
maggot
on
making
the
discovery
that
baby
had
succeeded
in
scaling
the
barricade
huddled
on
her
garments
and
roused
her
progeny
to
assist
in
the
search
at
first
she
was
not
alarmed
believing
that
she
should
certainly
find
the
urchin
near
the
house
perhaps
in
the
cottage
of
the
penroses
but
when
the
cottages
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
had
been
called
at
and
all
the
known
places
of
danger
round
the
house
examined
without
success
the
poor
woman
became
frantic
with
terror
and
roused
the
whole
neighbourhood
every
place
of
possible
and
impossible
concealment
was
searched
and
at
last
the
unhappy
mother
allowed
the
terrible
thought
to
enter
her
mind
that
baby
had
actually
accomplished
the
feat
of
reaching
the
dreaded
common
and
was
perhaps
at
that
moment
lying
maimed
or
dead
at
the
bottom
of
an
ancient
british
shaft
immediately
a
body
of
volunteers
consisting
of
men
women
and
children
and
headed
by
mrs
maggot
hastened
to
the
common
to
institute
a
thorough
search
but
they
searched
in
vain
for
the
holes
were
innumerable
and
the
one
in
which
the
baby
lay
was
well
concealed
by
bushes
besides
the
search
was
somewhat
wildly
and
hastily
made
so
that
some
spots
were
while
others
were
almost
overlooked
all
that
day
did
mrs
maggot
and
her
friends
wander
to
and
fro
over
the
common
and
never
since
the
days
when
phoenician
galleys
were
moored
by
michael
mount
did
the
eyes
of
human
beings
pry
so
earnestly
into
these
pits
and
holes
had
tin
been
their
object
they
could
not
have
been
more
eager
evening
came
night
drew
on
apace
and
at
last
the
forlorn
mother
sat
down
in
the
centre
of
a
furze
bush
and
began
to
weep
but
her
friends
comforted
her
they
urged
her
to
go
home
and
a
dish
o
tay
to
strengthen
her
for
the
renewal
of
the
search
by
they
assured
her
that
the
child
could
easily
exist
longer
than
a
day
without
food
and
they
reminded
her
that
her
baby
was
an
exceptional
baby
a
peculiar
baby
like
its
father
uncommonly
strong
and
like
its
mother
unusually
obstinate
the
latter
sentiment
however
was
not
expressed
under
the
influence
of
these
assurances
and
persuasions
mrs
maggot
went
home
and
for
a
short
time
the
common
was
deserted
now
it
chanced
curiously
enough
that
at
this
identical
point
of
time
maggot
senior
was
enjoying
a
pipe
and
a
glass
of
grog
in
a
celebrated
with
his
friend
joe
tonkin
this
or
low
was
known
as
un
or
aunt
jilly
at
bosarne
it
was
a
favourite
resort
of
smugglers
and
many
a
gallon
of
spirit
free
of
duty
had
been
consumed
on
the
premises
maggot
and
his
friend
were
alone
in
the
house
at
the
time
and
their
conversation
had
taken
a
dolorous
turn
for
many
things
had
occurred
of
late
to
disturb
the
equanimity
of
the
friends
several
ventures
in
the
smuggling
way
had
proved
unsuccessful
and
the
mines
did
not
offer
a
tempting
prospect
just
then
there
had
no
doubt
been
one
or
two
hopeful
veins
opened
up
and
some
good
pitches
had
been
wrought
but
these
were
only
small
successes
and
the
luck
had
not
fallen
to
either
of
themselves
the
recent
discovery
of
a
good
bunch
by
poor
penrose
had
not
been
fully
appreciated
for
the
wounded
man
had
as
yet
said
nothing
about
it
and
little
zackey
had
either
forgotten
all
about
it
in
the
excitement
of
the
accident
or
was
keeping
his
own
counsel
maggot
talked
gloomily
about
the
advisability
of
emigration
to
america
as
he
sent
clouds
of
tobacco
smoke
up
un
jilly
chimney
and
tonkin
said
he
would
try
the
mines
for
a
short
time
and
if
things
improve
he
would
go
to
sea
he
did
not
however
look
at
things
in
quite
the
same
light
with
his
friend
perhaps
he
was
of
a
more
hopeful
disposition
perhaps
had
met
with
fewer
disappointments
at
all
events
he
so
wrought
on
maggot
mind
that
he
half
induced
him
to
deny
his
smuggling
propensities
for
a
time
and
try
legitimate
work
in
the
mines
not
that
joe
tonkin
wanted
to
reform
him
by
any
means
but
he
was
himself
a
little
out
of
humour
with
his
old
profession
and
sought
to
set
his
friend
against
it
also
try
your
luck
in
botallack
said
joe
tonkin
knocking
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
preparatory
to
quitting
the
place
that
my
advice
to
booy
i
half
a
mind
to
replied
maggot
rising
if
that
theere
cargo
i
run
on
saturday
do
go
the
way
the
last
did
i
ha
done
with
it
so
i
will
un
jilly
an
do
go
tumblin
down
the
owld
shafts
said
the
worthy
hostess
observing
that
her
potent
brandy
had
rendered
the
gait
of
the
men
unsteady
they
laughed
as
they
received
the
caution
and
walked
together
towards
just
lev
us
go
see
if
the
toobs
are
all
safe
said
maggot
on
reaching
the
common
tonkin
agreed
and
they
turned
aside
into
a
narrow
track
which
led
across
the
waste
land
where
the
search
for
the
baby
had
been
so
diligently
carried
on
all
that
day
night
had
set
in
as
we
have
said
and
the
searchers
had
gone
up
to
the
town
to
partake
of
refreshment
and
obtain
torches
so
that
the
place
was
bleak
and
silent
as
well
as
dark
when
the
friends
crossed
it
but
they
knew
every
foot
of
the
ground
so
thoroughly
that
there
was
no
fear
of
their
stumbling
into
old
holes
maggot
led
the
way
and
he
walked
straight
to
the
old
shaft
where
his
hopeful
son
lay
there
were
three
noteworthy
points
of
coincidence
here
to
which
we
would
draw
attention
it
was
just
because
this
old
shaft
was
so
well
concealed
that
maggot
had
chosen
it
as
a
place
in
which
to
hide
his
tubs
of
smuggled
brandy
it
was
owing
to
the
same
reason
that
the
had
failed
to
discover
it
while
searching
for
the
baby
and
it
was
at
least
we
think
it
must
have
been
just
because
of
the
same
reason
that
baby
maggot
had
found
it
for
that
amiable
child
had
a
peculiar
talent
a
sort
of
vocation
for
ferreting
out
things
and
places
hidden
and
secret
especially
if
forbidden
having
succeeded
in
falling
into
the
hole
the
urchin
naturally
discovered
his
father
tubs
after
crying
himself
to
sleep
as
before
mentioned
and
again
awakening
his
curiosity
in
respect
to
these
tubs
afforded
him
amusement
and
kept
him
quiet
for
a
time
perhaps
the
fact
that
one
of
the
tubs
had
leaked
and
filled
the
lower
part
of
the
old
shaft
with
spirituous
fumes
may
account
for
the
baby
continuing
to
keep
quiet
and
falling
into
a
sleep
which
lasted
the
greater
part
of
the
day
at
all
events
it
is
certain
that
he
did
not
howl
as
might
have
been
expected
of
him
in
the
circumstances
towards
evening
however
he
began
to
move
about
among
the
tubs
and
to
sigh
and
whimper
in
a
subdued
way
for
his
stomach
unused
to
such
prolonged
fasting
felt
very
uncomfortable
when
darkness
came
on
baby
maggot
became
alarmed
but
just
about
the
time
of
his
father
approach
the
moon
shone
out
and
cast
a
cheering
ray
down
the
shaft
which
relieved
his
mind
a
little
joe
said
maggot
in
a
whisper
and
with
a
serious
look
some
one
have
bin
here
think
so
said
tonkin
iss
i
do
the
bushes
are
broken
a
bit
hush
what
that
the
two
men
paused
and
looked
at
each
other
with
awe
depicted
on
their
faces
while
they
listened
intently
but
in
the
words
of
the
touching
old
song
the
beating
of
their
own
hearts
was
all
the
sound
they
heard
it
wor
the
wind
said
maggot
iss
that
what
it
wor
replied
tonkin
come
lev
us
go
down
the
wind
ca
do
no
harm
to
we
but
although
he
proposed
to
advance
he
did
not
move
and
maggot
did
not
seem
inclined
to
lead
the
way
for
just
then
something
like
a
sigh
came
from
below
and
a
dark
cloud
passed
over
the
moon
it
is
no
uncommon
thing
to
find
that
men
who
are
physically
brave
as
lions
become
nervous
as
children
when
anything
bordering
on
what
they
deem
supernatural
meets
them
maggot
was
about
the
most
reckless
man
in
the
parish
of
just
and
tonkin
was
not
far
behind
him
in
the
quality
of
courage
yet
these
two
stood
there
with
palpitating
hearts
undecided
what
to
do
ashamed
of
being
thought
afraid
of
anything
maggot
at
last
cleared
his
throat
and
in
a
husky
voice
said
come
then
lev
us
go
down
so
saying
he
slid
down
the
shaft
closely
followed
by
tonkin
who
was
nearly
as
much
afraid
to
be
left
alone
on
the
bleak
moor
as
he
was
to
enter
the
old
mine
now
while
the
friends
were
consulting
with
palpitating
hearts
above
baby
maggot
and
trembling
with
terror
listened
with
bated
breath
below
and
when
the
two
men
came
scrambling
down
the
sides
of
the
shaft
his
heart
seemed
to
fill
up
his
breast
and
throat
and
his
blood
began
to
creep
in
his
veins
maggot
could
see
nothing
in
the
gloomy
interior
as
he
advanced
but
baby
could
see
his
father
dark
form
clearly
still
no
sound
escaped
from
him
for
horror
had
bereft
him
of
power
just
then
the
dark
cloud
passed
off
the
moon
and
a
bright
beam
shone
full
on
the
upper
half
of
the
baby
face
as
he
peeped
over
the
edge
of
one
of
the
tubs
maggot
saw
two
glaring
eyeballs
and
felt
frozen
alive
instantly
tonkin
looking
over
his
comrade
shoulder
also
saw
the
eyes
and
was
petrified
on
the
spot
suddenly
baby
maggot
found
his
voice
and
uttered
a
most
awful
yell
maggot
senior
found
his
limbs
and
turned
to
fly
so
did
tonkin
but
he
slipped
and
fell
at
the
first
step
maggot
fell
over
him
both
rose
and
dashed
up
the
shaft
scraping
elbows
shins
and
knuckles
as
they
went
and
followed
by
a
torrent
of
hideous
cries
that
sounded
in
their
ears
like
the
screaming
of
fiends
they
gained
the
surface
and
without
exchanging
a
word
fled
in
different
directions
on
the
wings
of
terror
maggot
did
not
halt
until
he
burst
into
his
house
and
flung
himself
into
his
own
chair
by
the
chimney
corner
whence
he
gazed
on
what
was
calculated
to
alarm
as
well
as
to
perplex
him
this
was
the
spectacle
of
his
own
wife
taking
tea
in
floods
of
tears
and
being
encouraged
in
her
difficult
task
by
mrs
penrose
and
a
few
sympathising
friends
with
some
difficulty
he
got
them
to
explain
this
mystery
what
baby
gone
lost
he
exclaimed
where
away
when
it
was
told
him
what
had
occurred
maggot
eyes
gradually
opened
and
his
lips
gradually
closed
until
the
latter
produced
a
low
whistle
i
think
that
i
do
knaw
where
the
cheeld
is
he
said
come
along
i
show
un
to
so
saying
the
wily
smith
assuming
an
air
of
importance
and
profound
wisdom
arose
and
led
his
wife
and
her
friends
with
a
large
band
of
men
who
had
prepared
torches
straight
to
the
old
shaft
going
down
but
sternly
forbidding
any
one
to
follow
he
speedily
returned
with
the
baby
in
his
arms
to
the
surprise
of
all
and
to
the
unutterable
joy
of
the
child
mother
in
one
sense
however
the
result
was
disastrous
curious
persons
were
there
who
could
not
rest
until
they
had
investigated
the
matter
further
and
the
tubs
were
not
only
discovered
but
carried
off
by
those
who
had
no
title
to
them
whatever
the
misfortune
created
such
a
tumult
of
indignation
in
the
breast
of
maggot
that
he
was
heard
in
his
wrath
to
declare
he
would
have
nothin
more
to
do
with
un
but
would
go
into
the
bal
the
next
settin
day
this
was
the
commencement
of
that
series
of
events
which
as
we
have
stated
at
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
were
brought
about
by
that
wonderful
baby
the
baby
maggot
chapter
twenty
eight
describes
at
the
mine
etcetera
that
very
evening
while
maggot
was
smoking
his
pipe
by
the
fireside
his
son
zackey
referred
to
the
bunch
of
copper
which
penrose
had
discovered
in
the
mine
after
a
short
conversation
maggot
senior
went
to
the
wounded
man
to
talk
about
it
was
a
keenly
lode
did
say
asked
maggot
after
he
had
inquired
as
to
the
health
of
his
friend
yes
and
as
i
shall
not
be
able
to
work
there
again
said
penrose
sadly
i
would
advise
you
to
try
it
zackey
is
entitled
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
discovery
for
he
was
with
me
at
the
time
and
but
for
his
aid
dear
boy
i
should
have
been
suffocated
maggot
said
no
more
on
that
occasion
about
the
mine
being
a
man
of
few
words
but
after
conversing
a
short
time
with
the
wounded
man
and
ascertaining
that
no
hope
was
held
out
to
him
of
the
recovery
of
his
sight
he
went
his
way
to
the
forge
to
work
and
meditate
came
being
the
first
saturday
in
the
month
and
no
work
was
done
on
that
day
in
botallack
for
the
men
were
all
above
ground
to
have
their
pitches
for
the
next
month
fixed
and
to
receive
their
wages
being
also
pay
day
some
time
before
the
business
of
the
day
commenced
the
miners
began
to
assemble
in
considerable
numbers
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
very
different
was
their
appearance
on
that
occasion
from
the
fellows
who
were
wont
to
toil
in
the
dark
chambers
far
down
in
the
depths
below
the
spot
where
they
stood
their
underground
dresses
were
laid
aside
and
they
now
appeared
in
the
costume
of
tradesmen
there
was
a
swing
about
the
movements
of
most
of
these
men
that
must
have
been
the
result
of
their
occupation
which
brings
every
muscle
of
the
body
into
play
and
does
not
as
is
too
much
the
case
in
some
trades
the
powers
of
a
certain
set
of
muscles
to
the
detriment
of
others
some
there
were
however
even
among
the
young
men
whose
hollow
cheeks
and
bloodless
lips
accompanied
with
a
short
cough
told
of
evil
resulting
from
bad
air
and
frequent
chills
while
on
the
other
hand
a
few
old
men
were
to
be
seen
with
bright
eyes
and
ruddy
cheeks
which
indicated
constitutions
of
iron
not
a
few
were
mere
lads
whose
broad
shoulders
and
deep
chests
and
resolute
wills
enabled
them
to
claim
the
title
and
do
the
work
of
men
there
were
some
among
them
both
young
and
old
who
showed
traces
of
having
suffered
in
their
dangerous
employment
several
were
minus
an
eye
and
one
or
two
were
nearly
blind
owing
to
exploding
in
their
faces
one
man
in
particular
a
tall
and
very
powerful
fellow
had
a
visage
which
was
quite
blue
and
one
of
his
eyes
was
closed
the
blue
colour
resulting
from
unburnt
grains
of
powder
having
been
blown
into
his
flesh
he
had
been
tattooed
in
fact
by
a
summary
and
effective
process
this
man
family
history
was
peculiar
his
father
also
a
miner
had
lived
in
a
lonely
cottage
on
a
moor
near
just
and
worked
in
balaswidden
mine
one
night
he
was
carried
home
and
laid
at
his
wife
feet
dead
almost
dashed
to
pieces
by
a
fall
not
long
afterwards
the
son
was
carried
to
the
same
cottage
with
his
right
eye
destroyed
some
time
later
a
brother
dislocated
his
foot
twice
within
the
year
in
the
mine
and
a
few
months
after
that
another
brother
fell
from
a
beam
descended
about
feet
perpendicularly
where
he
struck
the
side
of
the
mine
with
his
head
and
had
six
or
seven
of
his
teeth
knocked
out
glancing
off
to
one
side
he
fell
twenty
feet
more
on
the
hard
rock
where
he
was
picked
up
insensible
this
man
recovered
however
under
the
careful
nursing
of
his
oft
and
sorely
tried
mother
maggot
was
present
on
this
with
a
new
cap
and
a
new
blue
cloth
coat
looking
altogether
a
surprisingly
respectable
character
a
good
deal
of
undertoned
chaffing
commenced
when
he
appeared
hallo
exclaimed
one
goin
to
become
an
honest
man
maggot
thinkin

replied
the
smith
with
a
smile

was
agoin
to

the
smith
with
much
gravity

find
any
more
daws

the
other
with
a
leer
there
was
a
general
laugh
at
this
but

several
voices

the
way

said
billy
the
owld
gravedigger
in
cambourne

standin
about
after

away
so
that
he
cud

now
tom
i

lights
so
asked
the
captain
the
people
of
just
only

of
the
berryin
but
do
think
of
the
resurrection
the
consekince
is
that
they

too
deep
an
afore
the
just
folk
are
well
out
of
their
graves
will
be
a
braave
way
up
to
heaven
the
laugh
with
which
this
anecdote
was
received
had
scarcely
subsided
when
the
upper
half
of
one
of
the
windows
opened
and
the
head
and
shoulders
of
old
mr
cornish
appeared
the
manager
laid
an
open
book
on
the
and
from
this
elevated
position
as
from
a
pulpit
he
read
out
the
names
positions
etcetera
of
the
various
pitches
that
were
to
be
sett
for
the
following
month
one
of
the
mine
captains
stood
at
his
elbow
to
give
any
required
information
he
and
his
three
brother
captains
being
the
men
who
had
gone
all
over
the
mine
during
the
previous
month
examined
the
work
measured
what
had
been
done
by
each
man
or
pare
of
men
knew
the
capabilities
of
all
the
miners
and
fixed
the
portion
that
ought
to
be
offered
to
each
for
acceptance
or
refusal
the
men
assembled
in
a
cluster
round
the
window
and
looked
up
while
mr
cornish
read
off
as
follows
john
thomas
pitch
at
back
of
the
hundred
and
five
by
two
men
to
extend
from
the
end
of
four
fathom
west
and
from
back
of
level
five
fathom
above
for
the
enlightenment
of
the
reader
we
may
paraphrase
the
above
sentence
thus
the
pitch
or
portion
of
rock
wrought
last
month
by
john
thomas
is
now
offered
anew
in
the
first
place
to
john
thomas
himself
if
he
chooses
to
continue
working
it
at
our
rate
of
pay
or
if
he
declines
to
any
other
man
who
pleases
to
offer
for
it
the
pitch
is
in
the
back
or
roof
of
the
level
which
lies
one
hundred
and
five
fathoms
deep
it
must
be
wrought
by
two
men
and
must
be
excavated
lengthwise
to
an
extent
of
four
fathoms
in
a
westerly
direction
from
a
spot
called
the
in
an
upward
direction
it
may
be
excavated
from
the
roof
of
the
level
to
an
extent
of
five
fathoms
john
thomas
being
present
at
once
offered
ten
shillings
by
which
he
meant
that
knowing
the
labour
to
be
undergone
and
the
probable
value
of
the
ore
that
would
have
to
be
excavated
he
thought
it
worth
while
to
continue
at
that
piece
of
work
or
that
pitch
if
the
manager
would
give
him
ten
shillings
for
every
twenty
shillings
worth
of
mineral
sent
to
the
surface
by
him
but
the
captain
also
knew
the
ground
and
the
labour
that
would
be
required
and
his
estimate
was
that
eight
shillings
would
be
quite
sufficient
remuneration
a
fact
which
was
announced
by
mr
cornish
simply
uttering
the
words
at
eight
shillings
put
her
down
said
john
thomas
after
a
moment
consideration
perhaps
john
knew
that
eight
shillings
was
really
sufficient
although
he
wanted
ten
at
all
events
he
knew
that
it
was
against
the
rules
to
dispute
the
point
at
that
time
as
it
delayed
business
that
if
he
did
not
accept
the
offer
another
man
might
do
so
and
that
he
might
not
get
so
good
a
pitch
if
he
were
to
change
the
pitch
was
therefore
sett
to
john
thomas
and
another
read
off
jim
hocking
pitch
at
back
of
the
hundred
and
ten
by
one
man
to
extend
etcetera
wo
have
nothin
to
do
with
her
said
jim
hocking
jim
had
evidently
found
the
work
too
hard
and
was
dissatisfied
with
the
remuneration
so
he
declined
resolving
to
try
his
chance
in
a
more
promising
part
of
the
mine
will
any
one
offer
for
this
pitch
inquired
mr
cornish
eight
and
six
shillings
were
sums
immediately
named
by
men
who
thought
the
pitch
looked
more
promising
than
jim
did
any
one
offer
more
for
this
pitch
asked
the
manager
taking
up
a
pebble
from
a
little
pile
that
lay
at
his
elbow
and
casting
it
into
the
air
while
that
pebble
was
in
its
flight
any
one
might
offer
for
the
pitch
but
the
instant
it
touched
the
ground
the
bargain
was
held
to
be
concluded
with
the
last
bidder
a
man
named
oats
who
had
been
in
a
hesitating
state
of
mind
here
exclaimed
five
shillings
that
is
offered
to
work
the
pitch
for
five
shillings
on
every
twenty
shillings
worth
sent
to
grass
next
instant
the
stone
fell
and
the
pitch
was
sett
to
oats
poor
james
penrose
pitch
was
the
next
sett
james
penrose
pitch
read
the
manager
giving
the
details
of
it
in
terms
somewhat
similar
to
those
already
sett
and
stating
that
the
required
pare
or
force
to
be
put
on
it
was
two
men
and
a
boy
put
me
down
for
it
said
maggot
have
you
got
your
pare
asked
mr
cornish
iss
sur
their
names
david
trevarrow
and
my
son
zackey
the
pitch
was
allocated
in
due
form
at
the
rate
of
fifteen
shillings
per
twenty
shillings
worth
of
mineral
sent
up
this
large
sum
being
given
because
it
was
not
known
to
be
an
unusually
good
pitch
penrose
having
been
too
ill
to
speak
of
his
discovery
since
his
accident
and
the
captain
having
failed
to
notice
it
when
a
place
is
poor
looking
a
higher
sum
is
given
to
the
miner
to
induce
him
to
work
it
when
it
is
rich
a
lower
sum
is
given
because
he
can
make
more
out
of
it
thus
the
work
went
on
the
sums
named
varying
according
to
the
nature
of
the
ground
and
each
man
saying
naw
or
put
me
down
or
that
do
or
i
wo
have
her
according
to
circumstances
while
this
was
going
on
at
the
window
another
and
perhaps
more
interesting
scene
was
taking
place
in
the
office
this
apartment
presented
a
singular
appearances
there
was
a
large
table
in
the
centre
of
it
which
with
every
available
inch
of
surface
on
a
and
on
a
board
at
the
window
was
completely
covered
with
banknotes
and
piles
of
gold
silver
and
copper
each
pile
was
placed
on
a
little
square
piece
of
paper
containing
the
for
the
month
of
the
man
or
men
to
whom
it
belonged
very
few
men
laboured
singly
many
worked
in
couples
and
some
in
bands
of
three
five
or
more
so
much
hard
cash
gave
the
place
a
wealthy
appearance
and
in
truth
there
was
a
goodly
sum
spread
out
amounting
to
several
hundreds
of
pounds
the
piles
varied
very
much
in
size
and
conveyed
a
rough
outline
of
the
financial
history
of
the
men
they
belonged
to
some
large
heaps
of
silver
with
a
few
coppers
and
a
pile
of
sovereigns
more
than
an
inch
high
lying
on
two
or
more
notes
indicated
successful
labour
nevertheless
the
evidence
was
not
absolutely
conclusive
because
the
large
piles
had
in
most
cases
to
be
divided
between
several
men
who
had
banded
together
but
the
little
square
with
a
couple
of
crowns
on
them
told
of
hard
work
and
little
pay
while
yonder
square
with
two
shillings
in
the
centre
of
it
betokened
utter
failure
only
to
be
excelled
by
another
square
on
which
lay
you
will
probably
exclaim
in
your
heart
reader
what
do
miners
sometimes
work
for
a
month
and
receive
only
two
shillings
or
as
wages
ay
sometimes
but
it
is
their
own
seeking
if
they
do
it
is
not
forced
upon
them
there
are
three
classes
of
miners
those
who
work
on
the
surface
dressing
ore
etcetera
who
are
paid
a
weekly
wage
those
who
work
on
tribute
and
those
who
work
at
of
the
first
we
say
nothing
except
that
they
consist
chiefly
of
balmaidens
and
children
the
former
receiving
about
shillings
a
month
and
the
latter
from
shillings
to
shillings
according
to
age
and
capacity
in
regard
to
tributers
and
we
may
remark
that
the
work
of
both
is
identical
in
one
respect
namely
that
of
hewing
picking
boring
and
blasting
the
hard
rock
in
this
matter
they
share
equal
toils
and
dangers
but
they
are
not
subjected
to
the
same
remunerative
vicissitudes
when
a
man
works
on
tribute
he
receives
so
many
shillings
for
every
twenty
shillings
worth
of
ore
that
he
raises
during
the
month
as
already
explained
if
his
pitch
turns
out
to
be
rich
in
ore
his
earnings
are
proportionably
high
if
it
be
poor
he
remains
poor
also
sometimes
a
part
of
the
mineral
lode
becomes
so
poor
that
it
will
not
pay
for
working
and
has
to
be
abandoned
so
little
as
a
shilling
may
be
the
result
of
a
tributer
work
for
a
month
at
one
time
while
at
another
time
he
may
get
a
good
pitch
and
make
pounds
or
pounds
in
the
same
period
the
tutman
or
piecework
man
on
the
other
hand
cuts
out
the
rock
at
so
much
per
fathom
and
obtains
wages
at
the
rate
of
from
pounds
shillings
to
pounds
a
month
he
can
never
hope
to
make
a
fortune
but
so
long
as
health
and
strength
last
he
may
count
on
steady
work
and
wages
of
course
there
is
a
great
deal
of
the
work
in
a
mine
which
is
not
directly
remunerative
such
as
sinking
shafts
opening
up
and
driving
or
lengthening
levels
and
sinking
winzes
on
such
work
tutmen
are
employed
the
man
who
works
on
tribute
is
a
speculator
he
who
chooses
is
a
steady
labourer
the
tributer
experiences
all
the
excitement
of
uncertainty
and
enjoys
the
pleasures
of
hope
he
knows
something
too
about
hope
deferred
also
can
tell
of
hope
disappointed
has
his
wits
sharpened
and
generally
is
a
smart
fellow
the
knows
nothing
of
this
his
pay
being
safe
and
regular
though
small
many
plodding
men
prefer
and
stick
to
in
and
about
the
the
men
who
had
settled
the
matter
of
their
next
month
work
were
assembled
these
the
cashier
having
previously
made
all
ready
were
paid
in
a
prompt
and
businesslike
manner
first
there
came
forward
a
man
it
was
scarcely
necessary
for
him
to
speak
for
the
cashier
knew
every
man
on
the
mine
by
name
and
also
how
much
was
due
to
him
and
the
hundreds
of
little
square
were
so
arranged
that
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
any
one
in
an
instant
nevertheless
being
a
hearty
and
amiable
man
he
generally
had
a
word
to
say
to
every
one
how
your
son
matthew
he
inquired
of
the
man
putting
the
square
paper
with
its
contents
into
his
hand
he
braave
sir
the
doctor
do
say
he
be
about
again
in
a
week
matthew
crumpled
up
his
notes
gold
silver
copper
and
all
in
his
huge
brown
hand
and
thrusting
the
whole
into
his
breeches
pocket
said
thank
and
walked
away
next
there
came
forward
a
young
man
with
one
eye
an
explosion
having
shut
up
the
other
one
for
ever
he
received
his
money
along
with
that
of
the
three
men
who
worked
in
the
same
pare
with
him
he
crumpled
it
up
in
the
same
reckless
way
as
matthew
had
done
also
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
and
walked
off
with
an
independent
swagger
truly
in
the
sweat
not
only
of
his
brow
but
of
every
pore
in
his
body
had
he
earned
it
and
he
was
entitled
to
swagger
a
little
just
then
there
was
little
enough
room
or
inducement
to
do
so
down
in
the
mine
after
this
young
man
a
little
boy
came
forward
saying
that
his
faither
had
sent
him
for
his
money
it
was
observable
that
the
boys
and
lads
among
those
who
presented
themselves
in
the
were
as
a
rule
hearty
and
hopeful
with
them
it
was
as
with
the
young
in
all
walks
of
life
everything
looked
bright
and
promising
the
young
men
were
stern
yet
as
though
they
had
already
found
life
a
pretty
tough
battle
but
felt
quite
equal
to
it
and
so
they
were
every
one
of
them
with
tough
sinews
hard
muscles
and
indomitable
energy
they
were
assuredly
equal
to
any
work
that
man
could
undertake
and
many
of
them
having
the
fear
of
god
in
their
hearts
were
fitted
to
endure
manfully
the
trials
of
life
as
well
the
elderly
men
were
sedate
and
had
careworn
faces
they
knew
what
it
was
to
suffer
many
of
them
had
carried
little
ones
to
the
grave
they
had
often
seen
strong
men
like
themselves
go
forth
in
the
morning
hale
and
hearty
and
be
carried
to
their
homes
at
evening
with
blinded
eyes
or
shattered
limbs
life
had
lost
its
gloss
to
them
but
it
had
not
lost
its
charms
there
were
loving
hearts
to
work
for
and
a
glorious
end
for
which
to
live
or
if
need
be
to
die
so
although
their
countenances
were
sedate
they
were
not
sad
the
old
men
of
whom
there
were
but
two
or
three
were
jolly
old
souls
they
seemed
to
have
successfully
defied
the
tear
and
wear
of
life
to
have
outlived
its
sorrows
and
renewed
their
youth
certainly
they
had
not
reached
their
second
childhood
for
they
stepped
forth
and
held
out
their
hands
for
their
pay
as
steadily
as
the
best
of
the
young
ones
when
about
of
the
number
had
been
paid
a
woman
in
weeds
came
forward
to
take
up
the
pay
due
to
her
son
her
wretched
harry
as
she
styled
him
all
that
was
due
was
it
was
inexpressibly
sad
to
see
her
retire
with
this
small
sum
the
last
that
her
unsettled
boy
was
entitled
to
draw
from
the
mines
he
had
worked
previously
in
the
neighbouring
mine
wheal
owles
and
had
gone
to
botallack
the
month
before
he
was
now
off
to
sea
leaving
his
mother
who
to
some
extent
depended
on
him
to
look
out
for
herself
the
next
who
came
forward
was
a
blind
man
he
had
worked
long
in
the
mine
so
long
that
he
could
find
his
way
through
the
labyrinth
of
levels
as
easily
in
his
blind
state
as
he
did
formerly
with
his
eyesight
when
his
eyes
were
destroyed
in
the
usual
way
by
the
explosion
of
a
hole
he
was
only
off
work
during
the
period
of
convalescence
afterwards
he
returned
to
his
familiar
haunts
underground
and
although
he
could
no
longer
labour
in
the
old
way
he
was
quite
able
to
work
a
windlass
and
draw
up
the
bucket
at
a
winze
for
this
he
now
pocketed
two
pounds
sterling
and
walked
off
as
vigorously
as
if
he
had
possessed
both
his
eyes
among
others
a
wife
appeared
to
claim
her
husband
pay
and
she
was
followed
by
zackey
maggot
who
came
to
receive
his
own
and
money
how
does
penrose
get
on
inquired
the
cashier
as
he
handed
over
the
sum
due
slowly
sur
said
zackey
it
is
a
bad
case
said
one
of
the
captains
who
sat
close
by
the
doctor
thinks
there
is
little
or
no
chance
for
his
eyesight
poor
zackey
received
his
pay
and
retired
without
any
demonstration
of
his
wonted
buoyancy
of
spirit
for
he
was
fond
of
penrose
almost
as
much
so
as
he
was
of
uncle
david
trevarrow
the
varied
fortune
experienced
in
the
mine
was
exhibited
in
one
or
two
instances
on
this
occasion
one
man
and
a
boy
working
together
had
in
their
own
phraseology
got
a
sturt
they
had
come
unexpectedly
on
a
piece
of
rich
ground
which
yielded
so
much
tin
that
at
the
end
of
the
month
they
received
pounds
between
them
the
man
had
been
receiving
subsist
that
is
drawing
advances
monthly
for
nearly
a
year
and
having
a
wife
and
children
to
support
had
almost
lost
heart
it
was
said
that
he
had
even
contemplated
suicide
but
this
little
piece
of
good
fortune
enabled
him
to
pay
off
his
debt
and
left
something
over
another
man
and
boy
had
pounds
to
receive
on
the
other
hand
one
man
had
only
shillings
due
to
him
while
a
couple
of
men
who
had
worked
in
poor
ground
found
themselves
shillings
in
debt
and
had
to
ask
for
subsist
some
time
previous
to
this
two
men
had
discovered
a
bunch
of
copper
and
in
the
course
of
two
months
they
cleared
pounds
at
a
later
period
a
man
in
levant
mine
who
was
one
of
the
wesleyan
local
preachers
cleared
pounds
within
a
year
he
gave
a
hundred
pounds
to
his
mother
and
with
the
other
hundred
went
off
to
seek
his
fortune
in
australia
after
all
the
men
had
been
paid
those
who
wished
for
subsist
or
advances
were
desired
to
come
forward
about
a
dozen
of
them
did
so
and
among
these
were
representatives
of
all
classes
the
diligent
and
strong
the
old
and
feeble
and
the
young
of
course
in
mining
operations
as
in
other
work
the
weak
lazy
and
idle
will
ever
be
up
to
the
lips
in
trouble
and
in
need
of
help
but
in
mining
the
best
of
men
may
be
obliged
to
demand
assistance
because
when
tributers
work
on
hopefully
day
after
day
and
week
after
week
on
bad
ground
they
must
have
advances
to
enable
them
to
persevere
not
being
able
to
subsist
on
air
this
is
no
hardship
the
mine
being
at
all
times
open
to
their
inspection
and
they
are
allowed
to
select
their
own
ground
hence
the
demand
for
subsist
is
not
necessarily
a
sign
of
absolute
but
only
of
temporary
poverty
the
managers
make
large
or
small
advances
according
to
their
knowledge
of
the
men
there
was
a
good
deal
of
chaffing
at
this
point
in
the
proceedings
the
lazy
men
giving
occasion
for
a
slight
administration
of
rebuke
and
the
able
men
affording
scope
for
pleasantry
and
badinage
in
botallack
at
the
present
time
about
forty
or
fifty
men
per
month
find
it
necessary
to
ask
for
subsist
before
the
wages
were
paid
several
small
deductions
had
to
be
made
first
there
was
sixpence
to
be
deducted
from
each
man
for
the
club
this
club
consisted
of
those
who
chose
to
pay
sixpence
a
month
to
a
fund
for
the
temporary
support
of
those
who
were
damaged
by
accidents
in
the
mine
a
similar
sum
per
month
was
deducted
from
each
man
for
the
doctor
who
was
bound
in
consideration
of
this
to
attend
the
miners
free
of
charge
in
addition
to
this
a
shilling
was
deducted
from
each
man
to
be
given
to
the
widow
and
family
of
a
comrade
who
had
died
that
month
at
the
present
time
from
pounds
to
pounds
are
raised
in
this
way
when
a
death
occurs
to
be
given
to
the
friends
of
the
deceased
it
should
be
remarked
that
these
deductions
are
made
with
the
consent
of
the
men
any
one
may
refuse
to
give
to
those
objects
but
if
he
do
so
he
or
his
will
lose
the
benefit
in
the
event
of
his
disablement
or
death
men
who
are
totally
disabled
receive
a
pension
from
the
club
fund
not
long
ago
a
miner
blind
of
one
eye
left
another
mine
and
engaged
in
botallack
before
his
first
month
was
out
he
exploded
a
in
his
face
which
destroyed
the
other
eye
from
that
day
he
received
a
pension
of
pound
a
month
which
will
continue
till
his
death
or
at
least
as
long
as
botallack
shall
flourish
and
that
miner
may
be
seen
daily
going
through
the
streets
of
just
with
his
little
daughter
in
a
cart
shouting
pilchards
fresh
breem
pullock
fresh
pullock
at
the
top
of
his
stentorian
voice
a
living
example
of
the
value
of
the
club
and
of
the
principle
of
insurance
at
length
the
business
of
the
day
came
to
a
close
the
wages
were
paid
the
men
work
for
another
month
was
fixed
the
cases
of
difficulty
and
distress
were
heard
and
alleviated
and
then
the
managers
and
agents
wound
up
the
day
by
dining
together
in
the
the
most
noteworthy
point
in
the
event
being
the
fact
that
the
dinner
was
eaten
off
plates
made
of
pure
botallack
tin
once
a
quarter
this
dinner
styled
the
is
partaken
of
by
any
of
the
shareholders
who
may
wish
to
be
present
on
which
occasion
the
manager
and
agents
lay
before
the
company
the
condition
and
prospects
of
the
mine
and
a
quarterly
dividend
if
any
is
paid
there
is
a
and
air
about
this
feast
which
commands
respect
the
room
in
which
it
is
held
is
uncarpeted
and
its
walls
are
graced
by
no
higher
works
of
art
than
the
plans
and
sections
of
the
mine
the
food
is
excellent
and
substantial
but
simple
there
is
abundance
of
it
but
there
are
no
courses
either
preliminary
or
successive
no
soup
or
fish
to
annoy
one
who
wants
meat
no
ridiculous
to
tantalise
one
who
wants
something
solid
no
puddings
pies
or
tarts
to
tempt
men
to
gluttony
all
set
to
work
at
the
same
time
and
enjoy
their
meal
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
of
most
dinners
all
is
grandly
simple
like
the
celebrated
mine
on
which
the
whole
is
founded
but
there
is
one
luxury
at
this
feast
which
it
would
be
unpardonable
not
to
mention
namely
the
punch
whoever
tastes
this
beverage
can
never
forget
it
description
were
useless
to
convey
an
idea
of
it
imagination
were
impotent
to
form
a
conception
of
it
taste
alone
will
avail
so
that
our
readers
must
either
go
to
cornwall
to
drink
it
or
for
ever
remain
unsatisfied
we
can
only
remark
in
reference
to
it
that
it
is
potent
as
well
as
pleasant
and
that
it
is
also
dangerous
being
of
an
insinuating
nature
so
that
those
who
partake
freely
have
a
tendency
to
wish
for
more
and
are
apt
to
dream
not
unreasonably
but
too
wildly
of
botallack
tin
being
transformed
into
silver
and
gold
chapter
twenty
nine
details
among
other
things
a
deed
of
heroism
to
work
went
maggot
and
trevarrow
and
zackey
on
their
new
pitch
next
day
like
true
britons
indeed
we
question
whether
true
britons
of
the
ancient
time
ever
did
go
to
work
with
half
the
energy
or
perseverance
of
the
men
of
the
present
day
those
men
of
old
were
mere
grubbers
on
the
surface
they
knew
nothing
of
deep
levels
under
the
ocean
however
to
do
them
justice
they
made
wonderfully
extensive
tunnels
in
mother
earth
with
implements
much
inferior
to
those
now
in
use
but
be
that
as
it
may
our
trio
went
to
work
with
a
will
maggot
was
keen
to
get
up
as
much
of
the
rich
mineral
as
possible
during
the
month
knowing
that
he
would
not
get
the
place
next
month
on
such
good
terms
trevarrow
besides
having
no
objections
to
make
money
when
he
could
for
its
own
sake
was
anxious
to
have
a
little
to
spare
to
james
penrose
whose
large
family
found
it
pinching
work
to
subsist
on
the
poor
fellow
allowance
from
the
club
as
to
zackey
he
was
ready
for
anything
where
uncle
davy
was
leader
so
these
three
resolved
to
work
night
and
day
maggot
took
his
turn
in
the
daytime
and
slept
at
night
trevarrow
slept
in
the
daytime
and
worked
at
night
while
the
boy
worked
as
long
as
he
could
at
whatever
time
suited
him
best
as
they
advanced
on
the
lode
it
became
larger
and
richer
and
in
a
day
or
two
it
assumed
such
proportions
as
to
throw
the
fortunate
workers
into
a
state
of
great
excitement
and
they
tore
out
and
blasted
away
the
precious
mineral
like
titans
one
day
about
having
fired
two
holes
they
came
out
of
the
end
in
which
they
wrought
and
sat
down
to
lunch
while
the
smoke
was
clearing
away
a
brave
lode
said
maggot
it
is
responded
trevarrow
taking
a
long
draught
of
water
from
the
canteen
what
shall
us
do
said
maggot
go
to
grass
to
slaip
or
slaip
in
the
bal
in
the
bal
if
you
do
like
it
said
trevarrow
so
it
was
agreed
that
the
men
should
sleep
in
the
mine
on
boards
or
on
any
dry
part
of
the
level
in
order
to
save
the
time
and
energy
lost
in
ascending
and
descending
the
long
ladders
and
thus
make
the
most
of
their
opportunity
it
was
further
resolved
that
zackey
should
be
sent
up
for
dry
clothes
and
bring
them
their
meals
regularly
trevarrow
did
not
forget
to
have
his
bible
brought
to
him
for
he
was
too
serious
a
man
to
shut
his
eyes
to
the
danger
of
a
sudden
run
of
good
fortune
and
thought
that
the
best
way
to
guard
against
evil
would
be
to
devote
nearly
all
his
short
periods
of
leisure
time
to
the
reading
of
the
word
you
may
be
sure
that
maggot
afterwards
laughed
at
him
for
this
but
he
did
not
concern
himself
much
about
it
at
the
time
because
he
was
usually
too
hungry
to
talk
at
and
too
sleepy
to
do
so
after
work
was
over
they
were
still
busily
discussing
the
matter
of
remaining
in
the
mine
all
night
when
they
heard
the
kibble
descending
the
shaft
near
the
bottom
of
which
they
sat
and
next
moment
a
man
came
to
the
ground
with
considerable
violence
why
frankey
is
that
thee
booy
said
maggot
starting
up
to
assist
him
aw
dear
iss
i
gone
dead
aw
dear
aw
dear
why
whatever
brought
here
said
trevarrow
the
kibble
sure
replied
the
man
exhibiting
his
knuckles
which
were
cut
and
bleeding
a
good
deal
i
did
come
by
the
chain
anyhow
this
was
indeed
true
frankey
as
his
mates
called
him
was
at
that
time
the
lander
in
charge
of
the
kibbles
at
the
surface
it
was
his
duty
to
receive
each
kibble
as
it
was
drawn
up
to
the
mouth
of
the
shaft
full
of
ore
empty
it
and
send
it
down
again
several
coils
of
chain
passing
round
the
large
drum
of
a
great
called
by
the
miners
a
whim
was
the
means
by
which
the
kibbles
were
hoisted
and
lowered
the
chain
was
so
arranged
that
one
kibble
was
lowered
by
it
while
the
other
was
being
drawn
up
frankey
had
emptied
one
of
the
kibbles
and
had
given
the
signal
to
the
boy
attending
the
horse
to
lower
away
when
he
inadvertently
stepped
into
the
shaft
with
ready
presence
of
mind
the
man
caught
the
chain
and
clung
to
it
but
the
boy
being
prevented
by
a
pile
of
rubbish
from
seeing
what
had
occurred
eased
him
down
supposing
him
to
be
the
kibble
this
easing
down
a
great
number
of
fathoms
was
by
no
means
an
easy
process
as
those
know
well
who
have
seen
a
pair
of
kibbles
go
banging
up
and
down
a
shaft
it
was
all
that
poor
frankey
could
do
to
keep
his
head
from
being
smashed
against
rocks
and
beams
but
by
energetic
use
of
arms
and
legs
he
did
so
and
reached
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
without
further
damage
than
a
little
skin
rubbed
off
his
knees
and
elbows
and
a
few
cuts
on
his
hands
the
man
thought
so
little
of
it
indeed
that
he
at
once
returned
to
grass
by
the
to
the
unutterable
surprise
and
no
little
consternation
of
the
boy
who
had
eased
him
down
the
air
at
the
end
of
the
level
in
which
maggot
and
trevarrow
worked
was
very
bad
and
for
some
time
past
men
had
been
engaged
in
sinking
a
winze
from
the
level
above
to
connect
the
two
and
send
in
a
supply
of
fresh
air
by
creating
a
new
channel
of
circulation
this
winze
was
almost
completed
but
one
of
the
men
employed
at
it
had
suddenly
become
unwell
that
day
and
no
other
had
been
appointed
to
the
work
as
it
was
a
matter
of
great
importance
to
have
fresh
air
now
that
they
had
resolved
to
remain
day
and
night
in
the
mine
for
some
time
maggot
and
trevarrow
determined
to
complete
the
work
believing
that
one
or
two
shots
would
do
it
accordingly
they
mounted
to
the
level
above
and
were
lowered
one
at
a
time
to
the
bottom
of
the
unfinished
winze
by
a
windlass
which
was
turned
by
the
man
whose
comrade
had
become
unwell
for
nearly
two
hours
they
laboured
diligently
scarce
taking
time
to
wipe
the
perspiration
from
their
heated
brows
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
hole
was
sufficiently
deep
to
blast
so
maggot
called
out
zackey
my
son
fetch
the
fuse
and
powder
the
boy
was
quickly
lowered
with
these
materials
and
then
drawn
up
meanwhile
maggot
proceeded
to
charge
the
hole
and
his
comrade
sat
down
to
rest
he
put
in
the
powder
and
tamping
and
asked
the
other
to
hand
him
the
zackey
has
forgot
it
said
trevarrow
looking
round
it
do
matter
hand
me
the
borer
no
i
wo
said
trevarrow
decidedly
as
he
grasped
the
iron
tool
in
question
ho
zackey
booy
throw
down
the
this
was
done
and
the
operation
of
filling
the
hole
continued
while
trevarrow
commented
somewhat
severely
on
his
companion
recklessness
that
just
how
the
most
o
the
reckless
men
in
the
bal
do
get
up
he
said
they
always
picking
away
at
the
holes
and
tamping
with
iron
tools
why
thee
might
as
well
put
a
lighted
match
down
the
muzzle
of
a
loaded
gun
as
tamp
with
an
iron
borer
come
now
said
maggot
looking
up
from
his
work
with
a
leer
it
war
that
as
made
old
kimber
nearly
blow
hisself
up
last
week
no
but
it
was
carelessness
anyhow
retorted
trevarrow
and
lucky
for
him
that
he
was
a
smart
man
else
he
bin
gone
dead
by
this
time
maggot
soon
completed
the
filling
of
the
hole
and
then
perpetrated
as
reckless
a
deed
as
any
of
his
mining
comrades
had
ever
been
guilty
of
trevarrow
was
preparing
to
ascend
by
the
windlass
intending
to
leave
his
comrade
to
light
the
fuse
and
come
up
after
him
meanwhile
maggot
found
that
the
fuse
was
too
long
he
discovered
this
after
it
was
fixed
in
the
hole
and
unobserved
by
his
companion
proceeded
to
cut
it
by
means
of
an
iron
tool
and
a
flat
stone
fire
was
struck
at
the
last
blow
by
the
meeting
of
the
iron
and
the
stone
and
the
fuse
ignited
to
extinguish
it
was
impossible
to
cut
it
in
the
same
way
without
striking
fire
was
equally
so
of
course
there
was
plenty
of
time
to
ascend
by
the
windlass
but
at
a
time
could
do
so
the
men
knew
this
and
looked
at
each
other
with
terrible
meaning
in
their
eyes
as
they
rushed
at
the
bucket
and
shouted
to
the
man
above
to
haul
them
up
he
attempted
to
do
so
but
in
vain
he
had
not
strength
to
haul
up
two
at
once
one
could
escape
both
could
not
and
to
delay
would
be
death
to
both
in
this
extremity
david
trevarrow
looked
at
his
comrade
and
said
calmly
escape
my
brother
a
minute
more
and
i
shall
be
in
heaven
he
stepped
back
while
he
spoke
the
bucket
went
rapidly
upwards
and
trevarrow
sitting
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
covered
his
eyes
with
a
piece
of
rock
and
awaited
the
issue
the
rumbling
explosion
immediately
followed
and
the
shaft
was
filled
with
smoke
and
flame
and
hurling
stones
one
of
these
latter
shooting
upwards
struck
and
cut
the
ascending
miner
on
his
forehead
as
he
looked
down
to
observe
the
fate
of
his
comrade
maggot
was
saved
but
he
was
of
too
bold
and
kindly
a
nature
to
remain
for
a
moment
inactive
after
the
explosion
was
over
at
once
he
descended
and
groping
about
among
the
debris
soon
found
his
friend
alive
and
almost
unhurt
a
mass
of
rock
had
arched
him
over
or
rather
the
hand
of
god
as
if
by
miracle
had
delivered
the
christian
miner
after
he
was
got
up
in
safety
to
the
level
above
they
asked
him
why
he
had
been
so
ready
to
give
up
his
life
to
save
his
friend
why
said
david
quietly
i
did
think
upon
his
wife
and
the
and
little
grace
seemed
to
say
to
me
care
o
faither
besides
there
are
none
to
weep
if
i
was
taken
away
so
the
lord
gave
me
grace
to
do
it
that
night
there
were
glad
and
grateful
hearts
in
maggot
cottage
and
never
in
this
world
was
a
more
flat
and
emphatic
contradiction
given
to
any
statement
than
that
which
was
given
to
david
assertion
there
are
none
to
weep
if
i
was
taken
away
a
short
but
beautiful
account
of
the
above
incident
will
be
found
in
a
little
volume
of
poems
entitled
from
the
mine
the
moor
and
the
written
by
john
harris
a
cornish
miner
chapter
thirty
reveals
some
astonishing
facts
and
their
consequences
sorrow
and
trouble
now
began
to
descend
upon
mr
thomas
donnithorne
like
a
thick
cloud
reduced
from
a
state
of
affluence
to
one
bordering
on
absolute
poverty
the
old
man
naturally
buoyant
spirit
almost
gave
way
and
it
needed
all
the
attentions
and
the
cheering
influence
of
his
good
wife
and
sweet
rose
ellis
to
keep
him
from
going
as
he
often
threatened
to
the
end
of
cape
cornwall
and
jumping
into
the
sea
it
all
over
with
me
oliver
said
he
one
morning
after
the
return
of
his
nephew
from
london
a
young
fellow
like
you
may
face
up
against
such
difficulties
but
what
is
an
old
man
to
do
i
ca
begin
the
world
over
again
and
as
for
the
shares
i
have
in
the
various
mines
they
not
worth
the
paper
they
writ
upon
but
things
may
take
a
turn
suggested
oliver
this
is
not
the
first
time
the
mines
have
been
in
a
poor
condition
and
the
price
of
tin
low
when
things
get
very
bad
they
are
likely
to
get
better
you
know
even
now
there
seems
to
be
some
talk
among
the
miners
of
an
improved
state
of
things
i
met
maggot
yesterday
and
he
was
boasting
of
having
found
a
monstrous
bunch
which
according
to
him
is
to
be
the
making
of
all
our
fortunes
mr
donnithorne
shook
his
head
maggot
geese
are
always
swans
he
said
no
no
oliver
i
have
lost
all
hope
of
improvement
there
are
so
many
of
these
deceptive
mines
around
us
just
now
some
already
gone
down
and
some
going
that
the
public
are
losing
confidence
in
us
and
somewhat
unfairly
judging
that
because
a
few
among
us
are
scoundrels
we
are
altogether
a
bad
lot
what
do
you
think
of
mr
clearemout
new
mine
asked
oliver
i
believe
it
to
be
a
genuine
one
said
the
old
gentleman
turning
a
somewhat
sharp
glance
on
his
nephew
why
do
you
ask
because
i
doubt
it
replied
oliver
you
are
too
sceptical
said
mr
donnithorne
almost
testily
too
much
given
to
judging
things
at
first
sight
nay
uncle
you
are
unfair
had
i
judged
of
you
at
first
sight
i
should
have
thought
you
a
well
what
a
smuggling
old
rascal
eh
and
not
far
wrong
after
all
at
all
events
said
oliver
laughing
i
have
lived
to
form
a
better
opinion
of
you
than
that
but
in
reference
to
clearemout
i
can
not
shut
my
eyes
to
the
fact
that
the
work
doing
at
the
new
mine
is
very
like
a
sham
for
they
have
only
two
men
and
a
boy
working
her
with
a
captain
to
superintend
and
it
is
said
for
i
made
inquiries
while
in
london
that
thirty
thousand
pounds
have
been
called
up
from
the
shareholders
and
there
are
several
highly
paid
directors
with
an
in
the
city
drawing
large
salaries
nonsense
oliver
said
mr
donnithorne
more
testily
than
before
you
know
very
well
that
things
must
have
a
beginning
and
that
caution
is
necessary
at
first
in
all
speculations
besides
i
feel
convinced
that
mr
clearemout
is
a
most
respectable
man
and
an
uncommonly
clever
fellow
to
boot
it
is
quite
plain
that
you
do
like
him
that
what
prejudices
you
oliver
you
jealous
of
the
impression
he
has
made
on
the
people
here
this
last
remark
was
made
jestingly
but
it
caused
the
young
doctor
to
wince
having
hit
nearer
the
truth
than
the
old
gentleman
had
any
idea
of
for
although
oliver
envied
not
the
handsome
stranger
popularity
he
was
almost
unknown
to
himself
very
jealous
of
the
impression
he
seemed
to
have
made
on
rose
ellis
a
feeling
of
shame
induced
him
to
change
the
subject
of
conversation
with
a
laughing
observation
that
he
hoped
such
an
unworthy
motive
did
not
influence
him
now
while
this
conversation
was
going
on
in
the
parlour
of
mr
donnithorne
cottage
another
dialogue
was
taking
place
in
a
small
wooden
erection
at
the
end
of
the
garden
which
bore
the
dignified
name
of
rose
bower
the
parties
concerned
in
it
were
george
augustus
clearemout
and
rose
ellis
a
day
or
two
previous
to
the
conversation
to
which
we
are
about
to
draw
attention
the
managing
director
had
undergone
a
change
in
his
sentiments
and
intentions
when
he
first
saw
rose
he
thought
her
an
uncommonly
sweet
and
pretty
girl
a
short
acquaintance
with
her
convinced
him
that
she
was
even
sweeter
and
prettier
than
at
first
he
had
thought
her
this
coupled
with
the
discovery
that
her
uncle
was
very
rich
and
that
he
meant
to
leave
a
large
portion
of
his
wealth
if
not
all
of
it
to
rose
decided
clearemout
and
he
resolved
to
marry
her
afterwards
he
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
old
mr
donnithorne
had
met
with
losses
but
he
was
ignorant
of
their
extent
and
still
deemed
it
worth
while
to
carry
out
his
intentions
george
augustus
had
been
a
managing
director
in
various
ways
from
his
earliest
infancy
and
had
never
experienced
much
opposition
to
his
will
so
that
he
had
acquired
a
habit
of
settling
in
his
own
mind
whatever
he
meant
to
do
and
forthwith
doing
it
on
this
occasion
he
resolved
to
sacrifice
himself
to
rose
in
consideration
of
her
prospective
fortune
cash
being
of
course
mr
clearemout
god
great
then
was
the
managing
director
surprise
and
astonishing
the
condition
of
his
feelings
when
on
venturing
to
express
his
wishes
to
rose
he
was
kindly
but
firmly
rejected
mr
clearemout
was
so
thunderstruck
having
construed
the
unsophisticated
girl
candour
and
simplicity
of
manner
into
direct
encouragement
that
he
could
make
no
reply
but
with
a
profound
bow
retired
hastily
from
her
presence
went
to
his
lodgings
and
sat
down
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
his
face
buried
in
his
large
hands
the
fingers
of
which
appeared
to
be
crushing
in
his
forehead
as
if
to
stifle
the
thoughts
that
burned
there
after
sitting
thus
for
half
an
hour
he
suddenly
rose
with
his
face
somewhat
paler
and
his
lips
a
little
more
firmly
compressed
than
usual
it
was
an
epoch
in
his
existence
the
man
who
had
so
often
and
so
successfully
deceived
others
had
made
the
wonderful
discovery
that
he
had
deceived
himself
he
had
imagined
that
money
was
his
sole
object
in
wishing
to
marry
rose
he
now
discovered
that
love
or
something
like
it
had
so
much
to
do
with
his
wishes
that
he
resolved
to
have
her
without
money
and
also
without
her
consent
something
within
the
man
told
him
that
rose
refusal
was
an
unalterable
one
he
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
waste
time
in
a
second
attempt
his
plans
though
hastily
formed
required
a
good
deal
of
preliminary
arrangement
so
he
commenced
to
carry
them
out
with
the
single
exclamation
i
do
it
accompanied
with
a
blow
from
his
heavy
fist
on
the
table
which
being
a
weak
one
was
split
from
end
to
end
but
the
managing
director
had
a
soul
above
furniture
at
that
moment
he
hastily
put
on
his
hat
and
strode
out
of
the
house
making
good
use
of
a
good
horse
he
paid
sundry
mysterious
visits
to
various
smuggling
characters
to
all
of
whom
he
was
particularly
agreeable
and
liberal
in
the
bestowal
of
portions
of
the
thirty
thousand
pounds
with
which
a
too
confiding
public
had
intrusted
him
among
other
places
he
went
to
a
cottage
on
a
moor
between
just
and
penzance
and
had
a
confidential
interview
with
a
man
named
hicks
who
was
noted
for
his
capacity
to
adapt
himself
to
circumstances
when
well
paid
without
being
troubled
by
conscientious
scruples
this
man
had
a
son
who
had
once
suffered
from
a
broken
and
whose
ears
were
particularly
sharp
he
chanced
to
overhear
the
conversation
at
the
interview
referred
to
and
dutifully
reported
the
same
to
his
mother
who
happened
to
be
a
great
gossip
and
knew
much
about
the
private
affairs
of
nearly
everybody
living
within
six
miles
of
her
the
good
woman
resolved
to
make
some
use
of
her
information
but
mr
clearemout
left
the
cottage
in
ignorance
of
course
of
her
resolution
having
transacted
these
little
pieces
of
business
the
managing
director
returned
home
and
on
the
day
following
sought
and
obtained
an
interview
with
rose
ellis
in
her
bower
recollecting
the
subject
of
their
last
conversation
rose
blushed
as
much
with
indignation
as
confusion
at
being
intruded
upon
but
mr
clearemout
at
once
dispersed
her
angry
feelings
by
assuring
her
in
tones
of
deferential
urbanity
that
he
would
not
have
presumed
to
intrude
upon
her
but
for
the
fact
that
he
was
about
to
quit
cornwall
without
delay
and
he
wished
to
talk
with
her
for
only
a
few
minutes
on
business
connected
with
mr
donnithorne
there
was
something
so
manly
and
straightforward
in
his
tone
and
manner
that
she
could
not
choose
but
allow
him
to
sit
down
beside
her
although
she
did
falter
out
something
about
the
propriety
of
talking
on
her
uncle
business
affairs
with
mr
donnithorne
himself
your
observation
is
most
just
said
mr
clearemout
earnestly
but
you
are
aware
that
your
uncle
nature
is
a
delicate
sensitive
one
and
i
feel
that
he
would
shrink
from
proposals
coming
from
me
that
he
might
listen
to
if
made
to
him
through
you
i
need
not
conceal
from
you
miss
ellis
that
i
am
acquainted
with
the
losses
which
your
uncle
has
recently
sustained
and
no
one
can
appreciate
more
keenly
than
i
do
the
harshness
with
which
the
world
in
its
ignorance
of
details
is
apt
to
judge
of
the
circumstances
which
brought
about
this
sad
state
of
things
i
can
not
help
feeling
deeply
the
kindness
which
has
been
shown
me
by
mr
donnithorne
during
my
residence
here
and
i
would
if
i
could
show
him
some
kindness
in
return
mr
clearemout
paused
here
a
few
moments
as
if
to
reflect
he
resolved
to
assume
that
mr
donnithorne
losses
were
ruinous
little
imagining
that
in
this
assumption
he
was
so
very
near
the
truth
rose
felt
grateful
to
him
for
the
kind
and
delicate
way
in
which
he
referred
to
her
uncle
altered
circumstances
of
course
continued
the
managing
director
i
need
not
say
to
that
his
independent
spirit
would
never
permit
him
to
accept
of
assistance
in
the
form
which
would
be
most
immediately
beneficial
to
him
indeed
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
offer
money
even
as
a
loan
but
it
happens
that
i
have
the
power
just
now
of
disposing
of
the
shares
which
he
has
taken
in
wheal
dooem
mine
at
a
very
large
profit
and
as
my
hope
of
the
success
of
that
enterprise
is
very
small
i
very
small
echoed
rose
in
surprise
you
astonish
me
mr
clearemout
did
i
not
hear
you
only
a
few
nights
ago
say
that
you
had
the
utmost
confidence
in
the
success
of
your
undertaking
most
true
replied
the
managing
director
with
a
smile
but
in
the
world
of
business
a
few
hours
work
wonderful
changes
sometimes
in
one
opinion
of
things
witness
the
vacillations
and
variations
if
i
may
venture
to
allude
before
a
lady
to
such
an
incomprehensible
subject
rose
felt
her
vigorous
little
spirit
rise
and
she
was
about
to
return
a
smart
reply
in
defence
of
woman
intelligence
even
in
business
matters
but
the
recollection
of
the
altered
relative
position
in
which
they
now
stood
restrained
her
yes
continued
mr
clearemout
with
a
sigh
the
confidence
which
i
felt
in
wheal
dooem
has
been
much
shaken
of
late
and
the
sooner
your
uncle
sells
out
the
better
but
would
it
be
right
said
rose
earnestly
to
sell
our
shares
at
a
high
profit
if
things
be
as
you
say
quite
right
replied
clearemout
with
a
bland
smile
of
honesty
believe
the
mine
to
be
a
bad
speculation
my
friend
we
shall
suppose
believes
it
to
be
a
good
one
believing
as
i
do
i
choose
to
sell
out
believing
as
he
does
he
chooses
to
buy
in
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
miss
ellis
done
every
day
with
eyes
open
i
assure
you
but
it
is
not
every
day
that
a
chance
occurs
so
opportunely
as
the
present
and
i
felt
it
to
be
a
duty
to
give
my
friend
the
benefit
of
my
knowledge
before
quitting
this
place
for
ever
there
was
something
so
kind
and
touching
in
the
tone
of
the
managing
director
that
rose
was
quite
drawn
towards
him
and
felt
as
if
she
had
actually
done
him
an
unkindness
in
refusing
him
but
continued
her
companion
i
can
do
nothing
miss
ellis
without
your
assistance
you
shall
have
it
said
rose
earnestly
for
i
would
do
anything
that
a
woman
might
venture
to
benefit
my
dear
dear
uncle
and
i
feel
assured
that
you
would
not
ask
me
to
do
anything
wrong
or
unwomanly
i
would
not
indeed
answered
clearemout
with
emotion
but
the
world
is
apt
to
misjudge
in
matters
of
delicacy
to
ask
you
to
meet
me
on
the
cliffs
near
priest
cove
close
to
cape
cornwall
would
appear
wrong
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
and
with
justice
said
rose
quickly
with
a
look
of
mingled
dignity
and
surprise
nevertheless
this
is
absolutely
needful
if
we
would
accomplish
the
object
in
view
a
friend
whom
i
know
to
be
desirous
of
purchasing
shares
in
the
mine
is
to
pass
round
the
cape
in
his
yacht
this
evening
the
idea
of
offering
these
shares
to
him
had
not
occurred
to
me
when
i
wrote
to
say
that
i
would
meet
him
there
he
can
not
come
up
here
i
know
but
the
stroke
of
a
pen
with
one
of
the
family
to
witness
it
will
be
sufficient
it
was
a
bold
stroke
of
fancy
in
the
managing
director
to
put
the
matter
in
such
a
ridiculously
unbusinesslike
light
but
he
counted
much
on
rose
ignorance
as
for
poor
rose
herself
she
knew
not
what
to
say
or
do
at
first
but
when
clearemout
heaved
a
sigh
and
with
an
expression
of
deep
sadness
on
his
countenance
rose
to
take
leave
she
allowed
a
generous
impulse
to
sway
her
your
answer
then
is
no
said
clearemout
with
deep
pathos
in
his
tone
now
it
chanced
that
at
this
critical
point
in
the
conversation
oliver
trembath
having
left
the
cottage
walked
over
the
grass
towards
a
small
gate
near
which
the
bower
stood
he
unavoidably
heard
the
question
and
also
the
quick
earnest
reply
my
answer
mr
clearemout
is
yes
i
will
meet
you
this
evening
on
the
cliff
she
frankly
gave
him
her
hand
as
she
spoke
and
he
gallantly
pressed
it
to
his
lips
an
act
which
took
rose
by
surprise
and
caused
her
to
pull
it
away
suddenly
she
then
turned
and
ran
out
at
the
side
of
the
bower
to
seek
the
solitude
of
her
own
apartment
while
clearemout
left
it
by
the
other
side
and
stood
face
to
face
with
the
spellbound
oliver
to
say
that
both
gentlemen
turned
pale
as
their
eyes
met
would
not
give
an
adequate
idea
of
their
appearance
oliver
heart
as
well
as
his
body
when
he
heard
the
question
and
reply
stood
still
as
if
he
had
been
paralysed
this
then
he
thought
was
the
end
of
all
his
hopes
hopes
hardly
admitted
to
himself
and
never
revealed
to
rose
except
in
unstudied
looks
and
tones
for
a
few
moments
his
face
grew
absolutely
livid
while
he
glared
at
his
rival
on
the
other
hand
mr
clearemout
believing
that
the
whole
of
his
conversation
had
been
overheard
supposed
that
he
had
discovered
all
his
villainy
to
one
who
was
thoroughly
able
as
well
as
willing
to
thwart
him
for
a
moment
he
felt
an
almost
irresistible
impulse
to
spring
on
and
slay
his
enemy
his
face
became
dark
with
suppressed
emotion
and
it
is
quite
possible
that
in
the
fury
of
his
disappointed
malice
he
might
have
attempted
violence
had
not
oliver
spoken
his
voice
was
husky
as
he
said
chance
sir
unfortunate
miserable
chance
led
me
to
overhear
the
last
few
words
that
passed
between
you
and
he
paused
unable
to
say
more
instantly
the
truth
flashed
across
clearemout
quick
mind
he
drew
himself
up
boldly
and
the
blood
returned
to
his
face
as
he
replied
if
so
sir
you
can
not
but
be
aware
that
the
lady
choice
is
free
and
that
your
aspect
and
attitude
towards
me
are
unworthy
of
a
gentleman
a
wonderful
influence
for
weal
or
woe
results
from
the
selection
of
a
phrase
or
a
word
had
clearemout
charged
oliver
with
insolence
or
presumption
he
would
certainly
have
struck
him
to
the
ground
but
the
words
unworthy
of
a
gentleman
created
a
revulsion
in
his
feelings
thought
is
swifter
than
light
he
saw
himself
in
the
position
of
a
disappointed
man
scowling
on
a
successful
rival
who
had
done
him
no
injury
thank
you
clearemout
your
rebuke
is
merited
he
said
bitterly
and
turning
on
his
heel
he
bounded
over
the
low
stone
wall
of
the
garden
and
hastened
away
whither
he
went
he
knew
not
a
fierce
fire
seemed
to
rage
in
his
breast
and
burn
in
his
brain
at
first
he
walked
at
full
speed
but
as
he
cleared
the
town
he
ran
ran
as
he
had
never
run
before
for
the
time
being
he
was
absolutely
mad
over
marsh
and
moor
he
sped
clearing
all
obstacles
with
a
bound
and
making
straight
for
the
land
end
with
no
definite
purpose
in
view
for
after
a
time
he
appeared
to
change
his
intention
if
he
had
any
he
turned
sharp
to
the
left
and
ran
straight
to
penzance
never
pausing
in
his
mad
career
until
he
neared
the
town
the
few
labourers
he
chanced
to
pass
on
the
way
gazed
after
him
in
surprise
but
he
heeded
not
at
the
cottage
on
the
moor
where
he
had
bandaged
the
shoulder
of
the
little
boy
a
woman
voice
called
loudly
anxiously
after
him
but
he
paid
no
attention
at
last
he
came
to
a
full
stop
and
pressing
both
hands
tightly
over
his
forehead
made
a
terrible
effort
to
collect
his
thoughts
he
was
partially
successful
and
with
somewhat
of
his
wonted
composure
walked
rapidly
into
the
town
chapter
thirty
one
describes
a
marred
plot
and
tells
of
retributive
justice
meanwhile
the
gossiping
woman
of
the
cottage
on
the
moor
whose
grateful
heart
had
never
forgotten
the
little
kindness
done
to
her
boy
by
the
young
doctor
and
who
knew
that
the
doctor
loved
rose
ellis
more
surely
perhaps
than
rose
did
herself
went
off
in
a
state
of
deep
anxiety
to
just
and
by
dint
of
diligent
inquiries
and
piecing
of
things
together
coupled
with
her
knowledge
of
clearemout
intentions
came
to
a
pretty
correct
conclusion
as
to
the
state
of
affairs
she
then
went
to
the
abode
of
young
charles
tregarthen
whom
she
knew
to
be
oliver
friend
and
unbosomed
herself
charlie
repaid
her
with
more
than
thanks
and
almost
hugged
her
in
his
gratitude
for
her
prompt
activity
and
now
mrs
hicks
said
he
you
shall
see
how
we
will
thwart
this
scoundrel
as
for
oliver
trembath
i
can
not
imagine
what
could
take
him
into
penzance
in
the
wild
state
that
you
describe
of
course
this
affair
has
to
do
with
it
and
he
evidently
has
learned
something
of
this
and
must
have
misunderstood
the
matter
else
assuredly
he
had
not
been
absent
at
such
a
time
but
why
go
to
penzance
however
he
will
clear
up
the
mystery
ere
long
no
doubt
meanwhile
we
shall
proceed
to
thwart
your
schemes
good
mr
clearemout
so
saying
charlie
tregarthen
set
about
laying
his
he
also
as
the
managing
director
had
done
visited
several
men
some
of
whom
were
miners
and
some
smugglers
and
arranged
a
meeting
that
evening
near
cape
cornwall
when
evening
drew
on
apace
four
separate
parties
converged
towards
priest
cove
first
a
boat
crept
along
shore
propelled
by
four
men
and
steered
by
jim
cuttance
secondly
six
stout
men
crept
stealthily
down
to
the
cove
led
by
charlie
tregarthen
with
maggot
as
his
second
in
command
thirdly
rose
ellis
wended
her
way
to
the
rendezvous
with
trembling
step
and
beating
heart
and
fourthly
george
augustus
clearemout
moved
in
the
same
direction
but
the
managing
director
moved
faster
than
the
others
having
a
longer
way
to
travel
for
having
had
to
pay
a
last
visit
to
wheal
dooem
he
rode
thence
to
just
on
the
way
he
was
particularly
interested
in
a
which
worked
a
pump
beside
which
a
man
in
mining
costume
was
seated
smoking
his
pipe
said
clearemout
reining
up
sur
what
does
that
pump
asked
the
managing
director
pointing
to
the
wheel
that
sur
said
the
miner
drawing
a
few
whiffs
from
his
pipe
why
that
do
pump
gold
out
o
the
londoners
that
do
the
managing
director
chuckled
very
much
and
said
indeed
iss
sur
continued
the
miner
pointing
to
wheal
dooem
an
that
wan
theere
up
over
hill
do
the
same
thing
the
managing
director
chuckled
much
more
at
this
and
displayed
his
teeth
largely
as
he
nodded
to
the
man
and
rode
on
before
his
arrival
at
the
rendezvous
the
boat
was
run
ashore
not
far
from
the
spot
where
tregarthen
and
his
men
were
concealed
as
soon
as
the
men
had
landed
charlie
walked
down
to
them
alone
and
accosted
their
leader
well
cuttance
you
a
pretty
fellow
to
put
your
finger
in
such
a
dirty
pie
as
this
cuttance
had
seen
the
approach
of
tregarthen
with
surprise
and
some
alarm
well
sur
said
he
without
any
of
the
bold
expression
that
usually
characterised
him
what
can
a
man
do
when
he
to
be
well
paid
for
the
job
i
do
confess
that
i
do
half
like
it
but
after
all
what
have
we
got
to
do
weth
the
opinions
of
owld
aunts
or
uncles
if
a
gurl
do
choose
to
go
off
wi
the
man
she
likes
that
no
matter
to
we
an
if
i
be
well
paid
for
lendin
a
hand
why
should
i
but
it
do
puzzle
me
mr
tregarthen
to
guess
how
yow
did
come
to
knaw
of
it
that
do
signify
said
tregarthen
sternly
do
you
know
who
the
girl
is
i
do
knaw
an
i
do
care
said
jim
doggedly
what
would
you
say
if
i
told
you
it
was
miss
rose
ellis
said
charlie
i
say
thee
was
a
liard
replied
cuttance
then
i
do
tell
you
so
thee
do
mean
that
exclaimed
the
smuggler
with
a
blaze
of
amazement
and
wrath
in
his
face
indeed
i
do
whew
whistled
jim
then
that
do
explain
the
reason
why
that
feller
said
he
would
car
her
to
the
boat
close
veiled
up
for
fear
the
men
should
see
her
a
rapid
consultation
was
now
held
by
the
two
as
to
the
proper
mode
of
proceeding
cuttance
counselled
an
immediate
capture
of
the
culprit
and
pitching
him
off
the
end
of
cape
cornwall
but
tregarthen
advised
that
they
should
wait
until
clearemout
seized
his
victim
otherwise
they
could
not
convict
him
because
he
would
deny
any
intention
of
evil
against
rose
and
pretend
that
some
other
girl
who
had
been
scared
away
by
their
impetuosity
was
concerned
for
they
might
depend
on
it
get
up
a
plausible
story
and
defeat
them
tregarthen
plan
was
finally
agreed
to
and
he
returned
to
his
men
and
explained
matters
soon
afterwards
the
managing
director
appeared
coming
down
the
road
is
all
right
he
inquired
of
cuttance
who
went
forward
to
meet
him
all
right
sur
go
down
to
the
boat
then
and
wait
he
said
turning
away
ere
long
he
was
joined
by
rose
with
whom
he
entered
into
conversation
leading
her
over
the
cape
so
as
to
get
out
of
sight
of
the
men
but
young
tregarthen
crept
among
the
rocks
and
never
for
a
moment
lost
sight
of
them
he
saw
clearemout
suddenly
place
a
kerchief
on
rose
mouth
and
despite
the
poor
girl
struggles
tie
it
firmly
so
as
to
prevent
her
screaming
then
he
threw
a
large
shawl
over
her
and
catching
her
in
his
arms
bore
her
swiftly
towards
the
boat
tregarthen
sprang
up
and
confronted
him
clearemout
astonished
and
maddened
by
this
unexpected
interference
shouted
stand
aside
sir
have
no
interest
in
this
matter
or
right
to
interfere
charlie
made
no
reply
but
sprang
on
him
like
a
tiger
clearemout
dropped
his
burden
and
grappled
with
the
youth
who
threw
him
in
an
instant
big
though
he
was
for
tregarthen
was
a
practised
wrestler
and
the
managing
director
was
not
his
great
strength
however
enabled
him
to
get
on
his
knees
and
there
is
no
saying
how
the
struggle
might
have
terminated
had
not
cuttance
come
forward
and
putting
his
hard
hands
round
clearemout
throat
caused
that
gentleman
face
to
grow
black
and
his
tongue
and
eyes
to
protrude
having
thus
induced
him
to
submit
he
eased
off
the
necklace
and
assisted
him
to
rise
while
the
men
of
both
parties
crowded
round
now
then
boys
cried
jim
cuttance
bear
a
hand
one
and
all
and
into
the
say
with
him
the
managing
director
was
at
once
knocked
off
his
legs
and
borne
down
to
the
beach
by
as
many
hands
as
could
lay
hold
of
him
here
they
paused
all
together
boys
one
two
ho
at
the
word
the
unfortunate
man
was
shot
by
strong
and
willing
arms
into
the
air
like
a
bombshell
and
fell
into
the
water
with
a
splash
that
was
not
unlike
an
explosion
clearemout
was
a
good
swimmer
when
he
came
to
the
surface
he
raised
himself
and
clearing
the
water
from
his
eyes
glanced
round
even
in
that
extremity
the
quickness
and
of
the
man
did
not
forsake
him
he
perceived
at
a
glance
that
the
boat
which
in
the
excitement
of
the
capture
had
been
left
by
all
the
men
had
floated
off
with
the
receding
tide
and
now
lay
a
short
distance
from
the
shore
at
once
he
struck
out
for
it
there
was
a
shout
of
consternation
and
a
rush
to
the
water
edge
maggot
shot
far
ahead
of
the
others
plunged
into
the
sea
and
swam
off
observing
this
and
knowing
well
the
courage
and
daring
of
the
man
the
rest
stopped
on
the
shore
to
witness
the
result
clearemout
reached
the
boat
first
but
owing
to
exhaustion
was
unable
to
raise
himself
into
it
maggot
soon
came
up
and
grasped
him
by
the
throat
both
men
managed
to
get
their
arms
over
the
gunwale
but
in
their
struggle
upset
the
boat
and
were
separated
clearemout
then
made
for
the
shore
with
the
intention
of
giving
himself
up
and
maggot
followed
but
he
was
not
equal
in
swimming
to
the
managing
director
whose
long
steady
strokes
easily
took
him
beyond
the
reach
of
his
pursuer
he
reached
the
shore
and
stalked
slowly
out
of
the
water
at
the
same
moment
maggot
sank
and
disappeared
the
consternation
of
his
comrades
was
so
great
that
in
the
confusion
their
prisoner
was
unheeded
some
sprang
into
the
sea
and
dived
after
maggot
others
swam
to
the
boat
intending
to
right
it
and
get
the
suddenly
those
who
had
remained
on
the
beach
observed
something
creep
out
of
the
sea
near
to
some
rocks
a
little
to
the
right
of
the
place
where
they
stood
they
ran
towards
it
hallo
is
that
you
old
maggot
they
cried
it
was
indeed
the
valiant
smith
himself
how
he
got
there
no
one
ever
knew
nor
could
himself
tell
it
was
conjectured
that
he
must
have
become
partially
exhausted
and
after
sinking
had
crept
along
the
bottom
to
the
shore
however
be
that
as
it
may
there
he
was
lying
with
his
arm
lovingly
round
a
rock
and
the
first
thing
he
said
on
looking
up
was
aw
my
dear
men
has
any
of
got
a
chaw
of
baccy
about
this
was
of
course
received
with
a
shout
of
laughter
and
unlimited
offers
of
quids
while
they
assisted
him
to
rise
meanwhile
tregarthen
was
attending
to
rose
who
had
swooned
when
clearemout
dropped
her
he
also
kept
a
watch
over
the
prisoner
who
however
showed
no
intention
of
attempting
to
escape
but
sat
on
a
stone
with
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
the
men
soon
turned
their
attention
to
him
again
and
some
of
the
more
violent
were
advancing
to
seize
him
with
many
terrible
threats
of
further
vengeance
when
rose
ran
between
them
and
entreated
them
to
spare
him
tregarthen
seconded
the
proposal
and
urged
that
as
he
had
got
pretty
severe
punishment
already
they
should
set
him
free
this
being
agreed
to
charlie
turned
to
the
managing
director
and
said
with
a
look
of
pity
you
may
go
sir
but
be
assured
it
is
not
for
your
own
sake
that
we
let
you
off
you
know
pretty
well
what
the
result
would
be
if
we
chose
to
deliver
you
up
to
justice
we
care
more
however
for
the
feelings
of
this
lady
whose
name
would
be
unavoidably
and
disagreeably
brought
before
the
public
at
the
trial
than
we
care
for
your
getting
your
merited
reward
but
mark
me
if
you
ever
open
your
lips
on
the
subject
you
shall
not
escape
us
iss
added
jim
cuttance
ann
remember
you
chucklehead
that
if
you
do
write
or
utter
wan
word
it
after
gettin
back
to
london
there
are
here
twelve
cornish
men
who
will
never
rest
till
they
have
flayed
thee
alive
you
need
have
no
fear
said
clearemout
with
a
bitter
smile
as
he
turned
and
walked
away
followed
by
a
groan
from
the
whole
party
now
lads
said
cuttance
after
he
was
gone
not
wan
word
of
this
must
ever
be
breathed
and
we
howld
responsible
david
hicks
for
wife
tongue
dost
a
hear
this
was
agreed
to
by
all
and
to
the
credit
of
these
honest
smugglers
and
of
mrs
hicks
be
it
said
that
not
a
syllable
about
the
incident
was
ever
heard
of
in
the
parish
of
just
from
that
day
to
this
chapter
thirty
two
touches
on
love
and
on
pilchard
fishing
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
fortune
favours
the
brave
and
maggot
was
one
of
those
braves
whom
about
this
time
she
took
special
delight
in
favouring
wild
and
apparently
reckless
though
he
was
maggot
had
long
cherished
an
ambitious
hope
and
had
for
some
time
past
been
laying
by
money
for
the
purpose
of
accomplishing
his
object
which
was
the
procuring
of
a
and
boats
for
the
pilchard
fishery
the
recent
successes
he
had
met
with
in
botallack
enabled
him
to
achieve
his
aim
more
rapidly
than
he
had
anticipated
and
on
the
day
following
that
in
which
clearemout
received
his
deserts
he
went
to
penberth
cove
to
see
that
all
was
in
readiness
for
pilchards
had
recently
appeared
off
the
coast
in
small
shoals
that
same
day
oliver
trembath
having
spent
a
night
of
misery
in
penzance
made
up
his
mind
to
return
to
just
and
face
his
fate
like
a
man
but
he
found
it
so
difficult
to
carry
this
resolve
into
effect
that
he
diverged
from
the
highroad
as
he
had
done
on
his
first
memorable
visit
to
that
region
and
without
knowing
very
well
why
sauntered
in
a
very
unenviable
frame
of
mind
towards
penberth
cove
old
mr
donnithorne
possessed
a
pretty
villa
near
the
cove
to
which
he
was
wont
to
migrate
when
mrs
d
felt
a
desire
for
change
of
air
and
in
which
he
frequently
entertained
large
parties
of
friends
in
the
summer
season
in
his
heart
poor
mr
donnithorne
had
condemned
this
villa
to
the
hammer
but
the
improved
appearance
of
things
in
the
mines
had
induced
him
to
suspend
the
execution
of
the
sentence
news
of
the
appearance
of
pilchards
and
a
desire
to
give
rose
a
change
after
her
late
adventure
induced
mr
donnithorne
to
hire
a
phaeton
he
had
recently
parted
with
his
own
and
drive
over
to
penberth
arrived
there
he
sauntered
down
to
the
cove
to
look
after
his
nets
for
he
dabbled
in
pilchard
fishing
as
well
as
in
other
matters
and
rose
went
off
to
have
a
quiet
solitary
walk
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
she
and
oliver
trembath
suddenly
met
in
a
lonely
part
of
the
road
between
penberth
and
penzance
ah
those
sudden
and
unexpected
meetings
how
pleasant
they
are
and
how
well
every
one
who
has
had
them
remembers
them
miss
ellis
exclaimed
oliver
in
surprise
mr
trembath
exclaimed
rose
in
amazement
you
see
reader
how
polite
they
were
but
you
can
neither
see
nor
conceive
how
great
was
the
effort
made
by
each
to
conceal
the
tumult
that
agitated
the
breast
and
flushed
the
countenance
while
the
tongue
was
thus
ably
controlled
it
did
not
last
long
however
oliver
being
thrown
off
his
guard
asked
a
number
of
confused
questions
and
rose
in
her
somewhat
irrelevant
replies
happened
to
make
some
reference
to
that
villain
clearemout
villain
echoed
oliver
in
undisguised
amazement
the
villain
repeated
rose
with
a
flushed
face
and
flashing
eye
what
why
how
really
excuse
me
miss
ellis
i
i
the
villain
clearemout
you
do
there
is
no
saying
how
many
more
ridiculous
exclamations
oliver
might
have
made
had
not
rose
suddenly
said
surely
mr
trembath
you
have
heard
of
his
villainy
no
never
not
a
word
pray
do
tell
me
miss
ellis
rose
at
once
related
the
circumstances
of
her
late
adventure
with
much
indignation
in
her
tone
and
many
a
blush
on
her
brow
before
she
had
half
done
oliver
powers
of
restraint
gave
way
then
you
never
loved
him
he
exclaimed
loved
him
sir
i
do
not
understand
forgive
me
rose
i
mean
i
did
imagine
that
is
to
say
oh
rose
can
it
be
is
it
possible
my
girl
he
seized
her
hand
at
this
point
and
but
really
reader
why
should
we
go
on
is
it
not
something
like
a
violation
of
good
taste
to
be
too
particular
here
is
it
not
sufficient
to
say
that
old
mr
donnithorne
came
suddenly
and
of
course
unexpectedly
on
them
at
that
critical
juncture
rendering
it
necessary
for
rose
to
burst
away
and
hide
her
blushing
face
on
her
uncle
shoulder
while
oliver
utterly
overwhelmed
turned
and
walked
we
wo
say
fled
at
full
speed
in
the
direction
of
the
cove
here
he
found
things
in
a
condition
that
was
admirably
suited
to
the
state
of
his
feelings
the
fishermen
of
the
cove
were
in
a
state
of
wild
excitement
for
an
enormous
shoal
of
pilchards
had
been
enclosed
in
the
and
maggot
with
his
men
as
well
as
the
people
employed
by
mr
donnithorne
were
as
much
over
head
and
ears
in
fishing
as
oliver
was
in
love
do
you
ask
why
all
this
excitement
we
will
tell
you
the
pilchard
fishing
is
to
the
cornish
fisherman
what
the
harvest
is
to
the
husbandman
but
this
harvest
of
the
sea
is
not
the
result
of
prolonged
labour
care
and
wisdom
it
comes
to
him
in
a
night
it
may
last
only
a
few
days
or
weeks
sometimes
it
fails
altogether
during
these
days
of
sunshine
he
must
toil
with
unwonted
energy
there
is
no
rest
for
him
while
the
season
lasts
if
he
would
not
miss
his
opportunity
the
pilchard
is
a
little
fish
resembling
a
small
herring
it
visits
the
southern
coasts
of
england
in
autumn
and
winter
and
the
shoals
are
so
enormous
as
to
defy
calculation
or
description
when
they
arrive
on
the
coast
huers
men
are
stationed
on
the
cliffs
to
direct
the
boatmen
when
to
go
out
and
where
to
shoot
their
when
these
are
shot
millions
of
pilchards
are
often
enclosed
in
a
single
net
to
give
an
idea
of
the
numbers
of
fish
and
the
extent
of
the
fishing
in
a
few
words
we
may
state
the
fact
that
in
one
shoal
of
great
depth
and
nearly
a
mile
broad
extended
from
hayle
river
to
ives
a
distance
of
two
and
a
half
miles
a
seine
was
shot
into
this
mass
and
hogsheads
were
carried
to
the
curing
cellars
as
there
are
pilchards
in
each
hogshead
the
catch
amounted
to
nearly
eleven
million
fish
the
value
of
these
might
be
pounds
a
hogshead
and
the
clear
profit
about
pound
a
hogshead
so
that
it
is
no
wonder
we
hear
of
fortunes
having
been
made
in
a
few
hauls
of
the
pilchard
seines
at
the
same
time
losses
are
sometimes
very
heavy
owing
to
gales
arising
and
breaking
or
carrying
away
the
nets
such
facts
combined
with
the
uncertainty
of
the
arrival
or
continuance
of
the
fish
on
any
particular
part
of
the
coast
tend
to
induce
that
spirit
of
eager
anxious
excitement
to
which
we
have
referred
as
being
so
congenial
to
oliver
trembath
state
of
mind
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
on
the
beach
the
young
doctor
found
maggot
and
his
men
launching
their
boats
and
of
course
he
lent
them

curt

jump
in
an
go
with
us
oliver
accepted
the
invitation
and
was
rowed
towards
a
part
of
the
bay
where
the
sea
appeared
to
be
boiling
the
boat
was
a
large
one
attended
by
several
others
of
smaller
dimensions
the
boiling
spot
being
reached
maggot
whose
whole
being
was
in
a
blaze
of
enthusiasm
leaped
up
and
seized
the
end
of
a
three
hundred
fathoms
long
by
fourteen
deep
which
he
began
to
throw
overboard
with
the
utmost
energy
while
the
boat
was
rowed
swiftly
round
the
mass
of
fish
david
trevarrow
assisted
him
and
in
less
than
four
minutes
the
whole
net
was
in
the
sea
one
of
the
other
boats
meanwhile
had
fastened
another
net
to
the
first
and
rowing
in
an
opposite
direction
from
it
progressed
in
a
circular
course
dropping
its
net
as
it
went
until
the
two
met
and
thus
an
immense
shoal
of
pilchards
were
enclosed
the
nets
being
floated
on
the
surface
with
corks
and
their
lower
ends
sunk
to
the
bottom
with
leads
the
fish
were
thus
securely
imprisoned
but
the
security
was
not
great
a
gale
might
arise
which
would
sweep
away
the
whole
concern
or
the
pilchards
might
take
a
fancy
to
make
a
dash
in
one
particular
direction
in
the
event
of
which
they
would
certainly
burst
the
net
and
no
human
power
could
save
a
single
fin
in
order
to
prevent
this
the
men
in
the
smaller
boats
rowed
round
the
seine
beat
the
sea
with
their
oars
hallooed
and
otherwise
exerted
themselves
to
keep
the
fish
in
the
centre
of
the
enclosure
meanwhile
a
little
boat
entered
within
the
circle
having
a
small
net
named
a
which
was
spread
round
the
seine
inside
and
gradually
drawn
together
until
the
fish
were
raised
towards
the
surface
in
a
solid
sweltering
mass
the
excitement
at
this
point
became
tremendous
thousands
of
silvery
fish
leaped
vaulted
and
fluttered
in
a
seething
mass
on
the
sea
maggot
roared
and
yelled
his
orders
like
a
stentor
even
mild
david
trevarrow
lost
and
shouted
vociferously
hand
the
basket
cried
maggot
a
large
basket
with
a
rope
attached
to
one
handle
was
produced
maggot
seized
the
other
handle
and
thrust
it
down
among
the
wriggling
pilchards
trevarrow
hauled
on
the
rope
lifted
the
basket
out
of
the
sea
and
a
cataract
of
living
silver
was
shot
into
the
boat
accompanied
by
a
mighty
cheer
basketful
after
basketful
followed
until
the
men
stood
in
fish
hold
on
a
bit
cried
maggot
as
with
sleeves
dishevelled
hair
and
glaring
eyes
he
threw
one
leg
over
the
side
of
the
boat
the
more
easily
to
continue
his
work
have
a
care
cried
oliver
at
that
moment
stretching
out
his
hand
but
he
was
too
late
the
excitable
smith
had
overbalanced
himself
and
was
already
head
and
shoulders
deep
down
among
the
pilchards
which
sprang
high
over
him
as
if
in
triumph
to
catch
him
by
the
legs
and
pull
him
back
into
the
boat
was
the
work
of
a
moment
but
the
proceedings
were
not
interrupted
by
the
mishap
a
laugh
greeted
the
smith
as
he
was
turned
head
up
and
immediately
he
braced
himself
to
his
arduous
labour
with
renewed
energy
the
boat
filled
it
was
rowed
to
the
shore
and
here
was
received
by
eager
and
noisy
men
women
and
children
by
whom
the
precious
contents
were
carried
to
the
cellars
or
where
they
were
packed

the
neatest
possible

so
was
the

worked
like

the
only
difference
between
baby

and
the
others
being
that
while
they
did
as
much
work
as
in

lay
he

as

there
too
baby
maggot
had
decreed
that
it
should
accompany
him
so
there
it
was
living
on
pilchards
and
dragging
out
its
harassed
existence
in
the
usual
way
what
between
salt
food
and
play
kicks
cuffs
capers
and
gluttony
its
aspect
at
that
time
was
more
demoniacal
perhaps
than
that
of
any
other
chet
between
john
o
groat
and
the
land
end
volumes
would
scarcely
contain
all
that
might
be
written
about
this
wonderful
scene
but
enough
has
been
said
to
indicate
the
process
whereby
maggot
secured
and
salted
some
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pilchards
the
enclosing
of
the
fish
was
the
result
of
a
few
work
but
the
salting
and
packing
were
not
ended
for
many
days
the
result
however
was
that
the
lucky
smith
sent
many
hogsheads
of
pilchards
the
way
of
most
cornish
fish
namely
to
the
mediterranean
for
consumption
by
roman
catholics
and
in
due
course
he
received
the
proceeds
to
the
extent
of
three
thousand
pounds
thus
did
maggot
auspiciously
begin
the
making
of
his
fortune
which
was
originated
and
finally
completed
by
his
successful
mining
operations
at
botallack
and
let
it
be
observed
here
that
he
was
neither
the
first
nor
the
last
poor
man
who
became
prosperous
and
wealthy
by
similar
means
there
are
men
not
a
few
now
alive
in
cornwall
who
began
with
hammer
and
pick
and
who
now
can
afford
to

that

round

millions
of
these
little

were

among
others
old
mr
donnithorne
was
so
successful
that
his
broken
fortunes
were
almost
and
a
small
sum
which
our
friend
oliver
trembath
had
ventured
to
invest
in
the
fishing
was
more
than
quadrupled
before
the
end
of
the
year
but
this
was
not
all
at
the
next
botallack
mr
cornish
gladdened
the
hearts
of
the
adventurers
by
telling
them
that
the
lodes
which
had
been
promising
for
such
a
length
of
time
had
at
last
got
the
length
of
performance
and
that
he
had
now
the
pleasure
of
announcing
a
large
dividend
which
he
paid
there
and
then
a
considerable
share
of
this
fell
to
old
mr
donnithorne
who
in
the
enthusiasm
of
the
occasion
observed
confidentially
to
captain
dan
that
he
was
convinced
honesty
was
the
best
policy
after
all
a
sentiment
which
the
captain
heartily
agreed
with
although
he
failed
to
detect
the
precise
connection
between
it
and
the
old
gentleman
sudden
influx
of
good
fortune
but
then
the
captain
did
not
drink
botallack
punch
while
old
mr
donnithorne
did
which
may
to
some
extent
account
for
the
difference
in
their
powers
of
vision
captain
dan
however
possessed
wonderful
powers
of
vision
in
reference
to
the
underground
workings
of
botallack
which
were
displayed
to
advantage
and
to
the
great
gratification
of
the
shareholders
when
at
the
request
of
mr
cornish
he
stood
up
and
gave
a
detailed
and
graphic
account
of
the
prospects
of
the
mine
telling
them
that
the
appearance
of
the
lodes
in
several
parts
of
the
mine
was
very
promising
indeed
and
that
some
ground
was
returning
a
rich
harvest
for
the
labour
that
had
been
bestowed
on
it
that
in
the
which
was
driving
north
by
six
men
they
had
taken
down
the
copper
for
fourteen
fathoms
long
nearly
the
whole
of
which
had
turned
out
to
be
worth
pounds
per
fathom
that
a
splice
had
been
formed
in
the
lode
about
two
fathoms
behind
the
present
end
which
had
disordered
it
but
he
was
glad
to
say
it
was
again
improving
and
was
at
that
time
about
fifteen
inches
wide
of
rich
copper
and
as
far
as
he
could
judge
they
were
going
through
to
the
top
part
of
the
bunch
of
copper
that
these
facts
he
thought
were
very
satisfactory
but
that
it
was
still
more
gratifying
to
know
that
the
lode
on
the
bottom
of
the
was
far
more
valuable
than
that
in
the
back
that
in
the
crowns
especially
in
the
various
levels
under
the
sea
the
lodes
were
not
only
promising
but
performing
great
things
two
men
and
a
boy
he
referred
to
maggot
trevarrow
and
zackey
here
having
broken
an
immense
quantity
of
copper
during
the
last
quarter
which
was
paying
splendidly
at
this
point
mr
grenfell
who
sat
on
mr
cornish
right
hand
exclaimed
hear
hear
and
a
little
man
with
a
red
nose
and
blue
spectacles
near
the
foot
of
the
table
echoed
hear
with
genuine
enthusiasm
for
he
had
been
bordering
on
bankruptcy
for
some
months
past
and
swigged
off
a
full
glass
of
punch
without
winking
thus
encouraged
captain
dan
went
on
to
remark
that
there
were
six
men
driving
in
wheal
hazzard
which
statement
caused
a
stranger
who
chanced
to
be
at
the
dinner
to
observe
in
an
undertone
that
he
was
not
aware
they
had
horses
or
vehicles
of
any
kind
in
the
mines
that
one
was
also
being
driven
and
three
winzes
were
sinking
and
one
rise
several
of
which
were
opening
up
tin
of
quality
while
in
the
narrow
shaft
chicornish
higher
mine
and
wheal
cock
a
great
deal
to
the
same
effect
was
being
done
all
of
which
we
leave
to
the
imagination
of
the
reader
merely
remarking
that
however
incomprehensible
these
things
may
appear
to
him
or
her
they
created
feelings
of
profound
joy
in
the
assembled
guests
especially
in
the
breast
of
the
almost
bankrupt
one
with
the
bald
red
and
blue
headpiece
mr
cornish
afterwards
congratulated
the
adventurers
on
the
success
of
the
mine
and
the
splendid
prospects
which
were
opening
up
to
them
prospects
which
he
had
no
doubt
would
be
fully
realised
ere
long
he
referred
also
to
the
condition
of
the
miners
of
the
neighbourhood
and
alluded
to
the
fact
that
the
neighbouring
mines
wheal
owles
and
levant
were
also
in
a
flourishing
condition
a
matter
he
said
for
which
they
had
reason
to
be
profoundly
thankful
for
the
distress
in
the
district
had
been
severe
and
prolonged
the
manager
voice
deepened
at
this
point
and
he
spoke
with
pathos
for
he
had
a
kindly
heart
and
his
thoughts
were
at
the
moment
with
many
a
poor
miner
in
whose
little
cottages
the
effects
of
gaunt
poverty
could
be
traced
in
scanty
furniture
meagre
fare
and
careworn
brows
he
remembered
too
that
only
the
week
before
he
had
seen
poor
blind
john
batten
carried
to
his
grave
and
had
heard
the
sobs
of
the
bereaved
widow
as
she
attempted
to
tell
him
how
the
brave
man
had
forgotten
himself
to
the
very
last
when
he
put
his
wasted
hand
on
her
head
and
said
i
goin
to
leave
thee
mary
for
a
time
but
cheer
up
dear
lass
i
be
with
jesus
soon
have
my
sight
restored
and
look
wance
more
the
faces
of
the
dear
boys
an
your
own
sweet
face
too
dear
lass
when
we
meet
again
in
heaven
there
was
one
of
the
miners
and
shareholders
of
botallack
who
did
not
die
but
who
lived
to
enjoy
the
fruit
of
his
labour
and
the
sunshine
of
prosperity
james
penrose
recovered
not
only
his
health
but
also
in
some
degree
his
sight
one
of
his
eyes
had
indeed
been
entirely
destroyed
by
the
explosion
which
had
so
nearly
killed
him
but
the
other
was
partially
restored
a
long
period
elapsed
however
ere
he
was
able
to
go
about
then
he
found
his
circumstances
so
much
improved
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
resume
work
underground
botallack
in
which
all
his
savings
had
been
invested
continued
steadily
to
improve
and
from
the
income
derived
from
this
source
alone
he
was
enabled
to
live
without
labouring
but
penrose
was
not
the
man
to
sit
down
in
idleness
wesley
never
had
a
more
earnest
follower
than
this
miner
of
just
thenceforth
he
devoted
himself
to
preaching
teaching
and
doing
good
as
his
hand
found
opportunity
and
being
an
active
man
as
well
as
conscientious
he
laboured
to
the
end
of
his
days
in
the
service
of
his
lord
more
energetically
than
he
had
ever
toiled
in
the
mines
penrose
and
david
trevarrow
had
always
been
staunch
friends
after
the
accident
to
the
former
they
became
more
closely
united
than
before
trevarrow
did
not
give
up
underground
work
he
possessed
no
shares
in
any
of
the
mines
but
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
mining
community
he
benefited
by
the
sunshine
of
prosperity
that
became
so
bright
at
that
period
and
found
leisure
when
above
ground
to
join
his
friend
in
his
labours
of
love
they
both
agreed
to
make
an
earnest
effort
to
convince
maggot
and
john
cock
of
the
error
of
their
ways
with
what
amount
of
success
it
is
not
easy
to
state
for
these
worthies
were
made
of
stubborn
metal
that
required
a
furnace
of
unusually
fierce
heat
to
melt
it
however
we
are
warranted
in
concluding
that
some
good
was
done
from
the
fact
that
both
of
them
gave
up
smuggling
and
in
various
other
ways
showed
indication
of
an
improved
state
of
mind
maggot
especially
gave
a
signal
and
unexpected
proof
of
a
softened
spirit
when
one
sunday
morning
as
he
was
getting
ready
for
chapel
he
said
to
his
wife
that
it
was
high
time
to
send
that
little
chucklehead
the
baby
to
sunday
school
for
he
was
no
better
than
a
small
heathen
the
baby
be
it
observed
was
about
six
years
old
at
the
time
when
this
speech
was
made
and
his
the
chet
was
a
with
innumerable
chets
of
her
own
it
is
right
to
add
that
in
accordance
with
this
opinion
of
his
father
the
baby
was
carried
off
to
school
that
very
morning
by
zackey
and
grace
the
first
having
grown
to
be
a
strapping
youth
and
the
other
a
lovely
girl
for
whose
sake
there
were
scores
of
young
miners
in
just
who
would
gladly
have
walked
ten
miles
on
their
bare
knees
or
dived
head
foremost

or
jumped
over
the
cliffs
into
zawn
buzzangein
or
done
any
other
insane
act
or
desperate
deed
if
by
so
doing
they
could
have
caused
one
thrill
of
pleasure
to
pass
through
her
dear
little
heart
it
is
not
necessary
we
should
think
to
say
that
in
the
midst
of
so
much
sunshine
oliver
trembath
and
rose
ellis
thought
it
advisable
to
make
hay
old
mr
donnithorne
and
his
excellent
wife
of
whose
goodness
and
wisdom
by
the
way
he
became
more
and
more
convinced
every
day
of
his
life
saw
no
objection
whatever
to
this
so
the
young
couple
were
wed
at
the
wesleyan
chapel
of
just
charlie
tregarthen
of
course
being
groomsman
and
the
only
vehicle
in
the
town
was
hired
to
drive
them
over
to
penberth
cove
and
bliss
as
to
george
augustus
clearemout
esquire
that
able
managing
director
despite
his
ducking
at
just
continued
to
fill
his
chair
and
to
fulfil
his
destiny
in
the
airy
little
street
in
london
where
for
many
years
he
represented
wheal
dooem
and
did
a
too
confiding
public
in
this
work
he
was
ably
assisted
by
secretary
jack
muddle
who
became
quite
celebrated
as
a
clear
expounder
and
explainer
of
veins
lodes
ores
shafts
levels
winzes
minerals
metals
and
mines
insomuch
that
he
was
regarded
by
many
of
the
confiding
public
who
frequented
his
office
as
a
more
thoroughly
learned
and
scientific
man
than
george
augustus
himself
it
is
interesting
how
ever
to
have
to
record
the
curious
fact
that
the
too
confiding
public
changed
their
opinion
at
last
on
this
head
and
came
to
regard
secretary
jack
as
a
humbug
and
the
managing
director
as
a
scoundrel
unfortunately
this
change
of
opinion
did
not
take
place
until
the
whole
of
the
too
confiding
public
the
as
clearemout
styled
them
had
lost
large
sums
of
money
and
a
few
of
them
become
bankrupt
when
affairs
had
reached
this
crisis
one
of
the
an
irascible
old
gentleman
whose
fiery
nature
seemed
to
have
singed
all
the
hair
off
his
head
leaving
it
completely
bald
went
down
to
cornwall
in
a
passion
to
sift
the
thing
for
himself
there
he
found
the
great
wheal
dooem
going
full
swing
day
and
night
under
the
superintendence
of
one
man
while
the
vast
works
underground
on
which
depended
the
enormous
dividends
promised
to
and
expected
by
the
were
carried
on
by
another
man
and
a
boy
on
making
this
discovery
the
fiery
old
gentleman
with
the
denuded
head
left
cornwall
still
in
a
passion
and
exploded
in
the
face
of
a
meeting
of
the
members
of
the
who
immediately
exploded
in
each
other
faces
and
appointed
an
indignation
committee
to
go
and
explode
with
unexampled
fury
in
the
faces
of
the
managing
director
and
secretary
jack
but
these
knowing
gentlemen
being
aware
that
the
explosion
was
coming
had
wisely
betaken
themselves
to
the
retirement
and
seclusion
of
the
continent
without
troubling
the
reader
with
further
particulars
we
may
say
in
conclusion
that
the
result
was
the
stoppage
of
wheal
dooem
mining
operations
and
the
summary
dismissal
of
the
two
men
and
the
boy
at
the
present
day
the
ruins
of
that
great
concern
may
be
seen
standing
on
the
wild
of
west
cornwall
solitary
gaunt
and
grey
with
the
iron
bob
of
the
motionless
and
pointing
up
obliquely
to
the
sky
as
if
the
giant
arm
of
the
mine
were
upraised
to
protest
for
ever
against
the
villainy
and
the
too
confiding
folly
that
had
left
it
standing
there
a
monument
of
wasted
and
misdirected
energy
a
caution
to
all
speculators
a
deserted
mine
in
the
language
of
miners
a
knacked
bal
there
are
many
such
knacked
bals
in
cornwall
with
their
iron
bobs
horizontal
depressed
or
raised
aloft
according
to
the
attitude
in
which
they
expired
holding
forth
similar
firm
silent
and
perpetual
protests
and
cautions
many
wheal
dooems
which
having
accomplished
their
ends
may
now
be
termed
wheal
donems
are
to
be
seen
all
over
the
country
on
hills
and
on
bold
headlands
but
alongside
of
these
may
be
seen
their
venerable
ancestors
still
alive
and
working
subject
indeed
at
times
to
fits
of
depression
when
as
their
indomitable
and
unconquerable
managers
will
tell
you
the
price
of
tin
is
low
and
subject
also
to
seasons
of
revival
when
they
are
getting
a
little
better
price
for
tin
but
still
working
on
with
untiring
persistency
whether
the
price
of
tin
be
high
or
low
chief
among
these
our
chosen
type
botallack
may
be
seen
bristling
on
the
grey
cliffs
of
the
far
west
with
the
atlantic
winds
and
spray
revelling
amongst
its
machinery
and
the
thunder
of
its
stamps
giving
constant
token
that
hundreds
of
cornishmen
are
still
hewing
out
tin
and
copper
from
its
gloomy
depths
as
they
did
in
days
gone
by
and
as
they
will
doubtless
continue
to
do
in
time
to
come
steadily
sternly
manfully
doing
their
work
of
sinking
and
extending
the
mine
deeper
down
under
the
sod
and
further
out
under
the
sea

end
