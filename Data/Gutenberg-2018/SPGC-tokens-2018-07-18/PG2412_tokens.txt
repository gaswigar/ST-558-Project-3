the

part
things
are
said
to
be
named
when
though
they
have
a
common
name
the
definition
corresponding
with
the
name
differs
for
each
thus
a
real
man
and
a
figure
in
a
picture
can
both
lay
claim
to
the
name
yet
these
are
equivocally
so
named
for
though
they
have
a
common
name
the
definition
corresponding
with
the
name
differs
for
each
for
should
any
one
define
in
what
sense
each
is
an
animal
his
definition
in
the
one
case
will
be
appropriate
to
that
case
only
on
the
other
hand
things
are
said
to
be
named
which
have
both
the
name
and
the
definition
answering
to
the
name
in
common
a
man
and
an
ox
are
both
and
these
are
univocally
so
named
inasmuch
as
not
only
the
name
but
also
the
definition
is
the
same
in
both
cases
for
if
a
man
should
state
in
what
sense
each
is
an
animal
the
statement
in
the
one
case
would
be
identical
with
that
in
the
other
things
are
said
to
be
named
which
derive
their
name
from
some
other
name
but
differ
from
it
in
termination
thus
the
grammarian
derives
his
name
from
the
word
and
the
courageous
man
from
the
word
part
forms
of
speech
are
either
simple
or
composite
examples
of
the
latter
are
such
expressions
as
man
runs
man
wins
of
the
former
of
things
themselves
some
are
predicable
of
a
subject
and
are
never
present
in
a
subject
thus
is
predicable
of
the
individual
man
and
is
never
present
in
a
subject
by
being
in
a
subject
i
do
not
mean
present
as
parts
are
present
in
a
whole
but
being
incapable
of
existence
apart
from
the
said
subject
some
things
again
are
present
in
a
subject
but
are
never
predicable
of
a
subject
for
instance
a
certain
point
of
grammatical
knowledge
is
present
in
the
mind
but
is
not
predicable
of
any
subject
or
again
a
certain
whiteness
may
be
present
in
the
body
for
colour
requires
a
material
basis
yet
it
is
never
predicable
of
anything
other
things
again
are
both
predicable
of
a
subject
and
present
in
a
subject
thus
while
knowledge
is
present
in
the
human
mind
it
is
predicable
of
grammar
there
is
lastly
a
class
of
things
which
are
neither
present
in
a
subject
nor
predicable
of
a
subject
such
as
the
individual
man
or
the
individual
horse
but
to
speak
more
generally
that
which
is
individual
and
has
the
character
of
a
unit
is
never
predicable
of
a
subject
yet
in
some
cases
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
such
being
present
in
a
subject
thus
a
certain
point
of
grammatical
knowledge
is
present
in
a
subject
part
when
one
thing
is
predicated
of
another
all
that
which
is
predicable
of
the
predicate
will
be
predicable
also
of
the
subject
thus
is
predicated
of
the
individual
man
but
is
predicated
of
it
will
therefore
be
predicable
of
the
individual
man
also
for
the
individual
man
is
both
and
if
genera
are
different
and
their
differentiae
are
themselves
different
in
kind
take
as
an
instance
the
genus
and
the
genus
feet
are
differentiae
of
the
species
of
knowledge
are
not
distinguished
by
the
same
differentiae
one
species
of
knowledge
does
not
differ
from
another
in
being
but
where
one
genus
is
subordinate
to
another
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
their
having
the
same
differentiae
for
the
greater
class
is
predicated
of
the
lesser
so
that
all
the
differentiae
of
the
predicate
will
be
differentiae
also
of
the
subject
part
expressions
which
are
in
no
way
composite
signify
substance
quantity
quality
relation
place
time
position
state
action
or
affection
to
sketch
my
meaning
roughly
examples
of
substance
are
or
horse
of
quantity
such
terms
as
cubits
long
or
cubits
long
of
quality
such
attributes
as
fall
under
the
category
of
relation
the
market
place
the
lyceum
under
that
of
place
year
under
that
of
time
are
terms
indicating
position
state
lance
cauterize
action
be
lanced
be
cauterized
affection
no
one
of
these
terms
in
and
by
itself
involves
an
affirmation
it
is
by
the
combination
of
such
terms
that
positive
or
negative
statements
arise
for
every
assertion
must
as
is
admitted
be
either
true
or
false
whereas
expressions
which
are
not
in
any
way
composite
such
as
can
not
be
either
true
or
false
part
substance
in
the
truest
and
primary
and
most
definite
sense
of
the
word
is
that
which
is
neither
predicable
of
a
subject
nor
present
in
a
subject
for
instance
the
individual
man
or
horse
but
in
a
secondary
sense
those
things
are
called
substances
within
which
as
species
the
primary
substances
are
included
also
those
which
as
genera
include
the
species
for
instance
the
individual
man
is
included
in
the
species
and
the
genus
to
which
the
species
belongs
is
these
therefore
that
is
to
say
the
species
and
the
genus
termed
secondary
substances
it
is
plain
from
what
has
been
said
that
both
the
name
and
the
definition
of
the
predicate
must
be
predicable
of
the
subject
for
instance
is
predicated
of
the
individual
man
now
in
this
case
the
name
of
the
species
is
applied
to
the
individual
for
we
use
the
term
in
describing
the
individual
and
the
definition
of
will
also
be
predicated
of
the
individual
man
for
the
individual
man
is
both
man
and
animal
thus
both
the
name
and
the
definition
of
the
species
are
predicable
of
the
individual
with
regard
on
the
other
hand
to
those
things
which
are
present
in
a
subject
it
is
generally
the
case
that
neither
their
name
nor
their
definition
is
predicable
of
that
in
which
they
are
present
though
however
the
definition
is
never
predicable
there
is
nothing
in
certain
cases
to
prevent
the
name
being
used
for
instance
being
present
in
a
body
is
predicated
of
that
in
which
it
is
present
for
a
body
is
called
white
the
definition
however
of
the
colour
is
never
predicable
of
the
body
everything
except
primary
substances
is
either
predicable
of
a
primary
substance
or
present
in
a
primary
substance
this
becomes
evident
by
reference
to
particular
instances
which
occur
is
predicated
of
the
species
therefore
of
the
individual
man
for
if
there
were
no
individual
man
of
whom
it
could
be
predicated
it
could
not
be
predicated
of
the
species
at
all
again
colour
is
present
in
body
therefore
in
individual
bodies
for
if
there
were
no
individual
body
in
which
it
was
present
it
could
not
be
present
in
body
at
all
thus
everything
except
primary
substances
is
either
predicated
of
primary
substances
or
is
present
in
them
and
if
these
last
did
not
exist
it
would
be
impossible
for
anything
else
to
exist
of
secondary
substances
the
species
is
more
truly
substance
than
the
genus
being
more
nearly
related
to
primary
substance
for
if
any
one
should
render
an
account
of
what
a
primary
substance
is
he
would
render
a
more
instructive
account
and
one
more
proper
to
the
subject
by
stating
the
species
than
by
stating
the
genus
thus
he
would
give
a
more
instructive
account
of
an
individual
man
by
stating
that
he
was
man
than
by
stating
that
he
was
animal
for
the
former
description
is
peculiar
to
the
individual
in
a
greater
degree
while
the
latter
is
too
general
again
the
man
who
gives
an
account
of
the
nature
of
an
individual
tree
will
give
a
more
instructive
account
by
mentioning
the
species
than
by
mentioning
the
genus
moreover
primary
substances
are
most
properly
called
substances
in
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
are
the
entities
which
underlie
everything
else
and
that
everything
else
is
either
predicated
of
them
or
present
in
them
now
the
same
relation
which
subsists
between
primary
substance
and
everything
else
subsists
also
between
the
species
and
the
genus
for
the
species
is
to
the
genus
as
subject
is
to
predicate
since
the
genus
is
predicated
of
the
species
whereas
the
species
can
not
be
predicated
of
the
genus
thus
we
have
a
second
ground
for
asserting
that
the
species
is
more
truly
substance
than
the
genus
of
species
themselves
except
in
the
case
of
such
as
are
genera
no
one
is
more
truly
substance
than
another
we
should
not
give
a
more
appropriate
account
of
the
individual
man
by
stating
the
species
to
which
he
belonged
than
we
should
of
an
individual
horse
by
adopting
the
same
method
of
definition
in
the
same
way
of
primary
substances
no
one
is
more
truly
substance
than
another
an
individual
man
is
not
more
truly
substance
than
an
individual
ox
it
is
then
with
good
reason
that
of
all
that
remains
when
we
exclude
primary
substances
we
concede
to
species
and
genera
alone
the
name
substance
for
these
alone
of
all
the
predicates
convey
a
knowledge
of
primary
substance
for
it
is
by
stating
the
species
or
the
genus
that
we
appropriately
define
any
individual
man
and
we
shall
make
our
definition
more
exact
by
stating
the
former
than
by
stating
the
latter
all
other
things
that
we
state
such
as
that
he
is
white
that
he
runs
and
so
on
are
irrelevant
to
the
definition
thus
it
is
just
that
these
alone
apart
from
primary
substances
should
be
called
substances
further
primary
substances
are
most
properly
so
called
because
they
underlie
and
are
the
subjects
of
everything
else
now
the
same
relation
that
subsists
between
primary
substance
and
everything
else
subsists
also
between
the
species
and
the
genus
to
which
the
primary
substance
belongs
on
the
one
hand
and
every
attribute
which
is
not
included
within
these
on
the
other
for
these
are
the
subjects
of
all
such
if
we
call
an
individual
man
in
grammar
the
predicate
is
applicable
also
to
the
species
and
to
the
genus
to
which
he
belongs
this
law
holds
good
in
all
cases
it
is
a
common
characteristic
of
all
substance
that
it
is
never
present
in
a
subject
for
primary
substance
is
neither
present
in
a
subject
nor
predicated
of
a
subject
while
with
regard
to
secondary
substances
it
is
clear
from
the
following
arguments
apart
from
others
that
they
are
not
present
in
a
subject
for
is
predicated
of
the
individual
man
but
is
not
present
in
any
subject
for
manhood
is
not
present
in
the
individual
man
in
the
same
way
is
also
predicated
of
the
individual
man
but
is
not
present
in
him
again
when
a
thing
is
present
in
a
subject
though
the
name
may
quite
well
be
applied
to
that
in
which
it
is
present
the
definition
can
not
be
applied
yet
of
secondary
substances
not
only
the
name
but
also
the
definition
applies
to
the
subject
we
should
use
both
the
definition
of
the
species
and
that
of
the
genus
with
reference
to
the
individual
man
thus
substance
can
not
be
present
in
a
subject
yet
this
is
not
peculiar
to
substance
for
it
is
also
the
case
that
differentiae
can
not
be
present
in
subjects
the
characteristics
and
are
predicated
of
the
species
but
not
present
in
it
for
they
are
not
in
man
moreover
the
definition
of
the
differentia
may
be
predicated
of
that
of
which
the
differentia
itself
is
predicated
for
instance
if
the
characteristic
is
predicated
of
the
species
the
definition
also
of
that
characteristic
may
be
used
to
form
the
predicate
of
the
species
for
is
terrestrial
the
fact
that
the
parts
of
substances
appear
to
be
present
in
the
whole
as
in
a
subject
should
not
make
us
apprehensive
lest
we
should
have
to
admit
that
such
parts
are
not
substances
for
in
explaining
the
phrase
present
in
a
subject
we
stated
that
we
meant
than
as
parts
in
a
whole
it
is
the
mark
of
substances
and
of
differentiae
that
in
all
propositions
of
which
they
form
the
predicate
they
are
predicated
univocally
for
all
such
propositions
have
for
their
subject
either
the
individual
or
the
species
it
is
true
that
inasmuch
as
primary
substance
is
not
predicable
of
anything
it
can
never
form
the
predicate
of
any
proposition
but
of
secondary
substances
the
species
is
predicated
of
the
individual
the
genus
both
of
the
species
and
of
the
individual
similarly
the
differentiae
are
predicated
of
the
species
and
of
the
individuals
moreover
the
definition
of
the
species
and
that
of
the
genus
are
applicable
to
the
primary
substance
and
that
of
the
genus
to
the
species
for
all
that
is
predicated
of
the
predicate
will
be
predicated
also
of
the
subject
similarly
the
definition
of
the
differentiae
will
be
applicable
to
the
species
and
to
the
individuals
but
it
was
stated
above
that
the
word
was
applied
to
those
things
which
had
both
name
and
definition
in
common
it
is
therefore
established
that
in
every
proposition
of
which
either
substance
or
a
differentia
forms
the
predicate
these
are
predicated
univocally
all
substance
appears
to
signify
that
which
is
individual
in
the
case
of
primary
substance
this
is
indisputably
true
for
the
thing
is
a
unit
in
the
case
of
secondary
substances
when
we
speak
for
instance
of
or
our
form
of
speech
gives
the
impression
that
we
are
here
also
indicating
that
which
is
individual
but
the
impression
is
not
strictly
true
for
a
secondary
substance
is
not
an
individual
but
a
class
with
a
certain
qualification
for
it
is
not
one
and
single
as
a
primary
substance
is
the
words
are
predicable
of
more
than
one
subject
yet
species
and
genus
do
not
merely
indicate
quality
like
the
term
indicates
quality
and
nothing
further
but
species
and
genus
determine
the
quality
with
reference
to
a
substance
they
signify
substance
qualitatively
differentiated
the
determinate
qualification
covers
a
larger
field
in
the
case
of
the
genus
that
in
that
of
the
species
he
who
uses
the
word
is
herein
using
a
word
of
wider
extension
than
he
who
uses
the
word
another
mark
of
substance
is
that
it
has
no
contrary
what
could
be
the
contrary
of
any
primary
substance
such
as
the
individual
man
or
animal
it
has
none
nor
can
the
species
or
the
genus
have
a
contrary
yet
this
characteristic
is
not
peculiar
to
substance
but
is
true
of
many
other
things
such
as
quantity
there
is
nothing
that
forms
the
contrary
of
cubits
long
or
of
cubits
long
or
of
or
of
any
such
term
a
man
may
contend
that
is
the
contrary
of
or
of
but
of
definite
quantitative
terms
no
contrary
exists
substance
again
does
not
appear
to
admit
of
variation
of
degree
i
do
not
mean
by
this
that
one
substance
can
not
be
more
or
less
truly
substance
than
another
for
it
has
already
been
stated
that
this
is
the
case
but
that
no
single
substance
admits
of
varying
degrees
within
itself
for
instance
one
particular
substance
can
not
be
more
or
less
man
either
than
himself
at
some
other
time
or
than
some
other
man
one
man
can
not
be
more
man
than
another
as
that
which
is
white
may
be
more
or
less
white
than
some
other
white
object
or
as
that
which
is
beautiful
may
be
more
or
less
beautiful
than
some
other
beautiful
object
the
same
quality
moreover
is
said
to
subsist
in
a
thing
in
varying
degrees
at
different
times
a
body
being
white
is
said
to
be
whiter
at
one
time
than
it
was
before
or
being
warm
is
said
to
be
warmer
or
less
warm
than
at
some
other
time
but
substance
is
not
said
to
be
more
or
less
that
which
it
is
a
man
is
not
more
truly
a
man
at
one
time
than
he
was
before
nor
is
anything
if
it
is
substance
more
or
less
what
it
is
substance
then
does
not
admit
of
variation
of
degree
the
most
distinctive
mark
of
substance
appears
to
be
that
while
remaining
numerically
one
and
the
same
it
is
capable
of
admitting
contrary
qualities
from
among
things
other
than
substance
we
should
find
ourselves
unable
to
bring
forward
any
which
possessed
this
mark
thus
one
and
the
same
colour
can
not
be
white
and
black
nor
can
the
same
one
action
be
good
and
bad
this
law
holds
good
with
everything
that
is
not
substance
but
one
and
the
selfsame
substance
while
retaining
its
identity
is
yet
capable
of
admitting
contrary
qualities
the
same
individual
person
is
at
one
time
white
at
another
black
at
one
time
warm
at
another
cold
at
one
time
good
at
another
bad
this
capacity
is
found
nowhere
else
though
it
might
be
maintained
that
a
statement
or
opinion
was
an
exception
to
the
rule
the
same
statement
it
is
agreed
can
be
both
true
and
false
for
if
the
statement
is
sitting
is
true
yet
when
the
person
in
question
has
risen
the
same
statement
will
be
false
the
same
applies
to
opinions
for
if
any
one
thinks
truly
that
a
person
is
sitting
yet
when
that
person
has
risen
this
same
opinion
if
still
held
will
be
false
yet
although
this
exception
may
be
allowed
there
is
nevertheless
a
difference
in
the
manner
in
which
the
thing
takes
place
it
is
by
themselves
changing
that
substances
admit
contrary
qualities
it
is
thus
that
that
which
was
hot
becomes
cold
for
it
has
entered
into
a
different
state
similarly
that
which
was
white
becomes
black
and
that
which
was
bad
good
by
a
process
of
change
and
in
the
same
way
in
all
other
cases
it
is
by
changing
that
substances
are
capable
of
admitting
contrary
qualities
but
statements
and
opinions
themselves
remain
unaltered
in
all
respects
it
is
by
the
alteration
in
the
facts
of
the
case
that
the
contrary
quality
comes
to
be
theirs
the
statement
is
remains
unaltered
but
it
is
at
one
time
true
at
another
false
according
to
circumstances
what
has
been
said
of
statements
applies
also
to
opinions
thus
in
respect
of
the
manner
in
which
the
thing
takes
place
it
is
the
peculiar
mark
of
substance
that
it
should
be
capable
of
admitting
contrary
qualities
for
it
is
by
itself
changing
that
it
does
so
if
then
a
man
should
make
this
exception
and
contend
that
statements
and
opinions
are
capable
of
admitting
contrary
qualities
his
contention
is
unsound
for
statements
and
opinions
are
said
to
have
this
capacity
not
because
they
themselves
undergo
modification
but
because
this
modification
occurs
in
the
case
of
something
else
the
truth
or
falsity
of
a
statement
depends
on
facts
and
not
on
any
power
on
the
part
of
the
statement
itself
of
admitting
contrary
qualities
in
short
there
is
nothing
which
can
alter
the
nature
of
statements
and
opinions
as
then
no
change
takes
place
in
themselves
these
can
not
be
said
to
be
capable
of
admitting
contrary
qualities
but
it
is
by
reason
of
the
modification
which
takes
place
within
the
substance
itself
that
a
substance
is
said
to
be
capable
of
admitting
contrary
qualities
for
a
substance
admits
within
itself
either
disease
or
health
whiteness
or
blackness
it
is
in
this
sense
that
it
is
said
to
be
capable
of
admitting
contrary
qualities
to
sum
up
it
is
a
distinctive
mark
of
substance
that
while
remaining
numerically
one
and
the
same
it
is
capable
of
admitting
contrary
qualities
the
modification
taking
place
through
a
change
in
the
substance
itself
let
these
remarks
suffice
on
the
subject
of
substance
part
quantity
is
either
discrete
or
continuous
moreover
some
quantities
are
such
that
each
part
of
the
whole
has
a
relative
position
to
the
other
parts
others
have
within
them
no
such
relation
of
part
to
part
instances
of
discrete
quantities
are
number
and
speech
of
continuous
lines
surfaces
solids
and
besides
these
time
and
place
in
the
case
of
the
parts
of
a
number
there
is
no
common
boundary
at
which
they
join
for
example
two
fives
make
ten
but
the
two
fives
have
no
common
boundary
but
are
separate
the
parts
three
and
seven
also
do
not
join
at
any
boundary
nor
to
generalize
would
it
ever
be
possible
in
the
case
of
number
that
there
should
be
a
common
boundary
among
the
parts
they
are
always
separate
number
therefore
is
a
discrete
quantity
the
same
is
true
of
speech
that
speech
is
a
quantity
is
evident
for
it
is
measured
in
long
and
short
syllables
i
mean
here
that
speech
which
is
vocal
moreover
it
is
a
discrete
quantity
for
its
parts
have
no
common
boundary
there
is
no
common
boundary
at
which
the
syllables
join
but
each
is
separate
and
distinct
from
the
rest
a
line
on
the
other
hand
is
a
continuous
quantity
for
it
is
possible
to
find
a
common
boundary
at
which
its
parts
join
in
the
case
of
the
line
this
common
boundary
is
the
point
in
the
case
of
the
plane
it
is
the
line
for
the
parts
of
the
plane
have
also
a
common
boundary
similarly
you
can
find
a
common
boundary
in
the
case
of
the
parts
of
a
solid
namely
either
a
line
or
a
plane
space
and
time
also
belong
to
this
class
of
quantities
time
past
present
and
future
forms
a
continuous
whole
space
likewise
is
a
continuous
quantity
for
the
parts
of
a
solid
occupy
a
certain
space
and
these
have
a
common
boundary
it
follows
that
the
parts
of
space
also
which
are
occupied
by
the
parts
of
the
solid
have
the
same
common
boundary
as
the
parts
of
the
solid
thus
not
only
time
but
space
also
is
a
continuous
quantity
for
its
parts
have
a
common
boundary
quantities
consist
either
of
parts
which
bear
a
relative
position
each
to
each
or
of
parts
which
do
not
the
parts
of
a
line
bear
a
relative
position
to
each
other
for
each
lies
somewhere
and
it
would
be
possible
to
distinguish
each
and
to
state
the
position
of
each
on
the
plane
and
to
explain
to
what
sort
of
part
among
the
rest
each
was
contiguous
similarly
the
parts
of
a
plane
have
position
for
it
could
similarly
be
stated
what
was
the
position
of
each
and
what
sort
of
parts
were
contiguous
the
same
is
true
with
regard
to
the
solid
and
to
space
but
it
would
be
impossible
to
show
that
the
parts
of
a
number
had
a
relative
position
each
to
each
or
a
particular
position
or
to
state
what
parts
were
contiguous
nor
could
this
be
done
in
the
case
of
time
for
none
of
the
parts
of
time
has
an
abiding
existence
and
that
which
does
not
abide
can
hardly
have
position
it
would
be
better
to
say
that
such
parts
had
a
relative
order
in
virtue
of
one
being
prior
to
another
similarly
with
number
in
counting
is
prior
to
and
to
and
thus
the
parts
of
number
may
be
said
to
possess
a
relative
order
though
it
would
be
impossible
to
discover
any
distinct
position
for
each
this
holds
good
also
in
the
case
of
speech
none
of
its
parts
has
an
abiding
existence
when
once
a
syllable
is
pronounced
it
is
not
possible
to
retain
it
so
that
naturally
as
the
parts
do
not
abide
they
can
not
have
position
thus
some
quantities
consist
of
parts
which
have
position
and
some
of
those
which
have
not
strictly
speaking
only
the
things
which
i
have
mentioned
belong
to
the
category
of
quantity
everything
else
that
is
called
quantitative
is
a
quantity
in
a
secondary
sense
it
is
because
we
have
in
mind
some
one
of
these
quantities
properly
so
called
that
we
apply
quantitative
terms
to
other
things
we
speak
of
what
is
white
as
large
because
the
surface
over
which
the
white
extends
is
large
we
speak
of
an
action
or
a
process
as
lengthy
because
the
time
covered
is
long
these
things
can
not
in
their
own
right
claim
the
quantitative
epithet
for
instance
should
any
one
explain
how
long
an
action
was
his
statement
would
be
made
in
terms
of
the
time
taken
to
the
effect
that
it
lasted
a
year
or
something
of
that
sort
in
the
same
way
he
would
explain
the
size
of
a
white
object
in
terms
of
surface
for
he
would
state
the
area
which
it
covered
thus
the
things
already
mentioned
and
these
alone
are
in
their
intrinsic
nature
quantities
nothing
else
can
claim
the
name
in
its
own
right
but
if
at
all
only
in
a
secondary
sense
quantities
have
no
contraries
in
the
case
of
definite
quantities
this
is
obvious
thus
there
is
nothing
that
is
the
contrary
of
cubits
long
or
of
cubits
long
or
of
a
surface
or
of
any
such
quantities
a
man
might
indeed
argue
that
was
the
contrary
of
and
of
but
these
are
not
quantitative
but
relative
things
are
not
great
or
small
absolutely
they
are
so
called
rather
as
the
result
of
an
act
of
comparison
for
instance
a
mountain
is
called
small
a
grain
large
in
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
latter
is
greater
than
others
of
its
kind
the
former
less
thus
there
is
a
reference
here
to
an
external
standard
for
if
the
terms
and
were
used
absolutely
a
mountain
would
never
be
called
small
or
a
grain
large
again
we
say
that
there
are
many
people
in
a
village
and
few
in
athens
although
those
in
the
city
are
many
times
as
numerous
as
those
in
the
village
or
we
say
that
a
house
has
many
in
it
and
a
theatre
few
though
those
in
the
theatre
far
outnumber
those
in
the
house
the
terms
cubits
long
cubits
long
and
so
on
indicate
quantity
the
terms
and
indicate
relation
for
they
have
reference
to
an
external
standard
it
is
therefore
plain
that
these
are
to
be
classed
as
relative
again
whether
we
define
them
as
quantitative
or
not
they
have
no
contraries
for
how
can
there
be
a
contrary
of
an
attribute
which
is
not
to
be
apprehended
in
or
by
itself
but
only
by
reference
to
something
external
again
if
and
are
contraries
it
will
come
about
that
the
same
subject
can
admit
contrary
qualities
at
one
and
the
same
time
and
that
things
will
themselves
be
contrary
to
themselves
for
it
happens
at
times
that
the
same
thing
is
both
small
and
great
for
the
same
thing
may
be
small
in
comparison
with
one
thing
and
great
in
comparison
with
another
so
that
the
same
thing
comes
to
be
both
small
and
great
at
one
and
the
same
time
and
is
of
such
a
nature
as
to
admit
contrary
qualities
at
one
and
the
same
moment
yet
it
was
agreed
when
substance
was
being
discussed
that
nothing
admits
contrary
qualities
at
one
and
the
same
moment
for
though
substance
is
capable
of
admitting
contrary
qualities
yet
no
one
is
at
the
same
time
both
sick
and
healthy
nothing
is
at
the
same
time
both
white
and
black
nor
is
there
anything
which
is
qualified
in
contrary
ways
at
one
and
the
same
time
moreover
if
these
were
contraries
they
would
themselves
be
contrary
to
themselves
for
if
is
the
contrary
of
and
the
same
thing
is
both
great
and
small
at
the
same
time
then
or
is
the
contrary
of
itself
but
this
is
impossible
the
term
therefore
is
not
the
contrary
of
the
term
nor
of
and
even
though
a
man
should
call
these
terms
not
relative
but
quantitative
they
would
not
have
contraries
it
is
in
the
case
of
space
that
quantity
most
plausibly
appears
to
admit
of
a
contrary
for
men
define
the
term
as
the
contrary
of
when
it
is
the
region
at
the
centre
they
mean
by
and
this
is
so
because
nothing
is
farther
from
the
extremities
of
the
universe
than
the
region
at
the
centre
indeed
it
seems
that
in
defining
contraries
of
every
kind
men
have
recourse
to
a
spatial
metaphor
for
they
say
that
those
things
are
contraries
which
within
the
same
class
are
separated
by
the
greatest
possible
distance
quantity
does
not
it
appears
admit
of
variation
of
degree
one
thing
can
not
be
two
cubits
long
in
a
greater
degree
than
another
similarly
with
regard
to
number
what
is
is
not
more
truly
three
than
what
is
is
five
nor
is
one
set
of
three
more
truly
three
than
another
set
again
one
period
of
time
is
not
said
to
be
more
truly
time
than
another
nor
is
there
any
other
kind
of
quantity
of
all
that
have
been
mentioned
with
regard
to
which
variation
of
degree
can
be
predicated
the
category
of
quantity
therefore
does
not
admit
of
variation
of
degree
the
most
distinctive
mark
of
quantity
is
that
equality
and
inequality
are
predicated
of
it
each
of
the
aforesaid
quantities
is
said
to
be
equal
or
unequal
for
instance
one
solid
is
said
to
be
equal
or
unequal
to
another
number
too
and
time
can
have
these
terms
applied
to
them
indeed
can
all
those
kinds
of
quantity
that
have
been
mentioned
that
which
is
not
a
quantity
can
by
no
means
it
would
seem
be
termed
equal
or
unequal
to
anything
else
one
particular
disposition
or
one
particular
quality
such
as
whiteness
is
by
no
means
compared
with
another
in
terms
of
equality
and
inequality
but
rather
in
terms
of
similarity
thus
it
is
the
distinctive
mark
of
quantity
that
it
can
be
called
equal
and
unequal
section
part
those
things
are
called
relative
which
being
either
said
to
be
of
something
else
or
related
to
something
else
are
explained
by
reference
to
that
other
thing
for
instance
the
word
is
explained
by
reference
to
something
else
for
it
is
superiority
over
something
else
that
is
meant
similarly
the
expression
has
this
external
reference
for
it
is
the
double
of
something
else
that
is
meant
so
it
is
with
everything
else
of
this
kind
there
are
moreover
other
relatives
habit
disposition
perception
knowledge
and
attitude
the
significance
of
all
these
is
explained
by
a
reference
to
something
else
and
in
no
other
way
thus
a
habit
is
a
habit
of
something
knowledge
is
knowledge
of
something
attitude
is
the
attitude
of
something
so
it
is
with
all
other
relatives
that
have
been
mentioned
those
terms
then
are
called
relative
the
nature
of
which
is
explained
by
reference
to
something
else
the
preposition
or
some
other
preposition
being
used
to
indicate
the
relation
thus
one
mountain
is
called
great
in
comparison
with
another
for
the
mountain
claims
this
attribute
by
comparison
with
something
again
that
which
is
called
similar
must
be
similar
to
something
else
and
all
other
such
attributes
have
this
external
reference
it
is
to
be
noted
that
lying
and
standing
and
sitting
are
particular
attitudes
but
attitude
is
itself
a
relative
term
to
lie
to
stand
to
be
seated
are
not
themselves
attitudes
but
take
their
name
from
the
aforesaid
attitudes
it
is
possible
for
relatives
to
have
contraries
thus
virtue
has
a
contrary
vice
these
both
being
relatives
knowledge
too
has
a
contrary
ignorance
but
this
is
not
the
mark
of
all
relatives
and
have
no
contrary
nor
indeed
has
any
such
term
it
also
appears
that
relatives
can
admit
of
variation
of
degree
for
and
and
have
the
modifications
and
applied
to
them
and
each
of
these
is
relative
in
character
for
the
terms
and
bear
a
reference
to
something
external
yet
again
it
is
not
every
relative
term
that
admits
of
variation
of
degree
no
term
such
as
admits
of
this
modification
all
relatives
have
correlatives
by
the
term
we
mean
the
slave
of
a
master
by
the
term
the
master
of
a
slave
by
the
double
of
its
half
by
the
half
of
its
double
by
greater
than
that
which
is
less
by
less
than
that
which
is
greater
so
it
is
with
every
other
relative
term
but
the
case
we
use
to
express
the
correlation
differs
in
some
instances
thus
by
knowledge
we
mean
knowledge
of
the
knowable
by
the
knowable
that
which
is
to
be
apprehended
by
knowledge
by
perception
perception
of
the
perceptible
by
the
perceptible
that
which
is
apprehended
by
perception
sometimes
however
reciprocity
of
correlation
does
not
appear
to
exist
this
comes
about
when
a
blunder
is
made
and
that
to
which
the
relative
is
related
is
not
accurately
stated
if
a
man
states
that
a
wing
is
necessarily
relative
to
a
bird
the
connexion
between
these
two
will
not
be
reciprocal
for
it
will
not
be
possible
to
say
that
a
bird
is
a
bird
by
reason
of
its
wings
the
reason
is
that
the
original
statement
was
inaccurate
for
the
wing
is
not
said
to
be
relative
to
the
bird
qua
bird
since
many
creatures
besides
birds
have
wings
but
qua
winged
creature
if
then
the
statement
is
made
accurate
the
connexion
will
be
reciprocal
for
we
can
speak
of
a
wing
having
reference
necessarily
to
a
winged
creature
and
of
a
winged
creature
as
being
such
because
of
its
wings
occasionally
perhaps
it
is
necessary
to
coin
words
if
no
word
exists
by
which
a
correlation
can
adequately
be
explained
if
we
define
a
rudder
as
necessarily
having
reference
to
a
boat
our
definition
will
not
be
appropriate
for
the
rudder
does
not
have
this
reference
to
a
boat
qua
boat
as
there
are
boats
which
have
no
rudders
thus
we
can
not
use
the
terms
reciprocally
for
the
word
can
not
be
said
to
find
its
explanation
in
the
word
as
there
is
no
existing
word
our
definition
would
perhaps
be
more
accurate
if
we
coined
some
word
like
as
the
correlative
of
if
we
express
ourselves
thus
accurately
at
any
rate
the
terms
are
reciprocally
connected
for
the
thing
is
in
virtue
of
its
rudder
so
it
is
in
all
other
cases
a
head
will
be
more
accurately
defined
as
the
correlative
of
that
which
is
than
as
that
of
an
animal
for
the
animal
does
not
have
a
head
qua
animal
since
many
animals
have
no
head
thus
we
may
perhaps
most
easily
comprehend
that
to
which
a
thing
is
related
when
a
name
does
not
exist
if
from
that
which
has
a
name
we
derive
a
new
name
and
apply
it
to
that
with
which
the
first
is
reciprocally
connected
as
in
the
aforesaid
instances
when
we
derived
the
word
from
and
from
all
relatives
then
if
properly
defined
have
a
correlative
i
add
this
condition
because
if
that
to
which
they
are
related
is
stated
as
haphazard
and
not
accurately
the
two
are
not
found
to
be
interdependent
let
me
state
what
i
mean
more
clearly
even
in
the
case
of
acknowledged
correlatives
and
where
names
exist
for
each
there
will
be
no
interdependence
if
one
of
the
two
is
denoted
not
by
that
name
which
expresses
the
correlative
notion
but
by
one
of
irrelevant
significance
the
term
if
defined
as
related
not
to
a
master
but
to
a
man
or
a
biped
or
anything
of
that
sort
is
not
reciprocally
connected
with
that
in
relation
to
which
it
is
defined
for
the
statement
is
not
exact
further
if
one
thing
is
said
to
be
correlative
with
another
and
the
terminology
used
is
correct
then
though
all
irrelevant
attributes
should
be
removed
and
only
that
one
attribute
left
in
virtue
of
which
it
was
correctly
stated
to
be
correlative
with
that
other
the
stated
correlation
will
still
exist
if
the
correlative
of
slave
is
said
to
be
master
then
though
all
irrelevant
attributes
of
the
said
such
as
of
knowledge
should
be
removed
and
the
attribute
alone
left
the
stated
correlation
existing
between
him
and
the
slave
will
remain
the
same
for
it
is
of
a
master
that
a
slave
is
said
to
be
the
slave
on
the
other
hand
if
of
two
correlatives
one
is
not
correctly
termed
then
when
all
other
attributes
are
removed
and
that
alone
is
left
in
virtue
of
which
it
was
stated
to
be
correlative
the
stated
correlation
will
be
found
to
have
disappeared
for
suppose
the
correlative
of
slave
should
be
said
to
be
man
or
the
correlative
of
wing
is
bird
if
the
attribute
be
withdrawn
from
man
the
correlation
between
and
slave
will
cease
to
exist
for
if
the
man
is
not
a
master
the
slave
is
not
a
slave
similarly
if
the
attribute
be
withdrawn
from
bird
wing
will
no
longer
be
relative
for
if
the
correlative
is
not
winged
it
follows
that
has
no
correlative
thus
it
is
essential
that
the
correlated
terms
should
be
exactly
designated
if
there
is
a
name
existing
the
statement
will
be
easy
if
not
it
is
doubtless
our
duty
to
construct
names
when
the
terminology
is
thus
correct
it
is
evident
that
all
correlatives
are
interdependent
correlatives
are
thought
to
come
into
existence
simultaneously
this
is
for
the
most
part
true
as
in
the
case
of
the
double
and
the
half
the
existence
of
the
half
necessitates
the
existence
of
that
of
which
it
is
a
half
similarly
the
existence
of
a
master
necessitates
the
existence
of
a
slave
and
that
of
a
slave
implies
that
of
a
master
these
are
merely
instances
of
a
general
rule
moreover
they
cancel
one
another
for
if
there
is
no
double
it
follows
that
there
is
no
half
and
vice
versa
this
rule
also
applies
to
all
such
correlatives
yet
it
does
not
appear
to
be
true
in
all
cases
that
correlatives
come
into
existence
simultaneously
the
object
of
knowledge
would
appear
to
exist
before
knowledge
itself
for
it
is
usually
the
case
that
we
acquire
knowledge
of
objects
already
existing
it
would
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
find
a
branch
of
knowledge
the
beginning
of
the
existence
of
which
was
contemporaneous
with
that
of
its
object
again
while
the
object
of
knowledge
if
it
ceases
to
exist
cancels
at
the
same
time
the
knowledge
which
was
its
correlative
the
converse
of
this
is
not
true
it
is
true
that
if
the
object
of
knowledge
does
not
exist
there
can
be
no
knowledge
for
there
will
no
longer
be
anything
to
know
yet
it
is
equally
true
that
if
knowledge
of
a
certain
object
does
not
exist
the
object
may
nevertheless
quite
well
exist
thus
in
the
case
of
the
squaring
of
the
circle
if
indeed
that
process
is
an
object
of
knowledge
though
it
itself
exists
as
an
object
of
knowledge
yet
the
knowledge
of
it
has
not
yet
come
into
existence
again
if
all
animals
ceased
to
exist
there
would
be
no
knowledge
but
there
might
yet
be
many
objects
of
knowledge
this
is
likewise
the
case
with
regard
to
perception
for
the
object
of
perception
is
it
appears
prior
to
the
act
of
perception
if
the
perceptible
is
annihilated
perception
also
will
cease
to
exist
but
the
annihilation
of
perception
does
not
cancel
the
existence
of
the
perceptible
for
perception
implies
a
body
perceived
and
a
body
in
which
perception
takes
place
now
if
that
which
is
perceptible
is
annihilated
it
follows
that
the
body
is
annihilated
for
the
body
is
a
perceptible
thing
and
if
the
body
does
not
exist
it
follows
that
perception
also
ceases
to
exist
thus
the
annihilation
of
the
perceptible
involves
that
of
perception
but
the
annihilation
of
perception
does
not
involve
that
of
the
perceptible
for
if
the
animal
is
annihilated
it
follows
that
perception
also
is
annihilated
but
perceptibles
such
as
body
heat
sweetness
bitterness
and
so
on
will
remain
again
perception
is
generated
at
the
same
time
as
the
perceiving
subject
for
it
comes
into
existence
at
the
same
time
as
the
animal
but
the
perceptible
surely
exists
before
perception
for
fire
and
water
and
such
elements
out
of
which
the
animal
is
itself
composed
exist
before
the
animal
is
an
animal
at
all
and
before
perception
thus
it
would
seem
that
the
perceptible
exists
before
perception
it
may
be
questioned
whether
it
is
true
that
no
substance
is
relative
as
seems
to
be
the
case
or
whether
exception
is
to
be
made
in
the
case
of
certain
secondary
substances
with
regard
to
primary
substances
it
is
quite
true
that
there
is
no
such
possibility
for
neither
wholes
nor
parts
of
primary
substances
are
relative
the
individual
man
or
ox
is
not
defined
with
reference
to
something
external
similarly
with
the
parts
a
particular
hand
or
head
is
not
defined
as
a
particular
hand
or
head
of
a
particular
person
but
as
the
hand
or
head
of
a
particular
person
it
is
true
also
for
the
most
part
at
least
in
the
case
of
secondary
substances
the
species
and
the
species
are
not
defined
with
reference
to
anything
outside
themselves
wood
again
is
only
relative
in
so
far
as
it
is
some
one
property
not
in
so
far
as
it
is
wood
it
is
plain
then
that
in
the
cases
mentioned
substance
is
not
relative
but
with
regard
to
some
secondary
substances
there
is
a
difference
of
opinion
thus
such
terms
as
and
are
defined
with
reference
to
that
of
which
the
things
indicated
are
a
part
and
so
it
comes
about
that
these
appear
to
have
a
relative
character
indeed
if
our
definition
of
that
which
is
relative
was
complete
it
is
very
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
prove
that
no
substance
is
relative
if
however
our
definition
was
not
complete
if
those
things
only
are
properly
called
relative
in
the
case
of
which
relation
to
an
external
object
is
a
necessary
condition
of
existence
perhaps
some
explanation
of
the
dilemma
may
be
found
the
former
definition
does
indeed
apply
to
all
relatives
but
the
fact
that
a
thing
is
explained
with
reference
to
something
else
does
not
make
it
essentially
relative
from
this
it
is
plain
that
if
a
man
definitely
apprehends
a
relative
thing
he
will
also
definitely
apprehend
that
to
which
it
is
relative
indeed
this
is
for
if
a
man
knows
that
some
particular
thing
is
relative
assuming
that
we
call
that
a
relative
in
the
case
of
which
relation
to
something
is
a
necessary
condition
of
existence
he
knows
that
also
to
which
it
is
related
for
if
he
does
not
know
at
all
that
to
which
it
is
related
he
will
not
know
whether
or
not
it
is
relative
this
is
clear
moreover
in
particular
instances
if
a
man
knows
definitely
that
such
and
such
a
thing
is
he
will
also
forthwith
know
definitely
that
of
which
it
is
the
double
for
if
there
is
nothing
definite
of
which
he
knows
it
to
be
the
double
he
does
not
know
at
all
that
it
is
double
again
if
he
knows
that
a
thing
is
more
beautiful
it
follows
necessarily
that
he
will
forthwith
definitely
know
that
also
than
which
it
is
more
beautiful
he
will
not
merely
know
indefinitely
that
it
is
more
beautiful
than
something
which
is
less
beautiful
for
this
would
be
supposition
not
knowledge
for
if
he
does
not
know
definitely
that
than
which
it
is
more
beautiful
he
can
no
longer
claim
to
know
definitely
that
it
is
more
beautiful
than
something
else
which
is
less
beautiful
for
it
might
be
that
nothing
was
less
beautiful
it
is
therefore
evident
that
if
a
man
apprehends
some
relative
thing
definitely
he
necessarily
knows
that
also
definitely
to
which
it
is
related
now
the
head
the
hand
and
such
things
are
substances
and
it
is
possible
to
know
their
essential
character
definitely
but
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
we
should
know
that
to
which
they
are
related
it
is
not
possible
to
know
forthwith
whose
head
or
hand
is
meant
thus
these
are
not
relatives
and
this
being
the
case
it
would
be
true
to
say
that
no
substance
is
relative
in
character
it
is
perhaps
a
difficult
matter
in
such
cases
to
make
a
positive
statement
without
more
exhaustive
examination
but
to
have
raised
questions
with
regard
to
details
is
not
without
advantage
part
by
i
mean
that
in
virtue
of
which
people
are
said
to
be
such
and
such
quality
is
a
term
that
is
used
in
many
senses
one
sort
of
quality
let
us
call
or
habit
differs
from
disposition
in
being
more
lasting
and
more
firmly
established
the
various
kinds
of
knowledge
and
of
virtue
are
habits
for
knowledge
even
when
acquired
only
in
a
moderate
degree
is
it
is
agreed
abiding
in
its
character
and
difficult
to
displace
unless
some
great
mental
upheaval
takes
place
through
disease
or
any
such
cause
the
virtues
also
such
as
justice
and
so
on
are
not
easily
dislodged
or
dismissed
so
as
to
give
place
to
vice
by
a
disposition
on
the
other
hand
we
mean
a
condition
that
is
easily
changed
and
quickly
gives
place
to
its
opposite
thus
heat
cold
disease
health
and
so
on
are
dispositions
for
a
man
is
disposed
in
one
way
or
another
with
reference
to
these
but
quickly
changes
becoming
cold
instead
of
warm
ill
instead
of
well
so
it
is
with
all
other
dispositions
also
unless
through
lapse
of
time
a
disposition
has
itself
become
inveterate
and
almost
impossible
to
dislodge
in
which
case
we
should
perhaps
go
so
far
as
to
call
it
a
habit
it
is
evident
that
men
incline
to
call
those
conditions
habits
which
are
of
a
more
or
less
permanent
type
and
difficult
to
displace
for
those
who
are
not
retentive
of
knowledge
but
volatile
are
not
said
to
have
such
and
such
a
as
regards
knowledge
yet
they
are
disposed
we
may
say
either
better
or
worse
towards
knowledge
thus
habit
differs
from
disposition
in
this
that
while
the
latter
in
ephemeral
the
former
is
permanent
and
difficult
to
alter
habits
are
at
the
same
time
dispositions
but
dispositions
are
not
necessarily
habits
for
those
who
have
some
specific
habit
may
be
said
also
in
virtue
of
that
habit
to
be
thus
or
thus
disposed
but
those
who
are
disposed
in
some
specific
way
have
not
in
all
cases
the
corresponding
habit
another
sort
of
quality
is
that
in
virtue
of
which
for
example
we
call
men
good
boxers
or
runners
or
healthy
or
sickly
in
fact
it
includes
all
those
terms
which
refer
to
inborn
capacity
or
incapacity
such
things
are
not
predicated
of
a
person
in
virtue
of
his
disposition
but
in
virtue
of
his
inborn
capacity
or
incapacity
to
do
something
with
ease
or
to
avoid
defeat
of
any
kind
persons
are
called
good
boxers
or
good
runners
not
in
virtue
of
such
and
such
a
disposition
but
in
virtue
of
an
inborn
capacity
to
accomplish
something
with
ease
men
are
called
healthy
in
virtue
of
the
inborn
capacity
of
easy
resistance
to
those
unhealthy
influences
that
may
ordinarily
arise
unhealthy
in
virtue
of
the
lack
of
this
capacity
similarly
with
regard
to
softness
and
hardness
hardness
is
predicated
of
a
thing
because
it
has
that
capacity
of
resistance
which
enables
it
to
withstand
disintegration
softness
again
is
predicated
of
a
thing
by
reason
of
the
lack
of
that
capacity
a
third
class
within
this
category
is
that
of
affective
qualities
and
affections
sweetness
bitterness
sourness
are
examples
of
this
sort
of
quality
together
with
all
that
is
akin
to
these
heat
moreover
and
cold
whiteness
and
blackness
are
affective
qualities
it
is
evident
that
these
are
qualities
for
those
things
that
possess
them
are
themselves
said
to
be
such
and
such
by
reason
of
their
presence
honey
is
called
sweet
because
it
contains
sweetness
the
body
is
called
white
because
it
contains
whiteness
and
so
in
all
other
cases
the
term
quality
is
not
used
as
indicating
that
those
things
which
admit
these
qualities
are
affected
in
any
way
honey
is
not
called
sweet
because
it
is
affected
in
a
specific
way
nor
is
this
what
is
meant
in
any
other
instance
similarly
heat
and
cold
are
called
affective
qualities
not
because
those
things
which
admit
them
are
affected
what
is
meant
is
that
these
said
qualities
are
capable
of
producing
an
in
the
way
of
perception
for
sweetness
has
the
power
of
affecting
the
sense
of
taste
heat
that
of
touch
and
so
it
is
with
the
rest
of
these
qualities
whiteness
and
blackness
however
and
the
other
colours
are
not
said
to
be
affective
qualities
in
this
sense
but
because
they
themselves
are
the
results
of
an
affection
it
is
plain
that
many
changes
of
colour
take
place
because
of
affections
when
a
man
is
ashamed
he
blushes
when
he
is
afraid
he
becomes
pale
and
so
on
so
true
is
this
that
when
a
man
is
by
nature
liable
to
such
affections
arising
from
some
concomitance
of
elements
in
his
constitution
it
is
a
probable
inference
that
he
has
the
corresponding
complexion
of
skin
for
the
same
disposition
of
bodily
elements
which
in
the
former
instance
was
momentarily
present
in
the
case
of
an
access
of
shame
might
be
a
result
of
a
man
natural
temperament
so
as
to
produce
the
corresponding
colouring
also
as
a
natural
characteristic
all
conditions
therefore
of
this
kind
if
caused
by
certain
permanent
and
lasting
affections
are
called
affective
qualities
for
pallor
and
duskiness
of
complexion
are
called
qualities
inasmuch
as
we
are
said
to
be
such
and
such
in
virtue
of
them
not
only
if
they
originate
in
natural
constitution
but
also
if
they
come
about
through
long
disease
or
sunburn
and
are
difficult
to
remove
or
indeed
remain
throughout
life
for
in
the
same
way
we
are
said
to
be
such
and
such
because
of
these
those
conditions
however
which
arise
from
causes
which
may
easily
be
rendered
ineffective
or
speedily
removed
are
called
not
qualities
but
affections
for
we
are
not
said
to
be
such
in
virtue
of
them
the
man
who
blushes
through
shame
is
not
said
to
be
a
constitutional
blusher
nor
is
the
man
who
becomes
pale
through
fear
said
to
be
constitutionally
pale
he
is
said
rather
to
have
been
affected
thus
such
conditions
are
called
affections
not
qualities
in
like
manner
there
are
affective
qualities
and
affections
of
the
soul
that
temper
with
which
a
man
is
born
and
which
has
its
origin
in
certain
affections
is
called
a
quality
i
mean
such
conditions
as
insanity
irascibility
and
so
on
for
people
are
said
to
be
mad
or
irascible
in
virtue
of
these
similarly
those
abnormal
psychic
states
which
are
not
inborn
but
arise
from
the
concomitance
of
certain
other
elements
and
are
difficult
to
remove
or
altogether
permanent
are
called
qualities
for
in
virtue
of
them
men
are
said
to
be
such
and
such
those
however
which
arise
from
causes
easily
rendered
ineffective
are
called
affections
not
qualities
suppose
that
a
man
is
irritable
when
vexed
he
is
not
even
spoken
of
as
a
man
when
in
such
circumstances
he
loses
his
temper
somewhat
but
rather
is
said
to
be
affected
such
conditions
are
therefore
termed
not
qualities
but
affections
the
fourth
sort
of
quality
is
figure
and
the
shape
that
belongs
to
a
thing
and
besides
this
straightness
and
curvedness
and
any
other
qualities
of
this
type
each
of
these
defines
a
thing
as
being
such
and
such
because
it
is
triangular
or
quadrangular
a
thing
is
said
to
have
a
specific
character
or
again
because
it
is
straight
or
curved
in
fact
a
thing
shape
in
every
case
gives
rise
to
a
qualification
of
it
rarity
and
density
roughness
and
smoothness
seem
to
be
terms
indicating
quality
yet
these
it
would
appear
really
belong
to
a
class
different
from
that
of
quality
for
it
is
rather
a
certain
relative
position
of
the
parts
composing
the
thing
thus
qualified
which
it
appears
is
indicated
by
each
of
these
terms
a
thing
is
dense
owing
to
the
fact
that
its
parts
are
closely
combined
with
one
another
rare
because
there
are
interstices
between
the
parts
smooth
because
its
parts
lie
so
to
speak
evenly
rough
because
some
parts
project
beyond
others
there
may
be
other
sorts
of
quality
but
those
that
are
most
properly
so
called
have
we
may
safely
say
been
enumerated
these
then
are
qualities
and
the
things
that
take
their
name
from
them
as
derivatives
or
are
in
some
other
way
dependent
on
them
are
said
to
be
qualified
in
some
specific
way
in
most
indeed
in
almost
all
cases
the
name
of
that
which
is
qualified
is
derived
from
that
of
the
quality
thus
the
terms
give
us
the
adjectives
and
so
on
there
are
some
cases
however
in
which
as
the
quality
under
consideration
has
no
name
it
is
impossible
that
those
possessed
of
it
should
have
a
name
that
is
derivative
for
instance
the
name
given
to
the
runner
or
boxer
who
is
so
called
in
virtue
of
an
inborn
capacity
is
not
derived
from
that
of
any
quality
for
both
those
capacities
have
no
name
assigned
to
them
in
this
the
inborn
capacity
is
distinct
from
the
science
with
reference
to
which
men
are
called
boxers
or
wrestlers
such
a
science
is
classed
as
a
disposition
it
has
a
name
and
is
called
or
as
the
case
may
be
and
the
name
given
to
those
disposed
in
this
way
is
derived
from
that
of
the
science
sometimes
even
though
a
name
exists
for
the
quality
that
which
takes
its
character
from
the
quality
has
a
name
that
is
not
a
derivative
for
instance
the
upright
man
takes
his
character
from
the
possession
of
the
quality
of
integrity
but
the
name
given
him
is
not
derived
from
the
word
yet
this
does
not
occur
often
we
may
therefore
state
that
those
things
are
said
to
be
possessed
of
some
specific
quality
which
have
a
name
derived
from
that
of
the
aforesaid
quality
or
which
are
in
some
other
way
dependent
on
it
one
quality
may
be
the
contrary
of
another
thus
justice
is
the
contrary
of
injustice
whiteness
of
blackness
and
so
on
the
things
also
which
are
said
to
be
such
and
such
in
virtue
of
these
qualities
may
be
contrary
the
one
to
the
other
for
that
which
is
unjust
is
contrary
to
that
which
is
just
that
which
is
white
to
that
which
is
black
this
however
is
not
always
the
case
red
yellow
and
such
colours
though
qualities
have
no
contraries
if
one
of
two
contraries
is
a
quality
the
other
will
also
be
a
quality
this
will
be
evident
from
particular
instances
if
we
apply
the
names
used
to
denote
the
other
categories
for
instance
granted
that
justice
is
the
contrary
of
injustice
and
justice
is
a
quality
injustice
will
also
be
a
quality
neither
quantity
nor
relation
nor
place
nor
indeed
any
other
category
but
that
of
quality
will
be
applicable
properly
to
injustice
so
it
is
with
all
other
contraries
falling
under
the
category
of
quality
qualities
admit
of
variation
of
degree
whiteness
is
predicated
of
one
thing
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
than
of
another
this
is
also
the
case
with
reference
to
justice
moreover
one
and
the
same
thing
may
exhibit
a
quality
in
a
greater
degree
than
it
did
before
if
a
thing
is
white
it
may
become
whiter
though
this
is
generally
the
case
there
are
exceptions
for
if
we
should
say
that
justice
admitted
of
variation
of
degree
difficulties
might
ensue
and
this
is
true
with
regard
to
all
those
qualities
which
are
dispositions
there
are
some
indeed
who
dispute
the
possibility
of
variation
here
they
maintain
that
justice
and
health
can
not
very
well
admit
of
variation
of
degree
themselves
but
that
people
vary
in
the
degree
in
which
they
possess
these
qualities
and
that
this
is
the
case
with
grammatical
learning
and
all
those
qualities
which
are
classed
as
dispositions
however
that
may
be
it
is
an
incontrovertible
fact
that
the
things
which
in
virtue
of
these
qualities
are
said
to
be
what
they
are
vary
in
the
degree
in
which
they
possess
them
for
one
man
is
said
to
be
better
versed
in
grammar
or
more
healthy
or
just
than
another
and
so
on
the
qualities
expressed
by
the
terms
and
do
not
appear
to
admit
of
variation
of
degree
nor
indeed
do
any
that
have
to
do
with
figure
for
those
things
to
which
the
definition
of
the
triangle
or
circle
is
applicable
are
all
equally
triangular
or
circular
those
on
the
other
hand
to
which
the
same
definition
is
not
applicable
can
not
be
said
to
differ
from
one
another
in
degree
the
square
is
no
more
a
circle
than
the
rectangle
for
to
neither
is
the
definition
of
the
circle
appropriate
in
short
if
the
definition
of
the
term
proposed
is
not
applicable
to
both
objects
they
can
not
be
compared
thus
it
is
not
all
qualities
which
admit
of
variation
of
degree
whereas
none
of
the
characteristics
i
have
mentioned
are
peculiar
to
quality
the
fact
that
likeness
and
unlikeness
can
be
predicated
with
reference
to
quality
only
gives
to
that
category
its
distinctive
feature
one
thing
is
like
another
only
with
reference
to
that
in
virtue
of
which
it
is
such
and
such
thus
this
forms
the
peculiar
mark
of
quality
we
must
not
be
disturbed
because
it
may
be
argued
that
though
proposing
to
discuss
the
category
of
quality
we
have
included
in
it
many
relative
terms
we
did
say
that
habits
and
dispositions
were
relative
in
practically
all
such
cases
the
genus
is
relative
the
individual
not
thus
knowledge
as
a
genus
is
explained
by
reference
to
something
else
for
we
mean
a
knowledge
of
something
but
particular
branches
of
knowledge
are
not
thus
explained
the
knowledge
of
grammar
is
not
relative
to
anything
external
nor
is
the
knowledge
of
music
but
these
if
relative
at
all
are
relative
only
in
virtue
of
their
genera
thus
grammar
is
said
be
the
knowledge
of
something
not
the
grammar
of
something
similarly
music
is
the
knowledge
of
something
not
the
music
of
something
thus
individual
branches
of
knowledge
are
not
relative
and
it
is
because
we
possess
these
individual
branches
of
knowledge
that
we
are
said
to
be
such
and
such
it
is
these
that
we
actually
possess
we
are
called
experts
because
we
possess
knowledge
in
some
particular
branch
those
particular
branches
therefore
of
knowledge
in
virtue
of
which
we
are
sometimes
said
to
be
such
and
such
are
themselves
qualities
and
are
not
relative
further
if
anything
should
happen
to
fall
within
both
the
category
of
quality
and
that
of
relation
there
would
be
nothing
extraordinary
in
classing
it
under
both
these
heads
section
part
action
and
affection
both
admit
of
contraries
and
also
of
variation
of
degree
heating
is
the
contrary
of
cooling
being
heated
of
being
cooled
being
glad
of
being
vexed
thus
they
admit
of
contraries
they
also
admit
of
variation
of
degree
for
it
is
possible
to
heat
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
also
to
be
heated
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
thus
action
and
affection
also
admit
of
variation
of
degree
so
much
then
is
stated
with
regard
to
these
categories
we
spoke
moreover
of
the
category
of
position
when
we
were
dealing
with
that
of
relation
and
stated
that
such
terms
derived
their
names
from
those
of
the
corresponding
attitudes
as
for
the
rest
time
place
state
since
they
are
easily
intelligible
i
say
no
more
about
them
than
was
said
at
the
beginning
that
in
the
category
of
state
are
included
such
states
as
in
that
of
place
the
lyceum
and
so
on
as
was
explained
before
part
the
proposed
categories
have
then
been
adequately
dealt
with
we
must
next
explain
the
various
senses
in
which
the
term
is
used
things
are
said
to
be
opposed
in
four
senses
i
as
correlatives
to
one
another
ii
as
contraries
to
one
another
iii
as
privatives
to
positives
iv
as
affirmatives
to
negatives
let
me
sketch
my
meaning
in
outline
an
instance
of
the
use
of
the
word
with
reference
to
correlatives
is
afforded
by
the
expressions
and
with
reference
to
contraries
by
and
opposites
in
the
sense
of
and
are
and
in
the
sense
of
affirmatives
and
negatives
the
propositions
sits
does
not
sit
i
pairs
of
opposites
which
fall
under
the
category
of
relation
are
explained
by
a
reference
of
the
one
to
the
other
the
reference
being
indicated
by
the
preposition
or
by
some
other
preposition
thus
double
is
a
relative
term
for
that
which
is
double
is
explained
as
the
double
of
something
knowledge
again
is
the
opposite
of
the
thing
known
in
the
same
sense
and
the
thing
known
also
is
explained
by
its
relation
to
its
opposite
knowledge
for
the
thing
known
is
explained
as
that
which
is
known
by
something
that
is
by
knowledge
such
things
then
as
are
opposite
the
one
to
the
other
in
the
sense
of
being
correlatives
are
explained
by
a
reference
of
the
one
to
the
other
ii
pairs
of
opposites
which
are
contraries
are
not
in
any
way
interdependent
but
are
contrary
the
one
to
the
other
the
good
is
not
spoken
of
as
the
good
of
the
bad
but
as
the
contrary
of
the
bad
nor
is
white
spoken
of
as
the
white
of
the
black
but
as
the
contrary
of
the
black
these
two
types
of
opposition
are
therefore
distinct
those
contraries
which
are
such
that
the
subjects
in
which
they
are
naturally
present
or
of
which
they
are
predicated
must
necessarily
contain
either
the
one
or
the
other
of
them
have
no
intermediate
but
those
in
the
case
of
which
no
such
necessity
obtains
always
have
an
intermediate
thus
disease
and
health
are
naturally
present
in
the
body
of
an
animal
and
it
is
necessary
that
either
the
one
or
the
other
should
be
present
in
the
body
of
an
animal
odd
and
even
again
are
predicated
of
number
and
it
is
necessary
that
the
one
or
the
other
should
be
present
in
numbers
now
there
is
no
intermediate
between
the
terms
of
either
of
these
two
pairs
on
the
other
hand
in
those
contraries
with
regard
to
which
no
such
necessity
obtains
we
find
an
intermediate
blackness
and
whiteness
are
naturally
present
in
the
body
but
it
is
not
necessary
that
either
the
one
or
the
other
should
be
present
in
the
body
inasmuch
as
it
is
not
true
to
say
that
everybody
must
be
white
or
black
badness
and
goodness
again
are
predicated
of
man
and
of
many
other
things
but
it
is
not
necessary
that
either
the
one
quality
or
the
other
should
be
present
in
that
of
which
they
are
predicated
it
is
not
true
to
say
that
everything
that
may
be
good
or
bad
must
be
either
good
or
bad
these
pairs
of
contraries
have
intermediates
the
intermediates
between
white
and
black
are
grey
sallow
and
all
the
other
colours
that
come
between
the
intermediate
between
good
and
bad
is
that
which
is
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
some
intermediate
qualities
have
names
such
as
grey
and
sallow
and
all
the
other
colours
that
come
between
white
and
black
in
other
cases
however
it
is
not
easy
to
name
the
intermediate
but
we
must
define
it
as
that
which
is
not
either
extreme
as
in
the
case
of
that
which
is
neither
good
nor
bad
neither
just
nor
unjust
iii
and
have
reference
to
the
same
subject
thus
sight
and
blindness
have
reference
to
the
eye
it
is
a
universal
rule
that
each
of
a
pair
of
opposites
of
this
type
has
reference
to
that
to
which
the
particular
is
natural
we
say
that
that
is
capable
of
some
particular
faculty
or
possession
has
suffered
privation
when
the
faculty
or
possession
in
question
is
in
no
way
present
in
that
in
which
and
at
the
time
at
which
it
should
naturally
be
present
we
do
not
call
that
toothless
which
has
not
teeth
or
that
blind
which
has
not
sight
but
rather
that
which
has
not
teeth
or
sight
at
the
time
when
by
nature
it
should
for
there
are
some
creatures
which
from
birth
are
without
sight
or
without
teeth
but
these
are
not
called
toothless
or
blind
to
be
without
some
faculty
or
to
possess
it
is
not
the
same
as
the
corresponding
or
is
a
a
but
possess
sight
is
not
equivalent
to
be
blind
is
not
equivalent
to
blindness
is
a
to
be
blind
is
to
be
in
a
state
of
privation
but
is
not
a
moreover
if
were
equivalent
to
blind
both
would
be
predicated
of
the
same
subject
but
though
a
man
is
said
to
be
blind
he
is
by
no
means
said
to
be
blindness
to
be
in
a
state
of
is
it
appears
the
opposite
of
being
in
a
state
of
just
as
and
themselves
are
opposite
there
is
the
same
type
of
antithesis
in
both
cases
for
just
as
blindness
is
opposed
to
sight
so
is
being
blind
opposed
to
having
sight
that
which
is
affirmed
or
denied
is
not
itself
affirmation
or
denial
by
we
mean
an
affirmative
proposition
by
a
negative
now
those
facts
which
form
the
matter
of
the
affirmation
or
denial
are
not
propositions
yet
these
two
are
said
to
be
opposed
in
the
same
sense
as
the
affirmation
and
denial
for
in
this
case
also
the
type
of
antithesis
is
the
same
for
as
the
affirmation
is
opposed
to
the
denial
as
in
the
two
propositions
sits
does
not
sit
so
also
the
fact
which
constitutes
the
matter
of
the
proposition
in
one
case
is
opposed
to
that
in
the
other
his
sitting
that
is
to
say
to
his
not
sitting
it
is
evident
that
and
are
not
opposed
each
to
each
in
the
same
sense
as
relatives
the
one
is
not
explained
by
reference
to
the
other
sight
is
not
sight
of
blindness
nor
is
any
other
preposition
used
to
indicate
the
relation
similarly
blindness
is
not
said
to
be
blindness
of
sight
but
rather
privation
of
sight
relatives
moreover
reciprocate
if
blindness
therefore
were
a
relative
there
would
be
a
reciprocity
of
relation
between
it
and
that
with
which
it
was
correlative
but
this
is
not
the
case
sight
is
not
called
the
sight
of
blindness
that
those
terms
which
fall
under
the
heads
of
and
are
not
opposed
each
to
each
as
contraries
either
is
plain
from
the
following
facts
of
a
pair
of
contraries
such
that
they
have
no
intermediate
one
or
the
other
must
needs
be
present
in
the
subject
in
which
they
naturally
subsist
or
of
which
they
are
predicated
for
it
is
those
as
we
proved
in
the
case
of
which
this
necessity
obtains
that
have
no
intermediate
moreover
we
cited
health
and
disease
odd
and
even
as
instances
but
those
contraries
which
have
an
intermediate
are
not
subject
to
any
such
necessity
it
is
not
necessary
that
every
substance
receptive
of
such
qualities
should
be
either
black
or
white
cold
or
hot
for
something
intermediate
between
these
contraries
may
very
well
be
present
in
the
subject
we
proved
moreover
that
those
contraries
have
an
intermediate
in
the
case
of
which
the
said
necessity
does
not
obtain
yet
when
one
of
the
two
contraries
is
a
constitutive
property
of
the
subject
as
it
is
a
constitutive
property
of
fire
to
be
hot
of
snow
to
be
white
it
is
necessary
determinately
that
one
of
the
two
contraries
not
one
or
the
other
should
be
present
in
the
subject
for
fire
can
not
be
cold
or
snow
black
thus
it
is
not
the
case
here
that
one
of
the
two
must
needs
be
present
in
every
subject
receptive
of
these
qualities
but
only
in
that
subject
of
which
the
one
forms
a
constitutive
property
moreover
in
such
cases
it
is
one
member
of
the
pair
determinately
and
not
either
the
one
or
the
other
which
must
be
present
in
the
case
of
and
on
the
other
hand
neither
of
the
aforesaid
statements
holds
good
for
it
is
not
necessary
that
a
subject
receptive
of
the
qualities
should
always
have
either
the
one
or
the
other
that
which
has
not
yet
advanced
to
the
state
when
sight
is
natural
is
not
said
either
to
be
blind
or
to
see
thus
and
do
not
belong
to
that
class
of
contraries
which
consists
of
those
which
have
no
intermediate
on
the
other
hand
they
do
not
belong
either
to
that
class
which
consists
of
contraries
which
have
an
intermediate
for
under
certain
conditions
it
is
necessary
that
either
the
one
or
the
other
should
form
part
of
the
constitution
of
every
appropriate
subject
for
when
a
thing
has
reached
the
stage
when
it
is
by
nature
capable
of
sight
it
will
be
said
either
to
see
or
to
be
blind
and
that
in
an
indeterminate
sense
signifying
that
the
capacity
may
be
either
present
or
absent
for
it
is
not
necessary
either
that
it
should
see
or
that
it
should
be
blind
but
that
it
should
be
either
in
the
one
state
or
in
the
other
yet
in
the
case
of
those
contraries
which
have
an
intermediate
we
found
that
it
was
never
necessary
that
either
the
one
or
the
other
should
be
present
in
every
appropriate
subject
but
only
that
in
certain
subjects
one
of
the
pair
should
be
present
and
that
in
a
determinate
sense
it
is
therefore
plain
that
and
are
not
opposed
each
to
each
in
either
of
the
senses
in
which
contraries
are
opposed
again
in
the
case
of
contraries
it
is
possible
that
there
should
be
changes
from
either
into
the
other
while
the
subject
retains
its
identity
unless
indeed
one
of
the
contraries
is
a
constitutive
property
of
that
subject
as
heat
is
of
fire
for
it
is
possible
that
that
that
which
is
healthy
should
become
diseased
that
which
is
white
black
that
which
is
cold
hot
that
which
is
good
bad
that
which
is
bad
good
the
bad
man
if
he
is
being
brought
into
a
better
way
of
life
and
thought
may
make
some
advance
however
slight
and
if
he
should
once
improve
even
ever
so
little
it
is
plain
that
he
might
change
completely
or
at
any
rate
make
very
great
progress
for
a
man
becomes
more
and
more
easily
moved
to
virtue
however
small
the
improvement
was
at
first
it
is
therefore
natural
to
suppose
that
he
will
make
yet
greater
progress
than
he
has
made
in
the
past
and
as
this
process
goes
on
it
will
change
him
completely
and
establish
him
in
the
contrary
state
provided
he
is
not
hindered
by
lack
of
time
in
the
case
of
and
however
change
in
both
directions
is
impossible
there
may
be
a
change
from
possession
to
privation
but
not
from
privation
to
possession
the
man
who
has
become
blind
does
not
regain
his
sight
the
man
who
has
become
bald
does
not
regain
his
hair
the
man
who
has
lost
his
teeth
does
not
grow
a
new
set
iv
statements
opposed
as
affirmation
and
negation
belong
manifestly
to
a
class
which
is
distinct
for
in
this
case
and
in
this
case
only
it
is
necessary
for
the
one
opposite
to
be
true
and
the
other
false
neither
in
the
case
of
contraries
nor
in
the
case
of
correlatives
nor
in
the
case
of
and
is
it
necessary
for
one
to
be
true
and
the
other
false
health
and
disease
are
contraries
neither
of
them
is
true
or
false
and
are
opposed
to
each
other
as
correlatives
neither
of
them
is
true
or
false
the
case
is
the
same
of
course
with
regard
to
and
such
as
and
in
short
where
there
is
no
sort
of
combination
of
words
truth
and
falsity
have
no
place
and
all
the
opposites
we
have
mentioned
so
far
consist
of
simple
words
at
the
same
time
when
the
words
which
enter
into
opposed
statements
are
contraries
these
more
than
any
other
set
of
opposites
would
seem
to
claim
this
characteristic
is
ill
is
the
contrary
of
is
well
but
not
even
of
such
composite
expressions
is
it
true
to
say
that
one
of
the
pair
must
always
be
true
and
the
other
false
for
if
socrates
exists
one
will
be
true
and
the
other
false
but
if
he
does
not
exist
both
will
be
false
for
neither
is
ill
nor
is
well
is
true
if
socrates
does
not
exist
at
all
in
the
case
of
and
if
the
subject
does
not
exist
at
all
neither
proposition
is
true
but
even
if
the
subject
exists
it
is
not
always
the
fact
that
one
is
true
and
the
other
false
for
has
sight
is
the
opposite
of
is
blind
in
the
sense
of
the
word
which
applies
to
possession
and
privation
now
if
socrates
exists
it
is
not
necessary
that
one
should
be
true
and
the
other
false
for
when
he
is
not
yet
able
to
acquire
the
power
of
vision
both
are
false
as
also
if
socrates
is
altogether
but
in
the
case
of
affirmation
and
negation
whether
the
subject
exists
or
not
one
is
always
false
and
the
other
true
for
manifestly
if
socrates
exists
one
of
the
two
propositions
is
ill
is
not
ill
is
true
and
the
other
false
this
is
likewise
the
case
if
he
does
not
exist
for
if
he
does
not
exist
to
say
that
he
is
ill
is
false
to
say
that
he
is
not
ill
is
true
thus
it
is
in
the
case
of
those
opposites
only
which
are
opposite
in
the
sense
in
which
the
term
is
used
with
reference
to
affirmation
and
negation
that
the
rule
holds
good
that
one
of
the
pair
must
be
true
and
the
other
false
part
that
the
contrary
of
a
good
is
an
evil
is
shown
by
induction
the
contrary
of
health
is
disease
of
courage
cowardice
and
so
on
but
the
contrary
of
an
evil
is
sometimes
a
good
sometimes
an
evil
for
defect
which
is
an
evil
has
excess
for
its
contrary
this
also
being
an
evil
and
the
mean
which
is
a
good
is
equally
the
contrary
of
the
one
and
of
the
other
it
is
only
in
a
few
cases
however
that
we
see
instances
of
this
in
most
the
contrary
of
an
evil
is
a
good
in
the
case
of
contraries
it
is
not
always
necessary
that
if
one
exists
the
other
should
also
exist
for
if
all
become
healthy
there
will
be
health
and
no
disease
and
again
if
everything
turns
white
there
will
be
white
but
no
black
again
since
the
fact
that
socrates
is
ill
is
the
contrary
of
the
fact
that
socrates
is
well
and
two
contrary
conditions
can
not
both
obtain
in
one
and
the
same
individual
at
the
same
time
both
these
contraries
could
not
exist
at
once
for
if
that
socrates
was
well
was
a
fact
then
that
socrates
was
ill
could
not
possibly
be
one
it
is
plain
that
contrary
attributes
must
needs
be
present
in
subjects
which
belong
to
the
same
species
or
genus
disease
and
health
require
as
their
subject
the
body
of
an
animal
white
and
black
require
a
body
without
further
qualification
justice
and
injustice
require
as
their
subject
the
human
soul
moreover
it
is
necessary
that
pairs
of
contraries
should
in
all
cases
either
belong
to
the
same
genus
or
belong
to
contrary
genera
or
be
themselves
genera
white
and
black
belong
to
the
same
genus
colour
justice
and
injustice
to
contrary
genera
virtue
and
vice
while
good
and
evil
do
not
belong
to
genera
but
are
themselves
actual
genera
with
terms
under
them
part
there
are
four
senses
in
which
one
thing
can
be
said
to
be
to
another
primarily
and
most
properly
the
term
has
reference
to
time
in
this
sense
the
word
is
used
to
indicate
that
one
thing
is
older
or
more
ancient
than
another
for
the
expressions
and
imply
greater
length
of
time
secondly
one
thing
is
said
to
be
to
another
when
the
sequence
of
their
being
can
not
be
reversed
in
this
sense
is
to
for
if
exists
it
follows
directly
that
must
exist
but
if
exists
it
does
not
follow
necessarily
that
exists
thus
the
sequence
subsisting
can
not
be
reversed
it
is
agreed
then
that
when
the
sequence
of
two
things
can
not
be
reversed
then
that
one
on
which
the
other
depends
is
called
to
that
other
in
the
third
place
the
term
is
used
with
reference
to
any
order
as
in
the
case
of
science
and
of
oratory
for
in
sciences
which
use
demonstration
there
is
that
which
is
prior
and
that
which
is
posterior
in
order
in
geometry
the
elements
are
prior
to
the
propositions
in
reading
and
writing
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
are
prior
to
the
syllables
similarly
in
the
case
of
speeches
the
exordium
is
prior
in
order
to
the
narrative
besides
these
senses
of
the
word
there
is
a
fourth
that
which
is
better
and
more
honourable
is
said
to
have
a
natural
priority
in
common
parlance
men
speak
of
those
whom
they
honour
and
love
as
first
with
them
this
sense
of
the
word
is
perhaps
the
most
such
then
are
the
different
senses
in
which
the
term
is
used
yet
it
would
seem
that
besides
those
mentioned
there
is
yet
another
for
in
those
things
the
being
of
each
of
which
implies
that
of
the
other
that
which
is
in
any
way
the
cause
may
reasonably
be
said
to
be
by
nature
to
the
effect
it
is
plain
that
there
are
instances
of
this
the
fact
of
the
being
of
a
man
carries
with
it
the
truth
of
the
proposition
that
he
is
and
the
implication
is
reciprocal
for
if
a
man
is
the
proposition
wherein
we
allege
that
he
is
true
and
conversely
if
the
proposition
wherein
we
allege
that
he
is
true
then
he
is
the
true
proposition
however
is
in
no
way
the
cause
of
the
being
of
the
man
but
the
fact
of
the
man
being
does
seem
somehow
to
be
the
cause
of
the
truth
of
the
proposition
for
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
proposition
depends
on
the
fact
of
the
man
being
or
not
being
thus
the
word
may
be
used
in
five
senses
part
the
term
is
primarily
and
most
appropriately
applied
to
those
things
the
genesis
of
the
one
of
which
is
simultaneous
with
that
of
the
other
for
in
such
cases
neither
is
prior
or
posterior
to
the
other
such
things
are
said
to
be
simultaneous
in
point
of
time
those
things
again
are
in
point
of
nature
the
being
of
each
of
which
involves
that
of
the
other
while
at
the
same
time
neither
is
the
cause
of
the
other
being
this
is
the
case
with
regard
to
the
double
and
the
half
for
these
are
reciprocally
dependent
since
if
there
is
a
double
there
is
also
a
half
and
if
there
is
a
half
there
is
also
a
double
while
at
the
same
time
neither
is
the
cause
of
the
being
of
the
other
again
those
species
which
are
distinguished
one
from
another
and
opposed
one
to
another
within
the
same
genus
are
said
to
be
in
nature
i
mean
those
species
which
are
distinguished
each
from
each
by
one
and
the
same
method
of
division
thus
the
species
is
simultaneous
with
the
and
the
species
these
are
distinguished
within
the
same
genus
and
are
opposed
each
to
each
for
the
genus
has
the
the
and
the
species
and
no
one
of
these
is
prior
or
posterior
to
another
on
the
contrary
all
such
things
appear
to
be
in
nature
each
of
these
also
the
terrestrial
the
winged
and
the
water
species
can
be
divided
again
into
subspecies
those
species
then
also
will
be
in
point
of
nature
which
belonging
to
the
same
genus
are
distinguished
each
from
each
by
one
and
the
same
method
of
differentiation
but
genera
are
prior
to
species
for
the
sequence
of
their
being
can
not
be
reversed
if
there
is
the
species
there
will
be
the
genus
but
granted
the
being
of
the
genus
it
does
not
follow
necessarily
that
there
will
be
the
species
those
things
therefore
are
said
to
be
in
nature
the
being
of
each
of
which
involves
that
of
the
other
while
at
the
same
time
neither
is
in
any
way
the
cause
of
the
other
being
those
species
also
which
are
distinguished
each
from
each
and
opposed
within
the
same
genus
those
things
moreover
are
in
the
unqualified
sense
of
the
word
which
come
into
being
at
the
same
time
part
there
are
six
sorts
of
movement
generation
destruction
increase
diminution
alteration
and
change
of
place
it
is
evident
in
all
but
one
case
that
all
these
sorts
of
movement
are
distinct
each
from
each
generation
is
distinct
from
destruction
increase
and
change
of
place
from
diminution
and
so
on
but
in
the
case
of
alteration
it
may
be
argued
that
the
process
necessarily
implies
one
or
other
of
the
other
five
sorts
of
motion
this
is
not
true
for
we
may
say
that
all
affections
or
nearly
all
produce
in
us
an
alteration
which
is
distinct
from
all
other
sorts
of
motion
for
that
which
is
affected
need
not
suffer
either
increase
or
diminution
or
any
of
the
other
sorts
of
motion
thus
alteration
is
a
distinct
sort
of
motion
for
if
it
were
not
the
thing
altered
would
not
only
be
altered
but
would
forthwith
necessarily
suffer
increase
or
diminution
or
some
one
of
the
other
sorts
of
motion
in
addition
which
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
not
the
case
similarly
that
which
was
undergoing
the
process
of
increase
or
was
subject
to
some
other
sort
of
motion
would
if
alteration
were
not
a
distinct
form
of
motion
necessarily
be
subject
to
alteration
also
but
there
are
some
things
which
undergo
increase
but
yet
not
alteration
the
square
for
instance
if
a
gnomon
is
applied
to
it
undergoes
increase
but
not
alteration
and
so
it
is
with
all
other
figures
of
this
sort
alteration
and
increase
therefore
are
distinct
speaking
generally
rest
is
the
contrary
of
motion
but
the
different
forms
of
motion
have
their
own
contraries
in
other
forms
thus
destruction
is
the
contrary
of
generation
diminution
of
increase
rest
in
a
place
of
change
of
place
as
for
this
last
change
in
the
reverse
direction
would
seem
to
be
most
truly
its
contrary
thus
motion
upwards
is
the
contrary
of
motion
downwards
and
vice
versa
in
the
case
of
that
sort
of
motion
which
yet
remains
of
those
that
have
been
enumerated
it
is
not
easy
to
state
what
is
its
contrary
it
appears
to
have
no
contrary
unless
one
should
define
the
contrary
here
also
either
as
in
its
quality
or
as
in
the
direction
of
the
contrary
quality
just
as
we
defined
the
contrary
of
change
of
place
either
as
rest
in
a
place
or
as
change
in
the
reverse
direction
for
a
thing
is
altered
when
change
of
quality
takes
place
therefore
either
rest
in
its
quality
or
change
in
the
direction
of
the
contrary
may
be
called
the
contrary
of
this
qualitative
form
of
motion
in
this
way
becoming
white
is
the
contrary
of
becoming
black
there
is
alteration
in
the
contrary
direction
since
a
change
of
a
qualitative
nature
takes
place
part
the
term
have
is
used
in
various
senses
in
the
first
place
it
is
used
with
reference
to
habit
or
disposition
or
any
other
quality
for
we
are
said
to
a
piece
of
knowledge
or
a
virtue
then
again
it
has
reference
to
quantity
as
for
instance
in
the
case
of
a
height
for
he
is
said
to
a
height
of
three
or
four
cubits
it
is
used
moreover
with
regard
to
apparel
a
man
being
said
to
a
coat
or
tunic
or
in
respect
of
something
which
we
have
on
a
part
of
ourselves
as
a
ring
on
the
hand
or
in
respect
of
something
which
is
a
part
of
us
as
hand
or
foot
the
term
refers
also
to
content
as
in
the
case
of
a
vessel
and
wheat
or
of
a
jar
and
wine
a
jar
is
said
to
wine
and
a
wheat
the
expression
in
such
cases
has
reference
to
content
or
it
refers
to
that
which
has
been
acquired
we
are
said
to
a
house
or
a
field
a
man
is
also
said
to
a
wife
and
a
wife
a
husband
and
this
appears
to
be
the
most
remote
meaning
of
the
term
for
by
the
use
of
it
we
mean
simply
that
the
husband
lives
with
the
wife
other
senses
of
the
word
might
perhaps
be
found
but
the
most
ordinary
ones
have
all
been
enumerated
