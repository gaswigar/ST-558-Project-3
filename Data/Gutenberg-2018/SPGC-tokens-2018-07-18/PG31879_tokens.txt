preface
when
i
quitted
home
on
a
little
excursion
in
the
spring
of
this
present
year
a
thought
struck
me
which
i
began
to
put
into
immediate
execution
i
determined
to
commit
to
paper
any
little
circumstances
that
might
arise
and
any
conversations
in
which
i
might
be
engaged
when
the
subject
was
at
all
important
though
there
might
be
nothing
particularly
new
or
interesting
in
the
discussion
itself
i
fulfilled
my
intention
as
occasions
arose
to
furnish
me
with
materials
and
on
my
return
to
the
north
in
the
autumn
of
this
same
year
it
was
my
amusement
on
my
journey
to
look
over
and
arrange
these
papers
as
soon
as
i
arrived
at
my
native
place
i
lent
my
manuscript
to
a
confidential
friend
as
the
shortest
way
of
imparting
to
him
whatever
had
occurred
to
me
during
our
separation
together
with
my
reflections
on
those
occurrences
i
took
care
to
keep
his
expectations
low
by
apprizing
him
that
in
a
tour
from
my
house
in
westmoreland
to
the
house
of
a
friend
in
hampshire
he
must
not
look
for
adventures
but
content
himself
with
the
details
of
common
life
diversified
only
by
the
different
habits
and
tempers
of
the
persons
with
whom
i
had
conversed
he
brought
back
my
manuscript
in
a
few
days
with
an
earnest
wish
that
i
would
consent
to
its
publication
assuring
me
that
he
was
of
opinion
that
it
might
not
be
altogether
useless
not
only
to
young
men
engaged
in
the
same
pursuit
with
myself
but
to
the
general
reader
he
obviated
all
my
objections
arising
from
my
want
of
leisure
during
my
present
interesting
engagements
by
offering
to
undertake
the
whole
business
himself
and
to
release
me
from
any
further
trouble
as
he
was
just
setting
out
for
london
where
he
proposed
passing
more
time
than
the
printing
would
require
thus
i
am
driven
to
the
stale
apology
for
publishing
what
perhaps
it
would
have
been
more
prudent
to
have
withheld
importunity
of
an
apology
so
commonly
unfounded
and
so
repeatedly
alleged
from
the
days
of
john
faustus
to
the
publication
of
c
oe
lebs
but
whether
my
friend
or
my
vanity
had
the
largest
share
of
influence
i
am
willing
to
indulge
the
hope
that
a
better
motive
than
either
friendship
or
vanity
was
an
operating
ingredient
in
my
consent
be
that
as
it
may
i
sent
him
my
copy
all
its
imperfections
on
its
it
was
accompanied
by
a
letter
of
which
the
following
extract
shall
conclude
these
short
prefatory
remarks
i
here
send
you
my
manuscript
with
permission
to
make
what
use
of
it
you
please
by
publishing
it
i
fear
you
will
draw
on
me
the
particular
censure
of
two
classes
of
critics
the
novel
reader
will
reject
it
as
dull
the
religious
may
throw
it
aside
as
frivolous
the
one
will
accuse
it
of
excessive
strictness
the
other
of
censurable
levity
readers
of
the
former
description
must
be
satisfied
with
the
following
brief
and
general
answer
had
it
been
my
leading
object
to
have
indulged
in
details
that
have
amusement
only
for
their
end
it
might
not
have
been
difficult
to
have
produced
a
work
more
acceptable
to
the
tastes
accustomed
to
be
gratified
with
such
compositions
but
to
entertain
that
description
of
readers
makes
no
part
of
my
design
the
persons
with
whom
i
have
associated
in
my
excursion
were
principally
though
not
exclusively
the
family
of
a
country
gentleman
and
a
few
of
his
friends
a
narrow
field
and
unproductive
of
much
variety
the
generality
of
these
characters
move
in
the
quiet
and
regular
course
of
domestic
life
i
found
them
placed
in
no
difficult
situations
it
was
a
scene
rather
favorable
to
reflection
than
description
social
intercourse
and
not
striking
events
marked
the
daily
progress
of
my
visit
i
had
little
of
pathetic
scenes
or
trying
circumstances
to
work
on
my
own
feelings
or
by
the
relation
of
them
to
work
on
the
feelings
of
others
my
friend
house
resembled
the
reign
of
some
pacific
sovereigns
it
was
the
pleasantest
to
live
in
but
its
annals
were
not
the
most
splendid
to
record
the
periods
which
make
life
happy
do
not
always
render
history
brilliant
great
passions
therefore
and
great
trials
growing
out
of
them
as
i
did
not
witness
i
have
not
attempted
to
delineate
love
itself
appears
in
these
pages
not
as
an
ungovernable
impulse
but
as
a
sentiment
arising
out
of
qualities
calculated
to
inspire
attachment
in
persons
under
the
dominion
of
reason
and
religion
brought
together
by
the
ordinary
course
of
occurrences
in
a
private
family
party
the
familiar
conversations
of
this
little
society
comprehend
a
considerable
portion
of
this
slender
work
the
texture
of
the
narrative
is
so
slight
that
it
barely
serves
for
a
ground
into
which
to
weave
the
sentiments
and
observations
which
it
was
designed
to
introduce
it
may
not
be
unnecessary
to
anticipate
an
objection
to
which
these
conversations
may
sometimes
be
thought
liable
in
a
few
instances
the
speeches
may
be
charged
with
a
degree
of
stiffness
and
with
a
length
not
altogether
consistent
with
familiar
dialogue
i
must
apologize
for
this
by
observing
that
when
the
subjects
were
serious
the
dialogue
would
not
in
every
instance
bend
to
such
facilities
nor
break
into
such
small
parcels
as
may
easily
be
effected
in
the
discussion
of
topics
of
gayer
intercourse
but
it
is
time
to
meet
the
objections
of
the
more
pious
reader
if
any
such
should
condescend
to
peruse
this
little
performance
if
it
be
objected
that
religious
characters
have
been
too
industriously
brought
forward
and
their
faults
somewhat
too
severely
treated
let
it
be
remembered
that
while
it
is
one
of
the
principal
objects
of
the
work
to
animadvert
on
those
very
faults
it
has
never
been
done
with
the
insidious
design
of
depreciating
the
religion
but
with
the
view
by
exposing
the
fault
to
correct
the
practice
grossly
vicious
characters
have
seldom
come
in
my
way
but
i
had
frequent
occasion
to
observe
the
different
shapes
and
shades
of
error
in
various
descriptions
of
society
not
only
in
those
worldly
persons
who
do
not
quite
leave
religion
out
of
their
scheme
but
on
the
mistakes
and
inconsistencies
of
better
characters
and
even
on
the
errors
of
some
who
would
be
astonished
not
to
find
themselves
reckoned
altogether
religious
i
have
not
so
much
animadverted
on
the
unavoidable
faults
and
frailties
inseparable
from
humanity
even
in
the
best
characters
and
which
the
best
characters
most
sensibly
feel
and
most
feelingly
deplore
as
on
those
errors
which
are
often
tolerated
justified
and
in
some
instances
systematized
if
i
have
been
altogether
deceived
in
the
ambitious
hope
that
these
pages
may
not
be
entirely
useless
if
i
have
failed
in
my
endeavors
to
show
how
religion
may
be
brought
to
mix
with
the
concerns
of
ordinary
life
without
impairing
its
activity
lessening
its
cheerfulness
or
diminishing
its
usefulness
if
i
have
erred
in
fancying
that
material
defects
exist
in
fashionable
education
if
i
have
been
wrong
in
supposing
that
females
of
the
higher
class
may
combine
more
domestic
knowledge
with
more
intellectual
acquirement
that
they
may
be
at
the
same
time
more
knowing
and
more
useful
than
has
always
been
thought
necessary
or
compatible
in
short
if
i
shall
be
found
to
have
totally
disappointed
you
my
friend
in
your
too
sanguine
opinion
that
some
little
benefit
might
arise
from
the
publication
i
shall
rest
satisfied
with
a
low
and
negative
merit
i
must
be
content
with
the
humble
hope
that
no
part
of
these
volumes
will
be
found
injurious
to
the
important
interests
which
it
was
rather
in
my
wish
than
in
my
ability
to
advance
that
where
i
failed
in
effecting
good
little
evil
has
been
done
that
if
my
book
has
answered
no
valuable
purpose
it
has
at
least
not
added
to
the
number
of
those
publications
which
by
impairing
the
virtue
have
diminished
the
happiness
of
mankind
that
if
i
possessed
not
talents
to
promote
the
cause
of
christian
morals
i
possessed
an
abhorrence
of
those
principles
which
lead
to
their
contamination
c

c

chapter
i
have
been
sometimes
surprised
when
in
conversation
i
have
been
expressing
my
admiration
of
the
character
of
eve
in
her
state
of
innocence
as
drawn
by
our
immortal
poet
to
hear
objections
started
by
those
from
whom
of
all
critics
i
should
have
least
expected
it
the
ladies
i
confess
that
as
the
sophia
of
rousseau
had
her
young
imagination
captivated
by
the
character
of
fenelon
telemachus
so
i
early
became
enamored
of
that
of
milton
eve
i
never
formed
an
idea
of
conjugal
happiness
but
my
mind
involuntarily
adverted
to
the
graces
of
that
finished
picture
the
ladies
in
order
to
justify
their
censure
assert
that
milton
a
harsh
domestic
tyrant
must
needs
be
a
very
inadequate
judge
and
of
course
a
very
unfair
delineator
of
female
accomplishments
these
fair
cavilers
draw
their
inference
from
premises
from
which
i
have
always
been
accustomed
to
deduce
a
directly
contrary
conclusion
they
insist
that
it
is
highly
derogatory
from
the
dignity
of
the
sex
that
the
poet
should
affirm
that
it
is
the
perfection
of
the
character
of
a
wife
to
study
household
good
and
good
works
in
her
husband
to
promote
now
according
to
my
notion
of
household
good
which
does
not
include
one
idea
of
drudgery
or
servility
but
which
involves
a
large
and
comprehensive
scheme
of
excellence
i
will
venture
to
affirm
that
let
a
woman
know
what
she
may
yet
if
she
knows
not
this
she
is
ignorant
of
the
most
indispensable
the
most
appropriate
branch
of
female
knowledge
without
it
however
she
may
inspire
admiration
abroad
she
will
never
excite
esteem
nor
of
coarse
durable
affection
at
home
and
will
bring
neither
credit
nor
comfort
to
her
partner
the
domestic
arrangements
of
such
a
woman
as
filled
the
capacious
mind
of
the
poet
resemble
if
i
may
say
it
without
profaneness
those
of
providence
whose
she
is
her
wisdom
is
seen
in
its
effects
indeed
it
is
rather
felt
than
seen
it
is
sensibly
acknowledged
in
the
peace
the
happiness
the
virtue
of
the
component
parts
in
the
order
regularity
and
beauty
of
the
whole
system
of
which
she
is
the
moving
spring
the
perfection
of
her
character
as
the
divine
poet
intimates
does
not
arise
from
a
prominent
quality
or
a
showy
talent
or
a
brilliant
accomplishment
but
it
is
the
beautiful
combination
and
result
of
them
all
her
excellencies
consist
not
so
much
in
acts
as
in
habits
in
those
thousand
decencies
which
daily
flow
from
all
her
words
and
actions
a
description
more
calculated
than
any
i
ever
met
with
to
convey
an
idea
of
the
purest
conduct
resulting
from
the
best
principles
it
gives
an
image
of
that
tranquillity
smoothness
and
quiet
beauty
which
is
the
very
essence
of
perfection
in
a
wife
while
the
happily
chosen
verb
takes
away
any
impression
of
dullness
or
stagnant
torpor
which
the
idea
might
otherwise
suggest
but
the
offense
taken
by
the
ladies
against
the
uncourtly
bard
is
chiefly
occasioned
by
his
having
presumed
to
intimate
that
conjugal
obedience
is
woman
highest
honor
and
her
praise
this
is
so
nice
a
point
that
i
as
a
bachelor
dare
only
just
hint
that
on
this
delicate
question
the
poet
has
not
gone
an
inch
further
than
the
apostle
nay
paul
is
still
more
uncivilly
explicit
than
milton
if
however
i
could
hope
to
bring
over
to
my
side
critics
who
being
of
the
party
are
too
apt
to
prejudge
the
cause
i
would
point
out
to
them
that
the
supposed
harshness
of
the
observation
is
quite
done
away
by
the
recollection
that
this
scrupled
obedience
is
so
far
from
implying
degradation
that
it
is
connected
with
the
injunction
to
the
woman
to
promote
good
works
in
her
husband
an
injunction
surely
inferring
a
degree
of
influence
that
raises
her
condition
and
restores
her
to
all
the
dignity
of
equality
it
makes
her
not
only
the
associate
but
the
inspirer
of
his
virtues
but
to
return
to
the
economical
part
of
the
character
of
eve
and
here
she
exhibits
a
consummate
specimen
and
beautiful
model
of
domestic
skill
and
elegance
how
exquisitely
conceived
is
her
reception
and
entertainment
of
raphael
how
modest
and
yet
how
dignified
i
am
afraid
i
know
some
husbands
who
would
have
had
to
encounter
very
ungracious
looks
not
to
say
words
if
they
had
brought
home
even
an
angel
to
dinner
not
so
our
general
mother
her
dispatchful
looks
her
hospitable
thoughts
intent
what
choice
to
choose
for
delicacy
best
all
indicate
not
only
the
prompt
but
the
cheerful
obedience
though
her
repast
consisted
only
of
the
fruits
of
paradise
whatever
earth
all
bearing
mother
yields
yet
of
these
with
a
liberal
hospitality
she
gathers
tribute
large
and
on
the
board
heaps
with
unsparing
hand
the
finest
modern
lady
need
not
disdain
the
arrangement
of
her
table
which
was
so
contrived
as
not
to
mix
tastes
not
well
join
inelegant
but
bring
taste
after
taste
upheld
by
kindliest
change
it
must
however
i
fear
be
conceded
by
the
way
that
this
taste
taste
rather
holds
out
an
encouragement
to
second
courses
when
this
unmatched
trio
had
finished
their
repast
which
let
it
be
observed
before
they
tasted
adam
acknowledged
that
these
bounties
from
our
are
given
from
whom
all
perfect
good
descends
milton
with
great
liberality
to
that
sex
against
which
he
is
accused
of
so
much
severity
obligingly
permitted
eve
to
sit
much
longer
after
dinner
than
most
modern
husbands
would
allow
she
had
attentively
listened
to
all
the
historical
and
moral
subjects
so
divinely
discussed
between
the
first
angel
and
the
first
man
and
perhaps
there
can
scarcely
be
found
a
more
beautiful
trait
of
a
delicately
attentive
wife
than
she
exhibits
by
withdrawing
at
the
exact
point
of
propriety
she
does
not
retire
in
consequence
of
any
look
or
gesture
any
broad
sign
of
impatience
much
less
any
command
or
intimation
of
her
husband
but
with
the
ever
watchful
eye
of
vigilant
affection
and
deep
humility
when
by
his
countenance
he
entering
on
thoughts
abstruse
instructed
only
by
her
own
quick
intuition
of
what
was
right
and
delicate
she
withdrew
and
here
again
how
admirably
does
the
poet
sustain
her
intellectual
dignity
softened
by
a
most
tender
stroke
of
conjugal
affection
yet
went
she
not
as
not
with
such
discourse
delighted
or
not
capable
her
ear
of
what
was
high
such
pleasure
she
reserved
adam
relating
she
sole
auditress
on
perusing
however
the
which
her
absence
occasioned
methinks
i
hear
some
sprightly
lady
fresh
from
the
royal
institution
express
her
wonder
why
eve
should
be
banished
by
her
husband
from
raphael
fine
lecture
on
astronomy
which
follows
was
not
she
as
capable
as
adam
of
understanding
all
he
said
of
cycle
and
epicycle
orb
on
orb
if
however
the
imaginary
fair
objector
will
take
the
trouble
to
read
to
the
end
of
the
eighth
book
of
this
immortal
work
it
will
raise
in
her
estimation
both
the
poet
and
the
heroine
when
she
contemplates
the
just
propriety
of
her
being
absent
before
adam
enters
on
the
account
of
the
formation
beauty
and
attractions
of
his
wife
and
of
his
own
love
and
admiration
she
will
further
observe
in
her
progress
through
this
divine
poem
that
the
author
is
so
far
from
making
eve
a
mere
domestic
drudge
an
unpolished
housewife
that
he
pays
an
invariable
attention
even
to
external
elegance
in
his
whole
delineation
ascribing
grace
to
her
steps
and
dignity
to
her
gesture
he
uniformly
keeps
up
the
same
combination
of
intellectual
worth
and
polished
manners
for
softness
she
and
sweet
attractive
grace
and
her
husband
so
far
from
a
churlish
insensibility
to
her
perfections
politely
calls
her
daughter
of
god
and
man
eve
i
will
not
however
affirm
that
adam
or
even
milton
annexed
to
the
term
precisely
the
idea
with
which
it
is
associated
in
the
mind
of
a
true
lady
it
may
be
objected
to
the
poet
gallantry
that
he
remarks
how
beauty
is
excell
by
manly
grace
and
wisdom
which
alone
is
truly
fair
let
it
be
remembered
that
the
observation
proceeds
from
the
lips
of
eve
herself
and
thus
adds
to
her
other
graces
the
crowning
grace
of
humility
but
it
is
high
time
that
i
should
proceed
from
my
criticism
to
myself
the
connexion
and
of
course
the
transition
will
be
found
more
natural
than
may
appear
till
developed
by
my
slight
narrative
chapter
ii
i
am
a
young
man
not
quite
four
and
twenty
of
an
ancient
and
respectable
family
and
considerable
estate
in
one
of
the
northern
counties
soon
after
i
had
completed
my
studies
in
the
university
of
edinburgh
my
father
fell
into
a
lingering
illness
i
attended
him
with
an
assiduity
which
was
richly
rewarded
by
the
lessons
of
wisdom
and
the
example
of
piety
which
i
daily
received
from
him
after
languishing
about
a
year
i
lost
him
and
in
him
the
most
affectionate
father
the
most
enlightened
companion
and
the
most
christian
friend
the
grief
of
my
mother
was
so
poignant
and
so
lasting
that
i
could
never
prevail
on
myself
to
leave
her
even
for
the
sake
of
attaining
those
advantages
and
enjoying
those
pleasures
which
may
be
reaped
by
a
wider
range
of
observation
by
a
more
extended
survey
of
the
multifarious
tastes
habits
pursuits
and
characters
of
general
society
i
felt
with
gray
that
we
can
never
have
but
one
mother
and
postponed
from
time
to
time
the
moment
of
leaving
home
i
was
her
only
child
and
though
it
was
now
her
sole
remaining
wish
to
see
me
happily
married
yet
i
was
desirous
of
first
putting
myself
in
a
situation
which
might
afford
me
a
more
extensive
field
of
inquiry
before
i
ventured
to
take
so
irretrievable
a
step
a
step
which
might
perhaps
affect
my
happiness
in
both
worlds
but
time
did
not
hang
heavy
on
my
hands
if
i
had
little
society
i
had
many
books
my
father
had
left
me
a
copious
library
and
i
had
learnt
from
him
to
select
whatever
was
most
valuable
in
that
best
species
of
literature
which
tends
to
form
the
principles
the
understanding
the
taste
and
the
character
my
father
had
passed
the
early
part
of
his
life
in
the
gay
and
busy
world
and
our
domestic
society
in
the
country
had
been
occasionally
enlivened
by
visits
from
some
of
his
london
friends
men
of
sense
and
learning
and
some
of
them
men
of
piety
my
mother
when
she
was
in
tolerable
spirits
was
now
frequently
describing
the
kind
of
woman
whom
she
wished
me
to
marry
i
am
so
firmly
persuaded
charles
would
she
kindly
say
of
the
justness
of
your
taste
and
the
rectitude
of
your
principles
that
i
am
not
much
afraid
of
your
being
misled
by
the
captivating
exterior
of
any
woman
who
is
greatly
deficient
either
in
sense
or
conduct
but
remember
my
son
that
there
are
many
women
against
whose
characters
there
lies
nothing
very
objectionable
who
are
yet
little
calculated
to
taste
or
to
communicate
rational
happiness
do
not
indulge
romantic
ideas
of
excellence
remember
that
the
fairest
creature
is
a
fallen
creature
yet
let
not
your
standard
be
low
if
it
be
absurd
to
expect
perfection
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
expect
do
not
suffer
yourself
to
be
caught
by
a
shining
quality
till
you
know
it
is
not
counteracted
by
the
opposite
defect
be
not
taken
in
by
strictness
in
one
point
till
you
are
assured
there
is
no
laxity
in
others
in
character
as
in
architecture
proportion
is
beauty
the
education
of
the
present
race
of
females
is
not
very
favorable
to
domestic
happiness
for
my
own
part
i
call
education
not
that
which
smothers
a
woman
with
accomplishments
but
that
which
tends
to
consolidate
a
firm
and
regular
system
of
character
that
which
tends
to
form
a
friend
a
companion
and
a
wife
i
call
education
not
that
which
is
made
up
of
the
shreds
and
patches
of
useless
arts
but
that
which
inculcates
principles
polishes
taste
regulates
temper
cultivates
reason
subdues
the
passions
directs
the
feelings
habituates
to
reflection
trains
to
and
more
especially
that
which
refers
all
actions
feelings
sentiments
tastes
and
passions
to
the
love
and
fear
of
god
i
had
yet
had
little
opportunity
of
contrasting
the
charms
of
my
native
place
with
the
less
wild
and
romantic
beauties
of
the
south
i
was
passionately
fond
of
the
scenery
that
surrounded
me
which
had
never
yet
lost
that
power
of
pleasing
which
it
is
commonly
imagined
that
novelty
can
alone
confer
the
priory
a
handsome
gothic
mansion
stands
in
the
middle
of
a
park
not
extensive
but
beautifully
varied
behind
are
lofty
mountains
the
feet
of
which
are
covered
with
wood
that
descends
almost
to
the
house
on
one
side
a
narrow
cultivated
valley
winds
among
the
mountains
the
bright
variegated
tints
of
its
meadows
and
corn
fields
with
here
and
there
a
little
white
cottage
embosomed
in
trees
are
finely
contrasted
with
the
awful
and
impassable
fells
which
contain
it
an
inconsiderable
but
impetuous
river
rushes
from
the
mountains
above
through
this
unadorned
but
enchanting
little
valley
and
passes
through
the
park
at
the
distance
of
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
house
the
ground
falls
beautifully
down
to
it
and
on
the
other
side
is
a
fine
wood
of
birch
overhanging
the
river
which
is
here
crossed
by
a
small
rustic
bridge
after
being
enlarged
by
many
streams
from
the
neighboring
hills
it
runs
about
half
a
mile
to
the
lake
below
which
from
the
front
of
the
house
is
seen
in
full
beauty
it
is
a
noble
expanse
of
water
the
mountains
that
surround
it
are
some
of
them
covered
with
wood
some
skirted
with
cultivation
some
rocky
and
barren
to
the
water
edge
while
the
rugged
summits
of
them
all
present
every
variety
of
fantastic
outline
toward
the
head
of
the
lake
a
neat
little
village
ornaments
the
banks
and
wonderfully
harmonizes
with
the
simple
beauty
of
the
scene
at
an
opening
among
the
hills
a
view
is
caught
of
the
distant
country
a
wide
vale
richly
wooded
adorned
everywhere
with
towns
villages
and
gentlemen
houses
and
backed
by
sublime
mountains
rivaling
in
height
though
not
in
their
broken
and
alpine
forms
those
that
more
immediately
surround
us
while
i
was
thus
dividing
my
time
between
the
enjoyment
of
this
exquisite
scenery
my
books
the
care
of
my
affairs
my
filial
attentions
and
my
religious
duties
i
was
suddenly
deprived
of
my
inestimable
mother
she
died
the
death
of
the
righteous
addison
has
finely
touched
on
the
singular
sort
of
delicate
and
refined
tenderness
of
a
father
for
a
daughter
but
i
am
persuaded
that
there
is
no
affection
of
the
human
heart
more
exquisitely
pure
than
that
which
is
felt
by
a
grateful
son
toward
a
mother
who
fostered
his
infancy
with
fondness
watched
over
his
childhood
with
anxiety
and
his
youth
with
an
interest
compounded
of
all
that
is
tender
wise
and
pious
my
retirement
was
now
become
solitude
the
former
is
i
believe
the
best
state
for
the
mind
of
man
the
latter
almost
the
worst
in
complete
solitude
the
eye
wants
objects
the
heart
wants
attachments
the
understanding
wants
reciprocation
the
character
loses
its
tenderness
when
it
has
nothing
to
love
its
firmness
when
it
has
none
to
strengthen
it
its
sweetness
when
it
has
nothing
to
soothe
it
its
patience
when
it
meets
no
contradiction
its
humility
when
it
is
surrounded
by
dependants
and
its
delicacy
in
the
conversation
of
the
uninformed
where
the
intercourse
is
very
unequal
society
is
something
worse
than
solitude
i
had
naturally
a
keen
relish
for
domestic
happiness
and
this
propensity
had
been
cherished
by
what
i
had
seen
and
enjoyed
in
my
father
family
home
was
the
scene
in
which
my
imagination
had
pictured
the
only
delights
worthy
of
a
rational
feeling
intellectual
immortal
man
sole
bliss
of
paradise
which
has
survived
the
fall
this
inclination
had
been
much
increased
by
my
father
turn
of
conversation
he
often
said
to
me
i
know
your
domestic
propensities
and
i
know
therefore
that
the
whole
color
of
your
future
life
will
be
in
a
particular
manner
determined
by
the
turn
of
mind
of
the
woman
you
may
marry
were
you
to
live
in
the
busy
haunts
of
men
were
you
of
any
profession
or
likely
to
be
engaged
in
public
life
though
i
would
still
counsel
you
to
be
equally
careful
in
your
choice
yet
your
happiness
would
not
so
immediately
so
exclusively
depend
on
the
individual
society
of
a
woman
as
that
of
a
retired
country
gentleman
must
do
a
man
of
sense
who
loves
home
and
lives
at
home
requires
a
wife
who
can
and
will
be
at
half
the
expense
of
mind
necessary
for
keeping
up
the
cheerful
animated
elegant
intercourse
which
forms
so
great
a
part
of
the
bond
of
union
between
intellectual
and
persons
had
your
mother
been
a
woman
of
an
uninformed
inelegant
mind
virtuous
and
pious
as
she
is
what
abatement
must
there
have
been
in
the
blessings
of
my
lot
the
the
wife
may
entertain
your
company
but
it
is
only
the
informed
the
refined
the
cultivated
woman
who
can
entertain
yourself
and
i
presume
whenever
you
marry
you
will
marry
primarily
for
yourself
and
not
for
your
friends
you
will
want
a
companion
an
artist
you
may
hire
but
remember
charles
that
when
i
am
insisting
so
much
on
mental
delicacy
i
am
assuming
that
all
is
right
in
still
more
essential
points
do
not
be
contented
with
this
superstructure
till
you
have
ascertained
the
solidity
of
the
foundation
the
ornaments
which
decorate
do
not
support
the
edifice
guarded
as
you
are
by
christian
principles
and
confirmed
in
virtuous
habits
i
trust
you
may
safely
look
abroad
into
the
world
do
not
however
irrevocably
dispose
of
your
affections
till
you
have
made
the
visit
to
my
earliest
wisest
and
best
friend
stanley
i
am
far
from
desiring
that
your
friends
should
direct
your
choice
it
is
what
even
your
father
would
not
do
but
he
will
be
the
most
faithful
and
most
disinterested
of
counselors
i
resolved
now
for
a
few
months
to
leave
the
priory
the
seat
of
my
ancestors
to
make
a
tour
not
only
to
london
but
to
stanley
grove
in
hampshire
the
residence
of
my
father
friend
a
visit
i
was
about
to
make
with
him
just
before
his
last
illness
he
wished
me
to
go
alone
but
i
could
not
prevail
on
myself
to
desert
his
for
any
scheme
of
amusement
i
began
to
long
earnestly
for
the
pleasures
of
conversation
pleasures
which
in
our
small
but
social
and
select
circle
of
cultivated
friends
i
had
been
accustomed
to
enjoy
i
am
aware
that
certain
fine
men
would
ridicule
the
bare
mention
of
learned
and
polished
conversation
at
a
village
in
westmoreland
or
indeed
at
any
place
out
of
the
precincts
of
the
metropolis
just
as
a
london
physician
or
lawyer
smiles
superciliously
at
the
suggested
merits
of
a
professional
brother
in
a
provincial
town
good
sense
however
is
of
all
countries
and
even
knowledge
is
not
altogether
a
mere
local
advantage
these
and
not
the
topics
of
the
hour
furnish
the
best
raw
materials
for
working
up
an
improving
intercourse
it
must
be
confessed
however
as
i
have
since
found
that
for
giving
a
terseness
and
polish
to
conversation
for
rubbing
out
prejudices
for
correcting
egotism
for
keeping
out
of
sight
if
not
curing
it
for
bringing
a
man
to
condense
what
he
has
to
say
if
he
intends
to
be
listened
to
for
accustoming
him
to
endure
opposition
for
teaching
him
not
to
think
every
man
who
differs
from
him
in
matters
of
taste
a
fool
and
in
politics
a
knave
for
cutting
down
harangues
for
guarding
him
from
producing
as
novelties
and
inventions
what
has
been
said
a
thousand
times
for
quickness
of
allusion
which
brings
the
idea
before
you
without
detail
or
quotation
nothing
is
equal
to
the
miscellaneous
society
of
london
the
advantages
too
which
it
possesses
in
being
the
seat
of
the
court
the
parliament
and
the
courts
of
law
as
well
as
the
common
centre
of
arts
and
talents
of
every
kind
all
these
raise
it
above
every
other
scene
of
intellectual
improvement
or
colloquial
pleasure
perhaps
in
the
whole
world
but
this
was
only
the
secondary
motive
of
my
intended
migration
i
connected
with
it
the
hope
that
in
a
more
extended
survey
i
might
be
more
likely
to
select
a
deserving
companion
for
life
in
such
a
companion
said
i
as
i
drove
along
in
my
i
do
not
want
a
helen
a
saint
cecilia
or
a
madame
dacier
yet
she
must
be
elegant
or
i
should
not
love
her
sensible
or
i
should
not
respect
her
prudent
or
i
could
not
confide
in
her
or
she
could
not
educate
my
children
or
she
could
not
entertain
my
friends
or
i
should
offend
the
shade
of
my
mother
pious
or
i
should
not
be
happy
with
her
because
the
prime
comfort
in
a
companion
for
life
is
the
delightful
hope
that
she
will
be
a
companion
for
eternity
after
this
soliloquy
i
was
frightened
to
reflect
that
so
much
was
requisite
and
yet
when
i
began
to
consider
in
which
article
i
could
make
any
abatement
i
was
willing
to
persuade
myself
that
my
requisitions
were
moderate
chapter
iii
i
had
occasionally
visited
two
or
three
families
in
our
own
county
who
were
said
to
make
a
very
genteel
appearance
on
narrow
fortunes
as
i
was
known
not
to
consider
money
as
a
principal
consideration
it
had
often
been
intimated
to
me
what
excellent
wives
the
daughters
of
these
families
would
make
because
on
a
very
slender
allowance
their
appearance
was
as
elegant
as
that
of
women
of
ten
times
their
expectations
i
translated
this
respectable
appearance
into
a
language
not
the
most
favorable
as
i
instantly
inferred
and
afterward
was
convinced
that
this
personal
figure
was
made
by
the
sacrifice
of
their
whole
time
to
those
decorations
which
procured
them
credit
by
putting
their
outward
figure
on
a
par
with
the
most
affluent
if
a
girl
with
a
thousand
pounds
rivals
in
her
dress
one
with
ten
thousand
is
it
not
obvious
that
not
only
all
her
time
must
be
employed
but
all
her
money
devoted
to
this
one
object
nothing
but
the
clippings
and
parings
from
her
personal
adornments
could
enable
her
to
supply
the
demands
of
charity
and
these
sacrifices
it
is
evident
she
is
not
disposed
to
make
another
inducement
suggested
to
me
was
that
these
young
ladies
would
make
the
better
wives
because
they
had
never
been
corrupted
by
the
expensive
pleasures
of
london
and
had
not
been
spoiled
by
the
gay
scenes
of
dissipation
which
it
afforded
this
argument
would
have
weighed
powerfully
with
me
had
i
not
observed
that
they
never
abstained
from
any
amusement
in
the
country
that
came
within
their
reach
i
naturally
inferred
that
she
who
eagerly
grasped
at
every
petty
provincial
dissipation
would
with
increased
alacrity
have
plunged
into
the
more
alluring
gayeties
of
the
metropolis
had
it
been
in
her
power
i
thought
she
had
even
less
apology
to
plead
than
the
town
lady
the
fault
was
equal
while
the
temptation
was
less
and
she
who
was
as
dissipated
as
her
limited
bounds
permitted
where
there
was
little
to
attract
would
i
feared
be
as
dissipated
as
she
possibly
could
be
when
her
temptations
were
multiplied
and
her
facilities
increased
i
had
met
with
several
young
ladies
of
a
higher
description
daughters
of
our
country
gentlemen
a
class
which
furnishes
a
number
of
valuable
and
elegant
women
some
of
these
whom
i
knew
seemed
unexceptional
in
manner
and
in
mind
they
had
seen
something
of
the
world
without
having
been
spoiled
by
it
had
read
with
advantage
and
acquitted
themselves
well
in
the
duties
which
they
had
been
called
to
practice
but
i
was
withheld
from
cultivating
that
degree
of
intimacy
which
would
have
enabled
me
to
take
an
exact
measure
of
their
minds
by
the
injunction
of
my
father
that
i
would
never
attach
myself
to
any
woman
till
i
had
seen
and
consulted
stanley
this
direction
which
like
all
his
wishes
was
a
law
to
me
operated
as
a
sort
of
sedative
in
the
slight
intercourse
i
had
with
ladies
and
resolving
to
postpone
all
such
intimacy
as
might
have
led
to
attachment
i
did
not
allow
myself
to
come
near
enough
to
feel
with
interest
or
to
judge
with
decision
as
soon
as
i
got
to
town
i
visited
some
of
my
father
friends
i
was
kindly
received
for
his
sake
and
at
their
houses
soon
enlarged
the
sphere
of
my
acquaintance
i
was
concerned
to
remark
that
two
or
three
gentlemen
whom
i
had
observed
to
be
very
regular
in
their
attendance
on
public
worship
in
the
country
seldom
went
to
church
in
london
in
the
afternoon
never
religion
they
said
by
way
of
apology
was
entirely
a
thing
of
example
it
was
of
great
political
importance
society
was
held
together
by
the
restraints
it
imposed
on
the
lower
orders
when
they
were
in
the
country
it
was
highly
proper
that
their
tenants
and
workmen
should
have
the
benefit
of
their
example
but
in
london
the
case
was
different
where
there
were
so
many
churches
no
one
knew
whether
you
went
or
not
and
where
no
scandal
was
given
no
harm
was
done
as
this
was
a
logic
which
had
not
found
its
way
into
my
father
religion
i
was
not
convinced
by
it
i
remember
burke
speaking
of
the
english
who
were
so
humane
at
home
and
whom
he
unjustly
accused
of
wanting
humanity
in
india
says
that
the
humanity
of
britain
is
a
humanity
of
points
and
parallels
surely
the
religion
of
the
gentlemen
in
question
is
not
a
less
geographical
distinction
this
error
i
conceive
arises
from
religion
being
too
much
considered
as
a
mere
institution
of
decorum
of
convention
of
society
and
not
as
an
institution
founded
on
the
condition
of
human
nature
a
covenant
of
mercy
for
repairing
the
evils
which
sin
has
produced
it
springs
from
the
want
of
a
conviction
that
christianity
is
an
individual
as
well
as
general
concern
that
religion
is
a
personal
thing
previous
to
its
being
a
matter
of
example
that
a
man
is
not
infallibly
saved
or
lost
as
a
portion
of
any
family
or
any
church
or
any
community
but
that
as
he
is
individually
responsible
he
must
be
individually
brought
to
a
deep
and
humbling
sense
of
his
own
personal
wants
without
taking
any
refuge
in
the
piety
he
may
see
around
him
of
which
he
will
have
no
benefit
if
he
be
no
partaker
i
regretted
even
for
inferior
reasons
the
little
distinction
which
was
paid
to
this
sacred
day
to
say
nothing
of
the
elevating
views
which
the
soul
acquires
from
devoting
itself
to
its
proper
object
the
man
of
business
methinks
should
rejoice
in
its
return
the
politician
should
welcome
its
appearance
not
only
as
a
rest
from
anxiety
and
labor
but
as
an
occasion
of
cooling
and
quieting
the
mind
of
softening
its
irritation
of
allaying
its
ferment
and
thus
restoring
the
repaired
faculties
and
invigorated
spirits
to
the
demands
of
the
succeeding
week
in
a
frame
of
increased
aptitude
for
meeting
its
difficulties
and
encountering
its
duties
the
first
person
whom
i
visited
was
a
friendly
man
whom
i
had
occasionally
seen
in
the
north
as
i
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
he
was
religious
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
i
had
no
intention
of
looking
for
a
wife
in
his
family
i
however
thought
it
not
amiss
to
associate
a
little
with
persons
of
different
descriptions
that
by
a
wider
range
i
might
learn
to
correct
my
general
judgment
as
well
as
to
guide
my
particular
pursuit
nothing
it
is
true
would
tempt
me
to
select
a
woman
on
whose
pious
dispositions
i
could
not
form
a
reasonable
dependence
yet
to
come
at
the
reality
of
those
dispositions
was
no
easy
matter
i
had
heard
my
father
remark
that
he
had
more
than
once
known
a
girl
who
seemed
to
have
been
first
taught
of
heaven
and
afterward
supported
in
her
christian
course
under
almost
every
human
disadvantage
who
boldly
but
meekly
maintained
her
own
principles
under
all
the
hourly
temptations
and
oppositions
of
a
worldly
and
irreligious
family
and
who
had
given
the
best
evidence
of
her
piety
toward
god
by
her
patient
forbearance
toward
her
erring
friends
such
women
had
made
admirable
wives
when
they
were
afterward
transplanted
into
families
where
their
virtues
were
understood
and
their
piety
cherished
while
on
the
other
hand
he
had
known
others
who
accustomed
from
childhood
to
the
sober
habits
of
family
religion
under
pious
but
injudicious
parents
had
fallen
in
mechanically
with
the
domestic
practices
without
having
ever
been
instructed
in
christian
principles
or
having
ever
manifested
any
religious
tendencies
the
implantation
of
a
new
principle
never
having
been
inculcated
the
religious
habit
has
degenerated
into
a
mere
form
the
parents
acting
as
if
they
thought
that
religion
must
come
by
nature
or
infection
in
a
religious
family
these
girls
having
never
had
their
own
hearts
impressed
nor
their
own
characters
distinctly
considered
nor
individually
cultivated
but
being
taken
out
as
a
portion
from
the
mass
have
afterward
taken
the
cast
and
color
of
any
society
into
which
they
have
happened
to
be
thrown
and
they
who
before
had
lived
religiously
with
the
religious
have
afterward
assimilated
with
the
gay
and
dissipated
when
thus
thrown
into
their
company
as
cordially
as
if
they
had
never
been
habituated
to
better
things
at
dinner
there
appeared
two
young
ladies
daughters
of
my
friend
who
had
been
some
time
a
widower
i
placed
myself
between
them
for
the
purpose
of
prying
a
little
into
their
minds
while
the
rest
of
the
company
were
conversing
on
indifferent
subjects
having
formerly
heard
this
gentleman
deceased
wife
extolled
as
the
mirror
of
managers
and
the
arrangements
of
his
table
highly
commended
i
was
surprised
to
see
it
so
and
every
thing
wearing
marks
of
palpable
inelegance
though
no
epicure
i
could
not
forbear
observing
that
many
of
the
dishes
were
out
of
season
and
while
i
was
puzzling
my
head
for
a
solution
i
recollected
that
i
had
lately
read
in
a
most
respectable
periodical
work
a
paper
composed
i
believe
however
by
a
raw
recruit
of
that
corps
which
insisted
that
nothing
tended
to
make
ladies
so
useless
and
inefficient
in
the
as
the
study
of
the
dead
languages
i
jumped
to
the
conclusion
and
was
in
an
instant
persuaded
that
my
young
hostesses
must
not
only
be
perfect
mistresses
of
latin
but
the
was
so
ill
arranged
as
to
induce
me
to
give
them
full
credit
for
greek
also
finding
therefore
that
my
appetite
was
balked
i
took
comfort
in
the
certainty
that
my
understanding
would
be
well
regaled
and
after
secretly
regretting
that
learning
should
so
effectually
destroy
usefulness
i
was
resolved
to
derive
intellectual
comfort
from
this
too
classical
repast
turning
suddenly
to
the
eldest
lady
i
asked
her
at
once
if
she
did
not
think
virgil
the
finest
poet
in
the
world
she
blushed
and
thus
confirmed
me
in
the
opinion
that
her
modesty
was
equal
to
her
erudition
i
repeated
my
question
with
a
little
circumlocution
she
stared
and
said
she
had
never
heard
of
the
person
i
mentioned
but
that
she
had
read
tears
of
sensibility
and
rosa
matilda
and
sympathy
of
souls
and
too
civil
by
half
and
the
sorrows
of
werter
and
the
stranger
and
the
orphans
of
snowdon
yes
sir
joined
in
the
younger
sister
who
did
not
rise
to
so
high
a
pitch
of
literature
and
we
have
read
perfidy
punished
and
jemmy
and
jenny
jessamy
and
the
fortunate
footman
and
the
illustrious
chambermaid
i
blushed
and
stared
in
my
turn
and
here
the
conversation
through
the
difficulty
of
our
being
intelligible
to
each
other
dropped
and
i
am
persuaded
that
i
sunk
much
lower
in
their
esteem
for
not
being
acquainted
with
their
favorite
authors
than
they
did
in
mine
for
having
never
heard
of
virgil
i
arose
from
the
table
with
a
full
conviction
that
it
is
very
possible
for
a
woman
to
be
totally
ignorant
of
the
ordinary
but
indispensable
duties
of
common
life
without
knowing
one
word
of
latin
and
that
her
being
a
bad
companion
is
no
infallible
proof
of
her
being
a
good
economist
i
am
afraid
the
poor
father
saw
something
of
my
disappointment
in
my
countenance
for
when
we
were
alone
in
the
evening
he
observed
that
a
heavy
addition
to
his
other
causes
of
regret
for
the
loss
of
his
wife
was
her
excellent
management
of
his
family
i
found
afterward
that
though
she
had
brought
him
a
great
fortune
she
had
had
a
very
low
education
her
father
a
coarse
country
esquire
to
whom
the
pleasures
of
the
table
were
the
only
pleasures
for
which
he
had
any
relish
had
no
other
ambition
for
his
daughter
but
that
she
should
be
the
most
famous
housewife
in
the
country
he
gloried
in
her
culinary
perfections
which
he
understood
of
the
deficiencies
of
her
mind
he
had
not
the
least
perception
money
and
good
eating
he
owned
were
the
only
things
in
life
which
had
a
real
intrinsic
value
the
value
of
all
other
things
he
declared
existed
in
the
imagination
only
the
poor
lady
when
she
became
a
mother
and
was
brought
out
into
the
world
felt
keenly
the
deficiencies
of
her
own
education
the
dread
of
scylla
as
is
usual
wrecked
her
on
charybdis
her
first
resolution
as
soon
as
she
had
daughters
was
that
they
should
every
all
the
masters
who
teach
things
of
little
intrinsic
use
were
extravagantly
paid
for
supernumerary
attendance
and
as
no
one
in
the
family
was
capable
of
judging
of
their
improvements
their
progress
was
but
slow
though
they
were
taught
much
they
learned
but
little
even
of
these
unnecessary
things
and
of
things
necessary
they
learned
nothing
their
mother
was
not
aware
that
her
education
was
almost
as
much
calculated
to
gratify
the
senses
though
in
a
different
way
and
with
more
apparent
refinement
as
her
own
had
been
and
that
is
left
nearly
as
much
out
of
the
question
in
making
an
ordinary
artist
as
in
making
a
good
cook
chapter
iv
from
my
fondness
for
conversation
my
imagination
had
been
early
fired
with
johnson
remark
that
there
is
no
pleasure
on
earth
comparable
to
the
full
flow
of
london
i
who
since
i
had
quitted
college
had
seldom
had
my
mind
refreshed
but
with
the
petty
rills
and
penurious
streams
of
knowledge
which
country
society
afforded
now
expected
to
meet
it
in
a
strong
and
rapid
current
fertilizing
wherever
it
flowed
producing
in
abundance
the
rich
fruits
of
argument
and
the
gay
flowers
of
rhetoric
i
looked
for
an
uninterrupted
course
of
profit
and
delight
i
flattered
myself
that
every
dinner
would
add
to
my
stock
of
images
that
every
debate
would
clear
up
some
difficulty
every
discussion
elucidate
some
truth
that
every
allusion
would
be
purely
classical
every
sentence
abound
with
instruction
and
every
period
be
pointed
with
wit
on
the
tiptoe
of
expectation
i
went
to
dine
with
sir
john
belfield
in
i
looked
at
my
watch
fifty
times
i
thought
it
would
never
be
six
i
did
not
care
to
show
my
country
breeding
by
going
too
early
to
incommode
my
friend
nor
my
town
breeding
by
going
too
late
and
spoiling
his
dinner
sir
john
is
a
valuable
man
and
next
to
stanley
stood
highest
in
my
father
esteem
for
his
mental
accomplishments
and
correct
morals
as
i
knew
he
was
remarkable
for
assembling
at
his
table
men
of
sense
taste
and
learning
my
expectations
of
pleasure
were
very
high
here
at
least
said
i
as
i
heard
the
name
of
one
clever
man
announced
after
another
here
at
least
i
can
not
fail
to
find
the
feast
of
reason
and
the
flow
of
soul
here
at
least
all
the
energies
of
my
mind
will
be
brought
into
exercise
from
this
society
i
shall
carry
away
documents
for
the
improvement
of
my
taste
i
shall
treasure
up
hints
to
enrich
my
understanding
and
collect
aphorisms
for
the
conduct
of
life
at
first
there
was
no
fair
opportunity
to
introduce
any
conversation
beyond
the
topics
of
the
day
and
to
those
it
must
be
confessed
this
eventful
period
gives
a
new
and
powerful
interest
i
should
have
been
much
pleased
to
have
had
my
country
politics
rectified
and
any
prejudices
which
i
might
have
contracted
removed
or
softened
could
the
discussion
have
been
carried
on
without
the
frequent
interruption
of
the
youngest
man
in
the
company
this
gentleman
broke
in
on
every
remark
by
descanting
successively
on
the
merits
of
the
various
dishes
and
if
it
be
true
that
experience
only
can
determine
the
judgment
he
gave
proof
of
that
best
right
to
peremptory
decision
by
not
trusting
to
delusive
theory
but
by
actually
eating
of
every
dish
at
table
his
animadversions
were
uttered
with
the
gravity
of
a
german
philosopher
and
the
science
of
a
french
cook
if
any
of
his
opinions
happened
to
be
controverted
he
quoted
in
confirmation
of
his
own
judgment
des
which
he
assured
us
was
the
most
valuable
work
that
had
appeared
in
france
since
the
revolution
the
author
of
this
book
he
seemed
to
consider
of
as
high
authority
in
the
science
of
eating
as
coke
or
hale
in
that
of
jurisprudence
or
quintilian
in
the
art
of
criticism
to
the
credit
of
the
company
however
be
it
spoken
he
had
the
whole
of
this
topic
to
himself
the
rest
of
the
party
were
in
general
of
quite
a
different
calibre
and
as
little
acquainted
with
his
favorite
author
as
he
probably
was
with
theirs
the
lady
of
the
house
was
perfectly
amiable
and
her
dinner
was
excellent
and
every
thing
about
her
had
an
air
of
elegance
and
splendor
of
course
she
completely
escaped
the
disgrace
of
being
thought
a
scholar
but
not
the
suspicion
of
having
a
very
good
taste
i
longed
for
the
removal
of
the
cloth
and
was
eagerly
anticipating
the
pleasure
and
improvement
which
awaited
me
as
soon
as
the
servants
were
beginning
to
withdraw
we
got
into
a
sort
of
attitude
of
conversation
all
except
the
eulogist
of
des
gourmands
who
wrapping
himself
up
in
the
comfortable
consciousness
of
his
own
superior
judgment
and
a
little
piqued
that
he
had
found
neither
support
nor
opposition
the
next
best
thing
to
a
professed
talker
he
seemed
to
have
a
perfect
indifference
to
all
topics
except
that
on
which
he
had
shown
so
much
eloquence
with
so
little
effect
the
last
tray
was
now
carried
out
the
last
lingering
servant
had
retired
i
was
beginning
to
listen
with
all
my
powers
of
attention
to
an
ingenious
gentleman
who
was
about
to
give
an
interesting
account
of
egypt
where
he
had
spent
a
year
and
from
whence
he
was
lately
returned
he
was
just
got
to
the
catacombs
when
on
a
sudden
open
fly
with
impetuous
recoil
and
jarring
sound
the
mahogany
folding
doors
and
in
at
once
struggling
who
should
be
first
rushed
half
a
dozen
children
lovely
fresh
gay
and
noisy
this
sudden
and
violent
irruption
of
the
pretty
barbarians
necessarily
caused
a
total
interruption
of
conversation
the
sprightly
creatures
ran
round
the
table
to
choose
where
they
would
sit
at
length
this
great
difficulty
of
courts
and
cabinets
choice
of
was
settled
the
little
things
were
jostled
in
between
the
ladies
who
all
contended
who
should
get
possession
of
the
one
was
in
raptures
with
the
rosy
cheeks
of
a
sweet
girl
she
held
in
her
lap
a
second
exclaimed
aloud
at
the
beautiful
lace
with
which
the
frock
of
another
was
trimmed
and
which
she
was
sure
mamma
had
given
her
for
being
good
a
profitable
and
doubtless
a
lasting
and
inseparable
association
was
thus
formed
in
the
child
mind
between
lace
and
goodness
a
third
cried
out
look
at
the
pretty
angel
do
but
observe
her
bracelets
are
as
blue
as
her
eyes
did
you
ever
see
such
a
match
surely
lady
belfield
cried
a
fourth
you
carried
the
eyes
to
the
shop
or
there
must
have
been
a
shade
of
difference
i
myself
who
am
passionately
fond
of
children
eyed
the
sweet
little
rebels
with
complacency
notwithstanding
the
unseasonableness
of
their
interruption
at
last
when
they
were
all
disposed
of
i
resumed
my
inquiries
about
the
of
the
mummies
but
the
grand
dispute
who
should
have
oranges
and
who
should
have
almonds
and
raisins
soon
raised
such
a
clamor
that
it
was
impossible
to
hear
my
egyptian
friend
this
great
contest
was
however
at
length
settled
and
i
was
returning
to
the
antiquities
of
memphis
when
the
important
point
who
should
have
red
wine
and
who
should
have
white
who
should
have
half
a
glass
and
who
a
whole
one
set
us
again
in
an
uproar
sir
john
was
visibly
uneasy
and
commanded
silence
during
this
interval
of
peace
i
gave
up
the
catacombs
and
took
refuge
in
the
pyramids
but
i
had
no
sooner
proposed
my
question
about
the
serpent
said
to
be
found
in
one
of
them
than
the
son
and
heir
a
fine
little
fellow
just
six
years
old
reaching
out
his
arm
to
dart
an
apple
across
the
table
at
his
sister
roguishly
intending
to
overset
her
glass
unluckily
overthrew
his
own
brimful
of
port
wine
the
whole
contents
were
discharged
on
the
elegant
drapery
of
a
nymph
all
was
now
agitation
and
distress
and
disturbance
and
confusion
the
gentlemen
ringing
for
napkins
the
ladies
assisting
the
dripping
fair
one
each
vying
with
the
other
who
should
recommend
the
most
approved
specific
for
getting
out
the
stain
of
red
wine
and
comforting
the
sufferer
by
stories
of
similar
misfortunes
the
poor
little
culprit
was
dismissed
and
all
difficulties
and
disasters
seemed
at
last
surmounted
but
you
can
not
heat
up
again
an
interest
which
has
been
so
often
cooled
the
thread
of
conversation
had
been
so
frequently
broken
that
i
despaired
of
seeing
it
tied
together
again
i
sorrowfully
gave
up
catacombs
pyramids
and
serpent
and
was
obliged
to
content
myself
with
a
little
desultory
chat
with
my
next
neighbor
sorry
and
disappointed
to
glean
only
a
few
scattered
ears
where
i
had
expected
so
abundant
a
harvest
and
the
day
from
which
i
had
promised
myself
so
much
benefit
and
delight
passed
away
with
a
very
slender
acquisition
of
either
chapter
i
went
almost
immediately
after
at
the
invitation
of
ranby
to
pass
a
few
days
at
his
villa
at
hampstead
and
ranby
were
esteemed
pious
persons
but
having
risen
to
great
affluence
by
a
sudden
turn
of
fortune
in
a
commercial
engagement
they
had
a
little
and
not
a
little
disposition
to
ascribe
an
undue
importance
to
wealth
this
i
should
have
thought
more
pardonable
under
their
circumstances
had
i
not
expected
that
religion
would
in
this
respect
have
more
than
supplied
the
deficiencies
of
education
their
religion
however
consisted
almost
exclusively
in
a
disproportionate
zeal
for
a
very
few
doctrines
and
though
they
were
far
from
being
immoral
in
their
own
practice
yet
in
their
discourse
they
affected
to
undervalue
morality
this
was
indeed
more
particularly
the
case
with
the
lady
whose
chief
object
of
discourse
seemed
to
be
to
convince
me
of
her
great
superiority
to
her
husband
in
polemical
skill
her
chaste
conversation
certainly
was
not
coupled
with
fear
in
one
respect
she
was
the
very
reverse
of
those
pharisees
who
were
scrupulously
exact
about
their
petty
observances
ranby
was
on
the
contrary
anxious
about
a
very
few
important
particulars
and
exonerated
herself
from
the
necessity
of
all
inferior
attentions
she
was
strongly
attached
to
one
or
two
preachers
and
discovered
little
candor
for
all
others
or
for
those
who
attended
them
nay
she
somewhat
doubted
of
the
soundness
of
the
faith
of
her
friends
and
acquaintance
who
would
not
incur
great
inconvenience
to
attend
one
or
other
of
her
favorites
ranby
table
was
more
than
hospitably
good
there
was
not
the
least
suspicion
of
latin
here
the
eulogist
of
female
ignorance
might
have
dined
in
comfortable
security
against
the
intrusion
and
vanity
of
erudition
she
had
three
daughters
not
unpleasing
young
women
but
i
was
much
concerned
to
observe
that
they
were
not
only
dressed
to
the
very
extremity
of
fashion
but
their
drapery
was
as
transparent
as
short
and
as
scanty
there
was
as
sedulous
a
disclosure
of
their
persons
and
as
great
a
redundancy
of
ornaments
as
i
had
seen
in
the
gayest
circles
expect
not
perfection
said
my
good
mother
but
look
for
this
principle
my
parents
had
not
only
taught
me
in
the
closet
but
had
illustrated
by
their
deportment
in
the
family
and
in
the
world
they
observed
a
uniform
correctness
in
their
general
demeanor
they
were
not
over
anxious
about
character
for
its
own
sake
but
they
were
tenderly
vigilant
not
to
bring
any
reproach
on
the
christian
name
by
imprudence
negligence
or
inconsistency
even
in
small
things
custom
said
my
mother
can
never
alter
the
immutable
nature
of
right
fashion
can
never
justify
any
practice
which
is
improper
in
itself
and
to
dress
indecently
is
as
great
an
offence
against
purity
and
modesty
when
it
is
the
fashion
as
when
it
is
obsolete
there
should
be
a
line
of
demarcation
somewhere
in
the
article
of
dress
and
appearance
christian
mothers
should
make
a
stand
they
should
not
be
so
unreasonable
as
to
expect
that
a
young
girl
will
of
herself
have
courage
to
oppose
the
united
temptations
of
fashion
without
and
the
secret
prevalence
of
corruption
within
and
authority
should
be
called
in
where
admonition
fails
the
conversation
after
dinner
took
a
religious
turn
ranby
was
not
unacquainted
with
the
subject
and
expressed
herself
with
energy
on
many
serious
points
i
could
have
been
glad
however
to
have
seen
her
views
a
little
more
practical
and
her
spirit
a
little
less
censorious
i
saw
she
took
the
lead
in
debate
and
that
ranby
submitted
to
act
as
subaltern
but
whether
his
meekness
was
the
effect
of
piety
or
fear
i
could
not
at
that
time
determine
she
protested
vehemently
against
all
dissipation
in
which
i
cordially
joined
her
though
i
hope
with
something
less
intemperance
of
manner
and
less
acrimony
against
those
who
pursued
it
i
began
however
to
lose
sight
of
the
errors
of
the
daughters
dress
in
the
pleasure
i
felt
at
conversing
with
so
pious
a
mother
of
a
family
for
pious
she
really
was
though
her
piety
was
a
little
debased
by
coarseness
and
not
a
little
disfigured
by
asperity
i
was
sorry
to
observe
that
the
young
ladies
not
only
took
no
part
in
the
conversation
but
that
they
did
not
even
seem
to
know
what
was
going
on
and
i
must
confess
the
in
which
it
was
conducted
was
not
calculated
to
make
the
subject
interesting
the
girls
sat
jogging
and
whispering
each
other
and
got
away
as
fast
as
they
could
as
soon
as
they
were
withdrawn
there
sir
said
the
mother
are
three
girls
who
will
make
three
excellent
wives
they
were
never
at
a
ball
or
a
play
in
their
lives
and
yet
though
i
say
it
who
should
not
say
it
they
are
as
highly
accomplished
as
any
ladies
at
st
james
i
cordially
approved
the
former
part
of
her
assertion
and
bowed
in
silence
to
the
latter
i
took
this
opportunity
of
inquiring
what
had
been
her
mode
of
religious
instruction
for
her
daughters
but
though
i
put
the
question
with
much
caution
and
deference
she
looked
displeased
and
said
she
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
do
a
great
deal
in
that
way
all
these
things
must
come
from
above
it
was
not
human
endeavors
but
divine
grace
which
made
christians
i
observed
that
the
truth
appeared
to
be
that
divine
grace
human
endeavors
seemed
most
likely
to
accomplish
that
great
end
she
replied
that
experience
was
not
on
my
side
for
that
the
children
of
religious
parents
were
not
always
religious
i
allowed
that
it
was
too
true
i
knew
that
she
drew
her
instances
from
two
or
three
of
her
own
friends
who
while
they
discovered
much
earnestness
about
their
own
spiritual
interests
had
almost
totally
neglected
the
religious
cultivation
of
their
children
the
daughters
in
particular
had
been
suffered
to
follow
their
own
devices
and
to
waste
their
days
in
company
of
their
own
choosing
and
in
the
most
frivolous
manner
what
do
ye
more
than
others
is
an
interrogation
which
this
negligence
has
frequently
suggested
nay
professing
serious
piety
if
ye
do
not
more
than
those
who
profess
it
not
ye
do
less
i
took
the
liberty
to
remark
that
though
there
was
no
such
thing
as
hereditary
holiness
no
entail
of
goodness
yet
the
almighty
had
promised
in
the
scriptures
many
blessings
to
the
offspring
of
the
righteous
he
never
meant
however
that
religion
was
to
be
transferred
arbitrarily
like
an
but
the
promise
was
accompanied
with
conditions
and
injunctions
the
directions
were
express
and
frequent
to
inculcate
early
and
late
the
great
truths
of
religion
nay
it
was
enforced
with
all
the
minuteness
of
detail
precept
upon
precept
line
upon
line
here
a
little
and
there
a
little
at
all
times
and
seasons
walking
by
the
way
and
sitting
in
the
house
i
hazarded
the
assertion
that
it
would
be
found
that
where
the
children
of
pious
parents
turned
out
ill
there
had
been
some
mistake
some
neglect
or
some
fault
on
the
part
of
the
parents
that
they
had
not
used
the
right
methods
i
observed
that
i
thought
it
did
not
at
all
derogate
from
the
sovereignty
of
the
almighty
that
he
appointed
certain
means
to
accomplish
certain
ends
and
that
the
adopting
these
in
conformity
to
his
appointment
and
dependence
on
his
blessing
seemed
to
be
one
of
the
cases
in
which
we
should
prove
our
faith
by
our
obedience
i
found
i
had
gone
too
far
she
said
with
some
warmth
that
she
was
not
wanting
in
any
duty
to
her
daughters
she
set
them
a
good
example
and
she
prayed
daily
for
their
conversion
i
highly
commended
her
for
both
but
risked
the
observation
that
praying
without
instilling
principles
might
be
as
inefficacious
as
instruction
without
prayer
that
it
was
like
a
husbandman
who
should
expect
that
praying
for
sunshine
should
produce
a
crop
of
corn
in
a
field
where
not
one
grain
had
been
sown
god
indeed
effect
this
but
he
does
not
do
it
and
the
means
being
of
his
own
appointment
his
omnipotence
is
not
less
exerted
by
his
directing
certain
effects
to
follow
certain
causes
than
it
would
be
by
any
arbitrary
act
as
it
was
evident
that
she
did
not
choose
to
quarrel
with
me
she
contented
herself
with
saying
coldly
that
she
perceived
i
was
a
and
had
but
a
low
view
of
divine
things
at
tea
i
found
the
young
ladies
took
no
more
interest
in
the
conversation
than
they
had
done
at
dinner
but
sat
whispering
and
laughing
and
netting
white
silk
gloves
till
they
were
summoned
to
the
harpsichord
despairing
of
getting
on
with
them
in
company
i
proposed
a
walk
in
the
garden
i
now
found
them
as
willing
to
talk
as
destitute
of
any
thing
to
say
their
conversation
was
vapid
and
frivolous
they
laid
great
stress
on
small
things
they
seemed
to
have
no
shades
in
their
understanding
but
used
the
strongest
terms
for
the
commonest
occasions
and
admiration
was
excited
by
things
hardly
worthy
to
command
attention
they
were
extremely
glad
and
extremely
sorry
on
subjects
not
calculated
to
excite
affections
of
any
kind
they
were
animated
about
trifles
and
indifferent
on
things
of
importance
they
were
i
must
confess
frank
and
but
it
was
evident
that
as
they
were
too
open
to
have
any
thing
to
conceal
so
they
were
too
uninformed
to
have
any
thing
to
produce
and
i
was
resolved
not
to
risk
my
happiness
with
a
woman
who
could
not
contribute
her
full
share
toward
spending
a
wet
winter
cheerfully
in
the
country
the
next
day
all
the
hours
from
breakfast
to
dinner
were
devoted
to
the
harp
i
had
the
vanity
to
think
that
this
sacrifice
of
time
was
made
in
compliment
to
me
as
i
had
professed
to
like
music
till
i
found
that
all
their
mornings
were
spent
in
the
same
manner
and
the
only
fruit
of
their
education
which
seemed
to
be
used
to
any
purpose
was
that
after
their
family
devotions
in
the
evening
they
sung
and
played
a
hymn
this
was
almost
the
only
sign
they
gave
of
intellectual
or
spiritual
life
they
attended
morning
prayers
if
they
were
dressed
before
the
bell
rang
one
morning
when
they
did
not
appear
till
late
they
were
reproved
by
their
father
ranby
said
she
should
be
more
angry
with
them
for
their
irregularity
were
it
not
that
ranby
obstinately
persisted
in
reading
a
printed
form
which
she
was
persuaded
could
not
do
any
body
much
good
the
poor
man
who
was
really
well
disposed
very
properly
defended
himself
by
saying
that
he
hoped
his
own
heart
went
along
with
every
word
he
read
and
as
to
his
family
he
thought
it
much
more
beneficial
for
them
to
join
in
an
excellent
composition
of
a
judicious
divine
than
to
attend
to
any
such
crude
rhapsody
as
he
should
be
able
to
produce
whose
education
had
not
qualified
him
to
lead
the
devotions
of
others
i
had
never
heard
him
venture
to
make
use
of
his
understanding
before
and
i
continued
to
find
it
much
better
than
i
had
at
first
given
him
credit
for
the
lady
observed
with
some
asperity
that
where
there
were
and
it
superseded
the
necessity
of
learning
in
vindication
of
my
own
good
breeding
i
should
observe
that
in
my
little
debates
with
ranby
to
which
i
was
always
challenged
by
her
i
never
lost
sight
of
that
becoming
example
of
the
son
of
cato
who
when
about
to
deliver
sentiments
which
might
be
thought
too
assuming
in
so
young
a
man
introduced
his
admonitions
with
the
modest
preface
remember
what
our
oft
has
taught
us
i
without
quoting
the
son
of
the
sage
of
utica
constantly
adduced
the
paternal
authority
for
opinions
which
might
savor
too
much
of
arrogance
without
such
a
sanction
i
observed
in
the
course
of
my
visit
that
made
no
part
of
ranby
religious
plan
she
fancied
i
believe
that
it
savored
of
works
and
of
works
she
was
evidently
afraid
she
talked
as
if
activity
were
useless
and
exertion
unnecessary
and
as
if
like
inanimate
matter
we
had
nothing
to
do
but
sit
still
and
be
shone
upon
i
assured
her
that
though
i
depended
on
the
mercy
of
god
through
the
merits
of
his
son
for
salvation
as
entirely
as
she
could
do
yet
i
thought
that
almighty
grace
so
far
from
setting
aside
diligent
exertion
was
the
principle
which
promoted
it
that
salvation
is
in
no
part
of
scripture
represented
as
attainable
by
the
indolent
christian
if
i
might
couple
such
contradictory
terms
that
i
had
been
often
awfully
struck
with
the
plain
declarations
that
the
kingdom
of
heaven
suffereth
violence
strive
to
enter
in
at
the
strait
gate
whatsoever
thy
hand
findeth
to
do
do
it
with
all
thy
might
give
diligence
to
make
your
calling
sure
work
out
your
own
salvation
to
this
labor
this
watchfulness
this
sedulity
of
endeavor
the
crown
of
life
is
expressly
promised
and
salvation
is
not
less
the
free
gift
of
god
because
he
has
annexed
certain
conditions
to
our
obtaining
it
the
more
i
argued
the
more
i
found
my
reputation
decline
yet
to
argue
she
compelled
me
i
really
believe
she
was
sincere
but
she
was
ill
informed
governed
by
feelings
and
impulses
rather
than
by
the
plain
express
rule
of
scripture
it
was
not
that
she
did
not
read
scripture
but
she
interpreted
it
her
own
way
built
opinions
on
insulated
texts
did
not
compare
scripture
with
scripture
except
as
it
concurred
to
strengthen
her
bias
she
considered
with
a
disproportionate
fondness
those
passages
which
supported
her
preconceived
opinions
instead
of
being
uniformly
governed
by
the
general
tenor
and
spirit
of
the
sacred
page
she
had
far
less
reverence
for
the
preceptive
than
for
the
doctrinal
parts
because
she
did
not
sufficiently
consider
faith
as
an
operative
influential
principle
nor
did
she
conceive
that
the
sublimest
doctrines
involve
deep
practical
consequences
she
did
not
consider
the
government
of
the
tongue
nor
the
command
of
her
passions
as
forming
any
material
part
of
the
christian
character
her
zeal
was
fiery
because
her
temper
was
so
and
her
charity
was
cold
because
it
was
an
expensive
propensity
to
keep
warm
among
the
perfections
of
the
character
she
did
not
consider
his
being
meek
and
lowly
as
an
example
the
influence
of
which
was
to
extend
to
her
she
considered
it
indeed
as
but
not
as
a
distinction
she
was
very
apt
to
make
in
all
her
practical
dissertations
and
in
her
interpretation
of
scripture
in
the
evening
ranby
was
lamenting
in
general
and
rather
customary
terms
her
own
exceeding
sinfulness
ranby
said
you
accuse
yourself
rather
too
heavily
my
dear
you
have
sins
to
be
sure
and
pray
what
sins
have
i
mr
ranby
said
she
turning
upon
him
with
so
much
quickness
that
the
poor
man
started
nay
said
he
meekly
i
did
not
mean
to
offend
you
so
far
from
it
that
hearing
you
condemn
yourself
so
grievously
i
intended
to
comfort
you
and
to
say
that
except
a
few
faults
and
pray
what
faults
interrupted
she
continuing
to
speak
however
lest
he
should
catch
an
interval
to
tell
them
i
defy
you
ranby
to
produce
one
my
dear
replied
he
as
you
charged
yourself
with
all
i
thought
it
would
be
letting
you
off
cheaply
by
naming
only
two
or
three
such
as
here
fearing
matters
would
go
too
far
i
interposed
and
softening
things
as
much
as
i
could
for
the
lady
said
i
conceived
that
ranby
meant
that
though
she
partook
of
the
general
corruption
here
ranby
interrupting
me
with
more
spirit
than
i
thought
he
possessed
said
general
corruption
sir
must
be
the
source
of
particular
corruption
i
did
not
mean
that
my
wife
was
worse
than
other
women
worse
ranby
worse
cried
she
ranby
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
not
minding
her
went
on
as
she
is
always
insisting
that
the
whole
species
is
corrupt
she
can
not
help
allowing
that
she
herself
has
not
quite
escaped
the
infection
now
to
be
a
sinner
in
the
gross
and
a
saint
in
the
detail
that
is
to
have
all
sins
and
no
faults
is
a
thing
i
do
not
quite
comprehend
after
he
had
left
the
room
which
he
did
as
the
shortest
way
of
allaying
the
storm
she
apologized
for
him
said
he
was
a
man
and
acted
up
to
the
little
light
he
had
but
added
that
he
was
unacquainted
with
religious
feelings
and
knew
little
of
the
nature
of
conversion
ranby
i
found
seems
to
consider
christianity
as
a
kind
of
and
therefore
thinks
it
superfluous
to
speak
on
serious
subjects
to
any
but
the
initiated
if
they
do
not
the
she
gives
them
up
as
blind
and
dead
she
thinks
she
can
only
make
herself
intelligible
to
those
to
whom
certain
peculiar
phrases
are
familiar
and
though
her
friends
may
be
correct
devout
and
both
doctrinally
and
practically
pious
yet
if
they
can
not
catch
a
certain
mystic
meaning
if
there
is
not
a
sympathy
of
intelligence
between
her
and
them
if
they
do
not
fully
conceive
of
impressions
and
can
not
respond
to
mysterious
communications
she
holds
them
unworthy
of
intercourse
with
her
she
does
not
so
much
insist
on
high
moral
excellence
as
the
criterion
of
their
worth
as
on
their
own
account
of
their
internal
feelings
she
holds
very
cheap
that
gradual
growth
in
piety
which
is
in
reality
no
less
the
effect
of
divine
grace
than
those
instantaneous
conversions
which
she
believes
to
be
so
common
she
can
not
be
persuaded
that
of
every
advance
in
piety
of
every
improvement
in
virtue
of
every
illumination
of
the
understanding
of
every
amendment
in
the
heart
of
every
rectification
of
the
will
the
spirit
of
god
is
no
less
the
author
because
it
is
progressive
than
if
it
were
sudden
it
is
true
omnipotence
can
when
he
pleases
still
produce
these
instantaneous
effects
as
he
has
sometimes
done
but
as
it
is
not
his
established
or
common
mode
of
operation
it
seems
vain
and
rash
presumptuously
to
wait
for
these
miraculous
interferences
an
implicit
dependence
however
on
such
interferences
is
certainly
more
gratifying
to
the
genius
of
enthusiasm
than
the
anxious
vigilance
the
fervent
prayer
the
daily
struggle
the
sometimes
scarcely
perceptible
though
constant
progress
of
the
christian
such
a
christian
is
fully
aware
that
his
heart
requires
as
much
watching
in
the
more
advanced
as
in
the
earliest
stages
of
his
religious
course
he
is
cheerful
in
a
hope
and
looks
not
for
ecstasies
till
that
hope
be
swallowed
up
in
fruition
thankful
if
he
feel
in
his
heart
a
growing
love
to
god
and
an
increasing
submission
to
his
will
though
he
is
unconscious
of
visions
and
unacquainted
with
any
revelation
but
that
which
god
has
made
in
his
word
he
remembers
and
he
derives
consolation
from
the
remembrance
that
his
saviour
in
his
most
gracious
and
soothing
invitation
to
the
heavy
laden
has
mercifully
promised
rest
but
he
has
no
where
promised
rapture
chapter
vi
but
to
return
to
ranby
daughters
is
this
said
i
to
myself
when
i
compared
the
inanity
of
the
life
with
the
seriousness
of
the
discourse
and
contrasted
the
vacant
way
in
which
the
day
was
spent
with
the
decent
and
devout
manner
in
which
it
was
begun
and
ended
i
recollected
that
under
the
early
though
imperfect
sacred
institution
the
fire
of
the
morning
and
evening
sacrifice
was
never
suffered
to
be
extinguished
during
the
day
though
ranby
would
have
thought
it
a
little
heathenish
to
have
had
her
daughters
instructed
in
polite
literature
and
to
have
filled
a
leisure
hour
in
reading
to
her
a
useful
book
that
was
not
professedly
religious
she
felt
no
compunction
at
their
waste
of
time
or
the
trifling
pursuits
in
which
the
day
was
suffered
to
spend
itself
the
when
they
were
weary
of
the
harp
copying
some
indifferent
drawings
gilding
a
set
of
and
netting
white
gloves
and
veils
seemed
to
fill
up
the
whole
business
of
these
immortal
beings
of
these
christians
for
whom
it
had
been
solemnly
engaged
that
they
should
manfully
fight
under
christ
banner
on
a
further
acquaintance
i
was
much
more
inclined
to
lay
the
blame
on
their
education
than
their
dispositions
i
found
them
not
only
but
charitably
disposed
but
their
charities
were
small
and
casual
often
ill
applied
and
always
without
a
plan
they
knew
nothing
of
the
state
character
or
wants
of
the
neighboring
poor
and
it
had
never
been
pointed
out
to
them
that
the
instruction
of
the
young
and
ignorant
made
any
part
of
the
duty
of
the
rich
toward
them
when
i
once
ventured
to
drop
a
hint
on
this
subject
to
ranby
she
drily
said
there
were
many
other
ways
of
doing
good
to
the
poor
besides
exposing
her
daughters
to
the
probability
of
catching
diseases
and
the
certainty
of
getting
dirt
by
such
visits
her
subscription
was
never
wanting
when
she
was
that
the
object
was
deserving
as
i
suspected
that
she
a
little
her
own
charity
i
could
not
forbear
observing
that
i
did
not
think
it
demanded
a
combination
of
all
the
virtues
to
entitle
a
poor
sick
wretch
to
a
dinner
and
though
i
durst
not
quote
so
light
an
authority
as
hamlet
to
her
i
could
not
help
saying
to
myself
every
man
his
due
and
who
shall
o
if
god
dealt
so
rigidly
with
us
if
he
waited
to
bestow
his
ordinary
blessings
till
we
were
good
enough
to
deserve
them
who
would
be
clothed
who
would
be
fed
who
would
have
a
roof
to
shelter
him
it
was
not
that
she
gave
nothing
away
but
she
had
a
great
dislike
to
relieve
any
but
those
of
her
own
religious
persuasion
though
her
redeemer
laid
down
his
life
for
all
people
nations
and
languages
she
will
only
lay
down
her
money
for
a
very
limited
number
of
a
very
limited
class
to
be
religious
is
not
claim
sufficient
on
her
bounty
they
must
be
religious
in
a
particular
way
the
miss
ranbys
had
not
been
habituated
to
make
any
systematic
provision
for
regular
charity
or
for
any
of
those
accidental
calamities
for
which
the
purse
of
the
affluent
should
always
be
provided
and
being
very
expensive
in
their
persons
they
had
often
not
a
sixpence
to
bestow
when
the
most
deserving
case
presented
itself
this
must
frequently
happen
where
there
is
no
specific
fund
for
charity
which
should
be
included
in
the
general
arrangement
of
expenses
and
the
exercise
of
benevolence
not
be
left
to
depend
on
the
accidental
state
of
the
purse
if
no
new
trinket
happened
to
be
wanted
these
young
ladies
were
liberal
to
any
application
though
always
without
judging
of
its
merits
by
their
own
eyes
and
ears
but
if
there
was
a
competition
between
a
sick
family
and
a
new
brooch
the
brooch
was
sure
to
carry
the
day
this
would
not
have
been
the
case
had
they
been
habituated
to
visit
themselves
the
abodes
of
penury
and
woe
their
flexible
young
hearts
would
have
been
wrought
upon
by
the
actual
sight
of
miseries
the
impression
of
which
was
feeble
when
it
reached
their
ears
at
a
distance
surrounded
as
they
were
with
all
the
softnesses
and
accommodations
of
luxurious
life
they
would
do
what
they
could
they
hoped
it
was
not
so
bad
as
was
represented
they
fell
into
the
usual
way
of
pacifying
their
consciences
by
their
regrets
and
brought
themselves
to
believe
that
their
sympathy
with
the
suffering
was
an
atonement
for
their
not
relieving
it
i
observed
with
concern
during
my
visit
how
little
the
christian
temper
seemed
to
be
considered
as
a
part
of
the
christian
religion
this
appeared
in
the
daily
concerns
of
this
high
professor
an
opinion
contradicted
a
person
of
different
religious
views
commended
the
smallest
opposition
to
her
will
the
intrusion
of
an
unseasonable
visitor
even
an
imperfection
in
the
dressing
of
some
dish
at
table
such
trifles
not
only
discomposed
her
but
the
discomposure
was
manifested
with
a
vehemence
which
she
was
not
aware
was
a
fault
nor
did
she
seem
at
all
sensible
that
her
religion
was
ever
to
be
resorted
to
but
on
great
occasions
forgetting
that
great
occasions
but
rarely
occur
in
common
life
and
that
these
small
passes
at
which
the
enemy
is
perpetually
entering
the
true
christian
will
vigilantly
guard
i
observed
in
ranby
one
striking
inconsistency
while
she
considered
it
as
forming
a
complete
line
of
separation
from
the
world
that
she
and
her
daughters
abstained
from
public
places
she
had
no
objection
to
their
indemnifying
themselves
for
this
forbearance
by
devoting
so
monstrous
a
disproportion
of
their
time
to
that
very
amusement
which
constitutes
so
principal
a
part
of
diversion
abroad
the
time
which
is
redeemed
from
what
is
wrong
is
of
little
value
if
not
dedicated
to
what
is
right
and
it
is
not
enough
that
the
doctrines
of
the
gospel
furnish
a
subject
for
discussion
if
they
do
not
furnish
a
principle
of
action
one
of
the
most
obvious
defects
which
struck
me
in
this
and
two
or
three
other
families
whom
i
afterward
visited
was
the
want
of
companionableness
in
the
daughters
they
did
not
seem
to
form
a
part
of
the
family
compact
but
made
a
kind
of
distinct
branch
of
themselves
surely
when
only
the
parents
and
a
few
select
friends
are
met
together
in
a
family
way
the
daughters
should
contribute
their
portion
to
enliven
the
domestic
circle
they
were
always
ready
to
sing
and
to
play
but
did
not
take
the
pains
to
produce
themselves
in
conversation
but
seemed
to
carry
on
a
distinct
intercourse
by
herding
and
whispering
and
laughing
together
in
some
women
who
seemed
to
be
possessed
of
good
ingredients
they
were
so
ill
mixed
up
together
as
not
to
produce
an
elegant
interesting
companion
it
appeared
to
me
that
three
of
the
grand
inducements
in
the
choice
of
a
wife
are
that
a
man
may
have
a
directress
for
his
family
a
preceptress
for
his
children
and
a
companion
for
himself
can
it
be
honestly
affirmed
that
the
present
habits
of
domestic
life
are
generally
favorable
to
the
union
of
these
three
essentials
yet
which
of
them
can
a
man
of
sense
and
principle
consent
to
relinquish
in
his
conjugal
prospects

of

when

trace
the

the

of
the

the

of
the

when

trebling
dangers
multiplying

annihilating

when
in

you
meet
these
gloomy

at
the

hecatomb
at
the

the
splendid
spectacle
when
you
hear

this

this
at

is
a
place
in
which
there
is
neither

how
noble

of

civilized
globe
suspended
while
two
intellectual
gladiators
are
thrusting
each
to
give
the
other
a
fall
and
to
show
his
own
strength
would
you
not
lament
the
littleness
of
the

infirmities
of
the
good

the

of

you
not
soaring

apostrophize

or
the
son
of

that
thou
regardest

but
to
descend
to
my
individual
concerns
among
my
acquaintance
i
visited
two
separate
families
where
the
daughters
were
remarkably
attractive
and
more
than
usually
endowed
with
beauty
sense
and
elegance
but
i
was
deterred
from
following
up
the
acquaintance
by
observing
in
each
family
practices
which
though
very
different
almost
equally
revolted
me
in
one
where
the
young
ladies
had
large
fortunes
they
insinuated
themselves
into
the
admiration
and
invited
the
familiarity
of
young
men
by
attentions
the
most
flattering
and
civilities
the
most
alluring
when
they
had
made
sure
of
their
aim
and
the
admirers
were
encouraged
to
make
proposals
the
ladies
burst
out
into
a
loud
laugh
wondered
what
the
man
could
mean
they
never
dreamt
of
any
thing
more
than
common
politeness
then
petrified
them
with
distant
looks
and
turned
about
to
practice
the
same
arts
on
others
the
other
family
in
which
i
thought
i
had
secured
an
agreeable
intimacy
i
instantly
deserted
on
observing
the
gracious
and
engaging
reception
given
by
the
ladies
to
more
than
one
libertine
of
the
most
notorious
profligacy
the
men
were
handsome
and
elegant
and
fashionable
and
had
figured
in
newspapers
and
courts
of
justice
this
degrading
popularity
rather
attracted
than
repelled
attention
and
while
the
guilty
associates
in
their
crimes
were
shunned
with
abhorrence
by
these
very
ladies
the
specious
undoers
were
not
only
received
with
complaisance
but
there
was
a
sort
of
competition
who
should
be
most
strenuous
in
their
endeavors
to
attract
them
surely
women
of
fashion
can
hardly
make
a
more
corrupt
use
of
influence
a
talent
for
which
they
will
be
peculiarly
accountable
surely
mere
personal
purity
can
hardly
deserve
the
name
of
virtue
in
those
who
can
sanction
notoriously
vicious
characters
which
their
reprobation
if
it
could
not
reform
would
at
least
degrade
on
a
further
acquaintance
i
found
sir
john
and
lady
belfield
to
be
persons
of
much
worth
they
were
candid
generous
and
sincere
they
saw
the
errors
of
the
world
in
which
they
lived
but
had
not
resolution
to
emancipate
themselves
from
its
shackles
they
partook
indeed
very
sparingly
of
its
diversions
not
so
much
because
they
suspected
their
evil
tendency
as
because
they
were
weary
of
them
and
because
they
had
better
resources
in
themselves
indeed
it
is
wonderful
that
more
people
from
mere
good
sense
and
just
taste
without
the
operation
of
any
religious
consideration
do
not
when
the
first
ardor
is
cooled
perceive
the
futility
of
what
is
called
pleasure
and
decline
it
as
the
man
declines
the
amusements
of
the
child
but
fashionable
society
produces
few
persons
who
like
the
of
king
david
assign
their
fourscore
years
as
a
reason
for
no
longer
delighting
in
the
voice
of
singing
men
and
singing
women
sir
john
and
lady
belfield
however
kept
a
large
general
acquaintance
and
it
is
not
easy
to
continue
to
associate
with
the
world
without
retaining
something
of
its
spirit
their
standard
of
morals
was
high
compared
with
that
of
those
with
whom
they
lived
but
when
the
standard
of
the
gospel
was
suggested
they
drew
in
a
little
and
thought
might
be
carried
too
there
was
nothing
in
their
practice
which
made
it
their
interest
to
hope
that
christianity
might
not
be
true
they
both
assented
to
its
doctrines
and
lived
in
a
kind
of
general
hope
of
its
final
promises
but
their
views
were
neither
correct
nor
elevated
they
were
contented
to
generalize
the
doctrines
of
scripture
and
though
they
venerated
its
awful
truths
in
the
aggregate
they
rather
took
them
upon
trust
than
labored
to
understand
them
or
to
imbue
their
minds
with
the
spirit
of
them
many
a
high
professor
however
might
have
blushed
to
see
how
carefully
they
exercised
not
a
few
christian
dispositions
how
kind
and
patient
they
were
how
favorable
in
their
construction
of
the
actions
of
others
how
charitable
to
the
necessitous
how
exact
in
veracity
and
how
tender
of
the
reputation
of
their
neighbor
sir
john
had
been
early
hurt
by
living
so
much
with
men
of
the
world
with
wits
politicians
and
philosophers
this
though
he
had
escaped
the
contagion
of
false
principles
had
kept
back
the
growth
of
such
as
were
true
men
versed
in
the
world
and
abstracted
from
all
religious
society
begin
in
time
a
little
to
suspect
whether
their
own
religious
opinions
may
not
possibly
be
wrong
or
at
least
rigid
when
they
see
them
so
opposite
to
those
of
persons
to
whose
judgment
they
are
accustomed
to
look
up
in
other
points
he
found
too
that
in
the
society
in
which
he
lived
the
reputation
of
religion
detracted
much
from
that
of
talents
and
a
man
does
not
care
to
have
his
understanding
questioned
by
those
in
whose
opinion
he
wishes
to
stand
well
this
apprehension
did
not
indeed
drive
him
to
renounce
his
principles
but
it
led
him
to
conceal
them
and
that
piety
which
is
forcibly
kept
out
of
sight
which
has
nothing
to
fortify
and
every
thing
to
repel
it
is
too
apt
to
decline
his
marriage
with
an
amiable
woman
whose
virtues
and
graces
attached
him
to
his
own
home
drew
him
off
from
the
most
dangerous
of
his
prior
connections
this
union
had
at
once
improved
his
character
and
augmented
his
happiness
if
lady
belfield
erred
it
was
through
excess
of
kindness
and
candor
her
kindness
led
to
the
too
great
indulgence
of
her
children
and
her
candor
to
the
too
favorable
construction
of
the
errors
of
her
acquaintance
she
was
the
very
reverse
of
my
hampstead
friend
whereas
ranby
thought
hardly
any
body
would
be
saved
lady
belfield
comforted
herself
that
hardly
any
body
was
in
danger
this
opinion
was
not
taken
up
as
a
palliative
to
quiet
her
conscience
on
account
of
the
sins
of
her
own
conduct
for
her
conduct
was
remarkably
correct
but
it
sprang
from
a
natural
sweetness
of
temper
joined
to
a
mind
not
sufficiently
informed
and
guided
by
scriptural
truth
she
was
candid
and
teachable
but
as
she
could
not
help
seeing
that
she
had
more
religion
than
most
of
her
acquaintance
she
felt
a
secret
complacency
in
observing
how
far
her
principles
rose
above
theirs
instead
of
an
humbling
conviction
of
how
far
her
own
fell
below
the
requisitions
of
the
gospel
the
fundamental
error
was
that
she
had
no
distinct
view
of
the
corruptions
of
human
nature
she
often
lamented
the
weaknesses
and
vices
of
individuals
but
thought
all
vice
an
incidental
not
a
radical
mischief
the
effect
of
thoughtlessness
and
casual
temptation
she
talked
with
discrimination
of
the
faults
of
some
of
her
children
but
while
she
rejoiced
in
the
happier
dispositions
of
the
others
she
never
suspected
that
they
had
all
brought
into
the
world
with
them
any
natural
tendency
to
evil
and
thought
it
cruel
to
suppose
that
such
innocent
little
things
had
any
such
wrong
propensities
as
education
would
not
effectually
cure
in
every
thing
the
complete
contrast
of
ranby
as
the
latter
thought
education
could
do
nothing
lady
belfield
thought
it
would
do
every
thing
that
there
was
no
good
tendency
which
it
would
not
bring
to
perfection
and
no
corruption
which
it
could
not
completely
eradicate
on
the
operation
of
a
higher
influence
she
placed
too
little
dependence
while
ranby
rested
in
an
unreasonable
trust
on
an
interference
not
warranted
by
scripture
in
regard
to
her
children
lady
belfield
was
led
by
the
strength
of
her
affection
to
extreme
indulgence
she
encouraged
no
vice
in
them
but
she
did
not
sufficiently
check
those
indications
which
are
the
seeds
of
vice
she
reproved
the
actual
fault
but
never
thought
of
implanting
a
principle
which
might
extirpate
the
evil
from
whence
the
fault
sprung
so
that
the
individual
error
and
the
individual
correction
were
continually
recurring
as
ranby
i
had
observed
seldom
quoted
any
sacred
writer
but
paul
i
remarked
that
lady
belfield
admired
almost
exclusively
ecclesiastes
proverbs
and
the
historical
books
of
the
bible
of
the
epistles
that
of
james
was
her
favorite
the
others
she
thought
chiefly
if
not
entirely
applicable
to
the
circumstances
of
the
jews
and
pagans
to
the
converts
from
among
whom
they
were
addressed
if
she
entertained
rather
an
awful
reverence
for
the
doctrinal
parts
than
an
earnest
wish
to
study
them
it
arose
from
the
common
mistake
of
believing
that
they
were
purely
speculative
without
being
aware
of
their
deep
practical
importance
but
if
these
two
ladies
were
diametrically
opposite
to
each
other
in
certain
points
both
were
frequently
right
in
what
they
assumed
and
both
wrong
only
in
what
they
rejected
each
contended
for
one
half
of
that
which
will
not
save
when
disjointed
from
the
other
but
which
when
united
to
it
makes
up
the
complete
christian
character
lady
belfield
who
was
if
i
may
so
speak
constitutionally
charitable
almost
thought
that
heaven
might
be
purchased
by
charity
she
inverted
the
valuable
superstructure
of
good
works
and
laid
them
as
her
foundation
and
while
ranby
would
not
perhaps
much
have
blamed
moses
for
breaking
the
tables
of
the
law
had
he
only
demolished
the
second
lady
belfield
would
have
saved
the
second
as
the
more
important
of
the
two
lady
belfield
had
less
vanity
than
any
woman
i
ever
knew
who
was
not
governed
by
a
very
strict
religious
principle
her
modesty
never
courted
the
admiration
of
the
world
but
her
timidity
too
much
dreaded
its
censure
she
would
not
do
a
wrong
thing
to
obtain
any
applause
but
she
omitted
some
right
ones
from
the
dread
of
blame
chapter
viii
the
house
of
sir
john
belfield
was
become
a
pleasant
kind
of
home
to
me
he
and
his
lady
seldom
went
out
in
an
evening
happy
in
each
other
and
in
their
children
though
they
lived
much
with
the
rational
they
associated
as
little
as
they
thought
possible
with
the
racketing
world
yet
being
known
to
be
generally
at
home
they
were
exposed
to
the
inroads
of
certain
invaders
called
fine
ladies
who
always
afraid
of
being
too
early
for
their
parties
are
constantly
on
the
watch
how
to
disburden
themselves
for
the
intermediate
hour
of
the
heavy
commodity
a
raw
material
which
as
they
seldom
work
up
at
home
they
are
always
willing
to
truck
against
the
time
of
their
more
domestic
acquaintance
now
as
these
last
always
something
to
do
it
is
an
unfair
traffic
all
the
reciprocity
is
on
one
side
to
borrow
the
expression
of
an
illustrious
statesman
and
the
barter
is
as
disadvantageous
to
the
sober
as
that
of
the
honest
negroes
who
exchange
their
and
ivory
for
the
beads
and
bits
of
glass
of
the
wily
english
these
nightly
irruptions
though
sometimes
inconvenient
to
my
friends
were
of
use
to
me
as
they
enabled
me
to
see
and
judge
more
of
the
gay
world
than
i
could
have
done
without
going
in
search
of
it
a
risk
which
i
thought
bore
no
proportion
to
the
gain
it
was
like
learning
the
language
of
the
enemy
country
at
home
one
evening
when
we
were
sitting
happily
alone
in
the
library
lady
belfield
working
at
her
embroidery
cheerfully
joining
in
our
little
discussions
and
comparing
our
peaceful
pleasures
with
those
pursued
by
the
occupiers
of
the
countless
carriages
which
were
tearing
up
the
streets
or
jostling
each
other
at
the
door
of
the
next
house
where
a
grand
assembly
was
collecting
its
myriads
sir
john
asked
what
should
be
the
evening
book
then
rising
he
took
down
from
the
shelf
akenside
pleasures
of
imagination
is
it
said
he
as
soon
as
he
sat
down
the
rage
for
novelty
or
a
real
degeneracy
of
taste
that
we
now
so
seldom
hear
of
a
poet
who
when
i
was
a
boy
was
the
admiration
of
every
man
who
had
a
relish
for
true
genius
i
can
not
defend
his
principles
since
in
a
work
of
which
is
professedly
the
object
he
has
overlooked
his
a
subject
which
one
wonders
did
not
force
itself
upon
him
as
so
congenial
to
the
sublimity
of
his
genius
whatever
his
religious
views
might
have
been
but
to
speak
of
him
only
as
a
poet
a
work
which
abounds
in
a
richer
profusion
of
images
and
a
more
variegated
luxuriance
of
expression
than
the
pleasures
of
imagination
can
not
easily
be
found
the
flimsy
metre
of
our
day
seems
to
add
fresh
value
to
his
sinewy
verse
we
have
no
happier
master
of
poetic
numbers
none
who
better
knew
to
build
the
lofty
rhyme
the
condensed
vigor
so
indispensable
to
blank
verse
the
skillful
variation
of
the
pause
the
masterly
structure
of
the
period
and
all
the
occult
mysteries
of
the
art
can
perhaps
be
best
learned
from
akenside
if
he
could
have
conveyed
to
thomson
his
melody
and
rhyme
and
thomson
would
have
paid
him
back
in
perspicuity
and
transparency
of
meaning
how
might
they
have
enriched
each
other
i
confess
said
i
in
reading
akenside
i
have
now
and
then
found
the
same
passage
at
once
enchanting
and
unintelligible
as
it
happens
to
many
frequenters
of
the
opera
the
music
always
transports
but
the
words
are
not
always
understood
i
then
desired
my
friend
to
gratify
us
with
the
first
book
of
the
pleasures
of
imagination
sir
john
is
a
passionate
lover
of
poetry
in
which
he
has
a
fine
taste
he
read
it
with
much
spirit
and
feeling
especially
these
truly
classical
lines
alone
bear
witness
earth
and
heaven
the
living
fountains
in
itself
contains
of
beauteous
and
sublime
here
hand
in
hand
sit
paramount
the
graces
here
enthroned
celestial
venus
with
divinest
airs
invites
the
soul
to
joy
the
reputation
of
this
exquisite
passage
said
he
laying
down
the
book
is
established
by
the
consenting
suffrage
of
all
men
of
taste
though
by
the
critical
countenance
you
are
beginning
to
put
on
you
look
as
if
you
had
a
mind
to
attack
it
so
far
from
it
said
i
that
i
know
nothing
more
splendid
in
the
whole
mass
of
our
poetry
and
i
feel
almost
guilty
of
high
treason
against
the
majesty
of
the
sublimer
muses
in
the
remark
i
am
going
to
hazard
on
the
celebrated
lines
which
follow
the
poet
object
through
this
and
the
two
following
pages
is
to
establish
the
infinite
superiority
of
mind
over
unconscious
matter
even
in
its
fairest
forms
the
idea
is
as
just
as
the
execution
is
beautiful
so
also
is
his
supreme
elevation
of
intellect
over
greatness
of
bulk
or
symmetry
of
parts
nothing
again
can
be
finer
than
his
subsequent
preference
of
the
powers
of
genius
and
design
over
even
the
stupendous
range
of
planets
suns
and
adamantine
spheres
he
proceeds
to
ransack
the
stores
of
the
mental
and
the
moral
world
as
he
had
done
the
world
of
matter
and
with
a
pen
dipped
in
hippocrene
opposes
to
the
latter
the
charms
of
virtuous
friendship
etc
the
candid
blush
of
him
who
strives
with
fortune
to
be
just
all
the
mild
majesty
of
private
life
the
graceful
tear
that
streams
from
others
woes
why
charles
said
sir
john
i
am
glad
to
find
you
the
enthusiastic
eulogist
of
the
passage
of
which
i
suspected
you
were
about
to
be
the
saucy
censurer
censure
replied
i
is
perhaps
too
strong
a
term
for
any
part
especially
the
most
admired
part
of
this
fine
poem
i
need
not
repeat
the
lines
on
which
i
was
going
to
risk
a
slight
observation
they
live
in
the
mind
and
memory
of
every
lover
of
the
muses
i
will
read
the
next
passage
however
said
sir
john
that
i
may
be
better
able
to
controvert
your
criticism
look
then
abroad
through
nature
to
the
range
of
planets
suns
and
adamantine
spheres
wheeling
unshaken
through
the
void
immense
and
speak
oh
man
does
the
capacious
scene
with
half
that
kindling
majesty
dilate
thy
strong
conception
as
when
brutus
rose
refulgent
from
the
stroke
of
cæsar
fate
amid
the
crowd
of
patriots
and
his
arm
aloft
extending
like
eternal
jove
when
guilt
brings
down
the
thunder
call
aloud
on
tully
name
and
shook
his
crimson
steel
and
bade
the
father
of
his
country
hail
for
lo
the
tyrant
prostrate
in
the
dust
and
rome
again
is
free
what
a
grand
and
powerful
passage
said
sir
john
i
acknowledge
it
said
i
but
is
it
as
just
as
it
is
grand
vrai
est
le
seul
is
it
a
fair
and
direct
opposition
between
mind
and
matter
the
poet
could
not
have
expressed
the
image
more
nobly
but
might
he
not
out
of
the
abundant
treasures
of
his
opulent
mind
have
chosen
it
with
more
felicity
is
an
act
of
murder
even
of
an
usurper
as
happily
contrasted
with
the
organization
of
matter
as
the
other
beautiful
instances
i
named
and
which
he
goes
on
to
select
the
superiority
of
mental
beauty
is
the
point
he
is
establishing
and
his
elaborate
preparation
leads
you
to
expect
all
his
other
instances
to
be
drawn
from
pure
mental
excellence
his
other
exemplifications
are
general
this
is
particular
they
are
a
class
this
is
only
a
variety
i
question
if
milton
who
was
at
least
as
ardent
a
champion
for
liberty
and
as
much
of
a
as
akenside
would
have
used
this
illustration
milton
though
he
often
insinuates
a
political
stroke
in
his
great
poem
always
i
think
generalizes
whatever
had
been
his
principles
or
at
whatever
period
he
had
written
i
question
when
he
wanted
to
describe
the
overthrow
of
authority
by
the
rebel
angels
if
he
would
have
illustrated
it
by
cromwell
seizing
the
mace
or
the
decapitation
of
charles
much
less
if
he
would
have
selected
those
two
instances
as
the
triumph
of
mind
over
matter
but
said
sir
john
you
forget
that
akenside
professedly
adopts
the
language
of
cicero
in
his
second
philippic
he
then
read
the
note
beginning
with
cæsare
interfecto
etc
true
said
i
i
am
not
arguing
the
matter
as
a
point
of
fact
but
as
a
point
of
just
application
i
pass
over
the
comparison
of
brutus
with
jove
which
by
the
way
would
have
become
tully
better
than
akenside
but
which
tully
would
have
perhaps
thought
too
bold
cicero
adorns
his
oration
with
this
magnificent
description
he
relates
it
as
an
event
the
other
uses
it
as
an
illustration
of
that
to
which
i
humbly
conceive
it
does
not
exactly
apply
the
orator
paints
the
violent
death
of
a
hero
the
poet
adopts
the
description
of
the
violent
death
or
rather
of
the
stroke
which
caused
it
to
illustrate
the
perfection
of
intellectual
grandeur
after
all
it
is
as
much
a
party
question
as
a
poetical
one
a
question
on
which
the
critic
will
be
apt
to
be
guided
in
his
decision
by
his
politics
rather
than
by
his
taste
the
splendor
of
the
passage
however
will
inevitably
dazzle
the
feeling
reader
till
it
produce
the
common
effect
of
excessive
brightness
that
of
somewhat
blinding
the
beholder
chapter
ix
while
we
were
thus
pleasantly
engaged
the
servant
announced
fentham
and
a
fashionable
looking
woman
about
the
middle
of
life
rather
youthfully
dressed
and
not
far
from
handsome
made
her
appearance
instead
of
breaking
forth
into
the
usual
modish
jargon
she
politely
entered
into
the
subject
in
which
she
found
us
engaged
envied
lady
belfield
the
happiness
of
elegant
quiet
which
she
herself
might
have
been
equally
enjoying
at
her
own
house
and
professed
herself
a
warm
admirer
of
poetry
she
would
probably
have
professed
an
equal
fondness
for
metaphysics
geometry
military
tactics
or
the
arabic
language
if
she
had
happened
to
have
found
us
employed
in
the
study
of
either
from
poetry
the
transition
to
painting
was
easy
and
natural
fentham
possessed
all
the
phraseology
of
connoisseurship
and
asked
me
if
i
was
fond
of
pictures
i
professed
the
delight
i
took
in
them
in
strong
that
is
in
true
terms
she
politely
said
that
fentham
had
a
very
tolerable
collection
of
the
best
masters
and
particularly
a
titian
which
she
would
be
happy
to
have
the
honor
of
showing
me
next
morning
i
bowed
my
thankful
assent
she
appointed
the
hour
and
soon
after
looking
at
her
watch
said
she
was
afraid
she
must
leave
the
delights
of
such
a
select
and
interesting
society
for
a
far
less
agreeable
party
when
she
was
gone
i
expressed
my
obligations
to
her
politeness
and
anticipated
the
pleasure
i
should
have
in
seeing
her
pictures
she
is
much
more
anxious
that
you
should
see
her
said
lady
belfield
smiling
the
kindness
is
not
disinterested
take
care
of
your
heart
sir
john
rather
gravely
said
it
is
with
reluctance
that
i
ever
say
any
thing
to
the
prejudice
of
any
body
that
i
receive
in
my
house
but
as
the
son
of
my
valued
friend
i
think
it
fair
to
tell
you
that
this
vigilant
matron
keeps
a
keen
look
out
after
all
young
men
of
fortune
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
the
titian
has
been
made
the
bait
to
catch
a
promising
acquaintance
indeed
it
is
now
grown
so
stale
that
had
you
not
been
a
new
man
she
would
hardly
have
risked
it
if
you
had
happened
not
to
like
painting
some
book
would
have
been
offered
you
the
return
of
a
book
naturally
brings
on
a
visit
but
all
these
devices
have
not
yet
answered
the
damsels
still
remain
like
shakspeare
plaintive
maid
single
blessedness
they
do
not
however
like
her
spend
gloomy
nights
chaunting
cold
hymns
to
the
pale
lifeless
moon
but
in
singing
sprightlier
roundelays
to
livelier
auditors
i
punctually
attended
the
invitation
effectually
shielded
from
danger
by
the
friendly
intimation
and
a
still
more
infallible
ægis
the
charge
of
my
father
never
to
embark
in
any
engagement
till
i
had
made
my
visit
to
stanley
my
veneration
for
his
memory
operated
as
a
complete
defence
i
saw
and
admired
the
pictures
the
pictures
brought
on
an
invitation
to
dinner
i
found
fentham
to
be
in
her
conversation
a
sensible
correct
knowing
woman
her
daughters
were
elegant
in
their
figures
well
instructed
in
the
usual
accomplishments
and
apparently
well
tempered
fentham
was
a
man
of
business
and
of
the
world
he
had
a
great
income
from
a
place
under
government
out
of
which
the
expenses
of
his
family
permitted
him
to
save
nothing
private
fortune
he
had
little
or
none
his
employment
engaged
him
almost
entirely
so
that
he
interfered
but
little
with
domestic
affairs
a
general
air
of
elegance
almost
amounting
to
magnificence
pervaded
the
whole
establishment
i
at
first
saw
but
little
to
excite
any
suspicion
of
the
artificial
character
of
the
lady
of
the
house
the
first
gleam
of
light
which
let
in
the
truth
was
the
expressions
most
frequent
in
mouth
what
will
the
world
say
what
will
people
think
how
will
such
a
thing
appear
will
it
have
a
good
look
the
world
is
of
opinion
wo
such
a
thing
be
censured
on
a
little
acquaintance
i
discovered
that
human
applause
was
the
motive
of
all
she
said
and
reputation
her
great
object
in
all
she
did
opinion
was
the
idol
to
which
she
sacrificed
decorum
was
the
inspirer
of
her
duties
and
praise
the
reward
of
them
the
standard
of
the
world
was
the
standard
by
which
she
weighed
actions
she
had
no
higher
principle
of
conduct
she
adopted
the
forms
of
religion
because
she
saw
that
carried
to
a
certain
degree
they
rather
produced
credit
than
censure
while
her
husband
adjusted
his
accounts
on
the
sunday
morning
she
regularly
carried
her
daughters
to
church
except
a
had
been
caught
at
the
saturday
opera
and
as
regularly
exhibited
herself
and
them
afterward
in
as
she
said
it
was
fentham
leisure
day
she
complimented
him
with
always
having
a
great
dinner
on
sundays
but
alleged
her
piety
as
a
reason
for
not
having
cards
in
the
evening
at
home
though
she
had
no
scruple
to
make
one
at
a
private
party
at
a
friend
house
soberly
conditioning
however
that
there
should
not
be
more
than
the
right
or
wrong
the
decorum
or
impropriety
the
gayety
or
gravity
always
being
made
specifically
to
depend
on
the
number
of
tables
she
was
in
general
extremely
severe
against
women
who
had
lost
their
reputation
though
she
had
no
hesitation
in
visiting
a
few
of
the
most
dishonorable
if
they
were
of
high
rank
or
belonged
to
a
certain
set
in
that
case
she
excused
herself
by
saying
that
as
fashionable
people
continued
to
countenance
them
it
was
not
for
her
to
be
scrupulous
one
must
sail
with
the
stream
i
ca
set
my
face
against
the
world
but
if
an
unhappy
girl
had
been
drawn
aside
or
one
who
had
not
rank
to
bear
her
out
had
erred
that
altered
the
case
and
she
then
expressed
the
most
virtuous
indignation
when
modesty
happened
to
be
in
repute
not
the
necks
of
queen
elizabeth
and
her
courtly
virgins
were
more
entrenched
in
ruffs
and
shrouded
in
tuckers
than
those
of
fentham
and
her
daughters
but
when
became
the
order
of
the
day
the
grecian
venus
was
scarcely
more
unconscious
of
a
vail
with
a
very
good
understanding
she
never
allowed
herself
one
original
thought
or
one
spontaneous
action
her
ideas
her
language
and
her
conduct
were
entirely
regulated
by
the
ideas
language
and
conduct
of
those
who
stood
well
in
the
world
vanity
in
her
was
a
steady
inward
but
powerfully
pervading
principle
it
did
not
evaporate
in
levity
or
indiscretion
but
was
the
hidden
though
forcible
spring
of
her
whole
course
of
action
she
had
all
the
gratification
which
vanity
affords
in
secret
and
all
the
credit
which
its
prudent
operation
procures
in
public
she
was
apparently
guilty
of
no
excess
of
any
kind
she
had
a
sober
scale
of
creditable
vices
and
never
allowed
herself
to
exceed
a
few
stated
degrees
in
any
of
them
she
reprobated
gaming
but
could
not
exist
without
cards
masquerades
she
censured
as
highly
extravagant
and
dangerous
but
when
given
by
ladies
of
high
quality
at
their
own
houses
she
thought
them
an
elegant
and
proper
amusement
though
she
sometimes
went
to
the
play
she
did
not
care
for
what
passed
on
the
stage
for
she
confessed
the
chief
pleasure
the
theatre
afforded
was
to
reckon
up
when
she
came
home
how
many
duchesses
and
countesses
had
bowed
to
her
across
the
house
a
complete
despot
at
home
her
arbitrariness
is
so
vailed
by
correctness
of
manner
and
studied
good
breeding
that
she
obtains
the
credit
of
great
mildness
and
moderation
she
is
said
not
to
love
her
daughters
who
come
too
near
her
in
age
and
go
too
much
beyond
her
in
beauty
to
be
forgiven
yet
like
a
consummate
politician
she
is
ever
laboring
for
their
advancement
she
has
generally
several
schemes
in
hand
and
always
one
scheme
under
another
the
ready
to
be
brought
forward
if
the
principal
one
fails
though
she
encourages
pretenders
yet
she
is
afraid
to
accept
of
a
tolerable
proposal
lest
a
better
should
present
itself
but
if
the
loftier
hope
fails
she
then
contrives
to
lure
back
the
inferior
offer
she
can
balance
to
a
nicety
in
the
calculation
of
chances
the
advantages
or
disadvantages
of
a
higher
possibility
against
a
lower
probability
though
she
neither
wants
reading
nor
taste
her
mind
is
never
sufficiently
disengaged
to
make
her
an
agreeable
companion
her
head
is
always
at
work
conjecturing
the
event
of
every
fresh
ball
and
every
new
acquaintance
she
can
not
even
take
her
tea
without
a
stratagem
she
set
out
in
life
with
a
very
slender
acquaintance
and
clung
for
a
while
to
one
or
two
damaged
peeresses
who
were
not
received
by
women
of
their
own
rank
but
i
am
told
it
was
curious
to
see
with
what
adroitness
she
could
extricate
herself
from
a
disreputable
acquaintance
when
a
more
honorable
one
stepped
in
to
fill
the
niche
she
made
her
way
rapidly
by
insinuating
to
one
person
of
note
how
intimate
she
was
with
another
and
to
both
what
handsome
things
each
said
of
the
other
by
constant
attentions
petty
offices
and
measured
flattery
she
has
got
footing
into
almost
every
house
of
distinction
her
decorum
is
invariable
she
boasts
that
she
was
never
guilty
of
the
indecency
of
violent
passion
poor
woman
she
fancies
there
is
no
violent
passion
but
that
of
anger
little
does
she
think
that
ambition
vanity
the
hunger
of
applause
a
rage
for
being
universally
known
are
all
violent
passion
however
modified
by
discretion
or
varnished
by
art
she
suffers
too
all
that
vexation
of
spirit
which
treads
on
the
heels
of
vanity
disappointment
and
jealousy
poison
the
days
devoted
to
pleasure
the
party
does
not
answer
the
wrong
people
never
stay
away
and
the
right
ones
never
come
the
guest
for
whom
the
fête
is
made
is
sure
to
fail
her
party
is
thin
while
that
of
her
competitor
overflows
or
there
is
a
plenty
of
dowagers
and
a
paucity
of
young
men
when
the
costly
and
elaborate
supper
is
on
the
table
excuses
arrive
even
if
the
supper
is
crowded
the
daughters
remain
upon
hands
how
strikingly
does
she
exemplify
the
strong
expression
of
laboring
in
the
fire
for
very
vanity
of
giving
her
money
for
that
which
is
not
bread
and
her
labor
for
that
which
satisfieth
not
after
spending
the
day
at
fentham
i
went
to
sup
with
my
friends
in
lady
belfield
was
impatient
for
my
history
of
the
dinner
but
sir
john
said
laughing
you
shall
not
say
a
word
charles
i
can
tell
how
it
was
as
exactly
as
if
i
had
been
there
charlotte
who
has
the
best
voice
was
brought
out
to
sing
but
was
placed
a
little
behind
as
her
person
is
not
quite
perfect
maria
who
is
the
most
picturesque
figure
was
put
at
the
harp
arrayed
in
the
costume
and
assuming
the
fascinating
graces
of
lady
heron
fair
was
her
rounded
arm
as
the
strings
her
fingers
flow
then
charles
was
the
moment
of
peril
then
according
to
your
favorite
milton
most
incongruous
image
you
took
in
sounds
that
might
create
a
soul
under
the
ribs
of
death
for
fear
however
that
your
heart
of
adamant
should
hold
out
against
all
these
perilous
assaults
its
vulnerability
was
tried
in
other
quarters
the
titian
would
naturally
lead
to
livinia
drawings
a
beautiful
sketch
of
the
lakes
would
be
produced
with
a
gentle
intimation
what
a
sweet
place
westmoreland
must
be
to
live
in
when
you
had
exhausted
all
proper
raptures
on
the
art
and
on
the
artist
it
would
be
recollected
that
as
westmoreland
was
so
near
scotland
you
would
naturally
be
fond
of
a
reel
the
reel
of
course
succeeded
then
putting
himself
into
an
attitude
and
speaking
theatrically
he
continued
then
universal
pan
knit
with
the
graces
and
the
hours
in
dance
oh
no
i
forgot
universal
pan
could
not
join
but
he
could
admire
then
all
the
perfections
of
all
the
nymphs
burst
on
you
in
full
blaze
such
a
concentration
of
attractions
you
never
could
resist
you
are
a
man
and
now
doubtless
a
lost
man
here
he
stopped
to
finish
his
laugh
and
i
was
driven
reluctantly
to
acknowledge
that
his
picture
though
a
caricature
was
notwithstanding
a
resemblance
and
so
said
sir
john
you
were
brought
under
no
power
of
incantation
by
this
dangerous
visit
you
will
not
be
driven
like
the
tempted
ithacan
to
tie
yourself
to
a
mast
or
to
flee
for
safety
from
the
enchantment
of
these
sirens
while
we
were
at
supper
with
more
gravity
he
said
among
the
various
objects
of
ambition
there
are
few
in
life
which
bring
less
accession
to
its
comfort
than
an
unceasing
struggle
to
rise
to
an
elevation
in
society
very
much
above
the
level
of
our
own
condition
without
being
aided
by
any
stronger
ascending
power
than
mere
vanity
great
talents
of
whatever
kind
have
a
natural
tendency
to
rise
and
to
lift
their
possessor
the
flame
in
mounting
does
but
obey
its
impulse
but
when
there
is
no
energy
more
powerful
than
the
passion
to
be
great
destitute
of
the
gifts
which
confer
greatness
the
painful
efforts
of
ambition
are
like
water
forced
above
its
level
by
mechanical
powers
it
requires
constant
exertions
of
art
to
keep
up
what
art
first
set
poor
fentham
head
is
perpetually
at
work
to
maintain
the
elevation
she
has
reached
and
how
little
after
all
is
she
considered
by
those
on
whose
caresses
her
happiness
depends
she
has
lost
the
esteem
of
her
original
circle
where
she
might
have
been
respected
without
gaining
that
of
her
high
associates
who
though
they
receive
her
still
refuse
her
claims
of
equality
she
is
not
considered
as
of
their
it
is
but
at
best
at
fentham
i
encountered
lady
bab
lawless
a
renowned
modish
dowager
famous
for
laying
siege
to
the
heart
of
every
distinguished
man
with
the
united
artillery
of
her
own
wit
and
her
daughters
beauty
how
many
ways
there
are
of
being
wrong
she
was
of
a
character
diametrically
opposite
to
that
of
fentham
she
had
the
same
end
in
view
but
the
means
she
used
to
accomplish
it
were
of
a
bolder
strain
lady
bab
affected
no
delicacy
she
laughed
at
reserve
she
had
shaken
hands
with
decorum
she
held
the
tenor
of
her
way
with
no
assumed
refinement
and
so
far
from
shielding
her
designs
behind
the
mask
of
decency
she
disdained
the
obsolete
expedient
her
plans
succeeded
the
more
infallibly
because
her
frankness
defeated
all
suspicion
a
man
could
never
divine
that
such
gay
and
open
assaults
could
have
their
foundation
in
design
and
he
gave
her
full
credit
for
artless
simplicity
at
the
moment
she
was
catching
him
in
her
toils
if
she
now
and
then
had
gone
too
far
and
by
a
momentary
oversight
or
excessive
levity
had
betrayed
too
much
with
infinite
address
she
would
make
a
turn
and
fall
to
discussing
not
without
ability
some
moral
or
theological
topic
thus
she
affected
to
establish
the
character
of
a
woman
thoughtless
through
wit
indiscreet
through
simplicity
but
religious
on
principle
as
there
is
no
part
of
the
appendage
to
a
wife
which
i
have
ever
more
dreaded
than
a
machiavelian
mother
i
should
have
been
deaf
to
wit
and
blind
to
beauty
and
dead
to
advances
had
their
united
batteries
been
directed
against
me
but
i
had
not
the
ambition
to
aspire
to
that
honor
i
was
much
too
low
a
mark
for
her
lofty
aim
she
had
a
natural
antipathy
to
every
name
that
could
not
be
found
in
the
red
book
she
equally
shrunk
from
untitled
opulence
and
indigent
nobility
she
knew
by
instinct
if
a
younger
son
was
in
the
room
and
by
a
petrifying
look
checked
his
most
distant
approaches
while
with
her
powerful
spells
she
never
failed
to
draw
within
her
magic
circle
the
splendid
heir
and
charm
him
to
her
purpose
highly
born
herself
she
had
early
been
married
to
a
rich
man
of
inferior
rank
for
the
sake
of
a
large
settlement
her
plan
was
that
her
daughters
who
by
the
way
are
modest
and
estimable
should
find
in
the
man
they
married
still
higher
birth
than
her
own
and
more
riches
than
her
husband
it
was
a
curious
speculation
to
compare
these
two
friends
and
to
observe
how
much
less
the
refined
maneuvers
of
fentham
answered
than
the
open
assaults
of
the
intrepid
lady
bab
all
the
intricacies
and
labyrinths
which
the
former
has
been
so
skillful
and
so
patient
in
weaving
have
not
yet
enthralled
one
captive
while
the
composed
effrontery
the
affecting
to
take
for
granted
the
offer
which
was
never
meant
to
be
made
and
treating
that
as
concluded
which
was
never
so
much
as
intended
drew
the
unconscious
victim
of
the
other
into
the
trap
before
he
knew
it
was
set
the
depth
of
her
plot
consisting
in
not
appearing
to
have
any
it
was
a
novelty
in
intrigue
an
originality
which
defied
all
competition
and
in
which
no
imitator
had
any
chance
of
success
chapter
x
sir
john
carried
me
one
morning
to
call
on
lady
denham
a
dowager
of
fashion
who
had
grown
old
in
the
trammels
of
the
world
though
she
seems
resolved
to
die
in
the
harness
yet
she
piques
herself
on
being
very
religious
and
no
one
inveighs
against
infidelity
or
impiety
with
more
pointed
censure
she
has
a
said
sir
john
who
lives
with
her
and
whom
she
has
trained
to
walk
precisely
in
her
own
steps
and
which
she
thinks
the
way
she
should
the
girl
added
he
smiling
is
well
looking
and
will
have
a
handsome
fortune
and
i
am
persuaded
that
as
a
friend
i
could
procure
you
a
good
reception
we
were
shown
into
her
where
we
found
her
with
a
book
lying
open
before
her
from
a
glance
which
i
caught
of
the
large
black
letter
i
saw
it
was
a
this
book
it
seems
constantly
lay
open
before
her
from
breakfast
to
dinner
at
this
season
it
was
passion
week
but
as
this
is
the
room
in
which
he
sees
all
her
morning
visitors
to
none
of
whom
is
she
ever
denied
even
at
this
period
of
retreat
she
could
only
pick
up
momentary
snatches
of
reading
in
the
short
intervals
between
one
person
bowing
out
and
another
courtesying
in
miss
denham
sat
by
painting
flowers
sir
john
asked
her
ladyship
if
she
would
go
and
dine
in
a
family
way
with
lady
belfield
she
drew
up
looked
grave
and
said
with
much
solemnity
that
she
should
never
think
of
dining
abroad
at
this
holy
season
sir
john
said
as
we
have
neither
cards
nor
company
i
thought
you
might
as
well
have
eaten
your
chicken
in
my
house
as
in
your
own
but
though
she
thought
it
a
sin
to
dine
with
a
sober
family
she
made
herself
amends
for
the
sacrifice
by
letting
us
see
that
her
heart
was
brimful
of
the
world
pressed
down
and
running
over
she
indemnified
herself
for
her
abstinence
from
its
diversions
by
indulging
in
the
only
pleasures
which
she
thought
compatible
with
the
sanctity
of
the
season
uncharitable
gossip
and
unbounded
calumny
she
would
not
touch
a
card
for
the
world
but
she
played
over
to
sir
john
the
whole
game
of
the
preceding
saturday
night
told
him
by
what
a
shameful
inattention
her
partner
had
lost
the
odd
trick
and
that
she
should
not
have
been
beaten
after
all
had
not
her
adversary
she
verily
believed
contrived
to
look
over
her
hand
sir
john
seized
the
only
minute
in
which
we
were
alone
to
ask
her
to
add
a
guinea
to
a
little
sum
he
was
collecting
for
a
poor
tradesman
with
a
large
family
who
had
been
burned
out
a
few
nights
ago
his
wife
added
he
was
your
favorite
maid
dixon
and
both
are
deserving
people
ah
poor
dixon
she
was
always
unlucky
replied
the
lady
how
could
they
be
so
careless
surely
they
might
have
put
the
fire
out
sooner
they
should
not
have
let
it
get
ahead
i
wonder
people
are
not
more
active
it
is
too
late
to
inquire
about
that
said
sir
john
the
question
now
is
not
how
their
loss
might
have
been
prevented
but
how
it
may
be
repaired
i
am
really
quite
sorry
said
she
that
i
can
give
you
nothing
i
have
had
so
many
calls
lately
that
my
charity
purse
is
completely
exhausted
and
that
abominable
makes
me
quite
a
beggar
while
she
was
speaking
i
glanced
at
the
open
leaf
at
charge
them
that
are
rich
in
this
world
that
they
be
ready
to
give
and
directing
my
eye
further
it
fell
on
be
not
deceived
god
is
not
mocked
these
were
the
awful
passages
which
formed
a
part
of
her
and
this
was
the
practical
use
she
made
of
them
a
dozen
persons
of
both
sexes
had
their
exits
and
their
entrances
during
our
stay
for
the
scene
was
so
strange
and
the
character
so
new
to
me
that
i
felt
unwilling
to
stir
among
other
visitors
was
signor
squallini
a
favorite
opera
singer
whom
she
patronized
her
face
was
lighted
up
with
joy
at
the
sight
of
him
he
brought
her
an
admired
new
air
in
which
he
was
preparing
himself
and
sung
a
few
notes
that
she
might
say
she
had
heard
it
the
first
she
felt
all
the
dignity
of
the
privilege
and
extolled
the
air
with
all
the
phrases
cant
and
rapture
of
after
this
she
drew
a
paper
from
between
the
leaves
of
her
still
open
book
which
she
showed
him
it
contained
a
list
of
all
the
company
she
had
engaged
to
attend
his
benefit
i
will
call
on
some
others
said
she
after
prayers
i
am
sorry
this
is
a
week
in
which
i
can
not
see
my
friends
at
their
assemblies
but
on
sunday
you
know
it
will
be
over
and
i
shall
have
my
house
full
in
the
evening
next
monday
will
be
easter
and
i
shall
be
at
our
dear
duchess
private
masquerade
and
then
i
hope
to
see
and
engage
the
whole
world
here
are
ten
guineas
said
she
in
a
half
whisper
to
the
obsequious
signor
you
may
mention
what
i
gave
for
ticket
and
it
may
set
the
fashion
going
she
then
pressed
a
ticket
on
sir
john
and
another
on
me
ho
declined
saying
with
great
you
know
we
are
what
excuse
i
made
i
do
not
well
know
i
only
know
that
i
saved
my
ten
guineas
with
a
very
bad
grace
but
felt
bound
in
conscience
to
add
them
to
what
i
had
before
subscribed
to
poor
dixon
hitherto
i
had
never
seen
the
and
the
so
strikingly
exemplified
and
it
is
observable
how
forcibly
the
truth
of
scripture
is
often
illustrated
by
those
who
live
in
the
boldest
opposition
to
it
if
you
have
any
doubt
while
you
are
reading
go
into
the
world
and
your
belief
will
be
confirmed
as
we
took
our
leave
she
followed
us
to
the
door
i
hoped
it
was
with
the
guinea
for
the
fire
but
she
only
whispered
sir
john
though
he
did
not
go
himself
to
prevail
on
such
and
such
ladies
to
go
to
benefit
pray
do
said
she
it
will
be
charity
poor
fellow
he
is
sadly
out
at
elbows
he
has
a
fine
liberal
spirit
and
can
hardly
make
his
large
income
do
when
we
got
into
the
street
we
admired
the
splendid
chariot
and
laced
liveries
of
this
professor
for
whom
our
charity
had
been
just
solicited
and
whose
liberal
spirit
my
friend
assured
me
consisted
in
sumptuous
living
and
the
indulgence
of
every
fashionable
vice
i
could
not
restrain
my
exclamations
as
soon
as
we
got
out
of
hearing
to
sir
john
the
scene
was
amusing
but
to
him
it
had
lost
the
interest
of
novelty
i
have
known
her
ladyship
about
twelve
years
said
he
and
of
course
have
witnessed
a
dozen
of
these
annual
paroxysms
of
devotion
i
am
persuaded
that
she
is
a
gainer
by
them
on
her
own
principle
that
is
in
the
article
of
pleasure
this
short
periodical
abstinence
whets
her
appetite
to
a
keener
relish
for
suspended
enjoyment
and
while
she
fasts
from
amusements
her
blinded
conscience
enjoys
a
feast
of
she
feeds
on
the
remembrance
of
her
even
after
she
has
returned
to
those
delights
which
she
thinks
her
retreat
has
fairly
purchased
she
considers
religion
as
a
system
of
pains
and
penalties
by
the
voluntary
enduring
of
which
for
a
short
time
she
shall
compound
for
all
the
indulgences
of
the
year
she
is
persuaded
that
something
must
be
annually
forborne
in
order
to
make
her
peace
after
these
periodical
atonements
the
almighty
being
in
her
debt
will
be
obliged
at
last
to
pay
her
with
heaven
this
composition
which
rather
brings
her
in
on
the
creditor
side
not
only
quiets
her
conscience
for
the
past
but
enables
her
joyfully
to
enter
on
a
new
score
i
asked
sir
john
how
lady
belfield
associate
with
a
woman
of
a
character
so
opposite
to
her
own
what
can
we
do
said
he
we
can
not
be
singular
we
must
conform
a
to
the
world
in
which
we
live
trusting
to
his
extreme
good
nature
and
fired
at
the
scene
to
which
i
had
been
a
witness
i
ventured
to
observe
that
to
such
a
world
as
that
of
which
this
lady
was
a
specimen
was
the
very
criterion
of
the
religion
taught
by
him
who
had
declared
by
way
of
distinction
that
his
kingdom
was
not
of
this
world
you
are
a
young
man
answered
he
mildly
and
this
delicacy
and
these
prejudices
would
soon
wear
off
if
you
were
to
live
some
time
in
the
world
my
dear
sir
john
said
i
warmly
by
the
grace
of
god
i
never
live
in
the
world
at
least
i
never
will
associate
with
that
part
of
it
whose
society
would
be
sure
to
wear
off
that
delicacy
and
remove
those
prejudices
why
this
is
retaining
all
the
worst
part
of
popery
here
is
the
abstinence
without
the
devotion
the
outward
observance
without
the
interior
humiliation
the
suspending
of
sin
not
only
without
any
design
of
forsaking
it
but
with
a
fixed
resolution
of
returning
to
it
and
of
increasing
the
gust
by
the
forbearance
nay
the
sins
she
retains
in
order
to
mitigate
the
horrors
of
forbearance
are
as
bad
as
those
she
lays
down
a
postponed
sin
which
is
fully
intended
to
be
resumed
is
as
much
worse
than
a
sin
persisted
in
as
deliberate
hypocrisy
is
worse
than
the
impulse
of
passion
i
desire
not
a
more
explicit
comment
on
a
text
which
i
was
once
almost
tempted
to
think
unjust
i
mean
the
greater
facility
of
the
entrance
of
gross
and
notorious
offenders
into
heaven
than
of
these
formalists
no
if
miss
denham
were
sole
heiress
to
cr
oe
sus
and
joined
the
beauty
of
cleopatra
to
the
wit
of
sappho
i
never
would
connect
myself
with
a
disciple
of
that
school
how
many
ways
there
are
of
being
unhappy
said
sir
john
as
we
returned
one
day
from
a
ride
we
had
taken
some
miles
out
of
town
to
call
on
a
friend
of
his
stanhope
whom
we
have
just
quitted
is
a
man
of
great
elegance
of
mind
his
early
life
was
passed
in
liberal
studies
and
in
the
best
company
but
his
fair
prospects
were
blasted
by
a
disproportionate
marriage
he
was
drawn
in
by
a
vanity
too
natural
to
young
men
that
of
fancying
himself
preferred
by
a
woman
who
had
no
one
recommendation
but
beauty
to
be
admired
by
her
whom
all
his
acquaintance
admired
gratified
his
he
was
overcome
by
her
marked
attentions
so
far
as
to
declare
himself
without
knowing
her
real
disposition
it
was
some
time
before
his
prepossession
allowed
him
to
discover
that
she
was
weak
and
selfish
and
what
she
wanted
in
understanding
she
made
up
in
spirit
the
more
she
exacted
the
more
he
submitted
and
her
demands
grew
in
proportion
to
his
sacrifices
my
friend
with
patient
affection
struggled
for
a
long
time
to
raise
her
character
and
to
enlighten
her
mind
but
finding
that
she
pouted
whenever
he
took
up
a
book
and
that
she
even
hid
the
newspaper
before
he
had
read
it
complaining
that
he
preferred
any
thing
to
her
company
the
softness
of
his
temper
and
his
habitual
indolence
at
length
prevailed
his
better
judgment
sunk
in
the
hopeless
contest
for
a
quiet
life
he
has
submitted
to
a
disgraceful
life
the
compromise
has
not
answered
he
has
incurred
the
degradation
which
by
a
more
spirited
conduct
he
might
have
avoided
and
has
missed
the
quiet
which
he
sacrificed
his
dignity
to
purchase
he
compassionates
her
folly
and
continues
to
translate
her
wearisome
interruptions
into
the
flattering
language
of
affection
in
compliment
to
her
no
less
than
in
justification
of
his
own
choice
he
has
persuaded
himself
that
all
women
are
pretty
much
alike
that
in
point
of
capacity
disposition
and
knowledge
he
has
but
drawn
the
common
lot
with
the
balance
in
his
favor
of
strong
affection
and
unsullied
virtue
he
hardly
ever
sees
his
fine
library
which
is
the
object
of
her
supreme
aversion
but
wastes
his
days
in
listless
idleness
and
his
evenings
at
cards
the
only
thing
in
which
she
takes
a
lively
interest
his
fine
mind
is
i
fear
growing
mean
and
disingenuous
the
gentleness
of
his
temper
leads
him
not
only
to
sacrifice
his
peace
but
to
infringe
on
his
veracity
in
order
to
keep
her
quiet
all
the
entertainment
he
finds
at
dinner
is
a
recapitulation
of
the
faults
of
her
maids
or
the
impertinence
of
her
footmen
or
the
negligence
of
her
gardener
if
to
please
her
he
joins
in
the
censure
she
turns
suddenly
about
and
defends
them
if
he
vindicates
them
she
insists
on
their
immediate
dismission
and
no
sooner
are
they
irrevocably
discharged
than
she
is
continually
dwelling
on
their
perfections
and
then
it
is
only
their
successors
who
have
any
faults
he
is
now
so
afraid
of
her
driving
out
his
few
remaining
old
servants
if
she
sees
his
partiality
for
them
that
in
order
to
conceal
it
he
affects
to
reprimand
them
as
the
only
means
for
them
to
secure
her
favor
thus
the
integrity
of
his
heart
is
giving
way
to
a
petty
duplicity
and
the
openness
of
his
temper
to
shabby
artifices
he
could
submit
to
the
loss
of
his
comfort
but
sensibly
feels
the
diminution
of
his
credit
the
loss
of
his
usefulness
too
is
a
constant
source
of
regret
she
will
not
even
suffer
him
to
act
as
a
magistrate
lest
her
doors
should
be
beset
with
vagabonds
and
her
house
dirtied
by
men
of
business
if
he
chance
to
commend
a
dish
he
has
tasted
at
a
house
yes
every
body
things
are
good
but
hers
she
can
never
please
he
had
always
better
dine
abroad
if
nothing
is
fit
to
be
eaten
at
home
though
poor
stanhope
conduct
is
so
correct
and
his
attachment
to
his
wife
so
notorious
he
never
ventures
to
commend
any
thing
that
is
said
or
done
by
another
woman
she
has
indeed
no
definitive
object
of
jealousy
but
feels
an
uneasy
vague
sensation
of
envy
at
any
thing
or
person
he
admires
i
believe
she
would
be
jealous
of
a
fine
day
if
her
husband
praised
it
if
a
tale
reaches
her
ears
of
a
wife
who
has
failed
of
her
duty
or
if
the
public
newspapers
record
a
divorce
then
she
awakens
her
husband
to
a
sense
of
his
superior
happiness
and
her
own
irreproachable
virtue
o
charles
the
woman
who
reposing
on
the
laurels
of
her
boasted
virtue
allows
herself
to
be
a
disobliging
a
peevish
a
gloomy
a
discontented
companion
defeats
one
great
end
of
the
institution
which
is
happiness
the
wife
who
violates
the
marriage
vow
is
indeed
more
criminal
but
the
very
magnitude
of
her
crime
emancipates
her
husband
while
she
who
makes
him
not
dishonorable
but
wretched
fastens
on
him
a
misery
for
life
from
which
no
laws
can
free
him
and
under
which
religion
alone
can
support
him
we
continued
talking
till
we
reached
home
on
the
multitude
of
marriages
in
which
the
parties
are
joined
not
matched
and
where
the
term
union
is
a
miserable
misnomer
i
endeavored
to
turn
all
these
new
acquaintances
to
account
and
considered
myself
at
every
visit
i
made
as
taking
a
lesson
for
my
own
conduct
i
beheld
the
miscarriages
of
others
not
only
with
concern
for
the
individual
but
as
beacons
to
light
me
on
my
way
it
was
no
breach
of
charity
to
use
the
aberrations
of
my
acquaintance
for
the
purpose
of
making
my
own
course
more
direct
i
took
care
however
never
to
lose
sight
of
the
humbling
consideration
that
my
own
deviations
were
equally
liable
to
become
the
object
of
their
animadversion
if
the
same
motive
had
led
them
to
the
same
scrutiny
i
remained
some
weeks
longer
in
town
indulging
myself
in
all
its
safe
sights
and
all
its
sober
pleasures
i
examined
whatever
was
new
in
art
or
curious
in
science
i
found
out
the
best
pictures
saw
the
best
statues
explored
the
best
museums
heard
the
best
speakers
in
the
courts
of
law
the
best
preachers
in
the
church
and
the
best
orators
in
parliament
attended
the
best
lectures
and
visited
the
best
company
in
the
most
correct
though
not
always
the
most
fashionable
sense
of
the
term
i
associated
with
many
learned
sensible
and
some
pious
men
commodities
with
which
london
with
all
its
faults
abounds
perhaps
more
than
any
other
place
on
the
habitable
globe
i
became
acquainted
with
many
agreeable
well
informed
valuable
women
with
a
few
who
even
seemed
in
a
good
measure
to
live
above
the
world
while
they
were
living
in
it
there
is
a
large
class
of
excellent
female
characters
who
on
account
of
that
very
excellence
are
little
known
because
to
be
known
is
not
their
object
their
ambition
has
a
better
taste
they
pass
through
life
honored
and
respected
in
their
own
small
but
not
unimportant
sphere
and
approved
by
him
whose
they
are
and
whom
they
serve
though
their
faces
are
hardly
known
in
promiscuous
society
if
they
occasion
little
sensation
abroad
they
produce
much
happiness
at
home
and
when
once
a
woman
who
has
all
appliances
and
means
to
get
it
withstand
the
intoxication
of
the
flatterer
and
the
adoration
of
the
fashionable
conquer
the
fondness
for
public
distinction
resist
the
temptations
of
that
magic
circle
to
which
she
is
courted
and
in
which
she
is
qualified
to
shine
this
is
indeed
a
trial
of
firmness
a
trial
in
which
those
who
have
never
been
called
to
resist
themselves
can
hardly
judge
of
the
merit
of
resistance
in
others
these
are
the
women
who
bless
dignify
and
truly
adorn
society
the
painter
indeed
does
not
make
his
fortune
by
their
sitting
to
him
the
jeweler
is
neither
brought
into
vogue
by
furnishing
their
diamonds
nor
undone
by
not
being
paid
for
them
the
prosperity
of
the
milliner
does
not
depend
on
affixing
their
name
to
a
cap
or
a
color
the
poet
does
not
celebrate
them
the
novelist
does
not
dedicate
to
them
but
they
possess
the
affection
of
their
husbands
the
attachment
of
their
children
the
esteem
of
the
wise
and
good
and
above
all
they
possess
favor
whom
to
know
is
life
eternal
among
these
i
doubt
not
i
might
have
found
objects
highly
deserving
of
my
heart
but
the
injunction
of
my
father
was
a
sort
of
panoply
which
guarded
it
i
am
persuaded
that
such
women
compose
a
larger
portion
of
the
sex
than
is
generally
allowed
it
is
not
the
number
but
the
noise
which
makes
a
sensation
and
a
set
of
fair
dependent
young
creatures
who
are
every
night
forced
some
of
them
reluctantly
upon
the
public
eye
and
a
bevy
of
faded
matrons
rouged
and
repaired
for
an
ungrateful
public
dead
to
their
blandishments
do
not
compose
the
whole
female
world
i
repeat
it
a
hundred
amiable
women
who
are
living
in
the
quiet
practice
of
their
duties
and
the
modest
exertion
of
their
talents
do
not
fill
the
public
eye
or
reach
the
public
ear
like
one
aspiring
leader
who
hungering
for
observation
and
disdaining
censure
dreads
not
abuse
but
oblivion
who
thinks
it
more
glorious
to
head
a
little
phalanx
of
fashionable
followers
than
to
hold
out
as
from
her
commanding
eminence
and
imposing
talents
she
might
have
done
a
shining
example
of
all
that
is
great
and
good
and
dignified
in
woman
these
queens
maintain
an
absolute
but
ephemeral
empire
over
that
little
which
they
call
the
world
admiration
besets
them
crowds
attend
them
conquests
follow
them
inferiors
imitate
them
rivals
envy
them
newspapers
extol
them
sonnets
deify
them
a
few
ostentatious
charities
are
opposed
as
a
large
atonement
for
a
amiable
while
the
unpaid
tradesman
is
exposed
to
ruin
by
their
vengeance
if
he
refuses
to
trust
them
and
to
a
jail
if
he
continue
to
do
it
chapter
xi
the
three
days
previous
to
my
leaving
london
were
passed
with
sir
john
and
lady
belfield
knowing
i
was
on
the
wing
for
hampshire
they
promised
to
make
their
long
intended
visit
to
stanley
grove
during
my
stay
there
on
the
first
of
these
days
we
were
agreeably
surprised
at
the
appearance
of
barlow
an
old
friend
of
sir
john
and
the
excellent
rector
of
stanley
parish
being
obliged
to
come
to
town
on
urgent
business
for
a
couple
of
days
he
was
charged
to
assure
me
of
the
cordial
welcome
which
awaited
me
at
the
grove
i
was
glad
to
make
this
early
acquaintance
with
this
highly
respectable
divine
i
made
a
thousand
inquiries
about
his
neighbors
and
expressed
my
impatience
to
know
more
of
a
family
in
whose
characters
i
already
felt
a
more
than
common
interest
sir
said
he
if
you
set
me
talking
of
stanley
you
must
abide
by
the
consequences
of
your
indiscretion
and
bear
with
the
loquacity
of
which
that
subject
never
fails
to
make
me
guilty
he
is
a
greater
blessing
to
me
as
a
friend
and
to
my
parish
as
an
example
and
a
benefactor
than
i
can
describe
i
assured
him
that
he
could
not
be
too
minute
in
speaking
of
a
man
whom
i
had
been
early
taught
to
admire
by
that
exact
judge
of
merit
my
late
father
stanley
said
the
worthy
doctor
is
about
his
admirable
wife
is
about
six
or
seven
years
younger
he
passed
the
early
part
of
his
life
in
london
in
the
best
society
his
commerce
with
the
world
was
to
a
mind
like
his
all
pure
gain
for
he
brought
away
from
it
all
the
good
it
had
to
give
without
exchanging
for
it
one
particle
of
his
own
integrity
he
acquired
the
air
manners
and
sentiments
of
a
gentleman
without
any
sacrifice
of
his
sincerity
indeed
he
may
be
said
to
have
turned
his
knowledge
of
the
world
to
a
religious
account
for
it
has
enabled
him
to
recommend
religion
to
those
who
do
not
like
it
well
enough
to
forgive
for
its
sake
the
least
awkwardness
of
gesture
or
inelegance
of
manner
when
i
became
acquainted
with
the
family
continued
he
i
told
stanley
that
i
was
afraid
her
husband
hurt
religion
in
one
sense
as
much
as
he
recommended
it
in
another
for
that
some
men
who
would
forgive
him
his
piety
for
the
sake
of
his
agreeableness
would
be
led
to
dislike
religion
more
than
ever
in
other
men
in
whom
the
jewel
was
not
so
well
set
should
like
your
religious
men
well
enough
will
they
say
they
all
resembled
stanley
whereas
the
truth
is
they
do
not
so
much
stanley
religion
as
with
it
for
the
pleasure
which
his
other
qualities
afford
them
she
assured
me
that
this
was
not
altogether
the
case
for
that
his
other
qualities
having
pioneered
his
way
and
hewed
down
the
prejudices
which
the
reputation
of
piety
naturally
raises
his
endeavors
to
be
useful
to
them
were
much
facilitated
and
he
not
only
kept
the
ground
he
had
gained
but
was
often
able
to
turn
this
influence
over
his
friends
to
a
better
account
than
they
had
intended
he
converted
their
admiration
of
him
into
arms
against
their
own
errors
he
possesses
in
perfection
continued
barlow
that
sure
criterion
of
abilities
a
great
power
over
the
minds
of
his
acquaintance
and
has
in
a
high
degree
that
rare
talent
the
art
of
conciliation
without
the
aid
of
flattery
i
have
seen
more
men
brought
over
to
his
opinion
by
a
management
derived
from
his
knowledge
of
mankind
and
by
a
principle
which
forbade
his
ever
using
this
knowledge
but
for
good
purposes
than
i
ever
observed
in
any
other
instance
and
this
without
the
slightest
deviation
from
his
scrupulous
probity
he
is
master
of
one
great
advantage
in
conversation
that
of
not
only
knowing
to
say
that
may
be
useful
but
exactly
to
say
it
in
knowing
when
to
press
a
point
and
when
to
forbear
in
his
sparing
the
of
a
vain
man
whom
he
wishes
to
reclaim
by
contriving
to
make
him
feel
himself
wrong
without
making
him
appear
ridiculous
the
former
he
knows
is
easily
pardoned
the
latter
never
he
has
studied
the
human
heart
long
enough
to
know
that
to
wound
pride
is
not
the
way
to
cure
but
to
inflame
it
and
that
exasperating
will
never
subdue
it
he
seldom
i
believe
goes
into
company
without
an
earnest
desire
to
be
useful
to
some
one
in
it
but
if
circumstances
are
adverse
if
the
tempora
does
not
present
itself
he
knows
he
should
lose
more
than
they
would
gain
by
trying
to
make
the
occasion
when
he
does
not
find
it
and
i
have
often
heard
him
say
that
when
he
can
not
benefit
others
or
be
benefited
by
them
he
endeavors
to
benefit
himself
by
the
disappointment
which
does
his
own
mind
as
much
good
by
humbling
him
with
the
sense
of
his
own
uselessness
as
the
subject
he
wished
to
have
introduced
might
have
done
them
the
death
of
his
only
son
about
six
years
ago
who
had
just
entered
his
eighth
year
is
the
only
interruption
his
family
has
had
to
a
felicity
so
unbroken
that
i
told
stanley
some
such
calamity
was
necessary
to
convince
him
that
he
was
not
to
be
put
off
with
so
poor
a
portion
as
this
world
has
to
give
i
added
that
i
should
have
been
tempted
to
doubt
his
being
in
the
favor
of
god
if
he
had
totally
escaped
chastisement
a
circumstance
which
to
many
parents
would
have
greatly
aggravated
the
blow
rather
lightened
it
to
him
the
boy
had
he
lived
to
be
of
age
was
to
have
had
a
large
independent
fortune
from
a
distant
relation
which
will
now
go
to
a
remote
branch
unless
there
should
be
another
son
wealth
said
he
to
me
have
proved
the
boy
snare
and
this
independence
his
destruction
he
who
does
all
things
well
has
afflicted
the
parents
but
he
has
saved
the
child
the
loss
of
an
only
son
however
sat
heavy
on
his
heart
but
it
was
the
means
of
enabling
him
to
glorify
god
by
his
submission
i
should
rather
say
by
his
acquiescence
submission
is
only
yielding
to
what
we
can
not
help
acquiescence
is
a
more
sublime
kind
of
resignation
it
is
a
conviction
that
the
divine
will
is
holy
just
and
good
he
once
said
to
me
were
too
fond
of
the
mercy
but
not
sufficiently
grateful
for
it
we
loved
him
so
passionately
that
we
might
have
forgotten
who
bestowed
him
to
preserve
us
from
this
temptation
god
in
great
mercy
withdrew
him
let
us
turn
our
eyes
from
the
one
blessing
we
have
lost
to
the
countless
mercies
which
are
continued
to
us
and
especially
to
the
hand
which
confers
them
to
the
hand
which
if
we
continue
to
murmur
may
strip
us
of
our
remaining
blessings
i
can
not
continued
barlow
make
a
higher
eulogium
of
stanley
than
to
say
that
she
is
every
way
worthy
of
the
husband
whose
happiness
she
makes
they
have
a
large
family
of
lovely
daughters
of
all
ages
lucilla
the
eldest
is
near
nineteen
you
would
think
me
too
poetical
were
i
to
say
she
adorns
every
virtue
with
every
grace
and
yet
i
should
only
speak
the
simple
truth
ph
oe
be
who
is
just
turned
fifteen
has
not
less
vivacity
and
sweetness
than
her
sister
but
from
her
extreme
naïveté
and
warmheartedness
she
has
somewhat
less
discretion
and
her
father
says
that
her
education
has
afforded
him
not
less
pleasure
but
more
trouble
for
the
branches
shot
so
fast
as
to
call
for
more
pruning
before
i
had
time
to
thank
the
good
doctor
for
his
interesting
little
narrative
a
loud
rap
announced
company
it
was
lady
bab
lawless
with
her
usual
versatility
she
plunged
at
once
into
every
subject
with
every
body
she
talked
to
lady
belfield
of
the
news
and
her
nursery
of
poetry
with
sir
john
of
politics
with
me
and
religion
with
barlow
she
talked
well
upon
most
of
these
points
and
not
ill
upon
any
of
them
for
she
had
the
talent
of
embellishing
subjects
of
which
she
knew
but
little
and
a
kind
of
conjectural
sagacity
and
rash
dexterity
which
prevented
her
from
appearing
ignorant
even
when
she
knew
nothing
she
thought
that
a
full
confidence
in
her
own
powers
was
the
sure
way
to
raise
them
in
the
estimation
of
others
and
it
generally
succeeded
turning
suddenly
to
lady
belfield
she
said
pray
my
dear
look
at
my
flowers
they
are
beautiful
roses
indeed
said
lady
belfield
and
as
exquisitely
exact
as
if
they
were
artificial
which
in
truth
they
are
replied
lady
bab
your
mistake
is
a
high
compliment
to
them
but
not
higher
than
they
deserve
look
especially
at
these
roses
in
my
cap
you
positively
shall
go
and
get
some
at
the
same
place
indeed
said
lady
belfield
i
am
thinking
of
laying
aside
flowers
though
my
children
are
hardly
old
enough
to
take
them
what
affectation
replied
lady
bab
why
you
are
not
above
two
or
three
and
thirty
i
am
almost
as
old
again
and
yet
i
do
think
of
giving
up
flowers
to
my
children
or
my
grandchildren
who
will
be
soon
wanting
them
indeed
i
only
now
wear
roses
i
discovered
by
this
that
white
roses
made
the
same
approximation
to
sobriety
in
dress
that
three
tables
made
to
it
in
cards
seriously
though
continued
lady
bab
you
must
and
shall
go
and
buy
some
of
fanny
flowers
i
need
only
tell
you
it
will
be
the
greatest
charity
you
ever
did
and
then
i
know
you
wo
rest
till
you
have
been
a
beautiful
girl
maintains
her
dying
mother
by
making
and
selling
flowers
here
is
her
direction
throwing
a
card
on
the
table
oh
no
this
is
not
it
i
have
forgot
the
name
but
it
is
within
two
doors
of
your
in
what
d
call
the
lane
just
out
of
it
is
a
poor
miserable
hole
but
her
roses
are
as
bright
as
if
they
grew
in
the
gardens
of
armida
she
now
rung
the
bell
violently
saying
she
had
overstaid
her
time
though
she
had
not
been
in
the
house
ten
minutes
next
morning
i
attended
lady
belfield
to
the
exhibition
in
driving
home
through
one
of
the
narrow
passages
near
i
observed
that
we
were
in
the
street
where
the
poor
lived
lady
belfield
directed
her
footman
to
inquire
for
the
house
we
went
into
it
and
in
a
small
but
clean
room
up
three
pair
of
stairs
we
found
a
very
pretty
and
very
genteel
young
girl
at
work
on
her
gay
manufacture
the
young
woman
presented
her
elegant
performances
with
an
air
of
uncommon
grace
and
modesty
she
was
the
more
interesting
because
the
delicacy
of
her
appearance
seemed
to
proceed
from
ill
health
and
a
tear
stood
in
her
eye
while
she
exhibited
her
works
you
do
not
seem
well
my
dear
said
lady
belfield
with
a
kindness
which
was
natural
to
her
i
never
care
about
my
own
health
madam
replied
she
but
i
fear
my
dear
mother
is
dying
she
stopped
and
the
tears
which
she
had
endeavored
to
restrain
now
flowed
plentifully
down
her
cheeks
where
is
your
mother
child
said
lady
belfield
in
the
next
room
madam
let
us
see
her
said
her
ladyship
if
it
wo
too
much
disturb
her
so
saying
she
led
the
way
and
i
followed
her
we
found
the
sick
woman
lying
on
a
little
poor
but
clean
bed
pale
and
emaciated
but
she
did
not
seem
so
near
her
end
as
fanny
affection
had
made
her
apprehend
after
some
kind
expressions
of
concern
lady
belfield
inquired
into
their
circumstances
which
she
found
were
deplorable
but
for
that
dear
girl
madam
i
should
have
perished
with
want
said
the
good
woman
since
our
misfortunes
i
have
had
nothing
to
support
me
but
what
she
earns
by
making
these
flowers
she
has
ruined
her
own
health
by
sitting
up
the
greatest
part
of
the
night
to
procure
me
necessaries
while
she
herself
lives
on
a
crust
i
was
so
affected
with
this
scene
that
i
drew
lady
belfield
into
the
next
room
if
we
can
not
preserve
the
mother
at
least
let
us
save
the
daughter
from
destruction
said
i
you
may
command
my
purse
i
was
thinking
of
the
same
thing
she
replied
pray
my
good
girl
what
sort
of
education
have
you
had
o
madam
said
she
one
much
too
high
for
my
situation
but
my
parents
intending
to
qualify
me
for
a
governess
as
the
safest
way
of
providing
for
me
have
had
me
taught
every
thing
necessary
for
that
employment
i
have
had
the
best
masters
and
i
hope
i
have
not
misemployed
my
time
how
comes
it
then
said
i
that
you
were
not
placed
out
in
some
family
what
sir
and
leave
my
dear
mother
helpless
and
forlorn
i
had
rather
live
only
on
my
tea
and
dry
bread
which
indeed
i
have
done
for
many
months
and
supply
her
little
wants
than
enjoy
all
the
luxuries
in
the
world
at
a
distance
from
her
what
were
your
misfortunes
occasioned
by
said
i
while
lady
belfield
was
talking
with
the
mother
one
trouble
followed
another
sir
said
she
but
what
most
completely
ruined
us
and
sent
my
father
to
prison
and
brought
a
paralytic
stroke
on
my
mother
was
his
being
arrested
for
a
debt
of
seven
hundred
pounds
this
sum
which
he
had
promised
to
pay
was
long
due
to
him
for
laces
and
to
my
mother
for
millinery
and
fancy
dresses
from
a
lady
who
has
not
paid
it
to
this
moment
and
my
father
is
dead
and
my
mother
dying
this
sum
would
have
saved
them
both
she
was
turning
away
to
conceal
the
excess
of
her
grief
when
a
venerable
clergyman
entered
the
room
it
was
the
rector
of
the
parish
who
came
frequently
to
administer
spiritual
consolation
to
the
poor
woman
lady
belfield
knew
him
slightly
and
highly
respected
his
character
she
took
him
aside
and
questioned
him
as
to
the
disposition
and
conduct
of
these
people
especially
the
young
woman
his
testimony
was
highly
satisfactory
the
girl
he
said
had
not
only
had
an
excellent
education
but
her
understanding
and
principles
were
equally
good
he
added
that
he
reckoned
her
beauty
among
her
misfortunes
it
made
good
people
afraid
to
take
her
into
the
house
and
exposed
her
to
danger
from
those
of
the
opposite
description
i
put
my
purse
into
lady
belfield
hands
declining
to
make
any
present
myself
lest
after
the
remark
he
had
just
made
i
should
incur
the
suspicions
of
the
worthy
clergyman
we
promised
to
call
again
the
next
day
and
took
our
leave
but
not
till
we
had
possessed
ourselves
of
as
many
flowers
as
she
could
spare
i
begged
that
we
might
stop
and
send
some
medical
assistance
to
the
sick
woman
for
though
it
was
evident
that
all
relief
was
hopeless
yet
it
would
be
a
comfort
to
the
affectionate
girl
heart
to
know
that
nothing
was
omitted
which
might
restore
her
mother
chapter
xii
in
the
evening
we
talked
over
our
little
adventure
with
sir
john
who
entered
warmly
into
the
distresses
of
fanny
and
was
inclined
to
adopt
our
opinion
that
if
her
character
and
attainments
stood
the
test
of
a
strict
inquiry
she
might
hereafter
be
transplanted
into
their
family
as
governess
we
were
interrupted
in
the
formation
of
this
plan
by
a
visit
from
lady
melbury
the
acknowledged
queen
of
beauty
and
of
ton
i
had
long
been
acquainted
with
her
character
for
her
charms
and
her
accomplishments
were
the
theme
of
every
man
of
fashion
and
the
envy
of
every
modish
woman
she
is
one
of
those
admired
but
pitiable
characters
who
sent
by
providence
as
an
example
to
their
sex
degrade
themselves
into
a
warning
feeling
liberal
on
the
one
hand
on
the
other
vain
sentimental
romantic
extravagantly
addicted
to
dissipation
and
expense
and
with
that
union
of
contrarieties
which
distinguishes
her
equally
devoted
to
poetry
and
gaming
to
liberality
and
injustice
she
is
too
handsome
to
be
envious
and
too
generous
to
have
any
relish
for
detraction
but
she
gives
to
excess
into
the
opposite
fault
as
lady
denham
can
detect
blemishes
in
the
most
perfect
lady
melbury
finds
perfections
in
the
most
depraved
from
a
judgment
which
can
not
discriminate
a
temper
which
will
not
censure
and
a
hunger
for
popularity
which
can
feed
on
the
coarsest
applause
she
flatters
egregiously
and
universally
on
the
principle
of
being
paid
back
usuriously
in
the
same
coin
prodigal
of
her
beauty
she
exists
but
on
the
homage
paid
to
it
from
the
at
james
to
the
mob
at
an
election
candor
in
her
is
as
mischievous
as
calumny
in
others
for
it
buoys
up
characters
which
ought
to
sink
not
content
with
being
blind
to
the
bad
qualities
of
her
favorites
she
invents
good
ones
for
them
and
you
would
suppose
her
corrupt
little
senate
was
a
choir
of
seraphims
a
recent
circumstance
related
by
sir
john
was
quite
characteristical
her
favorite
maid
was
dangerously
ill
and
earnestly
begged
to
see
her
lady
who
always
had
loaded
her
with
favors
to
all
company
she
talked
of
the
virtues
of
the
poor
toinette
for
whom
she
not
only
expressed
but
felt
real
compassion
instead
of
one
apothecary
who
would
have
sufficed
two
physicians
were
sent
for
and
she
herself
resolved
to
go
up
and
visit
her
as
soon
as
she
had
finished
setting
to
music
an
elegy
on
the
death
of
her
java
sparrow
just
as
she
had
completed
it
she
received
a
fresh
entreaty
to
see
her
maid
and
was
actually
got
to
the
door
in
order
to
go
up
stairs
when
the
milliner
came
in
with
such
a
distracting
variety
of
beautiful
new
things
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
letting
them
go
till
she
had
tried
every
thing
on
one
after
the
other
this
took
up
no
little
time
to
determine
which
she
should
keep
and
which
return
where
all
was
so
attractive
took
up
still
more
after
numberless
vicissitudes
and
fluctuations
of
racking
thought
it
was
at
length
decided
she
should
take
the
whole
the
milliner
withdrew
the
lady
went
up
toinette
had
just
expired
i
found
her
manners
no
less
fascinating
than
her
person
with
all
her
modish
graces
there
was
a
tincture
of
romance
and
an
appearance
of
softness
and
sensibility
which
gave
her
the
variety
of
two
characters
she
was
the
enchanting
woman
of
fashion
and
the
elegiac
muse
lady
belfield
had
taken
care
to
cover
her
with
flowers
with
a
view
to
attract
any
chance
visitor
lady
melbury
admired
them
excessively
you
must
do
more
than
admire
them
said
lady
belfield
you
must
buy
and
recommend
she
then
told
her
the
affecting
scene
we
had
witnessed
and
described
the
amiable
girl
who
supported
the
dying
mother
by
making
these
flowers
it
is
quite
enchanting
continued
she
resolving
to
attack
lady
melbury
in
her
own
sentimental
way
to
see
this
sweet
girl
twisting
and
forming
hyacinths
into
bouquets
dear
how
charming
exclaimed
lady
melbury
it
is
really
quite
touching
i
will
make
a
subscription
for
her
and
write
at
the
head
of
the
list
a
melting
description
of
her
case
she
shall
bring
me
all
her
flowers
and
as
many
more
as
she
can
make
but
no
we
will
make
a
party
and
go
and
see
her
you
shall
carry
me
how
interesting
to
see
a
beautiful
creature
making
roses
and
hyacinths
her
delicate
hands
and
fair
complexion
must
be
amazingly
set
off
by
the
contrast
of
the
bright
flowers
if
it
were
a
girl
spinning
hemp
to
be
sure
one
should
pity
her
but
it
would
not
be
half
so
moving
it
will
be
delightful
i
will
call
on
you
exactly
at
two
and
carry
you
all
perhaps
whispered
she
to
lady
belfield
i
may
work
up
the
circumstances
into
a
sonnet
do
think
of
a
striking
title
for
it
on
second
thoughts
the
sonnet
shall
be
sent
about
with
the
subscription
and
i
get
a
pretty
vignette
to
suit
it
that
fine
creature
said
sir
john
in
an
accent
of
compassion
as
she
went
out
was
made
for
nobler
purposes
how
grievously
does
she
fall
short
of
the
high
expectations
her
early
youth
had
raised
oh
what
a
sad
return
does
she
make
to
providence
for
his
rich
and
varied
bounties
vain
of
her
beauty
lavish
of
her
money
careless
of
her
reputation
associating
with
the
worst
company
yet
formed
for
the
best
living
on
the
adulation
of
parasites
whose
understanding
she
despises
i
grieve
to
compare
what
she
is
with
what
she
might
have
been
had
she
married
a
man
of
spirit
who
would
prudently
have
guided
and
tenderly
have
restrained
her
he
has
ruined
her
and
himself
by
his
indifference
and
easiness
of
temper
satisfied
with
knowing
how
much
she
is
admired
and
he
envied
he
never
thought
of
reproving
or
restricting
her
he
is
proud
of
her
but
has
no
particular
delight
in
her
company
and
trusting
to
her
honor
lets
her
follow
her
own
devices
while
he
follows
his
she
is
a
striking
instance
of
the
eccentricity
of
that
bounty
which
springs
from
mere
sympathy
and
feeling
her
charity
requires
stage
effect
objects
that
have
novelty
and
circumstances
which
as
bayes
says
and
surprise
she
lost
when
an
infant
her
mother
a
woman
of
sense
and
piety
who
had
she
lived
would
have
formed
the
ductile
mind
of
the
daughter
turned
her
various
talents
into
other
channels
and
raised
her
character
to
the
elevation
it
was
meant
to
reach
how
melancholy
a
consideration
is
it
said
i
that
so
superior
a
woman
should
live
so
much
below
her
high
destination
she
is
doubtless
utterly
destitute
of
any
thought
of
religion
you
are
much
mistaken
replied
sir
john
i
will
not
indeed
venture
to
pronounce
that
she
entertains
much
about
it
but
she
by
no
means
denies
its
truth
nor
neglects
occasionally
to
exhibit
its
outward
and
visible
signs
she
has
not
yet
completely
forgotten
all
that
the
nurse
and
all
the
priest
have
taught
i
do
not
think
that
like
lady
denham
she
considers
it
as
a
commutation
but
she
preserves
it
as
a
habit
a
religious
exercise
however
never
interferes
with
a
worldly
one
they
are
taken
up
in
succession
but
with
this
distinction
the
worldly
business
is
to
be
done
the
religious
one
is
not
altogether
to
be
left
undone
she
has
a
moral
chemistry
which
excels
in
the
amalgamation
of
contradictory
ingredients
on
a
sunday
at
melbury
castle
if
by
any
strange
accident
she
and
her
lord
happen
to
be
there
together
she
first
reads
him
a
sermon
and
plays
at
cribbage
with
him
the
rest
of
the
evening
in
town
one
sunday
when
she
had
a
cold
she
wrote
a
tract
on
the
sacrament
for
her
maids
and
then
sat
up
all
night
at
deep
play
she
declared
if
she
had
been
successful
she
would
have
given
her
winnings
to
charity
but
as
she
lost
some
hundreds
she
said
she
could
now
with
a
safe
conscience
borrow
that
sum
from
her
charity
purse
which
she
had
hoped
to
add
to
it
to
pay
her
debt
of
honor
next
day
within
two
hours
of
her
appointed
time
she
came
and
was
complimented
by
sir
john
on
her
punctuality
indeed
said
she
i
rather
late
but
i
met
with
such
a
fascinating
german
novel
that
it
positively
chained
me
to
my
bed
till
past
three
i
assure
you
i
never
lose
time
by
not
rising
in
the
course
of
a
few
winters
i
have
exhausted
half
hookham
catalogue
before
some
of
my
acquaintance
are
awake
or
i
myself
out
of
bed
we
soon
stopped
at
the
humble
door
of
which
we
were
in
search
sir
john
conducted
lady
melbury
up
the
little
winding
stairs
i
assisted
lady
belfield
we
reached
the
room
where
fanny
was
just
finishing
a
beautiful
bunch
of
jonquils
how
picturesque
whispered
lady
melbury
to
me
do
lend
me
your
pencil
i
must
take
a
sketch
of
that
sweet
girl
with
the
jonquils
in
her
hand
my
dear
creature
continued
she
you
must
not
only
let
me
have
these
but
you
must
make
me
twelve
dozen
more
flowers
as
fast
as
possible
and
be
sure
let
me
have
a
great
many
sprigs
of
jessamine
and
myrtle
then
snatching
up
a
wreath
of
various
colored
geraniums
i
must
try
this
on
my
head
by
the
glass
so
saying
she
ran
into
an
adjoining
room
the
door
of
which
was
open
lady
belfield
having
before
stolen
into
it
to
speak
to
the
poor
invalid
as
soon
as
lady
melbury
got
into
the
room
she
uttered
a
loud
shriek
sir
john
and
i
ran
in
and
were
shocked
to
find
her
near
fainting
oh
belfield
said
she
this
is
a
trick
and
a
most
cruel
one
why
did
you
not
tell
me
where
you
were
bringing
me
why
did
you
not
tell
me
the
people
name
i
have
never
heard
it
myself
said
sir
john
on
my
honor
i
do
not
understand
you
you
know
as
much
of
the
woman
as
i
know
said
lady
belfield
alas
much
more
cried
she
as
fast
as
her
tears
would
give
her
leave
to
speak
she
retired
to
the
window
for
air
wringing
her
hands
and
called
for
a
glass
of
water
to
keep
her
from
fainting
i
turned
to
the
sick
woman
for
an
explanation
i
saw
her
countenance
much
changed
this
sir
said
she
is
the
lady
whose
debt
of
seven
hundred
pounds
ruined
me
and
was
the
death
of
my
husband
i
was
thunderstruck
but
went
to
assist
lady
melbury
who
implored
sir
john
to
go
home
with
her
instantly
saying
her
coach
should
come
back
for
us
but
dear
lady
belfield
do
lend
me
twenty
guineas
i
have
not
a
shilling
about
me
then
my
dear
lady
melbury
said
lady
belfield
how
you
order
twelve
dozen
expensive
flowers
oh
said
she
i
did
not
mean
to
have
paid
for
them
till
next
year
and
how
replied
lady
belfield
could
the
debt
which
was
not
to
have
been
paid
for
a
twelvemonth
have
relieved
the
pressing
wants
of
a
creature
who
must
pay
ready
money
for
her
materials
however
as
you
are
so
distressed
we
will
contrive
to
do
without
your
money
i
would
pawn
my
diamond
necklace
directly
returned
she
but
speaking
lower
to
own
the
truth
it
is
already
in
the
jeweler
hands
and
i
wear
a
paste
necklace
of
the
same
form
sir
john
knowing
i
had
been
at
my
banker
that
morning
gave
me
such
a
significant
look
as
restrained
my
hand
which
was
already
on
my
in
great
seeming
anguish
she
gave
sir
john
her
hand
who
conducted
her
to
her
coach
as
he
was
leading
her
down
stairs
she
solemnly
declared
she
would
never
again
run
in
debt
never
order
more
things
than
she
wanted
and
above
all
would
never
play
while
she
lived
she
was
miserable
because
she
durst
not
ask
lord
melbury
to
pay
this
woman
he
having
already
given
her
money
three
times
for
the
purpose
which
she
had
lost
at
faro
then
retracting
she
protested
if
ever
she
touch
a
card
again
it
should
be
for
the
sole
purpose
of
getting
something
to
discharge
this
debt
sir
john
earnestly
conjured
her
not
to
lay
that
flattering
unction
to
her
soul
but
to
convert
the
present
vexation
into
an
occasion
of
felicity
by
making
it
the
memorable
and
happy
era
of
abandoning
a
practice
which
injured
her
fortune
her
fame
her
principles
and
her
peace
poor
thing
said
sir
john
when
he
repeated
this
to
us
ease
will
recant
vows
made
in
pain
as
violent
and
void
in
an
interval
of
weeping
she
told
me
added
he
that
she
was
to
be
at
the
opera
to
the
opera
faro
will
succeed
and
probably
the
diamond
earrings
will
go
to
grey
in
pursuit
of
the
necklace
lady
belfield
inquired
of
fanny
how
it
happened
that
lady
melbury
who
talked
with
without
surprise
or
emotion
discovered
so
much
of
both
at
the
bare
sight
of
her
mother
the
girl
explained
this
by
saying
that
she
had
never
been
in
the
way
while
they
lived
in
when
her
ladyship
used
to
come
having
been
always
employed
in
an
upper
room
or
attending
her
masters
before
we
parted
effectual
measures
were
taken
for
the
comfortable
subsistence
of
the
sick
mother
and
for
alleviating
the
sorrows
and
lightening
the
labors
of
her
daughter
and
next
morning
i
set
out
on
my
journey
for
stanley
grove
sir
john
and
lady
belfield
promising
to
follow
me
in
a
few
weeks
as
soon
as
i
got
into
my
and
fairly
turned
my
back
on
london
i
fell
into
a
variety
of
reflections
on
the
persons
with
whom
i
had
been
living
in
this
soliloquy
i
was
particularly
struck
with
that
discrepancy
of
characters
all
of
which
are
yet
included
under
the
broad
comprehensive
appellation
of
i
found
that
though
all
differed
widely
from
each
other
they
differed
still
more
widely
from
that
rule
by
which
they
professed
to
walk
yet
not
one
of
these
characters
was
considered
as
disreputable
there
was
not
one
that
was
profane
or
profligate
not
one
who
would
not
in
conversation
have
defended
christianity
if
its
truth
had
been
attacked
not
one
who
derided
or
even
neglected
its
forms
and
who
in
her
own
class
would
not
have
passed
for
religious
yet
how
little
had
any
one
of
them
adorned
the
profession
she
adopted
of
ranby
fentham
lady
bab
lawless
lady
denham
lady
melbury
which
of
them
would
not
have
been
startled
had
her
christianity
been
called
in
question
yet
how
merely
speculative
was
the
religion
of
even
the
most
serious
among
them
how
superficial
or
inconsistent
or
mistaken
or
hollow
or
hypocritical
or
was
that
of
all
the
others
had
either
of
them
been
asked
from
what
source
she
drew
her
religion
she
would
indignantly
have
answered
from
the
bible
yet
if
we
compare
the
copy
with
the
model
the
christian
with
christianity
how
little
can
we
trace
the
resemblance
in
what
particular
did
their
lives
imitate
the
life
of
him
pleased
not
who
the
will
of
his
who
about
doing
how
irreconcilable
is
their
faith
with
the
principles
which
he
taught
how
dissimilar
their
practice
with
the
precepts
he
delivered
how
inconsistent
their
lives
with
the
example
he
bequeathed
how
unfounded
their
hope
of
heaven
if
an
entrance
into
heaven
be
restricted
to
those
who
are
minded
with
chapter
xiii
my
father
had
been
early
in
life
intimately
connected
with
the
family
of
stanley
though
this
gentleman
was
his
junior
by
several
years
yet
there
subsisted
between
them
such
a
similarity
of
tastes
sentiments
views
and
principles
that
they
lived
in
the
closest
friendship
and
both
their
families
having
in
the
early
part
of
their
lives
resided
in
london
the
occasions
of
that
thorough
mutual
knowledge
that
grows
out
of
familiar
intercourse
were
much
facilitated
i
remembered
stanley
when
i
was
a
very
little
boy
paying
an
annual
visit
to
my
father
at
the
priory
and
i
had
retained
an
imperfect
but
pleasing
impression
of
his
countenance
and
engaging
manners
having
had
a
large
estate
left
him
in
hampshire
he
settled
there
on
his
marriage
an
intercourse
of
letters
had
kept
up
the
mutual
attachment
between
him
and
my
father
on
the
death
of
each
parent
i
had
received
a
cordial
invitation
to
come
and
soothe
my
sorrows
in
his
society
my
father
enjoined
me
that
one
of
my
first
visits
after
his
death
should
be
to
the
grove
and
in
truth
i
now
considered
my
hampshire
engagement
as
the
of
my
southern
excursion
i
reached
stanley
grove
before
dinner
i
found
a
spacious
mansion
suited
to
the
ample
fortune
and
liberal
spirit
of
its
possessor
i
was
highly
gratified
with
fine
forest
scenery
in
the
approach
to
the
park
the
house
had
a
noble
appearance
without
and
within
it
was
at
once
commodious
and
elegant
it
stood
on
the
south
side
of
a
hill
nearer
the
bottom
than
the
summit
and
was
sheltered
on
the
by
a
fine
old
wood
the
park
though
it
was
not
very
extensive
was
striking
from
the
beautiful
inequality
of
the
ground
which
was
richly
clothed
with
the
most
picturesque
oaks
i
ever
saw
interspersed
with
stately
beeches
the
grounds
were
laid
out
in
good
taste
but
though
the
hand
of
modern
improvement
was
visible
the
owner
had
in
one
instance
spared
the
obsolete
prolixity
of
shade
for
which
the
most
interesting
of
poets
so
pathetically
pleads
the
poet
plea
had
saved
the
avenue
i
was
cordially
welcomed
by
and
stanley
and
by
that
powerful
and
instantaneous
impression
which
fine
sense
and
good
breeding
joined
to
high
previous
veneration
of
character
produce
on
the
feelings
of
the
guest
i
at
once
felt
myself
at
home
all
the
preliminaries
of
gradual
acquaintance
were
in
a
manner
superseded
and
i
soon
experienced
that
warm
and
affectionate
esteem
which
seemed
scarcely
to
require
intercourse
to
strengthen
or
time
to
confirm
it
stanley
had
only
a
few
minutes
to
present
me
to
his
lady
and
two
lovely
daughters
before
we
were
summoned
to
dinner
to
which
a
considerable
party
had
been
invited
for
the
neighborhood
was
populous
and
rather
polished
the
conversation
after
dinner
was
rational
animated
and
instructive
i
observed
that
stanley
lost
no
opportunity
which
fairly
offered
for
suggesting
useful
reflections
but
what
chiefly
struck
me
in
his
manner
of
conversing
was
that
without
ever
pressing
religion
unseasonably
into
the
service
he
had
the
talent
of
making
the
most
ordinary
topics
subservient
to
instruction
and
of
extracting
some
profitable
hint
or
striking
out
some
important
light
from
subjects
which
in
ordinary
hands
would
have
been
unproductive
of
improvement
it
was
evident
that
piety
was
the
predominating
principle
of
his
mind
and
that
he
was
consulting
its
interests
as
carefully
when
prudence
made
him
forbear
to
press
it
as
when
propriety
allowed
him
to
introduce
it
this
piety
was
rather
visible
in
the
sentiment
than
the
phrase
he
was
of
opinion
that
bad
taste
could
never
advance
the
interests
of
christianity
and
he
gave
less
offense
to
worldly
men
than
most
religious
people
i
have
known
because
though
he
would
on
no
human
consideration
abate
one
atom
of
zeal
or
lower
any
doctrine
nor
disguise
any
truth
nor
palliate
nor
trim
nor
compromise
yet
he
never
contended
for
words
or
trifling
distinctions
he
thought
it
detracted
from
no
man
piety
to
bring
all
his
elegance
of
expression
his
correctness
of
taste
and
his
accuracy
of
reasoning
to
the
service
of
that
cause
which
lies
the
nearest
to
the
heart
of
every
christian
and
demands
the
exertion
of
his
best
faculties
he
was
also
forward
to
promote
subjects
of
practical
use
in
the
affairs
of
common
life
suited
to
the
several
circumstances
and
pursuits
of
his
guests
but
he
particularly
rejoiced
that
there
was
so
broad
and
safe
and
uninclosed
a
field
as
general
literature
this
he
observed
always
supplies
men
of
education
with
an
ample
refuge
from
all
vulgar
and
dangerous
and
unproductive
topics
if
we
can
not
said
he
by
friendly
intercourse
always
raise
our
principles
we
may
always
keep
our
understanding
in
exercise
and
those
authors
who
supply
so
peccable
a
creature
as
man
with
subjects
of
elegant
and
innocent
discussion
i
do
not
reckon
among
the
lowest
benefactors
of
mankind
in
my
further
acquaintance
with
stanley
i
have
sometimes
observed
with
what
address
he
has
converted
a
merely
moral
passage
to
a
religious
purpose
i
have
known
him
when
conversing
with
a
man
who
would
not
have
relished
a
more
sacred
authority
seize
on
a
sentiment
in
offices
for
the
lowest
degree
in
his
scale
of
morals
and
then
gradually
ascending
trace
and
exalt
the
same
thought
through
paley
or
johnson
or
addison
or
bacon
till
he
has
unsuspectedly
landed
his
opponent
in
the
pure
ethics
of
the
gospel
and
surprised
him
into
the
adoption
of
a
christian
principle
as
i
had
heard
there
was
a
fine
little
flock
of
children
i
was
surprised
and
almost
disappointed
every
time
the
door
opened
not
to
see
them
appear
for
i
already
began
to
take
an
interest
in
all
that
related
to
this
most
engaging
family
the
ladies
having
to
our
great
gratification
sat
longer
than
is
usual
at
most
tables
at
length
obeyed
the
signal
of
the
mistress
of
the
house
they
withdrew
followed
by
the
miss
stanleys
with
grace
which
won
who
saw
to
wish
their
stay
after
their
departure
the
conversation
was
not
changed
there
was
no
occasion
it
could
not
become
more
rational
and
we
did
not
desire
that
it
should
become
less
pure
stanley
and
her
fair
friends
had
taken
their
share
in
it
with
a
good
sense
and
delicacy
which
raised
the
tone
of
our
society
and
we
did
not
give
them
to
understand
by
a
loud
laugh
before
they
were
out
of
hearing
that
we
rejoiced
in
being
emancipated
from
the
restraint
of
their
presence
stanley
is
a
graceful
and
elegant
woman
among
a
thousand
other
excellences
she
is
distinguished
for
her
judgment
in
adapting
her
discourse
to
the
character
of
her
guests
and
for
being
singularly
skillful
in
selecting
her
topics
of
conversation
i
never
saw
a
lady
who
possessed
the
talent
of
diffusing
at
her
table
so
much
pleasure
to
those
around
her
without
the
smallest
deviation
from
her
own
dignified
purity
she
asks
such
questions
as
strangers
may
be
likely
to
gain
at
least
not
to
lose
credit
by
answering
and
she
suits
her
interrogations
to
the
kind
of
knowledge
they
may
be
supposed
likely
to
possess
by
this
two
ends
are
answered
while
she
gives
her
guest
an
occasion
of
appearing
to
advantage
she
puts
herself
in
the
way
of
gaining
some
information
from
want
of
this
discernment
i
have
known
ladies
ask
a
gentleman
just
arrived
from
the
east
indies
questions
about
america
and
others
from
the
absence
of
that
true
delicacy
which
where
it
exists
shows
itself
even
on
the
smallest
occasions
who
have
inquired
of
a
person
how
he
liked
such
a
book
though
she
knew
that
in
the
nature
of
things
there
was
no
probability
of
his
ever
having
heard
of
it
thus
assuming
an
ungenerous
superiority
herself
and
mortifying
another
by
a
sense
of
his
own
comparative
ignorance
if
there
is
any
one
at
table
who
from
his
station
has
least
claim
to
attention
he
is
sure
to
be
treated
with
particular
kindness
by
stanley
and
the
diffident
never
fail
to
be
encouraged
and
the
modest
to
be
brought
forward
by
the
kindness
and
refinement
of
her
attentions
when
we
were
summoned
to
the
i
was
delighted
to
see
four
beautiful
children
fresh
as
health
and
gay
as
youth
could
make
them
busily
engaged
with
the
ladies
one
was
romping
another
singing
a
third
was
showing
some
drawings
of
birds
the
natural
history
of
which
she
seemed
to
understand
a
fourth
had
spread
a
dissected
map
on
the
carpet
and
had
pulled
down
her
eldest
sister
on
the
floor
to
show
her
copenhagen
it
was
an
animating
scene
i
could
have
devoured
the
sweet
creatures
i
got
credit
with
the
little
singer
by
helping
her
to
a
line
which
she
had
forgotten
and
with
the
geographer
by
my
superior
acquaintance
with
the
shores
of
the
baltic
in
the
evening
when
the
company
had
left
us
i
asked
stanley
how
she
came
so
far
to
deviate
from
established
custom
as
not
to
produce
her
children
immediately
after
dinner
you
must
ask
me
said
stanley
smiling
for
it
was
i
who
first
ventured
to
suggest
this
bold
innovation
i
love
my
children
fondly
but
my
children
i
have
always
at
home
i
have
my
friends
but
seldom
and
i
do
not
choose
that
any
portion
of
the
time
that
i
wish
to
dedicate
to
intellectual
and
social
enjoyment
should
be
broken
in
upon
by
another
and
an
interfering
pleasure
which
i
have
always
within
my
reach
at
the
same
time
i
like
my
children
to
see
my
friends
company
amuses
improves
and
polishes
them
i
therefore
consulted
with
stanley
how
we
could
so
manage
as
to
enjoy
our
friends
without
locking
up
our
children
she
recommended
this
expedient
the
time
she
said
spent
by
the
ladies
from
their
leaving
the
till
the
gentlemen
came
in
to
tea
was
often
a
little
heavy
it
was
rather
an
interval
of
anticipation
than
of
enjoyment
those
ladies
who
had
not
much
had
soon
exhausted
their
admiration
of
each
other
worked
muslins
and
lace
sleeves
and
those
who
would
be
glad
to
rest
it
so
agreeably
she
therefore
proposed
to
enliven
that
dull
period
by
introducing
the
children
this
little
change
has
not
only
succeeded
in
our
own
family
but
has
been
adopted
by
many
of
our
neighbors
for
ourselves
it
has
answered
a
double
purpose
it
not
only
delights
the
little
things
but
it
delights
them
with
less
injury
than
the
usual
season
of
their
appearance
our
children
have
always
as
much
fruit
as
they
like
after
their
own
dinner
they
do
not
therefore
want
or
desire
the
fruits
the
sweetmeats
the
cakes
and
the
wine
with
which
the
guests
in
order
to
please
mamma
are
too
apt
to
cram
them
besides
poor
little
dears
it
mixes
too
much
selfishness
with
the
natural
delight
they
have
in
seeing
company
by
connecting
it
with
the
idea
of
the
good
things
they
shall
get
but
by
this
alteration
we
do
all
in
our
power
to
infuse
a
little
disinterestedness
into
the
pleasure
they
have
in
coming
to
us
we
love
them
too
tenderly
to
crib
their
little
enjoyments
so
we
give
them
two
pleasures
instead
of
one
for
they
have
their
dessert
and
our
company
in
succession
though
i
do
not
approve
of
too
great
familiarity
with
servants
yet
i
think
that
to
an
old
and
faithful
domestic
superior
consideration
is
due
my
attendant
on
my
present
tour
had
lived
in
our
family
from
his
youth
and
had
the
care
of
me
before
i
can
remember
his
fidelity
and
good
sense
and
i
may
add
his
piety
had
obtained
for
him
the
privilege
of
free
speaking
oh
sir
said
he
when
he
came
to
attend
me
next
morning
we
are
got
into
the
right
house
at
last
such
a
family
so
godly
so
sober
so
charitable
is
all
of
a
piece
here
sir
comfit
the
housekeeper
tells
me
that
her
master
and
mistress
are
the
example
of
all
the
rich
and
the
refuge
of
all
the
poor
in
the
neighborhood
and
as
to
miss
lucilla
if
the
blessing
of
them
that
are
ready
to
perish
can
send
any
body
to
heaven
she
will
go
there
sure
enough
this
rhapsody
of
honest
edwards
warmed
my
heart
and
put
me
in
mind
that
i
had
neglected
to
inquire
after
this
worthy
housekeeper
who
had
lived
with
my
grandfather
and
was
at
his
death
transplanted
into
the
family
of
stanley
i
paid
a
visit
the
first
opportunity
to
the
good
woman
in
her
room
eager
to
learn
more
of
a
family
who
much
resembled
my
own
parents
and
for
whom
i
had
already
conceived
something
more
tender
than
mere
respect
i
congratulated
comfit
on
the
happiness
of
living
in
so
valuable
a
family
in
return
she
was
even
eloquent
in
their
praises
her
mistress
she
said
was
a
pattern
for
ladies
so
strict
and
yet
so
kind
but
now
indeed
miss
lucilla
has
taken
almost
all
the
family
cares
from
her
mamma
the
day
she
was
sixteen
sir
that
is
about
two
years
and
a
half
ago
she
began
to
inspect
the
household
affairs
a
little
and
as
her
knowledge
increased
she
took
more
and
more
upon
her
miss
ph
oe
be
will
very
soon
be
old
enough
to
relieve
her
sister
but
my
mistress
wo
let
her
daughters
have
any
thing
to
do
with
family
affairs
till
they
are
almost
women
grown
both
for
fear
it
should
take
them
off
from
their
learning
and
also
give
them
a
low
turn
about
eating
and
caring
for
niceties
and
lead
them
into
vulgar
gossip
and
familiarity
with
servants
it
is
time
enough
she
says
when
their
characters
are
a
little
formed
they
will
then
gain
all
the
good
and
escape
all
the
danger
seeing
me
listen
with
the
most
eager
and
delighted
attention
the
worthy
woman
proceeded
in
summer
sir
miss
stanley
rises
at
six
and
spends
two
hours
in
her
closet
which
is
stored
with
the
best
books
at
eight
she
consults
me
on
the
state
of
provisions
and
other
family
matters
and
gives
me
a
bill
of
fare
subject
to
the
inspection
of
her
mamma
the
cook
has
great
pleasure
in
acting
under
her
direction
because
she
allows
that
miss
understands
when
things
are
well
done
and
never
finds
fault
in
the
wrong
place
which
she
says
is
a
great
mortification
in
serving
ignorant
ladies
who
praise
or
find
fault
by
chance
not
according
to
the
cook
performance
but
their
own
humor
she
looks
over
my
accounts
every
week
which
being
kept
so
short
give
her
but
little
trouble
and
once
a
month
she
settles
every
thing
with
her
mother
is
a
pleasure
sir
to
see
how
skillful
she
is
in
accounts
one
impose
upon
her
a
farthing
if
one
would
and
yet
she
is
so
mild
and
so
reasonable
and
so
quick
at
distinguishing
what
are
mistakes
and
what
are
willful
faults
then
she
is
so
compassionate
it
will
be
a
day
at
the
grove
sir
whenever
miss
marries
when
my
master
is
sick
she
writes
his
letters
reads
to
him
and
assists
her
mamma
in
nursing
him
after
her
morning
work
sir
does
she
come
into
company
tired
and
cross
as
ladies
do
who
have
done
nothing
or
are
but
just
up
no
she
comes
in
to
make
breakfast
for
her
parents
as
fresh
as
a
rose
and
as
gay
as
a
lark
an
hour
after
breakfast
she
and
my
master
read
some
learned
books
together
she
then
assists
in
teaching
her
little
sisters
and
never
were
children
better
instructed
one
day
in
a
week
she
sets
aside
both
for
them
and
herself
to
work
for
the
poor
whom
she
also
regularly
visits
at
their
own
cottages
two
evenings
in
the
week
for
she
says
it
would
be
troublesome
and
look
ostentatious
to
have
her
father
doors
crowded
with
poor
people
neither
could
she
get
at
their
wants
and
their
characters
half
so
well
as
by
going
herself
to
their
own
houses
my
dear
mistress
has
given
her
a
small
room
as
a
for
clothing
and
books
for
her
indigent
neighbors
in
this
room
each
of
the
younger
daughters
the
day
she
is
seven
years
old
has
her
own
drawer
with
her
name
written
on
it
and
almost
the
only
competition
among
them
is
whose
shall
be
soonest
filled
with
caps
aprons
and
handkerchiefs
the
working
day
is
commonly
concluded
by
one
of
these
charitable
visits
the
dear
creatures
are
loaded
with
their
little
crammed
with
necessaries
this
sir
is
the
day
and
it
is
always
looked
forward
to
with
pleasure
by
them
all
even
little
celia
the
youngest
who
is
but
just
turned
of
five
will
come
to
me
and
beg
for
something
good
to
put
in
her
basket
for
poor
mary
or
betty
such
a
one
i
wonder
i
do
not
see
any
thing
of
the
little
darlings
it
is
about
the
time
they
used
to
pay
me
a
visit
on
sundays
before
church
they
attend
the
village
school
when
the
week
which
has
been
carefully
hoarded
for
the
purpose
is
produced
for
rewards
to
the
most
deserving
scholars
and
yet
sir
with
all
this
you
may
be
in
the
house
a
month
without
hearing
a
word
of
the
matter
it
is
all
done
so
quietly
and
when
they
meet
at
their
meals
they
are
more
cheerful
and
gay
than
if
they
had
been
ever
so
idle
here
comfit
stopped
for
just
then
two
sweet
little
figures
presented
themselves
at
the
door
swinging
a
straw
basket
between
them
and
crying
out
in
a
little
begging
voice
pray
comfit
bestow
your
charity
we
want
something
coarse
for
the
hungry
and
something
nice
for
the
sick
poor
dame
alice
and
her
little
they
were
going
on
but
spying
me
they
colored
up
to
the
ears
and
ran
away
as
fast
as
they
could
though
i
did
all
in
my
power
to
detain
them
chapter
xiv
when
miss
stanley
came
in
to
make
breakfast
she
beautifully
exemplified
the
worthy
housekeeper
description
i
have
sometimes
seen
young
women
whose
simplicity
was
destitute
of
elegance
and
others
in
whom
a
too
elaborate
polish
had
nearly
effaced
their
native
graces
lucilla
appeared
to
unite
the
simplicity
of
nature
to
the
refinement
of
good
breeding
it
was
thus
she
struck
me
at
first
sight
i
forbore
to
form
a
decided
opinion
till
i
had
leisure
to
observe
whether
her
mind
fulfilled
all
that
her
looks
promised
lucilla
stanley
is
rather
perfectly
elegant
than
perfectly
beautiful
i
have
seen
women
as
striking
but
i
never
saw
one
so
interesting
her
beauty
is
countenance
it
is
the
stamp
of
mind
intelligibly
printed
on
the
face
it
is
not
so
much
the
symmetry
of
features
as
the
joint
triumph
of
intellect
and
sweet
temper
a
fine
old
poet
has
well
described
her
her
pure
and
eloquent
blood
spoke
in
her
cheeks
and
so
distinctly
wrought
that
one
could
almost
say
her
body
thought
her
conversation
like
her
countenance
is
compounded
of
liveliness
sensibility
and
delicacy
she
does
not
say
things
to
be
quoted
but
the
effect
of
her
conversation
is
that
it
leaves
an
impression
of
pleasure
on
the
mind
and
a
love
of
goodness
on
the
heart
she
enlivens
without
dazzling
and
entertains
without
overpowering
contented
to
please
she
has
no
ambition
to
shine
there
is
nothing
like
effort
in
her
expression
or
vanity
in
her
manner
she
has
rather
a
playful
gayety
than
a
pointed
wit
of
repartee
she
has
little
and
dislikes
it
in
others
yet
i
have
seldom
met
with
a
truer
taste
for
inoffensive
wit
this
is
indeed
the
predominating
quality
of
her
mind
and
she
may
rather
be
said
to
be
a
nice
judge
of
the
genius
of
others
than
to
be
a
genius
herself
she
has
a
quick
perception
of
whatever
is
beautiful
or
defective
in
composition
or
in
character
the
same
true
taste
pervades
her
writing
her
conversation
her
dress
her
domestic
arrangements
and
her
gardening
for
which
last
she
has
both
a
passion
and
a
talent
though
she
has
a
correct
ear
she
neither
sings
nor
plays
and
her
taste
is
so
exact
in
drawing
that
she
really
seems
to
have
compass
dans
l
oe
yet
i
never
saw
a
pencil
in
her
fingers
except
to
sketch
a
seat
or
a
bower
for
the
her
notions
are
too
just
to
allow
her
to
be
satisfied
with
mediocrity
in
any
thing
and
for
perfection
in
many
things
she
thinks
that
life
is
too
short
and
its
duties
too
various
and
important
having
five
younger
sisters
to
assist
has
induced
her
to
neglect
some
acquisitions
which
she
would
have
liked
had
she
been
an
only
daughter
she
owns
that
she
would
have
indulged
a
little
more
in
the
garnish
and
decoration
of
life
at
her
early
age
the
soundness
of
her
judgment
on
persons
and
things
can
not
be
derived
from
experience
she
owes
it
to
a
so
fine
as
enables
her
to
seize
on
the
strong
feature
the
prominent
circumstance
the
leading
point
instead
of
confusing
her
mind
and
dissipating
her
attention
on
the
inferior
parts
of
a
character
a
book
or
a
business
this
justness
of
thinking
teaches
her
to
rate
things
according
to
their
worth
and
to
arrange
them
according
to
their
place
her
manner
of
speaking
adds
to
the
effect
of
her
words
and
the
tone
of
her
voice
expresses
with
singular
felicity
gayety
or
kindness
as
her
feelings
direct
and
the
occasion
demands
this
manner
is
so
natural
and
her
sentiments
spring
so
spontaneously
from
the
occasion
that
it
is
obvious
that
display
is
never
in
her
head
nor
an
eagerness
for
praise
in
her
heart
i
never
heard
her
utter
a
word
which
i
could
have
wished
unsaid
or
a
sentiment
i
could
have
wished
unthought
as
to
her
dress
it
reminds
me
of
what
johnson
once
said
to
an
acquaintance
of
mine
of
a
lady
who
was
celebrated
for
dressing
well
the
best
evidence
that
i
can
give
you
of
her
perfection
in
this
respect
is
that
one
can
never
remember
what
she
had
on
the
dress
of
lucilla
is
not
neglected
and
it
is
not
studied
she
is
as
neat
as
the
strictest
delicacy
and
as
fashionable
as
the
strictest
delicacy
and
her
form
does
not
appear
to
less
advantage
for
being
vailed
with
scrupulous
modesty
oh
if
women
in
general
knew
what
was
their
real
interest
if
they
could
guess
with
what
a
charm
even
the
of
modesty
invests
its
possessor
they
would
dress
decorously
from
mere
if
not
from
principle
the
designing
would
assume
modesty
as
an
artifice
the
coquet
would
adopt
it
as
an
allurement
the
pure
as
her
appropriate
attraction
and
the
voluptuous
as
the
most
infallible
art
of
seduction
what
i
admire
in
miss
stanley
and
what
i
have
sometime
regretted
the
want
of
in
some
other
women
is
that
i
am
told
she
is
so
lively
so
playful
so
desirous
of
amusing
her
father
and
mother
when
alone
that
they
are
seldom
so
gay
as
in
their
family
party
it
is
then
that
her
talents
are
all
unfolded
and
that
her
liveliness
is
without
restraint
she
was
rather
silent
the
two
or
three
first
days
after
my
arrival
yet
it
was
evidently
not
the
silence
of
reserve
or
inattention
but
of
delicate
propriety
her
gentle
frankness
and
undesigning
temper
gradually
got
the
better
of
this
little
shyness
and
she
soon
began
to
treat
me
as
the
son
of
her
father
friend
i
very
early
found
that
though
a
stranger
might
behold
her
without
admiration
it
was
impossible
to
converse
with
her
with
indifference
before
i
had
been
a
week
at
the
grove
my
precautions
vanished
my
panoply
was
gone
and
yet
i
had
not
consulted
stanley
in
contemplating
the
captivating
figure
and
the
delicate
mind
of
this
charming
girl
i
felt
that
imagination
which
misleads
so
many
youthful
hearts
had
preserved
mine
the
image
my
fancy
had
framed
and
which
had
been
suggested
by
milton
heroine
had
been
refined
indeed
but
it
had
not
been
romantic
i
had
early
formed
an
ideal
standard
in
my
mind
too
high
perhaps
but
its
very
elevation
had
rescued
me
from
the
common
dangers
attending
the
society
of
the
sex
i
was
continually
comparing
the
women
with
whom
i
conversed
with
the
fair
conception
which
filled
my
mind
the
comparison
might
be
unfair
to
them
i
am
sure
it
was
not
unfavorable
to
myself
for
it
preserved
me
from
the
fascination
of
mere
personal
beauty
the
allurements
of
fictitious
character
and
the
attractions
of
ordinary
merit
i
am
aware
that
love
is
apt
to
throw
a
radiance
around
the
being
it
prefers
till
it
becomes
dazzled
less
perhaps
with
the
brightness
of
the
object
itself
than
with
the
beams
with
which
imagination
has
invested
it
but
religion
though
it
had
not
subdued
my
imagination
had
chastised
it
it
had
sobered
the
splendors
of
fancy
without
obscuring
them
it
had
not
extinguished
the
passions
but
it
had
taught
me
to
regulate
i
now
seemed
to
have
found
the
being
of
whom
i
had
been
in
search
my
mind
felt
her
excellences
my
heart
acknowledged
its
conqueror
i
struggled
however
not
to
abandon
myself
to
its
impulses
i
endeavored
to
keep
my
own
feelings
in
order
till
i
had
time
to
appreciate
a
character
which
appeared
as
artless
as
it
was
correct
and
i
did
not
allow
myself
to
make
this
slight
sketch
of
lucilla
and
of
the
effect
she
produced
on
my
heart
till
more
intimate
acquaintance
had
justified
my
prepossessions
but
let
me
not
forget
that
stanley
had
another
daughter
if
lucilla
character
is
more
elevated
ph
oe
be
is
not
less
amiable
her
face
is
equally
handsome
but
her
figure
is
somewhat
less
delicate
she
has
a
fine
temper
and
strong
virtues
the
little
faults
she
has
seem
to
flow
from
the
excess
of
her
good
qualities
her
susceptibility
is
extreme
and
to
guide
and
guard
it
finds
employment
for
her
mother
fondness
and
her
father
prudence
her
heart
overflows
with
gratitude
for
the
smallest
service
this
warmth
of
her
tenderness
keeps
her
affections
in
more
lively
exercise
than
her
judgment
it
leads
her
to
the
merit
of
those
she
loves
and
to
estimate
their
excellences
less
by
their
own
worth
than
by
their
kindness
to
her
she
soon
behaved
to
me
with
the
most
engaging
frankness
and
her
innocent
vivacity
encouraged
in
return
that
affectionate
freedom
with
which
one
treats
a
beloved
sister
the
other
children
are
gay
lovely
interesting
and
their
several
acquisitions
for
i
detest
the
term
since
it
has
been
warped
from
the
true
meaning
in
which
milton
used
it
seem
to
be
so
many
individual
contributions
brought
in
to
enrich
the
common
stock
of
domestic
delight
their
talents
are
never
put
into
exercise
by
artificial
excitements
habitual
industry
quiet
exertion
successive
employments
affectionate
intercourse
and
gay
and
animated
relaxation
make
up
the
round
of
their
cheerful
day
i
could
not
forbear
admiring
in
this
happy
family
the
graceful
union
of
piety
with
cheerfulness
strictness
of
principle
embellished
but
never
relaxed
by
gayety
of
manners
a
gayety
not
such
as
requires
turbulent
pleasures
to
stimulate
it
but
evidently
the
serene
yet
animated
result
of
minds
of
minds
actuated
by
a
tenderness
of
conscience
habitually
alive
to
the
perception
of
the
smallest
sin
and
kindling
into
holy
gratitude
at
the
smallest
mercy
i
often
called
to
my
mind
that
my
father
in
order
to
prevent
my
being
deceived
and
run
away
with
by
persons
who
appeared
lively
at
first
sight
had
early
accustomed
me
to
discriminate
carefully
whether
it
was
not
the
only
that
was
lively
and
the
man
dull
i
have
found
this
caution
of
no
small
use
in
my
observations
on
the
other
sex
i
had
frequently
remarked
that
the
musical
and
the
dancing
ladies
and
those
who
were
most
admired
for
modish
attainments
had
little
gayety
in
numerous
instances
i
found
that
the
mind
was
the
only
part
which
was
not
kept
in
action
and
no
wonder
for
it
was
the
only
part
which
had
received
no
previous
forming
no
preparatory
molding
when
i
mentioned
this
to
stanley
the
education
replied
he
which
now
prevails
is
a
mohammedan
education
it
consists
entirely
in
making
woman
an
object
of
attraction
there
are
however
a
few
reasonable
people
left
who
while
they
retain
the
object
improve
upon
the
plan
they
too
would
make
woman
attractive
but
it
is
by
sedulously
laboring
to
make
the
understanding
the
temper
the
mind
and
the
manners
of
their
daughters
as
engaging
as
these
circassian
parents
endeavor
to
make
the

with
his
particular
kindness
barlow
filled
up
all
my
ideas
of
a
country
clergyman
of
the
higher
class
there
is
a
uniform
consistency
runs
through
his
whole
life
and
character
which
often
brings
to
my
mind
allowing
for
the
revolution
in
habits
that
almost
two
hundred
years
have
necessarily
produced
the
incomparable
of
the
ingenious

term
parson
has
now
indeed
a
vulgar
and
disrespectful
sound
but
in
herbert
time
it
was
used
in
its
true
sense
i
would
recommend
to
those
who
have
not
seen
it
this
sketch
of
the
ancient
clerical
life
as
herbert
was
a
man
of
quality
he
knew
what
became
the
more
opulent
of
his
function
as
he
was
eminently
pious
he
practiced
all
that
he
recommended
this
appellation
of
parson
says
judge
blackstone
however
depreciated
by
clownish
and
familiar
use
is
the
most
legal
most
beneficial
and
most
honorable
title
which
a
parish
priest
can
enjoy
i
never
saw
without
said
stanley
more
exemplified
than
in
barlow
his
piety
is
as
enlightened
as
it
is
sincere
no
errors
in
religion
escape
him
through
ignorance
of
their
existence
or
through
carelessness
in
their
detection
or
through
inactivity
in
opposing
them
he
is
too
honest
not
to
attack
the
prevailing
evil
whatever
shape
it
may
assume
too
correct
to
excite
in
the
wise
any
fears
that
his
zeal
may
mislead
his
judgment
and
too
upright
to
be
afraid
of
the
censures
which
active
piety
must
ever
have
to
encounter
from
the
worldly
and
the
indifferent
from
cold
hearts
and
unfurnished
heads
from
his
affectionate
warmth
however
and
his
unremitting
application
arising
from
the
vast
importance
he
attaches
to
the
worth
of
souls
the
man
of
the
world
might
honor
him
with
the
title
of
enthusiast
while
his
prudence
and
regularity
would
draw
on
him
from
the
fanatic
the
appellation
of
formalist
though
he
is
far
from
being
to
in
decencies
he
is
careful
never
to
neglect
them
he
is
a
clergyman
all
the
week
as
well
as
on
sunday
for
he
says
if
he
did
not
spend
much
of
the
intermediate
time
in
pastoral
visits
there
could
not
be
kept
up
that
mutual
intercourse
of
kindness
which
so
much
facilitates
his
own
labors
and
his
people
improvement
they
listen
to
him
because
they
love
him
and
they
understand
him
because
he
has
familiarized
them
by
private
discourse
to
the
great
truths
which
he
delivers
from
the
pulpit
barlow
has
greatly
diminished
the
growth
of
innovation
in
his
parishes
by
attacking
the
innovator
with
his
own
weapons
not
indeed
by
stooping
to
the
same
disorderly
practices
but
by
opposing
an
enlightened
earnestness
to
an
eccentric
earnestness
a
zeal
knowledge
to
a
zeal
it
he
is
of
opinion
that
activity
does
more
good
than
invective
and
that
the
latter
is
too
often
resorted
to
because
it
is
the
cheaper
substitute
his
charity
however
is
large
and
his
spirit
truly
catholic
he
honors
all
his
truly
pious
brethren
who
are
earnest
in
doing
good
though
they
may
differ
from
him
as
to
the
manner
of
doing
it
yet
his
candor
never
intrenches
on
his
firmness
and
while
he
will
not
dispute
with
others
about
shades
of
difference
he
maintains
his
own
opinions
with
the
steadiness
of
one
who
embraced
them
on
the
fullest
conviction
he
is
a
and
being
a
good
and
a
ripe
one
it
sets
him
above
aiming
at
the
paltry
reputation
to
be
acquired
by
those
false
embellishments
of
style
those
difficult
and
uncommon
words
and
that
labored
inversion
of
sentences
by
which
some
injudicious
clergymen
make
themselves
unacceptable
to
the
higher
and
unintelligible
to
the
lower
and
of
course
the
larger
part
of
their
audience
he
always
bears
in
mind
that
the
common
people
are
not
foolish
they
are
only
ignorant
to
meet
the
one
he
preaches
good
sense
to
suit
the
other
plain
language
but
while
he
seldom
shoots
over
the
heads
of
the
uninformed
he
never
offends
the
judicious
he
considers
the
advice
of
polonius
to
his
son
to
be
as
applicable
to
preachers
as
to
travelers
be
thou
familiar
but
by
no
means
vulgar
in
his
pulpit
he
is
no
wrangling
polemic
but
a
genuine
bible
christian
deeply
impressed
himself
with
the
momentous
truths
he
so
earnestly
presses
upon
others
his
mind
is
so
imbued
so
saturated
if
i
may
hazard
the
expression
with
scriptural
knowledge
that
from
that
rich
he
is
ever
ready
to
bring
forth
new
and
and
to
apply
them
wisely
temperately
and
seasonably
though
he
carefully
inculcates
universal
holiness
in
all
his
discourses
yet
his
practical
instructions
are
constantly
deduced
from
those
fundamental
principles
of
christianity
which
are
the
root
and
life
and
spirit
of
all
goodness
next
to
a
solid
piety
and
a
deep
acquaintance
with
the
bible
he
considers
it
of
prime
importance
to
a
clergyman
to
be
thoroughly
acquainted
with
human
nature
in
general
and
with
the
state
of
his
own
parish
in
particular
the
knowledge
of
both
will
alone
preserve
him
from
preaching
too
personally
so
as
to
hurt
or
too
generally
so
as
not
to
touch
he
is
careful
not
to
hurry
over
the
prayers
in
so
cold
inattentive
and
careless
a
manner
as
to
make
the
audience
suspect
he
is
saving
himself
that
he
may
make
a
greater
figure
in
delivering
the
sermon
instead
of
this
the
devout
reverential
and
impressive
manner
in
which
he
pronounces
the
various
parts
of
the
liturgy
best
prepares
his
own
heart
and
the
hearts
of
his
people
to
receive
benefit
from
his
discourse
his
petitions
are
delivered
with
such
sober
fervor
his
exhortations
with
such
humble
dignity
his
thanksgiving
with
such
holy
animation
as
carry
the
soul
of
the
hearer
along
with
him
when
he
ascends
the
pulpit
he
never
throws
the
liturgical
service
into
the
back
ground
by
a
long
elaborate
composition
of
his
own
delivered
with
superior
force
and
emphasis
and
he
pronounces
the
lord
prayer
with
a
solemnity
which
shows
that
he
recollects
its
importance
and
its
author
in
preaching
he
is
careful
to
be
distinctly
heard
even
by
his
remotest
auditors
and
by
constant
attention
to
this
important
article
he
has
brought
his
voice
which
was
not
strong
to
be
particularly
audible
he
affixes
so
much
importance
to
a
distinct
delivery
that
he
smilingly
told
me
he
suspected
the
grammatical
definition
of
a
substantive
was
originally
meant
for
a
clergyman
whose
great
object
it
was
if
possible
be
but
indispensably
to
be
and
his
whole
performance
is
distinguished
by
a
grave
and
majestic
simplicity
as
far
removed
from
the
careless
reader
of
a
common
story
as
from
the
declamation
of
an
actor
his
hearers
leave
the
church
not
so
much
in
raptures
with
the
preacher
as
affected
with
the
truths
he
has
delivered
he
says
he
always
finds
he
has
done
most
good
when
he
has
been
least
praised
and
that
he
feels
most
humbled
when
he
receives
the
warmest
commendation
because
men
generally
extol
most
the
sermons
which
have
probed
them
least
whereas
those
which
really
do
good
being
often
such
as
make
them
most
uneasy
are
consequently
the
least
likely
to
attract
panegyric
only
bear
true
testimony
to
the
excellence
of
a
discourse
added
he
who
commend
the
composition
or
the
delivery
but
who
are
led
by
it
to
examine
their
own
hearts
to
search
out
its
corruptions
and
to
reform
their
lives
reformation
is
the
flattery
i
covet
he
is
aware
that
the
generality
of
hearers
like
to
retire
from
the
sermon
with
the
comfortable
belief
that
little
is
to
be
done
on
parts
such
hearers
he
always
disappoints
by
leaving
on
their
minds
at
the
close
some
impressive
precept
deduced
from
and
growing
out
of
the
preparatory
doctrine
he
does
not
press
any
one
truth
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others
he
proposes
no
subtleties
but
labors
to
excite
seriousness
to
alarm
the
careless
to
quicken
the
supine
to
confirm
the
doubting
he
presses
eternal
things
as
things
near
at
hand
as
things
in
which
every
living
man
has
an
equal
interest
stanley
says
that
though
barlow
was
considered
at
cambridge
as
a
correct
young
man
who
carefully
avoided
vice
and
even
irregularity
yet
being
cheerful
and
addicted
to
good
society
he
had
a
disposition
to
innocent
conviviality
which
might
unsuspectedly
have
led
him
into
the
errors
he
abhorred
he
was
struck
with
a
passage
in
a
letter
from
johnson
to
a
young
man
who
had
just
taken
orders
in
which
among
other
wholesome
counsel
he
advises
him
acquire
the
courage
to
refuse
invitations
to
dinner
it
is
inconceivable
what
a
degree
of
force
and
independence
his
mind
acquired
by
the
occasional
adoption
of
this
single
hint
he
is
not
only
stanley
the
spiritual
director
but
the
father
the
counselor
the
arbitrator
and
the
friend
of
those
whom
providence
has
placed
under
his
instruction
he
is
happy
in
an
excellent
wife
who
by
bringing
him
a
considerable
fortune
has
greatly
enlarged
his
power
of
doing
good
but
still
more
essentially
has
she
increased
his
happiness
and
raised
his
character
by
her
piety
and
prudence
by
the
large
part
she
takes
in
his
affairs
he
is
enabled
to
give
himself
wholly
up
to
the
duties
of
his
profession
she
is
as
attentive
to
the
bodies
as
her
husband
is
to
the
souls
of
his
people
and
educates
her
own
family
as
sedulously
as
he
instructs
his
parish
one
day
when
i
had
been
congratulating
barlow
on
the
excellence
of
his
wife
character
the
conversation
fell
by
a
sudden
transition
on
the
celibacy
of
the
romish
clergy
he
smiled
and
said
us
ministers
of
the
reformation
be
careful
never
to
provoke
the
people
to
wish
for
the
restoration
of
that
part
of
popery
i
often
reflect
how
peculiarly
incumbent
it
is
on
us
to
select
such
partners
as
shall
never
cause
our
emancipation
from
the
old
restrictions
to
be
regretted
and
we
ourselves
ought
by
improving
the
character
of
our
wives
to
repay
the
debt
we
owe
to
the
ecclesiastical
laws
of
protestantism
for
the
privilege
of
possessing
them
will
it
be
thought
too
trifling
to
add
how
carefully
this
valuable
pair
carry
their
consistency
into
the
most
minute
details
of
their
family
arrangements
their
daughters
are
no
less
patterns
of
decorum
and
modesty
in
their
dress
and
appearance
than
in
the
more
important
parts
of
their
conduct
the
doctor
says
the
most
distant
and
inconsiderable
appendages
to
the
temple
of
god
should
have
something
of
purity
and
decency
besides
added
he
what
face
could
i
censure
improprieties
from
the
pulpit
if
the
appearance
of
my
own
family
in
the
pew
below
were
to
set
my
precepts
at
defiance
by
giving
an
example
of
extravagance
and
vanity
to
the
parish
and
thus
by
making
the
preacher
ridiculous
make
his
expostulations
worse
than
ineffectual
so
conscientious
a
rector
added
stanley
could
not
fail
to
be
particularly
careful
in
the
choice
of
a
curate
and
a
more
humble
pious
diligent
assistant
than
jackson
could
not
easily
be
found
he
is
always
a
welcome
guest
at
my
table
but
this
valuable
man
who
was
about
as
good
a
judge
of
the
world
as
the
great
hooker
made
just
such
another
indiscreet
marriage
he
was
drawn
in
to
choose
his
wife
the
daughter
of
a
poor
tradesman
in
the
next
town
because
he
concluded
that
a
woman
bred
in
humble
and
active
life
would
necessarily
be
humble
and
active
herself
reason
for
accepting
was
because
she
thought
that
as
every
clergyman
was
a
she
of
course
as
his
wife
should
be
a
and
fit
company
for
any
body
instructs
my
parish
admirably
said
barlow
his
own
little
family
he
can
not
manage
his
wife
is
continually
reproaching
him
that
though
he
may
know
the
way
to
heaven
he
does
not
know
how
to
push
his
way
in
the
world
his
daughter
is
the
finest
lady
in
the
parish
and
outdoes
them
all
not
only
in
the
extremity
but
the
immodesty
of
the
fashion
it
is
her
mother
great
ambition
that
she
should
excel
the
miss
stanleys
and
my
daughters
in
music
while
her
good
father
linen
betrays
sad
marks
of
negligence
i
once
ventured
to
tell
jackson
that
there
was
only
one
reason
which
could
excuse
the
education
she
had
given
her
daughter
which
was
that
i
presumed
she
intended
to
qualify
her
for
getting
her
bread
and
that
if
she
would
correct
the
improprieties
of
the
girl
dress
and
get
her
instructed
in
useful
knowledge
i
would
look
out
for
a
good
situation
for
her
this
roused
her
indignation
she
refused
my
offer
with
scorn
saying
that
when
she
asked
my
charity
she
would
take
my
advice
and
desired
that
i
would
remember
that
one
clergyman
daughter
was
as
good
as
another
i
told
her
that
there
was
indeed
a
sense
in
which
one
clergyman
was
as
good
as
another
because
the
profession
dignified
the
lowest
of
the
order
if
like
her
husband
he
was
a
credit
to
that
order
yet
still
there
were
gradations
in
the
church
as
well
as
in
the
state
but
between
the
and
of
the
higher
and
lower
clergy
there
were
the
same
distinction
which
riches
and
poverty
have
established
between
those
of
the
higher
and
lower
orders
of
the
laity
and
that
rank
and
independence
in
the
one
case
confer
the
same
outward
superiority
with
rank
and
independence
in
the
other
chapter
xvi
among
the
visitors
at
stanley
grove
there
was
a
family
of
ladies
who
though
not
particularly
brilliant
were
singularly
engaging
from
their
modesty
gentleness
and
good
sense
one
day
when
they
had
just
left
us
stanley
obliged
me
with
the
following
little
relation
stanley
and
lucilla
only
being
present
lady
aston
has
been
a
widow
almost
seven
years
on
the
death
of
sir
george
she
retired
into
this
neighborhood
with
her
daughters
the
eldest
of
whom
is
about
the
age
of
lucilla
she
herself
had
had
a
pious
but
a
very
narrow
education
her
excessive
grief
for
the
loss
of
her
husband
augmented
her
natural
love
of
retirement
which
she
cultivated
not
to
the
purpose
of
improvement
but
to
the
indulgence
of
melancholy
soon
after
she
settled
here
we
heard
how
much
good
she
did
and
in
how
exemplary
a
manner
she
lived
before
we
saw
her
she
was
not
very
easy
of
access
even
to
us
and
after
we
had
made
our
way
to
her
we
were
the
only
visitors
she
admitted
for
a
long
time
we
soon
learned
to
admire
her
deadness
to
the
world
and
her
unaffected
humility
our
esteem
for
her
increased
with
our
closer
intercourse
which
however
enabled
us
also
to
observe
some
considerable
mistakes
in
her
judgment
especially
in
the
mode
in
which
she
was
training
up
her
daughters
these
errors
we
regretted
and
with
all
possible
tenderness
ventured
to
point
out
to
her
the
girls
were
the
prettiest
demure
little
nuns
you
ever
saw
mute
and
timid
cheerless
and
inactive
but
kind
good
and
gentle
their
pious
mother
who
was
naturally
of
a
fearful
and
doubting
mind
had
had
this
pensive
turn
increased
by
several
early
domestic
losses
which
even
previous
to
sir
george
death
had
contributed
to
fix
something
of
a
too
tender
and
hopeless
melancholy
on
her
whole
character
there
are
two
refuges
for
the
afflicted
two
diametrically
opposite
ways
of
getting
out
of
sorrow
religion
and
the
world
lady
aston
had
wisely
chosen
the
former
but
her
scrupulous
spirit
had
made
the
narrow
way
narrower
than
religion
required
she
read
the
scriptures
diligently
and
she
prayed
over
them
devoutly
but
she
had
no
judicious
friend
to
direct
her
in
these
important
studies
as
your
ranby
attended
only
to
the
doctrines
and
our
friend
lady
belfield
trusted
indefinitely
to
the
promises
so
poor
lady
aston
broken
spirit
was
too
exclusively
carried
to
dwell
on
the
threatenings
together
with
the
rigid
performance
of
those
duties
which
she
earnestly
hoped
might
enable
her
to
escape
them
this
round
of
duty
of
watchfulness
and
prayer
she
invariably
performed
with
almost
the
sanctity
of
an
apostle
but
with
a
little
too
much
of
the
scrupulosity
of
an
ascetic
while
too
many
were
rejoicing
with
unfounded
confidence
in
those
animating
passages
of
scripture
which
the
whole
tenor
of
their
lives
demonstrates
not
to
belong
to
them
she
trembled
at
those
denunciations
which
she
could
not
fairly
apply
to
herself
and
the
promises
from
which
she
might
have
derived
reasonable
consolation
she
overlooked
as
designed
for
others
her
piety
though
sincere
was
a
little
tinctured
with
superstition
if
any
petty
strictness
was
omitted
she
tormented
herself
with
causeless
remorse
if
any
little
rule
was
broken
she
repaired
the
failure
with
treble
diligence
the
following
day
and
labored
to
retrieve
her
perplexed
accounts
with
the
comfortless
anxiety
of
a
person
who
is
working
out
a
heavy
debt
i
endeavored
to
convince
her
that
an
inferior
duty
which
clashed
with
one
of
a
higher
order
might
be
safely
postponed
at
least
if
not
omitted
a
diary
has
been
found
useful
to
many
pious
christians
as
a
record
of
their
sins
and
of
their
mercies
but
this
poor
lady
spent
so
much
time
in
weighing
the
offenses
of
one
day
against
those
of
another
that
before
the
scruple
was
settled
the
time
for
action
was
past
she
brought
herself
into
so
much
perplexity
by
reading
over
this
journal
of
her
infirmities
that
her
difficulties
were
augmented
by
the
very
means
she
had
employed
to
remove
them
and
her
conscience
was
disturbed
by
the
method
she
had
taken
to
quiet
it
this
plan
however
though
distressing
to
a
troubled
mind
is
wholesome
to
one
of
a
contrary
cast
family
as
you
have
seen
are
rather
exact
in
the
distribution
of
their
time
but
we
do
not
distress
ourselves
at
interruptions
which
are
unavoidable
but
arrangements
were
carried
on
with
a
rigor
which
made
her
consider
the
smallest
deviation
as
a
sin
that
required
severe
repentance
her
alms
were
expiations
her
penances
she
was
rather
a
disciple
of
the
mortified
baptist
than
of
the
merciful
redeemer
her
devotions
were
sincere
but
discouraging
they
consisted
much
in
contrition
but
little
in
praise
much
in
sorrow
for
sin
but
little
in
hope
of
its
pardon
she
did
not
sufficiently
cast
her
care
and
confidence
on
the
great
propitiation
she
firmly
believed
all
that
her
saviour
had
done
and
suffered
but
she
had
not
the
comfort
of
practically
appropriating
the
sacrifice
while
she
was
painfully
working
out
her
salvation
with
fear
and
trembling
she
indulged
the
most
unfounded
apprehensions
of
the
divine
displeasure
at
aston
hall
the
almighty
was
literally
feared
but
he
was
not
glorified
it
was
the
obedience
of
a
slave
and
not
the
reverential
affection
of
a
child
when
i
saw
her
denying
herself
and
her
daughters
the
most
innocent
enjoyments
and
suspecting
sin
in
the
most
lawful
indulgences
i
took
the
liberty
to
tell
her
how
little
acceptable
uncommanded
austerities
and
arbitrary
impositions
were
to
the
god
of
mercies
i
observed
to
her
that
the
world
that
human
life
that
our
own
sins
and
weaknesses
found
us
daily
and
hourly
occasions
of
exercising
patience
and
that
life
is
not
entirely
made
up
of
great
evils
or
heavy
trials
but
that
the
perpetual
recurrence
of
petty
evils
and
small
trials
is
the
ordinary
and
appointed
exercise
of
the
christian
graces
to
bear
with
the
failings
of
those
about
us
with
their
infirmities
their
bad
judgment
their
their
perverse
tempers
to
endure
neglect
where
we
feel
we
have
deserved
attention
and
ingratitude
where
we
expected
thanks
to
bear
with
the
company
of
disagreeable
people
whom
providence
has
placed
in
our
way
and
whom
he
has
perhaps
provided
on
purpose
for
the
trial
of
our
virtue
these
are
the
best
exercises
and
the
better
because
not
chosen
by
ourselves
to
bear
with
vexations
in
business
with
disappointments
in
our
expectations
with
interruptions
of
our
retirement
with
folly
intrusion
disturbance
in
short
with
whatever
opposes
our
will
and
contradicts
our
humor
this
habitual
acquiescence
appears
to
be
more
of
the
essence
of
than
any
little
rigors
or
inflictions
of
our
own
imposing
these
constant
inevitable
but
inferior
evils
properly
improved
furnish
a
good
moral
discipline
and
might
well
in
the
days
of
ignorance
have
superseded
pilgrimage
and
penance
it
has
this
advantage
too
over
the
other
that
it
sweetens
the
temper
and
promotes
humility
while
the
former
gives
rigidness
instead
of
strength
and
inflexibility
instead
of
firmness
i
have
often
thought
said
i
when
stanley
made
a
pause
that
we
are
apt
to
mistake
our
vocation
by
looking
out
of
the
way
for
occasions
to
exercise
great
and
rare
virtues
and
by
stepping
over
those
ordinary
ones
which
lie
directly
in
the
road
before
us
when
we
read
we
fancy
we
could
be
martyrs
and
when
we
come
to
act
we
can
not
even
bear
a
provoking
word
miss
stanley
looked
pleased
at
my
remark
and
in
a
modest
tone
observed
that
in
no
one
instance
did
we
deceive
ourselves
more
than
in
fancying
we
could
do
great
things
well
which
we
were
never
likely
to
be
called
to
do
at
all
while
if
we
were
honest
we
could
not
avoid
owning
how
negligently
we
performed
our
own
little
appointed
duties
and
how
sedulously
we
avoided
the
petty
inconveniences
which
these
duties
involved
by
kindness
resumed
stanley
we
gradually
gained
lady
confidence
and
of
that
confidence
we
have
availed
ourselves
to
give
something
of
a
new
face
to
the
family
her
daughters
good
as
they
were
dutiful
by
living
in
a
solitude
unenlivened
by
books
and
unvaried
by
improving
company
had
acquired
a
manner
rather
resembling
fearfulness
than
delicacy
religious
they
were
but
they
had
contracted
gloomy
views
of
religion
they
considered
it
as
something
that
must
be
endured
in
order
to
avoid
punishment
rather
than
as
a
principle
of
peace
and
trust
and
comfort
as
a
task
to
be
gone
through
rather
than
as
a
privilege
to
be
enjoyed
they
were
tempted
to
consider
the
almighty
as
a
hard
master
whom
however
they
were
resolved
to
serve
rather
than
as
a
gracious
father
who
was
not
only
loving
but
love
in
the
abstract
their
mother
was
afraid
to
encourage
a
cheerful
look
lest
it
might
lead
to
levity
or
a
sprightly
thought
for
fear
it
might
have
a
wrong
tendency
she
forgot
or
rather
she
did
not
know
that
young
women
were
not
formed
for
contemplative
life
she
forgot
that
in
all
our
plans
and
operations
we
should
still
bear
in
mind
that
there
are
two
worlds
as
it
is
the
fault
of
too
many
to
leave
the
out
of
their
calculation
it
was
the
error
of
lady
aston
in
forming
the
minds
of
her
children
to
leave
out
she
justly
considered
heaven
as
their
great
aim
and
end
but
neglected
to
qualify
them
for
the
present
temporal
life
on
the
due
use
and
employment
of
which
so
obviously
depends
the
happiness
of
that
which
is
eternal
her
charities
were
very
extensive
but
of
these
charities
her
sweet
daughters
were
not
made
the
active
dispensers
because
an
old
servant
who
governed
not
only
the
family
but
her
lady
also
chose
that
office
herself
thus
the
bounty
being
made
to
flow
in
partial
channels
the
woman
relations
and
favorites
almost
entirely
engrossing
it
it
did
little
comparative
good
with
fair
understandings
the
miss
astons
had
acquired
very
little
knowledge
their
mother
scrupulous
mind
found
something
dangerous
in
every
author
who
did
not
professedly
write
on
religious
subjects
if
there
were
one
exceptionable
page
in
a
book
otherwise
valuable
instead
of
suppressing
the
page
she
suppressed
the
book
and
indeed
my
dear
charles
grieved
am
i
to
think
how
few
authors
of
the
more
entertaining
kind
we
consider
as
perfectly
pure
and
put
without
caution
restriction
or
mutilation
into
the
hands
of
our
daughters
i
am
however
of
opinion
that
as
they
will
not
always
have
their
parents
for
tasters
and
as
they
will
everywhere
even
in
the
most
select
libraries
meet
with
these
mixed
works
in
which
though
there
is
much
to
admire
yet
there
is
something
to
expunge
it
is
the
safest
way
to
accustom
them
early
to
hear
read
the
most
unexceptionable
parts
of
these
books
read
them
yourself
to
them
without
any
air
of
mystery
tell
them
that
what
you
omit
is
not
worth
reading
and
then
the
omissions
will
not
excite
but
stifle
curiosity
the
books
to
which
i
allude
are
those
where
the
principle
is
sound
and
the
tendency
blameless
and
where
the
few
faults
consist
rather
in
coarseness
than
in
corruption
but
to
return
she
fancied
that
these
inexperienced
creatures
who
had
never
tried
the
world
and
whose
young
imaginations
had
perhaps
painted
it
in
all
the
brilliant
colors
with
which
erring
fancy
gilds
the
scenes
it
has
never
beheld
and
the
pleasure
it
has
never
tried
could
renounce
it
as
completely
as
herself
who
had
exhausted
what
it
has
to
give
and
was
weary
of
it
she
thought
they
could
live
contentedly
in
their
closets
without
considering
that
she
had
neglected
to
furnish
their
minds
with
that
knowledge
which
may
make
the
closet
a
place
of
enjoyment
by
supplying
the
intervals
of
devotional
with
entertaining
reading
we
carried
lucilla
and
ph
oe
be
to
visit
them
i
believe
she
was
a
little
afraid
of
their
gay
countenances
i
talked
to
her
of
the
necessity
of
literature
to
inform
her
daughters
and
of
pleasures
to
enliven
them
the
term
pleasure
alarmed
her
still
more
than
that
of
literature
pleasures
were
allowed
to
religious
people
she
would
make
her
daughters
as
happy
as
she
dared
without
offending
her
maker
i
quoted
the
devout
but
liberal
hooker
who
exhorts
us
not
to
regard
the
almighty
as
a
captious
sophist
but
as
a
merciful
father
during
this
conversation
we
were
sitting
under
the
fine
spreading
oak
on
my
lawn
in
front
of
that
rich
bank
of
flowers
which
you
so
much
admire
it
was
a
lovely
evening
in
the
end
of
june
the
setting
sun
was
all
mild
radiance
the
sky
all
azure
the
air
all
fragrance
the
birds
were
in
full
song
the
children
sitting
on
the
grass
before
us
were
weaving
chaplets
of
wild
flowers
it
looked
like
nature
in
the
world
first
spring
my
heart
was
touched
with
joy
and
gratitude
madam
said
i
the
bountiful
provision
which
a
beneficent
father
makes
not
only
for
the
necessities
but
for
the
pleasures
of
his
children
not
content
with
every
food
of
life
to
nourish
man
he
makes
all
nature
beauty
to
his
eye
and
music
to
his
ear
flowers
are
of
so
little
apparent
use
that
it
might
be
thought
profuseness
in
any
economy
short
of
that
which
is
divine
to
gratify
us
at
once
with
such
forms
and
such
hues
and
such
fragrance
it
is
a
gratification
not
necessary
yet
exquisite
which
lies
somewhere
between
the
pleasure
of
sense
and
intellect
and
in
a
measure
partakes
of
both
it
elevates
while
it
exhilarates
and
lifts
the
soul
from
the
gift
to
the
giver
god
has
not
left
his
goodness
to
be
from
abstract
speculation
from
the
conclusions
of
reason
from
deduction
and
argument
we
not
only
collect
it
from
observation
but
have
palpable
evidences
of
his
bounty
we
feel
it
with
our
senses
were
god
a
hard
master
might
he
not
withhold
these
superfluities
of
goodness
do
you
think
he
makes
such
rich
provision
for
us
that
we
should
shut
our
eyes
and
close
our
ears
to
them
does
he
present
such
gifts
with
one
hand
and
hold
in
the
other
a
stern
interdict
of
not
taste
not
handle
not
and
can
you
believe
he
is
less
munificent
in
the
economy
of
grace
than
in
that
of
nature
do
you
imagine
that
he
provides
such
abundant
supplies
for
our
appetites
and
senses
here
without
providing
more
substantial
pleasures
for
our
future
enjoyment
is
not
what
we
see
a
prelude
to
what
we
hope
for
a
pledge
of
what
we
may
expect
a
specimen
of
larger
higher
richer
bounty
an
encouraging
cluster
from
the
land
of
promise
if
from
his
works
we
turn
to
his
word
we
shall
find
the
same
inexhaustible
goodness
exercised
to
still
nobler
purposes
must
we
not
hope
then
even
by
analogy
that
he
has
in
store
blessings
exalted
in
their
nature
and
eternal
in
their
duration
for
all
those
who
love
and
serve
him
in
the
gospel
of
his
son
we
now
got
on
fast
she
was
delighted
with
my
wife
and
grew
less
and
less
afraid
of
my
girls
i
believe
however
that
we
should
have
made
a
quicker
progress
in
gaining
her
confidence
if
we
had
looked
less
happy
i
suggested
to
her
to
endeavor
to
raise
the
tone
of
her
piety
to
make
their
habits
less
monastic
their
tempers
more
cheerful
their
virtues
more
active
to
render
their
lives
more
useful
by
making
them
the
immediate
instruments
of
her
charity
to
take
them
out
of
themselves
and
teach
them
to
compare
their
fictitious
distresses
with
real
substantial
misery
and
to
make
them
feel
grateful
for
the
power
and
the
privilege
of
relieving
it
as
barlow
has
two
parishes
which
join
and
we
had
the
ground
in
our
own
i
advised
them
to
found
a
school
in
the
next
for
the
instruction
of
the
young
and
a
friendly
society
for
the
aged
of
their
own
sex
we
prevailed
on
them
to
be
themselves
not
the
nominal
but
the
active
patronesses
to
take
the
measure
of
all
the
wants
and
all
the
merit
of
their
immediate
neighborhood
to
do
every
thing
under
the
advice
and
superintendence
of
barlow
and
to
make
him
their
philosopher
and
friend
by
adopting
this
plan
they
now
see
the
poverty
of
which
they
only
used
to
hear
and
know
personally
the
dependants
whom
they
protect
barlow
took
infinite
pains
to
correct
lady
aston
views
of
religion
your
notions
of
god
said
he
founded
not
on
your
own
gloomy
apprehensions
and
visionary
imaginations
but
on
what
is
revealed
in
his
word
else
the
very
intenseness
of
your
feelings
the
very
sincerity
of
your
devotion
may
betray
you
into
enthusiasm
into
error
into
superstition
into
despair
spiritual
notions
which
are
not
grounded
on
scriptural
truth
and
directed
and
guarded
by
a
close
adherence
to
it
mislead
tender
hearts
and
warm
imaginations
but
while
you
rest
on
the
sure
unperverted
foundation
of
the
word
of
god
and
pray
for
his
spirit
to
assist
you
in
the
use
of
his
word
you
will
have
little
cause
to
dread
that
you
shall
fear
him
too
much
or
serve
him
too
well
i
earnestly
exhort
you
continued
he
to
take
the
measure
of
your
spiritual
state
from
circumstances
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
be
not
dismayed
at
an
incidental
depression
which
may
depend
on
the
state
of
your
health
or
your
spirits
or
your
affairs
look
not
for
sensible
communications
do
not
consider
rapturous
feelings
as
any
criterion
of
the
favor
of
your
maker
nor
the
absence
of
them
as
any
indication
of
his
displeasure
an
increasing
desire
to
know
him
more
and
serve
him
better
an
increasing
desire
to
do
and
to
suffer
his
whole
will
a
growing
resignation
to
his
providential
dispensations
is
a
much
surer
a
much
more
unequivocal
test
i
next
continued
stanley
carried
our
worthy
curate
jackson
to
visit
her
and
proposed
that
she
should
engage
him
to
spend
a
few
hours
every
week
with
the
young
ladies
i
recommended
that
after
he
had
read
with
them
a
portion
of
scripture
of
which
he
would
give
them
a
sound
and
plain
exposition
he
should
convince
them
he
had
not
the
worse
taste
for
being
religious
by
reading
with
them
some
books
of
general
instruction
history
travels
and
polite
literature
this
would
imbue
their
minds
with
useful
knowledge
form
their
taste
and
fill
up
profitably
and
pleasantly
that
time
which
now
lay
heavy
on
their
hands
and
without
intrenching
on
any
of
their
duties
would
qualify
them
to
discharge
them
more
cheerfully
i
next
suggested
that
they
should
study
gardening
and
that
they
should
put
themselves
under
the
tuition
of
lucilla
who
is
become
the
little
repton
of
the
valley
to
add
to
the
interest
i
requested
that
a
fresh
piece
of
ground
might
be
given
them
that
they
might
not
only
exercise
their
taste
but
be
animated
with
seeing
the
complete
effect
of
their
own
exertions
as
a
creation
of
their
own
would
be
likely
to
afford
them
more
amusement
than
improving
on
the
labors
of
another
i
had
soon
the
gratification
of
seeing
my
little
carmelites
who
used
when
they
walked
in
the
garden
to
look
as
if
they
came
to
dig
a
daily
portion
of
their
own
graves
now
enjoying
it
embellishing
it
and
delighted
by
watching
its
progress
and
their
excellent
mother
who
like
spenser
despair
used
to
look
if
she
never
dined
now
enjoying
the
company
of
her
select
friends
the
mother
is
become
almost
cheerful
and
the
daughters
almost
gay
their
dormant
faculties
are
awakened
time
is
no
longer
a
burden
but
a
blessing
the
day
is
too
short
for
their
duties
which
are
performed
with
alacrity
since
they
have
been
converted
into
pleasures
you
will
believe
i
did
not
hazard
all
these
terrible
innovations
as
rapidly
as
i
recount
them
but
gradually
as
they
were
able
to
bear
it
this
happy
change
in
themselves
has
had
the
happiest
consequences
their
friends
had
conceived
the
strongest
prejudices
against
religion
from
the
gloomy
garb
in
which
they
had
seen
it
arrayed
at
aston
hall
the
uncle
who
was
also
the
guardian
had
threatened
to
remove
the
girls
before
they
were
quite
moped
to
death
the
young
baronet
was
actually
forbidden
to
come
home
at
the
holidays
but
now
the
uncle
is
quite
reconciled
to
them
and
almost
to
he
has
resumed
his
fondness
for
the
daughters
and
their
brother
a
fine
youth
at
cambridge
is
happy
in
spending
his
vacations
with
his
family
to
whom
he
is
become
tenderly
attached
he
has
had
his
own
principles
and
character
much
raised
by
the
conversation
and
example
of
barlow
who
contrives
to
be
at
aston
hall
as
much
as
possible
when
sir
george
is
there
he
is
daily
expected
to
make
his
mother
a
visit
when
i
shall
recommend
him
to
your
particular
notice
and
acquaintance
lucilla
blushing
said
she
thought
her
father
had
too
exclusively
recommended
the
to
my
friendship
she
would
venture
to
say
the
were
equally
worthy
of
my
regard
adding
in
an
affectionate
tone
they
are
every
thing
that
is
amiable
and
kind
the
more
you
know
them
sir
the
more
you
will
admire
them
for
their
good
qualities
are
kept
back
by
the
best
quality
of
all
their
modesty
this
candid
and
liberal
praise
did
not
sink
the
fair
eulogist
herself
in
my
esteem
chapter
xvii
i
had
now
been
near
three
weeks
at
the
grove
ever
since
my
arrival
i
had
contracted
the
habit
of
pouring
out
my
heart
to
and
stanley
with
grateful
affection
and
filial
confidence
i
still
continued
to
do
so
on
all
subjects
except
one
the
more
i
saw
of
lucilla
the
more
difficult
i
found
it
to
resist
her
numberless
attractions
i
could
not
persuade
myself
that
either
prudence
or
duty
demanded
that
i
should
guard
my
heart
against
such
a
combination
of
amiable
virtues
and
gentle
graces
virtues
and
graces
which
as
i
before
observed
my
mind
had
long
been
combining
as
a
delightful
idea
and
which
i
now
saw
realized
in
a
form
more
engaging
than
even
my
own
imagination
had
allowed
itself
to
picture
i
did
not
feel
courage
sufficient
to
risk
the
happiness
i
actually
enjoyed
by
aspiring
too
suddenly
to
a
happiness
more
perfect
i
dared
not
yet
avow
to
the
parents
or
the
daughter
feelings
which
my
fears
told
me
might
possibly
be
discouraged
and
which
if
discouraged
would
at
once
dash
to
the
ground
a
fabric
of
felicity
that
my
heart
not
my
fancy
had
erected
and
which
my
taste
my
judgment
and
my
principles
equally
approved
and
delighted
to
contemplate
the
great
critic
of
antiquity
in
his
treatise
on
the
drama
observes
that
the
introduction
of
a
new
person
is
of
the
next
importance
to
a
new
incident
whether
the
introduction
of
two
interlocutors
is
equal
in
importance
to
two
incidents
aristotle
has
forgotten
to
establish
this
dramatic
rule
was
illustrated
by
the
arrival
of
sir
john
and
lady
belfield
who
though
not
new
to
the
reader
or
the
writer
were
new
at
stanley
grove
the
early
friendship
of
the
two
gentlemen
had
suffered
little
diminution
from
absence
though
their
intercourse
had
been
much
interrupted
sir
john
who
was
a
few
years
younger
than
his
friend
since
his
marriage
having
lived
as
entirely
in
town
as
stanley
had
done
in
the
country
stanley
had
indeed
seen
lady
belfield
a
few
times
in
but
her
ladyship
had
never
before
been
introduced
to
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
grove
the
guests
were
received
with
cordial
affection
and
easily
fell
into
the
family
habits
which
they
did
not
wish
to
interrupt
but
from
the
observation
of
which
they
hoped
to
improve
their
own
they
were
charmed
with
the
interesting
variety
of
characters
in
the
lovely
young
family
who
in
return
were
delighted
with
the
politeness
kindness
and
cheerfulness
of
their
father
guests
shall
i
avow
my
own
meanness
cordially
as
i
loved
the
belfields
i
am
afraid
i
saw
them
arrive
with
a
slight
tincture
of
jealousy
they
would
i
thought
by
enlarging
the
family
circle
throw
me
at
a
further
distance
from
the
being
whom
i
wished
to
contemplate
nearly
they
would
by
dividing
her
attention
diminish
my
proportion
i
had
been
hitherto
the
sole
guest
i
was
now
to
be
one
of
several
this
was
the
first
discovery
i
made
that
love
is
a
narrower
of
the
heart
i
tried
to
subdue
the
ungenerous
feeling
and
to
meet
my
valuable
friends
with
a
warmth
adequate
to
that
which
they
so
kindly
manifested
i
found
that
a
wrong
feeling
at
which
one
has
virtue
enough
left
to
blush
is
seldom
lasting
and
shame
soon
expelled
it
the
first
day
was
passed
in
mutual
inquiries
and
mutual
communications
lady
belfield
told
me
that
the
amiable
fanny
after
having
wept
over
the
grave
of
her
mother
was
removed
to
the
house
of
the
benevolent
clergyman
who
had
kindly
promised
her
an
asylum
till
lady
return
to
town
when
it
was
intended
she
should
be
received
into
her
family
that
worthy
man
and
his
wife
having
taken
on
themselves
a
full
responsibility
for
her
character
and
disposition
and
generously
promised
that
they
would
exert
themselves
to
advance
her
progress
in
knowledge
during
the
interval
lady
belfield
added
that
every
inquiry
respecting
fanny
whom
we
must
now
call
miss
stokes
had
been
attended
with
the
most
satisfactory
result
her
principles
being
as
unquestionable
as
her
talents
after
dinner
i
observed
that
whenever
the
door
opened
lady
eye
was
always
turned
toward
it
in
expectation
of
seeing
the
children
her
affectionate
heart
felt
disappointed
on
finding
that
they
did
not
appear
and
she
could
not
forbear
whispering
to
me
who
sat
next
her
that
she
was
afraid
the
piety
of
our
good
friends
was
a
little
tinctured
with
severity
for
her
part
she
saw
no
reason
why
religion
should
diminish
one
affection
for
one
children
and
rob
them
of
their
innocent
pleasures
i
assured
her
gravely
i
thought
so
too
but
forbore
telling
her
how
totally
inapposite
her
application
was
to
and
stanley
she
seemed
glad
to
find
me
of
her
opinion
and
gave
up
all
hope
of
seeing
the
little
melancholy
recluses
as
she
called
them
unless
she
said
laughing
she
might
be
permitted
to
look
at
them
through
the
grate
of
their
cells
i
smiled
but
did
not
undeceive
her
and
affected
to
join
in
her
compassion
when
we
went
to
attend
the
ladies
in
the
i
was
delighted
to
find
lady
belfield
sitting
on
a
low
stool
the
whole
gay
group
at
play
around
her
a
blush
mixed
itself
with
her
smile
as
we
interchanged
a
significant
look
she
was
questioning
one
of
the
elder
ones
while
the
youngest
sat
on
her
lap
singing
sir
john
entered
with
that
kindness
and
good
humor
so
natural
to
him
into
the
sports
of
the
others
who
though
wild
with
health
and
spirits
were
always
gentle
and
docile
he
had
a
thousand
pleasant
things
to
entertain
them
with
he
too
it
seems
had
not
been
without
his
misgivings
are
not
these
poor
miserable
recluses
whispered
i
maliciously
to
her
ladyship
and
are
not
these
rueful
looks
proof
positive
that
religion
diminishes
our
affection
for
our
children
and
is
it
not
abridging
their
innocent
pleasures
to
give
them
their
full
range
in
a
fresh
airy
apartment
instead
of
cramming
them
into
an
of
which
the
air
is
made
almost
fetid
by
the
fumes
of
the
dinner
and
a
crowded
table
and
is
it
not
better
that
they
should
spoil
the
pleasure
of
the
company
though
the
mischief
they
do
is
bought
by
the
sacrifice
of
their
own
liberty
i
make
my
said
she
i
never
will
be
so
forward
again
to
suspect
piety
of
ill
nature
so
far
from
it
caroline
said
sir
john
that
we
will
adopt
the
practice
we
were
so
forward
to
blame
and
i
shall
not
do
it
said
he
more
from
regard
to
the
company
than
to
the
children
who
i
am
sure
will
be
gainers
in
point
of
enjoyment
liberty
i
perceive
is
to
them
positive
pleasure
and
paramount
to
any
which
our
false
epicurism
can
contrive
for
them
well
charles
said
sir
john
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
alone
now
tell
us
about
this
lucilla
this
paragon
this
nonpareil
of
barlow
tell
me
what
is
she
or
rather
what
is
she
not
first
replied
i
i
will
as
you
desire
define
her
by
negatives
she
is
a
professed
beauty
she
is
a
professed
genius
she
is
a
professed
philosopher
she
is
a
professed
wit
she
is
a
professed
any
thing
and
i
thank
my
stars
she
is
an
artist
bravo
charles
now
as
to
what
she
is
she
is
replied
i
from
nature
a
woman
gentle
feeling
animated
modest
she
is
by
education
elegant
informed
enlightened
she
is
from
religion
pious
humble
candid
charitable
what
a
refreshment
will
it
be
said
sir
john
to
see
a
girl
of
fine
sense
more
cultivated
than
accomplished
the
creature
not
of
fiddlers
and
but
of
nature
of
books
and
of
good
company
if
there
is
the
same
mixture
of
spirit
and
delicacy
in
her
character
that
there
is
of
softness
and
animation
in
her
countenance
she
is
a
dangerous
girl
charles
she
certainly
does
said
i
possess
the
essential
charm
of
beauty
where
it
exists
and
the
most
effectual
substitute
for
it
where
it
does
not
the
power
of
prepossessing
the
beholder
by
her
look
and
manner
in
favor
of
her
understanding
and
temper
this
prepossession
i
afterward
found
confirmed
not
only
by
her
own
share
in
the
conversation
but
by
its
effect
on
myself
i
always
feel
that
our
intercourse
unfolds
not
only
her
powers
but
my
own
in
conversing
with
such
a
woman
i
am
apt
to
fancy
that
i
have
more
understanding
because
her
animating
presence
brings
it
more
into
exercise
after
breakfast
next
day
the
conversation
happened
to
turn
on
the
indispensable
importance
of
unbounded
confidence
to
the
happiness
of
married
persons
stanley
expressed
his
regret
that
though
it
was
one
of
the
grand
ingredients
of
domestic
comfort
yet
it
was
sometimes
unavoidably
prevented
by
an
unhappy
inequality
of
mind
between
the
parties
by
violence
or
imprudence
or
imbecility
on
one
side
which
almost
compelled
the
other
to
a
degree
of
reserve
as
incompatible
with
the
design
of
the
union
as
with
the
frankness
of
the
individual
we
have
had
an
instance
among
our
own
friends
replied
sir
john
of
this
evil
being
produced
not
by
any
of
the
faults
to
which
you
have
adverted
but
by
an
excess
of
misapplied
sensibility
in
two
persons
of
near
equality
as
to
merit
and
in
both
of
whom
the
utmost
purity
of
mind
and
exactness
of
conduct
rendered
all
concealment
superfluous
our
worthy
friends
and
hamilton
married
from
motives
of
affection
and
with
a
high
opinion
of
each
other
merit
which
their
long
and
intimate
connection
has
rather
contributed
to
exalt
than
to
lower
and
yet
now
at
the
end
of
seven
years
they
are
only
beginning
to
be
happy
they
contrived
to
make
each
other
and
themselves
as
uncomfortable
by
an
excess
of
tenderness
as
some
married
pairs
are
rendered
by
the
want
of
it
a
mistaken
sensibility
has
intrenched
not
only
on
their
comfort
but
on
their
sincerity
their
resolution
never
to
give
each
other
pain
has
led
them
to
live
in
a
constant
state
of
petty
concealment
they
are
neither
of
them
remarkably
healthy
and
to
hide
from
each
other
every
little
indisposition
have
kept
up
a
continual
vigilance
to
conceal
illness
on
the
one
part
and
to
detect
it
on
the
other
till
it
became
a
trial
of
skill
which
could
make
the
other
most
unhappy
each
suffering
much
more
by
suspicion
when
there
was
no
occasion
for
it
than
they
could
have
done
by
the
acknowledgment
of
slight
complaints
when
they
actually
existed
this
valuable
pair
after
seven
years
apprenticeship
to
a
petty
martyrdom
have
at
last
found
out
that
it
is
better
to
submit
to
the
inevitable
ills
of
life
cheerfully
and
in
concert
and
to
comfort
each
other
under
them
cordially
than
alternately
to
suffer
and
inflict
the
pain
of
perpetual
disingenuousness
they
have
at
last
discovered
that
uninterrupted
prosperity
is
not
the
lot
of
man
each
is
happier
now
with
knowing
that
the
other
is
sometimes
sick
than
they
used
to
be
with
suspecting
they
were
always
so
the
physician
is
now
no
longer
secretly
sent
for
to
one
when
the
other
is
known
to
be
from
home
the
apothecary
is
at
last
allowed
to
walk
boldly
up
the
public
staircase
fearless
of
detection
these
amiable
persons
have
at
length
attained
all
that
was
wanting
to
their
felicity
that
of
each
believing
the
other
to
be
well
when
they
they
are
so
they
have
found
out
that
unreserved
communication
is
the
lawful
commerce
of
conjugal
affection
and
that
all
concealment
is
contraband
surely
said
i
when
sir
john
had
done
speaking
it
is
a
false
compliment
to
the
objects
of
our
affection
if
for
the
sake
of
sparing
them
a
transient
uneasiness
we
rob
them
of
the
comfort
to
which
they
are
entitled
of
mitigating
our
sufferings
by
partaking
it
all
dissimulation
is
disloyal
to
love
besides
it
appears
to
me
to
be
an
introduction
to
wider
evils
and
i
should
fear
both
for
the
woman
i
loved
and
for
myself
that
if
once
we
allowed
ourselves
concealment
in
one
point
where
we
thought
the
motive
excused
us
we
might
learn
to
adopt
it
in
others
where
the
principle
was
more
evidently
wrong
besides
replied
stanley
it
argues
a
lamentable
ignorance
of
human
life
to
set
out
with
an
expectation
of
health
without
interruption
and
of
happiness
without
alloy
when
young
persons
marry
with
the
fairest
prospects
they
should
never
forget
that
infirmity
is
inseparably
bound
up
with
their
very
nature
and
that
in
bearing
one
another
burdens
they
fulfill
one
of
the
highest
duties
of
the
union
chapter
xviii
after
supper
when
only
the
family
party
were
present
the
conversation
turned
on
the
unhappy
effects
of
misguided
passion
stanley
lamented
that
novels
with
a
very
few
admirable
exceptions
had
done
infinite
mischief
by
so
completely
establishing
the
omnipotence
of
love
that
the
young
reader
was
almost
systematically
taught
an
unresisting
submission
to
a
feeling
because
the
feeling
was
commonly
represented
as
irresistible
young
ladies
said
sir
john
smiling
in
their
blind
submission
to
this
imaginary
omnipotence
are
apt
to
be
necessarians
when
they
in
love
as
it
is
so
justly
called
they
then
obey
their
but
in
their
stout
opposition
to
prudence
and
duty
they
most
manfully
exert
their
so
that
they
want
nothing
but
of
the
miseries
attendant
on
an
indiscreet
attachment
completely
to
exemplify
the
occupation
assigned
by
milton
to
a
class
of
beings
to
whom
it
would
not
be
gallant
to
resemble
young
ladies
stanley
continued
to
assert
that
affection
only
became
invincible
because
its
supposed
invincibility
had
been
first
erected
into
a
principle
she
then
adverted
to
the
power
of
religion
in
subduing
the
passions
that
of
love
among
the
rest
i
ventured
to
ask
lucilla
who
was
sitting
next
me
a
happiness
which
by
some
means
or
other
i
generally
contrived
to
enjoy
what
were
her
sentiments
on
this
point
with
a
little
confusion
she
said
to
conquer
an
ill
placed
attachment
i
conceive
may
be
effected
by
motives
inferior
to
religion
reason
the
humbling
conviction
of
having
made
an
unworthy
choice
for
i
will
not
resort
to
so
bad
a
motive
as
pride
may
easily
accomplish
it
but
to
conquer
a
affection
a
justifiable
attachment
i
should
imagine
requires
the
powerful
principle
of
christian
piety
and
what
can
not
that
effect
she
stopped
and
blushed
as
fearing
she
had
said
too
much
lady
belfield
observed
that
she
believed
a
virtuous
attachment
might
possibly
be
subdued
by
the
principle
miss
stanley
had
mentioned
yet
she
doubted
if
it
were
in
the
power
of
religion
itself
to
enable
the
heart
to
conquer
aversion
much
less
to
establish
affection
for
an
object
for
whom
dislike
had
been
entertained
i
believe
said
stanley
the
example
is
rare
and
the
exertion
difficult
but
that
which
is
difficult
to
us
is
not
impossible
to
him
who
has
the
hearts
of
all
men
in
his
hand
and
i
am
happy
to
resolve
lady
belfield
doubt
by
a
case
in
point
you
can
not
sir
john
have
forgotten
our
old
london
acquaintance
carlton
no
replied
he
nor
can
i
ever
forget
what
i
have
since
heard
of
his
ungenerous
treatment
of
that
most
amiable
woman
his
wife
i
suppose
he
has
long
ago
broken
her
heart
you
know
resumed
stanley
they
married
not
only
without
any
inclination
on
either
side
but
on
her
part
with
something
more
than
indifference
with
a
preference
for
another
person
married
through
an
implicit
obedience
to
her
mother
will
which
she
had
never
in
any
instance
opposed
because
his
father
had
threatened
to
disinherit
him
if
he
married
any
other
woman
for
as
they
were
distant
relations
there
was
no
other
way
of
securing
the
estate
in
the
family
what
a
motive
for
a
union
so
sacred
and
so
indissoluble
exclaimed
i
with
an
ardor
which
raised
a
smile
in
the
whole
party
i
asked
pardon
for
my
involuntary
interruption
and
stanley
proceeded
she
had
long
entertained
a
partiality
for
a
most
deserving
young
clergyman
much
her
inferior
in
rank
and
fortune
but
though
her
high
sense
of
filial
duty
led
her
to
sacrifice
this
innocent
inclination
and
though
she
resolved
never
to
see
him
again
and
had
even
prevailed
on
him
to
quit
the
country
and
settle
in
a
distant
place
yet
carlton
was
ungenerous
and
inconsistent
enough
to
be
jealous
of
her
without
loving
her
he
was
guilty
of
great
irregularities
while
carlton
set
about
acquitting
herself
of
the
duties
of
a
wife
with
the
most
meek
and
humble
patience
burying
her
sorrows
in
her
own
bosom
and
not
allowing
herself
even
the
consolation
of
complaining
among
the
many
reasons
for
his
dislike
her
piety
was
the
principal
he
said
religion
was
of
no
use
but
to
disqualify
people
for
the
business
of
life
that
it
taught
them
to
make
a
merit
of
despising
their
duties
and
hating
their
relations
and
that
pride
opposition
and
contempt
for
the
rest
of
the
world
were
the
meat
and
drink
of
all
those
who
pretended
to
religion
at
first
she
nearly
sunk
under
his
unkindness
her
health
declined
and
her
spirits
failed
in
this
distress
she
applied
to
the
only
sure
refuge
for
the
unhappy
and
took
comfort
in
the
consideration
that
her
trials
were
appointed
by
a
merciful
father
to
detach
her
from
a
world
which
she
might
have
loved
too
fondly
had
it
not
been
thus
stripped
of
its
delights
when
stanley
who
was
her
confidential
friend
expressed
the
tenderest
sympathy
in
her
sufferings
she
meekly
replied
who
are
they
whose
robes
are
washed
white
in
the
kingdom
of
glory
is
they
who
come
out
of
great
i
endeavor
to
strengthen
my
faith
with
a
view
of
what
the
best
christians
have
suffered
and
my
hope
with
meditating
on
the
shortness
of
all
suffering
i
will
confess
my
weakness
added
she
the
various
motives
to
patience
under
the
ills
of
life
which
the
bible
presents
though
my
reason
and
religion
acknowledge
them
all
there
is
not
one
which
comes
home
so
powerfully
to
my
feelings
as
this
time
is
another
time
stanley
who
had
heard
of
some
recent
irregularities
of
carlton
called
upon
her
and
lamenting
the
solitude
to
which
she
was
often
left
for
days
together
advised
her
to
have
a
female
friend
in
the
house
that
her
mind
might
not
be
left
to
prey
upon
itself
by
living
so
much
alone
she
thanked
her
for
the
kind
suggestion
but
said
she
felt
it
was
wiser
and
better
not
to
have
a
confidential
friend
always
at
hand
of
what
subject
should
we
talk
said
she
of
my
husband
faults
ought
i
to
allow
myself
in
such
a
practice
it
would
lead
me
to
indulge
a
habit
of
complaint
which
i
am
laboring
to
subdue
the
compassion
of
my
friend
would
only
sharpen
my
feelings
which
i
wish
to
blunt
giving
vent
to
a
flame
only
makes
it
rage
the
more
if
suppressing
can
not
subdue
it
at
least
the
consciousness
that
i
am
doing
my
duty
will
enable
me
to
support
it
when
we
feel
added
she
we
are
wrong
the
opening
our
heart
may
strengthen
our
virtue
but
when
we
are
wrong
the
mind
demands
another
sort
of
strength
it
wants
higher
support
than
friendship
has
to
impart
it
pours
out
its
sorrows
in
prayer
with
fuller
confidence
knowing
that
he
who
sees
can
sustain
that
he
who
hears
will
recompense
that
he
will
judge
not
our
weakness
but
our
efforts
to
conquer
it
not
our
success
but
our
endeavors
with
him
endeavor
is
victory
grace
i
most
want
added
she
humility
a
partial
friend
in
order
to
support
my
spirits
would
flatter
my
conduct
gratified
with
her
soothing
i
should
perhaps
not
so
entirely
cast
myself
for
comfort
on
god
contented
with
human
praise
i
might
rest
in
it
besides
having
endured
the
smart
i
would
not
willingly
endure
it
in
vain
we
know
who
has
said
you
suffer
with
me
you
shall
also
reign
with
me
it
is
not
however
to
mere
suffering
that
the
promise
is
addressed
but
to
suffering
for
his
sake
and
in
his
spirit
then
turning
to
the
bible
which
lay
before
her
and
pointing
to
the
sublime
passage
of
st
paul
which
she
had
just
been
reading
light
affliction
which
is
but
for
a
moment
worketh
for
us
a
far
more
exceeding
and
eternal
weight
of
glory
said
she
this
in
connection
with
the
next
verse
which
is
not
always
done
is
it
that
it
works
for
us
this
weight
of
glory
we
are
looking
at
the
things
which
are
not
seen
do
admire
the
beauty
of
this
position
and
how
the
good
is
weighed
against
the
evil
like
two
scales
differently
filled
the
affliction
is
light
and
but
for
a
moment
the
glory
is
a
and
it
is
is
a
feather
against
lead
a
grain
of
sand
against
the
universe
a
moment
against
eternity
oh
how
the
scale
which
contains
this
world
light
trouble
kicks
the
beam
when
weighed
against
the
glory
which
shall
be
revealed
at
the
end
of
two
years
she
had
a
little
girl
this
opened
to
her
a
new
scene
of
duties
and
a
fresh
source
of
consolation
her
religion
proved
itself
to
be
of
the
right
stamp
by
making
her
temper
still
more
sweet
and
diffusing
the
happiest
effects
through
her
whole
character
and
conversation
when
her
husband
had
staid
out
late
or
even
all
night
she
never
reproached
him
when
he
was
at
home
she
received
his
friends
with
as
much
civility
as
if
she
had
liked
them
he
found
that
his
house
was
conducted
with
the
utmost
prudence
and
that
while
she
maintained
his
credit
at
his
table
her
personal
expenses
were
almost
nothing
indeed
self
seemed
nearly
annihilated
in
her
he
sometimes
felt
disappointed
because
he
had
no
cause
of
complaint
and
was
angry
that
he
had
nothing
to
condemn
as
he
has
a
very
fine
understanding
he
was
the
more
provoked
because
he
could
not
help
seeing
that
her
blameless
conduct
put
him
continually
in
the
wrong
all
this
puzzled
him
he
never
suspected
there
was
a
principle
out
of
which
such
consequences
could
grow
and
was
ready
to
attribute
to
insensibility
that
patience
which
nothing
short
of
christian
piety
could
have
inspired
he
had
conceived
of
religion
as
a
visionary
system
of
words
and
phrases
and
concluded
that
from
so
unsubstantial
a
theory
it
would
be
a
folly
to
look
for
practical
effects
sometimes
when
he
saw
her
nursing
his
child
of
whom
he
was
very
fond
he
was
almost
tempted
to
admire
the
mother
who
is
a
most
pleasing
figure
and
now
and
then
when
his
heart
was
thus
softened
for
a
moment
he
would
ask
himself
what
reasonable
ground
of
objection
there
was
either
to
her
mind
or
person
carlton
knowing
that
his
affairs
must
necessarily
be
embarrassed
by
the
extraordinary
expenses
he
had
incurred
when
the
steward
brought
her
usual
year
allowance
she
refused
to
take
more
than
half
and
ordered
him
to
employ
the
remainder
on
his
master
account
the
faithful
old
man
was
ready
to
weep
and
could
not
forbear
saying
you
could
not
do
more
for
a
kind
husband
besides
it
is
but
a
drop
of
water
in
the
ocean
drop
said
she
is
my
duty
to
contribute
when
the
steward
communicated
this
to
carlton
he
was
deeply
affected
refused
to
take
the
money
and
again
was
driven
to
resort
to
the
wonderful
principle
from
which
such
right
but
difficult
actions
could
proceed
here
i
interrupted
stanley
i
am
quite
of
the
steward
opinion
said
i
that
a
woman
should
do
this
and
much
more
for
the
man
who
loved
her
and
whom
she
loved
is
quite
intelligible
to
every
being
who
has
a
heart
but
for
a
cruel
unfeeling
tyrant
i
do
not
comprehend
it
what
say
you
miss
stanley
under
the
circumstance
you
suppose
said
she
blushing
i
think
the
woman
would
have
no
shadow
of
merit
her
conduct
would
be
a
mere
gratification
an
entire
indulgence
of
her
own
feelings
the
triumph
of
affection
would
have
been
cheap
carlton
was
the
triumph
of
religion
of
a
principle
which
could
subdue
an
attachment
to
a
worthy
object
and
act
with
such
generosity
toward
an
unworthy
one
stanley
went
on
carlton
frequently
sat
up
late
reading
such
books
as
might
qualify
her
for
the
education
of
her
child
but
always
retired
before
she
had
reason
to
expect
carlton
lest
he
might
construe
it
into
upbraiding
one
night
as
he
was
not
expected
to
come
home
at
all
she
sat
later
than
usual
and
had
indulged
herself
with
taking
her
child
to
pass
the
night
in
her
bed
with
her
usual
earnestness
she
knelt
down
and
offered
up
her
devotions
by
her
and
in
a
manner
particularly
solemn
and
affecting
prayed
for
her
husband
her
heart
was
deeply
touched
and
she
dwelt
on
these
petitions
in
a
strain
peculiarly
fervent
she
prayed
for
his
welfare
in
both
worlds
and
earnestly
implored
that
she
might
be
made
the
humble
instrument
of
his
happiness
she
meekly
acknowledged
her
own
many
offenses
of
his
she
said
nothing
thinking
herself
secure
from
interruption
her
petitions
were
uttered
aloud
her
voice
often
faltering
and
her
eyes
streaming
with
tears
little
did
she
suspect
that
the
object
of
her
prayers
was
within
hearing
of
them
he
had
returned
home
unexpectedly
and
coming
softly
into
the
room
heard
her
pious
aspirations
he
was
inexpressibly
affected
he
wept
and
sighed
bitterly
the
light
from
the
candles
on
the
table
fell
on
the
blooming
face
of
his
sleeping
infant
and
on
that
of
his
weeping
wife
it
was
too
much
for
him
but
he
had
not
the
virtuous
courage
to
give
way
to
his
feelings
he
had
not
the
generosity
to
come
forward
and
express
the
admiration
he
felt
he
withdrew
unperceived
and
passed
the
remainder
of
the
night
in
great
perturbation
of
spirit
shame
remorse
and
confusion
raised
such
a
conflict
in
his
mind
as
prevented
him
from
closing
his
eyes
while
she
slept
in
quiet
and
awoke
in
peace
the
next
morning
during
a
very
short
interview
he
behaved
to
her
with
a
kindness
which
she
had
never
before
experienced
he
had
not
resolution
to
breakfast
with
her
but
promised
with
affection
in
his
words
and
manners
to
return
to
dinner
the
truth
was
he
never
quitted
home
but
wandered
about
his
woods
to
compose
and
strengthen
his
mind
this
was
the
first
he
had
practiced
its
effects
were
salutary
a
day
or
two
previous
to
this
they
had
dined
at
our
house
he
had
always
been
much
addicted
to
the
pleasures
of
the
table
he
expressed
high
approbation
of
a
particular
dish
and
mentioned
again
when
he
got
home
how
much
he
liked
it
the
next
morning
carlton
wrote
to
lucilla
to
beg
the
receipt
for
making
this
ragout
and
this
day
when
he
returned
from
his
solitary
ramble
and
visitings
the
favorite
dish
most
exquisitely
dressed
was
produced
at
his
dinner
he
thanked
her
for
this
obliging
attention
and
turning
to
the
butler
directed
him
to
tell
the
cook
that
no
dish
was
ever
so
well
dressed
carlton
blushed
when
the
honest
butler
said
it
was
my
mistress
dressed
it
with
her
own
hands
because
she
knew
your
honor
was
fond
of
it
tears
of
gratitude
rushed
into
carlton
eyes
and
tears
of
joy
overflowed
those
of
the
old
domestic
when
his
master
rising
from
the
table
tenderly
embraced
his
wife
and
declared
he
was
unworthy
of
such
a
treasure
have
been
guilty
of
a
public
wrong
johnson
said
he
to
his
servant
my
reparation
shall
be
as
public
i
can
never
deserve
her
but
my
life
shall
be
spent
in
endeavoring
to
do
so
the
little
girl
was
brought
in
and
her
presence
seemed
to
cement
this
new
formed
union
an
augmented
cheerfulness
on
the
part
of
carlton
invited
an
increased
tenderness
on
that
of
her
husband
he
began
every
day
to
discover
new
excellences
in
his
wife
which
he
readily
acknowledged
to
herself
and
to
the
world
the
conviction
of
her
worth
had
been
gradually
producing
esteem
esteem
now
ripened
into
affection
and
his
affection
for
his
wife
was
mingled
with
a
blind
sort
of
admiration
of
that
piety
which
had
produced
such
effects
he
now
began
to
think
home
the
pleasantest
place
and
his
wife
the
pleasantest
companion
a
gentle
censure
from
him
on
the
excessive
frugality
of
her
dress
mixed
with
admiration
of
the
purity
of
its
motive
was
an
intimation
to
her
to
be
more
elegant
he
happened
to
admire
a
gown
worn
by
a
lady
whom
they
had
visited
she
not
only
sent
for
the
same
materials
but
had
it
made
by
the
same
pattern
a
little
attention
of
which
he
felt
the
delicacy
he
not
only
saw
but
in
no
long
time
acknowledged
that
a
religion
which
produced
such
admirable
effects
could
not
be
so
mischievous
a
principle
as
he
had
supposed
nor
could
it
be
an
inert
principle
her
prudence
has
accomplished
what
her
piety
began
she
always
watched
the
turn
of
his
eye
to
see
how
far
she
might
venture
and
changed
the
discourse
when
the
look
was
not
encouraging
she
never
tired
him
with
lectures
never
obtruded
serious
discourse
unseasonably
nor
prolonged
it
improperly
his
early
love
of
reading
which
had
for
some
years
given
way
to
more
turbulent
pleasures
he
has
resumed
and
frequently
insists
that
the
books
he
reads
to
her
shall
be
of
her
own
choosing
in
this
choice
she
exercises
the
nicest
discretion
selecting
such
as
may
gently
lead
his
mind
to
higher
pursuits
but
which
at
the
same
time
are
so
elegantly
written
as
not
to
disgust
his
taste
in
all
this
stanley
is
her
friend
and
counselor
while
carlton
is
advancing
her
husband
relish
for
books
of
piety
he
is
forming
hers
to
polite
literature
she
herself
often
proposes
an
amusing
book
that
he
may
not
suspect
her
of
a
wish
to
abridge
his
innocent
gratifications
and
by
this
complaisance
she
gains
more
than
she
loses
for
not
to
be
outdone
in
generosity
he
often
proposes
some
pious
one
in
return
thus
their
mutual
sacrifices
are
mutual
benefits
she
has
found
out
that
he
has
a
highly
cultivated
understanding
and
he
has
discovered
that
she
has
a
mind
remarkably
susceptible
of
cultivation
he
has
by
degrees
dropped
most
of
his
former
associates
and
has
entirely
renounced
the
diversions
into
which
they
led
him
he
is
become
a
frequent
and
welcome
visitor
here
his
conduct
is
uniformly
respectable
and
i
look
forward
with
hope
to
his
becoming
even
a
shining
character
there
is
however
a
pertinacity
i
may
say
a
sincerity
in
his
temper
which
somewhat
keeps
him
back
he
will
never
adopt
any
principle
without
the
most
complete
conviction
of
his
own
mind
nor
profess
any
truth
of
which
he
himself
does
not
actually
feel
the
force
lady
belfield
after
thanking
stanley
for
his
interesting
little
narrative
earnestly
requested
that
sir
john
would
renew
his
acquaintance
with
carlton
that
she
herself
might
be
enabled
to
profit
by
such
an
affecting
example
of
the
power
of
genuine
religion
as
his
wife
exhibited
confessing
that
one
such
living
instance
would
weigh
more
with
her
than
a
hundred
arguments
stanley
obligingly
promised
to
invite
them
to
dinner
the
first
leisure
day
stanley
now
informed
us
that
sir
george
aston
was
arrived
from
cambridge
on
a
visit
to
his
mother
and
sisters
that
he
was
a
youth
of
great
promise
whom
he
begged
to
introduce
to
us
as
a
young
man
in
whose
welfare
he
took
a
lively
concern
and
on
the
right
formation
of
whose
character
much
would
depend
as
he
had
a
large
estate
and
the
family
interest
in
the
county
would
give
him
a
very
considerable
influence
to
this
influence
it
was
therefore
of
great
importance
to
give
a
right
direction
we
next
morning
took
a
ride
to
aston
hall
and
i
commenced
an
acquaintance
with
the
engaging
young
baronet
which
i
doubt
not
from
what
i
saw
and
heard
will
hereafter
ripen
into
friendship
chapter
xix
the
good
rector
joined
the
party
at
dinner
the
conversation
afterward
happened
to
turn
on
the
value
of
human
opinion
and
sir
john
belfield
made
the
hackneyed
observation
that
the
desire
of
obtaining
it
should
never
be
discouraged
it
being
highly
useful
as
a
motive
of
action
yes
said
barlow
it
certainly
has
its
uses
in
a
world
the
affairs
of
which
must
be
chiefly
carried
on
by
worldly
men
a
world
which
is
itself
governed
by
low
motives
but
human
applause
is
not
a
christian
principle
of
action
nay
it
is
so
adverse
to
christianity
that
our
saviour
himself
assigns
it
as
a
powerful
cause
of
men
not
believing
or
at
least
not
confessing
him
they
loved
the
praise
of
the
eager
desire
of
fame
is
a
sort
of
separation
line
between
paganism
and
christianity
the
ancient
philosophers
have
left
us
many
shining
examples
of
moderation
in
earthly
things
and
of
the
contempt
of
riches
so
far
the
light
of
reason
and
a
noble
carried
them
and
many
a
christian
may
blush
at
these
instances
of
their
superiority
but
of
an
indifference
to
fame
of
a
deadness
to
human
applause
except
as
founded
on
loftiness
of
spirit
disdain
of
their
judges
and
pride
i
do
not
recollect
any
instance
and
yet
said
sir
john
i
remember
seneca
says
in
one
of
his
epistles
that
no
man
expresses
such
a
respect
and
devotion
to
virtue
as
he
who
forfeits
the
of
being
a
good
man
that
he
may
not
forfeit
the
of
being
such
they
might
replied
stanley
incidentally
express
some
such
sentiment
in
a
well
turned
period
to
give
antithesis
to
an
expression
or
weight
to
an
apothegm
they
might
declaim
against
it
in
a
fit
of
disappointment
in
the
burst
of
indignation
excited
by
a
recent
loss
of
popularity
but
i
question
if
they
ever
once
acted
upon
it
i
question
if
marius
himself
sitting
amid
the
ruins
of
carthage
actually
felt
it
seldom
if
ever
does
it
seem
to
have
been
inculcated
as
a
principle
or
enforced
as
a
rule
of
action
nor
could
it
it
was
against
the
canon
law
of
their
foundation
yet
said
sir
john
a
good
man
struggling
with
adversity
is
i
think
represented
by
one
of
their
authors
as
an
object
worthy
of
the
attention
of
the
gods
yes
said
stanley
but
the
divine
approbation
alone
was
never
proposed
as
the
standard
of
right
or
the
reward
of
actions
except
by
divine
revelation
nothing
seems
more
difficult
said
i
to
settle
than
the
standard
of
right
every
man
has
a
standard
of
his
own
which
he
considers
as
of
universal
application
one
makes
his
own
tastes
desires
and
appetites
his
rule
of
right
another
the
example
of
certain
individuals
fallible
like
himself
a
third
and
indeed
the
generality
the
maxims
habits
and
manners
of
the
fashionable
part
of
the
world
sir
john
remarked
that
since
it
is
so
difficult
to
discriminate
between
allowable
indulgence
and
criminal
conformity
the
life
of
a
conscientious
man
if
he
be
not
constitutionally
temperate
or
habitually
firm
must
be
poisoned
with
solicitude
and
perpetually
racked
with
the
fear
of
exceeding
his
limits
my
dear
belfield
replied
stanley
the
peace
and
security
of
a
christian
we
well
know
are
not
left
to
depend
on
constitutional
temperance
or
habitual
firmness
these
are
as
the
young
numidian
says
perfections
that
are
placed
in
bones
and
nerves
there
is
a
higher
and
surer
way
to
prevent
the
solicitude
which
is
by
correcting
the
principle
to
get
the
heart
set
right
to
be
jealous
over
ourselves
to
be
careful
never
to
venture
to
the
edge
of
our
lawful
limits
in
short
and
that
is
the
only
infallible
standard
to
live
in
the
conscientious
practice
of
measuring
all
we
say
and
do
and
think
by
the
unerring
rule
of
god
word
the
impossibility
of
reaching
the
perfection
which
that
rule
requires
said
sir
john
sometimes
discourages
men
as
if
the
attempt
were
hopeless
barlow
replied
that
is
sir
because
they
take
up
with
a
hearsay
christianity
its
reputed
pains
and
penalties
drive
them
off
from
inquiring
for
themselves
they
rest
on
the
surface
if
they
would
go
deeper
they
would
see
that
the
spirit
which
dictated
the
scriptures
is
a
spirit
of
power
as
well
as
a
spirit
of
promise
all
that
he
requires
us
to
do
he
enables
us
to
perform
he
does
not
prescribe
without
furnishing
us
with
in
answer
to
some
further
remarks
of
sir
john
who
spoke
with
due
abhorrence
of
any
instance
of
actual
vice
but
who
seemed
to
have
no
just
idea
of
its
root
and
principle
barlow
observed
while
every
one
agrees
in
reprobating
wicked
actions
few
comparatively
are
aware
of
the
natural
and
habitual
evil
which
lurks
in
the
heart
to
this
the
bible
particularly
directs
our
attention
in
describing
a
bad
character
it
does
not
say
that
his
actions
are
flagitious
but
that
is
not
in
all
his
this
is
the
description
of
a
thoroughly
worldly
man
those
who
are
given
up
completely
to
the
world
to
its
maxims
its
principles
its
cares
or
its
pleasures
can
not
entertain
thoughts
of
god
and
to
be
unmindful
of
his
providence
to
be
regardless
of
his
presence
to
be
insensible
to
his
mercies
must
be
nearly
as
offensive
to
him
as
to
deny
his
existence
excessive
dissipation
a
supreme
love
of
money
or
an
entire
devotedness
to
ambition
drinks
up
that
spirit
swallows
up
that
affection
exhausts
that
vigor
starves
that
zeal
with
which
a
christian
should
devote
himself
to
serve
his
maker
pray
observe
continued
barlow
that
i
am
not
speaking
of
avowed
profligates
but
of
decent
characters
men
who
while
they
are
pursuing
with
keen
intenseness
the
great
objects
of
their
attachment
do
not
deride
or
even
totally
neglect
religious
observances
yet
think
they
do
much
and
well
by
affording
some
odd
scraps
of
refuse
time
to
a
few
weary
prayers
and
sleepy
thoughts
from
a
mind
worn
down
with
engagements
of
pleasure
or
projects
of
accumulation
or
schemes
of
ambition
in
all
these
several
pursuits
there
may
be
nothing
which
to
the
gross
perceptions
of
the
world
would
appear
to
be
moral
turpitude
the
pleasure
may
not
be
profligacy
the
wealth
so
cherished
may
not
have
been
fraudulently
obtained
the
ambition
in
human
estimation
may
not
be
dishonorable
but
an
alienation
from
god
an
indifference
to
eternal
things
a
spirit
incompatible
with
the
spirit
of
the
gospel
will
be
found
at
the
bottom
of
all
these
restless
pursuits
i
am
entirely
of
your
opinion
doctor
said
stanley
it
is
taking
up
with
something
short
of
real
christianity
it
is
an
apostacy
from
the
doctrines
of
the
bible
it
is
the
substitution
of
a
spurious
and
popular
religion
for
that
which
was
revealed
from
heaven
it
is
a
departure
from
the
faith
once
delivered
to
the
saints
that
has
so
fatally
sunk
our
morality
and
given
countenance
to
that
low
standard
of
practical
virtue
which
prevails
if
we
lower
the
principle
if
we
obscure
the
light
if
we
reject
the
influence
if
we
sully
the
purity
if
we
abridge
the
strictness
of
the
divine
law
there
will
remain
no
ascending
power
in
the
soul
no
stirring
spirit
no
quickening
aspiration
after
perfection
no
stretching
forward
after
that
holiness
to
which
the
beatific
vision
is
specifically
promised
it
is
vain
to
expect
that
the
practice
will
rise
higher
than
the
principle
which
inspires
it
that
the
habits
will
be
superior
to
the
motives
which
govern
them
selfishness
security
and
sensuality
said
the
doctor
are
predicted
by
our
saviour
as
the
character
of
the
last
times
in
alluding
to
the
antediluvian
world
and
the
cause
of
its
destruction
eating
drinking
and
marrying
could
not
be
named
in
the
gospel
as
things
censurable
in
themselves
they
being
necessary
to
the
very
existence
of
that
world
which
the
abuse
of
them
was
tending
to
destroy
our
saviour
does
not
describe
criminality
by
the
excess
but
by
the
spirit
of
the
act
he
speaks
of
eating
not
gluttony
of
drinking
not
intoxication
of
marriage
not
licentious
intercourse
this
seems
a
plain
intimation
that
carrying
on
the
transactions
of
the
world
in
the
spirit
of
the
world
and
that
habitual
deadness
to
the
concerns
of
eternity
in
beings
so
alive
to
the
pleasures
or
the
interests
of
the
present
moment
do
not
indicate
a
state
of
safety
even
where
gross
acts
of
vice
may
be
rare
stanley
said
it
was
his
opinion
that
it
is
not
by
a
few
or
even
by
many
instances
of
excessive
wickedness
that
the
moral
state
of
a
country
is
to
be
judged
but
by
a
general
averseness
and
indifference
to
religion
a
few
examples
of
glaring
impiety
said
he
may
furnish
more
subject
for
declamation
but
are
not
near
so
deadly
a
symptom
it
is
no
new
remark
that
more
men
are
undone
by
an
excessive
indulgence
in
things
permitted
than
by
the
commission
of
avowed
sins
how
happy
said
sir
john
are
those
who
by
their
faith
and
piety
are
delivered
from
these
difficulties
my
dear
belfield
replied
stanley
where
are
those
privileged
beings
it
is
one
sad
proof
of
human
infirmity
that
the
best
men
have
continually
these
things
to
struggle
with
what
makes
the
difference
is
that
those
whom
we
call
good
men
struggle
on
to
the
end
while
the
others
not
seeing
the
danger
do
not
struggle
at
all
christians
said
barlow
who
would
strictly
keep
within
the
bounds
prescribed
by
their
religion
should
imitate
the
ancient
romans
who
carefully
watched
that
their
god
terminus
who
defined
their
limits
should
never
recede
the
first
step
of
his
retreat
they
said
would
be
the
destruction
of
their
security
but
doctor
said
sir
john
pray
what
remedy
do
you
recommend
against
this
natural
i
had
almost
said
this
invincible
propensity
to
the
world
i
do
not
mean
a
propensity
merely
to
its
pleasures
and
its
honors
but
a
disposition
to
yield
to
its
dominion
over
the
mind
to
indulge
a
too
earnest
desire
of
standing
well
with
it
to
cherish
a
too
anxious
regard
for
its
good
opinion
the
knowledge
of
the
disease
replied
the
worthy
doctor
should
precede
the
application
of
the
remedy
human
applause
is
by
a
worldly
man
reckoned
not
only
among
the
luxuries
of
life
but
among
articles
of
the
first
necessity
an
undue
desire
to
obtain
it
has
certainly
its
foundation
in
vanity
and
it
is
one
of
our
grand
errors
to
reckon
vanity
a
trivial
fault
an
of
character
and
an
anxious
wish
to
conciliate
all
suffrages
is
an
infirmity
from
which
even
worthy
men
are
not
exempt
nay
it
is
a
weakness
from
which
if
they
are
not
governed
by
a
strict
religious
principle
worthy
men
are
in
most
danger
reputation
being
in
itself
so
very
desirable
a
good
those
who
actually
possess
it
and
in
some
sense
deserve
to
possess
it
are
apt
to
make
it
their
standard
and
to
rest
in
it
as
their
supreme
aim
and
end
you
have
said
sir
john
exposed
the
latent
principle
it
remains
that
you
suggest
its
cure
i
believe
said
barlow
that
the
most
effectual
remedy
would
be
to
excite
in
the
mind
frequent
thoughts
of
our
divine
redeemer
and
of
estimate
of
that
world
on
which
we
so
fondly
set
our
affections
and
whose
approbation
we
are
too
apt
to
make
the
chief
object
of
our
ambition
i
allow
it
to
have
been
necessary
replied
sir
john
that
christ
in
the
great
end
which
he
had
to
accomplish
should
have
been
poor
and
neglected
and
contemned
and
that
he
should
have
trampled
on
the
great
things
of
this
world
human
applause
among
the
rest
but
i
do
not
conceive
that
this
obligation
extends
to
his
followers
nor
that
we
are
called
upon
to
partake
the
poverty
which
he
preferred
or
to
renounce
the
wealth
and
grandeur
which
he
set
at
naught
or
to
imitate
him
in
making
himself
of
no
reputation
it
is
true
said
the
doctor
we
are
not
called
to
resemble
him
in
his
external
circumstances
it
is
not
our
bounden
duty
to
be
necessarily
exposed
to
the
same
contempt
nor
are
we
obliged
to
embrace
the
same
ignominy
yet
it
seems
a
natural
consequence
of
our
christian
profession
that
the
things
which
he
despised
we
should
not
venerate
the
vanities
he
trampled
on
we
should
not
admire
the
world
which
he
censured
we
ought
not
to
idolize
the
ease
which
he
renounced
we
should
not
rate
too
highly
the
fame
which
he
set
at
naught
we
ought
not
anxiously
to
covet
surely
the
followers
of
him
who
was
and
rejected
of
men
should
not
seek
their
highest
gratification
from
the
flattery
and
applause
of
men
the
truth
is
in
all
discourses
on
this
subject
we
are
compelled
continually
to
revert
to
the
observation
that
christianity
is
a
religion
of
the
and
though
we
are
not
called
upon
to
partake
the
poverty
and
meanness
of
his
situation
yet
the
precept
is
clear
and
direct
respecting
the
temper
by
which
we
should
be
governed
the
same
be
in
you
which
was
also
in
christ
jesus
if
therefore
we
happen
to
possess
that
wealth
and
grandeur
which
he
disdained
we
should
them
as
though
we
possessed
them
we
have
a
fair
and
liberal
permission
to
use
them
as
his
gift
and
to
his
glory
but
not
to
erect
them
into
the
supreme
objects
of
our
attachment
in
the
same
manner
in
every
other
point
it
is
still
the
spirit
of
the
act
the
temper
of
the
mind
to
which
we
are
to
look
for
instance
i
do
not
think
that
i
am
obliged
to
show
my
faith
by
sacrificing
my
son
nor
my
obedience
by
selling
all
that
i
have
to
give
to
the
poor
but
i
think
i
am
bound
by
the
spirit
of
these
two
powerful
commands
to
practice
a
cheerful
acquiescence
in
the
whole
will
of
god
in
suffering
and
renouncing
as
well
as
in
doing
when
i
know
what
is
really
his
will
chapter
xx
the
pleasant
reflections
excited
by
the
interesting
conversation
of
the
evening
were
cruelly
interrupted
by
my
faithful
edwards
sir
said
he
when
he
came
to
attend
me
do
you
know
that
all
the
talk
of
the
hall
at
supper
was
that
miss
stanley
is
going
to
be
married
to
young
lord
staunton
he
is
a
cousin
of
carlton
and
coachman
brought
home
the
news
from
thence
yesterday
i
could
not
get
at
the
very
truth
because
comfit
was
out
of
the
way
but
all
the
servants
agree
that
though
he
is
a
lord
and
rich
and
handsome
he
is
not
half
good
enough
for
her
indeed
sir
they
say
he
is
no
better
than
he
should
be
i
was
thunderstruck
at
this
intelligence
it
was
a
trial
i
had
not
suspected
does
he
visit
here
then
edwards
said
i
for
i
have
neither
seen
nor
heard
of
him
no
sir
said
he
but
miss
meets
him
at
mr
carlton
this
shocked
me
beyond
expression
lucilla
meet
a
man
at
another
house
lucilla
carry
on
a
clandestine
engagement
can
carlton
be
capable
of
conniving
at
it
yet
if
it
were
not
clandestine
why
should
he
not
visit
at
the
grove
these
tormenting
reflections
kept
me
awake
the
whole
night
to
acquit
lucilla
edward
story
made
difficult
to
condemn
her
my
heart
found
impossible
one
moment
i
blamed
my
own
foolish
timidity
which
had
kept
me
back
from
making
any
proposal
and
the
next
i
was
glad
that
the
delay
would
enable
me
to
sift
the
truth
and
to
probe
her
character
if
i
do
not
find
consistency
here
said
i
i
shall
renounce
all
confidence
in
human
virtue
i
arose
early
and
went
to
indulge
my
meditations
in
the
garden
i
saw
stanley
sitting
under
the
favorite
oak
i
was
instantly
tempted
to
go
and
open
my
heart
to
him
but
seeing
a
book
in
his
hand
i
feared
to
interrupt
him
and
was
turning
into
another
walk
till
i
had
acquired
more
composure
he
called
after
me
and
invited
me
to
sit
down
how
violent
were
my
fluctuations
how
inconsistent
were
my
feelings
how
much
at
variance
was
my
reason
with
my
heart
the
man
on
earth
with
whom
i
wished
to
confer
invited
me
to
a
conference
with
a
mind
under
the
dominion
of
a
passion
which
i
was
eager
to
declare
yet
agitated
with
an
uncertainty
which
i
had
as
much
reason
to
fear
might
be
painfully
as
pleasantly
removed
i
stood
doubtful
whether
to
seize
or
to
decline
the
occasion
which
thus
presented
itself
to
me
a
moment
reflection
however
convinced
me
that
the
opportunity
was
too
inviting
to
be
neglected
my
impatience
for
an
eclaircissement
on
lord
subject
was
too
powerful
to
be
any
longer
resisted
at
length
with
a
most
unfeigned
diffidence
and
a
hesitation
which
i
feared
would
render
my
words
unintelligible
i
ventured
to
express
my
tender
admiration
of
miss
stanley
and
implored
permission
to
address
her
my
application
did
not
seem
to
surprise
him
he
only
gravely
said
we
will
talk
of
this
some
future
day
this
cold
and
laconic
reply
instantly
sunk
my
spirits
i
was
shocked
and
visibly
confused
it
is
too
late
said
i
to
myself
happy
lord
staunton
he
saw
my
distress
and
taking
my
hand
with
the
utmost
kindness
of
voice
and
manner
said
my
dear
young
friend
content
yourself
for
the
present
with
the
assurance
of
my
entire
esteem
and
affection
this
is
a
very
early
declaration
you
are
scarcely
acquainted
with
lucilla
you
do
not
yet
know
added
he
smiling
half
her
faults
only
tell
me
my
dear
sir
said
i
a
little
and
grasping
his
hand
that
when
you
know
all
mine
you
will
not
reject
me
only
tell
me
that
you
feel
no
repugnance
that
you
have
no
other
views
that
miss
stanley
has
no
other
here
i
stopped
my
voice
failed
the
excess
of
my
emotion
prevented
me
from
finishing
my
sentence
he
encouragingly
said
i
know
not
that
lucilla
has
any
attachment
for
myself
i
have
no
views
hostile
to
your
wishes
you
have
a
double
interest
in
my
heart
you
are
endeared
to
me
by
your
personal
merit
and
by
my
tender
friendship
for
your
beloved
father
but
be
not
impetuous
form
no
sudden
resolution
try
to
assure
yourself
of
my
daughter
affection
before
you
ask
it
of
her
remain
here
another
month
as
my
welcome
guest
as
the
son
of
my
friend
take
that
month
to
examine
your
own
heart
and
to
endeavor
to
obtain
an
interest
in
hers
we
will
then
resume
the
subject
but
my
dear
sir
said
i
is
not
lord
staunton
set
your
heart
at
rest
said
he
though
we
are
both
a
little
aristocratic
in
our
political
principles
yet
when
the
competition
is
for
the
happiness
of
life
and
the
interests
of
virtue
both
lucilla
and
her
father
think
with
dumont
that
a
lord
opposed
against
a
man
is
but
a
man
so
saying
he
quitted
me
but
with
a
benignity
in
his
countenance
and
manner
that
infused
not
only
consolation
but
joy
into
my
heart
my
spirits
were
at
once
elated
to
be
allowed
to
think
of
lucilla
to
be
permitted
to
attach
myself
to
her
to
be
sure
her
heart
was
not
engaged
to
be
invited
to
remain
a
month
longer
under
the
same
roof
with
her
to
see
her
to
hear
her
to
talk
to
her
all
this
was
a
happiness
so
great
that
i
did
not
allow
myself
to
repine
because
it
was
not
all
i
had
wished
to
obtain
i
met
stanley
soon
after
i
perceived
by
her
illuminated
countenance
that
my
proposal
had
been
already
communicated
to
her
i
ventured
to
take
her
hand
and
with
the
most
respectful
earnestness
intreated
her
friendship
her
good
offices
i
dare
not
trust
myself
with
you
just
now
said
she
with
an
affectionate
smile
stanley
will
think
i
abet
rebellion
if
through
my
encouragement
you
should
violate
your
engagements
with
him
but
added
she
kindly
pressing
my
hand
you
need
not
be
much
afraid
of
stanley
sentiments
on
this
point
as
on
all
others
are
exactly
my
own
we
have
but
one
heart
and
one
mind
and
that
heart
and
mind
are
not
unfavorable
to
your
wishes
with
a
tear
in
her
eyes
and
affection
in
her
looks
she
tore
herself
away
evidently
afraid
of
giving
way
to
her
feelings
i
did
not
think
myself
bound
by
any
point
of
honor
to
conceal
the
state
of
my
heart
from
sir
john
belfield
who
with
his
lady
joined
me
soon
after
in
the
garden
i
was
astonished
to
find
that
my
passion
for
miss
stanley
was
no
secret
to
either
of
them
their
penetration
had
left
me
nothing
to
disclose
sir
john
however
looked
serious
and
affected
an
air
of
mystery
which
a
little
alarmed
me
i
own
said
he
there
is
some
danger
of
your
success
i
eagerly
inquired
what
he
thought
i
had
to
fear
you
have
every
thing
to
fear
replied
he
in
a
tone
of
grave
irony
which
a
man
not
of
an
honorable
family
with
a
clear
estate
of
four
thousand
a
year
a
person
that
all
the
ladies
admire
a
mind
which
all
the
men
esteem
and
a
temper
which
endears
you
to
men
women
and
children
can
fear
from
a
little
country
girl
whose
heart
is
as
free
as
a
bird
and
who
if
i
may
judge
by
her
smiles
and
blushes
whenever
you
are
talking
to
her
would
have
no
mortal
objection
to
sing
in
the
same
cage
with
you
it
will
be
a
sad
dull
novel
however
said
lady
belfield
all
is
likely
to
go
on
so
smoothly
that
we
shall
flag
for
want
of
incident
no
difficulties
nor
adventures
to
heighten
the
interest
no
cruel
no
tyrant
father
no
capricious
mistress
no
moated
castle
no
intriguing
confidante
no
treacherous
spy
no
formidable
rival
not
so
much
as
a
duel
or
even
a
challenge
i
fear
to
give
variety
to
the
monotonous
scene
i
mentioned
edwards
report
respecting
lord
staunton
and
owned
how
much
it
had
disturbed
me
that
he
admires
her
said
lady
belfield
is
notorious
that
his
addresses
have
not
been
encouraged
i
have
also
heard
but
not
from
the
family
as
to
lucilla
she
is
the
last
girl
that
would
ever
insinuate
even
to
me
to
whom
she
is
so
unreserved
that
she
had
rejected
so
great
an
offer
i
have
heard
her
express
herself
with
an
indignation
foreign
to
her
general
mildness
against
women
who
are
guilty
of
this
fashionable
this
dishonorable
indelicacy
well
but
charles
said
sir
john
you
must
positively
assume
a
little
dejection
to
diversify
the
business
it
will
give
interest
to
your
countenance
and
pathos
to
your
manner
and
tenderness
to
your
accent
and
you
must
forget
all
attentions
and
neglect
all
civilities
and
you
must
appear
absent
and
and
especially
while
your
fate
hangs
in
some
suspense
and
you
must
read
petrarch
and
repeat
tibullus
and
write
sonnets
and
when
you
are
spoken
to
you
must
not
listen
and
you
must
wander
in
the
grove
by
moonshine
and
talk
to
the
oreads
and
the
dryads
and
the
naiads
oh
no
unfortunately
i
am
afraid
there
are
no
naiads
within
hearing
you
must
make
the
woods
vocal
with
the
name
of
lucilla
luckily
is
such
a
poetical
name
that
echo
wo
be
ashamed
to
repeat
it
i
have
gone
through
it
all
charles
and
know
every
highway
and
byway
in
the
map
of
love
i
will
however
be
serious
for
one
moment
and
tell
you
for
your
comfort
that
though
at
your
age
i
was
full
as
much
in
for
it
as
you
are
now
yet
after
ten
years
union
lady
belfield
has
enabled
me
to
declare
how
much
the
wife
is
dearer
than
the
bride
a
tear
glistened
in
her
soft
eyes
at
this
tender
compliment
just
at
that
moment
lucilla
happened
to
cross
the
lawn
at
a
distance
at
sight
of
her
i
could
not
as
i
pointed
to
her
forbear
exclaiming
in
the
words
of
sir
john
favorite
poet
there
doth
beauty
dwell
there
most
conspicuous
in
outward
shape
where
dawns
the
high
expression
of
a
mind
this
is
very
fine
said
sir
john
sarcastically
i
admire
all
you
young
enthusiastic
philosophers
with
your
intellectual
refinement
you
pretend
to
be
captivated
only
with
i
observe
however
that
previous
to
your
raptures
you
always
take
care
to
get
this
mind
lodged
in
a
fair
and
youthful
form
this
mental
beauty
is
always
prudently
enshrined
in
some
elegant
corporeal
frame
before
it
is
worshiped
i
should
be
glad
to
see
some
of
these
intellectual
adorers
in
love
with
the
mind
of
an
old
or
ugly
woman
i
never
heard
any
of
you
fall
into
ecstasies
in
descanting
on
the
mind
of
your
grandmother
after
some
further
irony
they
left
me
to
indulge
my
meditations
in
the
nature
of
which
a
single
hour
had
made
so
pleasant
a
revolution
chapter
xxi
the
conversation
of
two
men
bred
at
the
same
school
or
college
when
they
happen
to
meet
afterward
is
commonly
uninteresting
not
to
say
tiresome
to
a
third
person
as
involving
local
circumstances
in
which
he
has
no
concern
but
this
was
not
always
the
case
since
the
meeting
of
my
two
friends
something
was
generally
to
be
gained
by
their
communications
even
on
these
unpromising
topics
at
breakfast
stanley
said
sir
john
you
will
see
here
at
dinner
our
old
college
acquaintance
ned
tyrrel
though
he
does
not
commonly
live
at
the
family
house
in
this
neighborhood
but
at
a
little
place
he
has
in
buckinghamshire
he
comes
among
us
periodically
to
receive
his
rents
he
always
invites
himself
for
his
society
is
not
the
most
engaging
i
heard
replied
sir
john
that
he
became
a
notorious
profligate
after
he
left
cambridge
though
i
have
lost
sight
of
him
ever
since
we
parted
there
but
i
was
glad
to
learn
lately
that
he
is
become
quite
a
reformed
man
he
is
so
far
reformed
replied
stanley
that
he
is
no
longer
grossly
licentious
but
in
laying
down
the
vices
of
youth
he
has
taken
up
successively
those
which
he
thought
better
suited
to
the
successive
stages
of
his
progress
as
he
withdrew
himself
from
his
loose
habits
and
connections
ambition
became
his
governing
passion
he
courted
public
favor
thirsted
for
place
and
distinction
and
labored
by
certain
obliquities
and
some
little
sacrifices
of
principle
to
obtain
promotion
finding
it
did
not
answer
and
all
his
hopes
failing
he
now
rails
at
ambition
wonders
men
will
wound
their
consciences
and
renounce
their
peace
for
vain
applause
and
bubble
reputation
his
sole
delight
at
present
i
hear
is
in
amassing
money
and
reading
controversial
divinity
avarice
has
supplanted
ambition
just
as
ambition
expelled
profligacy
in
the
interval
in
which
he
was
passing
from
one
of
these
stages
to
the
other
in
a
very
uneasy
state
of
mind
he
dropped
in
by
accident
where
a
famous
irregular
preacher
was
disseminating
his
antinomian
doctrines
caught
by
his
vehement
but
coarse
eloquence
and
captivated
by
an
alluring
doctrine
which
promised
much
while
it
required
little
he
adopted
the
soothing
but
fallacious
tenet
it
is
true
i
hear
he
is
become
a
more
respectable
man
in
his
conduct
but
i
doubt
though
i
have
not
lately
seen
him
if
his
present
state
may
not
be
rather
worse
than
his
former
ones
in
the
two
previous
stages
he
was
disturbed
and
dissatisfied
here
he
has
taken
up
his
rest
out
of
this
stronghold
it
is
not
probable
that
any
subsequent
vice
will
ever
drive
him
or
true
religion
draw
him
he
sometimes
attends
public
worship
but
as
he
thinks
no
part
of
it
but
the
sermon
of
much
value
it
is
only
when
he
likes
the
preacher
he
has
little
notion
of
the
respect
due
to
established
institutions
and
does
not
heartily
like
any
precomposed
form
of
prayer
not
even
our
incomparable
liturgy
he
reads
such
religious
books
only
as
tend
to
establish
his
own
opinions
and
talks
and
disputes
loudly
on
certain
doctrinal
points
but
an
accumulating
christian
and
a
christian
who
for
the
purpose
of
accumulation
is
said
to
be
uncharitable
and
even
somewhat
oppressive
is
a
paradox
which
i
can
not
solve
and
an
anomaly
which
i
can
not
comprehend
covetousness
is
as
i
said
a
more
creditable
vice
than
ned
former
ones
but
for
that
very
reason
more
dangerous
from
this
sober
vice
said
i
proceeded
the
blackest
crime
ever
perpetrated
by
human
wickedness
for
it
does
not
appear
that
judas
in
his
direful
treason
was
instigated
by
malice
it
is
observable
that
when
our
saviour
names
this
sin
it
is
with
an
emphatical
warning
as
knowing
its
mischief
to
be
greater
because
its
scandal
was
less
not
contented
with
a
single
caution
he
doubles
his
exhortation
heed
and
of
covetousness
after
some
remarks
of
sir
john
which
i
do
not
recollect
stanley
said
i
did
not
intend
making
a
philippic
against
covetousness
a
sin
to
which
i
believe
no
one
here
is
addicted
let
us
not
however
plume
ourselves
in
not
being
guilty
of
a
vice
to
which
as
we
have
no
natural
bias
so
in
not
committing
it
we
resist
no
temptation
what
i
meant
to
insist
on
was
that
exchanging
a
turbulent
for
a
quiet
sin
or
a
scandalous
for
an
orderly
one
is
not
reformation
or
if
you
will
allow
me
the
strong
word
is
not
conversion
tyrrel
according
to
his
appointment
came
to
dinner
and
brought
with
him
his
nephew
edward
tyrrel
whom
he
had
lately
entered
at
the
university
with
a
design
to
prepare
him
for
holy
orders
he
was
a
young
man
but
his
previous
education
was
said
to
have
been
very
much
neglected
and
was
rather
deficient
in
the
necessary
learning
stanley
had
heard
that
tyrrel
had
two
reasons
for
breeding
him
to
the
church
in
the
first
place
he
fancied
it
was
the
cheapest
profession
and
in
the
next
he
had
labored
to
infuse
into
him
some
particular
opinions
of
his
own
which
he
wished
to
disseminate
through
his
nephew
sir
george
aston
having
accidentally
called
he
was
prevailed
on
to
stay
and
barlow
was
one
of
the
party
tyrrel
by
his
observations
soon
enabled
us
to
discover
that
his
religion
had
altered
nothing
but
his
language
he
seemed
evidently
more
fond
of
controversy
than
of
truth
and
the
whole
turn
of
his
conversation
indicated
that
he
derived
his
religious
security
rather
from
the
adoption
of
a
party
than
from
the
implantation
of
a
new
principle
his
discourse
is
altered
said
stanley
to
me
afterward
but
i
greatly
fear
his
heart
and
affections
remain
unchanged
stanley
contrived
for
the
sake
of
his
two
academical
guests
particularly
young
tyrrel
to
divert
the
conversation
to
the
subject
of
learning
more
especially
clerical
learning
in
answer
to
a
remark
of
mine
on
the
satisfaction
i
had
felt
in
seeing
such
a
happy
union
of
learning
and
piety
in
two
clergymen
who
had
lately
dined
at
the
grove
stanley
said
literature
is
an
excellent
thing
when
it
is
not
the
best
thing
a
man
has
it
can
surely
be
no
offense
to
our
maker
to
cultivate
carefully
his
highest
natural
gift
our
reason
in
pious
men
it
is
peculiarly
important
as
the
neglect
of
such
cultivation
in
certain
individuals
has
led
to
much
error
in
religion
and
given
much
just
offense
to
the
irreligious
who
are
very
to
the
faults
of
pious
characters
i
therefore
truly
rejoice
to
see
a
higher
tone
of
literature
now
prevailing
especially
in
so
many
of
our
pious
young
divines
the
deficiency
of
learning
in
some
of
their
predecessors
having
served
to
bring
not
only
themselves
but
religion
also
into
contempt
especially
with
men
who
have
only
learning
i
say
nothing
remarked
tyrrel
against
the
necessity
of
learning
in
a
lawyer
because
it
may
help
him
to
lead
a
judge
and
to
mislead
a
jury
nor
in
a
physician
because
it
may
advance
his
credit
by
enabling
him
to
conceal
the
deficiencies
of
his
art
nor
in
a
private
gentleman
because
it
may
keep
him
out
of
worse
mischief
but
i
see
no
use
of
learning
in
the
clergy
there
is
my
friend
barlow
i
would
willingly
give
up
all
his
learning
if
he
would
go
a
little
deeper
into
the
doctrines
he
professes
to
preach
indeed
said
stanley
i
should
think
barlow
various
knowledge
of
little
value
did
he
exhibit
the
smallest
deficiency
in
the
great
points
to
which
you
allude
but
when
i
am
persuaded
that
his
learning
is
so
far
from
detracting
from
his
piety
that
it
enables
him
to
render
it
more
extensively
useful
i
can
not
wish
him
dispossessed
of
that
knowledge
which
adorns
his
religion
without
diminishing
its
good
effects
you
will
allow
said
tyrrel
that
those
first
great
publishers
of
christianity
the
apostles
had
none
of
this
vain
learning
i
admit
said
stanley
that
it
is
frequently
pleaded
by
the
despisers
of
learning
that
the
apostles
were
illiterate
the
fact
is
too
notorious
and
the
answer
too
obvious
to
require
to
be
dwelt
upon
but
it
is
unfortunately
adduced
to
illustrate
a
position
to
which
it
can
never
apply
the
vindication
of
an
unlettered
clergy
it
is
a
hackneyed
remark
but
not
the
less
true
for
being
old
that
the
wisdom
of
god
chose
to
accomplish
the
first
promulgation
of
the
gospel
by
illiterate
men
to
prove
that
the
work
was
his
own
and
that
its
success
depended
not
on
the
instruments
employed
but
on
the
divinity
of
the
truth
itself
but
if
the
almighty
chose
to
establish
his
religion
by
miracles
he
chooses
to
carry
it
on
by
means
and
he
no
more
sends
an
ignorant
peasant
or
fisherman
to
instruct
men
in
christianity
now
than
he
appointed
a
socrates
or
a
plato
to
be
its
publisher
at
first
as
however
there
is
a
great
difference
in
the
situations
so
there
may
be
a
proportionate
difference
allowed
in
the
attainments
of
the
clergy
i
do
not
say
it
is
necessary
for
every
village
curate
to
be
a
profound
scholar
but
as
he
may
not
always
remain
in
obscurity
there
is
no
necessity
for
his
being
a
contemptible
one
sir
john
remarked
that
what
has
been
said
of
those
who
affect
to
despise
birth
has
been
applied
also
to
those
who
decry
learning
neither
is
ever
undervalued
except
by
men
who
are
destitute
of
them
and
it
is
worthy
of
observation
that
as
literature
and
religion
both
sunk
in
the
dark
ages
so
both
emerged
at
the
same
auspicious
era
stanley
finding
that
barlow
was
not
forward
to
embark
in
a
subject
which
he
considered
as
rather
personal
said
it
is
presumptuous
to
observe
that
the
apostles
were
unlettered
men
yet
those
instruments
who
were
to
be
employed
in
services
singularly
difficult
the
almighty
condescended
partly
to
fit
for
their
peculiar
work
by
great
human
attainments
the
apostle
of
the
gentiles
was
brought
up
at
the
feet
of
gamaliel
and
moses
who
was
destined
to
the
high
office
of
a
great
legislator
was
instructed
in
all
the
wisdom
of
the
most
learned
nation
then
existing
the
jewish
though
under
the
guidance
of
inspiration
itself
did
not
fill
his
station
the
worse
for
this
preparatory
instruction
to
how
important
a
use
the
apostle
converted
erudition
we
may
infer
from
his
conduct
in
the
most
learned
and
polished
assembly
in
the
world
he
did
not
unnecessarily
exasperate
the
polite
athenians
by
coarse
upbraiding
or
illiterate
clamor
but
he
attacked
them
on
their
own
ground
with
what
discriminating
wisdom
with
what
powerful
reasoning
did
he
unfold
to
them
that
god
whom
they
ignorantly
worshiped
with
what
temper
with
what
elegance
did
he
expose
their
shallow
theology
had
he
been
as
unacquainted
with
religion
as
they
were
with
he
had
wanted
the
appropriate
ground
on
which
to
build
his
instruction
he
seized
on
the
inscription
of
their
own
pagan
altar
as
a
text
from
which
to
preach
the
doctrine
of
christianity
from
his
knowledge
of
their
errors
he
was
enabled
to
advance
the
cause
of
truth
he
made
their
poetry
which
he
quoted
and
their
mythology
which
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
explode
if
he
had
not
understood
it
a
thesis
from
which
to
deduce
the
doctrine
of
the
resurrection
thus
softening
their
prejudices
and
letting
them
see
the
infinite
superiority
of
that
christianity
which
he
enforced
to
the
mere
learning
and
mental
cultivation
on
which
they
so
highly
valued
themselves
by
the
same
sober
discretion
acute
reasoning
and
graceful
elegance
he
afterward
obtained
a
patient
hearing
and
a
favorable
judgment
from
king
agrippa
it
has
always
appeared
to
me
returned
barlow
that
a
strong
reason
why
the
younger
part
of
a
clergyman
life
should
be
in
a
good
measure
devoted
to
learning
is
that
he
may
afterward
discover
its
comparative
vanity
it
would
have
been
a
less
difficult
sacrifice
for
paul
to
profess
that
he
renounced
all
things
for
religion
if
he
had
had
nothing
to
renounce
and
to
count
all
things
as
dross
in
the
comparison
if
he
had
had
no
gold
to
put
in
the
empty
scale
gregory
nazianzen
one
of
the
most
accomplished
masters
of
greek
literature
declared
that
the
chief
value
which
he
set
upon
it
was
that
in
possessing
it
he
had
something
of
worth
to
esteem
as
nothing
in
comparison
of
christian
truth
and
it
is
delightful
to
hear
selden
and
grotius
and
pascal
and
salmasius
whom
i
may
be
allowed
to
quote
without
being
suspected
of
professional
prejudice
as
none
of
them
were
clergymen
while
they
warmly
recommended
to
others
that
learning
of
which
they
themselves
were
the
most
astonishing
examples
at
the
same
time
dedicating
their
lives
to
the
advancement
of
religion
it
is
delightful
i
say
to
hear
them
acknowledge
that
their
learning
was
only
valuable
as
it
put
it
in
their
power
to
promote
christianity
and
to
have
something
to
sacrifice
for
its
sake
i
can
willingly
allow
said
tyrrel
that
a
poet
a
dramatic
poet
especially
may
study
the
works
of
the
great
critics
of
antiquity
with
some
profit
but
that
a
christian
writer
of
sermons
can
have
any
just
ground
for
studying
a
pagan
critic
it
is
to
me
quite
inconceivable
and
yet
sir
replied
stanley
a
sermon
is
a
work
which
demands
regularity
of
plan
as
well
as
a
poem
it
requires
too
something
of
the
same
unity
arrangement
divisions
and
lucid
order
as
a
tragedy
something
of
the
exordium
and
the
peroration
which
belong
to
the
composition
of
the
orator
i
do
not
mean
that
he
is
constantly
to
exhibit
all
this
but
he
should
always
understand
it
and
a
discreet
clergyman
especially
one
who
is
to
preach
before
auditors
of
the
higher
rank
and
who
in
order
to
obtain
respect
from
them
wishes
to
excel
in
the
art
of
composition
will
scarcely
be
less
attentive
to
form
his
judgment
by
some
acquaintance
with
longinus
and
quintilian
than
a
dramatic
poet
a
writer
of
verse
it
is
true
may
please
to
a
certain
degree
by
the
force
of
mere
genius
and
a
writer
of
sermons
will
instruct
by
the
mere
power
of
his
piety
but
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
will
ever
write
well
if
they
do
not
possess
the
principles
of
good
writing
and
form
themselves
on
the
models
of
good
writers
writing
said
sir
john
to
a
certain
degree
is
an
art
or
if
you
please
a
trade
and
as
no
man
is
allowed
to
set
up
in
an
ordinary
trade
till
he
has
served
a
long
apprenticeship
to
its
the
word
i
think
used
in
indentures
so
no
man
should
set
up
for
a
writer
till
he
knows
somewhat
of
the
mysteries
of
the
art
he
is
about
to
practice
he
may
after
all
if
he
want
talents
produce
a
vapid
and
inefficient
book
but
possess
what
talents
he
may
he
will
without
knowledge
produce
a
crude
and
indigested
one
tyrrel
however
still
insisted
upon
it
that
in
a
christian
minister
the
lustre
of
learning
is
tinsel
and
human
wisdom
folly
i
am
entirely
of
your
opinion
returned
stanley
if
he
rest
in
his
learning
as
an
instead
of
using
it
as
a
if
the
fame
or
the
pleasure
or
even
the
human
profit
of
learning
be
his
ultimate
object
learning
in
a
clergyman
without
religion
is
dross
is
nothing
not
so
religion
without
learning
i
am
persuaded
that
much
good
is
done
by
men
who
though
deficient
in
this
respect
are
abundant
in
zeal
and
piety
but
the
good
they
do
arises
from
the
exertion
of
their
piety
and
not
from
the
deficiency
of
their
learning
their
labors
are
beneficial
from
the
talent
they
exercise
and
not
from
their
want
of
another
talent
the
spirit
of
god
can
work
and
often
does
work
by
feeble
instruments
and
divine
truth
by
its
own
omnipotent
energy
can
effect
its
own
purposes
but
particular
instances
do
not
go
to
prove
that
the
instrument
ought
not
to
be
fitted
and
polished
and
sharpened
for
its
allotted
work
every
student
should
be
emulously
watchful
that
he
do
not
diminish
the
stock
of
professional
credit
by
his
idleness
he
should
be
stimulated
to
individual
exertion
by
bearing
in
mind
that
the
english
clergy
have
always
been
allowed
by
foreigners
to
be
the
most
learned
body
in
the
world
barlow
was
of
opinion
that
what
stanley
had
said
of
the
value
of
knowledge
did
not
at
all
militate
against
such
fundamental
prime
truths
as
this
is
life
eternal
to
god
and
jesus
christ
whom
he
has
sent
i
desire
to
nothing
save
jesus
christ
the
natural
man
can
not
the
things
of
the
spirit
of
god
the
world
by
wisdom
not
god
and
a
hundred
other
such
passages
ay
doctor
said
tyrrel
now
you
talk
a
little
more
like
a
christian
minister
but
from
the
greater
part
of
what
has
been
asserted
you
are
all
of
you
such
advocates
for
human
reason
and
human
learning
as
to
give
an
air
of
paganism
to
your
sentiments
surely
said
stanley
it
does
not
diminish
the
utility
though
it
abases
the
pride
of
learning
that
christianity
did
not
come
into
the
world
by
human
discovery
or
the
disquisitions
of
reason
but
by
immediate
revelation
those
who
adopt
your
way
of
thinking
tyrrel
should
bear
in
mind
that
the
work
of
god
in
changing
the
heart
is
not
intended
to
supply
the
place
of
the
human
faculties
god
expects
in
his
most
highly
favored
servants
the
diligent
exercise
of
their
natural
powers
and
if
any
human
being
has
a
stronger
call
for
the
exercise
of
wisdom
and
judgment
than
another
it
is
a
religious
clergyman
christianity
does
not
supersede
the
use
of
natural
gifts
but
turns
them
into
their
proper
channel
one
distinction
has
often
struck
me
the
enemy
of
mankind
seizes
on
the
soul
through
the
medium
of
the
passions
and
senses
the
divine
friend
of
man
addresses
him
through
his
rational
powers
eyes
of
your
understanding
being
says
the
apostle
here
i
ventured
to
observe
that
the
highest
panegyric
bestowed
on
one
of
the
brightest
luminaries
of
our
church
is
that
his
name
is
seldom
mentioned
without
the
epithet
being
prefixed
to
it
yet
does
hooker
want
fervor
does
hooker
want
zeal
does
hooker
want
courage
in
declaring
the
whole
counsel
of
god
i
hope
said
sir
john
we
have
now
no
clergymen
to
whom
we
may
apply
the
biting
sarcasm
of
south
on
some
of
the
popular
but
illiterate
preachers
of
the
opposite
party
in
his
day
there
was
all
the
confusion
of
babel
without
the
gift
of
tongues
and
yet
returned
stanley
that
party
produced
some
great
scholars
and
many
eminently
pious
men
but
look
back
to
that
day
and
especially
to
the
period
a
little
antecedent
to
it
at
those
prodigies
of
erudition
the
old
bishops
and
other
divines
of
our
church
they
were
perhaps
somewhat
too
profuse
of
their
learning
in
their
discourses
or
rather
they
were
so
brimful
that
they
involuntarily
overflowed
a
juster
taste
in
our
time
avoids
that
lavish
display
which
then
not
only
crowded
the
margin
but
forced
itself
into
every
part
of
the
body
of
the
work
the
display
of
erudition
might
be
wrong
but
one
thing
is
clear
it
proved
they
had
it
and
as
dryden
said
when
he
accused
of
having
too
much
wit
all
it
is
a
good
crime
we
may
justly
said
barlow
in
the
refinement
of
modern
taste
censure
their
prolixity
and
ridicule
their
redundancies
we
may
smile
at
their
divisions
which
are
numberless
and
at
their
subdivisions
which
are
endless
we
may
allow
that
this
labor
for
perspicuity
sometimes
produced
perplexity
but
let
us
confess
they
always
went
to
the
bottom
of
whatever
they
embarked
in
they
ransacked
the
stores
of
ancient
learning
and
the
treasures
of
modern
science
not
to
indulge
their
vanity
by
obtruding
their
acquirements
but
to
prove
to
adorn
and
to
illustrate
the
doctrine
they
delivered
how
incredible
must
their
industry
have
been
when
the
bare
transcript
of
their
voluminous
folios
seems
alone
sufficient
to
have
occupied
a
long
life
the
method
said
i
which
they
adopted
of
saying
every
thing
that
could
be
said
on
all
topics
and
exhausting
them
to
the
very
dregs
though
it
may
and
does
tire
the
patience
of
the
reader
yet
it
never
leaves
him
ignorant
and
of
two
evils
had
not
an
author
better
be
tedious
than
superficial
from
an
overflowing
vessel
you
may
gather
more
indeed
than
you
want
but
from
an
empty
one
you
can
gather
nothing
it
appears
to
me
said
tyrrel
that
you
wish
to
make
a
clergyman
every
thing
but
a
christian
and
to
bestow
upon
him
every
requisite
except
faith
god
forbid
that
i
should
make
any
comparison
between
human
learning
and
christian
principle
replied
stanley
the
one
is
indeed
lighter
than
the
dust
of
the
balance
when
weighed
against
the
other
all
i
contend
for
is
that
they
are
not
incompatible
and
that
human
knowledge
used
only
in
subserviency
to
that
of
the
scriptures
may
advance
the
interests
of
religion
for
the
better
elucidation
of
those
scriptures
a
clergyman
should
know
not
a
little
of
ancient
languages
without
some
insight
into
remote
history
and
antiquities
especially
the
jewish
he
will
be
unable
to
explain
many
of
the
manners
and
customs
recorded
in
the
sacred
volume
ignorance
on
some
of
these
points
has
drawn
many
attacks
on
our
religion
from
skeptical
writers
as
to
a
thorough
knowledge
of
ecclesiastical
history
it
would
be
superfluous
to
recommend
that
it
being
the
history
of
his
own
immediate
profession
it
is
therefore
requisite
not
only
for
the
general
purposes
of
instruction
but
that
he
may
be
enabled
to
guard
against
modern
innovation
by
knowing
the
origin
and
progress
of
the
various
heresies
with
which
the
church
in
all
ages
has
been
infested
but
said
tyrrel
he
may
be
thoroughly
acquainted
with
all
this
and
not
have
one
spark
of
light
he
may
indeed
said
the
doctor
with
deep
concern
i
allow
it
i
will
go
further
the
pride
of
learning
when
not
subdued
by
religion
may
help
to
extinguish
that
spark
reason
has
been
too
much
decried
by
one
party
and
too
much
deified
by
the
other
the
difference
between
reason
and
revelation
seems
to
be
the
same
as
between
the
eye
and
the
light
the
one
is
the
organ
of
vision
the
other
the
source
of
illumination
take
notice
stanley
observed
tyrrel
that
if
i
can
help
it
i
never
attend
your
accomplished
clergyman
i
have
not
yet
completed
the
circle
of
his
accomplishments
said
stanley
smiling
besides
what
we
call
book
learning
there
is
another
species
of
knowledge
in
which
some
truly
good
men
are
sadly
deficient
i
mean
an
acquaintance
with
human
nature
the
knowledge
of
the
world
and
of
him
who
made
it
the
study
of
the
heart
of
man
and
of
him
who
has
the
hearts
of
all
men
in
his
hand
enable
a
minister
to
excel
in
the
art
of
instruction
one
kind
of
knowledge
reflecting
light
upon
the
other
the
knowledge
of
mankind
then
i
may
venture
to
assert
is
next
to
religion
one
of
the
first
requisites
of
a
preacher
and
i
can
not
help
ascribing
the
little
success
which
has
sometimes
attended
the
ministry
of
even
worthy
men
to
their
want
of
this
grand
ingredient
it
will
diminish
the
use
they
might
make
of
the
great
doctrines
of
our
religion
if
they
are
ignorant
of
the
various
modifications
of
the
human
character
to
which
those
doctrines
are
to
be
addressed
as
no
man
ever
made
a
true
poet
without
this
talent
one
may
venture
to
say
that
few
without
it
have
ever
made
eminent
preachers
destitute
of
this
the
most
elaborate
addresses
will
be
only
random
shot
which
if
they
hit
will
be
more
owing
to
chance
than
to
skill
without
this
knowledge
warmed
by
christian
affection
guided
by
christian
judgment
and
tempered
with
christian
meekness
a
clergyman
will
not
be
able
in
the
pulpit
to
accommodate
himself
to
the
various
wants
of
his
hearers
without
this
knowledge
in
his
private
spiritual
visits
he
will
resemble
those
empirics
in
medicine
who
have
but
one
method
of
treatment
for
all
diseases
and
who
apply
indiscriminately
the
same
pill
and
the
same
drop
to
the
various
distempers
of
all
ages
sexes
and
constitutions
this
spirit
of
accommodation
does
not
consist
in
falsifying
or
abridging
or
softening
or
disguising
any
truth
but
in
applying
truth
in
every
form
communicating
it
in
every
direction
and
diverting
it
into
every
channel
some
good
men
seem
sadly
to
forget
that
precept
a
for
they
act
as
if
all
characters
were
exactly
alike
you
talk
said
tyrrel
as
if
you
would
wish
clergymen
to
depart
from
the
singleness
of
truth
and
preach
two
gospels
far
from
it
replied
stanley
but
though
truth
is
single
the
human
character
is
multiplied
almost
to
infinity
and
can
not
be
addressed
with
advantage
if
it
be
not
well
understood
i
am
ashamed
of
having
said
so
much
on
such
a
subject
in
presence
of
barlow
who
is
silent
through
delicacy
i
will
only
add
that
a
learned
young
clergyman
is
not
driven
for
necessary
relaxation
to
improper
amusements
his
mind
will
be
too
highly
set
to
be
satisfied
with
those
light
diversions
which
purloin
time
without
affording
the
necessary
renovation
to
the
body
and
spirits
which
is
the
true
and
lawful
end
of
all
amusement
in
all
circumstances
learning
confers
dignity
on
his
character
it
enables
him
to
raise
the
tone
of
general
conversation
and
is
a
safe
kind
of
medium
with
persons
of
a
higher
class
who
are
not
religious
and
it
will
always
put
it
in
his
power
to
keep
the
standard
of
intercourse
above
the
degrading
topics
of
diversions
sports
and
vulgar
gossip
you
see
tyrrel
said
the
doctor
that
a
prudent
combatant
thinks
only
of
defending
himself
on
that
side
where
he
is
assaulted
if
stanley
antagonist
had
been
a
vehement
advocate
for
clerical
learning
as
the
great
essential
to
his
profession
he
would
have
been
the
first
to
caution
him
against
the
pride
and
inflation
which
often
attend
learning
when
not
governed
by
religion
learning
not
so
governed
might
injure
christian
humility
and
thus
become
a
far
more
formidable
enemy
to
religion
than
that
which
it
was
called
in
to
oppose
sir
john
said
smiling
i
will
not
apply
to
the
clergy
what
rasselas
says
to
imlac
after
he
had
been
enumerating
the
numberless
qualities
necessary
to
the
perfection
of
the
poetic
art
hast
convinced
me
that
no
man
can
be
a
poet
but
if
all
stanley
says
be
just
i
will
venture
to
assert
that
no
common
share
of
industry
and
zeal
will
qualify
a
young
student
for
that
sacred
profession
i
have
indeed
no
experience
on
the
subject
as
it
relates
to
the
clerical
order
but
i
conceive
in
general
that
learning
is
the
best
human
preservative
of
virtue
that
it
safely
fills
up
leisure
and
honorably
adorns
life
even
where
it
does
not
form
the
business
of
it
learning
too
said
i
has
this
strong
recommendation
that
it
is
the
offspring
of
a
most
valuable
virtue
i
mean
industry
a
quality
on
which
i
am
ashamed
to
see
pagans
frequently
set
a
higher
value
than
we
seem
to
do
i
believe
indeed
replied
sir
john
that
the
ancients
had
a
higher
idea
of
industry
and
severe
application
than
we
have
tully
calls
them
the
and
alexander
said
that
slaves
might
indulge
in
sloth
but
that
it
was
a
most
royal
thing
to
labor
it
has
been
the
error
of
sensible
men
of
the
world
to
erect
talents
and
learning
into
idols
which
they
would
have
universally
and
exclusively
worshiped
this
has
perhaps
driven
some
religious
men
into
such
a
fear
of
learning
that
they
do
not
cultivate
it
at
all
hence
the
intervals
between
their
religious
employments
and
intervals
there
must
be
while
we
are
invested
with
these
frail
bodies
are
languid
and
insipid
wasted
in
trifling
and
sauntering
nay
it
is
well
if
this
disoccupation
of
the
intellect
do
not
lead
from
sloth
to
improper
indulgences
you
are
perfectly
right
said
sir
john
our
worthy
friend
thompson
is
a
living
illustration
of
your
remark
he
was
at
college
with
us
he
brought
from
thence
a
competent
share
of
knowledge
has
a
fair
understanding
and
the
manners
of
a
gentleman
for
several
years
past
he
has
not
only
adopted
a
religious
character
but
is
truly
pious
as
he
is
much
in
earnest
he
very
properly
assigns
a
considerable
portion
of
his
time
to
religious
reading
but
as
he
is
of
no
profession
the
intermediate
hours
often
hang
heavy
on
his
hands
he
continues
to
live
in
some
measure
in
the
world
without
the
inconsistency
of
entering
into
its
pursuits
but
having
renounced
the
study
of
human
learning
and
yet
accustoming
himself
to
mix
occasionally
with
general
society
he
has
few
subjects
in
common
with
his
company
but
is
dull
and
silent
in
all
rational
conversation
of
which
religion
is
not
the
professed
object
he
takes
so
little
interest
in
any
literary
or
political
discussion
however
useful
that
it
is
evident
nothing
but
his
good
breeding
prevents
his
falling
asleep
at
the
same
time
he
scruples
not
to
violate
consistency
in
another
respect
for
his
table
is
so
elaborately
luxurious
that
it
seems
as
if
he
were
willing
to
add
to
the
pleasures
of
sense
what
he
deducts
from
those
of
intellect
i
have
often
thought
said
stanley
of
sending
him
sermons
on
industry
in
our
calling
as
christians
industry
as
gentlemen
and
industry
as
which
sermons
by
the
way
i
intended
to
have
made
my
son
read
at
least
once
a
year
had
he
lived
that
he
might
see
the
consistency
the
compatibility
nay
the
analogy
of
the
two
latter
with
the
former
i
wish
the
spirit
of
these
three
discourses
was
infused
into
every
gentleman
every
scholar
and
every
christian
through
the
land
for
my
own
part
i
should
have
sedulously
labored
to
make
my
son
a
sound
scholar
while
i
should
have
labored
still
more
sedulously
to
convince
him
that
the
value
of
learning
depends
solely
on
the
purposes
to
which
it
is
devoted
i
would
have
a
christian
gentleman
able
to
beat
the
world
at
its
own
weapons
and
convince
it
that
it
is
not
from
penury
of
mind
or
inability
to
distinguish
himself
in
other
matters
that
he
applies
himself
to
seek
that
wisdom
which
is
from
above
that
he
does
not
fly
to
religion
as
a
shelter
from
the
ignominy
of
ignorance
but
from
a
deep
conviction
of
the
comparative
vanity
of
that
very
learning
which
he
yet
is
so
assiduous
to
acquire
during
this
conversation
it
was
amusing
to
observe
the
different
impressions
made
on
the
minds
of
our
two
college
guests
young
tyrrel
who
with
moderate
parts
and
slender
application
had
been
taught
to
adopt
some
of
his
uncle
dogmas
as
the
cheapest
way
of
being
wise
greedily
swallowed
his
eulogium
of
clerical
ignorance
which
the
young
man
seemed
to
feel
as
a
vindication
of
his
own
neglected
studies
and
an
encouragement
to
his
own
mediocrity
of
intellect
while
the
interesting
young
baronet
though
silent
through
modesty
discovered
in
his
intelligent
eyes
evident
marks
of
satisfaction
in
hearing
that
literature
for
which
he
was
every
day
acquiring
a
higher
relish
warmly
recommended
as
the
best
pursuit
of
a
gentleman
by
the
two
men
in
the
world
for
whose
judgment
he
entertained
the
highest
reverence
at
the
same
time
it
raised
his
veneration
for
christian
piety
when
he
saw
it
so
sedulously
practiced
by
these
advocates
for
human
learning
chapter
xxii
during
these
conversations
i
remarked
that
lucilla
though
she
commonly
observed
the
most
profound
silence
had
her
attention
always
riveted
on
the
speaker
if
that
speaker
was
barlow
or
her
father
or
any
one
whom
she
thought
entitled
to
particular
respect
she
gently
laid
down
her
work
and
as
quietly
resumed
it
when
they
had
done
speaking
i
observed
to
sir
john
belfield
afterward
as
we
were
walking
together
how
modestly
flattering
her
manner
was
when
any
of
us
were
reading
how
intelligent
her
silence
how
her
attention
i
have
often
contrasted
it
replied
he
with
the
manners
of
some
other
ladies
of
my
acquaintance
who
are
sometimes
of
our
quiet
evening
party
when
one
is
reading
history
or
any
ordinary
book
aloud
to
them
i
am
always
pleased
that
they
should
pursue
their
little
employments
it
amuses
themselves
and
gives
ease
and
familiarity
to
the
social
circle
but
while
i
have
been
reading
as
has
sometimes
happened
a
passage
of
the
highest
sublimity
or
most
tender
interest
i
own
i
feel
a
little
indignant
to
see
the
shuttle
plied
with
as
eager
assiduity
as
if
the
destinies
themselves
were
weaving
the
thread
i
have
known
a
lady
take
up
the
candlestick
to
search
for
her
in
the
midst
of
soliloquy
or
stoop
to
pick
up
her
scissors
while
hamlet
says
to
the
ghost
go
no
further
i
remember
another
who
would
whisper
across
the
table
to
borrow
thread
while
lear
has
been
raving
in
the
storm
or
macbeth
starting
at
the
spirit
of
banquo
and
make
signs
for
a
while
cardinal
beaufort
and
makes
no
sign
nay
once
i
remember
when
i
was
with
much
agitation
hurrying
through
the
gazette
of
the
battle
of
trafalgar
while
i
pronounced
almost
agonized
the
last
memorable
words
of
the
immortal
nelson
i
heard
one
lady
whisper
to
another
that
she
had
broken
her
needle
it
would
be
difficult
to
determine
replied
i
whether
this
inattention
most
betrays
want
of
sense
of
feeling
or
of
good
breeding
the
habit
of
attention
should
be
carefully
formed
in
early
life
and
then
the
mere
force
of
custom
would
teach
these
women
assume
the
virtue
if
they
have
it
not
the
family
at
the
grove
was
with
us
an
inexhaustible
topic
whenever
we
met
i
observed
to
sir
john
that
i
had
sometimes
noticed
in
charitable
families
a
display
a
bustle
a
kind
of
animal
restlessness
a
sort
of
mechanical
to
be
charitably
busy
that
though
they
fulfilled
conscientiously
one
part
of
the
apostolic
injunction
that
of
yet
they
failed
in
the
other
clause
that
of
doing
it
simplicity
yes
replied
he
i
visit
a
charitable
lady
in
town
who
almost
puts
me
out
of
love
with
benevolence
her
own
bounties
form
the
entire
subject
of
her
conversation
as
soon
as
the
breakfast
is
removed
the
table
is
regularly
covered
with
plans
and
proposals
and
subscription
papers
this
display
conveniently
performs
the
threefold
office
of
publishing
her
own
charities
furnishing
subjects
of
altercation
and
raising
contributions
on
the
visitor
her
narratives
really
cost
me
more
than
my
subscription
she
is
so
full
of
debate
and
detail
and
opposition
she
makes
you
read
so
many
papers
of
her
own
drawing
up
and
so
many
answers
to
the
schemes
of
other
people
and
she
has
so
many
objections
to
every
other
person
mode
of
doing
good
and
so
many
arguments
to
prove
that
her
own
is
the
best
that
she
appears
less
like
a
benevolent
lady
than
a
chicaning
attorney
nothing
said
i
corrects
this
bustling
bounty
so
completely
as
when
it
is
mixed
up
with
religion
i
should
rather
say
as
when
it
flows
from
religion
this
motive
so
far
from
diminishing
the
energy
augments
it
but
it
cures
the
display
and
converts
the
irritation
into
a
principle
it
transfers
the
activity
from
the
tongue
to
the
heart
it
is
the
only
sort
of
charity
which
twice
all
charity
indeed
blesses
the
receiver
but
the
blessing
promised
to
the
giver
i
have
sometimes
trembled
to
think
may
be
forfeited
even
by
a
generous
mind
from
ostentation
and
parade
in
the
manner
and
want
of
purity
in
the
motive
in
stanley
family
replied
he
in
a
more
serious
tone
i
have
met
with
a
complete
refutation
of
that
favorite
maxim
in
the
world
that
religion
is
a
dull
thing
itself
and
makes
its
professors
gloomy
and
morose
charles
i
have
often
frequented
houses
where
pleasure
was
the
avowed
object
of
idolatry
but
to
see
the
votaries
of
the
goddess
after
successive
nights
passed
in
her
temples
to
see
the
languor
the
listlessness
the
discontent
you
would
rather
have
taken
them
for
her
victims
than
her
worshipers
so
little
mental
vivacity
so
little
gayety
of
heart
in
short
after
no
careless
observations
i
am
compelled
to
declare
that
i
never
saw
two
forms
less
alike
than
those
of
pleasure
and
happiness
your
testimony
sir
john
said
i
is
of
great
weight
in
a
case
of
which
you
are
so
experienced
a
judge
what
a
different
scene
do
we
now
contemplate
stanley
seems
to
have
diffused
his
own
spirit
through
the
whole
family
what
makes
his
example
of
such
efficacy
is
that
he
considers
the
christian
as
so
considerable
a
part
of
christianity
this
temper
seems
to
imbue
his
whole
soul
pervade
his
whole
conduct
and
influence
his
whole
conversation
i
see
every
day
some
fresh
occasion
to
admire
his
candor
his
humility
his
constant
reference
not
as
a
topic
of
discourse
but
as
a
principle
of
conduct
to
the
gospel
as
the
standard
by
which
actions
are
to
be
weighed
his
conscientious
strictness
of
speech
his
serious
reproof
of
calumnies
his
charitable
construction
of
every
case
which
has
two
sides
simplicity
and
godly
sincerity
his
rule
of
referring
all
events
to
providential
direction
and
his
invariable
habit
of
vindicating
the
divine
goodness
under
dispensations
apparently
the
most
unfavorable
here
sir
john
left
me
and
i
could
not
forbear
pursuing
the
subject
in
soliloquy
as
i
proceeded
in
my
walk
i
reflected
with
admiration
that
stanley
in
his
religious
conversation
rendered
himself
so
useful
because
instead
of
the
uniform
nostrum
of
drop
and
the
he
applied
a
different
class
of
arguments
as
the
case
required
to
objectors
to
the
different
parts
of
christianity
to
ill
informed
persons
who
adopted
a
partial
gospel
without
understanding
it
as
a
scheme
or
embracing
it
as
a
whole
to
those
who
allow
its
truth
merely
on
the
same
ground
of
evidence
that
establishes
the
truth
of
any
other
well
authenticated
history
and
who
satisfied
with
this
external
evidence
not
only
do
not
feel
its
power
on
their
own
heart
but
deny
that
it
has
any
such
influence
on
the
hearts
of
others
to
those
who
believe
the
gospel
to
be
a
mere
code
of
ethics
to
their
antipodes
who
assert
that
christ
has
lowered
the
requisitions
of
the
law
to
lady
belfield
who
rests
on
her
charities
sir
john
on
his
correctness
lady
aston
on
her
austerities
to
this
man
who
values
himself
solely
on
the
stoutness
of
his
orthodoxy
to
another
on
the
firmness
of
his
integrity
to
a
third
on
the
peculiarities
of
his
party
he
addresses
himself
with
a
particular
view
to
their
individual
errors
this
he
does
with
such
a
discriminating
application
to
the
case
as
might
lead
the
to
suspect
that
he
was
not
equally
earnest
in
those
other
points
which
not
being
attacked
he
does
not
feel
himself
called
on
to
defend
but
which
had
they
been
attacked
he
would
then
have
defended
with
equal
zeal
as
relative
to
the
discussion
to
crown
all
i
contemplated
that
affectionate
warmth
of
heart
that
sympathizing
kindness
that
tenderness
of
feeling
of
which
the
gay
and
the
thoughtless
fancy
that
they
themselves
possess
the
monopoly
while
they
make
over
harshness
austerity
and
want
of
charity
to
religious
men
as
their
inseparable
characteristics
these
qualities
excite
in
my
heart
a
feeling
compounded
of
veneration
and
of
love
and
oh
how
impossible
it
is
even
in
religion
itself
to
be
disinterested
all
these
excellences
i
contemplate
with
a
more
heartfelt
delight
from
the
presumptuous
hope
that
i
may
one
day
have
the
felicity
of
connecting
myself
still
more
intimately
with
them
chapter
xxiii
some
days
after
while
we
were
conversing
over
our
tea
we
heard
the
noise
of
a
carriage
and
stanley
looking
out
from
a
bow
window
in
which
he
and
i
were
sitting
said
it
was
lady
and
miss
rattle
driving
up
the
avenue
he
had
just
time
to
add
these
are
our
neighbors
they
always
make
us
a
visit
as
soon
as
they
come
down
while
all
the
gloss
and
lustre
of
london
is
fresh
upon
them
we
have
always
our
regular
routine
of
conversation
while
her
ladyship
is
pouring
the
fashions
into
stanley
ear
miss
rattle
who
is
about
ph
oe
age
entertains
my
daughters
and
me
with
the
history
of
her
own
talents
and
acquirements
here
they
entered
after
a
few
compliments
lady
rattle
seated
herself
between
lady
belfield
and
stanley
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
while
the
fine
sprightly
boisterous
girl
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
threw
herself
back
on
the
sofa
at
nearly
her
full
length
between
stanley
and
me
the
miss
stanleys
and
sir
john
sitting
near
us
within
hearing
of
her
lively
loquacity
well
miss
amelia
said
stanley
i
dare
say
you
have
made
good
use
of
your
time
this
winter
i
suppose
you
have
ere
now
completed
the
whole
circle
of
the
arts
now
let
me
hear
what
you
have
been
doing
and
tell
me
your
whole
achievements
as
frankly
as
you
used
to
do
when
you
were
a
little
girl
indeed
replied
she
i
have
not
been
idle
if
i
must
speak
the
truth
one
has
so
many
things
to
learn
you
know
i
have
gone
on
with
my
french
and
italian
of
course
and
i
am
beginning
german
then
comes
my
he
teaches
me
to
paint
flowers
and
shells
and
to
draw
ruins
and
buildings
and
to
take
views
he
is
a
good
soul
and
is
finishing
a
set
of
pictures
and
half
a
dozen
which
i
began
for
mamma
he
help
me
to
be
sure
but
indeed
i
do
some
of
it
myself
do
i
mamma
calling
out
to
her
mother
who
was
too
much
absorbed
in
her
own
narratives
to
attend
to
her
daughter
and
then
pursued
the
young
prattler
i
learn
varnishing
and
gilding

and
mamma

a
better
fortune
than
lady
she
vows

then
i
have
a

another
who

leg
already
than
lady
di
then
i
have
a
and
another
who
teaches
me
the
harp
and
another
for
the
and
what
little
time
i

these
things
i

by
odd
minutes
to
ancient
and
modern
history
and
geography
and
astronomy
and
grammar
and
botany
then
i
attend
lectures
on
chemistry
and
experimental
philosophy
for
as
i
am
not
yet
come
out
i
have
not
much
to
do
in
the
evenings
and
mamma
says
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
that
money
can
pay
for
but
what
i
shall
learn
and
i
run
so
delightfully
fast
from
one
thing
to
another
that
i
am
never
tired
what
makes
it
so
pleasant
is
as
soon
as
i
am
fairly
set
in
with
one
master
another
arrives
i
should
hate
to
be
long
at
the
same
thing
but
i
have
a
great
while
to
work
so
hard
for
as
soon
as
i
come
out
i
shall
give
it
all
up
except
music
and
dancing
all
this
time
lucilla
sat
listening
with
a
smile
behind
the
complacency
of
which
she
tried
to
conceal
her
astonishment
ph
oe
be
who
had
less
was
on
the
very
verge
of
a
broad
laugh
sir
john
who
had
long
lived
in
a
soil
where
this
species
is
indigenous
had
been
too
long
accustomed
to
all
its
varieties
to
feel
much
astonishment
at
this
specimen
which
however
he
sat
contemplating
with
philosophical
but
discriminating
coolness
for
my
own
part
my
mind
was
wholly
absorbed
in
contrasting
the
coarse
manners
of
this
voluble
and
intrepid
but
girl
with
the
quiet
cheerful
and
unassuming
elegance
of
lucilla
i
should
be
afraid
miss
rattle
said
stanley
if
you
did
not
look
in
such
blooming
health
that
with
all
these
incessant
labors
you
did
not
allow
yourself
time
for
rest
surely
you
never
sleep
o
yes
that
i
do
and
eat
too
said
she
my
life
is
not
quite
so
hard
and
moping
as
you
fancy
what
between
shopping
and
morning
visits
with
mamma
and
seeing
sights
and
the
park
and
the
gardens
which
by
the
way
i
hate
except
on
a
sunday
when
they
are
crowded
and
our
young
balls
which
are
four
or
five
in
a
week
after
easter
and
mamma
music
parties
at
home
i
contrive
to
enjoy
myself
tolerably
though
after
i
have
been
presented
i
shall
be
a
thousand
times
better
off
for
then
i
have
a
moment
to
myself
wo
that
be
delightful
said
she
twitching
my
arm
rather
roughly
by
way
of
recalling
my
attention
which
however
had
seldom
wandered
as
she
had
now
run
out
her
london
materials
the
news
of
the
neighborhood
next
furnished
a
subject
for
her
volubility
after
she
had
mentioned
in
detail
one
or
two
stories
of
low
village
gossip
while
i
was
wondering
how
she
could
come
at
them
she
struck
me
dumb
by
quoting
the
coachman
as
her
authority
this
enigma
was
soon
explained
the
mother
and
daughter
having
exhausted
their
different
topics
of
discourse
nearly
at
the
same
time
they
took
their
leave
in
order
to
enrich
every
family
in
the
neighborhood
on
whom
they
were
going
to
call
with
the
same
valuable
knowledge
which
they
had
imparted
to
us
stanley
conducted
lady
rattle
and
i
led
her
daughter
but
as
i
offered
to
hand
her
into
the
carriage
she
started
back
with
a
sprightly
motion
and
screamed
out
o
no
not
in
the
inside
pray
help
me
up
to
the
i
always
protest
i
never
ride
with
any
body
but
the
coachman
if
we
go
ever
so
far
so
saying
with
a
spring
which
showed
how
much
she
despised
my
assistance
the
little
hoyden
was
seated
in
a
moment
nodding
familiarly
at
me
as
if
i
had
been
an
old
friend
then
with
a
voice
emulating
that
which
when
passing
by
charing
cross
i
have
heard
issue
from
an
vehicle
when
a
robust
sailor
has
thrust
his
body
out
at
the
window
the
fair
creature
vociferated
drive
on
coachman
he
obeyed
and
turning
round
her
whole
person
she
continued
nodding
at
me
till
they
were
out
of
sight
here
is
a
mass
of
accomplishments
said
i
without
one
particle
of
mind
one
ray
of
common
sense
or
one
shade
of
delicacy
surely
somewhat
less
time
and
less
money
might
have
sufficed
to
qualify
a
companion
for
the
coachman
what
poor
creatures
are
we
men
said
i
to
stanley
as
soon
as
he
came
in
we
think
it
very
well
if
after
much
labor
and
long
application
we
can
attain
to
one
or
two
of
the
innumerable
acquirements
of
this
gay
little
girl
nor
is
this
i
find
the
rare
achievement
of
one
happy
genius
there
is
a
whole
class
of
these
miraculous
females
miss
rattle
is
knight
of
the
shire
and
represents
them
all
it
is
only
young
ladies
replied
he
whose
vast
abilities
whose
mighty
grasp
of
mind
can
take
in
every
thing
among
men
learned
men
talents
are
commonly
directed
into
some
one
channel
and
fortunate
is
he
who
in
that
one
attains
to
excellence
the
linguist
is
rarely
a
painter
nor
is
the
mathematician
often
a
poet
even
in
one
profession
there
are
divisions
and
subdivisions
the
same
lawyer
never
thinks
of
presiding
both
in
the
king
bench
and
in
the
court
of
chancery
the
science
of
healing
is
not
only
divided
into
its
three
distinct
branches
but
in
the
profession
of
surgery
only
how
many
are
the
subdivisions
one
professor
undertakes
the
eye
another
the
ear
and
a
third
the
teeth
but
woman
ambitious
aspiring
universal
triumphant
glorious
woman
even
at
the
age
of
a
encounters
the
whole
range
of
arts
attacks
the
whole
circle
of
sciences
a
mighty
maze
and
without
a
plan
replied
sir
john
laughing
but
the
truth
is
the
misfortune
does
not
so
much
consist
in
their
learning
every
thing
as
in
their
knowing
nothing
i
mean
nothing
well
when
gold
is
beaten
out
so
wide
the
lamina
must
needs
be
very
thin
and
you
may
observe
the
more
valuable
attainments
though
they
are
not
to
be
left
out
of
the
modish
plan
are
kept
in
the
background
and
are
to
be
picked
up
out
of
the
odd
remnants
of
that
time
the
sum
of
which
is
devoted
to
frivolous
accomplishments
all
this
gay
confusion
of
acquirements
these
holiday
splendors
this
superfluity
of
enterprise
enumerated
in
the
first
part
of
her
catalogue
is
the
of
education
the
latter
part
is
incidental
and
if
taught
is
not
learned
as
to
the
lectures
so
boastfully
mentioned
they
may
doubtless
be
made
very
useful
subsidiaries
to
instruction
they
most
happily
illustrate
but
if
the
pupil
instructions
in
private
do
not
precede
and
keep
pace
with
these
useful
public
exhibitions
her
knowledge
will
be
only
presumptuous
ignorance
she
may
learn
to
talk
of
oxygen
and
hydrogen
and
deflagration
and
trituration
but
she
will
know
nothing
of
the
science
except
the
terms
it
is
not
knowing
the
name
of
his
tools
that
makes
an
artist
and
i
should
be
afraid
of
the
vanity
which
such
superficial
information
would
communicate
to
a
mind
not
previously
prepared
nor
exercised
at
home
in
corresponding
studies
but
as
miss
rattle
honestly
confessed
as
soon
as
she
all
these
things
will
die
away
of
themselves
and
dancing
and
music
will
be
almost
all
which
will
survive
of
her
multifarious
pursuits
i
look
upon
the
great
predominance
of
music
in
female
education
said
stanley
to
be
the
source
of
more
mischief
than
is
suspected
not
from
any
evil
in
the
thing
itself
but
from
its
being
such
a
gulf
of
time
as
really
to
leave
little
room
for
solid
acquisitions
i
love
music
and
were
it
only
cultivated
as
an
amusement
should
commend
it
but
the
monstrous
proportion
or
rather
disproportion
of
life
which
it
swallows
up
even
in
many
religious
families
and
this
is
the
chief
subject
of
my
regret
has
converted
an
innocent
diversion
into
a
positive
sin
i
question
if
many
gay
men
devote
more
hours
in
a
day
to
idle
purposes
than
the
daughters
of
many
pious
parents
spend
in
this
amusement
all
these
hours
the
mind
lies
fallow
improvement
is
at
a
stand
if
even
it
does
not
retrograde
nor
is
it
the
shreds
and
scraps
of
time
stolen
in
the
intervals
of
better
things
that
are
so
devoted
but
it
is
the
morning
the
prime
the
profitable
the
active
hours
when
the
mind
is
vigorous
the
spirits
light
the
intellect
awake
and
fresh
and
the
whole
being
wound
up
by
the
refreshment
of
sleep
and
animated
by
the
return
of
light
and
life
for
nobler
services
if
said
sir
john
music
were
cultivated
to
embellish
retirement
to
be
practiced
where
pleasures
are
scarce
and
good
performers
are
not
to
be
had
it
would
quite
alter
the
case
but
the
truth
is
these
highly
taught
ladies
are
not
only
living
in
public
where
they
constantly
hear
the
most
exquisite
professors
but
they
have
them
also
at
their
own
houses
now
one
of
these
two
things
must
happen
either
the
performance
of
the
lady
will
be
so
inferior
as
not
to
be
worth
hearing
on
the
comparison
or
so
good
that
she
will
fancy
herself
the
rival
instead
of
the
admirer
of
the
performer
whom
she
had
better
pay
and
praise
than
fruitlessly
emulate
this
anxious
struggle
to
reach
the
unattainable
excellence
of
the
professor
said
stanley
often
brings
to
my
mind
the
contest
for
victory
between
the
ambitious
nightingale
and
the
angry
lutanist
in
the
beautiful
prolusion
of
strada
it
is
to
the
predominance
of
this
talent
replied
i
that
i
ascribe
that
want
of
companionableness
of
which
i
complain
the
excellence
of
musical
performance
is
a
decorated
screen
behind
which
all
defects
in
domestic
knowledge
in
taste
judgment
and
literature
and
the
talents
which
make
an
elegant
companion
are
creditably
concealed
i
have
made
said
sir
john
another
remark
young
ladies
who
from
apparent
shyness
do
not
join
in
the
conversation
of
a
small
select
party
are
always
ready
enough
to
entertain
them
with
music
on
the
slightest
hint
surely
it
is
equally
modest
to
as
to
especially
to
sing
those
melting
strains
we
sometimes
hear
sung
and
which
we
should
be
ashamed
to
hear
said
after
all
how
few
hours
are
there
in
a
week
in
which
a
man
engaged
in
the
pursuits
of
life
and
a
woman
in
the
duties
of
a
family
wish
to
employ
in
music
i
am
fond
of
it
myself
and
lady
belfield
plays
admirably
but
with
the
cares
inseparable
from
the
conscientious
discharge
of
her
duty
with
so
many
children
how
little
time
has
she
to
play
or
i
to
listen
but
there
is
no
day
no
hour
no
meal
in
which
i
do
not
enjoy
in
her
the
ever
ready
pleasure
of
an
elegant
and
interesting
companion
a
man
of
sense
when
all
goes
smoothly
wants
to
be
entertained
under
vexation
to
be
soothed
in
difficulties
to
be
counseled
in
sorrow
to
be
comforted
in
a
mere
artist
can
he
reasonably
look
for
these
resources
only
figure
to
yourself
replied
stanley
my
six
girls
daily
playing
their
four
hours
a
piece
which
is
now
a
moderate
allowance
as
we
have
but
one
instrument
they
must
be
at
it
in
succession
day
and
night
to
keep
pace
with
their
neighbors
if
i
may
compare
light
things
with
serious
ones
it
would
resemble
added
he
smiling
the
perpetual
psalmody
of
good
nicholars
ferrar
who
had
relays
of
musicians
every
six
hours
to
sing
the
whole
psalter
through
every
day
and
night
i
mean
not
to
ridicule
that
holy
man
but
my
girls
thus
keeping
their
useless
vigils
in
turn
we
should
only
have
the
melody
without
any
of
the
piety
no
my
friend
i
will
have
but
two
or
three
singing
birds
to
cheer
my
little
grove
if
all
the
world
are
performers
there
will
soon
be
no
hearers
now
as
i
am
resolved
in
my
own
family
that
some
shall
listen
i
will
have
but
few
to
perform
it
must
be
confessed
said
sir
john
that
miss
rattle
is
no
servile
imitator
of
the
vapid
tribe
of
the
superficially
accomplished
her
violent
animal
spirits
prevent
her
from
growing
smooth
by
attrition
she
is
as
rough
and
angular
as
rusticity
itself
could
have
made
her
where
strength
of
character
however
is
only
marked
by
the
worst
concomitant
of
strength
which
is
coarseness
i
should
almost
prefer
inanity
itself
i
should
a
little
fear
said
i
that
i
lay
too
much
stress
on
companionableness
on
the
duty
of
being
agreeable
at
had
i
not
early
learned
the
doctrine
from
my
father
and
seen
it
exemplified
so
happy
in
the
practice
of
my
mother
i
entirely
agree
with
you
charles
said
stanley
as
to
the
absolute
of
being
agreeable
and
even
entertaining
in
own
family
circle
nothing
so
soon
and
so
certainly
wears
out
the
happiness
of
married
persons
as
that
too
common
bad
effect
of
familiarity
the
sinking
down
into
dullness
and
insipidity
neglecting
to
keep
alive
the
flame
by
the
delicacy
which
first
kindled
it
want
of
vigilance
in
keeping
the
temper
cheerful
by
christian
discipline
and
the
faculties
bright
by
constant
use
mutual
affection
decays
of
itself
even
where
there
is
no
great
moral
turpitude
without
mutual
endeavors
not
only
to
improve
but
to
amuse
this
continued
he
is
one
of
the
great
arts
of
that
it
is
so
little
practiced
accounts
in
a
good
measure
for
the
undomestic
turn
of
too
many
married
persons
the
man
meets
abroad
with
amusements
and
the
woman
with
attentions
to
which
they
are
not
accustomed
at
home
whereas
a
capacity
to
please
on
the
one
part
and
a
disposition
to
be
pleased
on
the
other
in
their
own
house
would
make
most
visits
appear
dull
but
then
the
disposition
and
the
capacity
must
be
cultivated
antecedently
to
marriage
a
woman
whose
whole
education
has
been
rehearsal
will
always
be
dull
except
she
lives
on
the
stage
constantly
displaying
what
she
has
been
sedulously
acquiring
books
on
the
contrary
well
chosen
books
do
not
lead
to
exhibition
the
knowledge
a
woman
acquires
in
private
desires
no
witnesses
the
possession
is
the
pleasure
it
improves
herself
it
embellishes
her
family
society
it
entertains
her
husband
it
informs
her
children
the
gratification
is
cheap
is
safe
is
always
to
be
had
at
home
it
is
superfluous
said
sir
john
to
decorate
women
so
highly
for
early
youth
youth
is
itself
a
decoration
we
mistakingly
adorn
most
that
part
of
life
which
least
requires
it
and
neglect
to
provide
for
that
which
will
want
it
most
it
is
for
that
sober
period
when
life
has
lost
its
freshness
the
passions
their
intenseness
and
the
spirits
their
hilarity
that
we
should
be
preparing
our
wisdom
would
be
to
anticipate
the
wants
of
middle
life
to
lay
in
a
store
of
notions
ideas
principles
and
habits
which
may
preserve
or
transfer
to
the
mind
that
affection
which
was
at
first
partly
attracted
by
the
person
but
to
add
a
vacant
mind
to
a
form
which
has
ceased
to
please
to
provide
no
subsidiary
aid
to
beauty
while
it
lasts
and
especially
no
substitute
when
it
is
departed
is
to
render
life
comfortless
and
marriage
dreary
the
reading
of
a
cultivated
woman
said
stanley
commonly
occupies
less
time
than
the
music
of
a
musical
woman
or
the
idleness
of
an
indolent
woman
or
the
dress
of
a
vain
woman
or
the
dissipation
of
a
fluttering
woman
she
is
therefore
likely
to
have
more
leisure
for
her
duties
as
well
as
more
inclination
and
a
sounder
judgment
for
performing
them
but
pray
observe
that
i
assume
my
reading
woman
to
be
a
religious
woman
and
i
will
not
answer
for
the
effect
of
a
literary
vanity
more
than
for
that
of
any
other
vanity
in
a
mind
not
habitually
disciplined
by
christian
principle
the
only
safe
and
infallible
antidote
for
knowledge
of
every
kind
before
we
had
finished
our
conversation
we
were
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
the
post
sir
john
eagerly
opened
the
newspaper
but
instead
of
gratifying
our
impatience
with
the
intelligence
for
which
we
panted
from
the
glorious
spaniards
he
read
a
paragraph
which
stated
that
miss
denham
had
eloped
with
signor
squallini
that
they
were
on
their
way
to
scotland
and
that
lady
denham
had
been
in
fits
ever
since
lady
belfield
with
her
usual
kindness
was
beginning
to
express
how
much
she
pitied
her
old
acquaintance
my
dear
caroline
said
sir
john
there
is
too
much
substantial
and
inevitable
misery
in
the
world
for
you
to
waste
much
compassion
on
this
foolish
woman
lady
denham
has
little
reason
to
be
surprised
at
an
event
which
all
reasonable
people
must
have
anticipated
provoking
and
disgraceful
as
it
is
what
has
she
to
blame
but
her
own
infatuation
this
italian
was
the
associate
of
all
her
pleasures
the
constant
theme
of
her
admiration
he
was
admitted
when
her
friends
were
excluded
the
girl
was
continually
hearing
that
music
was
the
best
gift
and
that
signor
squallini
was
the
best
gifted
miss
denham
added
he
laughing
had
more
wit
than
your
nightingale
instead
of
dropping
down
dead
on
the
lute
for
envy
she
thought
it
better
to
run
away
with
the
lutanist
for
love
i
pity
the
poor
girl
however
who
has
furnished
such
a
commentary
to
our
text
and
who
is
rather
the
victim
of
a
wretched
education
than
of
her
own
bad
propensities
chapter
xxiv
i
had
generally
found
that
a
sunday
passed
in
a
visit
was
so
heavy
a
day
that
i
had
been
accustomed
so
to
arrange
my
engagements
as
commonly
to
exclude
this
from
the
days
spent
from
home
i
had
often
found
that
even
where
the
week
had
been
pleasantly
occupied
the
necessity
of
passing
several
hours
of
a
season
peculiarly
designed
for
religious
purposes
with
people
whose
habits
have
little
similarity
with
our
own
either
draws
one
into
their
relaxed
mode
of
getting
rid
of
the
day
or
drives
one
to
a
retirement
which
having
an
unsociable
appearance
is
liable
to
the
reproach
of
austerity
and
gloom
the
case
was
quite
different
at
stanley
grove
the
seriousness
was
without
severity
and
the
cheerfulness
had
no
mixture
of
levity
the
family
seemed
more
than
usually
animated
and
there
was
a
variety
in
the
religious
pursuits
of
the
young
people
enlivened
by
intervals
of
cheerful
and
improving
conversation
which
particularly
struck
lady
belfield
she
observed
to
me
that
the
difficulty
of
getting
through
the
sunday
without
any
mixture
of
worldly
occupations
or
amusements
on
the
one
hand
or
of
disgust
and
weariness
on
the
other
was
among
the
many
right
things
which
she
had
never
been
able
to
accomplish
in
her
own
family
as
we
walked
from
church
one
sunday
miss
stanley
told
me
that
her
father
does
not
approve
the
habit
of
criticising
the
sermon
he
says
that
the
custom
of
pointing
out
the
faults
can
not
be
maintained
without
the
custom
of
watching
for
them
that
it
gives
the
attention
a
wrong
turn
and
leads
the
hearer
only
to
treasure
up
such
passages
as
may
serve
for
animadversion
and
a
display
not
of
christian
temper
but
of
critical
skill
if
the
general
tenor
and
principle
be
right
that
is
the
main
point
they
are
to
look
to
and
not
to
hunt
for
philosophical
errors
that
the
hearer
would
do
well
to
observe
whether
it
is
not
he
that
sleeps
as
often
at
least
as
homer
nods
a
remark
exemplified
at
church
as
often
as
on
the
occasion
which
suggested
it
that
a
critical
spirit
is
the
worst
that
can
be
brought
out
of
church
being
a
symptom
of
an
unhumbled
mind
and
an
evidence
that
whatever
the
sermon
may
have
done
for
others
it
has
not
benefited
the
caviler
here
stanley
joined
us
i
found
he
did
not
encourage
his
family
to
take
down
the
sermon
it
is
no
disparagement
said
he
to
the
discourse
preached
to
presume
that
there
may
be
as
good
already
printed
why
therefore
not
read
the
printed
sermon
at
home
in
the
evening
instead
of
that
by
which
you
ought
to
have
been
improving
while
it
was
delivering
if
it
be
true
that
cometh
by
an
inferior
sermon
warm
and
instant
from
the
heart
assisted
by
all
the
surrounding
solemnities
which
make
a
sermon
so
different
from
one
may
strike
more
forcibly
than
an
abler
discourse
coolly
perused
at
home
in
writing
the
mechanical
act
must
necessarily
lessen
the
effect
to
the
writer
and
to
the
spectator
it
diminishes
the
dignity
of
the
scene
and
seems
like
writer
taking
down
a
trial
but
that
my
daughters
may
not
plead
this
as
an
excuse
for
inattention
continued
he
i
make
it
a
part
of
their
evening
duty
to
repeat
what
they
retain
separately
to
me
in
my
library
the
consciousness
that
this
repetition
will
be
required
of
them
stimulates
their
diligence
and
the
exercise
itself
not
only
strengthens
the
memory
but
habituates
to
serious
reflection
at
tea
ph
oe
be
a
charming
creature
but
who
now
and
then
carried
away
by
the
impulse
of
the
moment
forgets
habits
and
prohibitions
said
i
think
papa
barlow
was
rather
dull
there
was
nothing
new
in
the
sermon
my
dear
replied
her
father
we
do
not
go
to
church
to
hear
news
christianity
is
no
novelty
and
though
it
is
true
that
we
go
to
be
instructed
yet
we
require
to
be
reminded
full
as
much
as
to
be
taught
general
truths
are
what
we
all
acknowledge
and
all
forget
we
acknowledge
them
because
a
general
assent
of
the
understanding
costs
but
little
and
we
forget
them
because
the
remembrance
would
force
upon
the
conscience
a
great
deal
of
practical
labor
to
believe
and
remember
and
act
upon
common
undisputed
general
truths
is
the
most
important
part
of
religion
this
though
in
fact
very
difficult
is
overlooked
on
account
of
its
being
supposed
very
easy
to
keep
up
in
the
heart
a
lively
impression
of
a
few
plain
momentous
truths
is
of
more
use
than
the
ablest
discussion
of
a
hundred
controverted
points
now
tell
me
ph
oe
be
do
you
really
think
that
you
have
remembered
and
practiced
all
the
instructions
you
have
received
from
sermons
last
year
if
you
have
though
you
will
have
a
better
right
to
be
critical
you
will
be
less
disposed
to
be
so
if
you
have
not
do
not
complain
that
the
sermon
is
not
new
till
you
have
made
all
possible
use
of
the
old
ones
which
if
you
had
done
you
would
have
acquired
so
much
humility
that
you
would
meekly
listen
even
to
what
you
already
know
but
however
the
discourse
may
have
been
superfluous
to
such
deep
divines
as
miss
ph
oe
be
stanley
it
will
be
very
useful
to
me
and
to
other
hearers
who
are
not
so
wise
poor
ph
oe
be
blushed
up
to
her
ears
tears
rushed
into
her
eyes
she
was
so
overcome
with
shame
that
regardless
of
the
company
she
flew
into
her
father
arms
and
softly
whispered
that
if
he
would
forgive
her
foolish
vanity
she
would
never
again
be
above
being
taught
the
fond
but
not
blind
father
withdrew
with
her
lucilla
followed
with
looks
of
anxious
love
during
their
short
absence
stanley
said
lucilla
is
so
practically
aware
of
the
truth
of
her
father
observation
that
she
often
says
she
finds
as
much
advantage
as
pleasure
in
teaching
the
children
at
her
school
this
elementary
instruction
obliges
her
continually
to
recur
to
first
principles
and
to
keep
constantly
uppermost
in
her
mind
those
great
truths
contained
in
the
articles
of
our
belief
the
commandments
and
the
prayer
taught
by
our
redeemer
this
perpetual
simplifying
of
religion
she
assures
me
keeps
her
more
humble
fixes
her
attention
on
fundamental
truths
and
makes
her
more
indifferent
to
controverted
points
in
a
few
minutes
stanley
and
his
daughters
returned
cheerful
and
happy
lucilla
smiling
like
the
angel
of
peace
and
love
if
i
were
not
afraid
said
lady
belfield
of
falling
under
the
same
censure
with
my
friend
ph
oe
be
smiling
on
the
sweet
girl
i
should
venture
to
say
that
i
thought
the
sermon
rather
too
severe
do
not
be
afraid
madam
replied
stanley
though
i
disapprove
that
cheap
and
cruel
criticism
which
makes
a
man
offender
for
a
yet
discussion
does
not
necessarily
involve
censoriousness
so
far
from
it
it
is
fair
to
discuss
whatever
seems
to
be
doubtful
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
hear
your
ladyship
objections
well
then
replied
she
in
the
most
modest
tone
and
accent
with
all
my
reverence
for
barlow
i
thought
him
a
little
unreasonable
in
seeming
to
expect
universal
goodness
from
creatures
whom
he
yet
insisted
were
fallen
creatures
perhaps
madam
said
stanley
you
mistook
his
meaning
for
he
appeared
to
me
perfectly
consistent
not
only
with
himself
but
with
his
invariable
rule
and
guide
the
scriptures
sanctification
will
you
allow
me
to
use
so
serious
a
word
however
imperfect
must
be
universal
it
is
not
the
improvement
of
any
one
faculty
or
quality
or
temper
which
divines
mean
when
they
say
we
are
renewed
in
part
so
much
as
that
the
change
is
not
perfect
the
holiness
is
not
complete
in
part
or
power
or
faculty
though
progressive
in
all
he
who
earnestly
desires
a
universal
victory
over
sin
knows
which
of
his
evil
dispositions
or
affections
it
is
that
is
yet
unsubdued
this
rebellious
enemy
he
vigilantly
sets
himself
to
watch
against
to
struggle
with
and
through
divine
grace
to
conquer
the
test
of
his
sincerity
does
not
so
much
consist
in
avoiding
many
faults
to
which
he
has
no
temptation
as
in
conquering
that
one
to
which
his
natural
bent
and
bias
forcibly
impel
him
lady
belfield
said
but
is
it
not
impossible
to
bring
every
part
of
our
nature
under
this
absolute
dominion
suppose
a
man
is
very
passionate
and
yet
very
charitable
would
you
look
upon
that
person
to
be
in
a
dangerous
state
it
is
not
my
province
madam
to
decide
replied
stanley
as
bishop
sanderson
says
this
to
himself
of
being
the
searcher
of
hearts
i
can
not
judge
how
far
he
resists
anger
nor
what
are
his
secret
struggles
against
it
god
who
expects
not
perfection
expects
sincerity
though
complete
unmixed
goodness
is
not
to
be
attained
in
this
imperfect
state
yet
the
earnest
desire
after
it
is
the
only
sure
criterion
of
the
sincerity
we
profess
if
the
man
you
allude
to
does
not
watch
and
pray
and
strive
against
the
passion
of
anger
which
is
his
natural
infirmity
i
should
doubt
whether
any
of
his
affections
were
really
renewed
and
i
should
fear
that
his
charity
was
rather
a
mere
habitual
feeling
though
a
most
amiable
one
than
a
christian
grace
he
indulges
in
charity
because
it
is
a
constitutional
bias
and
costs
him
nothing
he
indulges
in
passion
because
it
is
a
natural
bias
also
and
to
set
about
a
victory
over
it
would
cost
him
a
great
deal
this
should
put
him
on
a
strict
when
he
would
probably
find
that
while
he
gives
the
uncontrolled
reins
to
any
one
wrong
inclination
his
religion
even
when
he
does
right
things
is
questionable
true
religion
is
seated
in
the
heart
that
is
the
centre
from
which
all
the
lines
of
right
practice
must
diverge
it
is
the
great
duty
and
chief
business
of
a
christian
to
labor
to
make
all
his
affections
with
all
their
motives
tendencies
and
operations
subservient
to
the
word
and
will
of
god
his
irregular
passions
which
are
still
apt
to
start
out
into
disorder
will
require
vigilance
to
the
end
he
must
not
think
all
is
safe
because
the
more
tractable
ones
are
not
rebellious
but
he
may
entertain
a
cheerful
hope
when
those
which
were
once
rebellious
are
become
tractable
i
feel
the
importance
of
what
you
say
returned
lady
belfield
but
i
feel
also
my
utter
inability
to
set
about
it
my
dear
madam
said
stanley
this
is
the
best
and
most
salutary
feeling
you
can
have
that
very
consciousness
of
insufficiency
will
i
trust
drive
you
to
the
fountain
of
all
strength
and
power
it
will
quicken
your
faith
and
animate
your
prayer
faith
which
is
the
habitual
principle
of
confidence
in
god
and
prayer
which
is
the
exercise
of
that
principle
toward
him
who
is
the
object
of
it
but
barlow
said
lady
belfield
was
so
discouraging
he
seemed
to
intimate
as
if
the
conflict
of
a
christian
with
sin
must
be
as
lasting
as
his
life
whereas
i
had
hoped
that
victory
once
obtained
was
obtained
forever
the
replied
stanley
is
only
the
entrance
of
religion
the
is
a
continued
course
the
christian
life
my
dear
lady
belfield
is
not
a
point
but
a
progress
it
is
precisely
in
the
race
of
christianity
as
in
the
race
of
human
glory
julius
cæsar
and
paul
describe
their
respective
warfares
in
nearly
the
same
terms
should
count
nothing
done
while
any
thing
remains
says
the
warrior
counting
myself
to
have
attained
forgetting
the
things
which
are
behind
and
pressing
forward
to
those
which
are
says
the
apostle
and
it
is
worth
remarking
that
they
both
made
the
disqualifying
observation
after
attainments
almost
incredible
as
there
was
no
being
a
hero
by
any
idler
way
so
there
is
no
being
a
christian
by
any
easier
road
the
necessity
of
pursuit
is
the
same
in
both
cases
though
the
objects
pursued
differ
as
widely
as
the
vanities
of
time
from
the
riches
of
eternity
footnote
nil

dum

do
not
think
my
dear
madam
added
stanley
that
i
am
erecting
myself
into
a
censor
much
less
into
a
model
the
corruptions
which
i
lament
i
participate
the
deficiencies
which
i
deplore
i
feel
not
only
when
i
look
abroad
am
i
persuaded
of
the
general
prevalence
of
evil
by
what
i
see
but
when
i
look
into
my
own
heart
my
conviction
is
confirmed
by
what
i
experience
i
am
conscious
not
merely
of
frailties
but
of
sins
i
will
not
hypocritically
accuse
myself
of
gross
offenses
which
i
have
no
temptation
to
commit
and
from
the
commission
of
which
motives
inferior
to
religion
would
preserve
me
but
i
am
continually
humbled
in
detecting
mixed
motives
in
almost
all
i
do
such
strugglings
of
pride
with
my
endeavors
after
humility
such
irresolution
in
my
firmest
purposes
so
much
imperfection
in
my
best
actions
so
much
want
of
simplicity
in
my
purest
designs
such
fresh
shoots
of
selfishness
where
i
had
hoped
the
plant
itself
had
been
eradicated
such
frequent
deadness
in
duty
such
coldness
in
my
affections
such
infirmity
of
will
such
proneness
to
earth
in
my
highest
aspirations
after
heaven
all
these
you
see
would
hardly
make
in
the
eyes
of
those
who
want
christian
discernment
very
gross
sins
yet
they
prove
demonstrably
the
root
of
sin
in
the
heart
and
the
infection
of
nature
tainting
my
best
resolves
the
true
christian
said
i
when
stanley
had
done
speaking
extracts
humility
from
the
very
circumstance
which
raises
pride
in
the
irreligious
the
sight
of
any
enormity
in
another
makes
the
mere
moralist
proud
that
he
is
exempt
from
it
while
the
religious
man
is
humbled
from
a
view
of
the
sinfulness
of
that
nature
he
partakes
a
nature
which
admits
of
such
excesses
and
from
which
excesses
he
knows
that
he
himself
is
preserved
by
divine
grace
alone
i
have
often
observed
that
comparison
is
the
aliment
of
pride
in
the
worldly
man
and
of
in
the
christian
poor
lady
belfield
looked
comforted
on
finding
that
her
friend
stanley
was
not
quite
so
perfect
as
she
had
feared
happy
are
those
exclaimed
she
looking
at
lucilla
the
innocence
of
whose
lives
recommends
them
to
the
divine
favor
innocence
replied
stanley
can
never
be
pleaded
as
a
ground
of
acceptance
because
the
thing
does
not
exist
innocence
excludes
the
necessity
of
repentance
and
where
there
is
no
sin
there
can
be
no
need
of
a
saviour
whatever
therefore
we
may
be
in
comparison
with
others
innocence
can
afford
no
plea
for
our
acceptance
without
annulling
the
great
plan
of
our
redemption
one
thing
puzzles
me
said
lady
belfield
the
most
worthless
people
i
converse
with
deny
the
doctrine
of
human
corruption
a
doctrine
the
truth
of
which
one
should
suppose
their
own
feelings
must
confirm
while
those
few
excellent
persons
who
almost
seem
to
have
escaped
it
insist
the
most
peremptorily
on
its
reality
but
if
it
be
really
true
surely
the
mercies
of
god
are
so
great
that
he
will
overlook
the
frailties
of
such
weak
and
erring
mortals
so
gracious
a
saviour
will
not
exact
such
rigorous
obedience
from
creatures
so
infirm
let
not
what
i
am
going
to
say
my
dear
lady
belfield
replied
stanley
offend
you
the
correctness
of
your
conduct
exempts
you
from
any
particular
application
but
there
are
too
many
christians
who
while
they
speak
with
reverence
of
christ
as
the
saviour
of
sinners
do
not
enough
consider
him
as
a
deliverer
from
sin
they
regard
him
rather
as
having
lowered
the
requisitions
of
the
law
and
exonerated
his
followers
from
the
necessity
of
that
strictness
of
life
which
they
view
as
a
burdensome
part
of
religion
from
this
burden
they
flatter
themselves
it
was
the
chief
object
of
the
gospel
to
deliver
them
and
from
this
supposed
deliverance
it
is
that
they
chiefly
consider
it
a
merciful
dispensation
a
cheap
christianity
of
which
we
can
acquit
ourselves
by
a
general
recognition
and
a
few
stated
observances
which
requires
no
sacrifices
of
the
will
nor
rectification
of
the
life
is
i
assure
you
the
prevailing
system
the
religion
of
that
numerous
class
who
like
to
save
appearances
and
to
decline
realities
who
expect
every
thing
hereafter
while
they
resolve
to
give
up
nothing
here
but
who
keep
heaven
in
view
as
a
snug
reversion
after
they
shall
have
squeezed
out
of
this
world
to
the
very
last
dregs
and
droppings
all
it
has
to
give
lady
belfield
with
great
modesty
replied
indeed
i
am
ashamed
to
have
said
so
much
upon
a
topic
on
which
i
am
unable
and
unused
to
debate
sir
john
only
smiles
and
looks
resolved
not
to
help
me
out
believe
me
however
my
dear
sir
that
what
i
have
said
proceeds
not
from
presumption
but
from
an
earnest
desire
of
being
set
right
i
will
only
venture
to
offer
one
more
observation
on
the
afternoon
sermon
barlow
to
my
great
surprise
spoke
of
the
death
of
christ
as
exhibiting
lessons
now
though
i
have
always
considered
it
in
a
general
way
as
the
cause
of
our
salvation
yet
its
preceptive
and
moral
benefits
i
must
confess
do
not
appear
to
me
at
all
obvious
i
conceive
replied
stanley
our
deliverance
from
the
punishment
incurred
by
sin
to
be
one
great
end
and
object
of
the
death
of
our
redeemer
but
i
am
very
far
from
considering
this
as
the
only
benefit
attending
it
i
conceive
it
to
be
most
abundant
in
instruction
and
the
strongest
possible
incentive
to
practical
goodness
and
that
in
a
great
variety
of
ways
the
death
of
our
redeemer
shows
us
the
infinite
value
of
our
souls
by
showing
the
inestimable
price
paid
for
them
and
thus
leads
us
to
more
diligence
in
securing
their
eternal
felicity
it
is
calculated
to
inspire
us
with
an
unfeigned
hatred
of
sin
and
more
especially
to
convince
us
of
god
hatred
to
that
for
the
pardon
of
which
such
a
sacrifice
was
deemed
necessary
now
if
it
actually
produce
such
an
effect
it
consequently
stimulates
us
to
repentance
and
to
an
increasing
dread
of
violating
those
engagements
which
we
have
so
often
made
to
lead
a
better
life
then
the
contemplation
of
this
stupendous
circumstance
will
tend
to
fill
our
hearts
with
such
a
sense
of
gratitude
and
obedience
as
will
be
likely
to
preserve
us
from
relapsing
into
fresh
offenses
again
can
any
motive
operate
so
powerfully
on
us
toward
producing
universal
charity
and
forgiveness
whatever
promotes
our
love
to
god
will
dispose
us
to
an
increased
love
for
our
we
can
not
converse
with
any
man
we
can
not
receive
a
kindness
from
any
man
nay
we
can
not
receive
an
injury
from
any
man
for
whom
the
redeemer
has
not
died
the
remembrance
of
the
sufferings
which
procured
pardon
for
the
greatest
offenses
has
a
natural
tendency
to
lead
us
to
forgive
small
ones
lady
belfield
said
i
had
not
indeed
imagined
there
were
any
practical
uses
in
an
event
to
which
i
had
been
however
accustomed
to
look
with
reverence
as
an
atonement
for
sin
of
these
practical
effects
replied
stanley
i
will
only
further
observe
that
all
human
considerations
put
together
can
not
so
powerfully
inspire
us
with
an
indifference
to
the
vanities
of
life
and
the
allurements
of
unhallowed
pleasures
no
human
motive
can
be
so
efficacious
in
sustaining
the
heart
under
trials
and
reconciling
it
to
afflictions
for
what
trials
and
afflictions
do
not
sink
into
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
sufferings
attending
that
august
event
from
which
we
derive
this
support
the
contemplation
of
this
sacrifice
also
degrades
wealth
debases
power
annihilates
ambition
we
rise
from
this
contemplation
with
a
mind
prepared
to
bear
with
the
infirmities
to
relieve
the
wants
to
forgive
the
unkindnesses
of
men
we
extract
from
it
a
more
humbling
sense
of
ourselves
a
more
subdued
spirit
a
more
sober
contempt
of
whatever
the
world
calls
great
than
all
the
lectures
of
ancient
philosophy
or
the
teachers
of
modern
morals
ever
inspired
during
this
little
debate
sir
john
maintained
the
most
invincible
silence
his
countenance
bore
not
the
least
mark
of
or
impatience
but
it
was
serious
and
thoughtful
except
when
his
wife
got
into
any
little
difficulty
he
then
encouraged
her
by
an
affectionate
smile
but
listened
like
a
man
who
has
not
quite
made
up
his
mind
yet
thinks
the
subject
too
important
to
be
dismissed
without
a
fair
and
candid
hearing
chapter
xxv
while
we
were
at
breakfast
the
next
morning
a
sweet
little
gay
girl
flew
into
the
room
almost
breathless
with
joy
and
running
to
her
mother
presented
her
with
a
beautiful
nosegay
o
i
see
you
were
the
industrious
girl
last
week
kate
said
stanley
embracing
her
and
admiring
the
flowers
lady
belfield
looked
inquisitively
it
is
an
invention
of
lucilla
said
the
mother
that
the
little
one
who
performs
best
in
the
instead
of
having
any
reward
which
may
excite
vanity
or
sensuality
shall
be
taught
to
gratify
a
better
feeling
by
being
allowed
to
present
her
mother
with
a
nosegay
of
the
finest
flowers
which
it
is
reward
enough
to
see
worn
at
dinner
to
which
she
is
always
admitted
when
there
is
no
company
oh
pray
do
not
consider
us
as
company
pray
let
kate
dine
with
us
said
lady
belfield
stanley
bowed
her
assent
and
went
on
but
this
is
not
all
the
flowers
they
present
they
also
raise
i
went
rather
too
far
when
i
said
that
no
vanity
was
excited
they
are
vain
enough
of
their
carnations
and
each
is
eager
to
produce
the
largest
in
this
competition
however
the
vanity
is
not
personal
lucilla
has
some
skill
in
raising
flowers
each
girl
has
a
subordinate
post
under
her
their
father
often
treats
them
with
half
a
day
work
and
then
they
all
treat
me
with
tea
and
cakes
in
the
arbor
of
their
own
planting
which
is
called
lucilla
bower
it
would
be
hard
to
say
whether
parents
or
children
most
enjoy
these
happy
holidays
at
dinner
stanley
appeared
with
her
nosegay
in
a
large
knot
of
ribbons
which
was
eyed
with
no
small
complacency
by
little
kate
i
observed
that
lucilla
who
used
to
manifest
much
pleasure
in
the
conversation
after
dinner
was
beckoned
out
of
the
room
by
ph
oe
be
as
soon
as
it
was
over
i
felt
uneasy
at
an
absence
to
which
i
had
not
been
accustomed
but
the
cause
was
explained
when
at
six
kate
who
was
the
queen
of
the
day
was
sent
to
invite
us
to
drink
tea
in
lucilla
bower
we
instantly
obeyed
the
summons
i
knew
nothing
of
this
said
the
delighted
mother
while
we
were
all
admiring
the
elegant
arrangements
of
this
little
fête
the
purple
clematis
twisting
its
flexile
branches
with
those
of
the
pale
woodbine
formed
a
sweet
and
fragrant
canopy
to
the
arched
bower
while
the
flowery
tendrils
hung
down
on
all
sides
large
bunches
of
roses
intermixed
with
the
silver
stars
of
the
jessamine
were
stuck
into
the
moss
on
the
inside
as
a
temporary
decoration
only
the
finest
plants
had
been
brought
from
the
for
the
occasion
it
was
a
delicious
evening
and
the
little
fairy
festivity
together
with
the
flitting
about
of
the
airy
spirits
which
had
prepared
it
was
absolutely
enchanting
sir
john
always
poetical
exclaimed
in
rapture
hesperian
fables
true
if
true
here
only
i
needed
not
this
quotation
to
bring
the
garden
of
eden
to
my
mind
for
lucilla
presided
ph
oe
be
was
all
alive
the
other
little
ones
had
decorated
kate
flaxen
hair
with
a
wreath
of
woodbines
they
sung
two
or
three
baby
stanzas
which
they
had
composed
among
themselves
in
which
kate
was
complimented
as
queen
of
the
fête
the
youngest
daughter
of
lady
aston
who
was
about
kate
age
and
two
little
girls
of
barlow
were
of
the
children
party
on
the
green
the
elder
sisters
of
both
families
made
part
of
the
company
within
when
we
were
all
seated
in
our
enchanting
bower
and
drinking
our
tea
at
which
we
had
no
other
attendants
than
the
little
hebes
themselves
i
asked
kate
how
it
happened
that
she
seemed
to
be
distinguished
on
this
occasion
from
her
little
sisters
oh
sir
said
she
it
is
because
it
is
my
i
am
eight
years
old
i
gave
up
all
my
gilt
books
with
pictures
this
day
twelvemonth
and
i
give
up
all
my
little
story
books
and
i
am
now
going
to
read
such
books
as
men
and
women
read
she
then
ran
to
her
companions
who
ranged
themselves
round
a
turf
seat
at
a
little
distance
before
us
to
which
were
transferred
a
profusion
of
cakes
and
fruit
from
the
bower
while
they
were
devouring
them
i
turned
to
stanley
and
desired
an
explanation
of
kate
speech
i
make
said
he
the
renouncing
their
baby
books
a
kind
of
epocha
and
by
thus
distinctly
marking
the
period
they
never
think
of
returning
back
to
them
we
have
in
our
domestic
plan
several
of
these
artificial
divisions
of
life
these
little
celebrations
are
eras
that
we
use
as
from
which
we
set
out
on
some
new
course
but
as
to
kate
books
said
lady
belfield
we
have
replied
stanley
too
many
elementary
books
they
are
read
too
much
and
too
long
the
youthful
mind
which
was
formerly
sick
from
inanition
is
now
in
danger
from
a
plethora
much
however
will
depend
on
capacity
and
disposition
a
child
of
slower
parts
may
be
indulged
till
nine
years
old
with
books
which
a
lively
genius
will
look
down
upon
at
seven
a
girl
of
talents
read
to
no
excitement
is
wanting
the
natural
appetite
is
a
sufficient
incentive
the
less
brilliant
child
requires
the
allurement
of
lighter
books
she
wants
encouragement
as
much
as
the
other
requires
restraint
but
do
you
think
said
lady
belfield
that
they
are
of
great
use
in
attracting
children
to
love
reading
doubtless
they
are
said
stanley
the
misfortune
is
that
the
stimulants
used
to
attract
at
first
must
be
not
only
continued
but
heightened
to
keep
up
the
attraction
these
books
are
novels
in
miniature
and
the
excess
of
them
will
lead
to
the
want
of
novels
at
full
length
the
early
use
of
savory
dishes
is
not
usually
followed
by
an
appetite
for
plain
food
to
the
taste
thus
pampered
history
becomes
dry
grammar
laborious
and
religion
dull
my
wife
who
was
left
to
travel
through
the
wide
expanse
of
universal
history
and
the
dreary
deserts
of
rapin
and
mezerai
is
i
will
venture
to
assert
more
competently
skilled
in
ancient
french
and
english
history
than
any
of
the
girls
who
have
been
fed
or
rather
starved
on
extracts
and
abridgments
i
mean
not
to
recommend
the
two
last
named
authors
for
very
young
people
they
are
dry
and
tedious
and
children
in
our
day
have
opportunities
of
acquiring
the
same
knowledge
with
less
labor
we
have
brighter
i
wish
i
could
say
safer
lights
still
fact
and
not
wit
is
the
leading
object
of
history
stanley
says
that
the
very
tediousness
of
her
historians
had
a
good
effect
they
were
a
ballast
to
her
levity
a
discipline
to
her
mind
of
which
she
has
felt
the
benefit
in
her
subsequent
life
but
to
return
to
the
mass
of
children
books
the
too
great
profusion
of
them
protracts
the
imbecility
of
childhood
they
arrest
the
understanding
instead
of
advancing
it
they
give
forwardness
without
strength
they
hinder
the
mind
from
making
vigorous
shoots
teach
it
to
stoop
when
it
should
soar
and
to
contract
when
it
should
expand
yet
i
allow
that
many
of
them
are
delightfully
amusing
and
to
a
certain
degree
instructive
but
they
must
not
be
used
as
the
basis
of
instruction
and
but
sparingly
used
at
all
as
refreshment
from
labor
they
inculcate
morality
and
good
actions
surely
said
lady
belfield
it
is
true
replied
stanley
but
they
often
inculcate
them
on
a
worldly
principle
and
rather
teach
the
pride
of
virtue
and
the
profit
of
virtue
than
point
out
the
motive
of
virtue
and
the
principle
of
sin
they
reprobate
bad
actions
as
evil
and
injurious
to
others
but
not
as
an
offense
against
the
almighty
whereas
the
bible
comes
with
a
plain
straightforward
simple
but
powerful
principle
shall
i
do
this
great
wickedness
against
god
thee
thee
only
have
i
sinned
and
done
this
evil
in
thy
sight
even
children
should
be
taught
that
when
a
man
has
committed
the
greatest
possible
crime
against
his
fellow
creature
still
the
offense
against
god
is
what
will
strike
a
true
penitent
with
the
most
deep
remorse
all
morality
which
is
not
drawn
from
this
scriptural
source
is
weak
defective
and
hollow
these
entertaining
authors
seldom
ground
their
stories
on
any
intimation
that
human
nature
is
corrupt
that
the
young
reader
is
helpless
and
wants
assistance
that
he
is
guilty
and
wants
pardon
surely
my
dear
stanley
said
lady
belfield
though
i
do
not
object
to
the
truth
and
reasonableness
of
any
thing
you
have
said
i
can
not
think
that
these
things
can
possibly
be
made
intelligible
to
children
the
framers
of
our
catechism
madam
thought
otherwise
replied
stanley
the
catechism
was
written
for
children
and
contains
all
the
seeds
and
principles
of
christianity
for
men
it
evidently
requires
much
explanation
much
development
still
it
furnishes
a
wide
and
important
field
for
colloquial
instruction
without
which
young
persons
can
by
no
means
understand
a
composition
so
admirable
but
so
condensed
the
catechism
speaks
expressly
of
death
unto
sin
of
new
birth
unto
righteousness
of
born
in
sin
of
being
the
of
wrath
of
becoming
the
of
grace
of
sin
by
repentance
of
the
promises
of
god
by
faith
now
while
children
are
studying
these
great
truths
in
the
catechism
they
are
probably
at
the
same
time
almost
constantly
reading
some
of
those
entertaining
stories
which
are
grounded
and
built
on
a
quite
opposite
principle
and
do
not
even
imply
the
existence
of
any
such
fundamental
truths
surely
interrupted
lady
belfield
you
would
not
have
these
serious
doctrines
brought
forward
in
story
books
by
no
means
madam
replied
stanley
but
i
will
venture
to
assert
that
even
story
books
should
not
be
founded
on
a
principle
directly
to
them
nay
totally
of
them
the
arabian
nights
and
other
oriental
books
of
fable
though
loose
and
faulty
in
many
respects
yet
have
always
a
reference
to
the
religion
of
the
country
nothing
is
introduced
against
the
law
of
mohammed
nothing
subversive
of
the
opinions
of
a
mussulman
i
do
not
quarrel
with
books
for
having
religion
but
for
having
a
religion
a
book
which
in
nothing
opposes
the
principle
of
the
bible
i
would
be
far
from
calling
a
bad
book
though
the
bible
was
never
named
in
it
lady
belfield
observed
that
she
was
sorry
to
say
her
children
found
religious
studies
very
dry
and
tiresome
though
she
took
great
pains
and
made
them
learn
by
heart
a
multitude
of
questions
and
answers
a
variety
of
catechisms
and
explanations
and
the
best
abridgments
of
the
bible
my
dear
lady
belfield
replied
stanley
you
have
fully
accounted
for
the
dryness
and
dullness
of
which
you
complain
give
them
the
i
never
yet
knew
a
child
who
did
not
delight
in
the
bible
histories
and
who
would
not
desire
to
hear
them
again
and
again
from
the
histories
stanley
and
i
proceed
with
them
to
the
parables
and
from
them
to
the
miracles
and
a
few
of
the
most
striking
prophecies
when
they
have
acquired
a
good
deal
of
this
desultory
knowledge
we
begin
to
weave
the
parts
into
a
whole
the
little
girl
who
had
the
honor
of
dining
with
you
has
begun
this
morning
to
read
the
scriptures
with
her
mother
systematically
we
shall
soon
open
to
her
something
of
the
of
christianity
and
explain
how
those
miracles
and
prophecies
confirm
the
truth
of
that
religion
in
which
she
is
to
be
more
fully
instructed
upon
their
historical
knowledge
which
they
acquire
by
picking
out
the
most
interesting
stories
we
endeavor
to
ground
principles
to
enlighten
their
minds
and
precepts
to
influence
their
conduct
with
the
genuine
language
of
scripture
i
have
taken
particular
care
they
shall
be
well
acquainted
by
digging
for
the
ore
in
its
native
bed
while
they
have
been
studying
the
stories
their
minds
have
at
the
same
time
been
imbued
with
the
impressive
phraseology
of
scripture
i
make
a
great
point
of
this
having
often
seen
this
useful
impression
effectually
prevented
by
a
multitude
of
subsidiary
histories
and
explanations
which
too
much
supersede
the
use
of
the
original
text
only
observe
continued
he
what
divine
sentiments
what
holy
precepts
what
devout
ejaculations
what
strokes
of
what
flights
of
gratitude
what
transports
of
praise
what
touches
of
penitential
sorrow
are
found
comprised
in
some
one
short
sentence
woven
into
almost
every
part
of
the
historical
scriptures
observe
this
and
then
confess
what
a
pity
it
is
that
children
should
be
commonly
set
to
read
the
history
in
a
meagre
abridgment
stripped
of
those
gems
with
which
the
original
is
so
richly
inlaid
these
histories
and
expositions
become
very
useful
afterward
to
young
people
who
are
thoroughly
conversant
with
the
bible
itself
sir
john
observed
that
he
had
been
struck
with
the
remarkable
of
stanley
daughters
and
their
indifference
to
things
about
which
most
children
were
so
eager
selfishness
said
stanley
is
the
hydra
we
are
perpetually
combating
but
the
monster
has
so
much
vitality
that
new
heads
spring
up
as
fast
as
the
old
ones
are
cut
off
counteract
selfishness
that
inborn
inbred
mischief
i
hold
to
be
the
great
art
of
education
therefore
can
not
be
adequately
carried
on
except
by
those
who
are
deeply
convinced
of
the
doctrine
of
human
corruption
this
evil
principle
as
it
shows
itself
early
must
be
early
lopped
or
the
rapid
shoots
it
makes
will
as
your
favorite
eve
observes
soon
mock
our
scant
manuring
this
counteraction
continued
stanley
is
not
like
an
art
or
a
science
which
is
to
be
taken
up
at
set
times
and
laid
aside
till
the
allotted
period
of
instruction
returns
but
as
the
evil
shows
itself
at
all
times
and
in
all
shapes
the
of
instruction
is
to
be
bent
against
it
stanley
and
i
endeavor
that
not
one
reward
we
bestow
not
one
gratification
we
afford
shall
be
calculated
to
promote
it
gratifications
children
ought
to
have
the
appetites
and
inclinations
should
be
reasonably
indulged
we
only
are
cautious
not
to
employ
them
as
instrument
of
which
would
look
as
if
we
valued
them
highly
and
thought
them
a
fit
remuneration
for
merit
i
would
rather
show
a
little
indulgence
to
sensuality
sensuality
than
make
it
the
reward
of
goodness
which
seems
to
be
the
common
way
while
i
indulged
the
appetite
of
a
child
i
would
never
hold
out
that
indulgence
which
i
granted
to
the
lowest
the
animal
part
of
his
nature
as
a
payment
for
the
exertion
of
his
mental
or
moral
faculties
you
have
one
great
advantage
said
sir
john
and
i
thank
god
it
is
the
same
in
that
you
and
stanley
draw
evenly
together
nothing
impedes
domestic
regulation
so
effectually
as
where
parents
from
difference
of
sentiment
or
bad
judgment
obstruct
each
other
plans
or
where
one
parent
makes
the
other
insignificant
in
the
eyes
of
their
children
reynolds
replied
stanley
a
friend
of
mine
in
this
neighborhood
is
in
this
very
predicament
to
the
mother
weakness
the
father
temperate
discipline
seems
cruelty
she
is
perpetually
blaming
him
before
the
children
for
setting
them
to
their
books
her
attentions
are
divided
between
their
health
which
is
perfect
and
their
pleasure
which
is
obstructed
by
her
foolish
zeal
to
promote
it
far
more
than
by
his
prudent
restrictions
whatever
the
father
helps
them
to
at
table
the
mother
takes
from
them
lest
it
should
make
them
sick
what
he
forbids
is
always
the
very
thing
which
is
good
for
them
she
is
much
more
afraid
however
of
overloading
their
memories
than
their
stomachs
reading
she
says
will
spoil
the
girls
eyes
stooping
to
write
will
ruin
their
chests
and
working
will
make
them
if
the
boys
run
they
will
have
fevers
if
they
jump
they
will
sprain
their
ankles
if
they
play
at
cricket
a
blow
may
kill
them
if
they
swim
they
may
be
drowned
the
shallowness
of
the
stream
is
no
argument
of
safety
poor
reynolds
life
is
one
continued
struggle
between
his
sense
of
duty
to
his
children
and
his
complaisance
to
his
wife
if
he
carries
his
point
it
is
at
the
expense
of
his
peace
if
he
relaxes
as
he
commonly
does
his
children
are
the
victims
he
is
at
length
brought
to
submit
his
excellent
judgment
to
her
feeble
mind
lest
his
opposition
should
hurt
her
health
and
he
has
the
mortification
of
seeing
his
children
trained
as
if
they
had
nothing
but
bodies
to
the
wretched
education
of
reynolds
herself
all
this
mischief
may
be
attributed
for
she
is
not
a
bad
though
an
ignorant
woman
and
having
been
harshly
treated
by
her
own
parents
she
fell
into
the
vulgar
error
of
vulgar
minds
that
of
supposing
the
opposite
of
wrong
must
necessarily
be
right
as
she
found
that
being
perpetually
contradicted
had
made
herself
miserable
she
concluded
that
never
being
contradicted
at
all
would
make
her
children
happy
the
event
has
answered
as
might
have
been
foreseen
never
was
a
more
discontented
disagreeing
troublesome
family
the
gratification
of
one
want
instantly
creates
a
new
one
and
it
is
only
when
they
are
quite
worn
out
with
having
done
nothing
that
they
take
refuge
in
their
books
as
less
wearisome
than
idleness
sir
john
turning
to
lady
belfield
said
in
a
very
tender
tone
my
dear
caroline
this
story
in
its
principal
feature
does
not
apply
to
us
we
concur
completely
it
is
true
but
i
fear
we
concur
by
being
both
wrong
we
both
err
by
excessive
indulgence
as
to
the
case
in
point
while
children
are
young
they
may
perhaps
lean
to
the
parent
that
spoils
them
but
i
have
never
yet
seen
an
instance
of
young
persons
where
the
parents
differed
who
did
not
afterward
discover
a
much
stronger
affection
for
the
one
who
had
reasonably
restrained
them
than
for
the
other
whose
blind
indulgence
had
at
once
diminished
her
importance
and
their
own
reverence
i
observed
to
stanley
that
as
he
had
so
noble
a
library
and
wished
to
inspire
his
children
with
the
love
of
literature
i
was
surprised
to
see
their
apartment
so
slenderly
provided
with
books
this
is
the
age
of
excess
in
every
thing
replied
he
nothing
is
a
gratification
of
which
the
want
has
not
been
previously
felt
the
wishes
of
children
are
all
so
anticipated
that
they
never
experience
the
pleasure
excited
by
wanting
and
waiting
of
their
initiatory
books
they
have
a
pretty
copious
supply
but
as
to
books
of
entertainment
or
instruction
of
a
higher
kind
i
never
allow
them
to
possess
one
of
their
own
till
they
have
attentively
read
and
improved
by
it
this
gives
them
a
kind
of
title
to
it
and
that
desire
of
property
so
natural
to
human
creatures
i
think
stimulates
them
in
dispatching
books
which
are
in
themselves
a
little
dry
expectation
with
them
as
with
men
quickens
desire
while
possession
deadens
it
by
this
time
the
children
had
exhausted
all
the
refreshments
set
before
them
and
had
retreated
to
a
little
further
distance
where
without
disturbing
us
they
freely
enjoyed
their
innocent
gambols
playing
singing
laughing
dancing
reciting
verses
trying
which
could
puzzle
the
other
in
the
names
of
plants
of
which
they
pulled
single
leaves
to
increase
the
difficulty
all
succeeded
each
other
lady
belfield
looking
consciously
at
me
said
these
are
the
creatures
whom
i
foolishly
suspected
of
being
made
miserable
by
restraint
and
gloomy
through
want
of
indulgence
after
long
experience
said
stanley
i
will
venture
to
pronounce
that
not
all
the
anxious
cutting
out
of
pleasure
not
all
the
costly
indulgences
which
wealth
can
procure
not
all
the
contrivances
of
inventive
man
for
his
darling
youthful
offspring
can
find
out
an
amusement
so
pure
so
natural
so
cheap
so
rational
so
healthful
i
had
almost
said
so
religious
as
that
unbought
pleasure
connected
with
a
garden
kate
and
celia
who
had
for
some
time
been
peeping
into
the
bower
in
order
to
catch
an
interval
in
the
conversation
as
soon
as
they
found
our
attention
disengaged
stole
in
among
us
each
took
the
fond
father
by
a
hand
and
led
him
to
the
turf
seat
ph
oe
be
presented
him
a
book
which
he
opened
and
out
of
it
read
with
infinite
humor
grace
and
gayety
the
diverting
history
of
john
gilpin
this
it
seems
was
a
pleasure
to
which
they
had
been
led
to
look
forward
for
some
time
but
which
in
honor
of
kate
had
been
purposely
withheld
till
this
memorable
day
his
little
auditors
who
grouped
themselves
around
him
on
the
grass
were
nearly
convulsed
with
laughter
nor
were
the
tenants
of
the
bower
much
less
delighted
as
we
walked
into
the
house
stanley
said
whenever
i
read
to
my
children
a
light
and
gay
composition
which
i
often
do
i
generally
take
care
it
shall
be
the
work
of
some
valuable
author
to
whose
writings
this
shall
be
a
pleasant
and
tempting
prelude
what
child
of
spirit
who
hears
john
gilpin
will
not
long
to
be
thought
old
and
wise
enough
to
read
the
the
remembrance
of
the
infant
rapture
will
give
a
predilection
for
the
poet
desiring
to
keep
their
standard
high
i
accustom
them
to
none
but
good
writers
in
every
sense
of
the
word
by
this
means
they
will
be
less
likely
to
stoop
to
ordinary
ones
when
they
shall
hereafter
come
to
choose
for
themselves
lady
belfield
regretted
to
me
that
she
had
not
brought
some
of
her
children
to
the
grove
to
confess
a
disgraceful
truth
said
she
i
was
afraid
they
would
have
been
moped
to
death
and
to
confess
another
truth
still
more
disgraceful
to
my
own
authority
my
indulgence
has
been
so
injudicious
and
i
have
maintained
so
little
control
that
i
durst
not
bring
some
of
them
for
fear
of
putting
the
rest
out
of
humor
i
am
now
in
a
school
where
i
trust
i
may
learn
to
acquire
firmness
without
any
diminution
of
fondness
chapter
xxvi
the
next
morning
stanley
proposed
that
we
should
pay
a
visit
to
some
of
his
neighbors
he
and
sir
john
belfield
rode
on
horseback
and
i
had
the
honor
of
attending
the
ladies
in
the
sociable
lady
belfield
who
was
now
become
desirous
of
improving
her
own
too
relaxed
domestic
system
by
the
experience
of
stanley
told
her
how
much
she
admired
the
cheerful
obedience
of
her
children
she
said
she
did
not
so
much
wonder
to
see
them
so
good
but
she
owned
she
was
surprised
to
see
them
so
happy
i
know
not
replied
stanley
whether
the
increased
insubordination
of
children
is
owing
to
the
new
school
of
philosophy
and
politics
but
it
seems
to
me
to
make
part
of
the
system
when
i
go
sometimes
to
stay
with
a
friend
in
town
to
do
business
she
is
always
making
apologies
that
she
can
not
go
out
with
me
daughters
want
the
coach
if
i
ask
leave
to
see
the
friends
who
call
on
me
in
such
a
room
daughters
have
company
there
or
they
want
the
room
for
their
music
or
it
is
preparing
for
the
children
ball
in
the
evening
if
a
messenger
is
required
daughters
want
the
footman
there
certainly
prevails
a
spirit
of
independence
a
revolutionary
spirit
a
separation
from
the
parent
state
it
is
the
children
world
you
remind
me
madam
said
i
of
an
old
courtier
who
being
asked
by
louis
which
age
he
preferred
his
own
or
the
present
replied
passed
my
youth
in
respecting
old
age
and
i
find
i
must
now
pass
my
old
age
in
respecting
children
in
some
other
houses
said
stanley
where
we
visit
besides
that
of
poor
reynolds
the
children
seem
to
have
all
the
accommodation
and
i
have
observed
that
the
convenience
and
comfort
of
the
father
is
but
a
subordinate
consideration
the
respectful
terms
of
address
are
nearly
banished
from
the
vocabulary
of
children
and
the
somewhat
too
orderly
manner
which
once
prevailed
is
superseded
by
an
incivility
a
roughness
a
want
of
attention
which
is
surely
not
better
than
the
harmless
formality
which
it
has
driven
out
just
as
she
had
said
this
we
stopped
at
reynolds
gate
neither
he
nor
his
lady
were
at
home
stanley
who
wished
to
show
us
a
fine
reach
of
the
river
from
the
window
desired
the
servant
to
show
us
into
it
there
we
beheld
a
curious
illustration
of
what
we
had
heard
in
the
ample
lay
a
confused
heap
of
the
glittering
spoils
of
the
most
expensive
toys
before
the
rich
silk
chairs
knelt
two
of
the
children
in
the
act
of
demolishing
their
fine
painted
playthings
others
apart
sat
on
retired
and
more
deliberately
employed
in
picking
to
pieces
their
little
gaudy
works
of
art
a
pretty
girl
who
had
a
beautiful
wax
doll
on
her
lap
almost
as
big
as
herself
was
pulling
out
its
eyes
that
she
might
see
how
they
were
put
in
another
weary
of
this
costly
baby
was
making
a
little
doll
of
rags
a
boy
was
tearing
out
the
parchment
from
a
handsome
new
drum
that
he
might
see
as
he
told
us
where
the
noise
came
from
these
i
forgave
they
had
meaning
in
their
mischief
another
having
kicked
about
a
whole
little
gilt
library
was
sitting
with
the
decorated
pages
torn
asunder
at
his
feet
reading
a
little
dirty
penny
book
which
the
had
bought
of
a
hawker
at
the
door
the
persian
carpet
was
strewed
with
the
broken
limbs
of
a
painted
horse
almost
as
large
as
a
poney
while
the
discontented
little
master
was
riding
astride
on
a
long
rough
stick
a
bigger
boy
after
having
broken
the
panels
of
a
fine
gilt
coach
we
saw
afterwards
in
the
nailing
together
a
few
dirty
bits
of
ragged
elm
boards
to
make
himself
a
not
only
the
disciple
of
the
fastidious
jean
jacques
exclaimed
i
but
the
sound
votary
of
truth
and
reason
must
triumph
at
such
an
instance
of
the
satiety
of
riches
and
the
weariness
of
ignorance
and
idleness
one
such
practical
instance
of
the
insufficiency
of
affluence
to
the
pleasures
which
industry
must
one
such
actual
exemplification
of
the
folly
of
supposing
that
injudicious
profusion
and
mistaken
fondness
can
supply
that
pleasure
which
must
be
worked
out
before
it
can
be
enjoyed
is
worth
a
whole
folio
of
argument
or
exhortation
the
little
flock
paid
no
attention
to
us
and
only
returned
a
rude
o
or
s
to
our
questions
caroline
said
sir
john
these
painted
ruins
afford
a
good
lesson
for
us
we
must
desire
our
rich
uncles
and
our
generous
to
make
an
alteration
in
their
presents
if
they
can
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
withhold
them
it
is
a
sad
mistake
said
stanley
to
suppose
that
youth
wants
to
be
so
incessantly
amused
they
want
not
pleasures
to
be
chalked
out
for
them
lay
a
few
cheap
and
coarse
materials
in
their
way
and
let
their
own
busy
inventions
be
suffered
to
work
they
have
abundant
pleasure
in
the
mere
freshness
and
novelty
of
life
its
unbroken
health
its
elastic
spirit
its
versatile
temper
and
its
ever
new
resources
so
it
appears
stanley
said
sir
john
when
i
look
at
your
little
group
of
girls
recluses
as
they
are
called
how
many
cheap
yet
lively
pleasures
do
they
enjoy
their
successive
occupations
their
books
their
animating
exercise
their
charitable
rounds
their
ardent
friendships
the
social
table
at
which
the
elder
ones
are
companions
not
mutes
the
pleasures
of
their
garden
increasing
virtue
and
approving
heaven
while
we
were
sitting
with
lady
aston
on
whom
we
next
called
stanley
suddenly
exclaimed
the
misses
flam
are
coming
up
the
gravel
walk
lady
aston
looked
vexed
but
correcting
herself
said
stanley
we
owe
this
visit
to
you
or
rather
to
your
friend
bowing
to
me
they
saw
your
carriage
stop
here
or
they
would
not
have
done
so
dull
a
thing
as
to
have
called
on
me
these
new
guests
presented
a
new
scene
very
uncongenial
to
the
timid
and
tranquil
spirit
of
the
amiable
hostess
there
seemed
to
be
a
contest
between
the
sisters
who
should
be
most
eloquent
most
loud
or
most
inquisitive
they
eagerly
attacked
me
all
at
once
as
supposing
me
to
be
overflowing
with
intelligence
from
the
metropolis
a
place
which
they
not
only
believed
to
contain
exclusively
all
that
was
worth
seeing
but
all
that
was
worth
hearing
the
rest
of
the
world
they
considered
as
a
barren
wilderness
of
which
the
hungry
inhabitants
could
only
be
kept
from
starving
by
such
meagre
aliment
as
the
occasional
reports
of
its
pleasures
fashions
and
anecdotes
which
might
now
and
then
be
conveyed
by
some
stray
traveler
might
furnish
it
is
so
strange
to
us
said
miss
bell
and
so
monstrously
dull
and
vulgar
to
be
in
the
country
at
this
time
of
the
year
that
we
know
what
to
do
with
ourselves
as
to
the
time
of
year
madam
said
i
if
ever
one
would
wish
to
be
in
the
country
at
all
surely
this
month
is
the
point
of
perfection
the
only
immoral
thing
with
which
i
could
ever
charge
our
excellent
sovereign
is
that
he
was
born
in
june
and
has
thus
furnished
his
fashionable
subjects
with
a
loyal
pretense
for
encountering
sin
and
of
london
to
borrow
will
honeycomb
phrase
in
the
finest
month
of
the
twelve
but
where
that
is
the
real
motive
with
one
it
is
the
pretense
of
a
thousand
how
can
you
be
so
shocking
said
she
but
papa
is
really
grown
so
cross
and
stingy
as
to
prevent
our
going
to
town
at
all
these
last
two
or
three
years
and
for
so
mean
a
reason
that
i
am
ashamed
to
tell
you
out
of
politeness
i
did
not
press
to
know
i
needed
not
for
she
was
resolved
i
should
not
in
ignorance
she
went
on
do
you
know
he
pretends
that
times
are
hard
and
public
difficulties
increasing
and
he
declares
that
whatever
privations
we
endure
government
must
be
supported
so
he
says
it
is
right
to
draw
in
in
the
only
way
in
which
he
can
do
it
honestly
i
am
sure
it
is
not
doing
it
creditably
did
you
ever
hear
any
thing
so
shabby
shabby
madam
replied
i
i
honor
a
gentleman
who
has
integrity
enough
to
do
a
right
thing
and
good
sense
enough
not
to
be
ashamed
to
own
it
yes
but
papa
need
not
the
steward
declares
if
he
would
only
raise
his
tenants
a
very
little
he
would
have
more
than
enough
but
papa
is
inflexible
he
says
my
brother
must
do
as
he
pleases
when
he
comes
to
the
estate
but
that
he
himself
promised
when
he
came
into
possession
that
he
would
never
raise
the
rents
and
that
he
will
never
be
worse
than
his
word
as
i
could
not
find
in
my
heart
to
join
in
abusing
a
gentleman
for
resolving
never
to
be
worse
than
his
word
i
was
silent
she
then
inquired
with
more
seriousness
if
there
were
any
prospect
of
peace
i
was
better
pleased
with
this
question
as
it
implied
more
anxiety
for
the
lives
of
her
than
i
had
given
her
credit
for
i
am
anxiously
looking
into
all
the
papers
continued
she
without
giving
me
time
to
speak
because
as
soon
as
there
is
peace
papa
has
promised
that
we
shall
go
to
town
again
if
it
was
not
for
that
i
should
not
care
if
there
was
war
till
doomsday
for
what
with
marching
regiments
and
militia
and
volunteers
nothing
can
be
pleasanter
than
it
makes
the
country
i
mean
as
far
as
the
country
be
pleasant
they
then
ran
over
the
names
and
respective
merits
of
every
opera
singer
every
dancer
and
every
actor
with
incredible
volubility
and
i
believe
they
were
not
a
little
shocked
at
my
slender
acquaintance
with
the
nomenclature
and
the
little
interest
i
took
in
the
criticisms
they
built
upon
it
poor
lady
aston
looked
oppressed
and
fatigued
but
inwardly
rejoiced
as
she
afterward
owned
to
me
that
her
daughters
were
not
within
hearing
i
was
of
a
different
opinion
upon
the
spartan
principle
of
making
their
children
sober
by
the
spectacle
of
the
intoxicated
helots
miss
eloquence
seemed
to
make
but
little
impression
on
sir
george
or
rather
it
produced
an
effect
directly
contrary
to
admiration
his
good
taste
seemed
to
revolt
at
her
flippancy
every
time
i
see
this
young
man
he
rises
in
my
esteem
his
ingenuous
temper
and
engaging
modesty
set
off
to
advantage
a
very
fair
understanding
in
our
way
home
we
were
accosted
by
flam
after
a
rough
but
hearty
salutation
and
a
cordial
invitation
to
come
and
dine
with
him
he
galloped
off
being
engaged
on
business
this
is
an
honest
country
of
the
old
cut
said
stanley
afterward
he
has
a
very
good
estate
which
he
has
so
much
delight
in
managing
that
he
has
no
pleasure
in
any
thing
else
he
was
prevailed
on
by
his
father
to
marry
his
present
wife
for
no
other
reason
than
because
her
estate
joined
to
his
and
broke
in
a
little
on
the
but
it
was
judged
that
both
being
united
all
might
be
brought
within
a
ring
fence
this
was
thought
a
reason
sufficiently
powerful
for
the
union
of
two
immortal
beings
whose
happiness
here
and
hereafter
might
be
impeded
or
promoted
by
it
the
felicity
of
the
connection
has
been
in
exact
proportion
to
the
purity
of
the
motive
i
could
not
forbear
interrupting
stanley
by
observing
that
nothing
had
surprised
or
hurt
me
more
in
the
little
observation
i
had
made
on
the
subject
of
marriage
than
the
frequent
indifference
of
parents
to
the
moral
and
especially
to
the
religious
character
of
the
man
who
proposed
himself
that
family
fortune
and
connections
should
have
their
full
share
in
the
business
i
readily
admit
added
i
but
that
it
should
ever
form
the
chief
often
the
only
ground
of
acceptance
has
i
confess
lowered
mankind
in
my
esteem
more
completely
than
almost
any
other
instance
of
ambition
avarice
or
worldliness
that
a
very
young
girl
who
has
not
been
carefully
educated
should
be
captivated
by
personal
advantages
and
even
infatuated
by
splendor
is
less
surprising
than
that
parents
who
having
themselves
experienced
the
insufficiency
of
riches
to
happiness
that
they
should
be
eagerly
impatient
to
part
from
a
beloved
daughter
reared
with
fondness
at
least
if
not
with
wisdom
to
a
man
of
whose
principles
they
have
any
doubt
and
of
whose
mind
they
have
a
mean
opinion
is
a
thing
i
can
not
understand
and
yet
what
proposal
almost
is
rejected
on
this
ground
lucilla
eyes
at
this
moment
shone
with
such
expressive
brightness
that
i
exultingly
said
to
myself
lord
staunton
i
defy
thee
the
mischief
of
this
lax
principle
is
of
wide
extent
replied
stanley
when
girls
are
continually
hearing
what
an
advantageous
what
a
desirable
marriage
such
a
young
friend
has
made
with
a
man
so
rich
so
splendid
so
great
though
they
have
been
accustomed
to
hear
this
very
man
condemned
for
his
profligacy
perhaps
at
least
they
know
him
to
be
destitute
of
piety
when
they
hear
that
these
things
are
not
considered
as
any
objection
to
the
union
what
opinion
must
these
girls
form
not
only
of
the
maxims
by
which
the
world
is
governed
but
of
the
truth
of
that
religion
which
those
persons
profess
but
to
return
to
flam
he
passed
through
the
usual
course
of
education
but
has
profited
so
little
by
it
that
though
he
has
a
certain
natural
shrewdness
in
his
understanding
i
believe
he
has
scarcely
read
a
book
these
twenty
years
except
burn
and
agricultural
reports
yet
when
he
wants
to
make
a
figure
he
now
and
then
lards
his
discourse
with
a
scrap
of
latin
which
he
used
to
steal
in
his
exercises
he
values
himself
on
his
integrity
and
is
not
destitute
of
benevolence
these
he
says
are
the
sum
and
substance
of
religion
and
though
i
combat
this
mistaken
notion
as
often
as
he
puts
it
in
my
power
yet
i
must
say
that
some
who
make
more
profession
would
do
well
to
be
as
careful
in
these
points
he
often
contrasts
himself
with
his
old
friend
ned
tyrrel
and
is
proud
of
showing
how
much
better
a
man
he
is
without
religion
than
ned
is
with
all
his
pretensions
to
it
it
is
by
thus
comparing
ourselves
with
worse
men
that
we
grow
vain
and
with
more
fortunate
men
that
we
become
discontented
all
the
concern
he
gives
himself
about
his
wife
and
daughters
is
that
they
shall
not
run
him
in
debt
and
indeed
he
is
so
liberal
that
he
does
not
drive
them
to
the
necessity
in
every
thing
else
they
follow
their
own
devices
they
teased
him
however
to
let
them
spend
two
or
three
winters
in
town
the
mother
hinting
it
would
he
was
prevailed
on
to
try
it
as
a
speculation
but
the
experiment
failed
he
now
insists
that
they
shall
go
no
more
till
the
times
mend
to
any
of
the
advertising
places
such
as
london
brighton
or
bath
he
says
that
attending
so
many
fairs
and
markets
is
very
expensive
especially
as
the
girls
do
go
off
he
will
now
see
what
can
be
done
by
private
contract
at
home
without
the
cost
of
journeys
with
fresh
keep
and
trimming
and
docking
into
the
bargain
they
must
now
take
their
chance
among
country
dealers
and
provided
they
will
give
him
a
whose
estate
is
free
from
incumbrances
who
pays
his
debts
lives
within
his
income
does
not
rack
his
tenants
never
drinks
claret
hates
the
french
and
loves
field
sports
he
will
ask
no
more
questions
i
could
not
but
observe
how
preferable
the
father
conduct
with
all
its
faults
was
to
that
of
the
rest
of
the
family
i
had
imagined
said
i
that
this
coarse
character
was
quite
out
of
print
though
it
is
religiously
bad
and
of
course
morally
defective
yet
it
is
so
politically
valuable
that
i
should
not
be
sorry
to
see
a
new
edition
of
these
obsolete
squires
somewhat
corrected
and
better
lettered
all
his
good
qualities
said
stanley
for
want
of
religion
have
a
flaw
in
them
his
good
nature
is
so
little
directed
by
judgment
that
while
it
serves
the
individual
it
injures
the
public
as
a
brother
magistrate
i
am
obliged
to
act
in
almost
constant
opposition
to
him
and
his
indiscretions
do
more
mischief
by
being
of
a
nature
to
increase
his
popularity
he
is
fully
persuaded
that
occasional
intoxication
is
the
best
reward
for
habitual
industry
and
insists
that
it
is
good
old
english
kindness
to
make
the
church
ringers
periodically
tipsy
at
the
holidays
though
their
families
starve
for
it
the
whole
week
he
and
i
have
a
regular
contest
at
the
annual
village
fairs
because
he
insists
that
my
refusing
to
let
them
begin
on
a
sunday
is
abridging
their
few
rights
and
robbing
them
of
a
day
which
they
might
add
to
their
pleasure
without
injury
to
their
profit
he
allows
all
the
strolling
players
mountebanks
and
jugglers
to
exhibit
because
he
says
it
is
a
charity
his
charity
however
is
so
that
he
does
not
see
that
while
these
vagabonds
are
supplying
the
wants
of
the
day
their
improvident
habits
suffer
them
to
look
no
further
that
his
own
workmen
are
spending
their
money
in
these
illegal
diversions
while
the
expense
is
the
least
mischief
which
their
daughters
incur
our
next
visit
was
to
carlton
whom
i
had
found
in
one
or
two
previous
interviews
to
be
a
man
of
excellent
sense
and
a
perfect
gentleman
sir
john
renewed
with
pleasure
his
acquaintance
with
the
husband
while
lady
belfield
was
charmed
to
be
introduced
to
the
wife
with
whose
character
she
was
so
enamored
and
whose
gentle
manners
were
calculated
to
confirm
the
affection
which
her
little
history
had
inspired
chapter
xxvii
though
stanley
had
checked
my
impetuosity
in
my
application
to
him
and
did
not
encourage
my
addresses
with
a
promptitude
suited
to
the
ardor
of
my
affection
yet
as
the
warmth
of
my
attachment
notwithstanding
i
made
it
a
duty
to
restrain
its
outward
expression
could
not
escape
either
his
penetration
or
that
of
his
admirable
wife
they
began
a
little
to
relax
in
the
strictness
with
which
they
had
avoided
speaking
of
their
daughter
they
never
indeed
introduced
the
subject
themselves
yet
it
some
how
or
other
never
failed
to
find
its
way
into
all
conversation
in
which
i
was
one
of
the
interlocutors
sitting
one
day
in
lucilla
bower
with
stanley
and
speaking
though
in
general
terms
on
the
subject
nearest
my
heart
with
a
tenderness
and
admiration
as
sincere
as
it
was
fervent
i
dwelt
particularly
on
some
instances
which
i
had
recently
heard
from
edwards
of
her
tender
attention
to
the
sick
poor
and
her
zeal
in
often
visiting
them
without
regard
to
weather
or
the
accommodation
of
a
carriage
i
assure
you
said
stanley
you
her
lucilla
is
no
prodigy
dropped
down
from
the
clouds
ten
thousand
other
young
women
with
natural
good
sense
and
good
temper
might
with
the
same
education
the
same
neglect
of
what
is
useless
and
the
same
attention
to
what
is
necessary
acquire
the
same
habits
and
the
same
principles
her
being
no
prodigy
however
perhaps
makes
her
example
as
far
as
it
goes
more
important
she
may
be
more
useful
because
she
carries
not
that
discouraging
superiority
which
others
might
be
deterred
from
imitating
through
hopelessness
to
reach
if
she
is
not
a
miracle
whom
others
might
despair
to
emulate
she
is
a
christian
whom
every
girl
of
a
fair
understanding
and
good
temper
may
equal
and
whom
i
hope
and
believe
many
girls
excel
i
asked
stanley
permission
to
attend
the
young
ladies
in
one
of
their
benevolent
rounds
when
i
have
leisure
to
be
one
of
the
party
replied
she
smiling
you
shall
accompany
us
i
am
afraid
to
trust
your
warm
feelings
your
would
perhaps
lead
you
to
commend
as
a
merit
what
in
fact
deserves
no
praise
at
all
the
duly
being
so
obvious
and
so
indispensable
i
have
often
heard
it
regretted
that
ladies
have
no
stated
employment
no
profession
it
is
a
mistake
is
the
calling
of
a
lady
the
care
of
the
poor
is
her
men
have
little
time
or
taste
for
details
women
of
fortune
have
abundant
leisure
which
can
in
no
way
be
so
properly
or
so
pleasantly
filled
up
as
in
making
themselves
intimately
acquainted
with
the
worth
and
the
wants
of
all
within
their
reach
with
their
wants
because
it
is
their
bounden
duty
to
administer
to
them
with
their
worth
because
without
this
knowledge
they
can
not
administer
prudently
and
appropriately
i
expressed
to
stanley
the
delight
with
which
i
had
heard
of
the
admirable
regulations
of
her
family
in
the
management
of
the
poor
and
how
much
their
power
of
doing
good
was
said
to
be
enlarged
by
the
judgment
and
discrimination
with
which
it
was
done
we
are
far
from
thinking
replied
she
that
our
charity
should
be
limited
to
our
own
immediate
neighborhood
we
are
of
opinion
that
it
should
not
be
left
undone
anywhere
but
that
it
should
be
done
indispensably
we
consider
our
own
parish
as
our
more
appropriate
field
of
action
where
providence
by
the
bounds
of
our
habitation
seems
to
have
made
us
peculiarly
responsible
for
the
comfort
of
those
whom
he
has
doubtless
placed
around
us
for
that
purpose
it
is
thus
that
the
almighty
vindicates
his
justice
or
rather
calls
on
us
to
vindicate
it
it
is
thus
he
explains
why
he
admits
natural
evil
into
the
world
by
making
the
wants
of
one
part
of
the
community
an
exercise
for
the
compassion
of
the
other
as
in
different
circumstances
the
faults
of
one
part
of
mankind
are
an
exercise
for
the
forbearance
of
the
other
surely
added
stanley
the
reason
is
particularly
obvious
why
the
bounty
of
the
affluent
ought
to
be
most
liberally
though
not
exclusively
extended
to
the
spot
whence
they
derive
their
revenues
there
seems
indeed
to
be
a
double
motive
for
it
the
same
act
involves
a
duty
both
to
god
and
man
the
largest
bounty
to
the
necessitous
on
our
estates
is
rather
justice
than
charity
is
but
a
kind
of
acknowledgment
to
the
great
lord
and
proprietor
of
all
from
whom
we
hold
them
and
to
assist
their
own
laboring
poor
is
a
kind
of
natural
debt
which
persons
who
possess
great
landed
property
owe
to
those
from
the
sweat
of
whose
brow
they
derive
their
comforts
and
even
their
riches
is
a
commutation
in
which
as
the
advantage
is
greatly
on
our
side
so
is
our
duty
to
diminish
the
difference
a
paramount
obligation
i
then
repeated
my
request
that
i
might
be
allowed
to
take
a
practical
lesson
in
the
next
periodical
visit
to
the
cottages
stanley
replied
as
to
my
girls
the
elder
ones
i
trust
are
such
veterans
in
their
trade
that
your
approbation
can
do
them
no
harm
nor
do
they
stand
in
need
of
it
as
an
incentive
but
should
the
little
ones
find
that
their
charity
procures
them
praise
they
might
perhaps
be
charitable
for
the
sake
of
praise
their
benevolence
might
be
set
at
work
by
their
vanity
and
they
might
be
led
to
do
that
from
the
love
of
applause
which
can
only
please
god
when
the
principle
is
pure
iniquity
of
our
holy
my
good
friend
requires
much
christian
vigilance
next
to
not
giving
at
all
the
greatest
fault
is
to
give
from
ostentation
the
motive
robs
the
act
of
the
very
name
of
virtue
while
the
good
work
that
is
paid
in
praise
is
stripped
of
the
hope
of
higher
retribution
on
my
assuring
stanley
that
i
thought
such
an
introduction
to
their
systematic
schemes
of
charity
might
inform
my
own
mind
and
improve
my
habits
she
consented
and
i
have
since
been
a
frequent
witness
of
their
admirable
method
and
have
been
studying
plans
which
involve
the
good
both
of
body
and
soul
oh
if
i
am
ever
blest
with
a
coadjutress
a
directress
let
me
rather
say
formed
under
such
auspices
with
what
delight
shall
i
transplant
the
principles
and
practices
of
stanley
grove
to
the
priory
nor
indeed
would
i
ever
marry
but
with
the
animating
hope
that
not
only
myself
but
all
around
me
would
be
the
better
and
the
happier
for
the
presiding
genius
i
shall
place
there
sir
john
belfield
had
joined
us
while
we
were
on
this
topic
i
had
observed
that
though
he
was
earnest
on
the
general
principle
of
benevolence
which
he
considered
as
a
most
imperious
duty
or
as
he
said
in
his
warm
way
as
so
lively
a
pleasure
that
he
was
almost
ready
to
suspect
if
it
a
duty
yet
i
was
sorry
to
find
that
his
generous
mind
had
not
viewed
this
large
subject
under
all
its
aspects
he
had
not
hitherto
regarded
it
as
a
matter
demanding
any
thing
but
money
while
time
inquiry
discrimination
system
he
confessed
he
had
not
much
taken
into
the
account
he
did
a
great
deal
of
good
but
had
not
allowed
himself
time
or
thought
for
the
best
way
of
doing
it
charity
as
opposed
to
and
covetousness
he
warmly
exercised
but
when
with
a
willing
liberality
he
had
cleared
himself
from
the
suspicion
of
those
detestable
vices
he
was
indolent
in
the
proper
distribution
of
money
and
somewhat
negligent
of
its
just
application
nor
had
he
ever
considered
as
every
man
should
do
because
every
man
means
are
limited
how
the
greatest
quantity
of
good
could
be
done
with
any
given
sum
but
the
worst
of
all
was
he
had
imbibed
certain
popular
prejudices
respecting
the
more
charities
prejudices
altogether
unworthy
of
his
enlightened
mind
he
too
much
limited
his
ideas
of
bounty
to
bodily
wants
this
distinction
was
not
with
him
as
it
is
with
many
invented
as
an
argument
for
saving
his
money
which
he
most
willingly
bestowed
for
feeding
and
clothing
the
necessitous
but
as
to
the
propriety
of
affording
them
religious
instruction
he
owned
he
had
not
made
up
his
mind
he
had
some
doubts
whether
it
were
a
duty
whether
it
were
a
benefit
he
had
still
stronger
doubts
adding
that
he
should
begin
to
consider
the
subject
more
attentively
than
he
had
yet
done
stanley
in
reply
said
i
am
but
a
poor
casuist
sir
john
and
i
must
refer
you
to
stanley
for
abler
arguments
than
i
can
use
i
will
venture
however
to
say
that
even
on
your
own
ground
it
appears
to
be
a
pressing
duty
if
sin
be
the
cause
of
so
large
a
portion
of
the
miseries
of
human
life
must
not
that
be
the
noblest
charity
which
cures
or
lessens
or
prevents
sin
and
are
not
they
the
truest
benefactors
even
to
the
bodies
of
men
who
by
their
religious
exertions
to
prevent
the
corruption
of
vice
prevent
also
in
some
measure
that
poverty
and
disease
which
are
the
natural
concomitants
of
vice
if
in
endeavoring
to
make
men
better
by
the
infusion
of
a
religious
principle
which
shall
check
idleness
drinking
and
extravagance
we
put
them
in
the
way
to
become
healthier
and
richer
and
happier
it
will
furnish
a
practical
argument
which
i
am
sure
will
satisfy
your
benevolent
heart
chapter
xxviii
tyrrel
and
his
nephew
called
on
us
this
evening
and
interrupted
a
pleasant
and
useful
conversation
on
which
we
were
just
entering
do
you
know
stanley
said
tyrrel
that
you
absolutely
corrupted
my
nephew
by
what
passed
at
your
house
the
other
day
in
favor
of
reading
he
has
ever
since
been
ransacking
the
shelves
for
idle
books
i
should
be
seriously
concerned
replied
stanley
if
any
thing
i
had
said
should
have
drawn
edward
off
from
more
valuable
studies
or
diverted
him
from
the
important
pursuit
of
religious
knowledge
why
to
do
him
justice
and
you
too
resumed
tyrrel
he
has
since
that
conversation
begun
assiduously
to
devote
his
mornings
to
serious
reading
and
it
is
only
an
hour
leisure
in
the
evening
which
he
used
to
trifle
away
that
he
gives
to
books
of
taste
but
i
had
rather
he
would
let
them
all
alone
the
best
of
them
will
only
fill
his
heart
with
cold
morality
and
stuff
his
head
with
romance
and
fiction
i
would
not
have
a
religious
man
ever
look
into
a
book
of
your
nonsense
and
if
he
be
really
religious
he
will
make
a
general
bonfire
of
the
poets
that
is
rather
too
sweeping
a
sentence
said
stanley
it
would
i
grant
you
have
been
a
benefit
to
mankind
if
the
entire
works
of
some
celebrated
poets
and
a
considerable
portion
of
the
works
of
many
not
quite
so
exceptionable
were
to
assist
the
conflagration
of
your
pile
and
if
fuel
failed
said
sir
john
belfield
we
might
not
only
rob
belinda
altar
of
her
twelve
tomes
of
french
romances
neatly
gilt
but
feed
the
flame
with
countless
octavos
from
the
modern
school
but
having
made
this
concession
allow
me
to
observe
that
because
there
has
been
a
voluptuous
petronius
a
scoffing
lucian
and
a
licentious
ovid
to
say
nothing
of
the
numberless
modern
poets
or
rather
individual
poems
that
are
immoral
and
corrupt
shall
we
therefore
exclude
all
works
of
imagination
from
the
library
of
a
young
man
surely
we
should
not
indiscriminately
banish
the
muses
as
infallible
corrupters
of
the
youthful
mind
i
would
rather
consider
a
blameless
poet
as
the
auxiliar
of
virtue
whatever
talent
enables
a
writer
to
possess
an
empire
over
the
heart
and
to
lead
the
passions
at
his
command
puts
it
in
his
power
to
be
of
no
small
service
to
mankind
it
is
no
new
remark
that
the
abuse
of
any
good
thing
is
no
argument
against
its
legitimate
use
intoxication
affords
no
just
reason
against
the
use
of
wine
nor
prodigality
against
the
possession
of
wealth
in
the
instance
in
dispute
i
should
rather
infer
that
a
talent
capable
of
diffusing
so
much
mischief
was
susceptible
of
no
small
benefit
that
it
has
been
so
often
abused
by
its
misapplication
is
one
of
the
highest
instances
of
the
ingratitude
of
man
for
one
of
the
highest
gifts
of
god
i
can
not
think
said
i
that
the
almighty
conferred
such
a
faculty
with
a
wish
to
have
it
extinguished
works
of
imagination
have
in
many
countries
been
a
chief
instrument
in
civilization
poetry
has
not
only
preceded
science
in
the
history
of
human
progress
but
it
has
in
many
countries
preceded
the
knowledge
of
the
mechanical
arts
and
i
have
somewhere
read
that
in
scotland
they
could
write
elegant
latin
verse
before
they
could
make
a
for
my
own
part
in
my
late
visit
to
london
i
thought
the
decline
of
poetry
no
favorable
symptom
i
rejoice
to
hear
it
declining
said
tyrrel
i
hope
that
what
is
decaying
may
in
time
be
extinguished
tyrrel
would
have
been
delighted
with
that
with
which
i
was
displeased
replied
i
i
met
with
philosophers
who
were
like
plato
in
nothing
but
his
abhorrence
of
the
muses
with
politicians
who
resembled
burleigh
only
in
his
enmity
to
spenser
and
with
warriors
who
however
they
might
emulate
alexander
in
his
conquests
would
never
have
imitated
him
in
sparing
the
house
of
pindarus
the
of
poetry
said
stanley
is
to
touch
the
passions
and
its
to
lead
them
on
the
side
of
virtue
to
raise
and
to
purify
the
amusements
of
mankind
to
multiply
and
to
exalt
pleasures
which
being
purely
intellectual
may
help
to
exclude
such
as
are
gross
in
beings
so
addicted
to
sensuality
is
surely
not
only
to
give
pleasure
but
to
render
service
it
is
allowable
to
seize
every
avenue
to
the
heart
of
a
being
so
prone
to
evil
to
rescue
him
by
every
fair
means
not
only
from
the
degradation
of
vice
but
from
the
dominion
of
idleness
i
do
not
now
speak
of
gentlemen
of
the
sacred
function
to
which
edward
tyrrel
aspires
but
of
those
who
having
no
profession
have
no
stated
employment
and
who
having
more
leisure
will
be
in
danger
of
exceeding
the
due
bounds
in
the
article
of
amusement
let
us
then
endeavor
to
snatch
our
youth
of
fashion
from
the
low
pleasures
of
the
dissolute
to
snatch
them
not
only
from
the
destruction
of
the
but
from
the
excesses
of
the
by
inviting
them
to
an
elegant
delight
that
is
safe
and
especially
by
enlarging
the
range
of
pure
mental
pleasure
in
order
to
this
let
us
do
all
we
can
to
cultivate
their
taste
and
innocently
indulge
their
fancy
let
us
contend
with
impure
writers
those
deadliest
enemies
to
the
youthful
mind
by
opposing
to
them
in
the
chaster
author
images
more
attractive
wit
more
acute
learning
more
various
in
all
which
excellences
our
poets
certainly
excel
their
vicious
competitors
would
you
tyrrel
said
sir
john
throw
into
the
enemy
camp
all
the
light
arms
which
often
successfully
annoy
where
the
heavy
artillery
can
not
reach
let
us
replied
stanley
rescue
from
the
hands
of
the
profane
and
the
impure
the
monopoly
of
wit
which
they
affect
to
possess
and
which
they
would
possess
if
no
good
men
had
written
works
of
elegant
literature
and
if
all
good
men
totally
despised
them
for
my
own
part
said
tyrrel
i
believe
that
a
good
man
in
my
sense
of
the
word
will
neither
write
works
of
imagination
nor
read
them
at
your
age
and
mine
and
better
employed
as
we
certainly
may
be
said
stanley
we
want
not
such
resources
i
myself
though
i
retain
the
relish
have
little
leisure
for
the
indulgence
which
yet
i
would
allow
though
with
great
discrimination
to
the
young
and
the
unoccupied
what
is
to
whet
the
genius
of
the
champions
of
virtue
so
as
to
enable
them
successfully
to
combat
the
leaders
of
vice
and
infidelity
if
we
refuse
to
let
them
be
occasionally
sharpened
and
polished
by
such
studies
that
model
of
brilliant
composition
bishop
jeremy
taylor
was
of
this
opinion
when
he
said
whatever
instrument
piety
is
advantaged
use
that
though
thou
grindest
thy
spears
and
arrows
at
the
forges
of
the
philistines
i
know
continued
stanley
that
a
christian
need
not
borrow
weapons
of
attack
or
defense
from
the
classic
armory
but
to
drop
all
metaphor
if
he
is
called
upon
to
defend
truth
and
virtue
against
men
whose
minds
are
adorned
with
all
that
is
elegant
strengthened
with
all
that
is
powerful
and
enriched
with
all
that
is
persuasive
from
the
writers
in
question
is
he
likely
to
engage
with
due
advantage
if
his
own
mind
be
destitute
of
the
embellishments
with
which
theirs
abound
while
wit
and
imagination
are
favorite
instruments
shall
we
consider
the
aid
of
either
as
useless
much
less
as
sinful
in
their
opponents
while
young
men
be
amused
said
sir
john
it
is
surely
of
importance
that
they
should
be
amused
we
should
not
therefore
wish
to
obliterate
in
authors
such
faculties
as
wit
and
fancy
nor
to
extinguish
a
taste
for
them
in
readers
show
me
any
one
instance
of
good
that
ever
was
effected
by
any
one
poet
said
tyrrel
and
i
will
give
up
the
point
while
on
the
other
hand
a
thousand
instances
of
mischief
might
be
produced
the
latter
part
of
your
assertion
sir
said
i
i
fear
is
too
true
but
to
what
evil
has
elevation
of
fancy
led
milton
or
milton
his
readers
into
what
immoralities
did
it
involve
spenser
or
cowley
has
thomson
added
to
the
crimes
or
the
calamities
of
mankind
into
what
immoralities
did
it
plunge
gray
or
goldsmith
has
it
tainted
the
purity
of
beattie
in
his
minstrel
or
that
of
the
living
minstrel
of
the
lay
what
reader
has
mason
corrupted
or
what
reader
has
cowper
not
benefitted
milton
was
an
enthusiast
both
in
religion
and
politics
many
enthusiasts
with
whom
he
was
connected
doubtless
condemned
the
exercise
of
his
imagination
in
his
immortal
poem
as
a
crime
but
his
genius
was
too
mighty
to
be
restrained
by
opposition
and
his
imagination
too
vast
and
powerful
to
be
kept
down
by
a
party
had
he
confined
himself
to
his
prose
writings
weighty
and
elaborate
as
some
of
them
are
how
little
service
would
he
have
done
the
world
and
how
little
would
he
now
be
read
or
quoted
in
his
politics
might
blind
his
enemies
and
fanaticism
his
friends
but
now
who
comparatively
reads
the
iconoclastes
who
does
not
read
comus
what
then
said
tyrrel
you
would
have
our
young
men
spend
their
time
in
reading
idle
verses
and
our
girls
i
suppose
in
reading
loose
romances
it
is
to
preserve
both
from
evils
which
i
deprecate
said
stanley
that
i
would
consign
the
most
engaging
subjects
to
the
best
hands
and
raise
the
taste
of
our
youth
by
allowing
a
little
of
their
leisure
and
of
their
leisure
only
to
such
amusements
and
that
chiefly
with
a
view
to
disengage
them
from
worse
pursuits
it
is
not
romance
but
indolence
it
is
not
poetry
but
sensuality
which
are
the
prevailing
evils
of
the
day
evils
far
more
fatal
in
themselves
far
more
durable
in
their
effects
than
the
perusal
of
works
of
wit
and
genius
imagination
will
cool
of
itself
the
effervescence
of
fancy
will
soon
subside
but
absorbing
dissipation
but
paralyzing
idleness
but
degrading
grows
with
their
growth
and
strengthens
with
their
strength
a
judicious
reformer
said
sir
john
will
accommodate
his
remedy
to
an
existing
and
not
an
imaginary
evil
when
the
old
romances
the
grand
cyruses
the
clelias
the
calprenedes
and
the
cassandras
had
turned
all
the
young
heads
in
europe
or
when
the
fury
of
demanded
the
powerful
rein
of
cervantes
to
check
it
it
was
a
duty
to
attempt
to
lower
the
public
delirium
when
in
our
own
age
and
country
sterne
wrote
his
corrupt
but
too
popular
lesser
work
he
became
the
mischievous
founder
of
the
school
of
sentiment
a
hundred
writers
communicated
a
hundred
thousand
readers
caught
the
infection
sentimentality
was
the
disease
which
then
required
to
be
expelled
the
reign
of
sterne
is
past
sensibility
is
discarded
and
with
it
the
softness
which
it
must
be
confessed
belonged
to
it
romance
is
vanished
and
with
it
the
heroic
though
somewhat
unnatural
elevation
which
accompanied
it
we
have
little
to
regret
in
the
loss
of
either
nor
have
we
much
cause
to
rejoice
in
what
we
have
gained
by
the
exchange
a
pervading
and
substantial
selfishness
the
striking
characteristic
of
our
day
is
no
great
improvement
on
the
wildness
of
the
old
romance
or
the
vapid
puling
of
the
sentimental
school
surely
said
i
des
gourmands
at
that
instant
darting
across
my
mind
it
is
as
honorable
for
a
gentleman
to
excel
in
critical
as
in
culinary
skill
it
is
as
noble
to
cultivate
the
intellectual
taste
as
that
of
the
palate
it
is
at
least
as
creditable
to
discuss
the
comparative
merits
of
sophocles
and
shakspeare
as
the
rival
ingredients
of
a
soup
or
a
sauce
i
will
even
venture
to
affirm
that
it
is
as
dignified
an
amusement
to
run
a
tilt
in
favor
of
virgil
or
tasso
against
their
assailants
as
to
run
a
barouche
against
a
score
of
rival
barouches
and
though
i
own
that
in
gulliver
land
of
the
houyhnhnms
the
keeping
up
the
breed
of
horses
might
have
been
the
nobler
patriotism
yet
in
great
britain
it
is
hitherto
at
least
no
contemptible
exertion
of
skill
and
industry
keep
up
the
breed
of
gentlemen
chapter
xxix
i
strolled
out
alone
intending
to
call
at
the
rectory
but
was
prevented
by
meeting
the
worthy
barlow
who
was
coming
to
the
grove
i
could
not
lose
so
fair
an
opportunity
of
introducing
a
subject
that
was
seldom
absent
from
my
thoughts
i
found
it
was
a
subject
on
which
i
had
no
new
discoveries
to
impart
he
told
me
he
had
seen
and
rejoiced
in
the
election
my
heart
had
made
i
was
surprised
at
his
penetration
he
smiled
and
told
me
he
took
no
great
credit
for
his
sagacity
in
perceiving
what
was
obvious
to
spectators
far
more
indifferent
than
himself
that
i
resembled
those
animals
who
by
hiding
their
heads
in
the
earth
fancied
nobody
could
see
them
i
asked
him
a
thousand
questions
about
lucilla
whose
fine
mind
i
knew
he
had
in
some
measure
contributed
to
form
i
inquired
with
an
eagerness
which
he
called
jealousy
who
were
her
admirers
as
many
men
as
have
seen
her
replied
he
i
know
no
man
who
has
so
many
rivals
as
yourself
to
relieve
your
apprehensions
however
i
will
tell
you
that
though
there
have
been
several
competitors
for
her
favor
not
one
has
been
accepted
there
has
indeed
this
summer
been
a
very
formidable
candidate
young
lord
staunton
who
has
a
large
estate
in
the
county
and
whom
she
met
on
a
visit
at
these
words
i
felt
my
fears
revive
a
young
and
handsome
peer
seemed
so
redoubtable
a
rival
that
for
a
moment
i
only
remembered
she
was
a
woman
and
forgot
that
she
was
lucilla
you
may
set
your
heart
at
rest
said
barlow
who
saw
my
emotion
she
heard
he
had
seduced
the
innocent
daughter
of
one
of
his
tenants
under
the
most
specious
pretense
of
honorable
love
this
together
with
the
looseness
of
his
religious
principles
led
her
to
give
his
lordship
a
positive
refusal
though
he
is
neither
destitute
of
talents
nor
personal
accomplishments
how
ashamed
was
i
of
my
jealousy
how
i
felt
my
admiration
increase
yet
i
thought
it
was
too
great
before
to
admit
of
augmentation
another
proposal
said
barlow
was
made
to
her
father
by
a
man
every
way
unexceptionable
but
she
desired
him
to
be
informed
that
it
was
her
earnest
request
that
he
would
proceed
no
further
but
spare
her
the
pain
of
refusing
a
gentleman
for
whose
character
she
entertained
a
sincere
respect
but
being
persuaded
she
could
never
be
able
to
feel
more
than
respect
she
positively
declined
receiving
his
addresses
assuring
him
at
the
same
time
that
she
sincerely
desired
to
retain
as
a
friend
him
whom
she
felt
herself
obliged
to
refuse
as
a
husband
she
is
as
far
from
the
vanity
of
seeking
to
make
conquest
as
from
the
ungenerous
insolence
of
using
ill
those
whom
her
merit
has
captivated
and
her
judgment
can
not
accept
after
admiring
in
the
warmest
terms
the
purity
and
generosity
of
her
heart
i
pressed
barlow
still
further
as
to
the
interior
of
her
mind
i
questioned
him
as
to
her
early
habits
and
particularly
as
to
her
religious
attainments
telling
him
that
nothing
was
indifferent
to
me
which
related
to
lucilla
miss
stanley
replied
he
is
governed
by
a
simple
practical
end
in
all
her
religious
pursuits
she
reads
her
bible
not
from
habit
that
she
may
acquit
herself
of
a
customary
form
not
to
exercise
her
ingenuity
by
allegorizing
literal
passages
or
spiritualizing
plain
ones
but
that
she
may
improve
in
knowledge
and
grow
in
grace
she
accustoms
herself
to
meditation
in
order
to
get
her
mind
more
deeply
imbued
with
a
sense
of
eternal
things
she
practices
that
she
may
learn
to
watch
against
the
first
risings
of
bad
dispositions
and
to
detect
every
latent
evil
in
her
heart
she
lives
in
the
regular
habit
of
prayer
not
only
that
she
may
implore
pardon
of
sin
but
that
she
may
obtain
strength
against
it
she
told
me
one
day
when
she
was
ill
that
if
she
did
not
constantly
examine
the
actual
state
of
her
mind
she
should
pray
at
random
without
any
certainty
what
particular
sins
she
should
pray
against
or
what
were
her
particular
wants
she
has
read
much
scripture
and
little
controversy
there
are
some
doctrines
that
she
does
not
pretend
to
define
which
she
yet
practically
adopts
she
can
not
perhaps
give
you
a
disquisition
on
the
mysteries
of
the
holy
spirit
but
she
can
and
does
fervently
implore
his
guidance
and
instruction
she
believes
in
his
efficacy
and
depends
on
his
support
she
is
sensible
that
those
truths
which
from
their
deep
importance
are
most
obvious
have
more
of
the
vitality
of
religion
and
influence
practice
more
than
those
abstruse
points
which
unhappily
split
the
religious
world
into
so
many
parties
if
i
were
to
name
what
are
her
predominant
virtues
i
should
say
sincerity
and
humility
conscious
of
her
own
imperfections
she
never
justifies
her
faults
and
seldom
extenuates
them
she
receives
reproof
with
meekness
and
advice
with
gratitude
her
own
conscience
is
always
so
ready
to
condemn
her
that
she
never
wonders
nor
takes
offense
at
the
censures
of
others
that
softness
of
manner
which
you
admire
in
her
is
not
the
varnish
of
good
breeding
nor
is
it
merely
the
effect
of
good
temper
though
in
both
she
excels
but
it
is
the
result
of
humility
she
appears
humble
not
because
a
mild
exterior
is
graceful
but
because
she
has
an
inward
conviction
of
unworthiness
which
prevents
an
assuming
manner
yet
her
humility
has
no
cant
she
never
disburdens
her
conscience
by
a
few
disparaging
phrases
nor
lays
a
trap
for
praise
by
indiscriminately
condemning
herself
her
humility
never
impairs
her
cheerfulness
for
the
sense
of
her
wants
directs
her
to
seek
and
her
faith
enables
her
to
find
the
sure
foundation
of
a
better
hope
than
any
which
can
be
derived
from
a
delusive
confidence
in
her
own
goodness
one
day
continued
barlow
when
i
blamed
her
gently
for
her
backwardness
in
expressing
her
opinion
on
some
serious
point
she
said
always
feel
diffident
in
speaking
on
these
subjects
not
only
lest
i
should
be
to
assume
but
lest
i
really
assume
a
degree
of
piety
which
may
not
belong
to
me
my
great
advantages
make
me
jealous
of
myself
my
dear
father
has
so
carefully
instructed
me
and
i
live
so
much
in
the
habit
of
hearing
his
pious
sentiments
that
i
am
often
afraid
of
appearing
better
than
i
am
and
of
pretending
to
feel
in
my
heart
what
perhaps
i
only
approve
in
my
judgment
when
my
beloved
mother
was
ill
continued
she
often
caught
myself
saying
mechanically
god
will
be
done
when
i
blush
to
own
how
little
i
felt
in
my
heart
of
that
resignation
of
which
my
lips
were
so
lavish
i
hung
with
inexpressible
delight
on
every
word
barlow
uttered
and
expressed
my
fears
that
such
a
prize
was
too
much
above
my
deserts
to
allow
me
to
encourage
very
sanguine
hopes
you
have
my
cordial
wishes
for
your
success
said
he
though
i
shall
lament
the
day
when
you
snatch
so
fair
a
flower
from
our
fields
to
transplant
it
into
your
northern
gardens
we
had
now
reached
the
where
sir
john
and
lady
belfield
joined
us
as
it
was
very
hot
barlow
proposed
to
conduct
us
a
nearer
way
he
carried
us
through
a
small
nursery
of
which
i
had
not
before
observed
though
it
was
adjoining
the
from
which
it
was
separated
and
concealed
by
a
row
of
tall
trees
i
expressed
my
surprise
that
the
delicate
lucilla
would
allow
so
coarse
an
inclosure
to
be
so
near
her
ornamented
ground
you
see
she
does
all
she
can
to
shut
it
out
replied
he
i
will
tell
you
how
it
happens
for
i
can
not
vindicate
the
taste
of
my
fair
friend
without
exposing
a
better
quality
in
her
but
if
i
betray
her
you
must
not
betray
me
it
is
a
rule
when
any
servant
who
has
lived
seven
years
at
the
grove
marries
provided
they
have
conducted
themselves
well
and
make
a
prudent
choice
for
stanley
to
give
them
a
piece
of
ground
on
the
waste
to
build
a
cottage
he
also
allows
them
to
take
stones
from
his
quarry
and
lime
from
his
kiln
to
this
he
adds
a
bit
of
ground
for
a
garden
stanley
presents
some
kitchen
furniture
and
gives
a
wedding
dinner
and
the
rector
refuses
his
fee
for
performing
the
ceremony
caroline
said
sir
john
this
is
not
the
first
time
since
we
have
been
at
the
grove
that
i
have
been
struck
with
observing
how
many
benefits
naturally
result
to
the
poor
from
the
rich
living
on
their
own
estates
their
dependants
have
a
thousand
petty
local
advantages
which
cost
almost
nothing
to
the
giver
which
are
yet
valuable
to
the
receiver
and
of
which
the
absent
never
think
you
have
heard
said
barlow
that
miss
stanley
from
her
childhood
has
been
passionately
fond
of
cultivating
a
garden
when
she
was
hardly
fourteen
she
began
to
reflect
that
the
delight
she
took
in
this
employment
was
attended
neither
with
pleasure
nor
profit
to
any
one
but
herself
and
she
became
jealous
of
a
gratification
which
was
so
entirely
selfish
she
begged
this
piece
of
waste
ground
of
her
father
and
stocked
it
with
a
number
of
fine
young
of
the
common
sort
apples
pears
plums
and
the
smaller
fruits
when
there
is
a
wedding
among
the
older
servants
or
when
any
good
girl
out
of
her
school
marries
she
presents
their
little
empty
garden
with
a
dozen
young
and
a
few
trees
of
the
other
sorts
never
forgetting
to
embellish
their
little
court
with
roses
and
these
last
she
transplants
from
the
shrubbery
not
to
fill
up
the
as
it
is
called
with
any
thing
that
is
of
no
positive
use
she
employs
a
poor
lame
man
in
the
village
a
day
in
a
week
to
look
after
this
nursery
and
by
cutting
and
grafts
a
good
stock
is
raised
on
a
small
space
it
is
done
at
her
own
expense
stanley
making
this
a
condition
when
he
gave
her
the
ground
said
he
as
it
is
it
would
be
my
charity
and
not
hers
and
she
would
get
thanked
for
a
kindness
which
would
cost
her
nothing
the
little
ph
oe
be
cooperates
in
this
and
all
her
sister
labors
of
love
some
such
union
of
charity
with
every
personal
indulgence
she
generally
imposes
on
herself
and
from
this
association
she
has
acquired
another
virtue
for
she
tells
me
smiling
she
is
sometimes
obliged
to
content
herself
with
practicing
frugality
instead
of
charity
when
she
finds
she
can
not
afford
both
her
own
gratification
and
the
charitable
act
which
she
wanted
to
associate
with
it
and
is
therefore
compelled
to
give
up
the
charity
she
compels
herself
to
give
up
the
indulgence
also
by
this
she
gets
a
little
money
in
hand
for
the
next
demand
and
thus
is
enabled
to
afford
both
next
time
as
he
finished
speaking
we
spied
the
lame
gardener
pruning
and
clearing
the
trees
well
james
said
the
doctor
how
does
your
nursery
thrive
why
sir
said
the
poor
man
we
are
rather
thin
of
stout
trees
at
present
you
know
we
had
three
weddings
at
christmas
which
took
of
my
best
at
a
blow
besides
half
a
dozen
tall
and
as
many
plums
but
we
shall
soon
fetch
it
up
for
miss
lucilla
makes
me
plant
two
for
every
one
that
is
removed
so
that
we
are
always
provided
for
a
wedding
come
when
it
will
i
now
recollected
that
i
had
been
pleased
with
observing
so
many
young
orchards
and
flourishing
cottage
gardens
in
the
village
little
did
i
suspect
the
fair
hand
which
could
thus
in
a
few
years
diffuse
an
air
of
smiling
comfort
around
these
humble
habitations
and
embellish
poverty
itself
she
makes
they
told
me
her
periodical
visits
of
inspection
to
see
that
neatness
and
order
do
not
degenerate
not
to
appear
too
eager
i
asked
the
poor
man
some
questions
about
his
health
which
seemed
infirm
i
am
but
weak
sir
said
he
for
matter
of
that
but
i
should
have
been
dead
long
ago
but
for
the
family
he
gives
me
the
run
of
his
kitchen
and
miss
lucilla
allows
me
a
week
for
one
day
work
and
any
odd
hour
i
can
spare
but
she
do
let
me
earn
it
for
she
is
always
watching
for
fear
it
should
be
too
hot
or
too
cold
or
too
wet
for
me
and
she
brings
me
my
dose
of
bark
herself
into
this
that
she
may
be
sure
i
take
it
for
she
says
servants
and
poor
people
like
to
have
medicines
provided
for
them
but
do
care
to
take
them
then
she
watches
that
i
do
throw
my
coat
on
the
wet
grass
which
she
says
gives
laboring
men
so
much
rheumatism
and
she
made
me
this
nice
flannel
waistcoat
sir
with
her
own
hands
at
christmas
they
give
me
a
new
suit
from
top
to
toe
so
that
i
want
for
nothing
but
a
more
thankful
heart
for
i
never
can
be
grateful
enough
to
god
and
my
benefactors
i
asked
some
further
questions
only
to
have
the
pleasure
of
hearing
him
talk
longer
about
lucilla
but
sir
said
he
interrupting
me
i
hear
bad
news
very
bad
news
pray
your
honor
forgive
me
what
do
you
mean
james
said
i
seeing
his
eyes
fill
why
sir
all
the
servants
at
the
grove
will
have
it
that
you
are
come
to
carry
off
miss
lucilla
god
bless
her
whenever
she
goes
your
edwards
sir
says
you
are
one
of
the
best
of
gentlemen
but
indeed
indeed
i
do
know
who
can
deserve
her
she
will
carry
a
blessing
wherever
she
goes
the
honest
fellow
put
up
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
to
brush
away
his
tears
nor
was
i
ashamed
of
those
with
which
his
honest
affection
filled
my
own
eyes
while
we
were
talking
a
poor
little
girl
who
i
knew
by
her
neat
uniform
belonged
to
miss
stanley
school
passed
us
with
a
little
basket
in
her
hand
james
called
to
her
make
haste
rachel
you
are
after
your
time
what
this
is
james
is
it
said
doctor
barlow
and
rachel
is
come
for
her
nosegays
yes
sir
said
james
i
forgot
to
tell
their
honors
that
every
saturday
as
soon
as
her
school
is
over
the
younger
misses
give
rachel
leave
to
come
and
fetch
some
flowers
out
of
their
garden
which
she
carries
to
the
town
to
sell
she
commonly
gets
a
shilling
half
of
which
they
make
her
lay
out
to
bring
home
a
little
tea
for
her
poor
sick
mother
and
the
other
half
she
lays
up
to
buy
shoes
and
stockings
for
herself
and
her
crippled
sister
every
little
is
a
help
where
there
is
nothing
sir
sir
john
said
nothing
but
looked
at
lady
belfield
whose
eyes
glistened
while
she
softly
said
o
how
little
do
the
rich
ever
think
what
the
aggregate
even
of
their
own
squandered
shillings
would
do
in
the
way
of
charity
were
they
systematically
applied
to
it
james
now
unlocked
a
little
private
door
which
opened
into
the
there
at
a
distance
sitting
in
a
circle
on
the
grass
under
a
tree
we
beheld
all
the
little
stanleys
with
a
basket
of
flowers
between
them
out
of
which
they
were
earnestly
employed
in
sorting
and
tying
up
nosegays
we
stood
some
time
admiring
their
little
busy
faces
and
active
fingers
without
their
perceiving
us
and
got
up
to
them
just
as
they
were
putting
their
bouquets
into
rachel
basket
with
which
she
marched
off
with
many
charges
from
the
children
to
waste
no
time
by
the
way
and
to
be
sure
to
leave
the
nosegay
that
had
the
myrtle
in
it
at
williams
how
many
nosegays
have
you
given
to
rachel
louisa
said
barlow
to
the
eldest
of
the
four
only
three
apiece
sir
replied
she
we
think
it
a
bad
day
when
we
ca
make
up
our
dozen
they
are
all
our
own
we
seldom
touch
mamma
flowers
and
we
never
suffer
james
to
take
ours
because
ph
oe
be
says
it
might
be
tempting
him
little
jane
lamented
that
lucilla
had
given
them
nothing
except
two
or
three
sprigs
of
her
best
flowering
myrtle
which
added
she
we
make
rachel
give
into
the
bargain
to
a
poor
sick
lady
who
loves
flowers
and
used
to
have
good
ones
of
her
own
but
who
has
now
no
money
to
spare
and
could
not
afford
to
give
more
than
the
common
price
for
a
nosegay
for
her
sick
room
so
we
always
slip
a
nice
flower
or
two
out
of
the
into
her
little
bunch
and
say
nothing
when
we
walk
that
way
we
often
leave
her
some
flowers
ourselves
and
would
do
it
oftener
if
it
did
not
hurt
poor
rachel
trade
as
we
walked
away
from
the
sweet
prattlers
barlow
said
these
little
creatures
already
emulate
their
sisters
in
associating
some
petty
kindness
with
their
own
pleasures
the
act
is
trifling
but
the
habit
is
good
as
is
every
habit
which
helps
to
take
us
out
of
self
which
teaches
us
to
transfer
our
attention
from
our
own
gratification
to
the
wants
or
the
pleasures
of
another
i
confess
said
lady
belfield
as
we
entered
the
house
that
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
it
was
any
part
of
charity
to
train
my
children
to
the
habit
of
sacrificing
their
time
or
their
pleasure
for
the
benefit
of
others
though
to
do
them
justice
they
are
very
feeling
and
very
liberal
with
their
money
my
dear
caroline
said
sir
john
it
is
our
money
not
theirs
it
is
i
fear
a
cheap
liberality
and
abridges
not
themselves
of
one
enjoyment
they
well
know
we
are
so
pleased
to
see
them
charitable
that
we
shall
instantly
repay
them
with
interest
whatever
they
give
away
so
that
we
have
hitherto
afforded
them
no
opportunity
to
show
their
actual
dispositions
nay
i
begin
to
fear
that
they
may
become
charitable
through
covetousness
if
they
find
out
that
the
more
they
give
the
more
they
shall
get
we
must
correct
this
artificial
liberality
as
soon
as
we
get
home
chapter
xxx
a
few
days
after
sir
john
belfield
and
i
agreed
to
take
a
ride
to
carlton
where
we
breakfasted
nothing
could
be
more
rational
than
the
whole
turn
of
his
mind
nor
more
agreeable
and
unreserved
than
his
conversation
his
behavior
to
his
amiable
wife
was
affectionately
attentive
and
sir
john
who
is
a
most
critical
observer
remarked
that
it
was
quite
natural
and
unaffected
it
appeared
to
be
the
result
of
esteem
inspired
by
her
merit
and
quickened
by
a
sense
of
his
own
former
unworthiness
which
made
him
feel
as
if
he
could
never
do
enough
to
efface
the
memory
of
past
unkindness
he
manifested
evident
symptoms
of
a
mind
earnestly
intent
on
the
discovery
and
pursuit
of
moral
and
religious
truth
and
from
the
natural
ardor
of
his
character
and
the
sincerity
of
his
remorse
his
attainments
seemed
likely
to
be
rapid
and
considerable
the
sweet
benignity
of
carlton
countenance
was
lighted
up
at
our
entrance
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
we
had
been
informed
with
what
pleasure
she
observed
every
accession
of
acquaintance
which
her
husband
made
though
her
natural
modesty
prevented
her
from
introducing
any
subject
herself
yet
when
any
thing
useful
was
brought
forward
by
others
she
promoted
it
by
a
look
compounded
of
pleasure
and
intelligence
after
a
variety
of
topics
had
been
dispatched
the
conversation
fell
on
the
prejudices
which
were
commonly
entertained
by
men
of
the
world
against
religion
for
my
own
part
said
carlton
i
must
confess
that
no
man
had
ever
more
or
stronger
prejudices
to
combat
than
myself
i
mean
not
my
own
exculpation
when
i
add
that
the
imprudence
the
want
of
judgment
and
above
all
the
incongruous
mixtures
and
inconsistencies
in
many
characters
who
are
reckoned
religious
are
ill
calculated
to
do
away
the
unfavorable
opinions
of
men
of
an
opposite
way
of
thinking
as
i
presume
that
you
gentlemen
are
not
ignorant
of
the
errors
of
my
early
life
error
indeed
is
an
appellation
far
too
mild
i
shall
not
scruple
to
own
to
you
the
source
of
those
prejudices
which
retarded
my
progress
even
after
i
became
ashamed
of
my
deviations
from
virtue
i
had
felt
the
turpitude
of
my
bad
habits
long
before
i
had
courage
to
renounce
them
and
i
renounced
them
long
before
i
had
courage
to
avow
my
abhorrence
of
them
sir
john
and
i
expressed
ourselves
extremely
obliged
by
the
candor
of
his
declaration
and
assured
him
that
his
further
communications
would
not
only
gratify
but
benefit
us
educated
as
i
had
been
said
carlton
in
an
almost
entire
ignorance
of
religion
mine
was
rather
a
habitual
indifference
than
a
systematic
unbelief
my
thoughtless
course
of
life
though
it
led
me
to
hope
that
christianity
might
not
be
true
yet
had
by
no
means
been
able
to
convince
me
that
it
was
false
as
i
had
not
been
taught
to
search
for
truth
at
the
fountain
for
i
was
unacquainted
with
the
bible
i
had
no
readier
means
for
forming
my
judgment
than
by
observing
though
with
a
careless
and
casual
eye
what
effect
religion
produced
in
those
who
professed
to
be
influenced
by
it
my
observations
augmented
my
prejudices
what
i
saw
of
the
professors
increased
my
dislike
of
the
profession
all
the
charges
brought
by
their
enemies
for
i
had
been
accustomed
to
weigh
the
validity
of
testimony
had
not
riveted
my
dislike
so
much
as
the
difference
between
their
own
avowed
principles
and
their
obvious
practice
religious
men
should
be
the
more
cautious
of
giving
occasion
for
reproach
as
they
know
the
world
is
always
on
the
watch
and
is
more
glad
to
have
its
prejudices
confirmed
than
removed
i
seize
the
moment
of
carlton
absence
who
was
just
then
called
out
of
the
room
but
returned
almost
immediately
to
observe
that
what
rooted
my
disgust
was
the
eagerness
with
which
the
mother
of
my
inestimable
wife
who
made
a
great
parade
of
religion
pressed
the
marriage
of
her
only
child
with
a
man
whose
conduct
she
knew
to
be
irregular
and
of
whose
principles
she
entertained
a
just
that
is
an
unfavorable
opinion
to
see
i
repeat
the
religious
mother
of
carlton
obviously
governed
in
her
zeal
for
promoting
our
union
by
motives
as
worldly
as
those
of
my
poor
father
who
pretended
to
no
religion
at
all
would
have
extremely
lowered
any
respect
which
i
might
have
previously
been
induced
to
entertain
for
characters
of
that
description
nor
was
this
disgust
diminished
by
my
acquaintance
with
tyrrel
i
had
known
him
while
a
professed
man
of
the
world
and
had
at
that
time
i
fear
disliked
his
violent
temper
his
narrow
mind
and
his
coarse
manners
more
than
his
vices
i
had
heard
of
the
power
of
religion
to
change
the
heart
and
i
ridiculed
the
wild
chimera
my
contempt
for
this
notion
was
confirmed
by
the
conduct
of
tyrrel
in
his
new
character
i
found
it
had
produced
little
change
in
him
except
furnishing
him
with
a
new
subject
of
discussion
i
saw
that
he
had
only
laid
down
one
set
of
opinions
and
taken
up
another
with
no
addition
whatever
to
his
virtues
and
with
the
addition
to
his
vices
of
spiritual
pride
and
for
with
hypocrisy
i
have
no
right
to
charge
any
man
i
observed
that
tyrrel
and
one
or
two
of
his
new
friends
rather
courted
attack
than
avoided
it
they
considered
discretion
as
the
infirmity
of
a
worldly
mind
and
every
attempt
at
kindness
or
conciliation
as
an
abandonment
of
faith
they
eagerly
ascribed
to
their
piety
the
dislike
which
was
often
excited
by
their
peculiarities
i
found
them
apt
to
dignify
the
disapprobation
which
their
singularity
occasioned
with
the
name
of
persecution
i
have
seen
them
take
comfort
in
the
belief
that
it
was
their
religion
which
was
disliked
when
perhaps
it
was
chiefly
their
oddities
at
tyrrel
i
became
acquainted
with
your
friends
and
ranby
i
leave
you
to
judge
whether
their
characters
that
of
the
lady
especially
was
calculated
to
do
away
my
prejudices
i
had
learned
from
my
favorite
roman
poet
a
precept
in
composition
of
never
making
a
god
appear
except
on
occasions
worthy
of
a
god
i
have
since
had
reason
to
think
this
rule
as
justly
theological
as
it
is
classical
so
thought
not
the
ranbys
it
will
indeed
readily
be
allowed
by
every
reflecting
mind
as
god
is
to
be
viewed
in
all
his
works
so
his
providence
ordereth
all
things
both
in
heaven
and
on
earth
but
surely
there
is
something
very
offensive
in
the
indecent
familiarity
with
which
the
name
of
god
and
providence
is
brought
in
on
every
trivial
occasion
as
was
the
constant
practice
of
and
ranby
i
was
not
even
then
so
illogical
a
reasoner
as
to
allow
a
general
and
deny
a
particular
providence
if
the
one
were
true
i
inferred
that
the
other
could
not
be
false
but
i
felt
that
the
religion
of
these
people
was
of
a
slight
texture
and
a
bad
taste
i
was
disgusted
with
littleness
in
some
instances
and
with
inconsistency
in
others
still
their
absurdity
gave
me
no
right
to
suspect
their
sincerity
whenever
ranby
had
a
petty
inclination
to
gratify
she
had
always
recourse
to
what
she
called
the
of
in
matters
of
no
more
moment
than
whether
she
should
drink
tea
with
one
neighbor
instead
of
another
she
was
or
or
i
observed
that
she
always
took
care
to
interpret
these
to
her
own
taste
and
under
their
sanction
she
always
did
what
her
fancy
led
her
to
do
she
professed
to
follow
this
guidance
on
such
minute
occasions
that
i
had
almost
said
her
piety
seemed
a
little
impious
to
the
actual
dispensations
of
providence
especially
when
they
came
in
a
trying
or
adverse
shape
i
did
not
observe
more
submission
than
i
had
seen
in
persons
who
could
not
be
suspected
of
religion
i
must
own
to
you
also
that
as
i
am
rather
fastidious
i
began
to
fancy
that
vulgar
language
quaint
phrases
and
false
grammar
were
necessarily
connected
with
religion
the
sacrifice
of
taste
and
elegance
seemed
indispensable
and
i
was
inclined
to
fear
that
if
were
right
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
to
heaven
with
good
english
though
i
grant
there
is
some
truth
in
your
remarks
sir
said
i
you
must
allow
that
when
men
are
determined
at
all
events
to
hunt
down
religious
characters
they
are
never
at
a
loss
to
find
plausible
objections
to
justify
their
dislike
and
while
they
conceal
even
from
themselves
the
real
motive
of
their
aversion
the
vigilance
with
which
they
pry
into
the
characters
of
men
who
are
reckoned
pious
is
exercised
with
the
secret
hope
of
finding
faults
enough
to
confirm
their
prejudices
as
a
general
truth
you
are
perfectly
right
said
carlton
but
at
the
period
to
which
i
allude
i
had
now
got
to
that
stage
of
my
progress
as
to
be
rather
searching
for
instances
to
invite
than
to
repel
me
in
my
inquiry
you
will
grant
however
said
i
that
it
is
a
common
effect
of
prejudice
to
transfer
the
fault
of
a
religious
man
to
religion
itself
such
a
man
happens
to
have
an
uncouth
manner
an
awkward
gesture
an
unmodulated
voice
his
allusions
may
be
coarse
his
phraseology
quaint
his
language
slovenly
the
solid
virtues
which
may
lie
disguised
under
these
incumbrances
go
for
nothing
the
man
is
absurd
and
therefore
christianity
is
ridiculous
its
truth
however
though
it
may
be
eclipsed
can
not
be
extinguished
like
its
divine
author
it
is
the
same
yesterday
and
forever
there
was
another
repulsive
circumstance
replied
carlton
the
scanty
charities
both
of
tyrrel
and
his
new
friends
so
inferior
to
the
liberality
of
my
father
and
of
flam
who
never
professed
to
be
governed
by
any
higher
motive
than
mere
feeling
strengthened
my
dislike
the
calculations
of
mere
reason
taught
me
that
the
religious
man
who
does
not
greatly
exceed
the
man
of
the
world
in
his
liberalities
falls
short
of
him
because
the
worldly
man
who
gives
liberally
acts
above
his
principle
while
the
christian
who
does
no
more
falls
short
of
his
and
though
i
by
no
means
insist
that
liberality
is
a
certain
indication
of
piety
yet
i
will
venture
to
assert
that
the
want
of
the
one
is
no
doubtful
symptom
of
the
absence
of
the
other
i
next
resolved
to
watch
carefully
the
conduct
of
another
description
of
christians
who
come
under
the
class
of
the
formal
and
the
decent
they
were
considered
as
more
creditable
but
i
did
not
perceive
them
to
be
more
exemplary
they
were
more
absorbed
in
the
world
and
more
governed
by
its
opinions
i
found
them
clamorous
in
defense
of
the
church
in
words
but
neither
adorning
it
by
their
lives
nor
embracing
its
doctrines
in
their
hearts
rigid
in
the
observance
of
some
of
its
external
rites
but
little
influenced
by
its
liberal
principles
and
charitable
spirit
they
venerated
the
establishment
merely
as
a
political
institution
but
of
her
outward
forms
they
conceived
as
comprehending
the
whole
of
her
excellence
of
her
spiritual
beauty
and
superiority
they
seemed
to
have
no
conception
i
observed
in
them
less
warmth
of
affection
for
those
with
whom
they
agreed
in
external
profession
than
of
rancor
for
those
who
differed
from
them
though
but
a
single
shade
and
in
points
of
no
importance
they
were
cordial
haters
and
frigid
lovers
had
they
lived
in
the
early
ages
when
the
church
was
split
into
parties
by
paltry
disputes
they
would
have
thought
the
controversy
about
the
time
of
keeping
easter
of
more
consequence
than
the
event
itself
which
that
festival
celebrates
my
dear
sir
said
i
as
soon
as
he
had
done
speaking
you
have
accounted
very
naturally
for
your
prejudices
your
chief
error
seems
to
have
consisted
in
the
selection
of
the
persons
you
adopted
as
standards
they
all
differed
as
much
from
the
right
as
they
differed
from
each
other
and
the
truth
is
their
vehement
desire
to
differ
from
each
other
was
a
chief
cause
why
they
departed
so
much
from
the
right
but
your
instances
were
so
unhappily
chosen
that
they
prove
nothing
against
christianity
the
two
opposite
descriptions
of
persons
who
deterred
you
from
religion
and
who
passed
muster
in
their
respective
corps
under
the
generic
term
of
religious
would
i
believe
be
scarcely
acknowledged
as
such
by
the
soberly
and
the
soundly
pious
my
own
subsequent
experience
resumed
carlton
has
confirmed
the
justness
of
your
remark
when
i
began
through
the
gradual
change
wrought
in
my
views
and
actions
by
the
silent
but
powerful
preaching
of
carlton
example
to
have
less
interest
in
believing
that
christianity
was
false
i
then
applied
myself
to
search
for
reasons
to
believe
that
it
was
true
but
plain
abstract
reasoning
though
it
might
catch
hold
on
beings
who
are
all
pure
intellect
and
though
it
might
have
given
a
right
bias
even
to
opinions
would
probably
never
have
determined
my
conduct
unless
i
saw
it
clothed
as
it
were
with
a
body
i
wanted
examples
which
should
influence
me
to
act
as
well
as
proofs
which
should
incline
me
to
believe
something
which
would
teach
me
what
to
do
as
well
as
what
to
think
i
wanted
exemplifications
as
well
as
precepts
i
doubted
of
all
merely
speculative
truth
i
wanted
from
beholding
the
effect
to
refer
back
to
the
principle
i
wanted
arguments
more
palpable
and
less
theoretic
surely
said
i
to
myself
if
religion
be
a
principle
it
must
be
an
operative
one
and
i
would
rationally
infer
that
christianity
were
true
if
the
tone
of
christian
practice
were
high
i
began
to
look
clandestinely
into
henrietta
bible
there
i
indeed
found
that
the
spirit
of
religion
was
invested
with
just
such
a
body
as
i
had
wished
to
see
that
it
exhibited
actions
as
well
as
sentiments
characters
as
well
as
doctrines
the
life
portrayed
evidently
governed
by
the
principle
inculcated
the
conduct
and
the
doctrine
in
just
correspondence
but
if
the
bible
be
true
thought
i
may
we
not
reasonably
expect
that
the
principles
which
once
produced
the
exalted
practice
which
that
bible
records
will
produce
similar
effects
now
i
put
rashly
perhaps
the
truth
of
christianity
on
this
issue
and
sought
society
of
a
higher
stamp
fortunately
the
increasing
external
decorum
of
my
conduct
began
to
make
my
reception
less
difficult
among
good
men
than
it
had
been
hitherto
and
that
for
the
sake
of
my
wife
my
visits
had
rather
been
endured
than
encouraged
nor
was
i
myself
forward
to
seek
the
society
which
shunned
me
even
with
those
superior
characters
with
whom
i
did
occasionally
associate
i
had
not
come
near
enough
to
form
an
exact
estimate
disinterestedness
and
consistency
had
become
with
me
a
sort
of
touchstone
by
which
to
try
the
characters
i
was
investigating
my
experiment
was
favorable
i
had
for
some
time
observed
my
conduct
with
a
mixture
of
admiration
as
to
the
act
and
incredulity
as
to
the
motive
i
had
seen
her
foregoing
her
own
indulgences
that
she
might
augment
those
of
a
husband
whom
she
had
so
little
reason
to
love
here
were
the
two
qualities
i
required
with
a
renunciation
of
self
without
parade
or
profession
still
this
was
a
solitary
instance
when
on
a
nearer
survey
i
beheld
barlow
exhibiting
by
his
exemplary
conduct
during
the
week
the
best
commentary
on
his
sunday
sermon
when
i
saw
him
refuse
a
living
of
nearly
twice
the
value
of
that
he
possessed
because
the
change
would
diminish
his
usefulness
i
was
when
i
saw
and
stanley
spending
their
time
and
fortune
as
entirely
in
acts
of
beneficence
as
if
they
had
built
their
eternal
hope
on
charity
alone
and
yet
utterly
renouncing
any
such
confidence
and
trusting
entirely
to
another
foundation
when
i
saw
lucilla
a
girl
of
eighteen
refuse
a
young
nobleman
of
a
clear
estate
and
neither
disagreeable
in
his
person
or
manner
on
the
single
avowed
ground
of
his
loose
principles
when
the
noble
rejection
of
the
daughter
was
supported
by
the
parents
whose
principles
no
arguments
drawn
from
rank
or
fortune
could
subvert
or
shake
i
was
these
and
some
other
instances
of
the
same
nature
were
exactly
the
test
i
had
been
seeking
here
was
upon
full
proof
here
was
between
practice
and
profession
by
such
examples
and
by
cordially
adopting
those
principles
which
produced
them
together
with
a
daily
increasing
sense
of
my
past
enormities
i
hope
to
become
in
time
less
unworthy
of
the
wife
to
whom
i
owe
my
peace
on
earth
and
my
hope
in
heaven
the
tears
which
had
been
collecting
in
carlton
eyes
for
some
time
now
silently
stole
down
her
cheeks
sir
john
and
myself
were
deeply
affected
with
the
frank
and
honest
narrative
to
which
we
had
been
listening
it
raised
in
us
an
esteem
and
affection
for
the
narrator
which
has
since
been
continually
augmenting
i
do
not
think
the
worse
of
his
state
for
the
difficulties
which
impeded
it
nor
that
his
advancement
will
be
less
sure
because
it
has
been
gradual
his
fear
of
delusion
has
been
a
salutary
guard
the
apparent
slowness
of
his
progress
has
arisen
from
his
dread
of
and
the
diligence
of
his
search
is
an
indication
of
his
sincerity
but
did
you
not
find
said
i
that
the
piety
of
these
more
correct
christians
drew
upon
them
nearly
as
much
censure
and
suspicion
as
the
indiscretion
of
the
enthusiasts
and
that
the
formal
class
who
were
nearly
as
far
removed
from
effective
piety
as
from
wild
fanaticism
ran
away
with
all
the
credit
of
religion
with
those
replied
carlton
who
are
on
the
watch
to
discredit
christianity
no
consistency
can
stand
their
determined
opposition
but
the
fair
and
candid
inquirer
will
not
reject
the
truth
when
it
forces
the
truth
on
the
mind
with
a
clear
and
convincing
evidence
though
i
had
been
joining
in
the
general
subject
yet
my
thoughts
had
wandered
from
it
to
lucilla
ever
since
her
noble
rejection
of
lord
staunton
had
been
named
by
carlton
as
one
of
the
causes
which
had
strengthened
his
unsteady
faith
and
while
he
and
sir
john
were
talking
over
their
youthful
connections
i
resumed
with
carlton
who
sat
next
me
the
interesting
topic
lord
staunton
said
she
is
a
relation
and
not
a
very
distant
one
of
ours
he
used
to
take
more
delight
in
carlton
society
when
it
was
less
improving
than
he
does
now
that
it
is
become
really
valuable
yet
he
often
visits
us
miss
stanley
now
and
then
indulges
me
with
her
company
for
a
day
or
two
in
these
visits
lord
staunton
happened
to
meet
her
two
or
three
times
he
was
enchanted
with
her
person
and
manners
and
exerted
every
art
and
faculty
of
pleasing
which
it
must
be
owned
he
possesses
though
we
should
both
have
rejoiced
in
an
alliance
with
the
excellent
family
at
the
grove
through
this
sweet
girl
i
thought
it
my
duty
not
to
conceal
from
her
the
irregularity
of
my
cousin
conduct
in
one
particular
instance
as
well
as
the
general
looseness
of
his
religious
principles
the
caution
was
the
more
necessary
as
he
had
so
much
prudence
and
good
breeding
as
to
behave
with
general
propriety
when
under
our
roof
and
he
allowed
me
to
speak
to
him
more
freely
than
any
other
person
when
i
talked
seriously
he
sometimes
laughed
always
opposed
but
was
never
angry
one
day
he
arrived
quite
unexpectedly
when
miss
stanley
was
with
me
he
found
us
in
my
reading
together
a
on
the
power
of
religion
to
change
the
dreading
some
levity
i
strove
to
hide
the
book
but
he
took
it
out
of
my
hand
and
glancing
his
eye
on
the
title
he
said
laughing
is
a
foolish
subject
enough
a
does
not
want
changing
and
with
a
one
none
of
have
any
thing
to
do
lucilla
spoke
not
a
syllable
all
the
light
things
he
uttered
and
which
he
meant
for
wit
so
far
from
raising
a
smile
increased
her
gravity
she
listened
but
with
some
uneasiness
to
a
desultory
conversation
between
us
in
which
i
attempted
to
assert
the
power
of
the
almighty
to
rectify
the
mind
and
alter
the
character
lord
staunton
treated
my
assertion
as
a
wild
chimera
and
said
was
sure
i
had
more
understanding
than
to
adopt
such
a
methodistical
notion
professing
at
the
same
time
a
vague
admiration
of
virtue
and
goodness
which
he
said
bowing
to
miss
stanley
were
where
they
existed
at
all
that
a
good
heart
did
not
want
mending
and
a
bad
one
could
not
be
mended
with
other
similar
expressions
all
implying
contempt
of
my
position
and
exclusive
compliment
to
her
after
dinner
lucilla
stole
away
from
a
conversation
which
was
not
very
interesting
to
her
and
carried
her
book
to
the
knowing
that
lord
staunton
liked
to
sit
long
at
table
but
his
lordship
missing
her
for
whom
the
visit
was
meant
soon
broke
up
the
party
and
hearing
which
way
she
took
pursued
her
to
the
after
a
profusion
of
compliments
expressive
of
his
high
admiration
he
declared
his
passion
in
very
strong
and
explicit
terms
and
requested
her
permission
to
make
proposals
to
her
father
to
which
he
conceived
she
could
have
no
possible
objection
she
thanked
him
with
great
politeness
for
his
favorable
opinion
but
frankly
told
him
that
though
extremely
sensible
of
the
honor
he
intended
her
thanks
were
all
she
had
to
offer
in
return
she
earnestly
desired
the
business
might
go
no
further
and
that
he
would
spare
himself
the
trouble
of
an
application
to
her
father
who
always
kindly
allowed
her
to
decide
for
herself
in
a
concern
of
so
much
importance
disappointed
shocked
and
irritated
at
a
rejection
so
wholly
unexpected
he
insisted
on
knowing
the
cause
was
it
his
person
was
it
his
fortune
was
it
his
understanding
to
which
she
objected
she
honestly
assured
him
it
was
neither
his
rank
and
fortune
were
above
her
expectations
to
his
natural
advantages
there
could
be
no
reasonable
objection
he
still
vehemently
insisted
on
her
assigning
the
true
cause
she
was
then
driven
to
the
necessity
of
confessing
that
she
feared
his
principles
were
not
those
of
a
man
with
whom
she
could
venture
to
trust
her
own
he
bore
this
reproof
with
more
patience
than
she
had
expected
as
she
had
made
no
exception
to
his
person
and
understanding
both
of
which
he
rated
very
highly
he
could
better
bear
with
the
charge
brought
against
his
principles
on
which
he
did
not
set
so
great
a
value
she
had
indeed
wounded
his
pride
but
not
in
the
part
where
it
was
most
vulnerable
that
be
all
said
he
gayly
objection
is
at
an
end
your
charming
society
will
reform
me
your
influence
will
raise
my
principles
and
your
example
will
change
my
character
my
lord
said
she
her
courage
increasing
with
her
indignation
from
from
you
who
declared
only
this
morning
that
the
work
of
changing
the
heart
was
too
great
for
the
almighty
himself
you
do
not
now
scruple
to
declare
that
it
is
in
power
that
work
which
is
too
hard
for
omnipotence
your
flattery
would
make
me
believe
a
weak
girl
can
accomplish
no
my
lord
i
will
never
add
to
the
number
of
those
rash
women
who
have
risked
their
eternal
happiness
on
this
vain
hope
it
would
be
too
late
to
repent
of
my
folly
after
my
presumption
had
incurred
its
just
punishment
so
saying
she
left
the
with
a
polite
dignity
which
as
he
afterward
told
me
increased
his
passion
while
it
inflamed
his
pride
almost
to
madness
finding
she
refused
to
appear
he
quitted
the
house
but
not
his
design
his
applications
have
since
been
repeated
but
though
he
has
met
with
the
firmest
repulses
both
from
the
parents
and
the
daughter
he
can
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
relinquish
his
hope
it
is
so
far
a
misfortune
to
us
as
lucilla
now
never
comes
near
us
except
he
is
known
not
to
be
in
the
country
had
the
objection
been
to
his
person
or
fortune
he
says
as
it
would
have
been
substantial
it
might
have
been
insuperable
but
where
the
only
ground
of
difference
is
mere
matter
of
opinion
he
is
sure
that
time
and
perseverance
will
conquer
such
a
chimerical
objection
i
returned
to
the
grove
not
only
cured
of
every
jealous
feeling
but
transported
with
such
a
decisive
proof
of
the
dignity
and
purity
of
miss
stanley
mind
chapter
xxxi
miss
sparkes
a
neighboring
lady
whom
the
reputation
of
being
a
wit
and
an
amazon
had
kept
single
at
the
age
of
though
her
person
was
not
disagreeable
and
her
fortune
considerable
called
in
one
morning
while
we
were
at
breakfast
she
is
remarkable
for
her
pretension
to
odd
and
opposite
qualities
she
is
something
of
a
scholar
and
a
huntress
a
politician
and
a
farrier
she
outrides
flam
and
outargues
tyrrel
excels
in
driving
four
in
hand
and
in
canvassing
at
an
election
she
is
always
anxious
about
the
party
but
never
about
the
candidate
in
whom
she
requires
no
other
merit
but
his
being
in
the
opposition
which
she
accepts
as
a
pledge
for
all
other
merit
in
her
adoption
of
any
talent
or
her
exercise
of
any
quality
it
is
always
sufficient
recommendation
to
her
that
it
is
not
feminine
from
the
window
we
saw
her
descend
from
her
lofty
phæton
and
when
she
came
the
cap
the
whip
the
masculine
attire
the
loud
voice
the
intrepid
look
the
independent
air
the
whole
deportment
indicated
a
disposition
rather
to
confer
protection
than
to
accept
it
she
made
an
apology
for
her
intrusion
by
saying
that
her
visit
was
rather
to
the
stable
than
the
one
of
her
horses
was
a
little
lame
and
she
wanted
to
consult
stanley
groom
who
it
seems
was
her
oracle
in
that
science
in
which
she
herself
is
a
professed
adept
during
her
short
visit
she
labored
so
sedulously
not
to
diminish
by
her
conversation
the
character
she
was
so
desirous
to
establish
that
her
efforts
defeated
the
end
they
aimed
to
secure
she
was
witty
with
all
her
might
and
her
sarcastic
turn
for
wit
it
was
not
made
little
amends
for
her
want
of
simplicity
i
perceived
that
she
was
fond
of
the
bold
the
marvelous
and
the
incredible
she
ventured
to
tell
a
story
or
two
so
little
within
the
verge
of
ordinary
probability
that
she
risked
her
credit
for
veracity
without
perhaps
really
violating
truth
the
credit
acquired
by
such
relations
seldom
pays
the
relator
for
the
hazard
run
by
the
communication
as
we
fell
into
conversation
i
observed
the
peculiarities
of
her
character
she
never
sees
any
difficulties
in
any
question
whatever
the
topic
is
started
while
the
rest
of
the
company
are
hesitating
as
to
the
propriety
of
their
determination
she
alone
is
never
at
a
loss
her
answer
always
follows
the
proposition
without
a
moment
interval
for
examination
herself
or
for
allowing
any
other
person
a
chance
of
delivering
an
opinion
stanley
who
always
sets
an
example
of
strict
punctuality
to
his
family
had
come
in
to
perform
his
daily
devotions
somewhat
later
than
usual
i
could
perceive
that
he
had
been
a
little
moved
his
countenance
wanted
something
of
its
placid
serenity
though
it
seemed
to
be
seriousness
untinctured
with
anger
he
confessed
while
we
were
at
breakfast
that
he
had
been
spending
above
an
hour
in
bringing
one
of
his
younger
children
to
a
sense
of
a
fault
she
had
committed
she
has
not
said
he
told
an
absolute
falsehood
but
in
what
she
said
there
was
prevarication
there
was
pride
there
was
passion
her
perverseness
has
at
length
given
way
tears
of
resentment
are
changed
into
tears
of
contrition
but
she
is
not
to
appear
in
the
she
is
to
be
deprived
of
the
honor
of
carrying
food
to
the
poor
in
the
evening
nor
is
she
to
furnish
her
contribution
of
nosegays
to
rachel
basket
this
is
a
mode
of
punishment
we
prefer
to
that
of
curtailing
any
personal
indulgences
the
importance
we
should
assign
to
the
privation
would
be
setting
too
much
value
on
the
enjoyment
you
should
be
careful
stanley
said
miss
sparkes
not
to
break
the
child
spirit
too
tight
a
rein
will
check
her
generous
ardor
and
curb
her
genius
i
would
not
subdue
the
independence
of
her
mind
and
make
a
tame
dull
animal
of
a
creature
whose
very
faults
give
indications
of
a
soaring
nature
even
lady
belfield
to
whose
soft
and
tender
heart
the
very
sound
of
punishment
or
even
privation
carried
a
sort
of
terror
asked
stanley
if
he
did
not
think
he
had
a
trifling
offense
too
seriously
and
punished
it
too
severely
the
thing
is
a
trifle
in
itself
replied
he
but
infant
prevarication
unnoticed
and
unchecked
is
the
prolific
seed
of
subterfuge
of
expediency
of
deceit
of
falsehood
of
hypocrisy
but
the
dear
little
creature
said
lady
belfield
is
not
addicted
to
equivocation
i
have
always
admired
her
correctness
in
her
pleasant
prattle
it
is
for
that
very
reason
replied
stanley
that
i
am
so
careful
to
check
the
first
indication
of
the
contrary
tendency
as
the
fault
is
a
solitary
one
i
trust
the
punishment
will
be
so
too
for
which
reason
i
have
marked
it
in
a
way
to
which
her
memory
will
easily
recur
brandon
an
amiable
friend
of
mine
but
of
an
indolent
temper
through
a
negligence
in
watching
over
an
early
propensity
to
deceit
suffered
his
only
son
to
run
on
from
one
stage
of
falsehood
to
another
till
he
settled
down
in
a
most
consummate
hypocrite
his
plausible
manners
enabled
him
to
keep
his
more
turbulent
vices
out
of
sight
impatient
when
a
youth
of
that
contradiction
to
which
he
had
never
been
accustomed
when
a
boy
he
became
notoriously
profligate
his
dissimulation
was
at
length
too
thin
to
conceal
from
his
mistaken
father
his
more
palpable
vices
his
artifices
finally
involved
him
in
a
duel
and
his
premature
death
broke
the
heart
of
my
poor
friend
this
sad
example
led
me
in
my
own
family
to
watch
this
evil
in
the
bud
divines
often
say
that
unbelief
lies
at
the
root
of
all
sin
this
seems
strikingly
true
in
our
conniving
at
the
faults
of
our
children
if
we
really
believed
the
denunciations
of
scripture
could
we
for
the
sake
of
a
momentary
gratification
not
so
much
to
our
child
as
to
ourselves
which
is
the
case
in
all
blamable
indulgence
overlook
that
fault
which
may
be
the
germ
of
unspeakable
miseries
in
my
view
of
things
deceit
is
no
slight
offense
i
feel
myself
answerable
in
no
small
degree
for
the
eternal
happiness
of
these
beloved
creatures
whom
providence
has
especially
committed
to
my
trust
but
it
is
such
a
severe
trial
said
lady
belfield
to
a
fond
parent
to
inflict
voluntary
pain
shall
we
feel
for
their
pain
and
not
for
their
danger
replied
stanley
i
wonder
how
parents
who
love
their
children
as
i
love
mine
can
put
in
competition
a
temporary
indulgence
which
may
foster
one
evil
temper
or
fasten
one
bad
habit
with
the
eternal
welfare
of
that
child
soul
a
soul
of
such
inconceivable
worth
whether
we
consider
its
nature
its
duration
or
the
price
which
was
paid
for
its
redemption
what
parent
i
say
can
by
his
own
rash
negligence
or
false
indulgence
risk
the
happiness
of
such
a
soul
not
for
a
few
days
or
years
but
for
a
period
compared
with
which
the
whole
duration
of
time
is
but
a
point
a
soul
of
such
infinite
faculties
which
has
a
capacity
for
improving
in
holiness
and
happiness
through
all
the
countless
ages
of
eternity
observing
sir
john
listen
with
some
emotion
stanley
went
on
what
remorse
my
dear
friend
can
equal
the
pangs
of
him
who
has
reason
to
believe
that
his
child
has
not
only
lost
this
eternity
of
glory
but
incurred
an
eternity
of
misery
through
the
carelessness
of
that
parent
who
assigned
his
very
fondness
as
a
reason
for
his
neglect
think
of
the
state
of
such
a
father
when
he
figures
to
himself
the
thousands
and
ten
thousands
of
glorified
spirits
that
stand
before
the
throne
and
his
darling
excluded
excluded
perhaps
by
his
own
fondness
oh
my
friends
disguise
it
as
we
may
and
deceive
ourselves
as
we
will
want
of
faith
is
as
much
at
the
bottom
of
this
sin
as
of
all
others
notwithstanding
an
indefinite
indistinct
notion
which
men
call
faith
they
do
not
actually
in
this
eternity
they
believe
it
in
a
general
way
but
they
do
not
believe
in
it
practically
personally
influentially
while
stanley
was
speaking
with
an
energy
which
evinced
how
much
his
own
heart
was
affected
miss
sparkes
by
the
impatience
of
her
looks
evidently
manifested
that
she
wished
to
interrupt
him
good
breeding
however
kept
her
silent
till
he
had
done
speaking
she
then
said
that
though
she
allowed
that
absolute
falsehood
and
falsehood
used
for
mischievous
purposes
was
really
criminal
yet
there
was
a
danger
on
the
other
hand
of
laying
too
severe
restrictions
on
freedom
of
speech
that
there
might
be
such
a
thing
as
tacit
hypocrisy
that
people
might
be
guilty
of
as
much
deceit
by
suppressing
their
sentiments
if
just
as
by
expressing
such
as
were
not
quite
correct
that
a
repulsive
treatment
was
calculated
to
extinguish
the
fire
of
invention
she
thought
also
that
there
were
occasions
where
a
harmless
falsehood
might
not
only
be
pardonable
but
laudable
but
then
she
allowed
that
a
falsehood
to
be
allowed
must
be
inoffensive
stanley
said
that
an
inoffensive
falsehood
was
a
perfect
anomaly
but
allowing
it
possible
that
an
individual
instance
of
deceit
might
be
passed
over
which
however
he
never
could
allow
yet
one
successful
falsehood
on
the
plea
of
doing
good
would
necessarily
make
way
for
another
till
the
limits
which
divide
right
and
wrong
would
be
completely
broken
down
and
every
distinction
between
truth
and
falsehood
be
utterly
confounded
if
such
latitude
were
allowed
even
to
obtain
some
good
purpose
it
would
gradually
debauch
all
human
intercourse
the
smallest
deviation
would
naturally
induce
a
pernicious
habit
endanger
the
security
of
society
and
violate
an
express
law
of
god
there
is
no
tendency
said
sir
john
belfield
more
to
be
guarded
against
among
young
persons
of
warm
hearts
and
lively
imaginations
the
feeling
will
think
falsehood
good
if
it
is
meant
to
good
and
the
fanciful
will
think
it
justifiable
if
it
is
ingenious
ph
oe
be
in
presenting
her
father
with
a
dish
of
coffee
said
in
a
half
whisper
surely
papa
there
can
be
no
harm
in
speaking
falsely
on
a
subject
where
i
am
ignorant
of
the
truth
there
are
occasions
my
dear
ph
oe
be
replied
her
father
in
which
ignorance
itself
is
a
fault
inconsiderateness
is
always
one
it
is
your
duty
to
deliberate
before
you
speak
it
is
your
duty
not
to
deceive
by
your
negligence
in
getting
at
the
truth
or
by
publishing
false
information
as
truth
though
you
have
reason
to
suspect
it
may
be
false
you
well
know
who
it
is
that
associates
him
that
a
lie
with
him
that
it
but
sir
said
miss
sparkes
if
by
a
falsehood
i
could
preserve
a
life
or
save
my
country
falsehood
would
then
be
meritorious
and
i
should
glory
in
deceiving
persons
madam
said
stanley
who
in
debate
have
a
favorite
point
to
carry
are
apt
to
suppose
extreme
cases
which
and
very
rarely
if
ever
occur
this
they
do
in
order
to
compel
the
acquiescence
of
an
opponent
to
what
ought
never
to
be
allowed
it
is
a
proud
and
fruitless
speculation
the
infinite
power
of
god
can
never
stand
in
need
of
the
aid
of
a
weak
mortal
to
help
him
out
in
his
difficulties
if
he
sees
fit
to
preserve
the
life
or
to
save
the
country
he
is
not
driven
to
such
shifts
omnipotence
can
extricate
himself
and
accomplish
his
own
purposes
without
endangering
an
immortal
soul
miss
sparkes
took
her
leave
soon
after
in
order
as
she
said
to
go
to
the
stable
and
take
the
groom
opinion
stanley
insisted
that
her
carriage
should
be
brought
round
to
the
door
to
which
we
all
attended
her
he
inquired
which
was
the
lame
horse
instead
of
answering
she
went
directly
up
to
the
animal
and
after
patting
him
with
some
technical
jockey
phrases
she
fearlessly
took
up
his
hind
leg
carefully
examined
the
foot
and
while
she
continued
standing
in
what
appeared
to
the
ladies
a
perilous
and
to
me
a
disgusting
situation
she
ran
over
all
the
terms
of
the
veterinary
art
with
the
groom
and
when
miss
stanley
expressed
some
fear
of
her
danger
and
some
dislike
of
her
coarseness
she
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
and
slapping
her
on
the
shoulder
asked
her
if
it
was
not
better
to
understand
the
properties
and
diseases
of
so
noble
an
animal
than
to
waste
her
time
in
studying
confectionery
with
old
goody
comfit
or
in
teaching
the
catechism
to
little
ragged
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
the
lively
ph
oe
be
who
her
father
says
has
narrowly
escaped
being
a
wit
herself
cried
out
well
papa
i
must
say
that
i
think
miss
sparkes
with
all
her
faults
is
rather
an
agreeable
woman
i
grant
that
she
is
amusing
returned
he
but
i
do
not
allow
her
to
be
quite
agreeable
between
these
ph
oe
be
there
is
a
wide
distinction
to
a
correct
mind
no
one
can
be
agreeable
who
is
incorrect
propriety
is
so
indispensable
to
agreeableness
that
when
a
lady
allows
herself
to
make
any
even
the
smallest
sacrifice
of
veracity
religion
modesty
candor
or
the
decorum
of
her
sex
she
may
be
shining
she
may
be
showy
she
may
be
amusing
but
she
can
not
properly
speaking
be
agreeable
miss
sparkes
i
very
reluctantly
confess
does
sometimes
make
these
sacrifices
in
a
degree
to
make
her
friends
look
about
them
though
not
in
a
degree
to
alarm
her
own
principles
she
would
not
tell
a
direct
falsehood
for
the
world
she
does
not
indeed
invent
but
she
embellishes
she
enlarges
she
exaggerates
she
discolors
in
her
moral
grammar
there
is
no
positive
or
comparative
degree
pink
with
her
is
scarlet
the
noise
of
a
popgun
is
a
cannon
a
shower
is
a
tempest
a
person
of
small
fortune
is
a
beggar
one
in
easy
circumstances
is
a
cr
oe
sus
a
girl
if
not
perfectly
well
made
is
deformity
personified
if
tolerable
a
grecian
venus
her
favorites
are
angels
her
enemies
demons
she
would
be
thought
very
religious
and
i
hope
that
she
will
one
day
become
so
yet
she
sometimes
treats
serious
things
with
no
small
levity
and
though
she
would
not
originally
say
a
very
bad
word
yet
she
makes
no
scruple
of
repeating
with
great
glee
profane
stories
told
by
others
besides
she
possesses
the
dangerous
art
of
exciting
an
improper
idea
without
using
an
improper
word
gross
indecency
would
shock
her
but
she
often
verges
so
far
toward
indelicacy
as
to
make
stanley
uneasy
then
she
is
too
much
of
a
genius
to
be
tied
down
by
any
consideration
of
prudence
if
a
good
thing
occurs
out
it
comes
without
regard
to
time
or
circumstance
she
would
tell
the
same
story
to
a
bishop
as
to
her
chambermaid
if
she
says
a
right
thing
which
she
often
does
it
is
seldom
in
the
right
place
she
makes
her
way
in
society
without
attaching
many
friends
her
are
admired
and
repeated
yet
i
never
met
with
a
man
of
sense
though
he
may
join
in
flattering
her
who
did
not
declare
as
soon
as
she
was
out
of
the
room
that
he
would
not
for
the
world
that
she
should
be
his
wife
or
daughter
it
is
irksome
to
her
to
converse
with
her
own
sex
while
she
little
suspects
that
ours
is
not
properly
grateful
for
the
preference
with
which
she
honors
us
she
is
continued
stanley
charitable
with
her
purse
but
not
with
her
tongue
she
relieves
her
poor
neighbors
and
indemnifies
herself
by
slandering
her
rich
ones
she
has
however
many
good
qualities
is
generous
feeling
and
humane
and
i
would
on
no
account
speak
so
freely
of
a
lady
whom
i
receive
at
my
house
were
it
not
that
if
i
were
quite
silent
after
ph
oe
be
expressed
admiration
she
might
conclude
that
i
saw
nothing
to
condemn
in
miss
sparkes
and
might
be
copying
her
faults
under
the
notion
that
being
entertaining
made
amends
for
every
thing
chapter
xxxii
one
morning
sir
john
coming
in
from
his
ride
gayly
called
out
to
me
as
i
was
reading
oh
charles
such
a
piece
of
news
the
miss
flams
are
converted
they
have
put
on
tuckers
they
were
at
church
twice
on
sunday
blair
sermons
are
sent
for
and
are
the
reformer
this
ludicrous
address
reminded
stanley
that
flam
had
told
him
we
were
all
in
disgrace
for
not
having
called
on
the
ladies
and
it
was
proposed
to
repair
this
neglect
now
take
notice
said
sir
john
if
you
do
not
see
a
new
character
assumed
thinking
charles
to
be
a
fine
man
of
the
town
the
modish
racket
which
indeed
is
their
natural
state
was
played
off
but
it
did
not
answer
as
they
probably
by
this
time
suspect
your
character
to
be
somewhat
between
the
strephon
and
the
hermit
we
shall
now
in
return
see
something
between
the
and
the
nun
and
i
shall
not
wonder
if
the
extravagantly
modish
miss
bell
is
now
pastora
by
a
fountain
side
though
i
would
not
attribute
the
change
to
the
cause
assigned
by
sir
john
yet
i
confess
we
found
when
we
made
our
visit
no
small
revolution
in
miss
bell
flam
the
part
of
the
arcadian
nymph
the
reading
lady
the
lover
of
retirement
the
sentimental
admirer
of
domestic
life
the
censurer
of
thoughtless
dissipation
was
each
acted
in
succession
but
so
skillfully
touched
that
the
shades
of
each
melted
in
the
other
without
any
of
those
violent
transitions
which
a
less
experienced
actress
would
have
exhibited
sir
john
slyly
yet
with
affected
gravity
assisting
her
to
sustain
this
newly
adapted
character
which
however
he
was
sure
would
last
no
longer
than
the
visit
when
we
returned
home
we
met
the
miss
stanleys
in
the
garden
and
joined
them
do
you
admire
said
sir
john
the
versatility
of
miss
genius
you
charles
are
not
the
first
man
on
whom
an
assumed
fondness
for
rural
delights
has
been
practiced
a
friend
of
mine
was
drawn
in
to
marry
rather
suddenly
a
lady
by
her
repeated
declarations
of
her
passionate
fondness
for
the
country
and
the
rapture
she
expressed
when
rural
scenery
was
the
subject
all
she
knew
of
the
country
was
that
she
had
now
and
then
been
on
a
party
of
pleasure
at
richmond
in
the
fine
summer
months
a
great
dinner
at
the
star
and
garter
gay
company
a
bright
day
lovely
scenery
a
dance
on
the
green
a
partner
to
her
taste
french
horns
on
the
water
altogether
constituted
a
feeling
of
pleasure
from
which
she
had
really
persuaded
herself
that
she
was
fond
of
the
country
but
when
all
these
concomitants
were
withdrawn
when
she
had
lost
the
gay
partner
the
dance
the
horns
the
flattery
and
the
frolic
and
nothing
was
left
but
her
books
her
own
dull
mansion
her
domestic
employments
and
the
sober
society
of
her
husband
the
pastoral
vision
vanished
she
discovered
or
rather
discovered
but
too
late
that
the
country
had
not
only
no
charms
for
her
but
that
it
was
a
scene
of
constant
ennui
and
vapid
dullness
she
languished
for
the
pleasures
she
had
quitted
and
he
for
the
comforts
he
had
lost
opposite
inclinations
led
to
opposite
pursuits
difference
of
taste
however
needed
not
to
have
led
to
a
total
disunion
had
there
been
on
the
part
of
the
lady
such
a
degree
of
attachment
as
might
have
induced
a
spirit
of
accommodation
or
such
a
fund
of
principle
as
might
have
taught
her
the
necessity
of
making
those
sacrifices
which
affection
had
it
existed
would
have
rendered
pleasant
or
duty
would
have
made
light
had
she
been
early
taught
lucilla
smiling
said
she
hoped
sir
john
had
a
little
the
picture
he
defended
himself
by
declaring
he
drew
from
the
life
and
that
from
his
long
observations
he
could
present
us
with
a
whole
gallery
of
such
portraits
he
left
me
to
continue
my
walk
with
the
two
miss
stanleys
the
more
i
conversed
with
lucilla
the
more
i
saw
that
good
breeding
in
her
was
only
the
outward
expression
of
humility
and
not
an
art
employed
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
her
to
do
without
it
we
continued
to
converse
on
the
subject
of
miss
flam
fondness
for
the
gay
world
this
introduced
a
natural
expression
of
my
admiration
of
miss
choice
of
pleasures
and
pursuits
so
different
from
those
of
most
other
women
of
her
age
with
the
most
graceful
modesty
she
said
nothing
humbles
me
more
than
compliments
for
when
i
compare
what
i
hear
with
what
i
feel
i
find
the
picture
of
myself
drawn
by
a
flattering
friend
so
utterly
unlike
the
original
in
my
own
heart
that
i
am
more
sunk
by
my
own
consciousness
of
the
want
of
resemblance
than
elated
that
another
has
not
discovered
it
it
makes
me
feel
like
an
imposter
if
i
contradict
this
favorable
opinion
i
am
afraid
of
being
accused
of
affectation
and
if
i
silently
swallow
it
i
am
contributing
to
the
deceit
of
passing
for
what
i
am
not
this
ingenious
mode
of
disclaiming
flattery
only
raised
her
in
my
esteem
and
the
more
as
i
told
her
such
humble
renunciation
of
praise
could
only
proceed
from
that
inward
principle
of
genuine
piety
and
devout
feeling
which
made
so
amiable
a
part
of
her
character
how
little
said
she
is
the
human
heart
known
except
to
him
who
made
it
while
a
fellow
creature
may
admire
our
apparent
devotion
he
who
appears
to
be
its
object
witnesses
the
wandering
of
the
heart
which
seems
to
be
lifted
up
to
him
he
sees
it
roving
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
busied
about
any
thing
rather
than
himself
running
after
trifles
which
would
not
only
dishonor
christian
but
would
disgrace
a
child
as
to
my
very
virtues
if
i
dare
apply
such
a
word
to
myself
they
sometimes
lose
their
character
by
not
keeping
their
proper
place
they
become
sins
by
infringing
on
higher
duties
if
i
mean
to
perform
an
act
of
devotion
some
crude
plan
of
charity
forces
itself
on
my
mind
and
what
with
trying
to
drive
out
one
and
to
establish
the
other
i
rise
dissatisfied
and
unimproved
and
resting
my
sole
hope
not
on
the
duty
i
have
been
performing
but
on
the
mercy
i
have
been
offending
i
assured
her
with
all
the
simplicity
of
truth
and
all
the
sincerity
of
affection
that
this
confession
only
served
to
raise
my
opinion
of
the
piety
she
disclaimed
that
such
deep
consciousness
of
imperfection
so
quick
a
discernment
of
the
slightest
deviation
and
such
constant
vigilance
to
prevent
it
were
the
truest
indications
of
an
humble
spirit
and
that
those
who
thus
carefully
guarded
themselves
against
small
errors
were
in
little
danger
of
being
betrayed
into
great
ones
she
replied
smiling
that
she
should
not
be
so
angry
with
vanity
if
it
would
be
contented
to
keep
its
proper
place
among
its
vices
but
her
quarrel
with
it
was
that
it
would
mix
itself
among
our
virtues
and
rob
us
of
their
reward
vanity
indeed
replied
i
differs
from
the
other
vices
in
this
commonly
are
only
opposite
to
the
one
contrary
virtue
while
this
vice
has
a
kind
of
ubiquity
is
on
the
watch
to
intrude
everywhere
and
weakens
all
the
virtues
which
it
can
not
destroy
i
believe
vanity
was
the
harpy
of
the
ancient
poets
which
they
tell
us
tainted
whatever
it
touched
is
so
easy
replied
miss
stanley
that
i
am
even
afraid
of
highly
extolling
any
good
quality
lest
i
should
sit
down
satisfied
with
having
borne
any
testimony
in
its
favor
and
so
rest
contented
with
the
praise
instead
of
the
practise
commending
a
right
thing
is
a
cheap
substitute
for
doing
it
with
which
we
are
too
apt
to
satisfy
ourselves
there
is
no
mark
i
replied
which
more
clearly
distinguishes
that
humility
which
has
the
love
of
god
for
its
principle
from
its
counterfeit
a
false
and
superficial
politeness
than
that
while
this
last
flatters
in
order
to
extort
in
return
more
praise
than
its
due
humility
like
the
divine
principle
from
which
it
springs
seeketh
not
even
its
own
in
answer
to
some
further
remark
of
mine
with
an
air
of
infinite
modesty
she
said
i
have
been
betrayed
sir
into
saying
too
much
it
will
i
trust
however
have
the
good
effect
of
preventing
you
from
thinking
better
of
me
than
i
deserve
in
general
i
hold
it
indiscreet
to
speak
of
the
state
of
one
mind
i
have
been
taught
this
piece
of
prudence
by
my
own
indiscretion
i
once
lamented
to
a
lady
the
fault
of
which
we
have
now
been
speaking
and
observed
how
difficult
it
was
to
keep
the
heart
right
she
so
little
understood
the
nature
of
this
inward
corruption
that
she
told
in
confidence
to
two
or
three
friends
that
they
were
all
much
mistaken
in
miss
stanley
for
though
her
character
stood
so
fair
with
all
the
world
she
had
secretly
confessed
to
her
that
she
was
a
great
sinner
i
could
not
forbear
repeating
though
she
had
chid
me
for
it
before
how
much
i
had
been
struck
with
several
instances
of
her
indifference
to
the
work
and
her
superiority
to
its
pleasures
do
you
know
continued
she
smiling
that
you
are
more
my
enemy
than
the
lady
of
whom
i
have
been
speaking
she
only
defamed
my
principles
but
you
are
corrupting
them
the
world
i
believe
is
not
so
much
a
place
as
a
nature
it
is
possible
to
be
religious
in
a
court
and
worldly
in
a
monastery
i
find
that
the
thoughts
may
be
engaged
too
anxiously
about
so
petty
a
concern
as
a
little
family
arrangement
that
the
mind
may
be
drawn
off
from
better
pursuits
and
engrossed
by
things
too
trivial
to
name
as
much
as
by
objects
more
apparently
wrong
the
country
is
certainly
favorable
to
religion
but
it
would
be
hard
on
the
millions
who
are
doomed
to
live
in
towns
if
it
were
exclusively
favorable
nor
must
we
lay
more
stress
on
the
accidental
circumstance
than
it
deserves
nay
i
almost
doubt
if
it
is
not
too
pleasant
to
be
quite
safe
an
enjoyment
which
assumes
a
sober
shape
may
deceive
us
by
making
us
believe
we
are
practicing
a
duty
when
we
are
only
gratifying
a
taste
but
do
you
not
think
said
i
that
there
may
be
merit
in
the
taste
itself
may
not
a
succession
of
acts
forming
a
habit
and
that
habit
a
good
one
induce
so
sound
a
way
of
thinking
that
it
may
become
difficult
to
distinguish
the
duty
from
the
taste
and
to
separate
the
principle
from
the
choice
this
i
really
believe
to
be
the
case
in
minds
finely
wrought
and
vigilantly
watched
i
observed
that
however
delightful
the
country
might
be
a
great
part
of
the
year
yet
there
were
a
few
winter
months
when
i
feared
it
might
be
dull
though
not
in
the
degree
sir
john
richmond
lady
found
it
with
a
smile
of
compassion
at
my
want
of
taste
she
said
she
perceived
i
was
no
gardener
to
me
added
she
the
winter
has
charms
of
its
own
if
i
were
not
afraid
of
the
light
habit
of
introducing
providence
on
an
occasion
not
sufficiently
important
i
would
say
that
he
seems
to
reward
those
who
love
the
country
well
enough
to
live
in
it
the
whole
year
by
making
the
greater
part
of
the
winter
the
busy
season
for
gardening
operations
if
i
happen
to
be
in
town
a
few
days
only
every
sun
that
shines
every
shower
that
falls
every
breeze
that
blows
seems
wasted
because
i
do
not
see
their
effects
upon
my
plants
but
surely
said
i
the
winter
at
least
suspends
your
enjoyment
there
is
little
pleasure
in
contemplating
vegetation
in
its
torpid
state
in
surveying
the
naked
shoots
barren
as
lances
as
cowper
describes
the
the
pleasure
is
in
the
preparation
replied
she
when
all
appears
dead
and
torpid
to
you
idle
spectators
all
is
secretly
at
work
nature
is
busy
in
preparing
her
treasures
under
ground
and
art
has
a
hand
in
the
process
when
the
blossoms
of
summer
are
delighting
you
mere
amateurs
then
it
is
that
we
professional
people
added
she
laughing
are
really
idle
the
silent
operations
of
the
winter
now
produce
themselves
the
canvas
of
nature
is
covered
the
great
artist
has
laid
on
his
colors
then
we
petty
agents
lay
down
our
implements
and
enjoy
our
leisure
in
contemplating
work
i
had
never
known
her
so
communicative
but
my
pleased
attention
instead
of
drawing
her
on
led
her
to
check
herself
ph
oe
be
who
had
been
busily
employed
in
trimming
a
flaunting
yellow
azalia
now
turned
to
me
and
said
why
it
is
only
the
that
our
labors
are
suspended
and
then
we
have
so
much
pleasure
that
we
want
no
business
such
festivities
and
diversions
that
that
dull
month
is
with
us
the
gayest
in
the
year
so
saying
she
called
lucilla
to
assist
her
in
tying
up
the
branch
of
an
which
the
wind
had
broken
i
was
going
to
offer
my
services
when
stanley
joined
us
before
i
could
obtain
an
answer
to
my
question
about
these
christmas
diversions
a
stranger
who
had
seen
me
pursuing
stanley
in
her
walks
might
have
supposed
not
the
daughter
but
the
mother
was
the
object
of
my
attachment
but
with
stanley
i
could
always
talk
of
lucilla
with
lucilla
i
durst
not
often
talk
of
herself
the
fond
mother
and
i
stood
looking
with
delight
on
the
fair
gardeners
when
i
had
admired
their
alacrity
in
these
innocent
pursuits
their
fondness
for
retirement
and
their
cheerful
delight
in
its
pleasures
stanley
replied
yes
lucilla
is
half
a
nun
she
likes
the
rule
but
not
the
vow
poor
thing
her
conscience
is
so
tender
that
she
oftener
requires
encouragement
than
restraint
while
she
was
making
this
plantation
she
felt
herself
so
absorbed
by
it
that
she
came
to
me
one
day
and
said
that
her
gardening
work
so
fascinated
her
that
she
found
whole
hours
passed
unperceived
and
she
began
to
be
uneasy
by
observing
that
all
cares
and
all
duties
were
suspended
while
she
was
disposing
beds
of
carnations
or
knots
of
anemones
even
when
she
tore
herself
away
and
returned
to
her
employments
her
flowers
still
pursued
her
and
the
improvement
of
her
mind
gave
way
to
the
cultivation
of
her
geraniums
am
afraid
said
the
poor
girl
i
must
really
give
it
up
i
would
not
hear
of
this
i
would
not
suffer
her
to
deny
herself
so
pure
a
pleasure
she
then
suggested
the
expedient
of
limiting
her
time
and
hanging
up
her
watch
in
the
conservatory
to
keep
her
within
her
prescribed
bounds
she
is
so
observant
of
this
restriction
that
when
her
allotted
time
is
expired
she
forces
herself
to
leave
off
even
in
the
midst
of
the
most
interesting
operation
by
this
limitation
a
treble
end
is
answered
her
time
is
saved
is
exercised
and
the
interest
which
would
languish
by
protracting
the
work
is
kept
in
fresh
vigor
i
told
stanley
that
i
had
observed
her
watch
hanging
in
a
the
day
i
came
but
little
thought
it
had
a
moral
meaning
she
said
it
had
never
been
left
there
since
i
had
been
in
the
house
for
fear
of
causing
interrogatories
here
stanley
left
me
to
my
meditations
it
is
wisely
ordered
that
all
mortal
enjoyments
should
have
some
alloy
i
never
tasted
a
pleasure
since
i
had
been
at
the
grove
i
never
witnessed
a
grace
i
never
heard
related
an
excellence
of
lucilla
without
a
sigh
that
my
beloved
parents
did
not
share
my
happiness
how
would
they
said
i
delight
in
her
delicacy
rejoice
in
her
piety
love
her
benevolence
her
humility
her
usefulness
o
how
do
children
feel
who
wound
the
peace
of
parents
by
an
unworthy
choice
when
not
a
little
of
my
comfort
springs
from
the
certainty
that
the
departed
would
rejoice
in
mine
even
from
their
blessed
abode
my
grateful
heart
seems
to
hear
them
say
is
the
creature
we
would
have
chosen
for
thee
this
is
the
creature
with
whom
we
shall
rejoice
with
thee
through
all
eternity
yet
such
was
my
inconsistency
that
charmed
as
i
was
that
so
young
and
lovely
a
woman
could
be
so
cheaply
pleased
and
delighted
with
that
simplicity
of
taste
which
made
her
resemble
my
favorite
heroine
of
milton
in
her
amusements
as
well
as
in
her
domestic
pursuits
yet
i
longed
to
know
what
these
christmas
diversions
so
slightly
hinted
at
could
be
diversions
which
could
reconcile
these
girls
to
their
absence
not
only
from
their
but
from
london
i
could
hardly
fear
indeed
to
find
at
stanley
grove
what
the
newspapers
pertly
call
still
i
suspected
it
might
be
some
gay
dissipation
not
quite
suited
to
their
general
character
nor
congenial
to
their
usual
amusements
my
mother
favorite
rule
of
strongly
forced
itself
on
my
mind
though
i
tried
to
repel
the
suggestion
as
unjust
and
ungenerous
of
what
meannesses
will
not
love
be
guilty
it
drove
me
to
have
recourse
to
my
friend
comfit
to
dissipate
my
doubts
from
her
i
learned
that
that
cold
and
comfortless
season
was
mitigated
at
stanley
grove
by
several
feasts
for
the
poor
of
different
classes
and
ages
then
sir
continued
she
if
you
could
see
the
blazing
fires
and
the
abundant
provisions
the
roasting
and
the
boiling
and
the
baking
the
house
is
all
alive
on
those
days
the
drawers
and
shelves
of
miss
are
completely
emptied
is
the
most
delightful
bustle
sir
to
see
our
young
ladies
tying
on
the
good
women
warm
cloaks
fitting
their
caps
and
aprons
and
sending
home
blankets
to
the
infirm
who
can
not
come
themselves
the
very
little
ones
kneeling
down
on
the
ground
to
try
on
the
poor
girls
shoes
even
little
miss
celia
and
she
is
so
tender
to
fit
them
exactly
and
not
hurt
them
last
not
finding
a
pair
small
enough
for
a
poor
little
girl
she
privately
slipped
off
her
own
and
put
on
the
child
it
was
some
time
before
it
was
discovered
that
she
herself
was
without
shoes
we
are
all
alive
sir
parlor
and
hall
and
kitchen
all
is
in
motion
books
and
business
and
walks
and
gardening
all
are
forgot
for
these
few
happy
days
how
i
hated
myself
for
my
suspicion
and
how
i
loved
the
charming
creatures
who
could
find
in
these
humble
but
exhilarating
duties
an
equivalent
for
the
pleasures
of
the
metropolis
surely
said
i
to
myself
my
mother
would
call
consistency
when
the
amusements
of
a
religious
family
smack
of
the
same
flavor
with
its
business
and
its
duties
my
heart
was
more
than
easy
it
was
dilated
while
i
congratulated
myself
in
the
thought
that
there
young
ladies
to
be
found
who
could
spend
a
winter
not
only
unrepiningly
but
cheerfully
and
delightedly
in
the
country
i
am
aware
that
were
i
to
repeat
my
conversations
with
lucilla
i
should
subject
myself
to
ridicule
by
recording
such
cold
and
spiritless
discourse
on
my
own
part
but
i
had
not
yet
declared
my
attachment
i
made
it
a
point
of
duty
not
to
violate
my
engagement
with
stanley
i
was
not
addressing
declarations
but
studying
the
character
of
her
on
whom
the
happiness
of
my
life
was
to
depend
i
had
resolved
not
to
show
my
attachment
by
any
overt
act
i
confined
the
expression
of
my
affection
to
that
of
small
quiet
which
an
accurate
judge
of
the
human
heart
has
pronounced
to
be
the
surest
avenue
to
a
delicate
mind
i
had
in
the
mean
time
the
inexpressible
felicity
to
observe
a
constant
union
of
feeling
as
well
as
a
general
consonance
of
opinion
between
us
every
sentiment
seemed
a
reciprocation
of
sympathy
and
every
look
of
intelligence
this
unstudied
correspondence
enchanted
me
the
more
as
i
had
always
considered
that
a
conformity
of
tastes
was
nearly
as
necessary
to
conjugal
happiness
as
a
conformity
of
principles
chapter
xxxiii
one
morning
i
took
a
ride
alone
to
breakfast
at
lady
aston
stanley
having
expressed
a
particular
desire
that
i
should
cultivate
the
acquaintance
of
her
son
sir
george
is
not
quite
twenty
said
he
and
your
being
a
few
years
older
will
make
him
consider
your
friendship
as
an
honor
to
him
i
am
sure
it
will
be
an
advantage
in
her
own
little
family
circle
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
lady
aston
appear
to
more
advantage
than
i
had
yet
done
her
understanding
is
good
and
her
affections
are
strong
she
had
received
a
too
favorable
impression
of
my
character
from
stanley
and
treated
me
with
as
much
openness
as
if
i
had
been
his
son
the
gentle
girls
animated
by
the
spirit
of
their
brother
seemed
to
derive
both
happiness
and
importance
from
his
presence
while
the
amiable
young
baronet
himself
won
my
affection
by
his
engaging
manners
and
my
esteem
by
his
good
sense
and
his
considerable
acquirements
in
every
thing
which
becomes
a
gentleman
this
visit
exemplified
a
remark
i
had
sometimes
made
that
shy
characters
who
from
natural
timidity
are
reserved
in
general
society
open
themselves
with
peculiar
warmth
and
frankness
to
a
few
select
friends
or
to
an
individual
of
whom
they
think
kindly
a
distant
manner
is
not
always
as
is
suspected
the
result
of
a
cold
heart
or
a
dull
head
nor
is
gayety
necessarily
connected
with
feeling
high
animal
spirits
though
they
often
evaporate
in
mere
talk
yet
by
their
warmth
and
quickness
of
motion
obtain
the
credit
of
strong
sensibility
a
sensibility
however
of
which
the
heart
is
not
always
the
fountain
while
in
the
timid
that
silence
which
is
construed
into
pride
indifference
or
want
of
capacity
is
often
the
effect
of
keen
feelings
friendship
is
the
genial
climate
in
which
such
hearts
disclose
themselves
they
flourish
in
the
shade
and
kindness
alone
makes
them
expand
a
keen
discerner
will
often
detect
in
such
characters
qualities
which
are
not
always
connected
with
the
rattling
tongue
of
saucy
and
audacious
eloquence
when
people
who
have
seen
little
of
each
other
are
thrown
together
nothing
brings
on
free
communication
so
quickly
or
so
pleasantly
as
their
being
both
intimate
with
a
third
person
for
whom
all
parties
entertain
one
common
sentiment
stanley
seemed
always
a
point
of
union
between
his
neighbors
and
me
after
various
topics
had
been
discussed
lady
aston
remarked
that
she
could
now
trace
the
goodness
of
providence
in
having
so
ordered
events
as
to
make
those
things
which
she
had
so
much
dreaded
at
the
time
work
out
advantages
which
could
not
have
been
otherwise
obtained
for
her
i
had
a
singular
aversion
added
she
to
the
thoughts
of
removing
to
this
place
and
quitting
sir
george
estate
in
warwickshire
where
i
had
spent
the
happiest
years
of
my
life
when
i
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
him
here
a
tear
quietly
strayed
down
her
cheek
i
resolved
never
to
remove
from
the
place
where
he
died
i
had
fully
persuaded
myself
that
it
was
a
duty
to
do
all
i
could
to
cherish
grief
i
obliged
myself
as
a
law
to
spend
whole
hours
in
walking
round
the
place
where
he
was
buried
these
melancholy
visits
the
intervals
of
which
were
filled
with
tears
prayers
and
reading
a
few
good
but
not
well
chosen
books
made
up
the
whole
round
of
my
sad
existence
i
had
nearly
forgotten
that
i
had
any
duties
to
perform
any
mercies
left
almost
all
the
effect
which
the
sight
of
my
children
produced
in
me
was
by
their
resemblance
to
their
father
to
put
me
in
mind
of
what
i
had
lost
i
was
not
sufficiently
aware
how
much
more
truly
i
should
have
honored
his
memory
by
training
his
living
representatives
in
such
a
manner
as
he
had
he
been
living
would
have
approved
my
dear
george
added
she
smiling
at
her
son
through
her
tears
was
glad
to
get
away
to
school
and
my
poor
girls
when
they
lost
the
company
of
their
brother
lost
all
the
little
cheerfulness
which
my
recluse
habits
had
left
them
we
sunk
into
total
inaction
and
our
lives
became
as
comfortless
as
they
were
unprofitable
my
dear
madam
said
sir
george
in
the
most
affectionate
tone
and
manner
i
can
only
forgive
myself
from
the
consideration
of
my
being
then
too
young
and
thoughtless
to
know
the
value
of
the
mother
whose
sorrows
ought
to
have
endeared
my
home
to
me
instead
of
driving
me
from
it
they
are
faults
my
dear
george
and
not
yours
that
i
am
relating
few
mothers
would
have
acted
like
me
few
sons
differently
from
you
your
affectionate
heart
deserved
a
warmer
return
than
my
broken
spirits
were
capable
of
making
you
but
i
was
telling
you
sir
said
she
again
addressing
herself
to
me
that
the
event
of
my
coming
to
this
place
not
only
became
the
source
of
my
present
peace
and
of
the
comfort
of
my
children
but
that
its
result
enables
me
to
look
forward
with
a
cheerful
hope
to
that
state
where
there
is
neither
sin
sorrow
nor
separation
the
thoughts
of
death
which
used
to
render
me
useless
now
make
me
only
serious
the
reflection
that
night
cometh
which
used
to
extinguish
my
activity
now
kindles
it
forgive
me
sir
added
she
wiping
her
eyes
these
are
not
such
tears
as
i
then
shed
these
are
tears
of
gratitude
i
had
almost
said
of
joy
in
the
family
at
the
grove
providence
had
been
providing
for
me
friends
for
whom
i
doubt
not
i
shall
bless
him
in
eternity
i
had
long
been
convinced
of
the
importance
of
religion
i
had
always
felt
the
insufficiency
of
the
world
to
bestow
happiness
but
i
had
never
before
beheld
religion
in
such
a
form
i
had
never
been
furnished
with
a
proper
substitute
for
the
worldly
pleasures
which
i
yet
despised
i
did
right
in
giving
up
diversions
but
i
did
wrong
in
giving
up
employment
and
in
neglecting
duties
i
knew
something
of
religion
as
a
principle
of
fear
but
i
had
no
conception
of
it
as
a
motive
to
the
love
of
god
and
of
active
duty
nor
did
i
consider
it
as
a
source
of
inward
peace
books
had
not
been
of
any
great
service
to
me
for
i
had
no
one
to
guide
me
in
the
choice
or
to
assist
me
in
the
perusal
i
went
to
my
daily
task
of
devotion
with
a
heavy
heart
and
returned
from
it
with
no
other
sense
of
comfort
but
that
i
had
not
omitted
it
my
former
friends
and
acquaintance
had
been
decent
and
regular
but
they
had
adopted
religion
as
a
form
and
not
as
a
principle
it
was
compliance
and
not
conviction
it
was
conformity
to
custom
and
not
the
persuasion
of
the
heart
judge
then
how
i
must
have
been
affected
in
a
state
when
sorrow
and
disappointment
had
made
my
mind
peculiarly
impressible
with
the
conversation
and
example
of
and
stanley
i
saw
in
them
that
religion
was
not
a
formal
profession
but
a
powerful
principle
it
ran
through
their
whole
life
and
character
all
the
christian
graces
were
brought
into
action
in
a
way
with
a
uniformity
and
a
beauty
which
nothing
but
christian
motives
could
have
effected
the
change
which
took
place
in
my
own
mind
however
was
progressive
the
strict
consonance
which
i
observed
between
their
sentiments
and
actions
and
those
of
barlow
and
jackson
strengthened
and
confirmed
mine
this
similarity
in
all
points
was
a
fresh
confirmation
that
they
were
all
right
the
light
of
religion
gradually
grew
stronger
and
the
way
more
smooth
it
was
literally
a
to
my
feet
for
i
walked
more
safely
as
i
saw
more
clearly
my
difficulties
insensibly
lessened
and
my
doubts
disappeared
i
still
indeed
continue
hourly
to
feel
much
cause
to
be
humbled
but
none
to
be
unhappy
when
lady
aston
had
done
speaking
sir
george
said
i
owe
a
thousand
obligations
to
my
mother
but
not
one
so
great
as
her
introduction
of
me
to
stanley
he
has
given
a
bent
and
bias
to
my
sentiments
habit
and
pursuits
to
which
i
trust
every
day
will
add
fresh
strength
i
look
up
to
him
as
my
model
happy
if
i
may
in
any
degree
be
able
to
form
myself
by
it
till
i
had
the
happiness
of
knowing
you
sir
i
preferred
the
company
of
barlow
and
stanley
to
that
of
any
man
with
whom
i
am
acquainted
after
some
further
conversation
in
which
sir
george
with
great
credit
to
himself
bore
a
considerable
part
miss
aston
took
courage
to
ask
me
if
i
would
accompany
them
all
into
the
garden
as
she
wished
me
to
carry
home
intelligence
to
miss
stanley
of
the
flourishing
state
of
some
american
plants
which
had
been
raised
under
her
direction
to
speak
the
truth
i
had
for
some
time
been
trying
to
bring
lucilla
on
the
tapis
but
had
not
found
a
plausible
pretense
i
now
inquired
if
miss
stanley
directed
their
gardening
pursuits
she
directs
our
pursuits
said
the
two
bashful
blushing
girls
who
now
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
spoke
both
at
once
the
subject
kindling
an
energy
in
their
affectionate
hearts
which
even
their
timidity
could
not
rein
in
i
thought
clara
said
sir
george
that
miss
oe
stanley
too
had
assisted
in
laying
out
the
flower
garden
surely
she
is
not
behind
her
sister
in
any
thing
that
is
kind
or
any
thing
that
is
elegant
his
complexion
heightened
as
he
spoke
and
he
expressed
himself
with
an
emphasis
which
i
had
not
before
observed
in
his
manner
of
speaking
i
stole
a
glance
at
lady
aston
whose
meek
eye
glistened
with
pleasure
at
the
earnestness
with
which
her
son
spoke
of
the
lovely
ph
oe
be
my
rapid
imagination
instantly
shot
forward
to
an
event
which
some
years
hence
will
probably
unite
two
families
so
worthy
of
each
other
lady
aston
who
already
honors
me
with
her
confidence
afterward
confirmed
my
suspicions
on
a
subject
about
which
nothing
but
the
extreme
youth
of
both
parties
made
her
backward
to
express
the
secret
hope
she
fondly
entertained
in
our
walk
round
the
gardens
the
miss
astons
continued
to
vie
with
each
other
who
should
be
warmest
in
the
praise
of
their
young
friends
at
the
grove
to
miss
stanley
they
gratefully
declared
they
owed
any
little
taste
knowledge
or
love
of
goodness
which
they
themselves
might
possess
it
was
delightful
to
observe
these
quiet
girls
warmed
and
excited
by
a
subject
so
interesting
i
was
charmed
to
see
them
so
far
from
feeling
any
shadow
of
envy
at
the
avowed
superiority
of
their
young
friends
and
so
unanimously
eloquent
in
the
praise
of
merit
so
eclipsing
after
having
admired
the
plants
of
which
i
promised
to
make
a
favorable
report
i
was
charged
with
a
large
and
beautiful
bouquet
for
the
young
ladies
at
the
grove
they
then
drew
me
to
the
prettiest
spot
in
the
grounds
while
i
was
admiring
it
miss
clara
with
a
blush
and
some
hesitation
begged
leave
to
ask
my
advice
about
a
little
rustic
building
which
she
and
her
sisters
were
just
going
to
raise
in
honor
of
the
miss
stanleys
it
was
to
be
dedicated
to
them
and
called
the
temple
of
friendship
my
brother
said
she
is
kindly
assisting
us
the
materials
are
all
prepared
and
we
have
now
only
to
fix
them
up
she
then
put
into
my
hands
a
little
plan
i
highly
approved
it
venturing
however
to
suggest
some
trifling
alteration
which
i
told
them
i
did
in
order
to
implicate
myself
a
little
in
the
pleasant
project
how
proud
was
i
when
clara
added
that
miss
stanley
had
expressed
a
high
opinion
of
my
general
taste
they
all
begged
me
to
look
in
on
them
in
my
rides
and
assist
them
with
my
further
counsel
adding
that
above
all
things
i
must
keep
it
a
secret
at
the
grove
lady
aston
said
that
she
expected
our
whole
party
to
dine
at
the
hall
some
day
next
week
her
daughters
entreated
that
it
might
be
postponed
till
the
latter
end
by
which
time
they
doubted
not
their
little
edifice
would
be
completed
sir
george
then
told
me
that
his
sisters
had
requested
him
to
furnish
an
inscription
or
to
endeavor
to
procure
one
from
me
he
added
his
wishes
to
theirs
that
i
would
comply
they
all
joined
so
earnestly
in
the
entreaty
that
i
could
not
withstand
them
albeit
unused
to
the
mood
after
some
deliberation
friday
in
the
next
week
was
fixed
upon
for
the
party
at
the
grove
to
dine
at
and
i
was
to
carry
the
invitation
i
took
a
respectful
leave
of
the
excellent
lady
of
the
mansion
and
an
affectionate
one
of
the
young
people
with
whom
the
familiar
intercourse
of
this
quiet
morning
had
contributed
to
advance
my
friendly
acquaintance
more
than
could
have
been
done
by
many
ceremonious
meetings
when
i
returned
to
the
grove
which
was
but
just
in
time
to
dress
for
dinner
i
spoke
with
sincere
satisfaction
of
the
manner
in
which
i
had
passed
the
morning
it
was
beautiful
to
observe
the
honest
delight
the
ingenuous
kindness
with
which
lucilla
heard
me
commend
the
miss
astons
no
little
disparaging
hint
on
the
one
hand
gently
to
let
down
her
friends
nor
on
the
other
no
such
exaggerated
praise
as
i
have
sometimes
seen
employed
as
a
screen
for
envy
or
as
a
trap
to
make
the
hearer
lower
what
the
speaker
had
too
highly
raised
i
dropped
in
at
two
or
three
times
in
the
course
of
the
week
as
well
to
notice
the
progress
of
the
work
as
to
carry
my
inscription
in
which
as
lucilla
was
both
the
subject
and
the
muse
i
succeeded
rather
better
than
i
expected
on
the
friday
according
to
appointment
our
whole
party
went
to
dine
at
the
hall
in
our
way
stanley
expressed
the
pleasure
it
gave
him
that
lady
aston
was
now
so
convinced
of
the
duty
of
making
home
agreeable
to
her
son
as
delightfully
to
receive
such
of
her
friends
as
were
warmly
disposed
to
become
his
sir
george
who
is
extremely
well
bred
did
the
honors
admirably
for
so
young
a
man
to
the
great
relief
of
his
excellent
mother
whom
long
retirement
had
rendered
habitually
timid
in
a
party
of
which
some
were
almost
strangers
the
miss
astons
had
some
difficulty
to
restrain
their
young
guests
from
running
directly
to
look
at
the
progress
of
the
american
plants
but
as
they
grew
near
the
mysterious
spot
they
were
not
allowed
to
approach
it
before
the
allotted
time
after
dinner
when
the
whole
party
were
walking
in
the
garden
lady
aston
was
desired
by
her
daughters
to
conduct
her
company
to
a
winding
near
the
little
building
but
from
whence
it
was
not
visible
while
they
were
all
waiting
at
the
appointed
place
the
two
elder
miss
astons
gravely
took
a
hand
of
lucilla
sir
george
and
i
each
presented
a
hand
to
ph
oe
be
and
in
profound
silence
and
great
ceremony
we
led
them
up
the
turf
steps
into
this
simple
but
really
pretty
temple
the
initials
of
lucilla
and
ph
oe
be
were
carved
in
cypher
over
a
little
rustic
window
under
which
was
written
sacred
to
friendship
in
two
niches
prepared
for
the
purpose
we
severally
seated
the
two
astonished
nymphs
who
seemed
absolutely
enchanted
above
was
the
inscription
in
large
roman
letters
the
astons
looked
so
much
alive
that
they
might
have
been
mistaken
for
stanleys
who
in
their
turn
were
so
affected
with
this
tender
mark
of
friendship
that
they
looked
as
tearful
as
if
they
had
been
astons
after
reading
the
inscription
my
dear
clara
said
lucilla
to
miss
aston
where
you
get
these
beautiful
verses
though
the
praise
they
convey
is
too
flattering
to
be
just
it
is
too
delicate
not
to
please
the
lines
are
at
once
tender
and
elegant
we
got
them
said
miss
aston
with
a
sweet
vivacity
where
we
get
every
thing
that
is
good
from
bowing
modestly
to
me
how
was
i
elated
and
how
did
lucilla
blush
but
though
she
now
tried
to
qualify
her
flattery
she
could
not
recall
it
and
i
would
not
allow
myself
to
be
robbed
of
the
delight
it
had
given
me
all
the
company
seemed
to
enjoy
her
confusion
and
my
pleasure
i
forgot
to
mention
that
as
we
crossed
the
park
we
had
seen
enter
the
house
through
a
back
avenue
a
procession
of
little
girls
neatly
dressed
in
a
uniform
in
a
whisper
i
asked
lady
aston
what
it
meant
you
are
to
know
replied
her
ladyship
that
my
daughters
adopt
all
miss
stanley
plans
and
among
the
rest
that
of
associating
with
all
their
own
indulgences
some
little
act
of
charity
that
while
they
are
receiving
pleasure
they
may
also
be
conferring
it
the
opening
of
the
temple
of
friendship
is
likely
to
afford
too
much
gratification
to
be
passed
over
without
some
such
association
so
my
girls
give
a
little
feast
with
prizes
of
merit
to
their
and
a
few
other
deserving
young
persons
when
we
had
taken
our
seats
in
the
temple
ph
oe
be
suddenly
cried
out
clasping
her
hands
in
an
ecstacy
only
look
lucilla
there
is
no
end
to
the
enchantment
it
is
all
fairy
land
on
casting
our
eyes
as
she
directed
we
were
agreeably
surprised
with
observing
a
large
kind
of
temporary
shed
or
booth
at
some
distance
from
us
it
was
picturesquely
fixed
near
an
old
spreading
oak
and
was
ingeniously
composed
of
branches
of
trees
fresh
and
green
under
the
oak
stood
ranged
the
village
maids
we
walked
to
the
spot
the
inside
of
the
booth
was
hung
round
with
caps
aprons
bonnets
handkerchiefs
and
other
coarse
but
neat
articles
of
female
dress
on
a
rustic
table
was
laid
a
number
of
bibles
and
specimens
of
several
kinds
of
coarse
works
and
little
manufactures
the
various
performances
were
examined
by
the
company
some
presents
were
given
to
all
but
additional
prizes
were
awarded
by
the
young
patronesses
to
the
best
specimens
of
different
work
to
the
best
knitters
the
best
manufacturers
of
split
straw
and
the
best
performers
in
plain
work
i
think
they
called
it
three
grown
up
young
women
neatly
dressed
and
of
modest
manners
stood
behind
it
appeared
that
one
of
them
had
taken
such
good
care
of
her
young
sisters
and
brothers
since
their
mother
death
and
had
so
prudently
managed
her
father
house
that
it
had
saved
him
from
an
imprudent
choice
another
had
postponed
for
many
months
a
marriage
in
which
her
heart
was
engaged
because
she
had
a
paralytic
grandmother
whom
she
attended
day
and
night
and
whom
nothing
not
even
love
itself
could
tempt
her
to
desert
death
having
now
released
the
aged
sufferer
the
wedding
was
to
take
place
next
sunday
the
third
had
for
above
a
year
worked
two
hours
every
day
over
and
above
her
set
time
and
applied
the
gains
to
clothe
the
orphan
child
of
a
deceased
friend
she
was
also
to
accompany
her
lover
to
the
altar
on
sunday
but
had
made
it
a
condition
of
her
marrying
him
that
she
should
be
allowed
to
continue
her
supernumerary
hours
work
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
orphan
all
three
had
been
exemplary
in
their
attendance
at
church
as
well
as
in
their
general
conduct
the
fair
patronesses
presented
each
with
a
handsome
bible
and
with
a
complete
plain
but
very
neat
suit
of
apparel
while
these
gifts
were
distributing
i
whispered
sir
john
that
one
such
ticket
as
we
were
each
desired
to
take
for
squallini
benefit
would
furnish
the
cottages
of
these
poor
girls
and
it
replied
he
with
emphasis
how
little
a
way
will
that
sum
go
in
superfluities
which
will
make
two
honest
couple
happy
how
costly
is
vanity
how
cheap
is
charity
can
these
happy
useful
young
creatures
be
my
little
inactive
insipid
astons
charles
whispered
stanley
as
we
walked
away
to
leave
the
girls
to
sit
down
to
their
plentiful
supper
which
was
spread
on
a
long
table
under
the
oak
without
the
green
booth
this
group
of
figures
made
an
interesting
addition
to
the
scenery
when
we
got
back
to
the
temple
and
often
attracted
our
attention
while
we
were
engaged
in
conversation
chapter
xxxiv
the
company
were
not
soon
weary
of
admiring
the
rustic
building
which
seemed
raised
as
if
by
the
stroke
of
a
magician
wand
so
rapidly
had
it
sprung
up
they
were
delighted
to
find
that
their
pleasure
was
to
be
prolonged
by
drinking
tea
in
the
temple
while
we
were
at
tea
stanley
addressing
himself
to
me
said
i
have
always
forgotten
to
ask
you
charles
if
your
high
expectations
of
pleasure
from
the
society
in
london
had
quite
answered
i
was
entertained
and
i
was
disappointed
replied
i
i
always
found
the
pleasure
of
the
moment
not
heightened
but
effaced
by
the
succeeding
moment
the
ever
restless
rolling
tide
of
new
intelligence
at
once
gratified
and
excited
the
passion
for
novelty
which
i
found
to
be
grand
poisson
qui
mange
les
this
successive
abundance
of
fresh
supply
gives
an
ephemeral
importance
to
every
thing
and
a
lasting
importance
to
nothing
we
skimmed
every
topic
but
dived
into
none
much
desultory
talk
but
little
discussion
the
combatants
skirmished
like
men
whose
arms
are
kept
bright
by
constant
use
who
were
accustomed
to
a
flying
fight
but
who
avoided
the
fatigue
of
coming
to
close
quarters
what
was
old
however
momentous
was
rejected
as
dull
what
was
new
however
insignificant
was
thought
interesting
events
of
the
past
week
were
placed
with
those
beyond
the
flood
and
the
very
existence
of
occurrences
which
continued
to
be
matter
of
deep
interest
with
us
in
the
country
seemed
there
totally
forgotten
i
found
too
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
metropolis
had
a
standard
of
merit
of
their
own
that
knowledge
of
the
town
was
concluded
to
be
knowledge
of
the
world
that
local
habits
reigning
phrases
temporary
fashions
and
an
acquaintance
with
the
surface
of
manners
was
supposed
to
be
knowledge
of
mankind
of
course
he
who
was
ignorant
of
the
topics
of
the
hour
and
the
anecdotes
of
a
few
modish
leaders
was
ignorant
of
human
nature
sir
john
observed
that
i
was
rather
too
young
to
be
a
of
past
yet
he
allowed
that
the
standard
of
conversation
was
not
so
high
as
it
had
been
in
the
time
of
my
father
by
whose
reports
my
youthful
ardor
had
been
inflamed
he
did
not
indeed
suppose
that
men
were
less
intellectual
now
but
they
certainly
were
less
colloquially
intellectual
for
this
added
he
various
reasons
may
be
assigned
in
london
man
is
every
day
becoming
less
of
a
social
and
more
of
a
gregarious
animal
crowds
are
as
little
favorable
to
conversation
as
to
reflection
he
finds
therefore
that
he
may
figure
in
the
mass
with
less
expense
of
mind
and
as
to
women
they
are
put
to
no
expense
at
all
they
find
that
by
mixing
with
myriads
they
may
carry
on
the
daily
intercourse
of
life
without
being
obliged
to
bring
a
single
idea
to
enrich
the
common
stock
i
do
not
wonder
said
i
that
the
dull
and
the
uninformed
love
to
shelter
their
insignificance
in
a
crowd
in
mingling
with
the
multitude
their
deficiencies
elude
detection
the
vapid
and
the
ignorant
are
like
a
bad
play
they
owe
the
little
figure
they
make
to
the
dress
the
scenery
the
music
and
the
company
the
noise
and
the
glare
take
off
all
attention
from
the
defects
of
the
work
the
spectator
is
amused
and
he
does
not
inquire
whether
it
is
with
the
piece
or
with
the
accompaniments
the
end
is
attained
and
he
is
little
solicitous
about
the
means
but
an
intellectual
woman
like
a
well
written
drama
will
please
at
home
without
all
these
aids
and
adjuncts
nay
the
beauties
of
the
superior
piece
and
of
the
superior
woman
will
rise
on
a
more
intimate
survey
but
you
were
going
sir
john
to
assign
other
causes
for
the
decline
and
fall
of
conversation
one
very
affecting
reason
replied
he
is
that
the
alarming
state
of
public
affairs
fills
all
men
minds
with
one
momentous
object
as
every
englishman
is
a
patriot
every
patriot
is
a
politician
it
is
natural
that
that
subject
should
fill
every
mouth
which
occupies
every
heart
and
that
little
room
should
be
left
for
extraneous
matter
i
should
accept
this
said
i
as
a
satisfactory
vindication
had
i
heard
that
the
same
absorbing
cause
had
thinned
the
public
places
or
diminished
the
attraction
of
the
private
resorts
of
dissipation
there
is
a
third
reason
said
sir
john
polite
literature
has
in
a
good
degree
given
way
to
experimental
philosophy
the
admirers
of
science
assert
that
the
last
was
the
age
of
words
and
that
this
is
the
age
of
things
a
more
substantial
kind
of
knowledge
has
partly
superseded
these
elegant
studies
which
have
caught
such
hold
on
your
affections
i
heartily
wish
replied
i
that
the
new
pursuits
may
be
found
to
make
men
wiser
they
certainly
have
not
made
them
more
agreeable
it
is
affirmed
said
stanley
that
the
prevailing
philosophical
studies
have
a
religious
use
and
that
they
naturally
tend
to
elevate
the
heart
to
the
great
author
of
the
universe
i
have
but
one
objection
to
that
assertion
replied
sir
john
namely
that
it
is
not
true
this
would
seem
indeed
to
be
their
direct
tendency
yet
experiment
which
you
know
is
the
soul
of
philosophy
has
proved
the
contrary
he
then
adduced
some
instances
in
our
own
country
which
i
forbear
to
name
that
clearly
evinced
that
this
was
not
their
necessary
consequence
adding
however
a
few
great
names
on
the
more
honorable
side
he
next
adverted
to
the
baillies
the
condorcets
the
and
the
lalandes
as
melancholy
proofs
of
the
inefficacy
of
mere
science
to
make
christians
far
be
it
from
me
said
sir
john
to
undervalue
philosophical
pursuits
the
modern
discoveries
are
extremely
important
especially
in
their
application
to
the
purposes
of
common
life
but
where
these
are
pursued
exclusively
i
can
not
help
preferring
the
study
of
the
great
classic
authors
those
exquisite
masters
of
life
and
manners
with
whose
spirit
conversation
twenty
or
thirty
years
ago
was
so
richly
impregnated
i
confess
said
i
there
may
be
more
matter
but
there
is
certainly
less
mind
in
the
reigning
pursuits
the
reputation
of
skill
it
is
true
may
be
obtained
at
a
much
less
expense
of
time
and
intellect
the
comparative
cheapness
of
the
acquisition
holds
out
the
powerful
temptation
of
more
credit
with
less
labor
a
sufficient
knowledge
of
botany
or
chemistry
to
make
a
figure
is
easily
obtained
while
a
thorough
acquaintance
with
the
historians
poets
and
orators
of
antiquity
requires
much
time
and
close
application
but
exclaimed
sir
john
can
the
fashionable
studies
pretend
to
give
the
same
expansion
to
the
mind
the
same
elevation
to
the
sentiments
the
same
energy
to
the
feelings
the
same
stretch
and
compass
to
the
understanding
the
same
correctness
to
the
taste
the
same
grace
and
spirit
to
the
whole
moral
and
intellectual
man
for
my
own
part
replied
i
so
far
from
saying
with
hamlet
delights
not
me
nor
woman
neither
i
confess
i
have
little
delight
in
any
thing
else
as
a
man
man
is
the
creature
with
whom
i
have
to
do
and
the
varieties
in
his
character
interest
me
more
than
all
the
possible
varieties
of
mosses
shells
and
fossils
to
view
this
compound
creature
in
the
complexity
of
his
actions
as
portrayed
by
the
hand
of
those
immortal
masters
tacitus
and
plutarch
to
view
him
in
the
struggle
of
his
passions
as
displayed
by
euripides
and
shakspeare
to
contemplate
him
in
the
blaze
of
his
eloquence
by
the
two
rival
orators
of
greece
and
rome
is
more
congenial
to
my
feelings
than
the
ablest
disquisition
of
which
matter
was
ever
the
subject
sir
john
who
is
a
passionate
and
rather
too
exclusive
admirer
of
classic
lore
warmly
declared
himself
of
my
opinion
i
went
to
town
replied
i
with
a
mind
eager
for
intellectual
pleasure
my
memory
was
not
quite
unfurnished
with
passages
which
i
thought
likely
to
be
adverted
to
and
which
might
serve
to
embellish
conversation
without
incurring
the
charge
of
pedantry
but
though
most
of
the
men
i
conversed
with
were
my
equals
in
education
and
my
superiors
in
talent
there
seemed
little
disposition
to
promote
such
topics
as
might
bring
our
understandings
into
play
whether
it
is
that
business
active
life
and
public
debate
absorb
the
mind
and
make
men
consider
society
rather
as
a
scene
to
rest
than
to
exercise
it
i
know
not
certain
it
is
that
they
brought
less
into
the
treasury
of
conversation
than
i
expected
not
because
they
were
poor
but
proud
or
idle
and
reserved
their
talents
and
acquisitions
for
higher
occasions
the
most
opulent
possessors
i
often
found
the
most
penurious
contributors
de
said
stanley
was
the
favorite
maxim
of
an
author
whom
i
am
not
apt
to
quote
for
rules
of
moral
conduct
yet
its
adoption
would
be
a
salutary
check
against
excess
in
all
our
pursuits
if
polite
learning
is
undervalued
by
the
mere
man
of
science
it
is
perhaps
by
the
mere
man
of
letters
if
it
dignifies
retirement
and
exalts
society
it
is
not
the
great
business
of
life
it
is
not
the
prime
fountain
of
moral
excellence
footnote
frederic
the
great
king
of
prussia
well
so
much
for
said
sir
john
but
charles
you
have
not
told
us
what
you
had
to
say
of
in
your
observations
on
society
as
to
woman
replied
i
i
declare
that
i
found
more
propensity
to
promote
subjects
of
taste
and
elegant
speculation
among
some
of
the
superior
class
of
females
than
in
many
of
my
own
sex
the
more
prudent
however
are
restrained
through
fear
of
the
illiberal
sarcasms
of
men
who
not
contented
to
suppress
their
own
faculties
ridicule
all
intellectual
exertion
in
woman
though
evidently
arising
from
a
modest
desire
of
improvement
and
not
the
vanity
of
hopeless
rivalry
charles
is
always
the
paladin
of
the
reading
ladies
said
sir
john
i
do
not
deny
it
replied
i
if
they
bear
their
faculties
meekly
but
i
confess
that
what
is
sneeringly
called
a
learned
lady
is
to
me
far
preferable
to
a
scientific
one
such
as
i
encountered
one
evening
who
talked
of
the
fulcrum
and
the
lever
and
the
statera
which
she
took
care
to
tell
us
was
the
roman
with
all
the
of
philosophical
conceit
scientific
men
said
sir
john
are
in
general
admirable
for
their
simplicity
but
in
a
technical
woman
i
have
seldom
found
a
grain
of
taste
or
elegance
i
own
replied
i
i
should
greatly
prefer
a
fair
companion
who
could
modestly
discriminate
between
the
beauties
of
virgil
and
milton
to
one
who
was
always
dabbling
in
chemistry
and
who
came
to
dinner
with
dirty
hands
from
the
laboratory
and
yet
i
admire
chemistry
too
i
am
now
only
speaking
of
that
knowledge
which
is
desirable
in
a
female
companion
for
knowledge
i
must
have
but
arts
which
are
of
immense
value
in
manufactures
wo
make
my
wife
conversation
entertaining
to
me
discoveries
which
may
greatly
improve
dyeing
and
bleaching
will
add
little
to
the
delights
of
one
summer
evening
walk
or
winter
the
ladies
lucilla
especially
smiled
at
my
warmth
i
felt
that
there
was
approbation
in
her
smile
and
though
i
thought
i
had
said
too
much
already
it
encouraged
me
to
go
on
i
repeat
that
next
to
religion
whatever
relates
to
human
manners
is
most
attracting
to
human
creatures
to
turn
from
conversation
to
composition
what
is
it
that
excites
so
feeble
an
interest
in
perusing
that
finely
written
poem
of
the
abbe
de
lille
jardins
it
is
because
his
garden
has
no
cultivators
no
inhabitants
no
men
and
women
what
confers
that
powerful
charm
on
the
descriptive
parts
of
paradise
lost
a
fascination
i
will
venture
to
affirm
paramount
to
all
the
lovely
and
magnificent
scenery
which
adorns
it
eden
itself
with
all
its
exquisite
landscape
would
excite
a
very
inferior
pleasure
did
it
exhibit
only
inanimate
beauties
is
the
proprietors
is
the
inhabitants
is
the
of
eden
which
seize
upon
the
affections
and
twine
about
the
heart
the
gardens
even
of
paradise
would
be
dull
without
the
gardeners
is
mental
excellence
is
moral
beauty
which
completes
the
charm
where
this
is
wanting
landscape
poetry
though
it
be
read
with
pleasure
yet
the
interest
it
raises
is
cold
it
is
admired
but
seldom
quoted
it
leaves
no
definite
idea
on
the
mind
if
general
it
is
indistinct
if
minute
tedious
it
must
be
confessed
said
sir
john
that
some
poets
are
apt
to
forget
that
the
finest
representation
of
nature
is
only
the
scene
not
the
object
the
canvas
not
the
portrait
we
had
indeed
some
time
ago
so
much
of
this
gorgeous
so
much
splendid
poetical
botany
so
many
amorous
flowers
and
so
many
vegetable
courtships
so
many
wedded
plants
roots
transformed
to
nymphs
and
dwelling
in
emerald
palaces
that
some
how
or
other
truth
and
probability
and
nature
and
man
slipped
out
of
the
picture
though
it
must
be
allowed
that
genius
held
the
pencil
in
mason
garden
replied
i
alcander
precepts
would
have
been
cold
had
there
been
no
personification
the
introduction
of
character
dramatizes
what
else
would
have
been
frigidly
didactic
thomson
enriches
his
landscape
with
here
and
there
a
figure
drawn
with
more
correctness
than
warmth
with
more
nature
than
spirit
and
exalts
it
everywhere
by
moral
allusion
and
religious
reference
the
scenery
of
cowper
is
perpetually
animated
with
sketches
of
character
enlivened
with
portraits
from
real
life
and
the
exhibition
of
human
manners
and
passions
his
most
exquisite
descriptions
owe
their
vividness
to
moral
illustration
loyalty
liberty
patriotism
charity
piety
benevolence
every
generous
feeling
every
glowing
sentiment
every
ennobling
passion
grows
out
of
his
descriptive
powers
his
matter
always
bursts
into
mind
his
shrubbery
his
forest
his
all
produce
fruits
worthy
of
paradise
and
lead
to
immortality
stanley
said
adverting
again
to
the
subject
of
conversation
it
was
an
amusement
to
him
to
observe
what
impression
the
first
introduction
to
general
society
made
on
a
mind
conversant
with
books
but
to
whom
a
the
world
was
in
a
manner
new
i
believe
said
sir
john
that
an
overflowing
commerce
and
the
excessive
opulence
it
has
introduced
though
favorable
to
all
the
splendors
of
art
and
mechanic
ingenuity
yet
have
lowered
the
standard
of
taste
and
debilitated
the
mental
energies
they
are
advantageous
to
luxury
but
fatal
to
intellect
it
has
added
to
the
brilliancy
of
the
itself
but
deducted
from
that
of
the
inhabitant
it
has
given
perfection
to
our
mirrors
our
candelabras
our
gilding
our
inlaying
and
our
sculpture
but
it
has
communicated
a
torpor
to
the
imagination
and
enervated
our
intellectual
vigor
in
one
way
said
stanley
smiling
luxury
has
been
favorable
to
literature
from
the
unparalleled
splendor
of
our
printing
paper
engraving
illuminating
and
binding
luxury
has
caused
more
books
to
be
purchased
while
from
the
growth
of
dissipation
it
causes
fewer
to
be
read
i
believe
we
were
much
more
familiar
with
our
native
poets
in
their
former
plain
garb
than
since
they
have
been
attired
in
the
gorgeous
dress
which
now
decorates
our
shelves
poetry
replied
stanley
has
of
late
too
much
degenerated
into
personal
satire
persiflage
and
caricature
among
one
class
of
writers
while
among
another
it
has
exhibited
the
vagrancies
of
genius
without
the
inspiration
the
exuberance
of
fancy
without
the
curb
of
judgment
and
the
eccentricities
of
invention
without
the
restrictions
of
taste
the
image
has
been
strained
while
the
verse
has
been
slackened
we
have
had
pleonasm
without
fullness
and
facility
without
force
redundancy
has
been
mistaken
for
plenitude
flimsiness
for
ease
and
distortion
for
energy
an
over
desire
of
being
natural
has
made
the
poet
feeble
and
the
rage
for
being
simple
has
sometimes
made
him
silly
the
sensibility
is
sickly
and
the
elevation
vertiginous
to
cowper
said
sir
john
master
of
melody
as
he
is
the
mischief
is
partly
attributable
such
an
original
must
naturally
have
a
herd
of
imitators
if
they
can
not
attain
to
his
excellences
his
faults
are
always
attainable
the
resemblance
between
the
master
and
the
scholar
is
found
chiefly
in
his
defects
the
determined
imitator
of
an
easy
writer
becomes
insipid
of
a
sublime
one
absurd
cowper
ease
appeared
his
most
imitable
charm
but
ease
aggraved
is
insipidity
his
occasional
negligences
his
disciples
adopted
uniformly
in
cowper
there
might
sometimes
be
carelessness
in
the
verse
but
the
verse
itself
was
sustained
by
the
vigor
of
the
sentiment
the
imitator
forgot
that
his
strength
lay
in
the
thought
that
his
buoyant
spirit
always
supported
itself
that
the
figure
though
amplified
was
never
distorted
the
image
though
bold
was
never
incongruous
and
the
illustration
though
new
was
never
false
the
evil
however
continued
sir
john
seems
to
be
correcting
itself
the
real
genius
which
exists
in
several
of
this
whimsical
school
i
trust
will
at
length
lead
them
to
prune
their
excrescences
and
reform
their
youthful
eccentricities
their
good
sense
will
teach
that
the
surest
road
to
fame
is
to
condescend
to
tread
in
the
luminous
track
of
their
great
precursors
in
the
art
they
will
see
that
deviation
is
not
always
improvement
that
whoever
wants
to
be
better
than
nature
will
infallibly
be
worse
that
truth
in
taste
is
as
obvious
as
in
morals
and
as
certain
as
in
mathematics
in
other
quarters
both
the
classic
and
the
gothic
muse
are
emulously
soaring
and
i
hail
the
restoration
of
genuine
poetry
and
pure
taste
i
must
not
said
i
loquacious
as
i
have
already
been
dismiss
the
subject
of
conversation
without
remarking
that
i
found
there
was
one
topic
which
seemed
as
uniformly
avoided
by
common
consent
as
if
it
had
been
banished
by
the
interdict
of
absolute
authority
and
that
some
forfeiture
or
at
least
dishonor
and
disgrace
were
to
follow
it
on
conviction
i
mean
religion
surely
charles
said
sir
john
you
would
not
convert
general
conversation
into
a
divinity
school
and
friendly
societies
into
debating
clubs
far
from
it
replied
i
nor
do
i
desire
that
ladies
and
gentlemen
over
their
tea
and
coffee
should
rehearse
their
articles
of
faith
or
fill
the
intervals
of
carving
and
eating
with
introducing
dogmas
or
discussing
controversies
i
do
not
wish
to
erect
the
social
table
which
was
meant
for
innocent
relaxation
into
an
arena
for
theological
combatants
i
only
wish
as
people
live
so
much
together
that
if
when
out
of
the
multitude
of
topics
which
arise
in
conversation
an
unlucky
wight
happens
to
start
a
serious
thought
i
could
see
a
cordial
recognition
of
its
importance
i
wish
i
could
see
a
disposition
to
pursue
it
instead
of
a
chilling
silence
which
obliges
him
to
draw
in
as
if
he
had
dropped
something
dangerous
to
the
state
or
inimical
to
the
general
cheerfulness
or
derogatory
to
his
own
understanding
i
only
desire
that
as
without
any
effort
on
the
part
of
the
speaker
but
merely
from
the
overflowing
fullness
of
a
mind
habitually
occupied
with
one
leading
concern
we
easily
perceive
that
one
of
the
company
is
a
lawyer
another
a
soldier
a
third
a
physician
i
only
wish
that
we
could
oftener
discover
from
the
same
plenitude
so
hard
to
conceal
where
it
exists
that
we
were
in
a
company
of
christians
we
must
not
expect
in
our
day
said
stanley
to
see
revive
that
animating
picture
of
the
prevalence
of
religious
intercourse
given
by
the
prophet
they
that
feared
the
lord
spake
often
one
to
another
and
yet
one
can
not
but
regret
that
in
select
society
men
well
informed
as
we
know
well
principled
as
we
hope
having
one
common
portion
of
being
to
fill
having
one
common
faith
one
common
father
one
common
journey
to
perform
one
common
termination
to
that
journey
and
one
common
object
in
view
beyond
it
should
when
together
be
so
unwilling
to
advert
occasionally
to
those
great
points
which
doubtless
often
occupy
them
in
secret
that
they
should
on
the
contrary
adopt
a
sort
of
inverted
hypocrisy
and
wish
to
appear
worse
than
they
really
are
that
they
should
be
so
backward
to
give
or
to
gain
information
to
lend
or
to
borrow
lights
in
a
matter
in
which
they
are
all
equally
interested
which
can
not
be
the
case
in
any
other
possible
subject
in
all
human
concerns
said
i
we
find
that
those
dispositions
tastes
and
affections
which
are
brought
into
exercise
flourish
while
others
are
smothered
by
concealment
it
is
certain
replied
stanley
that
knowledge
which
is
never
brought
forward
is
apt
to
decline
some
feelings
require
to
be
excited
in
order
to
know
if
they
exist
in
short
topics
of
every
kind
which
are
kept
totally
out
of
sight
make
a
fainter
impression
on
the
mind
than
such
as
are
occasionally
introduced
communication
is
a
great
strengthener
of
any
principle
feelings
as
well
as
ideas
are
often
elicited
by
collision
thoughts
that
are
never
to
be
produced
in
time
seldom
present
themselves
while
mutual
interchange
almost
creates
as
well
as
cultivates
them
and
as
to
the
social
affections
i
am
persuaded
that
men
would
love
each
other
more
cordially
and
kindness
would
be
inconceivably
promoted
were
they
in
the
habit
of
maintaining
that
sort
of
intercourse
which
would
keep
up
a
mutual
regard
for
their
eternal
interests
and
lead
them
more
to
consider
each
other
as
candidates
for
the
same
immortality
through
the
same
common
hope
just
as
he
had
ceased
to
speak
we
heard
a
warbling
of
female
voices
which
came
softened
to
us
by
distance
and
the
undulation
of
the
air
the
little
band
under
the
oak
had
finished
their
cheerful
repast
and
arranged
themselves
in
the
same
regular
procession
in
which
they
had
arrived
they
stood
still
at
a
respectful
distance
from
the
temple
and
in
their
artless
manner
sung
addison
beautiful
version
of
the
psalm
which
the
miss
astons
had
taught
them
because
it
was
a
favorite
with
their
mother
here
the
setting
sun
reminded
us
to
retreat
to
the
house
before
we
quitted
the
temple
however
sir
george
aston
ventured
modestly
to
intimate
a
wish
that
if
it
pleased
the
almighty
to
spare
our
lives
the
same
party
should
engage
always
to
celebrate
this
anniversary
in
the
temple
of
friendship
which
should
be
finished
on
a
larger
scale
and
rendered
less
unworthy
to
receive
such
guests
the
ladies
smiled
assentingly
ph
oe
be
applauded
rapturously
sir
john
belfield
and
i
warmly
approved
the
proposal
stanley
said
it
could
not
but
meet
with
his
cordial
concurrence
as
it
would
involve
the
assurance
of
an
annual
visit
from
his
valued
friends
as
we
walked
into
the
house
lady
aston
who
held
by
my
arm
in
answer
to
the
satisfaction
i
expressed
at
the
day
i
had
passed
said
we
owe
what
little
we
are
and
do
under
providence
to
stanley
you
will
admire
his
discriminating
mind
when
i
tell
you
that
he
recommends
these
little
exhibitions
for
my
daughters
far
more
than
to
his
own
he
says
that
they
being
naturally
cheerful
and
habitually
active
require
not
the
incentive
of
company
to
encourage
them
but
that
for
my
poor
timid
inactive
girls
the
support
and
animating
presence
of
a
few
chosen
friends
just
give
them
that
degree
of
life
and
spirit
which
serves
to
warm
their
hearts
and
keep
their
minds
in
motion
chapter
xxxv
miss
sparkes
came
to
spend
the
next
day
according
to
her
appointment
flam
who
called
accidentally
staid
to
dinner
and
carlton
had
been
previously
invited
after
dinner
the
conversation
chanced
to
turn
upon
domestic
economy
a
quality
which
miss
sparkes
professed
to
hold
in
the
most
sovereign
contempt
after
some
remark
of
stanley
in
favor
of
the
household
virtues
carlton
said
addison
in
the
spectator
and
johnson
in
the
rambler
have
each
given
us
a
lively
picture
of
a
vulgar
illiterate
housewife
the
notable
woman
of
the
one
suffocated
her
guests
at
night
with
drying
herbs
in
their
chamber
and
tormented
them
all
day
with
plans
of
economy
and
lectures
on
management
the
economist
of
the
other
ruined
her
husband
by
her
parsimonious
extravagance
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
couple
contradictions
by
her
hangings
for
which
she
had
no
walls
and
her
embroidery
for
which
she
had
no
use
the
poor
man
pathetically
laments
her
detestable
catalogues
of
made
wines
which
hurt
his
fortune
by
their
profusion
and
his
health
by
not
being
allowed
to
drink
them
till
they
were
sour
both
ladies
are
painted
as
domestic
tyrants
whose
husbands
had
no
peace
and
whose
children
had
no
education
those
coarse
housewives
said
sir
john
were
exhibited
as
it
was
reserved
for
the
pen
of
richardson
to
exhibit
this
author
with
deeper
and
juster
views
of
human
nature
a
truer
taste
for
the
proprieties
of
female
character
and
a
more
exact
intuition
into
real
life
than
any
other
writer
of
fabulous
narrative
has
given
in
his
heroines
exemplifications
of
elegantly
cultivated
minds
combined
with
the
sober
virtues
of
domestic
economy
in
no
other
writer
of
fictitious
adventures
has
the
triumph
of
religion
and
reason
over
the
passions
and
the
now
almost
exploded
doctrines
of
filial
obedience
and
the
household
virtues
their
natural
concomitants
been
so
successfully
blended
whether
the
works
of
this
most
original
but
by
no
means
faultless
writer
were
cause
or
effect
i
know
not
whether
these
examples
induced
the
ladies
of
that
day
study
household
good
or
whether
the
then
existing
ladies
by
their
acknowledged
attention
to
feminine
concerns
furnished
richardson
with
living
models
i
can
not
determine
certain
it
is
that
the
of
the
subsequent
period
have
in
general
been
as
little
disposed
to
represent
these
qualities
as
forming
an
indispensable
part
of
the
female
character
as
the
contemporary
young
ladies
themselves
have
been
to
supply
them
with
patterns
i
a
little
fear
that
the
predominance
of
this
sort
of
reading
has
contributed
its
full
share
to
bring
such
qualities
into
contempt
miss
sparkes
characteristically
observed
that
the
meanest
understanding
and
most
vulgar
education
were
competent
to
form
such
a
wife
as
the
generality
of
men
preferred
that
a
man
of
talents
dreading
a
rival
always
took
care
to
secure
himself
by
marrying
a
fool
always
excepting
the
present
company
madam
i
presume
said
stanley
laughing
but
pardon
me
if
i
differ
from
you
that
many
men
are
sensual
in
their
appetites
and
low
in
their
relish
of
intellectual
pleasures
i
confess
that
many
others
who
are
neither
sensual
nor
of
mean
attainments
prefer
women
whose
ignorance
will
favor
their
indolent
habits
and
whom
it
requires
no
exertion
of
mind
to
entertain
i
allow
also
but
permit
me
to
say
that
men
of
the
most
cultivated
minds
and
who
admire
talents
in
a
woman
are
still
of
opinion
that
talents
can
never
be
dispensed
with
and
i
totally
dissent
from
you
in
thinking
that
these
qualities
infer
the
absence
of
higher
attainments
and
necessarily
imply
a
sordid
or
a
vulgar
mind
any
ordinary
art
after
it
is
once
discovered
may
be
practiced
by
a
very
common
understanding
in
this
as
in
every
thing
else
the
kind
arrangements
of
providence
are
visible
because
as
the
common
arts
employ
the
mass
of
mankind
they
could
not
be
universally
carried
on
if
they
were
not
of
easy
and
cheap
attainment
now
cookery
is
one
of
these
arts
and
i
agree
with
you
madam
in
thinking
that
a
mean
understanding
and
a
vulgar
education
suffice
to
make
a
good
cook
but
a
cook
or
housekeeper
and
a
lady
qualified
to
wield
a
considerable
establishment
are
two
very
different
characters
to
prepare
a
dinner
and
to
conduct
a
great
family
require
talents
of
a
very
different
size
and
one
reason
why
i
would
never
choose
to
marry
a
woman
ignorant
of
domestic
affairs
is
that
she
who
wants
or
she
who
despises
this
knowledge
must
possess
that
previous
bad
judgment
which
as
it
prevented
her
from
seeing
this
part
of
her
duty
would
be
likely
to
operate
on
other
occasions
i
entirely
agree
with
stanley
said
carlton
in
general
i
look
upon
the
contempt
or
the
fulfillment
of
these
duties
as
pretty
certain
indications
of
the
turn
of
mind
from
which
the
one
or
the
other
proceeds
i
allow
however
that
this
knowledge
a
lady
may
unhappily
have
overlooked
more
important
acquisitions
but
it
i
must
ever
consider
the
female
character
as
defective
in
the
texture
however
it
may
be
embroidered
and
spangled
on
the
surface
sir
john
belfield
declared
that
though
he
had
not
that
natural
antipathy
to
a
wit
which
some
men
have
yet
unless
the
wildness
of
a
wit
was
tamed
like
the
wildness
of
other
animals
by
domestic
habits
he
himself
would
not
choose
to
venture
on
one
he
added
that
he
should
pay
a
bad
compliment
to
lady
belfield
who
had
so
much
higher
claims
to
his
esteem
if
he
were
to
allege
that
these
habits
were
the
determining
cause
of
his
choice
yet
had
he
seen
no
such
tendencies
in
her
character
he
should
have
suspected
her
power
of
making
him
as
happy
as
she
had
done
i
confess
with
shame
said
carlton
that
one
of
the
first
things
that
touched
me
with
any
sense
of
my
wife
merit
was
the
admirable
good
sense
she
discovered
in
the
direction
of
my
family
even
at
the
time
that
i
had
most
reason
to
blush
at
my
own
conduct
she
never
gave
me
cause
to
blush
for
hers
the
praises
constantly
bestowed
on
her
elegant
yet
prudent
arrangement
by
my
friends
flattered
my
vanity
and
raised
her
in
my
opinion
though
they
did
not
lead
me
to
do
her
full
justice
the
two
ladies
who
were
thus
agreeably
flattered
looked
modestly
grateful
stanley
said
i
was
going
to
endeavor
at
removing
miss
sparke
prejudices
by
observing
how
much
this
domestic
turn
brings
the
understanding
into
action
the
operation
of
good
sense
is
requisite
in
making
the
necessary
calculations
for
a
great
family
in
a
hundred
ways
good
sense
is
required
to
teach
that
a
perpetually
recurring
small
expense
is
more
to
be
avoided
than
an
incidental
great
one
while
it
shows
that
petty
savings
can
not
retrieve
an
injured
estate
the
story
told
by
johnson
of
a
lady
who
while
ruining
her
fortune
by
excessive
splendor
and
expense
yet
refused
to
let
a
two
shilling
mango
be
cut
at
her
table
exemplifies
exactly
my
idea
shabby
curtailments
without
repairing
the
breach
which
prodigality
has
made
discredit
the
husband
and
bring
the
reproach
of
meanness
on
the
wife
retrenchments
to
be
efficient
must
be
applied
to
great
objects
the
true
economist
will
draw
in
by
contracting
the
outline
by
narrowing
the
bottom
by
cutting
off
with
an
unsparing
hand
costly
superfluities
which
affect
not
comfort
but
cherish
vanity
the
lazy
vermin
of
thine
hall
was
the
wise
counsel
of
the
prudent
venetian
to
his
thoughtless
said
sir
john
and
its
wisdom
consisted
in
its
striking
at
one
of
the
most
ruinous
and
prevailing
domestic
evils
an
overloaded
establishment
if
miss
sparkes
had
been
so
long
without
speaking
it
was
evident
by
her
manner
and
turn
of
countenance
that
contempt
had
kept
her
silent
and
that
she
thought
the
topic
under
discussion
as
unworthy
of
the
support
of
the
gentleman
as
of
her
own
opposition
a
discreet
woman
said
stanley
adjusts
her
expenses
to
her
revenues
every
thing
knows
its
time
and
every
person
his
place
she
will
live
within
her
income
be
it
large
or
small
if
large
she
will
not
be
luxurious
if
small
she
will
not
be
mean
proportion
and
propriety
are
among
the
best
secrets
of
domestic
wisdom
and
there
is
no
surer
test
both
of
integrity
and
judgment
than
a
expenditure
now
the
point
to
which
i
would
bring
all
this
verbiage
continued
he
is
this
will
a
lady
of
a
mean
understanding
or
a
vulgar
education
be
likely
to
practice
economy
on
this
large
scale
and
is
not
such
economy
a
field
in
which
a
woman
of
the
best
sense
may
honorably
exercise
her
powers
miss
sparkes
who
was
always
a
stanch
opposer
in
moral
as
well
as
in
political
debate
because
she
said
it
was
the
best
side
for
the
exertion
of
wit
and
talents
comforted
herself
that
though
she
felt
she
was
completely
in
the
minority
yet
she
always
thought
that
was
rather
a
proof
of
being
right
than
the
contrary
for
if
it
be
true
that
the
generality
are
either
weak
or
wicked
it
follows
that
the
inferior
number
is
most
likely
to
be
neither
women
said
carlton
in
their
course
of
action
describe
a
smaller
circle
than
men
but
the
perfection
of
a
circle
consists
not
in
its
dimensions
but
in
its
correctness
there
may
be
added
he
carefully
turning
away
his
eyes
from
miss
sparkes
here
and
there
a
soaring
female
who
looks
down
with
disdain
on
the
party
affairs
of
dim
speck
called
earth
who
despises
order
and
regularity
as
indications
of
a
groveling
spirit
but
a
sound
mind
judges
directly
contrary
the
larger
the
capacity
the
wider
is
the
sweep
of
duties
it
takes
in
a
sensible
woman
loves
to
imitate
that
order
which
is
stamped
on
the
whole
creation
of
god
all
the
operations
of
nature
are
uniform
even
in
their
changes
and
regular
in
their
infinite
variety
nay
the
great
author
of
nature
himself
disdains
not
to
be
called
the
god
of
order
i
agree
with
you
said
sir
john
a
philosophical
lady
may
malebranche
boyle
and
locke
she
may
boast
of
her
intellectual
superiority
she
may
talk
of
abstract
and
concrete
of
substantial
forms
and
essences
complex
ideas
and
mixed
modes
of
identity
and
relation
she
may
decorate
all
the
logic
of
one
sex
with
all
the
rhetoric
of
the
other
yet
if
her
affairs
are
if
her
house
is
disorderly
her
servants
irregular
her
children
neglected
and
her
table
she
will
indicate
the
want
of
the
most
valuable
faculty
of
the
human
mind
a
sound
judgment
it
must
however
be
confessed
replied
stanley
that
such
instances
are
so
rare
that
the
exceptions
barely
serve
to
establish
the
rule
i
have
known
twenty
women
mismanage
their
affairs
through
a
bad
education
through
ignorance
especially
of
arithmetic
that
grand
deficiency
in
the
education
of
women
through
a
multiplicity
of
vain
accomplishments
through
an
excess
of
dissipation
through
a
devotedness
to
personal
embellishments
through
an
absorption
of
the
whole
soul
in
music
for
one
who
has
made
her
husband
metaphysically
miserable
what
marks
the
distinction
said
carlton
between
the
judicious
and
the
vulgar
economist
is
this
the
woman
succeeds
tolerably
in
the
filling
up
but
never
in
the
outline
she
is
made
up
of
detail
but
destitute
of
plan
petty
duties
demand
her
whole
grasp
of
mind
and
after
all
the
thing
is
incomplete
there
is
so
much
bustle
and
evident
exertion
in
all
she
does
she
brings
into
company
a
mind
exhausted
with
her
little
efforts
overflowing
with
a
sense
of
her
own
merits
looking
up
to
her
own
performance
as
the
highest
possible
elevation
of
the
human
intellect
and
looking
down
on
the
attainments
of
more
highly
gifted
women
as
so
many
obstructions
to
their
usefulness
always
drawing
comparisons
to
her
own
advantage
with
the
cultivated
and
the
refined
and
concluding
that
because
she
possesses
not
their
elegance
they
must
necessarily
be
deficient
in
her
art
while
economists
of
a
higher
strain
i
draw
from
living
and
not
absent
instances
added
he
looking
benignantly
round
him
execute
their
well
ordered
plan
as
an
indispensable
duty
but
not
as
a
superlative
merit
they
have
too
much
sense
to
omit
it
but
they
have
too
much
taste
to
talk
of
it
it
is
their
business
not
their
boast
the
effect
is
produced
but
the
hand
which
accomplishes
it
is
not
seen
the
mechanism
is
set
at
work
but
it
is
behind
the
scenes
the
beauty
is
visible
the
labor
is
kept
out
of
sight
the
misfortune
is
said
stanley
that
people
are
apt
to
fancy
that
judgment
is
a
faculty
only
to
be
exercised
on
great
occasions
whereas
it
is
one
that
every
hour
is
calling
into
exercise
there
are
certain
habits
which
though
they
appear
inconsiderable
when
examined
individually
are
yet
of
no
small
importance
in
the
aggregate
exactness
punctuality
and
other
minor
virtues
contribute
more
than
many
are
aware
to
promote
and
to
facilitate
the
exercise
of
the
higher
qualities
i
would
not
erect
them
into
a
magnitude
beyond
their
real
size
as
persons
are
too
apt
to
do
who
are
punctual
and
are
deficient
in
the
higher
qualities
but
by
the
regular
establishment
of
these
habits
in
a
family
it
is
inconceivable
to
those
who
have
not
made
the
experiment
how
it
saves
how
it
amplifies
time
that
canvas
upon
which
all
the
virtues
must
be
wrought
it
is
incredible
how
an
orderly
division
of
the
day
gives
apparent
rapidity
to
the
wings
of
time
while
a
stated
devotion
of
the
hour
to
its
employment
really
lengthens
life
it
lengthens
it
by
the
traces
which
solid
occupation
leaves
behind
it
while
it
prevents
tediousness
by
affording
with
the
successive
change
the
charm
of
novelty
and
keeping
up
an
interest
which
would
flag
if
any
one
employment
were
too
long
pursued
now
all
these
arrangements
of
life
these
divisions
of
time
and
these
selections
and
appropriations
of
the
business
to
the
hour
come
within
the
department
of
the
lady
and
how
much
will
the
cares
of
a
man
of
sense
be
relieved
if
he
choose
a
wife
who
can
do
all
this
for
him
in
how
many
of
my
friends
houses
said
carlton
have
i
observed
the
contrary
habits
produce
contrary
effects
a
young
lady
bred
in
total
ignorance
of
family
management
transplanted
from
the
house
of
her
father
where
she
has
learned
nothing
to
that
of
her
husband
where
she
is
expected
to
know
every
thing
disappoints
a
prudent
man
his
affection
may
continue
but
his
esteem
will
be
diminished
and
with
his
happiness
his
attachment
to
home
will
be
proportionably
lessened
it
is
perfectly
just
said
sir
john
and
this
comfortless
deficiency
has
naturally
taught
men
to
inveigh
against
that
higher
kind
of
knowledge
which
they
suppose
though
unjustly
to
be
the
cause
of
ignorance
in
domestic
matters
it
is
not
entirely
to
gratify
the
animal
as
miss
sparkes
supposes
that
a
gentleman
likes
to
have
his
table
well
appointed
but
because
his
own
dignity
and
his
wife
credit
are
involved
in
it
the
want
of
this
skill
is
one
of
the
grand
evils
of
modern
life
the
heiress
of
the
man
of
rank
to
the
daughter
of
the
opulent
tradesman
there
is
no
one
quality
in
which
young
women
are
so
generally
deficient
as
in
domestic
and
when
i
hear
learning
contended
for
on
one
hand
and
modish
accomplishments
on
the
other
i
always
contend
for
this
intermediate
this
valuable
this
neglected
quality
so
little
insisted
on
so
rarely
found
and
so
indispensably
necessary
besides
said
carlton
addressing
himself
to
miss
sparkes
you
ladies
are
apt
to
consider
versatility
as
a
mark
of
genius
she
therefore
who
can
do
a
great
thing
well
ought
to
do
a
small
one
better
for
as
lord
bacon
well
observes
he
who
can
not
contract
his
mind
as
well
as
dilate
it
wants
one
great
talent
in
life
miss
sparkes
condescending
at
length
to
break
a
silence
which
she
had
maintained
with
evident
uneasiness
said
all
these
plodding
employments
cramp
the
genius
degrade
the
intellect
depress
the
spirits
debase
the
taste
and
clip
the
wings
of
imagination
and
this
poor
cramped
degraded
stinted
depressed
debased
creature
is
the
very
being
whom
men
men
of
reputed
sense
too
commonly
prefer
to
the
mind
of
large
dimensions
soaring
fancy
and
aspiring
tastes
imagination
replied
stanley
well
directed
is
the
charm
of
life
it
gilds
every
object
and
embellishes
every
scene
but
allow
me
to
say
that
where
a
woman
abandons
herself
to
the
dominion
of
this
vagrant
faculty
it
may
lead
to
something
worse
than
a
disorderly
table
and
the
husband
may
find
that
the
badness
of
his
dinner
is
not
the
only
ill
consequence
of
her
vagaries
true
enough
said
flam
who
had
never
been
known
to
be
so
silent
or
so
attentive
true
enough
i
have
not
heard
so
much
sense
for
a
long
time
i
am
sure
is
sense
because
is
exactly
my
own
way
of
thinking
there
is
my
bell
now
i
have
spent
seven
hundred
pounds
and
more
money
for
her
to
learn
music
and
whimwhams
which
all
put
together
are
not
worth
sixpence
i
would
give
them
all
up
to
see
her
make
such
a
tansy
pudding
as
that
which
the
widow
in
the
spectator
helped
sir
roger
to
at
dinner
why
i
do
believe
bell
knows
whether
is
made
with
butter
or
cheese
or
whether
a
venison
pastry
should
be
baked
or
boiled
i
can
tell
her
that
when
her
husband
if
she
ever
gets
one
comes
in
sharp
set
from
hunting
he
wo
like
to
be
put
off
with
a
tune
instead
of
a
dinner
to
marry
a
singing
girl
and
complain
she
does
not
keep
you
a
good
table
is
like
eating
nightingales
and
finding
fault
that
they
are
not
good
tasted
they
sing
but
they
are
of
no
further
use
to
them
instead
of
listening
to
them
is
applying
to
one
sense
the
gratification
which
belongs
to
another
in
the
course
of
conversation
miss
sparkes
a
little
shocked
the
delicate
feelings
of
the
ladies
of
lucilla
especially
by
throwing
out
some
expressions
of
envy
at
the
superior
advantages
which
men
possess
for
distinguishing
themselves
women
she
said
with
talents
not
inferior
were
allowed
no
stage
for
display
while
men
had
such
a
reach
for
their
exertions
such
a
compass
for
exercising
their
genius
such
a
range
for
obtaining
distinction
that
they
were
at
once
the
objects
of
her
envy
for
the
means
they
possessed
and
of
her
pity
for
turning
them
to
no
better
account
there
were
indeed
she
added
a
few
men
who
redeemed
the
credit
of
the
rest
and
for
their
sakes
she
gloried
since
she
could
not
be
of
their
sex
that
she
was
at
least
of
their
species
i
know
madam
said
stanley
your
admiration
of
heroic
qualities
and
manly
virtues
courage
for
instance
but
there
are
still
nobler
ways
of
exercising
courage
than
even
in
the
field
of
battle
there
are
more
exalted
means
of
showing
spirit
than
by
sending
or
accepting
a
challenge
to
sustain
a
fit
of
sickness
may
exhibit
as
true
heroism
as
to
lead
an
army
to
bear
a
deep
affliction
well
calls
for
as
high
exertion
of
soul
as
to
storm
a
town
and
to
meet
death
with
christian
resolution
is
an
act
of
courage
in
which
many
a
woman
has
triumphed
and
many
a
philosopher
and
even
some
generals
have
failed
i
thought
i
saw
in
miss
sparkes
countenance
a
kind
of
civil
contempt
as
if
she
would
be
glad
to
exchange
the
patient
sickness
and
heroic
for
the
renown
of
victory
and
the
glory
of
a
battle
and
i
suspected
that
she
envied
the
fame
of
the
challenge
and
the
spirit
of
the
duel
more
than
those
meek
and
passive
virtues
which
we
all
agreed
were
peculiarly
christian
and
peculiarly
feminine
chapter
xxxvi
in
the
afternoon
when
the
company
were
assembled
in
the
the
conversation
turned
on
various
subjects
flam
feeling
as
if
he
had
not
sufficiently
produced
himself
at
dinner
now
took
the
lead
he
was
never
solicitous
to
show
what
he
called
his
learning
but
when
miss
sparkes
was
present
whom
it
was
his
grand
delight
to
as
he
called
it
then
he
never
failed
to
give
broad
hints
that
if
he
was
now
no
great
student
it
was
not
from
ignorance
but
from
the
pressure
of
more
indispensable
avocations
he
first
rambled
into
some
desultory
remarks
on
the
absurdity
of
the
world
and
the
preposterousness
of
modern
usages
which
perverted
the
ends
of
education
and
exalted
things
which
were
of
least
use
into
most
importance
you
seem
out
of
humor
with
the
world
flam
said
stanley
i
hate
the
world
returned
he
it
is
indeed
replied
stanley
a
scene
of
much
danger
because
of
much
evil
i
do
value
the
danger
a
straw
rejoined
flam
and
as
to
the
evil
i
hope
i
have
sense
enough
to
avoid
that
but
i
hate
it
for
its
folly
and
despise
it
for
its
inconsistency
in
what
particulars
mr
flam
said
sir
john
belfield
in
every
thing
replied
he
in
the
first
place
do
people
educate
their
daughters
entirely
for
holidays
and
then
wonder
that
they
are
of
no
use
do
they
charge
them
to
be
modest
and
then
teach
them
every
thing
that
can
make
them
bold
are
we
not
angry
that
they
do
attend
to
great
concerns
after
having
instructed
them
to
take
the
most
pains
for
the
least
things
there
is
my
fan
now
they
tell
me
she
can
dance
as
well
as
a
posture
mistress
but
she
slouches
in
her
walk
like
a
milkmaid
now
as
she
seldom
dances
and
is
always
walking
would
it
not
be
more
rational
to
teach
her
to
do
that
best
which
she
is
to
do
the
oftenest
she
sings
like
a
siren
but
is
only
to
strangers
i
who
paid
for
it
never
hear
her
voice
she
is
always
warbling
in
a
distant
room
or
in
every
room
where
there
is
company
but
if
i
have
the
gout
and
want
to
be
amused
she
is
as
dumb
as
a
dormouse
so
much
for
the
errors
in
educating
our
daughters
said
sir
john
now
for
the
sons
as
to
our
boys
returned
flam
do
we
educate
them
in
one
religion
and
then
expect
them
to
practice
another
do
we
cram
them
with
books
of
heathen
philosophy
and
then
bid
them
go
and
be
good
christians
do
we
teach
them
to
admire
the
heroes
and
gods
of
the
old
poets
when
there
is
hardly
one
hero
and
certainly
not
one
god
who
would
not
in
this
country
have
been
tried
at
the
old
bailey
if
not
executed
at
tyburn
and
as
to
the
goddesses
if
they
had
been
brought
before
us
on
the
bench
brother
stanley
there
is
scarcely
one
of
them
but
we
should
have
ordered
to
the
house
of
correction
the
queen
of
them
indeed
i
should
have
sent
to
the
for
a
scold
then
again
do
we
tell
our
sons
when
men
that
they
must
admire
a
monarchical
government
after
every
pains
have
been
taken
when
they
were
boys
to
fill
them
with
raptures
for
the
ancient
republics
surely
flam
said
sir
john
the
ancient
forms
of
government
may
be
studied
with
advantage
were
it
only
to
show
us
by
contrast
the
superior
excellence
of
our
own
we
might
said
miss
sparkes
in
a
supercilious
accent
learn
some
things
from
them
which
we
much
want
you
have
been
speaking
of
economy
these
republicans
whom
flam
is
pleased
to
speak
of
with
so
much
contempt
he
must
allow
had
some
good
clever
contrivances
to
keep
down
the
taxes
which
it
would
do
us
no
harm
to
imitate
victories
were
much
better
bargains
to
them
than
they
are
to
us
a
few
laurel
leaves
or
a
sprig
of
oak
was
not
quite
so
dear
as
a
pension
but
you
will
allow
madam
said
sir
john
smiling
that
a
triumph
was
a
more
expensive
reward
than
a
title
before
she
had
time
to
answer
flam
said
let
me
tell
you
miss
sparkes
that
as
to
triumphs
our
heroes
are
so
used
to
them
at
sea
that
they
would
laugh
at
them
at
home
those
who
obtain
triumphs
as
often
as
they
meet
their
enemies
would
despise
such
holiday
play
among
their
friends
we
do
to
be
sure
reward
them
as
your
ancients
did
we
do
banish
them
nor
put
them
to
death
for
saving
their
country
like
your
athenians
we
do
pay
them
with
a
trumpery
wreath
like
your
romans
we
english
do
put
our
conquerors
off
with
leaves
we
give
them
fruits
as
cheerfully
bestowed
as
they
are
fairly
earned
god
bless
them
i
would
reduce
my
table
to
one
dish
my
hall
to
one
servant
my
stable
to
one
and
my
kennel
to
one
pointer
rather
than
abridge
the
preservers
of
old
england
of
a
feather
signal
exploits
if
nationally
beneficial
said
sir
john
deserve
substantial
remuneration
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
public
honors
are
valuable
not
only
as
rewards
but
incitements
they
are
as
politic
as
they
are
just
when
miltiades
and
his
illustrious
ten
thousand
gained
their
immortal
victory
would
not
a
blenheim
erected
on
the
plains
of
marathon
have
stimulated
unborn
soldiers
more
than
the
little
transitory
columns
which
barely
recorded
the
names
of
the
victors
what
warrior
said
carlton
will
hereafter
visit
the
future
palace
of
trafalgar
without
reverence
a
reverence
the
purity
of
which
will
be
in
no
degree
impaired
by
contemplating
such
an
additional
motive
to
emulation
in
answer
to
some
further
observations
of
miss
sparkes
on
the
superiority
of
the
ancient
to
british
patriotism
flam
whose
indignation
now
provoked
him
to
display
his
whole
stock
of
erudition
eagerly
exclaimed
do
you
call
that
patriotism
in
your
favorite
athenians
to
be
so
fond
of
as
not
only
to
devote
the
money
of
the
state
to
the
but
to
make
it
capital
to
divert
a
little
of
it
to
the
wants
of
the
gallant
soldiers
who
were
fighting
their
battles
i
hate
to
hear
fellows
called
patriots
who
preferred
their
diversions
to
their
country
then
erecting
himself
as
if
he
felt
the
taller
for
being
an
englishman
he
added
what
madam
sparkes
would
your
greeks
have
said
to
a
patriotic
fund
by
private
contribution
of
nearly
half
a
million
in
the
midst
of
heavy
taxes
and
a
tedious
war
voluntarily
raised
and
cheerfully
given
to
the
orphans
widows
and
mothers
of
their
brave
countrymen
who
fell
in
their
defense
were
the
poor
soldiers
who
fought
under
your
cimons
and
your
i
forget
their
names
ever
so
kindly
remembered
make
it
out
that
they
were
show
me
such
a
spirit
among
your
ancients
and
i
turn
republican
miss
sparkes
having
again
said
something
which
he
thought
tended
to
exalt
the
ancient
states
at
the
expense
of
our
own
country
flam
indignantly
replied
tell
me
madam
did
your
athens
or
your
sparta
or
your
rome
ever
take
in
seven
thousand
starving
priests
driven
from
a
country
with
which
they
were
at
war
a
country
they
had
reason
to
hate
of
a
religion
they
detested
did
they
ever
receive
them
i
say
maintain
them
like
gentlemen
and
caress
them
like
friends
if
you
can
bring
me
one
such
instance
i
will
give
up
old
england
and
turn
greek
or
roman
or
any
thing
but
frenchman
i
should
be
inclined
said
stanley
to
set
down
that
noble
deed
to
the
account
of
our
national
religion
as
well
as
of
our
national
generosity
miss
sparkes
said
in
one
respect
however
flam
imitates
the
french
whom
he
is
abusing
he
is
very
apt
to
triumph
where
he
has
gained
no
victory
if
you
hear
his
account
of
a
defeat
you
would
take
it
like
theirs
for
a
conquest
she
added
however
that
there
were
illustrious
men
in
other
countries
beside
our
own
as
their
successes
testified
for
her
part
she
was
a
citizen
of
the
world
and
honored
heroes
wherever
they
were
found
in
macedon
in
sweden
or
even
in
france
true
enough
rejoined
flam
the
rulers
of
other
countries
have
gone
about
and
delivered
kingdoms
as
we
are
doing
but
there
is
this
difference
they
free
them
from
mild
masters
to
make
them
their
own
slaves
we
neither
get
them
for
ourselves
or
our
minions
our
brothers
or
cousins
our
jeromes
or
josephs
raise
the
weak
pull
down
the
prosperous
if
redeem
kingdoms
is
to
bestow
them
on
their
own
lawful
kings
if
we
help
this
nation
is
to
recall
one
sovereign
from
banishment
if
we
assist
that
is
to
deliver
him
from
captivity
what
a
scene
for
spain
said
sir
john
to
behold
in
us
their
own
national
quixotism
soberly
exemplified
and
rationally
realized
the
generous
theory
of
their
romantic
brought
into
actual
practice
the
fervor
without
the
absurdity
the
sound
principle
of
justice
without
the
extravagance
of
fancy
wrongs
redressed
and
rights
restored
and
upon
the
grandest
scale
deliverance
wrought
not
for
imaginary
princesses
but
for
deposed
and
imprisoned
monarchs
injuries
avenged
not
the
ideal
injuries
of
ridiculous
individuals
but
the
substantial
wrongs
of
plundered
empires
sir
john
who
was
amused
with
the
oddities
of
flam
was
desirous
of
still
provoking
him
to
talk
much
effort
indeed
was
not
required
to
induce
him
to
do
what
he
was
fond
of
doing
whenever
there
was
an
opportunity
of
contradicting
miss
sparkes
but
flam
said
sir
john
you
were
interrupted
as
you
began
to
enumerate
the
inconsistencies
which
you
said
had
put
you
out
of
love
with
the
world
why
it
makes
me
mad
replied
he
to
hear
men
who
make
the
loudest
outcry
about
the
dangers
of
the
state
cramming
their
houses
with
french
governesses
french
cooks
and
french
valets
is
not
this
adding
flame
to
the
fire
then
i
have
no
patience
to
see
people
who
pretend
great
zeal
for
the
church
delighted
that
an
italian
singer
should
have
a
larger
revenue
than
the
highest
of
our
own
bishops
such
patriots
might
have
done
well
enough
for
athenians
added
he
looking
exultingly
at
miss
sparkes
but
they
make
miserable
englishmen
then
i
hate
to
see
fellows
who
pay
least
taxes
complaining
most
of
the
burden
those
who
most
lament
the
hardness
of
the
times
spending
money
in
needless
extravagance
and
luxury
increasing
in
exact
proportion
as
means
diminish
then
i
am
sick
of
the
conceit
of
the
boys
and
girls
do
but
observe
how
their
vanity
imposes
on
their
understanding
and
how
names
disguise
things
my
son
would
start
if
i
were
to
desire
him
to
go
to
london
in
the
but
he
himself
into
the
with
great
coolness
if
i
were
to
talk
to
fan
about
living
in
a
she
would
not
give
me
the
hearing
whereas
she
is
quite
wild
to
live
in
a
i
do
not
quite
agree
with
you
flam
said
sir
john
smiling
as
to
the
inconsistency
of
the
world
i
rather
lament
its
dull
uniformity
if
we
may
rely
on
those
living
chronicles
the
newspapers
all
is
one
faultless
scene
of
monotonous
perfection
were
it
otherwise
i
presume
those
frugal
philologers
would
not
keep
a
set
of
phrases
ready
cut
and
dried
in
order
to
apply
them
universally
in
all
cases
for
instance
is
not
every
public
place
from
james
to
otaheite
or
the
cape
invariably
with
beauty
and
is
not
every
public
sermon
pronounced
to
be
is
not
every
civic
speech
every
provincial
harangue
and
and
is
not
every
military
corps
from
the
veteran
regiment
of
regulars
to
the
volunteer
company
of
a
month
standing
always
declared
to
be
the
highest
state
of
before
the
company
went
away
i
observed
that
carlton
gave
lucilla
a
significant
glance
and
both
withdrew
together
in
spite
of
my
thorough
belief
of
the
injustice
and
absurdity
of
my
suspicions
a
pang
darted
through
my
heart
at
the
bare
possibility
that
lord
staunton
might
be
the
subject
of
this
secret
conference
i
was
perfectly
assured
that
miss
stanley
would
never
accept
him
while
he
retained
his
present
character
but
that
character
might
be
improved
she
had
rejected
him
for
his
principles
if
these
principles
were
changed
there
was
no
other
reasonable
ground
of
objection
he
might
be
reformed
dare
i
own
even
to
myself
that
i
dreaded
to
hear
of
his
reformation
i
hate
myself
for
the
thought
i
will
said
i
faintly
endeavor
to
rejoice
if
it
be
so
i
felt
a
conflict
in
my
mind
between
my
principles
and
my
passion
that
distressed
me
not
a
little
my
integrity
had
never
before
been
so
assailed
at
length
they
returned
i
earnestly
examined
their
countenances
both
looked
cheerful
and
even
animated
yet
it
was
evident
from
the
redness
of
their
eyes
that
they
had
been
weeping
the
company
immediately
took
their
leave
all
our
party
as
it
was
a
fine
evening
attended
them
out
to
their
carriages
except
miss
stanley
she
only
pressed
the
hand
of
carlton
smiled
and
looking
as
if
she
durst
not
trust
herself
to
talk
to
her
withdrew
to
the
bow
window
from
whence
she
could
see
them
depart
i
remained
in
the
room
as
she
was
wiping
her
eyes
to
take
away
the
redness
which
was
a
sure
way
to
increase
it
i
ventured
to
join
her
and
inquired
with
an
earnestness
i
could
not
conceal
what
had
happened
to
distress
her
these
are
not
tears
of
distress
said
she
sweetly
smiling
i
am
quite
ashamed
that
i
have
so
little
but
carlton
has
given
me
so
much
pleasure
i
have
caught
the
infection
of
her
joy
though
my
foolish
sympathy
looks
more
like
sorrow
surely
said
i
indignantly
to
myself
she
will
not
own
lord
staunton
love
to
my
face
all
frank
and
open
as
miss
stanley
was
i
was
afraid
to
press
her
i
had
not
courage
to
ask
what
i
longed
to
know
though
lord
renewed
addresses
might
not
give
them
so
much
pleasure
yet
his
reformation
i
knew
would
i
now
looked
so
earnestly
inquisitive
at
lucilla
that
she
said
my
poor
friend
is
at
last
quite
happy
i
know
you
will
rejoice
with
us
carlton
has
for
some
time
regularly
read
the
bible
with
her
he
condescends
to
hear
her
and
to
invite
her
remarks
telling
her
that
if
he
is
the
better
classic
she
is
the
better
christian
and
that
their
assistance
in
the
things
which
each
understands
must
be
reciprocal
if
he
is
her
teacher
in
human
literature
he
says
she
must
be
his
in
that
which
is
divine
he
has
been
very
earnest
to
get
his
mind
imbued
with
scriptural
knowledge
but
this
is
not
all
last
saturday
he
said
to
her
i
have
but
one
complaint
to
make
of
you
and
it
is
for
a
fault
which
i
always
thought
would
be
the
last
i
should
ever
have
to
charge
you
with
it
is
selfishness
carlton
was
a
little
shocked
though
the
tenderness
of
his
manner
mitigated
her
alarm
resumed
he
intend
to
go
to
heaven
without
your
husband
i
know
you
always
retire
to
your
not
only
for
your
private
devotions
but
to
read
prayers
to
your
maids
what
have
your
done
what
has
your
husband
done
that
they
should
be
excluded
is
it
not
a
little
selfish
my
henrietta
added
he
smiling
confine
your
zeal
to
the
eternal
happiness
of
your
own
sex
will
you
allow
me
and
our
to
join
you
is
sunday
we
will
then
if
you
please
begin
in
the
hall
you
shall
prepare
what
you
would
have
read
and
i
will
be
your
chaplain
a
most
unworthy
one
henrietta
i
confess
but
you
will
not
only
have
a
chaplain
of
your
own
making
but
a
christian
also
my
dear
lucilla
continued
carlton
i
know
what
true
happiness
was
till
that
moment
my
husband
with
all
his
faults
had
always
been
remarkably
sincere
indeed
his
aversion
to
all
hypocrisy
had
made
him
keep
back
his
right
feelings
and
sentiments
till
he
was
assured
they
were
well
established
in
his
mind
he
has
for
some
time
been
regular
at
church
a
thing
he
said
too
much
taken
up
as
a
customary
form
to
be
remarkable
and
which
therefore
involved
not
much
but
family
prayer
adopted
from
conviction
of
its
being
a
duty
rather
pledged
a
man
to
consistent
religion
never
i
hope
shall
i
forget
the
joy
i
felt
nor
my
gratitude
to
that
from
whom
all
holy
desires
proceed
when
with
all
his
family
kneeling
solemnly
around
him
i
heard
my
once
unhappy
husband
with
a
sober
fervor
begin
the
lord
our
god
belong
mercies
and
forgivenesses
though
we
have
rebelled
against
him
neither
have
we
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
lord
our
god
to
walk
in
his
laws
which
he
set
before
us
he
evidently
struggled
with
his
own
feelings
but
his
manly
mind
carried
him
through
with
an
admirable
mixture
of
dignity
and
feeling
he
was
so
serenely
cheerful
the
rest
of
the
evening
that
i
felt
he
had
obtained
a
great
victory
over
himself
and
his
heart
was
at
peace
within
him
prayer
with
him
was
not
a
beginning
form
but
a
consummation
of
his
better
purposes
the
sweet
girl
could
not
forbear
weeping
again
while
she
was
giving
me
this
interesting
account
i
felt
as
if
i
had
never
loved
her
till
then
to
see
her
so
full
of
sensibility
without
the
slightest
tincture
of
romance
so
feeling
yet
so
enchanted
me
i
could
now
afford
to
wish
heartily
for
lord
staunton
reformation
because
it
was
not
likely
to
interfere
with
my
hopes
and
now
the
danger
was
over
i
even
endeavored
to
make
myself
believe
that
i
have
wished
it
in
any
event
so
treacherous
will
the
human
heart
be
found
by
those
who
watch
its
motions
and
it
proceeds
from
not
watching
them
that
the
generality
are
so
little
acquainted
with
the
evils
which
lurk
within
it
before
i
had
time
to
express
half
what
i
felt
to
the
fair
narrator
the
party
came
in
they
seemed
as
much
puzzled
at
the
position
in
which
they
found
lucilla
and
myself
she
wiping
her
eyes
and
i
standing
by
in
admiration
as
i
had
been
at
her
mysterious
interview
with
carlton
the
belfields
knew
not
what
to
make
of
it
the
mother
looks
expressed
astonishment
and
anxiety
the
father
eye
demanded
an
explanation
all
this
mute
eloquence
passed
in
an
instant
miss
stanley
gave
them
not
time
to
inquire
she
flew
to
her
mother
and
eagerly
repeated
the
little
tale
which
furnished
matter
for
grateful
joy
and
improving
conversation
the
rest
of
the
evening
stanley
expressed
a
thorough
confidence
in
the
sincerity
of
carlton
he
had
always
continued
he
in
his
worst
days
an
abhorrence
of
deceit
and
such
a
dread
of
people
appearing
better
than
they
are
that
he
even
commended
that
most
absurd
practice
of
dean
swift
who
you
know
used
to
perform
family
prayers
in
a
garret
for
fear
any
one
should
call
in
and
detect
him
in
the
performance
carlton
defended
this
as
an
honorable
instance
of
swift
abhorrence
of
ostentation
in
religion
i
opposed
it
on
the
more
probable
ground
of
his
being
ashamed
of
it
for
allowing
what
however
never
can
be
allowed
that
an
ordinary
man
might
have
some
excuse
for
the
dread
of
being
sneered
at
as
wanting
to
be
thought
righteous
overmuch
yet
in
a
churchman
in
a
dignified
churchman
family
prayer
would
be
expected
as
a
customary
decency
an
indispensable
appendage
to
his
situation
which
though
it
might
be
practiced
without
piety
could
not
be
omitted
without
disgrace
and
which
even
a
sensible
infidel
considering
it
merely
as
a
professional
act
could
not
say
was
a
custom
more
honored
in
the
breach
than
the
observance
chapter
xxxvii
one
evening
which
tyrrel
happened
to
spend
with
us
after
stanley
had
performed
the
family
devotions
tyrrel
said
to
him
stanley
i
do
much
like
the
prayer
you
read
it
seems
by
the
great
stress
it
lays
on
holiness
to
imply
that
a
man
has
something
in
his
own
power
you
did
indeed
mention
the
necessity
of
faith
and
the
power
of
grace
but
there
was
too
much
about
making
the
life
holy
as
if
that
were
all
in
all
you
seem
to
be
putting
us
so
much
upon
working
and
doing
that
you
leave
nothing
to
do
for
the
saviour
i
wish
replied
stanley
as
i
am
no
deep
theologian
that
you
had
started
this
objection
before
barlow
went
away
for
i
know
no
man
more
able
or
more
willing
for
serious
discussion
no
replied
tyrrel
i
see
clearly
by
some
things
he
dropped
in
conversation
as
well
as
by
the
whole
tenor
of
his
sermons
that
barlow
and
i
should
never
agree
he
means
well
but
knows
little
he
sees
something
but
feels
nothing
more
argument
than
unction
too
much
reasoning
and
too
little
religion
a
little
light
and
no
heat
he
seems
to
me
so
to
the
ship
with
duties
that
it
will
sink
by
the
very
means
he
takes
to
keep
it
afloat
i
thank
god
my
own
eyes
are
opened
and
i
at
last
feel
comfortable
in
my
mind
religious
comfort
said
stanley
is
a
high
attainment
only
it
is
incumbent
on
every
christian
to
be
assured
that
if
he
is
happy
it
is
on
safe
grounds
i
have
taken
care
of
that
replied
tyrrel
for
some
years
after
i
had
quitted
my
loose
habits
i
attended
occasionally
at
church
but
found
no
comfort
in
it
because
i
perceived
so
much
was
to
be
and
so
much
was
to
be
but
the
great
doctrines
of
faith
as
opened
to
me
by
have
at
last
given
me
peace
and
liberty
and
i
rest
myself
without
solicitude
on
the
mercy
so
freely
offered
in
the
gospel
no
mistakes
or
sins
of
mine
can
ever
make
me
forfeit
the
divine
favor
let
us
hear
however
replied
stanley
what
the
bible
says
for
as
that
is
the
only
rule
by
which
we
shall
be
judged
hereafter
it
may
be
prudent
to
be
guided
by
it
here
god
says
by
the
prophet
will
put
my
spirit
within
you
but
he
does
this
for
some
purpose
for
he
says
in
the
very
next
words
will
cause
you
to
in
my
statutes
and
for
fear
this
should
not
plainly
enough
inculcate
holiness
he
goes
on
to
say
ye
shall
my
judgments
and
them
show
me
if
you
can
a
single
promise
made
to
an
impenitent
unholy
man
why
said
tyrrel
is
not
the
mercy
of
god
promised
to
the
wicked
in
every
part
of
the
bible
it
is
said
stanley
but
that
is
he
forsake
his
way
this
fondness
for
works
is
in
my
opinion
nothing
else
but
setting
aside
the
free
grace
of
god
quite
the
contrary
so
far
from
setting
it
aside
it
is
the
way
to
glorify
it
for
it
is
by
that
grace
alone
that
we
are
enabled
to
perform
right
actions
for
myself
i
always
find
it
difficult
to
answer
persons
who
in
flying
to
one
extreme
think
they
can
not
too
much
degrade
the
opposite
if
we
give
faith
its
due
prominence
the
mere
moralist
reprobates
our
principles
as
if
we
were
depreciating
works
if
we
magnify
the
beauty
of
holiness
the
advocate
for
exclusive
faith
accuses
us
of
being
its
enemy
for
my
own
part
i
am
persuaded
that
unqualified
trust
is
the
only
ground
of
safety
he
who
can
not
lie
has
indeed
told
us
so
but
trust
in
god
is
humble
dependence
not
presumptuous
security
the
bible
does
not
say
trust
in
the
lord
and
sin
on
but
in
the
lord
and
be
doing
good
we
are
elsewhere
told
that
works
in
us
to
will
and
to
do
there
is
no
getting
over
that
little
word
to
i
suppose
you
allow
the
necessity
of
prayer
certainly
i
do
but
there
are
conditions
to
our
prayers
also
i
regard
iniquity
in
my
heart
the
lord
will
not
hear
me
the
scriptures
affirm
that
we
must
live
on
the
promises
they
are
indeed
the
very
aliment
of
the
christian
life
but
what
are
the
promises
free
pardon
and
eternal
life
to
them
that
are
in
christ
jesus
true
but
who
are
they
that
in
christ
jesus
the
apostle
tells
us
who
walk
not
after
the
flesh
but
after
the
spirit
besides
is
not
holiness
promised
as
well
as
pardon
new
heart
will
i
give
you
and
a
new
spirit
will
i
put
within
you
surely
stanley
you
abuse
the
grace
of
the
gospel
by
pretending
that
man
is
saved
by
his
own
righteousness
no
no
my
dear
tyrrel
it
is
you
who
abuse
it
by
making
god
mercy
set
aside
man
duty
allow
me
to
observe
that
he
who
exalts
the
grace
of
god
with
a
view
to
indulge
himself
in
any
sin
is
deceiving
no
one
but
himself
and
he
who
trusts
in
christ
with
a
view
to
spare
himself
the
necessity
of
watchfulness
humility
and
that
man
depends
upon
christ
for
more
than
he
has
promised
well
stanley
it
appears
to
me
that
you
want
to
patch
up
a
convenient
accommodating
religion
as
if
christ
were
to
do
a
little
and
we
were
to
do
the
rest
a
sort
of
partnership
salvation
and
in
which
man
has
the
larger
share
this
i
fear
is
indeed
the
dangerous
creed
of
many
worldly
christians
no
god
may
be
said
to
do
all
because
he
gives
power
for
all
strength
for
all
grace
for
all
but
this
grace
is
a
principle
a
vital
energy
a
spirit
to
quicken
us
to
make
us
abound
in
holiness
he
does
not
make
his
grace
abound
that
we
may
securely
live
in
sin
but
that
we
may
subdue
it
renounce
it
live
above
it
when
our
saviour
was
upon
earth
there
was
no
one
quality
he
so
uniformly
commended
in
those
who
came
to
be
healed
by
him
as
faith
it
is
most
true
but
we
do
not
meet
in
any
of
them
with
such
a
presumptuous
faith
as
led
them
to
rush
into
diseases
on
purpose
to
show
their
confidence
in
his
power
of
healing
them
neither
are
we
to
in
sin
that
grace
may
abound
you
can
not
but
observe
that
the
faith
of
the
persons
you
mention
was
always
accompanied
with
an
earnest
desire
to
get
rid
of
their
diseases
and
it
is
worth
remarking
that
to
the
words
faith
has
made
thee
whole
is
added
no
lest
a
worse
thing
come
unto
thee
you
can
not
persuade
me
that
any
neglect
or
even
sin
of
mine
can
make
void
the
covenant
of
god
nothing
can
set
side
the
covenant
of
god
which
is
sure
and
steadfast
but
as
for
him
who
lives
in
the
allowed
practice
of
any
sin
it
is
clear
that
he
has
no
part
nor
lot
in
the
matter
it
is
clear
that
he
is
not
one
of
those
whom
god
has
taken
into
the
covenant
that
god
will
keep
his
word
is
most
certain
but
such
a
one
does
not
appear
to
be
the
person
to
whom
that
word
is
addressed
god
as
much
designed
that
you
should
apply
the
faculties
the
power
and
the
will
he
has
given
you
to
a
life
of
holiness
as
he
meant
when
he
gave
you
legs
hands
and
eyes
that
you
should
walk
work
and
see
his
grace
is
not
intended
to
exclude
the
use
of
his
gifts
but
to
perfect
exalt
and
ennoble
them
i
can
produce
a
multitude
of
texts
to
prove
that
christ
has
done
every
thing
and
of
course
has
left
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
to
believe
on
him
let
us
take
the
general
tenor
and
spirit
of
scripture
and
neither
pack
single
texts
together
detached
from
the
connection
in
which
they
stand
nor
be
so
unreasonable
as
to
squeeze
all
the
doctrines
of
christianity
out
of
every
single
text
which
perhaps
was
only
meant
to
inculcate
one
individual
principle
how
consistently
are
the
great
leading
doctrines
of
faith
and
holiness
balanced
and
reconciled
in
every
part
of
the
bible
if
ever
i
have
been
in
danger
of
resting
on
a
mere
dead
faith
by
one
of
those
texts
on
which
you
exclusively
build
in
the
very
next
sentence
perhaps
i
am
aroused
to
active
virtue
by
some
lively
example
or
absolute
command
if
again
i
am
ever
in
danger
as
you
say
of
sinking
the
ship
with
my
proud
duties
the
next
passage
calls
me
to
order
by
some
powerful
injunction
to
renounce
all
confidence
in
my
miserable
defective
virtues
and
to
put
my
whole
trust
in
christ
by
thus
assimilating
the
creed
with
the
commandment
the
bible
becomes
its
own
interpreter
and
perfect
harmony
is
the
result
allow
me
also
to
remark
that
this
invariable
rule
of
exhibiting
the
doctrines
of
scripture
in
their
due
proportion
order
and
relative
connection
is
one
of
the
leading
excellences
in
the
service
of
our
church
while
no
doctrine
is
neglected
or
undervalued
none
is
disproportionately
magnified
at
the
expense
of
the
others
there
is
neither
omission
undue
prominence
nor
exaggeration
there
is
complete
symmetry
and
correct
proportion
i
assert
that
we
are
free
by
the
gospel
from
the
condemnation
of
the
law
but
where
do
you
find
that
we
are
free
from
the
obligation
of
obeying
it
for
my
own
part
i
do
not
combine
the
doctrine
of
grace
to
which
i
most
cordially
assent
with
any
doctrine
which
practically
denies
the
voluntary
agency
of
man
nor
in
my
adoption
of
the
belief
of
that
voluntary
agency
do
i
in
the
remotest
degree
presume
to
abridge
the
sovereignty
of
god
i
adopt
none
of
the
metaphysical
subtilties
none
of
the
abstruse
niceties
of
any
party
nor
do
i
imitate
either
in
the
reprobation
of
the
other
firmly
believing
that
heaven
is
peopled
with
the
humble
and
the
conscientious
out
of
every
class
of
real
christians
still
i
insist
that
if
christ
has
delivered
me
from
sin
sin
can
do
me
no
harm
my
dear
tyrrel
if
the
king
of
your
country
were
a
mighty
general
and
had
delivered
the
land
from
some
powerful
enemy
would
it
show
your
sense
of
the
obligation
or
your
allegiance
as
a
subject
if
you
were
to
join
the
enemy
he
had
defeated
by
so
doing
though
the
country
might
be
saved
you
would
ruin
yourself
let
us
not
then
live
in
confederacy
with
sin
the
power
of
which
indeed
our
redeemer
has
broken
but
both
the
power
and
guilt
of
which
the
individual
is
still
at
liberty
to
incur
stanley
i
remember
when
you
thought
the
gospel
was
all
in
all
i
think
so
still
but
i
am
now
as
i
was
then
for
a
sober
consistent
gospel
a
christianity
which
must
evidence
itself
by
its
fruits
the
first
words
of
the
apostle
after
his
conversion
were
what
wilt
thou
have
me
to
do
when
he
says
run
that
ye
may
obtain
he
could
never
mean
that
we
could
obtain
by
sitting
still
nor
would
he
have
talked
of
if
he
meant
that
we
should
not
labor
at
all
we
dare
not
persist
in
any
thing
that
is
wrong
or
neglect
any
thing
that
is
right
from
an
erroneous
notion
that
we
have
such
an
interest
in
christ
as
will
excuse
us
from
doing
the
one
or
persisting
in
the
other
i
fancy
you
think
that
a
man
salvation
depends
on
the
number
of
good
actions
he
can
muster
together
no
it
is
the
very
spirit
of
christianity
not
to
build
on
this
or
that
actual
work
but
sedulously
to
strive
for
that
temper
and
those
dispositions
which
are
the
seminal
principles
of
all
virtues
and
where
the
heart
struggles
and
prays
for
the
attainment
of
this
state
though
the
man
should
be
placed
in
such
circumstances
as
to
be
able
to
do
little
to
promote
the
welfare
of
mankind
or
the
glory
of
god
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
this
very
habitual
aim
and
bent
of
the
mind
with
humble
sorrow
at
its
low
attainments
is
in
my
opinion
no
slight
degree
of
obedience
but
you
will
allow
that
the
scriptures
affirm
that
christ
is
not
only
a
sacrifice
but
a
refuge
a
consolation
a
rest
blessed
be
god
he
is
indeed
all
these
but
he
is
a
consolation
only
to
the
heavy
laden
a
refuge
to
those
alone
who
forsake
sin
the
rest
he
promises
is
not
a
rest
from
labor
but
from
evil
it
is
a
rest
from
the
drudgery
of
the
world
but
not
from
the
service
of
god
it
is
not
inactivity
but
quietness
of
spirit
not
sloth
but
peace
he
draws
men
indeed
from
slavery
to
freedom
but
not
a
freedom
to
do
evil
or
to
do
nothing
he
makes
his
service
easy
but
not
by
lowering
the
rule
of
duty
not
by
adapting
his
commands
to
the
corrupt
inclinations
of
our
nature
he
communicates
his
grace
gives
fresh
and
higher
motives
to
obedience
and
imparts
peace
and
comfort
not
by
any
abatement
in
his
demands
but
by
this
infusion
of
his
own
grace
and
this
communication
of
his
own
spirit
you
are
a
strange
fellow
according
to
you
we
can
neither
be
saved
by
good
works
nor
without
them
come
tyrrel
you
are
nearer
the
truth
than
you
intended
we
can
not
be
saved
by
the
merit
of
our
good
works
without
setting
at
naught
the
merits
and
death
of
christ
and
we
can
not
be
saved
without
them
unless
we
set
at
naught
god
holiness
and
make
him
a
favorer
of
sin
now
to
this
the
doctrine
of
the
atonement
properly
understood
is
most
completely
hostile
that
this
doctrine
sin
is
one
of
the
false
charges
which
worldly
men
bring
against
vital
christianity
because
they
do
not
understand
the
principle
nor
inquire
into
the
grounds
on
which
it
is
adopted
still
i
think
you
limit
the
grace
of
god
as
if
people
must
be
very
good
first
in
order
to
deserve
it
and
then
he
will
come
and
add
his
grace
to
their
goodness
whereas
grace
has
been
most
conspicuous
in
the
most
notorious
sinners
i
allow
that
the
grace
of
god
has
never
manifested
itself
more
gloriously
than
in
the
conversion
of
notorious
sinners
but
it
is
worth
remarking
that
all
such
with
paul
at
their
head
have
ever
after
been
eminently
more
afraid
than
other
men
of
falling
again
into
sin
they
have
prayed
with
the
greater
earnestness
to
be
delivered
from
the
power
of
it
and
have
continued
to
lament
most
deeply
the
remaining
corruption
of
their
hearts
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
tyrrel
said
he
should
be
inclined
to
entertain
doubts
of
that
man
state
who
could
not
give
an
accurate
account
of
the
time
and
the
manner
in
which
he
was
first
awakened
and
who
had
had
no
sensible
manifestations
of
the
divine
favor
i
believe
replied
stanley
that
my
notions
of
the
evidence
of
being
in
the
favor
of
god
differ
materially
from
yours
if
a
man
feel
in
himself
a
hatred
of
all
sin
without
sparing
his
favorite
corruption
if
he
rest
for
salvation
on
the
promise
of
the
gospel
alone
if
he
maintain
in
his
mind
such
a
sense
of
the
nearness
and
immeasurable
importance
of
eternal
things
as
shall
enable
him
to
use
temporal
things
with
moderation
and
anticipate
their
end
without
dismay
if
he
delight
in
the
worship
of
god
is
zealous
for
his
service
making
glory
the
end
and
aim
of
all
his
actions
if
he
labor
to
fulfill
his
allotted
duties
conscientiously
if
he
love
his
as
the
children
of
the
same
common
father
and
partakers
of
the
same
common
hope
if
he
feel
the
same
compassion
for
the
immortal
interests
as
for
the
worldly
distresses
of
the
unfortunate
forgiving
others
as
he
hopes
to
be
forgiven
if
he
endeavor
according
to
his
measure
and
ability
to
diminish
the
vice
and
misery
with
which
the
world
abounds
man
has
a
solid
ground
of
peace
and
hope
though
he
may
not
have
those
sensible
evidences
which
afford
triumph
and
exultation
in
the
mean
while
the
man
of
a
heated
imagination
who
boasts
of
mysterious
communications
within
is
perhaps
exhibiting
outwardly
unfavorable
marks
of
his
real
state
and
holding
out
by
his
low
practice
discouragements
unfriendly
to
that
religion
of
which
he
professes
himself
a
shining
instance
the
sober
christian
is
as
fully
convinced
that
only
he
who
made
the
heart
can
renew
it
as
the
enthusiast
he
is
as
fully
persuaded
that
his
natural
dispositions
can
not
be
changed
nor
his
affections
purified
but
by
the
agency
of
the
divine
spirit
as
the
fanatic
and
though
he
presume
not
to
limit
omnipotence
to
a
sudden
or
a
gradual
change
yet
he
does
not
think
it
necessary
to
ascertain
the
day
and
the
hour
and
the
moment
contented
to
be
assured
that
whereas
he
was
once
blind
he
now
sees
if
he
does
not
presume
in
his
own
case
to
fix
the
of
he
is
not
less
certain
as
to
its
effects
if
he
can
not
enumerate
dates
and
recapitulate
feelings
he
can
and
does
produce
such
evidence
of
his
improvement
as
virtuous
habits
a
devout
temper
an
humble
and
charitable
spirit
repentance
toward
god
and
faith
in
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
this
gives
an
evidence
less
equivocal
as
existing
more
in
the
heart
than
on
the
lips
and
more
in
the
life
than
in
the
discourse
surely
if
a
plant
be
flourishing
the
branches
green
and
the
fruit
fair
and
abundant
we
may
venture
to
pronounce
these
to
be
indications
of
health
and
vigor
though
we
can
not
ascertain
the
moment
when
the
seed
was
sown
or
the
manner
in
which
it
sprung
up
sir
john
who
had
been
an
attentive
listener
but
had
not
yet
spoken
a
word
now
said
smiling
stanley
you
steer
most
happily
between
the
two
extremes
this
exclusive
cry
of
grace
in
one
party
of
religionists
which
drives
the
opposite
side
into
as
unreasonable
a
clamor
against
it
reminds
me
of
the
queen
of
louis
quatorze
when
the
jesuits
who
were
of
the
made
so
violent
an
outcry
against
the
jasenists
for
no
reason
but
because
they
had
more
piety
than
themselves
her
majesty
was
so
fearful
of
being
thought
to
favor
the
oppressed
side
that
in
the
excess
of
her
party
zeal
she
vehemently
exclaimed
fie
upon
grace
fie
upon
grace
party
violence
continued
stanley
thinks
it
can
never
recede
far
enough
from
the
side
it
opposes
but
how
then
replied
tyrrel
is
our
religion
to
be
known
except
by
our
making
a
profession
of
truths
which
the
irreligious
are
either
ignorant
of
or
oppose
there
is
rejoined
stanley
as
i
have
already
observed
a
more
infallible
criterion
it
is
best
known
by
the
effects
it
produces
on
the
heart
and
on
the
temper
a
religion
which
consists
in
opinions
only
will
not
advance
us
in
our
progress
to
heaven
it
is
apt
to
inflate
the
mind
with
the
pride
of
disputation
and
victory
is
so
commonly
the
object
of
debate
that
eternity
slides
out
of
sight
the
two
cardinal
points
of
our
religion
justification
and
sanctification
are
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
term
correlatives
they
imply
a
reciprocal
relation
nor
do
i
call
that
state
christianity
in
which
either
is
separately
and
exclusively
maintained
the
union
of
these
manifests
the
dominion
of
religion
in
the
heart
by
increasing
its
humility
by
purifying
its
affections
by
setting
it
above
the
contamination
of
the
maxims
and
habits
of
the
world
by
detaching
it
from
the
vanities
of
time
and
elevating
it
to
a
desire
for
the
riches
of
eternity
all
the
exhortations
to
duties
returned
tyrrel
with
which
so
many
sermons
abound
are
only
an
infringement
on
the
liberty
of
a
christian
a
true
believer
knows
of
no
duty
but
faith
no
rule
but
love
love
is
indeed
said
stanley
the
fountain
and
principle
of
all
practical
virtue
but
love
itself
requires
some
regulations
to
direct
its
exertion
some
law
to
guide
its
motions
some
rule
to
prevent
its
aberrations
some
guard
to
hinder
that
which
is
vigorous
from
becoming
eccentric
with
such
a
regulation
such
a
law
such
a
guard
the
divine
ethics
of
the
gospel
have
furnished
us
the
word
of
god
is
as
much
our
rule
as
his
spirit
is
our
guide
or
his
son
our
this
unerring
rule
alone
secures
christian
liberty
from
disorder
from
danger
from
irregularity
from
excess
conformity
to
the
precepts
of
the
redeemer
is
the
most
infallible
proof
of
having
an
interest
in
his
death
we
afterward
insensibly
slid
into
other
subjects
when
tyrrel
like
a
combatant
who
thought
himself
victorious
seemed
inclined
to
return
to
the
charge
the
love
of
money
having
been
mentioned
by
sir
john
with
extreme
severity
tyrrel
seemed
to
consider
it
as
a
venial
failing
and
said
that
both
avarice
and
charity
might
be
constitutional
they
may
be
so
said
stanley
but
christianity
sir
has
a
constitution
of
its
own
a
superinduced
constitution
a
real
christian
not
with
flesh
and
blood
with
his
whether
he
shall
give
or
forbear
to
give
when
it
is
a
clear
duty
and
the
will
of
god
requires
it
if
we
believe
in
the
principles
we
must
adopt
the
conclusions
religion
is
not
an
unproductive
theory
nor
charity
an
unnecessary
an
incidental
consequence
nor
a
contingent
left
to
our
own
choice
you
are
a
classic
tyrrel
and
can
not
have
forgotten
that
in
your
mythological
poets
the
three
pagan
graces
were
always
knit
together
hand
in
hand
the
three
christian
graces
are
equally
inseparable
and
that
the
greatest
of
these
is
charity
that
grand
principle
of
love
of
which
almsgiving
is
only
one
branch
tyrrel
endeavored
to
evade
the
subject
and
seemed
to
intimate
that
true
christianity
might
be
known
without
any
such
evidences
as
stanley
thought
necessary
this
led
the
latter
to
insist
warmly
on
the
vast
stress
which
every
part
of
scripture
laid
on
the
duty
of
charity
its
doctrines
said
he
its
precepts
its
promises
and
its
examples
all
inculcate
it
new
commandment
of
john
pure
and
undefiled
religion
of
james
shall
be
recompensed
at
the
resurrection
of
the
just
of
luke
the
daily
and
hourly
practice
of
him
who
not
only
taught
to
do
good
but
who
went
about
doing
it
store
for
a
good
foundation
against
the
time
to
come
of
paul
nay
in
the
only
full
solemn
and
express
representation
of
the
last
day
which
the
gospel
exhibits
charity
is
not
only
brought
forward
as
a
predominant
a
distinguishing
feature
of
the
righteous
but
a
specific
recompense
seems
to
be
assigned
to
it
when
practiced
on
true
christian
grounds
and
it
is
not
a
little
observable
that
the
only
posthumous
quotation
from
the
sayings
of
our
divine
saviour
which
the
scripture
has
recorded
is
an
encouragement
to
charity
the
words
of
the
lord
jesus
how
he
said
it
is
more
blessed
to
give
than
to
receive
chapter
xxxviii
the
next
afternoon
when
we
were
all
conversing
together
i
asked
stanley
what
opinion
he
held
on
a
subject
which
had
lately
been
a
good
deal
canvassed
the
propriety
of
young
ladies
learning
the
dead
languages
particularly
latin
he
was
silent
stanley
smiled
ph
oe
be
laughed
outright
lucilla
who
had
nearly
finished
making
tea
blushed
excessively
little
celia
who
was
sitting
on
my
knee
while
i
was
teaching
her
to
draw
a
bird
put
an
end
to
the
difficulty
by
looking
up
in
my
face
and
crying
out
why
sir
lucilla
reads
latin
with
papa
every
morning
i
cast
a
timid
eye
on
miss
stanley
who
after
putting
the
sugar
into
the
cream
pot
and
the
tea
into
the
sugar
bason
slid
out
of
the
room
beckoning
ph
oe
be
to
follow
her
poor
lucilla
said
stanley
i
feel
for
her
well
sir
continued
he
you
have
discovered
by
external
what
i
trust
you
would
not
have
soon
found
by
internal
evidence
parents
who
are
in
high
circumstances
yet
from
principle
abridge
their
daughters
of
the
pleasures
of
the
dissipated
part
of
the
world
may
be
allowed
to
substitute
other
pleasures
and
if
the
girl
has
a
strong
inquisitive
mind
they
may
direct
it
to
such
pursuits
as
call
for
vigorous
application
and
the
exercise
of
the
mental
powers
how
does
that
sweet
girl
manage
said
lady
belfield
to
be
so
utterly
void
of
pretension
so
much
softness
and
so
much
usefulness
strip
her
of
all
the
terrors
of
learning
at
first
replied
stanley
i
only
meant
to
give
lucilla
as
much
latin
as
would
teach
her
to
grammaticize
her
english
but
her
quickness
in
acquiring
led
me
on
and
i
think
i
did
right
for
it
is
superficial
knowledge
that
excites
vanity
a
learned
language
which
a
discreet
woman
will
never
produce
in
company
is
less
likely
to
make
her
vain
than
those
acquirements
which
are
always
in
exhibition
and
after
all
it
is
a
hackneyed
remark
that
the
best
instructed
girl
will
have
less
learning
than
a
and
why
should
vanity
operate
in
her
case
more
than
in
his
for
this
single
reason
sir
said
i
that
every
body
knows
that
which
very
few
girls
are
taught
suspect
me
not
however
of
censuring
a
measure
which
i
admire
i
hope
the
example
of
your
daughters
will
help
to
raise
the
tone
of
female
education
softly
softly
interrupted
stanley
retrench
your
plural
number
it
is
only
one
girl
out
of
six
that
has
deviated
from
the
beaten
track
i
do
not
expect
many
converts
to
what
i
must
rather
call
my
practice
in
one
instance
than
my
general
opinion
i
am
so
convinced
of
the
prevailing
prejudice
that
the
thing
has
never
been
named
out
of
the
family
if
my
gay
neighbor
miss
rattle
knew
that
lucilla
had
learned
latin
she
would
instantly
find
out
a
few
moments
to
add
that
language
to
her
innumerable
acquirements
because
her
mother
can
afford
to
pay
for
it
and
because
lady
di
dash
has
never
learned
it
i
assure
you
however
laughing
as
he
spoke
i
never
intend
to
smuggle
my
poor
girl
on
any
man
by
concealing
from
him
this
unpopular
attainment
any
more
than
i
would
conceal
any
personal
defect
i
will
honestly
confess
said
sir
john
who
had
not
yet
spoken
that
had
i
been
to
judge
the
case
had
i
met
miss
stanley
under
the
terrifying
persuasion
that
she
was
a
scholar
i
own
i
should
have
met
her
with
a
prejudice
i
should
have
feared
she
might
be
forward
in
conversation
deficient
in
feminine
manners
and
destitute
of
domestic
talents
but
having
had
such
a
fair
occasion
of
admiring
her
engaging
modesty
her
gentle
and
unassuming
tone
in
society
and
above
all
having
heard
from
lady
belfield
how
eminently
she
excels
in
the
true
science
of
a
lady
domestic
knowledge
i
can
not
refuse
her
that
additional
regard
which
this
solid
acquirement
so
meekly
borne
deserves
nor
on
reflection
do
i
see
why
we
should
be
so
forward
to
instruct
a
woman
in
the
language
spoken
at
rome
in
its
present
degraded
state
in
which
there
are
comparatively
few
authors
to
improve
her
and
yet
be
afraid
that
she
should
be
acquainted
with
that
which
was
its
vernacular
tongue
in
its
age
of
glory
two
thousand
years
ago
and
which
abounds
with
writers
of
supreme
excellence
i
was
charmed
at
these
concessions
from
sir
john
and
exclaimed
with
a
transport
which
i
could
not
restrain
in
our
friends
even
in
our
common
acquaintance
do
we
not
delight
to
associate
with
those
whose
pursuits
have
been
similar
to
our
own
and
who
have
read
the
same
books
how
dull
do
we
find
it
when
civility
compels
us
to
pass
even
a
day
with
an
illiterate
man
shall
we
not
then
delight
in
the
kindred
acquirements
of
a
dearer
friend
shall
we
not
rejoice
in
a
companion
who
has
drawn
though
less
copiously
perhaps
from
the
same
rich
sources
with
ourselves
who
can
relish
the
beauty
we
quote
and
trace
the
allusion
at
which
we
hint
i
do
not
mean
that
is
absolutely
necessary
but
a
man
of
taste
who
has
an
ignorant
wife
can
not
in
her
company
think
his
own
thoughts
nor
speak
his
own
language
his
thoughts
he
will
suppress
his
language
he
will
debase
the
one
from
hopelessness
the
other
from
compassion
he
must
be
continually
lowering
and
diluting
his
meaning
in
order
to
make
himself
intelligible
this
he
will
do
for
the
woman
he
loves
but
in
doing
it
he
will
not
be
happy
she
who
can
not
be
entertained
by
his
conversation
will
not
be
convinced
by
his
reasoning
and
at
length
he
will
find
out
that
it
is
less
trouble
to
lower
his
own
standard
to
hers
than
to
exhaust
himself
in
the
vain
attempt
to
raise
hers
to
his
own
a
fine
charles
spoken
said
sir
john
i
really
believe
though
that
one
reason
why
women
are
so
frivolous
is
that
the
things
they
are
taught
are
not
solid
enough
to
fix
the
attention
exercise
the
intellect
and
fortify
the
understanding
they
learn
little
that
inures
to
reasoning
or
compels
to
patient
meditation
i
consider
the
difficulties
of
a
solid
education
said
stanley
as
a
sort
of
preliminary
course
intended
perhaps
by
providence
as
a
gradual
preparative
for
the
subsequent
difficulties
of
life
as
a
prelude
to
the
acquisition
of
that
solidity
and
firmness
of
character
which
actual
trials
are
hereafter
to
confirm
though
i
would
not
make
instruction
unnecessarily
harsh
and
rugged
yet
i
would
not
wish
to
increase
its
facilities
to
such
a
degree
as
to
weaken
that
robustness
of
mind
which
it
should
be
its
object
to
promote
in
order
to
render
mental
discipline
subservient
to
moral
how
have
you
managed
with
your
other
girls
stanley
said
sir
john
for
though
you
vindicate
general
knowledge
you
profess
not
to
wish
for
general
learning
in
the
sex
far
from
it
replied
stanley
i
am
a
gardener
you
know
and
accustomed
to
study
the
genius
of
the
soil
before
i
plant
most
of
my
daughters
like
the
daughters
of
other
men
have
some
one
talent
or
at
least
propensity
for
parents
are
too
apt
to
mistake
inclination
for
genius
this
propensity
i
endeavor
to
find
out
and
to
cultivate
but
if
i
find
the
natural
bias
very
strong
and
not
very
safe
i
then
labor
to
counteract
instead
of
encouraging
the
tendency
and
try
to
give
it
a
fresh
direction
lucilla
having
a
strong
bent
to
whatever
relates
to
intellectual
taste
i
have
read
over
with
her
the
most
unexceptionable
parts
of
a
few
of
the
best
roman
classics
she
began
at
nine
years
old
for
i
have
remarked
that
it
is
not
learning
much
but
learning
late
which
makes
pedants
ph
oe
be
who
has
a
superabundance
of
vivacity
i
have
in
some
measure
tamed
by
making
her
not
only
a
complete
mistress
of
arithmetic
but
by
giving
her
a
tincture
of
mathematics
nothing
puts
such
a
bridle
on
the
fancy
as
demonstration
a
habit
of
computing
steadies
the
mind
and
subdues
the
soarings
of
imagination
it
sobers
the
vagaries
of
trope
and
figure
substitutes
truth
for
metaphor
and
exactness
for
amplification
this
girl
who
if
she
had
been
fed
on
poetry
and
works
of
imagination
might
have
become
a
miss
sparkes
now
rather
gives
herself
the
airs
of
a
calculator
and
of
a
grave
computist
though
as
in
the
case
of
the
cat
in
the
fable
who
was
metamorphosed
into
a
lady
nature
will
breath
out
as
soon
as
the
scratching
of
a
mouse
is
heard
and
all
ph
oe
philosophy
can
scarcely
keep
her
in
order
if
any
work
of
fancy
comes
in
her
way
to
soften
the
horrors
of
her
fate
however
i
allowed
her
to
read
a
few
of
the
best
things
in
her
favorite
class
when
i
read
to
her
the
more
delicate
parts
of
gulliver
travels
with
which
she
was
enchanted
she
affected
to
be
angry
at
the
voyage
to
laputa
because
it
ridicules
philosophical
science
and
in
brobdignag
she
said
the
proportions
were
not
correct
i
must
however
explain
to
you
that
the
use
which
i
made
of
these
dry
studies
with
ph
oe
be
was
precisely
the
same
which
the
ingenious
cheshire
makes
of
his
steel
machines
for
defective
shapes
to
straiten
a
crooked
tendency
or
strengthen
a
weak
one
having
employed
these
means
to
set
her
mind
upright
and
to
cure
a
wrong
bias
as
that
skillful
gentleman
discards
his
apparatus
as
soon
as
the
patient
becomes
strait
so
have
i
discontinued
these
pursuits
for
i
never
meant
to
make
a
mathematical
lady
jane
has
a
fine
ear
and
a
pretty
voice
and
will
sing
and
play
well
enough
for
any
girl
who
is
not
to
make
music
her
profession
one
or
two
of
the
others
sing
agreeably
the
little
one
who
brought
the
last
nosegay
has
a
strong
turn
for
natural
history
and
we
all
of
us
generally
botanize
a
little
of
an
evening
which
gives
a
fresh
interest
to
our
walks
she
will
soon
draw
plants
and
flowers
pretty
accurately
louisa
also
has
some
taste
in
designing
and
takes
tolerable
sketches
from
nature
these
we
encourage
because
they
are
solitary
pleasures
and
want
no
witnesses
they
all
are
too
eager
to
impart
somewhat
of
what
they
know
to
your
little
favorite
celia
who
is
in
danger
of
picking
up
a
little
of
every
thing
the
sure
way
to
excel
in
nothing
thus
each
girl
is
furnished
with
some
one
source
of
independent
amusement
but
what
would
become
of
them
or
rather
what
would
become
of
their
mother
and
me
if
every
one
of
them
was
a
scholar
a
mathematician
a
singer
a
performer
a
botanist
a
painter
did
we
attempt
to
force
all
these
acquirements
and
a
dozen
more
on
every
girl
all
her
would
be
occupied
about
things
which
will
be
of
no
value
to
her
in
i
need
not
tell
you
that
we
are
carefully
communicating
to
every
one
of
them
that
general
knowledge
which
should
be
common
to
all
gentlewomen
in
unrolling
the
vast
volume
of
ancient
and
modern
history
i
ground
on
it
some
of
my
most
useful
instructions
and
point
out
how
the
truth
of
scripture
is
illustrated
by
the
crimes
and
corruptions
which
history
records
and
how
the
same
pride
covetousness
ambition
turbulence
and
deceit
which
bring
misery
on
empires
destroy
the
peace
of
families
to
history
geography
and
chronology
are
such
indispensable
appendages
that
it
would
be
superfluous
to
insist
on
their
usefulness
as
to
astronomy
while
heavens
declare
the
glory
of
god
it
seems
a
kind
of
impiety
not
to
give
young
people
some
insight
into
it
i
hope
said
sir
john
that
you
do
not
exclude
the
modern
languages
from
your
plan
as
to
the
french
replied
stanley
with
that
thorough
inconsistency
which
is
common
to
man
the
demand
for
it
seems
to
have
risen
in
exact
proportion
as
it
ought
to
have
sunk
i
would
not
however
rob
my
children
of
a
language
in
which
though
there
are
more
books
to
be
avoided
there
are
more
that
deserve
to
be
read
than
in
all
the
foreign
languages

join

in
tearing
you

you
remember
me
my
dear
belfield
replied
stanley
a
warm
admirer
of
the
exquisite
beauties
of
italian
poetry
but
a
father
feels
or
rather
judges
differently
from
the
mere
man
of
taste
and
as
a
father
i
can
not
help
regretting
that
what
is
commonly
put
into
the
hands
of
our
daughters
is
so
amatory
that
it
has
a
tendency
to
soften
those
minds
which
rather
want
to
be
invigorated
there
are
few
things
i
more
deprecate
for
girls
than
a
poetical
education
the
evils
of
which
i
saw
sadly
exemplified
in
a
young
friend
of
stanley
she
had
beauty
and
talents
her
parents
enchanted
with
both
left
her
entirely
to
her
own
guidance
she
yielded
herself
up
to
the
uncontrolled
rovings
of
a
vagrant
fancy
when
a
child
she
wrote
verses
which
were
shown
in
her
presence
to
every
guest
their
flattery
completed
her
intoxication
she
afterward
translated
italian
sonnets
and
composed
elegies
of
which
love
was
the
only
theme
these
she
was
encouraged
by
her
mother
to
recite
herself
in
all
companies
with
a
pathos
and
sensibility
which
delighted
her
parents
but
alarmed
her
more
prudent
friends
she
grew
up
with
the
confirmed
opinion
that
the
two
great
and
sole
concerns
of
human
life
were
love
and
poetry
she
considered
them
as
inseparably
connected
and
she
resolved
in
her
own
instance
never
to
violate
so
indispensable
a
union
the
object
of
her
affection
was
unhappily
chosen
and
the
effects
of
her
attachment
were
such
as
might
have
been
expected
from
a
connexion
formed
on
so
slight
a
foundation
in
the
perfections
with
which
she
invested
her
lover
she
gave
the
reins
to
her
imagination
when
she
thought
she
was
only
consulting
her
heart
she
picked
out
and
put
together
the
fine
qualities
of
all
the
heroes
of
all
the
poets
she
had
ever
read
and
into
this
finished
creature
her
fancy
transformed
her
admirer
love
and
poetry
commonly
influence
the
two
sexes
in
a
very
disproportionate
degree
with
men
each
of
them
is
only
one
passion
among
many
love
has
various
and
powerful
competitors
in
hearts
divided
between
ambition
business
and
pleasure
poetry
is
only
one
amusement
in
minds
distracted
by
a
thousand
tumultuous
pursuits
whereas
in
girls
of
ardent
tempers
whose
feelings
are
not
curbed
by
restraint
and
regulated
by
religion
love
is
considered
as
the
great
business
of
their
earthly
existence
it
is
cherished
not
as
cordial
drop
but
as
the
whole
contents
of
the
cup
the
remainder
is
considered
only
as
froth
or
dregs
the
unhappy
victim
not
only
submits
to
the
destructive
dominion
of
a
despotic
passion
but
glories
in
it
so
at
least
did
this
girl
the
sober
duties
of
a
family
had
early
been
transferred
to
her
sisters
as
far
beneath
the
attention
of
so
fine
a
genius
while
she
abandoned
herself
to
studies
which
kept
her
imagination
in
a
fever
and
to
a
passion
which
those
studies
continually
fed
and
inflamed
both
together
completed
her
delirium
she
was
ardent
generous
and
sincere
but
violent
imprudent
and
vain
to
excess
she
set
the
opinion
of
the
world
at
complete
defiance
and
was
not
only
totally
destitute
of
judgment
and
discretion
herself
but
despised
them
in
others
her
lover
and
her
muse
were
to
her
instead
of
the
whole
world
after
having
for
some
years
exchanged
sonnets
under
the
names
of
laura
and
petrarch
and
elegies
under
those
of
sappho
and
phaon
the
lover
to
whom
all
this
had
been
mere
sport
the
gratification
of
vanity
and
the
recreation
of
an
idle
hour
grew
weary
younger
and
fairer
he
another
saw
he
drew
off
her
verses
were
left
unanswered
her
reproaches
unpitied
laura
wept
and
sappho
raved
in
vain
the
poor
girl
to
whom
all
this
visionary
romance
had
been
a
serious
occupation
which
had
swallowed
up
cares
and
duties
now
realized
the
woes
she
had
so
often
admired
and
described
her
upbraidings
only
served
to
alienate
still
more
the
heart
of
her
deserter
and
her
despair
which
he
had
the
cruelty
to
treat
as
fictitious
was
to
him
a
subject
of
mirth
and
ridicule
her
letters
were
exposed
her
expostulatory
verses
read
at
clubs
and
taverns
and
the
unhappy
sappho
toasted
in
derision
all
her
ideal
refinements
now
degenerated
into
practical
improprieties
the
public
avowal
of
her
passion
drew
on
her
from
the
world
charges
which
she
had
not
merited
her
reputation
was
wounded
her
health
declined
her
peace
was
destroyed
she
experienced
the
dishonors
of
guilt
without
its
turpitude
and
in
the
bloom
of
life
fell
the
melancholy
victim
to
a
mistaken
education
and
an
undisciplined
mind
stanley
dropped
a
silent
tear
to
the
memory
of
her
unhappy
friend
the
energies
of
whose
mind
she
said
would
had
they
been
lightly
directed
have
formed
a
fine
character
but
none
of
the
things
of
which
i
have
been
speaking
resumed
stanley
are
the
great
and
primary
objects
of
instruction
the
inculcation
of
fortitude
prudence
humility
temperance
this
is
education
these
are
things
we
endeavor
to
promote
far
more
than
arts
or
languages
these
are
tempers
the
habit
of
which
should
be
laid
in
early
and
followed
up
constantly
as
there
is
no
day
in
life
which
will
not
call
them
into
exercise
and
how
can
that
be
practiced
which
has
never
been
acquired
perseverance
meekness
and
industry
continued
he
are
the
qualities
we
most
carefully
cherish
and
commend
for
poor
laura
sake
i
make
it
a
point
never
to
extol
any
indications
of
genius
genius
has
pleasure
enough
in
its
own
high
aspirings
nor
am
i
indeed
overmuch
delighted
with
a
great
blossom
of
talents
i
agree
with
good
bishop
hull
that
it
is
better
to
thin
the
blossoms
that
the
rest
may
thrive
and
that
in
encouraging
too
many
propensities
one
faculty
may
not
starve
another
lady
belfield
expressed
herself
grateful
for
the
hints
stanley
had
thrown
out
which
could
not
be
but
of
importance
to
her
who
had
so
large
a
family
after
some
further
questions
from
her
he
proceeded
i
have
partly
explained
to
you
my
dear
madam
why
though
i
would
not
have
every
woman
learn
every
thing
yet
why
i
would
give
every
girl
in
a
certain
station
of
life
some
one
amusing
accomplishment
there
is
here
and
there
a
strong
mind
which
requires
a
more
substantial
nourishment
than
the
common
education
of
girls
affords
to
such
and
to
such
only
would
i
furnish
the
quiet
resource
of
a
dead
language
as
a
solid
aliment
which
may
fill
the
mind
without
inflating
it
but
that
no
acquirement
may
inflate
it
let
me
add
there
is
but
one
sure
corrective
against
learning
against
talents
of
any
kind
nothing
can
steady
the
head
unless
you
fortify
the
heart
with
real
christianity
in
raising
the
moral
edifice
we
must
sink
deep
in
proportion
as
we
build
high
we
must
widen
the
foundation
if
we
extend
the
superstructure
religion
alone
can
counteract
the
aspirings
of
genius
can
regulate
the
pride
of
talents
and
let
such
women
as
are
disposed
to
be
vain
of
their
comparatively
petty
attainments
look
up
with
admiration
to
those
two
cotemporary
shining
examples
the
venerable
elizabeth
carter
and
the
blooming
elizabeth
smith
i
knew
them
both
and
to
know
was
to
revere
them
in
let
our
young
ladies
contemplate
profound
and
various
learning
chastised
by
true
christian
humility
in
let
them
venerate
acquirements
which
would
have
been
distinguished
in
a
university
meekly
softened
and
beautifully
shaded
by
the
gentle
exertion
of
every
domestic
virtue
the
unaffected
exercise
of
every
feminine
employment
chapter
xxxix
ever
since
tyrrel
had
been
last
with
us
i
had
observed
an
unusual
seriousness
in
the
countenance
of
sir
john
belfield
though
accompanied
with
his
natural
complacency
his
mind
seemed
intent
on
something
he
wished
to
communicate
the
first
time
we
were
both
alone
in
the
library
with
stanley
sir
john
said
stanley
the
conversations
we
have
lately
had
and
especially
the
last
in
which
you
bore
so
considerable
a
part
have
furnished
me
with
matter
for
reflection
i
hope
the
pleasure
will
not
be
quite
destitute
of
profit
my
dear
sir
john
replied
stanley
in
conversing
with
tyrrel
i
labor
under
a
disadvantage
common
to
every
man
who
when
he
is
called
to
defend
some
important
principle
which
he
thinks
attacked
or
undervalued
is
brought
into
danger
of
being
suspected
to
undervalue
others
which
if
they
in
their
turn
were
assailed
he
would
defend
with
equal
zeal
when
points
of
the
last
importance
are
slighted
as
insignificant
in
order
exclusively
to
magnify
one
darling
opinion
i
am
driven
to
appear
as
if
i
opposed
that
important
tenet
which
if
i
may
so
speak
seems
pitted
against
the
others
those
who
do
not
previously
know
my
principles
might
almost
suspect
me
of
being
an
opposer
of
that
prime
doctrine
which
i
really
consider
as
the
leading
principle
of
christianity
allow
me
to
say
returned
sir
john
that
my
surprise
has
been
equal
to
my
satisfaction
those
very
doctrines
which
you
maintained
i
had
been
assured
were
the
very
tenets
you
rejected
many
of
our
acquaintance
who
do
not
come
near
enough
to
judge
or
who
would
not
be
competent
to
judge
if
they
did
ascribe
the
strictness
of
your
practice
to
some
unfounded
peculiarities
of
opinion
and
suspect
that
the
doctrines
of
tyrrel
though
somewhat
modified
a
little
more
rationally
conceived
and
more
ably
expressed
are
the
doctrines
held
by
you
and
by
every
man
who
rises
above
the
ordinary
standard
of
what
the
world
calls
religious
men
and
what
is
a
little
absurd
and
inconsistent
they
ascribe
to
these
supposed
dangerous
doctrines
his
abstinence
from
the
diversions
and
his
disapprobation
of
the
manners
and
maxims
of
the
world
opinions
however
i
always
suspected
could
not
be
very
pernicious
the
effects
of
which
from
the
whole
tenor
of
your
life
i
knew
to
be
so
salutary
i
now
find
upon
full
proof
that
there
is
nothing
in
your
sentiments
but
what
a
man
of
sense
may
approve
nothing
but
what
if
he
be
really
a
man
of
sense
he
will
without
scruple
adopt
may
i
be
enabled
more
fully
more
practically
to
adopt
them
you
shall
point
out
to
me
such
a
course
of
reading
as
may
not
only
clear
up
my
remaining
difficulties
but
what
is
infinitely
more
momentous
than
the
solution
of
any
abstract
question
may
help
to
awaken
me
to
a
more
deep
and
lively
sense
of
my
own
individual
interest
in
this
great
concern
stanley
benevolent
countenance
was
lighted
up
with
more
than
its
wonted
animation
he
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
the
deep
satisfaction
with
which
his
heart
was
penetrated
he
modestly
referred
his
friend
to
barlow
as
a
far
more
able
casuist
though
not
a
more
cordial
friend
for
my
own
part
i
felt
my
heart
expand
toward
sir
john
with
new
sympathies
and
an
enlarged
affection
i
felt
noble
motives
of
attachment
an
attachment
which
i
hoped
would
be
perpetuated
beyond
the
narrow
bounds
of
this
perishable
world
my
dear
sir
john
said
stanley
it
is
among
the
daily
but
comparatively
petty
trials
of
every
man
who
is
deeply
in
earnest
to
secure
his
immortal
interests
to
be
classed
with
low
and
wild
enthusiasts
whom
his
judgment
condemns
with
hypocrites
against
whom
his
principles
revolt
and
with
men
pious
and
conscientious
i
am
most
willing
to
allow
but
differing
widely
from
his
own
views
with
others
who
evince
a
want
of
charity
in
some
points
and
a
want
of
judgment
in
most
to
be
identified
i
say
with
men
so
different
from
yourself
because
you
hold
in
common
some
great
truths
which
all
real
christians
have
held
in
all
ages
and
because
you
agree
with
them
in
avoiding
the
blamable
excesses
of
dissipation
is
among
the
sacrifices
of
reputation
which
a
man
must
be
contented
to
make
who
is
earnest
in
the
great
object
of
a
christian
pursuit
i
trust
however
that
through
divine
grace
i
shall
never
renounce
my
integrity
for
the
praise
of
men
who
have
so
little
consistency
that
though
they
pretend
their
quarrel
is
with
your
faith
yet
who
would
not
care
how
extravagant
your
belief
was
if
your
practice
assimilated
with
their
own
i
trust
on
the
other
hand
that
i
shall
always
maintain
my
candor
toward
those
with
whom
we
are
unfairly
involved
men
religious
though
somewhat
eccentric
devout
though
injudicious
and
sincere
though
mistaken
but
who
with
all
their
errors
against
which
i
protest
and
with
all
their
indiscretion
which
i
lament
and
with
all
their
because
irregular
zeal
i
shall
ever
think
always
excepting
hypocrites
and
false
pretenders
are
better
men
and
in
a
safer
state
than
their
revilers
i
have
often
suspected
said
i
that
under
the
plausible
pretense
of
objecting
to
your
creed
men
conceal
their
quarrel
with
the
commandments
my
dear
stanley
said
sir
john
but
for
this
visit
i
might
have
continued
in
the
common
error
that
there
was
but
one
description
of
religious
professors
that
a
fanatical
spirit
and
a
fierce
adoption
of
one
or
two
particular
doctrines
to
the
exclusion
of
all
the
rest
with
a
total
indifference
to
morality
and
a
sovereign
contempt
of
prudence
made
up
the
character
against
which
i
confess
i
entertained
a
secret
disgust
still
however
i
loved
too
well
and
had
too
high
an
opinion
of
your
understanding
to
suspect
that
you
would
ever
be
drawn
into
those
practical
errors
to
which
i
had
been
told
your
theory
inevitably
led
yet
i
own
i
had
an
aversion
to
this
dreaded
enthusiasm
which
drove
me
into
the
opposite
extreme
how
many
men
have
i
known
replied
stanley
smiling
who
from
their
dread
of
a
burning
zeal
have
taken
refuge
in
a
freezing
indifference
as
to
the
two
extremes
of
heat
and
cold
neither
of
them
is
the
true
climate
of
christianity
yet
the
fear
of
each
drives
men
of
opposite
complexions
into
the
other
instead
of
fixing
them
in
the
temperate
zone
which
lies
between
them
and
which
is
the
region
of
genuine
piety
the
truth
is
sir
john
society
considers
ardor
in
religion
as
the
fever
of
a
distempered
understanding
while
in
inferior
concerns
they
admire
it
as
the
indication
of
a
powerful
mind
is
zeal
in
politics
accounted
the
mark
of
a
vulgar
intellect
did
they
consider
the
unquenchable
ardor
of
pitt
did
they
regard
the
lofty
enthusiasm
of
fox
as
evidences
of
a
feeble
or
a
disordered
mind
yet
i
will
venture
to
assert
that
ardor
in
religion
is
as
much
more
noble
than
ardor
in
politics
as
the
prize
for
which
it
contends
is
more
exalted
it
is
beyond
all
comparison
superior
to
the
highest
human
interests
the
truth
and
justice
of
which
after
all
may
possibly
be
mistaken
and
the
objects
of
which
must
infallibly
have
an
end
barlow
came
in
and
seeing
us
earnestly
engaged
desired
that
he
might
not
interrupt
the
conversation
sir
john
in
a
few
words
informed
him
what
had
passed
and
with
a
most
graceful
humility
spoke
of
his
own
share
in
it
and
confessed
how
much
he
had
been
carried
away
by
the
stream
of
popular
prejudice
respecting
men
who
had
courage
to
make
a
consistent
profession
of
christianity
i
now
added
he
begin
to
think
with
addison
that
singularity
in
religion
is
heroic
bravery
it
only
leaves
the
species
by
soaring
above
it
after
some
observations
from
barlow
much
in
point
he
went
on
to
remark
that
the
difficulties
of
a
clergyman
were
much
increased
by
the
altered
manners
of
the
age
the
tone
of
religious
writing
said
he
but
especially
the
tone
of
religious
conversation
is
much
lowered
the
language
of
a
christian
minister
in
discussing
christian
topics
will
naturally
be
consonant
to
that
of
scripture
the
scripture
speaks
of
a
man
being
in
the
spirit
of
his
of
his
being
by
the
grace
of
now
how
much
circumlocution
is
necessary
for
us
in
conversing
with
a
man
of
the
world
to
convey
the
sense
without
adopting
the
expression
and
what
pains
must
we
take
to
make
our
meaning
intelligible
without
giving
disgust
and
to
be
useful
without
causing
irritation
but
my
good
doctor
said
sir
john
is
it
not
a
little
puritanical
to
make
use
of
such
solemn
expressions
in
company
sir
replied
barlow
it
is
worse
than
puritanical
it
is
hypocritical
where
the
principle
itself
does
not
exist
and
even
where
it
does
it
is
highly
inexpedient
to
introduce
such
phrases
into
general
company
at
all
but
i
am
speaking
of
serious
private
conversation
when
if
a
minister
is
really
in
earnest
there
is
nothing
absurd
in
his
prudent
use
of
scripture
expressions
one
great
difficulty
and
which
obstructs
the
usefulness
of
a
clergyman
in
conversation
with
many
persons
of
the
higher
class
who
would
be
sorry
not
to
be
thought
religious
is
that
they
keep
up
so
little
acquaintance
with
the
bible
that
from
their
ignorance
of
its
venerable
phraseology
they
are
offended
at
the
introduction
of
a
text
not
because
it
is
scripture
for
that
they
maintain
a
kind
of
general
reverence
but
because
from
not
reading
it
they
do
not
know
that
it
scripture
i
once
lent
a
person
of
rank
and
talents
an
admirable
sermon
written
by
one
of
our
first
divines
though
deeply
pious
it
was
composed
with
uncommon
spirit
and
elegance
and
i
thought
it
did
not
contain
one
phrase
which
could
offend
the
most
fastidious
critic
when
he
returned
it
he
assured
me
that
he
liked
it
much
on
the
whole
and
should
have
approved
it
altogether
but
for
one
methodistical
expression
to
my
utter
astonishment
he
pointed
to
the
exceptionable
passage
is
now
no
condemnation
to
them
that
are
in
christ
jesus
who
walk
not
after
the
flesh
but
after
the
spirit
the
chapter
and
verse
not
being
mentioned
he
never
suspected
it
was
a
quotation
from
the
bible
this
is
one
among
many
reasons
said
stanley
why
i
so
strenuously
insist
that
young
persons
should
read
the
scriptures
unaltered
unmodernized
unmutilated
unabridged
if
parents
do
not
make
a
point
of
this
the
peculiarity
of
sacred
language
will
become
really
obsolete
to
the
next
generation
in
answer
to
some
further
remarks
of
sir
john
stanley
said
smiling
i
have
sometimes
amused
myself
with
making
a
collection
of
certain
things
which
are
now
considered
and
held
up
by
a
pretty
large
class
of
men
as
the
infallible
symptoms
of
methodism
those
which
at
present
occur
to
my
recollection
are
the
following
going
to
church
in
the
afternoon
maintaining
family
prayer
not
traveling
or
giving
great
dinners
or
other
entertainments
on
sundays
rejoicing
in
the
abolition
of
the
promoting
the
religious
instruction
of
the
poor
at
home
subscribing
to
the
bible
society
and
contributing
to
establish
christianity
abroad
these
though
the
man
attend
no
eccentric
clergyman
hold
no
one
enthusiastic
doctrine
associate
with
no
fanatic
is
sober
in
his
conversation
consistent
in
his
practice
correct
in
his
whole
deportment
will
infallibly
fix
on
him
the
charge
of
methodism
any
of
these
will
excite
suspicion
but
all
united
will
not
fail
absolutely
to
stigmatize
him
the
most
devoted
attachment
to
the
establishment
will
avail
him
nothing
if
not
accompanied
with
a
fiery
intolerance
toward
all
who
differ
without
intolerance
his
charity
is
construed
into
unsoundness
and
his
candor
into
disaffection
he
is
accused
of
assimilating
with
the
principles
of
every
weak
brother
whom
though
his
judgment
compels
him
to
blame
his
candor
forbids
him
to
calumniate
saint
and
hypocrite
are
now
in
the
scoffer
lexicon
become
convertible
terms
the
last
being
always
implied
where
the
first
is
sneeringly
used
it
has
often
appeared
to
me
said
i
that
the
glory
of
a
tried
christian
somewhat
resembles
that
of
a
roman
victor
in
whose
solemn
processions
among
the
odes
of
gratulation
a
mixture
of
abuse
and
railing
made
part
of
the
triumph
happily
resumed
stanley
a
religious
man
knows
the
worst
he
is
likely
to
suffer
in
the
present
established
state
of
things
he
is
not
called
as
in
the
first
ages
of
christianity
to
be
made
a
spectacle
to
the
world
and
to
angels
and
to
men
but
he
must
submit
to
be
assailed
by
three
different
descriptions
of
persons
from
the
first
he
must
be
contented
to
have
principles
imputed
to
him
which
he
abhors
motives
which
he
disdains
and
ends
which
he
deprecates
he
must
submit
to
have
the
energies
of
his
piety
confounded
with
the
follies
of
the
fanatic
and
his
temperate
zeal
blended
with
the
ravings
of
the
insane
he
must
submit
to
be
involved
in
the
absurdities
of
the
extravagant
in
the
duplicity
of
the
designing
and
in
the
mischiefs
of
the
dangerous
to
be
reckoned
among
the
disturbers
of
that
church
which
he
would
defend
with
his
blood
and
of
that
government
which
he
is
perhaps
supporting
in
every
possible
direction
every
means
is
devised
to
shake
his
credit
from
such
determined
assailants
no
prudence
can
protect
his
character
no
private
integrity
can
defend
it
no
public
service
rescue
it
i
have
often
wondered
said
sir
john
at
the
success
of
attacks
which
seemed
to
have
nothing
but
the
badness
of
the
cause
to
recommend
them
but
the
assailant
whose
object
it
is
to
make
good
men
ridiculous
well
knows
that
he
has
secured
to
himself
a
large
patronage
in
the
hearts
of
all
the
envious
the
malignant
and
the
irreligious
who
like
other
levelers
find
it
more
easy
to
establish
the
equality
of
mankind
by
abasing
the
lofty
than
by
elevating
the
low
in
my
short
experience
of
life
said
i
when
sir
john
had
done
speaking
i
have
often
observed
it
as
a
hardship
that
a
man
must
not
only
submit
to
be
condemned
for
doctrines
he
disowns
but
also
for
consequences
which
others
may
draw
from
the
doctrines
he
maintains
though
he
himself
both
practically
and
speculatively
disavows
any
such
consequences
there
is
another
class
of
enemies
resumed
stanley
to
do
them
justice
it
is
not
so
much
the
individual
christian
as
christianity
itself
which
hope
to
discredit
christianity
which
would
not
only
restrain
the
conduct
but
would
humble
the
heart
which
strips
them
of
the
pride
of
philosophy
and
the
arrogant
plea
of
merit
which
would
save
but
will
not
flatter
them
in
this
enlightened
period
however
for
men
who
would
preserve
any
character
it
would
be
too
gross
to
attack
religion
itself
and
they
find
they
can
wound
her
more
deeply
and
more
creditably
through
the
sides
of
her
professors
i
have
observed
said
i
that
the
uncandid
censurer
always
picks
out
the
worst
man
of
a
class
and
then
confidently
produces
him
as
being
a
fair
specimen
of
it
from
our
more
thoughtless
but
less
uncharitable
acquaintance
the
gay
and
the
busy
resumed
stanley
we
have
to
sustain
a
gentler
warfare
a
little
reproach
a
good
deal
of
ridicule
a
little
suspicion
of
our
designs
and
not
a
little
compassion
for
our
gloomy
habits
of
life
an
implied
contempt
of
our
judgment
some
friendly
hints
that
we
carry
things
too
far
an
intimation
that
being
righteous
overmuch
in
the
practice
has
a
tendency
to
produce
derangement
in
the
faculties
these
are
the
petty
but
daily
trials
of
every
man
who
is
seriously
in
earnest
and
petty
indeed
they
are
to
him
whose
prospects
are
and
whose
hope
is
full
of
immortality
this
hostility
which
a
real
christian
is
sure
to
experience
said
i
is
not
without
its
uses
it
quickens
his
vigilance
over
her
own
heart
and
enlarges
his
charity
toward
others
whom
reproach
perhaps
may
as
unjustly
stigmatize
it
teaches
him
to
be
on
his
guard
lest
he
should
really
deserve
the
censure
he
incurs
and
what
i
presume
is
of
no
small
importance
it
teaches
him
to
sit
loose
to
human
opinion
it
weakens
his
excessive
tenderness
for
reputation
makes
him
more
anxious
to
deserve
and
less
solicitous
to
obtain
it
it
were
well
said
barlow
if
the
evil
ended
here
the
established
christian
will
evince
himself
to
be
such
by
not
shrinking
from
the
attack
but
the
misfortune
is
that
the
dread
of
this
attack
keeps
back
well
disposed
but
vacillating
characters
they
are
intimidated
at
the
idea
of
partaking
the
censure
though
they
know
it
to
be
false
when
they
hear
the
reputation
of
men
of
piety
assailed
they
assume
an
indifference
which
they
are
far
from
feeling
they
listen
to
the
reproaches
cast
on
characters
which
they
inwardly
revere
without
daring
to
vindicate
them
they
hear
the
most
attached
subjects
accused
of
disaffection
and
the
most
churchmen
of
innovation
without
venturing
to
repel
the
charge
lest
they
should
be
suspected
of
leaning
to
the
party
they
are
afraid
fully
to
avow
that
their
own
principles
are
the
same
lest
they
should
be
involved
in
the
same
calumny
to
efface
this
suspicion
they
affect
a
coldness
which
they
do
not
feel
and
treat
with
levity
what
they
inwardly
venerate
very
young
men
from
this
criminal
timidity
are
led
to
risk
their
eternal
happiness
through
the
dread
of
a
laugh
though
they
know
that
they
have
not
only
religion
but
reason
on
their
side
yet
it
requires
a
hardy
virtue
to
repel
a
sneer
and
an
intrepid
principle
to
confront
a
sarcasm
thus
their
own
mind
loses
its
firmness
religion
loses
their
support
the
world
loses
the
benefit
which
their
example
would
afford
and
they
themselves
become
liable
to
the
awful
charge
which
is
denounced
against
him
who
is
ashamed
of
his
christian
profession
men
of
the
world
said
sir
john
are
extremely
jealous
of
whatever
may
be
thought
they
are
frightened
at
every
thing
that
has
not
the
sanction
of
public
opinion
and
the
stamp
of
public
applause
they
are
impatient
of
the
slightest
suspicion
of
censure
in
what
may
be
supposed
to
affect
the
credit
of
their
judgment
though
often
indifferent
enough
as
to
any
blame
that
may
attach
to
their
conduct
they
have
been
accustomed
to
consider
strict
religion
as
a
thing
which
militates
against
good
taste
and
to
connect
the
idea
of
something
unclassical
and
inelegant
something
awkward
and
unpopular
something
uncouth
and
with
the
peculiar
doctrines
of
christianity
doctrines
which
though
there
is
no
harm
in
believing
they
think
there
can
be
no
good
in
avowing
it
is
a
little
hard
said
stanley
that
men
of
piety
who
are
allowed
to
possess
good
sense
on
all
other
occasions
and
whose
judgment
is
respected
in
all
the
ordinary
concerns
of
life
should
not
have
a
little
credit
given
them
in
matters
of
religion
but
that
they
should
be
at
once
transformed
into
idiots
or
madmen
in
that
very
point
which
affords
the
noblest
exercise
to
the
human
faculties
a
christian
then
said
i
if
human
applause
be
his
idol
is
of
all
men
most
miserable
he
forfeits
his
reputation
every
way
he
is
accused
by
the
men
of
the
world
of
going
too
far
by
the
enthusiast
of
not
going
far
enough
while
it
is
one
of
the
best
evidences
of
his
being
right
that
he
is
rejected
by
one
party
for
excess
and
by
the
other
for
deficiency
what
then
is
to
be
done
said
barlow
must
a
discreet
and
pious
man
give
up
a
principle
because
it
has
been
disfigured
by
the
fanatic
or
abused
by
the
hypocrite
or
denied
by
the
skeptic
or
reprobated
by
the
formalist
or
ridiculed
by
the
men
of
the
world
he
should
rather
support
it
with
an
earnestness
proportioned
to
its
value
he
should
rescue
it
from
the
injuries
it
has
sustained
from
its
enemies
and
the
discredit
brought
on
it
by
its
imprudent
friends
he
should
redeem
it
from
the
enthusiasm
which
misconceives
and
from
the
ignorance
or
malignity
which
misrepresents
it
if
the
learned
and
the
judicious
are
silent
in
proportion
as
the
illiterate
and
the
vulgar
are
obtrusive
and
loquacious
the
most
important
truths
will
be
abandoned
by
those
who
are
best
able
to
unfold
and
to
defend
them
while
they
will
be
embraced
exclusively
by
those
who
misunderstand
degrade
and
debase
them
because
the
unlettered
are
absurd
must
the
able
cease
to
be
religious
if
there
is
to
be
an
abandonment
of
every
christian
principle
because
it
has
been
unfairly
unskillfully
or
inadequately
treated
there
would
one
by
one
be
an
abandonment
of
every
doctrine
of
the
new
testament
i
felt
myself
bound
said
stanley
to
act
on
this
principle
in
our
late
conversation
with
tyrrel
i
would
not
refuse
to
assert
with
him
the
doctrines
of
grace
but
i
endeavored
to
let
him
see
that
i
had
adopted
them
in
a
scriptural
sense
i
would
not
try
to
convince
him
that
he
was
wrong
by
disowning
a
truth
because
he
abused
it
i
would
cordially
reject
all
the
bad
use
he
makes
of
any
opinion
without
rejecting
the
opinion
itself
if
the
bible
will
bear
me
out
in
the
belief
of
it
but
i
would
scrupulously
reject
all
the
other
opinions
which
he
connects
with
it
and
with
which
i
am
persuaded
it
has
no
connection
the
nominal
christian
said
barlow
who
insists
that
religion
resides
in
the
understanding
only
may
contend
that
love
to
god
gratitude
to
our
redeemer
and
sorrow
for
our
offenses
are
enthusiastic
extravagances
and
effectually
repress
by
ridicule
and
sarcasm
those
feelings
which
the
devout
heart
recognizes
and
which
scripture
sanctions
on
the
other
hand
those
very
feelings
are
inflamed
exaggerated
distorted
and
misrepresented
as
including
the
whole
of
religion
by
the
intemperate
enthusiast
who
thinks
reason
has
nothing
to
do
in
the
business
but
who
trusting
to
tests
not
warranted
in
the
scripture
is
governed
by
fancies
feelings
and
visions
of
his
own
between
these
pernicious
extremes
what
course
is
the
sober
christian
to
pursue
must
he
discard
from
his
heart
all
pious
affections
because
the
fanatic
abuses
them
and
the
fastidious
denies
their
existence
this
would
be
like
insisting
that
because
one
man
happens
to
be
sick
of
a
dead
palsy
and
another
of
a
frenzy
fever
there
is
therefore
in
the
human
constitution
no
such
temperate
medium
as
sound
health
chapter
xl
since
the
conversation
which
had
accidentally
led
to
the
discovery
of
miss
stanley
acquirements
i
could
not
forbear
surveying
the
perfect
arrangements
of
the
family
and
the
completely
elegant
but
not
luxurious
table
with
more
than
ordinary
interest
i
felt
no
small
delight
in
reflecting
that
all
this
order
and
propriety
were
produced
without
the
smallest
deduction
from
mental
cultivation
i
could
not
refrain
from
mentioning
this
to
stanley
she
was
not
displeased
with
my
observation
though
she
cautiously
avoided
saying
any
thing
which
might
be
construed
into
a
wish
to
set
off
her
daughter
as
she
seemed
surprised
at
my
knowledge
of
the
large
share
her
lucilla
had
in
the
direction
of
the
family
concerns
i
could
not
in
the
imprudence
of
my
satisfaction
conceal
the
conversation
i
had
had
with
my
old
friend
comfit
after
this
avowal
she
felt
that
any
reserve
on
this
point
would
look
like
affectation
a
littleness
which
would
have
been
unworthy
of
her
character
i
am
frequently
blamed
by
my
friends
said
she
for
taking
some
of
the
load
from
my
own
shoulders
and
laying
it
on
hers
thing
she
is
too
young
is
the
constant
cry
of
the
fashionable
mothers
my
general
answer
is
you
do
not
think
your
daughters
of
the
same
age
too
young
to
be
married
though
you
know
marriage
must
bring
with
it
these
and
still
heavier
cares
surely
then
lucilla
is
not
too
young
to
be
initiated
into
that
useful
knowledge
which
will
hereafter
become
no
inconsiderable
part
of
her
duty
the
acquisition
would
be
really
burdensome
then
if
it
were
not
lightened
by
preparatory
practice
now
i
have
i
trust
convinced
my
daughters
that
though
there
is
no
great
merit
in
possessing
this
sort
of
knowledge
yet
to
be
destitute
of
it
is
highly
discreditable
in
several
houses
where
i
had
visited
i
had
observed
the
forwardness
of
the
parents
the
mother
especially
to
make
a
display
of
the
merits
so
dutiful
so
notable
such
an
excellent
nurse
the
girl
was
then
called
out
to
sing
or
to
play
and
was
thus
by
that
which
my
good
mother
deprecated
kept
in
the
full
exhibition
of
those
very
talents
which
are
most
likely
to
interfere
with
nursing
and
notableness
but
since
i
had
been
on
my
present
visit
i
had
never
once
heard
my
friends
extol
their
lucilla
or
bring
forward
any
of
her
excellences
i
had
however
observed
their
eyes
fill
with
a
delight
which
they
could
not
suppress
when
her
merits
were
the
subject
of
the
praise
of
others
i
took
notice
of
this
difference
of
conduct
to
stanley
i
have
often
said
she
been
so
much
hurt
at
the
indelicacy
to
which
you
allude
that
i
very
early
resolved
to
avoid
it
if
the
girl
in
question
does
not
deserve
the
commendation
it
is
not
only
disingenuous
but
dishonest
if
she
does
it
is
a
coarse
and
not
very
honorable
stratagem
for
getting
her
off
but
if
the
daughter
be
indeed
all
that
a
partial
fondness
believes
added
she
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
of
tenderness
how
can
she
be
in
such
haste
to
deprive
herself
of
the
solace
of
her
life
how
can
she
by
gross
acts
wound
that
delicacy
in
her
daughter
which
to
a
man
of
refinement
would
be
one
of
her
chief
attractions
and
which
will
be
lowered
in
his
esteem
by
the
suspicion
that
she
may
concur
in
the
indiscretion
of
the
mother
as
to
lucilla
added
she
stanley
and
i
sometimes
say
to
each
other
children
keep
yourselves
from
idols
o
my
dear
young
friend
it
is
in
vain
to
dissemble
her
unaffected
worth
and
sweetness
she
is
not
only
our
delightful
companion
but
our
confidential
friend
we
encourage
her
to
give
us
her
opinion
on
matters
of
business
as
well
as
of
taste
and
having
reflected
as
well
as
read
a
good
deal
she
is
not
destitute
of
materials
on
which
to
exercise
her
reasoning
powers
we
have
never
repressed
her
natural
vivacity
because
we
never
saw
it
like
ph
oe
be
in
danger
of
carrying
her
off
from
the
straight
line
i
thanked
stanley
for
her
affectionate
frankness
with
a
warmth
which
showed
the
cordial
interest
i
took
in
her
who
was
the
object
of
it
company
coming
in
interrupted
our
interesting
after
tea
i
observed
the
party
in
the
saloon
to
be
thinner
than
usual
sir
john
and
lady
belfield
having
withdrawn
to
write
letters
and
that
individual
having
quitted
the
room
whose
presence
would
have
reconciled
me
to
the
absence
of
all
the
rest
i
stole
out
to
take
a
solitary
walk
at
the
distance
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
on
a
little
common
i
observed
for
the
first
time
the
smallest
and
neatest
cottage
i
ever
beheld
there
was
a
flourishing
young
orchard
behind
it
and
a
little
court
full
of
flowers
in
front
but
i
was
particularly
attracted
by
a
beautiful
in
full
blossom
which
grew
against
the
house
and
almost
covered
the
clean
white
walls
as
i
knew
this
sort
of
rose
was
a
particular
favorite
of
lucilla
i
opened
the
low
wicket
which
led
into
the
little
court
and
i
looked
about
for
some
living
creature
of
whom
i
might
have
begged
the
flowers
but
seeing
no
one
i
ventured
to
gather
a
bunch
of
the
roses
and
the
door
being
open
walked
into
the
house
in
order
to
acknowledge
my
theft
and
make
my
compensation
in
vain
i
looked
round
the
little
neat
kitchen
no
one
appeared
i
was
just
going
out
when
the
sound
of
a
soft
female
voice
over
head
arrested
my
attention
impelled
by
a
curiosity
which
considering
the
rank
of
the
inhabitants
i
did
not
feel
it
necessary
to
resist
i
softly
stole
up
the
narrow
stairs
cautiously
stooping
as
i
ascended
the
lowness
of
the
ceiling
not
allowing
me
to
walk
upright
i
stood
still
at
the
door
of
a
little
chamber
which
was
left
half
open
to
admit
the
air
i
gently
put
my
head
through
what
were
my
emotions
when
i
saw
lucilla
stanley
kneeling
by
the
side
of
a
little
clean
bed
a
large
old
bible
spread
open
on
the
bed
before
her
out
of
which
she
was
reading
one
of
the
penitential
psalms
to
a
pale
emaciated
female
figure
who
lifted
up
her
failing
eyes
and
clasped
her
feeble
hands
in
solemn
attention
before
two
little
bars
which
served
for
a
grate
knelt
ph
oe
be
with
one
hand
stirring
some
broth
which
she
had
brought
from
home
and
with
the
other
fanning
with
her
straw
bonnet
the
dying
embers
in
order
to
make
the
broth
boil
yet
seemingly
attentive
to
her
sister
reading
her
disheveled
hair
the
deep
flush
which
the
fire
and
her
labor
of
love
gave
her
naturally
animated
countenance
formed
a
fine
contrast
to
the
angelic
tranquillity
and
calm
devotion
which
sat
on
the
face
of
lucilla
her
voice
was
inexpressibly
sweet
and
penetrating
while
faith
hope
and
charity
seemed
to
beam
from
her
fine
uplifted
eyes
on
account
of
the
closeness
of
the
room
she
had
thrown
off
her
hat
cloak
and
gloves
and
laid
them
on
the
bed
and
her
fine
hair
which
had
escaped
from
its
confinement
shaded
that
side
of
her
face
which
was
next
the
door
and
prevented
her
seeing
me
i
scarcely
dared
to
breathe
lest
i
should
interrupt
such
a
scene
it
was
a
subject
not
unworthy
of
raphael
she
next
began
to
read
the
psalm
with
the
meek
yet
solemn
emphasis
of
devout
feeling
blessed
is
he
that
considereth
the
poor
and
needy
the
lord
shall
deliver
him
in
the
time
of
trouble
neither
the
poor
woman
nor
myself
could
hold
out
any
longer
she
was
overcome
by
her
gratitude
and
i
by
my
admiration
and
we
both
at
the
same
moment
involuntarily
exclaimed
amen
i
sprang
forward
with
a
motion
which
i
could
no
longer
control
lucilla
saw
me
started
up
in
confusion
and
blushed
celestial
rosy
red
then
eagerly
endeavoring
to
conceal
the
bible
by
drawing
her
hat
over
it
ph
oe
be
said
she
with
all
the
composure
she
could
assume
is
the
broth
ready
ph
oe
be
with
her
usual
gayety
called
out
to
me
to
come
and
assist
which
i
did
but
so
unskillfully
that
she
chid
me
for
my
awkwardness
it
was
an
interesting
sight
to
see
one
of
the
blooming
sisters
lift
the
dying
woman
in
her
bed
and
support
her
with
her
arm
while
the
other
fed
her
her
own
weak
hand
being
unequal
to
the
task
at
that
moment
how
little
did
the
splendors
and
vanities
of
life
appear
in
my
eyes
and
how
ready
was
i
to
exclaim
with
wolsey
vain
pomp
and
glory
of
the
world
i
hate
you
when
they
had
finished
their
pious
office
i
inquired
if
the
poor
woman
had
no
attendant
ph
oe
be
who
was
generally
the
chief
speaker
said
she
has
a
good
daughter
who
is
out
at
work
by
day
but
takes
care
of
her
mother
at
night
but
she
is
never
left
alone
for
she
has
a
little
who
attends
her
in
the
mean
time
but
as
she
is
obliged
to
go
once
a
day
to
the
grove
to
fetch
provisions
we
generally
contrive
to
send
her
while
we
are
here
that
dame
alice
may
never
be
left
alone
while
we
were
talking
i
heard
a
little
weary
step
painfully
climbing
up
the
stairs
and
looked
round
expecting
to
see
the
but
it
was
little
kate
stanley
with
a
lap
full
of
dried
sticks
which
she
had
been
collecting
for
the
poor
woman
fire
the
sharp
points
of
the
sticks
had
forced
their
way
in
many
places
through
the
white
muslin
frock
part
of
which
together
with
her
bonnet
she
had
left
in
the
hedge
which
she
had
been
robbing
at
this
loss
she
expressed
not
much
concern
but
lamented
not
a
little
that
sticks
were
so
scarce
that
she
feared
the
broth
had
been
spoiled
from
her
being
so
long
in
picking
them
but
she
could
not
help
it
i
was
pleased
with
these
under
allotments
these
low
degrees
in
the
scale
of
charity
i
had
gently
laid
my
roses
on
the
hat
of
miss
stanley
as
it
lay
on
the
bible
and
before
we
left
the
room
as
i
drew
near
the
good
old
dame
to
slip
a
couple
of
guineas
into
her
hand
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
lucilla
who
thought
herself
unobserved
retire
to
the
little
window
and
fasten
the
roses
into
the
crown
of
her
hat
like
a
garland
when
the
returned
loaded
with
the
daily
bounty
from
the
grove
we
took
our
leave
followed
by
the
prayers
and
blessings
of
the
good
woman
as
we
passed
by
the
the
orchard
and
the
court
ph
oe
be
said
to
me
you
glad
that
poor
people
can
have
such
pleasures
i
told
her
it
doubled
my
gratification
to
witness
the
enjoyment
and
to
trace
the
hand
which
conferred
it
for
she
had
owned
it
was
work
we
have
always
replied
ph
oe
be
a
particular
satisfaction
in
observing
a
neat
little
about
a
cottage
because
it
holds
out
a
comfortable
indication
that
the
inhabitants
are
free
from
absolute
want
before
they
think
of
these
little
embellishments
it
looks
also
said
miss
stanley
as
if
the
woman
instead
of
spending
her
few
leisure
moments
in
gadding
abroad
employed
them
in
adorning
her
little
habitation
in
order
to
make
it
more
attractive
to
her
husband
and
we
know
more
than
one
instance
in
this
village
in
which
the
man
has
been
led
to
give
up
the
by
the
innocent
ambition
of
improving
on
her
labors
i
asked
her
what
first
inspired
her
with
such
fondness
for
gardening
and
how
she
had
acquired
so
much
skill
and
taste
in
this
elegant
art
she
blushed
and
said
she
was
afraid
i
should
think
her
romantic
if
she
were
to
confess
that
she
had
caught
both
the
taste
and
the
passion
as
far
as
she
possessed
either
from
an
early
and
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
paradise
lost
of
which
she
considered
the
beautiful
descriptions
of
scenery
and
plantations
as
the
best
precepts
for
landscape
gardening
milton
she
said
both
excited
the
taste
and
supplied
the
rules
he
taught
the
art
and
inspired
the
love
of
it
from
the
gardens
of
paradise
the
transition
was
easy
and
natural
on
my
asking
her
opinion
of
this
portrait
as
drawn
by
milton
she
replied
that
she
considered
eve
in
her
state
of
innocence
as
the
most
beautiful
model
of
the
delicacy
propriety
grace
and
elegance
of
the
female
character
which
any
poet
ever
exhibited
even
after
her
fall
added
she
there
is
something
wonderfully
touching
in
her
remorse
and
affecting
in
her
contrition
we
are
probably
replied
i
more
deeply
affected
with
the
beautifully
contrite
expressions
of
repentance
in
our
first
parents
from
being
so
deeply
involved
in
the
consequences
of
the
offense
which
occasioned
it
and
yet
replied
she
i
am
a
little
affronted
with
the
poet
that
while
with
a
noble
justness
he
represents
adam
grief
at
his
expulsion
as
chiefly
arising
from
his
being
banished
from
the
presence
of
his
maker
the
sorrows
of
eve
seem
too
much
to
arise
from
being
banished
from
her
flowers
the
grief
though
never
grief
was
so
beautifully
eloquent
is
rather
too
exquisite
her
substantial
ground
for
lamentation
considered
seeing
me
going
to
speak
she
stopped
me
with
a
smile
saying
i
see
by
your
looks
that
you
are
going
with
addison
to
vindicate
the
poet
and
to
call
this
a
just
appropriation
of
the
sentiment
to
the
sex
but
surely
the
disproportion
in
the
feeling
here
is
rather
too
violent
though
i
own
the
loss
of
her
flowers
have
aggravated
any
common
privation
there
is
however
no
female
character
in
the
whole
compass
of
poetry
in
which
i
have
ever
taken
so
lively
an
interest
and
no
poem
that
ever
took
such
powerful
possession
of
my
mind
if
any
thing
had
been
wanting
to
my
full
assurance
of
the
sympathy
of
our
tastes
and
feelings
this
would
have
completed
my
conviction
it
struck
me
as
the
virgilian
lots
formerly
struck
the
superstitious
our
mutual
admiration
of
the
paradise
lost
and
of
its
heroine
seemed
to
bring
us
nearer
together
than
we
had
yet
been
her
remarks
which
i
gradually
drew
from
her
in
the
course
of
our
walk
on
the
construction
of
the
fable
the
richness
of
the
imagery
the
elevation
of
the
language
the
sublimity
and
just
appropriation
of
the
sentiments
the
artful
structure
of
the
verse
and
the
variety
of
the
characters
convinced
me
that
she
had
imbibed
her
taste
from
the
purest
sources
it
was
easy
to
trace
her
knowledge
of
the
best
authors
though
she
quoted
none
this
said
i
exultingly
to
myself
is
the
true
learning
for
a
lady
a
knowledge
that
is
rather
detected
than
displayed
that
is
felt
in
its
effects
on
her
mind
and
conversation
that
is
seen
not
by
her
citing
learned
names
or
adducing
long
quotations
but
in
the
general
result
by
the
delicacy
of
her
taste
and
the
correctness
of
her
sentiments
in
our
way
home
i
made
a
merit
with
little
kate
not
only
by
rescuing
her
hat
from
the
hedge
but
by
making
a
little
provision
of
wood
under
it
of
larger
sticks
than
she
could
gather
which
she
joyfully
promised
to
assist
the
in
carrying
to
the
cottage
i
ventured
with
as
much
diffidence
as
if
i
had
been
soliciting
a
pension
for
myself
to
entreat
that
i
might
be
permitted
to
undertake
the
putting
forward
dame
alice
little
girl
in
the
world
as
soon
as
she
should
be
released
from
her
attendance
on
her
grandmother
my
proposal
was
graciously
accepted
on
condition
that
it
met
with
and
stanley
approbation
when
we
joined
the
party
at
supper
it
was
delightful
to
observe
that
the
habits
of
religious
charity
were
so
interwoven
with
the
texture
of
these
girl
minds
that
the
evening
which
had
been
so
interesting
to
me
was
to
them
only
a
common
evening
marked
with
nothing
particular
it
never
occurred
to
them
to
allude
to
it
and
once
or
twice
when
i
was
tempted
to
mention
it
my
imprudence
was
repressed
by
a
look
of
the
most
significant
gravity
from
lucilla
i
was
comforted
however
by
observing
that
my
roses
were
transferred
from
the
hat
to
the
hair
this
did
not
escape
the
penetrating
eye
of
ph
oe
be
who
archly
said
i
wonder
lucilla
what
particular
charm
there
is
in
dame
alice
faded
roses
i
offered
you
some
fresh
ones
since
we
came
home
i
never
knew
you
prefer
withered
flowers
before
lucilla
made
no
answer
but
cast
down
her
timid
eyes
and
the
roses
on
her
head
chapter
xli
after
breakfast
next
morning
the
company
dropped
off
one
after
another
except
lady
belfield
miss
stanley
and
myself
we
had
been
so
busily
engaged
in
looking
over
the
plan
of
a
conservatory
which
sir
john
proposed
to
build
at
beechwood
his
estate
in
surrey
that
we
hardly
missed
them
little
celia
whom
i
call
the
rosebud
had
climbed
up
my
knees
a
favorite
station
with
her
and
was
begging
me
to
tell
her
another
pretty
story
i
had
before
told
her
so
many
that
i
had
exhausted
both
my
memory
and
my
imagination
lucilla
was
smiling
at
my
impoverished
invention
when
lady
belfield
was
called
out
of
the
room
her
fair
friend
rose
mechanically
to
follow
her
her
ladyship
begged
her
not
to
stir
but
to
employ
the
five
minutes
of
her
absence
in
carefully
criticising
the
plan
she
held
in
her
hand
saying
she
would
bring
back
another
which
sir
john
had
by
him
and
that
lucilla
who
is
considered
as
the
last
appeal
in
all
matters
of
this
nature
should
decide
to
which
the
preference
should
be
given
before
the
architect
went
to
work
in
a
moment
i
forgot
my
tale
and
my
rosebud
and
the
conservatory
and
every
thing
but
lucilla
whom
i
was
beginning
to
address
when
little
celia
pulling
my
coat
said
oh
charles
for
so
i
teach
all
the
little
ones
to
call
me
comfit
tells
me
very
bad
news
she
says
that
your
new
curricle
is
come
down
and
that
you
are
going
to
run
away
oh
do
go
i
ca
part
with
you
said
the
little
charmer
throwing
her
arms
round
my
neck
will
you
go
with
me
celia
said
i
kissing
her
rosy
cheek
there
will
be
room
enough
in
the
curricle
oh
i
should
like
to
go
said
she
if
lucilla
may
go
with
us
do
dear
charles
do
let
lucilla
go
to
the
priory
she
will
be
very
good
wo
you
lucilla
i
ventured
to
look
at
miss
stanley
who
tried
to
laugh
without
succeeding
and
blushed
without
trying
at
it
on
my
making
no
reply
for
fear
of
adding
to
her
confusion
celia
looked
up
piteously
in
my
face
and
cried
and
so
you
wo
let
lucilla
go
home
with
you
i
am
sure
the
curricle
will
hold
us
all
nicely
for
i
am
very
little
and
lucilla
is
not
very
big
will
persuade
her
celia
said
i
o
said
she
she
does
not
want
persuading
she
is
willing
enough
and
i
will
run
to
papa
and
mamma
and
ask
their
leave
and
then
lucilla
will
go
and
glad
wo
you
lucilla
so
saying
she
sprang
out
of
my
arms
and
ran
out
of
the
room
lucilla
would
have
followed
and
prevented
her
i
respectfully
detained
her
how
could
i
neglect
such
an
opportunity
such
an
opening
as
the
sweet
prattler
had
given
me
it
was
impossible
to
overlook
the
impulse
was
too
powerful
to
be
resisted
i
gently
replaced
her
on
her
seat
and
in
language
which
if
it
did
any
justice
to
my
feelings
was
the
most
ardent
tender
and
respectful
poured
out
my
whole
heart
i
believe
my
words
were
incoherent
i
am
sure
they
were
sincere
she
was
evidently
distressed
her
emotion
prevented
her
replying
but
it
was
the
emotion
of
surprise
not
of
resentment
her
confusion
bore
no
symptoms
of
displeasure
blushing
and
hesitating
she
at
last
said
my
father
sir
my
mother
here
her
voice
failed
her
i
recollected
with
joy
that
on
the
application
of
lord
staunton
she
had
allowed
of
no
such
reference
nay
she
had
forbidden
it
i
take
your
reference
joyfully
said
i
only
tell
me
that
if
i
am
so
happy
as
to
obtain
their
consent
you
will
not
withhold
yours
she
ventured
to
raise
her
timid
eyes
to
mine
and
her
modest
but
expressive
look
encouraged
me
almost
as
much
as
any
words
could
have
done
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
in
came
sir
john
with
the
other
drawing
of
the
conservatory
in
his
hand
after
having
examined
us
both
with
his
keen
critical
eye
well
miss
stanley
said
he
with
a
look
and
tone
which
had
more
meaning
than
she
could
well
stand
here
is
the
other
drawing
as
you
look
as
if
you
had
been
examining
the
first
you
will
now
give
me
your
opinion
of
the
merits
of
both
he
had
the
cruelty
to
lay
so
much
stress
on
the
words
cool
calm
and
deliberate
and
to
pronounce
them
in
so
arch
a
manner
and
so
ironical
a
tone
as
clearly
showed
he
read
in
her
countenance
that
no
epithets
could
possibly
have
been
so
ill
applied
lady
belfield
came
in
immediately
after
well
caroline
said
he
with
a
significant
glance
miss
stanley
has
deeply
considered
the
subject
since
you
went
i
never
saw
her
look
more
interested
about
any
thing
i
do
think
she
is
dissatisfied
on
the
whole
general
approbation
is
all
she
now
expresses
she
will
have
time
to
spy
out
faults
hereafter
she
sees
none
at
present
all
is
beauty
grace
and
proportion
as
if
this
was
not
enough
in
ran
celia
quite
out
of
breath
oh
lucilla
cried
she
papa
and
mamma
wo
let
you
go
with
charles
though
i
told
them
you
begged
and
prayed
to
go
lucilla
the
pink
of
whose
cheeks
was
become
crimson
said
angrily
how
celia
what
do
you
mean
oh
no
replied
the
child
i
mean
to
say
that
begged
and
prayed
and
i
thought
you
looked
as
if
you
would
like
to
go
though
charles
did
not
ask
you
and
so
i
told
papa
this
was
too
much
the
belfields
laughed
outright
but
lady
belfield
had
the
charity
to
take
lucilla
hand
saying
come
into
my
my
dear
and
let
us
settle
this
conservatory
business
this
prattling
child
will
never
let
us
get
on
miss
stanley
followed
her
face
glowing
with
impatience
celia
whom
i
detained
called
after
her
papa
only
said
there
was
not
room
in
the
curricle
for
three
but
if
it
is
only
a
little
way
i
am
sure
we
could
sit
could
we
not
lucilla
lucilla
was
now
happily
out
of
hearing
though
i
was
hurt
that
her
delicacy
had
suffered
so
much
yet
i
own
i
hugged
the
little
innocent
author
of
this
confusion
with
additional
fondness
sir
john
raillery
now
that
lucilla
could
be
no
longer
pained
by
it
was
cordially
received
or
rather
i
was
inattentive
to
every
object
but
the
one
of
which
my
heart
was
full
to
be
heard
to
be
accepted
though
tacitly
to
be
referred
to
parents
who
i
knew
had
no
will
but
hers
was
such
a
sacred
and
homefelt
delight
such
sober
certainty
of
waking
bliss
as
i
felt
till
now
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
i
found
no
opportunity
of
speaking
to
stanley
always
frank
and
cheerful
he
neither
avoided
nor
sought
me
but
the
arrival
of
company
prevented
our
being
thrown
together
lucilla
appeared
at
dinner
as
usual
a
little
graver
and
more
silent
but
always
unaffected
natural
and
delicate
sir
john
whispered
to
me
that
she
had
entreated
her
mother
to
keep
celia
out
of
the
way
till
this
curricle
business
was
a
little
got
out
of
her
head
chapter
xlii
the
next
morning
as
soon
as
i
thought
stanley
had
retreated
to
his
library
i
followed
him
thither
he
was
busy
writing
letters
i
apologized
for
my
intrusion
he
laid
his
papers
aside
and
invited
me
to
sit
by
him
you
are
too
good
sir
said
i
to
receive
with
so
much
kindness
a
culprit
who
appears
before
you
ingenuously
to
acknowledge
the
infraction
of
a
treaty
into
which
he
had
the
honor
of
entering
with
you
i
fear
that
a
few
days
are
wanting
of
my
prescribed
month
i
had
resolved
to
obey
you
with
the
most
religious
scrupulousness
but
a
circumstance
trifling
in
itself
has
led
almost
irresistibly
to
a
declaration
which
in
obedience
to
your
command
i
had
resolved
to
postpone
but
though
it
is
somewhat
premature
i
hope
however
you
will
not
condemn
my
precipitancy
i
have
ventured
to
tell
your
charming
daughter
how
necessary
she
is
to
my
happiness
she
does
not
reject
me
she
refers
me
to
her
father
you
have
your
peace
to
make
with
my
daughter
i
can
tell
you
sir
said
stanley
looking
gravely
i
fear
you
have
mortally
offended
her
i
was
dreadfully
alarmed
you
know
not
how
you
afflict
me
sir
said
i
how
have
i
offended
miss
stanley
not
miss
stanley
said
he
smiling
but
miss
celia
stanley
who
extremely
resents
having
been
banished
from
the
yesterday
evening
if
celia
displeasure
is
all
i
have
to
fear
sir
i
am
most
fortunate
oh
sir
my
happiness
the
peace
of
my
future
life
is
in
your
hands
but
first
tell
me
you
forgive
the
violation
of
my
promise
i
am
willing
to
believe
charles
replied
he
that
you
kept
the
spirit
of
your
engagement
though
you
broke
it
in
the
letter
and
for
an
unpremeditated
breach
of
an
obligation
of
this
nature
we
must
not
i
believe
be
too
rigorous
your
conduct
since
your
declaration
to
me
has
confirmed
the
affection
which
your
character
had
before
excited
you
were
probably
surprised
and
hurt
at
my
cold
reception
of
your
proposal
a
proposal
which
gave
me
a
deeper
satisfaction
than
i
can
express
yet
i
was
no
dissembler
in
suppressing
the
pleasure
i
felt
at
an
address
so
every
way
desirable
my
dear
charles
i
know
a
little
of
human
nature
i
know
how
susceptible
the
youthful
heart
is
of
impressions
i
know
how
apt
these
impressions
are
to
be
obliterated
a
new
face
a
more
advantageous
connection
hold
sir
said
i
indignantly
interrupting
him
you
can
not
think
so
meanly
of
me
you
can
not
rate
the
son
of
your
friend
so
low
i
am
very
far
indeed
replied
he
from
rating
you
low
i
know
you
abhor
mercenary
considerations
but
i
know
also
that
you
are
a
young
man
lively
ardent
impressible
i
know
the
rapid
effect
that
leisure
retirement
rural
scenes
daily
opportunities
of
seeing
a
young
woman
not
ugly
of
conversing
with
a
young
woman
not
disagreeable
may
produce
on
the
heart
or
rather
on
the
imagination
i
was
aware
that
seeing
no
other
conversing
with
no
other
none
at
least
that
to
speak
honestly
i
could
consider
as
a
fair
competitor
hardly
left
you
an
unprejudiced
judge
of
the
state
of
your
own
heart
i
was
not
sure
but
that
this
sort
of
easy
commerce
might
produce
a
feeling
of
complacency
which
might
be
mistaken
for
love
i
could
not
consent
that
mere
accident
mere
leisure
the
mere
circumstance
of
being
thrown
together
should
irrevocably
entangle
either
of
you
i
was
desirous
of
affording
you
time
to
see
to
know
and
to
judge
i
would
not
take
advantage
of
your
first
emotions
i
would
not
take
advantage
of
your
friendship
for
me
i
would
not
take
advantage
of
your
feeling
ardently
till
i
had
given
you
time
to
judge
temperately
and
fairly
i
assured
him
i
was
equally
at
a
loss
to
express
my
gratitude
for
his
kindness
and
my
veneration
of
his
wisdom
and
thanked
him
in
terms
of
affectionate
energy
my
regard
for
you
said
he
is
not
of
yesterday
i
have
taken
a
warm
interest
in
your
character
and
happiness
almost
ever
since
you
have
been
in
being
and
in
a
way
more
intimate
and
personal
than
you
can
suspect
so
saying
he
arose
unlocked
the
drawer
of
a
cabinet
which
stood
behind
him
and
took
out
a
large
packet
of
letters
he
then
resumed
his
seat
and
holding
out
the
direction
on
the
covers
asked
me
if
i
was
acquainted
with
the
a
tear
involuntarily
started
into
my
eye
as
i
exclaimed
it
is
the
hand
of
my
beloved
father
listen
to
me
attentively
resumed
he
you
are
not
ignorant
that
never
were
two
men
more
firmly
attached
by
all
the
ties
which
ever
cemented
a
christian
friendship
than
your
lamented
father
and
myself
our
early
youth
was
spent
in
the
same
studies
the
same
pleasures
the
same
society
took
sweet
counsel
together
and
went
to
the
house
of
god
as
friends
he
condescendingly
overlooked
my
being
five
or
six
years
younger
than
himself
after
his
marriage
with
your
excellent
mother
the
current
of
life
carried
us
different
ways
but
without
causing
any
abatement
in
the
warmth
of
our
attachment
i
continued
to
spend
one
month
every
year
with
him
at
the
priory
till
i
myself
married
you
were
then
not
more
than
three
or
four
years
old
and
your
engaging
manners
and
sweet
temper
laid
the
foundation
of
an
affection
which
has
not
been
diminished
by
time
and
the
reports
of
your
progress
sedentary
habits
on
the
part
of
your
father
and
a
rapidly
increasing
family
on
mine
kept
us
stationary
at
the
two
extremities
of
the
kingdom
i
settled
at
the
grove
and
both
as
husband
and
father
have
been
happiest
of
the
happy
as
soon
as
lucilla
was
born
your
father
and
i
simultaneously
formed
a
wish
that
it
might
be
possible
to
perpetuate
our
friendship
by
the
future
union
of
our
children
when
stanley
uttered
these
words
my
heart
beat
so
fast
and
the
agitation
of
my
whole
frame
was
so
visible
that
he
paused
for
a
moment
but
perceiving
that
i
was
all
ear
and
that
i
made
a
silent
motion
for
him
to
proceed
he
went
on
this
was
a
favorite
project
with
us
we
pursued
it
however
with
the
moderation
of
men
who
had
a
settled
sense
of
the
uncertainty
of
all
human
things
of
human
life
itself
and
with
a
strong
conviction
of
the
probability
that
our
project
might
never
be
realized
without
too
much
indulging
the
illusions
of
hope
we
agreed
that
there
could
be
no
harm
in
educating
our
children
for
each
other
in
inspiring
them
with
corresponding
tastes
similar
inclinations
and
especially
with
an
exact
conformity
in
their
religious
views
we
never
indulged
the
presumptuous
thought
of
counteracting
providential
dispensations
of
conquering
difficulties
which
time
might
prove
to
be
inseparable
and
above
all
we
determined
never
to
be
so
weak
or
so
unjust
as
to
think
of
compelling
their
affections
we
had
both
studied
the
human
heart
long
enough
to
know
that
it
is
a
perverse
and
wayward
thing
we
were
convinced
that
it
would
not
be
dictated
to
in
a
matter
which
involved
its
dearest
interests
we
knew
that
it
liked
to
pick
out
its
own
happiness
in
its
own
way
as
stanley
proceeded
my
heart
melted
with
grateful
love
for
a
father
who
in
making
such
a
provision
for
my
happiness
had
generously
left
my
choice
so
free
but
while
my
conscience
seemed
to
reproach
me
as
if
i
had
not
deserved
such
tenderness
i
rejoiced
that
my
memory
had
no
specific
charge
to
bring
against
it
for
all
these
reasons
continued
stanley
we
mutually
agreed
to
bury
our
wishes
in
our
own
bosoms
to
commit
the
event
to
him
by
whom
all
events
are
governed
never
to
name
you
to
each
other
but
in
a
general
way
to
excite
no
fictitious
liking
to
elicit
no
artificial
passion
and
to
kindle
neither
impatience
curiosity
nor
interest
nothing
more
than
a
friendly
family
regard
was
ever
manifested
and
the
names
of
charles
and
lucilla
were
never
mentioned
together
in
this
you
have
found
your
advantage
had
my
daughter
been
accustomed
to
hear
you
spoken
of
with
any
particularity
had
she
been
conscious
that
any
important
consequences
might
have
attached
to
your
visit
you
would
have
lost
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
in
her
native
simplicity
of
character
undesigning
and
artless
i
trust
she
would
have
been
under
any
circumstances
but
to
have
been
unreserved
and
open
would
have
been
scarcely
possible
nor
might
you
my
dear
charles
with
your
strong
sense
of
filial
piety
have
been
able
exactly
to
discriminate
how
much
of
your
attachment
was
choice
how
much
was
duty
the
awkwardness
of
restraint
would
have
diminished
the
pleasure
of
intercourse
to
both
knowing
that
the
childish
brother
and
sister
sort
of
intimacy
was
not
the
most
promising
mode
for
the
development
of
your
mutual
sentiments
we
agreed
that
you
should
not
meet
till
within
a
year
or
two
of
the
period
when
it
would
be
proper
that
the
union
if
ever
might
take
place
we
were
neither
of
us
of
an
age
or
character
to
indulge
very
romantic
ideas
of
the
doctrine
of
sympathies
still
we
saw
no
reason
for
excluding
such
a
possibility
if
we
succeeded
we
knew
that
we
were
training
two
beings
in
a
conformity
of
christian
principles
which
if
they
did
not
at
once
attract
affection
would
not
fail
to
insure
it
should
inferior
motives
first
influence
your
mutual
liking
and
if
it
failed
we
should
each
have
educated
a
christian
who
would
be
likely
to
carry
piety
and
virtue
into
two
other
families
much
good
would
attend
our
success
and
no
possible
evil
could
attend
our
failure
i
could
show
you
i
believe
near
a
hundred
letters
on
each
side
of
which
you
were
the
unconscious
subject
your
father
in
his
last
illness
returned
all
mine
to
prevent
a
premature
discovery
knowing
how
soon
his
papers
would
fall
into
your
hands
if
it
will
give
you
pleasure
you
may
peruse
a
correspondence
of
which
for
almost
twenty
years
you
were
the
little
hero
in
reading
my
letters
you
will
make
yourself
master
of
the
character
of
lucilla
you
will
read
the
history
of
her
mind
you
will
mark
the
unfolding
of
her
faculties
and
the
progress
of
her
education
in
those
of
your
father
you
will
not
be
sorry
to
trace
back
your
own
steps
here
stanley
making
a
pause
i
bowed
my
grateful
acceptance
of
his
obliging
offer
i
was
afraid
to
speak
i
was
almost
afraid
to
breathe
lest
i
should
lose
a
word
of
a
communication
so
interesting
you
now
see
resumed
stanley
why
you
were
sent
to
edinburg
cambridge
and
oxford
were
too
near
london
and
of
course
too
near
hampshire
to
have
maintained
the
necessary
separation
as
soon
as
you
left
the
university
your
father
proposed
accompanying
you
on
a
visit
to
the
grove
like
fond
parents
we
had
prepared
each
other
to
expect
to
see
a
being
just
such
a
one
as
each
would
have
wished
for
the
companion
of
his
child
this
was
to
be
merely
a
visit
of
experiment
you
were
both
too
young
to
marry
but
we
were
impatient
to
place
you
both
in
a
post
of
observation
to
see
the
result
of
a
meeting
to
mark
what
sympathy
there
would
be
between
two
minds
formed
with
a
view
to
each
other
but
vain
are
all
the
projects
of
man
blindness
to
the
future
you
doubtless
remember
that
just
as
every
thing
was
prepared
for
your
journey
southward
your
dear
father
was
seized
with
the
lingering
illness
of
which
he
died
till
almost
the
last
he
was
able
to
write
me
in
his
intervals
of
ease
short
letters
on
the
favorite
topic
i
remember
with
what
joy
his
heart
dilated
when
he
told
me
of
your
positive
refusal
to
leave
him
on
his
pressing
you
to
pursue
the
plan
already
settled
and
to
make
your
visit
to
london
and
the
grove
without
him
i
will
read
you
a
passage
from
his
letter
he
read
as
follows
in
vain
have
i
endeavored
to
drive
this
dear
son
for
a
short
time
from
me
he
asked
with
the
indignant
feeling
of
affronted
filial
piety
if
i
could
propose
to
him
any
compensation
for
my
absence
from
his
sick
couch
make
no
sacrifice
to
duty
said
he
preferring
you
if
i
make
any
sacrifice
it
is
to
pleasure
seeing
my
eyes
overflow
with
grateful
tenderness
stanley
said
if
i
can
find
his
last
letter
i
will
show
it
you
then
looking
over
the
packet
here
it
is
said
he
putting
it
into
my
hands
with
visible
emotion
neither
of
us
had
strength
of
voice
to
be
able
to
read
it
aloud
it
was
written
at
several
times
priory
wednesday
stanley
i
feel
that
i
am
dying
death
is
awful
my
dear
friend
but
it
is
neither
surprising
nor
terrible
i
have
been
too
long
accustomed
steadily
to
contemplate
it
at
a
distance
to
start
from
it
now
it
is
near
as
a
man
i
have
feared
death
as
a
christian
i
trust
i
have
overcome
this
fear
why
should
i
dread
that
which
mere
reason
taught
me
is
not
an
extinction
of
my
being
and
which
revelation
has
convinced
me
will
be
an
improvement
of
it
an
improvement
oh
how
inconceivable
for
several
years
i
have
habituated
myself
every
day
to
reflect
for
some
moments
on
the
vanity
of
life
the
certainty
of
death
the
awfulness
of
judgment
and
the
duration
of
eternity
the
separation
from
my
excellent
wife
is
a
trial
from
which
i
should
utterly
shrink
were
i
not
sustained
by
the
christian
hope
when
we
married
we
knew
that
we
were
not
immortal
i
have
endeavored
to
familiarize
to
her
and
to
myself
the
inevitable
separation
by
constantly
keeping
up
in
the
minds
of
both
the
idea
that
one
of
us
be
the
survivor
i
have
endeavored
to
make
that
idea
supportable
by
the
conviction
that
the
survivorship
will
be
short
the
certain
speedy
eternal
o
etc
how
gloriously
does
christianity
exalt
the
rapture
by
ennobling
the
objects
of
this
sublime
apostrophe

friday
the
as
to
the
union
of
my
son
with
lucilla
you
and
i
my
friend
have
long
learned
from
an
authority
higher
than
that
classical
one
of
which
we
have
frequently
admired
the
expression
and
lamented
the
application
that
long
views
and
remote
hopes
and
distant
expectations
become
not
so
so
a
creature
as
man
i
trust
however
that
our
plans
have
been
carried
on
with
a
complete
conviction
of
this
brevity
with
an
entire
acquiescence
in
the
will
of
the
great
arbiter
of
life
and
death
i
have
told
charles
it
is
my
wish
that
he
should
visit
you
soon
after
my
death
i
durst
not
command
it
for
this
incomparable
youth
who
has
sacrificed
so
much
to
his
father
will
find
he
has
a
mother
worthy
of
still
greater
sacrifices
as
soon
as
he
can
prevail
on
himself
to
leave
her
you
will
see
him
may
he
and
your
lucilla
behold
each
other
with
the
eyes
with
which
each
of
us
views
his
own
child
if
they
see
each
other
with
indifference
never
let
them
know
our
wishes
it
would
perplex
and
hamper
those
to
whom
we
wish
perfect
freedom
of
thought
and
action
if
they
conceive
a
mutual
attachment
reveal
our
project
in
such
minds
it
will
strengthen
that
attachment
the
approbation
of
a
living
and
the
desire
of
a
deceased
parent
will
sanctify
their
union

must
break
off

horace
in
speaking
of
the
brevity
and
uncertainty
of
life
seldom
fails
to
produce
it
as

sensual
indulgence

the
fourth

i
resume
my
pen
which
i
thought
i
had
held
for
the
last

may
god
bless

direct
our
children
infinite
wisdom
permits
me
not
to
see
their
union
indeed
my
interest
in
all
earthly
things
weakens
even
my
solicitude
for
this
event
is
somewhat
diminished
the
most
important
circumstance
if
it
have
not
god
for
its
object
now
seems
comparatively
little
the
longest
life
with
all
its
concerns
shrinks
to
a
point
in
the
sight
of
a
dying
man
whose
eye
is
filled
by
eternity
eternity
oh
my
friend
eternity
is
a
depth
which
no
geometry
can
measure
no
arithmetic
calculate
no
imagination
conceive
no
rhetoric
describe
the
eye
of
a
dying
christian
seems
gifted
to
penetrate
depths
hid
from
the
wisdom
of
philosophy
it
looks
athwart
the
dark
valley
without
dismay
cheered
by
the
bright
scene
beyond
it
it
looks
with
a
kind
of
chastised
impatience
to
that
land
where
happiness
will
be
only
holiness
perfected
there
all
the
promises
of
the
gospel
will
be
accomplished
there
afflicted
virtue
will
rejoice
at
its
past
trials
and
acknowledge
their
subservience
to
its
present
bliss
the
secret
of
the
righteous
shall
be
recognized
and
rewarded
and
all
the
hopes
of
the
christian
shall
have
their
complete
consummation
saturday
my
weakness
increases
i
have
written
this
at
many
intervals
my
body
faints
but
in
the
lord
jehovah
is
everlasting
strength
oh
stanley
if
pain
is
trying
if
death
is
awful
to
him
who
knows
in

how
is

endured
how
is
death
encountered
by
those

have
no
such

tuesday

am
better

i
experience
little
of
that
rapture
which
some
require
as
the
sign
of
their
acceptance
i
yet
have
a
good
hope
through
grace
nay
there
are
moments
when
i
rejoice
with
joy
unspeakable
i
would
not
produce
this
joy
as
any
certain
criterion
of
my
safety
because
from
the
nature
of
my
disease
there
are
also
moments
when
my
spirits
sink
and
this
might
equally
furnish
arguments
against
my
state
to
those
who
decide
by
frames
and
feelings
i
think
my

as
sound
my
pardon

these

are

stanley
my
departure
is
at

my
eternal
redemption
draweth

my
hope
is
full
of
immortality
this
is
my
comfort
not
that
my
sins
are
few
or
small
but
that
they
are
i
humbly
trust
pardoned
through
him
who
loved
me
and
gave
himself
for
me

he
that
has
promised
and
his
promises
are
not

adieu
on
the
cover
was
written
in
stanley
hand
he
died
three
days
after
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
mingled
and
conflicting
emotions
of
my
soul
while
i
perused
this
letter
gratitude
that
i
had
possessed
such
a
father
sorrow
that
i
had
lost
him
transport
in
anticipating
an
event
which
had
been
his
earnest
wish
for
almost
twenty
years
regret
that
he
was
not
permitted
to
witness
it
devout
joy
that
he
was
in
a
state
so
superior
to
even
sense
of
happiness
a
strong
feeling
of
the
uncertainty
and
brevity
of
happiness
a
solemn
resolution
that
i
would
never
act
unworthy
of
such
a
father
a
fervent
prayer
that
i
might
be
enabled
to
keep
that
resolution
all
these
emotions
so
agitated
and
divided
my
whole
mind
as
to
render
me
unfit
for
any
society
even
for
that
of
lucilla
i
withdrew
gratefully
pressing
stanley
hand
he
kindly
returned
the
pressure
but
neither
of
us
attempted
to
speak
he
silently
put
my
father
packet
into
my
hands
i
shut
myself
into
my
apartment
and
read
for
three
hours
letters
for
which
i
hope
to
be
the
better
in
time
and
in
eternity
i
found
in
them
a
treasure
of
religious
wisdom
excellent
maxims
of
human
prudence
a
thorough
acquaintance
with
life
and
manners
a
keen
insight
into
human
nature
in
the
abstract
and
a
nice
discrimination
of
individual
characters
admirable
documents
of
general
education
the
application
of
those
documents
to
my
particular
turn
of
character
and
diversified
methods
for
improving
it
the
pure
delight
to
which
i
looked
forward
in
reading
these
letters
with
lucilla
soon
became
my
predominant
feeling
i
returned
to
the
company
with
a
sense
of
felicity
which
the
above
feelings
and
reflections
had
composed
into
a
soothing
tranquillity
my
joy
was
sobered
without
being
abated
i
received
the
cordial
congratulations
of
my
friends
stanley
behaved
to
me
with
increased
affection
she
presented
me
to
her
daughter
with
whom
i
afterward
passed
two
hours
this
interview
left
me
nothing
to
desire
but
that
my
gratitude
to
the
almighty
dispenser
of
happiness
might
bear
some
little
proportion
to
his
blessings
as
i
was
passing
through
the
hall
after
dinner
i
spied
little
celia
peeping
out
of
the
door
of
the
children
apartment
in
hope
of
seeing
me
pass
she
flew
to
me
and
begged
i
would
take
her
in
to
the
company
as
i
knew
the
interdict
was
taken
off
i
carried
her
into
the
saloon
where
they
were
sitting
she
ran
into
lucilla
arms
and
said
in
a
voice
which
she
meant
for
a
whisper
but
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
the
whole
company
do
dear
lucilla
forgive
me
i
will
never
say
another
word
about
the
curricle
and
you
go
to
the
priory
since
you
do
like
it
lucilla
found
means
to
silence
her
by
showing
her
the
pictures
in
the
peacock
at
home
and
without
looking
up
to
observe
the
general
smile
contrived
to
attract
the
sweet
child
attention
to
this
beautiful
little
poem
in
spite
of
sir
john
who
did
his
utmost
to
widen
the
mischief
chapter
xliii
the
next
day
in
the
afternoon
barlow
called
on
us
by
the
uncommon
seriousness
of
his
countenance
i
saw
something
was
the
matter
you
will
be
shocked
said
he
to
hear
that
tyrrel
is
dying
if
not
actually
dead
he
was
the
night
before
last
seized
with
a
paralytic
stroke
he
lay
a
long
time
without
sense
or
motion
a
delirium
followed
in
a
short
interval
of
reason
he
sent
earnestly
imploring
to
see
me
seldom
have
i
witnessed
so
distressing
a
scene
as
i
entered
the
room
he
fixed
his
glassy
eyes
full
upon
me
quite
unconscious
who
i
was
and
groaned
out
in
an
inward
hollow
voice
to
now
ye
rich
men
weep
and
howl
for
your
miseries
are
come
upon
you
i
asked
how
he
did
he
replied
still
from
james
why
my
gold
and
silver
are
cankered
the
rust
of
them
shall
witness
against
me
they
eat
up
my
flesh
as
it
were
fire
i
was
astonished
continued
barlow
to
see
so
exact
a
memory
coupled
with
so
wild
an
imagination
composed
sir
said
i
seeing
he
began
to
recollect
me
deep
contrition
is
a
favorable
symptom
barlow
replied
he
grasping
my
hand
with
a
vehemence
which
corresponded
with
his
look
you
never
heard
of
riches
kept
by
the
owner
thereof
to
his
hurt
restitution
doctor
restitution
and
it
must
be
immediate
or
it
will
be
too
late
i
was
now
deeply
alarmed
sir
said
i
are
not
unhappily
driven
to
adopt
james
next
words
forgive
me
but
you
can
not
surely
have
defrauded
no
no
cried
he
have
been
what
the
world
calls
honest
but
not
what
the
judge
of
quick
and
dead
will
call
so
the
restitution
i
must
make
is
not
to
the
rich
for
any
thing
i
have
from
them
but
to
the
poor
for
what
i
have
from
them
hardness
of
heart
would
have
been
but
a
common
sin
in
a
common
man
but
i
have
been
a
professor
doctor
i
will
not
say
a
hypocrite
for
i
deceived
myself
as
much
as
others
but
oh
how
hollow
has
my
profession
been
here
seeing
him
ready
to
faint
continued
barlow
i
imposed
silence
on
him
till
he
had
taken
a
cordial
this
revived
him
and
he
went
on
was
miserable
in
my
early
course
of
profligacy
i
was
disappointed
in
my
subsequent
schemes
of
ambition
i
expected
more
from
the
world
than
it
had
to
give
but
i
continued
to
love
it
with
all
its
disappointments
under
whatever
new
shape
it
presented
its
temptations
it
was
still
my
idol
i
had
always
loved
money
but
other
passions
more
turbulent
had
been
hitherto
predominant
these
i
at
length
renounced
covetousness
now
became
my
reigning
sin
still
it
was
to
the
broken
cistern
that
i
cleaved
still
it
was
on
the
broken
reed
that
i
leaned
still
i
was
unhappy
i
was
at
a
loss
whither
to
turn
for
comfort
of
religion
i
scarcely
knew
the
first
principles
this
state
i
met
with
a
plausible
but
man
he
had
zeal
and
a
sort
of
popular
eloquence
but
he
wanted
knowledge
and
argument
and
soundness
i
was
however
struck
with
his
earnestness
and
with
the
importance
of
some
truths
which
though
common
to
others
were
new
to
me
but
his
scheme
was
hollow
and
imperfect
and
his
leading
principle
subversive
of
all
morality
here
tyrrel
paused
i
intreated
him
to
spare
himself
but
after
a
few
deep
groans
he
proceeded
his
opinions
had
made
immoral
i
never
inquired
it
is
certain
they
were
calculated
to
make
his
hearers
so
instead
of
lowering
my
spiritual
disease
by
prescribing
repentence
and
humility
he
inflamed
it
by
cordials
all
was
high
all
was
animating
all
was
safe
on
no
better
ground
than
my
avowed
discontent
he
landed
me
at
one
in
a
security
so
much
the
more
fatal
as
it
laid
asleep
all
apprehension
he
mistook
my
uneasiness
for
a
complete
change
my
talking
of
sin
was
made
a
substitute
for
my
renouncing
it
proud
of
a
rich
man
for
a
convert
he
led
me
to
mistake
conviction
for
conversion
i
was
buoyed
up
with
an
unfounded
confidence
i
adopted
a
religion
which
promised
pardon
without
repentance
happiness
without
obedience
and
heaven
without
holiness
i
had
found
a
short
road
to
peace
i
never
inquired
if
it
were
a
safe
one
the
poor
man
now
fell
back
unable
to
speak
for
some
minutes
then
rallying
again
he
resumed
in
a
still
more
broken
voice
i
stopped
short
my
religion
had
made
no
change
in
my
heart
it
therefore
made
none
in
my
life
i
read
good
books
but
they
were
low
and
fanatical
in
their
language
and
antinomian
in
their
principle
but
my
religious
ignorance
was
so
deplorable
that
their
novelty
caught
strong
hold
of
me
i
now
desired
him
continued
barlow
not
to
exhaust
himself
further
i
prayed
with
him
he
was
struck
with
awe
at
the
holy
energy
in
the
office
for
the
sick
which
was
quite
new
to
him
he
owned
he
had
not
suspected
the
church
to
be
so
evangelical
this
is
no
uncommon
error
and
superficial
men
when
they
are
once
alarmed
are
rather
caught
by
phrases
than
sentiments
by
terms
than
principles
it
is
this
ignorance
of
the
doctrines
of
the
bible
and
of
the
church
in
which
men
of
the
world
unhappily
live
that
makes
it
so
difficult
for
us
to
address
them
under
sickness
and
affliction
we
have
no
common
ground
on
which
to
stand
no
intelligible
medium
through
which
to
communicate
with
them
it
is
having
both
a
language
and
a
science
to
learn
at
once
in
the
morning
barlow
again
visited
tyrrel
he
found
him
still
in
great
perturbation
of
mind
feeling
himself
quite
sensible
he
had
begun
to
make
his
will
he
had
made
large
bequests
to
several
charities
barlow
highly
approved
of
this
but
reminded
him
that
though
he
himself
would
never
recommend
charity
as
a
commutation
or
a
bribe
yet
some
immediate
acts
of
bounty
while
there
was
a
possibility
of
his
recovery
would
be
a
better
earnest
of
his
repentance
than
the
bequeathing
his
whole
estate
when
it
could
be
of
no
further
use
to
himself
he
was
all
acquiescence
he
desired
to
see
stanley
he
recommended
to
him
his
nephew
over
whose
conduct
stanley
promised
to
have
an
eye
he
made
him
and
barlow
joint
executors
he
offered
to
leave
them
half
his
fortune
with
their
usual
disinterestedness
they
positively
refused
to
accept
it
and
suggested
to
him
a
better
mode
of
bestowing
it
he
lifted
up
his
hands
and
eyes
saying
this
is
indeed
christianity
pure
undefiled
religion
if
it
be
not
faith
it
is
its
fruits
if
it
be
not
the
procuring
cause
of
salvation
it
is
one
evidence
of
a
safe
state
o
stanley
our
last
conversation
has
sunk
deep
into
my
heart
you
had
begun
to
pull
the
vail
from
my
eyes
but
nothing
tears
the
whole
mask
off
like
the
hand
of
death
like
impending
judgment
how
little
have
i
considered
eternity
judgment
was
not
in
all
my
thoughts
i
had
got
rid
of
the
terrors
of
responsibility
o
barlow
is
there
any
hope
for
me
sir
replied
the
doctor
your
sin
is
not
greater
because
you
feel
it
so
far
from
it
your
danger
diminishes
in
proportion
as
it
is
discerned
your
condition
is
not
worse
but
better
because
you
are
become
sensible
of
your
own
sins
and
wants
i
judge
far
more
favorably
of
your
state
now
than
when
you
thought
so
well
of
it
your
sense
of
the
evil
of
your
own
heart
is
the
best
proof
of
your
sincerity
your
repentance
toward
god
is
the
best
evidence
of
your
faith
in
our
lord
jesus
christ
doctor
it
is
too
late
replied
the
sick
man
how
can
i
show
that
my
repentance
is
sincere
in
this
miserable
condition
how
can
i
glorify
god
sir
replied
barlow
you
must
lay
anew
the
whole
foundation
of
your
faith
that
saviour
whom
you
had
unhappily
adopted
as
a
substitute
for
virtue
must
be
received
as
a
propitiation
for
sin
if
you
recover
you
must
devote
yourself
spirit
soul
and
body
to
his
service
you
must
adorn
his
gospel
by
your
conduct
you
must
plead
his
cause
in
your
conversation
you
must
recommend
his
doctrines
by
your
humility
you
must
dedicate
every
talent
god
has
given
you
to
his
glory
if
he
continue
to
visit
you
with
sickness
this
will
call
new
and
more
difficult
christian
graces
into
exercise
if
by
this
severe
affliction
you
lose
all
ability
to
do
god
actual
service
you
may
perhaps
glorify
him
more
effectually
by
casting
yourself
entirely
on
him
for
support
by
patient
suffering
for
his
sake
who
suffered
every
thing
for
yours
you
will
have
an
additional
call
for
trusting
in
the
divine
promises
an
additional
occasion
of
imitating
the
divine
example
a
stronger
motive
for
saying
practically
the
cup
which
my
father
has
given
me
shall
i
not
drink
it
o
doctor
said
the
unhappy
man
my
remorse
arises
not
merely
from
my
having
neglected
this
or
that
moral
duty
this
or
that
act
of
charity
but
from
the
melancholy
evidence
which
that
neglect
affords
that
my
religion
was
not
sincere
i
repeat
sir
said
barlow
that
your
false
security
and
unfounded
hope
were
more
alarming
than
your
present
distress
of
mind
examine
your
own
heart
fear
not
to
probe
it
to
the
bottom
it
will
be
a
salutary
smart
as
you
are
able
i
will
put
you
into
a
course
of
reading
the
scriptures
with
a
view
to
promote
try
yourself
by
the
strait
rule
they
hold
out
pray
fervently
that
the
almighty
may
assist
you
by
his
spirit
and
earnestly
endeavor
to
suffer
as
well
as
to
do
his
whole
will
barlow
says
he
thinks
there
is
now
as
little
prospect
of
his
perfect
recovery
as
of
his
immediate
dissolution
but
as
far
as
one
human
creature
can
judge
of
the
state
of
another
he
believes
the
visitation
will
be
salutary
chapter
xliv
as
we
were
sitting
at
supper
after
barlow
had
left
us
lady
belfield
turning
to
me
said
she
had
had
a
governess
proposed
to
her
from
a
quarter
i
should
little
expect
to
hear
she
then
produced
a
letter
informing
her
that
fentham
was
lately
found
dead
in
his
bed
of
an
apoplexy
that
he
had
died
insolvent
and
his
large
income
ceasing
with
his
life
his
family
were
plunged
into
the
utmost
distress
that
fentham
experienced
the
most
mortifying
neglect
from
her
numerous
and
noble
friends
who
now
that
she
could
no
longer
amuse
them
with
balls
concerts
and
suppers
revenged
themselves
by
wondering
what
she
could
ever
mean
by
giving
them
at
all
and
declaring
what
a
bore
it
had
always
been
to
them
to
go
to
her
parties
they
now
insisted
that
people
ought
to
confine
themselves
to
their
own
station
and
live
within
their
income
though
they
themselves
had
lifted
her
above
her
station
and
had
led
her
to
exceed
her
income
the
poor
woman
continued
lady
belfield
is
in
extreme
distress
her
magnificently
furnished
house
will
go
but
a
very
little
way
toward
satisfying
her
creditors
that
house
whose
clamorous
knocker
used
to
keep
the
neighborhood
awake
is
already
reduced
to
utter
stillness
the
splendid
apartments
brilliant
with
lustres
and
and
crowded
with
company
are
become
a
frightful
solitude
terrifying
to
those
to
whom
solitude
has
not
one
consolation
or
resource
to
offer
poor
fentham
is
more
wounded
by
this
total
desertion
of
those
whom
she
so
sumptuously
fed
and
so
obsequiously
flattered
than
by
her
actual
wants
it
is
said
sir
john
a
fine
exemplification
of
the
friendships
of
the
world
confederacies
in
vice
or
leagues
in
pleasure
lady
denham
when
applied
to
resumed
lady
belfield
said
that
she
was
extremely
sorry
for
them
but
as
she
thought
extravagance
the
greatest
of
faults
it
would
look
like
an
encouragement
to
imprudence
if
she
did
any
thing
for
them
their
extravagance
however
had
never
been
objected
to
by
her
till
the
fountain
which
had
supplied
it
was
stopped
and
she
had
for
years
made
no
scruple
of
winning
money
almost
nightly
from
the
woman
whose
distresses
she
now
refused
to
relieve
lady
denham
further
assigned
the
misery
into
which
the
elopement
of
her
darling
child
with
signor
squallini
had
brought
her
as
an
additional
reason
for
withholding
her
kindness
from
mrs
fentham
it
is
a
reason
said
i
interrupting
lady
belfield
which
in
a
mind
would
have
had
a
directly
contrary
operation
when
domestic
calamity
overtakes
us
is
it
not
the
precise
moment
for
holding
out
a
hand
to
the
wretched
for
diminishing
the
misery
abroad
which
at
home
may
be
irretrievable
lady
bab
lawless
to
whom
fentham
applied
for
assistance
coolly
advised
her
to
send
her
daughters
to
service
saying
she
knew
of
no
acquirement
they
had
which
would
be
of
any
use
to
them
except
their
skill
in
it
seemed
a
cruel
reproach
from
a
professed
friend
said
sir
john
and
yet
it
is
a
literal
truth
i
know
not
what
can
be
done
for
them
or
for
what
they
are
fit
their
accomplishments
might
be
turned
to
some
account
if
they
were
accompanied
with
real
knowledge
useful
acquirements
or
sober
habits
fentham
wishes
us
to
recommend
them
as
governesses
but
can
i
conscientiously
recommend
to
others
girls
with
whom
i
could
not
trust
my
own
family
had
they
been
taught
to
look
no
higher
than
the
clerks
of
their
father
who
had
been
a
clerk
himself
they
might
have
been
happy
but
those
very
men
will
now
think
them
as
much
beneath
themselves
as
the
young
ladies
lately
thought
they
were
above
them
i
have
often
said
stanley
been
amused
with
observing
what
a
magic
transformation
the
same
event
produces
on
two
opposite
classes
of
characters
the
misfortunes
of
their
acquaintance
convert
worldly
friends
into
instantaneous
strictness
of
principle
the
faults
of
the
distressed
are
produced
as
a
plea
for
their
own
covetousness
while
that
very
misfortune
so
relaxes
the
strictness
of
good
men
that
the
faults
are
forgotten
in
the
calamity
and
they
who
had
been
perpetually
warning
the
prodigal
of
his
impending
ruin
when
that
ruin
comes
are
the
first
to
relieve
him
it
was
agreed
among
us
that
some
small
contribution
must
be
added
to
a
little
sum
that
had
been
already
raised
for
their
immediate
relief
but
that
nothing
was
so
difficult
as
effectually
to
serve
persons
whose
views
wore
so
disproportioned
to
their
deserts
and
whose
habits
would
be
too
likely
to
carry
corruption
into
families
who
might
receive
them
from
charitable
motives
the
conversation
then
fell
insensibly
on
the
pleasure
we
had
enjoyed
since
we
had
been
together
and
on
the
delights
of
rational
society
and
confidential
intercourse
such
as
ours
had
been
where
minds
mingled
and
affection
and
esteem
were
reciprocal
stanley
said
many
things
which
evinced
how
happily
his
piety
was
combined
with
the
most
affectionate
tenderness
of
heart
indeed
i
had
always
been
delighted
to
observe
in
him
a
quality
which
is
not
so
common
as
it
is
thought
to
be
a
thorough
capacity
for
friendship
my
dear
stanley
said
sir
john
it
is
of
the
very
essence
of
human
enjoyments
that
they
must
have
an
end
i
observe
with
regret
that
the
time
assigned
for
our
visit
is
more
than
elapsed
we
have
prolonged
it
beyond
our
intention
beyond
our
convenience
but
we
have
i
trust
been
imbibing
principles
stealing
habits
and
borrowing
plans
which
will
ever
make
us
consider
this
visit
as
an
important
era
in
our
lives
my
excellent
caroline
is
deeply
affected
with
all
she
has
seen
and
heard
at
the
grove
we
must
now
leave
it
though
not
without
reluctance
we
must
go
and
endeavor
to
imitate
what
six
weeks
ago
we
almost
feared
to
contemplate
lady
belfield
and
i
have
compared
notes
on
the
most
mature
deliberation
we
agree
that
we
have
lived
long
enough
to
the
world
we
agree
that
it
is
time
to
begin
to
live
to
ourselves
and
to
him
who
made
us
we
propose
in
future
to
make
our
winters
in
london
much
shorter
we
intend
to
remove
early
every
spring
to
beechwood
which
we
will
no
longer
consider
as
a
temporary
residence
but
as
our
home
we
will
supply
it
with
every
thing
that
may
make
it
interesting
and
improving
to
us
all
we
are
resolved
to
educate
our
children
in
the
fear
of
god
our
fondness
for
them
is
rather
increased
than
diminished
but
in
the
exercise
of
that
fondness
we
will
remember
that
we
are
to
train
them
for
immortality
we
will
watch
over
them
as
creatures
for
whose
eternal
a
vast
responsibility
will
attach
to
ourselves
in
our
new
plan
of
life
we
shall
have
fewer
sacrifices
to
make
than
most
people
in
our
situation
for
we
have
long
felt
a
growing
indifference
for
things
which
we
appeared
to
enjoy
of
the
world
we
are
only
going
to
give
up
that
part
which
is
not
worth
keeping
and
of
which
we
are
really
weary
in
securing
our
real
friends
we
shall
not
regret
if
we
drop
some
acquaintances
by
the
way
the
wise
and
the
worthy
we
shall
more
than
ever
cherish
in
your
family
we
have
enjoyed
those
true
pleasures
which
entail
no
repentance
that
cheerfulness
which
alone
is
worthy
of
accountable
beings
we
shall
industriously
maintain
in
our
own
i
bless
god
if
we
have
not
so
many
steps
to
tread
back
as
some
others
have
who
are
entering
upon
principle
on
a
new
course
of
life
we
have
always
endeavored
though
with
much
imperfection
to
fill
some
duties
to
each
other
to
our
children
to
our
friends
and
to
the
poor
but
of
the
prime
duty
the
main
spring
of
action
and
of
all
moral
goodness
duty
to
god
we
have
not
been
sufficiently
mindful
i
hope
we
have
at
length
learned
to
consider
him
as
the
fountain
of
all
good
and
the
gospel
of
his
son
as
the
fountain
of
all
hope
this
new
principle
i
am
persuaded
will
never
impair
our
cheerfulness
it
will
only
fix
it
on
a
solid
ground
by
purifying
the
motive
it
will
raise
the
enjoyment
but
if
we
have
not
so
many
bad
habits
to
correct
as
poor
carlton
had
i
question
if
we
have
not
as
many
difficulties
to
meet
in
another
way
his
loose
course
was
discreditable
his
vices
made
him
stand
ill
with
the
world
he
would
therefore
acquire
nothing
but
credit
in
changing
his
outward
practice
lady
belfield
and
i
on
the
contrary
stand
rather
too
well
with
the
world
we
had
just
that
external
regularity
that
cool
indifference
about
our
own
spiritual
improvement
and
the
wrong
courses
of
our
friends
which
procure
regard
because
they
do
not
interfere
with
others
nor
excite
jealousy
for
ourselves
but
we
have
now
to
encounter
that
censure
which
we
have
perhaps
hitherto
been
too
solicitous
to
avoid
it
will
still
be
our
trial
but
i
humbly
trust
that
it
will
be
no
longer
our
snare
our
morality
pleased
because
it
seemed
to
proceed
merely
from
a
sense
of
propriety
our
strictness
will
offend
when
it
is
found
to
spring
from
a
principle
of
religion
to
what
tendency
in
the
heart
of
man
my
dear
stanley
is
it
owing
that
religion
is
commonly
seen
to
excite
more
suspicion
than
the
want
of
it
when
a
man
of
the
world
meets
with
a
gay
thoughtless
amusing
person
he
seldom
thinks
of
inquiring
whether
such
a
one
be
immoral
or
an
unbeliever
or
a
profligate
though
the
bent
of
his
conversation
rather
leans
that
way
satisfied
with
what
he
finds
him
he
feels
little
solicitude
to
ascertain
what
he
really
is
but
no
sooner
does
actual
piety
show
itself
in
any
man
than
your
friends
are
putting
you
on
your
guard
there
is
instantly
a
suggestion
a
hint
a
suspicion
he
not
carry
things
too
far
he
not
righteous
over
much
he
not
intemperate
in
his
zeal
all
things
is
he
and
in
short
for
that
is
the
centre
in
which
all
the
lines
of
suspicion
and
reprobation
meet
he
not
a
methodist
i
trust
however
that
through
divine
grace
our
minds
will
be
fortified
against
all
attacks
on
this
our
weak
side
this
pass
through
which
the
sort
of
assaults
most
formidable
to
us
will
be
likely
to
enter
i
was
mentioning
this
danger
to
caroline
this
morning
she
opened
her
bible
over
which
she
now
spends
much
of
her
solitary
time
and
with
an
emphasis
foreign
from
her
usual
manner
read
ye
from
man
whose
breath
is
in
his
nostrils
for
wherein
is
he
to
be
accounted
of
as
sir
john
repeated
these
words
i
saw
lucilla
who
was
sitting
next
lady
belfield
snatch
one
of
her
hands
and
kiss
it
with
a
rapture
which
she
had
no
power
to
control
it
was
evident
that
nothing
but
our
presence
restrained
her
from
rising
to
embrace
her
friend
her
fine
eyes
glistened
but
seeing
that
i
observed
her
she
gently
let
go
the
hand
she
held
and
tried
to
look
composed
i
can
not
describe
the
chastised
but
not
less
fervent
joy
of
and
stanley
their
looks
expressed
the
affectionate
interest
they
took
in
sir
john
honest
declaration
their
hearts
overflowed
with
gratitude
to
him
without
whom
nothing
is
strong
nothing
is
holy
for
my
own
part
i
felt
myself
raised
above
this
visible
diurnal
sphere
sir
john
afterward
said
i
begin
more
and
more
to
perceive
the
scantiness
of
all
morality
which
has
not
the
love
of
god
for
its
motive
virtue
will
not
carry
us
safely
and
will
not
carry
us
far
which
looks
to
human
estimation
as
its
reward
as
it
was
a
false
and
inadequate
principle
which
first
set
it
a
going
it
will
always
stop
short
of
the
true
ends
of
goodness
sir
john
said
lady
belfield
i
have
been
seriously
thinking
that
i
ought
not
to
indulge
in
the
expense
of
this
intended
conservatory
we
will
if
you
please
convert
the
money
to
the
building
of
a
charity
school
i
can
not
consent
to
incur
such
a
superfluous
expense
for
my
amusement
my
dear
caroline
replied
sir
john
through
the
undeserved
goodness
of
god
my
estate
is
so
large
and
through
your
excellent
management
it
is
so
unimpaired
that
we
will
not
give
up
the
conservatory
unless
stanley
thinks
we
ought
to
give
it
up
but
we
will
adopt
lucilla
idea
of
combining
a
charity
with
an
indulgence
we
will
associate
the
charity
school
with
the
conservatory
this
union
will
be
a
kind
of
monument
to
our
friends
at
the
grove
from
whom
you
have
acquired
the
love
of
plants
and
i
of
religious
charity
we
all
looked
with
anxious
expectation
at
stanley
he
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
as
lady
belfield
was
now
resolved
to
live
the
greater
part
of
the
year
in
the
country
she
ought
to
have
some
amusements
in
lieu
of
those
she
was
going
to
give
up
costly
decorations
and
expensive
gardens
continued
he
at
a
place
where
the
proprietors
do
not
so
much
as
to
reside
have
always
appeared
to
me
among
the
infatuations
of
opulence
to
the
expenses
which
they
do
not
it
is
adding
an
expense
which
they
do
not
but
surely
at
a
mansion
where
an
affluent
family
actually
all
reasonable
indulgences
should
be
allowed
and
where
a
garden
and
are
to
supply
to
the
proprietor
the
place
of
the
abdicated
theatre
and
and
especially
when
it
is
to
be
a
means
in
her
hands
of
attaching
her
children
to
the
country
and
of
teaching
them
to
love
home
i
declare
myself
in
favor
of
the
conservatory
lucilla
eyes
sparkled
but
she
said
nothing
it
would
be
unfair
continued
stanley
to
blame
too
severely
those
who
living
constantly
in
the
country
give
a
little
in
to
its
appropriate
pleasures
the
real
objects
of
censure
seem
to
be
those
who
grafting
bad
taste
on
bad
habits
bring
into
the
country
the
amusements
of
the
town
and
superadd
to
such
as
are
local
and
natural
and
innocent
such
as
are
foreign
artificial
and
corrupt
my
dear
stanley
said
sir
john
we
have
resolved
to
indemnify
our
poor
neighbors
for
two
injuries
which
we
have
been
doing
them
the
one
is
by
our
having
lived
so
little
among
them
for
i
have
now
learned
that
the
mere
act
of
residence
is
a
kind
of
charity
even
in
the
uncharitable
as
it
necessarily
causes
much
money
to
be
spent
even
where
little
is
given
the
other
is
that
we
will
endeavor
to
make
up
for
our
past
indifference
to
their
spiritual
concerns
by
now
acting
as
if
we
were
aware
that
the
poor
have
souls
as
well
as
bodies
and
that
in
the
great
day
of
account
the
care
of
both
will
attach
to
our
responsibility
such
a
sense
of
sober
joy
seemed
to
pervade
our
little
party
that
we
were
not
aware
that
the
night
was
far
advanced
our
minds
were
too
highly
set
for
much
loquacity
when
ph
oe
be
suddenly
exclaimed
papa
why
is
it
that
happiness
does
not
make
one
merry
i
never
was
half
so
happy
in
my
life
and
yet
i
can
hardly
forbear
crying
and
i
believe
it
is
catching
sir
for
look
lucilla
is
not
much
wiser
than
myself
the
next
day
but
one
after
this
conversation
our
valuable
friends
left
us
our
separation
was
softened
by
the
prospect
of
a
speedy
meeting
the
day
before
they
set
out
lady
belfield
made
an
earnest
request
to
and
stanley
that
they
would
have
the
goodness
to
receive
fanny
stokes
into
their
family
for
a
few
months
previous
to
her
entering
theirs
as
governess
i
can
think
of
no
method
so
likely
continued
she
to
raise
the
tone
of
education
in
my
own
family
as
the
transfusion
into
it
of
your
spirit
and
the
adoption
of
your
regulations
and
stanley
most
cheerfully
acceded
to
the
proposal
sir
john
said
i
was
meditating
the
same
request
but
with
an
additional
clause
tacked
to
it
that
of
sending
our
eldest
girl
with
fanny
that
the
child
also
may
get
imbued
with
something
of
your
family
spirit
and
be
broken
into
better
habits
than
she
has
acquired
from
our
hitherto
relaxed
discipline
this
proposal
was
also
cordially
approved
chapter
xlv
barlow
came
to
the
grove
to
take
leave
of
our
friends
he
found
sir
john
and
i
sitting
in
the
library
with
stanley
as
i
came
from
tyrrel
said
the
doctor
i
met
flam
going
to
see
him
he
seemed
so
anxious
about
his
old
friend
that
a
wish
strongly
presented
itself
to
my
mind
that
the
awful
situation
of
the
sick
man
might
be
salutary
to
him
it
is
impossible
to
say
continued
he
what
injury
religion
has
suffered
from
the
opposite
characters
of
these
two
men
flam
who
gives
himself
no
concern
about
the
matter
is
kind
and
generous
while
tyrrel
who
has
made
a
high
profession
is
mean
and
sordid
it
has
been
said
of
what
use
is
religion
when
morality
has
made
flam
a
better
man
than
religion
makes
tyrrel
thus
men
of
the
world
reason
but
nothing
can
be
more
false
than
their
conclusions
flam
is
naturally
an
open
man
but
incorrect
in
many
respects
and
rather
loose
in
his
principles
his
natural
good
propensities
religion
would
have
improved
into
solid
virtues
and
would
have
cured
the
more
exceptionable
parts
of
his
character
but
from
religion
he
stands
aloof
tyrrel
is
naturally
narrow
and
selfish
religion
has
not
made
but
found
him
such
but
what
a
religion
has
he
adopted
a
mere
assumption
of
terms
a
dead
inoperative
uninfluencing
notion
which
he
has
taken
up
not
i
hope
with
a
view
to
deceive
others
but
by
which
he
has
grossly
deceived
himself
he
had
heard
that
religion
was
a
cure
for
an
uneasy
mind
but
he
did
not
attend
to
the
means
by
which
the
cure
is
effected
and
it
relieved
not
him
the
corrupt
principle
whence
his
vices
proceeded
was
not
subdued
he
did
not
desire
to
subdue
it
because
in
the
struggle
he
must
have
parted
with
what
he
was
resolved
to
keep
he
adopted
what
he
believed
was
a
cheap
and
easy
religion
little
aware
that
the
great
fundamental
scripture
doctrine
of
salvation
by
jesus
christ
was
a
doctrine
powerfully
opposing
our
corruptions
and
involving
in
its
comprehensive
requirements
a
new
heart
and
a
new
life
at
this
moment
flam
called
at
the
grove
i
am
just
come
from
tyrrel
said
he
i
fear
it
is
nearly
over
with
him
poor
ned
he
is
very
low
almost
in
despair
i
always
told
him
that
the
time
would
come
when
he
would
be
glad
to
exchange
notions
for
actions
i
am
grieved
for
him
the
remembrance
of
a
kind
deed
or
two
done
to
a
poor
tenant
would
be
some
comfort
to
him
now
at
a
time
when
every
man
stands
in
need
of
comfort
sir
said
barlow
the
scene
which
i
have
lately
witnessed
at
tyrrel
makes
me
serious
if
you
and
i
were
alone
i
am
afraid
it
would
make
me
bold
i
will
however
suppress
the
answer
i
was
tempted
to
make
you
because
i
should
not
think
it
prudent
or
respectful
to
utter
before
company
what
i
am
persuaded
your
good
sense
would
permit
me
to
say
were
we
alone
doctor
replied
the
but
thoughtless
man
do
stand
upon
ceremony
you
know
i
love
a
debate
and
i
insist
on
your
saying
what
was
in
your
mind
to
say
i
do
fear
getting
out
of
any
scrape
you
can
bring
me
into
you
are
too
to
offend
and
i
hope
i
am
too
to
be
easily
offended
stanley
i
know
always
takes
your
side
sir
john
i
trust
will
take
mine
and
so
will
the
young
man
here
if
he
is
like
most
other
young
men
allow
me
then
to
observe
returned
barlow
that
if
tyrrel
has
unhappily
deceived
himself
by
resting
too
exclusively
on
a
mere
speculative
faith
a
faith
which
by
his
conduct
did
not
evince
itself
to
be
of
the
right
sort
yet
on
the
other
hand
a
dependence
for
salvation
on
our
own
benevolence
our
own
integrity
or
any
other
good
quality
we
may
possess
is
an
error
not
less
fatal
and
far
more
usual
such
a
dependence
does
as
practically
set
at
naught
the
redeemer
sacrifice
as
the
avowed
rejection
of
the
infidel
honesty
and
benevolence
are
among
the
noblest
qualities
but
where
the
one
is
practiced
for
reputation
and
the
other
from
mere
feeling
they
are
sadly
delusive
as
to
the
ends
of
practical
goodness
they
have
both
indeed
their
reward
integrity
in
the
credit
it
brings
and
benevolence
in
the
pleasure
it
yields
both
are
beneficial
to
society
both
therefore
are
politically
valuable
both
sometimes
lead
me
to
admire
the
ordinations
of
that
overruling
power
which
often
uses
as
instruments
of
public
good
men
who
acting
well
in
many
respects
are
essentially
useful
to
others
but
who
acting
from
motives
merely
human
forfeit
for
themselves
that
high
reward
which
those
virtues
would
obtain
if
they
were
evidences
of
a
lively
faith
and
the
results
of
christian
principle
think
me
not
severe
flam
to
be
personal
is
always
extremely
painful
to
me
no
no
doctor
replied
he
i
know
you
mean
well
is
your
trade
to
give
good
counsel
and
your
lot
i
suppose
to
have
it
seldom
followed
i
shall
hear
you
without
being
angry
you
in
turn
must
not
be
angry
if
i
hear
you
without
being
better
i
respect
you
sir
too
much
replied
barlow
to
deceive
you
in
a
matter
of
such
infinite
importance
for
one
man
who
errs
on
principle
a
hundred
err
on
yours
his
mistake
is
equally
pernicious
but
it
is
not
equally
common
i
must
repeat
it
for
one
whose
soul
is
endangered
through
an
unwarranted
dependence
on
the
saviour
multitudes
are
destroyed
not
only
by
the
open
rejection
but
through
a
fatal
neglect
of
the
salvation
wrought
by
him
many
more
perish
through
a
presumptuous
confidence
in
their
own
merits
than
through
an
unscriptural
trust
in
the
merits
of
christ
well
doctor
replied
flam
i
must
say
that
i
think
an
ounce
of
morality
will
go
further
toward
making
up
my
accounts
than
a
ton
of
religion
for
which
no
one
but
myself
would
be
the
better
my
dear
sir
said
barlow
i
will
not
presume
to
determine
between
the
exact
comparative
proportions
of
two
ingredients
both
of
which
are
so
indispensable
in
the
composition
of
a
christian
i
dare
not
hazard
the
assertion
which
of
the
two
is
the
more
perilous
state
but
i
think
i
am
justified
in
saying
which
of
the
two
cases
occurs
most
frequently
flam
said
i
should
be
sorry
barlow
to
find
out
at
this
time
of
day
that
i
have
been
all
my
life
long
in
an
error
believe
me
sir
said
barlow
it
is
better
to
find
it
out
now
than
at
a
still
later
period
one
good
quality
can
never
be
made
to
supply
the
absence
of
another
there
are
no
substitutes
in
this
warfare
nor
can
all
the
good
qualities
put
together
if
we
could
suppose
them
to
unite
in
one
man
and
to
exist
without
religion
stand
proxy
for
the
death
of
christ
if
they
could
so
exist
it
would
be
in
the
degree
only
and
not
in
the
perfection
required
by
that
law
which
said
do
and
so
kind
a
neighbor
as
you
are
so
honest
a
gentleman
so
generous
a
master
as
you
are
allowed
to
be
i
can
not
sir
think
without
pain
of
your
losing
the
reward
of
such
valuable
qualities
by
your
placing
your
hope
of
eternal
happiness
in
the
exercise
of
them
believe
me
flam
it
is
easier
for
a
compassionate
man
if
he
be
not
religious
to
all
his
goods
to
the
poor
than
to
bring
every
thought
than
to
bring
thought
into
captivity
to
the
obedience
of
christ
but
be
assured
if
we
give
ever
so
much
with
our
hands
while
we
withhold
our
hearts
from
god
though
we
may
do
much
good
to
others
we
do
none
to
ourselves
why
surely
said
flam
you
do
mean
to
insinuate
that
i
should
be
in
a
safer
state
if
i
never
did
a
kind
thing
quite
the
contrary
replied
barlow
but
i
could
wish
to
see
your
good
actions
exalted
by
springing
from
a
higher
principle
i
mean
the
love
of
god
ennobled
by
being
practiced
to
a
higher
end
and
purified
by
your
renouncing
all
in
the
performance
but
is
there
not
less
danger
sir
said
flam
in
being
somewhat
proud
of
what
one
really
than
in
doing
nothing
and
is
it
not
more
excusable
to
be
a
little
satisfied
with
what
one
really
than
in
hypocritically
pretending
to
be
what
one
is
i
must
repeat
returned
barlow
that
i
can
not
exactly
decide
on
the
question
of
relative
enormity
between
two
opposite
sins
i
can
not
pronounce
which
is
the
best
of
two
states
so
very
bad
why
now
doctor
said
flam
what
particular
sin
can
you
charge
me
with
i
erect
not
myself
into
an
accuser
replied
barlow
but
permit
me
to
ask
you
sir
from
what
motive
is
it
that
you
avoid
any
wrong
practice
is
there
any
one
sin
from
which
you
abstain
through
the
fear
of
offending
your
maker
as
to
that
replied
flam
i
ca
say
i
ever
considered
about
the
motive
of
the
thing
i
thought
it
was
quite
enough
not
to
do
it
well
but
doctor
since
we
are
gone
so
far
in
the
catechism
what
duty
to
my
neighbor
can
you
convict
me
of
omitting
it
will
be
well
sir
said
the
doctor
if
you
can
indeed
stand
so
close
a
scrutiny
as
that
to
which
you
challenge
me
even
on
your
own
principles
but
tell
me
with
that
frank
honesty
which
marks
your
character
does
your
kindness
to
your
neighbor
spring
from
the
true
fountain
the
love
of
god
that
you
do
many
right
things
i
am
most
willing
to
allow
but
do
you
perform
them
from
a
sense
of
obedience
to
the
law
of
your
maker
do
you
perform
them
because
they
are
commanded
in
his
word
and
conformable
to
his
will
i
ca
say
i
do
said
flam
but
if
the
thing
be
right
in
itself
that
appears
to
me
to
be
all
in
all
it
seems
hard
to
encumber
a
man
of
business
like
me
with
the
action
and
the
motive
too
surely
if
i
serve
a
man
it
can
make
no
difference
to
him
i
serve
him
to
yourself
my
dear
sir
said
the
doctor
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
besides
good
actions
performed
on
any
other
principle
than
obedience
are
not
only
spurious
as
to
their
birth
but
they
are
defective
in
themselves
they
commonly
want
something
in
weight
and
measure
why
doctor
said
flam
i
have
often
heard
you
say
in
the
pulpit
that
the
best
are
not
perfect
now
as
this
is
the
case
i
will
tell
you
how
i
manage
i
think
it
a
safe
way
to
average
one
good
qualities
to
throw
a
bad
one
against
a
good
one
and
if
the
balance
sinks
on
the
right
side
the
man
is
safe
barlow
shook
his
head
and
was
beginning
to
express
his
regret
at
such
delusive
casuistry
when
flam
interrupted
him
by
saying
well
doctor
my
great
care
in
life
has
been
to
avoid
all
suspicion
of
hypocrisy
you
can
not
do
better
replied
barlow
than
to
avoid
its
but
for
my
own
part
i
believe
religious
hypocrisy
to
be
rather
a
rare
vice
among
persons
of
your
station
in
life
among
the
vulgar
indeed
i
fear
it
is
not
so
rare
in
neighborhoods
where
there
is
much
real
piety
there
is
no
small
danger
of
some
false
profession
but
among
the
higher
classes
of
society
serious
religion
confers
so
little
credit
on
him
who
professes
it
that
a
gentleman
is
not
likely
to
put
on
appearances
from
which
he
knows
he
is
far
more
likely
to
lose
reputation
than
to
acquire
it
when
such
a
man
therefore
assumes
the
character
of
piety
i
own
i
always
feel
disposed
to
give
him
full
credit
for
possessing
it
his
religion
may
indeed
be
mistaken
it
may
be
defective
it
may
even
be
unsound
but
the
chances
are
very
much
in
favor
of
its
not
being
insincere
where
piety
is
genuine
it
can
not
be
altogether
concealed
where
fruits
of
the
spirit
abound
they
will
appear
now
my
dear
doctor
replied
flam
is
not
that
cant
what
do
you
mean
by
the
fruits
of
the
spirit
would
it
not
have
been
more
worthy
of
your
good
sense
to
have
said
morality
or
virtue
would
not
these
terms
have
been
more
simple
and
intelligible
they
might
be
so
rejoined
the
doctor
but
they
would
not
rise
quite
so
high
they
would
not
take
in
my
meaning
the
fruit
of
the
spirit
indeed
always
includes
meaning
but
it
includes
much
more
it
is
something
higher
than
worldly
morality
something
holier
than
mere
human
virtue
i
rather
conceive
morality
in
your
sense
to
be
the
effect
of
natural
temper
natural
conscience
or
worldly
prudence
or
perhaps
a
combination
of
all
three
the
fruit
of
the
spirit
is
the
morality
of
the
renewed
heart
worldly
morality
is
easily
satisfied
with
itself
it
sits
down
contented
with
its
own
meagre
performances
with
legal
honesty
with
bare
weight
justice
it
seldom
gives
a
particle
is
not
in
the
bond
it
is
always
making
out
its
claim
to
doubtful
indulgences
it
litigates
its
right
to
every
inch
of
contested
enjoyment
and
is
so
fearful
of
not
getting
enough
that
it
commonly
takes
more
than
its
due
it
is
one
of
the
cases
where
letter
killeth
but
the
spirit
giveth
life
it
obtains
however
its
worldly
reward
it
procures
a
good
degree
of
respect
and
commendation
but
it
is
not
attended
by
the
silent
train
of
the
christian
graces
with
that
peace
gentleness
goodness
faith
which
are
the
fruits
of
the
spirit
and
the
evidences
of
a
christian
these
graces
are
calculated
to
adorn
all
that
is
right
with
all
that
is
amiable
things
are
honest
and
just
with
things
are
lovely
and
of
good
report
and
to
crown
all
they
add
the
deepest
humility
and
most
unfeigned
to
the
most
correct
course
of
conduct
a
course
of
conduct
which
though
a
christian
never
thinks
himself
at
liberty
to
neglect
he
never
feels
himself
permitted
or
disposed
to
be
proud
of
well
well
doctor
said
flam
i
never
denied
the
truth
of
christianity
as
carlton
formerly
did
is
the
religion
of
the
country
by
law
established
and
i
often
go
to
church
because
that
too
is
established
by
law
for
which
you
know
i
have
a
great
veneration
is
the
religion
of
my
ancestors
i
like
it
for
that
too
but
sir
said
the
doctor
would
you
not
show
your
veneration
for
the
church
more
fully
if
you
attended
it
twice
instead
of
once
and
your
veneration
for
the
law
if
instead
of
going
sometimes
you
went
every
sunday
which
you
know
both
the
law
of
god
and
man
enjoins
why
unluckily
returned
flam
the
hour
of
service
interferes
with
that
of
dinner
sir
said
barlow
smiling
hours
are
so
altered
that
i
believe
if
the
church
were
to
new
model
the
calendar
she
would
say
that
dinners
ought
to
be
placed
among
the
an
hour
earlier
or
later
would
accommodate
the
difference
liberate
your
servants
and
enable
you
to
do
a
thing
right
in
itself
and
beneficial
in
its
example
flam
not
being
prepared
with
an
answer
went
on
with
his
confession
of
faith
doctor
said
he
i
am
a
better
christian
than
you
think
i
take
it
for
granted
that
the
bible
is
true
for
i
have
heard
many
men
say
who
have
examined
for
themselves
which
i
can
not
say
i
have
ever
had
time
or
inclination
to
do
that
no
opposer
has
ever
yet
refuted
the
scripture
account
of
miracles
and
prophecies
so
if
you
do
call
this
being
a
good
christian
i
do
know
what
is
barlow
replied
nothing
can
be
better
as
far
as
it
goes
but
allow
me
to
say
that
there
is
another
kind
of
evidence
of
the
truth
of
our
religion
which
is
peculiar
to
the
real
christian
i
mean
that
evidence
which
arises
from
his
individual
conviction
of
the
efficacy
of
christianity
in
remedying
the
disorders
of
his
own
nature
he
who
has
had
his
own
temper
improved
his
evil
propensities
subdued
and
his
whole
character
formed
anew
by
being
cast
in
the
mold
of
christianity
will
have
little
doubt
of
the
truth
of
a
religion
which
has
produced
such
obvious
effects
in
himself
the
truths
for
which
his
reason
pleads
and
in
which
his
understanding
after
much
examination
is
able
to
rest
having
had
a
purifying
influence
on
his
heart
become
established
principles
producing
in
him
at
the
same
time
holiness
of
life
and
peace
of
conscience
the
stronger
evidence
a
man
has
of
his
own
internal
improvement
the
stronger
will
be
his
conviction
of
the
truth
of
the
religion
he
professes
there
are
worse
men
than
i
am
doctor
said
flam
rather
seriously
sir
replied
he
i
heartily
wish
every
gentleman
had
your
good
qualities
but
as
we
shall
be
judged
positively
and
not
comparatively
as
our
characters
will
be
finally
decided
upon
not
by
our
superiority
to
other
men
nor
merely
by
our
inferiority
to
the
divine
rule
but
by
our
departure
from
it
i
wish
you
would
begin
to
square
your
life
by
that
rule
now
which
in
order
that
you
may
do
you
should
begin
to
study
it
while
we
live
in
a
total
neglect
of
the
bible
we
must
not
talk
of
our
deficiencies
our
failings
our
imperfections
as
if
these
alone
stood
between
us
and
the
mercy
of
god
that
indeed
is
the
language
and
the
state
of
the
devout
christian
stronger
terms
must
be
used
to
express
the
alienation
of
heart
of
those
who
living
in
the
avowed
neglect
of
scripture
maybe
said
forgive
me
sir
live
without
god
in
the
world
ignorance
is
no
plea
in
a
gentleman
in
a
land
of
light
and
knowledge
ignorance
itself
is
a
sin
here
barlow
being
silent
and
flam
not
being
prepared
to
answer
stanley
said
that
the
pure
and
virtuous
dispositions
which
arise
out
of
a
sincere
belief
of
christianity
are
not
more
frequently
seen
in
persons
professing
themselves
to
be
christians
is
unhappily
one
of
the
strongest
arguments
against
us
that
can
be
urged
by
unbelievers
instances
however
occur
which
are
too
plain
to
be
denied
of
individuals
who
having
been
led
by
divine
grace
cordially
to
receive
christianity
have
exhibited
in
their
conduct
a
very
striking
proof
of
its
excellence
and
among
these
are
some
who
like
our
friend
carlton
had
previously
led
very
corrupt
lives
the
ordinary
class
of
christians
who
indeed
scarcely
deserve
the
name
as
well
as
skeptics
and
unbelievers
would
do
well
to
mark
the
lives
of
the
truly
religious
and
to
consider
them
as
furnishing
a
proof
which
will
come
powerfully
in
aid
of
that
body
of
testimony
with
which
christianity
is
intrenched
on
all
sides
and
these
observers
should
remember
that
though
they
themselves
may
not
yet
possess
that
best
evidence
in
favor
of
christianity
which
arises
from
an
inward
sense
of
its
purifying
nature
they
may
nevertheless
aspire
after
it
and
those
who
have
any
remaining
doubts
should
encourage
themselves
with
the
hope
that
if
they
fully
yield
themselves
to
the
doctrines
and
precepts
of
the
gospel
a
salutary
change
will
in
time
be
effected
in
their
own
hearts
which
will
furnish
them
with
irresistible
evidence
of
its
truth
i
could
easily
perceive
that
though
stanley
and
barlow
entertained
small
hopes
of
the
beneficial
effect
of
their
discourse
on
the
person
to
whom
it
was
directed
yet
they
prolonged
it
with
an
eye
to
sir
john
belfield
who
sat
profoundly
attentive
and
encouraged
them
by
his
looks
as
to
flam
it
was
amusing
to
observe
the
variety
of
his
motions
gestures
and
contortions
and
the
pains
he
took
to
appear
easy
and
indifferent
and
even
victorious
sometimes
fixing
the
end
of
his
whip
on
the
floor
and
whirling
it
around
at
full
speed
then
working
it
into
his
boot
then
making
up
his
mouth
for
a
whistle
but
stopping
short
to
avoid
being
guilty
of
the
incivility
of
interruption
at
length
with
the
same
invincible
good
nature
and
with
the
same
pitiable
insensibility
to
his
own
state
he
arose
to
take
leave
he
shook
us
all
by
the
hand
barlow
twice
saying
doctor
i
think
the
worse
of
you
for
your
plain
speaking
he
is
a
knave
or
a
fool
that
is
angry
with
a
good
man
for
doing
his
duty
is
my
fault
if
i
do
take
his
advice
but
is
his
fault
if
he
does
not
give
it
parsons
are
paid
for
it
and
ought
not
to
be
when
there
is
a
proper
opening
such
as
poor
tyrrel
case
gave
you
i
challenged
i
should
perhaps
have
been
angry
if
you
had
challenged
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
event
of
a
duel
which
is
the
challenger
as
to
myself
it
is
time
enough
for
me
to
think
of
the
things
you
recommend
thank
god
i
am
in
excellent
good
health
and
spirits
and
am
not
yet
quite
fifty
is
a
time
for
all
things
even
the
bible
allows
that
the
doctor
shook
his
head
at
this
sad
misapplication
of
the
text
flam
went
away
pressing
us
all
to
dine
with
him
next
day
he
had
killed
a
fine
buck
and
he
assured
barlow
that
he
should
have
the
best
port
in
his
cellar
the
doctor
pleaded
want
of
time
and
the
rest
of
the
party
could
not
afford
a
day
out
of
the
few
which
remained
to
us
but
we
promised
to
call
on
him
he
nodded
kindly
at
barlow
saying
well
doctor
as
you
wo
come
to
the
buck
one
of
his
haunches
shall
come
to
you
so
tell
madam
to
expect
it
as
soon
as
he
had
left
the
room
we
all
joined
in
lamenting
that
the
blessings
of
health
and
strength
should
ever
be
produced
as
arguments
for
neglecting
to
secure
those
blessings
which
have
eternity
for
their
object
unhappy
man
said
barlow
little
does
he
think
that
he
is
if
possible
more
the
object
of
my
compassion
than
poor
tyrrel
tyrrel
it
is
true
is
lying
on
a
sick
probably
a
dying
bed
his
body
is
in
torture
his
mind
is
in
anguish
he
has
to
look
back
on
a
life
the
retrospect
of
which
can
afford
him
no
ray
of
comfort
but
he
his
misery
the
hand
of
god
is
upon
him
his
proud
heart
is
brought
low
his
is
subdued
his
high
imaginations
are
cast
down
his
abasement
of
soul
as
far
as
i
can
judge
is
sincere
he
abhors
himself
in
dust
and
ashes
he
sees
death
at
hand
he
feels
that
the
sting
of
death
is
sin
all
subterfuge
is
at
an
end
he
is
at
last
seeking
the
only
refuge
of
penitent
sinners
i
trust
on
right
grounds
his
state
is
indeed
perilous
in
the
extreme
yet
awful
as
it
is
he
it
he
will
not
open
his
eyes
on
the
eternal
world
in
a
state
of
delusion
but
what
shall
awaken
poor
flam
from
his
dream
of
security
his
high
health
his
unbroken
spirits
his
prosperous
circumstances
and
various
blessings
are
so
many
snares
to
him
he
thinks
that
shall
be
as
this
day
and
still
more
abundant
even
the
wretched
situation
of
his
dying
friend
though
it
awakens
compassion
awakens
not
compunction
nay
it
affords
matter
of
triumph
rather
than
of
humiliation
he
feeds
his
vanity
with
comparisons
from
which
he
contrives
to
extract
comfort
his
own
offenses
being
of
a
different
kind
instead
of
lamenting
them
he
glories
in
being
free
from
those
which
belong
to
an
opposite
cast
of
character
satisfied
that
he
has
not
the
vices
of
tyrrel
he
never
once
reflects
on
his
own
unrepented
sins
even
his
good
qualities
increase
his
danger
he
wraps
himself
up
in
that
constitutional
good
nature
which
being
partly
founded
on
vanity
and
strengthens
his
delusion
and
hardens
him
against
reproof
chapter
xlvi
in
conversing
with
stanley
on
my
happy
prospects
and
my
future
plans
after
having
referred
all
concerns
of
a
pecuniary
nature
to
be
settled
between
him
and
sir
john
belfield
i
ventured
to
entreat
that
he
would
crown
his
goodness
and
my
happiness
by
allowing
me
to
solicit
his
daughter
for
an
early
day
stanley
said
the
term
was
relative
but
he
was
afraid
that
he
should
hardly
consent
to
what
i
might
consider
even
as
a
late
one
in
parting
with
such
a
child
as
lucilla
added
he
some
weaning
time
must
be
allowed
to
the
tenderest
of
mothers
the
most
promising
marriage
and
surely
none
can
promise
more
happiness
than
that
to
which
we
are
looking
is
a
heavy
trial
to
fond
parents
to
have
trained
a
creature
with
anxious
fondness
in
hope
of
her
repaying
their
solicitude
hereafter
by
the
charms
of
her
society
and
then
as
soon
as
she
becomes
capable
of
being
a
friend
and
companion
to
lose
her
forever
is
such
a
trial
that
i
sometimes
wonder
at
the
seeming
impatience
of
parents
to
get
rid
of
a
treasure
of
which
they
best
know
the
value
the
sadness
which
attends
the
consummation
even
of
our
dearest
hopes
on
these
occasions
is
one
striking
instance
of
that
of
human
on
which
juvenal
and
johnson
have
so
beautifully
expatiated
a
little
delay
indeed
i
shall
require
from
motives
of
prudence
as
well
as
fondness
lucilla
will
not
be
nineteen
these
three
months
and
more
you
will
not
i
trust
think
me
unreasonable
if
i
say
that
neither
her
mother
nor
myself
can
consent
to
part
with
her
before
that
period
three
months
exclaimed
i
with
more
vehemence
than
politeness
three
months
it
is
impossible
it
is
very
possible
said
he
smiling
that
you
can
wait
and
very
certain
that
we
shall
not
consent
sooner
have
you
any
doubts
sir
said
i
have
you
any
objections
which
i
can
remove
and
which
being
removed
may
abridge
this
long
probation
none
said
he
kindly
but
i
consider
even
nineteen
as
a
very
early
age
too
early
indeed
were
not
my
mind
so
completely
at
rest
about
you
on
the
grand
points
of
religion
morals
and
temper
that
no
delay
could
i
trust
afford
me
additional
security
you
will
however
my
dear
charles
find
so
much
occupation
in
preparing
your
affairs
and
your
mind
for
so
important
a
change
that
you
will
not
find
the
time
of
absence
so
irksome
as
you
fancy
absence
sir
replied
i
what
then
do
you
intend
to
banish
me
no
replied
he
smiling
again
but
i
intend
to
send
you
a
sentence
indeed
which
in
this
dissipated
age
is
thought
the
worst
sort
of
exile
you
have
now
been
absent
six
or
seven
months
this
absence
has
been
hitherto
justifiable
it
is
time
to
return
to
your
affairs
to
your
duties
both
the
one
and
the
other
always
slide
into
some
disorder
by
a
too
long
separation
from
the
place
of
their
legitimate
exercise
your
steward
will
want
inspection
your
tenants
may
want
redress
your
poor
always
want
assistance
seeing
me
look
irresolute
i
must
i
find
added
he
with
the
kindest
look
and
voice
be
compelled
to
the
inhospitable
necessity
of
turning
you
out
of
doors
live
without
lucilla
three
months
said
i
allow
me
sir
at
least
to
remain
a
few
weeks
longer
at
the
grove
love
is
a
bad
calculator
replied
stanley
i
believe
he
never
learned
arithmetic
do
you
know
that
as
you
are
enjoined
a
three
month
banishment
that
the
sooner
you
go
the
sooner
you
will
return
and
that
however
long
your
stay
now
is
your
three
months
absence
will
still
remain
to
be
accomplished
to
speak
seriously
lucilla
sense
of
propriety
as
well
as
that
of
stanley
will
not
allow
you
to
remain
much
longer
under
the
same
roof
now
that
the
motive
will
become
so
notorious
besides
that
an
act
of
is
a
good
principle
to
set
out
upon
business
and
duties
will
fill
up
your
active
hours
and
an
intercourse
of
letters
with
her
you
so
reluctantly
quit
will
not
only
give
an
interest
to
your
leisure
but
put
you
both
still
more
completely
in
possession
of
each
other
character
i
will
set
out
sir
said
i
earnestly
in
order
to
begin
to
hasten
the
day
of
my
return
now
you
are
as
much
too
precipitate
on
the
other
side
replied
he
a
few
days
i
think
may
be
permitted
without
any
offense
to
delicacy
this
even
her
mother
pleads
for
with
what
excellence
will
this
blessed
union
give
me
an
alliance
replied
i
i
will
go
directly
and
thank
stanley
for
this
goodness
i
found
stanley
and
her
daughter
together
with
whom
i
had
a
long
and
interesting
conversation
they
took
no
small
pains
to
convince
my
judgment
that
my
departure
was
perfectly
proper
my
will
however
continued
rebellions
but
as
i
had
been
long
trained
to
the
habit
of
submitting
my
will
to
my
reason
i
acquiesced
though
not
without
murmuring
and
as
they
told
me
with
a
very
bad
grace
i
informed
stanley
of
an
intimation
i
had
received
from
sir
george
aston
of
his
attachment
to
ph
oe
be
and
of
his
mother
warm
approbation
of
his
choice
adding
that
he
alleged
her
extreme
youth
as
the
ground
of
his
deferring
to
express
his
hope
that
his
plea
might
one
day
be
received
with
favor
he
forgot
to
allege
his
own
youth
replied
she
which
is
a
reason
almost
equally
cogent
miss
stanley
and
i
agreed
that
a
connection
more
desirable
in
all
respects
could
not
be
expected
when
i
assure
you
replied
stanley
that
i
am
quite
of
your
opinion
you
will
think
me
inconsistent
if
i
add
that
i
earnestly
hope
such
a
proposal
will
not
be
made
by
sir
george
lest
his
precipitancy
should
hinder
the
future
accomplishment
of
a
wish
which
i
may
be
allowed
remotely
to
indulge
what
objection
said
i
can
stanley
possibly
make
to
such
a
proposal
except
that
his
daughter
is
too
young
i
see
replied
she
that
you
do
not
yet
completely
know
stanley
or
rather
you
do
not
know
all
that
he
has
done
for
the
aston
family
his
services
have
been
very
important
not
only
in
that
grand
point
which
you
and
i
think
the
most
momentous
but
he
has
also
very
successfully
exerted
himself
in
settling
lady
aston
worldly
affairs
which
were
in
the
utmost
disorder
the
large
estate
which
had
suffered
by
her
own
ignorance
of
business
and
the
dishonesty
of
a
steward
he
has
not
only
enabled
her
to
clear
but
put
her
in
the
way
greatly
to
improve
this
skill
and
kindness
in
worldly
things
so
raised
his
credit
in
the
eyes
of
the
guardian
young
sir
george
uncle
that
he
declared
he
should
never
again
be
so
afraid
of
religious
men
whom
he
had
always
understood
to
be
without
judgment
or
kindness
or
disinterestedness
now
added
stanley
do
you
perceive
that
not
only
the
purity
of
stanley
motives
but
religion
itself
would
suffer
should
we
be
forward
to
promote
this
connection
will
not
this
aston
say
that
sinister
designs
influenced
all
this
zeal
and
kindness
and
that
sir
george
estate
was
improved
with
an
eye
to
his
own
daughter
it
will
be
said
that
these
religious
people
always
know
what
they
are
about
that
when
they
seem
to
be
purely
serving
god
they
are
resolved
not
to
serve
him
for
nothing
but
always
keep
their
own
interest
in
view
should
sir
george
inclination
continue
and
his
principles
stand
the
siege
which
the
world
will
not
fail
to
lay
to
a
man
of
his
fortune
some
years
hence
when
he
is
complete
master
of
his
actions
his
character
formed
and
his
judgment
ripened
to
direct
his
choice
so
as
to
make
it
evident
to
the
world
that
it
was
not
the
effect
of
influence
this
connection
is
an
event
to
which
we
should
look
forward
with
much
pleasure
never
exclaimed
i
no
not
once
have
i
been
disappointed
in
my
expectation
of
consistency
in
stanley
character
o
my
beloved
parents
how
wise
was
your
injunction
that
i
should
make
the
test
of
true
it
is
thus
that
christians
should
always
keep
the
credit
of
religion
in
view
if
they
would
promote
its
interests
in
the
world
when
i
communicated
to
miss
stanley
my
conversation
with
father
and
read
over
with
her
the
letters
of
how
tenderly
did
she
weep
how
were
my
own
feelings
renewed
to
be
thus
assured
that
she
was
selected
for
their
son
by
my
deceased
parents
seemed
to
her
pious
mind
to
shed
a
sacredness
on
our
union
how
did
she
venerate
their
virtues
how
feelingly
regret
their
loss
before
i
left
the
country
i
did
not
omit
a
visit
of
civility
to
flam
the
young
ladies
as
sir
john
predicted
had
stepped
back
into
their
natural
character
and
natural
though
he
was
too
severe
when
he
added
that
their
hopes
in
assuming
the
other
were
now
at
an
end
they
both
asked
me
if
i
was
not
moped
to
death
at
the
grove
the
stanleys
they
said
were
of
people
but
quite
as
every
body
must
be
who
did
not
spend
half
the
year
in
london
miss
stanley
was
a
fine
girl
enough
but
knew
nothing
of
the
world
wanted
manner
which
two
or
three
winters
in
town
would
give
her
better
as
she
is
interrupted
flam
better
as
she
is
she
is
a
pattern
daughter
and
will
make
a
pattern
wife
mother
has
no
care
nor
trouble
i
wish
i
could
say
as
much
of
all
mothers
i
never
saw
a
bad
humor
or
a
bad
dinner
in
the
house
she
is
always
at
home
always
employed
always
in
spirits
and
always
in
temper
she
is
as
cheerful
as
if
she
had
no
religion
and
as
useful
as
if
she
could
not
spell
her
own
i
was
affected
with
this
generous
tribute
to
my
lucilla
virtues
and
when
he
wished
me
joy
as
he
cordially
shook
me
by
the
hand
i
could
not
forbear
saying
to
myself
why
will
not
this
man
go
to
heaven
i
next
paid
a
farewell
visit
to
and
carlton
and
to
the
amiable
family
at
aston
hall
and
to
barlow
how
rich
has
this
excursion
made
me
in
valuable
friendships
to
say
nothing
of
the
inestimable
connection
at
the
grove
i
did
not
forget
to
assure
barlow
that
if
any
thing
could
add
a
value
to
the
blessing
which
awaited
me
it
was
that
his
hand
would
consecrate
it
through
the
good
doctor
i
received
a
message
from
tyrrel
requesting
me
to
make
him
a
visit
of
charity
before
i
quitted
the
neighborhood
i
instantly
obeyed
the
summons
i
found
him
totally
changed
in
all
respects
a
body
wasted
by
disease
a
mind
apparently
full
of
contrition
and
penetrated
with
that
deep
humility
in
which
he
had
been
so
eminently
deficient
he
earnestly
intreated
my
prayers
adding
though
it
is
presumption
in
so
unworthy
a
being
as
i
am
to
suppose
his
intercession
may
be
heard
i
will
pray
for
a
blessing
on
your
happy
prospects
a
connection
with
such
a
family
is
itself
a
blessing
oh
that
my
nephew
had
been
worthy
of
it
it
is
to
recommend
that
poor
youth
to
your
friendship
that
i
invited
you
to
this
melancholy
visit
i
call
him
poor
because
i
have
neglected
to
enrich
his
mind
but
he
will
have
too
much
of
this
world
goods
may
he
employ
well
what
i
have
risked
my
soul
to
amass
counsel
him
dear
sir
admonish
him
recall
to
his
mind
his
dying
uncle
i
would
now
give
my
whole
estate
nay
i
would
live
upon
the
alms
i
have
refused
to
purchase
one
more
year
though
spent
in
pain
and
misery
that
i
might
prove
the
sincerity
of
my
repentance
be
to
ned
what
my
blessed
friend
stanley
would
have
been
to
me
but
my
pride
repelled
his
kindness
i
could
not
bear
his
superiority
i
turned
away
my
eyes
from
a
model
i
could
not
imitate
i
now
intreated
him
to
spare
himself
but
after
a
few
minutes
pause
he
proceeded
as
to
ned
i
trust
he
is
not
but
i
have
neither
furnished
his
mind
for
solitude
nor
fortified
his
heart
for
the
world
i
foolishly
thought
that
to
keep
him
ignorant
was
to
keep
him
safe
i
have
provided
for
him
the
snare
of
a
large
fortune
without
preparing
him
for
the
use
of
it
i
fell
into
an
error
not
uncommon
that
of
grudging
the
expenses
of
education
to
a
relation
for
whom
i
designed
my
estate
i
have
thus
fitted
him
for
a
companion
to
the
vulgar
and
a
prey
to
the
designing
i
thought
it
sufficient
to
keep
him
from
actual
vice
without
furnishing
him
with
arguments
to
combat
it
or
with
principles
to
abhor
it
here
the
poor
man
paused
for
want
of
breath
i
was
too
much
affected
to
speak
at
length
he
went
on
i
have
made
over
to
barlow
son
two
thousand
pounds
for
completing
his
education
i
have
also
given
two
thousand
pounds
apiece
to
the
two
elder
daughters
of
stanley
in
aid
of
their
charities
i
have
made
a
deed
of
gift
of
this
and
of
a
large
sum
for
charitable
purposes
at
the
discretion
of
my
executors
a
refusal
to
accept
it
will
greatly
distress
me
ned
still
will
have
too
much
left
unless
he
employs
it
to
better
purposes
than
i
have
done
though
deeply
moved
i
hardly
knew
what
to
reply
i
wished
to
give
him
comfort
but
distrusted
my
own
judgment
as
to
the
manner
i
promised
my
best
services
to
his
nephew
oh
good
young
man
cried
he
if
ever
you
are
tempted
to
forget
god
as
i
did
for
above
thirty
years
or
to
mock
him
by
an
outward
profession
as
i
have
lately
done
think
of
me
think
of
one
who
for
the
largest
portion
of
his
life
lived
as
if
there
were
no
god
and
who
since
he
has
made
a
profession
of
christianity
deceived
his
own
soul
no
less
by
the
religion
he
adopted
than
by
his
former
neglect
of
all
religion
my
delusion
was
this
i
did
not
choose
to
be
good
but
i
chose
to
be
saved
it
was
no
wonder
then
that
i
should
be
struck
with
a
religion
which
i
hoped
would
free
me
from
the
discipline
of
moral
rectitude
and
yet
deliver
me
from
the
punishment
of
having
neglected
it
will
god
accept
my
present
forced
submission
will
he
accept
a
penitence
of
which
i
may
have
no
time
to
prove
the
sincerity
tell
me
you
are
a
christian
i
was
much
distressed
i
thought
it
neither
modest
nor
prudent
for
me
to
give
a
decisive
answer
he
grasped
my
hand
then
said
he
you
think
my
case
hopeless
you
think
the
almighty
can
not
forgive
me
thus
pressed
i
ventured
to
say
to
doubt
his
will
to
pardon
and
his
power
to
save
would
as
it
appears
to
me
sir
be
a
greater
fault
than
any
you
have
committed
one
great
comfort
is
left
replied
he
the
mercy
i
have
abused
is
infinite
tell
stanley
i
now
believe
with
him
that
if
we
pretend
to
trust
in
god
we
must
be
governed
by
him
if
we
truly
believe
in
him
we
shall
obey
him
if
we
think
he
sent
his
son
to
save
sinners
we
shall
hate
sin
i
ventured
to
congratulate
him
on
his
frame
of
mind
and
seeing
him
quite
overcome
took
leave
of
him
with
a
heart
deeply
touched
with
this
salutary
scene
the
family
at
the
grove
were
greatly
moved
with
my
description
and
with
the
method
poor
tyrrel
had
found
out
of
eluding
the
refusal
of
his
executors
to
accept
of
legacies
the
day
fixed
for
my
departure
too
soon
arrived
i
took
a
most
affectionate
leave
of
and
stanley
and
a
very
tender
one
of
lucilla
who
gratified
my
affection
by
the
emotion
she
evidently
felt
and
my
delicacy
by
the
effort
she
made
to
conceal
it
ph
oe
be
wept
outright
the
children
all
hung
about
me
each
presenting
me
some
of
her
flowers
saying
they
had
nothing
else
to
give
me
and
assuring
me
that
rachel
should
be
no
loser
by
it
little
celia
was
clamorous
in
her
sorrow
when
she
saw
me
ascend
the
curricle
in
which
neither
she
nor
lucilla
was
to
have
a
place
i
took
the
sweet
child
up
into
the
carriage
placed
her
by
me
and
gently
drove
her
through
the
park
at
the
gate
of
which
i
consigned
her
to
the
arms
of
her
father
who
had
walked
by
the
side
of
the
carriage
in
order
to
carry
her
back
i
drove
off
enriched
with
his
prayers
and
blessings
which
seemed
to
insure
me
protection
though
this
separation
from
all
i
loved
threw
a
transient
sadness
around
me
i
had
abundant
matter
for
delightful
reflection
and
pious
gratitude
i
experienced
the
truth
of
ph
oe
be
remark
that
happiness
is
a
serious
thing
while
pleasure
manifests
itself
by
extravagant
gayety
exuberant
spirits
and
overt
acts
happiness
retreats
to
its
own
proper
region
the
heart
there
concentrating
its
feelings
it
contemplates
its
treasures
meditates
on
its
enjoyments
and
still
more
fondly
on
its
hopes
counts
up
its
mercies
and
feels
the
consummation
of
them
in
looking
to
the
fountain
from
whence
they
flow
feels
every
blessing
immeasurably
heightened
by
the
reflection
that
the
most
exquisite
human
pleasures
are
not
the
perfection
of
his
nature
but
only
a
gracious
earnest
a
bounteous
of
that
blessedness
which
is
without
measure
and
shall
be
without
end
chapter
xlvii
before
the
belfields
had
quitted
us
it
was
stipulated
that
we
should
with
submission
to
the
will
of
a
higher
power
all
meet
for
six
weeks
every
other
summer
at
stanley
grove
and
pass
a
month
together
every
intermediate
year
either
at
the
priory
or
at
beechwood
i
passed
through
london
and
spent
three
days
in
my
friends
having
kindly
postponed
their
departure
for
the
country
on
my
account
lady
belfield
voluntarily
undertook
whatever
was
necessary
for
the
internal
decoration
of
the
priory
while
sir
john
took
on
himself
the
friendly
office
of
arranging
for
me
all
preliminaries
with
stanley
whose
largeness
of
heart
and
extreme
disinterestedness
i
knew
i
durst
not
trust
without
some
such
check
as
i
placed
in
the
hands
of
our
common
friend
as
soon
as
all
personal
concerns
were
adjusted
lady
belfield
said
i
have
something
to
communicate
in
which
i
am
persuaded
you
will
take
a
lively
interest
on
my
return
to
town
i
found
among
my
visiting
tickets
several
of
lady
melbury
the
porter
told
me
she
had
called
every
day
for
the
last
week
and
seemed
very
impatient
for
my
return
finding
she
was
still
in
town
i
went
to
her
immediately
she
was
not
at
home
but
came
to
me
within
an
hour
she
expressed
great
joy
at
seeing
me
she
looked
more
beautiful
than
ever
at
least
the
blush
of
conscious
shame
which
mingled
with
her
usual
sweetness
rendered
her
more
interesting
she
was
at
a
loss
how
to
begin
with
a
perplexed
air
she
said
did
you
stay
so
long
i
have
sadly
wanted
you
where
is
sir
john
i
have
wanted
counselors
comforters
friends
i
have
never
had
a
friend
i
was
affected
at
an
opening
so
unexpected
sir
john
came
in
this
increased
her
confusion
at
length
after
the
usual
compliments
she
thus
addressed
him
am
determined
to
conquer
this
false
shame
there
is
not
a
worse
symptom
in
human
nature
than
that
we
blush
to
own
what
we
have
not
been
afraid
to
do
from
you
sir
john
i
heard
the
first
remonstrance
which
ever
reached
my
ears
you
ought
to
be
informed
of
its
effect
you
can
not
have
forgotten
our
conversation
in
my
coach
after
we
had
quitted
the
scene
which
filled
you
with
contempt
for
me
and
me
with
anguish
for
the
part
i
had
acted
you
reasonably
supposed
that
my
remorse
would
last
no
longer
than
the
scene
which
had
inspired
it
you
left
me
alone
my
lord
dined
abroad
i
was
abandoned
to
all
the
horrors
of
solitude
i
wanted
somebody
to
keep
me
from
myself
stokes
dying
her
husband
dead
the
sweet
pining
for
want
and
i
the
cause
of
all
the
whole
view
presented
such
a
complication
of
misery
to
my
mind
and
of
guilt
to
my
heart
as
made
me
unsupportable
to
myself
was
saturday
i
was
of
course
engaged
to
the
opera
i
was
utterly
unfit
to
go
but
wanted
courage
to
frame
an
excuse
fortunately
lady
bell
finley
whom
i
had
promised
to
chaperon
sent
to
excuse
herself
this
set
my
person
at
liberty
but
left
my
mind
upon
the
rack
though
i
should
have
rejoiced
in
the
company
even
of
my
own
chambermaid
so
much
did
i
dread
being
left
to
my
own
thoughts
yet
i
resolved
to
let
no
one
in
that
night
i
had
scarcely
passed
a
single
evening
out
of
the
giddy
circle
for
several
years
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
was
driven
to
look
into
myself
i
took
a
retrospect
of
my
past
conduct
a
confused
and
imperfect
one
indeed
this
review
aggravated
my
distress
still
i
pursued
my
distracting
not
for
millions
would
i
pass
such
another
night
had
done
as
wrong
things
before
but
they
had
never
been
thus
brought
home
to
me
my
extravagance
must
have
made
others
suffer
but
their
sufferings
had
not
been
placed
before
my
eyes
what
was
not
seen
i
had
hoped
might
not
be
true
i
had
indeed
heard
distant
reports
of
the
consequences
of
my
thoughtless
expense
but
they
might
be
invented
they
might
be
exaggerated
at
the
i
the
ruin
i
had
made
i
the
fruits
of
my
unfeeling
vanity
i
the
calamities
i
had
caused
o
how
much
mischief
would
such
actual
observation
prevent
i
was
alone
i
had
no
dependant
to
qualify
the
deed
no
sycophant
to
divert
my
attention
to
more
soothing
objects
though
sir
john
honest
expostulation
had
touched
me
to
the
quick
yet
i
confess
had
i
found
any
of
my
coterie
at
home
had
i
gone
to
the
opera
had
a
joyous
supper
succeeded
all
together
would
have
quite
obliterated
the
late
mortifying
scene
i
should
as
i
have
often
done
before
have
soon
lost
all
sense
of
the
stokes
misery
and
of
my
own
crime
here
pursued
lady
belfield
the
sweet
creature
looked
so
contrite
that
sir
john
and
i
were
both
deeply
affected
are
not
accustomed
sir
john
resumed
she
with
a
faint
smile
the
office
of
a
confessor
nor
i
to
that
of
a
penitent
but
i
make
it
a
test
to
myself
of
my
own
sincerity
to
tell
you
the
whole
truth
wandered
from
room
to
room
fancying
i
should
be
more
at
ease
in
any
other
than
that
in
which
i
was
i
envied
the
starving
tenant
of
the
meanest
garret
i
envied
stokes
herself
both
might
have
pitied
the
pangs
which
rent
my
heart
as
i
roamed
through
the
decorated
apartments
of
our
spacious
house
in
the
gayest
part
of
london
i
felt
the
dreariness
of
a
desert
surrounded
with
magnificence
i
endured
a
sense
of
want
and
woe
of
which
a
blameless
beggar
can
form
no
idea
went
into
the
library
i
took
up
a
book
which
my
lord
had
left
on
the
table
it
was
a
translation
from
a
roman
classic
i
opened
it
at
the
speech
of
the
tragedian
to
pompey
time
will
come
that
thou
shalt
mourn
deeply
because
thou
didst
not
mourn
sooner
i
was
struck
to
the
heart
a
pagan
said
i
forcibly
reprove
me
and
shall
i
neglect
to
search
for
truth
at
the
fountain
knew
my
lord
would
not
come
home
from
his
club
till
the
morning
the
struggle
in
my
soul
between
principle
and
pride
was
severe
but
after
a
bitter
conflict
i
resolved
to
employ
the
night
in
writing
him
a
long
letter
in
it
i
ingenuously
confessed
the
whole
state
of
my
mind
and
what
had
occasioned
it
i
implored
his
permission
for
my
setting
out
next
morning
for
melbury
castle
i
entreated
him
to
prevail
on
his
excellent
aunt
lady
jane
whom
i
had
so
shamefully
slighted
to
accompany
me
i
knew
she
was
a
character
of
that
singular
class
who
would
be
glad
to
revenge
herself
for
any
by
doing
me
a
service
her
company
would
be
at
once
a
pledge
to
my
lord
of
the
purity
of
my
intentions
and
to
myself
a
security
against
falling
into
worse
society
i
assured
him
that
i
had
no
safeguard
but
in
flight
an
additional
reason
which
i
alleged
for
my
absence
was
that
as
i
had
promised
to
give
a
grand
masquerade
in
a
fortnight
the
evading
this
expense
would
nearly
enable
me
to
discharge
the
debt
which
sat
so
heavy
on
my
conscience
received
a
note
from
him
as
soon
as
he
came
home
with
his
usual
complaisance
he
complied
with
my
request
with
his
usual
nonchalance
he
neither
troubled
me
with
reproaches
nor
comforted
me
with
approbation
he
knew
that
lady
jane
usually
rose
about
the
hour
he
came
home
from
james
street
he
obligingly
went
to
her
at
once
i
had
not
been
in
bed
he
came
to
my
and
informed
me
that
his
aunt
had
consented
at
the
first
word
i
expressed
my
gratitude
to
them
both
saying
that
i
was
ready
to
set
out
that
very
day
must
wait
till
said
he
is
no
accounting
for
the
oddities
of
some
people
lady
jane
told
me
she
could
not
possibly
travel
on
a
sunday
i
wondered
where
was
the
impossibility
sunday
i
assured
her
was
the
only
day
for
traveling
in
comfort
as
the
road
was
not
obstructed
by
wagons
and
carts
she
replied
with
a
gravity
which
made
me
laugh
she
should
be
ashamed
to
think
that
a
person
of
her
rank
and
education
should
be
indebted
for
her
being
able
to
trample
with
more
convenience
on
a
divine
law
to
the
piety
of
the
vulgar
who
durst
not
violate
it
did
you
ever
hear
any
thing
so
whimsical
matilda
i
said
nothing
but
my
heart
smote
me
never
will
i
repeat
this
offense
the
monday
we
set
out
i
had
kept
close
the
preceding
day
under
pretense
of
illness
this
i
also
assigned
as
an
excuse
in
the
cards
sent
to
my
invited
guests
pleading
the
necessity
of
going
into
the
country
for
change
of
air
shall
i
own
i
dreaded
being
shut
up
in
a
barouche
and
still
more
in
the
lonely
castle
with
lady
jane
i
looked
for
nothing
every
moment
but
thorns
and
briars
of
reproof
but
i
soon
found
that
the
woman
whom
i
thought
was
a
methodist
was
a
most
entertaining
companion
instead
of
austerity
in
her
looks
and
reproach
in
her
language
i
found
nothing
but
kindness
and
affection
vivacity
and
elegance
while
she
soothed
my
sorrows
she
strengthened
my
better
purposes
her
conversation
gradually
revived
in
my
mind
tastes
and
principles
which
had
been
early
sown
in
it
but
which
the
world
seemed
completely
to
have
eradicated
the
neighborhood
of
the
castle
lady
jane
carried
me
to
visit
the
abodes
of
poverty
and
sickness
i
envied
her
large
but
discriminating
liberality
and
the
means
she
had
of
gratifying
it
while
i
shed
tears
at
the
remembrance
of
my
own
squandered
thousands
i
had
never
been
but
i
had
always
given
to
importunity
rather
than
to
want
or
merit
i
blushed
that
while
i
had
been
absurdly
profuse
to
cases
of
which
i
knew
nothing
my
own
village
had
been
perishing
with
a
contagious
sickness
i
amused
myself
with
drawing
my
aunt
often
read
to
me
some
rationally
entertaining
book
occasionally
introducing
religious
reading
and
discourse
with
a
wisdom
and
moderation
which
increased
the
effect
of
both
knowing
my
natural
levity
and
wretched
habits
she
generally
waited
till
the
proposal
came
from
myself
at
first
when
i
suggested
it
it
was
to
please
her
at
length
i
began
to
find
a
degree
of
pleasure
in
it
myself
will
say
i
have
not
quite
lost
my
romance
a
thought
struck
me
that
the
first
use
i
made
of
my
pencil
should
serve
to
perpetuate
at
least
one
of
my
offenses
you
know
i
do
not
execute
portraits
badly
with
a
little
aid
from
fancy
which
i
thought
made
it
allowable
to
bring
separate
circumstances
into
one
piece
i
composed
a
picture
it
consisted
of
a
detached
figure
in
the
background
of
poor
stokes
seen
through
the
grate
of
his
prison
on
a
bed
of
straw
and
a
group
composed
of
his
wife
in
the
act
of
expiring
fanny
bending
over
a
wreath
of
roses
withered
with
the
tears
she
was
shedding
and
myself
in
the
horrors
in
which
you
saw
me
spectatress
of
the
mischief
i
had
made
i
go
this
picture
shall
always
be
my
companion
it
hangs
in
my
closet
my
dear
friends
added
she
with
a
look
of
infinite
sweetness
i
am
tempted
to
contract
a
debt
or
to
give
in
to
any
act
of
vanity
or
dissipation
which
may
lead
to
debt
if
after
having
looked
on
this
picture
i
can
pursue
the
project
renounce
me
cast
me
off
forever
know
lady
jane
vein
of
humor
one
day
as
we
were
conversing
together
i
confessed
that
at
the
very
time
i
was
the
object
of
general
notice
and
my
gayety
the
theme
of
general
envy
i
had
never
known
happiness
do
not
wonder
at
it
said
she
who
greedily
pursue
admiration
would
be
ashamed
to
sit
down
with
so
quiet
a
thing
as
happiness
dear
lady
jane
said
i
me
counsel
me
instruct
me
you
have
been
too
lenient
too
forbearing
said
she
with
a
cheerful
tone
you
appoint
me
your
physician
as
you
disclose
your
case
and
ask
relief
i
will
give
you
a
prescription
which
though
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
will
i
am
certain
go
a
great
way
toward
curing
you
as
you
are
barely
your
disease
i
trust
is
not
inveterate
if
you
will
be
an
obedient
patient
i
will
answer
for
your
recovery
assured
her
of
my
willing
adoption
of
any
remedy
she
might
prescribe
as
i
was
certain
she
would
consider
my
weakness
and
adapt
her
treatment
not
so
much
to
what
my
case
absolutely
required
as
to
what
my
strength
was
able
to
bear
then
said
she
pray
observe
i
am
no
quack
i
do
not
undertake
to
restore
you
instantaneously
though
my
medicine
will
work
surely
it
will
work
slowly
you
know
added
she
smiling
success
of
all
alteratives
depends
on
the
punctuality
with
which
they
are
taken
and
the
constancy
with
which
they
are
followed
up
mine
must
be
taken
two
or
three
times
a
day
in
small
quantities
at
first
the
dose
to
be
enlarged
as
you
are
able
to
bear
it
i
can
safely
assert
with
the
advertising
doctors
that
it
may
be
used
full
or
fasting
in
all
weathers
and
all
seasons
but
i
can
not
add
with
them
that
requires
no
grew
impatient
and
begged
she
would
come
to
the
point
matilda
said
she
i
must
first
look
into
my
for
fear
i
should
mistake
any
of
my
ingredients
this
book
said
she
opening
it
written
by
no
charlatan
contains
a
cure
for
all
diseases
it
exhibits
not
only
general
directions
but
specified
cases
turning
over
the
leaves
as
she
was
speaking
she
at
length
stopped
saying
is
your
case
my
dear
or
rather
your
remedy
she
then
read
very
deliberately
with
your
own
heart
and
in
your
chamber
and
be
still
now
found
her
grand
was
the
bible
i
rose
and
embraced
her
dear
aunt
said
i
with
me
whatever
you
please
i
will
be
all
obedience
i
pledge
myself
to
take
your
alterative
regularly
constantly
do
not
spare
me
speak
your
whole
mind
dear
matilda
said
she
since
your
marriage
your
life
has
been
one
continued
opposition
to
your
feelings
you
have
lived
as
much
below
your
understanding
as
your
principles
your
conduct
has
been
a
system
of
contradictions
you
have
believed
in
christianity
and
acted
in
direct
violation
of
its
precepts
you
knew
that
there
was
a
day
of
future
reckoning
and
yet
neglected
to
prepare
for
it
with
a
heart
full
of
tenderness
you
have
been
guilty
of
repeated
acts
of
cruelty
you
have
been
faithful
to
your
husband
without
making
him
respectable
or
happy
you
have
been
virtuous
without
the
reputation
or
the
peace
which
belongs
to
virtue
you
have
been
charitable
without
doing
good
and
affectionate
without
having
ever
made
a
friend
you
have
wasted
those
attentions
on
the
worthless
which
the
worthy
would
have
delighted
to
receive
and
those
talents
on
the
frivolous
which
would
have
been
cherished
by
the
enlightened
you
have
defeated
the
use
of
a
fine
understanding
by
the
want
of
common
prudence
and
robbed
society
of
the
example
of
your
good
qualities
by
your
total
inability
to
resist
and
oppose
inconsideration
and
vanity
have
been
the
joint
cause
of
your
malady
at
your
age
i
trust
it
is
not
incurable
as
you
have
caught
it
by
keeping
infected
company
there
is
no
possible
mode
of
cure
but
by
avoiding
the
contagious
air
they
breathe
you
have
performed
your
quarantine
with
admirable
patience
beware
my
dearest
niece
of
returning
to
the
scene
where
the
plague
rages
till
your
antidote
has
taken
its
full
effect
will
return
to
it
my
dear
lady
jane
cried
i
throwing
myself
into
her
arms
do
not
mean
that
i
will
never
return
to
town
my
duty
to
my
lord
requires
me
to
be
where
he
is
or
where
he
wishes
me
to
be
my
residence
will
be
the
same
but
my
society
shall
be
changed
please
me
entirely
replied
she
resorting
to
religion
take
care
that
you
do
not
dishonor
it
never
plead
your
piety
to
god
as
an
apology
for
your
neglect
of
the
relative
duties
if
the
one
is
soundly
adopted
the
others
will
be
correctly
performed
there
are
those
who
would
delight
to
throw
such
a
stigma
on
real
christianity
as
to
be
able
to
report
that
it
had
extinguished
your
affections
and
soured
your
temper
disappoint
them
my
sweet
niece
while
you
serve
your
maker
more
fervently
you
must
be
still
more
patient
with
your
husband
but
while
you
bear
with
his
faults
you
must
not
connive
at
them
if
you
are
in
earnest
you
must
expect
some
trials
he
who
prepares
these
trials
for
you
will
support
you
under
them
will
carry
you
through
them
will
make
them
instruments
of
his
glory
and
of
your
own
eternal
happiness
melbury
complaisance
to
my
wishes
replied
i
been
unbounded
as
he
never
controlled
my
actions
when
they
required
control
i
trust
he
will
be
equally
indulgent
now
they
will
be
less
censurable
alas
we
have
too
little
interfered
with
each
other
concerns
we
have
lived
too
much
asunder
who
knows
but
i
may
recall
him
my
tears
would
not
let
me
go
on
will
they
now
added
she
wiping
her
fine
eyes
sir
john
and
i
were
too
much
touched
to
attempt
to
answer
her
at
length
she
proceeded
adhering
to
lady
jane
directions
i
have
begun
to
get
acquainted
with
my
own
heart
little
did
i
suspect
the
evil
that
was
in
it
yet
i
am
led
to
believe
that
the
incessant
whirl
in
which
i
have
lived
my
total
want
of
leisure
for
reflection
my
excessive
vanity
and
complete
inconsiderateness
are
of
themselves
causes
adequate
to
any
effects
which
the
grossest
vices
would
have
produced
week
my
lord
made
us
a
visit
at
the
castle
i
gave
him
a
warm
reception
but
he
seemed
rather
surprised
at
the
cold
one
which
i
gave
to
a
large
cargo
of
new
french
novels
and
german
plays
which
he
had
been
so
good
as
to
bring
me
i
did
not
venture
to
tell
him
that
i
had
changed
my
course
of
study
lady
jane
charged
me
to
avoid
giving
him
the
least
disgust
by
any
unusual
gravity
in
my
looks
or
severity
in
my
conversation
i
exerted
myself
to
such
good
purpose
that
he
declared
he
wanted
neither
cards
nor
company
i
tried
to
let
him
see
by
my
change
of
habits
rather
than
by
dry
documents
or
cold
remonstrances
the
alteration
which
had
taken
place
in
my
sentiments
he
was
pleased
to
see
me
blooming
and
cheerful
he
told
lady
jane
he
never
saw
me
so
pleasant
he
did
not
know
i
was
so
agreeable
a
woman
and
was
glad
he
had
this
opportunity
of
getting
acquainted
with
me
as
he
has
great
expectations
from
her
he
was
delighted
at
the
friendship
which
subsisted
between
us
brought
us
up
to
town
as
it
was
now
empty
the
terrors
of
the
masquerade
no
longer
hung
over
me
and
i
cheerfully
complied
with
his
wishes
i
drove
immediately
to
stokes
with
such
a
portion
of
my
debt
as
my
retirement
had
enabled
me
to
save
i
feasted
all
the
way
on
the
joy
i
should
have
in
surprising
her
with
this
two
hundred
pounds
how
severe
but
how
just
was
my
punishment
when
on
knocking
at
the
door
i
found
she
had
been
dead
these
two
months
no
one
could
tell
what
was
become
of
her
daughter
this
shock
operated
almost
as
powerfully
on
my
feelings
as
the
first
had
done
but
if
it
augmented
my
it
confirmed
my
good
resolutions
my
present
concern
is
how
to
discover
the
sweet
girl
whom
alas
i
have
helped
to
deprive
of
both
her
parents
here
i
interrupted
her
continued
lady
belfield
saying
have
not
far
to
seek
fanny
stokes
is
in
this
house
she
is
appointed
governess
to
our
children
poor
lady
melbury
joy
was
excessive
at
this
intelligence
and
she
proceeded
a
too
sudden
return
to
the
world
might
not
weaken
my
better
purposes
i
was
preparing
to
request
my
lord
permission
to
go
back
to
the
castle
when
he
prevented
me
by
telling
me
that
he
had
had
an
earnest
desire
to
make
a
visit
to
the
brave
patriots
in
spain
and
to
pass
the
winter
among
them
but
feared
he
must
give
it
up
as
the
state
of
the
continent
rendered
it
impossible
for
me
to
accompany
him
filled
my
heart
with
joy
i
encouraged
him
to
make
the
voyage
assured
him
i
would
live
under
lady
jane
observation
and
that
i
would
pass
the
whole
winter
in
the
country
you
shall
pass
it
with
us
at
beechwood
my
dear
lady
melbury
cried
sir
john
and
i
both
at
once
will
strengthen
each
other
in
every
virtuous
purpose
we
shall
rejoice
in
lady
jane
company
she
joyfully
accepted
the
proposal
not
doubting
her
lord
consent
and
kindly
said
that
she
should
be
doubly
happy
in
a
society
at
once
so
rational
and
so
elegant
it
was
settled
that
she
should
spend
with
us
the
three
months
that
fanny
stokes
and
little
caroline
are
to
pass
at
stanley
grove
she
desired
to
see
fanny
to
whom
she
behaved
with
great
tenderness
she
paid
her
the
two
hundred
pounds
assuring
her
she
had
no
doubt
of
being
able
to
discharge
the
whole
debt
in
the
spring
i
received
a
note
from
her
the
next
day
informing
me
of
her
cheerful
concurrence
as
well
as
that
of
lady
jane
she
added
that
when
she
went
up
to
dress
she
had
found
on
her
toilette
her
diamond
necklace
which
her
dear
aunt
had
redeemed
and
restored
to
her
as
a
proof
of
her
confidence
and
affection
as
lady
melbury
has
forever
abolished
her
coterie
i
have
the
most
sanguine
hope
of
her
perseverance
all
her
promises
would
have
gone
for
nothing
without
this
practical
pledge
of
her
sincerity
when
lady
belfield
had
finished
her
little
tale
i
expressed
in
the
strongest
terms
the
delight
i
felt
at
the
happy
change
in
this
charming
woman
i
could
not
forbear
observing
to
sir
john
that
as
lady
melbury
had
been
the
glass
of
fashion
while
her
conduct
was
wrong
i
hoped
she
would
not
lose
all
her
influence
by
its
becoming
right
i
added
with
a
smile
in
that
case
i
shall
rejoice
to
see
the
fine
ladies
turn
their
talent
for
drawing
to
the
same
moral
account
with
this
fair
penitent
such
a
record
of
their
faults
as
she
has
had
the
courage
to
make
of
hers
hanging
in
their
closets
and
perpetually
staring
them
in
the
face
would
be
no
unlikely
means
to
prevent
a
repetition
especially
if
the
picture
is
to
be
as
visible
as
the
fault
had
been
chapter
xlviii
the
next
morning
i
resumed
my
journey
northward
and
on
the
fourth
day
i
reached
the
seat
of
my
ancestors
the
distant
view
of
the
priory
excited
strong
but
mingled
emotions
in
my
bosom
the
tender
sorrow
for
the
loss
of
the
beloved
society
i
had
once
enjoyed
under
its
roof
was
a
salutary
check
to
the
abundant
joy
arising
from
the
anticipation
of
the
blessing
which
awaited
me
there
my
mind
was
divided
between
the
two
conflicting
sentiments
that
i
was
soon
to
be
in
possession
of
every
material
for
the
highest
happiness
and
that
the
highest
happiness
is
short
may
i
ever
live
under
the
influence
of
that
act
of
devout
gratitude
in
which
as
soon
as
i
entered
the
house
i
dedicated
the
whole
of
my
future
life
to
its
divine
author
solemnly
consecrating
to
his
service
my
time
my
talents
my
fortune
all
i
am
and
all
i
have
i
next
wrote
to
lucilla
with
whom
i
continued
to
maintain
a
regular
and
animated
correspondence
her
letters
gratify
my
taste
and
delight
my
heart
while
they
excite
me
to
every
thing
that
is
good
this
interchange
of
sentiment
sheds
a
ray
of
brightness
on
a
separation
which
every
day
is
diminishing
stanley
also
has
the
goodness
to
write
to
me
frequently
in
one
of
my
letters
to
him
i
ventured
to
ask
him
how
he
had
managed
to
produce
in
his
daughter
such
complete
satisfaction
in
his
sober
and
correct
habits
of
life
adding
that
her
conformity
was
so
cheerful
that
it
did
not
look
so
much
like
acquiescence
as
choice
i
received
from
stanley
the
answer
which
follows
stanley
grove
my
dear
charles
as
i
wish
to
put
you
in
possession
of
whatever
relates
to
the
mind
of
lucilla
i
will
devote
this
letter
to
answer
your
inquiries
respecting
her
cheerful
conformity
to
what
you
call
our
habits
of
life
and
her
indifference
to
those
pleasures
which
are
usually
thought
to
constitute
the
sole
happiness
of
young
women
of
a
certain
rank
stanley
and
i
are
not
so
unacquainted
with
human
nature
as
to
have
pretended
to
impose
on
her
understanding
by
attempting
to
breed
her
up
in
entire
ignorance
of
the
world
or
in
perfect
seclusion
from
it
she
often
accompanied
us
to
town
for
a
short
time
the
occasional
sight
of
london
and
the
frequent
enjoyment
of
the
best
society
dissipated
the
illusions
of
fancy
the
bright
colors
with
which
young
imagination
inflamed
by
ignorance
report
and
curiosity
invests
unknown
and
distant
objects
faded
under
actual
observation
complete
ignorance
and
complete
seclusion
form
no
security
from
the
dangers
incident
to
the
world
or
for
correct
conduct
at
a
distance
from
it
ignorance
may
be
the
safety
of
an
idiot
and
seclusion
the
security
of
a
nun
christian
parents
should
act
on
a
more
large
and
liberal
principle
or
what
is
the
use
of
observation
and
experience
the
french
women
of
fashion
under
the
old
regime
were
bred
in
convents
and
what
women
were
ever
more
licentious
than
many
of
them
as
soon
as
marriage
had
set
them
at
liberty
i
am
persuaded
that
the
formation
of
character
if
founded
on
ignorance
or
deceit
will
never
answer
as
to
lucilla
we
have
never
attempted
to
blind
her
judgment
we
have
never
thought
it
necessary
to
leave
her
understanding
out
of
the
question
while
we
were
forming
her
heart
we
have
never
told
her
that
the
world
is
a
scene
absolutely
destitute
of
pleasure
we
have
never
assured
her
that
there
is
no
amusement
in
the
diversions
which
we
disapprove
even
if
this
assurance
had
not
been
deceitful
it
would
have
been
vain
and
fruitless
we
can
not
totally
separate
her
from
the
society
of
those
who
frequent
them
who
find
their
happiness
in
them
and
whom
she
would
hear
speak
of
them
with
rapture
we
went
upon
other
grounds
we
accustomed
her
to
reflect
that
she
was
an
intellectual
creature
that
she
was
an
immortal
creature
that
she
was
a
christian
that
to
an
intellectual
being
diversions
must
always
be
subordinate
to
the
exercise
of
the
mental
faculties
that
to
an
immortal
being
born
to
higher
hopes
than
enjoyments
the
exercise
of
the
mental
faculties
must
be
subservient
to
religious
duties
that
in
the
practice
of
a
christian
is
the
the
specific
distinction
that
as
to
many
of
the
pleasures
which
the
world
pursues
christianity
requires
her
votaries
to
live
above
the
temptations
which
they
hold
out
she
requires
it
the
more
especially
because
christians
in
our
time
not
being
called
upon
to
make
great
and
trying
sacrifices
of
life
of
fortune
and
of
liberty
and
having
but
comparatively
small
occasions
to
evidence
their
sincerity
should
the
more
cheerfully
make
the
petty
but
daily
renunciation
of
those
pleasures
which
are
the
very
element
in
which
worldly
people
exist
we
have
not
misled
her
by
unfair
and
flattering
representations
of
the
christian
life
we
have
not
with
a
view
to
allure
her
to
embrace
it
on
false
pretenses
taught
her
that
when
religion
is
once
rooted
in
the
heart
the
remainder
of
life
is
uninterrupted
peace
and
unbroken
delight
that
all
shall
be
perpetually
smooth
hereafter
because
it
is
smooth
at
present
this
would
be
as
unfair
as
to
show
a
raw
recruit
the
splendors
of
a
parade
day
and
tell
him
it
was
actual
service
we
have
not
made
her
believe
that
the
established
christian
has
no
troubles
to
expect
no
vexations
to
fear
no
storms
to
encounter
we
have
not
attempted
to
cheat
her
into
religion
by
concealing
its
difficulties
its
trials
no
nor
its
unpopularity
we
have
been
always
aware
that
to
have
enforced
the
most
exalted
christian
principles
together
with
the
necessity
of
a
corresponding
practice
ever
so
often
and
so
strongly
would
have
been
worse
than
foolish
had
we
been
impressing
these
truths
one
part
of
the
day
and
had
on
the
other
part
been
living
ourselves
in
the
actual
enjoyment
of
the
very
things
against
which
we
were
guarding
her
my
dear
charles
if
we
would
talk
to
young
people
with
effect
we
must
by
the
habits
of
which
we
set
them
the
example
dispose
them
to
listen
or
our
documents
will
be
something
worse
than
fruitless
it
is
really
hard
upon
girls
to
be
tantalized
with
religious
lectures
while
they
are
at
the
same
time
tempted
to
every
thing
against
which
they
are
warned
while
the
whole
bent
and
bias
of
the
family
practice
are
diametrically
opposite
to
the
principles
inculcated
in
our
own
case
i
think
i
may
venture
to
affirm
that
the
plan
has
answered
we
endeavored
to
establish
a
principle
of
right
instead
of
unprofitable
invective
against
what
was
wrong
perhaps
there
can
scarcely
be
found
a
religious
family
in
which
so
few
anathemas
have
been
denounced
against
this
or
that
specific
diversion
as
in
ours
we
aimed
to
take
another
road
the
turn
of
mind
the
tendency
of
the
employment
the
force
of
the
practice
the
bent
of
the
conversation
the
spirit
of
amusement
have
all
leaned
to
the
contrary
direction
till
the
habits
are
gradually
worked
into
a
kind
of
nature
it
would
be
cruel
to
condemn
a
creature
to
a
retired
life
without
qualifying
her
for
retirement
next
to
religion
nothing
can
possibly
do
this
but
mental
cultivation
in
women
who
are
above
the
exercise
of
vulgar
employments
the
girl
who
possesses
only
the
worldly
acquirements
the
singer
and
the
dancer
when
condemned
to
retirement
may
reasonably
exclaim
with
milton
adam
when
looking
at
the
constellations
why
all
night
long
shine
these
wherefore
if
none
now
the
woman
who
derives
her
principles
from
the
bible
and
her
amusements
from
intellectual
sources
from
the
beauties
of
nature
and
from
active
employment
and
exercise
will
not
pant
for
she
is
no
clamorous
beggar
for
the
extorted
alms
of
admiration
she
lives
on
her
own
stock
her
resources
are
within
herself
she
possesses
the
truest
independence
she
does
not
wait
for
the
opinion
of
the
world
to
know
if
she
is
right
nor
the
applause
of
the
world
to
know
if
she
is
happy
too
many
religious
people
fancy
that
the
infectious
air
of
the
world
is
confined
to
the
or
the
and
that
when
you
have
escaped
from
these
you
are
got
out
of
the
reach
of
its
contagion
but
the
contagion
follows
wherever
there
is
a
human
heart
left
to
its
own
natural
impulse
and
though
i
allow
that
places
and
circumstances
greatly
contribute
to
augment
or
diminish
the
evil
and
that
a
prudent
christian
will
always
avoid
an
atmosphere
which
he
thinks
not
quite
wholesome
yet
whoever
lives
in
the
close
examination
of
his
own
heart
will
still
find
something
of
the
morbid
mischief
clinging
to
it
which
will
require
constant
watching
whatever
be
his
climate
or
his
company
i
have
known
pious
persons
who
would
on
no
account
allow
their
children
to
attend
places
of
gay
resort
who
were
yet
little
solicitous
to
extinguish
the
spirit
which
these
places
are
calculated
to
generate
and
nourish
this
is
rather
a
geographical
than
a
moral
distinction
it
is
thinking
more
of
the
place
than
of
the
temper
they
restrain
their
persons
but
are
not
careful
to
expel
from
their
hearts
the
dispositions
which
excite
the
appetite
and
form
the
very
essence
of
danger
a
young
creature
can
not
be
happy
who
spends
her
time
at
home
in
amusements
destined
for
exhibition
while
she
is
forbidden
to
be
exhibited
but
while
we
are
teaching
them
that
christianity
involves
a
heroic
that
it
requires
some
things
to
be
done
and
others
to
be
sacrificed
at
which
mere
people
of
the
world
revolt
that
it
directs
us
to
renounce
some
pursuits
because
they
are
wrong
and
others
because
they
are
trifling
we
should
at
the
same
time
let
them
see
and
feel
that
to
a
christian
the
region
of
enjoyment
is
not
so
narrow
and
circumscribed
is
not
so
barren
and
unproductive
nor
the
pleasures
it
produces
so
few
and
small
as
the
enemies
of
religion
would
insinuate
while
early
habits
of
are
giving
firmness
to
the
character
strengthening
the
texture
of
the
mind
and
hardening
it
against
ordinary
temptations
the
pleasures
and
employments
which
we
substitute
in
the
stead
of
those
we
banish
must
be
such
as
tend
to
raise
the
taste
to
invigorate
the
intellect
to
exalt
the
nature
and
enlarge
the
sphere
of
enjoyment
to
give
a
tone
to
the
mind
and
an
elevation
to
the
sentiments
which
shall
really
reduce
to
insignificance
the
pleasures
that
are
prohibited
in
our
own
instance
i
humbly
trust
that
through
the
divine
blessing
perseverance
has
been
its
own
reward
as
to
lucilla
i
firmly
believe
that
right
habits
are
now
so
rooted
and
the
relish
of
superior
pleasures
so
established
in
her
mind
that
had
she
the
whole
range
of
human
enjoyment
at
her
command
had
she
no
higher
consideration
no
fear
of
god
no
obedience
to
her
mother
and
me
which
forbade
the
ordinary
dissipations
she
would
voluntarily
renounce
them
from
a
full
persuasion
of
their
empty
worthless
unsatisfying
nature
and
from
a
superinduced
taste
for
higher
gratifications
i
am
as
far
from
intending
to
represent
my
daughter
as
a
faultless
creature
as
she
herself
is
from
wishing
to
be
so
represented
she
is
deeply
conscious
both
of
the
corruption
of
her
nature
and
the
deficiencies
of
her
life
this
consciousness
i
trust
will
continue
to
stimulate
her
vigilance
without
which
all
religion
will
decline
and
to
maintain
her
humility
without
which
all
religion
is
vain
my
dear
charles
a
rational
sense
of
felicity
lies
open
before
you
both
it
is
lawful
to
rejoice
in
the
fair
perspective
but
it
is
safe
to
rejoice
with
trembling
do
not
abandon
yourself
to
the
chimerical
hope
that
life
will
be
to
you
what
it
has
never
yet
been
to
any
man
a
scene
of
unmingled
delight
this
life
so
bright
in
prospect
will
have
its
sorrows
this
life
which
at
seems
to
stretch
itself
to
an
indefinite
length
will
have
an
end
may
its
sorrows
correct
its
illusions
may
its
close
be
the
entrance
on
a
life
which
shall
have
no
sorrows
and
no
end
i
will
not
say
how
frequently
we
talk
of
you
nor
how
much
we
miss
you
need
i
tell
you
that
the
person
who
says
least
on
the
subject
is
not
the
one
that
least
feels
your
absence
she
writes
by
this
post
adieu
my
dear
charles
i
am
with
great
truth
your
attached
friend
and
hope
before
christmas
to
subscribe
myself
your
affectionate
father
francis
stanley
delightful
hope
as
miss
stanley
when
that
blessed
event
takes
place
will
resign
her
name
i
shall
resume
mine
and
joyfully
renounce
forever
that
of
c
oe
lebs
the
end
