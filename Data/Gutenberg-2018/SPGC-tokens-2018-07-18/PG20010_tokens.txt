dozing
upon
the
top

the
calico
cat
i
peaslee
looked
more
complacent
than
ever
it
was
saturday
noon
and
solomon
had
just
returned
from
his
usual
morning
sojourn
he
had
taken
off
his
coat
and
was
washing
his
face
at
the
sink
while
his
wife
was
dishing
up
the
midday
meal
there
was
salt
codfish
soaked
fresh
and
stewed
in
milk
picked
up
as
the
phrase
goes
there
were
baked
potatoes
and
a
thin
pie
peaslee
did
not
believe
in
pampering
the
flesh
and
she
did
believe
in
saving
every
possible
cent
well
said
peaslee
as
they
sat
down
to
this
feast
i
guess
i
got
news
for
ye
his
wife
gazed
at
him
with
interest
are
ye
drawed
she
asked
got
the
notice
from
whitcomb
right
in
my
pocket
grand
juror
september
term
ai
a
week
off
the
utterance
was
caused
by
the
big
mouthfuls
of
codfish
and
potato
which
between
phrases
peaslee
conveyed
to
his
mouth
it
was
plain
to
see
that
he
was
greatly
pleased
with
his
new
dignity
what
do
they
give
ye
for
it
asked
his
wife
solomon
should
accept
no
office
which
did
not
bring
profit
two
dollars
a
day
and
mileage
said
peaslee
with
the
emphasis
of
one
who
knows
he
will
make
a
sensation
mileage
what
that
travelin
expenses
state
allows
ye
so
much
a
mile
i
get
eight
cents
for
goin
to
the
courthouse
ye
get
eight
cents
every
day
asked
his
wife
her
eyes
snapping
she
was
vague
about
the
duties
of
a
grand
juror
maybe
he
had
to
earn
his
two
dollars
but
she
had
exact
ideas
about
the
trouble
of
walking
to
get
eight
cents
for
that
was
being
paid
for
doing
nothing
at
all
and
she
was
much
astonished
at
the
idea
likely
now
ai
it
said
peaslee
with
masculine
scorn
state
do
waste
money
that
way
mileage
to
get
ye
there
take
ye
home
again
when
term
over
you
to
stay
round
whiles
humph
said
his
wife
disappointed
they
give
ye
two
dollars
a
day
she
hazarded
the
shot
just
for
settin
round
and
talkin
do
they
walkin
considerable
more
of
an
effort
for
most
folks
round
an
talkin
exclaimed
peaslee
so
indignantly
that
he
stopped
eating
for
a
moment
knife
and
fork
upright
in
his
rigid
scandalized
hands
while
he
gazed
at
his
thin
energetic
shrewish
little
wife
round
and
talkin
it
mighty
important
work
now
i
tell
ye
i
guess
there
would
be
much
law
and
order
if
it
for
the
grand
jury
they
do
take
none
but
men
o
jedgment
takes
gumption
i
tell
ye
ye
have
to
pay
money
to
get
that
kind
well
said
his
wife
with
the
air
of
one
who
concedes
an
unimportant
point
anyhow
it
good
pay
for
a
man
whose
time
worth
anythin
ai
worth
anythin
exclaimed
peaslee
in
hurt
tones
now
sarepty
ye
know
that
i
do
know
how
they
get
along
without
me
up
to
the
bank
they
got
a
pretty
good
idee
o
my
jedgment
mortgages
they
do
pass
any
without
my
say
so
peaslee
sniffed
i
seen
ye
in
the
bank
window
round
with
jim
bartlett
and
si
spooner
and
the
rest
of
the
paper
that
all
ever
see
ye
doin
must
be
wearin
on
ye
guess
ye
never
heard
what
was
said
did
ye
ca
hear
thinkin
i
guess
they
mighty
shreüd
up
to
the
bank
mighty
shreüd
they
had
finished
their
codfish
and
potato
and
peaslee
without
giving
much
attention
to
her
husband
testimony
to
the
business
acumen
of
his
banking
friends
and
incidentally
of
himself
pulled
the
pale
thin
pie
toward
her
and
cut
it
pass
up
your
plate
said
she
when
his
plate
was
again
in
place
before
him
peaslee
inserted
the
edge
of
his
knife
under
the
upper
crust
and
raised
it
so
that
he
could
get
a
better
view
of
its
contents
he
had
his
suspicions
of
that
pie
what
he
saw
confirmed
them
between
the
crusts
was
a
thin
soft
layer
of
some
brown
stuff
interspersed
with
spots
of
red
them
the
currants
we
had
for
supper
the
night
before
last
and
that
the
sauce
we
had
for
supper
last
night
he
announced
accurately
an
ye
know
how
i
like
a
proper
pie
i
ai
goin
to
waste
good
victuals
said
his
wife
with
decision
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
solomon
did
not
dare
make
any
further
protest
i
suppose
his
wife
said
picking
up
again
the
thread
of
her
thoughts
ye
have
to
wear
your
suit
all
the
time
to
the
grand
jury
i
expect
they
be
all
wore
out
at
the
end
that
take
off
something
you
be
careful
now
settin
awful
wearin
on
pants

a
chair
with
a
cushion
and
do

i
ai
goin
to
have

spendin
your
money
when
ye
can
just
as
well
come
home
where
ye
goin
now
peaslee
was
putting
on
his
coat
well
he
said
i
kind
thought
i
step
over
to
i
thought
mebbe
he
be
interested
goin
to
brag
are
ye
was
his
wife
remorseless
comment
much
good
it
do
ye
talkin
to
that
he
ai
so
pious
as
he
looks
if
all
stories
are
true
but
peaslee
was
already
outside
the
door
she
raised
her
voice
shrilly
you
be
back
now
them
chickens
has
got
to
be
fed
peaslee
sought
a
more
sympathetic
audience
being
drawn
for
the
grand
jury
had
greatly
flattered
his
vanity
for
it
encouraged
a
secret
ambition
which
he
had
long
held
to
get
into
public
life
service
on
the
grand
jury
might
lead
to
his
becoming
selectman
perhaps
justice
of
the
peace
perhaps
town
representative
from
ellmington
who
knew
what
else
he
looked
down
a
pleasant
vista
of
increasing
office
at
the
end
of
which
stood
the
state
capitol
he
could
be
senator
perhaps
and
he
began
planning
his
behavior
as
juror
the
dignified
bearing
the
utterances
the
shrewd
at
the
end
of
his
service
his
neighbors
would
know
him
for
a
man
of
solid
judgment
a
safe
man
to
be
intrusted
with
weighty
affairs
peaslee
was
years
old
he
had
a
comfortable
figure
a
round
face
and
blue
eyes
much
exaggerated
for
the
spectator
by
the
strong
lenses
of
a
pair
of
great
spectacles
these
with
his
gray
hair
gave
him
a
benevolence
of
aspect
which
somewhat
misrepresented
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
although
and
not
without
a
still
surviving
capacity
for
generous
impulse
he
was
only
less
near
than
his
wife
childishly
vain
he
bore
himself
with
an
air
of
not
without
its
charm
for
humorous
neighbors
they
said
that
they
guessed
he
thought
himself
some
punkins
some
punkins
most
people
admitted
him
to
be
although
how
much
of
his
money
and
how
much
of
his
shrewdness
was
really
his
wife
was
matter
of
debate
among
those
who
knew
him
best
at
any
rate
the
peaslees
had
made
money
a
few
years
before
they
had
sold
their
fat
farm
advantageously
and
had
bought
the
dignified
white
house
in
ellmington
in
which
they
have
just
been
seen
eating
a
dinner
which
looks
as
if
they
were
house
poor
that
they
were
not
they
had
thirty
thousand
dollars
in
the
local
bank
partly
invested
in
its
stock
in
ellmington
peaslee
was
less
lonely
and
through
peaslee
was
an
unsuspected
director
in
the
bank
and
a
shrewd
user
of
the
chances
for
profitable
investment
which
her
husband
association
with
the
bank
crowd
opened
to
her
as
for
peaslee
he
did
not
know
that
he
himself
was
not
the
business
head
of
the
house
and
his
garden
his
chickens
and
his
pleasant
loafing
in
the
bank
window
kept
him
contentedly
occupied
for
in
spite
of
her
shrewish
tongue
peaslee
had
tact
enough
to
let
her
husband
have
the
credit
for
her
business
acumen
i
goin
to
let
on
she
said
to
herself
that
he
ai
just
as
good
as
the
rest
of
she
had
her
pride
as
peaslee
stepped
along
the
straight
walk
which
divided
his
neat
lawn
and
opened
the
neat
gate
in
his
neat
white
fence
he
met
sam
barton
the
giant
who
was
constable
of
ellmington
sam
gave
him
a
smiling
how
are
ye
squire
as
he
passed
guess
he
heard
said
peaslee
to
himself
much
pleased
yet
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
greeting
was
not
different
from
that
which
sam
had
given
him
daily
for
the
past
three
years
once
on
the
sidewalk
peaslee
turned
to
the
right
toward
the
house
of
his
neighbor
edwards
edwards
was
a
younger
man
than
peaslee
perhaps
his
business
was
speculating
in
lumber
and
cattle
and
in
the
interest
of
this
he
was
constantly
passing
and
re
passing
the
canadian
border
which
was
not
far
from
ellmington
in
the
intervals
between
his
trips
he
was
much
at
home
he
was
a
stern
silent
secretive
man
and
simply
because
he
was
so
there
was
much
guessing
and
gossip
not
wholly
kind
about
his
affairs
peaslee
found
the
front
door
of
the
edwards
house
standing
open
in
the
trustful
village
fashion
and
with
neighborly
freedom
walked
in
without
ringing
he
turned
first
into
the
where
he
found
no
one
and
then
into
a
rear
room
opening
from
it
this
obviously
was
a
boy
den
on
the
table
in
the
centre
were
a
checkerboard
some
loose
string
a
handful
of
spruce
gum
some
scattered
marbles
a
broken
a
cap
a
an
old
bird
nest
a
a
copy
of
commentaries
open
and
a
latin
dictionary
also
open
in
a
corner
stood
a
in
its
cotton
case
along
the
wall
were
ranged
a
a
pair
of
rubber
boots
and
a
huge
wasp
nest
leaning
against
the
sill
of
the
open
window
was
a
shotgun
and
on
the
sill
itself
were
some
black
greasy
rags
and
a
small
bottle
of
oil
various
truths
might
be
inferred
from
the
disarray
one
was
that
edwards
was
generous
to
his
son
jim
and
another
was
that
there
was
no
edwards
further
it
might
be
easily
enough
guessed
that
jim
had
been
lured
from
the
study
of
latin
in
which
pretty
miss
ware
who
was
his
teacher
at
the
union
school
was
trying
to
interest
him
by
the
attractive
idea
of
oiling
his
and
that
something
still
more
attractive
perhaps
a
boy
with
crossed
fingers
for
it
was
not
too
late
for
swimming
had
lured
him
from
that
at
any
rate
jim
was
not
there
peaslee
still
bent
on
finding
edwards
moved
toward
the
open
window
but
he
could
see
no
signs
of
life
anywhere
none
of
the
household
was
however
far
away
jim
was
in
the
loft
of
the
barn
where
he
was
carefully
examining
a
barrel
of
early
apples
with
a
view
to
filling
his
pockets
with
the
best
the
housekeeper
had
merely
stepped
across
the
street
to
borrow
some
yeast
and
edwards
who
had
a
headache
was
lying
down
in
the
chamber
immediately
above
jim
den
peaslee
stood
and
gazed
he
eyed
in
turn
the
kitchen
ell
the
shed
and
the
barn
and
then
gazed
out
over
the
posy
garden
where
still
bloomed
a
few
late
flowers
of
which
he
recognized
only
the
chiny
asters
he
looked
toward
what
he
himself
would
have
called
the
sarce
garden
with
its
cabbages
turnips
rustling
and
drying
seeing
no
one
there
he
sent
his
gaze
to
the
distant
rows
of
apple
trees
bright
with
ripening
fruit
disappointed
he
was
about
to
turn
away
but
he
could
not
resist
taking
a
complacent
sweeping
view
of
his
own
adjoining
possessions
there
on
the
right
ran
the
long
line
of
his
own
dwelling
continued
by
the
board
fence
separating
his
garden
from
edwards
this
stood
up
gauntly
white
until
near
the
orchard
where
it
was
completely
hidden
by
the
high
feathery
stalks
of
the
by
a
row
of
great
sunflowers
now
heavy
and
bent
with
their
and
by
a
clump
of
lilac
bushes
as
his
eye
traveled
along
the
white
expanse
he
gave
a
quick
start
and
his
face
clouded
with
vexation
there
in
the
sun
prone
upon
the
top
of
the
fence
dozed
the
bane
of
his
life
calico
her
coat
was
made
up
of
patches
of
yellow
and
white
varied
with
a
black
stocking
on
her
right
hind
leg
and
a
large
round
black
spot
about
her
right
eye
which
gave
her
a
peculiarly
predatory
and
disreputable
appearance
solomon
had
disliked
her
at
sight
ever
since
he
had
bought
the
house
in
ellmington
he
had
been
trying
to
drive
her
from
the
premises
but
stay
away
she
would
not
not
all
the
missiles
in
existence
could
convince
her
that
his
house
was
not
a
desirable
place
of
abode
and
she
was
a
constant
vexation
and
annoyance
she
jumped
from
the
fence
plump
into
the
middle
of
newly
planted
she
filled
the
haymow
with
kittens
she
asked
all
her
friends
to
the
barn
where
she
gave
elaborate
musical
parties
at
hours
more
fashionably
late
than
were
tolerated
in
ellmington
whenever
she
had
indigestion
she
ate
off
the
tops
of
the
choicest
green
things
that
grew
in
the
garden
but
when
her
appetite
was
good
she
caught
and
devoured
his
young
chickens
moreover
when
at
bay
she
frightened
him
once
he
had
cornered
the
spitting
creature
in
a
stall
claws
out
tail
big
fur
all
on
end
she
had
leaped
straight
at
his
head
which
he
ducked
and
landing
squarely
upon
it
had
steadied
herself
there
for
a
moment
with
sharp
protruding
claws
thence
she
had
jumped
to
a
thence
to
a
beam
thence
to
the
mow
from
the
dusky
recesses
of
which
she
had
glared
at
him
with
big
green
menacing
eyes
not
since
that
experience
which
in
spite
of
his
soft
hat
had
left
certain
marks
upon
his
scalp
had
he
ever
attempted
to
catch
her
instead
he
had
borrowed
a
gun
and
a
dozen
times
had
fired
at
her
but
although
he
counted
himself
a
fair
shot
he
had
never
made
even
a
scant
bit
of
fur
fly
from
her
disreputable
back
and
now
he
knew
she
laughed
at
him
yes
laughed
at
him
for
she
had
more
than
human
intelligence
there
was
something
demoniac
in
her
cleverness
her
immunity
from
harm
her
prodigious
energy
her
malevolent
mischief
her
raillery
actually
he
had
grown
morbid
about
the
beast
he
had
a
superstitious
feeling
that
in
the
end
she
would
bring
him
bad
luck
how
he
hated
her
there
she
lay
with
eyes
shut
unsuspecting
comfortable
and
basked
in
the
warm
september
sunshine
here
at
his
hand
was
a
shotgun
the
chance
was
too
good
this
vagrant
this
outlaw
this
trespasser
this
thief
he
catalogued
her
misdeeds
in
his
mind
as
he
clanged
the
ramrod
down
the
barrels
to
see
if
the
piece
was
loaded
it
was
not
but
ammunition
was
at
hand
he
put
in
a
generous
charge
from
jim
and
rammed
it
home
with
a
paper
wad
he
grabbed
up
the
and
released
the
proper
charge
into
his
hand
he
was
disappointed
it
was
bird
shot
scattering
as
it
would
scatter
it
could
do
cat
no
harm
nevertheless
he
poured
the
pellets
into
the
barrel
as
he
rammed
home
the
paper
wad
on
top
of
these
his
eye
caught
the
marbles
lying
on
the
table
he
took
one
that
fitted
and
rammed
that
home
also
for
luck
he
placed
a
cap
lifted
the
gun
to
his
shoulder
and
fired
with
a
leap
which
sent
her
six
feet
into
the
air
the
calico
cat
landed
in
peaslee
almost
on
the
back
of
the
dignified
rooster
which
fled
with
a
startled
squawk
she
dodged
like
lightning
across
the
between
cackling
and
clattering
hens
went
up
the
walls
leaped
to
the
roof
paused
considered
began
to
reflect
that
she
had
been
shot
at
before
and
to
wonder
at
her
own
fright
stopped
and
sitting
down
on
the
ridgepole
looked
inquiringly
in
peaslee
direction
she
was
of
course
entirely
unharmed
but
other
matters
were
claiming
peaslee
attention
out
from
behind
the
screen
formed
by
the
asparagus
plumes
the
the
sunflowers
and
the
lilacs
all
of
which
grew
not
so
far
from
the
spot
on
the
fence
where
the
calico
cat
had
been
sitting
fell
a
man
solomon
had
a
mere
glimpse
standing
behind
taller
bushes
the
stranger
had
fallen
behind
lower
ones
and
only
while
his
falling
figure
was
describing
the
narrow
segment
of
a
circle
had
he
been
visible
but
the
glimpse
was
enough
peaslee
jaw
dropped
his
face
turned
white
but
the
next
moment
he
gave
a
great
sigh
of
relief
he
saw
the
man
rise
and
slip
into
cover
of
the
bushes
and
so
disappear
through
the
orchard
he
had
not
then
killed
the
fellow
relieved
of
that
fear
he
thought
of
himself
what
would
people
say
were
he
charged
with
firing
at
a
man
he
a
respectable
citizen
a
director
in
the
bank
a
grand
juror
they
must
not
know
he
silently
laid
the
gun
back
against
the
turned
with
infinite
care
and
tiptoed
quickly
back
into
the
into
the
hall
into
the
street
not
a
soul
was
visible
nevertheless
such
was
agitation
so
strongly
did
he
feel
the
need
of
silence
that
placing
a
shaking
hand
upon
the
fence
to
steady
himself
he
tiptoed
along
the
sidewalk
all
the
way
to
his
own
house
there
the
fear
of
his
wife
struck
him
he
was
in
no
condition
to
meet
that
lady
he
softly
entered
the
front
door
and
penetrated
to
the
dark
parlor
where
as
no
one
would
ever
enter
it
except
for
a
funeral
or
a
wedding
he
felt
safe
from
intrusion
there
he
sank
down
upon
the
slippery
horsehair
lounge
and
staring
helplessly
at
the
severe
portrait
of
peaslee
done
by
a
lugubrious
artist
in
crayon
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
and
tried
to
collect
his
scattered
faculties

he
breathed

meanwhile
at
the
edwards
house
life
had
grown
suddenly
interesting
when
the
report
of
the
gun
reached
jim
he
had
stopped
pawing
over
the
apple
barrel
and
was
sitting
on
the
upper
step
of
the
staircase
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
loft
slowly
munching
an
apple
and
thinking
jim
was
a
healthy
active
boy
with
no
more
sense
than
naturally
belongs
to
a
boy
of
fifteen
and
with
a
lively
imagination
which
had
been
most
unfortunately
overstimulated
without
a
mother
and
with
a
father
who
paid
him
scant
attention
he
read
whatever
he
liked
and
as
a
result
his
head
was
full
of
romantic
delightfully
kind
to
little
crippled
daughters
at
home
fierce
pirates
who
supported
aged
and
respectable
mothers
and
considerate
bandits
who
restored
valuable
watches
when
told
that
they
were
prized
on
account
of
tender
associations
his
imagination
had
been
still
further
fed
by
certain
local
legends
and
happenings
highly
colored
enough
to
excite
the
keenest
interest
ellmington
is
as
has
been
said
near
the
canadian
border
the
place
abounds
in
tales
of
smuggling
and
the
popular
gossip
as
gossip
everywhere
has
a
pleasing
way
of
doing
associates
the
names
of
the
most
respectable
and
unlikely
people
with
the
disreputable
ventures
of
the
smugglers
of
course
a
story
of
contraband
trade
is
the
more
striking
if
the
narrator
can
hint
that
the
judge
of
probate
or
the
most
stern
of
village
deacons
might
tell
a
good
deal
if
he
were
disposed
and
there
are
always
persons
ready
to
give
this
sort
of
interest
to
their
yarns
in
ellmington
lived
jake
farnum
an
marshal
and
an
incorrigible
liar
about
whom
gathered
the
boys
jim
among
them
to
hear
exciting
stories
of
chase
and
detection
exactly
as
boys
in
a
seaport
town
gather
about
an
old
sailor
to
hear
tales
of
pirates
and
buccaneers
and
jake
loved
to
hint
darkly
that
the
best
people
shared
in
the
illicit
traffic
with
it
all
jim
sense
of
right
and
wrong
was
in
a
fair
way
to
become
hopelessly
mixed
exactly
as
boys
at
the
seashore
are
prone
to
believe
that
a
pirate
is
on
the
whole
an
admirable
character
so
these
border
boys
and
especially
jim
had
come
to
feel
only
with
more
excuse
because
of
the
generally
indulgent
view
of
the
community
that
smuggling
is
an
occupation
in
which
any
one
may
engage
with
credit
and
which
is
much
more
interesting
than
most
now
it
is
not
likely
that
jim
father
a
stern
secretive
obviously
prosperous
man
with
an
intermittent
business
which
took
him
back
and
forth
across
the
border
could
in
all
this
gossip
escape
a
touch
of
suspicion
no
one
of
course
denied
that
he
really
did
deal
in
lumber
and
cattle
the
fact
was
obvious
but
there
were
hints
and
whispers
shrewd
shakings
of
the
head
and
more
than
one
guessed
that
all
profits
did
come
from
cattle
no
nor
lumber
neither
latterly
these
whispers
had
become
more
definite
pete
lamoury
a
whom
edwards
had
hired
as
a
drover
and
abruptly
discharged
was
spreading
stories
about
his
former
employer
which
made
blackbeard
the
pirate
seem
like
a
babe
by
comparison
pete
was
not
a
very
credible
witness
but
still
building
upon
a
suspicion
that
already
existed
he
succeeded
in
adding
something
to
its
substantiality
these
stories
had
come
to
jim
ears
and
jim
was
delighted
the
consideration
that
were
the
stories
true
his
father
was
a
criminal
did
not
occur
to
him
at
all
like
the
foolish
romantic
boy
he
was
he
was
simply
pleased
to
think
of
his
father
as
a
man
of
iron
determination
cool
wit
unshakable
courage
whom
no
deputy
sheriff
could
and
who
was
leading
a
life
full
of
excitement
and
danger
the
smuggler
king
the
only
thing
that
jim
regretted
was
that
his
father
did
not
let
him
share
in
these
exploits
he
knew
he
could
be
useful
but
his
father
manner
was
habitually
so
forbidding
that
jim
did
not
dare
hint
a
knowledge
of
these
probable
undertakings
much
less
any
desire
to
share
them
poor
edwards
he
loved
his
boy
but
did
not
in
the
least
know
how
to
show
it
silent
with
a
sternness
of
demeanor
which
he
was
unable
wholly
to
lay
aside
even
in
his
friendliest
moments
much
away
from
home
and
unable
to
meet
the
boy
on
his
own
level
when
he
was
there
deprived
of
the
wife
who
might
have
been
his
interpreter
he
had
no
way
of
becoming
acquainted
with
his
son
anxious
in
some
way
to
share
in
jim
life
he
took
the
clumsy
and
mistaken
method
of
letting
him
have
too
much
yet
if
jim
thus
unguided
and
overindulged
had
gone
astray
in
his
conduct
edwards
was
not
the
man
to
know
his
mistake
and
take
the
blame
he
had
in
him
a
rigidity
of
moral
judgment
a
dryness
of
mind
which
made
it
certain
that
if
jim
did
do
what
he
disapproved
he
would
visit
upon
him
a
punishment
at
once
severe
and
unsympathetic
the
man
air
of
cold
strength
excited
in
the
son
fear
as
well
as
admiration
his
reserve
kept
his
naturally
affectionate
boy
at
more
than
arm
length
poor
edwards
poor
jim
misunderstanding
between
them
was
as
sure
to
occur
as
the
rise
of
sun
pat
on
jim
speculations
about
his
father
stirring
deeds
the
gunshot
came
echoing
through
the
silent
barn
jim
ran
to
the
loft
door
and
looked
out
he
saw
smoke
curling
up
from
the
window
of
his
den
and
knew
that
it
was
his
own
gun
that
had
been
fired
back
in
the
room
a
vague
masculine
figure
moved
hastily
out
of
the
door
jim
looked
toward
the
orchard
and
caught
sight
of
another
man
disappearing
in
the
trees
he
was
wild
with
excitement
as
he
knew
that
his
father
was
the
only
person
in
the
house
he
was
sure
that
his
father
had
fired
the
shot
the
tales
that
he
had
heard
his
belief
in
his
father
life
of
adventure
made
him
conclude
that
here
was
some
smuggler
quarrel
so
vividly
did
the
notion
take
possession
of
his
inflamed
imagination
that
nothing
henceforth
could
shake
it
he
simply
what
had
happened
and
his
father
had
fled
leaving
all
the
evidences
of
his
shot
behind
him
jim
loyal
heart
bounded
here
he
could
help
he
turned
raced
across
the
loft
clattered
down
the
steep
cobwebby
stairs
slipped
through
the
shed
passage
through
the
kitchen
and
on
into
his
own
room
he
knew
what
to
do
nothing
must
show
that
the
gun
had
ever
been
used
he
set
feverishly
to
work
he
swabbed
out
the
weapon
and
hung
it
on
its
rack
over
the
mantel
he
tossed
the
rags
into
the
fireplace
and
covered
them
with
ashes
he
put
the
and
the
into
their
proper
drawer
then
he
pulled
a
chair
to
the
table
and
set
himself
to
a
pretended
study
of
cæsar
if
any
one
should
come
it
would
look
as
if
he
had
been
quietly
studying
all
the
morning
all
this
had
cost
considerable
for
of
course
he
boiled
with
curiosity
about
the
man
in
the
orchard
he
did
not
dare
to
go
out
there
but
now
stealthily
glancing
out
of
the
window
he
saw
his
father
returning
from
the
garden
with
long
strides
jim
understood
his
father
going
out
at
the
front
door
had
slipped
round
to
the
side
of
the
house
so
that
it
would
look
as
if
he
had
come
from
the
street
he
was
not
surprised
that
his
father
looked
stern
and
angry
that
fellow
must
have
done
something
mighty
mean
he
thought
to
make
his
father
shoot
and
he
admired
at
once
the
magnanimity
and
the
skill
which
had
merely
winged
the
man
as
he
supposed
by
way
presumably
of
teaching
him
a
lesson
then
struck
by
the
boldness
and
openness
of
his
father
return
to
the
house
jim
suddenly
felt
that
he
had
been
foolish
that
the
cleaning
of
the
gun
had
not
been
needed
what
man
would
dare
after
such
a
lesson
to
complain
against
his
father
edwards
walked
straight
into
jim
room
aroused
from
his
nap
by
the
shot
he
had
leaped
to
the
window
and
seen
the
man
fall
he
had
then
turned
and
run
downstairs
so
quickly
that
he
had
not
seen
the
fellow
and
crawl
into
the
bushes
and
having
reached
the
spot
he
was
much
relieved
if
somewhat
staggered
to
find
no
body
he
did
find
tracks
for
this
was
plowed
ground
but
they
told
him
nothing
of
the
wounded
man
except
that
he
had
left
in
a
hurry
on
a
pair
of
rather
large
feet
he
looked
about
for
a
while
and
then
started
toward
the
house
determined
to
have
an
explanation
with
jim
he
knew
jim
gun
by
the
sound
of
its
report
and
felt
no
doubt
that
the
boy
had
fired
the
shot
what
sort
of
culpable
accident
had
happened
suffering
still
with
the
splitting
headache
which
he
had
been
trying
to
sleep
off
angry
with
jim
for
his
carelessness
concerned
lest
the
man
were
really
injured
edwards
was
in
his
least
compromising
mood
how
did
it
happen
he
asked
without
preface
his
tones
were
harsh
and
he
fixed
jim
with
stern
eyes
how
did
it
happen
repeated
jim
in
pure
surprise
certainly
his
father
knew
much
better
than
he
how
it
had
happened
speak
out
said
edwards
impatiently
how
did
you
come
to
shoot
that
man
i
want
to
know
about
it
me
cried
jim
in
complete
bewilderment
i
i
have
shot
any
man
father
you
know
i
have
edwards
never
a
man
of
nice
observation
and
now
bewildered
with
anger
and
headache
took
his
son
genuine
astonishment
for
mere
pretense
and
subterfuge
were
not
the
facts
plain
i
do
want
any
nonsense
about
this
he
said
incisively
i
heard
your
gun
i
saw
the
man
fall
no
one
else
but
you
could
possibly
have
fired
it
it
useless
to
lie
and
i
wo
stand
it
tell
me
at
once
what
happened
i
did
shoot
him
father
you
i
did
reiterated
jim
more
and
more
dumfounded
i
do
know
how
it
happened
honest
injun
i
do
father
edwards
mouth
shut
tight
he
swept
the
room
with
his
eyes
until
they
rested
upon
the
gun
in
the
rack
over
the
mantelpiece
he
stepped
forward
took
it
down
and
examined
it
holding
it
in
his
hands
he
gazed
about
the
floor
a
rag
which
the
ashes
in
the
fireplace
had
not
wholly
covered
caught
his
attention
you
cleaned
the
gun
and
put
it
away
he
said
grimly
then
you
tried
to
hide
the
rag
with
which
you
cleaned
it
and
he
touched
the
bit
of
cloth
sticking
from
the
ashes
contemptuously
with
his
foot
what
do
you
expect
me
to
think
from
that
jim
was
silent
the
boy
was
unlike
his
father
in
many
ways
but
they
were
alike
in
this
they
both
were
proud
each
would
meet
an
unjust
accusation
in
silence
and
jim
was
beginning
to
show
another
of
his
father
characteristics
a
still
anger
was
beginning
to
burn
in
him
against
this
man
who
accused
him
of
a
deed
which
he
himself
had
done
and
he
felt
rising
within
him
a
stubborn
will
to
endure
not
to
surrender
if
his
father
was
going
to
act
like
that
why
let
him
where
is
your
asked
edwards
jim
motioned
toward
the
drawer
is
your
there
too
yes
edwards
was
silent
after
all
he
was
a
just
man
he
was
trying
as
well
as
his
headache
would
let
him
to
see
things
straight
it
plain
what
happened
he
said
at
last
you
had
an
accident
and
got
frightened
you
cleaned
your
gun
you
hid
the
rags
you
put
away
your
ammunition
you
got
your
books
and
pretended
to
study
you
afraid
to
tell
the
truth
now
jim
face
flushed
hotly
but
he
kept
silent
such
assurance
such
cruelty
he
had
never
imagined
if
this
was
what
smugglers
were
like
if
this
was
a
sample
of
their
tricks
i
give
you
one
more
chance
to
tell
the
truth
said
edwards
did
you
do
it
no
i
did
said
jim
and
his
jaw
snapped
close
like
his
father
very
well
said
edwards
i
leave
you
until
you
change
your
mind
you
will
stay
here
sarah
will
bring
you
bread
and
milk
at
if
you
willing
to
talk
to
me
then
you
may
tell
her
that
you
like
to
see
me
he
turned
to
go
then
paused
it
a
serious
matter
and
all
the
facts
are
against
you
it
would
go
hard
with
you
in
court
it
will
go
harder
if
you
stick
to
your
stubborn
and
foolish
lie
one
thing
more
if
you
do
choose
to
tell
the
truth
you
will
have
to
reckon
with
the
law
as
well
as
with
me
edwards
upon
this
shut
the
door
and
departed
his
was
a
stern
figure
but
the
hurt
within
was
very
sore
this
then
he
reflected
bitterly
was
the
kind
of
boy
he
had
he
suffered
deeply
at
the
discovery
which
for
him
was
unquestionable
jim
felt
outraged
he
had
done
his
loyal
best
to
save
his
father
from
the
consequences
of
his
rash
act
and
now
with
incredible
ingenuity
and
cool
injustice
his
father
was
using
his
son
acts
of
helpfulness
to
make
it
appear
that
he
had
done
the
deed
without
a
scruple
his
father
had
made
him
a
scapegoat
jim
told
himself
that
he
would
gladly
have
taken
the
blame
had
his
father
as
chief
of
the
band
demanded
the
sacrifice
of
this
his
devoted
follower
nay
more
he
would
have
endured
the
ordeal
without
a
murmur
had
his
father
deeming
it
unsafe
to
enter
into
formal
explanations
only
hinted
to
him
that
this
was
a
farce
which
they
two
must
play
together
if
his
father
had
only
winked
at
him
surely
he
might
have
done
that
with
safety
but
not
to
be
admitted
to
the
secret
not
to
be
allowed
to
play
the
heroic
part
to
be
used
as
an
ignoble
tool
by
a
father
who
neither
loved
him
nor
knew
his
courage
that
was
too
much
he
would
not
betray
his
father
no
a
thousand
times
no
but
the
day
would
come
the
afternoon
dragged
on
jim
sat
there
in
his
room
looking
out
into
the
pleasant
sunshine
conscious
that
the
boys
were
playing
three
old
cat
in
the
field
not
faraway
as
rebellious
and
magnanimous
as
hot
and
angry
as
heroic
and
morally
muddled
a
boy
as
one
could
wish
to
see
and
looking
at
the
affair
from
his
point
of
view
not
many
people
will
blame
him
it
is
delightful
of
course
to
have
a
pirate
chief
for
father
but
what
if
he
makes
you
walk
the
plank
it
is
amusing
to
think
of
peaslee
and
jim
each
shut
up
in
his
respective
room
but
if
peaslee
in
his
gloomy
parlor
faced
by
the
crayon
portrait
of
his
masterful
wife
a
vase
of
wax
flowers
under
a
glass
dome
the
family
bible
on
a
table
and
three
stiff
chairs
had
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
leave
at
any
moment
he
was
even
more
perturbed
in
mind
terrible
mess
he
kept
repeating
to
himself
as
he
mopped
his
damp
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
terrible
and
indeed
it
would
be
awkward
for
a
respectable
citizen
with
political
aspirations
to
be
accused
before
a
grand
jury
of
which
he
is
a
member
of
assault
with
a
dangerous
weapon
upon
an
inoffensive
man
peaslee
reflections
rose
in
a
strophe
of
hope
and
fell
in
an
antistrophe
of
despair
ai
likely
it
hurt
him
any
just
bird
shot
said
hope
bird
shot
mighty
irritatin
specially
to
a
wrathy
fellow
said
despair
and
alternating
thus
his
thoughts
ran
on
bird
shot
show
i
did
have
any
serious
but
mebbe
a
piece
of
the
marble
struck
him
he
went
off
mighty
lively
do
seem
as
if
he
been
hurt
more
scared
hurt
likely
but
he
might
have
been
hurt
bad
arm
or
suthin
mebbe
marble
ai
anythin
but
baked
clay
split
all
to
pieces
but
ye
ca
tell
i
heard
ye
can
shoot
a
taller
candle
through
an
inch
plank
and
softer
than
a
marble
and
that
pesky
cat
jest
as
frisky
as
ever
had
any
one
seen
him
there
certainly
had
not
been
any
one
in
the
street
but
where
had
been
edwards
jim
the
housekeeper
where
had
his
own
wife
been
there
were
windows
from
which
she
might
have
seen
him
returning
some
from
which
she
might
even
have
seen
him
fire
the
fatal
shot
but
pshaw
there
now
probably
no
one
had
seen
him
at
all
not
even
his
wife
not
even
his
victim
probably
no
one
would
ever
find
out
must
have
been
some
worthless
feller
stealin
apples
mebbe
who
wo
dare
make
a
fuss
ai
likely
i
ever
hear
anythin
of
it
ai
no
use
sayin
anythin
till
suthin
happens
what
folks
do
know
do
hurt
none
the
structure
of
comfort
which
he
thus
built
himself
was
shaky
indeed
but
it
had
to
serve
he
nerved
himself
to
meet
his
wife
he
must
not
excite
her
suspicion
by
too
long
an
absence
she
was
doubtless
full
of
curiosity
for
of
course
she
had
heard
the
shot
and
would
expect
him
to
know
what
it
meant
it
would
not
do
to
seem
to
enter
the
house
by
the
front
door
sacred
to
formal
occasions
so
sneaking
outdoors
again
he
slipped
round
to
the
side
of
the
house
and
with
much
trepidation
went
into
the
kitchen
his
wife
began
the
moment
she
saw
him
well
of
all
the
crazy
carryings
on
she
cried
what
the
boy
firin
off
guns
for
right
under
peaceable
folks
windows
i
goin
to
speak
to
right
off
now
do
ye
sarepty
now
do
ye
said
peaslee
in
alarm
relieved
as
he
was
to
find
himself
unsuspected
he
did
not
like
the
idea
of
having
his
wife
pick
a
quarrel
with
edwards
for
what
he
himself
had
done
the
less
said
about
that
shot
the
better
he
would
be
pleased
for
the
land
sake
why
not
i
should
like
to
know
well
now
sarepty
i
would
that
boy
ai
more
of
a
boy
than
most
boys
i
guess
always
seemed
a
real
peaceable
little
feller
and
is
kinder
touchy
i
guess
it
might
make
hard
feelin
would
look
well
for
us
to
speak
bein
newcomers
so
i
would
sarepty
i
would
mebbe
some
time
i
slide
in
a
word
just
slide
it
in
kinder
easy
if
he
does
it
again
and
peaslee
looked
appealingly
at
his
wife
through
his
big
spectacles
his
eyes
looking
very
large
and
pathetic
through
the
strong
lenses
humph
said
his
wife
unmoved
i
ai
afraid
of
if
you
be
nor
could
she
be
moved
from
her
determination
peaslee
was
vastly
disturbed
but
presently
he
forgot
this
small
annoyance
in
greater
ones
that
evening
after
tea
when
he
went
up
to
the
he
heard
that
pete
lamoury
had
been
shot
by
jim
edwards
and
was
now
in
bed
with
his
wounds
jim
arrest
was
predicted
young
farnsworth
who
kept
the
crockery
store
told
him
the
news
and
presently
jake
hibbard
the
worst
shyster
in
the
village
shuffled
in
noticeable
anywhere
for
his
suit
of
rusty
black
his
empty
sleeve
pinned
to
his
coat
the
green
patch
over
his
eye
and
his
lips
he
confirmed
the
report
pete
hurt
bad
he
said
shaking
his
head
hurt
bad
i
taken
his
case
young
edwards
is
going
to
see
trouble
the
speech
frightened
poor
peaslee
and
he
was
hardly
reassured
by
the
skeptical
smile
of
squire
tucker
and
his
remark
that
he
would
believe
that
lamoury
was
hurt
when
he
saw
him
the
squire
had
small
faith
in
either
lamoury
or
hibbard
he
knew
them
both
but
peaslee
returned
home
with
dragging
feet
silent
and
preoccupied
all
the
evening
he
went
to
bed
early
but
not
to
sleep
long
he
lay
awake
and
tossed
while
the
calico
cat
wailed
on
the
rear
fence
exultant
triumphant
insulting
and
when
he
did
finally
get
to
sleep
he
dreamed
that
he
was
being
prosecuted
in
court
by
was
it
jake
hibbard
with
the
green
patch
over
his
eye
or
the
calico
cat
with
the
black
patch
over
hers
he
could
not
tell
study
the
fantastic
ominous
figure
of
his
prosecutor
as
he
would
illustration
cat
sitting
on
post
looking
forward
iii
immediately
after
breakfast
on
monday
morning
peaslee
in
a
mood
of
desperate
started
to
buy
a
knife
for
jim
all
day
long
on
sunday
when
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
think
he
had
struggled
between
his
fear
of
exposure
and
his
sorrow
for
the
boy
the
upshot
was
a
determination
to
make
it
up
to
him
by
giving
him
a
knife
he
had
in
his
mind
eye
a
marvel
handle
four
blades
saw
awl
file
corkscrew
such
a
knife
as
that
he
felt
would
console
any
boy
for
being
arrested
most
likely
will
end
right
there
he
said
to
himself
i
guess
i
better
go
to
farley
he
thought
as
he
walked
along
farley
owes
money
to
the
bank
he
wo
dare
to
stick
it
on
like
the
rest
but
when
he
entered
the
store
and
looked
about
his
face
fell
farley
was
not
there
willie
potter
farley
clerk
a
young
man
peculiarly
distasteful
to
solomon
lounged
forward
with
a
toothpick
in
his
mouth
peaslee
had
half
a
mind
to
go
but
the
thought
of
poor
jim
held
him
back
what
will
you
have
mr
peaslee
inquired
willie
affably
he
winked
at
young
dannie
snow
who
sat
grinning
on
a
keg
of
nails
as
much
as
to
say
watch
me
have
some
fun
with
the
old
man
i
thought
mebbe
i
look
at
some
said
solomon
eyeing
willie
distrustfully
yes
sir
i
guess
you
want
the
best
regardless
of
expense
said
willie
impudently
he
well
understood
his
customer
dislike
for
spending
a
penny
stepping
behind
the
counter
he
drew
from
the
and
held
up
admiringly
the
most
costly
knife
in
the
store
here
now
what
do
you
say
to
this
very
superior
article
best
horn
ten
blades
best
razor
steel
and
cheap
at
the
price
ca
be
beat
this
side
of
boston
just
the
article
for
you
sir
and
he
winked
again
at
dannie
snow
who
was
pink
with
suppressed
merriment
well
now
well
now
said
solomon
taking
the
knife
in
his
hand
and
pretending
to
examine
it
closely
that
a
pretty
knife
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
real
showy
ai
it
looks
as
if
was
made
to
sell
all
outside
and
no
money
in
the
bank
like
some
young
fellers
ye
see
dannie
snow
giggling
outright
peaslee
turned
and
gazed
at
him
in
mild
inquiry
young
potter
turned
a
dull
red
he
was
addicted
to
radiant
cravats
and
gauzy
silk
handkerchiefs
and
from
his
salary
of
eight
dollars
a
week
he
did
not
save
much
but
just
the
same
peaslee
had
been
staggered
at
the
price
pretending
still
to
examine
the
knife
which
willie
had
given
him
he
squinted
past
it
at
the
contents
of
the
glass
on
which
his
elbows
rested
there
all
sorts
of
knives
confronted
him
each
in
its
little
box
in
which
was
stuck
a
card
stating
the
price
the
cheapest
one
would
eat
up
the
proceeds
of
three
dozen
eggs
at
fifteen
cents
a
dozen
a
good
price
for
eggs
he
had
forgotten
that
knives
cost
so
much
a
good
knife
ai
any
use
to
a
boy
he
reflected
break
it
in
a
day
lose
it
in
a
week
would
be
any
real
kindness
to
him
just
wastin
money
he
pointed
finally
to
a
stubby
knife
with
one
big
blade
marked
there
now
said
he
that
what
i
call
a
knife
good
and
strong
and
no
folderol
guarantee
the
steel
do
ye
he
opened
the
blade
and
drew
it
speculatively
across
his
calloused
old
thumb
while
with
his
mild
blue
eyes
which
his
spectacles
enormously
exaggerated
he
fixed
the
humbled
willie
that
a
good
knife
for
the
money
said
that
young
man
sho
now
ye
do
say
so
said
peaslee
i
guess
ye
give
a
discount
do
ye
farley
always
allows
me
a
little
suthin
you
can
have
it
for
cents
said
willie
much
irritated
charge
it
guess
i
better
pay
cash
peaslee
answered
hastily
if
it
were
charged
his
wife
would
question
the
item
producing
an
enormous
wallet
very
worn
and
very
flat
from
his
cavernous
pocket
he
deliberately
searched
until
he
found
a
canadian
piece
and
adding
to
it
enough
to
make
up
the
price
handed
it
to
potter
and
left
the
store
peaslee
who
remembered
no
gift
from
his
father
other
than
a
very
occasional
big
copper
cent
thought
himself
pretty
generous
had
he
not
spent
pretty
nearly
the
price
of
two
dozen
eggs
but
now
a
question
occurred
to
him
which
he
had
not
thought
of
before
how
was
he
to
get
the
knife
to
jim
a
gift
from
him
would
excite
surprise
perhaps
suspicion
it
must
not
be
known
who
had
sent
it
ah
there
was
the
post
office
going
in
he
pushed
the
little
box
through
the
barred
window
say
cyrus
he
said
to
the
postmaster
kinder
weigh
up
this
consignment
for
me
will
ye
the
postmaster
weighed
the
box
that
will
cost
you
six
cents
he
said
thank
ye
returned
peaslee
and
dropping
the
box
into
his
deep
pocket
departed
half
a
dozen
eggs
more
to
get
it
to
his
neighbor
ai
right
he
muttered
ai
right
uncertain
what
to
do
with
his
gift
but
feeling
on
the
whole
pretty
virtuous
peaslee
now
started
home
he
thought
that
jim
would
not
be
going
to
school
but
would
wait
at
home
for
the
threatened
coming
of
the
constable
but
still
he
was
not
sure
and
he
wanted
to
keep
the
boy
under
his
eye
suddenly
he
straightened
there
was
judge
ames
walking
up
the
street
valise
in
hand
just
from
the
early
morning
train
he
had
come
a
few
days
before
the
opening
of
court
peaslee
knew
him
slightly
and
stood
much
in
awe
of
him
he
was
greatly
pleased
when
the
judge
stopped
and
shook
hands
with
him
i
am
glad
to
hear
peaslee
said
the
judge
in
his
precise
utterance
that
you
are
to
be
on
the
grand
jury
we
need
men
like
you
there
thank
ye
judge
thank
ye
said
peaslee
overcome
and
he
walked
on
home
quite
convinced
that
a
person
of
his
importance
in
the
community
should
not
be
sacrificed
to
the
comfort
of
any
small
boy
and
i
done
right
by
the
little
feller
i
done
right
he
assured
himself
feeling
the
knife
as
he
turned
into
his
own
yard
he
cast
an
anxious
eye
over
to
the
edwards
house
there
sat
jim
elbows
on
knees
chin
on
hands
staring
into
space
jim
was
thinking
that
his
father
had
he
been
a
pirate
chief
would
not
have
wiped
a
filial
tear
from
his
eye
whenever
he
thought
of
his
mother
and
the
boy
face
showed
it
the
spectacle
greatly
depressed
peaslee
the
smallest
faintest
question
entered
his
mind
whether
a
knife
would
console
such
melancholy
to
give
himself
a
countenance
while
he
watched
events
solomon
got
a
rake
and
began
gathering
together
the
few
autumn
leaves
which
had
fluttered
down
in
his
front
yard
it
was
not
useless
labor
for
they
would
come
in
handy
later
in
banking
up
the
house
and
so
presently
he
saw
sam
barton
the
constable
his
big
shoulders
rolling
as
he
walked
advancing
down
the
street
peaslee
expected
him
nevertheless
his
appearance
gave
him
a
disagreeable
shock
suppose
the
constable
had
been
coming
for
him
ai
arrestin
anybody
down
this
way
be
ye
he
called
with
a
feeble
attempt
at
jocularity
perhaps
after
all
looks
like
it
said
barton
succinctly
peaslee
stepped
to
the
fence
aint
likely
they
do
much
to
a
leetle
feller
like
that
i
guess
he
said
searching
the
constable
face
dunno
said
barton
passing
on
solomon
much
concerned
leaned
on
his
rake
and
watched
him
enter
the
edwards
house
jim
had
disappeared
there
was
some
delay
peaslee
came
to
the
door
arrestin
that
boy
be
they
solomon
she
said
well
serve
him
right
say
shootin
guns
off
so
like
father
like
son
dunno
as
the
son
i
as
soon
believe
it
of
the
father
everybody
knows
lamoury
and
he
been
mixed
up
together
some
of
his
smugglin
tricks
peaslee
had
taken
a
violent
dislike
to
her
taciturn
neighbor
and
she
did
not
care
who
knew
it
her
shrill
voice
seemed
to
her
husband
painfully
loud
and
indeed
it
was
beginning
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
group
of
children
who
had
gathered
about
the
edwards
gate
sh
hissed
solomon
might
hear
ye
would
hurt
us
if
he
should
take
his
account
out
of
the
bank
humph
exclaimed
peaslee
well
she
added
you
go
to
the
hearin
justice
is
suthin
i
guess
but
she
said
no
more
and
with
her
husband
and
the
children
awaited
events
a
silent
group
in
the
silent
street
before
the
silent
house
the
children
eyes
grew
bigger
and
bigger
with
excitement
was
not
jimmy
edwards
going
to
be
arrested
for
the
horrid
whisper
ran
one
small
boy
beginning
to
whimper
asked
if
jimmy
was
going
to
be
hung
the
occasion
was
solemn
even
to
the
older
eyes
of
peaslee
it
was
me
he
said
to
himself
presently
edwards
jim
and
the
constable
emerged
from
the
house
jim
looked
white
and
frightened
but
was
bravely
trying
to
bear
himself
like
a
man
edwards
his
long
shaven
upper
lip
stiff
as
a
board
looked
stern
and
uncompromising
barton
was
as
big
and
as
ever
he
turned
upon
the
little
boys
and
girls
and
waving
his
arm
cried
scat
they
fell
back
about
ten
feet
thus
the
procession
formed
barton
and
jim
then
edwards
and
at
a
barely
respectful
distance
the
crowd
of
youngsters
peaslee
much
moved
but
trying
hard
not
to
show
it
thrust
his
rake
under
the
veranda
with
a
great
show
of
care
and
joined
edwards
much
to
that
gentleman
surprise
solomon
heart
was
throbbing
with
a
great
resolution
i
always
aim
to
be
neighborly
said
he
nervously
lowering
his
voice
for
he
was
conscious
of
his
wife
still
standing
on
the
veranda
thought
i
just
step
along
too
i
mebbe
like
on
his
bail
bond
and
he
jerked
his
thumb
toward
jim
it
was
out
he
was
committed
and
solomon
heaved
a
great
sigh
he
knew
not
whether
of
relief
or
dismay
there
was
not
indeed
any
risk
in
signing
with
edwards
who
was
good
for
any
bail
that
the
justice
was
likely
to
require
but
what
would
peaslee
say
if
she
knew
he
glanced
apprehensively
toward
the
house
his
wife
had
gone
in
but
evil
omen
there
sitting
on
a
was
the
calico
cat
she
was
placidly
washing
her
face
and
as
her
paw
twinkled
past
the
big
black
spot
round
her
right
eye
she
appeared
at
that
distance
to
be
greeting
him
with
a
derisive
wink
edwards
although
his
mouth
shut
tighter
than
ever
at
the
mention
of
bail
was
surprised
and
touched
thank
you
he
said
it
kind
of
you
to
think
of
it
in
the
village
sam
ushered
them
into
the
musty
law
office
of
squire
tucker
justice
of
the
peace
the
squire
was
a
large
fat
man
clothed
in
rusty
black
with
a
carelessly
knotted
string
tie
pendent
beneath
a
rumpled
collar
he
had
a
fat
face
lighted
by
shrewd
and
kindly
eyes
which
gleamed
at
you
now
through
now
over
his
glasses
when
the
party
entered
he
was
writing
and
merely
looked
up
under
his
big
eyebrows
long
enough
to
wave
them
all
to
chairs
jim
sat
down
with
the
constable
behind
him
and
his
father
at
his
left
and
studied
the
man
in
whose
hands
he
thought
that
his
fate
rested
he
watched
the
squire
pen
go
from
paper
to
ink
ink
to
paper
and
listened
to
its
scratch
scratch
and
to
the
buzz
of
a
big
fly
against
the
dirty
ashamed
to
look
at
any
one
he
looked
at
the
lawyer
big
a
great
circular
affair
of
mottled
brown
wood
it
had
several
openings
each
one
with
its
own
little
cork
attached
with
a
short
string
to
the
side
of
the
stand
he
had
never
seen
one
like
it
before
then
some
one
entered
the
room
jim
looking
sidewise
recognized
jake
hibbard
and
began
covertly
to
study
his
face
he
knew
that
this
dirty
man
with
the
little
eyes
and
the
big
mouth
stained
brown
at
the
corners
with
tobacco
was
pete
lamoury
lawyer
familiar
for
many
years
to
his
contemptuous
young
eyes
jake
now
looked
sinister
and
dangerous
what
were
these
men
going
to
do
to
him
amid
his
fluttering
emotions
and
rushing
thoughts
one
thing
only
stood
fixed
and
clear
he
would
not
tell
on
his
father
some
day
when
all
trouble
was
past
he
would
let
his
father
know
that
he
knew
all
the
time
then
he
guessed
his
father
would
be
sorry
and
ashamed
now
since
his
father
would
not
take
him
into
his
confidence
he
would
not
pretend
he
did
the
shooting
that
would
be
his
only
revenge
finally
squire
tucker
pushing
his
writing
aside
ran
his
fingers
through
the
great
mass
of
his
tumbled
gray
hair
and
looked
quizzically
at
jim
over
his
glasses
so
this
he
said
is
the
hardened
ruffian
of
whom
our
esteemed
fellow
citizen
lamoury
complains
and
indeed
jim
although
stubborn
did
not
seem
very
dangerous
the
squire
looked
about
the
room
is
he
represented
by
counsel
he
asked
no
i
represent
him
said
edwards
the
charge
against
him
is
assault
with
intent
to
kill
i
believe
and
he
looked
with
demure
inquiry
at
jake
hibbard
who
nodded
with
a
face
tucker
was
not
taking
the
case
seriously
well
young
man
said
the
justice
to
jim
what
your
explanation
of
this
we
waive
examination
said
edwards
briefly
the
squire
leaned
back
in
his
chair
i
suppose
he
said
with
evident
reluctance
i
shall
have
to
hold
him
for
the
grand
jury
but
i
guess
the
safety
of
the
community
wo
be
greatly
threatened
if
i
let
him
out
on
bail
i
should
think
a
couple
of
hundred
would
do
i
suppose
there
be
no
difficulty
about
the
bond
the
tone
of
the
proceedings
suited
peaslee
well
in
his
nervousness
and
abstraction
he
had
backed
up
to
the
rusty
empty
iron
stove
at
the
end
of
the
room
and
stood
there
with
spread
listening
intently
on
hearing
the
amount
of
bail
he
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
his
incautious
offer
had
brought
him
no
dangerous
risk
edwards
however
did
not
answer
instead
consulting
the
justice
with
a
look
he
turned
and
beckoned
jim
to
follow
him
into
the
hall
james
he
said
this
is
the
last
chance
i
shall
give
you
if
you
confess
to
me
i
will
see
that
you
have
proper
bail
if
you
do
not
i
shall
let
the
law
take
its
course
you
may
choose
jim
was
exasperated
if
his
father
wished
to
be
mean
let
him
mean
at
least
he
might
drop
this
farce
this
irritating
pretense
he
lost
his
temper
i
do
care
what
you
do
he
said
fiercely
send
me
to
jail
if
you
want
to
i
guess
i
can
stand
it
is
that
all
you
have
to
say
jim
replied
with
a
rebellious
glance
very
well
said
his
father
then
we
will
go
back
once
in
the
room
he
stepped
to
the
squire
desk
and
talked
with
him
in
low
tones
then
the
justice
turned
to
jim
again
a
new
gravity
in
his
jolly
face
your
father
he
said
refuses
to
go
on
your
bond
have
you
any
sureties
of
your
own
to
offer
no
sir
said
jim
peaslee
was
outraged
what
kind
of
a
father
was
this
he
half
started
forward
to
offer
to
be
one
of
the
two
sureties
which
the
law
required
but
no
he
dare
not
the
second
surety
might
prove
to
be
any
sort
of
worthless
fellow
but
jim
in
jail
he
had
not
for
a
moment
dreamed
of
that
he
was
very
indignant
with
edwards
meanwhile
jake
hibbard
was
studying
edwards
face
with
puzzled
attention
he
had
supposed
that
the
lumber
dealer
whom
he
knew
to
be
would
have
paid
anything
signed
any
bond
to
protect
his
boy
from
jail
he
was
disconcerted
he
drew
his
one
hand
across
his
mouth
nervously
well
barton
said
squire
tucker
i
do
see
but
what
have
to
take
this
young
man
over
to
hotel
calkins
hotel
calkins
was
the
name
which
local
wit
gave
to
the
county
jail
the
words
sent
a
cold
shiver
down
peaslee
back
they
stung
him
into
generosity
as
barton
and
his
prisoner
followed
by
edwards
and
jake
brushed
by
him
on
their
way
to
the
door
he
slipped
the
knife
into
jim
hand
when
the
boy
trying
to
keep
back
the
tears
looked
up
inquiringly
he
murmured
in
agitation
do
ye
care
sonny
now
do
ye
care
he
was
greatly
stirred
or
he
would
not
have
been
so
incautious
as
to
make
his
present
in
person
and
in
public
illustration
cat
lying
on
fence
iv
when
nancy
ware
jim
pretty
teacher
heard
that
edwards
had
let
jim
go
to
jail
she
was
hotly
indignant
she
liked
jim
and
laughed
a
little
over
him
for
she
knew
he
adored
her
in
her
view
he
was
a
clumsy
nice
boy
awkward
and
shy
to
be
sure
but
rewarding
her
friendliness
now
and
then
with
a
really
entrancing
grin
she
liked
his
imagination
she
liked
his
loyalty
and
she
liked
his
dogged
resolution
she
heard
the
news
at
the
noon
hour
on
monday
and
after
her
dinner
she
hurried
at
once
to
the
store
of
fred
farnsworth
to
him
she
roundly
declared
that
edwards
was
a
brute
a
view
of
the
man
which
struck
fred
as
a
bit
highly
colored
fred
was
or
years
old
a
sensible
humorous
fellow
with
considerable
personal
force
he
was
very
proud
of
the
handsome
shop
over
which
hung
the
sign
frederick
farnsworth
fine
crockery
and
glassware
and
still
prouder
of
his
engagement
to
miss
ware
he
was
the
second
grand
juryman
from
ellmington
oh
said
he
edwards
is
a
bad
sort
of
man
he
is
very
sociable
i
guess
he
would
take
much
impudence
even
from
that
boy
of
his
they
say
jim
would
own
up
and
the
old
man
wo
do
anything
for
him
till
he
does
if
jimmie
edwards
says
he
did
fire
that
gun
he
did
said
nancy
positively
jimmie
is
the
lying
kind
i
know
edwards
i
ought
not
to
call
him
a
brute
i
suppose
but
he
one
of
these
obstinate
men
who
will
do
anything
they
made
up
their
minds
to
do
even
if
you
prove
to
them
that
they
wrong
even
if
it
hurts
them
more
than
it
does
any
one
else
he
just
got
it
into
his
head
that
jimmie
ought
to
confess
and
he
let
him
go
to
the
gallows
before
he
back
down
nancy
spoke
with
animation
her
color
rose
and
her
eyes
grew
bright
and
fred
looked
and
listened
admiringly
he
was
skeptical
about
jim
but
he
was
struck
with
the
accuracy
of
the
portrait
of
edwards
i
guess
that
about
so
he
said
and
when
i
think
of
that
poor
boy
shut
up
in
that
awful
jail
locked
into
a
cell
when
he
ought
to
be
playing
ball
and
having
a
good
time
it
makes
my
blood
boil
continued
miss
ware
now
fred
she
concluded
with
pretty
decision
you
must
stop
it
fred
laughed
is
that
a
pretty
large
order
he
asked
squire
tucker
put
him
there
i
guess
it
legal
you
can
do
said
his
betrothed
go
to
see
jimmie
see
if
you
ca
find
out
what
the
matter
jimmie
likes
you
perhaps
he
tell
i
did
know
jim
had
any
particular
partiality
for
me
said
fred
but
he
felt
kindlier
toward
the
boy
in
spite
of
himself
if
you
can
only
find
out
what
really
happened
i
know
we
can
get
him
out
averred
miss
ware
why
do
you
go
yourself
said
farnsworth
i
ca
not
till
five
of
course
i
going
then
that
about
four
hours
off
said
farnsworth
but
i
want
something
done
exclaimed
nancy
oh
said
fred
humorously
will
you
go
of
course
i
start
at
once
fred
dropped
his
banter
i
tell
you
what
nancy
i
may
not
be
able
to
do
much
right
off
but
promise
you
that
he
has
a
fair
chance
before
the
grand
jury
farnsworth
started
at
once
for
the
jail
it
was
a
poor
place
for
a
boy
he
reflected
as
he
rang
the
jailer
private
bell
calkins
himself
was
not
there
and
his
wife
came
to
the
door
she
knew
farnsworth
and
when
he
asked
if
he
might
see
jim
she
laughed
a
little
and
told
him
to
step
right
in
hotel
calkins
was
a
brick
building
which
looked
pleasantly
like
a
private
dwelling
as
in
fact
a
good
half
of
it
was
in
this
front
half
dwelt
the
jailer
in
the
rear
half
separated
from
the
living
quarters
by
a
thick
wall
and
heavy
doors
was
the
jail
proper
there
farnsworth
expected
to
be
led
but
not
at
all
calkins
ushered
him
into
her
own
kitchen
where
a
showed
what
she
was
doing
where
the
afternoon
sun
and
sweet
september
air
poured
in
at
the
open
windows
and
where
a
canary
in
its
cage
was
singing
cheerily
here
farnsworth
was
much
surprised
to
see
jim
curled
up
in
calkins
own
eating
a
large
apple
which
he
was
dividing
with
a
knife
squire
tucker
told
mark
said
calkins
enjoying
the
joke
that
he
guessed
james
would
like
our
society
full
as
well
as
that
of
the
prisoners
as
for
jim
he
grinned
affably
and
took
another
slice
of
his
apple
the
awful
picture
which
miss
ware
had
drawn
of
jim
dreadful
isolation
and
misery
and
her
own
indignant
sympathy
rushed
upon
farnsworth
mind
and
were
so
comically
out
of
relation
with
the
facts
that
he
sank
weakly
into
the
nearest
chair
and
roared
this
is
the
way
you
go
to
jail
is
it
he
gasped
calkins
smiled
in
sympathy
and
jim
that
he
ought
to
be
offended
at
this
frank
mirth
looked
sheepishly
at
the
floor
farnsworth
recovered
himself
a
mighty
good
friend
of
yours
he
said
sent
me
over
here
miss
ware
asked
jim
much
pleased
yes
she
coming
herself
right
after
school
loaded
down
with
things
to
console
your
desolate
prison
life
i
believe
and
farnsworth
had
to
stop
to
laugh
again
but
she
wanted
me
to
start
right
in
and
help
you
out
of
this
and
that
what
i
here
for
thank
you
said
jim
embarrassed
but
polite
but
it
struck
farnsworth
as
he
said
afterward
that
the
boy
shied
a
little
miss
ware
says
he
went
on
that
she
does
believe
you
fired
that
shot
and
she
wants
you
to
tell
me
exactly
what
did
happen
now
if
we
can
show
that
you
did
shoot
i
can
get
you
out
of
here
quick
what
they
going
to
do
to
me
said
jim
that
depends
it
makes
a
difference
how
much
lamoury
hurt
the
penalty
might
be
severe
if
he
got
a
bad
wound
but
even
then
if
we
could
show
that
you
did
know
he
was
there
or
that
the
gun
went
off
by
accident
or
that
you
were
firing
at
something
else
it
would
make
a
big
difference
and
if
you
can
show
that
you
there
at
all
why
out
you
go
but
jim
you
can
see
yourself
that
if
you
do
tell
what
you
know
everybody
think
that
you
shot
and
meant
to
hurt
lamoury
and
then
it
might
go
pretty
hard
with
you
now
come
tell
me
what
happened
you
better
tell
jimmie
said
calkins
straightening
up
from
her
you
wo
find
any
better
friends
than
farnsworth
and
miss
ware
the
young
man
as
he
talked
watched
the
boy
curiously
jim
flushed
and
squirmed
and
looked
now
at
the
floor
and
now
out
at
the
window
with
a
marked
uneasiness
and
embarrassment
that
greatly
puzzled
his
friend
and
when
he
stopped
and
the
boy
had
to
answer
his
distress
became
really
pitiable
ca
you
tell
me
jim
farnsworth
hazarded
after
a
little
putting
a
kindly
hand
on
the
boy
arm
while
calkins
stood
quiet
by
her
tub
in
friendly
expectation
but
jim
remained
dumb
after
waiting
a
little
farnsworth
seeing
the
boy
so
miserable
took
pity
on
him
well
never
mind
jim
he
said
you
need
tell
if
you
want
to
he
would
have
to
let
nancy
coax
it
out
of
him
but
he
was
puzzled
impressed
with
a
sense
of
mystery
and
with
a
growing
conviction
that
the
boy
was
shielding
some
one
else
he
began
to
talk
cheerfully
of
other
things
hoping
that
jim
might
perhaps
drop
a
useful
hint
or
at
least
that
the
boy
would
gain
confidence
in
him
as
a
friend
by
chance
he
asked
where
did
you
get
the
knife
jim
peaslee
gave
it
to
me
peaslee
exclaimed
farnsworth
he
well
knew
the
closeness
of
his
fellow
juror
it
is
much
of
a
knife
said
jim
apologetic
but
pleased
views
of
the
world
were
changing
his
father
although
a
bandit
chief
had
let
him
go
to
jail
while
this
stingy
old
man
with
no
halo
of
adventure
about
him
gave
him
a
knife
and
here
were
miss
ware
and
farnsworth
and
calkins
and
the
jailer
none
of
them
smugglers
who
were
very
kind
farnsworth
rose
to
go
then
jim
summoning
all
his
courage
asked
a
question
which
had
long
been
trembling
on
his
lips
what
do
they
do
to
smugglers
mr
farnsworth
fine
or
put
in
jail
or
both
why
nothing
much
said
jim
but
obviously
he
was
cast
down
farnsworth
walked
thoughtfully
toward
his
store
by
george
he
thought
suddenly
i
wonder
the
gossip
about
the
senior
edwards
had
occurred
to
him
and
at
the
same
time
he
remembered
the
quarrel
with
lamoury
but
what
nonsense
he
thought
if
edwards
wanted
to
shoot
any
one
he
would
do
it
in
his
own
back
yard
and
he
would
treat
his
own
boy
that
way
either
still
the
idea
clung
to
him
and
then
he
thought
of
nancy
and
chuckled
if
she
comes
to
the
store
before
she
goes
to
the
jail
i
wo
tell
her
what
she
find
there
he
promised
himself
meanwhile
peaslee
felt
a
growing
discomfort
he
ate
his
dinner
and
answered
the
brisk
questions
of
his
wife
with
increasing
preoccupation
like
miss
ware
he
was
picturing
jim
solitary
and
suffering
in
his
lonely
cell
with
the
utmost
sincerity
and
ingenuousness
he
condemned
edwards
hai
he
got
any
feelin
for
his
own
flesh
and
blood
he
asked
himself
ai
right
somebody
ought
to
deal
with
him
as
he
pottered
about
his
yard
after
dinner
he
finally
worked
himself
up
to
the
point
of
speaking
to
edwards
himself
even
his
righteous
indignation
would
not
have
led
him
to
this
undertaking
had
he
known
edwards
better
or
realized
the
father
present
mood
hurt
exceedingly
by
jim
lying
and
contempt
of
his
wishes
hurt
even
more
through
his
disappointed
desire
to
help
his
boy
edwards
was
sore
and
sensitive
discontented
both
with
jim
and
with
himself
he
did
not
want
jim
in
jail
he
told
himself
and
the
neighbors
who
were
so
uniformly
assuming
that
he
did
might
better
give
their
thoughts
to
matters
that
concerned
them
more
he
would
get
the
boy
out
of
jail
quick
enough
if
the
boy
would
only
let
him
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
house
to
do
an
errand
at
the
barn
peaslee
hailed
him
over
the
dividing
fence
somewhat
put
out
edwards
nevertheless
turned
and
walked
toward
his
neighbor
peaslee
leaning
over
the
fence
began
he
said
reaching
out
an
anxious
deprecatory
hand
do
ye
think
you
jest
a
leetle
mite
hard
on
that
boy
yourn
he
got
no
further
edwards
gave
him
a
look
that
made
him
shiver
and
cut
the
conversation
short
by
turning
on
his
heel
and
marching
toward
the
barn
dretful
man
dretful
peaslee
muttered
to
himself
nice
likely
boy
as
ever
was
if
i
had
a
boy
like
that
i
swan
i
would
treat
him
so
mean
he
turned
away
much
shocked
and
saw
the
calico
cat
watching
him
ironically
from
the
drat
that
cat
said
he
i
ai
goin
to
stay
round
here
not
with
that
beast
grinning
at
me
he
got
his
hat
and
started
not
knowing
in
the
least
what
he
intended
to
do
there
he
stopped
however
at
every
shop
window
and
studied
baseballs
bats
accordions
he
was
beginning
to
wonder
if
a
knife
was
enough
to
console
jim
for
his
unmerited
incarceration
he
was
gazing
forlornly
in
at
the
window
of
upham
drugstore
where
some
harmonicas
were
displayed
and
wondering
if
jim
would
be
allowed
to
play
one
in
his
dungeon
cell
when
hibbard
spoke
to
him
he
drew
the
lawyer
aside
and
peering
closely
into
his
face
with
anxious
eyes
exaggerated
by
his
spectacles
said
insinuatingly
jest
you
and
me
kinder
confidential
pete
ai
hurt
bad
is
he
you
do
mind
sayin
do
ye
jake
drew
himself
up
surprised
and
suspicious
did
the
old
fool
think
him
as
innocent
as
all
that
he
hurt
bad
peaslee
bad
he
said
with
dignity
of
course
it
is
fatal
unless
it
should
mortify
he
waved
his
hand
deprecatingly
i
ca
imagine
what
that
edwards
boy
used
in
his
gun
peaslee
knew
the
marble
he
trembled
still
he
knew
reputation
a
shrewd
thought
visited
his
troubled
mind
what
doctor
seein
him
he
asked
doctor
exclaimed
hibbard
irritated
doctor
you
know
these
french
canadians
they
worse
scared
of
a
doctor
than
of
the
evil
one
himself
pete
usin
some
old
woman
stuff
on
his
wounds
bear
grease
rattlesnake
oil
catnip
tea
what
do
i
know
i
ca
make
him
see
a
doctor
some
doctor
have
to
testify
to
court
wo
they
persisted
peaslee
oh
i
look
out
for
that
do
you
fear
the
lawyer
said
easily
but
nevertheless
he
made
a
pretext
for
leaving
the
old
man
perhaps
had
peaslee
fears
not
been
so
keen
he
would
have
taken
some
comfort
from
this
conversation
but
as
it
was
he
felt
that
the
lawyer
was
dangerous
he
feared
that
pete
really
was
badly
hurt
it
would
go
hard
then
with
jim
it
would
by
the
same
token
go
hard
with
himself
should
he
confess
suddenly
he
turned
and
rushed
into
upham
store
upham
said
he
i
want
and
he
pointed
straight
at
a
big
harmonica
with
a
strange
and
wonderful
harp
attachment
and
of
amazing
possibilities
upham
a
neat
little
gentleman
with
nicely
trimmed
who
was
always
fluttered
by
the
unexpected
hesitated
half
opened
his
mouth
and
then
forgot
either
to
shut
it
or
to
speak
why
peaslee
he
stammered
at
last
it
real
expensive
you
it
two
dollars
and
cents
do
care
nothin
what
it
costs
said
peaslee
who
was
in
a
hurry
for
fear
lest
he
should
think
twice
when
he
came
out
of
the
store
with
the
harmonica
in
his
hands
he
almost
stumbled
into
miss
ware
she
was
on
her
way
to
jim
and
of
course
her
mind
was
full
of
his
affairs
here
was
next
neighbor
she
impulsively
stopped
to
ask
if
the
misguided
father
still
held
to
his
resolution
about
jim
peaslee
had
reason
to
know
that
he
did
and
said
so
i
tell
ye
miss
ware
said
he
with
much
emotion
he
belongs
to
a
generation
and
that
a
fact
he
ai
got
any
compassion
in
him
seems
though
it
a
shame
a
perfect
shame
exclaimed
nancy
ai
right
said
peaslee
with
a
warmth
which
surprised
the
young
woman
and
made
her
warm
to
this
old
man
whom
she
had
always
thought
so
selfish
ai
right
your
own
flesh
and
blood
so
well
said
miss
ware
i
going
to
the
jail
now
i
want
to
see
jimmie
it
must
be
awful
there
well
now
that
real
kind
of
ye
responded
peaslee
i
wonder
now
if
you
mind
taking
this
along
to
him
and
he
offered
her
the
paper
parcel
it
a
harmonica
i
guess
they
call
it
real
handsome
it
cost
a
pretty
sum
i
feel
kinder
sorry
for
the
leetle
feller
and
i
do
grudge
it
a
mite
and
he
kept
repeating
in
a
tone
which
suggested
whistling
to
keep
your
courage
up
not
a
mite
not
a
mite
miss
ware
smothered
a
laugh
on
hearing
what
the
present
was
she
must
not
hurt
the
feelings
of
this
kind
old
man
oh
said
the
little
hypocrite
that
nice
jimmie
be
so
pleased
but
perhaps
the
harmonica
pleased
jim
as
much
as
the
schoolbooks
which
the
with
a
solicitous
eye
on
her
standing
in
his
studies
was
taking
to
him
saying
to
peaslee
miss
ware
books
and
harmonica
in
hand
went
on
her
way
to
visit
the
afflicted
boy
in
his
dungeon
meanwhile
jim
turning
the
wringer
for
calkins
and
listening
to
her
stories
of
mark
prowess
with
all
sorts
of
malefactors
was
having
an
excellent
time
he
had
decided
to
be
a
sheriff
when
he
grew
up
illustration
cat
curled
up
on
floor
v
the
day
of
the
assembling
of
the
grand
jury
for
the
september
term
of
the
adams
county
court
finally
dawned
how
peaslee
had
looked
forward
to
that
day
how
often
had
he
pictured
the
scene
the
bustle
about
the
court
house
the
agreeable
crowd
of
lawyers
with
their
clever
talk
their
good
stories
the
grave
judge
and
the
still
graver
side
judges
the
greetings
and
amid
much
joking
and
laughter
the
county
gossip
among
the
grand
jurors
in
the
informal
moments
before
they
filed
into
the
courtroom
to
be
sworn
and
to
receive
the
judge
charge
himself
finally
in
his
best
black
coat
and
cherished
beaver
hat
there
in
the
midst
of
it
important
weighty
respected
a
public
man
he
had
cherished
the
vision
of
himself
walking
up
the
village
street
on
that
first
morning
a
dignitary
returning
the
cordial
and
admiring
salutes
of
his
village
friends
he
had
seen
himself
later
in
the
shrewdly
leading
the
reluctant
witness
delivering
weighty
opinions
on
the
bearing
of
testimony
and
making
all
respect
him
as
a
marvel
of
conservatism
dignity
and
wisdom
this
was
to
be
one
of
the
most
important
and
pleasurable
days
of
his
life
the
rung
in
a
ladder
of
preferment
which
reached
as
high
as
the
dome
and
when
that
day
came
it
rained
steadily
gloomily
fiercely
rained
solomon
was
not
allowed
to
wear
his
best
clothes
when
peering
out
of
the
window
he
hopefully
said
he
guessed
mebbe
was
goin
to
clear
his
wife
invited
him
tartly
to
wait
till
it
did
she
insisted
that
he
put
on
his
clothes
and
thus
arrayed
and
without
meeting
a
single
villager
to
realize
the
importance
of
his
errand
he
waded
up
to
the
court
house
the
pelting
rain
rattling
on
his
old
umbrella
the
fierce
wind
almost
wrenching
it
inside
out
there
was
of
course
no
parade
on
the
courthouse
steps
for
the
benefit
of
a
wondering
village
as
there
would
have
been
had
the
day
been
fine
instead
the
men
steaming
with
wet
stood
about
uncomfortably
in
the
corridors
muddy
with
the
mud
from
their
feet
wet
with
the
drip
from
their
umbrellas
the
air
in
the
court
house
was
close
and
every
one
felt
uncomfortable
and
depressed
peaslee
having
greeted
three
or
four
men
whom
he
knew
found
himself
jammed
into
a
corner
behind
four
or
five
jurors
who
were
strangers
to
him
but
he
was
too
disheartened
to
try
to
scrape
acquaintance
with
them
he
felt
lonely
and
helpless
he
looked
enviously
over
to
the
other
end
of
the
corridor
where
fred
farnsworth
eben
sampson
and
albion
small
were
standing
together
in
contrast
with
the
others
these
men
were
laughing
albion
was
of
a
joker
peaslee
reflected
gloomily
then
old
abijah
keith
stormed
in
and
in
his
high
shrill
voice
began
immediately
to
utter
his
unfavorable
opinion
of
everything
and
everybody
well
if
he
ai
here
again
exclaimed
in
disgust
hiram
hopkins
one
of
the
men
in
front
of
solomon
cantankerest
old
lummux
in
the
whole
state
just
lots
on
upsetting
things
abijah
he
snorted
ca
abijah
i
call
him
peaslee
shrank
back
into
his
corner
nervously
he
knew
this
old
tyrant
and
dreaded
him
not
much
was
done
that
first
day
the
clerk
swore
them
the
judge
charged
them
and
appointed
the
sensible
steady
sampson
foreman
then
they
retired
to
the
a
big
desolate
place
wherein
was
a
long
table
surrounded
by
wooden
armchairs
and
spittoons
the
grand
jurors
seated
themselves
and
were
solemnly
silent
while
john
paige
the
state
attorney
began
the
dull
task
of
presenting
cases
peaslee
found
that
he
had
nothing
brilliant
to
say
as
a
matter
of
fact
his
own
troubles
were
making
him
see
everything
yellow
the
jurymen
did
not
seem
to
him
as
agreeable
a
lot
as
he
had
expected
and
as
for
paige
he
irritated
solomon
beyond
measure
paige
was
an
able
young
man
and
a
good
lawyer
and
was
entitled
to
the
position
which
he
had
attained
so
young
but
the
son
of
a
man
of
rather
exceptional
means
he
had
been
educated
at
a
city
college
and
had
a
sophistication
which
solomon
viewed
with
deep
suspicion
moreover
he
discarded
the
garb
which
peaslee
regarded
as
sacred
he
was
not
in
black
instead
he
wore
a
light
gray
business
suit
his
collar
was
very
knowing
in
cut
and
his
cravat
of
dark
blue
was
caught
with
a
gold
pin
citified
smart
aleck
was
peaslee
characterization
to
tell
the
truth
he
mistrusted
the
man
ability
and
was
afraid
of
him
if
that
fellow
knew
peaslee
felt
that
it
would
go
hard
with
him
generally
paige
was
popular
solomon
had
of
course
been
painfully
awake
to
every
hint
and
intimation
in
regard
to
jim
case
he
had
seen
jake
hibbard
that
carrion
crow
of
the
law
loafing
about
the
corridors
and
the
sight
had
made
him
shiver
he
had
next
heard
that
jim
case
would
be
quickly
called
probably
on
the
next
day
news
producing
a
complex
emotion
the
elements
of
which
he
could
not
distinguish
furthermore
a
remark
or
so
which
he
overheard
indicated
that
the
men
were
inclined
to
take
a
harsh
view
of
the
matter
and
reflecting
on
all
these
things
he
paddled
home
through
the
depressing
wet
and
the
next
day
it
rained
more
and
more
perturbed
as
the
climax
approached
peaslee
took
his
place
in
the
and
sat
there
with
unhearing
ears
he
sat
and
thought
and
delivered
battle
with
his
conscience
which
was
growing
painfully
vigorous
and
aggressive
but
after
all
perhaps
they
would
not
find
a
true
bill
and
then
jim
would
go
free
and
he
could
breathe
again
peaslee
clung
to
the
hope
and
hugged
it
it
was
the
one
thing
which
gave
him
courage
gentlemen
of
the
grand
jury
suddenly
he
heard
paige
saying
the
next
case
for
you
to
consider
is
that
of
james
edwards
aged
fifteen
of
ellmington
charged
with
assault
with
intent
to
kill
upon
one
peter
lamoury
also
of
ellmington
and
he
proceeded
to
read
the
complaint
which
in
spite
of
the
monotonous
rapidity
with
which
he
rattled
it
off
scared
peaslee
badly
with
its
legal
phraseology
gentlemen
said
paige
laying
down
the
paper
there
was
no
eyewitness
to
the
actual
assault
and
only
three
people
have
any
personal
knowledge
of
the
event
edwards
the
father
the
accused
himself
and
the
complainant
lamoury
his
counsel
tells
me
is
in
no
condition
to
appear
but
i
have
here
lifting
a
paper
his
affidavit
properly
executed
giving
his
version
of
the
matter
the
boy
father
however
is
at
hand
probably
the
jury
would
like
to
question
him
it
seems
to
me
said
sampson
that
edwards
would
be
pretty
apt
to
know
the
rights
of
it
if
he
willing
to
talk
i
guess
we
better
hear
him
the
state
attorney
stepped
to
the
door
this
way
please
he
called
and
edwards
entered
the
room
farnsworth
and
peaslee
both
studied
the
man
face
closely
although
for
very
different
reasons
and
both
found
it
sternly
uncompromising
please
take
a
chair
edwards
said
paige
and
in
a
swift
glance
rapidly
estimated
the
man
here
some
one
who
wo
lie
he
thought
impressed
now
he
resumed
will
you
kindly
tell
the
members
of
the
grand
jury
what
you
know
of
the
case
edwards
cleared
his
throat
painfully
determined
as
he
was
to
let
his
rebellious
boy
take
whatever
punishment
his
mistaken
course
might
bring
he
now
began
to
wish
that
the
punishment
would
be
light
his
confidence
that
jim
needed
only
to
be
pushed
a
little
to
confess
was
somewhat
shaken
and
the
charge
was
really
serious
he
felt
a
desire
to
explain
to
palliate
to
minimize
gentlemen
he
said
my
boy
always
been
a
good
boy
i
believe
that
he
meant
to
hurt
lamoury
or
any
one
else
it
must
have
been
some
accident
facts
please
said
paige
crisply
peaslee
caught
his
breath
indignantly
he
had
been
entirely
in
sympathy
with
edwards
soft
mode
of
approaching
his
story
paige
seemed
to
him
unfeeling
i
will
answer
any
questions
said
edwards
stiffening
did
you
hear
any
shot
fired
began
paige
yes
where
were
you
i
was
asleep
in
the
room
above
jim
was
jim
in
his
room
i
suppose
so
you
suppose
so
do
you
know
no
i
do
know
but
to
the
best
of
your
knowledge
and
belief
he
was
there
yes
and
the
shot
waked
you
yes
what
did
you
do
on
hearing
the
shot
i
jumped
to
the
window
tell
what
you
saw
please
i
saw
a
man
fall
in
the
orchard
and
hurried
out
to
see
if
he
was
hurt
but
he
was
gone
when
i
got
there
then
what
i
went
to
speak
to
jim
he
was
in
his
room
then
immediately
after
the
shot
yes
ah
and
when
you
spoke
to
him
did
he
admit
firing
the
shot
no
did
he
deny
it
yes
where
was
his
gun
in
the
rack
over
the
mantel
in
the
rack
over
the
mantel
repeated
paige
slowly
glancing
at
the
jurors
did
you
examine
it
yes
what
was
its
condition
did
it
show
that
it
had
been
fired
no
it
was
clean
it
was
clean
repeated
paige
i
understand
that
it
was
a
shotgun
were
there
any
rags
about
yes
where
were
they
one
was
in
the
ashes
of
the
fireplace
look
as
if
some
one
had
tried
to
hide
it
yes
reluctantly
if
it
was
that
sort
of
gun
there
must
have
been
a
and
where
were
they
in
the
drawer
where
jim
keeps
them
everything
looked
then
as
if
no
shot
had
been
fired
yes
was
there
any
one
besides
yourself
and
your
son
in
the
house
no
your
housekeeper
she
had
stepped
out
to
the
best
of
your
knowledge
then
there
was
no
one
about
to
fire
the
shot
except
your
son
no
that
will
do
said
paige
with
an
accent
of
finality
that
is
he
added
with
the
air
of
one
who
observes
a
courteous
form
unless
some
of
the
grand
jurors
wish
to
ask
a
question
there
were
various
things
which
were
new
to
peaslee
in
this
testimony
he
had
supposed
that
jim
had
been
picked
as
the
guilty
person
by
a
process
of
mere
exclusion
he
had
had
no
idea
that
the
case
against
him
was
so
strong
how
had
the
boy
got
to
the
room
so
soon
after
he
himself
had
left
and
why
had
he
gone
there
and
why
why
had
he
cleaned
the
shotgun
the
grand
jury
must
believe
in
his
guilt
and
when
the
case
came
to
trial
what
could
jim
say
to
clear
himself
it
was
going
hard
hard
with
the
boy
peaslee
mouth
grew
dry
his
palms
moist
he
moved
uneasily
in
his
chair
once
or
twice
he
felt
sure
that
the
next
instant
he
would
find
himself
on
his
feet
but
the
minutes
passed
and
he
still
was
seated
and
farnsworth
anxious
for
the
sake
of
his
betrothed
miss
ware
to
help
jim
was
nonplussed
there
were
two
possible
explanations
of
jim
cleaning
the
gun
if
he
did
clean
it
the
first
that
jim
was
protecting
himself
the
second
that
he
was
shielding
some
one
else
but
the
second
theory
seemed
quite
untenable
farnsworth
had
made
some
cautious
but
inquiries
about
edwards
and
had
satisfied
himself
that
the
rumors
about
his
smuggling
were
nothing
but
malicious
gossip
there
was
not
a
man
of
greater
honesty
in
the
state
the
boy
must
have
done
the
shooting
miss
ware
would
have
to
give
it
up
still
he
would
hazard
a
question
edwards
he
said
lamoury
worked
for
you
once
did
he
yes
you
quarreled
did
you
i
discharged
him
for
intemperance
there
was
no
bad
blood
lamoury
was
angry
i
believe
farnsworth
stopped
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
this
course
of
questioning
in
the
way
of
clearing
jim
of
course
later
the
point
that
lamoury
had
a
grudge
against
the
family
might
have
importance
although
he
could
not
see
just
how
some
one
else
surely
heard
that
gunshot
it
was
incredible
that
the
neighborhood
should
be
so
deserted
if
only
there
were
another
witness
the
other
jurors
had
no
questions
they
were
to
tell
the
truth
a
little
impatient
it
was
near
the
and
they
were
hungry
the
case
seemed
perfectly
plain
to
them
it
was
not
likely
they
argued
that
the
boy
father
could
be
mistaken
you
may
go
said
paige
to
edwards
i
do
see
he
began
when
the
witness
had
left
the
room
any
need
for
our
going
further
into
this
case
whatever
we
may
think
of
the
animus
of
the
complainant
i
take
it
that
was
what
you
wished
to
bring
out
farnsworth
there
seems
to
be
no
question
but
that
the
boy
fired
the
shot
the
presumption
seems
strong
also
that
he
intended
to
hit
were
there
any
accident
or
any
good
excuse
the
boy
could
of
course
have
no
motive
not
to
tell
it
i
suggest
that
a
true
bill
be
found
at
once
and
that
we
proceed
to
more
important
matters
i
want
to
remind
you
that
we
have
a
great
deal
of
work
before
us
well
gentlemen
said
sampson
i
guess
we
pretty
much
of
a
mind
about
this
if
no
one
has
any
objections
i
guess
we
call
it
a
vote
he
looked
round
as
we
all
agreed
he
began
just
a
moment
sampson
suddenly
exclaimed
farnsworth
it
had
just
then
flashed
over
him
that
peaslee
the
kind
peaslee
who
gave
jim
knives
and
harmonicas
was
neighbor
to
the
edwardses
if
he
had
been
at
home
when
the
shot
was
fired
he
must
have
heard
it
and
he
might
have
seen
some
significant
thing
which
questioning
might
bring
out
of
course
if
peaslee
had
seen
anything
he
would
have
spoken
but
he
might
have
overlooked
the
importance
of
some
fact
or
other
just
a
moment
sampson
he
said
and
put
up
his
hand
then
he
swung
sharply
in
his
chair
and
put
the
question
peaslee
where
were
you
when
that
shot
was
fired
illustration
cat
standing
alert
facing
forward
vi
peaslee
where
were
you
when
that
shot
was
fired
asked
farnsworth
and
as
he
spoke
he
turned
and
looked
toward
solomon
whose
seat
was
some
three
or
four
places
to
his
left
on
the
same
side
of
the
table
had
the
question
not
been
uttered
it
would
have
died
upon
his
lips
so
much
surprised
was
he
at
what
he
saw
peaslee
white
and
trembling
with
some
strong
emotion
had
his
hands
upon
the
table
and
was
raising
himself
slowly
and
painfully
to
his
feet
he
rolled
his
eyes
which
looked
bigger
and
more
pathetic
than
ever
behind
his
glasses
toward
farnsworth
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
but
the
young
man
knew
instinctively
that
solomon
moved
by
some
strong
idea
of
his
own
had
not
grasped
the
question
gentlemen
peaslee
began
in
shaky
tones
i
guess
i
got
a
word
to
say
afore
ye
find
a
true
bill
agin
that
little
feller
as
peaceable
a
boy
as
ever
i
saw
and
i
guess
i
ca
let
him
stay
all
bolted
and
barred
into
no
jail
when
it
do
need
anythin
but
my
to
get
him
out
ye
see
gentlemen
solomon
paused
moistened
his
dry
mouth
and
cast
a
timorous
look
over
the
puzzled
faces
of
the
jurymen
ye
see
was
me
that
shot
lamoury
not
a
sound
came
from
the
grand
jury
the
members
sat
and
stared
at
him
in
blank
wonder
hardly
able
to
credit
their
ears
paige
the
state
attorney
who
was
making
some
notes
at
the
time
held
his
pen
for
a
good
part
way
between
his
paper
and
the
inkstand
while
he
gazed
in
astonishment
at
peaslee
to
have
a
grand
juror
a
sober
respectable
man
rise
in
the
and
confess
that
he
is
the
real
offender
in
a
case
under
consideration
is
not
usual
the
surprise
was
absolute
for
farnsworth
it
was
more
than
a
surprise
it
was
a
relief
then
his
betrothed
had
been
right
jim
had
not
fired
the
shot
he
felt
a
glow
of
admiration
for
nancy
sure
intuition
and
loyalty
to
her
pupil
he
rejoiced
that
jim
was
cleared
for
her
sake
and
for
the
boy
insensibly
he
had
grown
more
and
more
interested
in
jim
and
attached
to
him
now
everything
was
explained
everything
no
jim
strange
activity
in
concealing
the
evidences
of
the
shot
his
queer
reserve
when
questioned
as
to
what
he
knew
these
seemed
more
perplexing
than
ever
farnsworth
hoping
for
light
upon
these
points
settled
back
in
his
chair
to
listen
peaslee
had
more
to
say
it
kinder
goes
agin
the
grain
solomon
resumed
with
a
weary
deprecatory
smile
to
own
up
you
been
actin
like
a
fool
but
i
guess
i
got
to
do
it
this
was
the
way
on
i
stepped
over
to
jest
to
talk
over
matters
and
things
well
i
could
seem
to
raise
anybody
to
the
front
of
the
house
so
i
kinder
slid
into
the
boy
room
to
see
if
there
was
somebody
out
back
there
there
did
seem
to
be
anybody
to
home
now
gentlemen
seems
as
though
you
see
how
was
when
i
tell
ye
there
an
old
white
and
yaller
cat
with
a
kinder
sassy
patch
over
her
eye
peaslee
meek
voice
here
took
on
a
trace
of
heat
that
been
the
life
out
o
me
goin
on
a
year
i
guess
ye
know
how
is
one
of
them
pesky
yowlin
rusty
old
nuisances
that
hai
any
sociability
to
anyhow
well
there
she
was
comfortable
as
a
hot
punkin
pie
and
lookin
as
if
she
owned
the
place
and
there
was
the
boy
gun
right
there
handy
the
cat
riled
me
so
i
jest
loaded
her
up
in
human
natur
not
to
now
was
it
nothin
but
bird
shot
so
i
sorter
stuck
in
a
marble
it
could
do
no
harm
and
it
might
kinder
help
a
leetle
and
i
just
fired
her
off
i
did
expect
to
hit
any
french
canadian
i
did
know
there
was
any
of
the
critters
round
then
when
i
see
a
feller
fall
out
of
the
bushes
i
was
scared
now
i
tell
ye
here
i
was
member
of
the
grand
jury
and
everything
and
it
did
somehow
seem
right
and
fittin
for
no
member
of
the
grand
jury
to
be
fillin
up
a
feller
human
bein
with
bird
shot
marbles
i
guess
i
did
think
much
what
i
was
of
any
rate
i
jest
sneaked
off
home
and
then
i
jest
let
things
slip
along
and
slide
along
till
here
i
be
i
guess
if
a
true
got
to
be
found
agin
any
one
it
got
to
be
found
agin
me
and
peaslee
sank
huddled
and
hopeless
into
his
chair
his
fellow
members
were
for
a
moment
silent
but
soon
this
tale
of
a
cat
bird
shot
and
an
unexpected
canadian
began
to
disclose
a
comic
aspect
the
plight
of
poor
respectable
peaslee
in
all
the
fresh
honors
of
his
jurorship
began
to
show
a
ludicrous
side
their
own
position
as
grave
men
seeing
what
they
thought
a
serious
offense
change
as
by
magic
into
a
farcical
accident
bit
by
bit
revealed
its
humor
sampson
the
foreman
glanced
at
paige
the
state
attorney
the
young
man
face
wore
an
odd
expression
their
eyes
met
and
sampson
mouth
began
to
twitch
albion
small
who
was
of
a
joker
suddenly
choked
farnsworth
having
revealed
to
him
in
a
flash
the
significance
of
the
harmonica
with
harp
attachment
gave
way
and
laughed
outright
smiles
appeared
on
faces
all
round
the
table
and
as
the
comicality
of
the
whole
affair
more
and
more
struck
upon
their
astonished
minds
the
smiles
became
a
general
laugh
the
laugh
a
roar
and
this
mirth
had
so
a
note
that
solomon
taking
heart
looked
about
the
table
with
a
sheepish
grin
but
his
heart
sank
and
his
grin
vanished
when
his
eyes
fell
upon
abijah
keith
for
abijah
did
not
smile
he
sat
grim
as
fate
stern
disapproval
of
all
this
levity
expressed
in
every
deep
fold
of
his
wrinkled
old
countenance
a
formidable
person
was
abijah
he
had
a
great
brush
of
white
hair
which
stood
up
fiercely
from
his
narrow
forehead
a
high
arched
nose
like
the
beak
of
a
hawk
on
which
rested
a
pair
of
huge
round
spectacles
a
mouth
like
a
straight
line
inclosed
between
a
great
parenthesis
of
leathery
wrinkles
up
from
under
his
stock
round
a
chin
like
a
curled
an
aggressive
white
wiry
beard
and
his
blue
eyes
were
and
hard
ca
see
what
you
cackling
so
for
he
exclaimed
his
shrill
accents
full
of
contempt
actin
like
a
passel
of
hens
there
a
man
shot
ai
they
somebody
shot
him
did
they
he
and
abijah
pointed
a
knotted
skinny
hard
old
finger
at
the
shrinking
solomon
he
shot
him
did
he
business
call
it
guess
the
grand
jury
got
suthin
to
say
to
it
hai
they
cat
cat
foot
say
likely
story
likely
story
do
believe
a
word
on
solomon
dared
to
steal
a
look
and
was
not
reassured
to
see
in
the
jurymen
faces
doubt
replacing
mirth
then
hiram
hopkins
hearty
voice
ringing
with
opposition
struck
upon
his
delighted
ear
he
remembered
hiram
dislike
for
the
cantankerous
keith
here
perhaps
was
a
defender
oh
come
keith
oh
come
now
he
heard
hopkins
exclaim
what
the
use
of
raising
a
rumpus
it
was
nothing
but
bird
shot
folks
do
go
murdering
folks
with
bird
shot
do
care
if
was
bird
shot
came
abijah
snapping
tones
do
care
if
was
principle
the
same
it
is
it
is
admitted
solomon
in
his
soul
well
said
hiram
with
a
common
sense
in
which
peaslee
took
comfort
the
practical
effect
is
mighty
different
gentlemen
he
added
to
the
jurors
i
ca
see
that
we
got
any
call
to
go
any
further
with
this
peaslee
was
just
shooting
at
a
cat
i
do
see
the
sense
of
taking
up
the
time
of
the
court
and
makin
expense
for
any
such
foolishness
i
say
we
better
dismiss
young
case
and
peaslee
along
with
it
it
such
fool
doings
i
think
we
better
if
only
to
keep
folks
from
laughing
at
the
grand
jury
solomon
heart
was
in
his
mouth
would
the
others
take
this
view
or
keith
oily
talk
dretful
oily
talk
came
abijah
fierce
pipe
take
any
stock
in
shot
him
did
he
grand
juror
what
difference
does
that
make
if
they
ai
fit
weed
out
weed
out
fit
said
hiram
it
took
some
spunk
to
get
up
there
and
tell
just
what
a
fool
he
been
did
humph
abijah
interrupted
with
a
snort
had
to
did
he
farnsworth
asked
him
where
he
was
did
he
had
to
squirm
out
somehow
did
he
got
about
as
much
spine
as
a
taller
candle
with
the
wick
drawed
out
accordin
to
his
own
showin
better
weed
him
out
better
weed
him
out
humph
poor
peaslee
sank
still
lower
in
his
chair
his
head
fell
still
lower
on
his
chest
they
were
taking
away
from
him
even
the
credit
of
voluntary
confession
why
had
farnsworth
asked
that
question
in
casting
doubt
upon
his
one
brave
deed
fate
seemed
to
him
to
have
done
its
worst
he
got
up
before
i
put
the
question
said
farnsworth
he
wished
to
be
just
but
he
was
indignant
with
peaslee
after
his
first
laughter
his
thoughts
had
dwelt
upon
the
trouble
that
solomon
had
brought
upon
the
innocent
jim
just
to
save
his
own
hide
the
old
he
exclaimed
to
himself
after
all
what
did
he
know
about
peaslee
if
the
man
had
merely
shot
at
a
cat
why
under
the
sun
should
he
not
have
said
so
at
once
and
saved
all
this
bother
the
more
he
thought
the
more
indignant
he
grew
and
the
more
doubtful
he
did
not
notice
at
all
the
look
of
timid
gratitude
which
peaslee
cast
in
his
direction
course
he
was
up
before
you
spoke
solomon
was
further
gratified
to
hear
hopkins
declare
in
his
big
hearty
voice
and
i
think
a
man
who
owns
up
fair
and
square
just
when
it
hardest
to
has
got
spine
enough
to
hold
him
together
anyhow
up
before
ye
asked
him
abijah
turned
on
farnsworth
up
for
what
tell
me
that
will
ye
and
solomon
listening
anxiously
for
farnsworth
answer
was
depressed
to
hear
him
give
merely
a
laugh
at
uncle
abijah
thrust
peaslee
asked
sampson
so
unexpectedly
that
solomon
jumped
did
you
say
something
about
a
marble
yes
said
peaslee
gloomily
fit
the
bore
did
it
continued
the
foreman
slick
answered
peaslee
with
the
brevity
of
despair
if
that
marble
fitted
the
bore
said
albion
small
while
sampson
nodded
assent
it
my
opinion
it
might
do
considerable
damage
his
opinion
had
weight
for
small
was
a
hunter
of
repute
recovered
from
their
amusement
the
grand
jurors
had
become
gradually
impressed
with
the
idea
that
peaslee
confession
still
left
some
awkward
questions
unanswered
if
the
matter
were
so
simple
as
he
said
why
had
he
kept
silent
so
long
the
jurymen
came
from
all
over
the
rather
large
county
and
although
they
all
had
some
knowledge
of
the
principal
men
of
ellmington
and
although
such
of
them
as
had
dealings
at
its
bank
had
met
peaslee
none
of
them
knew
him
well
he
was
a
newcomer
at
the
village
and
when
at
his
farm
had
not
had
a
wide
acquaintance
they
looked
to
farnsworth
as
his
fellow
townsman
to
speak
for
him
but
farnsworth
said
nothing
and
seemed
preoccupied
and
doubtful
the
inference
was
that
he
shared
their
perplexity
they
felt
that
keith
for
all
his
cantankerousness
might
be
right
solomon
could
draw
no
comfort
from
their
faces
all
this
while
paige
had
been
playing
with
his
and
watching
abijah
whose
character
he
appreciated
with
discreet
amusement
but
he
found
himself
in
essential
agreement
with
the
peppery
old
fellow
ask
the
state
attorney
why
do
ye
put
in
keith
impatiently
he
tell
ye
i
got
the
rights
on
ai
afraid
be
ye
sampson
smiled
state
attorney
he
said
turning
to
paige
i
guess
perhaps
you
better
give
us
the
law
of
this
well
gentlemen
said
paige
as
a
matter
of
law
keith
would
seem
to
be
right
and
at
the
word
solomon
spirits
sank
to
new
depths
did
i
tell
ye
said
abijah
triumphantly
had
the
state
attorney
said
that
he
was
wrong
the
old
man
would
have
called
him
a
popinjay
to
his
face
abijah
exclamation
was
not
deference
to
legal
knowledge
it
was
merely
quick
seizure
of
a
tactical
point
lamoury
was
shot
paige
went
on
with
a
little
smile
at
interruption
and
by
his
own
statement
peaslee
shot
him
on
his
own
admission
his
gun
was
dangerously
loaded
although
a
boy
a
neighbor
son
was
charged
through
his
act
with
a
serious
offense
against
the
laws
he
made
no
confession
and
when
at
last
he
did
speak
it
is
at
least
open
to
debate
whether
he
did
it
of
his
own
volition
or
because
he
was
forced
to
do
so
by
the
embarrassing
question
put
to
him
by
one
of
your
number
i
do
impugn
his
veracity
but
i
am
bound
to
remark
that
he
is
an
interested
witness
all
this
is
a
question
of
fact
for
you
to
consider
i
think
you
should
know
a
little
more
to
determine
if
there
was
any
motive
you
need
to
know
if
there
was
any
bad
blood
between
peaslee
and
lamoury
to
find
an
indictment
to
fit
the
case
you
need
to
know
how
badly
lamoury
is
hurt
i
think
you
should
have
lamoury
here
him
and
perhaps
peaslee
solomon
shivered
should
establish
whether
the
shot
was
accidental
as
the
accused
says
or
intentional
as
lamoury
contends
i
have
the
complainant
here
if
it
a
possible
thing
as
there
no
formal
charge
as
yet
against
peaslee
i
think
you
may
properly
postpone
until
then
the
question
of
entering
a
complaint
or
making
an
arrest
if
necessary
solomon
shivered
again
and
of
his
proper
holding
for
appearance
before
the
court
meanwhile
i
suggest
that
you
dispose
of
the
case
against
young
edwards
and
then
adjourn
peaslee
he
added
significantly
will
of
course
be
present
morning
sartain
sartain
answered
poor
solomon
tremulously
it
was
already
late
and
when
the
grand
jury
had
formally
dismissed
the
complaint
against
jim
the
hour
was
so
advanced
that
adjournment
was
taken
for
the
day
when
peaslee
left
the
court
house
no
one
spoke
to
him
and
he
walked
slowly
home
full
of
the
worst
forebodings
why
had
he
put
in
that
marble
relieved
of
his
burden
of
anxiety
and
remorse
in
regard
to
jim
he
began
to
think
more
definitely
than
he
had
done
heretofore
of
the
possibility
of
serious
harm
to
lamoury
it
was
dreadful
to
think
that
he
might
have
badly
wounded
an
inoffensive
man
was
lamoury
much
hurt
what
would
happen
to
a
marble
in
a
shotgun
anyhow
would
he
be
arrested
would
his
case
get
to
trial
could
he
without
a
single
witness
prove
that
it
was
an
accident
the
sinister
figure
of
jake
hibbard
rose
before
him
and
made
him
feel
helpless
and
frightened
the
future
looked
black
but
i
done
right
he
tried
to
console
himself
by
saying
i
done
right
better
late
than
never
to
be
sure
but
if
genuine
comfort
in
a
good
deed
is
sought
it
is
best
to
act
at
once
peaslee
could
feel
but
small
satisfaction
in
his
tardy
confession
moreover
he
must
now
face
his
wife
as
he
turned
with
reluctant
feet
into
his
own
yard
he
fairly
shrank
in
anticipation
under
the
sharp
hail
of
her
biting
words
to
postpone
a
little
the
inevitable
to
gather
strength
somewhat
to
meet
the
shock
he
passed
the
kitchen
porch
and
went
on
toward
the
barn
seating
himself
upon
an
upturned
pail
he
stayed
there
a
long
while
still
as
a
statue
while
he
chewed
the
cud
of
bitter
reflection
after
a
while
at
the
barn
door
there
was
a
familiar
flash
of
white
and
yellow
looking
wearily
up
he
saw
the
great
green
eyes
of
the
calico
cat
fastened
upon
him
in
fierce
distrust
she
had
one
foot
uplifted
as
if
she
did
not
know
whether
it
was
safe
to
put
it
down
and
in
her
mouth
pendent
was
a
calico
kitten
peaslee
silent
and
immovable
watched
her
with
apathetic
eyes
finally
as
if
assured
he
was
not
dangerous
she
put
down
her
foot
and
disappeared
with
soft
and
cushioned
tread
into
the
dim
recesses
of
the
barn
yet
a
little
while
and
she
again
appeared
in
the
doorway
with
a
second
duplicate
of
herself
again
an
interval
and
she
brought
a
third
well
said
solomon
to
himself
his
spirit
quite
crushed
i
guess
she
ai
bringing
no
more
than
belong
to
me
by
rights
nevertheless
he
could
not
endure
to
see
any
others
he
went
desperately
into
the
house
where
he
found
his
wife
fuming
over
his
delay
i
guess
i
may
as
well
tell
ye
first
as
last
he
said
in
a
sort
of
stubborn
despair
was
me
that
shot
lamoury
you
exclaimed
his
wife
dropping
her
knife
and
fork
and
looking
at
him
as
if
she
thought
he
had
taken
leave
of
his
senses
i
guess
i
the
feller
he
averred
with
queer
pathetic
humor
and
turning
a
patient
rounded
back
to
his
wife
expected
indignation
he
told
his
story
while
he
nervously
washed
at
the
sink
and
fumblingly
dried
his
face
and
hands
in
the
coarse
roller
towel
he
made
these
operations
last
as
long
as
his
confession
then
at
an
end
of
his
resources
he
turned
to
face
the
storm
peaslee
simply
looked
at
him
she
struggled
to
speak
but
she
found
herself
in
the
predicament
of
one
who
has
used
up
all
ammunition
on
the
and
comes
helpless
to
the
battle
she
simply
could
think
of
nothing
adequate
to
say
she
stared
at
her
husband
while
he
stared
out
of
the
window
then
she
gave
it
up
draw
up
your
chair
she
said
sharply
i
guess
ye
got
to
eat
whatever
ye
be
illustration
he
turned
to
face
the
storm
illustration
cat
drinking
from
saucer
vii
when
the
grand
jury
dispersed
after
peaslee
confession
farnsworth
first
speaking
a
few
words
to
paige
the
attorney
hurried
toward
the
union
school
as
he
expected
he
met
miss
ware
coming
from
it
on
her
way
to
her
he
waved
his
hat
and
called
jim
free
as
he
reached
her
side
he
added
he
did
fire
the
shot
at
all
of
course
he
did
cried
nancy
triumphantly
did
i
tell
you
but
who
did
and
how
did
you
find
out
peaslee
said
farnsworth
he
owned
up
peaslee
then
that
awful
harmonica
why
the
wretch
sh
warned
farnsworth
not
so
loud
these
are
secrets
which
i
not
supposed
to
tell
but
he
told
them
nevertheless
as
the
two
walked
along
together
he
gave
her
an
account
of
all
that
had
happened
but
what
i
do
understand
he
concluded
is
what
made
jim
behave
so
what
did
he
clean
his
gun
for
why
did
he
hide
the
rags
and
put
away
the
ammunition
he
acted
just
as
if
he
were
trying
to
shield
some
one
we
know
he
was
trying
to
shield
himself
and
i
do
see
why
he
should
shield
peaslee
fred
said
nancy
stopping
and
facing
him
jim
knew
that
his
father
was
the
only
person
in
the
house
did
he
yes
said
farnsworth
then
he
thought
his
father
did
it
o
pshaw
exclaimed
farnsworth
he
could
do
be
rude
fred
admonished
nancy
was
i
right
before
well
i
right
now
how
could
he
have
thought
anything
else
going
straight
to
the
jail
and
find
out
and
can
we
get
him
away
from
that
jail
yes
said
farnsworth
i
spoke
to
paige
he
said
he
bring
the
boy
in
and
have
him
discharged
this
afternoon
he
has
to
appear
before
the
judge
you
know
before
he
can
be
let
go
that
nice
said
nancy
now
fred
you
go
straight
to
edwards
and
bring
him
up
there
too
i
do
suppose
any
thought
to
tell
him
but
i
have
had
any
dinner
objected
farnsworth
dinner
exclaimed
miss
ware
in
deep
scorn
and
farnsworth
laughed
and
surrendered
they
separated
then
miss
ware
took
the
side
street
to
the
jail
while
farnsworth
hurried
along
toward
edwards
house
edwards
he
said
when
that
gentleman
appeared
at
the
door
miss
ware
wants
you
right
away
at
the
jail
and
as
he
spoke
he
was
struck
with
the
strain
which
showed
in
the
man
face
he
must
have
felt
it
a
good
deal
he
reflected
with
surprise
a
sudden
fear
showed
in
edwards
eyes
jim
is
sick
is
he
he
asked
oh
no
replied
farnsworth
hastily
he
cleared
that
all
we
have
him
out
of
jail
this
afternoon
cleared
repeated
edwards
distrustfully
was
farnsworth
joking
nothing
was
more
certain
in
the
father
mind
than
that
jim
had
fired
the
shot
no
other
supposition
was
possible
his
face
grew
severe
at
the
thought
that
farnsworth
was
trifling
with
him
yes
cleared
said
the
young
man
somewhat
nettled
we
have
absolute
certain
proof
that
jim
had
anything
to
do
with
it
i
should
like
to
hear
it
said
edwards
coldly
well
we
have
the
real
offender
own
confession
said
farnsworth
irritated
at
the
incredulity
of
the
man
what
was
the
fellow
made
of
edwards
said
nothing
he
turned
and
got
his
hat
and
walked
with
farnsworth
up
the
street
the
to
the
jail
his
face
was
impassive
but
his
movements
had
a
new
alertness
and
farnsworth
noted
that
he
had
to
walk
painfully
fast
to
keep
up
with
this
much
older
man
edwards
in
spite
of
his
cold
exterior
was
a
man
of
strong
feeling
and
there
was
in
fact
a
deep
joy
and
a
deep
regret
at
his
heart
he
knew
with
thankfulness
that
he
had
a
truthful
and
courageous
son
he
saw
with
passionate
that
he
had
done
the
boy
a
great
injustice
but
why
why
had
jim
cleaned
the
gun
farnsworth
little
guessing
the
turmoil
in
the
heart
of
the
grave
man
by
his
side
was
wondering
if
after
all
miss
ware
could
be
right
in
thinking
that
jim
had
sacrificed
himself
for
this
unfeeling
parent
if
she
is
right
he
reflected
thinking
how
harsh
had
been
the
father
treatment
of
the
boy
what
a
little
brick
jim
is
he
had
a
very
human
desire
to
present
this
view
and
prick
this
automaton
into
some
show
of
life
edwards
he
said
suddenly
jim
knew
did
he
that
you
were
the
only
person
besides
himself
at
home
i
suppose
so
does
it
occur
to
you
that
he
may
have
thought
you
did
the
shooting
that
ca
be
so
said
edwards
but
there
was
a
note
of
shocked
concern
of
dismay
in
his
tone
which
satisfied
farnsworth
and
again
he
thought
more
kindly
of
his
companion
and
edwards
was
stirred
by
the
unexpected
question
after
all
he
thought
since
jim
was
not
trying
to
shield
himself
whom
else
could
he
wish
to
shield
and
a
sudden
deep
enthusiasm
filled
him
for
this
son
who
was
not
only
courageous
and
truthful
but
who
in
spite
of
his
unjust
treatment
was
loyal
who
he
thrilled
at
the
word
loved
him
but
no
it
was
not
possible
how
could
his
son
have
thought
that
he
could
accuse
his
boy
of
what
he
had
done
himself
and
upon
this
doubt
he
found
himself
with
a
quickened
pulse
at
the
door
of
the
jail
farnsworth
rang
the
bell
soon
they
stood
in
calkins
facing
jim
and
nancy
and
then
miss
ware
caught
farnsworth
by
the
arm
and
drew
him
quickly
into
the
hall
and
shut
the
door
behind
her
i
certain
she
whispered
breathlessly
when
i
told
jim
first
he
was
glad
at
all
until
i
managed
to
let
him
know
his
father
was
arrested
o
fred
that
boy
a
little
trump
meanwhile
in
calkins
father
and
son
faced
each
other
and
it
would
be
hard
to
say
which
of
the
two
was
the
more
embarrassed
but
certain
questions
burned
on
edwards
lips
jim
he
said
with
anxious
emotion
did
you
think
that
shot
lamoury
yes
sir
said
jim
but
why
my
boy
why
should
i
want
to
shoot
him
lamoury
had
been
telling
said
jim
highly
embarrassed
telling
said
his
father
in
perplexity
yes
sir
said
jim
you
know
about
your
being
a
a
smuggler
much
astonished
edwards
pushed
his
questions
and
soon
came
to
know
the
depth
and
breadth
of
his
boy
misconception
then
he
said
finally
when
i
accused
you
of
having
fired
the
shot
you
thought
i
had
to
do
so
to
avoid
an
arrest
which
would
be
serious
for
me
is
that
it
yes
sir
edwards
could
not
speak
for
a
moment
for
emotion
then
he
drew
the
boy
to
him
my
son
my
son
he
said
you
and
i
must
know
each
other
better
and
by
the
same
token
jim
realized
that
his
father
was
proud
of
him
and
loved
him
it
was
new
and
sweet
he
felt
a
little
foolish
but
very
happy
jim
his
father
said
huskily
would
you
like
a
new
and
then
jim
was
happier
still
those
were
reluctant
feet
which
dragged
peaslee
the
next
morning
to
the
the
counsel
of
the
night
had
brought
no
comfort
and
when
he
came
among
his
fellows
their
constraint
and
silence
were
far
from
reassuring
nor
when
the
sitting
had
begun
did
he
like
the
enigmatic
smile
with
which
the
paige
stood
and
swung
his
how
he
distrusted
and
feared
this
smug
young
man
yet
the
state
attorney
first
words
brought
him
unexpected
comfort
lamoury
he
said
still
with
that
puzzling
smile
has
consented
in
spite
of
his
serious
physical
condition
to
appear
before
you
lamoury
could
not
be
so
badly
hurt
if
he
could
come
to
the
court
house
but
what
was
this
while
the
state
attorney
held
wide
the
door
jake
hibbard
solemnly
pushed
into
the
room
a
great
wheeled
chair
in
which
sat
the
small
wiry
lamoury
peaslee
heart
sank
as
he
saw
the
wheeled
chair
and
noted
the
great
bandages
about
the
frenchman
head
and
arm
he
listened
apprehensively
to
the
loud
complaint
of
cruelty
to
his
client
which
hibbard
continued
to
make
until
paige
pulling
the
chair
into
the
room
blandly
shut
the
door
in
his
face
peaslee
heaved
a
great
sigh
of
mingled
contrition
and
fear
this
wreck
was
his
work
he
would
be
punished
for
it
lamoury
paige
began
courteously
we
so
wished
to
get
your
version
of
this
painful

stopped
dramatically
his
little
sparkling
black
eyes
traveled
quickly
from
one
face
to
another
to
note
the
effect
he
had
made
peaslee
spirits
were
rising
the
grand
jury
could
not

such
a
passel
of
lies

of

peaslee
to
his
neighbor
who
nodded
that
he
had
the
courage
to
address
a
remark
to
any
one
shows
how
his
spirits
were
rising
you
said
you
were
going
along
the
short
cut
through

did
you
the
state
attorney
now
asked
yes

said
pete
paige
stepped
to
a
big
blackboard
which
he
had
had
set
up
at
the
end
of
the
room
and
rapidly
sketched
a
plan
of
the
edwards
lot
with
the
aid
of
a
memorandum
of
measurements
which
he
had
secured
a
line
across
the
upper
corner
represented
the
path
commonly
used
by
the
neighbors
in
going
through
the
orchard
now
lamoury
resumed
paige
i
do
quite
understand
how
if

on
the
path
there
you
could
have
seen

or
he

the

seems
to
be
in

way
until
just
at

and
when

while

heart
warmed
to
him
that
he
saw
you
fall
out
of
some
bushes
now
these
are
the
only
bushes
there
are
and
he
rapidly
indicated
on
the
board
the
rows
of
currant
bushes
the
asparagus
the
sunflowers
and
the
lilacs
which
lined
the
garden
on
its
corner
that
a

drew
a
square
on
peaslee
side
of
the
fence
directly
opposite
the
bushes
that
said
he
is
peaslee
and
he
brushed
the
chalk
from
his
fingers
with
an
air
of
indifference
cried
pete

an
air
of

pete
smiled
innocently

at

enigmatic
faces
of
the
jurymen
lamoury
said
paige
with
a
very
casual
air
behind
those
bushes
is
a
broken
board
said
pete

excellent
chance
to

pete
alarmed
and
excited
that
said
paige
calmly
is
the
only
place
where
you
could
be
and
get
shot
from
the
boy
window
either
you
were
there
or
you
were
shot
besides
edwards
found
your
pete
shrunk
his
head
into
his
shoulders
and
glared
questioningly
at
the
state
attorney
the
examination
was
not
going
to
his
liking
what
ah
care
for
dat
he
said
at
last
oh
nothing
said
paige
nothing
at
all
let

of

let
me
ask
why

nossing
ah

more
good
as
never
was
if

with
sympathy
you

not
have
a
very
high
opinion
of

ah

ah
tol
you
dat
was
mean
treek
for
play
on
poor
mans
and
pete
sought
sympathy
from
the
faces
about
him
that
was
too
bad
certainly
said
paige
now
about
those
wounds
of
yours
i
have
doctor
brigham
here
ready
to
make
an
examination
i
call
him
now
and
the
state
attorney
started
toward
the
door
of
the
pete
jumped
he
exclaimed
you
do
object
to
having
an
excellent
doctor
like
doctor
brigham
look
at
your
wounds
do
you
asked
paige
now
lamoury
had
no
wounds
to
show
the
smiling
paige
standing
there
and
looking
at
him
with
amused
comprehension
was
more
than
he
could
bear
pete
suddenly
lost
his
temper
never
too
secure
out
of
his
wheeled
chair
he
jumped
and
shaking
his
fist
in
paige
face
he
shouted
you
be
smart
very
smart
mans
well
ah
tol
you
you
ai
ah
tol
you
you
be
a
great
beeg
peeg
ah

my
fault
of

if
he
not
hit

you
be
peeg
you
be
all
peegs
every
one
and
pete
making
a
wide
inclusive
gesture
shouted
i
care
not
more
as
one
cent
for
de
whole
keet
and
caboodle
of
it
peeg
peeg
peeg
and
turning
on
his
heel
the
wrathful
frenchman
left
the
room
he
left
also
a
convulsed
jury
and
a
wheeled
chair
for
the
hire
of
which
hibbard
found
himself
later
obliged
to
pay
peaslee
the
thermometer
of
whose
spirits
had
been
rising
steadily
joined
in
the
laughter
which
followed
the
exit
of
the
discomfited
pete
terrible
smart
feller
paige
ai
he
said
he
to
albion
small
did
him
up
real
slick
did
he
the
delighted
solomon
had
quite
forgotten
his
dislike
for
the
citified
paige
of
course
the
grand
jury
promptly
abandoned
the
inquiry
the
fact
was
now
obvious
that
the
vengeful
lamoury
aided
by
the
unscrupulous
hibbard
had
merely
hoped
to
be
bought
off
by
edwards
and
had
been
disappointed
the
case
said
paige
would
never
have
come
to
trial
if
edwards
had
persisted
and
let
his
boy
go
to
court
they
have
had
to
stop
they
must
have
been
a
good
deal
disappointed
when
he
refused
bail
they
probably
thought
he
never
let
the
boy
pass
a
night
in
hotel
calkins
peaslee
walked
home
sobered
but
relieved
the
loss
of
public
esteem
which
had
come
to
him
through
his
foolish
adventure
the
serious
wrong
which
he
had
inflicted
upon
jim
edwards
the
disgust
of
his
wife
were
all
things
to
chasten
a
man
spirit
but
on
the
other
hand
jim
was
now
out
of
jail
lamoury
had
not
been
hurt
in
the
least
and
he
himself
had
not
been
complained
of
or
arrested
if
he
should
have
to
endure
some
chaffing
from
jim
bartlett
and
si
spooner
his
cronies
at
the
bank
he
guessed
he
could
stand
it
on
the
whole
he
was
moderately
happy
the
sun
was
low
in
the
west
and
the
trees
were
casting
long
shadows
across
his
yard
brightly
spattered
with
the
red
and
yellow
of
autumnal
leaves
his
house
white
and
neat
and
comfortable
seemed
basking
like
some
still
somnolent
animal
in
the
warm
sunshine
solomon
turned
and
cast
his
eye
down
the
road
and
over
the
random
river
flowing
smooth
and
peaceful
through
its
great
he
recognized
dannie
snow
scuffling
through
the
dust
with
his
bare
feet
as
he
drove
home
his
father
great
placid
cow
the
comfort
of
the
scene
the
cosy
pleasantness
of
the
place
among
the
hills
struck
him
in
his
relieved
mood
as
it
had
never
done
before
even
though
disappointed
in
political
ambition
a
man
might
live
there
in
some
content
after
all
he
had
thirty
thousand
dollars
and
it
had
been
calmly
drawing
interest
through
all
his
tribulations
consoled
by
this
reflection
he
walked
to
the
rear
of
his
house
and
began
pottering
about
the
chicken
yard
then
in
the
edwards
garden
appeared
jim
solomon
gave
a
slight
start
and
took
a
hesitating
step
or
two
as
if
minded
to
flee
but
restrained
by
shame
he
watched
the
boy
come
to
the
fence
and
climb
upon
it
he
said
nothing
he
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
that
harmonica
was
fine
said
jim
grinning
amiably
peaslee
was
immensely
relieved
if
there
was
a
momentary
twinge
at
the
thought
of
the
money
it
had
cost
him
it
was
quickly
gone
glad
ye
enjoyed
it
seem
though
i
wanted
to
give
ye
a
little
suthin
considerin
i
hope
you
and
your
father
ai
ones
to
lay
it
up
agin
me
that
all
right
said
jim
grandly
i
had
a
bully
time
at
the
jail
calkins
is
a
splendid
woman
you
just
ought
to
eat
one
of
her
doughnuts
did
know
they
fed
ye
up
much
to
the
jail
commented
solomon
puzzled
oh
i
was
locked
up
said
jim
and
explained
well
well
i
beat
that
was
clever
on
it
now
said
peaslee
much
pleased
and
father
ai
holding
any
grudge
either
said
jim
he
says
he
much
obliged
to
you
a
remark
which
the
reader
will
understand
better
than
peaslee
ever
did
you
listen
when
you
eating
your
supper
cried
jim
as
he
climbed
down
from
the
fence
and
ran
toward
the
house
i
going
to
play
on
that
harmonica
and
solomon
rejoiced
poor
man
he
did
not
know
how
the
popularity
of
his
gift
was
destined
to
endure
he
did
not
know
that
he
had
let
loose
upon
the
circumambient
air
sounds
worse
than
any
ever
emitted
by
the
calico
cat
filled
with
the
pleasant
sense
of
having
made
it
up
with
the
boy
whom
he
thought
he
had
so
greatly
injured
solomon
started
along
the
path
toward
the
kitchen
door
he
began
to
realize
that
he
had
an
appetite
something
now
long
unfamiliar
to
him
as
he
drew
near
an
appetizing
odor
smote
his
nostrils
eyesters
i
swanny
he
ejaculated
it
was
unheard
of
there
was
nothing
which
solomon
who
had
a
keen
relish
for
good
things
to
eat
and
would
even
have
been
extravagant
in
this
one
particular
had
his
wife
permitted
enjoyed
more
than
an
oyster
stew
or
which
he
had
a
chance
to
taste
less
often
oysters
could
be
had
in
town
for
sixty
cents
a
quart
a
sum
that
seems
not
large
but
in
peaslee
mind
they
were
associated
with
the
elegance
and
luxury
of
church
sociables
and
with
the
dissipation
of
supper
after
country
dances
they
were
extravagant
food
solomon
could
not
believe
his
nose
he
entered
the
door
and
there
upon
the
table
stood
the
big
tureen
with
two
soup
plates
at
peaslee
place
there
was
nothing
else
but
the
stew
of
course
but
it
lent
a
gala
air
to
the
whole
kitchen
why
sarepty
sarepty
he
said
to
his
wife
you
goin
to
be
arrested
asked
peaslee
sharply
she
wanted
no
sentiment
over
her
unwonted
generosity
but
truth
to
tell
when
she
had
seen
solomon
depart
that
morning
and
realized
that
he
might
be
going
to
arrest
possibly
to
trial
perhaps
to
conviction
and
to
jail
she
had
felt
a
sudden
fright
a
sudden
sympathy
for
her
husband
and
she
had
bought
half
a
pint
of
oysters
for
a
stew
in
spite
of
expense
no
i
ai
going
to
be
arrested
said
solomon
with
satisfaction
the
grand
jury
found
there
anythin
to
it
but
but
sarepty
he
paused
helplessly
unable
to
express
his
complex
feelings
about
the
stew
and
the
attitude
on
the
part
of
his
wife
which
it
revealed
oh
well
said
his
wife
after
all
ai
if
you
gone
and
lost
money
and
after
supper
peaslee
carefully
poured
some
skimmed
milk
into
a
saucer

went
out
to
the
