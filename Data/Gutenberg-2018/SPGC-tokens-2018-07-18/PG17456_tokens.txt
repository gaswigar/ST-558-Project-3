the
romance
of
a
christmas
card
i
it
was
christmas
eve
and
a
saturday
night
when
larrabee
the
beulah
minister
wife
opened
the
door
of
the
study
where
her
husband
was
deep
in
the
revision
of
his
next
day
sermon
and
thrust
in
her
comely
head
framed
in
a
knitted
rigolette
luther
i
going
to
run
down
to
letty
we
think
the
twins
are
going
to
have
measles
it
the
only
thing
they
have
had
and
letty
spirits
are
not
up
to
concert
pitch
you
look
like
a
blessed
old
prophet
my
dear
what
the
text
the
minister
pushed
back
his
spectacles
and
ruffled
his
gray
hair
isaiah
vi
i
heard
the
voice
of
the
lord
saying
whom
shall
i
send
then
said
i
here
am
i
send
me
it
does
sound
a
bit
like
christmas
somehow
it
has
the
spirit
if
it
has
the
sound
said
the
minister
there
is
always
so
little
spare
money
in
the
village
that
we
get
less
and
less
accustomed
to
sharing
what
we
have
with
others
i
want
to
remind
the
people
that
there
are
different
ways
of
giving
and
that
the
bestowing
of
one
self
in
service
and
good
deeds
can
be
the
best
of
all
gifts
letty
boynton
wo
need
the
sermon
do
be
late
reba
of
course
not
when
was
i
ever
late
it
has
just
struck
seven
and
i
be
back
by
eight
to
choose
the
hymns
and
oh
luther
i
have
some
fresh
ideas
for
christmas
cards
and
i
am
going
to
try
my
luck
with
them
in
the
marts
of
trade
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
such
things
sold
nowadays
and
if
the
banner
likes
my
verses
well
enough
to
send
me
the
paper
regularly
why
should
the
people
who
make
cards
like
them
too
especially
when
i
can
draw
and
paint
my
own
pictures
i
no
doubt
they
like
them
who
would
if
the
parish
knew
what
a
ready
pen
you
have
they
suspect
that
you
help
me
in
my
sermons
the
question
is
will
the
publishers
send
you
a
check
or
only
a
copy
of
your
card
i
should
relish
a
check
i
confess
but
oh
i
should
like
almost
as
well
a
beautifully
colored
card
luther
with
a
picture
of
my
own
inventing
on
it
my
own
verse
and
in
tiny
letters
somewhere
in
the
corner
it
would
make
such
a
lovely
christmas
present
and
i
should
be
so
proud
inside
of
course
not
outside
i
would
cover
my
halo
with
my
hat
so
that
nobody
in
the
congregation
would
ever
notice
it
the
minister
laughed
consult
letty
my
dear
david
used
to
be
in
some
sort
of
picture
business
in
boston
she
will
know
perhaps
where
to
offer
your
card
at
the
introduction
of
a
new
theme
into
the
conversation
larrabee
slipped
into
a
chair
by
the
door
her
lantern
swinging
in
her
hand
david
ca
be
as
near
as
boston
or
we
should
hear
of
him
sometimes
a
pretty
sort
of
brother
to
be
meandering
over
the
earth
and
letty
working
her
fingers
to
the
bone
to
support
his
children
twins
at
that
it
was
just
like
david
gilman
to
have
twins
does
it
seem
incredible
that
he
can
let
christmas
go
by
without
a
message
i
dare
say
he
does
even
remember
that
his
babies
were
born
on
christmas
eve
to
be
sure
he
is
only
letty
but
after
all
they
grew
up
together
and
are
nearly
the
same
age
you
always
judged
david
a
little
severely
reba
do
despair
of
reforming
any
man
till
you
see
the
grass
growing
over
his
bare
bones
i
always
have
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
for
him
when
i
remember
his
friendship
for
my
dick
but
that
was
before
your
oh
these
boys
these
boys
the
minister
voice
quavered
we
give
them
our
very
we
love
them
cherish
them
pray
over
them
do
our
best
to
guide
them
yet
they
take
the
path
that
leads
from
home
in
some
way
god
knows
how
we
fail
to
call
out
the
return
love
or
even
the
filial
duty
and
respect
well
we
wo
talk
about
it
reba
my
business
is
to
breathe
the
breath
of
life
into
my
text
am
i
lord
send
me
letty
certainly
continues
to
say
it
heroically
whatever
her
troubles
yes
letty
is
so
ready
for
service
that
she
will
always
be
sent
till
the
end
of
time
but
if
david
ever
has
an
interview
with
his
creator
i
can
hear
him
say
am
i
lord
send
letty
the
minister
laughed
again
he
laughed
freely
and
easily
nowadays
his
first
wife
had
been
a
sort
of
understudy
for
a
saint
and
after
a
brief
but
depressing
connubial
experience
she
had
died
leaving
him
with
a
boy
of
six
a
boy
who
already
at
that
tender
age
seemed
to
cherish
a
passionate
aversion
to
virtue
in
any
form
the
result
perhaps
of
daily
doses
of
the
catechism
administered
by
an
abnormally
pious
mother
the
minister
had
struggled
valiantly
with
his
paternal
and
parochial
cares
for
twelve
lonely
years
when
he
met
wooed
and
won
very
much
to
his
astonishment
and
exaltation
reba
crosby
there
never
was
a
better
bargain
driven
she
was
by
the
family
bible
but
in
face
heart
and
mind
while
he
would
have
been
printed
as
sixty
in
who
who
in
new
hampshire
although
he
was
far
older
in
patience
and
experience
and
wisdom
the
minister
was
spiritual
frail
and
a
trifle
prone
to
the
minister
new
wife
was
spirited
vigorous
courageous
and
clever
she
was
also
good
as
gold
and
invincibly
incurably
gay
the
minister
grew
younger
every
year
for
reba
doubled
his
joys
and
halved
his
burdens
tossing
them
from
one
of
her
fine
shoulders
to
the
other
as
if
they
were
feathers
she
swept
into
the
quiet
village
life
of
beulah
like
a
salt
sea
breeze
she
infused
a
new
spirit
into
the
bleak
church
sociables
and
made
them
positively
agreeable
functions
the
choir
ceased
from
wrangling
the
sunday
school
plucked
up
courage
and
flourished
like
a
green
bay
tree
she
managed
the
deacons
she
braced
up
the
missionary
societies
she
captivated
the
parish
she
cheered
the
depressed
and
depressing
old
ladies
and
cracked
jokes
with
the
invalids
ai
she
a
little
mite
too
jolly
for
a
minister
wife
questioned
ossian
popham
who
was
a
professional
pessimist
if
this
world
is
a
place
of
want
woe
wantonness
an
wickedness
same
as
you
claim
maria
i
do
see
how
a
minister
wife
be
too
jolly
was
her
husband
cheerful
reply
look
how
she
melted
up
the
ice
in
both
congregations
the
other
church
is
most
willin
we
should
prosper
so
long
as
mis
larrabee
stays
here
an
we
do
get
too
fur
ahead
of
in
attendance
me
for
the
smiles
maria
and
osh
popham
was
right
for
reba
larrabee
convinced
the
members
of
the
rival
church
the
rivalry
between
the
two
being
in
rigidity
of
creed
not
in
persistency
in
good
works
that
there
was
room
in
heaven
for
at
least
two
denominations
and
said
that
if
they
could
unite
in
this
world
perhaps
they
get
round
to
it
in
the
next
finally
she
saved
letitia
boynton
soul
alive
by
giving
her
a
warm
understanding
friendship
and
she
even
contracted
to
win
back
the
minister
absent
son
some
time
or
other
and
convince
him
of
the
error
of
his
ways
let
dick
alone
a
little
longer
luther
she
would
say
do
hurry
him
for
he
wo
come
home
so
long
as
he
a
failure
it
would
please
the
village
too
much
and
dick
hates
the
village
he
does
accept
our
point
of
view
that
we
must
love
our
enemies
and
bless
them
that
despitefully
use
us
the
village
did
despitefully
use
dick
and
for
that
matter
david
gilman
too
they
were
criticized
gossiped
about
judged
without
mercy
nobody
believed
in
them
nobody
ever
praised
them
and
what
is
that
about
praise
being
the
fructifying
sun
in
which
our
virtues
ripen
or
something
like
that
i
not
quoting
it
right
but
i
wish
i
said
it
they
were
called
wild
when
most
of
their
wildness
was
exuberant
vitality
their
mistakes
were
magnified
their
mad
pranks
exaggerated
if
i
been
married
to
you
my
dear
while
dick
was
growing
up
i
would
have
let
you
keep
him
here
in
this
little
backwater
of
life
he
needed
more
room
more
movement
they
would
have
been
so
down
on
him
in
racine
wisconsin
larrabee
lighted
her
lantern
closed
the
door
behind
her
and
walked
briskly
down
the
lonely
road
that
led
from
the
parsonage
at
beulah
corner
to
letitia
boynton
house
it
was
bright
moonlight
and
the
ground
was
covered
with
snow
but
the
lantern
habit
was
a
fixed
one
among
beulah
ladies
who
even
when
they
were
not
widows
or
spinsters
made
their
evening
calls
mostly
without
escort
the
light
of
a
lantern
not
only
enabled
one
to
pick
the
better
side
of
a
bad
road
but
would
illuminate
the
face
of
any
male
stranger
who
might
be
of
a
burglarious
or
murderous
disposition
reba
larrabee
was
not
a
timid
person
indeed
she
was
wont
to
say
that
men
were
so
scarce
in
beulah
that
unless
they
were
ruffians
it
would
be
an
inspiration
to
meet
a
few
even
if
it
were
only
to
pass
them
in
the
middle
of
the
road
there
was
a
light
in
the
as
she
passed
and
then
there
was
a
long
stretch
of
shining
white
silence
unmarked
by
any
human
habitation
till
she
came
to
the
black
cottage
inhabited
by
davis
as
the
little
old
man
was
called
in
the
village
in
the
distance
she
could
see
osh
popham
house
brilliantly
illuminated
by
kerosene
lamps
and
as
she
drew
nearer
she
even
descried
ossian
himself
seated
at
the
cabinet
organ
in
his
practicing
the
christmas
anthem
his
daughter
holding
a
candle
to
the
page
while
she
struggled
to
adjust
a
circuitous
alto
to
her
father
tenor
on
the
hither
side
of
the
popham
house
and
quite
obscured
by
it
stood
letitia
boynton
gray
cottage
it
had
a
clump
of
tall
cedar
trees
for
background
and
the
bare
branches
of
the
elms
in
front
were
hung
lightly
with
snow
garlands
as
larrabee
came
closer
she
set
down
her
lantern
and
looked
fixedly
at
the
familiar
house
as
if
something
new
arrested
her
gaze
it
looks
like
a
little
she
thought
and
how
queer
of
letty
to
be
sitting
at
the
open
window
nearer
still
she
crept
yet
not
so
near
as
to
startle
her
friend
a
tall
brass
candlestick
with
a
lighted
tallow
candle
in
it
stood
on
the
table
in
the
parlor
window
but
the
room
in
which
letty
sat
was
unlighted
save
by
the
fire
on
the
hearth
which
gleamed
brightly
behind
the
quaint
andirons
hessian
soldiers
of
iron
painted
in
gay
colors
over
the
mantel
hung
the
portrait
of
letty
mother
a
benign
figure
clad
in
black
silk
the
handsome
head
topped
by
a
snowy
muslin
cap
with
floating
strings
just
round
the
corner
of
the
fireplace
was
a
door
leading
into
a
tiny
bedroom
and
the
flickering
flame
lighted
the
heads
of
two
sleeping
children
arms
interlocked
bright
tangled
curls
flowing
over
one
pillow
letty
herself
sat
in
a
low
chair
by
the
open
window
wrapped
in
an
old
cape
of
ruddy
brown
homespun
from
the
folds
of
which
her
delicate
head
rose
like
a
flower
in
a
bouquet
of
autumn
leaves
one
elbow
rested
on
the
table
her
chin
in
the
cup
of
her
hand
her
head
was
turned
away
a
little
so
that
one
could
see
only
the
knot
of
bronze
hair
the
curve
of
a
cheek
and
the
sweep
of
an
eyelash
what
a
picture
thought
reba
the
very
thing
for
my
christmas
card
it
would
do
almost
without
a
change
if
only
she
is
willing
to
let
me
use
her
wake
up
letty
she
called
come
and
let
me
in
why
your
front
door
is
closed
the
fire
smoked
a
little
when
i
first
lighted
it
said
letty
rising
when
her
friend
entered
and
then
softly
shutting
the
bedroom
door
that
the
children
might
not
waken
the
night
is
so
mild
and
the
room
so
warm
i
could
help
opening
the
window
to
look
at
the
moon
on
the
snow
sit
down
reba
how
good
of
you
to
come
when
you
been
rehearsing
for
the
christmas
tree
exercises
all
the
afternoon
illustration
ii
it
never
of
me
to
come
to
talk
with
you
letty
and
the
minister
wife
sank
into
a
comfortable
seat
and
took
off
her
rigolette
enough
virtue
has
gone
out
of
me
to
christianize
an
entire
heathen
nation
oh
how
i
wish
luther
would
go
and
preach
to
a
tribe
of
cannibals
somewhere
and
make
me
superintendent
of
the
how
i
should
like
to
deal
just
for
a
change
with
some
simple
problem
like
the
undesirability
and
indigestibility
involved
in
devouring
your
neighbor
now
i
pass
my
life
in
saying
your
neighbor
as
yourself
which
is
far
more
difficult
than
to
say
your
neighbor
it
such
a
disgusting
habit
and
wrong
besides
though
i
dare
say
they
do
it
half
the
time
because
the
market
is
bad
the
first
thing
i
do
would
be
to
get
my
cannibals
to
raise
sheep
if
they
ate
more
mutton
they
eat
so
many
missionaries
letty
laughed
you
so
funny
reba
dear
and
i
was
so
sad
before
you
came
in
do
let
the
minister
take
you
to
the
cannibals
until
after
i
die
no
danger
letty
do
you
remember
i
told
you
i
been
trying
my
hand
on
some
verses
for
a
christmas
card
yes
have
you
sent
them
anywhere
not
yet
i
could
think
of
the
right
decoration
and
color
scheme
and
was
afraid
to
trust
it
all
to
the
publishers
now
i
found
just
what
i
need
for
one
of
them
and
you
gave
it
to
me
letty
i
yes
you
as
i
came
down
the
road
the
house
looked
so
quaint
backed
by
the
dark
cedars
and
the
moon
and
the
snow
made
everything
dazzling
i
could
see
the
firelight
through
the
open
window
the
hessian
soldier
andirons
your
mother
portrait
the
children
asleep
in
the
next
room
and
you
wrapped
in
your
cape
waiting
or
watching
for
something
or
somebody
i
was
watching
or
waiting
i
was
dreaming
said
letty
hurriedly
you
looked
as
if
you
were
watching
anyway
and
i
thought
if
i
were
painting
the
picture
i
would
call
it
or
vigil
or
duty
however
when
i
make
you
into
a
card
letty
nobody
will
know
what
the
figure
at
the
window
means
till
they
read
my
verses
i
give
you
the
house
the
room
the
andirons
and
even
portrait
but
you
do
mean
that
you
want
to
put
on
the
card
and
letty
turned
like
a
startled
deer
as
she
rose
and
brushed
a
spark
from
the
no
not
the
whole
of
you
of
course
though
i
not
clever
enough
to
get
a
likeness
even
if
i
wished
i
merely
want
to
make
a
color
sketch
of
your
cape
your
hair
that
matches
it
your
ear
an
inch
of
cheek
and
the
eyelashes
of
one
eye
if
you
please
that
does
sound
quite
so
terrifying
and
letty
looked
more
manageable
nobody
ever
know
that
a
real
person
sat
at
a
real
window
and
that
i
saw
her
there
but
when
i
send
the
card
with
a
finished
picture
and
my
verses
beautifully
lettered
on
it
the
printing
people
will
be
more
likely
to
accept
it
and
if
they
do
shall
i
have
a
dozen
to
give
to
my
asked
letty
in
a
wheedling
voice
you
shall
have
more
than
that
i
willing
to
divide
my
magnificent
profits
with
you
you
will
have
furnished
the
picture
and
i
the
verses
it
wonderful
letty
it
providential
you
just
a
christmas
card
it
seems
so
strange
that
you
even
put
the
lighted
candle
in
the
window
when
you
never
heard
my
verse
the
candle
caught
my
eye
first
and
i
remembered
the
christmas
customs
we
studied
for
the
church
festival
the
light
to
guide
the
christ
child
as
he
walks
through
the
dark
streets
on
the
eve
of
mary
yes
i
thought
of
that
said
letty
flushing
a
little
i
put
the
candle
there
first
so
that
the
house
should
be
all
dark
when
the
pophams
went
by
to
and
just
then
i
i
remembered
and
was
glad
i
did
it
these
are
my
verses
letty
and
reba
voice
was
soft
as
she
turned
her
face
away
and
looked
at
the
flames
mounting
upward
in
the
chimney
my
door
is
on
the
latch
the
hearth
fire
is
aglow
i
seem
to
hear
swift
passing
feet
the
christ
child
in
the
snow
my
heart
is
open
wide
for
stranger
kith
or
kin
i
would
not
bar
a
single
door
where
love
might
enter
in
there
was
a
moment
silence
and
letty
broke
it
it
means
the
sort
of
love
the
christ
child
brings
with
peace
and
in
it
i
glad
to
be
a
part
of
that
card
reba
so
long
as
nobody
knows
me
and
here
she
made
an
impetuous
movement
and
covering
her
eyes
with
her
hands
burst
into
a
despairing
flood
of
confidence
the
words
crowding
each
other
and
tumbling
out
of
her
mouth
as
if
they
feared
to
be
stopped
after
i
put
the
candle
on
the
table
i
could
not
rest
for
thinking
i
was
ready
in
my
soul
to
light
the
christ
child
on
his
way
i
was
bitter
and
unresigned
it
is
three
years
since
the
children
were
born
and
each
year
i
have
hoped
and
waited
and
waited
and
hoped
thinking
that
david
might
remember
david
my
brother
their
father
then
the
fire
on
the
hearth
the
moon
and
the
snow
quieted
me
and
i
felt
that
i
wanted
to
open
the
door
just
a
little
no
one
will
notice
that
it
ajar
i
thought
but
there
a
touch
of
welcome
in
it
anyway
and
after
a
few
minutes
i
said
to
myself
no
use
david
wo
come
but
i
glad
the
firelight
shines
on
mother
picture
for
he
loved
mother
and
if
she
had
died
when
he
was
scarcely
more
than
a
boy
things
might
have
been
different
the
reason
i
opened
the
bedroom
door
something
i
never
do
when
the
babies
are
asleep
was
because
i
needed
a
sight
of
their
faces
to
reconcile
me
to
my
duty
and
take
the
resentment
out
of
my
heart
and
it
did
flow
out
reba
out
into
the
stillness
it
is
so
dazzling
white
outside
i
could
bear
my
heart
to
be
shrouded
in
gloom
poor
letty
and
larrabee
furtively
wiped
away
a
tear
how
long
since
you
have
heard
i
did
dare
ask
not
a
word
not
a
line
for
nearly
three
months
and
for
the
before
that
it
was
nothing
but
a
note
sometimes
with
a
bill
enclosed
david
seems
to
think
it
the
natural
thing
for
me
to
look
after
his
children
as
if
there
could
be
no
question
of
any
life
of
my
own
you
began
wrong
letty
you
were
born
a
prop
and
you
been
propping
somebody
ever
since
i
done
nothing
but
my
plain
duty
when
my
mother
died
there
was
my
stepfather
to
nurse
but
i
was
young
and
strong
i
did
mind
and
he
was
a
burden
long
poor
father
then
after
four
years
came
the
shock
of
david
reckless
marriage
when
he
asked
if
he
might
bring
that
girl
here
until
her
time
of
trial
was
over
it
seemed
to
me
i
could
never
endure
it
but
there
were
only
two
of
us
left
david
and
i
i
thought
of
mother
and
said
yes
i
remember
letty
i
had
come
to
beulah
then
yes
and
you
know
what
eva
was
how
david
how
anybody
could
have
loved
her
i
can
not
think
well
he
brought
her
and
you
know
how
it
turned
out
david
never
saw
her
alive
again
nor
ever
saw
his
babies
after
they
were
three
days
old
still
what
can
you
expect
of
a
father
who
is
barely
if
he
old
enough
to
have
children
he
old
enough
to
notice
them
said
larrabee
with
her
accustomed
spirit
somebody
ought
to
jog
his
sense
of
responsibility
it
wrong
for
women
to
assume
burdens
beyond
a
certain
point
it
only
makes
them
more
selfish
if
you
only
knew
where
david
is
you
ought
to
bundle
the
children
up
and
express
them
to
his
address
not
a
word
of
explanation
or
apology
simply
tie
a
tag
on
them
saying
your
twins
but
i
love
the
babies
said
letty
smiling
through
her
tears
and
david
may
not
be
in
a
position
to
keep
them
then
he
should
have
had
them
retorted
reba
promptly
especially
not
two
of
them
there
such
a
thing
as
a
man
being
too
lavish
with
babies
when
he
has
no
intention
of
doing
anything
for
them
but
bring
them
into
the
world
if
you
had
a
living
income
it
would
be
one
thing
but
it
makes
me
burn
to
have
you
stitching
on
coats
to
feed
and
clothe
your
children
perhaps
it
does
make
any
difference
now
sighed
letty
pushing
back
her
hair
with
an
abstracted
gesture
i
gave
up
a
good
deal
for
the
darlings
once
but
that
past
and
gone
now
after
all
the
only
life
i
have
and
i
rather
make
coats
for
them
than
for
myself
letty
boynton
had
never
said
so
much
as
this
to
larrabee
in
the
three
years
of
their
friendship
and
on
her
way
back
to
the
parsonage
the
minister
wife
puzzled
a
little
over
the
look
in
letty
face
when
she
said
david
seemed
to
think
there
could
be
no
question
of
any
life
of
my
own
and
again
i
gave
up
a
good
deal
for
the
darlings
once
luther
she
said
to
the
minister
when
the
hymns
had
been
chosen
the
sermon
pronounced
excellent
and
they
were
toasting
their
toes
over
the
fire
luther
do
you
suppose
there
ever
was
anything
between
letty
boynton
and
your
dick
no
he
answered
reflectively
i
do
think
so
dick
always
admired
letty
and
went
to
the
house
a
great
deal
but
i
imagine
that
was
chiefly
for
david
sake
for
they
were
as
like
as
peas
in
a
pod
in
the
matter
of
mischief
if
there
had
been
more
than
friendship
between
dick
and
letty
dick
would
never
have
gone
away
from
beulah
or
if
he
had
gone
he
surely
would
have
come
back
to
see
how
letty
fared
a
fellow
yearns
for
news
of
the
girl
he
loves
even
when
he
is
content
to
let
silence
reign
between
him
and
his
old
what
makes
you
think
there
was
anything
particular
reba
what
makes
anybody
think
anything
i
wonder
why
some
people
are
born
props
and
others
leaners
or
twiners
i
believe
the
very
leaned
heavily
against
letty
when
she
lay
on
her
infant
pillow
i
did
know
her
when
she
was
a
child
but
i
believe
that
when
she
was
eight
all
the
other
children
of
three
and
five
in
the
village
looked
to
her
for
support
and
guidance
it
a
great
vocation
that
of
being
a
prop
smiled
the
minister
as
he
peeled
a
red
baldwin
apple
carefully
preserving
the
spiral
and
eating
it
first
i
suppose
the
wobbly
vine
thinks
it
grand
to
be
a
stout
trellis
when
it
needs
one
to
climb
on
but
does
the
trellis
ever
want
to
twine
i
wonder
and
reba
tone
was
doubtful
even
the
trellis
leans
against
the
house
reba
well
letty
never
gets
a
chance
either
to
lean
or
to
twine
her
family
her
friends
her
acquaintances
even
the
stranger
within
her
gates
will
pass
trees
barber
poles
telephone
and
telegraph
poles
convenient
corners
of
buildings
fence
posts
ladders
and
lightning
rods
for
the
sake
of
winding
their
weakness
around
her
strength
when
she
sits
down
from
sheer
exhaustion
they
come
and
prop
themselves
against
her
back
if
she
goes
to
bed
they
climb
up
on
the
footboard
hang
a
drooping
head
and
look
her
wistfully
in
the
eye
for
sympathy
prop
on
prop
ever
seems
to
be
the
underlying
law
of
the
universe
poor
reba
she
is
talking
of
letty
and
thinking
of
herself
and
the
minister
eye
twinkled
well
a
little
admitted
his
wife
but
i
only
a
village
prop
not
a
family
one
where
you
are
concerned
and
she
administered
an
affectionate
pat
to
his
cheek
as
she
rose
from
her
chair
i
a
trellis
that
leans
against
a
rock
illustration
iii
letitia
boynton
life
had
been
rather
a
drab
one
as
seen
through
other
people
eyes
but
it
had
never
seemed
so
to
her
till
within
the
last
few
years
her
own
father
had
been
the
village
doctor
but
of
him
she
had
no
memory
her
mother
second
marriage
to
a
venerable
country
lawyer
john
gilman
had
brought
a
kindly
inefficient
stepfather
into
the
family
a
man
who
speedily
became
an
invalid
needing
constant
nursing
the
birth
of
david
when
letty
was
three
years
old
brought
a
new
interest
into
the
household
and
the
two
children
grew
to
be
fast
friends
but
when
gilman
died
and
letty
found
herself
at
eighteen
the
mistress
of
the
house
the
nurse
of
her
aged
stepfather
and
the
only
guardian
of
a
boy
of
fifteen
life
became
difficult
more
difficult
still
it
became
when
the
old
lawyer
died
for
he
at
least
had
been
a
sort
of
fictitious
head
of
the
family
and
his
mere
existence
kept
david
within
bounds
david
was
a
lively
handsome
youth
good
at
his
lessons
popular
with
his
companions
always
in
a
scrape
into
which
he
was
generally
drawn
by
the
minister
son
so
the
neighbors
thought
at
any
rate
dick
larrabee
as
david
senior
received
the
lion
share
of
the
blame
when
mischief
was
abroad
if
parson
larrabee
boy
could
behave
any
better
than
an
unbelieving
a
methodist
farmer
or
a
baptist
storekeeper
what
was
the
use
of
claiming
superior
efficacy
for
the
congregational
form
of
belief
dick
father
never
succeeded
in
bringing
him
into
the
church
though
he
worked
on
him
from
the
time
he
was
to
a
toad
said
popham
his
mother
kind
o
vaccinated
him
with
religion
leavin
him
to
take
it
the
natural
way
as
the
ol
sayin
is
was
her

response
the
first
mis
larrabee
was
as
good
as
gold
but
she
may
have
overdone
the
trick
a
little
mite
mebbe
and
what
more
i
kind
o
suspicion
the
parson
thinks
so
himself
he
ai
never
been
quite
the

the
opinion
of

of
the
comatose
kind
whose
minds
had
never
been

the
dazzling
idea

there
was
considerable
truth
in
ossian
popham
remark
as
letty
could
have
testified
for
the
conduct
of
the
household
as
well
as
that
of
the
minister
had
been
continually
under
inspection
and
discussion
nothing
could
remain
long
hidden
in
beulah
nobody
spied
nobody
pried
nobody
listened
at
doors
or
windows
nobody
owned
a
microscope
nobody
took
any
particular
notice
of
events
or
if
they
did
they
preserved
an
attitude
of
profound
indifference
while
doing
it
yet
everything
was
known
sooner
or
later
the
amount
of
the
fish
and
meat
bill
the
precise
extent
of
credit
the
number
of
letters
in
the
post
the
amount
of
fuel
burned
the
number
of
absences
from
church
and
the
calls
or
visits
made
and
received
the
hours
of
arrival
or
departure
the
source
of
all
incomes
these
details
were
the
common
property
of
the
village
it
even
took
cognizance
of
more
subtle
things
for
it
observed
and
recorded
the
fluctuations
of
all
love
affairs
and
the
fluctuations
also
in
the
religious
experiences
of
various
persons
not
always
in
spiritual
equilibrium
for
the
soul
was
an
object
of
scrutiny
in
beulah
as
well
as
mind
body
and
estate
letty
boynton
used
to
feel
that
nothing
was
exclusively
her
own
that
she
belonged
to
beulah
part
and
parcel
but
dick
larrabee
was
far
more
restive
under
the
village
espionage
than
were
she
and
david
it
was
natural
that
david
should
want
to
leave
beulah
and
make
his
way
in
the
world
and
his
sister
did
not
oppose
it
dick
circumstances
were
different
he
had
inherited
a
small
house
and
farm
from
his
mother
had
enjoyed
a
college
education
and
had
been
offered
a
share
in
a
good
business
in
a
city
twelve
miles
away
he
left
beulah
because
he
hated
it
he
left
because
he
could
not
endure
his
father
gentle
remonstrances
or
the
bewilderment
in
his
stepmother
eyes
she
was
a
newcomer
in
the
household
and
her
glance
seemed
to
say
why
on
earth
do
you
behave
so
badly
to
your
father
when
you
such
a
delightful
chap
he
left
because
deacon
todd
had
prayed
for
him
publicly
at
a
christian
endeavor
meeting
because
popham
had
circulated
a
wholly
baseless
scandal
about
him
and
finally
because
in
his
young
misery
the
only
being
who
could
have
comforted
him
by
joining
her
hapless
fortunes
to
his
had
refused
to
do
so
he
did
know
why
he
had
always
counted
on
letty
when
the
time
should
come
to
speak
the
word
he
had
shown
his
heart
in
everything
but
words
what
more
did
a
girl
want
of
course
if
any
one
preferred
a
purely
fantastic
duty
to
a
man
love
and
allowed
a
scapegrace
brother
to
foist
two
squalling
babies
on
her
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
so
in
this
frame
of
mind
he
had
had
one
flaming
passionate
scene
with
his
father
and
strode
out
of
beulah
with
dramatic
gestures
of
shaking
its
dust
off
his
feet
his
father
roused
for
once
from
his
lifelong
patience
had
been
rather
terrible
in
that
last
scene
so
terrible
that
he
had
never
forgiven
himself
or
really
believed
himself
fully
forgiven
by
god
though
his
son
had
alienated
half
the
village
and
nearly
rent
the
parish
in
twain
by
his
conduct
as
for
letty
she
held
her
peace
she
could
only
hope
that
the
minister
and
his
wife
suspected
nothing
and
she
was
sure
of
point
of
view
that
a
girl
would
never
give
up
a
suitor
if
she
had
any
hope
of
tying
him
to
her
for
life
was
a
popular
form
of
belief
in
the
community
and
strangely
enough
it
was
chiefly
the
women
not
the
men
who
made
it
current
now
and
then
a
and
chivalrous
male
would
observe
indulgently
of
some
village
beauty
i
wonder
a
mite
if
she
could
had
bill
for
the
askin
but
this
opinion
would
be
met
by
such
a
chorus
of
feminine
incredulity
that
its
author
generally
withdrew
it
as
unsound
and
untenable
it
was
then
when
dick
had
gone
away
that
the
days
had
grown
drab
and
long
but
the
twins
kept
letty
inexperienced
hands
busy
though
in
the
first
year
she
had
the
help
of
old
miss
clarissa
perry
a
childless
expert
in
the
of
babies
the
friendship
of
reba
larrabee
so
bright
and
cheery
and
comprehending
was
a
solace
there
was
nothing
of
the
martyr
about
letty
she
was
not
wholly
resigned
to
her
lot
and
to
tell
the
truth
she
did
not
intend
to
be
for
a
good
many
years
yet
i
not
a
minister
but
i
the
wife
of
a
minister
which
is
the
next
best
thing
larrabee
used
to
say
i
tell
you
letty
there
no
use
in
human
creatures
being
resigned
till
their
bodies
are
fairly
worn
out
with
fighting
when
you
ca
think
of
another
mortal
thing
to
do
be
resigned
but
i
convinced
that
the
lord
is
ashamed
of
us
when
we
fold
our
hands
too
soon
you
were
born
courageous
reba
and
letty
would
look
admiringly
at
the
rosy
cheeks
and
bright
eyes
of
her
friend
my
blood
circulates
freely
that
helps
me
a
lot
everybody
blood
circulates
in
racine
wisconsin
and
the
minister
wife
laughed
genially
yours
hereabouts
freezes
up
in
your
six
months
of
cold
weather
and
when
it
begins
to
thaw
out
the
snow
is
ready
to
fall
again
that
sort
of
thing
induces
depression
although
no
mere
climate
would
account
for
mrs
ossian
said
to
luther
the
other
day
ai
hardly
to
blame
parson
she
come
from
a
gloomy
stock
the
ladds
was
all
gloomy
root
and
branch
they
say
that
the
ladd
babies
was
always
discouraged
two
days
after
they
was
born
the
cause
of
letty
chief
heartache
the
one
that
she
could
reveal
to
nobody
was
that
her
brother
should
leave
her
nowadays
so
completely
to
her
own
resources
she
recalled
the
time
when
he
came
home
from
boston
pale
haggard
ashamed
and
told
her
of
his
marriage
months
before
she
could
read
in
his
eyes
and
hear
in
his
voice
the
absence
of
love
the
fear
of
the
future
that
was
bad
enough
but
presently
he
said
letty
there
more
to
tell
i
no
money
and
no
place
to
put
my
wife
but
there
a
child
coming
can
i
bring
her
here
till
afterwards
you
wo
like
her
but
she
so
ailing
and
despondent
just
now
that
i
think
she
behave
herself
and
i
take
her
away
as
soon
as
she
able
to
travel
she
would
never
stay
here
in
the
country
anyway
you
could
hire
her
to
do
it
she
came
eva
with
a
vulgar
beauty
of
her
own
much
damaged
by
bad
temper
discontent
and
illness
oh
those
terrible
weeks
for
letty
hiding
her
own
misery
putting
on
a
brave
face
with
the
neighbors
keeping
the
unwelcome
in
the
background
it
was
bitterly
cold
and
eva
raged
against
the
climate
the
house
the
lack
of
a
servant
the
absence
of
gayety
and
above
all
at
the
prospect
of
motherhood
her
resentment
against
david
for
some
reason
unknown
to
letty
was
deep
and
profound
and
she
made
no
secret
of
it
until
the
outraged
letty
goaded
into
speech
one
day
said
listen
eva
david
brought
you
here
because
his
sister
house
was
the
proper
place
for
you
just
now
i
do
know
why
you
married
each
other
but
you
did
and
it
evidently
a
failure
i
going
to
stand
by
david
and
see
you
through
this
trouble
but
while
you
under
my
roof
have
to
speak
respectfully
of
my
brother
not
so
much
because
he
my
brother
but
because
he
your
husband
and
the
father
of
the
child
that
coming
do
you
understand
letty
had
a
good
deal
of
red
in
her
bronze
hair
and
her
brown
eyes
were
as
capable
of
flashing
fire
as
eva
black
ones
so
the
girl
not
only
refrained
from
venting
her
spleen
upon
the
absent
david
but
ceased
to
talk
altogether
and
the
gloom
in
the
house
was
as
black
as
if
popham
and
all
her
despondent
ancestors
were
living
under
its
roof
the
good
doctor
called
often
and
did
his
best
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
lifting
his
eyebrows
as
he
said
let
her
work
out
her
own
salvation
i
doubt
if
she
can
but
we
give
her
the
chance
if
the
problem
can
be
solved
the
child
will
do
it
illustration
iv
well
the
problem
never
was
solved
never
in
this
world
at
least
and
those
who
were
in
the
chamber
when
eva
was
shown
her
two
babies
lying
side
by
side
on
a
pillow
never
forgot
the
quick
glance
of
horrified
incredulity
or
the
shriek
of
aversion
with
which
she
greeted
them
letty
had
a
sense
of
humor
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
when
the
scorned
and
discarded
babies
were
returned
to
her
and
she
sat
by
the
kitchen
stove
trying
to
plan
a
second
bottle
a
second
cradle
and
see
how
far
the
expected
baby
could
divide
its
modest
outfit
with
the
unexpected
one
she
burst
into
a
fit
of
hysterical
laughter
mingled
with
an
outpour
of
tears
the
doctor
came
in
from
the
puzzled
and
crestfallen
from
his
interview
with
an
entirely
new
specimen
of
he
had
brought
letty
and
david
into
the
world
and
soothed
the
last
days
of
all
her
family
and
now
in
this
tragedy
for
tragedy
it
was
he
was
her
only
confidant
and
adviser
letty
looked
at
him
the
tears
streaming
from
her
eyes
oh
doctor
lee
doctor
lee
if
an
overruling
providence
could
smile
would
he
smile
now
david
and
eva
never
wanted
to
marry
each
other
i
sure
of
it
and
the
last
thing
they
desired
was
a
child
now
there
are
two
of
them
their
father
is
away
their
mother
wo
look
at
them
what
will
become
of
me
until
eva
gets
well
and
behaves
like
a
human
being
i
never
promised
to
be
an
aunt
to
twins
i
never
did
like
twins
i
think
they
downright
vulgar
waly
waly
bairns
are
bonny
one
enough
and
twa
ower
mony
quoted
the
doctor
it
worse
even
than
you
think
my
poor
letty
for
the
girl
ca
get
well
because
she
wo
she
has
gritted
her
teeth
turned
her
face
to
the
wall
and
refused
her
food
it
the
beginning
of
the
end
you
are
far
likelier
to
be
a
foster
mother
than
an
aunt
letty
face
changed
and
softened
and
her
color
rose
she
leaned
over
the
two
pink
crumpled
creatures
still
twitching
nervously
with
the
amazement
and
discomfort
of
being
alive
illustration
come
to
your
aunt
letty
then
and
be
mothered
she
sobbed
come
to
your
aunt
letty
then
and
be
mothered
she
sobbed
lifting
the
pillow
and
taking
it
with
its
double
burden
into
her
arms
you
sha
suffer
poor
innocent
darlings
even
if
those
who
brought
you
into
the
world
turn
away
from
you
come
to
your
aunt
letty
and
be
mothered
that
right
that
right
said
the
doctor
over
a
lump
in
his
throat
we
must
let
the
babies
pay
the
penalty
of
their
sins
and
there
one
thing
that
may
soften
your
anger
a
little
letty
eva
not
right
she
not
quite
responsible
there
are
cases
where
motherhood
that
should
be
a
joy
brings
nothing
but
mental
torture
and
perversion
of
instinct
try
and
remember
that
if
it
helps
you
any
i
drop
in
every
two
or
three
hours
and
i
write
david
to
come
at
once
he
must
take
his
share
of
the
burden
well
david
came
but
eva
was
in
her
coffin
he
was
grave
and
silent
and
it
could
not
be
said
that
he
showed
a
trace
of
fatherly
pride
he
was
very
young
it
is
true
thoroughly
ashamed
of
himself
very
unhappy
and
anxious
about
his
new
cares
but
letty
could
not
help
thinking
that
he
regarded
the
twins
as
a
sort
of
personal
insult
perhaps
not
on
their
own
part
nor
on
eva
but
as
an
accident
that
might
have
been
prevented
by
a
competent
providence
at
any
rate
he
carried
himself
as
a
man
with
a
grievance
and
when
he
looked
at
his
offspring
which
was
seldom
it
seemed
to
letty
that
he
regarded
the
second
one
as
an
unnecessary
intruder
and
cherished
a
secret
resentment
at
its
audacity
in
coming
to
this
planet
uninvited
he
went
back
to
his
work
in
boston
without
its
having
crossed
his
mind
that
anybody
but
his
sister
could
take
care
of
his
children
he
really
regard
them
as
children
or
human
beings
it
takes
a
vision
to
make
that
sort
of
leap
into
the
future
until
a
baby
can
show
some
personal
beauty
evince
some
intellect
stop
squirming
and
squealing
and
exhibit
enough
to
let
people
sleep
at
night
it
is
not
as
a
rule
to
any
one
but
its
mother
david
did
say
vaguely
to
letty
when
he
was
leaving
that
he
hoped
they
would
be
good
the
screams
that
rent
the
air
at
the
precise
moment
of
farewell
rather
giving
the
lie
to
his
hopes
letty
was
struggling
to
end
the
interview
without
breaking
down
for
she
was
worn
out
nervously
as
well
as
physically
and
thought
if
she
could
only
be
alone
with
her
problems
and
her
cares
she
would
rather
write
to
david
than
tell
him
her
mind
face
to
face
brother
and
sister
held
each
other
tightly
for
a
moment
kissed
each
other
and
then
letty
watched
osh
popham
sleigh
slipping
off
with
david
into
the
snowy
distance
the
merry
tinkle
of
the
bells
adding
to
the
sadness
in
her
dreary
heart
dick
gone
yesterday
dave
beulah
without
dick
and
dave
the
two
joys
of
her
life
were
missing
and
in
their
places
two
unknown
babies
whose
digestive
systems
were
going
to
need
constant
watching
according
to
lee
then
she
went
about
with
set
lips
doing
the
last
sordid
things
that
death
brings
in
its
wake
doing
them
as
she
had
seen
her
mother
do
before
her
she
threw
away
the
husks
in
eva
under
mattress
and
put
fresh
ones
in
she
emptied
the
feathers
from
the
feather
bed
and
pillows
and
aired
them
in
the
sun
while
she
washed
the
ticking
she
scrubbed
the
paint
in
the
and
in
between
her
tasks
learned
from
clarissa
perry
the
whole
process
of
bringing
up
babies
by
hand
that
was
three
years
ago
at
first
david
had
sent
ten
dollars
a
month
from
his
slender
earnings
never
omitting
it
save
for
urgent
reasons
he
evidently
thought
of
the
twins
as
company
for
his
sister
and
their
care
a
pleasant
occupation
since
she
had
almost
a
living
income
taking
in
a
few
coats
to
make
just
to
add
an
occasional
luxury
to
the
bare
necessities
of
life
provided
by
her
mother
will
his
letters
were
brief
dispirited
and
infrequent
but
they
had
not
ceased
altogether
till
within
the
last
few
months
during
which
letty
to
him
had
been
returned
from
boston
with
not
found
scribbled
on
the
envelopes
the
firm
in
whose
care
letty
had
latterly
addressed
him
simply
wrote
in
answer
to
her
inquiries
that
gilman
had
not
been
in
their
employ
for
some
time
and
they
had
no
idea
of
his
whereabouts
the
rest
was
silence
illustration
v
a
good
deal
of
water
had
run
under
beulah
bridge
since
letty
boynton
had
sat
at
her
window
on
a
december
evening
unconsciously
furnishing
copy
and
illustration
for
a
christmas
card
yet
there
had
been
very
few
outward
changes
in
the
village
winter
had
melted
into
spring
burst
into
summer
faded
into
autumn
lapsed
into
winter
again
the
same
old
pageant
in
the
world
of
nature
and
the
same
procession
of
incidents
in
the
neighborhood
life
the
harvest
moon
and
the
hunter
moon
had
come
and
gone
the
first
frost
the
family
dinners
and
reunions
at
thanksgiving
the
first
snowfall
and
now
as
christmas
approached
the
same
holiday
spirit
was
abroad
in
the
air
slightly
modified
as
it
passed
by
mournful
visage
one
or
two
babies
had
swelled
the
census
giving
the
minister
hope
of
a
larger
one
or
two
of
the
very
aged
neighbors
had
passed
into
the
beyond
and
a
few
romantic
and
enterprising
young
farmers
had
espoused
wives
among
them
osh
popham
son
the
manner
of
their
choice
was
not
entirely
to
the
liking
of
the
village
digby
popham
had
married
into
the
rival
church
and
as
his
betrothed
was
a
masterful
young
lady
it
was
feared
that
digby
would
leave
larrabee
flock
to
worship
with
his
wife
another
had
married
without
visible
means
of
support
a
proceeding
always
to
be
regretted
by
thoroughly
prudent
persons
over
fifty
and
the
third
deacon
todd
eldest
son
had
somehow
or
other
met
a
siren
from
vermont
and
insisted
on
wedding
her
when
there
were
plenty
of
marriageable
girls
in
beulah
i
no
patience
with
such
actions
grumbled
popham
young
folks
are
so
full
of
notions
nowadays
that
they
look
for
change
and
excitement
everywheres
i
james
todd
thinks
it
a
decent
respectable
way
of
actin
to
turn
his
back
on
the
girls
he
been
brought
up
an
gone
to
school
with
and
court
somebody
he
never
laid
eyes
on
till
a
year
ago
it
a
free
country
but
i
must
say
i
think
it
very
refined
for
a
man
to
go
clear
off
somewheres
and
marry
a
perfect
stranger
births
marriages
and
deaths
however
paled
into
insignificance
compared
with
the
spectacular
début
of
the
minister
wife
as
a
writer
and
embellisher
of
christmas
cards
two
at
least
having
been
seen
at
the
local
milliner
store
how
many
she
had
composed
and
how
many
of
them
said
popham
might
have
been
rejected
nobody
knew
though
there
was
much
speculation
and
more
than
one
citizen
remarked
on
the
size
of
the
daily
package
of
mail
matter
handed
out
by
the
rural
delivery
man
at
the
parsonage
gate
no
one
but
larrabee
and
letty
boynton
were
in
possession
of
all
the
thrilling
details
attending
the
public
appearance
of
these
works
of
art
the
words
and
letters
of
appreciation
the
commendation
and
the
occasional
blows
to
pride
that
attended
their
acceptance
and
publication
larrabee
first
attempt
with
the
sketch
of
letty
at
the
window
on
christmas
eve
her
aglow
her
heart
and
her
door
open
that
love
might
enter
in
if
the
christ
child
came
down
the
snowy
street
this
went
to
the
excelsior
card
company
in
a
large
western
city
and
the
following
correspondence
ensued
luther
larrabee
dear
madam
your
letter
bears
a
postmark
for
my
father
and
my
grandfather
were
born
and
lived
in
new
hampshire
up
beulah
way
i
accept
your
verses
because
of
the
beauty
of
the
picture
that
accompanied
them
and
because
christmas
means
more
than
holly
and
plum
pudding
and
trees
to
me
for
i
am
a
religious
man
a
ministerial
father
and
three
family
deacons
saw
to
that
though
it
does
always
work
that
way
frankly
i
do
not
expect
your
card
to
have
a
wide
appeal
so
i
offer
you
only
five
dollars
a
christmas
card
my
dear
madam
must
have
a
greeting
and
yours
has
none
if
the
pictured
room
were
a
real
room
and
some
one
who
had
seen
or
lived
in
it
should
recognize
it
it
would
attract
his
eye
but
we
can
not
manufacture
cards
to
meet
such
romantic
improbabilities
i
am
emboldened
to
ask
you
because
you
live
in
beulah
if
you
will
not
paint
the
outside
of
some
lonely
little
new
hampshire
cottage
as
humble
as
you
like
and
make
me
some
more
verses
something
say
about
the
folks
back
home
sincerely
yours
reuben
small
beulah
dear
small
i
accept
your
offer
of
five
dollars
for
my
maiden
effort
in
christmas
cards
with
thanks
and
will
try
my
hand
at
something
more
popular
i
am
not
above
liking
to
make
a
wide
appeal
but
the
subject
you
propose
is
rather
a
staggering
one
because
you
accompany
it
with
a
phrase
lacking
rhythm
and
difficult
to
rhyme
you
will
at
once
see
by
running
through
the
alphabet
that
roam
is
the
only
serviceable
rhyme
for
but
the
union
of
the
two
suggests
jingle
or
doggerel
i
defy
any
minor
poet
when
furnished
with
such
a
phrase
to
refrain
from
bursting
at
once
into
no
matter
where
you
travel
no
matter
where
you
roam
you
never
the
folks
back
home
sincerely
yours
reba
larrabee
on
second
thought
i
believe
james
whitcomb
riley
could
do
it
and
overcome
the
difficulties
but
alas
i
have
not
his
touch
dear
larrabee
we
never
refuse
verses
because
they
are
too
good
for
the
public
nothing
is
too
good
for
the
public
but
the
public
must
be
the
judge
of
what
pleases
it
the
folks
back
home
is
a
phrase
that
will
strike
the
eye
and
ear
of
thousands
of
wandering
sons
and
daughters
they
will
choose
that
card
from
the
masses
on
the
counters
and
send
it
to
every
state
in
the
union
if
you
will
glance
at
your
first
card
you
will
see
that
though
people
may
read
it
they
will
always
leave
it
on
the
counter
i
want
my
cards
on
counters
by
the
thousand
but
i
intend
that
they
should
be
left
there
make
an
effort
dear
larrabee
i
could
get
the
folks
back
home
done
here
in
the
office
in
half
an
hour
but
giving
you
the
chance
because
you
live
in
beulah
new
hampshire
and
because
you
make
beautiful
pictures
sincerely
yours
reuben
small
dear
small
i
enclose
a
colored
sketch
of
the
outside
of
the
cottage
whose
i
used
in
my
first
card
i
chose
it
because
i
love
the
person
who
lives
in
it
because
it
always
looks
beautiful
in
the
snow
and
because
the
tree
is
so
picturesque
the
fact
that
it
is
gray
for
lack
of
paint
may
remind
a
casual
wanderer
that
there
is
something
to
do
now
and
then
for
the
folks
back
home
the
verse
is
just
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
it
seems
incredible
that
any
one
should
buy
it
but
ours
is
a
big
country
and
there
are
many
kinds
of
people
living
in
it
so
who
knows
why
you
accept
my
picture
and
then
you
write
the
card
i
could
not
put
my
initials
on
this
they
are
unknown
to
be
sure
and
i
should
want
them
to
be
if
you
use
it
sincerely
yours
reba
larrabee
now
here
a
christmas
greeting
to
the
folks
back
home
it
comes
to
you
across
the
space
dear
folks
back
home
i
searched
the
wide
world
over
but
no
matter
where
i
roam
no
friends
are
like
the
old
friends
no
folks
like
those
back
home
dear
larrabee
i
gave
you
five
dollars
for
the
first
picture
and
verses
which
you
as
a
writer
regard
more
highly
than
i
who
am
merely
a
manufacturer
please
accept
twenty
dollars
for
the
folks
back
home
on
which
i
hope
to
make
up
my
loss
on
the
first
card
i
insist
on
signing
the
despised
verse
with
your
initials
in
case
should
later
come
to
mean
something
you
will
be
glad
that
a
few
thousand
people
have
seen
it
sincerely
reuben
small
the
hessian
soldier
andirons
the
portrait
over
the
boynton
mantel
and
even
letty
boynton
cape
were
identified
on
the
first
card
sooner
or
later
but
it
was
obvious
that
larrabee
had
to
have
a
picture
for
her
verses
and
could
be
supposed
to
make
one
up
out
of
her
head
though
osh
popham
declared
it
had
been
done
again
and
again
in
other
parts
of
the
world
also
it
was
agreed
that
as
letty
face
was
not
distinguishable
nobody
outside
of
beulah
could
recognize
her
by
her
cape
and
that
anyhow
it
could
make
much
difference
for
if
anybody
wanted
to
spend
fifteen
cents
on
a
card
he
would
certainly
buy
the
one
about
the
folks
back
home
the
popularity
of
this
was
established
by
the
fact
that
it
was
selling
not
only
in
beulah
and
greentown
but
in
boston
and
in
racine
wisconsin
and
it
was
rumored
even
in
chicago
the
village
milliner
in
beulah
had
disposed
of
copies
in
thirteen
days
and
the
minister
wife
was
universally
conceded
to
be
the
most
celebrated
person
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire
letty
boynton
had
an
uncomfortable
moment
when
she
saw
the
first
card
but
common
sense
assured
her
that
outside
of
a
handful
of
neighbors
no
one
would
identify
her
home
surroundings
meantime
she
was
proud
of
reba
financial
and
artistic
triumph
in
the
folks
back
home
and
generously
glad
that
she
had
no
share
in
it
twice
during
the
autumn
david
had
broken
his
silence
but
only
to
send
her
a
postal
from
some
western
town
telling
her
that
he
should
have
no
regular
address
for
a
time
that
he
was
traveling
for
a
publishing
firm
and
felt
to
the
business
he
hoped
that
she
and
the
children
were
well
for
he
himself
was
not
etc
the
twins
had
been
photographed
by
osh
popham
who
was
jack
of
all
trades
and
master
of
many
and
a
sight
of
their
dimpled
charms
curly
heads
and
straight
little
bodies
would
have
gladdened
any
heart
letty
thought
however
she
scorned
to
win
david
back
by
any
such
specious
means
if
he
did
care
to
know
whether
his
children
were
or
why
should
she
enlighten
him
this
was
her
usual
frame
of
mind
but
in
these
last
days
of
the
year
how
she
longed
to
pop
the
bewitching
photographs
and
reba
christmas
cards
into
an
envelope
and
send
them
to
david
but
where
no
word
at
all
for
weeks
and
weeks
and
then
only
a
postal
from
joseph
saying
that
he
had
given
up
his
position
on
account
of
poor
health
nothing
in
all
this
to
keep
christmas
on
thought
letty
and
she
knitted
and
crocheted
and
sewed
with
extra
ardor
that
the
twins
stockings
might
be
filled
with
bright
things
of
her
own
making
illustration
vi
on
the
afternoon
before
christmas
of
that
year
the
north
station
in
boston
was
filled
with
hurrying
throngs
on
the
way
home
for
the
holidays
everybody
looked
tired
and
excited
but
most
of
them
had
happy
faces
and
men
and
women
alike
had
as
many
bundles
as
they
could
carry
bundles
and
boxes
quite
unlike
the
brown
paper
ones
with
which
commuters
are
laden
on
ordinary
days
these
were
white
packages
beribboned
and
beflowered
and
behollied
and
bemistletoed
to
be
gently
carried
and
protected
from
crushing
the
train
was
filled
to
overflowing
and
many
stood
in
the
aisles
until
latham
junction
was
reached
and
the
overflow
alighted
to
change
cars
for
greentown
and
way
stations
among
the
crowd
were
two
men
with
who
hurried
into
the
way
train
and
entering
the
smoking
car
from
opposite
ends
met
in
the
middle
of
the
aisle
dropped
their
encumbrances
stretched
out
a
hand
and
ejaculated
in
the
same
breath
dick
larrabee
upon
my
word
dave
gilman
by
all
that
great
here
let
turn
over
a
seat
for
our
baggage
and
sit
together
going
home
i
the
men
had
not
met
for
some
years
but
each
knew
something
of
the
other
circumstances
and
hoped
that
the
other
did
know
too
much
they
scanned
each
other
faces
dick
thinking
that
david
looked
pinched
and
pale
david
registering
the
quick
impression
that
dick
was
prosperous
yes
david
answered
i
going
home
for
a
couple
of
days
it
such
a
confounded
journey
to
that
village
that
a
business
man
ca
get
there
but
once
in
a
generation
awful
hole
confirmed
dick
simply
awful
hole
i
did
get
it
out
of
my
system
for
years
married
asked
david
no
rather
think
i
not
the
marrying
kind
though
the
fact
is
had
no
time
for
love
affairs
too
busy
let
see
you
have
a
child
have
you
yes
letty
has
seen
to
all
that
business
for
me
since
my
wife
died
wild
horses
could
have
dragged
the
information
from
him
that
the
child
was
twins
and
dick
did
need
it
anyway
for
he
had
heard
the
news
the
morning
he
left
beulah
wonder
if
there
have
been
many
changes
in
the
village
do
know
there
never
used
to
be
popham
has
been
ailing
for
years
she
could
die
and
deacon
todd
would
dick
old
animosities
still
lingered
faintly
in
his
memory
though
his
laughing
voice
and
the
twinkle
in
his
eyes
showed
plainly
that
no
bitterness
was
left
how
business
with
you
david
only
i
had
the
devil
own
luck
lately
ca
get
anything
that
suits
me
or
that
pays
a
decent
income
i
formed
a
new
connection
the
other
day
but
i
ca
say
yet
what
there
is
in
it
i
just
out
of
hospital
operation
they
cut
out
the
wrong
thing
first
i
believe
sewed
me
up
then
remembered
it
was
the
other
thing
and
did
it
over
again
at
any
rate
that
the
only
way
i
can
account
for
their
mewing
me
up
there
for
two
months
well
well
that
is
hard
luck
i
sorry
old
boy
things
begin
to
go
my
way
either
till
within
the
last
few
months
i
always
made
a
fair
living
and
saved
a
little
money
but
never
gained
any
real
headway
now
i
got
a
start
and
the
future
looks
pretty
favorable
and
best
of
all
pretty
no
trouble
at
home
calls
you
back
to
beulah
i
hope
letty
is
all
right
dick
cast
an
anxious
side
glance
at
david
though
he
spoke
carelessly
oh
no
everything
serene
so
far
as
i
know
i
a
poor
correspondent
especially
when
i
no
good
news
to
tell
and
anyway
the
mere
sight
of
a
pen
ties
my
tongue
i
just
running
down
to
surprise
letty
dick
looked
at
david
again
he
began
to
think
he
did
like
him
he
used
to
when
they
were
boys
but
when
he
brought
that
unaccountable
wife
home
and
foisted
her
and
her
babies
on
letty
he
rather
turned
against
him
david
was
younger
than
himself
four
or
five
years
younger
but
he
looked
as
if
he
had
grown
up
surely
his
boyhood
chum
had
used
to
be
so
pale
and
or
his
mouth
so
ladylike
and
pretty
a
good
face
though
straight
and
clean
with
honest
eyes
and
a
likable
smile
lack
of
will
perhaps
or
a
persistent
run
of
ill
luck
letty
had
always
kept
him
stiffened
up
in
the
old
days
dick
recalled
one
of
his
father
phrases
to
the
effect
that
dave
gilman
would
spin
on
a
very
small
biscuit
and
wondered
if
it
were
still
true
and
you
dick
your
father
still
living
you
see
i
have
kept
up
with
beulah
lately
keeping
up
with
beulah
it
sounds
like
the
title
of
a
novel
but
the
hero
would
have
to
be
a
snail
or
he
pass
beulah
in
the
first
chapter
yes
father
hale
and
hearty
i
believe
you
come
home
every
christmas
i
inquired
david
no
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
is
my
first
visit
since
i
left
for
good
that
about
my
case
and
david
hung
his
head
a
little
unconsciously
that
so
well
i
was
a
fool
when
i
said
to
beulah
and
it
taken
me
all
this
time
to
cool
off
and
make
up
my
mind
to
apologize
to
the
dad
there
there
rather
a
queer
coincidence
about
my
visit
just
at
this
time
speaking
of
coincidences
said
david
i
can
beat
yours
whatever
it
is
if
the
thought
of
your
father
brought
you
back
my
mother
drew
me
this
way
and
he
took
something
from
his
inside
coat
do
you
see
that
dick
regarded
the
object
blankly
then
with
a
quick
gesture
dived
into
his
pocket
and
brought
forth
another
of
the
same
general
character
how
about
this
he
asked
each
had
one
of
reba
larrabee
christmas
cards
but
david
had
the
first
unsuccessful
one
and
dick
the
popular
one
with
the
lonely
little
gray
house
and
the
verse
about
the
folks
back
home
the
men
looked
at
each
other
in
astonishment
and
dick
gave
a
low
whistle
then
they
bent
over
the
cards
together
it
was
mother
picture
that
pulled
me
back
to
beulah
i
do
mind
telling
you
said
david
his
mouth
twitching
do
you
see
it
oh
is
that
your
mother
and
dick
scanned
the
card
closely
do
you
remember
her
portrait
that
always
hung
there
after
she
died
yes
of
course
and
dick
tone
was
apologetic
you
see
the
face
is
so
small
i
did
notice
it
but
i
recognize
it
now
and
remember
the
portrait
then
the
old
exclaimed
david
look
at
the
rag
carpet
and
the
blessed
old
andirons
gracious
i
crawled
round
those
hessian
soldiers
burned
my
fingers
and
cracked
my
skull
on
often
enough
when
i
was
a
kid
when
i
studied
the
card
five
minutes
i
bought
a
ticket
and
started
for
home
david
eyes
were
suffused
and
his
lip
trembled
i
do
wonder
said
dick
i
recognize
the
dear
old
room
right
enough
and
of
course
i
should
know
letty
it
did
occur
to
me
that
it
letty
for
some
time
said
her
brother
there
just
the
glimpse
of
a
face
shown
and
no
real
likeness
perhaps
not
agreed
dick
a
stranger
would
have
known
it
for
letty
but
if
it
had
been
only
that
cape
i
should
have
guessed
as
familiar
as
popham
bugle
bonnet
and
much
prettier
she
wore
it
every
winter
skating
you
know
and
it
just
the
color
of
her
hair
letty
has
a
head
said
david
judicially
it
shows
even
in
the
card
and
a
remarkable
ear
added
dick
so
small
and
so
close
to
her
head
i
never
notice
people
ears
confessed
david
do
you
i
do
and
eyelashes
too
mother
got
letty
eyelashes
down
she
changed
dave
letty
has
that
hurts
me
she
was
always
so
gay
and
chirpy
in
this
picture
she
has
a
sad
listening
look
but
mother
may
have
put
that
in
just
to
make
it
interesting
or
perhaps
i
had
something
to
do
with
the
change
of
expression
thought
david
what
attracted
me
first
he
added
was
your
mother
verses
she
always
had
a
knack
of
being
pious
without
cramming
piety
down
your
throat
i
liked
that
open
door
it
meant
welcome
no
matter
how
little
you
deserved
it
where
you
get
your
card
dave
asked
dick
it
prettier
than
mine
a
nurse
brought
it
to
me
in
the
hospital
just
because
she
took
a
fancy
to
it
she
did
know
it
would
mean
anything
to
me
but
it
did
a
relapse
and
david
laughed
shamedfacedly
i
guess
confine
herself
to
beef
tea
after
this
where
you
get
yours
picked
it
up
on
a
dentist
mantelpiece
when
i
was
waiting
for
an
appointment
i
was
traveling
round
the
room
hands
in
my
pockets
when
suddenly
i
saw
this
card
standing
up
against
an
the
color
caught
me
i
took
it
to
the
window
and
at
first
i
was
puzzled
it
certainly
was
letty
house
the
door
open
you
see
and
somebody
in
the
window
i
knew
it
was
letty
but
how
could
any
card
publisher
have
found
the
way
to
beulah
then
i
discovered
initials
snarled
up
in
holly
and
remembered
that
she
was
always
painting
and
illuminating
queer
job
life
is
said
david
putting
his
card
back
in
his
pocket
and
wishing
there
were
a
little
more
time
or
that
he
had
a
little
more
courage
so
that
he
might
confide
in
dick
larrabee
he
felt
a
desire
to
tell
him
some
of
the
wretchedness
he
had
lived
through
it
would
be
a
comfort
just
to
hint
that
his
unhappiness
had
made
him
a
coward
so
that
the
very
responsibilities
that
serve
as
a
spur
to
some
men
had
left
him
until
now
cold
unstirred
unvitalized
you
right
dick
answered
life
is
a
queer
job
and
it
does
do
to
shirk
it
and
just
as
queer
as
anything
in
life
is
the
way
that
mother
christmas
cards
brought
us
back
to
beulah
they
acted
as
a
sort
of
magic
did
they
jiminy
i
believe
the
next
station
is
beulah
i
hope
the
depot
team
will
be
hitched
up
yes
here
we
are
seven
and
the
train
only
minutes
late
it
always
made
a
point
of
that
on
holidays
never
mind
and
dick
tone
was
as
gay
as
david
was
sober
the
will
have
gone
back
to
the
cellarway
and
the
doughnuts
to
the
crock
but
the
back
home
get
out
for
us
and
a
mince
pie
too
and
a
cut
of
sage
cheese
there
wo
be
any
back
home
we
so
late
i
thinking
there
always
a
christmas
eve
festival
at
the
church
you
know
they
never
change
in
beulah
then
by
george
they
can
have
me
for
santa
claus
said
dick
as
they
stepped
out
on
the
platform
why
it
does
seem
cold
at
all
yet
look
at
the
ice
on
the
river
what
skating
and
what
a
moon
my
blood
up
and
if
i
find
the
parsonage
closed
i
follow
on
to
the
church
and
make
my
peace
with
the
members
there
a
kind
of
spell
on
me
for
the
first
time
in
years
i
feel
as
though
i
could
shake
hands
with
deacon
todd
well
merry
christmas
to
you
dick
i
going
to
walk
good
gracious
have
you
come
to
spend
the
winter
for
various
bags
and
parcels
were
being
flung
out
on
the
platform
with
that
indifference
and
irresponsibility
that
bespeak
the
touch
of
the
seasoned
you
did
suppose
i
was
coming
back
to
beulah
on
christmas
eve
did
you
if
i
in
time
for
the
tree
i
going
to
give
those
little
youngsters
something
to
remember
jump
in
dave
and
ride
as
far
as
the
turn
of
the
road
in
a
few
minutes
the
tottering
old
that
marked
the
way
to
beulah
center
hove
in
sight
and
david
jumped
from
the
sleigh
to
take
his
homeward
path
merry
christmas
again
dick
he
waved
same
to
you
dave
i
come
myself
to
say
it
to
letty
the
first
minute
i
see
smoke
coming
from
your
chimney
morning
tell
her
you
met
me
will
you
and
that
my
visit
is
partly
for
her
only
that
father
had
to
have
his
turn
first
she
know
why
tell
her
mother
card
had
christmas
magic
in
it
tell
say
tell
her
the
rest
yourself
will
you
dick
and
dave
broke
into
a
run
down
the
hill
road
that
led
to
letty
i
will
indeed
breathed
dick
into
his
muffler
illustration
vii
repeating
history
letty
was
again
at
her
open
window
she
had
been
to
reproduce
the
card
as
it
were
but
something
impelled
her
she
was
safe
from
scrutiny
too
for
everybody
had
gone
to
the
tree
the
pophams
davis
clarissa
perry
everybody
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
up
and
down
the
street
and
by
now
the
company
would
be
gathered
and
the
tree
lighted
she
could
keep
watch
alone
the
only
sound
being
that
of
the
children
soft
breathing
in
the
next
room
letty
had
longed
to
go
to
the
festival
herself
but
old
clarissa
perry
who
cared
for
the
twins
now
and
then
in
letty
few
absences
had
a
niece
who
was
going
to
speak
a
piece
and
she
yearned
to
be
present
and
share
in
the
glory
so
letty
was
kept
at
home
as
she
had
been
numberless
other
times
during
the
three
years
of
her
vicarious
motherhood
the
night
was
mild
again
as
in
the
year
before
the
snow
lay
like
white
powder
on
the
hard
earth
the
moon
was
full
and
the
street
was
a
length
of
dazzling
silence
the
lighted
candle
was
in
the
parlor
window
shining
toward
the
the
fire
burned
brightly
on
the
hearth
the
front
door
was
ajar
letty
wrapped
her
old
cape
round
her
shoulders
drew
her
hood
over
her
head
and
seating
herself
at
the
window
repeated
under
her
breath
my
door
is
on
the
latch
the
is
aglow
i
seem
to
hear
swift
passing
feet
the
christ
child
in
the
snow
my
heart
is
open
wide
for
stranger
kith
or
kin
i
would
not
bar
a
single
door
where
love
might
enter
in
and
then
a
footstep
drawing
ever
nearer
sounded
crunch
crunch
in
the
snow
letty
pushed
her
chair
back
into
the
shadow
the
footstep
halted
at
the
gate
came
falteringly
up
the
path
turned
aside
and
came
nearer
the
window
then
a
voice
said
do
be
frightened
letty
it
david
can
i
come
in
i
have
any
right
to
except
that
christmas
eve
that
indeed
was
the
magic
the
phrase
that
swept
the
past
out
of
mind
with
one
swift
stroke
the
acknowledgment
of
unworthiness
the
claim
on
the
forgiving
love
that
should
be
in
every
heart
on
such
a
night
as
this
resentment
melted
away
like
mist
before
the
sun
her
deep
grievance
where
had
it
gone
how
could
she
speak
anything
but
welcome
for
what
was
the
window
open
the
fire
lighted
the
door
ajar
the
guiding
but
that
love
and
david
might
enter
in
there
were
few
words
at
first
nothing
but
hands
and
wet
cheeks
pressed
together
then
letty
sent
david
into
the
room
by
himself
if
the
twins
were
bewitching
when
awake
they
were
nothing
short
of
angelic
when
asleep
illustration
i
never
thought
of
them
as
my
children
before
david
came
out
a
little
later
his
eyes
reddened
with
tears
his
hair
rumpled
his
face
flushed
he
seemed
like
a
man
awed
by
an
entirely
new
experience
he
could
not
speak
he
could
only
stammer
brokenly
as
god
is
my
witness
letty
there
been
something
wrong
with
me
up
to
this
moment
i
never
thought
of
them
as
my
children
before
and
i
ca
believe
that
such
as
they
can
belong
to
me
they
were
never
wanted
and
i
never
had
any
interest
in
them
i
owe
them
to
you
letty
you
made
them
what
they
are
you
and
no
one
else
if
there
had
been
something
there
to
build
on
my
love
and
care
would
have
counted
for
much
they
just
like
dear
mother
people
for
good
looks
and
brains
and
pretty
manners
they
pure
shirley
all
the
way
through
the
twinnies
are
it
lucky
for
me
that
they
are
said
david
humbly
you
see
letty
i
married
eva
to
keep
my
promise
if
i
was
old
enough
to
make
it
i
was
old
enough
to
keep
it
so
i
thought
she
never
loved
me
and
when
she
found
out
that
i
did
love
her
any
longer
she
turned
against
me
our
life
together
was
awful
from
beginning
to
end
but
she
in
her
grave
and
nobody
ever
hear
my
side
now
that
she
ca
tell
hers
when
i
looked
at
those
two
babies
the
day
i
left
you
i
thought
of
them
only
as
retribution
and
the
vision
of
them
ugly
wrinkled
writhing
little
creatures
has
been
in
my
mind
ever
since
they
were
compensation
not
retribution
david
i
ought
to
have
told
you
how
clever
and
beautiful
they
were
but
you
never
asked
and
my
pride
was
up
in
arms
a
man
should
stand
by
his
own
flesh
and
blood
even
if
it
is
attractive
that
what
i
believe
i
know
i
know
but
i
had
no
feeling
for
three
years
i
been
like
a
frozen
man
just
drifting
trying
to
make
both
ends
meet
my
heart
dead
and
my
body
full
of
pain
i
just
out
of
a
hospital
two
months
in
all
david
why
did
you
let
me
know
or
send
for
me
oh
it
was
way
out
in
missouri
i
was
taken
ill
very
suddenly
at
the
hotel
in
joseph
and
they
moved
me
at
once
there
were
two
operations
first
and
last
and
i
did
know
enough
to
feed
myself
most
of
the
time
poor
poor
buddy
did
you
have
good
care
the
best
i
had
more
than
care
ruth
bentley
the
nurse
that
brought
me
back
to
life
made
me
see
what
a
useless
creature
i
was
some
woman
instinct
stirred
in
letty
at
a
new
note
in
her
voice
and
a
new
look
in
his
face
she
braced
herself
for
his
next
words
sure
that
they
would
open
a
fresh
chapter
the
door
and
the
window
were
closed
now
the
shades
pulled
down
the
fire
low
the
hour
was
ripe
for
confidences
you
see
letty
and
david
cleared
his
throat
nervously
and
looked
at
the
coals
gleaming
behind
the
hessian
soldiers
it
a
time
for
a
thorough
housecleaning
body
mind
and
soul
a
long
illness
is
and
miss
bentley
knew
well
enough
that
all
was
wrong
with
me
i
mentioned
my
unhappy
marriage
and
told
her
all
about
you
but
i
said
nothing
about
the
children
why
should
you
asked
letty
although
her
mind
had
leaped
to
the
reason
already
well
i
was
a
poor
patient
in
one
of
the
cheapest
rooms
broken
in
health
without
any
present
means
of
support
i
wanted
to
stand
well
with
her
she
had
been
so
good
to
me
and
i
thought
if
she
knew
about
the
twins
she
would
believe
i
could
ever
make
a
living
for
three
still
less
for
put
in
letty
with
an
irrepressible
note
of
teasing
in
her
tone
she
had
broken
the
ice
like
a
torrent
set
free
david
dashed
into
the
story
of
the
last
two
months
and
ruth
bentley
wonderful
influence
how
she
had
recreated
him
within
as
well
as
without
how
she
was
the
best
and
noblest
of
women
willing
to
take
a
pauper
by
the
hand
and
brace
him
up
for
a
new
battle
with
life
strength
appeals
to
me
confessed
david
perhaps
it
because
i
am
weak
for
i
afraid
i
am
a
little
be
careful
davy
eva
was
strong
david
shuddered
he
remembered
a
strength
that
lashed
and
buffeted
and
struck
and
overpowered
ruth
is
different
he
said
of
the
strong
came
forth
sweetness
used
to
be
one
of
parson
larrabee
texts
that
kind
of
can
i
will
you
let
me
bring
her
here
to
see
you
letty
say
for
new
year
it
all
so
different
from
the
last
time
i
asked
you
then
i
knew
i
was
bringing
you
nothing
but
sorrow
and
pain
but
ruth
carries
her
welcome
in
her
face
the
prop
inside
of
letty
wavered
unsteadily
for
a
moment
and
then
stood
in
its
accustomed
upright
position
why
not
she
asked
it
the
right
thing
to
do
but
you
must
tell
her
about
the
children
first
oh
i
did
that
long
ago
after
i
found
out
that
she
cared
it
was
only
at
first
that
i
did
dare
i
have
told
you
but
she
went
out
for
her
daily
walk
and
brought
me
home
a
christmas
card
the
prettiest
one
she
could
find
she
said
i
was
propped
up
on
pillows
as
weak
as
a
kitten
i
looked
at
it
and
looked
at
it
and
when
i
saw
that
it
was
this
room
the
old
fireplace
and
mother
picture
and
the
hessian
soldier
andirons
when
i
realized
there
was
a
face
at
the
window
and
that
the
door
was
ajar
everything
just
swam
before
me
and
i
fainted
dead
away
i
had
a
relapse
and
when
i
was
better
again
i
told
her
everything
she
fond
of
children
it
did
make
any
difference
except
for
her
to
say
that
the
more
she
had
to
do
for
me
the
more
she
wanted
to
do
it
well
said
letty
with
a
break
in
her
voice
that
love
so
far
as
i
can
see
and
if
you
been
lucky
enough
to
win
it
take
it
and
be
thankful
and
above
all
nurse
and
keep
so
one
of
reba
cards
the
one
the
publisher
thought
would
never
sell
found
you
and
brought
you
back
how
wonderful
we
little
thought
of
that
reba
and
i
reba
work
did
stop
there
letty
there
was
so
much
that
had
to
be
said
between
you
and
me
just
now
that
i
could
let
another
subject
creep
in
till
it
was
finished
and
we
were
friends
but
dick
larrabee
saw
reba
card
about
folks
back
home
in
chicago
and
he
bought
a
ticket
for
beulah
just
as
i
did
we
met
in
the
train
and
compared
notes
dick
larrabee
home
the
blood
started
in
letty
heart
and
sped
hither
and
thither
warming
her
from
head
to
foot
yes
looking
as
fit
as
a
fiddle
the
way
a
man
looks
when
things
are
coming
his
way
but
what
did
the
card
mean
to
him
did
he
seem
to
like
verses
yes
but
i
guess
the
card
just
spelled
home
to
him
and
he
recognized
this
house
in
a
minute
of
course
i
showed
him
my
card
and
he
said
letty
fast
enough
i
know
the
cape
he
recognized
you
in
a
minute
he
said
he
knew
the
cape
yes
the
old
cape
had
been
close
to
his
shoulder
many
a
time
he
liked
it
and
said
it
matched
her
hair
he
was
awfully
funny
about
your
ear
too
i
told
him
i
never
noticed
women
ears
and
he
said
he
did
when
they
were
pretty
and
their
eyelashes
anything
remarkable
about
your
eyelashes
letty
nothing
that
i
aware
of
said
letty
laughingly
although
she
was
fibbing
and
she
knew
it
and
he
said
he
call
and
say
christmas
to
you
the
first
thing
that
he
would
have
been
here
but
you
know
his
father
had
to
come
first
you
do
mind
being
second
to
the
parson
do
you
no
letty
did
mind
her
heart
was
unaccountably
light
and
glad
like
a
girl
heart
it
was
the
eve
of
mary
when
all
women
are
blest
because
of
one
the
wise
men
brought
gifts
to
the
child
letty
had
often
brought
hers
timidly
devoutly
trustfully
and
perhaps
they
were
coming
back
to
her
illustration
viii
put
the
things
down
on
the
front
steps
said
dick
to
the
driver
as
he
neared
the
parsonage
if
there
nobody
at
home
i
go
on
up
to
the
church
after
i
got
this
stuff
inside
got
a
key
no
do
need
one
i
picked
all
the
locks
with
a
penknife
many
a
time
besides
the
key
is
sure
to
be
under
the
doormat
yes
here
it
is
of
all
the
unaccountable
customs
i
ever
knew
that
the
most
laughable
works
all
right
for
you
yes
and
for
all
the
other
tramps
and
dick
opened
the
door
and
lifted
in
his
belongings
he
called
to
the
driver
walk
up
to
the
church
after
i
found
out
whether
mother
keeps
the
mince
pie
and
cider
apple
sauce
in
the
same
old
place
a
few
minutes
later
his
hunger
partially
stayed
dick
larrabee
locked
the
parsonage
door
and
took
the
path
across
the
church
common
it
was
his
father
feet
he
knew
that
had
worn
the
shoveled
path
so
smooth
his
kind
faithful
feet
that
had
sped
to
and
fro
on
errands
of
mercy
never
faltering
in
all
the
years
it
was
nearly
eight
the
sound
of
the
melodeon
with
children
voices
floated
out
from
the
all
ablaze
with
light
or
as
much
ablaze
as
a
kerosene
chandelier
and
six
side
lamps
could
make
it
the
horse
sheds
were
crowded
with
teams
of
various
sorts
the
horses
well
blanketed
and
standing
comfortably
in
straw
and
the
last
straggler
was
entering
the
door
of
the
church
as
dick
neared
the
steps
simultaneously
the
door
opened
and
on
the
background
of
the
light
inside
appeared
the
figure
of
todd
the
wife
of
his
ancient
enemy
the
senior
deacon
dick
could
see
that
a
sort
of
had
been
curtained
off
in
the
little
entry
as
it
had
often
been
in
former
times
of
tableaux
and
concerts
and
what
not
valor
not
discretion
was
the
better
policy
and
walking
boldly
up
to
the
steps
dick
took
off
his
fur
cap
and
said
mrs
todd
good
gracious
me
where
under
the
canopy
did
you
hail
from
dick
larrabee
was
your
folks
lookin
for
you
they
ai
breathed
a
word
to
none
of
us
no
i
a
surprise
mrs
todd
well
i
know
you
given
me
one
will
you
wait
a
spell
till
the
recitations
is
over
you
scare
the
children
so
if

the
mustard

like

dick
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
he
had

just
how
unexpected
beulah
point
of
view
always
was
deacon
todd
now
came
out
cautiously
i
got
it
on
him
mother
tho
he
terrible
unresigned
to
it
i
given
him
a
stiff
dose
o
jamaica
ginger
we
can
tell
pretty
soon
whether
he
can
take
his
part
here
dick
larrabee
come
back
isaac
just
when
we
thought
he
had
given
up
beulah
for
good
an
all
said
todd
the
deacon
stood
on
the
top
step
his
gaunt
grizzled
face
peering
above
the
collar
of
his
great
coat
not
a
man
to
eat
his
words
very
often
deacon
isaac
todd
well
young
man
he
said
you
found
your
way
home
have
you
it
about
time
if
you
want
to
see
your
father
alive
if
it
had
been
for
you
and
others
like
you
men
who
had
forgotten
what
it
was
to
be
young
i
should
never
have
gone
away
said
dick
hotly
what
had
i
done
worse
than
a
dozen
others
only
that
i
happened
to
be
the
minister
son
that
just
it
you
were
bringin
trouble
on
the
parish
makin
talk
that
reflected
on
your
father
folks
said
if
he
could
control
his
own
son
he
fit
to
manage
a
church
you
played
cards
you
danced
you
drove
a
fast
horse
i
never
did
a
thing
i
ashamed
of
but
one
and
dick
voice
was
firm
my
misdeeds
were
nothing
but
boyish
nonsense
but
the
village
never
gave
me
credit
for
a
single
virtue
i
ought
to
have
remembered
father
position
but
whatever
i
was
or
whatever
i
did
you
had
no
right
to
pray
for
me
openly
for
full
five
minutes
at
a
public
meeting
that
galled
me
worse
than
anything
now
isaac
interrupted
todd
i
hope
you
believe
me
told
you
once
a
week
on
an
average
these
last
three
years
that
you
might
have
chastened
dick
some
other
way
besides
prayin
for
him
in
meetin
the
deacon
smiled
grimly
you
both
talk
as
if
prayin
was
one
of
the
seven
deadly
sins
he
said
i
not
objecting
to
your
prayers
agreed
dick
but
there
were
plenty
of
closets
in
your
house
where
you
might
have
gone
and
told
the
lord
your
opinion
of
me
only
that
was
good
enough
for
you
you
must
needs
tell
the
whole
village
there
father
that
what
i
always
said
agreed
todd
well
i
ai
one
that
ca
yield
when
the
majority
against
me
said
the
deacon
particularly
when
i
treatin
john
trimble
for
the
colic
if
you
stop
actin
so
you
threaten
to
split
the
church
dick
larrabee
i
stop
prayin
for
you
the
lord
knows
how
i
feel
about
it
now
so
i
need
keep
on
remindin
him

ix
that

bargain

dick

me
be
santa
claus
come
on
in
and
let
look
at
john
trimble
he

a
splendid
job
or
jeremiah
but
i
would
let
him
spoil
a
christmas
festival
do
let
dick
take
the
part
father
and
todd
tone
was
most
ingratiating
john
terrible
dull
and
bashful
anyway
an
mebbe
have
a
pain
he
could
stan
jest
when
he
givin
out
the
presents
an
dick
is
always
so
amusin
deacon
todd
led
the
way
into
the
improvised
he
had
removed
john
gala
costume
in
order
to
apply
the
mustard
faithfully
and
he
lay
in
a
crumpled
heap
in
the
corner
the
plaster
itself
adorned
a
stool
near
by
now
john
john
that
plaster
wo
do
you
no
good
on
the
stool
it
ai
the
stool
that
needs
drawin
it
your
stomach
argued
todd
i
drawed
pretty
nigh
to
death
moaned
john
i
rore
that
what
i
am
rore
an
i
wo
be

i
want

go
home
wrop

up
and
get
him
into
your
sleigh
father
and
take
him
home
then
come
right
back
bed
the
place
for
him
keep
that
hot
on
his
stomach
if
he
rather
have
it
than
the
mustard
are
such
cowards
i
dress
dick
while
you
gone
mebbe
it
a
providence
on
the
whole
dick
agreed
with
todd
as
he
stood
ready
to
make
his
entrance
the
school
committee
was
in
the
church
and
he
had
had
much
to
do
with
its
members
in
former
days
the
of
the
village
were
present
and
he
had
made
their
acquaintance
once
in
an
executive
session
the
deacons
were
all
there
and
the
pillars
of
the
church
and
the
choir
and
the
organist
a
spinster
who
had
actively
disapproved
when
he
had
put
beans
in
the
melodeon
one
sunday
yes
it
was
best
to
meet
them
in
a
body
on
a
festive
occasion
like
this
when
the
rigors
of
the
village
point
of
view
were
relaxed
it
would
relieve
him
of
several
dozen
private
visits
of
apology
and
altogether
he
felt
that
his
courage
would
have
wavered
had
he
not
been
disguised
as
another
person
altogether
a
popular
favorite
a
fat
jolly
rollicking
dispenser
of
bounties
to
the
general
public
when
he
finally
discarded
his
costume
would
it
not
be
easier
too
to
meet
his
father
first
before
the
church
full
of
people
and
have
the
solemn
hour
with
him
alone
later
at
night
yes
as
todd
said
mebbe
was
a
providence
there
was
never
such
a
merry
christmas
festival
in
the
orthodox
church
of
beulah
everybody
was
of
one
mind
as
to
that
there
was
a
momentary
fear
that
john
trimble
a
pillar
of
prohibition
might
have
imbibed
hard
cider
so
gay
so
nimble
so
was
santa
claus
when
was
john
trimble
ever
known
to
unbend
sufficiently
to
romp
up
the
side
aisle
jingling
his
sleigh
bells
and
leap
over
a
front
pew
stuffed
with
presents
to
gain
the
he
needed
for
the
distribution
of
his
pack
the
wing
pews
on
one
side
of
the
pulpit
had
been
floored
over
and
the
christmas
tree
stood
there
triumphant
in
beauty
while
the
gifts
strewed
the
platform
at
its
feet
how
gay
how
audacious
how
witty
was
santa
claus
how
the
village
had
always
misjudged
john
trimble
and
how
completely
had
john
trimble
hitherto
obscured
his
light
under
a
bushel
in
his
own
proper
person
children
avoided
him
but
they
crowded
about
this
santa
claus
encircling
his
legs
gurgling
with
joy
when
they
were
lifted
to
his
shoulder
their
laughter
ringing
through
the
church
at
his
droll
antics
a
sense
of
mystery
grew
when
he
opened
a
pack
on
the
pulpit
stairs
a
pack
unfamiliar
in
its
outward
aspect
to
the
committee
on
entertainment
every
girl
had
a
little
doll
dressed
in
fashionable
attire
and
every
boy
a
brilliantly
colored
splendidly
noisy
tin
trumpet
but
hanging
to
every
toy
by
a
red
ribbon
was
christmas
card
her
despised
one
about
the
folks
back
home
illustration
hands
that
trembled
as
everybody
could
see
the
publishers
check
to
the
minister
wife
had
been
accompanied
by
a
dozen
complimentary
copies
but
these
had
been
sent
to
reba
western
friends
and
relations
and
although
the
card
was
on
many
a
table
in
beulah
it
had
not
been
bought
by
all
the
inhabitants
by
any
means
fifteen
cents
would
purchase
something
useful
and
beulah
did
not
contain
many
croesuses
still
here
the
cards
were
enough
of
them
for
everybody
with
a
linen
handkerchief
for
every
woman
and
every
man
in
the
and
a
dozen
more
sticking
out
of
the
pack
as
the
people
in
the
front
pews
could
plainly
see
modest
gifts
but
plenty
of
them
and
nobody
knew
from
whence
they
came
there
was
a
buzzing
in
the
church
a
buzzing
that
grew
louder
and
more
persistent
when
santa
claus
threw
a
lace
scarf
around
larrabee
shoulders
and
approached
her
husband
with
a
fine
beaver
collar
in
his
hands
hands
that
trembled
as
everybody
could
see
when
he
buttoned
the
piece
of
fur
around
the
old
neck
and
the
minister
he
had
been
half
in
and
half
out
of
a
puzzling
dream
for
ten
minutes
and
when
those
hands
of
santa
claus
touched
him
his
flesh
quivered
they
reminded
him
of
baby
fingers
that
had
crept
around
his
neck
years
ago
when
he
patiently
walked
the
parsonage
floor
at
night
with
his
ailing
child
in
his
arms
every
drop
of
blood
in
his
veins
called
out
for
answer
he
looked
above
the
white
cotton
beard
and
mustache
to
a
pair
of
dark
eyes
merry
mischievous
yet
tender
and
soft
at
a
brown
wavy
lock
escaping
from
the
wig
then
those
who
were
near
heard
a
weak
voice
say
my
son
and
those
who
were
far
away
observed
santa
claus
tear
off
his
wig
and
beard
heard
him
cry
father
and
as
todd
said
afterwards
saw
him
fall
on
to
the
minister
neck
right
there
before
the
whole
caboodle
an
cling
to
him
for
all
the
world
like
an
engaged
couple
only
they
would
made
so
free
in
public
no
ice
but
would
have
thawed
in
such
an
atmosphere
beulah
forgot
how
much
trouble
dick
larrabee
had
caused
in
other
days
and
the
children
had
found
a
friend
for
all
time
the
extraordinary
number
of
dolls
trumpets
handkerchiefs
and
christmas
cards
circulating
in
the
raised
the
temperature
considerably
and
induced
a
general
feeling
that
if
dick
larrabee
had
really
ever
been
a
bit
wild
and
reckless
he
had
evidently
reformed
and
prospered
besides
yes
no
one
but
a
kind
and
omniscient
providence
could
have
so
beautifully
arranged
dick
larrabee
homecoming
and
so
wisely
superintended
his
complete
reinstatement
in
the
good
graces
of
beulah
village
a
few
maiden
ladies
felt
that
he
had
been
a
trifle
immodest
in
embracing
and
especially
in
kissing
his
father
in
front
of
the
congregation
venturing
the
conviction
that
kissing
an
indecorous
custom
in
any
event
was
especially
lamentable
in
public
pity
letty
boynton
missed
this
evenin
said
todd
her
dick
allers
had
a
fancy
for
each
other
so
i
heard
though
i
know
how
true
clarissa
perry
might
jest
as
well
have
stayed
with
the
twins
as
not
for
her
niece
that
spoke
a
piece
forgot
half
of
it
an
clarissa
was
in
a
cold
sweat
every
minute
then
the
niece
had
a
fit
o
cryin
she
was
so
ashamed
at
failin
an
clarissa
had
to
take
her
home
so
they
both
missed
the
tree
an
letty
might
been
here
as
well
as
not
an
got
her
handkerchief
an
her
card
i
sent
john
trimble
to
him
by
the
doctor
but
he
did
take
no
notice
isaac
said
for
the
doctor
was
liftin
off
the
hot
an
turpentine
on
the
spot
where
i
had
my
anyway
if
john
had
to
have
the
colic

could
chosen
a
better
time

if

over
it

be
real
glad

had
it
for
nobody

never
will
be
sech
a
lively
an
amusin

evenin
in
the
orthodox
church

x
bless
the
card
sighed
david
thankfully
as
he
sat
down
to
smoke
a
pipe
and
propped
his
feet
contentedly
against
the
little
hessian
soldiers
the
blaze
of
the
logs
on
his
own
family
after
many
months
of
steam
heaters
in
the
hall
bedrooms
of
cheap
hotels
how
it
soothed
his
tired
heart
and
gave
it
visions
of
happiness
to
come
the
card
was
on
his
knee
where
he
could
look
from
its
pictured
scene
to
the
real
one
of
which
he
was
again
a
glad
and
grateful
part
bless
the
card
whispered
letty
boynton
to
herself
as
she
went
to
her
moonlit
bedroom
her
eyes
searched
the
snowy
landscape
and
found
the
parsonage
over
the
hills
and
far
away
then
her
heart
flew
like
a
bird
across
the
distance
and
beat
its
wings
in
gladness
for
a
faint
light
streamed
from
the
parson
study
windows
and
she
knew
that
father
and
son
were
together
that
in
itself
was
enough
with
david
sleeping
under
the
home
roof
but
was
coming
and
might
be
hers
her
very
own
bless
the
card
said
reba
larrabee
the
tears
shining
in
her
eyes
as
she
left
the
minister
alone
with
his
son
bless
everybody
and
everything
above
all
bless
god
whom
all
blessings
flow
bless
the
card
said
dick
larrabee
when
he
went
up
the
narrow
parsonage
stairs
to
the
room
of
his
boyhood
and
found
everything
as
it
had
been
years
ago
he
leaned
the
little
piece
of
paper
magic
against
the
mantel
clock
threw
it
a
kiss
and
then
opening
his
he
went
nearer
to
the
lamp
and
took
out
the
faded
tintype
of
a
girl
in
a
brown
cape
bless
the
card
he
said
again
with
a
new
note
in
his
voice
bless
the
girl
and
bless
if
it
brings
me
what
i
want
most
in
all
