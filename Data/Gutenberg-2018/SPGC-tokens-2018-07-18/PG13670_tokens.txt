is

irresistible

while
in

he
is

because
he
knew
well
the

and
because
irish
who
also
knew
it
well
refused
pointblank
to
go
into
it
again
even
as
a
rep
rode
alone
except
for
his
horses
down
into
the
range
of
the
rocking
general
roundup
was
about
to
start
down
that
way
and
there
was
stock
bought
by
the
flying
u
which
ranged
north
of
the
bear
paws
it
so
happened
that
the
owner
of
the
rocking
r
was
entertaining
a
party
of
friends
at
the
ranch
it
also
happened
that
the
friends
were
quite
new
to
the
west
and
its
ways
and
they
were
intensely
interested
in
all
pertaining
thereto
pink
gathered
that
much
from
the
crew
besides
observing
much
for
himself
hence
what
follows
after
sherwood
branciforte
was
down
in
the
blacksmith
shop
at
the
rocking
r
watching
one
andy
green
hammer
a
straight
andy
was
what
he
himself
called
a
tamer
of
wild
ones
and
he
was
hard
upon
his
riding
gear
sherwood
had
that
morning
watched
with
much
admiration
the
bending
of
that
same
and
his
respect
for
andy
was
beautiful
to
behold
lord
but
this
is
a
big
wild
country
he
was
saying
enthusiastically
and
the
people
in
it
are
big
and
wild
supplied
andy
yes
you
just
about
got
us
sized
up
correct
he
went
on
hammering
and
humming
under
his
breath
and
thinking
that
while
admiration
is
all
right
in
its
time
and
place
it
is
sometimes
a
bit
wearisome
oh
but
i
did
mean
that
the
young
man
protested
what
i
meant
was
breezy
and
picturesque
things
can
happen
out
here
life
and
men
do
run
in
grooves
no
nor
horses
assented
andy
leastways
not
in
oiled
ones
he
was
remembering
how
that
had
become
bent
you
did
some
magnificent
riding
this
morning
by
jove
i
never
seen
anything
like
it
strange
that
one
can
come
out
here
into
a
part
of
the
country
absolutely
new
and
raw
and
see
things
oh
it
ai
so
raw
as
you
might
think
andy
defended
jealously
nor
yet
new
of
course
it
is
new
a
commonwealth
in
the
making
you
ca
he
asserted
triumphantly
point
to
anything
that
existed
a
hundred
years
ago
scarcely
fifty
either
your
civilization
is
yet
in
the
cradle
a
lusty
infant
and
a
er
vociferous
one
but
still
an
infant
in
swaddling
clothes
sherwood
branciforte
had
given
lectures
before
the
of
his
home
town
and
young
ladies
had
spoken
of
him
as
gifted
and
he
had
come
to
hear
of
it
and
to
believe
andy
green
squinted
at
the
shank
before
he
made
reply
andy
also
was
gifted
in
his
modest
western
way
a
country
that
can
now
and
then
show
the
papers
for
a
civilization
old
as
the
phenixes
of
egypt
he
said
in
a
drawling
tone
that
was
absolutely
convincing
ai
what
i
call
raw
he
decided
that
a
little
more
hammering
right
next
the
rowel
was
necessary
and
bent
over
the
anvil
solicitously
even
the
of
sherwood
branciforte
could
not
fail
to
note
his
utter
indifference
to
the
presence
and
opinions
of
his
companion
branciforte
was
accustomed
to
disputation
at
times
even
to
enmity
but
not
to
indifference
he
blinked
my
dear
fellow
do
you
realize
what
it
is
that
statement
might
seem
to
imply
he
queried
haughtily
andy
being
a
cowpuncher
of
the
brand
known
as
a
real
objected
strongly
both
to
the
term
and
the
tone
he
stood
up
and
stared
down
at
the
other
disapprovingly
i
do
as
a
general
thing
find
myself
guilty
of
talking
in
my
sleep
he
retorted
and
i
prepared
to
let
anything
i
say
stand
till
the
next
throw
we
may
be
some
vociferous
out
here
twixt
the
mississippi
and
the
rockies
but
we
ai
no
mister
we
had
civilization
here
when
the
pilgrim
fathers
rock
was
nothing
but
a
pebble
to
let
fly
at
the
birds
indeed
fleered
sherwood
branciforte
in
a
voice
which
gave
much
intangible
insult
to
one
intelligence
andy
clicked
his
teeth
together
which
was
a
symptom
it
were
well
for
the
other
to
recognize
but
did
not
then
andy
smiled
which
was
another
symptom
he
fingered
the
spur
absently
laid
it
down
and
reached
with
the
gesture
that
betrays
the
act
as
having
become
second
nature
for
his
papers
and
tobacco
sack
uh
course
you
mean
all
right
and
you
ai
none
to
blame
for
what
you
do
know
but
you
talking
wild
and
scattering
when
you
stand
up
and
tell
me
i
ca
point
to
nothing
that
fifty
years
old
or
a
hundred
you
make
me
feel
sorry
for
yuh
i
can
take
you
to
something
or
i
seen
something
that
older
than
swearing
and
i
reckon
that
art
goes
back
to
when
men
wore
their
hair
long
and
a
was
called
ample
for
dress
occasions
are
you
crazy
man
sherwood
branciforte
exclaimed
incredulously
not
what
you
can
notice
you
wait
whilst
i
explain
once
last
fall
i
was
riding
by
my
high
lonesome
away
down
next
the
river
when
my
horse
went
lame
on
me
from
slipping
on
a
shale
bank
and
i
was
set
afoot
uh
course
you
being
plumb
ignorant
of
our
picturesque
life
you
half
know
all
that
might
signify
to
this
last
in
open
imitation
of
branciforte
it
implies
that
i
was
in
one
hell
of
a
fix
to
put
it
elegant
i
was
sixty
miles
from
anywhere
and
them
sixty
half
the
time
standing
on
end
and
lapping
over
on
themselves
that
there
is
down
where
old
mama
nature
gave
full
swing
to
a
morbid
hankering
after
doing
things
unconventional
result
is
that
about
as
ungodly
a
mixture
of
nightmare
scenery
as
this
old
world
can
show
up
and
i
ambled
around
considerable
and
am
in
a
position
to
pass
judgment
so
there
i
was
and
i
was
in
no
mood
to
view
the
beauties
uh
nature
to
speak
of
for
instance
i
did
admire
the
clouds
sailing
around
promiscous
in
the
sky
nor
anything
like
that
i
was
high
and
dry
and
the
walking
was
about
as
poor
as
i
ever
seen
and
my
boots
was
and
rubbed
blisters
before
i
covered
a
mile
of
that
acrobatic
territory
i
wanted
water
and
i
wanted
it
bad
before
i
got
it
i
wanted
it
a
heap
worse
he
stopped
cupped
his
slim
fingers
around
a
and
branciforte
sat
closer
he
did
not
know
what
was
coming
but
the
manner
of
the
indifferent
narrator
was
compelling
he
almost
forgot
the
point
at
issue
in
the
adventure
along
about
dark
i
camped
for
the
night
under
a
big
cliff
that
was
about
as
homelike
and
inviting
as
a
charitable
institution
and
made
a
bluff
at
sleeping
and
cussed
my
bum
luck
in
a
way
that
was
any
bluff
at
i
rose
and
mooched
on
his
cigarette
needed
another
match
and
he
searched
his
pockets
for
one
what
about
the
whatever
it
was
you
started
to
tell
me
urged
branciforte
grown
impatient
andy
looked
him
over
calmly
you
lived
in
ignorance
for
about
thirty
years
or
so
giving
a
rough
guess
at
your
age
i
reckon
you
can
stand
another
five
minutes
as
i
was
saying
i
wandered
around
like
a
dogy
when
it
first
turned
loose
on
the
range
and
is
trying
to
find
the
old
familiar
and
the
bucket
and
like
the
dogy
i
did
run
across
anything
that
looked
natural
or
inviting
all
that
day
i
perambulated
over
them
hills
and
i
will
say
i
enjoying
the
stroll
none
you
right
when
you
say
things
can
happen
out
here
there
some
things
it
just
as
well
they
do
happen
too
frequent
and
getting
lost
and
afoot
in
the
is
one
that
afternoon
i
dragged
myself
up
to
the
edge
of
a
deep
coulee
and
looked
over
to
see
if
there
was
any
way
of
getting
down
there
was
a
bright
green
streak
down
there
that
could
mean
nothing
but
water
at
that
time
of
year
this
was
last
fall
and
over
beyond
i
could
see
the
river
that
i
went
and
lost
i
looked
and
looked
but
the
walls
looked
straight
as
a
boston
man
pedigree
and
then
the
sun
come
out
from
behind
a
cloud
and
lit
up
a
spot
that
made
me
forget
for
a
minute
that
i
was
thirsty
as
a
dog
and
near
starved
besides
i
was
looking
down
on
the
ruins
and
yet
it
was
near
perfect
of
an
old
castle
every
stone
stood
out
that
clear
and
distinct
i
could
have
counted
there
was
a
tower
at
one
end
partly
fell
to
pieces
but
yet
enough
left
to
easy
tell
what
it
was
i
could
see
it
had
kinda
in
it
there
was
an
open
place
where
i
took
it
the
main
entrance
had
used
to
be
what
i
call
the
official
entrance
but
there
was
other
entrances
besides
and
some
of
was
made
by
time
and
hard
weather
there
was
what
looked
like
a
ditch
thing
yuh
mind
running
around
my
side
of
it
and
a
bridge
business
uh
course
it
was
all
needing
repairs
bad
and
part
of
it
yuh
needed
to
use
your
imagination
on
i
laid
there
for
quite
a
spell
looking
it
over
and
wondering
how
the
dickens
it
come
to
be
way
down
there
it
did
look
to
me
like
it
ought
to
be
there
at
all
but
in
a
school
geography
or
a
history
where
the
chapter
is
on
historic
and
prehistoric
hangouts
uh
the
heathen
the
deuce
a
castle
in
the
ejaculated
branciforte
that
what
it
was
all
right
i
found
a
trail
it
would
make
a
mountain
sheep
seasick
to
follow
and
i
got
down
into
the
coulee
it
was
lonesome
as
sin
and
spooky
but
there
was
a
spring
close
by
and
a
creek
running
from
it
and
what
is
a
treat
in
that
part
uh
the
country
it
was
good
drinking
and
did
have
neither
alkali
nor
sulphur
nor
mineral
in
it
it
was
just
straight
water
and
you
can
gamble
i
filled
up
on
it
then
i
shot
a
rabbit
or
two
that
was
hanging
out
around
the
ruins
and
camped
there
till
next
day
when
i
found
a
pass
out
and
got
my
bearings
by
the
river
and
come
on
into
camp
so
when
you
throw
slurs
on
our
plumb
newness
and
shininess
got
the
cards
to
call
yuh
that
castle
was
built
last
summer
mister
and
whoever
did
build
it
was
some
civilized
so
there
yuh
are
andy
took
a
last
lingering
pull
at
the
cigarette
stub
flung
it
into
the
backened
forge
and
picked
up
the
spur
he
settled
his
hat
on
his
head
at
its
accustomed
tilt
and
started
for
the
door
and
the
sunlight
oh
but
say
did
you
find
out
anything
about
it
afterwards
there
must
have
been
something
if
it
relics
uh
the
dim
and
musty
past
yuh
mean
there
was
relics
to
burn
i
kicked
up
specimens
of
ancient
dishes
and
truck
like
that
while
i
was
prowling
around
for
and
inside
the
castle
in
what
i
reckon
was
used
for
the
main
hall
i
run
acrost
a
skeleton
that
is
part
of
one
i
do
believe
it
was
all
there
though
but
man
alive
why
have
you
made
use
of
a
discovery
like
that
branciforte
followed
him
out
lighting
his
pipe
with
fingers
that
trembled
do
you
realize
what
a
thing
like
that
means
andy
turned
and
smiled
lazily
down
at
him
at
the
time
i
was
there
i
was
all
took
up
with
the
idea
uh
getting
home
i
could
eat
skeletons
mister
nor
yet
the
remains
uh
prehistoric
dishes
and
i
did
run
acrost
no
money
nor
no
plan
marked
up
with
crosses
where
you
supposed
to
do
your
excavating
for
treasure
it
was
nothing
that
i
could
see
for
a
man
to
starve
to
death
while
he
examined
it
thorough
and
so
far
as
i
know
there
ai
any
record
of
it
i
never
heard
no
one
mention
building
it
anyhow
he
stooped
and
adjusted
the
spur
to
his
heel
to
see
if
it
were
quite
right
and
went
off
to
the
stable
humming
under
his
breath
branciforte
stood
at
the
door
of
the
blacksmith
shop
and
gazed
after
him
puffing
meditatively
at
his
pipe
lord
the
ignorance
of
these
western
folk
to
run
upon
a
find
like
that
and
to
think
it
less
important
than
getting
home
in
time
for
supper
to
let
a
discovery
like
that
lie
forgotten
a
mere
incident
in
a
day
travel
that
fellow
thinks
more
right
now
about
his
horse
going
lame
and
himself
raising
blisters
on
his
heels
than
of
jove
what
ignorance
he
he
could
the
skeleton
or
the
dishes
jerusalem
branciforte
knocked
his
pipe
gently
against
the
put
in
into
his
coat
pocket
and
hurried
to
the
house
to
hunt
up
the
others
and
tell
them
what
he
had
heard
that
night
the
roundup
pulled
in
to
the
home
ranch
the
visitors
headed
by
their
host
swooped
down
upon
the
roundup
wagons
just
when
the
boys
were
gathered
together
for
a
cigarette
or
two
apiece
and
a
little
talk
before
rolling
in
there
was
no
to
do
and
trouble
winged
afar
sherwood
branciforte
hunted
out
andy
green
where
he
lay
at
ease
with
head
and
shoulders
propped
against
a
wheel
of
the
and
gossipped
with
pink
and
a
few
others
look
here
green
he
said
in
a
voice
to
arrest
the
attention
of
the
whole
camp
i
wish
you
tell
the
others
that
tale
you
told
me
this
afternoon
about
that
ruined
castle
down
in
the
hills
mason
here
is
a
newspaper
man
he
scents
a
story
for
his
paper
and
the
rest
refuse
to
believe
a
word
i
say
i
hate
to
have
a
rep
like
that
branciforte
andy
said
commiseratingly
and
turned
his
big
honest
gray
eyes
to
where
stood
the
women
two
breezy
young
persons
with
sleeves
rolled
to
tanned
elbows
and
cowboy
hats
of
the
musical
comedy
brand
also
they
had
gay
silk
handkerchiefs
knotted
picturesquely
around
their
throats
there
was
another
a
giggly
gurgly
lady
with
gray
hair
fluffed
up
into
a
pompadour
you
know
the
sort
she
was
the
kind
who
refuses
to
grow
old
and
so
merely
grows
imbecile
do
tell
us
green
this
young
old
lady
urged
displaying
much
gold
by
her
smile
it
sounds
so
romantic
it
funny
you
never
mentioned
it
to
any
of
us
put
in
the
old
man
suspiciously
andy
pulled
himself
up
into
a
more
decorous
position
and
turned
his
eyes
towards
his
boss
i
never
knew
yuh
took
any
interest
in
he
explained
mildly
sherwood
says
you
found
a
said
the
young
old
lady
shuddering
pleasurably
yes
i
did
find
one
or
part
of
one
andy
admitted
reluctantly
what
were
the
relics
of
pottery
like
demanded
one
of
the
girls
as
if
she
meant
to
test
him
i
do
some
collecting
of
that
sort
of
thing
andy
threw
away
his
cigarette
and
with
it
all
compunction
well
i
was
so
much
interested
in
the
dishes
as
in
getting
something
to
eat
he
apologized
i
saw
several
different
kinds
one
was
a
big
awkward
looking
thing
and
was
pretty
heavy
and
had
straight
sides
then
i
come
across
one
or
two
more
that
was
ornamented
some
one
had
what
looked
like
a
fish
on
it
and
the
other
i
could
make
out
very
well
they
did
look
to
be
worth
much
none
of
green
said
his
employer
steadily
there
such
a
place
andy
returned
his
look
honestly
there
was
and
there
is
yet
i
guess
he
asserted
i
tell
you
how
you
can
find
it
and
what
like
if
yuh
doubt
my
words
he
glanced
around
and
found
every
man
including
the
cook
listening
intently
he
picked
a
blade
of
new
grass
and
began
splitting
it
into
tiny
threads
the
host
found
boxes
for
the
women
to
sit
upon
and
the
men
sat
down
upon
the
grass
before
i
come
here
to
work
i
was
riding
for
the
circle
one
day
i
was
riding
away
down
in
the
alone
and
my
horse
slipped
in
some
shale
rock
and
went
lame
strained
his
shoulder
so
i
ride
him
that
put
me
afoot
and
climbing
up
and
down
them
hills
i
lost
my
bearings
and
did
know
where
i
was
at
for
a
day
or
two
i
wandered
around
aimless
and
got
into
a
strip
uh
country
that
was
new
to
me
and
plumb
lonesome
and
wild
that
second
day
is
when
i
happened
across
this
ruin
i
was
looking
down
into
a
deep
coulee
hunting
water
when
the
sun
come
out
and
shone
straight
on
to
this
place
it
was
right
down
under
me
a
stone
ruin
with
a
tower
on
one
end
and
kinda
tumbled
down
so
it
was
so
awful
high
the
tower
was
there
was
a
a
moat
branciforte
suggested
that
the
word
a
moat
around
it
and
a
bridge
that
was
just
about
gone
to
pieces
it
had
loopholes
like
the
pictures
of
castles
and
a
battlement
ventured
one
of
the
cowgirls
andy
had
not
meant
to
say
battlement
of
a
truth
his
conception
of
battlements
was
extremely
hazy
but
he
caught
up
the
word
and
warmed
to
the
subject
battlement
well
i
should
guess
yes
there
was
about
as
elegant
a
battlement
as
i
want
to
see
anywhere
it
was
sure
a
peach
it
was
he
hesitated
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
it
was
high
as
the
tower
and
it
had
figures
carved
all
over
it
them
kind
that
looks
like
in
school
with
bows
and
arrows
stuck
out
in
front
of
threatening
not
the
old
greek
exclaimed
one
of
the
girls
in
a
little
breathless
voice
i
could
say
as
to
that
andy
made
guarded
reply
i
never
made
no
special
study
of
them
things
but
they
was
sure
old
and
about
how
large
was
the
castle
put
in
the
man
who
wrote
things
how
many
rooms
say
i
hate
to
give
a
guess
at
the
size
i
did
step
it
off
and
i
a
punk
guesser
the
rooms
i
did
count
i
only
explored
around
in
the
main
hall
like
a
little
but
it
got
dark
early
down
in
there
and
i
did
have
no
matches
to
waste
and
next
morning
i
started
right
out
at
to
find
the
way
home
no
i
never
counted
the
rooms
and
if
i
had
the
chances
are
i
have
likely
counted
the
same
one
once
to
count
them
rooms
would
take
an
expert
which
i
ai
not
at
counting
i
do
reckon
though
that
there
was
so
awful
many
anyway
not
more
than
fifteen
or
twenty
but
as
i
say
i
rightly
make
a
guess
even
or
i
hate
to
ruins
do
interest
me
much
though
i
was
kinda
surprised
to
run
acrost
that
one
all
right
and
i
willing
to
gamble
there
was
warm
and
exciting
times
down
there
when
the
place
was
in
running
order
i
kinda
like
to
have
been
down
there
then
last
fall
though
there
was
nothing
to
get
excited
over
except
getting
out
uh
there
a
castle
away
out
here
just
think
good
people
what
that
means
romance
adventure
and
scientific
discoveries
we
must
go
right
down
there
and
explore
the
place
why
ca
we
start
at
once
in
the
morning
this
gentleman
can
guide
us
to
the
place
and
it
ai
easy
going
andy
remarked
conscientiously
it
pretty
rough
some
places
you
have
to
walk
and
lead
your
horses
they
swept
aside
the
discouragement
we
need
pick
and
shovels
and
men
to
dig
cried
one
enthusiast
uncle
peter
can
lend
us
some
of
his
men
there
may
be
treasure
to
unearth
there
may
be
that
is
wonderful
and
mysterious
get
busy
uncle
peter
and
get
your
outfit
together
you
boasted
that
a
roundup
can
beat
the
army
in
getting
under
way
quickly
now
let
us
have
a
practical
demonstration
we
want
to
start
by
six
all
of
us
with
a
cook
and
four
or
five
men
to
do
the
excavating
bring
it
to
pass
it
was
the
voice
of
the
girl
whom
her
friends
spoke
of
as
the
life
of
the
party
the
voice
of
it
miles
from
here
good
and
strong
and
mostly
up
and
down
put
in
andy
the
raven
mocked
we
are
prepared
to
face
the
do
we
start
at
six
uncle
peter
uncle
peter
glanced
sideways
at
the
roundup
boss
to
bring
it
to
pass
he
would
be
obliged
to
impress
the
roundup
cook
and
part
of
the
crew
it
was
breaking
an
unwritten
law
of
the
rangeland
and
worse
it
was
doing
something
and
foolish
but
not
even
the
owner
of
the
rocking
r
may
withstand
the
pleading
of
a
pretty
woman
uncle
peter
squirmed
but
he
promised
we
start
at
six
earlier
if
you
say
so
the
roundup
boss
gave
his
employer
a
look
of
disgust
and
walked
away
the
crew
took
it
that
he
went
off
to
some
secluded
place
to
swear
thereafter
there
was
much
discussion
of
ways
and
means
and
much
enthusiasm
among
the
visitors
from
the
east
equalled
by
the
depression
of
the
crew
for
cowboys
do
not
as
a
rule
take
kindly
to
pick
and
shovel
and
the
excavators
had
not
yet
been
chosen
from
among
them
they
were
uneasy
and
they
stole
frequent
betraying
glances
at
one
another
all
of
which
amused
pink
much
pink
would
like
to
have
gone
along
and
would
certainly
have
offered
his
services
but
for
the
fact
that
his
work
there
was
done
and
he
would
have
to
start
back
to
the
flying
u
just
as
soon
as
one
of
his
best
saddle
horses
which
had
stepped
on
a
broken
beer
bottle
and
cut
its
foot
was
able
to
travel
that
would
be
in
a
few
days
probably
so
pink
sighed
and
watched
the
preparations
enviously
since
he
was
fairly
committed
into
breaking
all
precedents
uncle
peter
plunged
recklessly
he
ordered
the
to
be
restocked
and
prepared
for
the
trip
and
he
took
the
and
half
the
crew
the
foreman
he
wisely
left
behind
with
the
remnant
of
his
outfit
they
were
all
to
eat
at
the
house
while
the
was
away
and
they
were
to
spread
their
soogans
which
is
to
say
beds
where
they
might
if
the
proved
too
small
or
too
hot
the
foreman
outraged
beyond
words
saddled
at
daybreak
and
rode
to
the
nearest
town
and
the
unchosen
half
turned
out
in
a
body
to
watch
the
departure
of
the
explorers
which
speaks
eloquently
of
their
interest
for
cowboys
off
duty
are
prone
to
sleep
long
andy
as
guide
bolted
ahead
of
the
party
that
he
might
open
the
gate
bolted
is
a
good
word
for
his
horse
swerved
and
kept
on
running
swerved
again
and
came
down
in
a
heap
andy
did
not
get
up
and
the
women
screamed
then
pink
and
some
others
hurried
out
and
bore
andy
groaning
to
the
the
visitors
from
the
east
gathered
perturbed
around
the
door
sympathetic
and
dismayed
it
looked
very
much
as
if
their
exploration
must
end
where
it
began
and
looked
about
to
weep
until
andy
still
groaning
sent
pink
out
to
comfort
them
he
says
you
need
give
up
the
trip
on
his
account
pink
announced
musically
from
the
doorway
he
drawing
a
map
and
marking
the
coulee
where
the
ruin
is
he
says
most
any
of
the
boys
that
know
the
country
at
all
can
find
the
place
for
yuh
and
he
is
hurt
permanent
he
strained
his
back
so
he
ca
ride
is
all
pink
dimpled
at
the
young
old
lady
who
was
admiring
him
frankly
and
withdrew
inside
andy
green
was
making
pencil
marks
and
giving
the
chosen
half
explicit
directions
at
last
he
folded
the
paper
and
handed
it
to
one
called
sandy
that
the
best
i
can
do
for
yuh
he
finished
i
do
see
how
yuh
can
miss
it
if
yuh
follow
that
map
close
and
if
them
gay
females
make
any
kick
on
the
trail
you
just
remind
that
i
said
all
along
it
was
rough
going
so
long
and
good
luck
so
with
feminine
laughter
and
much
dust
passed
the
exploring
party
from
the
rocking
say
pink
began
two
days
later
to
andy
who
was
sitting
on
the
shady
side
of
the
staring
absently
at
the
skyline
there
a
word
uh
praise
i
been
aiming
to
give
yuh
i
seen
riding
and
i
done
a
trifle
in
that
line
myself
and
learned
some
uh
the
tricks
but
i
want
to
say
i
never
did
see
a
man
flop
his
horse
any
neater
than
you
done
that
morning
i
bet
there
ai
another
man
in
the
outfit
got
next
your
play
i
could
uh
done
it
better
myself
where
did
you
learn
that
ever
ride
in
wyoming
andy
turned
his
eyes
but
not
his
head
which
was
a
way
he
had
and
regarded
pink
slantwise
for
at
least
ten
seconds
yes
i
rode
in
wyoming
he
answered
quietly
then
what
the
chance
for
a
job
up
your
way
is
the
flying
u
open
for
good
men
and
true
it
wo
cost
yuh
a
cent
to
try
pink
told
him
how
your
back
think
you
be
able
to
ride
by
the
time
skeeker
is
able
to
travel
andy
grinned
say
he
confided
suddenly
if
that
hoss
improve
some
speedy
i
be
riding
on
ahead
i
reckon
i
be
able
to
travel
before
them
explorers
get
back
my
friend
why
dimpled
pink
boldly
why
well
the
going
is
some
rough
down
that
way
if
they
get
them
wagons
half
way
to
the
coulee
marked
with
a
cross
they
sure
have
to
attach
wings
onto
i
been
some
worried
about
that
i
much
believe
uncle
peter
is
going
to
enjoy
that
trip
and
he
sure
does
get
irritable
by
spells
i
got
a
notion
to
ride
for
some
other
outfit
this
summer
was
that
the
reason
you
throwed
your
horse
down
and
got
hurt
that
morning
questioned
pink
and
andy
grinned
again
by
way
of
reply
they
be
gone
a
week
best
they
can
do
he
estimated
aloud
we
ought
to
be
able
to
make
our
getaway
by
then
easy
pink
assured
him
that
a
week
would
see
them
headed
for
the
flying
u
it
was
the
evening
of
the
sixth
day
and
the
two
were
packed
and
ready
to
leave
in
the
morning
when
andy
broke
off
humming
and
gave
a
snort
of
dismay
by
gracious
there
they
come
my
mother
lives
in
buffalo
pink
in
a
little
drab
house
with
white
trimmings
write
and
tell
her
how
her
son
oh
beloved
but
they
hitting
her
up
lively
if
they
made
the
whole
trip
in
that
there
frame
uh
mind
they
could
uh
gone
clean
to
miles
city
and
back
how
pretty
the
birds
sing
pink
hear
words
directly
directly
pink
did
you
the
biggest
liar
on
earth
sherwood
branciforte
contributed
to
the
recriminating
wave
that
near
engulfed
andy
green
you
sent
us
down
there
on
a
chase
you
brute
you
i
never
sent
nobody
andy
defended
you
was
all
crazy
to
go
and
nothing
but
an
old
stone
hut
some
trapper
had
built
came
an
indignant
female
tone
there
never
was
any
castle
nor
a
man
home
is
his
castle
argued
andy
standing
unabashed
before
them
putting
it
that
way
it
was
a
castle
all
right
there
was
babel
out
of
which
and
the
skeleton
oh
you
it
was
a
dead
this
from
the
young
old
lady
who
was
looking
very
draggled
and
not
at
all
young
i
do
call
to
mind
ever
saying
it
was
human
put
in
andy
looking
at
her
with
surprised
gray
eyes
and
the
battlements
groaned
you
wanted
battlements
andy
flung
mildly
into
the
uproar
i
always
aim
to
please
with
that
he
edged
away
from
them
and
made
his
escape
to
where
the
cook
was
profanely
mixing
biscuits
for
supper
moves
put
an
edge
to
his
temper
the
cook
growled
an
epithet
and
andy
passed
on
down
near
the
stable
he
met
one
of
the
chosen
half
and
the
fellow
greeted
him
with
a
grin
andy
stopped
abruptly
say
they
do
seem
none
too
agreeable
he
began
tentatively
jerking
his
thumb
toward
the
buzzing
group
how
about
it
sandy
was
they
that
petulant
all
the
way
sandy
the
chuckled
it
lucky
you
got
hurt
at
the
last
minute
and
yet
it
was
worth
the
trip
uh
course
we
got
stalled
with
the
wagons
the
second
day
out
but
them
women
was
sure
ambitious
and
made
us
go
on
with
a
packadero
layout
i
will
say
that
going
down
they
stood
the
hardships
remarkable
it
was
coming
back
that
frazzled
the
party
and
when
we
found
the
place
say
but
it
was
lucky
you
was
along
they
sure
went
when
they
seen
the
ruins
the
old
party
with
the
pompadoor
displayed
temper
and
shed
tears
uh
rage
when
she
looked
into
the
cabin
and
seen
the
remains
uh
that
there
was
language
it
was
polite
to
overhear
she
said
a
lot
uh
things
about
you
andy
one
thing
they
could
seem
to
get
over
and
that
was
the
smallness
uh
the
blamed
shack
them
fourteen
or
fifteen
rooms
laid
heavy
on
their
minds
i
did
say
there
was
fourteen
or
fifteen
rooms
i
said
i
count
the
rooms
i
did
either
i
never
heard
of
anybody
counting
one
room
did
you
pink
no
pink
agreed
i
never
did
sandy
became
suddenly
convulsed
oh
but
the
funniest
thing
was
the
ancient
pottery
he
gasped
the
tears
standing
in
his
eyes
that
old
dutch
oven
was
bad
enough
but
when
one
uh
the
girls
that
one
that
collects
old
dishes
happened
across
an
old
mackerel
can
and
picked
it
up
and
saw
the
fish
on
the
label
she
was
the
maddest
female
person
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
barring
none
if
you
been
in
reach
about
that
time
she
just
about
clawed
your
eyes
out
andy
green
oh
me
oh
my
sandy
slapped
his
thigh
and
had
another
spasm
sounds
indicated
that
the
wave
of
recrimination
was
rolling
nearer
andy
turned
to
find
himself
within
arm
length
of
uncle
pete
maybe
this
is
your
idea
of
a
practical
joke
green
he
said
to
andy
but
anyway
it
will
cost
you
your
job
i
ought
to
charge
you
up
with
the
time
my
outfit
has
spent
gallivanting
around
the
country
on
the
strength
of
your
wild
yarn
the
quicker
you
hit
the
trail
the
better
it
will
suit
me
by
the
way
what
your
first
name
he
asked
pulling
out
a
andy
answered
the
unrepentant
one
andy
uncle
peter
paused
with
a
fountain
pen
between
his
fingers
he
looked
andy
up
and
down
and
the
frown
left
his
face
he
proceeded
to
write
out
the
check
and
when
it
was
done
he
handed
it
over
with
a
pleased
smile
what
did
you
do
it
for
green
he
queried
in
a
friendlier
tone
andy
told
him
laconically
and
turned
away
half
an
hour
later
andy
and
pink
trailed
out
of
the
coulee
that
sheltered
the
rocking
when
they
were
out
and
away
from
the
fence
and
pink
horses
knowing
instinctively
that
they
were
homeward
bound
were
jogging
straight
west
without
need
of
guidance
andy
felt
in
his
pocket
for
cigarette
material
his
fingers
came
in
contact
with
the
check
uncle
peter
had
given
him
and
he
drew
it
forth
and
looked
it
over
again
well
by
gracious
he
said
to
himself
uncle
peter
thinks
even
i
guess
he
handed
the
check
to
pink
and
rolled
his
cigarette
and
pink
after
one
comprehending
look
at
the
slip
of
paper
doubled
up
over
his
and
shouted
with
glee
for
the
check
was
written
pay
to
the
order
of
ananias
green
and
i
got
to
sign
myself
a
liar
or
i
do
collect
no
money
sighed
andy
that
what
i
call
tough
luck
by
gracious
blink
the
was
at
its
unpicturesque
worst
for
two
days
the
wind
had
raged
and
ranted
over
the
hilltops
and
whooped
up
the
long
coulees
so
that
tears
stood
in
the
eyes
of
the
happy
family
when
they
faced
it
impersonal
tears
blown
into
being
by
the
very
force
of
the
wind
also
when
they
faced
it
they
rode
with
bodies
aslant
over
their
and
hats
pulled
low
over
their
streaming
eyes
and
with
coats
fastened
jealously
close
if
there
were
buttons
enough
well
and
good
if
not
a
strap
cinched
tightly
about
the
middle
was
considered
pretty
lucky
and
not
to
be
despised
though
it
was
early
september
coats
were
much
in
evidence
for
the
wind
had
a
chill
way
of
searching
to
the
very
marrow
and
even
a
good
was
not
always
protection
sufficient
when
the
third
day
dawned
bleakly
literally
blown
piecemeal
from
out
darkness
as
bleak
the
happy
family
rose
shiveringly
and
with
sombre
disapproval
of
whatever
met
their
eyes
dressed
hurriedly
in
the
chill
of
flapping
tent
and
went
out
to
stagger
drunkenly
over
to
where
patsy
in
the
was
trying
vainly
to
keep
the
biscuits
from
becoming
and
sundry
pans
and
tins
from
taking
jingling
little
excursions
on
their
own
account
over
the
brow
of
the
next
ridge
straggled
the
cavvy
tails
and
manes
whipping
in
the
gale
the
nighthawk
swearing
so
that
his
voice
came
booming
down
to
camp
truly
the
day
opened
inauspiciously
enough
for
almost
any
dire
ending
as
further
evidence
saddling
horses
for
circle
resolved
itself
as
weary
remarked
at
the
top
of
his
voice
to
pink
at
his
elbow
into
a
broncho
busting
tournament
for
horses
have
nerves
and
nothing
so
rasps
the
nerves
of
man
or
beast
as
a
wind
that
never
stops
blowing
which
means
swaying
ropes
and
popping
saddle
leather
and
flapping
like
wet
sheets
on
a
clothes
line
horses
do
not
like
these
things
and
they
are
prone
to
eloquent
manifestations
of
their
disapproval
over
by
the
a
man
they
called
blink
for
want
of
a
better
name
was
fighting
his
big
sorrel
silently
with
that
dogged
determination
which
may
easily
grow
malevolent
the
sorrel
was
at
best
a
nervous
beast
and
what
with
the
wind
and
the
flapping
of
everything
in
sight
and
the
pitching
of
horses
around
him
he
was
nearly
crazed
with
fear
in
the
abstract
blink
was
trying
to
bridle
him
and
he
was
not
saying
a
word
which
in
the
general
uproar
was
strange
but
blink
seldom
did
say
anything
he
was
one
of
the
aliens
who
had
drifted
into
the
flying
u
outfit
that
spring
looking
for
work
chip
had
taken
him
on
and
he
had
stayed
he
could
ride
anything
in
his
string
and
he
was
always
just
where
he
was
wanted
he
never
went
to
town
when
the
others
clattered
off
for
a
few
hours
celebration
more
or
less
mild
he
never
took
part
in
any
of
the
camp
fun
and
he
never
offended
any
man
if
any
offended
him
they
did
not
know
it
unless
they
were
observant
if
they
were
they
would
see
his
pale
lashes
wink
fast
for
a
minute
and
they
might
read
aright
the
sign
and
refrain
from
further
banter
so
blink
though
he
was
counted
a
good
man
on
roundup
was
left
pretty
much
alone
when
in
camp
andy
green
well
and
none
too
favorably
known
down
rocking
r
way
and
lately
adopted
into
the
happy
family
on
the
recommendation
of
pink
and
his
own
pleasing
personality
looped
the
latigo
into
the
holder
gave
his
own
dancing
steed
a
slap
of
the
variety
and
went
over
to
help
out
blink
blink
eyed
his
approach
with
much
the
same
expression
with
which
he
eyed
the
horse
i
never
hollered
for
assistance
he
remarked
grudgingly
when
andy
was
at
his
elbow
when
i
ca
handle
any
of
the
skates
in
my
string
i
quit
riding
and
take
to
whereupon
he
turned
his
back
as
squarely
as
he
might
upon
andy
and
made
another
stealthy
grab
for
the
sorrel
ears
there
is
such
a
thing
in
the
as
jealousy
among
riders
and
the
fame
of
andy
green
had
gone
afar
all
right
just
as
you
say
and
not
as
i
care
a
darn
andy
retorted
and
went
back
to
where
his
own
mount
stood
tail
to
the
wind
he
did
not
in
the
least
mind
the
rebuff
he
really
felt
all
the
indifference
his
manner
portrayed
perhaps
even
more
he
had
offered
help
where
help
was
needed
and
that
ended
it
for
him
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
blink
might
feel
jealous
over
andy
reputation
as
a
tamer
of
wild
ones
or
mistake
his
good
nature
for
patronage
five
minutes
later
when
chip
looked
around
comprehensively
at
the
lot
of
them
in
various
degrees
of
readiness
saw
that
blink
was
still
fighting
silently
for
mastery
of
the
sorrel
and
told
andy
to
go
over
and
help
him
get
saddled
andy
said
nothing
of
having
had
his
services
refused
but
went
this
time
blink
also
said
nothing
but
accepted
in
ungracious
surrender
the
assistance
thus
thrust
upon
him
for
on
the
unless
one
is
in
a
mind
to
roll
his
bed
and
ride
away
one
does
not
question
when
the
leader
commands
andy
attitude
was
still
that
of
indifference
he
really
thought
very
little
about
blink
or
his
opinions
and
the
rapid
blinking
of
the
pale
lashes
was
quite
lost
upon
him
they
rode
eighteen
uncomfortable
cowboys
tumultuously
away
from
the
camp
where
canvas
bulged
and
swayed
and
loose
corners
cracked
like
pistol
shots
over
the
hill
where
even
the
short
prairie
grass
crouched
and
flattened
itself
against
the
sod
where
stray
pebbles
loosened
by
the
ungentle
tread
of
pitching
hoofs
skidded
twice
as
far
as
in
calm
weather
the
gray
sky
bent
threateningly
above
them
into
flying
scud
but
never
showing
a
hint
of
blue
later
there
might
be
rain
sleet
snow
or
sunshine
as
nature
might
whimsically
direct
but
for
the
present
she
seemed
content
with
only
the
chill
wind
that
blew
the
very
heart
out
of
a
man
whenever
chip
pulled
up
to
turn
off
a
couple
of
riders
that
they
might
search
a
bit
of
rough
country
his
voice
was
sharp
with
the
general
discomfort
when
men
rode
away
at
his
command
it
was
with
brows
drawn
together
and
vengeful
heels
digging
the
of
horses
in
quite
as
unlovely
a
mood
as
themselves
out
at
the
end
of
the
circle
chip
divided
the
remainder
of
his
men
into
two
groups
for
the
homeward
drive
one
group
he
himself
led
the
other
owned
weary
as
temporary
commander
and
galloped
off
to
the
left
skirting
close
to
the
foothills
of
the
bear
paws
in
that
group
rode
pink
and
happy
jack
slim
andy
green
and
blink
the
silent
i
betche
we
get
a
blizzard
out
uh
this
gloomed
happy
jack
pulling
his
coat
collar
up
another
fraction
of
an
inch
and
the
way
headed
us
we
got
to
cross
that
big
flat
going
back
in
the
thick
of
it
chances
is
we
git
lost
no
one
made
reply
to
this
it
seemed
scarcely
worth
while
every
man
of
them
rode
humped
away
from
the
wind
his
head
drawn
down
as
close
to
his
shoulders
as
might
be
conversation
under
those
conditions
was
not
likely
to
become
brisk
a
fellow
that
punch
cows
for
a
living
happy
jack
asserted
venomously
after
a
minute
had
ought
to
be
shut
up
somewheres
he
sure
ai
responsible
i
betche
next
summer
do
see
me
at
it
aw
shut
up
we
know
you
without
you
blatting
it
by
the
hour
snapped
pink
showing
never
a
dimple
happy
jack
tugged
again
at
his
collar
and
made
remarks
to
which
no
one
paid
the
slightest
attention
they
rode
in
amongst
the
hills
and
narrow
ridges
dividing
draws
as
narrow
where
range
cattle
would
seek
shelter
from
the
cutting
blast
that
raked
the
open
then
just
as
they
began
to
realize
that
the
wind
was
not
quite
such
a
raging
torment
came
a
new
phase
of
nature
unpleasant
humor
it
was
not
a
blizzard
that
descended
upon
them
though
when
it
came
rolling
down
from
the
hilltops
it
much
resembled
one
the
wind
had
changed
and
brought
fog
cold
suffocating
impenetrable
yet
such
was
the
mood
of
them
that
no
one
said
anything
about
it
weary
had
been
about
to
turn
off
a
couple
of
men
but
did
not
what
was
the
use
since
they
could
not
see
twenty
yards
for
a
time
they
rode
aimlessly
weary
in
the
lead
then
when
it
grew
no
better
but
worse
he
pulled
up
just
where
a
high
bank
shut
off
the
wind
and
a
tangle
of
brush
barred
the
way
in
front
we
may
as
well
camp
right
here
till
things
loosen
up
a
little
he
said
there
no
use
playing
any
longer
we
have
some
fire
for
a
change
mama
this
is
sure
beautiful
weather
at
that
they
brightened
a
bit
and
hurriedly
dismounted
and
hunted
dry
wood
since
they
were
to
have
a
fire
the
general
tendency
was
to
have
a
big
one
so
that
when
they
squatted
before
it
and
held
out
cold
ungloved
fingers
to
the
warmth
the
flames
were
leaping
high
into
the
fog
and
crackling
right
cheerily
it
needed
only
a
few
puffs
at
their
cigarettes
to
chase
the
gloom
from
their
faces
and
put
them
in
the
mood
for
talk
only
blink
sat
apart
and
stared
moodily
into
the
fire
his
hands
clasped
listlessly
around
his
knees
and
to
him
they
gave
no
attention
he
was
an
alien
and
a
taciturn
one
at
that
the
happy
family
were
accustomed
to
living
clannishly
even
on
roundup
and
only
when
they
tacitly
adopted
a
man
as
they
had
adopted
pink
and
irish
and
last
but
not
least
important
andy
green
did
they
take
note
of
that
man
mood
and
demand
reasons
for
any
surliness
if
slim
would
perk
up
and
go
run
down
a
grouse
or
two
pink
observed
pointedly
we
be
all
right
for
the
day
how
about
it
slim
run
down
yourself
slim
retorted
by
golly
i
ai
no

jack
remarked
dolefully
go
on
happy
and
get

protested
happy
jack
happy
looks
like
he
was
out
for
a
rep
bantered
pink
he
makes
me
think
uh
the
bad
man
in
a
western
play
all
he
needs
is
his
hat
turned
up
in
front
and
his
sleeves
rolled
up
to
his
elbow
like
he
was
killing
hogs
happy
would
make
a
outlaw
with
that
gun
and
that
face
uh
his

by
golly
i

on
doing
he
going
to
punch

no
more

thinking
about
turning
out
well
when
i
do

happy
with
labored

yuh

walk
off
ten
paces
and
let
me
show
yuh
growled
happy
pink
made
as
if
to
rise
then
settled
back
with
a
sigh
ten
paces
is
farther
than
you
could
drive
me
from
this
fire
with
a
club
he
said
and
you
could
see
me
in
this
fog
say
it
pretty
solid
said
weary
looking
around
him
at
the
blank
gray
wall
a
fellow
could
sit
right
here
and
be
a
lot
ignorant
of
what
going
on
around
him
a
fellow
could
when
i
was
riding
down
in
the
san
simon
basin
spoke
up
andy
rolling
his
second
cigarette
daintily
between
his
i
had
a
kinda
queer
experience
in
a
fog
once
it
was
thick
as
this
one
and
it
rolled
down
just
about
as
sudden
and
unexpected
that
a
plenty
wild
patch
uh
country
or
it
was
when
i
was
there
i
was
riding
for
a
spanish
gent
that
kept
white
men
as
a
luxury
and
let
the
greasers
do
about
all
the
rough
work
such
as
killing
off
superfluous
neighbors
and
running
brands
artistic
and
the
like
oh
he
was
a
gay
mark
all
right
but
about
this
other
deal
i
was
out
riding
alone
after
a
little
bunch
uh
hosses
one
day
in
the
fall
i
packed
my
gun
and
a
pair
uh
field
glasses
and
every
time
i
rode
up
onto
a
mesa
i
take
a
long
look
at
all
the
lower
country
to
save
riding
it
i
guess
prognosticated
around
like
that
for
two
or
three
hours
when
i
come
out
on
a
little
pinnacle
that
slopes
down
gradual
toward
a
home
ranch
only
the
ranch
itself
was
quite
a
ride
back
up
the
basin
i
got
off
my
horse
and
set
down
on
a
rock
to
build
me
a
smoke
and
was
gazing
off
over
the
country
idle
when
i
seen
a
rider
come
up
out
of
a
little
draw
and
gallop
along
to
pass
my
pinnacle
on
the
left
you
know
how
a
man
out
alone
like
that
will
watch
anything
from
a
chicken
hawk
up
in
the
air
to
a
band
uh
sheep
without
any
interest
in
either
one
but
just
to
have
your
eyes
on
something
that
alive
and
moves
so
i
watched
him
idle
while
i
smoked
pretty
soon
i
seen
another
fellow
ride
out
into
sight
where
the
first
one
had
and
hit
her
up
lively
down
the
trail
i
did
do
no
wondering
i
just
sat
and
watched
both
for
want
uh
something
better
to
do
finding
them
strays
was
important
i
happy
jack
insinuated
it
could
wait
and
did
so
i
kept
an
eye
on
these
gazabos
and
pretty
soon
i
saw
the
hind
fellow
turn
off
the
trail
and
go
fogging
along
behind
a
little
rise
he
come
into
sight
again
whipping
down
both
sides
like
he
was
heading
a
wild
and
that
was
queer
because
the
only
other
live
thing
in
sight
was
man
number
one
and
i
did
see
no
reason
why
he
should
be
hurting
himself
to
get
around
to
windward
like
that
maybe
it
was
five
minutes
i
watched
number
one
loping
along
like
there
was
nothing
urgent
and
he
was
just
merely
going
somewhere
and
taking
his
time
for
it
and
number
two
quirting
and
spurring
like
seconds
was
diamonds
i
wish
they
was
that
valuable
to
you
hinted
pink
they
ai
so
take
it
easy
well
pretty
soon
they
got
closer
together
and
then
number
two
unhooked
something
on
his
saddle
that
caught
the
light
there
where
i
got
my
field
glasses
into
play
i
drew
a
bead
with
and
seen
right
off
it
was
a
gun
and
i
had
no
more
than
got
my
brain
adjusted
to
grasp
his
idea
when
he
puts
it
back
and
takes
down
his
rope
that
there
andy
added
naïvely
promised
more
real
interest
guns
is
commonplace
i
took
down
the
glasses
long
enough
to
size
up
the
layout
glasses
you
know
are
mighty
deceiving
when
it
comes
to
relative
distances
and
a
hilltop
a
mile
back
looks
through
the
glass
like
just
stepping
over
a
ditch
with
the
naked
eye
i
could
see
that
they
were
coming
together
pretty
quick
and
they
done
so
number
one
looks
back
but
whether
he
seen
number
two
i
could
say
seemed
to
me
like
he
just
glanced
back
casual
and
in
the
wrong
direction
be
that
is
it
may
number
two
edged
off
a
little
and
rode
in
behind
a
bunch
uh
mesquite
and
then
i
seen
that
the
trail
took
a
turn
right
there
so
he
pulled
up
and
stood
still
till
the
other
one
had
ambled
past
and
then
he
whirled
out
into
the
trail
and
swung
his
loop
when
i
got
the
glasses
focused
on
again
he
had
number
one
snared
all
right
and
had
took
his
turns
the
hoss
he
was
riding
it
was
a
buckskin
set
back
and
yanked
number
one
end
over
end
out
uh
the
saddle
and
number
one
hoss
stampeded
off
through
the
brush
number
two
dug
in
his
spurs
and
went
off
the
trail
and
across
country
dragging
the
other
fellow
and
him
bouncing
over
the
rough
spots
something
horrible
i
do
know
what
got
the
matter
uh
me
then
i
could
do
anything
but
sit
there
on
my
rock
and
watch
through
the
glasses
anyway
while
they
looked
close
enough
to
hit
with
a
rock
they
was
off
a
mile
or
more
so
while
i
could
see
it
all
i
could
do
nothing
to
prevent
i
could
even
hear
number
one
yell
supposing
he
done
any
hollering
which
the
chances
is
he
did
a
plenty
it
was
for
all
the
world
like
one
uh
these
moving
pictures
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
case
uh
dragging
to
death
but
it
was
it
looked
to
me
a
heap
worse
number
two
dragged
his
man
a
ways
i
reckon
till
he
was
plumb
helpless
and
then
he
pulled
up
and
rode
back
to
where
he
laid
the
fellow
tried
to
get
up
and
did
get
partly
on
his
knees
and
number
one
standing
over
him
watching
what
passed
i
do
know
not
having
my
hearing
magnified
like
my
sight
was
i
framed
it
up
that
number
two
was
getting
his
past
present
and
future
read
out
to
him
what
i
call
a
free
life
reading
the
rope
was
pinning
his
arms
down
to
his
sides
and
number
two
was
taking
blamed
good
care
there
was
any
slack
so
fast
as
he
tried
to
get
up
he
was
yanked
back
from
first
to
last
he
never
had
a
ghost
of
a
show
then
number
two
reaches
back
deliberate
and
draws
his
gun
and
commences
shooting
and
i
commences
hollering
for
him
to
quit
it
and
me
a
mile
off
and
ca
do
nothing
i
tell
yuh
right
now
that
was
about
the
worst
deal
i
ever
went
up
against
to
set
there
on
that
pinnacle
and
watch
murder
done
in
cold
blood
and
me
plumb
helpless
the
first
shot
was
none
fatal
as
i
could
see
plainer
than
was
pleasant
looked
to
me
like
he
wanted
to
string
out
the
agony
it
was
a
clear
case
uh
butchery
from
start
to
finish
the
damnedest
act
a
white
man
could
be
guilty
of
he
empties
his
counting
the
and
waits
a
minute
watching
like
a
cat
does
a
gopher
i
was
sweating
cold
but
i
kept
my
eyes
glued
to
them
glasses
like
a
man
in
a
nightmare
when
he
makes
sure
the
fellow
dead
he
rides
alongside
and
flips
off
the
rope
with
the
buckskin
snorting
and
edging
off
at
the
i
reckon
while
he
coiling
his
rope
calm
as
if
just
merely
roped
a
yearling
the
buckskin
gets
his
head
plants
it
and
turns
on
the
fireworks
when
that
hoss
starts
in
pitching
i
come
alive
and
drop
the
glasses
into
their
case
and
make
a
jump
for
my
own
hoss
if
the
lord
lets
me
come
up
with
that
devil
i
aim
to
deal
out
a
case
uh
justice
on
my
own
hook
i
was
in
a
right
proper
humor
for
doing
him
like
he
done
the
other
fellow
and
not
ask
no
questions
looked
to
me
like
he
had
it
coming
all
right
i
just
stuck
my
toe
in
the
stirrup
when
down
comes
the
fog
like
a
wet
blanket
on
everything
i
could
see
twenty
feet
andy
stopped
and
reached
for
a
burning
twig
to
relight
his
cigarette
the
happy
family
was
breathing
hard
with
the
spell
of
the
story
did
yuh
git
him
happy
jack
asked
hoarsely
andy
took
a
long
puff
at
his
cigarette
well
i
holy
smoke
what
the
matter
with
blink
for
blink
was
leaning
forward
half
crouched
like
a
cat
about
to
pounce
and
was
glaring
fixedly
at
andy
with
lips
drawn
back
in
a
snarl
the
happy
family
looked
then
stared
blink
relaxed
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
grinned
unmirthfully
he
got
up
pulled
up
his
chaps
with
the
peculiar
hitching
gesture
which
comes
with
long
practice
and
grows
to
be
second
nature
and
stared
back
defiantly
at
the
wondering
faces
lighted
by
the
dancing
flames
he
turned
his
back
coolly
upon
them
and
walked
away
to
where
his
horse
stood
took
up
the
reins
and
stuck
his
toe
in
the
stirrup
went
up
and
landed
in
the
saddle
ready
for
anything
then
he
wheeled
the
big
sorrel
so
that
he
faced
those
at
the
a
man
a
damned
fool
andy
green
to
see
more
than
is
meant
for
him
to
see
he
plumb
crazy
to
go
round
blatting
all
he
knows
you
tell
that
tale
again
amigo
there
was
the
pop
of
a
pistol
a
puff
of
blue
against
the
gray
and
then
the
fog
reached
out
and
gathered
blink
and
the
sorrel
to
itself
only
the
clatter
of
galloping
hoofs
came
to
them
from
behind
the
damp
curtain
andy
green
was
lying
on
his
back
in
the
grass
his
cigarette
smoking
dully
in
his
fingers
a
fast
widening
red
streak
trailing
down
from
his
temple
the
happy
family
rose
like
a
covey
of
frightened
chickens
before
the
echoes
were
done
playing
with
the
on
the
heels
of
shot
came
the
crack
of
happy
jack
howitzer
as
he
fired
blindly
toward
the
there
was
more
shooting
while
they
scurried
to
where
their
horses
snorting
excitement
danced
uneasily
at
the
edge
of
the
bushes
only
one
man
spoke
and
that
was
pink
who
stopped
just
as
he
was
about
to
swing
into
the
saddle
damme
for
leaving
my
gun
in
camp
i
stay
with
andy
go
on
and
if
yuh
do
get
him
i
he
turned
back
cursing
hysterically
and
knelt
beside
the
long
figure
in
the
grass
there
was
a
tumult
of
sound
as
the
three
raced
off
in
pursuit
so
close
that
the
flight
of
the
fugitive
was
still
distinct
in
the
fog
while
they
raced
they
cursed
the
fog
that
shielded
from
their
vengeance
their
quarry
and
made
such
riding
as
theirs
a
blind
gamble
with
the
chances
all
in
favor
of
broken
bones
their
only
comfort
the
knowledge
that
blink
could
see
no
better
than
could
they
they
did
not
talk
just
at
first
they
did
not
even
wonder
if
andy
was
dead
every
nerve
every
muscle
and
every
thought
was
concentrated
upon
the
pursuit
of
blink
it
was
the
instant
rising
to
meet
an
occasion
undreamed
of
in
advance
to
do
the
only
thing
possible
without
loss
of
a
second
in
parley
truly
it
were
ill
for
blink
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
those
three
in
that
mood
they
rode
with
quirt
and
spur
guided
only
by
the
muffled
of
blink
horse
fleeing
always
just
before
whenever
the
seemed
a
bit
closer
happy
jack
would
lift
his
and
send
a
shot
at
random
toward
the
sound
or
weary
or
slim
would
take
a
chance
with
their
shorter
guns
but
never
once
did
they
pull
rein
for
steep
or
gulley
and
never
once
did
the
fail
to
come
back
to
them
from
out
the
fog
the
chase
had
led
afar
and
the
pace
was
telling
on
their
mounts
which
breathed
asthmatically
slim
best
he
could
do
was
falling
behind
weary
horse
stumbled
and
went
to
his
knees
so
that
happy
jack
forged
ahead
just
when
the
wind
puffing
up
from
the
open
blew
aside
the
gray
it
was
not
a
minute
nor
half
that
but
it
was
long
enough
for
happy
jack
to
see
clear
and
close
blink
pausing
irresolutely
upon
the
edge
of
a
deep
gulley
happy
jack
gave
a
hoarse
croak
of
triumph
and
fired
just
as
the
swayed
back
maddeningly
happy
jack
nearly
wept
with
pure
rage
weary
and
slim
came
up
and
together
they
galloped
to
the
place
riding
by
instinct
of
direction
for
there
was
no
longer
any
sound
to
guide
ten
minutes
they
spent
searching
the
gulley
edge
then
they
saw
dimly
twenty
feet
below
a
huddled
object
in
the
brush
they
climbed
down
none
too
warily
though
they
knew
well
what
might
be
lying
venomous
as
a
coiled
rattler
in
wait
for
them
below
slipping
and
sliding
in
the
grass
they
reached
the
spot
to
find
the
big
sorrel
crumpled
there
dead
they
searched
anxiously
and
futilely
for
more
but
blink
was
not
there
nor
was
there
anything
to
show
that
he
had
ever
been
there
then
not
fear
perhaps
but
caution
came
to
happy
jack
aw
say
he
got
away
on
us
the
skunk
he
down
there
in
the
brush
somewheres
waiting
for
somebody
to
go
in
and
drag
him
out
by
the
ear
i
betche
he
laying
low
right
now
waiting
for
a
chance
to
us
we
better
git
back
out
uh
this
he
edged
away
his
eyes
on
the
thicket
just
below
to
ride
in
there
was
impossible
even
to
the
happy
family
in
whole
or
in
part
to
go
in
afoot
was
not
at
all
to
the
liking
of
happy
jack
slim
gave
a
comprehensive
stare
at
the
unpromising
surroundings
and
followed
happy
jack
by
golly
that
right
yuh
do
git
me
into
no
hole
like
that
he
assented
weary
foolhardy
to
the
last
stayed
longest
but
even
weary
could
not
but
admit
that
the
case
was
hopeless
the
brush
was
thick
and
filled
the
gully
probably
from
end
to
end
riding
through
it
was
impossible
and
hunting
it
through
on
foot
would
be
nothing
but
suicide
with
a
man
like
blink
hidden
away
in
its
depths
they
climbed
back
to
the
rim
remounted
and
rode
as
straight
as
might
be
for
the
and
what
lay
beside
with
pink
on
guard
it
was
near
noon
when
through
the
lightening
fog
they
reached
the
place
and
discovered
that
andy
though
unconscious
was
not
dead
they
found
upon
examination
of
his
hurt
that
the
bullet
had
ploughed
along
the
side
of
his
head
above
his
ear
but
just
how
serious
it
might
be
they
did
not
know
pink
having
a
fresh
horse
and
aching
for
action
mounted
and
rode
in
much
haste
to
camp
that
the
might
be
brought
out
to
take
andy
in
to
the
ranch
and
the
ministrations
of
the
little
doctor
also
he
must
notify
the
crew
and
get
them
out
searching
for
blink
all
that
night
and
the
next
day
the
cowboys
rode
and
the
next
they
raked
the
foothills
gulley
by
gulley
their
purpose
grim
it
would
probably
be
a
case
of
with
them
and
nothing
saved
blink
save
the
fact
that
never
once
did
any
man
of
the
flying
u
gain
sight
of
him
he
had
vanished
completely
after
that
fleeting
glimpse
happy
jack
had
gained
and
in
the
end
the
flying
u
was
compelled
to
own
defeat
upon
one
point
they
congratulated
themselves
andy
bandaged
as
he
was
had
escaped
with
a
furrow
ploughed
through
the
scalp
though
it
was
not
the
fault
of
blink
that
he
was
alive
and
able
to
discuss
the
affair
with
the
others
more
exactly
to
answer
the
questions
they
fired
at
him
did
you
recognize
him
as
being
the
murderer
weary
asked
him
curiously
andy
moved
uneasily
on
his
bed
no
i
did
by
gracious
you
must
think
i
a
plumb
fool
well
yuh
sure
hit
the
mark
whether
yuh
meant
to
or
not
pink
asserted
he
was
the
jasper
all
right
look
how
he
was
glaring
at
yuh
while
you
were
telling
about
it
knew
he
was
the
party
and
having
a
guilty
conscience
he
naturally
supposed
yuh
recognized
him
from
the
start
well
i
did
snapped
andy
ungraciously
and
they
put
it
down
to
the
peevishness
of
invalidism
and
overlooked
the
tone
chip
has
given
his
description
in
to
the
sheriff
soothed
weary
and
if
he
gets
off
he
sure
a
good
one
and
i
heard
that
the
sheriff
wired
down
to
the
san
simon
country
and
told
their
man
was
up
here
mama
what
bad
breaks
a
man
will
make
when
he
on
the
dodge
if
blink
had
kept
his
face
closed
and
acted
normal
nobody
would
have
got
next
andy
did
know
he
was
the
fellow
that
done
it
but
it
sure
was
queer
the
way
the
play
come
up
was
it
andy
andy
merely
grunted
he
did
not
like
to
dwell
upon
the
subject
and
he
showed
it
plainly
by
golly
he
must
sure
have
had
it
in
for
that
fellow
mused
slim
ponderously
to
kill
him
the
way
andy
says
he
did
by
golly
yuh
ca
wonder
his
eyes
stuck
out
when
he
heard
andy
telling
us
all
about
it
i
betche
he
lays
for
andy
yet
and
gits
him
predicted
happy
jack
felicitously
he
wo
rest
whilst
an
is
running
around
loose
i
betche
he
cached
in
the
hills
right
now
watching
his
chance
oh
go
to
hell
the
whole
lot
of
yuh
flared
andy
rising
to
an
elbow
what
the
dickens
are
yuh
roosting
around
here
for
why
yuh
go
on
out
to
camp
where
yuh
belong
you
a
nice
bunch
to
set
around
comforting
the
sick
darn
yuh
whereupon
they
took
the
hint
and
departed
assuring
andy
by
way
of
farewell
that
he
was
an
unappreciative
cuss
and
did
deserve
any
sympathy
or
they
also
condoled
openly
with
pink
because
he
had
been
detailed
as
nurse
and
advised
him
to
sit
right
down
on
andy
if
he
got
too
sassy
and
haughty
over
being
shot
up
by
a
real
outlaw
they
said
that
any
fool
could
build
himself
a
bunch
of
trouble
with
a
homicidal
lunatic
like
blink
and
it
was
anything
to
get
vain
over
pink
slammed
the
door
upon
their
jibes
and
offered
andy
a
cigarette
he
had
just
rolled
not
that
andy
was
too
sick
to
roll
his
own
but
because
pink
was
notably
toward
a
sick
man
and
was
prone
to
indulge
himself
in
trifling
attentions
yuh
do
want
to
mind
that
bunch
he
placated
they
mean
all
right
but
they
just
ca
help
joshing
a
man
to
death
andy
accepted
also
a
light
for
the
cigarette
and
smoked
moodily
it
ai
their
joshing
he
explained
after
a
minute
it
puzzling
over
what
i
ca
understand
that
gets
on
my
nerves
i
ca
see
through
the
thing
pink
no
way
i
look
at
it
looks
plain
enough
to
me
pink
answered
uh
course
it
funny
blink
should
be
the
man
and
be
setting
there
listening
yes
but
darn
it
all
pink
there
a
funnier
side
to
it
than
that
and
it
near
driving
me
crazy
trying
to
figure
it
out
yuh
tell
anybody
pink
but
it
like
this
i
was
just
merely
and
simply
romancing
when
i
told
that
there
tale
i
never
was
south
uh
the
wyoming
line
except
when
i
was
riding
in
a
circus
and
toured
through
and
that
the
truth
i
never
was
down
in
the
san
simon
basin
i
never
set
on
no
pinnacle
with
no
field
glasses
andy
stopped
short
his
labored
confession
to
gaze
with
deep
disgust
upon
pink
convulsed
figure
well
he
snapped
settling
back
on
the
pillow
darn
yuh
and
show
your
ignorance
by
gracious
i
wish
could
see
the
joke
he
reached
up
gingerly
and
readjusted
the
bandage
on
his
head
eyed
pink
sourly
a
moment
and
with
a
grunt
eloquent
of
the
mood
he
was
in
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
miss
martin
mission
when
andy
green
and
shining
with
soap
and
towel
polish
walked
into
the
of
the
dry
lake
hotel
he
felt
not
the
slightest
premonition
of
what
was
about
to
befall
his
chief
sensation
was
the
hunger
which
comes
of
early
rising
and
of
many
hours
spent
in
the
open
and
beyond
that
he
was
hoping
that
the
chinaman
cook
had
made
some
like
he
had
the
week
before
his
eyes
searching
unobtrusively
the
long
table
bearing
the
unmistakable
signs
of
many
other
hungry
men
gone
before
for
andy
was
late
failed
to
warn
him
he
pulled
out
his
chair
and
sat
down
still
looking
for
good
cried
an
eager
feminine
voice
just
across
the
table
andy
started
guiltily
he
had
been
dimly
aware
that
some
one
was
sitting
there
but
being
occupied
with
other
things
had
not
given
a
thought
to
the
sitter
or
a
glance
now
he
did
both
while
he
said
good
afternoon
with
perfunctory
politeness
such
a
day
is
it
invigorating
like
rare
old
wine
andy
assented
somewhat
dubiously
it
had
never
just
struck
him
that
way
he
thought
fleetingly
that
perhaps
it
was
because
he
had
never
come
across
any
rare
old
wine
he
ventured
another
glance
she
was
not
young
and
she
wore
glasses
behind
which
twinkled
very
bright
eyes
of
a
shade
of
brown
she
had
unpleasantly
regular
hair
waves
on
her
temples
and
underneath
the
waves
showed
streaks
of
gray
also
she
wore
a
black
silk
waist
and
somebody
picture
made
into
a
brooch
at
her
throat
further
andy
dared
not
observe
it
was
enough
for
one
glance
he
looked
again
for
the
the
strange
lady
ingratiatingly
passed
him
the
bread
you
a
cowboy
are
you
was
the
disconcerting
question
that
accompanied
the
bread
well
i
er
i
punch
cows
he
admitted
guardedly
his
gaze
elsewhere
than
on
her
face
i
you
were
a
cowboy
the
moment
you
entered
the
door
i
could
tell
by
the
tan
and
the
straight
elastic
walk
and
the
silk
handkerchief
knotted
around
your
throat
in
that
picturesque
fashion
oh
i
older
than
you
and
dare
speak
as
i
think
i
read
a
great
deal
about
cowboys
and
i
do
admire
you
all
as
a
type
of
free
noble
manhood
andy
looked
exactly
as
if
someone
had
caught
him
at
something
exceedingly
foolish
he
tried
to
sugar
his
coffee
calmly
and
so
sent
it
sloshing
all
over
the
saucer
do
you
live
near
here
she
asked
next
beaming
upon
him
in
the
orthodox
motherly
fashion
yes
not
very
near
he
was
betrayed
into
saying
and
she
might
make
what
she
could
of
it
he
had
not
said
before
since
he
had
gone
to
school
oh
i
heard
how
you
western
folks
measure
distances
she
teased
about
how
many
miles
about
twenty
i
suppose
that
is
not
far
to
you
knights
of
the
plains
at
home
it
would
be
called
a
long
journey
why
i
have
known
numbers
of
old
men
and
women
who
have
never
been
so
far
from
their
own
doors
in
their
lives
what
would
you
think
i
wonder
of
their
little
forty
acre
farms
andy
had
been
brought
to
his
sixteenth
tumultuous
birthday
on
a
in
the
edge
of
a
town
but
he
did
not
say
so
he
shook
his
head
vaguely
and
said
he
did
know
andy
green
however
was
not
famous
for
clinging
ever
to
the
truth
you
out
here
in
this
great
wide
free
land
with
the
free
winds
ever
blowing
and
the
clouds
will
you
pass
the
butter
please
andy
hated
to
interrupt
but
he
was
hungry
the
strange
lady
passed
the
butter
and
sent
with
it
a
smile
i
have
read
and
heard
so
much
about
this
wild
free
life
and
my
heart
has
gone
out
to
the
noble
fellows
living
their
lonely
life
with
their
cattle
and
their
faithful
dogs
lying
beside
their
at
night
while
the
stars
stood
guard
andy
forgot
his
personal
embarrassment
and
began
to
perk
up
his
ears
this
was
growing
and
i
have
felt
how
lonely
they
must
be
with
their
rude
fare
and
few
pleasures
and
what
a
field
there
must
be
among
them
for
a
great
and
noble
work
to
uplift
them
and
bring
into
their
lonely
lives
a
broader
deeper
meaning
to
help
them
to
help
themselves
to
be
better
nobler
men
and
women
we
do
have
any
lady
cowpunchers
out
here
interposed
andy
mildly
the
strange
lady
had
merely
gone
astray
a
bit
being
accustomed
to
addressing
mothers
meetings
and
the
like
she
recovered
herself
easily
nobler
men
the
bulwarks
of
our
nation
she
stopped
and
eyed
andy
archly
andy
having
observed
that
her
neck
was
scrawny
with
certain
cords
down
the
sides
that
moved
unpleasantly
when
she
talked
tried
not
to
look
i
wonder
if
you
can
guess
what
brings
me
out
here
away
from
home
and
friends
can
you
guess
andy
thought
of
several
things
but
he
could
not
feel
that
it
would
be
polite
to
mention
them
agent
for
complexion
stuff
for
instance
and
next
to
that
wanting
a
husband
he
shook
his
head
again
and
looked
at
his
potato
you
the
tone
was
the
one
commonly
employed
for
the
encouragement
and
consequent
demoralization
of
a
primary
class
andy
realized
that
he
was
being
talked
down
to
and
his
combativeness
awoke
well
away
back
in
my
home
town
a
woman
club
has
been
thinking
of
all
you
lonely
fellows
and
have
felt
their
hearts
swell
with
a
desire
to
help
you
so
far
from
home
and
mother
influence
with
only
the
coarse
pleasures
of
the
west
and
amid
all
the
temptations
that
lie
in
wait
she
caught
herself
back
from
and
they
have
sent
away
out
here
to
be
your
to
help
you
to
help
yourselves
become
better
truer
men
and
she
did
not
say
women
though
poor
soul
she
came
near
it
so
i
am
going
to
be
your
friend
i
want
to
get
in
touch
with
you
all
first
to
win
your
confidence
and
teach
you
to
look
upon
me
in
the
light
of
a
mother
then
when
i
have
won
your
confidence
i
want
to
organize
a
cowboys
mutual
improvement
and
social
society
to
help
you
in
the
way
of
and
to
resist
the
snares
laid
for
homeless
boys
like
you
do
you
think
i
very
she
was
smiling
at
him
again
leaning
back
in
her
chair
and
regarding
him
playfully
over
her
glasses
you
sure
are
andy
assented
deliberately
refraining
from
saying
yes
as
had
been
his
impulse
to
come
away
out
here
among
all
you
wild
cowboys
with
your
guns
buckled
on
and
your
wicked
little
mustangs
are
you
sure
you
wo
shoot
me
andy
eyed
her
pityingly
if
she
meant
it
he
thought
she
certainly
was
wabbly
in
her
mind
if
she
thought
that
was
the
only
kind
of
talk
he
could
savvy
then
she
was
a
blamed
idiot
either
way
he
felt
antagonistic
the
law
shall
be
respected
in
your
case
he
told
her
very
gravely
she
smiled
almost
as
if
she
could
see
the
joke
after
which
she
became
twitteringly
eagerly
in
earnest
since
you
live
near
here
you
must
know
the
whitmores
miss
whitmore
came
out
here
two
or
three
years
ago
and
married
her
brother
coachman
i
believe
though
i
heard
conflicting
stories
about
it
some
have
said
he
was
an
artist
and
others
that
he
was
a
jockey
or
i
heard
too
that
he
was
a
cowboy
but
miss
whitmore
certainly
wrote
about
this
young
man
driving
her
brother
carriage
however
she
is
married
and
i
have
a
letter
of
introduction
to
her
the
president
of
our
club
used
to
be
a
schoolmate
of
her
mother
i
shall
stop
with
them
i
have
heard
so
much
about
the
western
hospitality
and
shall
get
into
touch
with
my
cowboys
from
the
vantage
point
of
proximity
did
you
say
you
know
them
i
work
for
them
andy
told
her
truthfully
in
his
deep
amazement
and
immediately
repented
and
wished
that
he
had
not
been
so
virtuous
with
andy
to
wish
was
to
do
given
the
opportunity
then
i
can
go
with
you
out
to
their
farm
ranchero
how
nice
and
on
the
way
you
can
tell
me
all
about
yourself
and
your
life
and
hopes
because
i
do
want
to
get
in
touch
with
you
all
you
know
and
i
tell
you
all
my
plans
for
you
i
have
some
plans
and
we
be
very
good
friends
by
the
time
we
reach
our
destination
sure
i
want
you
to
feel
from
the
start
that
i
am
a
true
friend
and
that
i
have
your
welfare
very
much
at
heart
without
the
confidence
of
my
cowboys
i
can
do
nothing
are
there
any
more
at
home
like
you
andy
looked
at
her
suspiciously
but
it
was
so
evident
she
never
meant
to
quote
comic
opera
that
he
merely
wondered
anew
he
struggled
feebly
against
temptation
and
fell
from
grace
quite
willingly
it
is
polite
to
throw
a
load
at
a
lady
but
then
andy
felt
that
neither
was
it
polite
for
a
lady
to
come
out
with
the
avowed
intention
of
improving
him
and
his
fellows
it
looked
to
him
like
butting
in
where
she
was
not
wanted
or
needed
yes
there
quite
a
bunch
and
they
pretty
bad
i
believe
you
can
do
much
for
he
spoke
regretfully
do
they
she
asked
leaning
forward
and
speaking
in
the
hushed
voice
with
which
some
women
approach
a
tabooed
subject
yes
they
do
they
hard
drinkers
and
they
he
eyed
her
speculatively
trying
to
guess
the
worst
sins
in
her
category
they
play
cards
gamble
and
swear
and
smoke
cigarettes
and
all
the
more
need
of
someone
to
help
them
overcome
she
decided
solemnly
what
you
need
is
a
and
reading
room
here
so
that
the
young
men
will
have
some
place
to
go
other
than
the
saloons
i
shall
see
to
that
right
away
and
with
the
mutual
improvement
and
social
society
organized
and
working
smoothly
and
a
library
of
standard
works
for
recreation
together
with
earnest
personal
efforts
to
promote
temperance
and
i
feel
that
a
work
can
be
done
i
saw
you
drive
into
town
so
i
know
you
can
take
me
out
with
you
i
hope
you
are
going
to
start
soon
i
feel
very
impatient
to
reach
the
field
and
put
my
sickle
to
the
harvest
andy
mentally
threw
up
his
hands
before
this
unshakable
person
he
had
meant
to
tell
her
that
he
had
come
on
horseback
but
she
had
forestalled
him
he
had
meant
to
discourage
her
head
her
off
he
called
it
to
himself
but
there
seemed
no
way
of
doing
it
he
pushed
back
his
chair
and
rose
though
he
had
not
tasted
his
pie
and
it
was
lemon
pie
at
that
he
had
some
faint
notion
of
hurrying
out
of
town
and
home
before
she
could
have
time
to
get
ready
but
she
followed
him
to
the
door
and
chirped
over
his
shoulder
that
it
would
take
her
two
minutes
to
put
on
her
wraps
andy
groaned
he
tried
or
started
to
try
holding
out
at
rusty
brown
till
she
gave
up
in
despair
but
it
occurred
to
him
that
chip
had
asked
him
to
hurry
back
andy
groaned
again
and
got
the
team
she
did
not
wait
for
him
to
drive
around
to
the
hotel
for
her
possibly
she
suspected
his
intentions
at
any
rate
she
came
nipping
down
the
street
toward
the
stable
just
as
he
was
hooking
the
last
trace
and
she
was
all
ready
and
had
a
load
of
bags
and
bundles
i
not
going
to
begin
by
making
trouble
for
you
she
twittered
i
thought
i
could
just
as
well
come
down
here
to
the
wagon
as
have
you
drive
back
to
the
hotel
and
my
trunk
did
not
come
on
the
train
with
me
so
i
all
ready
andy
having
nothing
in
mind
that
he
dared
say
to
a
lady
helped
her
into
the
wagon
at
sundown
or
thereabouts
for
the
days
were
short
and
he
had
a
load
of
various
things
besides
care
andy
let
himself
wearily
into
the
where
was
assembled
the
happy
family
he
merely
grunted
when
they
spoke
to
him
and
threw
himself
heavily
down
upon
his
bunk
for
heaven
sake
somebody
roll
me
a
cigarette
i
too
wore
out
to
do
a
thing
and
i
have
had
a
smoke
since
dinner
he
groaned
after
a
minute
sick
asked
pink
solicitously
sick
as
a
dog
water
water
moaned
andy
all
at
once
he
rolled
over
upon
his
face
and
shook
with
laughter
more
than
a
little
hysterical
and
to
the
questioning
of
the
happy
family
gave
no
answer
but
howls
the
happy
family
began
to
look
at
one
another
uneasily
aw
let
up
happy
jack
bellowed
you
give
a
man
the
creeps
just
to
listen
at
yuh
i
going
to
empty
the
over
yuh
in
a
minute
pink
threatened
go
get
it
cal
it
half
full
andy
knew
well
the
metal
of
which
the
happy
family
was
made
and
the
night
was
cool
for
a
ducking
he
rolled
back
so
that
they
could
see
his
face
and
struggled
for
calm
in
a
minute
he
sat
up
and
merely
gurgled
well
say
i
had
to
do
something
or
die
he
explained
gasping
i
gone
through
a
heap
the
last
few
hours
and
i
was
right
where
i
could
do
a
thing
by
gracious
i
struck
the
ranch
about
as
near
as
a
man
can
get
and
recover
where
a
cigarette
what
you
gone
through
and
i
do
give
a
cuss
what
it
is
ai
a
marker
for
what
going
to
happen
if
yuh
do
loosen
up
on
the
history
said
jack
bates
firmly
andy
smoked
hungrily
while
he
surveyed
the
lot
how
calm
and
innocent
yuh
all
look
he
observed
musingly
with
your
hats
on
and
saying
words
that
rude
and
smoking
the
vile
weed
regardless
never
dreaming
what
going
to
drop
pretty
soon
quick
yuh
make
me
think
of
a
my
used
to
sing
a
lot
about
dreamed
not
of
danger
those
sinners
of
old
whom
hand
me
the
water
bucket
directed
pink
musically
oh
well
take
it
from
the
shoulder

i
was
only
trying
to
lead
up
to
it
gradual
but
yuh
have
it
raw
you
poor
dear

lonely
lives

to
be
you
sure

a
lot
of
it
too
a
woman

felt
the
burden
of
your
and

orneriness
and
has
sent
one
of
its
leading
members
out
here
to
reform
yuh
you
going
to
be
hazed
into
a
cowboys
mutual
improvement
and
social
society
and

a
yuh
mama
mine
broke
in
weary
i
have
thought
sometimes
when
andy
broke
loose
with
that
imagination
uh
his
that
he
gone
the
limit
but
next
time
he
always
raises
the
limit
out
uh
sight
he
like
the
good
book
says
he
prone
to
lie
as
the
sparks
andy
gazed
belligerently
at
the
skeptical
group
i
brought
her
out
from
town
he
said
doggedly
and
whilst
i
own
up
to
having
an
imagination
she
stranger
than
fiction
she
make
the
fellow
that
wrote
she
lay
down
with
a
headache
she
come
out
here
to
help
us
cowboys

nobler
better
lives
she
going
to
learn

to
fill

when
yuh
get
set
afoot
out
on
the
range
or
anything
like
that
yuh
wo
put
in
your
time
cussing
the
miles
between
you
and
camp
you
have
a
pocket
edition
of
ado
about
nothing
to
read
or
the
speech
mark
anthony
made
when
he
was
running
for
office
or
supposing
yuh
left
all
in
camp
study
nature
there
sermons
in
stones
she
says
she
going
to
send
for
a
pocket
library
that
can
easy
be
took
on
roundup
say
i
guess
that
about
enough
interrupted
pink
restlessly
we
all
admit
you
the
biggest
liar
that
ever
come
west
of
the
mississippi
without
you
laying
it
on
any
deeper
whereupon
andy
rose
in
wrath
and
made
a
suggestive
movement
with
his
fist
if
i
was
romancing
he
declared
indignantly
i
do
a
smoother
job
when
i
do
lie
i
notice
yuh
all
believe
it
till
yuh
find
out
different
and
by
gracious
yuh
might
do
as
much
when
telling
the
truth
go
up
to
the
white
house
and
see
darn
yuh
if
yuh
do
find
miss
verbena
martin
up
there
telling
the
little
doctor
how
her
heart
goes
out
to
her
dear
cowboys
and
how
she
going
to
get
in
touch
with
and
help
lead
nobler
better
lives
you
can
kick
me
all
round
the
yard
and
i
hope
by
gracious
she
improve
yuh
yuh
sure
do
need
it
a
lot
the
happy
family
discussed
the
tale
freely
and
without
regard
for
the
feelings
of
andy
they
even
became
heated
and
impolite
and
they
made
threats
they
said
that
a
liar
like
him
ought
to
be
lynched
or
gagged
and
that
he
was
a
disgrace
to
the
outfit
in
the
end
however
they
decided
to
go
and
see
just
to
prove
to
andy
that
they
knew
he
lied
and
though
it
was
settled
that
weary
and
pink
should
be
the
investigating
committee
by
the
time
they
were
halfway
to
the
white
house
they
had
the
whole
happy
family
trailing
at
their
heels
a
light
snow
had
begun
to
fall
since
dark
and
they
hunched
their
shoulders
against
it
as
they
went
grouped
uncomfortably
just
outside
the
circle
of
light
cast
through
the
unshaded
window
they
gazed
silently
in
upon
chip
and
the
little
doctor
and
whitmore
and
upon
one
other
a
strange
lady
in
a
black
silk
shirtwaist
and
a
gold
watch
suspended
from
her
neck
by
a
chaste
black
silken
cord
a
strange
lady
with
symmetrical
waves
in
her
hair
and
gray
on
her
temples
and
with
glasses
and
an
eager
way
of
speaking
she
was
talking
very
rapidly
and
animatedly
and
the
others
were
listening
and
stealing
glances
now
and
then
at
one
another
once
while
they
watched
the
little
doctor
looked
at
chip
and
then
turned
her
face
toward
the
window
she
was
biting
her
lips
in
the
way
the
happy
family
had
learned
to
recognize
as
a
great
desire
to
laugh
it
all
looked
suspicious
and
corroborative
of
andy
story
and
the
happy
family
shifted
their
feet
uneasily
in
the
loose
snow
they
watched
and
saw
the
strange
lady
clasp
her
hands
together
and
lean
forward
and
where
her
voice
had
before
come
to
them
with
no
words
which
they
could
catch
distinctly
they
heard
her
say
something
quite
clearly
in
her
enthusiasm
eight
real
cowboys
almost
within
reach
i
must
see
them
before
i
sleep
i
must
get
in
touch
with
them
at
once
and
show
them
that
i
am
a
true
friend
come
bennett
wo
you
take
me
where
they
are
and
let
me
meet
my
boys
for
they
mine
in
spirit
my
heart
goes
out
to
them
the
happy
family
waited
to
hear
no
more
but
went
straightway
back
whence
they
had
come
and
their
going
savored
of
flight
mama
mine
she
coming
down
to
the
bunkhouse
said
weary
under
his
breath
and
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
at
the
white
house
bulking
large
in
the
night
let
go
on
down
to
the
stable
and
roost
in
the
hay
a
while
she
us
and
be
right
there
waiting
when
we
come
back
objected
andy
with
the
wisdom
gained
from
his
brief
acquaintance
with
the
lady
if
she
made
up
her
mind
to
call
on
us
there
no
way
under
heaven
to
head
her
off
they
halted
by
the
door
undecided
whether
to
go
in
or
to
stay
out
in
the
open
by
golly
she
do
improve
slim
asserted
pettishly
i
hate
books
like
strychnine
and
by
golly
she
ca
make
me
read
neither
if
there
anything
i
do
despise
it
groaned
cal
emmett
emerson
and
browning
and
shakespeare
and
named
andy
gloomily
whereat
pink
suddenly
pushed
open
the
door
and
went
in
as
goes
one
who
knows
exactly
what
he
is
about
to
do
they
followed
him
distressfully
and
silently
pink
went
immediately
to
his
bunk
and
began
pulling
off
his
boots
i
going
to
bed
he
told
them
you
fellows
can
stay
up
and
entertain
her
if
yuh
want
to
wo
they
caught
the
idea
and
disrobed
hastily
though
the
evening
was
young
irish
blew
out
the
lamp
and
dove
under
the
blankets
just
as
voices
came
faintly
from
up
the
hill
so
that
when
chip
rapped
a
warning
with
his
knuckles
on
the
door
there
was
no
sound
within
save
an
artificial
snore
from
the
corner
where
lay
pink
chip
was
not
in
the
habit
of
knocking
before
he
entered
but
he
repeated
the
summons
with
emphasis
who
drawled
sleepily
a
voice
the
voice
of
weary
oh
i
do
believe
they
retired
came
in
a
perturbed
feminine
tone
to
the
listening
ears
of
the
happy
family
gone
to
bed
cried
chip
gravely
hours
ago
lied
andy
fluently
we
plumb
wore
out
happened
oh
do
disturb
the
poor
fellows
they
tired
and
need
their
rest
came
the
perturbed
tone
again
after
that
the
voices
and
the
footsteps
went
up
the
hill
again
and
the
happy
family
breathed
freer
incidentally
pink
stopped
snoring
and
made
a
cigarette
going
to
bed
at
or
thereabouts
was
not
the
custom
of
the
happy
family
but
they
stayed
under
the
covers
and
smoked
and
discussed
the
situation
they
dared
not
have
a
light
and
the
night
was
longer
than
they
had
ever
known
a
night
to
be
for
it
was
late
before
they
slept
it
was
well
that
miss
verbena
martin
could
not
overhear
their
talk
which
was
unchivalrous
and
unfriendly
in
the
extreme
the
general
opinion
seemed
to
be
that
old
maid
improvers
would
better
stay
at
home
where
they
might
possibly
be
welcome
and
that
when
the
happy
family
wanted
improving
they
would
let
her
know
cal
emmett
said
that
he
would
mind
if
they
had
only
sent
a
young
pretty
one
happy
jack
prophesied
plenty
of
trouble
and
boasted
that
she
could
haul
into
no
slim
declared
again
that
by
golly
she
would
do
no
improving
on
and
the
others
weary
and
irish
and
pink
and
jack
bates
and
andy
discussed
ways
and
means
and
failed
always
to
agree
when
each
one
hoots
derision
at
all
plans
but
his
own
it
is
easy
guessing
what
will
be
the
result
in
this
particular
instance
the
result
was
voices
raised
in
argument
voices
that
reached
chip
grinning
and
listening
on
the
porch
of
the
white
house
and
tardy
slumber
overtaking
a
disgruntled
happy
family
on
the
brink
of
violence
it
was
not
a
particularly
happy
family
that
woke
to
memory
and
a
snowy
sunday
woke
late
because
of
the
disturbing
evening
when
they
spoke
to
one
another
their
voices
were
but
growls
and
when
they
trailed
through
the
snow
to
their
breakfast
they
went
in
moody
silence
they
had
just
brightened
a
bit
before
patsy
sunday
breakfast
which
included
and
maple
syrup
when
the
door
was
pushed
quietly
open
and
the
little
doctor
came
in
followed
closely
by
miss
martin
an
apologetic
little
doctor
who
seemed
by
her
very
manner
of
entering
to
implore
them
not
to
blame
for
the
intrusion
miss
martin
was
not
apologetic
she
was
disconcertingly
eager
and
glad
to
meet
them
and
pathetically
anxious
to
win
their
favor
miss
martin
talked
and
the
happy
family
ate
hurriedly
and
with
lowered
eyelids
miss
martin
asked
questions
and
the
happy
family
kicked
one
another
shins
under
the
table
by
way
of
urging
someone
to
reply
for
this
reason
there
was
a
quite
perceptible
pause
between
question
and
answer
and
the
answer
was
invariably
the
soul
of
wit
according
to
that
famous
recipe
miss
martin
told
them
naively
all
about
her
hopes
and
her
plans
and
herself
and
about
the
distant
woman
club
that
took
so
great
an
interest
in
their
welfare
and
the
happy
family
listened
dejectedly
and
tried
to
be
polite
also
they
did
not
relish
the
as
usual
and
patsy
had
half
the
batter
left
when
the
meal
was
over
instead
of
being
obliged
to
mix
more
as
was
usually
the
case
when
they
had
eaten
the
happy
family
filed
out
decorously
and
went
hastily
down
to
the
stables
they
did
not
say
much
but
they
did
glance
over
their
shoulders
uneasily
once
or
twice
the
old
girl
is
sure
hot
on
our
trail
pink
remarked
when
they
were
safely
through
the
big
gate
she
must
uh
got
us
mixed
up
with
some
wild
west
show
in
her
mind
josephine
well
by
golly
she
do
improve
slim
repeated
for
about
the
tenth
time
the
horses
were
all
fed
and
everything
tidy
for
the
day
and
several
saddles
were
being
hauled
down
significantly
from
their
pegs
when
irish
delivered
himself
of
a
speech
short
but
to
the
point
irish
had
been
very
quiet
and
had
taken
no
part
in
the
discussion
that
had
waxed
hot
all
that
morning
now
see
here
he
said
in
his
decided
way
maybe
it
did
strike
you
as
anything
but
funny
which
it
sure
is
but
yuh
want
to
remember
that
the
old
girl
has
come
a
dickens
of
a
long
ways
to
do
us
some
good
she
been
laying
awake
nights
thinking
about
how
we
get
to
calling
her
something
nice
angel
of
the
roundup
maybe
you
tell
she
that
romantic
and
right
here
is
where
i
going
to
give
the
old
girl
the
worth
of
her
money
it
wo
hurt
letting
her
talk
wild
and
foolish
at
us
once
a
week
maybe
and
the
poor
old
thing
just
be
tickled
to
death
thinking
what
a
lot
uh
good
doing
she
wo
stay
long
and
well
i
go
in
if
she
feel
better
and
more
good
to
the
world
improving
me
she
got
my
permission
i
guess
i
can
stand
it
a
while
the
happy
family
looked
at
him
queerly
for
if
there
was
a
black
sheep
in
the
flock
irish
was
certainly
the
man
and
to
have
irish
take
the
stand
he
did
was
to
say
the
least
unexpected
cal
emmett
blurted
the
real
cause
of
their
astonishment
you
have
to
sign
the
pledge
first
pass
he
said
that
going
to
be
the
ante
in
game
how
well
i
do
play
nobody
hand
or
stake
anybody
chips
but
my
own
irish
retorted
the
blood
showing
under
the
tan
on
his
cheeks
and
we
wo
roll
a
cigarette
even
by
golly
reminded
slim
for
miss
martin
whether
intentionally
or
not
had
made
plain
to
them
the
platform
of
the
new
society
irish
got
some
deep
creases
between
his
eyebrows
and
put
back
his
saddle
you
can
do
as
yuh
like
he
said
coldly
i
going
to
stay
and
go
to
meeting
this
afternoon
according
to
her
invite
if
going
to
make
that
poor
old
freak
feel
any
better
thinking
she
a
real
missionary
he
turned
and
walked
out
of
the
stable
without
finishing
the
sentence
and
the
happy
family
stood
quite
still
and
watched
him
go
pink
it
was
who
first
spoke
i
ai
the
boy
to
let
any
like
irish
hit
a
gait
i
ca
follow
he
dimpled
and
took
the
saddle
reluctantly
off
toots
if
he
can
stand
it
i
guess
i
can
weary
loosened
his
latigo
if
cadwolloper
is
going
to
learn
poetry
i
will
too
he
grinned
mama
it
be
good
as
a
circus
i
never
thought
uh
that
before
i
could
miss
it
oh
well
if
you
fellows
take
a
hand
i
sure
have
to
be
there
to
see
andy
decided
two
did
she
say
i
hate
to
be
called
a
quitter
pink
remarked
dispiritedly
to
the
happy
family
in
general
a
harassed
looking
happy
family
which
sat
around
and
said
little
and
watched
the
clock
in
an
hour
they
would
be
due
to
attend
the
second
meeting
of
the
and
one
would
think
from
the
look
of
them
that
they
were
about
to
be
hanged
i
hate
to
be
called
a
quitter
but
right
here
where
i
lay
down
the
rest
of
yuh
can
go
on
being
improved
if
yuh
want
to
darned
if
i
will
though
i
all
in
i
do
recollect
hearing
anybody
say
we
wanted
to
growled
jack
bates
irish
maybe
is
still
burning
with
a
desire
to
be
nice
and
chivalrous
but
you
can
count
me
out
one
dose
is
about
all
i
can
stand
by
golly
i
would
go
and
feel
that
foolish
again
not
if
yuh
paid
me
for
it
slim
declared
irish
grinned
and
reached
for
his
hat
i
done
my
damnettest
he
said
cheerfully
i
made
the
old
girl
happy
once
now
one
irish
mallory
is
due
to
have
a
little
joy
coming
his
way
i
going
to
town
break
break
on
thy
cold
gray
crags
oh
sea
and
i
would
that
my
tongue
could
utter
the
thoughts
that
come
over
me
you
will
observe
gentlemen
the
beautiful
sentiment
the
euphonious
rhythm
the
noble
weary
went
down
still
declaiming
mincingly
beneath
four
irate
bodies
that
hurled
themselves
toward
him
and
upon
him
we
break
break
break
every
bone
in
your
body
if
you
do
shut
up
you
will
observe
the
beautiful
sentiment
of
a
while
cried
pink
viciously
i
had
the
euphonious
rhythm
of
my
sleep
broke
up
ever
since
i
set
there
and
listened
at
her
for
two
hours
josephine
irish
stopped
with
his
hand
on
the
door
knob
i
was
the
jay
that
started
it
he
admitted
contritely
but
honest
i
never
had
a
hunch
she
was
plumb
locoed
i
thought
she
was
just
simply
foolish
come
on
to
town
boys
such
is
the
power
of
suggestion
that
in
fifteen
minutes
the
happy
family
had
passed
out
of
sight
over
the
top
of
the
grade
all
save
andy
green
who
told
them
he
would
be
along
after
a
while
and
that
they
need
not
wait
he
looked
at
the
clock
smoked
a
meditative
cigarette
and
went
up
to
the
white
house
to
attend
the
second
meeting
of
the
mutual
improvement
and
social
society
when
he
faced
alone
miss
verbena
martin
and
explained
that
the
other
members
were
unavoidably
absent
because
they
had
a
grudge
against
a
man
in
dry
lake
and
had
gone
in
to
lynch
him
and
burn
the
town
miss
martin
was
shocked
into
postponing
the
meeting
andy
said
he
was
glad
because
he
wanted
to
go
in
and
see
the
fight
undoubtedly
he
assured
her
there
would
be
a
fight
and
probably
a
few
of
them
would
get
killed
off
he
reminded
her
that
he
had
told
her
right
in
the
start
that
they
were
a
bad
lot
and
that
she
would
have
hard
work
reforming
them
and
finally
he
made
her
promise
that
she
would
not
mention
to
anyone
what
he
had
told
her
because
it
would
be
safe
for
him
or
for
her
if
they
ever
got
to
hear
of
it
after
that
andy
also
took
the
trail
to
town
and
he
went
at
a
gallop
and
smiled
as
he
rode
miss
martin
reflected
shudderingly
upon
the
awful
details
of
the
crime
as
hinted
at
by
andy
and
packed
her
trunk
it
might
be
brave
and
noble
to
stay
and
work
among
all
those
savages
but
she
doubted
much
whether
it
were
after
all
her
duty
she
thought
of
many
ways
in
which
she
could
do
more
real
good
nearer
home
she
had
felt
all
along
that
these
cowboys
were
an
untrustworthy
lot
she
had
noticed
them
glancing
at
one
another
in
a
secret
and
treacherous
manner
all
through
the
last
meeting
and
she
was
positive
they
had
not
given
her
that
full
confidence
without
which
no
good
can
be
accomplished
that
fellow
they
called
happy
looked
capable
of
almost
any
crime
she
had
never
felt
quite
safe
in
his
presence
miss
martin
pictured
them
howling
and
dancing
around
the
burning
dwellings
of
their
enemies
shooting
every
one
they
could
see
miss
martin
had
imagination
of
a
sort
but
while
she
pictured
the
horrors
of
an
indian
massacre
she
continued
to
pack
her
and
to
consult
often
her
watch
when
she
could
do
no
more
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
would
better
see
if
someone
could
take
her
to
the
station
fortunately
for
all
concerned
somebody
could
one
might
go
further
and
say
that
somebody
was
quite
willing
to
strain
a
point
even
in
order
to
get
her
there
in
time
for
the
next
train
the
happy
family
was
gathered
in
rusty
brown
place
watching
irish
do
things
to
a
from
lonesome
prairie
in
a
game
of
pool
they
were
just
giving
vent
to
a
prolonged
whoop
of
derision
at
the
play
when
a
rig
flashed
by
the
window
weary
stopped
with
his
mouth
wide
open
and
stared
leaned
to
the
window
and
craned
to
see
more
clearly
mama
mine
he
ejaculated
incredulously
i
could
swear
i
saw
miss
verbena
in
that
rig
with
her
trunk
and
headed
towards
the
depot
feel
my
pulse
cadwolloper
and
see
if
i
normal
but
pink
was
on
his
way
to
the
back
door
and
from
there
climbed
like
a
cat
to
the
roof
of
the
where
as
he
knew
from
experience
one
could
see
the
trail
to
the
depot
and
the
depot
itself
it
sure
her
he
announced
chip
driving
like
hell
and
the
smoke
uh
the
train
just
coming
around
the
bend
from
the
big
field
wonder
what
struck
her
so
sudden
he
turned
and
looked
down
into
the
grinning
face
of
andy
green
she
was
real
insulted
because
you
fellows
played
hookey
andy
explained
i
tried
to
explain
but
it
did
help
none
i
believe
her
heart
went
out
to
us
like
she
claimed
anyhow
happy
jack
wild
man
happy
jack
over
on
the
shonkin
range
saw
how
far
it
was
to
the
river
and
mopped
the
face
of
him
with
a
handkerchief
not
quite
as
clean
as
it
might
have
been
he
hoped
that
the
flying
u
wagons
would
be
where
he
had
estimated
that
they
would
be
for
he
was
aweary
of
riding
with
a
strange
outfit
where
his
little
personal
peculiarities
failed
to
meet
with
that
large
tolerance
accorded
by
the
happy
family
he
did
think
much
of
the
shonkin
crew
grangers
and
pilgrims
he
called
them
disgustedly
in
his
mind
he
hoped
the
old
man
would
not
send
him
on
that
long
trip
with
them
south
of
the
highwoods
which
is
what
he
was
on
his
way
to
find
out
about
what
happy
jack
was
hoping
for
was
to
have
the
old
man
as
represented
by
chip
send
one
of
the
boys
back
with
him
to
bring
over
what
flying
u
cattle
had
been
gathered
together
with
happy
bed
and
string
of
horses
then
he
would
ride
with
the
happy
family
on
the
familiar
range
that
was
better
in
his
eyes
than
any
other
range
that
ever
lay
outdoors
and
the
shonkin
outfit
could
go
to
granny
happy
did
not
however
say
granny
he
turned
down
the
head
of
a
coulee
which
promised
to
lead
him
by
the
most
direct
route
if
any
route
in
the
badlands
can
be
called
direct
to
the
river
across
which
and
a
few
miles
up
on
suction
creek
he
confidently
expected
to
find
the
flying
u
wagons
the
coulee
wound
aimlessly
with
precipitous
sides
that
he
could
not
climb
even
by
leading
his
horse
happy
jack
under
the
sweltering
heat
of
sunlight
once
more
mopped
his
face
now
more
crimson
than
ever
and
relapsed
into
his
habitual
gloom
just
when
he
was
telling
himself
pessimistically
that
the
chances
were
he
would
run
slap
out
on
a
cut
bank
where
he
could
get
down
to
the
river
at
all
the
coulee
turned
again
and
showed
the
water
slithering
coolly
past
with
the
far
bank
green
and
sloping
invitingly
the
horse
hurried
forward
at
a
shuffling
trot
and
thrust
his
hot
muzzle
into
the
delicious
coolness
happy
jack
slipped
off
and
lying
flat
on
his
stomach
from
the
horse
drank
deep
and
long
then
stood
up
wiped
his
face
and
considered
the
necessity
of
crossing
just
at
this
point
the
river
was
not
so
wide
as
in
others
and
for
that
reason
the
current
flowed
swiftly
past
not
too
swiftly
however
if
one
took
certain
precautions
happy
jack
measured
mentally
the
strength
of
the
current
and
the
proper
amount
of
caution
which
it
would
be
expedient
to
use
and
began
his
preparations
for
the
sun
was
sliding
down
hill
toward
the
western
skyline
and
he
wished
very
much
to
reach
the
wagons
in
time
for
supper
if
he
could
standing
in
the
shade
of
the
coulee
wall
he
undressed
deliberately
folding
each
garment
methodically
as
he
took
it
off
when
the
pile
was
complete
to
socks
and
boots
he
rolled
it
into
a
compact
bundle
and
tied
it
firmly
upon
his
saddle
stranger
his
horse
was
a
good
swimmer
and
always
swam
high
out
of
water
he
hoped
the
things
would
not
get
very
wet
still
the
current
was
strong
and
his
characteristic
pessimism
suggested
that
they
would
be
soaked
to
the
last
thread
so
naked
as
our
first
ancestor
he
urged
his
horse
into
the
stream
and
when
it
was
too
deep
for
kicking
stranger
was
ever
uncertain
and
not
to
be
trusted
too
far
he
caught
him
firmly
by
the
tail
and
felt
the
current
grip
them
both
the
feel
of
the
water
was
glorious
after
so
long
a
ride
in
the
hot
sun
and
happy
jack
reveled
in
the
cool
swash
of
it
up
his
shoulders
to
the
back
of
his
neck
as
stranger
swam
out
and
across
to
the
sloping
green
bank
on
the
home
side
when
his
feet
struck
bottom
happy
jack
should
have
waded
also
but
the
water
was
so
deliciously
cool
slapping
high
up
on
his
shoulders
like
that
he
still
floated
luxuriously
towed
by
stranger
until
stranger
his
footing
secure
glanced
back
at
happy
sliding
behind
like
a
big
red
fish
snorted
and
plunged
up
and
on
to
dry
land
happy
jack
struck
his
feet
down
to
bottom
stumbled
and
let
go
his
hold
of
the
tail
and
stranger
feeling
the
weight
loosen
suddenly
gave
another
plunge
and
went
careering
up
the
bank
snorting
back
at
happy
jack
happy
swore
waded
out
and
made
threats
but
stranger
seeing
himself
pursued
by
a
strange
figure
whose
only
resemblance
to
his
master
lay
in
voice
and
profanity
fled
in
terror
before
him
happy
jack
crippling
painfully
on
the
stones
fled
fruitlessly
after
still
shouting
threats
then
as
stranger
galloping
wildly
disappeared
over
a
ridge
he
stood
and
stared
stupidly
at
the
place
where
the
horse
had
last
been
seen
for
the
moment
his
mind
refused
to
grasp
all
the
horror
of
his
position
he
stepped
gingerly
over
the
hot
sand
and
rocks
sought
the
shelter
of
a
bit
of
overhanging
bank
and
sat
dazedly
down
upon
a
rock
too
warm
for
comfort
he
shifted
uneasily
to
the
sand
beside
found
that
still
hotter
and
returned
to
the
rock
he
needed
to
think
to
grasp
this
disaster
that
had
come
so
suddenly
upon
him
he
looked
moodily
across
to
the
southern
bank
his
chin
sunken
between
moist
palms
the
while
the
water
dried
upon
his
person
to
be
set
afoot
down
here
in
the
badlands
away
from
the
habitations
of
men
and
fifteen
miles
from
the
probable
location
of
the
flying
u
camp
was
not
nice
to
be
set
afoot
it
was
horrible
and
unbelievable
he
thought
of
tramping
barefooted
and
through
fifteen
miles
of
badlands
to
camp
with
the
sun
beating
down
on
his
unprotected
back
and
groaned
in
anticipation
not
even
his
pessimism
had
ever
pictured
a
thing
so
terrible
he
gazed
at
the
river
which
had
caused
this
trouble
that
he
must
face
and
forgetting
the
luxury
of
its
coolness
cursed
it
venomously
little
waves
washed
up
on
the
pebbly
bank
and
glinted
in
the
sun
while
they
whispered
mocking
things
to
him
happy
jack
gave
over
swearing
at
the
river
and
turned
his
wrath
upon
stranger
stranger
hurtling
along
somewhere
through
the
breaks
with
all
happy
clothes
tied
firmly
to
the
saddle
happy
jack
sighed
lugubriously
when
he
remembered
how
firmly
a
fleeting
hope
that
if
he
followed
the
trail
of
stranger
he
might
glean
a
garment
or
two
that
had
slipped
loose
died
almost
before
it
lived
happy
jack
knew
too
well
the
kind
of
knots
he
always
tied
his
favorite
boast
that
nothing
ever
worked
loose
on
his
saddle
came
back
now
to
mock
him
with
its
absolute
truth
the
sun
dropping
a
bit
lower
robbed
him
inch
by
inch
of
the
shade
to
which
he
clung
foolishly
he
hunched
himself
into
as
small
a
space
as
his
big
frame
would
permit
and
hung
his
hat
upon
his
knees
where
they
stuck
out
into
the
sunlight
it
was
very
hot
and
his
position
was
cramped
but
he
would
not
go
yet
he
was
still
thinking
and
the
brain
of
happy
jack
worked
ever
slowly
in
such
an
predicament
he
felt
dimly
that
he
had
need
of
much
thought
when
not
even
his
hat
could
shield
him
from
the
sun
glare
he
got
up
and
went
nipping
awkwardly
over
the
hot
beach
he
was
going
into
the
next
wherever
that
was
on
the
chance
of
finding
a
or
some
cabin
where
he
could
by
some
means
clothe
himself
he
did
not
like
the
idea
of
facing
the
happy
family
in
his
present
condition
he
knew
the
happy
family
perhaps
he
might
find
someone
living
down
here
next
the
river
he
hoped
so
for
happy
jack
when
things
were
so
bad
they
could
not
well
be
worse
was
forced
to
give
over
the
prediction
of
further
evil
and
pursue
blindly
the
faintest
whisper
of
hope
he
got
up
on
the
bank
where
the
grass
was
kinder
to
his
unaccustomed
feet
than
were
the
hot
stones
below
and
hurried
away
with
his
back
to
the
sun
that
scorched
him
cruelly
in
the
next
bottom
and
he
was
long
getting
to
it
the
sage
brush
grew
dishearteningly
thick
happy
began
to
be
afraid
of
snakes
he
went
slowly
stepping
painfully
where
the
ground
seemed
smoothest
he
never
could
walk
fifteen
miles
in
his
bare
feet
he
owned
dismally
to
himself
his
only
hope
lay
in
getting
clothes
halfway
down
the
bottom
he
joyfully
came
upon
a
camp
but
it
had
long
been
deserted
from
the
low
corrals
and
the
unmistakable
atmosphere
of
the
place
happy
jack
knew
it
for
a
sheep
camp
but
nothing
save
the
musty
odor
and
the
bare
cabin
walls
seemed
to
have
been
left
behind
he
searched
gloomily
thankful
for
the
brief
shade
the
cabin
offered
then
tossed
up
on
the
rafters
and
forgotten
he
discovered
a
couple
of
dried
sheep
pelts
untanned
and
stiff
almost
as
shingles
still
they
were
better
than
nothing
and
he
grinned
in
sickly
fashion
at
the
find
realizing
in
much
pain
that
some
protection
for
his
feet
was
an
absolute
necessity
he
tore
a
pelt
in
two
for
sandals
much
search
resulted
in
the
discovery
of
a
bit
of
rotted
rope
which
he
unraveled
and
thereby
bound
a
piece
of
sheepskin
upon
each
bruised
foot
they
were
not
pretty
but
they
answered
the
purpose
the
other
pelt
he
disposed
of
easily
by
tying
the
two
front
legs
together
around
his
neck
and
letting
the
pelt
hang
down
his
back
as
far
as
it
would
reach
there
being
nothing
more
that
he
could
do
in
the
way
of
happy
jack
went
out
again
into
the
hot
afternoon
at
his
best
happy
jack
could
never
truthfully
be
called
handsome
just
now
clothed
inadequately
in
gray
stetson
hat
and
two
meager
sheepskins
he
looked
scarce
human
cheered
a
bit
he
set
out
sturdily
over
the
hills
toward
the
mouth
of
suction
creek
the
happy
family
would
make
all
kinds
of
fools
of
themselves
he
supposed
if
he
showed
up
like
this
but
he
might
not
be
obliged
to
appear
before
them
in
his
present
state
of
undress
he
might
strike
some
other
camp
first
happy
jack
was
still
forced
to
be
hopeful
he
quite
counted
on
striking
another
camp
before
reaching
the
wagons
of
the
flying
u
the
sun
slid
farther
and
farther
toward
the
western
rim
of
tumbled
ridges
as
happy
jack
in
his
strange
raiment
plodded
laboriously
to
the
north
the
mantle
he
was
forced
to
shift
constantly
into
a
new
position
as
the
sun
rays
burned
deep
a
new
place
or
the
stiff
hide
galled
his
blistered
shoulders
the
sandals
did
better
except
that
the
rotten
strands
of
rope
were
continually
wearing
through
on
the
bottom
so
that
he
must
stop
and
tie
fresh
knots
or
replace
the
bit
from
the
scant
surplus
which
he
had
prudently
brought
along
till
sundown
he
climbed
toilfully
up
the
steep
hills
and
then
scrambled
as
toilfully
into
the
coulees
taking
the
straightest
course
he
knew
for
the
mouth
of
suction
creek
that
as
a
last
resort
while
he
watched
keenly
for
the
white
flake
against
green
which
would
tell
of
a
tent
pitched
there
in
the
wilderness
he
was
hungry
when
he
forgot
other
discomforts
long
enough
to
think
of
it
worst
perhaps
was
the
way
in
which
the
gaunt
sage
brush
scratched
his
unclothed
legs
when
he
was
compelled
to
cross
a
patch
on
some
coulee
bottom
happy
jack
swore
a
great
deal
in
those
long
hours
and
never
did
he
so
completely
belie
the
name
men
had
in
sarcasm
given
him
just
when
he
was
given
over
to
the
most
gloomy
forebodings
a
white
square
stood
out
for
a
moment
sharply
against
a
background
of
pines
far
below
him
in
a
coulee
where
the
sun
was
peering
fleetingly
before
it
dove
out
of
sight
over
a
hill
happy
jack
of
a
truth
the
most
unhappy
jack
one
could
find
though
he
searched
far
and
long
stood
still
and
eyed
the
white
patch
critically
there
was
only
the
one
but
another
might
be
hidden
in
the
trees
still
there
was
no
herd
grazing
anywhere
in
the
coulee
and
no
jingle
of
cavvy
bells
came
to
his
ears
though
he
listened
long
he
was
sure
that
it
was
not
the
camp
of
the
flying
u
where
he
would
be
ministered
unto
faithfully
to
be
sure
yet
where
the
ministrations
would
be
mingled
with
much
raillery
harder
even
to
bear
than
was
his
present
condition
of
and
scratches
he
thanked
the
lord
in
sincere
if
unorthodox
terms
and
went
down
the
hill
in
long
ungraceful
strides
it
was
far
down
that
hill
and
it
was
farther
across
the
coulee
each
step
grew
more
wearisome
to
happy
jack
unaccustomed
as
he
was
to
using
his
own
feet
as
a
mode
of
travel
but
away
in
the
edge
of
the
pine
grove
were
food
and
raiment
and
a
shelter
from
the
night
that
was
creeping
down
on
him
with
the
hurried
stealth
of
a
mountain
lion
after
its
quarry
he
shifted
the

mantle
for
the
thousandth
time
this
time
he
untied
it
from
his
galled

and
festooned
it

unbecomingly
about
his
middle
feeling
sure
of
the
unfailing
hospitality
of
the
rangeland
be
the

happy
jack
walked
boldly
through
the
soft
spring
twilight
that
lasts
long
in

and
up
to
the
very
door
of
the
tent
a
figure
a
female
figure
slender
and
topped
by
thin
face
and
eyes
sheltered
behind
glasses
rose
up
gazed
upon

in
horror
shrieked
till
one
could
hear
her
a
mile
and
fell
backward
into
the
tent
another
female
figure
appeared
looked
and
shrieked
also
and
even
louder
than
did
the
first
happy
jack
with
a
squawk
of
dismay
turned
and
flew
incontinently
afar
into
the
dusk
a
man
voice
he
heard
shouting
inquiry
another
shouting
what
from
a
distance
sounded
like
threats
happy
jack
did
not
wait
to
make
sure
he
ran
blindly
until
he
brought
up
in
a
patch
of
at
which
he
yelled
forgetting
for
the
instant
that
he
was
pursued
somehow
he
floundered
out
and
away
from
the
torture
of
the
stinging
spines
and
took
to
the
hills
a
moon
big
as
the
mouth
of
a
barrel
climbed
over
a
ridge
and
betrayed
him
to
the
men
searching
below
and
they
shouted
and
fired
a
gun
happy
jack
did
not
believe
they
could
shoot
very
straight
but
he
was
in
no
mood
to
take
chances
he
sought
refuge
among
a
jumble
of
great
gray
bowlders
sat
himself
down
in
the
shadow
and
caressed
gingerly
the
places
where
the
had
punctured
his
skin
and
gave
himself
riotously
over
to
blasphemy
the
men
below
were
prowling
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
they
were
afraid
of
running
upon
him
too
suddenly
it
came
to
him
that
they
were
afraid
of
him
and
he
grinned
feebly
at
the
joke
he
had
not
before
stopped
to
consider
his
appearance
being
concerned
with
more
important
matters
now
however
as
he
pulled
the
scant
covering
of
the
pelt
over
his
shoulders
to
keep
off
the
chill
of
the
night
he
could
not
wonder
that
the
woman
at
the
tent
had
fainted
happy
jack
suspected
shrewdly
that
he
could
in
that
rig
startle
almost
any
one
he
watched
the
coulee
wistfully
they
were
making
fires
down
there
below
him
great
revealing
bonfires
at
intervals
that
would
make
it
impossible
to
pass
their
line
unseen
he
could
not
doubt
that
some
one
was
in
the
shadows
with
a
gun
there
were
more
than
two
men
happy
jack
thought
that
there
must
be
at
least
four
or
five
he
would
have
liked
to
go
down
just
out
of
gun
range
and
shout
explanations
and
a
request
for
some
clothes
only
for
the
women
happy
was
always
ill
at
ease
in
the
presence
of
strange
women
and
he
felt
just
now
quite
unequal
to
the
ordeal
of
facing
those
two
he
sat
huddled
in
the
shadow
of
a
rock
and
wished
profanely
that
women
would
stay
at
home
and
not
go
camping
out
in
the
badlands
where
their
presence
was
distinctly
inappropriate
and
undesirable
if
the
men
down
there
were
alone
he
felt
sure
that
he
could
make
them
understand
seeing
they
were
not
alone
however
he
stayed
where
he
was
and
watched
the
fires
while
his
teeth
chattered
with
cold
and
his
stomach
ached
with
the
hunger
he
could
not
appease
till
daylight
he
sat
there
unhappily
and
watched
the
unwinking
challenge
of
the
flames
below
and
miserably
wished
himself
elsewhere
even
the
jibes
of
the
happy
family
would
be
endurable
so
long
as
he
had
the
comfort
afforded
by
the
flying
u
camp
but
that
was
miles
away
and
when
daylight
brought
warmth
and
returning
courage
he
went
so
far
as
to
wish
the
flying
u
camp
farther
away
than
it
probably
was
he
wanted
to
get
somewhere
and
ask
help
from
strangers
rather
than
those
he
knew
best
with
that
idea
fixed
in
his
mind
he
got
stiffly
to
his
bruised
feet
readjusted
the
sheepskin
and
began
wearily
to
climb
higher
when
the
sun
tinged
all
the
hilltops
golden
yellow
he
turned
and
shook
his
fist
impotently
at
the
camp
far
beneath
him
then
he
went
on
doggedly
standing
at
last
on
a
high
peak
he
looked
away
toward
the
sunrise
and
made
out
a
white
speck
on
a
grassy
beside
it
a
gray
square
moved
slowly
over
the
green
sheep
and
a
sheep
camp
and
happy
jack
hater
of
sheep
though
he
was
hailed
the
sight
as
a
bit
of
rare
good
luck
his
spirits
rose
immediately
and
he
started
straight
for
the
place
down
in
the
next
coulee
there
were
always
coulees
to
cross
no
matter
in
what
direction
one
would
travel
he
came
near
running
plump
into
three
riders
who
were
irish
mallory
and
weary
and
pink
they
were
riding
down
from
the
direction
of
the
camp
where
were
the
women
and
they
caught
sight
of
him
immediately
and
gave
chase
happy
jack
had
no
mind
to
be
rounded
up
by
that
trio
he
dodged
into
the
bushes
and
though
they
dug
long
unmerciful
scratches
in
his
person
clung
to
the
shelter
they
gave
and
made
off
at
top
speed
he
could
hear
the
others
shouting
at
one
another
as
they
galloped
here
and
there
trying
to
locate
him
and
he
skulked
where
the
bushes
were
deepest
like
a
criminal
in
fear
of
lynching
luck
for
once
was
with
him
and
he
got
out
into
another
coulee
without
being
seen
and
felt
himself
for
the
present
safe
from
that
portion
of
the
happy
family
thereafter
he
avoided
religiously
the
higher
ridges
and
kept
the
direction
more
by
instinct
than
by
actual
knowledge
the
sun
grew
hot
again
and
he
hurried
on
shifting
the
sheepskin
as
the
need
impressed
when
at
last
he
sighted
again
the
sheep
they
were
very
close
happy
jack
grew
cautious
he
crept
down
upon
the
unsuspecting
herder
as
stealthily
as
an
animal
hunting
its
breakfast
herders
sometimes
carry
guns
and
the
experience
of
last
night
burned
hot
in
his
memory
slipping
warily
from
rock
to
rock
he
was
within
a
dozen
feet
when
a
dog
barked
and
betrayed
his
presence
the
herder
did
not
have
a
gun
he
gave
a
yell
of
pure
terror
and
started
for
camp
after
his
weapon
happy
jack
yelling
also
with
long
leaps
followed
after
twice
the
herder
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
the
weird
figure
in
gray
hat
and
flapping
sheepskin
and
immediately
after
each
glance
his
pace
increased
perceptibly
still
happy
jack
desperate
beyond
measure
doggedly
pursued
and
his
long
legs
lessened
at
each
jump
the
distance
between
from
a
spectacular
viewpoint
it
must
have
been
a
pretty
race
the
herder
with
a
gasp
dove
into
the
tent
into
the
tent
happy
jack
dove
after
him
and
none
too
soon
the
hand
of
the
herder
had
almost
clasped
his
rifle
when
the
weight
of
happy
bore
him
shrieking
to
the
earthen
floor
aw
yuh
locoed
old
fool
shut
up
ca
yuh
a
minute
happy
jack
with
his
fingers
pressed
against
the
windpipe
of
the
other
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
his
request
granted
at
once
the
shrieks
died
to
mere
gurgling

want

i
ai
going
eat
yuh
not
unless
you
too
slow
with
that
grub
the
herder
was
submissive
and
placating
and
permitted
happy
jack
to
appropriate
the
conventional
garb
of
a
male
human
the
while
coffee
and
bacon
were
maddening
his
hunger
with
their
tantalizing
odor
he
seemed
much
more
at
ease
once
he
saw
that
happy
jack
properly
clothed
was
not
particularly
fearsome
to
look
upon
and
talked
volubly
while
he
got
out
bread
and
stewed
prunes
and
boiled
beans
for
the
guest
happy
jack
clothed
and
fed
became
himself
again
and
prophesied
gloomily
the
chances
is
that
horse
uh
mine
be
forty
miles
away
and
still
going
by
this
time
but
soon
as
i
can
round
him
up
bring
your
pinto
back
yuh
need
t
worry
none
i
guess
i
got
all
the
sense
i
ever
had
once
more
astride
a
horse
albeit
the
pinto
pony
of
a
sheepherder
happy
jack
felt
abundantly
able
to
cope
with
the
situation
he
made
a
detour
that
put
him
far
from
where
the
three
he
most
dreaded
to
meet
were
apt
to
be
and
struck
out
at
the
best
pace
for
the
river
at
the
point
where
he
had
crossed
so
disastrously
the
day
before
having
a
good
memory
for
directions
and
localities
he
easily
found
the
place
of
unhappy
memory
and
taking
up
stranger
trail
through
the
sand
from
there
he
got
the
general
direction
of
his
flight
and
followed
vengefully
after
rode
for
an
hour
up
a
long
grassy
coulee
and
came
suddenly
upon
the
fugitive
feeding
quietly
beside
a
spring
the
bundle
of
clothing
was
still
tied
firmly
to
the
saddle
and
at
sight
of
it
the
face
of
happy
jack
relaxed
somewhat
from
its
gloom
when
happy
rode
up
and
cast
a
loop
over
his
head
stranger
nickered
a
bit
as
if
he
did
not
much
enjoy
freedom
while
he
yet
bore
the
trappings
of
servitude
and
his
submission
was
so
instant
and
voluntary
that
happy
jack
had
not
the
heart
to
do
as
he
had
threatened
many
times
in
the
last
few
hours
to
beat
the
hide
off
him
instead
he
got
hastily
into
his
clothes
quite
as
if
he
feared
they
might
again
be
whisked
away
from
him
and
then
rubbed
forgivingly
the
nose
of
stranger
and
solicitously
pulled
a
few
strands
of
his
forelock
from
under
the
in
the
heart
of
happy
jack
was
a
great
peace
marred
only
by
the
physical
discomforts
of
much
and
many
deep
scratches
after
that
he
got
thankfully
into
his
own
saddle
and
rode
gladly
away
leading
the
pinto
pony
behind
him
he
had
got
out
of
the
scrape
and
the
happy
family
would
never
find
it
out
it
was
not
likely
that
they
would
chance
upon
the
swede
herder
or
if
they
did
that
they
would
exchange
with
him
many
words
the
happy
family
held
itself
physically
mentally
morally
and
socially
far
above
sheepherders
and
in
that
lay
the
safety
of
happy
jack
it
was
nearly
noon
when
he
reached
again
the
sheep
camp
and
the
swede
hospitably
urged
him
to
stay
and
eat
with
him
but
happy
jack
would
not
tarry
for
he
was
anxious
to
reach
the
camp
of
the
flying
u
a
mile
from
the
herder
camp
he
saw
again
on
a
distant
hilltop
three
familiar
figures
this
time
he
did
not
dodge
into
shelter
but
urged
stranger
to
a
gallop
and
rode
boldly
toward
them
they
greeted
him
joyfully
and
at
the
top
of
their
voices
when
he
came
within
shouting
distance
how
comes
it
you
riding
the
pinnacles
over
here
weary
wanted
to
know
as
soon
as
he
rode
alongside
aw
i
just
came
over
after
more
orders
hope
they
send
somebody
else
over
there
if
they
want
any
more
repping
done
happy
jack
said
in
his
customary
tone
of
discontent
with
circumstances
say
yuh
did
see
anything
of
a
wild
man
down
next
the
river
did
yuh
put
in
pink
aw
gwan
what
wild
man
happy
jack
eyed
them
suspiciously
honest
there
a
wild
man
ranging
around
here
in
these
hills
pink
declared
we
been
mooching
around
all
forenoon
hunting
him
got
sight
of
him
early
this
morning
but
he
got
away
in
the
brush
happy
jack
looked
guilty
and
even
more
suspicious
was
it
possible
that
they
had
recognized
him
the
way
we
come
to
hear
about
him
weary
explained
we
happened
across
some
campers
over
in
a
little
coulee
to
the
west
uh
here
they
was
all
worked
up
over
him
seems
he
went
into
camp
last
night
and
like
to
scared
the
ladies
into
fits
he
ai
got
enough
clothes
on
to
flag
an
antelope
according
to
them
and
he
about
seven
feet
high
and
looks
more
like
a
missing
link
than
a
plain
ordinary
man
the
one
that
did
faint
away
got
the
best
look
at
him
and
she
ready
to
take
oath
he
ai
half
human
they
kept
fires
burning
all
night
to
scare
him
out
uh
the
coulee
and
they
going
to
break
camp
and
hike
for
home
they
say
he
give
a
screech
that
put
a
crimp
in
the
devil
himself
and
went
galloping
off
jumping
about
twenty
feet
at
a
lick
and
aw
gwan
protested
happy
jack
feebly
so
help
me
josephine
it
the
truth
abetted
pink
and
unmistakably
in
earnest
we
would
uh
taken
much
stock
in
it
either
only
we
saw
him
ourselves
not
more
than
two
hundred
yards
off
he
was
just
over
the
hill
from
the
coulee
where
they
were
camped
so
it
bound
to
be
the
same
animal
it
a
fact
he
did
have
much
covering
just
something
hung
over
his
shoulders
and
he
was
sure
wild
for
soon
as
he
seen
us
he
humped
himself
and
got
into
the
brush
we
could
hear
him
go
crashing
away
like
a
whole
bunch
of
elephants
it
a
damn
shame
he
got
away
on
us
pink
sighed
regretfully
we
was
going
to
rope
him
and
put
him
in
a
cage
we
could
sure
uh
made
money
on
him
at
two
bits
a
look
happy
jack
continued
to
eye
the
three
distrustfully
too
often
had
he
been
the
victim
of
their
humor
for
him
now
to
believe
implicitly
in
their
ignorance
it
was
too
good
to
be
real
it
seemed
to
him
still
if
by
any
good
luck
it
real
he
hated
to
think
what
would
happen
if
they
ever
found
out
the
truth
he
eased
the
clothing
cautiously
away
from
his
smarting
back
and
stared
hard
into
a
coulee
it
was
likely
some
sheepherder
gone
clean
nutty
mused
irish
well
the
most
uh
them
would
have
far
to
go
ventured
happy
jack
thinking
of
the
swede
what
we
ought
to
do
said
pink
keen
for
the
chase
is
for
the
whole
bunch
of
us
to
come
down
here
and
round
him
up
wonder
if
we
could
talk
chip
into
laying
off
for
a
day
or
so
there
no
herd
to
hold
i
sure
would
like
to
get
a
good
look
at
him
somebody
ought
to
take
him
in
observed
irish
longingly
he
safe
running
around
loose
like
that
there
no
telling
what
he
might
do
the
way
them
campers
read
his
brand
he
plumb
dangerous
to
meet
up
with
alone
it
lucky
you
did
run
onto
him
happy
well
i
did
growled
happy
jack
and
what
more
i
betche
there
ai
any
such
person
do
call
us
liars
to
our
faces
happy
weary
reproved
we
told
yuh
a
dozen
times
that
we
saw
him
ourselves
yuh
might
be
polite
enough
to
take
our
word
for
it
aw
gwan
happy
jack
grunted
still
not
quite
sure
of
how
much
or
how
little
they
knew
while
they
discussed
further
the
wild
man
he
watched
furtively
for
the
surreptitious
lowering
of
lids
that
would
betray
their
insincerity
when
they
appealed
to
him
for
an
opinion
of
some
phase
of
the
subject
he
answered
with
caution
he
tried
to
turn
the
talk
to
his
experiences
on
the
shonkin
range
and
found
the
wild
man
cropping
up
with
disheartening
persistency
he
shifted
often
in
the
saddle
because
of
the
deep
sunburns
which
smarted
continually
and
maddeningly
he
wondered
if
the
boys
had
used
all
of
that
big
box
of
carbolic
salve
which
used
to
be
kept
in
a
corner
of
the
and
was
carbolic
salve
good
for
he
told
himself
gloomily
that
if
there
was
any
of
it
left
and
if
it
were
good
for
his
ailment
there
would
be
half
enough
of
it
anyway
he
estimated
unhappily
that
he
would
need
about
two
quarts
when
they
reached
camp
the
welcome
of
happy
jack
was
overshadowed
and
made
insignificant
by
the
strange
story
of
the
wild
man
happy
jack
mentally
and
physically
miserable
was
forced
to
hear
it
all
told
over
again
and
to
listen
to
the
excited
comments
of
the
others
he
was
sick
of
the
subject
he
had
heard
enough
about
the
wild
man
and
he
wished
fervently
that
they
would
shut
up
about
it
he
could
see
that
it
was
anything
to
make
such
a
fuss
about
anyway
and
he
wished
he
could
get
his
hands
on
that
carbolic
salve
without
having
the
whole
bunch
rubbering
around
and
asking
questions
about
something
that
was
none
of
their
business
he
even
wished
in
that
first
bitter
hour
after
he
had
eaten
and
while
they
were
lying
idly
in
the
shady
spots
that
he
was
back
on
the
shonkin
range
with
an
alien
crew
it
was
perhaps
an
hour
later
that
pink
always
of
an
investigative
turn
of
mind
came
slipping
quietly
up
through
the
rose
bushes
from
the
creek
the
happy
family
lying
luxuriously
upon
the
grass
were
still
discussing
the
latest
excitement
pink
watched
his
chance
and
when
none
but
weary
observed
him
jerked
his
head
mysteriously
toward
the
creek
weary
got
up
yawned
ostentatiously
and
sauntered
away
in
the
wake
of
pink
what
the
matter
cadwolloper
he
asked
when
he
was
close
enough
seen
a
garter
snake
pink
was
notoriously
afraid
of
snakes
you
come
with
me
and
i
show
yuh
the
wild
man
he
grinned
mama
ejaculated
weary
and
followed
stealthily
where
pink
led
some
distance
up
the
creek
pink
signalled
caution
and
they
crept
like
indians
on
hands
and
knees
through
the
grass
on
the
edge
of
the
high
bank
they
stopped
and
pink
motioned
weary
looked
over
and
came
near
whooping
at
the
sight
below
he
gazed
a
minute
drew
back
and
put
his
face
close
to
the
face
of
pink
cadwolloper
go
get
the
bunch
he
commanded
in
a
whisper
and
pink
again
signalling
needlessly
for
silence
slipped
hastily
away
from
the
spot
happy
jack
secure
in
the
seclusion
offered
by
the
high
bank
of
the
creek
ran
his
finger
regretfully
around
the
inside
of
the
carbolic
salve
box
eyed
the
result
dissatisfiedly
and
applied
the
finger
carefully
to
a
deep
cut
on
his
knee
he
had
got
that
cut
while
going
up
the
bluff
just
after
leaving
the
tent
where
had
been
the
shrieking
females
he
wished
there
was
more
salve
and
he
picked
up
the
cover
of
the
box
and
painstakingly
wiped
out
the
inside
the
result
was
disheartening
he
examined
his
knee
dolefully
it
was
beginning
to
look
inflamed
and
it
was
going
to
make
him
limp
he
wondered
if
the
boys
would
notice
anything
queer
about
his
walk
if
they
did
there
was
the
conventional
excuse
that
his
horse
had
fallen
down
with
him
happy
jack
hoped
that
it
would
be
convincing
he
took
up
the
box
again
and
looked
at
the
shining
emptiness
of
it
it
had
been
half
full
not
enough
by
a
long
way
and
maybe
some
one
would
wonder
what
had
become
of
it
darn
a
bunch
that
always
had
to
know
everything
anyway
happy
jack
warned
at
last
by
that
unnamed
instinct
which
tells
of
a
presence
unseen
turned
around
and
looked
up
apprehensively
the
happy
family
sitting
in
a
row
upon
their
heels
on
the
bank
looked
down
at
him
gravely
and
appreciatively
there
a
can
uh
wagon
dope
up
at
camp
cal
emmett
informed
him
sympathetically
aw
happy
jack
began
and
choked
upon
his
humiliation
i
used
to
know
a
piece
uh
poetry
about
a
fellow
like
happy
weary
remarked
sweetly
it
said
raised
his
veil
the
maid
turned
slowly
at
him
shrieked
and
fell
upon
the
ground
only
in
this
case
weary
smiled
blandly
down
upon
him
happy
have
no
veil
aw
gwan
adjured
happy
jack
helplessly
and
reached
for
his
clothes
while
the
happy
family
chorused
a
demand
for
explanations
a
tamer
of
wild
ones
when
the
days
grow
crisp
at
each
end
and
languorous
in
the
middle
when
a
haze
ripples
the
skyline
like
a
waving
ribbon
of
faded
blue
when
the
winds
and
the
grasses
stop
and
listen
for
the
first
of
winter
then
it
is
that
the
rangeland
takes
on
a
certain
intoxicating
unreality
and
blood
leaps
with
desire
to
do
something
anything
so
it
is
different
and
irresponsible
and
not
measured
by
precedent
or
prudence
in
days
like
that
one
grows
venturesome
and
ignores
difficulties
and
limitations
with
a
fine
disregard
for
probable
consequences
a
mental
snapping
of
fingers
on
a
day
like
that
the
happy
family
riding
together
out
of
dry
lake
with
the
latest
news
in
mind
and
speech
urged
andy
green
tamer
of
wild
ones
to
enter
the
contest
exploited
as
one
of
the
features
of
the
northern
montana
fair
to
be
held
at
great
falls
in
two
weeks
pink
could
not
enter
because
a
horse
had
fallen
with
him
and
hurt
his
leg
so
that
he
was
picking
the
gentlest
in
his
string
for
daily
riding
weary
would
not
because
he
had
promised
his
little
to
take
care
of
himself
and
not
take
any
useless
risks
even
the
temptation
of
a
purse
could
not
persuade
him
that
a
contest
is
perfectly
safe
and
without
the
ban
but
andy
impelled
by
the
leaping
blood
of
him
and
urged
by
the
loyal
family
consented
and
said
he
try
it
a
whirl
anyway
they
had
only
ridden
four
or
five
miles
when
the
decision
was
reached
and
they
straightway
turned
back
and
raced
into
dry
lake
again
so
that
andy
might
write
the
letter
that
clinched
matters
then
whooping
with
the
sheer
exhilaration
of
living
and
the
exultation
of
being
able
to
ride
and
whoop
unhindered
they
galloped
back
to
camp
and
let
the
news
spread
as
it
would
in
a
week
all
chouteau
county
knew
that
andy
green
would
ride
for
the
purse
and
nearly
all
chouteau
county
backed
him
with
all
the
money
it
could
command
certainly
all
of
it
that
knew
andy
green
and
had
seen
him
ride
made
haste
to
find
someone
who
did
not
know
him
and
whose
faith
in
another
contestant
was
strong
and
to
bet
all
the
money
it
could
lay
hands
upon
for
andy
was
one
of
those
men
whose
genius
runs
to
riding
horses
which
object
violently
to
being
ridden
one
of
those
lucky
fellows
who
never
seems
to
get
his
neck
broken
however
much
he
may
jeopardize
it
and
moreover
he
was
that
rare
genius
who
can
make
a
pretty
ride
where
other
resemble
nothing
so
much
as
a
scarecrow
in
a
cyclone
andy
not
only
could
ride
he
could
ride
gracefully
and
the
reason
for
that
not
many
knew
andy
in
the
years
before
he
wandered
to
the
range
had
danced
in
spangled
tights
upon
the
broad
rump
of
a
big
gray
horse
which
galloped
around
a
ring
with
the
regularity
of
movement
that
suggested
a
machine
while
a
man
in
the
center
cracked
a
whip
and
yelped
commands
andy
had
jumped
through
blazing
hoops
and
over
sagging
bunting
while
he
rode
and
he
was
just
a
trifle
ashamed
of
the
fact
also
though
it
does
not
particularly
matter
he
had
later
in
the
performance
gone
hurtling
around
the
big
tent
dressed
in
the
garb
of
an
ancient
roman
and
driving
four
bays
abreast
as
has
been
explained
he
never
boasted
of
his
circus
experience
though
his
days
in
spangled
tights
probably
had
much
to
do
with
the
inimitable
grace
of
him
in
the
saddle
the
happy
family
felt
to
a
man
that
andy
would
win
the
purse
and
add
honor
to
the
flying
u
in
the
winning
they
were
enthusiastic
over
the
prospect
and
willing
to
bet
all
they
had
on
the
outcome
the
happy
family
together
with
the
aliens
who
swelled
the
crew
to
size
was
foregathered
at
the
largest
flying
u
corral
watching
a
bunch
of
newly
bought
horses
circle
with
much
snorting
and
kicking
up
of
dust
inside
the
fence
it
was
the
interval
between
and
the
witchery
of
indian
summer
held
the
in
thrall
andy
sizing
up
the
bunch
and
the
brands
lighted
upon
a
rangy
blue
roan
that
he
knew
or
thought
he
knew
and
the
eyes
of
him
brightened
with
desire
if
he
could
get
that
roan
in
his
string
he
told
himself
he
could
go
to
sleep
in
the
saddle
on
for
an
easier
horse
to
ride
he
never
had
straddled
it
was
like
sitting
in
grandma
pet
rocking
chair
when
that
roan
loosened
his
muscles
for
a
long
tireless
gallop
over
the
prairie
sod
and
as
a
stayer
andy
had
never
seen
his
equal
it
was
not
his
turn
to
choose
however
and
he
held
his
breath
lest
the
rope
of
another
should
settle
over
the
ears
ahead
of
him
cal
emmett
roped
a
plump
little
black
and
led
him
out
grinning
satisfaction
from
the
white
back
of
the
withers
he
knew
him
for
a
broke
horse
and
he
certainly
was
pretty
to
look
at
andy
gave
him
but
a
fleeting
glance
happy
jack
spread
his
loop
and
climbed
down
from
the
fence
almost
at
andy
elbow
it
was
his
turn
to
choose
i
betche
that
there
blue
roan
over
there
is
a
good
one
he
remarked
i
going
to
tackle
him
andy
took
his
cigarette
from
between
his
lips
yuh
better
hobble
your
stirrups
then
he
discouraged
artfully
i
know
that
roan
a
heap
better
than
you
do
aw
gwan
happy
nevertheless
hesitated
he
got
a
kind
eye
in
his
head
yuh
can
always
go
by
a
horse
eye
can
yuh
andy
smiled
indifferently
go
after
him
then
and
say
happy
if
yuh
ride
that
blue
roan
for
five
successive
minutes
give
yuh
fifty
dollars
i
knew
that
hoss
down
on
the
musselshell
got
a
record
that
reach
from
here
to
dry
lake
and
back
it
was
a
bluff
pure
and
simple
born
of
his
covetousness
but
it
had
the
desired
effect
or
nearly
so
happy
fumbled
his
rope
and
eyed
the
roan
aw
i
betche
you
just
lying
he
hazarded
but
like
many
another
when
he
did
strike
the
truth
he
failed
to
recognize
it
i
betche
all
right
rope
him
out
and
climb
on
if
yuh
do
believe
me
the
tone
of
andy
was
tinged
with
injury
there
fifty
dollars
yes
by
gracious
i
give
yuh
a
dollars
if
yuh
ride
him
for
five
minutes
straight
a
conversation
of
that
character
carried
on
near
the
top
of
two
voices
never
fails
in
the
range
land
to
bring
an
audience
of
every
male
human
within
hearing
all
other
conversations
and
interests
were
immediately
suspended
and
a
dozen
men
trotted
up
to
see
what
it
was
all
about
andy
remained
roosting
upon
the
top
rail
his
rope
coiled
loosely
and
dangling
from
one
arm
while
he
smoked
imperturbably
oh
happy
was
going
to
rope
out
a
bad
one
for
his
night
hoss
and
out
uh
the
goodness
uh
my
heart
i
put
him
wise
to
what
he
was
going
up
against
he
explained
carelessly
he
acts
like
he
has
some
thoughts
uh
doubting
my
word
so
i
just
offered
him
a
hundred
dollars
to
ride
him
that
blue
roan
over
there
next
that
crooked
post
a
reserved
seat
right
in
front
of
the
grand
stand
where
all
the
big
acts
place
he
sung
out
suddenly
in
the
regulation
circus
tone
go
on
happy
do
keep
the
audience
waiting
are
yuh
going
to
earn
that
hundred
dollars
happy
jack
turned
half
a
shade
redder
than
was
natural
aw
gwan
i
never
said
i
was
going
to
do
no
ack
but
i
betche
yuh
never
seen
that
roan
before
he
was
unloaded
in
dry
lake
what
yuh
bet
i
do
know
that
hoss
from
a
yearling
colt
andy
challenged
and
happy
jack
walked
away
without
replying
and
cast
his
loop
sullenly
over
the
first
horse
he
came
to
which
was
the
roan
chip
coming
up
to
hear
the
last
of
it
turned
and
looked
long
at
the
horse
in
question
a
horse
standing
by
a
crooked
corral
post
and
flicking
his
ears
at
the
flies
do
you
know
that
roan
he
asked
andy
in
the
tone
which
brings
truthful
answer
andy
had
one
good
point
he
never
lied
except
in
an
irresponsible
mood
of
pure
deviltry
for
instance
he
never
had
lied
seriously
to
an
employer
sure
i
know
that
hoss
he
answered
truthfully
did
you
ever
ride
him
no
andy
admitted
still
truthfully
i
never
rode
him
but
once
myself
but
i
worked
right
with
a
lazy
rep
that
had
him
in
his
string
down
at
the
u
two
years
ago
i
know
the
hoss
all
right
but
i
did
lie
when
i
told
happy
i
knowed
him
from
a
colt
i
spread
it
on
a
little
bit
thick
there
he
smiled
engagingly
down
at
chip
and
he
a
bad
one
is
he
chip
queried
over
his
shoulder
just
as
he
was
about
to
walk
away
well
andy
prevaricated
still
clinging
to
the
letter
if
not
to
the
spirit
of
truth
he
ai
a
hoss
i
like
to
see
happy
jack
go
up
against
i
ai
saying
though
that
he
ca
be
i
do
say
that
about
hoss
is
he
any
worse
than
glory
when
glory
is
feeling
peevish
weary
asked
when
chip
was
gone
and
while
the
men
still
lingered
andy
glancing
to
make
sure
that
chip
was
out
of
hearing
threw
away
his
cigarette
and
yielded
to
temptation
glory
he
snorted
with
a
fine
contempt
why
glory
a
beside
that
blue
roan
why
that
hoss
throwed
buckskin
jimmy
clean
out
of
a
corral
did
yuh
ever
see
buckskin
jimmy
ride
well
say
yuh
missed
a
pretty
sight
then
jimmy
a
rider
about
the
only
animal
he
ever
failed
to
connect
with
for
keeps
is
that
same
hoss
yuh
see
over
there
happy
says
he
got
a
kind
eye
in
his
head
andy
stopped
and
laughed
till
they
all
laughed
with
him
by
gracious
happy
ought
to
step
up
him
once
and
see
how
he
is
he
laughed
again
until
happy
across
the
corral
saddling
the
horse
he
had
chosen
muttered
profanely
at
the
derision
he
knew
was
pointed
at
himself
why
i
seen
that
hoss
andy
green
once
fairly
started
in
the
fascinating
path
of
romance
invented
details
for
the
pure
joy
of
creation
if
he
had
written
some
of
the
tales
he
told
and
had
sold
the
writing
for
many
dollars
he
would
have
been
famous
since
he
did
not
write
them
for
profit
but
told
them
for
fun
instead
he
earned
merely
the
reputation
of
being
a
great
liar
a
significant
mark
of
his
genius
lay
in
the
fact
that
his
inventions
never
failed
to
convince
not
till
afterward
did
his
audience
doubt
that
is
why
the
blue
roan
was
not
chosen
in
any
of
the
strings
but
was
left
always
circling
in
the
corral
after
a
loop
had
settled
that
is
why
the
flying
u
boys
looked
at
him
askance
as
they
passed
him
by
that
is
why
when
a
certain
coleman
sent
by
the
board
of
directors
to
rake
northern
montana
for
bad
horses
looked
with
favor
upon
the
blue
roan
when
he
came
to
the
flying
u
ranch
and
heard
the
tale
of
his
exploits
as
interpreted
i
should
say
created
by
andy
green
we
got
to
have
him
he
declared
enthusiastically
if
he
as
bad
as
all
that
he
be
the
star
performer
at
the
contest
and
make
that
plum
a
hard
one
to
pick
some
of
these
gay
boys
have
entered
with
the
erroneous
idea
that
that
same
plum
is
hanging
loose
and
all
they
got
to
do
is
lean
up
against
the
tree
and
drop
in
their
mouths
we
got
to
have
that
roan
i
pay
you
a
good
price
for
him
whitmore
if
you
wo
let
him
go
any
other
way
got
a
reporter
up
there
that
can
do
him
up
brown
in
a
special
article
and
people
will
come
in
bunches
to
see
a
horse
with
that
kind
of
a
pedigree
is
it
green
here
that
knows
the
horse
and
what
he
do
you
sure
of
him
are
you
green
andy
took
time
to
roll
a
cigarette
he
had
not
expected
any
such
development
as
this
and
he
needed
to
think
of
the
best
way
out
all
he
had
wanted
or
intended
was
to
discourage
the
others
from
claiming
the
blue
roan
he
wanted
him
in
his
own
string
afterwards
when
they
had
pestered
him
about
the
roan
record
he
admitted
to
himself
that
he
had
maybe
overshot
the
mark
and
told
it
a
bit
too
scarey
and
too
convincingly
under
the
spell
of
fancy
he
had
done
more
than
make
the
roan
unpopular
as
a
roundup
horse
he
had
made
him
a
celebrity
in
the
way
of
outlaw
horses
and
they
wanted
him
in
the
contest
andy
perhaps
had
never
before
been
placed
in
just
such
a
position
are
you
sure
of
what
the
horse
will
do
coleman
repeated
seeing
that
andy
was
taking
a
long
time
to
reply
andy
licked
his
cigarette
twisted
an
end
and
leaned
backward
while
he
felt
in
his
pocket
for
a
match
from
the
look
of
his
face
you
never
could
have
told
how
very
uncomfortable
he
felt
naw
he
drawled
i
ai
never
sure
of
what
hoss
will
do
i
had
too
much
dealings
with
for
any
uh
that
brand
uh
foolishness
he
lighted
the
cigarette
as
if
that
were
the
only
matter
in
which
he
took
any
real
interest
though
he
was
thinking
fast
coleman
looked
nonplussed
but
i
thought
you
said
what
i
said
andy
retorted
evenly
hit
the
blue
roan
two
years
ago
maybe
he
reformed
since
then
i
dunno
nobody
rode
him
here
he
could
not
resist
a
sidelong
glance
at
happy
jack
there
was
some
talk
of
it
but
it
never
come
to
a
head
yuh
offered
me
a
hundred
dollars
happy
jack
began
accusingly
and
yuh
never
made
no
move
to
earn
it
that
i
know
of
by
gracious
yuh
all
seem
to
think
i
ought
to
that
hoss
i
ai
seen
him
for
two
years
maybe
so
he
a
real
wolf
yet
maybe
so
he
a
sheep
he
threw
out
both
his
hands
to
point
the
end
of
the
argument
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
stuck
them
deep
into
his
trousers
pockets
and
walked
away
before
he
could
be
betrayed
into
deeper
deceit
it
did
seem
to
him
rather
hard
that
merely
because
he
had
wanted
the
roan
badly
enough
to
er
exercise
a
little
diplomacy
in
order
to
get
him
they
should
keep
harping
on
the
subject
like
that
and
to
have
coleman
making
medicine
to
get
the
roan
into
that
contest
was
to
say
the
least
sickening
andy
private
belief
was
that
a
girl
could
go
round
up
the
on
that
horse
he
had
never
known
him
to
make
a
crooked
move
and
he
had
ridden
beside
him
all
one
summer
and
had
seen
him
in
all
places
and
under
all
possible
conditions
he
was
a
dandy
and
dead
gentle
all
this
talk
made
him
tired
andy
had
forgotten
that
he
himself
had
started
the
talk
coleman
went
often
to
the
corral
when
the
horses
were
in
and
looked
at
the
blue
roan
later
he
rode
on
to
other
ranches
where
he
had
heard
were
bad
horses
and
left
the
roan
for
further
consideration
when
he
was
gone
andy
breathed
freer
and
put
his
mind
to
the
coming
contest
and
the
things
he
meant
to
do
with
the
purse
and
with
the
other
contestants
that
diamond
g
twister

going
t
ride
happy

announced
one
day
when

simply

laughed
derisively
and
went
away
whistling
i
wish
i
was
as
sure
uh
living
till
i
was
a
thousand
years
old
and
able
to
ride
nine
months
out
of
every
year
of
he
called
back
to
happy
then
he
took
up
the
tune
where
he
had
left
off
for
the
days
were
still
crisp
at
both
ends
and
languorous
in
the
middle
and
wind
and
grasses
hushed
and
listened
for
the
coming
of
winter
and
because
of
these
things
and
his
youth
and
his
health
the
heart
of
andy
green
was
light
in
his
chest
and
trouble
stood
afar
off
with
its
face
turned
from
him
it
was
but
three
days
to
the
opening
of
the
fair
when
coleman
returning
that
way
from
his
search
for
bad
horses
clattered
with
his
gleanings
and
three
or
four
men
to
help
drive
them
down
the
grade
to
the
flying
u
and
in
the
flying
u
coulee
just
across
the
creek
from
the
corrals
still
rested
the
roundup
tents
for
a
space
for
the
shipping
was
over
early
and
work
was
not
urgent
and
chip
and
the
old
man
in
their
enthusiasm
for
the
contest
and
the
entry
of
their
own
man
had
decided
to
take
the
wagons
and
crew
entire
to
great
falls
and
camp
throughout
the
four
days
of
the
fair
the
boys
all
wanted
to
go
anyway
as
did
everybody
else
so
that
nothing
could
be
done
till
it
was
over
it
was
a
novel
idea
and
it
tickled
the
humor
of
the
happy
family
the
rough
string
as
the
bad
horses
were
called
was
corralled
and
the
men
made
merry
with
the
roundup
crew
diamond
g
men
they
were
loudly
proclaiming
their
faith
in
billy
roberts
and
offering
bets
already
against
andy
who
listened
undisturbed
and
had
very
little
to
say
the
happy
family
had
faith
in
him
and
that
was
enough
if
everybody
he
told
them
believed
that
he
would
win
where
would
be
the
fun
of
riding
and
showing
them
it
was
after
their
early
supper
that
coleman
came
down
to
camp
at
the
heels
of
chip
and
the
old
man
straightway
he
sought
out
andy
like
a
man
who
has
something
on
his
mind
though
andy
did
not
in
the
least
know
what
it
was
he
recognized
the
indefinable
symptoms
and
braced
himself
mentally
half
suspecting
that
it
was
something
about
that
blue
roan
again
he
was
getting
a
little
bit
tired
of
the
blue
roan
enough
so
that
though
he
had
chosen
him
for
his
string
he
had
not
yet
put
saddle
to
his
back
but
waited
until
the
roundup
started
out
once
more
when
he
would
ride
him
in
his
turn
it
was
the
blue
roan
without
doubt
coleman
came
to
a
stop
directly
in
front
of
andy
and
as
directly
came
to
the
point
look
here
green
he
began
i
shy
on
horses
for
that
contest
and
whitmore
and
bennett
say
i
can
have
that
roan
you
got
in
your
string
if
he
as
bad
as
you
claim
i
certainly
must
have
him
but
you
seem
to
have
some
doubts
of
what
he
do
and
i
like
to
see
him
ridden
once
your
shingle
is
out
as
a
will
you
ride
him
this
evening
so
i
can
size
him
up
for
that
contest
andy
glanced
up
under
his
eyebrows
and
then
sidelong
at
the
crowd
every
man
within
hearing
was
paying
strict
attention
and
was
eyeing
him
expectantly
for
is
a
spectacle
that
never
palls
well
i
can
ride
him
if
yuh
say
so
andy
made
cautious
answer
but
i
wo
gamble
he
a
bad
hoss
that
is
bad
enough
to
take
to
the
falls
yuh
do
want
to
expect
oh
i
do
expect
anything
only
i
want
to
see
him
ridden
once
come
on
no
time
like
the
present
if
he
bad
you
have
to
ride
him
at
the
fair
anyhow
and
a
little
practice
wo
hurt
you
and
if
he
is
i
want
to
know
it
for
sure
it
a
go
with
me
andy
said
indifferently
though
he
secretly
felt
much
relief
the
roan
would
go
off
like
a
pet
dog
and
he
could
pretend
to
be
somewhat
surprised
and
declare
that
he
had
reformed
bad
horses
do
reform
sometimes
as
andy
and
every
other
man
in
the
crowd
knew
then
there
would
be
no
more
foolish
speculation
about
the
cayuse
and
andy
could
keep
him
in
peace
and
have
a
mighty
good
as
he
had
schemed
he
smoked
a
cigarette
while
chip
was
having
the
horses
corralled
and
then
led
the
way
willingly
with
men
following
expectantly
at
his
heels
unlike
andy
they
fully
expected
an
impromptu
exhibition
of
fancy
riding
not
all
of
them
had
seen
andy
atop
a
bad
horse
and
the
diamond
g
men
in
particular
were
eager
to
witness
a
sample
of
his
skill
the
blue
roan
submitted
to
the
rope
and
there
was
nothing
spectacular
in
the
saddling
andy
kept
his
cigarette
between
his
lips
and
smiled
to
himself
when
he
saw
the
saddle
bunch
hazed
out
through
the
gate
and
the
big
corral
left
empty
of
every
animal
but
the
blue
roan
as
was
customary
when
a
man
tackled
a
horse
with
the
record
which
he
had
given
the
poor
beast
also
the
sight
of
men
roosting
high
their
hooked
under
a
corral
rail
to
steady
them
their
faces
writ
large
with
expectancy
amused
him
inwardly
he
pictured
their
disappointment
when
the
roan
trotted
around
the
corral
once
or
twice
at
his
bidding
and
smiled
again
if
you
ca
top
him
green
we
send
for
billy
roberts
take
off
the
rough
edge
and
gentle
him
down
for
yuh
taunted
a
diamond
g
man
do
get
excited
till
the
show
starts
andy
advised
holding
the
cigarette
in
his
fingers
while
he
emptied
his
lungs
of
smoke
just
to
make
a
pretence
of
caution
he
shook
the
saddle
tentatively
by
the
horn
and
wished
the
roan
would
make
a
little
show
of
resistance
instead
of
standing
there
like
an
old
cow
lacking
only
the
cud
as
he
complained
to
himself
to
make
the
resemblance
complete
the
roan
however
did
lay
back
an
ear
when
andy
the
cigarette
again
in
his
lips
put
his
toe
in
the
stirrup
go
after
it
you
weatherbeaten
old
he
yelled
just
to
make
the
play
strong
before
he
was
fairly
in
the
saddle
then
it
was
that
the
happy
family
heart
and
soul
and
pocket
all
for
andy
green
and
his
wonderful
skill
in
the
saddle
with
many
dollars
backing
their
belief
in
him
and
with
voices
ever
ready
to
sing
his
praises
with
the
golden
light
of
early
sunset
all
about
them
and
the
tang
of
coming
in
the
air
received
a
shock
that
made
them
turn
white
under
their
tan
mama
breathed
weary
in
a
horrified
and
slim
beside
him
blurted
well
by
in
a
voice
that
carried
across
the
corral
for
andy
green
tamer
of
wild
ones
forsooth
with
a
fame
that
not
the
boundary
of
chouteau
county
held
nor
yet
the
counties
beyond
andy
green
erstwhile
andré
de
gréno
champion
rider
of
the
western
hemisphere
who
had
jumped
through
blazing
hoops
and
over
sagging
bunting
while
he
rode
turned
handsprings
and
done
other
feats
was
prosaically
unequivocally
piled
at
the
fifth
jump
that
he
landed
lightly
on
his
feet
with
the
cigarette
still
between
his
lips
the
roosting
quite
overlooked
they
saw
only
the
first
jump
where
andy
riding
loose
and
unguardedly
went
up
on
the
blue
withers
the
second
third
and
fourth
jumps
were
not
far
enough
apart
to
be
seen
and
judged
separately
as
well
may
one
hope
to
decide
whether
a
whirling
wheel
had
straight
or
crooked
spokes
the
fifth
jump
however
was
a
masterpiece
of
contortion
and
it
was
important
because
it
left
andy
on
the
ground
gazing
with
an
extremely
grieved
expression
at
the
uninterrupted
convolutions
of
the
dandy
little
the
blue
roan
never
stopped
so
much
as
to
look
back
he
was
busy
exceedingly
busy
he
was
one
of
those
perverted
brutes
which
buck
and
bawl
and
so
keep
themselves
wrought
up
to
a
high
pitch
literally
and
figuratively
he
set
himself
seriously
to
throw
andy
saddle
over
his
head
and
he
was
not
a
horse
which
easily
accepts
defeat
andy
walked
around
in
the
middle
of
the
corral
quite
aimlessly
and
watched
the
roan
contort
he
could
not
understand
in
the
least
and
his
amazement
overshadowed
for
the
moment
the
fact
that
he
had
been
thrown
and
that
in
public
and
before
men
of
the
diamond
then
it
was
that
the
men
of
the
diamond
g
yelled
shrill
words
of
ironical
sympathy
then
it
was
that
the
happy
family
looked
at
one
another
in
shamed
silence
and
to
the
taunts
of
the
diamond
gs
made
no
reply
it
had
never
occurred
to
them
that
such
a
thing
could
happen
had
they
not
seen
andy
ride
easily
and
often
had
they
not
heard
from
pink
how
andy
had
performed
that
difficult
feat
at
the
rocking
r
the
feat
of
throwing
his
horse
flat
in
the
middle
of
a
jump
they
waited
until
the
roan
leaving
the
big
corral
looking
in
the
fast
deepening
twilight
like
a
field
stopped
dejectedly
and
stood
with
his
nose
against
the
closed
gate
and
then
climbed
slowly
down
from
the
top
rail
of
the
corral
still
silent
with
the
silence
more
eloquent
than
speech
in
any
known
language
over
by
the
gate
andy
was
yanking
savagely
at
the
latigo
and
he
also
had
never
a
word
to
say
he
was
still
wondering
how
it
had
happened
he
looked
the
roan
over
critically
and
shook
his
head
against
the
riddle
for
he
had
known
him
to
be
a
quiet
dependable
good
horse
with
no
bad
traits
and
an
disposition
that
fretted
at
nothing
a
nervous
beast
might
from
rough
usage
and
abuse
go
bad
but
the
blue
roan
they
had
called
him
pardner
had
never
showed
the
slightest
symptom
of
nerves
andy
knew
horses
as
he
knew
himself
that
a
horse
like
pardner
should
in
two
years
become
an
in
such
devilish
pitching
as
that
was
past
belief
i
guess
he
do
all
right
spoke
coleman
at
his
elbow
i
seen
horses
pitch
and
i
will
say
that
he
got
some
specialties
that
are
worth
exhibiting
then
as
a
polite
way
of
letting
andy
down
easy
he
added
i
do
wonder
you
could
connect
connect
it
was
andy
first
realization
of
what
his
failure
meant
to
the
others
he
left
off
wondering
about
the
roan
and
faced
the
fact
that
he
had
been
thrown
fair
and
square
and
that
before
an
audience
of
pairs
of
eyes
which
had
seen
rough
riding
before
and
which
had
expected
of
him
something
better
than
they
were
accustomed
to
seeing
i
reckon
billy
roberts
will
have
to
work
on
that
cayuse
a
while
fleered
a
diamond
g
man
coming
over
to
them
he
gentle
him
down
so
that
anybody
can
ride

andy
faced
him
hotly
opened
his
mouth
for
sharp
reply
and
closed
it
he
had
been
piled
nothing
that
he
could
say
might
alter
that
fact
nor
explanations
lighten
the
disgrace
he
turned
and
went
out
the
gate
carrying
his
saddle
and
bridle
with
him
aw
and
you
was
goin
t
ride
in
that
contest

dollars

pink
in
his
ear
but
loyal
to
the
last

to
blat
around
and
let
them
diamond
gs
give
yuh
the
laugh

up
something

a
backbone
till

for
heaven
sake

our
man
so
help
me

if
anybody
goes
rubbing
it
in
where
i
can
hear
he
get
his
face
punched
say
i
guess
we
ai
let
down
on
our
faces
or
anything
sighed
cal
emmett
coming
up
to
them
i
thought
andy
could
ride
gee
whiz
but
it
was
fierce
why
could
make
a
better
ride
than
that
by
golly
i
want
t
have
a
talk
with
that
there
slim
growled
behind
them
i
got
money
on
him
is
he
goin
t
ride
for
that
purse
if
he
is
i
ai
going
a
foot
these
and
other
remarks
of
a
like
nature
made
up
the
clamor
that
surged
in
the
ears
of
andy
as
he
went
disgraced
and
alone
up
to
the
deserted
where
he
need
not
hear
what
they
were
saying
he
knew
deep
in
his
heart
that
he
could
ride
that
horse
he
had
been
thrown
because
of
his
own
unpardonable
carelessness
a
carelessness
which
he
could
not
well
explain
to
the
others
he
himself
had
given
the
roan
an
evil
reputation
a
reputation
that
so
far
as
he
knew
was
libel
pure
and
simple
to
explain
now
that
he
was
thrown
simply
because
he
never
dreamed
the
horse
would
pitch
and
so
was
taken
unaware
would
simply
be
to
insult
their
intelligence
he
was
not
supposed
after
mounting
a
horse
like
that
to
be
taken
unaware
he
might
of
course
say
that
he
had
lied
all
along
but
he
had
no
intention
of
making
any
confession
like
that
even
if
he
did
they
would
not
believe
him
altogether
it
was
a
very
unhappy
young
man
who
slammed
his
spurs
into
a
far
corner
and
kicked
viciously
a
box
he
had
stumbled
over
in
the
dusk
trying
to
bust
the
furniture
it
was
the
voice
of
the
old
man
at
the
door
by
gracious
it
seems
i
ca
bust
no
more
andy
made
rueful
reply
i
reckon
i
just
about
have
to
bust
the
furniture
or
nothing
the
old
man
chuckled
and
came
inside
sought
the
box
andy
had
kicked
and
sat
down
upon
it
through
the
open
door
came
the
jumble
of
many
voices
upraised
in
fruitless
argument
and
with
it
the
chill
of
frost
the
old
man
fumbled
for
his
pipe
filled
it
and
scratched
a
match
sharply
on
the
box
in
the
flare
of
it
andy
watched
his
kind
old
face
with
its
fringe
of
grayish
hair
and
its
lines
of
whimsical
humor
doggone
them
boys
they
ai
got
the
stayin
qualities
i
give
credit
for
having
he
remarked
holding
up
the
match
and
looking
across
at
andy
humped
disconsolately
in
the
shadows
them
diamond
g
men
has
just
about
got
on
the
run
right
now
yuh
could
get
a
bet
down
there
andy
merely
grunted
say
asked
the
old
man
suddenly
did
yuh
kinda
mistake
that
blue
roan
for
his
twin
brother
pardner
this
here
cayuse
is
called
weaver
i
tried
t
get
hold
of
one
but
doggone
they
loosen
up
pardner
was
for
sale
at
no
price
but
they
talked
me
into
buying
the
weaver
they
claimed
he
just
about
as
good
a
horse
once
he
tamed
down
some
and
i
thought
seein
i
got
some
real
on
my
i
take
a
chance
on
him
i
thought
yuh
knew
the
horse
the
way
yuh
read
up
his
pedigree
till
i
seen
yuh
mount
him
why
doggone
it
yuh
straddled
him
like
yuh
was
just
climbing
a
fence
maybe
yuh
know
your
own
business
best
but
did
yuh
kinda
mistake
him
for
pardner
they
as
near
alike
as
two
bullets
run
in
the
same
mold
as
far
as
go
andy
got
up
and
went
to
the
door
and
stood
looking
down
the
hill
to
the
white
blotch
which
was
the
camp
listened
to
the
jumble
of
voices
still
upraised
in
fruitless
argument
and
turned
to
the
old
man
by
gracious
that
accounts
for
a
whole
lot
he
said
ambiguously
ii
i
do
see
said
cal
emmett
crossly
what
the
use
uh
this
whole
outfit
trailing
up
to
that
contest
if
i
was
chip
i
call
the
deal
off
and
start
gathering
calves
it
ai
as
if
we
had
a
man
to
ride
for
that
belt
and
purse
ai
your
leg
well
enough
to
tackle
it
pink
no
pink
answered
shortly
it
ai
riding
the
rough
bunch
they
rounded
up
for
that
contest
going
to
be
any
picnic
weary
defended
his
chum
cadwolloper
would
need
two
good
legs
to
go
up
against
that
deal
i
wish
irish
was
here
pink
gloomed
i
be
willing
to
back
him
all
right
but
it
too
late
now
he
could
enter
if
he
was
here
a
voice
behind
them
spoke
challengingly
i
do
believe
it
would
be
etiquette
for
one
outfit
to
enter
peelers
one
enough
it
the
happy
family
turned
coldly
upon
the
speaker
it
was
slim
who
answered
for
them
all
i
dunno
as
this
outfit
has
got
peeler
in
that
contest
by
golly
it
do
look
like
it
since
las
night
weary
was
gentle
as
always
but
he
was
firm
we
kinda
thought
want
to
withdraw
he
added
andy
green
tamer
of
wild
ones
turned
and
eyed
weary
curiously
one
might
guess
from
telltale
eyes
and
mouth
that
his
calmness
did
not
go
very
deep
i
do
recollect
mentioning
that
i
was
busy
penning
any
letter
uh
withdrawal
he
said
i
got
my
sights
raised
to
that
purse
and
that
belt
i
do
recollect
saying
anything
about
lowering
aw
gwan
i
guess
try
for
that
purse
too
i
betche
i
got
as
good
a
show
as
sure
help
yourself
it
do
cost
nothing
i
do
doubt
but
what
you
make
a
real
pretty
ride
happy
andy
tone
was
deceitfully
hearty
he
did
not
sound
in
the
least
as
if
he
would
like
to
choke
happy
jack
though
that
was
his
secret
longing
aw
gwan
i
betche
i
could
make
as
purty
a
ride
as
saw
lately
happy
jack
did
not
quite
like
to
make
the
thing
too
personal
for
fear
of
what
might
happen
after
yuh
mean
last
night
do
yuh
purred
andy
well
by
golly
i
wish
you
tell
us
what
yuh
done
it
for
slim
cut
in
disgustedly
it
was
nacherlay
supposed
you
could
ride
we
got
up
on
yuh
and
then
by
golly
to
go
and
make
a
fluke
like
that
before
them
diamond
g
men
to
go
and
let
that
blue
roan
pile
yuh
up
he
got
rightly
started
t
pitch
if
yuh
stayed
with
him
till
he
got
t
swappin
ends
there
it
would
uh
looked
quite
so
bad
but
t
go
and
git
throwed
down
right
in
the
start
by
golly
slim
faced
andy
accusingly
them
diamond
g
men
and
i
got
money
up
by
golly
yuh
ai
lost
any
money
yet
have
yuh
andy
inquired
patiently
what
andy
felt
like
doing
was
to
wade
into
the
bunch
reason
however
told
him
that
he
had
it
coming
from
them
and
to
take
his
medicine
since
he
could
not
well
explain
just
how
it
had
happened
he
could
not
in
reason
wonder
that
the
faith
of
the
happy
family
was
shattered
and
that
they
mourned
as
lost
the
money
they
had
already
rashly
wagered
on
the
outcome
of
the
contest
the
very
completeness
of
their
faith
in
him
their
very
loyalty
seemed
to
them
their
undoing
for
to
them
the
case
was
plain
enough
if
andy
could
not
ride
the
blue
roan
in
their
own
corral
how
was
he
to
ride
that
same
blue
roan
in
great
falls
or
if
he
could
ride
him
how
could
any
sane
man
hope
that
he
could
win
the
purse
and
the
belt
under
the
stringent
rules
of
the
contest
where
riding
on
the
spurs
pulling
leather
and
a
dozen
other
things
were
barred
so
andy
under
the
sting
of
their
innuendoes
and
blunt
reproaches
was
so
patient
as
to
seem
to
them
cowed
no
i
ai
lost
any
yet
but
by
golly
i
can
see
it
fixin
to
fly
slim
retorted
heavily
andy
looked
around
at
the
others
and
smiled
as
sarcastically
as
was
possible
considering
the
mood
he
was
in
it
sure
does
amuse
me
he
observed
to
see
growed
men
cryin
before
they
hurt
by
gracious
i
expect
t
make
a
stake
out
uh
that
fall
i
can
get
long
odds
from
them
diamond
gs
and
from
anybody
they
get
a
chance
to
talk
to
kinda
planning
he
lied
boldly
to
winter
in
an
orange
grove
and
listen
at
the
birds
singing
after
i
through
with
the
deal
i
reckon
yuh
can
count
on
hearing
the
birds
sing
all
right
pink
snapped
back
it
be
for
yours
if
last
night
a
fair
sample
uh
what
yuh
expect
to
do
with
the
blue
roan
pink
walked
abruptly
away
looking
very
much
like
a
sulky
cherub
i
yuh
aiming
to
give
us
the
impression
that
you
going
to
ride
just
the
same
said
cal
emmett
i
sure
am
came
brief
reply
andy
was
beginning
to
lose
his
temper
he
had
expected
that
the
happy
family
would
throw
it
into
him
to
a
certain
extent
and
he
had
schooled
himself
to
take
their
drubbing
what
he
had
not
expected
was
their
unfriendly
attitude
which
went
beyond
mere
disappointment
and
made
his
offence
if
it
could
be
called
that
more
serious
than
the
occasion
would
seem
to
warrant
perhaps
jack
bates
unwittingly
made
plain
the
situation
when
he
remarked
i
hate
to
turn
down
one
of
our
bunch
we
kinda
got
in
the
habit
uh
hanging
together
and
backing
each
other
play
regardless
but
darn
it
we
ai
millionaires
none
of
us
and
gambling
it
is
a
sin
got
enough
up
already
to
keep
me
broke
for
six
months
if
i
lose
and
the
rest
are
in
about
the
same
fix
i
ai
raising
no
long
howl
andy
but
you
can
see
yourself
where
we
kinda
bashful
about
sinking
any
more
on
yuh
than
what
we
have
maybe
you
can
ride
i
heard
yuh
can
and
i
seen
yuh
make
some
fair
rides
myself
but
yuh
sure
fell
down
hard
last
night
and
my
faith
in
yuh
got
a
jolt
that
fair
broke
its
back
if
yuh
done
it
deliberate
for
reasons
we
do
know
for
heaven
sake
say
so
and
we
take
your
word
for
it
and
forget
your
rep
for
lying
on
the
dead
andy
did
yuh
fall
off
deliberate
andy
bit
his
lip
his
conscience
had
a
theory
of
its
own
about
and
permitted
him
to
make
strange
assertions
at
times
still
there
were
limitations
the
happy
family
was
waiting
for
his
answer
and
he
knew
instinctively
that
they
would
believe
him
now
for
a
moment
temptation
held
him
then
he
squared
his
shoulders
and
spoke
truly
on
the
dead
i
hit
the
ground
unexpected
and
inadvertant
i
if
that
the
case
then
the
farther
yuh
keep
away
from
that
contest
the
better
if
yuh
ask
jack
turned
on
his
heel
and
followed
pink
andy
stared
after
him
moodily
then
glanced
at
the
rest
with
one
accord
they
avoided
meeting
his
gaze
damn
a
bunch
uh
quitters
he
flared
hotly
and
left
them
to
hunt
up
the
old
man
and
chip
one
or
both
it
did
not
matter
to
him
pink
it
was
who
observed
the
old
man
writing
a
check
for
andy
he
took
it
that
andy
had
called
for
his
time
and
when
andy
rolled
his
bed
and
stowed
it
away
in
the
saddled
a
horse
and
rode
up
the
grade
toward
town
the
whole
outfit
knew
for
a
certainty
that
andy
had
quit
before
many
hours
had
passed
they
too
saddled
and
rode
away
with
the
wagons
and
the
cavvy
following
after
and
they
were
headed
for
great
falls
and
the
fair
there
to
be
held
or
more
particularly
the
contest
to
which
they
had
looked
forward
eagerly
and
with
much
enthusiasm
and
which
they
were
now
approaching
gloomily
and
in
deep
humiliation
truly
it
would
be
hard
to
find
a
situation
more
galling
to
the
pride
of
the
happy
family
but
andy
green
had
not
called
for
his
time
and
he
had
no
intention
of
quitting
for
andy
was
also
suffering
from
that
uncomfortable
malady
which
we
call
hurt
pride
and
for
it
he
knew
but
one
remedy
a
remedy
which
he
was
impatient
to
apply
because
of
the
unfriendly
attitude
of
the
happy
family
andy
had
refused
to
take
them
into
his
confidence
or
to
ride
with
them
to
the
fair
instead
he
had
drawn
what
money
was
still
placed
to
his
credit
on
the
had
taken
a
horse
and
his
riding
outfit
and
gone
away
to
dry
lake
where
he
intended
to
take
the
train
for
great
falls
in
dry
lake
however
he
found
that
the
story
of
his
downfall
had
preceded
him
thanks
to
the
exultant
men
of
the
diamond
g
and
that
the
tale
had
not
shrunk
in
the
telling
dry
lake
jeered
him
as
openly
as
it
dared
and
part
of
it
that
part
which
had
believed
in
him
was
quite
as
unfriendly
as
was
the
happy
family
to
a
man
they
took
it
for
granted
that
he
would
withdraw
from
the
contest
and
they
were
not
careful
to
conceal
what
they
thought
andy
found
himself
rather
left
alone
and
he
experienced
more
than
once
the
unpleasant
sensation
of
having
conversation
suddenly
lag
when
he
came
near
and
of
seeing
groups
of
men
dissolve
awkwardly
at
his
approach
andy
before
he
had
been
in
town
an
hour
was
in
a
mood
to
do
violence
for
that
reason
he
kept
his
plans
rigidly
to
himself
when
someone
asked
him
if
he
had
quit
the
outfit
he
had
returned
gruffly
that
the
flying
u
was
not
the
only
in
the
country
and
let
the
questioner
interpret
it
as
he
liked
when
the
train
that
had
its
nose
pointed
to
the
southwest
slid
into
town
andy
did
not
step
on
as
had
been
his
intention
he
remained
idly
leaning
over
the
bar
in
rusty
brown
place
and
gave
no
heed
later
when
the
eastbound
came
schreeching
through
at
midnight
it
found
andy
green
on
the
platform
with
his
saddle
bridle
chaps
quirt
and
spurs
neatly
sacked
and
with
a
ticket
for
havre
in
his
pocket
so
the
wise
ones
said
that
they
knew
andy
would
never
have
the
nerve
to
show
up
at
the
fair
after
the
fluke
he
had
made
at
the
flying
u
ranch
and
those
whose
pockets
were
not
interested
considered
it
a
very
good
joke
at
havre
andy
bought
another
ticket
and
checked
the
sack
which
held
his
riding
outfit
the
ticket
had
great
falls
printed
on
it
in
bold
black
lettering
so
that
he
was
twelve
hours
late
in
reaching
his
original
destination
and
to
avoid
unwelcome
discovery
and
comment
he
took
the
sleeper
and
immediately
ordered
his
berth
made
up
that
he
might
pass
through
dry
lake
behind
the
sheltering
folds
of
the
berth
curtains
not
that
there
was
need
of
this
elaborate
subterfuge
he
was
simply
mad
clear
through
and
did
not
want
to
see
or
hear
the
voice
of
any
man
he
knew
besides
the
days
when
he
had
danced
in
spangled
tights
upon
the
broad
gray
rump
of
a
galloping
horse
while
a
man
in
the
middle
of
the
ring
cracked
a
whip
and
yelped
commands
had
bred
in
him
the
unconscious
love
of
a
spectacular
entry
and
a
dramatic
finish
that
is
why
he
sought
out
the
most
obscure
rooming
house
that
gave
any
promise
of
decency
and
comfort
and
stayed
off
central
avenue
and
away
from
its
loitering
groups
of
range
dwellers
who
might
know
him
that
is
why
he
hired
a
horse
and
rode
early
and
alone
to
the
fair
grounds
on
the
opening
day
and
avoided
by
a
roundabout
trail
a
certain
splotch
of
against
the
brown
of
the
prairie
which
he
knew
instinctively
to
be
the
camp
of
the
flying
u
outfit
which
had
made
good
time
and
were
located
to
their
liking
near
the
river
andy
felt
a
tightening
of
the
chest
when
he
saw
the
familiar
tents
and
kicked
his
hired
horse
in
the
ribs
it
was
all
so
different
from
what
he
had
thought
it
would
be
in
those
last
two
weeks
he
had
pictured
himself
riding
vaingloriously
through
town
on
his
best
horse
with
a
new
navajo
making
a
dab
of
bright
color
and
a
new
stetson
hat
dimpled
picturesquely
as
to
crown
and
tilted
rakishly
over
one
eye
and
with
his
spurs
catching
the
light
around
him
would
ride
the
happy
family
also
in
gala
attire
and
mounted
upon
the
best
horses
in
their
several
strings
the
horses
would
not
approve
of
the
and
would
circle
and
back
and
it
was
quite
possible
even
probable
that
there
would
be
some
pitching
and
some
pretty
riding
before
the
gaping
populace
which
did
not
often
get
a
chance
to
view
the
real
thing
people
would
stop
and
gaze
while
they
went
clattering
by
and
he
andy
green
would
be
pointed
out
by
the
knowing
ones
as
a
fellow
that
was
going
to
ride
in
the
contest
and
that
stood
a
good
chance
of
winning
for
andy
was
but
human
that
he
dreamed
of
these
things
besides
does
not
the
jumping
through
blazing
hoops
and
over
sagging
bunting
while
one
rides
whet
insiduously
one
appetite
for
the
plaudits
of
the
crowd
the
reality
was
different
he
was
in
great
falls
but
he
had
not
ridden
vaingloriously
down
central
avenue
surrounded
by
the
happy
family
and
watched
by
the
gaping
populace
instead
he
had
chosen
a
side
street
and
he
had
ridden
alone
and
no
one
had
seemed
to
know
or
care
who
he
might
be
his
horse
had
not
backed
before
an
approaching
car
and
he
had
not
done
any
pretty
riding
instead
his
horse
had
scarce
turned
an
eye
toward
the
jangling
bell
when
he
crossed
the
track
perilously
close
to
the
car
and
he
had
gone
decorously
down
the
street
and
andy
hated
a
pacing
horse
the
happy
family
was
in
town
but
he
did
not
know
where
andy
kicked
his
horse
into
a
gallop
and
swore
bitterly
that
he
did
not
care
he
did
not
suppose
that
they
gave
him
a
thought
other
than
those
impelled
by
their
jeopardized
pockets
and
that
he
assured
himself
pessimistically
is
friendship
he
tied
the
hired
horse
to
the
fence
and
went
away
to
the
stables
and
fraternized
with
a
jockey
who
knew
a
few
things
himself
about
riding
and
was
inclined
to
talk
unprofessionally
it
was
not
at
all
as
andy
had
pictured
the
opening
day
but
he
got
through
the
time
somehow
until
the
crowd
gathered
and
the
racing
began
then
he
showed
himself
in
the
crowd
of
peelers
and
their
friends
as
unconcernedly
as
he
might
and
as
unobtrusively
the
happy
family
he
observed
was
not
there
though
he
met
chip
face
to
face
and
had
a
short
talk
with
him
chip
was
the
only
one
aside
from
the
old
man
who
really
understood
billy
roberts
was
there
and
he
greeted
andy
commiseratingly
as
one
speaks
to
the
sick
or
to
one
in
mourning
the
tone
made
andy
grind
his
teeth
though
he
knew
in
his
heart
that
billy
roberts
wished
him
well
up
to
the
point
of
losing
the
contest
to
him
which
was
beyond
human
nature
billy
roberts
was
a
rider
and
knew
or
thought
he
knew
just
how
sore
andy
must
be
feeling
also
in
the
kindness
of
his
heart
he
tried
blunderingly
to
hide
his
knowledge
going
up
against
the
rough
ones
he
queried
with
careful
carelessness
in
the
hope
of
concealing
that
he
had
heard
the
tale
of
andy
disgrace
i
sure
am
andy
returned
laconically
with
no
attempt
to
conceal
anything
billy
roberts
opened
his
eyes
wide
and
his
mouth
a
little
before
he
recovered
from
his
surprise
well
good
luck
to
yuh
he
managed
to
say
only
so
yuh
do
beat
me
to
it
i
was
kinda
hoping
yuh
was
too
bashful
to
get
out
and
ride
before
all
the
ladies
andy
remembering
his
days
in
the
sawdust
ring
smiled
queerly
but
his
heart
warmed
to
billy
roberts
amazingly
they
were
leaning
elbows
on
the
fence
below
the
grand
stand
watching
desultorily
the
endless
preparatory
manoeuvres
of
three
men
astride
the
hind
legs
of
three
pacers
in
sulkies
this
business
gives
me
a
pain
billy
remarked
as
the
pacers
ambled
by
for
the
fourth
or
fifth
time
i
like
that
do
take
all
day
to
wind
up
before
they
go
i
been
looking
over
our
bunch
horses
in
that
corral
that
are
sure
going
to
do
things
to
us
twenty
peelers
by
gracious
yes
andy
was
beginning
to
feel
himself
again
that
blue
hoss
uh
course
yuh
heard
how
he
got
me
and
heard
it
with
trimmings
yuh
may
think
he
a
but
while
he
a
bad
hoss
all
right
he
ai
the
one
that
get
yuh
yuh
want
t
watch
out
billy
for
that
hs
sorrel
he
plumb
wicked
he
got
a
habit
uh
throwing
himself
backwards
they
keeping
it
quiet
maybe
but
seen
him
do
it
three
times
in
one
summer
all
right
thanks
i
did
know
that
but
the
blue
roan
the
blue
roan
pitch
and
bawl
and
swap
ends
on
yuh
and
raise
hell
all
around
but
he
can
be
rode
that
festive
bunch
up
in
the
reserve
seats
think
it
awful
and
that
the
hs
sorrel
is
a
lady
hoss
alongside
him
but
a
real
rider
can
wear
him
out
but
that
sorrel
when
yuh
think
yuh
got
him
beat
billy
is
when
yuh
want
to
watch
out
billy
turned
his
face
away
from
a
rolling
dustcloud
that
came
down
the
home
stretch
with
the
pacers
and
looked
curiously
at
andy
twice
he
started
to
speak
and
did
not
finish
then
a
man
can
be
a
rider
and
get
careless
and
let
a
horse
pile
him
off
him
when
he
looking
just
because
he
knows
he
can
ride
that
horse
he
said
with
a
certain
diffidence
by
gracious
yes
andy
assented
emphatically
and
that
was
the
nearest
they
came
to
discussing
a
delicate
matter
which
was
in
the
minds
of
both
andy
was
growing
more
at
ease
and
feeling
more
optimistic
every
minute
three
men
still
believed
in
him
which
was
much
also
the
crowd
could
not
flurry
him
as
it
did
some
of
the
others
who
were
not
accustomed
to
so
great
an
audience
rather
it
acted
as
a
tonic
and
brought
back
the
poise
the
easy
which
had
belonged
to
one
andré
de
gréno
champion
bareback
rider
so
that
when
the
began
andy
nerves
were
placidly
asleep
at
the
corral
in
the
infield
where
the
horses
and
men
were
foregathered
andy
met
slim
and
happy
jack
but
beyond
his
curt
hello
and
an
amazed
well
by
golly
from
slim
no
words
passed
across
the
corral
he
glimpsed
some
of
the
others
pink
and
weary
and
farther
along
cal
emmett
and
jack
bates
but
they
made
no
sign
if
they
saw
him
and
he
did
not
go
near
them
he
did
not
know
when
his
turn
would
come
to
ride
and
he
had
a
horse
to
saddle
at
the
command
of
the
powers
that
were
coleman
the
man
who
had
collected
the
horses
almost
ran
over
him
he
said
hello
green
and
passed
on
for
his
haste
was
great
horse
after
horse
was
saddled
and
led
perforce
out
into
the
open
of
the
infield
man
after
man
mounted
with
more
or
less
trouble
and
rode
to
triumph
or
defeat
billy
roberts
was
given
a
little
bay
and
did
some
great
riding
the
shouts
and
applause
from
the
grand
stand
rolled
out
to
them
in
a
great
wave
of
sound
billy
mastered
the
brute
and
rode
him
back
to
the
corral
and
with
beads
of
sweat
standing
thick
on
his
forehead
it
ai
going
to
be
such
damn
easy
money
that
two
hundred
he
confided
pantingly
to
andy
who
stood
near
the
fellow
that
gets
it
will
sure
have
to
earn
it
andy
nodded
and
moved
out
where
he
could
get
a
better
view
then
coleman
came
and
informed
him
hurriedly
that
he
came
next
and
andy
went
back
to
his
place
the
horse
he
was
to
ride
he
had
never
seen
before
that
day
he
was
a
brown
with
scanty
mane
and
a
wicked
rolling
eye
he
looked
capable
of
almost
any
deviltry
but
andy
did
not
give
much
time
to
speculating
upon
what
he
would
try
to
do
he
was
still
all
eyes
to
the
infield
where
his
predecessor
was
gyrating
then
a
sudden
jump
loosened
him
so
that
he
grabbed
the
horn
and
it
was
all
over
with
that
particular
applicant
so
far
as
the
purse
and
the
championship
belt
were
concerned
he
was
out
of
the
contest
and
presently
he
was
also
back
at
the
corral
explaining
volubly
and
uselessly
just
how
it
came
about
he
appeared
to
have
a
very
good
reason
for
pulling
leather
but
andy
was
not
listening
and
only
thought
absently
that
the
fellow
was
a
fool
to
make
a
talk
for
himself
andy
was
clutching
the
stirrup
and
watching
a
chance
to
put
his
toe
into
it
and
the
tall
brown
horse
was
circling
backwards
with
occasional
little
when
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
horse
did
not
mean
to
be
mounted
andy
reached
out
his
hand
got
a
rope
from
somebody
he
did
not
know
who
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
pink
who
gave
it
and
snared
a
front
foot
presently
the
brown
was
standing
upon
three
legs
instead
of
four
and
the
gaping
populace
wondered
how
it
was
done
and
craned
necks
to
see
after
that
though
the
horse
still
circled
backwards
andy
got
the
stirrup
and
put
his
toe
in
it
and
went
up
so
easily
that
the
ignorant
might
think
anybody
could
do
it
he
dropped
the
rope
and
saw
that
it
was
pink
who
picked
it
up
the
brown
at
first
did
nothing
at
all
then
he
gave
a
spring
straight
ahead
and
ran
fifty
yards
or
so
stopped
and
began
to
pitch
three
jumps
and
he
ran
again
stopped
and
reared
it
was
very
pretty
to
look
at
but
happy
jack
could
have
ridden
him
or
slim
or
any
other
range
rider
in
two
minutes
the
brown
was
sulking
and
it
took
severe
spurring
to
bring
him
back
to
the
corral
pitch
he
would
not
the
crowd
applauded
but
andy
felt
cheated
and
looked
as
he
felt
pink
edged
toward
him
but
andy
was
not
in
the
mood
for
reconciliation
and
kept
out
of
his
way
others
of
the
happy
family
came
near
at
divers
times
and
places
as
if
they
would
have
speech
with
him
but
he
thought
he
knew
about
what
they
would
say
and
so
was
careful
not
to
give
them
a
chance
when
the
excitement
was
all
over
for
that
day
he
got
his
despised
hired
horse
and
went
back
to
town
with
billy
roberts
because
it
was
good
to
have
a
friend
and
because
they
wanted
to
talk
about
the
riding
billy
did
not
tell
andy
either
that
he
had
had
hard
work
getting
away
from
his
own
crowd
for
billy
was
and
had
heard
a
good
deal
because
he
had
been
talking
with
happy
jack
his
sympathy
was
not
with
the
happy
family
either
on
the
second
afternoon
such
is
effect
of
rigid
winnowing
there
were
but
nine
men
to
ride
the
fellow
who
had
grabbed
the
saddle
horn
together
with
ten
others
stood
among
the
spectators
and
made
caustic
remarks
about
the
management
the
horses
the
nine
who
were
left
and
the
whole
business
in
general
andy
grinned
a
little
and
wondered
if
he
would
stand
among
them
on
the
morrow
and
make
remarks
he
was
not
worrying
about
it
though
he
said
hello
to
weary
pink
and
cal
emmett
and
saddled
a
kicking
striking
brute
from
up
sweetgrass
way
on
this
day
the
horses
were
wickeder
and
one
man
came
near
getting
his
neck
broken
as
it
was
his
snapped
and
he
was
carried
off
the
infield
on
a
stretcher
and
hurried
to
the
hospital
which
did
not
tend
to
make
the
other
riders
feel
more
cheerful
andy
noted
that
it
was
the
hs
sorrel
which
did
the
mischief
and
glanced
meaningly
across
at
billy
roberts
then
it
was
his
turn
with
the
striking
kicking
gray
and
he
mounted
and
prepared
for
what
might
come
the
gray
was
an
artist
in
his
line
and
pitched
high
wide
and
crooked
in
the
most
approved
fashion
but
andy
being
also
an
artist
of
a
sort
rode
easily
and
with
a
grace
that
brought
much
from
the
crowd
only
the
initiated
reserved
their
praise
till
further
trial
for
though
the
gray
was
not
to
say
gentle
and
though
it
took
skill
to
ride
him
there
were
a
dozen
probably
twice
as
many
men
in
the
crowd
who
could
have
done
as
well
the
happy
family
drawn
together
from
habit
and
because
they
could
speak
their
minds
more
freely
discussed
andy
gravely
among
themselves
betting
was
growing
brisk
and
if
their
faith
had
not
been
so
shaken
they
could
have
got
long
odds
on
andy
i
betche
he
do
win
out
happy
jack
insisted
with
characteristic
gloom
yuh
wait
till
he
goes
up
agin
that
blue
roan
they
that
roan
till
the
las
day
and
i
betche
andy
git
him
if
he
hangs
on
till
the
las
day
happy
jack
laughed
ironically
as
he
made
the
provision
any
you
fellows
got
money
yuh
want
to
put
up
on
this
deal
came
the
voice
of
andy
behind
them
they
turned
a
bit
shamefaced
toward
him
aw
i
betche
began
happy
that
what
i
here
for

long
distances

a
high
wind
i
bet
yuh
fifty
dollars
yuh

pull
down
that
belt
or

golly
there
two
or
three
men

the
real
star
smiled
andy
with
unashamed
egotism
happy
how
rich
do
want
to
get
off
me
happy
said
a
good
deal
and
betche
several
things
would
happen
things
utterly
inconsistent
with
one
another
in
the
end
andy
pinned
him
down
to
twenty
dollars
against
andy
spurs
which
was
almost
a
third
more
than
the
spurs
were
worth
but
andy
had
no
sympathy
for
happy
jack
and
stuck
to
the
price
doggedly
until
happy
gave
in
jack
bates
advertised
his
lack
of
faith
in
andy
ten
dollars
worth
and
cal
emmett
did
the
same
irish
coming
in
on
the
afternoon
train
and
drifting
instinctively
to
the
vicinity
of
the
happy
family
cursed
them
all
impartially
for
a
bunch
of
quitters
slapped
andy
on
the
back
and
with
characteristic
impetuosity
offered
a
hundred
dollars
to
anybody
who
dared
take
him
up
that
andy
would
win
and
this
after
he
had
heard
the
tale
of
the
blue
roan
and
before
they
told
him
about
the
two
rides
already
made
in
the
contest
it
is
true
that
happy
jack
endeavored
to
expostulate
but
irish
glared
at
him
in
a
way
to
make
happy
squirm
and
stammer
incoherently
i
heard
all
about
it
irish
cut
in
and
i
do
have
to
hear
any
more
i
know
a
rider
when
i
see
one
and
my
money
on
andy
from
start
to
finish
you
make
me
sick
weary
have
gone
against
our
man
the
tone
was
a
challenge
in
itself
weary
grinned
goodnaturedly
i
have
pulled
down
any
bets
he
answered
mildly
and
i
have
put
up
my
last
cent
and
do
intend
to
i
an
engaged
young
man
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
to
point
the
moral
i
sure
do
hope
andy
win
out
he
added
simply
why
damn
it
yuh
he
win
stormed
irish
men
in
their
vicinity
caught
the
belligerence
of
the
tone
and
turned
about
thinking
there
was
trouble
and
the
happy
family
subsided
into
quieter
discussion
in
the
end
irish
discovering
that
andy
had
for
the
time
being
forsworn
the
shelter
of
the
flying
u
tents
stuck
by
him
loyally
and
forswore
it
also
and
went
with
andy
to
share
the
doubtful
comfort
of
the
obscure
lodging
house
for
irish
was
all
or
nothing
and
to
find
the
happy
family
publicly
opposed
or
at
most
neutral
to
a
flying
u
man
in
a
contest
like
this
incensed
him
much
the
happy
family
began
to
feel
less
sure
of
themselves
and
a
bit
ashamed
though
of
just
what
they
were
not
quite
clear
for
surely
they
had
reason
for
doubting
andy
green
the
last
day
found
the
happy
family
divided
against
itself
and
growing
a
bit
venomous
in
its
remarks
andy
had
not
as
yet
done
anything
remarkable
except
perhaps
keep
in
the
running
when
the
twenty
had
been
culled
to
three
billy
roberts
andy
and
a
man
from
the
yellowstone
valley
called
gopher
by
his
acquaintances
accident
and
untoward
circumstances
had
thrown
out
the
others
good
riders
all
of
them
or
they
would
not
have
been
there
happy
jack
proclaimed
loudly
in
camp
that
andy
was
still
in
because
andy
had
not
had
a
real
bad
horse
i
seen
coleman
looking
over
the
blue
roan
and
talkin
to
them
guys
that
runs
things
they
goin
t
put
andy
on
him
i
betche
and
we
seen
how
he
can
him
piled
in
a
heap
not
exactly
pink
interrupted
i
seem
to
remember
andy
lighting
on
his
feet
and
he
was
smoking
when
he
started
and
smoking
when
he
quit
it
did
strike
me
at
the
time
but
that
kinda
funny
yuh
think
so
pink
went
back
to
his
first
faith
and
the
happy
family
straightway
became
loud
and
excited
over
the
question
of
whether
andy
did
really
light
upon
his
feet
or
jumped
up
immediately
and
whether
he
kept
his
cigarette
or
made
a
new
one
the
discussion
carried
them
to
the
fair
grounds
and
remained
just
where
it
started
so
far
as
any
amicable
decision
was
concerned
now
this
is
a
fair
and
true
report
of
that
last
day
riding
there
being
but
the
three
riders
and
the
excitement
growing
apace
the
was
put
first
on
the
program
and
men
struggled
for
the
best
places
and
the
best
view
of
the
infield
in
the
beginning
andy
drew
the
hs
sorrel
and
billy
roberts
the
blue
roan
gopher
the
yellowstone
man
got
a
sulky
little
buckskin
that
refused
to
add
one
whit
to
the
excitement
so
that
he
was
put
back
and
another
one
brought
this
other
proved
to
be
the
brown
which
andy
had
ridden
the
first
day
only
this
day
the
brown
was
in
different
mood
and
pitched
so
viciously
that
gopher
lost
control
in
the
changes
and
rode
wild
being
all
over
the
horse
and
everywhere
but
on
the
ground
he
did
not
pull
leather
however
though
he
was
accused
by
some
of
riding
on
his
spurs
at
the
last
at
any
rate
andy
and
billy
roberts
felt
that
the
belt
lay
between
themselves
and
admitted
as
much
privately
you
sure
got
to
ride
like
a
wild
man
if
yuh
beat
me
to
it
grinned
billy
by
gracious
i
after
it
like
a
wolf
myself
andy
retorted
yuh
know
how
i
fixed
i
just
got
to
have
it
bill
billy
going
out
to
ride
made
no
reply
except
a
meaning
and
billy
certainly
rode
that
day
for
the
blue
roan
did
his
worst
and
his
best
to
describe
the
performance
however
would
be
to
invent
many
words
to
supply
a
dearth
in
the
language
billy
rode
the
blue
roan
back
to
the
corral
and
he
had
broken
none
of
the
stringent
rules
of
the
contest
which
is
saying
much
for
billy
when
andy
went
out
shot
out
one
might
say
on
the
sorrel
the
happy
family
considered
him
already
beaten
because
of
the
remarkable
riding
of
billy
when
the
sorrel
began
pitching
the
gaping
populace
grown
wise
overnight
in
these
things
said
that
he
was
which
he
was
not
he
fought
as
some
men
fight
with
brain
as
well
as
muscle
cunningly
malignantly
he
would
stop
and
stand
perfectly
still
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
spring
viciously
whichever
way
would
seem
to
him
most
unexpected
for
he
was
not
bucking
from
fright
as
most
horses
do
but
because
he
hated
men
and
would
do
them
injury
if
he
could
when
the
crowd
thought
him
worn
out
so
that
he
stood
with
head
drooping
all
that
andy
would
permit
then
it
was
that
andy
grew
most
wary
it
was
as
he
had
said
of
a
sudden
straight
into
the
air
leaped
the
sorrel
reared
and
went
backward
in
a
flash
of
red
but
as
he
went
his
rider
slipped
to
one
side
and
when
he
struck
the
ground
andy
struck
also
on
his
feet
get
up
darn
yuh
he
muttered
and
when
the
sorrel
gathered
himself
together
and
jumped
up
he
was
much
surprised
to
find
andy
in
the
saddle
again
then
it
was
that
the
hs
sorrel
went
mad
and
pitched
as
he
had
never
even
when
building
his
record
pitched
before
then
it
was
that
andy
his
own
temper
a
bit
roughened
by
the
murderous
brute
rode
as
he
had
not
ridden
for
many
a
day
down
in
the
saddle
his
quirt
keeping
time
with
the
jumps
he
was
just
settling
himself
to
drag
it
out
of
him
proper
when
one
of
the
judges
on
horseback
in
the
field
threw
up
his
hand
get
off
he
shouted
galloping
closer
that
horse
got
to
be
rode
again
you
done
enough
this
time
so
andy
watching
his
chance
jumped
off
when
the
sorrel
stopped
for
a
few
seconds
of
breath
and
left
him
unconquered
and
more
murderous
than
ever
a
man
with
a
megaphone
was
announcing
that
the
contest
was
yet
undecided
and
that
green
and
roberts
would
ride
again
later
in
the
afternoon
andy
passed
the
happy
family
head
in
air
stopped
a
minute
to
exchange
facetious
threats
with
billy
roberts
and
went
with
irish
to
roost
upon
the
fence
near
the
judge
stand
to
watch
the
races
the
happy
family
kept
sedulously
away
from
the
two
and
tried
to
grow
interested
in
other
things
until
the
final
test
it
came
when
billy
roberts
again
first
mounted
the
hs
sorrel
still
in
murderous
mood
and
but
little
the
worse
for
his
previous
battle
what
he
had
done
with
andy
he
repeated
and
added
much
venom
to
the
repetition
again
he
threw
himself
backward
which
billy
expected
and
so
got
clear
and
remounted
as
he
scrambled
up
after
that
the
sorrel
simply
pitched
so
hard
and
so
fast
that
he
loosened
billy
a
bit
not
much
but
enough
to
show
daylight
between
rider
and
saddle
for
two
or
three
high
crooked
jumps
one
stirrup
he
lost
rode
a
jump
without
it
and
by
good
luck
regained
it
as
it
flew
against
his
foot
it
was
great
riding
and
a
gratifying
roar
of
applause
swept
out
to
him
when
it
was
over
andy
saddling
the
blue
roan
drew
a
long
breath
this
one
ride
would
tell
the
tale
and
he
was
human
enough
to
feel
a
nervous
strain
such
as
had
not
before
assailed
him
it
was
so
close
now
and
it
might
soon
be
so
far
a
bit
of
bad
luck
such
as
may
come
to
any
man
however
great
his
skill
and
the
belt
would
go
to
billy
but
not
for
long
could
doubt
or
questioning
hold
andy
green
he
led
the
weaver
out
himself
and
instinctively
he
felt
that
the
horse
remembered
him
and
would
try
all
that
was
in
him
also
he
was
somehow
convinced
that
the
blue
roan
held
much
in
reserve
and
that
it
would
be
a
great
fight
between
them
for
mastery
when
he
gathered
up
the
reins
the
roan
eyed
him
wickedly
sidelong
and
tightened
his
muscles
as
it
were
for
the
struggle
andy
turned
the
stirrup
put
in
his
toe
and
went
up
in
a
flash
warned
by
something
in
the
blue
roan
watchful
eye
like
a
flash
the
blue
roan
also
went
up
but
andy
had
been
a
fraction
of
a
second
quicker
there
was
a
squeal
that
carried
to
the
grand
stand
as
the
weaver
and
with
red
flaring
nostrils
pounded
the
sod
with
high
jumps
changed
and
took
to
weaving
till
one
wondered
how
he
kept
his
footing
more
particularly
how
andy
contrived
to
sit
there
riding
easily
the
roan
tiring
of
that
began
swapping
ends
furiously
and
so
fast
one
could
scarce
follow
his
jumps
andy
with
a
whoop
of
pure
defiance
yanked
off
his
hat
and
beat
the
roan
over
the
head
with
it
yelling
taunting
words
and
contemptuous
and
for
every
shout
the
weaver
bucked
harder
and
higher
bawling
like
a
calf
men
who
knew
good
riding
when
they
saw
it
went
silly
and
yelled
and
yelled
those
who
did
not
know
anything
about
it
caught
the
infection
and
roared
the
judges
galloped
about
backing
away
from
the
living
whirlwind
and
yelling
with
the
rest
came
a
lull
when
the
roan
stood
still
because
he
lacked
breath
to
continue
and
the
judges
shouted
an
uneven
chorus
get
down
the
belt
yours
or
words
to
that
effect
it
was
unofficial
that
verdict
but
it
was
unanimous
and
voiced
with
enthusiasm
andy
turned
his
head
and
smiled
acknowledgment
all
right
but
wait
till
i
tame
this
hoss
proper
him
and
i
got
a
point
to
settle
he
dug
in
his
spurs
and
again
the
battle
raged
and
again
the
crowd
not
having
heard
the
unofficial
decision
howled
and
yelled
approval
of
the
spectacle
not
till
the
roan
gave
up
completely
and
owned
obedience
to
rein
and
voiced
command
did
andy
take
further
thought
of
the
reward
he
satisfied
himself
beyond
doubt
that
he
was
master
and
that
the
weaver
recognized
him
as
such
he
wheeled
and
turned
cutting
out
an
imaginary
animal
from
an
imaginary
herd
he
loped
and
he
walked
stopped
dead
still
in
two
jumps
and
started
in
one
he
leaned
and
ran
his
gloved
hand
forgivingly
along
the
slatey
blue
neck
reached
farther
and
pulled
facetiously
the
roan
ears
and
the
roan
meekly
permitted
the
liberties
he
half
turned
in
the
saddle
and
slapped
the
plump
hips
and
the
weaver
never
moved
why
you
an
little
hoss
praised
andy
slapping
again
and
again
the
decision
was
being
bellowed
from
the
megaphone
and
andy
hearing
it
thus
officially
trotted
over
to
where
a
man
was
holding
out
the
belt
that
proclaimed
him
champion
of
the
state
andy
reached
out
a
hand
for
the
belt
buckled
it
around
his
middle
and
saluted
the
grand
stand
as
he
used
to
do
from
the
circus
ring
when
one
andré
de
grenó
had
performed
his
most
difficult
feat
the
happy
family
crowded
up
shamefaced
and
manfully
willing
to
own
themselves
wrong
we
down
and
ready
to
be
walked
on
by
the
champion
weary
announced
quizzically
mama
mine
but
yuh
sure
can
ride
andy
looked
at
them
grinned
and
did
an
exceedingly
foolish
thing
just
to
humiliate
happy
jack
who
he
afterwards
said
still
looked
unconvinced
he
coolly
got
upon
his
feet
in
the
saddle
stood
so
while
he
saluted
the
happy
family
mockingly
lighted
the
cigarette
he
had
just
rolled
then
with
another
derisive
salute
turned
a
double
somersault
in
the
air
and
lighted
upon
his
feet
and
the
roan
did
nothing
more
belligerent
than
to
turn
his
head
and
eye
andy
suspiciously
by
gracious
maybe
you
fellows
some
day
own
up
yuh
do
know
it
all
he
cried
and
led
the
weaver
back
into
the
corral
and
away
from
the
whooping
maniacs
across
the
track
andy
the
liar
andy
green
licked
a
cigarette
into
shape
the
while
he
watched
with
unfriendly
eyes
the
shambling
departure
of
their
guest
i
believe
the
darned
old
reprobate
was
lyin
to
us
he
remarked
when
the
horseman
disappeared
into
a
coulee
you
sure
ought
to
be
qualified
to
recognize
the
symptoms
grunted
cal
emmett
kicking
his
foot
out
of
somebody
carelessly
coiled
rope
on
the
ground
that
your
rope
happy
no
wonder
you
always
on
the
bum
for
one
if
you
try
tying
it
on
your
saddle
aw
that
there
andy
rope
if
you
look
at
my
saddle
you
find
my
rope
right
where
it
belongs
andy
retorted
i
ai
sheepherder
enough
to
leave
it
kicking
around
under
foot
that
rope
belongs
to
his
nibs
that
just
rode
off
when
he
caught
up
his
horse
again
after
dinner
he
throwed
his
rope
down
while
he
saddled
up
and
then
went
off
and
forgot
it
he
was
easy
in
his
mind
that
jasper
was
i
do
go
very
high
on
that
tale
he
told
i
know
the
boy
he
had
wolfing
with
him
last
winter
and
he
was
the
kind
to
pull
out
with
all
the
stuff
he
could
get
his
hands
on
he
was
an
fellow
and
if
been
any
rusty
work
done
down
there
in
the
breaks
this
mark
done
it
he
was
lying
somebody
laughed
suddenly
and
another
chuckle
helped
to
point
the
joke
until
the
whole
outfit
was
in
an
uproar
for
of
all
the
men
who
had
slept
under
tents
and
eaten
beside
the
andy
green
was
conceded
to
be
the
greatest
the
most
shameless
and
wholly
incorrigible
liar
of
the
lot
aw
yuh
do
want
to
get
jealous
of
an
old
stiff
like
that
pink
soothed
musically
there
ai
one
of
us
but
what
knows
you
could
lie
faster
and
farther
and
more
of
it
in
a
minute
with
your
tongue
around
your
palate
and
the
language
barred
than
any

a

shot

him

glared
at
those
who
gurgled
incredulously
and
went
on
no
sir
you
bet
it
ai
any
josh
with
me
time
that
old
gazabo
had
something
heavy
on
his
conscience
and
knowing
the
fellow
he
had
reference
to
i
sure
believe
he
lied
a
whole
lot
when
he
said
dan
pulled
out
with
all
the
stuff
they
got
together
and
went
down
river
maybe
he
went
down
river
all
right
but
if
he
did
it
was
most
likely
to
be
dan
was
as
honest
a
boy
as
there
is
in
the
country
and
he
had
money
on
him
that
he
got
mining
down
in
the
little
rockies
last
summer
i
know
because
he
showed
me
the
stuff
last
fall
when
i
met
him
in
benton
and
he
was
fixing
to
winter
with
this
fellow
that
just
left
dan
was
kinda
queer
about
some
things
and
one
of
was
about
money
it
never
made
any
difference
how
much
or
how
little
he
had
he
always
packed
it
in
his
clothes
said
a
bank
had
busted
on
him
once
and
left
him
broke
in
the
middle
uh
winter
and
he
was
going
to
let
it
happen
again
he
never
gambled
none
nor
blowed
his
money
any
farther
than
a
couple
uh
glasses
uh
beer
once
in
a
while
he
was
one
uh
these
saving
cusses
but
he
was
honest
i
know
that
for
a
fact
so
he
had
all
this
money
on
him
and
went
down
there
with
this
jasper
that
he
got
in
with
somehow
and
did
know
much
about
and
they
wolfed
all
winter
according
to
all
accounts
and
must
uh
made
quite
a
stake
the
way
the
bounty
runs
up
these
days
and
here
comes
this
darned
siwash
hiking
out
uh
there
fast
as
he
can
and
if
he
had
run
slap
onto
us
at
this
crossing
i
gamble
he
never
uh
showed
up
at
camp
at
all
but
kept
right
on
going
we
did
ask
him
no
questions
did
we
but
he
goes
to
all
the
pains
uh
telling
us
his
tale
uh
woe
about
how
dan
had
robbed
him
and
pulled
out
down
river
if
that
was
the
case
would
he
be
apt
to
hike
out
after
him
and
try
and
get
back
his
stuff
and
would
how
much
money
did
this
friend
uh
yours
have
queried
jack
bates
innocently
well
when
i
seen
him
in
benton
he
had
somewhere
between
six
and
seven
hundred
dollars
he
got
it
all
changed
into
bills
oh
golly
jack
bates
rolled
over
in
disgust
andy
losing
his
grip
why
darn
yuh
if
you
was
in
a
normal
lying
condition
make
it
ten
thousand
at
the
lowest
and
i
seen
the
time
when
uh
said
fifty
thousand
and
you
uh
made
us
swallow
the
load
too
buck
up
and
do
a
good
stunt
andy
or
else
keep
still
why
happy
jack
could
tell
that
big
a
lie
aw
gwan
happy
jack
rose
up
to
avenge
the
insult
yuh
compare
me
to
andy
green
i
ai
a
liar
and
i
can
lick
the
darned
that
calls
me
one
i
ai
and
yuh
ca
say
i
am
unless
yuh
lie
andy
calm
down
urged
weary
pacifically
jack
said
yuh
lie
he
did
say
by
gracious
you
think
i
was
necked
up
with
a
whole
bunch
uh
george
washingtons
growled
andy
and
what
gets
me
is
that
i
tell
the
truth
as
often
as
anybody
in
the
outfit
oftener
than
some
i
could
mention
but
that
ai
the
point
i
telling
the
truth
now
when
i
say
somebody
ought
to
hike
down
to
their
camp
and
see
what
this
old
skunk
has
done
with
dan
i
bet
money
you
find
him
sunk
in
the
river
or
cached
under
a
or
something
like
that
if
kept
his
face
closed
i
would
uh
give
it
a
second
thought
but
the
more
i
think
uh
the
story
he
put
up
the
more
i
believe
something
wrong
he
made
way
with
dan
somehow
and
yes
sure
thing
drawled
pink
wickedly
let
organize
a
searching
party
and
go
down
there
and
investigate
it
only
about
a
three
or
four
days
trip
through
the
roughest
country
the
lord
ever
stood
on
end
to
cool
and
then
forgot
till
it
crumpled
down
in
spots
and
got
set
that
way
so
he
just
left
it
go
and
mixed
fresh
mud
for
the
job
he
was
working
on
andy
lead
us
down
there
and
we
find
his
friend
dan
buried
in
a
tomato
can
maybe
supplied
jack
bates
by
golly
i
bet
yuh
put
friend
dan
into
one
slim
burst
out
by
golly
never
met
up
with
no
dan
that
packed
bills
around
in
his
andy
telling
the
truth
he
says
so
reproved
weary
and
when
andy
says
a
thing
is
the
truth
yuh
always
know
it
ai
cal
emmett
finished
the
sentence
but
weary
paid
no
what
to
expect
cadwolloper
right
and
we
ought
to
go
down
there
and
make
a
hunt
for
friend
dan
and
his
bills
how
many
were
there
did
yuh
say
you
go
to
the
devil
snapped
andy
getting
up
determinedly
yuh
bite
quick
enough
when
anybody
throws
a
load
at
yuh
that
would
choke
a
rhinoscerous
but
plain
truth
seems
to
be
too
much
for
the
weak
heads
of
yuh
i
guess
i
have
to
turn
loose
and
so
yuh
listen
to
me
there
something
crooked
about
this
deal
we
all
thought
it
sounded
that
way
weary
remarked
mildly
and
if
yuh
did
go
down
to
where
them
two
wintered
you
find
out
right
but
yuh
wo
and
that
old
cutthroat
will
get
off
with
the
murder
and
the
money
do
he
lie
natural
queried
jack
bates
solemnly
that
was
too
much
andy
glared
angrily
at
the
group
picked
up
the
wolfer
rope
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
off
to
where
his
horse
was
tied
got
on
him
and
rode
away
without
once
looking
back
though
he
knew
quite
well
that
they
were
watching
every
move
he
made
it
did
not
help
to
smooth
his
temper
that
the
sound
of
much
laughing
followed
him
as
he
swung
into
the
trail
taken
by
the
man
who
had
left
not
long
before
where
he
went
that
afternoon
when
for
some
reason
sufficient
for
the
foreman
who
was
chip
bennett
the
flying
u
roundup
crew
lay
luxuriously
snoring
in
the
shade
instead
of
riding
hurriedly
and
hotly
the
high
divides
no
one
but
andy
himself
knew
they
talked
about
him
after
he
left
and
told
one
another
how
great
a
liar
he
was
and
how
he
could
help
it
because
he
was
born
that
way
and
how
you
could
hardly
help
believing
him
they
recalled
joyously
certain
of
his
fabrications
that
had
passed
into
the
history
of
the
flying
u
and
wondered
what
josh
he
was
trying
to
spring
this
time
what
we
ought
to
do
advised
cal
is
to
lead
him
on
and
let
him
lie
his
darndest
and
make
out
we
believe
him
and
then
we
can
give
him
the
laugh
good
and
plenty
and
maybe
cure
him
cure
nothing
exclaimed
jack
bates
getting
up
because
the
sun
had
discovered
him
and
going
over
to
the
where
a
bit
of
shade
had
been
left
unoccupied
about
the
only
way
to
cure
andy
of
lying
is
to
kill
him
he
was
working
his
way
up
to
some
big
josh
and
if
yuh
let
him
alone
you
find
out
what
it
is
all
right
i
would
worry
none
about
it
if
i
was
you
to
prove
that
he
did
not
worry
jack
immediately
went
to
sleep
such
being
the
attitude
of
the
happy
family
when
andy
rode
hurriedly
into
camp
at
sundown
his
horse
wet
to
the
tips
of
his
ears
with
sweat
they
sat
up
expectancy
writ
large
upon
their
faces
no
one
said
anything
however
while
andy
unsaddled
and
came
over
to
beg
a
belated
supper
from
the
cook
nor
yet
while
he
squatted
on
his
heels
beside
the
and
ate
hungrily
he
seemed
somewhat
absorbed
in
his
thoughts
and
they
decided
mentally
that
andy
was
a
good
actor
and
that
if
they
were
not
dead
next
to
him
and
his
particular
weakness
they
would
swallow
his
yarn
whole
whatever
it
was
a
glow
was
in
the
sky
to
the
west
and
it
lighted
andy
face
queerly
like
a
vivid
blush
on
the
face
of
a
girl
andy
scraped
his
plate
thoughtfully
with
his
knife
looked
into
his
stirred
the
dregs
absently
and
dipped
out
half
a
spoonful
of
undissolved
sugar
which
he
swallowed
meditatively
he
tossed
plate
cup
and
spoon
toward
the
dishpan
sent
knife
and
fork
after
them
and
got
out
his
smoking
material
and
the
happy
family
grouped
rather
closely
together
and
watching
unobtrusively
stirred
to
the
listening
point
the
liar
was
about
to
lie
talk
about
a
guilty
conscience
giving
a
man
dead
away
andy
began
quite
unconscious
of
the
mental
attitude
of
his
fellows
and
forgetting
also
his
anger
of
the
afternoon
it
sure
does
work
out
like
that
sometimes
i
followed
that
old
devil
just
out
uh
curiosity
to
see
if
he
headed
for
dry
lake
like
he
said
he
was
going
did
have
any
reason
for
keeping
cases
on
him
or
suspicioning
anything
but
he
acted
like
we
was
all
out
on
his
trail
the
fool
i
kinda
had
a
hunch
that
if
he
had
been
up
to
any
deviltry
it
would
show
on
him
when
he
left
here
and
i
was
plumb
right
about
it
he
went
all
straight
enough
till
he
got
down
into
black
coulee
and
right
there
it
looked
like
he
got
kinda
panicky
and
suspicious
for
he
turned
square
off
the
trail
and
headed
up
the
coulee
he
must
uh
had
weary
commented
quite
as
if
he
believed
yuh
wait
till
i
through
andy
advised
still
wholly
unconscious
of
their
disbelief
yuh
was
all
kinda
skeptical
when
i
told
yuh
he
had
a
guilty
conscience
but
i
was
right
about
it
and
come
mighty
near
laying
out
on
the
range
with
my
toes
pointing
straight
up
just
because
you
fellows
would
asked
pink
coming
closer
his
eyes
showing
purple
in
the
softened
light
no
yuh
wait
now
till
i
tell
yuh
whereupon
andy
smoked
relishfully
and
in
silence
and
from
the
tail
of
his
eye
watched
his
audience
squirm
with
impatience
a
man
gets
along
a
whole
lot
better
without
any
conscience
he
began
at
last
irrelevantly
if
he
wants
to
be
mean
i
trailed
this
jasper
up
the
coulee
and
out
on
the
bench
across
that
level
strip
between
black
coulee
and
dry
spring
gulch
and
down
the
gulch
a
mile
or
so
he
was
fogging
right
along
and
seemed
as
if
he
looked
back
every
ten
rods
i
know
he
spotted
me
just
as
i
struck
the
level
at
the
head
uh
black
coulee
because
he
acted
different
then
i
could
see
he
was
making
across
country
for
the
trail
to
chinook
but
i
wanted
to
overhaul
him
and
have
a
little
casual
talk
about
dan
i
do
suppose
yuh
noticed
i
took
his
rope
along
i
wanted
some
excuse
for
hazing
after
him
like
that
yuh
see
uh
course
such
accommodating
cusses
as
you
would
be
none
strange
to
him
fleered
cal
well
he
never
found
out
what
i
was
after
sighed
andy
it
my
fault
i
did
come
up
with
him
and
my
intentions
were
peaceful
and
innocent
but
do
yuh
know
what
happened
he
got
out
uh
sight
down
dry
spring
gulch
yuh
know
where
that
rock
sticks
out
and
the
trail
makes
a
short
turn
around
it
that
where
i
lost
sight
of
him
but
he
was
very
far
in
the
lead
and
i
was
dead
anxious
to
give
him
his
rope
so
i
loped
on
down
you
were
taking
long
chances
that
mighty
rough
going
along
there
hinted
chip
gravely
sure
i
was
andy
agreed
easily
but
yuh
recollect
i
was
in
a
hurry
so
i
just
rounded
the
elephant
head
when
something
spats
the
rock
just
over
my
right
shoulder
and
my
horse
squatted
down
on
his
rump
and
said
he
gone
far
enough
i
kinda
felt
the
same
way
about
it
so
when
he
wheeled
and
humped
himself
back
up
the
trail
i
did
argue
none
with
him
there
was
silence
so
deep
one
could
hear
the
cropping
the
thick
grasses
along
the
creek
if
this
were
true
this
tale
that
andy
was
telling
the
happy
family
half
tempted
to
believe
glanced
furtively
at
one
another
aw
gwan
it
was
the
familiar
protesting
croak
of
happy
jack
what
did
yuh
turn
tail
for
why
did
yuh
have
it
out
with
him
the
happy
family
drew
a
long
breath
and
the
temptation
to
believe
was
pushed
aside
because
my
gun
was
rolled
up
in
my
bed
andy
replied
simply
i
ai
as
brave
as
you
are
happy
i
ai
got
the
nerve
to
ride
right
up
on
a
man
that
scared
plumb
silly
and
pumping
lead
my
way
fast
as
he
can
work
the
lever
on
his
rifle
and
lick
him
with
my
fists
till
he
howls
and
then
throw
him
and
walk
up
and
down
his
person
and
flap
my
wings
and
crow
it
awful
to
have
to
confess
it
but
i
willing
to
run
from
any
man
that
shooting
at
me
when
i
ca
shoot
back
give
a
lot
to
be
as
brave
as
you
are
happy
happy
jack
growled
and
subsided
well
by
golly
there
times
when
be
justified
in
shooting
yuh
but
i
do
see
what
want
to
do
it
for
objected
slim
guilty
conscience
i
told
yuh
retorted
andy
he
seen
i
was
chasing
him
up
and
i
guess
he
thought
it
was
somebody
that
had
got
next
to
what
happened
lord
i
wish
i
knew
what
did
happen
down
there
in
the
breaks
boys
andy
got
up
and
stood
looking
earnestly
down
at
them
in
the
twilight
you
ca
make
me
believe
that
there
has
been
a
murder
done
that
fellow
has
been
up
to
something
or
he
would
be
acting
so
damn
queer
and
if
it
was
just
plain
stealing
dan
would
sure
be
hot
on
his
trail
because
dan
thought
more
of
his
money
than
most
men
do
of
their
wives
it
was
about
all
he
lived
for
and
he
was
any
coward
that
old
man
never
would
get
it
off
him
without
a
big
ruction
and
if
he
did
dan
would
be
right
after
him
a
wolf
there
something
wrong
you
take
my
word
what
do
yuh
want
us
to
do
about
it
it
was
chip
who
asked
the
question
and
his
tone
was
quite
calm
and
impersonal
andy
looked
at
him
reproachfully
do
what
is
there
to
do
except
go
down
there
and
see
if
we
can
find
that
out
we
can
put
the
sheriff
wise
and
let
him
do
the
rest
it
sure
does
seem
kinda
tough
if
a
man
can
do
a
murder
and
robbery
and
get
off
with
it
just
because
nobody
cares
enough
about
it
to
head
him
off
the
happy
family
stirred
uneasily
of
course
it
was
all
just
a
josh
of
andy
but
he
was
such
a
convincing
liar
almost
they
felt
guilty
of
criminal
negligence
that
they
did
not
at
once
saddle
up
and
give
chase
to
the
murderer
who
had
tried
to
kill
andy
for
following
him
and
who
was
headed
for
chinook
after
unnecessarily
proclaiming
himself
bound
for
dry
lake
do
you
want
the
whole
outfit
to
turn
out
asked
chip
calmly
at
last
say
is
it
anywheres
near
that
prehistoric
castle
you
found
once
ping
asked
maliciously
unbelief
getting
strong
hold
of
him
again
andy
turned
toward
him
scowling
no
it
ai
he
snapped
and
you
fellows
can
back
up
and
snort
all
yuh
darn
please
and
make
idiots
of
yourselves
but
yuh
ca
do
any
business
making
me
out
a
peddler
on
deal
i
stand
pat
just
where
i
stood
at
first
and
it
take
a
lot
uh
cackling
to
make
me
back
down
that
old
devil
lie
about
dan
and
he
did
take
a
shot
at
me
he
took
yuh
for
a
most
likely
explained
jack
bates
he
did
need
no
field
glass
to
see
you
was
a
suspicious
character
by
golly
chortled
slim
he
thought
yuh
was
after
what
little
your
friend
dan
had
overlooked
chances
is
added
cal
emmett
did
the
fog
roll
down
and
hide
the
horrible
sight
asked
jack
bates
that
and
much
more
brought
about
a
distinct
coldness
between
the
happy
family
and
one
andy
green
so
that
the
sun
went
down
upon
wrath
and
rose
to
find
it
still
bubbling
hotly
in
the
outraged
heart
of
him
it
was
jack
bates
who
precipitated
an
open
war
by
singing
an
adapted
version
of
massa
in
the
cold
cold
ground
just
when
they
were
eating
breakfast
as
an
alleged
musical
effort
it
was
bad
enough
but
as
a
personal
insult
it
was
worse
one
hesitates
to
repeat
the
doggerel
even
in
an
effort
to
be
exact
however
the
chorus
bellowed
shamelessly
by
jack
was
this
down
in
the
hear
that
awful
sound
andy
green
is
there
jack
bates
got
no
further
than
that
for
andy
first
threw
his
plate
at
jack
and
then
landed
upon
him
with
much
force
and
venom
so
that
jack
went
backwards
and
waved
long
legs
convulsively
in
the
air
and
the
happy
family
stood
around
and
howled
their
appreciation
of
the
spectacle
when
it
dawned
upon
them
that
andy
was
very
much
in
earnest
and
that
his
fist
was
landing
with
unpleasant
frequency
just
where
it
was
most
painful
to
receive
it
they
separated
the
two
by
main
strength
and
argued
loudly
for
peace
but
andy
was
thoroughly
roused
and
would
have
none
of
it
and
hurled
at
them
profanity
and
insulting
epithets
so
that
more
than
jack
bates
looked
upon
him
with
unfriendly
eyes
and
said
things
which
were
not
calculated
to
smooth
roughened
tempers
that
now
quelled
chip
laying
detaining
hand
upon
the
nearest
who
happened
to
be
andy
himself
you
sound
like
a
bunch
of
old
women
what
do
you
want
to
do
the
worst
and
quickest
andy
and
i
do
mean
killing
off
any
of
these
alleged
joshers
either
andy
clicked
his
teeth
together
swallowed
hard
and
slowly
unclenched
his
hands
and
grinned
but
the
grin
was
not
altogether
a
pleasant
one
and
the
light
of
battle
still
shone
in
the
big
gray
eyes
of
him
you
the
boss
he
said
but
if
yuh
do
like
my
plans
just
have
one
less
to
pay
wages
to
what
i
going
to
do
is
throw
my
saddle
on
my
private
horse
and
ride
down
into
the
and
see
for
myself
how
the
cards
lay
maybe
it
awful
funny
to
the
rest
of
yuh
but
i
takin
it
kinda
serious
myself
and
i
going
to
find
out
how
about
it
before
i
through
i
ca
seem
to
think
it
a
josh
when
some
old
mark
makes
a
play
like
that
fellow
did
and
tries
to
put
a
bullet
into
my
carcass
for
riding
the
same
trail
he
took
it
me
for
the
and
you
can
think
what
yuh
damn
please
about
it
chip
stood
quite
still
till
he
was
through
and
eyed
him
sharply
you
better
take
old
buck
to
pack
your
blankets
and
grub
he
told
him
in
a
tone
we
be
swinging
down
that
way
in
two
or
three
days
by
next
saturday
you
find
us
camped
at
the
mouth
of
coulee
if
nothing
happens
that
give
you
four
days
to
prowl
around
come
on
boys
we
got
a
big
circle
ahead
of
us
this
morning
and
it
going
to
be
hot
enough
to
singe
the
tails
off
our
cayuses
by
noon
that
of
course
settled
the
disturbance
and
set
the
official
seal
of
approval
upon
andy
going
for
chip
was
too
wise
to
permit
the
affair
to
grow
serious
and
perhaps
lose
a
man
as
good
as
andy
family
quarrels
had
not
been
entirely
unknown
among
the
boys
of
the
flying
u
and
with
tact
they
never
had
been
more
than
a
passing
unpleasantness
so
that
although
jack
bates
swore
vengeance
and
nursed
sundry
bruised
spots
on
his
face
and
though
andy
saddled
packed
old
buck
with
his
blankets
and
meager
camp
outfit
and
rode
off
sullenly
with
no
word
to
anyone
and
only
a
scowling
glance
or
two
for
farewell
chip
mounted
and
rode
cheerfully
away
at
the
head
of
his
happy
family
worrying
not
at
all
over
the
outcome
i
got
half
a
notion
that
andy
was
telling
the
truth
after
all
he
remarked
to
weary
when
they
were
well
away
from
camp
it
worth
taking
a
chance
on
anyhow
and
when
he
comes
back
things
will
be
smooth
again
when
saturday
came
and
brought
no
andy
to
camp
the
happy
family
began
to
speculate
upon
his
absence
when
sunday
circle
took
them
within
twelve
or
fifteen
miles
of
the
camp
in
the
pink
suddenly
proposed
that
they
ride
down
there
and
see
what
was
going
on
he
wo
be
looking
for
us
he
explained
to
hide
a
secret
uneasiness
and
if
he
there
we
can
find
out
what
the
josh
is
if
he
ai
we
have
it
on
him
good
and
strong
i
betche
andy
just
wanted
a
and
took
that
way
uh
getting
it
declared
happy
jack
pessimistically
i
betche
he
in
town
right
now
tearing
things
wide
open
and
tickled
to
think
he
do
have
to
ride
in
this
hot
sun
yuh
ca
never
tell
what
andy
got
cached
up
his
sleeve
chip
thinks
he
was
talking
on
the
level
weary
mused
maybe
he
was
as
happy
says
yuh
ca
tell
as
always
before
this
brought
the
happy
family
to
argument
which
lasted
till
they
neared
the
deep
lonely
coulee
where
according
to
andy
friend
dan
had
wintered
with
the
old
man
now
how
the
mischief
do
we
get
down
questioned
jack
bates
complainingly
this
is
bound
to
be
the
right
place
there
the
cabin
over
there
against
the
cottonwoods
aw
come
on
back
urged
happy
jack
viewing
the
steep
bluff
with
disfavor
chances
is
andy
in
town
right
now
he
ai
down
there
old
buck
over
there
by
the
creek
pink
announced
i
know
him
far
as
i
could
see
him
let
ride
around
that
way
there
sure
to
be
a
trail
down
he
started
off
and
they
followed
him
dispiritedly
for
the
heat
was
something
to
remember
afterwards
with
a
shudder
here
the
place
pink
called
back
to
them
after
some
minutes
of
riding
andy
horse
is
down
there
too
but
i
do
see
andy
chances
is
began
happy
jack
but
found
no
one
listening
it
would
be
impossible
to
ride
down
so
they
dismounted
and
prepared
for
the
scramble
they
could
see
buck
packed
as
if
for
the
homeward
trail
and
they
could
see
andy
horse
saddled
and
feeding
with
reins
dragging
he
looked
up
at
them
and
whinnied
and
the
sound
but
accentuated
the
loneliness
of
the
place
buck
too
saw
them
and
came
toward
them
whinnying
wistfully
but
though
they
strained
eyes
in
every
direction
they
could
see
nothing
of
the
man
they
sought
it
was
significant
of
their
apprehension
that
not
even
happy
jack
made
open
comment
upon
the
strangeness
of
it
instead
they
dug
bootheels
deep
where
the
slope
was
loose
gravel
and
watched
that
their
horses
did
not
slide
down
upon
them
climbed
over
rocks
where
the
way
was
barred
and
prayed
that
horse
and
man
might
not
break
a
leg
they
had
been
over
rough
spots
and
had
climbed
in
and
out
of
deep
coulees
but
never
had
they
travelled
a
rougher
trail
than
that
my
god
boys
look
down
there
pink
cried
when
yet
fifty
perpendicular
feet
lay
between
them
and
the
level
below
they
looked
and
drew
breath
sharply
huddled
at
the
very
foot
of
the
last
and
worst
slope
lay
andy
and
they
needed
no
words
to
explain
what
had
happened
it
was
evident
that
he
had
started
to
climb
the
bluff
and
had
slipped
and
fallen
to
the
bottom
and
from
the
way
he
was
lying
the
happy
family
shut
out
the
horror
of
the
thought
and
hurried
recklessly
to
the
place
it
was
pink
who
with
a
last
slide
and
a
stumbling
recovery
at
the
bottom
reached
him
first
it
was
jack
bates
who
came
a
close
second
and
helped
to
turn
him
for
he
had
fallen
partly
on
his
face
from
the
way
one
arm
was
crumpled
back
under
him
they
knew
it
to
be
broken
further
than
that
they
could
only
guess
and
hope
while
they
were
feeling
for
the
others
came
down
and
crowded
close
pink
looked
up
at
them
strainedly
oh
for
god
sake
some
of
yuh
get
water
he
cried
sharply
what
good
do
yuh
think
you
doing
just
standing
around
we
ought
to
be
hung
for
letting
him
come
down
here
alone
weary
repented
it
ai
safe
for
one
man
in
this
cursed
country
he
hurt
cadwolloper
how
in
hell
do
know
anxiety
ever
sharpened
the
tongue
of
pink
if
somebody
bring
some
water
happy
gone
and
there
ai
a
drop
uh
whisky
in
the
crowd
ca
we
get
him
into
the
shade
this
damned
sun
is
enough
to
look
out
how
yuh
lift
him
man
you
ai
wrassling
a
calf
remember
you
take
his
shoulder
jack
yuh
damned
awkward
here
comes
happy
with
his
hat
full
do
slosh
it
all
on
at
once
a
little
at
a
time
better
get
some
on
his
head
so
with
much
incoherence
and
with
everybody
giving
orders
and
each
acting
independently
they
bore
him
tenderly
into
the
shade
of
a
rock
and
worked
over
him
feverishly
their
faces
paler
than
his
when
he
opened
his
eyes
and
stared
at
them
dully
they
could
have
shouted
for
very
relief
when
he
closed
them
again
they
bent
over
him
solicitously
and
dripped
more
water
from
the
hat
of
happy
jack
and
not
one
of
them
but
remembered
remorsefully
the
things
they
had
said
of
him
not
an
hour
before
the
things
they
had
said
even
when
he
was
lying
there
alone
and
hurt
hurt
unto
death
for
all
they
knew
when
he
was
roused
enough
to
groan
when
they
moved
him
however
gently
they
began
to
consider
the
problem
of
getting
him
to
camp
and
they
cursed
the
long
hot
miles
that
lay
between
they
tried
to
question
him
but
if
he
understood
what
they
were
saying
he
could
not
reply
except
by
moaning
which
was
not
good
to
hear
all
that
they
could
gather
was
that
when
they
moved
his
body
in
a
certain
way
the
pain
of
it
was
unbearable
also
he
would
faint
when
his
head
was
lowered
or
even
lifted
above
the
level
they
must
guard
against
that
if
they
meant
to
get
him
to
camp
alive
we
have
to
carry
him
up
this
cussed
hill
and
then
if
he
could
ride
at
all
we
might
make
it
the
chances
is
he
die
on
the
road
croaked
happy
jack
tactlessly
and
they
scowled
at
him
for
voicing
the
fear
they
were
trying
to
ignore
they
had
been
trying
not
to
think
that
he
might
die
on
the
road
and
they
had
been
careful
not
to
mention
the
possibility
as
it
was
no
one
answered
how
they
ever
got
him
to
the
top
of
that
heartbreaking
slope
not
one
of
them
ever
knew
twice
he
fainted
outright
and
happy
jack
carefully
bearing
his
hat
full
of
water
for
just
that
emergency
slipped
and
spilled
the
whole
of
it
just
when
they
needed
it
most
at
the
last
it
was
as
if
they
carried
a
dead
man
between
them
jack
bates
and
cal
emmett
it
was
who
bore
him
up
the
last
steep
climb
and
pink
and
weary
coming
behind
with
all
the
horses
glanced
fearfully
into
each
other
eyes
and
dared
not
question
at
the
top
they
laid
him
down
in
the
grass
and
swore
at
happy
jack
because
they
must
do
something
and
because
they
dared
not
face
what
might
be
before
them
they
avoided
looking
at
one
another
while
they
stood
helplessly
beside
the
still
figure
of
the
man
they
had
maligned
if
he
died
they
would
always
have
that
bitter
spot
in
their
memory
and
even
with
the
fear
of
his
dying
they
stood
remorseful
of
a
sudden
andy
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
them
with
the
light
of
recognition
and
they
bent
eagerly
toward
him
if
yuh
could
on
my
horse
i
i
could
ride
maybe
much
pain
it
cost
him
they
knew
by
the
look
on
his
face
but
he
was
game
to
the
last
just
as
they
knew
he
would
be
yuh
could
ride
twister
yuh
know
yuh
could
pink
objected
gently
but
if
yuh
could
ride
jack
horse
he
dead
gentle
and
we
help
hold
yuh
on
do
you
think
yuh
could
andy
moved
his
head
uneasily
i
i
got
to
he
retorted
weakly
and
even
essayed
a
smile
to
reassure
them
i
ai
all
in
yet
he
added
with
an
evident
effort
and
the
happy
family
gulped
sympathetically
and
wondered
secretly
if
they
would
have
such
nerve
under
like
conditions
it
going
to
be
one
hell
of
a
trip
for
yuh
weary
murmured
commiseratingly
when
they
were
lifting
him
into
the
saddle
of
a
truth
it
did
seem
absolutely
foolhardy
to
attempt
it
but
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
unless
they
left
him
there
for
no
wagon
could
possibly
be
driven
within
miles
of
the
place
andy
leaned
limply
over
the
his
face
working
with
the
agony
he
suffered
somehow
they
had
got
him
upon
the
horse
of
jack
bates
but
they
had
felt
like
torturers
while
they
did
it
and
the
perspiration
on
their
faces
was
not
all
caused
by
heat
my
god
i
rather
be
hung
than
go
through
this
again
muttered
cal
white
under
the
tan
i
i
tackle
it
now
gasped
andy
with
a
pitiful
attempt
to
sit
straight
in
the
saddle
get
on
boys
reluctantly
they
started
to
obey
when
the
horse
of
jack
bates
gave
a
sudden
leap
ahead
many
hands
reached
out
to
grasp
him
by
the
bridle
but
they
were
a
shade
too
late
and
he
started
to
run
with
andy
swaying
in
the
saddle
while
they
gazed
horrified
he
straightened
convulsively
turned
his
face
toward
them
and
raised
a
hand
caught
his
hat
by
the
brim
and
swung
it
high
above
his
head
much
obliged
boys
he
yelled
derisively
i
sure
do
appreciate
being
packed
up
that
hill
it
was
too
blamed
hot
to
walk
say
if
you
gone
around
that
bend
you
uh
found
a
good
trail
down
yuh
struck
about
the
worst
place
there
is
i
ai
all
in
yet
he
galloped
away
while
the
happy
family
stared
after
him
with
bulging
eyes
the
gasped
weary
weakly
and
started
for
his
horse
darn
yuh
you
all
in
when
we
get
hold
of
yuh
screamed
jack
bates
and
gave
chase
it
was
when
they
were
tearing
headlong
after
him
down
the
coulee
rim
and
into
a
shallow
gully
which
seamed
unexpectedly
the
level
that
they
saw
his
horse
swerve
suddenly
and
go
bounding
along
the
edge
of
the
slope
with
andy
sawing
energetically
upon
the
bit
what
trick
he
up
to
now
cried
cal
emmett
resentfully
feeling
that
in
the
light
of
what
had
gone
before
andy
could
not
possibly
make
a
single
motion
in
good
faith
andy
brought
his
horse
under
control
and
turned
back
to
meet
them
and
the
happy
family
watched
him
guardedly
until
they
reached
the
gulley
and
their
own
horses
took
fright
at
a
dark
shambling
object
that
scuttled
away
down
toward
the
andy
was
almost
upon
them
before
they
could
give
him
any
attention
did
you
see
it
he
called
excitedly
it
was
a
bear
and
he
was
digging
at
something
under
that
shelving
rock
come
on
and
let
take
a
look
aw
gwan
happy
jack
adjured
crossly
he
was
thinking
of
all
the
water
he
had
carried
painstakingly
in
his
hat
for
the
relief
of
this
conscienceless
young
reprobate
and
he
was
patently
suspicious
of
some
new
trick
well
by
gracious
andy
rode
quite
close
dangerously
close
considering
the
mood
they
were
in
and
eyed
them
queerly
i
sure
must
have
a
horrible
rep
when
yuh
wo
believe
your
own
eyes
just
because
i
happen
to
remark
that
a
bear
is
a
bear
i
call
it
a
pinto
hog
if
it
make
yuh
feel
any
better
and
i
say
it
was
doing
any
digging
only
i
going
down
there
and
take
a
look
there
an
odor
there
was
and
they
could
not
deny
it
even
though
andy
did
make
the
assertion
and
though
they
had
threatened
much
that
was
exceedingly
unpleasant
and
what
they
would
surely
do
to
andy
if
they
ever
got
him
within
reach
they
followed
him
quite
peaceably
they
saw
him
get
off
his
horse
and
stand
looking
down
at
something
and
there
was
that
in
his
attitude
which
made
them
jab
spurs
against
their
horses
flanks
a
moment
later
they
too
were
looking
down
at
something
and
they
were
not
saying
a
word
it
dan
all
right
said
andy
at
last
and
his
tone
was
hushed
i
hunted
the
coulee
over
every
foot
of
it
and
looked
up
some
of
the
little
draws
and
went
along
the
river
but
i
could
find
any
trace
of
him
i
never
thought
about
coming
up
here
look
there
his
head
was
smashed
in
with
a
rock
or
something
ugh
here
let
me
away
boys
this
thing
he
walked
uncertainly
away
and
sat
down
upon
a
rock
with
his
face
in
his
hands
and
what
they
could
see
of
his
face
was
as
white
as
the
tan
would
permit
somehow
not
a
man
of
them
doubted
him
then
and
not
a
man
of
them
but
felt
much
the
same
they
backed
away
and
stood
close
to
where
andy
was
sitting
you
would
believe
me
when
i
told
yuh
he
reproached
when
the
sickness
had
passed
and
he
could
lift
his
head
and
look
at
them
you
thought
i
was
lying
and
yuh
made
yourselves
pretty
blamed
obnoxious
to
me
but
i
got
even
for
there
was
much
satisfaction
in
his
tone
and
the
happy
family
squirmed
yuh
see
i
was
telling
the
truth
all
right
and
now
i
going
to
get
even
some
more
i
going
to
take
er
pink
along
for
a
witness
and
notify
the
outfit
that
yuh
wo
be
back
for
a
day
or
two
and
send
word
to
the
sheriff
and
you
jaspers
can
have
the
pleasure
uh
standing
guard
over
he
shivered
a
little
and
turned
his
glance
quickly
away
and
i
hope
he
added
maliciously
as
he
mounted
his
own
horse
you
make
jack
bates
stand
an
guard
by
his
high
lonesome
he
sure
got
it
coming
to
him
with
pink
following
close
at
his
heels
he
rode
away
up
the
ridge
say
there
grub
enough
on
old
buck
to
do
yuh
he
called
down
to
them
in
case
chip
do
send
yuh
any
till
he
waved
a
subdued
farewell
and
turned
his
face
again
up
the
ridge
and
before
they
had
quite
decided
what
to
do
about
it
he
was
gone
wolf
wolf
andy
green
of
the
flying
u
loped
over
the
grassy
level
and
hummed
a
tune
as
he
rode
the
sun
shone
just
warm
enough
to
make
a
man
feel
that
the
world
was
good
enough
for
him
and
the
wind
was
just
a
lazy
whispering
element
to
keep
the
air
from
growing
absolutely
still
and
stagnant
there
was
blue
sky
with
white
fluffy
bits
of
cloud
like
torn
cotton
drifting
as
lazily
as
the
wind
and
there
were
singing
and
swaying
and
range
cattle
with
their
calves
midway
to
weaning
time
not
often
may
one
ride
leisurely
afar
on
so
perfect
a
day
and
while
andy
was
a
fellow
at
all
times
on
such
a
day
he
owned
not
a
care
a
mile
farther
and
he
rode
over
a
low
shoulder
of
the
butte
he
was
passing
ambled
down
the
long
slope
on
the
far
side
crossed
another
rounded
hill
followed
down
a
dry
at
the
foot
of
it
sought
with
his
eye
for
a
practicable
crossing
and
went
headlong
down
a
steep
bank
rattled
the
loose
rocks
in
the
dry
narrow
channel
and
went
forging
up
a
bank
steeper
than
the
first
with
creaking
and
grunting
horse
and
struck
again
easy
going
she
slipped
on
me
he
murmured
easily
meaning
the
saddle
riding
on
your
tail
just
about
but
i
guess
we
can
stand
it
the
rest
uh
the
why
all
right
if
he
had
not
been
so
lazy
and
he
would
have
stopped
right
there
and
reset
the
saddle
but
if
he
had
he
might
have
missed
something
which
he
liked
to
live
over
o
nights
he
went
up
a
gentle
rise
riding
slowly
because
of
the
saddle
passed
over
the
ridge
and
went
down
another
short
slope
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
cuddled
against
another
hill
stood
a
low
cabin
with
rusty
rising
aslant
from
one
corner
this
was
the
spot
he
had
been
aiming
for
and
he
neared
it
slowly
it
was
like
a
dozen
other
log
cabins
tucked
away
here
and
there
among
the
foothills
of
the
bear
paws
it
had
an
air
of
rakish
hominess
as
if
it
would
be
a
fine
snuggy
place
in
winter
when
the
snow
and
the
wind
swept
the
barren
land
around
in
the
summer
it
stood
and
with
all
the
litter
of
bachelor
belongings
scattered
about
or
hanging
from
pegs
on
the
wall
outside
there
was
a
faint
trail
of
smoke
from
the
rusty
pipe
and
it
brought
a
grunt
of
satisfaction
from
andy
he
home
all
right
and
if
he
do
throw
together
some
uh
them
biscuits
uh
his
there
be
something
happen
hope
the
full
yuh
lazy
old
skate
he
slapped
the
lightly
down
the
flanks
of
his
horse
and
went
at
a
trot
around
the
end
of
the
cabin
and
there
he
was
so
utterly
taken
by
surprise
that
he
almost
pulled
his
mount
into
a
sitting
posture
a
young
woman
was
stooping
before
the
open
door
and
she
was
pouring
something
from
a
white
earthen
bowl
into
a
battered
tin
pan
two
lambs
a
black
one
and
a
white
were
standing
on
their
knees
in
their
absorption
and
were
noisily
drinking
of
the
stuff
as
fast
as
it
came
within
reach
andy
had
half
a
minute
in
which
to
gaze
before
the
young
woman
looked
up
said
oh
in
a
breathless
sort
of
way
and
retreated
to
the
doorstep
where
she
stood
regarding
him
inquiringly
andy
feeling
his
face
go
unreasonably
red
lifted
his
hat
he
knew
that
she
was
waiting
for
him
to
speak
but
he
could
not
well
say
any
of
the
things
he
thought
and
blurted
out
an
utterly
idiotic
question
what
are
yuh
feeding
the
girl
looked
down
at
the
bowl
in
her
hands
and
laughed
a
little
rolled
oats
she
answered
boiled
very
thin
and
with
condensed
cream
added
to
taste
good
morning
she
seemed
about
to
disappear
and
that
brought
andy
to
his
senses
he
was
not
as
a
rule
a
bashful
young
man
good
morning
is
er
johnson
at
home
he
came
near
saying
but
caught
himself
in
time
johnson
was
what
men
called
the
man
whom
andy
had
ridden
over
to
see
upon
a
more
or
less
trivial
matter
he
is
but
he
will
be
back
if
you
care
to
wait
she
spoke
with
a
certain
preciseness
which
might
be
natural
or
artificial
and
she
stood
in
the
doorway
with
no
symptoms
of
immediate
disappearance
andy
slid
over
a
bit
in
the
saddle
readjusted
his
hat
so
that
its
brim
would
shield
his
eyes
from
the
sunlight
and
prepared
to
be
friendly
oh
i
wait
he
said
easily
i
got
all
the
time
there
is
would
you
mind
if
i
smoked
a
cigarette
indeed
i
was
wishing
you
would
she
told
him
with
surprising
frankness
i
so
longed
to
see
a
dashing
young
cowboy
roll
a
cigarette
with
deft
white
fingers
andy
glancing
at
her
startled
spilled
much
tobacco
down
the
front
of
him
stopped
to
brush
it
away
and
let
the
lazy
breeze
snatch
the
tiny
oblong
of
paper
from
between
his
unwatchful
fingers
of
course
she
was
joshing
him
he
thought
uneasily
as
he
separated
the
leaves
of
his
cigarette
book
by
blowing
gently
upon
them
and
singled
out
another
paper
are
yuh
so
new
to
the
country
that
it
anything
of
a
treat
he
asked
guardedly
yes
i
new
i
what
you
people
call
a
pilgrim
do
you
do
it
with
one
hand
i
thought
oh
yes
you
hold
the
reins
between
your
firm
white
teeth
while
you
roll
lady
i
never
travelled
with
no
show
andy
protested
mildly
and
untruthfully
she
just
joshing
or
did
she
know
any
better
she
looked
sober
as
anything
but
somehow
her
eyes
kind
of
you
see
i
know
some
things
about
you
those
are
chaps
heavens
she
called
them
the
way
they
are
spelled
without
the
soft
sound
of
s
that
you
wearing
for
trousers
andy
blushed
modestly
he
was
not
wearing
them
for
trousers
and
you
got
jingling
rowels
at
your
heels
and
those
are
taps
you
going
to
be
shy
a
yard
or
two
of
calico
if
that
black
has
his
andy
cut
in
remorselessly
and
hastily
made
and
lighted
his
cigarette
while
she
was
rescuing
her
blue
calico
skirt
from
the
jaws
of
the
black
lamb
and
puckering
her
eyebrows
over
the
chewed
place
when
her
attention
was
once
more
given
to
him
he
was
smoking
as
unobtrusively
as
possible
and
he
was
gazing
at
her
with
a
good
deal
of
speculative
admiration
he
looked
hastily
down
at
the
lambs
mary
had
little
lambs
he
murmured
inanely
they
not
mine
she
informed
him
taking
him
seriously
or
seeming
to
do
so
andy
had
some
trouble
deciding
just
how
much
of
her
was
sincere
they
were
here
when
i
came
and
i
ca
take
them
back
with
me
so
there
no
use
in
claiming
them
they
be
such
a
nuisance
on
the
train
i
reckon
they
would
andy
agreed
if
yuh
had
far
to
go
well
you
ca
call
san
jose
she
observed
meditatively
it
takes
four
days
to
come
you
a
long
way
from
home
does
it
are
yuh
homesick
ever
andy
was
playing
for
information
without
asking
directly
how
long
she
intended
to
stay
a
question
which
had
suddenly
seemed
quite
important
also
why
was
she
stopping
here
with
johnson
away
off
from
everybody
seeing
i
only
been
here
four
days
the
novelty
has
worn
off
yet
she
replied
but
it
does
seem
more
like
four
weeks
and
how
i
ever
stand
two
months
of
it
not
ever
seeing
a
soul
but
father
andy
looked
reproachful
and
also
glad
did
she
consider
him
a
soul
and
was
her
dad
to
be
sure
had
never
mentioned
having
a
daughter
but
then
in
the
men
do
go
around
yawping
their
personal
affairs
before
returned
andy
felt
that
he
had
accomplished
much
he
had
learned
that
the
young
woman
name
really
was
mary
and
that
she
was
a
stenographer
in
a
office
in
san
jose
where
her
mother
lived
that
the
confinement
of
had
threatened
her
with
pulmonary
tuberculosis
andy
failed
at
the
moment
to
recognize
the
disease
which
had
once
threatened
him
also
and
wondered
vaguely
and
that
the
doctor
had
advised
her
coming
to
montana
for
a
couple
of
months
that
she
had
written
to
her
father
it
seemed
queer
to
have
anyone
speak
of
old
as
father
and
that
he
had
told
her
to
come
she
told
andy
that
she
had
not
seen
her
father
for
five
years
andy
knew
that
had
disappeared
for
a
whole
winter
about
that
long
ago
and
that
no
one
had
discovered
where
he
went
because
he
and
her
mother
were
not
congenial
he
had
dismounted
at
her
invitation
and
had
gone
clanking
to
the
doorstep
and
sat
down
giving
a
furtive
kick
now
and
then
at
the
black
lamb
which
developed
a
fondness
for
the
leathern
fringe
on
his
chaps
and
had
eaten
an
orange
which
she
had
brought
in
her
trunk
all
the
way
from
san
jose
and
which
she
had
picked
from
a
tree
which
stood
by
her
mother
front
gate
he
had
nibbled
a
ripe
olive
eating
it
with
what
andy
himself
would
term
long
teeth
and
had
tried
hard
not
to
show
how
vile
he
found
it
he
had
inspected
two
which
she
had
found
last
at
monterey
and
had
dried
and
had
crumpled
a
withered
leaf
of
bay
in
his
hands
and
had
smelled
and
nearly
sneezed
his
head
off
and
had
cracked
and
eaten
four
walnuts
also
gathered
from
her
mother
yard
and
three
almonds
from
the
same
source
and
had
stared
admiringly
at
a
filled
with
funny
marks
which
she
called
shorthand
andy
had
told
her
his
name
and
the
name
of
the
outfit
he
worked
for
had
explained
what
he
meant
by
outfit
and
had
drawn
a
large
u
in
the
dirt
to
show
her
what
a
flying
u
was
and
had
wanted
to
murder
the
black
lamb
which
kept
getting
in
his
way
and
trying
to
eat
the
stick
andy
used
for
a
pencil
had
confessed
that
he
did
sometimes
play
cards
for
money
as
do
the
cowboys
in
western
stories
but
assured
her
that
he
had
never
killed
off
any
of
his
friends
during
any
little
disagreement
he
had
owned
to
drinking
a
glass
of
whisky
now
and
then
but
declared
that
it
was
only
for
snake
bite
and
did
not
happen
oftener
than
once
in
six
months
or
so
yes
he
had
often
had
rattlers
in
his
bed
but
not
to
hurt
this
is
where
he
began
to
inspect
the
and
so
turned
the
conversation
safely
back
to
california
and
himself
away
from
the
temptation
to
revel
in
fiction
all
of
which
took
time
so
that
came
before
they
quite
felt
a
longing
for
his
presence
and
though
the
sun
shone
straight
in
the
cabin
door
and
so
proved
that
it
was
full
noon
there
was
no
fire
left
in
the
stove
and
nothing
in
sight
that
was
eatable
save
another
ripe
olive
which
andy
had
politely
declined
and
two
more
almonds
and
an
orange
a
stenographer
with
a
fluffy
pompadour
that
dipped
distractingly
at
one
side
and
a
gold
watch
suspended
around
the
neck
like
a
locket
and
with
sleeves
that
came
no
farther
than
the
elbow
and
heels
higher
than
any
riding
boot
andy
ever
owned
in
his
life
and
with
teeth
that
were
very
white
and
showed
a
glint
of
gold
here
and
there
and
eyes
that
looked
at
one
with
insincere
gravity
and
fingers
with
nails
that
shone
fingers
that
pinched
red
lips
together
meditatively
a
stenographer
who
has
all
these
entrancing
attributes
andy
discovered
may
yet
lack
those
housewifely
accomplishments
that
make
a
man
dream
of
a
little
home
for
two
so
far
as
andy
could
see
her
knowledge
of
cookery
extended
no
farther
than
rolled
oat
porridge
for
the
two
lambs
it
was
who
whittled
shavings
and
started
the
fire
without
any
comment
upon
the
hour
or
his
appetite
who
went
to
the
spring
and
brought
water
the
enameled
teakettle
which
had
large
bare
patches
where
the
enamel
had
been
chipped
off
in
the
stress
of
baching
and
sliced
the
bacon
and
mixed
the
biscuits
to
be
sure
he
had
done
those
things
for
years
and
thought
nothing
of
it
andy
also
had
done
those
things
many
the
time
and
had
thought
nothing
of
it
either
but
to
do
them
while
a
young
woman
sits
calmly
by
and
makes
no
offer
of
help
but
talks
of
many
things
unconscious
even
of
her
feminine
duties
and
privileges
that
struck
andy
with
a
cold
breath
of
disillusionment
he
watched
her
unobtrusively
while
she
talked
she
never
once
seemed
to
feel
that
cooking
belonged
to
woman
and
as
far
as
he
could
see
did
not
feel
so
either
so
andy
mentally
adjusted
himself
to
the
novelty
and
joyed
in
her
presence
to
show
how
successful
was
his
mental
adjustment
it
is
necessary
merely
to
state
one
fact
where
he
had
intended
to
stop
an
hour
or
so
he
stayed
the
afternoon
ate
supper
there
and
rode
home
at
sundown
his
mind
a
jumble
of
sunny
californian
days
where
one
may
gather
and
oranges
bay
leaves
and
ripe
olives
at
will
and
of
black
and
white
lambs
which
always
obtrude
themselves
at
the
wrong
moment
and
break
off
little
intimate
confidences
about
life
in
a
office
perhaps
and
of
polished
that
never
dip
themselves
in
dishwater
andy
had
come
to
believe
that
it
would
be
neither
right
or
just
to
expect
them
to
do
so
common
a
thing
the
season
was
what
the
range
calls
between
roundups
so
that
andy
went
straight
to
the
ranch
and
found
the
happy
family
in
or
around
the
peacefully
enjoying
their
smoke
andy
among
other
positive
faults
and
virtues
did
not
lack
a
certain
degree
of
guile
men
there
were
at
the
flying
u
who
would
ride
in
haste
if
they
guessed
that
a
pompadoured
young
woman
from
california
was
at
the
end
of
the
trail
and
andy
knowing
well
the
reputation
he
bore
among
them
set
that
reputation
at
work
to
keep
the
trail
empty
of
all
riders
save
himself
when
someone
asked
him
idly
what
had
kept
him
so
long
he
gazed
around
at
them
with
his
big
innocent
gray
eyes
why
i
was
just
getting
acquainted
with
the
new
girl
he
answered
simply
and
truthfully
truth
being
something
which
the
happy
family
was
unaccustomed
to
from
the
lips
of
andy
green
they
sniffed
scornfully
what
girl
demanded
irish
bluntly
why
girl
his
young
lady
daughter
that
is
visiting
him
she
mighty
nice
and
she
got
style
about
her
and
she
was
feeding
two
lambs
her
name
he
added
softly
is
mary
since
no
one
had
ever
heard
that
had
a
daughter
the
happy
family
could
not
be
blamed
for
doubting
andy
they
did
doubt
profanely
and
volubly
say
did
any
of
you
fellows
ever
eat
a
ripe
olive
andy
broke
in
when
he
could
make
himself
heard
well
he
explained
mildly
when
came
another
rift
of
silence
in
the
of
words
when
yuh
ride
over
there
she
likely
give
yuh
one
to
try
but
yuh
take
my
advice
and
pass
it
up
i
went
up
against
one
and
i
ai
got
the
taste
out
uh
my
mouth
yet
it
sure
fierce
more
words
from
which
andy
gathered
that
they
did
not
believe
anything
he
said
that
he
was
wasting
time
and
breath
and
that
his
imagination
was
weak
and
his
lies
idiotic
he
better
not
let
hear
how
he
was
taking
his
name
in
vain
and
giving
him
a
daughter
and
so
on
say
did
yuh
ever
see
a
funniest
thing
yuh
ever
saw
all
pimply
and
pink
and
with
five
points
to
she
got
two
when
yuh
go
over
you
ask
her
to
let
yuh
see
andy
was
in
bed
then
and
he
spoke
through
the
dusk
toward
the
voices
what
those
voices
had
just
then
been
saying
seemed
to
have
absolutely
no
effect
upon
him
oh
dry
up
irish
commanded
impatiently
nobody
thinking
uh
riding
over
there
yuh
chump
what
kind
of
easy
marks
do
yuh
think
we
are
andy
laughed
audibly
in
his
corner
next
the
window
say
you
fellows
do
amuse
me
a
lot
by
gracious
i
bet
five
dollars
some
of
yuh
take
the
trail
over
there
soon
or
late
i
i
bet
five
dollars
to
that
yuh
do
the
bet
to
hold
good
for
well
say
six
weeks
but
yuh
better
not
take
me
up
boys
especially
irish
that
ai
got
a
girl
at
present
yes
or
of
yuh
by
gracious
it
be
a
case
for
for
any
one
uh
yuh
say
she
a
bird
got
goldy
hair
and
a
dimple
in
her
chin
and
eyes
that
make
a
man
with
much
reviling
they
accepted
the
wager
and
after
that
andy
went
peacefully
to
sleep
quite
satisfied
for
the
time
with
the
effect
produced
by
his
absolute
truthfulness
it
did
not
matter
much
he
told
himself
complacently
what
a
man
reputation
might
be
so
long
as
he
recognized
its
possibilities
and
shaped
his
actions
properly
it
is
true
that
when
he
returned
from
dry
lake
not
many
days
after
with
a
package
containing
four
new
ties
and
a
large
lustrous
silk
handkerchief
of
the
proper
creamy
tint
the
happy
family
seemed
to
waver
a
bit
when
he
took
to
shaving
every
other
day
and
became
extremely
fastidious
about
his
and
his
boots
and
the
knot
in
his
tie
and
when
he
polished
the
rowels
of
his
spurs
with
scouring
brick
which
patsy
never
used
and
was
careful
to
dent
his
into
four
mathematically
correct
dimples
before
ever
he
would
ride
away
from
the
ranch
the
happy
family
looked
thoughtful
and
discussed
him
privately
in
low
tones
but
when
andy
smilingly
assured
them
that
he
was
going
over
to
call
on
girl
and
asked
them
if
they
would
like
to
come
along
and
be
introduced
and
taste
a
ripe
olive
and
look
at
the
and
smell
a
crumpled
leaf
of
bay
they
backed
figuratively
from
the
wiles
of
him
and
asserted
more
or
less
emphatically
he
could
work
then
andy
would
grin
and
ride
gaily
away
and
flying
u
coulee
would
see
him
no
more
for
several
hours
it
was
mere
good
fortune
from
andy
viewpoint
that
duty
did
not
immediately
call
the
happy
family
singly
or
as
a
whole
to
ride
across
the
hills
toward
the
cabin
of
johnson
without
a
legitimate
excuse
he
felt
sure
of
their
absence
from
the
place
and
he
also
counted
optimistically
upon
their
refusing
to
ask
any
one
whom
they
might
meet
if
johnson
had
a
daughter
visiting
him
four
weeks
do
not
take
much
space
in
a
calendar
nor
much
time
to
live
yet
in
the
four
that
came
just
after
andy
discovery
he
accomplished
much
even
in
his
own
modest
reckoning
he
had
taught
the
girl
to
watch
for
his
coming
and
to
stand
pensively
in
the
door
with
many
messages
when
he
said
he
must
hit
the
trail
he
had
formed
definite
plans
for
the
future
and
had
promised
her
quite
seriously
that
he
would
cut
out
gambling
and
never
touch
liquor
in
any
form
unless
the
snake
was
a
big
one
and
sunk
his
fangs
in
a
vital
spot
in
which
dire
contingency
mary
absolved
him
from
his
vow
he
had
learned
the
funny
marks
that
meant
his
name
and
hers
in
shorthand
and
had
watched
with
inner
satisfaction
her
efforts
to
learn
how
to
fry
canned
corn
in
bacon
grease
and
to
mix
biscuits
that
were
neither
yellow
with
too
much
soda
nor
distressfully
soggy
with
too
little
and
had
sat
a
whole
blissful
afternoon
in
his
shirtsleeves
while
mary
bent
her
blond
pompadour
domestically
over
his
coat
sewing
in
the
that
are
prone
to
come
loose
and
torment
a
man
to
go
back
to
the
first
statement
which
includes
all
these
things
and
much
more
andy
had
in
those
four
weeks
accomplished
much
but
a
girl
may
not
live
forever
in
that
lonely
land
with
only
andy
green
to
discover
her
presence
and
the
rumors
which
at
first
buzzed
unheeded
in
the
ears
of
the
happy
family
stung
them
at
last
to
the
point
of
investigation
so
that
on
a
sunday
the
last
sunday
before
the
flying
u
wagons
took
again
to
the
trailless
irish
and
jack
bates
rode
surreptitiously
up
the
coulee
half
an
hour
after
andy
blithe
in
his
fancied
security
had
galloped
that
way
to
spend
a
long
with
mary
if
he
discovered
them
they
would
lose
a
dollar
each
but
if
they
discovered
a
girl
such
as
andy
had
pictured
they
felt
that
it
would
be
a
dollar
well
lost
in
the
many
strange
things
may
happen
irish
and
jack
pulled
up
short
when
off
to
their
right
in
a
particularly
lonely
part
of
that
country
broken
into
seamed
coulees
and
hills
they
heard
a
faint
halloo
with
spurs
pricking
deep
and
frequent
they
hurried
to
the
spot
looked
down
a
grassy
swale
and
saw
andy
lying
full
length
upon
the
ground
in
rather
a
peculiar
pose
while
his
horse
fed
calmly
a
away
they
stopped
and
looked
at
him
and
at
each
other
rode
cautiously
to
within
easy
rifle
shot
and
stopped
again
ai
yuh
getting
tired
feelings
kinda
unseasonable
in
the
day
jack
bates
called
out
guardedly
i
i
hurt
boys
andy
lifted
his
head
to
say
strainedly
my
hoss
stepped
in
a
hole
and
i
was
looking
for
it
i
guess
my
broke
jack
snorted
that
so
sure
it
ai
your
neck
now
seems
to
me
your
head
sets
kinda
crooked
better
feel
it
and
find
out
while
we
go
on
where
we
going
he
half
turned
his
horse
up
the
hill
again
resenting
the
impulse
which
had
betrayed
him
a
hand
breadth
from
the
trail
andy
waited
a
moment
then
on
the
dead
boys
my
leg
broke
like
you
bust
a
dry
stick
come
and
see
for
yourselves
maybe
irish
began
uncertainly
in
an
undertone
andy
voice
had
in
it
a
note
of
pain
that
was
rather
convincing
aw
he
just
trying
to
head
us
off
did
i
help
pack
him
up
that
ungodly
bluff
last
spring
thinking
he
was
going
to
die
before
we
got
him
to
the
top
and
him
riding
off
and
giving
us
the
to
pay
for
it
you
can
bite
if
yuh
want
to
i
going
on
i
sure
savvy
andy
green
come
and
look
andy
begged
from
below
if
i
joshing
you
can
josh
and
be
darned
finished
jack
for
him
i
do
pack
you
up
hill
more
than
once
we
going
to
call
on
your
when
yuh
get
good
and
refreshed
up
you
can
come
and
look
on
at
me
and
irish
acting
pretty
and
getting
a
irish
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
saw
andy
raise
his
head
and
gaze
after
them
saw
it
drop
upon
his
arms
just
before
they
went
quite
over
the
hill
the
sight
stuck
persistently
and
unpleasantly
in
his
memory
yuh
know
he
be
hurt
he
began
tentatively
when
they
had
ridden
slowly
a
hundred
yards
or
so
he
might
but
he
ai
he
up
to
some
game
again
and
he
like
anything
better
than
to
have
us
ride
down
there
and
feel
his
bones
if
you
been
along
that
day
in
the
you
know
the
kind
of
bluff
he
can
put
up
why
we
all
thought
sure
he
was
going
to
die
he
acted
that
natural
we
felt
like
we
was
packing
a
corpse
at
a
funeral
and
him
tickled
to
death
all
the
while
at
the
load
he
was
throwing
no
sir
yuh
do
see
me
swallowing
no
such
dope
as
any
more
when
he
gets
tired
uh
laying
there
he
recover
rapid
and
come
on
do
yuh
worry
none
about
andy
green
why
man
do
yuh
reckon
any
could
break
leg
a
rider
like
him
he
knows
more
ways
uh
falling
off
a
horse
without
losing
the
ashes
off
his
cigarette
than
most
men
know
how
to
how
to
punish
grub
andy
green
get
hurt
with
a
horse
if
he
could
he
uh
been
dead
and
playing
his
little
harp
long
ago
such
an
argument
was
more
convincing
than
the
note
of
pain
in
the
voice
of
andy
so
that
irish
shook
off
his
uneasiness
and
laughed
at
the
narrow
escape
he
had
from
being
made
a
fool
and
speedily
they
forgot
the
incident
it
was
who
made
them
remember
when
they
had
been
an
hour
or
so
basking
themselves
so
to
speak
in
the
smiles
of
mary
they
had
fancied
all
along
that
she
had
a
curiously
expectant
air
and
that
she
went
very
often
to
the
door
to
see
what
the
lambs
were
up
to
and
always
lifted
her
eyes
to
the
prairie
slope
down
which
they
had
ridden
and
gazed
as
long
as
she
dared
they
were
not
dull
they
understood
quite
well
what
lamb
it
was
that
held
half
the
mind
of
her
and
they
were
piqued
because
of
their
understanding
and
not
disposed
to
further
the
cause
of
the
absent
therefore
when
asked
casually
what
had
become
of
andy
jack
bates
moved
his
feet
impatiently
shot
a
sidelong
glance
at
the
girl
who
was
at
that
moment
standing
where
she
could
look
out
of
the
window
and
laughed
unpleasantly
oh
andy
been
took
again
with
an
attack
uh
bluff
he
answered
lightly
he
gets
that
way
ever
so
often
you
know
we
left
him
laying
in
a
sunny
spot
a
few
miles
back
trying
to
make
somebody
think
he
was
hurt
so
they
pack
him
home
and
he
have
the
laugh
on
them
for
all
summer
was
he
hurt
the
girl
turned
suddenly
and
her
voice
told
how
much
it
meant
to
her
but
jack
was
not
sympathetic
no
he
was
hurt
he
was
just
playing
off
he
got
us
once
that
way
and
he
never
given
up
the
notion
that
he
could
do
it
again
we
may
be
easy
but
i
do
understand
the
girl
broke
in
sharply
do
you
mean
that
he
would
deliberately
try
to
deceive
you
into
believing
he
was
hurt
when
he
was
miss
johnson
jack
replied
sorrowfully
he
would
he
would
lose
valuable
sleep
for
a
month
studying
up
the
smoothest
way
to
deceive
i
guess
he
added
artfully
and
as
if
the
subject
was
nearly
exhausted
yuh
do
know
green
very
well
i
remember
hearing
about
that
job
he
put
up
on
yuh
remarked
not
noticing
that
the
girl
lips
were
opened
for
speech
yuh
made
a
stretcher
did
yuh
and
no
he
told
it
that
way
but
he
such
a
liar
he
could
tell
the
truth
if
he
wanted
to
we
found
him
lying
at
the
bottom
of
a
steep
bluff
and
he
appeared
to
be
about
dead
it
looked
as
if
he
slipped
and
fallen
down
part
way
so
we
packed
water
and
sloshed
in
his
face
and
he
kinda
come
to
and
then
we
packed
him
up
the
bluff
and
yuh
know
what
the
is
like
it
was
unmerciful
hot
too
and
we
like
to
died
getting
him
up
at
the
top
we
laid
him
down
and
worked
over
him
till
we
got
him
to
open
his
eyes
and
he
could
talk
a
little
and
said
maybe
he
could
ride
if
we
could
get
him
on
a
horse
the
he
made
us
him
into
the
saddle
and
considering
the
size
of
him
it
was
something
of
a
contract
and
then
he
made
as
if
he
could
stay
on
even
but
first
we
knew
he
digs
in
the
spurs
yanks
off
his
hat
and
lets
a
yell
out
of
him
you
could
hear
a
mile
and
says
obliged
boys
it
was
too
blamed
hot
to
walk
up
that
hill
and
off
he
goes
stretched
his
legs
out
before
him
pushed
his
hands
deep
down
in
his
trousers
pockets
and
laughed
and
laughed
that
was
sure
one
on
you
he
chuckled
andy
a
hard
case
all
right
but
the
girl
stood
before
him
a
little
pale
and
with
her
chin
high
father
how
can
you
think
it
funny
she
cried
impatiently
it
seems
to
me
er
i
think
it
perfectly
horrid
for
a
man
to
act
like
that
and
you
say
bates
that
he
out
there
she
swept
a
very
pretty
hand
and
arm
toward
the
window
acting
the
same
silly
sort
of
falsehood
i
do
know
where
he
is
jack
answered
judicially
what
he
was
doing
when
we
came
past
she
went
to
the
door
and
stood
looking
vaguely
out
at
nothing
in
particular
and
irish
took
the
opportunity
to
kick
jack
on
the
and
viciously
whisper
yuh
damned
chump
but
jack
smiled
serenely
irish
he
reflected
had
not
been
with
them
that
day
in
the
and
so
had
not
the
same
cause
for
vengeance
he
remembered
that
irish
had
laughed
just
as
was
laughing
when
they
told
him
about
it
but
jack
had
never
been
able
to
see
the
joke
and
his
conscience
did
not
trouble
him
now
more
they
said
about
andy
green
he
and
with
irish
mostly
silent
and
with
the
girl
extremely
indignant
at
times
and
at
others
slightly
incredulous
but
always
eager
to
hear
more
more
they
said
not
with
malice
perhaps
for
they
liked
andy
green
but
with
the
spirit
of
reminiscence
strong
upon
them
many
things
that
he
had
said
and
done
they
recalled
and
laughed
over
but
the
girl
did
not
laugh
at
sundown
when
they
rode
away
she
scribbled
a
hasty
note
put
it
in
an
envelope
and
entrusted
it
to
irish
for
immediate
delivery
to
the
absent
and
erring
one
then
they
rode
home
promising
each
other
that
they
would
sure
devil
andy
to
death
when
they
saw
him
and
wishing
that
they
had
ridden
long
ago
to
the
cabin
of
it
was
not
pleasant
to
know
that
andy
green
had
again
fooled
them
completely
none
at
the
ranch
had
seen
andy
and
they
speculated
much
upon
the
nature
of
the
game
he
was
playing
happy
jack
wanted
to
bet
that
andy
really
had
broken
his
leg
but
that
was
because
he
had
a
present
grievance
against
irish
and
hated
to
agree
with
anything
he
said
but
when
they
went
to
bed
the
happy
family
had
settled
unanimously
upon
the
theory
that
andy
had
ridden
to
dry
lake
and
would
come
loping
serenely
down
the
trail
next
day
irish
did
not
know
what
time
it
was
when
he
found
himself
sitting
up
in
bed
listening
but
he
discovered
pink
getting
quietly
into
his
clothes
irish
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
felt
under
his
pillow
for
his
own
garments
long
habit
had
made
him
put
them
there
and
began
to
dress
i
guess
i
go
along
with
yuh
he
whispered
yuh
can
if
yuh
want
to
pink
answered
ungraciously
but
yuh
raise
the
long
howl
if
hold
on
boys
my
ante
on
the
table
came
guardedly
from
bunk
and
there
was
a
soft
shuffling
sound
as
of
moving
blankets
the
subdued
scrape
of
boots
pulled
from
under
bunks
and
the
quiet
searching
for
hats
and
gloves
there
was
a
clank
of
the
faint
squeal
of
a
hinge
gone
rusty
a
creak
of
a
loose
board
and
then
the
three
stood
together
outside
under
the
and
avoided
looking
at
one
another
without
a
word
they
went
down
the
path
to
the
big
gate
swung
it
open
and
headed
for
the
corral
where
slept
their
horses
if
them
do
wake
up
nobody
be
any
the
wiser
and
it
a
lovely
night
for
a
ramble
murmured
weary
consoling
himself
well
i
could
sleep
irish
confessed
half
defiantly
i
expect
it
just
a
big
josh
but
it
wo
do
any
hurt
to
make
sure
yuh
all
think
andy
green
lives
to
tell
lies
snapped
pink
throwing
the
saddle
on
his
horse
with
a
grunt
at
the
weight
of
it
the
horse
flinched
away
from
its
impact
and
pink
swore
at
it
viciously
yuh
might
uh
gone
down
and
made
sure
anyhow
he
criticised
well
i
was
going
to
but
jack
said
irish
stooped
to
pick
up
the
latigo
and
did
not
finish
but
i
ca
get
over
the
way
his
head
dropped
down
on
his
arms
when
we
were
riding
out
uh
sight
as
if
oh
hell
if
it
was
a
josh
i
just
about
beat
the
head
off
him
for
spoiling
my
sleep
this
way
get
your
foot
off
that
rein
yuh
damned
clumsy
bench
this
last
to
his
horse
they
rode
slowly
away
from
the
ranch
and
made
the
greater
haste
when
the
sound
of
their
galloping
could
not
reach
the
dulled
ears
of
those
who
slept
they
did
not
talk
much
and
when
they
did
it
was
to
tell
one
another
what
great
fools
they
were
but
even
in
the
telling
they
urged
their
horses
to
greater
speed
well
pink
summed
up
at
last
if
he
hurt
out
here
we
doing
the
right
thing
and
if
he
ai
he
wo
be
there
to
have
the
laugh
on
us
so
it
all
right
either
way
there
was
black
shadow
in
the
grassy
swale
where
they
found
him
his
horse
had
wandered
off
and
it
was
only
the
sure
instinct
of
irish
that
led
them
to
the
spot
where
he
lay
a
blacker
shadow
in
the
darkness
that
a
passing
cloud
had
made
just
at
first
they
thought
him
dead
but
when
they
lifted
him
he
groaned
and
then
spoke
it
one
on
me
this
time
he
said
and
the
throat
of
irish
pinched
achingly
together
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
which
had
in
it
the
note
of
pain
he
had
been
trying
to
forget
after
that
he
said
nothing
at
all
because
he
was
a
senseless
weight
in
their
arms
at
daylight
irish
was
pounding
vehemently
the
door
of
the
white
house
and
calling
for
the
little
doctor
andy
lay
stretched
unconscious
upon
the
porch
beside
him
and
down
in
the
the
happy
family
was
rubbing
eyes
and
exclaiming
profanely
at
the
story
pink
was
telling
and
here
finished
irish
a
couple
of
hours
later
when
he
was
talking
the
thing
over
with
the
little
doctor
here
a
note
girl
gave
me
for
him
i
do
reckon
there
any
good
news
in
it
so
maybe
yuh
better
hold
it
out
on
him
till
he
got
over
the
fever
i
guess
we
queered
andy
a
lot
but
i
ride
over
soon
as
i
can
and
fix
it
up
with
her
and
tell
her
he
broke
his
leg
all
right
maybe
he
finished
optimistically
she
come
over
to
see
him
irish
kept
his
word
though
he
delayed
until
the
next
day
and
the
next
day
it
was
too
late
for
the
cabin
of
was
closed
and
empty
and
the
black
lamb
and
the
white
were
nosing
unhappily
their
pan
of
mush
and
bleating
lonesomely
irish
waited
a
while
and
started
home
again
rode
into
the
trail
and
met
bert
rogers
who
explained
was
hauling
his
girl
trunk
and
all
to
the
depot
he
told
irish
i
met
just
this
side
the
lane
they
aimed
to
catch
the
afternoon
train
i
reckon
she
was
going
home
told
me
so
irish
rode
thoughtfully
back
to
the
ranch
and
went
straight
to
the
white
house
where
andy
lay
meaning
to
break
the
news
as
carefully
as
he
knew
how
andy
was
lying
in
bed
looking
at
the
ceiling
and
in
his
hand
was
the
note
he
turned
his
head
and
glanced
indifferently
at
irish
yuh
sure
made
a
good
job
of
it
did
yuh
he
began
calmly
though
it
was
not
the
calm
which
meant
peace
i
was
just
about
engaged
to
that
girl
if
it
do
yuh
any
good
to
know
how
nice
and
thorough
yuh
busted
everything
up
for
me
read
that
he
held
out
the
paper
and
irish
turned
a
guilty
red
when
he
took
it
green
i
have
just
been
greatly
entertained
with
the
history
of
your
very
peculiar
deeds
and
adventures
and
i
wish
to
say
that
i
have
discovered
myself
wholly
lacking
the
sense
of
humor
which
is
necessary
to
appreciate
you
as
i
am
going
home
this
is
my
only
opportunity
of
letting
you
know
how
thoroughly
i
detest
falsehood
in
form
yours
truly
mary
edith
johnson
ai
yuh
proud
andy
inquired
in
a
peculiar
tired
voice
maybe
i
a
horrible
liar
all
right
but
i
never
done
anybody
a
dirty
trick
like
that
irish
might
have
said
it
was
jack
bates
who
did
the
mischief
but
he
did
not
we
never
knew
it
was
anything
serious
he
explained
contritely
on
the
dead
i
sorry
and
that
does
a
damned
lot
uh
good
if
she
gone
andy
cut
in
miserably
oh
she
gone
all
right
she
went
murmured
irish
and
went
out
and
shut
the
door
softly
behind
him
fool
gold
andy
green
unshaven
as
to
face
and
haggard
as
to
eyes
leaned
upon
his
stout
willow
stick
and
looked
gloomily
away
to
the
west
he
was
a
good
deal
given
to
looking
to
the
west
these
days
when
a
leg
kept
him
at
the
ranch
though
habit
and
inclination
would
have
sent
him
riding
fast
and
far
over
prairies
untamed
inaction
comes
hard
when
a
man
has
lived
his
life
mostly
in
the
open
doing
those
things
which
keep
brain
and
muscle
keyed
alike
to
alertness
and
leave
no
time
for
brooding
if
andy
had
not
broken
his
leg
but
had
gone
with
the
others
on
roundup
he
would
never
have
spent
the
days
glooming
unavailingly
because
a
girl
with
a
blond
pompadour
and
teasing
eyes
had
gone
away
and
taken
with
her
a
false
impression
of
his
morals
and
left
behind
her
the
sting
of
a
harsh
judgment
against
which
there
seemed
no
appeal
as
it
was
he
spent
the
time
going
carefully
over
his
past
in
and
in
remembering
every
moment
that
he
had
spent
with
mary
johnson
in
those
four
weeks
when
she
stayed
with
her
father
and
petted
the
black
lamb
and
the
white
in
his
prejudiced
view
he
had
never
done
anything
to
make
a
girl
hate
him
he
had
not
always
told
the
truth
he
would
admit
that
with
candid
gray
eyes
looking
straight
into
your
own
but
he
had
never
lied
to
harm
a
man
which
it
seemed
to
him
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
if
he
could
once
have
told
her
how
he
felt
about
it
and
showed
her
how
the
wide
west
breeds
wider
morals
he
did
not
quite
know
how
you
would
put
these
things
but
he
felt
them
very
keenly
he
wanted
to
make
her
feel
the
difference
to
see
that
little
things
do
not
count
in
a
man
life
after
all
except
when
they
affect
him
as
a
man
when
big
things
are
wanted
of
him
a
little
cowardice
would
count
for
instance
because
it
would
show
that
the
man
would
fail
at
the
test
but
a
little
lie
just
a
harmless
sort
of
lie
that
was
only
a
josh
and
was
taken
as
such
by
one
fellows
andy
was
not
analytic
by
nature
and
he
would
have
stumbled
vaguely
among
words
to
explain
his
views
but
he
felt
very
strongly
the
injustice
of
the
condemnation
and
he
would
scarcely
speak
to
jack
bates
and
irish
when
they
came
around
making
overtures
for
peace
and
goodwill
if
she
had
gone
home
so
sudden
i
could
uh
squared
it
all
right
he
told
the
little
doctor
whenever
her
sympathetic
attitude
won
him
to
speech
upon
the
subject
yes
i
believe
you
could
she
would
agree
cheeringly
if
she
the
right
sort
and
cared
you
could
she
the
right
sort
i
know
that
andy
would
assert
with
much
decision
though
modesty
forbade
his
telling
the
little
doctor
that
he
was
also
sure
she
cared
she
did
care
if
a
girl
actions
count
for
anything
or
her
looks
and
smiles
of
course
she
cared
else
why
did
she
rush
off
home
like
that
a
good
month
before
she
had
intended
to
go
they
had
planned
that
andy
would
get
a
and
go
with
her
as
far
as
butte
because
she
would
have
to
wait
there
several
hours
and
andy
wanted
to
take
her
out
to
the
columbia
gardens
and
see
if
she
did
think
they
were
almost
as
nice
as
anything
california
could
show
then
she
had
gone
off
without
any
warning
because
jack
bates
and
irish
had
told
her
a
lot
of
stuff
about
him
andy
if
that
prove
she
cared
argued
andy
to
himself
what
the
dickens
would
you
want
for
proof
it
was
from
thinking
these
things
over
and
over
while
he
lay
in
bed
that
andy
formed
the
habit
of
looking
often
towards
the
west
when
his
hurt
permitted
him
to
hobble
around
the
house
and
when
a
man
looks
often
enough
in
any
direction
his
feet
will
unless
hindered
by
fate
itself
surely
follow
his
gaze
if
you
give
them
time
enough
it
was
the
excursion
rates
advertised
in
a
great
falls
paper
that
first
put
the
idea
consciously
into
the
brain
of
andy
they
seemed
very
cheap
and
the
was
generous
and
san
jose
was
not
very
far
from
san
francisco
the
place
named
in
the
advertisement
and
if
he
could
only
see
the
girl
and
explain
it
would
be
another
month
before
he
would
be
able
to
work
anyway
and
a
man
might
as
well
get
rid
of
a
hundred
or
so
travelling
as
to
sit
in
a
poker
game
and
watch
it
fade
away
and
he
would
really
get
more
out
of
it
anyhow
nobody
need
know
where
he
had
gone
they
could
think
he
was
just
going
to
butte
and
he
did
give
a
darn
if
they
did
find
it
out
he
limped
back
into
the
house
and
began
inspecting
with
much
dissatisfaction
his
wardrobe
he
would
have
to
stake
himself
to
new
clothes
but
he
needed
clothes
anyway
that
fall
he
could
get
what
he
wanted
in
butte
while
he
waited
for
the
train
to
ogden
now
that
andy
had
made
up
his
mind
to
go
he
was
in
a
great
hurry
and
grudged
the
days
even
the
hours
that
must
pass
before
he
could
see
mary
edith
johnson
not
even
the
little
doctor
knew
the
truth
when
andy
appeared
next
morning
dressed
for
his
journey
ate
a
hasty
and
unsatisfactory
breakfast
and
took
the
old
man
to
one
side
with
elaborate
carelessness
and
asked
for
a
sum
that
made
the
old
man
blink
but
no
man
might
have
charge
of
the
happy
family
for
long
without
attaining
that
state
of
mental
insulation
which
renders
a
shock
scientifically
impossible
the
old
man
wrote
a
check
twisted
his
mouth
into
a
whimsical
knot
and
inquired
mildly
what
the
brand
of
devilment
this
time
and
how
long
it
going
to
take
yuh
with
a
perceptible
emphasis
on
the
word
for
probably
the
first
time
in
his
life
andy
blushed
and
stammered
over
a
lie
and
before
he
had
got
out
more
than
two
words
the
old
man
seemed
to
understand
the
situation
quite
thoroughly
he
said
oh
i
see
well
git
a
ticket
and
be
dead
sure
yuh
do
the
limit
he
took
out
his
pipe
and
filled
it
meditatively
andy
blushed
again
six
weeks
indoors
had
lightened
the
tan
on
his
face
so
that
his
blushes
showed
very
plainly
and
made
desperate
denial
i
only
going
up
to
butte
but
a
fellow
ca
have
any
kind
of
a
time
there
without
a
roll
and
i
be
back
in
two
or
three
weeks
soon
as
my
leg
mended
thorough
i
get
along
with
yuh
growled
the
old
man
though
his
eyes
twinkled
doggone
it
do
yuh
lie
to
think
i
was
shipped
in
on
the
last
train
a
man
do
git
red
in
the
face
when
he
just
merely
headed
for
butte
why
doggone
yuh
the
last
words
had
to
serve
for
a
farewell
because
andy
was
limping
away
as
fast
as
he
could
and
did
not
come
back
to
the
house
again
he
did
not
even
tell
the
little
doctor
though
it
was
fifteen
minutes
before
john
wedum
the
ranchhand
had
the
team
ready
to
drive
andy
to
town
and
he
was
one
of
the
little
doctor
most
loyal
subjects
andy
walked
haltingly
down
a
street
in
san
jose
and
wondered
just
what
would
be
the
best
and
quickest
way
in
which
to
find
mary
edith
johnson
three
ways
were
open
to
him
he
could
hunt
up
all
the
johnsons
in
town
there
were
three
full
pages
of
them
in
the
directory
as
he
remembered
with
a
sigh
and
find
out
which
one
was
the
right
one
but
san
jose
as
he
had
already
discovered
was
not
a
village
and
he
doubted
if
he
could
stand
the
walking
he
could
visit
all
the
real
estate
offices
in
town
and
he
was
just
beginning
to
realize
that
there
were
almost
as
many
real
estate
offices
as
there
were
johnsons
and
he
could
promenade
the
streets
in
the
hope
of
meeting
her
but
always
there
was
the
important
fact
to
face
the
fact
that
san
jose
is
not
a
village
he
came
upon
a
particularly
shady
spot
and
a
bench
placed
invitingly
andy
sat
down
eased
the
leg
out
before
him
and
rolled
a
cigarette
this
is
going
to
be
some
different
from
hunting
a
stray
on
the
range
he
told
himself
with
an
air
of
deliberate
cheerfulness
if
i
could
get
out
and
scurrup
around
on
a
hoss
and
round
her
up
that
way
but
this
footing
it
all
over
town
is
what
grinds
me
he
drew
a
match
along
the
under
side
of
the
bench
and
held
the
blaze
absently
to
the
cigarette
there
was
one
thing
she
told
about
an
orange
tree
right
beside
her
mother
front
gate
maybe
he
looked
around
him
hopefully
just
across
the
street
was
a
front
gate
and
beside
it
an
orange
tree
he
knew
because
there
were
ripe
oranges
hanging
upon
it
he
started
to
rise
his
blood
jumping
queerly
sat
down
again
and
swore
every
darned
gate
in
town
just
about
has
got
an
orange
tree
stuck
somewhere
handy
by
i
remember
now
damn
three
cigarettes
he
smoked
while
he
sat
there
when
he
started
on
again
his
face
was
grimly
set
toward
the
nearest
business
street
at
the
first
sign
he
stopped
pulled
together
his
courage
and
went
in
a
girl
sat
in
a
corner
of
the
room
before
a
typewriter
andy
saw
at
a
glance
that
her
hair
was
too
dark
murmured
something
and
backed
out
at
the
next
place
a
man
was
crumpled
into
a
big
chair
reading
a
paper
behind
a
high
desk
a
typewriter
clicked
but
andy
could
not
see
the
operator
without
going
behind
the
railing
and
he
hesitated
looking
for
a
snap
asked
the
man
briskly
coming
up
from
his
crumpled
state
like
a
spring
well
i
was
looking
now
here
it
may
not
be
what
you
want
but
i
just
going
to
show
you
this
proposition
and
see
what
you
think
of
it
it
ai
going
to
last
somebody
goin
to
snap
it
up
before
you
know
it
now
here
it
was
half
an
hour
before
andy
got
away
from
that
office
and
he
had
not
seen
who
was
running
the
machine
behind
the
desk
even
then
he
had
however
spoken
rather
loudly
and
had
informed
the
man
that
he
was
from
montana
with
no
effect
whatever
upon
the
clicking
he
had
listened
patiently
to
the
glowing
description
of
several
good
buys
and
had
escaped
with
difficulty
within
ten
minutes
after
hearing
the
unseen
typist
addressed
as
fern
at
the
third
place
he
merely
looked
in
at
the
door
and
retreated
hastily
when
the
agent
like
a
spider
on
the
watch
started
forward
when
he
limped
into
the
office
of
his
hotel
at
six
andy
was
ready
to
swear
that
every
foot
of
land
in
california
was
for
sale
and
that
every
man
in
san
jose
was
trying
his
best
to
sell
it
and
looked
upon
him
andy
green
as
a
millionaire
who
might
be
induced
to
purchase
he
had
not
visited
all
the
places
where
they
kept
covered
with
yellowed
placards
abounding
in
large
type
and
many
fat
exclamation
points
and
the
word
only
with
a
dollar
mark
immediately
after
all
he
had
not
visited
half
of
them
or
a
third
that
night
he
dreamed
feverishly
of
modern
cottages
with
bath
and
of
only
down
and
balance
payable
monthly
and
of
ranches
and
ranches
he
who
had
been
used
to
numbering
acres
by
the
thousand
and
to
whom
the
word
ranch
meant
miles
of
wire
fencing
and
beyond
that
miles
of
open
it
took
all
the
longing
he
felt
for
mary
johnson
to
drive
him
out
the
next
morning
and
to
turn
his
face
toward
those
placarded
places
which
infested
every
street
but
he
went
he
went
with
eyes
that
glared
hostility
at
every
man
who
said
buy
and
with
chin
set
to
stubborn
purpose
he
meant
to
find
mary
edith
johnson
and
he
meant
to
find
her
without
all
california
knowing
that
he
was
looking
for
her
not
once
had
he
mentioned
her
name
or
showed
that
he
cared
whether
there
was
a
typewriter
in
the
office
or
whether
it
was
a
girl
man
or
chinaman
who
clicked
the
keys
and
yet
he
knew
exactly
how
every
girl
typist
had
her
hair
dressed
and
what
was
the
color
of
her
eyes
at
two
andy
stopped
suddenly
and
stared
down
at
a
crack
in
the
pavement
and
his
lips
moved
in
muttered
speech
she
worked
three
years
in
one
of
them
places
and
she
detests
falsehood
in
form
hell
is
exactly
what
he
was
saying
out
loud
on
one
of
the
busiest
streets
in
san
jose
a
policeman
glanced
at
him
looked
again
and
came
slowly
toward
him
andy
took
the
hint
and
moved
on
decorously
to
the
next
but
the
revelation
that
had
come
to
him
there
in
the
street
dulled
somewhat
his
alertness
so
that
he
came
near
committing
himself
to
the
purchase
of
one
of
those
ubiquitous
modern
cottages
with
bath
before
he
realized
what
he
was
doing
and
fled
to
the
street
again
on
the
pretense
that
he
had
to
catch
the
car
which
was
just
slowing
down
for
that
crossing
he
boarded
the
car
though
he
had
no
idea
of
where
it
was
going
and
fished
in
his
pocket
for
a
nickel
and
just
when
he
was
reaching
up
from
the
step
where
he
stood
clinging
reaching
over
the
hat
of
a
girl
to
place
the
nickel
in
the
outstretched
palm
of
the
conductor
he
heard
for
the
first
time
in
many
weeks
the
name
of
mary
johnson
a
girl
at
his
elbow
was
asking
the
other
the
become
of
mary
johnson
she
was
to
the
dance
last
night
and
the
first
one
andy
held
his
breath
oh
mame
quit
her
place
with
kelly
and
gray
two
weeks
ago
gone
to
santa
cruz
and
got
a
place
for
the
summer
her
and
lola
parsons
went
together
and
andy
took
advantage
of
another
crossing
and
dropped
off
he
wanted
to
find
out
when
the
next
train
left
for
santa
cruz
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
there
might
be
two
mary
johnsons
in
the
world
which
was
fortunate
perhaps
he
wasted
no
time
in
hesitation
and
so
within
twenty
minutes
he
was
hearing
the
wheels
of
a
fast
train
go
over
the
switches
in
the
suburbs
of
san
jose
and
he
was
asking
the
conductor
what
time
the
train
would
reach
santa
cruz
and
was
getting
snubbed
for
his
anxiety
santa
cruz
when
he
did
reach
it
seemed
on
a
superficial
examination
to
be
almost
as
large
as
san
jose
and
the
offices
closer
together
and
even
more
plentifully
supplied
with
modern
cottages
and
bath
and
the
heart
of
him
sank
prophetically
for
the
first
time
since
he
dropped
off
the
in
san
jose
it
seemed
to
him
that
mary
johnson
was
quite
as
far
off
quite
as
unattainable
as
she
had
ever
been
he
walked
slowly
up
pacific
avenue
and
watched
the
hurrying
crowds
and
wondered
if
chance
would
be
kind
to
him
if
he
should
meet
her
on
the
street
perhaps
he
did
not
want
to
canvass
all
the
offices
in
town
it
would
take
me
till
snow
flies
he
murmured
dispiritedly
forgetting
that
here
was
a
place
where
snow
never
flew
and
sought
a
hotel
where
they
were
not
full
to
the
eaves
as
two
complacent
clerks
had
already
told
him
at
supper
he
made
friends
with
a
insurance
agent
the
kind
who
does
not
insist
upon
insuring
your
life
whether
you
want
it
insured
or
not
the
agent
told
andy
to
call
him
jack
and
use
him
good
and
plenty
perhaps
because
something
wistful
and
lonely
in
the
gray
eyes
of
andy
appealed
to
him
and
andy
took
him
at
his
word
and
was
grateful
he
discovered
what
day
of
the
week
it
was
saturday
and
that
on
the
next
day
santa
cruz
would
be
because
of
an
excursion
from
sacramento
jack
offered
to
help
him
lose
himself
in
the
crowd
and
again
andy
was
grateful
for
the
first
time
since
leaving
the
flying
u
he
went
to
bed
feeling
not
utterly
alone
and
friendless
and
awoke
pleasantly
expectant
friend
jack
was
to
pilot
him
down
to
the
casino
at
eleven
and
he
had
incidentally
made
one
prediction
which
stuck
closely
to
andy
even
in
his
sleep
jack
had
assured
him
that
the
whole
town
would
be
at
the
beach
and
if
the
whole
town
were
at
the
beach
why
then
mary
would
surely
be
somewhere
in
the
crowd
and
if
she
were
in
the
crowd
if
she
there
i
sure
get
a
line
on
her
before
night
andy
told
himself
with
much
assurance
a
fellow
that
been
in
the
habit
of
cutting
any
certain
brand
of
critter
out
of
a
big
herd
ought
to
be
able
to
spot
his
girl
in
a
crowd
and
he
hummed
softly
while
he
dressed
the
excursion
train
was
already
in
town
and
the
esplanade
was
looking
down
from
beach
hill
a
river
of
hats
with
splotches
of
bright
colors
and
with
an
outer
fringe
of
men
and
women
that
a
uh
humans
andy
remarked
and
the
insurance
agent
laughed
appreciatively
you
wait
till
you
see
them
milling
around
on
the
board
walk
he
advised
impressively
if
you
happen
to
be
looking
for
anybody
realize
that
there
some
people
scattered
around
in
your
vicinity
i
had
a
date
with
a
girl
down
here
one
sunday
during
the
season
and
we
hunted
each
other
from
ten
in
the
morning
till
ten
at
night
and
never
got
sight
of
each
other
andy
gave
him
a
sidelong
suspicious
glance
but
friend
jack
was
evidently
as
innocent
as
he
looked
and
so
andy
limped
silently
down
the
hill
to
the
casino
and
wondered
if
fate
were
going
to
cheat
him
at
the
last
moment
once
in
the
crowd
it
was
as
jack
had
told
him
it
would
be
he
could
not
regard
the
moving
mass
of
humanity
as
individuals
though
long
living
where
men
are
few
had
fixed
upon
him
the
habit
now
although
he
observed
far
more
than
did
jack
he
felt
somewhat
at
a
loss
the
realization
that
mary
johnson
might
pass
him
unrecognized
troubled
him
greatly
it
did
not
once
occur
to
him
that
he
with
his
gray
stetson
hat
and
his
brown
face
and
keen
eyes
and
tall
figure
looked
not
at
all
like
the
thousands
of
men
all
around
him
so
that
many
eyes
turned
to
give
him
another
glance
when
he
passed
mary
johnson
must
be
unobserving
in
the
extreme
if
she
failed
to
know
him
once
she
glimpsed
him
in
the
crowd
somewhere
near
one
he
lost
jack
completely
and
drifted
aimlessly
alone
jack
had
been
hailed
by
a
friend
had
stopped
for
a
minute
to
talk
and
several
hundred
men
women
and
children
had
come
between
him
and
andy
pushing
and
crowding
and
surging
because
a
band
had
started
playing
somewhere
andy
got
down
the
steps
and
out
upon
the
sand
and
jack
was
thereafter
but
a
memory
he
found
the
loose
sand
hard
walking
with
his
lame
leg
and
almost
as
crowded
as
the
promenade
and
as
he
stood
for
a
minute
looking
up
at
the
board
walk
above
him
it
occurred
to
him
that
if
he
could
get
somewhere
and
stay
there
long
enough
every
human
being
at
the
casino
would
eventually
pass
by
him
he
went
up
the
steps
again
and
worked
his
way
along
the
edge
of
the
walk
until
he
found
a
vacant
spot
on
the
railing
and
sat
grimly
down
upon
it
to
wait
many
cigarettes
he
smoked
while
he
roosted
there
watching
until
the
eyes
of
him
ached
with
the
eternal
panorama
of
faces
that
were
strange
many
times
he
started
eagerly
because
he
glimpsed
a
fluffy
blond
pompadour
with
blue
eyes
beneath
and
fancied
for
an
instant
that
it
was
mary
then
when
he
was
speculating
upon
the
advisability
of
following
the
stream
of
people
that
flowed
out
upon
the
pleasure
pier
mary
passed
by
so
close
that
her
skirt
brushed
his
toes
passed
him
by
and
he
sat
there
like
a
paralytic
and
let
her
go
and
in
the
heart
of
him
was
a
queer
heavy
throb
that
he
did
not
in
the
least
understand
she
was
dressed
in
blue
linen
with
heavy
white
lace
in
patches
here
and
there
and
she
had
a
big
white
hat
tilted
back
from
her
face
and
a
long
white
plume
drooping
to
one
shoulder
another
girl
was
with
her
and
a
man
a
man
with
dented
panama
hat
and
pink
cheeks
and
a
white
waistcoat
and
tan
shoes
a
man
whom
andy
suddenly
hated
most
unreasonably
when
they
were
all
but
lost
in
the
crowd
andy
got
down
gripped
his
cane
vindictively
and
followed
after
all
the
man
was
walking
beside
the
other
girl
and
not
beside
mary
and
the
reflection
brought
much
solace
with
the
nodding
white
feather
to
guide
him
he
followed
them
down
the
walk
lost
them
for
a
second
saw
them
turn
in
at
the
doors
of
the
natatorium
saw
them
pause
there
just
inside
then
a
huge
woman
pushed
before
him
stood
there
and
narrowed
his
range
of
vision
down
to
her
own
generous
hat
with
its
huge
roses
and
when
he
had
edged
past
her
the
three
were
gone
andy
waited
comforted
by
the
knowledge
that
they
had
not
come
out
until
the
minutes
passed
his
patience
and
he
went
in
searched
the
gallery
unavailingly
came
out
again
and
wandered
on
dispiritedly
to
the
pleasure
pier
there
leaning
over
the
rail
he
saw
her
again
almost
beneath
him
in
the
sand
scantily
clad
in
a
bathing
suit
the
man
still
more
scantily
clad
was
trying
to
coax
her
into
the
water
and
she
was
hanging
back
and
laughing
a
good
deal
with
an
occasional
squeal
andy
leaned
rather
heavily
upon
the
railing
and
watched
her
gloweringly
incredulously
custom
has
much
to
do
with
a
man
or
a
woman
idea
of
propriety
and
one
andrew
green
had
for
long
been
unaccustomed
to
the
sight
of
nice
young
women
disporting
themselves
thus
in
so
public
a
place
he
could
not
reconcile
it
with
the
girl
as
he
had
known
her
in
her
father
cabin
and
he
was
not
at
all
sure
that
he
wanted
to
do
so
he
was
just
turning
gloomily
away
when
she
glanced
up
saw
him
and
waved
her
hand
hello
andy
she
called
gaily
come
on
down
and
take
a
swim
why
do
you
andy
looking
reproachfully
into
her
upturned
face
shook
his
head
i
ca
he
told
her
i
lame
yet
it
was
not
at
all
what
he
had
meant
to
say
any
more
than
this
was
the
meeting
he
had
dreamed
about
he
resented
both
with
inner
rage
oh
when
did
you
come
she
asked
casually
and
was
whisked
away
by
the
man
before
andy
could
tell
her
the
other
girl
was
there
also
and
the
three
ran
gleefully
down
to
meet
a
roller
larger
than
the
others
had
been
met
it
were
washed
with
much
screaming
and
laughter
back
to
shore
and
stood
there
dripping
andy
glared
down
upon
them
and
longed
for
the
privilege
of
drowning
the
fellow
we
going
up
into
the
plunge
called
mary
come
on
i
see
you
when
i
come
out
they
scampered
away
and
he
calling
himself
many
kinds
of
fool
followed
in
the
plunge
andy
was
still
more
at
a
disadvantage
for
since
he
was
a
spectator
a
huge
sign
informed
him
that
he
must
go
up
stairs
he
went
up
with
much
difficulty
into
the
gallery
found
himself
a
seat
next
the
rail
and
searched
long
for
mary
among
the
bathers
below
he
would
never
have
believed
that
he
would
fail
to
know
her
at
sight
but
with
fifty
women
more
or
less
dressed
exactly
alike
and
with
ugly
rubber
caps
pulled
down
to
eyebrows
and
ears
recognition
must
necessarily
be
slow
while
he
leaned
and
stared
an
avalanche
of
squeals
came
precipitately
down
the
great
slide
struck
the
water
and
was
transformed
to
gurgling
screams
and
then
heads
came
bobbing
to
the
surface
three
heads
and
one
of
them
was
mary
she
swept
the
water
from
her
eyes
looked
up
and
saw
him
waved
her
hand
and
scrambled
rather
ungracefully
over
the
rail
in
her
wet
clinging
suit
the
others
followed
the
man
trotting
at
her
heels
and
calling
something
after
her
andy
his
brows
pulled
down
over
unhappy
eyes
glared
fixedly
up
at
the
top
of
the
slide
in
a
minute
they
appeared
held
gesticulating
counsel
wavered
and
came
down
together
upon
their
stomachs
the
strange
girl
was
in
the
lead
with
mary
next
holding
to
the
feet
behind
her
slid
the
man
gripping
tightly
the
ankles
of
mary
andy
teeth
set
savagely
together
though
he
saw
that
others
were
doing
exactly
the
same
old
women
young
women
girls
men
and
boys
came
hurtling
down
the
big
slide
singly
in
couples
in
three
and
fours
the
spectacle
began
to
fascinate
him
so
that
for
a
minute
or
two
he
could
forget
mary
and
the
man
there
was
a
roar
of
voices
the
barking
as
of
seals
screams
laughter
and
much
splashing
men
and
women
dove
from
the
sides
like
startled
frogs
into
a
pond
they
swam
floated
and
stood
panting
along
the
walls
swung
from
the
trapeze
andy
remembering
his
career
with
the
circus
when
he
was
andré
de
gréno
champion
bareback
rider
of
the
western
hemisphere
wished
that
his
leg
was
well
so
that
he
could
show
them
a
few
things
about
that
trapeze
business
and
troubled
the
waters
with
much
splashing
he
could
not
keep
mary
always
in
view
but
when
he
did
get
sight
of
her
she
seemed
to
be
having
a
very
good
time
and
not
to
be
worrying
in
the
least
about
him
and
his
sins
twice
andy
green
half
rose
from
his
seat
meaning
to
leave
the
plunge
the
casino
and
the
whole
crowd
but
each
time
he
settled
back
telling
himself
that
he
hated
a
quitter
and
that
he
guessed
he
buy
a
few
more
chips
and
stay
in
the
game
it
seemed
a
long
time
before
mary
finally
emerged
in
the
blue
linen
and
the
white
hat
but
andy
was
waiting
doggedly
at
the
entrance
and
took
his
place
beside
her
forcing
the
man
to
walk
beside
the
girl
whom
mary
introduced
as
lola
parsons
the
man
name
was
roberts
but
the
girls
called
him
freddie
and
he
seemed
composed
mostly
of
a
smile
and
the
latest
fad
in
male
attire
andy
set
himself
to
the
task
of
cutting
mary
out
of
the
main
herd
so
that
he
might
talk
with
her
thus
it
happened
that
failing
a
secluded
spot
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
the
casino
which
buzzed
like
a
disturbed
hive
of
gigantic
bees
mary
presently
found
herself
on
a
car
that
was
clanging
its
signal
of
departure
and
there
was
no
sign
of
freddie
and
lola
parsons
we
lost
back
there
andy
told
her
calmly
when
she
inquired
and
as
to
where
we
going
i
do
know
as
far
as
this
will
take
us
this
car
goes
clear
out
to
the
cliffs
mary
said
discouragingly
all
right
we
going
out
to
the
cliffs
then
andy
smiled
blandly
down
upon
the
nodding
white
feather
in
her
hat
but
i
promised
lola
and
freddie
oh
that
all
right
i
take
the
blame
were
yuh
surprised
to
see
me
here
why
should
i
be
everybody
comes
to
santa
cruz
sooner
or
later
i
came
sooner
said
andy
trying
to
meet
her
eye
he
wanted
to
bring
the
conversation
to
themselves
so
that
he
might
explain
and
justify
himself
and
win
forgiveness
for
his
sins
while
they
walked
along
the
cliffs
he
tried
and
going
home
he
had
not
given
up
the
attempt
but
afterward
when
he
could
sit
down
quietly
and
think
he
was
forced
to
admit
that
he
had
not
succeeded
very
well
it
seemed
to
him
that
while
mary
still
liked
him
and
was
quite
ready
to
be
friends
she
had
forgotten
just
why
she
had
so
suddenly
left
montana
she
was
sorry
he
had
broken
his
leg
but
in
the
same
breath
almost
she
told
him
of
such
a
narrow
escape
that
freddie
had
last
week
when
an
auto
nearly
ran
him
down
andy
regretted
keenly
that
it
had
not
he
had
mentioned
irish
and
jack
bates
meaning
to
refute
the
tales
they
had
told
of
him
and
she
had
asked
about
the
black
lamb
and
the
white
and
then
had
told
him
that
he
must
go
out
to
the
whistling
buoy
and
see
the
real
whale
they
had
anchored
out
there
and
related
with
much
detail
how
freddie
had
taken
her
and
lola
out
and
how
the
water
was
so
rough
she
got
seasick
and
a
wave
splashed
over
and
ruined
freddie
new
summer
suit
that
spotted
dreadfully
it
was
she
remarked
a
durable
color
she
hoped
andy
would
stay
a
month
or
two
though
the
season
was
about
over
she
knew
he
would
just
love
the
plunge
and
the
and
there
was
going
to
be
a
barbacue
up
at
the
big
trees
in
two
weeks
and
it
would
seem
like
home
to
him
seeing
a
cow
roasted
whole
she
did
love
montana
and
she
hoped
he
brought
his
chaps
and
spurs
along
for
she
had
told
lola
so
much
about
him
and
she
wanted
lola
to
see
him
in
his
wild
west
clothes
all
this
should
have
pleased
andy
very
much
she
had
not
grown
cold
and
her
eyes
were
quite
as
teasing
and
her
smiles
as
luring
as
before
she
did
not
even
lay
personal
claim
to
freddie
that
he
should
be
jealous
when
she
spoke
of
freddie
his
name
was
linked
with
lola
parsons
and
andy
could
not
glean
that
she
had
ever
gone
anywhere
alone
with
him
she
had
seemed
anxious
that
he
should
enjoy
his
vacation
to
the
limit
and
had
mentioned
three
or
four
places
that
he
must
surely
see
and
informed
him
three
times
that
she
was
off
at
five
every
evening
and
could
show
him
around
they
had
dined
together
at
a
café
and
had
gone
back
to
the
casino
for
the
band
concert
and
they
had
not
been
interrupted
by
meeting
lola
parsons
and
freddie
and
she
had
given
him
a
very
cordial
when
they
parted
on
the
steps
of
her
boarding
house
at
eleven
so
there
was
absolutely
no
reason
for
the
mood
andy
was
in
when
he
accepted
his
key
from
the
hotel
clerk
and
went
up
to
his
room
for
a
man
who
has
traveled
more
than
a
thousand
miles
in
search
of
the
girl
he
had
dreamed
of
and
who
had
found
her
and
had
been
properly
welcomed
he
was
distinctly
gloomy
he
sat
down
by
the
open
window
and
smoked
four
cigarettes
said
damn
freddy
three
times
and
with
added
emphasis
each
time
though
he
knew
very
well
that
freddie
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
then
went
to
bed
in
the
morning
he
felt
better
and
went
out
by
himself
to
the
cliffs
where
they
had
been
before
and
sat
down
on
a
hummock
covered
with
short
grass
and
watched
the
great
unrest
of
the
ocean
and
wondered
where
the
flying
u
wagons
would
be
camping
that
night
somehow
the
wide
reach
of
water
reminded
him
of
the
prairie
the
rolling
billows
were
like
many
many
cattle
milling
restlessly
in
a
vast
herd
and
tossing
white
heads
and
horns
upward
below
him
the
pounding
surf
was
to
him
the
bellowing
of
a
thirsty
herd
corralled
this
is
sure
all
right
he
approved
rousing
a
little
it
almost
as
good
as
sitting
up
on
a
pinnacle
and
looking
out
over
the
range
if
i
had
a
good
hoss
and
my
riding
outfit
and
could
get
out
there
and
go
to
work
them
and
hazing
up
here
on
a
run
it
would
be
so
poor
by
gracious
this
is
worth
the
trip
all
right
it
never
occurred
to
andy
that
there
was
anything
strange
in
the
remark
or
that
he
sat
there
because
it
dulled
the
heavy
ache
that
had
been
his
since
yesterday
the
ache
of
finding
what
he
had
sought
and
finding
with
it
disillusionment
till
hunger
drove
him
away
he
stayed
and
his
dreams
were
of
the
wide
land
he
had
left
when
he
again
walked
down
pacific
avenue
the
hall
clock
struck
four
and
after
he
had
eaten
he
looked
up
at
it
and
saw
that
it
lacked
but
fifteen
minutes
of
five
i
supposed
to
meet
her
when
she
quits
work
he
remembered
and
lola
and
freddie
will
go
to
the
plunge
with
us
he
stopped
and
stared
in
at
the
window
of
a
curio
store
say
that
a
dandy
navajo
blanket
he
murmured
it
would
be
for
a
saddle
blanket
he
started
on
hesitated
and
went
back
i
got
time
enough
to
get
it
he
explained
to
himself
he
went
in
bought
the
blanket
and
two
mexican
that
caught
his
fancy
tucked
the
bundle
under
his
arm
and
started
down
the
street
toward
the
office
where
mary
worked
it
was
just
two
minutes
he
got
almost
to
the
door
so
near
that
his
toe
struck
against
a
corner
of
the
belabelled
bulletin
board
when
a
sudden
revulsion
swept
his
desires
back
like
a
huge
wave
he
stood
a
second
irresolutely
and
then
turned
back
aw
hell
what
the
use
he
muttered
the
clock
was
just
on
the
last
stroke
of
five
when
he
went
up
to
the
clerk
in
his
hotel
say
when
does
the
next
train
pull
out
i
give
a
darn
in
what
direction
he
wanted
to
know
when
the
clerk
told
him
he
grinned
and
became
undignifiedly
loquacious
i
want
to
show
yuh
a
couple
of
dandy
i
just
glommed
down
street
he
said
and
rolled
the
bundle
open
upon
the
desk
they
a
couple
uh
beauts
i
got
for
two
uh
my
friends
they
done
me
a
big
favor
a
month
or
two
ago
and
i
wanted
to
kinda
square
the
deal
that
why
i
got
just
alike
yes
you
bet
they
peaches
yuh
ca
get
like
this
in
montana
the
boys
sure
appreciate
he
retied
the
bundle
took
his
from
the
hand
of
the
smiling
clerk
and
started
up
the
stairway
humming
a
tune
under
his
breath
as
he
went
at
the
first
turn
he
stopped
and
looked
back
send
the
up
to
wake
me
at
seven
he
called
down
to
the
clerk
i
going
to
take
a
nap
and
it
be
all
your
life
worth
to
let
me
miss
that
train
lords
of
the
pots
and
pans
the
camp
of
the
flying
u
snuggled
just
within
the
arms
of
an
unnamed
coulee
with
a
creek
running
across
its
front
looked
picturesque
and
peaceful
from
a
distance
disenchantment
lay
in
wait
for
him
who
strayed
close
enough
to
hear
the
wrangling
in
the
however
or
who
followed
slim
to
where
he
slumped
bulkily
down
into
the
shade
of
a
willow
fifty
yards
or
so
from
camp
a
willow
where
pink
weary
andy
green
and
irish
were
lying
sprawled
and
smoking
comfortably
slim
grunted
and
moved
away
from
a
rock
that
was
gouging
him
in
the
back
by
golly
things
is
getting
pretty
raw
around
this
camp
he
growled
by
way
of
lifting
the
of
his
anger
i
like
to
know
when
that
darned
bought
into
the
outfit
anyhow
he
been
trying
to
run
it
to
suit
himself
all
spring
and
if
he
keeps
on
by
golly
he
be
firing
the
and
giving
all
the
orders
himself
it
would
seem
that
sympathy
should
be
offered
him
as
if
the
pause
he
made
plainly
hinted
that
it
was
expected
andy
green
rolled
over
and
sent
him
a
friendly
glance
just
to
hearten
him
a
bit
we
were
listening
to
the
noise
of
battle
he
observed
and
we
were
going
over
in
a
minute
to
carry
off
the
dead
you
had
a
kinda
animated
discussion
over
something
did
yuh
andy
was
on
his
good
behavior
as
he
had
been
for
a
month
his
treatment
of
his
fellows
lately
was
little
short
of
angelic
his
tone
soothed
slim
to
the
point
where
he
could
voice
his
woe
well
by
golly
i
guess
he
knows
what
i
think
of
him
or
pretty
near
i
stood
a
lot
from
patsy
off
and
on
and
i
took
just
about
all
i
going
to
it
got
so
yuh
ca
get
nothing
to
eat
hardly
when
yuh
ride
in
late
unless
yuh
fight
for
it
why
by
golly
i
caught
him
just
as
he
was
going
to
empty
out
the
and
he
knew
blamed
well
i
had
eat
he
left
everything
go
cold
and
he
was
packing
away
the
grub
like
he
was
late
breaking
camp
and
had
a
forty
mile
drive
before
dinner
by
golly
i
just
did
save
myself
some
coffee
and
that
was
all
but
it
was
cold
as
that
creek
and
habit
impelled
him
to
stop
there
long
enough
to
run
his
tongue
along
the
edge
of
a
cigarette
and
accident
caused
his
eyes
to
catch
the
amused
quirk
on
the
lips
of
pink
and
irish
and
the
laughing
glance
they
exchanged
possibly
if
he
could
have
looked
in
all
directions
at
the
same
time
he
would
have
been
able
to
detect
signs
of
mirth
on
the
faces
of
the
others
as
well
for
slim
grievances
never
seemed
to
be
taken
seriously
by
his
companions
which
is
the
price
which
one
must
pay
for
having
a
body
shaped
like
santa
claus
and
a
face
copied
after
our
old
friend
in
the
moon
well
by
golly
maybe
it
funny
but
i
took
notice
yuh
done
some
yowling
both
uh
yuh
the
other
day
when
yuh
did
get
no
pie
he
snorted
lighting
his
cigarette
with
unsteady
fingers
we
was
laughing
at
that
lied
pink
pacifically
and
then
by
golly
the
old
devil
lied
to
me
and
said
there
was
no
pie
left
went
on
slim
complainingly
his
memory
stirred
by
the
taunt
he
had
himself
given
but
i
would
take
his
word
for
a
thing
if
i
knew
it
was
so
i
went
on
a
around
that
tent
on
my
own
hook
and
i
found
a
pie
a
by
golly
cached
away
under
an
empty
behind
the
stove
that
he
added
staring
at
the
group
that
there
was
right
where
me
and
patsy
mixed
the
lying
old
devil
said
he
never
knew
a
thing
about
it
being
there
at
all
pink
turned
his
head
cautiously
so
that
his
eyes
met
the
eyes
of
andy
green
the
two
had
been
at
some
pains
to
place
that
pie
in
a
safe
place
so
that
they
might
be
sure
of
something
appetizing
when
they
came
in
from
standing
guard
that
night
but
neither
seemed
to
think
it
necessary
to
proclaim
the
fact
and
clear
patsy
i
bet
yuh
did
do
a
thing
to
the
pie
when
yuh
did
find
it
pink
half
questioned
more
anxious
than
he
would
have
owned
by
golly
i
eat
the
whole
thing
and
i
cussed
patsy
between
every
mouthful
boasted
slim
almost
in
a
again
i
sure
got
the
old
boy
stirred
up
i
left
him
swearin
dutch
that
sounded
like
he
was
peevish
but
i
betche
he
wo
throw
out
the
coffee
till
i
had
what
i
want
after
this
by
golly
happy
jack
is
out
yet
weary
observed
after
a
sympathetic
silence
you
ought
to
have
put
patsy
on
the
fight
till
everybody
was
filled
up
slim
happy
liable
to
go
to
bed
with
an
empty
tummy
if
yuh
do
ride
out
and
warn
him
to
approach
easy
listen
over
there
from
where
they
lay
so
still
was
the
air
and
so
incensed
was
patsy
they
could
hear
plainly
the
rumbling
of
his
wrath
while
he
talked
to
himself
over
the
dishwashing
when
he
appeared
at
the
corner
of
the
tent
or
plodded
out
toward
the
front
of
the
wagon
his
heavy
tread
and
stiff
neck
proclaimed
eloquently
the
mood
he
was
in
they
watched
and
listened
and
were
secretly
rather
glad
they
were
fed
and
so
need
not
face
the
storm
which
slim
had
raised
for
patsy
thoroughly
roused
was
very
much
like
an
angry
bull
till
his
rage
cooled
he
would
charge
whoever
approached
him
absolutely
blind
to
consequences
well
i
ai
going
to
put
nobody
next
slim
asserted
happy
got
to
take
chances
same
as
i
did
and
while
we
on
the
subject
patsy
was
on
the
prod
before
i
struck
camp
or
he
would
uh
acted
the
way
he
done
somebody
else
riled
him
up
by
golly
i
never
well
you
sure
did
put
the
finishing
touches
to
him
contended
irish
guiltily
aware
that
he
himself
was
originally
responsible
for
patsy
never
had
liked
irish
very
well
because
of
certain
incidents
connected
with
his
introduction
to
weary
double
patsy
never
could
quite
forget
though
he
might
forgive
and
resentment
lay
always
close
to
the
surface
of
his
mood
when
irish
was
near
happy
jack
hungry
and
quite
unconscious
that
he
was
riding
straight
into
the
trail
of
trouble
galloped
around
a
ragged
point
of
bushes
stopped
with
a
lurch
at
the
prostrate
corral
and
unsaddled
hastily
those
in
the
shade
of
the
willow
watched
him
their
very
silence
proclaiming
loudly
their
interest
they
might
have
warned
him
by
a
word
but
they
did
not
for
happy
jack
was
never
eager
to
heed
warnings
or
to
take
advice
preferring
always
to
abide
by
the
rule
of
opposites
from
long
riding
the
knees
of
his
old
leather
chaps
bulging
out
in
transient
simulation
of
bowed
limbs
he
came
clanking
down
upon
the
with
no
thought
but
to
ease
his
hunger
those
who
watched
saw
him
stoop
and
thrust
his
head
into
the
tent
heard
a
bellow
and
saw
him
back
out
hastily
they
chuckled
unfeelingly
and
strained
ears
to
miss
no
word
of
what
would
follow
aw
gwan
happy
jack
expostulated
not
yet
angry
i
got
here
quick
as
i
could
and
ai
heard
nothing
about
no
new
laws
uh
getting
here
when
the
whistle
blows
gim
me
what
there
is
anyhow
some
sentences
followed
which
because
of
guttural
tones
and
german
accent
emphasized
by
excitement
were
not
quite
coherent
to
the
listeners
however
they
did
not
feel
at
all
mystified
as
to
his
meaning
knowing
patsy
as
they
did
aw
come
off
somebody
must
uh
slipped
yuh
a
jug
uh
something
i
rode
the
range
about
as
long
as
you
cooked
on
it
and
i
never
knowed
a
man
to
go
without
his
supper
yet
just
because
he
come
in
late
i
betche
yuh
dassent
stand
and
say
that
before
chip
yuh
blamed
old
dutch
just
there
happy
jack
dodged
and
escaped
getting
more
than
a
third
of
the
basin
of
water
which
came
splashing
out
of
the
tent
the
group
under
the
willows
could
no
longer
lie
at
ease
while
they
listened
they
jumped
up
and
moved
closer
just
as
a
crowd
always
does
surge
nearer
and
nearer
to
an
exciting
centre
they
did
not
however
interfere
by
word
or
deed
if
yuh
was
just
about
ready
t
die
of
old
age
and
general
cussedness
stormed
happy
jack
i
just
about
kill
yuh
for
that
this
however
is
a
revised
version
and
not
intended
to
be
exact
i
want
my
supper
and
i
want
it
blame
quick
too
or
there
be
a
dead
dutchman
in
camp
no
yuh
do
you
git
out
uh
that
tent
and
lem
me
git
in
or
happy
jack
had
the
axe
in
his
hand
by
then
and
he
swung
it
fearsomely
and
permitted
the
gesture
to
round
out
his
sentence
perhaps
there
would
have
been
something
more
than
words
between
them
for
even
a
happy
jack
may
be
goaded
too
far
when
he
is
hungry
but
chip
who
had
been
washing
out
some
handkerchiefs
down
by
the
creek
heard
the
row
and
came
up
squeezing
a
ball
of
wet
muslin
on
the
way
he
did
not
say
much
when
he
arrived
and
he
did
not
do
anything
more
threatening
than
hang
the
handkerchiefs
over
the
to
dry
tying
the
corners
to
keep
the
wind
from
whipping
them
away
up
the
coulee
but
the
result
was
satisfying
to
happy
jack
at
least
he
ate
and
was
filled
and
patsy
retired
from
the
fray
sullenly
owning
defeat
for
that
time
at
least
he
went
up
the
creek
out
of
sight
from
camp
and
he
stayed
there
until
the
dusk
was
so
thick
that
his
big
form
was
barely
distinguishable
in
the
gloom
when
he
returned
at
daylight
he
was
his
old
self
except
that
he
was
perhaps
a
trifle
gruff
when
he
spoke
and
a
good
deal
inclined
to
silence
and
harmony
came
and
abode
for
a
season
with
the
flying
u
patsy
had
for
years
cooked
for
jim
whitmore
and
his
outfit
so
many
years
it
was
that
memory
of
the
number
was
never
exact
and
even
the
old
man
would
have
been
compelled
to
preface
the
number
with
a
few
minutes
of
meditation
and
a
lem
me
see
now
patsy
been
cooking
for
me
was
that
hard
winter
and
he
come
the
spring
no
the
fall
before
that
i
know
because
he
like
to
froze
before
we
got
the
chinked
up
good
i
be
doggoned
if
patsy
ai
gitting
that
was
it
perhaps
patsy
was
getting
old
and
old
age
does
not
often
sweeten
one
temper
if
you
notice
those
angelic
old
men
and
old
ladies
have
nearly
all
been
immortalized
in
stories
and
songs
and
the
unsung
remainder
have
nerves
and
notions
and
rheumatism
and
tongues
sharpened
by
all
the
disappointments
and
sorrows
of
their
long
lives
patsy
never
had
been
angelic
he
had
always
been
the
victim
of
more
or
less
humor
on
the
part
of
the
happy
family
and
the
victim
of
tempers
as
well
he
had
always
grumbled
and
rumbled
dutch
profanity
when
they
goaded
him
too
hard
and
his
amiability
had
ever
expressed
itself
in
juicy
pies
and
puddings
rather
than
in
words
on
this
roundup
however
he
was
not
often
amiable
and
he
was
nearly
always
rumbling
to
himself
more
than
that
he
was
becoming
resentful
of
extra
work
and
bother
and
he
sometimes
permitted
his
resentment
to
carry
him
farther
than
was
wise
to
quarrel
with
patsy
was
rapidly
becoming
the
fashion
and
to
gossip
about
him
and
his
faults
was
already
a
habit
a
habit
indulged
in
too
freely
perhaps
for
the
good
of
the
camp
isolation
from
the
world
brings
small
things
into
greater
prominence
than
is
normally
their
due
and
large
troubles
are
born
of
very
small
irritations
for
two
days
there
was
peace
of
a
sort
and
then
big
medicine
having
eaten
no
dinner
because
of
a
headache
rode
into
camp
about
three
and
headed
straight
for
the
quite
as
if
he
had
a
right
that
must
not
be
questioned
custom
did
indeed
warrant
him
in
lunching
without
the
ceremony
of
asking
leave
of
the
cook
for
patsy
even
in
his
most
unpleasant
moods
had
never
until
lately
tried
to
stop
anyone
from
eating
when
he
was
hungry
on
this
day
however
big
medicine
unthinkingly
cut
into
a
pie
set
out
to
cool
there
were
other
pies
and
in
cutting
one
big
medicine
was
supported
by
precedent
but
patsy
chose
to
consider
it
an
affront
and
snatched
the
pie
from
under
big
medicine
very
nose
you

vot

big

his
eyes
standing
out
from
his
face
stared
agape
well
by
cripes
he
hesitated
looking
about
him
but
whether
his
search
was
for
more
pie
or
for
moral
support
he
did
not
say
truth
to
tell
there
was
plenty
of
both
he
reached
for
another
pie
and
another
knife
and
he
grinned
his
wide
grin
at
irish
who
had
just
come
up
dutchy
trying
to
run
a
whizzer
he
remarked
cutting
a
defiant
gash
clean
across
the
second
pie
what
do
yuh
know
about
that
he
often
took
that
way
said
irish
soothingly
you
do
want
all
that
pie
give
me
about
half
of
it
big
medicine
his
mouth
too
full
for
coherent
utterance
waved
his
hand
and
his
knife
toward
the
shelf
at
the
back
of
the
where
three
more
pies
sat
steaming
in
the
shade
help
yourself
he
invited
juicily
when
he
could
speak
those
familiar
with
camp
life
in
the
summer
have
perhaps
observed
the
miraculous
manner
in
which
a
million
or
so
will
come
swarming
around
when
one
opens
a
can
of
fruit
or
uncovers
the
sugar
jar
it
was
like
that
irish
helped
himself
without
any
hesitation
whatever
and
he
had
not
taken
a
mouthful
before
happy
jack
weary
and
pink
were
buzzing
around
for
all
the
world
like
the
mentioned
before
patsy
buzzed
also
but
no
one
paid
the
slightest
attention
until
the
last
mouthful
of
the
last
pie
was
placed
in
retirement
where
it
would
be
most
appreciated
then
weary
became
aware
of
patsy
and
his
wrath
and
turned
to
him
pacifically
oh
yuh
do
want
to
worry
none
about
the
pie
he
smiled
winningly
at
him
mamma
how
do
you
expect
to
keep
pies
around
this
camp
when
yuh
go
right
on
making
such
good
ones
yuh
had
ought
to
be
such
a
crackajack
of
a
cook
patsy
if
you
do
want
folks
to
eat
themselves
sick
if
any
man
among
them
could
have
soothed
patsy
weary
would
certainly
have
been
the
man
for
next
to
chip
he
was
patsy
favorite
to
say
that
he
failed
is
only
one
way
of
making
plain
how
great
was
indignation
aw
yuh
made
to
be
eat
did
yuh
argued
happy
jack
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
we
eat
now
or
two
hours
from
now
patsy
tried
to
tell
them
the
difference
he
called
his
hands
and
his
head
to
help
his
tongue
and
he
managed
to
make
himself
very
well
understood
they
did
not
argue
the
fine
point
of
gastronomic
ethics
which
he
raised
though
they
felt
that
his
position
was
not
unassailable
and
his
ultimate
victory
not
assured
instead
they
peered
into
boxes
and
cans
which
were
covered
gleaned
a
whole
box
of
seeded
raisins
and
some
shredded
cocoanut
just
to
tease
him
and
retired
to
wrangle
ostentatiously
over
their
treasure
trove
in
the
shade
of
the
leaving
patsy
to
his
anger
and
his
empty
tins
other
men
straggled
in
drifted
with
the
tide
of
their
appetites
to
the
hovered
there
briefly
and
retired
vanquished
and
still
hungry
they
invariably
came
over
to
the
little
group
which
was
munching
raisins
and
cocoanut
and
asked
accusing
questions
what
was
the
matter
with
patsy
who
had
put
him
on
the
fight
like
that
and
other
inquiries
upon
the
same
subject
just
because
they
were
all
lying
around
camp
with
nothing
to
do
but
eat
patsy
was
late
with
his
supper
that
night
it
would
seem
that
he
dallied
purposely
and
revengefully
and
though
the
happy
family
flung
at
him
taunts
and
orders
it
is
significant
that
they
shouted
from
a
distance
and
avoided
coming
to
close
quarters
just
how
and
when
they
began
their
foolish
little
game
of
imitation
does
not
matter
when
work
did
not
press
and
red
blood
bubbled
they
frequently
indulged
in
one
another
to
the
tune
of
much
taunting
and
many
a
bet
yuh
ca
pitch
off
before
supper
was
called
they
were
hard
at
it
and
they
quite
forgot
patsy
i
give
any
man
a
dollar
that
can
ride
me
straight
up
by
cripes
bellowed
big
medicine
going
down
upon
all
fours
by
way
of
invitation
easy
money
and
mine
from
the
start
retorted
irish
and
immediately
straddled
big
medicine
back
horses
and
riders
pantingly
gave
over
their
own
exertions
and
got
out
of
the
way
for
big
medicine
played
bronk
as
he
did
everything
else
with
all
his
heart
and
soul
and
muscles
and
since
he
was
strong
as
a
bull
riding
him
promised
much
in
the
way
of
excitement
yuh
can
hold
on
by
my
collar
but
if
yuh
choke
me
down
i
murder
yuh
in
cold
blood
he
warned
irish
before
he
started
and
do

so
irish
offered
generously
move
you
snail
he
struck
big
medicine
spectacularly
with
his
hat
yelled
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
the
riding
began
immediately
and
tumultuously
it
is
very
difficult
to
describe
accurately
and
effectively
the
evolutions
of
a
horse
when
he
pitches
his
worst
and
hardest
it
is
still
more
difficult
to
set
down
in
words
the
gyrations
of
a
man
when
he
is
playing
that
he
is
a
broncho
and
is
trying
to
dislodge
the
fellow
upon
his
back
big
medicine
reared
and
kicked
and
bellowed
and
snorted
he
came
down
upon
a
small
cactus
and
was
obliged
to
call
a
recess
while
he
extracted
three
cactus
spines
from
his
knee
with
his
smallest
and
some
profanity
he
rolled
down
his
trousers
leg
closed
his
knife
and
tossed
it
to
pink
for
fear
he
might
lose
it
examined
critically
a
patch
of
grass
to
make
sure
there
were
no
more
cacti
hidden
there
and
bawled
come
on
now
i
sure
give
yuh
a
run
for
your
money
time
by
cripes
and
began
all
over
again
how
human
muscles
can
bear
the
strain
he
put
upon
his
own
must
be
always
something
of
a
mystery
he
described
curves
in
the
air
which
would
sound
incredible
he
swapped
ends
with
all
the
ease
of
a
real
fighting
broncho
and
came
near
sending
irish
off
more
than
once
insensibly
he
neared
the
where
patsy
so
far
forgot
himself
as
to
stand
just
without
the
lifted
flap
and
watch
the
fun
with
sour
interest
yuh
yelled
big
medicine
quite
purple
but
far
from
surrender
and
gave
a
leap
go
me
shouted
irish
whipping
down
the
sides
of
his
mount
with
his
hat
big
medicine
answered
the
taunt
by
a
queer
twisted
plunge
which
he
had
saved
for
the
last
it
brought
irish
over
his
head
and
it
landed
him
fairly
in
the
middle
of
patsy
great
pan
of
soft
bread
sponge
and
landed
him
upon
his
head
into
the
bargain
irish
wriggled
there
a
moment
and
came
up
absolutely
unrecognizable
and
a
good
deal
dazed
big
medicine
rolled
helplessly
in
the
grass
laughing
his
big
bellowing
laugh
it
was
straight
into
that
laugh
and
the
great
mouth
from
where
it
issued
that
patsy
beside
himself
with
rage
at
the
accident
deposited
all
the
soft
dough
which
was
not
clinging
to
the
head
and
face
of
irish
he
was
not
content
with
that
while
the
happy
family
roared
appreciation
of
the
spectacle
patsy
returned
with
a
kettle
of
meat
and
tried
to
land
that
neatly
upon
the
dough

he
brought
the
and
threw
that
also
at
the
two
and
followed
it
with
a
big
basin
of
stewed
corn
irish
all
dough
as
he
was
went
for
him
blindly
and
grappled
with
him
and
it
was
upon
this
turbulent
scene
which
chip
looked
first
when
he
rode
up
the
happy
family
crowded
around
him
gasping
and
tried
to
explain
they
were
doing
some
by
golly
patsy
no
business
to
set
his

ground

the

came
disjointedly
mere
punctuation
points
to
his
wild
sparring
it
was
plain
that
irish
furious
though
he
was
was
trying
not
to
hurt
patsy
very
much
but
it
took
four
men
to
separate
them
for
all
that
when
they
had
dragged
irish
perforce
down
to
the
creek
by
which
they
had
camped
and
had
yelled
to
big
medicine
to
come
on
and
feed
the
fish
quiet
should
have
been
restored
but
it
was
not
patsy
was
in
american
parlance
running
amuck
he
was
jumbling
three
languages
together
into
an
indistinguishable
tumult
of
sound
and
he
was
emptying
the
of
everything
which
his
stout
german
muscles
could
fling
from
it
not
a
thing
did
he
leave
that
was
eatable
and
the
dishes
within
his
reach
he
scattered
recklessly
to
all
the
winds
of
heaven
when
one
venturesome
soul
after
another
approached
to
calm
him
he
found
it
expedient
to
duck
and
run
to
cover
patsy
aim
was
terribly
exact
the
happy
family
under
cover
or
at
a
safe
distance
from
the
hurtling
pans
cans
and
stove
wood
caressed
sundry
bumps
and
waited
meekly
irish
and

more

the
features
god
had
given
them

by
a
circuitous
route
and
joined
their
fellows

at

there

emptying
every
grain
uh
rolled
oats
on
the
ground
happy
jack
was
a
somebody
better
go
over
and
stop
you
ai
tied
down
suggested
cal
emmett
rather
pointedly
and
happy
jack
said
no
more
chip
usually
so
incisively
clear
as
to
his
intentions
and
his
duties
waited
irresolutely
and
dodged
missiles
along
with
the
rest
of
them
when
patsy
subsided
for
the
very
good
reason
that
there
was
nothing
else
which
he
could
throw
out
chip
took
the
matter
up
with
him
and
told
him
quite
plainly
some
of
the
duties
of
a
cook
a
few
of
his
privileges
and
all
of
his
limitations
the
result
however
was
not
quite
what
he
expected
patsy
would
not
even
listen
py
cosh
i
not
stand
for
dose
poys
no
more
he
declared
wagging
his
head
with
its
shiny
crown
and
the
fringe
of
grizzled
hair
around
the
back
i

he
untied
his
apron
threw
it
spitefully
upon
the
ground
and
stamped
upon
it
clumsily
like
a
maddened
elephant
well
quit
then
chip
was
fast
losing
his
own
temper
what
with
the
heat
and
his
hunger
and
a
general
distaste
for
camp
troubles
this
jangling
has
got
to
stop
right
here
we
had
about
enough
of
it
in
the
last
month
if
you
ca
cook
for
the
outfit
peaceably
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
or
if
he
did
the
distance
muffled
the
words
for
he
was
leading
his
horse
back
to
the
vicinity
of
the
rope
corral
that
he
might
unsaddle
and
turn
him
loose
he
heard
several
voices
muttering
angrily
but
his
wrath
was
ever
of
the
variety
so
that
he
would
not
look
around
to
see
what
was
the
matter
the
tumult
grew
however
until
when
he
did
turn
he
saw
patsy
stalking
off
across
the
prairie
with
his
hat
on
and
his
coat
folded
neatly
over
his
arm
and
irish
and
big
medicine
fighting
wickedly
in
the
open
space
between
the
two
tents
he
finished
unsaddling
and
then
went
stalking
over
to
quell
this
latest
development
they
trying
to
find
out
who
was
to
blame
weary
informed
him
when
he
was
quite
close
bud
has
got
much
tact
he
called
irish
a
irish
did
think
it
was
true
humor
and
he
hit
bud
on
the
nose
he
claims
that
bud
pitched
him
into
that
dishpan
uh
dough
with
malice
aforethought
better
let
argue
the
point
to
a
finish
now
they
started
it
black
eyes
for
the
peacemaker
you
believe
while
the
dusk
folded
them
close
and
the
nighthawks
swooped
from
afar
the
happy
family
gathered
round
and
watched
them
fight
chip
and
weary
thoughtfully
went
into
the
and
got
the
guns
which
were
stowed
away
in
the
beds
of
the
combatants
so
that
when
their
anger
reached
the
killing
point
they
must
let
it
bubble
harmlessly
until
the
fires
which
fed
it
went
cold
which
was
exceeding
wise
of
the
two
for
big
medicine
and
irish
did
get
to
that
very
point
and
raged
all
over
the
camp
because
they
could
not
shoot
each
other
the
hottest
battle
must
perforce
end
sometime
and
so
the
camp
of
the
flying
u
did
at
last
settle
into
some
semblance
of
calm
irish
rolled
his
bed
saddled
a
horse
and
rode
off
toward
town
quite
as
if
he
were
going
for
good
and
all
big
medicine
went
down
to
the
creek
for
the
second
time
that
evening
to
wash
away
the
marks
of
strife
and
when
he
returned
he
went
straight
to
bed
without
a
word
to
anyone
patsy
was
gone
no
man
knew
whither
and
the
was
as
nearly
wrecked
as
might
be
makes
me
think
uh
that
time
we
had
the
ringtailed
tiger
in
camp
sighed
andy
green
shaking
sand
out
of
the
teakettle
so
that
it
could
be
refilled
by
golly
i
ruther
have
a
whole
band
uh
tagers
than
this
fighting
bunch
slim
affirmed
earnestly
slim
was
laboring
sootily
with
the
which
patsy
had
struck
askew
with
a
stick
of
wood
outside
happy
jack
was
protesting
in
what
he
believed
to
be
an
undertone
against
being
installed
in
patsy
place
aw
that
always
the
way
anything
comes
up
it
you
git
in
and
rustle
some
chuck
ai
no
cook
or
if
i
be
they
might
pay
me
cook
wages
i
betche
there
ai
another
man
in
camp
would
stand
for
it
somebody
got
to
take
that
bacon
down
to
the
creek
and
wash
it
off
if
yuh
want
any
meat
for
supper
there
ai
no
time
to
boil
beef
if
i
a
been
boss
uh
this
outfit
i
betche
no
blame
cook
on
earth
would
uh
made
like
patsy
done
but
no
one
paid
the
slightest
attention
to
happy
jack
having
plenty
to
think
of
and
to
do
before
they
slept
not
even
the
sun
when
it
shone
again
could
warm
their
hearts
to
a
joy
in
living
happy
jack
cooked
the
breakfast
but
his
coffee
was
weak
and
his
biscuits
soggy
and
patsy
had
managed
to
make
the
butter
absolutely
uneatable
with
sand
also
they
were
late
and
chip
was
surly
over
the
double
loss
of
cook
and
cowboy
happy
jack
packed
food
and
dishes
in
much
the
same
spirit
which
patsy
had
shown
the
night
before
climbed
sullenly
to
the
high
seat
gathered
up
the
reins
of
the
four
restive
horses
released
the
brake
and
let
out
a
yell
surcharged
with
all
the
bitterness
bottled
within
his
soul
had
not
done
anything
to
precipitate
the
trouble
beyond
eating
half
a
pie
he
had
been
an
innocent
spectator
not
even
taking
part
in
the
yet
here
he
was
condemned
to
the
quite
as
if
he
were
to
blame
for
patsy
leaving
the
eyes
of
happy
jack
gazed
gloomily
upon
the
world
and
his
driving
seemed
a
reckless
invitation
to
disaster
i
betche
i
make
good
and
sick
uh
cooking
he
plotted
while
he
went
rattling
and
bumping
over
the
untrailed
prairie
he
succeeded
so
well
that
two
days
later
chip
gave
a
curt
order
or
two
and
headed
his
wagons
horses
and
his
bunch
of
riders
for
dry
lake
passing
by
even
the
flying
u
coulee
in
his
haste
just
outside
the
town
upon
the
creek
which
saves
the
inhabitants
from
dying
of
thirst
or
he
left
the
wagons
with
happy
jack
slim
and
one
alien
to
set
up
camp
and
rode
to
the
little
red
depot
the
telegram
which
went
speeding
to
great
falls
and
to
a
friend
there
was
brief
but
it
was
eloquent
and
not
quite
flattering
to
happy
jack
it
read
like
this
john
scott
the
palace
great
falls
for
god
sake
send
me
a
cook
by
return
train
must
deliver
goods
or
die
hard
bennett
flying
u
whether
the
cook
must
die
hard
or
whether
he
meant
the
friend
chip
did
not
trouble
to
make
plain
telegrams
are
bound
by
such
rigid
limitations
and
he
had
gone
over
the
rate
as
it
was
but
he
told
weary
to
receive
the
cook
be
he
white
or
black
have
him
restock
the
to
his
liking
and
then
bring
the
outfit
to
the
ranch
when
chip
would
again
take
it
in
hand
he
said
that
he
was
going
home
to
get
a
square
meal
and
he
mentioned
happy
jack
along
with
several
profane
words
johnny
scott
will
send
a
cook
and
a
good
one
he
added
hopefully
johnny
never
threw
down
a
friend
in
his
life
and
he
never
will
and
say
weary
if
he
wires
you
collect
the
message
and
act
accordingly
i
going
to
have
a
decent
supper
he
was
riding
a
good
horse
and
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
be
late
in
arriving
especially
if
he
kept
the
gait
at
which
he
left
town
in
two
hours
weary
pink
and
andy
green
were
touching
over
a
telegram
from
johnny
scott
a
telegram
which
was
brief
as
chip
and
more
illuminating

scott

mused
andy
reading
it
for
the
fourth
time
but
there
thirteen
words
in
that
telegram
if
yuh
notice
i
wish
yuh
would
try
to
butt
in
on
happy
jack
specialty
weary
remonstrated
folding
the
message
and
slipping
it
inside
the
yellow
envelope
if
this
is
the
same
jasper
that
cooked
there
a
month
ago
we
going
to
eat
ourselves
plumb
to
death
a
better
meal
i
never
laid
away
inside
me
than
the
one
i
got
at
the
park
hotel
when
i
was
up
there
last
time
come
on
over
to
the
hotel
and
eat
their
chuck
the
best
in
the
world
but
it
could
be
a
lot
worse
and
still
beat
happy
jack
to
a
jelly
part
two
the
whole
happy
family
barring
happy
jack
who
was
sulking
in
camp
because
of
certain
things
which
had
been
said
of
his
cooking
and
which
he
had
overheard
clanked
spurs
impatiently
upon
the
platform
and
waited
for
the
arrival
of
the
train
from
the
west
when
at
last
it
snorted
into
town
and
nosed
its
way
up
to
the
platform
they
bunched
instinctively
and
gazed
eagerly
at
the
steps
which
led
down
from
the
smoker
a
slim
little
man
in
blue
serge
a
man
with
the
complexion
of
a
strip
of
rawhide
and
the
mustache
of
a
orchestra
leader
felt
his
way
gingerly
down
by
the
light
of
the
brakeman
lantern
hesitated
and
then
came
questioningly
toward
them
carrying
with
some
difficulty
a
bulky
suitcase
it
him
all
right
muttered
pink
while
they
waited
the
little
man
stopped
apologetically
before
the
group
indistinct
in
the
faint
light
from
the
office
window
already
the
train
was
sliding
away
into
the
dark
pardon
he
apologized
i
am
looking
for
the
u
fich
flies
this
is
it
weary
assured
him
gravely
we
take
yuh
right
on
out
to
camp
pretty
dark
is
it
let
me
take
your
grip
i
know
the
way
better
than
you
do
weary
was
not
in
the
habit
of
making
himself
a
porter
for
any
man
accommodation
but
the
way
back
to
where
they
had
left
the
horses
was
dark
and
the
new
cook
was
very
small
and
slight
they
filed
silently
back
to
rusty
brown
place
invited
the
cook
in
for
a
drink
and
were
refused
with
regret
and
the
gracious
assurance
that
he
would
wait
outside
for
them
weary
it
was
and
pink
to
bear
him
company
who
piloted
the
stranger
out
to
camp
and
showed
him
where
he
might
sleep
in
patsy
bed
patsy
had
left
town
the
happy
family
had
been
informed
with
the
declaration
often
repeated
that
he
was
neffer
cooming
back
alreatty
he
had
even
left
behind
him
his
bed
and
his
clothes
rather
than
meet
again
any
member
of
the
flying
u
outfit
we
like
breakfast
somewhere
near
sunrise
weary
told
the
cook
at
parting
soon
as
the
store
opens
in
the
morning
we
drive
in
and
you
can
stock
up
the
wagon
we
pretty
near
down
to
cases
judging
from
the
meals
we
have
been
getting
lately
hope
yuh
make
out
all
right
i
will
do
very
nicely
i
thank
you
smiled
the
new
cook
in
the
light
of
the
lantern
which
stood
upon
the
fireless
i
wish
you
gentlemen
and
sweet
dreams
of
loved
ones

he
a
polite

commented
when
they
were

fich

that
a
good

what
is
he

you

he
liable
to
be

and
i
gamble
he
can
build
a
good
dinner
for
a
hungry
man
that
the
main
point
said
weary
at
daybreak
weary
woke
and
heard
him
humming
a
little
tune
while
he
moved
softly
about
the
and
the
evidently
searching
mostly
for
the
things
which
were
not
there
to
judge
from
stray
remarks
which
interrupted
the
love
song
rolled
oat
i
do

he
heard
once
and
again
where
the
clean
towels
they
are
that
i
do
not
discover
weary
smiled
sleepily
and
took
another
nap
the
cook
manner
of
announcing
breakfast
was
such
that
it
awoke
even
jack
bates
notoriously
a
and
cal
emmett
who
was
almost
as
bad
instead
of
pounding
upon
a
pan
and
lustily
roaring
in
the
manner
of
roundup
cooks
he
came
softly
up
to
the
lifted
a
flap
deprecatingly
and
announced
in
a
velvet
voice
breakfast
is
served
gentlemen
andy
green
whose
experiences
had
been
varied
sat
up
and
blinked
at
the
gently
swaying
flap
where
the
cook
had
been
standing
say
what
we
got
in
camp
he
asked
curiously
a
butler
by
golly
that
the
way
a
cook
be
vowed
slim
and
reached
for
his
hat
they
dressed
hastily
and
trooped
down
to
the
creek
for
their
morning
ablutions
and
hurried
back
to
the
breakfast
which
waited
the
new
cook
was
smiling
and
apologetic
and
anxious
to
please
the
happy
family
felt
almost
as
if
there
were
a
woman
in
camp
and
became
very
polite
without
in
the
least
realizing
that
they
were
not
behaving
in
the
usual
manner
or
dreaming
that
they
were
unconsciously
trying
to
live
up
to
their
chef
the
breakfast
it
is
of
a
lacking
in
many
things
fich
i
shall
endeavor
to
remedy
he
assured
them
pouring
coffee
as
if
he
were
serving
royalty
he
was
dressed
immaculately
in
white
cap
and
apron
and
his
mustache
was
waxed
to
a
degree
which
made
it
resemble
a
whiskers
the
happy
family
tasted
the
coffee
and
glanced
eloquently
at
one
another
it
was
better
than
patsy
coffee
even
and
as
for
happy
jack
there
were
biscuits
the
like
of
which
they
never
had
tasted
before
the
bacon
was
crisp
and
delicately
brown
and
delicious
the
potatoes
cooked
in
a
new
and
enticing
way
the
happy
family
showed
its
appreciation
as
seemed
to
them
most
convincing
they
left
not
a
scrap
of
anything
and
they
drank
two
cups
of
coffee
apiece
when
that
was
not
their
habit
later
they
hitched
the
four
horses
to
the
learned
that
the
new
cook
though
he
deeply
regretted
his
inefficiency
did
not
drive
anything
the
small
burro
he
explained
i
ride
him
yes
and
also
the
automobile
drive
i
when
the
way
is
smooth
but
the
horses
i
make
not
acquainted
with
him
i
could
ride
upon
the
elevated
seat
yes
but
to
drive
the
quartet
i
would

about

to
do
his
own
driving
i
betche
weary
went
close
and
pointed
a
finger
impressively
happy
you
he
said
and
happy
jack
turned
without
a
word
and
climbed
glumly
up
to
the
seat
of
the
well
are
yuh
coming
or
ai
yuh
he
inquired
of
the
cook
in
a
tone
surcharged
with
disgust
if
you
will
so
kindly
permit
it
give
me
great
pleasure
to
ride
with
you
and
to
make
better
friendship
it
now
occurs
to
me
that
i
have
not
yet
introduce
gentlemen
jacques
i
have
the
honor
to
be
name
i
am
delighted
to
meet

hope

bow
he
gave
the
group

of
the
old
school
big
medicine
grinned
suddenly
and
came
forward
honest
to
grandma
i
happy
to
know
yuh
he
bellowed
and
caught
the
cook
hand
in
a
grip
that
sent
him
squirming
upon
his
toes
these
here
are
my
friends
happy
jack
up
there
on
the
wagon
and
slim
and
weary
and
pink
and
cal
and
jack
bates
and
andy

and
there
more
scattered
around
here

it
comes
to
eating

cripes
and
we
like
your
cookin
fine
now
you
amble
along
to
town
and
load
up
with
the
best
there
is
huh
it
occurred
to
him
that
his
final
remarks
might
be
construed
as
giving
orders
and
he
glanced
at
weary
and
winked
to
show
that
he
meant
nothing
serious
so
long
jakie
he
added
over
his
shoulder
and
went
to
where
his
horse
waited
jacques
ever
afterward
he
was
known
as
jakie
to
the
flying
u
clambered
up
the
front
wheel
and
perched
ingratiatingly
beside
happy
jack
and
they
started
off
behind
the
riders
for
the
short
mile
to
dry
lake
immediately
he
proceeded
to
win
happy
from
his
glum
aloofness
i
would
say
mr
happy
that
i
should
like
exceeding
well
to
be
friends
together
he
began
purringly
so
superior
a
gentleman
must
win
the
admiration
of
the
onlooker
and
so
i
could
presume
to
question
for
advisement
i
am
experience
much
dexterity
for
cooking
yes
but
i
am
yet
so
ignorant
concerning
the
duties
pertaining
to
camp
if
the
driving
of
these
several
horses
transpire
to
pertain
i
will
so
gladly
receive
the
necessary
instruction
and
endeavor
to
fulfil
the
accomplishment
yes
happy
jack
more
in
stupefaction
at
the
cook
vocabulary
than
anything
else
turned
his
head
and
took
a
good
look
at
him
and
the
trustful
smile
of
jakie
went
straight
to
the
big
soft
heart
of
him
and
won
him
completely
aw
gwan
he
adjured
gruffly
to
hide
his
surrender
i
do
mind
driving
for
yuh
it
ai
that
i
was
kicking
about
i
thank
you
for
the
so
gracious
assurement
if
i
transgress
not
too
greatly
i
should
like
for
inquire
what
is
the
chuck
for
which
i
am
told
to
fill
the
wagon
i
do

he
added
humbly
understand
yet
all
the
language
of
your
so
glorious
country
for
fich
i
have
so
diligently
study
the
books
words
i
have
not

assimilated
completely
and
the
word
chuck

my
knowledge
chuck
grinned
happy
jack
is
grub
chuck
it
is
grub
repeated
jakie
thoughtfully
and
grub
that
is
yes
happy
jack
struggled
mentally
with
the
problem
well
grub
is
grub
all
the
stuff
yuh
eat
is
grub
meat
and
flour
and
coffee
and
ah
the
light
it
dawns
exclaimed
jakie
joyously
grub
it
is
the
supply
of
provision
fich
i
must
obtain
for
camping
yes
i
thank
you
so
graciously
for
the
information
because
he
added
a
bit
wistfully
that
little
word
chuck
she
annoy
me
exceeding
and
make
me
for
not
sleep
that
i
must
grasp
the
meaning
fich
elude
i
am
now
happy
that
i
do
not
make
the
extensive
blunder
for
one
small
word
fich
i
apprehend
must
be
a
food
fich
i
must
buy
and
perhaps
not
to
understand
the
preparation
of
it
yes
it
is
the
excellent
jest
at
the
expense
of
me
there
ai
much
chuck
in
camp
happy
observed
helpfully
so
yuh
might
as
well
start
in
and
get
anything
yuh
want
to
cook
the
outfit
is
good
about
one
thing
they
do
never
kick
on
the
stuff
yuh
eat
the
cook
always
loads
up
to
suit
himself
and
nobody
do
ask
questions
or
make
a
holler
so
long
as
there
plenty
and
it
good
jakie
listened
attentively
twisting
his
mustache
ends
absently
it
is
simply
that
i
purchase
the
supplies
fich
i
shall
choose
for
my
judgment
he
observed
to
make
quite
sure
that
he
understood
i
am
to
have
yes
sure
if
yuh
want
it
said
happy
jack
only
they
might
not
keep
it
here
yuh
ca
get
in
a
little
place
like
this
it
is
only
fair
to
happy
jack
to
state
that
he
would
have
understood
the
term
if
he
had
seen
it
in
print
it
was
the
pronunciation
which
made
the
words
strange
to
him
jakie
looked
puzzled
but
being
the
soul
of
politeness
he
made
no
comment
perhaps
because
happy
jack
was
at
that
moment
bringing
his
four
horses
to
a
reluctant
stand
at
the
wide
of
the
store
the
horses
they
are
of
the
vivacious
temperament
yes
jakie
had
scrambled
from
the
seat
to
within
the
door
and
was
standing
there
smiling
appreciatively
at
the
team
aw
they
all
right
you
go
on
in
i
guess
weary
there
if
he
ai
you
go
ahead
and
get
what
yuh
want
i
be
back
after
awhile
thirst
was
calling
happy
jack
he
heeded
the
summons
and
disappeared
leaving
the
new
cook
to
his
own
devices
so
it
would
seem
did
every
other
member
of
the
flying
weary
had
been
told
that
miss
satterly
was
in
town
and
he
forgot
all
about
jakie
in
his
haste
to
find
her
no
one
else
seemed
to
feel
any
responsibility
in
the
matter
and
the
store
clerks
did
not
care
what
the
flying
u
outfit
had
to
eat
for
that
reason
the
contained
in
an
hour
many
articles
which
were
strange
to
it
and
lacked
a
few
things
which
might
justly
be
called
necessities
say
you
fellows
are
sure
going
to
live
swell
one
of
the
clerks
remarked
when
happy
jack
finally
returned
where
did
yuh
pick
his
nibs
ai
he
a
little
bit
new
and
shiny
aw
he
all
right
happy
jack
defended
jealously
he
a
real
and
he
can
build
the
swellest
meals
yuh
ever
eat
patsy
cook
within
a
mile
uh
him
and
i
betche
do
keep
his
setting
around
on
the
ground
for
folks
to
tromp
on
which
proves
how
completely
jakie
had
subjugated
happy
jack
that
night
nobody
but
the
and
happy
jack
had
shown
up
at
the
boys
of
the
flying
u
dined
luxuriously
at
their
camp
upon
the
at
the
home
ranch
and
ate
things
which
they
could
not
name
but
which
pleased
wonderfully
their
palates
there
was
a
salad
to
tempt
an
epicure
and
there
was
a
pudding
the
like
of
which
they
had
never
tasted
it
had
a
french
name
which
left
them
no
wiser
than
before
asking
for
it
and
it
looked
as
pink
remarked
like
a
snowbank
with
the
sun
shining
on
it
and
it
tasted
like
going
to
heaven
it
makes
me
plumb
sore
when
i
think
of
all
the
years
i
stood
for
patsy
slops
sighed
cal
emmett
rolling
over
upon
his
back
because
he
was
too
full
for
any
other
position
putting
it
plainly
by
golly
i
never
knowed
there
was
such
cookin
in
the
world
echoed
slim
why
even
mis
bixby
ca
cook
that
good
the
countess
had
ought
to
come
down
and
take
a
few
lessons
declared
jack
bates
emphatically
i
going
to
take
up
some
uh
that
pudding
and
ask
her
what
she
thinks
of
it
yuh
ca
mourned
happy
jack
there
ai
any
left
and
i
never
got
a
taste
next
time
i
going
to
tell
jakie
to
make
it
in
a
wash
tub
and
make
it
full
with
some
uh
you
gobblers
in
camp
he
looked
up
and
discovered
the
little
doctor
approaching
with
chip
she
was
smiling
a
friendly
welcome
and
she
was
curious
about
the
new
cook
by
the
time
she
had
greeted
them
all
and
had
asked
all
the
questions
she
could
think
of
and
had
gone
over
to
meet
jakie
and
to
taste
at
the
urgent
behest
of
the
happy
family
a
tiny
morsel
of
salad
which
had
been
overlooked
it
would
seem
that
the
triumph
of
the
new
cook
was
complete
and
that
no
one
could
possibly
give
a
thought
to
old
patsy
the
little
doctor
however
seemed
to
regret
his
loss
and
that
in
the
face
of
the
delectable
salad
and
the
smile
of
jakie
i
do
think
a
shame
that
patsy
left
the
way
he
did
she
remarked
to
the
happy
family
in
general
being
especially
careful
not
to
look
toward
big
medicine
the
poor
old
fellow
every
step
of
the
way
to
the
ranch
and
claude
that
was
chip
real
name
says
it
was
or
six
miles
he
was
so
lame
and
he
looked
so
old
and
so
well
friendless
that
i
could
have
when
he
came
limping
up
to
the
house
he
had
walked
all
night
and
he
got
here
just
at
breakfast
time
and
was
too
tired
to
eat
i
dosed
him
and
doctored
his
poor
feet
and
made
him
go
to
bed
and
he
slept
all
that
day
he
wanted
to
start
that
night
for
dry
lake
but
of
course
we
would
let
him
do
that
he
was
wild
to
leave
however
so
had
to
drive
him
in
the
next
day
he
went
off
without
a
word
to
any
of
us
and
he
looked
so
utterly
dejected
and
so
so
claude
says
he
acted
perfectly
awful
in
camp
but
i
sure
he
was
sorry
for
it
afterwards
has
got
over
it
yet
i
believe
he
has
taken
it
to
heart
as
much
as
patsy
seemed
to
do
he
had
patsy
with
him
for
so
long
you
see
he
was
like
one
of
the
family
she
stopped
and
regarded
the
happy
family
a
bit
anxiously
this
new
cook
is
a
very
nice
little
man
she
added
after
a
minute
but
after
all
he
patsy
the
happy
family
did
not
answer
and
they
refrained
from
looking
at
one
another
or
at
the
little
doctor
at
last
big
medicine
brought
his
big
voice
into
the
awkward
silence
honest
to
grandma
chip
he
said
earnestly
i
give
a
lot
right
now
to
have
old
patsy
back
er
just
to
have
if
it
made
him
feel
bad
to
leave
i
reckon
maybe
that
was
my
fault
i
oughta
pitched
quite
so
hard
and
i
had
oughta
looked
where
i
was
throwin
m
rider
i
reelize
that
no
cook
likes
to
have
a
fellow
standin
on
his
head
in
a
big
pan
uh
on
general
principles
if
not
on
account
uh
the
bread
uh
course
we
all
knowed
old
patsy
to
take
just
about
as
great
liberties
himself
with
his
sponge
but
we
got
to
recollect
that
it
was
dough
by
cripes
and
that
pipe
ashes
ai
the
same
as
a
fellow
takin
a
shampoo
in
the
pan
no
i
reelize
that
i
done
wrong
and
i
willin
to
apologize
for
it
right
here
and
now
at
the
same
time
he
ended
dryly
i
will
own
that
i
dead
stuck
on
little
jakie
and
i
ruther
ride
for
the
flying
u
and
eat
jakie
grub
than
any
other
fate
i
can
think
of
right
now
whilst
i
sorry
for
what
i
done
yuh
could
pry
me
loose
from
jakie
with
a
stick
uh
dynamite
and
that
a
fact
mrs
chip
the
little
doctor
laughed
pushed
back
her
hair
in
the
way
she
had
glanced
again
at
the
unresponsive
faces
of
the
original
members
of
the
happy
family
and
gave
up
as
gracefully
as
possible
oh
of
course
patsy
an
old
crank
and
jakie
a
waxed
angel
she
surrendered
with
a
little
grimace
you
think
so
now
but
because
you
are
being
led
astray
by
your
appetites
like
all
men
you
just
wait
you
be
for
a
sight
of
that
fat
cranky
old
patsy
bouncing
along
on
the
and
swearing
in
dutch
at
his
horses
before
you
through
if
you
not
so
completely
gone
over
to
jakie
that
you
will
eat
nothing
but
what
he
has
cooked
come
on
up
to
the
house
the
countess
is
making
a
twogallon
freezer
of
for
you
and
she
has
a
big
pan
of
angel
cake
to
go
with
it
you
do
deserve
it
but
come
along
anyway
which
was
another
endearing
way
of
the
little
doctor
the
way
of
sweetening
all
her
lectures
with
something
very
nice
at
the
end
the
happy
family
felt
very
much
ashamed
and
very
sorry
that
they
could
not
feel
kindly
toward
patsy
even
to
please
the
little
doctor
they
sincerely
wanted
to
please
her
and
to
have
her
unqualified
approval
but
wanting
patsy
back
or
feeling
even
the
slightest
regret
that
he
was
gone
seemed
to
them
a
great
deal
too
much
to
ask
of
them
since
this
is
a
story
of
cooks
and
of
eating
one
may
with
propriety
add
however
that
the
invitation
to
ice
cream
and
angel
cake
coming
though
it
did
immediately
after
that
wonderful
supper
of
jakie
was
accepted
with
alacrity
and
their
usual
thoroughness
of
accomplishment
not
for
the
world
would
they
have
offended
the
little
doctor
by
declining
so
gracious
an
invitation
the
graciousness
being
manifested
in
her
smile
and
her
voice
rather
than
in
the
words
she
spoke
leaving
out
the
enchantment
which
hovers
over
the
very
name
of
angel
cake
and
ice
cream
the
happy
family
went
to
bed
that
night
as
complacently
uncomfortable
as
children
after
a
christmas
dinner
not
often
does
it
fall
to
the
lot
of
a
cowboy
to
have
served
to
him
stuffed
olives
and
lobster
salad
with
mayonnaise
dressing
french
fried
potatoes
and
cream
puffs
from
the
of
a
roundup
outfit
during
the
next
week
it
fell
to
the
lot
of
the
happy
family
however
when
the
salads
and
the
cream
puffs
disappeared
suddenly
and
the
smile
of
jakie
became
pensive
and
contrite
the
happy
family
acting
individually
but
unanimously
made
inquiries
it
is
that
i
no
more
possess
the
fresh
vegetables
nor
the
eggs
gentlemen
purred
jakie
many
things
of
a
deliciousness
must
i
now
abstain
because
of
the
absence
of
two
three
small
eggs
but
see
one
brief
arrival
in
the
small
town
would
quickly
remedy
yes
it
is
that
we
return
with
haste
that
i
may
buy
more
of
the
several
articles
for
fich
i
require
he
spread
his
small
hands
appealingly
by
golly
never
had
no
eggs
began
slim
traitorously
aw
gwan
patsy
never
fed
yuh
like
jakie
does
neither
happy
jack
was
heart
and
soul
the
slave
of
the
chef
if
chip
do
care
ride
over
to
nelson
and
git
some
eggs
jakie
said
he
make
some
more
uh
that
pudding
if
he
had
some
it
ai
but
six
or
seven
miles
should
you
but
obtain
the
juvenile
hen
yes
i
should
be
delighted
to
serve
the
chicken
salad
for
luncheon
it
is
the
great
misfortune
that
the
fresh
vegetable
are
not
obtain
but
i
will
do
the
best
and
substitute
with
a
cleverness
fich
will
conceal
the
defect
yes
jakie
caps
and
aprons
had
lost
their
first
immaculate
freshness
but
his
manner
was
as
royally
perfect
as
ever
and
his
smile
as
wistfully
friendly
well
i
ask
chip
about
it
happy
jack
yielded
eggs
and
young
chickens
were
of
a
truth
strange
to
a
roundup
in
full
blast
but
so
was
a
chef
like
jakie
and
so
were
the
salads
stuffed
olives
and
cream
puffs
and
the
white
caps
and
the
waxed
mustache
and
the
beautiful
flow
of
words
and
the
smile
the
happy
family
was
in
no
condition
mentally
or
digestively
to
judge
impartially
a
month
ago
they
would
have
whooped
derision
at
the
suggestion
of
riding
anywhere
after
fresh
eggs
and
juvenile
hens
but
now
it
seemed
to
them
very
natural
and
very
necessary
so
much
for
the
demoralization
of
expert
cookery
and
white
caps
and
a
smile
chip
also
seemed
to
have
fallen
under
the
spell
it
may
have
been
that
the
heavenly
peace
which
wrapped
the
flying
u
was
in
his
mind
too
precious
to
be
lightly
disturbed
at
any
rate
he
told
happy
jack
briefly
to
go
ahead
if
you
want
to
and
so
left
unobstructed
the
path
to
the
chicken
salad
and
cream
puffs
happy
jack
wiped
his
hands
upon
an
empty
flour
sack
rolled
down
his
shirtsleeves
and
hurried
off
to
saddle
a
horse
happy
jack
did
not
realize
that
he
was
doing
two
thirds
of
the
work
about
the
but
that
was
a
fact
because
jakie
could
not
drive
the
team
happy
jack
had
been
appointed
his
assistant
as
assistant
he
drove
the
wagon
from
one
camping
place
to
another
rustled
the
wood
peeled
the
potatoes
tended
fires
and
washed
dishes
and
did
the
thousand
things
which
do
not
require
expert
hands
and
which
in
time
of
stress
usually
falls
to
the
jakie
was
ever
smiling
and
always
promising
in
his
purring
voice
to
cook
something
new
and
delicious
and
left
with
the
leisure
which
happy
industry
gave
him
he
usually
kept
his
promise
now
mr
happy
he
would
smile
i
am
agreeable
to
place
the
confidence
in
your
so
gracious
person
that
you
prepare
the
potatoes
yes
and
that
you
attend
to
the
boiling
of
meat
and
the
unpacking
and
arrangement
of
those
necessary
furnishings
for
fich
you
possess
the
great
understanding
and
i
shall
prepare
the
so
delicious
dessert
of
the
floating
island
what
you
call
in
america
yes
our
friends
will
have
the
so
delightful
astonishment
when
they
arrive
they
shall
exclaim
and
partake
joyously
is
it
not
and
for
your
reward
mr
happy
i
shall
be
so
pleased
to
set
aside
a
very
extensive
portion
of
the
delicious
floating
island
so
that
you
can
eat
no
more
except
you
endanger
your
handsome
person
from
the
bursting
yes
and
oh
the
smile
of
him
a
man
of
sterner
stuff
than
happy
jack
would
have
fallen
before
such
guile
and
would
have
labored
willingly
nay
gladly
in
the
service
of
so
delightful
a
diplomat
as
jakie
except
for
that
willing
service
jakie
would
have
been
quite
overwhelmed
by
the
many
and
peculiar
duties
of
a
roundup
cook
he
would
have
been
perfectly
helpess
before
the
morning
and
noon
packing
of
dishes
and
food
and
the
skilful
haste
necessary
to
unpack
and
prepare
a
meal
for
fifteen
ravenous
appetites
within
the
time
limit
would
have
been
utterly
impossible
jakie
was
a
chef
trained
to
his
profession
in
kitchens
and
with
assistance
always
at
hand
which
is
a
trade
apart
from
cooking
for
a
roundup
crew
happy
jack
in
the
fulness
of
time
returned
with
the
eggs
that
is
he
returned
with
six
eggs
and
a
quart
or
two
of
a
yellowish
mixture
thickly
powdered
with
shell
he
took
the
pail
to
jakie
and
he
saw
the
seraphic
smile
fade
from
his
face
and
an
unpleasant
glitter
creep
into
his
eyes
it
is
the
omelet
fich
you
furnish
yes
the
six
eggs
they
will
not
make
the
pudding
the
omelet
i
do
not
perceive
yet
the
desirableness
of
the
omelet
and
the
juvenile
hen
yes
aw
they
would
sell
no
chickens
happy
jack
face
had
gone
long
and
scarlet
before
the
patent
displeasure
of
the
other
and
my
horse
was
scared
uh
the
bucket
and
pitched
with
me
jackie
looked
again
into
the
pail
felt
gingerly
the
yellow
mess
and
discovered
one
more
egg
which
retained
some
semblance
of
its
original
form
the
misfortune
distresses
me
he
murmured
it
is
that
you
return
hastily
mr
happy
and
procure
other
eggs
fich
you
will
place
unbroken
in
my
waiting
hands
yes
happy
jack
mopped
his
forehead
and
glanced
at
the
sun
burning
hotly
down
upon
the
prairie
they
had
made
a
short
move
that
day
and
it
was
still
early
but
the
way
to
nelson
and
back
had
been
hot
and
tumultuous
and
he
was
tired
for
the
first
time
since
his
abject
surrender
to
the
waxed
smile
happy
jack
chafed
a
bit
under
the
yoke
of
voluntary
servitude
aw
ca
yuh
cook
something
that
do
take
so
many
eggs
he
asked
in
something
like
his
old
argumentative
tone
the
unpleasant
glitter
in
the
eyes
of
jakie
grew
more
pronounced
grew
even
snaky
in
the
opinion
of
happy
jack
it
is
that
i
am
no
more
permitted
the
privilege
of
preparing
the
food
for
fich
i
have
the
judgment
yes
his
voice
purred
too
much
to
be
convincing
it
is
that
i
am
no
more
the
chef
to
be
obeyed
by
my
servant
aw
gwan
i
ai
anybody
servant
that
i
ever
heard
of
happy
jack
felt
himself
bewilderedly
slipping
from
his
loyalty
what
had
come
over
jakie
to
act
like
this
he
walked
away
to
where
there
was
some
shade
and
sat
down
sullenly
jakie
servant
was
he
well
the
darned
little
runt
he
mumbled
rebelliously
and
immediately
felt
the
better
for
it
two
cigarettes
brought
coolness
and
calm
happy
jack
wanted
very
much
to
lie
there
and
take
a
nap
but
his
conscience
stirred
uneasily
the
boys
were
making
a
long
circle
that
day
and
would
come
in
with
the
appetites
and
the
tempers
of
wolves
it
occurred
to
happy
jack
that
their
appetites
were
much
keener
than
they
had
ever
been
before
and
he
sat
there
a
little
longer
while
he
thought
about
it
for
happy
jack
mind
was
slow
and
tenacious
and
he
hated
to
leave
a
new
idea
until
he
had
squeezed
it
dry
of
all
mystery
he
watched
jakie
moving
in
desultory
fashion
about
the
tent
but
most
of
the
time
jakie
stayed
inside
i
betche
the
boys
ai
gitting
enough
old
chuck
he
decided
at
length
floatin
island
and
stuffed
olives
for
them
that
likes
stuffed
olives
and
salad
and
all
that
junk
good
but
i
betche
the
boys
need
a
good
feed
uh
beans
which
certainly
was
brilliant
of
happy
jack
even
if
it
did
take
him
a
full
hour
to
arrive
at
that
conclusion
he
got
up
immediately
and
started
for
the
say
jakie
he
began
before
he
was
inside
ai
there
time
enough
to
boil
a
pot
uh
beans
if
i
make
yuh
a
good
fire
i
betche
the
boys
would
like
a
good
feed
happy
jack
insisted
afterward
that
it
sounded
like
the
snarling
of
a
wolf
over
a
bone
is
it
that
you
come
here
to
give
the
orders
is
it
that
you
followed
a
torrent
of
molten
french
as
it
were
followed
also
jakie
with
the
eyes
of
a
snake
and
the
toothy
grin
of
a
wild
animal
and
with
a
knife
which
happy
jack
had
never
seen
before
a
knife
which
caught
the
sunlight
and
glittered
horridly
happy
jack
backed
out
as
if
he
had
inadvertently
stirred
a
nest
of
hornets
jakie
almost
caught
him
before
he
took
to
his
heels
happy
never
waited
to
discover
what
the
new
cook
was
saying
or
whether
he
was
following
or
remaining
at
the
tent
he
headed
straight
for
the
protection
of
the
who
watched
his
cavvy
not
far
away
and
his
face
was
the
color
of
stale
putty
the
saw
him
coming
and
came
loping
up
to
meet
him
what
eating
yuh
happy
he
inquired
inelegantly
jakie
he
gone
nutty
he
come
at
me
with
a
knife
and
he
uh
killed
me
if
i
stayed
happy
jack
pantingly
recovered
himself
i
did
have
no
time
ta
git
my
gun
he
added
in
a
more
natural
tone
or
i
uh
settled
him
pretty
blame
quick
so
i
come
out
to
borrow
yourn
i
betche
have
the
next
move
the
grinned
heartlessly
i
reckon
he
about
half
shot
he
said
sliding
over
in
the
saddle
and
getting
out
the
inevitable
tobacco
sack
and
papers
old
pete
williams
rode
past
while
you
were
gone
loaded
to
the
guards
and
with
a
bottle
uh
whisky
in
each
and
two
in
his
coat
he
gave
me
a
drink
and
then
he
went
on
and
stopped
at
camp
he
was
hung
up
there
for
quite
a
spell
i
noticed
i
did
him
pass
any
uh
the
vile
liquor
to
little
jakie
but
he
twirled
a
blackened
match
stub
in
his
fingers
and
then
tossed
it
from
him
aw
gwan
jakie
would
touch
nothing
when
he
was
in
town
happy
jack
objected
i
betche
he
gone
crazy
or
else
well
interrupted
the
i
told
yuh
what
i
know
and
all
i
know
take
it
or
leave
it
he
rode
back
to
turn
the
from
climbing
a
ridge
where
he
did
not
want
the
herd
to
follow
he
did
not
lend
happy
jack
his
gun
and
for
that
reason
perhaps
jakie
remained
alive
and
unpunctured
until
the
first
of
the
riders
came
loping
in
to
camp
the
first
riders
happened
to
be
pink
and
big
medicine
they
were
met
by
a
tearful
contrite
jakie
a
jakie
who
seemed
much
inclined
to
weeping
upon
their
and
to
confessing
all
his
sins
particularly
the
sin
of
trying
to
carve
happy
jack
that
perturbed
gentleman
made
his
irate
appearance
as
soon
as
he
found
that
reinforcements
had
arrived
big
medicine
disengaged
himself
from
the
clinging
arms
of
the
chef
sniffed
suspiciously
and
wiped
away
the
tears
from
his
vest
well
say
he
bellowed
in
his
usual
manner
of
trying
to
make
all
chouteau

wept
jakie
steadying
himself
against
the
while
he
wiped
his
eyes
upon
his
apron
because
of
it
i
could
not
prepare
the
floating
island
and
without
the
dessert
i
have
not
the
heart
to

is
that
i

breaking
of
the
heart
that
i
assail
the
good
friend
of
me
oh
mr
happy
it
is
that
i
crave
pardon
happy
jack
came
near
taking
to
his
heels
again
when
he
saw
jakie
start
for
him
he
did
back
up
hastily
and
his
evident
reluctance
to
embrace
and
forgive
started
afresh
the
tears
of
remorse
jakie
wailed
volubly
and
catching
pink
unaware
he
wept
upon
his
bosom
others
came
riding
in
saw
the
huddle
before
the
and
came
up
to
investigate
with
every
fresh
arrival
jakie
began
anew
his
confession
that
he
had
attempted
to
murder
his
good
friend
mr
happy
and
with
every
confession
he
wept
more
copiously
than
before
the
happy
family
tacitly
owned
itself
helpless
a
warlike
cook
they
could
deal
with
a
lazy
cook
they
could
kick
into
industry
a
weeping
wailing
cook
a
cook
who
steadfastly
refused
to
be
comforted
was
an
absolutely
new
experience
they
told
him
to
buck
up
found
that
he
only
broke
out
anew
threatened
cajoled
and
argued
jakie
clung
to
whoever
happened
to
be
within
reach
and
mixed
the
english
language
unmercifully
happy
you
have
to
forgive
him
said
weary
at
last
go
tell
him
yuh
do
feel
hard
towards
him
we
want
some
supper
aw
gwan
i
forgive
him
and
i
never
will
i
big
medicine
stepped
into
the
breach
with
his
face
contorted
into
a
grin
to
crimple
one
spine
with
a
voice
to
make
one
knees
buckle
he
went
up
to
happy
jack
and
thrust
that
horrible
grin
into
very
face
by
cripes
you
forgive
jakie
and
you
do
it
quick
he
thundered
think
you
going
to
ball
up
the
eating
uh
the
whole
outfit
whilst
you
stand
around
acting
haughty
why
by
cripes
killed
men
in
the
coconino
county
for
what
you
doing
wish
by
cripes
that
jakie
slit
your
hide
you
consider
that
woulda
been
an
easy
way
out
before

git
half
through
with
yuh
you
walk
right
up
and
shake
hands
with
him
and
you
tell
him
that
yuh
love
him
to
death
and
are
his
best
friend
and
always
will
be
yuh
me
happy
jack
heard
the
happy
family
considerately
moved
aside
and
left
him
a
clear
path
and
they
looked
on
without
a
word
while
he
took
jakie
limp
hand
muttered
tremulously
aw
fergit
it
jakie
i
know
yuh
did
mean
nothing
by
it
and
i
forgive
yuh
and
backed
away
again
jakie
wept
this
time
with
gratitude
they
got
him
inside
a
tent
unrolled
his
bed
and
persuaded
him
to
lie
down
upon
it
they
searched
the
found
all
that
was
left
of
a
quart
bottle
of
whisky
took
it
outside
and
divided
it
gravely
and
appreciatively
among
themselves
there
was
not
much
to
divide
happy
jack
took
charge
of
the
pots
and
pans
with
the
whole
happy
family
to
help
him
hurry
supper
while
jakie
forgot
his
woes
in
sleep
and
the
sun
set
upon
a
quiet
camp
next
morning
jakie
was
up
and
cooking
breakfast
at
the
appointed
time
and
the
camp
felt
that
the
incident
of
the
evening
before
might
well
be
forgotten
the
coffee
was
unusually
good
that
morning
even
for
jakie
he
was
subdued
was
jakie
and
his
soft
brown
eyes
were
humble
whenever
they
met
the
eyes
of
happy
jack
his
smile
was
infrequent
and
fleeting
and
his
voice
more
deprecating
than
ever
aside
from
these
minor
changes
everything
seemed
the
same
as
before
the
sheepmen
had
stopped
at
camp
that
afternoon
however
came
an
aftermath
in
the
shape
of
happy
jack
galloping
wildly
out
to
where
the
others
were
holding
a
herd
and
cutting
out
he
was
due
to
come
and
help
so
nobody
paid
any
attention
to
his
haste
though
it
was
his
habit
to
take
his
time
he
shot
recklessly
by
the
outer
fringes
of
the
cut
and
yelled
in
a
way
to
stampede
the
whole
bunch
jakie
he
shouted
he
drunk
up
all
the
lemon
extract
and
most
uh
the
before
i
could
stop
him
chip
and
weary
riding
in
hot
haste
to
the
camp
found
that
it
was
true
as
far
as
the
drinking
was
concerned
jakie
was
stretched
upon
his
back
breathing
unpleasantly
and
beside
him
were
two
flat
bottles
of
size
one
empty
and
the
other
very
nearly
so
the
tent
and
jakie
breath
reeked
of
lemon
and
vanilla
chip
sent
back
for
help
for
the
second
time
the
flying
u
roundup
was
brought
to
an
involuntary
pause
because
of
its
cook
there
was
but
one
thing
to
do
and
chip
did
it
he
broke
camp
loaded
jakie
into
the
and
headed
at
a
gallop
for
dry
lake
in
an
effort
to
catch
the
next
train
for
great
falls
whether
he
sent
jakie
to
the
hospital
or
to
the
undertaker
was
a
question
he
did
not
attempt
to
answer
one
thing
was
certain
however
that
he
must
send
him
to
one
of
those
places
as
soon
as
might
be
that
night
just
before
the
train
arrived
he
sent
another
telegram
to
johnny
scott
at
rush
rates
he
said
simply
send
another
cook
immediately
this
one
all
in
am
returning
him
in
baggage
coach
this
train
c
bennett
just
after
midnight
he
went
to
the
station
and
received
an
answer
which
is
worth
repeating
bennett

it

which
accounts
perhaps
for
the
facetious
remarks
which
it
contained
it
was
morning
when
that
train
arrived
because
it
was
behind
time
for
some
reason
but
