women
will
always
go
on
trying
to

even
when
the

seems
to

no
future
the
coupe
with
the
fishhooks
welded
to
the
fender
shouldered
up
over
the
curb
like
the
nose
of
a
nightmare
the
girl
in
its
path
stood
frozen
her
face
probably
stiff
with
fright
under
her
mask
for
once
my
reflexes
were
shy
i
took
a
fast
step
toward
her
grabbed
her
elbow
yanked
her
back
her
black
skirt
swirled
out
the
big
coupe
shot
by
its
turbine
humming
i
glimpsed
three
faces
something
ripped
i
felt
the
hot
exhaust
on
my
ankles
as
the
big
coupe
swerved
back
into
the
street
a
thick
cloud
like
a
black
flower
blossomed
from
its
jouncing
rear
end
while
from
the
fishhooks
flew
a
black
shimmering
rag
did
they
get
you
i
asked
the
girl
she
had
twisted
around
to
look
where
the
side
of
her
skirt
was
torn
away
she
was
wearing
nylon
tights
the
hooks
did
touch
me
she
said
shakily
i
guess
i
lucky
i
heard
voices
around
us
those
kids
what
they
think
up
next
they
a
menace
they
ought
to
be
arrested
sirens
screamed
at
a
rising
pitch
as
two
their
jets
full
on
came
whizzing
toward
us
after
the
coupe
but
the
black
flower
had
become
a
thick
fog
obscuring
the
whole
street
the
switched
from
rocket
assists
to
rocket
brakes
and
swerved
to
a
stop
near
the
smoke
cloud
are
you
english
the
girl
asked
me
you
have
an
english
accent
her
voice
came
shudderingly
from
behind
the
sleek
black
satin
mask
i
fancied
her
teeth
must
be
chattering
eyes
that
were
perhaps
blue
searched
my
face
from
behind
the
black
gauze
covering
the
eyeholes
of
the
mask
i
told
her
she
guessed
right
she
stood
close
to
me
will
you
come
to
my
place
tonight
she
asked
rapidly
i
ca
thank
you
now
and
there
something
you
can
help
me
about
my
arm
still
lightly
circling
her
waist
felt
her
body
trembling
i
was
answering
the
plea
in
that
as
much
as
in
her
voice
when
i
said
certainly
she
gave
me
an
address
south
of
inferno
an
apartment
number
and
a
time
she
asked
me
my
name
and
i
told
her
hey
you
i
turned
obediently
to
the
policeman
shout
he
shooed
away
the
small
clucking
crowd
of
masked
women
and
barefaced
men
coughing
from
the
smoke
that
the
black
coupe
had
thrown
out
he
asked
for
my
papers
i
handed
him
the
essential
ones
he
looked
at
them
and
then
at
me
british
barter
how
long
will
you
be
in
new
york
suppressing
the
urge
to
say
for
as
short
a
time
as
possible
i
told
him
i
be
here
for
a
week
or
so
may
need
you
as
a
witness
he
explained
those
kids
ca
use
smoke
on
us
when
they
do
that
we
pull
them
in
he
seemed
to
think
the
smoke
was
the
bad
thing
they
tried
to
kill
the
lady
i
pointed
out
he
shook
his
head
wisely
they
always
pretend
they
going
to
but
actually
they
just
want
to
snag
skirts
i
picked
up
rippers
with
as
many
as
fifty
tacked
up
in
their
rooms
of
course
sometimes
they
come
a
little
too
close
i
explained
that
if
i
had
yanked
her
out
of
the
way
she
have
been
hit
by
more
than
hooks
but
he
interrupted
if
she
thought
it
was
a
real
murder
attempt
she
have
stayed
here
i
looked
around
it
was
true
she
was
gone
she
was
fearfully
frightened
i
told
him
who
would
be
those
kids
would
have
scared
old
stalin
himself
i
mean
frightened
of
more
than
they
did
look
like
what
did
they
look
like
i
tried
without
much
success
to
describe
the
three
faces
a
vague
impression
of
viciousness
and
effeminacy
does
mean
much
well
i
could
be
wrong
he
said
finally
do
you
know
the
girl
where
she
lives
no
i
half
lied
the
other
policeman
hung
up
his
radiophone
and
ambled
toward
us
kicking
at
the
tendrils
of
dissipating
smoke
the
black
cloud
no
longer
hid
the
dingy
facades
with
their
radiation
and
i
could
begin
to
make
out
the
distant
stump
of
the
empire
state
building
thrusting
up
out
of
inferno
like
a
mangled
finger
they
have
been
picked
up
so
far
the
approaching
policeman
grumbled
left
smoke
for
five
blocks
from
what
ryan
says
the
first
policeman
shook
his
head
that
bad
he
observed
solemnly
i
was
feeling
a
bit
uneasy
and
ashamed
an
englishman
should
lie
at
least
not
on
impulse
they
sound
like
nasty
customers
the
first
policeman
continued
in
the
same
grim
tone
we
need
witnesses
looks
as
if
you
may
have
to
stay
in
new
york
longer
than
you
expect
i
got
the
point
i
said
i
forgot
to
show
you
all
my
papers
and
handed
him
a
few
others
making
sure
there
was
a
five
dollar
bill
in
among
them
when
he
handed
them
back
a
bit
later
his
voice
was
no
longer
ominous
my
feelings
of
guilt
vanished
to
cement
our
relationship
i
chatted
with
the
two
of
them
about
their
job
i
suppose
the
masks
give
you
some
trouble
i
observed
over
in
england
we
been
reading
about
your
new
crop
of
masked
female
bandits
those
things
get
exaggerated
the
first
policeman
assured
me
the
men
masking
as
women
that
really
mix
us
up
but
brother
when
we
nab
them
we
jump
on
them
with
both
feet
and
you
get
so
you
can
spot
women
almost
as
well
as
if
they
had
naked
faces
the
second
policeman
volunteered
you
know
hands
and
all
that
especially
all
that
the
first
agreed
with
a
chuckle
say
is
it
true
that
some
girls
do
mask
over
in
england
a
number
of
them
have
picked
up
the
fashion
i
told
him
only
a
few
though
the
ones
who
always
adopt
the
latest
style
however
extreme
they
usually
masked
in
the
british
newscasts
i
imagine
it
arranged
that
way
out
of
deference
to
american
taste
i
confessed
actually
not
very
many
do
mask
the
second
policeman
considered
that
girls
going
down
the
street
bare
from
the
neck
up
it
was
not
clear
whether
he
viewed
the
prospect
with
relish
or
moral
distaste
likely
both
a
few
members
keep
trying
to
persuade
parliament
to
enact
a
law
forbidding
all
masking
i
continued
talking
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
the
second
policeman
shook
his
head
what
an
idea
you
know
masks
are
a
pretty
good
thing
brother
couple
of
years
more
and
i
going
to
make
my
wife
wear
hers
around
the
house
the
first
policeman
shrugged
if
women
were
to
stop
wearing
masks
in
six
weeks
you
would
know
the
difference
you
get
used
to
anything
if
enough
people
do
or
do
do
it
i
agreed
rather
regretfully
and
left
them
i
turned
north
on
broadway
old
tenth
avenue
i
believe
and
walked
rapidly
until
i
was
beyond
inferno
passing
such
an
area
of
undecontaminated
radioactivity
always
makes
a
person
queasy
i
thanked
god
there
were
any
such
in
england
as
yet
the
street
was
almost
empty
though
i
was
accosted
by
a
couple
of
beggars
with
faces
tunneled
by
scars
whether
real
or
of
makeup
putty
i
could
tell
a
fat
woman
held
out
a
baby
with
webbed
fingers
and
toes
i
told
myself
it
would
have
been
deformed
anyway
and
that
she
was
only
capitalizing
on
our
fear
of
mutations
still
i
gave
her
a
piece
her
mask
made
me
feel
i
was
paying
tribute
to
an
african
fetish
may
all
your
children
be
blessed
with
one
head
and
two
eyes
sir
thanks
i
said
shuddering
and
hurried
past
her
there
only
trash
behind
the
mask
so
turn
your
head
stick
to
your
task
stay
away
stay
away
from
the
girls
this
last
was
the
end
of
an
song
being
sung
by
some
religionists
half
a
block
from
the
insignia
of
a
femalist
temple
they
reminded
me
only
faintly
of
our
small
tribe
of
british
monastics
above
their
heads
was
a
jumble
of
billboards
advertising
predigested
foods
wrestling
instruction
radio
handies
and
the
like
i
stared
at
the
hysterical
slogans
with
disagreeable
fascination
since
the
female
face
and
form
have
been
banned
on
american
signs
the
very
letters
of
the
advertiser
alphabet
have
begun
to
crawl
with
sex
the
capital
b
the
lascivious
double
o
however
i
reminded
myself
it
is
chiefly
the
mask
that
so
strangely
accents
sex
in
america
a
british
anthropologist
has
pointed
out
that
while
it
took
more
than
years
to
shift
the
chief
point
of
sexual
interest
from
the
hips
to
the
breasts
the
next
transition
to
the
face
has
taken
less
than
years
comparing
the
american
style
with
moslem
tradition
is
not
valid
moslem
women
are
compelled
to
wear
veils
the
purpose
of
which
is
concealment
while
american
women
have
only
the
compulsion
of
fashion
and
use
masks
to
create
mystery
theory
aside
the
actual
origins
of
the
trend
are
to
be
found
in
the
clothing
of
world
war
iii
which
led
to
masked
wrestling
now
a
fantastically
popular
sport
and
that
in
turn
led
to
the
current
female
fashion
only
a
wild
style
at
first
masks
quickly
became
as
necessary
as
brassieres
and
lipsticks
had
been
earlier
in
the
century
i
finally
realized
that
i
was
not
speculating
about
masks
in
general
but
about
what
lay
behind
one
in
particular
that
the
devil
of
the
things
you
never
sure
whether
a
girl
is
heightening
loveliness
or
hiding
ugliness
i
pictured
a
cool
pretty
face
in
which
fear
showed
only
in
widened
eyes
then
i
remembered
her
blonde
hair
rich
against
the
blackness
of
the
satin
mask
she
told
me
to
come
at
the
hour
ten
i
climbed
to
my
apartment
near
the
british
consulate
the
elevator
shaft
had
been
shoved
out
of
plumb
by
an
old
blast
a
nuisance
in
these
tall
new
york
buildings
before
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
would
be
going
out
again
i
automatically
tore
a
tab
from
the
film
strip
under
my
shirt
i
developed
it
just
to
be
sure
it
showed
that
the
total
radiation
i
taken
that
day
was
still
within
the
safety
limit
not
phobic
about
it
as
so
many
people
are
these
days
but
there
no
point
in
taking
chances
i
flopped
down
on
the
day
bed
and
stared
at
the
silent
speaker
and
the
dark
screen
of
the
video
set
as
always
they
made
me
think
somewhat
bitterly
of
the
two
great
nations
of
the
world
mutilated
by
each
other
yet
still
strong
they
were
crippled
giants
poisoning
the
planet
with
their
dreams
of
an
impossible
equality
and
an
impossible
success
i
fretfully
switched
on
the
speaker
by
luck
the
newscaster
was
talking
excitedly
of
the
prospects
of
a
bumper
wheat
crop
sown
by
planes
across
a
dust
bowl
moistened
by
seeded
rains
i
listened
carefully
to
the
rest
of
the
program
it
was
remarkably
clear
of
russian
telejamming
but
there
was
no
further
news
of
interest
to
me
and
of
course
no
mention
of
the
moon
though
everyone
knows
that
america
and
russia
are
racing
to
develop
their
primary
bases
into
fortresses
capable
of
mutual
assault
and
the
launching
of
toward
earth
i
myself
knew
perfectly
well
that
the
british
electronic
equipment
i
was
helping
trade
for
american
wheat
was
destined
for
use
in
spaceships
i
switched
off
the
newscast
it
was
growing
dark
and
once
again
i
pictured
a
tender
frightened
face
behind
a
mask
i
had
had
a
date
since
england
it
exceedingly
difficult
to
become
acquainted
with
a
girl
in
america
where
as
little
as
a
smile
often
can
set
one
of
them
yelping
for
the
police
to
say
nothing
of
the
increasing
puritanical
morality
and
the
roving
gangs
that
keep
most
women
indoors
after
dark
and
naturally
the
masks
which
are
definitely
not
as
the
soviets
claim
a
last
invention
of
capitalist
degeneracy
but
a
sign
of
great
psychological
insecurity
the
russians
have
no
masks
but
they
have
their
own
signs
of
stress
i
went
to
the
window
and
impatiently
watched
the
darkness
gather
i
was
getting
very
restless
after
a
while
a
ghostly
violet
cloud
appeared
to
the
south
my
hair
rose
then
i
laughed
i
had
momentarily
fancied
it
a
radiation
from
the
crater
of
the
though
i
should
instantly
have
known
it
was
only
the
glow
in
the
sky
over
the
amusement
and
residential
area
south
of
inferno
promptly
at
hours
i
stood
before
the
door
of
my
unknown
girl
friend
apartment
the
electronic
said
just
that
i
answered
clearly
wysten
turner
wondering
if
she
given
my
name
to
the
mechanism
she
evidently
had
for
the
door
opened
i
walked
into
a
small
empty
living
room
my
heart
pounding
a
bit
the
room
was
expensively
furnished
with
the
latest
pneumatic
hassocks
and
sprawlers
there
were
some
midgie
books
on
the
table
the
one
i
picked
up
was
the
standard
detective
story
in
which
two
female
murderers
go
gunning
for
each
other
the
television
was
on
a
masked
girl
in
green
was
crooning
a
love
song
her
right
hand
held
something
that
blurred
off
into
the
foreground
i
saw
the
set
had
a
handie
which
we
have
in
england
as
yet
and
curiously
thrust
my
hand
into
the
handie
orifice
beside
the
screen
contrary
to
my
expectations
it
was
not
like
slipping
into
a
pulsing
rubber
glove
but
rather
as
if
the
girl
on
the
screen
actually
held
my
hand
a
door
opened
behind
me
i
jerked
out
my
hand
with
as
guilty
a
reaction
as
if
i
been
caught
peering
through
a
keyhole
she
stood
in
the
bedroom
doorway
i
think
she
was
trembling
she
was
wearing
a
gray
fur
coat
and
a
gray
velvet
evening
mask
with
shirred
gray
lace
around
the
eyes
and
mouth
her
fingernails
twinkled
like
silver
it
had
occurred
to
me
that
she
expect
us
to
go
out
i
should
have
told
you
she
said
softly
her
mask
veered
nervously
toward
the
books
and
the
screen
and
the
room
dark
corners
but
i
ca
possibly
talk
to
you
here
i
said
doubtfully
there
a
place
near
the
consulate
i
know
where
we
can
be
together
and
talk
she
said
rapidly
if
you
do
mind
as
we
entered
the
elevator
i
said
i
afraid
i
dismissed
the
cab
but
the
cab
driver
had
gone
for
some
reason
of
his
own
he
jumped
out
and
smirkingly
held
the
front
door
open
for
us
i
told
him
we
preferred
to
sit
in
back
he
sulkily
opened
the
rear
door
slammed
it
after
us
jumped
in
front
and
slammed
the
door
behind
him
my
companion
leaned
forward
heaven
she
said
the
driver
switched
on
the
turbine
and
televisor
why
did
you
ask
if
i
were
a
british
subject
i
said
to
start
the
conversation
she
leaned
away
from
me
tilting
her
mask
close
to
the
window
see
the
moon
she
said
in
a
quick
dreamy
voice
but
why
really
i
pressed
conscious
of
an
irritation
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
it
edging
up
into
the
purple
of
the
sky
and
what
your
name
the
purple
makes
it
look
yellower
just
then
i
became
aware
of
the
source
of
my
irritation
it
lay
in
the
square
of
writhing
light
in
the
front
of
the
cab
beside
the
driver
i
do
object
to
ordinary
wrestling
matches
though
they
bore
me
but
i
simply
detest
watching
a
man
wrestle
a
woman
the
fact
that
the
bouts
are
generally
on
the
level
with
the
man
greatly
outclassed
in
weight
and
reach
and
the
masked
females
young
and
personable
only
makes
them
seem
worse
to
me
please
turn
off
the
screen
i
requested
the
driver
he
shook
his
head
without
looking
around
man
he
said
they
been
grooming
that
babe
for
weeks
for
this
bout
with
little
zirk
infuriated
i
reached
forward
but
my
companion
caught
my
arm
please
she
whispered
frightenedly
shaking
her
head
i
settled
back
frustrated
she
was
closer
to
me
now
but
silent
and
for
a
few
moments
i
watched
the
heaves
and
contortions
of
the
powerful
masked
girl
and
her
wiry
masked
opponent
on
the
screen
his
frantic
scrambling
at
her
reminded
me
of
a
male
spider
i
jerked
around
facing
my
companion
why
did
those
three
men
want
to
kill
you
i
asked
sharply
the
eyeholes
of
her
mask
faced
the
screen
because
they
jealous
of
me
she
whispered
why
are
they
jealous
she
still
did
look
at
me
because
of
him
who
she
did
answer
i
put
my
arm
around
her
shoulders
are
you
afraid
to
tell
me
i
asked
what
the
matter
she
still
did
look
my
way
she
smelled
nice
see
here
i
said
laughingly
changing
my
tactics
you
really
should
tell
me
something
about
yourself
i
do
even
know
what
you
look
like
i
half
playfully
lifted
my
hand
to
the
band
of
her
neck
she
gave
it
an
astonishingly
swift
slap
i
pulled
it
away
in
sudden
pain
there
were
four
tiny
indentations
on
the
back
from
one
of
them
a
tiny
bead
of
blood
welled
out
as
i
watched
i
looked
at
her
silver
fingernails
and
saw
they
were
actually
delicate
and
pointed
metal
caps
i
dreadfully
sorry
i
heard
her
say
but
you
frightened
me
i
thought
for
a
moment
you
were
going
to
at
last
she
turned
to
me
her
coat
had
fallen
open
her
evening
dress
was
cretan
revival
a
bodice
of
lace
beneath
and
supporting
the
breasts
without
covering
them
do
be
angry
she
said
putting
her
arms
around
my
neck
you
were
wonderful
this
afternoon
the
soft
gray
velvet
of
her
mask
molding
itself
to
her
cheek
pressed
mine
through
the
mask
lace
the
wet
warm
tip
of
her
tongue
touched
my
chin
i
not
angry
i
said
just
puzzled
and
anxious
to
help
the
cab
stopped
to
either
side
were
black
windows
bordered
by
spears
of
broken
glass
the
sickly
purple
light
showed
a
few
ragged
figures
slowly
moving
toward
us
the
driver
muttered
it
the
turbine
man
we
grounded
he
sat
there
hunched
and
motionless
wish
it
had
happened
somewhere
else
my
companion
whispered
five
dollars
is
the
usual
amount
she
looked
out
so
shudderingly
at
the
congregating
figures
that
i
suppressed
my
indignation
and
did
as
she
suggested
the
driver
took
the
bill
without
a
word
as
he
started
up
he
put
his
hand
out
the
window
and
i
heard
a
few
coins
clink
on
the
pavement
my
companion
came
back
into
my
arms
but
her
mask
faced
the
television
screen
where
the
tall
girl
had
just
pinned
the
convulsively
kicking
little
zirk
i
so
frightened
she
breathed
heaven
turned
out
to
be
an
equally
ruinous
neighborhood
but
it
had
a
club
with
an
awning
and
a
huge
doorman
uniformed
like
a
spaceman
but
in
gaudy
colors
in
my
sensuous
daze
i
rather
liked
it
all
we
stepped
out
of
the
cab
just
as
a
drunken
old
woman
came
down
the
sidewalk
her
mask
awry
a
couple
ahead
of
us
turned
their
heads
from
the
half
revealed
face
as
if
from
an
ugly
body
at
the
beach
as
we
followed
them
in
i
heard
the
doorman
say
get
along
grandma
and
watch
yourself
inside
everything
was
dimness
and
blue
glows
she
had
said
we
could
talk
here
but
i
did
see
how
besides
the
inevitable
chorus
of
sneezes
and
coughs
they
say
america
is
fifty
per
cent
allergic
these
days
there
was
a
band
going
full
blast
in
the
latest
robop
style
in
which
an
electronic
composing
machine
selects
an
arbitrary
sequence
of
tones
into
which
the
musicians
weave
their
raucous
little
individualities
most
of
the
people
were
in
booths
the
band
was
behind
the
bar
on
a
small
platform
beside
them
a
girl
was
dancing
stripped
to
her
mask
the
little
cluster
of
men
at
the
shadowy
far
end
of
the
bar
looking
at
her
we
inspected
the
menu
in
gold
script
on
the
wall
and
pushed
the
buttons
for
breast
of
chicken
fried
shrimps
and
two
scotches
moments
later
the
serving
bell
tinkled
i
opened
the
gleaming
panel
and
took
out
our
drinks
the
cluster
of
men
at
the
bar
filed
off
toward
the
door
but
first
they
stared
around
the
room
my
companion
had
just
thrown
back
her
coat
their
look
lingered
on
our
booth
i
noticed
that
there
were
three
of
them
the
band
chased
off
the
dancing
girl
with
growls
i
handed
my
companion
a
straw
and
we
sipped
our
drinks
you
wanted
me
to
help
you
about
something
i
said
incidentally
i
think
you
lovely
she
nodded
quick
thanks
looked
around
leaned
forward
would
it
be
hard
for
me
to
get
to
england
no
i
replied
a
bit
taken
aback
provided
you
have
an
american
passport
are
they
difficult
to
get
rather
i
said
surprised
at
her
lack
of
information
your
country
does
like
its
nationals
to
travel
though
it
is
quite
as
stringent
as
russia
could
the
british
consulate
help
me
get
a
passport
it
hardly
their
could
you
i
realized
we
were
being
inspected
a
man
and
two
girls
had
paused
opposite
our
table
the
girls
were
tall
and
with
spangled
masks
the
man
stood
jauntily
between
them
like
a
fox
on
its
hind
legs
my
companion
did
glance
at
them
but
she
sat
back
i
noticed
that
one
of
the
girls
had
a
big
yellow
bruise
on
her
forearm
after
a
moment
they
walked
to
a
booth
in
the
deep
shadows
know
them
i
asked
she
did
reply
i
finished
my
drink
i
not
sure
you
like
england
i
said
the
austerity
altogether
different
from
your
american
brand
of
misery
she
leaned
forward
again
but
i
must
get
away
she
whispered
why
i
was
getting
impatient
because
i
so
frightened
there
were
chimes
i
opened
the
panel
and
handed
her
the
fried
shrimps
the
sauce
on
my
breast
of
chicken
was
a
delicious
steaming
compound
of
almonds
soy
and
ginger
but
something
must
have
been
wrong
with
the
radionic
oven
that
had
thawed
and
heated
it
for
at
the
first
bite
i
crunched
a
kernel
of
ice
in
the
meat
these
delicate
mechanisms
need
constant
repair
and
there
are
enough
mechanics
i
put
down
my
fork
what
are
you
really
scared
of
i
asked
her
for
once
her
mask
did
waver
away
from
my
face
as
i
waited
i
could
feel
the
fears
gathering
without
her
naming
them
tiny
dark
shapes
swarming
through
the
curved
night
outside
converging
on
the
radioactive
pest
spot
of
new
york
dipping
into
the
margins
of
the
purple
i
felt
a
sudden
rush
of
sympathy
a
desire
to
protect
the
girl
opposite
me
the
warm
feeling
added
itself
to
the
infatuation
engendered
in
the
cab
everything
she
said
finally
i
nodded
and
touched
her
hand
i
afraid
of
the
moon
she
began
her
voice
going
dreamy
and
brittle
as
it
had
in
the
cab
you
ca
look
at
it
and
not
think
of
guided
bombs
it
the
same
moon
over
england
i
reminded
her
but
it
not
england
moon
any
more
it
ours
and
russia
not
responsible
i
pressed
her
hand
oh
and
then
she
said
with
a
tilt
of
her
mask
i
afraid
of
the
cars
and
the
gangs
and
the
loneliness
and
inferno
i
afraid
of
the
lust
that
undresses
your
face
and
her
voice
hushed
i
afraid
of
the
wrestlers
yes
i
prompted
softly
after
a
moment
her
mask
came
forward
do
you
know
something
about
the
wrestlers
she
asked
rapidly
the
ones
that
wrestle
women
i
mean
they
often
lose
you
know
and
then
they
have
to
have
a
girl
to
take
their
frustration
out
on
a
girl
who
soft
and
weak
and
terribly
frightened
they
need
that
to
keep
them
men
other
men
do
want
them
to
have
a
girl
other
men
want
them
just
to
fight
women
and
be
heroes
but
they
must
have
a
girl
it
horrible
for
her
i
squeezed
her
fingers
tighter
as
if
courage
could
be
transmitted
granting
i
had
any
i
think
i
can
get
you
to
england
i
said
shadows
crawled
onto
the
table
and
stayed
there
i
looked
up
at
the
three
men
who
had
been
at
the
end
of
the
bar
they
were
the
men
i
had
seen
in
the
big
coupe
they
wore
black
sweaters
and
black
trousers
their
faces
were
as
expressionless
as
dopers
two
of
them
stood
above
me
the
other
loomed
over
the
girl
drift
off
man
i
was
told
i
heard
the
other
inform
the
girl
we
wrestle
a
fall
sister
what
shall
it
be
judo
slapsie
or
i
stood
up
there
are
times
when
an
englishman
simply
must
be
but
just
then
the
foxlike
man
came
gliding
in
like
the
star
of
a
ballet
the
reaction
of
the
other
three
startled
me
they
were
acutely
embarrassed
he
smiled
at
them
thinly
you
wo
win
my
favor
by
tricks
like
this
he
said
do
get
the
wrong
idea
zirk
one
of
them
pleaded
i
will
if
it
right
he
said
she
told
me
what
you
tried
to
do
this
afternoon
that
wo
endear
you
to
me
either
drift
they
backed
off
awkwardly
let
get
out
of
here
one
of
them
said
loudly
as
they
turned
i
know
a
place
where
they
fight
naked
with
knives
little
zirk
laughed
musically
and
slipped
into
the
seat
beside
my
companion
she
shrank
from
him
just
a
little
i
pushed
my
feet
back
leaned
forward
who
your
friend
baby
he
asked
not
looking
at
her
she
passed
the
question
to
me
with
a
little
gesture
i
told
him
british
he
observed
she
been
asking
you
about
getting
out
of
the
country
about
passports
he
smiled
pleasantly
she
likes
to
start
running
away
do
you
baby
his
small
hand
began
to
stroke
her
wrist
the
fingers
bent
a
little
the
tendons
ridged
as
if
he
were
about
to
grab
and
twist
look
here
i
said
sharply
i
have
to
be
grateful
to
you
for
ordering
off
those
bullies
but
think
nothing
of
it
he
told
me
they
no
harm
except
when
behind
steering
wheels
a
girl
could
cripple
any
one
of
them
why
even
theda
here
if
she
went
in
for
that
sort
of
thing
he
turned
to
her
shifting
his
hand
from
her
wrist
to
her
hair
he
stroked
it
letting
the
strands
slip
slowly
through
his
fingers
you
know
i
lost
tonight
baby
do
you
he
said
softly
i
stood
up
come
along
i
said
to
her
let
leave
she
just
sat
there
i
could
even
tell
if
she
was
trembling
i
tried
to
read
a
message
in
her
eyes
through
the
mask
i
take
you
away
i
said
to
her
i
can
do
it
i
really
will
he
smiled
at
me
she
like
to
go
with
you
he
said
would
you
baby
will
you
or
wo
you
i
said
to
her
she
still
just
sat
there
he
slowly
knotted
his
fingers
in
her
hair
listen
you
little
vermin
i
snapped
at
him
take
your
hands
off
her
he
came
up
from
the
seat
like
a
snake
i
no
fighter
i
just
know
that
the
more
scared
i
am
the
harder
and
straighter
i
hit
this
time
i
was
lucky
but
as
he
crumpled
back
i
felt
a
slap
and
four
stabs
of
pain
in
my
cheek
i
clapped
my
hand
to
it
i
could
feel
the
four
gashes
made
by
her
dagger
finger
caps
and
the
warm
blood
oozing
out
from
them
she
did
look
at
me
she
was
bending
over
little
zirk
and
cuddling
her
mask
to
his
cheek
and
crooning
there
there
do
feel
bad
you
be
able
to
hurt
me
afterward
there
were
sounds
around
us
but
they
did
come
close
i
leaned
forward
and
ripped
the
mask
from
her
face
i
really
do
know
why
i
should
have
expected
her
face
to
be
anything
else
it
was
very
pale
of
course
and
there
were
any
cosmetics
i
suppose
there
no
point
in
wearing
any
under
a
mask
the
were
untidy
and
the
lips
chapped
but
as
for
the
general
expression
as
for
the
feelings
crawling
and
wriggling
across
it
have
you
ever
lifted
a
rock
from
damp
soil
have
you
ever
watched
the
slimy
white
grubs
i
looked
down
at
her
she
up
at
me
yes
you
so
frightened
you
i
said
sarcastically
you
dread
this
little
nightly
drama
you
you
scared
to
death
and
i
walked
right
out
into
the
purple
night
still
holding
my
hand
to
my
bleeding
cheek
no
one
stopped
me
not
even
the
girl
wrestlers
i
wished
i
could
tear
a
tab
from
under
my
shirt
and
test
it
then
and
there
and
find
i
taken
too
much
radiation
and
so
be
able
to
ask
to
cross
the
hudson
and
go
down
new
jersey
past
the
lingering
radiance
of
the
narrows
bomb
and
so
on
to
sandy
hook
to
wait
for
the
rusty
ship
that
would
take
me
back
over
the
seas
to
england
