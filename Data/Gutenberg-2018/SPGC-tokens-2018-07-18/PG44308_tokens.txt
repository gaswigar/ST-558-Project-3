remarks
introduction
the
art
of
war
has
been
very
simply
defined
as
the
art
which
enables
any
commander
to
worst
the
forces
opposed
to
it
is
therefore
conversant
with
an
enormous
variety
of
subjects
strategy
and
tactics
are
but
two
of
the
more
important
of
its
branches
besides
dealing
with
discipline
organization
and
armament
it
is
bound
to
investigate
every
means
which
can
be
adapted
to
increase
the
physical
or
moral
efficiency
of
an
army
the
author
who
opened
his
work
with
a
dissertation
on
the
age
which
is
preferable
in
a
generalissimo
or
the
average
height
which
the
infantry
soldier
should
attain
was
dealing
with
the
art
of
war
no
less
than
he
who
confined
himself
to
purely
tactical
speculations
the
complicated
nature
of
the
subject
being
taken
into
consideration
it
is
evident
that
a
complete
sketch
of
the
social
and
political
history
of
any
period
would
be
necessary
to
account
fully
for
the
state
of
the
art
of
war
at
the
time
that
art
has
existed
in
a
rudimentary
form
ever
since
the
day
on
which
two
bodies
of
men
first
met
in
anger
to
settle
a
dispute
by
the
arbitrament
of
force
at
some
epochs
however
military
and
social
history
have
been
far
more
closely
bound
up
than
at
others
in
the
present
century
wars
are
but
episodes
in
a
people
s
existence
there
have
however
been
times
when
the
whole
national
organization
was
founded
on
the
supposition
of
a
normal
state
of
strife
in
such
cases
the
history
of
the
race
and
of
its
art
of
war
are
one
and
the
same
to
detail
the
constitution
of
sparta
or
of
ancient
germany
is
to
give
little
more
than
a
list
of
military
institutions
conversely
to
speak
of
the
characteristics
of
their
military
science
involves
the
mention
of
many
of
their
political
institutions
at
no
time
was
this
interpenetration
more
complete
than
in
the
age
which
forms
the
central
part
of
our
period
feudalism
in
its
origin
and
development
had
a
military
as
well
as
a
social
side
and
its
decline
is
by
no
means
unaffected
by
military
considerations
there
is
a
point
of
view
from
which
its
history
could
be
described
as
the
rise
supremacy
and
decline
of
heavy
cavalry
as
the
chief
power
in
to
a
certain
extent
the
tracing
out
of
this
thesis
will
form
the
subject
of
our
researches
it
is
here
that
we
find
the
thread
which
links
the
history
of
the
military
art
in
the
middle
ages
into
a
connected
whole
between
adrianople
the
first
and
marignano
the
last
of
the
triumphs
of
the
mediæval
horseman
lie
the
chapters
in
the
scientific
history
of
war
which
we
are
about
to
investigate
i
the
transition
from
roman
to
mediæval
forms
in
war
from
the
battle
of
adrianople
to
the
accession
of
maurice
between
the
middle
of
the
fourth
and
the
end
of
the
sixth
century
lies
a
period
of
transition
in
military
history
an
epoch
of
transformations
as
strange
and
as
complete
as
those
contemporary
changes
which
turned
into
a
new
channel
the
course
of
political
history
and
civilisation
in
europe
in
war
as
in
all
else
the
institutions
of
the
ancient
world
are
seen
to
pass
away
and
a
new
order
of
things
develops
itself
numerous
and
striking
as
are
the
symptoms
of
that
period
of
transition
none
is
more
characteristic
than
the
gradual
disuse
of
the
honoured
name
of
legion
the
title
intimately
bound
up
with
all
the
ages
of
roman
greatness
surviving
in
a
very
limited
acceptance
in
the
time
of
justinian
it
had
fifty
years
later
become
obsolete
it
represented
a
form
of
military
efficiency
which
had
now
completely
vanished
that
wonderful
combination
of
strength
and
flexibility
so
solid
and
yet
so
agile
and
easy
to
handle
had
ceased
to
correspond
to
the
needs
of
the
time
the
day
of
the
sword
and
pilum
had
given
place
to
that
of
the
lance
and
bow
the
typical
roman
soldier
was
no
longer
the
iron
legionary
who
with
shield
fitted
close
to
his
left
shoulder
and
sunk
low
cut
his
way
through
the
thickest
hedge
of
pikes
and
stood
firm
before
the
wildest
onset
of
celt
or
german
the
organization
of
augustus
and
trajan
was
swept
away
by
constantine
and
the
legions
which
for
three
hundred
years
had
preserved
their
identity
their
proud
titles
of
honour
and
their
de
knew
themselves
no
longer
constantine
when
he
cut
down
the
numbers
of
the
military
unit
to
a
quarter
of
its
former
strength
and
created
many
scores
of
new
corps
was
acting
from
motives
of
political
and
not
military
expediency
the
armament
and
general
character
of
the
troops
survived
their
organization
and
the
infantry
the
robur
peditum
still
remained
the
most
important
and
numerous
part
of
the
army
at
the
same
time
however
a
tendency
to
strengthen
the
cavalry
made
itself
felt
and
the
proportion
of
that
arm
to
the
whole
number
of
the
military
establishment
continued
steadily
to
increase
throughout
the
fourth
century
constantine
himself
by
depriving
the
legion
of
its
complementary
turmae
and
uniting
the
horsemen
into
larger
independent
bodies
bore
witness
to
their
growing
importance
it
would
seem
that
the
empire
having
finally
abandoned
the
offensive
in
war
and
having
resolved
to
confine
itself
to
the
protection
of
its
own
provinces
found
that
there
was
an
increasing
need
for
troops
who
could
transfer
themselves
with
rapidity
from
one
menaced
point
on
the
frontier
to
another
the
germans
could
easily
distance
the
legion
burdened
by
the
care
of
its
military
machines
and
impedimenta
hence
cavalry
in
larger
numbers
was
required
to
intercept
their
raids
but
it
would
appear
that
another
reason
for
the
increase
of
the
horsemen
was
even
more
powerful
the
ascendancy
of
the
roman
infantry
over
its
enemies
was
no
longer
so
marked
as
in
earlier
ages
and
it
therefore
required
to
be
more
strongly
supported
by
cavalry
than
had
been
previously
necessary
the
franks
burgundians
and
allemanni
of
the
days
of
constantine
were
no
longer
the
savages
of
the
first
century
who
without
helm
or
mail
with
weak
shields
of
and
armed
only
with
the
javelin
tried
to
face
the
embattled
front
of
the
cohort
they
had
now
the
buckler
the
pike
and
the
short
stabbing
sword
scramasax
as
well
as
the
long
cutting
sword
spatha
and
the
deadly
francisca
or
which
whether
thrown
or
wielded
would
penetrate
roman
armour
and
split
the
roman
shield
as
weapons
for
hand
to
hand
combat
these
so
far
surpassed
the
old
framea
that
the
imperial
infantry
found
it
no
light
matter
to
defeat
a
german
tribe
at
the
same
time
the
of
the
roman
army
was
no
longer
what
it
had
once
been
the
corps
were
no
longer
homogeneous
and
the
insufficient
supply
of
recruits
was
eked
out
by
enlisting
slaves
and
barbarians
in
the
legions
themselves
and
not
only
among
the
auxiliary
cohorts
though
seldom
wanting
in
courage
the
troops
of
the
fourth
century
had
lost
the
and
cohesion
of
the
old
roman
infantry
and
required
far
more
careful
handling
on
the
part
of
the
general
few
facts
show
this
more
forcibly
than
the
proposal
of
the
tactician
urbicius
to
furnish
the
legionaries
with
a
large
supply
of
portable
beams
and
stakes
to
be
carried
by
attached
to
each
cohort
these
were
to
be
planted
on
the
flanks
and
in
the
front
of
the
legion
when
there
was
a
probability
of
its
being
attacked
by
hostile
cavalry
behind
them
the
romans
were
to
await
the
enemy
s
onset
without
any
attempt
to
assume
the
offensive
this
proposition
marks
a
great
decay
in
the
efficiency
of
the
imperial
the
troops
of
a
previous
generation
would
have
scorned
such
a
device
accustomed
as
they
were
to
drive
back
with
ease
the
assaults
of
the
parthian
and
sarmatian
this
tendency
to
deterioration
on
the
part
of
the
roman
infantry
and
the
consequent
neglect
of
that
arm
by
the
generals
of
the
time
were
brought
to
a
head
by
a
disaster
the
battle
of
adrianople
was
the
most
fearful
defeat
suffered
by
a
roman
army
since
cannæ
a
slaughter
to
which
it
is
aptly
compared
by
the
military
author
ammianus
marcellinus
the
emperor
valens
all
his
chief
officers
and
forty
thousand
men
were
left
upon
the
field
indeed
the
army
of
the
east
was
almost
annihilated
and
was
never
reorganized
upon
the
same
lines
as
had
previously
served
for
it
the
military
importance
of
adrianople
was
unmistakable
it
was
a
victory
of
cavalry
over
infantry
the
imperial
army
had
developed
its
attack
on
the
position
of
the
goths
and
the
two
forces
were
hotly
engaged
when
suddenly
a
great
body
of
horsemen
charged
in
upon
the
roman
flank
it
was
the
main
strength
of
the
gothic
cavalry
which
had
been
foraging
at
a
distance
receiving
news
of
the
fight
it
had
ridden
straight
for
the
battlefield
two
of
valens
squadrons
which
covered
the
flank
of
his
array
threw
themselves
in
the
way
of
the
oncoming
mass
and
were
ridden
down
and
trampled
under
foot
then
the
goths
swept
down
on
the
infantry
of
the
left
wing
rolled
it
up
and
drove
it
in
upon
the
centre
so
tremendous
was
their
impact
that
the
legions
and
cohorts
were
pushed
together
in
helpless
confusion
every
attempt
to
stand
firm
failed
and
in
a
few
minutes
left
centre
and
reserve
were
one
undistinguishable
mass
imperial
guards
light
troops
lancers
foederati
and
infantry
of
the
line
were
wedged
together
in
a
press
that
grew
closer
every
moment
the
roman
cavalry
saw
that
the
day
was
lost
and
rode
off
without
another
effort
then
the
abandoned
infantry
realised
the
horror
of
their
position
equally
unable
to
deploy
or
to
fly
they
had
to
stand
to
be
cut
down
it
was
a
sight
such
as
had
been
seen
once
before
at
cannæ
and
was
to
be
seen
once
after
at
rosbecque
men
could
not
raise
their
arms
to
strike
a
blow
so
closely
were
they
packed
spears
snapped
right
and
left
their
bearers
being
unable
to
lift
them
to
a
vertical
position
many
soldiers
were
stifled
in
the
press
into
this
quivering
mass
the
goths
rode
plying
lance
and
sword
against
the
helpless
enemy
it
was
not
till
of
the
roman
army
had
fallen
that
the
thinning
of
the
ranks
enabled
a
few
thousand
men
to
break
out
and
follow
their
right
wing
and
cavalry
in
a
headlong
flight
such
was
the
battle
of
adrianople
the
first
great
victory
gained
by
that
heavy
cavalry
which
had
now
shown
its
ability
to
supplant
the
heavy
infantry
of
rome
as
the
ruling
power
of
war
during
their
sojourn
in
the
steppes
of
south
russia
the
goths
first
of
all
teutonic
races
had
become
a
nation
of
horsemen
dwelling
in
the
ukraine
they
had
felt
the
influence
of
that
land
ever
the
nurse
of
cavalry
from
the
day
of
the
scythian
to
that
of
the
tartar
and
cossack
they
had
come
to
consider
it
more
honourable
to
fight
on
horse
than
on
foot
and
every
chief
was
followed
by
his
of
mounted
men
driven
against
their
will
into
conflict
with
the
empire
they
found
themselves
face
to
face
with
the
army
that
had
so
long
held
the
world
in
fear
the
shock
came
and
probably
to
his
own
surprise
the
goth
found
that
his
stout
lance
and
good
steed
would
carry
him
through
the
serried
ranks
of
the
legion
he
had
become
the
arbiter
of
war
the
lineal
ancestor
of
all
the
knights
of
the
middle
ages
the
inaugurator
of
that
ascendancy
of
the
horseman
which
was
to
endure
for
a
thousand
years
theodosius
on
whom
devolved
the
task
of
reorganizing
the
troops
of
the
eastern
empire
appears
to
have
appreciated
to
its
fullest
extent
the
military
meaning
of
the
fight
of
adrianople
abandoning
the
old
roman
theory
of
war
he
decided
that
the
cavalry
must
in
future
compose
the
most
important
part
of
the
imperial
army
to
provide
himself
with
a
sufficient
force
of
horsemen
he
was
driven
to
a
measure
destined
to
sever
all
continuity
between
the
military
organization
of
the
fourth
and
that
of
the
fifth
century
he
did
not
like
constantine
raise
new
corps
but
began
to
enlist
wholesale
every
teutonic
chief
whom
he
could
bribe
to
enter
his
service
the
which
followed
these
princes
were
not
incorporated
with
the
national
troops
they
obeyed
their
immediate
commanders
alone
and
were
strangers
to
the
discipline
of
the
roman
army
yet
to
them
was
practically
entrusted
the
fate
of
the
empire
since
they
formed
the
most
efficient
division
of
the
imperial
forces
from
the
time
of
theodosius
the
prince
had
to
rely
for
the
maintenance
of
order
in
the
roman
world
merely
on
the
amount
of
loyalty
which
a
constant
stream
of
titles
and
honours
could
win
from
the
commanders
of
the
only
six
years
after
adrianople
there
were
already
gothic
and
other
german
horsemen
serving
under
their
own
chiefs
in
the
army
of
the
east
the
native
troops
sunk
at
once
to
an
inferior
position
in
the
eyes
of
roman
generals
and
the
justice
of
their
decision
was
verified
a
few
years
later
when
theodosius
german
mercenaries
won
for
him
the
two
battles
which
crushed
the
usurper
magnus
maximus
and
his
son
victor
on
both
those
occasions
the
roman
infantry
of
the
west
those
gallic
legions
who
had
always
been
considered
the
best
footmen
in
the
world
were
finally
ridden
down
by
the
teutonic
cavalry
who
followed
the
standard
of
the
legitimate
emperor
a
picture
of
the
state
of
the
imperial
army
in
the
western
provinces
drawn
precisely
at
this
period
has
been
preserved
for
us
in
the
work
of
vegetius
a
writer
whose
treatise
would
be
of
far
greater
value
had
he
refrained
from
the
attempt
to
identify
the
organization
of
his
own
day
with
that
of
the
first
century
by
the
use
of
the
same
words
for
entirely
different
things
in
drawing
inferences
from
his
statements
it
has
also
to
be
remembered
that
he
frequently
gives
the
ideal
military
forms
of
his
imagination
instead
of
those
which
really
existed
in
his
day
for
example
his
legion
is
made
to
consist
of
men
while
we
know
that
in
the
end
of
the
fourth
century
its
establishment
did
not
exceed
his
work
is
dedicated
to
one
of
the
emperors
who
bore
the
name
of
valentinian
probably
to
the
second
as
in
spite
of
gibbon
s
arguments
in
favour
of
valentinian
iii
the
relations
of
the
various
arms
to
each
other
and
the
character
of
their
organization
point
to
a
date
prior
to
the
commencement
of
the
fifth
century
a
single
fact
mentioned
by
vegetius
gives
us
the
date
at
which
the
continuity
of
the
existence
of
the
old
roman
heavy
infantry
may
be
said
to
terminate
as
might
be
expected
this
epoch
exactly
corresponds
with
that
of
the
similar
change
in
the
east
which
followed
the
battle
of
adrianople
from
the
foundation
of
the
city
to
the
reign
of
the
sainted
gratian
says
the
tactician
the
legionaries
wore
helmet
and
cuirass
but
when
the
practice
of
holding
frequent
reviews
and
ceased
these
arms
began
to
seem
heavy
because
the
soldiers
seldom
put
them
on
they
therefore
begged
from
the
emperor
permission
to
discard
first
their
cuirasses
and
then
even
their
helmets
and
went
to
face
the
barbarians
unprotected
by
defensive
arms
in
spite
of
the
disasters
which
have
since
ensued
the
infantry
have
not
yet
resumed
the
use
of
them
and
now
how
can
the
roman
soldier
expect
victory
when
helmless
and
unarmoured
and
even
without
a
shield
for
the
shield
can
not
be
used
in
conjunction
with
the
bow
he
goes
against
the
enemy
vegetius
often
more
of
a
rhetorician
than
a
soldier
has
evidently
misstated
the
reason
of
this
change
in
infantry
equipment
at
a
time
when
cavalry
were
clothing
themselves
in
more
complete
armour
it
is
not
likely
that
the
infantry
were
discarding
it
from
mere
sloth
and
feebleness
the
real
meaning
of
the
change
was
that
in
despair
of
resisting
horsemen
any
longer
by
the
solidity
of
a
line
of
heavy
infantry
the
romans
had
turned
their
attention
to
the
use
of
missile
weapons
a
method
of
resisting
cavalry
even
more
efficacious
than
that
which
they
abandoned
as
was
to
be
shown
a
thousand
years
later
at
cressy
and
agincourt
that
vegetius
account
is
also
considerably
exaggerated
is
shown
by
his
enumeration
of
the
legionary
order
of
his
own
day
where
the
first
rank
was
composed
of
men
retaining
shield
pilum
and
cuirass
whom
he
pedantically
calls
principes
the
second
rank
was
composed
of
archers
but
wore
the
cuirass
and
carried
a
lance
also
only
the
remaining
half
of
the
legion
had
entirely
discarded
armour
and
given
up
all
weapons
but
the
bow
vegetius
makes
it
evident
that
cavalry
though
its
importance
was
rapidly
increasing
had
not
yet
entirely
supplanted
infantry
to
such
a
large
extent
as
in
the
eastern
empire
though
no
army
can
hope
for
success
without
them
and
though
they
must
always
be
at
hand
to
protect
the
flanks
they
are
not
in
his
estimation
the
most
effective
force
as
an
antiquary
he
feels
attached
to
the
old
roman
organization
and
must
indeed
have
been
somewhat
behind
the
military
experience
of
his
day
it
may
however
be
remembered
that
the
franks
and
allemanni
the
chief
foes
against
whom
the
western
legions
had
to
contend
were
unlike
the
goths
nearly
all
footmen
it
was
not
till
the
time
of
alaric
that
rome
came
thoroughly
to
know
the
gothic
horsemen
whose
efficiency
constantinople
had
already
comprehended
and
had
contrived
for
the
moment
to
subsidize
in
the
days
of
honorius
however
the
goth
became
the
terror
of
italy
as
he
had
previously
been
of
the
balkan
peninsula
his
lance
and
steed
once
more
asserted
their
supremacy
the
generalship
of
stilicho
the
trained
bowmen
and
pikemen
of
the
reorganized
roman
army
the
native
and
foederate
squadrons
whose
array
flanked
the
legions
were
insufficient
to
arrest
the
gothic
charge
for
years
the
conquerors
rode
at
their
will
through
italy
when
they
quitted
it
it
was
by
their
own
choice
for
there
were
no
troops
left
in
the
world
who
could
have
expelled
them
by
force
the
day
of
infantry
had
in
fact
gone
by
in
southern
europe
they
continued
to
exist
not
as
the
core
and
strength
of
the
army
but
for
various
minor
purposes
to
garrison
towns
or
operate
in
mountainous
countries
roman
and
barbarian
alike
threw
their
vigour
into
the
organization
of
their
cavalry
even
the
duty
of
acting
as
light
troops
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
horsemen
the
roman
trooper
added
the
bow
to
his
equipment
and
in
the
fifth
century
the
native
force
of
the
empire
had
come
to
resemble
that
of
its
old
enemy
the
parthian
state
of
the
first
century
being
composed
of
horsemen
armed
with
bow
and
lance
mixed
with
these
fought
squadrons
of
the
foederati
armed
with
the
lance
alone
such
were
the
troops
of
aetius
and
ricimer
the
army
which
faced
the
huns
on
the
plain
of
chalons
the
huns
themselves
were
another
manifestation
of
the
strength
of
cavalry
formidable
by
their
numbers
their
rapidity
of
movement
and
the
constant
rain
of
arrows
which
they
would
pour
in
without
allowing
their
enemy
to
close
in
their
tactics
they
were
the
prototypes
of
the
hordes
of
alp
arslan
of
genghiz
and
tamerlane
but
mixed
with
the
huns
in
the
train
of
attila
marched
many
subject
german
tribes
herules
and
gepidæ
scyri
lombards
and
rugians
akin
to
the
goths
alike
in
their
race
and
their
manner
of
fighting
chalons
then
was
fought
by
and
lancer
against
and
lancer
a
fair
conflict
with
equal
weapons
the
frankish
allies
of
aetius
were
by
far
the
most
important
body
of
infantry
on
the
field
and
these
were
ranged
according
to
the
traditional
tactics
of
rome
in
the
centre
flanked
on
one
side
by
the
visigothic
lances
on
the
other
by
the
imperial
array
of
and
heavy
cavalry
intermixed
the
victory
was
won
not
by
superior
tactics
but
by
sheer
hard
fighting
the
decisive
point
having
been
the
riding
down
of
the
native
huns
by
theodoric
s
heavier
horsemen
to
trace
out
in
detail
the
military
meaning
of
all
the
wars
of
the
fifth
century
does
not
fall
within
our
province
as
to
the
organization
of
the
roman
armies
a
few
words
will
suffice
in
the
west
the
foederati
became
the
sole
force
of
the
empire
so
that
at
last
one
of
their
chiefs
breaking
through
the
old
spell
of
the
roman
name
could
make
himself
in
title
as
well
as
in
reality
ruler
of
italy
in
the
east
the
decline
of
the
native
troops
never
reached
this
pitch
leo
i
taking
warning
by
the
fate
of
the
western
empire
determined
on
increasing
the
proportion
of
romans
to
foederati
and
carried
out
his
purpose
though
it
involved
the
sacrifice
of
the
life
of
his
benefactor
the
gothic
patrician
aspar
zeno
continued
this
work
and
made
himself
noteworthy
as
the
first
emperor
who
utilised
the
military
virtues
of
the
isaurians
or
mountaineers
of
the
interior
of
asia
minor
not
only
did
they
form
his
imperial
guard
but
a
considerable
number
of
new
corps
were
raised
among
them
zeno
also
enlisted
armenians
and
other
inhabitants
of
the
roman
frontier
of
the
east
and
handed
over
to
his
successor
anastasius
an
army
in
which
the
barbarian
element
was
adequately
counterpoised
by
the
native
troops
the
victorious
armies
of
justinian
were
therefore
composed
of
two
distinct
elements
the
foreign
auxiliaries
serving
under
their
own
chiefs
and
the
regular
imperial
troops
the
pages
of
procopius
give
us
sufficient
evidence
that
in
both
these
divisions
the
cavalry
was
by
far
the
most
important
arm
the
light
horseman
of
the
asiatic
provinces
wins
his
especial
praise
with
body
and
limbs
clothed
in
mail
his
quiver
at
his
right
side
and
his
sword
at
his
left
the
roman
trooper
would
gallop
along
and
discharge
his
arrows
to
front
or
flank
or
rear
with
equal
ease
to
support
him
marched
in
the
second
line
the
heavier
squadrons
of
the
subsidized
lombard
or
herule
or
gepidan
princes
armed
with
the
lance
there
are
some
writes
procopius
who
regard
antiquity
with
wonder
and
respect
and
attach
no
special
worth
to
our
modern
military
institutions
it
is
however
by
means
of
the
latter
that
the
weightiest
and
most
striking
results
have
been
the
men
of
the
sixth
century
were
in
fact
entirely
satisfied
with
the
system
of
cavalry
tactics
which
they
had
adopted
and
looked
with
a
certain
air
of
superiority
on
the
infantry
tactics
of
their
roman
predecessors
justinian
s
army
and
its
achievements
were
indeed
worthy
of
all
praise
its
victories
were
its
own
while
its
defeats
were
generally
due
to
the
wretched
policy
of
the
emperor
who
persisted
in
dividing
up
the
command
among
many
hands
a
system
which
secured
military
obedience
at
the
expense
of
military
efficiency
justinian
might
however
plead
in
his
defence
that
the
organization
of
the
army
had
become
such
that
it
constituted
a
standing
menace
to
the
central
power
the
system
of
the
teutonic
comitatus
of
the
surrounding
a
leader
to
whom
the
soldiers
are
bound
by
a
personal
tie
had
become
deeply
ingrained
in
the
imperial
forces
always
predominant
among
the
foederati
it
had
spread
from
them
to
the
native
corps
in
the
sixth
century
the
monarch
had
always
to
dread
that
the
loyalty
of
the
troops
towards
their
immediate
commanders
might
prevail
over
their
higher
duties
belisarius
and
even
narses
were
surrounded
by
large
bodyguards
of
chosen
men
bound
to
them
by
oath
that
of
the
former
general
at
the
time
of
his
gothic
triumph
amounted
to
veteran
horsemen
the
existence
of
such
corps
rendered
every
successful
commander
a
possible
wallenstein
to
use
a
name
of
more
modern
importance
thus
the
emperor
in
his
desire
to
avert
the
predominance
of
any
single
officer
would
join
several
men
of
discordant
views
in
the
command
of
an
army
and
usually
ensure
the
most
disastrous
consequences
this
organization
of
the
imperial
force
in
banda
bodies
attached
by
personal
ties
to
their
leaders
is
the
characteristic
military
form
of
the
sixth
century
its
normal
prevalence
is
shown
by
the
contemporary
custom
of
speaking
of
each
corps
by
the
name
of
its
commanding
officer
and
not
by
any
official
title
nothing
could
be
more
opposed
than
this
usage
to
old
roman
precedent
the
efficiency
of
justinian
s
army
in
the
vandalic
persian
or
gothic
wars
depended
as
has
already
been
implied
almost
entirely
on
its
excellent
cavalry
the
troops
whether
teutonic
or
eastern
against
which
it
was
employed
were
also
horsemen
engaging
them
the
romans
prevailed
because
in
each
case
they
were
able
to
meet
their
adversaries
weapons
and
tactics
not
merely
with
similar
methods
but
with
a
greater
variety
of
resources
against
the
persian
was
sent
not
only
the
equipped
with
arms
of
the
same
description
but
the
heavy
foederate
lancers
who
could
ride
the
oriental
down
against
the
gothic
heavy
cavalry
the
same
lancers
were
supported
by
the
mounted
bowmen
to
whom
the
goths
had
nothing
to
oppose
if
however
the
roman
army
enjoyed
all
the
advantages
of
its
diverse
composition
it
was
on
the
other
hand
liable
to
all
the
perils
which
arise
from
a
want
of
homogeneity
its
various
elements
were
kept
together
only
by
military
pride
or
confidence
in
some
successful
general
hence
in
the
troublous
times
which
commenced
in
the
end
of
justinian
s
reign
and
continued
through
those
of
his
successors
the
whole
military
organization
of
the
empire
began
to
crumble
away
a
change
not
less
sweeping
than
that
which
theodosius
had
introduced
was
again
to
be
taken
in
hand
in
the
reforming
emperor
maurice
came
to
the
throne
and
commenced
to
recast
the
imperial
army
in
a
new
mould
ii
the
early
middle
ages
from
the
fall
of
the
western
empire
to
the
battles
of
hastings
and
durazzo
franks
scandinavians
in
leaving
the
discussion
of
the
military
art
of
the
later
romans
in
order
to
investigate
that
of
the
nations
of
northern
and
western
europe
we
are
stepping
from
a
region
of
comparative
light
into
one
of
doubt
and
obscurity
the
data
which
in
the
history
of
the
empire
may
occasionally
seem
scanty
and
insufficient
are
in
the
history
of
the
teutonic
races
often
entirely
wanting
to
draw
up
from
our
fragmentary
authorities
an
estimate
of
the
military
importance
of
the
eastern
campaigns
of
heraclius
is
not
easy
but
to
discover
what
were
the
particular
military
causes
which
settled
the
event
of
the
day
at
vouglé
or
tolbiac
at
badbury
or
the
heavenfield
is
absolutely
impossible
the
state
of
the
art
of
war
in
the
dark
ages
has
to
be
worked
out
from
monkish
chronicles
and
national
songs
from
the
casual
references
of
byzantine
historians
from
the
quaint
drawings
of
the
illuminated
manuscript
or
the
mouldering
fragments
found
in
the
warrior
s
barrow
it
is
fortunate
that
the
general
characteristics
of
the
period
render
its
military
history
comparatively
simple
of
strategy
there
could
be
little
in
an
age
when
men
strove
to
win
their
ends
by
hard
fighting
rather
than
by
skilful
operations
or
the
utilizing
of
extraneous
advantages
tactics
were
stereotyped
by
the
national
organizations
of
the
various
peoples
the
true
interest
of
the
centuries
of
the
early
middle
ages
lies
in
the
gradual
evolution
of
new
forms
of
warlike
efficiency
which
end
in
the
establishment
of
a
military
class
as
the
chief
factor
in
war
and
the
decay
among
most
peoples
of
the
old
system
which
made
the
tribe
arrayed
in
arms
the
normal
fighting
force
intimately
connected
with
this
change
was
an
alteration
in
arms
and
equipment
which
transformed
the
outward
appearance
of
war
in
a
manner
not
less
complete
this
period
of
transition
may
be
considered
to
end
when
in
the
eleventh
century
the
feudal
cavalier
established
his
superiority
over
all
the
descriptions
of
troops
which
were
pitted
against
him
from
the
magyar
of
the
east
to
the
of
the
west
the
fight
of
hastings
the
last
attempt
made
for
three
centuries
by
infantry
to
withstand
cavalry
serves
to
mark
the
termination
of
the
epoch
the
teutonic
nation
of
europe
did
not
like
the
goths
and
lombards
owe
their
victories
to
the
strength
of
their
cavalry
the
franks
and
saxons
of
the
sixth
and
seventh
centuries
were
still
infantry
it
would
appear
that
the
moors
of
north
germany
and
schleswig
and
the
heaths
and
marshes
of
belgium
were
less
favourable
to
the
growth
of
cavalry
than
the
steppes
of
the
ukraine
or
the
plains
of
the
danube
valley
the
frank
as
pictured
to
us
by
sidonius
apollinaris
procopius
and
agathias
still
bore
a
considerable
resemblance
to
his
sigambrian
ancestors
like
them
he
was
destitute
of
helmet
and
his
shield
however
had
become
a
much
more
effective
defence
than
the
wicker
framework
of
the
first
century
it
was
a
solid
oval
with
a
large
iron
boss
and
rim
the
framea
had
now
been
superseded
by
the
angon
a
dart
neither
very
long
nor
very
short
which
can
be
used
against
the
enemy
either
by
grasping
it
as
a
pike
or
hurling
it
the
iron
of
its
head
extended
far
down
the
shaft
at
its
neck
were
two
barbs
which
made
its
extraction
from
a
wound
or
a
pierced
shield
almost
impossible
the
francisca
however
was
the
great
weapon
of
the
people
from
whom
it
derived
its
name
it
was
a
with
a
heavy
head
composed
of
a
long
blade
curved
on
its
outer
face
and
deeply
hollowed
in
the
interior
it
was
carefully
weighted
so
that
it
could
be
used
like
an
american
tomahawk
for
hurling
at
the
enemy
the
skill
with
which
the
franks
discharged
this
weapon
just
before
closing
with
the
hostile
line
was
extraordinary
and
its
effectiveness
made
it
their
favourite
arm
a
sword
and
dagger
scramasax
completed
the
normal
equipment
of
the
warrior
the
last
was
a
broad
thrusting
blade
inches
long
the
former
a
cutting
weapon
of
about
feet
in
length
such
was
the
equipment
of
the
armies
which
theodebert
buccelin
and
lothair
led
down
into
italy
in
the
middle
of
the
sixth
century
procopius
informs
us
that
the
prince
brought
with
him
some
cavalry
their
numbers
however
were
insignificant
a
few
hundreds
in
an
army
of
men
they
carried
the
lance
and
a
small
round
buckler
and
served
as
a
round
the
person
of
the
king
their
presence
though
pointing
to
a
new
military
departure
among
the
franks
only
serves
to
show
the
continued
predominance
of
infantry
in
their
armies
a
problem
interesting
to
the
historian
was
worked
out
when
in
the
footmen
of
buccelin
met
the
roman
army
of
narses
at
the
battle
of
casilinum
the
superiority
of
the
tactics
and
armament
of
the
imperial
troops
was
made
equally
conspicuous
formed
in
one
deep
column
the
franks
advanced
into
the
centre
of
the
semicircle
in
which
narses
had
ranged
his
men
the
roman
infantry
and
the
dismounted
heavy
cavalry
of
the
herule
auxiliaries
held
them
in
play
in
front
while
the
closed
in
on
their
flanks
and
inflicted
on
them
the
same
fate
which
had
befallen
the
army
of
crassus
hardly
a
man
of
buccelin
s
followers
escaped
from
the
field
the
day
of
infantry
was
gone
for
the
franks
as
much
as
for
the
rest
of
the
world
we
are
accordingly
not
surprised
to
find
that
from
the
sixth
to
the
ninth
century
a
steady
increase
in
the
proportion
of
cavalry
in
the
frank
armies
is
to
be
found
corresponding
to
it
is
an
increased
employment
of
defensive
arms
a
crested
helmet
of
classical
shape
becomes
common
among
them
and
shortly
after
a
reaching
to
the
hips
is
introduced
the
emperor
charles
the
great
himself
contributed
to
the
armament
of
his
cavalry
by
adopting
defences
for
the
arms
and
thighs
coxarum
exteriora
in
eo
ferreis
ambiebantur
bracteolis
this
protection
however
was
at
first
rejected
by
many
of
the
franks
who
complained
that
it
impaired
their
seat
on
horseback
at
tours
a
considerable
number
of
horsemen
appear
to
have
served
in
the
army
of
charles
martel
the
general
tactics
of
the
day
however
were
not
those
of
an
army
mainly
composed
of
cavalry
the
franks
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
and
fought
a
waiting
battle
till
the
of
the
saracens
had
exhausted
their
strength
in
countless
unsuccessful
charges
then
they
pushed
forward
and
routed
such
of
the
enemy
as
had
spirit
to
continue
the
fight
in
the
time
of
charles
the
great
we
are
told
that
all
men
of
importance
with
their
immediate
followers
were
accustomed
to
serve
on
horseback
the
national
forces
however
as
opposed
to
the
personal
retinues
of
the
monarch
and
his
great
officials
and
nobles
continued
to
form
the
infantry
of
the
army
as
can
be
seen
from
the
list
of
the
weapons
which
the
counts
are
directed
to
provide
for
them
the
capitularies
are
explicit
in
declaring
that
the
local
commanders
are
to
be
careful
that
the
men
whom
they
have
to
lead
to
battle
are
fully
equipped
that
is
that
they
possess
spear
shield
helm
brunia
a
bow
two
and
twelve
arrows
the
franks
had
therefore
become
heavy
infantry
at
the
end
of
the
eighth
century
in
the
ninth
century
they
were
finally
to
abandon
their
old
tactics
and
to
entrust
all
important
operations
to
their
cavalry
this
transformation
may
be
said
to
date
from
the
law
of
charles
the
bald
providing
ut
pagenses
franci
qui
caballos
habent
aut
habere
possunt
cum
suis
comitibus
in
hostem
whether
merely
ratifying
an
existing
state
of
things
or
instituting
a
new
one
this
order
is
eminently
characteristic
of
the
period
in
which
the
defence
of
the
country
was
falling
into
the
hands
of
its
cavalry
force
alone
of
the
causes
which
led
to
this
consummation
the
most
important
was
the
character
of
the
enemies
with
whom
the
franks
had
to
contend
in
the
ninth
and
tenth
centuries
the
northman
in
the
western
kingdom
the
magyar
in
the
eastern
were
marauders
bent
on
plunder
alone
and
owing
their
success
to
the
rapidity
of
their
movements
the
hosts
of
the
vikings
were
in
the
habit
of
seizing
horses
in
the
country
which
they
invaded
and
then
rode
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
land
always
distancing
the
local
levies
the
hungarian
conducted
forays
into
the
heart
of
germany
yet
succeeded
in
evading
pursuit
for
the
repression
of
such
inroads
infantry
was
absolutely
useless
like
the
romans
of
the
fourth
century
the
franks
when
obliged
to
stand
upon
the
defensive
had
to
rely
upon
their
cavalry
this
crisis
in
the
military
history
of
europe
coincided
with
the
breaking
up
of
all
central
power
in
the
shipwreck
of
the
dynasty
of
charles
the
great
in
the
absence
of
any
organized
national
resistance
the
defence
of
the
empire
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
local
counts
who
now
became
sovereigns
to
these
petty
rulers
the
landholders
of
each
district
were
now
commending
themselves
in
order
to
obtain
protection
in
an
age
of
war
and
anarchy
at
the
same
time
and
for
the
same
reason
the
poorer
freemen
were
commending
themselves
to
the
landholders
thus
the
feudal
hierarchy
was
established
and
a
new
military
system
appears
when
the
count
or
duke
leads
out
to
battle
his
vassals
and
their
mounted
retainers
politically
retrogressive
as
was
that
system
it
had
yet
its
day
of
success
the
magyar
was
crushed
at
merseberg
and
the
lechfeld
and
driven
back
across
the
leith
soon
to
become
christianised
and
grow
into
an
orderly
member
of
the
european
commonwealth
the
viking
was
checked
in
his
plundering
forays
expelled
from
his
strongholds
at
the
and
restricted
to
the
single
possession
of
normandy
where
he
like
the
magyar
was
assimilated
to
the
rest
of
feudal
society
the
force
which
had
won
these
victories
and
saved
europe
from
a
relapse
into
the
savagery
and
paganism
of
the
north
and
east
was
that
of
the
horseman
what
wonder
then
if
his
contemporaries
and
successors
glorified
him
into
the
normal
type
of
warriorhood
and
believed
that
no
other
form
of
military
efficiency
was
worth
cultivating
the
perpetuation
of
feudal
chivalry
for
four
hundred
years
was
the
reward
of
its
triumphs
in
the
end
of
the
dark
ages
beyond
the
english
channel
the
course
of
the
history
of
war
is
parallel
to
that
which
it
took
in
the
lands
of
the
continent
with
a
single
exception
in
the
form
of
its
final
development
like
the
franks
the
angles
and
saxons
were
at
the
time
of
their
conquest
of
britain
a
nation
of
infantry
soldiers
armed
with
the
long
ashen
javelin
the
broadsword
the
seax
or
broad
stabbing
dagger
and
occasionally
the
their
defensive
weapon
was
almost
exclusively
the
shield
the
round
with
its
large
iron
boss
though
known
to
them
at
a
very
early
date
was
as
all
indications
unite
to
show
extremely
uncommon
the
grey
or
byrnie
of
beowulf
was
obtainable
by
kings
and
princes
alone
the
helmet
also
with
its
was
very
restricted
in
its
use
if
the
monarch
and
his
gesiths
wore
such
arms
the
national
levy
which
formed
the
main
fighting
force
of
a
heptarchic
kingdom
was
entirely
without
them
unmolested
for
many
centuries
in
their
island
home
the
english
kept
up
the
old
teutonic
war
customs
for
a
longer
period
than
other
european
nations
when
mercia
and
wessex
were
at
strife
the
campaign
was
fought
out
by
the
hosts
of
the
various
districts
headed
by
their
aldermen
and
reeves
hence
war
bore
the
spasmodic
and
inconsequent
character
which
resulted
from
the
temporary
nature
of
such
armies
with
so
weak
a
military
organization
there
was
no
possibility
of
working
out
schemes
of
steady
and
progressive
conquest
the
frays
of
the
various
kingdoms
bitter
and
unceasing
though
they
might
be
led
to
no
decisive
results
if
in
the
ninth
century
a
tendency
towards
unification
began
to
show
itself
in
england
it
was
caused
not
by
the
military
superiority
of
wessex
but
by
the
dying
out
of
royal
lines
and
the
unfortunate
internal
condition
of
the
other
states
while
this
inclination
towards
union
was
developing
itself
the
whole
island
was
subjected
to
the
stress
of
the
same
storm
of
foreign
invasion
which
was
shaking
the
frankish
empire
to
its
foundations
the
danes
came
down
upon
england
and
demonstrated
by
the
fearful
success
of
their
raids
that
the
old
teutonic
military
system
was
inadequate
to
the
needs
of
the
day
the
vikings
were
in
fact
superior
to
the
forces
brought
against
them
alike
in
tactics
in
armament
in
training
and
in
mobility
personally
the
dane
was
the
member
of
an
old
contending
with
a
farmer
fresh
from
the
plough
a
veteran
soldier
pitted
against
a
raw
militiaman
as
a
professional
warrior
he
had
provided
himself
with
an
equipment
which
only
the
chiefs
among
the
english
army
could
rival
the
mail
byrnie
being
a
normal
rather
than
an
exceptional
defence
and
the
steel
cap
almost
universal
the
fyrd
on
the
other
hand
came
out
against
him
destitute
of
armour
and
bearing
a
motley
array
of
weapons
wherein
the
spear
and
sword
were
mixed
with
the
club
and
the
if
however
the
danes
had
been
in
the
habit
of
waiting
for
the
local
levies
to
come
up
with
them
equal
courage
and
superior
numbers
might
have
prevailed
over
these
advantages
of
equipment
plunder
however
rather
than
fighting
was
the
vikings
object
the
host
threw
itself
upon
some
district
of
the
english
coast
was
there
and
then
rode
far
and
wide
through
the
land
doing
all
the
damage
in
its
power
the
possession
of
the
horses
they
had
seized
gave
them
a
power
of
rapid
movement
which
the
fyrd
could
not
hope
to
equal
when
the
local
levies
arrived
at
the
spot
where
the
invaders
had
been
last
seen
it
was
only
to
find
smoke
and
ruins
not
an
enemy
when
driven
to
bay
as
in
spite
of
their
habitual
retreats
was
sometimes
the
case
the
danes
showed
an
instinctive
tactical
ability
by
their
use
of
entrenchments
with
which
the
english
were
unaccustomed
to
deal
behind
a
ditch
and
palisade
in
some
commanding
spot
the
invaders
would
wait
for
months
till
the
accumulated
force
of
the
fyrd
had
melted
away
to
its
homes
of
assaults
on
their
positions
they
knew
no
fear
the
line
of
axemen
could
generally
contrive
to
keep
down
the
most
impetuous
charge
of
the
english
levies
reading
was
a
more
typical
field
than
ethandun
for
one
successful
storm
of
an
intrenched
camp
there
were
two
bloody
repulses
thirty
years
of
disasters
sealed
the
fate
of
the
old
national
military
organization
something
more
than
the
fyrd
was
necessary
to
meet
the
organized
of
the
danes
the
social
results
of
the
invasion
in
england
had
been
similar
to
those
which
we
have
observed
in
the
frankish
empire
everywhere
the
free
ceorls
had
been
commending
themselves
to
the
neighbouring
landowners
by
accepting
this
commendation
the
thegnhood
had
rendered
itself
responsible
for
the
defence
of
the
country
the
kingly
power
was
in
stronger
hands
in
england
than
across
the
channel
so
that
the
new
system
did
not
at
once
develope
itself
into
feudalism
able
to
utilise
instead
of
bound
to
fear
the
results
of
the
change
alfred
and
eadward
determined
to
use
it
as
the
basis
for
a
new
military
organization
accordingly
all
holders
of
five
hides
of
land
were
subjected
to
and
formed
a
permanent
basis
for
the
national
army
to
supplement
the
force
thus
obtained
the
fyrd
was
divided
into
two
halves
one
of
which
was
always
to
be
available
these
arrangements
had
the
happiest
results
the
tide
of
war
turned
and
england
reasserted
itself
till
the
tenth
century
saw
the
culmination
of
her
new
strength
at
the
great
battle
of
brunanburh
the
thegn
a
soldier
by
position
like
the
frankish
noble
has
now
become
the
leading
figure
in
war
arrayed
in
mail
shirt
and
steel
cap
and
armed
with
sword
and
long
pointed
shield
the
bands
of
chosen
ones
were
ready
to
face
and
hew
down
the
danish
axemen
it
is
however
worth
remembering
that
the
military
problem
of
the
day
had
now
been
much
simplified
for
the
english
by
the
settlement
of
the
invaders
within
the
danelaw
an
enemy
who
has
towns
to
be
burnt
and
homesteads
to
be
harried
can
have
pressure
put
upon
him
which
can
not
be
brought
to
bear
on
a
marauder
whose
basis
of
operations
is
the
sea
it
is
noteworthy
that
eadward
utilised
against
the
danes
that
same
system
of
fortified
positions
which
they
had
employed
against
his
predecessors
the
stockades
of
his
new
burghs
served
to
hold
in
check
the
heres
of
the
local
jarls
of
the
five
towns
while
the
king
with
his
main
force
was
busied
in
other
quarters
a
century
later
than
the
military
reforms
of
alfred
the
feudal
danger
which
had
split
up
the
frankish
realm
began
to
make
itself
felt
in
england
the
great
ealdormen
of
the
reign
of
ethelred
correspond
to
the
counts
of
the
time
of
charles
the
fat
in
their
tendency
to
pass
from
the
position
of
officials
into
that
of
petty
princes
their
rise
is
marked
by
the
decay
of
the
central
military
organization
for
war
and
during
the
new
series
of
danish
invasions
the
forces
of
each
ealdormanry
are
seen
to
fight
and
fall
without
any
support
from
their
neighbours
england
was
in
all
probability
only
saved
from
the
fate
of
france
by
the
accession
of
canute
that
monarch
besides
reducing
the
provincial
governors
to
their
old
position
of
delegates
of
the
crown
strengthened
his
position
by
the
institution
of
the
a
force
sufficiently
numerous
to
be
called
a
small
standing
army
rather
than
a
mere
royal
guard
these
troops
are
not
only
the
most
characteristic
token
of
the
existence
of
a
powerful
central
government
but
represent
the
maximum
of
military
efficiency
to
be
found
in
the
world
their
tactics
and
weapons
differed
entirely
from
those
of
the
feudal
aristocracy
of
the
continent
against
whom
they
were
ere
long
to
be
pitted
they
bore
the
long
danish
a
shaft
five
feet
long
fitted
with
a
head
of
enormous
size
it
was
far
too
ponderous
for
use
on
horseback
and
being
wielded
with
both
arms
precluded
the
use
of
a
shield
in
hand
to
hand
combat
the
blows
delivered
by
this
weapon
were
tremendous
no
shield
or
mail
could
resist
them
they
were
even
capable
as
was
shown
at
hastings
of
lopping
off
a
horse
s
head
at
a
single
stroke
the
in
his
defensive
equipment
did
not
differ
from
the
cavalry
of
the
lands
beyond
the
channel
like
them
he
wore
a
mail
shirt
of
a
considerable
length
reaching
down
to
the
lower
thigh

cap
fitted
with
a
nasal
the
tactics
of
the
english
axemen
were
those
of
the
column
arranged
in
a
compact
mass
they
could
beat
off
almost
any
attack
and
hew
their
way
through
every
obstacle
their
personal
strength
and
steadiness
their
confidence
and
de
made
them
the
most
dangerous
adversaries
their
array
however
was
vitiated
by
the
two
defects
of
slowness
of
movement
and
vulnerability
by
missiles
if
assailed
by
horsemen
they
were
obliged
to
halt
and
remain
fixed
to
the
spot
in
order
to
keep
off
the
enemy
by
their
close
order
if
attacked
from
a
distance
by
light
troops
they
were
also
at
a
disadvantage
as
unable
to
reach
men
who
retired
before
them
the
battle
of
hastings
the
first
great
mediæval
fight
of
which
we
have
an
account
clear
enough
to
give
us
an
insight
into
the
causes
of
its
result
was
the
final
trial
of
this
form
of
military
efficiency
backed
by
the
disorderly
masses
of
the
fyrd
and
by
the
thegns
of
the
home
counties
the
of
king
harold
stood
in
arms
to
defend
the
entrenchments
of
senlac
formidable
as
was
the
english
array
it
was
opposed
precisely
by
those
arms
which
in
the
hands
of
an
able
general
were
competent
to
master
it
the
norman
knights
if
unsupported
by
their
light
infantry
might
have
surged
for
ever
around
the
impregnable
palisades
the
archers
if
unsupported
by
the
knights
could
easily
have
been
driven
off
the
field
by
a
general
charge
united
however
by
the
skilful
tactics
of
william
the
two
divisions
of
the
invading
army
won
the
day
the
saxon
mass
was
subjected
to
exactly
the
same
trial
which
befell
the
british
squares
in
the
battle
of
waterloo
incessant
charges
by
a
gallant
cavalry
were
alternated
with
a
destructive
fire
of
missiles
nothing
can
be
more
maddening
than
such
an
ordeal
to
the
infantry
soldier
rooted
to
the
spot
by
the
necessities
of
his
formation
after
repelling
charge
after
charge
with
the
greatest
steadiness
the
axemen
could
no
longer
bear
the
rain
of
arrows
when
at
last
the
horsemen
drew
back
in
apparent
disorder
a
great
part
of
harold
s
troops
stormed
down
into
the
valley
after
them
determined
to
finish
the
battle
by
an
advance
which
should
not
allow
the
enemy
time
to
rally
this
mistake
was
fatal
the
norman
retreat
had
been
the
result
of
the
duke
s
orders
not
of
a
wish
to
leave
the
field
the
cavalry
turned
rode
down
the
scattered
mass
which
had
pursued
them
and
broke
into
the
gap
in
the
english
line
which
had
been
made
by
the
inconsiderate
charge
desperate
as
was
their
position
the
english
still
held
out
the
arrows
fell
thickly
among
them
the
knights
were
forcing
their
way
among
the
disordered
ranks
of
the
broken
army
but
for
three
hours
longer
the
fight
went
on
this
exhibition
of
courage
only
served
to
increase
the
number
of
the
slain
the
day
was
hopelessly
lost
and
as
evening
fell
the
few
survivors
of
the
english
army
were
glad
to
be
able
to
make
their
retreat
under
cover
of
the
darkness
the
tactics
of
the
phalanx
of
axemen
had
been
decisively
beaten
by
william
s
combination
of
archers
and
cavalry
once
more
only
on
a
field
far
away
from
its
native
land
did
the
weapon
of
the
dispute
the
victory
with
the
lance
and
bow
fifteen
years
after
harold
s
defeat
another
body
of
english
axemen
some
of
them
may
well
have
fought
at
senlac
were
advancing
against
the
army
of
a
norman
prince
they
were
the
varangian
guard
the
famous
πελεκυφóροι
pelekuphóroi
of
the
emperor
alexius
comnenus
that
prince
was
engaged
in
an
attempt
to
raise
the
siege
of
dyrrhachium
then
invested
by
robert
guiscard
the
norman
army
was
already
drawn
up
in
front
of
its
lines
while
the
troops
of
alexius
were
only
slowly
arriving
on
the
field
among
the
foremost
of
his
corps
were
the
varangians
whom
his
care
had
provided
with
horses
in
order
that
they
might
get
to
the
front
quickly
and
execute
a
turning
movement
this
they
accomplished
but
when
they
approached
the
enemy
they
were
carried
away
by
their
eagerness
to
begin
the
fray
without
waiting
for
the
main
attack
of
the
greek
army
to
be
developed
the
axemen
sent
their
horses
to
the
rear
and
advanced
in
a
solid
column
against
the
norman
flank
rushing
upon
the
division
commanded
by
count
amaury
of
bari
they
drove
it
horse
and
foot
into
the
sea
their
success
however
had
disordered
their
ranks
and
the
norman
prince
was
enabled
since
alexius
main
body
was
still
far
distant
to
turn
all
his
forces
against
them
a
vigorous
cavalry
charge
cut
off
the
greater
part
of
the
english
the
remainder
collected
on
a
little
mound
by
the
surmounted
by
a
deserted
chapel
here
they
were
surrounded
by
the
normans
and
a
scene
much
like
senlac
but
on
a
smaller
scale
was
enacted
after
the
horsemen
and
the
archers
had
destroyed
the
majority
of
the
varangians
the
remainder
held
out
obstinately
within
the
chapel
sending
for
fascines
and
timber
from
his
camp
robert
heaped
them
round
the
building
and
set
fire
to
the
mass
the
english
sallied
out
to
be
slain
one
by
one
or
perished
in
the
flames
not
a
man
escaped
the
whole
corps
suffered
destruction
as
a
consequence
of
their
misplaced
eagerness
to
open
the
fight
such
was
the
fate
of
the
last
attempt
made
by
infantry
to
face
the
feudal
array
of
the
eleventh
century
no
similar
experiment
was
now
to
be
made
for
more
than
two
hundred
years
the
supremacy
of
cavalry
was
finally
established
iii
the
byzantines
and
their
enemies
from
the
accession
of
maurice
to
the
battle
of
manzikert
of
byzantine
alike
in
composition
and
in
organization
the
army
which
for
years
held
back
slav
and
saracen
from
the
frontier
of
the
eastern
empire
differed
from
the
troops
whose
name
and
traditions
it
inherited
to
the
palatine
and
limitary
numeri
of
constantine
it
bore
as
little
likeness
as
to
the
legions
of
trajan
yet
in
one
respect
at
least
it
resembled
both
those
forces
it
was
in
its
day
the
most
efficient
military
body
in
the
world
the
men
of
the
lower
empire
have
received
scant
justice
at
the
hands
of
modern
historians
their
manifest
faults
have
thrown
the
stronger
points
of
their
character
into
the
shade
and
byzantinism
is
accepted
as
a
synonym
for
effete
incapacity
alike
in
peace
and
war
much
might
be
written
in
general
vindication
of
their
age
but
never
is
it
easier
to
produce
a
strong
defence
than
when
their
military
skill
and
prowess
are
disparaged
the
vices
of
byzantine
armies
says
gibbon
were
inherent
their
victories
so
far
is
this
sweeping
condemnation
from
the
truth
that
it
would
be
far
more
correct
to
call
their
defeats
accidental
their
successes
normal
bad
generalship
insufficient
numbers
unforeseen
calamities
not
the
inefficiency
of
the
troops
were
the
usual
causes
of
disaster
in
the
campaigns
of
the
eastern
emperors
to
the
excellence
of
the
soldiery
witness
direct
or
indirect
is
borne
in
every
one
of
those
military
treatises
which
give
us
such
a
vivid
picture
of
the
warfare
of
the
age
unless
the
general
is
incompetent
or
the
surrounding
circumstances
unusually
adverse
the
authors
always
assume
that
victory
will
follow
the
banner
of
the
empire
the
troops
can
be
trusted
like
wellington
s
peninsular
veterans
to
go
anywhere
and
do
the
commander
says
nicephorus
phocas
who
has
of
our
heavy
cavalry
and
god
s
help
needs
nothing
in
a
similar
spirit
leo
the
philosopher
declares
in
his
tactica
that
except
the
frankish
and
lombard
knights
there
were
no
horsemen
in
the
world
who
could
face
the
byzantine
cataphracti
when
the
numbers
of
the
combatants
approached
equality
slav
turk
or
saracen
could
be
ridden
down
by
a
charge
fairly
pressed
home
only
with
the
men
of
the
west
was
the
result
of
the
shock
doubtful
the
causes
of
the
excellence
and
efficiency
of
the
byzantine
army
are
not
hard
to
discover
in
courage
they
were
equal
to
their
enemies
in
discipline
organization
and
armament
far
superior
above
all
they
possessed
not
only
the
traditions
of
roman
strategy
but
a
complete
system
of
tactics
carefully
elaborated
to
suit
the
requirements
of
the
age
for
centuries
war
was
studied
as
an
art
in
the
east
while
in
the
west
it
remained
merely
a
matter
of
hard
fighting
the
young
frankish
noble
deemed
his
military
education
complete
when
he
could
sit
his
charger
firmly
and
handle
lance
and
shield
with
skill
the
byzantine
patrician
while
no
less
exercised
in
arms
added
theory
to
empiric
knowledge
by
the
study
of
the
works
of
maurice
of
leo
of
nicephorus
phocas
and
of
other
authors
whose
books
survive
in
name
alone
the
results
of
the
opposite
views
taken
by
the
two
divisions
of
europe
are
what
might
have
been
expected
the
men
of
the
west
though
they
regarded
war
as
the
most
important
occupation
of
life
invariably
found
themselves
at
a
loss
when
opposed
by
an
enemy
with
whose
tactics
they
were
not
acquainted
the
generals
of
the
east
on
the
other
hand
made
it
their
boast
that
they
knew
how
to
face
and
conquer
slav
or
turk
frank
or
saracen
by
employing
in
each
case
the
tactical
means
best
adapted
to
meet
their
opponents
method
of
warfare
the
directions
for
the
various
emergencies
given
by
the
emperor
leo
impress
us
alike
as
showing
the
diversity
of
the
tasks
set
before
the
byzantine
general
and
the
practical
manner
in
which
they
were
taken
in
hand
they
serve
indeed
as
a
key
to
the
whole
system
of
the
art
of
war
as
it
was
understood
at
constantinople
the
frank
says
leo
believes
that
a
retreat
under
any
circumstances
must
be
dishonourable
hence
he
will
fight
whenever
you
choose
to
offer
him
battle
this
you
must
not
do
till
you
have
secured
all
possible
advantages
for
yourself
as
his
cavalry
with
their
long
lances
and
large
shields
charge
with
a
tremendous
impetus
you
should
deal
with
him
by
protracting
the
campaign
and
if
possible
lead
him
into
the
hills
where
his
cavalry
are
less
efficient
than
in
the
plain
after
a
few
weeks
without
a
great
battle
his
troops
who
are
very
susceptible
to
fatigue
and
weariness
will
grow
tired
of
the
war
and
ride
home
in
great
numbers
you
will
find
him
utterly
careless
as
to
outposts
and
reconnaisances
so
that
you
can
easily
cut
off
outlying
parties
of
his
men
and
attack
his
camp
at
advantage
as
his
forces
have
no
bonds
of
discipline
but
only
those
of
kindred
or
oath
they
fall
into
confusion
after
delivering
their
charge
you
can
therefore
simulate
flight
and
then
turn
them
when
you
will
find
them
in
utter
disarray
on
the
whole
however
it
is
easier
and
less
costly
to
wear
out
a
frankish
army
by
skirmishes
and
protracted
operations
rather
than
to
attempt
to
destroy
it
at
a
single
the
chapters
of
which
these
directions
are
an
abstract
have
two
distinct
points
of
interest
they
present
us
with
a
picture
of
a
western
army
of
the
ninth
or
tenth
century
the
exact
period
of
the
development
of
feudal
cavalry
drawn
by
the
critical
hand
of
an
enemy
they
also
show
the
characteristic
strength
and
weakness
of
byzantine
military
science
on
the
one
hand
we
note
that
leo
s
precepts
are
practical
and
efficacious
on
the
other
we
see
that
they
are
based
upon
the
supposition
that
the
imperial
troops
will
normally
act
upon
the
defensive
a
limitation
which
must
materially
lessen
their
efficiency
these
however
were
the
tactics
by
which
the
eastern
emperors
succeeded
in
maintaining
their
italian
themes
for
years
against
every
attack
of
lombard
duke
or
frankish
emperor
the
method
which
is
recommended
by
leo
for
resisting
the
turks
by
which
name
he
denotes
the
magyars
and
the
tribes
dwelling
north
of
the
euxine
is
different
in
every
respect
from
that
directed
against
the
nations
of
the
west
the
turkish
army
consisted
of
innumerable
bands
of
light
horsemen
who
carried
javelin
and
scimitar
but
relied
on
their
arrows
for
victory
their
tactics
were
in
fact
a
repetition
of
those
of
attila
a
foreshadowing
of
those
of
alp
arslan
or
batu
khan
the
turks
were
given
to
ambushes
and
stratagems
of
every
sort
and
were
noted
for
the
care
with
which
they
posted
their
vedettes
so
that
they
could
seldom
or
never
be
attacked
by
surprise
on
a
fair
open
field
however
they
could
be
ridden
down
by
the
byzantine
heavy
cavalry
who
are
therefore
recommended
to
close
with
them
at
once
and
not
to
exchange
arrows
with
them
at
a
distance
steady
infantry
they
could
not
break
and
indeed
they
were
averse
to
attacking
it
since
the
bows
of
the
byzantine
carried
farther
than
their
own
shorter
weapon
and
they
were
thus
liable
to
have
their
horses
shot
before
coming
within
their
own
limit
of
efficacious
range
their
armour
protected
their
own
bodies
but
not
those
of
their
chargers
and
they
might
thus
find
themselves
dismounted
in
which
position
they
were
absolutely
helpless
the
nomad
of
the
steppes
having
never
been
accustomed
to
fight
on
foot
with
the
turks
therefore
a
pitched
battle
was
desirable
but
as
they
were
prompt
at
rallying
it
was
always
necessary
to
pursue
them
with
caution
and
not
to
allow
the
troops
to
get
out
of
hand
during
the
it
is
at
once
apparent
from
these
directions
how
utterly
the
efficiency
of
the
byzantine
infantry
differed
from
that
of
the
legions
of
an
earlier
day
the
soldiers
of
the
first
century
armed
with
sword
and
pilum
alone
were
destroyed
from
a
distance
by
the
parthian
mounted
bowmen
the
adoption
of
the
bow
by
infantry
had
now
changed
the
aspect
of
affairs
and
it
was
the
who
now
found
himself
at
a
disadvantage
in
the
exchange
of
missiles
nor
could
he
hope
to
retrieve
the
day
by
charging
since
the
scutati
or
spearmen
carrying
the
large
shield
who
formed
the
front
rank
of
a
byzantine
tagma
could
keep
at
bay
horsemen
armed
not
with
the
heavy
lance
of
the
west
but
merely
with
scimitars
and
short
javelins
hence
the
turk
avoided
conflicts
with
the
imperial
infantry
and
used
his
superior
powers
of
locomotion
to
keep
out
of
its
way
it
was
only
the
cavalry
which
could
as
a
rule
come
up
with
him
the
tactics
calculated
for
success
against
the
slavs
call
for
little
notice
the
servians
and
the
slovenes
possessed
hardly
any
cavalry
and
were
chiefly
formidable
to
the
imperial
troops
when
they
kept
to
the
mountains
where
their
archers
and
posted
in
inaccessible
positions
could
annoy
the
invader
from
a
distance
or
the
spearmen
could
make
sudden
assaults
on
the
flank
of
his
marching
columns
such
attacks
could
be
frustrated
by
proper
vigilance
while
if
the
slavs
were
only
surprised
while
engaged
in
their
plundering
expeditions
into
the
plains
they
could
be
ridden
down
and
cut
to
pieces
by
the
imperial
cavalry
to
deal
with
the
saracen
on
the
other
hand
the
greatest
care
and
skill
were
required
of
all
barbarous
nations
says
leo
they
are
the
best
advised
and
the
most
prudent
in
their
military
the
commander
who
has
to
meet
with
them
will
need
all
his
tactical
and
strategical
ability
the
troops
must
be
well
disciplined
and
confident
if
the
barbarous
and
blaspheming
saracen
is
to
be
driven
back
in
rout
through
the
klissuras
of
taurus
the
arabs
whom
khaled
and
amrou
had
led
in
the
seventh
century
to
the
conquest
of
syria
and
egypt
had
owed
their
victory
neither
to
the
superiority
of
their
arms
nor
to
the
excellence
of
their
organization
the
fanatical
courage
of
the
fatalist
had
enabled
them
as
it
has
enabled
their
in
the
present
spring
to
face
better
armed
and
better
disciplined
troops
settled
in
their
new
homes
however
when
the
first
outburst
of
their
vigour
had
passed
away
they
did
not
disdain
to
learn
a
lesson
from
the
nations
they
had
defeated
accordingly
the
byzantine
army
served
as
a
model
for
the
forces
of
the
khalifs
they
have
copied
the
romans
in
most
of
their
military
practices
says
leo
both
in
arms
and
in
strategy
like
the
imperial
generals
they
placed
their
confidence
in
their
mailed
lancers
but
the
saracen
and
his
charger
were
alike
at
a
disadvantage
in
the
onset
horse
for
horse
and
man
for
man
the
byzantines
were
heavier
and
could
ride
the
orientals
down
when
the
final
shock
came
two
things
alone
rendered
the
saracens
the
most
dangerous
of
foes
their
numbers
and
their
extraordinary
powers
of
locomotion
when
an
inroad
into
asia
minor
was
projected
the
powers
of
greed
and
fanaticism
united
to
draw
together
every
unquiet
spirit
between
khorassan
and
egypt
the
wild
horsemen
of
the
east
poured
out
in
myriads
from
the
gates
of
tarsus
and
adana
to
harry
the
fertile
uplands
of
the
anatolic
themes
they
are
no
regular
troops
but
a
mixed
multitude
of
volunteers
the
rich
man
serves
from
pride
of
race
the
poor
man
from
hope
of
plunder
many
of
them
go
forth
because
they
believe
that
god
delights
in
war
and
has
promised
victory
to
them
those
who
stay
at
home
both
men
and
women
aid
in
arming
their
poorer
neighbours
and
think
that
they
are
performing
a
good
work
thereby
thus
there
is
no
homogeneity
in
their
armies
since
experienced
warriors
and
untrained
plunderers
march
side
by
side
once
clear
of
the
passes
of
taurus
the
great
horde
of
saracen
horsemen
cut
itself
loose
from
its
communications
and
rode
far
and
wide
through
phrygia
and
cappadocia
burning
the
open
towns
harrying
the
country
side
and
lading
their
beasts
of
burden
with
the
plunder
of
a
region
which
was
in
those
days
one
of
the
richest
in
the
world
now
was
the
time
for
the
byzantine
general
to
show
his
metal
first
he
had
to
come
up
with
his
enemies
and
then
to
fight
them
the
former
task
was
no
easy
matter
as
the
saracen
in
the
first
days
of
his
inroad
could
cover
an
incredible
distance
it
was
not
till
he
had
loaded
and
clogged
himself
with
plunder
that
he
was
usually
to
be
caught
when
the
news
of
the
raid
reached
the
general
of
the
anatolic
or
armeniac
theme
he
had
at
once
to
collect
every
efficient
horseman
in
his
province
and
strike
at
the
enemy
untrained
men
and
weak
horses
were
left
behind
and
the
infantry
could
not
hope
to
keep
up
with
the
rapid
movements
which
had
now
to
be
undertaken
accordingly
leo
would
send
all
the
disposable
foot
to
occupy
the
klissuras
of
the
taurus
where
even
if
the
cavalry
did
not
catch
the
invader
his
retreat
might
be
delayed
and
harassed
in
passes
where
he
could
not
fight
to
advantage
in
his
cavalry
however
lay
the
byzantine
commander
s
hope
of
success
to
ascertain
the
enemy
s
position
he
must
spare
no
trouble
never
turn
away
freeman
or
slave
by
day
or
night
though
you
may
be
sleeping
or
eating
or
bathing
writes
nicephorus
phocas
if
he
says
that
he
has
news
for
when
once
the
saracen
s
track
had
been
discovered
he
was
to
be
pursued
without
ceasing
and
his
force
and
objects
discovered
if
all
syria
and
mesopotamia
had
come
out
for
an
invasion
rather
than
a
mere
foray
the
general
must
resign
himself
to
taking
the
defensive
and
only
hang
on
the
enemy
s
flanks
cutting
off
his
stragglers
and
preventing
any
plundering
by
detached
parties
no
fighting
must
be
taken
in
hand
till
all
the
themes
of
the
east
have
been
set
marching
an
order
which
would
put
some
or
heavy
cavalry
at
the
disposal
of
the
but
would
cost
the
loss
of
much
precious
time
these
saracen
if
we
may
borrow
an
expression
from
the
similar
expeditions
of
our
own
borderers
were
of
comparatively
unfrequent
occurrence
it
was
seldom
that
the
whole
byzantine
force
in
asia
was
drawn
out
to
face
the
enemy
in
a
great
battle
the
more
typical
saracen
inroad
was
made
by
the
inhabitants
of
cilicia
and
northern
syria
with
the
assistance
of
casual
adventurers
from
the
inner
mohammedan
lands
to
meet
them
the
byzantine
commander
would
probably
have
no
more
than
the
heavy
cavalry
of
his
own
theme
in
hand
a
force
for
whose
handling
leo
gives
minute
tactical
directions
when
he
had
come
up
with
the
raiders
they
would
turn
and
offer
him
battle
nor
was
their
onset
to
be
despised
though
unequal
man
for
man
to
their
adversaries
they
were
usually
in
superior
numbers
and
always
came
on
with
great
confidence
they
are
very
bold
at
first
with
expectation
of
victory
nor
will
they
turn
at
once
even
if
their
line
is
broken
through
by
our
impact
when
they
suppose
that
their
enemy
s
vigour
is
relaxing
they
all
charge
together
with
a
desperate
effort
if
however
this
failed
a
rout
generally
ensued
for
they
think
that
all
misfortune
is
sent
by
god
and
so
if
they
are
once
beaten
they
take
their
defeat
as
a
sign
of
divine
wrath
and
no
longer
attempt
to
defend
themselves
hence
the
mussulman
army
when
once
it
turned
to
fly
could
be
pursued
l
and
the
old
military
maxim
vince
sed
ne
nimis
vincas
was
a
caution
which
the
byzantine
officer
could
disregard
the
secret
of
success
in
an
engagement
with
the
saracens
lay
in
the
cavalry
tactics
which
had
for
three
centuries
been
in
process
of
elaboration
by
the
tenth
century
they
attained
their
perfection
and
the
experienced
soldier
nicephorus
phocas
vouches
for
their
efficacy
their
distinguishing
feature
was
that
the
troops
were
always
placed
in
two
lines
and
a
reserve
with
squadrons
detached
on
the
flanks
to
prevent
their
being
turned
the
enemy
came
on
in
one
very
deep
line
and
could
never
stand
the
three
successive
shocks
as
the
first
line
second
line
and
reserve
were
one
after
another
flung
into
the
mêlée
against
them
the
byzantines
had
already
discovered
the
great
precept
which
modern
military
science
has
claimed
as
its
own
that
in
a
cavalry
combat
the
side
which
holds
back
the
last
reserve
must
win
the
exact
formation
used
on
these
occasions
being
carefully
described
by
our
authorities
is
worth
detailing
and
will
be
found
in
our
section
treating
of
the
organization
of
the
byzantine
army
there
were
several
other
methods
of
dealing
with
the
saracen
invader
it
was
sometimes
advisable
when
his
inroad
was
made
in
great
force
to
hang
about
the
rear
of
the
retreating
plunderers
and
only
fall
upon
them
when
they
were
engaged
in
passing
the
klissuras
of
the
taurus
if
infantry
was
already
on
the
spot
to
aid
the
pursuing
cavalry
success
was
almost
certain
when
the
saracens
and
their
train
of
beasts
laden
with
spoil
were
wedged
in
the
passes
they
could
then
be
shot
down
by
the
archers
and
would
not
stand
for
a
moment
when
they
saw
their
horses
the
pharii
whom
they
esteem
above
all
other
things
struck
by
arrows
from
a
distance
for
the
saracen
when
not
actually
engaged
in
close
combat
would
do
anything
to
save
his
horse
from
harm
cold
and
rainy
weather
was
also
distasteful
to
the
oriental
invader
at
times
when
it
prevailed
he
did
not
display
his
ordinary
firmness
and
daring
and
could
be
attacked
at
great
advantage
much
could
also
be
done
by
delivering
a
vigorous
raid
into
his
country
and
wasting
cilicia
and
northern
syria
the
moment
his
armies
were
reported
to
have
passed
north
into
cappadocia
this
destructive
practice
was
very
frequently
adopted
and
the
sight
of
two
enemies
each
ravaging
the
other
s
territory
without
attempting
to
defend
his
own
was
only
too
familiar
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
borderlands
of
christendom
and
islam
incursions
by
sea
supplemented
the
forays
by
land
when
the
saracens
of
cilicia
have
gone
off
by
the
passes
to
harry
the
country
north
of
taurus
says
leo
the
commander
of
the
cibyrrhœot
theme
should
immediately
go
on
shipboard
with
all
available
forces
and
ravage
their
coast
if
on
the
other
hand
they
have
sailed
off
to
attempt
the
shore
districts
of
pisidia
the
klissurarchs
of
taurus
can
lay
waste
the
territories
of
tarsus
and
adana
without
nothing
can
show
more
clearly
than
these
directions
the
high
average
skill
of
the
byzantine
officer
leo
himself
was
not
a
man
of
any
great
ability
and
his
tactica
are
intended
to
codify
an
existing
military
art
rather
than
to
construct
a
new
one
yet
still
the
book
is
one
whose
equal
could
not
have
been
written
in
western
europe
before
the
sixteenth
century
one
of
its
most
striking
points
is
the
utter
difference
of
its
tone
from
that
of
contemporary
feeling
in
the
rest
of
christendom
of
chivalry
there
is
not
a
spark
in
the
byzantine
though
professional
pride
is
abundantly
shown
courage
is
regarded
as
one
of
the
requisites
necessary
for
obtaining
success
not
as
the
sole
and
paramount
virtue
of
the
warrior
leo
considers
a
campaign
successfully
concluded
without
a
great
battle
as
the
cheapest
and
most
satisfactory
consummation
in
war
he
has
no
respect
for
the
warlike
ardour
which
makes
men
eager
to
plunge
into
the
fray
it
is
to
him
rather
a
characteristic
of
the
brainless
barbarian
and
an
attribute
fatal
to
any
one
who
makes
any
pretension
to
generalship
he
shows
a
strong
predilection
for
stratagems
ambushes
and
simulated
retreats
for
an
officer
who
fights
without
having
first
secured
all
the
advantages
to
his
own
side
he
has
the
greatest
contempt
it
is
with
a
kind
of
intellectual
pride
that
he
gives
instructions
how
are
to
be
sent
to
the
enemy
without
any
real
object
except
that
of
spying
out
the
number
and
efficiency
of
his
forces
he
gives
as
a
piece
of
most
ordinary
and
moral
advice
the
hint
that
a
defeated
general
may
often
find
time
to
execute
a
retreat
by
sending
an
emissary
to
propose
a
surrender
which
he
has
no
intention
of
carrying
out
to
the
hostile
commander
he
is
not
above
employing
the
trick
of
addressing
treasonable
letters
to
the
subordinate
officers
of
the
enemy
s
army
and
contriving
that
they
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
in
order
that
he
may
be
made
suspicious
of
his
lieutenants
schemes
such
as
these
are
byzantine
in
the
worst
sense
of
the
word
but
their
character
must
not
be
allowed
to
blind
us
to
the
real
and
extraordinary
merits
of
the
strategical
system
into
which
they
have
been
inserted
the
art
of
war
as
understood
at
constantinople
in
the
tenth
century
was
the
only
scheme
of
true
scientific
merit
existing
in
the
world
and
was
unrivalled
till
the
sixteenth
century
organization
and
tactics
of
the
byzantine
the
byzantine
army
may
be
said
to
owe
its
peculiar
form
to
the
emperor
maurice
a
prince
whose
reign
is
one
of
the
chief
landmarks
in
the
history
of
the
lower
empire
the
fortunate
preservation
of
his
stratêgikon
suffices
to
show
us
that
the
reorganization
of
the
troops
of
the
east
was
mainly
due
to
him
contemporary
historians
also
mention
his
reforms
but
without
descending
to
details
and
inform
us
that
though
destined
to
endure
they
won
him
much
unpopularity
among
the
soldiery
later
writers
however
have
erroneously
attributed
these
changes
to
the
more
celebrated
warrior
heraclius
the
prince
who
bore
the
roman
standards
further
than
any
of
his
predecessors
into
the
lands
of
the
east
in
reality
the
army
of
heraclius
had
already
been
reorganized
by
the
worthy
but
unfortunate
maurice
the
most
important
of
maurice
s
alterations
was
the
elimination
of
that
system
somewhat
resembling
the
teutonic
comitatus
which
had
crept
from
among
the
foederati
into
the
ranks
of
the
regular
roman
army
the
loyalty
of
the
soldier
was
secured
rather
to
the
emperor
than
to
his
immediate
superiors
by
making
the
appointment
of
all
officers
above
the
rank
of
centurion
a
care
of
the
central
government
the
commander
of
an
army
or
division
had
thus
no
longer
in
his
hands
the
power
and
patronage
which
had
given
him
the
opportunity
of
becoming
dangerous
to
the
state
the
men
found
themselves
under
the
orders
of
delegates
of
the
emperor
not
of
authorities
who
enlisted
them
as
personal
followers
rather
than
as
units
in
the
military
establishment
of
the
empire
this
reform
maurice
succeeded
in
carrying
out
to
the
great
benefit
of
the
discipline
and
loyalty
of
his
army
he
next
took
in
hand
the
reducing
of
the
whole
force
of
the
empire
to
a
single
form
of
organization
the
rapid
decrease
of
the
revenues
of
the
state
which
had
set
in
towards
the
end
of
justinian
s
reign
and
continued
to
make
itself
more
and
more
felt
had
apparently
resulted
in
a
great
diminution
in
the
number
of
foreign
mercenaries
serving
in
the
roman
army
to
the
same
end
contributed
the
fact
that
of
the
lombards
herules
and
gepidæ
the
nations
who
had
furnished
the
majority
of
the
imperial
foederati
one
race
had
removed
to
other
seats
while
the
others
had
been
exterminated
at
last
the
number
of
the
foreign
corps
had
sunk
to
such
a
low
ebb
that
there
was
no
military
danger
incurred
in
assimilating
their
organization
to
that
of
the
rest
of
the
army
the
new
system
introduced
by
maurice
was
destined
to
last
for
nearly
five
hundred
years
its
unit
alike
for
infantry
and
cavalry
was
the
βάνδον
bandon
a
weak
battalion
or
of
men
commanded
by
an
officer
who
usually
bore
the
vulgarized
title
of
comes
but
was
occasionally
denominated
by
the
older
name
of
τριβῶνος
tribônos
or
military
tribune
three
bands
or
τάγματα
tagmata
as
they
were
sometimes
styled
formed
a
small
brigade
called
indifferently
μοῖρα
moira
χιλιαρχία
chiliarchia
or
δροῦγγος
droungos
three
drunges
formed
the
largest
military
group
recognised
by
maurice
and
the
division
made
by
their
union
was
the
turma
or
μέρος
meros
nothing
can
be
more
characteristic
of
the
whole
byzantine
military
system
than
the
curious
juxtaposition
of
latin
greek
and
german
words
in
its
terminology
upon
the
substratum
of
the
old
roman
survivals
we
find
first
a
layer
of
teutonic
names
introduced
by
the
foederati
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
and
finally
numerous
greek
denominations
some
of
them
borrowed
from
the
old
macedonian
military
system
others
newly
invented
the
whole
official
language
of
the
empire
was
in
fact
still
in
a
state
of
flux
maurice
himself
was
hailed
by
his
subjects
as
pius
felix
augustus
though
those
who
used
the
title
were
for
the
most
part
accustomed
to
speak
in
greek
in
the
stratêgikon
the
two
tongues
are
inextricably
mixed
before
the
battle
says
the
emperor
let
the
counts
face
their
bands
and
raise
the
δεοῦς
νοβισκοῦμ
deous
nobiskoum
deus
nobiscum
and
the
troopers
will
shout
the
answering
cry
κύριε
ἐλέησον
kyrie
eleêson
it
would
appear
that
maurice
had
intended
to
break
down
the
barrier
which
had
been
interposed
in
the
fourth
century
between
the
class
which
paid
the
taxes
and
that
which
recruited
the
national
army
we
wish
he
writes
that
every
young
roman
of
free
condition
should
learn
the
use
of
the
bow
and
should
be
constantly
provided
with
that
weapon
and
with
two
if
however
this
was
intended
to
be
the
first
step
towards
the
introduction
of
universal
military
service
the
design
was
never
carried
any
further
three
hundred
years
later
leo
is
found
echoing
the
same
words
as
a
pious
wish
rather
than
as
a
practical
expedient
the
rank
and
file
however
of
the
imperial
forces
were
now
raised
almost
entirely
within
the
realm
and
well
nigh
every
nation
contained
in
its
limits
except
the
greeks
furnished
a
considerable
number
of
soldiers
the
armenians
and
isaurians
in
asia
the
thracians
and
macedonians
or
more
properly
the
slavs
in
europe
were
considered
the
best
material
by
the
recruiting
officer
the
extraordinary
permanence
of
all
byzantine
institutions
is
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
maurice
s
arrangements
were
found
almost
unchanged
three
hundred
years
after
his
death
the
chapters
of
leo
s
tactica
which
deal
with
the
armament
and
organization
of
the
troops
are
little
more
than
a
reëdition
of
the
similar
parts
of
his
predecessor
s
the
description
of
the
heavy
and
light
horseman
and
of
the
infantry
soldier
are
identical
in
the
two
works
except
in
a
few
points
of
terminology
the
καβαλλάριος
kaballarios
or
heavy
trooper
wore
at
both
epochs
a
steel
cap
surmounted
by
a
small
crest
and
a
long
mail
shirt
reaching
from
the
neck
to
the
thighs
he
was
also
protected
by
gauntlets
and
and
usually
wore
a
light
surcoat
over
his
mail
the
horses
of
the
officers
and
of
the
men
in
the
front
rank
were
furnished
with
steel
frontlets
and
poitrails
the
arms
of
the
soldier
were
a
σπάθιον
spathion
a
dagger
παραμήριον
paramêrion
a
horseman
s
bow
and
quiver
and
a
long
lance
κοντάριον
kontarion
fitted
with
a
thong
towards
its
butt
and
ornamented
with
a
little
bannerole
the
colour
of
bannerole
crest
and
surcoat
was
that
of
the
regimental
standard
and
no
two
bands
in
the
same
turma
had
standards
of
the
same
hue
thus
the
line
presented
an
uniform
and
orderly
appearance
every
band
displaying
its
own
regimental
facings
strapped
to
his
saddle
each
horseman
carried
a
long
cloak
which
he
assumed
in
cold
and
rainy
weather
or
when
for
purposes
of
concealment
he
wished
to
avoid
displaying
the
glitter
of
his
armour
the
light
trooper
had
less
complete
equipment
sometimes
a
cuirass
of
mail
or
horn
at
others
only
a
light
mail
cape
covering
the
neck
and
shoulders
he
carried
a
large
shield
a
defence
which
the
heavy
horseman
could
not
adopt
on
account
of
his
requiring
both
hands
to
draw
his
bow
for
arms
the
light
cavalry
carried
lance
and
sword
the
infantry
which
was
much
inferior
to
the
horsemen
in
importance
was
like
them
divided
into
two
descriptions
heavy
and
light
the
scutati
σκουτάτοι
skoutátoi
or
troops
of
the
former
class
wore
a
steel
helmet
with
a
crest
and
a
short
mail
shirt
they
carried
a
large
oblong
shield
θύρις
thyris
which
like
their
crests
was
of
the
same
colour
as
the
regimental
banner
their
chief
weapon
was
a
short
but
heavy
τζικούριον
tzikourion
securis
with
a
blade
in
front
and
a
spike
behind
they
were
also
provided
with
a
dagger
the
light
infantry
ψιλοί
psiloi
wore
no
defensive
armour
they
were
provided
with
a
powerful
bow
which
carried
much
further
than
the
horseman
s
weapon
and
was
therefore
very
formidable
to
hostile
a
few
corps
drawn
from
provinces
where
the
bow
was
not
well
known
carried
instead
two
or
three
javelins
ῥιπτάρια
rhiptaria
for
hand
to
hand
fighting
the
psiloi
were
provided
with
an
axe
similar
to
that
of
the
scutati
and
a
very
small
round
target
which
hung
at
their
waists
an
extensive
train
of
was
attached
to
the
army
among
the
cavalry
every
four
troopers
had
a
groom
among
the
infantry
every
sixteen
men
were
provided
with
an
attendant
who
drove
a
cart
containing
a
a
a
saw
two
spades
a
mallet
a
large
wicker
basket
a
scythe
and
two
besides
several
other
utensils
for
whose
identity
the
dictionary
gives
no
clue
thus
twenty
spades
and
twenty
per
century
were
always
forthcoming
for
entrenching
purposes
a
consummation
for
which
the
modern
infantry
company
would
be
glad
if
it
could
find
a
parallel
so
perfect
was
the
organization
of
the
byzantine
army
that
it
contained
not
only
a
military
train
but
even
an
of
bearers
σκριβῶνοι
skribônoi
and
surgeons
the
value
attached
to
the
lives
of
the
soldiery
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
scriboni
received
a
nomisma
for
every
wounded
man
whom
they
brought
off
when
the
troops
were
retiring
special
officers
were
told
to
superintend
the
march
of
this
mass
of
and
vehicles
which
is
collectively
styled
tuldum
τοῦλδον
touldon
and
forms
not
the
least
part
among
the
cares
of
the
laborious
author
of
the
those
portions
of
the
works
of
maurice
and
leo
which
deal
with
tactics
show
a
far
greater
difference
between
the
methods
of
the
sixth
and
the
ninth
centuries
than
is
observable
in
other
parts
of
their
military
systems
the
chapters
of
leo
are
as
is
but
natural
of
a
more
interesting
character
than
those
of
his
predecessor
the
more
important
of
his
ordinances
are
well
worthy
our
attention
it
is
first
observable
that
the
old
roman
system
of
drawing
entrenchments
round
the
army
every
time
that
it
rested
for
the
night
had
been
resumed
a
corps
of
engineers
μένσορες
mensores
sic
always
marched
with
the
and
when
the
evening
halt
had
been
called
traced
out
with
stakes
and
ropes
the
contour
of
the
camp
when
the
main
body
had
come
up
the
tuldum
was
placed
in
the
centre
of
the
enclosure
while
the
infantry
bands
drew
a
ditch
and
bank
along
the
lines
of
the
mensores
ropes
each
corps
doing
a
fixed
amount
of
the
work
a
thick
chain
of
picquets
was
kept
far
out
from
the
camp
so
that
a
surprise
even
on
the
darkest
of
nights
was
almost
impossible
the
main
characteristic
of
the
byzantine
system
of
tactics
is
the
small
size
of
the
various
units
employed
in
the
operations
a
sure
sign
of
the
existence
of
a
high
degree
of
discipline
and
training
while
a
western
army
went
on
its
blundering
way
arranged
in
two
or
three
enormous
battles
each
mustering
many
thousand
men
a
byzantine
army
of
equal
strength
would
be
divided
into
many
scores
of
fractions
leo
does
not
seem
to
contemplate
the
existence
of
any
column
of
greater
strength
than
that
of
a
single
the
fact
that
order
and
cohesion
could
be
found
in
a
line
composed
of
so
many
separate
units
is
the
best
testimony
to
the
high
average
ability
of
the
officers
in
subordinate
commands
these
counts
and
moirarchs
were
in
the
ninth
and
tenth
centuries
drawn
for
the
most
part
from
the
ranks
of
the
byzantine
aristocracy
nothing
prevents
us
says
leo
from
finding
a
sufficient
supply
of
men
of
wealth
and
also
of
courage
and
high
birth
to
officer
our
army
their
nobility
makes
them
respected
by
the
soldiers
while
their
wealth
enables
them
to
win
the
greatest
popularity
among
their
troops
by
the
occasional
and
judicious
gift
of
small
a
true
military
spirit
existed
among
the
noble
families
of
the
eastern
empire
houses
like
those
of
skleros
and
phocas
of
bryennius
kerkuas
and
comnenus
are
found
furnishing
generation
after
generation
of
officers
to
the
national
army
the
patrician
left
luxury
and
intrigue
behind
him
when
he
passed
through
the
gates
of
constantinople
and
became
in
the
field
a
keen
professional
soldier
infantry
plays
in
leo
s
work
a
very
secondary
part
so
much
is
this
the
case
that
in
many
of
his
tactical
directions
he
gives
a
sketch
of
the
order
to
be
observed
by
the
cavalry
alone
without
mentioning
the
foot
this
results
from
the
fact
that
when
the
conflict
was
one
with
a
rapidly
moving
foe
like
the
saracen
or
turk
the
infantry
would
at
the
moment
of
battle
be
in
all
probability
many
marches
in
the
rear
it
is
therefore
with
the
design
of
showing
the
most
typical
development
of
byzantine
tactics
that
we
have
selected
for
description
a
turma
of
nine
bands
or
men
as
placed
in
order
before
engaging
with
an
enemy
whose
force
consists
of
horsemen
the
front
line
consists
of
three
banda
each
drawn
up
in
a
line
seven
or
occasionally
five
deep
these
troops
are
to
receive
the
first
shock
behind
the
first
line
is
arranged
a
second
consisting
of
four
each
drawn
up
ten
or
occasionally
eight
deep
they
are
placed
not
directly
behind
the
front
bands
but
in
the
intervals
between
them
so
that
if
the
first
line
is
repulsed
they
may
fall
back
not
on
to
their
comrades
but
into
the
spaces
between
them
to
produce
however
an
impression
of
solidity
in
the
second
line
a
single
bandon
is
divided
into
three
parts
and
its
men
drawn
up
two
deep
in
the
spaces
between
the
four
these
troops
on
seeing
the
men
of
the
first
line
beaten
back
and
falling
into
the
intervals
of
the
second
line
are
directed
to
wheel
to
the
rear
and
form
a
support
behind
the
centre
of
the
array
the
main
reserve
however
consists
of
two
posted
on
the
flanks
of
the
second
line
but
considerably
to
the
rear
it
is
in
line
with
these
that
the
retiring
bandon
of
which
we
have
just
spoken
would
array
itself
to
each
flank
of
the
main
body
was
attached
a
of
men
these
were
called
πλαγιοφύλακες
plagiophylakes
and
were
entrusted
with
the
duty
of
resisting
attempts
to
turn
the
flanks
of
the
still
further
out
and
if
possible
under
cover
were
placed
two
other
bodies
of
similar
strength
it
was
their
duty
to
endeavour
to
get
into
the
enemy
s
rear
or
at
any
rate
to
disturb
his
wings
by
unexpected
assaults
these
troops
were
called
ἔνεδροι
enedroi
or
the
commander
s
position
was
normally
in
the
centre
of
the
second
line
where
he
would
be
able
to
obtain
a
better
general
idea
of
the
fight
than
if
he
at
once
threw
himself
into
the
at
the
head
of
the
foremost
squadrons
this
order
of
battle
is
deserving
of
all
praise
it
provides
for
that
succession
of
shocks
which
is
the
key
to
victory
in
a
cavalry
combat
as
many
as
five
different
attacks
would
be
made
on
the
enemy
before
all
the
impetus
of
the
byzantine
force
had
been
exhausted
the
arrangement
of
the
second
line
behind
the
intervals
of
the
first
obviated
the
possibility
of
the
whole
force
being
disordered
by
the
repulse
of
the
first
squadrons
the
routed
troops
would
have
behind
them
a
clear
space
in
which
to
rally
not
a
close
line
into
which
they
would
carry
their
disarray
finally
the
charge
of
the
reserve
and
the
detached
troops
would
be
made
not
on
the
enemy
s
centre
which
would
be
covered
by
the
remains
of
the
first
and
second
lines
but
on
to
his
flank
his
most
uncovered
and
vulnerable
point
a
further
idea
of
the
excellent
organization
of
the
byzantine
army
will
be
given
by
the
fact
that
in
minor
engagements
each
corps
was
told
off
into
two
parts
one
of
which
the
cursores
κούρσορες
koursores
represented
the
skirmishing
line
the
other
the
defensores
διφένσορες
diphensores
the
the
former
in
the
case
of
the
would
of
course
consist
of
the
archers
the
latter
of
the
scutati
to
give
a
complete
sketch
of
leo
s
tactics
would
be
tedious
and
unnecessary
enough
indications
have
now
been
given
to
show
their
strength
and
completeness
it
is
easy
to
understand
after
a
perusal
of
such
directions
the
permanence
of
the
military
power
of
the
eastern
empire
against
the
undisciplined
slav
and
saracen
the
imperial
troops
had
on
all
normal
occasions
the
tremendous
advantages
of
science
and
discipline
it
is
their
defeats
rather
than
their
victories

need

the

of

at
this
fight
the
rashness
of
romanus
diogenes
led
to
the
annihilation
of
the
forces
of
the
asiatic
themes
by
the
of
the
decay
of

is

of
isaac
comnenus
the
nominee
of
the
feudal
party
of
asiatic
nobles
may
have
already
enfeebled
the
army
it
was
however
the
result
of
manzikert
which
was
fatal
to
it
as
the
occupation
of
the
themes
of
the
interior
of
asia
minor
by
the
seljuks
cut
off
from
the
empire
its
greatest
the
land
of
the
gallant
isaurians
and
armenians
who
had
for
five
hundred
years
formed
the
core
of
the
eastern
army
it
will
be
observed
that
we
have
given
no
long
account
of
the
famous
the
one
point
in
byzantine
military
affairs
which
most
authors
condescend
to
notice
if
we
have
neglected
it
it
is
from
a
conviction
that
although
its
importance
in
poliorcetics
and
naval
fighting
was
considerable
it
was
after
all
a
minor
engine
of
war
and
not
comparable
as
a
cause
of
byzantine
success
to
the
excellent
strategical
and
tactical
system
on
which
we
have
dilated
very
much
the
same
conclusion
may
be
drawn
from
a
study
of
the
other
purely
mechanical
devices
which
existed
in
the
hands
of
the
imperial
generals
the
old
skill
of
the
roman
engineer
was
preserved
almost
in
its
entirety
and
the
armouries
of
constantinople
were
filled
with
machines
whose
deadly
efficacy
inspired
the
ruder
peoples
of
the
west
and
east
with
a
mysterious
feeling
of
awe
the
vinea
and
testudo
the
catapult
onager
and
balista
were
as
well
known
in
the
tenth
century
as
in
the
first
they
were
undoubtedly
employed
and
employed
with
effect
at
every
siege
but
no
amount
of
technical
skill
in
the
use
of
military
machines
would
have
sufficed
to
account
for
the
ascendancy
enjoyed
by
the
byzantines
over
their
warlike
neighbours
the
sources
of
that
superiority
are
to
be
sought
in
the
existence
of
science
and
discipline
of
strategy
and
tactics
of
a
professional
and
yet
national
army
of
an
upper
class
at
once
educated
and
military
when
the
aristocracy
became
mere
courtiers
when
foreign
mercenaries
superseded
the
isaurian
bowman
and
the
anatolic
cavalier
when
the
traditions
of
old
roman
organization
gave
place
to
mere
centralization
then
no
amount
of
the
inherited
mechanical
skill
of
past
ages
could
save
the
byzantine
empire
from
its
fall
the
rude
vigour
of
the
western
knight
accomplished
the
task
which
chosroes
and
crumn
moslemah
and
sviatoslaf
had
found
too
hard
for
them
but
it
was
not
the
empire
of
heraclius
or
john
zimisces
of
leo
the
isaurian
or
leo
the
armenian
that
was
subdued
by
the
piratical
crusaders
it
was
only
the
diminished
and
disorganized
realm
of
the
miserable
alexius
angelus
iv
the
supremacy
of
feudal
cavalry
from
the
battle
of
hastings
to
the
battles
of
morgarten
and
cressy
between
the
last
struggles
of
the
infantry
of
the
and
the
rise
of
the
pikemen
and
bowmen
of
the
fourteenth
century
lies
the
period
of
the
supremacy
of
the
feudal
horseman
the
epoch
is
as
far
as
strategy
and
tactics
are
concerned
one
of
almost
complete
stagnation
only
in
the
single
branch
of
poliorcetics
does
the
art
of
war
make
any
appreciable
progress
the
feudal
organization
of
society
made
every
person
of
gentle
blood
a
fighting
man
but
it
can
not
be
said
that
it
made
him
a
soldier
if
he
could
sit
his
charger
steadily
and
handle
lance
and
sword
with
skill
the
horseman
of
the
twelfth
or
thirteenth
century
imagined
himself
to
be
a
model
of
military
efficiency
that
discipline
or
tactical
skill
may
be
as
important
to
an
army
as
mere
courage
he
had
no
conception
assembled
with
difficulty
insubordinate
unable
to
manœuvre
ready
to
melt
away
from
its
standard
the
moment
that
its
short
period
of
service
was
over
a
feudal
force
presented
an
assemblage
of
unsoldierlike
qualities
such
as
has
seldom
been
known
to
coexist
primarily
intended
to
defend
its
own
borders
from
the
magyar
the
northman
or
the
saracen
the
foes
who
in
the
tenth
century
had
been
a
real
danger
to
christendom
the
institution
was
utterly
unadapted
to
take
the
offensive
when
a
number
of
had
come
together
each
blindly
jealous
of
his
fellows
and
recognizing
no
superior
but
the
king
it
would
require
a
leader
of
uncommon
skill
to
persuade
them
to
institute
that
hierarchy
of
command
which
must
be
established
in
every
army
that
is
to
be
something
more
than
an
undisciplined
mob
monarchs
might
try
to
obviate
the
danger
by
the
creation
of
offices
such
as
those
of
the
constable
and
marshal
but
these
expedients
were
mere
palliatives
the
radical
vice
of
insubordination
continued
to
exist
it
was
always
possible
that
at
some
critical
moment
a
battle
might
be
precipitated
a
formation
broken
a
plan
disconcerted
by
the
rashness
of
some
petty
baron
or
banneret
who
could
listen
to
nothing
but
the
promptings
of
his
own
heady
valour
when
the
hierarchy
of
command
was
based
on
social
status
rather
than
on
professional
experience
the
noble
who
led
the
largest
contingent
or
held
the
highest
rank
felt
himself
entitled
to
assume
the
direction
of
the
battle
the
veteran
who
brought
only
a
few
lances
to
the
array
could
seldom
aspire
to
influencing
the
movements
of
his
superiors
when
mere
courage
takes
the
place
of
skill
and
experience
tactics
and
strategy
alike
disappear
arrogance
and
stupidity
combine
to
give
a
certain
definite
colour
to
the
proceedings
of
the
average
feudal
host
the
century
and
the
land
may
differ
but
the
incidents
of
battle
are
the
same
mansoura
is
like
aljubarotta
nicopolis
is
like
courtrai
when
the
enemy
came
in
sight
nothing
could
restrain
the
western
knights
the
shield
was
shifted
into
position
the
lance
dropped
into
rest
the
spur
touched
the
charger
and
the
line
thundered
on
regardless
of
what
might
be
before
it
as
often
as
not
its
career
ended
in
being
dashed
against
a
stone
wall
or
tumbled
into
a
canal
in
painful
flounderings
in
a
bog
or
futile
surgings
around
a
palisade
the
enemy
who
possessed
even
a
rudimentary
system
of
tactics
could
hardly
fail
to
be
successful
against
such
armies
the
fight
of
mansoura
may
be
taken
as
a
fair
specimen
of
the
military
customs
of
the
thirteenth
century
when
the
french
vanguard
saw
a
fair
field
before
them
and
the
lances
of
the
infidel
gleaming
among
the
they
could
not
restrain
their
eagerness
with
the
count
of
artois
at
their
head
they
started
off
in
a
headlong
charge
in
spite
of
louis
strict
prohibition
of
an
engagement
the
mamelukes
retreated
allowed
their
pursuers
to
entangle
themselves
in
the
streets
of
a
town
and
then
turned
fiercely
on
them
from
all
sides
at
once
in
a
short
time
the
whole
battle
of
the
count
of
artois
was
dispersed
and
cut
to
pieces
meanwhile
the
hearing
of
the
danger
of
their
companions
had
ridden
off
hastily
to
their
aid
however
as
each
commander
took
his
own
route
and
made
what
speed
he
could
the
french
army
arrived
upon
the
field
in
dozens
of
small
scattered
bodies
these
were
attacked
in
detail
and
in
many
cases
routed
by
the
mamelukes
no
general
battle
was
fought
but
a
number
of
detached
and
incoherent
cavalry
combats
had
all
the
results
of
a
great
defeat
a
skirmish
and
a
street
fight
could
overthrow
the
chivalry
of
the
west
even
when
it
went
forth
in
great
strength
and
was
inspired
by
all
the
enthusiasm
of
a
crusade
the
array
of
a
feudal
force
was
stereotyped
to
a
single
pattern
as
it
was
impossible
to
combine
the
movements
of
many
small
bodies
when
the
troops
were
neither
disciplined
nor
accustomed
to
act
together
it
was
usual
to
form
the
whole
of
the
cavalry
into
three
great
masses
or
battles
as
they
were
called
and
launch
them
at
the
enemy
the
refinement
of
keeping
a
reserve
in
hand
was
practised
by
a
few
commanders
but
these
were
men
distinctly
in
advance
of
their
age
indeed
it
would
often
have
been
hard
to
persuade
a
feudal
chief
to
take
a
position
out
of
the
front
line
and
to
incur
the
risk
of
losing
his
share
in
the
hard
fighting
when
two
battles
met
a
fearful
ensued
and
would
often
be
continued
for
hours
sometimes
as
if
by
agreement
the
two
parties
wheeled
to
the
rear
to
give
their
horses
breath
and
then
rushed
at
each
other
again
to
renew
the
conflict
till
one
side
grew
overmatched
and
left
the
field
an
engagement
like
brenville
or
bouvines
or
benevento
was
nothing
more
than
a
huge
scuffle
and
scramble
of
horses
and
men
over
a
convenient
heath
or
hillside
the
most
ordinary
precautions
such
as
directing
a
reserve
on
a
critical
point
or
detaching
a
corps
to
take
the
enemy
in
flank
or
selecting
a
good
position
in
which
to
receive
battle
were
considered
instances
of
surpassing
military
skill
charles
of
anjou
for
instance
has
received
the
name
of
a
great
commander
because
at
tagliacozzo
he
retained
a
body
of
knights
under
cover
and
launched
it
against
conradin
s
rear
when
the
ghibellines
had
dispersed
in
pursuit
of
the
routed
angevin
simon
de
montfort
earned
high
repute
but
if
at
lewes
he
kept
and
utilized
a
reserve
we
must
not
forget
that
at
evesham
he
allowed
himself
to
be
surprised
and
forced
to
fight
with
his
back
to
a
river
in
a
position
from
which
no
retreat
was
possible
the
commendation
of
the
age
was
in
short
the
meed
of
striking
feats
of
arms
rather
than
of
real
generalship
if
much
attention
were
to
be
paid
to
the
chroniclers
we
should
believe
that
commanders
of
merit
were
numerous
but
if
we
examine
the
actions
of
these
individuals
rather
than
the
opinions
of
their
contemporaries
our
belief
in
their
ability
almost
invariably
receives
a
rude
shock
if
the
minor
operations
of
war
were
badly
understood
strategy
the
higher
branch
of
the
military
art
was
absolutely
an
invading
army
moved
into
hostile
territory
not
in
order
to
strike
at
some
great
strategical
point
but
merely
to
burn
and
harry
the
land
as
no
organized
commissariat
existed
the
resources
of
even
the
richest
districts
were
soon
exhausted
and
the
invader
moved
off
in
search
of
subsistence
rather
than
for
any
higher
aim
it
is
only
towards
the
end
of
the
period
with
which
we
are
dealing
that
any
traces
of
systematic
arrangements
for
the
provisioning
of
an
army
are
found
even
these
were
for
the
most
part
the
results
of
sheer
necessity
in
attacking
a
poor
and
uncultivated
territory
like
wales
or
scotland
the
english
kings
found
that
they
could
not
live
on
the
country
and
were
compelled
to
take
measures
to
keep
their
troops
from
starvation
but
a
french
or
german
army
when
it
entered
flanders
or
lombardy
or
an
english
force
in
france
trusted
as
all
facts
unite
to
demonstrate
for
its
maintenance
to
its
power
of
plundering
the
invaded
district
great
battles
were
on
the
whole
infrequent
a
fact
which
appears
strange
when
the
wars
of
the
period
are
taken
into
consideration
whole
years
of
hostilities
produced
only
a
few
partial
skirmishes
compared
with
modern
campaigns
the
general
engagements
were
incredibly
few
frederick
the
great
or
napoleon
fought
more
battles
in
one
year
than
a
mediæval
commander
in
ten
the
fact
would
appear
to
be
that
the
opposing
armies
being
guided
by
no
very
definite
aims
and
invariably
neglecting
to
keep
touch
of
each
other
by
means
of
outposts
and
vedettes
might
often
miss
each
other
altogether
when
they
met
it
was
usually
from
the
existence
of
some
topographical
necessity
of
an
old
roman
road
or
a
ford
or
bridge
on
which
all
routes
converged
nothing
could
show
the
primitive
state
of
the
military
art
better
than
the
fact
that
generals
solemnly
sent
and
accepted
challenges
to
meet
in
battle
at
a
given
place
and
on
a
given
day
without
such
precautions
there
was
apparently
a
danger
lest
the
armies
should
lose
sight
of
each
other
and
stray
away
in
different
directions
when
maps
were
and
geographical
knowledge
both
scanty
and
inaccurate
this
was
no
inconceivable
event
even
when
two
forces
were
actually
in
presence
it
sometimes
required
more
skill
than
the
commanders
owned
to
bring
on
a
battle
bela
of
hungary
and
ottokar
of
bohemia
were
in
arms
in
and
both
were
equally
bent
on
fighting
but
when
they
sighted
each
other
it
was
only
to
find
that
the
river
march
was
between
them
to
pass
a
stream
in
face
of
an
enemy
was
a
task
far
beyond
the
ability
of
a
general
as
louis
had
found
two
years
earlier
on
the
banks
of
the
achmoum
canal
accordingly
it
was
reckoned
nothing
strange
when
the
bohemian
courteously
invited
his
adversary
either
to
cross
the
march
unhindered
and
fight
in
due
form
on
the
west
bank
or
to
give
him
the
same
opportunity
and
grant
a
free
passage
to
the
hungarian
side
bela
chose
the
former
alternative
forded
the
river
without
molestation
and
fought
on
the
other
side
the
disastrous
battle
of
cressenbrunn
infantry
was
in
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
absolutely
insignificant
accompanied
the
army
for
no
better
purpose
than
to
perform
the
menial
duties
of
the
camp
or
to
assist
in
the
numerous
sieges
of
the
period
occasionally
they
were
employed
as
light
troops
to
open
the
battle
by
their
ineffective
demonstrations
there
was
however
no
really
important
part
for
them
to
play
indeed
their
lords
were
sometimes
affronted
if
they
presumed
to
delay
too
long
the
opening
of
the
cavalry
charges
and
ended
the
skirmishing
by
riding
into
and
over
their
wretched
followers
at
bouvines
the
count
of
boulogne
could
find
no
better
use
for
his
infantry
than
to
form
them
into
a
great
circle
inside
which
he
and
his
horsemen
took
shelter
when
their
chargers
were
fatigued
and
needed
a
short
rest
if
great
bodies
of
foot
occasionally
appeared
upon
the
field
they
came
because
it
was
the
duty
of
every
man
to
join
the
when
summoned
not
because
the
addition
of
or
peasants
and
burghers
was
calculated
to
increase
the
real
strength
of
the
levy
the
chief
cause
of
their
military
worthlessness
may
be
said
to
have
been
the
miscellaneous
nature
of
their
armament
troops
like
the
scotch
lowlanders
with
their
long
spears
or
the
saracen
auxiliaries
of
frederick
ii
with
their
deserved
and
obtained
some
respect
on
account
of
the
uniformity
of
their
equipment
but
with
ordinary
infantry
the
case
was
different
exposed
without
discipline
and
with
a
miscellaneous
assortment
of
dissimilar
weapons
to
a
cavalry
charge
they
could
not
combine
to
withstand
it
but
were
ridden
down
and
crushed
a
few
infantry
successes
which
appear
towards
the
end
of
the
period
were
altogether
exceptional
in
character
the
infantry
of
the
great
company
in
the
east
beat
the
duke
of
athens
by
inducing
him
to
charge
with
all
his
into
a
swamp
in
a
similar
way
the
victory
of
courtrai
was
secured
not
by
the
mallets
and
staves
of
the
flemings
but
by
the
canal
into
which
the
headlong
onset
of
the
french
cavalry
thrust
rank
after
rank
of
their
companions
the
attempt
to
introduce
some
degree
of
efficiency
into
a
feudal
force
drove
monarchs
to
various
expedients
frederick
barbarossa
strove
to
enforce
discipline
by
a
strict
code
of
camp
laws
an
undertaking
in
which
he
won
no
great
success
if
we
may
judge
of
their
observance
by
certain
recorded
incidents
in
for
example
egbert
von
buten
a
young
austrian
noble
left
his
post
and
started
off
with
a
thousand
men
to
endeavour
to
seize
one
of
the
gates
of
milan
a
presumptuous
violation
of
orders
in
which
he
lost
his
life
this
was
only
in
accordance
with
the
spirit
of
the
times
and
by
no
means
exceptional
if
the
stern
and
imposing
personality
of
the
great
emperor
could
not
win
obedience
the
task
was
hopeless
for
weaker
rulers
most
monarchs
were
driven
into
the
use
of
another
description
of
troops
inferior
in
to
the
feudal
force
but
more
amenable
to
discipline
the
mercenary
comes
to
the
fore
in
the
second
half
of
the
twelfth
century
a
stranger
to
all
the
nobler
incentives
to
valour
an
enemy
to
his
god
and
his
neighbour
the
most
deservedly
hated
man
in
europe
he
was
yet
the
instrument
which
kings
even
those
of
the
better
sort
were
obliged
to
seek
out
and
cherish
when
wars
ceased
to
be
mere
frontier
raids
and
were
carried
on
for
long
periods
at
a
great
distance
from
the
homes
of
most
of
the
baronage
it
became
impossible
to
rely
on
the
services
of
the
feudal
levy
but
how
to
provide
the
large
sums
necessary
for
the
payment
of
mercenaries
was
not
always
obvious
notable
among
the
expedients
employed
was
that
of
henry
ii
of
england
who
substituted
for
the
personal
service
of
each
knight
the
system
of
by
this
the
majority
of
the
tenants
of
the
crown
compounded
for
their
personal
service
by
paying
two
marks
for
each
knight
s
fee
thus
the
king
was
enabled
to
pass
the
seas
at
the
head
of
a
force
of
mercenaries
who
were
for
most
military
purposes
infinitely
preferable
to
the
feudal
array
however
objectionable
the
hired
foreigner
might
be
on
the
score
of
his
greed
and
ferocity
he
could
at
least
be
trusted
to
stand
by
his
colours
as
long
as
he
was
regularly
paid
every
ruler
found
him
a
necessity
in
time
of
war
but
to
the
unconstitutional
and
oppressive
ruler
his
existence
was
especially
profitable
it
was
solely
by
the
lavish
use
of
mercenaries
that
the
warlike
nobility
could
be
held
in
check
despotism
could
only
begin
when
the
monarch
became
able
to
surround
himself
with
a
strong
force
of
men
whose
desires
and
feelings
were
alien
to
those
of
the
nation
the
tyrant
in
modern
europe
as
in
ancient
greece
found
his
natural
support
in
foreign
hired
soldiery
king
john
when
he
drew
to
himself
his
routiers
brabançons
and
satellites
was
unconsciously
imitating
pisistratus
and
polycrates
the
military
efficiency
of
the
mercenary
of
the
thirteenth
century
was
however
only
a
development
of
that
of
the
ordinary
feudal
cavalier
like
the
latter
he
was
a
horseman
his
rise
did
not
bring
with
it
any
radical
change
in
the
methods
of
war
though
he
was
a
more
practised
warrior
he
still
worked
on
the
old
system
or
want
of
system
which
characterised
the
cavalry
tactics
of
the
time
the
final
stage
in
the
history
of
mercenary
troops
was
reached
when
the
bands
which
had
served
through
a
long
war
instead
of
dispersing
at
its
conclusion
held
together
and
moved
across
the
continent
in
search
of
a
state
which
might
be
willing
to
buy
their
services
but
the
age
of
the
great
company
and
the
italian
condottieri
lies
rather
in
the
fourteenth
than
the
thirteenth
century
and
its
discussion
must
be
deferred
to
another
chapter
in
the
whole
military
history
of
the
period
the
most
striking
feature
is
undoubtedly
the
importance
of
fortified
places
and
the
ascendancy
assumed
by
the
defensive
in
poliorcetics
if
battles
were
few
sieges
were
numerous
and
abnormally
lengthy
the
castle
was
as
integral
a
part
of
feudal
organization
as
the
mailed
knight
and
just
as
the
noble
continued
to
heap
defence
after
defence
on
to
the
persons
of
himself
and
his
charger
so
he
continued
to
surround
his
dwelling
with
more
and
more
fortifications
the
simple
norman
castle
of
the
eleventh
century
with
its
great
keep
and
plain
rectangular
enclosure
developed
into
elaborate
systems
of
concentric
works
like
those
of
caerphilly
and
carnarvon
the
walls
of
the
town
rivalled
those
of
the
citadel
and
every
country
bristled
with
forts
and
places
of
strength
large
and
small
the
one
particular
in
which
real
military
capacity
is
displayed
in
the
period
is
the
choice
of
commanding
sites
for
fortresses
a
single
stronghold
was
often
so
well
placed
that
it
served
as
the
key
to
an
entire
district
the
best
claim
to
the
possession
of
a
general
s
eye
which
can
be
made
in
behalf
of
richard
rests
on
the
fact
that
he
chose
the
position
for
château
gaillard
the
great
castle
which
sufficed
to
protect
the
whole
of
eastern
normandy
as
long
as
it
was
adequately
held
the
strength
of
a
mediæval
fortress
lay
in
the
extraordinary
solidity
of
its
construction
against
walls
fifteen
to
thirty
feet
thick
the
feeble
of
the
day
perriéres
catapults
trebuchets
and
so
forth
beat
without
perceptible
effect
a
norman
keep
solid
and
tall
with
no
to
be
set
on
fire
and
no
openings
near
the
ground
to
be
battered
in
had
an
almost
endless
capacity
for
passive
resistance
even
a
weak
garrison
could
hold
out
as
long
as
its
provisions
lasted
mining
was
perhaps
the
device
which
had
most
hope
of
success
against
such
a
stronghold
but
if
the
castle
was
provided
with
a
deep
moat
or
was
built
directly
on
a
rock
mining
was
of
no
avail
there
remained
the
laborious
expedient
of
demolishing
the
lower
parts
of
the
walls
by
approaches
made
under
cover
of
a
or
cat
as
it
was
called
if
the
moat
could
be
filled
and
the
cat
brought
close
to
the
foot
of
the
fortifications
this
method
might
be
of
some
use
against
a
fortress
of
the
simple
norman
type
before
bastions
were
invented
there
was
no
means
by
which
the
missiles
of
the
besieged
could
adequately
command
the
ground
immediately
below
the
ramparts
if
the
defenders
showed
themselves
over
the
walls
as
would
be
necessary
in
order
to
reach
men
perpendicularly
below
them
they
were
at
once
exposed
to
the
archers
and
who
under
cover
of
mantlets
protected
the
working
of
the
besieger
s
pioneers
hence
something
might
be
done
by
the
method
of
demolishing
the
lower
parts
of
the
walls
but
the
process
was
always
slow
laborious
and
exceedingly
costly
in
the
matter
of
human
lives
unless
pressed
for
time
a
good
commander
would
almost
invariably
prefer
to
starve
out
a
garrison
the
success
however
partial
and
hardly
won
of
this
form
of
attack
led
to
several
developments
on
the
part
of
the
defence
the
moat
was
sometimes
strengthened
with
palisading
occasionally
small
detached
forts
were
constructed
just
outside
the
walls
on
any
favourable
spot
but
the
most
generally
used
expedients
were
the
brattice
and
the
construction
of
large
towers
projecting
from
the
wall
and
flanking
the
long
sketches
of
curtain
which
had
been
found
the
weak
point
in
the
norman
system
of
fortification
the
brattice
was
a
wooden
gallery
fitted
with
apertures
in
its
floor
and
running
along
the
top
of
the
wall
from
which
it
projected
several
feet
it
was
supported
by
beams
built
out
from
the
rampart
and
commanded
by
means
of
its
apertures
the
ground
immediately
at
the
foot
of
the
walls
thus
the
besieger
could
no
longer
get
out
of
the
range
of
the
missiles
of
the
besieged
and
continued
exposed
to
them
however
close
he
drew
to
the
fortifications
the
objection
to
the
brattice
was
that
being
wooden
it
could
be
set
on
fire
by
inflammatory
substances
projected
by
the
catapults
of
the
besieger
it
was
therefore
superseded
ere
long
by
the
use
of
machicolation
where
a
projecting
stone
gallery
replaced
the
woodwork
far
more
important
was
the
utilization
of
the
flanking
action
of
towers
the
other
great
improvement
made
by
the
defence
this
rendered
it
possible
to
direct
a
converging
fire
from
the
sides
on
the
point
selected
for
attack
by
the
besieger
the
towers
also
served
to
cut
off
a
captured
stretch
of
wall
from
any
communication
with
the
rest
of
the
fortifications
by
closing
the
doors
in
the
two
on
each
side
of
the
breach
the
enemy
was
left
isolated
on
the
piece
of
wall
he
had
won
and
could
not
push
to
right
or
left
without
storming
a
tower
this
development
of
the
defensive
again
reduced
the
offensive
to
impotence
starvation
was
the
only
weapon
likely
to
reduce
a
place
and
fortresses
were
therefore
blockaded
rather
than
attacked
the
besieger
having
built
a
line
of
circumvallation
and
an
intrenched
camp
sat
down
to
wait
for
hunger
to
do
its
work
it
will
be
observed
that
by
fortifying
his
position
he
gave
himself
the
advantage
of
the
defensive
in
repelling
attacks
of
relieving
armies
his
other
expedients
such
as
endeavours
to
fire
the
internal
buildings
of
the
invested
place
to
cut
off
its
water
supply
or
to
carry
it
by
nocturnal
escalade
were
seldom
of
much
avail
the
number
and
strength
of
the
fortified
places
of
western
europe
explain
the
apparent
futility
of
many
campaigns
of
the
period
a
land
could
not
be
conquered
with
rapidity
when
every
district
was
guarded
by
three
or
four
castles
and
walled
towns
which
would
each
need
several
months
siege
before
they
could
be
reduced
campaigns
tended
to
become
either
plundering
raids
which
left
the
strongholds
alone
or
to
be
occupied
in
the
prolonged
blockade
of
a
single
fortified
place
the
invention
of
gunpowder
was
the
first
advantage
thrown
on
the
side
of
the
attack
for
three
centuries
even
cannon
however
were
at
the
period
of
their
invention
and
for
long
years
afterward
of
very
little
practical
importance
the
taking
of
constantinople
by
mahomet
ii
is
perhaps
the
first
event
of
european
importance
in
which
the
power
of
artillery
played
the
leading
part
before
proceeding
to
discuss
the
rise
of
the
new
forms
of
military
efficiency
which
brought
about
the
end
of
the
supremacy
of
feudal
cavalry
it
may
be
well
to
cast
a
glance
at
those
curious
military
episodes
the
crusades
considering
their
extraordinary
and
abnormal
nature
more
results
might
have
been
expected
to
follow
them
than
can
in
fact
be
traced
when
opposed
by
a
system
of
tactics
to
which
they
were
unaccustomed
the
western
nobles
were
invariably
disconcerted
at
fights
such
as
dorylæum
they
were
only
preserved
from
disaster
by
their
indomitable
energy
tactically
beaten
they
extricated
themselves
by
sheer
hard
fighting
on
fields
such
as
that
of
antioch
they
asserted
the
same
superiority
over
oriental
horsemen
which
the
byzantine
had
previously
enjoyed
but
after
a
short
experience
of
western
tactics
the
turks
and
saracens
foreswore
the
battlefield
they
normally
acted
in
great
bodies
of
light
cavalry
moving
rapidly
from
point
to
point
and
cutting
off
convoys
or
attacking
detached
parties
the
crusaders
were
seldom
indulged
in
the
twelfth
century
with
those
pitched
battles
for
which
they
craved
the
mahometan
leaders
would
only
fight
when
they
had
placed
all
the
advantages
on
their
own
side
normally
they
declined
the
contest
in
the
east
just
as
in
europe
the
war
was
one
of
sieges
armies
numbered
by
the
hundred
thousand
were
arrested
before
the
walls
of
a
fortress
such
as
acre
and
in
despair
at
reducing
it
by
their
operations
had
to
resort
to
the
lengthy
process
of
starving
out
the
garrison
on
the
other
hand
nothing
but
the
ascendancy
enjoyed
by
the
defensive
could
have
protracted
the
existence
of
the
kingdom
of
jerusalem
when
it
had
sunk
to
a
chain
of
isolated
fortresses
dotting
the
shore
of
the
levant
from
alexandretta
to
acre
and
jaffa
if
we
can
point
to
any
modifications
introduced
into
european
warfare
by
the
eastern
experience
of
the
crusaders
they
are
not
of
any
great
importance
greek
fire
if
its
composition
was
really
ascertained
would
seem
to
have
had
very
little
use
in
the
west
the
copied
from
the
cavalry
of
the
turkish
and
mameluke
sultans
did
not
prove
a
great
military
success
the
adoption
of
the
curved
sabre
the
the
horseman
s
mace
and
a
few
other
weapons
is
hardly
worth
mentioning
on
the
whole
the
military
results
of
the
crusades
were
curiously
small
as
lessons
they
were
wholly
disregarded
by
the
european
world
when
after
the
interval
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
a
western
army
once
more
faced
an
oriental
foe
it
committed
at
nicopolis
exactly
the
same
blunder
which
led
to
the
loss
of
the
day
at
mansoura
the
swiss
from
the
battle
of
morgarten
to
the
battle
of
marignano
character
arms
and
in
the
fourteenth
century
infantry
after
a
thousand
years
of
depression
and
neglect
at
last
regained
its
due
share
of
military
importance
almost
simultaneously
there
appeared
two
peoples
asserting
a
mastery
in
european
politics
by
the
efficiency
of
their
their
manners
of
fighting
were
as
different
as
their
national
character
and
geographical
position
but
although
they
never
met
either
in
peace
or
war
they
were
practically
allied
for
the
destruction
of
feudal
chivalry
the
knight
who
had
for
so
long
ridden
roughshod
over
the
populations
of
europe
was
now
to
recognize
his
masters
in
the
art
of
war
the
free
yeomanry
of
england
and
the
free
herdsmen
of
the
alps
were
about
to
enter
on
their
career
of
conquest
when
war
is
reduced
to
its
simplest
elements
we
find
that
there
are
only
two
ways
in
which
an
enemy
can
be
met
and
defeated
either
the
shock
or
the
missile
must
be
employed
against
him
in
the
one
case
the
victor
achieves
success
by
throwing
himself
on
his
opponent
and
worsting
him
in
a
struggle
by
his
numbers
his
weight
the
superiority
of
his
arms
or
the
greater
strength
and
skill
with
which
he
wields
them
in
the
second
case
he
wins
the
day
by
keeping
up
such
a
constant
and
deadly
rain
of
missiles
that
his
enemy
is
destroyed
or
driven
back
before
he
can
come
to
close
quarters
each
of
these
methods
can
be
combined
with
the
use
of
very
different
arms
and
tactics
and
is
susceptible
of
innumerable
variations
in
the
course
of
history
they
have
alternately
asserted
their
preponderance
in
the
early
middle
ages
were
entirely
in
the
ascendant
while
in
our
own
day
the
use
of
the
missile
has
driven
the
rival
system
out
of
the
field
nor
does
it
appear
possible
that
this
final
verdict
can
ever
be
reversed
the
english
archer
and
the
swiss
pikeman
represented
these
two
great
forms
of
military
efficiency
in
their
simplest
and
most
elementary
shapes
the
one
relied
on
his
power
to
defeat
his
enemy
s
attack
by
rapid
and
accurate
shooting
the
other
was
capable
of
driving
before
him
far
superior
numbers
by
the
irresistible
impact
and
steady
pressure
of
his
solid
column
with
its
serried
hedge
of
when
tried
against
the
cavalry
which
had
previously
held
the
ascendancy
in
europe
each
of
these
methods
was
found
adequate
to
secure
the
victory
for
those
who
employed
it
hence
the
whole
military
system
of
the
middle
ages
received
a
profound
modification
to
the
unquestioned
predominance
of
a
single
form
that
of
the
charge
delivered
by
cavalry
succeeded
a
rapid
alternation
of
successful
and
unsuccessful
experiments
in
the
correlation
and
combination
of
cavalry
and
infantry
of
and
further
complicated
by
the
results
of
the
introduction
of
firearms
this
struggle
has
been
prolonged
down
to
the
present
day
it
is
only
in
the
last
few
years
that
the
military
world
has
learnt
that
the
attempt
to
utilize
the
shock
of
the
infantry
column
or
the
charging
squadron
must
be
abandoned
in
face
of
the
extraordinary
development
of
modern
firearms
the
swiss
of
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
have
been
compared
with
much
aptness
to
the
romans
of
the
early
republic
in
the
swiss
as
in
the
roman
character
we
find
the
most
intense
patriotism
combined
with
an
utter
want
of
moral
sense
and
a
certain
meanness
and
pettiness
of
conception
which
prevent
us
from
calling
either
nation
truly
great
in
both
the
steadiest
courage
and
the
fervour
of
the
noblest
were
allied
to
an
appalling
ferocity
and
a
cynical
contempt
and
pitiless
disregard
for
the
rights
of
others
among
each
people
the
warlike
pride
generated
by
successful
wars
of
independence
led
ere
long
to
wars
of
conquest
and
plunder
as
neighbours
both
were
rendered
insufferable
by
their
haughtiness
and
proneness
to
take
offence
on
the
slightest
provocation
as
enemies
both
were
distinguished
for
their
deliberate
and
cruelty
the
resolution
to
give
no
quarter
which
appears
almost
pardonable
in
patriots
desperately
defending
their
native
soil
becomes
brutal
when
retained
in
wars
of
aggression
but
reaches
the
climax
of
fiendish
inhumanity
when
the
slayer
is
a
mere
mercenary
fighting
for
a
cause
in
which
he
has
no
national
interest
repulsive
as
was
the
bloodthirstiness
of
the
roman
it
was
far
from
equalling
in
moral
guilt
the
needless
ferocity
displayed
by
the
hired
swiss
soldiery
on
many
a
battlefield
of
the
sixteenth
century
in
no
point
do
we
find
a
greater
resemblance
between
the
histories
of
the
two
peoples
than
in
the
causes
of
their
success
in
war
rome
and
switzerland
alike
are
examples
of
the
fact
that
a
good
military
organization
and
a
sound
system
of
national
tactics
are
the
surest
basis
for
a
sustained
career
of
conquest
provided
with
these
a
vigorous
state
needs
no
unbroken
series
of
great
commanders
a
succession
of
respectable
mediocrities
suffices
to
guide
the
great
engine
of
war
which
works
almost
automatically
and
seldom
fails
to
cleave
its
way
to
success
the
elected
consuls
of
rome
the
elected
or
nominated
captains
of
the
confederates
could
never
have
led
their
troops
to
victory
had
it
not
been
for
the
systems
which
the
experience
of
their
predecessors
had
brought
to
perfection
the
combination
of
pliability
and
solid
strength
in
the
legion
the
powers
of
rapid
movement
and
irresistible
impact
which
met
in
the
swiss
column
were
competent
to
win
a
field
without
the
exertion
of
any
extraordinary
ability
by
the
generals
who
set
them
in
motion
the
which
the
confederates
invariably
employed
was
one
whose
prototype
had
been
seen
in
the
macedonian
phalanx
it
was
always
in
masses
of
enormous
depth
that
they
presented
themselves
on
the
battlefield
their
great
national
weapon
in
the
days
of
their
highest
reputation
was
the
pike
an
ashen
shaft
eighteen
feet
long
fitted
with
a
head
of
steel
which
added
another
foot
to
its
length
it
was
grasped
with
two
hands
widely
extended
and
poised
at
the
level
of
the
shoulder
with
the
point
slightly
sunk
so
as
to
deliver
a
downward
thrust
before
the
line
projected
not
only
the
pikes
of
the
front
rank
but
those
of
the
second
third
and
fourth
an
impenetrable
hedge
of
bristling
points
the
men
in
the
interior
of
the
column
held
their
weapons
upright
till
called
upon
to
step
forward
in
order
to
replace
those
who
had
fallen
in
the
foremost
ranks
thus
the
pikes
rising
twelve
feet
above
the
heads
of
the
men
who
bore
them
gave
to
the
charging
mass
the
appearance
of
a
moving
wood
above
it
floated
numberless
flags
the
pennons
of
districts
towns
and
guilds
the
banners
of
the
cantons
sometimes
the
great
standard
of
the
ancient
league
of
high
germany
the
white
cross
on
the
red
ground
the
pike
however
was
not
the
only
weapon
of
the
swiss
in
the
earlier
days
of
their
independence
when
the
confederacy
consisted
of
three
or
four
cantons
the
halberd
was
their
favourite
arm
and
even
in
the
sixteenth
century
a
considerable
proportion
of
the
army
continued
to
employ
it
eight
feet
in
length
with
a
heavy
head
which
ended
in
a
sharp
point
and
bore
on
its
front
a
blade
like
that
of
a
hatchet
on
its
back
a
strong
hook
the
halberd
was
the
most
murderous
if
also
the
most
ponderous
of
weapons
swung
by
the
strong
arms
of
the
alpine
herdsmen
it
would
cleave
helmet
shield
or
like
pasteboard
the
sight
of
the
ghastly
wounds
which
it
inflicted
might
well
appal
the
stoutest
foeman
he
who
had
once
felt
its
edge
required
no
second
stroke
it
was
the
halberd
which
laid
leopold
of
hapsburg
dead
across
his
fallen
banner
at
sempach
and
struck
down
charles
of
burgundy
all
his
face
one
gash
from
temple
to
teeth
in
the
frozen
ditch
by
nancy
the
halberdiers
had
their
recognized
station
in
the
confederates
they
were
drawn
up
in
the
centre
of
the
column
around
the
chief
banner
which
was
placed
under
their
care
if
the
enemy
succeeded
in
checking
the
onset
of
the
pikemen
it
was
their
duty
to
pass
between
the
front
ranks
which
opened
out
to
give
them
egress
and
throw
themselves
into
the
fray
they
were
joined
in
their
charge
by
the
bearers
of
swords
and
lucern
hammers
all
weapons
of
the
most
fearful
efficiency
in
a
combat
it
was
seldom
that
a
hostile
force
whether
infantry
or
cavalry
sustained
this
final
attack
when
the
infuriated
swiss
dashed
in
among
them
slashing
right
and
left
sweeping
off
the
legs
of
horses
and
cleaving
armour
and
flesh
with
the
same
tremendous
blow
in
repelling
cavalry
charges
however
the
halberd
was
found
owing
to
its
shortness
a
far
less
useful
weapon
than
the
pike
the
disastrous
fight
near
bellinzona
in
where
the
swiss
having
a
large
proportion
of
halberdiers
in
their
front
rank
were
broken
by
the
milanese
gendarmes
was
the
final
cause
of
its
relegation
to
the
second
epoch
of
the
battle
from
the
first
shock
of
the
opposing
forces
it
was
banished
being
reserved
for
the
which
afterwards
ensued
next
to
its
solidity
the
most
formidable
quality
of
the
swiss
infantry
was
its
rapidity
of
movement
no
troops
were
ever
more
expeditious
on
a
march
or
in
forming
themselves
for
battle
because
they
were
not
overloaded
with
armour
when
emergencies
arrived
a
confederate
army
could
be
raised
with
extraordinary
speed
a
people
who
regarded
military
glory
as
the
one
thing
which
made
life
worth
living
flocked
to
arms
without
needing
a
second
summons
the
outlying
contingents
marched
day
and
night
in
order
to
reach
the
mustering
place
in
good
time
there
was
no
need
to
waste
days
in
the
weary
work
of
organization
when
every
man
stood
among
his
kinsmen
and
neighbours
beneath
the
pennon
of
his
native
town
or
valley
the
troops
of
the
democratic
cantons
elected
their
officers
those
of
the
larger
states
received
leaders
appointed
by
their
councils
and
then
without
further
delay
the
army
marched
to
meet
the
enemy
thus
an
invader
however
unexpected
his
attack
might
in
the
course
of
three
or
four
days
find
twenty
thousand
men
on
his
hands
they
would
often
be
within
a
few
miles
of
him
before
he
had
heard
that
a
swiss
force
was
in
the
field
in
face
of
such
an
army
it
was
impossible
for
the
troops
of
the
fourteenth
or
fifteenth
centuries
to
execute
manœuvres
an
attempt
to
alter
the
line
of
battle
as
charles
the
rash
discovered
to
his
dismay
at
granson
was
sure
to
lead
to
disaster
when
once
the
confederates
were
in
motion
their
enemy
had
to
resign
himself
to
fighting
in
whatever
order
he
found
himself
at
the
moment
they
always
made
it
their
rule
to
begin
the
fight
and
never
to
allow
themselves
to
be
attacked
the
composition
of
their
various
columns
was
settled
early
on
the
battle
morning
and
the
men
moved
off
to
the
field
already
drawn
up
in
their
there
was
no
pause
needed
to
draw
the
army
out
in
line
of
battle
each
phalanx
marched
on
the
enemy
at
a
steady
but
swift
pace
which
covered
the
ground
in
an
incredibly
short
time
the
solid
masses
glided
forward
in
perfect
order
and
in
deep
silence
until
the
burst
out
in
one
simultaneous
roar
and
the
column
dashed
itself
against
the
hostile
front
the
rapidity
of
the
swiss
advance
had
in
it
something
portentous
the
great
wood
of
pikes
and
halberds
came
rolling
over
the
brow
of
some
neighbouring
hill
a
moment
later
it
was
pursuing
its
even
way
towards
the
front
and
then
almost
before
the
opponent
had
time
to
realize
his
position
it
was
upon
him
with
its
four
rows
of
projecting
in
front
and
the
impetus
of
file
upon
file
surging
up
from
the
rear
this
power
of
swift
movement
was
as
macchiavelli
observed
the
result
of
the
confederates
determination
not
to
burden
themselves
with
heavy
armour
their
abstention
from
its
use
was
originally
due
to
their
poverty
alone
but
was
confirmed
by
the
discovery
that
a
heavy
panoply
would
clog
and
hamper
the
efficiency
of
their
national
tactics
the
normal
equipment
of
the
pikeman
or
halberdier
was
therefore
light
consisting
of
a
and
breastplate
alone
even
these
were
not
in
universal
employment
many
of
the
soldiery
trusted
the
defence
of
their
persons
to
their
weapons
and
wore
only
felt
hats
and
leather
jerkins
the
use
of
and
greaves
was
by
no
means
common
indeed
the
men
wearing
them
were
often
not
sufficient
in
number
to
form
a
single
rank
at
the
head
of
the
column
the
post
in
which
they
were
always
placed
the
leaders
alone
were
required
to
present
themselves
in
full
armour
they
were
therefore
obliged
to
ride
while
on
the
march
in
order
to
keep
up
with
their
followers
when
they
arrived
in
sight
of
the
enemy
they
dismounted
and
led
their
men
to
the
charge
on
foot
a
few
of
the
patricians
and
men
of
knightly
family
from
bern
were
found
in
the
fifteenth
century
serving
as
cavalry
but
their
numbers
were
absolutely
insignificant
a
few
scores
at
the
most
although
the
strength
and
pride
of
the
confederates
lay
in
their
pikemen
and
halberdiers
the
light
troops
were
by
no
means
neglected
on
occasion
they
were
known
to
form
as
much
as
a
fourth
of
the
army
and
they
never
sank
below
a
tenth
of
the
whole
number
they
were
originally
armed
with
the
the
weapon
of
the
fabulous
tell
but
even
before
the
great
burgundian
war
the
use
of
the
clumsy
firearms
of
the
day
was
general
among
them
it
was
their
duty
to
precede
the
main
body
and
to
endeavour
to
draw
on
themselves
the
attention
of
the
enemy
s
artillery
and
light
troops
so
that
the
columns
behind
them
might
advance
as
far
as
possible
without
being
molested
thus
the
true
use
of
a
line
of
skirmishers
was
already
appreciated
among
the
swiss
in
the
fifteenth
century
when
the
pikemen
had
come
up
with
them
they
retired
into
the
intervals
between
the
various
masses
and
took
no
part
in
the
great
charge
for
which
their
weapons
were
not
adapted
it
is
at
once
evident
that
in
the
simplicity
of
its
component
elements
lay
one
of
the
chief
sources
of
the
strength
of
a
confederate
army
its
commanders
were
not
troubled
by
any
of
those
problems
as
to
the
correlation
and
subordination
of
the
various
arms
which
led
to
so
many
unhappy
experiments
among
the
generals
of
other
nations
cavalry
and
artillery
were
practically
nor
were
the
operations
hampered
by
the
necessity
of
finding
some
employment
for
those
masses
of
troops
of
inferior
quality
who
so
often
increased
the
numbers
but
not
the
efficiency
of
a
mediæval
army
a
swiss
force
however
hastily
gathered
was
always
homogeneous
and
coherent
there
was
no
residuum
of
untried
or
disloyal
soldiery
for
whose
conduct
special
precautions
would
have
to
be
taken
the
larger
proportion
of
the
men
among
a
nation
devoted
to
war
had
seen
a
considerable
amount
of
service
while
if
local
jealousies
were
ever
remembered
in
the
field
they
only
served
to
spur
the
rival
contingents
on
to
a
healthy
emulation
in
valour
however
much
the
cantons
might
wrangle
among
themselves
they
were
always
found
united
against
a
foreign
attack
and
the
character
and
organization
of
the
confederate
army
were
exceedingly
unfavourable
to
the
rise
of
great
generals
the
soldier
rested
his
hope
of
success
rather
on
an
entire
confidence
in
the
fighting
power
of
himself
and
his
comrades
than
on
the
skill
of
his
commander
troops
who
have
proved
in
a
hundred
fields
their
ability
to
bear
up
against
the
most
overwhelming
odds
are
comparatively
indifferent
as
to
the
personality
of
their
leader
if
he
is
competent
they
work
out
his
plan
with
success
if
not
they
cheerfully
set
themselves
to
repair
his
faults
by
sheer
hard
fighting
another
consideration
was
even
more
important
among
the
swiss
there
was
a
universal
prejudice
felt
against
placing
the
troops
of
one
canton
under
the
orders
of
the
citizen
of
another
so
strong
was
this
feeling
that
an
extraordinary
result
ensued
the
appointment
of
a
remained
throughout
the
brilliant
period
of
swiss
history
an
exception
rather
than
a
rule
neither
in
the
time
of
sempach
in
the
old
war
of
zurich
in
the
great
struggle
with
burgundy
nor
in
the
swabian
campaign
against
maximilian
of
austria
was
any
single
general
entrusted
with
supreme
authority
the
conduct
of
affairs
was
in
the
hands
of
a
council
of
war
but
it
was
a
council
which
contrary
to
the
old
proverb
about
such
bodies
was
always
ready
and
willing
to
fight
it
was
composed
of
the
captains
of
each
cantonal
contingent
and
settled
the
questions
which
came
under
discussion
by
a
simple
majority
of
voices
before
a
battle
it
entrusted
the
command
of
van
rear
and
light
troops
to
different
officers
but
the
holders
of
such
posts
enjoyed
a
mere
delegated
authority
which
expired
with
the
cessation
of
the
emergency
the
existence
of
this
curious
subdivision
of
power
to
which
the
nearest
parallel
would
be
found
in
early
byzantine
days
would
suffice
by
itself
to
explain
the
lack
of
all
strategical
skill
and
unity
of
purpose
which
was
observable
in
swiss
warfare
the
compromise
which
forms
the
mean
between
several
rival
schemes
usually
combines
their
faults
not
their
merits
but
in
addition
to
this
we
may
suspect
that
to
find
any
one
swiss
officer
capable
of
working
out
a
coherent
plan
of
campaign
would
have
been
difficult
the
captain
was
an
old
soldier
who
had
won
distinction
on
bygone
battlefields
but
except
in
his
experience
nowise
different
to
the
men
under
his
orders
of
elaborating
the
more
difficult
strategical
combinations
a
swiss
council
of
war
was
not
much
more
capable
than
an
average
party
of
veteran
would
be
in
our
own
day
with
tactics
however
the
case
was
different
the
best
means
of
adapting
the
attack
in
column
to
the
accidents
of
locality
or
the
quality
and
armament
of
the
opposing
troops
were
studied
in
the
school
of
experience
a
real
tactical
system
was
developed
whose
efficiency
was
proved
again
and
again
in
the
battles
of
the
fifteenth
century
for
dealing
with
the
mediæval
and
infantry
against
whom
it
had
been
designed
the
swiss
method
was
unrivalled
it
was
only
when
a
new
age
introduced
different
conditions
into
war
that
it
gradually
became
obsolete
the
normal
order
of
battle
employed
by
the
confederates
however
small
or
large
their
army
might
be
was
an
advance
in
an
échelon
of
three
divisions
the
first
corps
vorhut
that
which
had
formed
the
van
while
the
force
was
on
the
march
made
for
a
given
point
in
the
enemy
s
line
the
second
corps
gewaltshaufen
instead
of
coming
up
in
line
with
the
first
advanced
parallel
to
it
but
at
a
short
distance
to
its
right
or
left
rear
the
third
corps
nachhut
advanced
still
further
back
and
often
halted
until
the
effect
of
the
first
attack
was
seen
in
order
that
it
might
be
able
to
act
if
necessary
as
a
reserve
this
disposition
left
a
clear
space
behind
each
column
so
that
if
it
was
repulsed
it
could
retire
without
throwing
into
disorder
the
rest
of
the
army
other
nations
the
french
at
agincourt
who
were
in
the
habit
of
placing
one
corps
directly
in
front
of
another
had
often
to
pay
the
penalty
for
their
tactical
crime
by
seeing
the
defeat
of
their
first
line
entail
the
rout
of
the
whole
army
each
division
being
rolled
back
in
confusion
on
that
immediately
in
its
rear
the
swiss
order
of
attack
had
another
strong
point
in
rendering
it
almost
impossible
for
the
enemy
s
troops
to
wheel
inwards
and
attack
the
most
advanced
column
if
they
did
so
they
at
once
exposed
their
own
flank
to
the
second
column
which
was
just
coming
up
and
commencing
its
charge
the
advance
in
échelon
of
columns
was
not
the
only
form
employed
by
the
confederates
at
laupen
the
centre
or
gewaltshaufen
moved
forward
and
opened
the
fight
before
the
wings
were
engaged
at
the
combat
of
frastenz
in
on
the
other
hand
the
wings
commenced
the
onset
while
the
centre
was
refused
and
only
came
up
to
complete
the
overthrow
even
the
traditional
array
in
three
masses
was
sometimes
discarded
for
a
different
formation
at
sempach
the
men
of
the
forest
cantons
were
drawn
up
in
a
single
wedge
keil
this
order
was
not
as
might
be
expected
from
its
name
triangular
but
merely
a
column
of
more
than
ordinary
depth
in
proportion
to
its
frontage
its
object
was
to
break
a
hostile
line
of
unusual
firmness
by
a
concentrated
shock
delivered
against
its
centre
in
during
the
fighting
which
preceded
the
siege
of
waldshut
the
whole
confederate
army
moved
out
to
meet
the
austrian
cavalry
in
a
great
hollow
square
in
the
midst
of
which
were
placed
the
banners
with
their
escort
of
halberdiers
when
such
a
body
was
attacked
the
men
faced
outwards
to
receive
the
onset
of
the
horsemen
this
they
called
forming
the
hedgehog
so
steady
were
they
that
with
very
inferior
numbers
they
could
face
the
most
energetic
charge
in
the
swabian
war
of
six
hundred
men
of
zurich
caught
in
the
open
plain
by
a
thousand
imperial
formed
a
hedgehog
and
drove
off
the
enemy
with
ease
and
much
jesting
macchiavelli
speaks
of
another
swiss
order
of
battle
which
he
calls
the
cross
between
the
arms
of
which
they
place
their
musketeers
to
shelter
them
from
the
first
shock
of
the
hostile
his
description
however
is
anything
but
explicit
and
we
can
find
no
trace
of
any
formation
of
the
kind
in
any
recorded
engagement
of
swiss
military
the
first
victory
of
the
confederates
was
won
not
by
the
tactics
which
afterwards
rendered
them
famous
but
by
a
judicious
choice
of
a
battlefield
morgarten
was
a
fearful
example
of
the
normal
uselessness
of
feudal
cavalry
in
a
mountainous
country
on
a
frosty
november
day
when
the
roads
were
like
ice
underfoot
leopold
of
austria
thrust
his
long
narrow
column
into
the
defiles
leading
to
the
valley
of
schwytz
in
front
rode
the
knights
who
had
of
course
claimed
the
honour
of
opening
the
contest
while
the
infantry
blocked
the
way
behind
in
the
narrow
pass
of
morgarten
where
the
road
passes
between
a
precipitous
slope
on
the
right
and
the
waters
of
the
egeri
lake
on
the
left
the
confederates
awaited
the
austrians
full
of
the
carelessness
which
accompanies
overweening
arrogance
the
duke
had
neglected
the
most
ordinary
precaution
of
exploring
his
road
and
only
discovered
the
vicinity
of
the
enemy
when
a
shower
of
boulders
and
came
rolling
down
the
slope
on
his
right
flank
where
a
party
of
swiss
were
posted
in
a
position
entirely
inaccessible
to
horsemen
a
moment
later
the
head
of
the
helpless
column
was
charged
by
the
main
body
of
the
mountaineers
before
the
austrians
had
realized
that
the
battle
had
commenced
the
halberds
and
of
the
confederates
were
working
havoc
in
their
van
the
front
ranks
of
the
knights
wedged
so
tightly
together
by
the
impact
of
the
enemy
that
they
could
not
lay
their
lances
in
rest
much
less
spur
their
horses
to
the
charge
fought
and
died
the
centre
and
rear
were
compelled
to
halt
and
stand
motionless
unable
to
push
forward
on
account
of
the
narrowness
of
the
pass
or
to
retreat
on
account
of
the
infantry
who
choked
the
road
behind
for
a
short
time
they
endured
the
deadly
shower
of
rocks
and
logs
which
continued
to
bound
down
the
slope
tear
through
the
crowded
ranks
and
hurl
man
and
horse
into
the
lake
below
then
by
a
simultaneous
impulse
the
greater
part
of
the
mass
turned
their
reins
and
made
for
the
rear
in
the
press
hundreds
were
pushed
over
the
edge
of
the
road
to
drown
in
the
deep
water
on
the
left
the
main
body
burst
into
the
column
of
their
own
infantry
and
trampling
down
their
unfortunate
followers
fled
with
such
speed
as
was
possible
on
the
slippery
path
the
swiss
having
now
exterminated
the
few
knights
in
the
van
who
had
remained
to
fight
came
down
on
the
rear
of
the
crowd
and
cut
down
horseman
and
footman
alike
without
meeting
any
resistance
it
was
not
a
battle
says
john
of
winterthur
a
contemporary
chronicler
but
a
mere
butchery
of
duke
leopold
s
men
for
the
mountain
folk
slew
them
like
sheep
in
the
shambles
no
one
gave
any
quarter
but
they
cut
down
all
without
distinction
till
there
were
none
left
to
kill
so
great
was
the
fierceness
of
the
confederates
that
scores
of
the
austrian
footmen
when
they
saw
the
bravest
knights
falling
helplessly
threw
themselves
in
panic
into
the
lake
preferring
to
sink
in
its
depths
rather
than
to
fall
under
the
fearful
weapons
of
their
enemies
in
short
the
swiss
won
their
freedom
because
with
instinctive
tactical
skill
they
gave
the
feudal
cavalry
no
opportunity
for
attacking
them
at
advantage
they
were
lords
of
the
field
because
it
was
they
and
not
their
foe
who
settled
where
the
fighting
should
take
on
the
steep
and
slippery
road
where
they
could
not
win
impetus
for
their
charge
and
where
the
narrowness
of
the
defile
prevented
them
from
making
use
of
their
superior
numbers
the
austrians
were
helpless
the
crushing
character
of
the
defeat
however
was
due
to
leopold
s
inexcusable
carelessness
in
leaving
the
way
unexplored
and
suffering
himself
to
be
surprised
in
the
fatal
trap
of
the
pass
morgarten
exhibits
the
swiss
military
system
in
a
rudimentary
condition
though
won
like
all
confederate
victories
by
the
charge
of
a
column
it
was
the
work
of
the
halberd
not
of
the
pike
the
latter
weapon
was
not
yet
in
general
use
among
the
mountaineers
of
the
three
cantons
it
was
in
fact
never
adopted
by
them
to
so
great
an
extent
as
was
the
case
among
the
swiss
of
the
lower
alpine
lands
and
aar
valley
the
bernese
and
people
of
zurich
and
lucern
the
halberd
murderous
though
it
might
be
was
not
an
arm
whose
possession
would
give
an
unqualified
ascendancy
to
its
wielders
it
was
the
position
not
the
weapons
nor
the
tactics
of
the
swiss
which
won
morgarten
but
their
second
great
success
bears
a
far
higher
military
importance
at
laupen
for
the
first
time
almost
since
the
days
of
the
romans
infantry
entirely
unsupported
by
horsemen
ranged
on
a
fair
field
in
the
plains
withstood
an
army
complete
in
all
arms
and
superior
in
numbers
it
was
years
after
duke
leopold
s
defeat
that
the
confederates
and
their
fellows
of
bern
met
the
forces
of
the
burgundian
nobility
of
the
valleys
of
the
aar
and
rhone
mustered
by
all
the
feudal
chiefs
between
elsass
and
lake
leman
count
gerard
of
vallangin
the
commander
of
the
baronial
army
evidently
intended
to
settle
the
day
by
turning
one
wing
of
the
enemy
and
crushing
it
with
this
object
he
drew
up
the
whole
of
his
cavalry
on
the
right
of
his
array
his
centre
and
left
being
entirely
composed
of
infantry
the
swiss
formed
the
three
columns
which
were
henceforth
to
be
their
normal
order
of
battle
they
were
under
a
single
commander
rudolf
of
erlach
to
whom
the
credit
of
having
first
employed
the
formation
apparently
belongs
the
bernese
who
were
mainly
armed
with
the
pike
formed
the
centre
column
the
wings
were
drawn
back
that
on
the
left
was
composed
of
the
men
of
the
three
old
cantons
who
were
still
employing
the
halberd
as
their
chief
weapon
while
the
right
was
made
up
of
other
allies
of
bern
in
this
order
they
moved
on
to
the
attack
the
centre
considerably
in
advance
the
infantry
of
the
barons
proved
to
be
no
match
for
the
confederates
with
a
steady
impulse
the
bernese
pushed
it
back
trampled
down
the
front
ranks
and
drove
the
rest
off
the
field
a
moment
later
the
burgundian
left
suffered
the
same
fate
at
the
hands
of
the
swiss
right
column
then
without
wasting
time
in
pursuit
the
two
victorious
masses
turned
to
aid
the
men
of
the
forest
cantons
surrounded
by
a
raging
flood
of
horsemen
on
all
sides
the
left
column
was
hard
pressed
the
halberd
though
inflicting
the
most
ghastly
wounds
could
not
prevent
the
cavalry
from
occasionally
closing
in
like
a
rock
however
the
mountaineers
withstood
the
incessant
charges
and
succeeded
in
holding
their
own
for
the
period
during
which
the
hostile
infantry
was
being
driven
off
the
field
then
the
two
successful
columns
came
down
on
the
left
and
rear
of
the
baronial
horsemen
and
steadily
met
their
charge
apparently
the
enemy
was
already
exhausted
by
his
attempt
to
overcome
the
men
of
the
forest
cantons
for
after
one
vain
attempt
to
ride
down
the
bernese
pikemen
he
turned
and
rode
off
the
field
not
without
considerable
loss
as
many
of
his
rearguard
were
intercepted
and
driven
into
the
river
sense
laupen
was
neither
so
bloody
nor
so
dramatic
a
field
as
morgarten
but
it
is
one
of
three
great
battles
which
mark
the
beginning
of
a
new
period
in
the
history
of
war
bannockburn
had
already
sounded
the
same
note
in
the
distant
west
but
for
the
continent
laupen
was
the
first
revelation
as
to
the
power
of
good
infantry
the
experiment
which
had
been
tried
a
few
years
before
at
cassel
and
with
such
ill
success
was
renewed
with
a
very
different
result
the
swiss
had
accomplished
the
feat
which
the
flemings
had
undertaken
with
inadequate
means
and
experience
seven
years
later
a
yet
more
striking
lesson
was
to
be
administered
to
feudal
chivalry
when
the
archer
faced
the
knight
at
cressy
the
horseman
was
found
unable
to
break
the
phalanx
of
pikes
unable
to
approach
the
line
from
which
the
deadly
arrow
reached
him
but
still
the
old
superstition
which
gave
the
most
honourable
name
in
war
to
the
mounted
man
was
strong
enough
to
perpetuate
for
another
century
the
cavalry
whose
day
had
really
gone
by
a
system
which
was
so
intimately
bound
up
with
mediæval
life
and
ideas
could
not
be
destroyed
by
one
or
by
twenty
disasters
sempach
the
third
great
victory
won
by
the
confederates
shares
with
the
less
famous
fight
of
arbedo
a
peculiar
interest
both
were
attempts
to
break
the
swiss
column
by
the
adoption
of
a
similar
method
of
attack
to
that
which
rendered
it
so
formidable
leopold
the
proud
remembering
no
doubt
the
powerlessness
of
the
horsemen
which
had
been
shown
at
laupen
made
his
knights
dismount
as
edward
of
england
had
done
with
such
splendid
results
thirty
years
earlier
perhaps
he
may
have
borne
in
mind
a
similar
order
given
by
his
ancestor
the
emperor
albert
when
he
fought
the
bavarians
at
hasenbühl
in
at
any
rate
the
duke
awaited
the
enemy
s
attack
with
his
mailed
formed
in
one
massive
column
their
lances
levelled
in
front
ready
to
meet
the
swiss
with
tactics
similar
to
their
own
and
with
the
advantage
which
the
superior
protection
of
armour
gave
in
a
contest
otherwise
equal
leopold
had
also
posted
in
reserve
a
considerable
body
of
foot
and
horse
who
were
to
fall
on
the
flanks
and
rear
of
the
confederates
when
they
were
fully
engaged
in
front
arrayed
in
a
single
deep
column
keil
the
swiss
came
rushing
down
from
the
hills
with
their
usual
impetuosity
the
horns
of
uri
and
unterwalden
braying
in
their
midst
and
the
banners
of
the
four
forest
cantons
waving
above
them
the
first
shock
between
the
two
masses
was
tremendous
but
when
it
was
ended
the
confederates
found
themselves
thrust
back
their
whole
front
rank
had
gone
down
and
the
austrian
column
was
unshaken
in
a
moment
they
rallied
uri
replaced
lucern
as
the
head
of
the
phalanx
and
again
they
dashed
at
the
line
before
them
but
the
second
charge
was
no
more
successful
than
the
first
schwytz
had
to
succeed
uri
and
again
unterwalden
took
the
place
of
schwytz
and
yet
nothing
more
was
effected
the
austrians
stood
victorious
while
in
front
of
them
a
long
bank
of
swiss
corpses
lay
heaped
at
the
same
moment
the
duke
s
reserve
began
to
move
with
the
intention
of
encircling
the
confederate
flank
the
critical
moment
had
come
without
some
desperate
effort
the
day
was
lost
but
while
the
swiss
were
raging
along
the
line
of
bristling
points
vainly
hacking
at
the
spears
which
pierced
them
the
necessary
impulse
was
at
last
given
to
detail
once
more
winkelried
s
heroic
death
is
unnecessary
every
one
knows
how
the
austrian
column
was
broken
how
in
the
close
combat
which
followed
the
lance
and
long
horseman
s
sword
proved
no
match
for
the
halberd
the
and
the
cutlass
how
the
duke
and
his
knights
weighed
down
by
their
heavy
armour
neither
could
nor
would
flee
and
fell
to
a
man
around
their
banner
historians
tell
us
all
this
but
what
they
forget
to
impress
upon
us
is
that
in
spite
of
his
failure
duke
leopold
was
nearer
to
success
than
any
other
commander
one
exception
alone
being
made
who
faced
the
swiss
down
to
the
day
of
marignano
his
idea
of
meeting
the
shock
of
the
swiss
phalanx
with
a
heavier
shock
of
his
own
was
feasible
his
mistakes
in
detail
ruined
a
plan
which
in
itself
was
good
the
first
fault
was
that
he
halted
to
receive
the
enemy
s
charge
and
did
not
advance
to
meet
it
thus
he
lost
most
of
the
advantage
which
the
superior
weight
of
his
men
would
have
given
in
the
clashing
of
the
columns
he
was
equally
misguided
in
making
no
attempt
to
press
on
the
confederates
when
their
first
three
charges
had
failed
and
so
allowing
them
time
to
rally
moreover
he
made
no
adequate
use
of
his
mounted
squadron
in
reserve
his
light
troops
and
the
artillery
which
we
know
that
he
had
with
him
if
these
had
been
employed
on
the
swiss
flanks
at
the
proper
moment
they
would
have
decided
the
day
but
leopold
only
used
his
artillery
to
open
the
combat
and
kept
his
crossbowmen
and
slingers
in
the
rear
probably
out
of
that
feudal
superstition
which
demanded
that
the
knight
should
have
the
most
important
part
in
the
battle
neglecting
these
precautions
he
lost
the
day
but
only
after
some
of
the
hardest
fighting
which
the
swiss
ever
experienced
what
a
better
general
could
do
by
the
employment
of
leopold
s
tactical
experiment
was
shown
years
later
on
the
field
of
arbedo
on
that
occasion
carmagnola
the
milanese
general
who
then
met
the
confederates
for
the
first
time
opened
the
engagement
with
a
cavalry
charge
observing
its
entire
failure
the
experienced
condottiere
at
once
resorted
to
another
form
of
attack
he
dismounted
the
whole
of
his
and
launched
them
in
a
single
column
against
the
swiss
phalanx
the
enemy
a
body
of
men
from
uri
unterwalden
zug
and
lucern
were
mainly
halberdiers
the
pikemen
and
crossbowmen
forming
only
a
third
of
their
force
the
two
masses
met
and
engaged
in
a
fair
duel
between
lance
and
sword
on
the
one
hand
and
pike
and
halberd
on
the
other
the
impetus
of
the
larger
force
bore
down
that
of
the
smaller
and
in
spite
of
the
desperate
fighting
of
their
enemies
the
milanese
began
to
gain
ground
so
hardly
were
the
confederates
now
pressed
that
the
schultheiss
of
lucern
even
thought
of
surrender
and
planted
his
halberd
in
the
ground
in
token
of
submission
carmagnola
however
heated
with
the
fight
cried
out
that
men
who
gave
no
quarter
should
receive
none
and
continued
his
advance
he
was
on
the
very
point
of
victory
when
a
new
swiss
force
suddenly
appeared
in
his
rear
believing
them
to
be
the
contingents
of
zürich
schwytz
glarus
and
appenzell
which
he
knew
to
be
at
no
great
distance
carmagnola
drew
off
his
men
and
began
to
reform
but
in
reality
the
were
only
a
band
of
foragers
they
made
no
attack
while
the
swiss
took
advantage
of
the
relaxation
of
the
pressure
to
retire
in
good
order
they
had
lost
men
according
to
their
own
acknowledgment
many
more
if
italian
accounts
are
to
be
received
carmagnola
s
loss
though
numerically
larger
bore
no
such
proportion
to
his
whole
force
and
had
indeed
been
mainly
incurred
in
the
unsuccessful
cavalry
charge
which
opened
the
action
from
the
results
of
sempach
and
arbedo
it
seems
natural
to
draw
the
conclusion
that
a
judicious
employment
of
dismounted
might
have
led
to
success
if
properly
combined
with
the
use
of
other
arms
the
experiment
however
was
never
repeated
by
the
enemies
of
the
swiss
indeed
almost
the
only
consequence
which
we
can
attribute
to
it
is
a
decree
of
the
council
of
lucern
that
since
things
had
not
gone
altogether
well
with
the
confederates
a
larger
proportion
of
the
army
was
in
future
to
be
furnished
with
the
pike
a
weapon
which
unlike
the
halberd
could
contend
on
superior
terms
with
the
lance
putting
aside
the
two
battles
which
we
have
last
examined
we
may
say
that
for
the
first
years
of
their
career
the
swiss
were
so
fortunate
as
never
to
meet
either
with
a
master
of
the
art
of
war
or
with
any
new
form
of
tactical
efficiency
which
could
rival
their
own
phalanx
it
was
still
with
the
mailed
horsemen
or
the
motley
and
undisciplined
of
the
middle
ages
that
they
had
to
deal
their
tactics
had
been
framed
for
successful
conflict
with
such
forces
and
continued
to
preserve
an
ascendancy
over
them
the
free
lances
of
enguerrand
de
coucy
the
burghers
and
nobles
of
swabia
the
knights
who
followed
frederick
or
leopold
or
sigismund
of
hapsburg
were
none
of
them
exponents
of
a
new
system
and
served
each
in
their
turn
to
demonstrate
yet
more
clearly
the
superiority
of
the
confederates
in
military
skill
even
the
most
dangerous
attack
ever
aimed
against
switzerland
the
invasion
by
the
armagnac
mercenaries
of
the
dauphin
louis
in
was
destined
to
result
in
the
increase
of
the
warlike
reputation
of
its
soldiery
the
battle
of
jacob
mad
and
unnecessary
though
it
was
might
serve
as
an
example
to
deter
the
boldest
enemy
from
meddling
with
men
who
preferred
annihilation
to
retreat
possessed
by
the
single
idea
that
their
phalanx
could
bear
down
any
obstacle
the
confederates
deliberately
crossed
the
birs
in
face
of
an
army
of
fifteen
times
their
strength
they
attacked
it
broke
its
centre
and
were
then
surrounded
by
its
overwhelming
numbers
compelled
to
form
the
hedgehog
in
order
to
resist
the
tremendous
cavalry
charges
directed
against
them
they
remained
rooted
to
the
spot
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
the
dauphin
launched
squadron
after
squadron
at
them
but
each
in
its
turn
was
hurled
back
in
disorder
in
the
intervals
between
these
onsets
the
french
light
troops
poured
in
their
missiles
but
though
the
clump
of
pikes
and
halberds
grew
smaller
it
still
remained
impenetrable
not
until
the
evening
was
the
fighting
ended
and
then
armagnacs
lay
dead
around
the
heap
of
swiss
corpses
in
the
centre
louis
saw
that
a
few
such
victories
would
destroy
his
whole
army
and
turned
back
into
alsace
leaving
switzerland
unmolested
from
that
day
the
confederates
were
able
to
reckon
their
reputation
for
obstinate
and
invincible
courage
as
one
of
the
chief
causes
which
gave
them
political
importance
the
generals
and
armies
who
afterwards
faced
them
went
into
battle
without
full
confidence
in
themselves
it
was
no
light
matter
to
engage
with
an
enemy
who
would
not
retire
before
any
superiority
in
numbers
who
was
always
ready
for
the
fight
who
would
neither
give
nor
take
quarter
the
enemies
of
the
swiss
found
these
considerations
the
reverse
of
inspiriting
before
a
combat
it
may
almost
be
said
that
they
came
into
the
field
expecting
a
defeat
and
therefore
earned
one
this
fact
is
especially
noticeable
in
the
great
burgundian
war
if
charles
the
rash
himself
was
unawed
by
the
warlike
renown
of
his
enemies
the
same
can
not
be
said
of
his
troops
a
large
portion
of
his
motley
army
could
not
be
trusted
in
any
dangerous
crisis
the
german
italian
and
savoyard
mercenaries
knew
too
well
the
horrors
of
swiss
warfare
and
shrank
instinctively
from
the
shock
of
the
phalanx
of

might
range
his
men

could
not

they
would

old
proverb

ever
ringing
in

ears
and
so
they
were
half
beaten

had
endeavoured
to
secure
the
efficiency
of
his
army
by
enlisting
from
each
warlike
nation
of

troops
for
which
it
was
celebrated

marched
side
by
side
with
the
feudal
chivalry
of
his
burgundian
vassals
but
the
duke
had
forgotten
that
in
assembling
so
many
nationalities
under
his
banner
he
had
thrown
away
the
cohesion
which
is
in
battle
without
mutual
confidence

certainty
that
each
comrade
would
do
his
best

charles
he
had
both
outflanked
them
and
attacked
one
division
of
their
army
before
the
others
came
up
he
had
however
to
learn
that
an
army
superior
in
and
homogeneity
and
thoroughly
knowing
its
weapon
may
be
victorious
in
spite
of
all
disadvantages
owing
to
their
eagerness
for
battle
the
confederate
vanguard
vorhut
composed
of
the
troops
of

and
schwytz
had
far
outstripped
the
remainder
of
the
force
coming
swiftly
over
the
hill
side
in
one
of
their
usual
deep
columns
they
found
the
whole
burgundian
army
spread
out
before
them
in
battle
array
on
the
plain
of
granson
as
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
hill
they
at
once
saw
that
the
duke
s
cavalry
was
preparing
to
attack
them
old
experience
had
made
them
callous
to
such
sights
facing
outwards
the

awaited

the

was
made
by
the
cavalry
of
charles
left
wing
it
failed
although
the
gallant
lord
of
chateauguyon
who
led
it
forced
his
horse
among
the
pikes
and
died
at
the
foot
of
the
standard
of
schwytz
next
the
duke
himself
led
on
the
lances
of
his
guard
a
force
who
had
long
been
esteemed
the
best
troops
in
europe
they
did
all
that
brave
men
could
but
were
dashed
back
in
confusion
from
the
steady
line
of
the
swiss
now
began
to
move
forward
into
the
plain
eager
to
try
the
effect
of
the
impact
of
their
phalanx
on
the
burgundian
line
to
meet
this
advance
charles
determined
to
draw
back
his
centre
and
when
the
enemy
advanced
against
it
to
wheel
both
his
wings
round
upon
their
flank
the
manœuvre
appeared
feasible
as
the
remainder
of
the
confederate
army
was
not
yet
in
sight
orders
were
accordingly
sent
to
the
infantry
and
guns
who
were
immediately
facing
the
approaching
column
directing
them
to
retire
while
at
the
same
time
the
reserve
was
sent
to
strengthen
the
left
wing
the
body
with
which
the
duke
intended
to
deliver
his
most
crushing
stroke
the
burgundian
army
was
in
fact
engaged
in
repeating
the
movement
which
had
given
hannibal
victory
at
cannæ
their
fortune
however
was
very
different
at
the
moment
when
the
centre
had
begun
to
draw
back
and
when
the
wings
were
not
yet
engaged
the
heads
of
the
two
swiss
columns
which
had
not
before
appeared
came
over
the
brow
of
mont
aubert
moving
rapidly
towards
the
battlefield
with
the
usual
majestic
steadiness
of
their
formation
this
of
course
would
have
frustrated
charles
scheme
for
surrounding
the
first
phalanx
the
of
divisions
which
was
the
normal
swiss
array
being
now
established
the
aspect
of
the
fight
however
was
changed
even
more
suddenly
than
might
have
been
expected
connecting
the
retreat
of
their
centre
with
the
advance
of
the
swiss
the
whole
of
the
infantry
of
the
burgundian
wings
broke
and
fled
long
before
the
confederate
masses
had
come
into
contact
with
them
it
was
a
sheer
panic
caused
by
the
fact
that
the
duke
s
army
had
no
cohesion
or
confidence
in
itself
the
various
corps
in
the
moment
of
danger
could
not
rely
on
each
others
steadiness
and
seeing
what
they
imagined
to
be
the
rout
of
their
centre
had
no
further
thought
of
endeavouring
to
turn
the
fortune
of
the
day
it
may
be
said
that
no
general
could
have
foreseen
such
a
disgraceful
flight
but
at
the
same
time
the
duke
may
be
censured
for
attempting
a
delicate
manœuvre
with
an
army
destitute
of
homogeneity
and
in
face
of
an
enterprising
opponent
strategical
movements
to
the
rear
have
always
a
tendency
to
degenerate
into
undisguised
retreats
unless
the
men
are
perfectly
in
hand
and
should
therefore
be
avoided
as
much
as
possible
granson
was
for
the
swiss
only
one
more
example
of
the
powerlessness
of
the
best
cavalry
against
their
columns
of
infantry
fighting
there
was
none
at
all
in
the
second
great
defeat
which
he
suffered
at
the
hands
of
the
confederates
the
duke
was
guilty
of
far
more
flagrant
faults
in
his
generalship
his
army
was
divided
into
three
parts
which
in
the
event
of
a
flank
attack
could
bring
each
other
no
succour
the
position
which
he
had
chosen
and
fortified
for
the
covering
of
his
only
protected
them
against
an
assault
from
the
still
more
strange
was
it
that
the
burgundian
light
troops
were
held
back
so
close
to
the
that
the
duke
had
no
accurate
knowledge
of
the
movements
of
his
enemies
till
they
appeared
in
front
of
his
lines
it
was
thus
possible
for
the
confederate
army
to
march
under
cover
of
the
wood
of
morat
right
across
the
front
of
the
two
corps
which
virtually
composed
the
centre
and
left
of
charles
array
as
it
was
well
known
that
the
enemy
were
in
the
immediate
vicinity
it
is
hard
to
conceive
how
the
duke
could
be
content
to
wait
in
for
six
hours
without
sending
out
troops
to
obtain
information
it
is
nevertheless
certain
that
when
the
swiss
did
not
show
themselves
he
sent
back
his
to
camp
and
left
the
carefully
entrenched
position
in
the
charge
of
a
few
thousand
men
hardly
had
this
fault
been
committed
when
the
confederate
vanguard
appeared
on
the
outskirts
of
the
wood
of
morat
and
marched
straight
on
the
palisade
the
utterly
inadequate
garrison
made
a
bold
endeavour
to
hold
their
ground
but
in
a
few
minutes
were
driven
down
the
reverse
slope
of
the
hill
into
the
arms
of
the
troops
who
were
coming
up
in
hot
haste
from
the
camp
to
their
succour
the
swiss
following
hard
in
their
rear
pushed
the
disordered
mass
before
them
and
crushed
in
detail
each
supporting
corps
as
it
straggled
up
to
attack
them
the
greater
part
of
the
burgundian
infantry
turned
and
fled
with
far
more
excuse
than
at
granson
many
of
the
cavalry
corps
endeavoured
to
change
the
fortune
of
the
day
by
desperate
but
isolated
charges
in
which
they
met
the
usual
fate
of
those
who
endeavoured
to
break
a
swiss
phalanx
the
fighting
however
was
soon
at
an
end
and
mere
slaughter
took
its
place
while
the
van
and
of
the
confederates
followed
the
flying
crowd
who
made
off
in
the
direction
of
avenches
the
rear
came
down
on
the
italian
infantry
who
had
formed
the
besieging
force
south
of
the
town
of
morat
these
unfortunates
whose
retreat
was
cut
off
by
the
direction
which
the
flight
of
the
had
taken
were
trodden
under
foot
or
pushed
into
the
lake
by
the
impact
of
the
swiss
column
and
entirely
annihilated
scarcely
a
single
man
escaping
out
of
a
force
of
six
thousand
the
savoyard
corps
under
romont
who
had
composed
the
duke
s
extreme
left
and
were
posted
to
the
north
of
morat
escaped
by
a
hazardous
march
which
took
them
round
the
rear
of
the
confederates
though
charles
had
done
his
best
to
prepare
a
victory
for
his
enemies
by
the
faultiness
of
his
dispositions
the
management
of
the
swiss
army
at
morat
was
the
cause
of
the
completeness
of
his
overthrow
a
successful
attack
on
the
burgundian
right
would
cut
off
the
retreat
of
the
two
isolated
corps
which
composed
the
duke
s
centre
and
left
the
confederate
leaders
therefore
determined
to
assault
this
point
although
to
reach
it
they
had
to
march
straight
across
their
opponent
s
front
favoured
by
his
astonishing
oversight
in
leaving
their
march
unobserved
they
were
able
to
surprise
him
and
destroy
his
army
in
detail
before
it
could
manage
to
form
even
a
rudimentary
line
of
battle
at
nancy
the
swiss
commanders
again
displayed
considerable
skill
in
their
dispositions
the
main
battle
and
the
small
rear
column
held
back
and
attracted
the
attention
of
the
burgundian
army
while
the
van
executed
a
turning
movement
through
the
woods
which
brought
it
out
on
the
enemy
s
flank
and
made
his
position
perfectly
untenable
the
duke
s
troops
assailed
in
front
and
on
their
right
at
the
same
moment
and
having
to
deal
with
very
superior
numbers
were
not
merely
defeated
but
dispersed
or
destroyed
charles
himself
refusing
to
fly
and
fighting
desperately
to
cover
the
retreat
of
his
scattered
forces
was
surrounded
and
cleft
through
helmet
and
skull
by
the
tremendous
blow
of
a
swiss
halberd
the
generalship
displayed
at
nancy
and
morat
was
however
exceptional
among
the
confederates
after
those
battles
just
as
before
we
find
that
their
victories
continued
to
be
won
by
a
headlong
and
desperate
onset
rather
than
by
the
display
of
any
great
strategical
ability
in
the
swabian
war
of
the
credit
of
their
successes
falls
to
the
troops
rather
than
to
their
leaders
the
stormings
of
the
fortified
camps
of
hard
and
malsheide
were
wonderful
examples
of
the
power
of
unshrinking
courage
but
on
each
occasion
the
swiss
officers
seem
to
have
considered
that
they
were
discharging
their
whole
duty
when
they
led
their
men
straight
against
the
enemy
s
entrenchments
at
frastenz
the
day
was
won
by
a
desperate
charge
up
the
face
of
a
cliff
which
the
tyrolese
had
left
unguarded
as
being
inaccessible
even
at
dornach
the
last
battle
fought
on
swiss
soil
against
an
invader
till
the
eighteenth
century
the
fortune
of
the
fight
turned
on
the
superiority
of
the
confederate
to
the
swabian
pikemen
man
for
man
and
on
the
fact
that
the
lances
of
gueldres
could
not
break
the
flank
column
by
their
most
determined
onset
of
manœuvring
there
appears
to
have
been
little
of
strategical
planning
none
at
all
it
was
considered
sufficient
to
launch
the
phalanx
against
the
enemy
and
trust
to
its
power
of
bearing
down
every
obstacle
that
came
in
its
way
of
the
decline
of
swiss
their
disregard
for
the
higher
and
more
delicate
problems
of
military
science
was
destined
to
enfeeble
the
power
and
destroy
the
reputation
of
the
confederates
at
a
time
when
the
great
struggle
in
italy
was
serving
as
a
school
for
the
soldiery
of
other
european
nations
they
alone
refused
to
learn
broad
theories
drawn
from
the
works
of
the
ancients
were
being
with
the
modern
experience
of
professional
officers
and
were
developing
into
an
art
of
war
far
superior
to
anything
known
in
mediæval
times
scientific
engineers
and
artillerists
had
begun
to
modify
the
conditions
of
warfare
and
feudal
tradition
was
everywhere
discarded
new
forms
of
military
efficiency
such
as
the
men
of
spain
the
stradiot
light
cavalry
the
german
black
bands
of
musketeers
were
coming
to
the
front
the
improvement
of
the
firearms
placed
in
the
hands
of
infantry
was
only
less
important
than
the
superior
mobility
which
was
given
to
field
artillery
the
swiss
however
paid
no
attention
to
these
changes
the
world
around
them
might
alter
but
they
would
hold
fast
to
the
tactics
of
their
ancestors
at
first
indeed
their
arms
were
still
crowned
with
success
they
were
seen
in
italy
as
in
more
northern
lands
to
march
with
ten
or
fifteen
thousand
pikemen
against
any
number
of
horse
and
to
win
a
general
opinion
of
their
excellence
from
the
many
remarkable
services
they
performed
they
enjoyed
for
a
time
supreme
importance
and
left
their
mark
on
the
military
history
of
every
nation
of
central
and
southern
europe
but
it
was
impossible
that
a
single
stereotyped
tactical
method
applied
by
men
destitute
of
any
broad
and
scientific
knowledge
of
the
art
of
war
should
continue
to
assert
an
undisputed
ascendancy
the
victories
of
the
swiss
set
every
officer
of
capacity
and
versatile
talent
searching
for
an
efficient
way
of
dealing
with
the
onset
of
the
phalanx
such
a
search
was
rendered
comparatively
easy
by
the
fact
that
the
old
feudal
cavalry
and
the
worthless
mediæval
infantry
were
being
rapidly
replaced
by
disciplined
troops
men
capable
of
keeping
cool
and
collected
even
before
the
desperate
rush
of
the
confederate
pikemen
the
standing
army
of
charles
of
burgundy
had
been
rendered
inefficient
by
its
want
of
homogeneity
and
cohesion
as
well
as
by
the
bad
generalship
of
its
leader
the
standing
armies
which
fought
in
italy
thirty
years
later
were
very
different
bodies
although
still
raised
from
among
various
nations
they
were
united
by
the
bonds
of
old
comradeship
of
de
of
professional
pride
or
of
confidence
in
some
favourite
general
the
swiss
had
therefore
to
face
troops
of
a
far
higher
military
value
than
they
had
ever
before
encountered
the
first
experiment
tried
against
the
confederates
was
that
of
the
emperor
maximilian
who
raised
in
germany
corps
of
pikemen
and
halberdiers
trained
to
act
in
a
manner
exactly
similar
to
that
of
their
enemies
the
landsknechts
soon
won
for
themselves
a
reputation
only
second
to
that
of
the
swiss
whom
they
boldly
met
in
many
a
bloody
field
the
conflicts
between
them
were
rendered
obstinate
by
military
as
well
as
national
rivalry
the
confederates
being
indignant
that
any
troops
should
dare
to
face
them
with
their
own
peculiar
tactics
while
the
germans
were
determined
to
show
that
they
were
not
inferior
in
courage
to
their
alpine
kinsmen
the
shock
of
the
contending
columns
was
therefore
tremendous
the
two
bristling
lines
of
pikes
crossed
and
the
leading
files
were
thrust
upon
each
other
s
weapons
by
the
irresistible
pressure
from
behind
often
the
whole
front
rank
of
each
phalanx
went
down
in
the
first
onset
but
their
comrades
stepped
forward
over
their
bodies
to
continue
the
fight
when
the
masses
had
been
for
some
time
pushing
against
each
other
their
order
became
confused
and
their
pikes
interlocked
then
was
the
time
for
the
halberdiers
to
act
the
columns
opened
out
to
let
them
pass
or
they
rushed
round
from
the
rear
and
threw
themselves
into
the
mêlée
this
was
the
most
deadly
epoch
of
the
strife
the
combatants
mowed
each
other
down
with
fearful
rapidity
their
ponderous
weapons
allowed
of
little
fencing
and
parrying
and
inflicted
wounds
which
were
almost
invariably
mortal
everyone
who
missed
his
blow
or
stumbled
over
a
fallen
comrade
or
turned
to
fly
was
a
doomed
man
quarter
was
neither
expected
nor
given
of
course
these
fearful
combats
could
not
be
of
great
duration
one
party
had
ere
long
to
give
ground
and
suffer
the
most
fearful
losses
in
its
retreat
it
was
in
a
struggle
of
this
kind
that
the
landsknechts
lost
a
full
half
of
their
strength
when
the
swiss
bore
them
down
at
novara
even
however
when
they
were
victorious
the
confederates
found
that
their
military
ascendancy
was
growing
less
they
could
no
longer
sweep
the
enemy
from
the
field
by
a
single
unchecked
onset
but
were
confronted
by
troops
who
were
ready
to
turn
their
own
weapons
against
them
and
who
required
the
hardest
pressure
before
they
would
give
ground
in
spite
of
their
defeats
the
landsknechts
kept
the
field
and
finally
took
their
revenge
when
the
swiss
recoiled
in
disorder
from
the
fatal
trenches
of
bicocca
there
was
however
an
enemy
even
more
formidable
than
the
german
who
was
to
appear
upon
the
scene
at
a
slightly
later
date
the
spanish
infantry
of
gonsalvo
de
cordova
displayed
once
more
to
the
military
world
the
strength
of
the
tactics
of
old
rome
they
were
armed
like
the
men
of
the
ancient
legion
with
the
short
thrusting
sword
and
buckler
and
wore
the
steel
cap
and
and
greaves
thus
they
were
far
stronger
in
their
defensive
armour
than
the
swiss
whom
they
were
about
to
encounter
when
the
pikeman
and
the
swordsman
first
met
in
under
the
walls
of
barletta
the
old
problem
of
pydna
and
cynoscephalæ
was
once
more
worked
out
a
phalanx
as
solid
and
efficient
as
that
of
philip
the
macedonian
was
met
by
troops
whose
tactics
were
those
of
the
legionaries
of
æmilius
paullus
then
as
in
an
earlier
age
the
wielders
of
the
shorter
weapon
prevailed
when
they
came
to
engage
the
swiss
at
first
pressed
so
hard
on
their
enemy
with
the
pike
that
they
opened
out
their
ranks
but
the
spaniards
under
the
cover
of
their
bucklers
nimbly
rushed
in
upon
them
with
their
swords
and
laid
about
them
so
furiously
that
they
made
a
great
slaughter
of
the
swiss
and
gained
a
complete
victory
the
vanquished
in
fact
suffered
at
the
hands
of
the
spaniard
the
treatment
which
they
themselves
had
inflicted
on
the
austrians
at
sempach
the
bearer
of
the
longer
weapon
becomes
helpless
when
his
opponent
has
closed
with
him
whether
the
arms
concerned
be
lance
and
halberd
or
pike
and
sword
the
moment
a
breach
had
been
made
in
a
macedonian
or
swiss
phalanx
the
great
length
of
their
spears
became
their
ruin
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
drop
them
and
in
the
combat
which
then
ensued
troops
using
the
sword
alone
and
without
defensive
armour
were
at
a
hopeless
disadvantage
in
attacking
men
furnished
with
the
buckler
as
well
as
the
sword
and
protected
by
a
more
complete
panoply
whatever
may
be
the
result
of
a
duel
between
sword
and
spear
alone
it
is
certain
that
when
a
light
shield
is
added
to
the
swordsman
s
equipment
he
at
once
obtains
the
ascendancy
the
buckler
serves
to
turn
aside
the
and
then
the
thrusting
weapon
is
free
to
do
its
work
it
was
therefore
natural
that
when
spanish
and
swiss
infantry
met
the
former
should
in
almost
every
case
obtain
success
the
powerlessness
of
the
pike
however
was
most
strikingly
displayed
at
a
battle
in
which
the
fortune
of
the
day
had
not
been
favourable
to
spain
at
the
fight
of
ravenna
gaston
de
foix
had
succeeded
in
driving
don
ramon
de
cardona
from
his
intrenchments
and
was
endeavouring
to
secure
the
fruits
of
victory
by
a
vigorous
pursuit
to
intercept
the
retreat
of
the
spanish
infantry
who
were
retiring
in
good
order
gaston
sent
forward
the
pikemen
of
jacob
empser
then
serving
as
auxiliaries
beneath
the
french
banner
these
troops
accordingly
fell
on
the
retreating
column
and
attempted
to
arrest
its
march
the
spaniards
however
turned
at
once
and
fell
furiously
on
the
germans
rushing
at
the
pikes
or
throwing
themselves
on
the
ground
and
slipping
below
the
points
so
that
they
darted
in
among
the
legs
of
the
pikemen
a
manœuvre
which
reminds
us
of
the
conduct
of
the
soudanese
arabs
at
el
teb
in
this
way
they
succeeded
in
closing
with
their
opponents
and
made
such
good
use
of
their
swords
that
not
a
german
would
have
escaped
had
not
the
french
horse
come
up
to
their
rescue
this
fight
was
typical
of
many
more
in
which
during
the
first
quarter
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
sword
and
buckler
were
proved
to
be
able
to
master
the
pike
it
may
therefore
be
asked
why
in
the
face
of
these
facts
the
swiss
weapon
remained
in
use
while
the
spanish
infantry
finally
discarded
their
peculiar
tactics
to
this
question
the
answer
is
found
in
the
consideration
that
the
sword
was
not
suited
for
repulsing
a
cavalry
charge
while
the
pike
continued
to
be
used
for
that
purpose
down
to
the
invention
of
the
bayonet
in
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
machiavelli
was
from
his
studies
in
roman
antiquity
the
most
devoted
admirer
of
the
spanish
system
which
seemed
to
bring
back
the
days
of
the
ancient
legion
yet
even
he
conceded
that
the
pike
a
weapon
which
he
is
on
every
occasion
ready
to
disparage
must
be
retained
by
a
considerable
portion
of
those
ideal
armies
for
whose
guidance
he
drew
up
his
art
of
he
could
think
of
no
other
arm
which
could
resist
a
charge
of
cavalry
steadily
pressed
home
and
was
therefore
obliged
to
combine
pikemen
with
his
velites
and
the
rapid
development
of
the
arts
of
the
engineer
and
artillerist
aimed
another
heavy
blow
at
the
swiss
supremacy
the
energy
of
the
renaissance
period
not
unfrequently
made
the
professional
soldier
a
scholar
and
set
him
to
adapt
the
science
of
the
ancients
to
the
requirements
of
modern
warfare
the
most
cursory
study
of
vegetius
hyginus
or
vitruvius
all
of
them
authors
much
esteemed
at
the
time
would
suffice
to
show
the
strength
of
the
roman
fortified
camp
accordingly
the
art
of
castramentation
revived
and
corps
of
pioneers
were
attached
to
every
army
it
became
common
to
intrench
not
merely
permanent
positions
but
camps
which
were
to
be
held
for
a
few
days
only
advantage
was
taken
of
favourable
sites
and
lines
of
greater
or
less
strength
with
emplacements
for
artillery
were
constructed
for
the
protection
of
the
army
which
felt
itself
inferior
in
the
field
many
of
the
greatest
battles
of
the
italian
wars
were
fought
in
and
around
such
positions
ravenna
bicocca
and
pavia
are
obvious
examples
still
more
frequently
a
general
threw
himself
with
all
his
forces
into
a
fortified
town
and
covered
it
with
outworks
and
redoubts
till
it
resembled
an
intrenched
camp
rather
than
a
mere
fortress
such
a
phase
in
war
was
most
disadvantageous
to
the
swiss
even
the
most
desperate
courage
can
not
carry
men
over
stone
walls
or
through
flooded
ditches
if
they
neglect
the
art
which
teaches
them
how
to
approach
such
obstacles
the
confederates
in
their
earlier
days
had
never
displayed
much
skill
in
attacking
places
of
strength
and
now
when
the
enemy
s
position
was
as
frequently
behind
defences
as
in
the
open
plain
they
refused
to
adapt
their
tactics
to
the
altered
circumstances
occasionally
as
for
example
at
the
storming
of
the
outworks
of
genoa
in
they
were
still
able
to
sweep
the
enemy
before
them
by
the
mere
vehemence
of
their
onset
but
more
frequently
disaster
followed
the
headlong
rush
delivered
against
lines
held
by
an
adequate
number
of
steady
troops
of
this
the
most
striking
instance
was
seen
in
when
the
swiss
columns
attempted
to
dislodge
the
enemy
from
the
fortified
park
of
bicocca
under
a
severe
fire
from
the
spanish
they
crossed
several
hedges
and
flooded
trenches
which
covered
the
main
position
of
the
imperialists
but
when
they
came
to
the
last
ditch
and
bank
along
which
were
ranged
the
landsknechts
of
frundsberg
they
found
an
obstacle
which
they
could
not
pass
leaping
into
the
deep
excavation
the
front
ranks
endeavoured
to
scramble
up
its
further
slope
but
every
man
who
made
the
attempt
fell
beneath
the
of
the
germans
who
standing
on
a
higher
level
in
their
serried
ranks
kept
back
the
incessant
rushes
with
the
greatest
steadiness
three
thousand
corpses
were
left
in
the
ditch
before
the
swiss
would
desist
from
their
hopeless
undertaking
it
was
an
attack
which
for
misplaced
daring
rivals
the
british
assault
on
ticonderoga
in
the
improved
artillery
of
the
early
sixteenth
century
worked
even
more
havoc
with
the
confederates
of
all
formations
the
phalanx
is
the
easiest
at
which
to
aim
and
the
one
which
suffers
most
loss
from
each
cannon
ball
which
strikes
it
a
single
shot
ploughing
through
its
serried
ranks
might
disable
twenty
men
yet
the
swiss
persisted
in
rushing
straight
for
the
front
of
batteries
and
storming
them
in
spite
of
their
murderous
fire
such
conduct
might
conceivably
have
been
justifiable
in
the
fifteenth
century
when
the
clumsy
guns
of
the
day
could
seldom
deliver
more
than
a
single
discharge
between
the
moment
at
which
the
enemy
came
within
range
and
that
at
which
he
reached
their
muzzles
scientific
artillerists
however
such
as
pietro
navarro
and
alphonso
d
este
made
cannon
a
real
power
in
battles
by
increasing
its
mobility
and
the
rapidity
of
its
fire
none
the
less
the
confederates
continued
to
employ
the
front
attack
which
had
become
four
or
five
times
more
dangerous
in
the
space
of
forty
years
a
fearful
lesson
as
to
the
recklessness
of
such
tactics
was
given
them
at
marignano
where
in
spite
of
the
gallantry
of
the
french
gendarmerie
it
was
the
artillery
which
really
won
the
day
the
system
which
francis
advisers
there
employed
was
to
deliver
charge
after
charge
of
cavalry
on
the
flanks
of
the
swiss
columns
while
the
artillery
played
upon
them
from
the
front
the
onsets
of
the
cavalry
though
they
never
succeeded
in
breaking
the
phalanx
forced
it
to
halt
and
form
the
the
men
at
arms
came
on
in
bodies
of
about
five
hundred
strong
one
taking
up
the
fight
when
the
first
had
been
beaten
off
in
this
way
more
than
thirty
fine
charges
were
delivered
and
no
one
will
in
future
be
able
to
say
that
cavalry
are
of
no
more
use
than
hares
in
armour
wrote
the
king
to
his
mother
of
course
these
attacks
would
by
themselves
have
been
fruitless
it
was
the
fact
that
they
checked
the
advance
of
the
swiss
and
obliged
them
to
stand
halted
under
artillery
fire
that
settled
the
result
of
the
battle
at
last
the
columns
had
suffered
so
severely
that
they
gave
up
the
attempt
to
advance
and
retired
in
good
order
unbroken
but
diminished
by
a
half
in
their
size
last
but
not
least
important
among
the
causes
of
the
decline
of
the
military
ascendancy
of
the
confederates
was
the
continual
deterioration
of
their
discipline
while
among
other
nations
the
commanders
were
becoming
more
and
more
masters
of
the
art
of
war
among
the
swiss
they
were
growing
more
and
more
the
slaves
of
their
own
soldiery
the
division
of
their
authority
had
always
been
detrimental
to
the
development
of
strategical
skill
but
it
now
began
to
make
even
tactical
arrangements
impossible
the
army
looked
upon
itself
as
a
democracy
entitled
to
direct
the
proceedings
of
its
ministry
rather
than
a
body
under
military
discipline
filled
with
a
blind
confidence
in
the
invincibility
of
their
onset
they
calmly
neglected
the
orders
which
appeared
to
them
superfluous
on
several
occasions
they
delivered
an
attack
on
the
front
of
a
position
which
it
had
been
intended
to
turn
on
others
they
began
the
conflict
although
they
had
been
directed
to
wait
for
the
arrival
of
other
divisions
before
giving
battle
if
things
were
not
going
well
they
threw
away
even
the
semblance
of
obedience
to
their
leaders
before
bicocca
the
cry
was
raised
where
are
the
officers
the
pensioners
the
men
let
them
come
out
and
earn
their
money
fairly
for
once
they
shall
all
fight
in
the
front
rank
what
was
even
more
astonishing
than
the
arrogance
of
the
demand
was
the
fact
that
it
was
obeyed
the
commanders
and
captains
stepped
forward
and
formed
the
head
of
the
leading
column
hardly
one
of
them
survived
the
fight
and
winkelried
of
unterwalden
the
leader
of
the
was
the
first
to
fall
under
the
lances
of
frundsberg
s
landsknechts
what
was
to
be
expected
from
an
army
in
which
the
men
gave
the
orders
and
the
officers
executed
them
brute
strength
and
heedless
courage
were
the
only
qualities
now
employed
by
the
swiss
while
against
them
were
pitted
the
scientific
generals
of
the
new
school
of
war
the
result
was
what
might
have
been
expected
the
pike
tactics
which
had
been
the
admiration
of
europe
were
superseded
because
they
had
become
stereotyped
and
the
swiss
lost
their
proud
position
as
the
most
formidable
infantry
in
the
world
vi
the
english
and
their
enemies
from
the
accession
of
edward
i
to
the
end
of
the
wars
of
the
roses
the
use
of
the
is
as
much
the
key
to
the
successes
of
the
english
armies
in
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
as
that
of
the
pike
is
to
the
successes
of
the
swiss
dissimilar
as
were
the
characters
of
the
two
weapons
and
the
national
tactics
to
which
their
use
led
they
were
both
employed
for
the
same
end
of
terminating
the
ascendancy
in
war
of
the
mailed
horseman
of
the
feudal
it
is
certainly
not
the
least
curious
part
of
the
military
history
of
the
period
that
the
commanders
who
made
such
good
use
of
their
archery
had
no
conception
of
the
tendencies
of
their
action
edward
the
black
prince
and
his
father
regarded
themselves
as
the
flower
of
chivalry
and
would
have
been
horrified
had
they
realised
that
their
own
tactics
were
going
far
to
make
chivalrous
warfare
impossible
such
however
was
the
case
that
unscientific
kind
of
combat
which
resembled
a
huge
tilting
match
could
not
continue
if
one
side
persisted
in
bringing
into
the
field
auxiliaries
who
could
prevent
their
opponents
from
approaching
near
enough
to
break
a
lance
the
needs
of
the
moment
however
prevented
the
english
commanders
being
troubled
by
such
thoughts
they
made
the
best
use
of
the
material
at
their
disposal
and
if
they
thus
found
themselves
able
to
beat
the
enemy
they
were
satisfied
it
is
not
till
the
last
quarter
of
the
thirteenth
century
that
we
find
the
taking
up
its
position
as
the
national
weapon
of
england
in
the
armies
of
our
norman
and
angevin
kings
archers
were
indeed
to
be
found
but
they
formed
neither
the
most
numerous
nor
the
most
effective
part
of
the
array
on
this
side
of
the
channel
just
as
beyond
it
the
supremacy
of
the
mailed
horseman
was
still
unquestioned
it
is
indeed
noteworthy
that
the
theory
which
attributes
to
the
normans
the
introduction
of
the
is
difficult
to
substantiate
if
we
are
to
trust
the
bayeux
tapestry
whose
accuracy
is
in
other
matters
thoroughly
borne
out
by
all
contemporary
evidence
the
weapon
of
william
s
archers
was
in
no
way
different
to
that
already
known
in
england
and
used
by
a
few
of
the
english
in
the
fight
of
senlac
it
is
the
drawn
to
the
breast
and
not
to
the
ear
the
bowmen
who
are
occasionally
mentioned
during
the
succeeding
century
as
for
example
those
present
at
the
battle
of
the
standard
do
not
appear
to
form
any
very
important
part
of
the
national
force
nothing
can
be
more
conclusive
as
to
the
insignificance
of
the
weapon
than
the
fact
that
it
is
not
mentioned
at
all
in
the
assize
of
arms
of
in
the
reign
of
henry
ii
therefore
we
may
fairly
conclude
that
the
bow
did
not
form
the
proper
weapon
of
any
class
of
english
society
a
similar
deduction
is
suggested
by
richard
cœur
de
lion
s
predilection
for
the
arbalest
it
is
impossible
that
he
should
have
introduced
that
weapon
as
a
new
and
superior
arm
if
he
had
been
acquainted
with
the
splendid
of
the
fourteenth
century
it
is
evident
that
the
bow
must
always
preserve
an
advantage
in
rapidity
of
fire
over
the
arbalest
the
latter
must
therefore
have
been
considered
by
richard
to
surpass
in
range
and
penetrating
power
but
nothing
is
better
established
than
the
fact
that
the
trained
archer
of
the
hundred
years
war
was
able
to
beat
the
on
both
these
points
it
is
therefore
rational
to
conclude
that
the
weapon
superseded

times

this

first
place
among
light
troops
during
the
reigns
of
richard
and
john
the
former

devised
for
them
a
system
of
tactics
in
which
the

made
to
play
a
prominent
part
the
latter
entertained
great
numbers
both
of
and
among
those
mercenary
bands
who
were
such
a
scourge
to
england
it
would
appear
that
the
barons
in
their
contest
with
john
suffered
greatly
from
having
no
adequate
provision
of
infantry
armed
with
missiles
to
oppose
the
of
fawkes
de
breauté
and
his
fellows
even
in
the
reign
of
henry
iii
the
epoch
in
which
the
begins
to
come
into
use
the
arbalest
was
still
reckoned
the
more
effective
arm
at
the
battle
of
taillebourg
in
a
corps
of
men
armed
with
it
were
considered
to
be
the
flower
of
the
english
infantry
to
trace
the
true
origin
of
the
is
not
easy
there
are
reasons
for
believing
that
it
may
have
been
borrowed
from
the
south
welsh
who
were
certainly
provided
with
it
as
early
as
against
this
derivation
however
may
be
pleaded
the
fact
that
in
the
first
half
of
the
thirteenth
century
it
appears
to
have
been
in
greater
vogue
in
the
northern
than
in
the
western
counties
of
england
as
a
national
weapon
it
is
first
accepted
in
the
assize
of
arms
of
wherein
all
holders
of
in
land
or
nine
marks
in
chattels
are
desired
to
provide
themselves
with
sword
dagger
bow
and
arrows
contemporary
documents
often
speak
of
the
obligation
of
various
manors
to
provide
the
king
with
one
or
more
archers
when
he
makes
an
expedition
against
the
it
is
curious
to
observe
that
even
as
late
as
the
preference
for
the
seems
to
have
been
kept
up
the
wages
of
its
bearer
being
considerably
more

those

edward

the
owes
its
original
rise
into
favour
that
monarch
like
his
grandson
and
was
an
able
soldier
and
capable
of
devising
new
expedients
in
war
his
long
experience
in
welsh
campaigns
led
him
to
introduce
a
scientific
use
of
archery
much
like
that
which
william
the
conqueror
had
employed
at
hastings
we
are
informed
that
it
was
first
put
in
practice
in
a
combat
fought
against
prince
llewellin
at
orewin
bridge
and
afterwards
copied
by
the
earl
of
warwick
in
another
engagement
during
the
year
the
welsh
on
the
earl
s
approach
set
themselves
fronting
his
force
with
exceeding
long
spears
which
being
suddenly
turned
toward
the
earl
and
his
company
with
their
ends
placed
in
the
earth
and
their
points
upward
broke
the
force
of
the
english
cavalry
but
the
earl
well
provided
against
them
by
placing
archers
between
his
so
that
by
these
missive
weapons
those
who
held
the
lances
were
put
to
rout
the
battle
of
falkirk
however
is
the
first
engagement
of
real
importance
in
which
the
bowmen
properly
supplemented
by
cavalry
played
the
leading
part
its
circumstances
indeed
bore
such
striking
witness
to
the
power
of
the
arrow
that
it
could
not
fail
to
serve
as
a
lesson
to
english
commanders
the
scots
of
the
lowlands
who
formed
the
army
of
wallace
consisted
mainly
of
spearmen
armed
like
the
swiss
with
a
pike
of
many
feet
in
length
they
had
in
their
ranks
a
small
body
of
horse
a
few
hundred
in
number
and
a
certain
proportion
of
archers
mainly
drawn
from
the
ettrick
and
selkirk
district
wallace
having
selected
an
excellent
position
behind
a
marsh
formed
his
spearmen
in
four
great
masses
or
schiltrons
as
the
scotch
called
them
of
circular
form
ready
to
face
outward
in
any
direction
the
light
troops
formed
a
line
in
the
intervals
of
these
columns
while
the
cavalry
were
placed
in
reserve
edward
came
on
with
his
horsemen
in
three
divisions
and
his
archers
disposed
between
them
the
foremost
english
battle
that
of
the
earl
marshal
rode
into
the
morass
was
stopped
by
it
and
suffered
severely
from
the
scotch
missile
weapons
the
second
division
commanded
by
the
bishop
of
durham
observing
this
check
rode
round
the
flank
of
the
marsh
in
order
to
turn
wallace
s
position
the
small
body
of
scotch
cavalry
endeavoured
to
stay
their
advance
but
were
driven
completely
off
the
field
by
superior
numbers
then
the
bishop
s
horsemen
charged
the
hostile
line
from
the
rear
the
squadrons
opposed
to
the
light
troops
succeeded
in
riding
them
down
as
wallace
s
archers
were
only
armed
with
the
and
were
not
particularly
skilled
in
its
use
those
of
the
english
however
who
faced
the
masses
of
pikemen
received
a
sanguinary
check
and
were
thrown
back
in
disorder
the
bishop
had
therefore
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
king
who
was
leading
the
infantry
and
the
remainder
of
the
cavalry
round
the
end
of
the
marsh
when
this
had
been
done
edward
brought
up
his
bowmen
close
to
the
scotch
masses
who
were
unable
to
reply
as
their
own
light
troops
had
been
driven
away
or
to
charge
on
account
of
the
nearness
of
the
english
concentrating
the
rain
of
arrows
on
particular
points
in
the
columns
the
king
fairly
riddled
the
scotch
ranks
and
then
sent
in
his
cavalry
with
a
sudden
impetus
the
plan
succeeded
the
shaken
parts
of
the
masses
were
pierced
and
the
knights
having
once
got
within
the
pikes
made
a
fearful
slaughter
of
the
enemy
the
moral
of
the
fight
was
evident
cavalry
could
not
beat
the
scotch
tactics
but
archers
supplemented
by
horsemen
could
easily
accomplish
the
required
task
accordingly
for
the
next
two
centuries
the
characteristics
of
the
fight
of
falkirk
were
continually
repeated
whenever
the
english
and
scotch
met
halidon
hill
neville
s
cross
homildon
flodden
were
all
variations
on
the
same
theme
the
steady
but
masses
of
the
lowland
infantry
fell
a
sacrifice
to
their
own
persistent
bravery
when
they
staggered
on
in
a
vain
endeavour
to
reach
the
line
of
archers
flanked
by
whom
the
english
commander
opposed
to
them
the
bowman
might
boast
with
truth
that
he
carried
twelve
scots
lives
at
his
girdle
he
had
but
to
launch
his
shaft
into
the
easy
target
of
the
great
surging

a

the

its
result
however
was
due
not
to
an

discard
the
tactics
of
falkirk
but
to
an
unskilful
application

them
the

much
like
those

of

a

and
less
than

were
drawn

in

very
compact
position
flanked
by
marshy
ground
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
by
a
quantity
of

destined
to
arrest

ii
refrained
from
any
attempt
to
turn
bruce
s
army
and
by
endeavouring
to
make
men
cover
no
more
space
in
frontage
than
cramped
his
array
and
made
manœuvres
impossible
his
most
fatal
mistake
however
was
to
place
all
his
archers
in
the
front
line
without
any
protecting
body
of
horsemen
the
arrows
were
already
falling
among
the
scotch
columns
before
the
english
cavalry
had
fully
arrived
upon
the
field
bruce
at
once
saw
his
opportunity
his
small
body
of
was
promptly
put
in
motion
against
the
bowmen
a
front
attack
on
them
would
of
course
have
been
futile
but
a
flank
charge
was
rendered
possible
by
the
absence
of
the
english
squadrons
which
ought
to
have
covered
the
wings
riding
rapidly
round
the
edge
of
the
morass
the
scotch
horse
fell
on
the
uncovered
line
rolled
it
up
from
end
to
end
and
wrought
fearful
damage
by
their
unexpected
onset
the
archers
were
so
maltreated
that
they
took
no
further
effective
part
in
the
battle
enraged
at
the
sudden
rout
of
his
first
line
edward
flung
his
great
masses
of
cavalry
on
the
comparatively
narrow
front
of
the
scotch
army
the
steady
columns
received
them
and
drove
them
back
again
and
again
with
ease
at
last
every
had
been
thrown
into
the
and
the
splendid
force
of
english
horsemen
had
become
a
mere
mob
surging
helplessly
in
front
of
the
enemy
s
line
and
executing
partial
and
ineffective
charges
on
a
cramped
terrain
finally
their
spirit
for
fighting
was
exhausted
and
when
a
body
of
appeared
on
the
hill
behind
bruce
s
position
a
rumour
spread
around
that
reinforcements
were
arriving
for
the
scots
the
english
were
already
hopeless
of
success
and
now
turned
their
reins
to
retreat
when
the
scotch
masses
moved
on
in
pursuit
a
panic
seized
the
broken
army
and
the
whole
force
dispersed
in
disorder
many
galloped
into
the
pits
on
the
left
these
were
dismounted
and
slain
or
captured
a
few
stayed
behind
to
fight
and
met
a
similar
fate
the
majority
made
at
once
for
the
english
border
and
considered
themselves
fortunate
if
they
reached
berwick
or
carlisle
without
being
intercepted
and
slaughtered
by
the
peasantry
the
moral
of
the
day
had
been
that
the
archery
must
be
adequately
supported
on
its
flanks
by
troops
capable
of
arresting
a
cavalry
charge
the
lesson
was
not
thrown
away
and
at
creçy
and
maupertuis
the
requisite
assistance
was
given
with
the
happiest
of
results
the
next
series
of
campaigns
in
which
the
english
bowman
was
to
take
part
were
directed
against
an
enemy
different
in
every
respect
from
the
sturdy
spearman
of
the
lowlands
in
france
those
absurd
perversions
of
the
art
of
war
which
covered
themselves
under
the
name
of
chivalry
were
more
omnipotent
than
in
any
other
country
of
europe
the
strength
of
the
armies
of
philip
and
john
of
valois
was
composed
of
a
fiery
and
undisciplined
aristocracy
which
imagined
itself
to
be
the
most
efficient
military
force
in
the
world
but
was
in
reality
little
removed
from
an
armed
mob
a
system
which
reproduced
on
the
battlefield
the
distinctions
of
feudal
society
was
considered
by
the
french
noble
to
represent
the
ideal
form
of
warlike
organization
he
firmly
believed
that
since
he
was
infinitely
superior
to
any
peasant
in
the
social
scale
he
must
consequently
excel
him
to
the
same
extent
in
military
value
he
was
therefore
prone
not
only
to
despise
all
descriptions
of
infantry
but
to
regard
their
appearance
on
the
field
against
him
as
a
species
of
insult
to
his

of
the
french
nobility

the
moment

the
result
of
courtray

itself

the
bloody
days
of
and
cassel
the
fate
which
had
on
those
occasions
befallen
the
gallant
but
burghers
of
flanders
was
believed
to
be
only
typical
of
that
which
awaited
any
who
dared
to
match
himself
against
the
chivalry
of
the
most
warlike
aristocracy
in
christendom
pride
goes
before
a
fall
and
the
french
noble
was
now
to
meet
infantry
of
a
quality
such
as
he
had
never
supposed
to
exist
against
these
presumptuous
cavaliers
their
mercenaries
and
the
wretched
band
of
villains
whom
they
dragged
with
them
to
the
battlefield
the
english
archer
was
now
matched
he
was
by
this
time
almost
a
professional
soldier
being
usually
not
a
pressed
man
but
a
volunteer
raised
by
one
of
those
barons
or
knights
with
whom
the
king
contracted
for
a
supply
of
soldiers
led
to
enlist
by
sheer
love
of
fighting
desire
for
adventures
or
national
pride
he
possessed
a
great
moral
ascendancy
over
the
spiritless
hordes
who
followed
the
french
nobility
to
the
wars
historians
however
have
laid
too
much
stress
on
this
superiority
real
as
it
was
no
amount
of
mere
readiness
to
fight
would
have
accounted
for
the
english
victories
of
the
fourteenth
century
and
pugnacity
were
not
wanting
in
the
fleming
at
rosbecque
or
the
scot
at
falkirk
yet
they
did
not
secure
success
it
was
the
excellent
armament
and
tactics
of
our
yeomanry
even
more
than
their
courage
which
made
them
masters
of
the
field
at
creçy
or
poictiers
the
had
as
yet
been
employed
only
in
offensive
warfare
and
against
an
enemy
inferior
in
cavalry
to
the
english
army
when
however
edward
iii
led
his
invading
force
into
france
the
conditions
of
war
were
entirely
changed
the
french
were
invariably
superior
in
the
numbers
of
their
horsemen
and
the
tactics
of
the
archer
had
to
be
adapted
to
the
defensive
he
was
soon
to
find
that
the
charging
squadron
presented
as
good
a
mark
for
his
shaft
as
the
stationary
column
of
infantry
nothing
indeed
could
be
more
discomposing
to
a
body
of
cavalry
than
a
flight
of
arrows
not
only
did
it
lay
low
a
certain
proportion
of
the
riders
but
it
caused
such
disorder
by
setting
the
wounded
horses
plunging
and
rearing
among
their
fellows
that
it
was
most
effective
in
checking
the
impetus
of
the
onset
as
the
distance
grew
shorter
and
the
range
more
easy
the
wounds
to
horse
and
man
became
more
numerous
the
disorder
increased
the
pace
continued
to
slacken
and
at
last
a
limit
was
reached
beyond
which
the
squadron
could
not
pass
to
force
a
line
of
by
a
mere
front
attack
was
a
task
almost
as
hopeless
for
cavalry
as
the
breaking
of
a
modern
square
this
however
was
a
fact
which
the
continental
world
had
yet
to
learn
in
the
year
the
scientific
method
of
receiving
a
charge
of
horsemen
by
archers
flanked
with
supporting
troops
was
first
practised
by
edward
iii
at
creçy
when
he
determined
to
fight
he
chose
an
excellent
position
on
the
gentle
slope
of
a
hill
whose
flanks
were
protected
by
woods
and
a
little
brook
which
also
ran
along
the
front
of
the
line
following
the
immemorial
usage
of
the
middle
ages
the
army
was
drawn
up
in
three
battles
of
which
the
foremost
was
commanded
by
the
prince
of
wales
the
second
by
the
earl
of
northampton
and
the
third
by
the
king
himself
in
the
front
battle
on
which
the
greater
part
of
the
fighting
was
to
fall
archers
were
flanked
by
two

dismounted
who
stood
in
solid
phalanx
with
their
lances
before
them
to
receive

charges
directed
against

wings
of
the

the

was
formed

between
the
two
were
ranged

armed
with

nothing
could
be
more
characteristic
of
the
indiscipline
of

than
the
fact
that
it
forced
on
the
battle
a
day
sooner
than
its
leader
had
intended

the

and
his

had
determined
to
defer

conflict
till
the
next
morning
as
the
troops
had
been
marching
since
daybreak
when
however
the
order
to
halt
reached
the
vanguard
the
nobles
at
the
head
of
the
column
believed
that
they
were
to
be
deprived
of
the
honour
of
opening
the
fight
as
they
could
see
that
some
of
the
troops
in
the
rear
were
still
advancing
they
therefore
pushed
on
and
as
the
persisted
in
following
them
the
whole
army
arrived
so
close
to
the
english
position
that
a
battle
became
unavoidable
the
circumstances
of
that
day
have
often
been
described
it
is
unnecessary
to
detail
the
mishap
of
the
unfortunate
genoese
crossbowmen
who
were
shot
down
in
scores
while
going
through
the
cumbrous
process
of
winding
up
their
arbalests
the
fruitless
charges
of
the
cavalry
against
the
front
of
the
line
of
archers
led
to
endless
slaughter

the

was
heaped

attempts
to
advance
became
impossible
only
on
the
flanks
was
the
charge
pressed
home
but
when
the
counts
of
flanders
and
alençon
came
on
the
compact
masses
of
dismounted
cavalry
who
covered
the
wings
of
the
archery
their
progress
was
at
an
end
they
fell
before
the
line
of
lances
which
they
were
unable
to
break
and
fared
no
better
than
their
comrades
in
the
centre
at
evening
the
french
fell
back
in
disorder
and
their
whole
army
dispersed
the
english
had
won
the
day
without
stirring
a
foot
from
their
position
the
enemy
had
come
to
them
to
be
killed
considerably
more
than
a
third
of
his
numbers
lay
dead
in
front
of
the
english
line
and
of
these
far
the
greater
number
had
fallen
by
the
arrows
of
the
bowmen
creçy
had
proved
that
the
archer
when
adequately
supported
on
his
flanks
could
beat
off
the
charges
of
cavalry
the
moral
however
which
was
drawn
from
it
by
the
french
was
one
of
a
different
kind
unwilling
in
the
bitterness
of
their
to
ascribe
the
victory
to
the
arms
of
mere
peasants
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
due
to
the
stability
of
the
phalanx
of
dismounted
knights
bearing
this
in
mind
king
john
at
the
battle
of
poictiers
resolved
to
imitate
the
successful
expedient
of
king
edward
he
commanded
the
whole
of
his
cavalry
with
the
exception
of
two
corps
to
shorten
their
spears
take
off
their
spurs
and
send
their
horses
to
the
rear
he
had
failed
to
observe
that
the
circumstances
of
attack
and
defence
are
absolutely
different
troops
who
intend
to
root
themselves
to
a
given
spot
of
ground
adopt
tactics
the
very
opposite
of
those
required
for
an
assault
on
a
strong
position
the
device
which
was
well
chosen
for
the
protection
of
edward
s
flanks
at
creçy
was
ludicrous
when
adopted
as
a
means
for
storming
the
hill
of
maupertuis
vigorous
impact
and
not
stability
was
the
quality
at
which
the
king
should
have
aimed
nothing
indeed
could
have
been
more
fatal
than
john
s
conduct
throughout
the
day
the
battle
itself
was
most
unnecessary
since
the
black
prince
could
have
been
starved
into
surrender
in
less
than
a
week
if
however
fighting
was
to
take
place
it
was
absolutely
insane
to
form
the
whole
french
army
into
a
gigantic
wedge
where
corps
after
corps
was
massed
behind
the
first
and
narrowest
line
and
to
dash
it
against
the
strongest
point
of
the
english
front
this
however
was
the
plan
which
the
king
determined
to
adopt
the
only
access
to
the
plateau
of
maupertuis
lay
up
a
lane
along
whose
banks
the
english
archers
were
posted
in
hundreds
through
this
opening
john
thrust
his
vanguard
a
chosen
body
of
horsemen
while
the
rest
of
his
forces
three
great
masses
of
dismounted
cavalry
followed
close
behind
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
archers
shot
down
the
greater
part
of
the
advanced
corps
and
sent
the
survivors
reeling
back
against
the
first
battle
in
their
rear
this
at
once
fell
into
disorder
which
was
largely
increased
when
the
archers
proceeded
to
concentrate
their
attention
on
its
ranks
before
a
blow
had
been
struck
at
close
quarters
the
french
were
growing
demoralized
under
the
shower
of
arrows
seeing
his
opportunity
the
prince
at
once
came
down
from
the
plateau
and
fell
on
the
front
of
the
shaken
column
with
all
his
at
the
same
moment
a
small
ambuscade
of
men
which
he
had
placed
in
a
wood
to
the
left
appeared
on
the
french
flank
this
was
too
much
for
king
john
s
men
without
waiting
for
further
attacks
about
of
them
left
the
field
a
corps
of
germans
in
the
second
battle
and
the
troops
immediately
around
the
monarch
s
person
were
the
only
portions
of
the
army
which
made
a
creditable
resistance
the
english
however
were
able
to
surround
these
bodies
at
their
leisure
and
ply
bow
and
lance
alternately
against
them
till
they
broke
up
then
john
his
son
philip
and
such
of
his
nobles
as
had
remained
with
him
were
forced
to
surrender
this
was
a
splendid
tactical
triumph
for
the
prince
who
secured
the
victory
by
the
excellence
of
the
position
he
had
chosen
and
the
judicious
use
made
of
his
archery
john
s
new
device
for
attacking
an
english
army
had
failed
with
far
greater
ignominy
than
had
attended
the
rout
of
his
predecessor
s
feudal
chivalry
at
creçy
so
greatly
did
the
result
of
the
day
of
poictiers
affect
the
french
mind
that
no
further
attempt
was
made
to
meet
the
invader
in
a
pitched
battle
during
the
continuance
of
the
war
confounded
at
the
blow
which
had
been
delivered
against
their
old
military
system
the
noblesse
of
france
foreswore
the
open
field
and
sullenly
shut
themselves
up
in
their
castles
resolved
to
confine
their
operations
to
petty
sieges
and
incursions
the
english
might
march
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
as
did
the
earl
of
lancaster
in
but
they
could
no
longer
draw
their
opponents
out
to
fight
intrenched
behind
walls
which
the
invader
had
no
leisure
to
attack
the
french
allowed
him
to
waste
his
strength
in
toilsome
marches
through
a
deserted
country
opposed
as
was
this
form
of
war
to
all
the
precepts
of
chivalry
which
bid
the
good
knight
to
accept
every
challenge
they
were
on
the
whole
well
suited
to
the
exigencies
of
the
time
the
tactics
of
charles
v
and
du
guesclin
won
back
all
that
those
of
king
john
had
lost
the
english
found
that
the
war
was
no
longer
a
means
of
displaying
great
feats
of
arms
but
a
monotonous
and
inglorious
occupation
which
involved
a
constant
drain
of
blood
and
money
and
no
longer
maintained
itself
from
the
resources
of
the
enemy
common
sense
and
not
aphorisms
drawn
from
the
customs
of
the
tournament
guided
the
campaigns
of
du
guesclin
he
took
the
field
not
in
the
spirit
of
adventure
but
in
the
spirit
of
business
his
end
being
to
edge
and
worry
the
english
out
of
france
he
did
not
care
whether
that
consummation
was
accomplished
by
showy
exploits
or
by
unobtrusive
hard
work
he
would
fight
if
necessary
but
was
just
as
ready
to
reach
his
goal
by
craft
as
by
hard
blows
night
surprises
ambuscades
and
stratagems
of
every
description
were
his
choice
in
preference
to
open
attacks
provided
with
a
continual
supply
of
men
by
his
free
companies
he
was
never
obliged
to
hazard
an
engagement
for
fear
that
his
forces
might
melt
away
without
having
done
any
service
this
relieved
him
from
that
necessity
to
hurry
operations
which
had
been
fatal
to
so
many
generals
commanding
the
temporary
hosts
of
feudalism
the
english
were
better
fitted
for
winning
great
battles
than
for
carrying
on
a
series
of
harassing
campaigns
tactics
not
strategy
was
their
forte
and
a
succession
of
petty
sieges
and
inglorious
retreats
put
an
end
to
their
attempt
to
hold
by
force
a
foreign
dominion
beyond
the
channel
du
guesclin
however
had
only
cleared
the
way
for
the
of
the
french
noblesse
on
the
field
shut
up
in
their
castles
while
the
free
companies
were
the
country
they
had
apparently
forgotten
nothing
and
remembered
nothing
with
the
fear
of
the
english
no
longer
before
their
eyes
they
at
once
reverted
to
their
old
chivalrous
superstitions
the
last
years
of
the
century
were
similar
to
the
first
if
cassel
reproduced
itself
at
rosbecque
a
nemesis
awaited
the
revived
tactics
of
feudalism
and
nicopolis
was
a
more
disastrous
edition
of
courtray
thirty
years
of
anarchy
during
the
reign
of
an
imbecile
king
fostered
the
reactionary
and
unscientific
tendency
of
the
wars
of
the
time
and
made
france
a
fit
prey
to
a
new
series
of
english
invasions
if
subsequent
campaigns
had
not
proved
that
henry
v
was
a
master
of
strategical
combinations
we
should
be
inclined
to
pronounce
his
march
to
agincourt
a
rash
and
unjustifiable
undertaking
it
is
however
probable
that
he
had
taken
the
measure
of
his
enemies
and
gauged
their
imbecility
before
he
sacrificed
his
communications
and
threw
himself
into
picardy
the
rapidity
of
his
movements
between
the
and
of
october
shows
that
he
had
that
appreciation
of
the
value
of
time
which
was
so
rare
among
mediæval
commanders
while
the
perfect
organization
of
his
columns
on
the
march
proved
that
his
genius
could
condescend
to
details
near
pol
the
french
barred
henry
s
further
progress
with
a
great
feudal
army
of
sixty
thousand
combatants
of
whom
full
fifteen
thousand
were
mounted
men
of
gentle
blood
like
the
two
edwards
at
creçy
and
maupertuis
the
king
resolved
to
fight
a
defensive
battle
in
spite
of
the
scantiness
of
his
force
he
had
with
him
not
more
than
fourteen
thousand
men
of
whom
were
archers
the
position
chosen
by
henry
was
as
excellent
in
its
way
as
could
be
desired
it
had
a
frontage
of
not
more
than
twelve
hundred
yards
and
was
covered
by
woods
on
either
flank
the
land
over
which
the
enemy
would
have
to
advance
consisted
of
ploughed
fields
thoroughly
sodden
by
a
week
of
rain
the
king
s
archers
were
sufficient
in
number
not
only
to
furnish
a
double
line
along
the
front
of
the
army
but
to
occupy
the
woods
to
right
and
left
those
in
the
plain
strengthened
their
position
by
planting
in
front
of
themselves
the
stakes
which
they
habitually
carried
in
rear
of
the
archers
were
disposed
the
rest
of
the
force
the
infantry
with
bills
and
pikes
at
the
wings
the
small
force
of
in
the
centre
the
constable
of
france
committed
as
many
faults
in
drawing
up
his
array
as
could
have
been
expected
from
an
average
feudal
nobleman
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
following
the
example
set
him
by
king
john
at
poictiers
and
therefore
dismounted
of
his
cavalry
these
he
drew
up
in
two
deep
battles
flanked
by
small
squadrons
of
mounted
men
behind
the
first
line
where
it
could
be
of
no
possible
use
was
stationed
a
corps
of
the
reserve
was
formed
by
a
great
mass
of
infantry
who
were
relegated
to
the
rear
lest
they
should
dispute
the
honour
of
the
day
with
their
masters
at
eleven
o
clock
the
french
began
to
move
towards
the
english
position
presently
they
passed
the
village
of
agincourt
and
found
themselves
between
the
woods
and
in
the
ploughed
land
struggling
on
for
a
few
hundred
yards
they
began
to
sink
in
the
deep
clay
of
the
fields
horsemen
and
dismounted
knight
alike
found
their
pace
growing
slower
and
slower
by
this
time
the
english
archery
was
commencing
to
play
upon
them
first
from
the
front
then
from
the
troops
concealed
in
the
woods
also
pulling
themselves
together
as
best
they
could
the
french
lurched
heavily
on
sinking
to
the
ankle
or
even
to
the
knee
in
the
sodden
soil
not
one
in
ten
of
the
horsemen
ever
reached
the
line
of
stakes
and
of
the
infantry
not
a
man
struggled
on
so
far
stuck
fast
in
the
mud
they
stood
as
a
target
for
the
bowmen
at
a
distance
of
from
fifty
to
a
hundred
yards
from
the
english
front
after
remaining
for
a
short
time
in
this
unenviable
position
they
broke
and
turned
to
the
rear
then
the
whole
english
army
archers
and
alike
left
their
position
and
charged
down
on
the
mass
as
it
staggered
slowly
back
towards
the
second
perfectly
helpless
and
up
to
their
knees
in
mire
the
exhausted
knights
were
cast
down
or
constrained
to
surrender
to
the
lighter
troops
who
poured
among
them
beating
upon
the
armour
as
though
they
were
hammering
upon
the
few
who
contrived
to
escape
and
the
body
of
arbalesters
who
had
formed
the
rear
of
the
first
line
ran
in
upon
the
second
battle
which
was
now
well
engaged
in
the
miry
fields
just
beyond
agincourt
village
and
threw
it
into
disorder
close
in
their
rear
the
english
followed
came
down
upon
the
second
mass
and
inflicted
upon
it
the
fate
which
had
befallen
the
first
the
very
wisely
resolved
not
to
meddle
with
their
masters
business
and
quietly
withdrew
from
the
field
few
commanders
could
have
committed
a
more
glaring
series
of
blunders
than
did
the
constable
but
the
chief
fault
of
his
design
lay
in
attempting
to
attack
an
english
army
established
in
a
good
position
at
all
the
power
of
the
bow
was
such
that
not
even
if
the
fields
had
been
dry
could
the
french
army
have
succeeded
in
forcing
the
english
line
the
true
course
here
as
at
poictiers
would
have
been
to
have
starved
the
king
who
was
living
merely
on
the
resources
of
the
neighbourhood
out
of
his
position
if
however
an
attack
was
projected
it
should
have
been
accompanied
by
a
turning
movement
round
the
woods
and
preceded
by
the
use
of
all
the
arbalesters
and
archers
of
the
army
a
force
which
we
know
to
have
consisted
of
men
such
a
day
as
agincourt
might
have
been
expected
to
break
the
french
noblesse
of
its
love
for
an
obsolete
system
of
tactics
so
intimately
however
was
the
feudal
array
bound
up
with
the
feudal
scheme
of
society
that
it
yet
remained
the
ideal
order
of
battle
three
bloody
defeats
crevant
verneuil
and
the
day
of
the
herrings
were
the
consequences
of
a
fanatical
adherence
to
the
old
method
of
fighting
on
each
of
those
occasions
the
french
columns
sometimes
composed
of
horsemen
sometimes
of
dismounted
knights
made
a
desperate
attempt
to
break
an
english
line
of
archers
by
a
front
attack
and
on
each
occasion
they
were
driven
back
in
utter
rout
it
was
not
till
the
conduct
of
the
war
fell
into
the
hands
of
professional
soldiers
like
xaintrailles
la
hire
and
dunois
that
these
insane
tactics
were
discarded
their
abandonment
however
was
only
the
first
step
towards
success
for
the
french
the
position
of
the
country
was
infinitely
worse
than
it
had
been
in
the
days
of
du
guesclin
since
the
greater
part
of
the
districts
north
of
the
loire
were
not
only
occupied
by
the
english
but
had
resigned
themselves
to
their
fate
and
showed
no
desire
to
join
the
national
party
a
petty
warfare
such
as
had
won
back
the
lands
of
acquitaine
from
the
black
prince
would
have
been
totally
inadequate
to
rescue
france
in
it
is
on
this
ground
that
we
must
base
the
importance
of
the
influence
of
the
maid
of
orleans
her
successes
represent
not
a
new
tactical
system
but
the
awakening
of
a
popular
enthusiasm
which
was
to
make
the
further
stay
of
the
english
in
france
impossible
the
smaller
country
could
not
hold
down
the
larger
unless
the
population
of
the
latter
were
supine
when
they
ceased
to
be
so
the
undertaking
in
spite
of
all
military
superiority
became
impossible
while
ascribing
the
expulsion
of
the
english
from
france
to
political
rather
than
strategical
reasons
we
must
not
forget
that
the
professional
officers
of
the
fifteenth
century
had
at
last
discovered
a
method
of
minimizing
the
ascendancy
of
the
english
soldiery
when
they
found
the
invaders
drawn
up
in
a
good
defensive
position
they
invariably
refrained
from
attacking
them
there
was
no
object
in
making
the
troops
a
target
to
be
riddled
with
arrows
when
success
was
almost
impossible
accordingly
the
french
victories
of
the
second
quarter
of
the
century
will
be
found
to
have
resulted
in
most
cases
from
attacking
an
english
army
at
a
moment
when
it
was
on
the
march
or
in
some
other
position
which
rendered
it
impossible
for
an
order
of
battle
to
be
rapidly
formed
patay
is
a
fair
example
of
a
conflict
of
this
description
the
battle
was
lost
because
talbot
when
attacked
was
not
immediately
ready
expecting
to
see
the
whole
french
army
arrive
on
the
field
and
draw
itself
up
in
battle
array
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
mere
vanguard
which
was
before
him
and
commenced
falling
back
on
the
village
of
patay
where
he
intended
to
form
his
line
la
hire
however
without
waiting
for
the
to
come
up
attacked
the
retreating
columns
and
forced
his
way
among
them
before
the
archers
had
time
to
fix
their
stakes
the
superiority
of
the
bow
to
the
lance
depended
on
the
ability
of
the
bearer
of
the
missile
weapon
to
keep
his
enemy
at
a
distance
if
once
by
any
accident
the
cavalry
got
among
their
opponents
a
mere
ensued
and
numbers
and
weight
carried
the
day
such
was
the
case
on
this
occasion
la
hire
having
succeeded
in
closing
the
battle
resolved
itself
into
a
struggle
and
when
the
of
the
french
came
up
the
english
were
overpowered
by
numerical
superiority
such
were
the
usual
tactical
causes
of
english
defeats
in
the
fifteenth
century
the
fall
of
the
empire
which
henry
v
had
established
in
france
was
therefore
due
from
the
military
point
of
view
to
the
inadequacy
of
a
purely
defensive
system
to
meet
all
the
vicissitudes
of
a
series
of
campaigns
the
commanders
who
had
received
the
tradition
of
agincourt
and
poictiers
disliked
assuming
the
offensive
accustomed
to
win
success
by
receiving
the
enemy
s
attack
on
a
carefully
chosen
ground
and
after
deliberate
preparations
they
frequently
failed
when
opposed
to
officers
who
refrained
on
principle
from
assailing
a
position
but
were
continually
appearing
when
least
expected
in
the
open
field
or
on
the
march
in
camp
or
the
town
the
english
were
always
liable
to
a
sudden
onslaught
they
were
too
good
soldiers
to
be
demoralized
but
lost
the
old
confidence
which
had
distinguished
them
in
the
days
when
the
french
still
persisted
in
keeping
up
their
ancient
feudal
tactics
a
fortunate
chance
has
preserved
for
us
in
the
pages
of
blondel
s
reductio
normanniae
a
full
account
of
the
disastrous
field
of
formigny
the
last
battle
but
one
fought
by
the
english
in
their
attempt
to
hold
down
their
dominion
beyond
the
channel
the
narrative
is
most
instructive
as
explaining
the
changes
of
fortune
during
the
later
years
of
the
great
war
the
fight
itself
though
destined
to
decide
the
fate
of
all
normandy
was
an
engagement
on
a
very
small
scale
some
five
thousand
english
half
of
them
archers
the
remainder
billmen
for
the
most
part
with
a
few
hundred
had
been
collected
for
a
desperate
attempt
to
open
the
way
to
caen
in
that
town
the
duke
of
somerset
commander
of
all
the
english
armies
in
france
was
threatened
by
an
overwhelming
host
led
by
king
charles
in
person
to
draw
together
a
force
capable
of
taking
the
field
all
the
norman
fortresses
had
been
stripped
of
their
garrisons
and
such
reinforcements
as
could
be
procured
some
men
at
most
had
been
brought
across
from
england
the
relieving
army
succeeded
in
taking
valognes
and
forcing
the
dangerous
fords
of
the
douve
and
vire
but
hard
by
the
village
of
formigny
it
was
confronted
by
a
french
corps
under
the
count
of
clermont
one
of
several
divisions
which
had
been
sent
out
to
arrest
the
march
of
the
english
clermont
s
troops
did
not
greatly
exceed
their
enemies
in
number
they
appear
as
far
as
conflicting
accounts
allow
us
to
judge
to
have
consisted
of
six
hundred
lances
garnis
cavalry
and
three
thousand
infantry
the
obligation
to
take
the
offensive
rested
with
the
english
who
were
bound
to
force
their
way
to
caen
nevertheless
sir
thomas
kyriel
and
sir
matthew
gough
the
two
veterans
who
commanded
the
relieving
army
refused
to
assume
the
initiative
the
old
prejudice
in
favour
of
fighting
defensive
battles
was
so
strong
that
forgetting
the
object
of
their
expedition
they
fell
back
and
looked
for
a
position
in
which
to
receive
the
attack
of
clermont
s
troops
finding
a
brook
lined
with
orchards
and
plantations
which
was
well
calculated
to
cover
their
rear
they
halted
in
front
of
it
and
drew
up
their
men
in
a
convex
line
the
centre
projecting
the
wings
drawn
back
so
as
to
touch
the
stream
three
bodies
of
archers
each
seven
hundred
strong
formed
the
on
the
flanks
of
this
force
were
stationed
two
battles
of
billmen
not
in
a
line
with
the
centre
but
drawn
back
from
it
while
these
corps
were
themselves
flanked
by
the
small
force
of
cavalry
which
was
formed
close
in
front
of
the
orchards
and
the
brook
clermont
did
not
attack
immediately
so
that
the
archers
had
ample
time
to
fix
their
stakes
according
to
their
invariable
custom
and
the
whole
force
was
beginning
to
cover
itself
with
a
trench
when
the
enemy
at
last
began
to
move
through
long
experience
the
french
had
grown
too
wary
to
attack
an
english
line
of
archers
from
the
front
after
feeling
the
position
they
tried
several
partial
assaults
on
the
flanks
which
were
repulsed
skirmishing
had
been
going
on
for
three
hours
without
any
decisive
result
when
giraud
master
of
the
royal
ordnance
brought
up
two
culverins
and
placed
them
in
a
spot
from
which
they
enfiladed
the
english
line
galled
by
the
fire
of
these
pieces
part
of
the
archers
rushed
out
from
behind
their
stakes
and
with
the
aid
of
one
of
the
wings
of
billmen
charged
the
french
seized
the
culverins
and
routed
the
troops
which
protected
them
if
the
whole
of
kyriel
s
force
had
advanced
at
this
moment
the
battle
would
have
been
won
but
the
english
commander
adhered
rigidly
to
his
defensive
tactics
and
while
he
waited
motionless
the
fate
of
the
battle
was
changed
the
troops
who
had
charged
were
attacked
by
one
of
the
flank
battles
of
french
who
had
dismounted
and
advanced
to
win
back
the
lost
cannon
a
desperate
fight
took
place
while
the
english
strove
to
drag
the
pieces
towards
their
lines
and
the
enemy
to
recapture
them
at
last
the
french
prevailed
and
pushing
the
retreating
body
before
them
reached
the
english
position
the
archers
were
unable
to
use
their
arrows
so
closely
were
friend
and
foe
intermixed
in
the
crowd
of
combatants
which
slowly
rolled
back
towards
them
thus
the
two
armies
met
all
along
the
line
in
a
combat
and
a
sanguinary
began
the
fate
of
the
battle
was
still
doubtful
when
a
new
french
force
arrived
in
the
field
the
counts
of
richemont
and
laval
coming
up
from
st
lo
appeared
on
the
rear
of
the
english
position
with
all
kyriel
s
troops
were
engaged
and
he
was
unable
to
meet
this
new
attack
his
men
recoiled
to
the
brook
at
their
backs
and
were
at
once
broken
into
several
isolated
corps
gough
cut
his
way
through
the
french
and
reached
bayeux
with
the
cavalry
but
kyriel
and
the
infantry
were
surrounded
and
the
whole
was
annihilated
a
few
hundred
archers
escaped
and
their
commander
with
some
scores
more
was
taken
prisoner
but
the
french
gave
little
quarter
and
their
heralds
counted
next
day
three
thousand
seven
hundred
and
english
corpses
lying
on
the
field
seldom
has
an
army
suffered
such
a
complete
disaster
of
kyriel
s
small
force
not
less
than
was
destroyed
what
number
of
the
french
fell
we
are
unable
to
ascertain
their
annalists
speak
of
the
death
of
twelve
knights
none
of
them
men
of
note
but
make
no
further
mention
of
their
losses
they
declare
what
number
they
slew
sarcastically
observes
an
english
chronicler
but
they
write
not
how
many
of
themselves
were
slain
and
destroyed
this
was
well
nigh
the
first
foughten
field
they
gat
on
the
english
wherefore
i
blame
them
not
though
they
of
a
little
make
much
and
set
forth
all
and
hide
nothing
that
may
sound
to
their
the
moral
of
formigny
was
evident
an
unintelligent
application
of
the
defensive
tactics
of
edward
iii
and
henry
v
could
only
lead
to
disaster
when
the
french
had
improved
in
military
skill
and
were
no
longer
accustomed
to
make
gross
blunders
at
every
engagement
unless
some
new
method
of
dealing
with
the
superior
numbers
and
cautious
manœuvres
of
the
disciplined
compagnies
d
ordonnance
of
charles
vii
could
be
devised
the
english
were
foredoomed
by
their
numerical
inferiority
to
defeat
it
was
probably
a
perception
of
this
fact
which
induced
the
great
talbot
to
discard
his
old
tactics
and
employ
at
his
last
fight
a
method
of
attack
totally
unlike
that
practised
in
the
rest
of
the
hundred
years
war
the
accounts
of
the
battle
of
chatillon
recall
the
warfare
of
the
swiss
rather
than
of
the
english
armies
that
engagement
was
a
desperate
attempt
of
a
column
of
dismounted
and
billmen
flanked
by
archers
to
storm
an
intrenched
camp
protected
by
artillery
the
english
like
the
swiss
at
bicocca
found
the
task
too
hard
for
them
and
only
increased
the
disaster
by
their
gallant
persistence
in
attempting
to
accomplish
the
impossible
the
expulsion
of
the
english
from
their
continental
possessions
had
no
permanent
effect
in
discrediting
the
power
of
the
bow
the
weapon
still
retained
its
supremacy
as
a
missile
over
the
clumsy
arbalest
with
its
complicated
array
of
wheels
and
levers
it
was
hardly
less
superior
to
the
and
arquebuses
which
did
not
attain
to
any
great
degree
of
efficiency
before
the
end
of
the
century
the
testimony
of
all
europe
was
given
in
favour
of
the
charles
of
burgundy
considered
a
corps
of
three
thousand
english
bowmen
the
flower
of
his
infantry
charles
of
france
thirty
years
earlier
had
made
the
archer
the
basis
of
his
new
militia
in
a
vain
attempt
to
naturalize
the
weapon
of
his
enemies
beyond
the
channel
james
of
scotland
after
a
similar
endeavour
had
resigned
himself
to
ill
success
and
turned
the
archery
of
his
subjects
to
ridicule
there
are
few
periods
which
appear
more
likely
to
present
to
the
enquirer
a
series
of
interesting
military
problems
than
the
years
of
the
great
struggle
in
which
the
national
weapons
and
national
tactics
of
the
english
were
turned
against
each
other
the
wars
of
the
roses
were
however
unfortunate
in
their
historians
the
dearth
of
exact
information
concerning
the
various
engagements
is
remarkable
when
we
consider
the
ample
materials
which
are
to
be
found
for
the
history
of
the
preceding
periods
the
meagre
annals
of
william
of
worcester
warkworth
fabyan
of
the
continuer
of
the
croyland
chronicle
and
the
author
of
the
arrival
of
king
edward
iv
with
the
ignorant
generalities
of
whethamstede
are
insufficiently
supplemented
by
the
later
works
of
grafton
and
hall
when
all
has
been
collated
we
still
fail
to
grasp
the
details
of
most
of
the
battles
not
in
one
single
instance
can
we
reconstruct
the
exact
array
of
a
yorkist
or
a
lancastrian
army
enough
however
survives
to
make
us
regret
the
scantiness
of
the
sources
of
our
information
that
some
considerable
amount
of
tactical
and
strategical
skill
was
employed
by
many
of
the
english
commanders
is
evident
when
we
analyse
the
general
characteristics
of
their
campaigns
the
engagements
show
no
stereotyped
similarity
of
incident
such
as
would
have
resulted
from
a
general
adherence
to
a
single
form
of
attack
or
defence
each
combat
had
its
own
individuality
resulting
from
the
particular
tactics
employed
in
it
the
fierce
which
is
known
as
the
first
battle
of
albans
has
nothing
in
common
with
the
irregular
skirmishing
of
hedgeley
moor
the
stormings
of
the
fortified
positions
of
northampton
and
tewkesbury
bear
no
resemblance
to
the
pitched
battles
of
towton
and
barnet
the
superiority
of
tactics
which
won
bloreheath
contrasts
with
the
superiority
of
armament
which
won
edgecot
field
prominent
among
the
features
of
the
war
stands
out
the
generalship
of
king
edward
iv
already
a
skilful
commander
in
his
nineteenth
year
it
was
he
who
at
northampton
turned
the
lancastrian
position
by
forcing
the
streight
places
which
covered
the
flank
of
the
line
of
high
banks
and
deep
trenches
behind
which
the
army
of
king
henry
was
sheltered
a
year
later
he
saved
a
cause
which
seemed
desperate
by
his
rapid
march
from
hereford
to
london
a
march
executed
in
the
inclement
month
of
february
and
over
the
miry
roads
of
the
counties
the
decision
of
mind
which
led
him
to
attempt
at
all
hazards
to
throw
himself
into
the
capital
won
him
his
crown
and
turned
the
balance
at
the
decisive
crisis
of
the
war
if
when
settled
on
the
throne
he
imperilled
his
position
by
carelessness
and
presumption
he
was
himself
again
at
the
first
blast
of
the
trumpet
his
vigorous
struggle
in
the
spring
of
when
all
around
him
were
showing
themselves
traitors
was
a
wonderful
example
of
the
success
of
prompt
action
nor
was
his
genius
less
marked
in
his
last
great
military
success
the
campaign
of
barnet
and
tewkesbury
to
have
marched
from
york
to
london
threading
his
way
among
the
hosts
of
his
foes
without
disaster
was
a
skilful
achievement
even
if
the
treachery
of
some
of
the
hostile
commanders
be
taken
into
consideration
at
barnet
he
showed
that
tactics
no
less
than
strategy
lay
within
the
compass
of
his
powers
by
turning
the
casual
circumstance
of
the
fog
entirely
to
his
own
profit
the
unforeseen
chance
by
which
each
army
outflanked
the
other
was
not
in
itself
more
favourable
to
one
party
than
to
the
other
it
merely
tested
the
relative
ability
of
the
two
leaders
but
edward
s
care
in
providing
a
reserve
rendered
the
defeat
of
his
left
wing
unimportant
while
the
similar
disaster
on
warwick
s
left
was
turned
to
such
good
account
that
it
decided
the
day
warwick
himself
indeed
if
we
investigate
his
whole
career
leaves
on
us
the
impression
rather
of
the
political
le
plus
subtil
homme
de
son
vivant
as
commines
called
him
than
of
the
great
military
figure
of
traditional
accounts
barnet
being
won
the
second
half
of
the
campaign
began
with
edward
s
march
to
intercept
queen
margaret
before
she
could
open
communications
with
her
friends
in
south
wales
gloucester
was
held
for
the
king
his
enemies
therefore
as
they
marched
north
were
compelled
to
make
for
tewkesbury
the
first
crossing
on
the
severn
which
was
passable
for
them
the
lancastrian
feint
on
chipping
sodbury
was
not
but
edward
rendered
its
effect
nugatory
by
his
rapid
movements
both
armies
gathered
themselves
up
for
a
rush
towards
the
passage
but
the
king
although
he
had
the
longer
distance
to
cover
and
was
toiling
over
the
barren
rolling
country
of
the
cotswold
plateau
his
opponents
men
spoke
with
surprise
of
the
miles
which
his
army
accomplished
in
the
day
without
halting
for
a
meal
and
in
a
district
where
water
was
so
scarce
that
the
men
were
able
to
quench
their
thirst
only
once
in
the
twelve
hours
by
evening
the
king
was
within
five
miles
of
the
lancastrians
who
had
halted
utterly
worn
out
in
the
town
of
tewkesbury
as
they
had
not
succeeded
in
crossing
its
ferry
that
night
they
were
compelled
to
fight
next
day
since
there
was
even
greater
danger
in
being
attacked
while
their
forces
were
half
across
the
severn
and
half
still
on
the
gloucestershire
side
than
in
turning
to
meet
the
king
queen
margaret
s
generals
therefore
drew
up
their
forces
on
the
rising
ground
to
the
south
of
the
town
in
a
good
position
where
they
had
the
slope
of
the
hill
in
their
favour
and
were
well
protected
by
hedges
and
high
banks
edward
however
made
no
rash
attempts
to
force
his
enemies
line
instead
of
delivering
an
assault
he
brought
up
cannon
and
concentrated
their
fire
on
one
of
the
hostile
wings
somerset
who
commanded
there
was
at
last
so
galled
that
he
came
down
from
his
vantage
ground
to
drive
off
the
gunners
his
charge
was
for
the
moment
successful
but
left
a
fatal
gap
in
the
lancastrian
line
the
centre
making
no
attempt
to
close
this
opening
edward
was
enabled
to
thrust
his
into
it
and
thus
forced
the
position
and
drove
his
enemies
in
complete
disorder
into
the
of
tewkesbury
town
where
they
were
for
the
most
part
compelled
to
surrender
it
will
at
once
be
observed
that
the
king
s
tactics
on
this
occasion
were
precisely
those
which
had
won
for
william
the
norman
the
field
of
senlac
he
repeated
the
experiment
merely
substituting
artillery
for
archery
and
put
his
enemy
in
a
position
where
he
had
either
to
fall
back
or
to
charge
in
order
to
escape
the
yorkist
missiles
king
edward
was
by
no
means
the
only
commander
of
merit
whom
the
war
revealed
we
should
be
inclined
to
rate
the
earl
of
salisbury
s
ability
high
after
considering
his
manœuvre
at
bloreheath
being
at
the
head
of
inferior
forces
he
retired
for
some
time
before
lord
audley
till
continued
retreat
having
made
his
adversary
careless
he
suddenly
turned
on
him
while
his
forces
were
divided
by
a
stream
and
inflicted
two
crushing
blows
on
the
two
isolated
halves
of
the
lancastrian
army
the
operations
before
towton
also
seem
to
show
the
existence
of
considerable
enterprise
and
alertness
on
both
sides
clifford
was
successful
in
his
bold
attempt
to
beat
up
the
camp
and
rout
the
division
of
fitzwalter
but
on
the
other
hand
falconbridge
was
sufficiently
prompt
to
fall
upon
the
victorious
clifford
as
he
returned
towards
his
and
to
efface
the
yorkist
disaster
of
the
early
morning
by
a
success
in
the
afternoon
the
same
falconbridge
gave
in
the
great
battle
of
the
ensuing
day
an
example
of
the
kind
of
tactical
expedients
which
sufficed
to
decide
the
day
when
both
armies
were
employing
the
same
great
weapon
a
rendered
the
opposing
lines
only
partially
visible
to
each
other
he
therefore
ordered
his
men
to
advance
barely
within
extreme
range
and
let
fly
a
volley
of
the
light
and
after
which
he
halted
the
lancastrians
finding
the
shafts
falling
among
them
drew
the
natural
conclusion
that
their
enemies
were
well
within
range
and
answered
with
a
continuous
discharge
of
their
heavier
which
fell
short
of
the
yorkists
by
sixty
yards
half
an
hour
of
this
work
exhausted
their
store
of
missiles
so
that
the
billmen
and
of
warwick
and
king
edward
were
then
able
to
advance
without
receiving
any
appreciable
damage
from
the
lancastrian
archery
a
stratagem
like
this
could
only
be
used
when
the
adversaries
were
perfectly
conversant
with
each
other
s
armament
and
methods
of
war
in
this
respect
it
may
remind
us
of
the
device
employed
by
the
romans
against
their
former
of
the
latin
league
at
the
battle
of
vesuvius
that
the
practice
of
dismounting
large
bodies
of
which
was
so
prevalent
on
the
continent
in
this
century
was
not
unknown
in
england
we
have
ample
evidence
the
lancastrian
loss
at
northampton
we
are
told
was
excessive
because
the
knights
had
sent
their
horses
to
the
rear
and
could
not
escape
similarly
we
hear
of
warwick
dismounting
to
lead
a
charge
at
towton
and
again
but
on
less
certain
authority
at
barnet
this
custom
explains
the
importance
of
the
in
the
knightly
equipment
of
the
fifteenth
century
it
was
the
weapon
specially
used
by
the
horsemen
who
had
descended
to
fight
on
foot
instances
of
its
use
in
this
way
need
not
be
multiplied
we
may
however
mention
the
incident
which
of
all
others
seems
most
to
have
impressed
the
chroniclers
in
the
fight
of
sir
richard
herbert
valiantly
acquitted
himself
in
that
on
foot
and
with
his
in
his
hand
he
twice
by
main
force
passed
through
the
battle
of
his
adversaries
and
without
any
mortal
wound
the
engagement
at
which
this
feat
of
arms
was
performed
was
one
notable
as
a
renewed
attempt
of
spearmen
to
stand
against
a
mixed
force
of
archers
and
cavalry
the
yorkists
were
utterly
destitute
of
light
troops
their
bowmen
having
been
drawn
off
by
their
commander
lord
stafford
in
a
fit
of
pique
so
that
pembroke
and
his
north
welsh
troops
were
left
unsupported
the
natural
result
followed
in
spite
of
the
strong
position
of
the
king
s
men
the
rebels
by
force
of
archery
caused
them
quickly
to
descend
from
the
hill
into
the
valley
where
they
were
ridden
down
as
they
retreated
in
disorder
by
the
northern
horse
throughout
the
whole
of
the
war
artillery
was
in
common
use
by
both
parties
its
employment
was
decisive
at
the
fights
of
tewkesbury
and
we
also
hear
of
it
at
barnet
and
northampton
as
also
in
the
sieges
of
the
northern
fortresses
in
its
efficiency
was
recognised
far
more
than
that
of
smaller
of
which
we
find
very
scant
mention
the
still
retained
its
supremacy
over
the
arquebus
and
had
yet
famous
fields
to
win
notably
that
of
flodden
where
the
old
manœuvres
of
falkirk
were
repeated
by
both
parties
and
the
pikemen
of
the
lowlands
were
once
more
shot
down
by
the
archers
of
cheshire
and
lancashire
as
late
as
the
reign
of
edward
vi
we
find
kett
s
insurgents
beating
by
the
rapidity
of
their
a
corps
of
german
whom
the
government
had
sent
against
them
nor
was
the
bow
entirely
extinct
as
a
national
weapon
even
in
the
days
of
queen
elizabeth
further
however
than
the
end
of
the
great
english
civil
war
of
the
fifteenth
century
it
is
not
our
task
to
trace
its
use
the
direct
influence
of
english
methods
of
warfare
on
the
general
current
of
european
military
science
ends
with
the
final
loss
of
dominion
in
france
in
the
years
from
that
period
the
occasions
of
contact
which
had
once
been
so
frequent
become
rare
and
unimportant
the
wars
of
the
roses
kept
the
english
soldier
at
home
and
after
their
end
the
pacific
policy
of
henry
vii
tended
to
the
same
result
henry
viii
exerted
an
influence
on
continental
politics
by
diplomacy
and
subsidies
rather
than
by
his
barren
and
infrequent
expeditions
while
in
the
second
half
of
the
century
the
peculiar
characteristics
of
the
english
army
of
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
century
had
passed
away
in
the
general
change
and
transformation
of
the
forms
of
the
art
of
war
vii
conclusion
we
have
now
discussed
at
length
the
two
systems
of
tactics
which
played
the
chief
part
in
revolutionising
the
art
of
war
in
europe
the
one
has
been
traced
from
morgarten
to
bicocca
the
other
from
falkirk
to
formigny
and
it
has
been
shown
how
the
ascendancy
of
each
was
at
last
checked
by
the
development
of
new
forms
of
military
efficiency
among
those
against
whom
it
was
directed
while
ascribing
to
the
pikemen
of
switzerland
and
the
english
archery
the
chief
part
in
the
overthrow
of
feudal
cavalry
and
to
no
small
extent
in
that
of
feudalism
itself
we
must
not
forget
that
the
same
work
was
simultaneously
being
wrought
out
by
other
methods
in
other
quarters
of
europe
prominent
among
the
experiments
directed
to
this
end
was
that
of
zisca
and
his
captains
in
the
great
hussite
wars
of
the
first
half
of
the
fifteenth
century
in
bohemia
the
new
military
departure
was
the
result
of
social
and
religious
convulsions
a
gallant
nation
had
risen
in
arms
stirred
at
once
by
outraged
patriotism
and
by
spiritual
zeal
moved
by
a
desire
to
drive
the
intruding
german
beyond
the
erzgebirge
but
moved
even
more
by
dreams
of
universal
brotherhood
and
of
a
kingdom
of
righteousness
to
be
established
by
the
sword
all
bohemia
was
ready
to
march
but
still
it
was
not
apparent
how
the
overwhelming
strength
of
germany
was
to
be
met
if
the
fate
of
the
struggle
had
depended
on
the
lances
of
the
tzech
nobility
it
would
have
been
hopeless
they
could
put
into
the
field
only
tens
to
oppose
to
the
thousands
of
german
feudalism
the
undisciplined
masses
of
peasants
and
burghers
who
accompanied
them
would
under
the
old
tactical
arrangements
have
fared
no
better
than
the
infantry
of
flanders
had
fared
at
rosbecque
but
the
problem
of
utilising
those
strong
and
willing
arms
fell
into
the
hands
of
a
man
of
genius
john
zisca
of
trocnov
had
acquired
military
experience
and
hatred
of
germany
while
fighting
in
the
ranks
of
the
poles
against
the
teutonic
knights
he
saw
clearly
that
to
lead
into
the
field
men
wholly
untrained
and
rudely
armed
with
staves
flails
and
scythes
fixed
to
poles
would
be
madness
the
bohemians
had
neither
a
uniform
equipment
nor
a
national
system
of
tactics
their
only
force
lay
in
their
religious
and
national
enthusiasm
which
was
strong
enough
to
make
all
differences
vanish
on
the
day
of
battle
so
that
the
wildest
fanatics
were
content
to
combine
and
to
obey
when
once
the
foe
came
in
sight
it
was
evident
that
the
only
chance
for
the
hussites
was
to
stand
upon
the
defensive
till
they
had
gauged
their
enemies
military
efficiency
and
learnt
to
handle
their
own
arms
accordingly
we
hear
of
intrenchments
being
everywhere
thrown
up
and
towns
being
put
in
a
state
of
defence
during
the
first
months
of
the
war
but
this
was
not
all
in
his
eastern
campaigns
zisca
had
seen
a
military
device
which
he
thought
might
be
developed
and
turned
to
account
there
prevailed
among
the
russians
and
lithuanians
a
custom
of
surrounding
every
encampment
by
a
portable
barricade
of
beams
and
stakes
which
could
be
taken
to
pieces
and
transferred
from
position
to
position
the
russian
princes
habitually
utilised
in
their
wars
such
a
structure
which
they
called
a
goliaigorod
or
moving
fortress
zisca
s
development
of
this
system
consisted
in
substituting
for
the
beams
and
stakes
a
line
of
waggons
at
first
merely
such
as
the
supplied
but
afterwards
constructed
specially
for
military
purposes
and
fitted
with
hooks
and
chains
by
which
they
were
fastened
one
to
another
it
was
evident
that
these
when
once
placed
in
order
would
be
impregnable
to
a
cavalry
charge
however
vigorous
the
impetus
of
the
knight
might
be
it
would
not
carry
him
through
oaken
planks
and
iron
links
the
onset
of
the
german
horseman
being
the
chief
thing
which
the
hussites
had
to
dread
the
battle
was
half
won
when
a
method
of
resisting
it
had
been
devised
with
the
german
infantry
they
were
competent
to
deal
without
any
elaborate
preparation
it
might
be
thought
that
zisca
s
invention
would
have
condemned
the
bohemians
to
adhere
strictly
to
the
defensive
in
the
whole
campaign
as
well
as
in
each
engagement
in
it
this
however
was
not
the
case
when
fully
worked
out
the
system
assumed
a
remarkable
shape
there
was
organized
a
special
corps
of
waggoners
on
whose
efficiency
everything
depended
they
were
continually
drilled
and
taught
to
manœuvre
their
vehicles
with
accuracy
and
promptness
at
the
word
of
command
we
are
told
they
would
form
a
circle
a
square
or
a
triangle
and
then
rapidly
disengage
their
teams
thus
leaving
the
waggons
in
proper
position
and
only
needing
to
be
chained
together
this
done
they
took
up
their
position
in
the
centre
of
the
enclosure
the
organization
of
the
whole
army
was
grounded
on
the
waggon
as
a
unit
to
each
was
told
off
besides
the
driver
a
band
of
about
twenty
men
of
whom
part
were
and
while
the
remainder
were
armed
with
missile
weapons
the
former
ranged
themselves
behind
the
chains
which
joined
waggon
to
waggon
the
latter
stood
in
the
vehicles
and
fired
down
on
the
enemy
from
the
first
zisca
set
himself
to
introduce
among
the
bohemians
at
length
nearly
a
third
of
them
were
armed
with
while
a
strong
train
of
artillery
accompanied
every
force
a
hussite
army
in
movement
had
its
regular
order
of
march
wherever
the
country
was
open
enough
it
formed
five
parallel
columns
in
the
centre
marched
the
cavalry
and
artillery
to
each
side
of
them
two
divisions
of
waggons
accompanied
by
their
complements
of
infantry
the
two
outer
divisions
were
longer
than
the
two
which
marched
next
the
horsemen
and
the
guns
the
latter
were
intended
in
the
case
of
a
sudden
attack
to
form
the
front
and
rear
of
a
great
oblong
of
which
the
longer
divisions
were
to
compose
the
sides
to
enable
the
shorter
columns
to
wheel
one
forward
and
the
other
backward
no
great
time
would
be
required
and
if
the
few
necessary
minutes
were
obtained
the
hussite
order
of
battle
stood
complete
to
such
perfection
and
accuracy
was
the
execution
of
this
manœuvre
brought
that
we
are
assured
that
a
bohemian
army
would
march
right
into
the
middle
of
a
german
host
so
as
to
separate
division
from
division
and
yet
find
time
to
throw
itself
into
its
normal
formation
just
as
the
critical
moment
arrived
the
only
real
danger
was
from
artillery
fire
which
might
shatter
the
line
of
carts
but
the
hussites
were
themselves
so
well
provided
with
cannon
that
they
could
usually
silence
the
opposing
batteries
never
assuredly
were
the
tactics
of
the
laager
carried
to
such
perfection
were
the
records
of
the
hussite
victories
not
before
us
we
should
have
hesitated
to
believe
that
the
middle
ages
could
have
produced
a
system
whose
success
depended
so
entirely
on
that
power
of
orderly
movement
which
is
usually
claimed
as
the
peculiar
characteristic
of
modern
armies
but
in
the
bohemia
of
the
fifteenth
century
just
as
in
the
england
of
the
seventeenth
fanaticism
led
to
rigid
discipline
not
to
disorder
the
whole
country
we
are
assured
was
divided
into
two
lists
of
parishes
which
alternately
put
their
entire
adult
population
in
the
field
while
the
one
half
fought
the
other
remained
at
home
charged
with
the
cultivation
of
their
own
and
their
neighbours
lands
a
conscription
law
of
the
most
sweeping
kind
which
made
every
man
a
soldier
was
thus
in
force
and
it
becomes
possible
to
understand
the
large
numbers
of
the
armies
put
into
the
field
by
a
state
of
no
great
extent
zisca
s
first
victories
were
to
his
enemies
so
unexpected
and
so
marvellous
that
they
inspired
a
feeling
of
consternation
the
disproportion
of
numbers
and
the
inexperience
of
the
hussites
being
taken
into
consideration
they
were
indeed
surprising
but
instead
of
abandoning
their
stereotyped
feudal
tactics
to
whose
inability
to
cope
with
any
new
form
of
military
efficiency
the
defeats
were
really
due
the
germans
merely
tried
to
raise
larger
armies
and
sent
them
to
incur
the
same
fate
as
the
first
host
which
sigismund
had
led
against
prague
but
the
engagements
only
grew
more
decisive
as
zisca
fully
developed
his
tactical
methods
invasion
after
invasion
was
a
failure
because
when
once
the
bohemians
came
in
sight
the
german
leaders
could
not
induce
their
troops
to
stand
firm
the
men
utterly
declined
to
face
the
flails
and
pikes
of
their
enemies
even
when
the
latter
advanced
far
beyond
their
rampart
of
waggons
and
assumed
the
offensive
the
hussites
were
consequently
so
exalted
with
the
confidence
of
their
own
invincibility
that
they
undertook
and
often
successfully
carried
out
actions
of
the
most
extraordinary
temerity
relying
on
the
terror
which
they
inspired
small
bodies
would
attack
superior
numbers
when
every
military
consideration
was
against
them
and
yet
would
win
the
day
bands
only
a
few
thousand
strong
sallied
forth
from
the
natural
fortress
formed
by
the
bohemian
mountains
and
wasted
bavaria
meissen
thuringia
and
silesia
almost
without
hindrance
they
returned
in
safety
their
laden
with
the
spoil
of
eastern
germany
and
leaving
a
broad
track
of
desolation
behind
them
long
after
zisca
s
death
the
prestige
of
his
tactics
remained
undiminished
and
his
successors
were
able
to
accomplish
feats
of
war
which
would
have
appeared
incredible
in
the
first
years
of
the
war
when
at
last
the
defeat
of
the
taborites
took
place
it
resulted
from
the
dissensions
of
the
bohemians
themselves
not
from
the
increased
efficiency
of
their
enemies
the
battle
of
lipan
where
procopius
fell
and
the
extreme
party
were
crushed
was
a
victory
won
not
by
the
germans
but
by
the
more
moderate
sections
of
the
tzech
nation
the
event
of
the
fight
indicates
at
once
the
weak
spot
of
hussite
tactics
and
the
tremendous
of
the
taborites
after
procopius
had
repelled
the
first
assaults
on
his
circle
of
waggons
his
men
forgetting
that
they
had
to
do
not
with
the
hosts
of
their
old
enemies
but
with
their
own
former
comrades
left
their
defences
and
charged
the
retreating
masses
they
were
accustomed
to
see
the
manœuvre
succeed
against
the
terrorized
germans
and
forgot
that
it
was
only
good
when
turned
against
adversaries
whose
spirit
was
entirely
broken
in
itself
an
advance
meant
the
sacrifice
of
all
the
benefits
of
a
system
of
tactics
which
was
essentially
defensive
the
weakness
in
fact
of
the
device
of
the
was
that
although
securing
the
repulse
of
the
enemy
it
gave
no
opportunity
for
following
up
that
success
if
he
was
wary
and
retreated
in
good
order
this
however
was
not
a
reproach
to
the
inventor
of
the
system
for
zisca
had
originally
to
seek
not
for
the
way
to
win
decisive
victories
but
for
the
way
to
avoid
crushing
defeats
at
lipan
the
moderate
party
had
been
beaten
back
but
not
routed
accordingly
when
the
taborites
came
out
into
the
open
field
the
retreating
masses
turned
to
fight
while
a
cavalry
reserve
which
far
outnumbered
the
horsemen
of
procopius
rode
in
between
the
circle
of
waggons
and
the
troops
which
had
left
it
thus
of
the
taborite
army
were
caught
and
surrounded
in
the
plain
where
they
were
cut
to
pieces
by
the
superior
numbers
of
the
enemy
only
the
few
thousands
who
had
remained
behind
within
the
succeeded
in
escaping
thus
was
demonstrated
the
incompleteness
for
military
purposes
of
a
system
which
had
been
devised
as
a
political
necessity
not
as
an
infallible
recipe
for
victory
the
moral
of
the
fight
of
lipan
was
indeed
the
same
as
the
moral
of
the
fight
of
hastings
purely
defensive
tactics
are
hopeless
when
opposed
by
a
commander
of
ability
and
resource
who
is
provided
with
steady
troops
if
the
german
princes
had
been
generals
and
the
german
troops
the
careers
of
zisca
and
procopius
would
have
been
impossible
bad
strategy
and
panic
combined
to
make
the
hussites
seem
invincible
when
however
they
were
met
by
rational
tactics
they
were
found
to
be
no
less
liable
to
the
logic
of
war
than
other
men
long
before
the
flails
and
of
zisca
s
infantry
had
turned
to
rout
the
chivalry
of
germany
another
body
of
had
won
the
respect
of
eastern
europe
on
the
battlefields
of
the
balkan
peninsula
the
slav
and
the
magyar
had
learned
to
dread
the
of
the
ottoman
sultans
kossova
had
suggested
and
nicopolis
had
proved
that
the
day
of
the
unquestioned
supremacy
of
the
horseman
was
gone
in
the
east
as
much
as
in
the
west
the
janissaries
of
murad
and
bayezid
had
stood
firm
before
desperate
cavalry
charges
and
beaten
them
off
with
loss
it
is
curious
to
recognize
in
the
east
the
tactics
which
had
won
the
battles
of
creçy
and
agincourt
the
janissaries
owed
their
successes
to
precisely
the
same
causes
as
the
english
archer
their
great
weapon
was
the
bow
not
indeed
the
of
the
west
but
nevertheless
a
very
efficient
arm
still
more
notable
is
it
that
they
carried
the
stakes
which
formed
part
of
the
equipment
of
the
english
bowman
and
planted
them
before
their
line
whenever
an
assault
by
cavalry
was
expected
again
and
again
notably
at
nicopolis
and
varna
do
we
hear
of
the
impetuous
charge
which
had
ridden
down
the
rest
of
the
turkish
array
failing
at
last
before
the
palisade
of
the
janissaries
and
the
deadly
fire
of
arrows
from
behind
it
the
rest
of
the
janissary
s
equipment
was
very
simple
he
carried
no
defensive
arms
and
wore
only
a
pointed
felt
cap
and
a
flowing
grey
tunic
reaching
to
the
knees
besides
his
bow
and
quiver
he
bore
a
scimitar
at
his
side
and
a
handjar
or
long
knife
in
his
though
their
disciplined
fanaticism
made
them
formidable
foes
in
close
combat
it
was
not
for
that
kind
of
fighting
that
the
janissaries
were
designed
when
we
find
them
storming
a
breach
or
leading
a
charge
they
were
going
beyond
their
own
province
their
entire
want
of
armour
would
alone
have
sufficed
to
show
that
they
were
not
designed
for
contests
and
it
is
a
noteworthy
fact
that
they
could
never
be
induced
to
take
to
the
use
of
the
pike
like
the
english
archery
they
were
used
either
in
defensive
positions
or
to
supplement
the
employment
of
cavalry
eastern
hosts
ever
since
the
days
of
the
parthians
had
consisted
of
great
masses
of
horsemen
and
their
weakness
had
always
lain
in
the
want
of
some
steadier
force
to
form
the
nucleus
of
resistance
and
the
core
of
the
army
cavalry
can
only
act
on
the
offensive
yet
every
general
is
occasionally
compelled
to
take
the
defensive
the
ottomans
however
were
enabled
to
solve
the
problem
of
producing
an
army
efficient
for
both
alike
when
once
orchan
had
armed
and
trained
the
janissaries
the
timariot
horsemen
who
formed
the
bulk
of
the
turkish
army
differed
little
from
the
cavalry
of
other
oriental
states
not
unfrequently
they
suffered
defeats
shah
ismail
s
persian
cavaliers
rode
them
down
at
tchaldiran
and
the
mamelukes
broke
them
at
radama
if
it
had
been
with
his
feudal
horse
alone
that
the
turkish
sultan
had
faced
the
chivalry
of
the
west
there
is
little
reason
to
suppose
that
the
conquest
of
the
balkan
peninsula
would
ever
have
been
effected
attacked
in
its
own
home
the
hungarian
perhaps
even
the
servian
state
could
in
the
fourteenth
century
put
into
the
field
armies
equal
in
numbers
and
individually
superior
to
the
ottoman
horsemen
but
the
servian
and
the
hungarian
like
the
persian
and
the
mameluke
did
not
possess
any
solid
and
trustworthy
body
of
infantry
to
face
the
disciplined
array
of
the
janissaries
they
had
only
the
chaotic
and
hordes
of
the
national
levy
to
this
we
must
ascribe
the
splendid
successes
of
the
sultans
however
the
tide
of
battle
might
fluctuate
the
janissaries
would
stand
like
a
rock
behind
their
stakes
and
it
was
almost
unknown
that
they
should
be
broken
again
and
again
they
saved
the
fortune
of
the
day
at
those
few
fights
where
they
could
not
they
at
least
died
in
their
ranks
and
saved
the
honour
of
their
corps
at
the
disaster
of
angora
they
continued
to
struggle
long
after
the
rest
of
the
turkish
army
had
dispersed
and
were
at
last
exterminated
rather
than
beaten
no
steadier
troops
could
have
been
found
in
any
part
of
europe
perhaps
the
most
interesting
of
ottoman
fights
from
the
tactician
s
point
of
view
was
the
second
battle
of
kossova
this
was
not
like
varna
or
mohacs
an
attempt
to
break
the
turkish
line
by
a
headlong
onset
john
huniades
whom
long
experience
had
made
familiar
with
the
tactics
of
his
enemy
endeavoured
to
turn
against
sultan
murad
his
own
usual
scheme
to
face
the
janissaries
he
drew
up
in
his
centre
a
strong
force
of
german
infantry
armed
with
the
whose
use
the
hussites
had
introduced
on
the
wings
the
chivalry
of
hungary
were
destined
to
cope
with
the
masses
of
the
timariot
cavalry
in
consequence
of
this
arrangement
the
two
centres
faced
each
other
for
long
hours
neither
advancing
but
each
occupied
in
thinning
the
enemy
s
ranks
the
one
with
the
the
other
with
the
bullet
meanwhile
on
the
wings
desperate
cavalry
charges
succeeded
each
other
till
on
the
second
day
the
wallachian
allies
of
huniades
gave
way
before
the
superior
numbers
of
the
ottomans
and
the
christian
centre
had
to
draw
off
and
retire
so
desperate
had
the
fighting
been
that
half
the
hungarian
army
and
a
third
of
that
of
murad
was
left
upon
the
field
the
tactical
meaning
of
the
engagement
was
plain
good
infantry
could
make
a
long
resistance
to
the
ottoman
arms
even
if
they
could
not
secure
the
victory
the
lesson
however
was
not
fully
realized
and
it
was
not
till
the
military
revolution
of
the
sixteenth
century
that
infantry
was
destined
to
take
the
prominent
part
in
withstanding
the
ottoman
the
landsknechts
and
of
charles
v
and
ferdinand
of
austria
proved
much
more
formidable
foes
to
the
sultans
than
the
gallant
but
undisciplined
light
cavalry
of
hungary
this
was
to
a
great
extent
due
to
the
perfection
of
in
the
west
the
turks
whose
infantry
could
never
be
induced
to
adopt
that
weapon
relied
entirely
on
their
firearms
and
were
checked
by
the
combination
of
pike
and
hackbut
it
is
noticeable
that
the
janissaries
took
to
the
use
of
the
firelock
at
a
comparatively
early
date
it
may
have
been
in
consequence
of
the
effectiveness
of
huniades
at
kossova
that
we
find
them
discarding
the
arbalest
in
favour
of
the
newer
weapon
but
at
any
rate
the
ottoman
had
fully
accomplished
the
change
long
before
it
had
been
finally
carried
out
in
europe
and
nearly
a
century
earlier
than
the
nations
of
the
further
east
in
recognizing
the
full
importance
of
cannon
the
sultans
were
equally
in
advance
of
their
times
the
capture
of
constantinople
by
mahomet
ii
was
probably
the
first
event
of
supreme
importance
whose
result
was
determined
by
the
power
of
artillery
the
lighter
guns
of
previous
years
had
never
accomplished
any
feat
comparable
in
its
results
to
that
which
was
achieved
by
the
of
the
conqueror
some
decades
later
we
find
the
janissaries
line
of
arquebuses
supported
by
the
fire
of
often
brought
forward
in
great
numbers
and
chained
together
so
as
to
prevent
cavalry
charging
down
the
intervals
between
the
guns
this
device
is
said
to
have
been
employed
with
great
success
against
an
enemy
superior
in
the
numbers
of
his
horsemen
alike
at
dolbek
and
tchaldiran
the
ascendency
of
the
turkish
arms
was
finally
terminated
by
the
conjunction
of
several
causes
of
these
the
chief
was
the
rise
in
central
europe
of
standing
armies
composed
for
the
most
part
of
disciplined
infantry
but
it
is
no
less
undoubted
that
much
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
ottomans
after
the
reign
of
soliman
fell
behind
their
contemporaries
in
readiness
to
keep
up
with
the
advance
of
military
skill
a
change
which
may
be
connected
with
the
gradual
transformation
of
the
janissaries
from
a
corps
into
a
caste
it
should
also
be
remembered
that
the
frontier
of
christendom
was
now
covered
not
by
one
isolated
fortress
of
supreme
importance
such
as
belgrade
had
been
but
by
a
double
and
triple
line
of
strong
towns
whose
existence
made
it
hard
for
the
turks
to
advance
with
rapidity
or
to
reap
any
such
results
from
success
in
a
single
battle
or
siege
as
had
been
possible
in
the
previous
century
on
the
warfare
of
the
other
nations
of
eastern
europe
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
dwell
the
military
history
of
russia
though
interesting
in
itself
exercised
no
influence
on
the
general
progress
of
the
art
of
war
with
the
more
important
development
of
new
tactical
methods
in
europe
we
have
already
dealt
when
describing
the
spanish
infantry
in
the
chapter
devoted
to
the
swiss
and
their
enemies
all
the
systems
of
real
weight
and
consideration
have
now
been
discussed
in
the
overthrow
of
the
supremacy
of
feudal
cavalry
the
tactics
of
the
shock
and
the
tactics
of
the
missile
had
each
played
their
part
which
had
been
the
more
effective
it
would
be
hard
to
say
between
them
however
the
task
had
been
successfully
accomplished
the
military
strength
of
that
system
which
had
embraced
all
europe
in
its
cramping
fetters
had
been
shattered
to
atoms
warlike
efficiency
was
the
attribute
no
longer
of
a
class
but
of
whole
nations
and
war
had
ceased
to
be
an
occupation
in
which
feudal
chivalry
found
its
pleasure
and
the
rest
of
society
its
ruin
the
art
of
war
had
become
once
more
a
living
reality
a
matter
not
of
tradition
but
of
experiment
and
the
vigorous
sixteenth
century
was
rapidly
adding
to
it
new
forms
and
variations
the
middle
ages
were
at
last
over
and
the
stirring
and
scientific
spirit
of
the
modern
world
was
working
a
transformation
in
military
matters
which
was
to
make
the
methods
of
mediæval
war
seem
even
further
removed
from
the
strategy
of
our

thereupon
ordered
