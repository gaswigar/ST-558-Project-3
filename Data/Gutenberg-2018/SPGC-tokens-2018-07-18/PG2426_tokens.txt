transcribed
from
the
macmillan
and
edition
by

the
diary
of
a
man
of
fifty
by
henry
james
florence
they
told
me
i
should
find
italy
greatly
changed
and
in
years
there
is
room
for
changes
but
to
me
everything
is
so
perfectly
the
same
that
i
seem
to
be
living
my
youth
over
again
all
the
forgotten
impressions
of
that
enchanting
time
come
back
to
me
at
the
moment
they
were
powerful
enough
but
they
afterwards
faded
away
what
in
the
world
became
of
them
whatever
becomes
of
such
things
in
the
long
intervals
of
consciousness
where
do
they
hide
themselves
away
in
what
unvisited
cupboards
and
crannies
of
our
being
do
they
preserve
themselves
they
are
like
the
lines
of
a
letter
written
in
sympathetic
ink
hold
the
letter
to
the
fire
for
a
while
and
the
grateful
warmth
brings
out
the
invisible
words
it
is
the
warmth
of
this
yellow
sun
of
florence
that
has
been
restoring
the
text
of
my
own
young
romance
the
thing
has
been
lying
before
me
today
as
a
clear
fresh
page
there
have
been
moments
during
the
last
ten
years
when
i
have
fell
so
portentously
old
so
fagged
and
finished
that
i
should
have
taken
as
a
very
bad
joke
any
intimation
that
this
present
sense
of
juvenility
was
still
in
store
for
me
it
wo
last
at
any
rate
so
i
had
better
make
the
best
of
it
but
i
confess
it
surprises
me
i
have
led
too
serious
a
life
but
that
perhaps
after
all
preserves
one
youth
at
all
events
i
have
travelled
too
far
i
have
worked
too
hard
i
have
lived
in
brutal
climates
and
associated
with
tiresome
people
when
a
man
has
reached
his
year
without
being
materially
the
worse
for
wear
when
he
has
fair
health
a
fair
fortune
a
tidy
conscience
and
a
complete
exemption
from
embarrassing
relatives
i
suppose
he
is
bound
in
delicacy
to
write
himself
happy
but
i
confess
i
shirk
this
obligation
i
have
not
been
miserable
i
wo
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
or
at
least
as
to
write
it
but
happiness
positive
happiness
would
have
been
something
different
i
do
know
that
it
would
have
been
better
by
all
measurements
that
it
would
have
left
me
better
off
at
the
present
time
but
it
certainly
would
have
made
this
difference
that
i
should
not
have
been
reduced
in
pursuit
of
pleasant
images
to
disinter
a
buried
episode
of
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
i
should
have
found
entertainment
more
what
shall
i
call
it
more
contemporaneous
i
should
have
had
a
wife
and
children
and
i
should
not
be
in
the
way
of
making
as
the
french
say
infidelities
to
the
present
of
course
it
a
great
gain
to
have
had
an
escape
not
to
have
committed
an
act
of
thumping
folly
and
i
suppose
that
whatever
serious
step
one
might
have
taken
at
after
a
struggle
and
with
a
violent
effort
and
however
one
conduct
might
appear
to
be
justified
by
events
there
would
always
remain
a
certain
element
of
regret
a
certain
sense
of
loss
lurking
in
the
sense
of
gain
a
tendency
to
wonder
rather
wishfully
what
have
been
what
might
have
been
in
this
case
would
without
doubt
have
been
very
sad
and
what
has
been
has
been
very
cheerful
and
comfortable
but
there
are
nevertheless
two
or
three
questions
i
might
ask
myself
why
for
instance
have
i
never
married
why
have
i
never
been
able
to
care
for
any
woman
as
i
cared
for
that
one
ah
why
are
the
mountains
blue
and
why
is
the
sunshine
warm
happiness
mitigated
by
impertinent
conjectures
that
about
my
ticket
i
knew
it
would
last
it
already
passing
away
but
i
have
spent
a
delightful
day
i
have
been
strolling
all
over
the
place
everything
reminds
me
of
something
else
and
yet
of
itself
at
the
same
time
my
imagination
makes
a
great
circuit
and
comes
back
to
the
point
there
is
that
odour
of
spring
in
the
air
and
the
flowers
as
they
used
to
be
are
gathered
into
great
sheaves
and
stacks
all
along
the
rugged
base
of
the
strozzi
palace
i
wandered
for
an
hour
in
the
boboli
gardens
we
went
there
several
times
together
i
remember
all
those
days
individually
they
seem
to
me
as
yesterday
i
found
the
corner
where
she
always
chose
to
sit
the
bench
of
marble
in
front
of
the
screen
of
ilex
with
that
exuberant
statue
of
pomona
just
beside
it
the
place
is
exactly
the
same
except
that
poor
pomona
has
lost
one
of
her
tapering
fingers
i
sat
there
for
half
an
hour
and
it
was
strange
how
near
to
me
she
seemed
the
place
was
perfectly
empty
that
is
it
was
filled
with
i
closed
my
eyes
and
listened
i
could
almost
hear
the
rustle
of
her
dress
on
the
gravel
why
do
we
make
such
an
ado
about
death
what
is
it
after
all
but
a
sort
of
refinement
of
life
she
died
ten
years
ago
and
yet
as
i
sat
there
in
the
sunny
stillness
she
was
a
palpable
audible
presence
i
went
afterwards
into
the
gallery
of
the
palace
and
wandered
for
an
hour
from
room
to
room
the
same
great
pictures
hung
in
the
same
places
and
the
same
dark
frescoes
arched
above
them
twice
of
old
i
went
there
with
her
she
had
a
great
understanding
of
art
she
understood
all
sorts
of
things
before
the
madonna
of
the
chair
i
stood
a
long
time
the
face
is
not
a
particle
like
hers
and
yet
it
reminded
me
of
her
but
everything
does
that
we
stood
and
looked
at
it
together
once
for
half
an
hour
i
remember
perfectly
what
she
said
yesterday
i
felt
blue
blue
and
bored
and
when
i
got
up
this
morning
i
had
half
a
mind
to
leave
florence
but
i
went
out
into
the
street
beside
the
arno
and
looked
up
and
down
looked
at
the
yellow
river
and
the
violet
hills
and
then
decided
to
remain
or
rather
i
decided
nothing
i
simply
stood
gazing
at
the
beauty
of
florence
and
before
i
had
gazed
my
fill
i
was
in
again
and
it
was
too
late
to
start
for
rome
i
strolled
along
the
quay
where
something
presently
happened
that
rewarded
me
for
staying
i
stopped
in
front
of
a
little
jeweller
shop
where
a
great
many
objects
in
mosaic
were
exposed
in
the
window
i
stood
there
for
some
minutes
i
do
know
why
for
i
have
no
taste
for
mosaic
in
a
moment
a
little
girl
came
and
stood
beside
me
a
little
girl
with
a
frowsy
italian
head
carrying
a
basket
i
turned
away
but
as
i
turned
my
eyes
happened
to
fall
on
her
basket
it
was
covered
with
a
napkin
and
on
the
napkin
was
pinned
a
piece
of
paper
inscribed
with
an
address
this
address
caught
my
glance
there
was
a
name
on
it
i
knew
it
was
very
legibly
written
evidently
by
a
scribe
who
had
made
up
in
zeal
what
was
lacking
in
skill
via
so
ran
the
superscription
i
looked
at
it
for
some
moments
it
caused
me
a
sudden
emotion
presently
the
little
girl
becoming
aware
of
my
attention
glanced
up
at
me
wondering
with
a
pair
of
timid
brown
eyes
are
you
carrying
your
basket
to
the
countess
salvi
i
asked
the
child
stared
at
me
to
the
countess
scarabelli
do
you
know
the
countess
know
her
murmured
the
child
with
an
air
of
small
dismay
i
mean
have
you
seen
her
yes
i
have
seen
her
and
then
in
a
moment
with
a
sudden
soft
smile
said
the
little
girl
she
was
beautiful
herself
as
she
said
it
precisely
and
is
she
fair
or
dark
the
child
kept
gazing
at
me
she
answered
looking
about
into
the
golden
sunshine
for
a
comparison
and
is
she
young
she
is
not
young
like
me
but
she
is
not
old
like
like
like
me
eh
and
is
she
married
the
little
girl
began
to
look
wise
i
have
never
seen
the
signor
conte
and
she
lives
in
via
ghibellina
in
a
beautiful
palace
i
had
one
more
question
to
ask
and
i
pointed
it
with
certain
copper
coins
tell
me
a
little
is
she
good
the
child
inspected
a
moment
the
contents
of
her
little
brown
fist
you
who
are
good
she
answered
ah
but
the
countess
i
repeated
my
informant
lowered
her
big
brown
eyes
with
an
air
of
conscientious
meditation
that
was
inexpressibly
quaint
to
me
she
appears
so
she
said
at
last
looking
up
ah
then
she
must
be
so
i
said
because
for
your
age
you
are
very
intelligent
and
having
delivered
myself
of
this
compliment
i
walked
away
and
left
the
little
girl
counting
her
i
walked
back
to
the
hotel
wondering
how
i
could
learn
something
about
the
contessa
in
the
doorway
i
found
the
innkeeper
and
near
him
stood
a
young
man
whom
i
immediately
perceived
to
be
a
compatriot
and
with
whom
apparently
he
had
been
in
conversation
i
wonder
whether
you
can
give
me
a
piece
of
information
i
said
to
the
landlord
do
you
know
anything
about
the
count
the
landlord
looked
down
at
his
boots
then
slowly
raised
his
shoulders
with
a
melancholy
smile
i
have
many
regrets
dear
sir
you
do
know
the
name
i
know
the
name
assuredly
but
i
do
know
the
gentleman
i
saw
that
my
question
had
attracted
the
attention
of
the
young
englishman
who
looked
at
me
with
a
good
deal
of
earnestness
he
was
apparently
satisfied
with
what
he
saw
for
he
presently
decided
to
speak
the
count
scarabelli
is
dead
he
said
very
gravely
i
looked
at
him
a
moment
he
was
a
pleasing
young
fellow
and
his
widow
lives
i
observed
in
via
ghibellina
i
daresay
that
is
the
name
of
the
street
he
was
a
handsome
young
englishman
but
he
was
also
an
awkward
one
he
wondered
who
i
was
and
what
i
wanted
and
he
did
me
the
honour
to
perceive
that
as
regards
these
points
my
appearance
was
reassuring
but
he
hesitated
very
properly
to
talk
with
a
perfect
stranger
about
a
lady
whom
he
knew
and
he
had
not
the
art
to
conceal
his
hesitation
i
instantly
felt
it
to
be
singular
that
though
he
regarded
me
as
a
perfect
stranger
i
had
not
the
same
feeling
about
him
whether
it
was
that
i
had
seen
him
before
or
simply
that
i
was
struck
with
his
agreeable
young
face
at
any
rate
i
felt
myself
as
they
say
here
in
sympathy
with
him
if
i
have
seen
him
before
i
do
remember
the
occasion
and
neither
apparently
does
he
i
suppose
it
only
a
part
of
the
feeling
i
have
had
the
last
three
days
about
everything
it
was
this
feeling
that
made
me
suddenly
act
as
if
i
had
known
him
a
long
time
do
you
know
the
countess
salvi
i
asked
he
looked
at
me
a
little
and
then
without
resenting
the
freedom
of
my
question
the
countess
scarabelli
you
mean
he
said
yes
i
answered
she
the
daughter
the
daughter
is
a
little
girl
she
must
be
grown
up
now
she
must
be
let
me
see
close
upon
thirty
my
young
englishman
began
to
smile
of
whom
are
you
speaking
i
was
speaking
of
the
daughter
i
said
understanding
his
smile
but
i
was
thinking
of
the
mother
of
the
mother
of
a
person
i
knew
years
ago
the
most
charming
woman
i
have
ever
known
she
was
the
countess
salvi
she
lived
in
a
wonderful
old
house
in
via
ghibellina
a
wonderful
old
house
my
young
englishman
repeated
she
had
a
little
girl
i
went
on
and
the
little
girl
was
very
fair
like
her
mother
and
the
mother
and
daughter
had
the
same
name
bianca
i
stopped
and
looked
at
my
companion
and
he
blushed
a
little
and
bianca
salvi
i
continued
was
the
most
charming
woman
in
the
world
he
blushed
a
little
more
and
i
laid
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
do
you
know
why
i
tell
you
this
because
you
remind
me
of
what
i
was
when
i
knew
her
when
i
loved
her
my
poor
young
englishman
gazed
at
me
with
a
sort
of
embarrassed
and
fascinated
stare
and
still
i
went
on
i
say
that
the
reason
i
told
you
this
but
you
think
it
a
strange
reason
you
remind
me
of
my
younger
self
you
need
resent
that
i
was
a
charming
young
fellow
the
countess
salvi
thought
so
her
daughter
thinks
the
same
of
you
instantly
instinctively
he
raised
his
hand
to
my
arm
truly
ah
you
are
wonderfully
like
me
i
said
laughing
that
was
just
my
state
of
mind
i
wanted
tremendously
to
please
her
he
dropped
his
hand
and
looked
away
smiling
but
with
an
air
of
ingenuous
confusion
which
quickened
my
interest
in
him
you
do
know
what
to
make
of
me
i
pursued
you
do
know
why
a
stranger
should
suddenly
address
you
in
this
way
and
pretend
to
read
your
thoughts
doubtless
you
think
me
a
little
cracked
perhaps
i
am
eccentric
but
it
not
so
bad
as
that
i
have
lived
about
the
world
a
great
deal
following
my
profession
which
is
that
of
a
soldier
i
have
been
in
india
in
africa
in
canada
and
i
have
lived
a
good
deal
alone
that
inclines
people
i
think
to
sudden
bursts
of
confidence
a
week
ago
i
came
into
italy
where
i
spent
six
months
when
i
was
your
age
i
came
straight
to
florence
i
was
eager
to
see
it
again
on
account
of
associations
they
have
been
crowding
upon
me
ever
so
thickly
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
giving
you
a
hint
of
them
the
young
man
inclined
himself
a
little
in
silence
as
if
he
had
been
struck
with
a
sudden
respect
he
stood
and
looked
away
for
a
moment
at
the
river
and
the
mountains
it
very
beautiful
i
said
oh
it
enchanting
he
murmured
that
the
way
i
used
to
talk
but
that
nothing
to
you
he
glanced
at
me
again
on
the
contrary
i
like
to
hear
well
then
let
us
take
a
walk
if
you
too
are
staying
at
this
inn
we
are
we
will
walk
down
the
arno
to
the
cascine
there
are
several
things
i
should
like
to
ask
of
you
my
young
englishman
assented
with
an
air
of
almost
filial
confidence
and
we
strolled
for
an
hour
beside
the
river
and
through
the
shady
alleys
of
that
lovely
wilderness
we
had
a
great
deal
of
talk
it
not
only
myself
it
my
whole
situation
over
again
are
you
very
fond
of
italy
i
asked
he
hesitated
a
moment
one
ca
express
that
just
so
i
could
express
it
i
used
to
try
i
used
to
write
verses
on
the
subject
of
italy
i
was
very
ridiculous
so
am
i
ridiculous
said
my
companion
no
my
dear
boy
i
answered
we
are
not
ridiculous
we
are
two
very
reasonable
superior
people
the
first
time
one
comes
as
i
have
done
it
a
revelation
oh
i
remember
well
one
never
forgets
it
it
an
introduction
to
beauty
and
it
must
be
a
great
pleasure
said
my
young
friend
to
come
back
yes
fortunately
the
beauty
is
always
here
what
form
of
it
i
asked
do
you
prefer
my
companion
looked
a
little
mystified
and
at
last
he
said
i
am
very
fond
of
the
pictures
so
was
i
and
among
the
pictures
which
do
you
like
best
oh
a
great
many
so
did
i
but
i
had
certain
favourites
again
the
young
man
hesitated
a
little
and
then
he
confessed
that
the
group
of
painters
he
preferred
on
the
whole
to
all
others
was
that
of
the
early
florentines
i
was
so
struck
with
this
that
i
stopped
short
that
was
exactly
my
taste
and
then
i
passed
my
hand
into
his
arm
and
we
went
our
way
again
we
sat
down
on
an
old
stone
bench
in
the
cascine
and
a
solemn
hermes
with
wrinkles
accentuated
by
the
dust
of
ages
stood
above
us
and
listened
to
our
talk
the
countess
salvi
died
ten
years
ago
i
said
my
companion
admitted
that
he
had
heard
her
daughter
say
so
after
i
knew
her
she
married
again
i
added
the
count
salvi
died
before
i
knew
her
a
couple
of
years
after
their
marriage
yes
i
have
heard
that
and
what
else
have
you
heard
my
companion
stared
at
me
he
had
evidently
heard
nothing
she
was
a
very
interesting
woman
there
are
a
great
many
things
to
be
said
about
her
later
perhaps
i
will
tell
you
has
the
daughter
the
same
charm
you
forget
said
my
young
man
smiling
that
i
have
never
seen
the
mother
very
true
i
keep
confounding
but
the
daughter
how
long
have
you
known
her
only
since
i
have
been
here
a
very
short
time
a
week
for
a
moment
he
said
nothing
a
month
that
just
the
answer
i
should
have
made
a
week
a
month
it
was
all
the
same
to
me
i
think
it
is
more
than
a
month
said
the
young
man
it
probably
six
how
did
you
make
her
acquaintance
by
a
letter
an
introduction
given
me
by
a
friend
in
england
the
analogy
is
complete
i
said
but
the
friend
who
gave
me
my
letter
to
madame
de
salvi
died
many
years
ago
he
too
admired
her
greatly
i
do
know
why
it
never
came
into
my
mind
that
her
daughter
might
be
living
in
florence
somehow
i
took
for
granted
it
was
all
over
i
never
thought
of
the
little
girl
i
never
heard
what
had
become
of
her
i
walked
past
the
palace
yesterday
and
saw
that
it
was
occupied
but
i
took
for
granted
it
had
changed
hands
the
countess
scarabelli
said
my
friend
brought
it
to
her
husband
as
her
i
hope
he
appreciated
it
there
is
a
fountain
in
the
court
and
there
is
a
charming
old
garden
beyond
it
the
countess
looks
into
that
garden
the
staircase
is
of
white
marble
and
there
is
a
medallion
by
luca
della
robbia
set
into
the
wall
at
the
place
where
it
makes
a
bend
before
you
come
into
the
you
stand
a
moment
in
a
great
vaulted
place
hung
round
with
faded
tapestry
paved
with
bare
tiles
and
furnished
only
with
three
chairs
in
the
above
the
fireplace
is
a
superb
andrea
del
sarto
the
furniture
is
covered
with
pale
my
companion
listened
to
all
this
the
andrea
del
sarto
is
there
it
magnificent
but
the
furniture
is
in
pale
red
ah
they
have
changed
it
then
in
years
and
there
a
portrait
of
madame
de
salvi
continued
my
friend
i
was
silent
a
moment
i
should
like
to
see
that
he
too
was
silent
then
he
asked
why
do
you
go
and
see
it
if
you
knew
the
mother
so
well
why
do
you
call
upon
the
daughter
from
what
you
tell
me
i
am
afraid
what
have
i
told
you
to
make
you
afraid
i
looked
a
little
at
his
ingenuous
countenance
the
mother
was
a
very
dangerous
woman
the
young
englishman
began
to
blush
again
the
daughter
is
not
he
said
are
you
very
sure
he
did
say
he
was
sure
but
he
presently
inquired
in
what
way
the
countess
salvi
had
been
dangerous
you
must
not
ask
me
that
i
answered
for
after
all
i
desire
to
remember
only
what
was
good
in
her
and
as
we
walked
back
i
begged
him
to
render
me
the
service
of
mentioning
my
name
to
his
friend
and
of
saying
that
i
had
known
her
mother
well
and
that
i
asked
permission
to
come
and
see
her
i
have
seen
that
poor
boy
half
a
dozen
times
again
and
a
most
amiable
young
fellow
he
is
he
continues
to
represent
to
me
in
the
most
extraordinary
manner
my
own
young
identity
the
correspondence
is
perfect
at
all
points
save
that
he
is
a
better
boy
than
i
he
is
evidently
acutely
interested
in
his
countess
and
leads
quite
the
same
life
with
her
that
i
led
with
madame
de
salvi
he
goes
to
see
her
every
evening
and
stays
half
the
night
these
florentines
keep
the
most
extraordinary
hours
i
remember
towards
madame
de
salvi
used
to
turn
me
come
come
she
would
say
it
time
to
go
if
you
were
to
stay
later
people
might
talk
i
do
know
at
what
time
he
comes
home
but
i
suppose
his
evening
seems
as
short
as
mine
did
today
he
brought
me
a
message
from
his
contessa
a
very
gracious
little
speech
she
remembered
often
to
have
heard
her
mother
speak
of
me
she
called
me
her
english
friend
all
her
mother
friends
were
dear
to
her
and
she
begged
i
would
do
her
the
honour
to
come
and
see
her
she
is
always
at
home
of
an
evening
poor
young
stanmer
he
is
of
the
devonshire
stanmers
a
great
property
reported
this
speech
verbatim
and
of
course
it
ca
in
the
least
signify
to
him
that
a
poor
grizzled
battered
soldier
old
enough
to
be
his
father
should
come
to
call
upon
his
but
i
remember
how
it
used
to
matter
to
me
when
other
men
came
that
a
point
of
difference
however
it
only
because
i
so
old
at
i
should
have
been
afraid
of
myself
at
camerino
was
and
then
the
others
she
was
always
at
home
in
the
evening
and
they
all
used
to
come
they
were
old
florentine
names
but
she
used
to
let
me
stay
after
them
all
she
thought
an
old
english
name
as
good
what
a
transcendent
coquette
but
as
she
used
to
say
i
meant
to
go
tonight
to
casa
salvi
but
i
bring
myself
to
the
point
i
do
know
what
i
afraid
of
i
used
to
be
in
a
hurry
enough
to
go
there
once
i
suppose
i
am
afraid
of
the
very
look
of
the
place
of
the
old
rooms
the
old
walls
i
shall
go
tomorrow
night
i
am
afraid
of
the
very
echoes
she
has
the
most
extraordinary
resemblance
to
her
mother
when
i
went
in
i
was
tremendously
startled
i
stood
starting
at
her
i
have
just
come
home
it
is
past
midnight
i
have
been
all
the
evening
at
casa
salvi
it
is
very
warm
my
window
is
open
i
can
look
out
on
the
river
gliding
past
in
the
starlight
so
of
old
when
i
came
home
i
used
to
stand
and
look
out
there
are
the
same
cypresses
on
the
opposite
hills
poor
young
stanmer
was
there
and
three
or
four
other
admirers
they
all
got
up
when
i
came
in
i
think
i
had
been
talked
about
and
there
was
some
curiosity
but
why
should
i
have
been
talked
about
they
were
all
youngish
men
none
of
them
of
my
time
she
is
a
wonderful
likeness
of
her
mother
i
could
get
over
it
beautiful
like
her
mother
and
yet
with
the
same
faults
in
her
face
but
with
her
mother
perfect
head
and
brow
and
sympathetic
almost
pitying
eyes
her
face
has
just
that
peculiarity
of
her
mother
which
of
all
human
countenances
that
i
have
ever
known
was
the
one
that
passed
most
quickly
and
completely
from
the
expression
of
gaiety
to
that
of
repose
repose
in
her
face
always
suggested
sadness
and
while
you
were
watching
it
with
a
kind
of
awe
and
wondering
of
what
tragic
secret
it
was
the
token
it
kindled
on
the
instant
into
a
radiant
italian
smile
the
countess
scarabelli
smiles
tonight
however
were
almost
uninterrupted
she
greeted
me
divinely
as
her
mother
used
to
do
and
young
stanmer
sat
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
as
i
used
to
do
and
watched
her
while
she
talked
she
is
thin
and
very
fair
and
was
dressed
in
light
vaporous
black
that
completes
the
resemblance
the
house
the
rooms
are
almost
absolutely
the
same
there
may
be
changes
of
detail
but
they
do
modify
the
general
effect
there
are
the
same
precious
pictures
on
the
walls
of
the
salon
the
same
great
dusky
fresco
in
the
concave
ceiling
the
daughter
is
not
rich
i
suppose
any
more
than
the
mother
the
furniture
is
worn
and
faded
and
i
was
admitted
by
a
solitary
servant
who
carried
a
twinkling
taper
before
me
up
the
great
dark
marble
staircase
i
have
often
heard
of
you
said
the
countess
as
i
sat
down
near
her
my
mother
often
spoke
of
you
often
i
answered
i
am
surprised
at
that
why
are
you
surprised
were
you
not
good
friends
yes
for
a
certain
time
very
good
friends
but
i
was
sure
she
had
forgotten
me
she
never
forgot
said
the
countess
looking
at
me
intently
and
smiling
she
was
not
like
that
she
was
not
like
most
other
women
in
any
way
i
declared
ah
she
was
charming
cried
the
countess
rattling
open
her
fan
i
have
always
been
very
curious
to
see
you
i
have
received
an
impression
of
you
a
good
one
i
hope
she
looked
at
me
laughing
and
not
answering
this
it
was
just
her
mother
trick
englishman
she
used
to
call
you
mio
i
hope
she
spoke
of
me
kindly
i
insisted
the
countess
still
laughing
gave
a
little
shrug
balancing
her
hand
to
and
fro
i
always
supposed
you
had
had
a
quarrel
you
mind
my
being
frank
like
this
eh
i
delight
in
it
it
reminds
me
of
your
mother
every
one
tells
me
that
but
i
am
not
clever
like
her
you
will
see
for
yourself
that
speech
i
said
completes
the
resemblance
she
was
always
pretending
she
was
not
clever
and
in
reality
in
reality
she
was
an
angel
eh
to
escape
from
dangerous
comparisons
i
will
admit
then
that
i
am
clever
that
will
make
a
difference
but
let
us
talk
of
you
you
are
very
how
shall
i
say
it
very
eccentric
is
that
what
your
mother
told
you
to
tell
the
truth
she
spoke
of
you
as
a
great
original
but
are
all
englishmen
eccentric
all
except
that
one
and
the
countess
pointed
to
poor
stanmer
in
his
corner
of
the
sofa
oh
i
know
just
what
he
is
i
said
he
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
he
like
all
the
world
cried
the
countess
like
all
the
world
yes
he
is
in
love
with
you
she
looked
at
me
with
sudden
gravity
i
do
object
to
your
saying
that
for
all
the
world
but
i
do
for
him
well
i
went
on
he
is
peculiar
in
this
he
is
rather
afraid
of
you
instantly
she
began
to
smile
she
turned
her
face
toward
stanmer
he
had
seen
that
we
were
talking
about
him
he
coloured
and
got
up
then
came
toward
us
i
like
men
who
are
afraid
of
nothing
said
our
hostess
i
know
what
you
want
i
said
to
stanmer
you
want
to
know
what
the
signora
contessa
says
about
you
stanmer
looked
straight
into
her
face
very
gravely
i
do
care
a
straw
what
she
says
you
are
almost
a
match
for
the
signora
contessa
i
answered
she
declares
she
does
care
a
pin
head
what
you
think
i
recognise
the
countess
style
stanmer
exclaimed
turning
away
one
would
think
said
the
countess
that
you
were
trying
to
make
a
quarrel
between
us
i
watched
him
move
away
to
another
part
of
the
great
saloon
he
stood
in
front
of
the
andrea
del
sarto
looking
up
at
it
but
he
was
not
seeing
it
he
was
listening
to
what
we
might
say
i
often
stood
there
in
just
that
way
he
ca
quarrel
with
you
any
more
than
i
could
have
quarrelled
with
your
mother
ah
but
you
did
something
painful
passed
between
you
yes
it
was
painful
but
it
was
not
a
quarrel
i
went
away
one
day
and
never
saw
her
again
that
was
all
the
countess
looked
at
me
gravely
what
do
you
call
it
when
a
man
does
that
it
depends
upon
the
case
sometimes
said
the
countess
in
french
it
a
yes
and
sometimes
it
an
act
of
wisdom
and
sometimes
rejoined
the
countess
it
a
mistake
i
shook
my
head
for
me
it
was
no
mistake
she
began
to
laugh
again
caro
signore
you
a
great
original
what
had
my
poor
mother
done
to
you
i
looked
at
our
young
englishman
who
still
had
his
back
turned
to
us
and
was
staring
up
at
the
picture
i
will
tell
you
some
other
time
i
said
i
shall
certainly
remind
you
i
am
very
curious
to
know
then
she
opened
and
shut
her
fan
two
or
three
times
still
looking
at
me
what
eyes
they
have
tell
me
a
little
she
went
on
if
i
may
ask
without
indiscretion
are
you
married
no
signora
contessa
is
that
at
least
a
mistake
do
i
look
very
unhappy
she
dropped
her
head
a
little
to
one
side
for
an
englishman
no
ah
said
i
laughing
you
are
quite
as
clever
as
your
mother
and
they
tell
me
that
you
are
a
great
soldier
she
continued
you
have
lived
in
india
it
was
very
kind
of
you
so
far
away
to
have
remembered
our
poor
dear
italy
one
always
remembers
italy
the
distance
makes
no
difference
i
remembered
it
well
the
day
i
heard
of
your
mother
death
ah
that
was
a
sorrow
said
the
countess
there
not
a
day
that
i
do
weep
for
her
but
she
a
saint
its
paradise
i
answered
and
i
looked
some
time
at
the
ground
but
tell
me
about
yourself
dear
lady
i
asked
at
last
raising
my
eyes
you
have
also
had
the
sorrow
of
losing
your
husband
i
am
a
poor
widow
as
you
see
my
husband
died
after
three
years
of
marriage
i
waited
for
her
to
remark
that
the
late
count
scarabelli
was
also
a
saint
in
paradise
but
i
waited
in
vain
that
was
like
your
distinguished
father
i
said
yes
he
too
died
young
i
ca
be
said
to
have
known
him
i
was
but
of
the
age
of
my
own
little
girl
but
i
weep
for
him
all
the
more
again
i
was
silent
for
a
moment
it
was
in
india
too
i
said
presently
that
i
heard
of
your
second
marriage
the
countess
raised
her
eyebrows
in
india
then
one
hears
of
everything
did
that
news
please
you
well
since
you
ask
me
no
i
understand
that
said
the
countess
looking
at
her
open
fan
i
shall
not
marry
again
like
that
that
what
your
mother
said
to
me
i
ventured
to
observe
she
was
not
offended
but
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
stood
looking
at
me
a
moment
then
you
should
not
have
gone
away
she
exclaimed
i
stayed
for
another
hour
it
is
a
very
pleasant
house
two
or
three
of
the
men
who
were
sitting
there
seemed
very
civil
and
intelligent
one
of
them
was
a
major
of
engineers
who
offered
me
a
profusion
of
information
upon
the
new
organisation
of
the
italian
army
while
he
talked
however
i
was
observing
our
hostess
who
was
talking
with
the
others
very
little
i
noticed
with
her
young
inglese
she
is
altogether
charming
full
of
frankness
and
freedom
of
that
inimitable
which
in
an
englishwoman
would
be
vulgar
and
which
in
her
is
simply
the
perfection
of
apparent
spontaneity
but
for
all
her
spontaneity
she
as
subtle
as
a
and
knows
tremendously
well
what
she
is
about
if
she
is
not
a
consummate
coquette
what
had
she
in
her
head
when
she
said
that
i
should
not
have
gone
away
poor
little
stanmer
did
go
away
i
left
him
there
at
midnight
i
found
him
today
sitting
in
the
church
of
santa
croce
into
which
i
wandered
to
escape
from
the
heat
of
the
sun
in
the
nave
it
was
cool
and
dim
he
was
staring
at
the
blaze
of
candles
on
the
great
altar
and
thinking
i
am
sure
of
his
incomparable
countess
i
sat
down
beside
him
and
after
a
while
as
if
to
avoid
the
appearance
of
eagerness
he
asked
me
how
i
had
enjoyed
my
visit
to
casa
salvi
and
what
i
thought
of
the
i
think
half
a
dozen
things
i
said
but
i
can
only
tell
you
one
now
she
an
enchantress
you
shall
hear
the
rest
when
we
have
left
the
church
an
enchantress
repeated
stanmer
looking
at
me
askance
he
is
a
very
simple
youth
but
who
am
i
to
blame
him
a
charmer
i
said
a
fascinatress
he
turned
away
staring
at
the
altar
candles
an
artist
an
actress
i
went
on
rather
brutally
he
gave
me
another
glance
i
think
you
are
telling
me
all
he
said
no
no
there
is
more
and
we
sat
a
long
time
in
silence
at
last
he
proposed
that
we
should
go
out
and
we
passed
in
the
street
where
the
shadows
had
begun
to
stretch
themselves
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
her
being
an
actress
he
said
as
we
turned
homeward
i
suppose
not
neither
should
i
have
known
if
any
one
had
said
that
to
me
you
are
thinking
about
the
mother
said
stanmer
why
are
you
always
bringing
in
my
dear
boy
the
analogy
is
so
great
it
forces
itself
upon
me
he
stopped
and
stood
looking
at
me
with
his
modest
perplexed
young
face
i
thought
he
was
going
to
exclaim
the
analogy
be
hanged
but
he
said
after
a
moment
well
what
does
it
prove
i
ca
say
it
proves
anything
but
it
suggests
a
great
many
things
be
so
good
as
to
mention
a
few
he
said
as
we
walked
on
you
are
not
sure
of
her
yourself
i
began
never
mind
that
go
on
with
your
analogy
that
a
part
of
it
you
very
much
in
love
with
her
that
a
part
of
it
too
i
suppose
yes
as
i
have
told
you
before
you
are
in
love
with
her
and
yet
you
ca
make
her
out
that
just
where
i
was
with
regard
to
madame
de
salvi
and
she
too
was
an
enchantress
an
actress
an
artist
and
all
the
rest
of
it
she
was
the
most
perfect
coquette
i
ever
knew
and
the
most
dangerous
because
the
most
finished
what
you
mean
then
is
that
her
daughter
is
a
finished
coquette
i
rather
think
so
stanmer
walked
along
for
some
moments
in
silence
seeing
that
you
suppose
me
to
be
a
a
great
admirer
of
the
countess
he
said
at
last
i
am
rather
surprised
at
the
freedom
with
which
you
speak
of
her
i
confessed
that
i
was
surprised
at
it
myself
but
it
on
account
of
the
interest
i
take
in
you
i
am
immensely
obliged
to
you
said
the
poor
boy
ah
of
course
you
do
like
it
that
is
you
like
my
interest
i
see
how
you
can
help
liking
that
but
you
do
like
my
freedom
natural
enough
but
my
dear
young
friend
i
want
only
to
help
you
if
a
man
had
said
to
me
so
many
years
ago
what
i
am
saying
to
you
i
should
certainly
also
at
first
have
thought
him
a
great
brute
but
after
a
little
i
should
have
been
grateful
i
should
have
felt
that
he
was
helping
me
you
seem
to
have
been
very
well
able
to
help
yourself
said
stanmer
you
tell
me
you
made
your
escape
yes
but
it
was
at
the
cost
of
infinite
perplexity
of
what
i
may
call
keen
suffering
i
should
like
to
save
you
all
that
i
can
only
repeat
it
is
really
very
kind
of
you
do
repeat
it
too
often
or
i
shall
begin
to
think
you
do
mean
it
well
said
stanmer
i
think
this
at
any
rate
that
you
take
an
extraordinary
responsibility
in
trying
to
put
a
man
out
of
conceit
of
a
woman
who
as
he
believes
may
make
him
very
happy
i
grasped
his
arm
and
we
stopped
going
on
with
our
talk
like
a
couple
of
florentines
do
you
wish
to
marry
her
he
looked
away
without
meeting
my
eyes
it
a
great
responsibility
he
repeated
before
heaven
i
said
i
would
have
married
the
mother
you
are
exactly
in
my
situation
do
you
think
you
rather
overdo
the
analogy
asked
poor
stanmer
a
little
more
a
little
less
it
does
matter
i
believe
you
are
in
my
shoes
but
of
course
if
you
prefer
it
i
will
beg
a
thousand
pardons
and
leave
them
to
carry
you
where
they
will
he
had
been
looking
away
but
now
he
slowly
turned
his
face
and
met
my
eyes
you
have
gone
too
far
to
retreat
what
is
it
you
know
about
her
about
this
one
nothing
but
about
the
other
i
care
nothing
about
the
other
my
dear
fellow
i
said
they
are
mother
and
daughter
they
are
as
like
as
two
of
andrea
madonnas
if
they
resemble
each
other
then
you
were
simply
mistaken
in
the
mother
i
took
his
arm
and
we
walked
on
again
there
seemed
no
adequate
reply
to
such
a
charge
your
state
of
mind
brings
back
my
own
so
completely
i
said
presently
you
admire
her
you
adore
her
and
yet
secretly
you
mistrust
her
you
are
enchanted
with
her
personal
charm
her
grace
her
wit
her
everything
and
yet
in
your
private
heart
you
are
afraid
of
her
afraid
of
her
your
mistrust
keeps
rising
to
the
surface
you
ca
rid
yourself
of
the
suspicion
that
at
the
bottom
of
all
things
she
is
hard
and
cruel
and
you
would
be
immensely
relieved
if
some
one
should
persuade
you
that
your
suspicion
is
right
stanmer
made
no
direct
reply
to
this
but
before
we
reached
the
hotel
he
said
what
did
you
ever
know
about
the
mother
it
a
terrible
story
i
answered
he
looked
at
me
askance
what
did
she
do
come
to
my
rooms
this
evening
and
i
will
tell
you
he
declared
he
would
but
he
never
came
exactly
the
way
i
should
have
acted
i
went
again
last
evening
to
casa
salvi
where
i
found
the
same
little
circle
with
the
addition
of
a
couple
of
ladies
stanmer
was
there
trying
hard
to
talk
to
one
of
them
but
making
i
am
sure
a
very
poor
business
of
it
the
countess
well
the
countess
was
admirable
she
greeted
me
like
a
friend
of
ten
years
toward
whom
familiarity
should
not
have
engendered
a
want
of
ceremony
she
made
me
sit
near
her
and
she
asked
me
a
dozen
questions
about
my
health
and
my
occupations
i
live
in
the
past
i
said
i
go
into
the
galleries
into
the
old
palaces
and
the
churches
today
i
spent
an
hour
in
michael
chapel
at
san
loreozo
ah
yes
that
the
past
said
the
countess
those
things
are
very
old
years
old
i
answered
i
mean
my
own
past
i
said
i
went
to
a
great
many
of
those
places
with
your
mother
ah
the
pictures
are
beautiful
murmured
the
countess
glancing
at
stanmer
have
you
lately
looked
at
any
of
them
i
asked
have
you
gone
to
the
galleries
with
she
hesitated
a
moment
smiling
it
seems
to
me
that
your
question
is
a
little
impertinent
but
i
think
you
are
like
that
a
little
impertinent
never
as
i
say
your
mother
did
me
the
honour
more
than
once
to
accompany
me
to
the
uffizzi
my
mother
must
have
been
very
kind
to
you
so
it
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
at
the
time
only
well
if
you
prefer
so
it
seems
to
me
now
eh
said
the
countess
she
made
sacrifices
to
what
cara
signora
she
was
perfectly
free
your
lamented
father
was
dead
and
she
had
not
yet
contracted
her
second
marriage
if
she
was
intending
to
marry
again
it
was
all
the
more
reason
she
should
have
been
careful
i
looked
at
her
a
moment
she
met
my
eyes
gravely
over
the
top
of
her
fan
are
very
careful
i
said
she
dropped
her
fan
with
a
certain
violence
ah
yes
you
are
impertinent
ah
no
i
said
remember
that
i
am
old
enough
to
be
your
father
that
i
knew
you
when
you
were
three
years
old
i
may
surely
ask
such
questions
but
you
are
right
one
must
do
your
mother
justice
she
was
certainly
thinking
of
her
second
marriage
you
have
not
forgiven
her
that
said
the
countess
very
gravely
have
you
i
asked
more
lightly
i
do
judge
my
mother
that
is
a
mortal
sin
my
stepfather
was
very
kind
to
me
i
remember
him
i
said
i
saw
him
a
great
many
times
your
mother
already
received
him
my
hostess
sat
with
lowered
eyes
saying
nothing
but
she
presently
looked
up
she
was
very
unhappy
with
my
father
that
i
can
easily
believe
and
your
stepfather
is
he
still
living
he
died
before
my
mother
did
he
fight
any
more
duels
he
was
killed
in
a
duel
said
the
countess
discreetly
it
seems
almost
monstrous
especially
as
i
can
give
no
reason
for
it
but
this
announcement
instead
of
shocking
me
caused
me
to
feel
a
strange
exhilaration
most
assuredly
after
all
these
years
i
bear
the
poor
man
no
resentment
of
course
i
controlled
my
manner
and
simply
remarked
to
the
countess
that
as
his
fault
had
been
so
was
his
punishment
i
think
however
that
the
feeling
of
which
i
speak
was
at
the
bottom
of
my
saying
to
her
that
i
hoped
that
unlike
her
mother
her
own
brief
married
life
had
been
happy
if
it
was
not
she
said
i
have
forgotten
it
now
i
wonder
if
the
late
count
scarabelli
was
also
killed
in
a
duel
and
if
his
adversary
is
it
on
the
books
that
his
adversary
as
well
shall
perish
by
the
pistol
which
of
those
gentlemen
is
he
i
wonder
is
it
reserved
for
poor
little
stanmer
to
put
a
bullet
into
him
no
poor
little
stanmer
i
trust
will
do
as
i
did
and
yet
unfortunately
for
him
that
woman
is
consummately
plausible
she
was
wonderfully
nice
last
evening
she
was
really
irresistible
such
frankness
and
freedom
and
yet
something
so
soft
and
womanly
such
graceful
gaiety
so
much
of
the
brightness
without
any
of
the
stiffness
of
good
breeding
and
over
it
all
something
so
picturesquely
simple
and
southern
she
is
a
perfect
italian
but
she
comes
honestly
by
it
after
the
talk
i
have
just
jotted
down
she
changed
her
place
and
the
conversation
for
half
an
hour
was
general
stanmer
indeed
said
very
little
partly
i
suppose
because
he
is
shy
of
talking
a
foreign
tongue
was
i
like
that
was
i
so
constantly
silent
i
suspect
i
was
when
i
was
perplexed
and
heaven
knows
that
very
often
my
perplexity
was
extreme
before
i
went
away
i
had
a
few
more
words
with
the
countess
i
hope
you
are
not
leaving
florence
yet
she
said
you
will
stay
a
while
longer
i
answered
that
i
came
only
for
a
week
and
that
my
week
was
over
i
stay
on
from
day
to
day
i
am
so
much
interested
eh
it
the
beautiful
moment
i
glad
our
city
pleases
you
florence
pleases
me
and
i
take
a
paternal
interest
to
our
young
friend
i
added
glancing
at
stanmer
i
have
become
very
fond
of
him
tipo
said
my
hostess
and
he
is
very
intelligent
he
has
a
beautiful
mind
she
stood
there
resting
her
smile
and
her
clear
expressive
eyes
upon
me
i
do
like
to
praise
him
too
much
i
rejoined
lest
i
should
appear
to
praise
myself
he
reminds
me
so
much
of
what
i
was
at
his
age
if
your
beautiful
mother
were
to
come
to
life
for
an
hour
she
would
see
the
resemblance
she
gave
me
a
little
amused
stare
and
yet
you
do
look
at
all
like
him
ah
you
did
know
me
when
i
was
i
was
very
handsome
and
moreover
it
is
that
it
the
mental
resemblance
i
was
ingenuous
candid
trusting
like
him
trusting
i
remember
my
mother
once
telling
me
that
you
were
the
most
suspicious
and
jealous
of
men
i
fell
into
a
suspicious
mood
but
i
was
fundamentally
not
in
the
least
addicted
to
thinking
evil
i
could
easily
imagine
any
harm
of
any
one
and
so
you
mean
that
stanmer
is
in
a
suspicions
mood
well
i
mean
that
his
situation
is
the
same
as
mine
the
countess
gave
me
one
of
her
serious
looks
come
she
said
what
was
it
this
famous
situation
of
yours
i
have
heard
you
mention
it
before
your
mother
might
have
told
you
since
she
occasionally
did
me
the
honour
to
speak
of
me
all
my
mother
ever
told
me
was
that
you
were
a
sad
puzzle
to
her
at
this
of
course
i
laughed
out
i
laugh
still
as
i
write
it
well
then
that
was
my
situation
i
was
a
sad
puzzle
to
a
very
clever
woman
and
you
mean
therefore
that
i
am
a
puzzle
to
poor
mr
stanmer
he
is
racking
his
brains
to
make
you
out
remember
it
was
you
who
said
he
was
intelligent
she
looked
round
at
him
and
as
fortune
would
have
it
his
appearance
at
that
moment
quite
confirmed
my
assertion
he
was
lounging
back
in
his
chair
with
an
air
of
indolence
rather
too
marked
for
a
and
staring
at
the
ceiling
with
the
expression
of
a
man
who
has
just
been
asked
a
conundrum
madame
scarabelli
seemed
struck
with
his
attitude
do
you
see
i
said
he
ca
read
the
riddle
you
yourself
she
answered
said
he
was
incapable
of
thinking
evil
i
should
be
sorry
to
have
him
think
any
evil
of
and
she
looked
straight
at
me
seriously
appealingly
with
her
beautiful
candid
brow
i
inclined
myself
smiling
in
a
manner
which
might
have
meant
how
could
that
be
possible
i
have
a
great
esteem
for
him
she
went
on
i
want
him
to
think
well
of
me
if
i
am
a
puzzle
to
him
do
me
a
little
service
explain
me
to
him
explain
you
dear
lady
you
are
older
and
wiser
than
he
make
him
understand
me
she
looked
deep
into
my
eyes
for
a
moment
and
then
she
turned
away
i
have
written
nothing
for
a
good
many
days
but
meanwhile
i
have
been
half
a
dozen
times
to
casa
salvi
i
have
seen
a
good
deal
also
of
my
young
friend
had
a
good
many
walks
and
talks
with
him
i
have
proposed
to
him
to
come
with
me
to
venice
for
a
fortnight
but
he
listen
to
the
idea
of
leaving
florence
he
is
very
happy
in
spite
of
his
doubts
and
i
confess
that
in
the
perception
of
his
happiness
i
have
lived
over
again
my
own
this
is
so
much
the
case
that
when
the
other
day
he
at
last
made
up
his
mind
to
ask
me
to
tell
him
the
wrong
that
madame
de
salvi
had
done
me
i
rather
checked
his
curiosity
i
told
him
that
if
he
was
bent
upon
knowing
i
would
satisfy
him
but
that
it
seemed
a
pity
just
now
to
indulge
in
painful
imagery
but
i
thought
you
wanted
so
much
to
put
me
out
of
conceit
of
our
friend
i
admit
i
am
inconsistent
but
there
are
various
reasons
for
it
in
the
first
place
it
obvious
i
am
open
to
the
charge
of
playing
a
double
game
i
profess
an
admiration
for
the
countess
scarabelli
for
i
accept
her
hospitality
and
at
the
same
time
i
attempt
to
poison
your
mind
is
that
the
proper
expression
i
ca
exactly
make
up
my
mind
to
that
though
my
admiration
for
the
countess
and
my
desire
to
prevent
you
from
taking
a
foolish
step
are
equally
sincere
and
then
in
the
second
place
you
seem
to
me
on
the
whole
so
happy
one
hesitates
to
destroy
an
illusion
no
matter
how
pernicious
that
is
so
delightful
while
it
lasts
these
are
the
rare
moments
of
life
to
be
young
and
ardent
in
the
midst
of
an
italian
spring
and
to
believe
in
the
moral
perfection
of
a
beautiful
woman
what
an
admirable
situation
float
with
the
current
i
stand
on
the
brink
and
watch
you
your
real
reason
is
that
you
feel
you
have
no
case
against
the
poor
lady
said
stanmer
you
admire
her
as
much
as
i
do
i
just
admitted
that
i
admired
her
i
never
said
she
was
a
vulgar
flirt
her
mother
was
an
absolutely
scientific
one
heaven
knows
i
admired
that
it
a
nice
point
however
how
much
one
is
hound
in
honour
not
to
warn
a
young
friend
against
a
dangerous
woman
because
one
also
has
relations
of
civility
with
the
lady
in
such
a
case
said
stanmer
i
would
break
off
my
relations
i
looked
at
him
and
i
think
i
laughed
are
you
jealous
of
me
by
chance
he
shook
his
head
emphatically
not
in
the
least
i
like
to
see
you
there
because
your
conduct
contradicts
your
words
i
have
always
said
that
the
countess
is
fascinating
otherwise
said
stanmer
in
the
case
you
speak
of
i
would
give
the
lady
notice
give
her
notice
mention
to
her
that
you
regard
her
with
suspicion
and
that
you
propose
to
do
your
best
to
rescue
a
youth
from
her
wiles
that
would
be
more
loyal
and
he
began
to
laugh
again
it
is
not
the
first
time
he
has
laughed
at
me
but
i
have
never
minded
it
because
i
have
always
understood
it
is
that
what
you
recommend
me
to
say
to
the
countess
i
asked
recommend
you
he
exclaimed
laughing
again
i
recommend
nothing
i
may
be
the
victim
to
be
rescued
but
i
am
at
least
not
a
partner
to
the
conspiracy
besides
he
added
in
a
moment
the
countess
knows
your
state
of
mind
has
she
told
you
so
stanmer
hesitated
she
has
begged
me
to
listen
to
everything
you
may
say
against
her
she
declares
that
she
has
a
good
conscience
ah
said
i
she
an
accomplished
woman
and
it
is
indeed
very
clever
of
her
to
take
that
tone
stanmer
afterwards
assured
me
explicitly
that
he
has
never
given
her
a
hint
of
the
liberties
i
have
taken
in
conversation
with
what
shall
i
call
it
with
her
moral
nature
she
has
guessed
them
for
herself
she
must
hate
me
intensely
and
yet
her
manner
has
always
been
so
charming
to
me
she
is
truly
an
accomplished
woman
may
i
have
stayed
away
from
casa
salvi
for
a
week
but
i
have
lingered
on
in
florence
under
a
mixture
of
impulses
i
have
had
it
on
my
conscience
not
to
go
near
the
countess
again
and
yet
from
the
moment
she
is
aware
of
the
way
i
feel
about
her
it
is
open
war
there
need
be
no
scruples
on
either
side
she
is
as
free
to
use
every
possible
art
to
entangle
poor
stanmer
more
closely
as
i
am
to
clip
her
meshes
under
the
circumstances
however
we
naturally
should
meet
very
cordially
but
as
regards
her
meshes
why
after
all
should
i
clip
them
it
would
really
be
very
interesting
to
see
stanmer
swallowed
up
i
should
like
to
see
how
he
would
agree
with
her
after
she
had
devoured
him
to
what
vulgar
imagery
by
the
way
does
curiosity
reduce
a
man
let
him
finish
the
story
in
his
own
way
as
i
finished
it
in
mine
it
is
the
same
story
but
why
a
quarter
of
a
century
later
should
it
have
the
same
let
him
make
his
own
hang
it
however
i
do
want
the
poor
boy
to
be
miserable
ah
but
did
my
then
prove
such
a
happy
one
he
came
to
my
room
late
last
night
he
was
much
excited
what
was
it
she
did
to
you
he
asked
i
answered
him
first
with
another
question
have
you
quarrelled
with
the
countess
but
he
only
repeated
his
own
what
was
it
she
did
to
you
sit
down
and
i
tell
you
and
he
sat
there
beside
the
candle
staring
at
me
there
was
a
man
always
there
count
camerino
the
man
she
married
the
man
she
married
i
was
very
much
in
love
with
her
and
yet
i
trust
her
i
was
sure
that
she
lied
i
believed
that
she
could
be
cruel
nevertheless
at
moments
she
had
a
charm
which
made
it
pure
pedantry
to
be
conscious
of
her
faults
and
while
these
moments
lasted
i
would
have
done
anything
for
her
unfortunately
they
did
last
long
but
you
know
what
i
mean
am
i
not
describing
the
scarabelli
the
countess
scarabelli
never
lied
cried
stanmer
that
just
what
i
would
have
said
to
any
one
who
should
have
made
the
insinutation
but
i
suppose
you
are
not
asking
me
the
question
you
put
to
me
just
now
from
dispassionate
curiosity
a
man
may
want
to
know
said
the
innocent
fellow
i
could
help
laughing
out
this
at
any
rate
is
my
story
camerino
was
always
there
he
was
a
sort
of
fixture
in
the
house
if
i
had
moments
of
dislike
for
the
divine
bianca
i
had
no
moments
of
liking
for
him
and
yet
he
was
a
very
agreeable
fellow
very
civil
very
intelligent
not
in
the
least
disposed
to
make
a
quarrel
with
me
the
trouble
of
course
was
simply
that
i
was
jealous
of
him
i
do
know
however
on
what
ground
i
could
have
quarrelled
with
him
for
i
had
no
definite
rights
i
ca
say
what
i
expected
i
ca
say
what
as
the
matter
stood
i
was
prepared
to
do
with
my
name
and
my
prospects
i
might
perfectly
have
offered
her
my
hand
i
am
not
sure
that
she
would
have
accepted
it
i
am
by
no
means
clear
that
she
wanted
that
but
she
wanted
wanted
keenly
to
attach
me
to
her
she
wanted
to
have
me
about
i
should
have
been
capable
of
giving
up
everything
england
my
career
my
family
simply
to
devote
myself
to
her
to
live
near
her
and
see
her
every
day
why
did
you
do
it
then
asked
stanmer
why
do
you
to
be
a
proper
rejoinder
to
my
question
he
said
rather
neatly
yours
should
be
asked
years
hence
it
remains
perfectly
true
that
at
a
given
moment
i
was
capable
of
doing
as
i
say
that
was
what
she
wanted
a
rich
susceptible
credulous
convenient
young
englishman
established
near
her
and
yet
i
added
i
must
do
her
complete
justice
i
honestly
believe
she
was
fond
of
me
at
this
stanmer
got
up
and
walked
to
the
window
he
stood
looking
out
a
moment
and
then
he
turned
round
you
know
she
was
older
than
i
i
went
on
madame
scarabelli
is
older
than
you
one
day
in
the
garden
her
mother
asked
me
in
an
angry
tone
why
i
disliked
camerino
for
i
had
been
at
no
pains
to
conceal
my
feeling
about
him
and
something
had
just
happened
to
bring
it
out
dislike
him
i
said
you
like
him
so
much
assure
you
i
do
like
him
she
answered
has
all
the
appearance
of
being
your
lover
i
retorted
it
was
a
brutal
speech
certainly
but
any
other
man
in
my
place
would
have
made
it
she
took
it
very
strangely
she
turned
pale
but
she
was
not
indignant
can
he
be
my
lover
after
what
he
has
done
she
asked
has
he
done
she
hesitated
a
good
while
then
she
said
killed
my
husband
heavens
i
cried
you
receive
him
do
you
know
what
she
said
she
said
is
that
all
asked
stanmer
no
she
went
on
to
say
that
camerino
had
killed
count
salvi
in
a
duel
and
she
admitted
that
her
husband
jealousy
had
been
the
occasion
of
it
the
count
it
appeared
was
a
monster
of
jealousy
he
had
led
her
a
dreadful
life
he
himself
meanwhile
had
been
anything
but
irreproachable
he
had
done
a
mortal
injury
to
a
man
of
whom
he
pretended
to
be
a
friend
and
this
affair
had
become
notorious
the
gentleman
in
question
had
demanded
satisfaction
for
his
outraged
honour
but
for
some
reason
or
other
the
countess
to
do
her
justice
did
not
tell
me
that
her
husband
was
a
coward
he
had
not
as
yet
obtained
it
the
duel
with
camerino
had
come
on
first
in
an
access
of
jealous
fury
the
count
had
struck
camerino
in
the
face
and
this
outrage
i
know
not
how
justly
was
deemed
expiable
before
the
other
by
an
extraordinary
arrangement
the
italians
have
certainly
no
sense
of
fair
play
the
other
man
was
allowed
to
be
camerino
second
the
duel
was
fought
with
swords
and
the
count
received
a
wound
of
which
though
at
first
it
was
not
expected
to
be
fatal
he
died
on
the
following
day
the
matter
was
hushed
up
as
much
as
possible
for
the
sake
of
the
countess
good
name
and
so
successfully
that
it
was
presently
observed
that
among
the
public
the
other
gentleman
had
the
credit
of
having
put
his
blade
through
de
salvi
this
gentleman
took
a
fancy
not
to
contradict
the
impression
and
it
was
allowed
to
subsist
so
long
as
he
consented
it
was
of
course
in
camerino
interest
not
to
contradict
it
as
it
left
him
much
more
free
to
keep
up
his
intimacy
with
the
countess
stanmer
had
listened
to
all
this
with
extreme
attention
why
contradict
it
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
i
am
bound
to
believe
it
was
for
the
same
reason
i
was
horrified
at
any
rate
by
the
whole
story
i
was
extremely
shocked
at
the
countess
want
of
dignity
in
continuing
to
see
the
man
by
whose
hand
her
husband
had
fallen
the
husband
had
been
a
great
brute
and
it
was
not
known
said
stanmer
its
not
being
known
made
no
difference
and
as
for
salvi
having
been
a
brute
that
is
but
a
way
of
saying
that
his
wife
and
the
man
whom
his
wife
subsequently
married
did
like
him
stanmer
hooked
extremely
meditative
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
mine
yes
that
marriage
is
hard
to
get
over
it
was
not
becoming
ah
said
i
what
a
long
breath
i
drew
when
i
heard
of
it
i
remember
the
place
and
the
hour
it
was
at
a
in
india
seven
years
after
i
had
left
florence
the
post
brought
me
some
english
papers
and
in
one
of
them
was
a
letter
from
italy
with
a
lot
of
intelligence
there
among
various
scandals
in
high
life
and
other
delectable
items
i
read
that
the
countess
bianca
salvi
famous
for
some
years
as
the
presiding
genius
of
the
most
agreeable
seen
in
florence
was
about
to
bestow
her
hand
upon
count
camerino
a
distinguished
bolognese
ah
my
dear
boy
it
was
a
tremendous
escape
i
had
been
ready
to
marry
the
woman
who
was
capable
of
that
but
my
instinct
had
warned
me
and
i
had
trusted
my
instinct
everything
as
falstaff
says
and
stanmer
began
to
laugh
did
you
tell
madame
de
salvi
that
your
instinct
was
against
her
no
i
told
her
that
she
frightened
me
shocked
me
horrified
me
that
about
the
same
thing
and
what
did
she
say
she
asked
me
what
i
would
have
i
called
her
friendship
with
camerino
a
scandal
and
she
answered
that
her
husband
had
been
a
brute
besides
no
one
knew
it
therefore
it
was
no
scandal
just
argument
i
retorted
that
this
was
odious
reasoning
and
that
she
had
no
moral
sense
we
had
a
passionate
argument
and
i
declared
i
would
never
see
her
again
in
the
heat
of
my
displeasure
i
left
florence
and
i
kept
my
vow
i
never
saw
her
again
you
could
have
been
much
in
love
with
her
said
stanmer
i
was
not
three
months
after
if
you
had
been
you
would
have
come
back
three
days
after
so
doubtless
it
seems
to
you
all
i
can
say
is
that
it
was
the
great
effort
of
my
life
being
a
military
man
i
have
had
on
various
occasions
to
face
time
enemy
but
it
was
not
then
i
needed
my
resolution
it
was
when
i
left
florence
in
a
stanmer
turned
about
the
room
two
or
three
times
and
then
he
said
i
do
understand
i
do
understand
why
she
should
have
told
you
that
camerino
had
killed
her
husband
it
could
only
damage
her
she
was
afraid
it
would
damage
her
more
that
i
should
think
he
was
her
lover
she
wished
to
say
the
thing
that
would
most
effectually
persuade
me
that
he
was
not
her
lover
that
he
could
never
be
and
then
she
wished
to
get
the
credit
of
being
very
frank
good
heavens
how
you
must
have
analysed
her
cried
my
companion
staring
there
is
nothing
so
analytic
as
disillusionment
but
there
it
is
she
married
camerino
yes
i
do
lime
that
said
stanmer
he
was
silent
a
while
and
then
he
added
perhaps
she
would
have
done
so
if
you
had
remained
he
has
a
little
innocent
way
very
likely
she
would
have
dispensed
with
the
ceremony
i
answered
drily
upon
my
word
he
said
you
analysed
her
you
ought
to
be
grateful
to
me
i
have
done
for
you
what
you
seem
unable
to
do
for
yourself
i
do
see
any
camerino
in
my
case
he
said
perhaps
among
those
gentlemen
i
can
find
one
for
you
thank
you
he
cried
i
take
care
of
that
myself
and
he
went
away
satisfied
i
hope
he
an
obstinate
little
wretch
it
irritates
me
to
see
him
sticking
to
it
perhaps
he
is
looking
for
his
camerino
i
shall
leave
him
at
any
rate
to
his
fate
it
is
growing
insupportably
hot
i
went
this
evening
to
bid
farewell
to
the
scarabelli
there
was
no
one
there
she
was
alone
in
her
great
dusky
which
was
lighted
only
by
a
couple
of
candles
with
the
immense
windows
open
over
the
garden
she
was
dressed
in
white
she
was
deucedly
pretty
she
asked
me
of
course
why
i
had
been
so
long
without
coming
i
think
you
say
that
only
for
form
i
answered
i
imagine
you
know
what
have
i
done
nothing
at
all
you
are
too
wise
for
that
she
looked
at
me
a
while
i
think
you
are
a
little
crazy
ah
no
i
am
only
too
sane
i
have
too
much
reason
rather
than
too
little
you
have
at
any
rate
what
we
call
a
fixed
idea
there
is
no
harm
in
that
so
long
as
it
a
good
one
but
yours
is
abominable
she
exclaimed
with
a
laugh
of
course
you
ca
like
me
or
my
ideas
all
things
considered
you
have
treated
me
with
wonderful
kindness
and
i
thank
you
and
kiss
your
hands
i
leave
florence
tomorrow
i
wo
say
i
sorry
she
said
laughing
again
but
i
am
very
glad
to
have
seen
you
i
always
wondered
about
you
you
are
a
curiosity
yes
you
must
find
me
so
a
man
who
can
resist
your
charms
the
fact
is
i
ca
this
evening
you
are
enchanting
and
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
been
alone
with
you
she
gave
no
heed
to
this
she
turned
away
but
in
a
moment
she
came
back
and
stood
looking
at
me
and
her
beautiful
solemn
eyes
seemed
to
shine
in
the
dimness
of
the
room
how
you
treat
my
mother
so
she
asked
treat
her
so
how
could
you
desert
the
most
charming
woman
in
the
world
it
was
not
a
case
of
desertion
and
if
it
had
been
it
seems
to
me
she
was
consoled
at
this
moment
there
was
the
sound
of
a
step
in
the
and
i
saw
that
the
countess
perceived
it
to
be
stanmer
that
would
have
happened
she
murmured
my
poor
mother
needed
a
protector
stanmer
came
in
interrupting
our
talk
and
looking
at
me
i
thought
with
a
little
air
of
bravado
he
must
think
me
indeed
a
tiresome
meddlesome
bore
and
upon
my
word
turning
it
all
over
i
wonder
at
his
docility
after
all
he
and
yet
i
add
it
irritate
me
the
way
he
sticks
he
was
followed
in
a
moment
by
two
or
three
of
the
regular
italians
and
i
made
my
visit
short
countess
i
said
and
she
gave
me
her
hand
in
silence
do
you
need
a
protector
i
added
softly
she
looked
at
me
from
head
to
foot
and
then
almost
angrily
yes
signore
but
to
deprecate
her
anger
i
kept
her
hand
an
instant
and
then
bent
my
venerable
head
and
kissed
it
i
think
i
appeased
her
bologna
i
left
florence
on
the
and
have
been
here
these
three
days
delightful
old
italian
town
but
it
lacks
the
charm
of
my
florentine
secret
i
wrote
that
last
entry
five
days
ago
late
at
night
after
coming
back
from
casa
salsi
i
afterwards
fell
asleep
in
my
chair
the
night
was
half
over
when
i
woke
up
instead
of
going
to
bed
i
stood
a
long
time
at
the
window
looking
out
at
the
river
it
was
a
warm
still
night
and
the
first
faint
streaks
of
sunrise
were
in
the
sky
presently
i
heard
a
slow
footstep
beneath
my
window
and
looking
down
made
out
by
the
aid
of
a
street
lamp
that
stanmer
was
but
just
coming
home
i
called
to
him
to
come
to
my
rooms
and
after
an
interval
he
made
his
appearance
i
want
to
bid
you
i
said
i
shall
depart
in
the
morning
do
go
to
the
trouble
of
saying
you
are
sorry
of
course
you
are
not
i
must
have
bullied
you
immensely
he
made
no
attempt
to
say
he
was
sorry
but
he
said
he
was
very
glad
to
have
made
my
acquaintance
your
conversation
he
said
with
his
little
innocent
air
has
been
very
suggestive
have
you
found
camerino
i
asked
smiling
i
have
given
up
the
search
well
i
said
some
day
when
you
find
that
you
have
made
a
great
mistake
remember
i
told
you
so
he
looked
for
a
minute
as
if
he
were
trying
to
anticipate
that
day
by
the
exercise
of
his
reason
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
that
may
have
made
a
great
mistake
oh
yes
everything
occurs
to
one
sooner
or
later
that
what
i
said
to
him
but
i
did
say
that
the
question
pointed
by
his
candid
young
countenance
had
for
the
moment
a
greater
force
than
it
had
ever
had
before
and
then
he
asked
me
whether
as
things
had
turned
out
i
myself
had
been
so
especially
happy
paris
a
note
from
young
stanmer
whom
i
saw
in
florence
a
remarkable
little
note
dated
rome
and
worth
transcribing
my
dear
general
i
have
it
at
heart
to
tell
you
that
i
was
married
a
week
ago
to
the
countess
you
talked
me
into
a
great
muddle
but
a
month
after
that
it
was
all
very
clear
things
that
involve
a
risk
are
like
the
christian
faith
they
must
be
seen
from
the
yours
ever
a
fig
for
analogies
unless
you
can
find
an
analogy
for
my
happiness
his
happiness
makes
him
very
clever
i
hope
it
will
last
i
mean
his
cleverness
not
his
happiness
london
last
night
at
lady
h
i
met
edmund
stanmer
who
married
bianca
salvi
daughter
i
heard
the
other
day
that
they
had
come
to
england
a
handsome
young
fellow
with
a
fresh
contented
face
he
reminded
me
of
florence
which
i
did
pretend
to
forget
but
it
was
rather
awkward
for
i
remember
i
used
to
disparage
that
woman
to
him
i
had
a
complete
theory
about
her
but
he
seem
at
all
stiff
on
the
contrary
he
appeared
to
enjoy
our
encounter
i
asked
him
if
his
wife
were
there
i
had
to
do
that
oh
yes
she
in
one
of
the
other
rooms
come
and
make
her
acquaintance
i
want
you
to
know
her
you
forget
that
i
do
know
her
oh
no
you
do
you
never
did
and
he
gave
a
little
significant
laugh
i
did
feel
like
facing
the
scarabelli
at
that
moment
so
i
said
that
i
was
leaving
the
house
but
that
i
would
do
myself
the
honour
of
calling
upon
his
wife
we
talked
for
a
minute
of
something
else
and
then
suddenly
breaking
off
and
looking
at
me
he
laid
his
hand
on
my
arm
i
must
do
him
the
justice
to
say
that
he
looks
felicitous
depend
upon
it
you
were
wrong
he
said
my
dear
young
friend
i
answered
imagine
the
alacrity
with
which
i
concede
it
something
else
again
was
spoken
of
but
in
an
instant
he
repeated
his
movement
depend
upon
it
you
were
wrong
i
am
sure
the
countess
has
forgiven
me
i
said
and
in
that
case
you
ought
to
bear
no
grudge
as
i
have
had
the
honour
to
say
i
will
call
upon
her
immediately
i
was
not
alluding
to
my
wife
he
answered
i
was
thinking
of
your
own
story
my
own
story
so
many
years
ago
was
it
not
rather
a
mistake
i
looked
at
him
a
moment
he
positively
rosy
that
not
a
question
to
solve
in
a
london
crush
and
i
turned
away
i
have
yet
called
on
the
i
am
afraid
of
finding
her
at
home
and
that
boy
words
have
been
thrumming
in
my
ears
depend
upon
it
you
were
wrong
was
it
rather
a
mistake
i
wrong
it
a
mistake
was
i
too
cautions
too
suspicious
too
logical
was
it
really
a
protector
she
needed
a
man
who
might
have
helped
her
would
it
have
been
for
his
benefit
to
believe
in
her
and
was
her
fault
only
that
i
had
forsaken
her
was
the
poor
woman
very
unhappy
god
forgive
me
how
the
questions
come
crowding
in
if
i
marred
her
happiness
i
certainly
did
make
my
own
and
i
might
have
made
it
eh
that
a
charming
discovery
for
a
man
of
my
age
