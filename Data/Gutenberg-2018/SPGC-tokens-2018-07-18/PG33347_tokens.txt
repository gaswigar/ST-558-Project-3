aubrey
beardsley
aubrey
beardsley
was
born
on
august
at
brighton
he
was
a
quiet
reserved
child
caring
little
for
lessons
though
from
an
early
age
he
shewed
an
aptitude
for
drawing
he
began
his
education
at
a
kindergarten
he
was
seven
years
old
when
the
first
symptoms
of
delicacy
appeared
and
he
was
sent
to
a
preparatory
school
at
hurstpierpoint
where
he
was
remarkable
for
his
courage
and
extreme
reserve
threatened
with
tuberculosis
he
was
moved
for
his
health
to
epsom
in
in
march
his
family
settled
in
london
and
beardsley
made
his
first
public
appearance
as
an
infant
musical
phenomenon
playing
at
concerts
in
company
with
his
sister
he
had
a
great
knowledge
of
music
and
always
spoke
dogmatically
on
a
subject
the
only
one
he
used
to
say
of
which
he
knew
anything
he
became
attracted
at
this
time
by
miss
kate
greenaway
picture
books
and
started
illuminating
menus
and
invitation
cards
with
coloured
chalks
making
by
this
means
quite
considerable
sums
for
a
child
in
august
he
and
his
sister
were
sent
back
to
brighton
where
they
resided
with
an
old
aunt
their
lives
were
lonely
and
beardsley
developed
a
taste
for
reading
of
a
rather
serious
kind
the
histories
of
freeman
and
greene
being
his
favourite
works
he
could
not
remain
a
student
without
creating
so
he
started
a
history
of
the
armada
in
november
of
the
same
year
he
was
sent
to
the
brighton
grammar
school
as
a
day
boy
becoming
a
boarder
in
january
he
was
a
great
favourite
with
mr
king
the
who
encouraged
his
tastes
for
reading
and
drawing
by
giving
him
the
use
of
a
and
the
run
of
a
library
this
was
one
of
the
first
pieces
of
luck
that
attended
beardsley
throughout
life
the
mr
marshall
i
am
told
would
hold
him
up
as
an
example
to
the
other
boys
on
account
of
his
industry
his
caricatures
of
the
masters
were
fully
appreciated
by
them
a
rare
occurrence
in
the
lives
of
artists
he
cultivated
besides
a
talent
for
acting
and
would
often
perform
before
large
audiences
at
the
pavilion
he
organized
weekly
performances
at
the
school
designing
and
illustrating
the
programmes
he
even
wrote
a
farce
called
a
brown
study
which
was
played
at
brighton
where
it
received
serious
attention
from
the
dramatic
critics
of
the
town
he
would
purchase
each
volume
of
the
mermaid
series
of
elizabethan
dramatists
then
being
issued
and
with
his
sister
gave
performances
during
the
holidays
from
the
record
of
the
brighton
college
magazine
beardsley
appears
to
have
taken
a
leading
rôle
in
all
histrionic
fêtes
and
to
the
pied
piper
of
hamelin
he
contributed
some
delightful
and
racy
little
sketches
the
first
of
his
drawings
i
believe
that
were
ever
reproduced
illustration
siegfried
from
the
original
in
the
possession
of
bealby
in
july
he
left
school
and
almost
immediately
entered
an
architect
office
in
london
in
he
obtained
a
post
in
the
guardian
life
and
fire
insurance
during
the
autumn
of
that
year
the
fatal
hæmorrhages
commenced
for
two
years
he
gave
up
his
amateur
theatricals
and
did
little
in
the
way
of
drawing
in
however
he
recuperated
a
belief
in
his
own
powers
revived
he
now
commenced
a
whole
series
of
illustrations
to
various
plays
such
as
marlowe
tamerlane
congreve
way
of
the
world
and
various
french
works
which
he
was
able
to
enjoy
in
the
original
he
would
often
speak
of
the
encouragement
and
kindness
he
received
at
this
period
from
the
rev
alfred
gurney
who
had
known
his
family
at
brighton
and
who
was
perhaps
the
earliest
of
his
friends
to
realize
that
beardsley
possessed
something
more
than
mere
cleverness
or
precocity
several
people
have
claimed
to
discover
aubrey
beardsley
but
i
think
it
truer
to
say
that
he
revealed
himself
when
proper
acknowledgment
has
been
made
to
mr
aymer
vallance
mr
joseph
pennell
mr
frederick
evans
mr
dent
and
mr
john
lane
with
whom
beardsley
art
will
always
be
associated
in
connection
with
the
yellow
book
that
too
early
daffodil
that
came
before
the
swallow
dared
and
could
not
take
the
winds
of
march
for
beauty
to
mr
pennell
belongs
the
credit
of
introducing
art
to
the
public
and
to
mr
dent
is
due
the
rare
distinction
of
giving
him
practical
encouragement
by
commissioning
the
illustrations
to
the
morte
long
before
critics
had
written
anything
about
him
or
any
but
a
few
friends
knew
of
his
great
powers
beardsley
was
too
remarkable
a
personality
to
remain
in
obscurity
though
i
remember
with
some
amusement
how
the
editor
of
a
weekly
mocked
at
a
prophecy
that
the
artist
was
a
coming
man
who
would
very
shortly
excite
discussion
if
not
admiration
fortunately
mr
pennell
a
distinguished
artist
himself
and
a
fearless
critic
not
only
espoused
the
cause
of
the
new
draughtsman
but
became
a
personal
friend
for
whom
beardsley
always
evinced
great
affection
and
to
whom
he
dedicated
his
album
of
fifty
drawings
illustration
the
woman
in
the
moon
salome
i
shall
never
forget
my
first
meeting
with
aubrey
beardsley
on
february
at
the
rooms
of
mr
vallance
the
disciple
and
biographer
of
william
morris
though
prepared
for
an
extraordinary
personality
i
never
expected
the
youthful
apparition
which
glided
into
the
room
he
was
shy
nervous
and
without
any
of
the
intellectual
assurance
and
ease
so
characteristic
of
him
eighteen
months
later
when
his
success
was
unquestioned
he
brought
a
portfolio
of
his
marvellous
drawings
in
themselves
an
earnest
of
genius
but
i
hardly
paid
any
attention
to
them
at
first
so
overshadowed
were
they
by
the
strange
and
fascinating
originality
of
their
author
in
two
hours
it
was
not
hard
to
discover
that
beardsley
appearance
did
not
belie
him
he
was
an
intellectual
marcellus
suddenly
matured
his
rather
long
brown
hair
instead
of
being
ébouriffé
as
the
ordinary
genius
is
expected
to
wear
it
was
brushed
smoothly
and
flatly
on
his
head
and
over
part
of
his
immensely
high
and
narrow
brow
his
face
even
then
was
terribly
drawn
and
emaciated
except
in
his
manner
i
do
not
think
his
general
appearance
altered
very
much
in
spite
of
the
and
suffering
borne
with
such
unparalleled
resignation
and
fortitude
he
always
had
a
most
delightful
and
engaging
smile
both
for
friends
and
strangers
he
grew
less
shy
after
half
an
hour
becoming
gayer
and
more
talkative
he
was
full
of
molière
and
manon
lescaut
at
the
time
he
seemed
disappointed
that
none
of
us
was
musical
but
he
astonished
by
his
knowledge
of
balzac
an
authority
on
the
subject
who
was
also
present
he
spoke
much
of
the
national
gallery
and
the
british
museum
both
of
which
he
knew
with
extraordinary
thoroughness
he
told
me
he
had
only
been
once
to
the
new
gallery
where
he
saw
some
pictures
by
but
had
never
been
to
the
royal
academy
as
far
as
i
know
he
never
visited
the
spring
shows
of
burlington
house
he
always
however
defended
that
institution
with
enthusiasm
saying
he
would
rather
be
an
academician
than
an
artist
as
it
takes
only
one
man
to
make
an
artist
but
forty
to
make
an
academician
our
next
meeting
was
a
few
weeks
later
when
he
brought
me
a
replica
of
his
of
i
was
anxious
to
buy
the
first
and
better
version
now
in
the
possession
of
mr
frederick
evans
but
he
refused
to
part
with
it
at
the
time
he
seemed
particularly
proud
of
the
drawing
it
was
the
only
work
of
this
period
he
would
allow
to
have
any
merit
in
the
early
summer
of
he
visited
and
watts
receiving
from
the
former
artist
cordial
recognition
and
excellent
advice
which
proved
invaluable
to
him
he
attributed
to
the
same
great
painter
the
criticism
that
he
had
learnt
too
much
from
the
old
masters
and
would
benefit
by
the
training
of
an
art
school
a
few
days
afterwards
he
produced
a
most
amusing
caricature
of
himself
being
kicked
down
the
stairs
of
the
national
gallery
by
raphael
titian
and
mantegna
whilst
michael
angelo
dealt
a
blow
on
his
head
with
a
hammer
this
entertaining
little
record
i
am
sorry
to
say
was
destroyed
beardsley
was
always
sensible
about
friendly
and
intelligent
criticism
when
he
reached
a
position
enjoyed
by
no
artist
of
his
own
age
he
was
swift
to
remedy
any
defect
pointed
out
to
him
by
artists
or
even
by
ordinary
friends
i
never
met
anyone
so
receptive
on
all
subjects
he
would
record
what
mr
pennell
or
puvis
de
chavannes
said
in
praise
or
blame
of
a
particular
drawing
with
equal
candour
and
good
humour
this
was
only
one
of
his
many
amiable
qualities
when
he
afterwards
became
a
sort
of
household
word
and
his
fame
or
notoriety
as
his
enemies
called
it
was
established
he
never
changed
in
this
respect
he
made
friends
and
remained
friends
with
many
for
whom
his
art
was
totally
unintelligible
social
charm
triumphed
over
all
differences
he
would
speak
with
enthusiasm
about
writers
and
artists
quite
out
of
sympathy
with
his
own
aims
and
aspirations
he
never
assumed
that
those
to
whom
he
was
introduced
either
knew
or
admired
his
work
his
character
was
brisk
and
virile
to
an
extraordinary
degree
he
made
enemies
i
believe
by
refusing
to
revolve
in
mutual
admiration
societies
or
to
support
literary
and
artistic
cliques
with
the
shadow
of
death
always
over
him
and
conscious
of
the
brief
time
before
him
he
never
gave
himself
up
to
morbid
despair
or
useless
complaints
he
determined
to
enjoy
life
and
equipped
with
all
the
curiosity
and
gaiety
of
boyhood
he
caught
at
life
exquisite
moments
there
was
always
a
very
deep
and
sincere
religious
vein
in
his
temperament
only
noticeable
to
very
intimate
friends
with
all
his
power
of
grasping
the
essential
and
absorbing
knowledge
he
remained
charmingly
unsophisticated
he
took
people
as
they
came
never
discriminating
perhaps
sufficiently
the
issues
of
life
he
was
unspoiled
by
success
unburdened
with
worldly
wisdom
he
was
generous
to
a
fault
spending
his
money
lavishly
on
his
friends
to
an
extent
that
became
almost
embarrassing
illustration
the
toilette
of
salome
salome
his
love
and
knowledge
of
books
increased
rather
than
diminished
even
after
he
devoted
himself
entirely
to
art
in
early
days
he
would
exchange
his
drawings
for
illustrated
books
and
critical
texts
of
the
english
classics
with
mr
frederick
evans
an
early
and
enthusiastic
buyer
of
his
work
his
tastes
were
not
narrow
poetry
memoirs
history
short
stories
biography
and
essays
of
all
kinds
appealed
to
him
but
he
cared
little
for
novels
except
in
french
i
do
think
he
ever
read
dickens
thackeray
and
george
eliot
though
he
enjoyed
scott
during
the
last
months
of
his
life
he
had
an
early
predilection
for
lives
of
the
saints
the
of
sketches
containing
drawings
done
prior
to
indicates
the
range
and
extent
of
his
taste
there
are
illustrations
to
manon
lescaut
tartarin
madame
bovary
balzac
le
cousin
pons
the
contes
drôlatiques
racine
cenci
he
retained
his
love
of
the
drama
and
began
to
write
a
play
in
collaboration
with
mr
brandon
thomas
while
dominated
by
influences
he
read
with
great
avidity
sidonia
the
sorceress
and
the
shaving
of
shagpat
a
favourite
book
of
rossetti
and
it
was
with
a
view
to
illustrate
mr
meredith
arabian
night
that
he
became
introduced
to
mr
john
lane
who
divides
with
mr
herbert
pollit
the
honour
of
possessing
the
finest
beardsleys
still
in
this
country
he
read
greek
and
latin
authors
in
translations
and
often
astonished
scholars
by
his
acute
appreciation
of
their
matter
he
approached
dantesque
mediævalism
through
rossetti
and
later
on
at
the
original
source
much
of
his
early
work
illustrated
incidents
in
the
divine
comedy
he
was
a
fervent
admirer
of
the
romance
of
the
rose
in
the
original
and
several
mediæval
french
books
but
he
once
told
me
that
he
found
the
morte
very
illustration
the
dancer
reward
salome
for
one
so
romantic
in
the
expression
of
his
art
i
should
say
his
literary
and
artistic
tastes
were
severely
classic
though
you
would
have
expected
them
to
be
bizarre
he
was
ambitious
of
literary
success
but
any
aspirations
were
wisely
discouraged
by
his
admirers
his
writings
however
brilliant
and
they
often
were
brilliant
shewed
a
dangerous
cleverness
which
on
cultivation
might
have
proved
disastrous
to
the
realization
of
his
true
genius
under
the
hill
is
a
delightful
experiment
in
a
rococo
style
of
literature
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
praise
sufficiently
the
rhythm
and
metrical
adroitness
of
the
two
poems
in
the
savoy
magazine
though
i
can
not
speak
of
his
musical
attainments
it
may
be
regarded
as
fortunate
that
so
remarkable
a
genius
was
directed
to
a
more
permanent
form
of
executive
power
his
knowledge
of
life
art
and
literature
seemed
the
result
of
instinct
rather
than
study
for
no
one
has
ever
discovered
where
he
found
the
time
or
opportunity
for
assimilating
all
he
did
gregarious
and
sociable
by
nature
he
was
amusingly
secretive
about
his
methods
and
times
of
work
like
other
industrious
men
he
never
pretended
to
be
busy
or
pressed
for
time
he
never
denied
his
door
to
callers
nor
refused
to
go
anywhere
on
the
plea
of
work
he
disliked
anyone
being
in
the
room
when
he
was
drawing
and
hastily
hid
all
his
materials
if
a
stranger
entered
the
room
he
would
rarely
exhibit
an
unfinished
sketch
and
carefully
destroyed
any
he
was
not
thoroughly
satisfied
with
himself
he
carried
this
sensitive
spirit
of
selection
and
rather
far
calling
on
friends
who
possessed
primitives
he
would
destroy
these
early
relics
and
leave
a
more
mature
and
approved
specimen
of
his
art
or
the
de
of
some
book
he
had
illustrated
some
of
us
were
so
annoyed
that
we
were
eventually
obliged
to
lock
up
all
early
examples
for
though
friends
thus
victimized
were
endowed
with
a
more
valuable
acquisition
they
had
a
natural
sentiment
and
affection
for
the
unsophisticated
designs
of
his
earlier
years
illustration
tailpiece
salome
his
life
though
and
successful
was
outwardly
uneventful
in
the
early
summer
of
he
entered
professor
brown
night
school
at
westminster
but
during
the
day
continued
his
work
at
the
guardian
fire
insurance
until
august
when
by
his
sister
advice
he
resigned
his
post
in
december
he
acquainted
with
mr
pennell
from
whose
encouragement
and
advice
he
reaped
the
fullest
advantage
after
commencing
the
decorations
to
the
morte
he
ceased
to
attend
professor
brown
classes
in
february
some
of
his
drawings
were
first
published
in
london
in
the
pall
mall
budget
under
the
editorship
of
mr
lewis
hind
but
one
of
the
most
striking
of
his
early
designs
appeared
in
a
little
college
magazine
entitled
the
bee
when
the
studio
was
started
by
mr
charles
holme
under
the
able
direction
of
the
late
beardsley
designed
the
first
cover
and
mr
pennell
contributed
the
appreciation
of
the
new
artist
towards
the
end
of
he
commenced
working
for
mr
john
lane
who
issued
his
marvellous
illustrations
to
salomé
in
in
april
of
the
same
year
appeared
the
yellow
book
to
the
first
four
volumes
beardsley
contributed
altogether
about
eighteen
illustrations
from
a
pictorial
point
of
view
this
publication
had
no
other
than
as
a
vehicle
for
the
production
of
beardsley
work
though
henry
harland
in
his
capacity
as
literary
editor
revealed
the
presence
of
many
new
writers
among
us
throughout
beardsley
health
seemed
to
improve
and
his
social
success
was
considerable
in
the
previous
year
he
had
been
ridiculed
but
now
the
world
accepted
him
at
mr
valuation
the
beardsley
type
became
quite
a
fashion
and
was
burlesqued
at
many
of
the
theatres
his
name
and
work
were
on
everyone
lips
he
made
friends
with
many
of
his
contemporaries
distinguished
in
art
and
literature
at
the
house
of
one
of
his
friends
he
delivered
a
very
amusing
lecture
on
art
which
created
much
discussion
a
little
later
beardsley
was
popularly
supposed
to
have
given
pictorial
expression
to
the
views
and
sentiments
of
a
certain
school
and
his
drawings
were
regarded
as
the
outward
artistic
sign
of
inward
literary
corruption
this
is
not
the
place
to
discuss
the
invention
of
a
nest
he
suffered
considerably
by
this
premature
attempt
to
classify
his
art
further
efforts
to
ridicule
his
work
and
suppress
its
publication
were
however
among
the
most
cheering
failures
of
modern
journalism
in
he
ceased
to
contribute
to
the
yellow
book
and
in
january
the
savoy
was
started
by
leonard
smithers
with
mr
arthur
symons
as
the
literary
editor
who
became
the
most
subtle
and
discerning
of
all
his
critics
after
beardsley
death
failing
health
was
the
only
difficulty
with
which
he
had
to
contend
in
the
future
from
march
when
he
caught
a
severe
chill
at
brussels
he
became
a
permanent
invalid
he
returned
to
england
in
may
and
in
august
went
to
bournemouth
where
he
spent
the
autumn
and
winter
those
who
visited
him
at
bournemouth
never
expected
he
would
live
for
more
than
a
few
weeks
his
courage
however
never
failed
him
and
he
continued
work
even
while
suffering
from
lung
hæmorrhage
but
he
expressed
a
hope
and
belief
in
which
he
was
justified
that
he
might
be
spared
one
more
year
on
march
he
was
received
into
the
catholic
church
the
sincerity
of
his
religious
convictions
has
been
affirmed
by
those
who
were
with
him
constantly
and
as
i
have
suggested
before
the
flippancy
and
careless
nature
of
his
conversation
were
superficial
he
was
always
strict
in
his
religious
observances
among
his
intimate
friends
through
life
were
clergymen
and
priests
who
have
paid
tribute
to
the
reality
and
sincerity
of
his
belief
a
week
after
being
received
beardsley
rallied
again
and
moved
to
paris
but
still
required
the
attention
and
untiring
devotion
of
his
mother
to
whom
he
was
deeply
attached
he
never
returned
to
england
again
from
time
to
time
he
was
cheered
by
visits
from
miss
mabel
beardsley
mrs
bealby
wright
who
understood
her
brother
as
few
sisters
have
done
for
some
time
he
stayed
at
st
germain
and
in
july
he
went
to
dieppe
where
he
seemed
almost
to
have
recovered
it
was
only
however
for
a
short
time
and
in
the
end
of
he
was
hurried
to
mentone
he
never
left
his
room
after
january
the
accounts
of
him
which
reached
london
prepared
his
friends
for
the
end
almost
one
of
his
last
letters
was
to
mr
vincent
the
poet
congratulating
him
on
his
introduction
to
volpone
for
which
beardsley
was
making
the
illustrations
beardsley
had
a
considerable
knowledge
and
appreciation
of
ben
jonson

royal

as
thou
art
no
one
could
have
wished
him
to
live
on
in
pain
and
suffering
i
think
the
only
trials
of
his
life
were
the
periods
in
which
he
was
unfitted
for
work
his
remarkable
career
was
not
darkened
by
any
struggle
for
recognition
few
artists
have
been
so
fortunate
as
aubrey
beardsley
his
short
life
was
remarkably
happy
at
all
events
during
the
six
years
he
was
before
the
public
everything
he
did
met
with
success
a
success
thoroughly
enjoyed
by
him
he
seemed
indifferent
to
the
idle
criticism
and
violent
denunciation
with
which
much
of
his
art
was
hailed
i
never
heard
of
anyone
of
importance
who
disliked
him
personally
on
the
other
hand
many
who
were
hostile
and
prejudiced
about
his
art
ceased
to
attack
him
after
meeting
him
this
must
have
been
due
to
the
magnetism
and
charm
of
his
individuality
exercised
quite
unconsciously
for
he
never
tried
to
conciliate
people
or
to
work
the
oracle
but
rather
gloried
in
shocking
the
enemy
a
boyish
failing
for
which
he
may
be
forgiven
illustration
the
wagnerites
he
had
considerable
intellectual
vanity
but
it
never
relapsed
into
common
conceit
he
was
generous
in
recognizing
the
talent
and
genius
of
others
but
was
singularly
perverse
in
some
of
his
utterances
he
said
once
that
only
four
of
his
contemporaries
interested
him
he
bore
with
extraordinary
patience
the
assertions
of
foolish
persons
who
calmly
asserted
that
both
in
america
and
england
other
artists
had
anticipated
the
peculiarities
of
his
style
and
methods
i
have
seen
the
works
of
these
lambert
simnels
and
perkin
warbecks
and
they
proved
one
and
all
crows
in
peacocks
feathers
beardsley
style
nevertheless
influenced
unfortunately
i
think
many
excellent
artists
both
younger
and
older
than
himself
in
france
his
work
was
accepted
without
question
he
was
always
gratified
by
the
cordiality
which
greeted
him
in
a
country
where
he
was
more
generally
understood
than
in
his
own
he
has
illustrious
precedents
in
constable
and
bonnington
italy
austria
and
germany
recognized
in
him
a
master
some
time
before
his
death
at
berlin

picture
of
patrick

actress
is
now
in
a
place
of
honour

museum
a

study
of
himself
is
in
the
british
museum
print
room
a
few
examples
are
at
south

but
all
his
important
work
is
in
private
collections
much
of
it
is
in
america
and
germany
in
england
putting
aside
the
notoriety
and
sensation
caused
by
his
posters
and
the
yellow
book
appreciation
of
his
work
has
been
confined
rather
to
the
few
he
enjoyed
however
the
friendship
and
intimacy
of
great
numbers
of
people
shewing
that
his
amiable
qualities
no
less
than
his
art
received
due
recognition
his
conversation
was
vehement
and
witty
rather
than
humorous
he
had
a
remarkable
talent
for
mimicking
very
rarely
exercised
he
loved
argument
and
supported
theories
for
the
sake
of
argument
in
the
most
convincing
manner
leaving
strangers
with
a
totally
wrong
impression
about
himself
a
deception
to
which
he
was
much
addicted
he
possessed
what
is
called
an
artificial
manner
cultivated
to
an
extent
that
might
be
mistaken
for
affectation
he
never
could
sit
still
for
very
long
and
he
made
use
of
gesture
for
emphasis
his
peculiar
gait
has
been
very
happily
rendered
in
a
portrait
of
him
by
mr
walter
sickert
he
also
sat
to
blanche
the
french
portrait
painter
the
portrait
by
himself
is
tinged
with
caricature
to
estimate
the
art
of
aubrey
beardsley
is
not
difficult
that
his
drawings
must
excite
discussion
at
all
times
is
only
a
proof
of
their
lasting
worth
they
can
never
be
dismissed
with
unkindly
comment
nor
shelved
into
the
limbo
of
art
criticism
which
waits
for
many
blameless
and
depressing
productions
of
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
among
artists
and
men
of
letters
no
less
than
with
that
great
inartistic
body
the
public
aubrey
beardsley
name
will
always
call
forth
wonder
admiration
speculation
and
contempt
it
should
be
conceded
however
that
his
work
can
not
appeal
to
everyone
and
that
many
who
have
the
highest
perception
of
the
beautiful
see
only
the
repulsive
and
unwholesome
in
the
troubled
exotic
expression
of
his
genius
fortunately
no
reputation
in
art
or
letters
rests
on
the
verdict
of
majorities
it
is
the
opinion
of
the
few
which
finally
triumphs
artists
and
critics
have
already
dwelt
on
the
beauty
of
aubrey
beardsley
line
which
in
his
early
work
too
often
resolved
itself
into
mere
caligraphy
but
the
mature
and
perfect
illustrations
to
salomé
and
the
rape
of
the
lock
evince
a
mastery
unsurpassed
by
any
artist
in
any
age
or
country
no
one
ever
carried
a
simple
line
to
its
inevitable
end
with
such
sureness
and
firmness
of
purpose
and
this
is
one
of
the
lessons
which
even
an
accomplished
draughtsman
may
learn
from
his
drawings
in
any
age
when
scraggy
execution
masquerades
under
impressionism
aubrey
beardsley
did
not
shirk
a
difficulty
by
leaving
lines
to
the
imagination
of
critics
who
might
enlarge
on
the
reticence
of
his
medium
art
cant
and
studio
jargon
do
not
explain
his
work
it
is
really
only
the
presence
or
absence
of
beauty
in
his
drawing
and
his
wonderful
powers
of
technique
which
need
trouble
his
admirers
or
detractors
nor
are
we
confronted
with
any
conjecture
as
to
what
aubrey
beardsley
might
have
done
he
has
left
a
series
of
achievements
while
his
early
death
caused
deep
sorrow
among
his
personal
friends
there
need
be
no
sorrow
for
an
inheritor
of
unfulfilled
renown
old
age
is
no
more
a
necessary
complement
to
the
realization
of
genius
than
premature
death
within
six
years
after
passing
through
all
the
imitative
stages
of
probation
he
produced
masterpieces
he
might
have
repeated
but
never
surpassed
his
style
would
have
changed
he
was
too
receptive
and
too
restless
to
acquiesce
in
a
single
convention
illustration
atalanta
this
is
hardly
the
place
to
dwell
on
the
great
strides
which
black
and
white
art
made
in
the
nineteenth
century
it
has
been
called
the
most
modern
of
the
arts
for
the
most
finished
drawings
of
the
old
masters
were
done
with
a
view
to
serve
as
studies
or
designs
to
be
transferred
to
canvas
metal
and
wood
not
for
frames
at
an
expensive
dealer
vittore
pisano
and
gentile
bellini
would
hardly
have
dared
to
mount
their
delightful
studies
and
offer
them
as
pictures
to
the
critics
and
patrons
of
their
day
at
all
events
it
were
safer
to
say
that
appreciation
of
a
drawing
for
itself
without
relation
to
the
book
or
page
it
was
intended
to
adorn
or
destroy
is
comparatively
modern
it
is
necessary
to
keep
this
in
mind
because
the
suitability
of
work
to
the
books
he
embellished
was
often
accidental
his
designs
must
be
judged
independently
as
they
were
conceived
without
any
view
of
interpreting
or
even
illustrating
a
particular
author
he
was
too
subjective
to
be
a
mere
illustrator
profoundly
interested
in
literature
for
the
purposes
of
his
art
he
only
extracted
from
it
whatever
was
suggestive
as
pattern
he
never
professed
to
interpret
for
dull
people
unable
to
understand
what
they
read
any
more
than
the
mediæval
illuminator
and
carver
of
grotesques
attempted
to
explain
the
mysteries
of
the
christian
faith
on
the
borders
of
missals
and
breviaries
or
the
miserere
seats
of
the
choir
his
art
was
of
course
intensely
to
use
the
word
hated
of
modern
critics
but
his
expression
of
it
was
the
legitimate
literature
of
the
artist
not
the
art
peculiar
to
literature
he
did
not
attempt
or
certainly
never
succeeded
in
giving
pictorial
revision
to
a
work
of
literature
in
the
sense
that
blake
has
done
for
the
book
of
job
and
botticelli
for
the
divine
comedy
while
hardly
satisfying
those
for
whom
any
work
of
art
guilty
of
subject
becomes
worthless
this
immunity
from
the
conventions
of
the
illustrator
will
secure
for
beardsley
a
larger
share
of
esteem
among
artists
pure
and
simple
than
has
ever
fallen
to
william
blake
who
appeals
more
to
men
of
letters
than
to
the
artist
or
virtuoso
the
uncritical
profess
to
find
many
terrible
meanings
in
aubrey
drawings
and
he
will
probably
never
be
freed
from
the
charge
of
symbolism
however
morbid
the
sentiment
in
some
of
his
work
and
often
there
was
a
an
unholy
insistence
on
the
less
beautiful
side
of
human
things
the
cabala
of
the
symbolists
was
a
sealed
book
to
him
such
things
were
entirely
foreign
to
his
lucid
and
vigorous
intelligence
there
is
hardly
a
drawing
of
his
that
does
not
explain
itself
the
commentator
will
search
in
vain
for
any
hieroglyphic
or
symbolic
intention
the
hieratic
archaism
of
his
early
work
misled
many
people
for
whom
means
presupposition
of
mysticism
that
he
had
none
at
all
initiation
of
a
neophyte
into
the
black
would
seem
to
contradict
such
a
statement
the
fantasy
and
grotesqueness
of
that
lurid
and
haunting
composition
have
nothing
in
common
with
the
symbolism
of
black
magic
the
ritual
of
freemasonry
or
all
the
fascinating
magic
to
be
found
in
the
works
of
eliphaz
levi
the
sumptuous
accessories
in
which
he
revelled
had
no
other
than
a
decorative
intention
giving
sometimes
balance
to
a
drawing
or
conveying
a
literary
suggestion
necessary
for
its
interpretation
artists
are
blamed
for
what
they
have
not
tried
to
do
or
for
the
absence
of
qualities
distinguishing
the
work
of
an
entirely
different
order
of
intellect
for
their
indifference
to
the
observations
of
as
who
should
ask
from
reynolds
a
faithful
reproduction
of
textile
fabrics
and
from
carlo
crivelli
the
natural
phenomena
of
nature
we
expect
from
turner
and
constable
for
nature
as
it
should
be
in
the
works
of
corot
and
turner
for
nature
made
easy
in
modern
english
landscape
for
nature
without
tears
in
the
impressionist
fashion
or
as
popularly
viewed
through
the
camera
aubrey
beardsley
had
no
feeling
he
was
frankly
indifferent
to
picturesque
peasants
the
beauties
of
lovely
spots
either
in
england
or
france
a
devout
catholic
the
ringing
of
the
angelus
did
not
lure
him
to
present
fields
of
in
an
evening
haze
the
treatment
of
nature
in
the
larger
and
truer
sense
of
the
word
had
little
attraction
for
him
he
never
tried
therefore
to
represent
air
atmosphere
and
light
as
many
clever
modern
artists
have
done
in
black
and
white
though
claude
that
master
of
light
and
shadow
was
a
landscape
painter
who
really
interested
him
landscape
therefore
is
formal
primitive
conventional
a
breath
of
air
hardly
shakes
the
delicate
leaves
of
the
straight
poplars
and
willows
that
grow
by
his
serpentine
streams
the
great
cliffs
leaning
down
in
promontories
to
the
sea
have
that
unreal
architectural
appearance
so
remarkable
in
the
west
of
cornwall
a
place
he
had
never
visited
yet
his
love
and
observation
of
flowers
trees
and
gardens
are
very
striking
in
the
drawings
for
the
morte
and
the
savoy
magazine
but
it
is
the
nature
of
the
landscape
gardener
not
the
landscape
painter
there
is
some
truth
in
the
criticism
that
his
pictures
were
a
form
of
romantic
future
experts
however
may
be
trusted
to
deal
with
absence
of
chiaroscuro
values
tones
and
the
rest
in
only
one
of
his
drawings
conceived
curiously
enough
in
the
manner
of
an
unlikely
model
is
there
anything
approaching
what
is
usually
termed
atmosphere
eliminating
therefore
all
that
must
not
be
expected
from
his
art
mere
illustration
realism
symbolism
and
naturalism
in
what
may
be
asked
does
his
supreme
achievement
consist
he
has
decorated
white
sheets
of
paper
as
they
have
never
been
decorated
before
whether
hung
on
the
wall
reproduced
in
a
book
or
concealed
in
a
museum
they
remain
among
the
most
precious
and
exquisite
works
in
the
art
of
the
nineteenth
century
resembling
the
designs
of
william
blake
only
in
that
they
must
be
hated
misunderstood
and
neglected
ere
they
are
recognized
as
works
of
a
master
with
more
simple
materials
than
those
employed
by
the
fathers
of
black
and
white
art
beardsley
has
left
memorials
no
less
wonderful
than
those
of
the
greek
so
highly
prized
by
artists
and

but
no
less
difficult

the
uninitiated
to
appreciate
and
understand
illustration
the
mysterious
rose
garden
the
astonishing
fertility
of
his
invention
and
the
amount
of
work
he
managed
to
produce
were
inconceivable
yet
there
is
never
any
sign
of
hurry
there
is
no
scamping
in
his
deft
and
tidy
drawing
the
neatness
of
his
most
elaborate
designs
would
suggest
many
sketches
worked
over
and
discarded
before
deciding
on
the
final
form
and
composition
strange
to
say
this
was
not
his
method
he
sketched
everything
in
pencil
at
first
covering
the
paper
with
apparent
scrawls
constantly
rubbed
out
and
blocked
in
again
until
the
whole
surface
became
raddled
from
pencil
indiarubber
and
knife
over
this
incoherent
surface
he
worked
in
chinese
ink
with
a
gold
pen
often
ignoring
the
pencil
lines
afterwards
carefully
removed
so
every
drawing
was
invented
built
up
and
completed
on
the
same
sheet
of
paper
and
the
same
process
was
repeated
even
when
he
produced
replicas
at
first
he
was
indifferent
to
process
reproduction
but
owing
to
mr
pennell
influence
he
later
on
always
worked
with
that
end
in
view
thereby
losing
some
will
think
his
independence
but
he
had
nothing
to
complain
of
mr
contention
about
process
was
never
so
well
proved
as
in
case
his
experiments
in
colour
were
not
always
successful
two
of
his
most
delightful
designs
he
ruined
by
tinting
in
the
posters
and
studio
lithograph
however
the
crude
colour
is
highly
effective
and
de
shewed
he
might
have
mastered
had
he
chosen
to
do
so
there
are
at
present
in
the
market
many
coloured
forgeries
of
his
work
these
have
been
contrived
by
tracing
or
copying
the
reproductions
the
colour
is
often
used
to
conceal
the
paucity
of
the
drawing
and
hesitancy
of
line
they
are
nearly
always
versions
of
designs
and
profess
to
be
replicas
when
there
any
doubt
the
history
and
provenance
of
the
work
should
be
carefully
studied
it
is
not
difficult
to
trace
the
pedigree
of
any
example
illustration

a
nocturne
of
chopin
a
good
deal
has
been
made
out
of
beardsley
love
of
dark
rooms
and
lamp
light
but
this
has
been
grossly
exaggerated
he
had
no
great
faith
in
north
lights
and
studio
paraphernalia
so
necessary
for
those
who
use
mediums
other
than
his
own

sometimes

flat

which
would
fall
directly
on
the
paper
the
blind
slightly
lowered
the
sources
of
beardsley
inspiration
have
led
critics
into
grievous
errors
he
was
accused
of
imitating
artists
some
of
whose
work
he
had
never
seen
and
of
whose
names
he
was
ignorant
at
the
time
the
alleged
plagiarism
was
perpetrated
félicien
rops
may
be
mentioned
as
an
instance
beardsley
contrived
a
style
long
before
he
came
across
any
modern
french
illustration
he
was
innocent
of
either
salon
the
rosicrucians
and
the
royal
academy
alike
but
his
own
influence
on
the
continent
is
said
to
be
considerable
that
he
borrowed
freely
and
from
every
imaginable
master
old
and
new
is
of
course
obvious
eclectic
is
certainly
applicable
to
him
but
what
he
took
he
endowed
with
a
fantastic
and
fascinating
originality
to
some
image
or
accessory
familiar
to
anyone
who
has
studied
the
old
masters
he
added
the
touch
of
modernity
which
brings
them
nearer
to
us
and
reached
refinements
never
thought
of
by
the
old
masters
imagination
is
the
great
pirate
of
art
and
with
beardsley
becomes
a
pretext
for
invention
prior
to
his
drawings
are
interesting
only
for
their
precocity
they
may
be
regarded
as
one
of
his
friends
has
said
more
as
a
presage
than
a
precedent
you
marvel
on
realizing
the
short
interval
which
elapsed
between
their
production
and
the
masterpieces
of
his
maturity
his
first
enthusiasm
was
for
the
work
of
the
italian
primitives
as
mr
charles
whibley
says
distinguished
for
its
free
and
flowing
line
even
at
a
later
time
when
he
devoted
himself
to
eighteenth
century
models
and
ideals
his
love
of
andrea
mantegna
never
deserted
him
he
always
kept
reproductions
from
mantegna
at
his
side
and
declared
that
he
never
ceased
to
learn
secrets
from
them
in
the
of
mary
and
the
two
versions
of
of
this
influence
is
very
marked
a
botticelli
phase
followed
and
though
afterwards
discarded
was
reverted
to
at
a
later
period
the
british
museum
and
the
national
gallery
were
at
first
his
only
schools
of
art
as
a
matter
of
course
rossetti
and
but
chiefly
through
photographs
and
prints
succeeded
in
their
turn
the
influence
of
lasting
longer
than
any
other
fairly
drugged
with
too
much
observation
of
old
and
modern
masters
he
entered
professor
brown
art
school
where
he
successfully
got
rid
of
much
that
was
superfluous
the
three
months
training
had
the
most
salutary
effect
he
now
took
the
advice
attributed
to
and
unlearned
much
of
his
acquired
pedantry
the
mere
penmanship
which
disfigured
some
of
his
early
work
entirely
disappeared
his
handling
became
finer
his
drawing
less
timid
the
sketch
of
it
may
be
interesting
to
note
belongs
to
this
period
of
his
art
illustration
chopin

op
by
permission
of
charles
holme
a
few
months
afterwards
he
commenced
the
morte
suggested
and
intended
to
rival
the
volumes
of
the
kelmscott
press
it
is
his
most
popular
and
least
satisfactory
performance
still
the
borders
have
far
more
variety
and
invention
than
those
of
morris
the
intricate
splendours
of
mediæval
manuscripts
are
intelligently
imitated
or
adapted
the
and
are
delightful
in
themselves
and
among
the
most
exquisite
of
his
grotesques
and
embellishments
but
the
popularity
of
the
book
was
due
to
its
lack
of
originality
not
to
its
individuality
mediævalism
for
the
middle
classes
always
ensures
an
appreciative
audience
oddly
enough
morris
was
said
to
be
annoyed
by
the
sincerest
form
of
flattery
perhaps
he
felt
that
every
school
of
art
comes
to
an
end
with
the
birth
of
the
founder
and
that
beardsley
was
only
exercising
himself
in
an
alien
field
of
which
morris
himself
owned
the
tithe
at
all
events
it
is
not
unlikely
that
beardsley
aroused
in
the
great
poet
and
decorator
the
same
suspicion
that
he
had
undoubtedly
done
in
watts
the
morte
may
be
said
for
convenience
to
close
aubrey
beardsley
first
period
but
he
modified
his
style
during
the
progress
of
the
publication
and
there
is
no
unity
of
intention
in
his
types
or
scheme
of
decoration
he
was
gravitating
japanwards
he
began
however
his
japanesques
long
before
seeing
any
real
japanese
art
except
what
may
be
found
in
the
london
shop
windows
on
cheap
trays
or
he
never
thought
seriously
of
borrowing
from
this
source
until
some
one
not
conversant
with
oriental
art
insisted
on
the
resemblance
of
his
drawings
to
kakemonos
it
was
quite
accidental
beardsley
was
really
studying
with
great
care
and
attention
the
crivellis
in
the
national
gallery
their
superficial
resemblance
to
japanese
work
occasioned
an
error
from
which
beardsley
quick
to
assimilate
ideas
and
modes
of
expression
took
a
suggestion
unconsciously
and
ignorantly
offered
and
studied
genuine
examples
first
version
was
produced
prior
to
this
incident
and
cigale
birthday
immediately
afterwards
his
emulation
of
the
japanese
never
left
him
until
the
production
of
the
savoy
magazine
in
my
view
this
was
the
only
bad
artistic
influence
which
ever
threatened
to
endanger
his
originality
or
permanently
vitiate
his
manner
the
free
use
of
chinese
ink
together
with
his
intellectual
vitality
saved
him
from
succumbing
to
japan
to
use
mr
pennell
excellent
phrase

the
baron
prayer
the
rape
of
the
lock
a
series
of
grotesques
to
decorate
some
rather
silly
anthologies
produced
in
the
same
year
as
the
morte
are
marvels
of
ingenuity
and
far
more
characteristic
with
them
he
began
a
new
period
throwing
over
the
deliberate
archaism
and
mediævalism
of
which
he
began
to
tire
in
the
illustrations
to
salomé
he
reached
the
consummation
of
the
new
convention
he
created
for
himself
they
are
collectively
his
masterpiece
in
the
whole
range
of
art
there
is
nothing
like
them
you
can
trace
the
origin
of
their
development
but
you
can
not
find
anything
wherewith
to
compare
them
they
are
absolutely
unique
before
commencing
salomé
two
events
contributed
to
give
beardsley
a
fresh
impetus
and
stimulate
his
method
of
expression
a
series
of
visits
to
the
collection
of
greek
vases
in
the
british
museum
prompted
by
an
essay
of
mr
mccoll
and
to
the
famous
peacock
room
of
mr
whistler
in
prince
gate
one
the
antithesis
of
japan
the
other
of
impressionable
at
all
times
to
novel
sensations
his
artistic
perceptions
vibrated
with
a
new
and
inspired
enthusiasm
critical
appreciation
under
his
pen
meant
creation
from
the
greek
vase
painting
he
learned
that
drapery
can
be
represented
effectually
with
a
few
lines
disposed
with
economy
not
by
a
number
of
unfinished
scratches
and
superfluous
shading
if
the
salomé
drawings
have
any
fault
at
all
it
is
that
the
texture
of
the
pictures
suggests
some
other
medium
than
pen
and
ink
as
mr
walter
crane
has
pointed
out
in
his
other
work
they
are
wrought
rather
than
drawn
and
might
be
designs
for
the
panel
of
a
cabinet
for
limoges
or
oriental
enamel
the
rape
of
the
lock
is
therefore
a
more
obvious
example
of
black
and
white
art
beardsley
second
period
lasted
until
the
fourth
volume
of
the
yellow
book
in
which
the
should
be
mentioned
as
one
of
the
finest
in
beardsley
many
people
think
to
the
detriment
of
his
style
turned
his
attention
to
the
eighteenth
century
in
the
literature
of
which
he
was
always
deeply
interested
eisen
moreau
watteau
cochin
pietro
longhi
now
became
his
masters
the
alien
romantic
art
of
wagner
often
supplied
the
theme
and
subject
the
level
of
excellence
sustained
throughout
the
savoy
magazine
is
extraordinary
in
view
of
the
terrible
state
of
his
health
his
unexampled
precision
of
line
hardly
ever
falters
and
while
his
composition
gains
in
simplicity
his
capacity
for
detail
has
not
flagged
it
is
perhaps
an
accident
that
in
his
most
pathetic
drawing
death
of
his
hand
seems
momentarily
to
have
lost
its
cunning
the
same
year
he
gave
us
the
rape
of
the
lock
regarded
by
some
artists
as
the
testament
of
his
genius
and
an
even
more
astonishing
set
of
drawings
to
the
lysistrata
of
aristophanes
these
are
grander
than
the
rape
of
the
lock
and
larger
in
treatment
than
anything
he
ever
attempted
privately
issued
beardsley
was
able
to
give
full
rein
to
a
rabelaisian
fantasy
which
he
sometimes
cultivated
with
too
great
persistence
irritated
by
what
he
considered
as
in
some
of
his
critics
he
seemed
determined
to
frighten
his
public
there
is
nothing
unwholesome
or
suggestive
about
the
lysistrata
designs
they
are
as
as
frank
free
and
outspoken
as
the
text
for
the
countrymen
of
chaucer
to
simulate
indignation
about
them
can
only
be
explained
because
things
seen
are
greater
than
things
heard
yet
when
an
artist
frankly
deals
with
forbidden
subjects
the
old
canons
regular
of
english
art
begin
to
thunder
the
critics
forget
their
french
accent
the
old
robert
adam
which
is
in
all
of
us
asserts
himself
we
fly
for
the
a
real
artist
beardsley
has
not
burdened
himself
with
chronology
or
archæology
conceived
somewhat
in
the
spirit
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
period
of
graceful
indecency
there
is
here
however
an
olympian
air
a
statuesque
beauty
only
comparable
to
the
antique
vases
the
illusion
is
enhanced
by
the
absence
of
all
background
and
this
gives
an
added
touch
of
severity
to
the
compositions
throughout
the
general
tendency
his
style
remains
uniform
though
without
sameness
he
adapted
his
technique
to
the
requirements
of
his
subject
mindful
of
the
essential
rejecting
the
needless
he
always
realized
his
genius
and
its
limitations
from
the
infinite
variety
of
the
savoy
magazine
it
is
difficult
to
choose
any
of
particular
importance
for
his
elaborate
manner
the
first
plate
to
the
and
in
a
simpler
style
the
fascinating
illustration
to
his
own
poem
atque
and
death
of
have
besides
a
human
interest
over
and
above
any
artistic
quality
they
possess
for
the
volpone
drawings
beardsley
again
developed
his
style
and
seeking
for
new
effects
reverted
to
pure
pencil
work
the
ornate
delicate
initial
letters
all
he
lived
to
finish
must
be
seen
in
the
originals
before
their
sumptuous
qualities
their
solemn
melancholy
dignity
their
dexterous
handling
can
be
appreciated
the
use
of
a
brush
for
the
illustrations
to
de
one
of
his
last
works
should
be
noted
as
he
so
rarely
used
one
beardsley
invention
never
failed
him
so
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
take
a
single
drawing
or
set
of
drawings
as
typical
of
his
art
each
design
is
rather
a
type
of
his
own
intellectual
mood
illustration
the
battle
of
beaux
and
belles
the
rape
of
the
lock
if
the
history
of
grotesque
remains
to
be
written
it
is
already
illustrated
by
his
art
a
subject
little
understood
it
belongs
to
the
dim
ways
of
criticism
there
is
no
canon
or
school
and
the
artist
is
allowed
to
be
wilful
untrammelled
by
rule
or
precedent
true
grotesque
is
not
the
art
either
of
primitives
or
decadents
but
that
of
skilled
and
accomplished
workmen
who
have
reached
the
zenith
of
a
peculiar
convention
however
confined
and
limited
that
convention
may
be
byzantine
art
one
of
our
links
with
the
east
should
some
day
furnish
us
with
a
key
to
a
mystery
which
is
now
obscured
by
symbolists
and
students
of
serpent
worship
the
greeks
with
their
supreme
sanity
and
unrivalled
plastic
sense
afford
us
no
real
examples
though
their
archaic
art
is
often
pressed
into
the
category
beardsley
who
received
recognition
for
this
side
of
his
genius
emphasized
the
grotesque
to
an
extent
that
precluded
any
popularity
among
people
who
care
only
for
the
trivial
and
pretty
in
him
it
was
allied
to
a
mordant
humour
a
certain
fescennine
abstraction
which
sometimes
offends
this
however
does
not
excuse
the
use
of
the
word
eccentric
more
misapplied
than
any
word
in
the
english
language
except
perhaps
grotesque
and
picturesque
all
great
art
is
eccentric
to
the
conservative
multitude
the
decoration
on
the
parthenon
was
so
eccentric
that
pheidias
was
put
in
prison
the
works
of
whistler
and
once
derided
as
eccentric
are
now
accepted
as
the
commencement
of
great
traditions
all
future
art
will
be
dubbed
eccentric
trampled
on
and
despised
even
as
the
first
tulip
that
blossomed
in
england
was
rooted
out
and
burnt
for
a
worthless
weed
by
the
conscientious
scotch
gardener
illustration
a
design
from
lysistrata
to
compare
beardsley
with
any
of
his
contemporaries
would
be
unjust
to
them
and
to
him
he
belonged
to
no
school
and
can
leave
no
legend
in
the
sense
that
rossetti
whistler
and
professor
legros
have
done
he
proclaimed
no
theory
he
left
no
counsel
of
perfection
to
those
who
came
after
him
in
england
and
america
a
horde
of
depressing
disciples
aped
his
manner
with
a
singular
want
of
success
while
admirable
and
painstaking
artists
modified
their
own
convictions
in
the
cause
of
unpopularity
with
fatal
results
the
sensuous
charm
of
imagination
and
his
mode
of
expression
have
only
a
superficial
resemblance
to
the
foreign
masters
of
black
and
white
he
continued
no
great
tradition
of
the
has
nothing
in
common
with
the
inventive
and
various
genius
of
mr
charles
ricketts
nothing
of
the
pictorial
propriety
that
distinguishes
the
work
of
his
friend
mr
pennell
or
the
homogeneous
congruity
of
boyd
houghton
charles
keene
and
mr
frederic
sandys
he
made
use
of
different
styles
where
other
men
employed
different
mediums
unperplexed
by
painting
or
etching
or
lithography
he
was
satisfied
with
the
simplest
of
all
materials
attaining
therewith
unapproachable
executive
power
those
who
cavil
at
his
flawless
technique
ignore
the
specific
quality
of
drawing
characterising
every
great
artist
the
grammar
of
art
exists
only
to
be
violated
its
rules
can
be
learnt
by
anyone
those
who
have
no
artistic
perception
invariably
find
fault
with
the
perspective
just
as
those
who
can
not
write
a
sentence
are
always
swift
to
detect
faults
in

there
are
of
course
weaknesses
in
the
extremities
of
beardsley
figures
the
hands
and
feet
being
interruptions
rather
than
continuations
of
the
limbs
occasional
carelessness
in
this
respect
is
certainly
noticeable
and
the
structure
of
his
figures
is
throughout
capricious
it
was
no
fault
in
his
early
work
the
hands
and
feet
in
the
of
if
crude
and
exaggerated
being
carefully
modelled
while
the
right
hand
of
salomé
in
dancer
grasping
the
head
of
the
baptist
is
perfectly
drawn
the
left
is
feeble

drawing
nothing
can
equal
the
nude
figure

colophon
to
salomé
the
outstretched
quivering
hands

are
intentionally
rendered
larger
than
proportion
allows
to
render
dramatic
expression
not
reality
for
the
purpose

he
adapted
proportions
realizing
that
perfect
congruity
and
reality
are
irreconcilable

is
no
need
to
disturb
ourselves
with
hopes
and
fears
for
the
estimation
with
which
posterity
will
cherish
his
memory
art
history
can
not
afford
to
overlook

it
could

a
mere
comment
on
the
admirations
of
the
last

is
invaluable
he
sums
up
all
the
delightful

is

modern
appreciation

the
masters

the
english
there
are
differences
of
kind
in
æsthetic
beauty
and
for
beardsley
it
was
the
marriage
of
arabesque
to
figures
and
objects
comely
or
fantastic
or
in
themselves
ugly
for
hitherto
the
true
arabesque
abhorred
the
graven
image
made
of
artists
hands
to
future
draughtsmen
he
will
have
something
of
the
value
of
an
old
master
studied
for
that
fastidious
technique
which
critics
believed
to
be
a
trick
and
collectors
of
his
work
may
live
to
be
rallied
for
their
taste
but
the
wheat
and
the
chaff
contrive
to
exist
together
through
the
centuries
a
passing
reference
should
be
made
to
the
beardsley
of
popular
delusion
a
student
of
callot
and
hogarth
he
took
suggestions
from
the
age
in
which
he
lived
and
from
the
literature
of
english
and
french
contemporaries
but
with
no
implicit
acceptance
of
the
tenets
of
any
groups
or
schools
which
flutter
the
of
fleet
street
he
stood
apart
independent
of
the
shibboleths
of
art
and
literature
with
the
grim
and
sometimes
mocking
attention
of
a
spectator
he
revealed
rather
than
created
a
feminine
type
offering
no
solution
for
the
problems
of
providence

mademoiselle
de
maupin
reproduced
from
the
original
in
the
possession
of
bealby
applying
the
epithet
original
to
an
art
so
intensely
reminiscent
so
ingeniously
retrospective
might
seem
paradoxical
to
those
unacquainted
with
beardsley
more
elegant
achievements
his
is
not
the
originality
of
corot
and
whistler
with
a
new
interpretation
of
nature
another
scheme
of
art
and
decoration
but
rather
the
scholarly
originality
of
the
carracci
a
scholarship
grounded
on
a
thousand
traditions
and
yet
striking
an
entirely
new
note
in
art
in
his
imagination
his
choice
of
motive
his
love
for
inanimate
nature
his
sentiment
for
accessory
rejected
by
many
modern
artists
still
so
necessary
to
the
modern
temper
his
curious
type
which
quite
overshadowed
that
of
the
the
singular
technical
qualities
at
his
command
beardsley
has
no
predecessors
no
rivals
who
has
ever
managed
to
suggest
such
colour
in
masses
of
black
deftly
composed
reference
to
the
text
is
unnecessary
to
learn
that
the
hair
of
herodias
was
purple
his
style
was
mobile
dominating
over
or
subordinate
to
the
subject
as
his
genius
dictated
he
twisted
human
forms
some
will
think
into
fantastic
peculiar
shapes
becoming
more
than
romantic
antinomian
he
does
not
appeal
to
experience
but
to
expression
the
tranquil
trivialities
of
what
is
usually
understood
by
the
illustration
of
books
had
no
meaning
for
him
and
before
any
attempt
is
made
to
discriminate
and
interpret
the
spirit
the
poetical
sequence
the
literary
inspiration
which
undoubtedly
existed
throughout
his
work
side
by
side
with
technical
experiments
his
exemption
from
the
parallels
of
criticism

be
remembered
