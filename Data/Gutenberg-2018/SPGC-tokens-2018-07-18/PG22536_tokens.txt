since
when
austen
leigh
published
his
of
jane
considerable
additions
have
been
made
to
the
stock
of
information
available
for
her
biographers
of
these
fresh
sources
of
knowledge
the
set
of
letters
from
jane
to
cassandra
edited
by
lord
brabourne
has
been
by
far
the
most
important
these
letters
are
invaluable
as
pour
although
they
cover
only
the
comparatively
rare
periods
when
the
two
sisters
were
separated
and
although
cassandra
purposely
destroyed
many
of
the
letters
likely
to
prove
the
most
interesting
from
a
distaste
for
publicity
some
further
correspondence
and
many
incidents
in
the
careers
of
two
of
her
brothers
may
be
read
in
austen
sailor
by
hubback
and
edith
hubback
while
miss
constance
hill
has
been
able
to
add
several
family
traditions
to
the
interesting
topographical
information
embodied
in
her
austen
her
homes
and
her
nor
ought
we
to
forget
the
careful
research
shown
in
other
biographies
of
the
author
especially
that
by
oscar
fay
adams
during
the
last
few
years
we
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
be
able
to
add
to
this
store
and
every
existing
or
tradition
preserved
by
the
family
of
which
we
have
any
knowledge
has
been
placed
at
our
disposal
it
seemed
therefore
to
us
that
the
time
had
come
when
a
more
complete
chronological
account
of
the
novelist
life
might
be
laid
before
the
public
whose
interest
in
jane
austen
as
we
readily
acknowledge
has
shown
no
signs
of
diminishing
either
in
england
or
in
america
the
must
always
remain
the
one
firsthand
account
of
her
resting
on
the
authority
of
a
nephew
who
knew
her
intimately
and
that
of
his
two
sisters
we
could
not
compete
with
its
vivid
personal
recollections
and
the
last
thing
we
should
wish
to
do
even
were
it
possible
would
be
to
supersede
it
we
believe
however
that
it
needs
to
be
supplemented
not
only
because
so
much
additional
material
has
been
brought
to
light
since
its
publication
but
also
because
the
account
given
of
their
aunt
by
her
nephew
and
nieces
could
be
given
only
from
their
own
point
of
view
while
the
incidents
and
characters
fall
into
a
somewhat
different
perspective
if
the
whole
is
seen
from
a
greater
distance
their
knowledge
of
their
aunt
was
during
the
last
portion
of
her
life
and
they
knew
her
best
of
all
in
her
last
year
when
her
health
was
failing
and
she
was
living
in
much
seclusion
and
they
were
not
likely
to
be
the
recipients
of
her
inmost
confidences
on
the
events
and
sentiments
of
her
youth
hence
the
emotional
and
romantic
side
of
her
nature
a
very
real
one
has
not
been
dwelt
upon
no
doubt
the
austens
were
as
a
family
unwilling
to
show
their
deeper
feelings
and
the
sad
end
of
jane
one
romance
would
naturally
tend
to
intensify
this
dislike
of
expression
but
the
feeling
was
there
and
it
finally
found
utterance
in
her
latest
work
when
through
anne
elliot
she
claimed
for
women
the
right
of
longest
when
existence
or
when
hope
is
gone
then
again
her
nephew
and
nieces
hardly
knew
how
much
she
had
gone
into
society
or
how
much
with
a
certain
characteristic
aloofness
she
had
enjoyed
it
bath
either
when
she
was
the
guest
of
her
uncle
and
aunt
or
when
she
was
a
resident
london
with
her
brother
henry
and
his
wife
and
the
rather
miscellaneous
society
which
they
enjoyed
godmersham
with
her
brother
edward
and
his
county
neighbours
in
east
kent
these
had
all
given
her
many
opportunities
of
studying
the
particular
types
which
she
blended
into
her
own
creations
a
third
point
is
the
uneventful
nature
of
the
author
life
which
as
we
think
has
been
a
good
deal
exaggerated
quiet
it
certainly
was
but
the
quiet
life
of
a
member
of
a
large
family
in
the
england
of
that
date
was
compatible
with
a
good
deal
of
stirring
incident
happening
if
not
to
herself
at
all
events
to
those
who
were
nearest
to
her
and
who
commanded
her
deepest
sympathies
we
hope
therefore
that
our
narrative
with
all
its
imperfections
and
its
inevitable
repetition
of
much
that
has
already
been
published
will
at
least
be
of
use
in
removing
misconceptions
in
laying
some
new
facts
before
the
reader
and
in
placing
others
in
a
fresh
light
it
is
intended
as
a
narrative
and
not
as
a
piece
of
literary
criticism
for
we
should
not
care
to
embark
upon
the
latter
in
competition
with
biographers
and
essayists
who
have
a
better
claim
to
be
heard
both
in
the
plan
and
in
the
execution
of
our
work
we
have
received
much
valuable
help
from
another
member
of
the
family
mary
austen
leigh
an
arrangement
courteously
made
by
the
owners
of
the
copyright
has
procured
for
us
a
free
and
ample
use
of
the
letters
as
edited
by
lord
brabourne
while
the
kindness
of
nicholson
of
castlefield
house
lincolnshire
has
opened
a
completely
new
source
of
information
in
the
letters
which
passed
between
the
austens
and
their
kinsmen
of
the
walters
of
kent
and
afterwards
of
lincolnshire
miss
jane
austen
granddaughter
of
admiral
charles
austen
and
miss
margaret
bellas
of
james
austen
are
so
good
as
to
allow
us
to
make
a
fuller
use
of
their
family
documents
than
was
found
possible
by
the
author
of
the
while
hubback
permits
us
to
draw
freely
upon
the
and
captain
austen
upon
his
mss
finally
we
owe
to
admiral
ernest
rice
kind
permission
to
have
the
photograph
taken
from
which
the
reproduction
of
his
zoffany
portrait
is
made
into
a
frontispiece
for
this
volume
we
hope
that
any

who

chapter
i
austens
and
leighs
at
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
there
was
living
at
horsmonden
a
small
village
in
the
weald
of
kent
a
certain
john
austen
from
his
will
it
is
evident
that
he
was
a
man
of
considerable
means
owning
property
in
kent
and
sussex
and
elsewhere
he
also
held
a
lease
of
certain
lands
from
sir
henry
whetenhall
including
in
all
probability
the
manor
house
of
broadford
in
horsmonden
what
wealth
he
had
was
doubtless
derived
from
the
clothing
trade
for
hasted
instances
the
austens
together
with
the
bathursts
courthopes
and
others
as
some
of
the
ancient
families
of
that
part
of
large
estate
and
genteel
rank
in
life
but
sprung
from
ancestors
who
had
used
the
great
staple
manufacture
of
clothing
he
adds
that
these
clothiers
usually
called
the
gray
coats
of
kent
and
were
a
body
so
numerous
that
at
county
elections
whoever
had
their
vote
and
interest
was
almost
certain
of
being
elected
john
austen
died
in
leaving
a
large
family
of
these
the
fifth
son
francis
who
died
in
describes
himself
in
his
will
as
a
clothier
of
grovehurst
this
place
being
like
broadford
a
pretty
timbered
house
of
moderate
size
near
the
picturesque
old
village
of
horsmonden
both
houses
still
belong
to
the
austen
family
francis
left
a
son
john
whose
son
was
another
john
this
last
john
settled
at
broadford
while
his
father
remained
at
grovehurst
and
when
quite
young
married
elizabeth
weller
he
seems
to
have
been
a
careless
man
who
thought
frugality
unnecessary
as
he
would
succeed
to
the
estate
on
his
father
death
but
he
died
of
consumption
in
a
year
before
that
event
took
place
one
of
his
sisters
married
into
the
family
of
the
stringers
neighbours
engaged
in
the
same
trade
as
the
austens
and
numbered
among
her
descendants
the
knights
of
godmersham
a
circumstance
which
exercised
an
important
influence
over
the
subsequent
fortunes
of
the
austen
family
elizabeth
weller
a
woman
happily
cast
in
a
different
mould
from
her
husband
was
an
ancestress
of
jane
austen
who
deserves
commemoration
thrifty
energetic
a
careful
mother
and
a
prudent
housewife
she
managed
though
receiving
only
grudging
assistance
from
the
austen
family
to
pay
off
her
husband
debts
and
to
give
to
all
her
younger
children
a
decent
education
at
a
school
at
sevenoaks
the
eldest
boy
the
future
squire
being
taken
off
her
hands
by
his
grandfather
elizabeth
left
behind
her
not
only
elaborately
kept
accounts
but
also
a
minute
description
of
her
actions
through
many
years
and
of
the
motives
which
governed
them
it
may
be
interesting
to
quote
one
sentence
relating
to
her
move
from
horsmonden
to
sevenoaks
for
the
sake
of
her
children
education
considerations
with
e
of
having
my
own
boys
in
e
house
with
a
good
master
as
all
represented
him
to
be
were
e
inducements
that
brought
me
to
for
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
i
cou
not
do
a
better
thing
for
my
children
good
their
education
being
my
great
care
and
indeed
all
i
think
i
was
capable
of
doing
for
for
i
always
if
they
had
learning
they
might
get
better

world
with
t
small
fortune

alloted
when
the
good
mother
died
in
her
work
was
done
schooldays
were
over
the
daughter
married
and
the
boys
already
making
their
way
in
the
world
the
young
squire
and
his
son
held
gentle
sway
at
broadford
through
the
eighteenth
century
but
much
more
stirring
and
able
was
the
next
brother
francis
he
became
a
solicitor
setting
up
at
sevenoaks
eight
hundred
pounds
and
a
bundle
of
pens
he
contrived
to
amass
a
very
large
fortune
living
most
hospitably
and
yet
buying
up
all
the
valuable
land
round
the
town
which
he
could
secure
and
enlarging
his
means
by
marrying
two
wealthy
wives
but
his
first
marriage
did
not
take
place
till
he
was
nearer
fifty
than
forty
and
he
had
as
a
bachelor
been
a
most
generous
benefactor
to
the
sons
of
his
two
next
brothers
thomas
and
william
his
second
wife
who
became
in
due
course
of
time
godmother
to
her
jane
austen
was
the
widow
of
samuel
lennard
of
west
wickham
who
left
her
his
estate
legal
proceedings
ensued
over
the
will
and
lennard
took
counsel
of
francis
austen
who
ended
by
winning
both
the
case
and
her
hand

his
first
wife

as

off

died
in
and
three
years
later
william
married
susanna
holk
of
whom
nothing
is
known
except
that
she
died
at
an
advanced
age
and
did
not
mention
any
of
the
austens
in
her
will
neither
is
there
any
trace
of
her
in
any
of
the
family
records
with
which
we
are
acquainted
so
it
is
hardly
probable
that
little
george
austen
jane
father
who
had
lost
both
his
parents
when
he
was
six
years
old
continued
under
the
care
of
his
stepmother
however
all
that
we
know
of
his
childhood
is
that
his
uncle
francis
befriended
him
and
sent
him
to
tonbridge
school
and
that
from
tonbridge
he
obtained
a
scholarship
and
subsequently
a
fellowship
at
john
college
oxford
the
college
at
which
later
on
through
george
own
marriage
his
descendants
were
to
be
kin
he
returned
to
teach
at
his
old
school
occupying
the
post
of
second
master
there
in
and
in
the
next
year
he
was
again
in
residence
at
oxford
where
his
good
looks
gained
for
him
the
name
of
handsome
proctor
in
he
took
orders
and
in
was
presented
by
knight
of
godmersham
who
had
married
a
descendant
of
his
jane
stringer
to
the
living
of
steventon
near
overton
in
hampshire
it
was
a
time
of
laxity
in
the
church
and
george
austen
though
he
afterwards
became
an
excellent
does
not
seem
to
have
resided
or
done
duty
at
steventon
before
the
year
when
his
marriage
to
cassandra
leigh
must
have
made
the
rectory
appear
a
desirable
home
to
which
to
bring
his
bride
before
we
say
anything
of
the
leighs
a
few
sentences
must
be
devoted
to
george
austen
relations
of
the
the
walters
with
his
mother
son
by
her
first
husband
william
hampson
walter
he
remained
on
intimate
terms
a
good
many
letters
are
extant
which
passed
between
the
austens
and
the
walters
during
the
early
married
life
of
the
former
the
last
of
them
containing
the
news
of
the
birth
of
jane
besides
this
william
walter
daughter
was
a
constant
correspondent
of
george
austen
niece
eliza
the
walter
family
settled
in
lincolnshire
where
they
have
held
church
preferment
and
have
also
been
well
known
in
the
world
of
sport
brother
james
seems
to
have
been
at
the
same
time
an
exemplary
parson
beloved
by
his
flock
and
also
a
sort
of
russell
and
is
said
to
have
met
his
death
in
the
by
falling
into
a
at
the
age
of
his
son
henry
distinguished
himself
in
a
more
academical
manner
he
was
second
wrangler
in
and
a
fellow
of
john
nor
was
he
only
a
mathematician
for
in
june
jane
austen
met
a
young
man
named
wilkes
an
undergraduate
of
john
who
spoke
very
highly
of
walter
as
a
scholar
he
said
he
was
considered
the
best
classic
at
cambridge
she
adds
such
a
report
would
have
interested
my
father
henry
walter
was
at
one
time
tutor
at
haileybury
and
was
also
a
beneficed
clergyman
he
was
known
at
court
indeed
it
is
said
that
while
he
declined
higher
preferment
for
himself
he
was
consulted
by
george
iv
and
william
iv
on
the
selection
of
bishops
the
wife
that
george
austen
chose
belonged
to
the
somewhat
large
clan
of
the
leighs
of
adlestrop
in
gloucestershire
of
which
family
the
leighs
of
stoneleigh
were
a
younger
branch
her
father
was
the
rev
thomas
leigh
elected
fellow
of
all
souls
at
so
early
an
age
that
he
was
ever
after
called
leigh
and
afterwards
rector
of
harpsden
near
henley
both
these
branches
of
the
leigh
family
descended
from
sir
thomas
leigh
lord
mayor
of
london
behind
whom
queen
elizabeth
rode
to
be
proclaimed
at
paul
cross
he
was
rich
enough
and
great
enough
to
endow
more
than
one
son
with
estates
but
while
the
elder
line
at
adlestrop
remained
simple
squires
the
younger
at
stoneleigh
rose
to
a
peerage
the
latter
branch
however
were
now
rapidly
approaching
extinction
while
the
former
had
many
vigorous
scions
the
family
records
have
much
to
say
of
one
of
the
squires
theophilus
who
died
in
the
husband
of
mary
brydges
and
the
father
of
twelve
children
a
strong
character
and
one
who
lived
up
to
fixed
if
rather
narrow
ideas
of
duty
we
hear
of
his
dress
and
elaborate
bows
and
postures
of
his
affability
to
his
neighbours
and
his
just
though
somewhat
strict
government
of
his
sons
it
is
difficult
to
picture
to
oneself
a
set
of
modern
oxford
men
standing
patiently
after
dinner
in
the
as
theophilus
sons
did
desired
to
sit
down
and
drink
church
and
king
meanwhile
his
the
duke
of
chandos
the
patron
of
handel
used
to
send
for
the
daughters
to
be
educated
in
the
splendour
of
canons
his
place
in
middlesex
and
to
make
such
matches
as
he
chose
for
them
with
dowries
of
cassandra
father
thomas
was
the
fourth
son
of
theophilus
leigh
an
older
and
better
known
brother
was
another
theophilus
master
of
balliol
for
more
than
half
a
century
the
story
of
his
election
in
is
remarkable
the
fellows
of
balliol
could
not
agree
in
the
choice
of
any
one
of
their
own
body
and
one
set
thinking
it
would
be
no
disadvantage
to
have
a
duke
brother
as
master
invited
their
visitor
brydges
to
stand
on
his
declining
they
brought
forward
his
nephew
theophilus
leigh
then
a
young
fellow
of
corpus
the
election
resulted
in
a
tie
and
the
visitor
had
no
qualms
of
conscience
in
giving
his
casting
vote
to
his
nephew
theophilus
proved
to
be
a
man
famous
for
his
sayings
than
his
doings
overflowing
with
puns
and
witticisms
and
sharp
retorts
but
his
most
serious
joke
was
his
practical
one
of
living
much
longer
than
had
been
expected
or
intended
he
no
doubt
became
a
most
dignified
head
and
inspired
the
young
men
with
fear
and
respect
but
he
must
have
sometimes
remembered
the
awful
day
when
he
first
preached
before
his
father
who
immediately
turned
his
back
on
the
divine
saying
afterwards
thank
you
theo
for
your
discourse
let
us
hereafter
have
less
rhetoric
and
more
divinity
i
turned
my
back
lest
my
presence
might
daunt
you
when
theo
in
turn
was
an
old
man
and
when
jane
austen
eldest
brother
went
to
oxford
he
was
asked
to
dine
with
this
dignified
kinsman
being
a
raw
freshman
he
was
about
to
take
off
his
gown
when
the
old
man
of
eighty
said
with
a
grim
smile
man
you
need
not
strip
we
are
not
going
to
fight
cassandra
leigh
youth
was
spent
in
the
quiet
rectory
of
harpsden
for
her
father
was
one
of
the
more
conscientious
of
the
gently
born
clergy
of
that
day
living
entirely
on
his
benefice
and
greatly
beloved
in
his
neighbourhood
as
an
exemplary
was
one
of
the
most
contented
quiet
generous
cheerful
men
i
ever
knew
so
says
the
chronicler
of
the
leigh
family
his
wife
was
his
counterpart
the
spirit
of
the
pugnacious
theophilus
dwelt
not
in
him
nor
that
eternal
love
of
company
which
distinguished
the
other
brothers
yet
he
was
by
no
means
unsocial
towards
the
end
of
his
life
he
removed
to
bath
being
severely
afflicted
with
the
gout
and
here
he
died
in
his
peaceful
wife
jane
walker
was
descended
on
her
side
from
a
sufficiently
warlike
family
she
was
the
daughter
of
an
oxford
physician
who
had
married
a
miss
perrot
one
of
the
last
of
a
very
old
stock
long
settled
in
oxfordshire
but
also
known
in
pembrokeshire
at
least
as
early
as
the
fourteenth
century
they
were
probably
among
the
settlers
planted
there
to
overawe
the
welsh
and
it
is
recorded
of
one
of
them
that
he
slew
men
of
kemaes
and
one
wolf
a
contrast
to
these
uncompromising
ancestors
was
found
in
leigh
aunt
ann
perrot
one
of
the
family
circle
at
harpsden
whom
tradition
states
to
have
been
a
very
pious
good
woman
unselfish
she
certainly
was
for
she
earnestly
begged
her
brother
thomas
perrot
to
alter
his
will
by
which
he
had
bequeathed
to
her
his
estates
at
northleigh
in
oxfordshire
and
to
leave
her
instead
an
annuity
of
one
hundred
pounds
her
brother
complied
with
her
request
and
by
a
codicil
devised
the
estates
to
his
james
son
of
the
rev
thomas
leigh
on
condition
that
he
took
the
surname
and
arms
of
perrot
accordingly
on
the
death
of
thomas
perrot
at
the
beginning
of
james
leigh
became
james
leigh
perrot
of
northleigh
his
two
sisters
jane
and
cassandra
also
profited
by
the
kindness
of
their
who
left
two
hundred
pounds
to
each
another
legacy
which
filtered
through
the
walkers
from
the
perrots
to
the
austens
was
the
advantage
of
being
to
the
founder
of
john
college
oxford
sir
thomas
white
an
advantage
of
which
several
members
of
the
family
availed
themselves
northleigh
for
some
reason
or
other
did
not
suit
its
new
owner
he
pulled
down
the
mansion
and
sold
the
estate
to
the
duke
of
marlborough
buying
for
himself
a
property
at
hare
hatch
on
the
bath
road
midway
between
maidenhead
and
reading
we
shall
meet
him
again
and
his
devoted
wife
jane
cholmeley
and
we
shall
see
a
remarkable
instance
of
his
steadfast
love
for
her
george
austen
perhaps
met
his
future
wife
at
the
house
of
her
uncle
the
master
of
balliol
but
no
particulars
of
the
courtship
have
survived
the
marriage
took
place
at
walcot
church
bath
on
april
the
bride
father
having
died
at
bath
only
a
short
time
before
two
circumstances
connected
with
their
brief
honeymoon
which
consisted
only
of
a
journey
from
bath
to
steventon
broken
by
one
day
halt
at
andover
may
be
mentioned
the
bride
dress
seems
to
have
been
a
scarlet
whose
future
adventures
were
not
uninteresting
and
the
pair
are
believed
to
have
had
an
unusual
companion
for
such
an
occasion
namely
a
small
boy
six
years
old
the
only
son
of
warren
hastings
by
his
first
wife
we
are
told
that
he
was
committed
to
the
charge
of
austen
when
he
was
sent
over
to
england
in
and
we
shall
see
later
that
there
was
a
reason
for
this
connexion
but
a
boy
is
a
curious
charge
for
a
bachelor
and
poor
little
george
must
have
wanted
a
nurse
rather
than
a
tutor
in
any
case
he
came
under
austen
maternal
care
who
afterwards
mourned
for
his
early
death
if
he
had
been
a
child
of
her
own
footnotes
of
for
further
particulars
respecting
the
earlier
austens
we
venture
to
refer
our
readers
to
manor
and
its
chap
vii
this
almost
exclusive
care
of
the
old
man
for
his
eldest
grandson
may
possibly
have
been
the
model
for
the
action
of
old
dashwood
at
the
beginning
of
and
we
are
allowed
to
quote
freely
from
a
manuscript
of
the
leigh
family
of
written
in
some
part
of
which
appeared
in
an
article
written
by
the
hon
agnes
leigh
and
published
in
the
for
april
brother
both
of
the
duke
of
chandos
and
of
leigh
the
author
of
the
remarks
on
the
fact
that
the
leigh
arms
were
placed
on
the
front
of
balliol
towards
broad
street
now
pulled
down
he
did
not
live
to
see
the
same
arms
occupy
a
similar
place
on
the
new
buildings
at
king
college
cambridge
erected
when
his
son
augustus
was
provost
the
perrots
seem
to
have
set
great
store
by
their
armorial
bearings
at
least
we
are
told
that
two
branches
of
them
lived
at
northleigh
at
the
same
time
in
the
eighteenth
century
hardly
on
speaking
terms
with
each
other
and
that
one
cause
of
quarrel
was
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
whether
the
three
which
in
punning
heraldry
formed
a
part
of
their
coat
of
arms
were
to
be
silver
or
gold
in
the
absence
of
any
information
as
to
where
george
hastings
died
or
was
buried
it
is
at
present
impossible
to
be
sure
about
the
details
of
this
interesting
tradition
chapter
ii
steventon
steventon
is
a
small
village
tucked
away
among
the
hampshire
downs
about
seven
miles
south
of
basingstoke
it
is
now
looked
down
upon
at
close
quarters
by
the
railway
but
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
writing
it
was
almost
equidistant
from
two
main
roads
one
running
from
basingstoke
to
andover
which
would
be
joined
at
deane
gate
the
other
from
basingstoke
to
winchester
joined
at
popham
lane
communication
with
london
was
maintained
at
any
rate
in
by
two
coaches
that
ran
each
night
through
deane
gate
it
does
not
appear
however
to
have
been
by
any
means
certain
that
an
unexpected
traveller
would
get
a
place
in
either
of
them
the
surrounding
country
is
certainly
not
picturesque
it
presents
no
grand
or
extensive
views
the
features
however
being
small
rather
than
plain
it
is
in
fact
an
undulating
district
whose
hills
have
no
marked
character
and
the
poverty
of
whose
soil
prevents
the
timber
from
attaining
a
great
size
we
need
not
therefore
be
surprised
to
hear
that
when
cassandra
leigh
saw
the
place
for
the
first
time
just
before
her
marriage
she
should
think
it
very
inferior
to
the
valley
of
the
thames
at
henley
yet
the
neighbourhood
had
its
beauties
of
rustic
lanes
and
hidden
nooks
and
steventon
from
the
fall
of
the
ground
and
the
abundance
of
its
timber
was
one
of
the
prettiest
spots
in
it
the
rectory
had
been
of
the
most
miserable
description
but
george
austen
improved
it
until
it
became
a
tolerably
roomy
and
convenient
habitation
it
stood
a
shallow
valley
surrounded
by
sloping
meadows
well
sprinkled
with
at
the
end
of
a
small
village
of
cottages
each
well
provided
with
a
garden
scattered
about
prettily
on
either
side
of
the
road
north
of
the
house
the
road
from
deane
to
popham
lane
ran
at
a
sufficient
distance
from
the
front
to
allow
a
carriage
drive
through
turf
and
trees
on
the
south
side
the
ground
rose
gently
and
was
occupied
by
one
of
those
gardens
in
which
vegetables
and
flowers
are
combined
flanked
and
protected
on
the
east
by
one
of
the
thatched
mud
walls
common
in
that
country
and
overshadowed
by
fine
elms
along
the
upper
or
southern
side
of
the
garden
ran
a
terrace
of
the
finest
turf
which
must
have
been
in
the
writer
thoughts
when
she
described
catherine
morland
childish
delight
in
rolling
down
the
green
slope
at
the
back
of
the
house
the
chief
beauty
of
steventon
consisted
in
its
hedgerows
a
hedgerow
in
that
country
does
not
mean
a
thin
formal
line
of
quickset
but
an
irregular
border
of
and
timber
often
wide
enough
to
contain
within
it
a
winding
footpath
or
a
rough
under
its
shelter
the
earliest
primroses
anemones
and
wild
hyacinths
were
to
be
found
sometimes
the
first
bird
nest
and
now
and
then
the
unwelcome
adder
two
such
hedgerows
radiated
as
it
were
from
the
parsonage
garden
one
a
continuation
of
the
turf
terrace
proceeded
westward
forming
the
southern
boundary
of
the
home
meadows
and
was
formed
into
a
rustic
shrubbery
with
occasional
seats
entitled
the
wood
walk
the
other
ran
straight
up
the
hill
under
the
name
of
the
church
walk
because
it
led
to
the
parish
church
as
well
as
to
a
fine
old
of
henry
viii
time
occupied
by
a
family
named
digweed
who
for
more
than
a
century
rented
it
together
with
the
chief
farm
in
the
parish
the
usefulness
of
a
hedgerow
as
a
place
where
a
heroine
might
remain
unseen
and
overhear
what
was
not
intended
to
reach
her
ears
must
have
impressed
itself
early
on
the
mind
of
our
author
and
readers
of
will
remember
the
scene
in
the
fields
near
uppercross
where
anne
hears
a
conversation
about
herself
carried
on
by
captain
wentworth
and
louisa
musgrove
the
writer
had
possibly
intended
to
introduce
a
similar
scene
into
for
in
a
letter
to
her
sister
of
january
when
turning
from
and
to
a
new
subject
she
says
you
could
discover
whether
northamptonshire
is
a
country
of
hedgerows
i
should
be
glad
again
presumably
her
question
was
answered
in
the
negative
and
her
scrupulous
desire
for
accuracy
did
not
allow
of
her
making
use
of
the
intended
device
steventon
church
have
appeared
mean
and
uninteresting
to
an
ordinary
observer
but
the
adept
in
church
architecture
would
have
known
that
it
must
have
stood
there
some
seven
centuries
and
would
have
found
beauty
in
the
very
narrow
early
english
windows
as
well
as
in
the
general
proportions
of
its
little
chancel
while
its
solitary
position
far
from
the
hum
of
the
village
and
within
sight
of
no
habitation
except
a
glimpse
of
the
grey
through
its
circling
green
of
sycamores
has
in
it
something
solemn
and
appropriate
to
the
last
of
the
silent
dead
sweet
violets
both
purple
and
white
grow
in
abundance
beneath
its
south
wall
one
may
imagine
for
how
many
centuries
the
ancestors
of
those
little
flowers
have
occupied
that
undisturbed
sunny
nook
and
may
think
how
few
living
families
can
boast
of
as
ancient
a
tenure
of
their
land
large
elms
protrude
their
rough
branches
old
hawthorns
shed
their
annual
blossoms
over
the
graves
and
the
hollow
must
be
at
least
coeval
with
the
church
but
whatever
may
be
the
beauties
or
defects
of
the
surrounding
scenery
this
was
the
residence
of
jane
austen
for
years
this
was
the
cradle
of
her
genius
these
were
the
first
objects
which
inspired
her
young
heart
with
a
sense
of
the
beauties
of
nature
in
strolls
along
these
fancies
rose
to
her
mind
and
gradually
assumed
the
forms
in
which
they
came
forth
to
the
world
in
that
simple
church
she
brought
them
all
into
subjection
to
the
piety
which
ruled
her
in
life
and
supported
her
in
death
to
this
description
of
the
surroundings
of
the
home
given
by
the
author
of
the
whose
own
home
it
was
through
childhood
and
boyhood
we
may
add
a
few
sentences
respecting
its
interior
as
it
appeared
to
his
sister
lefroy
she
speaks
of
her
grandfather
study
looking
cheerfully
into
the
sunny
garden
own
exclusive
property
safe
from
the
bustle
of
all
household
cares
and
adds
common
looked
to
the
front
and
was
lighted
by
two
casement
windows
on
the
same
side
the
front
door
opened
into
a
smaller
parlour
and
visitors
who
were
few
and
rare
were
not
a
bit
the
less
welcome
to
my
grandmother
because
they
found
her
sitting
there
busily
engaged
with
her
needle
making
and
mending
in
later
times
but
not
probably
until
my
two
aunts
had
completed
their
short
course
at
latournelle
at
reading
abbey
and
were
living
at
home
a
was
made
upstairs
the
as
they
were
pleased
to
call
it
perhaps
because
it
opened
into
a
smaller
chamber
in
which
my
two
aunts
slept
i
remember
the
carpet
with
its
chocolate
ground
and
painted
press
with
shelves
above
for
books
and
jane
piano
and
an
oval
that
hung
between
the
windows
but
the
charm
of
the
room
with
its
scanty
furniture
and
cheaply
painted
walls
must
have
been
for
those
old
enough
to
understand
it
the
flow
of
native
wit
with
all
the
fun
and
nonsense
of
a
large
and
clever
family
such
was
the
room
in
which
the
first
versions
of
and
and
and
were
composed
we
have
anticipated
somewhat
in
describing
the
rectory
as
it
appeared
after
george
austen
reforms
and
when
his
children
were
growing
up
in
it
as
it
appeared
to
him
and
his
wife
on
their
arrival
it
must
have
left
much
to
be
desired
the
young
couple
who
now
entered
upon
a
home
which
was
to
be
theirs
for
years
had
many
excellent
and
attractive
qualities
george
austen
handsome
placid
dignified
features
were
an
index
to
his
mind
serene
in
temper
devoted
to
his
religion
and
his
family
a
good
father
and
a
good
scholar
he
deserved
the
love
and
respect
which
every
evidence
that
we
have
shows
him
to
have
gained
from
his
family
and
his
neighbours
his
wife
was
a
somewhat
more
positive
nature
shrewd
and
acute
and
determined
with
a
strong
sense
of
humour
and
with
an
energy
capable
of
triumphing
over
years
of
indifferent
health
she
was
ardently
attached
to
her
children
and
perhaps
somewhat
proud
of
her
ancestors
we
are
told
that
she
was
very
particular
about
the
shape
of
people
noses
having
a
very
aristocratic
one
herself
but
we
ought
perhaps
to
add
that
she
admitted
she
had
never
been
a
beauty
at
all
events
in
comparison
with
her
own
elder
sister
if
one
may
divide
qualities
which
often
overlap
one
would
be
inclined
to
surmise
that
jane
austen
inherited
from
her
father
her
serenity
of
mind
the
refinement
of
her
intellect
and
her
delicate
appreciation
of
style
while
her
mother
supplied
the
acute
observation
of
character
and
the
wit
and
humour
for
which
she
was
equally
distinguished
steventon
was
not
the
only
preferment
in
the
neighbourhood
that
george
austen
was
to
hold
his
kind
uncle
francis
who
had
helped
him
in
his
schooling
was
anxious
to
do
something
more
for
him
he
would
have
liked
it
is
said
to
have
put
him
into
the
comfortable
living
of
west
wickham
in
kent
which
was
in
the
gift
of
his
wife
but
he
considered
that
another
nephew
the
son
of
a
brother
older
than
george
father
had
a
prior
claim
francis
however
did
the
best
thing
he
could
by
buying
the
next
presentations
of
two
parishes
near
steventon
namely
ashe
and
deane
that
his
nephew
might
have
whichever
fell
vacant
first
the
chances
of
an
early
vacancy
at
ashe
where
russell
the
grandfather
of
mary
russell
mitford
had
been
established
since
must
have
seemed
the
greater
but
fate
decided
otherwise
russell
lived
till
and
it
was
deane
that
first
fell
vacant
in
the
writer
of
the
who
was
under
the
impression
that
george
austen
became
rector
of
both
steventon
and
deane
in
states
that
the
austens
began
their
married
life
in
the
parsonage
at
deane
and
did
not
move
to
steventon
till
seven
years
later
this
can
not
be
quite
correct
because
we
have
letters
of
george
austen
dated
from
steventon
in
nor
is
it
quite
easy
to
understand
why
austen
should
have
lived
in
some
one
else
rectory
in
preference
to
his
own
unless
we
conceive
that
the
rector
of
deane
was
and
that
george
austen
did
duty
at
deane
and
rented
the
parsonage
while
his
own
was
under
repair
it
seems
impossible
now
to
unravel
this
skein
the
story
of
the
move
to
steventon
in
is
connected
with
a
statement
that
the
road
was
then
a
mere
so
cut
up
by
deep
ruts
as
to
be
impassable
for
a
light
carriage
and
that
austen
who
was
not
then
in
good
health
performed
the
short
journey
on
a
placed
upon
some
soft
articles
of
furniture
in
the
waggon
which
held
their
household
goods
this
story
is
too
circumstantial
to
be
without
foundation
nor
is
there
any
reason
to
doubt
the
badness
of
a
country
lane
but
the
particular
referred
to
must
be
left
uncertain
george
austen
was
years
old
when
he
settled
down
at
his
hampshire
living
his
wife
was
some
eight
years
younger
their
means
were
not
large
but
george
was
able
to
supplement
his
income
both
by
farming
and
by
taking
pupils
life
too
was
simpler
in
those
days
and
we
read
of
austen
being
without
a
new
gown
for
two
years
and
spending
much
of
the
time
in
a
red
which
even
then
had
not
finished
its
usefulness
for
it
was
cut
up
some
years
later
into
a
suit
for
one
of
her
boys
her
time
indeed
was
soon
busily
employed
her
eldest
boy
james
was
born
on
february
the
second
george
on
august
and
the
third
edward
on
october
the
austens
followed
what
was
a
common
custom
in
those
days
namely
that
of
putting
out
their
children
to
nurse
an
honest
woman
in
deane
had
charge
of
them
all
in
turn
and
we
are
told
that
one
or
both
of
their
parents
visited
them
every
day
the
only
excitements
to
vary
the
tranquil
life
at
steventon
were
occasional
visits
to
or
from
their
near
relations
cassandra
brother
was
now
living
on
his
property
called
scarlets
at
hare
hatch
in
the
parish
of
wargrave
and
was
thus
within
a
day
journey
from
steventon
he
had
married
a
miss
cholmeley
of
easton
in
lincolnshire
but
they
had
no
children
cassandra
only
sister
jane
the
beauty
of
the
family
was
married
at
the
end
of
to
cooper
rector
of
whaddon
near
bath
edward
cooper
was
the
son
of
gislingham
cooper
a
banker
in
the
strand
by
ann
whitelock
heiress
of
phyllis
court
and
henley
manor
and
cooper
divided
their
time
between
his
house
at
southcote
near
reading
and
bath
from
which
latter
place
no
doubt
he
could
keep
an
eye
on
his
neighbouring
parish
the
coopers
had
two
children
edward
and
jane
they
and
the
austens
were
on
very
intimate
terms
and
it
is
probable
that
jane
austen
early
knowledge
of
bath
was
to
a
great
extent
owing
to
the
visits
paid
to
them
in
that
place
another
family
with
whom
the
austens
were
on
cousinly
terms
were
the
cookes
samuel
cooke
rector
of
little
bookham
in
surrey
and
godfather
to
jane
had
married
a
daughter
of
the
master
of
balliol
theophilus
leigh
and
their
three
children
theophilus
mary
and
george
belonged
like
the
coopers
to
an
inner
circle
of
relations
on
both
sides
leigh
perrots
coopers
cookes
walters
and
hancocks
who
made
up
in
addition
to
the
of
country
neighbours
the
world
in
which
the
austens
moved
a
few
letters
addressed
to
and
walter
extracts
from
which
we
shall
venture
to
quote
will
give
the
best
idea
of
the
happy
peaceful
life
passed
at
steventon
rectory
during
these
early
years
on
july
george
writes
from
steventon
of
his
wife
journey
to
london
to
be
present
at
the
birth
of
her
sister
child
and
adds
my
james
and
his
brother
are
both
well
and
what
will
surprise
you
bear
their
mother
absence
with
great
philosophy
as
i
doubt
not
they
would
mine
and
turn
all
their
little
affections
towards
those
who
were
about
them
and
good
to
them
this
may
not
be
a
pleasing
reflection
to
a
fond
parent
but
is
certainly
wisely
designed
by
providence
for
the
happiness
of
the
child
a
month
or
so
later
cassandra
is
back
again
and
writing
i
was
not
so
happy
as
to
see
my
nephew
weaver
suppose
he
was
hurried
in
time
as
i
think
everyone
is
in
town
is
a
sad
place
i
would
not
live
in
it
on
any
account
one
has
not
time
to
do
one
duty
either
to
god
or
man
what
luck
we
shall
have
with
those
sort
of
cows
i
ca
say
my
little
alderney
one
turns
out
tolerably
well
and
makes
more
butter
than
we
use
and
i
have
just
bought
another
of
the
same
sort
but
as
her
calf
is
but
just
gone
can
not
say
what
she
will
be
good
for
yet
my
poor
little
george
is
come
to
see
me
he
seems
pretty
well
tho
he
had
a
fit
lately
it
was
near
a
since
he
had
one
before
so
was
in
hopes
they
had
left
him
but
must
not
flatter
myself
so
now
in
june
the
austens
fourth
child
henry
was
born
and
austen
writes
on
november
my
little
boy
is
come
home
from
nurse
and
a
fine
stout
little
fellow
he
is
and
can
run
anywhere
so
now
i
have
all
four
at
home
and
some
time
in
january
i
expect
a
fifth
so
you
see
it
will
not
be
in
my
power
to
take
any
journeys
for
one
while
i
believe
my
sister
hancock
will
be
so
good
as
to
come
and
nurse
me
again
unfortunately
poor
little
george
never
recovered
sufficiently
to
take
his
place
in
the
family
and
we
hear
no
more
of
him
though
he
lived
on
as
late
as
the
fifth
child
cassandra
was
born
in
january
and
on
june
austen
writes
we
will
not
give
up
the
hopes
of
seeing
you
both
and
as
many
of
your
young
people
as
you
can
conveniently
bring
at
steventon
before
the
summer
is
over
austen
wants
to
show
his
brother
his
lands
and
his
cattle
and
many
other
matters
and
i
want
to
show
you
my
henry
and
my
cassy
who
are
both
reckoned
fine
children
jemmy
and
neddy
are
very
happy
in
a
new
playfellow
lord
lymington
whom
austen
has
lately
taken
the
charge
of
he
is
between
five
and
six
years
old
very
backward
of
his
age
but
and
orderly
he
is
the
eldest
son
of
lord
portsmouth
who
lives
about
ten
miles
from
hence
i
have
got
a
nice
dairy
fitted
up
and
am
now
worth
a
bull
and
six
cows
and
you
would
laugh
to
see
them
for
they
are
not
much
bigger
than
and
here
i
have
got
duckies
and
ducks
and
chickens
for
amusement
in
short
you
must
come
and
like
hezekiah
i
will
show
you
all
my
riches
i
thank
god
we
are
all
quite
well
and
my
little
girl
is
almost
ready
to
run
away
our
new
pupil
master
vanderstegen
has
been
with
us
about
a
month
he
is
near
fourteen
years
old
and
is
very
good
tempered
and
well
disposed
lord
lymington
has
left
us
his
mamma
began
to
be
alarmed
at
the
hesitation
in
his
speech
which
certainly
grew
worse
and
is
going
to
take
him
to
london
in
hopes
a
angier
who
undertakes
to
cure
that
disorder
may
be
of
service
to
him
a
sixth
child
francis
william
was
born
in
april
we
are
all
i
thank
god
in
good
health
and
i
am
more
nimble
and
active
than
i
was
last
time
expect
to
be
confined
some
time
in
november
my
last
boy
is
very
stout
and
has
run
alone
these
two
months
and
is
not
yet
sixteen
months
old
my
little
girl
talks
all
day
long
and
in
my
opinion
is
a
very
entertaining
companion
henry
has
been
in
breeches
some
months
and
thinks
himself
near
as
good
a
man
as
his
brother
neddy
indeed
no
one
would
judge
by
their
looks
that
there
was
above
three
years
and
a
half
difference
in
their
ages
one
is
so
little
and
the
other
so
great
master
van
is
got
very
well
again
and
has
been
with
us
again
these
three
months
he
is
gone
home
this
morning
for
a
few
holidays
the
new
infant
however
did
not
appear
quite
so
soon
as
was
expected
and
the
last
letter
of
the
series
is
written
by
george
austen
on
december
steventon
december
dear
sister
you
have
doubtless
been
for
some
time
in
expectation
of
hearing
from
hampshire
and
perhaps
wondered
a
little
we
were
in
our
old
age
grown
such
bad
reckoners
but
so
it
was
for
cassy
certainly
expected
to
have
been
brought
to
bed
a
month
ago
however
last
night
the
time
came
and
without
a
great
deal
of
warning
everything
was
soon
happily
over
we
have
now
another
girl
a
present
plaything
for
her
sister
cassy
and
a
future
companion
she
is
to
be
jenny
and
seems
to
me
as
if
she
would
be
as
like
harry
as
cassy
is
to
neddy
your
sister
thank
god
is
pure
well
after
it
george
austen
prediction
was
fully
justified
never
were
sisters
more
to
each
other
than
cassandra
and
jane
while
in
a
particularly
affectionate
family
there
seems
to
have
been
a
special
link
between
cassandra
and
edward
on
the
one
hand
and
between
jane
and
henry
on
the
other
jane
godparents
were
musgrave
a
connexion
of
her
mother
francis
austen
another
jane
wife
of
george
kind
uncle
and
samuel
cooke
rector
of
little
bookham
we
may
suppose
that
like
the
rest
of
her
family
she
spent
a
considerable
part
of
the
first
eighteen
months
of
her
existence
at
the
good
woman
at
deane
we
have
indeed
but
little
information
about
the
household
at
steventon
for
the
next
few
years
another
child
the
last
charles
was
born
in
june
there
must
as
the
children
grew
older
have
been
a
bright
and
lively
family
party
to
fill
the
rectory
all
the
more
so
because
the
boys
were
educated
at
home
instead
of
being
sent
to
any
school
one
of
george
austen
sons
has
described
him
as
being
only
a
profound
scholar
but
possessed
of
a
most
exquisite
taste
in
every
species
of
literature
and
even
if
we
allow
for
some
filial
exaggeration
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
was
a
home
where
good
teaching
in
every
sense
of
the
word
good
taste
and
a
general
love
of
reading
prevailed
to
balance
this
characteristic
the
austen
nature
possessed
yet
another
spread
over
many
members
of
the
family
namely
an
enthusiastic
love
of
sport
the
boys
hunted
from
an
early
age
in
a
scrambling
sort
of
way
upon
any
pony
or
donkey
that
they
could
procure
or
in
default
of
such
luxuries
on
foot
perhaps
beginning
the
day
with
an
early
breakfast
in
the
kitchen
a
wonderful
story
is
told
on
good
authority
of
a
piece
of
amateur
accomplished
by
the
youngest
son
but
one
francis
at
the
mature
age
of
seven
how
he
bought
on
his
own
account
it
must
be
supposed
with
his
father
permission
a
pony
for
hunted
it
jumping
everything
that
the
pony
could
get
its
nose
over
and
at
the
end
of
two
years
sold
it
again
for
it
was
a
bright
chestnut
and
he
called
it
though
his
elder
brothers
to
plague
him
called
it
this
was
the
boy
for
whose
benefit
his
mother
converted
into
a
jacket
and
trousers
the
scarlet
which
played
so
important
a
part
in
her
early
married
life
if
he
mounted
in
this
costume
the
future
admiral
of
the
fleet
was
hunting
pink
with
a
vengeance
and
must
have
contributed
not
a
little
to
the
gaiety
of
the
field
it
is
evident
that
part
of
the
good
training
at
steventon
consisted
in
making
the
boys
while
quite
young
manly
active
and
when
the
time
came
for
their
leaving
home
they
would
not
be
found
unprepared
austen
found
it
a
pleasant
task
to
educate
his
own
sons
with
his
other
pupils
and
thereby
to
dispense
with
the
cost
of
public
schools
we
get
a
glimpse
of
him
as
a
teacher
in
a
letter
of
his
son
henry
written
many
years
later
to
warren
hastings
henry
by
the
way
made
use
of
a
style
that
one
is
thankful
jane
did
not
adopt
suffer
me
to
say
that
among
the
earliest
lessons
of
my
infancy
i
was
taught
by
precept
and
example
to
love
and
venerate
your
name
i
can
not
remember
the
time
when
i
did
not
associate
with
your
character
the
idea
of
everything
great
amiable
and
good
your
benevolence
was
a
theme
on
which
my
young
attention
hung
with
truer
worship
than
courtiers
ever
pay
the
throne
your
works
of
taste
both
of
the
pencil
and
the
pen
were
continually
offered
to
my
notice
as
objects
of
imitation
and
spurs
to
exertion
i
shall
never
forget
the
delight
which
i
experienced
when
on
producing
a
translation
of
a
ode
of
horace
to
my
father
criticism
he
favoured
me
with
a
perusal
of
your
manuscript
and
as
a
high
mark
of
commendation
said
that
he
was
sure
hastings
would
have
been
pleased
with
the
perusal
of
my
humble
essay
there
is
also
a
pleasant
picture
of
home
life
at
steventon
drawn
for
us
in
the
of
the
leigh
in
which
the
writer
speaks
of
cassandra
of
the
truly
respectable
austen
and
adds
his
sons
all
promising
to
make
figures
in
life
austen
educates
a
few
youths
of
chosen
friends
and
acquaintances
when
among
this
liberal
society
the
simplicity
hospitality
and
taste
which
commonly
prevail
in
affluent
families
among
the
delightful
valleys
of
switzerland
ever
recur
to
my
memory
but
though
it
might
be
an
easy
thing
to
educate
his
sons
at
home
it
was
another
matter
to
teach
his
daughters
and
according
to
a
family
tradition
cassandra
and
jane
were
dispatched
at
a
very
early
age
to
spend
a
year
at
oxford
with
cawley
a
sister
of
cooper
a
fact
which
makes
it
likely
that
their
cousin
jane
cooper
was
also
of
the
party
cawley
was
the
widow
of
a
principal
of
brasenose
college
and
is
said
to
have
been
a
person
she
moved
presently
to
southampton
and
there
also
had
the
three
girls
under
her
charge
at
the
latter
place
cassandra
and
jane
austen
were
attacked
by
a
putrid
fever
cawley
would
not
write
word
of
this
to
steventon
but
jane
cooper
thought
it
right
to
do
so
upon
which
austen
and
cooper
set
off
at
once
for
southampton
and
took
their
daughters
away
jane
austen
was
very
ill
and
nearly
died
worse
befell
poor
cooper
who
took
the
infection
and
died
at
bath
whither
she
had
returned
as
cooper
died
in
october
this
fixes
the
date
roughly
when
the
sisters
went
to
oxford
and
southampton
jane
would
have
been
full
young
to
profit
from
the
instruction
of
masters
at
oxford
she
can
hardly
have
been
seven
years
old
when
she
went
there
and
it
must
have
been
more
for
the
sake
of
her
being
with
cassandra
than
for
any
other
reason
that
she
was
sent
on
the
same
principle
she
went
to
school
at
reading
soon
after
the
southampton
experience
we
are
told
she
was
thought
old
enough
to
profit
much
by
the
instruction
there
imparted
but
because
she
would
have
been
miserable
without
her
sister
her
mother
in
fact
observing
that
cassandra
were
going
to
have
her
head
cut
off
jane
would
insist
on
sharing
her
fate
the
school
chosen
was
a
famous
one
in
its
day
namely
the
abbey
school
in
the
forbury
at
reading
kept
by
a
latournelle
an
englishwoman
married
to
a
frenchman
miss
butt
afterwards
sherwood
who
went
to
the
same
school
in
says
in
her
autobiography
that
latournelle
never
could
speak
a
word
of
french
indeed
she
describes
her
as
person
of
the
old
school
a
stout
woman
hardly
under
seventy
but
very
active
although
she
had
a
cork
leg
she
was
only
fit
for
giving
out
clothes
for
the
wash
and
mending
them
making
tea
ordering
dinner
and
in
fact
doing
the
work
of
a
housekeeper
but
in
sherwood
time
she
had
a
capable
assistant
in
madame
quentin
an
englishwoman
married
to
the
son
of
a
nobleman
in
alsace
who
in
troubled
times
had
been
glad
to
accept
the
position
of
french
teacher
at
reading
grammar
school
under
valpy
sherwood
says
that
the
quentins
so
entirely
raised
the
credit
of
the
seminary
that
when
she
went
there
it
contained
above
sixty
pupils
the
history
of
the
school
did
not
end
with
reading
for
the
quentins
afterwards
removed
to
hans
place
where
they
had
under
their
charge
mary
russell
mitford
still
later
after
the
fall
of
napoleon
the
quentins
moved
to
paris
together
with
miss
rowden
who
had
long
been
the
mainstay
of
the
school
it
was
while
the
school
was
here
that
it
received
fanny
kemble
among
its
pupils
sherwood
tells
us
that
the
at
reading
rather
the
abbey
itself
was
exceedingly
interesting
the
ancient
building
consisted
of
a
gateway
with
rooms
above
and
on
each
side
of
it
a
vast
staircase
of
which
the
balustrades
had
originally
been
gilt
the
best
part
of
the
house
was
encompassed
by
a
beautiful
garden
where
the
young
ladies
were
allowed
to
wander
under
tall
trees
in
hot
summer
evenings
discipline
was
not
severe
for
the
same
lady
informs
us
liberty
which
the
first
class
had
was
so
great
that
if
we
attended
our
tutor
in
his
study
for
an
hour
or
two
every
morning
no
human
being
ever
took
the
trouble
to
inquire
where
else
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
between
our
meals
thus
whether
we
gossiped
in
one
turret
or
another
whether
we
lounged
about
the
garden
or
out
of
the
window
above
the
gateway
no
one
so
much
as
said
where
have
you
been
mademoiselle
after
reading
this
we
are
no
longer
surprised
to
be
told
that
cassandra
and
jane
together
with
their
cousin
jane
cooper
were
allowed
to
accept
an
invitation
to
dine
at
an
inn
with
their
respective
brothers
edward
austen
and
edward
cooper
and
some
of
their
young
friends
school
life
does
not
appear
to
have
left
any
very
deep
impression
on
jane
austen
probably
she
went
at
too
youthful
an
age
and
her
stay
was
too
short
at
any
rate
none
of
the
heroines
of
her
novels
except
anne
elliot
are
sent
to
school
though
it
is
likely
enough
as
several
writers
have
pointed
out
that
her
reading
experiences
suggested
goddard
school
in
goddard
was
the
mistress
of
a
school
not
of
a
seminary
or
an
establishment
or
anything
which
professed
in
long
sentences
of
refined
nonsense
to
combine
liberal
acquirements
with
elegant
morality
upon
new
principles
and
new
systems
and
where
young
ladies
for
enormous
pay
might
be
screwed
out
of
health
and
into
vanity
but
a
real
honest
where
a
reasonable
quantity
of
accomplishments
were
sold
at
a
reasonable
price
and
where
girls
might
be
sent
to
be
out
of
the
way
and
scramble
themselves
into
a
little
education
without
any
danger
of
coming
back
prodigies
goddard
school
was
in
high
repute
she
had
an
ample
house
and
garden
gave
the
children
plenty
of
wholesome
food
let
them
run
about
a
great
deal
in
the
summer
and
in
winter
dressed
their
chilblains
with
her
own
hands
it
was
no
wonder
that
a
train
of
twenty
young
couples
now
walked
after
her
to
church
she
was
a
plain
motherly
kind
of
woman
jane
herself
finished
her
schooling
at
the
early
age
of
nine
the
rest
of
her
education
was
completed
at
home
probably
her
father
taught
her
in
his
leisure
hours
and
james
when
he
was
at
home
gave
her
many
useful
hints
father
mother
and
eldest
brother
were
all
fully
capable
of
helping
her
and
perhaps
even
cassandra
did
her
share
but
for
the
most
part
her
culture
must
have
been
such
as
she
herself
imagined
in
the
case
of
elizabeth
bennet
later
on
the
french
of
reading
abbey
school
was
corrected
and
fortified
by
the
lessons
of
her
cousin
eliza
on
the
whole
she
grew
up
with
a
good
stock
of
such
accomplishments
as
might
be
expected
of
a
girl
bred
in
one
of
the
more
intellectual
of
the
clerical
houses
of
that
day
she
read
french
easily
and
knew
a
little
of
italian
and
she
was
well
read
in
the
english
literature
of
the
eighteenth
century
as
a
child
she
had
strong
political
opinions
especially
on
the
affairs
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
she
was
a
vehement
defender
of
charles
i
and
his
grandmother
mary
and
did
not
disdain
to
make
annotations
in
this
sense
which
still
exist
on
the
margin
of
her
goldsmith
as
she
grew
up
the
party
politics
of
the
day
seem
to
have
occupied
very
little
of
her
attention
but
she
probably
shared
the
feeling
of
moderate
toryism
which
prevailed
in
her
family
politics
in
their
larger
aspect
revolution
and
war
were
of
course
very
real
at
that
date
to
every
patriotic
citizen
and
came
home
with
especial
force
to
the
austens
whose
cousin
husband
perished
by
the
guillotine
and
whose
brothers
were
constantly
fighting
on
the
sea
in
her
last
published
sentence
at
the
end
of
the
author
tells
us
how
her
anne
elliot
in
being
the
wife
of
a
sailor
and
no
doubt
she
had
a
similar
feeling
with
regard
to
her
two
naval
brothers
but
there
was
then
no
daily
authentic
intelligence
of
events
as
they
occurred
newspapers
were
a
luxury
of
the
rich
in
those
days
and
it
need
excite
no
surprise
to
find
that
the
events
are
very
seldom
mentioned
in
jane
surviving
letters
we
can
be
in
no
doubt
as
to
her
fervent
and
rather
exclusive
love
for
her
own
country
writing
to
an
old
friend
within
a
few
months
of
her
own
death
she
says
hope
your
letters
from
abroad
are
satisfactory
they
would
not
be
satisfactory
to
i
confess
unless
they
breathed
a
strong
spirit
of
regret
for
not
being
in
england
of
her
favourite
authors
and
favourite
pursuits
we
will
speak
later
footnotes
charles
austen
failed
to
do
so
in
january
see
the
description
of
steventon
is
taken
almost
entirely
from
the
pp
this
was
written
nearly
half
a
century
ago
before
the
revival
of
mixed
gardens
her
daughters
seem
to
have
looked
upon
this
publicity
of
useful
needlework
with
some
suspicion
see
letter
from
lyme
september
these
letters
hitherto
unpublished
are
inserted
by
the
kind
permission
of
nicholson
of
castlefield
house
sturton
by
scawby
lincolnshire
son
of
and
walter
and
times
of
edited
by
harvey
darton
of
a
vol
by
frances
ann
kemble
london
there
are
we
think
but
two
references
to
school
in
her
surviving
correspondence
namely
in
a
letter
to
cassandra
dated
september
where
she
remarks
of
her
sister
letter
could
die
of
laughter
at
it
as
they
used
to
say
at
school
and
in
another
dated
may
where
she
describes
a
room
at
a
school
as
being
in
the
same
novel
henrietta
and
louisa
musgrove
have
brought
back
usual
stock
of
accomplishments
from
a
school
at
exeter
see
next
chapter
it
was
no
uncommon
occurrence
for
the
richer
folk
to
hand
on
their
newspaper
to
their
neighbours
thus
we
find
the
austens
while
at
steventon
apparently
getting
theirs
from
holder
at
ashe
and
later
getting
pinckard
paper
at
lyme
much
in
the
same
way
sir
john
middleton
in
and
would
not
be
denied
the
satisfaction
of
sending
the
dashwoods
his
newspaper
every
day
chapter
iii
warren
hastings
and
the
hancocks
the
title
of
this
chapter
may
seem
at
first
sight
to
remove
it
far
from
the
life
of
jane
austen
but
hancock
who
had
been
philadelphia
austen
was
her
aunt
and
eliza
hancock
not
only
a
cousin
but
also
a
close
friend
and
both
were
always
welcome
visitors
at
steventon
the
varying
fortunes
of
these
ladies
would
therefore
be
an
object
of
constant
thought
and
discussion
at
the
rectory
and
jane
had
an
early
opportunity
of
becoming
interested
in
the
affairs
both
of
india
and
of
france
how
the
acquaintance
of
the
family
with
warren
hastings
began
we
can
not
exactly
say
but
it
certainly
lasted
long
and
resulted
on
their
side
in
an
admiration
for
his
genius
and
his
kindness
and
a
readiness
to
defend
him
when
he
was
attacked
in
one
of
jane
early
unpublished
sketches
occurs
the
following
passage
the
eldest
daughter
had
been
obliged
to
accept
the
offer
of
one
of
her
cousins
to
equip
her
for
the
east
indies
and
tho
infinitely
against
her
inclinations
had
been
necessitated
to
embrace
the
only
possibility
that
was
offered
to
her
of
a
maintenance
yet
it
was
one
so
opposite
to
all
her
ideas
of
propriety
so
contrary
to
her
wishes
so
repugnant
to
her
feelings
that
she
would
almost
have
preferred
servitude
to
it
had
choice
been
allowed
her
her
personal
attractions
had
gained
her
a
husband
as
soon
as
she
had
arrived
at
bengal
and
she
had
now
been
married
nearly
a
twelvemonth
splendidly
yet
unhappily
married
united
to
a
man
of
double
her
own
age
whose
disposition
was
not
amiable
and
whose
manners
were
unpleasing
though
his
character
was
respectable
when
jane
wrote
this
she
may
have
been
thinking
of
her
father
sister
philadelphia
whose
fate
is
described
not
very
incorrectly
though
with
a
certain
amount
of
exaggeration
in
this
passage
that
philadelphia
austen
went
to
seek
her
fortune
in
india
is
certain
and
that
she
did
so
reluctantly
is
extremely
likely
she
had
at
an
early
age
been
left
an
orphan
without
means
or
prospects
and
the
friends
who
brought
her
up
may
have
settled
the
matter
for
her
who
those
friends
were
we
do
not
know
but
from
the
intimate
terms
on
which
she
continued
through
life
not
only
with
her
brother
george
austen
but
also
in
a
less
degree
with
her
william
walter
it
is
probable
that
she
had
spent
much
of
her
youth
with
her
mother
family
her
brother
george
however
as
a
young
man
was
poor
and
had
no
home
to
offer
her
but
the
banishment
which
threatened
entirely
to
separate
the
brother
and
sister
proved
in
the
end
to
have
a
contrary
effect
philadelphia
did
in
time
come
back
to
england
as
a
wife
and
as
the
mother
of
one
daughter
and
her
husband
subsequent
return
to
india
caused
her
to
depend
much
for
companionship
upon
her
english
relations
at
steventon
little
betsy
would
find
playfellows
somewhat
younger
than
herself
in
the
elder
austen
children
while
her
mother
was
discussing
the
last
news
from
india
with
the
heads
of
the
family
our
first
definite
information
about
philadelphia
is
that
in
november
she
petitioned
the
court
of
east
india
directors
for
leave
to
go
to
friends
at
fort
david
by
the
but
who
these
friends
were
or
what
induced
her
to
take
so
adventurous
a
journey
in
search
of
them
we
can
not
say
her
sureties
were
also
sureties
for
a
certain
mary
elliott
so
they
may
have
been
friends
intending
to
travel
together
but
according
to
sydney
grier
conjecture
mary
elliott
did
not
after
all
sail
in
the
but
remained
behind
to
marry
a
certain
captain
buchanan
sailing
with
him
to
india
the
following
year
captain
buchanan
lost
his
life
in
the
black
hole
and
his
widow
whether
she
was
mary
elliott
or
not
married
warren
hastings
by
her
second
husband
she
had
two
children
a
son
george
born
about
and
a
daughter
born
about
who
lived
only
three
weeks
the
short
history
of
the
boy
we
have
already
told
hastings
died
on
july
at
cossinbazar
philadelphia
reached
madras
on
august
it
is
probable
that
in
those
days
no
girl
was
long
in
india
without
receiving
offers
of
marriage
in
fact
hancock
writing
twenty
years
later
to
deprecate
his
daughter
coming
out
to
india
says
to
philadelphia
know
very
well
that
no
girl
tho
but
fourteen
years
old
can
arrive
in
india
without
attracting
the
notice
of
every
coxcomb
in
the
place
you
yourself
know
how
impossible
it
is
for
a
young
girl
to
avoid
being
attached
to
a
young
handsome
man
whose
address
is
agreeable
to
her
if
there
any
handsome
young
man
in
philadelphia
case
it
was
probably
not
hancock
who
must
have
been
forty
or
more
when
he
married
her
at
cuddalore
on
february
the
name
of
tysoe
saul
hancock
appears
in
the
list
of
european
inhabitants
at
fort
david
for
as
surgeon
at
per
annum
and
at
fort
david
he
and
philadelphia
remained
for
three
years
after
their
marriage
where
the
hancocks
were
during
the
troublous
times
which
began
in
is
not
known
but
by
the
beginning
of
they
were
certainly
in
calcutta
for
their
daughter
elizabeth
better
known
as
betsy
was
born
there
in
december
warren
hastings
at
this
time
resident
at
murshidabad
was
godfather
to
elizabeth
who
received
the
name
he
had
intended
to
give
to
his
own
infant
daughter
the
origin
of
the
close
intimacy
that
existed
between
the
hancocks
and
warren
hastings
is
uncertain
but
if
mary
elliott
really
became
the
wife
of
the
latter
the
friendship
of
the
two
women
may
perhaps
explain
the
great
obligation
under
which
hastings
describes
himself
as
being
to
philadelphia
the
news
of
the
death
of
his
little
son
was
the
first
thing
hastings
heard
on
landing
in
england
in
and
we
are
told
it
left
a
shadow
on
his
face
for
years
he
seems
always
to
have
been
especially
fond
of
children
and
his
intimate
friends
knew
they
could
give
no
greater
pleasure
than
by
informing
him
of
the
welfare
of
his
favourites
or
by
sending
messages
to
them
thus
marriott
writing
to
hastings
from
india
on
august
sends
his
kisses
and
salaam
to
i
believe
i
should
say
betsy
hancock
and
a
hearty
shake
by
the
hand
to
george
i
suppose
if
i
were
to
go
to
kiss
him
he
would
give
me
a
box
on
the
write
me
particularly
how
these
little
ones
go
it
seems
likely
that
the
hancocks
sailed
with
warren
hastings
for
england
in
the
in
but
whenever
they
went
we
learn
from
hancock
letters
that
the
journey
home
cost
them
the
large
sum
of
he
hancock
no
doubt
thought
that
he
had
amassed
a
sufficient
fortune
perhaps
from
trading
or
from
private
practice
for
it
can
hardly
have
been
from
his
official
income
in
india
to
enable
him
to
end
his
days
comfortably
at
home
but
either
his
indian
investments
turned
out
badly
or
he
discovered
that
living
in
good
style
in
england
cost
much
more
than
he
had
anticipated
and
after
three
years
he
found
himself
under
the
disagreeable
necessity
of
a
second
residence
in
bengal
in
order
to
secure
a
fresh
provision
for
his
wife
and
daughter
so
low
indeed
were
his
finances
at
the
time
that
he
was
forced
to
borrow
money
from
hastings
to
pay
for
his
passage
out
he
reached
calcutta
in
but
did
not
prosper
on
this
second
visit
his
health
was
bad
his
trading
ventures
turned
out
amiss
and
there
were
perpetual
difficulties
about
remitting
money
home
to
philadelphia
hastings
evidently
foresaw
how
matters
would
end
and
with
his
wonted
generosity
gave
a
sum
amounting
at
first
to
and
increased
later
to
in
trust
for
hancock
and
his
wife
during
their
lives
and
on
the
death
of
the
survivor
to
betsy
hancock
himself
died
in
november
beloved
and
deeply
regretted
in
the
words
of
a
young
man
whom
he
had
befriended
patron
of
the
widow
and
the
fatherless
he
seems
indeed
to
have
been
a
man
of
affectionate
and
anxious
disposition
strongly
attached
to
his
wife
and
daughter
but
the
last
part
of
his
life
was
passed
away
from
them
amid
difficulties
and
disappointments
and
his
spirits
were
hardly
high
enough
to
enable
him
to
bear
up
against
unequal
fortune
he
alludes
in
his
letters
with
expressions
of
regard
to
his
george
austen
but
characteristically
deplores
his
growing
family
thinking
that
he
will
not
be
able
to
put
them
out
in
the
world
a
difficulty
which
did
not
eventually
prove
to
be
insuperable
when
the
news
of
his
death
reached
england
which
would
be
in
about
six
months
time
george
austen
and
his
wife
were
fortunately
present
to
comfort
philadelphia
under
the
sad
tidings
she
and
betsy
had
now
been
living
in
england
for
ten
years
and
had
seen
no
doubt
much
of
the
steventon
austens
warren
hastings
loyal
attachment
to
the
widow
and
daughter
of
his
friend
remained
unchanged
and
they
lived
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
his
woodman
and
his
family
as
long
as
hancock
lived
he
wrote
constantly
to
wife
and
child
and
gave
advice
occasionally
perhaps
of
a
rather
embarrassing
kind
about
the
education
of
the
latter
he
discouraged
however
an
idea
of
his
that
she
should
bring
betsy
out
to
india
at
the
age
of
twelve
at
last
hancock
who
though
a
really
good
woman
was
to
her
daughter
was
able
to
fulfil
the
chief
desire
of
her
own
heart
and
to
take
her
abroad
to
finish
her
studies
and
later
to
seek
an
entry
into
the
great
world
in
paris
her
husband
affairs
had
been
left
in
much
confusion
but
hastings
generous
gift
of
put
them
above
want
betsy
or
rather
what
young
woman
of
common
gentility
as
we
read
in
reach
the
age
of
sixteen
without
altering
her
name
as
far
as
she
can
was
just
grown
up
when
this
great
move
was
made
in
years
to
come
her
connexion
with
her
steventon
cousins
was
destined
to
be
a
close
one
at
the
present
time
she
was
a
very
pretty
lively
girl
fond
of
amusements
and
perhaps
estimating
her
own
importance
a
little
too
highly
but
she
had
been
carefully
educated
and
was
capable
of
disinterested
attachments
she
seems
to
have
had
a
special
love
for
her
uncle
george
austen
and
one
of
her
earliest
letters
from
paris
written
may
announces
that
she
is
sending
to
him
her
picture
in
miniature
adding
is
reckoned
like
what
i
am
at
present
the
dress
is
quite
the
present
fashion
of
what
i
usually
wear
this
miniature
is
still
in
existence
and
represents
a
charming
fresh
young
girl
in
a
low
white
dress
edged
with
light
blue
ribbon
the
hair
turned
up
and
powdered
with
a
ribbon
of
the
same
colour
passed
through
it
our
knowledge
of
her
character
at
this
time
is
principally
derived
from
a
series
of
letters
written
by
her
to
her
cousin
phila
walter
letters
singularly
frank
and
gossipy
and
of
especial
interest
to
us
from
the
sidelights
they
throw
on
the
family
circle
at
steventon
there
are
also
interesting
letters
from
phila
to
her
own
family
such
a
girl
as
eliza
was
not
likely
to
pass
unnoticed
in
any
society
and
in
august
woodman
writes
to
tell
warren
hastings
that
she
is
on
the
point
of
marriage
with
a
french
officer
and
that
austen
is
much
concerned
at
the
connexion
which
he
says
is
giving
up
all
their
friends
their
country
and
he
fears
their
religion
the
intended
husband
was
jean
capotte
comte
de
feuillide
aged
thirty
an
officer
in
the
queen
regiment
of
dragoons
and
owner
of
an
estate
called
le
marais
near
gaboret
in
guyenne
the
marriage
took
place
in
the
same
year
and
in
the
following
march
eliza
now
comtesse
de
feuillide
writes
phila
a
long
letter
praising
the
comte
and
his
devotion
to
herself
the
man
to
whom
i
have
given
my
hand
is
everyways
amiable
both
in
mind
and
person
it
is
too
little
to
say
he
loves
me
since
he
literally
adores
me
entirely
devoted
to
me
and
making
my
inclinations
the
guide
of
all
his
actions
the
whole
study
of
his
life
seems
to
be
to
contribute
to
the
happiness
of
mine
my
situation
is
everyways
agreeable
certain
of
never
being
separated
from
my
dear
mama
whose
presence
enhances
every
other
blessing
i
enjoy
equally
sure
of
my
affection
mistress
of
an
easy
fortune
with
the
prospect
of
a
very
ample
one
add
to
these
the
advantages
of
rank
and
title
and
a
numerous
and
brilliant
acquaintance
amongst
whom
i
can
flatter
myself
i
have
some
sincere
friends
and
you
will
unite
with
me
in
saying
i
have
reason
to
be
thankful
to
providence
for
the
lot
fallen
to
my
share
the
only
thing
which
can
make
me
uneasy
is
the
distance
i
am
from
my
relations
and
country
but
this
is
what
i
trust
i
shall
not
always
have
to
complain
of
as
the
comte
has
the
greatest
desire
to
see
england
and
even
to
make
it
his
residence
a
part
of
the
year
we
shall
certainly
make
you
a
visit
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
peace
takes
place
in
the
same
letter
she
mentions
how
gay
the
season
has
been
on
account
of
the
birth
of
the
dauphin
and
of
the
fêtes
which
accompanied
that
event
neither
she
nor
her
and
brilliant
acquaintance
had
any
prevision
of
the
terrible
days
that
awaited
all
their
order
nor
any
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
the
irresistible
forces
which
were
soon
to
overwhelm
them
and
to
put
a
tragical
end
to
every
hope
cherished
by
the
bride
except
that
of
rejoining
her
english
friends
for
the
present
she
led
a
life
of
pleasure
and
gaiety
but
that
it
did
not
make
her
forgetful
of
steventon
is
shown
by
another
letter
to
phila
dated
may
i
experienced
much
pleasure
from
the
account
you
gave
me
of
my
uncle
geo
austen
family
each
of
my
cousins
seems
to
be
everything
their
parents
could
wish
them
such
intelligence
would
have
given
me
the
completest
satisfaction
had
it
not
been
accompanied
by
the
melancholy
news
of
the
death
of
the
valuable
cooper
i
sincerely
lament
her
loss
and
sympathize
with
the
grief
it
must
have
occasioned
both
mama
and
myself
were
very
apprehensive
of
the
influence
of
this
event
on
my
aunt
health
but
fortunately
the
last
accounts
from
steventon
assure
us
that
the
whole
family
continue
well
on
january
she
again
writes
on
the
subject
of
a
visit
to
england
about
which
she
hesitates
partly
because
of
the
state
of
her
health
and
partly
because
she
was
expecting
a
long
visit
from
her
cousin
james
austen
eldest
son
of
george
austen
a
young
man
who
having
completed
his
undergraduate
residence
at
oxford
was
spending
some
months
in
france
to
england
however
she
came
hoping
to
see
much
of
the
austen
family
mean
she
writes
spend
a
very
few
days
in
london
and
if
my
health
allows
me
immediately
to
pay
a
visit
to
steventon
because
my
uncle
informs
us
that
midsummer
and
christmas
are
the
only
seasons
when
his
mansion
is
sufficiently
at
liberty
to
admit
of
his
receiving
his
friends
the
rectory
was
certainly
too
small
a
to
contain
the
comtesse
and
her
mother
in
addition
to
its
own
large
family
party
and
various
pupils
so
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
eliza
carried
out
her
project
in
june
before
she
was
otherwise
engaged
she
settled
for
a
time
in
london
at
orchard
street
and
there
it
must
be
supposed
her
one
child
a
little
boy
was
born
in
the
autumn
to
be
named
hastings
after
her
own
godfather
the
comte
who
was
himself
detained
by
business
in
france
had
for
some
unexplained
reason
desired
that
their
child
might
be
born
in
england
whether
she
went
again
to
steventon
at
christmas
is
uncertain
for
her
next
letter
is
dated
april
eliza
was
then
in
town
and
expecting
a
visit
from
her
cousin
henry
austen
by
this
time
a
youth
of
sixteen
about
to
go
into
residence
at
oxford
she
had
been
indulging
in
such
gaieties
as
london
had
to
offer
her
as
to
me
i
have
been
for
some
time
past
the
greatest
rake
imaginable
and
really
wonder
how
such
a
meagre
creature
as
i
am
can
support
so
much
fatigue
of
which
the
history
of
one
day
will
give
you
some
idea
for
i
only
stood
from
two
to
four
in
the
and
of
course
loaded
with
a
great
hoop
of
no
inconsiderable
weight
went
to
the
duchess
of
cumberland
in
the
evening
and
from
thence
to
almack
where
i
staid
till
five
in
the
morning
all
this
i
did
not
many
days
ago
and
am
yet
alive
to
tell
you
of
it
i
believe
tho
i
should
not
be
able
to
support
london
hours
and
all
the
racketing
of
a
london
life
for
a
year
together
you
are
very
good
in
your
enquiries
after
my
little
boy
who
is
in
perfect
health
but
has
got
no
teeth
yet
which
somewhat
mortifies
his
two
mamas
eliza
domestic
cares
and
her
gaieties
must
still
have
left
her
some
time
to
think
with
anxiety
and
apprehension
of
the
impeachment
of
her
godfather
and
benefactor
hastings
we
have
a
glimpse
of
this
in
a
letter
of
phila
walter
who
was
staying
with
her
aunt
and
cousin
in
orchard
street
in
april
they
went
to
the
trial
one
day
sat
from
ten
till
four
completely
tired
but
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
all
the
celebrated
orators
sheridan
burke
and
fox
the
first
was
so
low
we
could
not
hear
him
the
second
so
hot
and
hasty
we
could
not
understand
the
third
was
highly
superior
to
either
as
we
could
distinguish
every
word
but
not
to
our
satisfaction
as
he
is
so
much
against
hastings
whom
we
all
wish
so
well
in
august
eliza
writes
what
has
contributed
to
hurry
me
and
take
up
my
time
is
my
having
been
obliged
to
pay
some
visits
out
of
town
we
spent
a
little
time
at
beaumont
lodge
and
i
am
but
just
returned
from
an
excursion
into
berkshire
during
which
we
made
some
little
stay
at
oxford
my
cousin
met
us
there
and
as
well
as
his
brother
was
so
good
as
to
take
the
trouble
of
shewing
us
the
lions
we
visited
several
of
the
colleges
the
museum
and
were
very
elegantly
entertained
by
our
gallant
relations
at
john
where
i
was
mightily
taken
with
the
garden
and
longed
to
be
a
that
i
might
walk
in
it
every
day
besides
i
was
delighted
with
the
black
gown
and
thought
the
square
cap
mighty
becoming
i
do
not
think
you
would
know
henry
with
his
hair
powdered
in
a
very
style
besides
he
is
at
present
taller
than
his
father
you
mention
the
troubles
in
france
but
you
will
easily
imagine
from
what
i
have
said
concerning
my
approaching
journey
that
things
are
in
a
quieter
state
than
they
were
some
months
ago
had
they
continued
as
they
were
it
is
most
probable
de
would
have
been
called
out
and
it
would
have
been
a
very
unpleasant
kind
of
duty
because
he
must
have
borne
arms
against
his
own
countrymen
we
hear
but
little
of
eliza
during
the
next
two
or
three
years
which
she
seems
to
have
spent
partly
in
france
partly
in
england
she
must
have
been
much
engrossed
by
the
stirring
events
in
paris
the
result
of
which
was
eventually
to
prove
fatal
to
her
husband
in
january
she
is
at
margate
for
the
benefit
of
her
boy
and
though
the
place
is
very
empty
occupies
herself
with
reading
music
drawing
she
adds
de
had
given
me
hopes
of
his
return
to
england
this
winter
but
the
turn
which
the
affairs
of
france
have
taken
will
not
allow
him
to
quit
the
continent
at
this
juncture
i
know
not
whether
i
have
already
mentioned
it
to
you
but
my
who
is
a
strong
or
royalist
in
his
heart
has
joined
this
latter
party
who
have
taken
refuge
in
piedmont
and
is
now
at
turin
where
the
french
princes
of
the
blood
are
assembled
and
watching
some
favourable
opportunity
to
reinstate
themselves
in
the
country
they
have
quitted
i
am
no
politician
but
think
they
will
not
easily
accomplish
their
purpose
time
alone
can
decide
this
matter
and
in
the
interim
you
will
easily
imagine
i
can
not
be
wholly
unconcerned
about
events
which
must
inevitably
in
some
degree
influence
my
future
destiny
eliza
had
another
terrible
anxiety
in
june
in
the
failure
of
her
mother
health
in
september
she
is
hoping
for
a
visit
from
her
husband
when
if
her
mother
health
allows
they
will
all
go
to
bath
a
journey
from
which
i
promise
myself
much
pleasure
as
i
have
a
notion
it
is
a
place
quite
after
my
own
heart
however
the
accomplishment
of
this
plan
is
very
uncertain
as
from
the
present
appearance
of
things
france
will
probably
be
engaged
in
a
war
which
will
not
admit
of
an
officer
whose
services
will
certainly
be
required
quitting
his
country
at
such
a
period
my
mother
has
this
very
morning
received
a
letter
from
steventon
where
they
all
enjoy
perfect
health
the
youngest
boy
charles
is
gone
to
the
naval
academy
at
portsmouth
as
to
the
young
ladies
i
hear
they
are
perfect
beauties
and
of
course
gain
hearts
by
dozens
in
november
she
says
edward
i
believe
will
in
another
month
or
two
take
unto
himself
a
spouse
he
shewed
me
the
lady
picture
which
is
that
of
a
very
pretty
woman
as
to
cassandra
it
is
very
probable
as
you
observe
that
some
son
of
neptune
may
have
obtained
her
approbation
as
she
probably
experienced
much
homage
from
these
gallant
gentlemen
during
her
acquatic
excursions
i
hear
her
sister
and
herself
are
two
of
the
prettiest
girls
in
england
hancock
died
in
the
winter
of
and
our
next
letter
from
eliza
is
not
till
june
in
the
interval
she
had
been
together
with
de
feuillide
who
had
perhaps
come
over
to
attend
the
of
philadelphia
to
bath
from
which
place
she
had
derived
little
amusement
owing
to
the
state
of
her
spirits
returning
to
london
de
feuillide
had
hoped
to
stay
there
some
time
but
he
soon
received
accounts
from
france
which
informed
him
that
having
already
exceeded
his
leave
of
absence
if
he
still
continued
in
england
he
would
be
considered
as
one
of
the
emigrants
and
consequently
his
whole
property
forfeited
to
the
nation
such
advices
were
not
to
be
neglected
and
de
was
obliged
to
depart
for
paris
but
not
however
without
giving
me
hopes
of
his
return
in
some
months
that
is
to
say
when
the
state
of
affairs
would
let
him
for
at
present
it
is
a
very
difficult
business
for
a
military
man
especially
to
obtain
leave
to
absent
himself
on
september
she
writes
i
can
readily
believe
that
the
share
of
sensibility
i
know
you
to
be
possessed
of
would
not
suffer
you
to
learn
the
tragical
events
of
which
france
has
of
late
been
the
theatre
without
being
much
affected
my
private
letters
confirm
the
intelligence
afforded
by
the
public
prints
and
assure
me
that
nothing
we
there
read
is
exaggerated
de
is
at
present
in
paris
he
had
determined
on
coming
to
england
but
finds
it
impossible
to
get
away
the
crisis
of
her
husband
fate
was
not
far
distant
how
the
tragedy
was
led
up
to
by
the
events
of
we
do
not
know
but
in
february
he
was
arrested
on
the
charge
of
suborning
witnesses
in
favour
of
the
marquise
de
marboeuf
the
marquise
had
been
accused
of
conspiring
against
the
republic
in
one
of
the
chief
counts
against
her
being
that
she
had
laid
down
certain
arable
land
on
her
estate
at
champs
near
meaux
in
lucerne
sainfoin
and
clover
with
the
object
of
producing
a
famine
the
marquise
by
way
of
defence
printed
a
memorial
of
her
case
stating
among
other
things
that
she
had
not
done
what
she
was
accused
of
doing
and
further
that
if
she
had
she
had
a
perfect
right
to
do
what
she
liked
with
her
own
property
but
it
was
evident
that
things
were
likely
to
go
hard
with
the
marquise
at
her
trial
the
comte
de
feuillide
then
came
upon
the
scene
and
attempted
to
bribe
morel
one
of
the
secretaries
of
the
committee
of
safety
to
suppress
incriminating
documents
and
even
to
bear
witness
in
her
favour
morel
drew
the
count
on
and
then
betrayed
him
the
marquise
her
agent
and
the
count
were
all
condemned
to
death
and
the
count
suffered
the
penalty
on
february
we
can
not
tell
where
eliza
was
through
this
trying
time
the
tradition
in
the
family
is
that
she
escaped
through
dangers
and
difficulties
to
england
and
found
a
refuge
at
steventon
but
we
have
no
positive
information
of
her
having
returned
to
france
at
all
it
is
quite
possible
that
she
was
at
steventon
and
if
so
the
party
must
have
felt
as
though
they
were
brought
very
near
to
the
guillotine
it
was
an
event
to
make
a
lasting
impression
on
a
and
emotional
girl
of
eighteen
and
eliza
remained
so
closely
linked
with
the
family
that
the
tragedy
probably
haunted
jane
memory
for
a
long
time
to
come
footnotes

of
warren

his
introduced

family
life
the
eldest
brother
of
the
family
james
was
nearly
eleven
years
older
than
jane
and
had
taken
his
degree
at
oxford
before
she
left
school
he
had
matriculated
at
john
where
he
obtained
a
scholarship
and
subsequently
a
fellowship
in
at
the
early
age
of
fourteen
his
departure
from
home
having
been
perhaps
hastened
in
order
to
make
room
for
the
three
or
four
pupils
who
were
sharing
his
brothers
studies
at
that
time
his
was
a
scholarly
type
of
mind
he
was
well
read
in
english
literature
had
a
correct
taste
and
wrote
readily
and
happily
both
in
prose
and
verse
his
son
the
author
of
the
believes
that
he
had
a
large
share
in
directing
the
reading
and
forming
the
taste
of
his
sister
jane
james
was
evidently
in
sympathy
with
cowper
return
to
nature
from
the
more
artificial
and
mechanical
style
of
pope
imitators
and
so
was
she
in
and
marianne
after
her
first
conversation
with
willoughby
had
happily
assured
herself
of
his
admiring
pope
more
than
is
proper
in
we
hear
of
james
being
in
france
his
cousin
eliza
was
hoping
for
a
visit
of
some
months
from
him
but
in
the
next
year
he
had
returned
and
he
must
have
soon
gone
into
residence
at
oxford
as
a
young
fellow
of
his
college
for
there
in
he
became
the
originator
and
chief
author
of
a
periodical
paper
called
modelled
on
and
its
successors
it
existed
for
more
than
a
twelvemonth
and
in
the
last
number
the
whole
was
offered
to
the
world
as
a
but
not
entirely
inaccurate
sketch
of
the
character
the
manners
and
the
amusements
of
oxford
at
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
after
life
we
are
told
he
used
to
speak
very
slightingly
of
this
early
work
he
had
the
better
right
to
do
as
whatever
may
have
been
the
degree
of
their
merits
the
best
papers
had
certainly
been
written
by
himself
edward
austen
disposition
and
tastes
were
as
different
from
james
as
his
lot
in
life
proved
to
be
edward
as
his
mother
says
no
pretensions
to
literary
taste
and
scholarship
but
he
was
an
excellent
man
of
business
and
affectionate
and
he
possessed
also
a
spirit
of
fun
and
liveliness
which
made
him
as
time
went
on
especially
delightful
to
all
young
people
his
history
was
more
like
fiction
than
reality
most
children
have
at
some
time
or
other
indulged
in
in
which
they
succeed
to
unexpected
estates
and
consequent
power
and
it
all
happened
to
edward
thomas
knight
of
godmersham
park
in
kent
and
chawton
house
in
hampshire
had
married
a
second
cousin
of
george
austen
and
had
placed
him
in
his
rectory
at
steventon
his
son
another
thomas
knight
and
his
charming
wife
catherine
knatchbull
took
a
fancy
to
young
edward
had
him
often
to
their
house
and
eventually
adopted
him
the
story
remains
in
the
family
of
and
knight
asking
for
the
company
of
young
edward
during
his
holidays
of
his
father
hesitating
in
the
interests
of
the
latin
grammar
and
of
his
mother
clinching
the
matter
by
saying
think
my
dear
you
had
better
oblige
your
cousins
and
let
the
child
go
there
was
no
issue
of
the
marriage
of
and
knight
and
by
degrees
they
made
up
their
minds
to
adopt
edward
austen
as
their
heir
this
resolution
was
not
only
a
mark
of
their
regard
for
edward
but
also
a
compliment
to
the
austen
family
in
general
whose
early
promise
their
cousins
had
probably
observed
the
relationship
not
being
near
enough
to
constitute
any
claim
but
knight
was
most
serious
in
his
intentions
for
in
his
will
he
left
the
estates
in
remainder
to
edward
brothers
in
succession
in
case
of
the
failure
of
his
issue
and
knight
always
showed
the
kindest
interest
in
all
the
family
edward
was
now
more
and
more
at
godmersham
and
less
and
less
at
home
under
the
auspices
he
was
sent
not
to
the
university
but
on
a
tour
which
included
dresden
and
rome
he
was
probably
away
on
this
tour
at
the
date
which
we
have
now
reached
jane
favourite
brother
henry
was
nearly
four
years
younger
than
edward
and
was
no
doubt
still
profiting
by
his
father
instructions
by
he
was
not
only
at
oxford
but
was
contributing
to
a
paper
on
the
sentimental
school
of
rousseau
and
considering
far
the
indulgence
of
the
sentiments
affects
the
immediate
happiness
or
misery
of
human
life
henry
whose
course
in
life
was
marked
by
sharper
curves
than
that
of
any
of
his
brothers
was
no
doubt
a
very
attractive
personality
his
niece
lefroy
says
of
him
he
was
the
handsomest
of
his
family
and
in
the
opinion
of
his
own
father
also
the
most
talented
there
were
others
who
formed
a
different
estimate
and
considered
his
abilities
greater
in
show
than
in
reality
but
for
the
most
part
he
was
greatly
admired
brilliant
in
conversation
he
was
and
like
his
father
blessed
with
a
hopefulness
of
temper
which
in
adapting
itself
to
all
circumstances
even
the
most
adverse
seemed
to
create
a
perpetual
sunshine
the
race
however
is
not
all
to
the
swift
it
never
has
been
and
though
so
highly
gifted
by
nature
my
uncle
was
not
prosperous
in
life
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
by
his
bright
and
lovable
nature
he
contributed
greatly
to
the
happiness
of
his
sister
jane
she
tells
us
that
he
could
not
help
being
amusing
and
she
was
so
good
a
judge
of
that
quality
that
we
accept
her
opinion
of
henry
humour
without
demur
but
he
became
so
grandiloquent
when
wishing
to
be
serious
that
he
certainly
must
have
wanted
that
last
and
rarest
gift
of
a
humorist
the
art
of
laughing
at
himself
very
different
again
was
the
and
steadfast
francis
the
future
admiral
of
the
fleet
who
was
born
in
april
and
divided
in
age
from
henry
by
their
sister
cassandra
he
must
have
spent
some
time
at
home
with
his
sisters
after
their
return
from
school
before
he
entered
the
royal
naval
academy
established
in
at
portsmouth
under
the
supreme
direction
of
the
lords
of
the
admiralty
francis
joined
it
when
he
was
just
twelve
and
attracted
the
particular
notice
of
the
lords
of
the
admiralty
by
the
closeness
of
his
application
and
been
in
consequence
marked
out
for
early
promotion
embarked
two
and
a
half
years
later
as
a
volunteer
on
board
the
frigate
captain
isaac
smith
bound
to
the
east
indies
his
father
on
this
occasion
wrote
him
a
long
letter
of
which
a
great
part
is
given
in
austen
sailor
nothing
in
this
wise
and
kind
letter
is
more
remarkable
than
the
courtesy
and
delicacy
with
which
the
father
addresses
his
advice
to
the
son
who
was
but
a
boy
but
whom
he
treats
as
an
officer
and
as
a
young
man
of
whom
he
already
cherished
the
highest
hopes
consequent
upon
his
previous
good
conduct
he
speaks
on
many
topics
religious
duties
being
given
the
first
place
among
them
he
rejoices
in
the
high
character
francis
had
acquired
in
the
academy
and
assures
him
that
good
mother
brothers
sisters
and
myself
will
all
exult
in
your
reputation
and
rejoice
in
your
happiness
the
letter
concludes
thus
have
nothing
more
to
add
but
my
blessing
and
best
prayers
for
your
health
and
prosperity
and
to
beg
you
would
never
forget
you
have
not
upon
earth
a
more
disinterested
and
warm
friend
than
your
truly
affectionate
father
geo
austen
we
need
not
be
surprised
to
learn
that
this
letter
was
found
among
the
admiral
private
papers
when
he
died
at
the
age
of
the
remaining
brother
charles
his
sisters
particular
little
brother
born
in
must
have
been
still
in
the
nursery
when
his
sisters
left
school
these
brothers
meant
a
great
deal
to
jane
dearest
of
all
to
her
heart
was
her
sister
cassandra
about
three
years
her
senior
their
sisterly
affection
for
each
other
could
scarcely
be
exceeded
perhaps
it
began
on
jane
side
with
the
feeling
of
deference
natural
to
a
loving
child
towards
a
kind
elder
sister
something
of
this
feeling
always
remained
and
even
in
the
maturity
of
her
powers
and
in
the
enjoyment
of
increasing
success
she
would
still
speak
of
cassandra
as
of
one
wiser
and
better
than
herself
attachment
was
never
interrupted
or
weakened
they
lived
in
the
same
home
and
shared
the
same
bedroom
till
separated
by
death
they
were
not
exactly
alike
cassandra
was
the
colder
and
calmer
disposition
she
was
always
prudent
and
but
with
less
outward
demonstration
of
feeling
and
less
sunniness
of
temper
than
jane
possessed
it
was
remarked
in
the
family
that
cassandra
had
the
of
having
her
temper
always
under
command
but
that
jane
had
the
of
a
temper
which
never
required
to
be
commanded
such
was
the
family
party
at
steventon
and
was
so
much
that
was
agreeable
in
it
that
its
members
may
be
excused
if
they
were
inclined
to
live
somewhat
too
exclusively
within
it
they
might
see
in
each
other
much
to
love
and
esteem
and
something
to
admire
the
family
talk
had
abundance
of
spirit
and
vivacity
and
was
never
troubled
by
disagreements
even
in
little
matters
for
it
was
not
their
habit
to
dispute
or
argue
with
each
other
above
all
there
was
strong
family
affection
and
firm
union
never
to
be
broken
but
by
death
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
all
this
had
its
influence
with
the
author
in
the
construction
of
her
stories
in
which
family
life
often
plays
a
large
part
the
party
which
we
have
described
was
for
many
years
by
death
and
seldom
visited
by
sorrow
their
situation
had
some
peculiar
advantages
beyond
those
of
ordinary
rectories
steventon
was
a
family
living
knight
the
patron
was
also
proprietor
of
nearly
the
whole
parish
he
never
resided
there
and
consequently
the
rector
and
his
children
came
to
be
regarded
in
the
neighbourhood
as
representatives
of
the
family
they
shared
with
the
principal
tenant
the
command
of
an
excellent
manor
and
enjoyed
in
this
reflected
way
some
of
the
consideration
usually
awarded
to
landed
proprietors
they
were
not
rich
but
aided
by
austen
power
of
teaching
they
had
enough
to
afford
a
good
education
to
their
sons
and
daughters
to
mix
in
the
best
society
of
the
neighbourhood
and
to
exercise
a
liberal
hospitality
to
their
own
relations
and
friends
carriage
and
pair
of
horses
were
kept
but
this
could
be
done
more
cheaply
in
the
eighteenth
century
than
in
the
nineteenth
were
then
no
assessed
taxes
the
carriage
once
bought
entailed
little
further
expense
and
the
horses
probably
like
bennet
in
and
were
often
employed
on
farm
work
moreover
it
should
be
remembered
that
a
pair
of
horses
in
those
days
were
almost
a
necessity
if
ladies
were
to
move
about
at
all
for
neither
the
condition
of
the
roads
nor
the
style
of
admitted
of
any
comfortable
vehicle
being
drawn
by
a
single
horse
indeed
the
object
of
the
builders
seems
to
have
been
combine
the
greatest
possible
weight
with
the
least
possible
amount
of
accommodation
jane
austen
lost
no
time
in
entering
on
the
career
of
authorship
she
wrote
because
she
must
and
with
very
little
prevision
of
the
path
which
her
genius
was
afterwards
to
mark
out
for
her
she
was
urged
onward
the
first
stirrings
of
talent
within
her
and
the
absorbing
interest
of
early
composition
is
impossible
to
say
at
how
early
an
age
she
began
there
are
extant
containing
tales
some
of
which
must
have
been
composed
while
she
was
a
young
girl
as
they
had
amounted
to
a
considerable
number
by
the
time
she
was
sixteen
her
earliest
stories
are
of
a
slight
and
flimsy
texture
and
are
generally
intended
to
be
nonsensical
but
the
nonsense
has
much
spirit
in
it
they
are
usually
preceded
by
a
dedication
of
mock
solemnity
to
some
one
of
her
family
it
would
seem
that
the
grandiloquent
dedications
prevalent
in
those
days
had
not
escaped
her
youthful
penetration
perhaps
the
most
characteristic
feature
in
those
early
productions
is
that
however
puerile
the
matter
they
are
always
composed
in
pure
simple
english
quite
free
from
the
style
which
might
be
expected
from
so
young
a
writer

him
and
of

a
somewhat
later

pure
extravaganza
called
is
dedicated
by
permission
to
miss

lloyd
the
manuscript
volume
which
contains
is
grandly
entitled
on
the
outside

third
on
the
inside
of

by
a
very
young

of
tales
in

style
entirely
new

other
tale
unfinished
but
of
considerable
length
called
or
the
which
is
preceded
by
the
following
dedication
dated
august
to
miss
austen
madam
encouraged
by
your
warm
patronage
of
beautiful
and
history
of
which
through
your
generous
support
have
obtained
a
place
in
every
library
in
the
kingdom
and
run
through
four
score
editions
i
take
the
liberty
of
begging
the
same
exertions
in
favour
of
the
following
novel
which
i
humbly
flatter
myself
possesses
merit
beyond
any
already
published
or
any
that
will
ever
in
future
appear
except
such
as
may
proceed
from
the
pen
of
your
most
grateful
humble
servant
the
author
the
tale
begins
in
characteristic
style
which
suggests
the
later
catharine
had
the
misfortune
as
many
heroines
have
had
before
her
of
losing
her
parents
when
she
was
very
young
and
of
being
brought
up
under
the
care
of
a
maiden
aunt
who
while
she
tenderly
loved
her
watched
her
conduct
with
so
scrutinizing
a
severity
as
to
make
it
very
doubtful
to
many
people
and
to
catharine
among
the
rest
whether
she
loved
her
or
not
catharine
lives
with
this
aunt
in
devonshire
five
miles
from
exeter
some
friends
of
her
aunt
a
stanley
his
wife
and
daughter
very
foolish
and
suggestive
of
isabella
thorpe
come
to
visit
them
stanley
son
turns
up
unexpectedly
and
pays
great
attention
to
catharine
much
to
the
disgust
of
the
aunt
who
has
a
detestation
of
all
young
men
the
tale
comes
to
an
abrupt
conclusion
with
the
departure
of
the
guests
the
story
is
at
times
amusing
but
obviously
immature
and
we
need
not
regret
that
it
was
never
finished
other
early
sketches
are
and
dedicated
to
miss
cooper
which
must
have
been
written
before
the
latter
marriage
at
the
end
of
dedicated
to
the
rev
james
austen
and
and
of
dedicated
to
francis
william
austen
midshipman
on
board
soon
after
and
other
pieces
dedicated
to
charles
john
austen
esq
and
seem
to
mark
a
second
stage
in
her
literary
education
when
she
was
hesitating
between
burlesque
and
immature
and
when
indeed
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
first
taking
note
of
all
the
faults
to
be
avoided
and
curiously
considering
how
she
ought
to
write
before
she
attempted
to
put
forth
her
strength
in
the
right
direction
own
mature
opinion
of
the
desirableness
of
such
an
early
habit
of
composition
is
given
in
the
following
words
of
a
niece
as
i
grew
older
my
aunt
would
talk
to
me
more
seriously
of
my
reading
and
my
amusements
i
had
taken
early
to
writing
verses
and
stories
and
i
am
sorry
to
think
how
i
troubled
her
with
reading
them
she
was
very
kind
about
it
and
always
had
some
praise
to
bestow
but
at
last
she
warned
me
against
spending
too
much
time
upon
them
she
said
how
well
i
recollect
it
that
she
knew
writing
stories
was
a
great
amusement
and
thought
a
harmless
one
though
many
people
she
was
aware
thought
otherwise
but
that
at
my
age
it
would
be
bad
for
me
to
be
much
taken
up
with
my
own
compositions
later
still
it
was
after
she
had
gone
to
winchester
she
sent
me
a
message
to
this
effect
that
if
i
would
take
her
advice
i
should
cease
writing
till
i
was
sixteen
that
she
had
herself
often
wished
she
had
read
more
and
written
less
in
the
corresponding
years
of
her
own
life
this
niece
was
only
twelve
years
old
at
the
time
of
her
death
these
words
seem
to
imply
that
the
juvenile
tales
which
we
have
mentioned
had
some
of
them
at
least
been
written
in
her
childhood
while
others
were
separated
only
by
a
very
few
years
from
the
period
which
included
specimens
of
her
most
brilliant
writing
in
the
summer
of
when
the
girls
were
fifteen
and
twelve
respectively
they
accompanied
their
parents
on
a
visit
to
their
old
francis
austen
at
sevenoaks
though
jane
had
been
to
oxford
southampton
and
reading
before
it
is
probable
that
this
was
her
first
visit
into
kent
and
what
must
have
been
more
interesting
still
her
first
visit
to
london
we
have
no
clue
as
to
where
the
party
stayed
in
town
but
one
of
eliza
de
feuillide
letters
to
philadelphia
walter
mentions
that
they
dined
with
eliza
and
her
mother
on
their
way
back
to
hampshire
they
talked
much
of
the
satisfaction
their
visit
into
kent
had
afforded
them
what
did
you
think
of
my
uncle
looks
i
was
much
pleased
with
them
and
if
possible
he
appeared
more
amiable
than
ever
to
me
what
an
excellent
and
pleasing
man
he
is
i
love
him
most
sincerely
as
indeed
i
do
all
the
family
i
believe
it
was
your
first
acquaintance
with
cassandra
and
jane
though
philadelphia
reply
to
this
letter
has
not
been
preserved
we
have
a
letter
of
hers
to
her
brother
writing
on
july
she
says
yesterday
i
began
an
acquaintance
with
my
two
female
cousins
austens
my
uncle
aunt
cassandra
and
jane
arrived
at
the
day
before
we
dined
with
them
there
as
pure
nature
to
love
ourselves
i
may
be
allowed
to
give
the
preference
to
the
eldest
who
is
generally
reckoned
a
most
striking
resemblance
of
me
in
features
complexion
and
manners
i
never
found
myself
so
much
disposed
to
be
vain
as
i
ca
help
thinking
her
very
pretty
but
fancied
i
could
discover
was
not
so
well
pleased
with
the
comparison
which
reflection
abated
a
great
deal
of
the
vanity
so
likely
to
arise
and
so
proper
to
be
the
youngest
jane
is
very
like
her
brother
henry
not
at
all
pretty
and
very
prim
unlike
a
girl
of
twelve
but
it
is
hasty
judgment
which
you
will
scold
me
for
my
aunt
has
lost
several
which
makes
her
look
old
my
uncle
is
quite
but
looks
vastly
well
all
in
high
spirits
and
disposed
to
be
pleased
with
each
other
a
day
or
two
later
philadelphia
wrote
further
i
continue
to
admire
my
amiable
likeness
the
best
of
the
two
in
every
respect
she
keeps
up
conversation
in
a
very
sensible
and
pleasing
manner
yesterday
they
all
spent
the
day
with
us
and
the
more
i
see
of
cassandra
the
more
i
admire
her
jane
is
whimsical
and
affected
at
all
pretty
and
affected
jane
one
is
tempted
to
exclaim
but
whatever
she
would
have
said
to
this
estimate
of
herself
of
one
thing
we
may
be
perfectly
sure
that
she
would
have
been
the
first
to
agree
with
her
critic
as
to
her
own
absolute
inferiority
to
cassandra
there
is
a
passage
in
a
letter
written
from
southampton
february
in
which
she
says
she
is
often
astonishment
and
when
she
thinks
of
her
own
manners
as
a
young
girl
and
contrasts
them
with
what
she
sees
in
the
children
of
a
later
date
one
other
mention
of
jane
at
this
period
may
be
quoted
that
of
sir
egerton
brydges
the
author
and
genealogist
his
sister
had
married
lefroy
who
in
had
become
rector
of
ashe
the
living
which
george
austen
would
have
held
had
it
become
vacant
before
deane
in
succession
to
russell
sir
egerton
on
his
marriage
in
had
for
two
years
rented
austen
parsonage
at
deane
in
order
to
be
near
his
sister
the
nearest
neighbours
of
the
lefroys
were
the
austens
at
steventon
i
remember
jane
austen
the
novelist
as
a
little
child
she
was
very
intimate
with
lefroy
and
much
encouraged
by
her
her
mother
was
a
miss
leigh
whose
paternal
grandmother
was
sister
to
the
first
duke
of
chandos
austen
was
of
a
kentish
family
of
which
several
branches
have
been
settled
in
the
weald
of
kent
and
some
are
still
remaining
there
when
i
knew
jane
austen
i
never
suspected
that
she
was
an
authoress
but
my
eyes
told
me
that
she
was
fair
and
handsome
slight
and
elegant
but
with
cheeks
a
little
too
full
sir
egerton
description
is
the
more
pleasing
of
the
two
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
he
was
writing
long
after
the
time
he
mentions
and
that
his
recollections
were
no
doubt
somewhat
mellowed
by
jane
subsequent
fame
whereas
philadelphia
walter
is
an
unvarnished
contemporary
criticism
the
impression
made
by
jane
on
a
girl
a
few
years
older
than
herself
fortunately
neither
looks
nor
manners
are
stereotyped
at
the
age
of
twelve
so
we
need
not
be
surprised
to
find
that
eliza
when
writing
in
august
in
reference
to
a
letter
just
received
from
steventon
talks
of
the
two
sisters
as
beauties
who
were
of
course
gaining
by
dozens
and
again
in
november
of
the
same
year
she
writes
that
she
hears
are
two
of
the
prettiest
girls
in
england
when
due
allowance
is
made
for
family
exaggeration
we
may
conclude
that
at
eighteen
and
fifteen
years
of
age
both
cassandra
and
jane
had
their
fair
share
of
good
looks
eliza
letters
give
us
another
glimpse
of
the
sisters
in
and
indeed
of
the
whole
steventon
party
she
writes
on
september
i
have
the
real
pleasure
of
informing
you
that
our
dear
uncle
and
aunt
are
both
in
perfect
health
the
former
looks
uncommonly
well
and
in
my
opinion
his
likeness
to
my
beloved
mother
is
stronger
than
ever
often
do
i
sit
and
trace
her
features
in
his
till
my
heart
overflows
at
my
eyes
i
always
tenderly
loved
my
uncle
but
i
think
he
is
now
dearer
to
me
than
ever
as
being
the
nearest
and
best
beloved
relation
of
the
never
to
be
sufficiently
regretted
parent
i
have
lost
cassandra
and
jane
are
both
very
much
grown
the
latter
is
now
taller
than
myself
and
greatly
improved
as
well
in
manners
as
in
person
both
of
which
are
now
much
more
formed
than
when
you
saw
them
they
are
i
think
equally
sensible
and
both
so
to
a
degree
seldom
met
with
but
still
my
heart
gives
the
preference
to
jane
whose
kind
partiality
to
me
indeed
requires
a
return
of
the
same
nature
henry
is
now
rather
more
than
six
feet
high
i
believe
he
also
is
much
improved
and
is
certainly
endowed
with
uncommon
abilities
which
indeed
seem
to
have
been
bestowed
though
in
a
different
way
upon
each
member
of
this
family
as
to
the
coolness
which
you
know
had
taken
place
between
and
myself
it
has
now
ceased
in
consequence
of
due
acknowledgement
on
his
part
and
we
are
at
present
on
very
proper
relationlike
terms
you
know
that
his
family
design
him
for
the
church
cassandra
was
from
home
when
i
arrived
she
was
then
on
a
visit
to
rowling
the
abode
of
her
brother
edward
from
which
she
returned
some
time
since
but
is
now
once
more
absent
as
well
as
her
sister
on
a
visit
to
the
miss
lloyds
who
live
at
a
place
called
ibthorp
about
eighteen
miles
from
hence
there
has
been
a
club
ball
at
basingstoke
and
a
private
one
in
the
neighbourhood
both
of
which
my
cousins
say
were
very
agreeable
the
date
or
must
be
assigned
to
the
portrait
believed
to
be
of
jane
austen
and
believed
to
be
by
zoffany
which
has
been
chosen
as
the
frontispiece
for
this
book
as
it
was
for
lord
brabourne
edition
of
the
letters
we
are
unable
for
want
of
evidence
to
judge
of
the
likeness
of
the
picture
to
jane
austen
as
a
girl
there
is
so
far
as
we
have
heard
no
family
tradition
of
her
having
been
painted
and
as
her
subsequent
fame
could
hardly
have
been
predicted
we
should
not
expect
that
either
her
frank
or
her
cousin
francis
motley
austen
would
go
to
the
expense
of
a
picture
of
her
by
zoffany
francis
motley
had
a
daughter
of
his
own
another
jane
austen
who
became
campion
of
danny
and
a
confusion
between
the
two
janes
is
a
possible
explanation
on
the
other
hand
we
believe
there
is
no
tradition
in
either
the
austen
or
the
campion
family
of
any
such
portrait
of
jane
austen
and
the
of
our
picture
is
well
authenticated
the
rev
morland
rice
grandson
of
edward
austen
was
a
demy
of
magdalen
college
oxford
an
old
fellow
of
magdalen
newman
many
years
before
his
death
told
him
that
he
had
a
portrait
of
jane
austen
the
novelist
that
had
long
been
in
his
family
he
stated
that
it
was
painted
at
bath
when
she
was
about
fifteen
and
he
promised
to
leave
him
rice
the
picture
a
few
months
before
his
death
newman
wrote
to
his
friend
bloxam
sending
him
a
picture
as
a
farewell
present
and
adding
have
another
picture
that
i
wish
to
go
to
your
neighbour
morland
rice
it
is
a
portrait
of
jane
austen
the
novelist
by
zoffany
the
picture
was
given
to
my
stepmother
by
her
friend
colonel
austen
of
kippington
kent
because
she
was
a
great
admirer
of
her
works
colonel
austen
was
a
son
of
francis
motley
and
it
is
hardly
conceivable
that
he
should
give
away
to
a
stranger
a
portrait
of
his
jane
as
one
of
his
jane
our
jane
became
fifteen
on
december
and
zoffany
returned
from
india
in
that
year
jane
is
believed
to
have
visited
her
uncle
cooper
who
died
in
at
bath
there
is
nothing
in
these
dates
to
raise
any
great
difficulty
and
on
the
whole
we
have
good
reason
to
hope
that
we
possess
in
this
picture
an
authentic
portrait
of
the
author
the
austens
seem
to
have
been
possessed
of
considerable
histrionic
talent
and
they
were
decidedly
ambitious
in
the
plays
they
undertook
their
cousin
eliza
was
out
of
england
in
when
their
theatricals
first
began
but
on
a
later
occasion
she
was
one
of
the
principal
performers
they
had
their
summer
theatre
in
the
barn
and
their
winter
theatre
either
there
or
within
the
narrow
limits
of
the
where
the
number
of
listeners
must
have
been
very
small
in
sheridan
was
acted
by
ladies
and
gentlemen
at
steventon
the
same
year
they
seem
to
have
given
also
the
tragedy
of
it
was
the
day
of
prologues
and
epilogues
and
the
young
actors
were
careful
to
omit
nothing
that
would
make
the
performance
complete
james
the
eldest
son
brought
into
play
his
skill
in
and
we
read
of
henry
austen
speaking
a
prologue
from
his
brother
pen
to
while
the
prologue
to
was
given
by
edward
austen
and
the
epilogue
by
thomas
fowle
midsummer
and
christmas
were
the
two
seasons
when
george
austen
dismissed
his
pupils
for
their
holidays
and
it
was
at
these
two
periods
that
the
theatricals
usually
took
place
for
the
year
we
have
a
few
details
as
to
contemplated
performances
eliza
de
feuillide
had
come
to
england
with
her
mother
in
the
summer
of
and
probably
went
to
steventon
at
midsummer
in
september
she
was
at
tunbridge
wells
with
her
mother
and
her
cousin
phila
in
a
letter
to
her
brother
phila
tells
us
that
they
went
to
the
theatre
where
as
was
the
custom
in
those
days
the
comtesse
presumably
as
a
person
of
some
importance
the
play
which
was
is
the
man
and
this
is
interesting
because
later
on
in
the
same
letter
phila
says
the
comtesse
and
her
mother
go
at
christmas
to
steventon
and
mean
to
act
a
play
is
the
man
and
my
uncle
barn
is
fitting
up
quite
like
a
theatre
and
all
the
young
folks
are
to
take
their
part
the
countess
is
lady
bob
lardoon
in
the
former
and
miss
tittup
in
the
latter
they
wish
me
much
of
the
party
and
offer
to
carry
me
but
i
do
not
think
of
it
i
should
like
to
be
a
spectator
but
am
sure
i
should
not
have
courage
to
act
a
part
nor
do
i
wish
to
attain
it
eliza
was
however
very
urgent
with
phila
that
she
should
send
all
diffidence
your
accommodations
at
steventon
are
the
only
things
my
aunt
austen
and
myself
are
uneasy
about
as
the
house
being
very
full
of
company
she
says
she
can
only
promise
you
place
to
hide
your
head
in
but
i
think
you
will
not
mind
this
inconvenience
i
am
sure
i
should
not
to
be
with
you
do
not
let
your
dress
neither
disturb
you
as
i
think
i
can
manage
it
so
that
the
should
provide
you
with
what
is
necessary
for
acting
we
purpose
setting
out
the
of
december
i
assure
you
we
shall
have
a
most
brilliant
party
and
a
great
deal
of
amusement
the
house
full
of
company
frequent
balls
you
can
not
possibly
resist
so
many
temptations
especially
when
i
tell
you
your
old
friend
james
is
returned
from
france
and
is
to
be
of
the
acting
party
but
phila
still
stood
out
and
eliza
attacked
her
once
more
on
november
begging
her
to
come
for
a
fortnight
to
steventon
provided
she
could
bring
herself
to
act
my
aunt
austen
declares
she
has
not
room
for
any
young
we
hear
no
more
news
of
these
theatricals
but
it
is
probable
that
there
was
a
change
in
the
selection
of
the
plays
for
there
is
extant
a
prologue
by
james
austen
to
acted
at
steventon
december
and
as
well
as
an
epilogue
by
a
lady
in
the
character
of
violante
there
is
also
a
prologue
to
acted
at
steventon
january
the
last
steventon
performances
of
which
we
have
any
knowledge
took
place
in
january
when
a
farce
called
was
acted
the
leading
lady
on
this
last
occasion
was
miss
cooper
who
spoke
the
epilogue
in
the
character
of
roxalana
henry
austen
playing
the
on
the
same
occasion
townley
farce
life
below
was
also
given
of
jane
own
part
in
these
performances
there
is
no
record
for
she
was
only
just
fourteen
when
the
last
took
place
but
even
if
she
took
no
more
share
than
fanny
price
she
must
have
acquired
a
considerable
acquaintance
with
the
language
of
the
theatre
knowledge
that
she
was
to
turn
to
good
account
in
she
was
an
early
observer
and
it
might
reasonably
be
supposed
that
some
of
the
incidents
and
feelings
which
are
so
vividly
painted
in
the
theatricals
are
due
to
her
recollections
of
these
entertainments
the
talent
and
liveliness
which
she
would
show
if
ever
she
had
an
opportunity
of
acting
herself
may
be
imagined
the
late
sir
william
heathcote
is
said
to
have
remembered
being
with
her
at
a
twelfth
night
party
when
he
was
a
little
boy
on
which
occasion
she
having
drawn
the
part
of
candour
acted
it
with
appreciation
and
spirit

it
may

that

could
rival

and
by
professing
to
dine
with
families
there
was
nevertheless
for
a
quiet
country
neighbourhood
a
very
fair
amount
of
society
to
be
had
around
steventon
readers
of
jane
austen
letters
will
come
across
the
names
of
many
hampshire
neighbours
with
occasional
indications
of
the
estimate
which
she
formed
of
their
intellects
and
characters
probably
there
were
many
different
degrees
of
refinement
in
different
families
and
towards
the
bottom
of
the
list
must
have
come
the
squire
of
many
acres
who
we
are
told
inquired
of
austen
whether
paris
was
in
france
or
france
in
paris
and
who
quoted
a
speech
of
the
rector
wife
as
beginning
with
a
round
oath
saying
when
remonstrated
with
that
it
was
merely
his
of
telling
the
story
when
the
author
of
the
expresses
his
belief
that
a
century
and
a
half
ago
the
improvement
of
manners
in
most
country
parishes
began
with
the
clergy
he
was
no
doubt
thinking
of
the
more
learned
minority
of
that
body
who
would
bring
into
the
depths
of
the
country
something
of
the
enlightenment
of
a
university
to
this
minority
jane
father
and
brother
belonged
and
thus
the
family
probably
gave
to
the
society
around
them
at
least
as
much
culture
as
they
received
from
it
in
return
in
the
outer
circle
of
their
neighbourhood
stood
the
houses
of
three
peers
those
of
lord
portsmouth
at
hurstbourne
lord
bolton
at
hackwood
and
lord
dorchester
at
greywell
the
owners
of
these
places
now
and
then
gave
balls
at
home
and
could
also
be
relied
upon
to
bring
parties
to
some
of
the
assemblies
at
basingstoke
hardly
less
important
than
these
magnates
were
the
mildmays
of
dogmersfield
and
the
chutes
of
the
vyne
the
chute
of
that
day
was
not
only
one
of
the
two
for
the
whole
county
of
hampshire
but
was
also
a
and
popular
and
the
husband
of
an
excellent
and
cultivated
wife

there
were
three

more
than

of
these

heathcote
and
was
the
mother
of
sir
william
heathcote
of

a
fine
specimen
morally
and
intellectually
of

the
more
important
to
the

one
of
the
latest
of

extant
letters
is
addressed
to

a
still
closer
friendship
united

named

for
a
short
time
inhabited
their

parsonage
at

had
been
a
craven
one
of
the
unhappy
daughters
of
a
beautiful
and
fashionable
but
utterly
neglectful
mother
who
left
them
to
shift
for
themselves
and
to
marry
where
they
could
in
this
respect
martha
craven
had
done
better
than
some
of
her
sisters
having
become
the
wife
of
a
beneficed
clergyman
of
respectable
character
and
good
position
with
him
she
had
led
a
peaceful
life
and
on
his
death
in
january
she
spent
the
first
two
or
three
years
of
a
quiet
widowhood
at
deane
her
second
daughter
eliza
was
then
already
married
to
a
first
cousin
fulwar
craven
fowle
but
the
two
others
martha
and
mary
were
still
at
home
both
became
fast
friends
of
cassandra
and
jane
and
both
were
destined
eventually
to
marry
into
the
austen
family
for
the
present
their
near
neighbourhood
came
to
an
end
at
the
beginning
of
when
lloyd
removed
to
ibthorp
eighteen
miles
distant
from
steventon
it
was
on
the
occasion
of
this
removal
that
jane
then
just
sixteen
years
old
presented
to
mary
lloyd
an
interesting
specimen
of
her
own
needlework
still
existing
it
is
a
very
small
bag
containing
a
yet
smaller
housewife
furnished
with
minikin
needles
and
fine
thread
in
the
housewife
is
a
tiny
pocket
and
in
the
pocket
is
enclosed
a
slip
of
paper
on
which
written
as
with
a
are
these
lines
this
little
bag
i
hope
will
prove
to
be
not
vainly
made
for
should
you
thread
and
needles
want
it
will
afford
you
aid
and
as
we
are
about
to
part
serve
another
end
for
when
you
look
upon
this
bag
you
recollect
your
friend
it
is
made
of
a
scrap
of
gingham
and
having
been
carefully
preserved
it
is
in
as
perfect
a
condition
as
when
it
was
first
made
a
hundred
and
twenty
years
ago
and
shows
that
the
same
hand
which
painted
so
exquisitely
with
the
pen
could
work
as
delicately
with
the
needle
martha
lloyd
also
had
her
dedicatory
poem
some
years
later
when
it
seems
she
wanted
to
go
to
harrogate
and
hoped
in
vain
for
the
escort
of
a
best
jane
presented
her
with
a
copy
of
doggerel
and
probably
almost
extemporaneous
verses
oh
best
you
very
bad
and
all
the
world
shall
know
it
your
base
behaviour
shall
be
sung
by
me
a
tuneful
poet
you
used
to
go
to
harrogate
each
summer
as
it
came
and
why
i
pray
should
you
refuse
to
go
this
year
the
same
the
way
as
plain
the
road
as
smooth
the
posting
not
increased
you
scarcely
stouter
than
you
were
not
younger
sir
at
least
we
must
mention
one
other
intimate
friendship
that
which
existed
between
the
austens
and
the
lefroys
of
ashe
lefroy
was
rector
of
that
parish
and
his
wife
known
within
it
as
lefroy
was
sister
to
sir
egerton
brydges
to
whom
we
are
indebted
for
the
very
early
notice
of
jane
austen
as
a
girl
which
we
have
already
given
lefroy
was
a
remarkable
person
her
rare
endowments
of
goodness
talents
graceful
person
and
engaging
manners
were
sufficient
to
secure
her
a
prominent
place
in
any
society
into
which
she
was
thrown
while
her
enthusiastic
eagerness
of
disposition
rendered
her
especially
attractive
to
a
clever
and
lively
girl
how
intensely
jane
loved
and
admired
her
is
shown
by
some
lines
which
she
wrote
on
december
the
anniversary
both
of
her
own
birth
and
of
the
sudden
death
of
her
friend
killed
by
a
fall
from
her
horse
in
it
has
sometimes
been
assumed
that
the
in
expressions
of
affection
to
be
found
throughout
jane
published
writings
and
the
they
display
in
matters
of
emotion
arises
from
the
fact
that
in
the
nature
there
were
no
very
ardent
affections
to
be
restrained
and
no
overpowering
emotions
to
be
suppressed
these
lines
show
the
baselessness
of
such
an
assumption
it
was
not
for
the
gaze
of
the
public
but
to
relieve
her
own
heart
that
jane
at
the
age
of
wrote
thus
four
years
after
the
death
of
this
elder
friend
here
she
dared
to
speak
as
she
felt
striving
in
all
the
warmth
and
depth
of
enduring
attachment
and
admiration
to
paint
a
character
which
she
yet
declares
to
have
been
her
power
to
praise
the
verses
continue
thus
but
come
fond
fancy
thou
indulgent
power
hope
is
desponding
chill
severe
to
thee
bless
thou
this
little
portion
of
an
hour
let
me
behold
her
as
she
used
to
be
i
see
her
here
with
all
her
smiles
benign
her
looks
of
eager
love
her
accents
sweet
that
voice
and
countenance
almost
divine
expression
harmony
alike
complete
listen
it
is
not
sound
alone
is
sense
is
genius
taste
and
tenderness
of
soul
is
genuine
warmth
of
heart
without
pretence
and
purity
of
mind
that
crowns
the
whole
can
aught
enhance
such
goodness
yes
to
me
her
partial
favour
from
my
earliest
years
consummates
all
ah
give
me
but
to
see
her
smile
of
love
the
vision
disappears
time
was
now
to
bring
changes
to
the
austens
the
elder
brothers
married
james
had
a
curacy
at
overton
and
near
overton
was
laverstoke
manor
house
now
occupied
by
general
and
lady
jane
mathew
james
became
engaged
to
their
daughter
anne
five
years
older
than
himself
they
were
married
in
march
and
started
life
on
an
income
of
of
which
was
an
allowance
made
by
general
mathew
keeping
it
is
said
a
small
pack
of
harriers
for
the
husband
and
a
close
carriage
for
the
wife
james
afterwards
moved
to
deane
where
he
was
his
father
curate
the
married
life
of
the
couple
was
but
short
their
one
child
always
known
as
anna
was
born
in
april
and
the
mother
died
suddenly
in
may
leaving
to
her
daughter
only
a
shadowy
recollection
of
tall
and
slender
lady
dressed
in
white
the
poor
little
girl
fretted
in
her
solitude
till
her
father
took
the
wise
step
of
sending
her
to
steventon
rectory
to
be
comforted
by
her
aunts
she
was
admitted
to
the
which
was
now
becoming
a
place
of
eager
authorship
anna
was
a
very
intelligent
child
and
hearing
the
original
draft
of
and
read
aloud
by
its
youthful
writer
to
her
sister
she
caught
up
the
names
of
the
characters
and
repeated
them
so
much
downstairs
that
she
had
to
be
checked
for
the
composition
of
the
story
was
still
a
secret
kept
from
the
knowledge
of
the
elders
anna
also
composed
stories
herself
long
before
she
could
write
them
down
and
preserved
a
vivid
remembrance
of
her
dear
aunt
jane
performing
that
task
for
her
and
then
telling
her
others
of
endless
adventure
and
fun
which
were
carried
on
from
day
to
day
or
from
visit
to
visit
towards
the
end
of
james
became
engaged
to
mary
lloyd
and
they
were
married
early
in
the
marriage
could
hardly
have
happened
had
not
general
mathew
continued
for
the
sake
of
anna
the
a
year
which
he
had
allowed
to
his
daughter
the
event
must
have
been
most
welcome
to
jane
and
austen
wrote
a
very
cheerful
and
friendly
letter
to
her
elect
expressing
the
heartfelt
satisfaction
at
the
prospect
she
adds
the
selection
been
mine
you
my
dear
mary
are
the
person
i
should
have
chosen
for
james
wife
anna
mother
and
my
daughter
being
as
certain
as
i
can
be
of
anything
in
this
uncertain
world
that
you
will
greatly
increase
and
promote
the
happiness
of
each
of
the
three
i
look
forward
to
you
as
a
real
comfort
to
me
in
my
old
age
when
cassandra
is
gone
into
shropshire
and
jane
the
lord
knows
where
tell
martha
she
too
shall
be
my
daughter
she
does
me
honour
in
the
request
there
was
an
unconscious
prophecy
contained
in
the
last
words
for
martha
became
eventually
the
second
wife
of
the
writer
son
francis
edward
austen
marriage
had
preceded
his
brother
by
a
few
months
his
kind
patrons
the
knights
would
be
sure
to
make
this
easy
for
him
and
it
must
have
been
under
their
auspices
that
he
married
before
the
end
of
elizabeth
daughter
of
sir
brook
bridges
and
was
settled
at
rowling
a
small
house
belonging
to
the
bridges
family
about
a
mile
away
from
their
seat
at
goodnestone
no
doubt
it
was
a
suitable
match
but
it
must
also
have
been
a
marriage
of
affection
if
one
may
judge
from
the
happy
life
which
ensued
and
from
the
lovely
features
of
edward
austen
preserved
in
the
miniature
by
cosway
some
of
earliest
extant
letters
were
written
from
rowling
the
place
was
not
however
to
be
the
home
of
the
edward
austens
for
long
thomas
knight
died
in
leaving
his
large
estates
to
his
widow
for
her
life
three
years
later
in
she
determined
to
make
them
over
at
once
to
the
adopted
son
who
was
after
her
death
to
become
their
owner
retaining
for
herself
only
an
income
of
on
learning
her
intentions
he
sent
her
a
most
grateful
and
affectionate
letter
saying
that
he
wrote
because
he
felt
himself
incapable
of
speaking
with
her
on
the
subject
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
and
his
wife
to
accede
to
her
plan
for
they
should
never
be
happy
at
godmersham
whilst
she
was
living
in
a
smaller
and
less
comfortable
house
having
quitted
a
mansion
where
he
had
so
often
heard
her
say
her
whole
happiness
was
centred
this
protest
by
no
means
turned
knight
from
her
intentions
on
the
contrary
she
expressed
them
still
more
strongly
and
in
so
charming
a
spirit
that
we
must
quote
a
considerable
part
of
her
letter
godmersham
park
friday
if
anything
were
wanting
my
dearest
edward
to
confirm
my
resolution
concerning
the
plan
i
propose
executing
your
letter
would
have
that
effect
it
is
impossible
for
any
person
to
express
their
gratitude
and
affection
in
terms
more
pleasing
and
gratifying
than
you
have
chosen
and
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
believe
you
to
be
perfectly
sincere
when
you
assure
me
that
your
happiness
is
best
secured
by
seeing
me
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
everything
that
can
contribute
to
my
ease
and
comfort
and
that
happiness
my
dear
edward
will
be
yours
by
acceding
to
my
wishes
from
the
time
that
my
partiality
for
you
induced
knight
to
treat
you
as
our
adopted
child
i
have
felt
for
you
the
tenderness
of
a
mother
and
never
have
you
appeared
more
deserving
of
affection
than
at
this
time
to
reward
your
merit
therefore
and
to
place
you
in
a
situation
where
your
many
excellent
qualities
will
be
call
forth
and
render
useful
to
the
neighbourhood
is
the
fondest
wish
of
my
heart
many
circumstances
attached
to
large
landed
possessions
highly
gratifying
to
a
man
are
entirely
lost
on
me
at
present
but
when
i
see
you
in
enjoyment
of
them
i
shall
if
possible
feel
my
gratitude
to
my
beloved
husband
redoubled
for
having
placed
in
my
hands
the
power
of
bestowing
happiness
on
one
so
very
dear
to
me
if
my
income
had
not
been
sufficient
to
enable
us
both
to
live
in
affluence
i
should
never
have
proposed
this
plan
for
nothing
would
have
given
me
more
pain
than
to
have
seen
a
rigid
economy
take
the
place
of
that
liberality
which
the
poor
have
always
experienced
from
the
family
but
with
the
income
i
have
assigned
you
i
trust
my
dear
edward
you
will
feel
yourself
rich
you
may
assure
yourself
and
my
dear
lizzie
that
the
pain
i
shall
feel
in
quitting
this
dear
place
will
no
longer
be
remembered
when
i
see
you
in
possession
of
it
my
attachment
to
it
can
i
think
only
cease
with
my
life
but
if
i
am
near
enough
to
be
your
frequent
daily
visitor
and
within
reach
of
the
sight
of
you
and
your
boys
and
lizzie
and
her
girls
i
trust
i
shall
be
as
happy
perhaps
happier
than
i
am
now
your
most
sincere
friend
meanwhile
francis
austen
had
made
a
good
start
in
his
profession
going
out
to
the
east
indies
according
to
the
custom
of
those
days
as
a
he
became
a
midshipman
but
remained
one
for
four
years
only
promotion
long
thought
of
dearly
earned
and
justly
valued
blessing
was
bestowed
upon
him
two
years
sooner
than
it
fell
to
the
lot
of
william
price
in
and
he
became
a
lieutenant
at
the
age
of
seventeen
a
sufficient
testimony
to
that
steadiness
of
character
which
distinguished
him
throughout
the
course
of
a
very
long
life
as
lieutenant
he
remained
another
year
in
the
east
indies
and
then
returned
to
serve
on
the
home
station
the
result
of
this
last
move
was
that
in
rather
more
than
a
year
after
the
marriages
of
james
and
edward
their
parents
had
the
delight
of
welcoming
back
a
son
who
having
quitted
them
as
a
boy
not
yet
fifteen
years
old
reappeared
as
a
young
man
and
successful
officer
of
whom
his
family
might
be
justly
proud
other
events
grave
and
gay
were
now
happening
at
steventon
besides
eliza
de
feuillide
who
took
refuge
there
with
her
young
son
while
the
clouds
were
gathering
round
her
husband
in
france
the
rectory
had
another
visitor
in
the
summer
of
in
jane
cooper
daughter
of
austen
only
sister
who
came
here
after
her
father
death
cooper
had
set
out
in
june
with
his
son
and
daughter
and
his
neighbours
the
lybbe
powyses
on
a
tour
to
the
isle
of
wight
the
tour
had
important
results
for
the
young
coopers
as
edward
became
engaged
to
caroline
lybbe
powys
and
his
sister
to
captain
thomas
williams
whom
she
met
at
ryde
cooper
whose
health
had
been
the
chief
reason
for
the
tour
did
not
long
survive
his
return
dying
at
sonning
of
which
he
had
been
vicar
since
on
august
the
date
of
his
daughter
wedding
was
already
fixed
but
had
of
course
to
be
postponed
she
went
immediately
to
steventon
and
was
married
from
the
rectory
on
december
of
the
same
year
one
happy
result
of
this
marriage
was
to
provide
an
opening
for
the
naval
career
of
the
youngest
of
the
austens
charles
who
was
three
years
younger
than
jane
and
whom
we
last
met
in
the
nursery
as
he
was
also
five
years
junior
to
francis
the
latter
must
have
quitted
the
naval
academy
some
time
before
his
brother
entered
it
charles
austen
was
one
of
those
happy
mortals
destined
to
be
loved
from
childhood
to
old
age
by
every
one
with
whom
they
come
in
contact
how
great
a
favourite
he
was
at
home
is
easily
to
be
read
between
the
lines
of
his
sister
letters
and
when
he
died
at
the
age
of
as
admiral
of
the
british
fleet
in
the
burmese
waters
one
who
was
with
him
wrote
that
death
was
a
great
grief
to
the
whole
fleet
i
know
i
cried
bitterly
when
i
found
he
was
dead
the
charming
expression
of
countenance
in
the
miniatures
still
existing
of
this
youngest
brother
makes
such
feelings
quite
comprehensible
on
leaving
the
academy
he
served
under
his
cousin
husband
captain
thomas
williams
and
was
fortunate
enough
to
witness
and
take
part
in
a
most
gallant
action
when
in
june
captain
williams
frigate
the
gave
chase
to
a
french
frigate
and
after
a
run
of
two
hundred
and
ten
miles
succeeded
in
capturing
her
to
charles
at
the
age
of
seventeen
this
must
have
been
a
very
exciting
experience
while
to
captain
williams
it
brought
the
honour
of
knighthood
what
with
their
visitors
and
their
dances
and
with
a
wedding
to
prepare
for
life
must
have
been
gay
enough
for
the
miss
austens
during
the
autumn
of
cassandra
and
jane
were
now
of
an
age
to
enjoy
as
much
dancing
as
they
could
get
in
fact
if
jane
began
dancing
as
early
as
she
made
lydia
bennet
begin
she
may
already
have
been
going
for
a
year
or
two
to
the
monthly
assemblies
that
basingstoke
like
every
other
town
of
any
size
boasted
of
during
the
winter
months
unfortunately
we
know
very
little
of
jane
personal
history
from
to
most
of
her
time
would
naturally
be
spent
at
home
but
we
catch
an
occasional
glimpse
of
her
now
dancing
at
southampton
now
travelling
with
cassandra
one
hot
summer
day
from
london
to
stay
with
her
brother
edward
at
rowling
in
now
visiting
in
gloucestershire
early
in
came
the
shock
of
the
execution
of
the
comte
de
feuillide
and
eliza
widowed
and
motherless
and
with
an
invalid
boy
must
have
become
more
of
a
serious
care
to
her
relations
over
the
acquittal
of
her
benefactor
and
godfather
warren
hastings
there
was
but
one
feeling
in
the
family
they
all
admired
him
as
a
patriot
a
warm
and
disinterested
friend
and
a
scholar
whose
approbation
was
an
honour
the
event
inspired
henry
austen
with
more
than
his
usual
grandeur
of
language
me
he
says
writing
to
hastings
congratulate
my
country
and
myself
as
an
englishman
for
right
dear
to
every
englishman
must
it
be
to
behold
the
issue
of
a
combat
where
forms
of
judicature
threatened
to
annihilate
the
essence
of
justice
one
event
of
the
deepest
interest
occurred
during
this
period
namely
cassandra
engagement
to
thomas
fowle
brother
of
eliza
husband
which
probably
took
place
in
when
she
was
years
old
she
had
known
him
from
childhood
as
he
was
a
pupil
at
steventon
rectory
in
fowle
had
taken
orders
and
was
at
this
time
rector
of
allington
in
wiltshire
an
immediate
marriage
did
not
seem
prudent
but
advancement
was
hoped
for
from
his
kinsman
lord
craven
and
as
one
of
the
livings
in
his
gift
was
ryton
in
shropshire
it
must
have
been
to
this
place
that
austen
alluded
as
the
future
home
of
cassandra
in
the
letter
to
her
intended
mary
lloyd
at
present
however
lord
craven
could
only
show
his
interest
in
fowle
by
taking
him
out
with
him
to
the
west
indies
as
chaplain
to
his
own
regiment
jane
literary
projects
were
now
assuming
a
more
definite
shape
although
the
process
of
selection
and
elimination
both
in
subjects
and
method
was
not
yet
finished
to
this
period
belongs
and
a
first
sketch
for
and
but
written
in
letters
we
know
that
it
was
read
aloud
but
no
details
have
come
down
to
us
and
it
is
difficult
to
guess
between
whom
the
letters
can
have
passed
for
in
the
novel
elinor
and
marianne
are
never
parted
even
for
a
single
day
it
seems
therefore
as
if
the
alterations
subsequently
made
must
have
been
radical
and
the
difficulty
and
labour
which
such
a
complete
transformation
would
involve
make
the
author
unfavourable
judgment
on
her
own
earlier
method
of
writing
all
the
stronger
if
she
decided
against
using
letters
as
a
vehicle
for
in
the
future
it
seems
all
the
more
probable
that
the
only
other
instance
of
her
use
of
this
style
was
at
least
as
early
as
the
date
we
have
now
reached
the
author
of
the
yielded
with
reluctance
to
many
solicitations
asking
him
to
include
in
his
second
edition
while
he
himself
agreed
with
other
critics
that
the
work
was
one
on
which
a
literary
reputation
could
be
founded
as
a
stage
in
the
development
of
the
author
it
has
great
interest
strictly
speaking
it
is
not
a
story
but
a
study
there
is
hardly
any
attempt
at
a
plot
or
at
the
grouping
of
various
characters
such
as
exist
are
kept
in
the
background
and
serve
chiefly
to
bring
into
bolder
relief
the
one
highly
finished
wholly
sinister
figure
which
occupies
the
canvas
but
which
seems
with
the
completion
of
the
study
to
have
disappeared
entirely
from
the
mind
of
its
creator
it
is
equally
remarkable
that
an
inexperienced
girl
should
have
had
independence
and
boldness
enough
to
draw
at
full
length
a
woman
of
the
type
of
lady
susan
and
that
after
she
had
done
so
the
purity
of
her
imagination
and
the
delicacy
of
her
taste
should
have
prevented
her
from
ever
repeating
the
experiment
but
if
jane
austen
never
again
wrote
a
story
in
letters
no
one
was
ever
more
successful
in
using
them
for
exhibitions
of
character
the
letters
of
lucy
steele
collins
isabella
thorpe
lady
bertram
and
mary
musgrove
are
all
masterpieces
of
unconscious
humour
and
some
of
the
more
serious
letters
are
not
far
behind
them
the
extant
letters
of
jane
herself
begin
in
and
will
accompany
us
through
the
rest
of
the
story
they
are
far
the
most
important
additions
that
can
be
made
to
the
short
history
contained
in
the
and
the
little
notices
which
we
have
given
it
may
have
seemed
with
needless
particularity
of
her
relations
and
neighbours
have
been
given
partly
in
order
to
enable
the
readers
of
her
letters
to
follow
the
numerous
personal
allusions
to
be
found
in
them
we
must
not
however
try
to
extract
more
out
of
the
letters
than
they
will
yield
the
bulk
of
them
belong
to
the
collection
published
by
lord
brabourne
and
nearly
the
whole
of
this
collection
consists
of
letters
from
jane
to
cassandra
but
the
normal
condition
of
the
sisters
lives
was
to
be
together
residing
in
one
house
sleeping
in
one
room
we
can
therefore
only
learn
from
this
source
what
happened
on
the
comparatively
rare
occasions
when
they
were
separated
nor
is
this
all
for
a
good
deal
of
their
correspondence
is
missing
some
of
it
is
probably
lost
by
accident
a
great
deal
was
certainly
destroyed
by
cassandra
of
set
purpose
the
austens
had
a
great
hatred
and
dread
of
publicity
cassandra
felt
this
with
especial
force
and
the
memory
of
jane
was
to
her
so
sacred
that
to
allow
the
gaze
of
strangers
to
dwell
upon
the
actions
or
the
feelings
of
so
precious
a
being
would
have
seemed
to
her
nothing
short
of
profanation
in
her
old
age
she
became
aware
that
jane
fame
had
not
only
survived
but
increased
and
that
a
time
might
come
when
the
public
would
wish
to
know
more
details
of
her
life
than
had
been
given
in
the
short
memoir
written
by
henry
austen
and
prefixed
to
her
posthumous
works
cassandra
would
not
indeed
be
likely
to
think
it
possible
that
the
letters
themselves
should
be
published
but
they
might
be
made
use
of
as
materials
and
so
she
determined
to
do
what
must
have
been
a
great
sacrifice
and
burn
all
those
which
were
specially
dear
to
herself
feeling
confident
that
the
remainder
would
not
be
disturbed
the
destroyed
mss
without
doubt
included
much
that
would
have
been
of
particular
value
to
the
biographer
we
must
also
remember
that
the
correspondence
was
between
sisters
who
knew
each
of
them
what
the
other
was
thinking
and
could
feel
sure
that
nothing
one
might
say
would
be
misapprehended
by
the
other
and
the
sort
of
freemasonry
which
results
from
such
a
situation
adds
to
the
difficulty
of
perfect
comprehension
by
outsiders
jane
too
was
a
mistress
of
subtle
irony
the
inveterate
playfulness
which
is
constantly
cropping
up
in
her
books
appears
also
in
her
letters
secure
of
her
correspondent
she
could
pass
criticisms
impute
motives
and
imagine
circumstances
which
would
have
been
very
far
from
her
nature
had
she
thought
it
possible
that
any
less
perfectly
informed
third
person
could
see
them
all
our
authorities
agree
in
describing
her
as
one
of
the
most
considerate
and
least
censorious
of
mortals
was
singularly
free
says
one
of
her
nieces
the
habit
of
looking
out
for
foibles
for
her
own
amusement
or
the
entertainment
of
her
hearers
i
do
not
suppose
she
ever
in
her
life
said
a
sharp
thing
we
may
be
sure
therefore
that
when
she
seems
to
imply
that
her
mother
ailments
were
imaginary
or
that
knight
generosity
to
edward
was
insignificant
or
that
knight
herself
was
about
to
contract
a
second
marriage
she
is
no
more
serious
than
when
she
describes
herself
as
having
taken
too
much
wine
as
a
hardened
flirt
or
as
a
selfish
housekeeper
ordering
only
those
things
which
she
herself
preferred
we
must
therefore
take
the
letters
as
they
are
without
expecting
to
find
any
expression
of
views
on
such
important
subjects
as
religion
politics
or
literature
subjects
which
might
better
be
discussed
in
conversation
with
cassandra
and
with
these
limitations
in
our
minds
we
shall
probably
agree
with
bradley
who
does
not
find
the
letters
disappointing
because
jane
austen
who
wrote
the
novels
is
in
them
footnotes
lady
dorchester
gave
one

january

at
greywell
but
at

which
her
husband
acquired

before
the
end
of

eighteenth
century

the
gloucestershire

probably
to
the
fowles
at

it
was
far
from
being
his
wish
that
should
form
the
title
of
a
separate

this
work

to
be
printed
as
an
appendix
at
the
end
of
the

some
mistake
however
when
the
second
edition
appeared
the
whole
book
bore
the
title
of
on
its
outside
cover
how
little
she
expected
them
to
be
published
may
be
gathered
from
a
sentence
written
by
her
niece
anna
at
the
time
of
the
publication
of
the
can
fancy
what
the
indignation
of
aunt
cassandra
would
have
been
at
the
mere
idea
of
its
the
correspondence
being
read
and
commented
upon
by
any
of
us
nephews
and
nieces
little
or
great
and
studies
by
members
of
the
english
vol
ii
chapter
vi
romance
miss
mitford
in
a
paragraph
showing
some
hostility
to
jane
austen
tells
us
that
her
own
mother
spent
her
maiden
life
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
austens
and
knew
jane
as
prettiest
silliest
most
affected
butterfly
she
ever
remembers
it
is
perhaps
a
sufficient
answer
to
this
attack
if
we
remark
that
when
mitford
married
and
left
her
home
jane
was
barely
ten
years
old
and
that
at
a
date
two
years
later
she
was
accused
by
a
cousin
of
being
it
is
probable
that
on
growing
up
she
like
other
girls
enjoyed
admiration
and
it
is
certain
that
she
attracted
a
good
deal
of
it
but
she
says
so
much
to
her
elder
sister
and
mentor
about
one
particular
flirtation
that
we
may
be
sure
that
it
was
neither
a
serious
nor
a
frequent
occupation
with
her
in
a
letter
written
from
steventon
november
she
mentions
a
visit
from
her
friend
lefroy
and
adds
that
she
had
enough
private
conversation
with
her
to
hear
all
that
was
interesting
which
you
will
easily
credit
when
i
tell
you
that
of
her
nephew
she
said
nothing
at
all
and
of
her
friend
very
little
she
did
not
once
mention
the
name
of
the
former
to
and
i
was
too
proud
to
make
any
enquiries
but
on
my
father
afterwards
asking
where
he
was
i
learnt
that
he
was
gone
back
to
london
in
his
way
to
ireland
where
he
is
called
to
the
bar
and
means
to
practise
she
showed
me
a
letter
which
she
had
received
from
her
friend
a
few
weeks
ago
in
answer
to
one
written
by
her
to
recommend
a
nephew
of
russell
to
his
notice
at
cambridge
towards
the
end
of
which
was
a
sentence
to
this
effect
am
very
sorry
to
hear
of
austen
illness
it
would
give
me
particular
pleasure
to
have
an
opportunity
of
improving
my
acquaintance
with
that
family
with
a
hope
of
creating
to
myself
a
nearer
interest
but
at
present
i
can
not
indulge
any
expectation
of
it
this
is
rational
enough
there
is
less
love
and
more
sense
in
it
than
sometimes
appeared
before
and
i
am
very
well
satisfied
it
will
all
go
on
exceedingly
well
and
decline
away
in
a
very
reasonable
manner
there
seems
no
likelihood
of
his
coming
into
hampshire
this
christmas
and
it
is
therefore
most
probable
that
our
indifference
will
soon
be
mutual
unless
his
regard
which
appeared
to
spring
from
knowing
nothing
of
me
at
first
is
best
supported
by
never
seeing
me
lefroy
though
jane
was
interested
to
hear
of
him
had
evidently
not
touched
her
heart
and
we
should
know
nothing
more
of
him
if
it
were
not
for
a
letter
of
hers
to
her
brother
frank
written
more
than
fourteen
years
afterwards
and
published
in
the
i
wonder
whether
you
happened
to
see
blackall
marriage
in
the
papers
last
january
we
did
he
was
married
at
clifton
to
a
miss
lewis
whose
father
had
been
late
of
antigua
i
should
very
much
like
to
know
what
sort
of
a
woman
she
is
he
was
a
piece
of
perfection
noisy
perfection
himself
which
i
always
recollect
with
regard
we
had
noticed
a
few
months
before
his
succeeding
to
a
college
living
the
very
living
which
we
recollected
his
talking
of
and
wishing
for
an
exceeding
good
one
great
cadbury
in
somersetshire
i
could
wish
miss
lewis
to
be
of
a
silent
turn
and
rather
ignorant
but
naturally
intelligent
and
wishing
to
learn
fond
of
cold
veal
pies
green
tea
in
the
afternoon
and
a
green
at
night
north
cadbury
is
an
emmanuel
college
living
and
blackall
was
a
fellow
of
that
society
who
after
the
fashion
of
the
times
had
waited
long
for
his
living
and
his
wife
jane
had
known
him
well
and
liked
him
much
though
with
sufficient
detachment
to
remember
and
to
criticise
his
demonstrative
manners
his
love
of
instructing
others
and
other
little
peculiarities
the
of
must
have
been
a
young
cambridge
don
and
she
was
not
likely
to
have
had
an
opportunity
of
knowing
individually
more
than
one
of
that
limited
community
who
did
not
naturally
come
in
the
austens
way
it
seems
obvious
to
link
the
two
allusions
together
and
if
this
is
correct
we
have
identified
one
of
the
admirers
of
our
heroine
more
serious
but
not
serious
was
the
attachment
between
her
and
lefroy
nephew
tom
lefroy
afterwards
chief
justice
of
ireland
which
is
mentioned
somewhat
cautiously
in
the
and
the
end
of
which
is
alluded
to
in
the
letter
already
quoted
the
young
people
became
acquainted
in
the
winter
of
and
took
to
each
other
from
the
first
in
a
lively
letter
to
cassandra
on
january
jane
describes
a
ball
at
manydown
h
eathcote
began
with
elizabeth
and
afterwards
danced
with
her
again
but
do
not
know
how
be
i
flatter
myself
however
that
they
will
profit
by
the
three
successive
lessons
which
i
have
given
them
you
scold
me
so
much
in
the
nice
long
letter
which
i
have
this
moment
received
from
you
that
i
am
almost
afraid
to
tell
you
how
my
irish
friend
and
i
behaved
imagine
to
yourself
everything
most
profligate
and
shocking
in
the
way
of
dancing
and
sitting
down
together
i
expose
myself
however
only
because
he
leaves
the
country
soon
after
next
friday
on
which
day
we
to
have
a
dance
at
ashe
after
all
he
is
a
very
gentlemanlike
pleasant
young
man
i
assure
you
but
as
to
our
having
ever
met
except
at
the
three
last
balls
i
can
not
say
much
for
he
is
so
excessively
laughed
at
about
me
at
ashe
that
he
is
ashamed
of
coming
to
steventon
and
ran
away
when
we
called
on
lefroy
a
few
days
ago
after
i
had
written
the
above
we
received
a
visit
from
tom
lefroy
and
his
cousin
george
the
latter
is
really
very
now
and
as
to
the
other
he
has
but
fault
which
time
will
i
trust
entirely
remove
it
is
that
his
morning
coat
is
a
great
deal
too
light
he
is
a
very
great
admirer
of
tom
jones
and
therefore
wears
the
same
coloured
clothes
i
imagine
which
did
when
he
was
wounded
a
few
days
later
she
is
writing
again
our
party
to
ashe
night
will
consist
of
edward
cooper
james
for
a
ball
is
nothing
without
buller
who
is
now
staying
with
us
and
i
look
forward
with
great
impatience
to
it
as
i
rather
expect
to
receive
an
offer
from
my
friend
in
the
course
of
the
evening
i
shall
refuse
him
however
unless
he
promises
to
give
away
his
white
coat
at
length
the
day
is
come
on
which
i
am
to
flirt
my
last
with
tom
lefroy
and
when
you
receive
this
it
will
be
over
my
tears
flow
as
i
write
at
the
melancholy
idea
truly
the
little
girl
of
twelve
had
made
considerable
progress
by
the
time
she
was
twenty
unfortunately
there
is
no
further
letter
to
tell
us
whether
tom
made
the
expected
proposal
or
not
but
it
is
pretty
certain
that
he
did
not
and
indeed
there
is
a
good
deal
of
doubt
whether
it
was
really
expected
possibly
lack
of
means
prevented
its
ever
being
a
serious
matter
on
his
side
they
can
never
have
met
again
on
the
same
intimate
terms
if
he
visited
ashe
at
all
in
the
conditions
must
have
been
different
for
he
was
by
that
time
tacitly
engaged
to
the
lady
whom
he
married
in
march
tom
lefroy
accordingly
disappears
from
jane
life
though
he
never
forgot
her
till
his
death
at
the
age
of
ninety
when
he
was
an
old
man
he
told
a
young
relation
that
had
been
in
love
with
jane
austen
but
it
was
a
love
as
for
jane
feelings
the
opinion
in
the
family
seems
to
have
been
that
it
was
a
disappointment
but
not
a
severe
one
had
it
been
severe
either
jane
would
not
have
joked
about
it
or
cassandra
would
have
destroyed
the
letters
but
the
day
of
jane
one
real
romance
was
still
to
come
a
romance
which
probably
affected
the
flow
of
her
spirits
and
helped
to
disincline
her
for
literary
composition
for
some
time
after
its
occurrence
in
this
case
as
in
the
other
the
author
of
the
was
rather
reticent
but
shortly
after
its
publication
his
sister
caroline
austen
was
induced
to
put
down
in
writing
the
facts
as
she
knew
them
no
one
could
be
better
qualified
to
do
this
for
she
was
a
person
of
great
ability
and
endowed
with
a
wonderfully
accurate
and
retentive
memory
it
will
be
seen
also
that
she
has
the
unimpeachable
authority
of
cassandra
to
support
her
we
can
therefore
feel
confidence
in
the
truth
of
the
story
although
date
place
and
even
the
name
of
the
gentleman
are
missing
caroline
austen
account
is
as
follows
all
that
i
know
is
this
at
newtown
aunt
cassandra
was
staying
with
us
with
the
writer
and
her
mother
james
austen
when
we
made
acquaintance
with
a
certain
of
the
engineers
he
was
very
pleasing
and
very
my
aunt
was
very
much
struck
with
him
and
was
struck
by
her
commendation
she
so
rarely
admired
strangers
afterwards
at
another
time
i
do
not
remember
exactly
when
she
spoke
of
him
as
of
one
so
unusually
gifted
with
all
that
was
agreeable
and
said
that
he
reminded
her
strongly
of
a
gentleman
whom
they
had
met
one
summer
when
they
were
by
the
sea
i
think
she
said
in
devonshire
i
do
think
she
named
the
place
and
i
am
sure
she
did
not
say
lyme
for
that
i
should
have
remembered
that
he
seemed
greatly
attracted
by
my
aunt
jane
i
suppose
it
was
an
intercourse
of
some
weeks
and
that
when
they
had
to
part
i
imagine
he
was
a
visitor
also
but
his
family
might
have
lived
near
he
was
urgent
to
know
where
they
would
be
the
next
summer
implying
or
perhaps
saying
that
he
should
be
there
also
wherever
it
might
be
i
can
only
say
that
the
impression
left
on
aunt
cassandra
was
that
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
sister
and
was
quite
in
earnest
soon
afterwards
they
heard
of
his
death
also
died
of
a
sudden
illness
soon
after
we
had
seen
him
at
newtown
and
i
suppose
it
was
that
coincidence
of
early
death
that
led
my
aunt
to
speak
of
him
the
unknown
at
all
i
am
sure
she
thought
he
was
worthy
of
her
sister
from
the
way
in
which
she
recalled
his
memory
and
also
that
she
did
not
doubt
either
that
he
would
have
been
a
successful
suitor
this
short
history
contains
all
the
facts
that
are
known
the
rest
must
be
left
to
imagination
but
of
two
things
we
may
be
sure
the
man
whom
cassandra
deemed
worthy
of
her
sister
can
have
been
no
ordinary
person
and
the
similarity
in
the
ending
of
romance
in
the
case
of
both
sisters
must
have
added
a
strong
link
of
sympathy
to
the
chain
of
love
which
bound
their
lives
together
a
story
is
given
in
the
of
sir
francis
to
the
effect
that
austen
accompanied
by
cassandra
and
jane
took
advantage
of
the
peace
of
amiens
in
to
undertake
a
foreign
tour
whilst
in
switzerland
they
fell
in
with
a
young
naval
officer
who
speedily
became
attached
to
jane
his
love
was
returned
and
all
seemed
to
be
going
smoothly
the
party
were
making
for
chamonix
but
while
the
austens
kept
to
such
high
road
as
there
was
their
friend
was
to
make
his
way
thither
over
the
mountains
the
austens
reached
chamonix
safely
but
their
friend
never
arrived
and
at
last
news
came
that
he
had
himself
and
died
of
brain
fever
on
the
way
the
austens
returned
to
england
and
jane
resumed
her
ordinary
life
never
referring
to
her
adventures
abroad
this
story
is
given
on
the
authority
of
a
miss
ursula
mayow
who
heard
it
thirty
or
forty
years
later
from
a
niece
of
jane
austen
who
this
niece
was
we
do
not
know
but
she
can
not
have
been
either
of
the
two
who
were
grown
up
before
their
aunt
death
for
they
knew
nothing
of
any
such
journey
as
it
stands
the
story
is
impossible
for
many
reasons
we
give
three
such
an
important
and
unusual
event
as
a
tour
in
switzerland
could
not
have
taken
place
without
leaving
traces
behind
and
there
is
no
shadow
of
a
tradition
of
it
remaining
in
the
family
they
could
not
possibly
have
afforded
it
george
austen
had
given
up
his
living
and
was
hoping
to
have
a
year
as
a
maximum
for
the
family
party
of
four
persons
and
they
had
just
had
the
expense
of
setting
up
house
in
bath
we
can
almost
prove
an
alibi
we
know
that
they
were
at
dawlish
in
the
year
of
the
peace
of
amiens
and
they
certainly
could
not
have
made
another
lengthened
absence
the
story
however
is
interesting
for
it
fits
in
so
far
as
its
main
theme
is
concerned
with
the
authentic
account
given
above
of
romance
in
the
west
although
the
setting
is
completely
different
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
fiction
originated
in
an
incorrect
account
or
of
the
true
tale
mixed
up
with
the
fact
mentioned
below
that
the
henry
austens
went
abroad
at
this
time
one
more
incident
shall
be
narrated
an
incident
which
though
full
of
discomfort
and
inconvenience
for
the
actors
yet
lacks
the
note
of
tragedy
contained
in
the
last
it
rests
on
the
same
excellent
authority
with
the
additional
safeguard
that
caroline
austen
own
mother
must
have
known
the
circumstances
exactly
the
story
is
as
follows
in
november
cassandra
and
jane
came
from
bath
to
pay
a
visit
to
their
old
home
then
in
the
possession
of
their
eldest
brother
james
and
his
wife
mary
in
the
course
of
it
they
went
to
spend
a
few
days
with
some
old
friends
in
the
neighbourhood
on
the
morning
of
friday
december
they
suddenly
reappeared
their
friends
having
driven
them
back
at
an
moment
all
got
out
and
to
james
surprise
a
tender
scene
of
embraces
and
tears
and
distressing
farewells
took
place
in
the
hall
no
sooner
had
the
carriage
disappeared
than
cassandra
and
jane
without
offering
any
explanation
turned
to
her
and
said
that
they
must
at
once
go
back
to
bath
the
very
next
day
it
was
absolutely
necessary
and
as
an
escort
for
young
ladies
travelling
by
coach
was
also
necessary
their
brother
james
must
take
them
although
saturday
was
a
day
on
which
it
was
most
inconvenient
for
a
rector
to
go
far
from
his
parish
for
he
could
not
return
till
monday
and
there
was
hardly
any
time
to
provide
for
his
sunday
duty
but
cassandra
and
jane
in
a
manner
very
unlike
their
usual
considerate
selves
refused
to
remain
till
monday
nor
would
they
give
any
reason
for
this
refusal
james
was
therefore
obliged
to
yield
and
to
go
with
them
to
bath
in
course
of
time
the
mystery
was
solved
one
of
the
family
with
whom
they
had
been
staying
had
made
jane
an
offer
of
marriage
which
she
accepted
only
to
repent
of
her
action
deeply
before
many
hours
had
passed
her
niece
caroline
remarks
are
as
follows
i
conjecture
that
the
advantages
he
could
offer
and
her
gratitude
for
his
love
and
her
long
friendship
with
his
family
induced
my
aunt
to
decide
that
she
would
marry
him
when
he
should
ask
her
but
that
having
accepted
him
she
found
she
was
miserable
to
be
sure
she
should
not
have
said
overnight
but
i
have
always
respected
her
for
her
courage
in
cancelling
that
the
next
morning
all
worldly
advantages
would
have
been
to
her
and
she
was
of
an
age
to
know
this
quite
well
she
was
nearly
my
aunts
had
very
small
fortunes
and
on
their
death
they
and
their
mother
would
be
they
were
aware
but
poorly
off
i
believe
most
young
women
so
circumstanced
would
have
gone
on
trusting
to
love
after
marriage
if
this
event
occurred
after
the
more
romantic
incident
in
the
west
of
england
it
is
possible
that
jane
had
hardly
as
yet
regained
her
wonted
balance
of
mind
and
calmness
of
judgment
we
have
no
further
tale
of
the
sort
to
tell
as
time
went
on
she
acquiesced
cheerfully
in
the
gradual
disappearance
of
youth
she
did
not
eschew
balls
but
was
indifferent
whether
she
was
asked
to
dance
or
not
was
the
same
room
in
which
we
danced
fifteen
years
ago
i
thought
it
all
over
and
in
spite
of
the
shame
of
being
so
much
older
felt
with
thankfulness
that
i
was
quite
as
happy
now
as
then
you
will
not
expect
to
hear
that
was
asked
to
dance
but
i
was
she
was
to
spend
the
remainder
of
her
life
in
the
centre
of
family
interests
and
by
degrees
to
become
engrossed
in
the
exciting
business
of
authorship
she
could
afford
to
laugh
at
the
suggestion
that
she
should
marry
the
rector
of
chawton
and
promise
to
do
so
whatever
his
reluctance
or
her
own
she
retained
to
the
end
her
freshness
and
humour
her
sympathy
with
the
young
do
not
grow
older
of
course
she
says
in
one
of
her
latest
letters
and
it
is
evident
that
this
was
the
impression
left
with
the
rising
generation
of
nephews
and
nieces
from
their
intercourse
with
her
footnotes
all
the
letters
in
this
volume
from
jane
to
cassandra
as
to
the
source
of
which
no
statement
is
made
are
quoted
from
lord
collection
pp
cadbury
is
the
correct
name
of
the
parish
the
blackall
family
had
been
established
and
respected
in
devonshire
since
the
episcopate
of
their
ancestor
offspring
blackall
bishop
of
exeter
in
the
time
of
queen
anne
our
sam
blackall
an
uncle
of
the
same
name
had
preceded
him
as
fellow
of
emmanuel
was
of
the
bishop
he
became
fellow
and
was
ordained
in
took
the
living
of
north
cadbury
in
and
lived
until
his
college
record
which
we
owe
to
the
courtesy
of
the
fellows
corresponds
very
well
with
our
notices
of
him
he
was
evidently
a
sociable
and
lively
member
of
the
the
contains
frequent
mention
of
bets
made
by
him
on
politics
and
other
subjects
and
his
own
particular
pair
of
bowls
still
survive
he
was
tutor
in
when
a
great
fire
occurred
in
the
college
and
took
his
share
in
appealing
for
funds
with
which
to
rebuild
it
application
being
chiefly
made
to
those
who
agreed
with
the
college
politics
in
church
and
state
he
seems
to
have
been
one
of
a
large
family
of
brothers
another
being
john
blackall
of
balliol
college
oxford
for
many
years
a
distinguished
exeter
physician
who
did
not
die
until
heathcote
and
miss
elizabeth
bigg
were
married
in
miss
hill
following
a
family
calls
but
it
seems
from
what
has
been
said
above
that
the
confused
two
different
men
certainly
cassandra
in
telling
the
story
to
her
niece
caroline
did
not
give
her
that
or
any
other
name
for
caroline
speaks
of
the
tale
as
being
so
far
as
she
knew
it
and
dateless
a
possible
alternative
suggestion
is
that
there
were
two
blackalls
concerned
one
being
the
sam
blackall
mentioned
above
the
other
jane
austen
admirer
in
the
west
of
england
the
author
of
the
describes
this
gentleman
as
one
who
had
the
recommendations
of
good
character
and
connexions
and
position
in
life
of
everything
in
fact
except
the
subtle
power
of
touching
her
heart
chapter
vii
authorship
and
correspondence
the
appearance
of
jane
austen
name
among
the
list
of
subscribers
to
madame
in
marks
the
beginning
of
her
literary
career
her
father
must
have
paid
the
necessary
subscription
for
her
and
he
probably
did
so
believing
that
his
daughter
talent
deserved
encouragement
jane
cousins
the
cookes
of
bookham
were
some
of
madame
closest
friends
while
the
latter
was
living
in
that
neighbourhood
from
to
and
it
is
quite
likely
that
they
were
active
in
getting
subscribers
one
likes
to
think
that
as
miss
hill
has
suggested
jane
may
have
met
madame
when
paying
a
visit
to
bookham
jane
was
destined
to
have
two
periods
of
active
authorship
periods
of
unequal
length
and
divided
from
each
other
by
eight
or
ten
nearly
barren
years
this
unfruitful
time
has
been
accounted
for
in
several
different
ways
as
arising
from
personal
griefs
literary
disappointment
or
want
of
a
settled
home
these
disturbing
causes
all
existed
and
it
is
probable
that
each
contributed
its
share
to
her
unwillingness
to
write
but
at
present
she
enjoyed
hope
and
happiness
the
vigour
and
cheerfulness
of
youth
among
congenial
companions
and
a
home
as
yet
unvisited
by
any
acute
sorrows
no
precise
date
has
been
assigned
to
the
writing
of
and
but
after
the
completion
of
that
sketch
her
time
has
been
fully
mapped
out
as
follows
original
of
and
begun
october
ended
august
and
begun
november
probably
called
written
in
and
it
has
been
usual
to
dwell
on
the
precocity
of
intellect
shown
in
the
composition
of
the
first
two
of
these
works
by
a
young
and
inexperienced
girl
and
no
doubt
there
is
much
justice
in
the
observation
but
we
venture
to
think
that
it
is
in
that
we
get
the
best
example
of
what
she
could
produce
at
the
age
of
or
in
the
two
others
the
revision
they
underwent
before
publication
was
so
complete
that
it
is
impossible
now
to
separate
the
earlier
from
the
later
work
whereas
in
while
there
is
good
evidence
from
the
author
preface
of
a
careful
preparation
for
the
press
before
she
sold
it
in
there
is
no
mention
of
any
radical
alteration
at
a
subsequent
date
on
the
contrary
she
apologises
for
what
may
seem
in
the
social
arrangements
of
the
story
by
alleging
the
length
of
time
that
had
elapsed
since
its
completion
there
is
internal
evidence
to
the
same
effect
she
has
not
quite
shaken
off
the
tendency
to
satirise
contemporary
extravagances
and
it
is
not
until
several
chapters
are
past
that
she
settles
herself
down
to
any
serious
creation
of
characters
the
superiority
also
in
interest
and
fun
of
the
first
volume
over
the
second
though
no
doubt
inherent
in
the
scheme
of
the
story
is
a
defect
which
she
would
hardly
have
tolerated
at
a
later
date
nevertheless
we
think
her
admirers
may
be
satisfied
with
this
example
of
her
youthful
style
the
charm
with
which
she
manages
to
invest
a
simple
ingenuous
girl
like
catherine
the
brightness
of
henry
tilney
even
the
shallowness
of
isabella
and
the
boorishness
of
john
thorpe
are
things
we
part
from
with
regret
and
in
parting
with
our
friends
at
the
end
of
one
of
her
novels
we
part
with
them
for
good
and
all
they
never
in
another
shape
elsewhere
even
allen
and
lady
bertram
are
by
no
means
the
same
it
seems
to
have
been
only
a
happy
accident
though
no
doubt
an
accident
very
likely
to
occur
which
prevented
from
appearing
in
its
immature
shape
george
austen
was
ready
and
indeed
anxious
that
his
daughter
work
should
be
published
and
when
she
had
finished
the
story
in
august
he
took
steps
to
find
a
publisher
years
afterwards
probably
in
at
the
sale
of
the
effects
of
cadell
the
famous
london
publisher
the
following
letter
was
purchased
by
a
connexion
of
the
family
sir
i
have
in
my
possession
a
manuscript
novel
comprising
about
the
length
of
miss
burney
as
i
am
well
aware
of
what
consequence
it
is
that
a
work
of
this
sort
make
its
first
appearance
under
a
respectable
name
i
apply
to
you
i
shall
be
much
obliged
therefore
if
you
will
inform
me
whether
you
choose
to
be
concerned
in
it
what
will
be
the
expense
of
publishing
it
at
the
author
risk
and
what
you
will
venture
to
advance
for
the
property
of
it
if
on
perusal
it
is
approved
of
should
you
give
any
encouragement
i
will
send
you
the
work

humble

this
proposal
we
are
told
was
declined
by
return
of

the
earliest
of
jane
letters
which
have
survived
date
from
the
year
they
begin
at

middle
of
their
winter
engagements

saturday
january
in
the

place
i
hope
you
will
live
years
longer
tom
birthday
was
yesterday
so
that
you
are
very
near
of
an
age
after
this
necessary
preamble
i
shall
proceed
to
inform
you
that
we
had
an
exceeding
good
ball
last
night
and
that
i
was
very
much
disappointed
at
not
seeing
charles
fowle
of
the
party
as
i
had
previously
heard
of
his
being
invited
we
were
so
terrible
good
as
to
take
james
in
our
carriage
though
there
were
three
of
us
before
but
indeed
he
deserves
encouragement
for
the
very
great
improvement
which
has
lately
taken
place
in
his
dancing
miss
heathcote
is
pretty
but
not
near
so
handsome
as
i
expected
henry
is
still
hankering
after
the
regulars
and
as
his
project
of
purchasing
the
adjutancy
of
the
oxfordshire
is
now
over
he
has
got
a
scheme
in
his
head
about
getting
a
lieutenancy
and
adjutancy
in
the
a
regiment
which
he
fancies
will
be
ordered
to
the
cape
of
good
hope
i
heartily
hope
that
he
will
as
usual
be
disappointed
in
this
scheme

thursday
january
i
am
very
much
flattered
by
your
commendation
of
my
last
letter
for
i
write
only
for
fame
and
without
any
view
to
pecuniary
emolument

mary
that
i
make
over
heartley
and
all
his
estate
to
her
for
her
sole
use
and
benefit
in
future
and
not
only
him
but
all
my
other
admirers
into
the
bargain
wherever
she
can
find
them
even
the
kiss
which
powlett
wanted
to
give
me
as
i
mean
to
confine
myself
in
future
to
tom
lefroy
for
whom
i
do
care
sixpence
assure
her
also
as
a
last
and
indubitable
proof
of
warren
indifference
to
me
that
he
actually
drew
that
gentleman
picture
for
me
and
delivered
it
to
me
without
a
sigh
the
next
batch
of
letters
date
from
a
visit
paid
by
jane
in
august
to
rowling
the
kent
home
of
her
brother
edward
she
seems
to
have
experienced
a
difficulty
in
finding
an
escort
for
her
return
journey
henry
kept
changing
his
plans
and
frank
the
sailor
was
liable
to
be
sent
for
at
a
day
notice
she
had
evidently
been
studying
her
copy
of
cork
street
tuesday
morn
august
my
dear
cassandra
here
i
am
once
more
in
this
scene
of
dissipation
and
vice
and
i
begin
already
to
find
my
morals
corrupted
we
reached
staines
yesterday
i
do
not
know
when
without
suffering
so
much
from
the
heat
as
i
had
hoped
to
do
we
set
off
again
this
morning
at
seven
and
had
a
very
pleasant
drive
as
the
morning
was
cloudy
and
perfectly
cool
i
came
all
the
way
in
the
chaise
from
hartford
bridge
edward
and
frank
are
both
gone
out
to
seek
their
fortunes
the
latter
is
to
return
soon
and
help
us
seek
ours
the
former
we
shall
never
see
again
we
are
to
be
at
astley
which
i
am
glad
of
edward
has
heard
from
henry
this
morning
he
has
not
been
at
the
races
at
all
unless
his
driving
miss
pearson
over
to
rowling
one
day
can
be
so
called
we
shall
find
him
there
on
thursday
i
hope
you
are
all
alive
after
our
melancholy
parting
yesterday
and
that
you
pursued
your
intended
avocation
with
success
god
bless
you
i
must
leave
off
for
we
are
going
out
yours
very
affectionately
austen
everybody
love
rowling
thursday
september
my
dearest
cassandra
the
letter
which
i
have
this
moment
received
from
you
has
diverted
me
beyond
moderation
i
could
die
of
laughter
at
it
as
they
used
to
say
at
school
you
are
indeed
the
finest
comic
writer
of
the
present
age
i
am
sorry
that
you
found
such
a
conciseness
in
the
strains
of
my
first
letter
i
must
endeavour
to
make
you
amends
for
it
when
we
meet
by
some
elaborate
details
which
i
shall
shortly
begin
composing
our
men
had
but
indifferent
weather
for
their
visit
to
godmersham
for
it
rained
great
part
of
the
way
there
and
all
the
way
back
they
found
knight
remarkably
well
and
in
very
good
spirits
it
is
imagined
that
she
will
shortly
be
married
again
i
have
taken
little
george
once
in
my
arms
since
i
have
been
here
which
i
thought
very
kind
i
shall
be
just
like
camilla
in
dubster
for
my
lionel
will
have
taken
away
the
ladder
by
which
i
came
here
or
at
least
by
which
i
intended
to
get
away
and
here
i
must
stay
till
his
return
my
situation
however
is
somewhat
preferable
to
hers
for
i
am
very
happy
here
though
i
should
be
glad
to
get
home
by
the
end
of
the
month
i
have
no
idea
that
miss
pearson
will
return
with
me
what
a
fine
fellow
charles
is
to
deceive
us
into
writing
two
letters
to
him
at
cork
i
admire
his
ingenuity
extremely
especially
as
he
is
so
great
a
gainer
by
it
i
am
glad
to
hear
so
good
an
account
of
charde
and
only
fear
that
my
long
absence
may
occasion
his
relapse
i
practise
every
day
as
much
as
i
can
i
wish
it
were
more
for
his
sake
frank
has
turned
a
very
nice
little
for
fanny
i
do
not
believe
that
any
of
the
party
were
aware
of
the
valuables
they
had
left
behind
nor
can
i
hear
anything
of
anna
gloves
indeed
i
have
not
enquired
at
all
about
them
hitherto
we
are
very
busy
making
edward
shirts
and
i
am
proud
to
say
that
i
am
the
neatest
worker
of
the
party
rowling
monday
september
my
dear
cassandra
i
shall
be
extremely
anxious
to
hear
the
event
of
your
ball
and
shall
hope
to
receive
so
long
and
minute
an
account
of
every
particular
that
i
shall
be
tired
of
reading
it
i
hope
john
lovett
accident
will
not
prevent
his
attending
the
ball
as
you
will
otherwise
be
obliged
to
dance
with
tincton
the
whole
evening
let
me
know
how
harwood
deports
himself
without
the
miss
biggs
and
which
of
the
marys
will
carry
the
day
with
my
brother
james
were
at
a
ball
on
saturday
i
assure
you
we
dined
at
goodnestone
and
in
the
evening
danced
two
and
the
boulangeries
i
opened
the
ball
with
edward
bridges
the
other
couples
were
lewis
cage
and
harriet
frank
and
louisa
fanny
and
george
elizabeth
played
one
lady
bridges
the
other
which
she
made
henry
dance
with
her
and
miss
finch
played
the
boulangeries
in
reading
over
the
last
three
or
four
lines
i
am
aware
of
my
having
expressed
myself
in
so
doubtful
a
manner
that
if
i
did
not
tell
you
to
the
contrary
you
might
imagine
it
was
lady
bridges
who
made
henry
dance
with
her
at
the
same
time
that
she
was
playing
which
if
not
impossible
must
appear
a
very
improbable
event
to
you
but
it
was
elizabeth
who
danced
we
supped
there
and
walked
home
at
night
under
the
shade
of
two
umbrellas
we
have
just
got
some
venison
from
godmersham
which
the
two
harveys
are
to
devour
and
on
friday
or
saturday
the
goodnestone
people
are
to
finish
their
scraps
henry
went
away
on
friday
as
he
purposed
you
will
hear
from
him
soon
i
imagine
as
he
talked
of
writing
to
steventon
shortly
richard
harvey
is
going
to
be
married
but
as
it
is
a
great
secret
and
only
known
to
half
the
neighbourhood
you
must
not
mention
it
the
lady
name
is
musgrave
pray
remember
me
to
everybody
who
does
not
enquire
after
me
those
who
do
remember
me
without
bidding
give
my
love
to
mary
harrison
and
tell
her
i
wish
whenever
she
is
attached
to
a
young
man
some
marchmont
may
keep
them
apart
for
five
volumes
rowling
thursday
september
at
nackington
we
met
lady
sondes
picture
over
the
mantelpiece
in
the
and
the
pictures
of
her
three
children
in
an
besides
scott
miss
fletcher
toke
toke
and
the
archdeacon
lynch
miss
fletcher
and
i
were
very
thick
but
i
am
the
thinnest
of
the
two
she
wore
her
purple
muslin
which
is
pretty
enough
though
it
does
not
become
her
complexion
there
are
two
traits
in
her
character
which
are
pleasing
namely
she
admires
and
drinks
no
cream
in
her
tea
if
you
should
ever
see
lucy
you
may
tell
her
that
i
scolded
miss
fletcher
for
her
negligence
in
writing
as
she
desired
me
to
do
but
without
being
able
to
bring
her
to
any
proper
sense
of
shame
that
miss
fletcher
says
in
her
defence
that
as
everybody
whom
lucy
knew
when
she
was
in
canterbury
has
now
left
it
she
has
nothing
at
all
to
write
to
her
about
by
i
suppose
miss
fletcher
means
that
a
new
set
of
officers
have
arrived
there
but
this
is
a
note
of
my
own
his
royal
highness
sir
thomas
williams
has
at
length
sailed
the
papers
say
a
cruise
but
i
hope
they
are
gone
to
cork
or
i
shall
have
written
in
vain
give
my
love
to
jane
as
she
arrived
at
steventon
yesterday
i
dare
say
edward
and
frank
went
out
yesterday
very
early
in
a
couple
of
shooting
jackets
and
came
home
like
a
couple
of
bad
shots
for
they
killed
nothing
at
all
they
are
out
again
and
are
not
yet
returned
delightful
sport
they
are
just
come
home
edward
with
his
two
brace
frank
with
his
two
and
a
half
what
amiable
young
men
rowling
sunday
september
this
morning
has
been
spent
in
doubt
and
deliberation
in
forming
plans
and
removing
difficulties
for
it
ushered
in
the
day
with
an
event
which
i
had
not
intended
should
take
place
so
soon
by
a
week
frank
has
received
his
appointment
on
board
the
john
commanded
by
the
triton
and
will
therefore
be
obliged
to
be
in
town
on
wednesday
and
though
i
have
every
disposition
in
the
world
to
accompany
him
on
that
day
i
can
not
go
on
the
uncertainty
of
the
pearsons
being
at
home
as
i
should
not
have
a
place
to
go
to
in
case
they
were
from
home
my
father
will
be
so
good
as
to
fetch
home
his
prodigal
daughter
from
town
i
hope
unless
he
wishes
me
to
walk
the
hospitals
enter
at
the
temple
or
mount
guard
at
james
it
will
hardly
be
in
frank
power
to
take
me
home
nay
it
certainly
will
not
i
shall
write
again
as
soon
as
i
get
to
greenwich
i
am
very
glad
that
the
idea
of
returning
with
frank
occurred
to
me
for
as
to
henry
coming
into
kent
again
the
time
of
its
taking
place
is
so
very
uncertain
that
i
should
be
waiting
for
men
i
had
once
determined
to
go
with
frank
and
take
my
chance
but
they
dissuaded
me
from
so
rash
a
step
as
i
really
think
on
consideration
it
would
have
been
for
if
the
pearsons
were
not
at
home
i
should
inevitably
fall
a
sacrifice
to
the
arts
of
some
fat
woman
who
would
make
me
drunk
with
small
beer
in
some
way
or
other
jane
managed
to
reach
steventon
and
at
once
set
to
work
on
from
that
point
the
letters
cease
for
two
years
namely
till
october
several
family
events
occurred
during
the
interval
in
january
came
the
wedding
of
james
austen
and
mary
lloyd
owing
to
the
friendship
which
had
long
existed
between
the
austens
and
the
lloyds
this
marriage
gave
great
pleasure
at
steventon
and
eliza
de
feuillide
remarks
on
it
as
follows
james
has
chosen
a
second
wife
in
the
person
of
miss
mary
lloyd
who
is
not
either
rich
or
handsome
but
very
sensible
and
good
humoured
jane
seems
much
pleased
with
the
match
and
it
is
natural
she
should
having
long
known
and
liked
the
lady
not
long
after
this
happy
event
the
rectory
at
steventon
was
plunged
into
deep
grief
for
news
came
that
cassandra
intended
husband
thomas
fowle
who
was
expected
home
from
domingo
in
a
few
weeks
had
died
in
february
of
yellow
fever
our
chief
informant
is
again
eliza
de
feuillide
who
writes
on
may
this
is
a
very
severe
stroke
to
the
whole
family
and
particularly
to
poor
cassandra
for
whom
i
feel
more
than
i
can
express
indeed
i
am
most
sincerely
grieved
at
this
event
and
the
pain
which
it
must
occasion
our
worthy
relations
jane
says
that
her
sister
behaves
with
a
degree
of
resolution
and
propriety
which
no
common
mind
could
evince
in
so
trying
a
situation
his
kinsman
lord
craven
who
had
taken
him
out
as
chaplain
to
his
regiment
said
afterwards
that
had
he
known
of
his
engagement
he
would
not
have
allowed
him
to
go
to
so
dangerous
a
climate
after
such
a
blow
as
this
jane
was
hardly
likely
to
leave
cassandra
and
the
absence
of
letters
at
this
time
is
easily
understood
in
november
of
this
same
year
austen
whose
health
was
not
good
determined
to
go
to
bath
with
her
daughters
the
route
from
steventon
was
by
andover
and
devizes
one
night
being
usually
spent
at
the
latter
place
austen
brother
leigh
perrot
was
a
regular
visitor
to
bath
and
there
is
every
reason
to
suppose
that
jane
had
already
visited
the
leigh
perrots
or
the
coopers
or
both
at
this
still
fashionable
resort
whose
place
was
only
gradually
being
usurped
by
brighton
owing
to
the
absence
of
contemporary
letters
our
knowledge
of
her
stay
there
in
is
chiefly
derived
from
reminiscences
in
later
correspondence
thus
in
may
when
visiting
bath
again
jane
remarks
that
it
rained
almost
all
the
way
from
devizes
our
first
view
of
bath
has
been
just
as
gloomy
as
it
was
last
november
we
may
therefore
imagine
them
bath
on
a
wet
afternoon
like
lady
russell
in
driving
through
the
long
course
of
streets
amidst
the
dash
of
other
carriages
the
heavy
rumble
of
carts
and
drays
the
bawling
of
newsmen
and
milkmen
and
the
ceaseless
clink
of
pattens
the
austens
probably
stayed
with
the
perrots
at
their
house
no
paragon
buildings
writing
in
april
jane
describes
a
visit
to
a
and
says
years
and
four
months
ago
we
went
to
the
same
to
see
miss
lefroy
performance
what
a
different
set
are
we
now
moving
in
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
in
what
way
the
set
differed
whether
in
kind
or
only
in
the
individuals
composing
it
in
this
earlier
visit
jane
was
likely
to
have
seen
plenty
of
company
as
the
leigh
perrots
had
a
large
acquaintance
the
austens
stayed
at
bath
into
december
for
elizabeth
de
feuillide
mentions
on
december
that
she
had
heard
very
lately
from
jane
is
still
at
bath
with
her
mother
and
sister
hampson
whom
i
saw
yesterday
told
me
he
had
heard
cassandra
was
going
to
be
married
but
jane
says
not
a
word
of
it
when
we
think
of
jane
silence
and
still
more
of
cassandra
recent
grief
we
may
safely
discredit
this
extremely
improbable
rumour
on
returning
home
for
christmas
they
received
a
piece
of
news
which
even
if
it
did
not
come
entirely
as
a
surprise
can
hardly
have
given
unmixed
pleasure
this
was
the
engagement
of
henry
austen
to
his
cousin
eliza
de
feuillide
his
senior
by
some
ten
years
intended
originally
for
the
church
henry
austen
had
abandoned
the
idea
of
taking
orders
and
had
joined
the
oxford
militia
as
lieutenant
in
becoming
adjutant
and
captain
four
years
later
though
he
was
endowed
with
many
attractive
gifts
there
was
a
certain
infirmity
of
purpose
in
his
character
that
was
hardly
likely
to
be
remedied
by
a
marriage
to
his
very
cousin
in
default
of
eliza
letter
on
the
occasion
to
her
uncle
we
may
quote
that
which
she
wrote
to
warren
hastings
dear
sir
as
i
flatter
myself
you
still
take
an
interest
in
my
welfare
i
think
it
incumbent
on
me
to
acquaint
you
with
a
circumstance
by
which
it
must
be
materially
influenced
i
have
consented
to
an
union
with
my
cousin
captain
austen
who
has
the
honour
of
being
known
to
you
he
has
been
for
some
time
in
possession
of
a
comfortable
income
and
the
excellence
of
his
heart
temper
and
understanding
together
with
steady
attachment
to
me
his
affection
for
my
little
boy
and
disinterested
concurrence
in
the
disposal
of
my
property
in
favour
of
this
latter
have
at
length
induced
me
to
an
acquiescence
which
i
have
withheld
for
more
than
two
years
need
i
say
my
dear
sir
that
i
most
earnestly
wish
for
your
approbation
on
this
occasion
and
that
it
is
with
the
sincerest
attachment
i
shall
ever
remain
your
much
obliged
and
affectionate
elizabeth
de
feuillide
i
beg
leave
to
present
my
affectionate
compliments
to
hastings
december
neither
side
wished
for
a
long
engagement
and
they
were
married
on
december
henry
continued
with
the
militia
regiment
probably
till
the
peace
of
by
he
had
joined
a
brother
militia
officer
of
the
name
of
maunde
and
set
up
as
banker
and
army
agent
with
offices
in
albany
piccadilly
removing
in
or
before
to
henrietta
street
covent
garden
poor
little
hastings
de
feuillide
became
subject
to
epilepsy
and
died
on
october
while
the
henry
austens
were
living
in
upper
berkeley
street
during
the
first
half
of
jane
fresh
from
her
late
visit
to
bath
was
able
to
devote
some
happy
months
of
unbroken
leisure
to
writing
the
first
draft
of
the
book
known
to
us
as
but
her
comedy
was

so
frequent

that

been

some
change
after
this
shock
must
have
been
desirable
and
at
the
end
of
the
same
month
and
austen
with
cassandra
and
jane
started
on
a
visit
to
the
edward

no
longer
at
rowling
but
at
godmersham
which
by
the
generosity
of

was
now
become

residence
edward
would
naturally
wish
for
a
visit
from
his
parents
and

in

new
and
beautiful
home
we
know
very
little
of
jane
doings
there
except
that
she
attended
a
ball
at
ashford
but
on
her
parting
from
cassandra
who
was
left
behind
and
returning
to
steventon
with
her
father
and

we
find
ourselves
fortunately
in
the
company
of
the
letters
once
more
austen
was
at
this
time
in
poor
health
and
jane
evidently
felt
the
responsibility
of
taking
charge

wednesday
october
my
dear
cassandra
you
have
already
heard
from
daniel
i
conclude
in
what
excellent
time
we
reached
and
quitted
sittingbourne
and
how
very
well
my
mother
bore
her
journey
thither
i
am
now
able
to
send
you
a
continuation
of
the
same
good
account
of
her
she
was
very
little
fatigued
on
her
arrival
at
this
place
has
been
refreshed
by
a
comfortable
dinner
and
now
seems
quite
stout
it
wanted
five
minutes
of
twelve
when
we
left
sittingbourne
from
whence
we
had
a
famous
pair
of
horses
which
took
us
to
rochester
in
an
hour
and
a
quarter
the
postboy
seemed
determined
to
show
my
mother
that
kentish
drivers
were
not
always
tedious
and
really
drove
as
fast
as
our
next
stage
was
not
quite
so
expeditiously
performed
the
load
was
heavy
and
our
horses
very
indifferent
however
we
were
in
such
good
time
and
my
mother
bore
her
journey
so
well
that
expedition
was
of
little
importance
to
us
and
as
it
was
we
were
very
little
more
than
two
hours
and
a
half
coming
hither
and
it
was
scarcely
past
four
when
we
stopped
at
the
inn
i
should
have
begun
my
letter
soon
after
our
arrival
but
for
a
little
adventure
which
prevented
me
after
we
had
been
here
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
was
discovered
that
my
writing
and
dressing
boxes
had
been
by
accident
put
into
a
chaise
which
was
just
packing
off
as
we
came
in
and
were
driven
away
towards
gravesend
in
their
way
to
the
west
indies
no
part
of
my
property
could
have
been
such
a
prize
before
for
in
my
writing
box
was
all
my
worldly
wealth
and
my
dear
deputation
nottley
immediately
despatched
a
man
and
horse
after
the
chaise
and
in
half
an
hour
time
i
had
the
pleasure
of
being
as
rich
as
ever
they
were
got
about
two
or
three
miles
off
my
day
journey
has
been
pleasanter
in
every
respect
than
i
expected
i
have
been
very
little
crowded
and
by
no
means
unhappy
your
watchfulness
with
regard
to
the
weather
on
our
accounts
was
very
kind
and
very
effectual
we
had
one
heavy
shower
on
leaving
sittingbourne
but
afterwards
the
clouds
cleared
away
and
we
had
a
very
bright
afternoon
my
father
is
now
reading
the
which
he
has
got
from
the
library
and
mother
sitting
by
the
fire
our
route
is
not
determined
we
have
none
of
us
much
inclination
for
london
and
if
nottley
will
give
us
leave
i
think
we
shall
go
to
staines
through
croydon
and
kingston
which
will
be
much
pleasanter
than
any
other
way
but
he
is
decidedly
for
clapham
and
battersea
god
bless
you
all
yours
affectionately
j
i
flatter
myself
that
will
not
forget
me
at
least
under
a
week
kiss
him
for
me
steventon
saturday
october
we
arrived
here
yesterday
between
four
and
five
but
i
can
not
send
you
quite
so
triumphant
an
account
of
our
last
day
journey
as
of
the
first
and
second
soon
after
i
had
finished
my
letter
from
staines
my
mother
began
to
suffer
from
the
exercise
or
fatigue
of
travelling
and
she
was
a
good
deal
indisposed
james
called
on
us
just
as
we
were
going
to
tea
and
my
mother
was
well
enough
to
talk
very
cheerfully
to
him
before
she
went
to
bed
they
james
and
mary
were
to
have
dined
here
but
the
weather
is
too
bad
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
that
martha
is
with
them
james
fetched
her
from
ibthorp
on
thursday
and
she
will
stay
with
them
till
she
removes
to
kintbury
i
am
very
grand
indeed
i
had
the
dignity
of
dropping
out
my
mother
laudanum
last
night
i
carry
about
the
keys
of
the
wine
and
closet
and
twice
since
i
began
this
letter
have
had
orders
to
give
in
the
kitchen
our
dinner
was
very
good
yesterday
and
the
chicken
boiled
perfectly
tender
therefore
i
shall
not
be
obliged
to
dismiss
nanny
on
that
account
your
letter
was
chaperoned
here
by
one
from
cooke
in
which
she
says
that
is
not
to
come
out
before
january
and
she
is
so
little
satisfied
with
cawthorn
dilatoriness
that
she
never
means
to
employ
him
again
hall
of
sherborne
was
brought
to
bed
yesterday
of
a
dead
child
some
weeks
before
she
expected
owing
to
a
fright
i
suppose
she
happened
unawares
to
look
at
her
husband
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
rain
here
for
this
last
fortnight
much
more
than
in
kent
and
indeed
we
found
the
roads
all
the
way
from
staines
most
disgracefully
dirty
steventon
lane
has
its
full
share
of
it
and
i
do
know
when
i
shall
be
able
to
get
to
deane
my
dear
remembrance
of
me
is
very
pleasing
to
me
foolishly
pleasing
because
i
know
it
will
be
over
so
soon
my
attachment
to
him
will
be
more
durable
i
shall
think
with
tenderness
and
delight
on
his
beautiful
and
smiling
countenance
and
interesting
manner
until
a
few
years
have
turned
him
into
an
ungovernable
ungracious
fellow
the
books
from
winton
are
all
unpacked
and
put
away
the
binding
has
compressed
them
most
conveniently
and
there
is
now
very
good
room
in
the
bookcase
for
all
that
we
wish
to
have
there
i
believe
the
servants
were
all
very
glad
to
see
us
nanny
was
i
am
sure
she
confesses
that
it
was
very
dull
and
yet
she
had
her
child
with
her
till
last
sunday
i
understand
that
there
are
some
grapes
left
but
i
believe
not
many
they
must
be
gathered
as
soon
as
possible
or
this
rain
will
entirely
rot
them
saturday
november
my
mother
desires
me
to
tell
you
that
i
am
a
very
good
housekeeper
which
i
have
no
reluctance
in
doing
because
i
really
think
it
my
peculiar
excellence
and
for
this
reason
i
always
take
care
to
provide
such
things
as
please
my
own
appetite
which
i
consider
as
the
chief
merit
in
housekeeping
i
have
had
some
ragout
veal
and
i
mean
to
have
some
haricot
mutton
we
are
to
kill
a
pig
soon
there
is
to
be
a
ball
at
basingstoke
next
thursday
our
assemblies
have
very
kindly
declined
ever
since
we
laid
down
the
carriage
so
that
and
to
go
have
kept
pace
together
i
have
just
received
a
note
from
james
to
say
that
mary
was
brought
to
bed
last
night
at
eleven
of
a
fine
little
boy
and
that
everything
is
going
on
very
well
my
mother
had
desired
to
know
nothing
of
it
before
it
should
be
all
over
and
we
were
clever
enough
to
prevent
her
having
any
suspicion
of
it
though
jenny
who
had
been
left
here
by
her
mistress
was
sent
for
home
steventon
sunday
november
my
dear
sister
i
expected
to
have
heard
from
you
this
morning
but
no
letter
is
come
i
shall
not
take
the
trouble
of
announcing
to
you
any
more
of
mary
children
if
instead
of
thanking
me
for
the
intelligence
you
always
sit
down
and
write
to
james
i
am
sure
nobody
can
desire
your
letters
so
much
as
i
do
and
i
do
think
anybody
deserves
them
so
well
having
now
relieved
my
heart
of
a
great
deal
of
malevolence
i
will
proceed
to
tell
you
that
mary
continues
quite
well
and
my
mother
tolerably
so
i
saw
the
former
on
friday
and
though
i
had
seen
her
comparatively
hearty
the
tuesday
before
i
was
really
amazed
at
the
improvement
which
three
days
had
made
in
her
she
looked
well
her
spirits
were
perfectly
good
and
she
spoke
much
more
vigorously
than
elizabeth
did
when
we
left
godmersham
i
had
only
a
glimpse
at
the
child
who
was
asleep
but
miss
debary
told
me
that
his
eyes
were
large
dark
and
handsome
looks
much
as
she
used
to
do
is
netting
herself
a
gown
in
worsteds
and
wears
what
birch
would
call
a
a
short
and
compendious
history
of
miss
debary
we
have
got
my
father
has
bought
it
against
my
private
wishes
for
it
does
not
quite
satisfy
my
feelings
that
we
should
purchase
the
only
one
of
egerton
works
of
which
his
family
are
ashamed
that
these
scruples
however
do
not
at
all
interfere
with
my
reading
it
you
will
easily
believe
we
have
neither
of
us
yet
finished
the
first
volume
my
father
is
disappointed
am
not
for
i
expected
nothing
better
never
did
any
book
carry
more
internal
evidence
of
its
author
every
sentiment
is
completely
egerton
there
is
very
little
story
and
what
there
is
is
told
in
a
strange
unconnected
way
there
are
many
characters
introduced
apparently
merely
to
be
delineated
we
have
not
been
able
to
recognise
any
of
them
hitherto
except
and
hey
and
oxenden
who
is
not
very
tenderly
treated
we
have
got
boswell
to
the
and
are
to
have
his
of
and
as
some
money
will
yet
remain
in
burdon
hands
it
is
to
be
laid
out
in
the
purchase
of
cowper
works
this
would
please
clarke
could
he
know
it
steventon
december
my
dear
cassandra
i
am
so
good
as
to
write
you
again
thus
speedily
to
let
you
know
that
i
have
just
heard
from
frank
he
was
at
cadiz
alive
and
well
on
october
and
had
then
very
lately
received
a
letter
from
you
written
as
long
ago
as
when
the
was
at
helen
but
his
latest
intelligence
of
us
was
in
one
from
me
of
september
which
i
sent
soon
after
we
got
to
godmersham
he
had
written
a
packet
full
for
his
dearest
friends
in
england
early
in
october
to
go
by
the
but
the
was
not
sailed
nor
likely
to
sail
when
he
despatched
this
to
me
it
comprehended
letters
for
both
of
us
for
lord
spencer
daysh
and
the
east
india
directors
lord
vincent
had
left
the
fleet
when
he
wrote
and
was
gone
to
gibraltar
it
was
said
to
superintend
the
fitting
out
of
a
private
expedition
from
thence
against
some
of
the
enemies
ports
minorca
or
malta
were
conjectured
to
be
the
objects
frank
writes
in
good
spirits
but
says
that
our
correspondence
can
not
be
so
easily
carried
on
in
future
as
it
has
been
as
the
communication
between
cadiz
and
lisbon
is
less
frequent
than
formerly
you
and
my
mother
therefore
must
not
alarm
yourselves
at
the
long
intervals
that
may
divide
his
letters
i
address
this
advice
to
you
two
as
being
the
most
of
the
family
my
mother
made
her
into
the
through
crowds
of
admiring
spectators
yesterday
afternoon
and
we
all
drank
tea
together
for
the
first
time
these
five
weeks
she
has
had
a
tolerable
night
and
bids
fair
for
a
continuance
in
the
same
brilliant
course
of
action
lyford
was
here
yesterday
he
came
while
we
were
at
dinner
and
partook
of
our
elegant
entertainment
i
was
not
ashamed
at
asking
him
to
sit
down
to
table
for
we
had
some
a
sparerib
and
a
pudding
he
wants
my
mother
to
look
yellow
and
to
throw
out
a
rash
but
she
will
do
neither
we
live
entirely
in
the
now
which
i
like
very
much
i
always
feel
so
much
more
elegant
in
it
than
in
the
parlour
i
have
made
myself
two
or
three
caps
to
wear
of
evenings
since
i
came
home
and
they
save
me
a
world
of
torment
as
to
which
at
present
gives
me
no
trouble
beyond
washing
and
brushing
for
my
long
hair
is
always
plaited
up
out
of
sight
and
my
short
hair
curls
well
enough
to
want
no
papering
my
father
is
glad
to
hear
so
good
an
account
of
edward
pigs
and
desires
he
may
be
told
as
encouragement
to
his
taste
for
them
that
lord
bolton
is
particularly
curious
in
pigs
has
had
pigstyes
of
a
most
elegant
construction
built
for
them
and
visits
them
every
morning
as
soon
as
he
rises
this
and
the
following
letter
contain
allusions
to
jane
wearing
caps
those
intended
for
use
at
balls
would
be
smart
worn
at
that
period
by
younger
as
well
as
older
women
in
later
life
the
miss
austens
seem
to
have
been
rather
indifferent
to
fashion
and
beauty
in
their
clothing
although
always
very
neat
steventon
tuesday
december
i
took
the
liberty
a
few
days
ago
of
asking
your
black
velvet
bonnet
to
lend
me
its
cawl
which
it
very
readily
did
and
by
which
i
have
been
enabled
to
give
a
considerable
improvement
of
dignity
to
my
cap
which
was
before
too
to
please
me
i
shall
wear
it
on
thursday
but
i
hope
you
will
not
be
offended
with
me
for
following
your
advice
as
to
its
ornaments
only
in
part
i
still
venture
to
retain
the
narrow
silver
round
it
put
twice
round
without
any
bow
and
instead
of
the
black
military
feather
shall
put
in
the
coquelicot
one
as
being
smarter
and
besides
coquelicot
is
to
be
all
the
fashion
this
winter
after
the
ball
i
shall
probably
make
it
entirely
black
i
am
sorry
that
our
dear
charles
begins
to
feel
the
dignity
of
my
father
will
write
to
admiral
gambier
he
must
have
already
received
so
much
satisfaction
from
his
acquaintance
and
patronage
of
frank
that
he
will
be
delighted
i
dare
say
to
have
another
of
the
family
introduced
to
him
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
my
dear
little
george
for
his
message
for
his
at
least
his
i
suppose
was
only
in
consequence
of
some
hint
of
my
favourable
intentions
towards
him
from
his
father
or
mother
i
am
sincerely
rejoiced
however
that
i
ever
was
born
since
it
has
been
the
means
of
procuring
him
a
dish
of
tea
give
my
best
love
to
him
i
have
received
a
very
civil
note
from
martin
requesting
my
name
as
a
subscriber
to
her
library
which
opens
january
and
my
name
or
rather
yours
is
accordingly
given
my
mother
finds
the
money
mary
subscribes
too
which
i
am
glad
of
but
hardly
expected
as
an
inducement
to
subscribe
martin
tells
me
that
her
collection
is
not
to
consist
only
of
novels
but
of
every
kind
of
literature
she
might
have
spared
this
pretension
to
family
who
are
great
and
not
ashamed
of
being
so
but
it
was
necessary
i
suppose
to
the
of
half
her
subscribers
i
enjoyed
the
hard
black
frosts
of
last
week
very
much
and
one
day
while
they
lasted
walked
to
deane
by
myself
i
do
not
know
that
i
ever
did
such
a
thing
in
my
life
before
we
dine
now
at
three
and
have
done
dinner
i
suppose
before
you
begin
we
drink
tea
at
six
i
am
afraid
you
will
despise
us
my
father
reads
cowper
to
us
in
the
morning
to
which
i
listen
when
i
can
how
do
you
spend
your
evenings
i
guess
that
elizabeth
works
that
you
read
to
her
and
that
edward
goes
to
sleep
i
have
changed
my
mind
and
changed
the
trimmings
of
my
cap
this
morning
they
are
now
such
as
you
suggested
i
felt
as
if
i
should
not
prosper
if
i
strayed
from
your
directions
and
i
think
it
makes
me
look
more
like
lady
conyngham
now
than
it
did
before
which
is
all
that
one
lives
for
now
i
believe
i
make
my
new
gown
like
my
robe
but
the
back
of
the
latter
is
all
in
a
piece
with
the
tail
and
will
seven
yards
enable
me
to
copy
it
in
that
respect
people
get
so
horribly
poor
and
economical
in
this
part
of
the
world
that
i
have
no
patience
with
them
kent
is
the
only
place
for
happiness
everybody
is
rich
there
i
must
do
similar
justice
however
to
the
windsor
neighbourhood
steventon
monday
night
december
my
dear
cassandra
i
have
got
some
pleasant
news
for
you
which
i
am
eager
to
communicate
and
therefore
begin
my
letter
sooner
though
i
shall
not
it
sooner
than
usual
admiral
gambier
in
reply
to
my
application
writes
as
follows
it
is
usual
to
keep
young
officers
in
small
vessels
it
being
most
proper
on
account
of
their
inexperience
and
it
being
also
a
situation
where
they
are
more
in
the
way
of
learning
their
duty
your
son
has
been
continued
in
the
but
i
have
mentioned
to
the
board
of
admiralty
his
wish
to
be
in
a
frigate
and
when
a
proper
opportunity
offers
and
it
is
judged
that
he
has
taken
his
turn
in
a
small
ship
i
hope
he
will
be
removed
with
regard
to
your
son
now
in
the
i
am
glad
i
can
give
you
the
assurance
that
his
promotion
is
likely
to
take
place
very
soon
as
lord
spencer
has
been
so
good
as
to
say
he
would
include
him
in
an
arrangement
that
he
proposes
making
in
a
short
time
relative
to
some
promotions
in
that
quarter
there
i
may
now
finish
my
letter
and
go
and
hang
myself
for
i
am
sure
i
can
neither
write
nor
do
anything
which
will
not
appear
insipid
to
you
after
this
i
really
think
he
will
soon
be
made
and
only
wish
we
could
communicate
our
foreknowledge
of
the
event
to
him
whom
it
principally
concerns
my
father
has
written
to
daysh
to
desire
that
he
will
inform
us
if
he
can
when
the
commission
is
sent
your
chief
wish
is
now
ready
to
be
accomplished
and
could
lord
spencer
give
happiness
to
martha
at
the
same
time
what
a
joyful
heart
he
would
make
of
yours
i
have
sent
the
same
extract
of
the
sweets
of
gambier
to
charles
who
poor
fellow
though
he
sinks
into
nothing
but
an
humble
attendant
on
the
hero
of
the
piece
will
i
hope
be
contented
with
the
prospect
held
out
to
him
by
what
the
admiral
says
it
appears
as
if
he
had
been
designedly
kept
in
the
but
i
will
not
torment
myself
with
conjectures
and
suppositions
facts
shall
satisfy
me
frank
had
not
heard
from
any
of
us
for
ten
weeks
when
he
wrote
me
on
november
in
consequence
of
lord
vincent
being
removed
to
gibraltar
when
his
commission
is
sent
however
it
will
not
be
so
long
on
its
road
as
our
letters
because
all
the
government
despatches
are
forwarded
by
land
to
his
lordship
from
lisbon
with
great
regularity
i
spent
my
time
at
manydown
very
quietly
and
very
pleasantly
with
catherine
miss
blachford
is
agreeable
enough
i
do
not
want
people
to
be
very
agreeable
as
it
saves
me
the
trouble
of
liking
them
a
great
deal
our
ball
was
very
thin
but
by
no
means
unpleasant
there
were
people
and
only
eleven
ladies
out
of
the
number
and
but
five
single
women
in
the
room
of
the
gentlemen
present
you
may
have
some
idea
from
the
list
of
my
partners
wood
lefroy
rice
a
butcher
belonging
to
the
temples
a
sailor
and
not
of
the
light
dragoons
temple
not
the
horrid
one
of
all
wm
orde
cousin
to
the
kingsclere
man
john
harwood
and
calland
who
appeared
as
usual
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
stood
every
now
and
then
behind
catherine
and
me
to
be
talked
to
and
abused
for
not
dancing
we
teased
him
however
into
it
at
last
i
was
very
glad
to
see
him
again
after
so
long
a
separation
and
he
was
altogether
rather
the
genius
and
flirt
of
the
evening
he
enquired
after
you
there
were
twenty
dances
and
i
danced
them
all
and
without
any
fatigue
i
was
glad
to
find
myself
capable
of
dancing
so
much
and
with
so
much
satisfaction
as
i
did
from
my
slender
enjoyment
of
the
ashford
balls
as
assemblies
for
dancing
i
had
not
thought
myself
equal
to
it
but
in
cold
weather
and
with
few
couples
i
fancy
i
could
just
as
well
dance
for
a
week
together
as
for
half
an
hour
my
black
cap
was
openly
admired
by
lefroy
and
secretly
i
imagine
by
everybody
else
in
the
room
i
thank
you
for
your
long
letter
which
i
will
endeavour
to
deserve
by
writing
the
rest
of
this
as
closely
as
possible
i
am
full
of
joy
at
much
of
your
information
that
you
should
have
been
to
a
ball
and
have
danced
at
it
and
supped
with
the
prince
and
that
you
should
meditate
the
purchase
of
a
new
muslin
gown
are
delightful
circumstances
poor
edward
it
is
very
hard
that
he
who
has
everything
else
in
the
world
that
he
can
wish
for
should
not
have
good
health
too
i
know
no
one
more
deserving
of
happiness
without
alloy
than
edward
is
of
my
charities
to
the
poor
since
i
came
home
you
shall
have
a
faithful
account
i
have
given
a
pair
of
worsted
stockings
to
mary
hutchins
dame
kew
mary
steevens
and
dame
staples
a
shift
to
hannah
staples
and
a
shawl
to
betty
dawkins
amounting
in
all
to
about
half
a
guinea
but
i
have
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
would
accept
of
anything
because
i
have
not
made
them
the
offer
the
lords
of
the
admiralty
will
have
enough
of
our
applications
at
present
for
i
hear
from
charles
that
he
has
written
to
lord
spencer
himself
to
be
removed
i
am
afraid
his
serene
highness
will
be
in
a
passion
and
order
some
of
our
heads
to
be
cut
off
steventon
friday
december
my
dear
cassandra
frank
is
made
he
was
yesterday
raised
to
the
rank
of
commander
and
appointed
to
the
sloop
now
at
gibraltar
a
letter
from
daysh
has
just
announced
this
and
as
it
is
confirmed
by
a
very
friendly
one
from
mathew
to
the
same
effect
transcribing
one
from
admiral
gambier
to
the
general
we
have
no
reason
to
suspect
the
truth
of
it
as
soon
as
you
have
cried
a
little
for
joy
you
may
go
on
and
learn
farther
that
the
india
house
have
taken
petition
into
consideration
this
comes
from
daysh
and
likewise
that
lieutenant
charles
john
austen
is
removed
to
the
frigate
this
comes
from
the
admiral
we
can
not
find
out
where
the
is
but
i
hope
we
shall
now
see
charles
here
at
all
events
this
letter
is
to
be
dedicated
entirely
to
good
news
if
you
will
send
my
father
an
account
of
your
washing
and
letter
expenses
he
will
send
you
a
draft
for
the
amount
of
it
as
well
as
for
your
next
quarter
and
for
edward
rent
if
you
do
buy
a
muslin
gown
now
on
the
strength
of
this
money
and
frank
promotion
i
shall
never
forgive
you
lefroy
has
just
sent
me
word
that
lady
dorchester
meant
to
invite
me
to
her
ball
on
january
which
though
an
humble
blessing
compared
with
what
the
last
page
records
i
do
not
consider
as
any
calamity
i
can
not
write
any
more
now
but
i
have
written
enough
to
make
you
very
happy
and
therefore
may
safely
conclude
steventon
tuesday
january
i
am
tolerably
glad
to
hear
that
edward
income
is
a
good
one
as
glad
as
i
can
be
at
being
rich
except
you
and
me
and
i
am
thoroughly
rejoiced
to
hear
of
his
present
to
you
i
assure
you
that
i
dread
the
idea
of
going
to
brighton
as
much
as
you
do
but
i
am
not
without
hopes
that
something
may
happen
to
prevent
it
you
express
so
little
anxiety
about
my
being
murdered
under
ashe
park
copse
by
hulbert
servant
that
i
have
a
great
mind
not
to
tell
you
whether
i
was
or
not
and
shall
only
say
that
i
did
not
return
home
that
night
or
the
next
as
martha
kindly
made
room
for
me
in
her
bed
which
was
the
one
in
the
new
nursery
nurse
and
the
child
slept
upon
the
floor
and
there
we
all
were
in
some
confusion
and
great
comfort
the
bed
did
exceedingly
well
for
us
both
to
lie
awake
in
and
talk
till
two
and
to
sleep
in
the
rest
of
the
night
i
love
martha
better
than
ever
and
i
mean
to
go
and
see
her
if
i
can
when
she
gets
home
we
all
dined
at
the
harwoods
on
thursday
and
the
party
broke
up
the
next
morning
my
sweet
little
george
i
am
delighted
to
hear
that
he
has
such
an
inventive
genius
as
to
i
admired
his
yellow
wafer
very
much
and
hope
he
will
choose
the
wafer
for
your
next
letter
i
wore
my
green
shoes
last
night
and
took
my
with
me
i
am
very
glad
he
never
threw
it
into
the
river
knight
giving
up
the
godmersham
estate
to
edward
was
no
such
prodigious
act
of
generosity
after
all
it
seems
for
she
has
reserved
herself
an
income
out
of
it
still
this
ought
to
be
known
that
her
conduct
may
not
be
overrated
i
rather
think
edward
shows
the
most
magnanimity
of
the
two
in
accepting
her
resignation
with
such
incumbrances
the
more
i
write
the
better
my
eye
gets
so
i
shall
at
least
keep
on
till
it
is
quite
well
before
i
give
up
my
pen
to
my
mother
i
do
not
think
i
was
very
much
in
request
at
the
kempshot
ball
people
were
rather
apt
not
to
ask
me
till
they
could
not
help
it
one
consequence
you
know
varies
so
much
at
times
without
any
particular
reason
there
was
one
gentleman
an
officer
of
the
cheshire
a
very
young
man
who
i
was
told
wanted
very
much
to
be
introduced
to
me
but
as
he
did
not
want
it
quite
enough
to
take
much
trouble
in
effecting
it
we
never
could
bring
it
about
i
danced
with
john
wood
again
twice
with
a
south
a
lad
from
winchester
who
i
suppose
is
as
far
from
being
related
to
the
bishop
of
that
diocese
as
it
is
possible
to
be
with
lefroy
and
harwood
who
i
think
takes
to
me
rather
more
than
he
used
to
do
one
of
my
gayest
actions
was
sitting
down
two
dances
in
preference
to
having
lord
bolton
eldest
son
for
my
partner
who
danced
too
ill
to
be
endured
the
miss
charterises
were
there
and
played
the
parts
of
the
miss
edens
with
great
spirit
charles
never
came
naughty
charles
i
suppose
he
could
not
get
superseded
in
time
i
do
not
wonder
at
your
wanting
to
read
again
so
seldom
as
you
have
gone
through
it
and
that
so
long
ago
i
be
able
to
send
this
to
the
post
which
exalts
me
to
the
utmost
pinnacle
of
human
felicity
and
makes
me
bask
in
the
sunshine
of
prosperity
or
gives
me
any
other
sensation
of
pleasure
in
studied
language
which
you
may
prefer
do
not
be
angry
with
me
for
not
filling
my
sheet
and
believe
me
yours
affectionately
j
steventon
monday
january
charles
leaves
us
the
is
in
the
downs
and
daysh
advises
him
to
join
her
there
directly
as
there
is
no
chance
of
her
going
to
the
westward
charles
does
not
approve
of
this
at
all
and
will
not
be
much
grieved
if
he
should
be
too
late
for
her
before
she
sails
as
he
may
then
hope
to
get
into
a
better
station
he
attempted
to
go
to
town
last
night
and
got
as
far
on
his
road
thither
as
deane
gate
but
both
the
coaches
were
full
and
we
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
back
again
martha
writes
me
word
that
charles
was
very
much
admired
at
kintbury
and
lefroy
never
saw
anyone
so
much
improved
in
her
life
and
thinks
him
handsomer
than
henry
he
appears
to
far
more
advantage
here
than
he
did
at
godmersham
not
surrounded
by
strangers
and
neither
oppressed
by
a
pain
in
his
face
or
powder
in
his
hair
yesterday
came
a
letter
to
my
mother
from
edward
cooper
to
announce
not
the
birth
of
a
child
but
of
a
living
for
leigh
has
begged
his
acceptance
of
the
rectory
of
in
staffordshire
vacant
by
johnson
death
we
collect
from
his
letter
that
he
means
to
reside
there
in
which
he
shows
his
wisdom
staffordshire
is
a
good
way
off
so
we
shall
see
nothing
more
of
them
till
some
fifteen
years
hence
the
miss
coopers
are
presented
to
us
fine
jolly
handsome
ignorant
girls
the
living
is
valued
at
a
year
but
perhaps
it
may
be
improvable
how
will
they
be
able
to
convey
the
furniture
of
the
so
far
in
safety
our
first
cousins
seem
all
dropping
off
very
fast
one
is
incorporated
into
the
family
another
dies
and
a
third
goes
into
staffordshire
our
own
particular
brother
got
a
place
in
the
coach
last
night
and
is
now
i
suppose
in
town
i
have
no
objection
at
all
to
your
buying
our
gowns
there
as
your
imagination
has
pictured
to
you
exactly
such
a
one
as
is
necessary
to
make
me
happy
you
quite
abash
me
by
your
progress
in
notting
for
i
am
still
without
silk
you
must
get
me
some
in
town
or
in
canterbury
it
should
be
finer
than
yours
i
thought
edward
would
not
approve
of
charles
being
a
crop
and
rather
wished
you
to
conceal
it
from
him
at
present
lest
it
might
fall
on
his
spirits
and
retard
his
recovery
i
have
just
heard
from
charles
who
is
by
this
time
at
deal
he
is
to
be
second
lieutenant
which
pleases
him
very
well
the
is
come
into
the
downs
which
pleases
him
likewise
he
expects
to
be
ordered
to
sheerness
shortly
as
the
has
never
been
refitted
my
father
and
mother
made
the
same
match
for
you
last
night
and
are
very
much
pleased
with
it
is
a
beauty
of
my
mother
footnotes
harry
was
one
of
the
digweeds
edward
austen
tenants
at
steventon
who
shared
with
the
rectory
party
the
right
of
shooting
over
the
manor
ch
the
english
says
deputation
was
necessary
to
constitute
a
gamekeeper
but
it
was
also
frequently
used
as
a
means
of
giving
to
friends
the
privilege

the
leigh
perrots
and
bath
austen
brother
james
leigh
perrot
and
his
wife
had
for
many
years
led
a
prosperous
and
uneventful
life
at
scarlets
enjoying
the
respect
and
friendship
of
a
large
circle
of
acquaintances
scarlets
was
a
small
property
on
the
bath
road
about
thirty
miles
from
london
adjoining
the
hamlet
of
hare
hatch
where
as
was
often
the
case
on
a
great
highroad
a
number
of
gentlemen
places
of
moderate
size
were
congregated
within
easy
reach
of
each
other
among
those
who
sooner
or
later
were
neighbours
of
the
leigh
perrots
were
maria
edgeworth
father
richard
lovell
edgeworth
who
speaks
of
the
help
he
received
from
perrot
in
his
experiments
of
telegraphing
from
hare
hatch
to
nettlebed
by
means
of
windmills
and
thomas
day
the
author
of
and
the
house
at
scarlets
in
its
then
existing
shape
was
the
work
of
leigh
perrot
and
was
of
a
suitable
size
for
a
childless
couple
in
easy
circumstances
its
owner
had
abilities
which
might
have
stood
him
in
good
stead
in
any
profession
had
he
adopted
one
and
he
was
of
a
kind
and
affectionate
disposition
combining
an
easy
temper
with
ready
wit
and
much
resolution
of
character
his
wife
was
hardly
formed
for
popularity
but
she
was
highly
respected
she
was
not
exactly
but
she
had
a
great
idea
of
the
claims
of
family
ties
and
a
keen
sense
of
justice
as
between
herself
and
others
the
couple
were
unusually
devoted
to
each
other
the
only
crook
in
their
lot
appeared
to
be
the
constant
gout
attacks
from
which
the
husband
suffered
and
the
necessity
for
frequent
visits
to
bath
visits
by
the
way
which
had
helped
to
give
to
their
niece
jane
austen
such
good
opportunities
for
studying
the
bath
varieties
of
human
nature
the
journey
however
of
the
austens
to
bath
in
the
spring
of
described
in
our
next
letters
was
independent
of
the
leigh
perrots
edward
austen
had
been
suffering
like
his
uncle
from
gout
and
determined
to
try
the
waters
of
bath
his
mother
and
jane
accompanying
his
family
party
thither
but
the
perrots
were
already
settled
in
paragon
buildings
when
the
austens
arrived
and
the
two
families
would
be
constantly
meeting
the
austens
took
up
their
quarters
in
queen
square
which
jane
seems
to
have
liked
much
better
than
she
made
her
miss
musgroves
like
it
when
she
wrote
sixteen
years
later

square
friday
may
my
dearest
cassandra
our
journey
yesterday
went
off
exceedingly
well
nothing
occurred
to
alarm
or
delay
us
we
found
the
roads
in
excellent
order
had
very
good
horses
all
the
way
and
reached
devizes
with
ease
by
four
i
suppose
john
has
told
you
in
what
manner
we
were
divided
when
we
left
andover
and
no
alteration
was
afterwards
made
at
devizes
we
had
comfortable
rooms
and
a
good
dinner
to
which
we
sat
down
about
five
amongst
other
things
we
had
asparagus
and
a
lobster
which
made
me
wish
for
you
and
some
cheesecakes
on
which
the
children
made
so
delightful
a
supper
as
to
endear
the
town
of
devizes
to
them
for
a
long
time
well
here
we
are
at
bath
we
got
here
about
one
and
have
been
arrived
just
long
enough
to
go
over
the
house
fix
on
our
rooms
and
be
very
well
pleased
with
the
whole
of
it
poor
elizabeth
has
had
a
dismal
ride
of
it
from
devizes
for
it
has
rained
almost
all
the
way
and
our
first
view
of
bath
has
been
just
as
gloomy
as
it
was
last
november
twelvemonth
i
have
got
so
many
things
to
say
so
many
things
equally
important
that
i
know
not
on
which
to
decide
at
present
and
shall
therefore
go
and
eat
with
the
children
we
stopped
in
paragon
as
we
came
along
but
as
it
was
too
wet
and
dirty
for
us
to
get
out
we
could
only
see
frank
who
told
us
that
his
master
was
very
indifferent
but
had
had
a
better
night
last
night
than
usual
we
are
exceedingly
pleased
with
the
house
the
rooms
are
quite
as
large
as
we
expected
bromley
is
a
fat
woman
in
mourning
and
a
little
black
kitten
runs
about
the
staircase
elizabeth
has
the
apartment
within
the
she
wanted
my
mother
to
have
it
but
as
there
was
no
bed
in
the
inner
one
and
the
stairs
are
so
much
easier
of
ascent
or
my
mother
so
much
stronger
than
in
paragon
as
not
to
regard
the
double
flight
it
is
settled
for
us
to
be
above
where
we
have
two
very
rooms
with
dirty
quilts
and
everything
comfortable
i
have
the
outward
and
larger
apartment
as
i
ought
to
have
which
is
quite
as
large
as
our
at
home
and
my
mother
is
not
materially
less
the
beds
are
both
as
large
as
any
at
steventon
and
i
have
a
very
nice
chest
of
drawers
and
a
closet
full
of
shelves
so
full
indeed
that
there
is
nothing
else
in
it
and
it
should
therefore
be
called
a
cupboard
rather
than
a
closet
i
suppose
there
was
a
very
long
list
of
arrivals
here
in
the
newspaper
yesterday
so
that
we
need
not
immediately
dread
absolute
solitude
and
there
is
a
public
breakfast
in
sydney
gardens
every
morning
so
that
we
shall
not
be
wholly
starved
yours
very
affectionately
jane
queen
square
sunday
june
flowers
are
very
much
worn
and
fruit
is
still
more
the
thing
elizabeth
has
a
bunch
of
strawberries
and
i
have
seen
grapes
cherries
plums
and
apricots
there
are
likewise
almonds
and
raisins
french
plums
and
tamarinds
at
the
grocers
but
i
have
never
seen
any
of
them
in
hats
a
plum
or
greengage
would
cost
three
shillings
cherries
and
grapes
about
five
i
believe
but
this
is
at
some
of
the
dearest
shops
my
aunt
has
told
me
of
a
very
cheap
one
near
walcot
church
to
which
i
shall
go
in
quest
of
something
for
you
i
have
never
seen
an
old
woman
at
the
i
spent
friday
evening
with
the
mapletons
and
was
obliged
to
submit
to
being
pleased
in
spite
of
my
inclination
we
took
a
very
charming
walk
from
six
to
eight
up
beacon
hill
and
across
some
fields
to
the
village
of
charlecombe
which
is
sweetly
situated
in
a
little
green
valley
as
a
village
with
such
a
name
ought
to
be
marianne
is
sensible
and
intelligent
and
even
jane
considering
how
fair
she
is
is
not
unpleasant
we
had
a
miss
north
and
a
gould
of
our
party
the
latter
walked
home
with
me
after
tea
he
is
a
very
young
man
just
entered
oxford
wears
spectacles
and
has
heard
that
was
written
by
johnson
there
is
to
be
a
grand
gala
on
tuesday
evening
in
sydney
gardens
a
concert
with
illuminations
and
fireworks
to
the
latter
elizabeth
and
i
look
forward
with
pleasure
and
even
the
concert
will
have
more
than
its
usual
charm
for
me
as
the
gardens
are
large
enough
for
me
to
get
pretty
well
beyond
the
reach
of
its
sound
in
the
morning
lady
willoughby
is
to
present
the
colours
to
some
corps
or
yeomanry
or
other
in
the
crescent
queen
square
tuesday
june
i
would
not
let
martha
read
again
upon
any
account
and
am
very
glad
that
i
did
not
leave
it
in
your
power
she
is
very
cunning
but
i
saw
through
her
design
she
means
to
publish
it
from
memory
and
one
more
perusal
must
enable
her
to
do
it
as
for
when
i
get
home
she
shall
have
it
as
soon
as
ever
she
will
own
that
elliott
is
handsomer
than
lance
that
fair
men
are
preferable
to
black
for
i
mean
to
take
every
opportunity
of
rooting
out
her
prejudices
i
am
very
glad
you
liked
my
lace
and
so
are
you
and
so
is
martha
and
we
are
all
glad
together
i
have
got
your
cloak
home
which
is
quite
delightful
as
delightful
at
least
as
half
the
circumstances
which
are
called
so
i
do
not
know
what
is
the
matter
with
me
but
i
can
not
write
quietly
i
am
always
wandering
away
into
some
exclamation
or
other
fortunately
i
have
nothing
very
particular
to
say
fanny
desires
her
love
to
you
her
love
to
grandpapa
her
love
to
anna
and
her
love
to
hannah
the
latter
is
particularly
to
be
remembered
edward
desires
his
love
to
you
to
grandpapa
to
anna
to
little
edward
to
aunt
james
and
uncle
james
and
he
hopes
all
your
turkeys
and
ducks
and
chicken
and
guinea
fowls
are
very
well
and
he
wishes
you
very
much
to
send
him
a
printed
letter
and
so
does
fanny
and
they
both
rather
think
they
shall
answer
it
queen
square
wednesday
june
last
sunday
we
all
drank
tea
in
paragon
my
uncle
is
still
in
his
flannels
but
is
getting
better
again
last
night
we
were
in
sydney
gardens
again
as
there
was
a
repetition
of
the
gala
which
went
off
so
ill
on
the
we
did
not
go
till
nine
and
then
were
in
very
good
time
for
the
fireworks
which
were
really
beautiful
and
surpassing
my
expectation
the
illuminations
too
were
very
pretty
the
weather
was
as
favourable
as
it
was
otherwise
a
fortnight
ago
the
play
on
saturday
is
to
conclude
our
gaieties
here
for
nothing
but
a
lengthened
stay
will
make
it
otherwise
we
go
with
fellowes
the
austens
quitted
bath
on
wednesday
june
reaching
steventon
on
the
following
day
and
leaving
the
leigh
perrots
to
an
unexpected
fate
which
they
had
done
nothing
whatever
to
deserve
on
thursday
august
leigh
perrot
went
into
a
milliner
shop
at
the
corner
of
bath
and
stall
streets
kept
by
a
certain
gregory
but
known
as
smith
and
bought
a
piece
of
lace
she
paid
for
it
and
took
it
away
wrapped
up
in
a
piece
of
paper
after
leaving
the
shop
perrot
met
her
husband
and
strolled
about
with
him
as
they
the
same
shop
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
gregory
rushed
out
and
accused
perrot
of
having
in
her
possession
a
piece
of
lace
perrot
replied
that
if
so
it
must
have
been
put
up
in
her
parcel
by
mistake
she
then
handed
her
parcel
to
gregory
to
examine
when
a
piece
of
lace
was
found
therein
as
well
as
a
piece
of
gregory
at
once
accused
perrot
of
having
stolen
it
and
refusing
to
listen
to
any
protest
made
off
with
the
incriminating
piece
of
lace
a
little
later
as
the
perrots
were
turning
the
corner
of
the
abbey
churchyard
charles
filby
the
shop
assistant
who
had
actually
sold
the
black
lace
came
up
and
asked
perrot
his
name
perrot
replied
that
he
lived
at
no
paragon
buildings
and
that
his
name
was
on
the
door
on
the
same
day
gregory
and
filby
went
to
the
town
hall
to
lay
information
before
the
magistrates
but
found
them
so
busily
engaged
in
dealing
with
the
excesses
of
the
soldiers
who
were
at
that
time
passing
through
bath
that
the
information
could
not
be
taken
before
august
meanwhile
the
piece
of
lace
was
lodged
at
any
rate
for
the
night
of
august
at
the
house
of
a
certain
printer
named
gye
the
result
of
the
magistrates
inquiry
may
be
discovered
in
of
august
where
we
read
the
lady
of
a
gentleman
of
bath
possessed
of
a
good
fortune
and
respected
by
a
numerous
circle
of
acquaintance
was
committed
on
thursday
by
chapman
the
mayor
to
the
county
gaol
at
ilchester
on
a
charge
of
privately
stealing
a
card
of
lace
from
a
haberdasher
shop
as
perrot
did
not
come
up
for
trial
until
the
end
of
the
following
march
she
had
to
undergo
a
long
and
trying
confinement
it
appears
that
she
was
not
lodged
actually
in
the
gaol
but
in
some
neighbouring
house
kept
by
a
man
of
the
name
of
scadding
the
charge
was
a
monstrous
one
the
accused
had
ample
means
to
indulge
every
wish
and
nothing
short
of
lunacy
of
which
she
never
showed
the
slightest
sign
could
have
induced
her
to
commit
so
petty
a
theft
her
high
character
and
the
absence
of
motive
combined
to
render
it
incredible
and
had
she
been
capable
of
such
a
deed
she
would
not
have
courted
detection
by
walking
quietly
past
the
shop
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
with
the
parcel
in
her
hand
there
were
also
strong
reasons
for
thinking
that
the
accusation
was
the
result
of
a
plot
gye
the
printer
who
lived
in
the
was
believed
to
be
the
chief
instigator
his
character
was
indifferent
and
he
had
money
invested
in
gregory
shop
and
the
business
was
in
so
bad
a
way
that
there
was
a
temptation
to
seek
for
some
large
haul
by
way
of
blackmail
leigh
perrot
was
selected
as
the
victim
people
thought
because
her
husband
was
so
extremely
devoted
to
her
that
he
would
be
sure
to
do
anything
to
save
her
from
the
least
vexation
if
so
the
conspirators
were
mistaken
in
their
man
perrot
resolved
to
see
the
matter
through
and
taking
no
notice
of
the
many
suggestions
as
to
that
were
apparently
circulated
engaged
the
best
counsel
possible
secured
his
most
influential
acquaintance
as
witnesses
to
his
wife
character
and
spent
the
terrible
intervening
period
in
confinement
with
her
at
ilchester
he
was
well
aware
that
the
criminal
law
of
england
as
it
then
existed
made
the
lot
of
untried
prisoners
as
hard
and
the
difficulty
of
proving
their
innocence
as
great
as
possible
he
knew
also
that
in
the
seething
disquiet
of
men
minds
brought
about
by
the
french
revolution
it
was
quite
possible
they
might
encounter
a
jury
anxious
to
cast
discredit
on
the
classes
he
was
therefore
prepared
for
a
failure
of
justice
and
we
are
told
had
arranged
that
in
case
of
an
adverse
verdict
followed
by
transportation
he
would
sell
his
property
and
accompany
his
wife
across
the
seas
among
the
warmest
supporters
of
the
leigh
perrots
was
morris
a
lawyer
of
eminence
well
used
to
dealing
with
evidence
but
now
living
as
an
invalid
at
bath
he
was
a
total
stranger
to
the
accused
but
maintained
most
energetically
that
apart
from
her
character
the
nature
of
the
evidence
adduced
against
her
would
have
been
sufficient
to
prove
her
innocence
the
amazement
and
indignation
of
the
steventon
party
may
be
imagined
they
were
too
sensible
to
believe
that
so
mean
and
objectless
a
crime
should
really
have
been
committed
by
a
respectable
woman
a
near
relation
of
their
own
whom
they
knew
intimately
but
it
was
not
easy
to

austen
seem
at
last
to
have
come
no
doubt
with
their
daughters
to
the
momentous
decision
mentioned
in
the
following
letter
which
was
addressed
to
leigh
perrot
on
january
by
her
cousin
montague
cholmeley
you
tell
me
that
your
good
sister
austen
has
offered
you
one
or
both
of
her
daughters
to
continue
with
you
during
your
stay
in
that
vile
place
but
you
decline
the
kind
offer
as
you
can
not
procure
them
accommodation
in
the
house
with
you
and
you
can
not
let
those
elegant
young
women
be
your
inmates
in
a
prison
nor
be
subjected
to
the
inconveniences
which
you
are
obliged
to
put
up
with
so
cassandra

jane
just
escaped
a
residence
in
gaol

another

a
long
time
as
i
was
bad
and
when
i
was
too
bad

so

the
trial
took
place
at
taunton
on
saturday
march
the
old
castle
hall
where
judge
jeffreys
once
sat
on
his
assizes
said
to
be
capable
of
containing
persons
was
filled
at
an
early
hour
so
urgent
was
the
curiosity
even
of
the
bar
that
the
prius
court
which
stood
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
hall
was
not
opened
for
business
that
morning
all
the
counsel
on
the
circuit
surrounding
the
table
of
the
crown
bar
while
the
rest
of
the
hall
was
thronged
with
anxious
spectators
many
hundreds
of
whom
could
not
possibly
have
heard
a
word
that
was
said
and
were
almost
crushed
to
death
and
suffocated
with
heat
between
seven
and
eight
leigh
perrot
who
had
been
conveyed
from
ilchester
appeared
in
the
dock
attended
by
leigh
perrot
and
three
ladies
and
the
proceedings
commenced
after
the
evidence
for
the
prosecution
was
closed
the
prisoner
was
invited
by
the
judge
to
make
her
defence
she
attempted
to
address
the
court
but
after
speaking
a
few
sentences
became
so
much
agitated
that
her
voice
failed
her
whereupon
jekyll
one
of
her
counsel
was
requested
to
repeat
to
the
court
what
she
wished
to
address
to
them
she
then
dictated
as
follows
my
lord
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury
i
am
informed
by
my
counsel
that
they
can
not
be
permitted
to
offer
any
observations
to
you
on
my
case
the
circumstances
of
it
do
not
render
it
necessary
to
detain
you
long
i
shall
therefore
take
this
opportunity
of
troubling
you
with
a
few
words
placed
in
a
situation
the
most
eligible
that
any
woman
could
desire
with
supplies
so
ample
that
i
was
left
rich
after
every
wish
was
gratified
blessed
in
the
affections
of
the
most
generous
man
as
a
husband
what
could
induce
me
to
commit
such
a
crime
depraved
indeed
must
that
mind
be
that
under
such
circumstances
could
be
so
culpable
you
will
hear
from
my
noble
and
truly
respectable
friends
what
has
been
my
conduct
and
character
for
a
long
series
of
years
you
will
hear
what
has
been
and
what
is
now
their
opinion
of
me
can
you
suppose
that
disposition
so
totally
altered
as
to
lose
all
recollection
of
the
situation
i
held
in
society
to
hazard
for
this
meanness
my
character
and
reputation
or
to
endanger
the
health
and
peace
of
mind
of
a
husband
whom
i
would
die
for
here
her
voice
faltered
she
seemed
to
be
on
the
point
of
fainting
and
leigh
perrot
who
had
sustained
all
this
trying
scene
with
wonderful
resolution
put
his
handkerchief
to
his
face
and
wept
in
agony
many
persons
in
court
even
amongst
the
counsel
participating
in
his
emotion
the
prisoner
continued
you
have
heard
their
evidence
against
me
i
shall
make
no
comment
upon
it
i
shall
leave
that
task
where
i
am
certain
it
will
be
executed
with
justice
and
mercy
i
know
my
own
oath
in
this
case
is
inadmissible
but
i
call
upon
that
god
whom
we
all
adore
to
attest
that
i
am
innocent
of
this
charge
and
may
he
reward
or
punish
me
as
i
speak
true
or
false
in
denying
it
i
call
that
god
to
witness
that
i
did
not
know
that
i
had
the
lace
in
my
possession
nor
did
i
know
it
when
gregory
accosted
me
in
the
street
i
have
nothing
more
to
add
then
followed
the
evidence
for
the
prisoner
which
was
chiefly
evidence
to
character
and
came
from
persons
occupying
prominent
positions
who
knew
her
well
either
at
her
berkshire
home
or
at
bath
the
judge
summing
up
occupied
nearly
an
hour
in
it
he
said
that
it
was
impossible
that
any
person
should
have
a
higher
character
than
the
prisoner
but
if
the
jury
were
satisfied
with
the
evidence
for
the
prosecution
and
believed
it
that
character
ought
not
to
avail
her
if
however
upon
taking
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
into
consideration
the
jury
should
see
any
reason
to
disbelieve
the
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
or
which
led
them
to
doubt
of
the
prisoner
guilt
they
should
recollect
the
very
excellent
character
which
had
been
given
her
and
in
that
case
it
ought
to
bear
great
weight
with
them
towards
an
acquittal
he
also
alluded
to
the
conduct
of
the
accused
after
leaving
the
shop
as
not
being
that
of
a
guilty
person
and
commented
on
the
ease
with
which
she
could
have
secreted
the
parcel
before
it
was
discovered
the
jury
evidently
saw
great
reason
to
disbelieve
the
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
and
after
only
fifteen
minutes
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
the
tells
us
that
trial
lasted
seven
hours
and
the
scene
of
the
acquittal
was
extremely
affecting
the
agitation
and
embraces
of
and
perrot
may
be
more
easily
conceived
than
described
the
court
was
crowded
with
elegantly
dressed
women
throughout
the
long
months
over
which
the
affair
extended
the
leigh
perrots
had
acted
as
persons
convinced
of
the
baselessness
of
the
charge
and
determined
to
confront
the
accusers
and
as
far
as
the
existing
state
of
the
law
allowed
to
establish
the
innocence
of
the
accused
among
the
quantity
of
congratulatory
letters
received
by
leigh
perrot
we
must
content
ourselves
with
quoting
the
following
from
edgeworth
edgeworthstown
ireland
april
my
dear
sir
i
do
not
think
that
i
ever
felt
so
much
astonishment
or
indignation
as
at
the
abominable
transaction
which
was
related
in
the
of
march
among
my
numerous
friends
and
acquaintance
if
there
was
a
couple
whom
i
could
have
selected
as
the
farthest
removed
from
being
the
objects
of
such
a
villainous
attack
it
would
have
been
yourselves
but
i
too
well
know
that
neither
perfect
innocence
nor
consummate
prudence
are
sufficient
shields
against
conspiracy
and
folly
and
that
bankrupt
fortune
and
bankrupt
character
prepare
men
for
the
most
desperate
attempts
i
trouble
you
my
dear
sir
with
a
few
lines
to
express
the
deep
sense
that
i
have
of
regard
and
esteem
for
you
and
the
amiable
partner
of
your
happiness
for
so
many
as
years
we
have
been
acquainted
and
during
that
time
i
do
not
think
that
i
have
met
any
man
of
such
singularly
nice
feelings
of
honour
and
justice
i
am
sensible
that
there
is
some
impropriety
in
this
address
but
you
must
excuse
it
as
i
snatched
this
piece
of
paper
the
moment
i
had
read
the
paragraph
i
allude
to
and
with
tears
of
indignation
in
my
eyes
aye
sir
with
actual
not
sentimental
tears
in
my
eyes
i
sat
down
to
write
to
you
perhaps
after
all
you
are
not
the
objects
of
this
transaction
even
if
that
should
be
the
fact
you
will
pardon
me
for
renewing
my
claim
to
your
remembrance
and
for
assuring
you
that
you
possess
my
esteem
and
affection
yours

this
strange
and
painful
episode
in
the
life
of
the
family
was
thus
brought
to
a
satisfactory
ending
an
accusation
of
petty
and
purposeless
theft
had
been
made
against
a
woman
whose
uprightness
was
known
to
all
those
around
her
a
wife
who
enjoyed
then
and
always
the
absolute
confidence
of
an
upright
husband
it
had
been
found
baseless
by
a
jury
after
only
a
few
minutes
deliberation
and
the
leigh
perrots
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
high
estimation
in
which
they
were
held
by
their
neighbours
exhibited
in
a
strong
light
this
estimation
was
to
be
theirs
for
the
remainder
of
their
lives
extending
in
his
case
over
seventeen
and
in
hers
over
years
for
our
particular
purpose
the
story
seems
worth
narrating
because
it
shows
that
the
peaceful
and
progress
of
jane
austen
life
was
not
beyond
the
reach
of
tragic
possibilities
indeed
at
or
near
this
time
there
were
three
particular
occurrences
which
when
taken
together
might
well
disturb
the
serenity
and
cheerfulness
of
her
mind
and
indispose
her
for
writing
especially
writing
of
a
humorous
character
one
of
these
events
which
has
already
been
recorded
was
her
love
story
in
the
west
another
was
leigh
perrot
trouble
and
the
third
the
loss
of
her
old
home

if
this

well
authenticated
it
would
be
incredible
but
we
must
remember
that
this
all
happened
before
the
reforms
of
sir
samuel
romilly
when
the
law
was
in
a
chaotic
state
and
when
offences
against
property
were
very
severely
dealt

any
larceny

value

a
felony
punishable
nominally
by
death
and
actually
by

years

the
transportation
may
frequently
have
been
commuted
to
a
sentence
of
imprisonment
magistrates
had
no
power
of

person
committed
for

remains
to

how

the

were
at

exchanged

had
any

may
be

sure
they
would
be

we
find
that
they
have
returned
to

its
little
incidents

its

edward

evening
october
my
dear
cassandra
you
have
had
a
very
pleasant
journey
of
course
and
have
found
elizabeth
and
all
the
children
very
well
on
your
arrival
at
godmersham
and
i
congratulate
you
on
it
edward
is
rejoicing
this
evening
i
dare
say
to
find
himself
once
more
at
home
from
which
he
fancies
he
has
been
absent
a
great
while
his
son
left
behind
him
the
very
fine
chestnuts
which
had
been
selected
for
planting
at
godmersham
and
the
drawing
of
his
own
which
he
had
intended
to
carry
to
george
the
former
will
therefore
be
deposited
in
the
soil
of
hampshire
instead
of
kent
the
latter
i
have
already
consigned
to
another
element
we
have
been
exceedingly
busy
ever
since
you
went
away
in
the
first
place
we
have
had
to
rejoice
two
or
three
times
every
day
at
your
having
such
very
delightful
weather
for
the
whole
of
your
journey
and
in
the
second
place
we
have
been
obliged
to
take
advantage
of
the
very
delightful
weather
ourselves
by
going
to
see
almost
all
our
neighbours
on
thursday
we
walked
to
deane
yesterday
to
oakley
hall
and
oakley
and
to
deane
again
at
oakley
hall
we
did
a
great
deal
eat
some
sandwiches
all
over
mustard
admired
bramston
porter
and
transparencies
and
gained
a
promise
from
the
latter
of
two
roots
of
heartsease
one
all
yellow
and
the
other
all
purple
for
you
at
oakley
we
bought
ten
pair
of
worsted
stockings
and
a
shift
the
shift
is
for
betty
dawkins
as
we
find
she
wants
it
more
than
a
rug
she
is
one
of
the
most
grateful
of
all
whom
edward
charity
has
reached
or
at
least
she
expresses
herself
more
warmly
than
the
rest
for
she
sends
him
a
of
thanks
this
morning
we
called
at
the
harwoods
and
in
their
found
and
chute
for
ever
william
heathcote
and
chute
the
first
of
whom
took
a
long
ride
yesterday
morning
with
harwood
into
lord
carnarvon
park
and
fainted
away
in
the
evening
and
the
second
walked
down
from
oakley
hall
attended
by
augusta
bramston
they
had
meant
to
come
on
to
steventon
afterwards
but
we
knew
a
trick
worth
two
of
that
james
called
by
my
father
desire
on
bayle
to
inquire
into
the
cause
of
his
being
so
horrid
bayle
did
not
attempt
to
deny
his
being
horrid
and
made
many
apologies
for
it
he
did
not
plead
his
having
a
drunken
self
he
talked
only
of
a
drunken
foreman
and
gave
hopes
of
the
tables
being
at
steventon
on
monday
next
we
have
had
no
letter
since
you
left
us
except
one
from
serle
of
bishopstoke
to
inquire
the
character
of
james
elton
our
improvements
have
advanced
very
well
the
bank
along
the
is
sloped
down
for
the
reception
of
thorns
and
lilacs
and
it
is
settled
that
the
other
side
of
the
path
is
to
continue
turfed
and
to
be
planted
with
beech
ash
and
larch
steventon
saturday
november

written

am
sure
though
i
have
received
no
letter
from
you
since
your
leaving
london
the
post
and
not
yourself
must
have
been
unpunctual
we
have
at
last
heard
from
frank

letter
came
from
him
to
you
yesterday
and
i
mean
to
send
it

soon

a
frank
which
i
hope
to
do
in
a
day
or
two
you
must
rest
satisfied
with
knowing
that
on
the
of
july
the
with
the
rest
of
the
egyptian
squadron
was
off
the
isle
of
cyprus

went
from
jaffa
for
provisions
and
whence
they
were
to
sail
in
a
day
or

to
wait

result
of
the
english
proposals
for
the
evacuation

of
the
letter
according
to
the
present
fashionable
style
of
composition
is
chiefly
descriptive
of
his
promotion
he
knows
nothing
of
prizes
he
is
guiltless
did
you
think
of
our
ball
probably
at
basingstoke
on
thursday
evening
and
did
you
suppose
me
at
it
you
might
very
safely
for
there
i
was
on
wednesday
morning
it
was
settled
that
harwood
mary
and
i
should
go
together
and
shortly
afterwards
a
very
civil
note
of
invitation
for
me
came
from
bramston
who
wrote
i
believe
as
soon
as
she
knew
of
the
ball
i
might
likewise
have
gone
with
lefroy
and
therefore
with
three
methods
of
going
i
must
have
been
more
at
the
ball
than
anyone
else
i
dined
and
slept
at
deane
charlotte
and
i
did
my
hair
which
i
fancy
looked
very
indifferent
nobody
abused
it
however
and
i
retired
delighted
with
my
success
it
was
a
pleasant
ball
and
still
more
good
than
pleasant
for
there
were
nearly
sixty
people
and
sometimes
we
had
seventeen
couple
the
portsmouths
dorchesters
boltons
portals
and
clerks
were
there
and
all
the
meaner
and
more
usual
there
was
a
scarcity
of
men
in
general
and
a
still
greater
scarcity
of
any
that
were
good
for
much
i
danced
nine
dances
out
of
ten
five
with
stephen
terry
chute
and
james
digweed
and
four
with
catherine
there
was
commonly
a
couple
of
ladies
standing
up
together
but
not
often
any
so
amiable
as
ourselves
you
were
inquired
after
very
prettily
and
i
hope
the
whole
assembly
now
understands
that
you
are
gone
into
kent
which
the
families
in
general
seemed
to
meet
in
ignorance
of
lord
portsmouth
surpassed
the
rest
in
his
attentive
recollection
of
you
inquired
more
into
the
length
of
your
absence
and
concluded
by
desiring
to
be
to
you
when
i
wrote
next
lady
portsmouth
had
got
a
different
dress
on
and
lady
bolton
is
much
improved
by
a
wig
the
three
miss
terries
were
there
but
no
annie
which
was
a
great
disappointment
to
me
i
hope
the
poor
girl
had
not
set
her
heart
on
her
appearance
that
evening
so
much
as
i
had
terry
is
ill
in
a
very
low
way
i
said
civil
things
for
edward
to
chute
who
amply
returned
them
by
declaring
that
had
he
known
of
my
brother
being
at
steventon
he
should
have
made
a
point
of
calling
upon
him
to
thank
him
for
his
civility
about
the
hunt
steventon
saturday
evening
november
having
just
finished
veillées
du
i
think
it
a
good
opportunity
for
beginning
a
letter
to
you
while
my
mind
is
stored
with
ideas
worth
transmitting
i
thank
you
for
so
speedy
a
return
to
my
two
last
and
particularly
thank
you
for
your
anecdote
of
charlotte
graham
and
her
cousin
harriet
bailey
which
has
very
much
amused
both
my
mother
and
myself
if
you
can
learn
anything
farther
of
that
interesting
affair
i
hope
you
will
mention
it
i
have
two
messages
let
me
get
rid
of
them
and
then
my
paper
will
be
my
own
mary
fully
intended
writing
to
you
by
chute
frank
and
only
happened
entirely
to
forget
it
but
will
write
soon
and
my
father
wishes
edward
to
send
him
a
memorandum
in
your
next
letter
of
the
price
of
the
hops
the
tables
are
come
and
give
general
contentment
i
had
not
expected
that
they
would
so
perfectly
suit
the
fancy
of
us
all
three
or
that
we
should
so
well
agree
in
the
disposition
of
them
but
nothing
except
their
own
surface
can
have
been
smoother
the
two
ends
put
together
form
one
constant
table
for
everything
and
the
centre
piece
stands
exceedingly
well
under
the
glass
and
holds
a
great
deal
most
commodiously
without
looking
awkwardly
they
are
both
covered
with
green
baize
and
send
their
best
love
the
pembroke
has
got
its
destination
by
the
sideboard
and
my
mother
has
great
delight
in
keeping
her
money
and
papers
locked
up
the
little
table
which
used
to
stand
there
has
most
conveniently
taken
itself
off
into
the
best
bedroom
and
we
are
now
in
want
only
of
the
chiffonniere
which
is
neither
finished
nor
come
so
much
for
that
subject
i
now
come
to
another
of
a
very
different
nature
as
other
subjects
are
very
apt
to
be
earle
harwood
has
been
again
giving
uneasiness
to
his
family
and
talk
to
the
neighbourhood
in
the
present
instance
however
he
is
only
unfortunate
and
not
in
fault
about
ten
days
ago
in
cocking
a
pistol
in
the
at
marcau
he
accidentally
shot
himself
through
the
thigh
two
young
scotch
surgeons
in
the
island
were
polite
enough
to
propose
taking
off
the
thigh
at
once
but
to
that
he
would
not
consent
and
accordingly
in
his
wounded
state
was
put
on
board
a
cutter
and
conveyed
to
haslar
hospital
at
gosport
where
the
bullet
was
extracted
and
where
he
now
is
i
hope
in
a
fair
way
of
doing
well
the
surgeon
of
the
hospital
wrote
to
the
family
on
the
occasion
and
john
harwood
went
down
to
him
immediately
attended
by
james
whose
object
in
going
was
to
be
the
means
of
bringing
back
the
earliest
intelligence
to
and
harwood
whose
anxious
sufferings
particularly
those
of
the
latter
have
of
course
been
dreadful
they
went
down
on
tuesday
and
james
came
back
the
next
day
bringing
such
favourable
accounts
as
greatly
to
lessen
the
distress
of
the
family
at
deane
though
it
will
probably
be
a
long
while
before
harwood
can
be
quite
at
ease
most
material
comfort
however
they
have
the
assurance
of
its
being
really
an
accidental
wound
which
is
not
only
positively
declared
by
earle
himself
but
is
likewise
testified
by
the
particular
direction
of
the
bullet
such
a
wound
could
not
have
been
received
in
a
duel
at
present
he
is
going
on
very
well
but
the
surgeon
will
not
declare
him
to
be
in
no
danger
james
had
not
time
at
gosport
to
take
any
other
steps
towards
seeing
charles
than
the
very
few
which
conducted
him
to
the
door
of
the
assembly
room
in
the
inn
where
there
happened
to
be
a
ball
on
the
night
of
their
arrival
a
likely
spot
enough
for
the
discovery
of
a
charles
but
i
am
glad
to
say
that
he
was
not
of
the
party
for
it
was
in
general
a
very
ungenteel
one
and
there
was
hardly
a
pretty
girl
in
the
room
yesterday
was
a
day
of
great
business
with
me
mary
drove
me
all
in
the
rain
to
basingstoke
and
still
more
all
in
the
rain
back
again
because
it
rained
harder
and
soon
after
our
return
to
deane
a
sudden
invitation
and
an
own
postchaise
took
us
to
ashe
park
to
dine
with
holder
gauntlet
and
james
digweed
but
our
was
cruelly
reduced
by
the
of
the
two
latter
we
had
a
very
quiet
evening
i
believe
mary
found
it
dull
but
i
thought
it
very
pleasant
to
sit
in
idleness
over
a
good
fire
in
a
room
is
a
luxurious
sensation
sometimes
we
talked
and
sometimes
we
were
quite
silent
i
said
two
or
three
amusing
things
and
holder
made
a
few
infamous
puns
heathcote
met
with
a
genteel
little
accident
the
other
day
in
hunting
he
got
off
to
lead
his
horse
over
a
hedge
or
a
house
or
something
and
his
horse
in
his
haste
trod
upon
his
leg
or
rather
ancle
i
believe
and
it
is
not
certain
whether
the
small
bone
is
not
broke
martha
has
accepted
mary
invitation
for
lord
portsmouth
ball
he
has
not
yet
sent
out
his
invitations
but
does
not
signify
martha
comes
and
a
ball
there
must
be
i
think
it
will
be
too
early
in
her
mother
absence
for
me
to
return
with
her
we
have
had
a
dreadful
storm
of
wind
in
the
fore
part
of
this
day
which
has
done
a
great
deal
of
mischief
among
our
trees
i
was
sitting
alone
in
the
when
an
odd
kind
of
crash
startled
me
in
a
moment
afterwards
it
was
repeated
descend
into
the
sweep
the
other
which
had
fallen
i
suppose
in
the
first
crash
and
which
was
the
nearest
to
the
pond
taking
a
more
easterly
direction
sunk
among
our
screen
of
chestnuts
and
firs
knocking
down
one
beating
off
the
head
of
another
and
stripping
the
two
corner
chestnuts
of
several
branches
in
its
fall
this
is
not
all
one
large
elm
out
of
the
two
on
the
side
as
you
enter
what
i
call
the
elm
walk
was
likewise
blown
down
the
maypole
bearing
the
weathercock
was
broke
in
two
and
what
i
regret
more
than
all
the
rest
is
that
all
the
three
elms
which
grew
in
hall
meadow
and
gave
such
ornament
to
it
are
gone
two
were
blown
down
and
the
other
so
much
injured
that
it
can
not
stand
i
am
happy
to
add
however
that
no
greater
evil
than
the
loss
of
trees
has
been
the
consequence
of
the
storm
in
this
place
or
in
our
immediate
neighbourhood
we
grieve
therefore
in
some
comfort
holder
paper
tells
us
that
some
time
in
last
august
captain
austen
and
the
were
very
active
in
securing
a
turkish
ship
driven
into
port
in
cyprus
by
bad
weather
from
the
french
he
was
forced
to
burn
her
however
i
am
yours
ever
j
a
next
in
order
comes
a
letter
to
martha
lloyd
steventon
wednesday
evening
november
my
dear
martha
i
did
not
receive
your
note
yesterday
till
after
charlotte
had
left
deane
or
i
would
have
sent
my
answer
by
her
instead
of
being
the
means
as
i
now
must
be
of
lessening
the
elegance
of
your
new
dress
for
the
hurstbourne
ball
by
the
value
of
you
are
very
good
in
wishing
to
see
me
at
ibthorp
so
soon
and
i
am
equally
good
in
wishing
to
come
to
you
i
believe
our
merit
in
that
respect
is
much
upon
a
par
our
mutually
strong
having
paid
this
tribute
of
praise
to
the
virtue
of
both
i
shall
here
have
done
with
panegyric
and
proceed
to
plain
matter
of
fact
in
about
a
fortnight
time
i
hope
to
be
with
you
i
have
two
reasons
for
not
being
able
to
come
before
i
wish
so
to
arrange
my
visit
as
to
spend
some
days
with
you
after
your
mother
return
in
the
place
that
i
may
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
and
in
the
that
i
may
have
a
better
chance
of
bringing
you
back
with
me
your
promise
in
my
favour
was
not
quite
absolute
but
if
your
will
is
not
perverse
you
and
i
will
do
all
in
our
power
to
overcome
your
scruples
of
conscience
i
hope
we
shall
meet
next
week
to
talk
all
this
over
till
we
have
tired
ourselves
with
the
very
idea
of
my
visit
before
my
visit
begins
our
invitations
for
the
are
arrived
and
very
curiously
are
they
worded
mary
mentioned
to
you
yesterday
poor
unfortunate
accident
i
dare
say
he
does
not
seem
to
be
going
on
very
well
the
two
or
three
last
posts
have
brought
less
and
less
favourable
accounts
of
him
john
harwood
has
gone
to
gosport
again
we
have
two
families
of
friends
now
who
are
in
a
most
anxious
state
for
though
by
a
note
from
catherine
this
morning
there
seems
now
to
be
a
revival
of
hope
at
manydown
its
continuance
may
be
too
reasonably
doubted
heathcote
however
who
has
broken
the
small
bone
of
his
leg
is
so
good
as
to
be
going
on
very
well
it
would
be
really
too
much
to
have
three
people
to
care
for
you
distress
me
cruelly
by
your
request
about
books
i
can
not
think
of
any
to
bring
with
me
nor
have
i
any
idea
of
our
wanting
them
i
come
to
you
to
be
talked
to
not
to
read
or
hear
reading
i
can
do
that
at
home
and
indeed
i
am
now
laying
in
a
stock
of
intelligence
to
pour
out
on
you
as
my
share
of
the
conversation
i
am
reading
henry
of
which
i
will
repeat
to
you
in
any
manner
you
may
prefer
either
in
a
loose
desultory
unconnected
stream
or
dividing
my
recital
as
the
historian
divides
it
himself
into
seven
parts
the
civil
and
military
religion
constitution
learning
and
learned
men
arts
and
sciences
commerce
coins
and
shipping
and
manners
so
that
for
every
evening
in
the
week
there
will
be
a
different
subject
the
friday
lot
commerce
coins
and
shipping
you
will
find
the
least
entertaining
but
the
next
evening
portion
will
make
amends
with
such
a
provision
on
my
part
if
you
will
do
yours
by
repeating
the
french
grammar
and
stent
will
now
and
then
ejaculate
some
wonder
about
the
cocks
and
hens
what
can
we
want
farewell
for
a
short
time
we
all
unite
in
best
love
and
i
am
your
very
affectionate
j
a
the
hurstbourne
ball
took
place
on
november
and
was
graced
by
the
presence
of
lieutenant
charles
austen
he
had
distinguished
himself
on
the
especially
in
the
capture
of
the
in
a
heavy
gale
his
ship
was
now
at
portsmouth
waiting
for
orders
steventon
thursday
november
my
dear
cassandra
your
letter
took
me
quite
by
surprise
this
morning
you
are
very
welcome
however
and
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
i
believe
i
drank
too
much
wine
last
night
at
hurstbourne
i
know
not
how
else
to
account
for
the
shaking
of
my
hand
you
will
kindly
make
allowance
therefore
for
any
indistinctness
of
writing
by
attributing
it
to
this
venial
error
naughty
charles
did
not
come
on
tuesday
but
good
charles
came
yesterday
morning
about
two
he
walked
in
on
a
gosport
hack
his
feeling
equal
to
such
a
fatigue
is
a
good
sign
and
his
feeling
no
fatigue
in
it
a
still
better
he
walked
down
to
deane
to
dinner
he
danced
the
whole
evening
and
is
no
more
tired
than
a
gentleman
ought
to
be
your
desire
to
hear
from
me
on
sunday
will
perhaps
bring
you
a
more
particular
account
of
the
ball
than
you
may
care
for
because
one
is
prone
to
think
much
more
of
such
things
the
morning
after
they
happen
than
when
time
has
entirely
driven
them
out
of
one
recollection
it
was
a
pleasant
evening
charles
found
it
remarkably
so
but
i
can
not
tell
why
unless
the
absence
of
miss
terry
towards
whom
his
conscience
reproaches
him
with
being
now
perfectly
indifferent
was
a
relief
to
him
there
were
only
twelve
dances
of
which
i
danced
nine
and
was
merely
prevented
from
dancing
the
rest
by
the
want
of
a
partner
we
began
at
ten
supped
at
one
and
were
at
deane
before
five
there
were
but
fifty
people
in
the
room
very
few
families
indeed
from
our
side
of
the
county
and
not
many
more
from
the
other
my
partners
were
the
two
johns
hooper
holder
and
very
prodigious
mathew
with
whom
i
called
the
last
and
whom
i
liked
the
best
of
my
little
stock
there
were
very
few
beauties
and
such
as
there
were
not
very
handsome
miss
iremonger
did
not
look
well
and
blount
was
the
only
one
much
admired
she
appeared
exactly
as
she
did
in
september
with
the
same
broad
face
diamond
bandeau
white
shoes
pink
husband
and
fat
neck
the
two
miss
coxes
were
there
i
traced
in
one
the
remains
of
the
vulgar
girl
who
danced
at
enham
eight
years
ago
the
other
is
refined
into
a
nice
girl
like
catherine
bigg
i
looked
at
sir
thomas
champneys
and
thought
of
poor
rosalie
i
looked
at
his
daughter
and
thought
her
a
queer
animal
with
a
white
neck
mary
said
that
i
looked
very
well
last
night
i
wore
my
aunt
gown
and
handkerchief
and
my
hair
was
at
least
tidy
which
was
all
my
ambition
i
will
now
have
done
with
the
ball
and
i
will
moreover
go
and
dress
for
dinner
the
young
lady
whom
it
is
expected
that
sir
thomas
is
to
marry
is
miss
emma
wabshaw
she
lives
somewhere
between
southampton
and
winchester
is
handsome
accomplished
amiable
and
everything
but
rich
he
is
certainly
finishing
his
house
in
a
great
hurry
perhaps
the
report
of
his
being
to
marry
a
miss
fanshawe
might
originate
in
his
attentions
to
this
very
lady
the
names
are
not
unlike
the
three
digweeds
all
came
on
tuesday
and
we
played
a
pool
at
commerce
james
digweed
left
hampshire
i
think
he
must
be
in
love
with
you
from
his
anxiety
to
have
you
go
to
the
faversham
balls
and
likewise
from
his
supposition
that
the
two
elms
fell
from
their
grief
at
your
absence
was
not
it
a
gallant
idea
it
never
occurred
to
me
before
but
i
dare
say
it
was
so
i
rejoice
to
say
that
we
have
just
had
another
letter
from
our
dear
frank
it
is
to
you
very
short
written
from
larnica
in
cyprus
and
so
lately
as
october
he
came
from
alexandria
and
was
to
return
there
in
three
or
four
days
knew
nothing
of
his
promotion
and
does
not
write
above
twenty
lines
from
a
doubt
of
the
ever
reaching
you
and
an
idea
of
all
letters
being
opened
at
vienna
he
wrote
a
few
days
before
to
you
from
alexandria
by
the
sent
with
despatches
to
lord
keith
another
letter
must
be
owing
to
us
besides
this
if
not
because
none
of
these
are
to
me
henry
comes
for
one
night
only
the
visit
to
ibthorp
came
off
as
is
shown
by
the
following
letter
ibthorp
sunday
november
my
dear
cassandra
shall
you
expect
to
hear
from
me
on
wednesday
or
not
i
think
you
will
or
i
should
not
write
as
the
three
days
and
half
which
have
passed
since
my
last
letter
have
not
produced
many
materials
towards
filling
another
sheet
of
paper
but
like
hastings
do
not
despair
and
you
perhaps
like
the
faithful
maria
may
feel
still
more
certain
of
the
happy
event
i
have
been
here
ever
since
a
quarter
after
three
on
thursday
last
by
the
shrewsbury
clock
which
i
am
fortunately
enabled
absolutely
to
ascertain
because
stent
once
lived
at
shrewsbury
or
at
least
at
tewksbury
i
have
the
pleasure
of
thinking
myself
a
very
welcome
guest
and
the
pleasure
of
spending
my
time
very
pleasantly
martha
looks
well
and
wants
me
to
find
out
that
she
grows
fat
but
i
can
not
carry
my
complaisance
farther
than
to
believe
whatever
she
asserts
on
the
subject
stent
gives
us
quite
as
much
of
her
company
as
we
wish
for
and
rather
more
than
she
used
to
do
but
perhaps
not
more
than
is
to
our
advantage
in
the
end
because
it
is
too
dirty
even
for
such
desperate
walkers
as
martha
and
i
to
get
out
of
doors
and
we
are
therefore
confined
to
each
other
society
from
morning
till
night
with
very
little
variety
of
books
or
gowns
three
of
the
miss
debaries
called
here
the
morning
after
my
arrival
but
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
return
their
civility
you
know
it
is
not
an
uncommon
circumstance
in
this
parish
to
have
the
road
from
ibthorp
to
the
parsonage
much
dirtier
and
more
impracticable
for
walking
than
the
road
from
the
parsonage
to
ibthorp
i
left
my
mother
very
well
when
i
came
away
and
left
her
with
strict
orders
to
continue
so
the
endless
debaries
are
of
course
very
well
acquainted
with
the
lady
who
is
to
marry
sir
thomas
and
all
her
family
i
pardon
them
however
as
their
description
of
her
is
favourable
wapshire
is
a
widow
with
several
sons
and
daughters
a
good
fortune
and
a
house
in
salisbury
where
miss
wapshire
has
been
for
many
years
a
distinguished
beauty
she
is
now
seven
or
eight
and
twenty
and
tho
still
handsome
less
handsome
than
she
has
been
this
promises
better
than
the
bloom
of
seventeen
and
in
addition
to
this
they
say
that
she
has
always
been
remarkable
for
the
propriety
of
her
behaviour
distinguishing
her
far
above
the
general
classes
of
town
misses
and
rendering
her
of
course
very
unpopular
among
them
martha
has
promised
to
return
with
me
and
our
plan
is
to
have
a
nice
black
frost
for
walking
to
whitchurch
and
then
throw
ourselves
into
a
post
chaise
one
upon
the
other
our
heads
hanging
out
at
one
door
and
our
feet
at
the
opposite
one
if
you
have
never
heard
that
miss
dawes
has
been
married
these
two
months
i
will
mention
it
in
my
next
pray
do
not
forget
to
go
to
the
canterbury
ball
i
shall
despise
you
all
most
insufferably
if
you
do
i
have
charged
my
myrmidons
to
send
me
an
account
of
the
basingstoke
ball
i
have
placed
my
spies
at
different
places
that
they
may
collect
the
more
and
by
so
doing
by
sending
miss
bigg
to
the
itself
and
posting
my
mother
at
steventon
i
hope
to
derive
from
their
various
observations
a
good
general
idea
of
the
whole
miss
austen
yours
ever
godmersham
park
j
faversham
kent
while
jane
was
away
on
this
visit
and
austen
came
to
a
momentous
decision
namely
to
leave
steventon
and
retire
to
bath
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
decision
was
a
hasty
one
some
of
previous
letters
contain
details
of
the
very
considerable
improvements
that
her
father
had
just
begun
in
the
rectory
garden
and
we
do
not
hear
that
these
improvements
were
concerted
with
the
son
who
was
to
be
his
successor
so
hasty
indeed
did
austen
decision
appear
to
the
perrots
that
they
suspected
the
reason
to
be
a
growing
attachment
between
jane
and
one
of
the
three
digweed
brothers
there
is
not
the
slightest
evidence
of
this
very
improbable
supposition
in
letters
though
she
occasionally
suggest
that
james
digweed
must
be
in
love
with
cassandra
especially
when
he
gallantly
supposed
that
the
two
elms
had
fallen
from
grief
at
her
absence
on
the
whole
it
seems
most
probable
that
austen
continued
was
the
reason
for
the
change
tradition
says
that
when
jane
returned
home
accompanied
by
martha
lloyd
the
news
was
abruptly
announced
by
her
mother
who
thus
greeted
them
girls
it
is
all
settled
we
have
decided
to
leave
steventon
in
such
a
week
and
go
to
bath
and
that
the
shock
of
the
intelligence
was
so
great
to
jane
that
she
fainted
away
unfortunately
there
is
no
further
direct
evidence
to
show
how
far
jane
feelings
resembled
those
she
has
attributed
to
marianne
dashwood
on
leaving
norland
but
we
have
the
negative
evidence
arising
from
the
fact
that
none
of
her
letters
are
preserved
between
november
and
january
although
cassandra
was
at
godmersham
during
the
whole
of
the
intervening
month
silence
on
the
part
of
jane
to
cassandra
for
so
long
a
period
of
absence
is
unheard
of
and
according
to
the
rule
acted
on
by
cassandra
destruction
of
her
sister
letters
was
a
proof
of
their
emotional
interest
we
can
not
doubt
therefore
that
she
wrote
in
a
strain
unusual
for
her
more
than
once
in
that
month
but
as
she
says
of
elizabeth
bennet
was
her
business
to
be
satisfied
and
certainly
her
temper
to
be
happy
and
the
next
letter
that
we
have
shows
that
she
was
determined
to
face
a
new
life
in
a
new
place
with
cheerfulness
steventon
saturday
january
my
dear
cassandra
my
mother
looks
forward
with
as
much
certainty
as
you
can
do
to
our
keeping
two
maids
my
father
is
the
only
one
not
in
the
secret
we
plan
having
a
steady
cook
and
a
young
giddy
housemaid
with
a
sedate
man
who
is
to
undertake
the
double
office
of
husband
to
the
former
and
sweetheart
to
the
latter
there
are
three
parts
of
bath
which
we
have
thought
of
as
likely
to
have
houses
in
them
westgate
buildings
charles
street
and
some
of
the
short
streets
leading
from
laura
place
or
pulteney
street
westgate
buildings
though
quite
in
the
lower
part
of
the
town
are
not
badly
situated
themselves
the
street
is
broad
and
has
rather
a
good
appearance
charles
street
however
i
think
is
preferable
the
buildings
are
new
and
its
nearness
to
kingsmead
fields
would
be
a
pleasant
circumstance
perhaps
you
may
remember
or
perhaps
you
may
forget
that
charles
street
leads
from
the
queen
square
chapel
to
the
two
green
park
streets
the
houses
in
the
streets
near
laura
place
i
should
expect
to
be
above
our
price
gay
street
would
be
too
high
except
only
the
lower
house
on
the
side
as
you
ascend
towards
that
my
mother
has
no
disinclination
it
used
to
be
lower
rented
than
any
other
house
in
the
row
from
some
inferiority
in
the
apartments
but
above
all
others
her
wishes
are
at
present
fixed
on
the
corner
house
in
chapel
row
which
opens
into
prince
street
her
knowledge
of
it
however
is
confined
only
to
the
outside
and
therefore
she
is
equally
uncertain
of
its
being
really
desirable
as
of
its
being
to
be
had
in
the
meantime
she
assures
you
that
she
will
do
everything
in
her
power
to
avoid
trim
street
although
you
have
not
expressed
the
fearful
presentiment
of
it
which
was
rather
expected
we
know
that
perrot
will
want
to
get
us
into
oxford
buildings
but
we
all
unite
in
particular
dislike
of
that
part
of
the
town
and
therefore
hope
to
escape
upon
all
these
different
situations
you
and
edward
may
confer
together
and
your
opinion
of
each
will
be
expected
with
eagerness
i
have
now
attained
the
true
art
of
which
we
are
always
told
is
to
express
on
paper
exactly
what
one
would
say
to
the
same
person
by
word
of
mouth
i
have
been
talking
to
you
almost
as
fast
as
i
could
the
whole
of
this
letter
my
mother
bargains
for
having
no
trouble
at
all
in
furnishing
our
house
in
bath
and
i
have
engaged
for
your
willingly
undertaking
to
do
it
all
i
get
more
and
more
reconciled
to
the
idea
of
our
removal
we
have
lived
long
enough
in
this
neighbourhood
the
basingstoke
balls
are
certainly
on
the
decline
there
is
something
interesting
in
the
bustle
of
going
away
and
the
prospect
of
spending
future
summers
by
the
sea
or
in
wales
is
very
delightful
for
a
time
we
shall
now
possess
many
of
the
advantages
which
i
have
often
thought
of
with
envy
in
the
wives
of
sailors
or
soldiers
it
must
not
be
generally
known
however
that
i
am
not
sacrificing
a
great
deal
in
quitting
the
country
or
i
can
expect
to
inspire
no
tenderness
no
interest
in
those
we
leave
behind
the
threatened
act
of
parliament
does
not
seem
to
give
any
alarm
my
father
is
doing
all
in
his
power
to
increase
his
income
by
raising
his
tithes
and
i
do
not
despair
of
getting
very
nearly
six
hundred
a
year
steventon
thursday
january
peter
debary
has
declined
deane
curacy
he
wishes
to
be
settled
near
london
a
foolish
reason
as
if
deane
were
not
near
london
in
comparison
of
exeter
or
york
take
the
whole
world
through
and
he
will
find
many
more
places
at
a
greater
distance
from
london
than
deane
than
he
will
at
a
less
what
does
he
think
of
glencoe
or
lake
katherine
i
feel
rather
indignant
that
any
possible
objection
should
be
raised
against
so
valuable
a
piece
of
preferment
so
delightful
a
situation
that
deane
should
not
be
universally
allowed
to
be
as
near
the
metropolis
as
any
other
country
villages
as
this
is
the
case
however
as
peter
debary
has
shown
himself
a
peter
in
the
blackest
sense
of
the
word
we
are
obliged
to
look
elsewhere
for
an
heir
and
my
father
has
thought
it
a
necessary
compliment
to
james
digweed
to
offer
the
curacy
to
him
though
without
considering
it
as
either
a
desirable
or
an
eligible
situation
for
him
eliza
has
seen
lord
craven
at
barton
and
probably
by
this
time
at
kintbury
where
he
was
expected
for
one
day
this
week
she
found
his
manners
very
pleasing
indeed
the
little
flaw
of
having
a
mistress
now
living
with
him
at
ashdown
park
seems
to
be
the
only
unpleasing
circumstance
about
him
from
ibthorp
fulwar
and
eliza
are
to
return
with
james
and
mary
to
deane
pray
give
my
love
to
george
tell
him
that
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
he
can
skip
so
well
already
and
that
i
hope
he
will
continue
to
send
me
word
of
his
improvement
in
the
art
sidmouth
is
now
talked
of
as
our
summer
abode
get
all
the
information
therefore
about
it
that
you
can
from
cage
my
father
old
ministers
are
already
deserting
him
to
pay
their
court
to
his
son
the
brown
mare
which
as
well
as
the
black
was
to
devolve
on
james
at
our
removal
has
not
had
patience
to
wait
for
that
and
has
settled
herself
even
now
at
deane
the
death
of
hugh
capet
which
like
that
of
skipsey
though
undesired
was
not
wholly
unexpected
being
purposely
effected
has
made
the
immediate
possession
of
the
mare
very
convenient
and
everything
else
i
suppose
will
be
seized
by
degrees
in
the
same
manner
martha
and
i
work
at
the
books
every
day
steventon
wednesday
january
your
letter
to
mary
was
duly
received
before
she
left
deane
with
martha
yesterday
morning
and
it
gives
us
great
pleasure
to
know
that
the
chilham
ball
was
so
agreeable
and
that
you
danced
four
dances
with
kemble
desirable
however
as
the
latter
circumstance
was
i
can
not
help
wondering
at
its
taking
place
why
did
you
dance
four
dances
with
so
stupid
a
man
why
not
rather
dance
two
of
them
with
some
elegant
brother
officer
who
was
struck
with
your
appearance
as
soon
as
you
entered
the
room
at
present
the
environs
of
laura
place
seem
to
be
his
my
father
choice
his
views
on
the
subject
are
much
advanced
since
i
came
home
he
grows
quite
ambitious
and
actually
requires
now
a
comfortable
and
a
house
this
morning
brought
my
aunt
reply
and
most
thoroughly
affectionate
is
its
tenor
she
thinks
with
the
greatest
pleasure
of
our
being
settled
in
bath
it
is
an
event
which
will
attach
her
to
the
place
more
than
anything
else
could
do
she
is
moreover
very
urgent
with
my
mother
not
to
delay
her
visit
in
paragon
if
she
should
continue
unwell
and
even
recommends
her
spending
the
whole
winter
with
them
at
present
and
for
many
days
past
my
mother
has
been
quite
stout
and
she
wishes
not
to
be
obliged
by
any
relapse
to
alter
her
arrangements
mention
is
made
in
several
letters
of
frank
promotion
and
his
ignorance
of
it
in
while
commanding
the
sloop
he
had
been
entrusted
by
lord
vincent
with
dispatches
conveying
to
nelson
at
palermo
the
startling
news
of
admiral
bruix
escape
from
brest
with
a
considerable
fleet
and
his
entry
into
the
mediterranean
so
important
did
francis
austen
believe
this
intelligence
to
be
that
he
landed
his
first
lieutenant
with
the
dispatches
on
the
coast
of
sicily
some
way
short
of
palermo
the
wind
being
unfavourable
for
the
approach
to
the
capital
by
sea
nelson
next
employed
him
in
taking
orders
to
the
squadron
blockading
malta
frank
spent
the
autumn
and
winter
cruising
about
the
mediterranean
and
taking
various
prizes
the
most
important
capture
being
that
of
the
a
french
national
brig
convoying
two
vessels
laden
with
corn
for
the
french
forces
in
egypt
this
exploit
took
place
in
march
and
was
considered
of
such
importance
that
he
was
made
a
for
it
but
so
slow
and
uncertain
was
communication
to
and
from
the
seat
of
war
that
he
knew
nothing
of
his
promotion
till
october
long
after
his
friends
at
home
had
become
acquainted
with
it
his
being
and
thrust
out
of
the
by
captain
inglis
his
successor
is
of
course
a
graphic
way
of
describing
his
change
of
vessel
and
promotion
steventon
wednesday
january
my
dear
cassandra
expect
a
most
agreeable
letter
for
not
being
overburdened
with
subject
having
nothing
at
all
to
say
i
shall
have
no
check
to
my
genius
from
beginning
to
end
well
and
so
frank
letter
has
made
you
very
happy
but
you
are
afraid
he
would
not
have
patience
to
stay
for
the
which
you
wish
him
to
have
done
as
being
safer
than
the
merchantman
poor
fellow
to
wait
from
the
middle
of
november
to
the
end
of
december
and
perhaps
even
longer
it
must
be
sad
work
especially
in
a
place
where
the
ink
is
so
abominably
pale
what
a
surprise
to
him
it
must
have
been
on
october
to
be
visited
collared
and
thrust
out
of
the
by
captain
inglis
he
kindly
passes
over
the
poignancy
of
his
feelings
in
quitting
his
ship
his
officers
and
his
men
what
a
pity
it
is
that
he
should
not
be
in
england
at
the
time
of
his
promotion
because
he
certainly
would
have
had
an
appointment
so
everybody
says
and
therefore
it
must
be
right
for
me
to
say
it
too
had
he
been
really
here
the
certainty
of
the
appointment
i
dare
say
would
not
have
been
half
so
great
but
as
it
could
not
be
brought
to
the
proof
his
absence
will
be
always
a
lucky
source
of
regret
eliza

of
having
read
in
a
newspaper
that
all
the
first
lieutenants
of

were

into

were
to

promoted
to

him
under
that
denomination

join
with
you

wishing

do
not
venture
to
expect

your
unfortunate
sister
was
betrayed
last
thursday
into
a
situation
of
the
utmost
cruelty
i
arrived
at
ashe
park
before
the
party
from
deane
and
was
shut
up
in
the
with
holder
alone
for
ten
minutes
i
had
some
thoughts
of
insisting
on
the
housekeeper
or
mary
corbett
being
sent
for
and
nothing
could
prevail
on
me
to
move
two
steps
from
the
door
on
the
lock
of
which
i
kept
one
hand
constantly
fixed
we
met
nobody
but
ourselves
played
at
again
and
were
very
cross
your
brother
edward
makes
very
honourable
mention
of
you
i
assure
you
in
his
letter
to
james
and
seems
quite
sorry
to
part
with
you
it
is
a
great
comfort
to
me
to
think
that
my
cares
have
not
been
thrown
away
and
that
you
are
respected
in
the
world
perhaps
you
may
be
prevailed
on
to
return
with
him
and
elizabeth
into
kent
when
they
leave
us
in
april
and
i
rather
suspect
that
your
great
wish
of
keeping
yourself
disengaged
has
been
with
that
view
do
as
you
like
i
have
overcome
my
desire
of
your
going

will
not
bring

it
necessary
to
write

you

soon

for
the
arrival
of
a
letter
from

it
was
written
last
saturday
from
off
the

conveyed
to

he
met

inglis
at
rhodes
going
up
to
take
command
of
the

he
was
coming
down
but
supposes
he
will
arrive
in
less
than
a
fortnight
from
this
time
in
some
ship
which
is
expected
to
reach
england
about
that
time
with

from

were

well
satisfied
with
their
royal

whom
they
found
jolly
fat
and
affable
who
talks
of
lady
augusta
as
his
wife
and
seems
much
attached
to
her
when
this
letter
was
written
the
was
becalmed
but
charles
hoped
to
reach
portsmouth
by
monday
or
tuesday
he
received
my
letter
communicating
our
plans
before
he
left
england
was
much
surprised
of
course
but
is
quite
reconciled
to
them
and

to
come

steventon
once
more
while
steventon
is
ours
after
this
we
have
no
letters
of
jane
till
she
wrote
from
bath
so
we
may
suppose
that
the
sisters
were
soon
united
the
months
of
march
and
april
were
spent
in
making
the
final
preparations
for
leaving
steventon
and
in
receiving
farewell

from

his

tuesday
may
my
dear
cassandra
our
journey
here
was
perfectly
free
from
accident
or
event
we
changed
horses
at
the
end
of
every
stage
and
paid
at
almost
every
turnpike
we
had
charming
weather
hardly
any
dust
and
were
exceedingly
agreeable
as
we
did
not
speak
above
once
in
three
miles
we
had
a
very
neat
chaise
from
devizes
it
looked
almost
as
well
as
a
gentleman
at
least
as
a
very
shabby
gentleman
in
spite
of
this
advantage
however
we
were
above
three
hours
coming
from
thence
to
paragon
and
it
was
half
after
seven
by
your
clocks
before
we
entered
the
house
frank
whose
black
head
was
in
waiting
in
the
hall
window
received
us
very
kindly
and
his
master
and
mistress
did
not
show
less
cordiality
they
both
look
very
well
though
my
aunt
has
a
violent
cough
we
drank
tea
as
soon
as
we
arrived
and
so
ends
the
account
of
our
journey
which
my
mother
bore
without
any
fatigue
there
is
to
be
only
one
more
ball
next
monday
is
the
day
the
chamberlaynes
are
still
here
i
begin
to
think
better
of
and
upon
recollection
believe
she
has
rather
a
long
chin
than
otherwise
as
she
remembers
us
in
gloucestershire
when
we
were
very
charming
young
women
the
first
view
of
bath
in
fine
weather
does
not
answer
my
expectations
i
think
i
see
more
distinctly
through
rain
the
sun
was
got
behind
everything
and
the
appearance
of
the
place
from
the
top
of
kingsdown
was
all
vapour
shadow
smoke
and
confusion
i
fancy
we
are
to
have
a
house
in
seymour
street
or
thereabouts
my
uncle
and
aunt
both
like
the
situation
i
was
glad
to
hear
the
former
talk
of
all
the
houses
in
new
king
street
as
too
small
it
was
my
own
idea
of
them
i
had
not
been
two
minutes
in
the
before
he
questioned
me
with
all
his
accustomary
eager
interest
about
frank
and
charles
their
views
and
intentions
i
did
my
best
to
give
information
when
my
uncle
went
to
take
his
second
glass
of
water
i
walked
with
him
and
in
our
morning
circuit
we
looked
at
two
houses
in
green
park
buildings
one
of
which
pleased
me
very
well
we
walked
all
over
it
except
into
the
garret
the
is
of
a
comfortable
size
just
as
large
as
you
like
to
fancy
it
the
second
room
about
square
the
apartment
over
the
pleased
me
particularly
because
it
is
divided
into
two
the
smaller
one
a
very
which
upon
occasion
might
admit
a
bed
the
aspect
is
the
only
doubt
is
about
the
dampness
of
the
offices
of
which
there
were

really
expected

am
more
anxious
to
know
the
amount
of
my
books
especially
as
they
are
said
to
have
sold
well
in
the
evening
i
hope
you
honoured
my
toilette
and
ball
with
a
thought
i
dressed
myself
as
well
as
i
could
and
had
all
my
finery
much
admired
at
home
by
nine
my
uncle
aunt
and
i
entered
the
rooms
and
linked
miss
winstone
on
to
us
before
tea
it
was
rather
a
dull
affair
but
then
the
before
tea
did
not
last
long
for
there
was
only
one
dance
danced
by
four
couple
think
of
four
couple
surrounded
by
about
an
hundred
people
dancing
in
the
upper
rooms
at
bath
after
tea
we
the
breaking
up
of
private
parties
sent
some
scores
more
to
the
ball
and
though
it
was
shockingly
and
inhumanly
thin
for
this
place
there
were
people
enough
i
suppose
to
have
made
five
or
six
very
pretty
basingstoke
assemblies
i
then
got
evelyn
to
talk
to
and
miss
to
look
at
and
i
am
proud
to
say
that
though
repeatedly
assured
that
another
in
the
same
party
was
the
i
fixed
upon
the
right
one
from
the
first
a
resemblance
to
was
my
guide
she
is
not
so
pretty
as
i
expected
her
face
has
the
same
defect
of
baldness
as
her
sister
and
her
features
not
so
handsome
she
was
highly
rouged
and
looked
rather
quietly
and
contentedly
silly
than
anything
else
and
two
young
women
were
of
the
same
party
except
when
thought
herself
obliged
to
leave
them
to
run
round
the
room
after
her
drunken
husband
his
avoidance
and
her
pursuit
with
the
probable
intoxication
of
both
was
an
amusing
scene
another
stupid
party
last
night
perhaps
if
larger
they
might
be
less
intolerable
but
here
there
were
only
just
enough
to
make
one
card
table
with
six
people
to
look
on
and
talk
nonsense
to
each
other
lady
fust
busby
and
a
owen
sat
down
with
my
uncle
to
whist
within
five
minutes
after
the
three
old
came
in
and
there
they
sat
with
only
the
exchange
of
stanhope
for
my
uncle
till
their
chairs
were
announced
i
can
not
anyhow
continue
to
find
people
agreeable
i
respect
chamberlayne
for
doing
her
hair
well
but
can
not
feel
a
more
tender
sentiment
miss
langley
is
like
any
other
short
girl
with
a
broad
nose
and
wide
mouth
fashionable

and
exposed

stanhope
is
a
gentlemanlike
man

then
his
legs
are
too
short

his
tail
too
long
paragon
thursday
may
the
friendship
between
chamberlayne
and
me
which
you
predicted
has
already
taken
place
for
we
shake
hands
whenever
we
meet
our
grand
walk
to
weston
was
again
fixed
for
yesterday
and
was
accomplished
in
a
very
striking
manner
every
one
of
the
party
declined
it
under
some
pretence
or
other
except
our
two
selves
and
we
had
therefore
a
but
we
should
equally
have
had
after
the
first
two
yards
had
half
the
inhabitants
of
bath
set
off
with
us
it
would
have
amused
you
to
see
our
progress
we
went
up
by
sion
hill
and
returned
across
the
fields
in
climbing
a
hill
chamberlayne
is
very
capital
i
could
with
difficulty
keep
pace
with
her
yet
would
not
flinch
for
the
world
on
plain
ground
i
was
quite
her
equal
and
so
we
posted
away
under
a
fine
hot
sun
without
any
parasol
or
any
shade
to
her
hat
stopping
for
nothing
and
crossing
the
churchyard
at
weston
with
as
much
expedition
as
if
we
were
afraid
of
being
buried
alive
after
seeing
what
she
is
equal
to
i
can
not
help
feeling
a
regard
for
her
as
to
agreeableness
she
is
much
like
other
people
i
went
with
my
mother
to
help
look
at
some
houses
in
new
king
street
towards
which
she
felt
some
kind
of
inclination
but
their
size
has
now
satisfied
her
they
were
smaller
than
i
expected
to
find
them
one
in
particular
out
of
the
two
was
quite
monstrously
little
the
best
of
the
not
so
large
as
the
little
parlour
at
steventon
and
the
second
room
in
every
floor
about
capacious
enough
to
admit
a
very
small
single
bed
you
will
be
sorry
to
hear
that
marianne
disorder
has
ended
fatally
she
was
believed
out
of
danger
on
sunday
but
a
sudden
relapse
carried
her
off
the
next
day
so
affectionate
a
family
must
suffer
severely
and
many
a
girl
on
early
death
has
been
praised
into
an
angel
i
believe
on
slighter
pretensions
to
beauty
sense
and
merit
than
marianne
paragon
tuesday
may
the
came
into
portsmouth
on
sunday
and
i
have
sent
charles
a
short
letter
by
this
post
my
adventures
since
i
wrote
you
three
days
ago
have
been
such
as
the
time
would
easily
contain
i
walked
yesterday
morning
with
chamberlayne
to
lyncombe
and
widcombe
and
in
the
evening
i
drank
tea
with
the
holders
chamberlayne
pace
was
not
quite
so
magnificent
on
this
second
trial
as
on
the
first
it
was
nothing
more
than
i
could
keep
up
with
without
effort
and
for
many
many
yards
together
on
a
raised
narrow
footpath
i
led
the
way
the
walk
was
very
beautiful
as
my
companion
agreed
whenever
i
made
the
observation
and
so
ends

friendship

the
chamberlaynes

a
day
or
two

likewise
for
the
loss
of

fust
as
you
will
lose
before
you
find
her
my
evening
visit
was
by
no
means
disagreeable
lillingston
came
to
engage
holder
conversation
and
miss
holder
and
i
adjourned
after
tea
to
the
inner
to
look
over
prints
and
talk
pathetically
she
is
very
unreserved
and
very
fond
of
talking
of
her
deceased
brother
and
sister
whose
memories
she
cherishes
with
an
enthusiasm
which
though
perhaps
a
little
affected
is
not
unpleasing
she
has
an
idea
of
your
being
remarkably
lively
therefore
get
ready
the
proper
selection
of
adverbs
and
due
scraps
of
italian
and
french
i
must
now
pause
to
make
some
observation
on
heathcote
having
got
a
little
boy
i
wish
her
well
to
wear
it
out
and
shall
proceed

will
detain
him
a
few
days
behind
my
father
in
town
i
have
seen
the
miss
mapletons
this
morning
marianne
was
buried
yesterday
and
i
called
without
expecting
to
be
let
in
to
enquire
after
them
all
on
the
servant
invitation
however
i
sent
in
my
name
and
jane
and
christiana
who
were
walking
in
the
garden
came
to
me
immediately
and
i
sat
with
them
about
ten
minutes
they
looked
pale
and
dejected
but
were
more
composed
than
i
had
thought
probable
when
i
mentioned
your
coming
here
on
monday
they
said
they
should
be
very
glad
to
see
you
we
drink
tea
with
lysons
now
this
says
my
master
will
be
mighty
dull
i
assure
you
in
spite
of
what
i
might
choose
to
insinuate
in
a
former
letter
that
i
have
seen
very
little
of
evelyn
since
my
coming
here
i
met
him
this
morning
for
only
the
fourth
time
and
as
to
my
anecdote
about
sydney
gardens
i
made
the
most
of
the
story
because
it
came
into
advantage
but
in
fact
he
only
asked
me
whether
i
were
to
be
in
sydney
gardens
in
the
evening
or
not
there
is
now
something
like
an
engagement
between
us
and
the
phaeton
which
to
confess
my
frailty
i
have
a
great
desire
to
go
out
in
but
whether
it
will
come
to
anything
must
remain
with
him
i
really
believe
he
is
very
harmless
people
do
not
seem
afraid
of
him
here
and
he
gets
groundsel
for
his
birds
and
all
that
yours
affectionately
j
a
i
am
just
returned
from
my
airing
in
the
very
bewitching
phaeton
and
four
for
which
i
was
prepared
by
a
note
from
soon
after
breakfast
we
went
to
the
top
of
kingsdown
and
had
a
very
pleasant
drive
one
pleasure
succeeds
another
rapidly
on
my
return
i
found
your
letter
and
a
letter
from
charles
on
the
table
the
contents
of
yours
i
suppose
i
need
not
repeat
to
you
to
thank
you
for
it
will
be
enough
i
give
charles
great
credit
for
remembering
my
direction
and
he
seems
rather
surprised
at
it
himself
he
has
received
for
his
share
of
the
privateer
and
expects
more
but
of
what
avail
is
it
to
take
prizes
if
he
lays
out
the
produce
in
presents
to
his
sisters
he
has
been
buying
gold
chains
and
topaze
crosses
for
us
he
must
be
well
scolded
the
has
already
received
orders
for
taking
troops
to
egypt
which
i
should
not
like
at
all
if
i
did
not
trust
to
charles
being
removed
from
her
somehow
or
other
before
she
sails
he
knows
nothing
of
his
own
destination
he
says
but
desires
me
to
write
directly
as
the
will
probably
sail
in
three
or
four
days
he
will
receive
my
yesterday
letter
and
i
shall
write
again
by
this
post
to
thank
and
reproach
him
we
shall
be
unbearably
fine
so
began
the
five
years
residence
at
bath
cassandra
and
her
father
the
latter
having
been
paying
visits
in
kent
and
london
joined
the
others
at
the
beginning
of
june
and
from
that
date
till
september
there
is
little
that
can
be
said
definitely
about
jane
life
we
know
however
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
austens
to
spend
the
summer
of
by
the
sea
perhaps
at
sidmouth
and
a
letter
of
eliza
austen
informs
us
that
this
plan
was
duly
carried
out
she
writes
to
phila
walter
on
october
i
conclude
that
you
know
of
our
uncle
and
aunt
austen
and
their
daughters
having
spent
the
summer
in
devonshire
they
are
now
returned
to
bath
where
they
are
superintending
the
fitting
up
of
their
new
house
so
the
house
had
at
last
been
fixed
on
and
we
learn
in
the
that
it
was
no
sydney
terrace
in
the
parish
of
bathwick
the
houses
here
face
the
sydney
gardens
and
it
is
a
part
of
bath
that
jane
seems
to
have
fancied
her
residence
there
is
now
commemorated
by
a
marble
tablet
how
long
the
austens
resided
in
this
house
can
not
definitely
be
stated
perhaps
they
took
it
for
three
years
at
any
rate
by
the
beginning
of
they
had
moved
to
green
park
buildings
possibly
austen
as
he
grew
older
had
found
the
distance
to
the
centre
of
the
town
too
great
for
his
powers
of
walking
one
of
the
few
facts
we
know
concerning
their
stay
in
sydney
place
is
that
at
one
time
austen
was
extremely
ill
but
the
skill
of
her
medical
adviser
a
certain
bowen
and
the
affectionate
care
of
her
daughters
pulled
her
through
and
enabled
her
to
live
for
another
years
austen
has
recorded
the
fact
of
her
illness
in
some
humorous
verses
entitled
between
death
and
mrs
a
says
death
been
trying
these
three
weeks
and
more
to
seize
on
old
madam
here
at
number
four
yet
i
still
try
in
vain
tho
she
turned
of
three
score
to
what
is
my
owing
tell
you
old
fellow
if
you
can
not
guess
to
what
you
indebted
for
your
ill
success
to
the
prayers
of
my
husband
whose
love
i
possess
to
the
care
of
my
daughters
whom
heaven
will
bless
to
the
skill
and
attention
of
bowen
in
in
addition
to
the
visit
to
steventon
with
its
distressing
incidents
jane
was
at
dawlish
for
in
a
letter
written
in
she
says
of
the
library
at
dawlish
that
it
pitiful
and
wretched
twelve
years
ago
and
not
likely
to
have
anybody
publications
a
writer
too
in
for
february
states
that
about
this
time
the
austens
went
to
teignmouth
which
would
be
very
easily
combined
with
a
stay
at
dawlish
and
that
they
resided
there
some
weeks
this
was
the
year
of
the
short
cessation
of
hostilities
brought
about
by
the
peace
of
amiens
during
its
continuance
we
are
told
that
the
henry
austens
went
to
france
in
the
vain
hope
of
recovering
some
of
her
first
husband
property
and
narrowly
escaped
being
included
amongst
the
had
been
given
by
bonaparte
government
to
detain
all
english
travellers
but
at
the
henry
austen
gave
the
necessary
orders
herself
and
her
french
was
so
perfect
that
she
passed
everywhere
for
a
native
and
her
husband
escaped
under
this
protection
our
only
evidence
of
jane
having
been
absent
from
bath
in
is
that
sir
egerton
brydges
in
speaking
of
her
says
last
time
i
think
that
i
saw
her
was
at
ramsgate
in
on
francis
austen
promotion
already
mentioned
admiral
gambier
seems
rather
to
have
gone
out
of
his
way
to
choose
him
as
his
on
the
but
on
the
peace
of
amiens
he
like
many
others
went
on
his
first
employment
when
war
broke
out
again
in
was
the
raising
from
among
the
kent
fishermen
of
a
corps
of
fencibles
to
protect
the
coast
from
invasion
his
were
at
ramsgate
and
it
was
quite
likely
that
jane
would
visit
him
there
especially
if
she
could
combine
this
visit
with
one
to
godmersham
we
shall
see
later
that
the
fencibles
did
not
take
up
the
whole
of
frank
time
she
must
now
have
begun
to
turn
her
mind
again
to
her
neglected
and
especially
to
this
no
doubt
underwent
a
thorough
revision
mentioned
in
the
famous
dissertation
on
novels
was
not
published
till
and
there
is
evidence
that
she
sold
the
under
the
title
of
in
the
spring
of
not
indeed
to
a
bath
publisher
as
has
been
often
stated
but
to
crosby
son
of
london
for
ten
pounds
stipulating
for
an
early
publication
distrustful
of
appearing
under
her
own
name
in
the
transaction
jane
seems
to
have
employed
a
certain
seymour
probably
her
brother
henry
man
of
business
a
fact
which
suggests
that
the
sale
was
effected
while
jane
was
staying
in
london
with
henry
for
reasons
best
known
to
himself
crosby
did
not
proceed
with
the
publication
besides
jane
seems
to
have
written
at
this
time
the
beginning
of
a
tale
which
was
published
in
the
second
edition
of
the
memoir
as
although
the
author
had
not
given
that
or
any
other
name
to
it
the
setting
of
the
story
was
very
like
that
of
the
novels
with
which
we
are
so
familiar
and
the
characters
were
sketched
in
with
a
firm
hand
one
of
these
creations
in
particular
might
have
been
expected
to
in
another
book
if
this
work
was
to
be
laid
aside
but
such
a
procedure
was
contrary
to
jane
invariable
practice
it
is
the
character
of
a
young
man
tom
musgrave
by
name
a
clever
and
toady
with
rather
more
attractive
qualities
than
usually
fall
to
the
lot
of
the
members
of
that
fraternity
but
why
was
it
laid
aside
the
writer
of
the
suggests
that
the
author
may
have
become
aware
the
evil
of
having
placed
her
heroine
too
low
in
a
position
of
poverty
and
obscurity
which
though
not
necessarily
connected
with
vulgarity
has
a
sad
tendency
to
degenerate
into
it
and
therefore
like
a
singer
who
has
begun
on
too
low
a
note
she
discontinued
the
strain
to
this
we
may
add
that
circumstances
soon
occurred
to
divert
her
mind
from
original
composition
for
a
considerable
period
and
when
at
last
she
returned
to
it
she
was
much
more
likely
to
think
of
the
two
completed
stories
that
were
lying
in
her
desk
than
of
one
that
was
only
begun
she
did
however
retain
in
her
recollection
the
outline
of
the
intended
story
the
of
still
existing
is
written
on
the
small
sheets
of
paper
described
in
the
sheets
which
could
be
easily
covered
with
a
piece
of
in
case
of
the
arrival
of
unexpected
visitors
and
which
would
thus
fit
in
with
her
desire
for
secrecy
all
the
pages
are
written
in
her
beautifully
neat
handwriting
but
some
seem
to
flow
on
without
doubt
or
difficulty
while
others
are
subject
to
copious
corrections
as
all
the
mss
of
her
six
published
novels
have
perished
it
is
worth
our
while
to
notice
her
methods
where
we
can
the
first
interruption
that
occurred
to
her
writing
in
was
of
a
pleasant
nature
and
none
of
her
admirers
need
regret
it
she
went
to
lyme
with
her
family
they
had
been
joined
in
their
summer
rambles
by
the
henry
austens
who
afterwards
proceeded
with
cassandra
to
weymouth
leaving
jane
with
her
parents
at
lyme
we
have
it
on
record
that
jane
loved
the
sight
of
the
beauties
of
nature
so
much
that
she
would
sometimes
say
she
thought
it
must
form
one
of
the
joys
of
heaven
but
she
had
few
opportunities
of
visiting
any
scenes
of
especial
beauty
we
need
not
therefore
be
surprised
that
the
impression
produced
by
lyme
was
so
great
that
she
retained
a
vivid
and
accurate
memory
of
the
details
eleven
years
afterwards
in
she
allowed
herself
to
dwell
on
them
with
greater
fullness
and
greater
enthusiasm
than
she
had
ever
displayed
on
similar
occasions
before
readers
of
that
book
who
visit
lyme
especially
if
they
have
the
valuable
help
of
the
miss
descriptions
and
sketches
will
feel
no
difficulty
in
recognising
the
exact
spot
on
the
cobb
which
was
pointed
out
to
tennyson
as
the
scene
of
the
fall
of
louisa
musgrove
or
the
but
minute
house
at
the
corner
of
the
pier
past
which
captain
benwick
was
seen
rushing
for
the
doctor
and
in
which
the
harvilles
managed
to
entertain
a
large
party
they
may
note
the
point
on
the
steps
leading
down
to
the
sea
where
elliot
first
saw
anne
and
if
they
go
to
the
lion
hotel
and
engage
a
private
they
can
look
from
the
window
as
mary
musgrove
looked
at
her
cousin
carriage
when
she
recognised
the
elliot
countenance
but
failed
to
see
the
elliot
arms
because
the
was
folded
over
the
panels
the
letter
which
follows
was
written
when
cassandra
was
just
leaving
weymouth
to
go
to
ibthorp
where
old
lloyd
lay
very
lyme
friday
september
my
dear
cassandra
i
take
the
first
sheet
of
fine
striped
paper
to
thank
you
for
your
letter
from
weymouth
and
express
my
hopes
of
your
being
at
ibthorp
before
this
time
i
expect
to
hear
that
you
reached
it
yesterday
evening
being
able
to
get
as
far
as
blandford
on
wednesday
your
account
of
weymouth
contains
nothing
which
strikes
me
so
forcibly
as
there
being
no
ice
in
the
town
for
every
other
vexation
i
was
in
some
measure
prepared
and
particularly
for
your
disappointment
in
not
seeing
the
royal
family
go
on
board
on
tuesday
having
already
heard
from
crawford
that
he
had
seen
you
in
the
very
act
of
being
too
late
but
for
there
being
no
ice
what
could
prepare
me
you
found
my
letter
at
andover
i
hope
yesterday
and
have
now
for
many
hours
been
satisfied
that
your
kind
anxiety
on
my
behalf
was
as
much
thrown
away
as
kind
anxiety
usually
is
i
continue
quite
well
in
proof
of
which
i
have
bathed
again
this
morning
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
have
the
little
fever
and
indisposition
which
i
had
it
has
been
all
the
fashion
this
week
in
lyme
we
are
quite
settled
in
our
lodgings
by
this
time
as
you
may
suppose
and
everything
goes
on
in
the
usual
order
the
servants
behave
very
well
and
make
no
difficulties
though
nothing
certainly
can
exceed
the
inconvenience
of
the
offices
except
the
general
dirtiness
of
the
house
and
furniture
and
all
its
inhabitants
i
endeavour
as
far
as
i
can
to
supply
your
place
and
be
useful
and
keep
things
in
order
i
detect
dirt
in
the
water
decanters
as
fast
as
i
can
and
keep
everything
as
it
was
under
your
administration
james
is
the
delight
of
our
lives
he
is
quite
an
uncle
toby
annuity
to
us
my
mother
shoes
were
never
so
well
blacked
before
and
our
plate
never
looked
so
clean
he
waits
extremely
well
is
attentive
handy
quick
and
quiet
and
in
short
has
a
great
many
more
than
all
the
cardinal
virtues
for
the
cardinal
virtues
in
themselves
have
been
so
often
possessed
that
they
are
no
longer
worth
having
and
amongst
the
rest
that
of
wishing
to
go
to
bath
as
i
understand
from
jenny
he
has
the
laudable
thirst
i
fancy
for
travelling
which
in
poor
james
selby
was
so
much
reprobated
and
part
of
his
disappointment
in
not
going
with
his
master
arose
from
his
wish
of
seeing
london
the
ball
last
night
was
pleasant
but
not
full
for
thursday
my
father
staid
very
contentedly
till
nine
we
went
a
little
after
eight
and
then
walked
home
with
james
and
a
lanthorn
though
i
believe
the
lanthorn
was
not
lit
as
the
moon
was
up
but
this
lanthorn
may
sometimes
be
a
great
convenience
to
him
my
mother
and
i
staid
about
an
hour
later
nobody
asked
me
the
two
first
dances
the
two
next
i
danced
with
crawford
and
had
i
chosen
to
stay
longer
might
have
danced
with
granville
granville
son
whom
my
dear
friend
miss
offered
to
introduce
to
me
or
with
a
new
man
who
had
been
eyeing
me
for
some
time
and
at
last
without
any
introduction
asked
me
if
i
meant
to
dance
again
i
think
he
must
be
irish
by
his
ease
and
because
i
imagine
him
to
belong
to
the
ble
b
who
are
the
son
and
son
wife
of
an
irish
viscount
bold
people
just
fit
to
be
quality
at
lyme
i
called
yesterday
morning
ought
it
not
in
strict
propriety
to
be
termed
on
miss
and
was
introduced
to
her
father
and
mother
like
other
young
ladies
she
is
considerably
genteeler
than
her
parents
sat
darning
a
pair
of
stockings
the
whole
of
my
visit
but
do
not
mention
this
at
home
lest
a
warning
should
act
as
an
example
we
afterwards
walked
together
for
an
hour
on
the
cobb
she
is
very
converseable
in
a
common
way
i
do
not
perceive
wit
or
genius
but
she
has
sense
and
some
degree
of
taste
and
her
manners
are
very
engaging
she
seems
to
like
people
rather
too
easily
she
thought
the
pleasant
the
bathing
was
so
delightful
this
morning
and
molly
so
pressing
with
me
to
enjoy
myself
that
i
believe
i
staid
in
rather
too
long
as
since
the
middle
of
the
day
i
have
felt
unreasonably
tired
i
shall
be
more
careful
another
time
and
shall
not
bathe
as
i
had
before
intended
jenny
and
james
are
walked
to
charmouth
this
afternoon
i
am
glad
to
have
such
an
amusement
for
him
as
i
am
very
anxious
for
his
being
at
once
quiet
and
happy
he
can
read
and
i
must
get
him
some
books
unfortunately
he
has
read
the
first
vol
of
we
have
the
pinckards
newspaper
however
which
i
shall
take
care
to
lend
him
as
the
autumn
of
was
succeeded
by
winter
jane
thoughts
were
to
be
taken
up
by
more
serious
considerations
on
her
birthday
december
occurred
the
death
by
a
fall
from
her
horse
of
her
great
friend
lefroy
on
which
we
have
already
dwelt
but
she
was
shortly
to
suffer
an
even
greater
loss
for
on
january
her
father
died
after
an
illness
of
only
hours
jane
letter
or
rather
two
letters
for
the
first
being
wrongly
directed
she
had
to
write
a
second
to
her
brother
frank
on
this
occasion
have
fortunately
been
kept
green
park
buildings
tuesday
evening
january
my
dearest
frank
i
wrote
to
you
yesterday
but
your
letter
to
cassandra
this
morning
by
which
we
learn
the
probability
of
your
being
by
this
time
at
portsmouth
obliges
me
to
write
to
you
again
having
unfortunately
a
communication
as
necessary
as
painful
to
make
to
you
your
affectionate
heart
will
be
greatly
wounded
and
i
wish
the
shock
could
have
been
lessened
by
a
better
preparation
but
the
event
has
been
sudden
and
so
must
be
the
information
of
it
we
have
lost
an
excellent
father
an
illness
of
only
eight
and
forty
hours
carried
him
off
yesterday
morning
between
ten
and
eleven
he
was
seized
on
saturday
with
a
return
of
the
feverish
complaint
which
he
had
been
subject
to
for
the
last
three
years
a
physician
was
called
in
yesterday
morning
but
he
was
at
that
time
past
all
possibility
of
cure
and
gibbs
and
bowen
had
scarcely
left
his
room
before
he
sunk
into
a
sleep
from
which
he
never
woke
it
has
been
very
sudden
within
hours
of
his
death
he
was
walking
about
with
only
the
help
of
a
stick
was
even
reading
we
had
however
some
hours
of
preparation
and
when
we
understood
his
recovery
to
be
hopeless
most
fervently
did
we
pray
for
the
speedy
release
which
ensued
to
have
seen
him
languishing
long
struggling
for
hours
would
have
been
dreadful
and
thank
god
we
were
all
spared
from
it
except
the
restlessness
and
confusion
of
high
fever
he
did
not
suffer
and
he
was
mercifully
spared
from
knowing
that
he
was
about
to
quit
objects
so
beloved
and
so
fondly
cherished
as
his
wife
and
children
ever
were
his
tenderness
as
a
father
who
can
do
justice
to
the
funeral
is
to
be
on
saturday
at
walcot
church
the
serenity
of
the
corpse
is
most
delightful
it
preserves
the
sweet
benevolent
smile
which
always
distinguished
him
they
kindly
press
my
mother
to
remove
to
steventon
as
soon
as
it
is
all
over
but
i
do
not
believe
she
will
leave
bath
at
present
we
must
have
this
house
for
three
months
longer
and
here
we
shall
probably
stay
till
the
end
of
that
time
we
all
unite
in
love
and
i
am
affectionately
yours
j
a
the
companion
letter
sent
to
a
different
address
gives
a
similar
account
and
contains
also
these
words
heavy
as
is
the
blow
we
can
already
feel
that
a
thousand
comforts
remain
to
us
to
soften
it
next
to
that
of
the
consciousness
of
his
worth
and
constant
preparation
for
another
world
is
the
remembrance
of
his
having
suffered
comparatively
speaking
nothing
being
quite
insensible
of
his
own
state
he
was
spared
all
pain
of
separation
and
he
went
off
almost
in
his
sleep
my
mother
bears
the
shock
as
well
as
possible
she
was
quite
prepared
for
it
and
feels
all
the
blessing
of
his
being
spared
a
long
illness
my
uncle
and
aunt
have
been
with
us
and
show
us
every
imaginable
kindness
adieu
my
dearest
frank
the
loss
of
such
a
parent
must
be
felt
or
we
should
be
brutes
i
wish
i
could
give
you
a
better
preparation
but
it
has
been
impossible
yours
ever
affectionately
j
austen
death
placed
his
widow
and
daughters
in
straitened
circumstances
for
most
of
his
income
had
been
derived
from
the
livings
of
steventon
and
deane
in
fact
the
income
of
austen
together
with
that
of
cassandra
who
had
inherited
one
thousand
pounds
from
her
intended
husband
thomas
fowle
was
no
more
than
two
hundred
and
ten
pounds
fortunately
she
had
sons
who
were
only
too
glad
to
be
able
to
help
her
and
her
income
was
raised
to
four
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
a
year
by
contributions
of
one
hundred
pounds
from
edward
and
fifty
pounds
from
james
henry
and
frank
respectively
frank
indeed
was
ready
to
do
more
for
henry
wrote
to
him
to
say
that
their
mother
the
magnificence
of
your
offer
and
accepts
of
half
austen
first
idea
was
to
remain
in
bath
so
long
as
her
brother
leigh
perrot
lived
there
accordingly
she
gave
up
her
house
at
lady
day
and
moved
with
her
daughters
and
one
maid
into
furnished
lodgings
at
gay
street
early
in
april
cassandra
was
staying
at
ibthorp
where
it
was
her
lot
to
attend
another
that
of
old
lloyd
gay
street
monday
april
my
dear
cassandra
here
is
a
day
for
you
did
bath
or
ibthorp
ever
see
a
finer
of
april
it
is
march
and
april
together
the
glare
of
one
and
the
warmth
of
the
other
we
do
nothing
but
walk
about
as
far
as
your
means
will
admit
i
hope
you
profit
by
such
weather
too
i
dare
say
you
are
already
the
better
for
change
of
place
we
were
out
again
last
night
miss
irvine
invited
us
when
i
met
her
in
the
crescent
to
drink
tea
with
them
but
i
rather
declined
it
having
no
idea
that
my
mother
would
be
disposed
for
another
evening
visit
there
so
soon
but
when
i
gave
her
the
message
i
found
her
very
well
inclined
to
go
and
accordingly
on
leaving
chapel
we
walked
to
lansdown
this
morning
we
have
been
to
see
miss
chamberlayne
look
hot
on
horseback
seven
years
and
four
months
ago
we
went
to
the
same
to
see
miss
lefroy
performance
what
a
different
set
are
we
now
moving
in
but
seven
years
i
suppose
are
enough
to
change
every
pore
of
one
skin
and
every
feeling
of
mind
we
did
not
walk
long
in
the
crescent
yesterday
it
was
hot
and
not
crowded
enough
so
we
went
into
the
field
and
passed
close
by
and
miss
again
i
have
not
yet
seen
her
face
but
neither
her
dress
nor
air
have
anything
of
the
dash
or
stylishness
which
the
browns
talked
of
quite
the
contrary
indeed
her
dress
is
not
even
smart
and
her
appearance
very
quiet
miss
irvine
says
she
is
never
speaking
a
word
poor
wretch
i
am
afraid
she
is
here
has
been
that
excellent
coulthart
calling
while
my
mother
was
out
and
i
was
believed
to
be
so
i
always
respected
her
as
a
friendly
woman
and
the
brownes
have
been
here
i
find
their
affidavits
on
the
table
the
reached
gibraltar
on
the
of
march
and
found
all
well
so
say
the
papers
we
have
had
no
letters
from
anybody
but
we
expect
to
hear
from
edward
and
from
you
soon
afterwards
how
happy
they
are
at
godmersham
now
i
shall
be
very
glad
of
a
letter
from
ibthorp
that
i
may
know
how
you
all
are
but
particularly
yourself
this
is
nice
weather
for
austen
going
to
speen
and
i
hope
she
will
have
a
pleasant
visit
there
i
expect
a
prodigious
account
of
the
christening
dinner
perhaps
it
brought
you
at
last
into
the
company
of
miss
dundas
again
i
received
your
letter
last
night
and
wish
it
may
be
soon
followed
by
another
to
say
that
all
is
over
but
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
nature
will
struggle
again
and
produce
a
revival
poor
woman
may
her
end
be
peaceful
and
easy
as
the
exit
we
have
witnessed
and
i
dare
say
it
will
if
there
is
no
revival
suffering
must
be
all
over
even
the
consciousness
of
existence
i
suppose
was
gone
when
you
wrote
the
nonsense
i
have
been
writing
in
this
and
in
my
last
letter
seems
out
of
place
at
such
a
time
but
i
will
not
mind
it
it
will
do
you
no
harm
and
nobody
else
will
be
attacked
by
it
i
am
heartily
glad
that
you
can
speak
so
comfortably
of
your
own
health
and
looks
though
i
can
scarcely
comprehend
the
latter
being
really
approved
could
travelling
fifty
miles
produce
such
an
immediate
change
you
were
looking
very
poorly
here
and
everybody
seemed
sensible
of
it
is
there
a
charm
in
a
hack
but
if
there
were
carriage
might
have
undone
it
all
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
time
and
trouble
you
have
bestowed
on
mary
cap
and
am
glad
it
pleases
her
but
it
will
prove
a
useless
gift
at
present
i
suppose
will
not
she
leave
ibthorp
on
her
mother
death
as
a
companion
you
are
all
that
martha
can
be
supposed
to
want
and
in
that
light
under
these
circumstances
your
visit
will
indeed
have
been
well
timed
the
cookes
want
us
to
drink
tea
with
them
but
i
do
not
know
whether
my
mother
will
have
nerves
for
it
we
are
engaged
evening
what
request
we
are
in
chamberlayne
expressed
to
her
niece
her
wish
of
being
intimate
enough
with
us
to
ask
us
to
drink
tea
with
her
in
a
quiet
way
we
have
therefore
offered
her
ourselves
and
our
quietness
through
the
same
medium
our
tea
and
sugar
will
last
a
great
while
i
think
we
are
just
the
kind
of
people
and
party
to
be
treated
about
among
our
relations
we
can
not
be
supposed
to
be
very
rich
i
was
not
able
to
go
on
yesterday
all
my
wit
and
leisure
were
bestowed
on
letters
to
charles
and
henry
to
the
former
i
wrote
in
consequence
of
my
mother
having
seen
in
the
papers
that
the
was
waiting
at
portsmouth
for
the
convoy
for
halifax
this
is
nice
as
it
is
only
three
weeks
ago
that
you
wrote
by
the
i
wrote
to
henry
because
i
had
a
letter
from
him
in
which
he
desired
to
hear
from
me
very
soon
his
to
me
was
most
affectionate
and
kind
as
well
as
entertaining
there
is
no
merit
to
him
in
he
can
not
help
being
amusing
he
offers
to
meet
us
on
the
sea
coast
if
the
plan
of
which
edward
gave
him
some
hint
takes
place
will
not
this
be
making
the
execution
of
such
a
plan
more
desirable
and
delightful
than
ever
he
talks
of
the
rambles
we
took
together
last
summer
with
pleasing
affection
yours
ever
j
a
the
same
to
the
gay
street
sunday
evening
april
my
dear
cassandra
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
writing
to
me
again
so
soon
your
letter
yesterday
was
quite
an
unexpected
pleasure
poor
stent
it
has
been
her
lot
to
be
always
in
the
way
but
we
must
be
merciful
for
perhaps
in
time
we
may
come
to
be
stents
ourselves
unequal
to
anything
and
unwelcome
to
everybody
your
account
of
martha
is
very
comfortable
indeed
and
now
we
shall
be
in
no
fear
of
receiving
a
worse
this
day
if
she
has
gone
to
church
must
have
been
a
trial
to
her
feelings
but
it
will
be
the
last
of
any
acuteness
yesterday
was
a
busy
day
with
me
i
went
to
sydney
gardens
soon
after
one
and
did
not
return
until
four
and
after
dinner
i
walked
to
weston
my
morning
engagement
was
with
the
cookes
and
our
party
consisted
of
george
and
mary
a
and
miss
who
had
been
with
us
at
the
concert
and
the
youngest
miss
not
julia
we
have
done
with
her
she
is
very
ill
but
mary
mary
turn
is
actually
come
to
be
grown
up
and
have
a
fine
complexion
and
wear
a
great
square
muslin
shawl
i
have
not
expressly
enumerated
myself
among
the
party
but
there
i
was
and
my
cousin
george
was
very
kind
and
talked
sense
to
me
every
now
and
then
in
the
intervals
of
his
more
animated
fooling
with
miss
who
is
very
young
and
rather
handsome
and
whose
gracious
manners
ready
wit
and
solid
remarks
put
me
somewhat
in
mind
of
my
old
acquaintance
there
was
a
monstrous
deal
of
stupid
quizzing
and
nonsense
talked
but
scarcely
any
wit
all
that
bordered
on
it
or
on
sense
came
from
my
cousin
george
whom
altogether
i
like
very
well
seems
nothing
more
than
a
tall
young
man
my
evening
engagement
and
walk
was
with
miss
who
had
called
on
me
the
day
before
and
gently
upbraided
me
in
her
turn
with
a
change
of
manners
to
her
since
she
had
been
in
bath
or
at
least
of
late
unlucky
me
that
my
notice
should
be
of
such
consequence
and
my
manners
so
bad
she
was
so
well
disposed
and
so
reasonable
that
i
soon
forgave
her
and
made
this
engagement
with
her
in
proof
of
it
she
is
really
an
agreeable
girl
so
i
think
i
may
like
her
and
her
great
want
of
a
companion
at
home
which
may
well
make
any
tolerable
acquaintance
important
to
her
gives
her
another
claim
on
my
attention
i
shall
as
much
as
possible
endeavour
to
keep
my
intimacies
in
their
proper
place
and
prevent
their
clashing
among
so
many
friends
it
will
be
well
if
i
do
not
get
into
a
scrape
and
now
here
is
miss
blachford
come
i
should
have
gone
distracted
if
the
bullers
had
staid
i
am
quite
of
your
opinion
as
to
the
folly
of
concealing
any
longer
our
intended
partnership
with
martha
and
wherever
there
has
of
late
been
an
enquiry
on
the
subject
i
have
always
been
sincere
and
i
have
sent
word
of
it
to
the
mediterranean
in
a
letter
to
frank
none
of
nearest
connections
i
think
will
be
unprepared
for
it
and
i
do
not
know
how
to
suppose
that
have
not
foreseen
it
when
i
tell
you
we
have
been
visiting
a
countess
this
morning
you
will
immediately
with
great
justice
but
no
truth
guess
it
to
be
lady
roden
no
it
is
lady
leven
the
mother
of
lord
balgonie
on
receiving
a
message
from
lord
and
lady
leven
through
the
mackays
declaring
their
intention
of
waiting
on
us
we
thought
it
right
to
go
to
them
i
hope
we
have
not
done
too
much
but
the
friends
and
admirers
of
charles
must
be
attended
to
they
seem
very
reasonable
good
sort
of
people
very
civil
and
full
of
his
praise
we
were
shewn
at
first
into
an
empty
and
presently
in
came
his
lordship
not
knowing
who
we
were
to
apologise
for
the
servant
mistake
and
tell
a
lie
himself
that
lady
leven
was
not
within
he
is
a
tall
man
with
spectacles
and
rather
deaf
after
sitting
with
him
ten
minutes
we
walked
away
but
lady
leven
coming
out
of
the
dining
parlour
as
we
passed
the
door
we
were
obliged
to
attend
her
back
to
it
and
pay
our
visit
over
again
she
is
a
stout
woman
with
a
very
handsome
face
by
this
means
we
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
charles
praises
twice
over
they
think
themselves
excessively
obliged
to
him
and
estimate
him
so
highly
as
to
wish
lord
balgonie
when
he
is
quite
recovered
to
go
out
to
him
there
is
a
pretty
little
lady
marianne
of
the
party
to
be
shaken
hands

that

we
have

letters
from

she
was
spending
her

seeing
a
good
deal
of

and
playing
with

my
dear
cassandra
george
is
a
fine
boy
and
well
behaved
but
daniel
chiefly
delighted
me
the
good
humour
of
his
countenance
is
quite
bewitching
after
tea
we
had
a
and
he
and
i
won
two
rubbers
of
his
brother
and
mary
brett
was
the
only
person
there
besides
our
two
families
yesterday
was
a
very
quiet
day
with
us
my
noisiest
efforts
were
writing
to
frank
and
playing
battledore
and
shuttlecock
with
william
he
and
i
have
practised
together
two
mornings
and
improve
a
little
we
have
frequently
kept
it
up
times
and
once
or
twice
the
two
edwards
went
to
canterbury
in
the
chaise
and
found
knight
as
you
found
her
i
suppose
the
day
before
cheerful
but
weak
i
have
been
used
very
ill
this
morning
i
have
received
a
letter
from
frank
which
i
ought
to
have
had
when
elizabeth
and
henry
had
theirs
and
which
in
its
way
from
albany
to
godmersham
has
been
to
dover
and
steventon
it
was
finished
on
the
and
tells
what
theirs
told
before
as
to
his
present
situation
he
is
in
a
great
hurry
to
be
married
and
i
have
encouraged
him
in
it
in
the
letter
which
ought
to
have
been
an
answer
to
his
he
must
think
it
very
strange
that
i
do
not
acknowledge
the
receipt
of
his
when
i
speak
of
those
of
the
same
date
to
eliz
and
henry
and
to
add
to
my
injuries
i
forgot
to
number
mine
on
the
outside
elizabeth
has
this
moment
proposed
a
scheme
which
will
be
very
much
for
my
pleasure
if
equally
convenient
to
the
other
party
it
is
that
when
you
return
on
monday
i
should
take
your
place
at
goodnestone
for
a
few
days
harriot
can
not
be
insincere
let
her
try
for
it
ever
so
much
and
therefore
i
defy
her
to
accept
this
of
mine
unless
it
be
really
what
perfectly
suits
her
as
there
is
no
time
for
an
answer
i
shall
go
in
the
carriage
on
monday
and
can
return
with
you
if
my
going
to
goodnestone
is
at
all
inconvenient
goodnestone
farm
tuesday
august
there
is
no
chance
of
tickets
for
the
bridgeses
as
no
gentlemen
but
of
the
garrison
are
invited
with
a
civil
note
to
be
fabricated
to
lady
and
an
answer
written
to
miss
you
will
easily
believe
that
we
could
not
begin
dinner
till
six
we
were
agreeably
surprised
by
edward
company
to
it
he
had
been
strange
to
tell
too
late
for
the
cricket
match
too
late
at
least
to
play
himself
and
not
being
asked
to
dine
with
the
players
came
home
it
is
impossible
to
do
justice
to
the
hospitality
of
his
attentions
towards
me
he
made
a
point
of
ordering
toasted
cheese
for
supper
entirely
on
my
account
goodnestone
farm
friday
august
next
week
seems
likely
to
be
an
unpleasant
one
to
this
family
on
the
matter
of
game
the
evil
intentions
of
the
guards
are
certain
and
the
gentlemen
of
the
neighbourhood
seem
unwilling
to
come
forward
in
any
decided
or
early
support
of
their
rights
edward
bridges
has
been
trying
to
rouse
their
spirits
but
without
success
hammond
under
the
influence
of
daughters
and
an
expected
ball
declares
he
will
do
nothing

affectionately
j
cassandra
and
jane
had
a
scheme
for
going
to
worthing
with
some
of
their
young
nephews
and
nieces
but
we
can
say
no
more
about
the
plan
for
the
letters
now
cease
until
january
as
for
the
events
of
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
austens
spent
the
first
part
of
that
year
in
bath
dividing
their
time
somewhat
uncomfortably
between
different
lodgings
meanwhile
francis
austen
had
been
helping
to
make
history
though
not
always
in
so
front
a
rank
as
he
would
have
desired
to
occupy
we
left
him
raising
the
fencibles
at
ramsgate
instructing
the
defenders
of
the
coast
and
considering
the
possibilities
of
a
landing
by
the
french
in
their
vessels
it
was
at
ramsgate
that
he
was
noted
as
officer
who
knelt
in
church
and
it
was
there
that
he
met
and
fell
in
love
with
his
future
wife
mary
gibson
she
became
in
time
one
of
the
best
loved
of
the
but
we
are
told
that
at
the
time
the
engagement
was
a
slight
shock
to
cassandra
and
jane
because
the
lady
chosen
was
martha
lloyd
as
they
had
hoped
she
might
be
immediate
marriage
was
out
of
the
question
and
in
may
frank
was
appointed
to
the
the
flagship
of
admiral
louis
who
at
this
time
held
a
command
in
the
squadron
blockading
napoleon
flotilla
frank
removal
from
the
to
the
brought
him
home
for
a
short
time
just
at
the
date
of
his
father
death
in
january
in
march
admiral
louis
hoisted
his
flag
in
the
and
soon
became
to
nelson
frank
as
his
took
part
in
the
chase
after
villeneuve
to
the
west
indies
and
back
thus
far
fortune
had
favoured
him
a
state
of
things
which
seemed
likely
to
continue
as
he
was
personally
known
to
nelson
and
had
reason
to
hope
that
he
would
soon
give
him
the
command
of
a
frigate
but
a
sad
reverse
was
in
store
for
him
september
was
spent
in
blockading
cadiz
and
after
nelson
arrival
from
england
in
the
on
september
the
was
ordered
to
supplies
at
gibraltar
after
this
followed
an
order
to
admiral
louis
to
give
protection
as
far
as
cartagena
to
a
convoy
proceeding
to
malta
shaking
themselves
free
from
this
duty
on
the
news
that
the
enemy
fleet
was
coming
out
of
cadiz
they
made
haste
to
join
the
main
fleet
in
spite
of
contrary
winds
and
with
the
dreadful
apprehension
of
being
too
late
for
the
imminent
battle
do
not
profess
he
writes
to
mary
gibson
like
fighting
for
its
own
sake
but
if
there
has
been
an
action
with
the
combined
fleets
i
shall
ever
consider
the
day
on
which
i
sailed
from
the
squadron
as
the
most
inauspicious
one
of
my
life
six
days
later
on
october
he
had
to
add
my
dearest
mary
all
my
fears
are
but
too
fully
justified
the
fleets
have
met
and
after
a
very
severe
contest
a
most
decisive
victory
has
been
gained
by
the
english
to
lose
all
share
in
the
glory
of
a
day
which
surpasses
all
that
ever
went
before
is
what
i
can
not
think
of
with
any
degree
of
patience
but
he
soon
turns
from
selfish
regrets
to
speak
of
the
death
of
nelson
and
adds
never
heard
of
his
equal
nor
do
i
expect
again
to
see
such
a
man
to
the
soundest
judgment
he
united
prompt
decision
and
speedy
execution
of
his
plans
and
he
possessed
in
a
superior
degree
the
happy
talent
of
making
every
class
of
persons
pleased
with
their
situation
and
eager
to
exert
themselves
in
forwarding
the
public
service
for
his
personal
disappointment
frank
was
to
a
certain
extent
consoled
by
taking
part
in
sir
john
duckworth
cruise
to
the
west
indies
and
in
the
victory
over
the
french
at
domingo
the
squadron
returning
home
with
three
prizes
to
receive
the
thanks
of
parliament
on
their
arrival
at
the
beginning
of
may
in
the
following
july
francis
austen
and
mary
gibson
were
married
meanwhile
the
long
residence
at
bath
of
his
mother
and
sisters
had
come
to
an
end
on
july
austen
her
two
daughters
and
martha
lloyd
left
bath
cassandra
and
jane
were
thoroughly
tired
of
the
place
so
says
jane
in
a
letter
written
two
years
afterwards
to
cassandra
reminding
her
of
their
happy
feelings
of
escape
the
immediate
destination
of
the
party
was
clifton
and
here
martha
lloyd
left
them
perhaps
for
harrogate
in
accordance
with
the
lines
quoted
above
the
austens
did
not
stay
long
at
clifton
and
by
the
end
of
the
month
were
at
adlestrop
rectory
on
a
visit
to
thomas
leigh
but
neither
did
this
prove
more
than
a
brief
for
on
august
they
set
out
in
somewhat
peculiar
circumstances
together
with
leigh
his
sister
miss
elizabeth
leigh
hill
agent
of
leigh
and
all
the
house
party
to
stay
at
stoneleigh
abbey
in
warwickshire
the
circumstances
were
as
follows
on
july
occurred
the
death
of
the
hon
mary
leigh
who
had
been
for
twenty
years
of
the
stoneleigh
estates
under
the
will
of
her
brother
the
last
lord
leigh
the
estates
now
passed
according
to
lord
leigh
will
unto
the
first
and
nearest
of
his
kindred
being
male
and
of
his
blood
and
name
that
should
be
alive
at
the
time
all
the
leighs
of
the
stoneleigh
branch
had
died
out
and
an
heir
had
to
be
sought
among
their
remote
cousins
the
adlestrop
leighs
in
ordinary
circumstances
the
heir
would
have
been
james
henry
leigh
who
was
the
head
of
this
branch
but
by
the
peculiar
wording
of
lord
leigh
will
all
those
of
an
older
generation
who
were
thus
first
and
nearest
of
his
blood
and
name
appeared
to
take
precedence
of
the
natural
heir
although
this
does
not
seem
to
have
been
the
intention
of
lord
leigh
the
leigh
was
the
rev
thomas
leigh
who
therefore
became
the
legal
owner
of
stoneleigh
but
as
it
was
thought
possible
that
there
might
be
other
claimants
leigh
solicitor
advised
his
taking
immediate
possession
and
accordingly
leigh
and
all
his
house
party
moved
from
adlestrop
to
stoneleigh
this
visit
and
the
whole
question
of
the
succession
to
stoneleigh
must
have
been
especially
interesting
to
jane
mother
for
it
seemed
likely
that
austen
own
brother
leigh
perrot
would
under
the
terms
of
the
will
have
a
life
interest
in
the
estate
after
thomas
leigh
if
he
survived
him
it
was
however
obviously
most
in
accordance
with
the
desire
of
the
testator
and
with
the
general
opinion
of
the
family
that
the
estate
should
go
according
to
the
usual
rules
of
succession
by
primogeniture
in
the
adlestrop
branch
and
as
all
the
parties
to
the
transaction
were
on
excellent
terms
with
each
other
and
as
they
believed
it
to
be
quite
doubtful
what
interpretation
a
court
of
law
would
put
upon
the
will
they
settled
the
matter
without
any
such
intervention
leigh
perrot
resigned
his
claim
to
the
estate
and
gained
instead
a
capital
sum
of
and
an
annuity
of
which
lasted
until
the
death
of
his
wife
in
this
is
no
doubt
the
agreement
with
adlestrop
mentioned
below
in
the
letter
of
february
and
it
must
one
would
think
have
been
considered
satisfactory
indeed
the
writer
speaks
of
the
negotiation
as
over
the
remaining
clause
in
it
which
ensured
to
the
leigh
perrots
two
bucks
two
does
and
the
game
off
one
manor
annually
was
less
successful
for
the
bucks
sometimes
arrived
in
such
a
condition
as
to
demand
immediate
burial
yet
it
can
hardly
have
been
this
which
made
jane
at
a
later
date
speak
of
the
compromise
we
should
rather
treat
this
expression
as
one
of
her
not
meant
to
be
taken
seriously
here
writes
austen
on
august
found
ourselves
on
tuesday
that
is
yesterday
eating
fish
venison
and
all
manner
of
good
things
in
a
large
and
noble
parlour
hung
round
with
family
portraits
austen
had
expected
to
find
stoneleigh
very
grand
but
the
magnificence
of
the
place
surpassed
her
expectations
after
describing
its
exterior
she
adds
at
nine
in
the
morning
we
say
our
prayers
in
a
handsome
chapel
of
which
the
pulpit
is
now
hung
in
black
then
follows
breakfast
consisting
of
chocolate
coffee
and
tea
plum
cake
pound
cake
hot
rolls
cold
rolls
bread
and
butter
and
dry
toast
for
me
the
house
steward
a
fine
large
man
orders
all
these
matters
leigh
and
hill
are
busy
a
great
part
of
the
morning
walk
a
good
deal
for
the
woods
are
impenetrable
to
the
sun
even
in
the
middle
of
an
august
day
i
do
not
fail
to
spend
some
part
of
every
day
in
the
kitchen
garden
where
the
quantity
of
small
fruit
exceeds
anything
you
can
form
an
idea
of
she
concludes
her
letter
by
saying
our
visit
has
been
a
most
pleasant
one
we
all
seem
in
good
humour
disposed
to
be
pleased
and
endeavouring
to
be
agreeable
and
i
hope
we
succeed
poor
lady
saye
and
sele
to
be
sure
is
rather
tormenting
though
sometimes
amusing
and
affords
jane
many
a
good
laugh
but
she
fatigues
me
sadly
on
the
whole
we
depart
we
have
seen
the
remains
of
kenilworth
which
afforded
us
much
entertainment
and
i
expect
still
more
from
the
sight
of
warwick
castle
which
we
are
going
to
see
from
stoneleigh
we
may
imagine
the
austens
to
have
gone
on
to
pay
a
promised
visit
to
edward
cooper
living
in
staffordshire
but
the
curtain
drops
on
them
once
more
and
is
not
raised
again
until
jane
is
writing
from
southampton
on
january
owing
to
the
gap
in
the
letters
we
have
no
means
of
knowing
why
the
austens
selected
southampton
as
a
home
nor
are
we
told
what
jane
herself
thought
of
the
place
at
any
rate
it
was
a
change
from
bath
and
she
preferred
it
to
canterbury
which
from
its
nearness
to
godmersham
would
have
been
another
very
suitable
place
of
residence
southampton
was
in
her
old
county
and
within
fairly
easy
reach
of
her
old
home
and
probably
one
reason
for
choosing
the
neighbourhood
of
a
naval
centre
was
that
it
enabled
them
to
join
forces
with
frank
austen
and
his
newly
married
wife
but
we
should
doubt
whether
jane
ever
felt
really
at
home
during
her
two
or
three
years
residence
there
or
took
much
to
the
society
of
the
place
no
doubt
the
partnership
with
the
frank
austens
and
with
martha
made
it
possible
for
the
party
to
command
better
quarters
and
to
live
in
greater
comfort
than
would
have
been
within
reach
of
the
slender
means
of
the
austens
by
themselves
and
when
jane
letters
begin
again
it
is
pretty
clear
that
the
party
though
still
in
lodgings
were
getting
ready
to
take
possession
in
march
of
their
house
in
castle
square
they
were
living
in
a
very
quiet
way
not
caring
to
add
to
their
acquaintance
more
than
was
necessary
cassandra
was
at
this
time
on
a
visit
to
godmersham
and
martha
lloyd
was
also
away
the
austens
were
near
enough
to
steventon
to
be
visited
occasionally
by
james
austen
and
his
wife
and
between
their
own
acquaintance
and
frank
friends
in
the
service
they
had
what
they
wanted
in
the
way
of
society
southampton
wednesday
january
of
your
visit
there
to
canterbury
i
must
now
speak
it
surprises
but
pleases
me
more
and
i
consider
it
as
a
very
just
and
honourable
distinction
of
you
and
not
less
to
the
credit
of
knight
i
have
no
doubt
of
your
spending
your
time
with
her
most
pleasantly
in
quiet
and
rational
conversation
and
am
so
far
from
thinking
her
expectations
of
you
will
be
deceived
that
my
only
fear
is
of
your
being
so
agreeable
so
much
to
her
taste
as
to
make
her
wish
to
keep
you
with
her
for
ever
if
that
should
be
the
case
we
must
remove
to
canterbury
which
i
should
not
like
so
well
as
southampton
did
not
do
we
were
disgusted
in
twenty
pages
as
independent
of
a
bad
translation
it
has
indelicacies
which
disgrace
a
pen
hitherto
so
pure
and
we
changed
it
for
female
which
now
makes
our
evening
amusement
to
me
a
very
high
one
as
i
find
the
work
quite
equal
to
what
i
remembered
it
our
acquaintance
increase
too
fast
he
frank
was
recognised
lately
by
admiral
bertie
and
a
few
days
since
arrived
the
admiral
and
his
daughter
catherine
to
wait
upon
us
there
was
nothing
to
like
or
dislike
in
either
to
the
berties
are
to
be
added
the
lances
with
whose
cards
we
have
been
endowed
and
whose
visit
frank
and
i
returned
yesterday
they
live
about
a
mile
and
from
s
outhampton
to
the
right
of
the
new
road
to
portsmouth
and
i
believe
their
house
is
one
of
those
which
are
to
be
seen
almost
anywhere
among
the
woods
on
the
other
side
of
the
itchen
it
is
a
handsome
building
stands
high
and
in
a
very
beautiful
situation
we
found
only
lance
at
home
and
whether
she
boasts
any
offspring
besides
a
grand
pianoforte
did
not
appear
she
was
civil
and
chatty
enough
and
offered
to
introduce
us
to
some
acquaintance
in
southampton
which
we
gratefully
declined
i
suppose
they
must
be
acting
by
the
orders
of
lance
of
netherton
in
this
civility
as
there
seems
no
other
reason
for
their
coming
near
us
southampton
february
our
garden
is
putting
in
order
by
a
man
who
bears
a
remarkably
good
character
has
a
very
fine
complexion
and
asks
something
less
than
the
first
the
shrubs
which
border
the
gravel
walk
he
says
are
only
sweetbriar
and
roses
and
the
latter
of
an
indifferent
sort
we
mean
to
get
a
few
of
the
better
kind
therefore
and
at
my
own
particular
desire
he
procures
us
some
syringas
i
could
not
do
without
a
syringa
for
the
sake
of
cowper
line
we
talk
also
of
a
laburnum
the
border
under
the
terrace
wall
is
clearing
away
to
receive
currants
and
gooseberry
bushes
and
a
spot
is
found
very
proper
for
raspberries
the
alterations
and
improvements
within
doors
too
advance
very
properly
and
the
offices
will
be
made
very
convenient
indeed
our
dressing
table
is
constructing
on
the
spot
out
of
a
large
kitchen
table
belonging
to
the
house
for
doing
which
we
have
the
permission
of
husket
lord
lansdown
painter
domestic
painter
i
should
call
him
for
he
lives
in
the
castle
domestic
chaplains
have
given
way
to
this
more
necessary
office
and
i
suppose
whenever
the
walls
want
no
touching
up
he
is
employed
about
my
face
the
morning
was
so
wet
that
i
was
afraid
we
should
not
be
able
to
see
our
little
visitor
but
frank
who
alone
could
go
to
church
called
for
her
after
service
and
she
is
now
talking
away
at
my
side
and
examining
the
treasures
of
my
drawers
very
happy
i
believe
not
at
all
shy
of
course
her
name
is
catherine
and
her
caroline
she
is
something
like
her
brother
and
as
short
for
her
age
but
not
so
what
is
become
of
all
the
shyness
in
the
world
moral
as
well
as
natural
diseases
disappear
in
the
progress
of
time
and
new
ones
take
their
place
shyness
and
the
sweating
sickness
have
given
way
to
confidence
and
paralytic
complaints
our
little
visitor
has
just
left
us
and
left
us
highly
pleased
with
her
she
is
a
nice
natural
affectionate
girl
with
all
the
ready
civility
which
one
sees
in
the
best
children
in
the
present
day
so
unlike
anything
that
i
was
myself
at
her
age
that
i
am
often
all
astonishment
and
shame
half
her
time
was
spent
at
spillikins
which
i
consider
as
a
very
valuable
part
of
our
household
furniture
and
as
not
the
least
important
benefaction
from
the
family
of
knight
to
that
of
austen
there
i
flatter
myself
i
have
constructed
you
a
smartish
letter
considering
my
want
of
materials
but
like
my
dear
johnson
i
believe
i
have
dealt
more
in
notions
than
facts
southampton
friday
february
we
have
at
last
heard
something
of
austen
will
it
is
believed
at
tunbridge
that
he
has
left
everything
after
the
death
of
his
widow
to
austen
third
son
john
and
as
the
said
john
was
the
only
one
of
the
family
who
attended
the
funeral
it
seems
likely
to
be
true
my
mother
has
heard
this
morning
from
paragon
my
aunt
talks
much
of
the
violent
colds
prevailing
in
bath
from
which
my
uncle
has
suffered
ever
since
their
return
and
she
has
herself
a
cough
much
worse
than
any
she
ever
had
before
subject
as
she
has
always
been
to
bad
ones
she
writes
in
good
humour
and
cheerful
spirits
however
the
negotiation
between
them
and
adlestrop
so
happily
over
indeed
what
can
have
power
to
vex
her
materially
i
have
received
your
letter
but
i
suppose
you
do
not
expect
me
to
be
gratified
by
its
contents
i
confess
myself
much
disappointed
by
this
repeated
delay
of
your
return
for
though
i
had
pretty
well
given
up
all
idea
of
your
being
with
us
before
our
removal
i
felt
sure
that
march
would
not
pass
quite
away
without
bringing
you
before
april
comes
of
course
something
else
will
occur
to
detain
you
but
as
are
happy
all
this
is
selfishness
of
which
here
is
enough
for
one
page
frank
going
into
kent
depends
of
course
upon
his
being
unemployed
but
as
the
first
lord
after
promising
lord
moira
that
captain
should
have
the
first
good
frigate
that
was
vacant
has
since
given
away
two
or
three
fine
ones
he
has
no
particular
reason
to
expect
an
appointment
now
however
has
scarcely
spoken
about
the
kentish
journey
i
have
my
information
chiefly
from
her
and
she
considers
her
own
going
thither
as
more
certain
if
he
should
be
at
sea
than
if
not
frank
has
got
a
very
bad
cough
for
an
austen
but
it
does
not
disable
him
from
making
very
nice
fringe
for
the
curtains
i
recommend
grant
letters
as
a
present
to
her
martha
what
they
are
about
and
how
many
volumes
they
form
i
do
not
know
having
never
heard
of
them
but
from
miss
irvine
who
speaks
of
them
as
a
new
and
work
and
as
one
which
has
pleased
her
highly
i
have
inquired
for
the
book
here
but
find
it
quite
unknown
we
are
reading
baretti
other
book
and
find
him
dreadfully
abusive
of
poor
sharpe
i
can
no
longer
take
his
part
against
you
as
i
did
nine
years
ago
our
knowledge
of
the
house
which
was
the
austens
home
at
southampton
for
two
years
and
of
its
surroundings
is
derived
from
the
personal
reminiscences
of
the
author
of
the
who
was
now
old
enough
to
visit
his
relatives
and
who
tells
us
that
at
this
time
he
began
to
know
and
was
the
same
thing
to
love
his
aunt
jane
lived
he
says
a
commodious
house
in
a
corner
of
castle
square
with
a
pleasant
garden
bounded
on
one
side
by
the
old
city
walls
the
top
of
this
wall
was
sufficiently
wide
to
afford
a
pleasant
walk
with
an
extensive
view
easily
accessible
to
ladies
by
steps
castle
square
itself
was
occupied
a
fantastic
edifice
too
large
for
the
space
in
which
it
stood
though
too
small
to
accord
well
with
its
castellated
style
erected
by
the
second
marquis
of
lansdowne
the
whole
of
this
building
disappeared
after
the
death
of
its
eccentric
owner
in
november
his
and
successor
in
the
peerage
the
statesman
became
in
after
life
an
ardent
admirer
of
jane
austen
novels
and
told
a
friend
that
of
the
circumstances
of
his
life
which
he
looked
back
upon
with
vexation
was
that
miss
austen
should
once
have
been
living
some
weeks
in
his
neighbourhood
without
his
knowing
it
had
he
known
it
however
he
would
have
had
no
reason
in
the
southampton
period
for
imagining
her
to
be
an
author
on
march
we
may
imagine
the
party
taking
possession
of
their
new
house
but
frank
can
have
seen
but
little
of
it
before
he
took
command
of
the
in
april
and
went
to
the
cape
of
good
hope
on
convoying
duty
he
was
back
by
june
on
cassandra
return
the
two
sisters
must
have
been
together
for
a
considerable
period
but
till
june
we
know
little
that
is
definite
about
them
except
that
in
september
together
with
their
mother
they
paid
a
visit
to
chawton
house
edward
austen
hampshire
residence
during
these
years
charles
austen
was
long
engaged
in
the
unpleasant
and
unprofitable
duty
of
enforcing
the
right
of
search
on
the
atlantic
seaboard
of
america
hardly
anything
is
said
in
the
extant
letters
of
his
marriage
to
fanny
palmer
daughter
of
the
of
bermuda
which
took
place
in
the
month
of
june
found
jane
staying
with
her
brother
henry
in
brompton
but
we
have
no
details
of
her
stay
beyond
the
fact
that
she
watched
some
of
her
acquaintance
going
to
court
on
the
birthday
on
june
she
left
london
with
her
brother
james
his
wife
and
two
children
on
a
visit
to
godmersham
godmersham
wednesday
june
my
dear
cassandra
where
shall
i
begin
which
of
all
my
important
nothings
shall
i
tell
you
first
at
half
after
seven
yesterday
morning
henry
saw
us
into
our
own
carriage
and
we
drove
away
from
the
bath
hotel
which
had
been
found
most
uncomfortable
quarters
very
dirty
very
noisy
and
very
james
began
his
journey
by
the
coach
at
five
our
first
eight
miles
were
hot
deptford
hill
brought
to
my
mind
our
hot
journey
into
kent
fourteen
years
ago
but
after
blackheath
we
suffered
nothing
and
as
the
day
advanced
it
grew
quite
cool
at
dartford
which
we
reached
within
the
two
hours
and
we
went
to
the
bull
the
same
inn
at
which
we
breakfasted
in
that
said
journey
and
on
the
present
occasion
had
about
the
same
bad
butter
at
ten
we
were
again
off
and
travelling
on
without
any
adventure
reached
sittingbourne
by
three
daniel
was
watching
for
us
at
the
door
of
the
and
i
was
acknowledged
very
kindly
by
and
marshall
to
the
latter
of
whom
i
devoted
my
conversation
while
mary
went
out
to
buy
some
gloves
a
few
minutes
of
course
did
for
sittingbourne
and
so
off
we
drove
drove
drove
and
by
six
were
at
godmersham
our
two
brothers
were
walking
before
the
house
as
we
approached
as
natural
as
life
fanny
and
lizzie
met
us
in
the
hall
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasant
joy
we
went
for
a
few
minutes
into
the
breakfast
parlour
and
then
proceeded
to
our
rooms
mary
has
the
hall
chamber
i
am
in
the
yellow
room
very
literally
for
i
am
writing
in
it
at
this
moment
it
seems
odd
to
me
to
have
such
a
great
place
all
to
myself
and
to
be
at
godmersham
without
you
is
also
odd
you
are
wished
for
i
assure
you
fanny
who
came
to
me
as
soon
as
she
had
seen
her
aunt
james
to
her
room
and
stayed
while
i
dressed
was
as
energetic
as
usual
in
her
longings
for
you
she
is
grown
both
in
height
and
size
since
last
year
but
not
immoderately
looks
very
well
and
seems
as
to
conduct
and
manner
just
what
she
was
and
what
one
could
wish
her
to
continue
elizabeth
who
was
dressing
when
we
arrived
came
to
me
for
a
minute
attended
by
marianne
charles
and
louisa
and
you
will
not
doubt
gave
me
a
very
affectionate
welcome
that
i
had
received
such
from
edward
also
i
need
not
mention
but
i
do
you
see
because
it
is
a
pleasure
i
never
saw
him
look
in
better
health
and
fanny
says
he
is
perfectly
well
i
can
not
praise
elizabeth
looks
but
they
are
probably
affected
by
a
cold
her
little
namesake
has
gained
in
beauty
in
the
last
three
years
though
not
all
that
marianne
has
lost
charles
is
not
quite
so
lovely
as
he
was
louisa
is
much
as
i
expected
and
cassandra
i
find
handsomer
than
i
expected
though
at
present
disguised
by
such
a
violent
that
she
does
not
come
down
after
dinner
she
has
charming
eyes
and
a
nice
open
countenance
and
seems
likely
to
be
very
lovable
her
size
is
magnificent
i
feel
rather
languid
and
solitary
perhaps
because
i
have
a
cold
but
three
years
ago
we
were
more
animated
with
you
and
harriot
and
miss
sharpe
we
shall
improve
i
dare
say
as
we
go
on
edward
and
caroline
seem
very
happy
here
he
has
nice
in
lizzie
and
charles
they
and
their
attendant
have
the
attic
anna
will
not
be
surprised
that
the
cutting
off
her
hair
is
very
much
regretted
by
several
of
the
party
in
this
house
i
am
tolerably
reconciled
to
it
by
considering
that
two
or
three
years
may
restore
it
again
godmersham
monday
june
this
morning
brought
me
a
letter
from
knight
containing
the
usual
fee
and
all
the
usual
kindness
she
asks
me
to
spend
a
day
or
two
with
her
this
week
to
meet
knatchbull
who
with
her
husband
comes
to
the
white
friars
and
i
believe
i
shall
go
i
have
consulted
edward
and
think
it
will
be
arranged
for
j
a
going
with
me
one
morning
my
staying
the
night
and
edward
driving
me
home
the
next
evening
her
very
agreeable
present
will
make
my
circumstances
quite
easy
i
shall
reserve
half
for
my
pelisse
i
sent
my
answer
by
them
the
moores
to
knight
my
double
acceptance
of
her
note
and
her
invitation
which
i
wrote
without
effort
for
i
am
rich
and
the
rich
are
always
respectable
whatever
be
their
style
of
writing
ought
i
to
be
very
much
pleased
with
as
yet
i
am
not
james
reads
it
aloud
every
evening
the
short
evening
beginning
at
about

and
broken
by

godmersham
sunday
june
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
writing
to
me
on
thursday
and
very
glad
that
i
owe
the
pleasure
of
hearing
from
you
again
so
soon
to
such
an
agreeable
cause
but
you
will
not
be
surprised
nor
perhaps
so
angry
as
i
should
be
to
find
that
frank
history
had
reached
me
before
in
a
letter
from
henry
we
are
all
very
happy
to
hear
of
his
health
and
safety
he
wants
nothing
but
a
good
prize
to
be
a
perfect
character
they
the
knatchbulls
return
into
somersetshire
by
way
of
sussex
and
hants
and
are
to
be
at
fareham
and
perhaps
may
be
in
southampton
on
which
possibility
i
said
all
that
i
thought
right
and
if
they
are
in
the
place
rs
has
promised
to
call
in
castle
square
it
will
be
about
the
end
of
july
you
and
i
need
not
tell
each
other
how
glad
we
shall
be
to
receive
attention
from
or
pay
it
to
anyone
connected
with
knight
i
can
not
help
regretting
that
now
when
i
feel
enough
her
equal
to
relish
her
society
i
see
so
little
of
the
latter
godmersham
thursday
june
you
are
very
kind
in
mentioning
old
williams
so
often
poor
creature
i
can
not
help
hoping
that
each
letter
may
tell
of
her
suffering
being
over
if
she
wants
sugar
i
should
like
to
supply
her
with
it
i
give
you
all
joy
of
frank
return
which
happens
in
the
true
sailor
way
just
after
our
being
told
not
to
expect
him
for
some
weeks
the
wind
has
been
very
much
against
him
but
i
suppose
he
must
be
in
our
neighbourhood
by
this
time
fanny
is
in
hourly
expectation
of
him
here
mary
visit
in
the
island
is
probably
shortened
by
this
event
make
our
kind
love
and
congratulations
to
her
james
and
edward
are
gone
to
sandling
a
nice
scheme
for
james
as
it
will
show
him
a
new
and
fine
country
edward
certainly
excels
in
doing
the
honours
to
his
visitors
and
providing
for
their
amusement
they
come
back
this
evening
it
is
pleasant
to
be
among
people
who
know
connections
and
care
about
them
and
it
amuses
me
to
hear
john
bridges
talk
of
i
have
thought
a
little
of
writing
to
the
downs
but
i
shall
not
it
is
so
very
certain
that
he
would
be
somewhere
else
when
my
letter
got
there
july
it
will
be
two
years
since
we
left
bath
for
clifton
with
what
happy
feelings
of
escape
in
another
week
i
shall
be
at
home
and
there
my
having
been
at
godmersham
will
seem
like
a
dream
as
my
visit
to
brompton
seems
already
the
orange
wine
will
want
our
care
soon
but
in
the
meantime
for
elegance
and
ease
and
luxury
the
hattons
and
the
milles
dine
here
and
i
shall
eat
ice
and
drink
french
wine
and
be
above
vulgar
economy
luckily
the
pleasures
of
friendship
of
unreserved
conversation
of
similarity
of
taste
and
opinions
will
make
good
amends
for
orange
wine
little
edward

quite
well

and
a
sad
visit

arrived

at

time

for
a
time
all
went

austen
was
suddenly
seized
with
sickness
and
died
before
the
serious
nature
of
her
attack
had
been
fully
realised

sad
event
occurred
as
the

will
see
between
the
second
and
third
of
the
following
letters

austen
two
eldest
boys
edward
and
george
were
now
at
winchester
school
but
were
taken
away
for
a
time
on
their
mother
death
they
went
at
first
to
the
james
austens
at
steventon
no
one
appearing
to
think
a
journey
to
so
distant
a
county
as
kent
feasible
and
jane
whose
immediate
impulse
seems
to
have
been
to
do
what
she
could
for
her
nephews
resigned
them
rather
unwillingly
for
the
time
on
october
they
went
on
to
their
grandmother
and
aunt
at
southampton
and
then
their
aunt
jane
was
able
to
devote
herself
entirely
to
them
as
her
own
jane
bennet
once
did
to
her
small
cousins
and
to
show
how
her
sense
and
sweetness
of
temper
exactly
adapted
her
for
attending
to
them
in
every
way
teaching
them
playing
with
them
and
loving
them
words
which
she
probably
intended
as
a
description
of
what
cassandra
would
have
done

saturday
october
my
dear
cassandra
your
letter
this
morning
was
quite
unexpected
and
it
is
well
that
it
brings
such
good
news
to
counterbalance
the
disappointment
to
me
of
losing
my
first
sentence
which
i
had
arranged
full
of
proper
hopes
about
your
journey
intending
to
commit
them
to
paper
and
not
looking
for
certainty
till
we
are
extremely
glad
to
hear
of
the
birth
of
the
child
and
trust
everything
will
proceed
as
well
as
it
begins
his
mamma
has
our
best
wishes
and
he
our
second
best
for
health
and
comfort
though
i
suppose
unless
he
has
our
best
too
we
do
nothing
for
we
are
glad
it
was
all
over
before
your
arrival
and
i
am
most
happy
to
find
who
the
godmother
is
to
be
my
mother

some
time
guessing
the
names
about
an
hour
and

half
after
your

two
daughters

two
visitors

debary

his

in

all

longer

the
addition
of
the
two
girls
who
during
the
first
had
one
corner
of
the
table
and
spillikins
to
themselves
was
the
ruin
of
us
it
completed

prosperity
of
debary

them

sat
by

i

him

luck

having
a
very
cold
evening
it
rained

our
company
came

was
dry

before
they
left

ballards

are
unaffected

pleasing

they
do
not
talk
quite
freely

to
be
agreeable
nor
can

discover
any
right
they
had
by
taste

go

had
nearly
completed
her
sixteenth
year
she
was
admirably
adapted
for
the
difficult
position
into
which
she
was
about
to
be
thrown
that
of
companion
to
her
father
mistress
of
a
large
household
and
adviser
to
her
younger
brothers
and
sisters
she
was
sensible
affectionate
and
conscientious
she
did
indeed
prove
another
sister
to
jane
who
as
cassandra
said
afterwards
was
perhaps
better
known
to
her
than
to
any
other
human
being
except
cassandra
herself
though
this
niece
did
not
profess
any
special
literary
ability
her
aunt
always
valued
her
sound
judgment
on
each
new
book
and
in
return
she
gave
her
without
fear
of
offending
advice
on
the
most
delicate
subjects
the
short
extracts
from
fanny
diary
which
her
son
lord
brabourne
gives

how
constantly
jane
was
the

friday

my
dear
cassandra
your
letter
on
tuesday
gave
us
great
pleasure
and
we
congratulate
you
all
upon
elizabeth
hitherto
happy
recovery
or
sunday
i
hope
to
hear
of
its
advancing
in
the
same
style
we
are
also
very
glad
to
know
that
you
are
so
well
yourself
and
pray
you
to
continue
so
we
found
ourselves
tricked
into
a
thorough
party
at
a
quadrille
and
a
commerce
table
and
music
in
the
other
room
there
were
two
pools
at
commerce
but
i
would
not
play
more
than
one
for
the
stake
was
three
shillings
and
i
can
not
afford
to
lose
that
twice
in
an
evening
the
miss
were
as
civil
and
as
silly
as
usual
thank
you
for
your
letter
which
found
me
at
the
breakfast
table
with
my
two
companions
i
am
greatly
pleased
with
your
account
of
fanny
i
found
her
in
the
summer
just
what
you
describe
almost
another
sister
and
could
not
have
supposed
that
a
niece
would
ever
have
been
so
much
to
me
she
is
quite
after
one
own
heart
give
her
my
best
love
and
tell
her
that
i
always
think
of
her
with
pleasure
martha
was
an
hour
and
a
half
in
winchester
walking
about
with
the
three
boys
and
at
the
she
thought
edward
grown
and
speaks
with
the
same
admiration
as
before
of
his
manners
she
saw
in
george
a
little
likeness
to
his
uncle
henry
october
i
have
received
your
letter
and
with
most
melancholy
anxiety
was
it
expected
for
the
sad
news
reached
us
last
night
but
without
any
particulars
it
came
in
a
short
letter
to
martha
from
her
sister
begun
at
steventon
and
finished
in
winchester
we
have
felt
we
do
feel
for
you
all
as
you
will
not
need
to
be
told
for
you
for
fanny
for
henry
for
lady
bridges
and
for
dearest
edward
whose
loss
and
whose
sufferings
seem
to
make
those
of
every
other
person
nothing
god
be
praised
that
you
can
say
what
you
do
of
him
that
he
has
a
religious
mind
to
bear
him
up
and
a
disposition
that
will
gradually
lead
him
to
comfort
my
dear
dear
fanny
i
am
so
thankful
that
she
has
you
with
her
you
will
be
everything
to
her
you
will
give
her
all
the
consolation
that
human
aid
can
give
may
the
almighty
sustain
you
all
and
keep
you
my
dearest
cassandra
well
but
for
the
present
i
dare
say
you
are
equal
to
everything
you
will
know
that
the
poor
boys
are
at
steventon
perhaps
it
is
best
for
them
as
they
will
have
more
means
of
exercise
and
amusement
there
than
they
could
have
with
us
but
i
own
myself
disappointed
by
the
arrangement
i
should
have
loved
to
have
them
with
me
at
such
a
time
i
shall
write
to
edward
by
this
post
with
what
true
sympathy
our
feelings
are
shared
by
martha
you
need
not
be
told
she
is
the
friend
and
sister
under
every
circumstance
we
need
not
enter
into
a
panegyric
on
the
departed
but
it
is
sweet
to
think
of
her
great
worth
of
her
solid
principles
of
her
true
devotion
her
excellence
in
every
relation
of
life
it
is
also
consolatory
to
reflect
on
the
shortness
of
the
sufferings
which
led
her
from
this
world
to
a
better
farewell
for
the
present
my
dearest
sister
tell
edward
that
we
feel
for
him
and
pray
for
him
saturday
night
october
your
accounts
make
us
as
comfortable
as
we
can
expect
to
be
at
such
a
time
edward
loss
is
terrible
and
must
be
felt
as
such
and
these
are
too
early
days
indeed
to
think
of
moderation
in
grief
either
in
him
or
his
afflicted
daughter
but
soon
we
may
hope
that
our
dear
fanny
sense
of
duty
to
that
beloved
father
will
rouse
her
to
exertion
for
his
sake
and
as
the
most
acceptable
proof
of
love
to
the
spirit
of
her
departed
mother
she
will
try
to
be
tranquil
and
resigned
does
she
feel
you
to
be
a
comfort
to
her
or
is
she
too
much
overpowered
for
anything
but
solitude
your
account
of
lizzy
is
very
interesting
poor
child
one
must
hope
the
impression
be
strong
and
yet
one
heart
aches
for
a
dejected
mind
of
eight
years
old
we
are
anxious
to
be
assured
that
edward
will
not
attend
the
funeral
but
when
it
comes
to
the
point
i
think
he
must
feel
it
impossible
i
am
glad
you
can
say
what
you
do
of
knight
and
of
goodnestone
in
general
it
is
a
great
relief
to
me
to
know
that
the
shock
did
not
make
any
of
them
ill
but
what
a
task
was
yours
to
announce
it
i
hope
you
are
not
overpowered
with
as
henry
and
john
can
ease
you
of
many
of
your
correspondents
upon
your
letter
to
goddard
being
forwarded
to
them
mary
wrote
to
ask
whether
my
mother
wished
to
have
her
grandsons
sent
to
her
we
decided
on
their
remaining
where
they
were
which
i
hope
my
brother
will
approve
of
i
am
sure
he
will
do
us
the
justice
of
believing
that
in
such
a
decision
we
sacrificed
inclination
to
what
we
thought
best
i
shall
write
by
the
coach
to
j
and
to
edward
about
their
mourning
though
this
day
post
will
probably
bring
directions
to
them
on
that
subject
from
yourselves
i
shall
certainly
make
use
of
the
opportunity
of
addressing
our
nephew
on
the
most
serious
of
all
concerns
as
i
naturally
did
in
my
letter
to
him
before
the
poor
boys
are
perhaps
more
comfortable
at
steventon
than
they
could
be
here
but
you
will
understand
with
respect
to
it
will
be
a
dreadful
day
for
you
all
whitfield
will
be
a
severe
duty
glad
shall
i
be
to
hear
that
it
is
over
that
you
are
for
ever
in
our
thoughts
you
will
not
doubt
i
see
your
mournful
party
in
my
mind
eye
under
every
varying
circumstance
of
the
day
and
in
the
evening
especially
figure
to
myself
its
sad
gloom
the
efforts
to
talk
the
frequent
summons
to
melancholy
orders
and
cares
and
poor
edward
restless
in
misery
going
from
one
room
to
another
and
perhaps
not
seldom
upstairs
to
see
all
that
remains
of
his
elizabeth
there
must
be
a
letter
missing
between
october
and
october
containing
jane
first
comment
on
the
offer
of
a
cottage
at
chawton
made
by
edward
austen
to
his
mother
in
the
midst
of
his
grief
perhaps
in
consequence
of
his
loss
he
wished
to
bind
his
mother
and
sisters
more
closely
to
himself
he
gave
them
a
choice
between
a
house
near
godmersham
and
one
at
chawton
but
the
mother
and
sisters
were
what
jane
afterwards
called
austens
and
clung
to
their
county
the
offer
was
particularly
opportune
for
austen
was
already
hesitating
between
kent
and
hampshire
as
a
place
of
residence
the
attractions
of
a
home
at
chawton
became
greater
the
more
they
were
considered
and
though
it
was
held
to
be
necessary
to
consult
the
frank
austens
whom
they
would
be
leaving
no
doubt
was
entertained
as
to
their
answer
castle
square
monday
october
my
dear
cassandra
edward
and
george
came
to
us
soon
after
seven
on
saturday
very
well
but
very
cold
having
by
choice
travelled
on
the
outside
and
with
no
great
coat
but
what
mr
wise
the
coachman
spared
them
of
his
as
they
sat
by
his
side
they
were
so
much
chilled
when
they
arrived
that
i
was
afraid
they
must
have
taken
cold
but
it
does
not
seem
at
all
the
case
i
never
saw
them
looking
better
behave
extremely
in
every
respect
showing
quite
as
much
feeling
as
one
wishes
to
see
and
on
every
occasion
speaking
of
their
father
with
the
liveliest
affection
his
letter
was
read
over
by
each
of
them
yesterday
and
with
many
tears
george
sobbed
aloud
edward
tears
do
not
flow
so
easily
but
as
far
as
i
can
judge
they
are
both
very
properly
impressed
by
what
has
happened
miss
lloyd
who
is
a
more
impartial
judge
than
i
can
be
is
exceedingly
pleased
with
them
george
is
almost
a
new
acquaintance
to
me
and
i
find
him
in
a
different
way
as
as
we
do
not
want
amusement
bilbocatch
at
which
george
is
indefatigable
spillikins
paper
ships
riddles
conundrums
and
cards
with
watching
the
flow
and
ebb
of
the
river
and
now
and
then
a
stroll
out
keep
us
well
employed
and
we
mean
to
avail
ourselves
of
our
kind
consideration
by
not
returning
to
winchester
till
quite
the
evening
of
wednesday
the
i
find
sailed
on
the
very
day
of
my
letters
reaching
yarmouth
so
that
we
must
not
expect
an
answer
at
present
we
scarcely
feel
however
to
be
in
suspense
or
only
enough
to
keep
our
plans
to
ourselves
we
have
been
obliged
to
explain
them
to
our
young
visitors
in
consequence
of
fanny
letter
but
we
have
not
yet
mentioned
them
to
steventon
we
are
all
quite
familiarised
to
the
idea
ourselves
my
mother
only
wants
seward
to
go
out
at
midsummer
what
sort
of
a
kitchen
garden
is
there
j
expresses
her
fear
of
our
settling
in
kent
and
till
this
proposal
was
made
we
began
to
look
forward
to
it
here
my
mother
was
actually
talking
of
a
house
at
wye
it
will
be
best
however
as
it
is
i
hope
your
sorrowing
party
were
at
church
yesterday
and
have
no
longer
to
dread
martha
was
kept
at
home
by
a
but
i
went
with
my
two
nephews
and
i
saw
edward
was
much
affected
by
the
sermon
which
indeed
i
could
have
supposed
purposely
to
the
afflicted
if
the
text
had
not
naturally
come
in
the
course
of
mant
observations
on
the
litany
that
are
in
danger
necessity
or
tribulation
was
the
subject
of
it
the
weather
did
not
allow
us
afterwards
to
get
farther
than
the
quay
where
george
was
very
happy
as
long
as
we
could
stay
flying
about
from
one
side
to
the
other
and
skipping
on
board
a
collier
immediately
in
the
evening
we
had
the
psalms
and
lessons
and
a
sermon
at
home
to
which
they
were
very
attentive
but
you
will
not
expect
to
hear
that
they
did
not
return
to
conundrums
the
moment
it
while
i
write
now
george
is
most
industriously
making
and
naming
paper
ships
at
which
he
afterwards
shoots
with
brought
from
steventon
on
purpose
and
edward
equally
intent
over
the
of
twisting
himself
about
in
one
of
our
great
chairs
the
day
began
cheerfully
but
it
is
not
likely
to
continue
what
it
should
for
them
or
for
us
had
a
little
water
yesterday
i
and
my
two
nephews
went
from
the
itchen
ferry
up
to
northam
where
we
landed
looked
into
the
and
walked
home
and
it
was
so
much
enjoyed
that
i
had
intended
to
take
them
to
netley
the
tide
is
just
right
for
our
going
immediately
after
moonshine
but
i
am
afraid
there
will
be
rain
if
we
can
not
get
so
far
however
we
may
perhaps
go
round
from
the
ferry
to
the
quay
i
had
not
proposed
doing
more
than
cross
the
itchen
yesterday
but
it
proved
so
pleasant
and
so
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
that
when
we
reached
the
middle
of
the
stream
we
agreed
to
be
rowed
up
the
river
both
the
boys
rowed
great
part
of
the
way
and
their
questions
and
remarks
as
well
as
their
enjoyment
were
very
amusing
george
enquiries
were
endless
and
his
eagerness
in
everything
reminds
me
often
his
uncle
our
evening
was
equally
agreeable
in
its
way
i
introduced
and
it
was
so
much
approved
that
we
hardly
knew
how
to
leave
off
of
chawton
i
think
i
can
have
nothing
more
to
say
but
that
everything
you
say
about
it
in
the
letter
now
before
me
will
i
am
sure
as
soon
as
i
am
able
to
read
it
to
her
make
my
mother
consider
the
plan
with
more
and
more
pleasure
sunday
november
your
letter
my
dear
cassandra
obliges
me
to
write
immediately
that
you
may
have
the
earliest
notice
of
frank
intending
if
possible
to
go
to
godmersham
exactly
at
the
time
now
fixed
for
your
visit
to
goodnestone
your
news
of
edward
bridges
was
news
for
i
have
had
no
letter
from
wrotham
i
wish
him
happy
with
all
my
heart
and
hope
his
choice
may
turn
out
according
to
his
own
expectations
and
beyond
those
of
his
family
and
i
dare
say
it
will
marriage
is
a
great
improver
and
in
a
similar
situation
harriet
may
be
as
amiable
as
eleanor
as
to
money
that
will
come
you
may
be
sure
because
they
can
not
do
without
it
when
you
see
him
again
pray
give
him
our
congratulations
and
best
wishes
this
match
will
certainly
set
john
and
lucy
going
there
are
six
bedchambers
at
chawton
henry
wrote
to
my
mother
the
other
day
and
luckily
mentioned
the
number
which
is
just
what
we
wanted
to
be
assured
of
he
speaks
also
of
garrets
for
store
places
one
of
which
she
immediately
planned
fitting
up
for
edward
man
servant
and
now
perhaps
it
must
be
for
our
own
for
she
is
already
quite
reconciled
to
our
keeping
one
the
difficulty
of
doing
without
one
had
been
thought
of
before
his
name
shall
be
robert
if
you
please
yes
the
stoneleigh
business
is
concluded
but
it
was
not
till
yesterday
that
my
mother
was
regularly
informed
of
it
though
the
news
had
reached
us
on
monday
evening
by
way
of
steventon
our
brother
we
may
perhaps
see
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
and
we
mean
to
take
the
opportunity
of
his
help
to
go
one
night
to
the
play
martha
ought
to
see
the
inside
of
the
theatre
once
while
she
lives
in
southampton
and
i
think
she
will
hardly
wish
to
take
a
second
view
how
could
you
have
a
wet
day
on
thursday
with
us
it
was
a
prince
of
days
the
most
delightful
we
have
had
for
weeks
soft
bright
with
a
brisk
wind
from
the
everybody
was
out
and
talking
of
spring
and
martha
and
i
did
not
know
how
to
turn
back
on
friday
evening
we
had
some
very
blowing
weather
from
to
i
think
we
never
heard
it
worse
even
here
and
one
night
we
had
so
much
rain
that
it
forced
its
way
again
into
the
store
closet
and
though
the
evil
was
comparatively
slight
and
the
mischief
nothing
i
had
some
employment
the
next
day
in
drying
parcels
i
have
now
moved
still
more
out
of
the
way
adieu
remember
me
affectionately
to
everybody
and
believe
me
ever
yours
j
a
the
home
at
chawton
was
now
looked
upon
as
a
certainty
though
none
of
its
future
inhabitants
inspected
it
until
february
when
cassandra
visited
it
on
her
way
back
from
godmersham
it
was
some
years
since
they
had
lived
in
the
country
and
their
future
home
was
likely
to
be
very
quiet
so
as
jane
recovered
her
spirits
she
determined
to
crowd
into
her
remaining
months
at
southampton
as
much
society
and
amusement
as
possible
she
went
to
two
of
the
southampton
assemblies
her
last
recorded
appearances
as
an
active
castle
square
friday
december
my
dear
cassandra
soon
after
i
had
closed
my
last
letter
to
you
we
were
visited
by
dickens
and
her
bertie
the
wife
of
a
admiral
i
believe
was
their
first
object
but
they
put
up
with
us
very
kindly
and
finding
in
miss
lloyd
a
friend
of
dundas
had
another
motive
for
the
acquaintance
she
seems
a
really
agreeable
woman
that
is
her
manners
are
gentle
and
she
knows
a
great
many
of
our
connections
in
west
kent
bertie
lives
in
the
polygon
and
was
out
when
we
returned
her
visit
which
are
two
virtues
a
larger
circle
of
acquaintance
and
an
increase
of
amusement
is
quite
in
character
with
our
approaching
removal
yes
i
mean
to
go
to
as
many
balls
as
possible
that
i
may
have
a
good
bargain
everybody
is
very
much
concerned
at
our
going
away
and
everybody
is
acquainted
with
chawton
and
speaks
of
it
as
a
remarkably
pretty
village
and
everybody
knows
the
house
we
describe
but
nobody
fixes
on
the
right
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
knight
for
such
a
proof
of
the
interest
she
takes
in
me
and
she
may
depend
upon
it
that
i
marry
papillon
whatever
may
be
his
reluctance
or
my
own
i
owe
her
much
more
than
such
a
trifling
sacrifice
our
ball
was
rather
more
amusing
than
i
expected
martha
liked
it
very
much
and
i
did
not
gape
till
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
it
was
past
nine
before
we
were
sent
for
and
not
twelve
when
we
returned
the
room
was
tolerably
full
and
there
were
perhaps
thirty
couple
of
dancers
the
melancholy
part
was
to
see
so
many
dozen
young
women
standing
by
without
partners
and
each
of
them
with
two
ugly
naked
shoulders
it
was
the
same
room
in
which
we
danced
fifteen
years
ago
i
thought
it
all
over
and
in
spite
of
the
shame
of
being
so
much
older
felt
with
thankfulness
that
i
was
quite
as
happy
now
as
then
we
paid
an
additional
shilling
for
our
tea
which
we
took
as
we
chose
in
an
adjoining
and
very
comfortable
room
there
were
only
four
dances
and
it
went
to
my
heart
that
the
miss
lances
one
of
them
too
named
emma
should
have
partners
only
for
two
you
will
not
expect
to
hear
that
was
asked
to
dance
but
i
was
by
the
gentleman
whom
we
met
with
captain
we
have
always
kept
up
a
bowing
acquaintance
since
and
being
pleased
with
his
black
eyes
i
spoke
to
him
at
the
ball
which
brought
on
me
this
civility
but
i
do
not
know
his
name
and
he
seems
so
little
at
home
in
the
english
language
that
i
believe
his
black
eyes
may
be
the
best
of
him
captain
has
got
a
ship
having
now
cleared
away
my
smaller
articles
of
news
i
come
to
a
communication
of
some
weight
no
less
than
that
my
uncle
and
aunt
are
going
to
allow
james
a
year
we
hear
of
it
through
steventon
mary
sent
us
the
other
day
an
extract
from
my
aunt
letter
on
the
subject
in
which
the
donation
is
made
with
the
greatest
kindness
and
intended
as
a
compensation
for
his
loss
in
the
conscientious
refusal
of
hampstead
living
a
year
being
all
that
he
had
at
the
time
called
its
worth
as
i
find
it
was
always
intended
at
steventon
to
divide
the
real
income
with
kintbury
i
am
glad
you
are
to
have
henry
with
you
again
with
him
and
the
boys
you
can
not
but
have
a
cheerful
and
at
times
even
a
merry
christmas
we
want
to
be
settled
at
chawton
in
time
for
henry
to
come
to
us
for
some
shooting
in
october
at
least
or
a
little
earlier
and
edward
may
visit
us
after
taking
his
boys
back
to
winchester
suppose
we
name
the
of
september
will
not
that
do
distribute
the
affectionate
love
of
a
heart
not
so
tired
as
the
right
hand
belonging
to
it
tuesday
december
lady
sondes
match
surprises
but
does
not
offend
me
had
her
first
marriage
been
of
affection
or
had
there
been
a
single
daughter
i
should
not
have
forgiven
her
but
i
consider
everybody
as
having
a
right
to
marry
in
their
lives
for
love
if
they
can
and
provided
she
will
now
leave
off
having
bad
headaches
and
being
pathetic
i
can
allow
her
i
can
her
to
be
happy
do
not
imagine
that
your
picture
of
your
with
sir
b
makes
any
change
in
our
expectations
here
he
could
not
be
really
reading
though
he
held
the
newspaper
in
his
hand
he
was
making
up
his
mind
to
the
deed
and
the
manner
of
it
i
think
you
will
have
a
letter
from
him
soon
we
have
now
pretty
well
ascertained
james
income
to
be
eleven
hundred
pounds
curate
paid
which
makes
us
very
happy
the
ascertainment
as
well
as
the
income
i
must
write
to
charles
next
week
you
may
guess
in
what
extravagant
terms
of
praise
earle
harwood
speaks
of
him
he
is
looked
up
to
by
everybody
in
all
america
yes
yes
we
have
a
pianoforte
as
good
a
one
as
can
be
got
for
thirty
guineas
and
i
will
practise
country
dances
that
we
may
have
some
amusement
for
our
nephews
and
nieces
when
we
have
the
pleasure
of
their
company
tuesday
january
i
am
not
surprised
my
dear
cassandra
that
you
did
not
find
my
last
letter
very
full
of
matter
and
i
wish
this
may
not
have
the
same
deficiency
but
we
are
doing
nothing
ourselves
to
write
about
and
i
am
therefore
quite
dependent
upon
the
communications
of
our
friends
or
my
own
wits
the
perhaps
may
soon
be
off
to
help
bring
home
what
may
remain
by
this
time
of
our
poor
army
whose
state
seems
dreadfully
critical
the
regency
seems
to
have
been
heard
of
only
here
my
most
political
correspondents
make
no
mention
of
it
unlucky
that
i
should
have
wasted
so
much
reflection
on
the
subject
i
can
now
answer
your
question
to
my
mother
more
at
large
and
likewise
more
at
small
with
equal
perspicuity
and
minuteness
for
the
very
day
of
our
leaving
southampton
is
fixed
and
if
the
knowledge
is
of
no
to
edward
i
am
sure
it
will
give
him
pleasure
easter
monday
april
is
the
day
we
are
to
sleep
that
night
at
alton
and
be
with
our
friends
at
bookham
the
next
if
they
are
then
at
home
there
we
remain
till
the
following
monday
and
on
tuesday
april
hope
to
be
at
godmersham
william
will
be
quite
recovered
i
trust
by
the
time
you
receive
this
what
a
comfort
his
must
have
been
pray
tell
him
that
i
should
like
to
see
his
work
very
much
i
hope
our
answers
this
morning
have
given
satisfaction
we
had
great
pleasure
in
uncle
deedes
packet
and
pray
let
marianne
know
in
private
that
i
think
she
is
quite
right
to
work
a
rug
for
uncle
coffee
urn
and
that
i
am
sure
it
must
give
great
pleasure
to
herself
now
and
to
him
when
he
receives
it
the
preference
of
brag
over
speculation
does
not
greatly
surprise
me
i
believe
because
i
feel
the
same
myself
but
it
mortifies
me
deeply
because
speculation
was
under
my
patronage
and
after
all
what
is
there
so
delightful
in
a
pair
royal
of
braggers
it
is
but
three
nines
or
three
knaves
or
a
mixture
of
them
when
one
comes
to
reason
upon
it
it
can
not
stand
its
ground
against
speculation
of
which
i
hope
edward
is
now
convinced
give
my
love
to
him
if
he
is
we
are
now
in
and
like
it
very
well
indeed
we
are
just
going
to
set
off
for
northumberland
to
be
shut
up
in
widdrington
tower
where
there
must
be
two
or
three
sets
of
victims
already
immured
under
a
very
fine
villain
charles
rug
will
be
finished
and
sent
to
frank
to
be
consigned
by
him
to
turner
care
and
i
am
going
to
send
out
with
it
very
generous
in
me
i
think
have
you
nothing
to
say
of
your
little
namesake
we
join
in
love
and
many
happy
returns
yours
affectionately
austen
the
manydown
ball
was
a
smaller
thing
than
i
expected
but
it
seems
to
have
made
anna
very
happy
at
age
it
would
not
have
done
for
tuesday
january
i
hope
you
have
had
no
more
illness
among
you
and
that
william
will
be
soon
as
well
as
ever
his
working
a
footstool
for
chawton
is
a
most
agreeable
surprise
to
me
and
i
am
sure
his
grandmamma
will
value
it
very
much
as
a
proof
of
his
affection
and
industry
but
we
shall
never
have
the
heart
to
put
our
feet
upon
it
i
believe
i
must
work
a
muslin
cover
in
satin
stitch
to
keep
it
from
the
dirt
i
long
to
know
what
his
colours
are
i
guess
greens
and
purples
to
set
against
your
new
novel
of
which
nobody
ever
heard
before
and
perhaps
never
may
again
we
have
got
of
by
miss
owenson
which
must
be
very
clever
because
it
was
written
as
the
authoress
says
in
three
months
we
have
only
read
the
preface
yet
but
her
does
not
make
me
expect
much
if
the
warmth
of
her
language
could
affect
the
body
it
might
be
worth
reading
in
this
weather
adieu
i
must
leave
off
to
stir
the
fire
and
call
on
miss
murden
i
have
done
them
both
the
first
very
often
we
found
our
friend
as
comfortable
as
she
can
ever
allow
herself
to
be
in
cold
weather
there
is
a
very
neat
parlour
behind
the
shop
for
her
to
sit
in
not
very
light
indeed
being
southampton
the
middle
of
three
deep
but
very
lively
from
the
frequent
sound
of
the
pestle
and
mortar
tuesday
january
i
had
the
happiness
yesterday
of
a
letter
from
charles
but
i
shall
say
as
little
about
it
as
possible
because
i
know
excruciating
henry
will
have
had
a
letter
likewise
to
make
all
my
intelligence
valueless
it
was
written
at
bermuda
on
the
and
of
december
all
well
and
fanny
still
only
in
expectation
of
being
otherwise
he
had
taken
a
small
prize
in
his
late
cruise
a
french
schooner
laden
with
sugar
but
bad
weather
parted
them
and
she
had
not
yet
been
heard
of
his
cruise
ended
december
my
september
letter
was
the
latest
he
had
received
you
rejoice
me
by
what
you
say
of
fanny
i
hope
she
will
not
turn
this
ever
so
long
we
thought
of
and
talked
of
her
yesterday
with
sincere
affection
and
wished
her
a
long
enjoyment
of
all
the
happiness
to
which
she
seems
born
while
she
gives
happiness
to
those
about
her
she
is
pretty
sure
of
her
own
share
i
am
gratified
by
her
having
pleasure
in
what
i
write
but
i
wish
the
knowledge
of
my
being
exposed
to
her
discerning
criticism
may
not
hurt
my
style
by
inducing
too
great
a
solicitude
i
begin
already
to
weigh
my
words
and
sentences
more
than
i
did
and
am
looking
about
for
a
sentiment
an
illustration
or
a
metaphor
in
every
corner
of
the
room
could
my
ideas
flow
as
fast
as
the
rain
in
the
store
closet
it
would
be
charming
we
have
been
in
two
or
three
dreadful
states
within
the
last
week
from
the
melting
of
the
snow
and
the
contest
between
us
and
the
closet
has
now
ended
in
our
defeat
i
have
been
obliged
to
move
almost
everything
out
of
it
and
leave
it
to
splash
itself
as
it
likes
you
have
by
no
means
raised
my
curiosity
after
caleb
my
disinclination
for
it
before
was
affected
but
now
it
is
real
i
do
not
like
the
evangelicals
of
course
i
shall
be
delighted
when
i
read
it
like
other
people
but
till
i
do
i
dislike
it
your
silence
on
the
subject
of
our
ball
makes
me
suppose
your
curiosity
too
great
for
words
we
were
very
well
entertained
and
could
have
stayed
longer
but
for
the
arrival
of
my
list
shoes
to
convey
me
home
and
i
did
not
like
to
keep
them
waiting
in
the
cold
the
room
was
tolerably
full
and
the
ball
opened
by
miss
glyn
the
miss
lances
had
partners
captain
friend
appeared
in
regimentals
caroline
maitland
had
an
officer
to
flirt
with
and
john
harrison
was
deputed
by
captain
smith
being
himself
absent
to
ask
me
to
dance
everything
went
well
you
see
especially
after
we
had
tucked
neckerchief
in
behind
and
fastened
it
with
a
pin
adieu
sweet
you
this
is
grievous
news
from
spain
it
is
well
that
moore
was
spared
the
knowledge
of
such
a
son
death
monday
january
i
am
not
at
all
ashamed
about
the
name
of
the
novel
having
been
guilty
of
no
insult
towards
your
handwriting
the
diphthong
i
always
saw
but
knowing
how
fond
you
were
of
adding
a
vowel
wherever
you
could
i
attributed
it
to
that
alone
and
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
does
the
book
no
service
the
only
merit
it
could
have
was
in
the
name
of
caleb
which
has
an
honest
unpretending
sound
but
in
coelebs
there
is
pedantry
and
affectation
is
it
written
only
to
classical
scholars
i
am
sorry
to
find
that
sir
moore
has
a
mother
living
but
though
a
very
heroic
son
he
might
not
be
a
very
necessary
one
to
her
happiness
deacon
morrell
may
be
more
to
morrell
i
wish
sir
john
had
united
something
of
the
christian
with
the
hero
in
his
death
thank
heaven
we
have
had
no
one
to
care
for
particularly
among
the
troops
no
one
in
fact
nearer
to
us
than
sir
john
himself
the
store
closet
i
hope
will
never
do
so
again
for
much
of
the
evil
is
proved
to
have
proceeded
from
the
gutter
being
choked
up
and
we
have
had
it
cleared
we
had
reason
to
rejoice
in
the
child
absence
at
the
time
of
the
thaw
for
the
nursery
was
not
habitable
we
hear
of
similar
disasters
from
almost
everybody
yours
very
affectionately

this
letter
brings
the
southampton
series
to
an
end
the
party
were
not
to
take
up
their
residence
at
chawton
till
the
beginning
of
september
but
they
left
southampton
in
april
and
we
may
presume
that
they
carried
out
the
programme
mentioned
in
jane
letter
of
january
and
went
by
way
of
alton
to
bookham
and
on
to
godmersham
in
the
whole
series
of
letters
written
from
southampton
there
is
not
a
single
allusion
to
jane
being
engaged
upon
any
novel
and
it
has
been
inferred
probably
correctly
that
her
pen
was
idle
during
these
years
the
fact
that
she
had
already
written
three
novels
but
had
not
succeeded
in
publishing
a
single
one
can
hardly
have
encouraged
her
to
write
more
but
it
seems
almost
certain
that
a
few
days
before
she
left
southampton
she
made
an
effort
to
secure
the
publication
of
the
novel
which
we
know
as
by
the
publisher
to
whom
she
had
sold
it
as
far
back
as
the
circumstances
are
somewhat
involved
but
appear
to
be
as
follows
among
the
letters
preserved
by
cassandra
is
one
said
not
to
be
in
jane
hand
addressed
to
crosbie
of
which
these
are
the
contents
gentlemen
in
the
spring
of
the
year
a
novel
in
two
entitled
was
sold
to
you
by
a
gentleman
of
the
name
of
seymour
and
the
purchase
money
at
the
same
time
six
years
have
since
passed
and
this
work
of
which
i
am
myself
the
authoress
has
never
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
appeared
in
print
tho
an
early
publication
was
stipulated
for
at
the
time
of
sale
i
can
only
account
for
such
an
extraordinary
circumstance
by
supposing
the
by
some
carelessness
to
have
been
lost
and
if
that
was
the
case
am
willing
to
supply
you
with
another
copy
if
you
are
disposed
to
avail
yourselves
of
it
and
will
engage
for
no
farther
delay
when
it
comes
into
your
hands
it
will
not
be
in
my
power
from
particular
circumstances
to
command
this
copy
before
the
month
of
august
but
then
if
you
accept
my
proposal
you
may
depend
on
receiving
it
be
so
good
as
to
send
me
a
line
in
answer
as
soon
as
possible
as
my
stay
in
this
place
will
not
exceed
a
few
days
should
no
notice
be
taken
of
this
address
i
shall
feel
myself
at
liberty
to
secure
the
publication
of
my
work
by
applying
elsewhere
i
am
gentlemen
direct
to
ashton
dennis
post
office
southampton
april
with
this
letter
was
preserved
the
following
reply
madam
we
have
to
acknowledge
the
receipt
of
your
letter
of
the
inst
it
is
true
that
at
the
time
mentioned
we
purchased
of
seymour
a
novel
entitled
and
paid
him
for
it
the
sum
of
for
which
we
have
his
stamped
receipt
as
a
full
consideration
but
there
was
not
any
time
stipulated
for
its
publication
neither
are
we
bound
to
publish
it
should
you
or
anyone
else
publish
it
we
shall
take
proceedings
to
stop
the
sale
the
shall
be
yours
for
the
same
as
we
paid
for
it
for
crosby
co
i
am
yours
etc
richard
crosby
from
the
fact
that
this
letter
was
carefully
preserved
among
correspondence
from
the
almost
exact
coincidence
of
the
dates
at
which
the
writer
was
to
leave
southampton
and
from
the
fact
that
a
seymour
was
henry
austen
man
of
business
there
can
be
no
reasonable
doubt
that
the
letter
refers
to
one
of
jane
austen
works
it
need
cause
no
surprise
that
she
should
have
written
under
an
assumed
name
or
that
she
should
have
got
some
one
else
to
write
for
her
in
view
of
the
secrecy
which
she
long
maintained
regarding
the
authorship
of
her
novels
if
we
assume
then
that
the
letter
concerns
one
of
jane
austen
novels
which
novel
is
it
at
first
sight
it
might
naturally
seem
to
be
the
story
called
which
was
published
in
the
second
edition
of
the
but
there
are
two
objections
to
this
one
that
so
far
from
making
two
volumes
could
hardly
have
made
more
than
one
very
thin
volume
secondly
that
is
generally
looked
upon
as
an
early
and
immature
production
and
judgment
should
have
been
too
good
to
allow
her
to
desire
the
publication
of
an
inferior
work
at
a
time
when
she
had
already
completed
in
one
form
or
another
three
such
novels
as
and
and
and
if
therefore
it
was
not
what
was
it
we
can
not
doubt
that
it
was
the
novel
we
now
know
as
when
that
book
was
prepared
for
the
press
in
it
contained
the
following
or
prefatory
note
this
little
work
was
finished
in
the
year
and
intended
for
immediate
publication
it
was
disposed
of
to
a
bookseller
it
was
even
advertised
and
why
the
business
proceeded
no
further
the
author
has
never
been
able
to
learn
so
far
this
accords
closely
enough
with
the
history
of
the
as
related
in
the
letter
to
crosby
for
other
details
we
must
go
to
the
where
we
read
it
was
sold
in
to
a
publisher
in
bath
for
ten
pounds
but
it
found
so
little
favour
in
his
eyes
that
he
chose
to
abide
by
his
first
loss
rather
than
risk
further
expense
by
publishing
such
a
work
but
when
four
novels
of
steadily
increasing
success
had
given
the
writer
some
confidence
in
herself
she
wished
to
recover
the
copyright
of
this
early
work
one
of
her
brothers
undertook
the
negotiation
he
found
the
purchaser
very
willing
to
receive
back
his
money
and
to
resign
all
claim
to
the
copyright
this
too
accords
closely
enough
with
the
history
of
the
with
the
exception
of
one
expression
namely
in
bath
but
probably
the
writer
of
the
here
made
a
slip
acting
on
the
very
natural
inference
that
a
book
in
the
main
written
about
bath
by
a
writer
at
that
time
living
in
bath
would
naturally
have
been
offered
to
a
publisher
in
that
town
we
are
indeed
confronted
by
two
alternatives
either
that
jane
austen
in
the
year
sold
two
mss
for
the
sum
of
ten
pounds
each
one
named
to
a
london
publisher
which
has
disappeared
altogether
unless
it
is
the
same
as
the
sketch
which
as
we
have
seen
is
improbable
and
the
other
to
a
bath
publisher
or
that
the
publisher
was
really
a
london
and
not
a
bath
publisher
and
that
the
original
christian
name
of
catherine
morland
was

austin
dobson
in
his
introduction
to
macmillan
makes
the
mistake
of
saying
that
the
of
the
first
edition
of
tells
us
that
the
was
disposed
of
to
bath
bookseller
this
implies
that
if
and
were
the
same
no
arrangement
was
concluded
in
indeed
it
does
not
appear
that
the
author
contemplated
a
at
that
time
and
the
publisher
was
unwilling
to
relinquish
his
rights
on
any
other
terms
later
writers
have
not
even
been
content
to
accept
the

have
found
a
name
and
habitation

publisher
who
purchased

believe
was
bull
oscar
fay
adams
writing
in
of
jane
becomes
more
definite
in
his
statement
that
of
hers
jane
austen
had
yet
been
published
for
although
bull
a
publisher
in
old
bond
street
sc
in
bath
had
purchased
in
the
manuscript
of
for
the
sum
of
ten
pounds
it
was
lying
untouched
and
possibly
unread
among
his
papers
at
the
epoch
of
her
leaving
bath
it
is
true
that
dobson
unable
to
find
the
authority
for
name
is
a
little
more
guarded
when
he
amusingly
writes
in
at
this
distance
of
time
the
genuine
devotee
of
jane
austen
must
be
conscious
of
a
futile
but
irresistible
desire
to
feel
the
bumps
of
that
boeotian
bookseller
of
bath
who
having
bought
the
manuscript
of
for
the
base
price
of
ten
pounds
refrained
from
putting
it
before
the
world
only
two
suppositions
are
possible
one
that
bull
of
the
circulating
library
at
bath
if
bull
it
were
was
constitutionally
insensible
to
the
charms
of
that
which
slipslop
calls
ironing
the
other
that
he
was
an
impenitent
and
irreclaimable
adherent
of
the
author
of
mysteries
of
meehan
in
his
houses
of
bath
and
is
the
most
circumstantial
of
all
writing
on
novel
which
is
full
of

finished
in

in
she
sold
the
manuscript
for

chapter
xiv
and
we
are
now
bringing
jane
austen
to
the
home
which
she
was
to
occupy
through
all
the
remaining
eight
years
of
her
life
the
home
from
which
she
went
to
lie
on
her
deathbed
at
winchester
into
this
period
were
to
be
crowded
a
large
proportion
of
her
most
important
literary
work
and
all
the
contemporary
recognition
which
she
was
destined
to
enjoy
the
first
six
of
these
years
must
have
been
singularly
happy
so
far
as
we
know
she
was
in
good
health
she
was
a
member
of
a
cheerful
family
party
and
she
was
under
the
protection
of
brothers
who
would
see
that
she
and
her
mother
and
sister
suffered
no
discomfort
the
eldest
james
rector
of
steventon
could
reach
his
mother
house
in
a
morning
ride
through
pleasant
country
lanes
edward
the
squire
occasionally
occupied
the
house
at
chawton
and
often
lent
it
to
one
of
his
naval
brothers
while
henry
in
london
was
only
too
happy
to
receive
his
sisters
show
them
the
sights
of
the
metropolis
and
transact
literary
business
at
home
were
her
mother
her
friend
martha
and
above
all
her
self
cassandra
from
whom
she
had
no
secrets
and
with
whom
disagreement
was
impossible
but
besides
all
these
living
objects
of
interest
jane
also
had
her
own
separate
and
peculiar
world
peopled
by
the
creations
of
her
own
bright
imagination
which
by
degrees
became
more
and
more
real
to
her
as
she
found
others
accepting
and
admiring
them
she
must
have
resumed
the
habit
of
writing
with
diffidence
after
her
previous
experience
but
the
sense
of
progress
and
the
success
which
attended
her
venture
in
publishing
and
would
by
degrees
make
ample
amends
for
past
disappointments
she
was
no
doubt
aided
by
the
quiet
of
her
home
and
its
friendly
surroundings
in
this
tranquil
spot
where
the
past
and
present
even
now
join
peaceful
hands
she
found
happy
leisure
repose
of
mind
and
absence
of
distraction
such
as
any
sustained
creative
effort
demands
chawton
was
a
charming
village
about
a
mile
from
alton
and
deep
in
the
country
although
two
main
roads
from
gosport
and
winchester
respectively
joined
on
their
way
towards
london
just
in
front
of
the
austens
cottage
indeed
the
place
still
refuses
to
be
modernised
in
spite
of
three
converging
railways
and
a
necessary
but
civil
notice
in
the
corner
requesting
motorists
to
slowly
through
the
village
the
venerable
then
always
called
the
house
is
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
above
the
church
surrounded
by
garden
meadows
and
trees
and
commanding
a
view
over
the
intervening
valley
to
a
hill
opposite
crowned
with
a
beech
wood
and
known
as
park
the
cottage
is
in
the
centre
of
the
village
and
as
it
actually
abuts
on
the
road
the
austens
could
easily
see
or
be
seen
by
travellers
it
is
supposed
to
have
been
built
as
a
posting
inn
but
it
had
lately
been
occupied
by
edward
austen
steward
the
author
of
the
describes
his
uncle
improvements
to
the
place
in
the
following
words
a
entrance
and
two
made
the
length
of
the
house
all
intended
originally
to
look
upon
the
road
but
the
large
window
was
blocked
up
and
turned
into
a
and
another
opened
at
the
side
which
gave
to
view
only
turf
and
trees
as
a
high
wooden
fence
and
hornbeam
hedge
shut
out
the
winchester
road
which
skirted
the
whole
length
of
the
little
domain
he
goes
on
to
speak
of
the
garden
laid
out
at
the
same
time
which
proved
a
great
interest
to
the
party
of
ladies
and
in
which
old
austen
worked
vigorously
almost
to
the
end
of
her
days
often
attired
in
a
green
round
smock
like
a
labourer
a
costume
which
must
have
been
nearly
as
remarkable
as
the
red
habit
of
her
early
married
life
jane
austen
was
now
between
and
years
old
she
was
absolutely
free
from
any
artistic
from
any
eccentricity
of
either
temper
or
manner
was
a
mind
well
balanced
on
a
basis
of
good
sense
sweetened
by
an
affectionate
heart
and
regulated
by
fixed
principles
so
that
she
was
to
be
distinguished
from
many
other
amiable
and
sensible
women
only
by
that
peculiar
genius
which
shines
out
clearly
in
her
works
her
tastes
were
as
normal
as
her
nature
she
read
english
literature
with
eagerness
attracted
by
the
perfection
of
style
and
still
more
by
the
return
to
nature
in
cowper
and
the
introduction
of
romance
in
scott
but
repelled
by
coarseness
which
she
found
even
in
the
and
the
presence
of
which
in
fielding
made
her
rank
him
below
richardson
as
for
the
latter
circumstance
narrated
in
charles
all
that
was
ever
said
or
done
in
the
cedar
parlour
was
familiar
to
her
and
the
wedding
days
of
lady
and
lady
were
as
well
remembered
as
if
they
had
been
living
friends
her
johnson
was
a
constant
companion
and
a
younger
friend
was
found
in
crabbe
whom
as
she
used
to
pretend
she
was
quite
prepared
to
marry
not
knowing
at
the
time
whether
he
had
a
wife
living
or
not
as
to
her
other
tastes
she
greatly
delighted
in
the
beauties
of
nature
and
no
doubt
would
have
enjoyed
foreign
travel
had
not
that
pleasure
been
quite
out
of
her
reach
her
attitude
to
music
as
an
art
is
more
doubtful
she
learnt
to
play
the
piano
in
her
youth
and
after
spending
many
years
without
an
instrument
took
it
up
again
on
settling
at
chawton
but
she
says
herself
that
she
did
this
in
order
to
be
able
to
play
for
her
nephews
and
nieces
and
when
she
goes
to
a
concert
she
sometimes
remarks
on
her
inability
to
enjoy
it
a
concert
in
sydney
gardens
however
was
not
perhaps
likely
to
offer
to
the
hearer
many
examples
of
high
art
and
we
have
no
means
of
knowing
whether
if
she
had
had
a
chance
of
being
introduced
to
classical
music
it
would
have
appealed
to
her
as
it
sometimes
does
to
intellectual
people
who
have
been
previously
quite
ignorant
that
they
possessed
any
musical
faculty
we
are
told
that
she
had
a
sweet
voice
and
sang
with
feeling
soldier
adieu
and
laddie
survive
as
the
names
of
two
of
her
songs
she
was
extraordinarily
in
anything
which
she
attempted
her
was
both
strong
and
pretty
her
hemming
and
stitching
over
which
she
spent
much
time
have
put
a
to
shame
and
at
games
like
spillikins
or
she
was
invincible
if
this
description
does
not
seem
to
imply
so
wide
a
mental
outlook
as
we
wish
to
see
in
a
distinguished
author
we
must
remember
that
jane
austen
as
her
nephew
tells
us
in
entire
seclusion
from
the
literary
world
and
probably
was
in
company
with
any
person
whose
talents
or
whose
celebrity
equalled
her
own
she
was
in
the
middle
of
a
small
family
circle
the
members
of
which
were
according
to
the
fashion
of
the
times
intelligent
and
refined
but
not
especially
remarkable
for
learning
or
original
thought
they
accepted
the
standards
and
views
of
their
generation
interpreting
them
in
a
reasonable
and
healthy
manner
she
had
therefore
no
inducement
such
as
might
come
from
the
influence
of
superior
intellects
to
dive
into
difficult
problems
her
mental
efforts
were
purely
her
own
and
they
led
her
in
another
direction
but
she
saw
what
she
did
see
so
very
clearly
that
she
would
probably
have
been
capable
of
looking
more
deeply
into
the
heart
of
things
had
any
impulse
from
outside
induced
her
to
try
her
vision
however
might
not
have
remained
so
admirably
adapted
for
the
delicate
operations
nearer
to
the
surface
which
were
her
real
work
in
life
jane
person
is
thus
described
for
us
by
her
niece
anna
now
becoming
a
girl
and
a
keen
observer
figure
tall
and
slight
but
not
drooping
well
balanced
as
was
proved
by
her
quick
firm
step
her
complexion
of
that
rare
sort
which
seems
the
particular
property
of
light
brunettes
a
mottled
skin
not
fair
but
perfectly
clear
and
healthy
the
fine
naturally
curling
hair
neither
light
nor
dark
the
bright
hazel
eyes
to
match
and
the
rather
small
but
nose
this
is
a
delightful
description
but
she
adds
that
in
spite
of
all
this
her
aunt
was
not
regularly
handsome
though
most
attractive
as
to
her
charm
and
lovableness
there
is
absolute
unanimity
among
all
those
who
were
near
enough
to
her
to
know
what
she
really
was
jane
had
by
this
time
seen
a
good
deal
of
society
and
enjoyed
it
though
with
a
certain
critical
aloofness
which
belonged
to
her
family
and
which
was
hardly
to
be
avoided
by
so
clever
a
person
as
herself
this
critical
spirit
was
evidently
a
quality
of
which
she
endeavoured
to
rid
herself
as
of
a
fault
and
one
of
her
nieces
who
was
too
young
to
know
her
aunt
intimately
until
almost
the
end
of
her
life
was
able
then
to
say
was
in
fact
one
of
the
last
people
in
society
to
be
afraid
of
i
do
not
suppose
she
ever
in
her
life
said
a
sharp
thing
she
was
naturally
shy
and
not
given
to
talk
much
in
company
and
people
fancied
knowing
that
she
was
clever
that
she
was
on
the
watch
for
good
material
for
books
from
their
conversation
her
intimate
friends
knew
how
groundless
was
the
apprehension
and
that
it
wronged
her
she
was
not
only
shy
she
was
also
at
times
very
grave
her
niece
anna
is
inclined
to
think
that
cassandra
was
the
more
equably
cheerful
of
the
two
sisters
there
was
undoubtedly
a
quiet
intensity
of
nature
in
jane
for
which
some
critics
have
not
given
her
credit
yet
at
other
times
she
and
this
same
niece
could
joke
so
heartily
over
their
needlework
and
talk
such
nonsense
together
that
cassandra
would
beg
them
to
stop
out
of
mercy
to
her
and
not
keep
her
in
such
fits
of
laughing
sometimes
the
laughter
would
be
provoked
by
the
composition
of
extempore
verses
such
as
those
given
in
the
celebrating
the
charm
of
the
anna
sometimes
the
niece
would
skim
over
new
novels
at
the
alton
library
and
reproduce
them
with
wilful
exaggeration
on
one
occasion
she
threw
down
a
novel
on
the
counter
with
contempt
saying
she
knew
it
must
be
rubbish
from
its
name
the
name
was
and
the
secret
of
which
had
been
strictly
kept
even
from
her
the
niece
who
shared
these
hearty
laughs
with
her
aunts
james
eldest
daughter
anna
differed
widely
from
her
cousin
edward
daughter
fanny
she
was
more
brilliant
both
in
looks
and
in
intelligence
but
also
more
mercurial
and
excitable
both
occupied
a
good
deal
of
thoughts
and
affections
but
anna
must
have
been
the
one
who
caused
her
the
most
amusement
and
also
the
most
anxiety
the
interest
in
her
was
heightened
when
she
became
engaged
to
the
son
of
jane
old
friend
lefroy
anna
giddiness
was
merely
that
of
youth
she
settled
down
into
a
steady
married
life
as
the
careful
mother
of
a
large
family
she
cherished
an
ardent
affection
for
her
aunt
jane
who
evidently
exercised
a
great
influence
on
her
character
jane
austen
literary
work
was
done
mainly
in
the
general
liable
at
any
moment
to
be
interrupted
by
servants
children
or
visitors
to
none
of
whom
had
been
entrusted
the
secret
of
her
authorship
her
small
sheets
of
paper
could
easily
be
put
away
or
covered
with
whenever
the
creaking
which
she
valued
for
that
reason
gave
notice
that
anyone
was
coming
her
needlework
was
nearly
always
a
garment
for
the
poor
though
she
had
also
by
her
some
satin
stitch
ready
to
take
up
in
case
of
the
appearance
of
company
the
nature
of
the
work
will
help
to
contradict
an
extraordinary
misconception
namely
that
she
was
indifferent
to
the
needs
and
claims
of
the
poor
an
idea
probably
based
on
the
fact
that
she
never
used
them
as
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth
she
was
of
course
quite
ignorant
of
the
conditions
of
life
in
the
great
towns
and
she
had
but
little
money
to
give
but
work
teaching
and
sympathy
were
freely
bestowed
on
rustic
neighbours
a
very
good
criterion
of
her
attitude
towards
her
own
characters
is
often
furnished
by
their
relations
with
the
poor
around
them
instances
of
this
may
be
found
in
darcy
care
of
his
tenants
and
servants
in
anne
farewell
visits
to
nearly
all
the
inhabitants
of
kellynch
and
in
benevolence
and
good
sense
when
assisting
her
poorer
neighbours
so
began
the
austens
life
at
chawton
probably
a
quieter
life
than
any
they
had
yet
led
their
nearest
neighbours
being
the
middletons
who
rented
the
house
for
five
years
and
were
still
its
inmates
the
benns
at
faringdon
the
harry
digweeds
papillon
the
rector
a
bachelor
living
with
his
sister
and
the
clements
and
prowting
families
the
ladies
took
possession
of
their
cottage
on
july
and
the
first
news
that
we
have
of
them
is
in
a
letter
from
knight
dated
october
heard
of
the
chawton
party
looking
very
comfortable
at
breakfast
from
a
gentleman
who
was
travelling
by
their
door
in
a
about
ten
days
ago
after
this
the
curtain
falls
again
and
we
have
no
letters
and
no
information
for
a
year
and
a
half
from
this
time
we
are
sure
however
that
jane
settled
down
to
her
writing
very
soon
for
by
april
and
was
in
the
printers
hands
and
and
far
advanced
since
her
fit
of
youthful
enthusiasm
when
she
had
composed
three
stories
in
little
more
than
three
years
she
had
had
much
experience
of
life
to
sober
and
strengthen
her
three
changes
of
residence
the
loss
of
her
father
the
friendship
of
lefroy
and
the
shock
of
her
death
her
own
and
her
sister
sad
love
stories
the
crisis
in
the
leigh
perrot
history
and
her
literary
disappointments
all
these
must
have
made
her
take
up
her
two
old
works
with
a
chastened
spirit
and
a
more
mature
judgment
we
can
not
doubt
that
extensive
alterations
were
made
in
fact
we
know
that
this
was
the
case
with
and
we
feel
equally
certain
that
of
the
two
works
and
was
essentially
the
earlier
both
in
conception
and
in
composition
and
that
no
one
could
have
sat
down
to
write
that
work
who
had
already
written
and
there
is
indeed
no
lack
of
humour
in
the
earlier
work
the
names
of
jennings
john
dashwood
and
the
palmers
are
enough
to
assure
us
of
this
but
the
humorous
parts
are
not
nearly
so
essential
to
the
story
as
they
become
in
her
later
novels
the
plot
is
desultory
and
the
principal
characters
lack
interest
we
feel
in
the
presence
of
the
virtue
and
sense
of
elinor
a
rebuke
which
never
affects
us
in
the
same
way
with
jane
bennet
fanny
price
or
anne
elliot
while
marianne
is
often
exasperating
edward
ferrars
is
rather
stiff
and
colonel
brandon
is
so
far
removed
from
us
that
we
never
even
learn
his
christian
name
mr
helm
makes
some
acute
remarks
on
the
freedom
which
elinor
shows
in
talking
of
embarrassing
subjects
with
willoughby
and
on
her
readiness
to
attribute
his
fall
to
the
world
rather
than
to
himself
we
are
to
imagine
however
that
elinor
had
been
attracted
by
him
before
and
felt
his
personal
charm
again
while
she
was
under
its
spell
all
the
more
because
she
was
herself
in
a
special
state
of
excitement
from
the
rapid
changes
in
marianne
condition
and
the
expectation
of
seeing
her
mother
her
excuses
for
willoughby
were
so
far
from
representing
any
opinion
of
the
author
that
they
did
not
even
represent
her
own
after
a
few
hours
of
reflection
it
is
one
of
the
many
instances
which
we
have
of
jane
austen
subtle
dramatic
instinct
on
the
whole
there
is
great
merit
in
the
book
and
much
amusement
to
be
got
from
it
but
it
seems
natural
to
look
upon
it
as
an
experiment
on
the
part
of
the
author
before
she
put
forth
her
full
powers
in
and
we
are
glad
by
the
way
to
hear
from
jane
herself
that
miss
steele
never
caught
the
doctor
after
all
we
must
now
accompany
the
author
to
london
whither
she
went
in
april
to
stay
with
her
brother
henry
and
his
wife
who
had
moved
from
brompton
to
sloane
street
having
been
preceded
by
her
novel
then
in
the
hands
of
the
printers
cassandra
had
in
the
meanwhile
gone
to
godmersham
sloane
street
thursday
april
my
dear
cassandra
the
badness
of
the
weather
disconcerted
an
excellent
plan
of
mine
that
of
calling
on
miss
beckford
again
but
from
the
middle
of
the
day
it
rained
incessantly
mary
and
i
after
disposing
of
her
father
and
mother
went
to
the
liverpool
museum
and
the
british
gallery
and
i
had
some
amusement
at
each
though
my
preference
for
men
and
women
always
inclines
me
to
attend
more
to
the
company
than
the
sight
i
did
not
see
theo
till
late
on
tuesday
he
was
gone
to
ilford
but
he
came
back
in
time
to
show
his
usual
harmless
heartless
civility
henry
who
had
been
confined
the
whole
day
to
the
bank
took
me
in
his
way
home
and
after
putting
life
and
wit
into
the
party
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
put
himself
and
his
sister
into
a
hackney
coach
eliza
is
walking
out
by
herself
she
has
plenty
of
business
on
her
hands
just
now
for
the
day
of
the
party
is
settled
and
drawing
near
above
people
are
invited
for
next
tuesday
evening
and
there
is
to
be
some
very
good
music
five
professionals
three
of
them
glee
singers
besides
amateurs
fanny
will
listen
to
this
one
of
the
hirelings
is
a
capital
on
the
harp
from
which
i
expect
great
pleasure
the
foundation
of
the
party
was
a
dinner
to
henry
egerton
and
henry
walter
but
the
latter
leaves
town
the
day
before
i
am
sorry
as
i
wished
prejudice
to
be
done
away
but
should
have
been
more
sorry
if
there
had
been
no
invitation
i
am
a
wretch
to
be
so
occupied
with
all
these
things
as
to
seem
to
have
no
thoughts
to
give
to
people
and
circumstances
which
really
supply
a
far
more
lasting
interest
the
society
in
which
you
are
but
i
do
think
of
you
all
i
assure
you
and
want
to
know
all
about
everybody
and
especially
about
your
visit
to
the
friars
le
moyen
not
to
be
occupied
by
one
own
concerns
frank
is
superseded
in
the
henry
brought
us
this
news
yesterday
from
daysh
and
he
heard
at
the
same
time
that
charles
may
be
in
england
in
the
course
of
a
month
sir
edward
pollen
succeeds
lord
gambier
in
his
command
and
some
captain
of
his
succeeds
frank
and
i
believe
the
order
is
already
gone
out
henry
means
to
enquire
farther
he
wrote
to
mary
on
the
occasion
this
is
something
to
think
of
henry
is
convinced
that
he
will
have
the
offer
of
something
else
but
does
not
think
it
will
be
at
all
incumbent
on
him
to
accept
it
and
then
follows
what
will
he
do
and
where
will
he
live
the
and
comte
julien
can
not
come
to
the
party
which
was
at
first
a
grief
but
she
has
since
supplied
herself
so
well
with
performers
that
it
is
of
no
consequence
their
not
coming
has
produced
our
going
to
them
evening
which
i
like
the
idea
of
it
will
be
amusing
to
see
the
ways
of
a
french
circle
our
first
object
was
henrietta
to
consult
with
henry
in
consequence
of
a
very
unlucky
change
of
the
play
for
this
very
night
instead
of
and
we
are
to
go
on
monday
to
instead
but
it
is
a
disappointment
to
us
both
love
to
all
thursday
april
no
indeed
i
am
never
too
busy
to
think
of
and
i
can
no
more
forget
it
than
a
mother
can
forget
her
sucking
child
and
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
enquiries
i
have
had
two
sheets
to
correct
but
the
last
only
brings
us
to
willoughby
first
appearance
regrets
in
the
most
flattering
manner
that
she
must
wait
may
but
i
have
scarcely
a
hope
of
its
being
out
in
june
henry
does
not
neglect
it
he
hurried
the
printer
and
says
he
will
see
him
again
it
will
not
stand
still
during
his
absence
it
will
be
sent
to
eliza
the
remain
as
they
were
but
i
will
get
them
altered
if
i
can
i
am
very
much
gratified
by
interest
in
it
and
whatever
may
be
the
event
of
it
as
to
my
credit
with
her
sincerely
wish
her
curiosity
could
be
satisfied
sooner
than
is
now
probable
i
think
she
will
like
my
elinor
but
can
not
build
on
anything
else
our
party
went
off
extremely
well
there
were
many
solicitudes
alarms
and
vexations
beforehand
of
course
but
at
last
everything
was
quite
right
the
rooms
were
dressed
up
with
flowers
and
looked
very
pretty
a
glass
for
the
mantelpiece
was
lent
by
the
man
who
is
making
their
own
egerton
and
walter
came
at
five
and
the
festivities
began
with
a
pair
of
very
fine
soles
yes
walter
for
he
postponed
his
leaving
london
on
purpose
which
did
not
give
much
pleasure
at
the
time
any
more
than
the
circumstance
from
which
it
rose
his
calling
on
sunday
and
being
asked
by
henry
to
take
the
family
dinner
on
that
day
which
he
did
but
it
is
all
smoothed
over
now
and
she
likes
him
very
well
at
seven
arrived
the
musicians
in
two
hackney
coaches
and
by
eight
the
lordly
company
began
to
appear
among
the
earliest
were
george
and
mary
cooke
and
i
spent
the
greatest
part
of
the
evening
very
pleasantly
with
them
the
being
soon
hotter
than
we
liked
we
placed
ourselves
in
the
connecting
passage
which
was
comparatively
cool
and
gave
us
all
the
advantage
of
the
music
at
a
pleasant
distance
as
well
as
that
of
the
first
view
of
every
new
comer
i
was
quite
surrounded
by
acquaintance
especially
gentlemen
and
what
with
hampson
seymour
knatchbull
guillemarde
mr
cure
a
captain
simpson
brother
to
captain
simpson
besides
walter
and
egerton
in
addition
to
the
cookes
and
miss
beckford
and
miss
middleton
i
had
quite
as
much
upon
my
hands
as
i
could
do
including
everybody
we
were
which
was
considerably
more
than
eliza
had
expected
and
quite
enough
to
fill
the
back
and
leave
a
few
to
be
scattered
about
in
the
other
and
in
the
passage
the
music
was
extremely
good
it
opened
tell
fanny
with
de
parp
pin
praise
pof
prapela
and
of
the
other
glees
i
remember
peace
love
tunes
red
cross
knight
and
insect
between
the
songs
were
lessons
on
the
harp
or
harp
and
pianoforte
together
and
the
was
wiepart
whose
name
seems
famous
though
new
to
me
there
was
one
female
singer
a
short
miss
davis
all
in
blue
bringing
up
for
the
public
line
whose
voice
was
said
to
be
very
fine
indeed
and
all
the
performers
gave
great
satisfaction
by
doing
what
they
were
paid
for
and
giving
themselves
no
airs
no
amateur
could
be
persuaded
to
do
anything
this
said
captain
simpson
told
us
on
the
authority
of
some
other
captain
just
arrived
from
halifax
that
charles
was
bringing
the
home
and
that
she
was
probably
by
this
time
in
the
channel
but
as
captain
was
certainly
in
liquor
we
must
not
quite
depend
on
it
it
must
give
one
a
sort
of
expectation
however
and
will
prevent
my
writing
to
him
any
more
i
would
rather
he
should
not
reach
england
till
i
am
at
home
and
the
steventon
party
gone
my
mother
and
martha
both
write
with
great
satisfaction
of
anna
behaviour
she
is
quite
an
anna
with
variations
but
she
can
not
have
reached
her
last
for
that
is
always
the
most
flourishing
and
showy
she
is
at
about
her
third
or
fourth
which
are
generally
simple
and
pretty
we
go
to
the
play
after
all
on
saturday
we
went
to
the
lyceum
and
saw
the
an
old
play
taken
from
molière
and
were
well
entertained
dowton
and
mathews
were
the
good
actors
edwin
was
the
heroine
and
her
performance
is
just
what
it
used
to
be
i
have
no
chance
of
seeing
siddons
she
act
on
monday
but
as
henry
was
told
by
the
that
he
did
not
think
she
would
the
plans
and
all
thought
of
it
were
given
up
i
should
particularly
have
liked
seeing
her
in
and
could
swear
at
her
with
little
effort
for
disappointing
me
eliza
caught
her
cold
on
sunday
in
our
way
to
the
the
horses
actually
gibbed
on
this
side
of
hyde
park
gate
a
load
of
fresh
gravel
made
it
a
formidable
hill
to
them
and
they
refused
the
collar
i
believe
there
was
a
sore
shoulder
to
irritate
eliza
was
frightened
and
we
got
out
and
were
detained
in
the
evening
air
several
minutes
the
cold
is
in
her
chest
but
she
takes
care
of
herself
and
i
hope
it
may
not
last
long
this
engagement
prevented
walter
staying
late
he
had
his
coffee
and
went
away
eliza
enjoyed
her
evening
very
much
and
means
to
cultivate
the
acquaintance
and
i
see
nothing
to
dislike
in
them
but
their
taking
quantities
of
snuff
monsieur
the
old
count
is
a
very
man
with
quiet
manners
good
enough
for
an
englishman
and
i
believe
is
a
man
of
great
information
and
taste
he
has
some
fine
paintings
which
delighted
henry
as
much
as
the
son
music
gratified
eliza
and
among
them
a
miniature
of
philip
of
spain
louis
xiv
grandson
which
exactly
suited
capacity
count
julien
performance
is
very
wonderful
we
met
only
latouche
and
miss
east
and
we
are
just
now
engaged
to
spend
next
sunday
evening
at
and
to
meet
the
but
le
comte
must
do
without
henry
if
he
would
but
speak
english
would
take
to
him
sloane
street
tuesday
april
my
was
a
like
the
border
to
my
gown
and
a
flower
of
tilson
i
depended
upon
hearing
something
of
the
evening
from
k
natchbull
and
am
very
well
satisfied
with
his
notice
of
me
young
woman
that
must
do
one
can
not
pretend
to
anything
better
now
thankful
to
have
it
continued
a
few
years
longer
we
have
tried
to
get
but
in
vain
i
like
to
know
what
her
estimate
is
but
am
always
half
afraid
of
finding
a
clever
novel
and
of
finding
my
own
story
and
my
own
people
all
forestalled
i
forgot
to
tell
you
in
my
last
that
our
cousin
miss
payne
called
in
on
saturday
and
was
persuaded
to
stay
dinner
she
told
us
a
great
deal
about
her
friend
lady
cath
brecknell
who
is
most
happily
married
and
brecknell
is
very
religious
and
has
got
black
whiskers
yours
very
affectionately
jane
early
in
may
jane
left
london
and
after
paying
a
short
visit
to
hill
catherine
bigg
at
streatham
returned
home
to
chawton
where
she
found
only
her
mother
and
her
niece
anna
chawton
wednesday
may
my
dear
cassandra
you
certainly
must
have
heard
before
i
can
tell
you
that
orde
has
married
our
cousin
margt
beckford
the
marchess
of
douglas
sister
the
papers
say
that
her
father
disinherits
her
but
i
think
too
well
of
an
orde
to
suppose
that
she
has
not
a
handsome
independence
of
her
own
we
sat
upstairs
at
the
digweeds
and
had
thunder
and
lightning
as
usual
i
never
knew
such
a
spring
for
thunderstorms
as
it
has
been
thank
god
we
have
had
no
bad
ones
here
i
thought
myself
in
luck
to
have
my
uncomfortable
feelings
shared
by
the
mistress
of
the
house
as
that
procured
blinds
and
candles
it
had
been
excessively
hot
the
whole
day
harding
is
a
woman
but
not
much
like
toke
inasmuch
as
she
is
very
brown
and
has
scarcely
any
teeth
she
seems
to
have
some
of
toke
civility
miss
is
an
elegant
pleasing
girl
about
nineteen
i
suppose
or
nineteen
and
a
half
or
nineteen
and
a
quarter
with
flowers
in
her
head
and
music
at
her
finger
ends
she
plays
very
well
indeed
i
have
seldom
heard
anybody
with
more
pleasure
friday
may
i
have
taken
your
hint
slight
as
it
was
and
have
written
to
knight
and
most
sincerely
do
i
hope
it
will
not
be
in
vain
i
can
not
endure
the
idea
of
her
giving
away
her
own
wheel
and
have
told
her
no
more
than
the
truth
in
saying
that
i
could
never
use
it
with
comfort
i
had
a
great
mind
to
add
that
if
she
persisted
in
giving
it
i
would
spin
nothing
with
it
but
a
rope
to
hang
myself
but
i
was
afraid
of
making
it
appear
a
less
serious
matter
of
feeling
than
it
really
is
from
monday
to
wednesday
anna
is
to
be
engaged
at
faringdon
in
order
that
she
may
come
in
for
the
gaieties
of
tuesday

common
where
there
are
to
be
volunteers
and
felicities
of
all
kinds
harriet

enn

invited
to
spend
the
day
with
the
john
whites
and
her
father
and
mother
have
very
kindly
undertaken
to
get
anna
invited
also
poor
anna
is
suffering
from
cold
which
is
worse
but
as
she
has
no
sore
throat
i
hope

may
spend
itself
by

a
delightful
evening
with
the
miss

imagined
agreeable
she
desires
her
best
love
to
fanny
and
will
answer
her
letter
before
she
leaves
chawton
and
engages
to
send
her
a
particular
account
of
the
selborne
day
how
horrible
it
is
to
have
so
many
people
killed
and
what
a
blessing
that
one
cares
for
none
of
them
i
return
to
my
from
calling
on
miss
harriot
webb
who
is
short
and
not
quite
straight
and
can
not
pronounce
an
r
any
better
than
her
sisters
but
she
has
dark
hair
a
complexion
to
suit
and
i
think
has
the
pleasantest
countenance
and
manner
of
the
three
the
most
natural
she
appears
very
well
pleased
with
her
new
home
and
they
are
all
reading
with
delight
more
recent
publication
you
can
not
imagine
it
is
not
in
human
nature
to
imagine
what
a
nice
walk
we
have
round
the
orchard
the
row
of
beech
look
very
well
indeed
and
so
does
the
young
quickset
hedge
in
the
garden
i
hear
that
an
apricot
has
been
detected
on
one
of
the
trees
my
mother
is
perfectly
convinced
that
she
shall
not
be
overpowered
by
her
and
i
believe
would
rather
have
more
than
less
god
bless
you
and
i
hope
june
will
find
you
well
and
bring
us
together
thursday
june
anna
does
not
return
from
faringdon
till
this
evening
and
i
doubt
not
has
had
plenty
of
the
miscellaneous
unsettled
sort
of
happiness
which
seems
to
suit
her
best
we
hear
from
miss
benn
who
was
on
the
common
with
the
prowtings
that
she
was
very
much
admired
by
the
gentlemen
in
general
we
began
pease
on
sunday
but
our
gatherings
are
very
small
not
at
all
like
the
gathering
in
the
of
the
yesterday
i
had
the
agreeable
surprise
of
finding
several
scarlet
strawberries
quite
ripe
had
been
at
home
this
would
have
been
a
pleasure
lost
there
are
more
gooseberries
and
fewer
currants
than
i
thought
at
first
we
must
buy
currants
for
our
wine
i
had
just
left
off
writing
and
put
on
my
things
for
walking
to
alton
when
anna
and
her
friend
harriot
called
in
their
way
thither
so
we
went
together
their
business
was
to
provide
mourning
against
the
king
death
and
my
mother
has
had
a
bombasin
bought
for
her
i
am
not
sorry
to
be
back
again
for
the
young
ladies
had
a
great
deal
to
do
and
without
much
method
in
doing
it
yours
affectionately
j
a
the
printing
of
and
can
not
have
been
very
rapid
for
in
september
there
is
the
following
entry
in
fanny
austen
diary
from
at
cass
to
beg
we
would
not
mention
that
aunt
jane
wrote
and
this
looks
as
if
it
were
still
on
the
eve
of
publication
and
it
was
not
in
fact
advertised
until
october
footnotes
see
pp
we
are
told
in
the
biographical
notice
prefixed
to
edition
of
the
novels
in
that
though
jane
when
her
authorship
was
an
open
secret
was
once
asked
by
a
stranger
to
join
a
literary
party
at
which
madame
de
staël
would
be
present
she
immediately
declined
the
invitation
she
had
experienced
a
similar
shock
before
in
the
sudden
death
by
accident
of
her
cousin
jane
williams
this
judgment
is
based
on
the
idea
that
and
admittedly
earlier
than
bore
something
of
the
same
relation
to
and
that
did
to
and
austen
and
her
by

cousin

we

to
jane

her
grandmother
rebecca
hampson
who
married
first
walter
secondly
william
austen
hampson
succeeded
to
a
baronetcy
but
was
too
much
of
a
republican
to
use
the
title
jane
and
her
niece
fanny
seem
to
have
invented
a
language
of
their
own
the
chief
point
of
which
was
to
use
a
wherever
possible
thus
the
piece
of
music
alluded
to
was
the
harp
in
praise
of
bragela
we
learn
from
a
letter
of
cassandra
that
he
arrived
in
time
to
spend
with
his
family
a
week
at
chawton
cottage
he
had
been
absent
almost
seven
years
it
was
their
first
sight
of
his
wife
the
comte
and
his
wife
were
both
of
them
notable
people
had
been
elected
deputy
for
the
to
the
in
and
had
taken
at
first
the
popular
side
but
as
time
went
on
he
became
estranged
from
mirabeau
and
was
among
the
earliest
to
emigrate
in
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
was
engaged
in
plotting
to
restore
the
bourbons
his
wife
had
been
the
celebrated
madame
hubert
of
the
paris
and
was
the
only
woman
ever
known
to
have
inspired
bonaparte
to
break
forth
into

the
count
and
countess
were
murdered

a
novel
by
brunton
published
in
we
can
give
no
explanation
of
the
cousinship
if
any
existed
of
miss
beckford
miss
payne
may
have
descended
from
a
sister
of
grandmother
rebecca
austen
who
married
a
man
of
that
name
perhaps
in
the
battle
of
albuera
may
which
is
described
by
professor
oman
modern
ix
as
most
bloody
incident
of
the
whole
peninsular
war
june
they
ought
to
have
waited
for
the
king
birthday
june
which
was
considered
the
correct
day
to
begin
pease
upon
chapter
xv
and
the
of
and
describes
the
book
as
being
a
lady
this
ascription
satisfied
the
author
desire
for
concealment
but
it
puzzled
the
advertisers
the
first
advertisement
that
in
the
on
october
merely
describes
it
as
novel
called
and
by
lady
in
the
same
paper
on
november
it
is
styled
an
novel
by
lady
while
on
november
it
sinks
to
being
an
novel
but
is
ascribed
to
a
jane
expectations
were
so
modest
that
she
laid
by
a
sum
out
of
her
very
slender
resources
to
meet
the
expected
loss
she
must
have
been
delighted
at
the
result
by
july
every
copy
of
the
first
edition
had
been
sold
and
not
only
had
her
expenses
been
cleared
but
she
was
one
hundred
and
forty
pounds
to
the
good
if
we
compare
this
with
the
thirty
pounds
that
fanny
burney
received
for
the
one
hundred
pounds
that
maria
edgeworth
got
for
or
the
hundred
and
forty
pounds
gained
by
miss
ferrier
for
her
first
novel
we
shall
see
that
jane
austen
had
no
reason
to
complain
the
money
was
no
doubt
very
welcome
but
still
more
important
from
another
point
of
view
was
the
favourable
reception
of
the
work
had
it
been
a
failure
and
an
expense
to
its
author
she
would
hardly
have
dared
nor
could
she
have
afforded
to
make
a
second
venture
on
the
success
of
and
we
may
say
depended
the
existence
of
and
now
she
could
return
with
renewed
spirit
to
the
preparation
of
the
more
famous
work
which
was
to
follow
and
on
which
she
had
already
been
engaged
for
some
time
concurrently
with
her
novel
we
have
no
letters
and
little
news
for
but
we
know
that
in
april
edward
austen
and
his
daughter
fanny
came
to
chawton
house
for
three
weeks
it
was
their
last
visit
as
austens
for
on
the
death
of
knight
his
kind
and
generous
patron
and
friend
in
october
of
that
year
edward
and
all
his
family
took
the
name
of
knight
a
name
which
had
been
borne
by
every
successive
owner
of
the
chawton
estate
since
the
sixteenth
century
in
june
jane
went
with
her
mother
to
stay
for
a
fortnight
at
steventon
rectory
the
last
visit
ever
paid
by
austen
to
any
place
when
she
determined
never
to
leave
home
again
she
said
that
her
latest
visit
should
be
to
her
eldest
son
accordingly
she
went
and
took
a
final
farewell
of
the
place
where
nearly
the
whole
of
her
married
life
had
been
spent
she
was
then
years
old
and
lived
on
for
sixteen
more
but
she
kept
her
resolution
and
never
again
left
chawton
cottage
for
a
single
night
her
long
survival
can
hardly
have
been
expected
by
those
who
had
to
nurse
her
through
frequent
fits
of
illness
but
these
ailments
do
not
seem
to
have
been
of
the
sort
that
kills
she
was
however
always
ready
to
contemplate
the
near
approach
of
death
both
for
herself
and
others
for
in
july
after
buying
some
bombazine
in
which
to
mourn
for
the
poor
king
she
said
i
outlive
him
it
will
answer
my
purpose
if
i
do
not
somebody
may
mourn
for
me
in
it
it
will
be
wanted
for
one
or
the
other
i
dare
say
before
the
moths
have
eaten
it
up
as
it
happened
the
king
lived
nine
more
years
and
austen
sixteen
and
it
was
the
lot
of
the
latter
to
lose
two
children
before
her
own
time
came
when
jane
died
in
the
health
of
her
eldest
brother
james
was
failing
and
two
years
and
a
half
later
he
died
his
mother
lived
on
but
during
the
last
years
of
her
life
she
endured
continual
pain
not
only
patiently
but
with
characteristic
cheerfulness
she
once
said
to
her
grandson
edward
austen
my
dear
you
find
me
just
where
you
left
me
on
the
sofa
i
sometimes
think
that
god
almighty
must
have
forgotten
me
but
i
dare
say
he
will
come
for
me
in
his
own
good
time
our
letters
recommence
in
january
almost
at
the
exact
date
of
the
publication
of
and
a
date
which
will
seem
to
many
people
the
central
point
in
jane
austen
life
she
appeared
indeed
to
be
rather
of
that
opinion
herself
so
far
as
her
modest
unassuming
nature
would
allow
her
to
attribute
importance
to
one
of
her
own
works
she
calls
it
her
child
and
does
not
know
how
she
can
tolerate
people
who
will
not
care
at
least
for
elizabeth
but
we
had
better
let
her
speak
for
herself
the
first
of
the
following
letters
was
written
before
the
publication
took
place
but
the
others
deal
largely
with
and
while
there
is
an
of
allusions
to
now
approaching
completion
chawton
sunday
evening
january
my
dear
cassandra
this
is
exactly
the
weather
we
could
wish
for
if
you
are
but
well
enough
to
enjoy
it
i
shall
be
glad
to
hear
that
you
are
not
confined
to
the
house
by
an
increase
of
cold
we
quite
run
over
with
books
my
mother
has
got
sir
john
carr
in
from
miss
and
am
reading
a
society
octavo
essay
on
the
military
police
and
institutions
of
the
british
by
capt
pasley
of
the
engineers
a
book
which
i
protested
against
at
first
but
which
upon
trial
i
find
delightfully
written
and
highly
entertaining
i
am
as
much
in
love
with
the
author
as
ever
i
was
with
clarkson
or
buchanan
or
even
the
two
smiths
of
the
city
the
first
soldier
i
ever
sighed
for
but
he
does
write
with
extraordinary
force
and
spirit
yesterday
moreover
brought
us
grant
with
white
compliments
but
i
have
disposed
of
them
compliments
and
all
for
the
first
fortnight
to
miss
papillon
and
among
so
many
readers
or
retainers
of
books
as
we
have
in
chawton
i
dare
say
there
will
be
no
difficulty
in
getting
rid
of
them
for
another
fortnight
if
necessary
i
learn
from
sir
carr
that
there
is
no
government
house
at
gibraltar
i
must
alter
it
to
the
commissioner
our
party
on
wednesday
was
not
unagreeable
we
were
eleven
altogether
as
you
will
find
on
computation
adding
miss
benn
and
two
strange
gentlemen
a
twyford
curate
of
great
worldham
who
is
living
in
alton
and
his
friend
wilkes
i
do
know
that
is
anything
except
very
but
was
a
useful
addition
being
an
easy
talking
pleasantish
young
man
a
young
man
hardly
twenty
perhaps
he
is
of
john
cambridge
and
spoke
very
highly
of
walter
as
a
scholar
he
said
he
was
considered
as
the
best
classic
in
the
university
how
such
a
report
would
have
interested
my
father
upon
mentioning
that
she
had
sent
the
to
i
began
talking
to
her
a
little
about
them
and
expressed
my
hope
of
their
having
amused
her
her
answer
was
dear
yes
very
much
very
droll
indeed
the
opening
of
the
house
and
the
striking
up
of
the
fiddles
what
she
meant
poor
woman
who
shall
say
i
sought
no
farther
the
have
now
got
the
book
and
like
it
very
much
their
niece
eleanor
has
recommended
it
most
warmly
to
them
looks
like
a
rejected
addresser
as
soon
as
a
whist
party
was
formed
and
a
round
table
threatened
i
made
my
mother
an
excuse
and
came
away
leaving
just
as
many
for
round
table
as
there
were
at
mrs
grant
i
wish
they
might
be
as
agreeable
a
set
the
miss
sibleys
want
to
establish
a
book
society
in
their
side
of
the
country
like
ours
what
can
be
a
stronger
proof
of
that
superiority
in
ours
over
the
manydown
and
steventon
society
which
i
have
always
foreseen
and
felt
no
emulation
of
the
kind
was
ever
inspired
by
proceedings
no
such
wish
of
the
miss
sibleys
was
ever
heard
in
the
course
of
the
many
years
of
that
existence
and
what
are
their
biglands
and
their
barrows
their
macartneys
and
mackenzies
to
captain
pasley
on
the
military
police
of
the
british
and
the
i
have
walked
once
to
alton
and
yesterday
miss
papillon
and
i
walked
together
to
call
on
the
garnets
had
a
very
agreeable
walk
and
if
had
not
more
shame
for
her
for
i
was
quite
as
entertaining
as
she
was
dame
is
pretty
well
and
we
found
her
surrounded
by
her
healthy
children
i
took
her
an
old
shift
and
promised
her
a
set
of
our
linen
and
my
companion
left
some
of
her
bank
stock
with
her
tell
martha
that
i
hunt
away
the
rogues
every
night
from
under
her
bed
they
feel
the
difference
of
her
being
gone
friday
january
i
hope
you
received
my
little
parcel
by
j
bond
on
wednesday
evening
my
dear
cassandra
and
that
you
will
be
ready
to
hear
from
me
again
on
sunday
for
i
feel
that
i
must
write
to
you
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
have
got
my
own
darling
child
from
london
on
wednesday
i
received
one
copy
sent
down
by
falkener
with
three
lines
from
henry
to
say
that
he
had
given
another
to
charles
and
sent
a
third
by
the
coach
to
godmersham
the
advertisement
is
in
our
paper
for
the
first
time
he
shall
ask
for
my
two
next
and
for
my
stupidest
of
all
miss
benn
dined
with
us
on
the
very
day
of
the
book
coming
and
in
the
evening
we
set
fairly
at
it
and
read
half
the
first
vol
to
her
prefacing
that
having
intelligence
from
henry
that
such
a
work
would
soon
appear
we
had
desired
him
to
send
it
whenever
it
came
out
and
i
believe
it
passed
with
her
unsuspected
she
was
amused
poor
soul
she
could
not
help
you
know
with
two
such
people
to
lead
the
way
but
she
really
does
seem
to
admire
elizabeth
i
must
confess
that
i
think
her
as
delightful
a
creature
as
ever
appeared
in
print
and
how
i
shall
be
able
to
tolerate
those
who
do
not
like
at
least
i
do
not
know
there
are
a
few
typical
errors
and
a
he
or
a
she
would
sometimes
make
the
dialogue
more
immediately
clear
but
i
do
not
write
for
such
dull
elves
as
have
not
a
great
deal
of
ingenuity
themselves
the
second
volume
is
shorter
than
i
could
wish
but
the
difference
is
not
so
much
in
reality
as
in
look
there
being
a
larger
proportion
of
narrative
in
that
part
i
have
and
so
successfully
however
that
i
imagine
it
must
be
rather
shorter
than
and
altogether
now
i
will
try
and
write
of
something
else
and
it
shall
be
a
complete
change
of
subject
ordination
i
am
glad
to
find
your
enquiries
have
ended
so
well
if
you
could
discover
whether
northamptonshire
is
a
country
of
hedgerows
i
should
be
glad
again
thursday
february
your
letter
was
truly
welcome
and
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
all
your
praise
it
came
at
a
right
time
for
i
had
had
some
fits
of
disgust
our
second
evening
reading
to
miss
benn
had
not
pleased
me
so
well
but
i
believe
something
must
be
attributed
to
my
mother
too
rapid
way
of
getting
on
though
she
perfectly
understands
the
characters
herself
she
can
not
speak
as
they
ought
upon
the
whole
however
i
am
quite
vain
enough
and
enough
the
work
is
rather
too
light
and
bright
and
sparkling
it
wants
shade
it
wants
to
be
stretched
out
here
and
there
with
a
long
chapter
of
sense
if
it
could
be
had
if
not
of
solemn
specious
nonsense
about
something
unconnected
with
the
story
an
essay
on
writing
a
critique
on
walter
scott
or
the
history
of
buonaparte
or
anything
that
would
form
a
contrast
and
bring
the
reader
with
increased
delight
to
the
playfulness
and
epigrammatism
of
the
general
style
i
doubt
your
quite
agreeing
with
me
here
i
know
your
starched
notions
the
caution
observed
at
steventon
with
regard
to
the
possession
of
the
book
is
an
agreeable
surprise
to
me
and
i
heartily
wish
it
may
be
the
means
of
saving
you
from
anything
unpleasant
but
you
must
be
prepared
for
the
neighbourhood
being
perhaps
already
informed
of
there
being
such
a
work
in
the
world
and
in
the
chawton
world
the
greatest
blunder
in
the
printing
that
i
have
met
with
is
in
page
where
two
speeches
are
made
into
one
there
might
as
well
have
been
no
supper
at
longbourn
but
i
suppose
it
was
the
remains
of
bennet
old
meryton
habits
tuesday
february
this
will
be
a
quick
return
for
yours
my
dear
cassandra
i
doubt
its
having
much
else
to
recommend
it
but
there
is
no
saying
it
may
turn
out
to
be
a
very
long
and
delightful
letter
i
am
exceedingly
pleased
that
you
can
say
what
you
do
after
having
gone
through
the
whole
work
and
fanny
praise
is
very
gratifying
my
hopes
were
tolerably
strong
of
but
nothing
like
a
certainty
her
liking
darcy
and
elizabeth
is
enough
she
might
hate
all
the
others
if
she
would
i
have
her
opinion
under
her
own
hand
this
morning
but
your
transcript
of
it
which
i
read
first
was
not
and
is
not
the
less
acceptable
to
it
is
of
course
all
praise
but
the
more
exact
truth
which
she
sends
is
good
enough
i
have
been
applied
to
for
information
as
to
the
oath
taken
in
former
times
of
bell
book
and
candle
but
have
none
to
give
perhaps
you
may
be
able
to
learn
something
of
its
origin
and
meaning
at
manydown
ladies
who
read
those
enormous
great
stupid
thick
quarto
volumes
which
one
always
sees
in
the
breakfast
parlour
there
must
be
acquainted
with
everything
in
the
world
i
detest
a
quarto
capt
pasley
book
is
too
good
for
their
society
they
will
not
understand
a
man
who
condenses
his
thoughts
into
an
octavo
miss
benn
dined
here
on
friday
i
have
not
seen
her
since
there
is
still
work
for
one
evening
more
i
know
nothing
of
the
the
are
at
home
and
are
reduced
to
read
they
have
got
miss
edgeworth
i
have
disposed
of
grant
for
the
second
fortnight
to
it
can
make
no
difference
to
which
of
the
fortnights
in
the
year
the
three
volumes
lay
in
her
house
yours
very
affectionately
austen
miss
austen
manydown
by
favour
of
gray
as
she
read
and
and
jane
must
have
become
aware
if
she
did
not
know
it
before
that
she
had
advanced
far
beyond
and
indeed
the
earlier
work
seems
to
fade
out
of
her
mind
so
far
as
allusions
to
its
principal
characters
are
concerned
while
those
of
the
later
novel
remain
vivid
and
attractive
to
their
creator
even
the
minor
characters
were
real
to
her
and
she
forgot
nothing
down
to
the
marriage
of
kitty
to
a
clergyman
near
pemberley
and
that
of
mary
to
one
of
uncle
philips
clerks
in
this
work
there
seemed
to
be
hardly
anything
for
which
she
need
apologise
here
everything
is
complete
the
humour
though
brilliant
is
yet
always
subordinate
to
the
progress
of
the
story
the
plot
is
inevitable
and
its
the
first
proposal
of
darcy
occurs
exactly
when
it
ought
while
all
fear
of
a
commonplace
ending
is
avoided
by
the
insertion
of
the
celebrated
interview
between
lady
catherine
and
elizabeth
it
gives
us
also
an
excellent
example
of
the
way
in
which
jane
austen
composed
her
stories
we
are
always
in
the
confidence
of
the
heroine
who
is
hardly
off
the
stage
throughout
the
whole
novel
we
see
the
other
characters
with
her
eyes
even
when
they
are
persons
like
jane
bennet
with
whom
we
believe
ourselves
to
be
intimately
acquainted
at
the
same
time
such
is
the
subtle
irony
of
the
author
that
we
are
quite
aware
of
her
intention
to
make
us
understand
more
of
the
state
of
mind
than
the
heroine
herself
does
and
to
distinguish
between
her
conscious
and
unconscious
thoughts
elizabeth
has
to
change
from
hatred
to
love
real
hatred
and
real
love
in
a
volume
and
a
half
but
it
would
wound
her
if
she
acknowledged
to
herself
that
the
pace
at
which
she
moved
was
so
rapid
and
the
change
is
constantly
only
half
admitted
even
near
the
end
when
she
says
that
if
darcy
is
prevented
from
seeking
her
hand
by
the
representations
of
lady
catherine
she
shall
soon
cease
to
regret
him
we
know
that
this
is
far
from
the
truth
that
her
affection
is
really
steadfast
and
that
she
is
only
trying
to
disguise
from
herself
her
own
anxiety
other
examples
might
easily
be
found
on
april
occurred
the
death
of
eliza
henry
austen
wife
she
had
suffered
from
a
long
and
painful
illness
and
the
end
was
release
at
last
these
circumstances
would
diminish
the
grief
felt
at
her
loss
but
the
event
must
have
carried
their
minds
back
to
early
days
at
steventon
and
jane
was
sure
to
remember
with
gratitude
the
affection
and
attention
which
eliza
had
bestowed
upon
her
much
younger
cousin
soon
afterwards
henry
went
down
to
chawton
and
on
may
he
drove
jane
up
to
london
in
his
curricle
this
was
a
short
visit
and
owing
to
henry
being
in
deep
mourning
no
theatres
were
visited
jane
went
however
to
three
her
mind
still
full
of
bennets
and
darcys
sloane
street
thursday
may
my
dear
cassandra
before
i
say
anything
else
i
claim
a
paper
full
of
halfpence
on
the
mantelpiece
i
put
them
there
myself
and
forgot
to
bring
them
with
me
i
can
not
say
that
i
have
yet
been
in
any
distress
for
money
but
i
chuse
to
have
my
due
as
well
as
the
devil
how
lucky
we
were
in
our
weather
yesterday
this
wet
morning
makes
one
more
sensible
of
it
we
had
no
rain
of
any
consequence
the
head
of
the
curricle
was
put
half
up
three
or
four
times
but
our
share
of
the
showers
was
very
trifling
though
they
seemed
to
be
heavy
all
round
us
when
we
were
on
the
and
i
fancied
it
might
then
be
raining
so
hard
at
chawton
as
to
make
you
feel
for
us
much
more
than
we
deserved
three
hours
and
a
quarter
took
us
to
guildford
where
we
staid
barely
two
hours
and
had
only
just
time
enough
for
all
we
had
to
do
there
that
is
eating
a
long
comfortable
breakfast
watching
the
carriages
paying
herington
and
taking
a
little
stroll
afterwards
from
some
views
which
that
stroll
gave
us
i
think
most
highly
of
the
situation
of
guildford
we
wanted
all
our
brothers
and
sisters
to
be
standing
with
us
in
the
and
looking
towards
horsham
i
was
very
lucky
in
my
gloves
got
them
at
the
first
shop
i
went
to
though
i
went
into
it
rather
because
it
was
near
than
because
it
looked
at
all
like
a
glove
shop
and
gave
only
four
shillings
for
them
upon
hearing
which
everybody
at
chawton
will
be
hoping
and
predicting
that
they
can
not
be
good
for
anything
and
their
worth
certainly
remains
to
be
proved
but
i
think
they
look
very
well
we
left
guildford
at
twenty
minutes
before
twelve
i
hope
somebody
cares
for
these
minutiæ
and
were
at
esher
in
about
two
hours
more
i
was
very
much
pleased
with
the
country
in
general
between
guildford
and
ripley
i
thought
it
particularly
pretty
also
about
painshill
and
everywhere
else
and
from
a
spicer
grounds
at
esher
which
we
walked
into
before
our
dinner
the
views
were
beautiful
i
can
not
say
what
we
did
see
but
i
should
think
that
there
could
not
be
a
wood
or
a
meadow
or
palace
or
a
remarkable
spot
in
england
that
was
not
spread
out
before
us
on
one
side
or
the
other
claremont
is
going
to
be
sold
a
ellis
has
it
now
it
is
a
house
that
seems
never
to
have
prospered
after
dinner
we
walked
forward
to
be
overtaken
at
the
time
and
before
he
did
overtake
us
we
were
very
near
kingston
i
fancy
it
was
about
six
when
we
reached
this
house
a
twelve
business
and
the
horses
did
not
appear
more
than
reasonably
tired
i
was
very
tired
too
and
very
glad
to
get
to
bed
early
but
am
quite
well
i
am
very
snug
with
the
front
all
to
myself
and
would
not
say
you
for
any
company
but
you
the
quietness
of
it
does
me
good
i
have
contrived
to
pay
my
two
visits
though
the
weather
made
me
a
great
while
about
it
and
left
me
only
a
few
minutes
to
sit
with
charlotte
craven
she
looks
very
well
and
her
hair
is
done
up
with
an
elegance
to
do
credit
to
any
education
her
manners
are
as
unaffected
and
pleasing
as
ever
she
had
heard
from
her
mother
craven
spends
another
fortnight
at
chilton
i
saw
nobody
but
charlotte
which
pleased
me
best
i
was
shewn
upstairs
into
a
where
she
came
to
me
and
the
appearance
of
the
room
so
totally
amused
me
very
much
it
was
full
of
all
the
modern
elegancies
monday
may
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
writing
to
me
you
must
have
hated
it
after
a
worrying
morning
i
went
the
day
before
to
layton
as
i
proposed
and
got
my
mother
gown
seven
yards
at
i
then
walked
into
no
which
is
all
dirt
and
confusion
but
in
a
very
promising
way
and
after
being
present
at
the
opening
of
a
new
account
to
my
great
amusement
henry
and
i
went
to
the
exhibition
in
spring
gardens
it
is
not
thought
a
good
collection
but
i
was
very
well
pleased
particularly
pray
tell
fanny
with
a
small
portrait
of
bingley
excessively
like
her
i
went
in
hopes
of
seeing
one
of
her
sister
but
there
was
no
darcy
perhaps
however
i
may
find
her
in
the
great
exhibition
which
we
shall
go
to
if
we
have
time
i
have
no
chance
of
her
in
the
collection
of
sir
joshua
paintings
which
is
now
showing
in
pall
mall
and
which
we
are
also
to
visit
bingley
is
exactly
herself
size
shaped
face
features
and
sweetness
there
never
was
a
greater
likeness
she
is
dressed
in
a
white
gown
with
green
ornaments
which
convinces
me
of
what
i
had
always
supposed
that
green
was
a
favourite
colour
with
her
i
dare
say
will
be
in
yellow
the
events
of
yesterday
were
our
going
to
belgrave
chapel
in
the
morning
our
being
prevented
by
the
rain
from
going
to
evening
service
at
james
hampson
calling
barlow
and
phillips
dining
here
and
and
tilson
coming
in
the
evening
drank
tea
with
us
both
thursday
and
saturday
dined
out
each
day
and
on
friday
we
were
with
them
and
they
wish
us
to
go
to
them
evening
to
meet
miss
burdett
but
i
do
not
know
how
it
will
end
henry
talks
of
a
drive
to
hampstead
which
may
interfere
with
it
i
should
like
to
see
miss
burdett
very
well
but
that
i
am
rather
frightened
by
hearing
that
she
wishes
to
be
introduced
to
if
i
a
wild
beast
i
can
not
help
it
it
is
not
my
own
fault
get
us
the
best
weather
you
can
for
wednesday
thursday
and
friday
we
are
to
go
to
windsor
in
our
way
to
henley
which
will
be
a
great
delight
we
shall
be
leaving
sloane
street
about
two
or
three
hours
after
charles
party
have
begun
their
journey
you
will
miss
them
but
the
comfort
of
getting
back
into
your
own
room
will
be
great
and
then
the
tea
and
sugar
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
fanny
for
her
letter
it
made
me
laugh
heartily
but
i
can
not
pretend
to
answer
it
even
had
i
more
time
i
should
not
feel
at
all
sure
of
the
sort
of
letter
that
miss
would
write
i
hope
miss
benn
is
got
well
again
and
will
have
a
comfortable
dinner
with
you
we
have
been
both
to
the
exhibition
and
sir
reynolds
and
i
am
disappointed
for
there
was
nothing
like
at
either
i
can
only
imagine
that
prizes
any
picture
of
her
too
much
to
like
it
should
be
exposed
to
the
public
eye
i
can
imagine
he
would
have
that
sort
of
feeling
that
mixture
of
love
pride
and
delicacy
setting
aside
this
disappointment
i
had
great
amusement
among
the
pictures
and
the
driving
about
the
carriage
being
open
was
very
pleasant
i
liked
my
solitary
elegance
very
much
and
was
ready
to
laugh
all
the
time
at
my
being
where
i
was
i
could
not
but
feel
that
i
had
naturally
small
right
to
be
parading
about
london
in
a
barouche
i
should
not
wonder
if
we
got
no
farther
than
reading
on
thursday
evening
and
so
reach
steventon
only
to
a
reasonable
dinner
hour
the
next
day
but
whatever
i
may
write
or
you
may
imagine
we
know
it
will
be
something
different
i
shall
be
quiet
morning
all
my
business
is
done
and
i
shall
only
call
again
upon
hoblyn
yours
affectionately
austen
miss
austen
chawton
a
very
happy
summer
awaited
the
cottage
party
godmersham
wanted
painting
and
its
owner
moved
his
family
for
some
months
to
chawton
there
were
almost
daily
meetings
between
the
two
houses
and
the
friendship
between
fanny
knight
and
her
aunt
jane
became
still
closer
as
they
spent
mornings
together
meanwhile
frank
in
command
of
the
was
stationed
in
the
baltic
and
engaged
sometimes
in
convoying
small
vessels
backwards
and
forwards
sometimes
in
protecting
the
transports
which
took
swedish
troops
to
the
seat
of
war
the
following
letter
from
his
sister
jane
reached
him
no
doubt
in
due
course
chawton
july
my
dearest
frank
behold
me
going
to
write
you
as
handsome
a
letter
as
i
can
wish
me
good
luck
we
have
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
from
you
lately
through
mary
who
sent
us
some
of
the
particulars
of
yours
of
june
i
think
written
off
rugen
and
we
enter
into
the
delight
of
your
having
so
good
a
pilot
why
are
you
like
queen
elizabeth
because
you
know
how
to
chuse
wise
ministers
does
not
this
prove
you
as
great
a
captain
as
she
was
a
queen
this
may
serve
as
a
riddle
for
you
to
put
forth
among
your
officers
by
way
of
increasing
your
proper
consequence
it
must
be
a
real
enjoyment
to
you
since
you
are
obliged
to
leave
england
to
be
where
you
are
seeing
something
of
a
new
country
and
one
which
has
been
so
distinguished
as
sweden
you
must
have
great
pleasure
in
it
i
hope
you
may
have
gone
to
carlscroon
your
profession
has
its
to
recompense
for
some
of
its
privations
to
an
enquiring
and
observing
mind
like
yours
such
must
be
considerable
gustavus
vasa
and
charles
and
cristina
and
linneus
do
their
ghosts
rise
up
before
you
i
have
a
great
respect
for
former
sweden
so
zealous
as
it
was
for
protestantism
and
i
have
always
fancied
it
more
like
england
than
other
countries
and
according
to
the
map
many
of
the
names
have
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
english
july
begins
unpleasantly
with
us
cold
and
showery
but
it
is
often
a
baddish
month
we
had
some
fine
dry
weather
preceding
it
which
was
very
acceptable
to
the
holders
of
hay
and
the
masters
of
meadows
in
general
it
must
have
been
a
good
season
edward
has
got
in
all
his
in
excellent
order
i
speak
only
of
chawton
but
here
he
has
better
luck
than
middleton
ever
had
in
the
five
years
that
he
was
tenant
good
encouragement
for
him
to
come
again
and
i
really
hope
he
will
do
so
another
year
the
pleasure
to
us
of
having
them
here
is
so
great
that
if
we
were
not
the
best
creatures
in
the
world
we
should
not
deserve
it
we
go
on
in
the
most
comfortable
way
very
frequently
dining
together
and
always
meeting
in
some
part
of
every
day
edward
is
very
well
and
enjoys
himself
as
thoroughly
as
any
austen
can
desire
chawton
is
not
thrown
away
upon
him
he
will
soon
have
all
his
children
about
him
edward
george
and
charles
are
collected
already
and
another
week
brings
henry
and
william
we
are
in
hopes
of
another
visit
from
our
true
lawful
henry
very
soon
he
is
to
be
our
guest
this
time
he
is
quite
well
i
am
happy
to
say
and
does
not
leave
it
to
my
pen
i
am
sure
to
communicate
to
you
the
joyful
news
of
his
being
deputy
receiver
no
longer
it
is
a
promotion
which
he
thoroughly
enjoys
as
well
he
may
the
work
of
his
own
mind
he
sends
you
all
his
own
plans
of
course
the
scheme
for
scotland
we
think
an
excellent
one
both
for
himself
and
his
nephew
upon
the
whole
his
spirits
are
very
much
recovered
if
i
may
so
express
myself
his
mind
is
not
a
mind
for
affliction
he
is
too
busy
too
active
too
sanguine
sincerely
as
he
was
attached
to
poor
eliza
moreover
and
excellently
as
he
behaved
to
her
he
was
always
so
used
to
be
away
from
her
at
times
that
her
loss
is
not
felt
as
that
of
many
a
beloved
wife
might
be
especially
when
all
the
circumstances
of
her
long
and
dreadful
illness
are
taken
into
the
account
he
very
long
knew
that
she
must
die
and
it
was
indeed
a
release
at
last
our
mourning
for
her
is
not
over
or
we
should
be
putting
it
on
again
for
thomas
leigh
who
has
just
closed
a
good
life
at
the
age
of
poor
leigh
perrot
would
now
have
been
mistress
of
stoneleigh
had
there
been
none
of
the
vile
compromise
which
in
good
truth
has
never
been
allowed
to
be
of
much
use
to
them
it
will
be
a
hard
trial
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
every
copy
of
and
is
sold
and
that
it
has
brought
me
besides
the
copyright
if
that
should
ever
be
of
any
value
i
have
now
therefore
written
myself
into
which
only
makes
me
long
for
more
i
have
something
in
hand
which
i
hope
the
credit
of
and
will
sell
well
though
not
half
so
entertaining
and
by
the
bye
shall
you
object
to
my
mentioning
the
in
it
and
two
or
three
other
old
ships
i
done
it
but
it
shall
not
stay
to
make
you
angry
they
are
only
just
mentioned
i
hope
you
continue
well
and
brush
your
hair
but
not
all
off
yours
very
affectionately

by
young

his
aunt

at

age
of
fifteen

sixteen

soon

she
is
dressed
and
begin
her
letter
we
arrived
at
a
four
and
were
kindly
welcomed
by
the
coachman
and
then
by
his
master
and
then
by
william
and
then
by
perigord
who
all
met
us
before
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
stairs
mde
bigeon
was
below
dressing
us
a
most
comfortable
dinner
of
soup
fish
bouillée
partridges
and
an
apple
tart
which
we
sat
down
to
soon
after
five
after
cleaning
and
dressing
ourselves
and
feeling
that
we
were
most
commodiously
disposed
of
the
little
adjoining
to
our
apartment
makes
fanny
and
myself
very
well
off
indeed
and
as
we
have
poor
eliza
bed
our
space
is
ample
every
way
lady
robert
is
delighted
with
and
and
really
so
as
i
understand
before
she
knew
who
wrote
it
for
of
course
she
knows
now
he
told
her
with
as
much
satisfaction
as
if
it
were
my
wish
he
did
not
tell
this
but
he
told
fanny
and
hastings
i
am
quite
delighted
with
what
such
a
man
writes
about
it
henry
sent
him
the
books
after
his
return
from
daylesford
but
you
will
hear
the
letter
too
fanny
and
the
two
little
girls
are
gone
to
take
places
for
at
covent
garden
and
the
latter
will
be
a
fine
show
for
and
they
revelled
last
night
in
whom
we
left
in
hell
at
eleven
we
had
scaramouch
and
a
ghost
and
were
delighted
i
speak
of
delight
was
very
tranquil
and
the
rest
of
us
were
was
the
last
of
three
musical
things
hours
at
in
three
acts
of
which
one
was
over
before
we
arrived
none
the
worse
and
the
rather
less
flat
and
trumpery
miss
hare
had
some
pretty
caps
and
is
to
make
me
one
like
one
of
them
only
satin
instead
of
blue
it
will
be
white
satin
and
lace
and
a
little
white
flower
perking
out
of
the
left
ear
like
harriot
byron
feather
i
have
allowed
her
to
go
as
far
as
my
gown
is
to
be
trimmed
everywhere
with
white
ribbon
plaited
on
somehow
or
other
she
says
it
will
look
well
i
am
not
sanguine
they
trim
with
white
very
much
hall
was
very
punctual
yesterday
and
curled
me
out
at
a
great
rate
i
thought
it
looked
hideous
and
longed
for
a
snug
cap
instead
but
my
companions
silenced
me
by
their
admiration
we
had
very
good
places
in
the
box
next
the
front
and
second
row
the
three
old
ones
behind
of
course
i
was
particularly
disappointed
at
seeing
nothing
of
crabbe
i
felt
sure
of
him
when
i
saw
that
the
boxes
were
fitted
up
with
crimson
velvet
it
was
not
possible
for
me
to
get
the
worsteds
yesterday
i
heard
edward
last
night
pressing
henry
to
come
to
godmersham
and
i
think
henry
engaged
to
go
there
after
his
november
collection
nothing
has
been
done
as
to
and
the
books
came
to
hand
too
late
for
him
to
have
time
for
it
before
he
went
i
long
to
have
you
hear
opinion
of
and
his
admiring
my
elizabeth
so
much
is
particularly
welcome
to
me
miss
austen
chawton
her
delight
at
the
appreciation
of
her
book
by
warren
hastings
may
be
compared
with
a
passage
from
madame
diary
which
forms
a
curious
link
between
the
two
writers
cooke
jane
austen
cousin
my
excellent
neighbour
came
in
just
now
to
read
me
a
paragraph
of
a
letter
from
leigh
of
oxfordshire
her
sister
after
much
civility
about
the
new
work
and
its
author
it
finishes
thus
hastings
i
saw
just
now
i
told
him
what
was
going
forward
he
gave
a
great
jump
and
exclaimed
well
then
now
i
can
serve
her
thank
heaven
and
i
will
i
will
write
to
anderson
to
engage
scotland
and
i
will
attack
the
east
indies
myself
henrietta
street
thursday
september
after
dinner
thank
you
my
dearest
cassandra
for
the
nice
long
letter
i
sent
off
this
morning
we
are
now
all
four
of
us
young
ladies
sitting
round
the
circular
table
in
the
inner
room
writing
our
letters
while
the
two
brothers
are
having
a
comfortable
coze
in
the
room
adjoining
it
is
to
be
a
quiet
evening
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
four
of
the
six
my
eyes
are
quite
tired
of
dust
and
lamps
we
went
to
wedgwood
where
my
brother
and
fanny
chose
a
dinner
set
i
believe
the
pattern
is
a
small
lozenge
in
purple
between
lines
of
narrow
gold
and
it
is
to
have
the
crest
with
love
to
you
all
including
triggs
i
remain
yours
very
affectionately
austen
the
journey
from
london
to
godmersham
was
no
doubt
duly
narrated
in
a
letter
now
missing
those
from
godmersham
are
filled
with
the
ordinary
comings
and
goings
of
a
large
family
party
and
allusions
to
kent
neighbours
of
whom
cassandra
would
know
just
enough
to
be
interested
in
their
proceedings
godmersham
park
thursday
september
my
dearest
cassandra
thank
you
five
hundred
and
forty
times
for
the
exquisite
piece
of
workmanship
which
was
brought
into
the
room
this
morning
while
we
were
at
breakfast
with
some
very
inferior
works
of
art
in
the
same
way
and
which
i
read
with
high
glee
much
delighted
with
everything
it
told
whether
good
or
bad
it
is
so
rich
in
striking
intelligence
that
i
hardly
know
what
to
reply
to
first
i
believe
finery
must
have
it
i
am
extremely
glad
that
you
like
the
poplin
i
thought
it
would
have
my
mother
approbation
but
was
not
so
confident
of
yours
remember
that
it
is
a
present
do
not
refuse
me
i
am
very
rich
let
me
know
when
you
begin
the
new
tea
and
the
new
white
wine
my
present
elegancies
have
not
yet
made
me
indifferent
to
such
matters
i
am
still
a
cat
if
i
see
a
mouse
night
and
the
landscape
is
lovely
no
more
but
to
make
amends
for
that
our
visit
to
the
tyldens
is
over
my
brother
fanny
and
i
went
geo
stayed
at
home
with
there
was
nothing
entertaining
or
out
of
the
common
way
we
met
only
tyldens
and
double
tyldens

for
the
gentlemen
a
musical
young
lady
to
play
backgammon
with
fanny

the
morning
we
returned

like
very
much
poor
isham

obliged
to
admire
and
and
to
send
me
word
that
he
is
sure
he
shall
not
like
madame
new
novel
half
so
well
c
ooke

of
course
he
desires
his
compliments
to
you
and
my
mother
i
am
now
alone
in
the
library
mistress
of
all
i
survey
at
least
i
may
say
so
and
repeat
the
whole
poem
if
i
like
it
without
offence
to
anybody
i
have
moment
seen
driver
driven
up
to
the
kitchen
door
i
can
not
close
with
a
grander
circumstance
or
greater
wit
yours
affectionately

a
miss
austen
chawton
the
next
of
jane
surviving
letters
was
addressed
to
her
brother
frank
godmersham
park
september
my
dearest
frank
the
of
this
month
brought
me
your
letter
and
i
assure
you
i
thought
it
very
well
worth
its
two
and
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
filling
me
so
long
a
sheet
of
paper
you
are
a
good
one
to
traffic
with
in
that
way
you
pay
most
liberally
my
letter
was
a
scratch
of
a
note
compared
to
yours
and
then
you
write
so
even
so
clear
both
in
style
and
penmanship
so
much
to
the
point
and
give
so
much
intelligence
that
it
is
enough
to
kill
one
i
am
sorry
sweden
is
so
poor
and
my
riddle
so
bad
the
idea
of
a
fashionable
in
mecklenberg
how
can
people
pretend
to
be
fashionable
or
to
bathe
out
of
england
rostock
market
makes
one
mouth
water
our
cheapest
butcher
meat
is
double
the
price
of
theirs
nothing
under
all
this
summer
and
i
believe
upon
recollection
nothing
under
bread
has
sunk
and
is
likely
to
sink
more
which
we
hope
may
make
meat
sink
too
but
i
have
no
occasion
to
think
of
the
price
of
bread
or
of
meat
where
i
am
now
let
me
shake
off
vulgar
cares
and
conform
to
the
happy
indifference
of
east
kent
wealth
i
wonder
whether
you
and
the
king
of
sweden
knew
that
i
was
come
to
godmersham
with
my
brother
yes
i
suppose
you
have
received
due
notice
of
it
by
some
means
or
other
i
have
not
been
here
these
four
years
so
i
am
sure
the
event
deserves
to
be
talked
of
before
and
behind
as
well
as
in
the
middle
we
left
chawton
on
the
spent
two
entire
days
in
town
and
arrived
here
on
the
my
brother
fanny
lizzie
marianne
and
i
composed
this
division
of
the
family
and
filled
his
carriage
inside
and
out
two
under
the
escort
of
george
conveyed
eight
more
across
the
country
the
chair
brought
two
two
others
came
on
horseback
and
the
rest
by
coach
and
so
by
one
means
or
another
we
all
are
removed
it
puts
me
in
remind
of
paul
shipwreck
when
all
are
said
by
different
means
to
reach
the
shore
in
safety
i
left
my
mother
cassandra
and
martha
well
and
have
had
good
accounts
of
them
since
at
present
they
are
quite
alone
but
they
are
going
to
be
visited
by
heathcote
and
miss
bigg
and
to
have
a
few
days
of
henry
company
likewise
of
our
three
evenings
in
town
one
was
spent
at
the
lyceum
and
another
at
covent
garden
clandestine
was
the
most
respectable
of
the
performances
the
rest
were
and
trumpery
but
it
did
very
well
for
lizzie
and
marianne
who
were
indeed
delighted
but
i
wanted
better
acting
there
was
no
actor
worth
naming
i
believe
the
theatres
are
thought
at
a
very
low
ebb
at
present
henry
has
probably
sent
you
his
own
account
of
his
visit
in
scotland
i
wish
he
had
had
more
time
and
could
have
gone
further
north
and
deviated
to
the
lakes
on
his
way
back
but
what
he
was
able
to
do
seems
to
have
afforded
him
great
enjoyment
and
he
met
with
scenes
of
higher
beauty
in
roxburghshire
than
i
had
supposed
the
south
of
scotland
possessed
our
gratification
was
less
keen
than
our
brother
edward
is
no
enthusiast
in
the
beauties
of
nature
his
enthusiasm
is
for
the
sports
of
the
field
only
he
is
a
very
promising
and
pleasing
young
man
however
behaves
with
great
propriety
to
his
father
and
great
kindness
to
his
brothers
and
sisters
and
we
must
forgive
his
thinking
more
of
grouse
and
partridges
than
lakes
and
mountains
in
this
house
there
is
a
constant
succession
of
small
events
somebody
is
always
going
or
coming
this
morning
we
had
edward
bridges
unexpectedly
to
breakfast
with
us
on
his
way
from
ramsgate
where
is
his
wife
to
lenham
where
is
his
church
and
he
dines
and
sleeps
here
on
his
return
they
have
been
all
the
summer
at
ramsgate
for
her
health
she
is
a
poor
honey
the
sort
of
woman
who
gives
me
the
idea
of
being
determined
never
to
be
well
and
who
likes
her
spasms
and
nervousness
and
the
consequence
they
give
her
better
than
anything
else
this
is
an
statement
to
send
all
over
the
baltic
the
knatchbulls
dear
knight
brothers
dined
here
the
other
day
they
came
from
the
friars
which
is
still
on
their
hands
the
elder
made
many
inquiries
after
you
sherer
is
quite
a
new
sherer
to
me
i
heard
him
for
the
first
time
last
sunday
and
he
gave
us
an
excellent
sermon
a
little
too
eager
sometimes
in
his
delivery
but
that
is
to
me
a
better
extreme
than
the
want
of
animation
especially
when
it
evidently
comes
from
the
heart
as
in
him
the
clerk
is
as
much
like
you
as
ever
i
am
always
glad
to
see
him
on
that
account
but
the
sherers
are
going
away
he
has
a
bad
curate
at
westwell
whom
he
can
eject
only
by
residing
there
himself
he
goes
nominally
for
three
years
and
a
paget
is
to
have
the
curacy
of
godmersham
a
married
man
with
a
very
musical
wife
which
i
hope
may
make
her
a
desirable
acquaintance
to
fanny
i
thank
you
very
warmly
for
your
kind
consent
to
my
application
and
the
kind
hint
which
followed
it
i
was
previously
aware
of
what
i
should
be
laying
myself
open
to
but
the
truth
is
that
the
secret
has
spread
so
far
as
to
be
scarcely
the
shadow
of
a
secret
now
and
that
i
believe
whenever
the
third
appears
i
shall
not
even
attempt
to
tell
lies
about
it
i
shall
rather
try
to
make
all
the
money
than
all
the
mystery
i
can
of
it
people
shall
pay
for
their
knowledge
if
i
can
make
them
henry
heard
and
warmly
praised
in
scotland
by
lady
robert
kerr
and
another
lady
and
what
does
he
do
in
the
warmth
of
his
brotherly
vanity
and
love
but
immediately
tell
them
who
wrote
it
a
thing
once
set
going
in
that
way
one
knows
how
it
spreads
and
he
dear
creature
has
set
it
going
so
much
more
than
once
i
know
it
is
all
done
from
affection
and
partiality
but
at
the
same
time
let
me
here
again
express
to
you
and
mary
my
sense
of
the
kindness
which
you
have
shown
on
the
occasion
in
doing
what
i
wished
i
am
trying
to
harden
myself
after
all
what
a
trifle
it
is
in
all
its
bearings
to
the
really
important
points
of
existence
even
in
this
world
your
very
affectionate
sister
j
a
there
is
to
be
a
second
edition
of
and
egerton
advises
it
the
last
paragraph
of
this
letter
sets
two
things
plainly
before
us
a
strong
preference
for
remaining
unknown
if
she
could
and
the
invariable
sweetness
of
temper
which
forbade
her
to
blame
a
brother
whom
she
loved
because
he
had
made
such
concealment
impossible
that
this
acquiescence
however
was
not
reached
without
a
struggle
the
last
few
words
of
the
paragraph
show
next
follows
a
letter
to
cassandra
dated
monday
october
we
had
our
dinner
party
on
wednesday
with
the
addition
of
and
miss
milles
both
mother
and
daughter
are
much
as
i
have
always
found
them
i
like
the
mother
first
because
she
reminds
me
of
birch
and
secondly
because
she
is
cheerful
and
grateful
for
what
she
is
at
the
age
of
ninety
and
upwards
the
day
was
pleasant
enough
i
sat
by
chisholme
and
we
talked
away
at
a
great
rate
about
nothing
worth
hearing
lizzie
is
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
letter
and
will
answer
it
soon
but
has
so
many
things
to
do
that
it
may
be
four
or
five
days
before
she
can
this
is
quite
her
own
message
spoken
in
rather
a
desponding
tone
your
letter
gave
pleasure
to
all
of
us
we
had
all
the
reading
of
it
of
course
i
as
i
undertook
to
the
great
relief
of
lizzie
to
read
it
to
sackree
and
afterwards
to
louisa
called
here
on
saturday
i
never
saw
her
before
she
is
a
large
ungenteel
woman
with
and
elegant
manners
on
thursday
lushington
for
canterbury
and
manager
of
the
lodge
hounds
dines
here
and
stays
the
night
he
is
chiefly
young
edward
acquaintance
if
i
can
i
will
get
a
frank
from
him
and
write
to
you
all
the
sooner
i
suppose
the
ashford
ball
will
furnish
something
i
am
looking
over
again
and
my
opinion
is
confirmed
of
its
being
an
work
without
anything
of
nature
or
probability
in
it
i
declare
i
do
not
know
whether
laura
passage
down
the
american
river
is
not
the
most
natural
possible
everyday
thing
she
ever
does
i
admire
the
sagacity
and
taste
of
charlotte
williams
those
large
dark
eyes
always
judge
well
i
will
compliment
her
by
naming
a
heroine
after
her
southey
of
i
am
tired
of
of
being
that
i
never
read
any
i
will
read
this
however
if
frank
is
mentioned
in
it
october
now
i
will
prepare
for
lushington
and
as
it
will
be
wisest
also
to
prepare
for
his
not
coming
or
my
not
getting
a
frank
i
shall
write
very
close
from
the
first
and
even
leave
room
for
the
seal
in
the
proper
place
when
i
have
followed
up
my
last
with
this
i
shall
feel
somewhat
less
unworthy
of
you
than
the
state
of
our
correspondence
now
requires
is
about
not
and
not
agreeable
he
is
certainly
no
addition
a
sort
of
cool
gentlemanlike
manner
but
very
silent
they
say
his
name
is
henry
a
proof
how
unequally
the
gifts
of
fortune
are
bestowed
i
have
seen
many
a
john
and
thomas
much
more
agreeable
we
did
not
go
to
the
ball
it
was
left
to
her
to
decide
and
at
last
she
determined
against
it
she
knew
that
it
would
be
a
sacrifice
on
the
part
of
her
father
and
brothers
if
they
went
and
i
hope
it
will
prove
that
has
not
sacrificed
much
it
is
not
likely
that
there
should
have
been
anybody
there
whom
she
would
care
for
was
very
glad
to
be
spared
the
trouble
of
dressing
and
going
and
being
weary
before
it
was
half
over
so
my
gown
and
my
cap
are
still
unworn
it
will
appear
at
last
perhaps
that
i
might
have
done
without
either
i
produced
my
brown
bombazine
yesterday
and
it
was
very
much
admired
indeed
and
i
like
it
better
than
ever
the
comfort
of
the
here
is
very
great
it
draws
all
the
gentlemen
to
it
whenever
they
are
within
especially
after
dinner
so
that
my
brother
fanny
and
i
have
the
library
to
ourselves
in
delightful
quiet
they
came
last
night
at
about
seven
we
had
given
them
up
but
expected
them
to
come
dessert
was
nearly
over
a
better
time
for
arriving
than
an
hour
and
a
half
earlier
they
were
late
because
they
did
not
set
out
earlier
and
did
not
allow
time
enough
charles
did
not
at
more
than
reaching
sittingbourne
by
three
which
could
not
have
brought
them
here
by
dinner
time
they
had
a
very
rough
passage
he
would
not
have
ventured
if
he
had
known
how
bad
it
would
be
however
here
they
are
safe
and
well
just
like
their
own
nice
selves
fanny
looking
as
neat
and
white
this
morning
as
possible
and
dear
charles
all
affectionate
placid
quiet
cheerful
good
humour
they
are
both
looking
very
well
but
poor
little
cassy
is
grown
extremely
thin
and
looks
poorly
i
hope
a
week
country
air
and
exercise
may
do
her
good
i
am
sorry
to
say
it
can
be
but
a
week
the
baby
does
not
appear
so
large
in
proportion
as
she
was
nor
quite
so
pretty
but
i
have
seen
very
little
of
her
cassy
was
too
tired
and
bewildered
just
at
first
to
seem
to
know
anybody
we
met
them
in
the
hall
the
women
and
girl
part
of
us
but
before
we
reached
the
library
she
kissed
me
very
affectionately
and
has
since
seemed
to
recollect
me
in
the
same
way
it
was
quite
an
evening
of
confusion
as
you
may
suppose
at
first
we
were
all
walking
about
from
one
part
of
the
house
to
the
other
then
came
a
fresh
dinner
in
the
for
charles
and
his
wife
which
fanny
and
i
attended
then
we
moved
into
the
library
were
joined
by
the
people
were
introduced
and
so
forth
and
then
we
had
tea
and
coffee
which
was
not
over
till
past
billiards
again
drew
all
the
odd
ones
away
and
edward
charles
the
two
fannies
and
i
sat
snugly
talking
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
our
numbers
a
little
reduced
and
by
the
time
you
receive
this
we
shall
be
only
a
family
though
a
large
family
party
lushington
goes
now
i
must
speak
of
and
i
like
him
very
much
i
am
sure
he
is
clever
and
a
man
of
taste
he
got
a
volume
of
milton
last
night
and
spoke
of
it
with
warmth
he
is
quite
an
very
smiling
with
an
exceeding
good
address
and
readiness
of
language
i
am
rather
in
love
with
him
i
dare
say
he
is
ambitious
and
insincere
he
puts
me
in
mind
of
dundas
he
has
a
wide
smiling
mouth
and
very
good
teeth
and
something
the
same
complexion
and
nose
october
no
i
have
never
seen
the
death
of
mrs
crabbe
i
have
only
just
been
making
out
from
one
of
his
prefaces
that
he
probably
was
married
it
is
almost
ridiculous
poor
woman
i
will
comfort
as
well
as
i
can
but
i
do
not
undertake
to
be
good
to
her
children
she
had
better
not
leave
any
october
our
canterbury
scheme
took
place
as
proposed
and
very
pleasant
it
was
harriot
and
i
and
little
george
within
my
brother
on
the
box
with
the
master
coachman
our
chief
business
was
to
call
on
milles
and
we
had
indeed
so
little
else
to
do
that
we
were
obliged
to
saunter
about
anywhere
and
go
backwards
and
forwards
as
much
as
possible
to
make
out
the
time
and
keep
ourselves
from
having
two
hours
to
sit
with
the
good
lady
a
most
extraordinary
circumstance
in
a
canterbury
morning
old
toke
came
in
while
we
were
paying
our
visit
i
thought
of
louisa
miss
milles
was
queer
as
usual
and
provided
us
with
plenty
to
laugh
at
she
undertook
in
to
give
us
the
history
of
scudamore
reconciliation
and
then
talked
on
about
it
for
half
an
hour
using
such
odd
expressions
and
so
foolishly
minute
that
i
could
hardly
keep
my
countenance
owing
to
a
difference
of
clocks
the
coachman
did
not
bring
the
carriage
so
soon
as
he
ought
by
half
an
hour
anything
like
a
breach
of
punctuality
was
a
great
offence
and
moore
was
very
angry
which
i
was
rather
glad
of
i
wanted
to
see
him
angry
and
though
he
spoke
to
his
servant
in
a
very
loud
voice
and
with
a
good
deal
of
heat
i
was
happy
to
perceive
that
he
did
not
scold
harriot
at
all
indeed
there
is
nothing
to
object
to
in
his
manners
to
her
and
i
do
believe
that
he
makes
her
or
she
makes
herself
very
happy
they
do
not
spoil
their
boy
george
hatton
called
yesterday
and
i
saw
him
saw
him
for
ten
minutes
sat
in
the
same
room
with
him
heard
him
talk
saw
him
bow
and
was
not
in
raptures
i
discerned
nothing
extraordinary
i
should
speak
of
him
as
a
gentlemanlike
young
man
bien
tout
est
we
are
expecting
the
ladies
of
the
family
this
morning
november
i
will
keep
this
celebrated
birthday
by
writing
to
you
and
as
my
pen
seems
inclined
to
write
large
i
will
put
my
lines
very
close
together
i
had
but
just
time
to
enjoy
your
letter
yesterday
before
edward
and
i
set
off
in
the
chair
for
and
i
allowed
him
to
hear
the
chief
of
it
as
we
went
along
but
now
i
can
not
be
quite
easy
without
staying
a
little
while
with
henry
unless
he
wishes
it
otherwise
his
illness
and
the
dull
time
of
year
together
make
me
feel
that
it
would
be
horrible
of
me
not
to
offer
to
remain
with
him
and
therefore
unless
you
know
of
any
objection
i
wish
you
would
tell
him
with
my
best
love
that
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
spend
ten
days
or
a
fortnight
in
henrietta
if
he
will
accept
me
i
do
not
offer
more
than
a
fortnight
because
i
shall
then
have
been
some
time
from
home
but
it
will
be
a
great
pleasure
to
be
with
him
as
it
always
is
edward
and
i
had
a
delightful
morning
for
our
drive
to
canterbury
i
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
but
the
day
turned
off
before
we
were
ready
and
we
came
home
in
some
rain
and
the
apprehension
of
a
great
deal
it
has
not
done
us
any
harm
however
he
went
to
inspect
the
gaol
as
a
visiting
magistrate
and
took
me
with
him
i
was
gratified
and
went
through
all
the
feelings
which
people
must
go
through
i
think
in
visiting
such
a
building
we
paid
no
other
visits
only
walked
about
snugly
together
and
shopped
i
bought
a
concert
ticket
and
a
sprig
of
flowers
for
my
old
age
what
a
convenient
carriage
henry
is
to
his
friends
in
general
who
has
it
next
i
am
glad
william
going
is
voluntary
and
on
no
worse
grounds
an
inclination
for
the
country
is
a
venial
fault
he
has
more
of
cowper
than
of
johnson
in
him
fonder
of
tame
hares
and
blank
verse
than
of
the
full
tide
of
human
existence
at
charing
cross
oh
i
have
more
of
such
sweet
flattery
from
miss
sharp
she
is
an
excellent
kind
friend
i
am
read
and
admired
in
ireland
too
there
is
a
fletcher
the
wife
of
a
judge
an
old
lady
and
very
good
and
very
clever
who
is
all
curiosity
to
know
about
me
what
i
am
like
and
so
forth
i
am
not
known
to
her
by
however
this
comes
through
carrick
not
through
gore
you
are
quite
out
there
i
do
not
despair
of
having
my
picture
in
the
exhibition
at
last
all
white
and
red
with
my
head
on
one
side
or
perhaps
i
may
marry
young
i
suppose
in
the
meantime
i
shall
owe
dear
henry
a
great
deal
of
money
for
printing
i
hope
fletcher
will
indulge
herself
with
and
november
having
half
an
hour
before
breakfast
very
snug
in
my
own
room
lovely
morning
excellent
fire
fancy
me
i
will
give
you
some
account
of
the
last
two
days
and
yet
what
is
there
to
be
told
i
shall
get
foolishly
minute
unless
i
cut
the
matter
short
we
met
only
the
bretons
at
chilham
castle
besides
a
and
osborne
and
a
miss
lee
staying
in
the
house
and
were
only
fourteen
altogether
my
brother
and
fanny
thought
it
the
pleasantest
party
they
had
ever
known
there
and
i
was
very
well
entertained
by
bits
and
scraps
as
i
must
leave
off
being
young
i
find
many
in
being
a
sort
of
for
i
am
put
on
the
sofa
near
the
fire
and
can
drink
as
much
wine
as
i
like
we
had
music
in
the
evening
fanny
and
miss
wildman
played
and
james
wildman
sat
close
by
and
listened
or
pretended
to
listen
harrison
and
i
found
each
other
out
and
had
a
very
comfortable
little
complimentary
friendly
chat
she
is
a
sweet
woman
still
quite
a
sweet
woman
in
herself
and
so
like
her
sister
i
could
almost
have
thought
i
was
speaking
to
lefroy
she
introduced
me
to
her
daughter
whom
i
think
pretty
but
most
dutifully
inferior
to
mère
i
was
just
introduced
at
last
to
mary
plumptre
but
should
hardly
know
her
again
she
was
delighted
with
however
good
enthusiastic
soul
and
lady
found
me
handsomer
than
she
expected
so
you
see
i
am
not
so
very
bad
as
you
might
think
for
since
i
wrote
last
my
edit
has
stared
me
in
the
face
mary
tells
me
that
eliza
means
to
buy
it
i
wish
she
may
it
can
hardly
depend
upon
any
more
fyfield
estates
i
can
not
help
hoping
that
will
feel
themselves
obliged
to
buy
it
i
shall
not
mind
imagining
it
a
disagreeable
duty
to
them
so
as
they
do
it
mary
heard
before
she
left
home
that
it
was
very
much
admired
at
cheltenham
and
that
it
was
given
to
miss
hamilton
it
is
pleasant
to
have
such
a
respectable
writer
named
i
can
not
tire
i
am
sure
on
this
subject
or
i
would
apologise
what
weather
and
what
news
we
have
enough
to
do
to
admire
them
both
i
hope
you
derive
your
full
share
of
enjoyment
from
each
lady
eliz
hatton
and
annamaria
called
here
this
morning
yes
they
called
but
i
do
not
think
i
can
say
anything
more
about
them
they
came
and
they
sat
and
they
went
excellent
sweetness
of
you
to
send
me
such
a
nice
long
letter
it
made
its
appearance
with
one
from
my
mother
soon
after
i
and
my
impatient
feelings
walked
in
how
glad
i
am
that
i
did
what
i
did
i
was
only
afraid
that
might
think
the
offer
superfluous
but
you
have
set
my
heart
at
ease
tell
henry
that
i
stay
with
him
let
it
be
ever
so
disagreeable
to
him
you
shall
hear
from
me
once
more
some
day
or
other
yours
very
affectionately
j
a
miss
austen
henrietta
street
even
in
the
middle
of
this
large
family
party
jane
was
not
likely
to
forget
the
literary
profession
which
she
had
now
seriously
adopted
indeed
it
was
just
at
this
time
that
the
second
edition
of
and
on
which
she
had
ventured
under
the
advice
of
her
publisher
egerton
appeared
according
to
our
dates
she
was
not
now
actually
engaged
in
regular
composition
for
was
completed
after
june
and
was
not
begun
till
january
we
may
guess
however
that
she
was
either
putting
a
few
humorous
touches
to
norris
and
lady
bertram
or
else
giving
herself
hints
in
advance
for
miss
bates
or
woodhouse
for
we
learn
something
of
her
process
from
an
eyewitness
her
niece
marianne
knight
who
related
her
childish
remembrances
of
her
aunt
not
very
many
years
ago
jane
she
said
sit
very
quietly
at
work
beside
the
fire
in
the
godmersham
library
then
suddenly
burst
out
laughing
jump
up
cross
the
room
to
a
distant
table
with
papers
lying
upon
it
write
something
down
returning
presently
and
sitting
down
quietly
to
her
work
again
she
also
remembered
how
her
aunt
would
take
the
elder
girls
into
an
upstairs
room
and
read
to
them
something
that
produced
peals
of
laughter
to
which
the
little
ones
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
door
listened
thinking
it
very
hard
that
they
should
be
shut
out
from
hearing
what
was
so
delightful
the
laughter
may
have
been
the
result
of
the
second
novel
then
published
for
there
is
an
entry
in
fanny
diary
finished
and
or
it
may
have
been
caused
by
a
first
introduction
to
aunt
norris
and
lady
bertram
happy
indeed
were
those
who
could
hear
their
creator
make
her
characters
as
they
ought
the
dramatic
element
in
her
works
is
so
strong
that
for
complete
enjoyment
on
a
first
acquaintance
it
is
almost
indispensable
that
they
should
be
read
aloud
by
some
person
capable
of
doing
them
justice
she
had
this
power
herself
according
to
the
concurrent
testimony
of
those
who
heard
her
and
she
handed
it
on
to
her
nephew
the
author
of
the
on
november
jane
left
godmersham
with
edward
spent
two
days
with
some
connexions
of
his
at
wrotham
and
reached
london
on
the
in
time
to
dine
with
henry
in
henrietta
street
after
that
she
had
various
plans
but
we
do
not
know
which
she
adopted
and
there
is
nothing
further
to
tell
of
her
movements
until
march
we
know
however
that
was
begun
in
january
and
that
on
march
when
henry
drove
his
sister
up
to
london
spending
a
night
at
cobham
on
the
way
he
was
engaged
in
reading
for
the
first
time
jane
was
of
course
eager
to
communicate
henry
impressions
to
cassandra
henrietta
street
wednesday
march
my
dear
cassandra
you
were
wrong
in
thinking
of
us
at
guildford
last
night
we
were
at
cobham
on
reaching
we
found
that
john
and
his
horses
were
gone
on
we
therefore
did
no
more
there
than
we
did
at
farnham
sit
in
the
carriage
while
fresh
horses
were
put
in
and
proceeded
directly
to
cobham
which
we
reached
by
seven
and
about
eight
were
sitting
down
to
a
very
nice
roast
fowl
we
had
altogether
a
very
good
journey
and
everything
at
cobham
was
comfortable
i
could
not
pay
herington
that
was
the
only
alas
of
the
business
i
shall
therefore
return
his
bill
and
my
mother
that
you
may
try
your
luck
we
did
not
begin
reading
till
bentley
green
approbation
is
hitherto
even
equal
to
my
wishes
he
says
it
is
very
different
from
the
other
two
but
does
not
appear
to
think
it
at
all
inferior
he
has
only
married
i
am
afraid
he
has
gone
through
the
most
entertaining
part
he
took
to
lady
and
most
kindly
and
gives
great
praise
to
the
drawing
of
the
characters
he
understands
them
all
likes
fanny
and
i
think
foresees
how
it
will
all
be
i
finished
the
last
night
and
was
very
much
amused
by
it
i
wonder
james
did
not
like
it
better
it
diverted
me
exceedingly
we
went
to
bed
at
ten
i
was
very
tired
but
slept
to
a
miracle
and
am
lovely
and
at
present
henry
seems
to
have
no
complaint
we
left
cobham
at
eight
stopped
to
bait
and
breakfast
at
kingston
and
were
in
this
house
considerably
before
two
quite
in
the
style
of
knight
nice
smiling
barlowe
met
us
at
the
door
and
in
reply
to
enquiries
after
news
said
that
peace
was
generally
expected
i
have
taken
possession
of
my
bedroom
unpacked
my
bandbox
sent
miss
two
letters
to
the
twopenny
post
been
visited
by
de
bigeon
and
am
now
writing
by
myself
at
the
new
table
in
the
front
room
it
is
snowing
we
had
some
snowstorms
yesterday
and
a
smart
frost
at
night
which
gave
us
a
hard
road
from
cobham
to
kingston
but
as
it
was
then
getting
dirty
and
heavy
henry
had
a
pair
of
leaders
put
on
from
the
latter
place
to
the
bottom
of
sloane
his
own
horses
therefore
can
not
have
had
hard
work
i
watched
for
as
we
drove
through
the
streets
and
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
several
upon
vulgar
heads
and
now
how
do
you
all
do
you
in
particular
after
the
worry
of
yesterday
and
the
day
before
i
hope
martha
had
a
pleasant
visit
again
and
that
you
and
my
mother
could
eat
your
depend
upon
my
thinking
of
the
as
soon
as
i
wake
places
are
secured
at
drury
lane
for
saturday
but
so
great
is
the
rage
for
seeing
kean
that
only
a
third
and
fourth
row
could
be
got
as
it
is
in
a
front
box
however
i
hope
we
shall
do
pretty
well
a
good
play
for
fanny
she
can
not
be
much
affected
i
think
perigord
has
just
been
here
she
tells
me
that
we
owe
her
master
for
the
my
poor
old
muslin
has
never
been
dyed
yet
it
has
been
promised
to
be
done
several
times
what
wicked
people
dyers
are
they
begin
with
dipping
their
own
souls
in
scarlet
sin
it
is
evening
we
have
drank
tea
and
i
have
torn
through
the
third
vol
of
the
i
do
not
think
it
falls
off
it
is
a
delightful
burlesque
particularly
on
the
radcliffe
style
henry
is
going
on
with
he
admires
crawford
i
mean
properly
as
a
clever
pleasant
man
i
tell
you
all
the
good
i
can
as
i
know
how
much
you
will
enjoy
it
we
hear
that
kean
is
more
admired
than
ever
there
are
no
good
places
to
be
got
in
drury
lane
for
the
next
fortnight
but
henry
means
to
secure
some
for
saturday
fortnight
when
you
are
reckoned
upon
give
my
love
to
little
cass
i
hope
she
found
my
bed
comfortable
last
night
i
have
seen
nobody
in
london
yet
with
such
a
long
chin
as
syntax
nor
anybody
quite
so
large
as
gogmagoglicus
saturday
march
do
not
be
angry
with
me
for
beginning
another
letter
to
you
i
have
read
the
mended
my
petticoat
and
have
nothing
else
to
do
getting
out
is
impossible
it
is
a
nasty
day
for
everybody
edward
spirits
will
be
wanting
sunshine
and
here
is
nothing
but
thickness
and
sleet
and
though
these
two
rooms
are
delightfully
warm
i
fancy
it
is
very
cold
abroad
we
were
quite
satisfied
with
kean
i
can
not
imagine
better
acting
but
the
part
was
too
short
and
excepting
him
and
miss
smith
and
did
not
quite
answer
my
expectation
the
parts
were
ill
filled
and
the
play
heavy
we
were
too
much
tired
to
stay
for
the
whole
of
which
has
three
acts
there
is
a
great
deal
of
finery
and
dancing
in
it
but
i
think
little
merit
elliston
was
but
it
is
a
solemn
sort
of
part
not
at
all
calculated
for
his
powers
there
was
nothing
of
the
elliston
about
him
i
might
not
have
known
him
but
for
his
voice
henry
has
this
moment
said
that
he
likes
my
better
and
better
he
is
in
the
third
volume
i
believe
he
has
changed
his
mind
as
to
foreseeing
the
end
he
said
yesterday
at
least
that
he
defied
anybody
to
say
whether
would
be
reformed
or
would
forget
fanny
in
a
fortnight
i
shall
like
to
see
kean
again
excessively
and
to
see
him
with
you
too
it
appeared
to
me
as
if
there
were
no
fault
in
him
anywhere
and
in
his
scene
with
there
was
exquisite
acting
you
can
not
think
how
much
my
ermine
tippet
is
admired
both
by
father
and
daughter
it
was
a
noble
gift
perhaps
you
have
not
heard
that
edward
has
a
good
chance
of
escaping
his
lawsuit
his
opponent
under
the
terms
of
agreement
are
not
quite
settled
we
are
to
see
devil
to
i
expect
to
be
very
much
amused
excepting
miss
stephens
i
daresay
will
be
very
tiresome
well
hampson
dined
here
and
all
that
i
was
very
tired
of
highly
amused
with
the
farce
and
in
an
inferior
way
with
the
pantomime
that
followed
plumptre
joined
in
the
latter
part
of
the
evening
walked
home
with
us
ate
some
soup
and
is
very
earnest
for
our
going
to
covent
garden
again
to
see
miss
stephens
in
the
he
is
to
try
for
a
box
i
do
not
particularly
wish
him
to
succeed
i
have
had
enough
for
the
present
henry
dines
with
spencer
wednesday
march
well
we
went
to
the
play
again
last
night
and
as
we
were
out
a
great
part
of
the
morning
too
shopping
and
seeing
the
indian
jugglers
i
am
very
glad
to
be
quiet
now
till
dressing
time
we
are
to
dine
at
the
tilsons
and
at
spencer
we
had
not
done
breakfast
yesterday
when
plumptre
appeared
to
say
that
he
had
secured
a
box
henry
asked
him
to
dine
here
which
i
fancy
he
was
very
happy
to
do
and
so
at
five
we
four
sat
down
to
table
together
while
the
master
of
the
house
was
preparing
for
going
out
himself
the
is
a
musical
thing
in
three
acts
and
as
edward
was
steady
in
not
staying
for
anything
more
we
were
at
home
before
ten
fanny
and
are
delighted
with
miss
s
tephens
and
her
merit
in
singing
is
i
dare
say
very
great
that
she
gave
no
pleasure
is
no
reflection
upon
her
nor
i
hope
upon
myself
being
what
nature
made
me
on
that
article
all
that
i
am
sensible
of
in
miss
is
a
pleasing
person
and
no
skill
in
acting
we
had
mathews
liston
and
emery
of
course
some
amusement
our
friends
were
off
before
eight
this
morning
and
had
the
prospect
of
a
heavy
cold
journey
before
them
i
think
they
both
liked
their
visit
very
much
i
am
sure
fanny
did
henry
sees
decided
attachment
between
her
and
his
new
acquaintance
henry
has
finished
and
his
approbation
has
not
lessened
he
found
the
last
half
of
the
last
volume
on
friday
we
are
to
be
snug
with
only
barlowe
and
an
evening
of
business
i
am
so
pleased
that
the
mead
is
brewed
love
to
all
i
have
written
to
hill
and
care
for
nobody
yours
affectionately
austen
henry
must
have
read
from
a
proof
copy
for
was
not
yet
published
though
on
the
eve
of
being
so
it
was
announced
in
the
on
may
and
we
shall
see
from
the
first
letter
in
the
next
chapter
that
the
cookes
had
already
been
reading
it
before
june
it
was
probably
a
small
issue
but
whatever
the
size
may
have
been
it
was
entirely
sold
out
in
the
autumn
the
author
broke
new
ground
in
this
work
which
it
should
be
remembered
was
the
first
dating
wholly
from
her
more
mature
chawton
period
though
her
novels
were
all
of
one
type
she
had
a
remarkable
faculty
for
creating
an
atmosphere
differing
more
or
less
in
each
book
and
an
excellent
instance
of
this
faculty
is
afforded
by
the
decorous
though
somewhat
cold
dignity
of
sir
thomas
bertram
household
in
this
household
fanny
price
grows
up
thoroughly
appreciating
its
orderliness
but
saved
by
edmund
affection
and
her
own
warmhearted
simplicity
from
catching
the
infection
of
its
coldness
she
required
however
an
experience
of
the
discomforts
and
vulgarity
of
portsmouth
to
enable
her
to
value
to
the
full
the
home
which
she
had
left
in
the
first
volume
she
had
been
too
much
of
a
cinderella
to
take
her
proper
position
in
the
family
party
and
it
was
a
real
stroke
of
art
to
enhance
the
dignity
of
the
heroine
through
the
courtship
of
a
rich
and
clever
man
of
the
world
a
small
point
worth
noticing
in
the
third
volume
is
the
manner
in
which
when
the
horrible
truth
breaks
in
upon
fanny
and
upon
the
reader
the
tension
is
relaxed
by
price
commonplace
remarks
about
the
carpet
probably
most
readers
will
look
upon
the
theatricals
and
the
portsmouth
episode
as
the
most
brilliant
parts
of
the
book
but
the
writing
throughout
is
full
of
point
and
the
three
sisters
lady
bertram
norris
and
price
are
all
productions
of
the
author
most
delicately
barbed
satire
norris
indeed
is
an
instance
of
her
complex
characters
so
justly
praised
by
macaulay
one
thinks
of
her
mainly
as
parsimonious
but
her
parsimony
would
be
worth
much
less
than
it
is
if
it
were
not
set
off
by
her
servility
to
sir
thomas
her
brutality
to
fanny
and
her
undisciplined
fondness
for
her
other
nieces
lady
bertram
is
formed
for
the
enjoyment
of
all
her
readers
and
a
pale
example
of
what
she
might
have
become
under
less
propitious
circumstances
is
given
by
price
norris
we
are
told
would
have
done
much
better
than
price
in
her
position
it
must
have
given
jane
austen
great
pleasure
to
make
this
remark
none
of
her
bad
characters
except
possibly
elizabeth
elliot
were
quite
inhuman
to
her
and
to
have
found
a
situation
in
which
norris
might
have
shone
would
be
a
real
satisfaction
one
more
remark
may
be
made
on
it
affords
what
perhaps
is
the
only
probable
instance
in
these
books
of
a
portrait
drawn
from
life
she
must
one
would
think
have
had
in
her
mind
her
brother
charles
as
he
had
been
twelve
or
fourteen
years
earlier
when
she
drew
so
charming
a
sketch
of
a
young
sailor
in
william
price
we
must
not
forget
however
the
author
strong
denial
of
depicting
individuals
and
her
declaration
that
she
was
too
proud
of
her
gentlemen
admit
that
they
were
only
or
colonel
b
nor
yet
her
modest
confession
when
speaking
of
two
of
her
favourites
edmund
bertram
and
knightley
that
she
was
aware
they
were
far
from
what
i
know
english
gentlemen
often
are
jane
austen
may
perhaps
enjoy
the
distinction
of
having
added
words
or
expressions
to
colloquial
english
the
name
is
almost
established
as
the
description
of
a
letter
of
thanks
after
a
visit

we
have
heard
of
a
highly
intelligent
family

vol

kean
had
made
his

appearance
at

on

taken

edward
knight
and
his
daughter
fanny
were
to
arrive

day

no
doubt
there
were
other
cases
in

particular

were
taken
from

chapter
xvii
the
last
letter
but
one
of
the
foregoing
chapter
contains
two
sentences
mentioning
the
writer
brother
knight
which
will
help
us
to
carry
on
our
story
writing
on
march
jane
says
is
a
nasty
day
for
everybody
edward
spirits
will
be
wanting
sunshine
and
here
is
nothing
but
thickness
and
sleet
and
towards
the
conclusion
of
the
same
letter
we
find
the
following
you
have
not
heard
that
edward
has
a
good
chance
of
escaping
his
lawsuit
his
opponent
knocks
under
the
terms
of
agreement
are
not
quite
settled
there
can
we
think
be
little
doubt
that
both
passages
the
depressed
and
the
hopeful
refer
to
a
claim
over
edward
hampshire
property
made
by
some
of
the
of
the
former
knight
family
whom
the
brodnaxes
of
godmersham
had
succeeded
unfortunately
the
cheerful
forecast
contained
in
the
second
passage
did
not
prove
to
be
in
accordance
with
the
facts
the
lawsuit
hung
on
for
three
years
and
was
then
compromised
by
knight
paying
a
large
sum
of
money
perhaps
the
claim
also
had
its
influence
in
producing
the
one
unflattering
estimate
of
jane
which
we
shall
have
to
lay
before
the
reader
miss
mitford
was
a
convinced
but
apparently
a
reluctant
admirer
of
her
genius
and
she
dwells
without
disguise
on
what
she
considers
the
want
of
taste
in
and
though
even
here
she
adds
that
miss
austen
nothing
but
the
of
the
female
character
to
be
a
perfect
novel
writer
in
another
letter
she
refers
to
her
mother
unfavourable
reminiscences
of
jane
austen
as
a
although
mitford
remark
must
as
we
have
already
pointed
out
have
been
based
on
an
entire
misrepresentation
owing
to
jane
youthful
age
at
the
time
when
that
lady
could
have
known
her
she
proceeds
thus
a
friend
of
mine
who
visits
her
now
says
that
she
has
stiffened
into
the
most
perpendicular
precise
taciturn
piece
of
that
ever
existed
and
that
till
and
showed
what
a
precious
gem
was
hidden
in
that
unbending
case
she
was
no
more
regarded
in
society
than
a
poker
or
a
or
any
other
thin
upright
piece
of
wood
or
iron
that
fills
the
corner
in
peace
and
quietness
the
case
is
very
different
now
she
is
still
a
poker
but
a
poker
of
whom
every
one
is
afraid
it
must
be
confessed
that
this
silent
observation
from
such
an
observer
is
rather
formidable
most
writers
are
chatterers
neither
very
wise
nor
very
witty
but
nine
times
out
of
ten
at
least
in
the
few
that
i
have
known
unaffected
and
pleasant
and
quite
removing
by
their
conversation
any
fear
that
may
have
been
excited
by
their
works
but
a
wit
a
delineator
of
character
who
does
not
talk
is
terrific
indeed
miss
mitford
has
however
the
candour
to
add
a
qualification
which
diminishes
the
force
of
her
earlier
remarks
and
bears
upon
our
present
subject
she
says
after
all
i
do
not
know
that
i
can
quite
vouch
for
this
account
though
the
friend
from
whom
i
received
it
is
truth
itself
but
her
family
connexions
must
render
her
disagreeable
to
miss
austen
since
she
is
the
of
a
gentleman
who
is
at
law
with
miss
a
brother
for
the
greater
part
of
his
fortune
you
must
have
remarked
how
much
her
stories
hinge
upon
entailed
estates
doubtless
she
has
learnt
to
dislike
entails
her
brother
was
adopted
by
a
knight
who
left
him
his
name
and
two
much
better
legacies
in
an
estate
of
five
thousand
a
year
in
kent
and
another
of
nearly
double
the
value
in
hampshire
but
it
seems
he
forgot
some
ceremony
passing
a
fine
i
think
they
call
it
with
regard
to
the
hampshire
property
which
baverstock
has
claimed
in
right
of
his
mother
together
with
the
mesne
rents
and
is
likely
to
be
successful
miss
mitford
indeed
could
hardly
have
done
less
after
repeating
this
somewhat
spiteful
gossip
than
mention
the
hostile
quarter
from
which
it
arose
we
have
considered
it
right
to
quote
part
of
it
as
the
writer
is
an
author
of
some
note
but
we
venture
to
think
that
those
readers
who
have
accompanied
us
so
far
will
believe
that
jane
was
guilty
of
nothing
worse
than
being
shy
and
talking
but
little
among
strangers
and
that
such
strangers
as
knew
something
of
her
literary
ability
believed
but
were
quite
wrong
in
believing
that
she
was
taking
stock
of
their
peculiarities
with
a
view
to
introducing
them
into
her
next
novel
jane
had
now
completed
the
first
of
three
visits
which
she
was
to
pay
to
henry
this
year
and
cassandra
was
in
london
in
her
place
while
the
godmersham
party
were
spending
two
months
at
chawton
the
two
following
letters
were
written
by
jane
from
chawton
in
anticipation
of
a
visit
to
the
cookes
at
bookham
incidentally
cooke
remark
quoted
in
the
first
shows
that
was
already
published
we
must
not
forget
however
that
its
author
had
been
since
january
deep
in
the
composition
of
and
she
would
be
sure
to
use
a
visit
to
the
neighbourhood
of
leatherhead
and
box
hill
to
verify
geographical
and
other
details
for
her
new
work
since
her
fame
was
fully
established
there
have
been
many
attempts
to
identify
the
locality
of
highbury
is
a
school
of
serious
students
who
place
it
at
esher
another
band
of
enthusiasts
support
dorking
but
lucas
in
his
introduction
to
a
recent
edition
of
the
novel
prefers
the
claim
of
leatherhead
which
he
says
is
rightly
placed
as
regards
london
and
kingston
and
not
far
wrong
as
regards
box
hill
near
leatherhead
is
a
house
called
and
in
the
vestry
of
the
parish
paid
their
thanks
the
most
respectful
manner
to
knightley
who
had
remodelled
the
pulpit
and
of
the
church
cobham
should
be
mentioned
as
another
possible
alternative
as
the
distances
from
london
richmond
kingston
and
box
hill
suit
well
but
the
most
probable
supposition
of
all
is
that
the
author
purposely
avoided
identifying
it
with
any
one
village
while
sufficiently
defining
its
position
in
the
county
of
surrey

tuesday
june
my
dearest
cassandra
fanny
takes
my
mother
to
alton
this
morning
which
gives
me
an
opportunity
of
sending
you
a
few
lines
without
any
other
trouble
than
that
of
writing
them
this
is
a
delightful
day
in
the
country
and
i
hope
not
much
too
hot
for
town
well
you
had
a
good
journey
i
trust
and
all
that
and
not
rain
enough
to
spoil
your
bonnet
it
appeared
so
likely
to
be
a
wet
evening
that
i
went
up
to
the
gt
house
between
three
and
four
and
dawdled
away
an
hour
very
comfortably
though
edwd
was
not
very
brisk
the
air
was
clearer
in
the
evening
and
he
was
better
we
all
five
walked
together
into
the
kitchen
garden
and
along
the
gosport
road
and
they
drank
tea
with
us
the
only
letter
is
from
cooke
to
me
they
do
not
leave
home
till
july
and
want
me
to
come
to
them
according
to
my
promise
and
after
considering
everything
i
have
resolved
on
going
in
addition
to
their
standing
claims
on
me
they
admire
exceedingly
cooke
says
is
the
most
sensible
novel
he
ever
read
and
the
manner
in
which
i
treat
the
clergy
delights
them
very
much
altogether
i
must
go
and
i
want
you
to
join
me
there
when
your
visit
in
henrietta
is
over
put
this
into
your
capacious
head
take
care
of
yourself
and
do
not
be
trampled
to
death
in
running
after
the
emperor
the
report
in
alton
yesterday
was
that
they
would
certainly
travel
this
road
either
to
or
from
portsmouth
i
long
to
know
what
this
bow
of
the
prince
will
produce
thursday
june
i
heard
yesterday
from
frank
when
he
began
his
letter
he
hoped
to
be
here
on
monday
but
before
it
was
ended
he
had
been
told
that
the
naval
review
would
not
take
place
till
friday
which
would
probably
occasion
him
some
delay
as
he
can
not
get
some
necessary
business
of
his
own
attended
to
while
portsmouth
is
in
such
a
bustle
i
hope
fanny
has
seen
the
emperor
and
then
i
may
fairly
wish
them
all
away
i
go
and
hope
for
some
delays
and
adventures
henry
at
white
oh
what
a
henry
i
do
not
know
what
to
wish
as
to
miss
so
i
will
hold
my
tongue
and
my
wishes
we
have
called
upon
miss
dusantoy
and
miss
papillon
and
been
very
pretty
miss
has
a
great
idea
of
being

and
her
youngest

is

very
affectionately
austen
jane
visit
to
bookham
began
on
june
as
soon
as
the
knights
had
left
chawton
she
was
to
be
away
for
more
than
a
fortnight
and
must
have
been
at
chawton
again
for
a
month
till
the
middle
of
august
when
she
once
more
went
to
join
henry
in
london
on
this
occasion
she
had
no
rich
brother
to
take
her
in
his
carriage
and
was
forced
to
come
by
yalden
somewhat
crowded
coach
four
inside
and
fifteen
on
the
top
henry
had
moved
between
june
and
august
finding
a
house
in
his
old
neighbourhood
at
hans
place
next
to
him
but
separated
from
him
by
the
entrance
to
the
pavilion
now
the
road
leading
to
pont
street
at
no
was
the
quentins
celebrated
school
at
which
miss
mitford
had
been
a
pupil
as
well
as
miss
landon
and
lady
caroline
lamb
three
doors
off
at
no
lived
henry
partner
tilson
with
whom
it
was
possible
to
converse
across
the
intermediate
gardens
hans
place
tuesday
morning
august
my
dear
cassandra
i
had
a
very
good
journey
not
crowded
two
of
the
three
taken
up
at
bentley
being
children
the
others
of
a
reasonable
size
and
they
were
all
very
quiet
and
civil
we
were
late
in
london
from
being
a
great
load
and
from
changing
coaches
at
farnham
it
was
nearly
four
i
believe
when
we
reached
sloane
street
henry
himself
met
me
and
as
soon
as
my
trunk
and
basket
could
be
routed
out
from
all
the
other
trunks
and
baskets
in
the
world
we
were
on
our
way
to
hans
place
in
the
luxury
of
a
nice
large
cool
dirty
hackney
coach
there
were
four
in
the
kitchen
part
of
yalden
and
i
was
told
fifteen
at
top
among
them
percy
benn
we
met
in
the
same
room
at
egham
but
poor
percy
was
not
in
his
usual
spirits
he
would
be
more
chatty
i
dare
say
in
his
way
woolwich
we
took
up
a
young
gibson
at
holybourn
and
in
short
everybody
either
come
up
by
yalden
yesterday
or
wanted
to
come
up
it
put
me
in
mind
of
my
own
coach
between
edinburgh
and
stirling
it
is
a
delightful
place
more
than
answers
my
expectation
having
got
rid
of
my
unreasonable
ideas
i
find
more
space
and
comfort
in
the
rooms
than
i
had
supposed
and
the
garden
is
quite
a
love
i
am
in
the
front
attic
which
is
the
bedchamber
to
be
preferred
i
got
the
willow
yesterday
as
henry
was
not
quite
ready
when
i
reached
a
st
i
saw
hampson
there
for
a
moment
he
dines
here
and
proposed
bringing
his
son
so
i
must
submit
to
seeing
george
hampson
though
i
had
hoped
to
go
through
life
without
it
it
was
one
of
my
vanities
like
your
not
reading
is
not
this
all
that
can
have
happened
or
been
arranged
not
quite
henry
wants
me
to
see
more
of
his
hanwell
favourite
and
has
written
to
invite
her
to
spend
a
day
or
two
here
with
me
his
scheme
is
to
fetch
her
on
saturday
i
am
more
and
more
convinced
that
he
will
marry
again
soon
and
like
the
idea
of
better
than
of
anybody
else
at
hand
yours
very
truly
and
affectionately
jane
miss
austen
chawton
by
favour
of
gray
all
through
this
year
and
the
early
part
of
the
next
begun
january
finished
march
was
assiduously
worked
at
although
polished
to
the
highest
degree
it
was
more
quickly
composed
than
any
previous
work
and
gave
evidence
of
a
practised
hand
it
was
also
the
most
of
all
her
novels
carrying
out
most
completely
her
idea
of
what
was
fitted
to
her
tastes
and
capacities
she
enjoyed
having
a
heroine
no
one
would
like
but
herself
and
working
on
or
four
families
in
a
country
village
appeals
therefore
more
exclusively
than
any
of
the
others
to
an
inner
circle
of
admirers
but
such
admirers
may
possibly
place
it
at
the
head
of
her
compositions
there
are
no
stirring
incidents
there
is
no
change
of
scene
the
heroine
whose
society
we
enjoy
throughout
never
sleeps
away
from
home
and
even
there
sees
only
so
much
company
as
an
invalid
father
can
welcome
no
character
in
the
book
is
ill
no
one
is
ruined
there
is
no
villain
and
no
paragon
on
the
other
hand
the
plot
is
admirably
contrived
and
never
halts
while
the
mysteries
exclusively
mysteries
of
courtship
and
love
are
excellently
maintained
emma
never
expresses
any
opinion
which
is
thoroughly
sound
and
seldom
makes
any
forecast
which
is
not
belied
by
the
event
yet
we
always
recognise
her
acuteness
and
she
by
degrees
obtains
our
sympathy
the
book
also
illustrates
to
the
highest
degree
the
author
power
of
drawing
humorous
characters
miss
bates
woodhouse
and
elton
in
the
first
class
and
harriet
smith
in
the
second
and
the
humour
is
always
essential
to
the
delineation
of
character
it
is
never
an
excrescence
it
also
depends
more
on
what
is
said
than
on
any
tricks
of
speech
there
are
no
and
every
one
speaks
practically
the
same
excellent
english
besides
this
also
gives
a
very
good
instance
of
the
author
habit
of
building
up
her
characters
almost
entirely
without
formal
description
and
leaving
analysis
to
her
readers
her
custom
of
following
her
creations
outside
the
printed
pages
enables
us
to
say
that
the
word
swept
aside
unread
by
jane
fairfax
was
and
that
the
knightleys
exclusion
from
donwell
was
ended
by
the
death
of
woodhouse
in
two
years
time
according
to
a
less
tradition
jane
fairfax
survived
her
elevation
only
nine
or
ten
years
whether
the
john
knightleys
afterwards
settled
at
hartfield
and
whether
frank
churchill
married
again
may
be
legitimate
subjects
for
speculation
meanwhile
was
selling
well
and
the
idea
of
a
second
edition
began
to
be
mooted
writing
from
chawton
to
her
niece
fanny
on
another
subject
november
she
tells
her
that
the
first
edition
is
all
sold
and
adds
your
uncle
henry
is
rather
wanting
me
to
come
to
town
to
settle
about
a
second
edition
but
as
i
could
not
very
conveniently
leave
home
now
i
have
written
him
my
will
and
pleasure
and
unless
he
still
urges
it
shall
not
go
i
am
very
greedy
and
want
to
make
the
most
of
it
but
as
you
are
much
above
caring
about
money
i
shall
not
plague
you
with
any
particulars
the
pleasures
of
vanity
are
more
within
your
comprehension
and
you
will
enter
into
mine
at
receiving
the
which
every
now
and
then
comes
to
me
through
some
channel
or
other
she
did
however
leave
home
and
our
next
extract
is
from
a
letter
written
to
fanny
from
hans
place
and
dated
november
thank
you
but
it
is
not
yet
settled
whether
i
hazard
a
second
edition
we
are
to
see
egerton
when
it
will
probably
be
determined
people
are
more
ready
to
borrow
and
praise
than
to
buy
which
i
can
not
wonder
at
but
though
i
like
praise
as
well
as
anybody
i
like
what
edward
calls
too
apparently
egerton
did
not
fancy
taking
the
risk
for
there
was
no
second
edition
until
when
it
appeared
from
the
publishing
house
of
murray
jane
stay
in
london
was
a
short
one
but
it
included
a
visit
to
her
niece
anna
who
had
lately
been
married
to
ben
lefroy
and
who
was
living
for
the
time
at
hendon
early
in
december
jane
returned
home
and
three
weeks
later
she
and
cassandra
set
out
for
a
couple
of
visits
one
for
a
week
to
heathcote
and
miss
bigg
in
winchester
the
other
of
longer
duration
to
their
brother
at
steventon
then
the
curtain
is
rung
down
once
more
not
to
be
raised
till
the
end
of
september
during
this
quiet
time
was
prepared
for
the
press
and
it
was
no
doubt
in
connexion
with
its
publication
that
she
went
to
hans
place
on
october
for
a
visit
which
proved
to
be
much
longer
and
more
eventful
than
the
last
for
some
reason
that
we
are
unable
to
explain
jane
now
forsook
her
former
publisher
egerton
and
put
her
interests
in
the
charge
of
the
historic
house
of
murray
she
travelled
up
once
more
in
the
company
of
henry
who
had
been
paying
his
mother
and
sisters
a
short
visit
at
the
cottage
the
prolongation
of
jane
stay
in
london
to
more
than
a
couple
of
months
was
caused
by
henry
dangerous
illness
she
gives
the
news
in
a
letter
written
to
cassandra
and
dated
tuesday
october
what
weather
we
have
what
shall
we
do
about
it
the
october
and
summer
still
henry
is
not
quite
well
a
bilious
attack
with
fever
he
came
back
early
from
henrietta
street
yesterday
and
went
to
bed
the
comical
consequence
of
which
was
that
seymour
and
i
dined
together
he
is
calomeling
and
therefore
in
a
way
to
be
better
and
i
hope
may
be
well
henry
illness
is
much
more
serious
than
i
expected
he
has
been
in
bed
since
three
on
monday
it
is
a
fever
something
bilious
but
chiefly
inflammatory
i
am
not
alarmed
but
i
have
determined
to
send
this
letter
by
the
post
that
you
may
know
how
things
are
going
on
there
is
no
chance
of
his
being
able
to
leave
town
on
saturday
i
asked
haden
that
question
is
the
apothecary
from
the
corner
of
sloane
street
successor
to
smith
a
very
young
man
said
to
be
clever
and
he
is
certainly
very
attentive
and
appears
hitherto
to
have
understood
the
complaint
as
for
myself
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
return
as
soon
as
i
can
tuesday
is
in
my
brain
but
you
will
feel
the
uncertainty
of
it
you
must
fancy
henry
in
the
backroom
upstairs
and
i
am
generally
there
also
working
or
writing
even
in
illness
the
interests
of
were
not
neglected
and
a
day
or
two
later
henry
was
able
to
dictate
the
following
letter
to
murray
dear
sir
severe
illness
has
confined
me
to
my
bed
ever
since
i
received
yours
of
e
i
can
not
yet
hold
a
pen
and
employ
an
amanuensis
the
politeness
and
perspicuity
of
your
letter
equally
claim
my
earliest
exertion
your
official
opinion
of
the
merits
of
is
very
valuable
and
satisfactory
though
i
venture
to
differ
occasionally
from
your
critique
yet
i
assure
you
the
quantum
of
your
commendation
rather
exceeds
than
falls
short
of
the
author
expectation
and
my
own
the
terms
you
offer
are
so
very
inferior
to
what
we
had
expected
that
i
am
apprehensive
of
having
made
some
great
error
in
my
arithmetical
calculation
on
the
subject
of
the
expence
and
profit
of
publishing
you
must
be
much
better
informed
than
i
am
but
documents
in
my
possession
appear
to
prove
that
the
sum
offered
by
you
for
the
copyright
of
and
and
is
not
equal
to
the
money
which
my
sister
has
actually
cleared
by
one
very
moderate
edition
of
you
yourself
expressed
astonishment
that
so
small
an
edition
of
such
a
work
should
have
been
sent
into
the
world
and
a
still
smaller
one
of
and
henry
however
became
so
alarmingly
ill
that
on
october
jane
dispatched
expresses
to
her
brothers
and
sister
summoning
them
to
london
knight
left
godmersham
for
town
on
the
but
owing
to
a
delay
in
the
delivery
of
the
letter
james
austen
did
not
receive
his
till
the
he
rode
to
chawton
that
evening
and
the
next
day
he
and
cassandra
arrived
in
london
for
a
time
henry
life
was
in
imminent
danger
but
after
a
week
anxiety
he
was
so
far
on
the
road
to
recovery
that
his
two
brothers
were
able
to
return
home
leaving
jane
and
cassandra
in
charge
it
was
owing
to
jane
untiring
exertions
at
this
time
that
her
health
began
to
suffer
one
other
consequence
too
but
of
a
less
tragical
kind
was
due
to
henry
illness
the
physician
that
attended
him
supplementing
no
doubt
haden
was
one
of
the
prince
physicians
and
he
either
knowing
or
hearing
for
it
was
now
an
open
secret
that
jane
austen
was
the
author
of
and
informed
her
that
the
prince
greatly
admired
her
novels
he
read
them
often
and
kept
a
set
in
every
one
of
his
residences
that
he
himself
had
thought
it
right
to
inform
his
royal
highness
that
miss
austen
was
staying
in
london
the
prince
did
not
so
far
condescend
as
to
desire
to
see
miss
austen
in
person
but
he
instructed
his
librarian
clarke
to
wait
upon
her
and
show
her
any
civility
in
his
power
the
result
was
that
on
november
jane
was
shown
over
the
library
and
other
apartments
at
carlton
house
and
in
the
course
of
the
visit
clarke
announced
that
if
miss
austen
had
any
other
novel
forthcoming
she
was
at
liberty
to
dedicate
it
to
the
prince
we
can
not
tell
what
may
have
been
the
exact
amount
of
pleasure
given
to
jane
by
this
piece
of
information
as
cassandra
was
at
that
time
also
in
hans
place
and
there
is
therefore
no
letter
of
jane
to
her
on
the
subject
but
at
any
rate
jane
was
loyal
enough
to
wish
to
do
what
was
right
and
proper
in
the
circumstances
consequently
on
november
we
find
her
writing
to
clarke
as
follows
sir
i
must
take
the
liberty
of
asking
you
a
question
among
the
many
flattering
attentions
which
i
received
from
you
at
carlton
house
on
monday
last
was
the
information
of
my
being
at
liberty
to
dedicate
any
future
work
to
his
royal
highness
the
prince
regent
without
the
necessity
of
any
solicitation
on
my
part
such
at
least
i
believed
to
be
your
words
but
as
i
am
very
anxious
to
be
quite
certain
of
what
was
intended
i
entreat
you
to
have
the
goodness
to
inform
me
how
such
a
permission
is
to
be
understood
and
whether
it
is
incumbent
on
me
to
show
my
sense
of
the
honour
by
inscribing
the
work
now
in
the
press
to
his
royal
highness
i
should
be
equally
concerned
to
appear
either
presumptuous
or
ungrateful
to
which
clarke
replied
carlton
house
november
dear
madam
it
is
certainly
not
on
you
to
dedicate
your
work
now
in
the
press
to
his
royal
highness
but
if
you
wish
to
do
the
regent
that
honour
either
now
or
at
any
future
period
i
am
happy
to
send
you
that
permission
which
need
not
require
any
more
trouble
or
solicitation
on
your
part
your
late
works
madam
and
in
particular
reflect
the
highest
honour
on
your
genius
and
your
principles
in
every
new
work
your
mind
seems
to
increase
its
energy
and
power
of
discrimination
the
regent
has
read
and
admired
all
your
publications
accept
my
sincere
thanks
for
the
pleasure
your
volumes
have
given
me
in
the
perusal
of
them
i
felt
a
great
inclination
to
write
and
say
so
and
i
also
dear
madam
wished
to
be
allowed
to
ask
you
to
delineate
in
some
future
work
the
habits
of
life
and
character
and
enthusiasm
of
a
clergyman
who
should
pass
his
time
between
the
metropolis
and
the
country
who
should
be
something
like
beattie
minstrel
silent
when
glad
affectionate
tho
shy
and
now
his
look
was
most
demurely
sad
and
now
he
laughed
aloud
yet
none
knew
why
neither
goldsmith
nor
la
fontaine
in
his
de
have
in
my
mind
quite
delineated
an
english
clergyman
at
least
of
the
present
day
fond
of
and
entirely
engaged
in
literature
no
man
enemy
but
his
own
pray
dear
madam
think
of
these
things
believe
me
at
all
times
with
sincerity
and
respect
your
faithful
and
obliged
servant
clarke
i
am
going
for
about
three
weeks
to
henry
streatfeild
chiddingstone
sevenoaks
but
hope
on
my
return
to
town
to
have
the
honour
of
seeing
you
again
on
november
henry
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
address
a
letter
to
john
murray
on
his
sister
behalf
this
was
followed
by
a
letter
from
herself
on
november
hans
place
thursday
november
sir
my
brother
note
last
monday
has
been
so
fruitless
that
i
am
afraid
there
can
be
but
little
chance
of
my
writing
to
any
good
effect
but
yet
i
am
so
very
much
disappointed
and
vexed
by
the
delays
of
the
printers
that
i
can
not
help
begging
to
know
whether
there
is
no
hope
of
their
being
quickened
instead
of
the
work
being
ready
by
the
end
of
the
present
month
it
will
hardly
at
the
rate
we
now
proceed
be
finished
by
the
end
of
the
next
and
as
i
expect
to
leave
london
early
in
december
it
is
of
consequence
that
no
more
time
should
be
lost
is
it
likely
that
the
printers
will
be
influenced
to
greater
dispatch
and
punctuality
by
knowing
that
the
work
is
to
be
dedicated
by
permission
to
the
prince
regent
if
you
can
make
that
circumstance
operate
i
shall
be
very
glad
my
brother
returns
with
many
thanks
for
the
loan
of
it
we
have
heard
much
of
scott
account
of
paris
if
it
be
not
incompatible
with
other
arrangements
would
you
favour
us
with
it
supposing
you
have
any
set
already
opened
you
may
depend
upon
its
being
in
careful
hands
i
remain
sir
your
humble
austen
meanwhile
as
henry
was
mending
his
brother
edward
who
had
brought
his
daughter
fanny
up
to
town
left
her
as
a
companion
to
her
aunt
jane
and
escorted
cassandra
to
chawton
hans
place
friday
november
my
dearest
cassandra
i
have
the
pleasure
of
sending
you
a
much
better
account
of
which
i
know
will
be
a
great
delight
to
you
i
wrote
to
murray
yesterday
myself
and
henry
wrote
at
the
same
time
to
roworth
before
the
notes
were
out
of
the
house
i
received
three
sheets
and
an
apology
from
we
sent
the
notes
however
and
i
had
a
most
civil
one
in
reply
from
he
is
so
very
polite
indeed
that
it
is
quite
overcoming
the
printers
have
been
waiting
for
paper
the
blame
is
thrown
upon
the
stationer
but
he
gives
his
word
that
i
shall
have
no
farther
cause
for
dissatisfaction
he
has
lent
us
and
and
says
that
any
book
of
his
will
always
be
at
service
in
short
i
am
soothed
and
complimented
into
tolerable
comfort
haden
is
to
dine
with
us
there
is
happiness
we
really
grow
so
fond
of
haden
that
i
do
not
know
what
to
expect
he
and
tilson
and
philips
made
up
our
circle
of
wits
last
night
fanny
played
and
he
sat
and
listened
and
suggested
improvements
till
richard
came
in
to
tell
him
that
doctor
was
waiting
for
him
at
captn
blake
and
then
he
was
off
with
a
speed
that
you
can
imagine
he
never
does
appear
in
the
least
above
his
profession
or
out
of
humour
with
it
or
i
should
think
poor

blake
whoever
he
is
in
a
very
bad
way
yours
very
affectionately
austen
i
have
been
listening
to
dreadful
insanity
it
is
haden
firm
belief
that
a
person
musical
is
fit
for
every
sort
of
wickedness
i
ventured
to
assert
a
little
on
the
other
side
but
wished
the
cause
in
abler
hands
hans
place
sunday
november
i
mention
the
in
my
note
to
murray
it
brought
me
a
fine
compliment
in
return
whether
it
has
done
any
other
good
i
do
not
know
but
henry
thought
it
worth
trying
the
printers
continue
to
supply
me
very
well
i
am
advanced
in
vol
iii
to
my
upon
which
peculiar
style
of
spelling
there
is
a
modest
query
in
the
margin
i
will
not
forget
arrowroot
i
hope
you
have
told
martha
of
my
first
resolution
of
letting
nobody
know
that
i
dedicate
for
fear
of
being
obliged
to
do
it
and
that
she
is
thoroughly
convinced
of
my
being
influenced
now
by
nothing
but
the
most
mercenary
motives
then
came
dinner
and
haden
who
brought
good
manners
and
clever
conversation
from
to
the
harp
at
and
miss
arrived
and
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
the
was
thus
arranged
on
the
sofa
side
the
two
ladies
henry
and
myself
making
the
best
of
it
on
the
opposite
side
fanny
and
haden
in
two
chairs
i
at
least
they
had
chairs
talking
together
uninterruptedly
fancy
the
scene
and
what
is
to
be
fancied
next
why
that
dines
here
again
we
are
to
have
barlow
is
reading
for
the
first
time
and
prefers
it
to
and
fanny
has
heard
all
that
i
have
said
to
you
about
herself
and
thank
you
very
much
for
the
sight
of
dearest
charles
letter
to
yourself
how
pleasantly
and
how
naturally
he
writes
and
how
perfect
a
picture
of
his
disposition
and
feelings
his
style
conveys
poor
dear
fellow
not
a
present
i
have
a
great
mind
to
send
him
all
the
twelve
copies
which
were
to
have
been
dispersed
among
my
near
connections
beginning
with
the
and
ending
with
countess

adieu

austen
miss

saturday
december
my
dear
cassandra
henry
came
back
yesterday
and
might
have
returned
the
day
before
if
he
had
known
as
much
in
time
i
had
the
comfort
of
a
few
lines
on
wednesday
morning
from
henry
himself
just
after
your
letter
was
gone
giving
so
good
an
account
of
his
feelings
as
made
me
perfectly
easy
he
met
with
the
utmost
care
and
attention
at
hanwell
spent
his
two
days
there
very
quietly
and
pleasantly
and
being
certainly
in
no
respect
the
worse
for
going
we
may
believe
that
he
must
be
better
as
he
is
quite
sure
of
being
himself
to
make
his
return
a
complete
gala
haden
was
secured
for
dinner
i
need
not
say
that
our
evening
was
agreeable
but
you
seem
to
be
under
a
mistake
as
to
you
call
him
an
apothecary
he
is
no
apothecary
he
has
never
been
an
apothecary
there
is
not
an
apothecary
in
this
neighbourhood
the
only
inconvenience
of
the
situation
perhaps
but
so
it
is
we
have
not
a
medical
man
within
reach
he
is
a
haden
nothing
but
a
haden
a
sort
of
wonderful
nondescript
creature
on
two
legs
something
between
a
man
and
an
angel
but
without
the
least
spice
of
an
apothecary
he
is
perhaps
the
only
person
an
apothecary
hereabouts
he
has
never
sung
to
us
he
will
not
sing
without
a
pianoforte
accompaniment
i
am
sorry
my
mother
has
been
suffering
and
am
afraid
this
exquisite
weather
is
too
good
to
agree
with
her
enjoy
it
all
over
me
from
top
to
toe
from
right
to
left
longitudinally
perpendicularly
diagonally
and
i
can
not
but
selfishly
hope
we
are
to
have
it
last
till
christmas
nice
unwholesome
unseasonable
relaxing
close
muggy
weather
yours
affectionately
j
a
it
strikes
me
that
i
have
no
business
to
give
the
a
binding
but
we
will
take
counsel
upon
the
question
two
more
letters
were
written
by
the
author
to
her
publisher
while
the
work
was
in
his
hands
on
december
she
writes
as
i
find
that
is
advertised
for
publication
as
early
as
saturday
next
i
think
it
best
to
lose
no
time
in
settling
all
that
remains
to
be
settled
on
the
subject
and
adopt
this
method
as
involving
the
smallest
tax
on
your
time
the
must
be
dedicated
by
permission
to
the
prince
regent
and
it
is
my
particular
wish
that
one
set
should
be
completed
and
sent
to
two
or
three
days
before
the
work
is
generally
public
it
should
be
sent
under
cover
to
the
rev
clarke
librarian
carlton
house
i
shall
subjoin
a
list
of
those
persons
to
whom
i
must
trouble
you
to
forward
also
a
set
each
when
the
work
is
out
all
unbound
with
the
authoress
on
the
first
page
i
return
also
as
ready
for
a
second
edition
i
believe
as
i
can
make
it
i
am
in
hans
place
till
the
from
that
day
inclusive
my
direction
will
be
chawton
alton
hants
on
receipt
of
this
murray
seems
to
have
sent
round
a
note
immediately
asking
if
it
really
was
miss
austen
wish
that
the
dedication
should
be
placed
on
the
for
we
find
jane
writing
again
the
same
day
dear
sir
i
am
very
much
obliged
by
yours
and
very
happy
to
feel
everything
arranged
to
our
mutual
satisfaction
as
to
my
direction
about
the
it
was
arising
from
my
ignorance
only
and
from
my
having
never
noticed
the
proper
place
for
a
dedication
i
thank
you
for
putting
me
right
any
deviation
from
what
is
usually
done
in
such
cases
is
the
last
thing
i
should
wish
for
i
feel
happy
in
having
a
friend
to
save
me
from
the
ill
effect
of
my
own
blunder
on
december
jane
resumed
her
correspondence
with
clarke
dear
sir
my
is
now
so
near
publication
that
i
feel
it
right
to
assure
you
of
my
not
having
forgotten
your
kind
recommendation
of
an
early
copy
for
carlton
house
and
that
i
have
murray
promise
of
its
being
sent
to
his
royal
highness
under
cover
to
you
three
days
previous
to
the
work
being
really
out
i
must
make
use
of
this
opportunity
to
thank
you
dear
sir
for
the
very
high
praise
you
bestow
on
my
other
novels
i
am
too
vain
to
wish
to
convince
you
that
you
have
praised
them
beyond
their
merit
my
greatest
anxiety
at
present
is
that
this
fourth
work
should
not
disgrace
what
was
good
in
the
others
but
on
this
point
i
will
do
myself
the
justice
to
declare
that
whatever
may
be
my
wishes
for
its
success
i
am
very
strongly
haunted
by
the
idea
that
to
those
readers
who
have
preferred
and
it
will
appear
inferior
in
wit
and
to
those
who
have
preferred
very
inferior
in
good
sense
such
as
it
is
however
i
hope
you
will
do
me
the
favour
of
accepting
a
copy
murray
will
have
directions
for
sending
one
i
am
quite
honoured
by
your
thinking
me
capable
of
drawing
such
a
clergyman
as
you
gave
the
sketch
of
in
your
note
of
november
but
i
assure
you
i
am
the
comic
part
of
the
character
i
might
be
equal
to
but
not
the
good
the
enthusiastic
the
literary
such
a
conversation
must
at
times
be
on
subjects
of
science
and
philosophy
of
which
i
know
nothing
or
at
least
occasionally
abundant
in
quotations
and
allusions
which
a
woman
who
like
me
knows
only
her
own
mother
tongue
and
has
read
little
in
that
would
be
totally
without
the
power
of
giving
a
classical
education
or
at
any
rate
a
very
extensive
acquaintance
with
english
literature
ancient
and
modern
appears
to
me
quite
indispensable
for
the
person
who
would
do
any
justice
to
your
clergyman
and
i
think
i
may
boast
myself
to
be
with
all
possible
vanity
the
most
unlearned
and
uninformed
female
who
ever
dared
to
be
an
authoress
believe
me
dear
sir
your
obliged
and
faithful
bl
t
jane
austen
but
clarke
had
not
finished
with
his
suggestions
for
he
replied
in
a
few
days
carlton
house
thursday
december
my
dear
madam
the
letter
you
were
so
obliging
as
to
do
me
the
honour
of
sending
was
forwarded
to
me
in
kent
where
in
a
village
chiddingstone
near
sevenoaks
i
had
been
hiding
myself
from
all
bustle
and
turmoil
and
getting
spirits
for
a
winter
campaign
and
strength
to
stand
the
sharp
knives
which
many
a
shylock
is
wetting
to
cut
more
than
a
pound
of
flesh
from
my
heart
on
the
appearance
of
the
on
monday
i
go
to
lord
egremont
at
petworth
where
your
praises
have
long
been
sounded
as
they
ought
to
be
i
shall
then
look
in
on
the
party
at
the
pavilion
for
a
couple
of
nights
and
return
to
preach
at
park
street
chapel
green
street
on
the
thanksgiving
day
you
were
very
good
to
send
me
which
i
have
in
no
respect
deserved
it
is
gone
to
the
prince
regent
i
have
read
only
a
few
pages
which
i
very
much
admired
there
is
so
much
nature
and
excellent
description
of
character
in
everything
you
describe
pray
continue
to
write
and
make
all
your
friends
send
sketches
to
help
you
and
pour
as
the
french
term
it
do
let
us
have
an
english
clergyman
after
your
fancy
much
novelty
may
be
introduced
show
dear
madam
what
good
would
be
done
if
tythes
were
taken
away
entirely
and
describe
him
burying
his
own
mother
as
i
did
because
the
high
priest
of
the
parish
in
which
she
died
did
not
pay
her
remains
the
respect
he
ought
to
do
i
have
never
recovered
the
shock
carry
your
clergyman
to
sea
as
the
friend
of
some
distinguished
naval
character
about
a
court
you
can
then
bring
forward
like
le
sage
many
interesting
scenes
of
character
and
interest
but
forgive
me
i
can
not
write
to
you
without
wishing
to
elicit
your
genius
and
i
fear
i
can
not
do
that
without
trespassing
on
your
patience
and
good
nature
i
have
desired
murray
to
procure
if
he
can
two
little
works
i
ventured
to
publish
from
being
at
sea
sermons
which
i
wrote
and
preached
on
the
ocean
and
the
edition
which
i
published
of
falconer
pray
dear
madam
remember
that
beside
my
cell
at
carlton
house
i
have
another
which
barne
procured
for
me
at
no
golden
square
where
i
often
hide
myself
there
is
a
small
library
there
much
at
your
service
and
if
you
can
make
the
cell
render
you
any
service
as
a
sort
of
halfway
house
when
you
come
to
town
i
shall
be
most
happy
there
is
a
maid
servant
of
mine
always
there
i
hope
to
have
the
honour
of
sending
you
the
when
it
reaches
a
second
edition
as
some
few
notes
may
possibly
be
then
added
yours
dear
madam
very
sincerely
clarke
it
is
evident
that
what
the
writer
of
the
above
letter
chiefly
desired
was
that
jane
austen
should
depict
a
clergyman
who
should
resemble
no
one
so
much
as
the
rev
clarke
this
is
borne
out
again
in
a
further
letter
in
which
clarke
expressed
the
somewhat
tardy
thanks
of
his
royal
master
pavilion
march
dear
miss
austen
i
have
to
return
you
the
thanks
of
his
royal
highness
the
prince
regent
for
the
handsome
copy
you
sent
him
of
your
last
excellent
novel
pray
dear
madam
soon
write
again
and
again
lord
helens
and
many
of
the
nobility
who
have
been
staying
here
paid
you
the
just
tribute
of
their
praise
the
prince
regent
has
just
left
us
for
london
and
having
been
pleased
to
appoint
me
chaplain
and
private
english
secretary
to
the
prince
of
cobourg
i
remain
here
with
his
serene
highness
and
a
select
party
until
the
marriage
perhaps
when
you
again
appear
in
print
you
may
chuse
to
dedicate
your
volumes
to
prince
leopold
any
historical
romance
illustrative
of
the
history
of
the
august
house
of
cobourg
would
just
now
be
very
interesting
believe
me
at
all
times
dear
miss
austen
your
obliged
friend
clarke
jane
sensible
reply
put
an
end
to
any
further
suggestions
my
dear
sir
i
am
honoured
by
the
prince
thanks
and
very
much
obliged
to
yourself
for
the
kind
manner
in
which
you
mention
the
work
i
have
also
to
acknowledge
a
former
letter
forwarded
to
me
from
hans
place
i
assure
you
i
felt
very
grateful
for
the
friendly
tenor
of
it
and
hope
my
silence
will
have
been
considered
as
it
was
truly
meant
to
proceed
only
from
an
unwillingness
to
tax
your
time
with
idle
thanks
under
every
interesting
circumstance
which
your
own
talent
and
literary
labours
have
placed
you
in
or
the
favour
of
the
regent
bestowed
you
have
my
best
wishes
your
recent
appointments
i
hope
are
a
step
to
something
still
better
in
my
opinion
the
service
of
a
court
can
hardly
be
too
well
paid
for
immense
must
be
the
sacrifice
of
time
and
feeling
required
by
it
you
are
very
very
kind
in
your
hints
as
to
the
sort
of
composition
which
might
recommend
me
at
present
and
i
am
fully
sensible
that
an
historical
romance
founded
on
the
house
of
saxe
cobourg
might
be
much
more
to
the
purpose
of
profit
or
popularity
than
such
pictures
of
domestic
life
in
country
villages
as
i
deal
in
but
i
could
no
more
write
a
romance
than
an
epic
poem
i
could
not
sit
seriously
down
to
write
a
serious
romance
under
any
other
motive
than
to
save
my
life
and
if
it
were
indispensable
for
me
to
keep
it
up
and
never
relax
into
laughing
at
myself
or
at
other
people
i
am
sure
i
should
be
hung
before
i
had
finished
the
first
chapter
no
i
must
keep
to
my
own
style
and
go
on
in
my
own
way
and
though
i
may
never
succeed
again
in
that
i
am
convinced
that
i
should
totally
fail
in
any
other
i
remain
my
dear
sir
your
very
much
obliged
and
sincere
friend
austen
chawton
near
alton
april
footnotes
manor
and
its
page
of
mary
russell
by
the
rev
bentley
we
ought
to
add
that
miss
mitford
admiration
increased
with
time
thus
in
august
she
speaks
of
best
i
think
of
all
her
charming
works
and
at
a
later
date
of
her
in
september
she
mentions
her
death
as
a
loss
and
a
year
afterwards
calls
her

is
only
three

from

byways
in
by
eric
parker
in
support
of

it
has
been
suggested
that
in
chapter
where
mention
is
made
of
this
village
the
author
had
forgotten
to
alter
the
name

was
then
visiting
england
see
a
visit
of
jane
to
scotland
of
which
no
record
is
left
in
family
tradition
is
so
improbable
that
we
must
imagine
her
to
be
referring
to
some
joke
or
possibly
some
forgotten
tale
of
her
own
one
of
our
author
few
inaccuracies
is
to
be
found
in
chapter
where
an

is
made
to
coincide
with
ripe
strawberries
when
her

next
saw

i
have
nothing
but
good
to
say
i
was
sure
of
the
writer
before
you
mentioned
her
the
though
plainly
written
has
yet
some
indeed
many
little
omissions
and
an
expression
may
now
and
then
be
amended
in
passing
through

i
will
readily
undertake
the
revision

kindly
informs
us

at

been

unfortunately
most
of
the

so
far
as
we
know
jane
went
to
london
in
perfectly
sound
in
health
her
remark
to
cassandra
on
her
enjoyment
of
the
muggy
unwholesome
weather
is
written
with
the
security
of
a
person
accustomed
to
be
free
from
bodily
ailments
and
expecting
that
condition
of
things
to
continue
but
alas
we
must
look
upon
this
visit
which
seemed
to
mark
the
highest
point
in
her
modest
fame
as
marking
also
a
downward
stage
in
her
career
as
regards
both
prosperity
and
health
perhaps
the
excitement
of
the
publication
of
and
probably
the
close
attention
on
the
of
her
brother
which
coincided
with
it
possibly
even
the
muggy
weather
which
she
praised
so
highly
combined
to
diminish
her
vigour
and
to
sow
the
seeds
of
a
disease
the
exact
nature
of
which
no
one
seems
ever
to
have
been
able
to
determine
these
however
were
not
the
only
disquieting
circumstances
which
surrounded
her
in
the
following
march
her
favourite
brother
henry
was
declared
a
bankrupt
and
there
are
one
or
two
indications
of
her
being
aware
that
all
was
not
well
with
the
firm
in
the
autumn
the
months
which
intervened
while
this
catastrophe
was
impending
must
have
been
very
trying
to
one
already
weakened
by
all
that
she
had
gone
through
more
agreeable
associations
however
arose
from
the
success
of
there
was
for
instance
a
pleasant
exchange
of
letters
with
the
countess
of
morley
a
lady
of
some
literary
capacity
to
whom
jane
had
sent
a
copy
of
and
who
expressed
her
thanks
and
admiration
in
very
warm
terms
the
author
in
her
turn
speaking
of
lady
morley
approval
says
encourages
me
to
depend
on
the
same
share
of
general
good
opinion
which
predecessors
have
experienced
and
to
believe
that
i
have
not
yet
as
almost
every
writer
of
fancy
does
sooner
or
later
overwritten
myself
the
end
of
march
brought
a
still
more
flattering
tribute
to
growing
fame
in
the
shape
of
an
article
on
in
the
the
though
dated
october
did
not
appear
till
march
of
the
following
year
and
the
writer
of
the
article
was
none
other
than
sir
walter
scott
the
honour
of
an
article
in
the
was
no
doubt
mainly
due
to
the
fact
that
jane
had
published
her
latest
book
with
murray
its
owner
though
the
praise
contained
in
the
article
would
scarcely
satisfy
an
enthusiastic
admirer
of
her
works
miss
austen
felt
she
had
no
cause
to
complain
in
thanking
murray
for
lending
her
a
copy
of
the
she
writes
the
authoress
of
has
no
reason
i
think
to
complain
of
her
treatment
in
it
except
in
the
total
omission
of
i
can
not
but
be
sorry
that
so
clever
a
man
as
the
reviewer
of
should
consider
it
as
unworthy
of
being
noticed
you
will
be
pleased
to
hear
that
i
have
received
the
prince
thanks
for
the
copy
i
sent
him
of
whatever
he
may
think
of
share
of
the
work
yours
seems
to
have
been
quite
right
the
fact
that
she
was
honoured
with
a
notice
in
the
did
not
prevent
the
author
from
collecting
and
leaving
on
record
the
more
domestic
criticisms
of
her
family
and
friends
opinions
of
liked
it
extremely
observing
that
though
there
might
be
more
wit
in
and
and
an
higher
morality
in
yet
altogether
on
account
of
its
peculiar
air
of
nature
throughout
he
preferred
it
to
either
frank
liked
and
admired
it
very
much
indeed
but
must
still
prefer
and
preferred
it
to
all
the
others
better
than
but
not
so
well
as

pleased
with
the
heroine

her
originality
delighted
with
and
called
elton
beyond
praise
dissatisfied
with
jane

better
than
and
but
not
so
well
as
not
so
well
as
either
and
or
could
not
bear
emma
herself
knightley
delightful
should
like
if
she
knew
more
of
her
and
james
did
not
like
it
so
well
as
either
of
the
three
others

different
from
the
others
not
so
easily
read
preferred
it
to
only
liked
by
everybody
not
equal
to
either
and
or
objected
to
the
sameness
of
the
subject
matchmaking
all
through
too
much
of
elton
and
smith
language
superior
to
the
others
thought
it
more
entertaining
than
but
not
so
interesting
as
and
no
characters
in
it
equal
to
lady
catherine
or
collins
thought
it
as
clever
as
either
of
the
others
but
did
not
receive
so
much
pleasure
from
it
as
from
and
and
liked
it
very
much
indeed
and
classed
it
between
and
and
and
miss
liked
it
very
much
but
not
so
much
as
the
others
did
not
think
it
equal
to
either
which
he
liked
the
best
of
all
or
and
displeased
with
my
pictures
of
clergymen
on
reading
it
a
second
time
liked
miss
bates
much
better
than
at
first
and
expressed
herself
as
liking
all
the
people
of
highbury
in
general
except
harriet
smith
but
could
not
help
still
thinking
too
silly
in
her
loves
family
at
upton
all
very
much
amused
with
it
miss
bates
a
great
favourite
with
beaufoy
and
leigh
saw
many
beauties
in
it
but
could
not
think
it
equal
to
and
darcy
and
elizabeth
had
spoilt
them
for
anything
else
however
an
excellent
character
emma
better
luck
than
a
matchmaker
often
has
pitied
jane
fairfax
thought
frank
churchill
better
treated
than
he
deserved
admired
it
very
much
but
did
not
think
it
equal
to
and
which
she
ranked
as
the
very
first
of
its
sort
thought
it
too
natural
to
be
interesting
did
not
like
it
so
well
as
the
others
in
fact
if
she
had
not
known
the
author
would
hardly
have
got
through
it
admired
it
very
much
particularly
elton
very
much
pleased
with
it
delighted
with
miss
bates
but
thought
elton
the
character
in
the
book
however
still
his
favourite
delighted
with
it
admired
the
character
of
emma
isabella
did
not
like
it
objected
to
my
exposing
the
sex
in
the
character
of
the
heroine
convinced
that
i
had
meant
and
miss
bates
for
some
acquaintance
of
theirs
people
whom
i
never
heard
of
before
harriet
admired
it
very
much
but
still
her
favourite
of
all
of
delighted
with
it
liked
it
so
little
that
fanny
would
not
send
me
his
opinion
did
not
much
like
it
thought
it
very
inferior
to
and
liked
it
the
less
from
there
being
a
and
dixon
in
it
thought
the
third
volume
superior
to
anything
i
had
ever
written
quite
beautiful
thought
that
if
there
had
been
more
incident
it
would
be
equal
to
any
of
the
others
the
characters
quite
as
and
supported
as
in
any
and
from
being
more
ones
the
more
entertaining
did
not
like
the
heroine
so
well
as
any
of
the
others
miss
bates
excellent
but
rather
too
much
of
her
and
elton
admirable
and
john
knightley
a
sensible
man
ranked
as
a
composition
with
and
not
so
as
and
nor
so
as
preferred
emma
herself
to
all
the
heroines
the
characters
like
all
the
others
admirably
well
drawn
and
supported
perhaps
rather
less
strongly
marked
than
some
but
only
the
more
natural
for
that
reason
knightley
elton
and
miss
bates
her
favourites
thought
one
or
two
of
the
conversations
too
long
preferred
it
to
but
liked
the
least
of
all
read
only
the
first
and
last
chapters
because
he
had
heard
it
was
not
interesting
lutley
liked
it
very
much
better
than
and
thought
i
had
it
all
about
very
cleverly
in
the
last
volume
wrote
thus
to
fanny
great
many
thanks
for
the
loan
of
which
i
am
delighted
with
i
like
it
better
than
any
every
character
is
thoroughly
kept
up
i
must
enjoy
reading
it
again
with
charles
miss
bates
is
incomparable
but
i
was
nearly
killed
with
those
precious
treasures
they
are
unique
and
really
with
more
fun
than
i
can
express
i
am
at
highbury
all
day
and
i
ca
help
feeling
i
have
just
got
into
a
new
set
of
acquaintance
no
one
writes
such
good
sense
and
so
very
comfortable
did
not
like
it
so
well
as
and
thought
the
authoress
wrong
in
such
times
as
these
to
draw
such
clergymen
as
collins
and
elton
thought
it
much
inferior
to
the
others
of
the
was
kept
up
by
it
three
nights
certainly
inferior
to
all
the
others
wrote
arrived
in
time
to
a
moment
i
am
delighted
with
her
more
so
i
think
than
even
with
my
favourite
and
and
have
read
it
three
times
in
the
passage
thought
it
very
clever
but
did
not
like
it
so
well
as
either
of
the
others
we
do
not
know
how
jeffrey
involuntary
tribute
of
admiration
was
conveyed
to
the
author
but
we
are
sure
she
must
have
valued
it
very
highly
it
was
not
the
first
time
she
had
collected
a
miscellaneous
set
of
opinions
on
her
work
the
two
following
critiques
on
apparently
from
two
ladies
of
the
same
family
will
illustrate
the
sort
of
want
of
comprehension
from
which
the
author
had
to
suffer
when
she
got
outside
the
limits
of
her
own
immediate
circle
much
pleased
with
it
particularly
with
the
character
of
fanny
as
being
so
very
natural
thought
lady
bertram
like
herself
preferred
it
to
either
of
the
others
but
imagined
might
be
want
of
taste
as
she
did
not
understand
wit
augusta
owned
that
she
thought
and
and
and
downright
nonsense
but
expected
to
like
better
and
having
finished
the
first
volume
flattered
herself
she
had
got
through
the
worst
meanwhile
the
of
austen
maunde
and
tilson
had
closed
its
doors
and
on
march
henry
austen
was
declared
a
bankrupt
the
immediate
cause
of
the
collapse
being
the
failure
of
an
alton
bank
which
the
london
firm
had
backed
no
personal
extravagance
was
charged
against
henry
but
he
had
the
unpleasant
sensation
of
starting
life
over
again
and
of
having
caused
serious
loss
to
several
of
his
family
especially
his
brother
edward
and
leigh
perrot
who
had
gone
sureties
for
him
on
his
appointment
as
for
oxfordshire
jane
herself
was
fortunate
in
losing
no
more
than
thirteen
pounds
a
portion
of
the
profits
of
henry
austen
possessed
an
extraordinary
elasticity
of
nature
which
made
a
rebound
from
depression
easy
indeed
almost
inevitable
in
his
case
he
returned
at
once
to
his
original
intention
of
taking
orders
as
if
the
intervening
military
and
banking
career
had
been
nothing
more
than
an
interruption
of
his
normal
course
nor
was
it
merely
perfunctory
performance
of
clerical
duties
to
which
he
looked
forward
he
was
in
earnest
and
began
by
making
use
of
his
former
classical
knowledge
to
take
up
a
serious
study
of
the
new
testament
in
the
original
language
he
seems
to
have
been
in
advance
of
his
age
in
this
respect
for
when
he
went
to
be
examined
by
the
bishop
that
dignitary
after
asking
him
such
questions
as
he
thought
desirable
put
his
hand
on
a
book
which
lay
near
him
on
the
table
and
which
happened
to
be
a
greek
testament
and
said
for
book
austen
i
dare
say
it
is
some
years
since
either
you
or
i
looked
into
it
henry
austen
became
in
time
an
earnest
preacher
of
the
evangelical
school
and
was
for
many
years
perpetual
curate
of
bentley
near
alton
he
did
not
marry
the
favourite
but
found
a
wife
after
some
years
in
miss
eleanor
jackson
who
survived
him
it
must
have
been
somewhere
about
this
time
that
jane
austen
succeeded
in
recovering
the
of
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
secure
the
publication
of
the
novel
in
the
year
has
already
been
noticed
but
we
learn
from
the
that
after
four
works
of
hers
had
been
published
and
somewhat
widely
circulated
one
of
her
brothers
acting
for
her
negotiated
with
the
publisher
who
had
bought
it
and
found
him
very
willing
to
receive
back
his
money
and
resign
all
claim
to
the
copyright
when
the
bargain
was
concluded
and
the
money
paid
but
not
till
then
the
negotiator
had
the
satisfaction
of
informing
him
that
the
work
which
had
been
so
lightly
esteemed
was
by
the
author
of
and
meanwhile
jane
had
been
for
some
months
engaged
on
it
was
begun
before
she
went
to
london
in
the
autumn
of
for
the
publication
of
but
that
visit
and
all
that
happened
to
her
during
the
winter
must
certainly
have
interrupted
its
composition
and
possibly
modified
its
tone
it
is
less
and
more
tender
in
its
description
of
a
stricken
heart
than
anything
she
had
attempted
before
in
may
cassandra
and
jane
left
chawton
to
spend
three
weeks
at
cheltenham
stopping
with
their
brother
at
steventon
and
with
the
fowles
at
kintbury
on
the
way
and
again
at
steventon
on
their
return
jane
must
have
been
decidedly
out
of
health
for
the
change
in
her
did
not
escape
the
notice
of
her
friends
but
whatever
was
the
exact
state
of
her
health
during
the
first
half
of
this
year
it
did
not
prevent
her
from
being
able
on
july
to
write
at
the
end
of
the
first
draft
of
and
thereby
hangs
an
interesting
tale
which
we
can
not
do
better
than
relate
in
the
words
of
the
the
book
had
been
brought
to
an
end
in
july
and
the
of
the
hero
and
heroine
effected
in
a
totally
different
manner
in
a
scene
laid
at
admiral
croft
lodgings
but
her
performance
did
not
satisfy
her
she
thought
it
tame
and
flat
and
was
desirous
of
producing
something
better
this
weighed
upon
her
mind
the
more
so
probably
on
account
of
the
weak
state
of
her
health
so
that
one
night
she
retired
to
rest
in
very
low
spirits
but
such
depression
was
little
in
accordance
with
her
nature
and
was
soon
shaken
off
the
next
morning
she
awoke
to
more
cheerful
views
and
brighter
inspirations
the
sense
of
power
revived
and
imagination
resumed
its
course
she
cancelled
the
condemned
chapter
and
wrote
two
others
entirely
different
in
its
stead
the
result
is
that
we
possess
the
visit
of
the
musgrove
party
to
bath
the
crowded
and
animated
scenes
at
the
white
hart
hotel
and
the
charming
conversation
between
captain
harville
and
anne
elliot
overheard
by
captain
wentworth
by
which
the
two
faithful
lovers
were
at
last
led
to
understand
each
feelings
the
tenth
and
eleventh
chapters
of
then
rather
than
the
actual
of
the
story
contain
the
latest
of
her
printed
compositions
her
last
contribution
to
the
entertainment
of
the
public
perhaps
it
may
be
thought
that
she
has
seldom
written
anything
more
brilliant
and
that
independent
of
the
original
manner
in
which
the
is
brought
about
the
pictures
of
charles
musgrove
boyishness
and
of
his
wife
jealous
selfishness
would
have
been
incomplete
without
these
finishing
strokes
the
cancelled
chapter
exists
in
manuscript
it
is
certainly
inferior
to
the
two
which
were
substituted
for
it
but
it
was
such
as
some
writers
and
some
readers
might
have
been
contented
with
and
it
contained
touches
which
scarcely
any
other
hand
could
have
given
the
suppression
of
which
may
be
almost
a
matter
of
regret
for
the
cancelled
chapter
in
and
for
other
posthumous
writings
of
the
author
we
will
refer
our
readers
to
the
second
edition
of
the
they
will
not
fail
to
note
the
delicate
touches
put
to
the

the
added
chapters
take
one
altogether
into
a
higher
province
of
fiction
where
the
deepest
emotion
and
the
most
delicate
humour
are
blended
in
one
scene
a
scene
that
makes
one
think
that
had
its
author
lived
we
might
have
had
later
masterpieces
of
a
different
type
from
that
of
their
predecessors
is
of
about
the
same
length
as
and
it
seems
natural
to
suppose
that
there
was
some
purpose
in
this
similarity
and
that
the
two
works
were
intended
to
be
published
together
as
in
the
end
they
were
each
as
a
novel
she
certainly
contemplated
the
publication
of
which
at
that
stage
bore
the
name
of
after
she
had
recovered
it
in
and
when
she
wrote
the
which
appears
in
the
first
edition
of
the
book
yet
afterwards
she
seems
rather
to
have
gone
back
from
this
intention
writing
to
fanny
knight
march
she
says
i
answer
your
kind
questions
more
than
you
expect
is
put
upon
the
shelf
for
the
present
and
i
do
not
know
that
she
will
ever
come
out
but
i
have
a
something
ready
for
publication
which
may
perhaps
appear
about
a
twelvemonth
hence
it
is
short
about
the
length
of
this
is
for
yourself
alone
is
of
course
and
the
is
she
returns
to
the
latter
in
writing
again
to
fanny
march
telling
her
she
will
not
like
it
and
adding
may
perhaps
like
the
heroine
as
she
is
almost
too
good
for
me
two
remarkable
points
in
these
extracts
are
the
statement
that
was
for
publication
but
was
not
to
appear
for
a
twelvemonth
and
the
idea
that
the
character
of
the
heroine
was
as
it
were
imposed
upon
the
author
by
an
external
force
which
she
was
powerless
to
resist
the
intended
delay
in
publishing
shows
how
unwilling
she
was
to
let
anything
go
till
she
was
quite
sure
she
had
polished
it
to
the
utmost
and
we
may
imagine
that
had
health
returned
the
one
comparatively
dull
and
lifeless
part
of
the
book
the
long
story
of
smith
would
have
been
somehow
or
other
brought
to
life
by
touches
which
she
knew
so
well
how
to
impart
as
for
the
doubt
about
publishing
at
all
it
was
not
unnatural
she
might
reasonably
hesitate
to
put
an
immature
work
by
the
side
of
her
most
mature
she
might
and
we
know
that
she
feel
that
the
social
usages
of
sixteen
years
ago
which
she
was
describing
in
this
tale
were
no
longer
those
of
the
day
and
it
was
possible
that
a
satire
on
radcliffe
was
not
what
the
public
now
wanted
the
members
of
the
austen
family
who
managed
the
publication
of
her
novels
after
her
death
thought
differently
and
we
are
grateful
to
them
for
having
done
so
had
she
followed
all
the
advice
given
her
by
her
friends
she
would
have
produced
something
very
different
from
either
or
it
must
have
been
in
the
course
of
the
year
that
she
drew
up
the
following
of
a
novel

to

in

from
information
kindly
supplied
by
john
murray
after
a
short
mention
of

in
which
sir
walter
unkindly
suggests
that
lizzie
bennet
in
refusing
darcy
not
perceive
that
she
has
done
a
foolish
thing
until
she
accidentally
visits
a
very
handsome
seat
and
grounds
belonging
to
her
admirer
the
critic
devotes
considerable
space
including
a
long
quotation
to
summing
up
he
declares
as
follows
the
reader
may
collect
from
the
preceding
specimen
both
the
merits
and
faults
of
the
author
the
former
consist
much
in
the
force
of
a
narrative
conducted
with
much
neatness
and
point
and
a
quiet
yet
comic
dialogue
in
which
the
characters
of
the
speakers
evolve
themselves
with
dramatic
effect
the
faults
on
the
contrary
arise
from
the
minute
detail
which
the
author
plan
comprehends
characters
of
folly
or
simplicity
such
as
those
of
old
woodhouse
and
miss
bates
are
ridiculous
when
first
presented
but
if
too
often
brought
forward
or
too
long
dwelt
upon
their
prosing
is
apt
to
become
as
tiresome
in
fiction
as
in
real
society
had
not
sir
walter
found
it
necessary
to
be
somewhat
apologetic
in
commending
in
public
anything
so
frivolous
as
a
novel
his
praise
would
probably
have
been
more
as
in
the
passage
in
his
diary
under
date
march
again
for
the
third
time
at
least
miss
austen
finely
written
novel
of
and
that
young
lady
has
a
talent
for
describing
the
involvements
and
feelings
and
characters
of
ordinary
life
which
is
to
me
the
most
wonderful
i
ever
met
with
the
big
strain
i
can
do
myself
like
any
now
going
but
the
exquisite
touch
which
renders
ordinary
commonplace
things
and
characters
interesting
from
the
truth
of
the
description
and
the
sentiment
is
denied
to
me
what
a
pity
such
a
gifted
creature
died
so
early
no
division
or
bitterness
seems
to
have
been
caused
in
the
family
by
these
events
a
remarkable
proof
of
the
strong
affection
which
united
them

any
attempt
at
depicting
the
charm
and
attractiveness
of
jane
character
must
be
quite
incomplete
if
it
fails
to
take
into
account
the
special
manner
in
which
she
showed
these
qualities
as
an
aunt
she
herself
says
in
joke
to
a
young
niece
that
she
had
always
maintained
the
importance
of
aunts
and
she
evidently
felt
in
all
seriousness
the
responsibility
of
that
relationship
though
she
would
have
been
one
of
the
last
to
display
her
sense
of
it
by
any
didactic
or
authoritative
utterance
the
author
of
the
tells
us
that
her
two
nieces
who
were
grown
up
in
her
lifetime
could
say
how
valuable
to
them
had
been
her
advice
in
little
difficulties
and
doubts
of
early
womanhood

very
interesting
conversation

delicious
morning

very
snug

the
sad
ending

the
misery
of
losing
my
dear
aunt
jane
after
a
lingering
illness
some
letters
of
hers
to
three
of

a

value
and

as

fanny
knight
sensible
as
she
was
and
early
accustomed
to
responsibility
felt
at
a
loss
how
to
distinguish
in
her
own
mind
between
inclination
and
love
when
seriously
courted
in
by
a
man
of
unexceptionable
position
and
character
a
reference
to
her
aunt
brought
her
two
delightful
letters
no
definite
opinion
was
expressed
or
formal
advice
given
in
these
letters
but
they
must
have
helped
her
by
their
sympathy
and
cleared
her
mind
by
the
steadiness
with
which
they
contemplated
the
case
in
all
its
bearings
chawton
friday
november
i
feel
quite
as
doubtful
as
you
could
be
my
dearest
fanny
as
to
my
letter
may
be
finished
for
i
can
command
very
little
quiet
time
at
present
but
yet
i
must
begin
for
i
know
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
as
soon
as
possible
and
i
really
am
impatient
myself
to
be
writing
something
on
so
very
interesting
a
subject
though
i
have
no
hope
of
writing
anything
to
the
purpose
i
shall
do
very
little
more
i
dare
say
than
say
over
again
what
you
have
said
before
i
was
certainly
a
good
deal
surprised
as
i
had
no
suspicion
of
any
change
in
your
feelings
and
i
have
no
scruple
in
saying
that
you
can
not
be
in
love
my
dear
fanny
i
am
ready
to
laugh
at
the
idea
and
yet
it
is
no
laughing
matter
to
have
had
you
so
mistaken
as
to
your
own
feelings
and
with
all
my
heart
i
wish
i
had
cautioned
you
on
that
point
when
first
you
spoke
to
me
but
though
i
did
not
think
you
then
in
love
i
did
consider
you
as
being
attached
in
a
degree
quite
sufficiently
for
happiness
as
i
had
no
doubt
it
would
increase
with
opportunity
and
from
the
time
of
our
being
in
london
together
i
thought
you
really
very
much
in
love
but
you
certainly
are
not
at
all
there
is
no
concealing
it
what
strange
creatures
we
are
it
seems
as
if
your
being
secure
of
him
had
made
you
indifferent
he
is
just
what
he
ever
was
only
more
evidently
and
uniformly
devoted
to
this
is
all
the
difference
how
shall
we
account
for
it
my
dearest
fanny
i
am
writing
what
will
not
be
of
the
smallest
use
to
you
i
am
feeling
differently
every
moment
and
shall
not
be
able
to
suggest
a
single
thing
that
can
assist
your
mind
i
could
lament
in
one
sentence
and
laugh
in
the
next
but
as
to
opinion
or
counsel
i
am
sure
that
none
will
be
extracted
worth
having
from
this
letter
poor
dear
oh
dear
fanny
your
mistake
has
been
one
that
thousands
of
women
fall
into
he
was
the
young
man
who
attached
himself
to
you
that
was
the
charm
and
most
powerful
it
is
among
the
multitudes
however
that
make
the
same
mistake
with
yourself
there
can
be
few
indeed
who
have
so
little
reason
to
regret
it
character
and
attachment
leave
you
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
upon
the
whole
what
is
to
be
done
you
have
no
inclination
for
any
other
person
his
situation
in
life
family
friends
and
above
all
his
character
his
uncommonly
amiable
mind
strict
principles
just
notions
good
habits
that
know
so
well
how
to
value
that
is
really
of
the
first
importance
everything
of
this
nature
pleads
his
cause
most
strongly
you
have
no
doubt
of
his
having
superior
abilities
he
has
proved
it
at
the
university
he
is
i
dare
say
such
a
scholar
as
your
agreeable
idle
brothers
would
ill
bear
a
comparison
with
oh
my
dear
fanny
the
more
i
write
about
him
the
warmer
my
feelings
become
the
more
strongly
i
feel
the
sterling
worth
of
such
a
young
man
and
the
desirableness
of
your
growing
in
love
with
him
again
i
recommend
this
most
thoroughly
there
such
beings
in
the
world
perhaps
one
in
a
thousand
as
the
creature
you
and
i
should
think
perfection
where
grace
and
spirit
are
united
to
worth
where
the
manners
are
equal
to
the
heart
and
understanding
but
such
a
person
may
not
come
in
your
way
or
if
he
does
he
may
not
be
the
eldest
son
of
a
man
of
fortune
the
near
relation
of
your
particular
friend
and
belonging
to
your
own
county
think
of
all
this
fanny
has
advantages
which
we
do
not
often
meet
in
one
person
his
only
fault
indeed
seems
modesty
if
he
were
less
modest
he
would
be
more
agreeable
speak
louder
and
look
impudenter
and
is
not
it
a
fine
character
of
which
modesty
is
the
only
defect
i
have
no
doubt
he
will
get
more
lively
and
more
like
yourselves
as
he
is
more
with
you
he
will
catch
your
ways
if
he
belongs
to
you
and
as
to
there
being
any
objection
from
his
from
the
danger
of
his
becoming
even
evangelical
i
can
not
admit
i
am
by
no
means
convinced
that
we
ought
not
all
to
be
evangelicals
and
am
at
least
persuaded
that
they
who
are
so
from
reason
and
feeling
must
be
happiest
and
safest
and
now
my
dear
fanny
having
written
so
much
on
one
side
of
the
question
i
shall
turn
round
and
entreat
you
not
to
commit
yourself
farther
and
not
to
think
of
accepting
him
unless
you
really
do
like
him
anything
is
to
be
preferred
or
endured
rather
than
marrying
without
affection
and
if
his
deficiencies
of
manner
strike
you
more
than
all
his
good
qualities
if
you
continue
to
think
strongly
of
them
give
him
up
at
once
things
are
now
in
such
a
state
that
you
must
resolve
upon
one
or
the
other
either
to
allow
him
to
go
on
as
he
has
done
or
whenever
you
are
together
behave
with
a
coldness
which
may
convince
him
that
he
has
been
deceiving
himself
i
have
no
doubt
of
his
suffering
a
good
deal
for
a
time
a
great
deal
when
he
feels
that
he
must
give
you
up
but
it
is
no
creed
of
mine
as
you
must
be
well
aware
that
such
sort
of
disappointments
kill
anybody
yours
very
affectionately
jane
austen
hans
place
wednesday
november
now
my
dearest
fanny
i
will
begin
a
subject
which
comes
in
very
naturally
you
frighten
me
out
of
my
wits
by
your
reference
your
affection
gives
me
the
highest
pleasure
but
indeed
you
must
not
let
anything
depend
on
my
opinion
your
own
feelings
and
none
but
your
own
should
determine
such
an
important
point
so
far
however
as
answering
your
question
i
have
no
scruple
i
am
perfectly
convinced
that
your
present
feelings
supposing
you
were
to
marry
would
be
sufficient
for
his
happiness
but
when
i
think
how
very
very
far
it
is
from
a
and
take
everything
that
into
consideration
i
dare
not
say
to
accept
him
the
risk
is
too
great
for
unless
your
own
sentiments
prompt
it
you
will
think
me
perverse
perhaps
in
my
last
letter
i
was
urging
everything
in
his
favour
and
now
i
am
inclining
the
other
way
but
i
can
not
help
it
i
am
at
present
more
impressed
with
the
possible
evil
that
may
arise
to
from
engaging
yourself
to
him
in
word
or
mind
than
with
anything
else
when
i
consider
how
few
young
men
you
have
yet
seen
much
of
how
capable
you
are
yes
i
do
still
think
you
capable
of
being
really
in
love
and
how
full
of
temptation
the
next
six
or
seven
years
of
your
life
will
probably
be
it
is
the
very
period
of
life
for
the
attachments
to
be
formed
i
can
not
wish
you
with
your
present
very
cool
feelings
to
devote
yourself
in
honour
to
him
it
is
very
true
that
you
never
may
attach
another
man
his
equal
altogether
but
if
that
other
man
has
the
power
of
attaching
you
he
will
be
in
your
eyes
the
most
perfect
i
shall
be
glad
if
you
revive
past
feelings
and
from
your
unbiassed
self
resolve
to
go
on
as
you
have
done
but
this
i
do
not
expect
and
without
it
i
can
not
wish
you
to
be
fettered
i
should
not
be
afraid
of
your
him
with
all
his
worth
you
would
soon
love
him
enough
for
the
happiness
of
both
but
i
should
dread
the
continuance
of
this
sort
of
tacit
engagement
with
such
an
uncertainty
as
there
is
of
it
may
be
completed
years
may
pass
before
he
is
independent
you
like
him
well
enough
to
marry
but
not
well
enough
to
wait
the
unpleasantness
of
appearing
fickle
is
certainly
great
but
if
you
think
you
want
punishment
for
past
illusions
there
it
is
and
nothing
can
be
compared
to
the
misery
of
being
bound
love
bound
to
one
and
preferring
another
is
a
punishment
which
you
do
deserve
i
shall
be
most
glad
to
hear
from
you
again
my
dearest
fanny
but
it
must
not
be
later
than
saturday
as
we
shall
be
off
on
monday
long
before
the
letters
are
delivered
and
write
that
may
do
to
be
read
or
told
i
can
not
suppose
we
differ
in
our
ideas
of
the
christian
religion
you
have
given
an
excellent
description
of
it
we
only
affix
a
different
meaning
to
the
word
yours
most
affectionately
austen
miss
knight
godmersham
park
faversham
kent
two
remarks
in
these
letters
seem
to
betray
the
close
observer
of
human
nature
from
the
novelist
point
of
view
her
optimistic
opinion
as
to
recovery
from
disappointments
in
love
may
perhaps
be
adduced
by
some
critics
as
an
argument
to
show
that
her
feelings
were
not
very
deep
we
should
rather
quote
them
as
an
instance
of
her
candour
of
her
saying
what
other
writers
can
not
help
thinking
though
they
may
not
like
to
express
the
thought
readers
of
are
well
aware
that
the
author
made
room
for
cases
at
all
events
in
the
lives
of
women
where
such
disappointments
though
they
may
not
kill
yet
give
a
sombre
tone
to
the
life
and
spirits
of
the
sufferer
through
a
long
series
of
years
there
is
close
observation
also
in
the
distinction
drawn
between
the
amount
of
love
sufficient
for
a
speedy
marriage
and
that
necessary
for
a
long
engagement
if
unhappiness
and
possible
discredit
are
to
be
avoided
on
this
occasion
neither
marriage
nor
engagement
happened
to
fanny
knight
her
son
tells
us
that
differences
in
religious
ideas
tended
by
degrees
to
separate
the
lovers
if
lovers
they
could
be
called
her
doubt
as
to
caring
enough
for
a
became
a
certainty
in
the
course
of
the
year
when
her
aunt
in
november
of
that
year
joked
with
her
about
an
imaginary
tenderness
for
haden
apothecary
it
was
no
doubt
pure
but
we
may
be
sure
she
would
not
have
indulged
in
it
if
any
serious
attachment
had
then
occupied
her
niece
mind
the
remaining
letters
of
this
series
which
we
possess
were
written
after
an
interval
of
more
than
two
years
in
february
and
march
only
a
few
months
before
jane
death
all
idea
of
engaging
herself
to
a
has
now
passed
away
yet
with
natural
inconsistency
she
lives
in
dread
of
his
marrying
some
one
else
by
this
time
there
is
a
b
on
the
stage
but
his
courtship
though
apparently
demonstrative
is
not
really
serious
and
the
last
letter
keeps
away
from
love
affairs
altogether
as
to
we
are
told
that
he
found
his
happiness
elsewhere
within
a
couple
of
years
while
fanny
became
engaged
to
sir
edward
knatchbull
in
chawton
february
my
dearest
fanny
you
are
inimitable
irresistible
you
are
the
delight
of
my
life
such
letters
such
entertaining
letters
as
you
have
lately
sent
such
a
description
of
your
queer
little
heart
such
a
lovely
display
of
what
imagination
does
you
are
worth
your
weight
in
gold
or
even
in
the
new
silver
coinage
i
can
not
express
to
you
what
i
have
felt
in
reading
your
history
of
yourself
how
full
of
pity
and
concern
and
admiration
and
amusement
i
have
been
you
are
the
paragon
of
all
that
is
silly
and
sensible
and
eccentric
sad
and
lively
provoking
and
interesting
who
can
keep
pace
with
the
fluctuations
of
your
fancy
the
capprizios
of
your
taste
the
contradictions
of
your
feelings
you
are
so
odd
and
all
the
time
so
perfectly
natural
so
peculiar
in
yourself
and
yet
so
like
everybody
else
it
is
very
very
gratifying
to
me
to
know
you
so
intimately
you
can
hardly
think
what
a
pleasure
it
is
to
me
to
have
such
thorough
pictures
of
your
heart
oh
what
a
loss
it
will
be
when
you
are
married
you
are
too
agreeable
in
your
single
state
too
agreeable
as
a
niece
i
shall
hate
you
when
your
delicious
play
of
mind
is
all
settled
down
into
conjugal
and
maternal
affections
b
frightens
me
he
will
have
you
i
see
you
at
the
altar
i
have
faith
in
cage
observation
and
still
more
in
lizzy
and
besides
i
know
it
be
so
he
must
be
wishing
to
attach
you
it
would
be
too
stupid
and
too
shameful
in
him
to
be
otherwise
and
all
the
family
are
seeking
your
acquaintance
do
not
imagine
that
i
have
any
real
objection
i
have
rather
taken
a
fancy
to
him
than
not
and
i
like
the
house
for
you
i
only
do
not
like
you
should
marry
anybody
and
yet
i
do
wish
you
to
marry
very
much
because
i
know
you
will
never
be
happy
till
you
are
but
the
loss
of
a
fanny
knight
will
be
never
made
up
to
me
my
niece
b
will
be
but
a
poor
substitute
i
do
not
like
your
being
nervous
and
so
apt
to
cry
it
is
a
sign
you
are
not
quite
well
i
enjoy
your
visit
to
goodnestone
it
must
be
a
great
pleasure
to
you
you
have
not
seen
fanny
cage
in
comfort
so
long
i
hope
she
represents
and
remonstrates
and
reasons
with
you
properly
why
should
you
be
living
in
dread
of
his
marrying
somebody
else
yet
how
natural
you
did
not
choose
to
have
him
yourself
why
not
allow
him
to
take
comfort
where
he
can
in
your
conscience
you
that
he
could
not
bear
a
companion
with
a
more
animated
character
you
can
not
forget
how
you
felt
under
the
idea
of
its
having
been
possible
that
he
might
have
dined
in
hans
place
my
dearest
fanny
i
can
not
bear
you
should
be
unhappy
about
him
think
of
his
principles
think
of
his
father
objection
of
want
of
money
but
i
am
doing
no
good
no
all
that
i
urge
against
him
will
rather
make
you
take
his
part
more
sweet
perverse
fanny
and
now
i
will
tell
you
that
we
like
your
henry
to
the
utmost
to
the
very
top
of
the
glass
quite
brimful
he
is
a
very
pleasing
young
man
i
do
not
see
how
he
could
be
mended
he
does
really
bid
fair
to
be
everything
his
father
and
sister
could
wish
and
william
i
love
very
much
indeed
and
so
we
do
all
he
is
quite
our
own
william
in
short
we
are
very
comfortable
together
that
is
we
can
answer
for
i
had
no
idea
when
i
began
this
yesterday
of
sending
it
before
your
brother
went
back
but
i
have
written
away
my
foolish
thoughts
at
such
a
rate
that
i
will
not
keep
them
many
hours
longer
to
stare
me
in
the
face
ben
and
anna
walked
here
last
sunday
to
hear
uncle
henry
and
she
looked
so
pretty
it
was
quite
a
pleasure
to
see
her
so
young
and
so
blooming
and
so
innocent
your
objection
to
the
quadrilles
delighted
me
exceedingly
pretty
well
for
a
lady
irrecoverably
attached
to
person
sweet
fanny
believe
no
such
thing
of
yourself
spread
no
such
malicious
slander
upon
your
understanding
within
the
precincts
of
your
imagination
do
not
speak
ill
of
your
sense
merely
for
the
gratification
of
your
fancy
yours
is
sense
which
deserves
more
honourable
treatment
you
are
in
love
with
him
you
never
been
really
in
love
with
him
yours
very
affectionately
austen
chawton
thursday
march
as
to
making
any
adequate
return
for
such
a
letter
as
yours
my
dearest
fanny
it
is
absolutely
impossible
if
i
were
to
labour
at
it
all
the
rest
of
my
life
and
live
to
the
age
of
methuselah
i
could
never
accomplish
anything
so
long
and
so
perfect
but
i
can
not
let
william
go
without
a
few
lines
of
acknowledgment
and
reply
i
have
pretty
well
done
with
by
your
description
he
be
in
love
with
you
however
he
may
try
at
it
and
i
could
not
wish
the
match
unless
there
were
a
great
deal
of
love
on
his
side
poor
milles
that
she
should
die
on
the
wrong
day
at
last
after
being
about
it
so
long
it
was
unlucky
that
the
goodnestone
party
could
not
meet
you
and
i
hope
her
friendly
obliging
social
spirit
which
delighted
in
drawing
people
together
was
not
conscious
of
the
division
and
disappointment
she
was
occasioning
i
am
sorry
and
surprised
that
you
speak
of
her
as
having
little
to
leave
and
must
feel
for
miss
milles
though
she
molly
if
a
material
loss
of
income
is
to
attend
her
other
loss
single
women
have
a
dreadful
propensity
for
being
poor
which
is
one
very
strong
argument
in
favour
of
matrimony
but
i
need
not
dwell
on
such
arguments
with
pretty
dear
to
you
i
shall
say
as
i
have
often
said
before
do
not
be
in
a
hurry
the
right
man
will
come
at
last
you
will
in
the
course
of
the
next
two
or
three
years
meet
with
somebody
more
generally
unexceptionable
than
anyone
you
have
yet
known
who
will
love
you
as
warmly
as
possible
and
who
will
so
completely
attract
you
that
you
will
feel
you
never
really
loved
before
aunt
cassandra
walked
to
wyards
yesterday
with
digweed
anna
has
had
a
bad
cold
and
looks
pale
she
has
just
weaned
julia
chawton
sunday
march
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
my
dearest
fanny
for
sending
me
conversation
i
had
great
amusement
in
reading
it
and
i
hope
i
am
not
affronted
and
do
not
think
the
worse
of
him
for
having
a
brain
so
very
different
from
mine
but
my
strongest
sensation
of
all
is
at
your
being
able
to
press
him
on
the
subject
so
perseveringly
and
i
agree
with
your
papa
that
it
was
not
fair
when
he
knows
the
truth
he
will
be
uncomfortable
you
are
the
oddest
creature
nervous
enough
in
some
respects
but
in
others
perfectly
without
nerves
quite
unrepulsable
hardened
and
impudent
do
not
oblige
him
to
read
any
more
have
mercy
on
him
tell
him
the
truth
and
make
him
an
apology
he
and
i
should
not
in
the
least
agree
of
course
in
our
ideas
of
novels
and
heroines
pictures
of
perfection
as
you
know
make
me
sick
and
wicked
but
there
is
some
very
good
sense
in
what
he
says
and
i
particularly
respect
him
for
wishing
to
think
well
of
all
young
ladies
it
shows
an
amiable
and
a
delicate
mind
and
he
deserves
better
treatment
than
to
be
obliged
to
read
any
more
of
my
works
do
not
be
surprised
at
finding
uncle
henry
acquainted
with
my
having
another
ready
for
publication
i
could
not
say
no
when
he
asked
me
but
he
knows
nothing
more
of
it
you
will
not
like
it
so
you
need
not
be
impatient
you
may
like
the
heroine
as
she
is
almost
too
good
for
me
thank
you
for
everything
you
tell
me
i
do
not
feel
worthy
of
it
by
anything
that
i
can
say
in
return
but
i
assure
you
my
pleasure
in
your
letters
is
quite
as
great
as
ever
and
i
am
interested
and
amused
just
as
you
could
wish
me
the
papillons
came
back
on
friday
night
but
i
have
not
seen
them
yet
as
i
do
not
venture
to
church
i
can
not
hear
however
but
that
they
are
the
same
and
his
sister
they
used
to
be
very
affectionately
yours
austen
miss
knight
godmersham
park
canterbury
very
different
in
tone
and
subject
were
the
letters
addressed
about
the
same
time
as
the
two
earlier
of
this
series
to
her
other
niece
anna
not
that
anna
was
without
her
own
love
story
on
the
contrary
it
came
to
a
straightforward
and
satisfactory
climax
in
her
marriage
to
ben
lefroy
which
took
place
in
november
and
no
doubt
she
like
her
cousin
had
received
letters
of
sympathy
and
advice
on
the
realities
of
life
from
her
aunt
her
own
romance
however
did
not
prevent
her
from
interesting
herself
in
the
creations
of
her
brain
indeed
all
the
three
children
of
james
austen
anna
edward
and
little
caroline
had
indulged
freely
in
the
delights
of
authorship
from
a
very
youthful
age
it
was
a
novel
of
anna
which
caused
the
present
correspondence
and
we
can
see
from
the
delicate
hints
of
her
aunt
that
and
and
had
not
been
without
their
influence
over
its
matter
and
style
readers
of
these
letters
will
note
the
kindness
with
which
jane
now
deep
in
the
composition
of
turns
aside
from
her
own
work
to
criticise
and
encourage
associating
her
views
all
the
time
with
those
of
cassandra
who
was
to
her
like
a
court
of
appeal
and
allowing
ample
freedom
of
judgment
also
to
anna
herself
they
will
see
also
that
her
vote
is
for
and
spirit
above
everything
while
yet
she
insists
on
the
necessity
of
accuracy
of
detail
for
producing
the
illusion
of
truth
in
fiction
may
or
june
my
dear
anna
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
sending
your
ms
it
has
entertained
me
extremely
all
of
us
indeed
i
read
it
aloud
to
your
grandmama
and
aunt
cass
and
we
were
all
very
much
pleased
the
spirit
does
not
droop
at
all
sir
lady
helena
and
julian
are
very
well
done
and
cecilia
continues
to
be
interesting
in
spite
of
her
being
so
amiable
it
was
very
fit
you
should
advance
her
age
i
like
the
beginning
of
devereux
forester
very
much
a
great
deal
better
than
if
he
had
been
very
good
or
very
bad
a
few
verbal
corrections
are
all
that
i
felt
tempted
to
make
i
do
not
like
a
lover
speaking
in
the
person
it
is
too
much
like
the
formal
part
of
lord
orville
and
i
think
is
not
natural
if
think
differently
however
you
need
not
mind
me
i
am
impatient
for
more
and
only
wait
for
a
safe
conveyance
to
return
this
book
august
i
like
the
name
is
the
very
well
and
i
dare
say
shall
grow
to
like
it
very
much
in
time
but
was
something
so
very
superior
that
every
common
title
must
appear
to
disadvantage
i
am
not
sensible
of
any
blunders
about
dawlish
the
library
was
particularly
pitiful
and
wretched
twelve
years
ago
and
not
likely
to
have
anybody
publications
there
is
no
such
title
as
desborough
either
among
dukes
marquises
earls
viscounts
or
barons
these
were
your
inquiries
i
will
now
thank
you
for
your
envelope
received
this
morning
your
aunt
cass
is
as
well
pleased
with
julian
as
ever
and
i
am
delighted
with
the
idea
of
seeing
progillian
again
we
have
now
just
finished
the
first
of
the
three
books
i
had
the
pleasure
of
receiving
yesterday
i
read
it
aloud
and
we
are
all
very
much
amused
and
like
the
work
quite
as
well
as
ever
i
depend
on
getting
through
another
book
before
dinner
but
there
is
really
a
good
deal
of
respectable
reading
in
your
pages
i
have
no
doubt
six
will
make
a
very
volume
you
must
be
quite
pleased
to
have
accomplished
so
much
i
like
lord
portman
and
his
brother
very
much
i
am
only
afraid
that
lord
good
nature
will
make
most
people
like
him
better
than
he
deserves
the
whole
portman
family
are
very
good
and
lady
anne
who
was
your
great
dread
you
have
succeeded
particularly
well
with
bell
griffin
is
just
what
she
should
be
my
corrections
have
not
been
more
important
than
before
here
and
there
we
have
thought
the
sense
could
be
expressed
in
fewer
words
and
i
have
scratched
out
sir
thos
from
walking
with
the
other
men
to
the
stables
the
very
day
after
his
breaking
his
arm
for
though
i
find
your
papa
did
walk
out
immediately
after
arm
was
set
i
think
it
can
be
so
little
usual
as
to
appear
unnatural
in
a
book
lyme
will
not
do
lyme
is
towards
forty
distance
from
dawlish
and
would
not
be
talked
of
there
i
have
put
starcross
instead
if
you
prefer
exeter
that
must
be
always
safe
i
have
also
scratched
out
the
introduction
between
lord
portman
and
his
brother
and
griffin
a
country
surgeon
do
tell
lyford
would
not
be
introduced
to
men
of
their
rank
i
think
you
had
better
omit
lady
postscript
to
those
that
are
acquainted
with
and
it
will
seem
an
imitation
we
are
reading
the
last
book
they
must
be
two
days
going
from
dawlish
to
bath
they
are
nearly
miles
apart
we
finished
it
last
night
after
our
return
from
drinking
tea
at
the
great
house
the
last
chapter
does
not
please
us
quite
so
well
we
do
not
thoroughly
like
the
play
perhaps
from
having
had
too
much
of
plays
in
that
way
lately
and
we
think
you
had
better
not
leave
england
let
the
portmans
go
to
ireland
but
as
you
know
nothing
of
the
manners
there
you
had
better
not
go
with
them
you
will
be
in
danger
of
giving
false
representations
stick
to
bath
and
the
foresters
there
you
will
be
quite
at
home
your
aunt
does
not
like
desultory
novels
and
is
rather
afraid
yours
will
be
too
much
so
that
there
will
be
too
frequently
a
change
from
one
set
of
people
to
another
and
that
circumstances
will
be
sometimes
introduced
of
apparent
consequence
which
will
lead
to
nothing
it
will
not
be
so
great
an
objection
to
if
it
does
i
allow
much
more
latitude
than
she
does
and
think
nature
and
spirit
cover
many
sins
of
a
wandering
story
and
people
in
general
do
not
care
so
much
about
it
for
your
comfort
i
should
like
to
have
had
more
of
devereux
i
do
not
feel
enough
acquainted
with
him
you
were
afraid
of
meddling
with
him
i
dare
say
i
like
your
sketch
of
lord
clanmurray
and
your
picture
of
the
two
poor
young
girls
enjoyment
is
very
good
i
have
not
yet
noticed
julian
serious
conversation
with
cecilia
but
i
like
it
exceedingly
what
he
says
about
the
madness
of
otherwise
sensible
women
on
the
subject
of
their
daughters
coming
out
is
worth
its
weight
in
gold
i
do
not
see
that
the
language
sinks
pray
go
on
september
we
have
been
very
much
amused
by
your
three
books
but
i
have
a
good
many
criticisms
to
make
more
than
you
will
like
we
are
not
satisfied
with
forester
settling
herself
as
tenant
and
near
neighbour
to
such
a
man
as
sir
without
having
some
other
inducement
to
go
there
she
ought
to
have
some
friend
living
thereabouts
to
tempt
her
a
woman
going
with
two
girls
just
growing
up
into
a
neighbourhood
where
she
knows
nobody
but
one
man
of
not
very
good
character
is
an
awkwardness
which
so
prudent
a
woman
as
would
not
be
likely
to
fall
into
remember
she
is
very
prudent
you
must
not
let
her
act
inconsistently
give
her
a
friend
and
let
that
friend
be
invited
to
meet
her
at
the
priory
and
we
shall
have
no
objection
to
her
dining
there
as
she
does
but
otherwise
a
woman
in
her
situation
would
hardly
go
there
before
she
had
been
visited
by
other
families
i
like
the
scene
itself
the
miss
lesleys
lady
anne
and
the
music
very
much
sir
thomas
you
always
do
very
well
i
have
only
taken
the
liberty
of
expunging
one
phrase
of
his
which
would
not
be
allowable
my
heart
it
is
too
familiar
and
inelegant
your
grandmother
is
more
disturbed
at
not
returning
the
egertons
visit
sooner
than
by
anything
else
they
ought
to
have
called
at
the
parsonage
before
sunday
you
describe
a
sweet
place
but
your
descriptions
are
often
more
minute
than
will
be
liked
you
give
too
many
particulars
of
right
hand
and
left
forester
is
not
careful
enough
of
susan
health
susan
ought
not
to
be
walking
out
so
soon
after
heavy
rains
taking
long
walks
in
the
dirt
an
anxious
mother
would
not
suffer
it
i
like
your
susan
very
much
indeed
she
is
a
sweet
creature
her
playfulness
of
fancy
is
very
delightful
i
like
her
as
she
is
now
exceedingly
but
i
am
not
quite
so
well
satisfied
with
her
behaviour
to
george
at
first
she
seems
all
over
attachment
and
feeling
and
afterwards
to
have
none
at
all
she
is
so
extremely
composed
at
the
ball
and
so
well
satisfied
apparently
with
morgan
she
seems
to
have
changed
her
character
you
are
now
collecting
your
people
delightfully
getting
them
exactly
into
such
a
spot
as
is
the
delight
of
my
life
three
or
four
families
in
a
country
village
is
the
very
thing
to
work
on
and
i
hope
you
will
write
a
great
deal
more
and
make
full
use
of
them
while
they
are
so
very
favourably
arranged
you
are
but
coming
to
the
heart
and
beauty
of
your
book
till
the
heroine
grows
up
the
fun
must
be
imperfect
but
i
expect
a
great
deal
of
entertainment
from
the
next
three
or
four
books
and
i
hope
you
will
not
resent
these
remarks
by
sending
me
no
more
they
are
not
so
much
like
the
papillons
as
i
expected
your
last
chapter
is
very
entertaining
the
conversation
on
genius
julian
and
susan
both
talk
in
character
and
very
well
in
some
former
parts
cecilia
is
perhaps
a
little
too
solemn
and
good
but
upon
the
whole
her
disposition
is
very
well
opposed
to
susan
her
want
of
imagination
is
very
natural
i
wish
you
could
make
forester
talk
more
but
she
must
be
difficult
to
manage
and
make
entertaining
because
there
is
so
much
good
common
sense
and
propriety
about
her
that
nothing
can
be
made
very
her
economy
and
her
ambition
must
not
be
staring
the
papers
left
by
fisher
are
very
good
of
course
one
guesses
something
i
hope
when
you
have
written
a
great
deal
more
you
will
be
equal
to
scratching
out
some
of
the
past
the
scene
with
mellish
i
should
condemn
it
is
prosy
and
nothing
to
the
purpose
and
indeed
the
more
you
can
find
in
your
heart
to
curtail
between
dawlish
and
newton
priors
the
better
i
think
it
will
be
one
does
not
care
for
girls
till
they
are
grown
up
your
aunt
quite
enters
into
the
exquisiteness
of
that
name
newton
priors
is
really
a
nonpareil
milton
would
have
given
his
eyes
to
have
thought
of
it
is
not
the
cottage
taken
from
tollard
royal
september
i
hope
you
do
not
depend
on
having
your
book
again
immediately
i
kept
it
that
your
grandmama
may
hear
it
for
it
has
not
been
possible
yet
to
have
any
public
reading
i
have
read
it
to
your
aunt
cassandra
however
in
our
own
room
at
night
while
we
undressed
and
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
we
like
the
first
chapter
extremely
with
only
a
little
doubt
whether
lady
helena
is
not
almost
too
foolish
the
matrimonial
dialogue
is
very
good
certainly
i
like
susan
as
well
as
ever
and
begin
now
not
to
care
at
all
about
cecilia
she
may
stay
at
easton
court
as
long
as
she
likes
henry
mellish
i
am
afraid
will
be
too
much
in
the
common
novel
style
a
handsome
amiable
unexceptionable
young
man
such
as
do
not
much
abound
in
real
life
desperately
in
love
and
all
in
vain
but
i
have
no
business
to
judge
him
so
early
we
feel
really
obliged
to
you
for
introducing
a
lady
kenrick
it
will
remove
the
greatest
fault
in
the
work
and
i
give
you
credit
for
considerable
forbearance
as
an
author
in
adopting
so
much
of
our
opinion
i
expect
high
fun
about
fisher
and
sir
thomas
devereux
forester
being
ruined
by
his
vanity
is
extremely
good
but
i
wish
you
would
not
let
him
plunge
into
a
of
dissipation
i
do
not
object
to
the
thing
but
i
can
not
bear
the
expression
it
is
such
thorough
novel
slang
and
so
old
that
i
dare
say
adam
met
with
it
in
the
first
novel
he
opened
walter
scott
has
no
business
to
write
novels
especially
good
ones
it
is
not
fair
he
has
fame
and
profit
enough
as
a
poet
and
should
not
be
taking
the
bread
out
of
other
people
mouths
i
do
not
like
him
and
do
not
mean
to
like
if
i
can
help
it
but
fear
i
must
i
am
quite
determined
however
not
to
be
pleased
with
west
de
should
i
ever
meet
with
it
which
i
hope
i
shall
not
i
think
i
be
stout
against
anything
written
by
mrs
west
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
like
no
novels
really
but
miss
edgeworth
yours
and
my
own
what
can
you
do
with
egerton
to
increase
the
interest
for
him
i
wish
you
could
contrive
something
some
family
occurrence
to
bring
out
his
good
qualities
more
some
distress
among
brothers
and
sisters
to
relieve
by
the
sale
of
his
curacy
something
to
carry
him
mysteriously
away
and
then
be
heard
of
at
york
or
edinburgh
in
an
old
great
coat
i
would
not
seriously
recommend
anything
improbable
but
if
you
could
invent
something
spirited
for
him
it
would
have
a
good
effect
he
might
lend
all
his
money
to
captain
morris
but
then
he
would
be
a
great
fool
if
he
did
can
not
the
morrises
quarrel
and
he
reconcile
them
excuse
the
liberty
i
take
in
these
suggestions
the
webbs
are
really
gone
when
i
saw
the
wagons
at
the
door
and
thought
of
all
the
trouble
they
must
have
in
moving
i
began
to
reproach
myself
for
not
having
liked
them
better
but
since
the
wagons
have
disappeared
my
conscience
has
been
closed
again
and
i
am
excessively
glad
they
are
gone
i
am
very
fond
of
sherlock
sermons
and
prefer
them
to
almost
any
anna
marriage
took
place
on
november
her
husband
was
afterwards
a
clergyman
but
he
did
not
take
orders
until
about
three
years
after
the
marriage
and
the
first
home
of
the
young
couple
was
at
hendon
to
which
place
the
following
letter
was
addressed
jane
being
at
that
time
with
her
brother
henry
in
hans
place
hans
place
november
my
dear
anna
i
assure
you
we
all
came
away
very
much
pleased
with
our
visit
we
talked
of
you
for
about
a
mile
and
a
half
with
great
satisfaction
and
i
have
been
just
sending
a
very
good
report
of
you
to
miss
benn
with
a
full
account
of
your
dress
for
susan
and
maria
we
were
all
at
the
play
last
night
to
see
miss
in
i
do
not
think
she
was
quite
equal
to
my
expectations
i
fancy
i
want
something
more
than
can
be
i
took
two
but
had
very
little
occasion
for
either
she
is
an
elegant
creature
however
and
hugs
young
delightfully
i
am
going
this
morning
to
see
the
little
girls
in
keppel
street
cassy
was
excessively
interested
about
your
marriage
when
she
heard
of
it
which
was
not
until
she
was
to
drink
your
health
on
the
wedding
day
she
asked
a
thousand
questions
in
her
usual
manner
what
he
said
to
you
and
what
you
said
to
him
if
your
uncle
were
at
home
he
would
send
his
best
love
but
i
will
not
impose
any
base
fictitious
remembrances
on
you
mine
i
can
honestly
give
and
remain
your
affectionate
aunt
austen
early
in
december
anna
sent
her
aunt
another
packet
which
elicited
the
following
letter
hans
place
wednesday
my
dear
anna
i
have
been
very
far
from
finding
your
book
an
evil
i
assure
you
i
read
it
immediately
and
with
great
pleasure
i
think
you
are
going
on
very
well
the
description
of
griffin
and
lady
helena
unhappiness
is
very
good
just
what
was
likely
to
be
i
am
curious
to
know
what
the
end
of
will
be
the
name
of
newton
priors
is
really
invaluable
i
never
met
with
anything
superior
to
it
it
is
delightful
one
could
live
upon
the
name
of
newton
priors
for
a
twelvemonth
indeed
i
do
think
you
get
on
very
fast
i
only
wish
other
people
of
my
acquaintance
could
compose
as
rapidly
i
am
pleased
with
the
dog
scene
and
with
the
whole
of
george
and
love
but
am
more
particularly
struck
with
your
conversations
etc
they
are
very
good
throughout
julian
history
was
quite
a
surprise
to
me
you
had
not
very
long
known
it
yourself
i
suspect
but
i
have
no
objection
to
make
to
the
circumstance
and
it
is
very
well
told
his
having
been
in
love
with
the
aunt
gives
cecilia
an
additional
interest
with
him
i
like
the
idea
a
very
proper
compliment
to
an
aunt
i
rather
imagine
indeed
that
nieces
are
seldom
chosen
but
out
of
compliment
to
some
aunt
or
another
i
dare
say
ben
was
in
love
with
me
once
and
would
never
have
thought
of
you
if
he
had
not
supposed
me
dead
of
a
scarlet
fever
heathcote
writes
me
word
that
miss
blachford
is
married
but
i
have
never
seen
it
in
the
papers
and
one
may
as
well
be
single
if
the
wedding
is
not
to
be
in
print
your
affectionate
aunt
j
a
in
august
the
lefroys
moved
from
hendon
and
took
a
small
house
called
wyards
near
alton
and
within
a
walk
of
chawton
wyards
is
more
than
once
mentioned
in
our
letters
this
is
the
last
letter
we
possess
dealing
with
anna
story
and
we
can
understand
that
the
attention
of
either
writer
was
soon
diverted
from
it
by
more
serious
considerations
that
of
anna
by
family
cares
that
of
her
aunt
by
henry
illness
and
bankruptcy
and
by
her
own
publication
of
and
subsequent
failure
of
health
the
last
history
of
the
was
sad
enough
after
the
death
of
her
kind
critic
anna
could
not
induce
herself
to
go
on
with
the
tale
the
associations
were
too
melancholy
long
afterwards
she
took
it
out
of
its
drawer
and
in
a
fit
of
despondency
threw
it
into
the
fire
her
daughter
who
tells
us
this
adds
that
she
herself
a
little
girl
was
sitting
on
the
rug
and
remembers
that
she
watched
the
destruction
amused
with
the
flame
a
similar
fate
befell
a
tragedy
written
at
a
very
early
age
by
little
sister
caroline
who
was
her
junior
by
about
twelve
years
caroline
believed
it
to
be
a
necessary
part
of
a
tragedy
that
all
the
should
somehow
meet
their
end
by
violence
or
otherwise
in
the
last
act
and
this
belief
produced
such
a
scene
of
carnage
and
woe
as
to
cause
fits
of
laughter
among
unsympathetic
elders
and
tears
to
the
author
who
threw
the
unfortunate
tragedy
into
the
fire
on
the
spot
caroline
however
continued
to
write
stories
and
some
of
them
are
alluded
to
in
a
series
of
little
childish
letters
written
to
her
by
her
aunt
jane
which
survive
carefully
pieced
together
with
silver
paper
and
gum
and
which
are
worth
preserving
for
the
presence
in
them
of
love
and
playfulness
and
the
entire
absence
of
condescension
december
my
dear
caroline
i
wish
i
could
finish
stories
as
fast
as
you
can
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
sight
of
olivia
and
think
you
have
done
for
her
very
well
but
the
father
who
was
the
real
author
of
all
her
faults
and
sufferings
should
not
escape
unpunished
i
hope
hung
himself
or
took
the
of
or
underwent
some
direful
penance
or
other
yours
affectionately
austen
chawton
monday
july
my
dear
caroline
i
have
followed
your
directions
and
find
your
handwriting
admirable
if
you
continue
to
improve
as
much
as
you
have
done
perhaps
i
may
not
be
obliged
to
shut
my
eyes
at
all
half
a
year
hence
i
have
been
very
much
entertained
by
your
story
of
carolina
and
her
aged
father
it
made
me
laugh
heartily
and
i
am
particularly
glad
to
find
you
so
much
alive
upon
any
topic
of
such
absurdity
as
the
usual
description
of
a
heroine
father
you
have
done
it
full
justice
or
if
anything
be
wanting
it
is
the
information
of
the
venerable
old
man
having
married
when
only
and
being
a
father
at
i
had
an
early
opportunity
of
conveying
your
letter
to
mary
jane
having
only
to
throw
it
out
of
window
at
her
as
she
was
romping
with
your
brother
in
the
back
court
she
thanks
you
for
it
and
answers
your
questions
through
me
i
am
to
tell
you
that
she
has
passed
her
time
at
chawton
very
pleasantly
indeed
that
she
does
not
miss
cassy
so
much
as
she
expected
and
that
as
to
she
is
ashamed
to
say
it
has
never
been
worked
at
since
you
went
away
edward
visit
has
been
a
great
pleasure
to
us
he
has
not
lost
one
good
quality
or
good
look
and
is
only
altered
in
being
improved
by
being
some
months
older
than
when
we
saw
him
last
he
is
getting
very
near
our
own
age
for
do
not
grow
older
of
course

affectionately

wednesday
march
my
dear
caroline
i
am
very
glad
to
have
an
opportunity
of
answering
your
agreeable
little
letter
you
seem
to
be
quite
my
own
niece
in
your
feelings
towards
mme
de
genlis
i
do
not
think
i
could
even
now
at
my
sedate
time
of
life
read
et
without
being
in
a
rage
it
really
is
too
bad
not
allowing
them
to
be
happy
together
when
they
married
do
talk
of
it
pray
i
have
just
lent
your
aunt
frank
the
first
volume
of
veillées
du
for
mary
jane
to
read
it
will
be
some
time
before
she
comes
to
the
horror
of
olympe
i
had
a
very
nice
letter
from
your
brother
not
long
ago
and
i
am
quite
happy
to
see
how
much
his
hand
is
improving
i
am
convinced
that
it
will
end
in
a
very
gentlemanlike
hand
much
above
par
we
have
had
a
great
deal
of
fun
lately
with
stopping
at
the
door
three
times
within
a
few
days
we
had
a
couple
of
agreeable
visitors
turn
in
unexpectedly
your
uncle
henry
and
tilson
heathcote
and
miss
bigg
your
uncle
henry
and
seymour
take
notice
it
was
the
same
uncle
henry
each
time
i
remain
my
dear
caroline
your
affectionate
aunt
austen
hans
place
monday
night
october
my
dear
caroline
i
have
not
felt
quite
equal
to
taking
up
your
manuscript
but
think
i
shall
soon
and
i
hope
my
detaining
it
so
long
will
be
no
inconvenience
it
gives
us
great
pleasure
that
you
should
be
at
chawton
i
am
sure
cassy
must
be
delighted
to
have
you
you
will
practise
your
music
of
course
and
i
trust
to
you
for
taking
care
of
my
instrument
and
not
letting
it
be
in
any
respect
do
not
allow
anything
to
be
put
on
it
but
what
is
very
light
i
hope
you
will
try
to
make
out
some
other
tune
besides
the
hermit
i
am
sorry
you
got
wet
in
your
ride
now
that
you
are
become
an
aunt
you
are
a
person
of
some
consequence
and
must
excite
great
interest
whatever
you
do
i
have
always
maintained
the
importance
of
aunts
as
much
as
possible
and
i
am
sure
of
your
doing
the
same
now
believe
me
my
dear
yours
affectionately
austen
january
my
dear
caroline
i
am
always
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
writing
to
me
and
have
now
i
believe
two
or
three
notes
to
thank
you
for
but
whatever
may
be
their
number
i
mean
to
have
this
letter
accepted
as
a
handsome
return
for
all
for
you
see
i
have
taken
a
complete
whole
sheet
of
paper
which
is
to
entitle
me
to
consider
it
as
a
very
long
letter
whether
i
write
much
or
little
we
were
quite
happy
to
see
edward
it
was
an
unexpected
pleasure
and
he
makes
himself
as
agreeable
as
ever
sitting
in
such
a
quiet
comfortable
way
making
his
delightful
little
sketches
he
is
generally
thought
grown
since
he
was
here
last
and
rather
thinner
but
in
very
good
looks
he
read
his
two
chapters
to
us
the
first
evening
both
good
but
especially
the
last
in
our
opinion
we
think
it
has
more
of
the
spirit
and
entertainment
of
the
early
part
of
his
work
i
feel
myself
getting
stronger
than
i
was
half
a
year
ago
and
can
so
perfectly
well
walk
to
alton
back
again
without
the
slightest
fatigue
that
i
hope
to
be
able
to
do
both
when
summer
comes
i
spent
two
or
three
days
with
your
uncle
and
aunt
lately
and
though
the
children
are
sometimes
very
noisy
and
not
under
such
order
as
they
ought
and
easily
might
i
can
not
help
liking
them
and
even
loving
them
which
i
hope
may
be
not
wholly
inexcusable
in
their
and
your
affectionate
aunt
austen
the
pianoforte
often
talks
of
you
in
various
keys
tunes
and
expressions
i
allow
but
be
it
lesson
or
country
dance
sonata
or
waltz
are
really
its
constant
theme
i
wish
you
could
come
and
see
us
as
easily
as
edward
can
j
wednesday
night
you
send
me
great
news
indeed
my
dear
caroline
about
digweed
mr
trimmer
and
a
grand
pianoforte
i
wish
it
had
been
a
small
one
as
then
you
might
have
pretended
that
rooms
were
too
damp
to
be
fit
for
it
and
offered
to
take
charge
of
it
at
the
parsonage
i
look
forward
to
the
four
new
chapters
with
but
how
can
you
like
frederick
better
than
edgar
you
have
some
eccentric
tastes
however
i
know
as
to
heroes
and
heroines
goodbye
yours
affectionately
austen
chawton
wednesday
march
my
dear
caroline
pray
make
no
apologies
for
writing
to
me
often
i
am
always
very
happy
to
hear
from
you
i
think
you
very
much
improved
in
your
writing
and
in
the
way
to
write
a
very
pretty
hand
i
wish
you
could
practise
your
fingering
oftener
would
not
it
be
a
good
plan
for
you
to
go
and
live
entirely
at
wm
digweed
he
could
not
desire
any
other
remuneration
than
the
pleasure
of
hearing
you
practise
i
like
frederick
and
caroline
better
than
i
did
but
must
still
prefer
edgar
and
julia
julia
is
a
ingenuous
natural
girl
which
i
like
her
for
but
i
know
the
word
is
no
recommendation
to
you
how
very
well
edward
is
looking
you
can
have
nobody
in
your
neighbourhood
to
vie
with
him
at
all
except
portal
i
have
taken
one
ride
on
the
donkey
and
like
it
very
much
and
you
must
try
to
get
me
quiet
mild
days
that
i
may
be
able
to
go
out
pretty
constantly
a
great
deal
of
wind
does
not
suit
me
as
i
have
still
a
tendency
to
rheumatism
in
short
i
am
a
poor
honey
at
present
i
will
be
better
when
you
can
come
and
see
us
yours
affectionately
austen
caroline
austen
contributed
to
the
written
by
her
brother
many
of
the
personal
reminiscences
of
their
aunt
she
was
the
niece
to
whom
jane
in
her
last
illness
sent
a
recommendation
to
read
more
and
write
less
during
the
years
of
girlhood
caroline
obeyed
the
injunction
she
became
a
very
woman
and
never
wrote
stories
for
publication
she
was
however
an
admirable
talker
able
to
invest
common
things
with
a
point
and
spirit
peculiarly
her
own
she
was
also
an
ideal
aunt
both
to
nieces
and
nephews
who
all
owe
a
great
deal
to
her
companionship
and
devotion
footnotes
the
first
two
batches
of
letters
are
to
be
found
in
lord
brabourne
book
vol
ii
of
the
third
set
to
caroline
only
a
few
isolated
quotations
have
been
published
the
second
and
third
sets
have
been
compared
with
the
originals
but
we
have
been
unable
to
do
this
in
the
case
of
the
first
cassandra
was
evidently
not
in
the
secret
and
we
learn
from
their
niece
anna
the
interesting
fact
that
close
and
intimate
as
were
the
relations
between
the
two
sisters
they
were
absolutely
silent
to
each
other
when
the
confidences
of
a
third
person
had
to
be
guarded
perhaps
in
march
lord
brabourne
dates
them
in
and
oscar
fay
adams
and
miss
hill
naturally
follow
him
but
such
a
date
is
impossible
as
they
contain
allusions
to
two
or
three
family
events
which
had
not
then
happened
this
correction
makes
the
account
of
her
own
health
in
the
letters
of
march
and
march
which
will
be
found
in
chap
xx
fit
in
much
better
with
our
information
from
other
sources
as
to
the
progress
of
her
illness
than
would
have
been
the
case
had
it
been
written
in
see
in
it
must
be
remembered
that
there
was
no
portman
or
desborough
in
in
published

jane
austen
had
no
more
doubt

to
who

failing
health
during
the
last
year
of
jane
austen
life
when
her
health
was
gradually
failing
and
she
was
obliged
to
depend
ever
more
and
more
exclusively
on
her
immediate
family
for
society
she
had
at
least
the
satisfaction
of
having
her
two
sailor
brothers
nearer
at
hand
than
had
often
been
the
case
after
frank
return
from
the
baltic
early
in
nothing
occurred
of
a
more
serious
nature
than
the
great
naval
review
in
june
which
only
indirectly
affected
him
as
he
was
not
then
in
command
of
a
ship
to
prevent
his
attending
to
his
family
he
settled
down
to
a
domestic
life
with
wife
and
children
first
of
all
occupying
the
great
house
at
chawton
but
soon
moving
to
alton
charles
who
for
ten
years
had
had
active
but
unexciting
work
outside
the
theatre
of
war
now
came
more
to
the
front
commanding
the
frigate
he
operated
against
murat
when
that
eccentric
sovereign
took
part
with
napoleon
on
the
escape
of
the
latter
from
elba
charles
was
sent
in
pursuit
of
a
neapolitan
squadron
cruising
in
the
adriatic
and
subsequently
he
blockaded
brindisi
and
waited
for
the
garrison
to
hoist
the
white
flag
of
the
bourbons
later
on
he
was
kept
busy
with
greek
pirates
in
the
archipelago
until
the
was
lost
off
smyrna
in
when
he
returned
home
the
had
been
a
lucky
ship
admiral
halsted
having
made
his
fortune
in
her
but
her
luck
was
worn
out
when
she
went
down
the
pilot
was
on
board
no
lives
were
lost
and
no
blame
fell
on
the
captain
it
must
have
been
however
a
disappointing
end
to
an
exciting
time
and
as
the
war
was
over
it
might
be
long
before
he
got
another
ship
a
letter
from
charles
to
jane
during
this
command
written
from
palermo
may
furnishes
us
with
one
of
the
few
indications
that
exist
of
fame
achieved
by
her
during
her
lifetime
books
became
the
subject
of
conversation
and
i
praised
highly
when
a
young
man
present
observed
that
nothing
had
come
out
for
years
to
be
compared
with
and
and
as
i
am
sure
you
must
be
anxious
to
know
the
name
of
a
person
of
so
much
taste
i
shall
tell
you
it
is
fox
a
nephew
of
the
late
charles
james
fox
that
you
may
not
be
too
much
elated
at
this
morsel
of
praise
i
shall
add
that
he
did
not
appear
to
like
so
well
as
the
two
first
in
which
however
i
believe
he
is
singular
we
may
compare
this
account
with
the
quotation
given
in
the
from
sir
henry
holland
i
have
the
picture
before
me
still
of
lord
holland
lying
on
his
bed
when
attacked
with
gout
his
admirable
sister
miss
fox
reading
aloud
as
she
always
did
on
these
occasions
some
one
of
miss
austen
novels
of
which
he
was
never
wearied
it
is
as
difficult
to
follow
the
various
stages
of
jane
illness
as
it
is
to
understand
the
exact
nature
of
her
complaint
she
must
have
begun
to
feel
her
malady
early
in
the
year
for
some
friends
at
a
distance
whom
she
visited
in
the
spring
that
her
health
was
somewhat
impaired
and
observed
that
she
went
about
her
old
haunts
and
recalled
the
old
recollections
connected
with
them
in
a
particular
manner
as
if
she
did
not
expect
ever
to
see
them
again
this
is
however
almost
the
only
indication
that
we
have
of
any
diminution
of
vigour
at
that
time
for
the
three
letters
to
fanny
knight
given
by
lord
brabourne
as
written
in
must
be
transferred
to
and
so
must
the
two
short
extracts
on
pp
of
the
as
they
evidently
refer
to
a
family
event
which
occurred
in
the
march
of
the
later
year
the
tone
of
her
letters
through
the
remainder
of
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
next
year
was
almost
invariably
cheerful
and
she
showed
by
the
completion
of
that
she
was
capable
of
literary
work
during
the
summer
of
the
fact
is
that
as
to
health
she
was
an
incurable
optimist
her
natural
good
spirits
made
her
see
the
best
side
and
her
unselfishness
prompted
the
suppression
of
anything
that
might
distress
those
around
her
nothing
for
instance
could
be
more
lively
than
the
following
letter
to
edward
austen
written
while
he
was
still
at
winchester
school
but
had
come
home
for
his
last
summer
holidays
chawton
july
my
dear
edward
many
thanks
a
thank
for
every
line
and
as
many
to
digweed
for
coming
we
have
been
wanting
very
much
to
hear
of
your
mother
and
are
happy
to
find
she
continues
to
mend
but
her
illness
must
have
been
a
very
serious
one
indeed
when
she
is
really
recovered
she
ought
to
try
change
of
air
and
come
over
to
us
tell
your
father
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
him
for
his
share
of
your
letter
and
most
sincerely
join
in
the
hope
of
her
being
eventually
much
the
better
for
her
present
discipline
she
has
the
comfort
moreover
of
being
confined
in
such
weather
as
gives
one
little
temptation
to
be
out
it
is
really
too
bad
and
has
been
too
bad
for
a
long
time
much
worse
than
anybody
bear
and
i
begin
to
think
it
will
never
be
fine
again
this
is
a
of
mine
for
i
have
often
observed
that
if
one
writes
about
the
weather
it
is
generally
completely
changed
before
the
letter
is
read
i
wish
it
may
prove
so
now
and
that
when
digweed
reaches
steventon
he
may
find
you
have
had
a
long
series
of
hot
dry
weather
we
are
a
small
party
at
present
only
grandmamma
mary
jane
and
myself
yalden
coach
cleared
off
the
rest
yesterday
i
am
glad
you
recollected
to
mention
your
being
come
home
my
heart
began
to
sink
within
me
when
i
had
got
so
far
through
your
letter
without
its
being
mentioned
i
was
dreadfully
afraid
that
you
might
be
detained
at
winchester
by
severe
illness
confined
to
your
bed
perhaps
and
quite
unable
to
hold
a
pen
and
only
dating
from
steventon
in
order
with
a
mistaken
sort
of
tenderness
to
deceive
me
but
now
i
have
no
doubt
of
your
being
at
home
i
am
sure
you
would
not
say
it
so
seriously
unless
it
actually
were
so
we
saw
a
countless
number
of
full
of
boys
pass
by
yesterday
morning
full
of
future
heroes
legislators
fools
and
villains
you
have
never
thanked
me
for
my
last
letter
which
went
by
the
cheese
i
can
not
bear
not
to
be
thanked
you
will
not
pay
us
a
visit
yet
of
course
we
must
not
think
of
it
your
mother
must
get
well
first
and
you
must
go
to
oxford
and
be
elected
after
that
a
little
change
of
scene
may
be
good
for
you
and
your
physicians
i
hope
will
order
you
to
the
sea
or
to
a
house
by
the
side
of
a
very
considerable
pond
oh
it
rains
again
it
beats
against
the
window
mary
jane
and
i
have
been
wet
through
once
already
we
set
off
in
the
for
farringdon
as
i
wanted
to
see
the
improvements
woolls
is
making
but
we
were
obliged
to
turn
back
before
we
got
there
but
not
soon
enough
to
avoid
a
pelter
all
the
way
home
we
met
woolls
i
talked
of
its
being
bad
weather
for
the
hay
and
he
returned
me
the
comfort
of
its
being
much
worse
for
the
wheat
we
hear
that
does
not
quit
tangier
why
and
wherefore
do
you
know
that
our
browning
is
gone
you
must
prepare
for
a
william
when
you
come
a
lad
civil
and
quiet
and
seeming
likely
to
do
good
bye
i
am
sure
will
be
astonished
at
my
writing
so
much
for
the
paper
is
so
thin
that
he
will
be
able
to
count
the
lines
if
not
to
read
them
yours

austen
there
was
a
second
family
visit
this
year
to
cheltenham
where
cassandra
and
jane
had
already
been
in
the
spring
probably
their
connexion
with
this
was
through
james
austen
and
was
through
her
sister
fowle
of
kintbury
fowle
had
lived
at
elkstone
near
cheltenham
and
continued
to
hold
that
benefice
which
was
in
the
gift
of
the
craven
family
the
fowles
would
naturally
renew
their
intercourse
with
their
old
friends
in
the
neighbourhood
and
would
go
to
see
his
curate
and
acquaint
himself
with
the
circumstances
of
his
parish
the
visits
to
gloucestershire
were
therefore
for
pleasure
and
business
as
well
as
health
in
august
it
was
a
recent
serious
illness
of
james
austen
which
took
the
party
there
austen
being
accompanied
by
her
daughter
caroline
and
her
cassandra
meanwhile
jane
remained
with
her
mother
at
chawton
where
she
had
edward
austen
as
a
visitor
during
cassandra
absence
jane
wrote
to
her
as
follows
chawton
september
we
go
on
very
well
here
edward
is
a
great
pleasure
to
me
he
drove
me
to
alton
yesterday
i
went
principally
to
carry
news
of
you
and
henry
and
made
a
regular
handsome
visit
staying
there
while
edward
went
on
to
wyards
with
an
invitation
to
dinner
it
was
declined
and
will
be
so
again
probably
for
i
really
believe
anna
is
not
equal
to
the
fatigue
the
alton
four
drank
tea
with
us
last
night
and
we
were
very
pleasant
jeu
de
violon
all
new
to
sweney
and
he
entered
into
it
very
well
it
was
a
renewal
of
former
agreeable
evenings
we
all
except
my
mother
dine
at
alton
and
perhaps
may
have
some
of
the
same
sports
again
but
i
do
not
think
and
will
add
much
to
our
wit
edward
is
writing
a
novel
we
have
all
heard
what
he
has
written
it
is
extremely
clever
written
with
great
ease
and
spirit
if
he
can
carry
it
on
in
the
same
way
it
will
be
a
work
and
in
a
style
i
think
to
be
popular
pray
tell
mary
how
much
i
admire
it
and
tell
caroline
that
i
think
it
is
hardly
fair
upon
her
and
myself
to
have
him
take
up
the
novel
line
sunday
september
my
dearest
cassandra
i
have
borne
the
arrival
of
your
letter
extremely
well
anybody
might
have
thought
it
was
giving
me
pleasure
i
am
very
glad
you
find
so
much
to
be
satisfied
with
at
cheltenham
while
the
waters
agree
everything
else
is
trifling
our
day
at
alton
was
very
pleasant
venison
quite
right
children
and
and
digweed
taking
kindly
to
our
charades
and
other
games
i
must
also
observe
for
his
satisfaction
that
edward
at
my
suggestion
devoted
himself
very
properly
to
the
entertainment
of
miss
gibson
nothing
was
wanting
except
sweney
but
he
alas
had
been
ordered
away
to
london
the
day
before
we
had
a
beautiful
walk
home
by
moonlight
thank
you
my
back
has
given
me
scarcely
any
pain
for
many
days
i
have
an
idea
that
agitation
does
it
as
much
harm
as
fatigue
and
that
i
was
ill
at
the
time
of
your
going
from
the
very
circumstance
of
your
going
i
am
nursing
myself
up
now
into
as
beautiful
a
state
as
i
can
because
i
hear
that
white
means
to
call
on
me
before
he
leaves
the
country
i
have
not
seen
anna
since
the
day
you
left
us
her
father
and
brother
visited
her
most
days
edward
and
ben
called
here
on
thursday
edward
was
in
his
way
to
selborne
we
found
him
very
agreeable
he
is
come
back
from
france
thinking
of
the
french
as
one
could
wish
disappointed
in
everything
he
did
not
go
beyond
paris
i
have
a
letter
from
perigord
she
and
her
mother
are
in
london
again
she
speaks
of
france
as
a
scene
of
general
poverty
and
misery
no
money
no
trade
nothing
to
be
got
but
by
the
innkeepers
and
as
to
her
own
present
prospects
she
is
not
much
less
melancholy
than
before
i
enjoyed
edward
company
very
much
as
i
said
before
and
yet
i
was
not
sorry
when
friday
came
it
had
been
a
busy
week
and
i
wanted
a
few
quiet
and
exemption
from
the
thought
and
contrivancy
which
any
sort
of
company
gives
i
often
wonder
how
can
find
time
for
what
you
do
in
addition
to
the
care
of
the
house
and
how
good
west
could
have
written
such
books
and
collected
so
many
hard
words
with
all
her
family
cares
is
still
more
a
matter
of
astonishment
composition
seems
to
me
impossible
with
a
head
full
of
joints
of
mutton
and
doses
of
rhubarb
we
do
not
much
like
cooper
new
sermons
they
are
fuller
of
regeneration
and
conversion
than
ever
with
the
addition
of
his
zeal
in
the
cause
of
the
bible
society
this
is
the
last
letter
which
we
have
from
jane
to
cassandra
probably
the
sisters
were
not
parted
again
except
when
cassandra
went
for
a
few
days
to
scarlets
on
the
death
of
their
uncle
leigh
perrot
at
the
end
of
the
following
march
and
if
jane
wrote
then
it
must
have
been
in
such
depression
of
mind
and
weakness
of
body
that
her
sister
would
not
have
preserved
the
writing
for
others
to
see
in
the
meanwhile
the
autumn
of
was
probably
occupied
with
the
preparation
of
for
the
press
and
on
the
whole
we
should
gather
from
the
evidence
before
us
that
the
earlier
part
of
the
winter
saw
one
of
those
fallacious
instances
of
temporary
improvement
which
so
often
deceive
nurses
and
patients
alike
in
cases
of
internal
complaints
have
certainly
gained
strength
through
the
winter
she
says
on
january
on
the
feel
myself
stronger
than
i
was
half
a
year
ago
and
it
was
in
this
spirit
of
hopefulness
that
she
had
written
the
following
lively
letter
to
edward
austen
when
he
had
left
winchester
and
was
about
to
enter
on
the
career
of
an
oxford
undergraduate
chawton
monday
december
my
dear
edward
one
reason
for
my
writing
to
you
now
is
that
i
may
have
the
pleasure
of
directing
to
you
re
i
give
you
joy
of
having
left
winchester
now
you
may
own
how
miserable
you
were
there
now
it
will
gradually
all
come
out
your
crimes
and
your
miseries
how
often
you
went
up
by
the
mail
to
london
and
threw
away
fifty
guineas
at
a
tavern
and
how
often
you
were
on
the
point
of
hanging
yourself
restrained
only
as
some
aspersion
upon
poor
old
winton
has
it
by
the
want
of
a
tree
within
some
miles
of
the
city
charles
knight
and
his
companions
passed
through
chawton
about
this
morning
later
than
it
used
to
be
uncle
henry
and
i
had
a
glimpse
of
his
handsome
face
looking
all
health
and
good
humour
i
wonder
when
you
will
come
and
see
us
i
know
what
i
rather
speculate
upon
but
shall
say
nothing
we
think
uncle
henry
in
excellent
looks
look
at
him
this
moment
and
think
so
too
if
you
have
not
done
it
before
and
we
have
the
great
comfort
of
seeing
decided
improvement
in
uncle
charles
both
as
to
health
spirits
and
appearance
and
they
are
each
of
them
so
agreeable
in
their
different
way
and
harmonise
so
well
that
their
visit
is
thorough
enjoyment
uncle
henry
writes
very
superior
sermons
you
and
i
must
try
to
get
hold
of
one
or
two
and
put
them
into
our
novels
it
would
be
a
fine
help
to
a
volume
and
we
could
make
our
heroine
read
it
aloud
of
a
sunday
evening
just
as
well
as
isabella
wardour
in
is
made
to
read
the
of
the
hartz
in
the
ruins
of
ruth
though
i
believe
upon
recollection
lovell
is
the
reader
by
the
bye
my
dear
edward
i
am
quite
concerned
for
the
loss
your
mother
mentions
in
her
letter
two
chapters
and
a
half
to
be
missing
is
monstrous
it
is
well
that
have
not
been
at
steventon
lately
and
therefore
can
not
be
suspected
of
purloining
them
two
strong
twigs
and
a
half
towards
a
nest
of
my
own
would
have
been
something
i
do
not
think
however
that
any
theft
of
that
sort
would
be
really
very
useful
to
me
what
should
i
do
with
your
strong
manly
spirited
sketches
full
of
variety
and
glow
how
could
i
possibly
join
them
on
to
the
little
bit
two
inches
wide
of
ivory
on
which
i
work
with
so
fine
a
brush
as
produces
little
effect
after
much
labour
you
will
hear
from
uncle
henry
how
well
anna
is
she
seems
perfectly
recovered
ben
was
here
on
saturday
to
ask
uncle
charles
and
me
to
dine
with
them
as
but
i
was
forced
to
decline
it
the
walk
is
beyond
my
strength
though
i
am
otherwise
very
well
and
this
is
not
a
season
for
and
as
we
do
not
like
to
spare
uncle
charles
he
has
declined
it
too
ah
ha
edward
i
doubt
your
seeing
uncle
henry
at
steventon
the
weather
will
prevent
your
expecting
him
i
think
tell
your
father
with
aunt
cass
love
and
mine
that
the
pickled
cucumbers
are
extremely
good
and
tell
him
also
him
what
you
will
no
do
tell
him
what
you
will
but
tell
him
that
grandmamma
begs
him
to
make
joseph
hall
pay
his
rent
if
he
can
you
must
not
be
tired
of
reading
the
word
for
i
have
not
done
with
it
uncle
charles
thanks
your
mother
for
her
letter
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
him
to
know
the
parcel
was
received
and
gave
so
much
satisfaction
and
he
begs
her
to
be
so
good
as
to
give
three
shillings
for
him
to
dame
staples
which
shall
be
allowed
for
in
the
payment
of
her
debt
here
i
am
happy
to
tell
you
that
papillon
will
soon
make
his
offer
probably
next
monday
as
he
returns
on
saturday
his
can
no
longer
be
doubtful
in
the
smallest
degree
as
he
has
secured
the
refusal
of
the
house
which
baverstock
at
present
occupies
in
chawton
and
is
to
vacate
soon
which
is
of
course
intended
for
elizabeth
papillon
adieu
amiable
i
hope
caroline
behaves
well
to
you
yours
ly
austen

esq
the
same
bright
tone
pervades
the
following
letter
to
alethea
bigg
from
which
one
of
the
remarks
quoted
above
as
to
the
improvement
of
her
health
is
taken
chawton
january
my
dear
alethea
i
think
it
time
there
should
be
a
little
writing
between
us
though
i
believe
the
epistolary
debt
is
on
side
and
i
hope
this
will
find
all
the
streatham
party
well
neither
carried
away
by
the
flood
nor
rheumatic
through
the
damps
such
mild
weather
is
you
know
delightful
to
and
though
we
have
a
great
many
ponds
and
a
fine
running
stream
through
the
meadows
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
it
is
nothing
but
what
beautifies
us
and
does
to
talk
of
have
certainly
gained
strength
through
the
winter
and
am
not
far
from
being
well
and
i
think
i
understand
my
own
case
now
so
much
better
than
i
did
as
to
be
able
by
care
to
keep
off
any
serious
return
of
illness
i
am
more
and
more
convinced
that
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
i
have
suffered
which
makes
it
easy
to
know
how
to
treat
myself
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
thus
much
of
me
i
am
sure
we
have
just
had
a
few
days
visit
from
edward
who
brought
us
a
good
account
of
his
father
and
the
very
circumstance
of
his
coming
at
all
of
his
father
being
able
to
spare
him
is
itself
a
good
account
he
grows
still
and
still
improves
in
appearance
at
least
in
the
estimation
of
his
aunts
who
love
him
better
and
better
as
they
see
the
sweet
temper
and
warm
affections
of
the
boy
confirmed
in
the
young
man
i
tried
hard
to
persuade
him
that
he
must
have
some
message
for
william
but
in
vain
this
is
not
a
time
of
year
for
and
our
donkeys
are
necessarily
having
so
long
a
run
of
luxurious
idleness
that
i
suppose
we
shall
find
they
have
forgotten
much
of
their
education
when
we
use
them
again
we
do
not
use
two
at
once
however
do
imagine
such
excesses
our
own
new
clergyman
is
expected
here
very
soon
perhaps
in
time
to
assist
papillon
on
sunday
i
shall
be
very
glad
when
the
first
hearing
is
over
it
will
be
a
nervous
hour
for
our
pew
though
we
hear
that
he
acquits
himself
with
as
much
ease
and
collectedness
as
if
he
had
been
used
to
it
all
his
life
we
have
no
chance
we
know
of
seeing
you
between
streatham
and
winchester
you
go
the
other
road
and
are
engaged
to
two
or
three
houses
if
there
should
be
any
change
however
you
know
how
welcome
you
would
be
we
have
been
reading
the
pilgrimage
to
and
generally
with
much
approbation
nothing
will
please
all
the
world
you
know
but
parts
of
it
suit
me
better
than
much
that
he
has
written
before
the
opening
i
believe
he
calls
it
is
very
beautiful
poor
man
one
can
not
but
grieve
for
the
loss
of
the
son
so
fondly
described
has
he
at
all
recovered
it
what
do
and
hill
know
about
his
present
state
yours
ly
austen
the
real
object
of
this
letter
is
to
ask
you
for
a
receipt
but
i
thought
it
genteel
not
to
let
it
appear
early
we
remember
some
excellent
orange
wine
at
manydown
made
from
seville
oranges
entirely
or
chiefly
i
should
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
receipt
if
you
can
command
it
within
a
few
weeks
three
days
later
jane
felt
well
enough
to
set
to
work
on
a
fresh
novel
thoroughly
fresh
for
it
bore
no
resemblance
to
any
of
her
previous
stories
a
short
of
this
beginning
is
given
in
the
and
from
it
the
reader
will
see
that
the
scene
is
laid
at
a
new
which
is
being
exploited
by
two
of
the
leading
characters
in
the
twelve
chapters
which
she
wrote
the
are
sketched
in
with
vigour
and
decision
but
there
is
little
of
the
subtle
refinement
which
we
are
accustomed
to
associate
with
her
work
and
certainly
nothing
of
the
tender
sentiment
of
it
is
unfair
however
to
judge
from
the
first
draft
of
a
few
introductory
chapters
written
as
they
no
doubt
were
to
relieve
the
tedium
of
long
hours
of
confinement
and
written
perhaps
also
to
comfort
her
friends
by
letting
them
see
that
she
was
still
able
to
work
it
is
probable
too
that
a
long
step
in
the
downward
progress
of
her
condition
was
taken
in
the
course
of
the
seven
weeks
during
which
she
was
writing
for
the
last
time
it
began
her
usual
firm
and
neat
hand
but
some
of
the
latter
pages
were
first
traced
in
pencil
probably
when
she
was
too
ill
to
sit
long
at
a
desk
and
afterwards
written
over
in
ink
the
last
date
on
the
is
march
she
was
no
doubt
by
this
time
making
frequent
use
of
the
temporary
couch
which
as
we
are
told
she
had
contrived
out
of
two
or
three
chairs
so
as
to
leave
the
one
real
sofa
free
for
her
mother
she
professed
to
like
her
own
couch
best
but
the
importunity
of
a
young
niece
obliged
her
to
confess
that
she
used
it
always
because
she
thought
that
her
mother
would
not
use
the
sofa
enough
unless
it
were
absolutely
reserved
for
her
service
in
february
and
march
followed
the
three
letters
written
to
fanny
knight
portions
of
which
are
given
in
the
last
chapter
they
chiefly
concern
fanny
own
affairs
and
show
how
lively
jane
mind
still
was
and
with
what
unselfish
care
she
could
divert
it
from
her
own
sufferings
to
the
concerns
which
interested
those
nearest
to
her
we
now
append
the
sentences
in
those
letters
which
refer
to
her
own
state
of
health
and
which
certainly
read
as
if
some
serious
accession
of
illness
had
intervened
while
the
correspondence
was
in
progress
i
am
almost
entirely
cured
of
my
rheumatism
just
a
little
pain
in
my
knee
now
and
then
to
make
me
remember
what
it
was
and
keep
on
flannel
aunt
cassandra
nursed
me
so
beautifully
i
am
got
tolerably
well
again
quite
equal
to
walking
about
and
enjoying
the
air
and
by
sitting
down
and
resting
a
good
while
between
my
walks
i
get
exercise
enough
i
have
a
scheme
however
for
accomplishing
more
as
the
weather
grows
i
mean
to
take
to
riding
the
donkey
it
will
be
more
independent
and
less
troublesome
than
the
use
of
the
carriage
and
i
shall
be
able
to
go
about
with
aunt
cassandra
in
her
walks
to
alton
and
wyards
many
thanks
for
your
kind
care
of
my
health
i
certainly
have
not
been
well
for
many
weeks
and
about
a
week
ago
i
was
very
poorly
i
have
had
a
good
deal
of
fever
at
times
and
indifferent
nights
but
i
am
considerably
better
now
and
am
recovering
my
looks
a
little
which
have
been
bad
enough
black
and
white
and
every
wrong
colour
i
must
not
depend
upon
being
ever
very
blooming
again
sickness
is
a
dangerous
indulgence
at
my
time
of
life
i
was
languid
and
dull
and
very
bad
company
when
i
wrote
the
above
i
am
better
now
to
my
own
feelings
at
least
and
wish
i
may
be
more
agreeable
we
are
going
to
have
rain
and
after
that
very
pleasant
genial
weather
which
will
exactly
do
for
me
as
my
saddle
will
then
be
completed
and
air
and
exercise
is
what
i
want
i
took
my
first
ride
yesterday
and
liked
it
very
much
i
went
up
mounter
lane
and
round
by
where
the
new
cottages
are
to
be
and
found
the
exercise
and
everything
very
pleasant
and
i
had
the
advantage
of
agreeable
companions
as
aunt
cass
and
edward
walked
by
my
side
aunt
cass
is
such
an
excellent
nurse
so
assiduous
and
unwearied
but
you
know
all
that
already
at
the
end
of
march
she
made
her
will
a
brief
and
simple
document
of
which
the
operative
part
was
in
these
words
my
dearest
sister
cassandra
elizabeth
everything
of
which
i
may
die
possessed
or
which
may
hereafter
be
due
to
me
subject
to
the
payment
of
my
funeral
expenses
and
to
a
legacy
of
to
my
brother
henry
and
to
madame
bigeon
about
the
same
time
another
will
was
causing
great
disappointment
to
the
austen
family
and
as
jane
was
affected
by
anything
that
affected
her
nearest
relations
we
must
probably
attribute
to
it
some
share
in
the
rapid
decay
of
her
bodily
strength
her
uncle
leigh
perrot
died
at
scarlets
on
march
he
was
childless
and
left
a
considerable
fortune
as
he
was
also
a
man
and
had
always
shown
particular
favour
to
the
austens
it
was
reasonably
expected
that
they
would
reap
some
immediate
benefit
under
his
will
most
of
the
family
were
in
narrow
circumstances
and
they
had
lately
been
crippled
by
the
failure
of
henry
business
and
the
lawsuit
about
edward
hampshire
property
a
legacy
therefore
would
have
been
very
acceptable
leigh
perrot
however
was
actuated
in
making
his
will
by
a
stronger
motive
than
love
to
sister
and
nephews
he
was
devoted
to
his
wife
and
was
perhaps
anxious
to
show
that
his
devotion
was
increased
in
consequence
of
the
false
accusation
with
which
she
had
been
assailed
at
bath
in
he
showed
it
by
leaving
everything
to
her
for
her
life
and
placing
scarlets
and
a
considerable
sum
at
her
free
disposal
at
the
same
time
he
left
a
large
sum
subject
to
her
life
interest
to
james
austen
and
his
heirs
and
apiece
to
of
austen
children
who
should
survive
his
wife
leigh
perrot
also
at
a
later
date
gave
allowances
to
some
members
of
the
family
and
eventually
made
edward
austen
her
heir
none
of
these
advantages
however
fell
to
them
immediately
and
the
disappointment
caused
by
their
uncle
disposition
of
his
property
is
reflected
in
the
following
letter
from
jane
to
her
brother
charles
april
my
dearest
charles
many
thanks
for
your
affectionate
letter
i
was
in
your
debt
before
but
i
have
really
been
too
unwell
the
last
fortnight
to
write
anything
that
was
not
absolutely
necessary
i
have
been
suffering
from
a
bilious
attack
attended
with
a
good
deal
of
fever
a
few
days
ago
my
complaint
appeared
removed
but
i
am
ashamed
to
say
that
the
shock
of
my
will
brought
on
a
relapse
and
i
was
so
ill
on
friday
and
thought
myself
so
likely
to
be
worse
that
i
could
not
but
press
for
returning
with
frank
after
the
funeral
last
night
which
she
of
course
did
and
either
her
return
or
my
having
seen
curtis
or
my
chusing
to
go
away
have
made
me
better
this
morning
i
live
upstairs
however
for
the
present
and
am
coddled
i
am
the
only
one
of
the
legatees
who
has
been
so
silly
but
a
weak
body
must
excuse
weak
nerves
my
mother
has
borne
the
forgetfulness
of
extremely
well
her
expectations
for
herself
were
never
beyond
the
extreme
of
moderation
and
she
thinks
with
you
that
my
uncle
always
looked
forward
to
surviving
her
she
desires
her
best
love
and
many
thanks
for
your
kind
feelings
and
heartily
wishes
that
her
younger
children
had
more
and
all
her
children
something
immediately
nothing
can
be
kinder
than
cooke
enquiries
after
you
and
harriet
in
all
her
letters
and
there
was
no
standing
her
affectionate
way
of
speaking
of
countenance
after
her
seeing
you
god
bless
you
all
conclude
me
to
be
going
on
well
if
you
hear
nothing
to
the
contrary
yours
ever
truly
j
a
tell
dear
harriet
that
whenever
she
wants
me
in
her
service
again
she
must
send
a
hackney
chariot
all
the
way
for
me
for
i
am
not
strong
enough
to
travel
any
other
way
and
i
hope
cassy
will
take
care
that
it
is
a
green
one
we
will
end
this
chapter
with
caroline
austen
account
of
her
last
visit
to
her
aunt
jane
which
occurred
about
this
time
it
had
been
settled
that
about
the
end
of
march
or
the
beginning
of
april
i
should
spend
a
few
days
at
chawton
in
the
absence
of
my
father
and
mother
who
were
just
then
engaged
with
leigh
perrot
in
arranging
her
late
affairs
but
aunt
jane
became
too
ill
to
have
me
in
the
house
and
so
i
went
instead
to
my
sister
lefroy
at
wyards
the
next
day
we
walked
over
to
chawton
to
make
enquiries
after
our
aunt
she
was
then
keeping
her
room
but
said
she
would
see
us
and
we
went
up
to
her
she
was
in
her
and
was
sitting
quite
like
an
invalid
in
an
but
she
got
up
and
kindly
greeted
us
and
then
pointing
to
seats
which
had
been
arranged
for
us
by
the
fire
she
said
is
a
chair
for
the
married
lady
and
a
little
stool
for
you
caroline
it
is
strange
but
those
trifling
words
were
the
last
of
hers
that
i
can
remember
for
i
retain
no
recollection
of
what
was
said
by
anyone
in
the
conversation
that
ensued
i
was
struck
by
the
alteration
in
herself
she
was
very
pale
her
voice
was
weak
and
low
and
there
was
about
her
a
general
appearance
of
debility
and
suffering
but
i
have
been
told
that
she
never
had
much
acute
pain
she
was
not
equal
to
the
exertion
of
talking
to
us
and
our
visit
to
the
sick
room
was
a
very
short
one
aunt
cassandra
soon
taking
us
away
i
do
not
suppose
we
stayed
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
i
never
saw
aunt
jane
again

writing

you
a
good
account
written
by
herself
in
a
letter
from
your
aunt
jane
but
all
who
love
and
that
is
all
who
know
her
must
be
anxious
on
her
account
when
may
came
she
consented
to
the
proposal
of
those
around
her
that
she
should
move
to
winchester
in
order
to
get
the
best
medical
advice
that
the
neighbourhood
afforded
the
lyford
family
had
maintained
for
some
time
a
high
character
for
skill
in
the
profession
of
medicine
at
that
place
and
the
lyford
of
the
day
was
a
man
of
more
than
provincial
reputation
in
whom
great
london
consultants
expressed
confidence
accordingly
on
saturday
may
she
bade
farewell
to
her
mother
and
her
home
and
her
brother
james
carriage
conveyed
cassandra
and
herself
to
winchester
the
little
cavalcade
for
they
were
attended
by
two
riders
started
in
sadness
and
in
rain
and
all
must
have
doubted
whether
she
would
ever
come
back
to
chawton
she
was
going
however
to
a
place
for
which
she
felt
the
veneration
which
all
good
hampshire
people
owe
to
their
county
town
a
veneration
shared
by
a
good
many
englishmen
outside
the
limits
of
the
county
the
sisters
took
lodgings
in
college
street
in
the
house
next
to
what
was
then
called
and
is
now
the
head
master
house
on
the
front
wall
of
the
little
house
where
they
lived
there
is
now
a
plaque
commemorating
the
stay
of
jane
austen
near
to
them
in
the
close
were
living
their
old
friends
heathcote
and
miss
bigg
who
did
all
they
could
to
add
to
their
comforts
while
at
the
school
were
their
nephew
charles
knight
and
young
william
heathcote
either
of
whom
they
might
hope
to
see
from
time
to
time
the
course
of
the
illness
and
its
fatal
termination
are
shown
pretty
clearly
in
the
letters
which
follow
the
most
informing
and
the
most
pathetic
of
which
next
to
her
own
are
the
two
written
by
cassandra
to
fanny
knight
after
all
was
ended
some
of
the
letters
are
undated
and
we
can
not
therefore
be
certain
of
the
order
in
which
they
were
written
we
must
also
allow
for
the
probable
fact
that
cassandra
did
not
say
more
than
was
necessary
to
her
mother
of
jane
increasing
weakness
and
discomfort
lyford
spoke
encouragingly
though
it
is
believed
that
he
had
from
the
first
very
little
expectation
of
a
permanent
cure
some
temporary
rally
there
seems
to
have
been
and
soon
after
settling
in
her
lodgings
jane
was
able
to
write
as
follows
to
edward
austen
david
college
street
winton
tuesday
may
i
know
no
better
way
my
dearest
edward
of
thanking
you
for
your
most
affectionate
concern
for
me
during
my
illness
than
by
telling
you
myself
as
soon
as
possible
that
i
continue
to
get
better
i
will
not
boast
of
my
handwriting
neither
that
nor
my
face
have
yet
recovered
their
proper
beauty
but
in
other
respects
i
am
gaining
strength
very
fast
i
am
now
out
of
bed
from
in
the
morning
to
at
night
upon
the
sopha
is
true
but
i
eat
my
meals
with
aunt
cass
in
a
rational
way
and
can
employ
myself
and
walk
from
one
room
to
another
lyford
says
he
will
cure
me
and
if
he
fails
i
shall
draw
up
a
memorial
and
lay
it
before
the
dean
and
chapter
and
have
no
doubt
of
redress
from
that
pious
learned
and
disinterested
body
our
lodgings
are
very
comfortable
we
have
a
neat
little
with
a
bow
window
overlooking
gabell
garden
thanks
to
the
kindness
of
your
father
and
mother
in
sending
me
their
carriage
my
journey
hither
on
saturday
was
performed
with
very
little
fatigue
and
had
it
been
a
fine
day
i
think
i
should
have
felt
none
but
it
distressed
me
to
see
uncle
henry
and
wm
knight
who
kindly
attended
us
on
horseback
riding
in
the
rain
almost
all
the
way
we
expect
a
visit
from
them
and
hope
they
will
stay
the
night
and
on
thursday
which
is
confirmation
and
a
holiday
we
are
to
get
charles
out
to
breakfast
we
have
had
but
one
visit
yet
from
poor
fellow
as
he
is
in
but
he
hopes
to
be
out
we
see
heathcote
every
day
and
william
is
to
call
upon
us
soon
god
bless
you
my
dear
edward
if
ever
you
are
ill
may
you
be
as
tenderly
nursed
as
i
have
been
may
the
same
blessed
alleviations
of
anxious
sympathising
friends
be
yours
and
may
you
possess
as
i
dare
say
you
will
the
greatest
blessing
of
all
in
the
consciousness
of
not
being
unworthy
of
their
love
could
not
feel
this
your
very
te
aunt
j
a
had
i
not
engaged
to
write
to
you
you
would
have
heard
again
from
your
aunt
martha
as
she
charged
me
to
tell
you
with
her
best
love
austen
exeter
college
oxford
the
original
of
this
letter
which
is
preserved
bears
sad
testimony
to
the
truth
of
her
remark
about
her
handwriting
some
few
days
after
this
she
must
have
written
her
last
extant
letter
quoted
in
the
short
memoir
prefixed
to
the
original
edition
of
my
attendant
is
encouraging
and
talks
of
making
me
quite
well
i
live
chiefly
on
the
sofa
but
am
allowed
to
walk
from
one
room
to
the
other
i
have
been
out
once
in
a
and
am
to
repeat
it
and
be
promoted
to
a
as
the
weather
serves
on
this
subject
i
will
only
say
further
that
my
dearest
sister
my
tender
watchful
indefatigable
nurse
has
not
been
made
ill
by
her
exertions
as
to
what
i
owe
to
her
and
to
the
anxious
affection
of
all
my
beloved
family
on
this
occasion
i
can
only
cry
over
it
and
pray
to
god
to
bless
them
more
and
more
some
allusion
to
the
family
disappointment
about
the
will
probably
followed
and
she
added
i
am
getting
too
near
complaint
it
has
been
the
appointment
of
god
however
secondary
causes
may
have
operated
jane
mother
could
still
indulge
in
the
hope
of
her
amendment
in
a
note
to
anna
she
says
you
will
be
happy
to
hear
that
our
accounts
from
winchester
are
very
good
our
letter
this
morning
which
was
written
yesterday
evening
says
has
had
a
better
night
than
she
has
had
for
many
weeks
and
has
been
comfortable
all
day
lyford
says
he
thinks
better
of
her
than
he
has
ever
done
though
he
must
still
consider
her
in
a
precarious
state
and
in
another
letter
i
had
a
very
comfortable
account
of
your
aunt
jane
this
morning
she
now
sits
up
a
little
charles
knight
came
this
morning
he
saw
her
yesterday
and
says
she
looks
better
and
seem
very
cheerful
she
hoped
to
be
well
enough
to
see
portal
your
mamma
is
there
went
yesterday
by
the
coach
which
i
am
very
glad
of
cassandra
did
not
quite
like
the
nurse
they
had
got
so
wish
j
to
come
in
her
stead
as
she
promised
she
would
whenever
she
was
wanted
james
austen
went
to
winchester
on
a
friday
perhaps
friday
june
two
or
three
days
afterwards
her
husband
wrote
to
their
son
edward
who
no
doubt
was
following
at
oxford
with
painful
interest
the
varying
news
james
at
any
rate
cherished
no
illusions
as
to
the
possibility
of
a
cure
steventon
thursday
my
dear
edward
i
grieve
to
write
what
you
will
grieve
to
read
but
i
must
tell
you
that
we
can
no
longer
flatter
ourselves
with
the
least
hope
of
having
your
dear
valuable
aunt
jane
restored
to
us
the
symptoms
which
returned
after
the
first
four
or
five
days
at
winchester
have
never
subsided
and
lyford
has
candidly
told
us
that
her
case
is
desperate
i
need
not
say
what
a
melancholy
gloom
this
has
cast
over
us
all
your
grandmamma
has
suffered
much
but
her
affliction
can
be
nothing
to
cassandra
she
will
indeed
be
to
be
pitied
it
is
some
consolation
to
know
that
our
poor
invalid
has
hitherto
felt
no
very
severe
pain
which
is
rather
an
extraordinary
circumstance
in
her
complaint
i
saw
her
on
tuesday
and
found
her
much
altered
but
composed
and
cheerful
she
is
well
aware
of
her
situation
your
mother
has
been
there
ever
since
friday
and
returns
not
till
all
is
over
how
soon
that
may
be
we
can
not
say
lyford
said
he
saw
no
signs
of
immediate
dissolution
but
added
that
with
such
a
pulse
it
was
impossible
for
any
person
to
last
long
and
indeed
no
one
can
wish
it
an
easy
departure
from
this
to
a
better
world
is
all
that
we
can
pray
for
i
am
going
to
winchester
again
you
may
depend
upon
early
information
when
any
change
takes
place
and
should
then
prepare
yourself
for
what
the
next
letter
announce
heathcote
is
the
greatest
possible
comfort
to
them
all
we
all
join
in
love
your
affectionate
father
austen
edward
young
sister
caroline
aged
twelve
adds
a
few
unhappy
lines
about
her
aunt
saying
now
feel
as
if
i
had
never
loved
and
valued
her
enough
jane
austen
her
faculties
her
memory
her
fancy
her
temper
and
her
affections
warm
clear
and
unimpaired
to
the
last
neither
her
love
of
god
nor
of
her
flagged
for
a
moment
her
two
clergyman
brothers
were
near
at
hand
to
administer
the
consolations
of
religion
and
she
made
a
point
of
receiving
the
holy
communion
while
she
was
still
strong
enough
to
follow
the
service
with
full
attention
she
used
the
language
of
hope
to
her
correspondents
she
was
fully
aware
of
her
danger
though
not
appalled
by
it
it
is
true
that
there
was
much
to
attach
her
to
life
she
was
happy
in
her
family
she
was
just
beginning
to
feel
confidence
in
her
own
success
and
no
doubt
the
exercise
of
her
great
talents
was
an
enjoyment
in
itself
we
may
well
believe
that
she
would
gladly
have
lived
longer
but
she
was
enabled
without
dismay
or
complaint
to
prepare
for
death
she
was
a
humble
believing
christian
her
life
had
been
passed
in
the
performance
of
home
duties
and
the
cultivation
of
domestic
affections
without
any
or
craving
after
applause
she
had
always
sought
as
it
were
by
instinct
to
promote
the
happiness
of
all
who
came
within
her
influence
and
doubtless
she
had
her
reward
in
the
peace
of
mind
which
was
granted
her
in
her
last
days
her
sweetness
of
temper
never
failed
she
was
ever
considerate
and
grateful
to
those
who
attended
on
her
at
times
when
she
felt
rather
better
her
playfulness
of
spirit
revived
and
she
amused
them
even
in
their
sadness
once
when
she
thought
herself
near
her
end
she
said
what
she
imagined
might
be
her
last
words
to
those
around
her
and
particularly
thanked
her
for
being
with
her
saying
you
have
always
been
a
kind
sister
to
me
mary
she
wrote
whilst
she
could
hold
a
pen
and
with
a
pencil
when
a
pen
had
become
too
laborious
even
a
day
or
two
before
her
death
she
was
able
to
compose
some
light
verses
on
swithin
winchester
races
and
the
weather
but
the
record
of
the
last
sad
hours
and
of
her
death
in
the
early
morning
of
friday
july
will
be
best
read
in
the
letter
of
cassandra
to
fanny
knight
winchester
sunday
july
my
dearest
fanny
doubly
dear
to
me
now
for
her
dear
sake
whom
we
have
lost
she
did
love
you
most
sincerely
and
never
shall
i
forget
the
proofs
of
love
you
gave
her
during
her
illness
in
writing
those
kind
amusing
letters
at
a
time
when
i
know
your
feelings
would
have
dictated
so
different
a
style
take
the
only
reward
i
can
give
you
in
the
assurance
that
your
benevolent
purpose
answered
you
contribute
to
her
enjoyment
even
your
last
letter
afforded
pleasure
i
merely
cut
the
seal
and
gave
it
to
her
she
opened
it
and
read
it
herself
afterwards
she
gave
it
me
to
read
and
then
talked
to
me
a
little
and
not
uncheerfully
of
its
contents
but
there
was
then
a
languor
about
her
which
prevented
her
taking
the
same
interest
in
anything
she
had
been
used
to
do
since
tuesday
evening
when
her
complaint
returned
there
was
a
visible
change
she
slept
more
and
much
more
comfortably
indeed
during
the
last
hours
she
was
more
asleep
than
awake
her
looks
altered
and
she
fell
away
but
i
perceived
no
material
diminution
of
strength
and
though
i
was
then
hopeless
of
a
recovery
i
had
no
suspicion
how
rapidly
my
loss
was
approaching
i
lost
a
treasure
such
a
sister
such
a
friend
as
never
can
have
been
surpassed
she
was
the
sun
of
my
life
the
gilder
of
every
pleasure
the
soother
of
every
sorrow
i
had
not
a
thought
concealed
from
her
and
it
is
as
if
i
had
lost
a
part
of
myself
i
loved
her
only
too
well
not
better
than
she
deserved
but
i
am
conscious
that
my
affection
for
her
made
me
sometimes
unjust
to
and
negligent
of
others
and
i
can
acknowledge
more
than
as
a
general
principle
the
justice
of
the
hand
which
has
struck
this
blow
you
know
me
too
well
to
be
at
all
afraid
that
i
should
suffer
materially
from
my
feelings
i
am
perfectly
conscious
of
the
extent
of
my
irreparable
loss
but
i
am
not
at
all
overpowered
and
very
little
indisposed
nothing
but
what
a
short
time
with
rest
and
change
of
air
will
remove
i
thank
god
that
i
was
enabled
to
attend
her
to
the
last
and
amongst
my
many
causes
of
i
have
not
to
add
any
wilful
neglect
of
her
comfort
she
felt
herself
to
be
dying
about
half
an
hour
before
she
became
tranquil
and
apparently
unconscious
during
that
was
her
struggle
poor
soul
she
said
she
could
not
tell
us
what
she
suffered
though
she
complained
of
little
fixed
pain
when
i
asked
her
if
there
was
anything
she
wanted
her
answer
was
she
wanted
nothing
but
death
and
some
of
her
words
were
grant
me
patience
pray
for
me
oh
pray
for
me
her
voice
was
affected
but
as
long
as
she
spoke
she
was
intelligible
i
hope
i
do
not
break
your
heart
my
dearest
fanny
by
these
particulars
i
mean
to
afford
you
gratification
whilst
i
am
relieving
my
own
feelings
i
could
not
write
so
to
anybody
else
indeed
you
are
the
only
person
i
have
written
to
at
all
excepting
your
grandmamma
it
was
to
her
not
your
uncle
charles
i
wrote
on
friday
immediately
after
dinner
on
thursday
i
went
into
the
town
to
do
an
errand
which
your
dear
aunt
was
anxious
about
i
returned
about
a
quarter
before
six
and
found
her
recovering
from
faintness
and
oppression
she
got
so
well
as
to
be
able
to
give
me
a
minute
account
of
her
seizure
and
when
the
clock
struck
six
she
was
talking
quietly
to
me
i
can
not
say
how
soon
afterwards
she
was
seized
again
with
the
same
faintness
which
was
followed
by
the
sufferings
she
could
not
describe
but
lyford
had
been
sent
for
had
applied
something
to
give
her
ease
and
she
was
in
a
state
of
quiet
insensibility
by
seven
at
the
latest
from
that
time
till
four
when
she
ceased
to
breathe
she
scarcely
moved
a
limb
so
that
we
have
every
reason
to
think
with
gratitude
to
the
almighty
that
her
sufferings
were
over
a
slight
motion
of
the
head
with
every
breath
remained
till
almost
the
last
i
sat
close
to
her
with
a
pillow
in
my
lap
to
assist
in
supporting
her
head
which
was
almost
off
the
bed
for
six
hours
fatigue
made
me
then
resign
my
place
to
j
for
two
hours
and
a
half
when
i
took
it
again
and
in
about
an
hour
more
she
breathed
her
last
i
was
able
to
close
her
eyes
myself
and
it
was
a
great
gratification
to
me
to
render
her
those
last
services
there
was
nothing
convulsed
which
gave
the
idea
of
pain
in
her
look
on
the
contrary
but
for
the
continual
motion
of
the
head
she
gave
one
the
idea
of
a
beautiful
statue
and
even
now
in
her
coffin
there
is
such
a
sweet
serene
air
over
her
countenance
as
is
quite
pleasant
to
contemplate
this
day
my
dearest
fanny
you
have
had
the
melancholy
intelligence
and
i
know
you
suffer
severely
but
i
likewise
know
that
you
will
apply
to
the
for
consolation
and
that
our
merciful
god
is
never
deaf
to
such
prayers
as
you
will
offer
the
last
sad
ceremony
is
to
take
place
on
thursday
morning
her
dear
remains
are
to
be
deposited
in
the
cathedral
it
is
a
satisfaction
to
me
to
think
that
they
are
to
lie
in
a
building
she
admired
so
much
her
precious
soul
i
presume
to
hope
reposes
in
a
far
superior
mansion
may
mine
one
day
be
to
it
your
dear
papa
your
uncle
henry
and
frank
and
edwd
austen
instead
of
his
father
will
attend
i
hope
they
will
none
of
them
suffer
lastingly
from
their
pious
exertions
the
ceremony
must
be
over
before
ten
as
the
cathedral
service
begins
at
that
hour
so
that
we
shall
be
at
home
early
in
the
day
for
there
will
be
nothing
to
keep
us
here
afterwards
your
uncle
james
came
to
us
yesterday
and
is
gone
home
uncle
goes
to
chawton
morning
he
has
given
every
necessary
direction
here
and
i
think
his
company
there
will
do
good
he
returns
to
us
again
on
tuesday
evening
i
did
not
think
to
have
written
a
long
letter
when
i
began
but
i
have
found
the
employment
draw
me
on
and
i
hope
i
shall
have
been
giving
you
more
pleasure
than
pain
remember
me
kindly
to
bridges
i
am
so
glad
she
is
with
you
now
and
give
my
best
love
to
lizzie
and
all
the
others
i
am
my
dearest
fanny
most
affectionately
yours
cass
eliz
austen
i
have
said
nothing
about
those
at
chawton
because
i
am
sure
you
hear
from
your
papa
during
these
sad
days
anna
lefroy
had
written
to
her
grandmother
at
chawton
offering
to
go
to
her
austen
answered
i
thank
you
sincerely
for
all
your
kind
expressions
and
your
offer
i
am
certainly
in
a
good
deal
of
affliction
but
trust
god
will
support
me
i
was
not
prepared
for
the
blow
though
it
in
a
manner
hung
over
us
i
had
reason
to
think
it
at
a
distance
and
was
not
quite
without
hope
that
she
might
in
part
recover
after
a
few
months
illness
she
may
be
said
to
have
died
suddenly
lyford
supposed
a
large
had
given
way
i
hope
her
sufferings
were
not
severe
they
were
not
long
i
had
a
letter
from
cassandra
this
morning
she
is
in
great
affliction
but
bears
it
like
a
christian
dear
jane
is
to
be
buried
in
the
cathedral
i
believe
on
thursday
in
which
case
cassandra
will
come
home
as
soon
as
it
is
over
cassandra
did
go
home
and
a
few
days
later
wrote
again
to
fanny
knight
as
follows
chawton
tuesday
july
my
dearest
fanny
i
have
just
read
your
letter
for
the
third
time
and
thank
you
most
sincerely
for
every
kind
expression
to
myself
and
still
more
warmly
for
your
praises
of
her
who
i
believe
was
better
known
to
you
than
to
any
human
being
besides
myself
nothing
of
the
sort
could
have
been
more
gratifying
to
me
than
the
manner
in
which
you
write
of
her
and
if
the
dear
angel
is
conscious
of
what
passes
here
and
is
not
above
all
earthly
feelings
she
may
perhaps
receive
pleasure
in
being
so
mourned
had
been
the
survivor
i
can
fancy
her
speaking
of
in
almost
the
same
terms
there
are
certainly
many
points
of
strong
resemblance
in
your
characters
in
your
intimate
acquaintance
with
each
other
and
your
mutual
strong
affection
you
were
counterparts
thursday
was
not
so
dreadful
a
day
to
me
as
you
imagined
there
was
so
much
necessary
to
be
done
that
there
was
no
time
for
additional
misery
everything
was
conducted
with
the
greatest
tranquillity
and
but
that
i
was
determined
i
would
see
the
last
and
therefore
was
upon
the
listen
i
should
not
have
known
when
they
left
the
house
i
watched
the
little
mournful
procession
the
length
of
the
street
and
when
it
turned
from
my
sight
and
i
had
lost
her
for
ever
even
then
i
was
not
overpowered
nor
so
much
agitated
as
i
am
now
in
writing
of
it
never
was
human
being
more
sincerely
mourned
by
those
who
attended
her
remains
than
was
this
dear
creature
may
the
sorrow
with
which
she
is
parted
with
on
earth
be
a
prognostic
of
the
joy
with
which
she
is
hailed
in
heaven
i
continue
very
tolerably
well
much
better
than
any
one
could
have
supposed
possible
because
i
certainly
have
had
considerable
fatigue
of
body
as
well
as
anguish
of
mind
for
months
back
but
i
really
am
well
and
i
hope
i
am
properly
grateful
to
the
almighty
for
having
been
so
supported
your
grandmamma
too
is
much
better
than
when
i
came
home
i
did
not
think
your
dear
papa
appeared
unwell
and
i
understand
that
he
seemed
much
more
comfortable
after
his
return
from
winchester
than
he
had
done
before
i
need
not
tell
you
that
he
was
a
great
comfort
to
me
indeed
i
can
never
say
enough
of
the
kindness
i
have
received
from
him
and
from
every
other
friend
i
get
out
of
doors
a
good
deal
and
am
able
to
employ
myself
of
course
those
employments
suit
me
best
which
leave
me
most
at
leisure
to
think
of
her
i
have
lost
and
i
do
think
of
her
in
every
variety
of
circumstance
in
our
happy
hours
of
confidential
intercourse
in
the
cheerful
family
party
which
she
so
ornamented
in
her
sick
room
on
her
and
as
i
hope
an
inhabitant
of
heaven
oh
if
i
may
one
day
be
to
her
there
i
know
the
time
must
come
when
my
mind
will
be
less
engrossed
by
her
idea
but
i
do
not
like
to
think
of
it
if
i
think
of
her
less
as
on
earth
god
grant
that
i
may
never
cease
to
reflect
on
her
as
inhabiting
heaven
and
never
cease
my
humble
endeavours
when
it
shall
please
god
to
join
her
there
in
looking
at
a
few
of
the
precious
papers
which
are
now
my
property
i
have
found
some
memorandums
amongst
which
she
desires
that
one
of
her
gold
chains
may
be
given
to
her
louisa
and
a
lock
of
her
hair
be
set
for
you
you
can
need
no
assurance
my
dearest
fanny
that
every
request
of
your
beloved
aunt
will
be
sacred
with
me
be
so
good
as
to
say
whether
you
prefer
a
brooch
or
ring
god
bless
you
my
dearest
fanny
believe
me
most
affectionately
yours
cass
elizth
austen
so
ends
the
story
of
jane
austen
life
we
can
only
hope
that
we
have
succeeded
in
conveying
to
the
reader
even
a
small
part
of
the
feeling
which
we
ourselves
entertain
of
the
charm
of
her
personality
a
charm
almost
as
remarkable
in
its
way
as
the
brightness
of
her
genius
in
one
respect
it
is
easy
to
write
about
her
there
is
nothing
to
conceal
some
readers
may
perhaps
add
is
little
to
tell
and
it
is
true
that
though
the
want
of
incident
in
her
life
has
often
been
exaggerated
her
occupations
were
largely
those
of
helpfulness
and
sympathy
towards
others
whose
lot
was
more
variable
than
hers
and
the
development
of
her
own
powers
to
be
the
delight
of
generations
of
readers
but
this
position
gave
her
quite
sufficient
opportunity
of
showing
her
character
and
it
is
a
character
which
it
is
a
continual
pleasure
to
contemplate
her
perfect
balance
and
good
sense
did
not
diminish
her
liveliness
her
intellectual
qualities
did
not
prevent
the
enjoyment
of
a
dance
or
attention
to
the
most
domestic
duties
her
consciousness
of
genius
left
room
for
a
belief
that
cassandra
was
wiser
and
better
than
herself
her
keen
and
humorous
observation
of
the
frailties
of
mankind
was
compatible
with
indulgence
towards
the
faults
of
her
neighbours
her
growing
fame
did
not
make
her
the
less
accessible
and
delightful
to
her
nieces
who
could
consult
their
aunt
and
obtain
a
willing
listener
in
any
difficulty
whatever
from
a
doubtful
love
affair
to
the
working
of
a
sampler
indeed
she
is
a
standing
witness
to
the
truth
that
eccentricity
and
are
not
essential
parts
of
genius
when
her
body
had
been
laid
in
winchester
cathedral
the
small
band
of
mourners
went
back
in
sadness
to
their
different
homes
they
were
very
fond
and
very
proud
of
her
and
each
we
are
told
loved
afterwards
to
fancy
a
resemblance
in
some
niece
or
daughter
of
their
own
to
the
dear
sister
jane
whose
perfect
equal
they
yet
never
expected
to
see
cassandra
returned
to
chawton
and
devoted
a
further
ten
years
to
the
care
of
her
aged
mother
till
old
austen
death
in
martha
lloyd
remained
an
inmate
and
everything
went
on
nominally
as
before
but
the
light
was
quenched
and
the
loss
of
it
had
cast
a
shade
over
the
spirits
of
the
survivors
so
when
the
young
austens
went
to
stay
there
expecting
to
be
particularly
happy
they
could
not
help
feeling
something
of
the
chill
of
disappointment
later
martha
became
the
second
wife
of
francis
austen
while
cassandra
lived
on
at
chawton
one
of
her
remembers
seeing
her
towards
the
end
of
her
life
at
a
christening
pale
old
lady
with
a
high
arched
nose
and
a
kind
smile
dressed
in
a
long
cloak
and
a
large
drawn
bonnet
both
made
of
black
satin
she
died
of
a
sudden
illness
in
at
the
house
of
her
brother
francis
near
portsmouth
at
his
house
but
in
his
absence
for
he
and
his
family
had
to
leave
for
the
west
indies
where
he
was
to
take
up
a
command
while
she
lay
dying
she
was
tended
by
her
brothers
henry
and
charles
and
her
niece
caroline
she
was
buried
beside
her
mother
at
chawton
all
her
brothers
survived
her
except
james
who
was
in
bad
health
when
his
sister
jane
died
and
followed
her
in
edward
knight
saw
his
children
and
his
children
children
grow
up
around
him
and
died
at
godmersham
as
peacefully
as
he
had
lived
in
henry
held
the
living
of
steventon
for
three
years
after
the
death
of
his
brother
james
till
his
nephew
william
knight
was
ready
to
take

he
was
afterwards
perpetual
curate
of
bentley
near
farnham
later
on

lived
for
some
time
in
france
and
he
died

and
against

and
became
in
in
he
commanded
in
the
east
indian
and
chinese
waters
and
died
of
cholera
on
the
irawaddy
river
in
having
the
hearts
of
all
by
his
gentleness
and
kindness
whilst
he
was
struggling
with
disease
francis
had
thirty
years
on
shore
after
the
end
of
the
long
war
and
his
only
subsequent
foreign
service
was
the
command
of
the
west
indian
and
north
american
station
he
however
constantly
rose
in
his
profession
and
enjoyed
the
esteem
and
respect
of
the
admiralty
he
ended
by
being
and
admiral
of
the
fleet
and
did
not
die
until
aged
shortly
before
the
end
of
her
life
jane
austen
wrote
on
a
slip
of
paper

my
novels
over
and
above

were

to
the
former
was
prefixed
a
short
biographical
notice
of
the
author
from
the
pen
of
henry
austen
in
bentley
bought
the
copyright
of
all
the
novels
except
and
which
jane
austen
had
sold
outright
to
egerton
from
henry
and
cassandra
austen
the
joint
proprietors
for
the
sum
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
bentley
must
also
have
bought
from
executors
the
copyright
of
and
for
he
proceeded
to
issue
a
complete
edition
of
the
novels
with
a
biographical
notice
also
by
henry
containing
a
few
extra
facts
not
mentioned
in
the
original
edition
of
james
edward
austen
who
added
to
his
name
on
succeeding
to
the
property
of
scarlets
in
wrote
in
the
of
his
aunt
which
has
been
so
often
used
in
these
pages
and
which
as
the
work
of
three
eyewitnesses
enjoys
an
authority
greater
than
that
of
any
other
account
of
her
its
publication
coincided
with
the
beginning
of
a
great
advance
in
her
fame
and
we
think
it
may
be
claimed
that
it
was
an
important
contributory
cause
of
that
advance
before
that
date
an
appreciation
of
her
genius
was
rather
the
special
possession
of
small
literary
circles
and
individual
families
since
that
date
it
has
been
widely
spread
both
in
england
and
in
america
from
her
death
to
there
was
only
one
complete
edition
of
her
works
and
nothing
except
a
few
articles
and
reviews
was
written
about
her
since
editions
lives
memoirs
have
been
almost
too
numerous
to
count
we
who
are
adding
to
this
stream
of
writings
can
not
induce
ourselves
to
believe
that
the
interest
of
the
public
is
yet
exhausted

text
of
jane
austen
in
the
course
of
frequent
reprinting
various
errors
have
crept
into
the
text
of
the
novels
which
seem
in
danger
of
becoming
perpetuated
we
therefore
make
no
apology
for
pointing
these
out
and
for
giving
our
reasons
why
we
prefer
any
particular
reading
in
arriving
at
the
correct
text
of
jane
austen
common
sense
will
be
our
best
guide
it
is
of
no
use
to
assume
as
some
editors
have
done
that
the
latest
edition
which
appeared
in
the
author
lifetime
and
which
might
naturally
have
had
the
benefit
of
her
corrections
is
any
more
correct
than
the
earliest
jane
austen
was
no
skilled
proofreader
and
it
is
a
melancholy
fact
that
the
second
edition
of
which
she
returned
to
murray
ready
for
press
as
she
could
make
it
contains
more
misprints
than
any
of
the
other
novels
including
one
or
two
that
do
not
appear
in
the
first
edition
but
as
the
type
was
evidently
this
may
have
been
as
much
the
printer
fault
as
the
author
again
though
in
one
of
her
letters
she
points
out
a
misprint
in
the
first
edition
of
and
the
passage
is
not
corrected
in
either
the
second
or
third
edition
both
of
which
subsequently
appeared
in
her
lifetime
before
noticing
the
various
discrepancies
it
is
necessary
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
chief
editions
of
note
during
the
author
lifetime
three
editions
appeared
of
and
two
of
and
and
of
and
one
of
and
were
published
soon
after
her
death
no
other
edition
of
the
novels
seems
to
have
been
published
until
bentley
bought
up
the
copyrights
of
all
the
novels
in
and
included
them
in
his
novels
series
in
process
of
time
bentley
edition
adopted
various
emendations
in
the
text
it
held
the
field
to
all
intents
and
purposes
for
sixty
years
apart
from
cheap
reprints
in
the
series
library
and
its
text
has
largely
been
followed
in
later
editions
especially
by
macmillan
in
their
classics
series
other
recent
editions
containing
a
more
or
less
independent
text
arrived
at
by
following
the
earliest
editions
are
those
edited
for
dent
by
brimley
johnson
the
earliest
of
which
appeared
in
and
the
most
recent
of
which
has
appeared
in
library
the
hampshire
edition
by
brimley
johnson
but
differing
considerably
from
the
editions
which
he
has
and
the
winchester
edition
published
by
grant
richards
finally
with
regard
to
textual
criticism
we
have
an
article
the
printing
of
jane
austen
novels
by
the
late
verrall
contributed
to
the
about
and
two
others
also
by
verrall
some
passages
in
jane
austen
in
the
for
november
and
december
and
certain
emendations
pointed
out
in
a
review
of
a
new
edition
of
and
in
the
of
november
and
in
this
novel
scarcely
anything
calls
for
notice
the
main
divergencies
seem
to
be
that
the
editions
are
divided
between
reading
happiness
and
an
happiness
at
the
end
of
chapter
iii
between
all
who
called
themselves
her
friends
and
all
who
call
themselves
her
friends
in
chapter
xxxii
and
of
the
happiest
couples
or
of
the
happiest
couple
in
chapter
johnson
edition
has
an
unfortunate
blunder
at
the
beginning
of
chapter
xxxii
reading
effect
on
her
was
entirely
such
as
the
former
had
hoped
to
see
instead
of
effect
on
her
was
not
entirely
and
the
first
passage
that
we
consider
to
be
frequently
misprinted
is
in
chapter
iii
where
bennet
is
giving
her
husband
an
account
of
the
meryton
assembly
and
of
bingley
partners
the
first
three
editions
followed
by
johnson
the
winchester
and
hampshire
editions
print
thus
the
two
third
he
danced
with
miss
king
and
the
two
fourth
with
maria
lucas
and
the
two
fifth
with
jane
again
and
the
two
sixth
with
lizzie
and
the
boulanger
he
had
had
any
compassion
for
me
cried
her
husband
impatiently
would
not
have
danced
half
so
much
for
god
sake
say
no
more
of
his
partners
o
that
he
had
sprained
his
ankle
in
the
first
dance
my
dear
continued
bennet
am
quite
delighted
with
him
he
is
so
excessively
handsome
and
his
sisters
are
charming
women
i
never
in
my
life
saw
anything
more
elegant
than
their
dresses
i
dare
say
the
lace
upon
hurst
gown
here
she
was
interrupted
again
bennet
protested
against
any
description
of
finery
now
here
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
we
should
read
as
in
edition
the
two
sixth
with
lizzie
and
the
bingley
danced
the
with
another
partner
whose
name
bennet
would
have
given
but
for
her
husband
interrupting
her
in
the
first
place
there
is
every
reason
to
suppose
that
bingley
danced
no
more
than
two
sixth
each
dance
seems
to
have
been
divided
into
two
parts
but
without
any
change
of
partners
with
lizzie
for
bennet
has
already
said
that
jane
the
only
creature
in
the
room
that
he
asked
a
second
time
secondly
the
reading
of
the
first
edition
destroys
the
point
of
she
was
interrupted
again
the
next
passage
which
is
frequently
misprinted
is
in
chapter
xix
where
collins
in
the
course
of
his
proposal
to
elizabeth
quotes
the
advice
of
his
very
noble
patroness
bentley
edition
here
reads
collins
you
must
marry
a
clergyman
like
you
must
marry
choose
properly
choose
a
gentlewoman
for
my
sake
and
for
your
own
let
her
be
an
active
useful
sort
of
person
not
brought
up
high
but
able
to
make
a
small
income
go
a
good
way
by
transposing
a
comma
and
a
semicolon
the
printer
has
here
succeeded
in
perverting
a
most
characteristic
bit
of
advice
of
lady
catherine
the
first
three
editions
followed
by
johnson
all
read
properly
choose
a
gentlewoman
for
my
sake
and
for
your
own
let
her
be
an
active
useful
sort
of
person
and
there
can
hardly
be
two
opinions
as
to
which
reading
is
the
right
one
in
chapter
xxxvi
where
elizabeth
is
reviewing
her
conduct
towards
darcy
bentley
edition
following
the
first
and
second
editions
makes
her
exclaim
despicably
have
i
acted
she
cried
who
have
prided
myself
on
my
discernment
i
who
have
valued
myself
on
my
abilities
who
have
often
disdained
the
generous
candour
of
my
sister
and
gratified
my
vanity
in
useless
or
blameless
distrust
makes
little
or
no
sense
and
we
should
surely
follow
the
third
edition
which
gives
chapter
xxxviii
when
elizabeth
bennet
and
maria
lucas
are
leaving
hunsford
parsonage
brimley
johnson
in
his
edition
of
following
the
first
and
second
editions
arranges
the
sentences
as
follows
gracious
cried
maria
after
a
few
silence
seems
but
a
day
or
two
since
we
first
came
and
yet
how
many
things
have
happened
great
many
indeed
said
her
companion
with
a
sigh
have
dined
nine
times
at
rosings
besides
drinking
tea
there
twice
how
much
i
shall
have
to
tell
elizabeth
privately
added
how
much
i
shall
have
to
conceal
the
effect
of
this
is
to
give
the
extremely
banal
remark
about
dining
and
drinking
tea
at
rosings
to
elizabeth
instead
of
to
maria
the
third
edition
followed
by
all
the
others
gives
the
correct
arrangement
great
many
indeed
said
her
companion
with
a
sigh
have
dined
nine
times
at
rosings
besides
drinking
tea
there
twice
how
much
i
shall
have
to
tell
in
chapter
l
where
bennet
is
discussing
the
various
houses
in
the
neighbourhood
which
might
suit
wickham
and
lydia
bennet
is
made
in
bentley
and
all
subsequent
editions
to
remark
bennet
before
you
take
any
or
all
of
these
houses
for
your
son
and
daughter
let
us
come
to
a
right
understanding
into
house
in
this
neighbourhood
they
shall
never
have
admittance
i
will
not
encourage
the
imprudence
of
either
by
receiving
them
at
longbourn
now
seems
distinctly
below
bennet
usual
form
and
we
should
obviously
follow
the
first
and
second
editions
and
read
compare
the
sentence
in
chapter
lvii
where
bennet
talking
of
collins
correspondence
says
i
read
a
letter
of
his
i
can
not
help
giving
him
the
preference
even
over
wickham
much
as
i
value
the
impudence
and
hypocrisy
of
my
it
is
the
third
edition
that
has
here
gone
astray
and
misled
all
the
others
chapter
liv
when
bingley
and
darcy
have
been
dining
at
longbourn
we
read
in
johnson
edition
as
well
as
in
the
hampshire
and
winchester
editions
the
gentlemen
came
and
she
thought
he
looked
as
if
he
would
have
answered
her
hopes
but
alas
the
ladies
had
crowded
round
the
table
where
miss
bennet
was
taking
tea
and
elizabeth
pouring
out
the
coffee
this
is
an
ingenious
little
misprint
for
what
miss
bennet
who
was
one
of
the
hostesses
was
doing
was
not
tea
of
course
but

greatest
blunder
in

in

correct
the
mistake
bentley
edition
fell
into
another
and
johnson

to
break

chapter
lv
when
jane
engagement
to
bingley
had
been
arranged
bentley
edition
following
the
third
edition
reads
elizabeth
who
was
left
by
herself
now
smiled
at
the
rapidity
and
ease
with
which
an
affair
was
finally
settled
that
had
given
them
so
many
previous
months
of
surprise
and
vexation
does
not
seem
nearly
so
suitable
a
word
as
which
is
found
in
the
first
and
second
editions
chapter
lv
where
jane
is
talking
to
elizabeth
about
bingley
johnson
editions
following
the
first
three
editions
read
you
believe
it
lizzie
that
when
he
went
to
town
last
november
he
really
loved
me
and
nothing
but
a
persuasion
of
my
being
indifferent
would
have
prevented
his
coming
down
again
made
a
little
mistake
to
be
sure
but
it
is
to
the
credit
of
his
modesty
this
naturally
introduced
a
panegyric
from
jane
on
his
diffidence
and
the
little
value
he
put
on
his
own
good
qualities
elizabeth
was
pleased
to
find
that
he
had
not
betrayed
the
interference
of
his
friends
for
though
jane
had
the
most
generous
and
forgiving
heart
in
the
world
she
knew
it
was
a
circumstance
which
must
prejudice
her
against
him
as
this
last
paragraph
stands
can
hardly
refer
to
anyone
else
but
bingley
which
makes
nonsense
nothing
was
likely
to
prejudice
jane
against
him
besides
it
was
not
his
who
had
interfered
but
his
darcy
there
can
be
no
doubt
therefore
that
we
ought
to
read
with
bentley
edition
and
then
will
refer
to
darcy
against
whom
lizzie
was
very
anxious
on
her
own
account
that
jane
should
not
be
prejudiced
chapter
lvi
when
lady
catherine
is
trying
to
browbeat
elizabeth
johnson
reads
in
his
edition
of
following
the
first
two
editions
which
however
have
a
comma
after
in
their
cradles
we
planned
the
union
and
now
at
the
moment
when
the
wishes
of
both
sisters
would
be
accomplished
in
their
marriage
to
be
prevented
by
a
young
woman
of
inferior
birth
of
no
importance
in
the
world
and
wholly
unallied
to
the
family
most
editions
however
following
the
third
merely
alter
the
interrogation
to
an
exclamation
mark
but
it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
we
ought
not
to
read
their
marriage
instead
of
their
marriage
placing
the
comma
three
words
earlier
then
we
can
keep
the
interrogation
so
the
edition
published
by
george
allen
in
chapter
viii
bentley
edition
following
the
first
and
second
editions
reads
rushworth
proceeded
next
under
the
conviction
that
everybody
must
be
wanting
to
see
sotherton
to
include
miss
crawford
in
the
invitation
and
though
miss
grant
who
had
not
been
at
the
trouble
of
visiting
rushworth
on
her
coming
into
the
neighbourhood
civilly
declined
it
on
her
own
account
she
was
glad
to
secure
any
pleasure
for
her
sister
and
mary
properly
pressed
and
persuaded
was
not
long
in
accepting
her
share
of
the
civility
inasmuch
as
there
is
no
such
character
as
grant

the
book
all
other
editions

the
pages
of
the
defended
grant
provided
that
were
placed
between
inverted
commas
as
well
as
the
previous
crawford
he
believed
rushworth
to
have
been
a
blundering
kind
of
person
who
desired
to
invite
miss
crawford
but
while
naming
addressed
herself
to
grant
otherwise
if
we
read
grant
verrall
argued
there
was
not
the
slightest
occasion
for
grant
to
decline
the
invitation
on
her
own
account
for
she
had
not
been
in
any
way
invited
nor
would
there
have
been
any
need
for
mary
to
be
pressed
and
persuaded
and
then
to
accept
share
of
the
civility
verrall
suggestion
is
ingenious
but
not
quite
convincing
chapter
viii
bentley
edition
following
the
first
and
second
editions
reads
when
edmund
therefore
told
her
in
reply
as
he
did
when
she
would
give
him
the
hearing
that
she
need
not
distress
herself
on
account
because
he
had
taken
the
opportunity
as
he
walked
with
her
through
the
hall
of
mentioning
miss
price
as
one
who
would
probably
be
of
the
party
and
had
directly
received
a
very
sufficient
invitation
for
her
cousin
cousin
would
certainly
seem
to
be
a
mistake
and
all
other
editions
accordingly
alter
to
verrall
however
defends
and
would
read
had
directly
received
a
very
sufficient
invitation
for
her
cousin
on
the
ground
that
rushworth
not
quite
understanding
who
was
meant
by
miss
price
thought
she
was
cousin
to
the
miss
price
who
she
had
previously
heard
would
remain
at
home
with
lady
bertram
some
such
explanation
verrall
thought
would
alone
account
for
the
sufficient
invitation
chapter
x
where
fanny
price
says
to
rushworth
who
on
returning
with
the
key
finds
miss
bertram
and
crawford
have
gone
into
the
park
without
waiting
for
him
desired
me
to
stay
my
cousin
maria
charged
me
to
say
that
you
would
find
them
at
that
knoll
or
thereabouts
so
all
the
editions
read
but
verrall
would
emend
to
desired
me
to
say
my
cousin
on
the
ground
that
fanny
who
was
the
soul
of
truth
had
not
been
desired
to
stay
but
for
the
matter
of
that
neither
had
her
cousin
maria
charged
her
to
say
anything
for
it
was
crawford
who
had
suggested
that
price
will
be
so
good
as
to
tell
him
that
he
will
find
us
near
that
knoll
however
the
emendation
is
attractive
as
it
shows
fanny
trying
to
make
the
best
case
she
can
for
maria
by
eliminating
crawford
share
in
the
transaction
chapter
xxiv
all
editions
read
this
dear
william
would
soon
be
amongst
them
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
his
obtaining
leave
of
absence
immediately
for
he
was
still
only
a
midshipman
and
as
his
parents
from
living
on
the
spot
must
already
have
seen
him
and
be
seeing
him
perhaps
daily
his
direct
holidays
might
with
justice
be
instantly
given
to
his
sister
the
expression
direct
holidays
meaning
actual
holidays
is
intelligible
enough
but
did
not
satisfy
verrall
who
suggested
as
a
naval
expression
to
imply
holidays
on
which
no
one
had
a
claim
and
which
might
therefore
be
given
to
mansfield
park
like
many
of
verrall
emendations
its
ingenuity
is
greater
than
its
probability
chapter
xxxiii
here
again
was
a
something
of
the
same
crawford
whom
she
had
so
reprobated
before
how
evidently
was
there
a
gross
want
of
feeling
and
humanity
where
his
own
pleasure
was
concerned
and
alas
how
always
known
no
principle
to
supply
as
a
duty
what
the
heart
was
deficient
in
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
jane
austen
can
have
written
anything
so
clumsy
as
always
known
no
principle
such
however
is
the
reading
of
all
the
editions
except
the
hampshire
edition
which
without
giving
any
note
violently
emends
to
lacking
the
principle
chapter
xxxix
bentley
following
the
second
edition
reads

spent
in

kind
of
slow
bustle

busy

getting
on
always
behind
hand
and
lamenting
it
without
altering
her
ways
wishing
to
be
an
economist
without
contrivance
or
regularity
dissatisfied
with
her
servants
without
skill
to
make
them
better
and
whether
helping
or
reprimanding
or
indulging
them
without
any
power
of
engaging
their
respect
here
the
printer
has
been
most
ingenious

text
should
of
course
be
busy
as
it
is
in
the
first
edition

the
hampshire

undoubtedly
abate
somewhat
of

still
it

sort

the
better
of

as
to
his
ever
meeting

any
other
woman
who
could

too
impossible

be
named

with
indignation

nonsense

an
unnecessary
alteration

your

young

can
be
amiable
only
in
french
not
in
english
he
may
be
very
aimable
have
very
good
manners
and
be
very
agreeable
but
he
can
have
no
english
delicacy
towards
the
feelings
of
other
people
nothing
really
amiable
about
him
this
reading
found
in
the
first
edition
and
the
winchester
edition
is
without
doubt
correct
but
bentley
johnson
and
the
hampshire
edition
read
may
be
very
amiable
chapter
xxiii

when
satisfied
on
all
these
points
and
their
acquaintance
proportionably
advanced
johnson
in
his
edition
did
not
approve
of
the
word
and
read
proportionately
but
he
has
since
altered
his
mind
the
first
edition
and
all
others
read
and
there
appears
to
be
authority
for
such
a
word

a
little
sign
of
sentiment
so
johnson
editions
read
following
the
first
edition
but
bentley
as
well
as
the
hampshire
and
winchester
editions
read
which
seems
to
be
certainly
right
chapter
xliv
jane
took
elton
aside
and
told
her
at
once
that
upon
thinking
over
the
advantages
of
suckling
situation
she
had
come
to
the
resolution
of
accepting
it
so
the
first
edition
followed
by
bentley
but
this
is
plainly
a
mistake
for
smallridge
and
is
corrected
by
johnson
the
winchester
and
hampshire
editions
chapter
xlvi
where
weston
tells
emma
that
his
wife
has
something
to
break
to
her
and
emma
at
once
fears
for
her
relations
in
brunswick
square
weston
do
not
trifle
with
me
consider
how
many
of
my
dearest
friends
are
now
in
brunswick
square
which
of
them
is
it
i
charge
you
by
all
that
is
sacred
not
to
attempt
concealment
my
word
emma
word
why
not
your
honour
why
not
say
upon
your
honour
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
of
them
good
heavens
what
can
be
to
be
to
me
that
does
relate
to
one
of
that
family
so
the
first
edition
followed
by
bentley
but
johnson
the
hampshire
and
winchester
editions
insert
before
and
the
negative
seems
needed
chapter
xlvii
this
was
the
conclusion
of
the
first
series
of
reflection
so
the
first
edition
followed
by
bentley
johnson
the
hampshire
and
winchester
editions
give
but
in
jane
austen
novels
the
expression
series
of
is
continually
followed
by
a
noun
in
the
singular
when
nowadays
we
should
probably
use
the
plural
chapter
xxxvi
series
of
dissipation
and
chapter
xxvii
series
of
rain
chapter
xlvi
series
of
imprudence
cf
chapter
xxii
a
series
of
what
appeared
to
him
strong
encouragement
though
the
hampshire
edition
has
altered
this
to
chapter
vi
am
sure
it
is
laurentina
skeleton
a
reference
to
radcliffe
mysteries
of
will
show
that
should
be
all
editions
however
read
chapter
viii
us
walk
about
and
quiz
people
come
along
with
me
and
i
will
show
you
the
four
greatest
quizzers
in
the
room
my
two
younger
sisters
and
their
partners
i
have
been
laughing
at
them
this
so
the
first
edition
the
hampshire
and
winchester
editions
bentley
however
reads
which
seems
correct
as
the
word
usually
bore
an
active
sense
and
a
passive
chapter
xi
they
all
spent
the
evening
together
at
thorpe
it
seems
improbable
that
jane
austen
can
have
written
anything
other
than
the
thorpes
but
no
edition
has
had
the
courage
to
make
the
change
chapter
xiii
and
with
these
words
she
broke
away
and
hurried
off
thorpe
would
have
darted
after
her
but
morland
withheld
him
her
go
let
her
go
if
she
will
go
she
is
as
obstinate
as
thorpe
never
finished
the
simile
for
it
could
hardly
have
been
a
proper
one
so
the
first
edition
reads
followed
by
bentley
and
the
winchester
edition
the
hampshire
edition
boldly
gives
and
this
seems
the
natural
solution
the
only
alternative
is
to
break
up
the
sentence
thus
but
morland
withheld
him
her
go
let
her
go
if
she
will
is
as
obstinate
as
thorpe
never
finished
the
simile
but
this
does
not
seem
so
natural
nor
do
we
imagine
that
the
impropriety
of
the
simile
would
necessarily
have
debarred
thorpe
from
completing
it
chapter
xxii
and
for
his
part
to
his
uncritical
palate
the
tea
was
as
well
flavoured
from
the
clay
of
staffordshire
as
from
that
of
dresden
or
sêve
but
this
was
quite
an
old
set
purchased
two
years
ago
so
the
first
edition
and
the
hampshire
and
winchester
editions
but
bentley
emends
to
which
must
surely
be
correct
chapter
xxvi
by
ten
the
conveyed
the
two
from
the
abbey
and
after
an
agreeable
drive
of
almost
twenty
miles
they
entered
woodston
so
all
the
editions
but
is
not
a
misprint
for
general
tilney
eleanor
and
catherine
it
is
certain
that
eleanor
was
of
the
party
for
we
read
a
little
later
son
and
observations
were
of
a
different
kind
they
had
seldom
seen
him
eat
so
heartily
at
any
table
but
his
own
nor
is
there
anything
to
show
that
general
tilney
rode
on
horseback
for
an
example
of
the
use
of
the
word
by
jane
austen
see
chapter
xxix
were
now
a
miserable
trio
chapter
i
the
hampshire
and
winchester
editions
following
the
first
edition
print
the
opening
passage
as
follows
sir
walter
elliot
of
kellynch
hall
in
somersetshire
was
a
man
who
for
his
own
amusement
never
took
up
any
book
but
the
baronetage
where
he
found
occupation
for
an
idle
hour
and
consolation
in
a
distressed
one
there
his
faculties
were
roused
into
admiration
and
respect
by
contemplating
the
limited
remnant
of
the
earliest
patents
there
any
unwelcome
sensations
arising
from
domestic
affairs
changed
naturally
into
pity
and
contempt
as
he
turned
over
the
almost
endless
creations
of
the
last
century
and
there
if
every
other
leaf
were
powerless
he
could
read
his
own
history
with
an
interest
which
never
failed
this
was
the
page
at
which
his
favourite
volume
always
opened
this
obviously
makes
no
sense
as
it
stands
and
to
no
less
a
light
than
macaulay
belongs
the
credit
of
putting
it
right
some
of
his
old
friends
says
sir
trevelyan
in
his
of
may
remember
how
he
prided
himself
on
a
correction
of
his
own
in
the
first
page
of
which
he
maintained
to
be
worthy
of
bentley
and
which
undoubtedly
fulfils
all
the
conditions
required
to
establish
the
credit
of
an
emendation
for
without
the
alteration
of
a
word
or
even
of
a
letter
it
turns
into
perfectly
intelligible
a
passage
which
has
puzzled
or
which
ought
to
have
puzzled
two
generations
of
miss
austen
readers
and
in
a
footnote
sir
george
says
a
slight
change
in
the
punctuation
effects
all
that
is
required
according
to
macaulay
the
sentence
was
intended
by
its
author
to
run
thus
any
unwelcome
sensations
arising
from
domestic
affairs
changed
naturally
into
pity
and
contempt
as
he
turned
over
the
almost
endless
creations
of
the
last
century
and
there
if
every
other
leaf
were
powerless
he
could
read
his
own
history
with
an
interest
which
never
failed
this
was
the
page
at
which
his
favourite
volume
opened
whether
or
not
the
emendation
would
have
satisfied
bentley
the
critic
it
eventually
satisfied
bentley
the
publisher
who
adopted
it
in
his
later
editions
chapter
i
a
page
or
two
further
on
all
editions
read
be
it
known
then
that
sir
walter
like
a
good
father
having
met
with
one
or
two
private
disappointments
in
very
unreasonable
applications
prided
himself
on
remaining
single
for
his
dear
daughter
sake
for
one
daughter
his
eldest
he
would
really
have
given
up
anything
which
he
had
not
been
very
much
tempted
to
do
his
two
other
children
were
of
very
inferior
value
this
is
one
more
instance
of
a
misplaced
apostrophe
for
as
verrall
pointed
out
in
the
what
jane
austen
must
have
written
is
his
dear
daughters
sake
even
if
the
antithesis
implied
in
the
next
sentence
did
not
demand
this
it
is
obvious
that
the
correct
sir
walter
would
never
have
allowed
himself
to
state
that
he
remained
single
for
the
sake
of
one
daughter
only
indeed
we
have
a
proof
of
this
in
chapter
v
when
elizabeth
says
as
to
my
father
i
really
should
not
have
thought
that
he
who
has
kept
himself
single
so
long
for
our
sakes
need
be
suspected
now
chapter
xxii
bentley
following
the
first
edition
reads
she
was
earnestly
begged
to
return
and
dine
and
give
them
all
the
rest
of
the
day
but
her
spirits
had
been
so
long
exerted
that
at
present
she
felt
unequal
to
move
and
fit
only
for
home
where
she
might
be
sure
of
being
as
silent
as
she
chose
promising
to
be
with
them
the
whole
of
the
following
morning
therefore
she
closed
the
fatigues
of
the
present
by
a
toilsome
walk
to
camden
place
the
hampshire
and
winchester
editions
read
and
this
seems
likely
to
be
correct
for
those
acquainted
with
the
road
to
camden

know
how
inadvisable
it
would
be

anyone
