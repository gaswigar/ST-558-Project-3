this
book
is
affectionately
inscribed
to
my
young
friend
harry
rogers
with
recognition
of
what
he
is
and
apprehension
of
what
he
may
become
unless
he
form
himself
a
little
more
closely
upon
the
model
of
the
author
the
maxims
these
wisdoms
are
for
the
luring
of
youth
toward
high
moral
altitudes
the
author
did
not
gather
them
from
practice
but
from
observation
to
be
good
is
noble
but
to
show
others
how
to
be
good
is
nobler

the
starting
point
of
this
around
the
world
was
paris
where
we
had
been
living
a
year
or
two
we
sailed
for
america
and
there
made
certain
preparations
this
took
but
little
time
two
members
of

go

we
started
westward
from
new
york
in
midsummer
with
major
pond
to
manage
the
as
far
as
the
pacific
it
was
warm
work
all
the
way
and
the
last
fortnight
of
it
was
suffocatingly
smoky
for
in
oregon
and
columbia
the
forest
fires
were
raging
we
had
an
added
week
of
smoke
at
the
seaboard
where
we
were
obliged
awhile
for
our
ship
she
had
been
getting
herself
ashore
in
the
smoke
and
she
had
to
be
docked
and
repaired
we
sailed
at
last
and
so
ended
a
march
across
the
continent
which
had
lasted
forty
days
we
moved
westward
about
over
a
rippled
and
summer
sea
an
enticing
sea
a
clean
and
cool
sea
and
apparently
a
welcome
sea
to
all
on
board
it
certainly
was
to
the
distressful
dustings
and
smokings
and
swelterings
of
the
past
weeks
the
voyage
would
furnish
a
holiday
with
hardly
a
break
in
it
we
had
the
whole
pacific
ocean
in
front
of
us
with
nothing
to
do
but
do
nothing
and
be
comfortable
the
city
of
victoria
was
twinkling
dim
in
the
deep
heart
of
her
and
getting
ready
to
vanish
and
now
we
closed
the
and
sat
down
on
our
steamer
chairs
contented
and
at
peace
but
they
went
to
wreck
and
ruin
under
us
and
brought
us
to
shame
before
all
the
passengers
they
had
been
furnished
by
the
largest
house
in
victoria
and
were
worth
a
couple
of
farthings
a
dozen
though
they
had
cost
us
the
price
of
honest
chairs
in
the
pacific
and
indian
oceans
one
must
still
bring
his
own
on
board
or
go
without
just
as
in
the
old
forgotten
atlantic
times
those
dark
ages
of
sea
travel
ours
was
a
reasonably
comfortable
ship
with
the
customary
fare
plenty
of
good
food
furnished
by
the
deity
and
cooked
by
the
devil
the
discipline
observable
on
board
was
perhaps
as
good
as
it
is
anywhere
in
the
pacific
and
indian
oceans
the
ship
was
not
very
well
arranged
for
tropical
service
but
that
is
nothing
for
this
is
the
rule
for
ships
which
ply
in
the
tropics
she
had
an
of
cockroaches
but
this
is
also
the
rule
with
ships
doing
business
in
the
summer
seas
at
least
such
as
have
been
long
in
service
our
young
captain
was
a
very
handsome
man
tall
and
perfectly
formed
the
very
figure
to
show
up
a
smart
uniform
best
effects
he
was
a
man
of
the
best
intentions
and
was
polite
and
courteous
even
to
courtliness
there
was
a
soft
and
finish
about
his
manners
which
made
whatever
place
he
happened
to
be
in
seem
for
the
moment
a
drawing
room
he
avoided
the
smoking
room
he
had
no
vices
he
did
not
smoke
or
chew
tobacco
or
take
snuff
he
did
not
swear
or
use
slang
or
rude
or
coarse
or
indelicate
language
or
make
puns
or
tell
anecdotes
or
laugh
intemperately
or
raise
his
voice
above
the
moderate
pitch
enjoined
by
the
canons
of
good
form
when
he
gave
an
order
his
manner
modified
it
into
a
request
after
dinner
he
and
his
officers
joined
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
the
ladies
saloon
and
shared
in
the
singing
and
piano
playing
and
helped
turn
the
music
he
had
a
sweet
and
sympathetic
tenor
voice
and
used
it
with
taste
and
effect
the
music
he
played
whist
there
always
with
the
same
partner
and
opponents
until
the
ladies
bedtime
the
electric
lights
burned
there
as
late
as
the
ladies
and
their
friends
might
desire
but
they
were
not
allowed
to
burn
in
the
after
eleven
there
were
many
laws
on
the
ship
statute
book
of
course
but
so
far
as
i
could
see
this
and
one
other
were
the
only
ones
that
were
rigidly
enforced
the
captain
explained
that
he
enforced
this
one
because
his
own
cabin
adjoined
the
and
the
smell
of
tobacco
smoke
made
him
sick
i
did
not
see
how
our
smoke
could
reach
him
for
the
and
his
cabin
were
on
the
upper
deck
targets
for
all
the
winds
that
blew
and
besides
there
was
no
crack
of
communication
between
them
no
opening
of
any
sort
in
the
solid
intervening
bulkhead
still
to
a
delicate
stomach
even
imaginary
smoke
can
convey
damage
the
captain
with
his
gentle
nature
his
polish
his
sweetness
his
moral
and
verbal
purity
seemed
pathetically
out
of
place
in
his
rude
and
autocratic
vocation
it
seemed
another
instance
of
the
irony
of
fate
he
was
going
home
under
a
cloud
the
passengers
knew
about
his
trouble
and
were
sorry
for
him
approaching
vancouver
through
a
narrow
and
difficult
passage
densely
befogged
with
smoke
from
the
forest
fires
he
had
had
the
to
lose
his
bearings
and
get
his
ship
on
the
rocks
a
matter
like
this
would
rank
merely
as
an
error
with
you
and
me
it
ranks
as
a
crime
with
the
directors
of
steamship
companies
the
captain
had
been
tried
by
the
admiralty
court
at
vancouver
and
its
verdict
had
acquitted
him
of
blame
but
that
was
insufficient
comfort
a
sterner
court
would
examine
the
case
in
sydney
the
court
of
directors
the
lords
of
a
company
in
whose
ships
the
captain
had
served
as
mate
a
number
of
years
this
was
his
first
voyage
as
captain
the
officers
of
our
ship
were
hearty
and
companionable
young
men
and
they
entered
into
the
general
amusements
and
helped
the
passengers
pass
the
time
voyages
in
the
pacific
and
indian
oceans
are
but
pleasure
excursions
for
all
hands
our
purser
was
a
young
scotchman
who
was
equipped
with
a
grit
that
was
remarkable
he
was
an
invalid
and
looked
it
as
far
as
his
body
was
concerned
but
illness
could
not
subdue
his
spirit
he
was
full
of
life
and
had
a
gay
and
capable
tongue
to
all
appearances
he
was
a
sick
man
without
being
aware
of
it
for
he
did
not
talk
about
his
ailments
and
his
bearing
and
conduct
were
those
of
a
person
in
robust
health
yet
he
was
the
prey
at
intervals
of
ghastly
sieges
of
pain
in
his
heart
these
lasted
many
hours
and
while
the
attack
continued
he
could
neither
sit
nor
lie
in
one
instance
he
stood
on
his
feet
hours
fighting
for
his
life
with
these
sharp
agonies
and
yet
was
as
full
of
life
and
cheer
and
activity
the
next
day
as
if
nothing
had
happened
the
brightest
passenger
in
the
ship
and
the
most
interesting
and
felicitous
talker
was
a
young
canadian
who
was
not
able
to
let
the
whisky
bottle
alone
he
was
of
a
rich
and
powerful
family
and
could
have
had
a
distinguished
career
and
abundance
of
effective
help
toward
it
if
he
could
have
conquered
his
appetite
for
drink
but
he
could
not
do
it
so
his
great
equipment
of
talent
was
of
no
use
to
him
he
had
often
taken
the
pledge
to
drink
no
more
and
was
a
good
sample
of
what
that
sort
of
unwisdom
can
do
for
a
man
for
a
man
with
anything
short
of
an
iron
will
the
system
is
wrong
in
two
ways
it
does
not
strike
at
the
root
of
the
trouble
for
one
thing
and
to
make
a
pledge
of
any
kind
is
to
declare
war
against
nature
for
a
pledge
is
a
chain
that
is
always
clanking
and
reminding
the
wearer
of
it
that
he
is
not
a
free
man
i
have
said
that
the
system
does
not
strike
at
the
root
of
the
trouble
and
i
venture
to
repeat
that
the
root
is
not
the
drinking
but
the
desire
to
drink
these
are
very
different
things
the
one
merely
requires
will
and
a
great
deal
of
it
both
as
to
bulk
and
staying
capacity
the
other
merely
requires
watchfulness
and
for
no
long
time
the
desire
of
course
precedes
the
act
and
should
have
one
first
attention
it
can
do
but
little
good
to
refuse
the
act
over
and
over
again
always
leaving
the
desire
unmolested
unconquered
the
desire
will
continue
to
assert
itself
and
will
be
almost
sure
to
win
in
the
long
run
when
the
desire
intrudes
it
should
be
at
once
banished
out
of
the
mind
one
should
be
on
the
watch
for
it
all
the
time
otherwise
it
will
get
in
it
must
be
taken
in
time
and
not
allowed
to
get
a
lodgment
a
desire
constantly
repulsed
for
a
fortnight
should
die
then
that
should
cure
the
drinking
habit
the
system
of
refusing
the
mere
act
of
drinking
and
leaving
the
desire
in
full
force
is
unintelligent
war
tactics
it
seems
to
me
i
used
to
take
pledges
and
soon
violate
them
my
will
was
not
strong
and
i
could
not
help
it
and
then
to
be
tied
in
any
way
naturally
irks
an
otherwise
free
person
and
makes
him
chafe
in
his
bonds
and
want
to
get
his
liberty
but
when
i
finally
ceased
from
taking
definite
pledges
and
merely
resolved
that
i
would
kill
an
injurious
desire
but
leave
myself
free
to
resume
the
desire
and
the
habit
whenever
i
should
choose
to
do
so
i
had
no
more
trouble
in
five
days
i
drove
out
the
desire
to
smoke
and
was
not
obliged
to
keep
watch
after
that
and
i
never
experienced
any
strong
desire
to
smoke
again
at
the
end
of
a
year
and
a
quarter
of
idleness
i
began
to
write
a
book
and
presently
found
that
the
pen
was
strangely
reluctant
to
go
i
tried
a
smoke
to
see
if
that
would
help
me
out
of
the
difficulty
it
did
i
smoked
eight
or
ten
cigars
and
as
many
pipes
a
day
for
five
months
finished
the
book
and
did
not
smoke
again
until
a
year
had
gone
by
and
another
book
had
to
be
begun
i
can
quit
any
of
my
nineteen
injurious
habits
at
any
time
and
without
discomfort
or
inconvenience
i
think
that
the
tanners
and
those
others
who
go
forty
days
without
eating
do
it
by
resolutely
keeping
out
the
desire
to
eat
in
the
beginning
and
that
after
a
few
hours
the
desire
is
discouraged
and
comes
no
more
once
i
tried
my
scheme
in
a
large
medical
way
i
had
been
confined
to
my
bed
several
days
with
lumbago
my
case
refused
to
improve
finally
the
doctor
said
my
remedies
have
no
fair
chance
consider
what
they
have
to
fight
besides
the
lumbago
you
smoke
extravagantly
do
you
yes
you
take
coffee
immoderately
yes
and
some
tea
yes
you
eat
all
kinds
of
things
that
are
dissatisfied
with
each
company
yes
you
drink
two
hot
scotches
every
night
yes
very
well
there
you
see
what
i
have
to
contend
against
we
ca
make
progress
the
way
the
matter
stands
you
must
make
a
reduction
in
these
things
you
must
cut
down
your
consumption
of
them
considerably
for
some
days
i
ca
doctor
why
ca
you
i
lack
the
i
can
cut
them
off
entirely
but
i
ca
merely
moderate
them
he
said
that
that
would
answer
and
said
he
would
come
around
in
hours
and
begin
work
again
he
was
taken
ill
himself
and
could
not
come
but
i
did
not
need
him
i
cut
off
all
those
things
for
two
days
and
nights
in
fact
i
cut
off
all
kinds
of
food
too
and
all
drinks
except
water
and
at
the
end
of
the
hours
the
lumbago
was
discouraged
and
left
me
i
was
a
well
man
so
i
gave
thanks
and
took
to
those
delicacies
again
it
seemed
a
valuable
medical
course
and
i
recommended
it
to
a
lady
she
had
run
down
and
down
and
down
and
had
at
last
reached
a
point
where
medicines
no
longer
had
any
helpful
effect
upon
her
i
said
i
knew
i
could
put
her
upon
her
feet
in
a
week
it
brightened
her
up
it
filled
her
with
hope
and
she
said
she
would
do
everything
i
told
her
to
do
so
i
said
she
must
stop
swearing
and
drinking
and
smoking
and
eating
for
four
days
and
then
she
would
be
all
right
again
and
it
would
have
happened
just
so
i
know
it
but
she
said
she
could
not
stop
swearing
and
smoking
and
drinking
because
she
had
never
done
those
things
so
there
it
was
she
had
neglected
her
habits
and
had
any
now
that
they
would
have
come
good
there
were
none
in
stock
she
had
nothing
to
fall
back
on
she
was
a
sinking
vessel
with
no
freight
in
her
to
throw
over
lighten
ship
withal
why
even
one
or
two
little
bad
habits
could
have
saved
her
but
she
was
just
a
moral
pauper
when
she
could
have
acquired
them
she
was
dissuaded
by
her
parents
who
were
ignorant
people
though
reared
in
the
best
society
and
it
was
too
late
to
begin
now
it
seemed
such
a
pity
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
these
things
ought
to
be
attended
to
while
a
person
is
young
otherwise
when
age
and
disease
come
there
is
nothing
effectual
to
fight
them
with
when
i
was
a
youth
i
used
to
take
all
kinds
of
pledges
and
do
my
best
to
keep
them
but
i
never
could
because
i
did
strike
at
the
root
of
the
habit
the
desire
i
generally
broke
down
within
the
month
once
i
tried
limiting
a
habit
that
worked
tolerably
well
for
a
while
i
pledged
myself
to
smoke
but
one
cigar
a
day
i
kept
the
cigar
waiting
until
bedtime
then
i
had
a
luxurious
time
with
it
but
desire
persecuted
me
every
day
and
all
day
long
so
within
the
week
i
found
myself
hunting
for
larger
cigars
than
i
had
been
used
to
smoke
then
larger
ones
still
and
still
larger
ones
within
the
fortnight
i
was
getting
cigars
made
for
me
on
a
yet
larger
pattern
they
still
grew
and
grew
in
size
within
the
month
my
cigar
had
grown
to
such
proportions
that
i
could
have
used
it
as
a
crutch
it
now
seemed
to
me
that
a
limit
was
no
real
protection
to
a
person
so
i
knocked
my
pledge
on
the
head
and
resumed
my
liberty
to
go
back
to
that
young
canadian
he
was
a
remittance
man
the
first
one
i
had
ever
seen
or
heard
of
passengers
explained
the
term
to
me
they
said
that
dissipated
belonging
to
important
families
in
england
and
canada
were
not
cast
off
by
their
people
while
there
was
any
hope
of
reforming
them
but
when
that
last
hope
perished
at
last
the
was
sent
abroad
to
get
him
out
of
the
way
he
was
shipped
off
with
just
enough
money
in
his
pocket
no
in
the
purser
pocket
for
the
needs
of
the
voyage
and
when
he
reached
his
destined
port
he
would
find
a
remittance
awaiting
him
there
not
a
large
one
but
just
enough
to
keep
him
a
month
a
similar
remittance
would
come
monthly
thereafter
it
was
the
custom
to
pay
his
month
board
and
lodging
straightway
a
duty
which
his
landlord
did
not
allow
him
to
forget
then
spree
away
the
rest
of
his
money
in
a
single
night
then
brood
and
mope
and
grieve
in
idleness
till
the
next
remittance
came
it
is
a
pathetic
life
we
had
other
on
board
it
was
said
at
least
they
said
they
were
there
were
two
but
they
did
not
resemble
the
canadian
they
lacked
his
tidiness
and
his
brains
and
his
gentlemanly
ways
and
his
resolute
spirit
and
his
humanities
and
generosities
one
of
them
was
a
lad
of
nineteen
or
twenty
and
he
was
a
good
deal
of
a
ruin
as
to
clothes
and
morals
and
general
aspect
he
said
he
was
a
scion
of
a
ducal
house
in
england
and
had
been
shipped
to
canada
for
the
house
relief
that
he
had
fallen
into
trouble
there
and
was
now
being
shipped
to
australia
he
said
he
had
no
title
beyond
this
remark
he
was
economical
of
the
truth
the
first
thing
he
did
in
australia
was
to
get
into
the
lockup
and
the
next
thing
he
did
was
to
proclaim
himself
an
earl
in
the
police
court
in
the
morning
and
fail
to
prove
it

wilson

about
four
days
out
from
victoria
we
plunged
into
hot
weather
and
all
the
male
passengers
put
on
white
linen
clothes
one
or
two
days
later
we
crossed
the
parallel
of
north
latitude
and
then
by
order
the
officers
of
the
ship
laid
away
their
blue
uniforms
and
came
out
in
white
linen
ones
all
the

were
in

by
this
time
this
prevalence
of
snowy
costumes
gave
the

an
invitingly
cool
and
cheerful
and
picnicky
aspect
from
my
diary
there
are
several
sorts
of
ills
in
the
world
from
which
a
person
can
never
escape
altogether
let
him
journey
as
far
as
he
will
one
escapes
from
one
breed
of
an
ill
only
to
encounter
another
breed
of
it
we
have
come
far
from
the
snake
liar
and
the
fish
liar
and
there
was
rest
and
peace
in
the
thought
but
now
we
have
reached
the
realm
of
the
boomerang
liar
and
sorrow
is
with
us
once
more
the
first
officer
has
seen
a
man
try
to
escape
from
his
enemy
by
getting
behind
a
tree
but
the
enemy
sent
his
boomerang
sailing
into
the
sky
far
above
and
beyond
the
tree
then
it
turned
descended
and
killed
the
man
the
australian
passenger
has
seen
this
thing
done
to
two
men
behind
two
trees
and
by
the
one
arrow
this
being
received
with
a
large
silence
that
suggested
doubt
he
buttressed
it
with
the
statement
that
his
brother
once
saw
the
boomerang
kill
a
bird
away
off
a
hundred
yards
and
bring
it
to
the
thrower
but
these
are
ills
which
must
be
borne
there
is
no
other
way
the
talk
passed
from
the
boomerang
to
dreams
usually
a
fruitful
subject
afloat
or
ashore
but
this
time
the
output
was
poor
then
it
passed
to
instances
of
extraordinary
memory
with
better
results
blind
tom
the
negro
pianist
was
spoken
of
and
it
was
said
that
he
could
accurately
play
any
piece
of
music
howsoever
long
and
difficult
after
hearing
it
once
and
that
six
months
later
he
could
accurately
play
it
again
without
having
touched
it
in
the
interval
one
of
the
most
striking
of
the
stories
told
was
furnished
by
a
gentleman
who
had
served
on
the
staff
of
the
viceroy
of
india
he
read
the
details
from
his
and
explained
that
he
had
written
them
down
right
after
the
consummation
of
the
incident
which
they
described
because
he
thought
that
if
he
did
not
put
them
down
in
black
and
white
he
might
presently
come
to
think
he
had
dreamed
them
or
invented
them
the
viceroy
was
making
a
progress
and
among
the
shows
offered
by
the
maharajah
of
mysore
for
his
entertainment
was
a
the
viceroy
and
thirty
gentlemen
of
his
suite
sat
in
a
row
and
the
a
brahmin
was
brought
in
and
seated
on
the
floor
in
front
of
them
he
said
he
knew
but
two
languages
the
english
and
his
own
but
would
not
exclude
any
foreign
tongue
from
the
tests
to
be
applied
to
his
memory
then
he
laid
before
the
assemblage
his
program
a
sufficiently
extraordinary
one
he
proposed
that
one
gentleman
should
give
him
one
word
of
a
foreign
sentence
and
tell
him
its
place
in
the
sentence
he
was
furnished
with
the
french
word
and
was
told
it
was
second
in
a
sentence
of
three
words
the
next
gentleman
gave
him
the
german
word
and
said
it
was
the
third
in
a
sentence
of
four
words
he
asked
the
next
gentleman
for
one
detail
in
a
sum
in
addition
another
for
one
detail
in
a
sum
of
subtraction
others
for
single
details
in
mathematical
problems
of
various
kinds
he
got
them
intermediates
gave
him
single
words
from
sentences
in
greek
latin
spanish
portuguese
italian
and
other
languages
and
told
him
their
places
in
the
sentences
when
at
last
everybody
had
furnished
him
a
single
rag
from
a
foreign
sentence
or
a
figure
from
a
problem
he
went
over
the
ground
again
and
got
a
second
word
and
a
second
figure
and
was
told
their
places
in
the
sentences
and
the
sums
and
so
on
and
so
on
he
went
over
the
ground
again
and
again
until
he
had
collected
all
the
parts
of
the
sums
and
all
the
parts
of
the
sentences
and
all
in
disorder
of
course
not
in
their
proper
rotation
this
had
occupied
two
hours
the
brahmin
now
sat
silent
and
thinking
a
while
then
began
and
repeated
all
the
sentences
placing
the
words
in
their
proper
order
and
untangled
the
disordered
arithmetical
problems
and
gave
accurate
answers
to
them
all
in
the
beginning
he
had
asked
the
company
to
throw
almonds
at
him
during
the
two
hours
he
to
remember
how
many
each
gentleman
had
thrown
but
none
were
thrown
for
the
viceroy
said
that
the
test
would
be
a
sufficiently
severe
strain
without
adding
that
burden
to
it
general
grant
had
a
fine
memory
for
all
kinds
of
things
including
even
names
and
faces
and
i
could
have
furnished
an
instance
of
it
if
i
had
thought
of
it
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
him
was
early
in
his
first
term
as
president
i
had
just
arrived
in
washington
from
the
pacific
coast
a
stranger
and
wholly
unknown
to
the
public
and
was
passing
the
white
house
one
morning
when
i
met
a
friend
a
senator
from
nevada
he
asked
me
if
i
would
like
to
see
the
president
i
said
i
should
be
very
glad
so
we
entered
i
supposed
that
the
president
would
be
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
and
that
i
could
look
at
him
in
peace
and
security
from
a
distance
as
another
stray
cat
might
look
at
another
king
but
it
was
in
the
morning
and
the
senator
was
using
a
privilege
of
his
office
which
i
had
not
heard
of
the
privilege
of
intruding
upon
the
chief
working
hours
before
i
knew
it
the
senator
and
i
were
in
the
presence
and
there
was
none
there
but
we
three
general
grant
got
slowly
up
from
his
table
put
his
pen
down
and
stood
before
me
with
the
iron
expression
of
a
man
who
had
not
smiled
for
seven
years
and
was
not
intending
to
smile
for
another
seven
he
looked
me
steadily
in
the
eyes
mine
lost
confidence
and
fell
i
had
never
confronted
a
great
man
before
and
was
in
a
miserable
state
of
funk
and
inefficiency
the
senator
said
president
may
i
have
the
privilege
of
introducing
mr
clemens
the
president
gave
my
hand
an
unsympathetic
wag
and
dropped
it
he
did
not
say
a
word
but
just
stood
in
my
trouble
i
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
i
merely
wanted
to
resign
there
was
an
awkward
pause
a
dreary
pause
a
horrible
pause
then
i
thought
of
something
and
looked
up
into
that
unyielding
face
and
said
timidly
president
i
i
am
embarrassed
are
you
his
face
broke
just
a
little
a
wee
glimmer
the
momentary
flicker
of
a
smile
seven
years
ahead
of
time
and
i
was
out
and
gone
as
soon
as
it
was
ten
years
passed
away
before
i
saw
him
the
second
time
meantime
i
was
become
better
known
and
was
one
of
the
people
appointed
to
respond
to
toasts
at
the
banquet
given
to
general
grant
in
chicago
by
the
army
of
the
tennessee
when
he
came
back
from
his
tour
around
the
world
i
arrived
late
at
night
and
got
up
late
in
the
morning
all
the
corridors
of
the
hotel
were
crowded
with
people
waiting
to
get
a
glimpse
of
general
grant
when
he
should
pass
to
the
place
whence
he
was
to
review
the
great
procession
i
worked
my
way
by
the
suite
of
packed
and
at
the
corner
of
the
house
i
found
a
window
open
where
there
was
a
roomy
platform
decorated
with
flags
and
carpeted
i
stepped
out
on
it
and
saw
below
me
millions
of
people
blocking
all
the
streets
and
other
millions
caked
together
in
all
the
windows
and
on
all
the
around
these
masses
took
me
for
general
grant
and
broke
into
volcanic
explosions
and
cheers
but
it
was
a
good
place
to
see
the
procession
and
i
stayed
presently
i
heard
the
distant
blare
of
military
music
and
far
up
the
street
i
saw
the
procession
come
in
sight
cleaving
its
way
through
the
huzzaing
multitudes
with
sheridan
the
most
martial
figure
of
the
war
riding
at
its
head
in
the
dress
uniform
of
a
and
now
general
grant
with
major
carter
harrison
stepped
out
on
the
platform
followed
two
and
two
by
the
badged
and
uniformed
reception
committee
general
grant
was
looking
exactly
as
he
had
looked
upon
that
trying
occasion
of
ten
years
before
all
iron
and
bronze
harrison
came
over
and
led
me
to
the
general
and
formally
introduced
me
before
i
could
put
together
the
proper
remark
general
grant
said
clemens
i
am
not
embarrassed
are
you
and
that
little
smile
twinkled
across
his
face
again
seventeen
years
have
gone
by
since
then
and
in
new
york
the
streets
are
a
crush
of
people
who
are
there
to
honor
the
remains
of
the
great
soldier
as
they
pass
to
their
final
under
the
monument
and
the
air
is
heavy
with
dirges
and
the
boom
of
artillery
and
all
the
millions
of
america
are
thinking
of
the
man
who
restored
the
union
and
the
flag
and
gave
to
democratic
government
a
new
lease
of
life
and
as
we
may
hope
and
do
believe
a
permanent
place
among
the
beneficent
institutions
of
men
we
had
one
game
in
the
ship
which
was
a
good
at
least
it
was
at
night
in
the
when
the
men
were
getting
freshened
up
from
the
day
monotonies
and
dullnesses
it
was
the
completing
of
stories
that
is
to
say
a
man
would
tell
all
of
a
story
except
the
finish
then
the
others
would
try
to
supply
the
ending
out
of
their
own
invention
when
every
one
who
wanted
a
chance
had
had
it
the
man
who
had
introduced
the
story
would
give
it
its
original
ending
then
you
could
take
your
choice
sometimes
the
new
endings
turned
out
to
be
better
than
the
old
one
but
the
story
which
called
out
the
most
persistent
and
determined
and
ambitious
effort
was
one
which
had
no
ending
and
so
there
was
nothing
to
compare
the
endings
with
the
man
who
told
it
said
he
could
furnish
the
particulars
up
to
a
certain
point
only
because
that
was
as
much
of
the
tale
as
he
knew
he
had
read
it
in
a
volume
of
years
ago
and
was
interrupted
before
the
end
was
reached
he
would
give
any
one
fifty
dollars
who
would
finish
the
story
to
the
satisfaction
of
a
jury
to
be
appointed
by
ourselves
we
appointed
a
jury
and
wrestled
with
the
tale
we
invented
plenty
of
endings
but
the
jury
voted
them
all
down
the
jury
was
right
it
was
a
tale
which
the
author
of
it
may
possibly
have
completed
satisfactorily
and
if
he
really
had
that
good
fortune
i
would
like
to
know
what
the
ending
was
any
ordinary
man
will
find
that
the
strength
is
in
its
middle
and
that
there
is
apparently
no
way
to
transfer
it
to
the
close
where
of
course
it
ought
to
be
in
substance
the
storiette
was
as
follows
john
brown
aged
good
gentle
bashful
timid
lived
in
a
quiet
village
in
missouri
he
was
superintendent
of
the
presbyterian
it
was
but
a
humble
distinction
still
it
was
his
only
official
one
and
he
was
modestly
proud
of
it
and
was
devoted
to
its
work
and
its
interests
the
extreme
kindliness
of
his
nature
was
recognized
by
all
in
fact
people
said
that
he
was
made
entirely
out
of
good
impulses
and
bashfulness
that
he
could
always
be
counted
upon
for
help
when
it
was
needed
and
for
bashfulness
both
when
it
was
needed
and
when
it
was
mary
taylor
modest
sweet
winning
and
in
character
and
person
beautiful
was
all
in
all
to
him
and
he
was
very
nearly
all
in
all
to
her
she
was
wavering
his
hopes
were
high
her
mother
had
been
in
opposition
from
the
first
but
she
was
wavering
too
he
could
see
it
she
was
being
touched
by
his
warm
interest
in
her
two
and
by
his
contributions
toward
their
support
these
were
two
forlorn
and
aged
sisters
who
lived
in
a
log
hut
in
a
lonely
place
up
a
cross
road
four
miles
from
taylor
farm
one
of
the
sisters
was
crazy
and
sometimes
a
little
violent
but
not
often
at
last
the
time
seemed
ripe
for
a
final
advance
and
brown
gathered
his
courage
together
and
resolved
to
make
it
he
would
take
along
a
contribution
of
double
the
usual
size
and
win
the
mother
over
with
her
opposition
annulled
the
rest
of
the
conquest
would
be
sure
and
prompt
he
took
to
the
road
in
the
middle
of
a
placid
sunday
afternoon
in
the
soft
missourian
summer
and
he
was
equipped
properly
for
his
mission
he
was
clothed
all
in
white
linen
with
a
blue
ribbon
for
a
necktie
and
he
had
on
dressy
tight
boots
his
horse
and
buggy
were
the
finest
that
the
livery
stable
could
furnish
the
lap
robe
was
of
white
linen
it
was
new
and
it
had
a
border
that
could
not
be
rivaled
in
that
region
for
beauty
and
elaboration
when
he
was
four
miles
out
on
the
lonely
road
and
was
walking
his
horse
over
a
wooden
bridge
his
straw
hat
blew
off
and
fell
in
the
creek
and
floated
down
and
lodged
against
a
bar
he
did
not
quite
know
what
to
do
he
must
have
the
hat
that
was
manifest
but
how
was
he
to
get
it
then
he
had
an
idea
the
roads
were
empty
nobody
was
stirring
yes
he
would
risk
it
he
led
the
horse
to
the
roadside
and
set
it
to
cropping
the
grass
then
he
undressed
and
put
his
clothes
in
the
buggy
petted
the
horse
a
moment
to
secure
its
compassion
and
its
loyalty
then
hurried
to
the
stream
he
swam
out
and
soon
had
the
hat
when
he
got
to
the
top
of
the
bank
the
horse
was
gone
his
legs
almost
gave
way
under
him
the
horse
was
walking
leisurely
along
the
road
brown
trotted
after
it
saying
whoa
whoa
there
a
good
fellow
but
whenever
he
got
near
enough
to
chance
a
jump
for
the
buggy
the
horse
quickened
its
pace
a
little
and
defeated
him
and
so
this
went
on
the
naked
man
perishing
with
anxiety
and
expecting
every
moment
to
see
people
come
in
sight
he
tagged
on
and
on
imploring
the
horse
beseeching
the
horse
till
he
had
left
a
mile
behind
him
and
was
closing
up
on
the
taylor
premises
then
at
last
he
was
successful
and
got
into
the
buggy
he
flung
on
his
shirt
his
necktie
and
his
coat
then
reached
for
but
he
was
too
late
he
sat
suddenly
down
and
pulled
up
the
for
he
saw
some
one
coming
out
of
the
gate
a
woman
he
thought
he
wheeled
the
horse
to
the
left
and
struck
briskly
up
the
it
was
perfectly
straight
and
exposed
on
both
sides
but
there
were
woods
and
a
sharp
turn
three
miles
ahead
and
he
was
very
grateful
when
he
got
there
as
he
passed
around
the
turn
he
slowed
down
to
a
walk
and
reached
for
his
tr
too
late
again
he
had
come
upon
enderby
glossop
taylor
and
mary
they
were
on
foot
and
seemed
tired
and
excited
they
came
at
once
to
the
buggy
and
shook
hands
and
all
spoke
at
once
and
said
eagerly
and
earnestly
how
glad
they
were
that
he
was
come
and
how
fortunate
it
was
and
enderby
said
impressively
it
looks
like
an
accident
his
coming
at
such
a
time
but
let
no
one
profane
it
with
such
a
name
he
was
sent
sent
from
on
high
they
were
all
moved
and
glossop
said
in
an
awed
voice
sarah
enderby
you
never
said
a
truer
word
in
your
life
this
is
no
accident
it
is
a
special
providence
he
was
sent
he
is
an
angel
an
angel
as
truly
as
ever
angel
was
an
angel
of
deliverance
i
say
angel
sarah
enderby
and
will
have
no
other
word
do
let
any
one
ever
say
to
me
again
that
there
no
such
thing
as
special
providences
for
if
this
is
one
let
them
account
for
it
that
can
i
know
it
so
said
taylor
fervently
john
brown
i
could
worship
you
i
could
go
down
on
my
knees
to
you
did
something
tell
you
did
you
feel
that
you
were
sent
i
could
kiss
the
hem
of
your
laprobe
he
was
not
able
to
speak
he
was
helpless
with
shame
and
fright
taylor
went
on
why
just
look
at
it
all
around
julia
glossop
any
person
can
see
the
hand
of
providence
in
it
here
at
noon
what
do
we
see
we
see
the
smoke
rising
i
speak
up
and
say
the
old
people
cabin
afire
did
i
julia
glossop
the
very
words
you
said
nancy
taylor
i
was
as
close
to
you
as
i
am
now
and
i
heard
them
you
may
have
said
hut
instead
of
cabin
but
in
substance
it
the
same
and
you
were
looking
pale
too
pale
i
was
that
pale
that
if
why
you
just
compare
it
with
this
laprobe
then
the
next
thing
i
said
was
taylor
tell
the
hired
man
to
rig
up
the
go
to
the
rescue
and
she
said
do
you
know
you
told
him
he
could
drive
to
see
his
people
and
stay
over
sunday
and
it
was
just
so
i
declare
for
it
i
had
forgotten
it
said
i
go
afoot
and
go
we
did
and
found
sarah
enderby
on
the
road
and
we
all
went
together
said
enderby
and
found
the
cabin
set
fire
to
and
burnt
down
by
the
crazy
one
and
the
poor
old
things
so
old
and
feeble
that
they
could
go
afoot
and
we
got
them
to
a
shady
place
and
made
them
as
comfortable
as
we
could
and
began
to
wonder
which
way
to
turn
to
find
some
way
to
get
them
conveyed
to
nancy
taylor
house
and
i
spoke
up
and
said
now
what
did
i
say
did
i
say
will
provide
why
sure
as
you
live
so
you
did
i
had
forgotten
it
so
had
i
said
glossop
and
taylor
but
you
certainly
said
it
now
was
that
remarkable
yes
i
said
it
and
then
we
went
to
moseley
two
miles
and
all
of
them
were
gone
to
the
camp
meeting
over
on
stony
fork
and
then
we
came
all
the
way
back
two
miles
and
then
here
another
mile
and
providence
has
provided
you
see
it
yourselves
they
gazed
at
each
other
and
lifted
their
hands
and
said
in
unison
it
wonderful
and
then
said
glossop
what
do
you
think
we
had
better
do
let
brown
drive
the
old
people
to
nancy
taylor
one
at
a
time
or
put
both
of
them
in
the
buggy
and
him
lead
the
horse
brown
gasped
now
then
that
a
question
said
enderby
you
see
we
are
all
tired
out
and
any
way
we
fix
it
it
going
to
be
difficult
for
if
brown
takes
both
of
them
at
least
one
of
us
must
go
back
to
help
him
for
he
ca
load
them
into
the
buggy
by
himself
and
they
so
helpless
that
is
so
said
taylor
it
does
how
would
this
do
one
of
us
drive
there
with
brown
and
the
rest
of
you
go
along
to
my
house
and
get
things
ready
i
go
with
him
he
and
i
together
can
lift
one
of
the
old
people
into
the
buggy
then
drive
her
to
my
house
and
but
who
will
take
care
of
the
other
one
said
enderby
we
mus
leave
her
there
in
the
woods
alone
you
know
especially
the
crazy
one
there
and
back
is
eight
miles
you
see
they
had
all
been
sitting
on
the
grass
beside
the
buggy
for
a
while
now
trying
to
rest
their
weary
bodies
they
fell
silent
a
moment
or
two
and
struggled
in
thought
over
the
baffling
situation
then
enderby
brightened
and
said
i
think
i
got
the
idea
now
you
see
we
ca
walk
any
more
think
what
we
done
four
miles
there
two
to
moseley
is
six
then
back
to
here
nine
miles
since
noon
and
not
a
bite
to
eat
i
declare
i
do
see
how
we
done
it
and
as
for
me
i
am
just
famishing
now
got
to
go
back
to
help
brown
there
no
getting
mound
that
but
whoever
goes
has
got
to
ride
not
walk
so
my
idea
is
this
one
of
us
to
ride
back
with
brown
then
ride
to
nancy
taylor
house
with
one
of
the
old
people
leaving
brown
to
keep
the
other
old
one
company
you
all
to
go
now
to
nancy
and
rest
and
wait
then
one
of
you
drive
back
and
get
the
other
one
and
drive
her
to
nancy
and
brown
walk
splendid
they
all
cried
oh
that
will
do
that
will
answer
perfectly
and
they
all
said
that
enderby
had
the
best
head
for
planning
in
the
company
and
they
said
that
they
wondered
that
they
had
thought
of
this
simple
plan
themselves
they
had
meant
to
take
back
the
compliment
good
simple
souls
and
did
know
they
had
done
it
after
a
consultation
it
was
decided
that
enderby
should
drive
back
with
brown
she
being
entitled
to
the
distinction
because
she
had
invented
the
plan
everything
now
being
satisfactorily
arranged
and
settled
the
ladies
rose
relieved
and
happy
and
brushed
down
their
gowns
and
three
of
them
started
homeward
enderby
set
her
foot
on
the
and
was
about
to
climb
in
when
brown
found
a
remnant
of
his
voice
and
gasped
out
please
enderby
call
them
back
i
am
very
weak
i
ca
walk
i
ca
indeed
why
dear
brown
you
do
look
pale
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
that
i
did
notice
it
sooner
come
of
you
brown
is
not
well
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
mr
brown
i
real
sorry
are
you
in
pain
no
madam
only
weak
i
am
not
sick
but
only
just
weak
lately
not
long
but
just
lately
the
others
came
back
and
poured
out
their
sympathies
and
commiserations
and
were
full
of
for
not
having
noticed
how
pale
he
was
and
they
at
once
struck
out
a
new
plan
and
soon
agreed
that
it
was
by
far
the
best
of
all
they
would
all
go
to
nancy
taylor
house
and
see
to
brown
needs
first
he
could
lie
on
the
sofa
in
the
parlor
and
while
taylor
and
mary
took
care
of
him
the
other
two
ladies
would
take
the
buggy
and
go
and
get
one
of
the
old
people
and
leave
one
of
themselves
with
the
other
one
and
by
this
time
without
any
solicitation
they
were
at
the
horse
head
and
were
beginning
to
turn
him
around
the
danger
was
imminent
but
brown
found
his
voice
again
and
saved
himself
he
said
but
ladies
you
are
overlooking
something
which
makes
the
plan
impracticable
you
see
if
you
bring
one
of
them
home
and
one
remains
behind
with
the
other
there
will
be
three
persons
there
when
one
of
you
comes
back
for
that
other
for
some
one
must
drive
the
buggy
back
and
three
ca
come
home
in
it
they
all
exclaimed
why
that
is
so
and
they
were
all
perplexed
again
dear
dear
what
can
we
do
said
glossop
it
is
the
most
thing
that
ever
was
the
fox
and
the
goose
and
the
corn
and
things
oh
dear
they
are
nothing
to
it
they
sat
wearily
down
once
more
to
further
torture
their
tormented
heads
for
a
plan
that
would
work
presently
mary
offered
a
plan
it
was
her
first
effort
she
said
i
am
young
and
strong
and
am
refreshed
now
take
brown
to
our
house
and
give
him
help
you
see
how
plainly
he
needs
it
i
will
go
back
and
take
care
of
the
old
people
i
can
be
there
in
twenty
minutes
you
can
go
on
and
do
what
you
first
started
to
do
wait
on
the
main
road
at
our
house
until
somebody
comes
along
with
a
wagon
then
send
and
bring
away
the
three
of
us
you
wo
have
to
wait
long
the
farmers
will
soon
be
coming
back
from
town
now
i
will
keep
old
polly
patient
and
cheered
up
the
crazy
one
does
need
it
this
plan
was
discussed
and
accepted
it
seemed
the
best
that
could
be
done
in
the
circumstances
and
the
old
people
must
be
getting
discouraged
by
this
time
brown
felt
relieved
and
was
deeply
thankful
let
him
once
get
to
the
main
road
and
he
would
find
a
way
to
escape
then
taylor
said
the
evening
chill
will
be
coming
on
pretty
soon
and
those
poor
old
things
will
need
some
kind
of
covering
take
the
with
you
dear
very
well
mother
i
will
she
stepped
to
the
buggy
and
put
out
her
hand
to
take
it
that
was
the
end
of
the
tale
the
passenger
who
told
it
said
that
when
he
read
the
story
years
ago
in
a
train
he
was
interrupted
at
that
point
the
train
jumped
off
a
bridge
at
first
we
thought
we
could
finish
the
story
quite
easily
and
we
set
to
work
with
confidence
but
it
soon
began
to
appear
that
it
was
not
a
simple
thing
but
difficult
and
baffling
this
was
on
account
of
character
great
generosity
and
kindliness
but
complicated
with
unusual
shyness
and
diffidence
particularly
in
the
presence
of
ladies
there
was
his
love
for
mary
in
a
hopeful
state
but
not
yet
secure
just
in
a
condition
indeed
where
its
affair
must
be
handled
with
great
tact
and
no
mistakes
made
no
offense
given
and
there
was
the
mother
wavering
half
adroit
and
flawless
diplomacy
to
be
won
over
now
or
perhaps
never
at
all
also
there
were
the
helpless
old
people
yonder
in
the
woods
fate
and
brown
happiness
to
be
determined
by
what
brown
should
do
within
the
next
two
seconds
mary
was
reaching
for
the
brown
must
was
no
time
to
be
lost
of
course
none
but
a
happy
ending
of
the
story
would
be
accepted
by
the
jury
the
finish
must
find
brown
in
high
credit
with
the
ladies
his
behavior
without
blemish
his
modesty
unwounded
his
character
for
self
sacrifice
maintained
the
old
people
rescued
through
him
their
benefactor
all
the
party
proud
of
him
happy
in
him
his
praises
on
all
their
tongues
we
tried
to
arrange
this
but
it
was
beset
with
persistent
and
irreconcilable
difficulties
we
saw
that
brown
shyness
would
not
allow
him
to
give
up
the
this
would
offend
mary
and
her
mother
and
it
would
surprise
the
other
ladies
partly
because
this
stinginess
toward
the
suffering
old
people
would
be
out
of
character
with
brown
and
partly
because
he
was
a
special
providence
and
could
not
properly
act
so
if
asked
to
explain
his
conduct
his
shyness
would
not
allow
him
to
tell
the
truth
and
lack
of
invention
and
practice
would
find
him
incapable
of
contriving
a
lie
that
would
we
worked
at
the
troublesome
problem
until
three
in
the
morning
meantime
mary
was
still
reaching
for
the
we
gave
it
up
and
decided
to
let
her
continue
to
reach
it
is
the
reader
privilege
to
determine
for
himself
how
the
thing
came
out
chapter

it
is
more
trouble
to
make
a
maxim
than
it
is
to
do
right
wilson
new
calendar
on
the
seventh
day
out
we
saw
a
dim
vast
bulk
standing
up
out
of
the
wastes
of
the
pacific
and
knew
that
that
spectral
promontory
was
diamond
head
a
piece
of
this
world
which
i
had
not
seen
before
for
years
so
we
were
nearing
honolulu
the
capital
city
of
the
sandwich
islands
those
islands
which
to
me
were
paradise
a
paradise
which
i
had
been
longing
all
those
years
to
see
again
not
any
other
thing
in
the
world
could
have
stirred
me
as
the
sight
of
that
great
rock
did
in
the
night
we
anchored
a
mile
from
shore
through
my
port
i
could
see
the
twinkling
lights
of
honolulu
and
the
dark
bulk
of
the
that
stretched
away
right
and
left
i
could
not
make
out
the
beautiful
nuuana
valley
but
i
knew
where
it
lay
and
remembered
how
it
used
to
look
in
the
old
times
we
used
to
ride
up
it
on
horseback
in
those
days
we
young
people
and
branch
off
and
gather
bones
in
a
sandy
region
where
one
of
the
first
kamehameha
battles
was
fought
he
was
a
remarkable
man
for
a
king
and
he
was
also
a
remarkable
man
for
a
savage
he
was
a
mere
kinglet
and
of
little
or
no
consequence
at
the
time
of
captain
cook
arrival
in
but
about
four
years
afterward
he
conceived
the
idea
of
enlarging
his
sphere
of
influence
that
is
a
courteous
modern
phrase
which
means
robbing
your
neighbor
for
your
neighbor
benefit
and
the
great
theater
of
its
benevolences
is
africa
kamehameha
went
to
war
and
in
the
course
of
ten
years
he
whipped
out
all
the
other
kings
and
made
himself
master
of
every
one
of
the
nine
or
ten
islands
that
form
the
group
but
he
did
more
than
that
he
bought
ships
freighted
them
with
sandal
wood
and
other
native
products
and
sent
them
as
far
as
south
america
and
china
he
sold
to
his
savages
the
foreign
stuffs
and
tools
and
utensils
which
came
back
in
these
ships
and
started
the
march
of
civilization
it
is
doubtful
if
the
match
to
this
extraordinary
thing
is
to
be
found
in
the
history
of
any
other
savage
savages
are
eager
to
learn
from
the
white
man
any
new
way
to
kill
each
other
but
it
is
not
their
habit
to
seize
with
avidity
and
apply
with
energy
the
larger
and
nobler
ideas
which
he
offers
them
the
details
of
kamehameha
history
show
that
he
was
always
hospitably
ready
to
examine
the
white
man
ideas
and
that
he
exercised
a
tidy
discrimination
in
making
his
selections
from
the
samples
placed
on
view
a
shrewder
discrimination
than
was
exhibited
by
his
son
and
successor
liholiho
i
think
liholiho
could
have
qualified
as
a
reformer
perhaps
but
as
a
king
he
was
a
mistake
a
mistake
because
he
tried
to
be
both
king
and
reformer
this
is
mixing
fire
and
gunpowder
together
a
king
has
no
proper
business
with
reforming
his
best
policy
is
to
keep
things
as
they
are
and
if
he
ca
do
that
he
ought
to
try
to
make
them
worse
than
they
are
this
is
not
guesswork
i
have
thought
over
this
matter
a
good
deal
so
that
if
i
should
ever
have
a
chance
to
become
a
king
i
would
know
how
to
conduct
the
business
in
the
best
way
when
liholiho
succeeded
his
father
he
found
himself
possessed
of
an
equipment
of
royal
tools
and
safeguards
which
a
wiser
king
would
have
known
how
to
husband
and
judiciously
employ
and
make
profitable
the
entire
country
was
under
the
one
scepter
and
his
was
that
scepter
there
was
an
established
church
and
he
was
the
head
of
it
there
was
a
standing
army
and
he
was
the
head
of
that
an
army
of
privates
under
command
of
generals
and
a
field
marshal
there
was
a
proud
and
ancient
hereditary
nobility
there
was
still
one
other
asset
this
was
the
tabu
an
agent
endowed
with
a
mysterious
and
stupendous
power
an
agent
not
found
among
the
properties
of
any
european
monarch
a
tool
of
inestimable
value
in
the
business
liholiho
was
headmaster
of
the
tabu
the
tabu
was
the
most
ingenious
and
effective
of
all
the
inventions
that
has
ever
been
devised
for
keeping
a
people
privileges
satisfactorily
restricted
it
required
the
sexes
to
live
in
separate
houses
it
did
not
allow
people
to
eat
in
either
house
they
must
eat
in
another
place
it
did
not
allow
a
man
to
enter
his
house
it
did
not
allow
the
sexes
to
eat
together
the
men
must
eat
first
and
the
women
must
wait
on
them
then
the
women
could
eat
what
was
left
if
anything
was
left
and
wait
on
themselves
i
mean
if
anything
of
a
coarse
or
unpalatable
sort
was
left
the
women
could
have
it
but
not
the
good
things
the
fine
things
the
choice
things
such
as
pork
poultry
bananas
cocoanuts
the
choicer
varieties
of
fish
and
so
on
by
the
tabu
all
these
were
sacred
to
the
men
the
women
spent
their
lives
longing
for
them
and
wondering
what
they
might
taste
like
and
they
died
without
finding
out
these
rules
as
you
see
were
quite
simple
and
clear
it
was
easy
to
remember
them
and
useful
for
the
penalty
for
infringing
any
rule
in
the
whole
list
was
death
those
women
easily
learned
to
put
up
with
shark
and
taro
and
dog
for
a
diet
when
the
other
things
were
so
expensive
it
was
death
for
any
one
to
walk
upon
tabu
ground
or
defile
a
thing
with
his
touch
or
fail
in
due
servility
to
a
chief
or
step
upon
the
king
shadow
the
nobles
and
the
king
and
the
priests
were
always
suspending
little
rags
here
and
there
and
yonder
to
give
notice
to
the
people
that
the
decorated
spot
or
thing
was
tabu
and
death
lurking
near
the
struggle
for
life
was
difficult
and
chancy
in
the
islands
in
those
days
thus
advantageously
was
the
new
king
situated
will
it
be
believed
that
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
destroy
his
established
church
root
and
branch
he
did
indeed
do
that
to
state
the
case
figuratively
he
was
a
prosperous
sailor
who
burnt
his
ship
and
took
to
a
raft
this
church
was
a
horrid
thing
it
heavily
oppressed
the
people
it
kept
them
always
trembling
in
the
gloom
of
mysterious
threatenings
it
slaughtered
them
in
sacrifice
before
its
grotesque
idols
of
wood
and
stone
it
cowed
them
it
terrorized
them
it
made
them
slaves
to
its
priests
and
through
the
priests
to
the
king
it
was
the
best
friend
a
king
could
have
and
the
most
dependable
to
a
professional
reformer
who
should
annihilate
so
frightful
and
so
devastating
a
power
as
this
church
reverence
and
praise
would
be
due
but
to
a
king
who
should
do
it
could
properly
be
due
nothing
but
reproach
reproach
softened
by
sorrow
sorrow
for
his
unfitness
for
his
position
he
destroyed
his
established
church
and
his
kingdom
is
a
republic
today
in
consequence
of
that
act
when
he
destroyed
the
church
and
burned
the
idols
he
did
a
mighty
thing
for
civilization
and
for
his
people
weal
but
it
was
not
business
it
was
unkingly
it
was
inartistic
it
made
trouble
for
his
line
the
american
missionaries
arrived
while
the
burned
idols
were
still
smoking
they
found
the
nation
without
a
religion
and
they
repaired
the
defect
they
offered
their
own
religion
and
it
was
gladly
received
but
it
was
no
support
to
arbitrary
kingship
and
so
the
kingly
power
began
to
weaken
from
that
day
years
later
when
i
was
in
the
islands
kainehameha
was
trying
to
repair
liholiho
blunder
and
not
succeeding
he
had
set
up
an
established
church
and
made
himself
the
head
of
it
but
it
was
only
a
pinchbeck
thing
an
imitation
a
bauble
an
empty
show
it
had
no
power
no
value
for
a
king
it
could
not
harry
or
burn
or
slay
it
in
no
way
resembled
the
admirable
machine
which
liholiho
destroyed
it
was
an
established
church
without
an
establishment
all
the
people
were
dissenters
long
before
that
the
kingship
had
itself
become
but
a
name
a
show
at
an
early
day
the
missionaries
had
turned
it
into
something
very
much
like
a
republic
and
here
lately
the
business
whites
have
turned
it
into
something
exactly
like
it
in
captain
cook
time
the
native
population
of
the
islands
was
estimated
at
in
at
something
short
of
in
at
it
is
per
census
all
intelligent
people
praise
kamehameha
and
liholiho
for
conferring
upon
their
people
the
great
boon
of
civilization
i
would
do
it
myself
but
my
intelligence
is
out
of
repair
now
from
when
i
was
in
the
islands
nearly
a
generation
ago
i
was
acquainted
with
a
young
american
couple
who
had
among
their
belongings
an
attractive
little
son
of
the
age
of
seven
attractive
but
not
practicably
companionable
with
me
because
he
knew
no
english
he
had
played
from
his
birth
with
the
little
kanakas
on
his
father
plantation
and
had
preferred
their
language
and
would
learn
no
other
the
family
removed
to
america
a
month
after
i
arrived
in
the
islands
and
straightway
the
boy
began
to
lose
his
kanaka
and
pick
up
english
by
the
time
he
was
twelve
be
had
a
word
of
kanaka
left
the
language
had
wholly
departed
from
his
tongue
and
from
his
comprehension
nine
years
later
when
he
was
i
came
upon
the
family
in
one
of
the
lake
towns
of
new
york
and
the
mother
told
me
about
an
adventure
which
her
son
had
been
having
by
trade
he
was
now
a
professional
diver
a
passenger
boat
had
been
caught
in
a
storm
on
the
lake
and
had
gone
down
carrying
her
people
with
her
a
few
days
later
the
young
diver
descended
with
his
armor
on
and
entered
the
of
the
boat
and
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
companionway
with
his
hand
on
the
rail
peering
through
the
dim
water
presently
something
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
and
he
turned
and
found
a
dead
man
swaying
and
bobbing
about
him
and
seemingly
inspecting
him
inquiringly
he
was
paralyzed
with
fright
his
entry
had
disturbed
the
water
and
now
he
discerned
a
number
of
dim
corpses
making
for
him
and
wagging
their
heads
and
swaying
their
bodies
like
sleepy
people
trying
to
dance
his
senses
forsook
him
and
in
that
condition
he
was
drawn
to
the
surface
he
was
put
to
bed
at
home
and
was
soon
very
during
some
days
he
had
seasons
of
delirium
which
lasted
several
hours
at
a
time
and
while
they
lasted
he
talked
kanaka
incessantly
and
glibly
and
kanaka
only
he
was
still
very
ill
and
he
talked
to
me
in
that
tongue
but
i
did
not
understand
it
of
course
the
tell
us
that
cases
like
this
are
not
uncommon
then
the
doctors
ought
to
study
the
cases
and
find
out
how
to
multiply
them
many
languages
and
things
get
mislaid
in
a
person
head
and
stay
mislaid
for
lack
of
this
remedy
many
memories
of
my
former
visit
to
the
islands
came
up
in
my
mind
while
we
lay
at
anchor
in
front
of
honolulu
that
night
and
pictures
pictures
pictures
an
enchanting
procession
of
them
i
was
impatient
for
the
morning
to
come
when
it
came
it
brought
disappointment
of
course
cholera
had
broken
out
in
the
town
and
we
were
not
allowed
to
have
any
communication
with
the
shore
thus
suddenly
did
my
dream
of
years
go
to
ruin
messages
came
from
friends
but
the
friends
themselves
i
was
not
to
have
any
sight
of
my
was
ready
but
i
was
not
to
see
that
either
several
of
our
passengers
belonged
in
honolulu
and
these
were
sent
ashore
but
nobody
could
go
ashore
and
return
there
were
people
on
shore
who
were
booked
to
go
with
us
to
australia
but
we
could
not
receive
them
to
do
it
would
cost
us
a
in
sydney
they
could
have
escaped
the
day
before
by
ship
to
san
francisco
but
the
bars
had
been
put
up
now
and
they
might
have
to
wait
weeks
before
any
ship
could
venture
to
give
them
a
passage
any
whither
and
there
were
hardships
for
others
an
elderly
lady
and
her
son
from
massachusetts
had
wandered
westward
further
and
further
from
home
always
intending
to
take
the
return
track
but
always
concluding
to
go
still
a
little
further
and
now
here
they
were
at
anchor
before
honolulu
positively
their
last
indulgence
they
had
made
up
their
minds
to
that
but
where
is
the
use
in
making
up
your
mind
in
this
world
it
is
usually
a
waste
of
time
to
do
it
these
two
would
have
to
stay
with
us
as
far
as
australia
then
they
could
go
on
around
the
world
or
go
back
the
way
they
had
come
the
distance
and
the
accommodations
and
outlay
of
time
would
be
just
the
same
whichever
of
the
two
routes
they
might
elect
to
take
think
of
it
a
projected
excursion
of
five
hundred
miles
gradually
enlarged
without
any
elaborate
degree
of
intention
to
a
possible
thousand
however
they
were
used
to
extensions
by
this
time
and
did
not
mind
this
new
one
much
and
we
had
with
us
a
lawyer
from
victoria
who
had
been
sent
out
by
the
government
on
an
international
matter
and
he
had
brought
his
wife
with
him
and
left
the
children
at
home
with
the
servants
and
now
what
was
to
be
done
go
ashore
amongst
the
cholera
and
take
the
risks
most
certainly
not
they
decided
to
go
on
to
the
fiji
islands
wait
there
a
fortnight
for
the
next
ship
and
then
sail
for
home
they
foresee
that
they
would
see
a
ship
again
for
six
weeks
and
that
no
word
could
come
to
them
from
the
children
and
no
word
go
from
them
to
the
children
in
all
that
time
it
is
easy
to
make
plans
in
this
world
even
a
cat
can
do
it
and
when
one
is
out
in
those
remote
oceans
it
is
noticeable
that
a
cat
plans
and
a
man
are
worth
about
the
same
there
is
much
the
same
shrinkage
in
both
in
the
matter
of
values
there
was
nothing
for
us
to
do
but
sit
about
the
decks
in
the
shade
of
the
awnings
and
look
at
the
distant
shore
we
lay
in
luminous
blue
water
shoreward
the
water
was
and
brilliant
at
the
shore
itself
it
broke
in
a
long
white
ruffle
and
with
no
crash
no
sound
that
we
could
hear
the
town
was
buried
under
a
mat
of
foliage
that
looked
like
a
cushion
of
moss
the
silky
mountains
were
clothed
in
soft
rich
splendors
of
melting
color
and
some
of
the
cliffs
were
veiled
in
slanting
mists
i
recognized
it
all
it
was
just
as
i
had
seen
it
long
before
with
nothing
of
its
beauty
lost
nothing
of
its
charm
wanting
a
change
had
come
but
that
was
political
and
not
visible
from
the
ship
the
monarchy
of
my
day
was
gone
and
a
republic
was
sitting
in
its
seat
it
was
not
a
material
change
the
old
imitation
pomps
the
fuss
and
feathers
have
departed
and
the
royal
trademark
that
is
about
all
that
one
could
miss
i
suppose
that
imitation
monarchy
was
grotesque
enough
in
my
time
if
it
had
held
on
another
thirty
years
it
would
have
been
a
monarchy
without
subjects
of
the
king
race
we
had
a
sunset
of
a
very
fine
sort
the
vast
plain
of
the
sea
was
marked
off
in
bands
of
colors
great
stretches
of
dark
blue
others
of
purple
others
of
polished
bronze
the
billowy
mountains
showed
all
sorts
of
dainty
browns
and
greens
blues
and
purples
and
blacks
and
the
rounded
velvety
backs
of
certain
of
them
made
one
want
to
stroke
them
as
one
would
the
sleek
back
of
a
cat
the
long
sloping
promontory
projecting
into
the
sea
at
the
west
turned
dim
and
leaden
and
spectral
then
became
suffused
with
pink
dissolved
itself
in
a
pink
dream
so
to
speak
it
seemed
so
airy
and
unreal
presently
the
was
flooded
with
fiery
splendors
and
these
were
copied
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
it
made
one
drunk
with
delight
to
look
upon
it
from
talks
with
certain
of
our
passengers
whose
home
was
honolulu
and
from
a
sketch
by
mary
krout
i
was
able
to
perceive
what
the
honolulu
of
is
as
compared
with
the
honolulu
of
my
time
in
my
time
it
was
a
beautiful
little
town
made
up
of
wooden
cottages
deliciously
smothered
in
tropical
vines
and
flowers
and
trees
and
shrubs
and
its
coral
roads
and
streets
were
hard
and
smooth
and
as
white
as
the
houses
the
outside
aspects
of
the
place
suggested
the
presence
of
a
modest
and
comfortable
prosperity
a
general
prosperity
perhaps
one
might
strengthen
the
term
and
say
universal
there
were
no
fine
houses
no
fine
furniture
there
were
no
decorations
tallow
candles
furnished
the
light
for
the
bedrooms
a
lamp
furnished
it
for
the

native

was
nothing
reminiscent
of
foreign
parts
for
nobody
had
been
abroad
trips
were
made
to
san
francisco
but
that
could
not
be
called
going
abroad
comprehensively
speaking
nobody
traveled
but
honolulu
has
grown
wealthy
since
then
and
of
course
wealth
has
introduced
changes
some
of
the
old
simplicities
have
disappeared
here
is
a
modern
house
as
pictured
by
krout
almost
every
house
is
surrounded
by
extensive
lawns
and
gardens
enclosed
by
walls
of
volcanic
stone
or
by
thick
hedges
of
the
brilliant
hibiscus
the
houses
are
most
tastefully
and
comfortably
furnished
the
floors
are
either
of
hard
wood
covered
with
rugs
or
with
fine
indian
matting
while
there
is
a
preference
as
in
most
warm
countries
for
rattan
or
bamboo
furniture
there
are
the
usual
accessories
of
pictures
books
and
curios
from
all
parts
of
the
world
for
these
island
dwellers
are
indefatigable
travelers
nearly
every
house
has
what
is
called
a
lanai
it
is
a
large
apartment
roofed
floored
open
on
three
sides
with
a
door
or
a
draped
archway
opening
into
the
frequently
the
roof
is
formed
by
the
thick
interlacing
boughs
of
the
hou
tree
impervious
to
the
sun
and
even
to
the
rain
except
in
violent
storms
vines
are
trained
about
the
sides
the
stephanotis
or
some
one
of
the
countless
fragrant
and
blossoming
trailers
which
abound
in
the
islands
there
are
also
curtains
of
matting
that
may
be
drawn
to
exclude
the
sun
or
rain
the
floor
is
bare
for
coolness
or
partially
covered
with
rugs
and
the
lanai
is
prettily
furnished
with
comfortable
chairs
sofas
and
tables
loaded
with
flowers
or
wonderful
ferns
in
pots
the
lanai
is
the
favorite
reception
room
and
here
at
any
social
function
the
musical
program
is
given
and
cakes
and
ices
are
served
here
morning
callers
are
received
or
gay
riding
parties
the
ladies
in
pretty
divided
skirts
worn
for
convenience
in
riding
astride
the
universal
mode
adopted
by
europeans
and
americans
as
well
as
by
the
natives
the
comfort
and
luxury
of
such
an
apartment
especially
at
a
seashore
villa
can
hardly
be
imagined
the
soft
breezes
sweep
across
it
heavy
with
the
fragrance
of
jasmine
and
gardenia
and
through
the
swaying
boughs
of
palm
and
mimosa
there
are
glimpses
of
rugged
mountains
their
summits
veiled
in
clouds
of
purple
sea
with
the
white
surf
beating
eternally
against
the
reefs
whiter
still
in
the
yellow
sunlight
or
the
magical
moonlight
of
the
tropics
there
rugs
ices
pictures
lanais
worldly
books
sinful
fetched
from
everywhere
and
the
ladies
riding
astride
these
are
changes
indeed
in
my
time
the
native
women
rode
astride
but
the
white
ones
lacked
the
courage
to
adopt
their
wise
custom
in
my
time
ice
was
seldom
seen
in
honolulu
it
sometimes
came
in
sailing
vessels
from
new
england
as
ballast
and
then
if
there
happened
to
be
a
in
port
and
balls
and
suppers
raging
by
consequence
the
ballast
was
worth
six
hundred
dollars
a
ton
as
is
evidenced
by
reputable
tradition
but
the
has
traveled
all
over
the
world
now
and
brought
ice
within
everybody
reach
in
lapland
and
spitzbergen
no
one
uses
native
ice
in
our
day
except
the
bears
and
the
walruses
the
bicycle
is
not
mentioned
it
was
not
necessary
we
know
that
it
is
there
without
inquiring
it
is
everywhere
but
for
it
people
could
never
have
had
summer
homes
on
the
summit
of
mont
blanc
before
its
day
property
up
there
had
but
a
nominal
value
the
ladies
of
the
hawaiian
capital
learned
too
late
the
right
way
to
occupy
a
horse
too
late
to
get
much
benefit
from
it
the
is
retiring
from
business
everywhere
in
the
world
in
honolulu
a
few
years
from
now
he
will
be
only
a
tradition
we
all
know
about
father
damien
the
french
priest
who
voluntarily
forsook
the
world
and
went
to
the
leper
island
of
molokai
to
labor
among
its
population
of
sorrowful
exiles
who
wait
there
in
misery
for
death
to
cone
and
release
them
from
their
troubles
and
we
know
that
the
thing
which
he
knew
beforehand
would
happen
did
happen
that
he
became
a
leper
himself
and
died
of
that
horrible
disease
there
was
still
another
case
of
it
appears
i
asked
after
billy
ragsdale
interpreter
to
the
parliament
in
my
time
a
he
was
a
brilliant
young
fellow
and
very
popular
as
an
interpreter
he
would
have
been
hard
to
match
anywhere
he
used
to
stand
up
in
the
parliament
and
turn
the
english
speeches
into
hawaiian
and
the
hawaiian
speeches
into
english
with
a
readiness
and
a
volubility
that
were
astonishing
i
asked
after
him
and
was
told
that
his
prosperous
career
was
cut
short
in
a
sudden
and
unexpected
way
just
as
he
was
about
to
marry
a
beautiful
girl
he
discovered
by
some
nearly
invisible
sign
about
his
skin
that
the
poison
of
leprosy
was
in
him
the
secret
was
his
own
and
might
be
kept
concealed
for
years
but
he
would
not
be
treacherous
to
the
girl
that
loved
him
he
would
not
marry
her
to
a
doom
like
his
and
so
he
put
his
affairs
in
order
and
went
around
to
all
his
friends
and
bade
them
and
sailed
in
the
leper
ship
to
molokai
there
he
died
the
loathsome
and
lingering
death
that
all
lepers
die
in
this
place
let
me
insert
a
paragraph
or
two
from
the
paradise
of
the
pacific
rev
gowen
poor
lepers
it
is
easy
for
those
who
have
no
relatives
or
friends
among
them
to
enforce
the
decree
of
segregation
to
the
letter
but
who
can
write
of
the
terrible
the
scenes
which
that
enforcement
has
brought
about
a
man
upon
hawaii
was
suddenly
taken
away
after
a
summary
arrest
leaving
behind
him
a
helpless
wife
about
to
give
birth
to
a
babe
the
devoted
wife
with
great
pain
and
risk
came
the
whole
journey
to
honolulu
and
pleaded
until
the
authorities
were
unable
to
resist
her
entreaty
that
she
might
go
and
live
like
a
leper
with
her
leper
husband
a
woman
in
the
prime
of
life
and
activity
is
condemned
as
an
incipient
leper
suddenly
removed
from
her
home
and
her
husband
returns
to
find
his
two
helpless
babes
moaning
for
their
lost
mother
imagine
it
the
case
of
the
babies
is
hard
but
its
bitterness
is
a
trifle
less
than
a
trifle
less
than
nothing
compared
to
what
the
mother
must
suffer
and
suffer
minute
by
minute
hour
by
hour

by
day

by
month
year
by

without
respite

or
any
abatement

pain

luka
kaaukau
has
been
living
with
her
leper
husband
in
the
settlement
for
twelve
years
the
man
has
scarcely
a
joint
left
his
limbs
are
only
distorted
ulcerated
stumps
for
four
years
his
wife
has
put
every
particle
of
food
into
his
mouth
he
wanted
his
wife
to
abandon
his
wretched
carcass
long
ago
as
she
herself
was
sound
and
well
but
luka
said
that
she
was
content
to
remain
and
wait
on
the
man
she
loved
till
the
spirit
should
be
freed
from
its
burden
i
myself
have
known
hard
cases
enough
of
a
girl
apparently
in
full
health
decorating
the
church
with
me
at
easter
who
before
christmas
is
taken
away
as
a
confirmed
leper
of
a
mother
hiding
her
child
in
the
mountains
for
years
so
that
not
even
her
dearest
friends
knew
that
she
had
a
child
alive
that
he
might
not
be
taken
away
of
a
respectable
white
man
taken
away
from
his
wife
and
family
and
compelled
to
become
a
dweller
in
the
leper
settlement
where
he
is
counted
dead
even
by
the
insurance
companies
and
one
great
pity
of
it
all
is
that
these
poor
sufferers
are
innocent
the
leprosy
does
not
come
of
sins
which
they
committed
but
of
sins
committed
by
their
ancestors
who
escaped
the
curse
of
leprosy
gowan
has
made
record
of
a
certain
very
striking
circumstance
would
you
expect
to
find
in
that
awful
leper
settlement
a
custom
worthy
to
be
transplanted
to
your
own
country
they
have
one
such
and
it
is
inexpressibly
touching
and
beautiful
when
death
sets
open
the
of
life
there
the
band
salutes
the
freed
soul
with
a
burst
of
glad

flocks
of
flying
shapely
graceful
and
intensely
white
with
the
sun
on
them
they
look
like
a
flight
of
silver
they
are
able
to
fly
a
hundred
yards
in

north
latitude
at
breakfast
approaching
the
equator
on
a
long
slant
those
of
us
who
have
never
seen
the
equator
are
a
good
deal
excited
i
think
i
would
rather
see
it
than
any
other
thing
in
the
world
we
entered
the
doldrums
last
night
variable
winds
bursts
of
rain
intervals
of
calm
with
chopping
seas
and
a
wobbly
and
drunken
motion
to
the
ship
a
condition
of
things
findable
in
other
regions
sometimes
but
present
in
the
doldrums
always
the
belt
called
the
doldrums
is
degrees
wide
and
the
thread
called
the
equator
lies
along
the
middle
of
it
total
eclipse
of
the
moon
last
night
at
it
began
to
go
off
at
total
or
about
that
it
was
like
a
rich
rosy
cloud
with
a
tumbled
surface
framed
in
the
circle
and
projecting
from
it
a
bulge
of
so
to
speak
at
the
moon
was
like
a
gilded
acorn
in
its
cup
closing
in
on
the
equator
this
noon
a
sailor
explained
to
a
young
girl
that
the
ship
speed
is
poor
because
we
are
climbing
up
the
bulge
toward
the
center
of
the
globe
but
that
when
we
should
once
get
over
at
the
equator
and
start
we
should
fly
when
she
asked
him
the
other
day
what
the
was
he
said
it
was
the
front
yard
the
open
area
in
the
front
end
of
the
ship
that
man
has
a
good
deal
of
learning
stored
up
and
the
girl
is
likely
to
get
it
all
afternoon
crossed
the
equator
in
the
distance
it
looked
like
a
blue
ribbon
stretched
across
the
ocean
several
passengers
kodak
it
we
had
no
fool
ceremonies
no
fantastics
no
horse
play
all
that
sort
of
thing
has
gone
out
in
old
times
a
sailor
dressed
as
neptune
used
to
come
in
over
the
bows
with
his
suite
and
lather
up
and
shave
everybody
who
was
crossing
the
equator
for
the
first
time
and
then
cleanse
these
unfortunates
by
swinging
them
from
the
and
ducking
them
three
times
in
the
sea
this
was
considered
funny
nobody
knows
why
no
that
is
not
true
we
do
know
why
such
a
thing
could
never
be
funny
on
land
no
part
of
the
grotesque
performances
gotten
up
on
shipboard
to
celebrate
the
passage
of
the
line
would
ever
be
funny
on
shore
they
would
seem
dreary
and
less
to
shore
people
but
the
shore
people
would
change
their
minds
about
it
at
sea
on
a
long
voyage
on
such
a
voyage
with
its
eternal
monotonies
people
intellects
deteriorate
the
owners
of
the
intellects
soon
reach
a
point
where
they
almost
seem
to
prefer
childish
things
to
things
of
a
maturer
degree
one
is
often
surprised
at
the
juvenilities
which
grown
people
indulge
in
at
sea
and
the
interest
they
take
in
them
and
the
consuming
enjoyment
they
get
out
of
them
this
is
on
long
voyages
only
the
mind
gradually
becomes
inert
dull
blunted
it
loses
its
accustomed
interest
in
intellectual
things
nothing
but
can
rouse
it
nothing
but
wild
and
foolish
grotesqueries
can
entertain
it
on
short
voyages
it
makes
no
such
exposure
of
itself
it
has
time
to
slump
down
to
this
sorrowful
level
the
passenger
gets
his
chief
physical
exercise
out
of
it
is
a
good
game
we
play
it
in
this
ship
a
quartermaster
chalks
off
a
diagram
like
the
deck
the
player
uses
a
cue
that
is
like
a
with
a
of
wood
fastened
to
the
end
of
it
with
this
he
shoves
wooden
disks
the
size
of
a
saucer
he
gives
the
disk
a
vigorous
shove
and
sends
it
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
along
the
deck
and
lands
it
in
one
of
the
squares
if
he
can
if
it
stays
there
till
the
inning
is
played
out
it
will
count
as
many
points
in
the
game
as
the
figure
in
the
square
it
has
stopped
in
represents
the
adversary
plays
to
knock
that
disk
out
and
leave
his
own
in
its
place
particularly
if
it
rests
upon
the
or
or
some
other
of
the
high
numbers
but
if
it
rests
in
the
he
backs
it
up
lands
his
disk
behind
it
a
foot
or
two
to
make
it
difficult
for
its
owner
to
knock
it
out
of
that
damaging
place
and
improve
his
record
when
the
inning
is
played
out
it
may
be
found
that
each
adversary
has
placed
his
four
disks
where
they
count
it
may
be
found
that
some
of
them
are
touching
chalk
lines
and
not
counting
and
very
often
it
will
be
found
that
there
has
been
a
general
wreckage
and
that
not
a
disk
has
been
left
within
the
diagram
anyway
the
result
is
recorded
whatever
it
is
and
the
game
goes
on
the
game
is
points
and
it
takes
from
twenty
minutes
to
forty
to
play
it
according
to
luck
and
the
condition
of
the
sea
it
is
an
exciting
game
and
the
crowd
of
spectators
furnish
abundance
of
applause
for
fortunate
shots
and
plenty
of
laughter
for
the
other
kind
it
is
a
game
of
skill
but
at
the
same
time
the
uneasy
motion
of
the
ship
is
constantly
interfering
with
skill
this
makes
it
a
chancy
game
and
the
element
of
luck
comes
largely
in
we
had
a
couple
of
grand
tournaments
to
determine
who
should
be
champion
of
the
pacific
they
included
among
the
participants
nearly
all
the
passengers
of
both
sexes
and
the
officers
of
the
ship
and
they
afforded
many
days
of
stupendous
interest
and
excitement
and
murderous
exercise
for
is
a
physically
violent
game
the
figures
in
the
following
record
of
some
of
the
closing
games
in
the
first
tournament
will
show
better
than
any
description
how
very
chancy
the
game
is
the
losers
here
represented
had
all
been
winners
in
the
previous
games
of
the
series
some
of
them
by
fine
majorities
mortimer
the
surgeon
miss
clemens
miss
clemens
miss
coomber
and
so
on
until
but
three
couples
of
winners
were
left
then
i
beat
my
man
young
smith
beat
his
man
and
thomas
beat
his
this
reduced
the
combatants
to
three
smith
and
i
took
the
deck
and
i
led
off
at
the
close
of
the
first
inning
i
was
worse
than
nothing
and
smith
had
scored
the
luck
continued
against
me
when
i
was
smith
was
within
of
out
the
luck
changed
then
he
picked
up
a
or
so
and
could
recover
i
beat
him
the
next
game
would
end
tournament
no
thomas
and
i
were
the
contestants
he
won
the
lead
and
went
to
the
bat
so
to
speak
and
there
he
stood
with
the
crotch
of
his
cue
resting
against
his
disk
while
the
ship
rose
slowly
up
sank
slowly
down
rose
again
sank
again
she
never
seemed
to
rise
to
suit
him
exactly
she
started
up
once
more
and
when
she
was
nearly
ready
for
the
turn
he
let
drive
and
landed
his
disk
just
within
the
end
of
the
applause
the
umpire
proclaimed
a
good
and
the
set
it
down
i
played
my
disk
grazed
the
edge
of
thomas
disk
and
went
out
of
the
diagram
no
applause
thomas
played
again
and
landed
his
second
disk
alongside
of
the
first
and
almost
touching
its
side
good
great
applause
i
played
and
missed
both
of
them
no
applause
thomas
delivered
his
third
shot
and
landed
his
disk
just
at
the
right
of
the
other
two
good
immense
applause
there
they
lay
side
by
side
the
three
in
a
row
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
anybody
could
miss
them
still
i
did
it
immense
silence
thomas
played
his
last
disk
it
seems
incredible
but
he
actually
landed
that
disk
alongside
of
the
others
and
just
to
the
right
of
straight
solid
row
of
disks
tumultuous
and
applause
then
i
played
my
last
disk
again
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
anybody
could
miss
that
row
a
row
which
would
have
been
inches
long
if
the
disks
had
been
clamped
together
whereas
with
the
spaces
separating
them
they
made
a
longer
row
than
that
but
i
did
it
it
may
be
that
i
was
getting
nervous
i
think
it
unlikely
that
that
innings
has
ever
had
its
parallel
in
the
history
of
to
place
the
four
disks
side
by
side
in
the
was
an
extraordinary
feat
indeed
it
was
a
kind
of
miracle
to
miss
them
was
another
miracle
it
will
take
a
century
to
produce
another
man
who
can
place
the
four
disks
in
the
and
longer
than
that
to
find
a
man
who
ca
knock
them
out
i
was
ashamed
of
my
performance
at
the
time
but
now
that
i
reflect
upon
it
i
see
that
it
was
rather
fine
and
difficult
thomas
kept
his
luck
and
won
the
game
and
later
the
championship
in
a
minor
tournament
i
won
the
prize
which
was
a
waterbury
watch
i
put
it
in
my
trunk
in
pretoria
south
africa
nine
months
afterward
my
proper
watch
broke
down
and
i
took
the
waterbury
out
wound
it
set
it
by
the
great
clock
on
the
parliament
house
then
went
back
to
my
room
and
went
to
bed
tired
from
a
long
railway
journey
the
parliamentary
clock
had
a
peculiarity
which
i
was
not
aware
of
at
the
time
a
peculiarity
which
exists
in
no
other
clock
and
would
not
exist
in
that
one
if
it
had
been
made
by
a
sane
person
on
the
it
strikes
the
succeeding
hour
then
strikes
the
hour
again
at
the
proper
time
i
lay
reading
and
smoking
awhile
then
when
i
could
hold
my
eyes
open
no
longer
and
was
about
to
put
out
the
light
the
great
clock
began
to
boom
and
i
counted
ten
i
reached
for
the
waterbury
to
see
how
it
was
getting
along
it
was
marking
it
seemed
rather
poor
speed
for
a
watch
but
i
supposed
that
the
climate
was
affecting
it
i
shoved
it
half
an
hour
ahead
and
took
to
my
book
and
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
at
the
great
clock
struck
ten
again
i
looked
the
waterbury
was
marking
this
was
too
much
speed
for
the
money
and
it
troubled
me
i
pushed
the
hands
back
a
half
hour
and
waited
once
more
i
had
to
for
i
was
vexed
and
restless
now
and
my
sleepiness
was
gone
by
and
by
the
great
clock
struck
the
waterbury
was
marking
i
pushed
it
ahead
half
an
hour
with
some
show
of
temper
by
and
by
the
great
clock
struck
again
the
waterbury
showed
up
now
and
i
beat
her
brains
out
against
the
bedstead
i
was
sorry
next
day
when
i
found
out
to
return
to
the
ship
the
average
human
being
is
a
perverse
creature
and
when
he
is
that
he
is
a
practical
joker
the
result
to
the
other
person
concerned
is
about
the
same
that
is
he
is
made
to
suffer
the
washing
down
of
the
decks
begins
at
a
very
early
hour
in
all
ships
in
but
few
ships
are
any
measures
taken
to
protect
the
passengers
either
by
waking
or
warning
them
or
by
sending
a
steward
to
close
their
ports
and
so
the
deckwashers
have
their
opportunity
and
they
use
it
they
send
a
bucket
of
water
slashing
along
the
side
of
the
ship
and
into
the
ports
drenching
the
passenger
clothes
and
often
the
passenger
himself
this
good
old
custom
prevailed
in
this
ship
and
under
unusually
favorable
circumstances
for
in
the
blazing
tropical
regions
a
removable
zinc
thing
like
a
sugarshovel
projects
from
the
port
to
catch
the
wind
and
bring
it
in
this
thing
catches
the
and
brings
it
in
too
and
in
flooding
abundance
l
an
invalid
had
to
sleep
on
the
locker
sofa
under
her
port
and
every
time
she
and
thus
failed
to
take
care
of
herself
the
drowned
her
out
and
the
painters
what
a
good
time
they
had
this
ship
would
be
going
into
dock
for
a
month
in
sydney
for
repairs
but
no
matter
painting
was
going
on
all
the
time
somewhere
or
other
the
ladies
dresses
were
constantly
getting
ruined
nevertheless
protests
and
supplications
went
for
nothing
sometimes
a
lady
taking
an
afternoon
nap
on
deck
near
a
ventilator
or
some
other
thing
that
did
need
painting
would
wake
up
by
and
by
and
find
that
the
humorous
painter
had
been
noiselessly
daubing
that
thing
and
had
splattered
her
white
gown
all
over
with
little
greasy
yellow
spots
the
blame
for
this
untimely
painting
did
not
lie
with
the
officers
but
with
custom
as
far
back
as
noah
time
it
became
law
that
ships
must
be
constantly
painted
and
fussed
at
when
at
sea
custom
grew
out
of
the
law
and
at
sea
custom
knows
no
death
this
custom
will
continue
until
the
sea
goes
dry
sept
sunday
we
are
moving
so
nearly
south
that
we
cross
only
about
two
meridians
of
longitude
a
day
this
morning
we
were
in
longitude
west
from
greenwich
and
degrees
west
from
san
francisco
we
shall
be
close
to
the
center
of
the
globe
the
degree
of
west
longitude
and
degree
of
east
longitude
and
then
we
must
drop
out
a
a
day
out
of
our
lives
a
day
never
to
be
found
again
we
shall
all
die
one
day
earlier
than
from
the
beginning
of
time
we
were
foreordained
to
die
we
shall
be
a
day
behindhand
all
through
eternity
we
shall
always
be
saying
to
the
other
angels
fine
day
today
and
they
will
be
always
retorting
but
it
is
it
tomorrow
we
shall
be
in
a
state
of
confusion
all
the
time
and
shall
never
know
what
true
happiness
is
next
day
sure
enough
it
has
happened
yesterday
it
was
september
sunday
per
the
at
the
head
of
the
companionway
it
is
september
tuesday
there
is
something
uncanny
about
it
and
uncomfortable
in
fact
nearly
unthinkable
and
wholly
unrealizable
when
one
comes
to
consider
it
while
we
were
crossing
the
meridian
it
was
sunday
in
the
stern
of
the
ship
where
my
family
were
and
tuesday
in
the
bow
where
i
was
they
were
there
eating
the
half
of
a
fresh
apple
on
the
and
i
was
at
the
same
time
eating
the
other
half
of
it
on
the
and
i
could
notice
how
stale
it
was
already
the
family
were
the
same
age
that
they
were
when
i
had
left
them
five
minutes
before
but
i
was
a
day
older
now
than
i
was
then
the
day
they
were
living
in
stretched
behind
them
half
way
round
the
globe
across
the
pacific
ocean
and
america
and
europe
the
day
i
was
living
in
stretched
in
front
of
me
around
the
other
half
to
meet
it
they
were
stupendous
days
for
bulk
and
stretch
apparently
much
larger
days
than
we
had
ever
been
in
before
all
previous
days
had
been
but
little
things
by
comparison
the
difference
in
temperature
between
the
two
days
was
very
marked
their
day
being
hotter
than
mine
because
it
was
closer
to
the
equator
along
about
the
moment
that
we
were
crossing
the
great
meridian
a
child
was
born
in
the
steerage
and
now
there
is
no
way
to
tell
which
day
it
was
born
on
the
nurse
thinks
it
was
sunday
the
surgeon
thinks
it
was
tuesday
the
child
will
never
know
its
own
birthday
it
will
always
be
choosing
first
one
and
then
the
other
and
will
never
be
able
to
make
up
its
mind
permanently
this
will
breed
vacillation
and
uncertainty
in
its
opinions
about
religion
and
politics
and
business
and
sweethearts
and
everything
and
will
undermine
its
principles
and
rot
them
away
and
make
the
poor
thing
characterless
and
its
success
in
life
impossible
every
one
in
the
ship
says
so
and
this
is
not
all
in
fact
not
the
worst
for
there
is
an
enormously
rich
brewer
in
the
ship
who
said
as
much
as
ten
days
ago
that
if
the
child
was
born
on
his
birthday
he
would
give
it
ten
thousand
dollars
to
start
its
little
life
with
his
birthday
was
monday
the
of
september
if
the
ships
all
moved
in
the
one
direction
westward
i
mean
the
world
would
suffer
a
prodigious
loss
in
the
matter
of
valuable
time
through
the
dumping
overboard
on
the
great
meridian
of
such
multitudes
of
days
by
ships
crews
and
passengers
but
fortunately
the
ships
do
not
all
sail
west
half
of
them
sail
east
so
there
is
no
real
loss
these
latter
pick
up
all
the
discarded
days
and
add
them
to
the
world
stock
again
and
about
as
good
as
new
too
for
of
course
the
salt
water
preserves
them
chapter
noise
proves
nothing
often
a
hen
who
has
merely
laid
an
egg
cackles

wednesday
in
this
world
we
often
make
mistakes
of
judgment
we
do
not
as
a
rule
get
out
of
them
sound
and
whole
but
sometimes
we
do
at
dinner
yesterday
a
mixture
of
scotch
english
american
canadian
and
australasian
folk
a
discussion
broke
out
about
the
pronunciation
of
certain
scottish
words
this
was
private
ground
and
the
nationalities
with
one
exception
discreetly
kept
still
but
i
am
not
discreet
and
i
took
a
hand
i
did
know
anything
about
the
subject
but
i
took
a
hand
just
to
have
something
to
do
at
that
moment
the
word
in
dispute
was
the
word
three
one
scotchman
was
claiming
that
the
peasantry
of
scotland
pronounced
it
three
his
adversaries
claimed
that
they
did
that
they
pronounced
it
the
solitary
scot
was
having
a
sultry
time
of
it
so
i
thought
i
would
enrich
him
with
my
help
in
my
position
i
was
necessarily
quite
impartial
and
was
equally
as
well
and
as
ill
equipped
to
fight
on
the
one
side
as
on
the
other
so
i
spoke
up
and
said
the
peasantry
pronounced
the
word
three
not
thraw
it
was
an
error
of
judgment
there
was
a
moment
of
astonished
and
ominous
silence
then
weather
ensued
the
storm
rose
and
spread
in
a
surprising
way
and
i
was
snowed
under
in
a
very
few
minutes
it
was
a
bad
defeat
for
me
a
kind
of
waterloo
it
promised
to
remain
so
and
i
wished
i
had
had
better
sense
than
to
enter
upon
such
a
forlorn
enterprise
but
just
then
i
had
a
saving
thought
at
least
a
thought
that
offered
a
chance
while
the
storm
was
still
raging
i
made
up
a
scotch
couplet
and
then
spoke
up
and
said
very
well
do
say
any
more
i
confess
defeat
i
thought
i
knew
but
i
see
my
mistake
i
was
deceived
by
one
of
your
scotch
poets
a
scotch
poet
o
come
name
him
robert
burns
it
is
wonderful
the
power
of
that
name
these
men
looked
doubtful
but
paralyzed
all
the
same
they
were
quite
silent
for
a
moment
then
one
of
them
said
with
the
reverence
in
his
voice
which
is
always
present
in
a
scotchman
tone
when
he
utters
the
name
does
robbie
burns
say
what
does
he
say
this
is
what
he
says
were
nae
bairns
but
only
three
ane
at
the
breast
twa
at
the
knee
it
ended
the
discussion
there
was
no
man
there
profane
enough
disloyal
enough
to
say
any
word
against
a
thing
which
robert
burns
had
settled
i
shall
always
honor
that
great
name
for
the
salvation
it
brought
me
in
this
time
of
my
sore
need
it
is
my
belief
that
nearly
any
invented
quotation
played
with
confidence
stands
a
good
chance
to
deceive
there
are
people
who
think
that
honesty
is
always
the
best
policy
this
is
a
superstition
there
are
times
when
the
appearance
of
it
is
worth
six
of
it
we
are
moving
steadily
further
and
further
down
under
the
projecting
paunch
of
the
globe
yesterday
evening
we
saw
the
big
dipper
and
the
north
star
sink
below
the
horizon
and
disappear
from
our
world
no
not
we
but
they
they
saw
it
somebody
saw
it
and
told
me
about
it
but
it
is
no
matter
i
was
not
caring
for
those
things
i
am
tired
of
them
any
way
i
think
they
are
well
enough
but
one
want
them
always
hanging
around
my
interest
was
all
in
the
southern
cross
i
had
never
seen
that
i
had
heard
about
it
all
my
life
and
it
was
but
natural
that
i
should
be
burning
to
see
it
no
other
constellation
makes
so
much
talk
i
had
nothing
against
the
big
dipper
and
naturally
could
have
anything
against
it
since
it
is
a
citizen
of
our
own
sky
and
the
property
of
the
united
states
but
i
did
want
it
to
move
out
of
the
way
and
give
this
foreigner
a
chance
judging
by
the
size
of
the
talk
which
the
southern
cross
had
made
i
supposed
it
would
need
a
sky
all
to
itself
but
that
was
a
mistake
we
saw
the
cross
and
it
is
not
large
not
large
and
not
strikingly
bright
but
it
was
low
down
toward
the
horizon
and
it
may
improve
when
it
gets
up
higher
in
the
sky
it
is
ingeniously
named
for
it
looks
just
as
a
cross
would
look
if
it
looked
like
something
else
but
that
description
does
not
describe
it
is
too
vague
too
general
too
indefinite
it
does
after
a
fashion
suggest
a
cross
across
that
is
out
of
repair
or
out
of
drawing
not
correctly
shaped
it
is
long
with
a
short
and
the
is
canted
out
of
the
straight
line
it
consists
of
four
large
stars
and
one
little
one
the
little
one
is
out
of
line
and
further
damages
the
shape
it
should
have
been
placed
at
the
intersection
of
the
stem
and
the
if
you
do
not
draw
an
imaginary
line
from
star
to
star
it
does
not
suggest
a
cross
nor
anything
in
particular
one
must
ignore
the
little
star
and
leave
it
out
of
the
combination
it
confuses
everything
if
you
leave
it
out
then
you
can
make
out
of
the
four
stars
a
sort
of
cross
out
of
true
or
a
sort
of
kite
out
of
true
or
a
sort
of
of
true
constellations
have
always
been
troublesome
things
to
name
if
you
give
one
of
them
a
fanciful
name
it
will
always
refuse
to
live
up
to
it
it
will
always
persist
in
not
resembling
the
thing
it
has
been
named
for
ultimately
to
satisfy
the
public
the
fanciful
name
has
to
be
discarded
for
a
one
a
manifestly
descriptive
one
the
great
bear
remained
the
great
bear
and
unrecognizable
as
such
for
thousands
of
years
and
people
complained
about
it
all
the
time
and
quite
properly
but
as
soon
as
it
became
the
property
of
the
united
states
congress
changed
it
to
the
big
dipper
and
now
every
body
is
satisfied
and
there
is
no
more
talk
about
riots
i
would
not
change
the
southern
cross
to
the
southern
coffin
i
would
change
it
to
the
southern
kite
for
up
there
in
the
general
emptiness
is
the
proper
home
of
a
kite
but
not
for
coffins
and
crosses
and
dippers
in
a
little
while
now
i
can
not
tell
exactly
how
long
it
will
be
the
globe
will
belong
to
the
race
and
of
course
the
skies
also
then
the
constellations
will
be
and
polished
up
and
the
most
of
them
victoria
i
reckon
but
this
one
will
sail
thereafter
as
the
southern
kite
or
go
out
of
business
several
towns
and
things
here
and
there
have
been
named
for
her
majesty
already
in
these
past
few
days
we
are
plowing
through
a
mighty
milky
way
of
islands
they
are
so
thick
on
the
map
that
one
would
hardly
expect
to
find
room
between
them
for
a
canoe
yet
we
seldom
glimpse
one
once
we
saw
the
dim
bulk
of
a
couple
of
them
far
away
spectral
and
dreamy
things
members
of
the
and
fortuna
on
the
larger
one
are
two
rival
native
kings
and
they
have
a
time
together
they
are
catholics
so
are
their
people
the
missionaries
there
are
french
priests
from
the
multitudinous
islands
in
these
regions
the
recruits
for
the
queensland
plantations
were
formerly
drawn
are
still
drawn
from
them
i
believe
vessels
fitted
up
like
slavers
came
here
and
carried
off
the
natives
to
serve
as
laborers
in
the
great
australian
province
in
the
beginning
it
was
plain
simple
as
per
testimony
of
the
missionaries
this
has
been
denied
but
not
disproven
afterward
it
was
forbidden
by
law
to
recruit
a
native
without
his
consent
and
governmental
agents
were
sent
in
all
recruiting
vessels
to
see
that
the
law
was
obeyed
which
they
did
according
to
the
recruiting
people
and
which
they
sometimes
did
according
to
the
missionaries
a
man
could
be
lawfully
recruited
for
a
term
of
service
he
could
volunteer
for
another
term
if
he
so
chose
when
his
time
was
up
he
could
return
to
his
island
and
would
also
have
the
means
to
do
it
for
the
government
required
the
employer
to
put
money
in
its
hands
for
this
purpose
before
the
recruit
was
delivered
to
him
captain
wawn
was
a
recruiting
during
many
years
from
his
pleasant
book
one
gets
the
idea
that
the
recruiting
business
was
quite
popular
with
the
islanders
as
a
rule
and
yet
that
did
not
make
the
business
wholly
dull
and
uninteresting
for
one
finds
rather
frequent
little
breaks
in
the
monotony
of
it
like
this
for
instance
the
afternoon
of
our
arrival
at
leper
island
the
schooner
was
lying
almost
becalmed
under
the
lee
of
the
lofty
central
portion
of
the
island
about
of
a
mile
from
the
shore
the
boats
were
in
sight
at
some
distance
the
had
run
into
a
small
nook
on
the
rocky
coast
under
a
high
bank
above
which
stood
a
solitary
hut
backed
by
dense
forest
the
government
agent
and
mate
in
the
second
boat
lay
about
yards
to
the
westward
suddenly
we
heard
the
sound
of
firing
followed
by
yells
from
the
natives
on
shore
and
then
we
saw
the
push
out
with
a
seemingly
diminished
crew
the
mate
boat
pulled
quickly
up
took
her
in
tow
and
presently
brought
her
alongside
all
her
own
crew
being
more
or
less
hurt
it
seems
the
natives
had
called
them
into
the
place
on
pretence
of
friendship
a
crowd
gathered
about
the
stern
of
the
boat
and
several
fellows
even
got
into
her
all
of
a
sudden
our
men
were
attacked
with
clubs
and
tomahawks
the
recruiter
escaped
the
first
blows
aimed
at
him
making
play
with
his
fists
until
he
had
an
opportunity
to
draw
his
revolver
sayers
a
mare
man
received
a
tomahawk
blow
on
the
head
which
laid
the
scalp
open
but
did
not
penetrate
his
skull
fortunately
towns
another
mare
boatman
had
both
his
thumbs
cut
in
warding
off
blows
one
of
them
being
so
nearly
severed
from
the
hand
that
the
doctors
had
to
finish
the
operation
lihu
a
lifu
boy
the
recruiter
special
attendant
was
cut
and
pricked
in
various
places
but
nowhere
seriously
jack
an
unlucky
tanna
recruit
who
had
been
engaged
to
act
as
boatman
received
an
arrow
through
his
forearm
the
head
of
which
apiece
of
bone
seven
or
eight
inches
long
was
still
in
the
limb
protruding
from
both
sides
when
the
boats
returned
the
recruiter
himself
would
have
got
off
had
not
an
arrow
pinned
one
of
his
fingers
to
the
loom
of
the
just
as
they
were
getting
off
the
fight
had
been
short
but
sharp
the
enemy
lost
two
men
both
shot
dead
the
truth
is
captain
wawn
furnishes
such
a
crowd
of
instances
of
fatal
encounters
between
natives
and
french
and
english
for
the
french
are
in
the
business
for
the
plantations
of
new
caledonia
that
one
is
almost
persuaded
that
recruiting
is
not
thoroughly
popular
among
the
islanders
else
why
this
bristling
string
of
attacks
and
bloodcurdling
slaughter
the
captain
lays
it
all
to
exeter
hall
influence
but
for
the
meddling
philanthropists
the
native
fathers
and
mothers
would
be
fond
of
seeing
their
children
carted
into
exile
and
now
and
then
the
grave
instead
of
weeping
about
it
and
trying
to
kill

chapter
vi
he
was
as
shy
as
a
newspaper
is
when
referring
to
its
own
merits
wilson
new
calendar
captain
wawn
is
on
one
point
he
does
not
approve
of
missionaries
they
obstruct
his
business
they
make
recruiting
as
he
calls
it
as
they
call
it
in
their
frank
way
a
trouble
when
it
ought
to
be
just
a
picnic
and
a
pleasure
excursion
the
missionaries
have
their
opinion
about
the
manner
in
which
the
labor
traffic
is
conducted
and
about
the
recruiter
evasions
of
the
law
of
the
traffic
and
about
the
traffic
itself
and
it
is
distinctly
uncomplimentary
to
the
traffic
and
to
everything
connected
with
it
including
the
law
for
its
regulation
captain
wawn
book
is
of
very
recent
date
i
have
by
me
a
pamphlet
of
still
later
date
hot
from
the
press
in
fact
by
rev
wm
gray
a
missionary
and
the
book
and
the
pamphlet
taken
together
make
exceedingly
interesting
reading
to
my
mind
interesting
and
easy
to
understand
except
in
one
detail
which
i
will
mention
presently
it
is
easy
to
understand
why
the
queensland
sugar
planter
should
want
the
kanaka
recruit
he
is
cheap
very
cheap
in
fact
these
are
the
figures
paid
by
the
planter
to
the
recruiter
for
getting
the
kanaka
or
catching
him
as
the
missionary
phrase
goes
to
the
queensland
government
for
superintending
the
importation
deposited
with
the
government
for
the
kanaka
passage
home
when
his
three
years
are
up
in
case
he
shall
live
that
long
about
to
the
kanaka
himself
for
three
years
wages
and
clothing
total
payment
for
the
use
of
a
man
three
years
or
including
diet
altogether
a
hundred
dollars
a
year
one
can
understand
why
the
recruiter
is
fond
of
the
business
the
recruit
costs
him
a
few
cheap
presents
given
to
the
recruit
relatives
not
himself
and
the
recruit
is
worth
to
the
recruiter
when
delivered
in
queensland
all
this
is
clear
enough
but
the
thing
that
is
not
clear
is
what
there
is
about
it
all
to
persuade
the
recruit
he
is
young
and
brisk
life
at
home
in
his
beautiful
island
is
one
lazy
long
holiday
to
him
or
if
he
wants
to
work
he
can
turn
out
a
couple
of
bags
of
copra
per
week
and
sell
it
for
four
or
five
shillings
a
bag
in
queensland
he
must
get
up
at
dawn
and
work
from
eight
to
twelve
hours
a
day
in
the
canefields
in
a
much
hotter
climate
than
he
is
used
to
and
get
less
than
four
shillings
a
week
for
it
i
can
not
understand
his
willingness
to
go
to
queensland
it
is
a
deep
puzzle
to
me
here
is
the
explanation
from
the
planter
point
of
view
at
least
i
gather
from
the
missionary
pamphlet
that
it
is
the
planter
when
he
comes
from
his
home
he
is
a
savage
pure
and
simple
he
feels
no
shame
at
his
nakedness
and
want
of
adornment
when
he
returns
home
he
does
so
well
dressed
sporting
a
waterbury
watch
collars
cuffs
boots
and
jewelry
he
takes
with
him
one
or
more
boxes
box
is
english
for
trunk
well
filled
with
clothing
a
musical
instrument
or
two
and
perfumery
and
other
articles
of
luxury
he
has
learned
to
appreciate
for
just
one
moment
we
have
a
seeming
flash
of
comprehension
of
the
kanaka
reason
for
exiling
himself
he
goes
away
to
acquire
civilization
yes
he
was
naked
and
not
ashamed
now
he
is
clothed
and
knows
how
to
be
ashamed
he
was
unenlightened
now
he
has
a
waterbury
watch
he
was
unrefined
now
he
has
jewelry
and
something
to
make
him
smell
good
he
was
a
nobody
a
provincial
now
he
has
been
to
far
countries
and
can
show
off
it
all
looks
plausible
for
a
moment
then
the
missionary
takes
hold
of
this
explanation
and
pulls
it
to
pieces
and
dances
on
it
and
damages
it
beyond
recognition
admitting
that
the
foregoing
description
is
the
average
one
the
average
sequel
is
this
the
cuffs
and
collars
if
used
at
all
are
carried
off
by
youngsters
who
fasten
them
round
the
leg
just
below
the
knee
as
ornaments
the
waterbury
broken
and
dirty
finds
its
way
to
the
trader
who
gives
a
trifle
for
it
or
the
inside
is
taken
out
the
wheels
strung
on
a
thread
and
hung
round
the
neck
knives
axes
calico
and
handkerchiefs
are
divided
among
friends
and
there
is
hardly
one
of
these
apiece
the
boxes
the
keys
often
lost
on
the
road
home
can
be
bought
for
they
are
to
be
seen
rotting
outside
in
almost
any
shore
village
on
tanna
i
speak
of
what
i
have
seen
a
returned
kanaka
has
been
furiously
angry
with
me
because
i
would
not
buy
his
trousers
which
he
declared
were
just
my
fit
he
sold
them
afterwards
to
one
of
my
aniwan
teachers
for
worth
of
tobacco
a
pair
of
trousers
that
probably
cost
him
or
in
queensland
a
coat
or
shirt
is
handy
for
cold
weather
the
white
handkerchiefs
the
perfumery
the
umbrella
and
perhaps
the
hat
are
kept
the
boots
have
to
take
their
chance
if
they
do
not
happen
to
fit
the
copra
trader
on
the
hair
streaks
of
paint
on
the
face
a
dirty
white
handkerchief
round
the
neck
strips
of
turtle
shell
in
the
ears
a
belt
a
sheath
and
knife
and
an
umbrella
constitute
the
rig
of
returned
kanaka
at
home
the
day
after
landing
a
hat
an
umbrella
a
belt
a
neckerchief
otherwise
stark
naked
all
in
a
day
the
civilization
has
melted
away
to
this
and
even
these
perishable
things
must
presently
go
indeed
there
is
but
a
single
detail
of
his
civilization
that
can
be
depended
on
to
stay
by
him
according
to
the
missionary
he
has
learned
to
swear
this
is
art
and
art
is
long
as
the
poet
says
in
all
countries
the
laws
throw
light
upon
the
past
the
queensland
law
for
the
regulation
of
the
labor
traffic
is
a
confession
it
is
a
confession
that
the
evils
charged
by
the
missionaries
upon
the
traffic
had
existed
in
the
past
and
that
they
still
existed
when
the
law
was
made
the
missionaries
make
a
further
charge
that
the
law
is
evaded
by
the
recruiters
and
that
the
government
agent
sometimes
helps
them
to
do
it
regulation
reveals
two
things
that
sometimes
a
young
fool
of
a
recruit
gets
his
senses
back
after
being
persuaded
to
sign
away
his
liberty
for
three
years
and
dearly
wants
to
get
out
of
the
engagement
and
stay
at
home
with
his
own
people
and
that
threats
intimidation
and
force
are
used
to
keep
him
on
board
the
and
to
hold
him
to
his
contract
regulation
forbids
these
coercions
the
law
requires
that
he
shall
be
allowed
to
go
free
and
another
clause
of
it
requires
the
recruiter
to
set
him
ashore
per
boat
because
of
the
prevalence
of
sharks
testimony
from
rev
gray
there
are
for
taking
the
penitent
kanaka
my
first
experience
of
the
traffic
was
a
case
of
this
kind
in
a
vessel
anchored
just
out
of
sight
of
our
station
word
was
brought
to
me
that
some
boys
were
stolen
and
the
relatives
wished
me
to
go
and
get
them
back
the
facts
were
as
i
found
that
six
boys
had
recruited
had
rushed
into
the
boat
the
government
agent
informed
me
they
had
all
and
said
the
government
agent
board
they
shall
remain
i
was
assured
that
the
six
boys
were
of
age
and
willing
to
go
yet
on
getting
ready
to
leave
the
ship
i
found
four
of
the
lads
ready
to
come
ashore
in
the
boat
this
i
forbade
one
of
them
jumped
into
the
water
and
persisted
in
coming
ashore
in
my
boat
when
appealed
to
the
government
agent
suggested
that
we
go
and
leave
him
to
be
picked
up
by
the
ship
boat
a
quarter
mile
distant
at
the
time
the
law
and
the
missionaries
feel
for
the
repentant
recruit
and
properly
one
may
be
permitted
to
think
for
he
is
only
a
youth
and
ignorant
and
persuadable
to
his
hurt
but
sympathy
for
him
is
not
kept
in
stock
by
the
recruiter
rev
gray
says
a
captain
many
years
in
the
traffic
explained
to
me
how
a
penitent
could
betaken
a
boy
jumps
overboard
we
just
take
a
boat
and
pull
ahead
of
him
then
lie
between
him
and
the
shore
if
he
has
not
tired
himself
swimming
and
passes
the
boat
keep
on
heading
him
in
this
way
the
dodge
rarely
fails
the
boy
generally
tires
of
swimming
gets
into
the
boat
of
his
own
accord
and
goes
quietly
on
board
yes
exhaustion
is
likely
to
make
a
boy
quiet
if
the
distressed
boy
had
been
the
speaker
son
and
the
captors
savages
the
speaker
would
have
been
surprised
to
see
how
differently
the
thing
looked
from
the
new
point
of
view
however
it
is
not
our
custom
to
put
ourselves
in
the
other
person
place
somehow
there
is
something
pathetic
about
that
disappointed
young
savage
resignation
i
must
explain
here
that
in
the
traffic
dialect
boy
does
not
always
mean
boy
it
means
a
youth
above
sixteen
years
of
age
that
is
by
queensland
law
the
age
of
consent
though
it
is
held
that
recruiters
allow
themselves
some
latitude
in
guessing
at
ages
captain
wawn
of
the
free
spirit
chafes
under
the
annoyance
of
regulations
they
and
the
missionaries
have
poisoned
his
life
he
grieves
for
the
good
old
days
vanished
to
come
no
more
see
him
weep
hear
him
cuss
between
the
lines
for
a
long
time
we
were
allowed
to
apprehend
and
detain
all
deserters
who
had
signed
the
agreement
on
board
ship
but
the
regulations
of
the
act
of
put
a
stop

calls
this

a
farce
there
is
as
much
cruelty
and
injustice
done
to

by

that
are

the

that

are

they

his
reasons
for
his

they
are
too
long
for

here
however
if
the
most

kanaka
advantages
himself
by
a
course
in
civilization
in
queensland
is
a
necklace
and
an
umbrella
and
a
showy
imperfection
in
the
art
of
swearing
it
must
be
that
all
the
profit
of
the
traffic
goes
to
the
white
man
this
could
be
twisted
into
a
plausible
argument
that
the
traffic
ought
to
be
squarely
abolished
however
there
is
reason
for
hope
that
that
can
be
left
alone
to
achieve
itself
it
is
claimed
that
the
traffic
will
depopulate
its
sources
of
supply
within
the
next
twenty
or
thirty
years
queensland
is
a
very
healthy
place
for
white
people
in
of
the
population
but
the
kanaka
is
away
above
that
the
vital
statistics
for

the

to
queensland
with
the
opportunity
to

a
pretty
poor
quality
of

is
twelve
times
as
deadly
for
him
as
war
common
christian
charity
common
humanity
does
seem
to
require
not
only
that
these
people
be
returned
to
their

but
that
war
pestilence
and
famine
be
introduced
among

an
eloquent
prophet

and
fifty
years
ago
in
fact
he
spoke
a
little
too
early
prophecy

a
good

it
is
full
of

this

the

of

thousand

performed

long
ere
its
setting
rays
are
extinguished
in
the
west
its
ascending
beams
have
glittered
on
the

now

he
closes
his

with

invocation
from

come
bright
improvement
on
the
car
of
time
and
rule
the
spacious
world
from

bright

see
with

civilization
and
her
waterbury
and
her
umbrella
and
her
profanity
and
her
machinery
and
her
and
everything
is
going
along
just
as
handsome
but
the
prophet
that
speaks
last
has
an
advantage
over
the
pioneer
in
the
business
rev
gray
says
what
i
am
concerned
about
is
that
we
as
a
christian
nation
should
wipe
out
these
races
to
enrich
ourselves
and
he
closes
his
pamphlet
with
a
grim
indictment
which
is
as
eloquent
in
its
flowerless
straightforward
english
as
is
the
rhapsody
of
the
early
prophet
my
indictment
of
the
labor
traffic
is
this
it
generally
demoralizes
and
always
impoverishes
the
kanaka
deprives
him
of
his
citizenship
and
depopulates
the
islands
fitted
to
his
home
it
is
felt
to
lower
the
dignity
of
the
white
agricultural
laborer
in
queensland
and
beyond
a
doubt
it
lowers
his
wages
there
the
whole
system
is
fraught
with
danger
to
australia
and
the
islands
on
the
score
of
health
on
social
and
political
grounds
the
continuance
of
the
queensland
kanaka
labor
traffic
must
be
a
barrier
to
the
true
federation
of
the
australian
colonies
the
regulations
under
which
the
traffic
exists
in
queensland
are
inadequate
to
prevent
abuses
and
in
the
nature
of
things
they
must
remain
so
the
whole
system
is
contrary
to
the
spirit
and
doctrine
of
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
the
gospel
requires
us
to
help
the
weak
but
the
kanaka
is
fleeced
and
trodden
down
the
of
this
traffic
is
that
the
life
and
liberty
of
a
black
man
are
of
less
value
than
those
of
a
white
man
and
a
traffic
that
has
grown
out
of
will
certainly
remain
to
the
end
not
unlike
its
origin

economize

we
have
been
plowing
among
an

vast

of

catching
now
and
then
a
shadowy
glimpse
of
a
member
of
it
there
does
seem
to
be
a
prodigious
lot
of
islands
this
year
the
map
of
this

is
freckled
and
all
over
with
them
their
number
would
seem
to
be
uncountable
we
are
moving
among

and

in

in

of

the

toward

still
up

up

the

must
take
a
glance
at

wednesday
september
yesterday
we
passed
close
to
an
island
or
so
and
recognized
the
published
fiji
characteristics
a
broad
belt
of
clean
white
coral
sand
around
the
island
back
of
it
a
graceful
fringe
of
leaning
palms
with
native
huts
nestling
cosily
among
the
shrubbery
at
their
bases
back
of
these
a
stretch
of
level
land
clothed
in
tropic
vegetation
back
of
that
rugged
and
picturesque
mountains
a
detail
of
the
immediate
foreground
a
mouldering
ship
perched
high
up
on
a
this
completes
the
composition
and
makes
the
picture
artistically
perfect
in
the
afternoon
we
sighted
suva
the
capital
of
the
group
and
threaded
our
way
into
the
secluded
little
harbor
a
placid
basin
of
brilliant
blue
and
green
water
tucked
snugly
in
among
the
sheltering
hills
a
few
ships
rode
at
anchor
in
it
one
of
them
a
sailing
vessel
flying
the
american
flag
and
they
said
she
came
from
duluth
there
a
journey
duluth
is
several
thousand
miles
from
the
sea
and
yet
she
is
entitled
to
the
proud
name
of
mistress
of
the
commercial
marine
of
the
united
states
of
america
there
is
only
one
free
independent
unsubsidized
american
ship
sailing
the
foreign
seas
and
duluth
owns
it
all
by
itself
that
ship
is
the
american
fleet
all
by
itself
it
causes
the
american
name
and
power
to
be
respected
in
the
far
regions
of
the
globe
all
by
itself
it
certifies
to
the
world
that
the
most
populous
civilized
nation
in
the
earth
has
a
just
pride
in
her
stupendous
stretch
of
and
is
determined
to
assert
and
maintain
her
rightful
place
as
one
of
the
great
maritime
powers
of
the
planet
all
by
itself
it
is
making
foreign
eyes
familiar
with
a
flag
which
they
have
not
seen
before
for
forty
years
outside
of
the
museum
for
what
duluth
has
done
in
building
equipping
and
maintaining
at
her
sole
expense
the
american
foreign
commercial
fleet
and
in
thus
rescuing
the
american
name
from
shame
and
lifting
it
high
for
the
homage
of
the
nations
we
owe
her
a
debt
of
gratitude
which
our
hearts
shall
confess
with
quickened
beats
whenever
her
name
is
named
henceforth
many
national
toasts
will
die
in
the
lapse
of
time
but
while
the
flag
flies
and
the
republic
survives
they
who
live
under
their
shelter
will
still
drink
this
one
standing
and
uncovered
health
and
prosperity
to
thee
o
duluth
american
queen
of
the
alien
seas
began
to
flock
from
the
shore
their
crews
were
the
first
natives
we
had
seen
these
men
carried
no
overplus
of
clothing
and
this
was
wise
for
the
weather
was
hot
handsome
great
dusky
men
they
were
muscular
and
with
faces
full
of
character
and
intelligence
it
would
be
hard
to
find
their
superiors
anywhere
among
the
dark
races
i
should
think
everybody
went
ashore
to
look
around
and
spy
out
the
land
and
have
that
luxury
of
luxuries
to
a
and
there
we
saw
more
natives
wrinkled
old
women
with
their
flat
mammals
flung
over
their
shoulders
or
hanging
down
in
front
like
the
drip
from
the
plump
and
smily
young
girls
blithe
and
content
easy
and
graceful
a
pleasure
to
look
at
young
matrons
tall
straight
comely
nobly
built
sweeping
by
with
chin
up
and
a
gait
incomparable
for
unconscious
stateliness
and
dignity
majestic
young
men
athletes
for
build
and
muscle
clothed
in
a
loose
arrangement
of
dazzling
white
with
bronze
breast
and
bronze
legs
naked
and
the
head
a
of
solid
hair
combed
straight
out
from
the
skull
and
dyed
a
rich
only
sixty
years
ago
they
were
sunk
in
darkness
now
they
have
the
bicycle
we
strolled
about
the
streets
of
the
white
folks
little
town
and
around
over
the
hills
by
paths
and
roads
among
european
dwellings
and
gardens
and
plantations
and
past
clumps
of
hibiscus
that
made
a
body
blink
the
great
blossoms
were
so
intensely
red
and
by
and
by
we
stopped
to
ask
an
elderly
english
colonist
a
question
or
two
and
to
sympathize
with
him
concerning
the
torrid
weather
but
he
was
surprised
and
said
this
this
is
not
hot
you
ought
to
be
here
in
the
summer
time
once
we
supposed
that
this
was
summer
it
has
the
of
it
you
could
take
it
to
almost
any
country
and
deceive
people
with
it
but
if
it
is
summer
what
does
it
lack
it
lacks
half
a
year
this
is
i
had
been
suffering
from
colds
for
several
months
and
a
sudden
change
of
season
like
this
could
hardly
fail
to
do
me
hurt
it
brought
on
another
cold
it
is
odd
these
sudden
jumps
from
season
to
season
a
fortnight
ago
we
left
america
in
now
it
is
midwinter
about
a
week
hence
we
shall
arrive
in
australia
in
the
spring
after
dinner
i
found
in
the
a
resident
whom
i
had
known
somewhere
else
in
the
world
and
presently
made
some
new
friends
and
drove
with
them
out
into
the
country
to
visit
his
excellency
the
head
of
the
state
who
was
occupying
his
country
residence
to
escape
the
rigors
of
the
winter
weather
i
suppose
for
it
was
on
breezy
high
ground
and
much
more
comfortable
than
the
lower
regions
where
the
town
is
and
where
the
winter
has
full
swing
and
often
sets
a
person
hair
afire
when
he
takes
off
his
hat
to
bow
there
is
a
noble
and
beautiful
view
of
ocean
and
islands
and
castellated
peaks
from
the
governor
house
and
its
immediate
surroundings
lie
drowsing
in
that
dreamy
repose
and
serenity
which
are
the
charm
of
life
in
the
pacific
islands
one
of
the
new
friends
who
went
out
there
with
me
was
a
large
man
and
i
had
been
admiring
his
size
all
the
way
i
was
still
admiring
it
as
he
stood
by
the
governor
on
the
veranda
talking
then
the
fijian
butler
stepped
out
there
to
announce
tea
and
dwarfed
him
maybe
he
did
not
quite
dwarf
him
but
at
any
rate
the
contrast
was
quite
striking
perhaps
that
dark
giant
was
a
king
in
a
condition
of
political
suspension
i
think
that
in
the
talk
there
on
the
veranda
it
was
said
that
in
fiji
as
in
the
sandwich
islands
native
kings
and
chiefs
are
of
much
grander
size
and
build
than
the
commoners
this
man
was
clothed
in
flowing
white
vestments
and
they
were
just
the
thing
for
him
they
comported
well
with
his
great
stature
and
his
kingly
port
and
dignity
european
clothes
would
have
degraded
him
and
made
him
commonplace
i
know
that
because
they
do
that
with
everybody
that
wears
them
it
was
said
that
the
devotion
to
chiefs
and
reverence
for
their
persons
still
survive
in
the
native
commoner
and
in
great
force
the
educated
young
gentleman
who
is
chief
of
the
tribe
that
live
in
the
region
about
the
capital
dresses
in
the
fashion
of
european
gentlemen
but
even
his
clothes
can
not
damn
him
in
the
reverence
of
his
people
their
pride
in
his
lofty
rank
and
ancient
lineage
lives
on
in
spite
of
his
lost
authority
and
the
evil
magic
of
his
tailor
he
has
no
need
to
defile
himself
with
work
or
trouble
his
heart
with
the
sordid
cares
of
life
the
tribe
will
see
to
it
that
he
shall
not
want
and
that
he
shall
hold
up
his
head
and
live
like
a
gentleman
i
had
a
glimpse
of
him
down
in
the
town
perhaps
he
is
a
descendant
of
the
last
king
the
king
with
the
difficult
name
whose
memory
is
preserved
by
a
notable
monument
of
which
one
sees
in
the
enclosure
in
the
middle
of
the
town
thakombau
i
remember
now
that
is
the
name
it
is
easier
to
preserve
it
on
a
granite
block
than
in
your
head
fiji
was
ceded
to
england
by
this
king
in
one
of
the
gentlemen
present
at
the
governor
quoted
a
remark
made
by
the
king
at
the
time
of
the
session
a
neat
retort
and
with
a
touch
of
pathos
in
it
too
the
english
commissioner
had
offered
a
crumb
of
comfort
to
thakombau
by
saying
that
the
transfer
of
the
kingdom
to
great
britain
was
merely
a
sort
of
formality
you
know
yes
said
poor
thakombau
but
with
this
difference
the
crab
moves
into
an
unoccupied
shell
but
mine
is
however
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
from
the
books
the
king
was
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
sea
at
the
time
and
had
much
choice
he
owed
the
united
states
a
large
debt
a
debt
which
he
could
pay
if
allowed
time
but
time
was
denied
him
he
must
pay
up
right
away
or
the
warships
would
be
upon
him
to
protect
his
people
from
this
disaster
he
ceded
his
country
to
britain
with
a
clause
in
the
contract
providing
for
the
ultimate
payment
of
the
american
debt
in
old
times
the
fijians
were
fierce
fighters
they
were
very
religious
and
worshiped
idols
the
big
chiefs
were
proud
and
haughty
and
they
were
men
of
great
style
in
many
ways
all
chiefs
had
several
wives
the
biggest
chiefs
sometimes
had
as
many
as
fifty
when
a
chief
was
dead
and
ready
for
burial
four
or
five
of
his
wives
were
strangled
and
put
into
the
grave
with
him
in
british
convicts
escaped
from
australia
to
fiji
and
brought
guns
and
ammunition
with
them
consider
what
a
power
they
were
armed
like
that
and
what
an
opportunity
they
had
if
they
had
been
energetic
men
and
sober
and
had
had
brains
and
known
how
to
use
them
they
could
have
achieved
the
sovereignty
of
the
archipelago
kings
and
each
with
eight
or
nine
islands
under
his
scepter
but
nothing
came
of
this
chance
they
lived
worthless
lives
of
sin
and
luxury
and
died
without
honor
in
most
cases
by
violence
only
one
of
them
had
any
ambition
he
was
an
irishman
named
connor
he
tried
to
raise
a
family
of
fifty
children
and
scored
he
died
lamenting
his
failure
it
was
a
foolish
sort
of
avarice
many
a
father
would
have
been
rich
enough
with
forty
it
is
a
fine
race
the
fijians
with
brains
in
their
heads
and
an
inquiring
turn
of
mind
it
appears
that
their
savage
ancestors
had
a
doctrine
of
immortality
in
their
scheme
of
religion
with
limitations
that
is
to
say
their
dead
friend
would
go
to
a
happy
hereafter
if
he
could
be
accumulated
but
not
otherwise
they
drew
the
line
they
thought
that
the
missionary
doctrine
was
too
sweeping
too
comprehensive
they
called
his
attention
to
certain
facts
for
instance
many
of
their
friends
had
been
devoured
by
sharks
the
sharks
in
their
turn
were
caught
and
eaten
by
other
men
later
these
men
were
captured
in
war
and
eaten
by
the
enemy
the
original
persons
had
entered
into
the
composition
of
the
sharks
next
they
and
the
sharks
had
become
part
of
the
flesh
and
blood
and
bone
of
the
cannibals
how
then
could
the
particles
of
the
original
men
be
searched
out
from
the
final
conglomerate
and
put
together
again
the
inquirers
were
full
of
doubts
and
considered
that
the
missionary
had
not
examined
the
matter
with
the
gravity
and
attention
which
so
serious
a
thing
deserved
the
missionary
taught
these
exacting
savages
many
valuable
things
and
got
from
them
one
a
very
dainty
and
poetical
idea
those
wild
and
ignorant
poor
children
of
nature
believed
that
the
flowers
after
they
perish
rise
on
the
winds
and
float
away
to
the
fair
fields
of
heaven
and
flourish
there
forever
in
immortal
beauty

it
could
probably
be
shown
by
facts
and
figures
that
there
is
no
distinctly
native
american
criminal
class
except
congress
wilson
new
calendar
when
one
glances
at
the
map
the
members
of
the
stupendous
island
wilderness
of
the
pacific
seem
to
crowd
upon
each
other
but
no
there
is
no
crowding
even
in
the
center
of
a
group
and
between
groups
there
are
lonely
wide
deserts
of
sea
not
everything
is
known
about
the
islands
their
peoples
and
their
languages
a
startling
reminder
of
this
is
furnished
by
the
fact
that
in
fiji
twenty
years
ago
were
living
two
strange
and
solitary
beings
who
came
from
an
unknown
country
and
spoke
an
unknown
language
they
were
picked
up
by
a
passing
vessel
many
hundreds
of
miles
from
any
known
land
floating
in
the
same
tiny
canoe
in
which
they
had
been
blown
out
to
sea
when
found
they
were
but
skin
and
bone
no
one
could
understand
what
they
said
and
they
have
never
named
their
country
or
if
they
have
the
name
does
not
correspond
with
that
of
any
island
on
any
chart
they
are
now
fat
and
sleek
and
as
happy
as
the
day
is
long
in
the
ship
log
there
is
an
entry
of
the
latitude
and
longitude
in
which
they
were
found
and
this
is
probably
all
the
clue
they
will
ever
have
to
their
lost
homes
forbes
two
years
in
fiji
what
a
strange
and
romantic
episode
it
is
and
how
one
is
tortured
with
curiosity
to
know
whence
those
mysterious
creatures
came
those
men
without
a
country
errant
waifs
who
can
not
name
their
lost
home
wandering
children
of
nowhere
indeed
the
island
wilderness
is
the
very
home
of
romance
and
dreams
and
mystery
the
loneliness
the
solemnity
the
beauty
and
the
deep
repose
of
this
wilderness
have
a
charm
which
is
all
their
own
for
the
bruised
spirit
of
men
who
have
fought
and
failed
in
the
struggle
for
life
in
the
great
world
and
for
men
who
have
been
hunted
out
of
the
great
world
for
crime
and
for
other
men
who
love
an
easy
and
indolent
existence
and
for
others
who
love
a
roving
free
life
and
stir
and
change
and
adventure
and
for
yet
others
who
love
an
easy
and
comfortable
career
of
trading
and
mixed
with
plenty
of
loose
matrimony
by
purchase
divorce
without
trial
or
expense
and
limitless
spreeing
thrown
in
to
make
life
ideally
perfect
we
sailed
again
refreshed
the
most
cultivated
person
in
the
ship
was
a
young
english
man
whose
home
was
in
new
zealand
he
was
a
naturalist
his
learning
in
his
specialty
was
deep
and
thorough
his
interest
in
his
subject
amounted
to
a
passion
he
had
an
easy
gift
of
speech
and
so
when
he
talked
about
animals
it
was
a
pleasure
to
listen
to
him
and
profitable
too
though
he
was
sometimes
difficult
to
understand
because
now
and
then
he
used
scientific
technicalities
which
were
above
the
reach
of
some
of
us
they
were
pretty
sure
to
be
above
my
reach
but
as
he
was
quite
willing
to
explain
them
i
always
made
it
a
point
to
get
him
to
do
it
i
had
a
fair
knowledge
of
his
subject
layman
knowledge
to
begin
with
but
it
was
his
teachings
which
crystalized
it
into
scientific
form
and
clarity
in
a
word
gave
it
value
his
special
interest
was
the
fauna
of
australasia
and
his
knowledge
of
the
matter
was
as
exhaustive
as
it
was
accurate
i
already
knew
a
good
deal
about
the
rabbits
in
australasia
and
their
marvelous
fecundity
but
in
my
talks
with
him
i
found
that
my
estimate
of
the
great
hindrance
and
obstruction
inflicted
by
the
rabbit
pest
upon
traffic
and
travel
was
far
short
of
the
facts
he
told
me
that
the
first
pair
of
rabbits
imported
into
australasia
bred
so
wonderfully
that
within
six
months
rabbits
were
so
thick
in
the
land
that
people
had
to
dig
trenches
through
them
to
get
from
town
to
town
he
told
me
a
great
deal
about
worms
and
the
kangaroo
and
other
coleoptera
and
said
he
knew
the
history
and
ways
of
all
such
pachydermata
he
said
the
kangaroo
had
pockets
and
carried
its
young
in
them
when
it
could
get
apples
and
he
said
that
the
emu
was
as
big
as
an
ostrich
and
looked
like
one
and
had
an
amorphous
appetite
and
would
eat
bricks
also
that
the
dingo
was
not
a
dingo
at
all
but
just
a
wild
dog
and
that
the
only
difference
between
a
dingo
and
a
dodo
was
that
neither
of
them
barked
otherwise
they
were
just
the
same
he
said
that
the
only
in
australia
was
the
wombat
and
the
only
the
larrikin
and
that
both
were
protected
by
government
the
most
beautiful
of
the
native
birds
was
the
bird
of
paradise
next
came
the
two
kinds
of
lyres
not
spelt
the
same
he
said
the
one
kind
was
dying
out
the
other
thickening
up
he
explained
that
the
sundowner
was
not
a
bird
it
was
a
man
sundowner
was
merely
the
australian
equivalent
of
our
word
tramp
he
is
a
loafer
a
hard
drinker
and
a
sponge
he
tramps
across
the
country
in
the
season
pretending
to
look
for
work
but
he
always
times
himself
to
arrive
at
a
just
at
sundown
when
the
day
labor
ends
all
he
wants
is
whisky
and
supper
and
bed
and
breakfast
he
gets
them
and
then
disappears
the
naturalist
spoke
of
the
bell
bird
the
creature
that
at
short
intervals
all
day
rings
out
its
mellow
and
exquisite
peal
from
the
deeps
of
the
forest
it
is
the
favorite
and
best
friend
of
the
weary
and
thirsty
sundowner
for
he
knows
that
wherever
the
bell
bird
is
there
is
water
and
he
goes
somewhere
else
the
naturalist
said
that
the
oddest
bird
in
australasia
was
the
laughing
jackass
and
the
biggest
the
now
extinct
great
moa
the
moa
stood
thirteen
feet
high
and
could
step
over
an
ordinary
head
or
kick
his
hat
off
and
his
head
too
for
that
matter
he
said
it
was
wingless
but
a
swift
runner
the
natives
used
to
ride
it
it
could
make
forty
miles
an
hour
and
keep
it
up
for
four
hundred
miles
and
come
out
reasonably
fresh
it
was
still
in
existence
when
the
railway
was
introduced
into
new
zealand
still
in
existence
and
carrying
the
mails
the
railroad
began
with
the
same
schedule
it
has
now
two
expresses
a
twenty
miles
an
hour
the
company
exterminated
the
moa
to
get
the
mails
speaking
of
the
indigenous
coneys
and
bactrian
camels
the
naturalist
said
that
the
coniferous
and
bacteriological
output
of
australasia
was
remarkable
for
its
many
and
curious
departures
from
the
accepted
laws
governing
these
species
of
tubercles
but
that
in
his
opinion
fondness
for
dabbling
in
the
erratic
was
most
notably
exhibited
in
that
curious
combination
of
bird
fish
amphibian
burrower
crawler
quadruped
and
christian
called
the
ornithorhynchus
grotesquest
of
animals
king
of
the
animalculae
of
the
world
for
versatility
of
character
and
said
he
you
can
call
it
anything
you
want
to
and
be
right
it
is
a
fish
for
it
lives
in
the
river
half
the
time
it
is
a
land
animal
for
it
resides
on
the
land
half
the
time
it
is
an
amphibian
since
it
likes
both
and
does
not
know
which
it
prefers
it
is
a
hybernian
for
when
times
are
dull
and
nothing
much
going
on
it
buries
itself
under
the
mud
at
the
bottom
of
a
puddle
and
hybernates
there
a
couple
of
weeks
at
a
time
it
is
a
kind
of
duck
for
it
has
a
and
four
webbed
paddles
it
is
a
fish
and
quadruped
together
for
in
the
water
it
swims
with
the
paddles
and
on
shore
it
paws
itself
across
country
with
them
it
is
a
kind
of
seal
for
it
has
a
seal
fur
it
is
carnivorous
herbivorous
insectivorous
and
vermifuginous
for
it
eats
fish
and
grass
and
butterflies
and
in
the
season
digs
worms
out
of
the
mud
and
devours
them
it
is
clearly
a
bird
for
it
lays
eggs
and
hatches
them
it
is
clearly
a
mammal
for
it
nurses
its
young
and
it
is
manifestly
a
kind
of
christian
for
it
keeps
the
sabbath
when
there
is
anybody
around
and
when
there
is
does
it
has
all
the
tastes
there
are
except
refined
ones
it
has
all
the
habits
there
are
except
good
ones
it
is
a
survival
a
survival
of
the
fittest
darwin
invented
the
theory
that
goes
by
that
name
but
the
ornithorhynchus
was
the
first
to
put
it
to
actual
experiment
and
prove
that
it
could
be
done
hence
it
should
have
as
much
of
the
credit
as
darwin
it
was
never
in
the
ark
you
will
find
no
mention
of
it
there
it
nobly
stayed
out
and
worked
the
theory
of
all
creatures
in
the
world
it
was
the
only
one
properly
equipped
for
the
test
the
ark
was
thirteen
months
afloat
and
all
the
globe
submerged
no
land
visible
above
the
flood
no
vegetation
no
food
for
a
mammal
to
eat
nor
water
for
a
mammal
to
drink
for
all
mammal
food
was
destroyed
and
when
the
pure
floods
from
heaven
and
the
salt
oceans
of
the
earth
mingled
their
waters
and
rose
above
the
mountain
tops
the
result
was
a
drink
which
no
bird
or
beast
of
ordinary
construction
could
use
and
live
but
this
combination
was
nuts
for
the
ornithorhynchus
if
i
may
use
a
term
like
that
without
offense
its
river
home
had
always
been
salted
by
the
of
the
sea
on
the
face
of
the
noachian
deluge
innumerable
forest
trees
were
floating
upon
these
the
ornithorhynchus
voyaged
in
peace
voyaged
from
clime
to
clime
from
hemisphere
to
hemisphere
in
contentment
and
comfort
in
virile
interest
in
the
constant
change
of
scene
in
humble
thankfulness
for
its
privileges
in
enthusiasm
in
the
development
of
the
great
theory
upon
whose
validity
it
had
staked
its
life
its
fortunes
and
its
sacred
honor
if
i
may
use
such
expressions
without
impropriety
in
connection
with
an
episode
of
this
nature
it
lived
the
tranquil
and
luxurious
life
of
a
creature
of
independent
means
of
things
actually
necessary
to
its
existence
and
its
happiness
not
a
detail
was
wanting
when
it
wished
to
walk
it
scrambled
along
the
it
mused
in
the
shade
of
the
leaves
by
day
it
slept
in
their
shelter
by
night
when
it
wanted
the
refreshment
of
a
swim
it
had
it
it
ate
leaves
when
it
wanted
a
vegetable
diet
it
dug
under
the
bark
for
worms
and
grubs
when
it
wanted
fish
it
caught
them
when
it
wanted
eggs
it
laid
them
if
the
grubs
gave
out
in
one
tree
it
swam
to
another
and
as
for
fish
the
very
opulence
of
the
supply
was
an
embarrassment
and
finally
when
it
was
thirsty
it
smacked
its
chops
in
gratitude
over
a
blend
that
would
have
slain
a
crocodile
when
at
last
after
thirteen
months
of
travel
and
research
in
all
the
zones
it
went
aground
on
a
it
strode
ashore
saying
in
its
heart
them
that
come
after
me
invent
theories
and
dream
dreams
about
the
survival
of
the
fittest
if
they
like
but
i
am
the
first
that
has
done
it
this
wonderful
creature
dates
back
like
the
kangaroo
and
many
other
australian
hydrocephalous
invertebrates
to
an
age
long
anterior
to
the
advent
of
man
upon
the
earth
they
date
back
indeed
to
a
time
when
a
causeway
hundreds
of
miles
wide
and
thousands
of
miles
long
joined
australia
to
africa
and
the
animals
of
the
two
countries
were
alike
and
all
belonged
to
that
remote
geological
epoch
known
to
science
as
the
old
red
grindstone
later
the
causeway
sank
under
the
sea
subterranean
convulsions
lifted
the
african
continent
a
thousand
feet
higher
than
it
was
before
but
australia
kept
her
old
level
in
africa
new
climate
the
animals
necessarily
began
to
develop
and
shade
off
into
new
forms
and
families
and
species
but
the
animals
of
australia
as
necessarily
remained
stationary
and
have
so
remained
until
this
day
in
the
course
of
some
millions
of
years
the
african
ornithorhynchus
developed
and
developed
and
developed
and
sluffed
off
detail
after
detail
of
its
until
at
last
the
creature
became
wholly
disintegrated
and
scattered
whenever
you
see
a
bird
or
a
beast
or
a
seal
or
an
otter
in
africa
you
know
that
he
is
merely
a
sorry
surviving
fragment
of
that
sublime
original
of
whom
i
have
been
speaking
that
creature
which
was
everything
in
general
and
nothing
in
particular
the
opulently
endowed
pluribus
unum
of
the
animal
world
such
is
the
history
of
the
most
hoary
the
most
ancient
the
most
venerable
creature
that
exists
in
the
earth
today
ornithorhynchus
platypus
extraordinariensis
whom
god
preserve
when
he
was
strongly
moved
he
could
rise
and
soar
like
that
with
ease
and
not
only
in
the
prose
form
but
in
the
poetical
as
well
he
had
written
many
pieces
of
poetry
in
his
time
and
these
manuscripts
he
lent
around
among
the
passengers
and
was
willing
to
let
them
be
copied
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
least
technical
one
in
the
series
and
the
one
which
reached
the
loftiest
note
perhaps
was
his
invocation
come
forth
from
thy
oozy
couch
o
ornithorhynchus
dear
and
greet
with
a
cordial
claw
the
stranger
that
longs
to
hear
from
thy
own
own
lips
the
tale
of
thy
origin
all
unknown
thy
misplaced
bone
where
flesh
should
be
and
flesh
where
should
be
bone
and
fishy
fin
where
should
be
paw
and
tail
and
snout
of
beast
equip
with

where
gills
ought
to
prevail
come

the
good

foreshortened
as
to
legs
and
body
tapered

a
churn

marsupial

tells
us
why
you
linger
here
thou
relic
of
a
vanished
time
when
all
your
friends
as
fossils
sleep
immortalized
in
lime
perhaps
no
poet
is
a
conscious
plagiarist
but
there
seems
to
be
warrant
for
suspecting
that
there
is
no
poet
who
is
not
at
one
time
or
another
an
unconscious
one
the
above
verses
are
indeed
beautiful
and
in
a
way
touching
but
there
is
a
haunting
something
about
them
which
unavoidably
suggests
the
sweet
singer
of
michigan
it
can
hardly
be
doubted
that
the
author
had
read
the
works
of
that
poet
and
been
impressed
by
them
it
is
not
apparent
that
he
has
borrowed
from
them
any
word
or
yet
any
phrase
but
the
style
and
swing
and
mastery
and
melody
of
the
sweet
singer
all
are
there
compare
this
invocation
with
frank
dutton
particularly
stanzas
first

seventeenth

i
think
the
reader
will
feel
convinced
that
he
who
wrote
the
one
had
read
the
other
i
frank
dutton
was
as
fine

ever

the

for
