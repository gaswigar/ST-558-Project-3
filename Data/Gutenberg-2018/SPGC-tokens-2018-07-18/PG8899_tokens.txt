three
weeks
by
elinor
glyn
introduction
to
my
american
readers
i
feel
now
when
my
three
weeks
is
to
be
launched
in
a
new
land
where
i
have
many
sympathetic
friends
that
owing
to
the
misunderstanding
and
misrepresentation
it
received
from
nearly
the
entire
press
and
a
section
of
the
public
in
england
i
would
like
to
state
my
view
of
its
meaning
as
i
wrote
it
i
suppose
it
could
be
believed
i
know
something
about
that
for
me
the
lady
was
a
deep
study
the
analysis
of
a
strange
slav
nature
who
from
circumstances
and
education
and
her
general
view
of
life
was
beyond
the
ordinary
laws
of
morality
if
i
were
making
the
study
of
a
tiger
i
would
not
give
it
the
attributes
of
a
spaniel
because
the
public
and
i
myself
might
prefer
a
spaniel
i
would
still
seek
to
portray
accurately
every
minute
instinct
of
that
tiger
to
make
a
living
picture
thus
as
you
read
i
want
you
to
think
of
her
as
such
a
study
a
great
splendid
nature
full
of
the
passionate
realisation
of
primitive
instincts
immensely
cultivated
polished
blasé
you
must
see
her
at
lucerne
obsessed
with
the
knowledge
of
her
horrible
life
with
her
brutal
vicious
husband
to
whom
she
had
been
sacrificed
for
political
reasons
when
almost
a
child
she
suddenly
sees
this
young
englishman
who
comes
as
an
echo
of
something
straight
and
true
in
manhood
which
in
outward
appearance
at
all
events
she
has
met
in
her
youth
in
the
person
of
his
uncle
hubert
she
perceives
in
him
at
once
the
soul
sleeping
there
and
it
produces
in
her
a
strong
emotion
then
i
want
you
to
understand
the
effect
of
love
on
them
both
in
her
it
rose
from
caprice
to
intense
devotion
until
the
day
at
the
farm
when
it
reached
the
highest
point
a
desire
to
reproduce
his
likeness
how
with
the
most
passionate
physical
emotion
her
mental
influence
upon
paul
was
ever
to
raise
him
to
vast
aims
and
noble
desires
for
future
greatness
in
him
love
opened
the
windows
of
his
soul
so
that
he
saw
the
fine
in
everything
the
immense
rush
of
passion
in
venice
came
from
her
knowledge
that
they
soon
must
part
notice
the
effect
of
the
two
griefs
on
paul
the
first
with
its
undefined
hope
making
him
do
well
in
all
things
even
his
prowess
as
a
hunter
to
raise
himself
to
be
more
worthy
in
her
eyes
the
second
and
paralysing
one
of
death
turning
him
into
adamant
until
his
soul
awakens
again
with
the
returning
spring
of
her
spirit
in
his
heart
and
the
consolation
of
the
living
essence
of
their
love
in
the
child
the
minds
of
some
human
beings
are
as
moles
grubbing
in
the
earth
for
worms
they
have
no
eyes
to
see
god
sky
with
the
stars
in
it
to
such
three
weeks
will
be
but
a
sensual
record
of
passion
but
those
who
do
look
up
beyond
the
material
will
understand
the
deep
pure
love
and
the
soul
in
it
all
and
they
will
realise
that
to
such
a
nature
as
the
lady
passion
would
never
have
run
riot
until
it
was
sated
she
would
have
daily
grown
nobler
in
her
desire
to
make
her
loved
one
son
a
splendid
man
and
to
all
who
read
i
say
at
least
be
just
and
do
not
skip
no
line
is
written
without
its
having
a
bearing
upon
the
next
and
in
its
small
scope
helping
to
make
the
presentment
of
these
two
human
beings
vivid
and
clear
the
verdict
i
must
leave
to
the
public
but
now
at
all
events
you
know
kind
reader
that
the
imperatorskoye
appears
a
noble
woman
because
she
was
absolutely
faithful
to
the
man
she
had
selected
as
her
mate
through
the
one
motive
which
makes
a
union
moral
in
ethics

three
weeks
chapter
i
now
this
is
an
episode
in
a
young
man
life
and
has
no
real
beginning
or
ending
and
you
who
are
old
and
have
forgotten
the
passions
of
youth
may
condemn
it
but
there
are
others
who
are
neither
old
nor
young
who
perhaps
will
understand
and
find
some
interest
in
the
study
of
a
strange
woman
who
made
the
illumination
of
a
brief
space
paul
verdayne
was
young
and
fresh
and
foolish
when
his
episode
began
he
believed
in
himself
he
believed
in
his
mother
and
in
a
number
of
other
worthy
things
life
was
full
of
certainties
for
him
he
was
certain
he
liked
hunting
better
than
anything
else
in
the
world
for
instance
he
was
certain
he
knew
his
own
mind
and
therefore
perfectly
certain
his
passion
for
isabella
waring
would
last
for
ever
ready
to
swear
eternal
devotion
with
that
delightful
inconsequence
of
youth
in
its
unreason
thinking
to
control
an
emotion
as
canute
flatterers
would
have
had
him
do
the
waves
and
the
creator
of
waves
and
emotions
no
doubt
smiled
to
himself
if
he
is
not
tired
by
now
of
smiling
at
the
follies
of
the
moles
called
human
beings
who
for
the
most
part
inhabit
his
earth
paul
was
young
as
i
said
and
fair
and
strong
he
had
been
in
the
eleven
at
eton
and
left
oxford
with
a
record
for
all
that
should
turn
a
beautiful
englishman
into
a
perfect
athlete
books
had
not
worried
him
much
the
fit
of
a
the
pace
of
a
horse
were
things
of
more
importance
but
he
scraped
through
his
smalls
and
his
mods
and
was
considered
by
his
friends
to
be
anything
but
a
fool
as
for
his
mother
the
lady
henrietta
verdayne
she
thought
him
a
god
among
men
paul
went
to
london
like
others
of
his
time
and
attended
the
theatres
where
perfectly
virtuous
young
ladies
display
nightly
their
innocent
charms
in
hilarious
choruses
arrayed
in
the
latest
he
supped
too
with
these
houris
and
felt
himself
a
man
of
the
world
he
had
stayed
about
in
country
houses
for
perhaps
a
year
and
had
danced
through
the
whole
of
a
season
with
all
the
prettiest
and
one
or
two
of
the
young
married
women
of
forty
had
already
marked
him
out
for
their
prey
by
all
this
you
can
see
just
the
kind
of
creature
paul
was
there
are
hundreds
of
others
like
him
and
perhaps
they
too
have
the
latent
qualities
which
he
developed
during
his
episode
only
they
remain
as
he
was
in
the
beginning
sound
asleep
that
fall
out
hunting
in
march
and
being
laid
up
with
a
sprained
ankle
and
a
broken
proved
the
commencement
of
the
isabella
waring
affair
she
was
the
parson
daughter
and
is
still
for
the
matter
of
that
and
often
in
those
days
between
her
games
of
golf
and
hockey
or
a
good
run
on
her
feet
with
the
hounds
she
came
up
to
verdayne
place
to
write
lady
henrietta
letters
for
her
isabella
was
most
amiable
and
delighted
to
make
herself
useful
and
if
her
hands
were
big
and
red
she
wrote
clearly
and
well
the
lady
henrietta
who
herself
was
of
the
delicate
later
victorian
dresden
china
type
could
not
imagine
a
state
of
things
which
contained
the
fact
that
her
son
might
stoop
to
this
daughter
of
the
earthy
earth
yet
so
it
fell
about
isabella
read
aloud
the
sporting
papers
to
him
isabella
played
piquet
with
him
in
the
dull
late
afternoons
of
his
convalescence
isabella
herself
washed
his
dog
pike
that
king
of
rough
terriers
and
one
terrible
day
paul
unfortunately
kissed
the
large
pink
lips
of
isabella
as
his
mother
entered
the
room
i
will
draw
a
veil
over
this
part
of
his
life
the
lady
henrietta
being
a
great
lady
chanced
to
behave
as
such
on
the
occasion
referred
to
but
she
was
also
a
woman
and
not
a
particularly
clever
one
thus
paul
was
soon
irritated
by
opposition
into
thinking
himself
seriously
in
love
with
this
daughter
of
the
middle
classes
so
far
beneath
his
noble
station
let
the
boy
have
his
fling
said
sir
charles
verdayne
who
was
a
coarse
person
damn
it
all
a
man
is
not
obliged
to
marry
every
woman
he
kisses
a
gentlemen
does
not
deliberately
kiss
an
unmarried
girl
unless
he
intends
to
make
her
his
wife
retorted
lady
henrietta
i
fear
the
worst
sir
charles
snorted
and
chuckled
two
unpleasant
and
annoying
habits
his
lady
wife
had
never
been
able
to
break
him
of
so
the
affair
grew
and
grew
until
towards
the
middle
of
april
paul
was
advised
to
travel
for
his
health
your
father
and
i
can
sanction
no
engagement
paul
before
you
return
said
lady
henrietta
if
in
july
on
your
birthday
you
still
wish
to
break
your
mother
heart
i
suppose
you
must
do
so
but
i
ask
of
you
the
unfettered
reflection
of
three
months
first
this
seemed
reasonable
enough
and
paul
consented
to
start
upon
a
tour
round
europe
not
having
spoken
the
final
fatal
and
binding
words
to
isabella
waring
they
made
their
adieux
in
the
pouring
rain
under
a
dripping
oak
in
the
lane
by
the
vicarage
gate
paul
was
six
foot
two
and
isabella
quite
six
foot
and
broad
in
proportion
they
were
dressed
almost
alike
and
at
a
little
distance
but
for
the
lady
scanty
petticoat
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
distinguish
her
sex
old
chap
she
said
we
have
been
real
pals
and
i
not
forget
you
but
paul
who
was
feeling
sentimental
put
it
differently
darling
he
whispered
with
a
suspicion
of
tremble
in
his
charming
voice
i
shall
never
love
any
woman
but
you
never
never
in
my
life
cuckoo
screamed
the
bird
in
the
tree
and
now
we
are
getting
nearer
the
episode
paris
bored
paul
he
did
not
know
its
joys
and
was
in
no
mood
to
learn
them
he
mooned
about
and
went
to
the
races
his
french
was
too
indifferent
to
make
theatres
a
pleasure
and
the
attractive
ladies
who
smiled
at
his
blue
eyes
were
for
him
a
man
so
recently
parted
from
the
only
woman
he
could
ever
love
had
no
right
to
look
at
such
things
he
thought
how
young
and
chivalrous
and
honest
he
was
poor
paul
so
he
took
to
visiting
versailles
and
fontainebleau
and
compiègne
with
a
and
came
to
the
conclusion
it
was
all
beastly
rot
so
he
turned
his
back
upon
france
and
fled
to
switzerland
do
you
know
switzerland
you
who
read
do
you
know
it
at
the
beginning
of
may
a
feast
of
blue
lakes
and
and
the
divinest
green
of
young
beeches
and
the
sombre
shadow
of
dark
firs
and
the
exhilaration
of
the
air
if
you
do
i
need
not
tell
you
about
it
only
in
any
case
now
you
must
see
it
through
the
eyes
of
paul
that
is
if
you
intend
to
read
another
page
of
this
bad
book
it
was
pouring
with
rain
when
he
drove
from
the
station
to
the
hotel
his
temper
was
at
its
worst
pilatus
hid
his
head
in
mist
the
bürgenstock
was
invisible
it
was
chilly
too
and
the
fire
smoked
in
the
when
paul
had
it
lighted
his
heart
yearned
for
his
own
snug
room
at
verdayne
place
and
the
jolly
voice
of
isabella
waring
counting
point
quint
and
quatorze
what
nonsense
to
send
him
abroad
as
if
such
treatment
could
be
effectual
as
a
cure
for
a
love
like
his
he
almost
laughed
at
his
mother
folly
how
he
longed
to
sit
down
and
write
to
his
darling
write
and
tell
how
he
hated
it
all
and
was
only
getting
through
the
time
until
he
saw
her
six
feet
of
buxom
charms
again
only
paul
did
not
put
it
like
that
indeed
he
never
thought
about
her
charms
at
all
or
want
of
them
he
analysed
nothing
he
was
sound
asleep
you
see
to
as
yet
he
was
just
a
splendid
english
young
animal
of
the
best
class
he
had
promised
not
to
write
to
isabella
or
if
he
at
least
not
to
write
a
dear
boy
the
lady
henrietta
had
said
when
giving
him
her
fond
parting
kiss
if
you
are
very
unhappy
and
feel
you
greatly
wish
to
write
to
miss
waring
i
suppose
you
must
do
so
but
let
your
letter
be
about
the
scenery
and
the
impressions
of
travel
in
no
way
to
be
interpreted
into
a
declaration
of
affection
or
a
promise
of
future
union
i
have
your
word
paul
for
that
and
paul
had
given
his
word
all
right
mother
i
promise
for
three
months
and
now
on
this
wet
evening
the
must
had
come
so
he
pulled
out
some
hotel
paper
and
began
my
dear
isabella
i
say
you
know
i
hate
beginning
like
this
i
have
arrived
at
this
beastly
place
and
i
am
awfully
unhappy
i
think
it
would
have
been
better
if
i
had
brought
pike
with
me
only
those
rotten
laws
about
getting
the
little
chap
back
to
england
would
have
been
hard
how
is
moonlighter
and
have
they
really
looked
after
that
strain
do
you
gather
make
tremlett
come
down
and
report
progress
to
you
daily
i
told
him
to
my
rooms
look
out
on
a
beastly
lake
and
there
are
mountains
i
suppose
but
i
ca
see
them
there
is
hardly
any
one
in
the
hotel
because
the
easter
visitors
have
all
gone
back
and
the
summer
ones
have
come
so
i
doubt
even
if
i
can
have
a
game
of
billiards
i
am
sick
of
and
i
should
like
to
take
the
next
train
home
again
i
must
dress
for
dinner
now
and
i
finish
this
paul
dressed
for
dinner
his
temper
was
vile
and
his
valet
trembled
then
he
went
down
into
the
restaurant
scowling
and
was
ungracious
to
the
polite
and
conciliating
waiters
ordering
his
food
and
a
bottle
of
claret
as
if
they
had
done
him
an
injury
they
said
to
one
another
behind
the
pointing
their
thumbs
at
him
he
pay
but
he
damn
then
paul
sent
for
the
york
and
propped
it
up
in
front
of
him
prodding
at
some
olives
with
his
fork
one
occasionally
reaching
his
mouth
while
he
read
and
awaited
his
soup
the
table
next
to
him
in
this
quiet
corner
was
laid
for
one
and
had
a
bunch
of
roses
in
the
centre
just
two
or
three
exquisite
blooms
that
he
was
familiar
with
the
appearance
of
in
the
paris
shops
nearly
all
the
other
tables
were
empty
or
emptying
he
had
dined
very
late
who
could
want
roses
eating
alone
the
too
was
written
out
and
ready
and
an
expression
of
expectancy
lightened
the
face
of
the
head
waiter
who
himself
brought
a
bottle
of
most
carefully
decanted
red
wine
feeling
the
temperature
through
the
fine
glass
with
the
air
of
a
great
connoisseur
one
of
those
foreign
brutes
of
no
sex
i
suppose
paul
said
to
himself
and
turned
to
the
sporting
notes
in
front
of
him
he
did
not
look
up
again
until
he
heard
the
rustle
of
a
dress
the
woman
had
to
pass
him
even
so
close
that
the
heavy
silk
touched
his
foot
he
fancied
he
smelt
tuberoses
but
it
was
not
until
she
sat
down
and
he
again
looked
at
her
that
he
perceived
a
knot
of
them
tucked
into
the
front
of
her
bodice
a
woman
to
order
dinner
for
herself
beforehand
and
have
special
wine
and
special
roses
special
attention
too
it
was
simply
disgusting
paul
frowned
he
brought
his
brown
eyebrows
close
together
and
glared
at
the
creature
with
his
blue
young
eyes
an
elderly
dignified
servant
in
black
livery
stood
behind
her
chair
she
herself
was
all
in
black
and
her
hat
an
expensive
hat
cast
a
shadow
over
her
eyes
he
could
just
see
they
were
cast
down
on
her
plate
her
face
was
white
he
saw
that
plainly
enough
startlingly
white
like
a
magnolia
bloom
and
contained
no
marked
features
no
features
at
all
he
said
to
himself
yes
he
was
wrong
she
had
certainly
a
mouth
worth
looking
at
again
it
was
so
red
not
large
and
pink
and
laughingly
open
like
isabella
but
straight
and
chiselled
and
red
red
red
paul
was
young
but
he
knew
paint
when
he
saw
it
and
this
red
was
real
and
vivid
and
disconcerted
him
he
began
his
soup
hers
came
at
the
same
time
she
had
only
toyed
with
some
caviare
by
way
of
and
it
angered
him
to
notice
the
obsequiousness
of
the
waiters
who
passed
each
thing
to
the
dignified
servant
to
be
placed
before
the
lady
by
his
hand
who
was
she
to
be
served
with
this
respect
and
rapidity
only
her
red
wine
the
poured
into
her
glass
himself
she
lifted
it
up
to
the
light
to
see
the
clear
ruby
then
she
sipped
it
and
scented
its
bouquet
the
anxiously
awaiting
her
verdict
the
while
was
all
she
said
and
the
weight
of
the
world
seemed
to
fall
from
the
man
sloping
shoulders
as
he
bowed
and
moved
aside
paul
irritation
grew
she
well
over
thirty
he
said
to
himself
i
suppose
she
has
nothing
else
to
live
for
i
wonder
what
the
devil
she
eat
next
she
ate
a
delicate
but
she
did
not
touch
her
wine
again
the
while
she
had
almost
finished
the
fish
before
au
vin
arrived
upon
the
scene
and
this
angered
him
the
more
why
should
he
wait
for
his
dinner
while
this
woman
feasted
why
indeed
what
would
her
next
course
be
he
found
himself
unpleasantly
interested
to
know
the
tenderest
au
and
the
youngest
green
peas
made
their
appearance
and
again
the
returned
having
mixed
the
salad
paul
noticed
with
all
these
things
the
lady
ate
but
a
small
portion
of
each
and
it
was
not
until
a
fat
quail
arrived
later
while
he
himself
was
trying
to
get
through
two
mutton
chops
that
she
again
tasted
her
claret
yes
it
was
claret
he
felt
sure
and
probably
wonderful
claret
at
that
confound
her
paul
turned
to
the
wine
list
what
could
it
be
château
latour
at
fifteen
francs
château
margaux
or
château
lafite
at
twenty
or
possibly
it
was
not
here
at
all
and
was
special
too
like
the
roses
and
the
attention
he
called
his
waiter
and
ordered
some
port
he
felt
he
could
not
drink
another
drop
of
his
modest
estèphe
all
this
time
the
lady
had
never
once
looked
at
him
indeed
except
that
one
occasion
when
she
had
lifted
her
head
to
examine
the
wine
with
the
light
through
it
he
had
not
seen
her
raise
her
eyes
and
then
the
glass
had
been
between
himself
and
her
the
white
lids
with
their
heavy
lashes
began
to
irritate
him
what
colour
could
they
be
those
eyes
underneath
they
were
not
very
large
that
was
certain
probably
black
too
like
her
hair
little
black
eyes
that
was
ugly
enough
surely
and
he
hated
heavy
black
hair
growing
in
those
unusual
great
waves
women
hair
should
be
light
and
fluffy
and
fuzzy
and
kept
tidy
in
a
net
like
isabella
this
looked
so
thick
enough
to
strangle
one
if
she
twisted
it
round
throat
what
strange
ideas
were
those
coming
into
his
head
why
should
she
think
of
twisting
her
hair
round
a
man
throat
it
must
be
the
port
mounting
to
his
brain
he
decided
he
was
not
given
to
speculating
in
this
way
about
women
what
would
she
eat
next
and
why
did
it
interest
him
what
she
ate
or
did
not
eat
the
again
appeared
with
a
dish
of
nectarines
the
waiter
now
handed
the
dignified
servant
the
into
which
he
poured
paul
could
just
distinguish
the
scent
of
it
and
then
he
noticed
the
hands
yes
they
at
least
were
faultless
he
could
not
cavil
at
slender
and
white
with
that
transparent
whiteness
like
and
what
pink
nails
and
how
polished
hands
but
he
refused
to
think
of
them
by
this
time
he
was
conscious
of
an
absorbing
interest
thrilling
his
whole
being
disapproving
irritated
interest
the
now
removed
the
claret
out
of
which
the
lady
had
only
drunk
one
glass
what
waste
thought
paul
and
then
he
returned
with
a
bottle
and
this
time
the
dignified
servant
poured
the
brilliant
golden
fluid
into
a
tiny
what
could
it
be
paul
was
familiar
with
most
liqueurs
had
he
not
dined
at
every
restaurant
in
london
and
supped
with
houris
who
adored
de
but
this
was
none
he
knew
he
had
heard
of
tokay
imperial
tokay
could
it
be
that
and
where
did
she
get
it
and
who
the
devil
was
the
woman
anyway
she
peeled
the
nectarine
leisurely
she
seemed
to
enjoy
it
more
than
all
the
rest
of
her
dinner
and
what
could
that
expression
mean
on
her
face
inscrutable
cynical
was
it
no
absorbed
as
absolutely
unconscious
of
self
and
others
as
if
she
had
been
alone
in
the
room
what
could
she
be
thinking
of
never
to
worry
to
look
about
her
he
began
now
to
notice
her
throat
it
was
rounded
and
intensely
white
through
the
transparent
black
stuff
she
had
no
strings
of
pearls
or
jewels
on
unless
yes
that
was
a
great
sapphire
gleaming
from
the
folds
of
gauze
on
her
neck
not
surrounded
by
diamonds
like
ordinary
brooches
but
just
a
big
single
stone
so
dark
and
splendid
it
seemed
almost
black
there
was
another
on
her
hand
and
yet
others
in
her
ears
her
ears
were
not
anything
so
very
wonderful
not
so
isabella
were
quite
as
good
and
this
thought
comforted
him
a
little
as
far
as
he
could
see
beyond
the
roses
and
the
table
she
was
a
slender
woman
and
he
had
not
noticed
on
her
entrance
if
she
were
tall
or
short
he
could
not
say
why
he
felt
she
must
be
well
over
thirty
there
was
not
a
line
or
wrinkle
on
her
face
not
even
the
slight
nip
in
under
the
chin
or
the
strain
beside
the
ears
she
was
certainly
not
pretty
not
well
shaped
yes
and
graceful
as
far
as
he
could
judge
but
pretty
a
thousand
times
no
then
the
speculation
as
to
her
nationality
began
french
assuredly
not
english
ridiculous
equally
so
german
italian
perhaps
russian
possibly
hungarian
probably
paul
had
drunk
his
third
glass
of
port
and
was
beginning
his
fourth
this
was
far
more
than
his
usual
limit
paul
was
as
a
rule
an
abstemious
young
man
why
he
should
have
deliberately
sat
and
drank
that
night
he
never
knew
his
dinner
had
been
moderate
distinctly
moderate
and
he
had
watched
a
refined
feast
of
lucullus
partaken
of
by
a
woman
who
only
each
i
wonder
what
she
will
have
to
pay
for
it
all
he
thought
to
himself
she
will
probably
sign
the
bill
though
and
i
sha
see
but
when
the
lady
had
finished
her
nectarine
and
dipped
her
slender
fingers
in
the
she
got
up
she
had
not
smoked
she
could
not
be
russian
then
got
up
and
walked
towards
the
door
signing
no
bill
and
paying
no
gold
paul
stared
as
she
passed
him
rudely
stared
he
knew
it
afterwards
and
felt
ashamed
however
the
lady
never
so
much
as
noticed
him
nor
did
she
raise
her
eyes
so
that
when
she
had
finally
disappeared
he
was
still
unaware
of
their
colour
or
expression
but
what
a
figure
she
had
sinuous
supple
rounded
and
yet
very
slight
she
must
have
the
smallest
possible
bones
paul
said
to
himself
because
it
looks
all
curvy
and
soft
and
yet
she
is
as
slender
as
a
gazelle
she
was
tall
too
though
not
six
feet
like
isabella
the
waiters
and
all
bowed
and
stood
aside
as
she
left
followed
by
her
elderly
stately
servant
of
course
it
would
have
been
an
easy
matter
to
paul
to
find
out
her
name
and
all
about
her
he
would
only
have
had
to
summon
monsieur
jacques
and
ask
any
question
he
pleased
but
for
some
unexplained
reason
he
would
not
do
this
instead
of
which
he
scowled
in
front
of
him
and
finished
his
fourth
glass
of
port
then
his
head
swam
a
little
and
he
went
outside
into
the
night
the
rain
had
stopped
and
the
sky
was
full
of
stars
scattered
in
its
intense
blue
it
was
warm
too
there
under
the
clipped
trees
paul
hoped
he
was
drunk
such
a
beastly
thing
to
do
and
not
even
good
port
either
he
sat
on
a
bench
and
smoked
a
cigar
a
strange
sense
of
loneliness
came
over
him
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
far
far
away
from
any
one
in
the
world
he
had
ever
known
a
vague
feeling
of
oppression
and
coming
calamity
passed
through
him
only
he
was
really
as
yet
too
material
and
thoroughly
solidly
english
to
entertain
it
or
any
other
subtle
mental
emotion
for
more
than
a
minute
but
he
undoubtedly
felt
strange
different
from
what
he
had
ever
done
before
he
would
have
said
weird
if
he
could
have
thought
of
the
word
the
woman
and
her
sinuous
sensuous
black
shape
filled
the
space
of
his
mental
vision
black
hair
black
hat
black
dress
and
of
course
black
eyes
ah
if
he
could
only
know
their
colour
really
the
damp
bench
where
he
sat
was
just
under
the
ivy
hanging
from
the
balustrade
of
the
small
terrace
belonging
to
the
suite
at
the
end
there
was
a
silence
very
few
people
passed
frightened
no
doubt
by
the
recent
rain
he
seemed
alone
in
the
world
the
wine
now
began
to
fire
his
senses
why
should
he
remain
alone
he
was
young
and
rich
and
surely
even
in
lucerne
there
must
be
and
then
he
felt
a
beast
and
looked
out
on
to
the
lake
suddenly
his
heart
seemed
to
swell
with
some
emotion
a
faint
scent
of
tuberoses
filled
the
air
and
from
exactly
above
his
head
there
came
a
gentle
tender
sigh
he
started
violently
and
brusquely
turned
and
looked
up
almost
indistinguishable
in
the
deep
shadow
he
saw
the
woman
face
it
seemed
to
emerge
from
a
mist
of
black
gauze
and
looking
down
into
his
were
a
pair
of
eyes
a
pair
of
eyes
for
a
moment
paul
heart
felt
as
if
it
had
stopped
beating
so
wonderful
was
their
effect
upon
him
they
seemed
to
draw
him
draw
something
out
of
him
intoxicate
him
paralyse
him
and
as
he
gazed
up
motionless
the
woman
moved
noiselessly
back
on
to
the
terrace
and
he
saw
nothing
but
the
night
sky
studded
with
stars
had
he
been
dreaming
had
she
really
bent
over
the
ivy
was
he
mad
yes
or
drunk
because
now
he
had
seen
the
eyes
and
yet
he
did
not
know
their
colour
were
they
black
or
blue
or
grey
or
green
he
did
not
know
he
could
not
think
only
they
were
eyes
eyes
eyes
the
letter
to
isabella
waring
remained
unfinished
that
night
chapter
ii
paul
head
ached
a
good
deal
next
morning
and
he
was
disinclined
to
rise
however
the
sun
blazed
in
at
his
windows
and
a
bird
sang
in
a
tree
his
temper
was
the
temper
of
next
day
sodden
and
sullen
and
ashamed
he
even
resented
the
sunshine
but
what
a
beautiful
creature
he
looked
as
later
he
stepped
into
a
boat
for
a
row
on
the
lake
his
mother
the
lady
henrietta
had
truly
reason
to
be
proud
of
him
so
tall
and
straight
and
fair
and
strong
and
at
the
risk
of
causing
a
second
fit
among
some
of
the
critics
i
must
add
he
probably
wore
silk
socks
and
was
beautifully
groomed
too
as
all
young
englishmen
are
of
his
class
and
age
and
how
supple
his
lithe
body
seemed
as
he
bent
over
the
oars
while
the
boat
shot
out
into
the
blue
water
the
mountains
were
really
very
jolly
he
thought
and
it
was
not
too
hot
and
he
was
glad
he
had
come
out
even
though
he
had
eaten
no
breakfast
and
was
feeling
rather
cheap
still
yes
very
glad
after
he
had
advanced
a
few
hundred
yards
he
rested
on
his
oars
and
looked
up
at
the
hotel
then
wonder
came
back
to
him
where
was
she
the
lady
with
the
eyes
or
had
he
dreamed
it
and
was
there
no
lady
at
all
it
should
not
worry
him
anyway
so
he
rowed
ahead
and
ceased
to
speculate
the
first
thing
he
did
when
he
came
in
for
lunch
was
to
finish
his
letter
to
isabella
monday
he
added
it
is
finer
and
i
have
had
some
exercise
the
view
is
bad
now
the
mist
has
gone
i
shall
do
some
climbing
i
think
take
care
of
yourself
dear
girl
love
from
paul
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
excitement
that
he
entered
the
restaurant
for
would
she
be
there
how
would
she
seem
in
daylight
but
the
little
table
where
she
had
sat
the
night
before
was
unoccupied
there
were
the
usual
cloth
and
glass
and
silver
but
no
preparations
for
any
specially
expected
guest
upon
it
paul
felt
annoyed
with
himself
because
his
heart
sank
had
she
gone
or
did
she
only
dine
in
public
perhaps
she
lunched
in
the
beyond
the
terrace
where
he
had
seen
her
eyes
the
night
before
the
food
was
really
very
good
and
the
sun
shone
and
paul
was
young
and
hungry
so
presently
he
forgot
about
the
lady
and
enjoyed
his
meal
the
appearance
of
the
bürgenstock
across
the
lake
attracted
him
as
afterwards
he
smoked
another
cigar
under
the
trees
he
would
hire
an
electric
launch
and
go
there
and
explore
the
paths
if
only
pike
were
with
him
or
isabella
this
idea
he
put
into
execution
what
a
thing
was
a
funicular
railway
how
steep
and
unpleasant
but
how
quaint
the
looked
when
one
was
up
among
them
yes
lucerne
was
a
good
deal
jollier
than
paris
and
he
roamed
about
among
the
trees
never
noticing
their
beautiful
colours
presently
he
paused
to
rest
he
was
soothed
even
peaceful
if
he
had
pike
he
could
really
be
quite
happy
he
thought
what
was
that
rustle
among
the
leaves
above
him
he
looked
up
and
started
then
as
violently
almost
as
he
had
done
the
night
before
because
there
peeping
at
him
from
the
tender
green
of
the
young
beeches
was
the
lady
in
black
she
looked
down
upon
him
through
the
parted
boughs
her
black
hat
and
long
black
veil
making
a
sharp
silhouette
against
the
vivid
verdure
her
whole
face
in
tender
shadow
and
framed
in
the
misty
gauze
paul
heart
beat
violently
he
felt
a
pulse
in
his
throat
for
a
few
seconds
he
knew
he
was
gazing
into
her
eyes
and
he
thought
he
knew
they
were
green
they
looked
larger
than
he
had
imagined
them
to
be
they
were
set
so
beautifully
too
just
a
suspicion
of
rise
at
the
corners
and
their
expression
was
mocking
and
compelling
and
but
she
let
go
the
branches
and
disappeared
from
view
paul
stood
still
he
was
thrilling
all
over
should
he
bound
in
among
the
trees
and
follow
her
should
he
call
out
and
ask
her
to
come
back
should
he
but
when
he
had
decided
and
gained
the
spot
where
she
must
have
stood
he
saw
it
was
a
junction
of
three
paths
and
he
was
in
perfect
ignorance
which
one
she
had
taken
he
rushed
down
the
first
of
them
but
it
twisted
and
turned
and
when
he
had
gone
far
enough
to
see
ahead
there
was
no
one
in
sight
so
he
retraced
his
steps
and
tried
the
second
this
too
ended
in
disappointment
and
the
third
led
to
an
opening
where
he
could
see
the
descending
and
just
as
it
sank
out
of
view
he
caught
sight
of
a
black
dress
almost
hidden
by
a
standing
man
figure
whom
he
recognised
as
the
elderly
servant
paul
had
learnt
a
number
of
at
eton
and
oxford
and
he
let
the
trees
hear
most
of
them
then
he
could
not
get
down
himself
until
the
train
returned
and
by
that
time
where
would
she
be
to
go
by
the
paths
would
take
an
eternity
this
time
circumstance
had
fairly
done
him
presently
he
sauntered
back
to
the
little
hotel
whose
terrace
commands
the
lake
far
below
and
eagerly
watching
the
craft
upon
it
he
thought
he
caught
sight
of
a
black
figure
reclining
in
an
electric
launch
which
sped
over
the
blue
water
then
he
began
to
reason
with
himself
why
should
the
sight
of
this
woman
have
caused
him
such
violent
emotion
why
women
were
jolly
things
that
did
not
matter
much
except
isabella
she
mattered
of
course
but
somehow
her
mental
picture
came
less
readily
to
his
mind
than
usual
the
things
he
seemed
to
see
most
distinctly
were
her
hands
her
big
red
hands
and
then
he
unconsciously
drifted
from
all
thought
of
her
she
certainly
looks
younger
in
daylight
he
said
to
himself
not
more
than
thirty
perhaps
and
what
strange
hats
with
that
shadow
over
her
eyes
what
is
she
doing
here
all
alone
she
must
be
somebody
from
the
people
in
the
hotel
making
such
a
fuss
and
that
servant
then
why
alone
he
mused
and
mused
she
was
not
a
the
english
ones
he
knew
were
very
ordinary
people
but
he
had
heard
of
some
of
the
french
ladies
as
being
quite
and
travelling
yet
he
was
convinced
this
was
not
one
of
them
who
she
be
he
must
know
to
go
back
to
the
hotel
would
be
the
shortest
way
to
find
out
and
so
by
the
next
descending
train
he
left
the
bürgenstock
he
walked
up
and
down
under
the
outside
the
terrace
of
her
rooms
for
half
an
hour
but
was
not
rewarded
in
any
way
for
his
pains
and
at
last
he
went
in
he
too
would
have
a
dinner
worth
eating
he
thought
so
he
consulted
the
on
his
way
up
to
dress
and
together
they
evolved
a
banquet
paul
longed
to
question
the
man
about
the
unknown
but
as
yet
he
was
no
actor
and
he
found
he
felt
too
much
about
it
to
do
it
naturally
he
dressed
with
the
greatest
care
and
descended
at
exactly
eight
yes
the
table
was
laid
for
her
evidently
but
there
were
giant
carnations
not
roses
in
the
silver
vase
how
quickly
the
waiters
seemed
to
bring
things
and
what
a
frightful
lot
there
was
to
eat
and
dawdle
as
he
would
by
nine
he
had
almost
finished
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
to
send
for
a
newspaper
again
anything
to
delay
his
having
to
rise
and
go
out
an
anxious
uncomfortable
gnawing
sense
of
expectancy
dominated
him
how
ridiculous
for
a
woman
to
be
so
late
what
cook
could
do
justice
to
his
dishes
if
they
were
thus
to
be
kept
waiting
she
could
possibly
have
it
for
half
past
nine
surely
gradually
as
that
hour
passed
and
his
second
cup
of
coffee
had
been
sipped
to
its
finish
paul
felt
a
sickening
sense
of
anger
and
disappointment
he
got
up
abruptly
and
went
out
in
the
hall
coming
from
the
corridor
of
her
rooms
he
met
the
lady
face
to
face
then
rage
with
himself
seized
him
why
had
he
not
waited
for
no
possible
reason
could
he
go
back
now
and
what
a
chance
to
look
at
her
missed
and
all
thrown
away
he
sat
sullenly
down
in
the
hall
resisting
the
temptation
to
go
into
the
beautiful
night
at
least
he
would
see
her
on
her
way
back
but
he
waited
until
nearly
eleven
and
she
never
appeared
and
then
the
maddening
thought
came
to
him
she
had
probably
passed
to
her
rooms
along
the
terrace
outside
under
the
he
bounded
up
and
stalked
into
the
starlight
he
could
see
through
the
windows
of
the
restaurant
and
no
one
was
there
then
he
sat
on
the
bench
again
under
the
ivy
but
all
was
darkness
and
silence
and
thoroughly
depressed
paul
at
last
went
to
bed
next
day
was
so
gloriously
fine
that
youth
and
health
sang
within
him
he
was
up
and
away
quite
early
not
a
thought
of
this
strange
lady
should
cross
his
mind
for
the
entire
day
he
determined
as
he
ate
his
breakfast
and
soon
he
started
for
the
rigi
in
a
launch
taking
the
english
papers
with
him
intense
joy
too
a
letter
from
isabella
such
a
nice
letter
all
about
pike
and
moonlighter
and
the
other
horses
and
isabella
was
going
to
stay
with
a
friend
at
blackheath
where
she
hoped
to
get
better
golf
than
at
home
and
lady
henrietta
had
been
gracious
to
her
and
given
her
paul
address
and
there
had
been
a
jolly
big
party
at
verdayne
place
for
sunday
but
none
of
his
pals
at
least
if
there
were
they
were
not
in
church
she
added
naïvely
all
this
paul
read
in
his
launch
on
the
way
to
the
rigi
and
for
some
unexplained
reason
the
information
seemed
about
things
a
long
way
off
and
less
thrilling
than
usual
he
had
a
splendid
climb
and
when
he
got
back
to
lucerne
in
the
evening
he
was
thoroughly
tired
and
so
hungry
he
flew
down
to
his
dinner
it
was
nearly
nine
at
least
if
she
came
he
would
be
there
to
see
her
but
of
course
it
did
not
matter
if
she
came
or
not
he
had
conquered
that
ridiculous
interest
he
would
hardly
look
until
he
reached
his
table
yes
there
she
was
but
dipping
her
white
fingers
in
the
rosewater
at
the
very
end
of
her
repast
and
again
in
spite
of
himself
a
strange
wild
thrill
ran
through
paul
and
he
knew
it
was
what
he
had
been
subconsciously
hoping
for
all
day
and
oh
alas
it
mattered
exceedingly
the
lady
never
glanced
at
him
she
swept
from
the
room
her
stately
graceful
movements
delighting
his
eye
he
could
understand
and
appreciate
movement
was
he
not
accustomed
to
thoroughbreds
and
able
to
judge
of
their
action
and
line
how
blank
the
space
seemed
when
she
had
gone
dull
and
unspeakably
uninteresting
he
became
impatient
with
the
slowness
of
the
waiters
who
had
seemed
to
hurry
unnecessarily
the
night
before
but
at
last
his
meal
ended
and
he
went
out
under
the
trees
the
sky
was
so
full
of
stars
it
hardly
seemed
dark
the
air
was
soft
and
in
the
distance
a
band
played
a
plaintive
valse
tune
there
were
numbers
of
people
walking
about
and
the
lights
from
the
hotel
windows
lit
up
the
scene
only
the
ivy
terrace
was
in
shadow
as
he
again
sat
down
on
the
bench
how
had
she
got
in
last
night
that
he
must
find
out
he
rose
and
peered
about
him
yes
there
was
a
little
gate
a
flight
of
steps
a
private
entrance
into
this
suite
just
round
the
corner
and
as
he
looked
at
it
the
lady
wrapped
in
a
scarf
of
black
gauze
passed
him
and
standing
aside
while
the
servant
opened
the
little
door
with
a
key
she
then
entered
and
disappeared
from
view
it
seemed
as
if
the
stars
danced
to
paul
his
whole
being
was
quivering
with
excitement
and
now
he
sat
on
the
bench
again
almost
trembling
he
did
not
move
for
at
least
half
an
hour
then
the
clocks
chimed
in
the
town
no
there
was
no
hope
he
would
see
her
no
more
that
night
he
rose
listlessly
to
go
back
to
bed
tired
out
with
his
climb
and
as
he
stood
up
there
above
the
ivy
again
he
saw
her
face
looking
down
upon
him
how
had
she
crossed
the
terrace
without
his
hearing
her
how
long
had
she
been
there
but
what
matter
at
least
she
was
there
and
those
eyes
looking
into
his
out
of
the
shadow
what
did
they
say
surely
they
smiled
at
him
paul
jumped
on
to
the
bench
now
he
was
almost
level
with
her
face
almost
and
his
was
raised
eagerly
in
expectation
was
he
dreaming
or
did
she
whisper
something
the
sound
was
so
soft
he
was
not
quite
sure
he
stretched
out
his
arms
to
her
in
the
darkness
pulling
himself
by
the
ivy
nearer
still
and
this
time
there
was
no
mistake
come
paul
she
said
i
have
some
words
to
say
to
you
and
round
to
the
little
gate
paul
flew
chapter
iii
paul
was
never
quite
sure
of
what
happened
that
evening
everything
was
so
wonderful
so
unusual
so
unlike
his
ordinary
life
the
gate
was
unlocked
he
found
when
he
got
there
but
no
one
appeared
to
be
inside
and
he
bounded
up
the
steps
and
on
to
the
terrace
silence
and
darkness
was
she
fooling
him
then
no
there
she
was
by
one
of
the
windows
he
could
dimly
see
her
outline
as
she
passed
into
the
room
beyond
through
some
heavy
curtains
that
was
why
no
light
came
through
to
the
terrace
he
followed
dropping
them
after
him
also
and
then
he
found
himself
in
a
room
as
unlike
a
hotel
as
he
could
imagine
it
may
have
had
the
usual
brocade
walls
and
gilt
chairs
of
the
best
suite
but
its
aspect
was
so
transformed
by
her
subtle
taste
and
presence
it
seemed
to
him
unique
and
there
were
masses
of
flowers
roses
big
white
ones
tuberoses
lilies
of
the
valley
gardenias
late
violets
the
light
were
low
and
shaded
and
a
great
couch
filled
one
side
of
the
room
beyond
the
fireplace
such
a
couch
covered
with
a
and
piled
with
pillows
all
shades
of
rich
purple
velvet
and
silk
embroidered
with
silver
and
gold
unlike
any
pillows
he
had
ever
seen
before
even
to
their
shapes
the
whole
thing
was
different
and
strange
and
intoxicating
the
lady
had
reached
the
couch
and
sank
into
it
she
was
in
black
still
but
gauzy
clinging
black
which
seemed
to
give
some
gleam
of
purple
underneath
and
if
he
had
not
been
sure
that
in
daylight
he
had
thought
they
were
green
he
would
have
sworn
the
eyes
which
now
looked
into
his
were
deepest
violet
too
come
she
said
you
may
sit
here
beside
me
and
tell
me
what
you
think
and
her
voice
was
like
rich
music
but
she
had
hardly
any
accent
she
might
have
been
an
englishwoman
almost
for
that
matter
and
yet
he
somehow
knew
that
she
was
not
perhaps
it
was
she
pronounced
each
word
nothing
was
slurred
over
without
her
hat
she
looked
even
more
attractive
and
certainly
younger
but
what
was
age
or
youth
and
what
was
beauty
itself
when
a
woman
whose
face
was
neither
young
nor
beautiful
could
make
him
feel
he
was
looking
at
a
divine
goddess
and
thrilling
as
he
had
never
dreamt
of
doing
in
his
short
life
if
any
one
had
told
paul
this
was
going
to
happen
to
him
this
experience
he
would
have
laughed
them
to
scorn
to
begin
with
he
was
rather
shy
with
ladies
as
a
rule
and
had
not
learnt
a
trick
of
it
took
him
quite
a
while
to
know
one
well
enough
to
even
talk
at
ease
and
yet
here
he
was
embarked
upon
an
adventure
which
savoured
of
the
arabian
nights
he
came
forward
and
sat
down
and
he
could
feel
the
pulse
beating
in
his
throat
it
all
seemed
perfectly
natural
at
the
time
but
afterwards
he
wondered
how
she
had
known
his
name
was
paul
and
how
it
had
all
come
to
pass
for
three
days
you
have
thought
of
me
paul
is
it
not
so
she
said
half
closing
her
lids
but
he
could
only
blurt
out
yes
while
he
devoured
her
with
his
eyes
we
are
both
how
shall
i
say
drifting
trying
to
forget
and
we
must
talk
a
little
together
tell
me
oh
yes
said
paul
you
are
beautiful
you
know
paul
she
went
on
so
tall
and
straight
like
you
english
with
curly
hair
of
gold
your
mother
must
have
loved
you
as
a
baby
i
suppose
she
did
said
paul
she
is
well
your
mother
the
stately
lady
very
well
do
you
know
her
he
asked
surprised
long
ago
i
have
seen
her
and
i
knew
you
at
once
so
like
you
are
and
to
your
uncles
especially
the
lord
hubert
uncle
hubert
is
a
rotter
a
rotter
inquired
the
lady
and
what
is
that
and
she
smiled
a
divine
smile
paul
felt
ashamed
oh
well
it
a
rotter
you
know
that
like
uncle
hubert
i
mean
she
laughed
again
you
do
not
explain
well
but
i
understand
you
and
so
you
only
resemble
the
uncle
hubert
on
the
outside
that
is
good
paul
felt
jealous
lord
hubert
aldringham
reputation
for
some
things
was
european
i
hope
so
he
said
with
emphasis
and
you
knew
him
well
then
too
i
never
said
so
replied
the
lady
i
saw
him
once
twice
perhaps
years
ago
at
the
marriage
of
a
princess
there
it
has
made
you
frown
we
will
speak
no
more
of
the
uncle
hubert
and
she
leant
back
and
laughed
paul
felt
very
young
he
wanted
to
show
her
he
was
grown
up
and
he
wanted
a
number
of
things
which
had
never
even
formed
themselves
in
his
imagination
before
but
she
went
on
talking
and
your
were
tough
paul
and
you
were
so
cross
that
first
evening
and
hated
me
and
oh
paul
you
had
far
too
much
wine
for
a
boy
like
you
he
reddened
to
the
roots
of
his
fair
wavy
hair
and
then
he
hung
his
head
i
know
i
did
it
was
beastly
of
me
but
i
was
so
upset
i
look
at
me
she
said
and
she
bent
forward
over
him
a
gliding
feline
movement
infinitely
sinuous
and
attractive
then
he
looked
his
big
blue
eyes
still
cloudy
with
a
mist
of
shame
you
must
tell
me
why
you
were
upset
baby
paul
how
often
she
said
his
name
lingering
over
it
as
if
it
were
music
it
thrilled
him
every
time
then
he
gained
courage
but
how
did
you
know
anything
about
it
or
what
i
had
or
what
i
drank
you
never
once
raised
your
eyelids
all
the
time
perhaps
i
can
see
through
them
when
i
want
to
who
knows
and
she
laughed
and
you
wanted
to
wanted
to
see
through
them
he
was
gazing
at
her
now
and
she
suddenly
looked
down
while
the
most
beautiful
transparent
pink
flushed
her
soft
white
cheeks
turning
her
into
a
tender
girl
almost
the
change
was
so
sudden
it
startled
paul
and
emboldened
him
you
wanted
to
he
repeated
in
a
glad
voice
you
wanted
to
see
me
yes
she
whispered
and
she
looked
up
at
him
but
this
time
there
was
mischief
in
her
eyes
is
that
why
you
sighed
then
among
the
ivy
what
made
you
sigh
she
paused
a
moment
and
then
she
said
slowly
a
number
of
things
you
seemed
so
young
and
so
beautiful
and
so
asleep
indeed
i
was
asleep
paul
exclaimed
it
would
take
a
great
deal
more
port
than
that
to
make
me
go
to
sleep
i
was
thinking
of
and
then
he
saw
she
had
not
meant
that
kind
of
sleep
and
felt
a
fool
and
wondered
she
helped
him
out
all
this
time
you
have
not
told
me
why
you
were
upset
upset
enough
to
drink
bad
port
that
was
naughty
of
you
paul
i
was
upset
over
you
i
was
angry
because
i
was
so
interested
and
he
reddened
again
she
leant
back
among
the
purple
cushions
her
figure
so
supple
in
its
lines
it
made
him
think
of
a
snake
she
half
closed
her
eyes
again
and
she
spoke
low
in
a
dreamy
voice
it
was
fate
paul
i
knew
it
when
i
entered
the
room
i
felt
it
again
among
the
green
trees
and
so
i
ran
from
you
but
it
is
fort
que
so
i
called
you
to
come
in
i
am
so
glad
so
said
paul
she
remained
silent
her
eyes
in
their
narrowed
lids
gleamed
at
him
seeming
to
penetrate
into
his
very
soul
and
now
he
noticed
her
mouth
again
it
neither
drooped
nor
smiled
it
was
straight
and
chiselled
and
strong
and
small
rather
and
the
lower
lip
was
rounded
and
slightly
cleft
in
the
centre
a
most
appetising
red
flower
of
a
mouth
by
this
time
paul
was
more
or
less
intoxicated
with
excitement
he
had
lost
all
sense
of
time
and
place
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
known
her
always
that
there
never
had
been
a
moment
when
she
had
not
filled
the
whole
of
his
horizon
they
were
both
silent
for
a
couple
of
minutes
as
far
as
he
could
gather
from
her
inscrutable
face
she
was
weighing
things
what
things
suddenly
she
sprang
up
one
of
those
fine
movements
of
hers
full
of
grace
paul
she
said
listen
and
she
spoke
rather
fast
you
are
so
young
so
young
and
i
shall
hurt
you
probably
wo
you
go
now
while
there
is
yet
time
away
from
lucerne
back
to
paris
even
back
to
england
anywhere
away
from
me
she
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
looked
up
into
his
eyes
and
there
were
tears
in
hers
and
now
he
saw
that
they
were
grey
he
was
moved
as
never
yet
in
all
his
life
i
will
not
he
said
i
may
be
young
but
i
know
i
want
to
live
and
i
will
chance
the
hurt
because
i
know
that
only
you
can
teach
me
just
how
then
his
voice
broke
and
he
bent
down
and
covered
her
hand
with
kisses
she
quivered
a
little
and
drew
away
she
picked
up
a
great
bunch
of
tuberoses
and
broke
off
all
their
tops
there
take
them
she
said
pressing
them
into
his
hands
and
those
against
his
heart
take
them
and
go
and
dream
of
me
you
have
chosen
dream
of
me
and
remember
there
is
then
she
glided
back
from
him
and
before
he
realised
it
she
had
gone
noiselessly
away
through
another
door
paul
stood
still
the
room
swam
his
head
swam
then
he
stumbled
out
on
to
the
terrace
under
the
night
sky
the
white
blossoms
still
pressed
against
his
heart
he
must
have
walked
about
for
hours
the
grey
dawn
was
creeping
over
the
silent
world
when
at
last
he
went
back
to
the
hotel
and
to
his
bed
there
he
slept
and
dreamt
never
a
dream
for
youth
and
health
are
glorious
things
and
he
was
tired
out
the
great
sun
was
high
in
the
heavens
when
next
he
awoke
and
the
room
was
full
of
the
scent
of
tuberoses
scattered
on
the
pillow
beside
him
presently
when
his
blue
eyes
began
to
take
in
the
meaning
of
things
he
remembered
and
bounded
up
for
was
not
this
the
commencement
of
his
first
real
day
chapter
iv
the
problem
which
faced
paul
when
he
had
finished
a
very
late
breakfast
was
how
he
should
see
her
soon
the
lady
in
black
he
could
not
go
and
call
like
an
ordinary
visitor
because
he
did
not
know
her
name
that
was
wonderful
did
not
even
know
her
name
or
anything
about
her
only
that
his
whole
being
was
thrilling
with
anxiety
to
see
her
again
the
simplest
thing
to
do
seemed
to
descend
into
the
hall
and
look
at
the
visitors
list
which
he
promptly
did
there
were
only
a
few
people
in
the
hotel
it
was
not
hard
therefore
guessing
at
the
numbers
of
the
rooms
to
arrive
at
the
conviction
that
mme
zalenska
and
suite
might
be
what
he
was
searching
for
zalenska
she
was
possibly
russian
after
all
and
what
was
her
christian
name
that
he
longed
to
know
as
he
stood
staring
his
fair
forehead
puckered
into
a
frown
of
thought
the
servant
came
up
behind
him
and
said
with
his
respectful
dignified
bearing
la
part
de
handing
paul
a
letter
the
while
what
could
it
contain
but
this
was
not
the
moment
for
speculation
he
would
read
and
see
he
turned
his
back
on
the
servant
and
walked
towards
the
light
while
he
tore
open
the
envelope
it
had
the
most
minute
sphinx
in
the
corner
and
the
paper
was
and
rather
thin
this
was
what
he
read
paul
i
am
young
and
we
must
see
the
blue
lake
and
the
green
trees
come
to
the
landing
towards
the
station
and
i
will
call
for
you
in
my
launch
and
you
shall
be
young
too
paul
and
teach
me
give
dmitry
the
answer
the
answer
is
immediately
tell
madame
paul
said
and
then
he
trod
on
air
until
he
arrived
at
the
landing
she
had
indicated
soon
the
launch
glided
up
he
saw
her
there
reclining
under
an
awning
of
striped
green
it
was
a
launch
the
comfortable
were
in
the
bows
and
the
steering
took
place
from
a
raised
perch
behind
the
cabin
so
the
two
were
practically
alone
the
lady
was
in
grey
and
it
suited
her
strangely
her
eyes
gleamed
at
him
full
of
mischief
under
her
large
grey
hat
paul
drew
his
chair
a
little
forward
turning
it
so
that
he
could
look
at
her
without
restraint
how
good
of
you
to
send
for
me
he
said
delightedly
she
smiled
a
radiant
smile
was
it
i
am
capricious
i
did
not
think
of
the
good
for
you
only
i
wanted
you
to
please
myself
i
wish
to
be
foolish
paul
and
see
your
eyes
dance
and
watch
the
light
on
your
curls
paul
frowned
it
was
as
if
she
thought
him
a
baby
then
the
lady
leant
back
and
laughed
the
sound
was
of
golden
bells
yes
you
are
a
baby
she
said
answering
his
thoughts
a
great
big
beautiful
baby
paul
if
paul
had
been
a
girl
he
would
have
pouted
she
turned
from
him
and
gazed
over
the
lake
it
was
looking
indescribably
beautiful
with
the
colours
of
the
springtime
do
you
see
the
green
of
those
beeches
by
the
water
paul
look
at
their
tenderness
next
the
dark
firs
and
then
the
blue
beyond
and
see
there
is
a
copper
beech
he
is
king
of
them
all
i
would
like
to
build
a
châlet
up
in
some
part
like
that
and
come
there
each
year
in
may
to
read
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
paul
saw
with
different
eyes
just
the
beauty
of
things
and
forgot
to
gauge
their
sporting
possibilities
an
infinite
joy
was
flooding
his
being
some
sensation
he
had
not
dreamed
about
even
of
happiness
and
fulfilment
she
appeared
to
him
more
alluring
than
ever
and
young
and
gay
as
young
as
isabella
and
then
his
thoughts
caused
him
to
take
in
his
breath
with
a
hiss
isabella
how
far
away
she
seemed
of
course
he
could
never
love
any
one
else
but
do
think
of
it
then
the
lady
whispered
be
young
like
me
and
live
under
the
blue
sky
how
was
it
she
knew
his
thoughts
always
he
blushed
while
he
stammered
no
i
wo
think
of
it
or
anything
but
you
princess
daring
one
she
said
who
told
you
to
call
me
that
the
hotel
people
have
been
talking
i
suppose
no
said
paul
surprised
i
called
you
princess
just
because
you
seem
like
one
to
me
but
now
i
guess
from
what
you
say
you
are
not
plain
madame
zalenska
her
eyes
clouded
for
a
second
madame
zalenska
does
to
travel
with
but
you
shall
call
me
what
you
like
he
grew
emboldened
i
suddenly
feel
i
want
so
much
i
want
to
know
why
your
eyes
were
so
mocking
through
the
trees
on
the
bürgenstock
they
drove
me
nearly
mad
you
know
and
i
raced
about
after
you
like
a
dog
after
a
hare
i
thought
you
would
you
did
not
control
the
expression
when
you
gazed
up
at
me
and
so
i
was
the
true
hare
and
ran
away
she
looked
down
suddenly
and
was
silent
for
some
moments
then
she
turned
the
conversation
from
these
personal
things
she
led
his
thoughts
into
new
channels
made
him
observe
the
trees
and
sky
and
the
wonderful
beauty
of
it
all
and
with
lightning
flashes
took
him
into
unknown
speculations
on
emotions
and
the
meaning
of
things
a
new
existence
seemed
to
open
to
paul
view
and
all
the
while
she
lay
back
in
her
chair
almost
motionless
only
her
wonderful
eyes
lit
up
the
strange
whiteness
of
her
face
there
was
not
a
touch
of
or
explanation
of
the
unusualness
of
this
situation
in
her
manner
it
had
a
perfect
quiet
dignity
as
if
to
look
into
the
eyes
of
an
unknown
young
man
at
night
over
an
ivy
terrace
and
then
spend
a
day
with
him
alone
were
the
most
natural
things
in
the
world
to
do
paul
felt
she
was
a
queen
whose
actions
must
be
left
unquestioned
presently
they
came
to
a
small
village
and
here
she
would
land
and
lunch
and
from
somewhere
behind
the
cabin
dmitry
appeared
and
was
sent
on
ahead
so
that
when
they
walked
into
the
little
hotel
a
simple
repast
was
waiting
for
them
by
this
time
paul
was
absolutely
enthralled
never
in
his
whole
life
had
he
spent
such
a
morning
his
imagination
was
expanded
he
saw
new
vistas
his
brain
almost
whirled
was
it
he
paul
verdayne
who
was
seated
opposite
this
divine
woman
drinking
in
her
voice
and
listening
to
her
subtle
curious
thoughts
and
what
were
the
commonplace
ordinary
things
which
had
hitherto
occupied
his
mind
how
had
he
ever
wasted
a
moment
on
them
it
was
his
first
awakening
when
it
came
to
the
end
this
delightful
repast
he
called
the
waiter
and
wanted
to
pay
the
bill
small
enough
in
all
conscience
but
a
new
look
appeared
round
the
lady
mouth
imperious
with
an
instantaneous
flash
in
her
eyes
a
pure
they
were
leave
it
to
dmitry
she
said
quickly
i
never
occupy
myself
with
money
they
displease
me
these
details
and
why
spoil
my
day
but
paul
was
an
englishman
and
resented
any
woman
paying
for
his
food
his
mouth
changed
too
and
looked
obstinate
i
say
you
know
he
began
then
she
turned
upon
him
understand
at
once
she
said
haughtily
either
you
leave
me
unjarred
by
your
english
conventionalities
or
you
pay
these
miserable
francs
and
go
back
to
lucerne
alone
paul
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
was
angry
but
could
not
insist
further
when
they
got
outside
her
voice
grew
caressing
again
as
she
led
the
way
to
a
path
up
among
the
young
beeches
paul
foolish
one
she
said
do
you
not
think
i
understand
and
know
you
and
your
quaint
english
ways
but
imagine
how
silly
it
is
i
am
quite
aware
that
you
have
ample
money
to
provide
me
with
a
feast
of
midas
all
of
gold
if
necessary
and
you
shall
some
day
if
you
really
wish
but
to
stop
over
paltry
sums
of
francs
to
destroy
the
thread
of
our
conversation
and
thoughts
to
make
it
all
banal
and
everyday
that
is
what
i
wo
have
dmitry
is
there
for
nothing
else
but
to
for
me
these
details
it
is
my
holiday
my
my
time
of
joy
i
felt
young
paul
you
would
not
make
one
little
shadow
for
me
would
you
no
voice
that
he
had
ever
dreamt
of
possessed
so
many
tones
in
it
as
hers
even
one
of
pathos
as
she
lingered
over
the
word
shadow
all
his
annoyance
melted
he
only
felt
he
would
change
the
very
mainspring
of
his
life
if
necessary
to
give
her
pleasure
and
joy
of
course
i
would
not
make
a
shadow
surely
you
know
that
he
said
moved
only
you
see
a
man
generally
pays
for
a
woman
food
when
she
belongs
to
him
but
i
do
belong
to
you
baby
paul
you
for
the
day
belong
to
me
and
are
my
guest
very
well
then
we
wo
talk
about
it
he
said
resigned
by
the
caress
in
her
words
to
belong
to
her
that
was
something
if
but
for
one
day
only
it
must
never
come
up
again
this
question
she
insisted
should
we
spend
more
hours
on
this
lake
or
other
lakes
or
mountains
or
rivers
or
towns
let
us
speak
never
of
money
or
paying
if
you
only
knew
of
how
i
hate
it
the
cruel
yellow
gold
i
have
heaps
of
it
heaps
of
it
and
for
it
human
beings
have
always
paid
so
great
a
price
just
this
once
in
life
let
it
bring
happiness
and
peace
he
wondered
at
the
concentrated
feeling
she
expressed
what
could
the
price
be
and
what
was
her
history
so
it
is
over
our
little
breeze
she
said
gently
after
a
pause
and
you
will
tease
me
no
more
paul
i
would
never
tease
you
he
exclaimed
tenderly
and
if
he
had
dared
he
would
have
taken
her
hand
you
english
are
so
wonderful
full
of
your
prejudices
she
said
in
a
contemplative
way
bulldog
tenacity
of
purpose
whether
you
are
right
or
wrong
things
are
a
custom
and
they
must
be
done
or
it
is
not
the
game
and
she
imitated
a
set
english
voice
her
beautiful
mouth
pursed
up
until
paul
had
to
use
violent
restraint
with
himself
to
keep
from
kissing
it
a
wonderful
people
mostly
gentlemen
and
generally
honest
but
of
a
common
sense
that
is
disastrous
to
sentiment
or
romance
if
you
were
not
so
polished
and
lazy
and
strong
and
beautiful
to
look
at
one
would
not
consider
you
much
beyond
the
german
not
consider
us
beyond
a
beastly
german
exclaimed
paul
indignantly
and
the
lady
laughed
like
a
child
oh
you
darling
paul
she
said
you
dear
insular
arrogant
englishman
you
have
no
equal
in
the
world
paul
was
offended
if
you
had
said
an
austrian
now
but
a
german
he
growled
sulkily
the
austrians
are
charming
allowed
the
lady
but
they
err
the
other
way
they
have
not
enough
common
sense
they
are
only
great
gentlemen
also
they
are
naturally
awake
whereas
you
english
are
naturally
asleep
and
you
yourself
are
the
sleeping
beauty
paul
they
had
climbed
up
the
path
now
some
two
hundred
feet
and
all
around
them
were
stripling
beeches
of
an
unnaturally
exquisite
green
as
fresh
and
pure
and
light
almost
as
leaves
of
the
forced
lily
of
the
valley
the
whole
world
throbbed
with
youth
and
freshness
and
here
and
there
wide
of
the
path
by
a
mossy
stone
a
gentian
raised
its
azure
head
small
essences
of
sky
the
lady
called
them
let
us
sit
down
on
this
piece
of
rock
paul
said
i
want
to
hear
why
i
am
the
sleeping
beauty
it
is
so
long
since
i
read
the
story
but
was
it
about
a
girl
not
a
man
and
did
she
get
wakened
up
by
a
kiss
she
did
said
the
lady
leaning
back
against
a
tree
behind
her
but
then
it
was
just
her
faculties
which
were
asleep
not
her
soul
could
a
kiss
wake
a
soul
i
think
so
paul
whispered
he
was
seated
on
a
part
of
the
rock
which
jutted
out
a
little
lower
than
her
and
he
was
so
close
as
to
be
almost
touching
her
he
could
look
up
under
the
brim
of
that
tantalising
hat
which
so
often
hid
her
from
his
view
as
they
walked
he
was
quivering
with
excitement
at
this
moment
the
result
of
the
thought
of
a
kiss
and
his
blue
eyes
blazed
with
desire
as
they
devoured
her
face
yes
it
is
so
said
the
lady
a
low
note
in
her
voice
because
huldebrand
gave
undine
a
soul
with
a
kiss
tell
me
about
it
implored
paul
i
am
so
ignorant
who
was
huldebrand
and
what
did
he
do
so
she
began
in
a
dreamy
voice
and
you
who
have
read
de
la
motte
fouqué
dry
version
of
this
exquisite
legend
would
hardly
have
recognised
the
poetry
and
pathos
and
tender
sentiment
she
wove
round
those
two
and
the
varied
moods
of
undine
and
the
passion
of
her
knight
and
when
she
came
to
the
evening
of
their
wedding
when
the
young
priest
had
placed
their
hands
together
and
listened
to
their
vows
when
undine
had
found
her
soul
at
last
in
arms
her
voice
faltered
and
she
stopped
and
looked
down
and
then
said
paul
and
his
breath
came
rather
fast
and
then
he
was
a
man
you
see
paul
so
when
he
had
won
her
love
he
did
not
value
it
he
threw
it
away
oh
no
i
do
believe
it
paul
exclaimed
vehemently
it
was
just
this
brute
huldebrand
but
you
do
know
men
to
think
they
do
not
value
what
they
win
you
do
know
them
indeed
she
looked
down
straight
into
his
face
as
he
gazed
up
at
her
and
to
his
intense
surprise
he
could
have
sworn
her
eyes
were
green
now
as
green
as
emeralds
and
they
held
him
and
fascinated
him
and
paralysed
him
like
those
of
a
snake
i
do
not
know
men
she
said
softly
you
think
not
paul
but
paul
could
hardly
speak
he
buried
his
face
in
her
lap
like
a
child
and
kept
it
there
kissing
her
gloved
hands
his
straw
hat
with
its
zingari
ribbon
lay
on
the
grass
beside
him
and
a
tiny
shaft
of
sunlight
glanced
through
the
trees
gilding
the
crisp
waves
of
his
hair
into
dark
burnished
gold
the
lady
moved
one
hand
from
his
impassioned
caress
and
touched
the
curl
with
her
she
smiled
with
the
tenderness
a
mother
might
have
done
there
there
she
said
not
yet
then
she
drew
her
hand
away
from
him
and
leant
back
half
closing
her
eyes
paul
sat
up
and
stared
around
each
moment
of
the
day
was
providing
new
emotions
for
him
surely
this
was
what
columbus
must
have
felt
nearing
the
new
world
he
pulled
himself
together
she
was
not
angry
then
at
his
outburst
and
his
caress
though
something
in
her
face
warned
him
not
to
err
again
tell
me
the
rest
he
said
pleadingly
why
did
he
not
value
love
and
what
made
the
fool
throw
it
away
because
he
possessed
it
you
see
said
the
lady
that
was
reason
enough
surely
then
she
told
him
of
the
ceasing
of
undine
wayward
moods
after
she
had
received
her
soul
of
her
docility
of
her
tenderness
of
huldebrand
certainty
of
her
love
then
of
his
inevitable
weariness
and
at
last
of
the
court
and
the
meeting
again
with
hildegarde
and
of
all
the
sorrow
that
followed
until
the
end
when
the
fountains
burst
their
stoppings
and
rushed
upwards
wreathing
themselves
into
the
figure
of
undine
to
take
her
love
to
death
with
her
kiss
oh
he
was
wise
paul
said
he
chose
to
die
with
her
kiss
he
knew
at
last
then
what
he
had
thrown
away
that
one
learns
often
paul
when
it
has
grown
too
late
come
let
us
live
in
the
sunshine
live
while
we
may
and
the
lady
rose
and
giving
him
her
hand
she
almost
ran
into
the
bright
light
of
day
where
even
no
tender
shadows
fell
chapter
v
their
return
journey
was
one
of
quiet
the
lady
talked
little
she
leant
back
and
looked
away
across
the
blue
lake
often
apparently
unconscious
of
his
presence
this
troubled
paul
had
he
wearied
her
what
should
he
do
he
was
growing
aware
of
the
fact
that
she
was
not
a
bit
like
his
mother
or
isabella
or
any
of
the
other
women
whom
he
knew
people
whose
moods
he
had
never
even
speculated
about
if
they
had
any
which
he
doubted
why
would
she
speak
had
she
forgotten
him
he
felt
chilled
and
saddened
at
last
as
they
neared
a
small
bay
where
another
tempting
little
mirrored
itself
in
the
clear
water
he
spoke
a
note
in
his
voice
his
charming
young
voice
as
of
a
child
in
distress
are
are
you
cross
with
me
then
she
came
back
from
her
other
world
cross
with
you
foolish
one
no
i
am
dreaming
and
i
forgot
that
you
could
not
know
yet
or
understand
english
paul
who
would
have
me
make
conversation
and
chatter
commonplaces
or
he
feels
a
see
i
will
take
you
where
i
have
been
into
this
infinite
sky
and
air
she
let
her
hand
fall
on
his
arm
and
thrilled
him
look
up
at
pilatus
do
you
see
his
head
so
snowy
and
all
the
delicate
shadows
upon
him
and
his
look
of
mystery
and
those
dark
pines
and
the
great
chasms
and
the
wild
anger
the
giants
were
in
when
they
hurled
these
huge
rocks
about
i
have
been
with
them
and
you
and
i
seem
such
little
people
paul
we
can
not
throw
great
rocks
about
we
are
only
two
small
ants
in
this
grand
world
paul
face
was
puzzled
he
did
not
believe
in
giants
his
mind
was
not
accustomed
yet
to
these
flights
of
speech
he
felt
stupid
and
irritated
with
himself
and
in
some
way
humiliated
the
lady
leant
over
him
her
face
playfully
tender
great
blue
eyes
she
said
so
pretty
so
pretty
what
matter
whether
they
can
see
or
no
and
she
touched
his
lids
with
her
slender
fingers
paul
quivered
in
his
chair
you
know
he
gasped
you
make
me
mad
i
but
wo
you
teach
me
to
see
no
one
wants
to
be
blind
teach
me
to
see
with
your
eyes
lady
my
lady
yes
i
will
teach
you
she
said
teach
you
a
number
of
things
together
we
will
put
on
the
hat
of
darkness
and
go
down
into
hades
we
shall
taste
the
apples
of
the
hesperides
we
will
rob
mercure
of
his
sandals
and
gyges
of
his
ring
and
one
day
paul
when
together
we
have
fathomed
the
meaning
of
it
all
what
will
happen
then
her
last
word
was
a
caress
and
paul
was
too
bewildered
with
joy
to
answer
her
for
a
moment
what
will
happen
he
said
at
last
i
shall
just
love
you
all
then
he
remembered
isabella
waring
and
suddenly
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
they
stopped
for
tea
at
the
quaint
and
after
it
they
wandered
to
pick
gentians
the
lady
was
sweet
and
sympathetic
and
gay
she
ceased
startling
him
with
wild
fancies
indeed
she
spoke
of
simple
everyday
things
and
got
him
to
tell
her
of
his
home
and
oxford
and
his
horses
and
his
dogs
and
when
they
arrived
at
the
subject
of
pike
her
sympathy
drew
paul
nearer
to
her
than
ever
of
course
she
would
love
pike
if
she
only
knew
him
who
could
help
loving
a
dog
like
pike
and
his
master
waxed
eloquent
then
when
he
looked
away
the
lady
weird
chameleon
eyes
melted
upon
him
in
that
strange
tenderness
which
might
have
been
a
mother
watching
the
gambols
of
her
babe
the
shadows
were
quite
deep
when
at
last
they
decided
to
return
to
lucerne
a
small
bunch
of
heaven
own
blue
flower
the
only
trophy
of
the
day
paul
had
never
enjoyed
himself
so
much
in
his
years
of
life
and
what
would
the
evening
bring
surely
more
joy
this
parting
at
the
landing
could
not
be
but
as
the
launch
glided
nearer
and
nearer
his
heart
fell
and
at
last
he
could
bear
the
uncertainty
no
longer
and
for
dinner
he
said
wo
you
dine
me
my
princess
let
me
be
your
host
as
you
have
been
mine
all
but
a
stiffness
seemed
to
fall
upon
her
suddenly
she
appeared
to
have
become
a
stranger
again
almost
thank
you
no
i
can
not
dine
she
said
i
must
write
letters
and
go
to
sleep
paul
felt
an
clutching
his
heart
his
face
became
so
blank
as
to
almost
pale
before
her
eyes
she
leant
forward
and
smiled
will
you
be
lonely
paul
then
at
ten
you
must
come
under
the
ivy
and
wish
me
and
this
was
all
he
could
gain
from
her
she
landed
him
to
walk
back
to
the
hotel
at
the
same
place
from
which
they
had
embarked
and
the
launch
struck
out
again
into
the
lake
he
walked
fast
just
to
be
near
enough
to
see
her
step
ashore
on
to
the
hotel
wharf
but
he
could
not
arrive
in
time
and
her
grey
figure
disappearing
up
the
terrace
steps
was
all
his
hungry
eyes
were
vouchsafed
the
weariness
of
dinner
what
did
it
matter
what
the
food
was
what
did
it
matter
that
a
new
family
of
quite
nice
english
people
had
arrived
and
sat
near
a
fresh
young
girl
and
a
youth
and
a
father
and
mother
people
who
would
certainly
play
billiards
and
probably
bridge
what
did
anything
matter
in
the
world
time
must
be
got
through
simply
got
through
until
ten
that
was
all
at
nine
he
strode
out
and
sat
upon
the
bench
his
thoughts
went
back
in
a
constant
review
of
the
day
how
she
had
looked
where
they
had
sat
what
she
had
said
why
her
eyes
seemed
green
in
the
wood
and
blue
on
the
water
why
her
voice
had
all
those
tones
in
it
why
she
had
been
old
and
young
and
wise
and
childish
then
he
thought
of
the
story
of
undine
and
the
lady
strange
snake
look
when
she
had
said
i
do
not
know
men
you
think
not
paul
his
heart
gave
a
great
bound
at
the
remembrance
he
permitted
himself
no
speculation
as
to
where
he
was
drifting
he
just
sat
there
thrilling
in
every
limb
and
every
sense
and
every
quality
of
his
brain
as
the
clocks
chimed
the
hour
something
told
him
she
was
there
above
him
although
he
heard
no
sound
not
a
soul
was
in
sight
in
this
quiet
corner
he
bounded
on
to
the
bench
to
be
nearer
if
she
should
come
if
she
were
there
hiding
in
the
shadows
this
was
maddening
unbearable
he
would
climb
the
balustrade
to
see
then
out
of
the
blackest
gloom
came
a
laugh
of
silver
a
soft
laugh
that
was
almost
a
caress
and
suddenly
she
crept
close
and
leant
down
over
the
ivy
paul
she
whispered
i
have
come
you
see
to
wish
you
paul
stood
up
to
his
full
height
he
put
out
his
arms
to
draw
her
to
him
but
she
eluded
him
and
darted
aside
he
gave
a
great
sigh
of
pain
slowly
she
came
back
and
bent
over
and
over
of
her
own
accord
so
low
that
at
last
she
was
level
with
his
face
and
slowly
her
red
lips
melted
into
his
young
lips
in
a
long
strange
kiss
then
before
paul
could
grasp
her
or
murmur
one
pleading
word
she
was
gone
and
again
he
found
himself
alone
intoxicated
with
emotion
under
the
night
sky
studded
with
stars
chapter
vi
rain
rain
rain
that
was
not
an
agreeable
sound
to
wake
to
when
one
had
not
had
more
than
a
few
hours
sleep
and
one
only
hope
of
the
day
was
to
see
one
lady
again
so
paul
thought
despairingly
what
would
happen
no
lake
or
mountain
climb
was
possible
but
see
her
he
must
after
that
kiss
that
divine
enthralling
kiss
what
did
it
mean
did
she
love
him
he
loved
her
that
was
certain
the
poor
feeble
emotion
he
had
experienced
for
isabella
was
completely
washed
out
and
gone
now
he
felt
horribly
ashamed
of
himself
when
he
thought
about
it
his
parents
were
perfectly
right
of
course
they
had
known
best
and
fortunately
isabella
had
not
perhaps
believed
him
and
was
not
a
person
of
deep
feeling
anyway
but
the
extreme
discomfort
of
the
thought
of
her
made
him
toss
in
his
bed
what
ought
he
to
do
rush
away
from
lucerne
to
what
good
the
die
was
cast
and
in
any
case
he
was
not
bound
to
isabella
in
any
way
but
at
least
he
ought
to
write
to
her
and
tell
her
he
had
made
a
mistake
that
was
the
only
honest
thing
to
do
a
terrible
duty
and
he
must
brace
himself
up
to
accomplish
it
he
breakfasted
in
his
his
thoughts
scourging
him
the
while
and
afterwards
with
a
bulldog
determination
he
faced
the
and
began
he
tore
up
at
least
three
sheets
to
start
with
no
greek
lines
of
punishment
in
his
boyhood
had
ever
appeared
such
a
task
as
this
he
found
himself
scribbling
profiles
on
the
paper
chiselled
profiles
with
inky
hair
but
no
words
would
come
dear
isabella
he
wrote
at
last
no
my
dear
isabella
then
he
paused
and
bit
the
pen
i
feel
i
ought
to
tell
you
something
has
happened
to
me
i
see
my
parents
were
right
when
oh
dash
it
all
he
said
to
himself
it
a
beastly
sneaking
thing
to
do
to
put
it
like
that
and
he
scratched
the
paragraph
out
and
began
again
i
have
made
a
mistake
in
my
feelings
for
you
i
know
now
that
they
were
those
of
a
brother
o
lord
what
am
i
to
say
next
it
does
sound
bald
this
the
poor
boy
groaned
and
ran
his
hands
through
his
curly
hair
then
seized
the
pen
again
and
continued
as
such
i
shall
love
you
always
dear
isabella
please
forgive
me
if
i
have
caused
you
any
pain
it
was
all
my
fault
and
i
feel
a
beastly
your
very
unhappy
paul
this
was
not
a
masterpiece
but
it
would
have
to
do
so
he
copied
it
out
on
a
fresh
piece
of
paper
then
when
it
was
all
finished
and
addressed
he
ran
down
and
posted
it
himself
in
the
hall
with
some
of
the
emotions
alexander
may
have
experienced
when
he
burnt
his
ships
the
clock
struck
eleven
at
what
time
would
he
see
the
lady
lady
he
called
her
now
some
instinct
told
him
she
did
not
wish
the
hotel
people
to
be
aware
of
their
acquaintance
he
felt
it
wiser
not
to
send
a
note
he
must
wait
and
hope
rain
or
not
he
was
too
english
to
stay
indoors
all
day
so
out
he
went
and
into
the
town
the
quaint
bridge
pleased
him
he
tried
to
think
how
she
would
have
told
him
to
use
his
eyes
he
must
not
be
stupid
he
said
to
himself
and
already
he
began
to
perceive
new
meanings
in
things
coming
back
he
chanced
to
stop
and
look
in
at
the
fur
shop
under
the
hotel
there
were
some
nice
skins
there
and
what
caught
his
attention
most
was
a
really
splendid
tiger
a
magnificent
creature
the
beast
must
have
been
the
deepest
most
perfectly
marked
largest
one
he
had
ever
seen
he
stood
for
some
time
admiring
it
an
infinitely
better
specimen
than
his
lady
had
over
her
couch
should
he
buy
it
for
her
would
she
take
it
would
it
please
her
to
think
he
had
remembered
it
might
be
what
she
would
like
he
went
into
the
shop
it
was
not
even
dear
as
tigers
go
and
his
parents
had
given
him
ample
money
for
any
follies
confound
it
henrietta
the
boy
must
have
his
head
sir
charles
verdayne
had
said
he
my
son
you
know
and
you
ca
expect
to
cure
him
of
one
wench
unless
you
provide
him
with
shekels
to
buy
another
which
crudely
expressed
wisdom
had
been
followed
and
paul
had
no
worries
where
his
banking
account
was
concerned
he
bought
the
tiger
and
ordered
it
to
be
sent
to
his
rooms
immediately
then
there
was
lunch
to
be
thought
of
she
would
not
be
there
probably
but
still
he
had
a
faint
hope
she
was
not
there
nor
were
any
preparations
made
for
her
but
when
one
is
and
hungry
even
if
deeply
in
love
one
must
eat
the
english
people
had
the
next
table
beyond
the
sacred
one
of
the
lady
the
girl
was
pretty
and
young
and
laughing
but
what
a
doll
thought
paul
what
a
meaningless
wax
doll
not
worth
not
worth
a
moment
glancing
at
and
the
pink
and
white
fluffy
girl
was
saying
to
herself
there
is
paul
verdayne
again
i
wish
he
remembered
he
had
met
me
at
the
de
courcys
though
we
were
introduced
i
must
get
percy
to
scrape
up
a
conversation
with
him
i
wish
mamma
had
not
made
me
wear
this
green
alpaca
but
paul
blue
eyes
gazed
through
and
beyond
her
and
saw
her
not
so
all
this
prettiness
was
wasted
and
directly
after
lunch
he
returned
to
his
sitting
room
the
tiger
would
probably
have
arrived
and
he
wanted
to
further
examine
it
yes
it
was
there
he
pulled
it
out
and
spread
it
over
the
floor
what
a
splendid
creature
it
reminded
him
in
some
way
of
her
his
lady
then
he
went
into
his
bedroom
and
fetched
a
pair
of
scissors
and
proceeded
to
kneel
on
the
floor
and
pare
away
the
black
cloth
which
came
beyond
the
skin
it
looked
banal
and
he
knew
she
would
not
like
that
oh
he
was
awaking
this
beautiful
young
paul
he
had
scarcely
finished
when
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
and
dmitry
appeared
with
a
note
the
thin
remembered
paper
thrilled
him
and
he
took
it
from
the
servant
hand
paul
i
am
in
the
devil
mood
about
come
to
me
by
the
terrace
steps
that
was
all
there
was
no
date
or
signature
but
paul
heart
beat
in
his
throat
with
joy
i
want
the
skin
to
go
to
madame
he
said
have
you
any
means
of
conveying
it
to
her
without
the
whole
world
seeing
it
go
the
stately
servant
bowed
if
the
excellency
would
help
him
to
fold
it
up
he
said
he
would
take
it
now
to
his
own
room
and
from
thence
to
the
numero
it
is
not
a
very
easy
thing
to
fold
up
a
huge
into
a
brown
paper
parcel
tied
with
string
but
it
was
accomplished
somehow
and
dmitry
disappeared
noiselessly
with
it
and
an
answer
to
the
note
i
will
be
there
sweet
lady
your
own
paul
and
he
was
a
bright
fire
burnt
in
the
grate
and
some
palest
silk
curtains
were
drawn
in
the
lady
room
when
paul
entered
from
the
terrace
and
loveliest
sight
of
all
in
front
of
the
fire
stretched
at
full
length
was
his
tiger
and
on
him
also
at
full
length
reclined
the
lady
garbed
in
some
strange
clinging
garment
of
heavy
purple
crepe
its
hem
embroidered
with
gold
one
white
arm
resting
on
the
beast
head
her
back
supported
by
a
pile
of
the
velvet
cushions
and
a
heap
of
rarely
bound
books
at
her
side
while
between
her
red
lips
was
a
rose
not
redder
than
they
an
almost
scarlet
rose
paul
had
never
seen
one
as
red
before
the
whole
picture
was
barbaric
it
might
have
been
some
dream
of
the
favourite
in
a
harem
it
was
not
what
one
would
expect
to
find
in
a
sedate
swiss
hotel
she
did
not
stir
as
he
stepped
in
dropping
the
heavy
curtains
after
him
she
merely
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
paul
through
and
through
her
whole
expression
was
changed
it
was
wicked
and
dangerous
and
it
seemed
quite
true
as
she
had
said
she
was
evidently
in
the
devil
mood
paul
bounded
forward
but
she
raised
one
hand
to
stop
him
no
you
must
not
come
near
me
paul
i
am
not
safe
not
yet
see
you
must
sit
there
and
we
will
talk
and
she
pointed
to
a
great
chair
of
venetian
workmanship
and
wonderful
old
velvet
which
was
new
to
his
view
i
bought
that
chair
in
the
town
this
morning
at
the
curiosity
shop
on
the
top
of
weggisstrasse
which
long
ago
was
the
home
of
the
venetian
envoy
here
and
you
bought
me
the
tiger
paul
ah
that
was
good
my
beautiful
tiger
and
she
gave
a
movement
like
a
snake
of
joy
to
feel
its
fur
under
her
while
she
stretched
out
her
hands
and
caressed
the
creature
where
the
hair
turned
white
and
black
at
the
side
and
was
deep
and
soft
beautiful
one
beautiful
one
she
purred
and
i
know
all
your
feelings
and
your
passions
and
now
i
have
got
your
skin
for
the
joy
of
my
skin
and
she
quivered
again
with
the
movements
of
a
snake
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
that
paul
felt
far
from
calm
during
this
scene
indeed
he
was
obliged
to
hold
on
to
his
great
chair
to
prevent
himself
from
seizing
her
in
his
arms
i
i
so
glad
you
like
him
he
said
in
a
choked
voice
i
thought
probably
you
would
and
your
own
was
not
worthy
of
you
i
found
this
by
chance
and
oh
good
god
if
you
knew
how
you
are
making
me
feel
lying
there
wasting
your
caresses
upon
it
she
tossed
the
scarlet
rose
over
to
him
it
hit
his
mouth
i
am
not
wasting
them
she
said
the
innocence
of
a
kitten
in
her
strange
eyes
their
colour
impossible
to
define
indeed
not
paul
he
was
my
lover
in
another
life
perhaps
who
knows
but
i
said
paul
who
was
now
quite
mad
want
to
be
your
lover
in
this
then
he
gasped
at
his
own
boldness
with
a
lightning
movement
she
lay
on
her
face
raised
her
elbows
on
the
tiger
head
and
supported
her
chin
in
her
hands
perfectly
straight
out
her
body
was
the
twisted
purple
drapery
outlining
her
perfect
shape
and
flowing
in
graceful
lines
beyond
like
a
tail
the
velvet
pillows
fell
scattered
at
one
side
paul
what
do
you
know
of
lovers
or
love
she
said
my
baby
paul
i
know
enough
to
know
i
know
nothing
yet
which
is
worth
knowing
he
said
confusedly
but
but
do
you
understand
i
want
you
to
teach
me
you
are
so
sweet
paul
when
you
plead
like
that
i
am
taking
in
every
bit
of
you
in
your
way
as
perfect
as
this
tiger
but
we
must
talk
oh
such
a
great
great
deal
first
a
rage
of
passion
was
racing
through
paul
his
incoherent
thoughts
were
that
he
did
not
want
to
talk
only
to
kiss
her
to
devour
her
to
strangle
her
with
love
if
necessary
he
bit
the
rose
you
see
paul
love
is
a
purely
physical
emotion
she
continued
we
could
speak
an
immense
amount
about
souls
and
sympathy
and
understanding
and
devotion
all
beautiful
things
in
their
way
and
possible
to
be
enjoyed
at
a
distance
from
one
another
all
the
things
which
make
passion
noble
but
without
love
which
passion
these
things
dwindle
and
become
duties
presently
when
the
hysterical
exaltation
cools
love
is
it
means
to
be
close
close
to
be
clasped
to
be
touching
to
be
one
her
voice
was
low
so
concentrated
as
to
be
startling
in
contrast
to
the
drip
of
the
rain
outside
and
her
eyes
half
closed
and
gleaming
burnt
into
his
brain
it
seemed
as
if
strange
flames
of
green
darted
from
their
pupils
but
that
is
what
i
want
paul
said
unsteadily
without
counting
the
cost
tears
and
cold
steel
and
blood
she
whispered
wait
a
while
beautiful
paul
he
started
back
chilled
for
a
second
and
in
that
second
she
changed
her
position
pulling
the
cushions
around
her
nestling
into
them
and
drawing
herself
cosily
up
like
a
child
playing
on
a
mat
in
front
of
the
fire
while
with
a
face
of
perfect
innocence
she
looked
up
as
she
drew
one
of
her
great
books
nearer
and
said
in
a
dreamy
voice
now
we
will
read
paul
but
paul
was
too
moved
to
speak
these
rapid
changes
were
too
much
for
him
greatly
advanced
though
he
had
become
in
these
short
days
since
he
had
known
her
he
leant
back
in
his
chair
every
nerve
in
his
body
quivering
his
young
fresh
face
almost
pale
paul
she
cooed
plaintively
i
shall
be
reasonable
again
perhaps
and
human
but
i
am
capricious
and
wayward
and
must
be
teased
i
want
to
read
about
cupid
and
psyche
from
this
wonderful
ass
of
apuleius
just
a
simple
tale
for
a
wet
day
and
you
and
me
read
then
said
paul
resigned
and
she
commenced
in
latin
in
a
chanting
tender
voice
paul
had
forgotten
most
of
the
latin
he
knew
but
he
remembered
enough
to
be
aware
that
this
must
be
as
easy
as
english
to
her
as
it
flowed
along
in
a
rich
rhythmic
sound
it
soothed
him
he
seemed
to
be
dreaming
of
flowery
lands
and
running
streams
after
a
while
she
looked
up
again
and
then
with
one
of
her
sudden
movements
like
a
graceful
cat
she
was
beside
him
leaning
from
the
back
of
his
chair
paul
she
whispered
right
in
his
ear
am
i
being
wicked
for
you
i
can
not
help
it
the
devil
is
in
me
and
now
i
must
sing
sing
then
said
paul
maddened
with
again
arising
emotion
she
seized
a
guitar
that
lay
near
and
began
in
a
soft
voice
in
some
language
he
knew
not
a
cadence
of
melody
he
had
never
heard
but
one
whose
notes
made
strange
quivers
all
up
his
spine
an
exquisite
pleasure
of
sound
that
was
almost
pain
and
when
he
felt
he
could
bear
no
more
she
flung
the
instrument
aside
and
leant
over
his
chair
again
caressing
his
curls
with
her
dainty
fingers
and
purring
unknown
strange
words
in
his
ear
paul
was
young
and
unlearned
in
many
things
he
was
completely
enthralled
and
under
her
dominion
but
he
was
naturally
no
weakling
of
body
or
mind
and
this
was
more
than
he
could
stand
must
be
teased
my
god
it
is
you
who
are
maddening
me
he
cried
his
voice
hoarse
with
emotion
do
you
think
i
am
a
statue
or
a
table
or
chair
or
inanimate
like
that
tiger
there
i
am
not
i
tell
you
and
he
seized
her
in
his
arms
raining
kisses
upon
her
which
whatever
they
lacked
in
subtlety
made
up
for
in
their
passion
and
strength
some
day
some
man
will
kill
you
i
suppose
but
i
shall
be
your
lover
first
the
lady
gasped
she
looked
up
at
him
in
bewildered
surprise
as
a
child
might
do
who
sets
a
light
to
a
whole
box
of
matches
in
play
what
a
naughty
naughty
toy
to
burn
so
quickly
for
such
a
little
strike
but
paul
young
strong
arms
held
her
close
she
could
not
struggle
or
move
then
she
laughed
a
laugh
of
pure
glad
joy
beautiful
savage
paul
she
whispered
do
you
love
me
tell
me
that
love
you
he
said
good
god
love
you
madly
and
you
know
it
darling
queen
then
said
the
lady
in
a
voice
in
which
all
the
caresses
of
the
world
seemed
melted
then
sweet
paul
i
shall
teach
you
many
things
and
among
them
i
shall
teach
you
how
to
live
and
outside
the
black
storm
made
the
darkness
fall
early
and
inside
the
logs
tumbled
together
causing
a
cloud
of
golden
sparks
and
then
the
flames
leapt
up
again
and
crackled
in
the
grate
chapter
vii
at
dinner
that
night
the
lady
came
in
after
paul
was
seated
she
was
all
in
black
velvet
stately
and
dignified
and
fine
she
passed
his
chair
and
took
her
seat
not
the
faintest
sign
of
recognition
on
her
face
and
although
he
was
prepared
for
this
for
some
reason
his
heart
sank
for
a
moment
her
demeanour
was
the
same
as
on
the
first
night
he
had
seen
her
hardly
raising
her
eyes
eating
little
of
the
most
exquisite
food
and
appearing
totally
unconscious
of
her
neighbours
or
their
ways
she
caused
a
flutter
of
excitement
at
the
english
table
the
only
other
party
except
two
old
men
in
a
corner
who
had
dined
so
late
and
they
were
through
their
repast
before
she
began
hers
paul
was
annoyed
to
see
how
they
stared
stared
at
lady
but
what
joy
it
was
to
sit
there
and
realise
that
she
was
his
his
very
own
and
only
four
nights
ago
he
had
been
a
rude
stranger
too
criticising
her
every
movement
and
drinking
too
much
port
with
annoyance
over
it
all
and
now
his
whole
life
was
changed
he
saw
with
new
eyes
and
heard
with
new
ears
even
his
casual
observation
was
altered
and
sharpened
so
that
he
noticed
the
texture
of
the
cloth
and
the
quality
of
the
glass
and
the
shape
of
the
room
and
its
decoration
and
how
insupportably
commonplace
the
good
english
family
seemed
that
miss
with
her
pink
cheeks
and
fluffy
hair
without
a
hat
women
hair
should
be
black
and
grow
in
heavy
waves
he
was
certain
of
that
now
how
like
them
to
come
into
a
foreign
restaurant
hatless
just
because
they
were
english
and
must
impose
their
customs
he
sat
and
mused
on
it
all
as
he
looked
at
his
queen
a
sense
of
complete
joy
and
satisfaction
stealing
over
him
his
wild
excitement
and
emotion
calmed
for
the
time
the
delightful
sensation
of
sharing
a
secret
with
her
a
known
only
to
themselves
think
if
these
philistines
guessed
at
it
even
their
faces
and
at
this
thought
paul
almost
laughed
aloud
with
passionate
interest
he
absorbed
every
little
detail
about
his
lady
how
exactly
she
knew
what
suited
her
how
refined
and
and
quiet
it
all
was
and
what
an
air
of
breeding
and
command
she
had
in
the
poise
of
her
little
greek
head
what
did
it
matter
what
age
she
was
or
of
what
nation
what
did
anything
matter
since
she
was
his
and
at
that
thought
his
heart
began
to
beat
again
and
cause
him
to
speculate
as
to
his
evening
would
she
let
him
come
back
to
the
terrace
room
after
dinner
or
must
he
get
through
the
time
as
best
he
could
when
he
had
left
her
half
dazed
with
joy
and
languor
no
arrangements
had
been
made
no
definite
plans
settled
but
of
course
she
could
not
mean
him
not
to
wish
her
not
for
one
second
before
she
left
the
room
their
eyes
met
she
raised
a
red
rose
which
she
had
taken
from
the
silver
vase
casually
to
her
lips
and
then
passed
out
but
paul
knew
she
had
meant
the
kiss
for
him
and
his
whole
being
was
uplifted
it
was
still
pouring
with
rain
no
possible
excuse
to
smoke
on
the
terrace
it
might
be
wiser
to
stay
in
the
hall
surely
dmitry
would
come
with
some
message
before
very
long
if
he
was
patient
and
waited
her
pleasure
but
ten
struck
and
there
was
no
sign
only
the
english
youth
percy
trevellian
had
got
into
conversation
with
him
and
was
proposing
billiards
to
pass
the
time
paul
loved
billiards
but
not
heavens
what
an
idea
go
off
to
the
now
he
said
he
had
a
headache
and
answered
rather
shortly
in
fact
and
then
to
escape
further
importunity
went
up
to
his
there
to
await
the
turn
of
events
leaving
poor
little
mabel
trevellian
gazing
after
him
with
longing
eyes
did
you
see
at
dinner
how
he
stared
at
that
foreign
person
mamma
she
said
men
are
such
fools
clarkson
told
me
as
she
fastened
my
dress
she
heard
she
was
some
grand
duchess
or
queen
travelling
incognito
for
her
health
very
plain
and
did
you
think
so
mamma
and
quite
old
no
dear
most
distinguished
not
a
girl
of
course
but
quite
the
appearance
of
a
princess
said
mabel
mother
who
had
seen
the
world
paul
meanwhile
paced
his
room
an
anxious
excitement
was
now
his
portion
surely
surely
she
could
not
mean
him
not
to
see
her
not
to
say
one
little
what
should
he
do
what
possible
plan
invent
as
eleven
chimed
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
rain
or
no
he
must
go
out
on
the
terrace
those
mad
english
the
porter
said
to
himself
as
he
watched
tall
figure
disappear
in
the
dripping
night
and
there
till
after
twelve
he
paced
the
path
under
the
trees
but
no
light
showed
the
terrace
gate
was
locked
it
was
chilly
and
wet
and
miserable
and
at
last
he
crept
back
utterly
depressed
to
bed
but
not
to
sleep
even
his
youth
and
health
were
not
proof
against
the
mad
emotions
of
the
day
he
tossed
and
turned
a
thousand
questions
singing
in
his
brain
was
it
really
he
who
had
been
chosen
by
this
divine
woman
for
her
lover
and
if
so
why
was
he
alone
now
instead
of
holding
her
in
his
arms
what
did
it
all
mean
who
was
she
where
would
it
end
but
here
he
refused
to
think
further
he
was
living
at
all
events
living
as
he
had
never
dreamed
was
possible
and
yet
poor
paul
he
was
only
on
the
rim
of
all
that
he
was
soon
to
know
of
life
at
last
he
fell
asleep
one
sentence
ringing
in
his
ears
tears
and
cold
steel
and
blood
but
if
he
was
young
he
was
a
gallant
gentleman
and
fear
had
no
place
in
his
dreams
chapter
viii
next
day
they
went
to
the
bürgenstock
to
stay
it
was
all
arranged
with
consummate
simplicity
paul
was
to
start
for
a
climb
he
told
his
valet
and
for
a
week
they
would
leave
lucerne
mme
zalenska
was
not
very
well
it
appeared
and
consented
to
try
at
the
suggestion
of
the
amiable
manager
inspired
by
dmitry
a
few
days
in
higher
air
there
would
not
be
a
soul
in
their
hotel
on
top
of
the
bürgenstock
probably
and
she
could
have
complete
rest
they
did
not
arrive
together
paul
was
the
first
he
had
not
seen
her
dmitry
had
given
him
his
final
instructions
and
he
awaited
her
coming
with
passionate
impatience
he
had
written
to
her
on
awaking
a
coherent
torrent
of
love
marvellously
unlike
the
letter
which
had
gone
to
poor
isabella
only
a
few
days
before
in
this
to
his
lady
he
had
said
he
could
not
bear
it
the
uncertainty
of
seeing
her
and
had
suggested
the
bürgenstock
crudely
without
any
of
the
clever
details
which
afterwards
made
it
possible
he
paul
verdayne
not
quite
years
old
and
english
to
suggest
without
a
backward
thought
or
a
qualm
that
a
lady
whom
he
had
known
five
days
should
come
and
live
with
him
and
be
his
love
none
of
his
friends
accustomed
to
his
bashful
habits
would
have
believed
it
only
his
father
perhaps
might
have
smiled
as
for
the
lady
henrietta
she
would
have
fainted
on
the
spot
but
fortune
favoured
him
they
did
not
know
no
excitement
of
the
wildest
day
hunting
had
ever
made
his
pulses
bound
like
this
dmitry
had
arranged
everything
paul
was
a
young
english
secretary
to
madame
who
had
much
writing
to
do
and
in
any
case
it
is
not
the
affair
of
respectable
foreign
hotels
to
pry
into
their
relationship
when
a
large
suite
has
been
engaged
paul
valet
the
son
of
an
old
retainer
of
the
family
was
an
honest
fellow
and
devoted
to
his
master
but
sir
charles
verdayne
had
decided
to
make
things
doubly
sure
tompson
he
had
said
the
morning
before
they
left
however
verdayne
may
amuse
himself
while
you
are
abroad
your
eyes
and
mouth
are
shut
remember
no
d
d
gossip
back
to
the
servants
here
or
in
hotels
or
houses
and
above
all
no
details
must
ever
reach
her
ladyship
if
he
gets
into
any
thundering
mess
let
me
know
but
mum
the
word
understand
tompson
i
do
sir
charles
said
tompson
stolidly
and
he
did
as
events
proved
the
rooms
on
the
bürgenstock
looked
so
simple
so
unlike
the
at
lucerne
just
fresh
and
clean
and
primitive
paul
wandered
through
them
and
in
the
one
allotted
to
himself
he
came
upon
anna
madame
maid
whom
dmitry
had
pointed
out
to
him
putting
sheets
as
fine
as
gossamer
on
his
bed
with
the
softest
down
pillows
how
dear
of
his
lady
to
think
thus
of
him
her
secretary
the
tiger
his
tiger
had
arrived
in
the
and
some
simple
cushions
of
silk
and
spring
flowers
decorated
the
vases
there
were
no
tuberoses
or
anything
or
forced
the
sun
blazed
in
at
the
windows
the
green
trees
all
washed
and
fresh
from
the
rain
gladdened
his
eye
and
down
below
a
sapphire
lake
reflected
the
mountains
what
a
setting
for
a
no
wonder
paul
trod
on
air
the
only
possible
crumpled
were
some
sentences
in
the
reply
to
his
impassioned
letter
of
the
morning
yes
i
will
come
paul
but
only
on
one
condition
that
you
never
ask
me
questions
as
to
who
i
am
or
where
i
am
going
you
must
promise
me
to
take
life
as
a
summer
holiday
an
episode
and
if
fate
gives
us
this
great
joy
you
must
not
try
to
fetter
me
now
or
at
any
future
time
or
control
my
movements
you
must
give
me
your
word
of
honour
for
this
you
will
never
seek
to
discover
who
or
what
was
your
loved
one
you
must
never
try
to
follow
me
yes
i
will
come
for
now
when
i
have
your
assurance
but
i
will
go
when
i
will
go
in
silence
and
paul
had
given
his
word
he
felt
he
could
not
look
ahead
he
must
just
live
in
this
gorgeous
joy
and
trust
to
chance
so
he
awaited
her
thrilling
in
all
his
being
about
tea
time
she
drove
up
in
a
carriage
she
and
dmitry
having
come
the
long
way
round
and
was
it
not
right
that
her
secretary
should
meet
and
assist
her
out
and
conduct
her
to
her
apartments
how
beautiful
she
looked
all
in
palest
grey
and
somehow
the
things
had
a
younger
shape
her
skirt
was
short
and
he
could
see
her
small
and
slender
feet
while
a
straw
hat
and
veil
adorned
her
black
hair
everything
was
simple
and
as
it
should
be
for
a
mountain
top
and
unsophisticated
surroundings
tea
was
laid
out
on
the
balcony
fragrant
russian
tea
and
when
dmitry
had
lit
the
silver
kettle
lamp
he
retired
and
left
them
alone
in
peace
darling
said
paul
as
he
folded
her
in
his
arms
darling
darling
and
when
she
could
speak
the
lady
cooed
back
to
him
so
sweet
a
word
is
that
my
paul
sweeter
in
english
than
in
any
other
language
and
you
are
glad
i
have
come
and
we
shall
live
a
little
and
be
quite
happy
here
in
our
pretty
nest
all
fresh
and
not
a
bit
too
grand
is
it
not
so
oh
what
joys
there
are
in
life
and
oh
how
foolish
just
to
miss
them
indeed
said
paul
then
they
played
with
the
tea
and
she
showed
him
how
he
was
to
drink
it
with
lemon
she
was
sweet
as
a
girl
and
said
no
vague
startling
things
it
was
as
if
she
were
a
young
bride
and
paul
were
complete
master
and
lord
wild
happiness
rushed
through
him
how
had
he
ever
endured
the
time
before
he
had
met
her
when
they
had
finished
they
went
out
she
must
walk
she
said
and
paul
being
english
must
want
exercise
oh
she
knew
the
english
and
their
exercise
and
of
course
she
must
think
of
everything
that
would
be
for
the
pleasure
of
her
lover
paul
and
he
you
old
worn
people
of
the
world
who
perhaps
are
reading
think
what
all
this
was
to
paul
his
young
strong
life
vibrating
to
passionate
joys
his
imagination
kindled
his
very
being
uplifted
and
thrilled
with
happiness
his
charming
soul
expanded
he
found
himself
saying
gracious
tender
phrases
to
her
every
moment
he
was
growing
more
passionately
in
love
and
in
each
new
mood
she
seemed
the
more
divine
not
one
trace
of
her
waywardness
of
the
day
before
remained
her
eyes
as
they
glanced
at
him
from
under
her
hat
were
bashful
and
sweet
no
look
of
the
devil
to
provoke
a
saint
she
talked
gently
he
must
take
her
to
the
place
where
she
had
peeped
at
him
through
the
trees
and
oh
paul
she
said
if
you
had
known
that
day
how
you
tempted
me
looking
up
at
me
your
whole
soul
in
your
eyes
i
had
to
run
run
run
and
now
i
have
caught
you
darling
mine
said
paul
but
you
were
wrong
i
had
no
soul
it
is
you
who
are
giving
me
one
now
they
sat
on
the
bench
where
he
had
sat
she
was
getting
joy
out
of
the
colour
of
the
moss
the
tints
of
the
beeches
every
little
shade
and
shape
of
nature
and
letting
paul
see
with
her
eyes
and
all
the
while
she
was
nestling
near
him
like
a
tender
to
her
mate
paul
heart
swelled
with
exultation
he
felt
good
as
if
he
could
be
kind
to
every
one
as
if
his
temper
were
a
thing
to
be
ashamed
of
and
all
his
faults
as
if
for
ever
he
must
be
her
own
true
knight
and
defender
and
show
her
he
was
worthy
of
this
great
gift
and
joy
and
ah
how
could
he
put
into
words
his
tender
worshipping
love
so
the
afternoon
faded
into
evening
and
the
young
crescent
moon
began
to
show
in
the
sky
a
slender
moon
of
silver
only
born
the
night
before
see
this
is
our
moon
said
the
lady
and
as
she
waxes
so
will
our
love
wax
but
now
she
is
young
and
fresh
and
fair
like
it
come
my
paul
let
us
go
to
our
house
soon
we
shall
dine
and
i
want
to
be
beautiful
for
you
so
they
went
in
to
their
little
hotel
she
was
all
in
white
when
paul
found
her
in
their
inner
salon
where
they
were
to
dine
alone
waited
on
only
by
dmitry
her
splendid
hair
was
bound
with
a
fillet
of
gold
and
fell
in
two
long
strands
twisted
with
gold
nearly
to
her
knees
her
garment
was
soft
and
clinging
and
unlike
any
garment
he
had
ever
seen
they
sat
on
a
sofa
together
the
table
in
front
of
them
and
they
ate
slowly
and
whispered
much
and
before
paul
could
taste
his
wine
she
kissed
his
glass
and
sipped
from
it
and
made
him
do
the
same
with
hers
the
food
was
of
the
simplest
and
the
only
things
exotic
were
the
great
red
strawberries
at
the
end
dmitry
had
left
them
placing
the
coffee
on
the
table
as
he
went
and
a
bottle
of
the
rare
golden
wine
then
this
strange
lady
grew
more
tender
still
she
must
lie
in
arms
and
he
must
feed
her
with
strawberries
and
the
thought
came
to
him
that
her
mouth
looked
as
red
as
they
to
say
he
was
intoxicated
with
pleasure
and
love
is
to
put
it
as
it
was
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
arrived
at
a
zenith
and
yet
he
knew
there
would
be
more
to
come
at
last
she
raised
herself
and
poured
out
the
yellow
wine
into
one
glass
my
paul
she
said
this
is
our
wedding
might
and
this
is
our
wedding
wine
taste
from
this
our
glass
and
say
if
it
is
good
and
to
the
day
of
his
death
if
ever
paul
should
taste
that
wine
again
a
mad
current
of
passionate
remembrance
will
come
to
him
and
still
more
passionate
regret
oh
the
divine
joy
of
that
night
they
sat
upon
the
balcony
presently
and
elaine
in
her
worshipping
thoughts
of
lancelot
marguerite
wooed
by
faust
the
youngest
girl
bride
could
not
have
been
more
sweet
or
tender
or
submissive
than
this
wayward
tiger
queen
paul
she
said
out
of
the
whole
world
tonight
there
are
only
you
and
i
who
matter
sweetheart
is
it
not
so
and
is
not
that
your
english
word
for
lover
and
loved
and
paul
who
had
never
even
heard
it
used
except
in
a
kind
of
joke
now
knew
it
was
what
he
had
always
admired
yes
indeed
it
was
sweetheart
and
she
was
his
remember
paul
she
whispered
when
passion
maddening
him
he
clasped
her
violently
in
his
arms
remember
whatever
happens
whatever
comes
for
now
there
is
no
other
reason
in
all
of
this
but
just
i
love
you
i
love
you
paul
my
queen
my
queen
said
paul
his
voice
hoarse
in
his
throat
and
the
wind
played
in
softest
zephyrs
and
the
stars
blazed
in
the
sky
mirroring
themselves
in
the
blue
lake
below
such
was
their
wedding
night
oh
glorious
youth
and
still
more
glorious
love
chapter
ix
who
can
tell
the
joy
of
their
awakening
the
transcendent
pleasure
to
paul
to
be
allowed
to
play
with
his
lady
hair
all
unbound
for
him
to
do
with
as
he
willed
the
glory
to
realise
she
was
his
his
own
in
his
arms
and
then
to
be
tenderly
masterful
and
give
himself
lordly
airs
of
possession
she
was
almost
silent
only
the
history
of
the
whole
world
of
passion
seemed
written
in
her
eyes
slumbrous
inscrutable
their
heavy
lashes
making
shadows
on
her
soft
smooth
cheeks
the
was
gone
a
thing
of
mystery
lay
there
instead
unresisting
motionless
white
now
and
then
paul
looked
at
her
half
in
fear
was
she
real
was
it
some
dream
and
would
he
wake
in
his
room
at
verdayne
place
among
the
sporting
prints
and
solid
chippendale
furniture
to
hear
tompson
saying
eight
sir
and
a
fine
day
oh
no
no
she
was
real
he
raised
himself
and
bent
down
to
touch
her
tenderly
with
his
forefinger
yes
all
this
fascination
was
indeed
his
living
and
breathing
and
warm
and
he
was
her
lover
and
lord
ah
the
same
coloured
silk
curtains
as
at
lucerne
were
drawn
over
the
open
windows
so
the
sun
in
high
heaven
seemed
only
as
dawn
in
the
room
filtering
though
the
outside
but
what
was
time
time
counts
as
one
lives
and
paul
was
living
now
it
was
twelve
before
they
were
ready
for
their
dainty
breakfast
laid
out
under
the
balcony
awning
and
the
lady
talked
tenderly
and
occupied
herself
with
the
fancies
of
her
lord
as
a
new
bride
should
but
all
the
time
the
mystery
stayed
in
her
eyes
and
the
thought
came
to
paul
that
were
he
to
live
with
her
for
a
hundred
years
he
would
never
be
sure
of
their
real
meaning
what
shall
we
do
with
our
day
my
paul
she
said
presently
see
you
shall
choose
shall
we
climb
to
the
highest
point
on
this
mountain
and
look
at
our
kingdom
of
trees
and
lake
below
or
shall
we
rest
in
the
launch
and
glide
over
the
blue
water
and
dream
sweet
dreams
or
shall
we
drive
in
the
carriage
far
inland
to
a
quaint
farmhouse
i
know
where
we
shall
see
people
living
in
simple
happiness
with
their
cows
and
their
sheep
decide
sweetheart
decide
whatever
you
would
wish
my
queen
said
paul
then
the
lady
frowned
and
summer
lightnings
flashed
from
her
eyes
of
course
what
i
shall
wish
but
i
have
told
you
to
choose
feeble
paul
there
is
nothing
so
irritates
me
as
these
english
answers
should
i
have
asked
you
to
select
our
day
had
i
decided
myself
i
would
have
commanded
dmitry
to
make
the
arrangements
that
is
all
but
no
i
am
thy
obedient
one
i
ask
my
love
to
choose
for
me
i
may
want
my
own
will
i
desire
only
thine
beloved
and
she
leant
forward
and
looked
into
his
eyes
the
mountain
top
then
said
paul
because
there
we
can
sit
and
i
can
gaze
at
you
and
learn
more
of
life
close
to
your
lips
i
might
not
touch
you
in
the
launch
and
you
might
look
at
others
at
the
farm
and
it
seems
as
if
i
could
not
bear
one
glance
or
word
turned
from
myself
today
you
have
chosen
well
the
strange
words
pleased
him
he
must
know
their
meaning
and
learn
to
pronounce
them
himself
and
all
this
between
their
dainty
dishes
took
time
so
it
was
an
hour
later
before
they
started
for
their
walk
up
up
those
winding
paths
among
the
firs
and
larches
up
and
up
to
the
top
they
dawdled
slowly
until
they
reached
their
goal
there
aloof
from
the
beaten
track
safe
from
the
prying
eyes
of
some
chance
stranger
they
sat
down
their
backs
against
a
giant
rock
and
all
the
glory
of
their
lake
and
to
gaze
at
down
below
paul
had
carried
her
cloak
and
now
they
spread
it
out
covering
their
couch
of
moss
and
lichen
a
soft
languor
was
over
them
both
passion
was
asleep
for
the
while
but
what
exquisite
bliss
to
sit
thus
undisturbed
in
their
eyrie
he
and
she
alone
in
all
the
world
her
words
came
back
to
him
love
means
to
be
clasped
to
be
close
to
be
touching
to
be
one
yes
they
were
one
then
she
began
to
talk
softly
to
open
yet
more
windows
in
his
soul
to
joy
and
sunshine
her
mind
seemed
so
vast
each
hour
gave
him
fresh
surprises
in
the
perception
of
her
infinite
knowledge
while
she
charmed
his
fancy
by
her
delicate
modes
of
expression
and
perfect
pronunciation
no
single
word
slurred
over
paul
she
said
presently
how
small
seem
the
puny
conventions
of
the
world
do
they
not
beloved
small
as
those
little
boats
floating
like
scattered
on
the
great
lake
down
there
they
were
invented
first
to
fill
the
place
of
the
zest
which
fighting
and
holding
one
own
by
the
strength
of
one
arm
originally
gave
to
man
now
he
has
only
laws
to
combat
instead
of
a
fiercer
fellow
creature
a
dull
exchange
forsooth
here
are
you
and
i
mated
and
wedded
and
perfectly
happy
and
yet
by
these
foolish
laws
we
are
sinning
and
you
would
be
more
nobly
employed
yawning
with
some
bony
english
miss
for
your
wife
and
i
by
the
side
of
a
mad
drunken
husband
all
because
the
law
made
us
swear
a
vow
to
keep
for
ever
stationary
an
emotion
emotion
which
we
can
no
more
control
than
the
trees
can
which
way
the
wind
will
blow
their
branches
to
love
oh
yes
they
call
it
that
at
the
altar
together
by
god
as
likely
as
not
two
human
creatures
who
hate
each
other
and
are
standing
there
swearing
those
impossibilities
for
some
political
purpose
and
advantage
of
their
family
they
desecrate
the
word
love
love
is
for
us
paul
who
came
together
because
our
beings
cried
is
my
mate
i
should
say
nothing
of
it
oh
no
if
it
had
no
pretence
marriage
if
it
were
frankly
a
contract
i
give
you
my
body
and
my
dowry
you
give
me
your
name
and
your
state
it
is
of
the
coarse
horrible
things
one
must
pass
through
in
life
but
to
call
the
great
spirit
blessing
upon
it
as
an
exaltation
to
stand
there
and
talk
of
love
ah
that
is
what
must
make
god
angry
and
i
feel
for
him
paul
noticed
that
she
spoke
as
if
she
had
no
realisation
of
the
lives
of
lesser
persons
who
might
possibly
wed
because
they
were
mated
as
well
not
for
political
reasons
or
ambition
of
family
her
keen
senses
divined
his
thought
yes
beloved
you
would
say
only
that
supposing
you
were
not
married
to
any
one
else
we
should
be
swearing
the
truth
if
we
swore
before
god
that
we
loved
i
would
make
any
vows
to
you
from
my
soul
in
perfect
honesty
for
ever
and
ever
my
darling
queen
his
blue
eyes
brimming
with
devotion
and
conviction
of
the
truth
of
his
thought
gazed
up
at
her
and
into
her
strange
orbs
there
came
that
same
look
of
tenderness
that
once
before
had
made
them
as
a
mother
watching
the
gambols
of
her
babe
there
there
she
said
you
would
swear
them
and
hug
your
chains
of
roses
but
because
they
were
chains
they
would
turn
heavy
as
lead
make
no
vows
sweetheart
fate
will
force
you
to
break
them
if
you
do
and
then
the
gods
are
angry
and
misfortune
follows
swear
none
and
that
fickle
one
will
keep
you
passionate
in
hopes
always
to
lure
you
into
her
pitfalls
to
vow
and
to
break
pain
and
regret
live
live
paul
and
love
and
swear
nothing
at
all
paul
was
troubled
but
but
he
said
do
you
believe
i
shall
love
you
for
ever
the
lady
leant
back
against
the
rock
and
narrowed
her
eyes
that
will
depend
upon
me
my
paul
she
said
the
duration
of
love
in
a
being
always
depends
upon
the
loved
one
i
create
an
emotion
in
you
as
you
create
one
in
me
you
do
not
create
it
in
yourself
it
is
because
something
in
my
personality
causes
an
answering
glow
in
yours
that
you
love
me
were
you
to
cease
to
do
so
it
would
be
because
i
was
no
longer
able
to
call
forth
that
answer
in
you
it
would
not
be
your
fault
any
more
than
when
you
cease
to
please
me
it
will
be
mine
that
is
where
people
are
unjust
but
surely
said
paul
it
is
only
the
fickle
who
can
change
it
is
according
to
one
nature
if
one
is
born
a
steadfast
gentleman
one
is
more
likely
to
continue
than
if
one
is
a
prince
or
no
but
it
depends
upon
the
object
of
one
love
whether
he
or
she
can
hold
one
or
not
one
would
not
blame
a
needle
if
it
fell
from
a
magnet
the
attraction
of
the
magnet
being
in
some
way
removed
either
by
a
stronger
at
the
needle
side
or
by
some
deadening
of
the
drawing
quality
in
the
magnet
itself
and
so
it
is
in
love
do
you
follow
me
paul
yes
said
paul
gloomily
i
must
try
to
please
you
or
you
will
throw
me
away
you
see
she
continued
the
ignorant
make
vows
and
being
weaklings
for
the
most
part
vanity
and
fate
easily
remove
their
inclination
from
the
loved
one
it
may
not
be
his
fault
any
more
than
a
broken
leg
keeping
him
from
walking
would
be
his
fault
beyond
the
fact
that
it
was
leg
but
we
have
to
suffer
for
our
own
things
so
there
it
is
we
will
say
the
weakling
inclination
wants
to
make
him
break
his
vows
so
he
does
either
in
the
letter
or
spirit
or
both
and
then
he
feels
degraded
and
cheap
and
low
as
all
must
do
who
break
their
sacred
word
given
of
their
own
free
will
when
inclination
prompted
them
to
so
how
much
better
to
make
no
vow
then
at
least
when
the
cord
of
attraction
snaps
we
can
go
free
still
defying
the
lightning
in
our
untarnished
pride
oh
darling
do
not
speak
of
it
cried
paul
the
cord
of
attraction
between
us
can
never
snap
i
worship
i
adore
you
you
are
just
my
life
my
darling
one
my
queen
sweet
paul
she
whispered
oh
so
good
so
good
is
love
keep
me
loving
you
my
beautiful
one
keep
my
desire
long
to
be
your
queen
and
after
this
they
melted
into
one
another
arms
and
cooed
and
kissed
and
were
foolish
and
incoherent
as
lovers
always
are
and
have
been
from
the
beginning
of
old
time
more
concentrated
more
absorbed
than
the
sternest
eastern
sage
absorbed
in
each
other
the
spirit
of
two
natures
vibrating
as
one
chapter
x
that
evening
it
was
so
warm
and
peaceful
they
dined
at
the
balcony
windows
they
could
see
far
away
over
the
terrace
and
down
to
the
lake
with
the
distant
lights
towards
lucerne
the
moon
still
slender
and
fine
was
drawing
to
her
setting
and
a
few
cloudlets
floated
over
the
sky
obscuring
the
stars
here
and
there
the
lady
was
quiet
and
tender
her
eyes
melting
upon
paul
and
something
of
her
mood
was
upon
her
again
not
once
since
they
had
been
on
the
bürgenstock
had
she
shown
any
of
the
tigerish
waywardness
that
he
had
had
glimpses
of
at
first
it
seemed
as
if
her
moods
like
her
chameleon
eyes
took
colour
from
her
surroundings
and
there
all
was
primitive
simplicity
and
nature
and
peace
paul
himself
was
in
a
state
of
ecstasy
he
hardly
knew
whether
he
trod
on
air
or
no
no
siren
of
old
greek
fable
had
ever
lured
mortal
more
under
her
spell
than
this
strange
foreign
woman
thing
queen
or
princess
or
what
you
will
nothing
else
in
the
world
was
of
any
consequence
to
him
and
it
was
all
the
more
remarkable
because
subjection
was
in
no
way
part
of
his
nature
paul
was
a
masterful
youth
and
ruled
things
to
his
will
in
his
own
home
the
lady
talked
of
him
of
his
tastes
of
his
pleasures
there
was
not
an
incident
in
his
life
or
of
his
family
that
she
had
not
fathomed
by
now
all
about
isabella
even
poor
isabella
and
she
told
him
how
she
sympathised
with
the
girl
and
how
badly
he
had
behaved
another
proof
my
paul
of
what
i
said
today
no
one
must
make
vows
about
love
but
paul
in
his
heart
believed
her
not
he
would
worship
her
for
ever
he
knew
yes
she
said
answering
his
thoughts
you
think
so
beloved
and
it
may
be
so
because
you
do
not
know
from
moment
to
moment
how
i
shall
be
if
i
shall
stay
here
in
your
arms
or
fly
far
away
beyond
your
reach
you
love
me
because
i
give
you
the
stimulus
of
uncertainty
and
so
keep
bright
your
passion
but
once
you
were
sure
i
should
become
a
duty
as
all
women
become
and
then
my
paul
would
yawn
and
grow
to
see
i
was
no
longer
young
and
that
the
expected
is
always
an
when
it
comes
never
never
said
paul
with
fervour
presently
their
conversation
drifted
to
other
things
and
paul
told
her
how
he
longed
to
see
the
world
and
its
people
and
its
ways
she
had
been
almost
everywhere
it
seemed
and
with
her
talent
of
she
took
him
with
her
on
the
magic
carpet
of
her
vivid
description
to
east
and
west
and
north
and
south
oh
their
between
the
incoherence
of
just
lovers
love
were
not
banal
or
dull
and
never
she
forgot
her
tender
ways
of
insinuated
caresses
small
exquisite
touches
of
sentiment
and
grace
the
note
ever
of
one
that
they
were
fused
and
melted
together
into
one
body
and
soul
through
all
her
talk
that
night
paul
caught
glimpses
of
the
life
of
a
great
lady
surrounded
with
state
and
cares
and
now
and
then
there
was
a
savage
echo
which
made
him
think
of
things
barbaric
and
wonder
more
than
ever
from
whence
she
had
come
it
was
quite
late
before
the
chill
of
night
airs
drove
them
into
their
salon
and
here
she
made
him
some
russian
tea
and
then
lay
in
his
arms
and
purred
to
him
and
nestled
close
like
a
child
who
wants
petting
to
cure
it
of
some
imaginary
hurt
only
in
her
tenderest
caresses
he
seemed
at
last
to
feel
something
of
danger
a
slumbering
look
of
passion
far
under
the
calm
exterior
but
ready
to
break
forth
at
any
moment
from
its
studied
control
it
thrilled
and
maddened
him
beloved
beloved
he
cried
let
us
waste
no
more
precious
moments
i
want
you
i
want
you
my
sweet
at
the
first
glow
of
dawn
he
awoke
a
strange
sensation
almost
of
strangling
and
suffocation
upon
him
there
bending
over
framed
in
a
mist
of
waves
he
saw
his
lady
face
its
milky
whiteness
lit
by
her
strange
eyes
green
as
cats
they
seemed
and
blazing
with
the
fiercest
passion
of
love
while
twisted
round
his
throat
he
felt
a
great
strand
of
her
splendid
hair
the
wildest
thrill
as
yet
his
life
had
known
then
came
to
paul
he
clasped
her
in
his
arms
with
a
frenzy
of
mad
passionate
joy
chapter
xi
the
next
day
was
sunday
and
even
through
the
silk
blinds
they
could
hear
the
rain
drip
in
monotonous
fashion
of
what
use
to
wake
sleep
is
blissful
and
calm
when
the
loved
one
is
near
thus
it
was
late
when
paul
at
last
opened
his
eyes
he
found
himself
alone
and
heard
his
lady
voice
singing
softly
from
the
beyond
and
through
the
open
door
he
could
perceive
her
stretched
on
the
tiger
already
dressed
reclining
among
the
silk
pillows
her
guitar
held
in
her
hands
hasten
hasten
lazy
one
thy
breakfast
awaits
thee
she
called
and
paul
bounded
up
without
further
delay
this
day
was
to
be
a
day
of
books
she
said
and
she
read
poetry
to
him
and
made
him
read
to
her
but
she
would
not
permit
him
to
sit
too
near
her
or
caress
her
and
often
she
was
restless
and
moved
about
with
the
undulating
grace
of
a
cat
she
would
peep
from
the
windows
and
frown
at
the
scene
the
lake
was
hidden
by
mist
the
skies
cried
all
nature
was
weeping
and
gloomy
and
at
last
she
flung
the
books
aside
and
crept
up
to
paul
who
was
huddled
on
the
sofa
feeling
rather
morose
from
her
decree
that
he
must
not
touch
or
kiss
her
weeping
skies
i
hate
you
she
said
then
she
called
dmitry
in
a
sharp
voice
and
when
he
appeared
from
the
passage
where
he
always
awaited
her
pleasure
she
spoke
to
him
in
russian
or
some
language
paul
knew
not
a
fierce
gleam
in
her
eyes
dmitry
abased
himself
almost
to
the
floor
and
departing
quickly
returned
with
sticks
and
lit
a
blazing
fire
in
the
open
grate
then
he
threw
some
powder
into
it
and
with
stealthy
haste
drew
all
the
curtains
and
departed
from
the
room
a
strange
divine
scent
presently
rose
in
the
air
and
over
paul
seemed
to
steal
a
spell
the
lady
crept
still
nearer
and
then
with
infinite
sweetness
all
her
docility
of
the
first
hours
of
their
union
returned
she
melted
in
his
arms
paul
i
am
so
wayward
forgive
me
she
said
in
a
childish
lisping
voice
see
i
will
make
you
forget
the
rain
and
damp
fly
with
me
to
egypt
where
the
sun
always
shines
and
paul
like
a
sulky
hungry
baby
who
had
been
debarred
and
now
received
its
expected
sweetmeat
clasped
her
and
kissed
her
for
a
few
minutes
before
he
would
let
her
speak
see
we
are
getting
near
cairo
she
said
her
eyes
half
closed
while
she
settled
herself
among
the
cushions
and
drew
paul
down
to
her
until
his
head
rested
on
her
breast
and
her
arms
held
him
like
a
mother
with
a
child
her
voice
was
a
as
she
whispered
on
do
you
not
love
those
minarets
and
towers
against
the
opal
sky
and
the
granite
hills
beyond
and
look
paul
at
this
peep
of
the
nile
those
are
the
those
strange
beasts
you
see
they
are
pulling
that
ridiculous
just
the
same
as
in
pharaoh
time
ah
i
smell
the
scent
of
the
east
look
at
the
straight
blue
figures
the
lines
so
pleasing
and
long
the
dignity
the
peace
the
forever
in
it
all
now
we
are
there
see
the
brilliant
crowd
all
moving
with
little
haste
and
listen
to
the
strange
noise
look
at
the
faces
of
the
camels
disdainful
and
calm
and
that
of
an
old
with
tangled
hair
come
come
from
this
i
want
the
desert
and
the
sphinx
ah
it
is
bright
day
again
and
we
have
all
the
green
world
between
us
and
the
great
vast
brown
tract
of
sand
and
those
are
the
pyramids
against
the
turquoise
sky
and
soon
we
shall
be
there
only
you
must
observe
this
green
around
us
first
my
paul
the
green
of
no
other
country
in
all
the
world
pure
emerald
nature
supreme
concentrated
effort
of
green
for
miles
and
miles
no
i
do
not
want
to
live
in
that
small
village
in
a
brown
mud
hut
shared
with
another
wife
to
that
gaunt
blue
man
i
would
kill
them
all
and
be
free
i
want
to
go
on
beloved
on
to
the
desert
for
you
and
me
alone
with
its
wonderful
passion
and
wonderful
peace
her
voice
became
still
more
dreamy
there
was
a
cadence
in
it
now
as
if
some
soul
within
were
forcing
her
to
chant
it
all
with
almost
the
lilt
of
blank
verse
oh
the
strange
drug
of
the
glorious
east
flooding
your
senses
with
beauty
and
life
is
the
spell
of
the
sphinx
and
now
we
are
there
close
in
her
presence
look
the
sun
has
set
hush
hush
beloved
we
are
alone
the
camels
and
guides
afar
off
we
are
alone
sweetheart
and
we
go
on
together
you
and
i
and
the
moon
see
she
is
rising
all
silver
and
pure
and
blue
is
the
sky
and
scented
the
night
look
there
is
the
sphinx
do
you
see
the
strange
mystery
of
her
smile
and
the
glamour
of
her
eyes
she
is
a
goddess
and
she
knows
men
souls
and
their
foolish
unavailing
passion
and
pain
never
content
with
the
which
they
have
always
regretting
the
which
has
passed
and
building
false
hopes
on
the
phantom
but
you
and
i
my
lover
my
sweet
have
fathomed
the
riddle
which
is
hid
in
the
smile
of
our
goddess
our
sphinx
we
have
guessed
it
and
now
are
as
high
gods
too
for
we
know
it
means
to
live
in
the
present
and
quaff
life
in
its
full
sweetheart
beloved
joy
and
life
in
its
full
her
voice
grew
faint
and
far
away
like
the
echo
of
some
exquisite
song
and
the
lids
closed
over
paul
blue
eyes
and
he
slept
the
light
of
all
the
love
in
the
world
seemed
to
flood
the
lady
face
she
bent
over
and
kissed
him
and
smoothed
his
cheek
with
her
velvet
cheek
she
moved
so
that
his
curly
lashes
might
touch
her
bare
neck
and
at
last
she
slipped
from
under
him
and
laid
his
head
gently
down
upon
the
pillows
then
a
madness
of
tender
caressing
seized
her
she
purred
as
a
tiger
might
have
done
while
she
undulated
like
a
snake
she
touched
him
with
her
she
kissed
his
throat
his
wrists
the
palms
of
his
hands
his
eyelids
his
hair
strange
subtle
kisses
unlike
the
kisses
of
women
and
often
between
her
purrings
she
murmured
in
some
strange
fierce
language
of
her
own
brushing
his
ears
and
his
eyes
with
her
lips
the
while
and
through
it
all
paul
slept
on
the
eastern
perfume
in
the
air
still
drugging
his
sense
it
was
quite
dark
when
he
awoke
again
and
beside
him
seated
on
the
floor
all
propped
with
pillows
his
lady
reclined
her
head
against
his
shoulder
and
as
he
looked
down
at
her
in
the
firelight
flickering
gleam
he
saw
that
her
wonderful
eyes
were
wet
with
great
glittering
tears
my
soul
my
soul
he
said
tenderly
his
heart
wrung
with
emotion
what
is
it
sweetheart
why
have
you
these
tears
oh
what
have
i
done
darling
my
own
i
am
weary
she
said
and
fell
to
weeping
softly
and
refused
to
be
comforted
paul
distress
was
intense
what
could
have
happened
what
terrible
thing
had
he
done
what
sorrow
had
fallen
upon
his
beloved
while
he
selfishly
slept
but
all
she
would
say
was
that
she
was
weary
while
she
clung
to
him
in
a
storm
of
passion
as
if
some
one
threatened
to
take
her
out
of
his
arms
then
she
left
him
abruptly
and
went
off
to
dress
but
later
at
dinner
it
seemed
as
if
a
new
and
more
radiant
light
than
ever
glowed
on
her
face
she
was
gay
and
caressing
telling
him
merry
tales
of
paris
and
its
plays
it
was
as
if
she
meant
to
efface
all
suggestion
of
sorrow
or
pain
and
gradually
the
impression
wore
off
in
paul
mind
and
ere
it
came
to
their
sipping
the
golden
wine
all
was
brightness
and
peace
see
she
said
looking
from
the
window
just
before
they
retired
to
rest
the
sky
has
stopped
crying
and
there
are
our
stars
sweetheart
come
out
to
wish
us
ah
for
us
tomorrow
once
more
will
be
a
glorious
day
my
queen
said
paul
rain
or
fine
all
days
are
glorious
to
me
so
long
as
i
have
you
to
clasp
in
my
arms
you
are
my
sun
moon
and
stars
always
for
ever
she
laughed
a
laugh
the
silver
echo
of
satisfaction
and
joy
sweet
paul
she
lisped
mischievously
so
good
you
have
been
so
gentle
with
my
moods
you
must
have
some
reward
listen
beloved
while
i
tell
it
to
you
but
what
she
said
is
written
in
his
heart
chapter
xii
his
lady
was
so
intensely
that
is
what
pleased
paul
he
had
never
thought
about
such
things
or
noticed
them
much
in
other
women
but
she
was
a
revelation
no
roman
empress
with
her
bath
of
asses
milk
could
have
had
a
more
wonderful
toilet
than
she
and
ever
she
was
illusive
and
he
never
quite
got
to
the
end
of
her
mystery
always
there
was
a
veil
when
he
least
expected
it
and
so
these
hours
for
the
most
part
were
passed
at
the
of
excitement
and
bliss
the
experiences
of
another
whole
lifetime
paul
was
going
through
in
the
space
of
days
it
was
the
monday
following
the
wet
sunday
when
an
incident
happened
which
soon
came
back
to
him
and
gave
him
food
for
reflection
they
would
spend
the
day
in
the
launch
she
decided
going
whither
they
wished
stopping
here
to
pick
gentians
going
there
under
the
shadow
of
trees
landing
where
and
when
they
desired
even
sleeping
at
flüclen
if
the
fancy
took
them
to
anna
was
sent
on
with
their
things
in
case
this
contingency
occurred
and
earth
water
and
sky
seemed
smiling
them
a
welcome
just
before
they
started
dmitry
after
the
gentlest
tap
noiselessly
entered
paul
room
paul
was
selecting
some
cigars
from
a
box
and
looked
up
in
surprise
as
the
stately
servant
cautiously
closed
the
door
yes
dmitry
what
is
it
he
said
half
impatiently
dmitry
advanced
and
now
paul
saw
that
he
carried
something
in
his
hand
he
bowed
low
with
his
usual
courtly
respect
then
he
stammered
a
little
as
he
began
to
speak
the
substance
of
his
sentence
paul
gathered
was
that
the
excellency
would
not
be
inconveniencing
himself
too
much
he
hoped
if
he
would
consent
to
carry
this
pistol
a
very
good
pistol
he
assured
him
which
would
take
but
little
room
paul
surprise
deepened
carry
a
pistol
in
peaceful
switzerland
it
seemed
too
absurd
what
on
earth
for
my
friend
he
said
but
dmitry
would
give
no
decided
answer
only
that
it
was
wiser
when
away
from
one
home
and
out
with
a
lady
never
to
go
unarmed
real
anxiety
peeped
from
his
cautious
grey
eyes
did
paul
know
how
to
shoot
and
would
he
be
pardoned
for
asking
the
excellency
such
a
question
but
in
england
he
heard
they
dealt
little
with
revolvers
and
this
was
a
point
to
be
assured
of
yes
paul
knew
how
to
shoot
the
idea
made
him
laugh
but
now
he
came
to
think
of
it
he
had
not
had
great
practice
with
a
revolver
and
might
not
do
so
well
as
with
a
gun
or
rifle
but
the
whole
thing
seemed
so
absurd
he
did
not
think
it
of
much
consequence
of
course
i
take
it
to
please
you
dmitry
he
said
though
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
why
however
dmitry
escaped
from
the
room
without
further
words
his
finger
upon
his
lips
the
lady
was
looking
more
exquisitely
white
than
usual
she
wore
soft
pale
mauve
and
appeared
in
paul
eyes
a
thing
of
joy
when
they
were
seated
on
the
launch
in
their
chairs
she
let
him
hold
her
hand
but
she
did
not
talk
much
at
first
only
now
he
understood
her
silences
and
did
not
worry
over
them
so
great
a
teacher
is
love
to
quicken
the
perception
of
man
he
sat
there
and
gazed
at
her
and
tried
to
realise
that
it
was
really
he
who
was
experiencing
all
this
happiness
this
wonderful
wonderful
woman
and
he
was
her
lover
at
last
something
in
her
expression
of
sadness
caught
his
watchful
eye
and
an
ache
came
into
his
mind
to
know
where
hers
had
gone
darling
he
said
tenderly
may
i
come
there
too
she
turned
towards
him
a
shadow
was
in
her
eyes
no
paul
she
said
not
there
it
is
a
land
of
rocks
and
precipices
not
for
lovers
but
if
you
can
go
where
is
the
danger
for
me
my
queen
or
if
there
is
danger
then
it
is
my
place
to
stand
by
your
side
paul
my
sweet
paul
she
whispered
while
her
eyes
filled
with
mist
i
was
thinking
how
fair
the
world
could
be
perhaps
if
fate
allowed
one
to
meet
one
mate
while
there
was
yet
time
surely
two
souls
together
like
you
and
i
might
climb
to
paradise
doing
deeds
of
greatness
by
the
way
but
so
much
of
life
is
like
a
rushing
torrent
tearing
along
making
a
course
for
itself
without
power
to
choose
through
what
country
it
will
pass
until
it
meets
the
ocean
and
is
swallowed
up
and
lost
if
one
could
only
see
only
know
in
time
could
he
change
the
course
alas
who
can
tell
her
voice
was
sad
and
as
ever
it
wrung
paul
heart
my
darling
one
he
said
do
think
of
those
odd
things
only
remember
that
i
am
here
beside
you
and
that
i
love
you
love
you
so
my
paul
she
murmured
and
she
smiled
a
strange
sweet
smile
do
you
know
i
find
you
like
a
rare
violin
which
hitherto
has
been
used
by
ordinary
musicians
to
play
their
popular
airs
upon
but
which
is
now
highly
strung
and
being
touched
by
the
bow
of
an
artist
who
loves
it
and
oh
the
exquisite
sounds
which
are
coming
and
will
yet
come
forth
to
enchant
the
ear
and
satisfy
the
sense
all
the
capacity
is
there
paul
in
you
beautiful
one
only
i
must
bring
it
out
with
my
bow
of
love
and
what
a
progress
you
have
made
already
a
great
great
progress
think
only
a
few
days
ago
you
had
never
noticed
the
colours
of
this
lake
or
even
these
great
mountains
they
said
nothing
to
you
at
all
except
as
places
to
take
your
exercise
upon
life
for
you
was
just
eating
and
sleeping
and
strengthening
your
muscles
and
she
laughed
softly
i
know
i
was
a
goth
said
paul
i
can
hardly
realise
it
myself
the
change
that
has
happened
to
me
everything
now
seems
full
of
joy
your
very
phrases
are
altered
paul
and
will
alter
more
yet
while
our
moon
waxes
and
our
love
grows
can
it
grow
can
i
possibly
love
you
more
intensely
than
i
do
now
surely
no
he
exclaimed
passionately
and
yet
and
yet
ah
yes
i
know
it
yes
it
can
grow
until
it
is
my
life
my
very
life
yes
paul
she
said
your
life
and
her
strange
eyes
narrowed
again
the
sphinx
inscrutable
look
of
mystery
in
their
chameleon
depths
then
her
mood
altered
she
became
gay
and
laughing
and
her
wit
sparkled
like
dry
champagne
while
the
white
launch
glided
through
the
blue
waters
with
never
a
swirl
of
foam
paul
she
said
presently
we
will
go
up
the
rigi
to
the
kaltbad
and
look
from
the
little
kiosk
over
the
world
and
over
the
bernese
oberland
it
gives
me
an
emotion
to
stand
so
high
and
see
so
vast
a
view
but
we
will
play
on
the
water
and
among
the
trees
he
had
no
desires
except
to
do
what
she
would
do
so
they
landed
for
lunch
at
one
of
the
many
little
inviting
hotels
which
border
the
lake
in
sheltered
bays
all
through
the
meal
she
entertained
him
with
subtle
flattery
drawing
him
out
and
making
him
shine
until
he
made
flint
for
her
steel
and
when
they
came
to
the
end
she
said
with
sudden
tender
sweetness
paul
it
is
my
caprice
you
may
pay
the
bill
just
for
because
ah
you
must
guess
my
paul
the
reason
why
and
she
ran
out
into
the
sunlight
her
cheeks
bright
pink
but
paul
knew
it
was
because
now
she
to
him
his
heart
swelled
with
joy
and
who
so
proud
as
he
she
had
gone
alone
up
a
mountain
path
when
he
came
out
to
join
her
and
stood
there
laughing
at
him
provokingly
from
above
he
bounded
up
and
caught
her
and
would
walk
hand
in
hand
and
made
her
feel
that
he
was
master
and
lord
through
the
strength
of
his
splendid
vigorous
youth
he
pretended
to
scold
her
if
she
stirred
from
him
and
made
her
stand
or
walk
and
obey
him
and
gave
himself
the
airs
of
a
husband
and
prince
and
the
lady
laughed
in
pure
ecstatic
joy
oh
i
love
you
my
paul
like
this
like
this
beautiful
one
just
a
splendid
primitive
savage
beneath
the
grace
as
a
man
should
be
when
i
feel
how
strong
you
are
my
heart
melts
with
bliss
and
paul
to
show
her
it
was
true
seized
her
in
his
arms
and
ran
with
her
placing
her
on
a
high
rock
where
he
made
her
pay
him
with
kisses
and
tell
him
she
loved
him
before
he
would
lift
her
down
and
it
was
his
lady
caprice
as
she
said
that
this
state
of
things
should
last
all
day
but
by
night
time
when
they
got
to
flüelen
the
infinite
mastery
of
her
mind
and
the
uncertainty
of
his
hold
over
her
made
her
his
queen
again
and
paul
once
more
her
worshipping
slave
now
although
his
master
was
quite
oblivious
of
posts
tompson
was
not
and
that
monday
he
took
occasion
to
go
into
lucerne
whence
he
returned
with
a
pile
of
letters
which
paul
found
on
again
reaching
the
bürgenstock
after
staying
the
night
at
flüelen
in
a
little
hotel
that
had
been
an
experience
his
lady
quite
childish
in
her
glee
at
the
smallness
and
simplicity
of
everything
our
picnic
she
called
it
to
paul
only
it
was
a
wonderfully
picnic
as
anna
of
course
had
brought
everything
which
was
required
by
heart
of
sybarite
for
the
passing
of
a
night
ah
they
had
been
happy
the
queen
had
been
exquisitely
gracious
to
her
slave
and
entranced
him
more
deeply
than
ever
and
here
at
the
bürgenstock
when
he
got
into
his
room
his
letters
stared
him
in
the
face
damned
officiousness
he
said
to
himself
thinking
of
tompson
he
did
not
want
to
be
reminded
of
any
existence
other
than
the
dream
of
heaven
he
was
now
enjoying
oh
they
were
all
very
real
and
material
these
epistles
quite
of
earth
one
was
from
his
mother
he
was
enjoying
lucerne
she
hoped
and
she
was
longing
for
his
return
she
expected
he
also
was
craving
for
his
home
and
horses
and
dogs
all
were
well
they
she
and
his
father
were
moving
up
to
the
town
house
in
berkeley
square
the
following
week
until
the
end
of
june
and
great
preparations
were
already
in
contemplation
for
his
birthday
in
july
at
verdayne
place
there
was
no
mention
of
isabella
except
a
paragraph
at
the
end
miss
waring
was
visiting
friends
at
blackheath
he
was
informed
ah
so
far
away
it
all
seemed
but
it
brought
him
back
from
heaven
the
next
was
his
father
writing
laconic
but
to
the
point
this
parent
hoped
he
was
not
wasting
his
time
d
d
short
in
life
and
that
he
was
cured
of
his
folly
for
the
parson
girl
and
found
other
eyes
shone
bright
if
he
wanted
more
money
he
was
to
say
so
several
were
from
his
friends
banal
and
everyday
and
one
was
from
tremlett
his
own
groom
and
this
was
full
of
moonlighter
and
pike
that
gave
him
just
a
moment
feeling
pike
tremlett
had
made
so
bold
as
to
have
some
snapshots
done
by
a
friend
and
he
ventured
to
send
one
to
his
master
the
very
pictur
of
the
dog
he
said
and
it
was
true
ah
this
touched
him
this
little
photograph
of
pike
dear
little
chap
he
said
to
himself
as
he
looked
my
dear
little
chap
and
then
an
instantaneous
desire
to
show
it
to
his
lady
came
over
him
and
he
went
back
to
the
in
haste
there
she
was
the
post
had
come
for
her
too
it
seemed
and
she
looked
up
with
an
expression
of
concentrated
fierceness
from
a
missive
she
was
reading
as
he
entered
the
room
her
marvellous
banished
all
but
love
from
her
eyes
after
they
had
rested
on
him
for
an
instant
but
his
senses
so
fine
now
had
remarked
the
first
glance
just
as
his
eye
had
seen
the
heavy
royal
crown
on
the
paper
as
she
hastily
folded
it
and
threw
it
carelessly
aside
darling
he
said
oh
look
here
is
a
picture
of
pike
and
if
it
had
been
the
most
important
document
concerning
the
fate
of
nations
the
lady
could
not
have
examined
it
with
more
enthralled
interest
and
attention
than
she
did
this
snapshot
photograph
of
a
rough
terrier
dog
what
a
sweet
fellow
she
said
look
at
his
eye
so
intelligent
look
at
that
see
even
he
is
asking
one
to
love
him
and
i
do
i
do
darling
said
paul
in
ecstasy
oh
if
we
only
had
him
here
that
be
good
and
he
never
knew
why
his
lady
suddenly
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
with
passionate
tenderness
and
love
her
eyes
soft
as
a
dove
oh
my
paul
she
said
a
break
in
her
wonderful
voice
whose
tones
said
many
things
my
young
darling
english
paul
presently
they
would
drive
to
see
that
quaint
farm
she
wanted
to
show
him
the
day
was
very
warm
and
to
rest
in
the
comfortable
carriage
would
be
nice
paul
thought
so
too
so
after
a
late
lunch
they
started
and
once
or
twice
on
the
drive
through
the
most
peaceful
and
beautiful
scenery
a
flash
of
the
same
fierceness
came
into
the
lady
eyes
gazing
away
over
distance
as
when
she
had
read
her
letter
and
it
made
paul
wonder
and
long
to
ask
her
why
he
never
allowed
himself
to
speculate
in
coherent
thought
words
even
as
to
who
she
was
or
her
abode
in
life
he
had
given
his
word
and
was
an
englishman
and
would
keep
it
that
was
all
but
in
his
subconsciousness
there
dwelt
the
conviction
that
she
must
be
some
queen
or
princess
of
a
country
south
in
europe
half
barbaric
half
advanced
that
she
was
unhappy
and
hated
it
all
he
more
than
divined
it
was
a
proof
of
the
strength
of
his
character
that
he
did
not
let
the
terrible
thought
of
inevitable
parting
mar
the
bliss
of
the
tangible
now
he
had
promised
her
to
live
while
the
sun
of
their
union
shone
and
he
had
the
force
to
keep
his
word
but
oh
he
wished
he
could
drive
all
care
from
her
path
and
that
this
glorious
life
should
go
on
for
ever
when
they
got
to
the
farm
in
the
soft
late
afternoon
light
the
most
gracious
mood
came
over
his
lady
it
was
just
a
swiss
farmhouse
of
many
storeys
the
lower
one
for
the
cows
and
other
animals
and
the
rest
for
the
family
and
industries
all
was
clean
and
in
order
with
that
wonderful
outside
neatness
which
makes
swiss
châlets
look
like
painted
toy
houses
popped
down
on
the
greensward
without
yard
or
byre
and
these
people
were
and
it
was
the
best
of
its
kind
the
a
buxom
mother
of
many
little
ones
was
nursing
another
not
four
weeks
old
a
fat
prosperous
infant
in
its
quaint
swiss
clothes
her
broad
face
beamed
with
pride
as
she
welcomed
the
gracious
lady
old
acquaintances
they
appeared
and
they
exchanged
greetings
foreign
languages
were
not
paul
strong
point
and
he
caught
not
a
word
of
meaning
in
the
german
the
good
woman
talked
but
his
lady
was
voluble
and
seemed
to
know
each
child
by
name
though
it
was
the
infant
which
longest
arrested
her
attention
she
held
it
in
her
arms
and
paul
had
never
seen
her
look
so
young
or
so
beautiful
the
good
woman
left
them
alone
while
she
prepared
some
coffee
for
them
in
the
adjoining
kitchen
followed
by
her
troop
of
only
the
little
one
still
lay
in
the
lady
arms
she
spoke
not
a
word
she
sang
to
it
a
and
the
thought
came
to
paul
that
she
seemed
as
an
angel
and
this
must
be
an
echo
of
his
own
early
heaven
before
his
life
had
descended
to
earth
a
strange
peace
came
over
him
as
he
sat
there
watching
her
his
thoughts
vague
and
dreamy
of
some
beautiful
sweet
tenderness
he
knew
not
what
ere
the
woman
returned
with
the
coffee
the
lady
looked
up
from
her
crooning
and
met
his
eyes
all
her
soul
was
aglow
in
hers
while
she
whispered
as
he
bent
over
to
meet
her
lips
yes
some
day
my
sweetheart
yes
and
that
magic
current
of
sympathy
which
was
between
them
made
paul
know
what
she
meant
and
the
gladness
of
the
gods
fell
upon
him
and
exalted
him
and
his
blue
eyes
swam
with
tears
ah
that
was
a
thought
if
that
could
ever
be
all
the
way
back
in
the
carriage
he
could
only
kiss
her
their
emotion
seemed
too
deep
for
words
and
this
night
was
the
most
divine
of
any
they
had
spent
on
the
bürgenstock
but
there
was
in
it
an
essence
about
which
only
the
angels
could
write
chapter
xiii
do
you
know
the
belvedere
at
the
rigi
kaltbad
looking
over
the
corner
to
a
vast
world
below
on
a
fair
day
in
may
when
the
air
is
clear
as
crystal
and
the
lake
when
the
bernese
oberland
undulates
away
in
unbroken
snow
its
pure
whiteness
like
cold
marble
the
shadows
have
you
seen
the
tints
of
the
beeches
of
the
pines
of
the
firs
clinging
like
some
cloak
of
life
to
the
mountains
a
reminder
that
spring
is
eternal
and
youth
must
have
its
day
however
grey
beards
and
white
heads
may
frown
ah
it
is
good
and
so
is
the
air
up
there
hungry
and
strong
and
young
paul
and
his
lady
stood
and
looked
down
in
rapt
silence
it
was
giving
her
as
she
said
an
emotion
but
of
what
sort
he
was
not
sure
they
were
all
alone
no
living
soul
was
anywhere
in
view
she
had
been
in
a
mood
all
day
when
she
seldom
raised
her
eyes
it
reminded
him
of
the
first
time
he
had
seen
her
and
wonder
grew
again
in
his
mind
all
the
last
night
her
soul
had
seemed
melted
into
his
in
a
fusion
of
tenderness
and
trust
exalted
with
the
exquisite
thought
of
the
wish
which
was
between
them
and
he
had
felt
at
last
he
had
fathomed
its
inmost
recess
but
as
he
gazed
down
at
her
paleness
the
heavy
lashes
making
their
violet
shadow
on
her
cheek
her
red
mouth
mutinous
and
full
the
conviction
came
back
to
him
that
there
were
breadths
and
depths
and
heights
about
which
he
had
no
conception
even
and
an
ice
hand
clutched
his
heart
of
what
strange
thing
was
she
thinking
leaning
over
the
parapet
there
her
delicate
nostrils
quivering
now
and
then
paul
she
said
at
last
did
you
ever
want
to
kill
any
one
did
you
ever
long
to
have
them
there
at
your
mercy
to
choke
their
life
out
and
throw
them
to
hell
good
god
no
said
paul
aghast
then
at
last
she
looked
up
at
him
and
her
eyes
were
black
with
hate
well
i
do
paul
i
would
like
to
kill
one
man
on
earth
a
useless
vicious
weakling
too
feeble
to
deserve
a
fine
death
a
rotting
carrion
spoiling
god
world
and
encumbering
my
path
i
would
kill
him
if
i
could
and
more
than
ever
today
oh
my
queen
my
queen
said
paul
distressed
do
say
such
things
you
my
own
tender
woman
and
love
yes
that
is
one
side
of
me
and
the
best
but
there
is
another
which
he
draws
forth
and
that
is
the
worst
you
of
calm
england
do
not
know
what
it
means
the
true
passion
of
hate
can
i
do
nothing
for
you
beloved
paul
asked
here
was
a
phase
which
he
had
not
yet
seen
ah
she
said
bitterly
and
threw
up
her
head
no
his
high
place
protects
him
but
for
his
life
i
would
conquer
all
fate
darling
darling
said
paul
who
knew
not
what
to
say
but
paul
if
a
hair
of
your
head
should
be
hurt
i
would
kill
him
myself
with
these
my
own
hands
once
paul
had
seen
two
tigers
fight
in
a
travelling
which
came
to
oxford
and
now
the
memory
of
the
scene
returned
to
him
when
he
looked
at
his
lady
face
he
had
not
known
a
human
countenance
could
express
such
fierce
terrible
rage
a
quiver
ran
through
him
yes
this
was
no
idle
boast
of
an
angry
woman
he
felt
those
slender
hands
would
indeed
be
capable
of
dealing
death
to
any
one
who
robbed
her
of
her
mate
but
what
passion
was
here
what
force
he
had
somehow
never
even
dreamt
such
feelings
dwelt
in
women
or
indeed
in
any
human
creatures
out
of
sensational
books
yet
gazing
there
at
her
he
dimly
understood
that
in
himself
too
they
could
rise
were
another
to
take
her
from
him
yes
he
could
kill
in
suchlike
case
they
were
silent
for
some
moments
each
vibrating
with
passionate
thoughts
and
then
the
lady
leant
over
and
laid
her
cheek
against
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
heart
of
my
heart
she
said
i
frighten
and
ruffle
you
the
women
of
your
country
are
sweet
and
soft
but
they
know
not
the
passion
i
know
my
paul
the
fierceness
and
madness
of
love
paul
clasped
her
in
his
arms
it
makes
me
worship
you
more
my
queen
he
said
englishwomen
would
seem
like
wax
dolls
now
beside
you
and
your
exquisite
face
they
will
never
again
be
anything
but
shadows
in
my
life
it
can
only
hold
you
the
one
goddess
and
queen
her
eyes
were
suffused
with
a
mist
of
tenderness
the
passion
was
gone
her
head
was
thrown
back
against
his
breast
when
suddenly
her
hand
inadvertently
touched
against
the
pocket
where
dmitry
pistol
lay
she
started
violently
and
before
he
could
divine
her
purpose
she
snatched
the
weapon
out
and
held
it
up
to
the
light
her
face
went
like
death
and
for
a
second
she
leant
against
the
parapet
as
if
she
were
going
to
faint
paul
she
gasped
with
white
lips
this
is
dmitry
pistol
i
know
it
well
how
did
you
come
by
it
tell
me
beloved
if
he
gave
it
to
you
then
it
means
danger
paul
danger
my
darling
said
paul
in
his
strong
young
pride
fear
nothing
i
shall
never
leave
you
i
will
protect
you
from
any
danger
in
the
world
only
depend
upon
me
sweetheart
nothing
can
hurt
you
while
i
am
here
do
you
think
i
care
a
for
my
life
she
said
while
she
stood
straight
up
again
with
the
majesty
of
a
queen
do
you
think
i
feared
for
me
for
myself
oh
no
my
own
lover
never
that
they
can
kill
me
when
they
choose
but
they
wo
it
is
you
for
whom
i
fear
only
your
danger
could
make
me
cower
no
other
in
the
whole
world
paul
laughed
with
joy
at
her
speech
there
is
nothing
to
fear
at
all
then
darling
he
said
i
can
take
care
of
myself
you
know
i
am
an
englishman
and
even
in
the
tumult
of
her
thoughts
the
lady
found
time
to
smile
with
tender
amusement
at
the
young
insular
arrogance
of
his
last
words
an
englishman
forsooth
of
course
that
meant
a
kind
of
god
untouched
by
the
failings
of
other
nations
a
great
rush
of
pride
in
him
came
over
her
and
gladdened
her
he
was
indeed
a
splendid
picture
of
youth
and
strength
as
he
stood
there
the
sunlight
gilding
his
fair
hair
and
all
the
magnificent
proportions
of
his
figure
thrown
into
relief
against
the
background
of
grey
stone
and
sky
an
smile
on
his
lips
and
all
the
light
of
love
and
in
his
fine
blue
eyes
she
responded
to
the
fire
in
them
and
appeared
to
grow
comforted
and
at
peace
but
all
the
way
back
through
the
wood
to
the
kalibad
hotel
she
glanced
furtively
into
the
shadows
while
she
talked
gaily
as
she
held
paul
arm
and
he
never
asked
her
a
question
as
to
where
she
expected
the
danger
to
come
from
no
anxiety
for
his
own
safety
troubled
him
one
jot
indeed
an
unwonted
extra
excitement
flooded
his
veins
making
him
enjoy
himself
with
an
added
zest
dmitry
as
usual
awaited
them
at
the
hotel
his
face
was
serene
but
when
paul
back
was
turned
for
a
moment
while
he
lit
a
cigarette
the
lady
questioned
her
servant
with
whispered
fierceness
in
the
russian
tongue
apparently
his
answer
was
satisfactory
for
she
looked
relieved
and
presently
seated
on
the
terrace
they
had
a
merry
tea
the
last
they
would
have
on
mountain
tops
for
she
broke
it
gently
to
paul
that
on
the
morrow
she
must
return
to
lucerne
paul
felt
as
if
his
heart
had
stopped
beating
return
to
lucerne
o
god
not
to
part
surely
not
to
part
so
soon
no
no
she
said
the
thought
making
her
whiten
too
oh
no
my
paul
not
that
yet
ah
he
could
bear
anything
if
it
did
not
mean
parting
and
he
used
no
arguments
to
dissuade
her
she
was
his
queen
and
must
surely
know
best
only
he
listened
eagerly
for
details
of
how
matters
could
be
arranged
there
alas
they
could
never
be
the
same
as
this
glorious
time
they
had
had
you
must
wait
two
days
sweetheart
she
said
before
you
follow
me
stay
still
in
our
nest
if
you
will
but
do
not
come
on
to
lucerne
i
could
not
stand
it
said
paul
oh
darling
do
kill
me
with
aching
for
your
presence
two
whole
days
it
is
a
lifetime
not
to
be
endured
impatient
one
she
laughed
softly
no
neither
could
i
bear
not
to
see
you
sweetheart
but
we
must
not
be
foolish
you
must
stay
on
in
our
rooms
and
each
morning
i
will
meet
you
somewhere
in
the
launch
dmitry
knows
every
inch
of
the
lake
and
we
can
pass
most
of
days
thus
happy
at
last
but
the
nights
said
paul
deep
distress
in
his
voice
what
on
earth
do
you
think
i
can
do
with
the
nights
spend
them
in
sleep
my
beloved
one
the
lady
said
while
she
smiled
a
soft
fine
smile
but
to
paul
this
idea
presented
the
poorest
compensation
and
in
spite
of
his
will
to
the
contrary
his
thoughts
flew
ahead
for
an
instant
to
the
inevitable
days
and
nights
when
ah
no
he
could
not
face
the
picture
life
would
be
finished
for
him
when
that
time
came
the
thought
of
only
a
temporary
parting
on
the
morrow
made
them
cling
together
for
this
their
last
evening
with
almost
greater
closeness
and
tenderness
than
usual
paul
could
hardly
bear
his
lady
out
of
his
sight
even
while
she
dressed
for
dinner
when
they
got
back
to
the
bürgenstock
and
twice
he
came
to
the
door
and
asked
plaintively
how
long
she
would
be
until
anna
took
pity
on
him
and
implored
to
be
allowed
to
ask
him
to
come
in
while
she
finished
her
mistress
hair
and
that
was
a
joy
to
paul
he
sat
there
by
the
and
played
with
the
things
opening
the
lids
of
gold
boxes
and
sniffing
bottles
of
scent
with
an
air
of
right
and
possession
which
made
his
lady
smile
like
a
purring
cat
then
he
tried
on
her
rings
but
they
would
only
go
on
to
the
second
joint
of
his
little
finger
as
he
laughingly
showed
her
and
finally
he
pushed
anna
aside
and
insisted
upon
putting
the
last
touches
himself
to
the
glorious
waves
of
black
hair
and
all
the
while
he
teased
the
maid
and
chaffed
her
in
infamous
french
to
her
great
delight
while
his
lady
looked
at
him
whole
wells
of
tenderness
deep
in
her
eyes
paul
had
adorable
ways
when
he
chose
no
wonder
both
mistress
and
maid
should
worship
him
the
moon
was
growing
larger
her
slender
contours
more
developed
and
the
stars
seemed
fainter
and
farther
off
nothing
more
exquisite
could
be
dreamed
of
thought
paul
than
the
view
from
their
balcony
windows
the
light
on
the
silver
snows
and
he
would
let
no
thought
that
it
was
the
last
night
they
would
see
it
together
mar
the
passionate
joy
of
the
hours
still
to
be
his
lady
had
never
been
more
sweet
it
was
as
if
this
wayward
undine
had
at
last
found
her
soul
and
lay
conquered
and
unresisting
in
her
lover
strong
arms
thus
in
perfect
peace
and
happiness
they
passed
their
last
night
on
the
bürgenstock
chapter
xiv
the
desolation
which
came
over
paul
when
next
day
before
lunch
time
he
found
himself
alone
on
the
terrace
looking
down
vainly
trying
to
distinguish
his
lady
launch
as
it
glided
over
the
blue
waters
seemed
unendurable
an
intense
depression
filled
his
being
it
was
as
if
a
limb
had
been
torn
from
him
he
felt
helpless
and
incomplete
and
his
whole
soul
drawn
to
lucerne
the
green
trees
and
the
exquisite
day
seemed
to
mock
him
alone
alone
with
no
prospect
of
seeing
his
queen
until
the
morrow
when
at
eleven
he
was
to
meet
her
at
the
at
the
foot
of
the
but
that
was
and
how
could
he
get
through
after
an
early
lunch
he
climbed
to
their
rock
at
the
summit
and
sat
there
where
they
had
sat
together
alone
with
his
thoughts
and
what
thoughts
what
was
this
marvellous
thing
which
had
happened
to
him
a
fortnight
ago
he
was
in
paris
disgusted
with
everything
around
him
and
fancying
himself
in
love
with
isabella
waring
poor
isabella
how
had
such
things
ever
been
possible
why
he
was
a
schoolboy
then
a
child
an
infant
and
now
he
was
a
man
and
knew
what
life
meant
in
its
greatest
and
best
that
was
part
of
the
wonder
of
this
lady
with
all
her
intense
sensuousness
and
absence
of
what
european
nations
call
morality
there
was
yet
nothing
low
or
degrading
in
her
influence
its
tendency
was
to
exalt
and
elevate
into
broad
views
and
logical
reasonings
nothing
small
would
ever
again
appeal
to
paul
his
whole
outlook
was
vaster
and
more
full
of
wide
thoughts
and
then
among
the
other
emotions
in
his
breast
came
one
of
deep
gratitude
to
her
for
apart
from
her
love
had
she
not
given
him
the
royalest
gift
which
mankind
could
receive
an
awakened
soul
like
her
story
of
undine
it
had
truly
been
born
with
that
first
long
kiss
then
his
mind
flew
to
their
the
immense
divine
bliss
of
these
whole
six
days
was
it
only
six
days
since
they
had
come
there
six
days
of
paradise
and
surely
fate
would
not
part
them
now
surely
more
hours
of
joy
lay
in
store
for
them
yet
the
moon
was
seven
days
old
and
his
lady
had
said
while
she
waxes
our
love
will
wax
thus
even
by
that
calculation
there
was
still
time
to
live
a
little
longer
paul
will
was
strong
he
sternly
banished
all
speculations
as
to
the
future
he
remembered
her
counsel
of
the
riddle
which
lay
hidden
in
the
eyes
of
the
sphinx
to
live
in
the
present
and
quaff
life
in
its
full
he
was
in
a
mood
of
such
worship
that
he
could
have
kissed
the
grey
rock
because
she
had
leant
against
it
and
to
himself
he
made
vows
that
come
what
might
he
would
ever
try
to
be
worthy
of
her
great
spirit
and
teaching
dmitry
pistol
still
lay
in
his
pocket
he
took
it
out
and
examined
it
all
six
chambers
were
loaded
a
deadly
small
thing
with
a
finely
engraved
stock
made
in
paris
there
was
a
date
scratched
it
was
about
a
year
old
what
danger
could
they
possibly
have
dreaded
for
him
he
almost
laughed
he
stayed
up
on
the
highest
point
until
after
the
sun
had
set
somehow
he
dreaded
going
back
to
the
rooms
where
they
had
been
so
happy
going
back
alone
but
this
was
weakness
and
he
must
get
over
the
feeling
after
dinner
he
would
spend
the
evening
writing
his
letters
home
but
when
this
solitary
meal
was
over
the
moon
tempted
him
out
on
to
the
terrace
and
there
he
stayed
obsessed
with
passionate
thoughts
until
he
crept
in
to
his
lonely
couch
he
could
not
sleep
it
had
no
memories
there
to
comfort
him
he
got
up
and
went
across
the
to
the
room
his
lady
had
left
so
lately
alas
it
was
all
dismantled
of
her
beautiful
things
the
bed
unmade
and
piled
with
uncovered
hotel
pillows
and
a
large
german
eiderdown
on
top
of
folded
blankets
it
all
looked
ghastly
and
sad
and
cold
and
more
depressed
than
ever
he
crept
back
to
his
own
bed
next
morning
was
grey
not
raining
but
dull
grey
clouds
all
over
the
sky
not
a
tempting
prospect
to
spend
it
in
a
launch
on
the
lake
a
wind
too
swept
the
water
into
small
rough
wavelets
would
she
come
the
uncertainty
was
almost
agony
he
was
waiting
long
before
the
time
appointed
and
walked
up
and
down
anxiously
scanning
the
direction
towards
lucerne
yes
that
was
the
launch
making
its
way
along
not
a
moment
late
oh
what
joy
thrilled
his
being
he
glowed
all
over
in
ten
minutes
or
less
he
could
clasp
her
hands
but
when
the
launch
came
in
full
view
he
perceived
no
lady
was
there
only
dmitry
black
form
stood
alone
by
the
chairs
paul
heart
sank
like
lead
he
could
hardly
contain
his
anxiety
until
the
servant
stepped
ashore
and
handed
him
a
letter
and
this
was
its
contents
my
beloved
one
i
am
not
well
a
foolish
chill
nothing
of
consequence
only
the
cold
wind
of
the
lake
i
could
not
face
at
one
when
lucerne
is
at
lunch
come
to
me
by
the
terrace
gate
come
to
me
i
can
not
live
without
you
paul
what
is
it
dmitry
he
said
anxiously
madame
is
not
ill
is
she
tell
me
not
ill
oh
no
the
servant
said
only
paul
must
know
madame
was
of
a
delicacy
at
times
in
the
cold
weather
and
had
to
be
careful
of
herself
he
added
too
that
it
would
be
wiser
if
paul
would
lunch
early
before
they
started
because
as
he
explained
it
was
not
for
the
people
of
the
hotel
to
know
he
was
there
and
how
else
could
he
eat
all
of
which
advice
was
followed
and
at
one
they
landed
at
lucerne
and
paul
walked
quickly
towards
his
goal
dmitry
in
front
to
see
that
the
way
was
clear
yes
there
was
no
one
about
for
the
moment
and
like
ghosts
they
glided
through
the
little
terrace
door
and
paul
went
into
the
room
by
the
window
while
dmitry
held
the
heavy
curtains
and
then
disappeared
it
was
empty
the
fact
struck
a
chill
note
in
spite
of
the
great
bowls
of
flowers
and
the
exquisite
scent
his
tiger
was
there
and
the
velvet
pillows
of
old
all
was
warm
and
luxurious
as
befitting
the
shrine
of
his
goddess
and
queen
only
he
was
alone
alone
with
his
thoughts
an
incredible
excitement
swept
through
him
his
heart
beat
to
suffocation
in
the
longing
for
her
to
come
was
it
possible
was
it
true
that
soon
she
would
be
in
his
arms
a
whole
world
of
privation
and
empty
hours
to
make
up
for
in
their
first
kiss
then
from
behind
the
screen
of
the
door
to
her
room
she
came
at
last
a
stately
figure
in
long
black
draperies
her
face
startlingly
white
and
her
head
wrapped
in
a
mist
of
black
veil
but
who
can
tell
of
the
note
of
gladness
and
welcome
she
put
into
the
two
words
my
paul
and
who
can
tell
of
the
passionate
joy
of
their
long
tender
embrace
or
of
their
talk
of
each
one
impossible
night
his
lady
too
had
not
slept
it
appeared
she
had
cried
she
said
and
fought
with
her
pillow
and
been
so
wicked
to
anna
that
the
good
creature
had
wept
she
had
torn
her
fine
night
raiment
and
bitten
a
handkerchief
through
but
now
he
had
come
and
her
soul
was
at
rest
what
wonder
when
all
this
was
said
in
his
ear
with
soft
broken
sighs
and
kisses
divine
that
paul
should
feel
like
a
god
in
his
pride
then
he
held
her
at
and
looked
at
her
face
yes
it
was
very
pale
indeed
and
the
violet
shadows
lay
under
her
black
lashes
had
she
suffered
his
darling
was
she
ill
but
no
the
fire
in
her
strange
eyes
gave
no
look
of
i
was
frightened
my
own
he
said
in
case
you
were
really
not
well
i
must
pet
and
take
care
of
you
all
the
day
see
you
must
lie
on
the
sofa
among
the
cushions
and
i
will
sit
beside
you
and
soothe
you
to
rest
and
he
lifted
her
in
his
strong
arms
and
carried
her
to
the
couch
as
if
she
had
been
a
baby
and
settled
her
there
every
touch
a
caress
his
lady
delighted
in
these
exhibitions
of
his
strength
he
had
grown
to
understand
that
he
could
always
affect
her
when
he
pretended
to
dominate
her
by
sheer
brute
force
she
had
explained
it
to
him
thus
one
day
you
see
paul
a
man
can
always
keep
a
woman
loving
him
if
he
kiss
her
enough
and
make
her
feel
that
there
is
no
use
struggling
because
he
is
too
strong
to
resist
a
woman
will
stand
almost
anything
from
a
passionate
lover
he
may
beat
her
and
pain
her
soft
flesh
he
may
shut
her
up
and
deprive
her
of
all
other
friends
while
the
motive
is
raging
love
and
interest
in
herself
on
his
part
it
only
makes
her
love
him
the
more
the
reason
why
women
become
unfaithful
is
because
the
man
grows
casual
and
having
awakened
a
taste
for
passionate
joys
he
no
longer
gratifies
them
so
she
yawns
and
turns
elsewhere
well
there
was
no
fear
of
her
doing
so
if
he
could
help
it
he
was
more
than
willing
to
follow
this
receipt
indeed
there
was
something
about
her
so
agitating
and
alluring
that
he
knew
in
his
heart
all
men
would
feel
the
same
towards
her
in
a
more
or
less
degree
and
wild
jealousy
coursed
through
his
veins
at
the
thought
my
paul
she
said
do
you
know
i
have
a
plan
in
my
head
that
we
shall
go
to
venice
to
venice
said
paul
in
delight
to
venice
yes
i
can
not
endure
any
more
of
lucerne
parted
from
you
with
only
the
prospect
of
snatched
meetings
it
is
not
to
be
borne
we
shall
go
to
that
home
of
strange
joy
my
lover
and
there
for
a
space
at
least
we
can
live
in
peace
paul
asked
no
better
gift
of
fate
venice
he
had
always
longed
to
see
and
now
to
see
it
with
her
ah
the
very
thought
was
ecstasy
to
him
and
made
the
blood
bound
in
his
veins
when
when
my
darling
he
asked
tomorrow
when
is
friday
she
said
one
must
give
dmitry
time
to
make
the
arrangements
and
take
a
palace
for
us
shall
we
say
sunday
paul
i
shall
go
on
sunday
and
you
can
follow
the
next
day
so
by
tuesday
evening
we
shall
be
together
again
not
to
part
until
the
end
the
end
said
paul
with
sinking
heart
sweetheart
she
whispered
while
she
drew
his
face
down
to
hers
think
nothing
evil
i
said
the
end
but
fate
alone
knows
when
that
must
be
do
not
let
us
force
her
hand
by
speculating
about
it
remember
always
to
live
while
we
may
and
paul
was
more
or
less
comforted
but
in
moments
of
silence
all
through
the
day
he
seemed
to
hear
the
echo
of
the
words
the
end
chapter
xv
it
was
a
beautiful
apartment
that
dmitry
had
found
for
them
on
the
grand
canal
in
venice
in
an
old
palace
looking
southwest
a
convenient
door
in
a
side
canal
cloaked
the
exit
and
entry
of
its
inhabitants
from
curious
eyes
had
there
been
any
to
indulge
in
curiosity
but
in
venice
there
is
a
good
deal
of
the
feeling
of
live
and
let
live
and
the
far
of
the
life
is
not
conducive
to
an
interest
in
the
doings
of
one
neighbours
money
and
intelligence
can
achieve
a
number
of
things
in
a
short
space
of
time
and
dmitry
had
had
both
at
his
command
so
everything
including
a
from
paris
and
a
retinue
of
italian
servants
was
ready
when
on
the
tuesday
evening
paul
arrived
at
the
station
what
a
wonderland
it
seemed
to
him
venice
a
wonderland
where
was
awaiting
him
his
heart
delight
more
passionately
desired
than
ever
after
three
days
of
total
abstinence
as
after
the
friday
afternoon
he
had
spent
more
or
less
in
hiding
in
the
his
lady
had
judged
it
wiser
for
him
not
to
come
at
all
to
lucerne
and
on
the
saturday
had
met
him
at
a
quiet
part
of
the
shore
of
the
lake
beyond
the
of
the
and
for
a
few
short
hours
they
had
cruised
about
on
the
blue
waters
but
her
sweetest
tenderness
and
ready
wit
had
not
been
able
entirely
to
eliminate
the
feeling
of
unrest
which
troubled
them
and
then
there
were
the
nights
the
miserable
evenings
and
nights
of
separation
on
the
sunday
she
had
departed
to
venice
and
after
she
had
gone
paul
had
returned
for
one
day
to
lucerne
leaving
again
on
the
monday
apparently
as
unacquainted
with
madame
zalenska
as
he
had
been
the
first
night
of
his
arrival
he
had
not
seen
her
since
saturday
three
whole
days
of
anguishing
longing
and
now
in
half
an
hour
at
least
she
would
be
in
his
arms
the
journey
through
the
beautiful
scenery
from
lucerne
had
been
got
through
at
night
all
day
from
milan
a
feverish
excitement
had
dominated
him
and
prevented
his
taking
any
interest
in
outward
surroundings
a
magnetic
attraction
seemed
drawing
him
on
on
to
the
centre
of
light
and
joy
his
lady
presence
dmitry
and
an
italian
servant
awaited
his
arrival
not
an
instant
delay
for
luggage
called
a
halt
tompson
and
the
italian
were
left
for
that
and
paul
departed
with
his
trusty
guide
it
was
about
seven
the
opalescent
lights
were
beginning
to
show
in
the
sky
and
their
reflection
in
the
water
as
he
stooped
his
tall
head
to
enter
the
covered
gondola
it
was
all
too
beautiful
and
wonderful
to
take
in
at
once
and
then
he
only
wanted
wings
the
sooner
to
arrive
not
eyes
to
see
the
passing
objects
afterwards
the
strange
soft
cry
of
the
gondoliers
and
the
sights
appealed
to
him
but
on
this
first
evening
every
throb
of
his
being
was
centred
upon
the
one
moment
when
he
should
hold
his
beloved
one
to
his
heart
he
could
hardly
contain
his
impatience
and
walk
sedately
beside
dmitry
when
they
ascended
the
great
stone
staircase
he
felt
like
bounding
up
three
steps
at
a
time
dmitry
had
been
respectfully
silent
madame
was
well
that
was
all
he
would
say
he
opened
the
great
double
door
with
a
and
paul
found
himself
in
vast
hall
almost
unfurnished
but
for
some
tapestry
on
the
walls
and
a
huge
gilt
and
a
couple
of
chairs
it
was
ill
lit
and
there
was
something
of
decay
and
gloom
in
its
aspect
on
they
went
through
other
doors
to
a
salon
vast
and
gloomy
too
and
then
the
glory
and
joy
of
heaven
seemed
to
spring
upon
paul
view
when
the
shrine
of
the
goddess
was
reached
a
smaller
room
whose
windows
faced
the
grand
canal
now
illuminated
by
the
setting
sun
in
all
its
splendour
coming
in
shafts
from
the
balcony
blinds
and
among
the
quaintest
and
most
surroundings
mixed
with
her
own
wonderful
personal
notes
of
luxury
his
lady
rose
from
the
tiger
couch
to
meet
him
his
lady
his
queen
and
indeed
she
seemed
a
queen
when
at
last
he
held
her
at
to
look
at
her
she
was
garbed
all
ready
for
dinner
in
a
marvellous
garment
of
shimmering
purple
while
round
her
shoulders
a
scarf
of
brilliant
pale
emerald
gauze
all
fringed
with
gold
fell
in
two
long
ends
and
on
her
neck
and
in
her
ears
great
emeralds
gleamed
a
one
of
unusual
brilliancy
fell
at
the
parting
of
her
waves
of
hair
on
to
her
white
smooth
forehead
but
the
colour
of
her
eyes
he
could
not
be
sure
of
only
they
were
two
wells
of
love
and
passion
gazing
into
his
own
all
the
simplicity
of
the
bürgenstock
surroundings
was
gone
the
flowers
were
in
the
greatest
profusion
rare
and
the
pillows
of
the
couch
were
more
splendid
than
ever
cloths
of
gold
and
silver
and
wonderful
shades
of
orange
and
green
velvet
were
among
the
purple
ones
he
already
knew
priceless
pieces
of
brocade
interwoven
with
gold
covered
the
screens
and
other
couches
and
near
enough
to
pick
up
when
she
wanted
them
stood
jewelled
boxes
of
cigarettes
and
bonbons
and
stands
of
perfume
her
expression
too
was
altered
a
new
mood
shone
there
and
later
when
paul
learnt
the
history
of
the
wonderful
women
of
venice
it
seemed
as
if
something
of
their
exotic
voluptuous
spirit
now
lived
in
her
this
was
a
new
queen
to
worship
and
die
for
if
necessary
he
dimly
felt
even
in
these
first
moments
that
here
he
would
drink
still
deeper
of
the
mysteries
of
life
and
passionate
love
she
said
my
priceless
one
at
last
i
have
you
again
to
make
me
ah
i
must
know
it
is
really
you
my
paul
they
were
sitting
on
the
tiger
by
now
and
she
undulated
round
and
all
over
him
feeling
his
coat
and
his
face
and
his
hair
as
a
blind
person
might
till
at
last
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
twined
about
him
like
a
serpent
and
every
now
and
then
a
narrow
shaft
of
the
glorious
dying
sunlight
would
strike
the
great
emerald
on
her
forehead
and
give
forth
sparks
of
vivid
green
which
appeared
reflected
again
in
her
eyes
head
swam
he
felt
intoxicated
with
bliss
this
venice
is
for
you
and
me
my
paul
she
said
the
air
is
full
of
love
and
dreams
we
have
left
the
slender
moon
behind
us
in
switzerland
here
she
is
nearing
her
full
and
the
summer
is
upon
us
with
all
her
richness
and
completeness
the
spring
of
our
love
has
passed
her
voice
fell
into
its
rhythmical
cadence
as
if
she
were
whispering
a
prophecy
inspired
by
some
presence
beyond
we
will
drink
deep
of
the
cup
of
delight
my
lover
and
bathe
in
the
wine
of
the
gods
we
shall
feast
on
the
tongues
of
nightingales
and
rest
on
couches
of
flowers
and
thou
shalt
cede
me
thy
soul
beloved
and
i
will
give
thee
mine
but
the
rest
was
lost
in
the
meeting
of
their
lips
they
dined
on
the
open
loggia
its
curtains
drawn
hiding
them
from
the
view
of
the
palaces
opposite
but
not
preventing
the
soft
sounds
of
the
singers
in
the
gondolas
moored
to
the
poles
beneath
from
reaching
their
ears
and
above
the
music
now
and
then
would
come
the
faint
splash
of
water
and
the
stahi
premé
of
some
moving
gondolier
the
food
was
of
the
richest
beginning
with
strange
fishes
and
quantities
of
that
paul
knew
not
accompanied
by
in
several
forms
and
some
of
the
she
would
just
taste
and
some
send
instantly
away
and
all
the
while
a
little
fountain
of
her
own
perfume
played
from
a
group
of
sportive
cupids
in
silver
while
the
table
in
the
centre
was
piled
with
red
roses
dmitry
and
two
italian
footmen
waited
and
everything
was
done
with
the
greatest
state
a
regal
magnificence
was
in
the
lady
air
and
mien
she
spoke
of
the
splendours
of
venice
past
and
let
paul
feel
the
atmosphere
of
that
subtle
time
of
passion
and
life
of
here
a
and
there
a
murder
of
wisdom
and
vice
and
intoxicating
emotion
all
blended
in
a
kaleidoscope
of
gorgeousness
and
colour
and
once
again
her
vast
knowledge
came
as
a
fresh
wonder
to
paul
no
smallest
detail
of
history
seemed
wanting
in
her
talk
so
that
he
lived
again
in
that
old
world
and
felt
himself
a
doge
when
they
were
alone
at
last
tasting
the
golden
wine
she
rose
and
drew
him
to
the
loggia
balustrade
dmitry
had
drawn
back
the
curtains
and
extinguished
the
lights
and
only
the
brilliant
moon
lit
the
scene
a
splendid
moon
two
nights
from
the
full
there
she
shone
straight
down
upon
them
to
welcome
them
to
this
city
of
romance
what
loveliness
met
paul
view
a
loveliness
in
which
art
and
nature
blended
in
one
satisfying
whole
darling
he
said
this
is
better
than
the
bürgenstock
let
us
go
out
on
the
water
and
float
about
too
it
was
exceedingly
warm
these
last
days
of
may
and
that
night
not
a
zephyr
stirred
a
ripple
a
cloak
and
scarf
of
black
gauze
soon
hid
the
lady
splendour
and
they
descended
the
staircase
hand
in
hand
to
the
waiting
open
gondola
it
was
a
new
experience
of
joy
for
paul
to
recline
there
and
drift
away
down
the
stream
amidst
the
music
and
the
coloured
lanterns
and
the
wonderful
wonderful
spell
of
the
place
the
lady
was
silent
for
a
while
and
then
she
began
to
whisper
passionate
words
of
love
she
had
never
before
been
thus
carried
away
and
he
must
say
them
to
her
as
he
held
her
hand
burning
words
inflaming
the
imagination
and
exciting
the
sense
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
other
nights
of
love
were
concentrated
into
this
one
in
its
perfect
joy
who
can
tell
of
the
wild
exaltation
which
filled
paul
he
was
no
longer
just
paul
verdayne
the
ordinary
young
englishman
he
was
a
god
and
this
was
olympus
look
paul
she
said
at
last
can
you
not
see
desdemona
peeping
from
the
balcony
of
her
house
there
and
to
think
she
will
have
no
happiness
before
her
moor
will
strangle
her
death
without
joys
ah
that
is
cruel
some
joys
are
well
worth
death
are
they
not
my
lover
as
you
and
i
should
know
worth
death
and
eternity
said
paul
for
one
such
night
as
this
with
you
a
man
would
sell
his
soul
it
was
not
until
they
turned
at
the
opening
of
the
guidecca
to
return
to
their
palazzo
that
they
both
became
aware
of
another
gondola
following
them
always
at
the
same
distance
behind
a
gondola
with
two
solitary
figures
in
it
huddled
on
the
seats
the
lady
gave
a
whispered
order
in
italian
to
her
gondolier
who
came
to
a
sudden
stop
thus
forcing
the
other
boat
to
come
much
nearer
before
it
too
arrested
its
course
there
a
moonbeam
caught
the
faces
of
the
men
as
they
leant
forward
to
see
what
had
occurred
one
of
them
was
dmitry
and
the
other
a
younger
man
of
the
pure
kalmuck
type
whom
paul
had
never
seen
vasili
exclaimed
the
lady
in
passionate
surprise
vasili
and
they
have
not
told
me
she
trembled
all
over
while
her
eyes
blazed
green
flames
of
anger
and
excitement
if
it
is
unnecessary
they
shall
feel
the
whip
for
this
her
cloak
had
fallen
aside
a
little
disclosing
a
shimmer
of
purple
garment
and
flashing
emeralds
she
looked
barbaric
her
raven
brows
knit
it
might
have
been
cleopatra
commanding
the
instant
death
of
an
offending
slave
it
made
paul
pulses
bound
it
seemed
so
of
the
picture
and
the
night
all
was
a
mad
dream
of
exotic
emotion
and
this
was
just
an
extra
note
but
who
was
vasili
and
what
did
his
presence
portend
something
fateful
at
all
events
the
lady
did
not
speak
further
only
by
the
quiver
of
her
nostrils
and
the
gleam
in
her
eyes
he
knew
how
deeply
she
was
stirred
yes
one
or
the
other
would
feel
the
whip
if
they
had
been
in
their
duties
it
seemed
out
of
sheer
defiance
of
some
fate
that
she
decided
to
go
on
into
the
lagoon
when
they
passed
san
georgio
it
was
growing
late
and
paul
thoughts
had
turned
to
greater
joys
he
longed
to
clasp
her
in
his
arms
to
hold
her
and
prove
her
his
own
but
she
sat
there
her
small
head
held
high
and
her
eyes
fearless
and
proud
thus
he
did
not
dare
to
plead
with
her
but
presently
when
she
perceived
the
servants
were
no
longer
following
her
mood
changed
the
sweetness
of
the
serpent
of
old
nile
fell
upon
her
and
all
of
love
that
can
be
expressed
in
whispered
words
and
tender
she
lavished
upon
paul
after
ordering
the
gondolier
to
hasten
back
to
the
palazzo
it
seemed
as
if
she
too
could
not
contain
her
impatience
to
be
again
in
her
lover
arms
i
will
not
question
them
she
said
when
they
arrived
and
she
saw
dmitry
awaiting
her
on
the
steps
we
will
live
and
love
at
least
my
paul
live
and
love
in
passionate
bliss
but
she
could
not
repress
the
flash
of
her
eyes
which
appeared
to
annihilate
the
old
servant
he
fell
on
his
knees
with
the
murmured
words
of
supplication
o
imperatorskoye
and
paul
guessed
it
meant
imperial
highness
and
a
great
wonder
grew
in
his
mind
their
supper
was
laid
in
the
loggia
again
and
under
the
windows
the
musicians
still
played
and
sang
a
gentle
accompaniment
to
their
sighs
of
love
but
later
still
paul
learnt
what
fiercest
passion
meant
making
other
memories
as
moonlight
unto
sunlight
as
water
unto
wine
chapter

to
some
natures
security
hath
no
charm
the
sword
of
damocles
suspended
over
their
heads
adds
to
their
enjoyment
of
anything
of
such
seemed
paul
and
his
lady
it
was
as
if
they
were
snatching
astonishing
pleasures
from
the
very
brink
of
some
danger
none
the
less
in
magnitude
because
unknown
they
did
not
breakfast
until
after
one
the
next
day
and
then
she
bade
him
sleep
sleep
on
this
other
loggia
where
they
sat
which
gave
upon
the
side
canal
obliquely
while
looking
into
a
small
garden
of
roses
and
oleanders
below
here
were
shade
and
a
cool
small
breeze
we
are
so
weary
my
beloved
one
the
lady
said
let
us
sleep
on
these
couches
of
smooth
silk
sleep
the
heavy
hours
of
the
afternoon
away
and
go
to
the
piazza
when
the
heat
of
the
sun
has
lessened
in
measure
an
immense
languor
was
over
paul
he
asked
nothing
better
than
to
rest
there
in
the
perfumed
shade
near
enough
to
his
loved
one
to
be
able
to
stretch
out
his
arm
and
touch
her
hair
and
soon
a
sweet
sleep
claimed
him
and
all
was
oblivion
and
peace
the
lady
lay
still
on
her
couch
for
a
while
her
eyes
gleaming
between
their
lids
but
at
last
when
she
saw
that
paul
indeed
slept
deeply
she
rose
stealthily
and
crept
from
the
place
back
to
the
room
the
gloomy
vast
room
within
where
she
summoned
dmitry
and
ordered
the
man
she
had
called
vasili
the
night
before
into
her
presence
he
came
with
cringing
diffidence
prostrating
himself
to
the
ground
before
her
and
kissing
the
hem
of
her
dress
mute
adoration
in
his
dark
eyes
like
those
of
a
faithful
dog
a
great
scar
showing
blue
on
his
bronzed
cheek
and
forehead
she
questioned
him
imperiously
while
he
answered
humbly
in
fear
dmitry
stood
by
an
anxious
strained
look
on
his
face
and
now
and
then
he
put
in
a
word
of
what
danger
did
they
warn
her
these
two
faithful
servants
one
came
from
afar
for
no
other
purpose
it
seemed
whatever
it
was
she
received
the
news
in
haughty
defiance
she
spoke
fiercely
at
first
and
they
humbled
themselves
the
more
then
anna
appeared
and
joined
her
supplications
to
theirs
till
at
last
the
lady
like
a
pettish
child
chasing
a
brood
of
tiresome
chickens
shooed
them
all
from
the
room
laughter
and
tears
then
she
threw
up
her
arms
in
rage
for
a
moment
and
ran
back
to
the
loggia
where
paul
still
slept
here
she
sat
and
looked
at
him
with
burning
eyes
of
love
he
was
certainly
changed
in
the
eighteen
days
since
she
had
first
seen
him
his
face
was
thinner
the
beautiful
lines
of
youth
were
drawn
with
a
finer
hand
he
was
paler
too
and
a
shadow
lay
under
his
curly
lashes
but
even
in
his
sleep
it
seemed
as
if
his
awakened
soul
had
set
its
seal
upon
his
expression
he
had
tasted
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
now
the
lady
crept
near
him
and
kissed
his
hair
then
she
flung
herself
on
her
own
couch
and
soon
she
also
slept
it
was
six
before
they
awoke
paul
first
and
what
was
his
joy
to
be
able
to
kneel
beside
her
and
watch
her
for
a
few
seconds
before
her
white
lids
lifted
themselves
an
attitude
of
utter
weariness
and
was
hers
she
was
as
a
child
tired
out
with
passionate
weeping
who
had
fallen
to
sleep
as
she
had
flung
herself
down
there
was
something
even
pathetic
about
that
proud
head
laid
low
upon
her
clasped
arms
paul
gazed
and
gazed
how
he
worshipped
her
wayward
tigerish
beautiful
queen
but
never
selfish
or
small
and
what
great
thing
had
she
not
done
for
him
she
who
must
have
been
able
to
choose
from
all
the
world
a
lover
and
she
had
chosen
him
how
poor
and
narrow
were
all
the
thoughts
of
his
former
life
everywhere
hedged
in
with
foolish
prejudice
and
ignorant
certainty
now
all
the
world
should
be
his
and
some
day
he
would
show
her
he
was
worthy
of
her
splendid
teaching
and
belief
in
him
and
her
gift
of
an
awakened
soul
he
bent
still
lower
on
his
knees
and
kissed
her
feet
with
deepest
reverence
she
stirred
not
she
was
so
very
pale
fear
came
to
him
for
an
instant
and
then
he
kissed
her
mouth
her
wonderful
eyes
unclosed
themselves
with
none
of
the
bewildered
stare
people
often
wake
with
when
aroused
suddenly
it
seemed
that
even
in
her
sleep
she
had
been
conscious
of
her
loved
one
presence
her
lips
parted
in
a
smile
while
her
heavy
lashes
again
swept
her
cheeks
sweetheart
she
said
you
could
awake
me
from
the
dead
i
think
but
we
are
living
still
my
paul
waste
we
no
more
time
in
dreams
they
made
haste
and
were
soon
in
the
gondola
on
their
way
to
the
piazza
paul
she
said
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
which
included
all
the
beauty
around
i
am
so
glad
you
only
see
venice
now
when
your
eyes
can
take
it
in
sweetheart
at
first
it
would
have
said
almost
nothing
to
you
and
she
smiled
playfully
in
fact
my
paul
would
have
spent
most
of
his
time
in
wondering
how
he
could
get
exercise
enough
there
being
so
few
places
to
walk
in
he
would
have
bought
a
nigger
boy
with
a
dish
for
his
father
and
some
venetian
mirrors
for
his
aunts
and
perhaps
yes
a
piece
of
jesurum
lace
for
his
mother
and
some
blown
glass
for
his
friends
he
would
have
walked
through
mark
and
thought
it
was
a
place
with
uneven
pavements
and
he
would
have
noticed
there
were
a
lot
of
pigeons
in
the
square
then
he
would
have
been
captious
with
the
food
at
his
hotel
grumbled
at
the
waiters
scolded
poor
tompson
and
left
for
rome
oh
darling
said
paul
laughing
too
in
spite
of
his
protest
surely
surely
i
never
was
so
bad
as
that
and
yet
i
expect
it
is
probably
true
how
can
i
ever
thank
you
enough
for
giving
me
eyes
and
an
understanding
there
there
beloved
she
said
they
walked
through
the
piazza
the
pigeons
amused
paul
and
they
stopped
and
bought
corn
for
them
and
fed
the
greedy
creatures
ever
ready
for
the
unending
largess
of
strangers
one
or
two
bolder
than
the
rest
alighted
on
the
lady
hat
and
shoulder
taking
the
corn
from
between
her
red
lips
and
paul
felt
jealous
even
of
the
birds
and
drew
her
on
to
see
the
campanile
still
standing
then
they
looked
at
it
all
they
looked
at
the
lion
and
finally
they
entered
mark
and
here
paul
held
her
arm
and
gazed
with
bated
breath
it
was
all
so
beautiful
and
wonderful
and
new
to
his
eyes
he
had
scarcely
ever
been
in
a
roman
catholic
church
before
and
had
not
guessed
at
the
gorgeous
beauty
of
this
shrine
they
hardly
spoke
she
did
not
weary
him
with
details
like
a
that
would
be
for
his
visits
but
now
he
must
see
it
just
as
a
glorious
whole
they
worshipped
here
and
endowed
their
temple
with
gold
and
jewels
she
whispered
and
then
they
went
into
the
doge
palace
and
placed
a
word
in
the
lion
mouth
which
meant
death
or
destruction
to
their
best
friends
a
wonderful
people
those
old
venetians
sly
and
fierce
cruel
and
passionate
but
with
ever
a
shrewd
smile
in
their
eye
even
in
their
i
often
ask
myself
paul
if
we
are
not
too
civilised
we
of
our
time
we
think
too
much
of
human
suffering
and
so
we
cultivate
the
nerves
to
suffer
more
instead
of
hardening
them
picture
to
yourself
in
my
grandfather
boyhood
we
had
still
the
serfs
i
am
of
his
day
though
it
is
over
i
have
beaten
dmitry
then
she
stopped
speaking
abruptly
as
though
aware
she
had
localised
her
nation
too
much
a
strange
imperious
expression
came
into
her
eyes
as
they
met
paul
almost
of
defiance
paul
was
moved
he
began
as
if
to
speak
then
he
remembered
his
promise
never
to
question
her
and
remained
silent
yes
my
paul
you
have
promised
you
know
she
said
i
am
for
you
your
love
your
love
but
living
or
dead
you
must
never
seek
to
know
more
ah
he
cried
you
torture
me
when
you
speak
like
that
or
dead
my
god
that
means
us
both
we
stand
or
fall
together
dear
one
her
voice
fell
softly
into
a
note
of
intense
earnestness
while
fate
lets
us
be
together
yes
living
or
dead
but
if
we
must
part
then
either
would
be
the
cause
of
the
death
of
the
other
by
further
seeking
never
forget
that
my
beloved
one
listen
her
eyes
took
a
sudden
fierceness
once
i
read
your
english
book
lady
and
the
tiger
you
remember
it
paul
she
must
choose
which
she
would
give
her
lover
to
death
and
the
tiger
or
to
another
and
more
beautiful
woman
one
was
left
you
understand
to
decide
the
end
one
self
it
caused
question
at
the
moment
some
were
for
one
choice
some
for
the
other
but
for
me
there
was
never
any
hesitation
i
would
give
you
to
a
thousand
tigers
sooner
than
to
another
woman
just
as
i
would
give
my
life
a
thousand
times
for
your
life
my
lover
darling
said
paul
and
i
for
yours
my
fierce
adorable
queen
but
why
should
we
speak
of
terrible
things
are
we
not
happy
today
and
now
and
have
you
not
told
me
to
live
while
we
may
come
she
said
and
they
walked
on
down
to
the
gondola
again
and
floated
away
out
to
the
lagoon
but
when
they
were
there
far
away
from
the
world
she
talked
in
a
new
strain
of
earnestness
to
paul
he
must
promise
to
do
something
with
his
life
something
useful
and
great
in
future
years
you
must
not
just
drift
my
paul
like
so
many
of
your
countrymen
do
you
must
help
to
stem
the
tide
of
your
nation
decadence
and
be
a
strong
man
for
me
when
i
read
now
of
england
it
seems
as
if
all
the
hereditary
legislators
it
is
what
you
call
your
nobles
eh
these
men
have
for
their
motto
like
louis
moi
le
it
will
last
my
time
paul
wherever
i
am
it
will
give
me
joy
for
you
to
be
strong
and
great
sweetheart
i
shall
know
then
i
have
not
loved
just
a
beautiful
shell
whose
mind
i
was
able
to
light
for
a
time
that
is
a
sadness
paul
perhaps
the
greatest
of
all
to
see
a
soul
one
has
illuminated
and
awakened
to
the
highest
point
gradually
slipping
back
to
a
browsing
sheep
to
live
for
alone
and
horses
and
dogs
with
each
day
no
higher
aim
than
its
own
mean
pleasure
ah
paul
she
continued
with
sudden
passion
i
would
rather
you
were
dead
dead
and
cold
with
me
than
i
should
have
to
feel
you
were
growing
a
du
a
thing
who
will
go
down
into
nothingness
and
be
forgotten
by
men
her
face
was
aflame
with
the
the
noble
brow
and
line
of
her
throat
will
ever
remain
in
paul
memory
as
a
thing
apart
in
womankind
who
could
have
small
or
unworthy
thoughts
who
had
known
her
this
splendid
lady
and
his
worship
grew
and
grew
chapter
xvii
that
night
as
they
looked
from
the
loggia
on
the
grand
canal
after
dinner
the
moonlight
making
things
almost
light
as
day
dmitry
begged
admittance
from
the
doorway
of
the
great
salon
the
lady
turned
imperiously
and
flashed
upon
him
how
dared
he
interrupt
their
happy
hour
with
things
of
earth
then
she
saw
he
was
loth
to
speak
before
paul
and
that
his
face
was
grey
with
fear
paul
realised
the
situation
and
moved
aside
pretending
to
lean
from
the
wide
windows
and
watch
the
passing
gondolas
his
wandering
attention
however
fixing
itself
upon
one
which
was
moored
not
far
from
the
palazzo
and
occupied
by
a
solitary
figure
reclining
motionless
in
the
seats
it
had
no
coloured
lights
this
gondola
or
merry
musicians
it
was
just
a
black
object
of
silence
tenanted
by
one
man
dmitry
whispered
and
the
lady
listened
a
quiver
of
rage
going
through
her
lithe
body
then
she
turned
and
surveyed
the
moored
gondola
the
same
storm
of
passion
and
hate
in
her
eyes
as
once
before
had
come
there
at
the
rigi
kaltbad
belvedere
shall
i
kill
the
miserable
spy
vasili
would
do
it
this
night
she
hissed
between
her
clenched
teeth
but
to
what
end
a
day
respite
perhaps
and
then
another
and
another
to
face
dmitry
raised
an
imploring
hand
to
draw
her
from
the
wide
arched
opening
where
she
must
be
in
full
view
of
those
watching
below
she
motioned
him
furiously
aside
and
took
paul
hand
come
my
lover
she
said
we
will
look
no
more
on
this
treacherous
stream
it
is
full
of
the
ghosts
of
past
murders
and
fears
let
us
return
to
our
shrine
and
shut
out
all
jars
we
will
sit
on
our
tiger
and
forget
even
the
moon
beloved
one
come
and
she
led
him
to
the
open
doorway
but
the
hand
which
held
his
was
cold
as
ice
a
tumult
of
emotion
was
dominating
paul
he
understood
now
that
danger
was
near
he
guessed
they
were
being
watched
but
by
whom
by
the
orders
of
her
husband
ah
that
thought
drove
him
mad
with
rage
her
husband
she
his
own
the
mate
of
his
soul
of
his
body
and
soul
was
the
legal
belonging
of
somebody
else
some
vile
man
whom
she
hated
and
loathed
a
rotting
carrion
spoiling
god
earth
and
he
paul
was
powerless
to
change
this
fact
was
powerless
altogether
except
to
love
her
and
die
for
her
if
that
would
be
for
her
good
queen
he
said
his
voice
hoarse
with
passion
and
pain
let
us
leave
venice
leave
europe
altogether
let
me
take
you
away
to
some
far
land
of
peace
and
live
there
in
safety
and
joy
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
you
would
always
be
the
empress
of
my
being
and
soul
she
flung
herself
on
the
tiger
couch
and
writhed
there
for
some
moments
burying
her
clenched
fists
in
the
creature
deep
fur
then
she
opened
wide
her
arms
and
drew
paul
to
her
in
a
close
passionate
embrace
my
beloved
my
darling
one
she
whispered
in
anguish
if
we
were
lesser
persons
yes
we
could
hide
and
live
for
a
time
in
a
tent
under
the
stars
but
we
are
not
they
would
track
me
and
trap
us
and
sooner
or
later
there
would
be
the
end
the
ignominious
ordinary
end
of
disgrace
then
she
clasped
him
closer
and
whispered
right
in
his
ear
in
her
wonderful
voice
now
trembling
with
love
sweetheart
listen
beyond
all
of
this
there
is
that
thought
that
hope
ever
in
my
heart
that
one
day
a
son
of
ours
shall
worthily
fill
a
throne
so
we
must
not
think
of
ourselves
my
paul
of
the
thou
and
the
i
and
the
now
beloved
a
throne
which
is
filled
most
ignobly
at
present
and
only
filled
at
all
through
my
birth
and
my
family
influence
think
not
i
want
to
plant
a
cheat
no
i
have
a
right
to
find
an
heir
as
i
will
a
splendid
heir
who
shall
redeem
the
land
the
spirit
of
our
two
selves
given
being
by
love
and
endowed
by
the
gods
ah
think
of
it
paul
dream
of
this
joy
and
pride
it
will
help
to
still
the
unrest
we
are
both
suffering
now
it
must
quiet
this
wild
useless
rage
against
fate
is
it
not
so
my
lover
her
voice
touched
his
very
heartstrings
but
he
was
too
deeply
moved
to
answer
her
for
a
moment
the
renewal
of
this
thought
exalted
his
very
soul
all
that
was
noble
and
great
in
his
nature
seemed
rising
up
in
one
glad
a
son
of
his
and
hers
to
fill
a
throne
ah
god
if
that
were
so
i
love
the
english
she
whispered
i
have
known
the
men
of
all
nations
but
i
love
the
english
best
they
are
straight
and
just
the
fine
ones
at
least
they
are
brave
and
fair
and
fearless
and
our
baby
paul
shall
be
the
most
splendid
of
any
beloved
one
you
must
not
think
me
a
visionary
a
woman
dreaming
of
what
might
never
be
i
see
it
i
know
it
this
will
come
to
pass
as
i
say
and
then
we
shall
both
find
consolation
and
rest
thus
she
whispered
on
until
paul
was
intoxicated
with
joy
and
glory
and
forgot
time
and
place
and
danger
and
possible
parting
a
host
of
triumphant
angels
seemed
singing
in
his
ears
then
she
read
him
poetry
and
let
him
caress
her
and
smiled
in
his
arms
but
towards
morning
if
he
had
awakened
he
would
have
found
his
lady
prostrate
with
silent
weeping
the
intense
concentrated
grief
of
a
strong
nature
taking
its
farewell
chapter
xviii
now
this
thursday
was
the
night
of
the
full
moon
a
cloudless
morning
sky
promised
a
glorious
evening
the
lovers
woke
early
and
had
their
breakfast
on
the
loggia
overlooking
the
oleander
garden
the
lady
was
in
an
enchanting
mood
of
sunshine
and
no
one
could
have
guessed
of
the
sorrow
of
her
dawn
vigil
thoughts
she
was
wayward
and
playful
one
moment
petting
paul
with
exquisite
sweetness
the
next
teasing
his
curls
and
biting
the
lobes
of
his
ears
she
never
left
him
for
one
second
it
seemed
she
must
teach
him
still
more
subtle
caresses
and
call
forth
even
new
shades
of
emotion
and
bliss
all
fear
was
banished
only
a
brilliant
glory
remained
she
laughed
and
her
eyes
with
provoking
smiles
she
undulated
about
creeping
as
a
serpent
over
her
lover
and
kissing
his
eyelids
and
hair
they
were
so
infinitely
happy
it
was
growing
to
afternoon
before
they
thought
of
leaving
their
loggia
and
then
they
started
in
the
open
gondola
and
glided
away
through
quaint
narrow
canals
until
they
came
to
the
lagoon
we
shall
not
stay
in
the
gondola
long
my
paul
she
said
i
can
not
bear
to
be
out
of
your
arms
and
our
palace
is
fair
and
oh
my
beloved
i
shall
feast
you
as
never
before
the
night
of
our
full
moon
paul
i
have
ordered
a
bower
of
roses
and
music
and
song
i
want
you
to
remember
it
the
whole
of
your
life
as
though
i
could
forget
a
moment
of
our
time
my
sweet
said
paul
it
needs
no
feasts
or
roses
only
whatever
delights
you
to
do
delights
me
too
paul
she
cooed
after
a
while
during
which
her
hand
had
lain
in
his
and
there
had
been
a
soft
silence
is
not
this
a
life
of
joy
so
smooth
and
gliding
this
way
of
venice
it
seems
far
from
ruffles
and
storms
i
shall
love
it
always
shall
not
you
and
you
must
come
back
in
other
years
and
study
its
buildings
and
its
history
paul
with
your
new
fine
eyes
we
shall
come
together
my
darling
he
answered
i
should
never
want
anything
alone
sweetheart
she
cooed
again
in
his
ears
and
then
presently
paul
she
said
some
day
you
must
read
that
masterpiece
of
flaubert
there
is
a
spirit
of
love
in
that
which
now
you
would
understand
the
love
which
looked
out
of
matho
eyes
when
his
body
was
beaten
to
jelly
it
is
the
love
i
have
for
you
my
own
a
love
all
words
or
sense
as
one
of
your
english
poets
says
do
you
know
with
the
strange
irony
of
things
when
a
woman
love
for
a
man
rises
to
the
highest
point
there
is
in
it
always
an
element
of
however
wayward
and
tigerish
and
undomestic
she
may
be
she
then
desires
to
be
the
acknowledged
possession
and
belonging
of
the
man
even
to
her
own
dishonour
she
desires
to
reproduce
his
likeness
she
wants
to
compass
his
material
good
she
will
think
of
his
food
and
his
raiment
and
his
and
never
of
her
own
only
if
she
is
wise
she
will
hide
all
these
things
in
her
heart
for
the
average
man
can
not
stand
this
great
light
of
her
sweetness
and
when
her
love
becomes
selfless
his
love
will
wane
the
average
man
yes
perhaps
so
agreed
paul
but
then
what
does
the
average
person
of
either
sex
know
of
love
at
all
they
think
they
know
she
said
really
think
it
but
love
like
ours
happens
perhaps
once
in
a
century
and
generally
makes
history
of
some
sort
bad
or
good
let
it
said
paul
i
am
like
antony
in
that
poem
you
read
me
last
night
i
must
have
you
for
my
own
death
dishonour
anything
you
will
stand
in
the
way
he
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
antony
so
did
the
man
who
wrote
the
poem
he
was
a
great
sculptor
as
well
as
a
poet
the
lady
said
and
yes
he
knew
all
about
those
wonderful
lovers
better
far
than
your
shakespeare
did
who
leaves
me
quite
cold
when
i
read
his
view
of
them
cleopatra
was
to
me
so
subtle
so
splendid
a
queen
of
course
she
was
just
you
my
heart
said
paul
you
are
her
soul
living
over
again
and
that
poem
you
must
give
me
to
keep
some
day
because
it
says
just
what
i
shall
want
to
say
if
ever
i
must
be
away
from
you
for
a
time
see
have
i
remembered
it
right
her
till
i
see
those
eyes
i
do
not
live
that
rome
to
me
is
hateful
tell
her
oh
i
know
not
what
that
every
thought
and
feeling
space
and
spot
is
like
an
ugly
dream
where
she
is
not
all
persons
plagues
all
living
wearisome
all
talking
empty
yes
that
is
what
i
should
say
i
say
it
to
myself
now
even
in
the
short
while
i
am
absent
from
you
dressing
the
lady
eyes
brimmed
with
tenderness
paul
you
do
love
me
my
own
she
said
oh
why
ca
we
go
on
and
travel
together
darling
paul
continued
i
want
you
to
show
me
the
world
at
least
the
best
of
europe
in
every
country
you
would
make
me
feel
the
spirit
of
the
place
let
us
go
to
greece
and
see
the
temples
and
worship
those
old
gods
they
knew
about
love
did
they
not
the
lady
leant
back
and
smiled
as
if
she
liked
to
hear
him
talk
i
often
ask
myself
did
they
really
know
she
said
they
knew
the
whole
material
part
of
it
at
any
rate
they
were
perhaps
too
practical
to
have
indulged
in
the
mental
emotions
we
weave
into
it
now
but
they
were
wise
they
did
not
educate
the
wives
and
daughters
they
realised
that
to
perform
well
domestic
duties
a
woman
mind
should
not
be
in
learning
learning
and
charm
and
grace
of
mind
were
for
the
others
the
of
whom
they
asked
no
tiresome
ties
and
in
all
ages
it
is
unfortunately
not
the
simple
good
women
who
have
ruled
the
hearts
of
men
think
of
pericles
and
aspasia
antony
and
cleopatra
justinian
and
theodora
belisarius
and
antonina
and
later
all
the
mistresses
of
the
french
kings
even
too
your
english
nelson
and
lady
hamilton
not
one
of
these
was
a
man
ideal
of
what
a
wife
and
mother
ought
to
be
so
no
doubt
the
greeks
were
right
in
that
principle
as
they
were
right
in
all
basic
principles
of
art
and
balance
and
now
we
mix
the
whole
thing
up
my
paul
domesticity
and
learning
nerves
and
art
and
feverish
cravings
for
the
impossible
new
so
we
get
a
conglomeration
of
false
proportions
and
a
ceaseless
unrest
yes
said
paul
and
thought
of
his
mother
she
was
a
perfectly
domestic
and
beautiful
woman
but
somehow
he
felt
sure
she
had
never
made
his
father
heart
beat
then
his
mind
went
back
to
the
argument
in
what
the
lady
had
said
he
wanted
to
hear
more
if
this
is
so
that
would
prove
that
all
the
very
clever
women
of
history
were
immoral
do
you
mean
that
he
asked
the
lady
laughed
immoral
it
is
so
quaint
a
word
my
paul
each
one
sees
it
how
they
will
for
me
it
is
immoral
to
be
false
to
be
mean
to
steal
to
cheat
to
stoop
to
low
actions
and
small
ends
yet
one
can
be
and
do
all
those
things
and
if
one
remains
as
well
the
faithful
beast
of
burden
to
one
man
one
is
counted
in
the
world
a
moral
woman
but
that
shining
light
of
hypocrisy
and
virtue
to
judge
by
her
sentiments
in
her
writings
your
george
eliot
must
be
classed
as
immoral
because
having
chosen
her
mate
without
the
law
blessing
she
yet
wrote
the
highest
sentiments
of
british
respectability
to
me
she
was
being
immoral
because
she
was
deliberately
doing
what
again
i
say
judging
by
her
writings
she
felt
must
be
a
grievous
wrong
that
is
immoral
deliberately
to
still
conscience
and
indulge
in
a
pleasure
against
it
but
to
live
a
life
with
one
love
if
it
engenders
the
most
lofty
aspirations
to
me
is
highly
moral
and
good
i
feel
myself
ennobled
exalted
because
you
are
my
lover
and
our
child
when
it
comes
to
us
will
have
a
noble
mind
the
thought
of
this
as
ever
made
paul
thrill
he
forgot
all
other
arguments
and
a
quiver
ran
through
him
of
intense
emotion
his
eyes
swam
and
he
clasped
more
tightly
her
hand
the
lady
too
leant
back
and
closed
her
eyes
oh
the
beautiful
dream
she
said
the
beautiful
beautiful
certainly
sweetheart
let
us
have
done
with
all
this
philosophising
and
go
back
to
our
palace
where
we
are
happy
in
the
temple
of
the
greatest
of
all
gods
the
god
of
love
then
she
gave
the
order
for
home
but
on
the
way
they
stopped
at
jesurum
and
she
supervised
purchases
for
his
mother
and
allowed
him
to
buy
herself
some
small
gifts
and
between
them
they
spent
a
good
deal
of
money
and
laughed
over
it
like
happy
children
so
when
they
got
back
to
the
palazzo
there
was
joy
in
their
hearts
like
the
sunlight
of
the
late
afternoon
she
would
not
let
paul
go
on
to
the
loggia
overlooking
the
grand
canal
he
had
noticed
as
they
passed
that
some
high
screens
of
had
been
placed
in
front
of
the
wide
arched
openings
no
fear
of
prying
eyes
from
opposite
houses
now
and
yet
they
were
not
too
high
to
prevent
those
in
the
loggia
from
seeing
the
moon
and
the
sky
their
feast
was
preparing
evidently
and
he
knew
it
would
be
a
night
of
the
gods
but
from
then
until
it
was
time
to
dress
for
dinner
his
lady
decreed
that
they
should
rest
in
their
rooms
thou
must
sleep
my
paul
she
said
so
that
thy
spirit
may
be
fresh
for
new
joys
and
it
was
only
after
hard
pleading
she
would
allow
him
to
have
it
that
they
rested
on
the
other
loggia
couches
so
that
his
closing
eyes
might
know
her
near
chapter
xix
no
englishwoman
would
have
thought
of
the
details
which
made
the
feast
of
the
full
moon
so
wonderful
in
paul
eyes
it
savoured
rather
of
other
centuries
and
the
days
of
imperial
rome
and
indeed
had
his
lady
been
one
of
britain
daughters
he
too
might
have
found
it
a
little
as
it
was
it
was
all
in
the
note
the
exotic
note
of
venice
and
her
spells
the
lady
had
gone
to
her
room
when
he
woke
on
the
loggia
and
he
had
only
time
to
dress
before
the
appointed
moment
when
he
was
to
meet
her
in
the
little
salon
she
was
seated
on
the
old
venetian
chair
she
had
bought
in
lucerne
when
paul
entered
the
most
radiant
vision
he
had
yet
seen
her
garment
was
gauze
it
seemed
to
cling
in
misty
folds
round
her
exquisite
shape
it
was
clasped
with
pearls
the
most
magnificent
ones
hung
in
a
row
round
her
throat
and
fell
from
her
ears
a
diadem
confined
her
glorious
hair
which
descended
in
the
two
long
strands
twisted
with
chains
of
emeralds
and
diamonds
her
whole
personality
seemed
breathing
magnificence
and
grace
and
her
eyes
glowed
with
passion
and
mystery
and
force
paul
knelt
like
a
courtier
and
kissed
her
hand
then
he
led
her
to
their
feast
dmitry
raised
the
curtain
of
the
loggia
door
as
they
approached
and
what
a
sight
met
paul
view
the
whole
place
had
been
converted
into
a
bower
of
roses
the
walls
were
entirely
covered
with
them
a
great
couch
of
deepest
red
ones
was
at
one
side
fixed
in
such
masses
as
to
be
quite
resisting
and
firm
from
the
roof
chains
of
roses
hung
concealing
small
lights
while
from
above
the
screen
of
in
full
bloom
the
moon
in
all
her
glory
mingled
with
the
lamps
and
cast
a
glamour
and
unreality
over
the
whole
the
dinner
was
laid
on
a
table
in
the
centre
and
the
table
was
covered
with
tuberoses
and
stephanotis
surrounding
the
cupid
fountain
of
perfume
the
scent
of
all
these
flowers
and
the
warm
summer
night
no
wonder
senses
quivered
with
exaltation
no
wonder
his
head
swam
they
had
scarcely
been
seated
when
from
the
great
salon
whose
open
doors
were
hidden
by
falling
trellises
of
roses
there
came
the
exquisite
sounds
of
violins
and
a
boy
plaintive
voice
a
concert
of
all
sweet
airs
played
softly
to
further
excite
the
sense
paul
had
not
thought
such
musicians
could
be
obtained
in
venice
and
guessed
and
rightly
that
like
the
cook
and
the
artist
who
had
designed
it
they
hailed
from
paris
to
beautify
this
night
throughout
the
repast
his
lady
bewildered
him
with
her
wild
fascination
never
before
had
she
seemed
to
collect
all
her
moods
into
one
subtle
whole
cemented
together
by
passionate
love
it
truly
was
a
night
of
the
gods
and
the
exaltation
of
paul
spirit
had
reached
its
zenith
my
paul
she
said
when
at
last
only
the
rare
fruits
and
the
golden
wine
remained
and
they
were
quite
alone
even
the
musicians
had
retired
and
their
airs
floated
up
from
a
gondola
below
my
paul
i
want
you
never
to
forget
this
night
never
to
think
of
me
but
as
gloriously
happy
clasped
in
your
arms
amid
the
roses
and
see
we
must
drink
once
more
together
of
our
wedding
wine
and
complete
our
souls
delight
an
eloquence
seemed
to
come
to
paul
and
loosen
his
tongue
so
that
he
whispered
back
paeans
of
worship
in
language
as
fine
as
her
own
and
the
moon
flooded
the
loggia
with
her
light
and
the
roses
gave
forth
their
scent
it
was
the
supreme
effort
of
art
and
nature
to
cover
them
with
glorious
joy
my
darling
one
the
lady
whispered
in
his
ear
as
she
lay
in
his
arms
on
the
couch
of
roses
crushed
deep
and
half
buried
in
their
velvet
leaves
this
is
our
souls
wedding
in
life
and
in
death
they
can
never
part
more
dawn
was
creeping
through
the
orchid
blinds
of
their
sleeping
chamber
when
this
strange
queen
disengaged
herself
from
her
lover
embrace
and
bent
over
him
kissing
his
young
curved
lips
he
stirred
not
the
languor
of
utter
prostration
was
upon
him
and
held
him
in
its
grasp
in
the
uncertain
light
his
sleep
looked
pale
as
death
the
lady
gazed
at
him
an
anguish
too
deep
for
tears
in
her
eyes
for
was
not
this
the
end
the
very
end
fierce
dry
sobs
shook
her
there
was
something
terrible
and
tigerish
in
her
grief
and
yet
her
will
made
her
not
linger
there
was
still
one
thing
to
do
she
rose
and
turned
to
the
by
the
window
then
drawing
the
blind
aside
a
little
she
began
rapidly
to
write
when
she
had
finished
without
reading
the
missive
over
she
went
and
placed
it
with
a
flat
leather
on
her
pillow
beside
paul
and
soon
she
commenced
a
madness
of
farewells
all
restrained
and
gentle
for
fear
he
should
awake
my
love
my
love
she
wailed
between
her
kisses
god
keep
you
safe
though
he
may
never
bring
you
back
to
me
then
with
a
wild
strangled
sob
she
fled
from
the
room
chapter
xx
a
hush
was
over
everything
when
paul
first
awoke
the
hush
of
a
hot
drowsy
noontide
he
stretched
out
his
arm
to
touch
his
loved
one
as
was
his
custom
to
draw
her
near
and
envelop
her
with
caresses
and
greeting
an
instinct
which
came
to
him
while
yet
half
asleep
but
his
arm
met
empty
space
what
was
this
he
opened
his
eyes
wide
and
sat
up
in
bed
he
was
alone
where
had
she
gone
he
had
slept
so
late
that
was
it
she
was
playing
one
of
her
sweet
tricks
upon
him
perhaps
she
was
even
hiding
behind
the
curtain
which
covered
the
entrance
to
the
side
loggia
where
they
were
accustomed
to
breakfast
he
would
look
and
see
he
rose
quickly
and
lifted
the
heavy
drapery
no
the
loggia
was
untenanted
and
breakfast
was
laid
for
one
that
was
the
first
chill
for
one
was
she
angry
at
his
drowsiness
good
god
what
could
it
mean
he
staggered
a
little
and
sat
on
the
bed
clutching
the
fine
sheet
and
as
he
did
so
it
disclosed
the
letter
and
the
flat
leather
case
which
had
fallen
from
the
pillow
and
become
hidden
in
the
clothes
a
deadly
faintness
came
over
paul
for
a
few
seconds
he
trembled
so
his
shaking
fingers
refused
to
hold
the
paper
then
with
a
mighty
effort
he
mastered
himself
and
tearing
the
envelope
open
began
to
read
it
was
a
wonderful
letter
the
last
passionate
cry
of
her
great
loving
heart
it
passed
in
review
their
glorious
days
in
burning
words
from
the
first
moment
of
their
meeting
and
then
towards
the
end
my
paul
she
wrote
that
first
night
you
were
my
caprice
and
afterwards
my
love
but
now
you
are
my
life
and
for
this
i
must
leave
you
to
save
that
life
sweet
lover
seek
me
not
heart
of
my
heart
believe
me
i
would
not
go
if
there
were
any
other
way
fate
is
too
strong
for
us
and
i
must
bow
my
head
were
i
to
remain
even
another
hour
all
dmitry
watching
could
not
keep
you
safe
darling
while
i
thought
they
menaced
me
alone
it
only
angered
me
but
now
i
know
that
you
would
pay
the
penalty
i
can
but
go
if
you
follow
me
it
will
mean
death
for
us
both
oh
paul
i
implore
you
by
our
great
love
go
into
safety
as
soon
as
you
can
you
must
leave
venice
and
return
straight
to
england
and
your
home
darling
beloved
lover
if
we
never
meet
again
in
this
sad
world
let
this
thought
stay
with
you
always
that
i
love
you
heart
and
mind
body
and
soul
i
am
utterly
and
forever
yours
as
he
read
the
last
words
the
room
became
dark
for
paul
and
he
fell
back
like
a
log
on
the
bed
the
paper
fluttering
to
the
floor
from
his
nerveless
fingers
she
was
gone
and
life
seemed
over
for
him
here
perhaps
an
hour
later
tompson
found
him
still
unconscious
and
in
terrified
haste
sent
off
for
a
doctor
and
telegraphed
to
sir
charles
verdayne
come
at
once
tompson
but
ere
his
father
could
arrive
on
sunday
paul
was
lying
life
and
death
madly
raving
with
brain
fever
and
thus
ended
the
three
weeks
of
his
episode
chapter
xxi
have
any
of
you
who
read
crept
back
to
life
from
nearly
beyond
the
grave
crept
back
to
find
it
shorn
of
all
that
made
it
fair
after
hours
of
delirium
to
awaken
in
great
weakness
to
a
sense
of
hideous
anguish
and
loss
to
the
prospect
of
days
of
aching
void
and
hopeless
longing
to
the
hourly
momentary
sting
of
remembrance
of
things
vaster
than
death
more
dear
than
life
itself
if
you
have
come
through
this
valley
of
the
shadow
then
you
can
know
what
the
first
days
of
returning
consciousness
meant
to
paul
he
never
really
questioned
the
finality
of
her
decree
he
it
meant
parting
for
ever
and
yet
with
that
spring
of
eternal
hope
which
animates
all
living
souls
unbidden
arguings
and
possibilities
rose
in
his
enfeebled
brain
and
deepened
his
unrest
thus
his
progress
towards
convalescence
was
long
and
slow
and
all
this
time
his
father
and
tompson
had
nursed
him
in
the
old
venetian
palazzo
with
tenderest
devotion
the
italian
servants
had
been
left
paid
up
for
a
month
but
the
lady
and
her
russian
retinue
had
vanished
leaving
no
trace
both
tompson
and
sir
charles
knew
almost
the
whole
story
now
from
ravings
and
neither
spoke
of
it
except
that
tompson
supplied
some
links
to
complete
sir
charles
picture
she
was
the
most
splendid
lady
you
could
wish
to
see
sir
charles
the
stolid
creature
finished
with
her
servants
worshipped
her
and
if
verdayne
is
ill
now
he
is
ill
for
no
less
than
a
queen
this
fact
comforted
tompson
greatly
but
paul
father
found
in
it
no
consolation
the
difficulty
had
been
to
prevent
his
mother
from
descending
upon
them
she
must
ever
be
kept
in
ignorance
of
this
episode
in
her
son
life
she
belonged
to
the
class
of
intellect
which
could
never
have
understood
it
would
have
been
an
undying
shock
and
horrified
grief
to
the
end
of
her
life
excellent
loving
conventional
lady
so
after
the
first
terrible
danger
was
over
sir
charles
made
light
of
their
son
illness
paul
and
he
were
enjoying
venice
he
said
and
would
soon
be
home
d
d
hard
luck
the
boy
getting
fever
like
this
he
wrote
in
his
laconic
style
but
one
never
could
trust
foreign
drains
and
the
lady
henrietta
waited
in
unsuspecting
patience
those
were
weary
days
for
every
one
concerned
it
wrung
his
father
heart
to
see
paul
prostrate
there
as
weak
as
an
infant
all
his
splendid
youth
and
strength
conquered
by
this
raging
blast
it
was
sad
to
have
to
listen
to
his
moan
darling
come
back
to
me
darling
my
queen
and
even
after
he
regained
consciousness
it
was
equally
pitiful
to
watch
him
lying
nerveless
and
white
blue
shadows
on
his
once
fresh
skin
and
most
pitiful
of
all
were
his
hands
now
veined
and
transparent
falling
idly
upon
the
sheet
but
at
least
the
father
realised
it
could
have
been
no
ordinary
woman
whose
going
caused
the
shock
which
even
after
a
life
of
three
weeks
continual
emotion
could
prostrate
his
young
hercules
she
must
have
been
worth
something
this
tiger
queen
and
one
day
contrary
to
his
usual
custom
he
addressed
tompson
what
sort
of
a
looking
woman
tompson
and
tompson
although
an
english
valet
did
not
reply
who
sir
charles
he
just
rounded
his
eyes
stolidly
and
said
in
his
monotonous
voice
she
was
that
a
man
could
say
when
he
got
close
she
kind
of
dazzled
him
she
had
black
hair
and
a
white
face
and
and
witch
eyes
but
she
was
very
kind
and
overpowering
haughty
and
generous
any
one
would
have
known
she
was
a
queen
young
asked
sir
charles
tompson
smoothed
his
chin
i
could
not
say
sir
charles
some
days
about
and
other
days
past
thirty
about
to
i
expect
she
was
if
the
truth
were
known
pretty
the
eyes
rounded
more
and
more
well
she
was
so
fascinatin
i
ca
say
sir
charles
the
most
lovely
lady
i
ever
did
see
at
times
sir
charles
humph
said
paul
father
and
then
relapsed
into
silence
she
a
beast
of
a
husband
he
might
have
been
a
king
but
he
was
no
gentleman
tompson
ventured
to
add
presently
fearing
the
humph
perhaps
meant
disapprobation
of
this
splendid
queen
her
servants
were
close
and
did
not
speak
good
english
so
i
could
not
get
much
out
of
them
but
the
man
vasili
who
came
the
last
days
did
say
in
a
funny
lingo
which
i
had
to
guess
at
as
how
he
expected
he
should
have
to
kill
him
some
time
vasili
had
a
scar
on
his
face
as
long
as
your
finger
that
he
got
defending
the
queen
from
her
husband
brutality
when
he
was
the
worse
for
drink
only
last
year
and
verdayne
is
so
handsome
it
is
no
wonder
sir
charles
that
will
do
tompson
said
sir
charles
and
he
frowned
the
fatal
letter
carefully
sealed
up
in
a
new
envelope
and
the
leather
case
were
in
his
tompson
had
handed
them
to
him
on
his
arrival
and
one
day
when
paul
appeared
well
enough
to
be
lifted
into
a
long
chair
on
the
side
loggia
his
father
thought
fit
to
give
them
to
him
paul
apathy
seemed
paralysing
the
days
had
passed
since
the
little
italian
doctor
had
pronounced
him
out
of
danger
in
one
unending
languid
quietude
he
expressed
interest
in
no
single
thing
he
was
polite
and
indifferent
and
numb
he
must
be
roused
now
sir
charles
said
to
the
doctor
it
is
too
hot
for
venice
he
must
be
moved
to
higher
air
and
the
little
man
had
nodded
his
head
so
this
warm
late
afternoon
as
he
lay
under
the
mosquito
curtains
which
the
coming
of
june
had
made
necessary
in
this
paradise
his
father
said
to
him
i
have
a
letter
and
a
parcel
of
yours
paul
you
had
better
look
at
them
we
hope
to
start
north
in
a
day
or
two
you
must
get
to
a
more
bracing
place
then
he
had
pushed
them
under
the
and
turned
his
back
on
the
scene
the
blood
rushed
to
paul
face
but
left
him
deathly
pale
after
a
few
moments
and
presently
he
broke
the
seal
the
minute
sphinx
in
the
corner
of
the
paper
seemed
to
mock
at
him
indeed
life
was
a
riddle
of
anguish
and
pain
he
read
the
letter
all
over
and
read
it
again
the
passionate
words
of
love
warmed
him
now
that
he
had
passed
the
agony
of
the
farewell
one
sentence
he
had
hardly
grasped
before
in
particular
held
balm
sweetheart
it
said
you
must
not
grieve
think
always
of
the
future
and
of
our
hope
our
love
is
not
dead
with
our
parting
and
one
day
there
will
be
the
living
sign
yes
that
thought
was
comfort
but
how
should
he
know
then
he
turned
to
the
leather
case
his
fingers
were
still
so
feeble
that
with
difficulty
he
pressed
the
spring
to
open
it
he
glanced
up
at
his
father
back
outlined
against
the
loggia
opening
arches
it
appeared
uncompromising
a
fixed
determination
to
stare
at
the
oleanders
below
seemed
the
only
spirit
animating
this
parent
yes
he
must
open
the
box
it
gave
suddenly
with
a
jerk
and
there
lay
a
dog
collar
made
of
small
flexible
plates
of
pure
beaten
gold
mounted
on
russian
leather
all
of
the
finest
workmanship
and
on
a
slip
of
paper
in
his
darling
own
writing
he
read
this
is
for
pike
my
beloved
one
let
him
wear
it
always
a
gift
from
me
on
the
collar
itself
finely
engraved
were
the
words
pike
belonging
to
paul
verdayne
then
the
floodgates
of
paul
numbed
soul
were
opened
a
great
sob
rose
in
his
breast
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
cried
like
a
child
oh
her
dear
thought
her
dear
tender
thought
for
pike
his
little
friend
and
sir
charles
made
believe
he
saw
nothing
as
he
stole
from
the
place
his
rugged
face
twitching
a
little
and
his
keen
eyes
dim
chapter
xxii
they
did
not
go
north
as
sir
charles
intended
an
unaccountable
reluctance
on
paul
part
to
return
through
switzerland
changed
their
plans
instead
by
a
fortunate
chance
the
large
schooner
yacht
of
a
rather
eccentric
old
friend
came
in
to
venice
and
the
father
eagerly
accepted
the
invitation
to
go
on
board
and
bring
his
invalid
the
owner
one
captain
grigsby
had
been
quite
alone
so
the
three
men
would
be
in
peace
and
nothing
could
be
better
for
paul
than
this
warm
sea
air
typhoid
fever
mark
grigsby
had
asked
no
sir
charles
had
replied
considerable
mental
tribulation
over
a
woman
d
d
kittle
cattle
was
captain
grigsby
polite
comment
a
fine
boy
too
and
promising
appears
to
have
been
almost
worth
while
sir
charles
added
from
what
i
gather
and
confound
it
grig
we
have
done
the
same
in
our
day
but
captain
grigsby
only
repeated
d
d
kittle
cattle
and
so
they
weighed
anchor
and
sailed
along
the
italian
shores
of
the
adriatic
these
were
better
days
for
paul
each
hour
brought
him
back
some
health
and
vigour
youth
and
strength
were
asserting
their
own
again
and
the
absence
of
familiar
objects
and
the
glory
of
the
air
and
the
blue
sea
helped
sometimes
to
deaden
the
poignant
agony
of
his
aching
heart
but
there
it
was
underneath
an
dull
anguish
and
only
when
he
became
sufficiently
strong
to
help
the
sailors
with
the
ropes
and
exert
physical
force
did
he
get
one
moment
respite
the
two
elder
men
watched
him
with
kind
furtive
eyes
but
they
never
questioned
him
or
made
the
slightest
allusion
to
his
travels
and
the
first
day
they
heard
him
laugh
sir
charles
looked
down
at
the
white
foam
because
a
mist
was
in
his
eyes
they
had
coasted
round
italy
and
sicily
and
not
among
the
ionian
isles
as
had
been
captain
grigsby
intention
i
fancy
the
lady
came
from
some
of
those
balkan
countries
sir
charles
had
said
do
let
us
get
in
touch
with
even
the
outside
of
one
of
them
and
mark
grigsby
had
grunted
an
assent
the
boy
is
a
fine
fellow
he
said
one
morning
as
they
looked
at
paul
hauling
ropes
he
probably
never
get
quite
over
this
but
he
is
fighting
like
a
man
charles
tell
me
as
much
as
you
feel
inclined
to
of
the
story
so
sir
charles
began
in
his
short
broken
sentences
parson
girl
to
start
with
sympathy
over
a
broken
the
wife
behaved
unwisely
about
it
so
the
boy
thought
he
was
in
love
we
sent
him
to
travel
to
get
rid
of
that
idea
it
appears
he
met
this
lady
in
lucerne
seems
to
have
been
an
exceptional
person
a
russian
tompson
says
a
queen
or
princess
the
fellow
tells
me
but
i
ca
spot
her
as
yet
hubert
will
know
who
she
was
though
but
it
does
not
matter
the
woman
herself
was
the
thing
gather
she
was
quite
a
remarkable
woman
ten
years
older
than
paul
always
the
case
growled
captain
grigsby
sir
charles
puffed
at
his
pipe
and
then
they
were
only
together
three
weeks
he
said
and
during
that
time
she
managed
to
cram
more
knowledge
of
everything
into
the
boy
head
than
you
and
i
have
got
in
a
lifetime
give
you
my
word
grig
when
he
was
off
his
chump
in
the
fever
he
raved
like
a
poet
and
an
orator
and
he
was
only
an
ordinary
sportsman
when
he
left
home
in
the
spring
cleopatra
he
called
her
one
day
and
i
fancy
that
was
the
keynote
she
must
have
been
one
of
those
exceptional
women
we
read
of
in
the
sixth
form
and
fortunately
never
met
said
captain
grigsby
i
do
know
mused
sir
charles
it
might
have
been
good
to
live
as
wildly
even
at
the
price
we
both
been
about
the
world
grig
since
the
days
we
fastened
on
our
cuirasses
together
for
the
first
time
and
each
thought
himself
the
devil
of
a
fine
fellow
but
i
rather
doubt
if
we
now
know
as
much
of
what
is
really
worth
having
as
my
boy
there
just
years
old
nonsense
snapped
captain
grigsby
but
there
was
a
tone
of
regret
in
his
protest
lucky
to
have
got
off
without
a
knife
or
a
bullet
through
him
dangerous
nations
to
grapple
with
he
said
yes
i
gather
some
pretty
heavy
menace
was
over
their
heads
and
that
is
what
made
the
lady
decamp
so
we
much
to
be
thankful
for
agreed
sir
charles
had
she
any
children
the
other
asked
tompson
says
no
rotten
fellow
the
husband
it
appears
and
no
heir
to
the
throne
or
principality
or
whatever
it
is
so
when
i
have
had
a
talk
with
hubert
henrietta
brother
you
know
the
one
in
the
diplomatic
service
it
will
be
easy
to
locate
her
gathered
paul
does
know
himself
pretty
romance
anyway
and
what
will
you
do
with
the
boy
now
charles
paul
father
puffed
quite
a
long
while
at
his
meerschaum
before
he
answered
and
then
his
voice
was
gruffer
than
ever
with
tenderness
suppressed
give
him
his
head
grig
he
said
he
true
blue
underneath
and
come
up
to
the
collar
in
time
old
friend
only
i
shall
have
to
keep
his
mother
love
from
harrying
him
best
and
greatest
lady
in
the
world
my
wife
but
she
rather
apt
to
jog
the
bridle
now
and
then
at
this
moment
paul
joined
them
his
paleness
showed
less
than
usual
beneath
the
sunburn
and
his
eyes
seemed
almost
bright
a
wave
of
thankful
gladness
filled
his
father
heart
thank
god
he
said
below
his
breath
thank
god
the
weather
had
been
perfection
hardly
a
drop
of
rain
and
just
the
gentlest
breezes
to
waft
them
slowly
along
a
suitable
soothing
idle
life
for
one
who
had
but
lately
been
near
death
and
each
day
paul
strength
returned
until
his
father
began
to
hope
they
might
still
be
home
for
his
birthday
the
last
day
of
july
they
had
crept
up
the
coast
of
italy
now
when
an
absolute
calm
fell
upon
them
and
just
opposite
the
temple
of
paestum
they
decided
to
anchor
for
the
night
for
the
last
evenings
as
the
moon
had
grown
larger
paul
had
been
strangely
restless
it
seemed
as
if
he
preferred
to
tire
himself
out
with
unnecessary
and
then
retire
to
his
berth
the
moment
that
dinner
was
over
rather
than
go
on
deck
his
face
too
which
had
been
controlled
as
a
mask
until
now
wore
a
look
of
haunting
anguish
which
was
grievous
to
see
he
ate
his
dinner
or
rather
pretended
to
play
with
the
food
in
absolute
silence
uneasiness
overcame
sir
charles
and
he
glanced
at
his
old
friend
but
paul
after
lighting
a
cigar
and
letting
it
out
once
or
twice
rose
and
murmuring
something
about
the
heat
went
up
on
deck
it
was
the
night
of
the
full
moon
eight
weeks
exactly
since
the
joy
of
life
had
finished
for
him
he
felt
he
could
not
bear
even
the
two
kindly
gentlemen
whose
unspoken
sympathy
he
knew
was
his
he
could
not
bear
anything
human
at
least
he
must
be
alone
with
his
grief
all
nature
was
in
a
mood
divine
they
were
close
enough
inshore
to
see
the
splendid
temples
clearly
with
the
naked
eye
the
sky
and
the
sea
were
of
the
colour
only
the
mediterranean
knows
it
was
hot
and
still
and
the
moon
in
her
pure
magnificence
cast
her
spell
not
a
sound
of
the
faintest
ripple
met
his
ear
the
sailors
supped
below
all
was
silence
on
one
side
the
vast
sea
on
the
other
the
shore
with
this
masterpiece
of
man
genius
the
temple
of
the
great
god
poseidon
in
this
vanished
settlement
of
the
old
greeks
how
marvellously
beautiful
it
all
was
and
how
his
queen
would
have
loved
it
how
she
would
have
told
him
its
history
and
woven
round
it
the
spirit
of
the
past
until
his
living
eyes
could
almost
have
seen
the
priests
and
the
people
and
heard
their
worshipping
prayers
his
darling
had
spoken
of
it
once
he
remembered
and
had
told
him
it
was
a
place
they
must
see
he
recollected
her
very
words
we
must
look
at
it
first
in
the
winter
from
the
shore
my
paul
and
see
those
splendid
proportions
outlined
against
the
sky
so
noble
and
so
perfectly
balanced
and
then
we
must
see
it
from
the
sea
with
the
background
of
the
olive
hills
it
is
ever
silent
and
deserted
and
calm
and
death
lurks
there
after
the
month
of
march
a
cruel
malaria
which
we
must
not
face
dear
love
but
if
we
could
we
ought
to
see
it
from
a
yacht
in
safety
in
the
summer
time
and
then
the
spell
would
fall
upon
us
and
we
would
know
it
was
true
that
really
grew
there
which
gave
the
world
their
blossoms
twice
a
year
that
was
the
legend
of
the
greeks
well
he
was
seeing
it
from
a
yacht
but
ah
god
seeing
it
alone
alone
and
where
was
she
so
intense
and
vivid
was
his
remembrance
of
her
that
he
could
feel
her
presence
near
if
he
turned
his
head
he
felt
he
should
see
her
standing
beside
him
her
strange
eyes
full
of
love
the
very
perfume
of
her
seemed
to
fill
the
air
her
golden
voice
to
whisper
in
his
ear
her
soul
to
mingle
with
his
soul
ah
yes
in
spirit
as
she
had
said
they
could
never
be
parted
more
a
suppressed
moan
of
anguish
escaped
his
lips
and
his
father
who
had
come
silently
behind
him
put
his
hand
on
his
arm
my
poor
boy
he
said
his
gruff
voice
hoarse
in
his
throat
if
only
to
god
i
could
do
something
for
you
oh
father
said
paul
and
the
two
men
looked
in
each
other
eyes
and
knew
each
other
as
never
before
chapter
xxiii
next
day
there
was
a
fresh
breeze
and
they
scudded
before
it
on
to
naples
here
paul
seemed
well
enough
to
take
train
and
so
arrive
in
england
in
time
for
his
birthday
he
owed
this
to
his
mother
he
and
his
father
both
felt
she
had
been
looking
forward
to
it
for
so
long
as
at
the
time
of
his
coming
of
age
the
festivities
had
been
interrupted
by
the
sudden
death
of
his
maternal
grandfather
and
the
people
had
all
been
promised
a
continuance
of
them
on
this
his
birthday
so
taking
the
journey
by
sufficiently
easy
stages
sleeping
three
nights
on
the
way
they
calculated
to
arrive
on
the
eve
of
the
event
the
lady
henrietta
would
have
everything
in
readiness
for
them
and
her
darling
paul
was
not
to
be
only
guests
of
the
most
congenial
kind
had
been
invited
and
such
a
number
of
nice
girls
the
prospect
was
perfectly
delightful
and
ought
to
cause
any
young
man
pure
joy
it
was
with
a
heart
as
heavy
as
lead
paul
mounted
the
broad
steps
of
his
ancestral
home
that
summer
evening
and
was
folded
in
his
arms
the
guests
were
all
fortunately
dressing
for
dinner
captain
grigsby
had
been
persuaded
to
abandon
his
yacht
and
accompany
them
too
yes
i
come
charles
he
said
getting
too
confoundedly
hot
in
these
seas
besides
the
boy
will
want
more
than
one
to
see
him
through
among
those
cackling
women
so
the
three
had
travelled
together
through
italy
and
france
switzerland
had
been
strictly
avoided
paul
darling
his
mother
exclaimed
in
a
voice
of
pained
surprise
as
she
stood
back
and
looked
at
him
but
surely
you
have
been
very
my
darling
darling
son
i
told
you
he
had
had
a
sharp
attack
of
fever
henrietta
interrupted
sir
charles
quickly
and
no
one
looks
their
best
after
travelling
in
this
grilling
weather
let
the
boy
get
to
his
bath
and
you
will
see
a
different
person
but
his
mother
loving
eyes
were
not
to
be
deceived
so
with
infinite
fuss
and
terms
of
endearment
she
insisted
upon
accompanying
her
offspring
to
his
room
where
the
dignified
housekeeper
was
summoned
and
his
every
imaginable
and
unimaginable
want
arranged
to
be
supplied
once
all
this
would
have
irritated
paul
to
the
verge
of
bearish
rudeness
but
now
he
only
kissed
his
mother
white
jewelled
hand
he
remembered
his
lady
tender
counsel
to
him
given
in
one
of
their
many
talks
you
must
always
reverence
your
mother
paul
and
accept
her
worship
with
love
so
now
he
said
dear
mother
it
is
so
good
of
you
but
i
all
right
fever
does
knock
one
over
a
bit
you
know
you
see
though
being
at
home
again
will
make
me
perfectly
well
in
no
time
and
i
be
as
good
as
you
like
and
eat
and
drink
all
elwyn
and
jellies
and
other
beastly
stuff
if
you
will
just
let
me
dress
now
like
a
darling
however
his
mother
was
obliged
to
examine
and
assure
herself
that
his
beautiful
hair
was
still
thick
and
waving
and
she
had
to
pause
and
sigh
over
every
sharpened
line
of
his
face
and
figure
though
the
thought
of
being
permitted
to
lavish
continuous
care
for
long
days
to
come
held
a
certain
consolation
for
her
at
last
paul
was
left
alone
and
there
came
a
moment
he
had
been
longing
for
he
had
sent
written
orders
that
tremlett
should
bring
pike
and
leave
him
in
his
beyond
and
all
the
while
his
mother
had
talked
he
had
heard
suppressed
whines
and
scratchings
somehow
he
had
not
wanted
to
see
his
dog
before
any
of
the
people
the
greeting
between
himself
and
his
little
friend
must
be
in
solitude
for
was
there
not
a
secret
link
between
them
in
that
golden
collar
given
by
his
queen
and
pike
would
understand
he
certainly
would
understand
if
short
passionate
barks
and
a
madness
of
wagging
accompanied
by
jumps
of
crazy
joy
could
comfort
any
one
then
paul
had
his
full
measure
when
the
door
was
opened
and
this
rough
white
terrier
bounded
in
upon
him
and
frantic
with
welcome
and
ecstasy
was
with
difficulty
quieted
at
last
in
his
master
fond
arms
oh
pike
pike
paul
said
while
tears
of
weakness
flowed
down
his
cheeks
i
can
talk
to
you
and
when
you
wear
her
collar
you
will
know
my
queen
our
queen
and
pike
said
everything
of
sympathy
a
dog
could
say
but
it
was
not
until
late
at
night
when
the
interminable
evening
had
been
got
through
that
his
master
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
his
darling
present
on
that
first
evening
of
his
homecoming
was
an
ordeal
for
paul
he
was
still
feeble
and
dead
tired
from
travelling
to
begin
with
and
to
have
to
listen
and
reply
to
the
endless
banalities
of
his
mother
guests
was
almost
more
than
he
could
bear
they
were
a
nice
cheery
company
of
mostly
young
friends
pretty
girls
and
his
own
boon
companions
abounded
and
they
chaffed
and
played
silly
games
after
dinner
until
paul
could
have
groaned
captain
grigsby
had
eventually
caught
sir
charles
eye
you
will
have
the
boy
fainting
if
you
do
get
him
off
alone
soon
he
said
these
girls
would
tire
a
man
in
strong
health
and
at
last
paul
had
escaped
to
his
own
room
he
leant
out
of
his
window
and
looked
at
the
gibbous
moon
pike
was
there
on
the
broad
sill
beside
him
under
his
arm
and
he
could
feel
the
golden
collar
on
the
soft
fur
neck
a
wave
of
perhaps
the
most
hopeless
anguish
he
had
yet
felt
was
upon
his
spirit
now
the
unutterable
blankness
the
impossible
vista
of
the
endless
days
to
come
with
no
prospect
of
meeting
no
aim
no
hope
yes
she
had
said
there
was
one
hope
one
hope
which
could
bring
peace
to
their
crud
unrest
but
how
and
when
should
he
ever
know
and
if
it
were
so
then
more
than
ever
he
should
be
by
her
side
the
number
of
beautiful
things
he
would
want
to
say
to
her
about
it
all
the
oceans
of
love
he
would
desire
to
pour
upon
her
the
tender
care
which
should
be
his
hourly
joy
to
honour
and
worship
her
and
chase
all
pain
away
and
he
did
not
even
know
her
name
or
the
country
where
one
day
this
hope
should
reign
that
was
incredible
and
it
would
be
so
easy
to
find
out
but
he
had
promised
her
never
to
make
inquiries
and
he
would
keep
his
word
he
saw
her
reason
now
it
had
arisen
in
an
instinct
of
tender
protection
for
himself
she
had
known
if
he
knew
her
place
of
abode
no
fear
of
death
would
keep
him
from
trying
to
see
her
ah
he
had
had
the
tears
and
why
not
the
cold
steel
and
blood
it
was
no
price
to
pay
could
he
but
hear
once
more
her
golden
voice
and
feel
her
loving
twining
arms
he
was
only
held
back
by
the
fear
of
the
danger
for
her
and
instead
of
being
with
her
and
waiting
on
her
footsteps
he
should
have
to
spend
his
next
hours
with
those
ridiculous
englishwomen
those
foolish
flippant
girls
one
had
quoted
poetry
to
him
at
dinner
the
very
scrap
his
lady
had
spoken
a
line
of
this
new
poet
who
was
taking
the
world
of
london
by
storm
that
year
loved
with
a
love
beyond
all
words
or
sense
and
it
had
sounded
like
bathos
or
sacrilege
what
did
these
dolls
know
of
love
or
life
chattering
parrots
to
weary
a
man
brain
yes
the
greeks
were
right
it
would
be
better
to
keep
them
spinning
flax
and
uneducated
and
so
in
his
young
intolerance
maddened
by
pain
he
saw
all
things
gibbous
like
the
mocking
moon
pike
stirred
under
his
arm
and
licked
his
hand
a
faint
whine
of
love
making
itself
heard
in
the
night
o
god
said
paul
as
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
let
me
get
through
this
time
as
she
would
have
me
do
let
me
not
show
the
anguish
in
my
heart
but
be
at
least
a
man
and
gentleman
chapter
xxiv
the
neighbours
and
his
parents
were
astonished
at
the
eloquence
of
speech
at
the
great
dinner
given
to
the
tenants
next
day
no
one
had
guessed
at
his
powers
before
and
the
county
papers
and
indeed
some
london
reporters
had
predicted
a
splendid
political
future
for
this
young
orator
it
had
been
quite
a
long
speech
and
contained
sound
arguments
and
common
sense
and
was
expressed
in
language
so
lofty
and
refined
that
it
sent
ecstatic
admiration
through
his
mother
fond
breast
and
all
the
time
paul
spoke
he
saw
no
sea
of
faces
below
him
only
his
soul
eyes
were
looking
into
those
strange
chameleon
orbs
of
his
lady
he
said
every
word
as
if
she
had
been
there
and
at
the
end
it
almost
seemed
she
must
have
heard
him
so
soft
a
peace
fell
on
his
spirit
yes
she
would
have
been
pleased
with
her
lover
he
knew
and
that
held
large
grains
of
consolation
and
so
these
days
passed
in
duty
and
at
last
all
the
festivities
were
over
and
he
could
rest
captain
grigsby
and
his
father
had
helped
him
whenever
they
could
and
an
eternal
bond
of
friendship
was
cemented
between
the
three
by
jove
charles
you
ought
to
be
thundering
proud
of
that
boy
captain
grigsby
said
the
morning
of
his
departure
for
scotland
on
august
come
up
to
the
scratch
like
a
hero
and
whatever
the
damage
the
lady
must
have
been
well
worth
while
to
turn
him
out
polished
like
that
gad
charles
i
take
a
month
journey
to
see
her
myself
and
paul
father
grunted
with
satisfaction
as
he
said
i
told
you
so
thus
the
summer
days
went
by
in
the
strengthening
of
character
trying
always
to
live
up
to
an
ideal
trying
ever
to
dominate
his
grief
but
never
trying
to
forget
by
the
autumn
shooting
time
his
health
was
quite
restored
and
except
that
he
looked
a
year
or
so
older
there
were
no
outward
traces
of
the
passing
through
that
valley
of
the
shadow
from
whence
he
had
escaped
with
just
his
life
but
the
three
weeks
of
his
lady
influence
had
changed
the
inner
man
beyond
all
recognition
his
spirit
was
stamped
with
her
nameless
distinction
and
all
the
vistas
she
had
opened
for
him
to
the
tree
of
knowledge
he
now
followed
up
no
smallest
incident
of
his
day
seemed
unconnected
with
some
thought
or
wish
of
hers
so
that
in
truth
she
still
guided
and
moulded
him
by
the
power
of
her
great
soul
but
in
spite
of
all
these
things
the
weeks
and
months
held
hours
of
aching
longing
and
increasing
anxiety
to
know
how
she
fared
if
she
should
be
ill
if
their
hope
was
coming
true
then
now
she
must
be
suffering
and
suffering
all
alone
sometimes
the
agony
of
the
thought
was
more
than
paul
could
bear
and
took
him
off
with
pike
alone
into
the
leafless
woods
which
crowned
a
hill
at
the
top
of
the
park
and
then
he
would
pause
and
look
out
at
the
view
and
the
dull
november
sky
a
madness
of
agonising
unrest
torturing
his
heart
the
one
thing
he
felt
glad
of
was
the
absence
of
his
uncle
hubert
who
had
been
made
minister
in
a
south
american
republic
and
would
not
return
to
england
for
more
than
a
year
so
there
would
be
no
temptation
to
question
him
or
perchance
to
hear
one
of
his
clever
evil
jests
which
might
contain
some
allusion
to
his
lady
lord
hubert
aldringham
was
fond
of
boasting
of
his
royal
acquaintances
and
was
of
a
mind
that
found
not
even
lancelot
brave
nor
galahad
clean
now
all
paul
could
do
was
to
wait
and
hope
at
least
his
queen
had
his
address
she
could
write
to
him
even
though
he
could
not
write
to
her
and
surely
surely
some
news
of
her
must
come
thus
the
winter
arrived
and
the
hunting
hunting
that
he
had
been
sure
was
what
he
liked
best
in
all
the
world
and
now
it
just
served
to
pass
the
time
and
distract
some
hours
from
the
anguishing
ache
by
its
physical
pleasure
but
in
that
as
in
everything
he
did
at
this
time
paul
tried
to
outshine
his
fellows
and
gain
one
more
laurel
to
lay
at
the
feet
of
his
queen
socially
he
was
having
an
immense
success
he
began
to
be
known
as
some
one
worth
listening
to
by
men
and
women
hung
on
his
words
it
was
peculiarly
delightful
to
find
so
young
and
beautiful
a
creature
with
all
the
knowledge
and
fascinating
of
a
man
of
the
world
and
then
his
complete
indifference
to
them
piqued
and
allured
them
still
more
always
polite
and
chivalrous
but
as
aloof
as
a
mountain
top
paul
had
no
small
vanity
to
be
soothed
by
their
worship
into
forgetting
for
one
moment
his
queen
so
his
passed
and
his
experience
of
life
grew
isabella
had
returned
at
christmas
engaged
to
a
high
church
curate
and
beaming
with
satisfaction
and
health
and
it
gave
paul
and
indeed
them
both
pleasure
to
meet
and
talk
for
an
hour
she
was
a
good
sort
always
and
if
he
marvelled
to
himself
how
he
had
even
been
even
mildly
attracted
by
her
he
did
not
let
it
appear
in
his
manner
but
one
thing
jarred
my
goodness
paul
how
smart
pike
collar
is
isabella
had
said
did
you
ever
you
extravagant
boy
it
is
good
enough
for
a
lady
bracelet
you
had
better
give
it
to
me
it
will
make
the
finest
wedding
gift
i
have
but
paul
had
snatched
pike
up
the
blood
burning
in
his
cheeks
and
had
laughed
awkwardly
and
turned
the
conversation
no
one
fingers
but
his
own
were
ever
allowed
to
touch
the
sacred
gold
about
this
time
his
mother
began
to
have
the
idea
he
ought
really
to
marry
his
father
had
been
thirty
at
the
time
of
his
wedding
with
herself
and
she
had
always
thought
that
was
starting
too
late
was
a
good
age
and
a
sweet
gentle
wife
of
paul
would
be
the
joy
of
her
declining
years
to
say
nothing
of
several
grandchildren
but
when
this
matter
was
broached
to
him
first
paul
laughed
and
when
it
became
a
daily
subject
of
conversation
he
almost
lost
that
quick
temper
of
his
which
was
not
quite
yet
under
perfect
control
i
tell
you
what
it
is
mother
he
said
if
you
tease
me
like
this
i
shall
go
away
on
a
voyage
round
the
world
so
the
lady
henrietta
subsided
into
pained
silence
and
sulked
with
her
adored
son
for
more
than
a
day
paul
is
so
unaccountably
changed
since
his
visit
abroad
she
said
to
her
husband
plaintively
i
sometimes
wonder
charles
if
we
really
know
all
the
people
he
met
and
sir
charles
had
replied
nonsense
henrietta
the
lad
is
a
man
now
and
immensely
improved
do
leave
him
in
peace
but
when
he
was
alone
the
father
had
smiled
to
himself
rather
sadly
for
he
saw
a
good
deal
with
his
shrewd
eyes
though
he
said
no
words
of
sympathy
to
his
son
he
knew
that
paul
was
suffering
still
perhaps
as
keenly
as
ever
and
he
honoured
his
determination
to
keep
it
all
from
view
so
the
old
year
died
and
the
new
one
came
and
soon
february
would
be
here
ah
with
what
passionate
anxiety
the
end
of
that
month
was
awaited
by
paul
only
his
own
heart
knew
chapter
xxv
the
days
passed
on
march
had
almost
come
and
paul
heard
nothing
his
father
noticed
the
daily
look
of
strain
and
his
mother
anxiously
inquired
if
he
were
dull
and
if
he
would
not
like
her
to
have
some
people
to
stay
and
thus
divert
him
in
some
fashion
and
paul
had
answered
with
what
grace
he
could
an
intense
temptation
came
over
him
to
read
all
the
court
news
he
longed
to
pick
up
the
ladies
papers
he
saw
in
his
mother
such
journals
he
knew
delighted
to
publish
the
doings
of
royal
lives
but
the
stern
which
now
he
practised
in
all
the
ruling
of
his
life
prevented
him
no
he
had
promised
never
to
investigate
and
neither
in
the
letter
nor
the
spirit
would
he
break
his
word
whatever
the
suffering
the
news
when
it
came
must
be
from
his
beloved
one
direct
but
oh
the
unrest
of
these
hours
had
their
hope
come
true
and
how
was
she
the
days
passed
in
a
gnawing
anxiety
he
was
so
restless
he
could
hardly
fix
his
attention
on
anything
it
required
the
whole
of
his
will
to
keep
him
taking
in
the
sense
of
the
parliamentary
books
which
were
now
his
study
the
constant
query
would
raise
its
head
between
each
page
what
news
of
my
queen
what
news
of
my
queen
each
mail
as
it
came
in
made
his
heart
beat
and
often
his
hand
trembled
as
he
lifted
his
pile
of
letters
but
no
sight
of
her
writing
gladdened
his
eyes
until
he
began
to
be
like
the
sea
and
its
tides
rising
twice
a
day
in
a
rushing
hope
with
the
posts
and
sinking
again
in
disappointment
he
grew
to
look
haggard
and
his
father
heart
ached
for
him
in
silence
at
length
one
morning
when
he
had
almost
trained
himself
not
to
glance
at
his
correspondence
which
came
as
he
was
dawdling
over
an
early
breakfast
his
eye
caught
a
letter
lying
on
the
top
it
was
no
hand
he
knew
but
something
told
him
it
contained
a
message
from
his
queen
he
dominated
himself
he
would
not
even
look
at
the
postmark
until
he
was
away
up
in
his
own
room
no
eye
but
pike
must
see
his
joy
or
sorrow
and
disappointment
and
so
the
letter
burnt
in
his
pocket
until
his
sanctum
was
reached
and
then
with
agonised
impatience
he
opened
the
envelope
within
was
another
of
the
familiar
paper
he
knew
and
ah
thank
god
addressed
in
pencil
in
his
lady
own
hand
inside
it
contained
an
enclosure
but
the
sheet
was
blank
with
wildly
beating
heart
and
trembling
fingers
paul
undid
the
smaller
packet
folded
ends
and
there
the
morning
sunbeams
fell
on
a
tiny
curl
of
hair
of
that
peculiar
nondescript
shade
of
infant
fairness
which
later
would
turn
to
gold
it
was
less
than
an
inch
long
and
of
the
fineness
of
down
while
in
tender
care
it
had
been
tied
with
a
thread
of
blue
silk
written
on
the
paper
underneath
were
the
words
beloved
he
is
so
strong
and
fair
thy
son
born
the
of
february
for
a
moment
paul
closed
his
eyes
and
as
once
before
a
choir
of
seraphims
were
singing
in
his
ears
then
he
looked
at
this
minute
lock
again
and
touched
it
with
his
forefinger
the
strangest
emotion
he
had
ever
known
quivered
through
his
being
the
concentrated
sensation
of
what
he
used
to
feel
when
his
lady
had
spoken
of
their
hope
a
weird
tremulous
physical
thrill
the
dear
small
curl
of
hair
the
actual
tangible
proof
of
his
own
living
son
he
lifted
it
with
the
greatest
reverence
to
his
lips
and
a
mist
of
joy
swam
in
his
blue
eyes
ah
it
was
all
too
wonderful
too
divine
the
thought
the
essence
of
their
great
love
this
child
of
his
and
hers
his
and
hers
yes
their
hope
had
not
deceived
them
it
was
true
it
was
true
then
his
mind
rose
in
passionate
worship
of
his
lady
his
goddess
and
queen
the
mainspring
of
his
watch
of
life
the
supreme
and
absolute
mistress
of
his
heart
and
soul
never
had
he
more
madly
desired
and
loved
her
than
this
day
he
kissed
and
kissed
her
words
in
deep
devotion
but
how
and
where
was
she
was
she
well
was
she
ill
had
she
been
suffering
oh
that
he
could
fly
to
her
more
than
ever
the
terrible
gall
of
their
separation
came
to
him
it
was
his
right
by
every
law
of
nature
to
now
be
by
her
side
but
she
was
well
she
must
be
well
or
she
would
have
said
and
surely
he
soon
would
see
her
it
was
like
a
voice
from
heaven
her
little
written
words
bridging
the
impossible
drawing
him
back
to
the
knowledge
and
certainty
that
she
was
there
for
him
to
love
and
one
day
to
go
to
fate
could
never
be
so
unjust
as
to
part
him
from
the
mother
of
his
child
and
then
a
state
of
mad
ecstasy
came
over
paul
with
that
vision
he
could
not
stay
in
the
house
he
must
go
out
under
god
sky
and
let
his
fly
into
space
dazzling
pictures
came
to
him
surely
the
spring
was
in
his
heart
breaking
through
the
frozen
ground
like
a
single
golden
crocus
he
saw
at
his
feet
surely
surely
the
sun
of
life
would
shine
again
and
living
he
should
see
her
he
strode
away
pike
gambolling
beside
him
and
racing
ahead
and
back
again
seeming
to
understand
and
participate
in
his
master
inward
joy
paul
hardly
noticed
where
he
went
his
thoughts
exalting
him
so
that
he
did
not
even
heed
to
choose
his
favourite
haunt
the
wood
against
the
it
was
as
if
great
blocks
of
icy
fear
and
anguish
were
melting
in
the
warmth
hope
and
glory
shone
on
his
path
almost
blinding
him
he
left
the
park
far
behind
and
struck
away
across
the
moor
as
he
passed
some
gipsy
vans
a
swarthy
young
woman
looked
out
an
infant
in
her
arms
and
gave
him
a
smiling
greeting
but
paul
stopped
and
said
tossing
her
a
sovereign
with
laughing
cheery
words
for
her
little
child
and
so
passed
on
his
glad
face
radiant
as
the
morn
but
the
woman
called
after
him
in
gratitude
blessings
on
your
honour
your
own
will
grace
a
throne
and
the
strange
coincidence
of
her
prophecy
set
fresh
thrills
of
delight
bounding
in
paul
veins
he
walked
and
walked
stopping
to
lunch
at
an
inn
miles
away
he
could
not
bear
even
to
see
his
parents
or
the
familiar
scenes
at
home
and
as
once
before
he
had
felt
in
his
grief
he
and
his
joy
must
be
alone
when
he
turned
to
come
back
in
the
late
afternoon
the
torrent
of
his
wild
happiness
had
crystallised
itself
into
coherent
thought
and
question
surely
she
would
send
him
some
more
words
and
make
some
plan
to
see
him
but
at
least
he
was
in
touch
with
her
again
and
knew
she
was
his
own
his
own
the
silence
had
broken
and
human
ingenuity
would
find
some
way
of
meeting
the
postmark
was
vienna
though
that
meant
nothing
at
all
she
could
have
sent
dmitry
there
to
post
the
letter
but
at
best
even
if
it
were
russia
a
few
days
journey
only
separated
him
from
his
darling
and
his
son
then
the
realisation
of
that
proud
fact
of
parenthood
came
over
him
again
he
said
the
words
aloud
my
son
and
with
a
cry
of
wild
exaltation
he
vaulted
a
gate
like
a
schoolboy
and
ran
along
the
path
pike
bounding
in
the
air
in
frantic
sympathy
thus
paul
returned
to
his
home
again
hope
singing
in
his
heart
but
even
his
father
did
not
guess
why
that
night
at
dinner
he
raised
his
champagne
glass
and
drank
a
silent
toast
his
eyes
gazing
into
distance
as
if
he
there
saw
heaven
chapter
xxvi
of
course
as
the
days
went
by
the
sparkle
of
paul
joy
subsided
an
infinite
unrest
took
its
place
a
continual
mad
desire
for
further
news
supposing
she
were
ill
his
darling
one
many
times
a
day
he
read
her
words
the
pencil
writing
was
certainly
feeble
and
shaky
supposing
but
he
refused
to
face
any
terrible
picture
the
letter
had
come
on
the
of
march
his
son
had
been
eleven
days
old
then
two
days
and
a
half
to
vienna
that
brought
it
to
eight
when
the
letter
was
posted
and
from
whence
had
it
come
there
if
he
allowed
two
days
more
say
she
must
have
written
it
only
five
or
six
days
after
the
baby
birth
paul
knew
very
little
about
such
things
though
he
understood
vaguely
that
a
woman
might
possibly
be
very
ill
even
after
then
but
surely
if
so
anna
or
dmitry
would
have
told
him
on
their
own
initiative
this
thought
comforted
him
a
little
but
still
anxiety
like
a
pursued
his
every
moment
he
would
not
leave
home
london
saw
him
not
even
for
a
day
some
word
might
come
in
his
absence
some
message
or
summons
to
go
to
her
and
he
would
not
chance
being
out
of
its
reach
more
than
ever
all
their
three
weeks
of
happiness
was
lived
over
again
every
word
she
had
said
had
sunk
for
ever
in
his
memory
and
away
in
his
solitary
walks
or
his
rides
home
from
hunting
in
the
dusk
of
the
afternoon
he
let
them
echo
in
his
heart
but
the
desire
to
be
near
her
was
growing
an
obsession
some
days
when
a
wild
gallop
had
made
his
blood
run
triumphant
thoughts
of
his
son
would
come
to
him
how
he
should
love
to
teach
him
to
sit
a
horse
in
days
to
come
to
ride
to
hounds
and
shoot
and
be
an
english
gentleman
oh
why
was
she
a
queen
his
loved
one
and
far
away
why
not
here
and
his
wife
whom
he
could
cover
with
devotion
and
honour
surely
that
would
be
enough
for
them
both
a
life
of
trust
and
love
and
sweetness
but
even
if
it
were
not
there
was
the
world
to
choose
from
if
only
they
were
together
the
two
paul
and
his
father
were
a
silent
pair
for
the
most
part
as
they
jogged
along
the
lanes
on
their
way
back
from
hunting
one
afternoon
when
this
sense
of
parenthood
was
strong
upon
paul
he
went
in
to
tea
in
his
mother
and
as
he
leant
upon
the
mantelpiece
his
tall
splendid
figure
in
its
scarlet
coat
outlined
against
the
bright
blaze
his
eye
took
in
perhaps
for
the
first
time
the
immense
number
of
portraits
of
himself
which
decorated
this
apartment
himself
in
every
stage
from
infantile
days
upward
through
the
toy
period
to
the
real
dog
companion
in
eton
collars
and
fourth
of
june
hats
in
cricketing
flannels
and
oxford
bullingdon
groups
and
then
not
so
many
until
one
taken
last
year
how
young
it
looked
and
smiling
there
was
one
particular
miniature
of
him
in
the
holy
of
holiest
positions
in
the
centre
of
the
a
real
work
of
art
well
painted
on
ivory
it
was
mounted
in
a
frame
of
fine
pearls
and
engraved
with
the
name
and
date
at
the
back
paul
verdayne
aged
five
years
and
three
months
it
was
a
picture
of
him
standing
next
a
great
chair
in
a
blue
velvet
suit
and
a
lace
collar
while
curls
of
brightest
gold
fell
rippling
to
his
neck
rather
short
bunchy
curls
which
evidently
would
not
be
repressed
was
i
ever
like
that
mother
he
said
and
the
lady
henrietta
only
too
enchanted
to
expand
upon
this
enthralling
subject
launched
forth
on
a
full
description
like
it
of
course
only
much
more
beautiful
no
child
had
ever
had
such
golden
curls
or
such
eyes
or
no
child
had
ever
in
fact
been
able
to
compare
with
him
in
any
way
or
ever
would
the
lady
delicate
cheeks
flushed
rose
with
joy
at
the
recollection
darling
mother
said
paul
as
he
kissed
her
how
you
loved
me
and
how
cold
i
have
often
been
forgive
me
then
he
was
silent
while
she
fondled
him
in
peace
his
thoughts
turning
as
ever
to
his
lady
she
too
probably
would
be
foolish
and
tender
and
sweet
over
her
son
and
how
his
mother
would
love
her
grandchild
oh
how
cruel
how
cruel
was
fate
then
he
asked
mother
does
it
take
women
a
long
time
to
get
well
when
they
have
children
ladies
i
mean
who
are
finely
nurtured
they
generally
get
well
though
do
they
and
it
is
quite
simple
and
the
lady
henrietta
blushed
as
she
answered
oh
yes
quite
simple
unless
some
complications
occur
of
course
there
is
always
a
faint
danger
but
then
it
is
so
well
worth
it
what
a
strange
thing
to
ask
though
dear
boy
were
you
thinking
of
cousin
agatha
cousin
agatha
said
paul
vaguely
and
then
recollected
himself
oh
yes
of
course
how
is
she
but
when
he
went
off
to
his
room
to
change
his
mother
words
stayed
with
him
unless
some
complications
occur
and
the
thought
opened
a
fresh
field
of
anxious
wonderment
at
last
it
all
seemed
unbearable
a
wild
idea
of
rushing
off
to
vienna
came
to
him
to
rush
there
on
the
clue
of
a
postmark
but
common
sense
put
this
aside
it
might
be
the
means
of
just
missing
some
message
no
he
must
bear
things
and
wait
this
silence
perhaps
meant
good
news
and
if
by
the
end
of
april
nothing
came
then
he
should
have
to
break
his
promise
and
investigate
about
this
time
captain
grigsby
again
came
to
stay
with
them
and
the
next
day
as
he
and
his
host
smoked
their
pipes
while
they
walked
up
and
down
the
sunny
terrace
he
took
occasion
to
give
forth
this
information
i
say
charles
i
have
located
her
have
you
no
by
jove
said
paul
father
hubert
is
away
you
know
and
i
have
just
let
the
thing
slide
about
the
end
of
february
did
you
notice
the
boy
looking
at
all
worried
sir
charles
thought
a
moment
yes
i
recollect
d
d
worried
and
restless
and
he
is
again
now
ah
i
thought
so
said
mark
grigsby
as
though
he
could
say
a
good
deal
more
well
then
out
with
it
grig
sir
charles
said
impatiently
and
captain
grigsby
proceeded
in
his
own
style
to
weave
together
a
chain
of
coincidences
which
had
struck
him
until
this
final
certainty
they
were
a
clear
set
of
arguments
and
paul
father
was
convinced
too
you
see
tompson
told
you
in
the
beginning
she
was
russian
captain
grigsby
said
after
talking
for
some
time
and
the
rest
was
easy
to
find
out
we
not
here
to
judge
the
morals
of
the
affair
charles
you
and
i
can
only
be
thundering
glad
your
grandson
will
sit
on
that
throne
all
right
he
had
read
in
one
paper
he
proceeded
to
say
that
a
most
difficult
political
situation
had
been
avoided
by
the
birth
of
this
child
as
there
was
no
possible
heir
at
all
and
immense
complications
would
ensue
upon
the
death
of
the
present
ruler
the
scurrilous
rag
even
gave
a
of
this
ruler
dissolute
life
and
a
broad
hint
that
the
child
could
in
no
case
be
his
but
as
they
pithily
remarked
this
added
to
the
little
welcome
in
ministerial
circles
where
the
lady
was
greatly
beloved
and
revered
and
the
king
had
only
been
put
upon
his
tottering
throne
and
kept
there
by
the
fact
of
being
her
husband
the
paper
added
the
king
had
taken
the
chief
part
in
the
rejoicings
over
the
heir
so
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
there
were
hints
also
of
his
mad
fits
of
debauchery
and
drunkenness
and
a
suppressed
tale
of
how
in
one
of
them
he
had
strangled
a
keeper
and
had
often
threatened
the
queen
life
her
brother
however
was
with
her
now
and
would
see
russian
supremacy
was
not
upset
husband
seems
a
likely
character
to
hobnob
with
do
he
charles
no
wonder
she
turned
her
eye
on
paul
eh
mark
grigsby
ended
with
but
sir
charles
answered
not
his
thoughts
were
full
of
his
son
all
the
forces
of
nature
and
emotion
seemed
to
be
drawing
him
away
from
peaceful
england
towards
a
hornets
nest
and
he
his
father
would
be
powerless
to
prevent
it
chapter
xxvii
april
days
were
lengthening
out
in
showers
and
sunshine
and
cold
east
wind
easter
and
a
huge
party
had
come
and
gone
at
verdayne
place
and
the
lady
henrietta
had
had
her
hopes
once
more
blighted
by
noticing
indomitable
indifference
to
all
the
pretty
girls
he
was
going
to
stand
for
parliament
in
the
autumn
when
their
very
old
member
should
retire
and
he
made
that
an
excuse
for
his
isolation
he
was
working
too
hard
for
social
functions
he
said
but
in
reality
life
was
growing
more
than
he
could
bear
captain
grigsby
had
sold
the
old
and
bought
a
new
steam
yacht
of
seven
hundred
tons
large
enough
to
take
him
round
the
world
he
said
and
he
had
had
her
put
in
commission
for
the
mediterranean
and
she
was
waiting
for
him
now
at
marseilles
would
paul
join
him
for
a
trip
he
asked
and
paul
hesitated
for
a
moment
if
no
news
came
by
friday
this
was
a
monday
then
he
should
go
to
london
and
deliberately
find
out
his
lady
name
and
kingdom
in
that
case
to
cruise
in
those
waters
might
suit
his
book
passing
well
so
he
asked
for
a
few
days
grace
and
captain
grigsby
gave
a
friendly
growl
in
reply
and
thus
it
was
settled
by
saturday
he
was
to
give
his
answer
tuesday
passed
and
wednesday
and
on
thursday
a
telegram
came
for
paul
which
drove
him
mad
with
joy
it
was
short
and
to
the
point
meet
dmitry
in
paris
then
followed
an
address
by
rushing
things
he
could
just
catch
the
night
boat
he
went
to
his
father
room
where
sir
charles
was
discussing
affairs
with
his
land
steward
the
man
retired
father
said
paul
i
am
going
immediately
to
paris
i
have
not
even
time
to
wait
and
see
my
mother
she
is
out
driving
i
hear
will
you
understand
father
and
make
it
all
right
with
her
and
sir
charles
said
as
he
wrung
his
son
hand
take
care
of
yourself
paul
i
understand
my
boy
and
remember
grig
and
i
are
with
you
to
the
bone
wire
if
you
want
us
and
let
me
have
your
news
so
they
had
parted
without
fuss
deep
feeling
in
their
hearts
paul
had
telegraphed
to
the
address
given
for
dmitry
that
he
would
be
in
paris
and
at
what
hotel
by
the
following
morning
he
chose
a
large
caravanserai
as
being
more
suitable
to
unremarked
comings
and
goings
should
dmitry
visit
be
anything
of
a
secret
one
and
with
intense
impatience
he
awaited
the
faithful
servant
visit
he
was
eating
his
early
breakfast
in
his
when
the
old
man
appeared
in
all
the
journey
paul
had
not
allowed
himself
any
speculation
he
would
see
and
know
soon
that
was
enough
but
he
felt
inclined
to
grind
this
retainer
hand
with
joy
as
he
made
his
respectful
obeisance
the
excellency
was
well
yes
and
now
for
his
news
madame
had
bid
him
come
and
see
the
excellency
here
in
paris
as
not
being
so
inaccessible
as
england
and
first
yes
madame
was
well
there
was
something
in
his
voice
as
he
said
this
which
made
paul
exclaim
and
question
him
closely
but
he
would
only
repeat
that
yes
his
lady
was
well
a
little
delicate
still
but
well
and
the
son
was
well
too
his
lady
had
told
him
to
assure
the
excellency
and
was
the
portrait
of
his
most
illustrious
father
and
the
old
man
lowered
his
eyes
while
paul
looked
out
of
the
window
and
thrilled
all
over
circumstances
made
things
very
difficult
for
madame
to
leave
the
southern
country
where
she
was
at
present
but
she
had
a
very
strong
desire
to
see
the
excellency
again
if
such
meeting
could
be
managed
he
paused
and
paul
exclaimed
that
of
course
it
could
be
managed
and
he
could
start
that
night
but
dmitry
shook
his
head
that
would
be
impossible
he
said
much
planning
would
be
needed
first
a
yacht
must
be
taken
and
not
until
the
end
of
may
would
it
be
safe
for
the
excellency
to
journey
south
at
that
time
madame
would
be
in
a
château
on
the
seacoast
and
if
the
excellency
in
his
cruise
could
be
within
sight
he
might
possibly
land
at
a
suitable
moment
and
see
her
for
a
few
hours
paul
thought
of
captain
grigsby
i
will
come
in
a
yacht
whenever
i
may
he
said
to
dmitry
so
they
began
to
settle
details
paul
imagined
from
dmitry
continuing
to
call
his
queen
plain
madame
that
she
still
wished
to
preserve
her
incognito
so
madly
as
he
desired
to
know
he
would
wait
until
he
saw
her
face
to
face
and
then
ask
to
be
released
from
his
promise
the
time
had
come
when
he
could
bear
the
mystery
no
longer
but
he
would
not
question
dmitry
all
his
force
was
turned
to
extracting
every
detail
of
his
darling
health
and
from
the
old
servant
and
in
his
guarded
respectful
manner
he
answered
all
he
could
his
lady
had
indeed
been
very
ill
paul
gathered
at
death
door
ah
this
was
terrible
to
hear
but
lately
she
was
mending
rapidly
only
she
had
been
too
ill
to
plan
or
make
any
arrangements
to
see
him
how
all
this
made
his
heart
ache
something
had
told
him
his
passionate
anxiety
had
not
been
without
cause
dmitry
continued
madame
life
was
not
a
happy
one
the
excellency
must
know
and
the
difficulties
surrounding
her
had
become
formidable
once
or
twice
however
the
brother
of
madame
was
with
her
now
and
had
been
made
guardian
of
her
son
so
things
were
peaceful
and
the
cause
of
all
her
trouble
would
not
dare
to
menace
further
for
once
dmitry
had
let
himself
go
as
he
spoke
and
a
passionate
hate
appeared
in
his
quiet
eyes
the
trouble
was
of
so
impossible
a
viciousness
that
only
the
nobility
and
goodness
of
madame
had
prevented
his
assassination
numbers
of
times
he
was
hated
he
said
hated
and
loathed
his
life
spent
in
continual
drunkenness
and
worse
unspeakable
wickedness
was
not
worth
a
day
purchase
but
for
her
the
son
of
madame
would
be
loved
forever
for
her
sake
so
the
excellency
need
not
fear
for
that
and
madame
brother
was
there
and
would
see
all
was
well
then
paul
asked
dmitry
if
his
lady
had
been
aware
that
he
had
been
ill
in
venice
and
he
heard
that
yes
indeed
she
had
kept
herself
informed
of
all
his
movements
and
had
even
sent
vasili
back
on
learning
of
his
danger
and
was
on
the
point
of
throwing
all
prudence
to
the
winds
and
returning
herself
oh
madame
had
greatly
suffered
in
the
past
year
the
old
man
said
but
she
was
more
beautiful
than
ever
and
of
the
gentleness
of
an
angel
taking
continuous
pleasure
in
her
little
son
indeed
anna
had
said
this
was
her
only
joy
to
caress
the
illustrious
infant
and
call
him
paul
such
name
he
had
been
christened
after
a
and
again
dmitry
lowered
his
eyes
and
again
paul
looked
out
of
the
window
and
thrilled
paul
she
had
called
him
paul
their
son
it
touched
him
to
the
heart
oh
the
mad
longing
to
see
her
must
he
wait
a
whole
month
yes
dmitry
said
there
was
no
use
his
coming
before
the
of
may
for
reasons
which
he
could
not
explain
connected
with
the
troublesome
one
every
detail
was
then
arranged
and
dmitry
was
to
send
paul
maps
and
a
chart
and
the
exact
description
and
name
of
the
place
where
the
yacht
was
to
lie
the
whole
thing
would
take
some
time
even
if
they
were
to
depart
the
yacht
is
at
marseilles
now
paul
said
and
we
shall
start
on
the
cruise
next
week
let
me
have
every
last
instruction
at
constantinople
and
for
god
sake
send
me
news
to
naples
on
the
way
dmitry
promised
everything
and
then
as
he
made
his
obeisance
to
go
he
slipped
a
letter
into
paul
hand
madame
had
bidden
him
give
the
excellency
this
when
they
had
talked
and
all
was
settled
he
would
leave
again
that
night
and
his
present
address
would
find
him
till
six
if
the
excellency
had
aught
to
send
in
return
and
then
he
backed
out
with
deep
bows
and
paul
stood
there
clasping
his
letter
a
sudden
spring
of
wild
joy
in
his
heart
and
what
a
letter
it
was
the
very
soul
of
his
loved
one
expressed
in
her
own
quaint
words
first
she
told
him
that
now
she
expected
he
knew
who
she
was
and
as
they
were
to
meet
again
which
in
the
beginning
she
feared
might
never
be
all
reason
for
her
incognito
was
over
then
she
told
him
to
make
sure
he
knew
her
name
and
kingdom
but
sweetheart
she
added
remember
this
my
proudest
titles
ever
are
to
be
thy
loved
one
and
the
mother
of
thy
son
here
paul
kissed
the
words
madly
thrilling
with
pride
and
worship
she
spoke
of
her
still
undying
love
and
of
her
anguishing
sorrow
all
the
winter
at
their
separation
and
at
length
the
joy
of
their
little
one
arrival
thy
image
my
paul
english
and
beautiful
as
i
said
he
would
be
not
black
and
white
like
me
and
oh
beloved
thou
must
always
increase
thy
knowledge
of
statesmancraft
to
help
me
to
train
him
well
then
she
made
a
glorious
picture
of
their
child
future
and
paul
lay
back
in
his
chair
and
closed
his
eyes
the
brightness
of
it
all
dazzled
him
while
his
heart
flew
to
her
in
passionate
adoration
she
went
on
to
speak
of
their
possible
meeting
her
villa
was
but
two
hundred
yards
from
the
sea
only
he
must
follow
exactly
all
dmitry
instructions
or
there
might
be
danger
for
them
both
but
at
all
costs
she
not
much
longer
without
seeing
her
lover
thou
art
more
than
a
lover
my
paul
and
i
am
more
than
ever
thine
thus
it
ended
and
paul
spent
most
of
the
rest
of
his
day
reading
and
it
and
writing
his
worshipping
answer
by
night
both
he
and
dmitry
had
started
on
their
homeward
journeys
chapter
xxviii
the
lady
henrietta
was
desolated
when
paul
and
his
father
announced
their
intention
of
taking
a
month
or
six
weeks
cruise
with
captain
grigsby
so
unnecessary
she
said
at
this
time
of
the
year
almost
the
beginning
of
may
when
england
was
really
getting
most
enjoyable
and
they
were
obliged
to
pacify
her
as
best
they
could
the
mediterranean
such
miles
off
and
so
eccentric
too
starting
when
other
people
would
be
leaving
really
she
had
never
ceased
regretting
ever
having
tolerated
her
son
travels
the
year
before
since
then
there
had
been
no
certainty
in
any
of
his
movements
darling
mother
said
paul
i
must
see
the
world
and
sir
charles
had
snorted
and
chuckled
as
was
his
habit
so
they
sailed
away
from
marseilles
this
party
of
three
like
a
gunboat
under
sealed
orders
a
cruise
to
the
greek
isles
and
beyond
was
what
they
said
attracted
them
especially
the
beyond
captain
grigsby
had
added
with
a
grunt
to
sir
charles
and
if
the
ardour
of
love
and
impatience
boiled
in
paul
veins
the
spirit
of
interested
adventure
animated
his
old
friend
and
his
parent
they
had
not
spoken
much
on
the
subject
to
the
young
man
he
had
briefly
asked
mark
grigsby
to
do
him
this
service
to
take
him
to
a
far
sea
in
the
new
and
there
to
land
him
when
he
should
give
the
word
may
was
a
fair
month
and
an
adventure
is
an
adventure
all
the
world
over
so
mark
grigsby
had
given
a
joyful
assent
then
sir
charles
had
suggested
accompanying
them
and
was
welcomed
by
the
other
two
as
a
third
for
their
party
with
extra
pleasure
i
shall
grow
a
young
man
again
before
i
have
done
grig
he
had
said
happily
but
down
in
his
heart
lurked
some
undefined
fear
for
paul
and
that
was
the
real
reason
for
his
journey
they
had
a
pleasant
voyage
and
picked
up
letters
at
naples
which
only
added
to
paul
impatience
to
be
there
but
they
were
not
to
arrive
before
the
end
of
may
so
the
grecian
archipelago
could
be
investigated
life
in
these
sunny
seas
was
a
joy
to
all
concerned
and
eyes
illuminated
by
his
lady
spirit
saw
beauties
and
felt
shades
and
balances
of
which
his
companions
never
dreamed
so
they
came
at
last
to
the
bosphorus
and
constantinople
here
full
instructions
awaited
them
that
night
paul
took
his
father
and
his
friend
some
way
into
his
confidence
as
he
showed
them
the
chart
and
read
aloud
the
directions
on
the
of
may
should
the
weather
prove
favourable
they
were
to
anchor
towards
night
at
a
certain
spot
latitude
and
longitude
given
and
when
they
heard
a
cry
sharply
three
times
paul
was
to
come
ashore
to
where
he
would
see
a
green
light
vasili
would
be
waiting
for
him
and
from
there
it
was
but
a
few
steps
to
the
garden
gate
of
the
villa
by
the
sea
in
which
his
lady
was
passing
the
summer
it
all
seemed
perfectly
simple
only
the
directions
added
he
must
leave
again
before
dawn
and
the
yacht
be
out
of
sight
before
daylight
as
complications
had
occurred
since
the
letter
to
naples
and
the
one
had
not
left
the
capital
so
things
were
not
so
easy
to
manage
or
safe
paul
impatience
knew
no
bounds
the
concentrated
longing
of
all
these
months
was
animating
him
to
see
his
lady
again
to
clasp
her
to
kiss
her
to
kneel
to
her
and
give
her
homage
and
worship
and
to
behold
his
little
son
always
he
carried
the
minute
flaxen
curl
in
a
locket
and
often
he
had
looked
at
it
and
tried
to
picture
the
wee
head
from
which
it
had
been
cut
but
she
his
love
would
bring
his
son
to
him
and
perhaps
let
him
hold
him
in
his
arms
ah
he
shut
his
eyes
and
imagined
the
tender
scene
would
she
be
changed
should
he
see
the
traces
of
suffering
but
he
would
caress
all
memory
of
pain
away
and
surely
this
meeting
would
only
be
the
forerunner
of
others
to
come
fate
could
never
intend
such
deep
true
love
as
theirs
to
be
apart
an
exaltation
uplifted
him
and
if
his
lady
were
a
queen
and
wore
a
crown
he
felt
himself
the
greatest
king
on
earth
for
was
not
he
the
absolute
ruler
of
her
heart
and
who
could
wish
for
a
more
glorious
kingdom
the
hours
from
constantinople
seemed
longer
than
the
whole
voyage
he
could
hardly
keep
his
attention
to
talk
coherently
about
ordinary
things
at
meals
and
his
father
and
mark
grigsby
left
him
practically
alone
at
last
at
last
the
of
may
dawned
boiling
hot
and
cloudlessly
fair
for
obvious
reasons
they
stayed
beyond
sight
of
the
coast
until
darkness
fell
and
then
came
close
inshore
it
was
a
starlit
night
with
not
a
breath
of
air
and
no
moon
would
illuminate
their
whereabouts
paul
dressed
with
the
greatest
care
never
had
he
been
more
particular
over
his
toilet
tompson
found
him
he
had
broadened
and
filled
out
in
the
past
year
and
his
fair
face
was
tanned
and
blooming
with
health
and
excitement
the
young
devil
a
woman
eye
could
light
on
mark
grigsby
said
as
he
and
sir
charles
watched
him
descend
the
gangway
to
the
boat
when
the
impatiently
awaited
signal
had
been
given
god
keep
him
safe
grig
was
all
sir
charles
could
mutter
with
a
grunt
in
his
throat
the
maddest
excitement
was
racing
through
paul
as
he
held
the
and
made
straight
for
the
light
and
once
he
felt
in
his
pocket
to
assure
himself
he
had
not
forgotten
dmitry
pistol
which
he
had
cleaned
and
loaded
himself
that
afternoon
he
knew
this
adventure
might
be
a
dangerous
one
simple
as
it
looked
superficially
and
now
he
was
an
expert
revolver
shot
thanks
to
constant
practice
the
light
proved
to
be
in
a
little
sheltered
cove
with
a
small
and
yes
the
man
who
held
it
was
the
kalmuck
vasili
welcome
welcome
to
the
he
whispered
as
he
kissed
hand
and
then
in
perfect
silence
they
began
to
ascend
a
path
presently
it
stopped
abruptly
they
had
come
up
perhaps
not
fifty
feet
when
their
way
was
barred
by
a
great
door
hist
said
vasili
softly
and
instantly
it
was
opened
from
within
and
dmitry
peered
anxiously
at
them
ah
the
saints
be
blessed
the
excellency
is
safe
he
said
but
they
must
not
delay
a
minute
he
added
the
excellency
must
return
to
the
waiting
boat
a
slight
but
unexpected
had
befallen
them
connected
with
the
troublesome
one
and
it
would
not
be
safe
for
the
imperial
highness
if
the
excellency
should
land
tonight
she
had
sent
him
to
say
that
the
excellency
was
to
keep
out
at
sea
for
two
days
and
return
steaming
past
and
if
he
saw
a
white
flag
flying
from
the
villa
roof
then
at
night
he
was
to
anchor
and
come
ashore
at
this
same
time
if
not
for
the
moment
he
must
go
on
back
to
constantinople
where
news
and
further
instructions
would
be
sent
him
as
he
spoke
dmitry
indicated
the
return
path
and
bid
the
excellency
follow
him
and
hasten
hasten
this
was
a
terrible
blow
to
paul
but
the
thought
that
he
might
bring
danger
to
his
beloved
one
made
him
not
hesitate
a
moment
they
descended
the
path
in
silence
and
as
he
stepped
into
the
boat
the
old
servant
whispered
the
imperial
highness
had
bid
him
assure
the
excellency
that
all
was
well
the
meeting
was
only
deferred
when
they
should
have
several
days
together
in
safety
the
saints
protect
the
excellency
the
faithful
creature
added
then
when
paul
was
safely
in
the
boat
he
stood
back
to
make
sharply
three
times
the
cry
the
weird
minor
notes
floating
out
on
the
night
seemed
a
wailing
echo
of
the
agonised
disappointment
in
paul
heart
more
than
once
a
mad
impulse
to
go
back
convulsed
his
being
before
he
reached
the
yacht
but
it
was
not
till
afterwards
that
he
remembered
as
a
strange
circumstance
the
fact
that
with
dmitry
first
words
at
the
door
vasili
had
vanished
into
darkness
chapter
xxix
the
two
days
out
at
sea
were
a
raging
impatience
to
paul
in
which
he
learnt
to
understand
all
the
torments
of
tantalus
to
know
and
feel
her
near
and
yet
not
to
be
allowed
to
get
to
her
it
was
an
impossible
cruelty
the
two
men
hearts
ached
for
him
and
captain
grigsby
delivered
himself
of
this
aphorism
say
what
you
will
charles
but
youth
pays
the
devil
of
a
long
price
for
its
pleasures
here
you
and
i
snored
like
a
couple
of
porpoises
all
last
night
while
the
boy
paced
the
deck
and
cursed
everything
and
sir
charles
had
only
grunted
for
he
was
feeling
very
deeply
for
his
son
there
was
a
fresh
breeze
blowing
when
the
time
was
up
and
they
sighted
land
again
and
long
before
any
possible
shore
could
be
examined
paul
stood
his
strongest
glasses
in
his
hand
on
the
at
length
they
came
in
full
view
and
alas
there
could
be
no
mistake
the
flagstaff
upon
the
villa
roof
was
empty
to
the
day
of
his
death
paul
will
keep
a
vivid
picture
of
the
pure
house
no
architecture
met
his
view
but
a
beautiful
marble
structure
in
the
graceful
ionic
style
seeming
a
suitable
habitation
for
his
queen
it
was
approached
by
groves
of
ilex
from
a
wall
at
the
edge
of
the
sea
and
now
paul
could
discern
the
and
the
great
studded
door
a
sensation
of
foreboding
a
wild
mad
anxiety
filled
his
being
what
had
happened
why
might
he
not
land
then
for
the
first
time
that
fact
of
vasili
vanishment
came
into
his
mind
was
there
something
sinister
in
it
had
he
scented
any
danger
to
his
queen
and
gone
to
see
a
whirlwind
of
questions
and
frenzied
speculation
shook
paul
brain
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
now
but
to
cram
on
all
steam
and
make
for
constantinople
he
looked
again
the
green
were
lowered
over
the
windows
all
seemed
peaceful
silent
and
deserted
no
living
being
wandered
in
the
gardens
it
might
have
been
a
mausoleum
for
the
dead
and
as
this
thought
came
to
him
paul
almost
cried
aloud
then
he
dominated
himself
how
weak
and
intolerably
foolish
to
imagine
evil
where
perhaps
none
was
why
should
his
thoughts
fly
to
terrible
reasons
for
the
postponement
of
his
joy
when
in
truth
they
could
as
well
be
of
the
simplest
a
sudden
call
to
the
city
a
descent
of
some
undesirable
spying
eye
a
hundred
and
one
possible
things
all
much
more
likely
than
any
ones
of
fear
he
would
not
permit
another
moment
of
wonder
he
would
regain
his
calm
and
wait
like
a
man
for
certainty
thus
his
face
wore
an
iron
mask
and
his
thoughts
an
iron
band
and
presently
they
came
to
constantinople
but
of
what
followed
afterwards
it
is
difficult
to
write
for
fate
struck
paul
on
that
warm
june
morning
and
blasted
his
life
so
that
for
many
days
he
only
saw
red
and
lived
in
hell
every
one
knows
the
story
which
at
the
time
convulsed
europe
how
a
certain
king
after
a
wild
orgie
of
mad
drunkenness
rode
out
with
two
boon
companions
to
the
villa
of
his
queen
and
there
forcing
an
entrance
ran
a
dagger
through
her
heart
before
her
faithful
servants
could
protect
her
and
most
people
were
glad
too
that
this
brute
paid
the
penalty
of
his
crime
by
his
own
death
his
worthless
life
choked
out
of
him
by
the
queen
devoted
kalmuck
groom
but
only
paul
and
his
father
and
mark
grigsby
know
the
details
which
were
told
in
dmitry
letter
how
that
night
the
of
may
at
the
hour
the
excellency
was
expected
he
dmitry
was
waiting
in
the
garden
to
meet
him
and
conduct
him
through
the
gloom
when
while
he
stood
there
under
the
stars
the
imperial
highness
had
called
him
softly
telling
him
to
take
the
message
down
to
the
excellency
which
he
did
how
he
had
never
dreamed
that
immediate
danger
threatened
her
or
that
the
king
was
there
or
he
would
not
have
left
her
for
any
peril
to
the
excellency
who
was
after
all
a
man
and
could
fight
and
how
vasili
being
younger
and
more
quick
of
wit
had
suspected
hearing
his
message
as
he
gave
it
to
the
excellency
that
all
was
not
well
and
had
hastened
to
the
house
too
late
to
save
his
queen
and
then
the
faithful
servant
took
up
anna
tale
how
this
good
girl
had
been
watching
on
the
side
of
the
villa
towards
the
town
and
had
heard
the
king
come
battering
at
the
gate
how
she
had
flown
to
warn
her
mistress
but
that
the
had
sent
her
back
to
watch
saying
she
herself
would
call
dmitry
to
protect
them
of
course
as
they
now
guessed
on
purpose
that
anna
should
not
hear
her
message
to
him
as
the
queen
knew
full
well
if
he
dmitry
heard
from
anna
the
king
was
there
and
she
the
queen
in
danger
he
would
not
leave
her
even
to
do
her
bidding
then
of
how
the
king
had
thrust
the
frightened
servants
aside
and
strode
with
threats
and
oaths
into
the
hall
accompanied
by
his
two
vile
men
and
how
anna
had
implored
the
queen
to
hide
while
there
was
yet
time
but
how
that
shining
one
had
stood
only
listening
intently
for
the
cry
and
then
when
she
heard
it
had
turned
in
triumph
to
the
entering
king
saying
to
anna
that
nothing
mattered
now
the
excellency
was
safe
on
her
face
as
she
looked
at
this
monster
was
no
dread
of
death
or
aught
but
scorn
and
fearless
pride
how
anna
seeing
the
dagger
had
screamed
and
tried
to
get
between
but
had
been
seized
by
one
of
the
execrated
men
and
there
been
forced
to
watch
the
murder
of
her
worshipped
queen
ah
that
had
been
a
moment
the
saints
could
never
efface
the
splendid
lady
had
stood
quite
still
her
head
thrown
back
while
this
hound
of
hell
had
lurched
towards
her
hissing
through
his
evil
teeth
this
dreadful
sentence
since
thou
hast
at
last
obeyed
me
and
found
me
an
heir
making
the
people
love
me
i
have
no
more
use
for
thee
it
will
be
a
joy
to
kill
thee
and
with
that
he
had
plunged
the
dagger
in
her
heart
of
all
that
followed
the
excellency
would
know
how
vasili
had
entered
scattering
the
minions
like
a
mad
bull
and
springing
upon
the
villainous
king
had
torn
his
life
out
on
the
marble
floor
thus
ended
the
letter
ah
god
for
paul
had
come
the
tears
but
for
her
cold
steel
and
blood
and
so
as
ever
the
woman
paid
the
price
chapter
xxx
now
some
of
you
who
read
will
think
her
death
was
just
because
she
was
not
a
moral
woman
but
others
will
hold
with
paul
she
was
the
noblest
lady
who
ever
wore
a
crown
and
in
all
cases
she
is
beyond
our
puny
reasonings
but
her
work
in
paul
heart
still
lives
and
will
live
to
the
end
of
his
life
although
for
long
months
after
the
agony
of
that
june
day
nothing
but
hate
and
passion
and
misery
had
the
ruling
of
him
he
could
not
bear
his
kind
his
father
and
captain
grigsby
had
left
the
yacht
to
him
and
let
him
cruise
alone
but
who
can
know
of
the
hideous
ghastly
hours
that
paul
spent
then
ever
obsessed
with
this
one
bitter
thought
why
had
he
not
gone
back
why
had
he
not
gone
back
when
that
impulse
had
seized
him
why
had
vasili
and
not
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
killing
this
vile
slayer
of
his
queen
even
the
remembrance
of
his
child
did
not
rouse
him
it
was
safe
with
the
grand
duke
peter
a
king
at
four
months
old
but
what
of
sons
or
kings
or
countries
nothing
could
make
up
for
the
loss
of
his
queen
and
to
think
that
she
had
died
to
save
him
save
him
from
what
a
brush
with
three
besotted
drunkards
whom
it
would
have
been
great
joy
to
kill
there
were
moments
when
paul
went
mad
with
passion
and
lay
and
writhed
in
his
berth
so
long
months
passed
and
at
last
he
dominated
himself
enough
to
come
back
to
his
home
and
if
the
lady
henrietta
had
exclaimed
that
he
appeared
ill
before
on
his
return
she
was
dumb
now
with
sorrow
at
the
change
for
paul
had
looked
upon
medusa
head
of
horror
and
as
well
as
his
heart
his
face
seemed
turned
to
stone
he
was
gentle
with
his
mother
and
let
her
caress
him
as
much
as
she
would
but
nothing
any
one
could
say
could
move
him
even
pike
joyous
greeting
the
whole
of
god
world
was
his
enemy
for
was
he
not
alone
there
robbed
of
his
mate
presently
the
reaction
from
this
violence
came
and
an
intense
apathy
set
in
a
saltless
tasteless
existence
what
was
parliament
to
him
what
was
his
country
or
his
nation
or
even
his
home
only
the
hunting
when
it
came
gave
him
some
relief
and
then
if
the
run
were
fast
enough
or
the
jumps
prodigiously
high
or
his
horses
sufficiently
fresh
to
be
difficult
his
blood
ran
again
for
a
brief
space
but
beyond
this
life
was
hell
and
often
he
was
tempted
to
use
that
little
pistol
of
dmitry
and
end
it
and
sleep
only
the
inherent
manly
english
spirit
in
him
deep
down
somewhere
prevented
him
all
this
time
his
father
grieved
and
grieved
and
the
lady
henrietta
spent
hours
in
tears
and
prayer
sir
charles
had
told
her
their
son
had
met
with
a
great
sorrow
and
they
must
bow
their
heads
and
leave
him
in
peace
so
there
were
no
more
gay
young
parties
at
verdayne
place
and
gone
for
ever
were
the
visions
of
the
grandchildren
only
mark
grigsby
was
a
constant
visitor
but
then
he
knew
thus
a
year
passed
away
and
paul
left
on
a
voyage
round
the
world
an
englishman
stern
duty
to
be
a
man
at
all
costs
was
calling
him
at
last
bidding
him
in
change
of
scene
to
try
and
overcome
the
paralysing
dominion
of
his
grief
but
as
far
as
that
went
the
experiment
proved
futile
if
moments
came
when
circumstances
did
divert
him
such
as
one
or
two
great
storms
he
happened
to
come
across
and
one
or
two
exciting
situations
still
when
things
were
fair
and
peaceful
back
would
rush
the
ache
that
passionate
void
and
loss
for
which
there
seems
no
remedy
gentle
pleasant
women
longed
to
lavish
worship
upon
him
and
paul
talked
and
was
polite
but
all
their
sweetness
touched
him
no
more
than
summer
ripples
stir
the
bottom
of
a
lake
he
seemed
impervious
to
any
human
influence
though
when
the
look
of
a
mountain
or
the
colour
of
would
remind
him
of
the
bürgenstock
anguish
as
fresh
as
ever
stabbed
his
heart
yet
all
this
while
unknown
to
himself
his
faculties
were
developing
he
read
deeply
he
had
unconsciously
grown
to
apply
his
darling
lucid
reasoning
to
every
detail
of
his
judgment
of
life
it
was
as
if
it
had
before
been
written
in
cypher
for
him
and
she
had
now
given
him
the
key
his
mind
was
untiring
in
its
efforts
to
master
subjects
as
his
splendid
physique
seemed
tireless
in
all
manner
of
sport
thus
he
saw
the
world
and
its
peoples
and
was
an
honoured
guest
among
the
great
ones
of
the
earth
but
the
hardness
of
adamant
was
in
him
he
had
no
beliefs
no
ambitions
he
dissected
everything
with
all
the
pitiless
certainty
of
a
surgeon
cold
knife
and
if
his
life
contained
an
aim
at
all
it
was
to
get
through
with
it
and
find
oblivion
in
eternal
sleep
thoughts
of
his
little
son
would
sometimes
come
to
him
but
when
they
did
he
thrust
them
back
and
shut
his
heart
up
in
a
casing
of
ice
to
feel
was
to
suffer
that
perhaps
was
his
only
creed
that
and
a
blind
sullen
rage
against
fate
this
was
the
lesson
his
suffering
had
taught
him
and
they
were
weary
years
before
he
knew
another
side
the
first
time
he
saw
a
tiger
in
india
was
one
of
the
landmarks
in
the
history
of
his
inner
emotions
he
had
gone
to
shoot
the
beasts
with
a
rajah
and
it
had
chanced
he
came
upon
a
magnificent
creature
at
very
close
quarters
and
had
shot
it
on
sight
but
when
it
lay
dead
its
wonderful
body
gracefully
moving
no
more
a
sickening
regret
came
over
paul
of
all
things
in
creation
none
reminded
him
so
forcibly
of
his
lost
worshipped
queen
in
a
flash
came
back
to
him
the
first
day
she
had
lain
on
the
skin
which
had
been
his
gift
out
of
the
jungle
her
eyes
seemed
to
gleam
in
his
ears
rang
her
words
i
know
all
your
feelings
and
your
passions
and
now
i
have
your
skin
for
the
joy
of
my
skin
yes
she
had
loved
tigers
and
been
in
sympathy
with
them
always
and
here
was
one
whose
joy
of
life
he
had
ended
no
he
could
never
kill
one
more
after
this
expedition
for
weeks
he
was
restless
the
incident
seemed
to
have
pierced
through
his
carefully
cultivated
calm
for
days
and
days
fresh
as
in
the
first
hours
of
his
grief
came
an
infinite
sensation
of
pain
just
hideous
personal
pain
so
time
and
his
journeys
went
on
but
no
country
and
no
change
of
scene
could
dull
paul
sense
of
loss
and
the
great
vast
terrible
finality
of
all
hope
the
hackneyed
phrase
would
continually
ring
in
his
brain
of
never
again
never
again
ah
god
it
was
true
he
would
hold
his
beloved
one
never
again
and
often
unavailing
rebellion
against
destiny
would
rise
up
in
him
and
he
would
almost
go
mad
and
see
red
once
more
then
he
would
rush
away
from
civilisation
out
into
the
wild
but
these
violent
emotions
were
always
followed
by
a
heavy
numb
lethargy
until
some
echo
or
resemblance
roused
him
to
suffering
again
the
scent
of
tuberoses
caused
him
anguish
unspeakable
one
night
in
new
york
he
was
obliged
to
leave
the
opera
because
a
woman
he
was
with
wore
some
in
her
dress
thus
with
all
his
strong
will
there
were
times
when
he
could
not
control
himself
or
his
grief
he
had
been
absent
from
england
for
over
two
years
when
the
news
came
to
him
far
out
in
america
of
his
uncle
hubert
death
so
he
had
gone
to
join
the
world
of
spirits
in
the
vast
beyond
paul
did
not
care
his
only
feeling
was
one
of
relief
no
more
fear
of
hearing
perhaps
some
chance
idle
word
but
he
remembered
his
mother
had
loved
her
handsome
brother
and
he
wrote
a
tender
letter
home
then
something
in
the
lady
henrietta
answer
touched
him
vaguely
and
decided
him
to
return
after
all
because
life
was
a
black
barren
waste
to
him
what
right
had
he
to
dim
all
joy
in
the
two
who
had
given
him
being
yes
he
would
go
back
and
try
to
pick
up
the
threads
anew
there
were
great
quiet
rejoicings
in
his
parents
hearts
at
their
third
homecoming
and
like
a
wild
beast
tamed
for
a
time
to
perform
tricks
in
a
circus
paul
conformed
to
the
ordinary
routine
the
question
of
his
entering
parliament
was
mooted
again
but
this
he
put
aside
as
yet
he
could
face
no
ties
he
would
do
his
best
by
staying
at
home
most
of
the
year
but
when
that
call
of
anguish
was
upon
him
he
must
be
free
once
more
to
roam
then
hope
began
to
bloom
in
the
lady
henrietta
heart
as
flowers
after
rain
surely
this
great
unknown
grief
was
passing
surely
her
adored
one
would
settle
down
again
chapter
xxxi
but
the
months
went
by
without
healing
paul
grief
time
only
coated
it
with
a
dull
callous
crust
he
had
got
into
a
hard
way
of
taking
everything
as
it
came
he
did
not
fly
from
society
or
ape
the
manners
of
the
misanthrope
he
went
to
london
and
stayed
about
and
played
the
game
but
all
with
a
stony
bald
indifference
which
made
people
wonder
no
faintest
inkling
of
his
story
had
ever
leaked
out
and
it
seemed
an
incomprehensible
attitude
towards
life
for
a
young
and
fortunate
man
those
who
had
looked
for
great
things
from
his
birthday
speech
shook
their
heads
sadly
at
the
unfulfilment
so
time
passed
on
until
one
day
at
the
beginning
of
february
nearly
five
years
after
the
light
had
gone
out
of
his
life
a
circumstance
happened
which
proved
a
of
great
magnitude
it
was
quite
a
small
thing
just
the
brutalised
hardness
in
a
gipsy
face
the
sun
was
setting
that
late
afternoon
when
he
strode
home
across
the
moor
with
pike
and
they
came
upon
some
gipsy
vans
paul
looked
up
it
was
no
unaccustomed
sight
only
they
happened
to
be
in
exactly
the
same
spot
where
the
like
had
stood
that
morning
long
ago
when
in
his
exuberant
happiness
at
the
news
of
his
little
son
birth
he
had
tossed
the
young
woman
the
sovereign
the
door
of
the
last
van
was
open
and
there
sitting
on
the
steps
in
an
attitude
of
dull
sullen
idleness
was
the
same
swarthy
lass
only
now
she
was
altered
sadly
no
more
the
proud
young
mother
met
his
view
but
a
hard
gaunt
woman
she
knew
him
instantly
and
her
black
eyes
fiercened
as
he
came
up
close
to
her
she
said
without
any
greeting
i
lost
him
your
honour
him
and
my
bill
in
the
same
blasted
year
and
i
ai
never
had
no
other
paul
stopped
and
peered
into
her
brown
face
in
the
fading
light
so
we
have
been
both
through
hell
since
then
my
poor
girl
he
said
the
gipsy
woman
laughed
with
bitter
harshness
as
she
echoed
back
the
one
word
hell
and
afterwards
she
added
with
a
wail
yes
they
dead
and
there
wo
be
never
no
meeting
and
paul
went
on
but
her
face
haunted
him
was
there
the
same
hard
change
in
himself
he
wondered
was
he
too
brutalised
and
branded
with
the
five
years
of
hell
surely
if
so
he
had
gone
on
a
lower
road
than
his
darling
would
have
had
him
travel
then
out
of
the
mist
of
the
dying
day
came
the
memory
of
her
noble
face
as
it
had
been
in
that
happy
hour
when
they
had
floated
out
to
the
lagoon
and
she
had
told
him
her
eyes
alight
with
the
her
wishes
for
his
future
but
what
had
he
done
to
carry
them
out
those
lofty
wishes
surely
nothing
for
obsessed
with
his
own
selfish
anguish
he
had
lived
on
with
no
single
worthy
aim
with
no
aim
at
all
except
to
forget
and
deaden
his
suffering
forget
ah
god
that
could
never
be
for
had
she
not
said
there
was
an
eternal
marriage
of
their
souls
in
life
or
in
death
they
could
never
be
parted
and
he
had
tried
to
break
this
sacred
tender
bond
when
he
should
have
cherished
every
memory
to
comfort
his
deep
pain
with
its
sweetness
what
had
he
done
let
sorrow
sink
him
to
the
level
of
the
poor
gipsy
girl
instead
of
trying
to
do
some
fine
thing
as
a
tribute
to
his
lady
noble
teaching
he
strode
on
in
the
dusk
towards
his
home
his
thoughts
lashing
him
with
shame
and
remorse
and
that
night
when
he
and
pike
were
alone
in
his
own
panelled
room
he
broke
the
seal
of
those
beautiful
letters
which
with
directions
for
them
to
be
buried
with
his
body
at
his
death
had
lain
in
a
packet
hidden
away
from
sight
all
these
years
freighted
with
agonised
memory
he
read
them
over
carefully
from
the
first
brief
note
to
the
last
long
cry
of
love
which
dmitry
had
brought
him
to
paris
then
he
lay
back
in
his
chair
while
his
strong
frame
shook
with
sobs
and
his
eyes
were
blinded
by
scorching
bitter
tears
but
suddenly
it
seemed
as
if
his
lady
spirit
stood
beside
him
in
the
firelight
flickering
gleam
whispering
words
of
hope
pleading
to
come
back
from
the
cold
grave
to
his
heart
there
to
abide
and
comfort
him
he
heard
her
golden
voice
once
more
and
it
fell
like
soft
healing
rain
so
that
he
stretched
out
his
arms
and
cried
aloud
my
darling
beloved
one
forgive
me
for
these
five
wasted
years
sweetheart
come
back
to
me
never
to
part
again
come
back
to
my
heart
and
dwell
there
angel
queen
then
as
the
days
went
on
all
the
world
altered
for
him
instead
of
the
terrible
bitterness
against
fate
which
had
ruled
his
heart
a
new
tenderness
grew
there
it
seemed
now
as
though
he
were
never
alone
but
lived
in
her
memory
and
with
this
golden
change
came
thoughts
of
his
child
that
little
life
neglected
for
so
long
what
had
he
done
what
cruel
terrible
thing
had
he
done
in
his
selfish
pain
each
year
dmitry
had
sent
him
a
letter
of
news
and
each
year
that
day
had
held
ghastly
hours
for
him
in
the
reopening
of
old
anguish
the
missive
to
be
read
and
quickly
thrust
out
of
sight
the
thought
of
it
to
be
strangled
and
forgotten
and
now
the
little
one
would
soon
be
five
years
old
and
his
living
eyes
had
never
seen
him
but
this
should
no
more
be
so
and
he
wrote
at
once
to
dmitry
by
return
of
post
came
the
answer
the
excellency
indeed
would
be
welcome
the
regent
the
grand
duke
peter
had
bidden
him
say
that
if
the
excellency
should
be
travelling
for
pleasure
as
the
nobility
of
his
country
often
did
he
would
gladly
be
received
by
the
regent
who
was
himself
a
great
and
the
excellency
would
then
see
the
baby
king
of
this
glorious
child
he
dmitry
found
it
difficult
to
write
it
was
as
if
the
breathed
again
in
his
spirit
while
he
was
the
portrait
of
his
illustrious
father
proving
how
deeply
and
well
the
must
have
loved
that
father
if
the
excellency
could
arrive
in
time
for
the
majesty
fifth
birthday
on
the
of
february
there
was
to
be
a
special
ceremony
in
the
great
church
which
the
regent
thought
might
be
of
interest
to
the
excellency
paul
wired
back
he
would
travel
night
and
day
to
be
in
time
and
he
instructed
dmitry
to
have
the
necessary
arrangements
made
that
he
might
go
straight
to
the
church
in
case
unforeseen
delay
should
not
permit
him
to
arrive
until
that
morning
it
was
in
a
shaft
of
sunlight
from
the
great
altar
window
that
paul
first
saw
his
son
the
tiny
upright
figure
in
its
blue
velvet
suit
heavily
trimmed
with
sable
standing
there
proudly
a
fair
english
child
the
living
reality
of
that
miniature
painted
on
ivory
and
framed
in
fine
pearls
which
made
the
holy
of
holies
on
lady
henrietta
and
as
he
gazed
at
his
little
son
while
the
organ
pealed
out
a
te
deum
and
the
sweet
choir
sang
a
great
rush
of
tenderness
filled
paul
heart
and
melted
forever
the
icebergs
of
grief
and
pain
and
as
he
knelt
there
watching
their
child
it
seemed
as
if
his
darling
stood
beside
him
telling
him
that
he
must
look
up
and
thank
god
too
for
in
her
spirit
constant
love
and
this
glory
of
their
son
he
would
one
day
find
rest
and
consolation
the
end
