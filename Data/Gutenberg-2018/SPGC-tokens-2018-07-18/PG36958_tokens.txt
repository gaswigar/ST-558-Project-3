preface
to
the
third
edition
i
am
glad
to
take
this
the
first
available
opportunity
to
acknowledge
the
kindness
with
which
child
of
the
has
been
received
both
by
the
reading
public
from
which
i
have
received
many
gratifying
assurances
that
what
i
have
tried
to
say
has
not
altogether
failed
of
its
effect
and
by
the
reviewers
the
most
of
whom
have
written
in
very
indulgent
terms
i
think
indeed
that
i
am
the
more
gratified
by
the
fact
that
this
reception
has
not
been
unanimous
because
an
outcry
and
an
opposition
even
from
an
unimportant
minority
are
proofs
that
i
have
succeeded
in
saying
however
imperfectly
something
that
was
worth
being
said
under
the
conditions
of
life
as
we
know
it
there
is
no
truth
worth
telling
that
will
not
interfere
with
some
hearer
comfort
various
objections
have
been
made
to
child
of
the
and
many
of
them
had
already
been
made
to
of
mean
and
it
has
been
the
way
of
the
objectors
as
well
as
the
way
of
many
among
the
kindest
of
my
critics
to
call
me
a
the
word
has
been
used
sometimes
it
would
seem
in
praise
sometimes
in
mere
indifference
as
one
uses
a
phrase
of
convenient
description
sometimes
by
way
of
an
irremediable
reproach
it
is
natural
then
not
merely
that
i
should
wish
to
examine
certain
among
the
objections
made
to
my
work
but
that
i
should
feel
some
interest
in
the
definition
and
description
of
a
realist
a
matter
never
made
clear
to
me
now
it
is
a
fact
that
i
have
never
called
myself
a
and
i
have
never
put
forth
any
work
as
i
decline
the
labels
of
the
schoolmen
and
the
sophisters
being
a
simple
writer
of
tales
who
takes
whatever
means
lie
to
his
hand
to
present
life
as
he
sees
it
who
insists
on
no
process
and
who
refuses
to
be
bound
by
any
formula
or
prescription
prepared
by
the
cataloguers
and
the
of
literature
so
it
happens
that
when
those
who
use
the
word
use
it
with
no
unanimity
of
intent
and
with
a
loose
inapprehensive
application
it
is
not
easy
for
me
who
repudiate
it
altogether
to
make
a
guess
at
its
meaning
nevertheless
it
seems
to
me
that
the
man
who
is
called
a
is
one
who
seeing
things
with
his
own
eyes
discards
the
conventions
of
the
schools
and
presents
his
matter
in
individual
terms
of
art
for
awhile
the
schoolmen
abuse
him
as
a
realist
and
in
twenty
years
time
if
his
work
have
life
in
it
he
becomes
a
classic
constable
was
called
a
realist
so
was
corot
who
calls
these
painters
realists
now
the
history
of
japanese
art
affords
a
continuous
illustration
from
the
day
when
iwasa
matahei
impudently
arose
and
dared
to
take
his
subjects
from
the
daily
life
of
the
people
to
the
day
when
hiroshigé
casting
away
the
last
rag
of
propriety
adventurously
drew
a
cast
shadow
in
flat
defiance
of
all
the
canons
of
tosa
and
kano
in
all
this
time
and
through
all
the
crowded
history
of
the
school
of
ukioyé
no
artist
bringing
something
of
his
own
to
his
art
but
was
damned
for
a
realist
even
the
classic
harunobu
did
not
escape
look
now
at
the
work
of
these
men
and
the
label
seems
grotesque
enough
so
it
goes
through
the
making
of
all
art
a
man
with
the
courage
of
his
own
vision
interprets
what
he
sees
in
fresh
terms
and
gives
to
things
a
new
reality
and
an
immediate
presence
the
schoolmen
peer
with
dulled
eyes
from
amid
the
heap
of
precedents
and
prescriptions
about
them
and
distracted
by
seeing
a
thing
sanctioned
neither
by
precedent
nor
by
prescription
dub
the
man
realist
and
rail
against
him
for
that
his
work
fits
none
of
their
and
from
without
the
schools
many
cry
out
and
complain
for
truth
is
strong
meat
and
the
weakling
stomach
turns
against
it
except
in
minim
doses
smothered
in
treacle
thus
we
hear
the
feeble
plea
that
the
function
of
imagination
is
the
distortion
of
fact
the
piteous
demand
that
the
artist
should
be
shut
up
in
a
and
forbidden
to
peep
through
the
hedge
into
the
world
and
they
who
know
nothing
of
beauty
who
are
innately
incapable
of
comprehending
it
mistake
it
for
mere
prettiness
and
call
aloud
for
comfits
and
among
them
that
can
not
understand
such
definitions
of
the
aims
of
art
are
bandied
as
mean
if
they
mean
anything
that
art
finds
its
most
perfect
expression
in
pink
lollipops
and
gilt
boxes
but
in
the
end
the
truth
prevails
if
it
be
well
set
forth
and
the
schoolmen
groaning
in
their
infinite
labour
wearily
write
another
prescription
admit
another
precedent
and
make
another
i
have
been
asked
in
print
if
i
think
that
there
is
no
phase
of
life
which
the
artist
may
not
touch
most
certainly
i
think
this
more
i
know
it
it
is
the
artist
privilege
to
seek
his
material
where
he
pleases
and
it
is
no
man
privilege
to
say
him
nay
if
the
community
have
left
horrible
places
and
horrible
lives
before
his
eyes
then
the
fault
is
the
community
and
to
picture
these
places
and
these
lives
becomes
not
merely
his
privilege
but
his
duty
it
was
my
fate
to
encounter
a
place
in
shoreditch
where
children
were
born
and
reared
in
circumstances
which
gave
them
no
reasonable
chance
of
living
decent
lives
where
they
were
born
to
a
criminal
or
career
it
was
my
experience
to
learn
the
ways
of
this
place
to
know
its
inhabitants
to
talk
with
them
eat
drink
and
work
with
them
for
the
existence
of
this
place
and
for
the
evils
it
engendered
the
community
was
and
is
responsible
so
that
every
member
of
the
community
was
and
is
responsible
in
his
degree
if
i
had
been
a
rich
man
i
might
have
attempted
to
discharge
my
peculiar
responsibility
in
one
way
if
i
had
been
a
statesman
i
might
have
tried
another
being
neither
of
these
things
but
a
mere
writer
of
fiction
i
sought
to
do
my
duty
by
writing
a
tale
wherein
i
hoped
to
bring
the
conditions
of
this
place
within
the
apprehension
of
others
there
are
those
who
say
that
i
should
have
turned
away
my
eyes
and
passed
by
on
the
other
side
on
the
very
respectable
precedent
of
the
priest
and
the
levite
in
the
parable
now
when
the
tale
was
written
and
published
it
was
found
as
i
have
said
to
cause
discomfort
to
some
persons
it
is
needless
to
say
more
of
the
schoolmen
needless
too
to
say
much
of
the
merely
genteel
who
were
shocked
to
read
of
low
creatures
as
kiddo
cook
and
pigeony
poll
and
to
find
my
pages
nowhere
illuminated
by
a
marquis
of
such
are
they
who
delight
to
read
of
two
men
in
velvet
and
feathers
perforating
each
other
stomachs
with
swords
while
josh
perrott
and
billy
leary
punching
each
other
heads
present
a
scene
too
sickening
and
brutal
to
consider
without
disgust
and
it
was
in
defiance
of
the
maunderings
of
such
as
these
that
charles
lamb
wrote
much
of
his
essay
the
genius
and
character
of
but
chiefly
this
book
of
mine
disturbed
those
who
had
done
nothing
and
preferred
to
do
nothing
by
way
of
discharging
their
responsibility
toward
the
jago
and
the
people
in
it
the
consciousness
of
duty
neglected
is
discomforting
and
personal
comfort
is
the
god
of
their
kind
they
firmly
believe
it
to
be
the
sole
function
of
art
to
minister
to
their
personal
comfort
as
upholstery
does
they
find
it
comfortable
to
shirk
consideration
of
the
fate
of
the
jago
children
to
shut
their
eyes
to
it
to
say
that
all
is
well
and
the
whole
world
virtuous
and
happy
and
this
mental
attitude
they
nickname
optimism
and
vaunt
it
exult
in
it
as
a
quality
so
that
they
cry
out
at
the
suggestion
that
it
is
no
more
than
a
selfish
vice
and
finding
truth
where
they
had
looked
for
the
materials
of
another
debauch
of
they
moan
aloud
they
protest
and
they
demand
as
their
sacred
right
that
the
bitter
cup
be
taken
from
before
them
they
have
moaned
and
protested
at
child
of
the
and
craven
and
bewildered
any
protest
seemed
good
enough
to
them
and
herein
they
have
not
wanted
for
allies
among
them
that
sit
in
and
tinker
for
your
professed
philanthropist
following
his
own
spirit
and
seeing
nothing
honestly
resents
the
demonstration
that
his
tinkering
profits
little
there
is
a
story
current
in
the
east
end
of
london
of
a
distracted
lady
who
being
assailed
with
a
request
for
the
loan
of
a
saucepan
defended
herself
in
these
words
yer
mother
i
lend
the
saucepan
consekince
o
lent
it
to
mrs
brown
besides
which
i
of
it
meself
an
moreover
it
gone
to
be
mended
an
what
more
i
ai
got
one
in
a
like
spirit
of
lavish
objection
it
has
been
proclaimed
in
a
breath
that
i
transgress
because
i
should
not
have
written
of
the
jago
in
all
the
nakedness
of
truth
my
description
is
not
in
the
least
like
moreover
it
is
exaggerated
though
it
may
be
true
it
is
quite
unnecessary
because
the
jago
was
already
quite
familiar
and
everybody
knew
all
about
it
the
jago
houses
have
been
pulled
down
and
there
never
was
any
such
place
as
the
jago
at
all
to
objections
thus
handsomely
variegated
it
is
not
easy
to
reply
with
the
tripping
brevity
wherewith
they
may
be
stated
and
truly
it
is
little
reply
that
they
call
for
except
perhaps
in
so
far
as
they
may
be
taken
to
impugn
the
sincerity
of
my
work
and
the
accuracy
of
my
picture
a
few
of
the
objectors
have
caught
up
enough
of
their
wits
to
strive
after
a
war
in
my
own
country
they
take
hold
of
my
technical
method
and
accuse
me
of
lack
of
they
claim
that
if
i
write
of
the
jago
i
should
do
so
weeping
now
my
technical
method
is
my
own
and
is
deliberately
designed
to
achieve
a
certain
result
as
is
the
method
of
every
man
painter
poet
sculptor
or
novelist
who
is
not
the
slave
and
the
plaything
of
his
material
my
tale
is
the
tale
of
my
characters
and
i
have
learned
better
than
to
thrust
myself
and
my
emotions
between
them
and
my
reader
the
cant
of
the
charge
stares
all
too
plainly
from
the
face
of
it
it
is
not
that
these
good
people
wish
me
to
write
weeping
for
how
do
they
know
whether
i
weep
or
not
no
their
wish
is
not
that
i
shall
weep
but
that
i
shall
weep
obscenely
in
the
public
gaze
in
other
words
that
i
shall
do
their
weeping
for
them
as
a
sort
of
emotional
bedesman
that
i
shall
make
public
parade
of
sympathy
in
their
behalf
so
that
they
may
keep
their
own
sympathy
for
themselves
and
win
comfort
from
the
belief
that
they
are
eased
of
their
just
responsibility
by
vicarious
snivelling
but
the
protest
that
my
picture
of
the
jago
is
untrue
is
another
thing
for
the
most
part
it
has
found
very
vague
expression
but
there
are
instances
of
rash
excursion
into
definiteness
certain
passages
have
been
denoted
as
exaggerations
as
impossibilities
now
i
must
confess
that
foreseeing
such
adventurous
indiscretions
i
had
for
my
own
diversion
set
child
of
the
with
traps
for
certain
years
i
have
lived
in
the
east
end
of
london
and
have
been
not
an
occasional
visitor
but
a
familiar
and
equal
friend
in
the
house
of
the
in
all
his
degrees
for
though
the
steps
between
be
smaller
there
are
more
social
degrees
in
the
east
end
than
ever
in
the
west
in
this
experience
i
have
seen
and
i
have
heard
things
that
persons
sitting
in
would
call
diabolical
fable
nevertheless
i
have
seen
them
and
heard
them
but
it
was
none
of
my
design
to
write
of
extreme
instances
typical
facts
were
all
i
wanted
these
i
knew
would
be
met
or
shirked
with
incredulity
so
that
whenever
i
saw
reason
to
anticipate
a
charge
of
exaggeration
as
for
instance
in
the
matter
of
faction
fighting
i
made
my
typical
incident
the
cold
transcript
of
a
simple
fact
an
ordinary
fact
a
fact
notorious
in
the
neighbourhood
and
capable
of
any
amount
of
reasonable
proof
if
i
touched
my
fact
at
all
it
was
to
subdue
it
that
and
no
more
the
traps
worked
well
not
one
definite
charge
of
exaggeration
has
been
flung
but
it
has
been
aimed
at
one
of
the
normal
facts
i
had
provided
as
a
target
not
one
sometimes
the
effect
has
had
a
humour
of
its
own
as
when
a
critic
in
a
literary
journal
beginning
by
selecting
two
of
my
norms
as
instances
of
exaggeration
went
on
to
assure
me
that
there
was
no
need
to
describe
such
life
as
the
life
in
the
jago
because
it
was
already
perfectly
familiar
to
everybody
luckily
i
need
not
vindicate
my
accuracy
that
has
been
done
for
me
publicly
by
independent
and
altogether
indisputable
authority
in
particular
the
devoted
vicar
of
the
parish
which
i
have
called
the
jago
has
testified
quite
unreservedly
to
the
truth
of
my
presentation
others
also
with
special
knowledge
have
done
the
same
and
though
i
refer
to
them
and
am
grateful
for
their
support
it
is
with
no
prejudice
to
the
validity
of
my
own
authority
for
not
only
have
i
lived
in
the
east
end
of
london
which
one
may
do
and
yet
never
see
it
but
observation
is
my
trade
i
have
remarked
in
more
than
one
place
the
expression
of
a
foolish
fancy
that
because
the
houses
of
the
old
jago
have
been
pulled
down
the
jago
difficulty
has
been
cleared
out
of
the
way
that
is
far
from
being
the
case
the
jago
as
mere
bricks
and
mortar
is
gone
but
the
jago
in
flesh
and
blood
still
lives
and
is
crowding
into
neighbourhoods
already
densely
in
conclusion
the
plan
and
the
intention
of
my
story
made
it
requisite
that
in
telling
it
i
should
largely
adhere
to
fact
and
i
did
so
if
i
write
other
tales
different
in
scope
and
design
i
shall
adhere
to
fact
or
neglect
it
as
may
seem
good
to
me
regardless
of
classification
as
a
realist
or
as
anything
else
for
though
i
have
made
a
suggestion
right
or
wrong
as
to
what
a
realist
may
be
whether
i
am
one
or
not
is
no
concern
of
mine
but
the
concern
if
it
be
anybody
of
the
tabulators
and
the
watersifters
illustration
the
old
jago
sketch
plan
a
child
of
the
jago
i
it
was
past
the
mid
of
a
summer
night
in
the
old
jago
the
narrow
street
was
all
the
blacker
for
the
lurid
sky
for
there
was
a
fire
in
a
farther
part
of
shoreditch
and
the
welkin
was
an
infernal
coppery
glare
below
the
hot
heavy
air
lay
a
rank
oppression
on
the
contorted
forms
of
those
who
made
for
sleep
on
the
pavement
and
in
it
and
through
it
all
there
rose
from
the
foul
earth
and
the
grimed
walls
a
close
mingled
stink
the
odour
of
the
jago
from
where
off
shoreditch
high
street
a
narrow
passage
set
across
with
posts
gave
menacing
entrance
on
one
end
of
old
jago
street
to
where
the
other
end
lost
itself
in
the
black
beyond
jago
row
from
where

began
south
at

to
where
it
ended
north
at

there
the
jago
for
one
hundred
years
the
blackest
pit
in
london
lay
and
festered
and
along
old
jago
street
a
narrow
archway
gave
upon
jago
court
the
blackest
hole
in
all
that
pit
a
square
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
yards
or
less
that
was
all
there
was
of
the
jago
but
in
that
square
the
human
population
swarmed
in
thousands
old

lay

at

at

stretching

all
what
was
too
vile
for

in

what
was
too
useless

all
that
teemed

old
jago
street
lay
black
and
close
under
the
quivering
red
sky
and
slinking
forms
as
of
great
rats
followed
one
another
quickly
between
the
posts
in
the

by
the

street
and
scattered
over
the

for
the
crowd
about
the
fire

now
small
the
police
was
there
in
force
and
every
safe
pocket
had
been
tried
soon
the
incursion
ceased
and
the
sky
flickering
and
brightening
no
longer
settled
to
a
sullen
flush
on
the
pavement
some
writhed
wearily
longing
for
sleep
others
despairing
of
it
sat
and
lolled
and
a
few
talked
they
were
not
there
for
lack
of
shelter
but
because
in
this
weather
repose
was
less
unlikely
in
the
street
than
within
doors
and
the
lodgings
of
the
few
who
nevertheless
abode
at
home
were
marked
here
and
there
by
the
lights
visible
from
the
windows
for
in
this
place
none
ever
slept
without
a
light
because
of
three
kinds
of
vermin
that
light
in
some
sort
keeps
at
bay
vermin
which
added
to
existence
here
a
terror
not
to
be
guessed
by
the
unafflicted
who
object
to
being
told
of
it
for
on
them
that
lay
writhen
and
gasping
on
the
pavement
on
them
that
sat
among
them
on
them
that
rolled
and
blasphemed
in
the
lighted
rooms
on
every
moving
creature
in
this
the
old
jago
day
and
night
sleeping
and
walking
the
third
plague
of
egypt
and
more
lay
unceasing
the
stifling
air
took
a
further
oppression
from
the
red
sky
by
the
dark
entrance
to
jago
court
a
man
rose
flinging
out
an
oath
and
sat
with
his
head
bowed
in
his
hands
h
h
h
he
said
wish
i
was
dead
an
kep
a
cawfy
shop
he
looked
aside
from
his
hands
at
his
neighbours
but
kiddo
cook
ideal
of
heaven
was
no
new
thing
and
the
sole
answer
was
a
snort
from
a
dozing
man
a
yard
away
kiddo
cook
felt
in
his
pocket
and
produced
a
pipe
and
a
screw
of
paper
is
a
unsocial
sort
o
evenin
party
this
is
he
said
the
real
toff
in
the
mob
with
ardly
a
pipeful

a

shocking
blimy
arter
that

ought
to
find

a
match
come
on
t
a
lank
elderly
man
who
sat
with
his
back
to
the
wall
pushed
up
a
battered
tall
hat
from
his
eyes
and
producing
a
box
of
matches
exclaimed
and
how
far
that
you
in
it
he
flung
abroad
a
bony
hand
and
glanced
upward
over
his
forehead
a
greasy
black
curl
dangled
and
shook
as
he
shuddered
back
against
the
wall
god
there
can
be
no
hell
after
this
kiddo
cook
remarked
as
he
lit
his
pipe
in
the
hollow
of
his
hands
a
comfort
mr
beveridge
he
returned
the
matches
and
the
old
man
tilting
his
hat
forward
was
silent
a
woman
gripping
a
shawl
about
her
shoulders
came
furtively
along
from
the
posts
with
a
man
walking
in
her
tracks
a
little
unsteadily
he
was
not
of
the
jago
but
a
decent
young
workman
by
his
dress
the
sight
took
kiddo
cook
idle
eye
and
when
the
couple
had
passed
he
said
meditatively
billy
leary
in
luck
missis
do
pick
up
me
i
carry
the
cosh
meself
if
i
got
a
woman
like
was
near
to
being
the
major
industry
of
the
jago
the
cosh
was
a
foot
length
of
iron
rod
with
a
knob
at
one
end
and
a
hook
or
a
ring
at
the
other
the
craftsman
carrying
it
in
his
coat
sleeve
waited
about
dark
staircase
corners
till
his
wife
married
or
not
brought
in
a
well
drunken
stranger
when
with
a
sudden
blow
behind
the
head
the
stranger
was
happily
coshed
and
whatever
was
found
on
him
as
he
lay
insensible
was
the
profit
on
the
transaction
in
the
hands
of
capable
practitioners
this
industry
yielded
a
comfortable
subsistence
for
no
great
exertion
most
of
course
depended
on
the
woman
whose
duty
it
was
to
keep
the
other
artist
going
in
subjects
there
were
legends
of
surprising
ingatherings
achieved
by
wives
of
especial
diligence
one
of
a
woman
who
had
brought
to
the
cosh
some
on
a
night
of
public
rejoicing
this
was
however
a
story
years
old
and
may
have
been
no
more
than
an
exemplary
fiction
designed
like
a
sunday
school
book
to
convey
a
counsel
of
perfection
to
the
dutiful
matrons
of
the
old
jago
the
man
and
woman
vanished
in
a
doorway
near
the
jago
row
end
where
for
some
reason
dossers
were
fewer
than
about
the
portal
of
jago
court
there
conversation
flagged
and
a
broken
snore
was
heard
it
was
a
quiet
night
as
quietness
was
counted
in
the
jago
for
it
was
too
hot
for
most
to
fight
in
that
stifling
air
too
hot
to
do
more
than
turn
on
the
stones
and
swear
still
the
last
hoarse
yelps
of
a
combat
of
women
came
intermittently
from
half
jago
street
in
the
further
confines
in
a
little
while
something
large
and
dark
was
pushed
forth
from
the
near
jago
row
which
billy
leary
spouse
had
entered
the
thing
rolled
over
and
lay
tumbled
on
the
pavement
for
a
time
unnoted
it
might
have
been
yet
another
sleeper
but
for
its
stillness
just
such
a
thing
it
seemed
belike
to
two
that
lifted
their
heads
and
peered
from
a
few
yards
off
till
they
rose
on
hands
and
knees
and
crept
to
where
it
lay
jago
rats
both
a
man
it
was
with
a
thick
smear
across
his
face
and
about
his
head
the
source
of
the
dark
trickle
that
sought
the
gutter
deviously
over
the
broken
flags
the
drab
stuff
of
his
pockets
peeped
out
here
and
there
in
a
crumpled
bunch
and
his
waistcoat
gaped
where
the
had
been
clearly
here
was
an
uncommonly
remunerative
cosh
a
cosh
so
good
that
the
boots
had
been
neglected
and
remained
on
the
man
feet
these
the
kneeling
two
unlaced
deftly
and
rising
prize
in
hand
vanished
in
the
deeper
shadow
of
jago
row
a
small
boy
whom
they
met
full
tilt
at
the
corner
staggered
out
to
the
gutter
and
flung
a
veteran
curse
after
them
he
was
a
slight
child
by
whose
size
you
might
have
judged
his
age
at
five
but
his
face
was
of
serious
and
troubled
age
one
who
knew
the
children
of
the
jago
and
could
tell
might
have
held
him
eight
or
from
that
to
nine
he
replaced
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
and
trudged
up
the
street
as
he
brushed
by
the
coshed
man
he
glanced
again
toward
jago
row
and
jerking
his
thumb
that
way
for
boots
he
piped
but
nobody
marked
him
till
he
reached
jago
court
when
old
beveridge
pushing
back
his
hat
once
more
called
sweetly
and
silkily
perrott
and
beckoned
with
his
finger
the
boy
approached
and
as
he
did
so
the
man
skeleton
hand
suddenly
shot
out
and
gripped
him
by
the
collar
never
does
to
see
too
much
beveridge
said
in
a
series
of
shouts
close
to
the
boy
ear
go
home
he
added
in
a
more
ordinary
tone
with
a
push
to
make
his
meaning
plain
and
straightway
relapsed
against
the
wall
the
boy
scowled
and
backed
off
the
pavement
his
ragged
jacket
was
coarsely
made
from
one
much
larger
and
he
hitched
the
collar
over
his
shoulder
as
he
shrank
toward
a
doorway
some
few
yards
on
front
doors
were
used
merely
as
firewood
in
the
old
jago
and
most
had
been
burnt
there
many
years
ago
if
perchance
one
could
have
been
found
still
on
its
hinges
it
stood
ever
open
and
probably
would
not
shut
thus
at
night
the
jago
doorways
were
a
row
of
black
holes
foul
and
forbidding
dicky
perrott
entered
his
hole
with
caution
for
anywhere
in
the
passage
and
on
the
stairs
somebody
might
be
lying
drunk
against
whom
it
would
be
unsafe
to
stumble
he
found
nobody
however
and
climbed
and
reckoned
his
way
up
the
first
with
the
necessary
regard
for
the
treads
that
one
might
step
through
and
the
rails
that
had
gone
from
the
side
then
he
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
back
and
was
at
home
a
little
heap
of
guttering
grease
not
long
ago
a
candle
end
stood
and
spread
on
the
and
gave
irregular
light
from
its
drooping
wick
a
iron
bedstead
bent
and
staggering
stood
against
a
wall
and
on
its
murky
coverings
a
woman
sat
and
neglected
a
baby
that
lay
by
her
grieving
and
wheezing
the
woman
had
a
long
dolorous
face
empty
of
expression
and
weak
of
mouth
you
bin
dicky
she
asked
rather
complaining
than
asking
sich
low
hours
for
a
boy
dicky
glanced
about
the
room
anythink
to
eat
he
asked
dunno
she
answered
listlessly
there

bit
o
bread
in
the
cupboard
i
do
want
nothin
it
so
an
father
ai
bin
since
the
boy
rummaged
and
found
a
crust
gnawing
at
this
he
crossed
to
where
the
baby
lay
looey
he
said
bending
and
patting
the
muddy
cheek
the
baby
turned
feebly
on
its
back
and
set
up
a
thin
wail
its
eyes
were
large
and
bright
its
tiny
face
was
piteously
and
strangely
old
she
mother
said
dicky
perrott
and
took
the
little
thing
up
he
sat
on
a
small
box
and
rocked
the
baby
on
his
knees
feeding
it
with
morsels
of
chewed
bread
the
mother
dolefully
inert
looked
on
and
said
that
backward
i
quite
wore
out
more
ten
months
old
an
do
even
crawl
yut
it
a
trouble

children
she
sighed
and
presently
stretched
herself
on
the
bed
the
boy
rose
and
carrying
his
little
sister
with
care
for
she
was
dozing
essayed
to
look
through
the
grimy
window
the
dull
flush
still
spread
overhead
but
jago
court
lay
darkling
below
with
scarce
a
sign
of
the
ruinous
back
yards
that
edged
it
on
this
and
the
opposite
sides
and
nothing
but
blackness
between
the
boy
returned
to
his
box
and
sat
then
he
said
do
father
a
sleep
outside
eh
the
woman
sat
up
with
some
show
of
energy
she
said
sharply

the

dicky
handed
over
the
baby
whose
wizen
face
was
now
relaxed
in
sleep
and
slowly
disencumbered
himself
of
the
ungainly
jacket
staring
at
the
wall
in
a
brown
study
the
mugs
wot
git
took
he
said
absently
quoddin
ai
so
bad
then
after
a
pause
he
turned
and
added
suddenly
father

smugged
some
day
eh
mother
his
mother
made
no
reply
but
bent
languidly
over
the
baby
with
an
indefinite
pretence
of
settling
it
in
a
place
on
the
bed
soon
dicky
himself
in
the
short
and
ragged
shirt
he
had
worn
under
the
jacket
burrowed
head
first
among
the
dingy
coverings
at
the
foot
and
protruding
his
head
at
the
further
side
took
his
accustomed
place
crosswise
at
the
extreme
end
the
filthy
ceiling
lit
and
darkened
by
fits
as
the
fell
and
guttered
to
its
end
he
heard
his
mother
rise
and
find
another
fragment
of
candle
to
light
by
its
expiring
flame
but
he
lay
still
wakeful
after
a
time
he
asked
why
do
you
come
to
bed
for
father
go
to
sleep
he
was
silent
for
a
little
but
brain
and
eyes
were
wide
awake
and
soon
he
spoke
again
noo
in
the
front
room
he
said
the
man
give
wife
a
yut
yut
the
boy

mighty
pertickler

father
there
was
indeed
a
step
on
the
stairs
but
it
passed
the
landing
and
went
on
to
the
top
floor
dicky
lay
awake
but
silent
gazing
upward
and
back
through
the
dirty
window
just
over
his
head
it
was
very
hot
and
he
fidgeted
uncomfortably
fearing
to
turn
or
toss
lest
the
baby
should
wake
and
cry
there
came
a
change
in
the
hue
of
the
sky
and
he
watched
the
patch
within
his
view
until
the
red
seemed
to
gather
in
spots
and
fade
a
spot
at
a
time
then
at
last
there
was
a
tread
on
the
stairs
that
stayed
at
the
door
and
father
had
come
home
dicky
lay
still
and
listened
josh
where
ye
bin
dicky
heard
his
mother
say
almost
wore
out
awright
this
in
a
hoarse
grunt
little
above
a
whisper
any
water
up
wash
this
stick
there
was
a
pause
wherein
dicky
knew
his
mother
looked
about
her
in
vacant
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
water
was
in
the
room
then
a
quick
undertoned
scream
and
the
stick
rattled
heavily
on
the
floor
sticky
his
mother
said
my
gawd
josh
look
at
that
an
bits
too
the
great
shadow
of
an
open
hand
shot
up
across
the
ceiling

was
a
murder
to
look
at
ye
i
ai
sich
a
damn
fool
as
that
pull
up
that
board
dicky
knew
the
loose
that
was
lifted
with
a
slight
groaning
jar
it
was
to
the
right
of
the
hearth
and
he
had
shammed
sleep
when
it
had
been
lifted
once
before
his
mother
whimpered
and
cried
quietly
git
in
trouble
josh
she
said
wish
you
git
a
job
josh
like
what
you
used
i
do
i

the
board
was
shut
down
again
dicky
perrott
through
one
opened
eye
saw
the
sky
a
pale
grey
above
and
hoped
the
click
had
been
a
good
one
hoped
also
that
it
might
bring
bullock
liver
for
dinner
out
in
the
jago
the
pale
dawn
brought
a
cooler
air
and
the
chance
of
sleep
from
the
paving
of
old
jago
street
sad
grey
faces
looked
upward
as
from
the
valley
of
dry
bones
down
by
jago
row
the
coshed
subject
with
the
blood
dry
on
his
face
felt
the
colder
air
and
moved
a
leg
ii
of
a
mile
east
of
the
jago
outermost
limit
was
the
east
end
elevation
mission
and
pansophical
institute
such
was
the
amazing
success
whereof
that
a
new
wing
had
been
built
and
was
now
to
be
declared
open
by
a
bishop
of
great
eminence
and
industry
the
triumphs
of
the
east
end
elevation
mission
and
pansophical
institute
were
known
and
appreciated
far
from
east
london
by
people
who
knew
less
of
that
part
than
of
asia
minor
indeed
they
were
chiefly
appreciated
by
these
there
were
kept
perpetually
on
tap
for
the
aspiring
east
ender
the
higher
life
the
greater
thought
and
the
wider
humanity
with
other
radiant
abstractions
mostly
in
the
comparative
degree
specifics
all
for
the
manufacture
of
the
superior
person
there
were
many
lectures
given
on
still
more
subjects
pictures
were
borrowed
and
shown
with
revelations
to
the
uninformed
of
the
morals
ingeniously
concealed
by
the
painters
the
uninformed
were
also
encouraged
to
debate
and
to
produce
papers
on
literary
and
political
matters
while
still
unencumbered
with
the
smallest
knowledge
thereof
for
the
enlargement
of
the
understanding
and
the
embellishment
of
the
intellect
and
there
were
classes
and
clubs
and
newspapers
and
games
of
draughts
and
musical
evenings
and
a
brass
band
whereby
the
life
of
the
hopeless
poor
might
be
coloured
and
the
misery
of
the
submerged
alleviated
the
wretches
who
crowded
to
these
benefits
were
tradesmen
sons
small
and
their
families
and
neat
clerks
with
here
and
there
a
smart
young
artisan
of
one
of
the
especially
respectable
trades
they
freely
patronised
the
clubs
the
musical
evenings
the
brass
band
and
the
bagatelle
board
and
those
who
took
themselves
seriously
debated
and
with
pomp
others
subject
to
savage
fits
of
made
short
rushes
at
random
evening
classes
with
intervals
of
disgusted
apathy
altogether
a
number
of
and
mannerly
young
men
passed
many
evenings
at
the
pansophical
institute
in
harmless
pleasures
and
often
with
an
agreeable
illusion
of
intellectual
advance
other
young
men
more
fortunately
circumstanced
with
the
educational
varnish
fresh
and
raw
upon
them
came
from
afar
equipped
with
a
foreign
mode
of
thought
and
a
proper
ignorance
of
the
world
and
the
proportions
of
things
as
missionaries
not
without
some
anxiety
to
their
parents
they
plunged
into
the
perilous
deeps
of
the
east
end
to
struggle
for
a
fortnight
with
its
suffering
and
its
brutishness
so
they
went
among
the
tradesmen
sons
and
the
shopmen
who
endured
them
as
they
endured
the
nominal
subscription
and
they
came
away
with
a
certain
relief
and
with
some
misgiving
as
to
what
impression
they
had
made
and
what
they
had
done
to
make
it
but
it
was
with
knowledge
and
authority
that
they
went
back
among
those
who
had
doubted
their
personal
safety
in
the
dark
region
the
east
end
they
reported
was
nothing
like
what
it
was
said
to
be
you
could
see
much
worse
places
up
west
the
people
were
quite
a
decent
sort
in
their
way
shocking
bounders
of
course
but
quite
clean
and
quiet
and
very
comfortably
dressed
with
ties
and
collars
and
watches
but
the
missionaries
were
few
and
the
subscribers
to
the
elevation
mission
were
many
most
had
been
convinced
by
what
they
had
been
told
by
what
they
had
read
in
charity
appeals
and
perhaps
by
what
they
had
seen
in
and
inquest
reports
that
the
whole
east
end
was
a
wilderness
of
slums
slums
packed
with
starving
human
organisms
without
minds
and
without
morals
preying
on
each
other
alive
these
subscribers
visited
the
institute
by
twos
and
threes
on
occasions
of
particular
festivity
among
the
neat
clerks
and
were
astonished
at
the
wonderful
effects
of
pansophic
elevation
on
the
degraded
classes
their
aspect
and
their
habits
perhaps
it
was
a
concert
where
nobody
was
drunk
perhaps
a
little
dance
where
nobody
howled
a
chorus
nor
wore
his
hat
nor
punched
his
partner
in
the
eye
it
was
a
great
marvel
whereunto
the
observers
testified
so
that
more
subscriptions
came
and
the
new
wing
was
built
the
afternoon
was
bright
and
all
was
promising
a
small
crowd
of
idlers
hung
about
the
main
door
of
the
institute
and
stared
at
a
string
of
flags
away
to
the
left
stood
the
new
wing
a
face
of
fair
clean
brick
the
ornamentation
of
approved
earnestness
in
squares
at
regular
intervals
within
sat
many
friends
and
relations
of
the
shopmen
and
superior
mechanics
and
waited
for
the
bishop
the
eminences
of
the
elevation
mission
sitting
apart
on
the
platform
without
among
the
idlers
waited
dicky
perrott
his
notions
of
what
were
going
on
were
indistinct
but
he
had
a
belief
imbibed
through
rumour
and
tradition
that
all
celebrations
at
such
large
buildings
were
accompanied
by
the
consumption
in
the
innermost
recesses
of
cake
and
tea
even
to
be
near
cake
was
something
in
shoreditch
high
street
was
a
shop
where
cake
stood
in
the
window
in
great
slabs
one
slab
over
another
to
an
incalculable
value
at
this
window
against
it
as
near
as
possible
his
face
flattened
white
dicky
would
stand
till
the
drove
him
off
till
he
had
but
to
shut
his
eyes
to
see
once
more
in
the
shifting
black
the
rich
yellow
sections
with
their
myriad
raisins
once
a
careless
who
had
bought
a
slice
took
so
clumsy
a
bite
as
he
emerged
that
near
a
third
of
the
whole
piece
broke
and
fell
and
this
dicky
had
snatched
from
the
paving
and
bolted
with
ere
the
owner
quite
saw
his
loss
this
was
a
superior
sort
of
cake
at
a
penny
but
once
he
had
managed
to
buy
himself
a
slice
of
an
inferior
sort
for
a
halfpenny
in
meakin
street
dicky
perrott
these
blessed
memories
in
his
brain
stood
unobtrusively
near
the
door
with
the
big
jacket
buttoned
over
as
decently
as
might
be
full
of
a
desperate
design
which
was
to
get
inside
by
whatsoever
manner
of
trick
or
opportunity
he
might
and
so
if
it
were
humanly
possible
to
the
cake
the
tickets
were
being
taken
at
the
door
by
an
ardent
young
elevator
one
of
the
missionaries
him
and
all
such
washed
and
people
dicky
had
learnt
to
hold
in
serene
contempt
when
the
business
in
hand
was
dodging
there
was
no
hurry
the
elevator
might
waste
his
vigilance
on
the
for
some
time
yet
and
dicky
knew
better
than
to
betray
the
smallest
sign
of
a
desire
for
entrance
while
his
enemy
attention
was
awake
carriages
drew
up
and
yielded
more
eminences
toward
the
end
the
bishop
himself
whom
dicky
observed
but
as
a
old
gentleman
in
uncommon
clothes
and
on
whom
he
bestowed
no
more
thought
than
a
passing
wonder
at
what
might
be
the
accident
to
his
hat
which
had
necessitated
its
repair
with
string
but
at
the
spikes
of
the
bishop
carriage
came
another
and
out
of
that
there
got
three
ladies
friends
of
the
on
whom
they
closed
greeting
and
shaking
hands
and
in
a
flash
dicky
perrott
was
beyond
the
lobby
and
moving
obscurely
along
the
walls
of
the
inner
hall
behind
pillars
and
in
shadow
seeking
cake
the
choral
society
sang
their
lustiest
and
there
were
speeches
eminences
expressed
their
surprise
and
delight
at
finding
the
people
of
the
east
end
gathered
in
the
institute
building
so
respectable
and
clean
thanks
to
persistent
indefatigable
unselfish
elevation
the
good
bishop
amid
clapping
of
hands
and
fluttering
of
handkerchiefs
piped
cherubically
of
everything
he
rejoiced
to
see
that
day
whereon
the
helping
hand
of
the
west
was
so
unmistakably
made
apparent
in
the
east
he
rejoiced
also
to
find
himself
in
the
midst
of
so
admirably
typical
an
assemblage
so
representative
if
he
might
say
so
of
that
great
east
end
of
london
thirsting
and
crying
out
for
for
elevation
for
that
ah
elevation
which
the
more
fortunately
circumstanced
denizens
of
of
other
places
had
so
munificently
laid
on
the
people
of
the
east
end
had
been
sadly
misrepresented
in
popular
periodicals
and
in
in
other
ways
the
east
end
he
was
convinced
was
not
so
black
as
it
was
painted
applause
he
had
but
to
look
about
him
he
questioned
whether
so
and
respectable
a
gathering
could
be
brought
together
in
any
west
end
parish
with
which
he
was
acquainted
it
was
his
most
pleasant
duty
on
this
occasion
and
so
on
and
so
forth
dicky
perrott
had
found
the
cake
it
was
in
a
much
smaller
room
at
the
back
of
the
hall
wherein
it
was
expected
that
the
bishop
and
certain
eminences
of
the
platform
would
refresh
themselves
with
tea
after
the
ceremony
there
were
heavy
drooping
curtains
at
the
door
of
this
room
and
deep
from
the
largest
folds
the
ratling
from
the
jago
watched
the
table
was
guarded
by
a
man
just
such
a
man
as
drove
him
from
the
window
of
the
cake
shop
in
shoreditch
high
street
nobody
else
was
there
yet
and
plainly
the
man
must
be
absent
or
busy
ere
the
cake
could
be
got
at
there
was
a
burst
of
applause
in
the
hall
the
new
wing
had
been
declared
open
then
there
was
more
singing
and
after
that
much
shuffling
and
tramping
for
everybody
was
free
to
survey
the
new
rooms
on
the
way
out
and
the
importances
from
the
platform
came
to
find
the
tea
filling
the
room
and
standing
about
in
little
groups
chatting
munching
and
sipping
while
the
man
distractedly
floundered
amid
crockery
not
a
soul
of
them
all
perceived
an
inconsiderable
small
boy
ducking
and
dodging
vaguely
among
legs
and
round
skirts
making
from
time
to
time
a
silent
snatch
at
a
plate
on
the
table
and
presently
he
vanished
altogether
then
the
amiable
bishop
beaming
over
the
six
inches
from
his
chin
at
two
courtiers
of
the
clergy
bethought
him
of
a
dinner
engagement
and
passed
his
hand
downward
over
the
rotundity
of
his
waistcoat
dear
said
the
bishop
glancing
down
suddenly
become
of
my
watch
there
hung
three
inches
of
black
ribbon
with
a
cut
end
the
bishop
looked
blankly
at
the
elevators
about
him
three
streets
off
dicky
perrott
with
his
shut
fist
deep
in
his
breeches
pocket
and
a
gold
watch
in
the
fist
ran
full
drive
for
the
old
jago
iii
there
was
nobody
in
chase
but
dicky
perrott
excited
by
his
novel
exploit
ran
hard
forgetting
the
lesson
first
learnt
by
every
child
of
the
jago
to
avoid
as
far
as
may
be
suspicious
flight
in
open
streets
he
burst
into
the
old
jago
from
the
jago
row
corner
by
meakin
street
and
still
he
ran
a
small
boy
a
trifle
bigger
than
himself
made
a
sharp
punch
at
him
as
he
passed
but
he
took
no
heed
the
hulking
group
at
the
corner
of
old
jago
street
ever
observant
of
weaklings
with
plunder
saw
him
and
one
tried
to
catch
his
arm
but
he
had
the
wit
to
dodge
past
the
jago
court
passage
he
scudded
in
at
the
familiar
doorway
and
up
the
stairs
a
pale
hunchbacked
child
clean
and
wistful
descended
and
him
dicky
flung
aside
and
half
downstairs
with
out
josh
perrott
sat
on
the
bed
eating
fried
fish
from
an
oily
paper
for
it
was
he
was
a
man
of
of
middle
height
and
stoutly
built
with
a
hard
leathery
face
as
of
one
much
older
the
hair
about
his
mouth
seemed
always
three
days
old
never
much
less
nor
much
more
he
was
a
plasterer
had
at
least
so
described
himself
at
but
it
was
long
since
he
had
plastered
though
he
still
walked
abroad
splashed
and
speckled
as
though
from
an
eruption
of
inherent
plaster
in
moments
of
pride
he
declared
himself
the
only
member
of
his
family
who
had
ever
learned
a
trade
and
worked
at
it
it
was
a
long
relinquished
habit
but
while
it
lasted
he
had
married
a
decent
daughter
who
had
known
nothing
of
the
jago
till
these
latter
days
one
other
boast
josh
perrott
had
that
nothing
but
shot
or
pointed
steel
could
hurt
him
and
this
too
was
near
being
a
true
boast
as
he
had
proved
in
more
than
one
fight
in
the
local
arena
which
was
jago
court
now
he
sat
peaceably
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
plucked
with
his
fingers
at
the
oily
fish
while
his
wife
grubbed
hopelessly
about
the
cupboard
shelves
for
the
screw
of
paper
which
was
the
dicky
entered
at
a
burst
father
look
i
done
a
click

clock
a
red
josh
perrott
stopped

and
hand
with
a
pinch
of
fish
poised
in
air
the
woman
turned
and
her
chin
fell

dicky
she
cried
in
real
distress

awful
low
wicked

so
josh
perrott
bolted
the
pinch
of
fish
and
sucked
his
fingers
as
he
sprang
to
the
door
after
a
quick
glance
down
the
stairs
he
shut
it
and
turned
to
dicky
get
that
ye
young
devel
he
asked
and
snatched
the
watch

auf
a
ol

treasured
relic

and
handle
found
in
a
gutter
cher
goin
to
let
a
look
at
it
josh
perrott
looked
doubtfully
toward
his
wife
the
children
were
chiefly
her
concern
of
her
sentiments
there
could
be
no
mistake
he
slipped
the
watch
into
his
own
pocket
and
caught
dicky
by
the
collar
give
you
somethink
you
dam
young
thief
he
exclaimed
slipping
off
his
belt
like
to
have
us
all
in
stir
for
a
year
or
two
i
goin
thievin
watches
like
a
man
and
he
plied
the
belt
savagely
while
dicky
amazed
breathless
and
choking
spun
about
him
with
piteous
squeals
and
the
baby
woke
and
puled
in
feeble
sympathy
there
was
a
rip
and
the
collar
began
to
leave
the
old
jacket
feeling
this
josh
perrott
released
it
and
with
a
quick
drive
of
the
fist
in
the
neck
sent
dicky
staggering
across
the
room
dicky
caught
at
the
bed
frame
and
limped
out
to
the
landing
sobbing
grievously
in
the
bend
of
his
sleeve
it
was
more
than
his
mother
had
intended
but
she
knew
better
than
to
attempt
interference
now
that
he
was
gone
she
said
with
some
hesitation
you
better
take
it
out
at
once
josh
i
goin
josh
replied
turning
the
watch
in
his
hand
a
good
a
topper
you
wo
let
weech
it
will
ye
josh
never
gives
much
bloomin
fear
i
goin
up
with
this
dicky
sobbed
his
way
down
the
stairs
and
through
the
passage
to
the
back
in
the
yard
he
looked
for
tommy
rann
to
sympathise
but
tommy
was
not
and
dicky
paused
in
his
grief
to
reflect
that
perhaps
indeed
in
the
light
of
calm
reason
he
would
rather
cast
the
story
of
the
watch
in
a
more
heroic
mould
for
tommy
benefit
than
was
compatible
with
tears
and
a
belted
back
so
he
turned
and
squeezed
through
a
hole
in
the
broken
fence
sobbing
again
in
search
of
the
friend
that
shared
his
inmost
sorrows
the
belting
was
bad
very
bad
there
was
broken
skin
on
his
shins
where
the
strap
had
curled
round
and
there
was
a
little
sticky
blood
under
the
shirt
half
way
up
his
back
to
say
nothing
of
bruises
but
it
was
the
hopeless
injustice
of
things
that
shook
him
to
the
soul
wholly
unaided
he
had
done
with
neatness
and
credit
a
click
that
anybody
in
the
jago
would
have
been
proud
of
overjoyed
he
had
hastened
to
receive
the
commendations
of
his
father
and
mother
and
to
place
the
prize
in
their
hands
freely
and
generously
though
perhaps
with
some
hope
of
hot
supper
by
way
of
celebration
and
his
reward
was
this
why
he
could
understand
nothing
could
but
feel
the
wrong
that
broke
his
heart
and
so
sobbing
he
crawled
through
two
fences
to
weep
on
the
shaggy
neck
of
jerry
gullen
canary
jerry
gullen
canary
was
no
bird
but
a
donkey
employed
by
jerry
gullen
in
his
occasional
intervals
of
sobriety
to
drag
a
cranky
shallow
sometimes
stored
with
glass
bottles
rags
and
sometimes
with
firewood
manufactured
from
a
convenient
hoarding
or
from
the
joinery
of
an
empty
house
sometimes
with
empty
sacks
covering
miscellaneous
property
suddenly
acquired
and
not
for
general
inspection
his
vacations
many
and
long
jerry
gullen
canary
spent
forgotten
and
unfed
in
jerry
gullen
gnawing
desperately
at
fences
and
harrowing
the
neighbourhood
with
his
bray
thus
the
nickname
facetiously
applied
by
kiddo
cook
in
celebration
of
his
piteous
song
grew
into
use
and
would
call
the
creature
attention
as
readily
as
a
mouthful
of
imprecations
jerry
gullen
canary
was
gnawing
gnawing
with
a
sound
as
of
a
crooked
everywhere
about
the
foul
yard
ten
or
twelve
feet
square
wood
was
rounded
and
splintered
and
bitten
white
and
as
the
donkey
turned
his
heavy
head
a
drip
of
blood
from
his
gums
made
a
disc
on
the
stones
a
twitch
of
the
ears
welcomed
dicky
as
he
was
for
it
was
commonly
thus
that
he
bethought
him
of
solace
in
jerry
gullen
and
so
dicky
his
arms
about
the
mangy
neck
told
the
tale
of
his
wrongs
till
consolation
came
in
composition
of
the
heroic
narrative
designed
for
tommy
rann
canary
it
is
a
blasted
shame
iv
when
dicky
perrott
came
running
into
jago
row
with
the
bishop
watch
in
his
pocket
another
boy
punched
a
fist
at
him
and
at
the
time
dicky
was
at
a
loss
to
guess
the
cause
unless
it
were
a
simple
caprice
but
stayed
neither
to
inquire
nor
to
retaliate
the
fact
was
that
the
ranns
and
the
learys
were
coming
out
fighting
was
in
the
air
and
the
small
boy
meeting
another
a
trifle
smaller
punched
on
general
principles
the
ranns
and
the
learys
ever
at
war
or
in
guarded
armistice
were
the
great
rival
families
the
montagues
and
the
capulets
of
the
old
jago
the
learys
indeed
scarce
pretended
to
rivalry
rather
to
factious
opposition
for
the
ranns
gloried
in
the
style
and
title
of
the
family
and
dominated
the
jago
but
there
were
mighty
fighters
men
and
women
among
the
learys
and
when
a
combat
arose
it
was
a
hard
one
and
an
animated
the
two
families
ramified
throughout
the
jago
and
under
the
rann
standard
whether
by
kin
or
by
custom
were
the
gullens
the
fishers
the
spicers
and
the
walshes
while
in
the
leary
train
came
dawsons
greens
and
harnwells
so
that
near
all
the
jago
was
wont
to
be
on
one
side
or
the
other
and
any
of
the
jago
which
was
not
was
apt
to
be
the
worse
for
it
for
the
ranns
drubbed
all
them
that
were
not
of
their
faction
in
the
most
thorough
and
most
workmanlike
manner
and
the
learys
held
by
the
same
practice
so
that
neutrality
meant
double
drubbing
but
when
the
ranns
and
learys
combined
and
the
old
jago
issued
forth
in
its
entire
might
against
dove
lane
then
the
battle
was
one
to
go
miles
to
see
this
however
was
but
a
rann
and
leary
fight
and
it
was
but
in
its
early
stages
when
dicky
perrott
emerging
from
jerry
gullen
made
for
shoreditch
high
street
by
way
of
the
the
passage
with
posts
at
the
end
of
old
jago
street
his
purpose
was
to
snatch
a
handful
of
hay
from
some
passing
waggon
or
of
mixed
fodder
from
some
unguarded
nosebag
wherewith
to
reward
the
sympathy
of
jerry
canary
but
by
the
at
the
edge
lane
corner
tommy
rann
capless
and
with
a
purple
bump
on
his
forehead
came
flying
into
his
arms
breathless
exultant
a
babbling
braggart
he
had
fought
johnny
leary
and
joe
dawson
he
said
one
after
the
other
and
pretty
nigh
broke
johnny
leary
blasted
neck
and
joe
dawson
big
brother
was
after
him
now
with
a
shovel
so
the
two
children
ran
on
together
and
sought
the
seclusion
of
their
own
back
yard
where
the
story
of
johnny
rann
prowess
with
scowls
and
the
pounding
of
imaginary
foes
and
the
story
of
the
bishop
watch
with
suppressions
and
improvements
mingled
and
contended
in
the
thickening
dusk
and
jerry
gullen
canary
went
forgotten
and
unrequited
that
night
fighting
was
sporadic
and
desultory
in
the
jago
bob
the
bender
was
reported
to
have
a
smashed
nose
and
sam
cash
had
his
head
bandaged
at
the
hospital
at
the
bag
of
nails
in
edge
lane
snob
spicer
was
knocked
out
of
knowledge
with
a
quart
pot
and
cocko
missis
had
a
piece
bitten
off
of
one
ear
as
the
night
wore
on
taunts
and
defiances
were
bandied
from
window
to
door
and
from
door
to
window
between
those
who
intended
to
begin
fighting
and
shouts
from
divers
corners
gave
notice
of
isolated
scuffles
once
a
succession
of
piercing
screams
seemed
to
betoken
that
sally
green
had
begun
there
was
a
note
in
the
screams
of
sally
green
opposites
which
the
jago
had
learned
to
recognise
sally
green
though
of
the
weaker
faction
was
the
female
champion
of
the
old
jago
an
eminence
won
and
kept
by
fighting
tactics
peculiar
to
herself
for
it
was
her
way
reserving
teeth
and
nails
to
wrestle
closely
with
her
antagonist
throw
her
by
a
dexterous
twist
on
her
face
and
fall
on
her
instantly
seizing
the
victim
nape
in
her
teeth
gnawing
and
worrying
the
sufferer
screams
were
audible
afar
and
beyond
their
invariable
eccentricity
of
quality
a
quality
a
vaguely
suggestive
of
dire
surprise
they
had
mechanical
persistence
a
regularity
that
distinguished
them
in
the
accustomed
ear
from
other
screams
josh
perrott
had
not
been
home
all
the
evening
probably
the
watch
was
in
course
of
transmutation
into
beer
dicky
stiff
and
domestically
inclined
nursed
looey
and
listened
to
the
noises
without
till
he
fell
asleep
in
hopeful
anticipation
of
the
morrow
for
tommy
rann
had
promised
him
half
of
a
broken
iron
railing
wherewith
to
fight
the
learys
v
sleep
in
the
jago
was
at
best
a
thing
of
intermission
for
reasons
reasons
of
multitude
already
denoted
nevertheless
dicky
slept
well
enough
to
be
unconscious
of
his
father
homecoming
in
the
morning
however
there
lay
josh
perrott
snoring
thunderously
on
the
floor
piebald
with
this
was
not
a
morning
whereon
father
would
want
breakfast
that
was
plain
he
would
wake
thirsty
and
savage
so
dicky
made
sure
of
a
crust
from
the
cupboard
and
betook
himself
in
search
of
tommy
rann
as
to
washing
he
was
never
especially
fond
of
it
and
in
any
case
there
were
fifty
excellent
excuses
for
neglect
the
only
water
was
that
from
the
little
tap
in
the
back
yard
the
little
tap
was
usually
out
of
order
or
had
been
stolen
bodily
by
a
tenant
and
if
it
were
not
there
was
no
basin
there
nor
any
soap
nor
towel
and
anything
savouring
of
moderate
cleanliness
was
resented
in
the
jago
as
an
assumption
of
superiority
fighting
began
early
fast
and
furious
the
ranns
got
together
soon
and
hunted
the
learys
up
and
down
and
attacked
them
in
their
houses
the
learys
chances
only
coming
when
straggling
ranns
were
cut
off
from
the
main
body
the
weapons
in
use
as
was
customary
rose
in
effectiveness
by
a
swiftly
ascending
scale
the
learys
assailed
with
sticks
replied
with
sticks
torn
from
old
with
protruding
nails
the
two
sides
bethought
them
of
coshes
simultaneously
and
such
as
had
no
coshes
very
few
had
pokers
and
iron
railings
ginger
stagg
at
bay
in
his
passage
laid
open
pud
palmer
cheek
with
a
chisel
and
knives
thus
happily
legitimised
with
the
least
possible
preliminary
form
everybody
was
free
to
lay
hold
of
whatever
came
handy
in
old
jago
street
half
way
between
jago
court
and
edge
lane
stood
the
feathers
the
grimiest
and
vilest
of
the
four
in
the
jago
into
the
feathers
some
dozen
learys
were
driven
and
for
a
while
they
held
the
inner
bar
and
the
against
the
ranns
who
swarmed
after
them
chairs
bottles
and
pewter
pots
flying
thick
while
mother
gapp
the
landlady
hung
hysterical
on
the
in
the
bar
supplicating
and
blubbering
aloud
then
a
partition
came
down
with
a
crash
bringing
shelves
and
many
glasses
with
it
and
the
ranns
rushed
over
the
ruin
beating
the
learys
down
jumping
on
them
heaving
them
through
the
back
windows
having
thus
cleared
the
house
of
the
intruding
enemy
the
ranns
demanded
recompense
of
liquor
and
took
it
dragging
handles
off
seizing
bottles
breaking
into
the
cellar
and
driving
in
bungs
nobody
better
than
mother
gapp
could
quell
an
ordinary
bar
riot
even
to
knocking
a
man
down
with
a
pot
but
she
knew
better
than
to
attempt
interference
now
nothing
could
have
made
her
swoon
but
she
sat
limp
and
helpless
weeping
and
blaspheming
the
ranns
cleared
off
every
man
with
a
bottle
or
so
and
scattered
and
this
for
a
while
was
their
undoing
for
the
learys
rallied
and
hunted
the
ranns
in
their
turn
a
crowd
of
eighty
or
a
hundred
sweeping
the
jago
from
honey
lane
to
meakin
street
then
they
swung
back
through
edge
lane
to
old
jago
street
and
made
for
jerry
gullen
a
house
full
of
ranns
jerry
gullen
bill
rann
and
the
rest
took
refuge
in
the
upper
floors
and
barricaded
the
stairs
below
the
learys
broke
windows
and
ravaged
the
rooms
smashing
whatsoever
of
furniture
was
to
be
found
above
pip
walsh
who
affected
horticulture
on
his
hurled
down
on
the
stairs
billy
leary
scaling
the
barricade
was
flung
from
top
to
bottom
and
had
to
be
carried
home
and
then
pip
walsh
missis
scattered
the
besiegers
on
the
pavement
below
with
a
kettleful
of
boiling
water
there
was
a
sudden
sortie
of
ranns
from
jago
court
but
it
profited
nothing
for
the
party
was
small
and
its
advent
being
unexpected
there
was
a
lack
of
prompt
from
the
house
the
learys
held
the
field
down
the
middle
of
old
jago
street
came
sally
green
red
faced
stripped
to
the
waist
dancing
hoarse
and
triumphant
wide
as
the
finger
striped
her
back
her
face
and
her
throat
and
she
had
a
black
eye
but
in
one
great
hand
she
dangled
a
long
bunch
of
clotted
hair
as
she
whooped
defiance
to
the
jago
it
was
a
trophy
newly
rent
from
the
scalp
of
norah
walsh
champion
of
the
rann
womankind
who
had
crawled
away
to
hide
her
blighted
head
and
be
restored
with
gin
none
answered
sally
challenge
and
staying
but
to
fling
a
brickbat
at
pip
walsh
window
she
carried
her
dance
and
her
trophy
into
edge
lane
the
scrimmage
on
jerry
gullen
stairs
was
thundering
anew
and
parties
of
learys
were
making
for
other
houses
in
the
street
when
there
came
a
volley
of
yells
from
jago
row
heralding
a
scudding
mob
of
ranns
the
defeated
from
jago
court
driven
back
had
gained
new
jago
street
by
way
of
the
behind
the
court
and
set
to
gathering
the
scattered
faction
now
the
ranns
came
drunk
and
otherwise
and
the
learys
leaving
jerry
gullen
rushed
to
meet
them
there
was
a
great
shock
hats
flew
sticks
and
heads
made
a
wooden
rattle
and
instantly
the
two
mobs
were
broken
into
an
uproarious
confusion
of
tangled
groups
howling
and
grappling
here
a
man
crawled
into
a
passage
to
nurse
a
broken
head
there
a
knot
gathered
to
kick
a
sprawling
foe
so
the
fight
thinned
out
and
spread
resolving
into
many
independent
combats
with
concerted
rushes
of
less
and
less
frequency
till
once
again
all
through
the
jago
each
fought
for
his
own
hand
kiddo
cook
always
humorous
ran
hilariously
through
the
streets
brandishing
a
long
roll
of
twisted
paper
wherewith
he
smacked
the
heads
of
learys
all
and
sundry
who
realised
too
late
that
the
paper
was
twisted
round
a
poker
now
of
the
few
neutral
jagos
most
lay
low
josh
perrott
however
hard
as
nails
and
respected
for
it
feared
neither
rann
nor
leary
and
leaving
a
little
money
with
his
missis
carried
his
morning
mouth
in
search
of
beer
pigeony
poll
harlot
and
outcast
despised
for
that
she
neither
fought
nor
kept
a
like
a
respectable
married
woman
slunk
and
trembled
in
corners
and
yards
and
wept
at
the
sight
of
bleeding
heads
as
for
old
beveridge
the
affair
so
grossly
excited
him
that
he
neglected
business
he
cadged
and
wrote
begging
screeves
and
stayed
in
the
jago
where
he
strode
wildly
about
the
streets
lank
and
rusty
stabbing
the
air
with
a
carving
knife
and
incoherently
defying
the
lot
to
come
near
him
nobody
did
dicky
perrott
and
tommy
rann
found
a
snug
fastness
in
jago
row
for
there
was
a
fence
with
a
loose
board
which
pushed
aside
revealed
a
hole
a
very
small
boy
might
squeeze
and
within
were
stored
many
barrows
and
shallows
mostly
broken
and
of
these
one
tilted
forward
and
bottom
up
made
a
hut
or
den
screened
about
with
fence
and
barrows
here
they
hid
while
the
learys
swept
the
jago
and
hence
they
issued
from
time
to
time
to
pound
such
youngsters
of
the
other
side
as
might
come
in
sight
the
bits
of
iron
railing
made
imposing
weapons
but
were
a
trifle
too
big
and
heavy
for
rapid
use
in
their
puny
hands
still
dicky
managed
to
double
up
little
billy
leary
with
a
timely
lunge
in
the
stomach
and
tommy
rann
made
bobby
nose
bleed
very
satisfactorily
on
the
other
hand
the
bump
on
tommy
rann
forehead
was
widened
by
the
visitation
of
a
stick
and
dicky
perrott
sustained
a
very
hopeful
punch
in
the
eye
which
he
cherished
enthusiastically
with
a
view
to
an
honourable
blackness
in
the
snuggery
intervals
they
explained
their
prowess
one
to
another
and
dicky
alluded
to
his
intention
when
he
was
a
man
to
buy
a
very
long
sword
wherewith
to
cut
off
the
learys
heads
tommy
rann
inclining
however
to
a
gun
with
which
one
might
also
shoot
birds
the
battle
flagged
a
little
toward
but
waxed
lively
again
as
the
afternoon
began
it
was
then
that
dicky
perrott
venturing
some
way
from
the
retreat
found
himself
in
a
scrimmage
and
a
man
snatched
away
his
piece
of
iron
and
floored
a
leary
with
it
gratifying
as
was
the
distinction
of
aiding
in
the
exploit
dicky
mourned
the
loss
of
the
weapon
almost
unto
tears
and
tommy
rann
would
not
go
with
the
other
but
kept
it
wholly
for
himself
so
dicky
was
fain
to
hunt
sorrowfully
for
a
mere
stick
even
a
disengaged
stick
was
not
easy
to
find
just
then
so
dicky
emerging
from
the
jago
tried
meakin
street
where
there
were
shops
but
unsuccessfully
and
so
came
round
by
luck
row
a
narrow
way
from
meakin
street
by
walker
cook
shop
up
through
the
jago
dicky
mother
left
with
the
baby
fastened
the
door
as
well
as
she
might
and
trembled
indeed
she
had
reason
the
time
of
josh
return
was
a
matter
of
doubt
but
when
he
did
come
he
would
want
something
to
eat
it
was
for
that
he
had
left
the
money
but
dicky
was
out
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
cupboard
from
the
window
she
saw
divers
fights
in
jago
court
and
a
man
lay
for
near
two
hours
on
the
stones
with
a
cut
on
his
temple
as
for
herself
she
was
no
favourite
in
the
neighbourhood
at
any
time
for
one
thing
her
husband
did
not
carry
the
cosh
then
she
was
an
alien
who
had
never
entirely
fallen
into
jago
ways
she
had
soon
grown
sluttish
and
dirty
but
she
was
never
drunk
she
never
quarrelled
she
did
not
gossip
freely
also
her
husband
beat
her
but
rarely
and
then
not
with
a
chair
nor
a
poker
justly
irritated
by
such
superiorities
as
these
the
women
of
the
jago
were
to
brook
another
which
was
that
hannah
perrott
had
been
married
in
church
for
these
reasons
she
was
timid
at
the
most
peaceful
of
times
but
now
with
ranns
and
learys
on
the
and
herself
obnoxious
to
both
she
trembled
she
wished
dicky
would
come
and
do
her
errand
but
there
was
no
sign
of
him
and
wore
into
afternoon
it
was
late
for
josh
as
it
was
and
he
would
be
sure
to
come
home
irritable
it
was
his
way
when
a
bad
head
from
overnight
struggled
with
morning
beer
if
he
found
nothing
to
eat
there
would
be
trouble
at
length
she
resolved
to
go
herself
there
was
a
lull
in
the
outer
din
and
what
there
was
seemed
to
come
from
the
farther
parts
of
honey
lane
and
jago
row
she
would
slip
across
by
luck
row
to
meakin
street
and
be
back
in
five
minutes
she
took
up
little
looey
and
went
and
as
dicky
stickless
turned
into
luck
row
there
arose
a
loud
shriek
and
then
another
and
then
in
a
changed
voice
a
succession
of
long
screams
with
a
regular
sally
green
again
he
ran
turned
into
old
jago
street
and
saw
sprawled
on
her
face
in
the
foul
road
lay
a
writhing
woman
and
screamed
while
squeezed
under
her
arm
was
a
baby
with
mud
in
its
eyes
and
a
cut
cheek
crying
weakly
and
spread
over
all
clutching
her
prey
by
hair
and
wrist
sally
green
hung
on
the
nape
like
a
terrier
jaws
clenched
head
shaking
thus
dicky
saw
it
in
a
flash
and
in
an
instant
he
had
flung
himself
on
sally
green
kicking
striking
biting
and
crying
for
he
had
seen
his
mother
and
looey
the
kicks
wasted
themselves
among
the
petticoats
and
the
blows
were
feeble
but
the
sharp
teeth
were
meeting
in
the
when
help
came
norah
walsh
vanquished
champion
now
somewhat
recovered
looked
from
a
window
saw
her
enemy
vulnerable
and
ran
out
armed
with
a
bottle
she
stopped
at
the
kerb
to
knock
the
bottom
off
the
bottle
and
then
with
an
exultant
shout
seized
sally
green
by
the
hair
and
stabbed
her
about
the
face
with
the
jagged
points
blinded
with
blood
sally
released
her
hold
on
mrs
perrott
and
rolled
on
her
back
struggling
fiercely
but
to
no
end
for
norah
walsh
kneeling
on
her
breast
stabbed
and
stabbed
again
till
pieces
of
the
bottle
broke
away
sally
yells
and
plunges
ceased
and
a
man
pulled
norah
off
on
him
she
turned
and
he
was
fain
to
run
while
certain
learys
found
a
truck
which
might
carry
sally
to
the
hospital
hannah
perrott
was
gone
indoors
hysterical
and
helpless
she
had
scarce
crossed
the
street
on
her
errand
when
she
had
met
sally
green
in
quest
of
female
ranns
mrs
perrott
was
not
a
rann
but
she
was
not
a
leary
so
it
came
to
the
same
thing
moreover
there
was
her
general
obnoxiousness
she
had
tried
to
run
but
that
was
useless
and
now
sobbing
and
bleeding
she
was
merely
conscious
of
being
gently
led
almost
carried
indoors
and
upstairs
she
was
laid
back
on
the
bed
and
somebody
loosened
her
hair
and
wiped
her
face
and
neck
giving
her
hoarse
comforting
words
then
she
saw
the
face
scared
though
coarse
and
pitted
and
red
about
the
eyes
that
bent
over
her
it
was
pigeony
poll
dicky
had
followed
her
in
no
longer
the
hero
of
the
jago
row
retreat
but
with
his
face
tearful
and
distorted
carrying
the
baby
in
his
arms
and
wiping
the
mud
from
her
eyes
now
he
sat
on
the
little
box
and
continued
his
ministrations
with
fear
in
his
looks
as
he
glanced
at
his
mother
on
the
bed
without
the
fight
rallied
once
more
the
learys
ran
to
avenge
sally
green
and
the
ranns
met
them
with
a
will
down
by
the
bag
of
nails
a
party
of
ranns
was
driven
between
the
posts
and
through
the
gut
into
shoreditch
high
street
where
a
stand
was
made
until
fag
dawson
dropped
with
a
shoemaker
knife
sticking
under
his
then
the
ranns
left
with
most
of
the
learys
after
them
and
fag
dawson
was
carried
to
a
chemist
by
the
police
never
to
floor
a
rann
again
for
he
was
chived
in
the
left
lung
thus
the
fight
ended
for
a
faction
fight
in
the
jago
with
a
few
broken
heads
and
ribs
and
an
odd
knife
wound
here
and
there
even
with
a
death
in
the
hospital
from
kicks
or
what
not
was
all
very
well
but
when
it
came
to
homicide
in
the
open
high
street
the
police
drew
the
line
and
entered
the
jago
in
force
ordinarily
a
peep
now
and
again
from
a
couple
of
policemen
between
the
was
all
the
supervision
the
jago
had
although
three
policemen
had
been
seen
to
walk
the
length
of
old
jago
street
together
and
there
were
raids
in
force
for
special
captures
there
was
a
raid
in
force
now
and
the
turmoil
ceased
nothing
would
have
pleased
both
ranns
and
learys
better
than
to
knock
over
two
or
three
policemen
for
but
there
were
too
many
for
the
sport
and
for
hours
they
patrolled
the
jago
closest
passages
of
course
nobody
knew
who
chived
fag
dawson
no
inquiring
policeman
ever
found
anybody
in
the
old
jago
who
knew
anything
even
to
the
harm
of
his
bitterest
foe
it
was
the
sole
commandment
that
ran
there
shalt
not
nark
that
night
it
was
known
that
there
would
be
a
fight
between
josh
perrott
and
billy
leary
once
the
latter
grew
well
for
josh
perrott
came
home
saw
his
wife
and
turned
rann
on
the
spot
but
for
the
police
in
the
jago
that
night
there
would
have
been
many
a
sore
head
if
no
worse
among
the
learys
by
visitation
of
josh
perrott
sally
green
husband
had
fled
years
ago
and
billy
leary
her
brother
was
the
obvious
mark
for
josh
vengeance
he
was
near
as
eminent
a
fighter
among
the
men
as
his
sister
among
the
women
and
a
charming
scrap
was
anticipated
it
would
come
off
of
course
in
jago
court
one
sunday
morning
as
all
fights
of
distinction
did
and
perhaps
somebody
in
the
high
mob
would
put
up
stakes
vi
in
the
morning
the
police
still
held
the
jago
their
presence
embarrassed
many
but
none
more
than
dicky
perrott
who
would
always
take
a
turning
or
walk
the
other
way
at
sight
of
a
policeman
dicky
got
out
of
old
jago
street
early
and
betook
him
to
meakin
street
where
there
were
chandlers
shops
with
sugar
in
their
windows
and
with
pudding
he
designed
working
through
by
these
to
shoreditch
high
street
there
to
crown
his
solace
by
contemplation
of
the
but
as
he
neared
weech
scarce
half
through
meakin
street
there
stood
weech
himself
at
the
door
grinning
and
nodding
affably
and
beckoning
him
he
was
a
pleasant
man
this
mr
aaron
weech
who
sang
hymns
aloud
in
the
back
parlour
and
hummed
the
tunes
in
the
shop
a
prosperous
whiskered
smirking
tradesman
who
bent
and
spoke
amiably
to
boys
looking
sharply
in
their
eyes
but
talked
to
a
man
mostly
with
his
gaze
on
the
man
waistcoat
indeed
there
seemed
to
be
something
about
mr
aaron
weech
especially
attractive
to
youth
nearly
all
his
customers
were
boys
and
girls
though
not
boys
and
girls
who
looked
likely
to
pay
a
great
deal
in
the
way
of
refreshment
much
as
they
took
but
he
was
ever
indulgent
and
at
all
times
accessible
to
his
young
clients
even
on
sunday
though
of
course
his
shutters
were
kept
rigidly
up
on
the
day
of
rest
a
particular
tap
would
bring
him
to
the
door
not
to
sell
coffee
for
mr
weech
was
no
now
he
stood
at
his
door
and
invited
dicky
with
nods
and
becks
dicky
all
wondering
and
alert
to
dodge
in
case
the
thing
were
a
mere
device
to
bring
him
within
striking
distance
went
dicky
perrott
quoth
mr
weech
in
a
tone
of
genial
surprise
you
could
drink
a
cup
o
cawfy
dicky
wondering
how
mr
weech
had
learnt
his
name
believed
he
could
eat
a
slice
o
cake
too
i
be
bound
mr
weech
added
dicky
glance
leapt
yes
he
could
eat
a
slice
of
cake
too
i
knew
it
said
mr
weech
triumphantly
can
always
tell
he
rubbed
dicky
cap
about
his
head
and
drew
him
into
the
shop
at
this
hour
bare
of
customers
at
the
innermost
compartment
they
stopped
and
mr
weech
with
a
gentle
pressure
on
the
shoulders
seated
dicky
at
the
table
he
brought
the
coffee
and
not
a
single
slice
of
cake
but
two
true
it
was
not
cake
of
elevation
mission
quality
nor
was
it
so
good
as
that
shown
at
the
shop
in
high
street
it
was
of
a
browner
dumpier
harder
nature
and
the
currants
were
gritty
and
few
but
cake
it
was
and
to
consider
it
critically
were
unworthy
dicky
bolted
it
with
less
comfort
than
he
might
for
mr
weech
watched
him
keenly
across
the
table
and
indeed
from
some
queer
cause
he
felt
an
odd
impulse
to
cry
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
ever
been
given
anything
kindly
and
ungrudgingly
he
swallowed
the
last
crumb
washed
it
down
with
the
dregs
of
his
cup
and
looked
sheepishly
across
at
mr
weech
down
awright
do
it
that
benefactor
remarked
i
like
to
see
you
enjoyin
of
yerself
i
very
fond
o
you
young
clever
like
you
dicky
had
never
been
called
clever
before
so
far
as
he
could
recollect
and
he
wondered
at
it
now
mr
weech
leaning
back
contemplated
him
smilingly
for
some
seconds
and
then
proceeded
he
said
the
sort
o
boy
as
can
cawfy
and
cake
you
want
it
you
are
dicky
wondered
more
and
his
face
said
as
much
know
mr
weech
pursued
winking
again
grinning
and
nodding
was
a
fine
watch
you
found
the
other
day
to
brought
it
to
me
dicky
was
alarmed
how
did
mr
weech
learn
about
the
watch
perhaps
he
was
a
friend
of
the
funny
old
man
who
lost
it
dicky
half
rose
but
his
affable
patron
leaned
across
and
pushed
him
back
on
the
seat
need
be
frightened
he
said

goin
to
say

nobody
but

perrott
with
a
fixed
grin
toldjer
dicky

to
ask

with
a
great
emphasis
and
a
tapping
of

forefinger

his
grin
widened
his
glance

sidelong
his
forefinger
pointed
from
his
temple
over
dicky
head
and
altogether
he
looked
so
very
knowing
that
dicky
shuffled
in
his
seat
by
what
mysterious
means
was
this
friend
so
well
informed
the
doubt

and

guilty
without

the
least
understanding

offence
but
mr

virtuous
indignation
subsided
as
quickly
as

fist
came
on
the
table
with
a
bang
happen
to
you
somethink
bad
mr
weech
rose
and
was
pleasant
again
though
you
just
go
an
find
somethink
he
said
sharp
about
it
an
do
go
an
git
in
trouble
the
cawfy
a
penny
an
the
cake
a
penny
ought
to
be
twopence
but
say
a
penny
this
time
that
twopence
you
owe
me
an
you
better
bring
somethink
an
pay
it
off
quick
so
go
along
this
was
an
unforeseen
tag
to
the
entertainment
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
dicky
was
in
debt
it
was
a
little
disappointing
to
find
the
coffee
and
cake
no
gift
after
all
though
indeed
it
now
seemed
foolish
to
have
supposed
they
were
for
in
dicky
perrott
world
people
did
not
give
things
away
that
were
the
act
of
a
fool
thus
dicky
with
his
hands
in
his
broken
pockets
and
thought
in
his
small
face
whereon
still
stood
the
muddy
streaks
of
yesterday
tears
trudged
out
of
mr
aaron
weech
and
along
meakin
street
now
he
was
beginning
the
world
seriously
and
must
face
the
fact
truly
the
world
had
been
serious
enough
for
him
hitherto
but
that
he
knew
not
now
he
was
of
an
age
when
most
boys
were
thieving
for
themselves
and
he
owed
money
like
a
man
true
it
was
as
mr
weech
had
said
that
everybody
the
whole
jago
was
on
the
for
himself
plainly
he
must
take
his
share
lest
it
fall
to
others
as
to
the
old
watch
he
had
but
been
beforehand
through
foolish
ingenuousness
he
had
lost
it
and
his
father
had
got
it
who
could
so
much
more
easily
steal
one
for
himself
for
he
was
a
strong
man
and
had
but
to
knock
over
another
man
at
any
nobody
should
hear
of
future
clicks
but
mr
weech
each
for
himself
come
he
must
open
his
eyes
vii
there
was
no
chance
all
along
meakin
street
the
chandlers
and
the
keepers
of
knew
their
neighbourhood
too
well
to
leave
articles
unguarded
soon
dicky
reached
shoreditch
high
street
there
things
were
a
little
more
favourable
there
were
shops
as
he
well
remembered
where
goods
were
sometimes
exhibited
at
the
doors
and
outside
the
windows
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
chance
of
the
sort
as
for
the
people
he
was
too
short
to
try
pockets
and
indeed
the
high
street
rarely
gave
passage
to
a
more
unpromising
lot
moreover
from
robbery
from
the
person
he
knew
he
must
abstain
except
for
such
uncommon
opportunities
as
that
of
the
bishop
watch
for
some
years
yet
he
hung
about
the
doors
and
windows
of
shop
after
shop
hoping
for
a
temporary
absence
of
the
which
might
leave
something
snatchable
but
he
hoped
in
vain
from
most
shops
he
was
driven
away
for
the
shoreditch
trader
is
not
slow
to
judge
the
purpose
of
a
loitering
boy
so
he
passed
nearly
two
hours
when
at
last
he
saw
his
chance
it
came
in
an
advantageous
part
of
high
street
not
far
from
the
though
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
a
had
left
a
perambulator
at
a
shop
door
while
she
bought
inside
and
on
the
perambulator
lay
loose
a
little
skin
rug
from
under
which
a
little
fat
leg
stuck
and
waved
aloft
dicky
set
his
back
to
the
shop
and
sidled
to
within
reach
of
the
perambulator
but
it
chanced
that
at
this
moment
the
stepped
to
the
door
and
she
made
a
snatch
at
his
arm
as
he
lifted
the
rug
this
he
dropped
at
once
and
was
swinging
leisurely
away
for
he
despised
the
chase
of
any
when
a
man
took
him
suddenly
by
the
shoulder
quick
as
a
weasel
dicky
ducked
under
the
man
arm
pulled
his
shoulder
clear
dropped
forward
and
rested
an
instant
on
the
tips
of
his
fingers
to
avoid
the
catch
of
the
other
hand
and
shot
out
into
the
road
the
man
tried
to
follow
but
dicky
ran
under
the
belly
of
a
standing
horse
under
the
head
of
another
that
trotted
across
the
of
a
tramcar
behind
the
driver
back
and
so
over
to
the
he
slouched
into
the
jago
disappointed
as
he
crossed
edge
lane
he
was
surprised
to
perceive
a
stranger
a
toff
indeed
who
walked
slowly
along
looking
up
right
and
left
at
the
grimy
habitations
about
him
he
wore
a
tall
hat
and
his
clothes
were
black
and
of
a
pattern
that
dicky
remembered
to
have
seen
at
the
elevation
mission
they
were
in
fact
the
clothes
of
a
clergyman
for
himself
he
was
tall
and
soundly
built
with
a
certain
square
muscularity
of
face
and
of
age
about
he
had
ventured
into
the
jago
because
the
police
were
in
possession
dicky
thought
and
wondered
in
what
plight
he
would
leave
had
he
come
at
another
time
but
losing
view
of
the
stranger
and
making
his
way
along
old
jago
street
dicky
perceived
that
indeed
the
police
were
gone
and
that
the
jago
was
free
he
climbed
the
broken
stairs
and
pushed
into
the
back
hopeful
though
more
doubtful
of
dinner
there
was
none
his
mother
tied
about
the
neck
with
rags
lay
across
the
bed
nursing
the
damage
of
yesterday
and
commiserating
herself
a
yard
from
her
lay
looey
sick
and
ailing
in
a
new
way
but
disregarded
dicky
moved
to
lift
her
but
at
that
she
cried
the
more
and
he
was
fain
to
let
her
lie
she
rolled
her
head
from
side
to
side
and
raised
her
thin
little
hand
vaguely
toward
it
with
feverishly
working
fingers
dicky
felt
her
head
and
she
screamed
again
there
was
a
lump
at
the
side
a
hard
sharp
lump
got
from
the
stones
of
the
roadway
yesterday
and
there
was
a
curious
quality
a
rather
fearful
quality
in
the
little
wails
uneasily
suggestive
of
the
screams
of
sally
green
victims
father
was
out
prowling
there
was
nothing
eatable
in
the
cupboard
and
there
seemed
nothing
at
home
worth
staying
for
he
took
another
look
at
looey
but
refrained
from
touching
her
and
went
out
the
opposite
door
on
the
landing
was
wide
open
and
he
could
hear
nobody
in
the
room
he
had
never
seen
this
door
open
before
and
now
he
ventured
on
a
peep
for
the
tenants
of
the
front
room
were
strangers
late
arrivals
and
interlopers
their
name
was
roper
roper
was
a
pale
fallen
on
evil
times
and
out
of
work
he
had
a
pale
wife
disliked
because
of
her
clothes
her
exceeding
use
of
soap
and
water
her
aloofness
from
gossip
she
had
a
deadly
pale
baby
also
there
was
a
pale
hunchbacked
boy
of
near
dicky
age
collectively
the
ropers
were
disliked
as
strangers
because
they
furnished
their
own
room
and
in
an
obnoxiously
complete
style
because
roper
did
not
drink
nor
brawl
nor
beat
his
wife
nor
do
anything
all
day
but
look
for
work
because
all
these
things
were
a
matter
of
scandalous
arrogance
impudently
subversive
of
jago
custom
and
precedent
mrs
perrott
was
bad
enough
but
such
people
as
these
dicky
had
never
before
seen
quite
such
a
room
as
this
everything
was
so
clean
the
floor
the
windows
the
also
there
was
a
strip
of
old
carpet
on
the
floor
there
were
two
perfectly
sound
chairs
and
two
pink
glass
vases
on
the
and
a
clock
nobody
was
in
the
room
and
dicky
took
a
step
farther
the
clock
attracted
him
again
it
was
a
small
cheap
cylindrical
thing
of
american
make
and
it
reminded
him
at
once
of
the
bishop
watch
it
was
not
gold
certainly
but
it
was
a
good
deal
bigger
and
it
could
go
it
was
going
dicky
stepped
back
and
glanced
at
the
landing
then
he
darted
into
the
room
whipped
the
clock
under
the
breast
of
the
big
jacket
and
went
for
the
stairs
half
way
down
he
met
the
pale
hunchback
ascending
left
at
home
alone
he
had
been
standing
in
the
front
doorway
he
saw
dicky
haste
saw
also
the
suspicious
bulge
under
his
jacket
and
straightway
seized
dicky
arm
you
bin
he
asked
sharply
in
our
room
what
you
got
there
o
yours
git
out
o
that
dicky
pushed
him
aside
you
do
le
go
i
corpse
ye
but
one
arm
and
hand
was
occupied
with
the
bulge
and
the
other
was
for
the
moment
unequal
to
the
work
of
driving
off
the
assailant
the
two
children
wrangled
and
struggled
downstairs
through
the
doorway
and
into
the
street
the
hunchback
weak
but
infuriate
buffeting
biting
and
whimpering
dicky
infuriate
too
but
alert
for
a
chance
to
break
away
and
run
so
they
scrambled
together
across
the
street
dicky
dragging
away
from
the
house
at
every
step
and
just
at
the
corner
of
luck
row
getting
his
across
the
other
face
he
him
and
the
little
hunchback
fell
heavily
and
lay
breathless
and
sobbing
while
dicky
scampered
through
luck
row
and
round
the
corner
into
meakin
street
mr
weech
was
busier
now
for
there
were
customers
but
dicky
and
his
bulge
he
saw
ere
they
were
well
over
the
threshold
yus
dicky
he
said
coming
to
meet
him
was
expectin
you
come
in
the
by
an
by
we
shall
meet
on
that
beautiful
come
in
and
still
humming
his
hymn
he
led
dicky
into
the
shop
parlour
here
dicky
produced
the
clock
which
mr
weech
surveyed
with
no
great
approval
to
try
an
do
better
than
this
you
know
he
said
it
is
sich
as
it
is
it
about
clears
auf
wot
you
owe
i
reckon
want
some
dinner
this
was
a
fact
and
dicky
admitted
it
the
by
an
come
out
an
set
down
i
bring
you
somethink
this
proved
to
be
a
very
salt
bloater
a
cup
of
the
usual
muddy
coffee
tasting
of
burnt
toast
and
a
bit
of
bread
afterwards
supplemented
by
a
slice
of
cake
this
to
dicky
was
a
banquet
moreover
there
was
the
adult
dignity
of
taking
your
dinner
in
a
which
dicky
supported
indomitably
now
that
he
began
to
feel
at
ease
in
mr
weech
leaning
back
in
his
seat
swinging
his
feet
and
looking
about
at
the
walls
with
the
grocers
almanacks
hanging
thereto
and
the
sunday
school
anniversary
bills
of
past
date
gathered
from
afar
to
signalise
the
elevated
morals
of
the
establishment
queried
mr
weech
in
his
ear
do
about
then
bloater
a
penny
bread
a
cawfy
a
penny
cake
a
penny
you
owe
thrippence
now
viii
when
dicky
perrott
and
the
small
hunchback
were
hauling
and
struggling
across
the
street
old
fisher
came
down
from
the
back
wherein
he
dwelt
with
his
son
bob
bob
wife
and
two
sisters
and
five
children
an
apartment
in
no
way
so
clean
as
the
united
efforts
of
ten
people
might
be
expected
to
have
made
it
old
fisher
on
whose
grimy
face
the
wrinkles
were
deposits
of
mud
stopped
at
the
open
door
on
the
first
floor
and
as
dicky
had
done
he
took
a
peep
perplexed
at
the
monstrous
absence
of
dirt
and
encouraged
by
the
stillness
old
fisher
also
ventured
within
nobody
was
in
charge
and
old
fisher
mentally
pricing
the
pink
glass
vases
at
threepence
made
for
a
small
chest
in
the
corner
of
the
room
and
lifted
the
lid
within
lay
many
of
tools
from
among
which
he
had
that
morning
taken
such
as
he
might
want
on
an
emergent
call
to
work
to
carry
as
he
tramped
curtain
road
clearly
these
were
the
most
valuable
things
in
the
place
and
slipping
a
few
small
articles
into
his
pockets
old
fisher
took
a
good
double
handful
of
the
larger
and
tramped
upstairs
with
them
presently
he
returned
with
bob
missis
and
together
they
started
with
more
as
they
emerged
however
there
on
the
landing
stood
the
little
hunchback
sobbing
and
smearing
his
face
with
his
sleeve
at
sight
of
this
new
pillage
he
burst
into
sharp
wails
standing
impotent
on
the
landing
his
streaming
eyes
following
the
man
and
woman
ascending
before
him
old
fisher
behind
stumped
the
stairs
with
a
clumsy
affectation
of
the
woman
in
front
looked
down
merely
indifferent
scarce
were
they
vanished
above
however
when
the
little
hunchback
heard
his
father
and
mother
on
the
lower
stairs
ix
dicky
came
moodily
back
from
his
dinner
at
mr
weech
plunged
in
mystified
computation
starting
with
a
debt
of
twopence
he
had
paid
mr
weech
an
excellent
clock
a
luxurious
article
in
dicky
eyes
had
eaten
a
bloater
and
had
emerged
from
the
transaction
owing
threepence
halfpenny
of
what
such
a
clock
cost
he
had
no
notion
though
he
felt
it
must
be
some
inconceivable
sum
as
mr
weech
put
it
the
adjustment
of
accounts
would
seem
to
be
quite
correct
but
the
broad
fact
that
all
had
ended
in
increasing
his
debt
by
three
remained
and
perplexed
him
he
remembered
having
seen
such
clocks
in
a
shop
in
norton
folgate
to
ask
the
price
in
person
were
but
to
be
chased
out
of
the
shop
but
they
were
probably
ticketed
and
perhaps
he
might
ask
some
bystander
to
read
the
ticket
this
brought
the
reflection
that
after
all
reading
was
a
useful
accomplishment
on
occasion
though
a
matter
of
too
much
time
and
trouble
to
be
worth
while
dicky
had
never
been
to
school
for
the
elementary
education
act
ran
in
the
jago
no
more
than
any
other
act
of
parliament
there
was
a
board
school
truly
away
out
of
the
jago
bounds
by
the
corner
of
honey
lane
where
children
might
go
free
and
where
some
few
jago
children
did
go
now
and
again
when
boots
were
to
be
given
away
or
when
tickets
were
to
be
had
for
tea
or
soup
or
the
like
but
most
parents
were
of
josh
perrott
opinion
that
was
a
practice
best
never
begun
for
then
the
child
was
never
heard
of
and
there
was
no
chance
of
inquiries
or
such
trouble
not
that
any
such
inquiries
were
common
in
the
jago
or
led
to
anything
meantime
dicky
minded
to
know
if
his
adventure
had
made
any
stir
in
the
house
carried
his
way
deviously
toward
home
working
through
the
parts
beyond
jago
row
he
fetched
round
into
honey
lane
so
coming
at
new
jago
street
from
the
farther
side
choosing
one
of
the
houses
whose
backs
gave
on
jago
court
he
slipped
through
the
passage
and
so
by
the
back
yard
crawled
through
the
broken
fence
into
the
court
left
and
right
were
the
fronts
of
houses
four
a
side
before
him
to
the
right
of
the
narrow
archway
leading
to
old
jago
street
was
the
window
of
his
own
home
he
gained
the
back
yard
quietly
and
at
the
kitchen
door
met
tommy
rann
on
called
tommy
a
barney
they
into
them
noo
roperses
roperses
sez
fisherses
is
sneaked
their
things
they
of
it
from
the
stairs
indeed
came
shouts
and
curses
bumps
and
sobs
and
cries
the
first
landing
and
half
the
stairs
were
full
of
people
men
and
women
ranns
and
learys
together
when
ranns
joined
learys
it
was
an
ill
time
for
them
they
marched
against
and
never
were
they
so
ready
and
so
anxious
to
combine
as
after
a
fight
between
themselves
were
but
some
common
object
of
attack
available
here
it
was
here
were
these
pestilent
outsiders
the
ropers
assailing
the
reputation
of
the
neighbourhood
by
complaining
of
being
robbed
as
though
their
mere
presence
in
the
jago
with
their
furniture
and
their
superiority
were
not
obnoxious
enough
they
must
turn
about
and
call
their
neighbours
thieves
they
had
been
tolerated
too
long
already
they
should
now
be
given
something
for
themselves
and
have
some
of
their
exasperating
respectability
knocked
off
and
if
in
the
confusion
their
portable
articles
of
furniture
and
found
their
way
into
more
deserving
hands
why
serve
them
right
the
requisite
volleys
of
preliminary
abuse
having
been
discharged
more
active
operations
began
under
cover
of
fresh
volleys
dicky
with
tommy
rann
behind
him
struggled
up
the
stairs
among
legs
and
skirts
and
saw
that
the
ropers
the
man
flushed
but
the
woman
paler
than
ever
were
striving
to
shut
their
door
within
the
hunchback
and
the
baby
cried
and
without
those
on
the
landing
skidding
the
door
with
their
feet
pushed
inward
and
now
began
to
strike
and
maul
somebody
seized
the
man
wrist
and
norah
walsh
got
the
woman
by
the
hair
and
dragged
her
head
down
in
a
peep
through
the
scuffle
dicky
saw
her
face
ashen
and
in
the
jamb
of
the
door
and
saw
norah
walsh
red
fist
beat
into
it
twice
then
somebody
came
striding
up
the
stairs
and
dicky
was
pushed
farther
back
over
the
shoulders
of
those
about
him
dicky
saw
a
tall
hat
and
then
the
head
beneath
it
it
was
the
stranger
he
had
seen
in
edge
lane
the
parson
active
and
resolute
norah
walsh
he
took
by
the
shoulder
and
flung
back
among
the
others
and
as
he
turned
on
him
the
man
who
held
roper
wrist
released
it
and
backed
off
is
this
demanded
the
stern
and
hard
of
face
is
all
this
he
bent
his
frown
on
one
and
another
about
him
and
as
he
did
it
some
shrank
uneasily
and
on
the
faces
of
others
fell
the
blank
lack
of
expression
that
was
wont
to
meet
police
inquiries
in
the
jago
dicky
looked
to
see
this
man
beaten
down
kicked
and
stripped
but
a
stranger
was
so
new
a
thing
in
the
jago
this
one
had
dropped
among
them
so
suddenly
and
he
had
withal
so
bold
a
confidence
that
the
jagos
stood
irresolute
a
toff
was
not
a
person
to
be
attacked
without
due
consideration
after
such
a
person
there
were
apt
to
be
inquiries
with
money
to
back
them
and
vengeance
sharp
and
certain
the
thing
indeed
was
commonly
thought
too
risky
and
this
man
so
unflinchingly
confident
must
needs
have
reason
for
it
he
might
have
the
police
at
instant
call
they
might
be
back
in
the
jago
at
the
moment
and
he
flung
them
back
commanded
them
cowed
them
with
his
hard
intelligent
eyes
like
a
tamer
among
beasts
this
now
he
went
on
with
a
sharp
tap
of
his
stick
on
the
floor
is
a
sort
of
thing
i
will
tolerate
in
my
parish
in
this
parish
nor
in
any
other
place
where
i
may
meet
it
go
away
and
try
to
be
ashamed
of
yourselves
go
go
all
of
you
i
say
to
your
own
homes
i
shall
come
there
and
talk
to
you
again
soon
go
along
sam
cash
you
a
broken
head
already
i
see
take
it
away
i
shall
come
and
see
you
too
those
on
the
stairs
had
melted
away
like
punished
most
of
the
others
after
a
moment
of
averted
face
and
muttered
justification
one
to
another
were
dragging
their
feet
each
with
a
pretence
of
sauntering
airily
off
from
some
sight
no
longer
interesting
sam
cash
who
had
already
seen
the
stranger
in
the
street
and
was
thus
perhaps
a
trifle
less
startled
than
the
others
at
his
advent
stood
however
with
some
assumption
of
virtuous
impudence
till
amazed
by
sudden
address
in
his
own
name
whereat
clean
discomfited
he
ignominiously
turned
tail
and
sneaked
downstairs
in
meaner
case
than
the
rest
how
should
this
strange
parson
know
him
and
know
his
name
plainly
he
must
be
connected
with
the
police
he
had
brought
out
the
name
as
pat
as
you
please
so
argued
sam
cash
with
his
fellows
in
the
outer
street
never
recalling
that
jerry
gullen
had
called
aloud
to
him
by
name
when
first
he
observed
the
parson
in
the
street
had
called
to
him
indeed
to
haste
to
the
bashing
of
the
ropers
and
thus
had
first
given
the
stranger
notice
of
the
proceeding
but
it
was
the
way
of
the
jago
that
its
mean
cunning
saw
a
mystery
and
a
terror
where
simple
intelligence
saw
there
was
none
as
the
crowd
began
to
break
up
dicky
pushed
his
own
door
a
little
open
behind
him
and
there
stood
on
his
own
ground
as
the
others
cleared
off
and
the
hunchback
ventured
a
peep
from
behind
his
swooning
mother
that
he
shouted
pointing
at
dicky
begun
it
took
the
clock
dicky
instantly
dropped
behind
his
door
and
shut
it
fast
the
invaders
had
all
gone
the
fishers
had
made
upstairs
in
the
beginning
before
the
parson
turned
and
entered
the
ropers
room
in
five
minutes
he
emerged
and
strode
upstairs
whence
he
returned
after
a
still
shorter
interval
herding
before
him
old
fisher
and
bob
missis
sulky
and
reluctant
carrying
tools
and
thus
it
was
that
the
reverend
henry
sturt
first
addressed
his
parishioners
the
parish
besides
the
jago
comprised
meakin
street
and
some
small
way
beyond
and
it
was
to
this
less
savage
district
that
his
predecessor
had
confined
his
attention
preaching
every
sunday
in
a
stable
in
an
alley
behind
a
disused
shop
and
distributing
loaves
and
sixpences
to
the
old
women
who
attended
regularly
on
that
account
for
to
go
into
the
jago
were
for
him
mere
wasted
effort
and
so
indeed
the
matter
had
been
since
the
parish
came
into
being
x
when
dicky
retreated
from
the
landing
and
shut
the
door
behind
him
he
slipped
the
bolt
a
strong
one
put
there
by
josh
perrott
himself
possibly
as
an
accessory
to
escape
by
the
window
in
some
possible
desperate
pass
for
a
little
he
listened
but
no
sound
hinted
of
attack
from
without
and
he
turned
to
his
mother
josh
perrott
had
been
out
since
early
morning
and
dicky
too
had
done
no
more
than
look
in
for
a
moment
in
search
of
dinner
hannah
perrott
grown
tired
of
self
commiseration
felt
herself
neglected
and
aggrieved
slighted
in
her
state
of
invalid
privilege
so
she
transferred
some
of
her
pity
from
her
sore
neck
to
her
desolate
condition
as
misprized
wife
and
mother
and
the
better
to
feel
it
proceeded
to
martyrise
herself
with
melancholy
pleasure
by
a
nerveless
show
of
to
rights
in
the
room
a
domestic
novelty
perfunctory
as
it
was
looey
still
restless
and
weeping
she
left
on
the
bed
for
being
neglected
herself
it
was
not
her
mood
to
tend
the
baby
she
would
aggravate
the
relish
of
her
sorrows
in
her
own
way
besides
looey
had
been
given
something
to
eat
a
long
time
ago
and
had
not
eaten
it
yet
with
her
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
so
that
now
as
she
dragged
a
rag
along
the
mrs
perrott
greeted
dicky
dicky
comin
jest
when
things
to
rights
and
she
sighed
with
the
weight
of
another
grievance
looey
lay
on
her
back
faintly
and
vainly
struggling
to
turn
her
fearful
little
face
from
the
light
clutched
in
her
little
fist
was
the
unclean
stump
of
bread
she
had
held
for
hours
dicky
plucked
a
soft
piece
and
essayed
to
feed
her
with
it
but
the
dry
little
mouth
rejected
the
morsel
and
the
head
turned
feverishly
from
side
to
side
to
the
sound
of
that
novel
cry
she
was
hot
wherever
dicky
touched
her
and
presently
he
said
i
looey
queer
i
think
she
wants
some
his
mother
shook
her
head
peevishly
you
an
looey
a
noosance
she
said
lot
you
care
about
bein
queer
you
an
yer
father
too
leavin
me
all
alone
like
this
an
me
feelin
ready
to
drop
got
the
room
to
do
an
all
i
wish
you
go
away
an
stop
of
me
like
this
dicky
took
but
another
look
at
looey
and
then
slouched
out
the
landing
was
clear
and
the
ropers
door
was
shut
he
wondered
what
had
become
of
the
stranger
with
the
tall
hat
whether
he
was
in
the
ropers
room
or
not
the
thought
hurried
him
for
he
feared
to
have
that
stranger
asking
him
questions
about
the
clock
he
got
out
into
the
street
thoughtful
he
had
some
compunctions
in
the
matter
of
that
clock
now
not
that
he
could
in
any
reasonable
way
blame
himself
there
the
clock
had
stood
at
his
mercy
and
by
all
jago
custom
and
ethic
it
was
his
if
only
he
could
get
clear
away
with
it
this
he
had
done
and
he
had
no
more
concern
in
the
business
strictly
speaking
nevertheless
since
he
had
seen
the
woman
face
in
the
jamb
of
the
door
he
felt
a
sort
of
pity
for
her
that
she
should
have
lost
her
clock
no
doubt
she
had
enjoyed
its
possession
as
indeed
he
would
have
enjoyed
it
himself
had
he
not
had
to
take
it
instantly
to
mr
weech
and
his
fancy
wandered
off
in
meditation
of
what
he
would
do
with
a
clock
of
his
own
to
begin
with
of
course
he
would
open
it
and
discover
the
secret
of
its
works
and
its
ticking
perhaps
thereby
discovering
how
to
make
a
clock
himself
also
he
would
frequently
wind
it
up
and
he
would
show
the
inside
to
looey
in
confidence
it
would
stand
on
the
and
raise
the
social
position
of
the
family
people
would
come
respectfully
to
ask
the
time
and
he
would
tell
them
with
an
air
yes
certainly
a
clock
must
stand
eminent
among
the
things
he
would
buy
when
he
had
plenty
of
money
he
must
look
out
for
more
clicks
the
one
way
to
riches
as
to
the
ropers
again
bad
it
must
be
indeed
to
be
deprived
suddenly
of
a
clock
after
long
experience
of
the
joys
it
brought
and
norah
walsh
had
punched
the
woman
in
the
face
and
clawed
her
hair
and
the
woman
could
not
fight
dicky
was
sorry
for
her
and
straightway
resolved
to
give
her
another
clock
or
if
not
a
clock
something
that
would
please
her
as
much
he
had
acquired
a
clock
in
the
morning
why
not
another
in
the
afternoon
failing
a
clock
he
would
try
for
something
else
and
the
ropers
should
have
it
the
resolve
gave
dicky
a
virtuous
exaltation
of
spirit
the
reward
of
the
philanthropist
again
he
began
the
prowl
after
likely
plunder
that
was
to
be
his
daily
industry
meakin
street
he
did
not
try
the
chandlers
and
the
held
nothing
that
might
be
counted
a
consolatory
equivalent
for
a
clock
through
the
he
reached
shoreditch
high
street
at
once
and
started
this
time
his
movements
aroused
less
suspicion
in
the
morning
he
had
no
particular
prize
in
view
and
loitered
at
every
shop
waiting
his
chance
at
anything
portable
now
with
a
more
definite
object
he
made
his
promenade
easily
but
without
stopping
or
lounging
by
the
thing
whatsoever
it
might
be
must
be
small
handsome
and
of
an
interesting
character
at
least
as
interesting
as
the
clock
was
it
must
be
small
not
merely
for
facility
of
concealment
and
removal
though
these
were
main
considerations
but
because
stealthy
presentation
were
then
the
easier
it
would
have
pleased
dicky
to
hand
over
his
gift
openly
and
to
bask
in
the
thanks
and
the
consideration
it
would
procure
but
he
had
been
accused
of
stealing
the
clock
and
an
open
gift
would
savour
of
admission
and
whereas
in
that
matter
stark
denial
was
his
plain
course
a
roll
of
print
stuff
would
not
do
apples
would
not
do
and
fish
was
wide
of
his
purpose
up
one
side
and
down
the
other
side
of
high
street
he
walked
his
eyes
instant
for
suggestion
and
opportunity
but
all
in
vain
nobody
exposed
clocks
out
of
doors
and
of
those
within
not
one
but
an
attempt
on
it
were
simple
madness
and
of
the
things
less
desperate
of
access
nothing
was
proper
to
the
occasion
all
were
too
large
too
cheap
or
too
uninteresting
oddly
dicky
feared
failure
more
than
had
he
been
hunting
for
himself
he
tried
farther
south
in
norton
folgate
there
was
a
shop
of
cheap
miscellanies
saddles
razors
straps
dumbbells
pistols
boxing
gloves
trunks
bags
and
many
of
the
things
hung
about
the
in
bunches
and
within
all
was
black
as
in
a
cave
at
one
was
a
pistol
nothing
could
be
more
interesting
than
a
pistol
indeed
it
was
altogether
a
better
possession
than
a
clock
and
it
was
a
small
handy
sort
of
thing
probably
the
ropers
would
be
delighted
with
a
pistol
he
stood
and
regarded
it
with
much
interest
there
were
difficulties
in
the
first
place
it
was
beyond
his
reach
and
in
the
second
it
hung
by
the
on
a
stout
cord
just
then
glancing
within
the
shop
he
perceived
a
pair
of
fiery
eyes
regarding
him
from
the
inner
gloom
and
he
hastily
resumed
his
walk
as
the
jew
reached
the
door
and
watched
him
safely
away
now
he
came
to
bishopsgate
street
and
here
at
last
he
chose
the
gift
it
was
at
a
a
fine
flaming
with
carts
dolls
and
hoops
dangling
above
and
wooden
horses
standing
below
guarding
two
baskets
by
the
door
one
contained
a
mixed
assortment
of
tops
whips
boats
and
woolly
dogs
the
other
was
lavishly
filled
with
shining
round
metal
boxes
nobly
decorated
with
coloured
pictures
each
box
with
a
little
cranked
handle
as
he
looked
a
tune
delightfully
tinkled
on
some
instrument
was
heard
from
within
the
shop
dicky
peeped
there
was
a
lady
with
a
little
girl
at
her
side
who
was
looking
eagerly
at
just
such
a
shining
round
box
in
the
saleswoman
hands
and
it
was
from
that
box
as
the
saleswoman
turned
the
handle
that
the
tune
came
dicky
was
enchanted
this
this
was
the
thing
beyond
debate
a
pretty
little
box
that
would
play
music
whenever
you
turned
a
handle
this
was
a
thing
worth
any
fifty
clocks
indeed
it
was
almost
as
good
as
a
regular
the
first
thing
he
would
buy
if
he
were
rich
there
was
a
in
charge
of
the
goods
outside
the
window
and
his
eyes
were
on
dicky
so
dicky
whistled
absently
and
strolled
carelessly
along
he
swung
behind
a
large
waggon
crossed
the
road
and
sought
a
convenient
doorstep
for
his
mind
was
made
up
and
his
business
was
now
to
sit
down
before
the
and
wait
his
opportunity
a
shop
had
been
boarded
up
after
a
fire
and
from
its
doorstep
one
could
command
a
perfect
view
of
the
across
the
broad
thoroughfare
with
its
crowded
traffic
could
sit
moreover
safe
from
interference
here
he
took
his
seat
secure
from
the
notice
of
the
guardian
whose
attention
was
given
to
passengers
on
his
own
side
the
little
girl
gripping
the
new
toy
in
her
hand
came
out
at
her
mother
side
and
trotted
off
for
a
moment
dicky
reflected
that
the
box
could
be
easily
snatched
but
after
all
the
little
girl
had
but
one
whereas
the
shopwoman
had
many
and
at
best
could
play
on
no
more
than
one
at
a
time
he
resumed
his
watch
of
the
confident
that
sooner
or
later
a
chance
would
come
a
woman
stopped
to
ask
the
price
of
something
and
dicky
had
half
crossed
the
road
ere
the
boy
had
begun
to
answer
but
the
answer
was
short
and
the
boy
attention
was
released
too
soon
at
last
the
shopwoman
called
the
boy
within
and
dicky
darted
across
not
directly
but
so
as
to
arrive
invisibly
at
the
side
next
the
basket
of
music
boxes
a
quick
glance
behind
him
a
snatch
at
the
box
with
the
reddest
picture
and
a
dash
into
the
traffic
did
it
the
dash
would
not
have
been
called
for
but
for
the
sudden
of
the
ere
the
box
had
vanished
amid
the
intricacies
of
jacket
dicky
was
fast
but
the
boy
was
little
slower
and
was
moreover
bigger
and
stronger
on
his
legs
and
dicky
reached
the
other
pavement
and
turned
the
next
corner
into
widegate
street
the
pursuer
scarce
ten
yards
behind
it
was
now
that
he
first
experienced
beef
which
is
the
jago
idiom
denoting
the
plight
of
one
harried
by
the
cry
thief
down
widegate
street
across
sandys
row
and
into
raven
row
he
ran
his
best
clutching
the
hem
of
his
jacket
and
the
music
box
that
lay
within
crossing
sandys
row
a
loafing
lad
shouldered
against
the
and
dicky
was
grateful
for
he
made
it
a
gain
of
several
yards
but
others
had
joined
in
the
hunt
and
dicky
for
the
first
time
began
to
fear
this
was
a
bad
day
twice
already
he
had
been
chased
and
now
it
was
bad
he
thought
little
more
for
a
stunning
fear
fell
upon
him
the
fear
of
the
hunted
that
calculates
nothing
and
is
measured
by
no
apprehension
of
consequences
he
remembered
that
he
must
avoid
spitalfields
market
full
of
men
who
would
stop
him
and
he
knew
that
in
many
places
where
a
man
would
be
befriended
many
would
make
a
virtue
of
stopping
a
boy
to
the
right
along
bell
lane
he
made
an
agonised
burst
of
speed
and
for
a
while
he
saw
not
nor
remembered
anything
heard
no
more
than
dreadful
shouts
drawing
nearer
his
shoulders
felt
only
the
fear
but
he
could
not
last
quick
enough
when
fresh
he
was
tiny
and
ill
fed
and
now
he
felt
his
legs
trembling
and
his
wind
going
something
seemed
to
beat
on
the
back
of
his
head
till
he
wondered
madly
if
it
were
the
with
a
stick
he
turned
corners
and
chose
his
way
by
mere
instinct
staring
how
soon
would
he
give
in
and
drop
a
street
more
half
a
street
ten
yards
rolling
and
tripping
he
turned
one
last
corner
and
almost
fell
against
a
vast
fat
unkempt
woman
whose
clothes
slid
from
her
shoulders
y
are
boy
said
the
woman
and
flung
him
by
the
shoulder
through
the
doorway
before
which
she
stood
he
was
saved
at
his
extremity
for
he
could
never
have
reached
the
street
end
the
woman
who
had
done
it
probably
she
had
boys
of
her
own
on
the
crook
filled
the
entrance
with
her
frowsy
bulk
and
the
chase
straggled
past
dicky
caught
the
for
a
support
and
then
staggered
out
at
the
back
of
the
house
he
gasped
he
panted
things
danced
blue
before
him
but
still
he
clutched
his
jacket
hem
and
the
music
box
lying
within
the
back
door
gave
on
a
court
with
other
doors
two
coster
barrows
and
a
few
dusty
fowls
dicky
sat
on
a
step
where
a
door
was
shut
and
rested
his
head
against
the
frame
the
beating
in
his
head
grew
slower
and
lighter
and
presently
he
could
breathe
with
no
fear
of
choking
he
rose
and
moved
off
still
panting
and
feeble
in
the
legs
the
court
ended
in
an
arched
passage
through
which
he
gained
the
street
beyond
here
he
had
but
to
turn
to
the
left
and
he
was
in
brick
lane
and
thence
all
was
clear
to
the
old
jago
regaining
his
breath
and
his
confidence
as
he
went
he
bethought
him
of
the
jago
row
retreat
where
he
might
examine
his
prize
at
leisure
embowered
amid
trucks
and
barrows
thither
he
pushed
his
way
and
soon
in
the
shade
of
the
upturned
barrow
he
brought
out
the
music
box
bright
and
shiny
it
had
taken
no
damage
in
the
flight
though
on
his
hands
he
found
scratches
and
on
his
shins
bruises
got
he
knew
not
how
on
the
top
of
the
box
was
the
picture
of
a
rosy
little
boy
in
crimson
presenting
a
scarlet
nosegay
to
a
rosy
little
girl
in
pink
while
a
red
brick
mansion
filled
the
distance
and
solidified
the
composition
the
brilliant
hoop
that
made
the
sides
silver
dicky
was
convinced
was
stamped
in
patterns
and
the
little
brass
handle
was
an
irresistible
temptation
dicky
climbed
a
truck
and
looked
about
him
peeping
from
beside
the
loose
then
seeing
nobody
very
near
he
muffled
the
box
as
well
as
he
could
in
his
jacket
and
turned
the
handle
this
was
indeed
worth
all
the
trouble
does
the
was
the
tune
and
dicky
with
his
head
aside
and
his
ear
on
the
bunch
of
jacket
that
covered
the
box
listened
his
lips
parted
his
eyes
seeking
illimitable
space
he
played
the
tune
through
and
played
it
again
and
then
growing
reckless
played
it
with
the
box
unmuffled
till
he
was
startled
by
a
bang
on
the
fence
from
without
it
was
but
a
passing
boy
with
a
stick
but
dicky
was
sufficiently
disturbed
to
abandon
his
quarters
and
take
his
music
elsewhere
what
he
longed
to
do
was
to
take
it
home
and
play
it
to
looey
but
that
was
out
of
the
question
he
remembered
the
watch
but
there
was
gullen
canary
and
him
dicky
sought
and
found
canary
blinked
solemnly
when
the
resplendent
box
was
flashed
in
his
eyes
and
set
his
ears
back
and
forward
as
muffled
again
in
dicky
jacket
it
tinkled
out
its
tune
tommy
rann
should
not
see
it
lest
he
prevail
over
its
beneficent
dedication
to
the
ropers
truly
as
it
was
dicky
resolution
was
hard
to
abide
by
the
thing
acquired
at
such
a
cost
of
patience
address
hard
flight
and
deadly
fear
was
surely
his
by
right
as
surely
quite
as
the
clock
had
been
and
such
a
thing
he
might
never
touch
again
but
he
put
by
the
temptation
manfully
and
came
out
by
jerry
gullen
front
door
he
would
look
no
more
on
the
music
box
beautiful
as
it
was
he
would
convey
it
to
the
ropers
before
temptation
came
again
it
was
not
easy
to
devise
likely
means
their
door
was
shut
fast
of
course
for
a
little
while
he
favoured
the
plan
of
setting
the
box
against
the
threshold
knocking
and
running
off
but
an
opportunity
might
arise
of
doing
the
thing
in
a
way
to
give
him
some
glimpse
of
the
ropers
delight
an
indulgence
he
felt
entitled
to
so
he
waited
a
little
listened
a
little
and
at
last
came
out
into
the
street
and
loafed
it
was
near
six
and
a
smell
of
bloater
hung
about
jerry
gullen
door
and
window
under
the
raised
sash
jerry
gullen
and
foxy
of
face
smoked
his
pipe
sprawled
his
elbows
and
contemplated
the
world
dicky
with
the
music
box
stowed
out
of
sight
looked
as
blank
of
design
and
as
destitute
of
possession
as
he
could
manage
for
there
were
loafers
near
mother
gapp
loafers
at
the
luck
row
corner
at
every
corner
and
loafers
by
the
all
laggard
of
limb
and
alert
of
eye
he
had
just
seen
a
child
going
with
an
empty
beer
can
thrown
down
robbed
of
his
coppers
and
a
poor
old
top
and
kicked
away
in
helpless
tears
and
the
incident
was
commonplace
enough
or
many
would
have
lacked
whosoever
was
too
young
too
old
or
too
weak
to
fight
for
it
must
keep
what
he
had
well
hidden
in
the
jago
down
the
street
came
billy
leary
big
flushed
and
limping
and
hanging
to
a
smaller
man
by
a
fistful
of
his
coat
on
the
shoulder
dicky
knew
the
small
man
for
a
good
which
watch
stealer
and
judged
he
had
had
a
good
click
the
proceeds
whereof
billy
leary
was
battening
upon
in
beershops
for
billy
leary
rarely
condescended
to
anything
less
honourable
than
bashing
and
had
not
yet
fallen
so
low
as
to
go
about
stealing
for
himself
his
missis
brought
many
to
the
cosh
and
his
chief
necessity
another
drink
he
merely
demanded
of
the
nearest
person
with
the
money
to
buy
it
on
pain
of
bashing
or
he
walked
into
the
nearest
selected
the
fullest
pot
and
spat
in
it
a
ceremony
that
deprived
the
purchaser
of
further
interest
in
the
beer
and
left
it
at
his
own
disposal
there
were
others
both
ranns
and
learys
who
pursued
a
similar
way
of
life
but
billy
leary
was
biggest
among
them
big
men
not
being
common
in
the
jago
and
rarely
came
to
a
difficulty
as
however
he
did
once
come
having
invaded
the
pot
of
a
stranger
who
turned
out
to
be
a
mile
end
pugilist
exploring
shoreditch
it
was
not
well
for
any
jago
who
had
made
a
click
to
have
billy
leary
know
of
it
for
then
the
clicker
was
apt
to
be
sought
out
clung
to
and
sucked
dry
possibly
bashed
as
well
when
nothing
more
was
left
if
billy
leary
were
still
but
sober
enough
for
the
work
dicky
gazed
after
the
man
with
interest
it
was
he
whom
his
father
was
to
fight
in
a
week
or
so
perhaps
in
a
few
days
on
the
first
sunday
indeed
that
leary
should
be
deemed
fit
enough
how
much
of
the
limp
was
due
to
yesterday
disaster
and
how
much
to
beer
dicky
could
not
judge
but
there
seemed
little
reason
to
look
for
a
long
delay
before
the
fight
as
dicky
turned
away
a
man
pushed
a
large
truck
round
the
corner
from
edge
lane
and
on
the
footpath
beside
it
walked
the
parson
calm
as
ever
with
black
clothes
and
tall
hat
whole
and
unsoiled
he
had
made
himself
known
in
the
jago
in
the
course
of
that
afternoon
he
had
traversed
it
from
end
to
end
street
by
street
and
alley
by
alley
his
his
readiness
his
unbending
firmness
abashed
and
perplexed
the
jagos
and
his
appearance
just
as
the
police
had
left
could
but
convince
them
that
he
must
have
some
mysterious
and
potent
connection
with
the
force
he
had
attempted
very
little
in
the
way
of
domiciliary
visiting
being
content
for
the
time
to
see
his
parish
and
speak
here
a
word
and
there
another
with
his
parishioners
an
encounter
with
kiddo
cook
did
as
much
as
anything
toward
securing
him
a
proper
deference
in
his
second
walk
through
old
jago
street
as
he
neared
the
feathers
he
was
aware
of
a
bunch
of
grinning
faces
pressed
against
the
bar
window
and
as
he
came
abreast
forth
stepped
kiddo
cook
from
the
door
impudently
affable
smirking
and
ducking
with
mock
obsequiousness
and
offering
a
quart
pot
jer
find
jerself
sir
he
asked
with
pantomime
cordiality
shockin
these
lower
classes
ai
they
er
yus
disgustin
weally
er
might
i
er
prepose
er
a
little
refreshment
ellow
me
the
parson
grimly
impassive
heard
him
through
took
the
pot
and
instantly
jerking
it
upward
shot
the
beer
a
single
splash
into
kiddo
face
are
things
i
must
teach
you
i
see
my
man
he
said
without
moving
a
muscle
except
to
return
the
pot
kiddo
cook
coughing
drenched
and
confounded
took
the
pot
instinctively
and
backed
to
mother
gapp
door
while
the
bunch
of
faces
at
the
bar
window
tossed
and
rolled
in
a
joyous
ecstasy
the
ghost
whereof
presently
struggled
painfully
among
kiddo
own
dripping
features
as
he
realised
the
completeness
of
his
defeat
and
the
expedience
of
a
patient
grin
the
parson
went
calmly
on
before
this
indeed
when
he
left
the
ropers
room
and
just
after
dicky
had
started
out
he
had
looked
in
at
the
perrotts
quarters
to
speak
about
the
clock
but
plainly
no
clock
was
there
and
mrs
flaccid
indignation
at
the
suggestion
and
her
unmistakable
ignorance
of
the
affair
decided
him
to
carry
the
matter
no
further
at
any
rate
for
the
present
moreover
the
little
hunchback
tale
was
inconclusive
he
had
seen
no
clock
in
dicky
possession
had
but
met
him
on
the
stairs
with
a
bulging
jacket
the
thing
might
be
suspicious
but
the
new
parson
knew
better
than
to
peril
his
influence
by
charging
where
he
could
not
convict
so
he
duly
commiserated
hannah
perrott
troubles
suggested
that
the
baby
seemed
unwell
and
had
better
be
taken
to
a
doctor
and
went
his
way
about
the
jago
now
he
stopped
the
truck
by
dicky
front
door
and
mounted
to
the
ropers
room
for
he
had
seen
that
the
jago
was
no
place
for
them
now
and
had
himself
found
them
a
suitable
room
away
by
dove
lane
and
so
emboldened
by
his
company
the
ropers
came
forth
and
with
the
help
of
the
man
who
had
brought
the
truck
carried
down
the
pieces
of
their
bedstead
a
bundle
of
bedding
the
two
chairs
the
pink
vases
and
the
strip
of
old
carpet
and
piled
them
on
the
truck
with
the
few
more
things
that
were
theirs
dicky
with
his
hand
on
the
music
box
in
the
lining
of
his
jacket
sauntered
up
by
the
tail
of
the
truck
and
waiting
his
chance
plunged
his
gift
under
the
bundle
of
bedding
and
left
it
there
but
the
little
hunchback
sharp
eyes
were
jealously
on
him
and
there
he
squealed
put
in
the
truck
an
took
somethink
lie
answered
dicky
indignant
and
hurt
but
cautiously
backing
off
ai
got
nothink
he
spread
his
hands
and
opened
his
jacket
in
proof
i
got
yer
bloomin
bedstead
he
had
nothing
it
was
plain
in
fact
at
the
tail
of
the
truck
there
was
nothing
he
could
easily
have
moved
at
all
certainly
nothing
he
could
have
concealed
so
the
rest
of
the
little
removal
was
hurried
for
heads
were
now
at
windows
the
loafers
began
to
draw
about
the
truck
and
trouble
might
break
out
at
any
moment
indeed
the
ropers
could
never
have
ventured
from
their
room
but
for
the
general
uneasy
awe
of
the
parson
for
nothing
was
so
dangerous
in
the
jago
as
to
impugn
its
honesty
to
rob
another
was
reasonable
and
legitimate
and
to
avoid
being
robbed
so
far
as
might
be
was
natural
and
proper
but
to
accuse
anybody
of
a
theft
was
unsportsmanlike
a
foul
outrage
a
shameful
abuse
a
thing
unpardonable
you
might
rob
a
man
bash
a
man
even
kill
a
man
but
to
away
his
character
even
when
he
had
none
was
to
draw
down
the
execrations
of
the
whole
jago
while
to
assail
the
pure
fame
of
the
place
to
the
street
a
bad
name
this
was
to
bring
the
jago
howling
and
bashing
about
your
ears
the
truck
moved
off
at
last
amid
murmurings
mutterings
and
grunts
from
the
onlookers
the
man
of
the
truck
pulled
roper
shoved
behind
and
his
wife
with
her
threadbare
decency
and
her
meagre
bruised
face
carried
the
baby
while
the
hunchbacked
boy
went
by
her
side
all
this
under
convoy
of
the
reverend
henry
sturt
a
little
distance
gave
more
confidence
to
a
few
and
when
the
group
had
reached
within
a
score
of
yards
of
edge
lane
there
came
a
hoot
or
two
a
and
other
less
spellable
sounds
expressive
of
contempt
and
defiance
roper
glanced
back
nervously
but
the
rest
held
on
their
way
regardless
then
came
a
brickbat
which
missed
the
woman
by
very
little
and
struck
the
truck
wheel
at
this
the
parson
stopped
and
turned
on
his
heel
and
cocko
harnwell
the
flinger
drove
his
hands
into
his
breeches
pockets
and
affected
an
interest
in
mother
gapp
window
till
perceiving
the
parson
eyes
directed
sternly
upon
him
and
the
stick
rising
to
point
at
him
he
ingloriously
turned
tail
and
scuttled
into
jago
court
and
so
the
ropers
left
the
jago
dove
lane
was
but
a
ahead
when
some
of
the
load
shifted
and
the
truck
was
stopped
to
set
the
matter
right
the
chest
was
pushed
back
and
the
bedding
was
lifted
to
put
against
it
and
so
the
musical
box
came
to
light
roper
picked
it
up
and
held
it
before
the
vicar
eyes
at
that
sir
he
said
witness
i
know
nothing
of
it
wo
you
it
ai
mine
an
i
never
saw
it
before
it
bin
put
in
for
spite
to
put
a
theft
on
us
when
they
come
for
it
you
bear
me
out
sir
wo
you
that
was
the
perrott
boy
as
was
put
up
to
do
that
i
be
bound
when
he
was
behind
the
truck
but
nobody
came
for
dicky
gift
and
in
the
jago
twilight
dicky
vainly
struggled
to
whistle
the
tune
and
to
persuade
himself
that
he
was
not
sorry
that
the
box
was
gone
xi
josh
perrott
reached
home
late
for
tea
but
in
good
humour
he
had
spent
most
of
the
day
at
the
bag
of
nails
dancing
attendance
on
the
high
mobsmen
those
of
the
high
mob
were
the
flourishing
practitioners
in
burglary
the
mag
the
mace
and
the
broads
with
an
outer
fringe
of
such
dippers
such
as
could
dress
well
welshers
and
these
the
grandees
of
rascality
lived
in
places
far
from
the
jago
and
some
drove
in
gigs
and
pony
traps
but
they
found
the
bag
of
nails
a
convenient
and
secluded
exchange
and
house
of
call
and
there
they
met
made
appointments
designed
villainies
and
tossed
for
sovereigns
deeply
reverenced
by
the
admiring
jagos
among
whom
no
ambition
flourished
but
this
to
become
also
of
these
resplendent
ones
it
was
of
these
that
old
beveridge
had
spoken
one
day
to
dicky
in
language
the
child
but
half
understood
the
old
man
sat
on
a
curb
in
view
of
the
bag
of
nails
and
smoked
a
blackened
bit
of
clay
pipe
he
hauled
dicky
to
his
side
and
pointing
with
his
pipe
said
that
man
with
the
furs
dicky
replied
in
the
coat
smokin
a
cigar
yus
the
other
with
the
brimmy
tall
hat
and
the
red
face
and
the
umbrella
are
they
mob
toffs
now
dicky
perrott
you
jago
whelp
look
at
them
look
hard
some
day
if
you
clever
cleverer
than
anyone
in
the
jago
now
if
you
only
scoundrel
enough
and
brazen
enough
and
lucky
enough
one
of
a
thousand
maybe
you
be
like
them
bursting
with
high
living
drunk
when
you
like
red
and
pimply
there
it
is
that
your
aim
in
life
there
your
pattern
learn
to
read
and
write
learn
all
you
can
learn
cunning
spare
nobody
and
stop
at
nothing
and
perhaps
he
waved
his
hand
toward
the
bag
of
nails
the
best
the
world
has
for
you
for
the
jago
got
you
and
that
the
only
way
out
except
gaol
and
the
gallows
so
do
your
devilmost
or
god
help
you
dicky
perrott
though
he
wont
for
the
jago
got
you
old
beveridge
had
eccentric
talk
and
manners
and
the
jago
regarded
him
as
a
trifle
though
anything
but
a
fool
so
that
dicky
troubled
little
to
sift
the
meaning
of
what
he
said
josh
perrott
mission
among
the
high
mob
had
been
to
discover
some
mobsman
who
might
be
disposed
to
back
him
in
the
fight
with
billy
leary
for
though
a
private
feud
was
the
first
cause
of
the
still
business
must
never
be
neglected
and
a
feud
or
anything
else
that
could
produce
money
must
be
made
to
produce
it
and
when
a
fight
of
exceptional
merit
is
placed
before
spectators
it
is
but
fair
that
they
should
pay
for
their
diversion
but
few
high
mobsmen
were
at
the
bag
of
nails
that
day
sunday
was
the
day
of
the
chief
gatherings
of
the
high
mob
sunday
the
so
to
speak
of
the
jago
when
such
rent
as
was
due
weekly
was
paid
most
of
the
jago
rents
were
paid
daily
and
nightly
and
other
accounts
were
settled
or
fought
out
moreover
the
high
mob
were
perhaps
a
trifle
shy
of
the
jago
at
the
time
of
a
faction
fight
and
one
was
but
just
over
and
that
cut
short
at
a
third
of
the
usual
span
of
days
so
that
josh
waited
long
and
touted
vainly
till
a
patron
arrived
who
knew
him
of
old
who
had
employed
him
indeed
as
which
means
a
protector
or
a
bully
as
you
please
to
regard
it
on
a
racecourse
adventure
involving
bodily
risk
on
this
occasion
josh
had
earned
his
wages
with
hard
knocks
given
and
taken
and
his
employer
had
conceived
a
high
and
thankful
opinion
of
his
capacity
wherefore
he
listened
now
to
the
tale
of
the
coming
fight
and
agreed
to
provide
something
in
the
way
of
stakes
and
to
put
something
on
for
josh
himself
looking
for
his
own
profit
to
the
bets
he
might
make
at
favourable
odds
with
his
friends
for
billy
leary
was
notorious
as
being
near
prime
ruffian
of
the
jago
while
josh
reputation
was
neither
so
evil
nor
so
wide
and
so
it
was
settled
and
josh
came
pleased
to
his
tea
for
assuredly
billy
leary
would
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
another
notable
of
the
high
mob
to
cover
the
stakes
dicky
was
at
home
sitting
by
looey
on
the
bed
and
when
he
called
his
father
it
seemed
pretty
plain
to
josh
that
the
baby
was
out
of
sorts
rum
about
the
eyes
he
said
to
his
wife
if
she
look
as
though
she
was
goin
to
squint
josh
was
never
particularly
solicitous
as
to
the
children
but
he
saw
that
they
were
fed
and
clothed
perhaps
by
mere
force
of
the
habit
of
his
more
reputable
days
of
plastering
he
had
brought
home
tripe
rolled
in
paper
and
stuffed
into
his
coat
pocket
to
make
a
supper
on
the
strength
of
the
day
stroke
of
business
when
this
tripe
was
boiled
he
and
dicky
essayed
to
drive
morsels
into
looey
mouth
and
to
wash
them
down
with
beer
but
to
no
end
but
choking
rejection
whereat
josh
decided
that
she
must
go
to
the
dispensary
in
the
morning
and
in
the
morning
he
took
her
with
dicky
at
his
heels
for
not
only
did
his
wife
still
nurse
her
neck
but
in
truth
she
feared
to
venture
abroad
the
dispensary
was
no
charitable
institution
but
a
shop
so
labelled
in
meakin
street
one
of
half
a
dozen
such
kept
by
a
medical
man
who
lived
away
from
them
and
bothered
himself
as
little
about
them
as
was
consistent
with
banking
the
takings
and
signing
the
a
needy
young
student
whose
sole
qualification
was
cheapness
was
set
to
do
the
business
of
each
place
and
the
uniform
price
for
advice
and
medicine
was
sixpence
but
there
was
a
deal
of
professional
character
in
the
blackened
and
gilt
lettered
front
windows
and
the
sixpences
came
by
hundreds
for
hospital
letters
but
rarely
came
meakin
street
way
such
as
did
were
mostly
in
the
hands
of
tradesmen
who
subscribed
for
the
purpose
of
getting
them
and
gave
them
to
their
best
customers
as
was
proper
and
and
so
the
dispensary
flourished
and
the
needy
young
student
grew
shifty
and
callous
and
no
doubt
there
were
occasional
indeed
cures
of
simple
science
were
not
at
all
impossible
for
there
was
always
a
good
supply
of
two
drugs
in
the
place
turkey
rhubarb
and
sulphuric
acid
both
very
useful
both
very
cheap
and
both
going
very
far
in
varied
preparation
properly
handled
an
ounce
or
two
of
sulphuric
acid
for
instance
costing
something
fractional
dilutes
with
water
into
many
gallons
of
physic
excellent
medicines
they
made
too
and
balanced
each
other
very
well
by
reason
of
their
opposite
effects
but
indeed
they
were
not
all
for
sometimes
there
were
two
or
three
other
drugs
in
hand
interfering
perhaps
troublesomely
with
the
simple
division
of
therapeutics
into
the
two
provinces
of
rhubarb
and
sulphuric
acid
business
was
brisk
at
the
dispensary
several
were
waiting
and
medicine
and
advice
were
going
at
the
rate
of
two
minutes
for
sixpence
case
was
not
so
clear
as
most
of
the
others
she
could
not
describe
its
symptoms
succinctly
as
pain
here
or
tight
feeling
there
she
did
but
lie
heavily
staring
blankly
upward
she
did
not
mind
the
light
now
with
the
little
cast
in
her
eyes
and
repeat
her
odd
little
wail
and
dicky
and
his
father
could
tell
very
little
the
young
student
had
a
passing
thought
that
he
might
have
known
a
trifle
more
of
the
matter
if
he
had
had
time
to
turn
up
ross
on
nerve
and
brain
troubles
were
such
a
proceeding
consistent
with
the
dignity
of
the
dispensary
but
straightway
assigning
the
case
to
the
rhubarb
province
made
up
a
powder
ordered
josh
to
keep
the
baby
quiet
and
pitched
his
sixpence
among
the
others
well
within
the
two
minutes
and
faith
in
the
dispensary
was
strengthened
for
indeed
looey
seemed
a
little
better
after
the
powder
and
she
was
fed
with
spoonfuls
of
a
fluid
bought
at
a
chandler
shop
and
called
milk

mr

and
dicky
went
xiii
ten
days
after
his
first
tour
of
the
old
jago
the
reverend
henry
sturt
first
preached
in
the
parish
church
made
of
a
stable
in
an
alley
behind
meakin
street
but
few
yards
away
though
beyond
sight
and
sound
of
the
jago
there
that
sunday
morning
was
a
morning
of
importance
a
time
of
excitement
for
the
fight
between
billy
leary
and
josh
perrott
was
to
come
off
in
jago
court
the
assurance
that
there
was
money
in
the
thing
was
a
sovereign
liniment
for
billy
leary
bruises
for
they
were
but
bruises
and
he
hastened
to
come
by
that
money
lest
it
melt
by
caprice
of
the
backers
or
the
backers
themselves
fall
at
unlucky
odds
with
the
police
he
made
little
of
josh
perrott
his
hardness
and
known
fighting
power
notwithstanding
for
was
there
not
full
a
stone
and
a
half
between
their
weights
and
had
billy
not
four
or
five
inches
the
better
in
height
and
a
commensurate
advantage
in
reach
and
billy
leary
own
hardness
and
fighting
power
were
well
proved
enough
it
was
past
eleven
the
weekly
rents
for
the
week
forthcoming
had
been
extracted
or
partly
extracted
or
scuffled
over
old
poll
rann
who
had
made
money
in
years
of
and
iniquity
had
made
the
rounds
of
the
six
houses
she
rented
to
turn
out
the
tenants
of
the
night
who
were
disposed
to
linger
many
had
already
stripped
themselves
to
their
rags
at
in
jago
court
and
the
game
still
went
busily
on
in
the
crowded
area
and
in
overflow
groups
in
old
jago
street
and
men
found
themselves
deprived
not
merely
of
the
money
for
that
day
food
and
that
night
lodging
but
even
of
the
last
few
pence
set
by
to
back
a
horse
for
race
a
fight
or
two
went
on
here
and
there
as
usual
and
on
kerbs
and
doorsteps
sat
women
hideous
at
all
ages
filling
the
air
with
the
rhetoric
of
the
jago
presently
down
from
edge
lane
and
the
came
the
high
mobsmen
swaggering
in
check
suits
and
billycocks
gold
chains
and
lumpy
rings
stared
at
envied
and
here
and
there
pointed
out
by
name
or
exploit
as
done
the
sparks
in
from
regent
street
for
nine
centuries
quids
as
done
five
stretch
for
a
snide
bank
bill
an
they
never
found
the
oof
as
maced
the
bookies
in
france
an
shot
the
nark
in
the
boat
and
so
forth
and
the
high
mob
being
come
the
fight
was
due
of
course
a
fight
merely
as
a
fight
was
no
great
matter
of
interest
the
thing
was
too
common
but
there
was
money
on
this
and
again
it
was
no
common
thing
to
find
billy
leary
defied
still
less
to
find
him
challenged
moreover
the
thing
had
a
rann
and
leary
complexion
and
it
arose
out
of
the
battle
of
less
than
a
fortnight
back
so
that
josh
perrott
did
not
lack
for
partisans
though
not
a
rann
believed
he
could
stand
long
before
billy
leary
billy
cause
too
had
lost
some
popularity
because
it
had
been
reported
that
sally
green
in
hospital
had
talked
of
norah
walsh
in
the
matter
of
her
mangled
face
a
scandalous
device
to
overreach
a
piece
of
foul
practice
repugnant
to
all
proper
feeling
more
especially
for
such
a
distinguished
jago
as
sally
green
so
well
able
to
take
care
of
herself
but
all
this
was
nothing
as
affecting
the
odds
they
ruled
at
three
to
one
on
billy
leary
with
few
takers
and
went
to
four
to
one
before
the
fight
began
josh
perrott
had
been
strictly
sober
for
a
full
week
and
the
family
had
lived
better
for
he
had
brought
meat
home
each
day
now
he
sat
indifferently
at
the
window
of
his
room
and
looked
out
at
the
crowd
in
jago
court
till
such
time
as
he
might
be
wanted
he
had
not
been
out
of
the
room
that
morning
he
was
saving
his
energy
for
billy
leary
as
for
dicky
he
had
scarce
slept
for
excitement
for
days
he
had
enjoyed
consideration
among
his
fellows
on
account
of
this
fight
now
he
shook
and
quivered
and
nothing
relieved
his
agitation
but
violent
exertion
so
he
rushed
downstairs
a
hundred
times
to
see
if
the
high
mob
were
coming
and
back
to
report
that
they
were
not
at
last
he
saw
their
overbearing
checks
and
tore
upstairs
face
before
knees
with
they
are
father
they
are
they
comin
down
the
street
father
and
danced
frenzied
about
the
room
and
the
landing
presently
jerry
gullen
and
kiddo
cook
came
as
seconds
to
take
josh
out
and
then
dicky
quieted
a
little
externally
though
he
was
bursting
at
the
chest
and
throat
and
his
chin
jolted
his
teeth
together
uncontrollably
josh
dragged
off
his
spotted
coat
and
waistcoat
and
flung
them
on
the
bed
and
then
was
helped
out
of
his
blue
shirt
he
gave
a
hitch
to
his
tightened
his
belt
and
was
ready
ol
gal
he
said
to
his
wife
with
a
grin
agin
soon
a
bob
or
two
for
ye
added
kiddo
cook
grinning
likewise
hannah
perrott
sat
pale
and
wistful
with
the
baby
on
her
knees
through
the
morning
she
had
sat
so
wretched
and
helpless
sometimes
putting
her
face
in
her
hands
sometimes
breaking
out
hopelessly
josh
do
good
gawd
josh
i
wish
you
would
or
josh
i
wish
i
was
dead
josh
had
fought
before
it
was
true
and
more
than
once
but
then
she
had
learned
of
the
matter
afterward
this
preparation
and
long
waiting
were
another
thing
once
she
had
even
exclaimed
that
she
would
go
with
him
though
she
meant
nothing
now
as
josh
went
out
at
the
door
she
bent
over
looey
and
hid
her
face
again
luck
father
called
dicky
it
though
the
words
would
hardly
pass
his
throat
and
he
struggled
to
believe
that
he
had
no
fear
for
his
father
no
sooner
was
the
door
shut
than
he
rushed
to
the
window
though
josh
could
not
appear
in
jago
court
for
three
or
four
minutes
yet
the
was
broken
and
the
window
had
been
propped
open
with
a
stick
in
his
excitement
dicky
dislodged
the
stick
and
the
sash
came
down
on
his
head
but
he
scarce
felt
the
blow
and
readjusted
the
stick
with
trembling
hands
regardless
of
the
bruise
rising
under
his
hair
goin
to
look
mother
he
asked
up
looey
but
his
mother
would
not
look
as
for
looey
she
looked
at
nothing
she
had
been
taken
to
the
dispensary
once
again
and
now
lay
drowsy
and
dull
with
little
more
movement
than
a
general
shudder
and
a
twitching
of
the
face
at
long
intervals
the
little
face
itself
was
thinner
and
older
than
ever
horribly
still
but
bloodlessly
pale
mrs
perrott
had
begun
to
think
looey
was
ailing
for
something
thought
it
might
be
measles
or
coming
and
complained
that
children
were
a
continual
worry
dicky
hung
head
and
shoulders
out
of
the
window
clinging
to
the
broken
sill
and
scraping
feverishly
at
the
wall
with
his
toes
jago
court
was
fuller
than
ever
the
tossing
went
on
though
now
with
more
haste
that
most
might
be
made
of
the
remaining
time
a
scuffle
still
persisted
in
one
corner
some
stood
to
gaze
at
the
high
mob
who
to
the
number
of
eight
or
ten
stood
in
an
exalted
group
over
against
the
back
fences
of
new
jago
street
but
the
thickest
knot
was
about
cocko
doorstep
whereon
sat
billy
leary
his
head
just
visible
through
the
press
about
him
waiting
to
keep
his
appointment
then
a
close
group
appeared
at
the
archway
and
pushed
into
the
crowd
which
made
way
at
its
touch
the
disturbed
tossers
pocketing
their
coppers
but
the
others
busily
persisting
with
no
more
than
a
glance
aside
between
the
spins
josh
perrott
cropped
head
and
bare
shoulders
marked
the
centre
of
the
group
and
as
it
came
another
group
moved
out
from
cocko
harnwell
doorstep
with
billy
leary
tall
bulk
shining
pink
and
hairy
in
its
midst
in
the
court
mother
called
dicky
scraping
faster
with
his
toes
the
high
mobsmen
moved
up
toward
the
middle
of
the
court
and
some
from
the
two
groups
spread
and
pushed
back
the
crowd
still
half
a
dozen
couples
remote
by
the
walls
tossed
and
tossed
faster
than
ever
moving
this
way
and
that
as
the
crowd
pressed
now
there
was
an
irregular
space
of
bare
cobble
stones
and
house
refuse
five
or
six
yards
across
in
the
middle
of
jago
court
and
all
round
it
the
shouting
crowd
was
packed
tight
those
at
the
back
standing
on
sills
and
hanging
to
fences
every
window
was
a
clump
of
heads
and
women
yelled
savagely
or
cheerily
down
and
across
the
two
groups
were
merged
in
the
press
at
each
side
of
the
space
billy
leary
and
josh
perrott
in
front
of
each
with
his
seconds
then
any
more
they
begin
bawled
a
high
mobsman
turning
about
among
his
fellows
to
one
on
the
big
three
to
one
i
give
fours
four
to
one
on
leary
fourer
one
fourer
one
but
they
shook
their
heads
they
would
wait
a
little
leary
and
perrott
stepped
out
the
last
of
the
tossers
stuffed
away
his
coppers
and
sought
for
a
hold
on
the
fence
mother
cried
dicky
pale
and
staring
elbows
and
legs
till
he
was
like
to
pitch
out
of
window
from
his
mother
there
but
jerked
a
whimpering
sob
which
he
did
not
hear
the
sparring
was
not
long
there
was
little
of
subtlety
in
the
milling
of
the
jago
mostly
no
more
than
a
rough
application
of
the
main
hits
and
guards
with
much
rushing
and
ruffianing
what
there
was
of
condition
in
the
two
men
was
josh
smaller
and
shorter
he
had
a
certain
hard
brownness
of
hide
that
leary
in
his
heavy
opulence
of
flesh
lacked
and
there
was
a
horny
quality
in
his
face
and
hands
that
reminded
the
company
of
his
boast
of
invulnerability
to
anything
milder
than
steel
also
his
breadth
of
chest
was
great
nevertheless
all
odds
seemed
against
him
by
reason
of
billy
leary
size
reach
and
fighting
record
the
men
rushed
together
and
josh
was
forced
back
by
weight
great
fists
left
and
right
shot
into
his
face
with
smacking
reports
but
left
no
mark
on
the
leathery
skin
and
josh
fighting
for
the
body
drove
his
knuckles
into
the
other
ribs
with
a
force
that
jerked
a
thick
grunt
from
billy
lips
at
each
blow
there
was
a
roar
of
shouts
it
father
fa
ther
fa
ther
dicky
screamed
from
the
window
till
his
voice
broke
in
his
throat
and
he
coughed
himself
livid
the
men
were
at
holds
and
swaying
this
way
and
that
over
the
uneven
stones
blood
ran
copiously
from
billy
leary
nose
over
his
mouth
and
chin
and
as
they
turned
dicky
saw
his
father
spit
away
a
tooth
over
leary
shoulder
they
clipped
and
hauled
to
and
fro
each
striving
to
break
the
other
foothold
then
perrott
stumbled
at
a
hole
lost
his
feet
and
went
down
with
leary
on
top
cheers
and
yells
rent
the
air
as
each
man
was
taken
to
his
own
side
by
his
seconds
dicky
let
go
the
sill
and
turned
to
his
mother
wild
of
eye
breathless
with
broken
chatter
on
the
nose
mother
like
that
ribs
is
goin
black
where
father
pasted
was
out
o
breath
fust
there
blood
all
over
face
mother
father
would
chucked
over
if
tumbled
in
a
father
twice
on
the
jore
o
dicky
was
back
again
on
the
sill
kicking
and
shouting
for
time
was
called
and
the
two
men
rushed
again
into
a
tangled
knot
but
the
close
strife
was
short
josh
had
but
closed
to
spoil
his
man
wind
and
leaving
his
head
to
take
care
of
itself
stayed
till
he
had
driven
left
and
right
on
the
mark
and
then
got
back
leary
came
after
him
gasping
and
blowing
already
and
josh
feinted
a
lead
and
avoided
bringing
leary
round
on
his
heel
and
off
again
in
chase
once
more
josh
met
him
drove
at
his
ribs
and
got
away
out
of
reach
leary
wind
was
going
fast
and
his
partisans
howled
savagely
at
josh
perceiving
his
tactics
taunting
him
with
running
away
daring
him
to
stand
and
fight
take
that
four
to
one
called
a
high
mobsman
to
him
who
had
offered
the
odds
in
the
beginning
stand
a
quid
on
perrott
with
me
you
wo
the
other
answered
if
you
like
done
at
evens
a
quid
perrott
stung
at
length
by
the
shouts
from
leary
corner
turned
on
billy
and
met
him
at
full
dash
he
was
himself
puffing
by
this
though
much
less
than
his
adversary
and
at
the
cost
of
a
heavy
blow
which
he
took
on
his
forehead
he
visited
billy
ribs
once
more
both
men
were
grunting
and
gasping
now
and
the
sound
of
blows
was
as
of
the
confused
beating
of
carpets
dicky
who
had
been
afflicted
to
by
his
father
dodging
and
running
which
he
mistook
for
simple
flight
now
broke
into
excited
speech
once
more
on
the
jore
eye
up
it
father
bash
father
landin
hannah
perrott
crept
to
the
window
and
looked
she
saw
the
foul
jago
mob
swaying
and
bellowing
about
the
shifting
edge
of
an
open
patch
in
the
midst
whereof
her
husband
and
billy
leary
bruised
bloody
and
gasping
fought
and
battered
infuriately
and
she
crept
back
to
the
bed
and
bent
her
face
on
looey
unclean
little
frock
till
a
fit
of
tense
shuddering
took
the
child
and
the
mother
looked
up
again
without
the
round
ended
for
a
full
minute
the
men
took
and
gave
knock
for
knock
and
then
leary
wincing
from
another
swung
his
right
desperately
on
perrott
ear
and
knocked
him
over
exulting
shouts
rose
from
the
leary
faction
and
the
blow
struck
heart
still
but
josh
was
up
almost
before
kiddo
cook
reached
him
and
dicky
saw
a
wide
grin
on
his
face
as
he
came
to
his
corner
the
leathery
toughness
of
the
man
and
the
advantage
it
gave
him
now
grew
apparent
he
had
endured
to
the
full
as
much
and
as
hard
punching
as
had
his
foe
even
more
and
harder
once
he
had
fallen
on
the
broken
with
all
leary
weight
on
him
and
once
he
had
been
knocked
down
on
them
but
except
for
the
sweat
that
ran
over
his
face
and
down
his
back
and
for
a
missing
front
tooth
and
the
lip
it
had
cut
he
showed
little
sign
of
the
struggle
while
leary
left
eye
was
a
mere
slit
in
a
black
wen
his
nose
was
a
beaten
mass
which
had
ensanguined
him
and
indeed
josh
from
crown
to
waist
and
his
chest
and
flanks
were
a
mottle
of
bruises
awright
mother
i
see
laughin
and
smashed
nose
all
over
face
up
again
they
sprang
for
the
next
round
perrott
active
and
daring
leary
cautious
and
a
trifle
stiff
josh
rushed
in
and
struck
at
the
tender
ribs
once
more
took
two
blows
callously
on
his
head
and
sent
his
left
at
the
nose
with
a
smack
as
of
a
flail
on
water
with
that
leary
rushed
like
a
bull
and
josh
was
driven
and
battered
back
for
the
moment
without
response
but
he
ducked
and
slipped
away
and
came
again
fresh
and
vicious
and
now
it
was
seen
that
perrott
toughness
of
hand
was
lasting
leary
knuckles
were
raw
cut
and
flayed
and
took
little
good
by
the
shock
when
they
met
the
other
stubborn
muzzle
while
josh
still
flung
in
his
corneous
fists
hard
and
lasting
as
a
bag
of
bullets
but
suddenly
stooping
to
reach
the
mark
once
more
josh
foot
turned
on
a
projecting
stone
and
he
floundered
forward
into
billy
arms
like
a
flash
his
neck
was
clipped
in
the
big
man
left
arm
josh
perrott
was
in
chancery
quick
and
hard
leary
pounded
the
imprisoned
head
while
jerry
gullen
and
kiddo
cook
danced
distracted
and
dismayed
and
the
crowd
whooped
and
yelled
dicky
hung
delirious
over
the
sill
and
shrieked
he
knew
not
what
he
saw
his
father
fighting
hard
at
the
back
and
ribs
with
both
hands
and
leary
hammering
his
face
in
a
way
to
make
pulp
of
an
ordinary
mazzard
then
suddenly
josh
perrott
right
hand
shot
up
from
behind
over
leary
shoulder
and
gripped
him
at
the
chin
slowly
with
tightened
muscles
he
forced
his
man
back
over
his
bent
knee
leary
clinging
and
swaying
but
impotent
to
struggle
then
with
an
extra
wrench
from
josh
up
came
leary
feet
from
the
ground
higher
higher
till
suddenly
josh
flung
him
heavily
over
heels
up
and
dropped
on
him
with
all
his
weight
the
ranns
roared
again
josh
was
up
in
a
moment
sitting
on
kiddo
knee
and
taking
a
drink
from
a
bottle
billy
leary
lay
like
a
man
fallen
from
a
his
seconds
turned
him
on
his
back
and
dragged
him
to
his
corner
there
he
lay
limp
and
senseless
and
there
was
a
cut
at
the
back
of
his
head
the
high
mobsman
who
held
the
watch
waited
for
half
a
minute
and
then
called
josh
perrott
stood
up
but
billy
leary
was
knocked
out
of
knowledge
and
heard
not
he
was
beaten
josh
perrott
was
involved
in
a
howling
dancing
crowd
and
was
pushed
grinning
this
way
and
that
slapped
on
the
back
and
offered
drinks
in
the
outskirts
the
tossers
inveterate
pulled
out
their
pence
and
resumed
their
game
dicky
spun
about
laughing
flushed
and
elated
and
as
soon
as
the
door
was
distinct
to
his
dazzled
sight
he
ran
off
downstairs
his
mother
relieved
and
even
pleased
speculated
as
to
what
money
the
thing
might
bring
she
put
the
baby
on
the
bed
and
looked
from
the
window
josh
in
the
crowd
shouted
and
beckoned
her
pointing
and
tapping
his
bare
shoulder
he
wanted
his
clothes
she
gathered
together
the
shirt
the
coat
and
the
waistcoat
and
hurried
downstairs
looey
could
come
to
no
harm
lying
on
the
bed
for
a
few
minutes
and
indeed
hannah
perrott
felt
that
she
would
be
a
person
of
distinction
in
the
crowd
and
was
not
sorry
to
have
an
excuse
for
going
out
cheers
for
the
missis
sang
out
kiddo
cook
as
she
came
through
the
press
said
a
bob
or
two
for
you
did
i
josh
perrott
indeed
was
rich
a
capitalist
of
five
pounds
for
a
sovereign
a
side
had
been
put
up
and
his
backer
had
put
on
a
sovereign
for
him
at
three
to
one
so
that
now
it
became
him
to
stand
beer
to
many
sympathisers
also
he
felt
that
the
missis
should
have
some
part
in
the
celebration
for
was
it
not
her
injury
that
he
had
avenged
on
sally
green
brother
so
hannah
perrott
pleased
though
timorous
was
hauled
away
with
the
rest
to
mother
gapp
here
she
sat
by
josh
side
for
an
hour
once
or
twice
she
thought
of
looey
but
with
native
inertness
she
let
the
thought
slip
perhaps
dicky
would
be
back
and
at
any
rate
it
was
hard
if
she
must
not
take
half
an
hour
relaxation
once
in
a
way
at
last
came
dicky
urgent
perplexity
in
his
face
looking
in
at
the
door
josh
minded
to
be
generous
all
round
felt
for
a
penny
said
dicky
plucking
at
her
arm
poll
at
nussin
looey
she
told
me
to
tell
you
to
come
at
once
pigeony
poll
what
right
had
she
in
the
room
the
ghost
of
hannah
perrott
respectability
rose
in
resentment
she
supposed
she
must
go
she
arose
mystified
and
went
with
dicky
at
her
skirts
pigeony
poll
sat
by
the
window
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
and
pale
misgiving
in
her
dull
face
i
come
in
mrs
perrott
mum
she
said
with
a
hush
in
her
thick
voice
come
in
i
see
you

out
i
thought
the
baby
be
alone
she
she
a
sort
o
fit
all
stiff
an
blue
in
the
face
and
grindin
little
mouth
she
left
auf
now
but
i
i
dunno
what
to
make
of
she
so
so
hannah
perrott
stared
blankly
and
lifted
the
child
whose
arm
dropped
and
hung
the
wizen
age
had
gone
from
looey
face
and
the
lids
were
down
on
the
strained
eyes
her
pale
lips
lay
eased
of
the
old
pinching
even
parted
in
a
smile
for
she
looked
in
the
face
of
the
angel
that
plays
with
the
dead
children
hannah
perrott
chin
fell
she
said
bemusedly
and
sat
on
the
bed
an
odd
croaking
noise
broke
in
jerks
from
pigeony
poll
as
she
crept
from
the
room
with
her
face
bowed
in
the
bend
of
her
arm
like
a
weeping
schoolboy
dicky
stared
confounded
josh
came
and
gazed
stupidly
with
his
mouth
open
walking
but
at
a
word
from
kiddo
cook
who
came
in
his
tracks
he
snatched
the
little
body
and
clattered
off
to
the
dispensary
to
knock
up
the
young
student
the
rumour
went
in
the
jago
that
josh
perrott
was
in
double
luck
for
here
was
insurance
money
without
a
doubt
but
in
truth
that
was
a
thing
the
perrotts
had
neglected
hannah
perrott
felt
a
listless
relief
josh
felt
nothing
in
particular
except
that
there
was
no
other
thing
to
be
done
and
that
mother
would
be
a
cheerful
place
to
finish
the
day
in
and
keep
up
the
pecker
so
that
eight
that
evening
at
perrotts
witnessed
a
darkening
room
wherein
an
inconsiderable
little

xiv
on
an
autumn
day
four
years
after
his
first
coming
to
the
jago
the
reverend
henry
sturt
left
a
solicitor
office
in
cheapside
and
walked
eastward
with
something
more
of
hope
and
triumph
in
him
than
he
had
felt
since
the
jago
fell
to
his
charge
for
the
ground
was
bought
whereon
should
be
built
a
church
and
buildings
accessory
and
he
felt
not
that
he
was
like
to
see
any
great
result
from
his
struggle
but
that
perhaps
he
might
pursue
it
better
armed
and
with
less
of
grim
despair
than
had
been
his
portion
hitherto
it
had
taken
him
four
years
to
gather
the
money
for
the
site
and
some
of
it
he
was
paying
from
his
own
pocket
he
was
unmarried
and
had
therefore
no
reason
to
save
still
he
must
be
careful
for
the
sake
of
the
parish
the
church
must
be
built
and
some
of
the
money
would
probably
be
wanted
for
that
moreover
there
were
other
calls
the
benefice
brought
a
trifle
less
than
a
year
and
out
of
that
so
far
as
it
would
go
he
paid
with
some
small
outside
help
for
rent
of
the
temporary
church
and
the
adjacent
rooms
the
organist
salary
the
rates
and
the
the
cost
of
cleaning
care
and
repair
the
sums
needed
for
such
relief
as
was
impossible
to
be
withheld
and
a
thousand
small
things
beside
while
the
jagos
speculated
wildly
among
themselves
as
to
the
vast
sums
he
must
make
by
his
job
for
what
toff
would
come
and
live
in
the
jago
except
for
a
consideration
of
solid
gain
what
other
possible
motive
could
there
be
indeed
still
he
had
an
influence
among
them
such
as
they
had
never
known
before
for
one
thing
they
feared
in
him
what
they
took
for
a
sort
of
supernatural
insight
the
mean
cunning
of
the
jago
subtle
as
it
was
and
baffling
to
most
strangers
foundered
miserably
before
his
relentless
intelligence
and
crafty
rogues
as
broad
street
as
their
proverb
went
at
first
sulked
faltered
and
prevaricated
transparently
but
soon
gave
up
all
hope
or
effort
to
deceive
him
thus
he
was
respected
once
he
had
made
it
plain
that
he
was
no
common
in
the
matter
of
gratuities
to
be
bamboozled
for
shillings
cajoled
for
coals
and
bullied
for
blankets
then
there
became
apparent
in
him
qualities
of
charity
and
lovingkindness
and
governed
that
awoke
in
places
a
regard
that
was
in
a
way
akin
to
affection
and
the
familiar
habit
of
the
jago
slowly
grew
to
call
him
father
sturt
father
sturt
was
not
to
be
overreached
that
was
the
axiom
gloomily
accepted
by
all
in
the
jago
who
lived
by
what
they
accounted
their
wits
you
could
not
juggle
shillings
and
clothing
convertible
into
shillings
out
of
father
sturt
by
the
easy
of
repentance
and
salvation
that
served
with
so
many
there
were
many
of
the
jagos
mightily
despised
by
some
of
the
sturdier
ruffians
who
sallied
forth
from
time
to
time
into
neighbouring
regions
in
pursuit
of
the
profitable
sentimentalist
discovering
him
earnest
green
sometimes
a
preacher
sometimes
a
layman
sometimes
one
having
authority
on
the
committee
of
a
charitable
institution
dabbling
in
the
east
end
on
his
own
account
or
administering
relief
for
a
mission
or
disbursing
a
mansion
house
fund
he
was
of
two
chief
kinds
the
the
of
wool
as
the
jago
word
went
for
whom
any
tale
was
good
enough
delivered
with
the
proper
wistful
misery
and
the
confident
in
a
blind
experience
who
was
quite
as
easy
to
tap
when
approached
with
a
becoming
circumspection
a
rough
and
ready
method
which
served
well
in
most
cases
with
both
sorts
was
a
profession
of
sudden
religious
awakening
for
this
one
offered
an
aspect
either
of
serene
happiness
or
of
maniacal
exaltation
according
to
the
taste
a
better
way
but
one
demanding
greater
subtlety
was
the
assumption
of
the
part
of
earnest
inquirer
hesitating
on
the
brink
of
salvation
for
the
attitude
was
capable
of
indefinite
prolongation
and
was
ever
productive
of
the
boots
the
coats
and
the
used
to
coax
weak
brethren
into
the
fold
but
with
father
sturt
such
trouble
was
worse
than
useless
it
was
indeed
but
to
invite
a
humiliating
snub
thus
when
fluffy
pike
first
came
to
father
sturt
with
the
intelligence
that
he
had
at
last
found
grace
the
father
sturt
asked
if
he
had
found
it
in
a
certain
hamper
a
hamper
hooked
that
morning
from
a
railway
van
and
if
it
were
of
a
quality
likely
to
inspire
an
act
of
restoration
to
the
goods
office
nothing
was
to
be
done
with
a
man
of
this
disgustingly
practical
turn
of
mind
and
the
jagos
soon
ceased
from
trying
father
sturt
had
made
more
of
the
stable
than
the
church
he
had
found
he
had
organised
a
club
in
a
stable
adjoining
and
he
lived
in
the
rooms
over
the
shop
in
the
club
he
gathered
the
men
of
the
jago
indiscriminately
with
the
sole
condition
of
good
behaviour
on
the
premises
and
there
they
smoked
jumped
swung
on
horizontal
bars
boxed
played
at
cards
and
bagatelle
free
from
interference
save
when
interference
became
necessary
for
the
women
there
were
and
singing
and
all
governed
with
an
invisible
discipline
which
being
brought
to
action
was
found
to
be
of
iron
now
there
was
ground
on
which
might
be
built
a
worthier
church
and
father
sturt
had
in
mind
a
church
which
should
have
by
its
side
a
cleanly
a
a
club
baths
and
washhouses
and
at
a
stroke
he
would
establish
this
habitation
and
wipe
out
the
blackest
spot
in
the
jago
for
the
new
site
comprised
the
whole
of
jago
court
and
the
houses
that
masked
it
in
old
jago
street
this
was
a
dream
of
the
future
perhaps
of
the
immediate
future
if
a
certain
new
millionaire
could
only
be
interested
in
the
undertaking
but
of
the
future
certainly
the
money
for
the
site
alone
had
been
hard
enough
to
gather
in
the
first
place
the
east
london
elevation
mission
and
pansophical
institute
was
asking
very
diligently
for
funds
and
was
getting
them
it
was
to
that
indeed
that
people
turned
by
habit
when
minded
to
invest
in
the
amelioration
of
the
east
end
then
about
this
time
there
had
arisen
a
sudden
quacksalver
a
panjandrum
of
philanthropy
a
mummer
of
the
who
undertook
for
a
fixed
sum
to
abolish
poverty
and
sin
together
and
many
pleased
with
the
new
gaudery
poured
out
before
him
the
money
that
had
gone
to
maintain
hospitals
and
to
feed
proved
charities
so
that
gifts
were
scarce
and
hard
to
come
by
indeed
were
apt
to
be
thought
unnecessary
for
was
not
misery
to
be
destroyed
out
of
hand
moreover
father
sturt
wanted
not
for
enemies
among
the
he
was
callous
and
cynical
in
face
of
the
succulent
penitence
of
fluffy
pike
and
his
kind
he
preferred
the
frank
rogue
before
the
calculating
snivelmonger
he
had
a
club
at
which
boxing
was
allowed
and
dominoes
flat
ungodliness
he
shook
hands
familiarly
every
day
with
the
lowest
characters
his
tastes
were
vulgar
and
brutal
and
the
company
at
his
club
was
really
dreadful
these
things
the
cocksure
said
with
shaking
of
heads
and
these
they
took
care
should
be
known
among
such
as
might
give
father
sturt
money
father
sturt
the
name
itself
was
sheer
papistry
and
many
comforted
themselves
by
writing
him
anonymous
letters
displaying
hell
before
his
eyes
and
dealing
him
vivid
damnation
so
father
sturt
tramped
back
to
the
jago
and
to
the
strain
and
struggle
that
ceased
not
for
one
moment
of
his
life
though
it
left
never
a
mark
of
success
behind
it
for
the
jago
was
much
as
ever
were
the
lump
once
leavened
by
the
advent
of
any
denizen
a
little
less
base
than
the
rest
were
a
native
once
ridiculed
and
persuaded
into
a
spell
of
work
and
clean
living
then
must
father
sturt
hasten
to
drive
him
from
the
jago
ere
its
influence
suck
him
under
for
ever
leaving
for
his
own
community
none
but
the
entirely
vicious
and
among
these
he
spent
his
life
preaching
little
in
the
common
sense
for
that
were
but
idle
vanity
in
this
place
but
working
alleviating
growing
into
the
jago
life
flinging
scorn
and
ridicule
on
evil
things
grateful
for
tiny
negative
successes
for
keeping
a
few
from
but
for
an
hour
conscious
that
wherever
he
was
not
iniquity
flourished
unreproved
and
oppressed
by
the
remembrance
that
albeit
the
jago
ruled
full
four
times
that
of
all
london
beyond
still
the
jago
rats
bred
and
bred
their
kind
unhindered
multiplying
apace
and
infecting
the
world
in
luck
row
he
came
on
josh
perrott
making
for
home
with
something
under
the
skirt
of
his
coat
d
do
josh
said
father
sturt
clapping
a
hand
on
josh
shoulder
and
offering
it
as
josh
turned
about
josh
with
a
shifting
of
the
object
under
his
coat
hastened
to
tap
his
with
his
forefinger
before
shaking
hands
he
grinned
broadly
and
looked
this
way
and
that
with
mingled
gratification
and
embarrassment
as
was
the
jago
way
in
such
circumstances
because
one
could
never
tell
whether
father
sturt
would
exchange
a
mere
friendly
sentence
or
two
or
with
concealed
knowledge
put
some
disastrous
question
about
a
watch
or
a
purse
or
a
or
what
not
well
thanks
father
answered
josh
and
grinned
amiably
at
the
wall
beyond
the
vicar
elbow
what
have
you
been
doing
just
lately
odd
jobs
father
always
the
same
answer
all
over
the
jago
quite
such
odd
jobs
as
usual
i
hope
josh
eh
father
sturt
smiled
and
twitched
josh
playfully
by
the
as
one
might
treat
a
child
once
heard
of
a
very
odd
job
in
the
kingsland
road
that
got
a
fine
young
man
six
months
holiday
eh
josh
josh
perrott
wriggled
and
grinned
sheepishly
tried
to
frown
failed
and
grinned
again
he
had
only
been
out
a
few
weeks
from
that
six
moon
presently
he
said
father
you
do
rub
it
into
a
bloke
no
mistake
the
grin
persisted
as
he
looked
first
at
the
wall
then
at
the
pavement
then
down
the
street
but
never
in
the
parson
face
there
a
deal
of
good
in
a
blister
sometimes
is
there
josh
what
that
i
see
a
clock
not
another
odd
job
eh
it
was
indeed
a
small
american
clock
which
josh
had
under
his
coat
and
which
he
now
partly
uncovered
with
positive
protests
me
father
it
all
straight
all
fair
trade
father
jist
a
swop
for
somethink
else
on
me
solemn
davy
that
wot
it
is
father
straight
i
glad
you
thought
to
get
it
josh
father
sturt
pursued
still
twitching
the
never
have
been
a
punctual
churchgoer
you
know
josh
and
i
glad
you
made
arrangements
to
improve
you
have
no
excuse
now
you
know
and
i
shall
expect
you
on
sunday
morning
promptly
do
forget
i
shall
be
looking
for
you
and
father
sturt
shook
hands
again
and
passed
on
leaving
josh
perrott
still
grinning
dubiously
and
striving
to
assimilate
the
invitation
to
church
the
clock
was
indeed
an
exchange
though
not
altogether
an
innocent
one
the
facts
being
these
early
that
morning
josh
had
found
himself
scrambling
hastily
along
a
turning
out
of
brick
lane
accompanied
by
a
parcel
of
nine
or
ten
pounds
of
tobacco
and
extremely
conscious
of
the
hasty
scrambling
of
several
other
people
round
the
corner
some
of
these
people
turned
that
corner
before
josh
reached
the
next
so
that
his
course
was
observed
and
it
became
politic
to
get
rid
of
his
parcel
before
a
possible
in
meakin
street
there
was
one
place
where
this
might
be
done
and
that
was
at
weech
a
muddy
yard
one
of
a
tangle
of
such
places
behind
meakin
street
abutted
on
and
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
a
jago
on
the
crook
hard
pressed
to
pitch
his
plunder
over
the
fence
double
out
into
the
crowd
and
call
on
mr
aaron
weech
for
the
as
soon
as
opportunity
served
the
manoeuvre
was
a
simple
one
facilitated
by
the
plan
of
the
courts
but
it
was
only
adopted
in
extreme
cases
because
mr
aaron
weech
was
at
best
but
a
mean
paymaster
and
with
so
much
of
the
upper
hand
in
the
bargain
as
these
circumstances
conferred
was
apt
to
be
meaner
than
ever
but
this
case
seemed
to
call
for
the
stratagem
and
josh
made
for
the
muddy
yard
dropped
the
parcel
over
the
fence
with
a
loud
whistle
and
backed
off
by
the
side
passage
in
the
regular
way
when
he
called
on
mr
aaron
weech
a
few
hours
later
that
talented
tradesman
with
liberal
gestures
told
out
shillings
singly
in
his
hand
pausing
after
each
as
though
that
were
the
last
but
josh
held
his
hand
persistently
open
till
mr
weech
having
released
the
fifth
shilling
stopped
altogether
scandalised
at
such
rapacity
but
still
josh
was
not
satisfied
and
as
he
was
not
quite
so
easy
a
customer
to
manage
as
the
boys
who
commonly
fenced
at
the
shop
mr
weech
compromised
in
the
end
by
throwing
in
a
cheap
clock
it
had
been
in
hand
for
a
long
time
and
josh
was
fain
to
take
it
since
he
could
get
no
more
and
thus
it
was
that
dicky
coming
in
at
about
five
was
astonished
to
see
on
the
amid
the
greasy
ruins
of
many
candle
ends
the
clock
that
had
belonged
to
the
ropers
four
years
before
xv
as
for
dicky
he
went
to
school
that
is
to
say
he
turned
up
now
and
again
at
irregular
intervals
at
the
board
school
just
over
the
jago
border
in
honey
lane
when
anything
was
given
away
he
attended
as
a
matter
of
course
but
he
went
now
and
again
without
such
inducement
perhaps
because
he
fancied
an
afternoon
change
perhaps
because
the
weather
was
cold
and
the
school
was
warm
he
was
classed
as
a
an
arrangement
which
variegated
the
register
but
otherwise
did
not
matter
other
boys
or
not
attended
as
little
as
he
it
was
long
since
the
managers
had
realised
the
futility
of
attempting
compulsion
in
the
jago
dicky
was
no
fool
and
he
had
picked
up
some
sort
of
reading
and
writing
as
he
went
along
moreover
he
had
grown
an
expert
thief
and
had
taken
six
strokes
of
a
by
order
of
a
magistrate
as
yet
he
rarely
attempted
a
pocket
being
for
most
opportunities
too
small
but
he
was
comforted
by
the
reflection
that
probably
he
would
never
get
really
tall
and
thus
grow
out
of
when
he
was
fully
experienced
as
was
the
fate
of
some
for
no
tall
man
can
be
a
successful
pickpocket
because
he
must
bend
to
his
work
and
so
advertise
it
to
every
beholder
meantime
dicky
practised
that
petty
larceny
which
is
possible
in
every
street
in
london
and
at
odd
times
he
would
play
the
scout
among
the
practitioners
of
the
industry
if
one
crossed
meakin
street
by
way
of
luck
row
and
kept
his
way
among
the
courts
ahead
he
presently
reached
the
main
bethnal
green
road
at
the
end
whereof
stood
the
great
goods
depot
of
a
railway
company
here
carts
and
vans
went
to
and
fro
all
day
laden
with
goods
from
the
depot
and
certain
gangs
among
the
jagos
preyed
on
these
continually
a
scout
stood
on
the
for
such
vehicles
as
went
with
unguarded
tailboards
at
the
approach
of
one
such
he
sent
the
shout
up
luck
row
and
quick
at
the
signal
a
gang
scuttled
down
by
the
court
or
passage
which
his
waved
hand
might
hint
at
seized
whatever
could
be
snatched
from
the
cart
and
melted
away
into
the
courts
sometimes
leaving
a
few
hands
behind
to
hinder
and
misdirect
pursuit
taking
one
capture
with
another
the
thing
paid
very
well
and
besides
there
were
many
vans
laden
with
parcels
of
tobacco
not
from
the
railway
depot
but
from
the
tobacco
factories
hard
by
a
click
from
which
was
apt
to
prove
especially
lucrative
dicky
was
a
notable
success
as
scout
the
department
was
a
fairly
safe
one
but
it
was
not
always
easy
to
extract
from
the
gang
the
few
coppers
that
were
regarded
as
sufficient
share
for
service
done
moreover
mr
weech
was
not
pleased
for
by
now
dicky
was
near
to
being
his
most
remunerative
client
and
the
cart
robberies
counted
nothing
for
the
fat
boys
fenced
their
swag
with
a
publican
at
hoxton
and
though
dicky
had
grown
out
of
his
childish
belief
that
mr
weech
could
hear
a
mile
away
and
see
through
a
wall
he
had
a
cautious
dread
of
the
weapon
he
supposed
to
lie
ever
to
his
patron
hand
betrayal
to
the
police
in
other
respects
things
were
easier
his
father
took
no
heed
of
what
he
did
and
even
his
mother
had
so
far
accepted
destiny
as
to
ask
if
he
had
a
copper
or
two
when
there
was
a
scarcity
indeed
hannah
perrott
filled
her
place
in
the
jago
better
than
of
old
she
would
gossip
she
drew
no
very
rigid
line
as
to
her
acquaintance
and
dicky
had
seen
her
drunk
still
for
old
jago
street
she
was
a
quiet
woman
and
she
never
brawled
nor
fought
of
fighting
indeed
josh
could
do
enough
for
the
whole
family
once
again
four
in
number
for
the
place
of
looey
forgotten
was
supplied
by
em
aged
two
when
dicky
came
home
and
recognised
the
clock
on
the
being
the
more
certain
because
his
mother
told
him
it
had
come
from
weech
the
thing
irritated
him
strangely
through
all
those
four
years
since
he
had
carried
that
clock
to
mr
weech
he
had
never
got
rid
of
the
wretched
hunchback
he
too
went
to
the
board
school
in
honey
lane
it
lay
between
dove
lane
and
the
jago
but
he
went
regularly
worked
hard
and
was
a
favourite
with
teachers
so
far
dicky
was
unconcerned
but
scarce
an
ill
chance
came
to
him
but
sooner
or
later
he
found
the
hunchback
at
the
back
of
it
if
ever
a
teacher
mysteriously
found
out
that
it
was
dicky
who
had
drawn
his
portrait
all
nose
and
teeth
on
the
blackboard
the
tale
had
come
from
bobby
roper
whenever
dicky
chancing
upon
school
by
ill
luck
on
an
afternoon
when
sums
were
to
be
done
essayed
to
copy
answers
from
his
neighbour
slate
up
shot
the
hunchback
hand
in
an
instant
the
tale
was
told
and
handers
were
dicky
portion
once
dinnerless
and
hungry
he
had
stolen
a
sandwich
from
a
teacher
desk
and
though
he
had
thought
himself
alone
and
unseen
the
hunchback
knew
it
and
pointed
him
out
white
malice
in
his
thin
face
and
eager
hate
in
his
thrust
finger
for
a
fortnight
dicky
dared
not
pass
a
little
fruit
shop
in
meakin
street
because
of
an
attempt
on
an
orange
betrayed
by
his
misshapen
schoolfellow
which
brought
him
a
hard
chase
from
the
fruiterer
and
a
bad
bruise
on
the
spine
from
a
board
flung
after
him
the
hunchback
whole
energies
even
his
whole
time
seemed
to
be
devoted
to
watching
him
dicky
on
his
part
received
no
injuries
meekly
in
the
beginning
he
had
tried
threats
and
public
jeers
at
his
enemy
infirmity
then
on
some
especially
exasperating
occasion
he
pounded
bobby
roper
savagely
about
the
head
and
capsized
him
into
a
but
bodily
reprisal
though
he
erected
it
into
a
practice
proved
no
deterrent
for
the
little
hunchback
though
he
might
cry
at
the
pummelling
retorted
with
worse
revenge
of
his
own
sort
and
once
or
twice
bystanders
seeing
a
deformed
child
thus
treated
interfered
with
clouts
on
dicky
ears
the
victim
moreover
designed
another
retaliation
he
would
go
to
some
bigger
boy
with
a
tale
that
dicky
had
spoken
vauntingly
of
fighting
him
and
beating
him
hollow
with
one
hand
this
brought
the
big
boy
after
dicky
at
once
with
a
hiding
except
on
some
rare
occasion
when
the
hunchback
rated
his
instrument
of
vengeance
too
high
and
dicky
was
able
to
beat
him
in
truth
but
this
was
a
very
uncommon
mistake
and
after
this
dicky
did
not
wait
for
specific
provocation
he
bobby
roper
or
rolled
him
in
the
gutter
as
a
matter
of
principle
whenever
he
could
get
hold
of
him
that
afternoon
dicky
had
suffered
again
two
days
earlier
tea
and
cake
had
been
provided
by
a
benevolent
manager
for
all
who
attended
the
school
consequently
the
attendance
was
excellent
and
included
dicky
but
his
attempt
to
secrete
a
pocketful
of
cake
to
carry
home
for
em
was
reported
by
bobby
roper
and
dicky
was
hauled
forth
deprived
of
his
plunder
and
expelled
in
disgrace
he
waited
outside
and
paid
off
the
score
fiercely
by
the
help
of
a
very
long
and
pliant
cabbage
stalk
but
this
afternoon
bill
bates
a
boy
a
head
taller
than
himself
and
two
years
older
had
fallen
on
him
suddenly
in
lincoln
street
and
though
dicky
fought
desperately
and
kicked
with
much
effect
had
dealt
him
a
thrashing
that
left
him
bruised
bleeding
dusty
and
crying
with
rage
and
pain
this
was
the
hunchback
doing
without
a
doubt
dicky
limped
home
but
was
something
comforted
by
an
accident
in
shoreditch
high
street
whereby
a
coster
of
was
knocked
over
by
a
covered
van
and
the
were
scattered
in
the
mud
for
while
the
carman
and
the
coster
flew
at
each
other
name
and
address
and
defamed
each
other
eyes
and
mother
dicky
gathered
a
handful
of
muddy
it
is
true
but
easy
to
wipe
and
so
he
made
for
home
more
cheerfully
disposed
till
the
sight
of
the
ropers
old
clock
brought
the
hunchback
to
mind
once
more
and
in
bitter
anger
he
resolved
to
search
for
him
forthwith
and
pass
on
the
afternoon
hiding
with
interest
as
he
emerged
into
the
street
a
hand
was
reached
to
catch
him
which
he
dodged
by
instinct
he
rushed
back
upstairs
and
emptied
his
pockets
stowing
away
in
a
safe
corner
the
rest
of
the
the
broken
ruin
he
called
his
knife
some
buttons
and
pieces
of
string
a
bit
of
chalk
three
little
pieces
of
slate
pencil
and
two
marbles
then
he
went
down
again
into
the
street
confident
in
his
destitution
and
watched
forgetting
the
hunchback
in
the
excitement
of
the
spectacle
the
loafers
from
the
corners
had
conceived
a
sudden
notion
of
and
had
joined
forces
to
the
array
of
twenty
or
thirty
confident
in
their
numbers
they
swept
the
street
stopping
every
passenger
man
woman
or
child
and
emptying
all
pockets
a
straggler
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
a
hobbledehoy
like
most
of
the
rest
had
snatched
at
but
had
lost
dicky
and
was
now
busy
with
four
or
five
others
rolling
a
woman
a
struggling
heap
of
old
clothes
and
skinny
limbs
in
the
road
it
was
biddy
flynn
too
old
and
worn
for
anything
but
honest
work
who
sold
oranges
and
nuts
from
a
basket
and
who
had
been
caught
on
her
way
out
for
her
evening
trade
in
high
street
she
was
a
fortunate
capture
being
a
lone
woman
with
all
her
possessions
about
her
under
her
skirt
and
tied
round
her
waist
with
string
she
kept
her
and
it
was
soon
found
and
dragged
away
yielding
two
and
eightpence
farthing
and
a
lucky
worn
round
and
bright
she
had
moreover
an
old
brass
brooch
but
unfortunately
her
wedding
ring
worn
to
could
not
be
got
past
the
knotted
knuckle
though
it
would
have
been
worth
little
in
any
case
so
biddy
flynn
exhausted
with
plunging
and
screaming
was
left
and
her
empty
basket
was
flung
at
her
she
staggered
away
wailing
and
rolling
her
head
with
her
hand
to
the
wall
and
the
gang
sharing
out
sucked
oranges
with
relish
and
turned
to
fresh
exploits
dicky
watched
from
the
jago
court
passage
business
slackened
for
a
little
while
and
the
loafers
were
contemplating
a
raid
in
force
on
mother
gapp
till
when
a
grown
lad
ran
in
from
luck
row
with
a
square
parcel
clipped
under
his
arm
a
parcel
of
aspect
well
known
among
the
fat
boys
a
parcel
that
meant
tobacco
he
was
collared
at
once
it
bill
he
cried
breathlessly
recognising
his
captor
bloke
but
hands
were
on
his
plunder
it
was
snatched
away
and
he
was
flung
back
on
the
flags
there
was
a
clatter
on
the
stones
of
luck
row
and
a
light
van
came
rattling
into
old
jago
street
the
horse
galloping
the
carman
lashing
and
shouting
stop
thief
the
sight
was
so
novel
that
for
a
moment
the
gang
merely
stared
and
grinned
this
man
must
be
a
greenhorn
new
to
the
neighbourhood
to
venture
a
load
of
goods
up
luck
row
and
it
was
tobacco
too
he
was
pale
and
flustered
and
he
called
wildly
as
he
looked
this
way
and
that
man
stole
somethin
auf
my
van
where
gawn
good
cried
one
ball
stopped
rollin
you
lawst
gawd
said
the
man
in
a
sweat
done
there
two
quid
worth
o
an
i
got
the
job
o
monday
bin
out
nine
munse
it
a
parcel
like
this
asked
another
chuckling
and
lifting
a
second
packet
over
the
tailboard
put
it
down
gawd
wotcher
up
to
the
gang
were
over
the
van
guffawing
and
flinging
out
the
load
the
carman
yelled
aloud
and
fought
desperately
with
his
whip
bill
hanks
is
near
blind
of
an
eye
now
from
one
cut
but
he
was
the
worse
for
it
for
he
was
knocked
off
the
van
in
a
heap
and
as
he
lay
they
cleared
his
pockets
and
pulled
off
his
boots
those
that
had
caught
the
sting
of
the
whip
kicking
him
about
the
head
till
it
but
shifted
in
the
slime
at
the
stroke
an
inanimate
lump
there
was
talk
of
how
to
deal
with
the
horse
and
van
to
try
to
sell
them
was
too
large
a
job
and
too
risky
so
as
it
was
growing
dusk
the
senseless
carman
was
put
on
the
floor
of
the
van
the
tailboard
was
raised
and
one
of
the
gang
led
the
horse
away
to
lose
the
whole
thing
in
the
busy
streets
here
was
a
big
haul
and
many
of
the
crowd
busied
themselves
in
getting
it
out
of
sight
and
scouting
out
among
the
fences
to
arrange
sales
those
who
remained
grew
less
active
and
hung
at
the
corner
of
luck
row
little
more
than
an
ordinary
of
loafers
then
dicky
remembered
the
hunchback
and
slouched
off
to
dove
lane
but
he
could
see
nothing
of
bobby
roper
the
jago
and
dove
lane
were
districts
ever
at
feud
active
or
smouldering
save
for
brief
intervals
of
ostentatious
reconciliation
serving
to
render
the
next
attack
on
dove
lane
the
more
savage
for
invariably
the
jagos
were
aggressors
and
victors
dicky
was
careful
in
his
lurkings
therefore
lest
he
should
be
recognised
and
set
upon
by
more
dove
lane
boys
than
would
be
convenient
he
knew
where
the
ropers
lived
and
he
went
and
hung
about
the
door
once
he
fancied
he
could
hear
a
disjointed
tinkle
as
of
a
grown
infirm
but
he
was
not
sure
of
it
and
in
the
end
he
contented
himself
for
the
present
with
flinging
a
stone
through
the
window
and
taking
to
his
heels
the
jago
was
black
with
night
the
rats
came
and
went
and
the
lurked
on
landings
on
a
step
pigeony
poll
drunk
because
of
a
little
gin
and
no
food
sang
hideously
and
wept
the
loafers
had
dispersed
to
spend
their
afternoon
makings
the
group
which
dicky
had
left
by
luck
row
corner
indeed
had
been
discouraged
early
in
the
evening
in
consequence
of
an
attempt
at
over
old
beveridge
as
he
unsuspectingly
stalked
among
them
in
from
his
city
round
for
the
old
man
whipped
out
his
and
drove
it
into
the
flesh
of
nobber
sugg
arm
at
the
shoulder
stabbed
too
at
another
and
ripped
his
coat
so
nobber
sugg
with
blood
streaming
through
his
sleeve
went
off
with
two
more
to
tie
up
the
arm
and
old
beveridge
grinning
and
mumbling
fiercely
strode
about
the
street
knife
in
hand
for
ten
minutes
ere
he
grew
calm
enough
to
go
his
way
this
tommy
rann
told
dicky
sitting
in
the
and
smoking
a
pipe
a
pipe
charged
with
tobacco
pillaged
from
a
which
his
father
had
bought
at
about
fourpence
a
pound
from
a
loafer
and
both
boys
crawled
indoors
deadly
sick
xvi
josh
perrott
was
at
church
on
sunday
morning
as
father
sturt
had
bid
him
not
because
of
the
bidding
but
because
the
vicar
overtook
him
and
kiddo
cook
in
meakin
street
and
hauled
them
in
professing
to
be
much
gratified
at
their
punctuality
and
charging
them
never
to
fall
away
from
the
habit
the
two
jagos
with
dubious
grins
submitted
as
they
must
and
were
in
a
little
while
surprised
to
find
others
arriving
friends
and
acquaintances
never
suspected
of
the
fact
was
that
father
sturt
by
dint
of
long
effort
had
so
often
brought
so
many
to
his
as
he
had
now
brought
josh
and
kiddo
that
the
terrors
and
embarrassments
of
the
place
had
worn
off
and
many
finding
nothing
more
attractive
elsewhere
would
make
occasional
attendances
of
their
own
motion
wet
sundays
particularly
inclined
them
to
church
where
there
might
be
a
fire
where
at
least
there
was
a
clean
room
with
pictures
on
the
wall
where
there
were
often
flowers
where
there
was
always
music
and
where
father
sturt
made
an
address
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
which
nobody
ever
suspected
of
being
a
sermon
an
address
which
one
might
doze
over
or
listen
to
as
one
might
be
disposed
but
which
most
listened
to
more
or
less
partly
because
of
an
uneasy
feeling
that
father
sturt
would
know
if
they
did
not
and
partly
because
it
was
very
easy
to
understand
was
not
oppressively
minatory
was
spoken
with
an
intimate
knowledge
of
themselves
and
was
indeed
something
of
a
refreshing
novelty
being
the
simple
talk
of
a
gentleman
josh
perrott
and
kiddo
cook
were
not
altogether
sorry
they
had
come
it
was
a
rest
stable
though
it
had
been
they
had
never
sat
in
so
pleasant
a
room
before
there
was
nothing
to
do
no
constant
watch
to
be
kept
no
police
to
avoid
and
their
wits
had
a
holiday
they
forgot
things
their
courage
never
rose
so
high
as
to
build
the
thought
but
in
truth
pipes
would
have
made
them
happy
the
address
being
done
father
sturt
announced
the
purchase
of
the
site
for
the
new
church
and
briefly
described
his
scheme
he
would
give
tenants
good
notice
he
said
before
the
houses
were
destroyed
meantime
they
must
pay
rent
though
most
of
the
amounts
would
be
reduced
and
after
the
benediction
father
sturt
from
his
window
over
the
closed
shop
saw
josh
perrott
and
kiddo
cook
guffawing
and
elbowing
one
another
up
luck
row
each
was
accusing
the
other
of
having
tried
to
sing
xvii
there
was
much
talk
of
father
sturt
announcement
many
held
it
a
shame
that
so
much
money
destined
for
the
benefit
of
the
jago
should
be
spent
in
bricks
and
mortar
instead
of
being
distributed
among
themselves
they
fell
to
calculating
the
price
of
the
land
and
houses
and
to
working
it
out
laboriously
in
the
denomination
of
pots
and
gallons
more
it
was
felt
to
be
a
grave
social
danger
that
jago
court
should
be
extinguished
what
would
become
of
the
jago
without
jago
court
where
would
sunday
morning
be
spent
where
would
the
fights
come
off
and
where
was
so
convenient
a
place
for
pitch
and
toss
but
mainly
they
feared
the
police
jago
court
was
an
unfailing
sanctuary
a
city
of
refuge
ever
ready
ever
secure
there
were
times
when
two
or
three
of
the
police
hot
in
the
chase
would
burst
into
the
jago
at
the
heels
of
a
flying
marauder
then
the
runaway
would
make
straight
for
the
archway
and
once
he
was
in
jago
court
danger
was
over
for
he
had
only
to
run
into
one
of
the
doors
at
right
or
left
and
out
into
and
other
houses
or
better
to
scramble
over
the
low
fence
opposite
through
the
back
door
before
him
and
so
into
new
jago
street
beyond
the
archway
the
police
could
not
venture
except
in
large
companies
a
young
constable
who
tried
it
once
getting
ahead
of
two
companions
in
his
ardour
was
laid
low
as
he
emerged
from
the
passage
by
a
adroitly
let
drop
from
an
upper
window
the
blotting
out
of
such
a
godsend
of
a
place
as
this
would
be
a
calamity
the
jago
would
never
be
the
same
again
as
it
was
the
old
jago
was
a
very
convenient
comfortable
sort
of
place
they
argued
they
could
not
imagine
themselves
living
anywhere
else
but
assuredly
it
would
be
the
jago
no
longer
without
jago
court
and
this
thing
was
to
be
done
too
with
money
got
together
for
their
benefit
the
sole
explanation
the
jago
could
supply
was
the
one
that
at
last
with
arithmetical
variations
prevailed
the
landlords
were
to
be
paid
a
sum
varying
in
jago
estimation
from
a
hundred
pounds
to
a
hundred
thousand
for
the
houses
and
the
ground
and
of
this
they
were
secretly
to
return
to
father
sturt
a
certain
share
generally
agreed
on
as
half
as
his
private
fee
for
bringing
about
so
desirable
a
transaction
looked
at
from
all
points
this
appeared
to
be
the
most
plausible
explanation
for
no
other
could
reasonably
account
for
father
sturt
activity
no
wonder
he
could
afford
to
reduce
some
of
the
rents
was
he
not
already
receiving
princely
wages
variously
supposed
to
be
something
from
ten
pounds
to
thirty
pounds
a
week
from
the
government
for
preaching
every
sunday
still
the
rents
were
to
be
reduced
that
was
the
immediate
consideration
and
nothing
but
an
immediate
consideration
carried
weight
in
the
jago
where
a
shilling
was
to
be
preferred
to
a
constant
income
beginning
in
a
month
time
the
first
effect
of
the
announcement
was
a
rush
of
applications
for
rooms
in
the
doomed
houses
each
applicant
demanding
to
be
accommodated
by
the
eviction
of
somebody
already
established
but
now
disinterestedly
discovered
to
be
a
bad
tenant
they
were
all
disappointed
but
the
residents
had
better
luck
than
they
had
hoped
for
the
unexpected
happened
and
the
money
for
a
part
of
the
new
buildings
was
suddenly
guaranteed
wherefore
father
sturt
knowing
that
many
would
be
hard
put
to
it
to
find
shelter
when
the
houses
came
down
and
guessing
that
rents
would
rise
with
the
demand
determined
to
ask
none
for
the
little
while
the
tenements
endured
scarce
had
he
made
his
decision
known
ere
he
regretted
it
popular
as
it
was
for
he
reflected
that
the
money
saved
would
merely
melt
and
that
at
the
inevitable
turning
out
not
a
soul
would
be
the
better
off
for
the
relief
but
indeed
might
find
it
harder
than
ever
to
pay
rent
after
the
temporary
easement
it
would
have
been
better
rigidly
to
exact
the
rent
and
return
it
in
lump
to
each
tenant
as
he
left
the
sum
would
have
been
an
inducement
to
leave
peaceably
a
matter
in
which
trouble
was
to
be
expected
but
then
what
did
any
windfall
of
shillings
bring
in
the
jago
what
but
a
drunk
this
was
one
of
father
sturt
thousand
perplexities
and
he
could
but
hope
that
perhaps
he
had
done
right
after
all
the
old
buildings
were
sold
as
they
stood
to
the
and
on
the
devolved
the
work
of
getting
the
lodgers
out
for
weeks
the
day
was
deferred
but
it
drew
very
near
at
last
and
a
tall
hoarding
was
put
up
next
morning
it
had
vanished
but
there
was
a
loud
crackling
where
the
jagos
boiled
their
pots
dicky
perrott
and
tommy
rann
had
a
bonfire
in
edge
lane
and
jerry
gullen
canary
sweated
abroad
before
a
heavy
load
of
cheap
firewood
then
josh
perrott
and
billy
leary
his
old
enemy
were
appointed
joint
guardians
of
the
new
hoarding
each
to
get
on
every
morning
when
the
fence
was
found
intact
and
in
the
end
there
came
eviction
day
and
once
more
the
police
held
the
jago
in
force
escorting
gangs
of
men
with
tumbrils
as
for
the
perrotts
they
could
easily
find
another
room
at
the
high
rent
always
charged
for
the
privilege
of
residence
in
the
jago
to
have
remained
in
one
room
four
or
five
years
and
to
have
paid
rent
with
indifferent
good
regularity
was
a
feat
sufficiently
rare
to
be
notorious
and
to
cause
way
to
be
made
for
them
wherever
a
room
was
falling
vacant
or
could
be
emptied
they
went
no
farther
than
across
the
way
to
a
room
wherein
a
widow
had
died
over
her
two
days
before
and
had
sat
on
the
floor
with
her
head
between
her
knees
for
hours
while
her
children
not
understanding
cried
that
they
were
hungry
these
children
were
now
gone
to
the
workhouse
more
fortunate
than
the
many
they
left
behind
and
the
room
was
a
very
fair
one
ten
feet
square
or
so
the
rest
of
the
tenants
thought
not
at
all
of
new
quarters
and
did
nothing
to
find
them
till
they
found
themselves
and
their
belongings
roofless
in
old
jago
street
then
with
one
accord
they
demanded
lodgings
of
the
vicar
most
of
them
had
never
inhabited
any
rooms
so
long
as
they
had
these
which
they
must
now
leave
having
been
ejected
again
and
again
because
of
unpaid
rent
nevertheless
they
clamoured
for
redress
as
they
might
have
clamoured
had
they
never
changed
dwellings
in
their
lives
nobody
resisted
the
police
for
there
were
too
many
of
them
moreover
father
sturt
was
there
and
few
had
hardihood
for
any
but
their
best
behaviour
in
his
presence
still
there
were
disputes
among
the
jagos
themselves
that
sometimes
came
very
near
to
fights
ginger
missis
professed
to
recognise
a
property
in
a
tin
kettle
brought
into
the
outer
air
among
the
belongings
of
mrs
walsh
the
miscellaneous
rags
and
sticks
that
were
cocko
harnwell
household
goods
got
mingled
in
the
roadway
with
those
appertaining
to
the
fishers
and
their
assortment
without
a
turn
of
family
combat
was
a
task
which
tried
the
vicar
influence
to
the
utmost
mrs
rafferty
too
was
suspected
of
undue
pride
in
a
cranky
deal
and
thereby
of
a
disposition
to
sneer
at
the
humbler
of
the
regans
from
the
next
floor
giving
occasion
for
a
shrill
and
animated
row
the
weather
was
dry
fortunately
and
the
evicted
squatted
in
the
roadway
by
their
heaps
or
on
them
squabbling
and
lamenting
ginger
stagg
having
covered
certain
crockery
with
the
old
family
mattress
forgetfully
sat
on
it
and
came
upon
father
sturt
with
an
indignant
demand
for
compensation
father
sturt
efforts
to
stimulate
a
search
for
new
lodgings
met
with
small
success
at
first
it
was
felt
that
no
doubt
there
were
lodgings
to
be
had
but
they
would
be
open
to
the
fatal
objection
of
costing
something
and
the
jago
temperament
could
neither
endure
nor
understand
payment
for
what
had
once
been
given
for
nothing
father
sturt
the
jagos
argued
had
given
them
free
quarters
for
so
long
then
why
should
he
stop
now
if
they
cleared
out
in
order
to
make
room
for
his
new
church
in
common
fairness
he
should
find
them
similar
lodging
on
the
same
terms
so
they
sat
and
waited
for
him
to
do
it
at
length
the
vicar
set
to
work
with
them
in
good
earnest
carried
away
with
him
a
family
or
two
at
a
time
and
inducted
them
to
rooms
of
his
own
finding
and
hereat
others
learning
that
in
these
cases
rent
in
advance
was
exacted
bestirred
themselves
reflecting
that
if
rent
must
be
paid
they
might
as
well
choose
their
own
rooms
as
take
those
that
father
sturt
might
find
of
course
the
thing
was
not
done
without
payments
from
the
vicar
pocket
some
were
wholly
destitute
others
could
not
muster
enough
to
pay
that
advance
of
rent
which
alone
could
open
a
jago
tenancy
distinguishing
the
genuine
impecuniosity
from
the
merely
professed
with
the
insight
that
was
now
a
sixth
sense
with
him
father
sturt
helped
sparingly
and
in
secret
for
a
precedent
of
almsgiving
was
an
evil
thing
in
the
jago
confirming
the
shiftlessness
which
was
already
a
piece
of
jago
nature
and
setting
up
long
affliction
for
the
almsgiver
enough
of
such
precedents
existed
and
the
inevitable
additions
thereto
were
a
work
of
anxious
responsibility
and
jealous
care
so
the
bivouac
in
old
jago
street
melted
away
for
one
thing
there
were
those
among
the
dispossessed
who
would
not
waste
time
in
unproductive
inactivity
just
then
for
war
had
arisen
with
dove
lane
and
spoils
were
going
dove
lane
was
no
very
reputable
place
but
it
was
not
like
the
jago
in
the
phrase
of
the
district
the
dove
laners
were
pretty
thick
but
the
jagos
were
thick
as
glue
there
were
many
among
the
dove
laners
and
at
this
their
prosperous
season
they
and
their
friends
resorted
to
a
shop
in
meakin
street
kept
by
an
tailor
there
to
buy
the
original
downy
benjamins
or
the
celebrated
kicksies
cut
saucy
with
artful
buttons
and
a
double
fakement
down
the
sides
and
hereabout
they
were
apt
to
be
set
upon
by
jagos
overthrown
by
superior
numbers
bashed
and
cleaned
out
or
if
the
purchases
had
been
made
they
were
flimped
of
their
kicksies
benjies
or
daisies
as
the
case
might
be
so
that
a
fight
with
dove
lane
might
be
an
affair
of
some
occasional
profit
and
it
became
no
loyal
jago
to
idle
in
the
stronghold
father
sturt
task
was
nearly
over
when
returning
to
old
jago
street
he
saw
dicky
perrott
sitting
by
a
heap
a
heap
small
and
poor
even
among
those
others
the
perrotts
had
been
decorously
settled
in
their
new
home
since
early
morning
but
here
was
dicky
guarding
a
heap
with
a
baby
on
it
and
absorbed
in
the
weaving
of
rush
bags
right
dicky
my
boy
said
father
sturt
in
the
approving
voice
that
a
jago
would
do
almost
anything
except
turn
honest
to
hear
and
dicky
startled
looked
up
flushed
and
happy
over
his
shoulder
bags
eh
the
vicar
went
on
stooping
and
handing
dicky
another
rush
from
the
heap
whose
are
they
the
bags
the
rushes
the
heap
and
the
baby
belonged
to
mrs
bates
the
widow
who
was
now
in
search
of
a
new
room
dicky
had
often
watched
the
weaving
of
fishmongers
frails
and
since
it
was
work
in
which
he
had
had
no
opportunity
of
indulging
it
naturally
struck
him
as
a
fascinating
pastime
so
that
he
was
delighted
by
the
chance
which
he
had
taken
and
mrs
bates
for
her
part
was
not
sorry
to
find
somebody
to
mind
her
property
moreover
by
hard
work
and
the
skill
begot
of
much
practice
she
was
able
to
earn
a
sum
of
some
three
farthings
an
hour
at
the
rush
bags
a
profit
which
her
cupidity
made
her
reluctant
to
lose
for
even
half
an
hour
and
thus
to
have
dicky
carry
on
the
business
and
in
his
enthusiasm
he
did
it
very
well
was
a
further
consideration
father
sturt
chatted
with
dicky
till
the
boy
could
scarce
plait
for
very
pride
would
not
dicky
like
to
work
regularly
every
day
asked
father
sturt
and
earn
wages
dicky
could
see
no
graceful
answer
but
the
affirmative
and
in
sober
earnest
he
thought
he
would
father
sturt
took
hold
of
dicky
vanity
was
he
not
capable
of
something
better
than
other
jago
boys
why
should
he
not
earn
regular
wages
and
live
comfortably
well
fed
and
clothed
with
no
fear
of
the
police
and
no
shame
for
what
he
did
might
do
it
when
others
could
not
they
were
not
clever
enough
they
called
themselves
and
said
father
sturt
there
one
of
them
that
can
deceive
me
and
dicky
knew
there
was
not
one
most
did
no
work
the
vicar
argument
went
on
because
they
had
neither
the
pluck
to
try
nor
the
intelligence
to
accomplish
else
why
did
they
live
the
wretched
jago
life
instead
of
take
the
pleasanter
time
of
the
decent
labourer
dicky
already
zealous
at
work
as
exampled
in
rush
listened
with
wistful
pride
yes
if
he
could
he
would
work
and
take
his
place
over
the
envious
heads
of
his
jago
friends
but
how
nobody
would
employ
a
boy
living
in
the
jago
that
was
notorious
the
address
was
a
testimonial
for
miles
round
all
the
same
when
mrs
bates
at
last
took
away
her
belongings
dicky
ran
off
in
delighted
amaze
to
tell
his
mother
and
em
that
he
was
going
to
tea
at
father
sturt
rooms
and
the
wreckers
tore
down
the
foul
old
houses
laying
bare
the
secret
dens
of
a
century
of
infamy
lifting
out
the
wide
sashes
of
the
old
windows
the
one
good
feature
in
the
structures
letting
light
and
air
at
last
into
the
subterraneous
basements
where
men
and
women
had
swarmed
and
bred
and
died
like
wolves
in
their
lairs
and
emerging
from
clouds
of
choking
dust
each
man
a
colony
of
vermin
but
there
were
rooms
which
the
wreckers
no
neither
flatly
refused
to
enter
and
nothing
would
make
them
but
much
coaxing
the
promise
of
extra
pay
and
the
certainty
of
much
immediate
beer

mr
grinder
kept
a
shop
in
the
bethnal
green
road
it
was
announced
in
brilliant
lettering
as
an
colour
and
italian
warehouse
and
there
in
addition
to
the
oil
and
the
colour
and
whatever
of
italian
there
might
have
been
he
sold
pots
pans
kettles
brooms
shovels
mops
lamps
nails
and
treacle
it
was
a
shop
ever
too
tight
for
its
stock
which
burst
forth
at
every
available
opening
and
heaped
so
high
on
the
paving
that
the
window
was
half
buried
in
a
bank
of
shining
tin
father
sturt
was
one
of
the
best
customers
the
oil
candles
and
utensils
needed
for
church
and
club
all
coming
from
mr
grinder
mr
grinder
was
losing
his
who
had
found
a
better
situation
and
father
sturt
determined
that
could
but
the
be
persuaded
dicky
perrott
should
be
the
new
boy
mr
grinder
was
persuaded
chiefly
perhaps
because
the
vicar
undertook
to
make
good
the
loss
should
the
experiment
end
in
theft
partly
because
it
was
policy
to
oblige
a
good
customer
and
partly
indeed
because
mr
grinder
was
willing
to
give
such
a
boy
a
chance
in
life
for
he
was
no
bad
fellow
as
go
and
had
been
an
errand
boy
himself
so
that
there
came
a
monday
morning
when
dicky
his
clothes
as
well
mended
as
might
be
for
hannah
perrott
no
more
than
another
jago
could
disobey
father
sturt
and
a
apron
of
his
mother
tied
before
him
stood
by
mr
grinder
bank
of
pots
and
kettles
in
an
eager
agony
to
sell
something
and
near
blind
with
the
pride
of
the
thing
he
had
been
waiting
at
the
long
ere
mr
grinder
was
out
of
bed
and
now
set
to
guard
the
outside
stock
a
duty
not
to
be
neglected
in
that
neighbourhood
he
brushed
a
tin
pot
here
and
there
with
his
sleeve
and
longed
for
some
jago
friend
to
pass
and
view
him
in
his
new
greatness
the
goods
he
watched
over
were
an
unfailing
source
of
interest
and
he
learned
by
much
repetition
the
prices
of
all
the
saucepans
painted
in
blue
distemper
on
the
tin
and
ranging
from
on
the
big
pots
in
the
bottom
row
to
on
the
very
little
ones
at
the
top
and
there
were
long
ranks
of
little
paraffin
lamps
at
a
penny
the
sort
that
had
set
fire
to
a
garret
in
half
jago
street
a
month
since
and
burnt
old
mother
leary
to
a
greasy
cinder
with
a
smaller
array
of
a
superior
quality
at
just
like
the
one
that
had
burst
at
jerry
gullen
and
burnt
the
bed
while
over
his
head
swung
doormats
at
with
penny
mousetraps
dangling
from
their
corners
when
he
grew
more
accustomed
to
his
circumstances
he
bethought
him
to
collect
a
little
dirt
and
rub
it
down
the
front
of
his
apron
to
give
himself
a
and
appearance
and
he
greatly
impeded
women
who
looked
at
the
saucepans
and
the
mousetraps
ere
they
entered
the
shop
by
his
anxiety
to
cut
them
off
from
mr
grinder
and
serve
them
himself
he
remembered
the
boy
at
the
in
bishopsgate
street
years
ago
who
had
chased
him
through
spitalfields
and
he
wished
that
some
lurching
youngster
would
snatch
a
mousetrap
that
he
might
make
a
chase
himself
at
mr
grinder
every
call
dicky
was
prompt
and
willing
for
every
new
duty
was
a
fresh
delight
and
the
whole
day
a
prolonged
game
of
real
shopkeeping
and
at
his
tea
he
was
to
have
tea
each
day
in
addition
to
three
and
sixpence
every
saturday
he
took
scarce
five
minutes
there
was
a
trolley
just
such
a
thing
as
porters
used
at
railway
stations
but
smaller
which
was
his
own
particular
implement
his
own
to
pack
parcels
on
for
delivery
to
such
few
customers
as
did
not
carry
away
their
own
purchases
and
to
acquire
the
dexterous
management
of
this
trolley
was
a
pure
joy
he
bolted
his
tea
to
start
the
sooner
on
a
to
a
two
hundred
yards
away
his
enthusiasm
for
work
as
an
amusement
cooled
in
a
day
or
two
but
all
his
pride
in
it
remained
the
fight
with
dove
lane
waxed
amain
but
dicky
would
not
be
tempted
into
more
than
a
distant
interest
in
it
in
his
he
saw
himself
a
tradesman
with
a
shop
of
his
own
and
the
name
perrott
with
a
gold
flourish
over
the
door
he
would
employ
a
boy
himself
then
and
there
would
be
a
parlour
with
chairs
and
a
shade
of
flowers
and
em
grown
up
and
playing
on
the
piano
truly
father
sturt
was
right
the
hooks
were
fools
and
the
straight
game
was
the
better
bobby
roper
the
hunchback
went
past
the
shop
once
and
saw
him
dicky
minding
his
new
dignity
ignored
his
enemy
and
for
the
first
time
for
a
year
and
more
allowed
him
to
pass
without
either
taunt
or
blow
the
other
astonished
at
dicky
new
occupation
came
back
and
back
again
staring
from
a
safe
distance
at
dicky
and
the
shop
dicky
on
his
part
took
no
more
notice
than
to
assume
an
ostentatious
vigilance
so
that
the
hunchback
baring
his
teeth
in
a
snigger
of
malice
at
last
turned
on
his
heel
and
rolled
off
twice
kiddo
cook
passed
but
made
no
sign
of
recognition
beyond
a
wink
and
dicky
felt
grateful
for
kiddo
obvious
fear
of
compromising
him
once
old
beveridge
came
by
striding
rapidly
his
tatters
flying
and
the
legend
up
chalked
on
his
hat
as
was
his
manner
in
his
town
rambles
he
stopped
abruptly
at
sight
of
dicky
stooped
and
said
perrott
hum
hum
hey
then
he
hurried
on
doubtless
conceiving
just
such
a
fear
as
kiddo
cook
as
for
tommy
rann
his
affections
were
alienated
by
dicky
outset
refusal
to
secrete
treacle
in
a
tin
mug
for
a
midnight
carouse
and
he
did
not
show
himself
so
matters
went
for
near
a
week
but
mr
weech
missed
dicky
sadly
it
was
rare
for
a
day
to
pass
without
a
visit
from
dicky
and
dicky
had
a
way
of
bringing
good
things
mr
weech
would
not
have
sold
dicky
custom
for
ten
shillings
a
week
so
that
when
mr
weech
inquired
and
found
that
dicky
was
at
work
in
an
he
was
naturally
annoyed
moreover
if
dicky
perrott
got
into
way
of
life
he
would
have
no
fear
for
himself
and
might
get
talking
inconveniently
among
his
new
friends
about
the
business
affairs
of
mr
aaron
weech
and
at
this
reflection
that
philanthropist
grew
thoughtful
xix
dicky
had
gone
on
an
errand
and
mr
grinder
was
at
the
shop
door
when
there
appeared
before
him
a
whiskered
and
smirking
figure
with
a
quick
glance
each
way
along
the
street
and
a
long
and
smiling
one
at
the
necktie
mornin
mr
grinder
good
mornin
sir
mr
weech
stroked
his
left
palm
with
his
right
fist
and
nodded
pleasantly
in
business
meself
over
in
meakin
street
name
of
weech
you
know
the
shop
i
i
jist
over
to
ask
grinder
led
the
way
into
the
shop
ask
so
to
make
things
quite
sure
though
no
doubt
it
all
right
to
ask
if
it
correct
you
awfferin
brass
at
a
shillin
each
at
a
shillin
exclaimed
grinder
shocked
at
the
notion
no
mr
weech
appeared
mildly
surprised
yut
jars
o
jam
pickles
at
sixpence
he
pursued
with
his
eye
on
those
ranged
behind
the
counter
doormats
at
fourpence
not
mr
weech
face
fell
into
a
blank
perplexity
he
pawed
his
ear
with
a
doubtful
air
murmuring
absently
i
sure
fourpence
an
sixpence
for
pickles
an
bring
round
after
the
shop
was
shut
but
there
he
added
more
briskly
no
done
an
no
doubt
it
a
mistake
he
turned
as
though
to
leave
but
grinder
restrained
him
look
he
said
want
to
know
about
this
wotjer
mean
was
goin
to
bring
round
pickles
after
the
shop
was
shut
said
fourpence
for
doormats
i
expect
it
jest
a
little
mistake
that
all
answered
weech
making
another
motion
toward
the
door
i
do
want
to
git
nobody
into
trouble
nice
trouble
i
be
in
if
i
sold
brass
for
a
bob
there
somethink
as
i
ought
to
know
about
tell
me
about
it
straight
weech
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
top
waistcoat
button
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
said
i
better
i
can
feel
for
you
mr
grinder
a
feelin
an
bein
in
business
meself
your
boy
out
back
soon
yut
come
in
the
there
mr
weech
with
ingenuous
reluctance
assured
mr
grinder
that
dicky
perrott
had
importuned
him
to
buy
the
goods
in
question
at
the
prices
he
had
mentioned
together
with
others
readily
named
now
that
the
swallowed
so
freely
and
that
they
were
to
be
delivered
and
paid
for
at
night
when
dicky
left
work
but
perhaps
mr
weech
concluded
parading
an
obstinate
belief
in
human
nature
perhaps
the
boy
being
new
to
the
business
had
mistaken
the
prices
and
was
merely
doing
his
best
to
push
his
master
trade
fear
o
that
said
grinder
shaking
his
head
gloomily
the
least
fear
o
that
knows
the
cheapest
doormats
i
got
one

customers

dozen
times

mr
weech

seen
when

of

that

genavin
dicky

you
know
as
the
the
psalm
says
mr
grinder
your
boy
back
is
and
after
peering
cautiously
mr
weech
went
his
way
xx
dicky
completed
his
round
and
pushed
his
unladen
trolley
with
a
fuller
sense
of
responsibility
than
ever
for
he
carried
money
a
publican
had
paid
him
four
and
threepence
and
he
had
taken
two
and
tenpence
elsewhere
he
had
left
his
proud
signature
pencilled
large
and
black
on
two
receipts
and
he
stopped
in
a
dozen
doorways
to
count
the
money
over
again
and
make
sure
that
all
was
right
between
the
halts
he
added
four
and
three
to
two
and
ten
mentally
and
proved
his
sum
correct
by
subtracting
each
in
turn
from
seven
and
a
penny
and
at
last
he
stood
his
trolley
on
end
by
the
bank
of
saucepans
and
entered
the
shop
is
paid
an
wilkins
is
paid
said
dicky
putting
down
the
money
an
ten
an
four
an
three
seven
an
a
penny
mr
grinder
looked
steadily
and
sourly
at
dicky
and
counted
he
pitched
the
odd
penny
into
the
till
and
shook
the
rest
of
the
coins
in
his
closed
hand
still
staring
moodily
in
the
boy
face
three
six
a
week
you
come
at
he
said
sir
dicky
replied
since
grinder
seemed
to
expect
an
answer
the
supreme
moment
when
he
should
take
his
first
wages
had
been
the
beacon
to
him
reddening
and
brightening
as
saturday
night
grew
nearer
an
six
a
week
an
yer
tea
dicky
wondered
as
if
i
found
out
anythink
about
say
brass
for
instance
i
could
give
ye
yer
three
an
six
an
start
y
auf
unless
i
did
somethin
wuss
dicky
was
all
incomprehension
but
something
made
him
feel
a
little
sick
i
find
out
anythink
about
say
jars
pickles
an
i
was
disposed
to
suspect
anythink
in
regard
to
say
doormats
then
i
could
either
give
ye
a
week
s
notice
or
pay
a
week
money
an
clear
y
out
on
the
spot
without
no
more
trouble
mr
grinder
paused
and
still
looked
at
dicky
with
calm
dislike
then
he
added
as
though
in
answer
to
himself
he
dropped
the
money
slowly
from
his
right
hand
to
his
left
mouth
was
dry
and
the
drawers
and
swam
before
him
at
each
side
of
grinder
head
what
did
it
mean
y
are
cried
mr
grinder
with
sudden
energy
thrusting
his
hand
across
the
counter
is
seven
shillin
an
you
can
git
yer
tea
at
with
yer
dirty
little
sister
git
out
o
my
shop
dicky
hand
closed
mechanically
on
the
money
and
after
a
pause
he
found
broken
speech
w
wot
for
sir
he
asked
huskily
ai
done
nothink
an
you
do
nothink
that
more
out
ye
go
if
i
see
ye
near
the
place
agin
i
ye
locked
up
dicky
slunk
to
the
door
he
felt
the
sobs
coming
but
he
turned
at
the
threshold
and
said
with
tremulous
lips
gim
me
a
chance
sir
me
i
done
me
best
i
mr
grinder
made
a
short
rush
from
the
back
of
the
shop
and
dicky
gave
up
and
fled
it
was
all
over
there
could
never
be
a
shop
with
perrott
painted
over
it
now
there
would
be
no
parlour
with
chairs
and
a
piano
for
em
to
play
he
was
cut
off
from
the
trolley
for
ever
dicky
was
thirteen
and
at
that
age
the
children
of
the
jago
were
past
childish
tears
but
tears
he
could
not
smother
even
till
he
might
find
a
they
burst
out
shamefully
in
the
open
street
he
took
dark
turnings
and
hid
his
head
in
doorways
it
was
very
bitter
at
last
when
the
sobs
grew
fewer
he
remembered
the
money
gripped
in
his
wet
fist
it
was
a
consolation
seven
shillings
was
a
vast
sum
in
dicky
eyes
until
that
day
he
had
never
handled
so
much
in
his
life
it
would
have
been
handsome
recompense
he
thought
for
any
trouble
in
the
world
but
this
he
must
take
it
home
of
course
it
might
avail
to
buy
sympathy
of
his
father
and
mother
but
then
to
think
he
might
have
had
as
much
every
fortnight
of
his
life
a
good
tea
every
day
and
the
proud
responsibility
and
the
trolley
at
this
his
lips
came
awry
again
his
eyes
sought
his
sleeve
and
he
turned
to
another
doorway
his
glance
fell
on
the
white
apron
now
smudged
and
greased
in
good
earnest
it
made
him
feel
worse
so
he
untied
it
and
stuffed
it
away
under
his
jacket
he
wondered
vaguely
what
had
occurred
to
irritate
mr
grinder
and
why
he
talked
of
pickles
and
doormats
but
the
sorrow
of
it
all
afflicted
him
to
the
extinction
of
such
minor
speculation
and
in
this
misery
he
dragged
his
reluctant
feet
toward
the
old
jago
xxi
he
handed
his
father
the
seven
shillings
and
received
a
furious
belting
for
losing
his
situation
he
cried
quietly
but
it
was
not
because
of
the
strap
all
he
feared
now
was
to
meet
father
sturt
he
had
rather
fifty
beltings
than
father
sturt
reproaches
and
having
disgraced
himself
with
mr
grinder
in
some
mysterious
way
which
it
was
beyond
his
capacity
to
understand
what
but
reproaches
could
he
expect
from
the
vicar
the
whole
world
was
against
him
as
for
himself
he
was
hopeless
plainly
he
must
have
some
incomprehensible
defect
of
nature
since
he
offended
do
as
he
might
and
could
neither
understand
nor
redeem
his
fault
he
wondered
if
it
had
been
so
with
little
neddy
wright
who
had
found
the
world
too
ruthless
for
him
at
ten
and
had
tied
a
brick
to
his
neck
as
he
had
seen
done
with
needless
dogs
and
let
himself
timidly
down
into
the
canal
at
haggerstone
bridge
so
he
shuffled
through
jago
row
when
a
hand
came
on
his
shoulder
and
a
hoarse
voice
said
the
matter
dicky
he
turned
and
saw
the
mild
coarse
face
of
pigeony
poll
the
jaw
whereof
was
labouring
on
something
tough
and
sticky
poll
pulled
from
her
pocket
a
glutinous
paper
clinging
about
a
cohesive
lump
of
broken
toffee
the
one
luxury
of
her
moneyed
times
a
bit
she
said
the
matter
but
dicky
thrust
the
hand
away
and
fled
for
he
feared
another
burst
of
tears
his
eyes
were
bad
enough
as
it
was
and
he
longed
to
hide
himself
in
some
hole
he
turned
into
new
jago
street
hither
it
was
that
jerry
gullen
had
betaken
himself
with
his
family
and
the
canary
after
the
great
eviction
dicky
slackened
his
pace
loitered
at
jerry
doorway
and
presently
found
himself
in
the
common
passage
it
was
long
since
he
had
had
a
private
interview
with
jerry
gullen
canary
for
indeed
he
was
thirteen
he
was
no
longer
a
child
in
fact
and
it
was
not
well
that
he
should
indulge
in
such
foolish
weakness
nevertheless
he
went
as
far
as
the
back
door
there
stood
the
old
donkey
mangy
and
infirm
as
ever
but
apparently
no
nearer
the
end
the
wood
of
the
fence
was
bitten
in
places
but
it
was
not
as
yet
gnawed
to
the
general
whiteness
and
roundness
of
that
in
canary
old
abode
canary
indeed
was
fortunate
for
at
the
sound
of
dicky
step
he
lifted
his
nose
from
a
small
heap
of
straw
dust
and
mouldy
hay
swept
into
a
corner
dicky
stepped
into
the
yard
and
put
his
hand
on
canary
neck
presently
he
glanced
guiltily
at
the
windows
above
nobody
was
looking
and
in
five
minutes
dicky
aged
as
he
was
had
told
canary
his
troubles
while
new
tears
wetted
the
ragged
crest
and
dropped
into
the
dusty
straw
now
his
grief
lost
some
of
its
edge
ashamed
as
he
was
he
had
a
shapeless
unapprehended
notion
that
canary
was
the
sole
creature
alive
that
could
understand
and
feel
with
him
and
canary
poked
his
nose
under
the
old
jacket
and
sniffed
in
sympathy
as
the
broken
lining
tickled
him
dicky
intellectuals
began
to
arrange
themselves
plainly
mr
weech
philosophy
was
right
after
all
he
was
of
the
jago
and
he
must
prey
on
the
outer
world
as
all
the
jago
did
not
stray
foolishly
off
the
regular
track
in
chase
of
visions
and
fall
headlong
father
sturt
was
a
creature
of
another
mould
who
was
he
dicky
perrott
that
he
should
break
away
from
the
jago
habit
and
strain
after
another
nature
what
could
come
of
it
but
defeat
and
bitterness
as
old
beveridge
had
said
the
jago
had
got
him
why
should
he
fight
against
the
inevitable
and
bruise
himself
the
ways
out
of
the
jago
old
beveridge
had
told
him
years
ago
gaol
the
gallows
and
the
high
mob
there
was
his
chance
his
aspiration
his
goal
the
high
mob
to
dream
of
or
regular
wages
was
foolishness
his
bed
was
made
in
the
jago
and
he
must
lie
on
it
his
hope
in
life
if
he
might
have
a
hope
at
all
was
to
be
of
the
high
mob
spare
nobody
stop
at
nothing
do
his
devilmost
old
beveridge
had
said
that
years
ago
the
task
was
before
him
and
he
must
not
balk
at
it
as
for
gaol
and
the
gallows
well
there
they
were
and
he
could
not
help
it
ill
ways
out
of
the
jago
both
but
still
ways
out
he
rubbed
his
face
carefully
with
his
sleeve
put
away
his
foolish
ambitions
and
went
forth
with
a
brave
heart
to
accomplish
his
destiny
for
well
or
ill
a
jago
rat
to
do
his
devilmost
but
to
avoid
father
sturt
out
he
went
into
shoreditch
high
street
and
there
he
prowled
the
evening
away
there
and
in
norton
folgate
but
he
touched
for
nothing
nothing
at
all
he
feared
lest
his
week
honesty
had
damaged
his
training
even
an
apple
on
a
stall
he
failed
at
and
had
to
run
and
then
he
turned
into
bethnal
green
road
but
here
a
thought
checked
him
suddenly
what
of
mr
grinder
he
had
threatened
to
have
dicky
locked
up
if
he
came
near
the
shop
again
but
a
child
of
the
jago
knew
too
much
to
be
frightened
by
such
a
threat
as
that
he
went
on
he
felt
interested
to
see
how
his
late
employer
was
getting
along
without
him
and
who
was
minding
the
goods
outside
the
shop
probably
there
was
nobody
and
this
gave
dicky
an
idea
he
had
forgotten
his
smudgy
apron
folded
and
tucked
away
in
the
lining
of
his
jacket
now
he
pulled
it
out
and
fastened
it
before
him
once
more
he
knew
mr
grinder
habits
in
the
shop
and
if
he
could
seize
a
fitting
opportunity
he
might
be
able
attired
in
his
apron
to
pick
up
or
reach
down
any
article
that
struck
his
fancy
fearless
of
interference
from
for
he
would
seem
to
be
still
with
that
he
hastened
for
it
was
near
closing
time
at
grinder
he
took
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
the
better
to
observe
unseen
in
the
darkness
but
mr
grinder
had
already
begun
to
carry
things
in
from
the
pavement
as
dicky
looked
he
came
out
with
a
long
pole
wherewith
he
unhooked
from
above
a
clattering
cluster
of
pails
and
watering
pots
and
a
bunch
of
doormats
the
doormats
he
let
fall
on
the
flags
while
he
carried
in
the
pots
and
pails
dicky
knew
that
these
pots
and
pails
were
kept
at
night
in
a
shed
behind
the
house
so
he
scuttled
across
the
road
opening
the
blade
of
his
old
knife
as
he
ran
he
cut
the
string
that
held
the
mats
together
selected
a
thick
one
rolled
it
under
his
arm
and
edged
off
into
the
shadow
then
he
ran
quietly
across
to
the
nearest
turning
presently
mr
grinder
came
out
hooked
his
finger
in
the
string
among
the
mats
and
pulled
up
nothing
he
stooped
and
saw
that
the
string
was
cut
he
looked
about
him
suspiciously
flung
the
mats
over
and
counted
them
then
he
stood
erect
stared
up
the
street
down
the
street
and
across
the
road
with
his
mouth
open
and
made
short
rushes
left
and
right
into
the
gloom
then
he
returned
to
the
mats
and
scratched
his
head
finally
he
gave
another
glance
about
the
street
picked
up
the
mats
in
his
arms
and
carried
them
in
counting
them
as
he
went
and
the
mats
bestowed
whenever
he
came
forth
for
a
fresh
armful
of
saucepans
he
stood
and
gazed
doubtfully
now
this
way
now
that
about
the
bethnal
green
road
mr
aaron
weech
was
pushing
his
last
shutter
into
its
place
when
the
knives
said
dicky
perrott
in
perfunctory
repetition
of
the
old
formula
mr
weech
seemed
taken
aback
that
he
asked
doubtfully
pointing
at
the
doormat
then
after
a
sharp
look
about
the
almost
deserted
street
he
ran
to
jago
row
corner
twenty
yards
away
and
looked
down
there
nobody
was
hiding
and
he
came
back
he
led
the
way
into
the
shop
and
closed
the
door
then
looking
keenly
in
dicky
face
he
suddenly
asked
toldjer
to
bring

answered
sullenly

replied
mr
weech
suddenly
broke
into
a
loud
laugh
but
kept
his
keen
look
on
the
boy
face
nevertheless
it
a
good
joke
dicky
ai
it
he
said
and
laughed
again

he

at
the
mat
mr

and
grinned

genuine
grin

said

that

not

cake
dicky
answered
doggedly
want
fourpence
i
wo
take
no
less
the
good
weech
was
unwilling
that
dicky
should
find
another
market
after
all
so
he
submitted
to
the
extortion
well
he
said
with
a
sigh
pulling
out
the
extra
coppers
for
this
once
then

next
time

i
sorry

now
dicky
pocketed
his
pence
and
made
for
home
while
mr
weech
chuckling
gently
at
his
morning
prophecy
of
a
doormat
for
fourpence
carried
the
plunder
to
the
room
reserved
for
new
and
unused
stock
promising
himself
however
a
peep
at
grinder
shop
in
the
morning
to
make
quite
sure
that
dicky
had
really
left
so
ended
dicky
dealings
with
the
house
of
grinder
when
father
sturt
next
saw
the
and
inquired
of
dicky
progress
he
was
met
with
solemn
congratulations
that
no
larcenies
were
to
pay
for
mr
sagacity
it
seemed
had
enabled
him
to
detect
and
crush
at
the
outset
dicky
plans
for
selling
stock
wholesale
on
his
own
account
out
of
consideration
for
the
vicar
recommendation
he
had
refrained
from
handing
the
boy
over
to
the
police
but
had
paid
him
a
week
in
advance
and
dismissed
him
father
sturt
insisted
on
repaying
the
money
and
went
his
way
with
a
heavy
heart
for
if
this
were
what
came
of
the
promising
among
his
flock
what
of
the
others
for
some
while
he
saw
nothing
of
dicky
and
the
incident
fell
back
among
a
crowd
of
others
in
his
remembrance
for
dicky
was
but
one
among
thousands
and
the
disappointment
was
but
one
of
many
hundreds
lying
awake
that
night
but
with
closed
eyes
dicky
heard
his
mother
talking
with
his
father
suggest
that
perhaps
an
enemy
had
earwigged
grinder
and
told
him
a
tale
that
had
brought
about
dicky
dismissal
somebody
perhaps
who
wanted
the
situation
for
somebody
else
josh
perrott
did
no
more
than
grunt
at
the
guess
but
it
gave
a
new
light
to
dicky
clearly
that
would
account
for
grinder
change
but
who
could
the
be
the
little
clock
on
the
ticked
away
busily
in
the
silence
and
dicky
instantly
thought
of
the
hunchback
he
it
must
have
been
without
a
doubt
who
else
was
he
not
hanging
about
the
shop
staring
and
sneering
but
a
day
or
two
back
and
was
it
not
he
who
had
pursued
him
with
malice
on
every
occasion
in
school
and
out
had
not
bobby
roper
this
very
trick
of
lying
tales
where
was
the
gratuitous
injury
in
all
these
four
years
that
had
not
been
bobby
roper
work
dicky
trembled
with
rage
as
he
lay
and
he
resolved
on
condign
revenge
the
war
with
dove
lane
was
over
for
the
time
being
but
that
made
it
easier
for
him
to
catch
his
enemy
xxii
the
feud
between
the
jago
and
dove
lane
was
eternal
just
as
was
that
between
the
ranns
and
the
learys
but
like
the
rann
and
leary
feud
it
had
its
paroxysms
and
its
intervals
and
in
both
cases
the
close
of
a
paroxysm
was
signalised
by
a
great
show
of
amity
between
the
factions
bob
rann
and
billy
leary
would
drink
affably
from
the
same
pot
and
norah
walsh
and
sally
green
would
call
each
other
while
jagos
and
would
mingle
in
bars
and
lend
pinches
of
tobacco
and
call
each
other
a
paroxysm
in
the
war
had
now
passed
and
reconciliation
was
due
the
had
been
heavily
thrashed
their
benjamins
and
kicksies
had
been
impounded
in
meakin
street
and
they
had
ceased
from
buying
dove
lane
itself
had
been
swept
from
end
to
end
by
the
victorious
jago
and
the
populations
of
both
were
dotted
thickly
with
bandaged
heads
this
satisfactory
state
of
things
achieved
there
was
little
reason
left
for
fighting
moreover
if
fighting
persisted
too
long
at
a
time
the
police
were
apt
to
turn
up
in
numbers
subjecting
the
neighbourhood
to
much
inconvenient
scrutiny
and
very
often
coming
across
jagos
or
even
on
old
accounts
so
peace
was
declared
and
as
a
visible
sign
thereof
it
was
determined
that
the
should
visit
the
jago
in
a
body
there
to
join
in
a
at
mother
gapp
mother
gapp
was
chosen
not
only
because
it
mother
gapp
an
important
consideration
but
also
because
of
the
large
room
behind
the
bar
called
the
which
had
long
ago
been
made
of
two
rooms
and
a
big
cupboard
by
the
cutting
away
of
crazy
partitions
from
the
crazy
walls
scarce
was
it
dark
when
the
in
a
succession
of
hilarious
groups
but
withal
a
trifle
suspicious
began
to
push
through
mother
gapp
doors
their
caps
pulled
down
to
their
ears
their
hands
in
their
pockets
their
shoulders
humped
and
their
jackets
buttoned
tight
they
lurched
through
the
jago
grinning
with
uneasy
affability
at
the
greetings
that
met
them
being
less
practised
than
the
jagos
in
the
assumption
of
elaborate
cordiality
in
the
of
the
feathers
there
were
but
three
or
four
of
the
other
party
though
the
bar
was
packed
the
three
or
four
of
whom
josh
perrott
was
one
were
by
way
of
a
committee
of
stewards
deputed
to
bid
the
welcome
and
to
help
them
to
seats
the
jagos
were
in
some
sort
in
the
situation
of
hosts
and
it
had
been
decided
after
debate
that
it
would
ill
become
them
to
take
their
places
till
their
guests
were
seated
the
punctilio
of
the
jago
on
such
occasions
was
a
marvel
ever
so
josh
perrott
stood
at
one
side
of
the
door
and
billy
leary
at
the
other
shaking
hands
with
all
who
entered
and
strenuously
maintaining
cheerful
grins
now
the
jago
smile
was
a
smile
by
itself
unlike
the
smiles
in
other
places
it
faded
suddenly
and
left
the
face
the
jago
face
drawn
and
sad
and
startling
by
contrast
as
of
a
man
betrayed
into
mirth
in
the
midst
of
great
sorrow
so
that
a
persistent
grin
was
known
for
a
work
of
conscious
effort
the
came
in
still
larger
numbers
than
had
been
expected
and
before
long
it
was
perceived
that
there
would
be
little
space
in
the
if
any
at
all
for
the
jagos
already
the
visitors
seemed
to
fill
the
place
but
they
still
kept
coming
and
found
places
by
squeezing
there
was
some
doubt
as
to
what
had
best
be
done
meanwhile
the
began
for
at
least
a
score
were
anxious
to
at
once
and
every
moment
fresh
volunteers
arose
many
stood
up
and
so
made
more
room
but
more
came
and
still
more
till
the
could
hold
not
another
and
the
very
walls
were
like
to
burst
under
the
low
ceiling
hung
a
layer
of
smoke
that
obscured
the
face
of
the
man
standing
on
the
table
at
the
end
to
sing
and
under
the
smoke
was
a
array
of
heads
hats
and
clay
pipes
much
diversified
by
white
bandages
and
black
eyes
such
as
came
in
now
were
fain
to
find
places
in
the
bar
if
they
could
and
a
crowd
of
jagos
men
and
women
hung
about
the
doors
of
the
feathers
more
fortunate
than
other
boys
dicky
who
would
go
anywhere
to
hear
what
purported
to
be
music
had
succeeded
in
worming
himself
through
the
bar
and
almost
to
the
door
of
the
but
he
could
get
no
farther
and
now
he
stood
compressed
bounded
on
the
face
by
cocko
harnwell
and
on
the
back
of
the
head
by
fluffy
pike
moleskin
waistcoat
with
pearlies
down
the
front
and
the
artful
dodge
over
the
pockets
pud
palmer
one
of
the
reception
committee
was
singing
he
accompanied
his
chorus
by
a
step
dance
and
all
the
company
stamped
in
sympathy
a
fighter
she
a
biter
she
a

a

dicky
clung
to
cocko
harnwell
lest
he
were
trampled
to
death
and
for
a
while
he
was
flung
about
crushed
and
bruised
among
rushing
men
like
a
swimmer
among
breakers
while
the
air
was
rent
with
howls
and
the
smash
of
glass
for
the
floor
had
given
way
it
had
been
built
but
slightly
in
the
beginning
as
floor
for
two
small
rooms
and
a
cupboard
with
little
weight
to
carry
old
and
rotten
now
and
put
to
the
strain
of
a
multitude
stamping
in
unison
it
had
failed
utterly
and
had
let
down
a
struggling
mob
of
men
five
feet
on
the
barrels
in
the
cellar
and
jumbled
with
tables
pots
wooden
forms
lighted
pipes
and
splintered
joinery
from
the
midst
of
the
stramash
a
bawled
aloud
that
it
was
a
trap
and
instantly
jagos
and
were
at
each
others
throats
and
it
was
like
to
go
hard
with
the
few
jagos
among
the
ruins
billy
leary
laid
about
him
desperately
with
a
ragged
piece
of
flooring
while
josh
perrott
and
pud
palmer
battered
with
quart
pots
then
it
was
shouted
without
that
the
were
exterminating
the
jagos
within
and
a
torrent
of
jagos
burst
through
the
doors
poured
through
the
bar
and
over
the
threshold
into
the
confusion
below
dicky
bruised
frightened
and
flung
like
a
rag
this
way
and
that
at
last
made
shift
to
grasp
a
post
and
climb
up
on
the
bar
counter
mother
gapp
a
dishevelled
maniac
was
dancing
amid
pots
and
broken
glass
black
in
the
face
screaming
inaudibly
dicky
stumbled
along
the
counter
climbed
over
the
broken
end
of
a
partition
and
fell
into
the
arms
of
kiddo
cook
coming
in
with
the
rush
the
boy
out
yelled
kiddo
turning
and
heaving
him
over
the
heads
behind
him
somebody
caught
dicky
by
a
leg
and
an
arm
his
head
hit
the
door
post
the
world
turned
a
about
him
and
he
came
down
with
a
crash
he
was
on
the
flags
of
old
jago
street
with
all
his
breath
driven
out
of
him
but
he
was
quickly
on
his
feet
again
a
crowd
beat
against
the
front
of
mother
gapp
and
reinforcements
came
running
from
everywhere
with
the
familiar
jago
tight
dove
lane
had
abused
the
jago
hospitality
woe
to
the
there
were
scuffles
here
and
there
where
who
had
never
reached
the
or
who
had
been
crowded
out
of
it
made
for
escape
dicky
was
shaken
and
sore
but
he
pulled
himself
together
resolutely
he
had
seen
a
few
dove
lane
boys
about
before
he
had
got
into
the
feathers
and
plainly
it
was
his
duty
to
find
them
and
bash
them
moreover
he
wondered
what
had
become
of
his
father
he
hastened
through
the
dark
passage
of
the
house
next
to
mother
gapp
into
the
back
yard
and
through
the
broken
fence
there
was
a
door
in
the
wall
and
through
this
he
thought
to
see
what
was
going
forward
the
cellar
at
any
rate
at
the
farther
end
was
a
pit
of
writhing
forms
and
the
din
rose
loud
as
ever
a
short
figure
stood
black
against
the
light
and
held
by
the
looking
down
at
the
riot
dicky
knew
it
he
sprang
at
bobby
roper
pulled
him
by
the
arm
and
struck
at
him
furiously
the
hunchback
whimpering
did
his
best
to
retaliate
and
to
get
away
but
dicky
raging
at
the
remembrance
of
his
fancied
injury
struck
savagely
and
struck
again
till
bobby
roper
tripped
backward
over
the
projecting
end
of
a
broken
and
pitched
headlong
into
the
cellar
he
struck
a
barrel
and
rolled
over
falling
into
the
space
between
that
and
two
other
barrels
dicky
looked
but
the
hunchback
did
not
move
then
some
of
the
flung
pots
at
the
lamps
hanging
against
the
walls
soon
they
were
smashed
and
fell
and
there
was
a
darkness
and
under
cover
thereof
the
aliens
essayed
flight
dicky
was
a
little
frightened
at
what
he
had
done
but
he
felt
that
with
bobby
roper
anything
was
justifiable
some
escaped
by
the
back
door
the
cellar
was
low
and
there
was
not
five
feet
between
the
barrels
and
the
broken
joists
and
these
dicky
avoided
by
getting
back
through
the
fence
in
the
end
most
of
the
enemy
struggled
away
by
one
means
or
another
and
when
lights
were
brought
at
last
the
jagos
were
found
pummelling
each
other
savagely
in
the
gloom
father
sturt
apprised
of
something
uncommon
by
the
exodus
of
members
from
the
club
finally
locked
the
doors
and
came
to
investigate
he
arrived
as
the
jagos
were
extricating
themselves
from
the
cellar
and
it
was
he
who
lifted
the
little
hunchback
from
among
the
barrels
and
carried
him
into
the
open
air
he
also
who
carried
him
home
no
bone
was
broken
and
no
joint
was
disturbed
but
there
was
a
serious
shock
many
contusions
and
a
cut
on
the
scalp
so
said
the
surgeon
whom
father
sturt
took
with
him
to
dove
lane
and
bobby
roper
lay
a
fortnight
in
bed
more
plaster
than
ever
embellished
the
heads
of
dove
lane
and
the
jago
that
night
but
for
the
jagos
there
was
compensation
for
down
among
the
barrels
lay
many
a
packet
of
tobacco
many
a
pair
of
boots
and
many
a
corner
stuffed
with
mixed
property
of
other
sorts
which
mother
gapp
had
fenced
for
many
a
month
back
so
that
it
happened
to
more
than
one
warrior
to
carry
home
again
something
with
which
he
had
run
between
the
long
before
and
had
sold
to
mother
gapp
for
what
she
would
give
the
ground
floor
of
the
feathers
stood
a
battered
shell
the
damage
of
four
years
ago
was
inconsiderable
compared
to
this
with
tears
and
blasphemy
mother
gapp
invaded
the
hoard
of
her
long
iniquity
to
buy
a
new
floor
but
it
was
the
larceny
the
taking
of
the
tobacco
and
the
boots
and
the
many
other
things
from
among
the
barrels
that
cut
her
to
the
soul
a
crool
a
crool
thing
was
such
robbery
sheer
robbery
said
mother
gapp
josh
perrott
got
a
bad
sprain
in
the
cellar
and
had
to
be
helped
home
more
he
took
with
him
not
a
single
piece
of
plunder
such
was
his
painful
disablement
xxiii
for
more
than
a
week
josh
perrott
could
not
walk
about
and
it
was
a
bad
week
for
some
little
while
his
luck
had
been
but
poor
and
now
he
found
himself
laid
up
with
a
total
reserve
fund
of
fourteenpence
a
coat
was
pawned
with
old
poll
rann
who
kept
a
leaving
shop
in
a
first
floor
back
in
jago
row
for
ninepence
then
josh
swore
at
dicky
for
not
being
still
at
grinder
and
told
him
to
turn
out
and
bring
home
some
money
dicky
had
risen
almost
too
sore
and
stiff
to
stand
on
the
morning
after
the
fight
at
the
feathers
and
he
was
little
better
now
but
he
had
to
go
and
he
went
though
he
well
knew
that
a
click
was
out
of
the
question
for
his
joints
almost
refused
to
bend
but
he
found
that
the
boys
were
contemplating
business
and
he
scouted
for
them
with
such
success
as
to
bring
home
sevenpence
in
the
evening
then
kiddo
cook
who
had
left
mother
gapp
with
a
double
armful
on
the
night
of
the
found
himself
rich
enough
being
a
bachelor
to
lend
josh
eighteenpence
and
a
shawl
of
hannah
perrott
was
pawned
that
though
was
redeemed
the
next
day
together
with
the
coat
for
dicky
brought
home
a
golden
sovereign
it
had
been
an
easy
click
scarce
a
click
at
all
perhaps
strictly
speaking
dicky
had
tramped
into
the
city
and
had
found
a
crowd
outside
st
paul
a
crowd
not
being
moved
on
for
something
was
going
forward
in
the
cathedral
he
recognised
one
of
the
high
mob
a
that
is
a
pickpocket
who
deals
in
purses
dicky
watched
this
man
movements
by
way
of
education
for
he
was
an
eminent
practitioner
and
worked
alone
with
no
assistant
to
cover
him
dicky
saw
him
in
the
thick
of
the
crowd
standing
beside
and
behind
one
lady
after
another
but
it
was
only
when
his
elbow
bent
to
slip
something
into
his
own
pocket
that
dicky
knew
he
had
presently
he
moved
to
another
part
of
the
crowd
where
mostly
men
were
standing
and
there
he
stealthily
let
drop
a
crumpled
newspaper
and
straightway
left
the
crowd
he
had
it
as
much
as
he
judged
safe
dicky
wriggled
toward
the
crumpled
paper
slipped
it
under
his
jacket
and
cleared
away
also
he
knew
that
there
was
something
in
the
paper
beside
news
that
in
fact
there
were
purses
in
it
purses
emptied
and
shed
as
soon
as
might
be
because
nobody
can
swear
to
money
but
strange
purses
lead
to
destruction
dicky
recked
little
of
this
danger
but
made
his
best
pace
to
a
recess
in
a
back
street
there
to
examine
his
pogues
for
though
the
uxter
was
gone
from
them
they
might
yet
bring
a
few
coppers
from
mr
weech
if
they
were
of
good
quality
they
were
a
fairly
sound
lot
one
had
a
large
clasp
that
looked
like
silver
and
another
was
quite
new
and
dicky
was
observing
with
satisfaction
the
of
the
lining
when
he
perceived
a
cunning
pocket
at
the
back
lying
flat
against
the
main
integument
and
in
it
was
a
sovereign
he
gulped
at
the
sight
clearly
the
emptying
the
pogues
in
his
pocket
by
sense
of
touch
had
missed
the
flat
pocket
dicky
was
not
yet
able
to
run
with
freedom
but
he
never
ceased
from
trotting
till
he
reached
his
own
staircase
in
old
jago
street
and
so
the
eight
or
nine
days
passed
and
josh
went
out
into
the
jago
with
no
more
than
a
tenderness
about
his
ankle
now
he
much
desired
a
good
click
so
he
went
across
high
street
shoreditch
to
kingsland
railway
station
and
bought
a
ticket
for
canonbury
luck
was
against
him
it
was
plain
he
tramped
the
northern
suburbs
from
three
till
dark
but
touched
for
nothing
he
spent
money
indeed
for
he
feared
to
overwork
his
ankle
and
for
that
reason
rested
in
divers
he
peeped
in
at
the
gates
of
quiet
gardens
in
the
hope
of
left
unwatched
or
lying
in
a
handy
but
he
saw
none
he
pried
about
the
doors
of
private
in
case
of
absent
grooms
and
unprotected
bunches
of
harness
but
in
vain
he
inspected
quiet
areas
and
kitchen
entrances
in
search
of
unguarded
spoons
even
descended
into
one
area
where
he
had
to
make
an
awkward
excuse
about
buying
old
bottles
in
consequence
of
meeting
the
cook
at
the
door
he
tramped
one
quiet
road
after
another
on
the
look
out
for
a
dead
a
house
furnished
but
untenanted
but
there
was
never
a
dead
it
seemed
in
all
the
northern
district
so
he
grew
tired
and
and
cursed
himself
for
that
he
had
not
driven
off
with
a
baker
horse
and
cart
that
had
tempted
him
early
in
the
afternoon
it
grew
twilight
and
then
dark
josh
sat
in
a
and
took
a
long
rest
and
some
bread
and
cheese
it
would
never
do
to
go
home
without
touching
and
for
some
time
he
considered
possibilities
with
regard
to
a
handful
of
silver
money
kept
in
a
glass
on
a
shelf
behind
the
bar
but
it
was
out
of
reach
and
there
were
too
many
people
in
the
place
for
any
attempt
by
climbing
on
the
counter
josh
grew
savage
and
soured
plastering
itself
was
not
such
troublesome
work
and
at
least
the
pay
was
certain
it
was
little
short
of
ten
when
he
left
the
and
turned
back
toward
canonbury
he
would
have
on
the
way
he
resolved
and
he
would
catch
the
first
train
home
he
would
have
to
knock
somebody
over
in
a
dark
street
that
was
all
it
was
nothing
new
but
he
would
rather
have
made
his
click
another
way
this
time
because
his
tender
ankle
might
keep
him
slow
or
even
give
way
altogether
and
to
be
caught
in
a
robbery
with
violence
might
easily
mean
something
more
than
mere
imprisonment
it
might
mean
a
dose
of
the
and
the
cat
was
a
thing
the
thought
or
the
mention
whereof
sent
shudders
through
the
old
jago
but
no
nobody
worth
knocking
down
came
his
way
truly
luck
was
out
there
was
a
spot
by
the
long
garden
wall
of
a
corner
house
that
would
have
suited
admirably
and
as
josh
lingered
there
and
looked
about
him
his
eye
fell
on
a
ladder
reared
nearly
upright
against
the
back
wall
of
that
same
corner
house
and
lashed
at
the
roof
it
passed
by
the
side
of
the
second
floor
window
whereof
the
top
sash
was
a
little
open
that
would
do
it
was
not
his
usual
line
of
work
but
it
looked
very
promising
he
stuck
his
stick
under
his
waistcoat
by
way
of
the
collar
and
climbed
the
wall
with
gingerly
care
giving
his
sound
foot
all
the
hard
work
the
ladder
offered
no
difficulty
but
the
bottom
sash
of
the
window
was
stiff
and
he
cracked
a
pane
of
glass
in
pushing
at
the
frame
with
his
stick
the
sash
lifted
however
in
the
end
and
he
climbed
into
the
dark
room
being
much
impeded
by
the
all
was
quiet
in
the
house
and
the
ticking
of
a
watch
on
the
was
distinct
in
the
ear
josh
felt
for
it
and
found
it
with
a
chain
hanging
from
the
bow
the
house
was
uncommonly
quiet
could
it
possibly
be
a
dead
after
all
josh
felt
that
he
ought
to
have
inspected
the
front
windows
before
climbing
the
wall
but
the
excitement
of
the
chance
had
ruined
his
discretion
at
any
rate
he
would
reconnoitre
the
door
was
ajar
and
the
landing
was
dark
down
in
the
a
gross
pimply
man
in
and
socks
sat
up
on
the
sofa
at
the
sound
of
an
opened
window
higher
in
the
house
he
took
a
drink
from
the
glass
by
his
side
and
listened
then
he
rose
and
went
softly
upstairs
josh
perrott
came
out
on
the
landing
it
was
a
long
landing
with
a
staircase
at
the
end
illuminated
from
somewhere
below
so
that
it
was
not
a
case
of
a
dead
after
all
he
along
to
take
a
look
down
the
stairs
nevertheless
then
he
was
conscious
of
a
loud
breathing
as
of
an
cow
and
up
behind
the
rose
a
fat
head
followed
by
a
fat
trunk
between
white
josh
sank
into
the
shadow
the
man
had
no
light
but
discover
him
he
must
sooner
or
later
for
the
landing
was
narrow
better
sooner
and
suddenly
as
the
man
foot
was
on
the
topmost
stair
josh
sprang
at
him
with
a
straight
that
took
him
on
the
broad
chin
and
sent
him
downstairs
in
a
heap
with
a
crash
and
a
roar
josh
darted
back
to
the
room
he
had
just
left
scrambled
through
the
window
and
slid
down
the
ladder
as
he
had
slid
down
many
another
when
he
was
a
boy
he
checked
himself
short
of
the
bottom
sprang
at
the
flung
himself
over
and
ran
up
the
dark
with
the
sound
of
muffled
roars
and
screams
faint
in
his
ears
he
ran
a
street
or
two
taking
every
corner
as
he
came
to
it
and
then
fell
into
a
walk
in
his
flight
he
had
not
spared
his
ankle
and
now
it
was
painful
moreover
he
had
left
his
stick
behind
him
in
the
bedroom
but
he
was
in
highbury
and
canonbury
road
station
was
less
than
half
a
mile
away
he
grinned
silently
as
he
went
for
there
was
something
in
the
aspect
of
the
overfed
householder
and
in
the
manner
of
his
downfall
that
gave
the
adventure
a
comic
flavour
he
took
a
peep
at
his
spoil
as
he
passed
under
a
street
lamp
for
all
watches
and
chains
are
the
same
in
the
dark
and
the
thing
might
be
a
mere
waterbury
on
a
steel
guard
but
no
both
were
gold
and
heavy
a
red
clock
and
slang
if
ever
there
was
one
and
so
josh
perrott
hobbled
and
chuckled
his
way
home
xxiv
but
indeed
josh
perrott
luck
was
worse
than
he
thought
for
the
gross
pimply
man
was
a
high
mobsman
so
very
high
a
mobsman
that
it
would
have
been
slander
and
libel
and
a
very
great
expense
to
write
him
down
a
mobsman
at
all
he
paid
a
rent
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
a
year
and
heavy
rates
and
put
into
the
plate
at
a
very
respectable
chapel
every
sunday
he
was
in
fact
the
king
of
high
mobsmen
spoken
of
among
them
as
the
mogul
he
did
no
vulgar
thievery
he
never
screwed
a
chat
nor
claimed
a
peter
nor
worked
the
mace
he
sat
easily
at
home
and
financed
sometimes
planned
promising
speculations
a
large
swindle
requiring
much
and
preliminary
outlay
or
a
robbery
of
specie
from
a
mail
train
or
a
bank
fraud
needing
organization
and
funds
when
the
results
of
such
speculations
consisted
of
money
he
took
the
lion
share
when
they
were
expressed
in
terms
of
imprisonment
they
fell
to
active
and
intelligent
subordinates
so
that
for
years
the
mogul
had
lived
an
affluent
and
a
blameless
life
far
removed
from
the
necessity
of
injudicious
bodily
exercise
and
characterised
by
every
indulgence
consistent
with
a
proper
suburban
respectability
he
had
patronised
snubbed
or
encouraged
high
mobsmen
of
more
temerarious
habit
had
profited
by
their
exploits
and
had
read
of
their
convictions
and
sentences
with
placid
interest
in
the
morning
papers
and
after
all
this
to
be
robbed
in
his
own
house
and
knocked
downstairs
by
a
casual
buster
was
an
outrage
that
afflicted
the
mogul
with
wrath
infuriate
because
that
was
a
sort
of
trouble
that
had
never
seemed
a
possibility
to
a
person
of
his
eminence
and
because
the
angriest
victim
of
dishonesty
is
a
thief
however
the
burglar
had
got
clean
away
that
was
plain
and
he
had
taken
the
best
watch
and
chain
in
the
house
with
the
mogul
initials
on
the
back
so
that
respectable
sufferer
sent
for
the
police
and
gave
his
attention
to
the
the
alleviation
of
bumps
and
the
washing
away
of
blood
in
his
bodily
condition
a
light
blow
was
enough
to
let
a
great
deal
of
blood
no
doubt
with
benefit
and
josh
perrott
blows
were
not
light
in
any
case
so
it
came
to
pass
that
not
only
were
the
police
on
the
for
a
man
with
a
large
gold
watch
with
the
mogul
monogram
on
the
back
but
also
the
word
was
passed
as
by
telegraph
through
underground
channels
till
every
fence
in
london
was
warned
that
the
watch
was
the
mogul
and
ere
noon
next
day
there
was
not
one
but
would
as
lief
have
put
a
scorpion
in
his
pocket
as
that
same
toy
and
tackle
that
josh
perrott
was
gloating
over
in
his
back
room
in
old
jago
street
as
for
josh
his
ankle
was
bad
in
the
morning
and
swelled
he
dabbed
at
it
perseveringly
with
wet
rags
and
rubbed
it
vigorously
so
that
by
one
he
was
able
to
lace
up
his
boot
and
go
out
he
was
anxious
to
fence
his
plunder
without
delay
and
he
made
his
way
to
hoxton
the
watch
seemed
to
be
something
especially
good
and
he
determined
to
stand
out
for
a
price
well
above
the
usual
figure
for
the
swag
of
common
thieves
commanded
no
such
prices
as
did
that
of
the
high
mob
all
of
it
was
bought
and
sold
on
the
simple
system
first
called
into
being
seventy
years
back
and
more
by
the
prince
of
fences
ikey
solomons
a
brought
a
fixed
sum
good
or
bad
and
a
roll
of
cloth
brought
the
fixed
price
of
a
roll
of
cloth
regardless
of
quality
thus
a
silver
watch
fetched
six
shillings
never
more
and
never
less
a
gold
watch
was
worth
twice
as
much
an
uncommonly
good
one
a
rich
man
watch
would
bring
as
much
as
eighteen
shillings
if
the
thief
were
judge
enough
of
its
quality
to
venture
the
demand
and
as
it
commonly
took
three
men
to
secure
a
single
watch
in
the
open
street
one
to
one
to
snatch
and
a
third
to
take
from
the
snatcher
the
gains
of
the
trade
were
poor
except
to
the
fence
this
time
josh
resolved
to
put
pressure
on
the
fence
and
to
do
his
best
to
get
something
as
near
a
sovereign
as
might
be
and
as
to
the
chain
so
thick
and
heavy
he
would
fight
his
best
for
the
privilege
of
sale
by
weight
thus
turning
the
thing
in
his
mind
he
entered
the
familiar
doorway
of
the
old
clothes
shop
is
id
asked
the
fence
holding
out
his
hand
with
the
customary
air
of
contempt
for
what
was
coming
by
way
of
discounting
it
in
advance
this
particular
fence
never
bought
anything
himself
he
inspected
whatever
was
brought
on
behalf
of
an
occult
friend
and
the
transaction
was
completed
by
a
shabby
third
party
in
an
adjoining
court
but
he
had
an
amazingly
keen
regard
for
his
interests
josh
put
the
watch
into
the
extended
hand
the
fence
lifted
it
to
his
face
turned
it
over
and
started
he
looked
hard
at
josh
and
then
again
at
the
watch
and
handed
it
hastily
back
holding
it
gingerly
by
the
bow
vant
he
said
me
nod
i
mean
no
no
he
turned
away
shaking
his
hand
as
though
to
throw
off
contamination
id
avay
the
matter
josh
demanded
astonished
it
o
the
letters
on
the
back
you
can
easy
send
it
to
church
ca
ye
a
watch
is
to
church
when
it
is
put
into
another
case
but
the
fence
waved
away
the
suggestion
id
avay
i
tell
you
he
said
vo
nodden
to
do
vid
id
the
matter
with
the
chain
then
asked
josh
but
the
fence
walked
away
to
the
back
of
the
shop
wagging
his
hands
desperately
like
a
wet
man
seeking
a
towel
and
repeating
only
to
do
vid
id
take
id
avay
nodden
to
do
vid
id
josh
stuffed
his
prize
back
into
his
pocket
and
regained
the
street
he
was
confounded
what
was
wrong
with
cohen
did
he
suspect
a
police
trick
to
entrap
him
josh
snorted
with
indignation
at
the
thought
he
was
no
nark
but
perhaps
the
police
were
showing
a
pressing
interest
in
business
concerns
just
now
and
he
had
suspended
fencing
for
a
while
the
guess
was
a
lame
one
but
he
could
think
of
none
better
at
the
moment
as
he
pushed
his
way
to
the
jago
he
would
try
mother
gapp
mother
gapp
would
not
even
take
the
watch
in
her
hands
her
eyes
were
good
enough
at
that
distance
josh
perrott
she
said
ye
bin
up
to
now

to
git

do
ye

breakin

a

widder
that
way
ai
ye
you
git
out
go
on
i
o
you
it
was
very
extraordinary
was
there
a
general
reclamation
of
fences
but
there
were
men
at
work
at
the
feathers
putting
down
boards
and
restoring
partitions
and
two
of
them
had
been
over
ruinously
on
their
way
to
work
and
now
they
came
and
went
with
four
policemen
possibly
mother
gapp
feared
the
observation
of
carpenters
be
it
as
it
might
there
was
nothing
for
it
now
but
weech
mr
weech
was
charmed
me
it
a
wonderful
fine
watch
mr
perrott
a
wonderful
fine
watch
an
a
beautiful
chain
but
he
was
looking
narrowly
at
the
big
monogram
as
he
said
it
reely
a
wonderful
article
they
do
git
up
to
be
sure

a
lot
money
too
i
be
bound
might
you
be

replied
josh
wot

it
for

a
lovely
watch
mr

a
watch
an
the
chain
matches
it
but
you
must
be
too
on
me
shall
we
say
four
pound
for
the
little
lot
it
was
more
than
double
josh
wildest
hopes
but
he
wanted
all
he
could
get
he
said
doggedly
weech
gazed
at
him
with
tender
rebuke
pound
a
awful
lot
money
mr
perrott
he
said
too
on
me
reely
i
know
i

scrape

up
but

beautiful
little
lot
an
i

sich
a
mr
perrott
bring

round
mornin
at
eleven
i
come
five
quid
mind
yus
answered
mr
weech
with
a
reproving
smile
reely
more
than
i
ought
josh
was
jubilant
and
forgot
his
sore
ankle
he
had
never
handled
such
a
sum
as
five
pounds
since
his
fight
with
billy
leary
years
ago
when
indeed
he
had
stooped
to
folly
in
the
shape
of
lavish
treating
and
so
had
not
enjoyed
the
handling
of
the
full
amount
mr
weech
also
was
pleased
for
it
was
a
great
stroke
of
business
to
oblige
so
distinguished
a
person
as
the
mogul
there
was
no
telling
what
advantages
it
might
not
lead
to
in
the
way
of
trade
that
night
the
perrotts
had
a
hot
supper
brought
from
in
paper
and
at
eleven
the
next
morning
josh
twenty
yards
from
mr
weech
door
with
the
watch
and
chain
in
his
pocket
was
tapped
on
the
arm
by
a
constable
in
plain
clothes
while
another
came
up
on
the
other
side
perrott
said
the
first
constable
cheerily
got
a
little
business
with
you
at
the
station
wot
for
well
come
along
it
ai
anything
unless
there
a
gold
watch
an
chain
on
you
from
highbury
it
just
a
turnin
over
replied
josh
resignedly
a
fair
cop
i
go
quiet
right
perrott
it
ai
no
good
playin
the
fool
you
know
they
were
moving
along
and
as
they
came
by
weech
shop
a
whiskered
face
with
a
patch
of
shining
scalp
over
it
peeped
from
behind
a
curtain
that
hung
at
the
rear
of
the
bloaters
and
plumcake
in
the
window
as
he
saw
it
josh
ducked
suddenly
wrenching
his
arm
free
and
dashed
over
the
threshold
mr
weech
whiskers
and
apron
flying
galloped
through
the
door
at
the
back
and
the
constables
sprang
upon
josh
instantly
and
dragged
him
into
the
street
mean
cried
the
one
who
knew
him
indignantly
and
with
a
significant
glance
at
the
other
that
goin
quiet
josh
face
was
white
and
staring
with
rage
he
grunted
through
his
shut
teeth
after
a
pause
go
quiet
now
i
ai
got
nothin
agin
xxv
dicky
morning
theft
that
day
had
been
but
a
small
one
he
had
run
off
with
a
new
rule
that
a
had
carelessly
left
on
an
unfinished
office
table
at
his
shop
door
in
curtain
road
it
was
not
much
but
it
might
fetch
some
sort
of
a
dinner
at
weech
which
would
be
better
than
going
home
and
perhaps
finding
nothing
so
about
noon
all
ignorant
of
his
father
misfortune
he
came
by
way
of
holywell
lane
and
bethnal
green
road
to
meakin
street
mr
weech
looked
at
him
rather
oddly
dicky
fancied
when
he
came
in
but
he
took
the
rule
with
alacrity
and
brought
dicky
a
rasher
of
bacon
and
a
slice
of
cake
afterward
this
seemed
very
generous
more
mr
weech
manner
was
uncommonly
amiable
and
when
the
meal
was
over
of
his
own
motion
he
handed
over
a
supplementary
penny
dicky
was
surprised
but
he
had
no
objection
and
he
thought
little
more
about
it
as
soon
as
he
appeared
in
luck
row
he
was
told
that
his
father
had
been
indeed
the
tidings
had
filled
the
jago
within
ten
minutes
josh
perrott
was
walking
quietly
along
meakin
street
so
went
the
news
when
up
comes
snuffy
and
another
split
and
smugs
him
josh
had
a
go
for
weech
door
to
cut
his
lucky
out
at
the
back
but
was
caught
that
was
a
smart
notion
of
josh
the
jago
opinion
ran
to
get
through
weech
and
out
into
the
courts
behind
but
it
was
no
go
hannah
perrott
sat
in
her
room
inert
and
lamenting
dicky
could
not
rouse
her
and
at
last
he
went
off
by
himself
to
reconnoitre
about
commercial
street
police
station
and
pick
up
what
information
he
might
while
a
gossip
or
two
came
and
took
mrs
perrott
for
consolation
to
mother
gapp
little
em
unwashed
tangled
and
weeping
could
well
take
care
of
herself
and
the
room
being
more
than
two
years
old
josh
perrott
would
be
brought
up
dicky
ascertained
at
the
north
london
police
court
so
the
next
morning
found
dicky
trudging
moodily
along
the
two
miles
of
flags
to
stoke
newington
road
while
his
mother
and
three
sympathising
friends
who
foresaw
an
opportunity
for
numerous
tiny
drops
with
interesting
circumstances
to
flavour
them
took
a
penny
cast
on
the
way
in
a
tramcar
dicky
with
some
doubt
as
to
the
disposition
of
the
policeman
toward
ragged
boys
waited
for
the
four
women
and
contrived
to
pass
in
unobserved
among
them
several
jagos
were
in
the
court
interested
not
only
in
josh
adventure
but
in
one
of
cocko
harnwell
who
had
indulged
the
night
before
in
an
animated
little
scramble
with
three
policemen
in
dalston
and
they
waited
with
sympathetic
interest
while
the
luck
was
settled
of
a
long
string
of
at
last
josh
was
brought
in
and
lurched
composedly
into
the
dock
in
the
manner
of
one
who
knew
the
routine
the
police
gave
evidence
of
arrest
in
consequence
of
information
received
and
of
finding
the
watch
and
chain
in
josh
trousers
pocket
the
prosecutor
with
his
head
conspicuously
bedight
with
puffed
and
grunted
up
into
the
kissed
the
book
and
was
a
commission
agent
he
positively
identified
the
watch
and
chain
and
he
not
less
positively
identified
josh
perrott
whom
he
had
picked
out
from
a
score
of
men
in
the
this
would
have
been
a
feat
indeed
for
a
man
who
had
never
seen
josh
and
had
only
once
encountered
his
fist
in
the
dark
had
it
not
been
for
the
dutiful
though
private
aid
of
mr
weech
who
in
giving
his
information
had
described
josh
and
his
one
suit
of
clothes
with
great
fidelity
especially
indicating
a
scar
on
the
right
which
would
mark
him
among
a
thousand
the
retired
commission
agent
was
quite
sure
of
the
prisoner
he
had
met
him
on
the
stairs
where
there
was
plenty
of
light
from
a
lamp
and
the
prisoner
had
attacked
him
savagely
beating
him
about
the
head
and
flinging
him
downstairs
the
policeman
called
by
the
prosecutor
servant
deposed
to
finding
the
prosecutor
bruised
and
bleeding
there
was
a
ladder
against
the
back
of
the
house
a
bedroom
window
had
been
opened
there
were
muddy
marks
on
the
sill
and
he
had
found
the
stick
produced
lying
in
the
bedroom
josh
leaned
easily
on
the
rail
before
him
while
evidence
was
being
given
and
said
yer
worship
whenever
he
was
asked
if
he
desired
to
question
a
witness
he
knew
better
than
to
run
the
risk
of
incriminating
himself
by
challenging
the
prosecutor
evidence
and
as
it
was
a
certain
case
of
committal
for
trial
it
would
have
been
useless
in
any
event
he
made
the
same
reply
when
he
was
asked
if
he
had
anything
to
say
before
being
committed
and
straightway
was
he
lurched
serenely
out
of
the
dock
waving
his
cap
at
his
friends
in
the
court
and
that
was
all
the
jagos
waited
till
cocko
harnwell
got
his
three
months
and
then
retired
to
neighbouring
but
dicky
remembered
his
little
sister
and
hurried
home
the
month
session
at
the
old
bailey
had
just
begun
so
that
josh
had
no
long
stay
at
holloway
among
the
jagos
it
was
held
to
be
a
most
creditable
circumstance
that
josh
was
to
take
his
trial
with
full
honours
at
the
old
bailey
and
not
at
mere
county
sessions
at
clerkenwell
like
a
simple
or
for
josh
was
a
case
of
burglary
with
serious
violence
such
as
was
fitting
for
the
old
bailey
and
not
even
a
high
mobsman
could
come
to
trial
with
greater
glory
like
as
not
it
laggin
dues
after
other
convictions
said
bill
rann
and
jerry
gullen
thought
so
too
dicky
went
with
his
mother
and
em
to
see
josh
at
newgate
they
stood
with
other
visitors
very
noisy
before
a
double
iron
railing
covered
with
at
the
farther
side
whereof
stood
josh
and
other
prisoners
while
a
screaming
hubbub
of
question
and
answer
filled
the
air
josh
had
little
to
say
he
lounged
against
the
farther
railing
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
asked
what
cocko
harnwell
had
got
and
sent
a
message
to
bill
rann
while
his
wife
did
little
more
than
look
dolefully
through
the
wires
and
pipe
josh
wotever
shall
i
do
at
intervals
with
no
particular
emotion
while
em
pressed
her
smudgy
little
face
against
the
wires
and
stared
mightily
and
while
dicky
felt
that
if
he
had
been
younger
he
would
have
cried
when
time
was
up
josh
waved
his
hand
and
slouched
off
and
his
family
turned
out
with
the
rest
little
em
carrying
into
later
years
a
memory
of
father
as
a
man
who
lived
in
a
cage
in
such
a
case
as
this
the
jago
would
have
been
for
ever
disgraced
if
josh
perrott
pals
had
neglected
to
get
up
a
or
subscription
to
pay
for
his
defence
things
were
never
very
flourishing
in
the
jago
but
this
was
the
sort
of
break
a
jago
could
not
shirk
lest
it
were
remembered
against
him
when
his
own
turn
came
so
enough
was
collected
to
brief
an
exceedingly
junior
counsel
who
did
his
useless
best
but
the
facts
were
too
strong
even
for
the
most
inexperienced
advocate
the
evidence
of
the
prosecutor
was
nowhere
to
be
shaken
and
the
jury
found
a
verdict
of
guilty
without
leaving
the
box
indeed
with
scarce
the
formality
of
collecting
their
heads
together
over
the
rails
then
past
was
most
unpleasantly
raked
up
before
him
he
had
been
convicted
of
larceny
of
assaulting
the
police
and
of
robbery
with
violence
there
were
two
sentences
of
six
months
imprisonment
recorded
against
him
one
of
three
months
and
two
of
a
month
besides
fines
the
recorder
considered
it
a
very
serious
offence
not
deterred
by
the
punishments
he
had
already
received
the
prisoner
had
proceeded
to
a
worse
crime
burglary
and
with
violence
it
was
plain
that
lenience
was
wasted
in
such
a
case
and
simple
imprisonment
was
not
enough
there
must
be
an
exemplary
sentence
the
prisoner
must
be
kept
in
penal
servitude
for
five
years
lagging
dues
it
was
as
bill
rann
had
anticipated
that
josh
perrott
agreed
with
him
was
suggested
by
the
fact
that
from
the
very
beginning
he
described
himself
as
a
painter
because
a
painter
in
prison
is
apt
to
be
employed
at
times
in
painting
a
lighter
and
a
more
desirable
task
than
falls
to
the
lot
of
his
fellows
in
other
trades
in
a
room
by
the
court
josh
saw
his
wife
dicky
and
bill
rann
for
the
occasion
before
his
ride
to
holloway
his
one
stopping
place
on
the
way
to
chelmsford
gaol
little
em
had
been
left
sprawling
in
the
jago
gutters
this
time
hannah
perrott
wept
in
good
earnest
and
dicky
notwithstanding
his
thirteen
years
blinked
very
hard
at
the
wall
before
him
the
arrangement
of
josh
affairs
was
neither
a
long
nor
a
difficult
labour
you
to
do
wot
you
can
with
rush
bags
an
sacks
and
an
wot
not
he
said
to
his
wife
and
she
assented
josh
nodded
if
you
to
go
in
the
he
meant
the
workhouse
it
ca
be
you
be
no
wuss
auf
me
be
awright
said
bill
rann
jerking
his
thumb
cheerfully
toward
the
missis
about
you
think
they
make
it
parkhurst
josh
shook
his
head
moodily
parkhurst
being
the
prison
reserved
for
convicts
of
less
robust
habit
he
had
little
hope
of
enjoying
its
easier
conditions
presently
he
said
bin
put
away
this
time
fair
put
away
answered
bill
dues
is
it
josh
nodded
done
it
then
narked
josh
shook
his
head
mind
he
said
do
want
druv
out
o
the
jago
i
come
out
i
be
sorry
to
miss
know
that
enough
and
then
time
was
up
josh
suffered
the
missis
to
kiss
him
and
shook
hands
with
bill
rann
luck
to
all
you
jagos
he
said
dicky
shook
hands
too
and
said
father
in
a
voice
of
such
laboured
cheerfulness
that
a
grin
burst
for
a
moment
amid
josh
moody
features
as
he
was
marched
away
and
so
departed
for
the
place
in
jago
idiom
where
the
dogs
do
bite
xxvi
it
was
father
sturt
practice
to
visit
every
family
in
his
parish
in
regular
order
but
small
as
the
parish
was
insignificant
indeed
in
mere
area
its
population
exceeded
eight
thousand
so
that
the
round
was
one
of
many
months
for
visiting
was
but
one
among
innumerable
duties
but
josh
perrott
lagging
secured
his
family
a
special
call
not
that
the
circumstances
were
in
any
way
novel
or
at
all
uncommon
nor
even
that
the
vicar
had
any
hope
of
being
able
to
help
he
was
but
the
one
man
who
could
swim
in
a
howling
sea
of
human
wreckage
in
the
jago
wives
like
hannah
perrott
temporarily
widowed
by
the
absence
of
husbands
the
country
were
to
be
counted
in
scores
and
most
were
in
worse
case
than
she
in
the
matter
of
dependent
children
father
sturt
revealed
the
fact
that
in
old
jago
street
alone
near
seventy
of
the
males
were
at
that
moment
on
in
the
perrott
case
indeed
the
sufferers
were
fortunate
as
things
went
mrs
perrott
had
but
herself
and
the
child
of
two
to
keep
for
dicky
could
do
something
whether
good
or
bad
for
himself
the
vicar
might
try
to
get
regular
work
for
dicky
but
it
would
be
a
vain
toil
for
he
must
tell
an
employer
what
he
knew
of
dicky
past
and
of
that
other
situation
he
could
but
give
the
woman
the
best
counsel
at
his
command
and
do
what
he
might
to
quicken
any
latent
spark
of
energy
so
he
did
his
best
and
that
was
all
the
struggle
lay
with
hannah
perrott
she
had
been
left
before
and
more
than
once
but
then
the
periods
had
been
shorter
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
things
had
fallen
out
so
well
that
scarce
more
than
a
meal
here
and
there
had
had
to
be
missed
though
when
they
came
the
meals
were
apt
to
be
but
of
crusts
and
now
there
was
more
trouble
ahead
for
though
she
began
her
lonely
time
with
but
one
small
child
on
hand
she
knew
that
ere
long
there
would
be
two
of
course
she
had
worked
before
not
only
when
josh
had
been
but
at
other
times
to
add
to
the
family
resources
she
was
a
clumsy
needlewoman
else
she
might
hope
to
earn
some
ninepence
or
a
shilling
a
day
at
making
shirts
by
keeping
well
to
the
needle
for
sixteen
hours
out
of
the
and
from
the
whole
sum
there
would
be
no
deductions
except
for
needles
and
cotton
and
what
the
frugal
employer
might
choose
to
subtract
for
work
to
which
he
could
devise
an
objection
but
as
it
was
she
must
do
her
best
to
get
some
they
paid
one
and
sevenpence
a
hundred
for
sacks
and
with
speed
and
long
hours
she
could
make
a
hundred
in
four
days
rush
would
bring
even
more
which
would
be
desirable
considering
the
a
week
for
rent
which
with
the
payments
for
other
rooms
made
the
rent
of
the
crazy
den
in
old
jago
street
about
equal
space
for
space
to
that
of
a
house
in
onslow
square
then
there
was
a
more
lucrative
employment
still
but
one
to
be
looked
for
at
intervals
only
one
not
to
be
counted
on
at
all
in
fact
for
it
was
a
prize
and
many
sought
after
it
this
was
the
making
of
for
making
one
hundred
and
outside
cases
with
paper
label
and
sandpaper
and
the
same
number
of
trays
to
slide
into
them
a
gross
of
complete
boxes
or
two
hundred
and
pieces
in
all
one
got
twopence
farthing
indeed
for
a
special
size
one
even
got
a
farthing
a
gross
more
and
all
the
wood
and
the
labels
and
the
sandpaper
were
provided
free
so
that
the
fortunate
operative
lost
nothing
out
of
the
twopence
farthing
but
the
cost
of
the
paste
and
the
string
for
tying
up
the
boxes
into
regularly
numbered
batches
and
the
time
employed
in
fetching
the
work
and
taking
it
back
again
and
if
seven
gross
were
to
be
got
and
could
be
done
in
a
day
and
it
was
really
not
very
difficult
for
the
skilful
hand
who
kept
at
work
long
enough
the
day
income
was
one
and
threepence
less
expenses
still
better
that
than
the
shirts
but
the
work
was
hard
to
get
as
the
manufacturers
complained
people
would
buy
swedish
matches
whereas
if
people
would
support
home
industries
and
buy
no
matches
but
theirs
they
would
be
able
to
order
many
a
of
boxes
more
there
might
be
collateral
sources
of
income
but
these
were
doubtful
and
irregular
probably
dicky
would
bring
in
a
few
coppers
now
and
again
then
judicious
attendance
at
churches
chapels
and
beyond
the
jago
borders
was
rewarded
by
boots
and
the
like
it
was
necessary
to
know
just
where
and
when
to
go
and
what
to
say
else
the
sole
result
might
be
loss
of
time
there
was
a
church
in
bethnal
green
for
instance
which
it
would
be
foolish
to
enter
before
the
end
of
the
litany
for
then
you
were
in
good
time
to
get
your
hundredweight
of
coals
but
at
other
places
they
might
object
to
so
late
an
appearance
above
all
one
must
know
the
ropes
there
were
several
women
in
the
jago
who
made
almost
a
living
in
this
way
alone
they
were
experts
they
knew
every
fund
every
all
the
comings
and
goings
of
the
gullible
insomuch
that
they
would
take
black
umbrage
at
any
unexpected
difficulty
in
getting
what
they
demanded
one
would
say
to
pitch
sich
a
tale
i
earned
it
twice
over
but
these
were
the
proficient
and
proficiency
in
the
trade
was
an
outcome
of
long
experience
working
on
a
foundation
of
natural
gifts
and
hannah
perrott
could
never
hope
to
be
among
them
turning
these
things
in
her
mind
she
addressed
herself
to
her
struggle
she
managed
to
get
some
sacks
but
for
a
week
or
two
she
could
make
nothing
like
a
day
though
dicky
helped
her
fingers
got
raw
but
she
managed
to
complete
a
hundred
within
the
first
week
they
might
have
been
better
done
as
the
employer
said
when
he
saw
them
but
she
got
her
full
one
and
sevenpence
she
pawned
her
boots
for
fourpence
and
wore
two
old
odd
ones
of
josh
and
she
got
twopence
on
a
petticoat
dicky
also
helped
a
little
and
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
there
came
a
godsend
in
the
shape
of
material
for
mrs
perrott
was
slow
with
them
at
first
but
dicky
was
quick
and
even
little
em
began
to
learn
to
spread
paste
xxvii
dicky
grew
slighter
and
lanker
dark
about
the
eyes
and
weaker
he
was
growing
longitudinally
and
that
made
his
lateral
wasting
the
quicker
and
the
more
apparent
a
furtive
frighted
look
hung
ever
in
his
face
a
fugitive
air
about
his
whole
person
his
mother
long
face
was
longer
than
ever
and
blacker
under
the
eyes
than
dicky
own
and
her
weak
open
mouth
hung
at
the
corners
as
that
of
a
woman
faint
with
weeping
little
em
knees
and
elbows
were
knobs
in
the
midst
of
limbs
of
unnatural
length
rarely
could
a
meal
be
seen
ahead
and
when
it
came
it
made
dicky
doubtful
whether
or
not
hunger
were
really
caused
by
eating
but
his
chief
distress
was
to
see
that
little
em
cried
not
like
a
child
but
silently
as
she
strove
to
thread
needles
or
to
smear
matchbox
labels
and
when
good
fortune
brought
there
was
an
undue
loss
on
the
twopence
farthing
in
the
matter
of
paste
the
stuff
was
a
foul
mess
sour
and
faint
and
it
was
kept
in
a
broken
near
which
dicky
had
detected
his
sister
sucking
her
fingers
for
in
truth
little
em
stole
the
paste
on
and
off
by
one
way
and
another
mrs
perrott
made
enough
to
keep
the
rent
paid
with
indifferent
regularity
and
sometimes
there
was
a
copper
or
so
left
over
she
did
fairly
well
too
at
the
churches
and
people
saw
her
condition
and
now
and
again
would
give
her
something
beyond
the
common
dole
so
that
she
learned
the
trick
of
looking
more
miserable
than
usual
at
such
places
the
roof
provided
dicky
felt
that
his
was
the
task
to
find
food
alone
he
might
have
rubbed
along
clear
of
starvation
but
there
were
his
mother
and
his
sister
lack
of
victuals
shook
his
nerve
and
made
him
timid
moreover
his
terror
grew
greater
than
ever
at
the
prospect
of
being
caught
in
a
theft
he
lay
awake
at
night
and
sweated
to
think
of
it
who
would
bring
in
things
from
the
outer
world
for
mother
and
em
then
and
the
danger
was
worse
than
ever
he
had
felt
the
birch
and
it
was
bad
very
bad
but
he
would
take
it
every
day
and
take
it
almost
without
a
tear
rather
than
the
chance
of
a
reformatory
magistrates
were
unwilling
to
send
boys
to
reformatories
while
both
father
and
mother
were
at
hand
to
control
them
for
that
were
relieving
the
parents
of
their
natural
responsibility
but
in
a
case
like
dicky
a
was
a
very
likely
thing
so
that
dicky
as
he
prowled
was
torn
between
implacable
need
and
the
fear
of
being
cut
off
from
all
chance
of
supplying
it
it
was
his
rule
never
to
come
home
without
bringing
something
were
it
no
more
than
a
mildewed
crust
it
was
a
resolve
impossible
to
keep
at
times
but
at
those
times
it
was
two
in
the
morning
ere
he
would
drag
himself
pallid
and
faint
into
the
dark
room
where
the
others
might
be
probably
were
lying
awake
and
unfed
rather
than
face
such
a
homecoming
he
had
sometimes
ventured
on
a
more
difficult
feat
than
stealing
in
the
outer
world
he
had
stolen
in
the
jago
sam
cash
for
instance
had
lost
a
bloater
dicky
never
ate
at
weech
now
rarely
indeed
would
he
take
payment
in
kind
unless
it
were
for
something
of
smaller
value
than
the
average
of
his
poor
pilferings
and
then
he
carried
the
food
home
but
cheaper
things
could
be
bought
elsewhere
so
that
more
usually
he
insisted
on
money
payments
to
the
grief
of
mr
weech
who
set
forth
the
odiousness
of
ingratitude
at
length
though
his
homilies
had
no
sort
of
effect
on
dicky
morals
father
sturt
saw
that
hannah
perrott
gained
no
ground
in
her
struggle
and
urged
her
to
apply
for
outdoor
parish
relief
promising
to
second
her
request
with
the
guardians
but
with
an
odd
throwback
to
the
respectability
of
her
ancestry
she
disliked
the
notion
of
help
from
the
parish
and
preferred
to
remain
as
she
was
for
there
at
least
her
ingrained
inertness
seemed
to
side
with
some
phantom
of
to
her
present
position
she
had
subsided
by
almost
imperceptible
degrees
and
she
was
scarce
conscious
of
a
change
but
to
parish
relief
there
was
a
distinct
and
palpable
step
a
step
that
on
the
whole
it
seemed
easier
not
to
take
but
it
was
with
eagerness
that
she
took
a
maternity
society
letter
wherewith
the
vicar
had
provided
himself
on
her
behalf
for
her
time
was
drawing
near
xxviii
josh
perrott
well
understood
the
advantage
of
good
and
after
six
months
in
his
chelmsford
cell
he
had
earned
the
right
to
a
visit
from
friends
but
none
came
he
had
scarcely
expected
that
anybody
would
and
asked
for
the
order
merely
on
the
general
principle
that
a
man
should
take
all
he
can
get
useful
or
not
for
there
would
have
been
a
five
shilling
fare
to
pay
for
each
visitor
from
london
and
hannah
perrott
could
as
easily
have
paid
five
pounds
and
indeed
she
had
other
things
to
think
of
kiddo
cook
had
been
less
observed
of
late
in
the
jago
in
simple
fact
he
was
at
work
he
found
that
a
steady
week
of
porterage
at
spitalfields
market
would
bring
him
sixteen
shillings
and
perhaps
a
little
more
and
he
had
taken
father
sturt
encouragement
to
try
another
week
and
a
week
after
that
father
sturt
too
had
cunningly
stimulated
ambitions
till
he
cherished
aspirations
to
a
fruit
and
vegetable
stall
with
a
proper
tarpaulin
cover
for
bad
weather
though
he
cherished
them
in
secret
confident
that
they
were
of
his
own
independent
conception
perhaps
the
perrotts
saw
as
much
of
kiddo
as
did
anybody
at
this
time
for
kiddo
seeing
how
it
went
with
them
though
indeed
it
went
as
badly
with
others
too
built
up
laboriously
a
solemn
and
most
circumstantial
lie
there
was
a
friend
of
his
a
perfect
gentleman
who
used
a
by
spitalfields
market
and
who
had
just
started
an
extensive
and
complicated
business
in
the
general
provision
line
he
sold
all
sorts
of
fruit
and
vegetables
fresh
and
all
sorts
of
meat
carrots
cabbages
saveloys
fried
fish
and
cooked
his
motto
was
the
best
but
he
had
the
misfortune
to
be
quite
unable
himself
to
judge
whether
his
goods
were
really
of
the
best
or
not
in
consequence
of
an
injury
to
his
palate
arising
from
a
blow
on
the
mouth
with
a
quart
pot
inflicted
in
the
heat
of
discussion
by
a
wealthy
acquaintance
so
that
he
being
a
perfect
gentleman
had
requested
kiddo
cook
out
of
the
friendship
he
bore
him
to
drop
in
occasionally
and
test
his
samples
a
good
big
whack
you
know
said
he
get
the
advice
of
a
friend
or
two
if
ai
sure
so
kiddo
would
take
frequent
and
handsome
whacks
accordingly
to
the
perfect
gentleman
delight
and
not
quite
knowing
what
to
do
with
all
the
whacks
or
being
desirous
of
an
independent
opinion
on
them
there
was
some
confusion
between
these
two
motives
he
would
bring
mrs
perrott
samples
from
time
to
time
and
hope
it
would
inconvenience
her
it
never
did
it
was
late
in
the
dusk
of
a
rainy
day
that
kiddo
cook
stumped
into
old
jago
street
with
an
apple
in
his
pocket
for
em
it
was
not
much
but
money
was
a
little
short
and
at
any
rate
the
child
would
be
pleased
as
he
climbed
the
stairs
he
grew
conscious
of
sounds
of
anguish
muffled
by
the
perrotts
door
there
might
have
been
sobs
and
there
seemed
to
be
groans
certainly
little
em
was
crying
though
but
faintly
and
something
perhaps
scraped
on
the
boards
kiddo
hesitated
a
little
and
then
knocked
softly
the
knock
was
unnoticed
so
in
the
end
he
pushed
the
door
open
the
day
had
been
a
bad
one
with
the
perrotts
dicky
had
gone
out
early
and
had
not
returned
his
mother
had
tramped
unfed
to
the
sackmakers
but
there
was
no
work
to
be
got
she
tried
the
rush
bag
people
with
a
like
result
nor
was
any
matchbox
material
being
given
out
an
unregarded
turnip
had
rolled
from
a
shop
into
the
gutter
and
she
had
seized
it
stealthily
it
was
not
in
nature
to
take
it
home
whole
and
once
a
corner
was
cleared
she
dragged
herself
gnawing
the
root
furtively
as
she
went
and
so
she
joined
em
at
home
late
in
the
afternoon
kiddo
pushed
the
door
open
and
went
in
at
his
second
step
he
stood
staring
and
his
chin
dropped
gawd
said
kiddo
cook
he
cleared
the
stairs
in
three
jumps
he
stood
but
an
instant
on
the
flags
before
the
house
with
a
quick
glance
each
way
and
then
dashed
off
through
the
mud
pigeony
poll
was
erratic
in
residence
but
just
now
she
had
a
room
by
the
roof
of
a
house
in
jago
row
and
up
the
stairs
of
this
house
kiddo
ran
calling
her
by
name
over
to
perrotts
quick
he
shouted
from
the
landing
below
as
poll
appeared
at
her
door
for
gawd
sake
or
the
woman
croak
auf
to
father
and
he
rushed
away
to
the
vicar
lodgings
father
sturt
emerged
at
a
run
and
made
for
a
surgeon
in
shoreditch
high
street
and
when
the
surgeon
reached
hannah
perrott
he
found
her
stretched
on
her
ragged
bed
tended
with
anxious
clumsiness
by
pigeony
poll
while
little
em
tearful
and
abashed
sat
in
a
corner
and
nibbled
a
bit
of
turnip
hannah
perrott
had
anticipated
the
operation
of
the
maternity
society
letter
and
another
child
of
the
jago
had
come
unconsenting
into
its
black
inheritance
father
sturt
met
the
surgeon
as
he
came
away
in
the
later
evening
and
asked
if
all
were
well
the
surgeon
shrugged
his
shoulders
would
call
it
so
he
said
boy
alive
and
so
is
the
mother
but
you
and
i
may
say
the
truth
you
know
the
jago
far
better
than
i
is
there
a
child
in
all
this
place
that
would
be
better
dead
still
better
unborn
but
does
a
day
pass
without
bringing
you
just
such
a
parishioner
here
lies
the
jago
a
nest
of
rats
breeding
breeding
as
only
rats
can
and
we
say
it
is
well
on
high
moral
grounds
we
uphold
the
right
of
rats
to
multiply
their
thousands
sometimes
we
catch
a
rat
and
we
keep
it
a
little
while
nourish
it
carefully
and
put
it
back
into
the
nest
to
propagate
its
kind
father
sturt
walked
a
little
way
in
silence
then
he
said
are
right
of
course
but
who
listen
if
you
shout
it
from
the
housetops
i
might
try
to
proclaim
it
myself
if
i
had
time
and
energy
to
waste
but
i
have
none
i
must
work
and
so
must
you
the
burden
grows
day
by
day
as
you
say
the
thing
hopeless
perhaps
but
that
is
not
for
me
to
discuss
i
have
my
duty
the
surgeon
was
a
young
man
but
shoreditch
had
helped
him
over
most
of
his
enthusiasms
right
he
said
right
people
are
so
very
genteel
are
they
he
laughed
as
at
a
droll
remembrance
hang
it
all
men
like
ourselves
need
talk
as
though
the
world
was
built
of
hardbake
it
a
mighty
relief
to
speak
truth
with
a
man
who
knows
a
man
not
rotted
through
with
sentiment
think
how
few
men
we
trust
with
the
power
to
give
a
fellow
creature
a
year
in
gaol
and
how
carefully
we
pick
them
even
damnation
is
out
of
fashion
i
believe
among
theologians
but
any
noxious
wretch
may
damn
human
souls
to
the
jago
one
after
another
year
in
year
out
and
we
respect
his
right
his
sacred
right
at
the
the
two
men
separated
the
rain
which
had
abated
for
a
space
came
up
on
a
driving
wind
and
whipped
dicky
perrott
home
to
meet
his
new
brother
xxix
things
grew
a
little
easier
with
the
perrotts
father
sturt
saw
that
there
was
food
while
the
mother
was
renewing
her
strength
and
he
had
a
bag
of
linen
sent
more
he
carried
his
point
as
to
parish
relief
by
main
force
it
was
two
shillings
and
three
quartern
loaves
a
week
unfortunately
the
loaves
were
imprinted
with
the
parish
mark
or
they
might
have
been
sold
at
the
chandler
in
order
that
the
whole
measure
of
relief
might
be
passed
on
to
the
landlord
a
very
respectable
man
with
a
chandler
shop
of
his
own
for
rent
as
it
was
the
bread
perforce
was
eaten
and
the
landlord
had
the
two
shillings
as
well
as
eighteenpence
which
had
to
be
got
in
some
other
way
of
course
hannah
perrott
might
have
in
lodgers
in
the
room
as
others
did
but
she
doubted
her
ability
to
bully
the
rent
out
of
them
or
to
turn
them
out
if
they
did
not
pay
whatever
was
pawnable
had
gone
already
of
course
except
the
little
clock
that
might
have
produced
as
much
as
sixpence
but
she
had
a
whim
to
keep
it
she
regarded
it
as
a
memorial
of
josh
for
it
was
his
sole
contribution
to
the
family
appointments
dicky
with
a
jacket
from
the
vicar
store
took
to
hanging
about
liverpool
street
station
in
quest
of
bags
to
carry
sometimes
he
got
bags
and
coppers
for
carrying
them
sometimes
he
got
kicks
from
porters
an
hour
or
two
of
disappointment
in
this
pursuit
would
send
him
off
on
the
prowl
to
new
stock
for
mr
weech
he
went
farther
afield
now
to
the
in
mile
end
and
stepney
and
to
the
riverside
where
there
were
many
chances
guarded
jealously
however
by
the
pirate
boys
of
the
neighbourhood
who
would
tolerate
no
interlopers
at
the
wharves
in
the
very
early
morning
too
he
practised
the
fake
in
the
jago
for
there
were
those
among
the
jagos
who
kept
two
even
bred
linnets
and
such
birds
and
prepared
them
for
julking
or
singing
matches
at
the
bag
of
nails
it
was
the
habit
of
the
to
hang
their
little
wooden
cages
on
nails
out
of
window
and
there
they
hung
through
the
night
for
it
had
been
noted
as
a
surprising
peculiarity
in
linnets
that
a
bird
would
droop
and
go
off
song
after
a
dozen
or
so
of
nights
in
a
jago
room
in
company
with
eight
ten
or
a
dozen
human
sleepers
notwithstanding
the
thoughtful
shutting
of
windows
so
that
any
early
riser
provided
with
a
little
bag
packed
with
a
handful
or
so
of
sand
could
become
an
opulent
in
let
but
the
be
pitched
with
proper
skill
at
the
bottom
of
a
cage
and
that
cage
would
leave
the
nail
and
come
tumbling
and
fluttering
down
into
the
ready
hands
of
the
early
riser
the
brought
down
the
cage
and
fell
quietly
on
the
flags
which
was
why
it
was
preferred
before
a
stone
the
faker
was
moved
by
no
particular
love
of
linnets
his
spoil
was
got
rid
of
as
soon
as
the
opened
in
club
row
and
his
craft
was
one
of
danger
thus
the
months
went
with
dicky
and
the
years
there
were
changes
in
the
jago
the
baby
was
but
three
months
old
when
father
sturt
new
church
was
opened
and
the
club
set
going
in
new
buildings
and
it
was
at
that
time
that
josh
perrott
was
removed
to
portland
even
the
gradual
removal
of
the
old
jago
itself
was
begun
for
the
county
council
bought
a
row
of
houses
at
the
end
of
jago
row
by
honey
lane
with
a
design
to
build
big
barrack
dwellings
on
the
site
the
scenes
of
the
jago
court
eviction
were
repeated
with
less
governed
antics
for
the
county
council
knew
not
jago
ways
and
when
deputations
came
forth
weeping
protesting
the
impossibility
of
finding
new
lodgings
and
beseeching
a
respite
they
were
given
six
weeks
more
and
went
back
delighted
into
free
quarters
at
the
end
of
the
six
weeks
a
larger
deputation
protested
a
little
louder
wept
a
great
deal
more
and
poached
another
month
for
it
would
seem
an
unpopular
thing
to
turn
the
people
into
the
street
thus
in
the
end
when
the
unpopular
thing
had
to
be
done
it
was
with
sevenfold
trouble
loud
cursing
of
the
county
council
in
the
public
street
and
many
fights
but
this
one
spot
of
the
jago
cleared
the
county
council
began
to
creep
along
jago
row
and
into
half
jago
street
and
after
long
delay
the
crude
yellow
brick
of
the
barrack
dwellings
rose
above
the
hoardings
and
grew
storey
by
storey
dicky
was
fourteen
fifteen
sixteen
if
josh
perrott
had
only
earned
his
marks
he
would
soon
be
out
now
xxx
josh
perrott
earned
his
marks
and
in
less
than
four
years
from
his
conviction
he
came
away
from
portland
it
was
a
mere
matter
of
hours
ere
his
arrival
in
london
when
dicky
hands
in
pockets
strolled
along
old
jago
street
and
by
the
to
high
street
dicky
was
almost
at
his
seventeenth
birthday
he
had
grown
his
utmost
and
stood
five
feet
two
he
wore
a
cap
with
a
cloth
peak
and
tied
at
the
top
with
strings
kicksies
cut
saucy
and
a
coat
of
the
description
though
all
these
glories
were
torn
and
shabby
and
had
been
bought
he
was
safe
from
any
risk
of
the
reformatory
now
being
well
over
the
age
and
he
had
had
the
luck
never
to
have
been
taken
by
the
police
since
his
lagging
though
there
were
escapes
too
narrow
to
be
thought
about
with
comfort
it
was
a
matter
for
wonderment
and
he
spoke
of
it
with
pride
here
he
was
a
man
of
long
experience
and
near
seventeen
years
old
yet
he
had
never
been
in
prison
few
very
few
of
such
an
age
could
say
that
sometimes
he
saw
his
old
enemy
the
hunchback
who
worked
at
a
shoemaker
but
he
saw
him
with
unconcern
he
cared
nothing
for
now
the
memory
of
old
injuries
had
dulled
and
after
all
this
was
a
merely
inconsiderable
hunchback
whom
it
were
beneath
his
dignity
to
regard
with
anything
but
tolerant
indifference
bob
roper
steered
clear
at
such
encounters
and
showed
his
teeth
like
a
cat
and
looked
back
malevolently
it
did
matter
dicky
was
not
married
either
in
the
simple
jago
fashion
or
in
church
there
was
little
difference
as
a
matter
of
fact
so
far
as
facility
went
there
was
a
church
in
bethnal
green
where
you
might
be
married
for
sevenpence
if
you
were
fourteen
years
old
and
no
questions
asked
or
at
any
rate
they
were
questions
answers
whereunto
were
easy
to
invent
you
just
came
in
drunk
if
possible
with
a
batch
of
some
scores
and
rowdied
about
the
church
with
your
hat
on
and
the
curate
worked
off
the
crowd
at
one
go
calling
the
names
one
after
another
you
sang
or
you
shouted
or
you
drank
out
of
a
bottle
or
you
flung
a
at
a
friend
as
the
fancy
took
you
and
the
whole
thing
was
not
a
bad
joke
for
the
money
though
after
all
sevenpence
is
and
not
to
be
wasted
but
dicky
had
had
enough
to
do
to
look
after
his
mother
and
em
and
little
josh
as
hannah
perrott
had
called
the
baby
dicky
indeed
had
a
family
already
more
the
jago
girls
affected
him
with
an
odd
feeling
of
repulsion
not
of
themselves
perhaps
though
they
were
squalid
drabs
long
ere
they
were
ripe
for
the
sevenpenny
church
but
by
comparison
with
the
clean
remote
who
were
visible
through
the
broad
windows
in
the
outer
streets
dicky
intended
the
day
to
be
a
holiday
he
was
not
going
as
the
word
went
for
had
a
way
of
coming
on
notable
days
like
this
and
he
might
easily
chance
to
before
his
father
got
home
he
was
almost
too
big
now
for
carrying
bags
at
liverpool
street
because
small
boys
looked
cheaper
than
large
ones
not
that
there
was
anything
especially
large
about
dicky
beyond
his
height
of
five
feet
two
and
at
the
moment
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
that
might
turn
a
copper
he
stood
irresolute
on
the
high
street
footway
and
as
he
stood
kiddo
cook
hove
in
sight
dragging
a
of
carrots
and
cabbages
kiddo
had
not
yet
compassed
the
stall
with
the
awning
but
it
was
almost
in
sight
for
the
barrow
could
scarce
hold
all
that
he
could
sell

there
was
a
joke
abroad
that
he
was
to
be
married
in
father
sturt
church

facetiously
suggesting
that
mother
gapp
would
prove
a
good
investment
commercially

others
maintained
the
greater

of

and
kiddo
stuffed
his
handkerchief
into
his

pocket
pulled
his
cap
tight
and
bent
to
his
dicky
turned
idly
to
the
left
and
slouched
to
the
corner
of
meakin
street
there
he
loafed
for
a
little
while
and
then
went
as
aimlessly
up
the
turning
meakin
street
was
much
as
ever
there
were
still
the
chandlers
shops
where
tea
and
sugar
were
sold
by
the
farthingsworth
and
the
barber
where
hair
was
fashionably
cut
for
three
though
jago
hair
was
commonly
cut
in
another
place
and
received
little
more
attention
there
was
still
walker
foggy
with
steam
its
windows
all
and
there
was
the
original
tog
emporium
with
its
kicksies
and
its
benjamins
cut
saucy
as
ever
and
its
double
fakements
still
artful
at
the
there
was
another
young
student
but
his
advice
and
medicine
were
sixpence
just
as
his
remote
predecessor
had
been
for
little
looey
long
forgotten
and
farther
down
on
the
opposite
side
mr
aaron
weech
with
its
festival
bills
maintained
its
general
air
and
displayed
its
shrivelled
bloaters
its
doubtful
cake
and
its
pallid
scones
in
an
odour
of
respectability
and
stale
pickles
dicky
glanced
in
as
he
came
by
the
door
and
met
the
anxious
eye
of
mr
weech
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
a
fortnight
for
dicky
was
no
boy
now
but
knew
enough
to
sell
at
cohen
or
elsewhere
whenever
possible
and
to
care
not
a
rap
for
mr
weech
as
that
tradesman
saw
dicky
he
burst
into
an
eager
smile
and
came
forward
mornin
er
with
a
quick
glance
perrott

exceedingly
though
there
was
something
lacking
in
his
delight
there

very
moment
sairer
ai
that
rasher
done
yut
dicky
did
not
understand
this
liberality
but
he
had
long
since
adopted
the
policy
of
taking
all
he
could
get
so
he
sat
at
a
table
and
mr
weech
sat
opposite
like
ole
times
ai
it
said
mr
weech
that
reminds
me
i
owe
you
a
shillin

the
table
and
dicky
pocketed
it
nothing
loth
the
thing
might
be
hard
to
understand
but
that
concerned
him
not
there
was
the
shilling
likewise
there
was
the
bacon
and
the
coffee
that
went
with
it
and
dicky
went
at
them
with
a
will
recking
nothing
of
why
they
were
there
and
nothing
of
any
matter
which
might
make
the
giver
anxious
in
the
prospect
of
an
early
meeting
with
josh
mr
weech
went
on
be
quite
a
pleasure
to
see
yer
father
agin
that
it
will
wot
a
blessed
release
free
from
the
lor
o
condition
as
the
says

if
there

mr
perrott
i

chance

not
as
i

very
pore
an
it
sich
a
but
i
do
it
for
yer
father
yus
if
it

copper

an
if
like
any
little

comes
sich
as
a
or
a
bit
wy
i
wrop
it
up
an
send
it
this
was
all
very
handsome
and
dicky
wished
some
notion
of
the
sort
had
occurred
to
mr
weech
on
a
few
of
the
dinnerless
days
of
the
past
four
years
but
he
went
away
wondering
if
it
might
not
be
well
to
regard
mr
weech
with
caution
for
a
while
for
there
must
be
a
reason
for
all
this
generosity
xxxi
it
was
in
mother
gapp
that
josh
perrott
and
his
family
met
hannah
had
started
out
with
an
idea
of
meeting
him
at
waterloo
station
but
finding
herself
an
object
of
distinction
and
congratulation
among
the
women
she
met
she
had
lingered
by
the
way
accepting
many
little
drops
to
prove
herself
not
unduly
proud
and
so
had
failed
of
her
intent
josh
on
his
part
had
not
been
abstinent
he
had
successfully
run
the
gauntlet
of
prisoners
aid
societies
and
the
like
professing
to
have
job
waiting
for
him
in
shoreditch
and
his
way
across
london
had
been
freely
punctuated
at
for
his
prison
gratuity
was
a
very
pleasant
and
useful
little
sum
and
now
when
at
last
they
met
he
was
not
especially
gracious
he
wanted
to
know
not
only
why
he
had
found
nobody
at
home
but
also
why
hannah
had
never
been
to
see
him
at
portland
as
to
the
second
question
the
obvious
and
sufficient
answer
was
that
the
return
fare
to
portland
would
have
been
some
shillings
a
sum
that
hannah
had
never
seen
together
since
josh
left
her
as
to
the
first
she
protested
with
muddled
vehemence
that
she
had
gone
to
meet
him
and
had
missed
him
by
some
mistake
as
to
arrival
platforms
so
that
at
length
urged
thereto
by
the
rest
of
the
customers
at
the
feathers
josh
kissed
her
sulkily
and
ordered
her
a
drink
em
was
distrustful
at
first
but
drank
her
allowance
of
gin
with
much
relish
tipping
the
glass
again
and
again
to
catch
the
last
drop
and
little
josh
now
for
the
first
time
introduced
to
josh
the
elder
took
a
dislike
to
his
father
not
particularly
sober
glare
and
grin
and
roared
aloud
upon
his
knee
assailing
him
between
the
roars
with
every
curse
familiar
in
the
jago
amid
the
genial
merriment
of
the
company
dicky
came
in
quietly
and
stood
at
his
father
elbow
with
the
pride
natural
to
a
dutiful
son
on
such
an
occasion
and
at
they
all
helped
each
other
home
in
the
morning
josh
rose
late
he
looked
all
the
better
for
his
lagging
browner
than
ever
in
the
face
smarter
and
stouter
in
a
corner
he
perceived
a
little
heap
of
made
and
hard
by
the
material
for
more
it
was
em
work
of
yesterday
morning
said
josh
musingly
a
gross
and
he
kicked
the
heap
to
splinters
he
strolled
out
into
the
street
to
survey
the
jago
in
the
bulk
it
was
little
changed
though
the
county
council
had
made
a
difference
in
the
corner
and
was
creeping
farther
and
farther
still
the
dispossessed
jagos
had
gone
to
infect
the
neighbourhoods
across
the
border
and
to
crowd
the
people
a
little
closer
they
did
not
return
to
live
in
the
new
which
was
a
strange
thing
for
the
county
council
was
charging
very
little
more
than
double
the
rents
which
the
landlords
of
the
old
jago
had
charged
and
so
another
jago
teeming
and
villainous
as
the
one
displaced
was
slowly
growing
in
the
form
of
a
ring
round
about
the
great
yellow
houses
but
the
new
church
and
its
attendant
buildings
most
took
josh
notice
they
were
little
more
than
begun
when
last
he
walked
old
jago
street
in
daylight
and
now
they
stood
large
and
healthy
amid
the
dens
about
them
a
wonder
and
a
pride
as
he
looked
jerry
gullen
and
bill
rann
passed
sang
out
bill
rann
who
remembered
the
old
bailey
fiction
of
four
years
back
and
thought
it
a
capital
joke
sort
o
thing
ai
it
said
jerry
gullen
with
indignant
sarcasm
jerking
his
thumb
toward
the
new
church
street
clean
ruined
wot
the
good
o
livin
now
wy
a
man
must
even
do
a
click
blimy
doncher
asked
josh
with
a
grin
hereat
another
grin
broke
wide
on
jerry
gullen
face
and
he
went
his
way
with
a
wink
and
a
whistle
so
you
back
again
josh
perrott
said
old
beveridge
seedier
than
ever
with
the
up
fresh
chalked
on
the
changeless
hat
again
pity
you
could
stay
there
is
it
pity
we
ca
all
stay
there
josh
looked
after
the
gaunt
old
figure
with
much
doubt
and
a
vague
indignation
for
such
a
view
was
foreign
to
his
understanding
and
as
he
looked
father
sturt
came
out
of
the
church
and
laid
his
hand
on
shoulder
exclaimed
the
vicar
again
without
coming
to
see
me
but
there
you
must
have
been
coming
i
hope
you
have
been
knocking
long
come
in
now
at
any
rate
you
looking
wonderfully
well
what
a
capital
thing
a
holiday
is
is
it
a
good
long
one
taking
josh
by
the
arm
he
hauled
him
grinning
sheepish
and
almost
blushing
toward
the
club
door
and
at
that
moment
sam
cash
came
hurrying
round
luck
row
corner
with
his
finger
through
a
string
and
on
that
string
a
bunch
of
grouse
me
said
father
sturt
turning
back
but
without
releasing
arm
our
dear
friend
sam
cash
taking
home
something
for
his
lunch
come
sam
with
such
a
fine
lot
of
birds
as
that
i
sure
be
proud
to
tell
us
where
they
came
from
eh
for
a
moment
sam
cash
was
a
trifle
puzzled
even
offended
then
there
fell
over
his
face
the
mask
of
utter
inexpression
which
the
vicar
had
learned
to
know
said
sam
cash
stolidly
bin
a
little
shootin
with
a
friend
dear
what
a
charming
friend
and
where
are
his
moors
nowhere
about
the
bethnal
green
road
i
suppose
by
the
goods
depot
come
now
i
sure
josh
perrott
would
like
to
know
you
did
get
any
shooting
in
your
little
holiday
did
you
josh
josh
grinned
delighted
but
sam
shuffled
uneasily
with
a
hopeless
sidelong
glance
as
in
search
of
a
hole
wherein
to
hide
you
see
father
sturt
said
does
want
his
friend
hospitality
to
be
abused
let
me
see
two
four
six
why
there
must
be
nine
or
ten
brace
and
all
at
one
shot
too
sam
always
makes
his
bag
at
one
shot
you
know
josh
whatever
the
game
is
yes
wonderful
shooting
and
did
you
shoot
the
label
at
the
same
time
sam
come
i
like
to
look
at
that
label
but
the
wretched
sam
was
off
at
a
bolt
faster
than
a
police
pursuit
would
have
sent
him
while
josh
guffawed
joyously
to
be
by
father
sturt
was
the
true
jago
terror
but
to
the
jagos
looking
on
it
was
pure
delight
theft
was
a
piece
of
the
jago
nature
but
at
least
father
sturt
could
wither
the
pride
of
it
by
such
ridicule
as
the
jago
could
understand
he
very
bashful
for
a
sportsman
is
he
josh
the
vicar
proceeded
you
must
come
and
see
the
club
at
once
you
shall
be
a
member
josh
spent
near
an
hour
in
the
new
buildings
father
sturt
showed
him
the
club
the
night
shelter
the
church
and
his
own
little
rooms
he
asked
too
much
about
josh
intentions
for
the
future
of
course
josh
was
to
look
for
a
job
father
sturt
knew
he
would
say
that
every
jago
had
been
going
to
look
for
a
job
ever
since
the
vicar
first
came
to
the
place
but
he
professed
to
take
josh
word
seriously
and
offered
to
try
to
get
him
taken
on
as
a
plasterer
at
some
of
the
new
county
council
buildings
he
flattered
josh
by
reminding
him
of
his
command
of
a
regular
trade
josh
was
a
man
with
opportunities
and
he
should
be
above
the
pitiable
expedients
of
the
poor
untradesmanlike
about
him
indeed
he
should
leave
the
jago
altogether
with
his
family
and
start
afresh
in
a
new
place
a
reputable
mechanic
to
these
things
josh
perrott
listened
with
fidgety
deference
answering
only
father
when
it
seemed
to
be
necessary
in
the
end
he
promised
to
it
over
which
meant
nothing
as
the
parson
well
knew
and
in
the
mood
in
which
josh
came
away
he
would
gladly
have
risked
another
lagging
to
serve
father
sturt
convenience
but
he
would
rather
have
suffered
one
than
take
father
sturt
advice
he
made
the
day
a
holiday
he
had
been
told
that
he
was
in
for
a
little
excitement
for
it
was
held
that
fitting
time
had
arrived
for
another
scrap
with
dove
lane
but
the
affair
was
not
yet
moving
snob
spicer
had
broken
a
window
with
a
head
it
was
true
but
nothing
had
come
of
it
and
etiquette
demanded
that
the
next
card
should
be
played
by
dove
lane
for
the
present
the
jago
was
content
to
take
thought
for
josh
lead
such
a
thing
was
everybody
right
on
return
from
a
lagging
and
this
one
was
fixed
for
a
night
next
week
all
that
day
mr
weech
looked
out
anxiously
but
josh
perrott
never
passed
his
way
xxxii
bill
rann
called
for
josh
early
the
next
morning
and
they
strolled
down
old
jago
street
in
close
communion
you
on
for
a
job
asked
bill
i
got
one
cut
an
dried
a
topper
an
safe
as
sort
o
job
this
a
bust
unless
we
can
screw
it
this
meant
a
with
a
possibility
of
a
quieter
entrance
by
means
of
keys
it
was
unpleasantly
suggestive
of
josh
last
exploit
but
he
answered
depends
o
course
it
a
good
un
bill
rann
grinned
for
no
obvious
reason
and
slapped
his
leg
to
express
rapturous
amusement
a
good
un
you
can
take
yer
davy
o
that
i
bin
a
thinkin
about
it
for
a
fortnight
but
it
wants
two
damme
it
nobby
and
bill
rann
grinned
again
and
made
two
taps
of
a
think
he
pursued
suddenly
serious
think
o
screwin
a
fence
it
was
a
novel
notion
but
in
josh
mind
at
first
flush
it
seemed
unsportmanlike
fence
asked
josh
bill
rann
grin
burst
wide
again
he
bent
low
with
outstretched
chin
and
stuck
his
elbows
out
as
he
answered
ole
weech
josh
bared
his
teeth
but
with
no
smile
looking
sharply
in
the
upturned
face
bill
rann
bent
nearly
double
and
with
hands
in
pockets
flapped
his
arms
in
the
manner
of
wings
chuckled
aloud
and
jerking
his
feet
back
and
forth
went
elaborately
through
the
first
movement
of
the
eh
said
he
that
strike
ye
ole
cock
josh
answered
not
but
his
parted
lips
stretched
wide
and
his
passed
quickly
over
them
while
he
thought
be
a
fair
cop
for
bill
pursued
eagerly
treated
us
all
pretty
mean
one
time
or
other
wy
i
bet

quid

us
wot

all
the
times
squeeged

a
bit

to

own

josh
growled
glaring
fiercely
was
as
put
me
away
for
my
laggin
swine
bill
rann
stopped
surprised
he
exclaimed
weech
narked

know
that
josh
told
the
tale
of
his
negotiations
in
the
matter
of
the
watch
and
described
weech
terror
at
sight
of
his
dash
at
the
on
said
josh
in
conclusion
one
way
o
an
it
bring
a
bit
in
better
not
show
i
abaat
would
git
auf
with
a
punch
on
the
chin
like
the
bloke
at
josh
perrott
ended
with
a
tigerish
snarl
and
a
white
spot
at
the
curl
of
each
of
his
nostrils
said
bill
rann
so
it
was
was
it
i
often
wondered
you
meant
well
flimpin
the
best
way
wo
sing
a
finds
stuff
weeded
bill
flung
back
his
head
and
laughed
again
there
let
lay
it
out
and
the
two
men
fell
to
the
discussion
of
methods
weech
was
to
be
his
undoing
it
was
the
obvious
plan
the
front
shutters
were
impracticable
in
such
a
place
as
meakin
street
but
the
alleys
in
the
rear
were
a
perfect
approach
bill
rann
had
surveyed
the
spot
attentively
and
after
expert
consideration
he
had
selected
the
window
as
the
point
of
entrance
old
boxes
and
littered
the
yard
and
it
would
be
easy
to
mount
a
selected
box
shift
the
catch
of
the
little
window
and
wriggle
in
feet
first
without
noise
true
the
door
between
the
and
the
other
rooms
might
be
fastened
but
it
could
be
worked
at
under
cover
and
bill
rann
had
a
belief
that
there
must
be
a
good
deal
of
in
the
itself
there
would
be
nobody
in
the
house
but
weech
because
the
wretched
old
woman
who
swept
the
floors
and
cooked
bloaters
was
sent
away
at
night
so
that
every
room
must
be
unoccupied
but
one
as
for
tools
josh
had
none
but
bill
rann
undertook
to
provide
them
and
in
the
matter
of
time
it
was
considered
that
that
same
night
would
be
as
good
as
any
it
would
be
better
than
most
in
fact
for
it
was
wednesday
and
bill
rann
had
observed
that
mr
weech
went
to
the
bank
in
high
street
shoreditch
pretty
regularly
on
thursday
mornings
this
day
also
mr
weech
kept
a
careful
watch
for
josh
perrott
but
saw
him
not
xxxiii
hannah
perrott
did
her
best
to
keep
josh
from
going
out
that
night
she
did
not
explain
her
objections
because
she
did
not
know
precisely
what
they
were
though
they
were
in
some
sort
prompted
by
his
manner
and
it
was
solely
because
of
her
constitutional
inability
to
urge
them
with
any
persistence
that
she
escaped
forcible
retort
for
josh
was
in
a
savage
and
mood
wot
up
asked
bill
rann
when
they
met
looking
doubtfully
in
his
pal
face
ai
bin
boozin
ye
josh
repelled
the
question
with
a
snarl
i
ai
he
said
the
tools
there
was
a
thickness
in
his
voice
with
a
wildness
in
his
eye
that
might
well
explain
his
partner
doubt
come
under
the
light
i
could
git
no
twirls
an
we
want
a
screwdriver
an
two
gimlets
an
a
knife
for
the
winderketch
an
a
little
james
an
a
neddy
neddy
josh
cut
in
scornfully
pointing
his
thumb
at
the
instrument
which
some
call
neddy
for
weech
i
might
take
a
neddy
to
a
awright
bill
replied
it

glad

without

be
afraid
to
sing
out
for
fear
o
bringin
in
the
coppers
to
find
all
the
stuff
bought
on
the
crook
it
all
done
once
we
inside
it
was
near
midnight
and
bill
rann
had
observed
weech
putting
up
his
shutters
at
eleven
so
the
two
jagos
walked
slowly
along
meakin
street
on
the
side
opposite
weech
with
sharp
eyes
for
the
windows
all
was
quiet
there
was
no
visible
light
none
from
the
skylight
over
the
shop
door
none
from
the
window
above
none
from
the
garret
window
above
that
they
passed
on
crossed
the
road
strolled
back
and
listened
at
the
door
there
was
no
sound
from
within
the
clock
in
a
distant
steeple
struck
twelve
and
was
joined
at
the
fourth
stroke
by
the
loud
bell
of
st
leonards
hard
by
and
ere
the
last
mild
note
had
sounded
from
the
farthest
clock
in
the
awakened
chorus
josh
perrott
and
bill
rann
had
taken
the
next
turning
and
were
pushing
their
way
to
the
alleys
behind
weech
foul
these
alleys
not
to
be
traversed
by
a
stranger
josh
and
bill
plunged
into
one
narrow
archway
after
another
each
of
which
might
have
been
the
private
passage
of
a
house
and
came
at
last
stealthy
and
unseen
into
the
muddy
yard
weech
was
before
them
and
black
crowded
them
round
there
were
but
one
or
two
lights
in
the
windows
and
those
windows
were
shut
and
curtained
the
rear
of
weech
house
was
black
and
silent
as
the
front
they
peered
over
the
fence
the
yard
was
but
faint
angular
tokens
here
and
there
told
of
heaped
boxes
and
lumber
wo
tip
the
whistle
this
time
whispered
bill
rann
with
a
smothered
chuckle
he
bent
his
knee
and
josh
straddled
from
it
over
the
rickety
fence
with
quiet
care
and
lowered
himself
gingerly
on
the
other
side
he
whispered
on
since
bill
display
of
the
tools
josh
had
scarce
spoken
a
word
bill
wondered
at
his
taciturnity
but
respected
it
as
a
quality
in
the
circumstances
it
was
but
a
matter
of
four
or
five
yards
to
the
window
but
they
bent
and
felt
their
way
josh
took
up
an
old
as
he
went
and
planted
it
on
the
ground
below
the
window
stretching
his
hand
for
the
knife
as
he
did
so
and
now
he
took
command
and
foremost
place
it
was
an
old
shoemaker
knife
with
too
long
a
handle
for
there
was
a
in
the
sash
and
the
knife
would
not
bend
presently
bill
rann
below
could
see
that
josh
was
cutting
away
the
putty
from
the
pane
and
in
five
minutes
the
pane
itself
was
put
into
his
hand
he
stooped
and
laid
it
noiselessly
on
the
soft
ground
josh
turned
the
catch
and
lifted
the
sash
there
was
some
noise
but
not
much
as
he
pushed
the
frame
up
evenly
with
a
thumb
at
each
side
they
waited
but
it
was
quite
still
and
josh
sitting
on
the
sill
manoeuvred
his
legs
one
at
a
time
through
the
narrow
opening
then
turning
over
he
let
himself
down
and
beckoned
bill
rann
to
follow
bill
rann
had
a
small
tin
box
with
an
inch
of
candle
on
the
inside
of
one
end
so
that
when
the
wick
was
lit
the
contrivance
made
a
simple
but
an
effective
lantern
the
light
whereof
shone
in
front
alone
and
could
be
extinguished
at
a
puff
now
a
match
was
struck
and
a
quick
view
taken
of
the
there
was
not
much
about
only
cracked
and
greasy
plates
jars
tins
pots
and
pans
and
in
a
corner
a
miscellaneous
heap
plainly
cheap
pilferings
covered
with
a
bit
of
old
carpet
the
air
was
offensive
with
the
characteristic
smell
of
weech
the
smell
of
stale
pickles
ai
nothin
to
waste
time
over
said
josh
aloud
on
up
you
damn
fool
exclaimed
bill
rann
in
a
whisper
want
to
wake
why
not
was
the
reply
still
aloud
bill
began
to
feel
that
his
pal
was
really
drunk
but
silent
once
more
josh
applied
himself
to
the
door
of
the
inner
room
it
was
crank
and
old
worn
and
battered
at
the
edges
josh
forced
the
wedge
end
of
the
jemmy
through
the
jamb
splintering
the
perished
wood
of
the
frame
and
with
a
push
forced
the
of
the
lock
off
its
screws
there
was
still
a
bolt
at
the
top
that
at
the
bottom
had
lost
its
catch
but
this
gave
as
little
trouble
as
the
lock
bill
rann
strained
the
door
open
from
below
the
jemmy
entered
readily
and
in
a
few
seconds
the
top
bolt
was
in
like
case
with
the
bottom
they
entered
the
room
behind
the
shop
and
it
was
innocent
and
disappointing
a
loo
table
four
chairs
a
mirror
three
coloured
two
china
figures
and
a
cheap
walnut
sideboard
that
was
all
the
slow
step
of
a
policeman
without
stopped
with
a
push
at
the
to
test
its
fastenings
and
then
went
on
and
stronger
than
ever
was
the
smell
of
stale
pickles
to
try
the
shop
would
be
mere
waste
of
time
weech
pocket
was
the
till
and
there
could
be
no
other
prize
a
door
at
the
side
of
the
room
latched
simply
gave
on
the
stairs
auf
yer
boots
bill
whispered
unlacing
his
own
and
slinging
them
across
his
shoulder
by
the
tied
laces
but
josh
would
not
and
he
said
so
with
an
oath
bill
could
not
understand
him
it
be
drink
bill
wished
him
a
mile
away
he
whispered
set
down
i
slip
upstairs
take
a
peep
i
bet
the
stuffs
in
the
garret
best
one
goes
quiet
josh
sat
and
bill
taking
his
lantern
crept
up
the
stairs
noiselessly
save
for
one
creak
he
gained
the
listened
a
moment
along
the
small
landing
and
was
up
the
steep
and
narrow
when
he
heard
a
sound
and
stopped
somebody
was
on
the
lower
flight
there
was
a
heavy
tread
with
the
kick
of
a
boot
against
stair
or
and
then
came
noisy
steps
along
the
landing
josh
was
coming
up
in
his
boots
bill
rann
was
at
his
wits
end
he
backed
down
the
and
met
josh
at
the
foot
ye
balmy
he
hissed
fiercely
catching
josh
by
the
collar
and
pulling
him
into
the
turn
of
the
stairs
d
want
another
five
stretch
a
loud
creak
and
a
soft
thump
sounded
from
behind
the
door
at
the
other
end
of
the
landing
and
then
a
match
was
struck
back
on
the
stairs
bill
whispered
you
josh
sat
on
a
stair
perfectly
still
with
his
legs
drawn
up
out
of
sight
from
the
door
bill
blew
out
his
light
he
would
not
venture
open
intimidation
of
weech
now
with
josh
half
muzzy
lest
some
burst
of
lunacy
brought
in
the
police
a
soft
treading
of
bare
feet
the
squeak
of
a
a
light
on
the
landing
and
aaron
weech
stood
at
his
open
door
in
his
shirt
candle
in
hand
his
hair
rumpled
his
head
aside
his
mouth
a
little
open
his
unconscious
gaze
upward
listening
intently
he
took
a
slight
step
forward
and
then
bill
rann
heart
turned
over
and
over
for
josh
perrott
sprang
from
the
stair
and
his
shoulders
humped
and
his
face
thrust
out
walked
deliberately
across
the
landing
weech
turned
his
head
quickly
his
chin
fell
on
his
chest
as
by
there
were
but
dots
amid
the
white
of
his
eyes
his
head
lay
slowly
back
as
the
candle
tilted
and
shot
its
grease
on
the
floor
the
door
swung
wider
as
his
shoulder
struck
it
and
he
screamed
like
a
rabbit
that
sees
a
stoat
then
with
a
wrench
he
turned
letting
drop
the
candle
and
ran
shrieking
to
the
window
flung
it
open
and
yelled
into
the
black
street
murder

josh
run

blasted
fool
roared
bill
rann
bounding
across
the
landing
and
snatching
at
his
arm
on
go
on
i
comin
josh
answered
without
turning
his
head
and
bill
took
the
bottom
flight
at
a
jump
the
candle
flared
as
it
lay
on
the
floor
and
spread
a
greasy
pool
about
it
murder
josh
had
the
man
by
the
shoulder
swung
him
back
from
the
window
gripped
his
throat
and
dragged
him
across
the
carpet
as
he
might
drag
a
cat
while
weech
arms
waved
uselessly
and
his
feet
feebly
sought
a
hold
on
the
floor
cried
josh
perrott
glaring
on
the
writhen
face
below
his
own
and
raising
his
in
the
manner
of
a
cleaver

and
of

shouting

and
there
were
shrill
whistles

twice
the
knife
hacked
the
livid
face
but
the
third
hack
was
below
the
chin
and
the
face
fell
back
the
bubbling
thing
dropped
in
a
heap
and
put
out
the
flaring
candle
without
the
shouts
gathered
to
a
roar
and
the
door
shook
under
heavy
blows
open
the
door
cried
a
deep
voice
he
looked
from
the
open
window
there
was
a
scrambling
crowd
and
more
people
were
running
in
windows
gaped
and
thrust
out
noisy
heads
the
flash
of
a
dazzled
him
and
he
staggered
back
perrott
came
a
shout
he
had
but
glanced
out
but
he
was
recognised
he
threw
down
his
knife
and
made
for
the
landing
slipping
on
the
wet
floor
and
stumbling
against
the
heap
there
were
shouts
from
behind
the
house
now
they
were
few
but
they
were
close
he
dashed
up
the
narrow
stairs
floundered
through
the
back
garret
over
bags
and
boxes
and
heaps
of
mingled
commodities
and
threw
up
the
sash
men
were
stumbling
invisibly
in
the
dark
yard
below
he
got
upon
the
sill
swung
round
by
the
and
went
hands
and
knees
along
the
roof
yells
and
loud
whistles
rose
clamant
in
the
air
and
his
own
name
was
shouted
to
and
fro
then
the
blows
on
the
ceased
with
a
splintering
crash
and
there
was
a
trampling
of
feet
on
the
roofs
were
irregular
in
shape
and
height
and
his
progress
was
slow
he
aimed
at
reaching
the
roof
of
father
sturt
old
club
building
still
empty
he
had
had
this
in
mind
from
the
moment
he
climbed
from
the
for
in
the
work
of
setting
the
drains
in
order
an
iron
ventilating
pipe
had
been
carried
up
from
the
to
well
above
the
roof
it
was
a
stout
pipe
close
by
the
wall
to
which
it
was
clamped
with
iron
attachments
four
years
had
passed
since
he
had
seen
it
and
he
trusted
to
luck
to
find
it
still
standing
for
it
seemed
his
only
chance
down
below
people
scampered
and
shouted
crowds
had
sprung
out
of
the
dark
night
as
by
magic
and
the
police
they
must
have
been
lying
in
wait
in
scores
it
seemed
a
mere
matter
of
seconds
since
he
had
scaled
the
back
fence
and
now
people
were
tearing
about
the
house
behind
him
and
shouting
out
of
windows
to
those
below
he
hoped
that
the
iron
pipe
might
not
be
gone
good
it
was
there
he
peered
from
the
parapet
down
into
the
and
the
place
seemed
empty
he
gripped
the
pipe
with
hands
and
knees
and
descended
the
alley
had
no
back
way
he
must
take
his
chance
in
meakin
street
he
peeped
at
the
street
end
there
was
a
dark
obstruction
set
with
spots
of
light
a
row
of
police
that
way
was
shut
he
must
try
the
jago
luck
row
was
almost
opposite
and
no
jago
would
betray
him
the
hunters
were
already
on
the
roofs
men
shouted
up
to
them
from
the
street
and
kept
pace
with
them
coming
nearer
he
took
a
breath
and
dashed
across
knocking
a
man
over
at
the
corner
up
luck
row
into
old
jago
street
he
ran
past
his
own
home
and
across
to
a
black
doorway
just
as
father
sturt
roused
by
the
persistent
din
opened
his
window
the
passage
was
empty
and
for
an
instant
he
paused
breathless
but
there
were
howls
without
and
the
pelting
of
many
feet
the
man
knocked
over
at
the
corner
had
given
the
alarm
and
the
hunt
was
up
into
the
and
over
the
fence
through
another
passage
into
new
jago
street
with
a
notion
to
gain
the
courts
by
honey
lane
and
so
away
but
he
was
thinking
of
the
jago
as
it
had
been
he
had
forgotten
the
demolishment
as
he
neared
jago
row
the
place
of
it
lay
suddenly
before
him
an
open
waste
of
eighty
yards
square
skirted
by
the
straight
streets
and
the
yellow
barracks
with
the
board
school
standing
dark
among
them
and
along
the
straight
streets
more
men
were
rushing
and
more
police
they
were
why
not
venture
over
he
rubbed
his
cheek
for
something
like
a
film
of
gum
clung
to
it
then
he
remembered
and
peered
closely
at
his
hands
blood
sticking
and
drying
and
peeling
blood
on
hands
and
face
blood
on
clothes
without
a
doubt
to
go
abroad
thus
were
to
court
arrest
were
he
known
or
not
it
must
be
got
off
but
how
to
go
home
was
to
give
himself
up
the
police
were
there
long
since
they
swarmed
the
jago
through
some
houses
stood
at
hand
and
he
made
for
the
nearest
there
were
cellars
under
these
houses
reached
from
the
many
a
jago
had
been
born
had
lived
and
had
died
in
such
a
place
a
cellar
would
hide
him
for
an
hour
while
he
groped
himself
clean
as
he
might
broken
brickwork
littered
the
space
that
had
been
the
feeling
in
the
dark
for
the
steps
which
stood
in
a
little
pit
his
foot
turned
on
a
stone
and
he
pitched
headlong
the
cellar
itself
was
littered
with
rubbish
and
he
lay
among
it
a
little
while
breathless
and
bruised
when
he
tried
to
rise
he
found
his
ankle
useless
it
was
the
old
sprain
got
at
mother
gapp
before
his
lagging
and
ever
ready
to
assert
itself
he
sat
among
the
brickbats
to
pull
off
the
boot
that
was
foul
and
sticky
too
and
he
rubbed
the
ankle
he
had
been
a
fool
to
think
of
the
cellar
why
not
any
corner
among
the
walls
above
he
had
given
way
to
the
mere
panic
instinct
to
burrow
to
hide
himself
in
a
hole
and
he
had
chosen
one
wherefrom
there
was
no
second
way
of
escape
none
at
all
but
by
the
steps
he
had
fallen
in
at
far
better
to
have
struck
out
boldly
across
the
streets
by
columbia
market
to
the
canal
who
could
have
seen
the
smears
in
the
darkness
and
in
the
canal
he
might
have
washed
the
lot
away
secure
from
observation
under
a
bridge
the
thing
might
be
possible
even
now
if
he
could
stand
the
pain
but
no
the
foot
was
useless
when
he
tried
it
he
was
trapped
like
a
rat
he
rubbed
and
kneaded
the
ankle
diligently
and
managed
to
draw
the
boot
on
but
stand
on
both
legs
he
could
not
he
might
have
crawled
up
the
steps
on
hands
and
knees
but
what
was
the
use
of
that
so
he
sat
and
waited
knots
of
men
went
hurrying
by
and
he
caught
snatches
of
their
talk
there
had
been
a
murder
a
man
was
murdered
in
his
bed
it
was
a
woman
a
man
had
murdered
his
wife
there
were
two
murders
three
the
tale
went
every
way
but
it
was
always
murder
murder
murder
everybody
was
saying
murder
till
in
the
passing
footsteps
in
the
vague
shouts
in
the
distance
and
presently
in
the
mere
black
about
him
he
heard
the
word
still
murder
murder
murder
he
fell
to
contrasting
the
whispered
fancy
with
the
real
screams
in
that
bedroom
he
wondered
what
bill
rann
thought
of
it
all
and
what
had
become
of
the
james
and
the
gimlets
he
pictured
the
crowd
in
old
jago
street
pushing
into
his
room
talking
about
him
telling
the
news
he
wondered
if
hannah
had
been
asleep
when
they
came
and
what
she
said
when
they
told
her
and
more
people
hurried
past
the
ruined
house
all
talking
murder
murder
still
murder
the
foot
was
horribly
painful
was
it
swelling
yes
he
thought
it
was
he
rubbed
it
again
what
would
dicky
do
if
only
dicky
knew
where
he
was
that
might
help
there
was
a
new
burst
of
shouts
in
the
distance
what
was
that
perhaps
they
had
caught
bill
rann
but
that
was
unlikely
they
knew
nothing
of
bill
they
had
seen
but
one
man
perhaps
they
were
carrying
away
the
heap
on
a
shutter
that
would
be
no
nice
job
especially
down
the
steep
stairs
there
had
been
very
little
in
the
and
nothing
in
the
next
room
the
garrets
were
pretty
full
of
odd
things
but
no
doubt
the
money
was
in
the
bedroom
the
smell
of
stale
pickles
was
very
strong
so
his
thoughts
chased
one
another
eager
trivial
crowded
till
his
head
ached
with
their
splitting
haste
to
take
heed
for
the
future
to
plan
escape
to
design
expedients
these
were
merely
impossible
sitting
there
inactive
in
the
dark
he
thought
of
the
pipe
he
had
slid
down
what
it
cost
why
they
put
it
there
who
the
man
was
that
he
ran
against
at
luck
row
whether
or
not
he
hurt
him
what
the
police
would
do
with
the
bloaters
and
cake
and
bacon
at
the
shop
and
again
of
the
smell
of
stale
pickles
father
sturt
was
up
and
dressed
standing
guard
on
the
landing
outside
the
perrotts
door
the
stairs
were
full
of
jagos
mostly
women
constantly
joined
by
all
anxious
to
batter
the
door
and
belabour
the
hidden
family
with
noisy
sympathy
and
sedulous
inquiries
all
that
is
except
the
oldest
mrs
walsh
in
the
jago
who
possessed
by
an
unshakable
conviction
that
josh
wife
must
have
to
it
had
come
in
a
shawl
and
a
petticoat
to
give
hannah
a
piece
of
her
mind
but
all
were
driven
back
and
sent
grumbling
away
by
father
sturt
every
passage
from
the
jago
was
held
by
the
police
and
a
search
from
house
to
house
was
begun
with
clear
consciences
the
jagos
all
could
deny
any
knowledge
of
josh
perrott
whereabouts
but
a
clear
conscience
was
little
valued
in
those
parts
and
one
after
another
affirmed
point
blank
that
the
man
seen
at
the
window
was
not
perrott
at
all
but
a
stranger
who
lived
a
long
way
off
this
of
course
less
by
way
of
favouring
the
fugitive
than
of
baffling
the
police
the
jago
first
duty
but
the
police
knew
the
worth
of
such
talk
and
the
search
went
on
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
grey
of
the
morning
a
party
in
new
jago
street
after
telling
each
other
that
the
ruins
must
be
carefully
examined
climbed
among
the
rubbish
and
were
startled
by
a
voice
from
underground
cried
josh
perrott
in
the
cellar
done
it
a
cop
come
an
me
out
o
this
xxxiv
the
lion
and
unicorn
had
been
fresh
gilt
since
he
was
there
before
but
the
old
gaoler
in
the
dock
was
much
the
same
and
the
big
sword
what
did
they
have
a
big
sword
for
stuck
up
there
over
the
red
cushions
and
what
was
the
use
of
a
sword
six
foot
long
but
perhaps
it
was
six
foot
after
all
it
looked
longer
than
it
was
and
no
doubt
it
was
only
for
show
and
probably
a
dummy
with
no
blade
there
was
a
black
man
sitting
down
below
among
the
lawyers
what
did
he
want
why
did
they
let
him
in
a
nice
thing
to
be
made
a
show
of
for
niggers
and
josh
perrott
loosened
his
neckcloth
with
an
indignant
tug
of
the
forefinger
and
went
off
into
another
train
of
thought
he
had
a
throbbing
wavering
headache
the
outcome
of
thinking
so
hard
about
so
many
things
they
were
small
things
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
own
business
but
there
were
so
many
of
them
and
they
all
had
to
be
got
through
at
such
a
pace
and
one
thing
led
to
another
ever
since
they
had
taken
him
he
had
been
oppressed
by
this
plague
of
galloping
thought
with
few
intervals
of
rest
when
he
could
consider
immediate
concerns
but
of
these
he
made
little
trouble
the
thing
was
done
very
well
then
he
would
take
his
gruel
like
a
man
he
had
done
many
a
worse
thing
he
said
that
had
been
thought
less
of
the
evidence
was
a
nuisance
what
was
the
good
of
it
all
over
and
over
and
over
again
at
the
inquest
at
the
police
court
and
now
here
repeated
laboriously
taken
down
and
repeated
again
and
now
it
was
worse
than
ever
for
the
judge
insisted
on
making
a
note
of
everything
and
wrote
it
down
slowly
a
word
at
a
time
the
witnesses
were
like
producing
the
same
old
tune
mechanically
without
changing
a
note
there
was
the
policeman
who
was
in
meakin
street
at
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
of
the
month
when
he
heard
cries
of
murder
and
proceeded
to
the
there
was
the
other
policeman
who
also
there
and
recognised
the
prisoner
whom
he
knew
at
the
window
and
there
was
the
sergeant
who
had
found
him
in
the
cellar
and
the
doctor
who
had
made
an
examination
and
the
knife
and
the
boots
and
all
of
it
it
was
murder
murder
murder
still
why
was
it
plain
enough
he
felt
some
interest
in
what
was
coming
in
the
sentence
and
the
black
cap
and
so
on
never
having
seen
a
murder
trial
before
but
all
this
repetition
oppressed
him
vaguely
amid
the
innumerable
things
he
had
to
think
of
one
thing
leading
to
another
hannah
and
dicky
were
there
sitting
together
behind
the
glass
partition
that
rose
at
the
side
of
the
dock
hannah
face
was
down
in
her
hands
and
dicky
face
was
thin
and
white
and
he
sat
with
his
neck
stretched
his
lips
apart
his
head
aside
to
catch
the
smallest
word
his
eyes
too
were
red
with
strained
unwinking
attention
josh
felt
vaguely
that
they
might
keep
a
bolder
face
as
he
did
himself
his
sprained
foot
was
still
far
from
well
but
he
stood
up
putting
his
weight
on
the
other
he
might
have
been
allowed
to
sit
if
he
had
asked
but
that
would
look
like
weakness
there
was
another
judge
this
time
an
older
one
with
spectacles
he
had
come
solemnly
in
after
lunch
with
a
bunch
of
flowers
in
his
hand
and
josh
thought
he
made
an
odd
figure
in
his
long
red
gown
why
did
he
sit
at
the
end
of
the
bench
instead
of
in
the
middle
under
the
long
sword
perhaps
the
old
gentleman
who
sat
there
for
a
little
while
and
then
went
away
was
the
lord
mayor
that
would
account
for
it
there
was
another
room
behind
the
bedroom
at
weech
which
he
had
never
thought
about
perhaps
the
money
was
there
after
all
could
they
have
missed
any
hiding
place
in
the
shop
parlour
no
there
was
the
round
table
with
the
four
chairs
about
it
and
the
little
sideboard
besides
the
texts
on
the
wall
and
two
china
figures
on
the
that
was
all
there
was
a
copper
in
the
but
there
was
nothing
in
it
the
garret
was
a
very
good
place
to
keep
things
in
but
there
was
a
strong
smell
of
stale
pickles
he
could
smell
it
now
he
had
smelt
it
ever
since
the
judge
stopped
a
witness
to
speak
of
a
draught
from
a
window
josh
perrott
watched
the
shutting
of
the
window
they
did
it
with
a
cord
he
had
not
noticed
a
draught
himself
but
pigeons
were
flying
outside
the
panes
and
resting
on
the
pud
palmer
tried
to
keep
pigeons
in
jago
row
but
one
morning
the
trap
was
found
empty
a
poulterer
gave
fourpence
each
for
them
they
were
ticketed
at
eighteenpence
a
pair
in
the
shop
and
that
was
fivepence
profit
apiece
for
the
poulterer
tenpence
a
pair
profit
on
eleven
pairs
was
nearly
ten
shillings
ten
shillings
all
but
tenpence
they
would
have
given
any
more
in
club
row
a
man
had
a
linnet
in
club
row
but
there
was
a
show
in
bethnal
green
road
with
a
sheep
it
was
outside
there
that
ginger
stagg
was
pinched
for
and
so
on
and
so
on
till
his
head
buzzed
again
his
counsel
was
saying
something
how
long
had
he
been
talking
what
was
the
good
of
it
he
had
told
him
that
he
had
no
defence
the
lawyer
was
enlarging
on
the
dead
man
iniquities
talking
of
provocation
and
the
heat
of
passion
and
the
like
he
was
aiming
desperately
at
a
recommendation
to
mercy
that
was
mere
foolery
but
presently
the
judge
began
to
sum
up
they
were
coming
to
something
at
last
but
it
was
merely
the
evidence
once
more
the
judge
blinked
at
his
notes
and
went
at
it
again
the
policeman
with
his
whistle
and
the
other
with
his
lantern
and
the
doctor
and
the
sergeant
and
the
rest
it
was
shorter
this
time
though
josh
perrott
turned
and
looked
at
the
clock
behind
him
with
the
faces
over
it
peering
from
the
gallery
but
when
he
turned
to
face
the
judge
again
he
had
forgotten
the
time
and
crowded
trivialities
were
racing
through
the
narrow
gates
of
his
brain
once
more
there
was
a
cry
for
silence
and
then
a
fresh
voice
spoke
of
the
jury
have
you
agreed
upon
your
verdict
have
the
foreman
was
an
agitated
colourless
man
and
he
spoke
in
a
low
tone
you
find
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
guilty
or
not
guilty
yes
that
was
right
this
was
the
real
business
his
head
was
clear
and
ready
now
is
that
the
verdict
of
you
all
was
that
hannah
sobbing
a
pale
parson
in
his
black
gown
came
walking
along
by
the
bench
and
stood
like
a
tall
ghost
at
the
judge
side
his
eyes
raised
and
his
hands
clasped
the
judge
took
a
black
thing
from
the
seat
beside
him
and
arranged
it
on
his
head
it
was
a
sort
of
soft
mortarboard
josh
noted
curiously
with
a
large
silk
tassel
hanging
over
one
side
giving
the
judge
with
his
wig
and
his
spectacles
and
his
red
gown
a
horribly
jaunty
look
no
brain
could
be
clearer
than
josh
perrott
now
at
the
bar
have
you
anything
to
say
why
sentence
of
death
should
not
be
passed
on
you
according
to
law
sir
i
done
it
was
a
worse
man
than
me
the
clerk
of
arraigns
sank
into
his
place
and
the
judge
spoke
perrott
you
have
been
convicted
on
evidence
that
can
leave
no
doubt
whatever
of
your
guilt
in
the
mind
of
any
rational
person
of
the
horrible
crime
of
wilful
murder
the
circumstances
of
your
awful
offence
there
is
no
need
to
recapitulate
but
they
were
of
the
most
brutal
and
shocking
character
you
deliberately
and
with
preparation
broke
into
the
house
of
the
man
whose
death
you
have
shortly
to
answer
for
in
a
higher
court
than
this
whether
you
broke
in
with
a
design
of
robbery
as
well
as
of
revenge
by
murder
i
know
not
nor
is
it
my
duty
to
consider
but
you
there
with
every
circumstance
of
callous
ferocity
sent
the
wretched
man
to
that
last
account
which
you
must
shortly
render
for
yourself
of
the
life
of
that
miserable
man
your
victim
it
is
not
for
me
to
speak
nor
for
you
to
think
and
i
do
most
earnestly
beseech
you
to
use
the
short
time
yet
remaining
to
you
on
this
earth
in
true
repentance
and
in
making
your
peace
with
almighty
god
it
is
my
duty
to
pronounce
sentence
of
that
punishment
which
not
i
but
the
law
of
this
country
imposes
for
the
crime
which
you
have
committed
the
sentence
of
the
court
is
that
you
be
taken
to
the
place
whence
you
came
and
thence
to
a
place
of
execution
and
that
you
be
there
hanged
by
the
neck
till
you
be
dead
and
may
the
lord
have
mercy
on
your
soul
it
was
from
the
tall
black
figure
well
well
that
was
over
the
gaoler
touched
his
arm
right
but
first
he
took
a
quick
glance
through
the
glass
partition
hannah
was
falling
over
or
something
a
mere
rusty
swaying
bundle
and
dicky
was
holding
her
up
with
both
arms
dicky
face
was
damp
and
grey
and
twitching
lines
were
in
his
cheeks
josh
took
a
step
toward
the
partition
but
they
hurried
him
away
xxxv
all
this
hard
thinking
would
be
over
in
half
an
hour
or
so
what
was
to
come
now
did
matter
no
more
than
a
mere
punch
in
the
eye
the
worst
was
over
on
saturday
and
he
had
got
through
that
all
right
hannah
was
very
bad
and
so
was
dicky
em
cried
in
a
bewildered
sort
of
way
because
the
others
did
little
josh
conceiving
that
his
father
was
somehow
causing
all
the
tears
kicked
and
swore
at
him
he
tried
to
get
hannah
to
smile
at
this
but
it
was
no
go
and
they
had
to
carry
her
out
at
last
dicky
was
though
bad
as
he
was
he
felt
him
shake
and
choke
when
he
kissed
him
but
he
walked
out
straight
and
steady
with
the
two
children
well
it
was
over
he
hoped
they
would
get
up
a
break
in
the
jago
for
hannah
and
the
youngsters
his
own
break
had
never
come
off
they
owed
him
one
the
last
break
he
was
at
was
at
mother
gapp
before
the
fell
through
the
floor
it
must
have
cost
mother
gapp
a
deal
of
money
to
put
in
the
new
floor
but
then
she
must
have
made
a
lot
in
her
time
what
with
one
thing
and
another
there
was
the
fencing
and
the
houses
she
had
bought
in
honey
lane
and
the
two
fourpenny
in
hoxton
that
they
said
were
hers
and
well
nobody
could
say
what
else
some
said
she
came
of
the
gipsies
that
used
to
live
at
the
mount
years
ago
the
mount
was
a
pretty
thick
place
now
but
not
so
thick
as
the
jago
the
jagos
were
thick
as
glue
and
wide
as
broad
street
bob
the
bender
fell
in
broad
street
and
got
a
stretch
and
a
half
yes
yes
of
course
they
always
tolled
a
bell
but
it
was
rather
confusing
with
things
to
think
about
ah
they
had
come
at
last
come
there
was
nothing
more
to
think
about
now
nothing
but
to
take
it
game
hold
tight
jago
hold
tight
thank
you
sir
nothing
to
say
special
much
obliged
to
ye
thank
ye
kindly
for
the
grub
an
an
bein
kind
an
wot
not
thanks
all
of
ye
come
to
that
specially
you
sir
it
was
the
tall
black
figure
again
what
this
was
the
chap
was
it
sort
of
undertaker
man
to
look
at
all
right
straps
not
cords
to
tie
then
waist
wrists
elbows
more
straps
dangling
below
do
them
presently
this
was
how
they
did
it
then
this
way
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
saith
the
lord
he
that
believeth
in
me
though
he
were
dead
yet
shall
he
live
and
whosoever
liveth
and
believeth
in
me
shall
never
die
a
very
big
gate
this
all
iron
painted
white
round
to
the
right
not
very
far
they
told
him
it
was
dark
in
the
passage
but
the
door
led
into
the
yard
where
it
was
light
and
open
and
sparrows
were
twittering
another
door
in
a
shed
this
was
the
place
all
white
everywhere
frame
too
not
black
after
all
up
the
steps
hold
tight
not
much
longer
stand
there
very
well
that
is
born
of
a
woman
hath
but
a
short
time
to
live
and
is
full
of
misery
he
cometh
up
and
is
cut
down
like
a
flower
he
fleeth
as
it
were
a
shadow
and
never
continueth
in
one
stay
the
midst
of
life
xxxvi
it
was
but
a
little
crowd
that
stood
at
the
old
bailey
corner
while
the
bell
tolled
to
watch
for
the
black
flag
this
was
not
a
popular
murder
josh
perrott
was
not
a
man
who
had
been
bred
to
better
things
he
did
not
snivel
and
rant
in
the
dock
and
he
had
not
butchered
his
wife
nor
his
child
nor
anybody
with
a
claim
on
his
gratitude
or
affection
so
that
nobody
sympathised
with
him
nor
got
up
a
petition
for
pardon
nor
wrote
tearful
letters
to
the
newspapers
and
the
crowd
that
watched
for
the
black
flag
was
a
small
one
and
half
of
it
came
from
the
jago
while
it
was
watching
and
while
the
bell
was
tolling
a
knot
of
people
stood
at
the
perrotts
in
old
jago
street
father
sturt
went
across
as
soon
as
the
sleepers
of
the
night
had
been
seen
away
from
the
shelter
and
spoke
to
kiddo
cook
who
stood
at
the
to
drive
off
intruders
say
she
been
settin
up
all
night
father
kiddo
reported
in
a
hushed
voice
poll
jest
looked
in
at
the
winder
from
walsh
and
says
she
can
see
all
kneelin
round
a
chair
with
that
little
clock
o
theirs
on
it
it
it
an
hour
yut
shall
come
here
myself
presently
and
relieve
you
can
you
wait
you
must
neglect
trade
you
know
wait
all
day
father
if
ye
like
nobody
disturb
when
father
sturt
returned
from
his
errand
you
heard
anything
he
asked
father
answered
kiddo
cook
ai
moved
there
were
two
faint
notes
from
a
distant
steeple
and
then
the
bell
of
st
leonards
beat
out
the
inexorable
hour
xxxvii
kiddo
cook
prospered
the
stall
was
a
present
fact
and
the
awning
was
not
far
off
indeed
he
was
vigilantly
in
search
of
a
one
not
too
much
worn
but
with
all
his
affluence
he
was
not
often
drunk
nothing
could
be
better
than
his
pitch
right
out
in
the
high
street
in
the
busiest
part
and
hard
by
the
london
and
county
branch
bank
they
called
it
kiddo
bank
in
the
jago
and
made
jokes
about
alleged
deposits
of
his
if
you
bought
a
of
greens
from
kiddo
said
facetious
jagos
he
did
condescend
to
take
the
money
himself
he
gave
you
a
slip
of
paper
and
you
paid
at
the
bank
and
kiddo
had
indulged
in
a
stroke
of
magnificence
that
no
other
jago
would
have
thought
of
he
had
taken
rooms
in
the
new
county
council
dwellings
the
secret
was
that
father
sturt
had
agreed
to
marry
kiddo
cook
and
pigeony
poll
there
would
be
plenty
for
both
to
do
what
with
the
stall
and
the
regular
round
with
the
barrow
the
came
when
hannah
perrott
had
been
one
week
a
widow
for
a
few
days
father
sturt
had
left
her
alone
and
had
guarded
her
privacy
then
seeing
that
she
gave
no
sign
he
went
with
what
quiet
comfort
he
might
and
bespoke
her
attention
to
her
concerns
he
invented
some
charing
work
in
his
rooms
for
her
she
did
it
very
badly
and
if
he
left
her
long
alone
she
would
be
found
on
the
floor
with
her
face
in
a
crying
weakly
but
the
work
was
something
for
her
to
do
and
to
think
about
and
by
dint
of
bustling
it
and
magnifying
its
importance
father
sturt
brought
her
to
some
degree
of
mindfulness
and
calm
dicky
walked
that
morning
in
a
sort
of
numb
embittered
fury
what
should
he
do
now
his
devilmost
spare
nobody
and
stop
at
nothing
old
beveridge
was
right
that
morning
years
ago
the
jago
had
got
him
and
it
held
him
fast
now
he
went
doubly
sealed
of
the
outcasts
a
jago
with
a
hanged
father
father
sturt
talked
of
work
but
who
would
give
work
and
why
do
it
in
any
case
what
came
of
it
before
no
he
was
a
jago
and
the
world
enemy
father
sturt
was
the
only
good
man
in
it
as
for
the
rest
he
would
spoil
them
when
he
could
there
was
something
for
night
if
only
he
could
get
calmed
down
enough
by
then
a
builder
yard
in
kingsland
with
an
office
in
a
loft
and
money
in
a
common
desk
tommy
rann
had
found
it
and
they
must
do
it
together
if
only
he
could
get
this
odd
numbness
off
him
and
have
his
head
clear
so
much
crying
perhaps
and
so
much
trying
not
to
till
his
head
was
like
to
burst
and
pale
he
dragged
round
into
edge
lane
and
so
into
new
jago
street
jerry
gullen
canary
was
harnessed
to
the
barrow
and
jerry
himself
was
piling
the
barrow
with
rags
and
bottles
dicky
stood
and
looked
he
thought
he
would
rub
canary
head
but
then
he
changed
his
mind
and
did
not
move
jerry
gullen
glanced
at
him
furtively
once
or
twice
and
then
said
ole
moke
for
wear
ai
dicky
answered
moodily
his
talk
half
random
peg
out
soon
now
not
wy
i
bet
live
you
will
ai
to
die
think
like
to
said
dicky
and
slouched
on
yes
canary
would
be
better
off
dead
so
would
others
it
would
be
a
comfortable
thing
for
himself
if
he
could
die
quietly
then
and
there
but
it
would
never
do
for
mother
and
the
children
to
be
left
helpless
how
good
for
them
all
to
go
off
easily
together
and
wake
in
some
pleasant
place
say
a
place
like
father
sturt
and
perhaps
find
but
there
what
foolishness
what
was
this
unendurable
stupor
that
clung
about
him
like
a
net
he
knew
everything
clearly
enough
but
it
was
all
in
an
atmosphere
of
dull
heedlessness
there
would
be
some
relief
in
doing
something
violent
in
smashing
something
to
little
pieces
with
a
hammer
he
came
to
the
ruined
houses
there
was
a
tumult
of
yells
and
a
crowd
of
thirty
or
forty
lads
went
streaming
across
the
open
waste
waving
sticks
on
come
on
jago
they
are
a
fight
ah
what
more
welcome
and
dove
lane
too
dove
lane
that
had
taken
to
bawling
the
taunt
since
he
was
in
the
thick
of
the
raid
on
jago
jago
they
are
past
the
board
school
and
through
honey
lane
they
went
and
into
dove
lane
territory
a
small
crowd
of
broke
and
fled
straight
ahead
the
jagos
went
till
they
were
suddenly
taken
in
flank
at
a
turning
by
a
full
dove
lane
mob
the
jagos
were
broken
by
the
rush
but
they
fought
stoutly
and
the
street
was
filled
with
a
surge
of
combat
jago
hold
tight
thin
wasted
and
shaken
dicky
fought
like
a
tiger
he
had
no
stick
till
he
floored
a
and
took
his
from
him
but
then
he
bludgeoned
apace
callous
to
every
blow
till
he
fought
through
the
thick
and
burst
out
at
the
edge
of
the
fray
he
pulled
his
cap
tight
and
swung
back
almost
knocking
over
but
disregarding
a
furtive
hunchback
who
turned
and
came
at
his
heels
jago
hold
tight
yelled
dicky
perrott
on
father
boys
he
was
down
just
a
punch
under
the
arm
from
behind
as
he
rolled
face
under
he
caught
a
single
glimpse
of
the
hunchback
running
but
what
was
this
all
this
a
shout
went
up
chived
they
chived
dicky
perrott
the
fight
melted
somebody
turned
dicky
on
his
back
and
he
moaned
and
lay
gasping
he
lifted
his
dabbled
hands
and
looked
at
them
wondering
they
tried
to
lift
him
but
the
blood
poured
so
fast
that
they
put
him
down
somebody
had
gone
for
a
surgeon
me
said
dicky
faintly
with
an
odd
gurgle
in
his
voice
the
surgeon
came
running
with
policemen
at
his
heels
he
ripped
away
the
clothes
from
about
the
wound
and
shook
his
head
it
was
the
lung
water
was
brought
and
cloths
and
an
old
door
they
put
dicky
on
the
door
and
carried
him
toward
the
surgery
and
two
lads
who
stayed
by
him
were
sent
to
bring
his
friends
the
bride
and
bridegroom
meeting
the
news
on
the
way
home
set
off
at
a
run
and
father
sturt
followed
gawd
dicky
cried
poll
tearing
her
way
to
the
shutter
as
it
stopped
at
the
surgery
door
this
dicky
eye
fell
on
the
flowered
bonnet
that
graced
the
wedding
and
his
lip
lifted
with
the
shade
of
a
smile
pidge
he
was
laid
out
in
the
surgery
a
crowd
stood
about
the
door
while
father
sturt
went
in
the
vicar
lifted
his
eyebrows
questioningly
and
the
surgeon
shook
his
head
it
was
a
matter
of
minutes
father
sturt
bent
over
and
took
dicky
hand
poor
dicky
he
said
did
this
the
lie
the
staunch
jago
lie
thou
shalt
not
nark
