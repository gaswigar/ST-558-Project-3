illustration
author
of
the
master
of
the
inn
having
received
many
inquiries
as
to
what
foundation
in
fact
this
tale
has
wishes
to
state
explicitly
that
both
incidents
and
persons
are
purely
imaginary
and
that
so
far
as
he
is
aware
there
is
neither
master
nor
inn
in
may
the
master
of
the
inn
the
master
of
the
inn
i
it
was
a
plain
brick
house
three
full
stories
with
four
broad
chimneys
and
overhanging
eaves
the
tradition
was
that
it
had
been
a
colonial
tavern
a
dot
among
the
northern
hills
on
the
climbing
into
canada
the
village
scattered
along
the
road
below
the
inn
was
called
albany
and
soon
forgotten
when
the
railroad
sought
an
opening
through
a
valley
less
rugged
eight
miles
to
the
west
rather
more
than
thirty
years
ago
the
doctor
had
arrived
one
summer
day
and
opened
all
the
doors
and
windows
of
the
neglected
old
house
which
he
had
bought
from
scattered
heirs
he
was
a
quiet
man
the
doctor
in
middle
life
then
or
nearly
so
and
he
sank
almost
without
remark
into
the
world
of
albany
where
they
raise
hay
and
potatoes
and
still
cut
good
white
pine
off
the
hills
gradually
the
old
brick
tavern
resumed
the
functions
of
life
many
buildings
were
added
to
it
as
well
as
many
acres
of
farm
and
forest
to
the
doctor
original
purchase
of
intervale
land
the
new
master
did
not
open
his
house
to
the
public
yet
he
too
kept
a
sort
of
inn
where
men
came
and
stayed
a
long
time
although
no
sign
now
hung
from
the
old
elm
tree
in
front
of
the
house
nevertheless
an
stream
of
humanity
mounted
the
winding
road
from
white
river
and
passed
through
the
doors
of
the
inn
seeking
life
that
first
summer
the
doctor
brought
with
him
sam
the
chinaman
whom
we
all
came
to
know
and
love
and
also
a
young
man
who
loafed
much
while
the
doctor
worked
and
occasionally
fished
this
was
john
herring
now
a
famous
architect
and
it
was
from
his
designs
sketched
those
first
idle
summer
days
that
were
built
all
the
additions
to
the
simple
old
house
the
two
low
wings
in
the
rear
for
the
cells
with
the
italian
garden
between
them
the
marble
seat
curving
around
the
pool
that
joined
the
wings
on
the
west
also
the
substantial
wall
that
hid
the
inn
its
terraced
gardens
and
orchards
from
albanian
curiosity
herring
found
a
store
of
red
brick
in
some
crumbling
buildings
in
the
neighborhood
and
he
discovered
the
quarry
whence
came
those
thick
slabs
of
purple
slate
the
marble
was
had
from
a
fissure
in
the
hills
and
the
doctor
school
made
the
tiles
i
think
herring
never
did
better
work
than
in
the
making
over
of
this
old
tavern
he
divined
that
subtle
affinity
which
exists
between
north
italy
with
all
its
art
and
our
bare
new
england
and
he
dared
to
graft
boldly
one
to
the
other
having
the
rear
of
the
inn
altogether
italian
with
its
portico
its
dainty
colonnades
the
garden
and
the
fountain
and
the
pool
from
all
this
one
looked
down
on
the
waving
grass
of
the
intervale
which
fell
away
gently
to
the
turbulent
white
river
then
rose
again
to
the
wooded
hills
that
folded
one
upon
another
with
ever
deepening
blue
always
upward
and
beyond
not
all
this
building
at
once
to
be
sure
as
the
millionaire
builds
but
a
gradual
growth
over
a
couple
of
decades
and
all
built
lovingly
by
the
brothers
stone
on
stone
brick
and
beam
and
tile
many
a
hand
taking
part
in
it
that
came
weak
to
the
task
and
left
it
sturdy
there
was
also
the
terraced
arrangement
of
gardens
and
orchards
on
either
side
of
the
inn
reaching
to
the
farm
buildings
on
the
one
side
and
to
the
village
on
the
other
for
a
time
herring
respected
the
quaint
old
tavern
with
its
small
rooms
and
pine
wainscot
then
he
made
a
stately
hall
out
of
one
half
where
we
dined
in
bad
weather
and
a
pleasant
study
for
the
doctor
from
the
rest
the
doors
east
and
west
always
stood
open
in
the
summer
giving
the
rare
a
glimpse
of
that
radiant
blue
heaven
among
the
hills
with
the
silver
flash
of
the
river
in
the
middle
distance
and
a
little
square
of
peaceful
garden
close
at
hand
the
tough
northern
grasses
rustled
in
the
breezes
that
always
played
about
albany
and
the
scent
of
spruce
drawn
by
the
hot
sun
the
strong
resinous
breath
of
the
north
was
borne
from
the
woods
thus
it
started
that
household
of
men
in
the
old
inn
at
the
far
end
of
albany
village
among
the
northern
hills
with
the
doctor
and
sam
and
herring
who
had
been
flung
aside
after
his
first
skirmish
with
life
and
was
picked
up
in
pure
kindness
by
the
doctor
as
a
bit
of
the
broken
waste
of
our
modern
world
and
carried
off
with
him
out
of
the
city
the
young
architect
returning
in
due
time
to
the
fight
singing
naturally
venerated
the
doctor
as
a
father
and
when
a
dear
friend
stumbled
and
fell
in
the
of
this
life
he
whispered
to
him
word
of
the
inn
and
its
master
of
the
life
up
there
among
the
hills
where
man
is
little
and
god
looks
down
on
his
earth
oh
you
understand
when
you
put
your
eyes
on
white
face
some
morning
the
doctor
he
heals
both
body
and
soul
and
this
one
having
heeded
spoke
the
word
in
turn
to
others
in
need
to
the
right
sort
who
would
understand
thus
the
custom
grew
like
a
faith
and
a
kind
of
brotherhood
was
formed
of
those
who
had
found
more
than
health
at
the
inn
who
had
found
themselves
the
doctor
ever
busy
about
his
farms
and
his
woods
his
building
and
above
all
his
school
soon
had
on
his
hands
a
dozen
or
more
patients
or
guests
as
you
might
call
them
and
he
set
them
to
work
speedily
there
was
little
medicine
to
be
found
in
the
inn
the
sick
labored
as
they
could
and
thus
grew
strong
and
so
as
one
was
added
to
another
they
began
to
call
themselves
in
joke
brothers
and
the
doctor
father
the
older
brothers
would
return
to
the
inn
from
all
parts
of
the
land
for
a
few
days
or
a
few
weeks
to
grasp
the
doctor
hand
to
have
a
dip
in
the
pool
to
try
the
little
brooks
among
the
hills
young
men
and
and
even
the
old
they
came
from
the
cities
where
the
heat
of
living
had
scorched
them
where
they
had
faltered
and
doubted
the
goodness
of
life
in
some
way
word
of
the
master
had
reached
them
with
this
compelling
advice
go
and
tell
him
i
sent
you
so
from
the
clinic
or
the
from
the
office
or
the
mill
wherever
men
labor
with
tightening
nerves
the
needy
one
started
on
his
long
journey
toward
evening
he
was
set
down
before
the
plain
red
face
of
the
inn
and
as
the
stranger
entered
the
old
hall
a
voice
was
sure
to
greet
him
from
within
somewhere
the
deep
voice
of
a
hearty
man
and
presently
the
master
appeared
to
welcome
the
newcomer
resting
one
hand
on
his
shoulder
perhaps
with
a
yearning
affection
that
ran
before
knowledge
so
you
come
my
boy
he
said
herring
or
some
one
wrote
me
to
look
for
you
and
after
a
few
more
words
of
greeting
the
doctor
beckoned
to
sam
and
gave
the
guest
over
to
his
hands
thereupon
the
chinaman
slippered
through
tiled
passageways
to
the
court
where
the
stranger
caught
by
the
beauty
and
peace
so
well
hidden
lingered
a
while
the
little
space
within
the
wings
was
filled
with
flowers
as
far
as
the
yellow
water
of
the
pool
and
the
marble
bench
in
the
centre
of
the
court
was
an
old
gray
fountain
sent
from
verona
by
a
brother
from
which
the
water
dropped
and
ran
away
among
the
flower
beds
to
the
pool
a
stately
elm
tree
shaded
this
place
flecking
the
water
below
the
sun
shot
long
rays
beneath
its
branches
into
the
court
and
over
all
there
was
an
odor
of
blossoming
flowers
and
the
murmur
of
bees
bath
sam
explained
grinning
toward
the
pool
with
the
trickle
of
the
fountain
in
his
ears
the
stranger
looked
out
across
the
ripening
fields
of
the
intervale
to
the
noble
of
the
stowe
hills
those
little
mountains
of
the
north
mere
hills
to
all
who
know
the
giants
of
the
earth
not
mountains
in
the
brotherhood
of
ice
and
snow
and
rock
but
in
form
and
color
in
the
lesser
things
that
create
the
love
of
men
for
places
they
rise
nobly
toward
heaven
those
little
hills
on
a
summer
day
like
this
their
broad
breasts
flutter
with
waving
and
at
evening
depth
on
depth
of
purple
mist
gathers
over
them
dropping
into
those
soft
curves
where
the
little
brooks
flow
and
mounting
even
to
the
when
the
sun
has
fallen
there
rests
a
band
of
pure
saffron
and
in
the
calm
and
perfect
peace
of
evening
there
is
a
hint
of
coming
moonlight
ah
they
are
of
the
fellowship
of
mountains
those
little
hills
of
stowe
and
when
in
winter
their
flanks
are
jewelled
with
ice
and
snow
then
they
raise
their
heads
proudly
to
the
stars
calling
across
the
frozen
valleys
to
their
greater
brethren
in
the
midriff
of
the
continent
behold
we
also
are
hills
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
meantime
sam
with
oriental
ease
goes
slipping
along
the
arcade
until
he
comes
to
a
certain
oak
door
where
he
drops
your
bag
and
disappears
having
saluted
it
is
an
ample
and
lofty
room
and
on
the
outer
side
of
it
hangs
a
little
balcony
above
the
orchard
from
which
there
is
a
view
of
the
valley
and
the
woods
beyond
and
from
somewhere
in
the
fields
the
note
of
the
thrush
rises
the
room
itself
is
cool
of
a
gray
tone
with
a
broad
fireplace
a
heavy
table
and
many
books
otherwise
there
are
bed
and
chairs
and
the
necessities
of
life
austerely
provided
and
peace
god
what
peace
to
him
who
has
escaped
from
the
furnace
men
make
it
is
as
if
he
had
come
all
the
way
to
the
end
of
the
world
and
found
there
a
great
still
room
of
peace
soon
a
bell
sounds
with
a
strange
vibration
as
though
in
distant
lands
it
had
summoned
many
a
body
of
men
together
and
the
household
assembles
under
the
arcade
if
it
is
fair
and
not
cold
sam
and
his
helpers
bring
out
the
long
narrow
table
and
place
it
as
veronese
places
his
feasters
lengthwise
beneath
the
colonnade
and
thus
the
evening
meal
is
served
a
fresh
coarse
napkin
is
laid
on
the
bare
board
before
each
man
no
more
than
enough
for
all
those
present
and
the
doctor
sits
in
the
middle
serving
all
there
are
few
dishes
and
for
the
most
part
such
as
may
be
got
at
home
there
in
the
hills
there
is
a
pitcher
of
cider
at
one
end
and
a
pitcher
of
mild
white
wine
at
the
other
and
the
men
eat
and
drink
with
jokes
and
talk
the
laughter
of
the
day
the
novice
might
feel
only
the
harmony
of
it
all
but
later
he
will
learn
how
many
considered
elements
go
to
the
making
of
peace
afterward
when
sam
has
brought
pipes
and
tobacco
the
master
leads
the
way
to
the
sweeping
semicircle
of
marble
seat
around
the
pool
with
the
leafy
tree
overhead
and
there
they
sit
into
the
soft
night
talking
of
all
things
with
the
glow
of
pipes
until
one
after
another
slips
away
to
sleep
for
as
the
master
said
talk
among
men
in
common
softens
the
muscles
of
the
mind
and
quickens
the
heart
yet
he
loved
most
to
hear
the
talk
of
others
thus
insensibly
for
the
novice
there
begins
the
life
of
the
place
opening
in
a
gentle
and
persistent
routine
that
takes
him
in
its
flow
and
carries
him
on
with
it
he
finds
tradition
and
habit
all
about
him
in
the
ordered
unconscious
life
of
the
inn
to
which
he
yields
without
question
shortly
after
dawn
the
bell
sounds
and
then
the
men
meet
at
the
pool
where
the
doctor
is
always
first
a
plunge
into
the
yellow
water
which
is
flecked
with
the
fallen
leaves
and
afterward
to
each
man
room
there
is
brought
a
large
bowl
of
coffee
and
hot
milk
with
bread
and
eggs
and
fruit
what
more
he
craves
may
be
found
in
the
hall
soon
there
is
a
tap
on
the
newcomer
door
and
a
neighborly
voice
calls
out
we
all
go
into
the
fields
every
morning
you
know
you
must
earn
your
dinner
the
doctor
says
or
borrow
it
so
the
novice
goes
forth
to
earn
his
first
dinner
with
his
hands
beyond
the
gardens
and
the
orchards
are
the
barns
and
sheds
and
a
vista
of
level
acres
of
hay
and
potatoes
and
rye
the
bearing
acres
of
the
farm
and
beyond
these
the
woods
on
the
hills
nearly
a
thousand
acres
fields
and
woods
the
neighbor
explains
oh
there
plenty
to
do
all
times
meantime
the
doctor
strides
ahead
through
the
wet
grass
his
eyes
roaming
here
and
there
inquiring
the
state
of
his
land
and
watching
him
the
newcomer
believes
that
there
is
always
much
to
be
done
wherever
the
doctor
leads
it
may
be
july
and
hay
time
all
the
intervale
grass
land
is
mowed
by
hand
there
is
a
task
or
it
may
be
potatoes
to
hoe
or
later
in
the
season
the
apples
have
to
be
gathered
a
pleasant
pungent
job
filling
the
baskets
and
pouring
them
into
the
barrels
but
whatever
the
work
may
be
the
doctor
keeps
the
novice
in
his
mind
and
as
the
sun
climbs
high
over
the
stowe
hills
he
taps
the
new
one
on
the
shoulder
better
stop
here
my
boy
you
find
a
good
tree
over
there
by
the
brook
for
a
nap
under
that
particular
tree
in
the
tall
timothy
there
is
the
coolest
spot
and
the
novice
drowses
thinking
of
those
wonderful
mowers
in
as
he
gazes
at
the
marching
files
eating
their
way
through
the
meadow
until
his
eyelids
fall
and
he
sleeps
the
ripple
of
waving
timothy
in
his
ears
at
noon
the
bell
sounds
again
from
the
inn
and
the
men
come
striding
homeward
wiping
the
sweat
from
their
faces
they
gather
at
the
swimming
pool
and
still
panting
from
their
labor
strip
off
their
wet
garments
then
plunge
one
after
another
like
happy
boys
from
bath
to
room
and
a
few
minutes
for
fresh
clothes
and
all
troop
into
the
hall
which
is
dark
and
cool
the
old
brick
walls
of
the
tavern
never
held
a
gayer
lot
of
guests
from
this
time
on
each
one
is
his
own
master
there
is
no
common
toil
the
farmer
and
his
men
take
up
the
care
of
the
farm
and
the
master
usually
goes
down
to
his
school
in
company
with
some
of
the
brothers
each
one
finds
his
own
way
of
spending
the
hours
till
sunset
some
fishing
or
shooting
according
to
the
season
others
in
tennis
or
games
with
the
boys
of
the
school
and
some
reading
or
loafing
until
the
shadows
begin
to
fall
across
the
pool
into
the
court
and
sam
brings
out
the
long
table
for
dinner
the
seasons
shading
imperceptibly
into
one
another
vary
the
course
of
the
day
early
in
september
the
men
begin
to
sit
long
about
the
of
an
evening
and
when
the
snow
packs
hard
on
the
hills
there
is
to
be
done
and
in
early
spring
it
is
the
shop
so
the
form
alters
but
the
substance
remains
work
and
play
and
rest
to
each
one
a
time
will
come
when
the
doctor
speaks
to
him
alone
at
some
hour
before
many
days
have
passed
the
novice
will
find
himself
with
those
large
eyes
resting
on
his
face
searchingly
it
may
be
in
the
study
after
the
others
have
scattered
or
at
the
pool
where
the
master
loved
to
sit
beneath
the
great
tree
and
hear
his
confessions
as
the
men
called
these
talks
at
such
times
when
the
man
came
to
remember
it
afterward
the
doctor
asked
few
questions
said
little
but
listened
he
had
the
confessing
ear
and
as
if
by
chance
his
hand
would
rest
on
the
man
arm
or
shoulder
for
he
said
touch
speaks
soul
flows
through
flesh
into
soul
thus
he
sat
and
confessed
his
patients
one
after
another
and
his
dark
eyes
seemed
familiar
with
all
man
woes
as
if
he
had
listened
always
men
said
to
him
what
they
had
never
before
let
pass
their
lips
to
man
or
woman
what
they
themselves
scarce
looked
at
in
the
gloom
of
their
souls
unawares
it
slipped
from
them
the
reason
within
the
reason
for
their
ill
the
ultimate
cause
of
sorrow
from
the
moment
they
had
revealed
to
him
this
hidden
thing
had
slipped
the
leash
on
their
tongues
it
seemed
no
longer
to
be
feared
trouble
evaporates
being
properly
aired
said
the
doctor
and
already
in
the
troubled
one
mind
the
sense
of
the
confused
snarl
of
life
began
to
lessen
and
veils
began
to
descend
between
him
and
it
for
you
must
learn
to
forget
counselled
the
doctor
forget
day
by
day
until
the
recording
soul
beneath
your
mind
is
clean
therefore
work
forget
be
new
a
young
man
much
concerned
with
himself
once
asked
the
master
doctor
what
is
the
regimen
that
you
would
recommend
to
me
and
we
all
heard
him
say
in
reply
the
potatoes
need
hilling
and
then
you
feel
like
having
a
dip
in
the
pool
the
young
man
it
seems
wrote
back
to
the
friend
in
the
city
who
had
sent
him
this
doctor
can
not
understand
my
case
he
tells
me
to
dig
potatoes
and
bathe
in
a
swimming
pool
that
is
all
all
but
the
friend
who
was
an
old
member
of
the
brotherhood
telegraphed
back
dig
and
swim
you
fool
sam
took
the
message
at
the
telephone
while
we
were
dining
and
repeated
it
faithfully
to
the
young
man
within
the
hearing
of
all
a
laugh
rose
that
was
hard
in
dying
and
i
think
the
lips
wreathed
in
smile
in
the
old
days
they
say
the
master
gave
medicine
like
other
doctors
that
was
when
he
spent
part
of
the
year
in
the
city
and
had
an
office
there
and
believed
in
drugs
but
as
he
gave
up
going
to
the
city
the
stock
of
drugs
in
the
cabinet
at
the
end
of
the
study
became
exhausted
and
was
never
renewed
all
who
needed
medicine
were
sent
to
an
old
brother
who
had
settled
down
the
valley
at
stowe
he
knows
more
about
pills
than
i
do
the
doctor
said
at
least
he
can
give
you
the
stuff
with
confidence
few
of
the
inmates
of
the
inn
ever
went
to
stowe
though
williams
was
an
excellent
physician
and
it
was
from
about
this
time
that
we
began
to
drop
the
title
of
doctor
calling
him
instead
the
master
and
the
younger
men
sometimes
father
he
seemed
to
like
these
new
terms
as
denoting
affection
and
respect
for
his
authority
by
the
time
that
we
called
him
master
the
inn
had
come
to
its
maturity
altogether
it
could
hold
eighteen
guests
and
if
more
came
as
in
midsummer
or
autumn
they
lived
in
tents
in
the
orchard
or
in
the
hill
camps
the
master
was
still
adding
to
the
forest
land
fish
and
game
preserve
the
village
people
called
it
for
the
master
was
a
hunter
and
a
fisherman
but
up
among
those
curving
hills
when
he
looked
out
through
the
waving
trees
measuring
by
eye
a
fir
or
a
pine
he
would
say
nodding
his
head
boys
behold
my
heirs
from
generation
to
generation
he
was
now
fifty
and
had
ceased
altogether
to
go
to
the
city
there
were
ripe
men
in
the
great
hospitals
that
still
remembered
him
as
a
young
man
in
the
medical
school
but
he
had
dropped
out
they
said
why
he
might
have
answered
that
instead
of
following
the
beaten
path
he
had
spoken
his
word
to
the
world
through
men
and
spoken
widely
for
there
was
no
break
in
the
stream
of
life
that
flowed
upward
to
the
old
inn
the
cells
were
always
full
winter
and
summer
now
there
were
coming
children
of
the
older
brothers
and
these
having
learned
the
ways
of
the
place
from
their
fathers
were
already
as
we
said
when
they
came
they
knew
that
no
door
was
locked
about
the
inn
but
that
if
they
returned
after
ten
it
behooved
them
to
come
in
by
the
pool
and
make
no
noise
they
knew
that
when
the
first
ice
formed
on
the
pool
then
they
were
not
expected
to
get
out
of
bed
for
the
morning
plunge
they
knew
that
there
was
an
old
custom
which
no
one
ever
forgot
and
that
was
to
put
money
in
the
behind
the
hall
door
on
leaving
at
least
something
for
each
day
of
the
time
spent
and
as
much
more
as
one
cared
to
give
for
as
everyone
knew
all
in
the
box
beyond
the
daily
expense
went
to
maintain
the
school
on
the
road
below
the
village
so
the
books
of
the
inn
were
easy
to
keep
there
was
never
a
word
about
money
in
the
place
but
i
know
that
many
a
large
sum
of
money
was
found
in
this
box
and
the
school
never
wanted
means
that
i
might
tell
more
of
what
took
place
in
the
inn
and
what
the
master
said
and
the
sort
of
men
one
found
there
and
the
talk
we
all
had
summer
evenings
beside
the
pool
and
winter
nights
in
the
hall
winter
i
think
was
the
best
time
of
all
the
year
the
greatest
beauty
and
the
greatest
joy
from
the
first
fall
of
the
snow
to
the
yellow
brook
water
and
the
floating
ice
in
white
river
then
the
broad
velvety
shadows
lay
on
the
hills
between
the
stiff
spruces
then
came
rosy
mornings
out
of
darkness
when
you
knew
that
some
good
thing
was
waiting
for
you
in
the
world
after
you
had
drunk
your
bowl
of
coffee
you
got
your
axe
and
followed
the
procession
of
choppers
who
were
carefully
foresting
the
doctor
woods
in
the
spring
when
the
little
brooks
had
begun
to
run
down
the
slopes
there
was
road
making
and
mending
for
the
master
kept
in
repair
most
of
the
roads
about
albany
grinding
the
rock
in
his
pit
saying
that
a
good
road
is
one
sure
blessing
and
the
dusks
i
shall
never
forget
those
gold
and
violet
moments
with
the
light
of
immortal
heavens
behind
the
rampart
of
hills
and
the
nights
so
still
so
still
like
everlasting
death
each
star
set
in
a
black
sky
above
a
white
earth
how
splendid
it
was
to
turn
out
of
the
warm
hall
where
we
had
been
reading
and
talking
in
to
the
frosty
court
with
the
thermometer
at
twenty
below
and
still
falling
and
look
down
across
the
broad
white
valley
marked
by
the
streak
of
bushy
alders
where
the
dumb
river
flowed
up
to
the
little
frozen
water
courses
among
the
hills
up
above
where
the
stars
glittered
you
took
your
way
to
your
room
in
the
silence
rejoicing
that
it
was
all
so
that
somewhere
in
this
tumultuous
world
of
ours
there
was
hidden
all
this
beauty
and
the
secret
of
living
and
that
you
were
of
the
brotherhood
of
those
who
had
found
it
thus
was
the
inn
and
its
master
in
the
year
when
he
touched
sixty
and
his
hair
and
beard
were
more
white
than
gray
ii
then
there
came
to
the
inn
one
day
in
the
early
part
of
the
summer
a
new
guest
a
man
about
fifty
with
an
aging
worldly
face
bill
the
albany
stage
man
had
brought
him
from
island
junction
and
on
the
way
had
answered
all
his
questions
discreetly
reckoning
in
his
wisdom
that
his
passenger
was
one
of
those
queer
folks
that
went
up
to
the
old
place
for
there
was
something
smart
and
fashionable
about
the
stranger
appearance
that
made
bill
uncomfortable
there
he
said
as
he
pulled
up
outside
the
red
brick
house
and
pointed
over
the
wall
into
the
garden
mos
likely
you
find
the
old
man
fussin
somewheres
inside
there
if
he
hai
down
to
the
school
and
he
drove
off
with
the
people
mail
the
stranger
looked
back
through
the
village
street
which
was
as
silent
as
a
village
street
should
be
at
four
on
a
summer
day
then
he
muttered
to
himself
whimsically
mos
likely
you
find
the
old
man
fussin
somewheres
inside
well
and
he
glanced
at
the
homely
red
brick
building
with
the
cold
eye
of
one
who
has
made
many
goings
out
and
comings
in
and
to
whom
novelty
offers
little
entertainment
as
he
stood
there
thinking
possibly
of
that
early
train
from
the
junction
on
the
morrow
the
hall
door
opened
wide
and
an
oldish
man
with
white
and
black
eyes
appeared
he
was
dressed
in
a
linen
suit
that
deepened
the
dark
tan
of
his
face
and
hands
he
said
you
are
augustus
norton
and
you
the
stranger
replied
with
a
graceful
smile
are
the
master
and
this
is
the
inn
he
had
forgotten
what
percival
called
the
old
boy
forgot
everything
these
days
had
tried
to
remember
the
name
all
the
way
up
nevertheless
he
had
turned
it
off
well
so
the
two
looked
at
each
other
one
a
little
younger
as
years
go
but
with
lined
face
and
shaking
fingers
the
other
solid
and
with
less
of
that
ready
language
which
comes
from
always
jostling
with
nimble
wits
but
as
they
stood
there
each
saw
a
man
and
an
equal
the
great
surgeon
of
jerome
said
our
master
in
further
welcome
honored
by
praise
from
your
lips
thus
the
man
of
the
city
lightly
turned
the
compliment
and
extended
his
hand
which
the
master
took
slowly
gazing
meanwhile
steadily
at
his
guest
pray
come
into
my
house
said
the
master
of
the
inn
with
more
stateliness
of
manner
than
he
usually
had
with
a
new
brother
but
it
may
be
said
augustus
norton
had
the
most
distinguished
name
of
that
day
in
his
profession
he
followed
the
master
to
his
study
with
uncertain
steps
and
sinking
into
a
deep
chair
before
the
smouldering
ashes
looked
at
his
host
with
a
sad
grin
perhaps
you
give
me
something
the
journey
you
know
two
years
before
the
head
surgeon
of
jerome
had
come
to
the
hospital
of
a
morning
to
perform
some
operation
one
of
those
affairs
for
which
he
was
known
from
coast
to
coast
as
he
entered
the
room
that
day
with
the
arrogant
eye
of
the
one
of
his
aides
looked
at
him
suspiciously
then
glanced
again
and
the
great
surgeon
felt
those
eyes
upon
him
when
he
turned
his
back
and
he
knew
why
something
was
wrong
with
him
nevertheless
in
glum
silence
he
made
ready
to
operate
but
when
the
moment
came
and
he
was
about
to
take
the
part
of
god
toward
the
piece
of
flesh
lying
in
the
ether
sleep
before
him
he
hesitated
then
in
the
terrible
recoil
of
fear
he
turned
back
macroe
he
cried
to
his
assistant
you
will
have
to
operate
i
can
not
i
am
not
well
there
was
almost
panic
but
macroe
was
a
man
too
and
proceeded
to
do
his
work
without
a
word
the
great
surgeon
his
hands
now
trembling
beyond
disguise
went
back
to
the
officers
room
took
off
his
white
robes
and
returned
to
his
home
there
he
wrote
his
resignation
to
the
directors
of
jerome
and
his
resignation
from
other
offices
of
honor
and
responsibility
then
he
sent
for
a
medical
man
an
old
friend
and
held
out
his
shaking
hand
to
him
the
damn
thing
wo
go
he
said
pointing
also
to
his
head
too
much
work
the
doctor
replied
of
course
but
the
great
surgeon
who
was
a
man
of
clear
views
added
impersonally
too
much
everything
i
guess
there
followed
the
usual
prescription
making
the
sick
man
a
wanderer
and
pariah
first
to
europe
to
get
rid
of
me
the
surgeon
growled
then
to
georgia
for
golf
to
montana
for
elk
to
canada
for
salmon
and
so
forth
each
time
the
sick
man
returned
with
a
thin
coat
of
tan
that
peeled
off
in
a
few
days
and
with
those
shaking
hands
that
suggested
immediately
another
journey
to
another
climate
until
it
happened
finally
that
the
men
of
jerome
who
had
first
talked
of
the
date
of
their
chief
return
merely
raised
their
eyebrows
at
the
mention
of
his
name
done
for
poor
old
boy
and
the
great
surgeon
read
it
with
his
lynx
eyes
in
the
faces
of
the
men
he
met
at
his
clubs
his
mouth
drew
together
sourly
and
his
back
sloped
he
muttered
god
that
is
too
early
something
ought
to
pull
me
together
so
he
went
on
trying
this
and
that
while
his
friends
said
he
was
resting
until
he
had
slipped
from
men
thoughts
one
day
percival
of
jerome
one
of
those
boys
he
had
growled
at
and
cursed
in
former
times
met
him
crawling
down
the
avenue
to
his
quietest
club
and
the
old
surgeon
took
him
by
the
arm
he
was
gray
in
face
and
his
neck
was
wasting
away
and
told
the
story
of
his
troubles
as
he
would
to
anyone
these
days
the
young
man
listened
respectfully
then
he
spoke
of
the
old
inn
of
the
brotherhood
of
the
master
and
what
he
had
done
for
miserable
men
who
had
despaired
the
famous
surgeon
shaking
his
head
as
one
who
has
heard
of
these
miracles
many
times
and
found
them
naught
was
drinking
it
all
in
nevertheless
he
takes
a
man
said
the
young
surgeon
who
does
want
to
live
and
makes
him
fall
in
love
with
life
augustus
norton
sniffed
in
love
with
life
that
good
if
your
wonder
of
the
ages
can
make
a
man
of
fifty
fall
in
love
with
anything
i
must
try
him
he
laughed
a
sneering
laugh
the
feeble
merriment
of
doubt
ah
doctor
cried
the
young
man
you
must
go
and
live
with
the
master
and
then
come
back
to
us
at
jerome
for
we
need
you
and
the
great
surgeon
touched
to
the
heart
by
these
last
words
said
well
what
the
name
of
your
and
where
is
he
to
be
found
i
might
as
well
try
all
the
cures
write
a
book
on
one
of
these
days
so
he
came
by
the
stage
to
the
gate
of
the
old
inn
and
the
master
who
had
been
warned
by
a
telegram
from
the
young
doctor
only
that
morning
stood
at
his
door
to
welcome
his
celebrated
guest
he
put
him
in
the
room
of
state
above
the
study
a
great
square
room
at
the
southwest
overlooking
the
wings
and
the
garden
the
pool
and
the
waving
grass
fields
beyond
dotted
with
tall
elms
all
freshly
green
not
a
bad
sort
of
place
murmured
the
weary
man
and
there
must
be
trout
in
those
brooks
up
yonder
well
it
will
do
for
a
week
or
two
if
there
then
the
bell
sounded
for
dinner
which
was
served
for
the
first
time
that
season
out
of
doors
in
the
soft
twilight
the
brothers
had
gathered
in
the
court
beside
the
fountain
young
men
and
all
having
bent
under
some
burden
which
they
were
now
learning
to
carry
easily
they
stood
about
the
hall
door
until
the
distinguished
stranger
appeared
and
he
walked
between
them
to
the
place
of
honor
at
the
master
side
everyone
at
the
long
table
was
named
to
the
great
surgeon
and
then
with
the
coming
of
the
soup
he
was
promptly
forgotten
while
the
talk
of
the
day
work
and
the
morrow
rose
vigorously
from
all
sides
it
was
a
question
of
the
old
mill
which
had
given
way
an
engineer
among
the
company
described
what
would
have
to
be
done
to
get
at
the
foundations
and
a
young
man
who
happened
to
sit
next
to
the
surgeon
explained
that
the
master
had
reopened
an
old
mill
above
the
inn
in
the
intervale
where
he
ground
corn
and
wheat
and
rye
with
the
old
for
the
country
people
who
had
always
got
their
grain
ground
there
complained
when
the
mill
had
been
closed
it
seemed
to
the
stranger
that
the
dark
coarse
bread
which
was
served
was
extraordinarily
good
and
he
wondered
if
the
ancient
process
had
anything
to
do
with
it
and
he
resolved
to
see
the
old
mill
then
the
young
man
said
something
about
bass
there
was
a
cool
lake
up
the
valley
which
had
been
stocked
the
surgeon
eye
gleamed
did
he
know
how
to
fish
for
bass
why
before
this
boy
yes
he
would
go
at
five
in
the
morning
sharp
after
the
meal
while
the
blue
wreaths
of
smoke
floated
across
the
flowers
and
the
talk
rose
and
fell
in
the
court
the
master
and
his
new
guest
were
seated
alone
beneath
the
great
elm
the
surgeon
could
trace
the
master
face
in
the
still
waters
of
the
pool
at
their
feet
and
it
seemed
to
him
like
a
finely
cut
cameo
with
gentle
lines
about
the
mouth
and
eyes
that
relieved
the
thick
nose
nevertheless
he
knew
by
certain
instinct
that
they
were
not
of
the
same
kind
the
master
was
very
silent
this
night
and
his
guest
felt
that
some
mystery
some
vacuum
existed
between
them
as
he
gazed
on
the
face
in
the
water
it
was
as
if
the
old
man
were
holding
him
off
at
length
while
he
looked
into
him
but
the
great
surgeon
who
was
used
to
the
amenities
of
city
life
resolved
to
make
his
host
talk
extraordinary
sort
of
place
you
have
here
i
do
know
that
i
have
ever
seen
anything
just
like
it
and
what
is
your
system
what
is
my
system
repeated
the
master
wonderingly
yes
your
method
of
building
these
fellows
up
electricity
diet
massage
baths
what
is
your
line
an
urbane
smile
removed
the
offence
of
the
banter
i
have
no
system
the
master
replied
thoughtfully
i
live
my
life
here
with
my
work
and
those
you
see
come
and
live
with
me
as
my
friends
ah
but
you
have
ideas
extraordinary
success
so
many
cases
the
great
man
muttered
confused
by
the
master
steady
gaze
you
will
learn
more
about
us
after
you
have
been
here
a
little
time
you
will
see
and
the
others
will
help
you
to
understand
we
work
at
the
mill
and
the
next
day
we
shall
be
in
the
gardens
but
you
may
be
too
tired
to
join
us
and
we
bathe
here
morning
and
noon
harvey
will
tell
you
all
our
customs
the
celebrated
surgeon
of
jerome
wrote
that
night
to
an
old
friend
and
the
learned
doctor
prescription
seems
to
be
to
dig
in
the
garden
and
bathe
in
a
great
pool
a
daffy
sort
of
place
but
i
am
going
bass
fishing
at
five
with
a
young
man
who
is
just
the
right
age
for
a
son
so
to
bed
but
i
suspect
that
i
shall
see
you
soon
novelties
wear
out
quickly
at
my
years
just
here
there
entered
that
lovely
night
wind
rising
far
away
beyond
the
low
lakes
to
the
south
it
soughed
through
the
room
swaying
the
draperies
sighing
sighing
and
it
blew
out
the
candle
the
sick
man
looked
down
on
the
court
below
white
in
the
moonlight
and
his
eyes
roved
farther
to
the
dark
orchard
and
the
great
barns
and
the
huddled
cattle
quite
a
bit
of
country
here
the
surgeon
murmured
as
he
stood
there
looking
into
the
misty
light
which
covered
the
intervale
up
to
the
great
hills
above
which
floated
luminous
cloud
banks
the
chorus
of
an
old
song
rose
from
below
where
the
pipes
gleamed
in
the
dark
about
the
pool
he
leaned
out
into
the
air
filled
with
all
the
wild
scent
of
green
fields
and
added
under
a
sort
of
compulsion
and
a
good
place
enough
he
went
to
bed
to
a
deep
sleep
and
over
his
tired
worldly
face
the
night
wind
passed
gently
stripping
leaf
by
leaf
from
his
weary
mind
that
heavy
coating
of
care
which
he
had
wrapped
about
him
in
the
course
of
many
years
augustus
norton
did
not
return
at
the
end
of
one
week
nor
of
two
the
city
saw
him
indeed
no
more
that
year
it
was
said
that
a
frisky
rosy
ghost
of
the
great
surgeon
had
slipped
into
jerome
near
christmas
had
skipped
through
a
club
or
two
and
shaken
hands
about
pretty
generally
and
disappeared
sometimes
letters
came
from
him
with
an
postmark
on
them
saying
in
a
jesting
tone
that
he
was
studying
the
methods
of
an
extraordinary
country
doctor
who
seemed
to
cure
men
by
touch
he
lives
up
here
among
the
hills
in
forty
degrees
of
frost
and
if
i
am
not
mistaken
he
is
nearer
the
secret
than
all
of
you
pill
slingers
for
he
was
writing
a
mere
doctor
of
medicine
anyhow
i
shall
stay
on
until
i
learn
the
secret
or
my
host
turns
me
out
for
life
up
here
seems
as
good
to
me
as
and
kisses
to
a
girl
of
sixteen
why
should
i
go
back
mucking
about
with
you
fellows
just
yet
i
caught
a
yesterday
and
him
there
are
many
stories
of
the
great
surgeon
that
have
come
to
me
from
those
days
he
was
much
liked
especially
by
the
younger
men
after
the
first
gloom
had
worn
off
and
he
began
to
feel
the
blood
run
once
more
he
had
a
joking
way
with
him
that
made
him
a
good
table
companion
and
the
brothers
pretending
that
he
would
become
the
historian
of
the
order
taught
him
all
the
traditions
of
the
place
but
the
secret
the
secret
where
is
it
he
would
demand
jestingly
one
night
it
was
at
table
and
all
were
there
harvey
asked
him
has
the
master
confessed
you
me
repeated
the
surgeon
what
that
a
sudden
silence
fell
on
all
because
this
was
the
one
thing
never
spoken
of
at
least
in
public
then
the
master
who
had
been
silent
all
that
evening
turned
the
talk
to
other
matters
the
master
to
be
sure
gave
this
distinguished
guest
all
liberties
and
they
often
talked
together
as
men
of
the
same
profession
and
the
surgeon
witnessed
all
the
mending
of
the
mill
the
planting
and
the
hoeing
and
the
harvesting
the
preparations
for
the
long
winter
the
chopping
and
the
all
and
he
tested
it
with
his
hands
not
bad
sport
he
would
say
with
so
many
young
men
about
to
help
but
meanwhile
the
secret
escaped
the
keen
mind
though
he
sought
for
it
daily
you
give
no
drugs
doctor
he
complained
you
a
scab
on
the
profession
the
drugs
gave
out
the
master
explained
and
i
neglected
to
order
more
there
always
bert
williams
at
stowe
who
can
give
you
anything
you
might
want
shall
i
send
for
him
doctor
there
was
laughter
all
about
and
when
it
died
down
the
great
surgeon
returned
to
the
attack
well
come
tell
us
now
what
you
do
believe
in
magic
the
laying
on
of
hands
come
there
are
four
doctors
here
and
we
have
the
right
to
know
or
we
report
you
i
believe
said
the
master
solemnly
in
reply
to
the
banter
i
believe
in
man
and
in
god
and
there
followed
such
talk
as
had
never
been
in
the
old
hall
for
the
surgeon
was
after
his
kind
a
materialist
and
pushed
the
master
for
definition
the
master
believed
as
i
recall
it
that
disease
could
not
be
cured
for
the
most
part
no
chemistry
would
ever
solve
the
mystery
of
pain
but
disease
could
be
ignored
and
the
best
way
to
forget
pain
was
through
labor
not
labor
merely
for
oneself
but
also
something
for
others
wherefore
the
school
around
which
the
inn
and
the
farm
and
all
had
grown
for
he
told
us
then
that
he
had
bought
the
inn
as
a
home
for
his
boys
the
waste
product
of
the
city
finding
the
old
tavern
too
small
for
his
purpose
and
seeing
how
he
should
need
helpers
he
had
encouraged
ailing
men
to
come
to
live
with
him
and
to
cure
themselves
by
curing
others
without
that
school
below
in
the
valley
with
its
workshops
and
cottages
there
would
have
been
no
inn
as
for
god
that
night
he
would
go
no
further
and
the
surgeon
said
rather
flippantly
we
all
thought
that
the
master
had
left
little
room
in
his
world
for
god
anyhow
he
had
made
man
so
large
it
was
a
stormy
august
evening
i
remember
when
we
had
been
forced
to
dine
within
on
account
of
the
gusty
rain
that
had
come
after
a
still
hot
day
the
valley
seemed
filled
with
murk
which
was
momentarily
torn
by
fire
revealing
the
trembling
leaves
upon
the
trees
when
we
passed
through
the
arcade
to
reach
our
rooms
the
surgeon
pointed
out
into
this
sea
of
fire
and
darkness
and
muttered
with
a
touch
of
irony
he
seems
to
be
talking
for
himself
this
evening
just
then
a
bolt
shot
downward
revealing
with
large
exaggeration
the
hills
the
folded
valleys
the
descents
it
like
standing
on
a
thin
plank
in
a
turbulent
sea
the
surgeon
remarked
wryly
ah
my
boy
life
like
that
and
he
disappeared
into
his
room
nevertheless
it
was
that
night
he
wrote
to
his
friend
i
am
getting
nearer
this
mystery
which
i
take
to
be
the
inner
heart
of
it
a
mixture
of
the
holy
ghost
and
sweat
with
a
good
bath
afterward
but
the
old
boy
is
the
mixer
of
the
pills
mind
you
and
he
a
master
most
likely
i
shall
never
get
hold
of
the
heart
of
it
for
somehow
yet
with
all
courtesy
he
keeps
me
at
a
distance
i
have
never
been
whatever
that
may
be
an
experience
that
comes
to
the
youngest
boy
among
them
perhaps
the
doctor
thinks
that
old
fellows
like
you
and
me
have
only
dead
sins
to
confess
which
would
crumble
to
dust
if
exposed
but
there
is
a
sting
in
very
old
sins
i
think
for
instance
oh
if
you
were
here
tonight
i
should
be
as
foolish
as
a
woman
the
storm
that
night
struck
one
of
the
school
buildings
and
killed
a
lad
in
the
morning
the
master
and
the
surgeon
set
out
for
the
school
village
which
was
lower
in
the
valley
beyond
albany
it
was
warm
and
clear
at
the
inn
but
thick
mist
wreaths
still
lay
heavily
over
the
intervale
the
hills
all
about
glittered
as
in
october
and
there
was
in
the
air
that
laughing
peace
that
breath
of
sweet
plenty
which
comes
the
morning
after
a
storm
the
two
men
followed
the
which
wound
downward
from
the
inn
across
the
intervale
the
sun
filled
the
windless
air
sucking
up
the
spicy
odors
of
the
tangled
path
fern
and
balsam
and
the
mother
scent
of
earth
and
rain
and
sun
the
new
green
rioted
over
the
dead
leaves
the
master
closely
observing
his
guest
remarked
you
seem
quite
well
doctor
i
suppose
you
will
be
leaving
us
soon
leaving
the
surgeon
questioned
slowly
as
if
a
secret
dread
had
risen
at
the
master
hint
of
departure
yes
he
admitted
after
a
time
i
suppose
i
am
what
you
would
call
well
well
enough
but
something
still
clogs
within
me
it
may
be
the
memory
of
fear
i
am
afraid
of
myself
afraid
you
need
some
test
perhaps
that
will
come
sooner
or
later
we
need
not
hurry
it
no
we
need
not
hurry
yet
he
knew
well
enough
that
the
inn
never
sheltered
drones
and
that
many
special
indulgences
had
been
granted
him
he
had
borrowed
freely
from
the
younger
brothers
of
their
time
and
strength
he
thought
complacently
of
the
large
cheque
which
he
should
drop
into
the
on
his
departure
with
it
the
master
would
be
able
to
build
a
new
cottage
or
a
small
hospital
for
the
school
some
of
them
mused
the
master
never
go
back
to
the
machine
that
once
broke
them
they
stay
about
here
and
help
me
buy
a
farm
and
revert
but
for
the
most
part
they
are
keen
to
get
back
to
the
fight
as
is
right
and
best
sometimes
when
they
loiter
too
long
i
shove
them
out
of
the
nest
and
i
am
near
the
shoving
point
his
companion
retorted
quickly
so
i
must
leave
all
your
dear
boys
and
peace
and
fishing
and
suppose
so
suppose
so
doctor
you
saved
my
life
oh
hang
it
that
does
tell
the
story
but
even
can
feel
what
it
is
to
live
at
the
inn
instinctively
he
grasped
his
host
by
the
arm
he
was
an
impulsive
man
but
the
master
arm
did
not
respond
to
the
clasp
indeed
a
slight
shiver
seemed
to
shake
it
so
that
the
surgeon
hand
fell
away
while
the
master
said
i
am
glad
to
have
been
of
service
to
you
yes
especially
to
they
came
into
the
school
village
a
tiny
place
of
old
white
houses
very
clean
and
trim
with
a
number
of
sweeping
elms
along
the
narrow
road
a
mountain
brook
turned
an
old
supplying
power
for
the
workshops
where
the
boys
were
trained
the
great
surgeon
had
visited
the
place
many
times
in
company
with
the
master
and
though
he
admired
the
order
and
economy
of
the
institution
and
respected
its
purpose
that
is
to
create
men
out
of
the
refuse
of
society
to
tell
the
truth
the
place
bored
him
a
trifle
this
morning
they
went
directly
to
the
little
cottage
that
served
as
infirmary
where
the
dead
boy
had
been
brought
he
was
a
italian
and
his
lips
curved
upward
pleasantly
the
master
putting
his
hand
on
the
dead
boy
brow
as
he
might
have
done
in
life
stood
looking
at
the
face
i
got
a
case
in
the
next
room
i
like
to
have
your
opinion
on
doctor
the
young
physician
said
in
a
low
tone
to
the
surgeon
and
the
two
crossed
the
passage
into
the
neighboring
room
the
surgeon
fastened
his
eyes
on
the
sick
lad
body
here
was
a
case
he
understood
a
problem
with
a
solution
the
old
master
coming
in
from
the
dead
stood
behind
the
two
williams
the
surgeon
said
it
so
sure
enough
you
must
operate
at
once
i
was
afraid
it
was
that
the
younger
man
replied
but
how
can
i
operate
here
the
surgeon
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
would
never
reach
the
city
then
i
must
you
think
the
shrewd
surgeon
recognized
fear
in
the
young
man
voice
quick
the
thrill
shot
through
his
nerves
and
he
cried
i
will
operate
in
half
an
hour
it
was
over
and
the
master
and
the
surgeon
were
leaving
the
village
climbing
up
by
the
steep
path
under
the
blazing
noon
sun
the
master
glanced
at
the
man
by
his
side
who
strode
along
confidently
a
trifle
of
a
swagger
in
his
buoyant
steps
the
master
remarked
the
test
came
and
you
took
it
splendidly
yes
the
great
surgeon
replied
smiling
happily
it
all
there
doctor
the
old
power
i
believe
i
am
about
ready
to
get
into
harness
again
after
they
had
walked
more
of
the
way
without
speaking
the
surgeon
added
as
to
himself
but
there
are
other
things
to
be
feared
though
the
master
looked
at
him
closely
he
invited
no
explanation
and
they
finished
their
homeward
walk
without
remark
it
soon
got
about
among
the
inmates
of
the
inn
what
a
wonderful
operation
the
surgeon
of
jerome
had
performed
and
it
was
rumored
that
at
the
beginning
of
autumn
he
would
go
back
to
his
old
position
meantime
the
great
surgeon
enjoyed
the
homage
that
men
always
pay
to
power
the
consideration
of
his
fellows
he
had
been
much
liked
but
now
that
the
brothers
knew
how
soon
he
was
to
leave
them
they
surrounded
him
with
those
attentions
that
men
most
love
elevating
him
almost
to
the
rank
of
the
master
and
they
feared
him
less
his
fame
spread
so
that
from
some
mill
beyond
stowe
they
brought
to
the
inn
a
desperate
case
and
the
surgeon
operated
again
successfully
demonstrating
that
he
was
once
more
master
of
his
art
and
master
of
himself
so
he
stayed
on
merely
to
enjoy
his
triumph
and
escape
the
dull
season
in
the
city
it
was
a
wonderful
summer
that
the
fitful
temper
of
the
north
played
in
all
its
moods
there
were
days
when
the
sun
shone
tropically
down
into
the
valleys
without
a
breath
of
air
when
the
earthy
woody
smells
were
strong
and
the
nights
perfect
stillness
and
peace
as
if
some
spirit
of
the
air
were
listening
for
love
words
on
the
earth
the
great
elms
along
albany
road
hung
their
branches
motionless
and
when
the
moon
came
over
behind
the
house
the
great
hills
began
to
swim
ghostly
vague
beyond
always
beyond
and
then
there
were
the
fierce
storms
that
swept
up
the
valley
and
hung
growling
along
the
hills
for
days
and
afterward
and
clear
the
westerly
breeze
would
come
tearing
down
the
intervale
drying
the
earth
before
it
but
each
day
there
was
a
change
in
the
sound
and
the
smell
of
the
fields
and
the
woods
in
the
quick
race
of
the
northern
summer
a
change
that
the
surgeon
fishing
up
the
tiny
streams
felt
and
noted
each
day
so
radiant
with
its
abundant
life
sounded
some
of
fulfilment
and
change
speaking
beforehand
of
death
to
come
toward
the
end
of
august
a
snap
of
cold
drove
us
for
the
night
meal
then
around
the
fire
there
was
great
talk
between
the
master
and
the
surgeon
a
sort
of
battle
of
the
soul
to
which
we
others
paid
silent
attention
for
wherever
those
nights
the
talk
might
rise
in
the
little
rills
of
accidental
words
it
always
flowed
down
to
the
deep
underlying
thoughts
of
men
and
in
those
depths
as
i
said
these
two
wrestled
with
each
other
the
master
who
had
grown
silent
of
late
years
woke
once
more
with
fire
the
light
keen
thrusts
of
the
surgeon
who
argued
like
a
fencer
roused
his
whole
being
and
as
day
by
day
it
went
on
we
who
watched
saw
that
in
a
way
the
talk
of
these
two
men
set
forth
the
great
conflict
of
conflicts
that
deepest
fissure
of
life
and
belief
anent
the
soul
and
the
body
and
the
master
who
had
lived
his
faiths
by
his
life
before
our
eyes
was
being
worsted
in
the
argument
the
great
surgeon
had
the
better
mind
and
he
had
seen
all
of
life
that
one
may
see
with
eyes
they
were
talking
of
the
day
of
departure
for
the
distinguished
guest
and
arranging
for
some
kind
of
triumphal
procession
to
escort
him
to
white
river
but
he
would
not
set
the
time
shrinking
from
this
act
as
if
all
were
not
yet
done
there
came
a
warm
glowing
day
early
in
september
and
at
night
after
the
pipes
were
lighted
the
surgeon
and
the
master
strolled
off
in
the
direction
of
the
pool
arm
in
arm
there
had
been
no
talk
that
day
the
surgeon
apparently
shrinking
from
coming
to
the
last
grapple
with
one
whose
faiths
were
so
important
to
him
as
the
master
the
flowers
are
dying
they
tell
me
it
time
to
move
on
said
the
surgeon
and
yet
my
dear
host
i
go
without
the
secret
without
understanding
all
perhaps
there
is
no
inner
secret
the
master
smiled
it
is
all
here
before
you
i
know
that
you
have
been
very
good
to
me
shared
everything
if
i
have
not
learned
the
secret
it
is
my
fault
my
incapacity
but
and
the
gay
tone
dropped
quickly
and
a
flash
of
bitterness
succeeded
i
at
least
know
that
there
a
secret
they
sat
down
on
the
marble
bench
and
looked
into
the
water
each
thinking
his
thoughts
suddenly
the
surgeon
began
to
speak
hesitantly
as
if
there
had
long
been
something
in
his
mind
that
he
was
compelled
to
say
my
friend
he
said
i
too
have
something
to
tell
the
cause
within
the
cause
the
reason
of
the
reason
at
least
sometimes
i
think
it
is
the
root
reason
for
all
unhappiness
defeat
for
the
shaking
hand
and
the
jesting
voice
and
i
want
you
to
hear
it
if
you
will
the
master
raised
his
face
from
the
pool
but
said
never
a
word
the
surgeon
continued
his
voice
trembling
at
times
though
he
spoke
slowly
evidently
trying
to
banish
all
feeling
it
is
a
common
enough
story
at
the
start
at
least
among
men
of
our
kind
you
know
that
i
was
trained
largely
in
europe
my
father
had
the
means
to
give
me
the
best
and
time
to
take
it
in
so
i
was
over
there
before
i
came
back
to
jerome
three
four
years
at
paris
munich
vienna
all
about
while
i
was
away
i
lived
as
the
others
for
the
most
part
you
know
our
profession
and
youth
the
rascals
are
pretty
much
the
same
i
judge
from
what
my
friends
say
of
their
sons
well
at
least
i
worked
like
the
devil
and
was
decent
oh
it
for
that
i
telling
the
tale
i
was
ambitious
then
and
the
time
came
to
go
back
as
it
does
in
the
end
and
i
took
a
few
weeks
run
through
italy
as
a
final
taste
of
the
lovely
european
thing
and
came
down
to
naples
to
get
the
boat
for
new
york
i
never
been
back
to
naples
since
and
that
was
years
ago
this
autumn
but
i
can
see
the
city
always
as
it
was
then
the
seething
human
hive
the
fellows
piling
in
the
freight
to
the
music
of
their
songs
the
fiery
mouth
of
vesuvius
up
above
and
the
soft
dark
night
with
just
a
plash
of
waves
on
the
quay
the
master
listened
his
eyes
again
buried
in
the
water
at
their
feet
well
was
there
on
board
of
course
looking
out
also
into
that
warm
dark
night
and
sighing
for
all
that
was
to
be
lost
so
soon
there
were
few
passengers
in
those
days
she
was
my
countrywoman
and
beautiful
and
there
was
something
at
least
so
i
thought
then
of
especial
sweetness
in
her
eyes
something
strong
in
her
heart
she
was
engaged
to
a
man
living
somewhere
in
the
states
and
she
was
going
back
to
marry
him
why
she
was
over
there
then
i
forget
and
it
is
of
no
importance
i
think
that
the
man
was
a
doctor
too
in
some
small
city
i
loved
her
the
master
raised
his
eyes
from
the
pool
and
leaning
on
his
folded
arms
looked
into
the
surgeon
face
i
am
afraid
i
never
thought
much
about
that
other
fellow
never
have
to
this
day
that
was
part
of
the
brute
i
am
to
see
only
what
is
before
my
eyes
and
i
knew
by
the
time
we
had
swung
into
the
atlantic
that
i
wanted
that
woman
as
i
had
never
wanted
things
before
she
stirred
me
mind
and
all
of
course
it
might
have
been
some
one
else
any
one
you
will
say
and
if
she
had
been
an
ordinary
young
girl
it
might
have
gone
differently
it
is
one
of
the
things
we
ca
tell
in
this
life
there
was
something
in
that
woman
that
was
big
all
through
and
roused
the
spirit
in
me
i
never
knew
man
or
woman
who
thirsted
more
for
greatness
for
accomplishment
perhaps
the
man
she
was
to
marry
gave
her
little
to
hope
for
probably
it
was
some
raw
affair
such
as
we
have
in
america
the
days
went
by
and
it
was
clearer
to
both
of
us
what
must
be
but
we
did
speak
of
it
she
found
in
me
i
suppose
the
power
the
sort
of
thing
she
had
missed
in
the
other
i
was
to
do
all
those
grand
things
she
was
so
hot
after
i
have
done
some
of
them
too
but
that
was
when
she
had
gone
and
i
no
longer
needed
her
i
needed
her
then
and
i
took
her
that
is
all
the
detail
is
old
and
dim
and
what
do
you
care
to
hear
of
a
young
man
loves
before
we
reached
port
it
was
understood
between
us
i
told
her
i
wanted
her
to
leave
the
other
chap
he
was
never
altogether
clear
to
me
and
to
marry
me
as
soon
as
she
could
we
did
not
stumble
or
slide
into
it
not
in
the
least
we
looked
it
through
and
through
that
was
her
kind
and
mine
how
she
loved
to
look
life
in
the
face
i
have
found
few
women
who
like
that
in
the
end
she
asked
me
not
to
come
near
her
the
last
day
she
would
write
me
the
day
after
we
had
landed
either
yes
or
no
so
she
kissed
me
and
we
parted
still
out
at
sea
all
the
brothers
had
left
the
court
and
the
arcades
where
they
had
been
strolling
and
old
sam
was
putting
out
the
inn
lights
but
the
two
men
beside
the
pool
made
no
movement
the
west
wind
still
drew
in
down
the
valley
with
summer
warmth
and
ruffled
the
water
at
their
feet
my
father
met
me
at
the
dock
you
know
he
was
the
first
surgeon
at
jerome
before
me
my
mother
was
with
him
but
as
she
kissed
me
i
was
thinking
of
that
letter
i
knew
it
would
come
some
things
must
well
it
came
the
silent
listener
bent
his
head
and
the
surgeon
mused
on
his
passionate
memory
at
last
the
master
whispered
in
a
low
voice
that
hardly
reached
into
the
night
did
you
make
her
happy
the
surgeon
did
not
answer
the
question
at
once
did
you
make
her
happy
the
old
man
demanded
again
and
his
voice
trembled
this
time
with
such
intensity
that
his
companion
looked
at
him
wonderingly
and
in
those
dark
eyes
of
the
master
he
read
something
that
made
him
shrink
away
then
for
the
third
time
the
old
man
demanded
sternly
tell
me
did
you
make
her
happy
it
was
the
voice
of
one
who
had
a
right
to
know
and
the
surgeon
whispered
back
slowly
happy
no
my
god
perhaps
at
first
in
the
struggle
a
little
but
afterward
there
was
too
much
too
many
things
it
went
the
inspiration
and
the
love
i
broke
her
heart
she
left
me
that
that
is
reason
it
the
reason
for
you
took
all
all
you
let
her
give
all
and
you
gave
her
what
nothing
she
died
i
know
she
died
the
master
had
risen
and
with
folded
arms
faced
his
guest
a
pitying
look
in
his
eyes
the
surgeon
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
after
a
long
time
said
so
you
knew
this
yes
i
knew
and
knowing
you
let
me
come
here
you
took
me
into
your
house
you
healed
me
you
gave
me
back
my
life
and
the
master
replied
with
a
firm
voice
i
knew
and
i
gave
you
back
your
life
in
a
little
while
he
explained
more
softly
you
and
i
are
no
longer
young
men
who
feel
hotly
and
settle
such
a
matter
with
hate
we
can
not
quarrel
now
for
the
possession
of
a
woman
she
chose
remember
that
it
was
years
this
september
we
have
lived
our
lives
you
and
i
we
have
lived
out
our
lives
the
good
and
the
evil
why
should
we
now
for
the
second
time
add
passion
to
sorrow
and
yet
knowing
all
you
took
me
in
yes
the
old
man
cried
almost
proudly
and
i
have
made
you
again
what
you
once
were
what
loved
as
you
he
added
to
himself
a
man
full
of
power
then
they
were
speechless
in
face
of
the
fact
the
one
had
taken
all
and
the
sweet
love
turned
to
acid
in
his
heart
and
the
other
had
lost
and
the
bitter
turned
to
sweet
when
a
long
time
had
passed
the
surgeon
spoke
timidly
it
might
have
been
so
different
for
her
with
you
you
loved
her
more
there
was
the
light
of
a
compassionate
smile
on
the
master
lips
as
he
replied
yes
i
loved
her
too
and
it
changed
things
for
you
it
changed
things
there
might
have
been
my
jerome
my
fame
also
instead
i
came
here
with
my
boys
and
here
i
shall
die
please
god
the
old
master
then
became
silent
his
face
set
in
a
dream
of
life
as
it
was
as
it
would
have
been
while
the
great
surgeon
of
thought
such
thoughts
as
had
never
passed
before
into
his
mind
the
night
wind
had
died
at
this
late
hour
and
in
its
place
there
was
a
coldness
of
the
turning
season
the
stars
shone
near
the
earth
and
all
was
silent
with
the
peace
of
mysteries
the
master
looked
at
the
man
beside
him
and
said
calmly
it
is
well
as
it
is
all
well
at
last
the
surgeon
rose
and
stood
before
the
master
i
have
learned
the
secret
he
said
and
now
it
is
time
for
me
to
go
he
went
up
to
the
house
through
the
little
court
and
disappeared
within
the
inn
while
the
master
sat
by
the
pool
his
face
graven
like
the
face
of
an
old
man
who
has
seen
the
circle
of
life
and
understands
the
next
morning
there
was
much
talk
about
norton
disappearance
until
some
one
explained
that
the
surgeon
had
been
suddenly
called
back
to
the
city
the
news
spread
through
the
brotherhood
one
winter
that
the
old
inn
had
been
burned
to
the
ground
a
bitter
december
night
when
all
the
were
frozen
and
the
master
who
had
grown
deaf
of
late
had
been
caught
in
his
remote
chamber
and
burned
or
rather
suffocated
there
were
few
men
in
the
inn
at
the
time
it
being
the
holiday
season
and
when
they
had
fought
their
way
to
the
old
man
room
they
found
him
lying
on
the
lounge
by
the
window
the
lids
fallen
over
the
dark
eyes
and
his
face
placid
with
sleep
or
contemplation
they
sought
in
vain
for
the
reason
of
the
fire
but
why
search
for
causes
all
those
beautiful
hills
that
we
loved
to
watch
as
the
evening
haze
gathered
the
master
left
in
trust
for
the
people
of
the
state
many
acres
of
waving
forests
and
the
school
continued
in
its
old
place
the
brothers
looking
after
its
wants
and
supplying
it
with
means
to
continue
its
work
but
the
inn
was
never
rebuilt
the
blackened
ruins
of
buildings
were
removed
and
the
garden
in
the
court
extended
so
that
it
covered
the
whole
space
where
the
inn
had
stood
this
was
enclosed
with
a
thick
plantation
of
firs
on
all
sides
but
that
one
which
looked
westward
across
the
intervale
the
spot
can
be
seen
for
miles
around
on
the
albany
hill
side
and
when
it
was
ready
all
fragrant
and
radiant
with
flowers
they
placed
the
master
there
beside
the
pool
where
he
had
loved
to
sit
surrounded
by
men
on
the
sunken
slab
his
title
