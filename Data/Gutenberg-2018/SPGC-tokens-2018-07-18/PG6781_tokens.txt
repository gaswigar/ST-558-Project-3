the
or
apparitionist
and
sport
of
destiny
from
the
papers
of
count
o
i
am
about
to
relate
an
adventure
which
to
many
will
appear
incredible
but
of
which
i
was
in
great
part
an
the
few
who
are
acquainted
with
a
certain
political
event
will
if
indeed
these
pages
should
happen
to
find
them
alive
receive
a
welcome
solution
thereof
and
even
to
the
rest
of
my
readers
it
will
be
perhaps
important
as
a
contribution
to
the
history
of
the
deception
and
aberrations
of
the
human
intellect
the
boldness
of
the
schemes
which
malice
is
able
to
contemplate
and
to
carry
out
must
excite
astonishment
as
must
also
the
means
of
which
it
can
avail
itself
to
accomplish
its
aims
clear
unvarnished
truth
shall
guide
my
pen
for
when
these
pages
come
before
the
public
i
shall
be
no
more
and
shall
therefore
never
learn
their
fate
on
my
return
to
courland
in
the
year
about
the
time
of
the
carnival
i
visited
the
prince
of
at
venice
we
had
been
acquainted
in
the
service
and
we
here
renewed
an
intimacy
which
by
the
restoration
of
peace
had
been
interrupted
as
i
wished
to
see
the
curiosities
of
this
city
and
as
the
prince
was
waiting
only
for
the
arrival
of
remittances
to
return
to
his
native
country
he
easily
prevailed
on
me
to
tarry
till
his
departure
we
agreed
not
to
separate
during
the
time
of
our
residence
at
venice
and
the
prince
was
kind
enough
to
accommodate
me
at
his
lodgings
at
the
moor
hotel
as
the
prince
wished
to
enjoy
himself
and
his
small
revenues
did
not
permit
him
to
maintain
the
dignity
of
his
rank
he
lived
at
venice
in
the
strictest
incognito
two
noblemen
in
whom
he
had
entire
confidence
and
a
few
faithful
servants
composed
all
his
retinue
he
shunned
expenditure
more
however
from
inclination
than
economy
he
avoided
all
kinds
of
dissipation
and
up
to
the
age
of
years
had
resisted
the
numerous
allurements
of
this
voluptuous
city
to
the
charms
of
the
fair
sex
he
was
wholly
indifferent
a
settled
gravity
and
an
enthusiastic
melancholy
were
the
prominent
features
of
his
character
his
affections
were
tranquil
but
obstinate
to
excess
he
formed
his
attachments
with
caution
and
timidity
but
when
once
formed
they
were
cordial
and
permanent
in
the
midst
of
a
tumultuous
crowd
he
walked
in
solitude
wrapped
in
his
own
visionary
ideas
he
was
often
a
stranger
to
the
world
about
him
and
sensible
of
his
own
deficiency
in
the
knowledge
of
mankind
he
scarcely
ever
ventured
an
opinion
of
his
own
and
was
apt
to
pay
an
unwarrantable
deference
to
the
judgment
of
others
though
far
from
being
weak
no
man
was
more
liable
to
be
governed
but
when
conviction
had
once
entered
his
mind
he
became
firm
and
decisive
equally
courageous
to
combat
an
acknowledged
prejudice
or
to
die
for
a
new
one
as
he
was
the
third
prince
of
his
house
he
had
no
likely
prospect
of
succeeding
to
the
sovereignty
his
ambition
had
never
been
awakened
his
passions
had
taken
another
direction
contented
to
find
himself
independent
of
the
will
of
others
he
never
enforced
his
own
as
a
law
his
utmost
wishes
did
not
soar
beyond
the
peaceful
quietude
of
a
private
life
free
from
care
he
read
much
but
without
discrimination
as
his
education
had
been
neglected
and
as
he
had
early
entered
the
career
of
arms
his
understanding
had
never
been
fully
matured
hence
the
knowledge
he
afterwards
acquired
served
but
to
increase
the
chaos
of
his
ideas
because
it
was
built
on
an
unstable
foundation
he
was
a
protestant
as
all
his
family
had
been
by
birth
but
not
by
investigation
which
he
had
never
attempted
although
at
one
period
of
his
life
he
had
been
an
enthusiast
in
its
cause
he
had
never
so
far
as
came
to
my
knowledge
been
a
freemason
one
evening
we
were
as
usual
walking
by
ourselves
well
masked
in
the
square
of
mark
it
was
growing
late
and
the
crowd
was
dispersing
when
the
prince
observed
a
mask
which
followed
us
everywhere
this
mask
was
an
armenian
and
walked
alone
we
quickened
our
steps
and
endeavored
to
baffle
him
by
repeatedly
altering
our
course
it
was
in
vain
the
mask
was
always
close
behind
us
you
have
had
no
intrigue
here
i
hope
said
the
prince
at
last
the
husbands
of
venice
are
i
do
not
know
a
single
lady
in
the
place
was
my
answer
let
us
sit
down
here
and
speak
german
said
he
i
fancy
we
are
mistaken
for
some
other
we
sat
down
upon
a
stone
bench
and
expected
the
mask
would
have
passed
by
he
came
directly
up
to
us
and
took
his
seat
by
the
side
of
the
prince
the
latter
took
out
his
watch
and
rising
at
the
same
time
addressed
me
thus
in
a
loud
voice
in
french
it
is
past
nine
come
we
forget
that
we
are
waited
for
at
the
this
speech
he
only
invented
in
order
to
deceive
the
mask
as
to
our
route
nine
repeated
the
latter
in
the
same
language
in
a
slow
and
expressive
voice
congratulate
yourself
my
prince
calling
him
by
his
real
name
he
died
at
in
saying
this
he
rose
and
went
away
we
looked
at
each
other
in
amazement
who
is
dead
said
the
prince
at
length
after
a
long
silence
let
us
follow
him
replied
i
and
demand
an
we
searched
every
corner
of
the
place
the
mask
was
nowhere
to
be
found
we
returned
to
our
hotel
disappointed
the
prince
spoke
not
a
word
to
me
the
whole
way
he
walked
apart
by
himself
and
appeared
to
be
greatly
agitated
which
he
afterwards
confessed
to
me
was
the
case
having
reached
home
he
began
at
length
to
speak
is
it
not
laughable
said
he
that
a
madman
should
have
the
power
thus
to
disturb
a
man
s
tranquillity
by
two
or
three
words
we
wished
each
other
a
goodnight
and
as
soon
as
i
was
in
my
own
apartment
i
noted
down
in
my
the
day
and
the
hour
when
this
adventure
happened
it
was
on
a
thursday
the
next
evening
the
prince
said
to
me
suppose
we
go
to
the
square
of
mark
and
seek
for
our
mysterious
armenian
i
long
to
see
this
comedy
i
consented
we
walked
in
the
square
till
eleven
the
armenian
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
we
repeated
our
walk
the
four
following
evenings
and
each
time
with
the
same
bad
success
on
the
sixth
evening
as
we
went
out
of
the
hotel
it
occurred
to
me
whether
designedly
or
otherwise
i
can
not
recollect
to
tell
the
servants
where
we
might
be
found
in
case
we
should
be
inquired
for
the
prince
remarked
my
precaution
and
approved
of
it
with
a
smile
we
found
the
square
of
mark
very
much
crowded
scarcely
had
we
advanced
thirty
steps
when
i
perceived
the
armenian
who
was
pressing
rapidly
through
the
crowd
and
seemed
to
be
in
search
of
some
one
we
were
just
approaching
him
when
baron
f
one
of
the
prince
s
retinue
came
up
to
us
quite
breathless
and
delivered
to
the
prince
a
letter
it
is
sealed
with
black
said
he
and
we
supposed
from
this
that
it
might
contain
matters
of
i
was
struck
as
with
a
thunderbolt
the
prince
went
near
a
torch
and
began
to
read
my
cousin
is
dead
exclaimed
he
when
inquired
i
anxiously
interrupting
him
he
looked
again
into
the
letter
last
thursday
night
at
we
had
not
recovered
from
our
surprise
when
the
armenian
stood
before
us
you
are
known
here
my
prince
said
he
hasten
to
your
hotel
you
will
find
there
the
deputies
from
the
senate
do
not
hesitate
to
accept
the
honor
they
intend
to
offer
you
baron
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
your
remittances
are
he
disappeared
among
the
crowd
we
hastened
to
our
hotel
and
found
everything
as
the
armenian
had
told
us
three
noblemen
of
the
republic
were
waiting
to
pay
their
respects
to
the
prince
and
to
escort
him
in
state
to
the
assembly
where
the
first
nobility
of
the
city
were
ready
to
receive
him
he
had
hardly
time
enough
to
give
me
a
hint
to
sit
up
for
him
till
his
return
about
eleven
o
clock
at
night
he
returned
on
entering
the
room
he
appeared
grave
and
thoughtful
having
dismissed
the
servants
he
took
me
by
the
hand
and
said
in
the
words
of
hamlet
count
there
are
more
things
in
heav
n
and
earth
than
are
dreamt
of
in
your
gracious
prince
replied
i
you
seem
to
forget
that
you
are
retiring
to
your
pillow
greatly
enriched
in
the
deceased
was
the
hereditary
prince
do
not
remind
me
of
it
said
the
prince
for
should
i
even
have
acquired
a
crown
i
am
now
too
much
engaged
to
occupy
myself
with
such
a
trifle
if
that
armenian
has
not
merely
guessed
by
chance
how
can
that
be
my
prince
interrupted
i
then
will
i
resign
to
you
all
my
hopes
of
royalty
in
exchange
for
a
monk
s
i
have
mentioned
this
purposely
to
show
how
far
every
ambitious
idea
was
then
distant
from
his
thoughts
the
following
evening
we
went
earlier
than
usual
to
the
square
of
mark
a
sudden
shower
of
rain
obliged
us
to
take
shelter
in
a
where
we
found
a
party
engaged
at
cards
the
prince
took
his
place
behind
the
chair
of
a
spaniard
to
observe
the
game
i
went
into
an
adjacent
chamber
to
read
the
newspapers
a
short
time
afterwards
i
heard
a
noise
in
the
previously
to
the
entrance
of
the
prince
the
spaniard
had
been
constantly
losing
but
since
then
he
had
won
upon
every
card
the
fortune
of
the
game
was
reversed
in
a
striking
manner
and
the
bank
was
in
danger
of
being
challenged
by
the
pointeur
whom
this
lucky
change
of
fortune
had
rendered
more
adventurous
a
venetian
who
kept
the
bank
told
the
prince
in
a
very
rude
manner
that
his
presence
interrupted
the
fortune
of
the
game
and
desired
him
to
quit
the
table
the
latter
looked
coldly
at
him
remained
in
his
place
and
preserved
the
same
countenance
when
the
venetian
repeated
his
insulting
demand
in
french
he
thought
the
prince
understood
neither
french
nor
italian
and
addressing
himself
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
to
the
company
said
pray
gentlemen
tell
me
how
i
must
make
myself
understood
to
this
at
the
same
time
he
rose
and
prepared
to
seize
the
prince
by
the
arm
his
patience
forsook
the
latter
he
grasped
the
venetian
with
a
strong
hand
and
threw
him
violently
on
the
ground
the
company
rose
up
in
confusion
hearing
the
noise
i
hastily
entered
the
room
and
unguardedly
called
the
prince
by
his
name
take
care
said
i
imprudently
we
are
in
the
name
of
the
prince
caused
a
general
silence
which
ended
in
a
whispering
which
appeared
to
me
to
have
a
dangerous
tendency
all
the
italians
present
divided
into
parties
and
kept
aloof
one
after
the
other
left
the
room
so
that
we
soon
found
ourselves
alone
with
the
spaniard
and
a
few
frenchmen
you
are
lost
prince
said
they
if
you
do
not
leave
the
city
immediately
the
venetian
whom
you
have
handled
so
roughly
is
rich
enough
to
hire
a
bravo
it
costs
him
but
fifty
zechins
to
be
revenged
by
your
the
spaniard
offered
for
the
security
of
the
prince
to
go
for
the
guards
and
even
to
accompany
us
home
himself
the
frenchmen
proposed
to
do
the
same
we
were
still
deliberating
what
to
do
when
the
doors
suddenly
opened
and
some
officers
of
the
inquisition
entered
the
room
they
produced
an
order
of
government
which
charged
us
both
to
follow
them
immediately
they
conducted
us
under
a
strong
escort
to
the
canal
where
a
gondola
was
waiting
for
us
in
which
we
were
ordered
to
embark
we
were
blindfolded
before
we
landed
they
led
us
up
a
large
stone
staircase
and
through
a
long
winding
passage
over
vaults
as
i
judged
from
the
echoes
that
resounded
under
our
feet
at
length
we
came
to
another
staircase
and
having
descended
a
flight
of
steps
we
entered
a
hall
where
the
bandage
was
removed
from
our
eyes
we
found
ourselves
in
a
circle
of
venerable
old
men
all
dressed
in
black
the
hall
was
hung
round
with
black
and
dimly
lighted
a
dead
silence
reigned
in
the
assembly
which
inspired
us
with
a
feeling
of
awe
one
of
the
old
men
who
appeared
to
be
the
principal
inquisitor
approached
the
prince
with
a
solemn
countenance
and
said
pointing
to
the
venetian
who
was
led
forward
do
you
recognize
this
man
as
the
same
who
offended
you
at
the
i
do
answered
the
prince
then
addressing
the
prisoner
is
this
the
same
person
whom
you
meant
to
have
assassinated
the
prisoner
replied
in
the
same
instant
the
circle
opened
and
we
saw
with
horror
the
head
of
the
venetian
severed
from
his
body
are
you
content
with
this
satisfaction
said
the
inquisitor
the
prince
had
fainted
in
the
arms
of
his
attendants
go
added
the
inquisitor
turning
to
me
with
a
terrible
voice
go
and
in
future
judge
less
hastily
of
the
administration
of
justice
in
who
the
unknown
friend
was
who
had
thus
saved
us
from
inevitable
death
by
interposing
in
our
behalf
the
active
arm
of
justice
we
could
not
conjecture
filled
with
terror
we
reached
our
hotel
it
was
past
midnight
the
chamberlain
z
was
waiting
anxiously
for
us
at
the
door
how
fortunate
it
was
that
you
sent
us
a
message
said
he
to
the
prince
as
he
lighted
us
up
the
staircase
the
news
which
baron
f
soon
after
brought
us
respecting
you
from
the
square
of
mark
would
otherwise
have
given
us
the
greatest
i
sent
you
a
message
said
the
prince
when
i
know
nothing
of
this
evening
after
eight
you
sent
us
word
that
we
must
not
be
alarmed
if
you
should
come
home
later
than
the
prince
looked
at
me
perhaps
you
have
taken
this
precaution
without
mentioning
it
to
i
knew
nothing
of
it
it
must
be
so
however
replied
the
chamberlain
since
here
is
your
which
you
sent
me
as
a
mark
of
the
prince
put
his
hand
to
his
it
was
empty
and
he
recognized
the
watch
which
the
chamberlain
held
as
his
own
who
brought
it
said
he
in
amazement
an
unknown
mask
in
an
armenian
dress
who
disappeared
we
stood
looking
at
each
other
what
do
you
think
of
this
said
the
prince
at
last
after
a
long
silence
i
have
a
secret
guardian
here
in
the
frightful
transaction
of
this
night
threw
the
prince
into
a
fever
which
confined
him
to
his
room
for
a
week
during
this
time
our
hotel
was
crowded
with
venetians
and
strangers
who
visited
the
prince
from
a
deference
to
his
rank
they
vied
with
each
other
in
offers
of
service
and
it
was
not
a
little
entertaining
to
observe
that
the
last
visitor
seldom
failed
to
hint
some
suspicion
derogatory
to
the
character
of
the
preceding
one
and
nostrums
poured
in
upon
us
from
all
quarters
every
one
endeavored
to
recommend
himself
in
his
own
way
our
adventure
with
the
inquisition
was
no
more
mentioned
the
court
of
wishing
the
prince
to
delay
his
departure
from
venice
for
some
time
orders
were
sent
to
several
bankers
to
pay
him
considerable
sums
of
money
he
was
thus
against
his
will
compelled
to
protract
his
residence
in
italy
and
at
his
request
i
also
resolved
to
postpone
my
departure
for
some
time
longer
as
soon
as
the
prince
had
recovered
strength
enough
to
quit
his
chamber
he
was
advised
by
his
physician
to
take
an
airing
in
a
gondola
upon
the
brenta
for
the
benefit
of
the
air
to
which
as
the
weather
was
serene
he
readily
consented
just
as
the
prince
was
about
to
step
into
the
boat
he
missed
the
key
of
a
little
chest
in
which
some
very
valuable
papers
were
we
immediately
turned
back
to
search
for
it
he
very
distinctly
remembered
that
he
had
locked
the
chest
the
day
before
and
he
had
never
left
the
room
in
the
interval
as
our
endeavors
to
find
it
proved
ineffectual
we
were
obliged
to
relinquish
the
search
in
order
to
avoid
being
too
late
the
prince
whose
soul
was
above
suspicion
gave
up
the
key
as
lost
and
desired
that
it
might
not
be
mentioned
any
more
our
little
voyage
was
exceedingly
delightful
a
picturesque
country
which
at
every
winding
of
the
river
seemed
to
increase
in
richness
and
beauty
the
serenity
of
the
sky
which
formed
a
may
day
in
the
middle
of
february
the
charming
gardens
and
elegant
countryseats
which
adorned
the
banks
of
the
brenta
the
maestic
city
of
venice
behind
us
with
its
lofty
spires
and
a
forest
of
masts
rising
as
it
were
out
of
the
waves
all
this
afforded
us
one
of
the
most
splendid
prospects
in
the
world
we
wholly
abandoned
ourselves
to
the
enchantment
of
nature
s
luxuriant
scenery
our
minds
shared
the
hilarity
of
the
day
even
the
prince
himself
lost
his
wonted
gravity
and
vied
with
us
in
merry
jests
and
diversions
on
landing
about
two
italian
miles
from
the
city
we
heard
the
sound
of
sprightly
music
it
came
from
a
small
village
at
a
little
distance
from
the
brenta
where
there
was
at
that
time
a
fair
the
place
was
crowded
with
company
of
every
description
a
troop
of
young
girls
and
boys
dressed
in
theatrical
habits
welcomed
us
in
a
pantomimical
dance
the
invention
was
novel
animation
and
grace
attended
their
every
movement
before
the
dance
was
quite
concluded
the
principal
actress
who
represented
a
queen
stopped
suddenly
as
if
arrested
by
an
invisible
arm
herself
and
those
around
her
were
motionless
the
music
ceased
the
assembly
was
silent
not
a
breath
was
to
be
heard
and
the
queen
stood
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
in
deep
abstraction
on
a
sudden
she
started
from
her
reverie
with
the
fury
of
one
inspired
and
looked
wildly
around
her
a
king
is
among
us
she
exclaimed
taking
her
crown
from
her
head
and
laying
it
at
the
feet
of
the
prince
every
one
present
cast
their
eyes
upon
him
and
doubted
for
some
time
whether
there
was
any
meaning
in
this
farce
so
much
were
they
deceived
by
the
impressive
seriousness
of
the
actress
this
silence
was
at
length
broken
by
a
general
clapping
of
hands
as
a
mark
of
approbation
i
looked
at
the
prince
i
noticed
that
he
appeared
not
a
little
disconcerted
and
endeavored
to
escape
the
inquisitive
glances
of
the
spectators
he
threw
money
to
the
players
and
hastened
to
extricate
himself
from
the
crowd
we
had
advanced
but
a
few
steps
when
a
venerable
barefooted
friar
pressing
through
the
crowd
placed
himself
in
the
prince
s
path
my
lord
said
he
give
the
holy
virgin
part
of
your
gold
you
will
want
her
he
uttered
these
words
in
a
tone
of
voice
which
startled
us
extremely
and
then
disappeared
in
the
throng
in
the
meantime
our
company
had
increased
an
english
lord
whom
the
prince
had
seen
before
at
nice
some
merchants
of
leghorn
a
german
prebendary
a
french
abbe
with
some
ladies
and
a
russian
officer
attached
themselves
to
our
party
the
physiognomy
of
the
latter
had
something
so
uncommon
as
to
attract
our
particular
attention
never
in
my
life
did
i
see
such
various
features
and
so
little
expression
so
much
attractive
benevolence
and
such
forbidding
coldness
in
the
same
face
each
passion
seemed
by
turns
to
have
exercised
its
ravages
on
it
and
to
have
successively
abandoned
it
nothing
remained
but
the
calm
piercing
look
of
a
person
deeply
skilled
in
the
knowledge
of
mankind
but
it
was
a
look
that
abashed
every
one
on
whom
it
was
directed
this
extraordinary
man
followed
us
at
a
distance
and
seemed
apparently
to
take
but
little
interest
in
what
was
passing
we
came
to
a
booth
where
there
was
a
lottery
the
ladies
bought
shares
we
followed
their
example
and
the
prince
himself
purchased
a
ticket
he
won
a
snuffbox
as
he
opened
it
i
saw
him
turn
pale
and
start
back
it
contained
his
lost
key
how
is
this
said
he
to
me
as
we
were
left
for
a
moment
alone
a
superior
power
attends
me
omniscience
surrounds
me
an
invisible
being
whom
i
can
not
escape
watches
over
my
steps
i
must
seek
for
the
armenian
and
obtain
an
explanation
from
the
sun
was
setting
when
we
arrived
at
the
pleasurehouse
where
a
supper
had
been
prepared
for
us
the
prince
s
name
had
augmented
our
company
to
sixteen
besides
the
persons
there
was
a
virtuoso
from
rome
several
swiss
gentlemen
and
an
adventurer
from
palermo
in
regimentals
who
gave
himself
out
for
a
captain
we
resolved
to
spend
the
evening
where
we
were
and
to
return
home
by
torchlight
the
conversation
at
table
was
lively
the
prince
could
not
forbear
relating
his
adventure
of
the
key
which
excited
general
astonishment
a
warm
dispute
on
the
subject
presently
took
place
most
of
the
company
positively
maintained
that
the
pretended
occult
sciences
were
nothing
better
than
juggling
tricks
the
french
abbe
who
had
drank
rather
too
much
wine
challenged
the
whole
tribe
of
ghosts
the
english
lord
uttered
blasphemies
and
the
musician
made
a
cross
to
exorcise
the
devil
some
few
of
the
company
amongst
whom
was
the
prince
contended
that
opinions
respecting
such
matters
ought
to
be
kept
to
oneself
in
the
meantime
the
russian
officer
discoursed
with
the
ladies
and
did
not
seem
to
pay
attention
to
any
part
of
conversation
in
the
heat
of
the
dispute
no
one
observed
that
the
sicilian
had
left
the
room
in
less
than
half
an
hour
he
returned
wrapped
in
a
cloak
and
placed
himself
behind
the
chair
of
the
frenchman
a
few
moments
ago
said
he
you
had
the
temerity
to
challenge
the
whole
tribe
of
ghosts
would
you
wish
to
make
a
trial
with
one
of
them
i
will
answered
the
abbe
if
you
will
take
upon
yourself
to
introduce
that
i
am
ready
to
do
replied
the
sicilian
turning
to
us
as
soon
as
these
ladies
and
gentlemen
have
left
why
only
then
exclaimed
the
englishman
a
courageous
ghost
will
surely
not
be
afraid
of
a
cheerful
i
would
not
answer
for
the
consequences
said
the
sicilian
for
heaven
s
sake
no
cried
the
ladies
starting
affrighted
from
their
chairs
call
your
ghost
said
the
abbe
in
a
tone
of
defiance
but
warn
him
beforehand
that
there
are
weapons
at
the
same
time
he
asked
one
of
the
company
for
a
sword
if
you
preserve
the
same
intention
in
his
presence
answered
the
sicilian
coolly
you
may
then
act
as
you
he
then
turned
towards
the
prince
your
highness
said
he
asserts
that
your
key
has
been
in
the
hands
of
a
stranger
can
you
conjecture
in
whose
no
have
you
no
suspicion
it
certainly
occurred
to
me
that
should
you
know
the
person
if
you
saw
him
the
sicilian
throwing
back
his
cloak
took
out
a
and
held
it
before
the
prince
is
this
the
man
the
prince
drew
back
with
affright
whom
have
you
seen
i
inquired
the
the
sicilian
concealed
his
under
his
cloak
is
it
the
person
whom
you
thought
of
demanded
the
whole
company
the
a
sudden
change
manifested
itself
on
every
face
no
more
laughter
was
to
be
heard
all
eyes
were
fixed
with
curiosity
on
the
sicilian
monsieur
l
abbe
the
matter
grows
serious
said
the
englishman
i
advise
you
to
think
of
beating
a
the
fellow
is
in
league
with
the
devil
exclaimed
the
frenchman
and
rushed
out
of
the
house
the
ladies
ran
shrieking
from
the
room
the
virtuoso
followed
them
the
german
prebendary
was
snoring
in
a
chair
the
russian
officer
continued
sitting
in
his
place
as
before
perfectly
indifferent
to
what
was
passing
perhaps
your
attention
was
only
to
raise
a
laugh
at
the
expense
of
that
boaster
said
the
prince
after
they
were
gone
or
would
you
indeed
fulfil
your
promise
to
us
it
is
true
replied
the
sicilian
i
was
but
jesting
with
the
abbe
i
took
him
at
his
word
because
i
knew
very
well
that
the
coward
would
not
suffer
me
to
proceed
to
extremities
the
matter
itself
is
however
too
serious
to
serve
merely
as
a
you
grant
then
that
it
is
in
your
power
the
sorcerer
maintained
a
long
silence
and
kept
his
look
fixed
steadily
on
the
prince
as
if
to
examine
him
it
is
answered
he
at
last
the
prince
s
curiosity
was
now
raised
to
the
highest
pitch
a
fondness
for
the
marvellous
had
ever
been
his
prevailing
weakness
his
improved
understanding
and
a
proper
course
of
reading
had
for
some
time
dissipated
every
idea
of
this
kind
but
the
appearance
of
the
armenian
had
revived
them
he
stepped
aside
with
the
sicilian
and
i
heard
them
in
very
earnest
conversation
you
see
in
me
said
the
prince
a
man
who
burns
with
impatience
to
be
convinced
on
this
momentous
subject
i
would
embrace
as
a
benefactor
i
would
cherish
as
my
best
friend
him
who
could
dissipate
my
doubts
and
remove
the
veil
from
my
eyes
would
you
render
me
this
important
service
what
is
your
request
inquired
the
sicilian
hesitating
for
the
present
i
only
beg
some
proof
of
your
art
let
me
see
an
to
what
will
this
lead
after
a
more
intimate
acquaintance
with
me
you
may
be
able
to
judge
whether
i
deserve
further
i
have
the
greatest
esteem
for
your
highness
gracious
prince
a
secret
power
in
your
countenance
of
which
you
yourself
are
as
yet
ignorant
drew
me
at
first
sight
irresistibly
towards
you
you
are
more
powerful
than
you
are
yourself
aware
you
may
command
me
to
the
utmost
extent
of
my
power
but
then
let
me
see
an
but
i
must
first
be
certain
that
you
do
not
require
it
from
mere
curiosity
though
the
invisible
powers
are
in
some
degree
at
my
command
it
is
on
the
sacred
condition
that
i
do
not
abuse
my
my
intentions
are
most
pure
i
want
they
left
their
places
and
removed
to
a
distant
window
where
i
could
no
longer
hear
them
the
english
lord
who
had
likewise
overheard
this
conversation
took
me
aside
your
prince
has
a
noble
mind
i
am
sorry
for
him
i
will
pledge
my
salvation
that
he
has
to
do
with
a
everything
depends
on
the
manner
in
which
the
sorcerer
will
extricate
himself
from
this
listen
to
me
the
poor
devil
is
now
pretending
to
be
scrupulous
he
will
not
show
his
tricks
unless
he
hears
the
sound
of
gold
there
are
nine
of
us
let
us
make
a
collection
that
will
spoil
his
scheme
and
perhaps
open
the
eyes
of
the
i
am
the
englishman
threw
six
guineas
upon
a
plate
and
went
round
gathering
subscriptions
each
of
us
contributed
some
ors
the
russian
officer
was
particularly
pleased
with
our
proposal
he
laid
a
of
one
hundred
zechins
on
the
plate
a
piece
of
extravagance
which
startled
the
englishman
we
brought
the
collection
to
the
prince
be
so
kind
said
the
english
lord
as
to
entreat
this
gentleman
in
our
names
to
let
us
see
a
specimen
of
his
art
and
to
accept
of
this
small
token
of
our
the
prince
added
a
ring
of
value
and
offered
the
whole
to
the
sicilian
he
hesitated
a
few
moments
gentlemen
answered
he
i
am
humbled
by
this
generosity
but
i
yield
to
your
request
your
wishes
shall
be
at
the
same
time
he
rang
the
bell
as
for
this
money
continued
he
to
which
i
have
no
right
myself
permit
me
to
send
it
to
the
next
monastery
to
be
applied
to
pious
uses
i
shall
only
keep
this
ring
as
a
precious
memorial
of
the
worthiest
of
here
the
landlord
entered
and
the
sicilian
handed
him
over
the
money
he
is
a
rascal
notwithstanding
whispered
the
englishman
to
me
he
refuses
the
money
because
at
present
his
designs
are
chiefly
on
the
whom
do
you
wish
to
see
asked
the
sorcerer
the
prince
considered
for
a
moment
we
may
as
well
have
a
great
man
at
once
said
the
englishman
ask
for
pope
ganganelli
it
can
make
no
difference
to
this
the
sicilian
bit
his
lips
i
dare
not
call
one
of
the
lord
s
that
is
a
pity
replied
the
english
lord
perhaps
we
might
have
heard
from
him
what
disorder
he
died
the
marquis
de
lanoy
began
the
prince
was
a
french
brigadier
in
the
late
war
and
my
most
intimate
friend
having
received
a
mortal
wound
in
the
battle
of
hastinbeck
he
was
carried
to
my
tent
where
he
soon
after
died
in
my
arms
in
his
last
agony
he
made
a
sign
for
me
to
approach
prince
said
he
to
me
i
shall
never
again
behold
my
native
land
i
must
therefore
acquaint
you
with
a
secret
known
to
none
but
myself
in
a
convent
on
the
frontiers
of
flanders
lives
a
he
expired
death
cut
short
the
thread
of
his
discourse
i
wish
to
see
my
friend
to
hear
the
you
ask
much
exclaimed
the
englishman
with
an
oath
i
proclaim
you
the
greatest
sorcerer
on
earth
if
you
can
solve
this
problem
continued
he
turning
to
the
sicilian
we
admired
the
wise
choice
of
the
prince
and
unanimously
gave
our
approval
to
the
proposition
in
the
meantime
the
sorcerer
paced
up
and
down
the
room
with
hasty
steps
apparently
struggling
with
himself
this
was
all
that
the
dying
marquis
communicated
to
you
it
is
did
you
make
no
further
inquiries
about
the
matter
in
his
native
country
i
did
but
they
all
proved
had
the
marquis
de
lanoy
led
an
irreproachable
life
i
dare
not
call
up
every
shade
he
died
repenting
the
excesses
of
his
do
you
carry
with
you
any
token
of
his
i
the
prince
had
really
a
with
the
marquis
portrait
enamelled
in
miniature
on
the
lid
which
he
had
placed
upon
the
table
near
his
plate
during
the
time
of
supper
i
do
not
want
to
know
what
it
is
if
you
will
leave
me
you
shall
see
the
he
requested
us
to
wait
in
the
other
pavilion
until
he
should
call
us
at
the
same
time
he
caused
all
the
furniture
to
be
removed
from
the
room
the
windows
to
be
taken
out
and
the
shutters
to
be
bolted
he
ordered
the
innkeeper
with
whom
he
appeared
to
be
intimately
connected
to
bring
a
vessel
with
burning
coals
and
carefully
to
extinguish
every
fire
in
the
house
previous
to
our
leaving
the
room
he
obliged
us
separately
to
pledge
our
honor
that
we
would
maintain
an
everlasting
silence
respecting
everything
we
should
see
and
hear
all
the
doors
of
the
pavilion
we
were
in
were
bolted
behind
us
when
we
left
it
it
was
past
eleven
and
a
dead
silence
reigned
throughout
the
whole
house
as
we
were
retiring
from
the
saloon
the
russian
officer
asked
me
whether
we
had
loaded
pistols
for
what
purpose
asked
i
they
may
possibly
be
of
some
use
replied
he
wait
a
moment
i
will
provide
he
went
away
the
baron
f
and
i
opened
a
window
opposite
the
pavilion
we
had
left
we
fancied
we
heard
two
persons
whispering
to
each
other
and
a
noise
like
that
of
a
ladder
applied
to
one
of
the
windows
this
was
however
a
mere
conjecture
and
i
did
not
dare
affirm
it
as
a
fact
the
russian
officer
came
back
with
a
brace
of
pistols
after
having
been
absent
about
half
an
hour
we
saw
him
load
them
with
powder
and
ball
it
was
almost
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
when
the
sorcerer
came
and
announced
that
all
was
prepared
before
we
entered
the
room
he
desired
us
to
take
off
our
shoes
and
to
appear
in
our
shirts
stockings
and
he
bolted
the
doors
after
us
as
before
we
found
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
large
black
circle
drawn
with
charcoal
the
space
within
which
was
capable
of
containing
us
all
very
easily
the
planks
of
the
chamber
floor
next
to
the
wall
were
taken
up
all
round
the
room
so
that
we
stood
as
it
were
upon
an
island
an
altar
covered
with
black
cloth
was
placed
in
the
centre
upon
a
carpet
of
red
satin
a
chaldee
bible
was
laid
open
together
with
a
skull
and
a
silver
crucifix
was
fastened
upon
the
altar
instead
of
candles
some
spirits
of
wine
were
burning
in
a
silver
vessel
a
thick
smoke
of
frankincense
darkened
the
room
and
almost
extinguished
the
lights
the
sorcerer
was
undressed
like
ourselves
but
barefooted
about
his
bare
neck
he
wore
an
amulet
suspended
by
a
chain
of
human
hair
round
his
middle
was
a
white
apron
marked
with
cabalistic
characters
and
symbolical
figures
amulet
is
a
charm
or
preservative
against
mischief
witchcraft
or
diseases
amulets
were
made
of
stone
metal
simples
animals
and
everything
which
fancy
or
caprice
suggested
and
sometimes
they
consisted
of
words
characters
and
sentences
ranged
in
a
particular
order
and
engraved
upon
wood
and
worn
about
the
neck
or
some
other
part
of
the
body
at
other
times
they
were
neither
written
nor
engraved
but
prepared
with
many
superstitious
ceremonies
great
regard
being
usually
paid
to
the
influence
of
the
stars
the
arabians
have
given
to
this
species
of
amulets
the
name
of
talismans
all
nations
have
been
fond
of
amulets
the
jews
were
extremely
superstitious
in
the
use
of
them
to
drive
away
diseases
and
even
amongst
the
christians
of
the
early
times
amulets
were
made
of
the
wood
of
the
cross
or
ribbons
with
a
text
of
scripture
written
on
them
as
preservatives
against
diseases
he
desired
us
to
join
hands
and
to
observe
profound
silence
above
all
he
ordered
us
not
to
ask
the
apparition
any
question
he
desired
the
englishman
and
myself
whom
he
seemed
to
distrust
the
most
constantly
to
hold
two
naked
swords
crossways
an
inch
above
his
head
as
long
as
the
conjuration
should
last
we
formed
a
round
him
the
russian
officer
placed
himself
close
to
the
english
lord
and
was
the
nearest
to
the
altar
the
sorcerer
stood
upon
the
satin
carpet
with
his
face
turned
to
the
east
he
sprinkled
holy
water
in
the
direction
of
the
four
cardinal
points
of
the
compass
and
bowed
three
times
before
the
bible
the
formula
of
the
conjuration
of
which
we
did
not
understand
a
word
lasted
for
the
space
of
seven
or
eight
minutes
at
the
end
of
which
he
made
a
sign
to
those
who
stood
close
behind
to
seize
him
firmly
by
the
hair
amid
the
most
violent
convulsions
he
called
the
deceased
three
times
by
his
name
and
the
third
time
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
towards
the
crucifix
on
a
sudden
we
all
felt
at
the
same
instant
a
stroke
as
of
a
flash
of
lightning
so
powerful
that
it
obliged
us
to
quit
each
other
s
hands
a
terrible
thunder
shook
the
house
the
locks
jarred
the
doors
creaked
the
cover
of
the
silver
box
fell
down
and
extinguished
the
light
and
on
the
opposite
wall
over
the
appeared
a
human
figure
in
a
bloody
shirt
with
the
paleness
of
death
on
its
countenance
who
calls
me
said
a
hollow
hardly
intelligible
voice
thy
friend
answered
the
sorcerer
who
respects
thy
memory
and
prays
for
thy
he
named
the
prince
the
answers
of
the
apparition
were
always
given
at
very
long
intervals
what
does
he
want
with
me
continued
the
voice
he
wants
to
hear
the
remainder
of
the
confession
which
then
had
begun
to
impart
to
him
in
thy
dying
hour
but
did
not
in
a
convent
on
the
frontiers
of
flanders
lives
a
the
house
again
trembled
a
dreadful
thunder
rolled
a
flash
of
lightning
illuminated
the
room
the
doors
flew
open
and
another
human
figure
bloody
and
pale
as
the
first
but
more
terrible
appeared
on
the
threshold
the
spirit
in
the
box
began
to
burn
again
by
itself
and
the
hall
was
light
as
before
who
is
amongst
us
exclaimed
the
sorcerer
terrified
casting
a
look
of
horror
on
the
assemblage
i
did
not
want
the
figure
advanced
with
noiseless
and
majestic
steps
directly
up
to
the
altar
stood
on
the
satin
carpet
over
against
us
and
touched
the
crucifix
the
first
apparition
was
seen
no
more
who
calls
me
demanded
the
second
apparition
the
sorcerer
began
to
tremble
terror
and
amazement
kept
us
motionless
for
some
time
i
seized
a
pistol
the
sorcerer
snatched
it
out
of
my
hand
and
fired
it
at
the
apparition
the
ball
rolled
slowly
upon
the
altar
and
the
figure
emerged
unaltered
from
the
smoke
the
sorcerer
fell
senseless
on
the
ground
what
is
this
exclaimed
the
englishman
in
astonishment
aiming
a
blow
at
the
ghost
with
a
sword
the
figure
touched
his
arm
and
the
weapon
fell
to
the
ground
the
perspiration
stood
on
my
brow
with
horror
baron
afterwards
confessed
to
me
that
he
had
prayed
silently
during
all
this
time
the
prince
stood
fearless
and
tranquil
his
eyes
riveted
on
the
second
apparition
yes
i
know
thee
said
he
at
length
with
emotion
thou
art
lanoy
thou
art
my
friend
whence
comest
thou
eternity
is
mute
ask
me
concerning
my
past
who
is
it
that
lives
in
the
convent
which
thou
mentionedst
to
me
in
thy
last
moments
my
how
hast
thou
been
a
father
woe
is
me
that
i
was
art
thou
not
happy
lanoy
god
has
can
i
render
thee
any
further
service
in
this
world
none
but
to
think
of
how
must
i
do
that
thou
wilt
learn
at
the
thunder
again
rolled
a
black
cloud
of
smoke
filled
the
room
when
it
had
dispersed
the
figure
was
no
longer
visible
i
forced
open
one
of
the
window
shutters
it
was
daylight
the
sorcerer
now
recovered
from
his
swoon
where
are
we
asked
he
seeing
the
daylight
the
russian
officer
stood
close
beside
him
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
juggler
said
he
to
him
with
a
terrible
countenance
thou
shalt
summon
no
more
the
sicilian
turned
round
looked
steadfastly
in
his
face
uttered
a
loud
shriek
and
threw
himself
at
his
feet
we
looked
all
at
once
at
the
pretended
russian
the
prince
instantly
recognized
the
features
of
the
armenian
and
the
words
he
was
about
to
utter
expired
on
his
tongue
we
were
all
as
it
were
petrified
with
fear
and
amazement
silent
and
motionless
our
eyes
were
fixed
on
this
mysterious
being
who
beheld
us
with
a
calm
but
penetrating
look
of
grandeur
and
superiority
a
minute
elapsed
in
this
awful
silence
another
succeeded
not
a
breath
was
to
be
heard
a
violent
battering
against
the
door
roused
us
at
last
from
this
stupor
the
door
fell
in
pieces
into
the
room
and
several
officers
of
justice
with
a
guard
rushed
in
here
they
are
all
together
said
the
leader
to
his
followers
then
addressing
himself
to
us
in
the
name
of
the
government
continued
he
i
arrest
we
had
no
time
to
recollect
ourselves
in
a
few
moments
we
were
surrounded
the
russian
officer
whom
i
shall
again
call
the
armenian
took
the
chief
officer
aside
and
as
far
as
i
in
my
confusion
could
notice
i
observed
him
whisper
a
few
words
to
the
latter
and
show
him
a
written
paper
the
officer
bowing
respectfully
immediately
quitted
him
turned
to
us
and
taking
off
his
hat
said
gentlemen
i
humbly
beg
your
pardon
for
having
confounded
you
with
this
impostor
i
shall
not
inquire
who
you
are
as
this
gentleman
assures
me
you
are
men
of
at
the
same
time
he
gave
his
companions
a
sign
to
leave
us
at
liberty
he
ordered
the
sicilian
to
be
bound
and
strictly
guarded
the
fellow
is
ripe
for
punishment
added
he
we
have
been
searching
for
him
these
seven
the
wretched
sorcerer
was
really
an
object
of
pity
the
terror
caused
by
the
second
apparition
and
by
this
unexpected
arrest
had
together
overpowered
his
senses
helpless
as
a
child
he
suffered
himself
to
be
bound
without
resistance
his
eyes
were
wide
open
and
immovable
his
face
was
pale
as
death
his
lips
quivered
convulsively
but
he
was
unable
to
utter
a
sound
every
moment
we
expected
he
would
fall
into
a
fit
the
prince
was
moved
by
the
situation
in
which
he
saw
him
he
undertook
to
procure
his
discharge
from
the
leader
of
the
police
to
whom
he
discovered
his
rank
do
you
know
gracious
prince
said
the
officer
for
whom
your
highness
is
so
generously
interceding
the
juggling
tricks
by
which
he
endeavored
to
deceive
you
are
the
least
of
his
crimes
we
have
secured
his
accomplices
they
depose
terrible
facts
against
him
he
may
think
himself
fortunate
if
he
is
only
punished
with
the
in
the
meantime
we
saw
the
innkeeper
and
his
family
led
bound
through
the
yard
this
man
too
said
the
prince
and
what
is
his
crime
he
was
his
comrade
and
accomplice
answered
the
officer
he
assisted
him
in
his
deceptions
and
robberies
and
shared
the
booty
with
him
your
highness
shall
be
convinced
of
it
presently
search
the
house
continued
he
turning
to
his
followers
and
bring
me
immediate
notice
of
what
you
the
prince
looked
around
for
the
armenian
but
he
had
disappeared
in
the
confusion
occasioned
by
the
arrival
of
the
watch
he
had
found
means
to
steal
away
unperceived
the
prince
was
inconsolable
he
declared
he
would
send
all
his
servants
and
would
himself
go
in
search
of
this
mysterious
man
and
he
wished
me
to
go
with
him
i
hastened
to
the
window
the
house
was
surrounded
by
a
great
number
of
idlers
whom
the
account
of
this
event
had
attracted
to
the
spot
it
was
impossible
to
get
through
the
crowd
i
represented
this
to
the
prince
if
said
i
it
is
the
armenian
s
intention
to
conceal
himself
from
us
he
is
doubtless
better
acquainted
with
the
intricacies
of
the
place
than
we
and
all
our
inquiries
would
prove
fruitless
let
us
rather
remain
here
a
little
longer
gracious
prince
added
i
this
officer
to
whom
if
i
observed
right
he
discovered
himself
may
perhaps
give
us
some
information
respecting
we
now
for
the
first
time
recollected
that
we
were
still
undressed
we
hastened
to
the
other
pavilion
and
put
on
our
clothes
as
quickly
as
possible
when
we
returned
they
had
finished
searching
the
house
on
removing
the
altar
and
some
of
the
boards
of
the
floor
a
spacious
vault
was
discovered
it
was
high
enough
for
a
man
might
sit
upright
in
it
with
ease
and
was
separated
from
the
cellar
by
a
door
and
a
narrow
staircase
in
this
vault
they
found
an
electrical
machine
a
clock
and
a
little
silver
bell
which
as
well
as
the
electrical
machine
was
in
communication
with
the
altar
and
the
crucifix
that
was
fastened
upon
it
a
hole
had
been
made
in
the
opposite
the
chimney
which
opened
and
shut
with
a
slide
in
this
hole
as
we
learnt
afterwards
was
fixed
a
magic
lantern
from
which
the
figure
of
the
ghost
had
been
reflected
on
the
opposite
wall
over
the
chimney
from
the
garret
and
the
cellar
they
brought
several
drums
to
which
large
leaden
bullets
were
fastened
by
strings
these
had
probably
been
used
to
imitate
the
roaring
of
thunder
which
we
had
heard
on
searching
the
sicilian
s
clothes
they
found
in
a
case
different
powders
genuine
mercury
in
vials
and
boxes
phosphorus
in
a
glass
bottle
and
a
ring
which
we
immediately
knew
to
be
magnetic
because
it
adhered
to
a
steel
button
that
by
accident
had
been
placed
near
it
in
his
were
found
a
rosary
a
jew
s
beard
a
dagger
and
a
brace
of
let
us
see
whether
they
are
loaded
said
one
of
the
watch
and
fired
up
the
chimney
jesus
maria
cried
a
hollow
voice
which
we
knew
to
be
that
of
the
first
apparition
and
at
the
same
instant
a
bleeding
person
came
tumbling
down
the
chimney
what
not
yet
laid
poor
ghost
cried
the
englishman
while
we
started
back
in
affright
home
to
thy
grave
thou
hast
appeared
what
thou
wert
not
now
thou
wilt
become
what
thou
didst
but
jesus
maria
i
am
wounded
repeated
the
man
in
the
chimney
the
ball
had
fractured
his
right
leg
care
was
immediately
taken
to
have
the
wound
dressed
but
who
art
thou
said
the
english
lord
and
what
evil
spirit
brought
thee
here
i
am
a
poor
mendicant
friar
answered
the
wounded
man
a
strange
gentleman
gave
me
a
zechin
to
repeat
a
speech
and
why
didst
thou
not
withdraw
as
soon
as
thy
task
was
finished
i
was
waiting
for
a
signal
which
we
had
agreed
on
to
continue
my
speech
but
as
this
signal
was
not
given
i
was
endeavoring
to
get
away
when
i
found
the
ladder
had
been
removed
and
what
was
the
formula
he
taught
thee
the
wounded
man
fainted
away
nothing
more
could
be
got
from
him
in
the
meantime
the
prince
turned
towards
the
principal
officer
of
the
watch
giving
him
at
the
same
time
some
pieces
of
gold
you
have
rescued
us
said
he
from
the
hands
of
an
impostor
and
done
us
justice
without
even
knowing
who
we
were
would
you
increase
our
gratitude
by
telling
us
the
name
of
the
stranger
who
by
speaking
only
a
few
words
was
able
to
procure
us
our
whom
do
you
mean
inquired
the
party
addressed
with
an
air
which
plainly
showed
that
the
question
was
useless
the
gentleman
in
a
russian
uniform
who
took
you
aside
showed
you
a
written
paper
and
whispered
a
few
words
in
consequence
of
which
you
immediately
set
us
do
not
you
know
the
gentleman
was
he
not
one
of
your
company
no
answered
the
prince
and
i
have
very
important
reasons
for
wishing
to
be
more
intimately
acquainted
with
i
know
very
little
of
him
myself
even
his
name
is
unknown
to
me
and
i
saw
him
for
the
first
time
in
my
how
and
was
he
in
so
short
a
time
and
by
using
only
a
few
words
able
to
convince
you
both
of
our
innonocence
and
his
own
undoubtedly
with
a
single
and
this
was
i
confess
i
wish
to
know
this
stranger
my
prince
said
the
officer
weighing
the
zechins
in
his
band
you
have
been
too
generous
for
me
to
make
a
secret
of
it
any
longer
this
stranger
is
an
officer
of
the
of
the
inquisition
this
man
he
is
indeed
gracious
prince
i
was
convinced
of
it
by
the
paper
which
he
showed
to
this
man
did
you
say
that
can
not
i
will
tell
your
highness
more
it
was
upon
his
information
that
i
have
been
sent
here
to
arrest
the
we
looked
at
each
other
in
the
utmost
astonishment
now
we
know
said
the
english
lord
at
length
why
the
poor
devil
of
a
sorcerer
started
in
such
a
terror
when
he
looked
more
closely
into
his
face
he
knew
him
to
be
a
spy
and
that
is
why
he
uttered
that
shriek
and
fell
down
before
no
interrupted
the
prince
this
man
is
whatever
he
wishes
to
be
and
whatever
the
moment
requires
him
to
be
no
mortal
ever
knew
what
he
really
was
did
you
not
see
the
knees
of
the
sicilian
sink
under
him
when
he
said
with
that
terrible
voice
thou
shalt
summon
no
more
ghosts
there
is
something
inexplicable
in
this
matter
no
person
can
persuade
me
that
one
man
should
be
thus
alarmed
at
the
sight
of
the
sorcerer
himself
will
probably
explain
it
the
best
said
the
english
lord
if
that
gentleman
pointing
to
the
officer
will
afford
us
an
opportunity
of
speaking
with
his
the
officer
consented
to
it
and
having
agreed
with
the
englishman
to
visit
the
sicilian
in
the
morning
we
returned
to
venice
the
count
o
whose
narrative
i
have
thus
far
literally
copied
describes
minutely
the
various
effects
of
this
adventure
upon
the
mind
of
the
prince
and
of
his
companions
and
recounts
a
variety
of
tales
of
apparitions
which
this
event
gave
occasion
to
introduce
i
shall
omit
giving
them
to
the
reader
on
the
supposition
that
he
is
as
curious
as
myself
to
know
the
conclusion
of
the
adventure
and
its
effect
on
the
conduct
of
the
prince
i
shall
only
add
that
the
prince
got
no
sleep
the
remainder
of
the
night
and
that
he
waited
with
impatience
for
the
moment
which
was
to
disclose
this
incomprehensible
mystery
note
of
the
german
editor
lord
seymour
this
was
the
name
of
the
englishman
called
upon
us
very
early
in
the
forenoon
and
was
soon
after
followed
by
a
confidential
person
whom
the
officer
had
entrusted
with
the
care
of
conducting
us
to
the
prison
i
forgot
to
mention
that
one
of
the
prince
s
domestics
a
native
of
bremen
who
had
served
him
many
years
with
the
strictest
fidelity
and
had
entirely
gained
his
confidence
had
been
missing
for
several
days
whether
he
had
met
with
any
accident
whether
he
had
been
kidnapped
or
had
voluntarily
absented
himself
was
a
secret
to
every
one
the
last
supposition
was
extremely
improbable
as
his
conduct
had
always
been
quiet
and
regular
and
nobody
had
ever
found
fault
with
him
all
that
his
companions
could
recollect
was
that
he
had
been
for
some
time
very
melancholy
and
that
whenever
he
had
a
moment
s
leisure
he
used
to
visit
a
certain
monastery
in
the
giudecca
where
he
had
formed
an
acquaintance
with
some
monks
this
induced
us
to
suppose
that
he
might
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
priests
and
had
been
persuaded
to
turn
catholic
and
as
the
prince
was
very
tolerant
or
rather
indifferent
about
matters
of
this
kind
and
the
few
inquiries
he
caused
to
be
made
proved
unsuccessful
he
gave
up
the
search
he
however
regretted
the
loss
of
this
man
who
had
constantly
attended
him
in
his
campaigns
had
always
been
faithfully
attached
to
him
and
whom
it
was
therefore
difficult
to
replace
in
a
foreign
country
the
very
same
day
the
prince
s
banker
whom
he
had
commissioned
to
provide
him
with
another
servant
was
announced
at
the
moment
we
were
going
out
he
presented
to
the
prince
a
man
and
of
good
appearance
who
had
been
for
a
long
time
secretary
to
a
procurator
spoke
french
and
a
little
german
and
was
besides
furnished
with
the
best
recommendations
the
prince
was
pleased
with
the
man
s
physiognomy
and
as
he
declared
that
he
would
be
satisfied
with
such
wages
as
his
service
should
be
found
to
merit
the
prince
engaged
him
immediately
we
found
the
sicilian
in
a
private
prison
where
as
the
officer
assured
us
he
had
been
lodged
for
the
present
to
accommodate
the
prince
before
being
removed
to
the
lead
roofs
to
which
there
is
no
access
these
lead
roofs
are
the
most
terrible
prisons
in
venice
they
are
situated
on
the
top
of
the
palace
of
mark
and
the
miserable
criminals
suffer
so
dreadfully
from
the
heat
of
the
leads
occasioned
by
the
heat
of
the
burning
rays
of
the
sun
descending
directly
upon
them
that
they
frequently
become
delirious
the
sicilian
had
recovered
from
his
yesterday
s
terror
and
rose
respectfully
on
seeing
the
prince
enter
he
had
fetters
on
one
hand
and
on
one
leg
but
was
able
to
walk
about
the
room
at
liberty
the
sentinel
at
the
door
withdrew
as
soon
as
we
had
entered
i
come
said
the
prince
to
request
an
explanation
of
you
on
two
subjects
you
owe
me
the
one
and
it
shall
not
be
to
your
disadvantage
if
you
grant
me
the
my
part
is
now
acted
replied
the
sicilian
my
destiny
is
in
your
your
sincerity
alone
can
mitigate
your
punishment
speak
honored
prince
i
am
ready
to
answer
you
i
have
nothing
now
to
you
showed
me
the
face
of
the
armenian
in
a
how
was
this
effected
what
you
saw
was
no
a
portrait
in
crayons
behind
a
glass
representing
a
man
in
an
armenian
dress
deceived
you
my
quickness
the
twilight
and
your
astonishment
favored
the
deception
the
picture
itself
must
have
been
found
among
the
other
things
seized
at
the
but
how
could
you
read
my
thoughts
so
accurately
as
to
hit
upon
the
armenian
this
was
not
difficult
your
highness
you
must
frequently
have
mentioned
your
adventure
with
the
armenian
at
table
in
the
presence
of
your
domestics
one
of
my
accomplices
accidentally
got
acquainted
with
one
of
your
domestics
in
the
giudecca
and
learned
from
him
gradually
as
much
as
i
wished
to
where
is
the
man
asked
the
prince
i
have
missed
him
and
doubtless
you
know
of
his
i
swear
to
your
honor
sir
that
i
know
not
a
syllable
about
it
i
have
never
seen
him
myself
nor
had
any
other
concern
with
him
than
the
one
before
proceed
with
your
story
said
the
prince
by
this
means
also
i
received
the
first
information
of
your
residence
and
of
your
adventures
at
venice
and
i
resolved
immediately
to
profit
by
them
you
see
prince
i
am
sincere
i
was
apprised
of
your
intended
excursion
on
the
brenta
i
prepared
for
it
and
a
key
that
dropped
by
chance
from
your
pocket
afforded
me
the
first
opportunity
of
trying
my
art
upon
how
have
i
been
mistaken
the
adventure
of
the
key
was
then
a
trick
of
yours
and
not
of
the
armenian
you
say
this
key
fell
from
my
pocket
you
accidentally
dropped
it
in
taking
out
your
purse
and
i
seized
an
opportunity
when
no
one
noticed
me
to
cover
it
with
my
foot
the
person
of
whom
you
bought
the
acted
in
concert
with
me
he
caused
you
to
draw
it
from
a
box
where
there
was
no
blank
and
the
key
had
been
in
the
long
before
it
came
into
your
i
understand
you
and
the
monk
who
stopped
me
in
my
way
and
addressed
me
in
a
manner
so
was
the
same
who
as
i
hear
has
been
wounded
in
the
chimney
he
is
one
of
my
accomplices
and
under
that
disguise
has
rendered
me
many
important
but
what
purpose
was
this
intended
to
answer
to
render
you
thoughtful
to
inspire
you
with
such
a
train
of
ideas
as
should
be
favorable
to
the
wonders
i
intended
afterwards
to
show
the
pantomimical
dance
which
ended
in
a
manner
so
extraordinary
was
at
least
none
of
your
contrivance
i
had
taught
the
girl
who
represented
the
queen
her
performance
was
the
result
of
my
instructions
i
supposed
your
highness
would
be
not
a
little
astonished
to
find
yourself
known
in
this
place
and
i
entreat
your
pardon
prince
your
adventure
with
the
armenian
gave
me
reason
to
hope
that
you
were
already
disposed
to
reject
natural
interpretations
and
to
attribute
so
marvellous
an
occurrence
to
supernatural
indeed
exclaimed
the
prince
at
once
angry
and
amazed
and
casting
upon
me
a
significant
look
indeed
i
did
not
expect
neither
did
probably
the
greater
number
of
my
readers
the
circumstance
of
the
crown
deposited
at
the
feet
of
the
prince
in
a
manner
so
solemn
and
unexpected
and
the
former
prediction
of
the
armenian
seem
so
naturally
and
obviously
to
aim
at
the
same
object
that
at
the
first
reading
of
these
memoirs
i
immediately
remembered
the
deceitful
speech
of
the
witches
in
macbeth
hail
to
thee
thane
of
glamis
all
hail
macbeth
that
shall
be
king
hereafter
and
probably
the
same
thing
has
occurred
to
many
of
my
readers
when
a
certain
conviction
has
taken
hold
upon
a
man
s
mind
in
a
solemn
and
extraordinary
manner
it
is
sure
to
follow
that
all
subsequent
ideas
which
are
in
any
way
capable
of
being
associated
with
this
conviction
should
attach
themselves
to
and
in
some
degree
seem
to
be
consequent
upon
it
the
sicilian
who
seems
to
have
had
no
other
motive
for
his
whole
scheme
than
to
astonish
the
prince
by
showing
him
that
his
rank
was
discovered
played
without
being
himself
aware
of
it
the
very
game
which
most
furthered
the
view
of
the
armenian
but
however
much
of
its
interest
this
adventure
will
lose
if
i
take
away
the
higher
motive
which
at
first
seemed
to
influence
these
actions
i
must
by
no
means
infringe
upon
historical
truth
but
must
relate
the
facts
exactly
as
they
note
of
the
german
editor
but
continued
he
after
a
long
silence
how
did
you
produce
the
figure
which
appeared
on
the
wall
over
the
chimney
by
means
of
a
magic
lantern
that
was
fixed
in
the
opposite
in
which
you
have
undoubtedly
observed
an
but
how
did
it
happen
that
not
one
of
us
perceived
the
lantern
asked
lord
seymour
you
remember
my
lord
that
on
your
the
room
it
was
darkened
by
a
thick
smoke
of
frankincense
i
likewise
took
the
precaution
to
place
the
boards
which
had
been
taken
up
from
the
floor
upright
against
the
wall
near
the
window
by
these
means
i
prevented
the
shutter
from
immediately
attracting
observation
moreover
the
lantern
remained
covered
by
a
slide
until
you
had
taken
your
places
and
there
was
no
further
reason
to
apprehend
that
you
would
institute
any
examination
of
the
as
i
looked
out
of
the
window
in
the
other
pavilion
said
i
i
fancied
i
heard
a
noise
like
that
of
a
person
placing
a
ladder
against
the
side
of
the
house
was
i
right
exactly
it
was
the
ladder
upon
which
my
assistants
stood
to
direct
the
the
apparition
continued
the
prince
had
really
a
superficial
likeness
to
my
deceased
friend
and
what
was
particularly
striking
his
hair
which
was
of
a
very
light
color
was
exactly
imitated
was
this
mere
chance
or
how
did
you
come
by
such
a
resemblance
your
highness
must
recollect
that
you
had
at
table
a
by
your
plate
with
an
enamelled
portrait
of
an
officer
in
a
uniform
i
asked
whether
you
had
anything
about
you
as
a
memento
of
your
friend
and
as
your
highness
answered
in
the
affirmative
i
conjectured
that
it
might
be
the
box
i
had
attentively
examined
the
picture
during
supper
and
being
very
expert
in
drawing
and
not
less
happy
in
taking
likenesses
i
had
no
difficulty
in
giving
to
my
shade
the
superficial
resemblance
you
have
perceived
the
more
so
as
the
marquis
features
are
very
but
the
figure
seemed
to
move
it
appeared
so
yet
it
was
not
the
figure
that
moved
but
the
smoke
on
which
the
light
was
and
the
man
who
fell
down
in
the
chimney
spoke
for
the
apparition
he
but
he
could
not
hear
your
question
there
was
no
occasion
for
it
your
highness
will
recollect
that
i
cautioned
you
all
very
strictly
not
to
propose
any
question
to
the
apparition
yourselves
my
inquiries
and
his
answers
were
preconcerted
between
us
and
that
no
mistake
might
happen
i
caused
him
to
speak
at
long
intervals
which
he
counted
by
the
beating
of
a
you
ordered
the
innkeeper
carefully
to
extinguish
every
fire
in
the
house
with
water
this
was
undoubtedly
to
save
the
man
in
the
chimney
from
the
danger
of
being
suffocated
because
the
chimneys
in
the
house
communicate
with
each
other
and
i
did
not
think
myself
very
secure
from
your
how
did
it
happen
asked
lord
seymour
that
your
ghost
appeared
neither
sooner
nor
later
than
you
wished
him
the
ghost
was
in
the
room
for
some
time
before
i
called
him
but
while
the
room
was
lighted
the
shade
was
too
faint
to
be
perceived
when
the
formula
of
the
conjuration
was
finished
i
caused
the
cover
of
the
box
in
which
the
spirit
was
burning
to
drop
down
the
saloon
was
darkened
and
it
was
not
till
then
that
the
figure
on
the
wall
could
be
distinctly
seen
although
it
had
been
reflected
there
a
considerable
time
when
the
ghost
appeared
we
all
felt
an
electric
shock
how
was
that
managed
you
have
discovered
the
machine
under
the
altar
you
have
also
seen
that
i
was
standing
upon
a
silk
carpet
i
directed
you
to
form
a
around
me
and
to
take
each
other
s
hands
when
the
crisis
approached
i
gave
a
sign
to
one
of
you
to
seize
me
by
the
hair
the
silver
crucifix
was
the
conductor
and
you
felt
the
electric
shock
when
i
touched
it
with
my
you
ordered
count
o
and
myself
continued
lord
seymour
to
hold
two
naked
swords
crossways
over
your
head
during
the
whole
time
of
the
conjuration
for
what
purpose
for
no
other
than
to
engage
your
attention
during
the
operation
because
i
distrusted
you
two
the
most
you
remember
that
i
expressly
commanded
you
to
hold
the
sword
one
inch
above
my
head
by
confining
you
exactly
to
this
distance
i
prevented
you
from
looking
where
i
did
not
wish
you
i
had
not
then
perceived
my
principal
i
own
cried
lord
seymour
you
acted
with
due
precaution
but
why
were
we
obliged
to
appear
undressed
merely
to
give
a
greater
solemnity
to
the
scene
and
to
excite
your
imaginations
by
the
strangeness
of
the
the
second
apparition
prevented
your
ghost
from
speaking
said
the
prince
what
should
we
have
learnt
from
him
nearly
the
same
as
what
you
heard
afterwards
it
was
not
without
design
that
i
asked
your
highness
whether
you
had
told
me
everything
that
the
deceased
communicated
to
you
and
whether
you
had
made
any
further
inquiries
on
this
subject
in
his
country
i
thought
this
was
necessary
in
order
to
prevent
the
deposition
of
the
ghost
from
being
contradicted
by
facts
with
which
you
were
previously
acquainted
knowing
likewise
that
every
man
in
his
youth
is
liable
to
error
i
inquired
whether
the
life
of
your
friend
had
been
irreproachable
and
on
your
answer
i
founded
that
of
the
your
explanation
of
this
matter
is
satisfactory
resumed
the
prince
after
a
short
silence
but
there
remains
a
principal
circumstance
which
i
must
ask
you
to
clear
if
it
be
in
my
power
and
no
conditions
justice
in
whose
hands
you
now
are
might
perhaps
not
interrogate
you
with
so
much
delicacy
who
was
this
unknown
at
whose
feet
we
saw
you
fall
what
do
you
know
of
him
how
did
you
get
acquainted
with
him
and
in
what
way
was
he
connected
with
the
appearance
of
the
second
apparition
your
highness
on
looking
at
him
more
attentively
you
gave
a
loud
scream
and
fell
at
his
feet
what
are
we
to
understand
by
that
this
man
your
highness
he
stopped
grew
visibly
perplexed
and
with
an
embarrassed
countenance
looked
around
him
yes
prince
by
all
that
is
sacred
this
unknown
is
a
terrible
what
do
you
know
of
him
what
connection
have
you
with
him
do
not
hope
to
conceal
the
truth
from
i
shall
take
care
not
to
do
so
for
who
will
warrant
that
he
is
not
among
us
at
this
very
moment
where
who
exclaimed
we
altogether
looking
about
the
room
that
is
oh
to
this
man
or
whatever
he
may
be
things
still
more
incomprehensible
are
but
who
is
he
whence
comes
he
is
he
an
armenian
or
a
russian
of
the
characters
be
assumes
which
is
his
real
one
he
is
nothing
of
what
he
appears
to
be
there
are
few
conditions
or
countries
of
which
he
has
not
worn
the
mask
no
person
knows
who
he
is
whence
he
comes
or
whither
he
goes
that
he
has
been
for
a
long
time
in
egypt
as
many
pretend
and
that
he
has
brought
from
thence
out
of
a
catacomb
his
occult
sciences
i
will
neither
affirm
nor
deny
here
we
only
know
him
by
the
name
of
the
incomprehensible
how
old
for
instance
do
you
suppose
he
is
to
judge
from
his
appearance
he
can
scarcely
have
passed
and
of
what
age
do
you
suppose
i
am
not
far
from
quite
right
and
i
must
tell
you
that
i
was
but
a
boy
of
seventeen
when
my
grandfather
spoke
to
me
of
this
marvellous
man
whom
he
had
seen
at
famagusta
at
which
time
he
appeared
nearly
of
the
same
age
as
he
does
at
this
is
exaggerated
ridiculous
and
by
no
means
were
i
not
prevented
by
these
fetters
i
could
produce
vouchers
whose
dignity
and
respectability
should
leave
you
no
room
for
doubt
there
are
several
credible
persons
who
remember
having
seen
him
each
at
the
same
time
in
different
parts
of
the
globe
no
sword
can
wound
no
poison
can
hurt
no
fire
can
burn
him
no
vessel
in
which
he
embarks
can
be
wrecked
time
itself
seems
to
lose
its
power
over
him
years
do
not
affect
his
constitution
nor
age
whiten
his
hair
never
was
he
seen
to
take
any
food
never
did
he
approach
a
woman
no
sleep
closes
his
eyes
of
the
hours
in
the
day
there
is
only
one
which
he
can
not
command
during
which
no
person
ever
saw
him
and
during
which
he
never
was
employed
in
any
terrestrial
and
this
hour
is
the
twelfth
in
the
night
when
the
clock
strikes
twelve
at
midnight
he
ceases
to
belong
to
the
living
in
whatever
place
he
is
he
must
immediately
be
gone
whatever
business
he
is
engaged
in
he
must
instantly
leave
it
the
terrible
sound
of
the
hour
of
midnight
tears
him
from
the
arms
of
friendship
wrests
him
from
the
altar
and
would
drag
him
away
even
in
the
agonies
of
death
whither
he
then
goes
or
what
he
is
then
engaged
in
is
a
secret
to
every
one
no
person
ventures
to
interrogate
still
less
to
follow
him
his
features
at
this
dread
ful
hour
assume
a
sternness
of
expression
so
gloomy
and
terrifying
that
no
person
has
courage
sufficient
to
look
him
in
the
face
or
to
speak
a
word
to
him
however
lively
the
conversation
may
have
been
a
dead
silence
immediately
succeeds
it
and
all
around
wait
for
his
return
in
respectful
silence
without
venturing
to
quit
their
seats
or
to
open
the
door
through
which
he
has
does
nothing
extraordinary
appear
in
his
person
when
he
returns
inquired
one
of
our
party
nothing
except
that
he
seems
pale
and
exhausted
like
a
man
who
has
just
suffered
a
painful
operation
or
received
some
disastrous
intelligence
some
pretend
to
have
seen
drops
of
blood
on
his
linen
but
with
what
degree
of
veracity
i
can
not
did
no
person
ever
attempt
to
conceal
the
approach
of
this
hour
from
him
or
endeavor
to
preoccupy
his
mind
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
him
forget
it
once
only
it
is
said
he
missed
the
appointed
time
the
company
was
numerous
and
remained
together
late
in
the
night
all
the
clocks
and
watches
were
purposely
set
wrong
and
the
warmth
of
conversation
carried
him
away
when
the
stated
hour
arrived
he
suddenly
became
silent
and
motionless
his
limbs
continued
in
the
position
in
which
this
instant
had
arrested
them
his
eyes
were
fixed
his
pulse
ceased
to
beat
all
the
means
employed
to
awake
him
proved
fruitless
and
this
situation
endured
till
the
hour
had
elapsed
he
then
revived
on
a
sudden
without
any
assistance
opened
his
eyes
and
resumed
his
speech
at
the
very
syllable
which
he
was
pronouncing
at
the
moment
of
interruption
the
general
consternation
discovered
to
him
what
had
happened
and
he
declared
with
an
awful
solemnity
that
they
ought
to
think
themselves
happy
in
having
escaped
with
the
fright
alone
the
same
night
he
quitted
forever
the
city
where
this
circumstance
had
occurred
the
common
opinion
is
that
during
this
mysterious
hour
he
converses
with
his
genius
some
even
suppose
him
to
be
one
of
the
departed
who
is
allowed
to
pass
hours
of
the
day
among
the
living
and
that
in
the
his
soul
is
obliged
to
return
to
the
infernal
regions
to
suffer
its
punishment
some
believe
him
to
be
the
famous
apollonius
of
tyana
and
others
the
disciple
of
john
of
whom
it
is
said
he
shall
remain
until
the
last
a
character
so
wonderful
replied
the
prince
can
not
fail
to
give
rise
to
whimsical
conjectures
but
all
this
you
profess
to
know
only
by
hearsay
and
yet
his
behavior
to
you
and
yours
to
him
seemed
to
indicate
a
more
intimate
acquaintance
is
it
not
founded
upon
some
particular
event
in
which
you
have
yourself
been
concerned
conceal
nothing
from
the
sicilian
looked
at
us
doubtingly
and
remained
silent
if
it
concerns
something
continued
the
prince
that
you
do
not
wish
to
be
made
known
i
promise
you
in
the
name
of
these
two
gentlemen
the
most
inviolable
secrecy
but
speak
candidly
and
without
could
i
hope
answered
the
prisoner
after
a
long
silence
that
you
would
not
make
use
of
what
i
am
going
to
relate
as
evidence
against
me
i
would
tell
you
a
remarkable
adventure
of
this
armenian
of
which
i
myself
was
witness
and
which
will
leave
you
no
doubt
of
his
supernatural
powers
but
i
beg
leave
to
conceal
some
of
the
can
not
you
do
it
without
this
condition
no
your
highness
there
is
a
family
concerned
in
it
whom
i
have
reason
to
let
us
hear
your
it
is
about
five
years
ago
began
the
sicilian
that
at
naples
where
i
was
practising
my
art
with
tolerable
success
i
became
acquainted
with
a
person
of
the
name
of
lorenzo
del
m
chevalier
of
the
order
of
stephen
a
young
and
rich
nobleman
of
one
of
the
first
families
in
the
kingdom
who
loaded
me
with
kindnesses
and
seemed
to
have
a
great
esteem
for
my
occult
knowledge
he
told
me
that
the
marquis
del
m
nte
his
father
was
a
zealous
admirer
of
the
cabala
and
would
think
himself
happy
in
having
a
philosopher
like
myself
for
such
he
was
pleased
to
call
me
under
his
roof
the
marquis
lived
in
one
of
his
country
seats
on
the
about
seven
miles
from
naples
there
almost
entirely
secluded
from
the
world
he
bewailed
the
loss
of
a
beloved
son
of
whom
he
had
been
deprived
by
a
terrible
calamity
the
chevalier
gave
me
to
understand
that
he
and
his
family
might
perhaps
have
occasion
to
employ
me
on
a
matter
of
the
most
grave
importance
in
the
hope
of
gaining
through
my
secret
science
some
information
to
procure
which
all
natural
means
had
been
tried
in
vain
he
added
with
a
very
significant
look
that
he
himself
might
perhaps
at
some
future
period
have
reason
to
look
upon
me
as
the
restorer
of
his
tranquillity
and
of
all
his
earthly
happiness
the
affair
was
as
follows
this
lorenzo
was
the
younger
son
of
the
marquis
and
for
that
reason
had
been
destined
for
the
church
the
family
estates
were
to
descend
to
the
eldest
jeronymo
which
was
the
name
of
the
latter
had
spent
many
years
on
his
travels
and
had
returned
to
his
country
about
seven
years
prior
to
the
event
which
i
am
about
to
relate
in
order
to
celebrate
his
marriage
with
the
only
daughter
of
the
neighboring
count
c
tti
this
marriage
had
been
determined
on
by
the
parents
during
the
infancy
of
the
children
in
order
to
unite
the
large
fortunes
of
the
two
houses
but
though
this
agreement
was
made
by
the
two
families
without
consulting
the
hearts
of
the
parties
concerned
the
latter
had
mutually
pledged
their
faith
to
each
other
in
secret
jeronymo
del
m
and
antonia
c
had
been
brought
up
together
and
the
little
restraint
imposed
on
two
children
whom
their
parents
were
already
accustomed
to
regard
as
destined
for
each
other
soon
produced
between
them
a
connection
of
the
tenderest
kind
the
congeniality
of
their
tempers
cemented
this
intimacy
and
in
later
years
it
ripened
insensibly
into
love
an
absence
of
four
years
far
from
cooling
this
passion
had
only
served
to
inflame
it
and
jeronymo
returned
to
the
arms
of
his
intended
bride
as
faithful
and
as
ardent
as
if
they
had
never
been
separated
the
raptures
occasioned
by
his
return
had
not
yet
subsided
and
the
preparations
for
the
happy
day
were
advancing
with
the
utmost
zeal
and
activity
when
the
bridegroom
disappeared
he
used
frequently
to
pass
whole
afternoons
in
a
which
commanded
a
prospect
of
the
sea
and
was
accustomed
to
take
the
diversion
of
sailing
on
the
water
one
day
on
an
evening
spent
in
this
manner
it
was
observed
that
he
remained
absent
a
much
longer
time
than
usual
and
his
friends
began
to
be
very
uneasy
on
his
account
messengers
were
despatched
after
him
vessels
were
sent
to
sea
in
quest
of
him
no
person
had
seen
him
none
of
his
servants
were
missed
he
must
therefore
have
gone
alone
night
came
on
and
he
did
not
appear
the
next
morning
dawned
the
day
passed
the
evening
succeeded
jeronymo
came
not
already
they
had
begun
to
give
themselves
up
to
the
most
melancholy
conjectures
when
the
news
arrived
that
an
algerine
pirate
had
landed
the
preceeding
day
on
that
coast
and
carried
off
several
of
the
inhabitants
two
galleys
which
were
ready
for
sea
were
immediately
manned
the
old
marquis
himself
embarked
in
one
of
them
to
attempt
the
deliverance
of
his
son
at
the
peril
of
his
own
life
on
the
third
morning
they
perceived
the
corsair
they
had
the
advantage
of
the
wind
they
were
just
about
to
overtake
the
pirate
and
had
even
approached
so
near
that
lorenzo
who
was
in
one
of
the
galleys
fancied
that
he
saw
upon
the
deck
of
the
adversary
s
ship
a
signal
made
by
his
brother
when
a
sudden
storm
separated
the
vessels
hardly
could
the
damaged
galleys
sustain
the
fury
of
the
tempest
the
pirate
in
the
meantime
had
disappeared
and
the
distressed
state
of
the
other
vessels
obliged
them
to
land
at
malta
the
affliction
of
the
family
knew
no
bounds
the
distracted
old
marquis
tore
his
gray
hairs
in
the
utmost
violence
of
grief
and
fears
were
entertained
for
the
life
of
the
young
countess
five
years
were
consumed
in
fruitless
inquiries
diligent
search
was
made
along
all
the
coast
of
barbary
immense
sums
were
offered
for
the
ransom
of
the
poor
marquis
but
no
person
came
forward
to
claim
them
the
only
probable
conjecture
which
remained
for
the
family
to
form
was
that
the
same
storm
which
had
separated
the
galleys
from
the
pirate
had
destroyed
the
latter
and
that
the
whole
ship
s
company
had
perished
in
the
waves
but
however
this
supposition
might
be
it
did
not
by
any
means
amount
to
a
certainty
and
could
not
authorize
the
family
altogether
to
renounce
the
hope
that
the
lost
jeronymo
might
again
appear
in
case
however
that
he
was
really
dead
either
the
family
must
become
extinct
or
the
younger
son
must
relinquish
the
church
and
assume
the
rights
of
the
elder
as
justice
on
the
one
hand
seemed
to
oppose
the
latter
measure
so
on
the
other
hand
the
necessity
of
preserving
the
family
from
annihilation
required
that
the
scruple
should
not
be
carried
too
far
in
the
meantime
through
grief
and
the
infirmities
of
age
the
old
marquis
was
fast
sinking
to
his
grave
every
unsuccessful
attempt
diminished
the
hope
of
finding
his
lost
son
he
saw
the
danger
of
his
family
s
becoming
extinct
which
might
be
obviated
by
a
trifling
injustice
on
his
part
in
consenting
to
favor
his
younger
son
at
the
expense
of
the
elder
the
consummation
of
his
alliance
with
the
house
of
count
c
required
only
that
a
name
should
be
changed
for
the
object
of
the
two
families
was
equally
accomplished
whether
antonia
became
the
wife
of
lorenzo
or
of
jeronymo
the
faint
probability
of
the
latter
s
appearing
again
weighed
but
little
against
the
certain
and
pressing
danger
of
the
total
extinction
of
the
family
and
the
old
marquis
who
felt
the
approach
of
death
every
day
more
and
more
ardently
wished
at
least
to
die
free
from
this
inquietude
lorenzo
however
who
was
to
be
principally
benefited
by
this
measure
opposed
it
with
the
greatest
obstinacy
alike
unmoved
by
the
allurements
of
an
immense
fortune
and
the
attractions
of
the
beautiful
and
accomplished
being
whom
his
family
were
about
to
deliver
into
his
arms
he
refused
on
principles
the
most
generous
and
conscientious
to
invade
the
rights
of
a
brother
who
perhaps
was
still
alive
and
might
some
day
return
to
claim
his
own
is
not
the
lot
of
my
dear
jeronymo
said
he
made
sufficiently
miserable
by
the
horrors
of
a
long
captivity
that
i
should
yet
add
bitterness
to
his
cup
of
grief
by
stealing
from
him
all
that
he
holds
most
dear
with
what
conscience
could
i
supplicate
heaven
for
his
return
when
his
wife
is
in
my
arms
with
what
countenance
could
i
hasten
to
meet
him
should
he
at
last
be
restored
to
us
by
some
miracle
and
even
supposing
that
he
is
torn
from
us
forever
how
can
we
better
honor
his
memory
than
by
keeping
constantly
open
the
chasm
which
his
death
has
caused
in
our
circle
can
we
better
show
our
respect
to
him
than
by
sacrificing
our
dearest
hopes
upon
his
tomb
and
keeping
untouched
as
a
sacred
deposit
what
was
peculiarly
his
own
but
all
the
arguments
which
fraternal
delicacy
could
adduce
were
insufficient
to
reconcile
the
old
marquis
to
the
idea
of
being
obliged
to
witness
the
extinction
of
a
pedigree
which
nine
centuries
had
beheld
flourishing
all
that
lorenzo
could
obtain
was
a
respite
of
two
years
before
leading
the
affianced
bride
of
his
brother
to
the
altar
during
this
period
they
continued
their
inquiries
with
the
utmost
diligence
lorenzo
himself
made
several
voyages
and
exposed
his
person
to
many
dangers
no
trouble
no
expense
was
spared
to
recover
the
lost
jeronymo
these
two
years
however
like
those
which
preceded
them
were
in
vain
and
the
countess
antonia
said
the
prince
you
tell
us
nothing
of
her
could
she
so
calmly
submit
to
her
fate
i
can
not
suppose
antonia
answered
the
sicilian
experienced
the
most
violent
struggle
between
duty
and
inclination
between
hate
and
admiration
the
disinterested
generosity
of
a
brother
s
love
affected
her
she
felt
herself
forced
to
esteem
a
person
whom
she
could
never
love
her
heart
was
torn
by
conflicting
sentiments
but
her
repugnance
to
the
chevalier
seemed
to
increase
in
the
same
degree
as
his
claims
upon
her
esteem
augmented
lorenzo
perceived
with
heartfelt
sorrow
the
grief
that
consumed
her
youth
a
tender
compassion
insensibly
assumed
the
place
of
that
indifference
with
which
till
then
he
had
been
accustomed
to
regard
her
but
this
treacherous
sentiment
quickly
deceived
him
and
an
ungovernable
passion
began
by
degrees
to
shake
the
steadiness
of
his
virtue
a
virtue
which
till
then
had
been
unequalled
he
however
still
obeyed
the
dictates
of
generosity
though
at
the
expense
of
his
love
by
his
efforts
alone
was
the
unfortunate
victim
protected
against
the
arbitrary
proceedings
of
the
rest
of
the
family
but
his
endeavors
were
ineffectual
every
victory
he
gained
over
his
passion
rendered
him
more
worthy
of
antonia
and
the
disinterestedness
with
which
he
refused
her
left
her
no
excuse
for
resistance
this
was
the
state
of
affairs
when
the
chevalier
engaged
me
to
visit
him
at
his
father
s
villa
the
earnest
recommendation
of
my
patron
procured
me
a
reception
which
exceeded
my
most
sanguine
hopes
i
must
not
forget
to
mention
that
by
some
remarkable
operations
i
had
previously
rendered
my
name
famous
in
different
lodges
of
freemasons
which
circumstance
may
perhaps
have
contributed
to
strengthen
the
old
marquis
confidence
in
me
and
to
heighten
his
expectations
i
beg
you
will
excuse
me
from
describing
particularly
the
lengths
i
went
with
him
and
the
means
which
i
employed
you
may
judge
of
them
from
what
i
have
already
confessed
to
you
profiting
by
the
mystic
books
which
i
found
in
his
very
extensive
library
i
was
soon
able
to
converse
with
him
in
his
own
language
and
to
adorn
my
system
of
the
invisible
world
with
the
most
extraordinary
inventions
in
a
short
time
i
could
make
him
believe
whatever
i
pleased
and
he
would
have
sworn
as
readily
as
upon
an
article
in
the
canon
moreover
as
he
was
very
devout
and
was
by
nature
somewhat
credulous
my
fables
received
credence
the
more
readily
and
in
a
short
time
i
had
so
completely
surrounded
and
hemmed
him
in
with
mystery
that
he
cared
for
nothing
that
was
not
supernatural
in
short
i
became
the
patron
saint
of
the
house
the
usual
subject
of
my
lectures
was
the
exaltation
of
human
nature
and
the
intercourse
of
men
with
superior
beings
the
infallible
count
gabalis
was
my
oracle
a
mystical
work
of
that
title
written
in
french
in
by
the
abbe
do
villars
and
translated
into
english
in
pope
is
said
to
have
borrowed
from
it
the
machinery
of
his
rape
of
the
g
b
the
young
countess
whose
mind
since
the
loss
of
her
lover
had
been
more
occupied
in
the
world
of
spirits
than
in
that
of
nature
and
who
had
moreover
a
strong
shade
of
melancholy
in
her
composition
caught
my
hints
with
a
fearful
satisfaction
even
the
servants
contrived
to
have
some
business
in
the
room
when
i
was
speaking
and
seizing
now
and
then
one
of
my
expressions
joined
the
fragments
together
in
their
own
way
two
months
were
passed
in
this
manner
at
the
marquis
villa
when
the
chevalier
one
morning
entered
my
apartment
a
deep
sorrow
was
painted
on
his
countenance
his
features
were
convulsed
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
with
gestures
of
despair
captain
said
he
it
is
all
over
with
me
i
must
begone
i
can
remain
here
no
what
is
the
matter
chevalier
what
ails
you
oh
this
fatal
passion
said
he
starting
frantically
from
his
chair
i
have
combated
it
like
a
man
i
can
resist
it
no
and
whose
fault
is
it
but
yours
my
dear
chevalier
are
they
not
all
in
your
favor
your
father
your
my
father
my
relations
what
are
they
to
me
i
want
not
a
forced
union
but
one
of
inclination
have
not
i
a
rival
alas
and
what
a
rival
perhaps
among
the
dead
oh
let
me
go
let
me
go
to
the
end
of
the
world
i
must
find
my
what
after
so
many
unsuccessful
attempts
can
you
still
cherish
hope
hope
replied
the
chevalier
alas
no
it
has
long
since
vanished
from
my
heart
but
it
has
not
from
hers
of
what
consequence
are
my
sentiments
can
i
be
happy
while
there
remains
a
gleam
of
hope
in
antonia
s
heart
two
words
my
friend
would
end
my
torments
but
it
is
in
vain
my
destiny
must
continue
to
be
miserable
till
eternity
shall
break
its
long
silence
and
the
grave
shall
speak
in
my
is
it
then
a
state
of
certainty
that
would
render
you
happy
happy
alas
i
doubt
whether
i
can
ever
again
be
happy
but
uncertainty
is
of
all
others
the
most
dreadful
after
a
short
interval
of
silence
he
suppressed
his
emotion
and
continued
mournfully
if
he
could
but
see
my
torments
surely
a
constancy
which
renders
his
brother
miserable
can
not
add
to
his
happiness
can
it
be
just
that
the
living
should
suffer
so
much
for
the
sake
of
the
dead
who
can
no
longer
enjoy
earthly
felicity
if
he
knew
the
pangs
i
suffer
continued
he
hiding
his
face
on
my
shoulder
while
the
tears
streamed
from
his
eyes
yes
perhaps
he
himself
would
conduct
her
to
my
but
is
there
no
possibility
of
gratifying
your
wishes
he
started
what
do
you
say
my
friend
less
important
occasions
than
the
present
said
i
have
disturbed
the
repose
of
the
dead
for
the
sake
of
the
living
is
not
the
whole
earthly
happiness
of
a
man
of
a
brother
the
whole
earthly
happiness
ah
my
friend
i
feel
what
you
say
is
but
too
true
my
entire
and
the
tranquillity
of
a
distressed
family
are
not
these
sufficient
to
justify
such
a
measure
undoubtedly
if
any
sublunary
concern
can
authorize
us
to
interrupt
the
peace
of
the
blessed
to
make
use
of
a
power
for
god
s
sake
my
friend
said
he
interrupting
me
no
more
of
this
once
i
avow
it
i
had
such
a
thought
i
think
i
mentioned
it
to
you
but
i
have
long
since
rejected
it
as
horrid
and
you
will
have
conjectured
already
continued
the
sicilian
to
what
this
conversation
led
us
i
endeavored
to
overcome
the
scruples
of
the
chevalier
and
at
last
succeeded
we
resolved
to
summon
the
spirit
of
the
deceased
jeronymo
i
only
stipulated
for
the
delay
of
a
fortnight
in
order
as
i
pretended
to
prepare
myself
in
a
suitable
manner
for
so
solemn
an
act
the
time
being
expired
and
my
machinery
in
readiness
i
took
advantage
of
a
very
gloomy
day
when
we
were
all
assembled
as
usual
to
obtain
the
consent
of
the
family
or
rather
gradually
to
lead
them
to
the
subject
so
that
they
themselves
requested
it
of
me
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
task
was
to
obtain
the
approbation
of
antonia
whose
presence
was
most
essential
my
endeavors
were
however
greatly
assisted
by
the
melancholy
turn
of
her
mind
and
perhaps
still
more
so
by
a
faint
hope
that
jeronymo
might
still
be
living
and
therefore
would
not
appear
a
want
of
confidence
in
the
thing
itself
or
a
doubt
of
my
ability
was
the
only
obstacle
which
i
had
not
to
contend
with
having
obtained
the
consent
of
the
family
the
third
day
was
fixed
on
for
the
operation
i
prepared
them
for
the
solemn
transaction
by
mystical
instruction
by
fasting
solitude
and
prayers
which
i
ordered
to
be
continued
till
late
in
the
night
much
use
was
also
made
of
a
certain
musical
instrument
unknown
till
that
time
and
which
in
such
cases
has
often
been
found
very
powerful
the
effect
of
these
artifices
was
so
much
beyond
my
expectation
that
the
enthusiasm
to
which
on
this
occasion
i
was
obliged
to
force
myself
was
infinitely
heightened
by
that
of
my
audience
the
hour
at
last
i
guess
said
the
prince
whom
you
are
now
going
to
introduce
but
go
on
go
no
your
highness
the
incantation
succeeded
according
to
my
how
where
is
the
armenian
do
not
fear
your
highness
he
will
appear
but
too
soon
i
omit
the
description
of
the
farce
itself
as
it
would
lead
me
to
too
great
a
length
be
it
sufficient
to
say
that
it
answered
my
utmost
expectations
the
old
marquis
the
young
countess
her
mother
lorenzo
and
a
few
others
of
the
family
were
present
you
may
imagine
that
during
my
long
residence
in
this
house
i
had
not
wanted
opportunities
of
gathering
information
respecting
everything
that
concerned
the
deceased
several
portraits
of
him
enabled
me
to
give
the
apparition
the
most
striking
likeness
and
as
i
suffered
the
ghost
to
speak
only
by
signs
the
sound
of
his
voice
could
excite
no
suspicion
the
departed
jeronymo
appeared
in
the
dress
of
a
moorish
slave
with
a
deep
wound
in
his
neck
you
observe
that
in
this
respect
i
was
counteracting
the
general
supposition
that
he
had
perished
in
the
waves
for
i
had
reason
to
hope
that
the
unexpectedness
of
this
circumstance
would
heighten
their
belief
in
the
apparition
itself
while
on
the
other
hand
nothing
appeared
to
me
more
dangerous
than
to
keep
too
strictly
to
what
was
i
think
you
judged
rightly
said
the
prince
in
whatever
respects
apparitions
the
most
probable
is
the
least
acceptable
if
their
communications
are
easily
comprehended
we
undervalue
the
channel
by
which
they
are
obtained
nay
we
even
suspect
the
reality
of
the
miracle
if
the
discoveries
which
it
brings
to
light
are
such
as
might
easily
have
been
imagined
why
should
we
disturb
the
repose
of
a
spirit
if
it
is
to
inform
us
of
nothing
more
than
the
ordinary
powers
of
the
intellect
are
capable
of
teaching
us
but
on
the
other
hand
if
the
intelligence
which
we
receive
is
extraordinary
and
unexpected
it
confirms
in
some
degree
the
miracle
by
which
it
is
obtained
for
who
can
doubt
an
operation
to
be
supernatural
when
its
effect
could
not
be
produced
by
natural
means
i
interrupt
you
added
the
prince
proceed
in
your
i
asked
the
ghost
whether
there
was
anything
in
this
world
which
he
still
considered
as
his
own
continued
the
sicilian
and
whether
he
had
left
anything
behind
that
was
particularly
dear
to
him
the
ghost
shook
his
head
three
times
and
lifted
up
his
hand
towards
heaven
previous
to
his
retiring
he
dropped
a
ring
from
his
finger
which
was
found
on
the
floor
after
he
had
disappeared
antonia
took
it
and
looking
at
it
attentively
she
knew
it
to
be
the
ring
she
had
given
her
intended
husband
on
their
the
ring
exclaimed
the
prince
surprised
how
did
you
get
it
who
i
it
was
not
the
true
one
your
highness
i
got
it
it
was
only
a
a
counterfeit
repeated
the
prince
but
in
order
to
counterfeit
you
required
the
true
one
how
did
you
come
by
it
surely
the
deceased
never
went
without
that
is
true
replied
the
sicilian
with
symptoms
of
confusion
but
from
a
description
which
was
given
me
of
the
genuine
ring
a
description
which
was
given
you
by
whom
long
before
that
time
it
was
a
plain
gold
ring
and
had
i
believe
the
name
of
the
young
countess
engraved
on
it
but
you
made
me
lose
the
what
happened
further
said
the
prince
with
a
very
dissatisfied
countenance
the
family
felt
convinced
that
jeronymo
was
no
more
from
that
day
forward
they
publicly
announced
his
death
and
went
into
mourning
the
circumstance
of
the
ring
left
no
doubt
even
in
the
mind
of
antonia
and
added
a
considerable
weight
to
the
addresses
of
the
chevalier
in
the
meantime
the
violent
shock
which
the
young
countess
had
received
from
the
sight
of
the
apparition
brought
on
her
a
disorder
so
dangerous
that
the
hopes
of
lorenzo
were
very
near
being
destroyed
forever
on
her
recovery
she
insisted
upon
taking
the
veil
and
it
was
only
at
the
most
serious
remonstrances
of
her
confessor
in
whom
she
placed
implicit
confidence
that
she
was
induced
to
abandon
her
project
at
length
the
united
solicitations
of
the
family
and
of
the
confessor
forced
from
her
a
reluctant
consent
the
last
day
of
mourning
was
fixed
on
for
the
day
of
marriage
and
the
old
marquis
determined
to
add
to
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
by
making
over
all
his
estates
to
his
lawful
heir
the
day
arrived
and
lorenzo
received
his
trembling
bride
at
the
altar
in
the
evening
a
splendid
banquet
was
prepared
for
the
cheerful
guests
in
a
hall
superbly
illuminated
and
the
most
lively
and
delightful
music
contributed
to
increase
the
general
gladness
the
happy
old
marquis
wished
all
the
world
to
participate
in
his
joy
all
the
entrances
of
the
palace
were
thrown
open
and
every
one
who
sympathized
in
his
happiness
was
joyfully
welcomed
in
the
midst
of
the
throng
the
sicilian
paused
a
trembling
expectation
suspended
our
breath
midst
of
the
throng
continued
the
prisoner
appeared
a
franciscan
monk
to
whom
my
attention
was
directed
by
the
person
who
sat
next
to
me
at
table
he
was
standing
motionless
like
a
marble
pillar
his
shape
was
tall
and
thin
his
face
pale
and
ghastly
his
eyes
were
fixed
with
a
grave
and
mournful
expression
on
the
couple
the
joy
which
beamed
on
the
face
of
every
one
present
appeared
not
on
his
his
countenance
never
once
varied
he
seemed
like
a
statue
among
the
living
such
an
object
appearing
amidst
the
general
joy
struck
me
more
forcibly
from
its
contrast
with
everything
around
it
left
on
my
mind
so
indelible
an
impression
that
from
it
alone
i
have
been
enabled
which
would
otherwise
have
been
impossible
to
recollect
the
features
of
the
franciscan
monk
in
the
russian
officer
for
without
doubt
you
must
have
already
conceived
that
the
person
i
have
described
was
no
other
than
your
armenian
i
frequently
attempted
to
withdraw
my
eyes
from
this
terrible
figure
but
they
wandered
back
involuntarily
and
found
his
countenance
unaltered
i
pointed
him
out
to
the
person
who
sat
nearest
to
me
on
the
other
side
and
he
did
the
same
to
the
person
next
to
him
in
a
few
minutes
a
general
curiosity
and
astonishment
pervaded
the
whole
company
the
conversation
languished
a
general
silence
succeeded
the
monk
did
not
heed
it
he
continued
motionless
as
before
his
grave
and
mournful
looks
constantly
fixed
upon
the
couple
his
appearance
struck
every
one
with
terror
the
young
countess
alone
who
found
the
transcript
of
her
own
sorrow
in
the
fact
of
the
stranger
beheld
with
a
melancholy
satisfaction
the
only
object
that
seemed
to
understand
and
sympathize
in
her
sufferings
the
crowd
insensibly
diminished
it
was
past
midnight
the
music
became
fainter
and
more
languid
the
tapers
grew
dim
and
many
of
them
went
out
the
conversation
declining
by
degrees
lost
itself
at
last
in
secret
murmurs
and
the
faintly
illuminated
hall
was
nearly
deserted
the
monk
in
the
meantime
continued
motionless
with
the
same
grave
and
mournful
look
still
fixed
on
the
couple
the
company
at
length
rose
from
the
table
the
guests
dispersed
the
family
assembled
in
a
separate
group
and
the
monk
though
uninvited
continued
near
them
how
it
happened
that
no
person
spoke
to
him
i
can
not
conceive
the
female
friends
now
surrounded
the
trembling
bride
who
cast
a
supplicating
and
distressed
look
on
the
venerable
stranger
he
did
not
answer
it
the
gentlemen
assembled
in
the
same
manner
around
the
bridegroom
a
solemn
and
anxious
silence
prevailed
among
them
that
we
should
be
so
happy
here
together
began
at
length
the
old
marquis
who
alone
seemed
not
to
behold
the
stranger
or
at
least
seemed
to
behold
him
without
dismay
that
we
should
be
so
happy
here
together
and
my
son
jeronymo
can
not
be
with
us
have
you
invited
him
and
has
he
failed
to
come
asked
the
monk
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
spoken
we
looked
at
him
in
alarm
alas
he
is
gone
to
a
place
from
whence
there
is
no
return
answered
the
old
man
reverend
father
i
you
misunderstood
me
my
son
jeronymo
is
perhaps
he
only
fears
to
appear
in
this
company
replied
the
monk
who
knows
how
your
son
jeronymo
may
be
situated
let
him
now
hear
the
voice
which
he
heard
the
last
desire
your
son
lorenzo
to
call
what
means
he
whispered
the
company
to
one
another
lorenzo
changed
color
i
will
not
deny
that
my
own
hair
began
to
stand
on
end
in
the
meantime
the
monk
approached
a
sideboard
he
took
a
glass
of
wine
and
carried
to
his
lips
to
the
memory
of
our
dear
jeronymo
said
he
let
every
one
who
loved
the
deceased
follow
my
be
you
who
you
may
reverend
father
exclaimed
the
old
marquis
you
have
pronounced
a
name
dear
to
us
all
and
you
are
heartily
welcome
here
then
turning
to
us
he
offered
us
full
glasses
come
my
friends
continued
he
let
us
not
be
surpassed
by
a
stranger
the
memory
of
my
son
jeronymo
never
i
believe
was
any
toast
less
heartily
received
there
is
one
glass
still
unemptied
said
the
marquis
why
does
my
son
lorenzo
refuse
to
drink
this
friendly
toast
lorenzo
trembling
received
the
glass
from
the
hands
of
the
monk
tremblingly
he
put
it
to
his
lips
to
my
brother
jeronymo
he
stammered
out
and
replaced
the
glass
with
a
shudder
that
was
my
murderer
s
voice
exclaimed
a
terrible
figure
which
appeared
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
us
covered
with
blood
and
disfigured
with
horrible
wounds
do
not
ask
me
the
rest
added
the
sicilian
with
every
symptom
of
horror
in
his
countenance
i
lost
my
senses
the
moment
i
looked
at
this
apparition
the
same
happened
to
every
one
present
when
we
recovered
the
monk
and
the
ghost
had
disappeared
lorenzo
was
writhing
in
the
agonies
of
death
he
was
carried
to
bed
in
the
most
dreadful
convulsions
no
person
attended
him
but
his
confessor
and
the
sorrowful
old
marquis
in
whose
presence
he
expired
the
marquis
died
a
few
weeks
after
him
lorenzo
s
secret
is
locked
in
the
bosom
of
the
priest
who
received
his
last
confession
no
person
ever
learnt
what
it
was
soon
after
this
event
a
well
was
cleaned
in
the
farmyard
of
the
marquis
villa
it
had
been
disused
for
many
years
and
was
almost
closed
up
by
shrubs
and
old
trees
on
digging
among
the
rubbish
a
human
skeleton
was
found
the
house
where
this
happened
is
now
no
more
the
family
del
m
is
extinct
and
antonia
s
tomb
may
be
seen
in
a
convent
not
far
from
salerno
you
see
continued
the
sicilian
seeing
us
all
stand
silent
and
thoughtful
you
see
how
my
acquaintance
with
this
russian
officer
armenian
or
franciscan
friar
originated
judge
now
whether
i
had
not
good
cause
to
tremble
at
the
sight
of
a
being
who
has
twice
placed
himself
in
my
way
in
a
manner
so
i
beg
you
will
answer
me
one
question
more
said
the
prince
rising
from
his
seat
have
you
been
always
sincere
in
your
account
of
everything
relating
to
the
chevalier
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
i
have
replied
the
sicilian
you
really
believed
him
to
be
an
honest
man
i
did
by
heaven
i
did
answered
he
again
even
at
the
tine
he
gave
you
the
ring
how
he
gave
me
no
ring
i
did
not
say
that
he
gave
me
the
very
well
said
the
prince
pulling
the
bell
and
preparing
to
depart
and
you
believe
going
back
to
the
prisoner
that
the
ghost
of
the
marquis
de
lanoy
which
the
russian
officer
introduced
after
your
apparition
was
a
true
and
real
ghost
i
can
not
think
let
us
go
said
the
prince
addressing
himself
to
us
the
gaoler
came
in
we
have
done
said
the
prince
to
him
you
sir
turning
to
the
prisoner
you
shall
hear
further
from
i
am
tempted
to
ask
your
highness
the
last
question
you
proposed
to
the
sorcerer
said
i
to
the
prince
when
we
were
alone
do
you
believe
the
second
ghost
to
have
been
a
real
and
true
one
i
believe
it
no
not
now
most
not
now
then
you
did
once
believe
it
i
confess
i
was
tempted
for
a
moment
to
believe
it
something
more
than
the
contrivance
of
a
and
i
could
wish
to
see
the
man
who
under
similar
circumstances
would
not
have
had
the
same
impression
but
what
reasons
have
you
for
retracting
your
opinion
what
the
prisoner
has
related
of
the
armenian
ought
to
increase
rather
than
diminish
your
belief
in
his
super
natural
what
this
wretch
has
related
of
him
said
the
prince
interrupting
me
very
gravely
i
hope
continued
he
you
have
now
no
doubt
but
that
we
have
had
to
do
with
a
no
but
must
his
evidence
on
that
account
the
evidence
of
a
villain
even
supposing
i
had
no
other
reason
for
doubt
can
have
no
weight
against
common
sense
and
established
truth
does
a
man
who
has
already
deceived
me
several
times
and
whose
trade
it
is
to
deceive
does
he
deserve
to
be
heard
in
a
cause
in
which
the
unsupported
testimony
of
even
the
most
sincere
adherent
to
truth
could
not
be
received
ought
we
to
believe
a
man
who
perhaps
never
once
spoke
truth
for
its
own
sake
does
such
a
man
deserve
credit
when
he
appears
as
evidence
against
human
reason
and
the
eternal
laws
of
nature
would
it
not
be
as
absurd
as
to
admit
the
accusation
of
a
person
notoriously
infamous
against
unblemished
and
irreproachable
innocence
but
what
motives
could
he
have
for
giving
so
great
a
character
to
a
man
whom
he
has
so
many
reasons
to
hate
i
am
not
to
conclude
that
he
can
have
no
motives
for
doing
this
because
i
am
unable
to
comprehend
them
do
i
know
who
has
bribed
him
to
deceive
me
i
confess
i
can
not
penetrate
the
whole
contexture
of
his
plan
but
he
has
certainly
done
a
material
injury
to
the
cause
he
advocates
by
proving
himself
to
be
at
least
an
impostor
and
perhaps
something
the
circumstance
of
the
ring
i
allow
appears
somewhat
it
is
more
than
suspicious
answered
the
prince
it
is
decisive
he
received
this
ring
from
the
murderer
and
at
the
moment
he
received
it
he
must
have
been
certain
that
it
was
from
the
murderer
who
but
the
assassin
could
have
taken
from
the
finger
of
the
deceased
a
ring
which
he
undoubtedly
never
took
off
himself
throughout
the
whole
of
his
narration
the
sicilian
has
labored
to
persuade
us
that
while
he
was
endeavoring
to
deceive
lorenzo
lorenzo
was
in
reality
deceiving
him
would
he
have
had
recourse
to
this
subterfuge
if
he
had
not
been
sensible
how
much
he
should
lose
in
our
estimation
by
confessing
himself
an
accomplice
with
the
assassin
the
whole
story
is
visibly
nothing
but
a
series
of
impostures
invented
merely
to
connect
the
few
truths
he
has
thought
proper
to
give
us
ought
i
then
to
hesitate
in
disbelieving
the
eleventh
assertion
of
a
person
who
has
already
deceived
me
ten
times
rather
than
admit
a
violation
of
the
fundamental
laws
of
nature
which
i
have
ever
found
in
the
most
perfect
harmony
i
have
nothing
to
reply
to
all
this
but
the
apparition
we
saw
yesterday
is
to
me
not
the
less
it
is
also
incomprehensible
to
me
although
i
have
been
tempted
to
believe
that
i
have
found
a
key
to
how
so
asked
i
do
not
you
recollect
that
the
second
apparition
as
soon
as
he
entered
walked
directly
up
to
the
altar
took
the
crucifix
in
his
hand
and
placed
himself
upon
the
carpet
it
appeared
so
to
and
this
crucifix
according
to
the
sicilian
s
confession
was
a
conductor
you
see
that
the
apparition
hastened
to
make
himself
electrical
thus
the
blow
which
lord
seymour
struck
him
with
a
sword
was
of
course
ineffectual
the
electric
stroke
disabled
his
this
is
true
with
respect
to
the
sword
but
the
pistol
fired
by
the
sicilian
the
ball
of
which
we
heard
roll
slowly
upon
the
altar
are
you
convinced
that
this
was
the
same
ball
which
was
fired
from
the
pistol
replied
the
prince
not
to
mention
that
the
puppet
or
the
man
who
represented
the
ghost
may
have
been
so
well
accoutred
as
to
be
invulnerable
by
sword
or
bullet
but
consider
who
it
was
that
loaded
the
true
said
i
and
a
sudden
light
broke
upon
my
mind
the
russian
officer
had
loaded
them
but
it
was
in
our
presence
how
could
he
have
deceived
us
why
should
he
not
have
deceived
us
did
you
suspect
him
sufficiently
to
observe
him
did
you
examine
the
ball
before
it
was
put
into
the
pistol
may
it
not
have
been
one
of
quicksilver
or
clay
did
you
take
notice
whether
the
russian
officer
really
put
it
into
the
barrel
or
dropped
it
into
his
other
hand
but
supposing
that
he
actually
loaded
the
pistols
what
is
to
convince
you
that
he
really
took
the
loaded
ones
into
the
room
where
the
ghost
appeared
and
did
not
change
them
for
another
pair
which
he
might
have
done
the
more
easily
as
nobody
ever
thought
of
noticing
him
and
we
were
besides
occupied
in
undressing
and
could
not
the
figure
at
the
moment
when
we
were
prevented
from
seeing
it
by
the
smoke
of
the
pistol
have
dropped
another
ball
with
which
it
had
been
beforehand
provided
on
the
the
altar
which
of
these
conjectures
is
impossible
you
are
right
but
that
striking
resemblance
to
your
deceased
friend
i
have
often
seen
him
with
you
and
i
immediately
recognized
him
in
the
i
did
the
same
and
i
must
confess
the
illusion
was
complete
but
if
the
juggler
from
a
few
stolen
glances
at
my
was
able
to
give
to
his
apparition
a
resemblance
what
was
to
prevent
the
russian
officer
who
had
used
the
box
during
the
whole
time
of
supper
who
had
had
liberty
to
observe
the
picture
unnoticed
and
to
whom
i
had
discovered
in
confidence
whom
it
represented
what
was
to
prevent
him
from
doing
the
same
add
to
this
what
has
been
before
observed
by
the
sicilian
that
the
prominent
features
of
the
marquis
were
so
striking
as
to
be
easily
imitated
what
is
there
so
inexplicable
in
this
second
ghost
but
the
words
he
uttered
the
information
he
gave
you
about
your
friend
what
said
the
prince
did
not
the
sicilian
assure
us
that
from
the
little
which
he
had
learnt
from
me
he
had
composed
a
similar
story
does
not
this
prove
that
the
invention
was
obvious
and
natural
besides
the
answers
of
the
ghost
like
those
of
an
oracle
were
so
obscure
that
he
was
in
no
danger
of
being
detected
in
a
falsehood
if
the
man
who
personated
the
ghost
possessed
sagacity
and
presence
of
mind
and
knew
of
the
affair
on
which
he
was
consulted
to
what
length
might
not
he
have
carried
the
deception
pray
consider
your
highness
how
much
preparation
such
a
complicated
artifice
would
have
required
from
the
armenian
how
much
time
it
takes
to
paint
a
face
with
sufficient
exactness
how
much
time
would
have
been
requisite
to
instruct
the
pretended
ghost
so
as
to
guard
him
against
gross
errors
what
a
degree
of
minute
attention
to
regulate
every
minor
attendant
or
adventitious
circumstance
which
must
be
answered
in
some
manner
lest
they
should
prove
detrimental
and
remember
that
the
russian
officer
was
absent
but
half
an
hour
was
that
short
space
of
time
sufficient
to
make
even
such
arrangements
as
were
most
indispensable
surely
my
prince
not
even
a
dramatic
writer
who
has
the
least
desire
to
preserve
the
three
terrible
unities
of
aristotle
durst
venture
to
load
the
interval
between
one
act
and
another
with
such
a
variety
of
action
or
to
presume
upon
such
a
facility
of
belief
in
his
what
you
think
it
absolutely
impossible
that
every
necessary
preparation
should
have
been
made
in
the
space
of
half
an
hour
indeed
i
look
upon
it
as
almost
i
do
not
understand
this
expression
does
it
militate
against
the
physical
laws
of
time
and
space
or
of
matter
and
motion
that
a
man
so
ingenious
and
so
expert
as
this
armenian
must
undoubtedly
be
assisted
by
agents
whose
dexterity
and
acuteness
are
probably
not
inferior
to
his
own
favored
by
the
time
of
night
and
watched
by
no
one
provided
with
such
means
and
instruments
as
a
man
of
this
profession
is
never
without
is
it
impossible
that
such
a
man
favored
by
such
circumstances
should
be
able
to
effect
so
much
in
so
short
a
time
is
it
ridiculous
or
absurd
to
suppose
that
by
a
very
small
number
of
words
or
signs
he
can
convey
to
his
assistants
very
extensive
commissions
and
direct
very
complex
operations
nothing
ought
to
be
admitted
that
is
contrary
to
the
established
laws
of
nature
unless
it
is
something
with
which
these
laws
are
absolutely
incompatible
would
you
rather
give
credit
to
a
miracle
than
admit
an
improbability
would
you
solve
a
difficulty
rather
by
overturning
the
powers
of
nature
than
by
believing
an
artful
and
uncommon
combination
of
them
though
the
fact
will
not
justify
a
conclusion
such
as
you
have
condemned
you
must
however
grant
that
it
is
far
beyond
our
i
am
almost
tempted
to
dispute
even
this
said
the
prince
with
a
quiet
smile
what
would
you
say
my
dear
count
if
it
should
be
proved
for
instance
that
the
operations
of
the
armenian
were
prepared
and
carried
on
not
only
during
the
that
he
was
absent
from
us
not
only
in
haste
and
incidentally
but
during
the
whole
evening
and
the
whole
night
you
recollect
that
the
sicilian
employed
nearly
three
hours
in
the
sicilian
yes
my
and
how
will
you
convince
me
that
this
juggler
had
not
as
much
concern
in
the
second
apparition
as
in
the
first
how
so
your
highness
that
he
was
not
the
principal
assistant
of
the
armenian
in
a
word
how
will
you
convince
me
that
they
did
not
it
would
be
a
difficult
task
to
prove
that
exclaimed
i
with
no
little
surprise
not
so
difficult
my
dear
count
as
you
imagine
what
could
it
have
happened
by
mere
chance
that
these
two
men
should
form
a
design
so
extraordinary
and
so
complicated
upon
the
same
person
at
the
same
time
and
in
the
same
place
could
mere
chance
have
produced
such
an
exact
harmony
between
their
operations
that
one
of
them
should
play
so
exactly
the
game
of
the
other
suppose
for
a
moment
that
the
armenian
intended
to
heighten
the
effect
of
his
deception
by
introducing
it
after
a
less
refined
one
that
he
created
a
hector
to
make
himself
his
achilles
suppose
that
he
has
done
all
this
to
discover
what
degree
of
credulity
he
could
expect
to
find
in
me
to
examine
the
readiest
way
to
gain
my
confidence
to
familiarize
himself
with
his
subject
by
an
attempt
that
might
have
miscarried
without
any
prejudice
to
his
plan
in
a
word
to
tune
the
instrument
on
which
he
intended
to
play
suppose
he
did
this
with
the
view
of
exciting
my
suspicions
on
one
subject
in
order
to
divert
my
attention
from
another
more
important
to
his
design
lastly
suppose
he
wishes
to
have
some
indirect
methods
of
information
which
he
had
himself
occasion
to
practise
imputed
to
the
sorcerer
in
order
to
divert
suspicion
from
the
true
how
do
you
mean
said
i
suppose
for
instance
that
he
may
have
bribed
some
of
my
servants
to
give
him
secret
intelligence
or
perhaps
even
some
papers
which
may
serve
his
purpose
i
have
missed
one
of
my
domestics
what
reason
have
i
to
think
that
the
armenian
is
not
concerned
in
his
leaving
me
such
a
connection
however
if
it
existed
may
be
accidently
discovered
a
letter
may
be
intercepted
a
servant
who
is
in
the
secret
may
betray
his
trust
now
all
the
consequence
of
the
armenian
is
destroyed
if
i
detect
the
source
of
his
omniscience
he
therefore
introduces
this
sorcerer
who
must
be
supposed
to
have
some
design
upon
me
he
takes
care
to
give
me
early
notice
of
him
and
his
intentions
so
that
whatever
i
may
hereafter
discover
my
suspicions
must
necessarily
rest
upon
the
sicilian
this
is
the
puppet
with
which
he
amuses
me
whilst
he
himself
unobserved
and
unsuspected
is
entangling
me
in
invisible
we
will
allow
this
but
is
it
consistent
with
the
armenian
s
plan
that
he
himself
should
destroy
the
illusion
which
he
has
created
and
disclose
the
mysteries
of
his
science
to
the
eyes
of
the
uninitiated
what
mysteries
does
he
disclose
none
surely
which
he
intends
to
practise
on
me
he
therefore
loses
nothing
by
the
discovery
but
on
the
other
hand
what
an
advantage
will
he
gain
if
this
pretended
victory
over
juggling
and
deception
should
render
me
secure
and
unsuspecting
if
he
succeeds
in
diverting
my
attention
from
the
right
quarter
and
in
fixing
my
wavering
suspicions
on
an
object
the
most
remote
from
the
real
one
he
could
naturally
expect
that
sooner
or
later
either
from
my
own
doubts
or
at
the
suggestion
of
another
i
should
be
tempted
to
seek
a
key
to
his
mysterious
wonders
in
the
mere
art
of
a
juggler
how
could
he
better
provide
against
such
an
inquiry
than
by
contrasting
his
prodigies
with
juggling
tricks
by
confining
the
latter
within
artificial
limits
and
by
delivering
as
it
were
into
my
hands
a
scale
by
which
to
appreciate
them
he
naturally
exalts
and
perplexes
my
ideas
of
the
former
how
many
suspicions
he
precludes
by
this
single
contrivance
how
many
methods
of
accounting
for
his
miracles
which
afterwards
have
occurred
to
me
does
he
refute
beforehand
but
in
exposing
such
a
finished
deception
he
has
acted
very
much
against
his
own
interest
both
by
quickening
the
penetration
of
those
whom
he
meant
to
impose
upon
and
by
staggering
their
belief
in
miracles
in
general
your
highness
self
is
the
best
proof
of
the
insufficiency
of
his
plan
if
indeed
he
ever
had
perhaps
he
has
been
mistaken
in
respect
to
myself
said
the
prince
but
his
conclusions
have
nevertheless
been
well
founded
could
he
foresee
that
i
should
exactly
notice
the
very
circumstance
which
threatens
to
become
the
key
to
the
whole
artifice
was
it
in
his
plan
that
the
creature
he
employed
should
render
himself
thus
vulnerable
are
we
certain
that
the
sicilian
has
not
far
exceeded
his
commission
he
has
undoubtedly
done
so
with
respect
to
the
ring
and
yet
it
is
chiefly
this
single
circumstance
which
determined
my
distrust
in
him
how
easily
may
a
plan
whose
contexture
is
most
artful
and
refined
be
spoiled
in
the
execution
by
an
awkward
instrument
it
certainly
was
not
the
armenian
s
intention
that
the
sorcerer
should
trumpet
his
fame
to
us
in
the
style
of
a
mountebank
that
he
should
endeavor
to
impose
upon
us
such
fables
as
are
too
gross
to
bear
the
least
reflection
for
instance
with
what
countenance
could
this
impostor
affirm
that
the
miraculous
being
he
spoke
of
must
renounce
all
commerce
with
mankind
at
twelve
in
the
night
did
we
not
see
him
among
us
at
that
very
hour
that
is
true
cried
i
he
must
have
forgotten
it
often
happens
to
people
of
this
description
that
they
overact
their
parts
and
by
aiming
at
too
much
mar
the
effects
which
a
deception
is
calculated
to
i
can
not
however
yet
prevail
on
myself
to
look
upon
the
whole
as
a
mere
preconcerted
scheme
what
the
sicilian
s
terror
his
convulsive
fits
his
swoon
the
deplorable
situation
in
which
we
saw
him
and
which
was
even
such
as
to
move
our
pity
were
all
these
nothing
more
than
a
studied
part
i
allow
that
a
skilful
performer
may
carry
imitation
to
a
very
high
pitch
but
he
certainly
has
no
power
over
the
organs
of
as
for
that
my
friend
replied
the
prince
i
have
seen
richard
iii
performed
by
garrick
but
were
we
at
that
moment
sufficiently
cool
to
be
capable
of
observing
dispassionately
could
we
judge
of
the
emotion
of
the
sicilian
when
we
were
almost
overcome
by
our
own
besides
the
decisive
crisis
even
of
a
deception
is
so
momentous
to
the
deceiver
himself
that
excessive
anxiety
may
produce
in
him
symptoms
as
violent
as
those
which
surprise
excites
in
the
deceived
add
to
this
the
unexpected
entrance
of
the
i
am
glad
you
remind
me
of
that
prince
would
the
armenian
have
ventured
to
discover
such
a
dangerous
scheme
to
the
eye
of
justice
to
expose
the
fidelity
of
his
creature
to
so
severe
a
test
and
for
what
purpose
leave
that
matter
to
him
he
is
no
doubt
acquainted
with
the
people
he
employs
do
we
know
what
secret
crimes
may
have
secured
him
the
silence
of
this
man
you
have
been
informed
of
the
office
he
holds
in
venice
what
difficulty
will
he
find
in
saving
a
man
of
whom
he
himself
is
the
only
accuser
this
suggestion
of
the
prince
was
but
too
well
justified
by
the
event
for
some
days
after
on
inquiring
after
the
prisoner
we
were
told
that
he
had
escaped
and
had
not
since
been
heard
of
you
ask
what
could
be
his
motives
for
delivering
this
man
into
the
hands
of
justice
continued
the
prince
by
what
other
method
except
this
violent
one
could
he
have
wrested
from
the
sicilian
such
an
infamous
and
improbable
confession
which
however
was
so
material
to
the
success
of
his
plan
who
but
a
man
whose
case
is
desperate
and
who
has
nothing
to
lose
would
consent
to
give
so
humiliating
an
account
of
himself
under
what
other
circumstances
could
we
have
believed
such
a
confession
i
grant
all
this
my
prince
that
the
two
apparitions
were
mere
contrivances
of
art
that
the
sicilian
has
imposed
upon
us
a
tale
which
the
armenian
his
master
had
previously
taught
him
that
the
efforts
of
both
have
been
directed
to
the
same
end
and
from
this
mutual
intelligence
all
the
wonderful
incidents
which
have
astonished
us
in
this
adventure
may
be
easily
explained
but
the
prophecy
in
the
square
of
mark
that
first
miracle
which
as
it
were
opened
the
door
to
all
the
rest
still
remains
unexplained
and
of
what
use
is
the
key
to
all
his
other
wonders
if
we
despair
of
resolving
this
single
one
rather
invert
the
proposition
my
dear
count
answered
the
prince
and
say
what
do
all
these
wonders
prove
if
i
can
demonstrate
that
a
single
one
among
them
is
a
juggling
trick
the
prediction
i
own
is
totally
beyond
my
conception
if
it
stood
alone
if
the
armenian
had
closed
the
scene
with
it
instead
of
beginning
it
i
confess
i
do
not
know
how
far
i
might
have
been
carried
but
in
the
base
alloy
with
which
it
is
mixed
it
is
certainly
rather
suspicious
time
may
explain
or
not
explain
it
but
believe
me
my
friend
added
the
prince
taking
my
hand
with
a
grave
countenance
a
man
who
can
command
supernatural
powers
has
no
occasion
to
employ
the
arts
of
a
juggler
he
despises
thus
says
count
o
ended
a
conversation
which
i
have
related
word
for
word
because
it
shows
the
difficulties
which
were
to
be
overcome
before
the
prince
could
be
effectually
imposed
upon
and
i
hope
it
may
free
his
memory
from
the
imputation
of
having
blindly
and
inconsiderately
thrown
himself
into
a
snare
which
was
spread
for
his
destruction
by
the
most
unexampled
and
diabolical
wickedness
not
all
continues
count
o
who
at
the
moment
i
am
writing
smile
contemptuously
at
the
prince
s
credulity
and
in
the
fancied
superiority
of
their
own
yet
untempted
understanding
unconditionally
condemn
him
not
all
of
these
i
apprehend
would
have
stood
his
first
trial
so
courageously
if
afterwards
notwithstanding
this
providential
warning
we
witness
his
downfall
if
we
see
that
the
black
design
against
which
at
the
very
outset
he
was
thus
cautioned
is
finally
successful
we
shall
be
less
inclined
to
ridicule
his
weakness
than
to
be
astonished
at
the
infamous
ingenuity
of
a
plot
which
could
seduce
an
understanding
so
fully
prepared
considerations
of
worldly
interest
can
have
no
influence
upon
my
testimony
he
who
alone
would
be
thankful
for
it
is
now
no
more
his
dreadful
destiny
is
accomplished
his
soul
has
long
since
been
purified
before
the
throne
of
truth
where
mine
will
likewise
have
appeared
before
these
passages
meet
the
eyes
of
the
world
pardon
the
involuntary
tears
which
now
flow
at
the
remembrance
of
my
dearest
friend
but
for
the
sake
of
justice
i
must
write
this
his
was
a
noble
character
and
would
have
adorned
a
throne
which
seduced
by
the
most
atrocious
artifice
he
attempted
to
ascend
by
the
commission
of
a
crime
book
ii
not
long
after
these
events
continues
count
o
in
his
narrative
i
began
to
observe
an
extraordinary
alteration
in
the
disposition
of
the
prince
which
was
partly
the
immediate
consequence
of
the
last
event
and
partly
produced
by
the
concurrence
of
many
adventitious
circumstances
hitherto
he
had
avoided
every
severe
trial
of
his
faith
and
contented
himself
with
purifying
the
rude
and
abstract
notions
of
religion
in
which
he
had
been
educated
by
those
more
rational
ideas
upon
this
subject
which
forced
themselves
upon
his
attention
or
comparing
the
many
discordant
opinions
with
each
other
without
inquiring
into
the
foundations
of
his
faith
religious
subjects
he
has
many
times
confessed
to
me
always
appeared
to
him
like
an
enchanted
castle
into
which
one
does
not
set
one
s
foot
without
horror
and
that
they
act
therefore
much
the
wiser
part
who
pass
it
in
respectful
silence
without
exposing
themselves
to
the
danger
of
being
bewildered
in
its
labyrinths
a
servile
and
bigoted
education
was
the
source
of
this
dread
this
had
impressed
frightful
images
upon
his
tender
brain
which
during
the
remainder
of
his
life
he
was
never
able
wholly
to
obliterate
religious
melancholy
was
an
hereditary
disorder
in
his
family
the
education
which
he
and
his
brothers
had
received
was
calculated
to
produce
it
and
the
men
to
whose
care
they
were
entrusted
selected
with
this
object
were
also
either
enthusiasts
or
hypocrites
to
stifle
all
the
sprightliness
of
the
boy
by
a
gloomy
restraint
of
his
mental
faculties
was
the
only
method
of
securing
to
themselves
the
highest
approbation
of
his
royal
parents
the
whole
of
our
prince
s
childhood
wore
a
dark
and
gloomy
aspect
mirth
was
banished
even
from
his
amusements
all
his
ideas
of
religion
were
accompanied
by
some
frightful
image
and
the
representations
of
terror
and
severity
were
those
which
first
took
hold
of
his
lively
imagination
and
which
the
longest
retained
their
empire
over
it
his
god
was
an
object
of
terror
a
being
whose
occupation
is
to
chastise
and
the
adoration
he
paid
him
was
either
slavish
fear
or
a
blind
submission
which
stifled
all
his
energies
in
all
his
youthful
propensities
which
a
vigorous
growth
and
a
fine
constitution
naturally
excited
to
break
out
with
the
greater
violence
religion
stood
in
his
way
it
opposed
everything
upon
which
his
young
heart
was
bent
he
learned
to
consider
it
not
as
a
friend
but
as
the
scourge
of
his
passions
so
that
a
silent
indignation
was
gradually
kindled
against
it
in
his
heart
which
together
with
a
bigoted
faith
and
a
blind
fear
produced
an
incongruous
mixture
of
feelings
and
an
abhorrence
of
a
ruler
before
whom
he
trembled
it
is
no
wonder
therefore
that
he
took
the
first
opportunity
of
escaping
from
so
galling
a
yoke
but
he
fled
from
it
as
a
who
escaping
from
his
rigorous
master
drags
along
with
him
a
sense
of
his
servitude
even
in
the
midst
of
freedom
for
as
he
did
not
renounce
the
faith
of
his
earlier
years
from
a
deliberate
conviction
and
did
not
wait
till
the
maturity
and
improvement
of
his
reasoning
had
weaned
him
from
it
but
escaped
from
it
like
a
fugitive
upon
whose
person
the
rights
of
his
master
are
still
in
force
so
was
he
obliged
even
after
his
widest
separation
to
return
to
it
at
last
he
had
escaped
with
his
chain
and
for
that
reason
must
necessarily
become
the
prey
of
any
one
who
should
discover
it
and
know
how
to
make
use
of
the
discovery
that
such
a
one
presented
himself
the
sequel
of
this
history
will
prove
most
likely
the
reader
has
already
surmised
it
the
confessions
of
the
sicilian
left
a
deeper
impression
upon
his
mind
than
they
ought
considering
the
circumstances
and
the
small
victory
which
his
reason
had
thence
gained
over
this
weak
imposture
remarkably
increased
his
reliance
upon
his
own
powers
the
facility
with
which
he
had
been
able
to
unravel
this
deception
appeared
to
have
surprised
him
truth
and
error
were
not
yet
so
accurately
distinguished
from
each
other
in
his
mind
but
that
he
often
mistook
the
arguments
which
were
in
favor
of
the
one
for
those
in
favor
of
the
other
thence
it
arose
that
the
same
blow
which
destroyed
his
faith
in
wonders
made
the
whole
edifice
of
it
totter
in
this
instance
he
fell
into
the
same
error
as
an
inexperienced
man
who
has
been
deceived
in
love
or
friendship
because
he
happened
to
make
a
bad
choice
and
who
denies
the
existence
of
these
sensations
because
he
takes
the
occasional
exceptions
for
distinguishing
features
the
unmasking
of
a
deception
made
even
truth
suspicious
to
him
because
he
had
unfortunately
discovered
truth
by
false
reasoning
this
imaginary
triumph
pleased
him
in
proportion
to
the
magnitude
of
the
oppression
from
which
it
seemed
to
deliver
him
from
this
instant
there
arose
in
his
mind
a
scepticism
which
did
not
spare
even
the
most
sacred
objects
many
circumstances
concurred
to
encourage
and
still
more
to
confirm
him
in
this
turn
of
mind
he
now
quitted
the
retirement
in
which
he
had
hitherto
lived
and
gave
way
to
a
more
dissipated
mode
of
life
his
rank
was
discovered
attentions
which
he
was
obliged
to
return
etiquettes
for
which
he
was
indebted
to
his
rank
drew
him
imperceptibly
within
the
vortex
of
the
great
world
his
rank
as
well
as
his
personal
attractions
opened
to
him
the
circles
of
all
the
beaux
esprits
in
venice
and
he
soon
found
himself
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
the
most
enlightened
persons
in
the
republic
men
of
learning
as
well
as
politicians
this
obliged
him
to
en
large
the
monotonous
and
limited
circle
to
which
his
understanding
had
hitherto
been
confined
he
began
to
perceive
the
poverty
and
feebleness
of
his
ideas
and
to
feel
the
want
of
more
elevated
impressions
the
turn
of
his
understanding
in
spite
of
the
many
advantages
with
which
it
was
accompanied
formed
an
unpleasing
contrast
with
the
current
ideas
of
society
his
ignorance
of
the
commonest
things
frequently
exposed
him
to
ridicule
than
which
he
dreaded
nothing
more
the
unfortunate
prejudice
which
attached
to
his
native
country
appeared
to
him
a
challenge
to
overcome
it
in
his
own
person
besides
this
there
was
a
peculiarity
in
his
character
he
was
offended
with
every
attention
that
he
thought
was
paid
him
on
account
of
his
rank
rather
than
his
personal
qualities
he
felt
this
humiliation
principally
in
the
company
of
persons
who
shone
by
their
abilities
and
triumphed
as
it
were
over
their
birth
by
their
merit
to
perceive
himself
distinguished
as
a
prince
in
such
a
society
was
always
a
deep
humiliation
to
him
because
he
unfortunately
fancied
himself
excluded
by
his
rank
from
all
competition
these
circumstances
convinced
him
of
the
necessity
of
cultivating
his
mind
in
order
to
raise
it
to
a
level
with
the
thinking
part
of
the
world
from
which
he
had
hitherto
been
so
separated
and
for
that
purpose
he
chose
the
most
modern
books
and
applied
himself
to
them
with
all
the
ardor
with
which
he
was
accustomed
to
pursue
every
object
to
which
he
devoted
himself
but
the
unskilful
hand
that
directed
his
choice
always
prompted
him
to
select
such
as
were
little
calculated
to
improve
either
his
heart
or
his
reason
besides
that
he
was
influenced
by
a
propensity
which
rendered
everything
irresistible
which
was
incomprehensible
he
had
neither
attention
nor
memory
for
anything
that
was
not
of
that
character
and
both
his
reason
and
his
heart
remained
untouched
while
he
was
filling
the
vacuities
of
his
brain
with
confused
ideas
the
dazzling
style
of
some
writers
captivated
his
imagination
while
the
subtlety
of
others
ensnared
his
reason
together
they
easily
took
possession
of
a
mind
which
became
the
prey
of
whatever
was
obtruded
upon
it
with
a
certain
degree
of
dogmatism
a
course
of
reading
which
had
been
continued
with
ardor
for
more
than
a
year
had
scarcely
enriched
him
with
one
benevolent
idea
but
had
filled
his
head
with
doubts
which
as
a
natural
consequence
with
such
a
character
had
almost
found
an
unfortunate
road
to
his
heart
in
a
word
he
had
entered
this
labyrinth
as
a
credulous
enthusiast
had
left
it
as
a
sceptic
and
at
length
became
a
perfect
among
the
circles
into
which
he
had
been
introduced
there
was
a
private
society
called
the
bucentauro
which
under
the
mask
of
a
noble
and
rational
liberality
of
sentiment
encouraged
the
most
unbridled
licentiousness
of
manners
and
opinion
as
it
enumerated
many
of
the
clergy
among
its
members
and
could
even
boast
of
some
cardinals
at
its
head
the
prince
was
the
more
easily
induced
to
join
it
he
thought
that
certain
dangerous
truths
which
reason
discovers
could
be
nowhere
better
preserved
than
in
the
hands
of
such
persons
whose
rank
compelled
them
to
moderation
and
who
had
the
advantage
of
hearing
and
examining
the
other
side
of
the
question
the
prince
did
not
recollect
that
licentiousness
of
sentiment
and
manners
takes
so
much
the
stronger
hold
among
persons
of
this
rank
inasmuch
as
they
for
that
reason
feel
one
curb
less
and
this
was
the
case
with
the
bucentauro
most
of
whose
members
through
an
execrable
philosophy
and
manners
worthy
of
such
a
guide
were
not
only
a
disgrace
to
their
own
rank
but
even
to
human
nature
itself
the
society
had
its
secret
degrees
and
i
will
believe
for
the
credit
of
the
prince
that
they
never
thought
him
worthy
of
admission
into
the
inmost
sanctuary
every
one
who
entered
this
society
was
obliged
at
least
so
long
as
he
continued
to
be
a
member
of
it
to
lay
aside
all
distinctions
arising
from
rank
nation
or
religion
in
short
every
general
mark
or
distinction
whatever
and
to
submit
himself
to
the
condition
of
universal
equality
to
be
elected
a
member
was
indeed
a
difficult
matter
as
superiority
of
understanding
alone
paved
the
way
to
it
the
society
boasted
of
the
highest
ton
and
the
most
cultivated
taste
and
such
indeed
was
its
fame
throughout
all
venice
this
as
well
as
the
appearance
of
equality
which
predominated
in
it
attracted
the
prince
irresistibly
sensible
conversations
set
off
by
the
most
admirable
humor
instructive
amusements
and
the
flower
of
the
learned
and
political
world
which
were
all
attracted
to
this
point
as
to
their
common
centre
concealed
from
him
for
a
long
time
the
danger
of
this
connection
as
he
by
degrees
discovered
through
its
mask
the
spirit
of
the
institution
as
they
grew
tired
of
being
any
longer
on
their
guard
before
him
to
recede
was
dangerous
and
false
shame
and
anxiety
for
his
safety
obliged
him
to
conceal
the
displeasure
he
felt
but
he
already
began
merely
from
familiarity
with
men
of
this
class
and
their
sentiments
though
they
did
not
excite
him
to
imitation
to
lose
the
pure
and
charming
simplicity
of
his
character
and
the
delicacy
of
his
moral
feelings
his
understanding
supported
by
real
knowledge
could
not
without
foreign
assistance
solve
the
fallacious
sophisms
with
which
he
had
been
here
ensnared
and
this
fatal
poison
had
already
destroyed
all
or
nearly
all
the
basis
on
which
his
morality
rested
he
surrendered
the
natural
and
indispensable
safeguards
of
his
happiness
for
sophisms
which
deserted
him
at
the
critical
moment
and
he
was
consequently
left
to
the
operation
of
any
specious
argument
which
came
in
his
way
perhaps
the
hand
of
a
friend
might
yet
have
been
in
time
to
extricate
him
from
this
abyss
but
besides
that
i
did
not
become
acquainted
with
the
real
character
of
the
bucentauro
till
long
after
the
evil
had
taken
place
an
urgent
circumstance
called
me
away
from
venice
just
at
the
beginning
of
this
period
lord
seymour
too
a
valuable
acquaintance
of
the
prince
whose
cool
understanding
was
proof
against
every
species
of
deception
and
who
would
have
infallibly
been
a
secure
support
to
him
left
us
at
this
time
in
order
to
return
to
his
native
country
those
in
whose
hands
i
left
the
prince
were
indeed
worthy
men
but
inexperienced
excessively
narrow
in
their
religious
opinions
deficient
in
their
perception
of
the
evil
and
wanting
in
credit
with
the
prince
they
had
nothing
to
oppose
to
his
captious
sophisms
except
the
maxims
of
a
blind
and
uninquiring
faith
which
either
irritated
him
or
excited
his
ridicule
he
saw
through
them
too
easily
and
his
superior
reason
soon
silenced
those
weak
defenders
of
the
good
cause
as
will
be
clearly
evinced
from
an
instance
which
i
shall
introduce
in
the
sequel
those
who
subsequent
to
this
possessed
themselves
of
his
confidence
were
much
more
interested
in
plunging
him
deeper
into
error
when
i
returned
to
venice
in
the
following
year
how
great
a
change
had
already
taken
place
in
everything
the
influence
of
this
new
philosophy
soon
showed
itself
in
the
prince
s
conduct
the
more
openly
he
pursued
pleasure
and
acquired
new
friends
the
more
did
he
lose
in
the
estimation
of
his
old
ones
he
pleased
me
less
and
less
every
day
we
saw
each
other
more
seldom
and
indeed
he
was
seldom
accessible
he
had
launched
out
into
the
torrent
of
the
great
world
his
threshold
was
eternally
thronged
when
he
was
at
home
amusements
banquets
and
galas
followed
each
other
in
rapid
succession
he
was
the
idol
whom
every
one
courted
the
great
attraction
of
every
circle
in
proportion
as
he
in
his
secluded
life
had
fancied
living
in
society
to
be
difficult
did
he
to
his
astonishment
find
it
easy
everything
met
his
wishes
whatever
he
uttered
was
admirable
and
when
he
remained
silent
it
was
like
committing
a
robbery
upon
the
company
they
understood
the
art
of
drawing
his
thoughts
insensibly
from
his
soul
and
then
with
a
little
delicate
management
to
surprise
him
with
them
this
happiness
which
accompanied
him
everywhere
and
this
universal
success
raised
him
indeed
too
much
in
his
own
ideas
because
it
gave
him
too
much
confidence
and
too
much
reliance
upon
himself
the
heightened
opinion
which
he
thus
acquired
of
his
own
worth
made
him
credit
the
excessive
and
almost
idolatrous
adoration
that
was
paid
to
his
understanding
which
but
for
this
increased
must
have
necessarily
recalled
him
from
his
aberrations
for
the
present
however
this
universal
voice
was
only
a
confirmation
of
what
his
complacent
vanity
whispered
in
his
ear
a
tribute
which
he
felt
entitled
to
by
right
he
would
have
infallibly
disengaged
himself
from
this
snare
had
they
allowed
him
to
take
breath
had
they
granted
him
a
moment
of
uninterrupted
leisure
to
compare
his
real
merit
with
the
picture
that
was
exhibited
to
him
in
this
seducing
mirror
but
his
existence
was
a
continued
state
of
intoxication
a
whirl
of
excitement
the
higher
he
had
been
elevated
the
more
difficulty
had
he
to
support
himself
in
his
elevation
this
incessant
exertion
slowly
undermined
him
rest
had
forsaken
even
his
slumbers
his
weakness
had
been
discovered
and
the
passion
kindled
in
his
breast
turned
to
good
account
his
worthy
attendants
soon
found
to
their
cost
that
their
lord
had
become
a
wit
that
anxious
sensibility
those
glorious
truths
which
his
heart
once
embraced
with
the
greatest
enthusiasm
now
began
to
be
the
objects
of
his
ridicule
he
revenged
himself
on
the
great
truths
of
religion
for
the
oppression
which
he
had
so
long
suffered
from
misconception
but
since
from
too
true
a
voice
his
heart
combated
the
intoxication
of
his
head
there
was
more
of
acrimony
than
of
humor
in
his
jests
his
disposition
began
to
alter
and
caprice
to
exhibit
itself
the
most
beautiful
ornament
of
his
character
his
modesty
vanished
parasites
had
poisoned
his
excellent
heart
that
tender
delicacy
of
address
which
frequently
made
his
attendants
forget
that
he
was
their
lord
now
gave
place
to
a
decisive
and
despotic
tone
which
made
the
more
sensible
impression
because
it
was
not
founded
upon
distinction
of
rank
for
the
want
of
which
they
could
have
consoled
themselves
but
upon
an
arrogant
estimation
of
his
own
superior
merit
when
at
home
he
was
attacked
by
reflections
that
seldom
made
their
appearance
in
the
bustle
of
company
his
own
people
scarcely
ever
saw
him
otherwise
than
gloomy
peevish
and
unhappy
whilst
elsewhere
a
forced
vivacity
made
him
the
soul
of
every
circle
with
the
sincerest
sorrow
did
we
behold
him
treading
this
dangerous
path
but
in
the
vortex
in
which
he
was
involved
the
feeble
voice
of
friendship
was
no
longer
heard
and
he
was
too
much
intoxicated
to
understand
it
just
at
the
beginning
of
this
epoch
an
affair
of
the
greatest
consequence
required
my
presence
in
the
court
of
my
sovereign
which
i
dared
not
postpone
even
for
the
dearest
interests
of
friendship
an
invisible
hand
the
agency
of
which
i
did
not
discover
till
long
afterwards
had
contrived
to
derange
my
affairs
and
to
spread
reports
concerning
me
which
i
was
obliged
to
contradict
by
my
presence
the
parting
from
the
prince
was
painful
to
me
but
did
not
affect
him
the
ties
which
united
us
had
been
severed
for
some
time
but
his
fate
had
awakened
all
my
anxiety
i
on
that
account
prevailed
on
baron
von
f
to
inform
me
by
letter
of
every
event
which
he
has
done
in
the
most
conscientious
manner
as
i
was
for
a
considerable
time
no
longer
an
of
these
events
it
will
be
allowable
for
me
to
introduce
the
baron
von
f
in
my
stead
and
to
fill
up
the
gap
in
my
narrative
by
the
contents
of
his
letters
notwithstanding
that
the
representation
of
my
friend
f
is
not
always
what
i
should
have
given
i
would
not
alter
any
of
his
expressions
so
that
the
reader
will
be
enabled
to
discover
the
truth
with
very
little
letter
baron
von
f
to
count
von
o
may
i
thank
you
my
most
honored
friend
for
the
permission
you
have
given
me
to
continue
in
your
absence
that
confidential
intercourse
with
you
which
during
your
stay
here
formed
my
great
pleasure
you
must
be
aware
that
there
is
no
one
here
with
whom
i
can
venture
to
open
my
heart
on
certain
private
matters
whatever
you
may
urge
to
the
contrary
i
detest
the
people
here
since
the
prince
has
become
one
of
them
and
since
we
have
lost
your
society
i
feel
solitary
in
the
midst
of
this
populous
city
z
takes
it
less
to
heart
and
the
fair
ones
of
venice
manage
to
make
him
forget
the
mortifications
he
is
compelled
to
share
with
me
at
home
and
why
should
he
make
himself
unhappy
he
desires
nothing
more
in
the
prince
than
a
master
whom
he
could
also
find
elsewhere
but
i
you
know
how
deep
an
interest
i
feel
in
our
prince
s
weal
and
woe
and
how
much
cause
i
have
for
doing
so
i
have
now
lived
with
him
sixteen
years
and
seem
to
exist
only
for
his
sake
as
a
boy
of
nine
years
old
i
first
entered
his
service
and
since
that
time
we
have
never
been
separated
i
have
grown
up
under
his
eye
a
long
intercourse
has
insensibly
attached
me
more
and
more
to
him
i
have
borne
a
part
in
all
his
adventures
great
and
small
until
this
last
unhappy
year
i
had
been
accustomed
to
look
upon
him
in
the
light
of
a
friend
or
of
an
elder
brother
i
have
basked
in
his
smile
as
in
the
sunshine
of
a
summer
s
day
no
cloud
hung
over
my
happiness
and
all
this
must
now
go
to
ruin
in
this
unlucky
venice
since
your
departure
several
changes
have
taken
place
in
our
establishment
the
prince
of
d
arrived
here
last
week
with
a
numerous
and
brilliant
retinue
and
has
caused
a
new
and
tumultuous
life
in
our
circle
as
he
is
so
nearly
related
to
our
prince
and
as
they
are
moreover
at
present
upon
pretty
good
terms
they
will
be
very
little
apart
during
his
sojourn
which
i
hear
is
to
last
until
after
the
feast
of
the
ascension
a
good
beginning
has
already
been
made
for
the
last
ten
days
our
prince
has
hardly
had
time
to
breathe
the
prince
of
d
has
all
along
been
living
in
a
very
expensive
way
which
was
excusable
in
him
as
he
will
soon
take
his
departure
but
the
worst
of
the
business
is
that
he
has
inoculated
our
prince
with
his
extravagance
because
he
could
not
well
withdraw
himself
from
his
company
and
in
the
peculiar
relation
which
exists
between
the
two
houses
thought
it
incumbent
upon
himself
to
assert
the
dignity
of
his
own
we
shall
moreover
depart
from
venice
in
a
few
weeks
which
will
relieve
the
prince
from
the
necessity
of
continuing
for
any
length
of
time
this
extraordinary
expenditure
the
prince
of
d
it
is
reported
is
here
on
business
of
the
order
in
which
he
imagines
that
he
plays
an
important
part
that
he
has
taken
advantage
of
all
the
acquaintances
of
our
prince
you
may
readily
imagine
he
has
been
introduced
with
distinguished
honor
into
the
society
of
the
bucentauro
as
he
is
pleased
to
consider
himself
a
wit
and
a
man
of
great
genius
and
allows
himself
to
be
styled
in
his
correspondences
which
he
keeps
up
throughout
all
parts
of
the
world
the
prince
i
do
not
know
whether
you
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
him
he
displays
a
promising
exterior
piercing
eyes
a
countenance
full
of
expression
much
show
of
reading
much
acquired
naturalness
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
expression
joined
to
a
princely
condescension
towards
the
human
race
a
large
amount
of
confidence
in
himself
and
an
eloquence
which
talks
down
all
opposition
who
could
refuse
to
pay
homage
to
such
splendid
qualities
in
a
royal
highness
but
to
what
advantage
the
quiet
and
sterling
worth
of
our
prince
will
appear
when
contrasted
with
these
dazzling
accomplishments
the
event
must
show
in
the
arrangement
of
our
establishment
various
and
important
changes
have
taken
place
we
have
rented
a
new
and
magnificent
house
opposite
the
new
procuracy
because
the
lodging
at
the
moor
hotel
became
too
confined
for
the
prince
our
suite
has
been
augmented
by
twelve
persons
pages
moors
guards
etc
during
your
stay
here
you
complained
of
unnecessary
expense
you
should
see
us
now
our
internal
arrangements
remain
the
same
as
of
old
except
that
the
prince
no
longer
held
in
check
by
your
presence
is
if
possible
more
reserved
and
distant
towards
us
than
ever
we
see
very
little
of
him
except
while
dressing
or
undressing
him
under
the
pretext
that
we
speak
the
french
language
very
badly
and
the
italian
not
at
all
he
has
found
means
to
exclude
us
from
most
of
his
entertainments
which
to
me
personally
is
not
a
very
great
grievance
but
i
believe
i
know
the
true
reason
of
it
he
is
ashamed
of
us
and
this
hurts
me
for
we
have
not
deserved
it
of
him
as
you
wish
to
know
all
our
minor
affairs
i
must
tell
you
that
of
all
his
attendants
the
prince
almost
exclusively
employs
biondello
whom
he
took
into
his
service
as
you
will
recollect
on
the
disappearance
of
his
huntsman
and
who
in
his
new
mode
of
life
has
become
quite
indispensable
to
him
this
man
knows
venice
thoroughly
and
turns
everything
to
some
account
it
is
as
though
he
had
a
thousand
eyes
and
could
set
a
thousand
hands
in
motion
at
once
this
he
accomplishes
as
he
says
by
the
help
of
the
gondoliers
to
the
prince
he
renders
himself
very
useful
by
making
him
acquainted
with
all
the
strange
faces
that
present
themselves
at
his
assemblies
and
the
private
information
he
gives
his
highness
has
always
proved
to
be
correct
besides
this
he
speaks
and
writes
both
italian
and
french
excellently
and
has
in
consequence
already
risen
to
be
the
prince
s
secretary
i
must
however
relate
to
you
an
instance
of
fidelity
in
him
which
is
rarely
found
among
people
of
his
station
the
other
day
a
merchant
of
good
standing
from
rimini
requested
an
audience
of
the
prince
the
object
of
his
visit
was
an
extraordinary
complaint
concerning
biondello
the
procurator
his
former
master
who
must
have
been
rather
an
odd
fellow
had
lived
in
irreconcilable
enmity
with
his
relations
this
enmity
he
wished
if
possible
to
continue
even
after
his
death
biondello
possessed
his
entire
confidence
and
was
the
repository
of
all
his
secrets
while
on
his
deathbed
he
obliged
him
to
swear
that
he
would
keep
them
inviolably
and
would
never
disclose
them
for
the
benefit
of
his
relations
a
handsome
legacy
was
to
be
the
reward
of
his
silence
when
the
deceased
procurator
s
will
was
opened
and
his
papers
inspected
many
blanks
and
irregularities
were
found
to
which
biondello
alone
could
furnish
a
key
he
persisted
in
denying
that
he
knew
anything
about
it
gave
up
his
very
handsome
legacy
to
the
heirs
and
kept
his
secrets
to
himself
large
offers
were
made
to
him
by
the
relations
but
all
in
vain
at
length
in
order
to
escape
from
their
importunities
and
their
threats
of
legally
prosecuting
him
he
entered
the
service
of
the
prince
the
merchant
who
was
the
chief
heir
now
applied
to
the
prince
and
made
larger
offers
than
before
if
biondello
would
alter
his
determination
but
even
the
persuasions
of
the
prince
were
fruitless
he
admitted
that
secrets
of
consequence
had
really
been
confided
to
him
he
did
not
deny
that
the
deceased
had
perhaps
carried
his
enmity
towards
his
relations
too
far
but
added
he
he
was
my
dear
master
and
benefactor
and
died
with
a
firm
belief
in
my
integrity
i
was
the
only
friend
he
had
left
in
the
world
and
will
therefore
never
prove
myself
unworthy
of
his
confidence
at
the
same
time
he
hinted
that
the
avowals
they
wished
him
to
make
would
not
tend
to
the
honor
of
the
deceased
was
not
that
acting
nobly
and
delicately
you
may
easily
imagine
that
the
prince
did
not
renew
his
endeavors
to
shake
so
praiseworthy
a
determination
the
extraordinary
fidelity
which
he
has
shown
towards
his
deceased
master
has
procured
him
the
unlimited
confidence
of
his
present
one
farewell
my
dear
friend
how
i
sigh
for
the
quiet
life
we
led
when
first
you
came
amongst
us
for
the
stillness
of
which
your
society
so
agreeably
indemnified
us
i
fear
my
happy
days
in
venice
are
over
and
shall
be
glad
if
the
same
remark
does
not
also
apply
to
the
prince
the
element
in
which
he
now
lives
is
not
calculated
to
render
him
permanently
happy
or
my
sixteen
years
experience
has
deceived
me
letter
ii
baron
von
f
to
count
von
o
june
i
should
never
have
thought
that
our
stay
at
venice
would
have
been
productive
of
any
good
consequences
it
has
been
the
means
of
saving
a
man
s
life
and
i
am
reconciled
to
it
some
few
evenings
ago
the
prince
was
being
carried
home
late
at
night
from
the
bucentauro
two
domestics
of
whom
biondello
was
one
accompanied
him
by
some
accident
it
happened
that
the
sedan
which
had
been
hired
in
haste
broke
down
and
the
prince
was
obliged
to
proceed
the
remainder
of
the
foot
biondello
walked
in
front
their
course
lay
through
several
dark
retired
streets
and
as
daybreak
was
at
hand
the
lamps
were
either
burning
dimly
or
had
gone
out
altogether
they
had
proceeded
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
biondello
discovered
that
he
had
lost
his
way
the
similarity
of
the
bridges
had
deceived
him
and
instead
of
crossing
that
of
mark
they
found
themselves
in
sestiere
di
castello
it
was
in
a
and
not
a
soul
was
stirring
they
were
obliged
to
turn
back
in
order
to
gain
a
main
street
by
which
to
set
themselves
right
they
had
proceeded
but
a
few
paces
when
they
heard
cries
of
murder
in
a
neighboring
street
with
his
usual
determined
courage
the
prince
unarmed
as
he
was
snatched
a
stick
from
one
of
his
attendants
and
rushed
forward
in
the
direction
whence
the
sound
came
three
fellows
were
just
about
to
assassinate
a
man
who
with
his
companion
was
feebly
defending
himself
the
prince
appeared
just
in
time
to
arrest
the
fatal
blow
the
voices
of
the
prince
and
his
followers
alarmed
the
murderers
who
did
not
expect
any
interruption
in
so
lonely
a
place
after
inflicting
a
few
slight
wounds
with
their
daggers
they
abandoned
their
victim
and
took
to
their
heels
exhausted
with
the
unequal
combat
the
wounded
man
sunk
half
fainting
into
the
arms
of
the
prince
his
companion
informed
my
master
that
the
man
whose
life
he
had
saved
was
the
marquis
civitella
a
nephew
of
the
cardinal
a
as
the
marquis
wounds
bled
freely
biondello
acted
as
surgeon
to
the
best
of
his
ability
and
the
prince
took
care
to
have
him
conveyed
to
the
palace
of
his
uncle
which
was
near
at
hand
and
whither
he
himself
accompanied
him
this
done
he
left
the
house
without
revealing
his
name
this
however
was
discovered
by
a
servant
who
had
recognized
biondello
already
on
the
following
morning
the
cardinal
an
old
acquaintance
from
the
bucentauro
waited
upon
the
prince
the
interview
lasted
an
hour
the
cardinal
was
much
moved
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
when
they
parted
the
prince
too
was
affected
the
same
evening
a
visit
was
paid
to
the
sick
man
of
whose
case
the
surgeon
gives
a
very
favorable
report
the
mantle
in
which
he
was
wrapped
had
rendered
the
thrusts
unsteady
and
weakened
their
force
since
this
event
not
a
day
has
passed
without
the
prince
s
paying
a
visit
at
the
cardinal
s
or
receiving
one
from
him
and
a
close
intimacy
has
begun
to
exist
between
him
and
the
cardinal
s
family
the
cardinal
is
a
venerable
man
of
sixty
with
a
majestic
aspect
but
full
of
gayety
and
good
health
he
is
said
to
be
the
richest
prelate
throughout
all
the
dominions
of
the
republic
he
is
reported
to
manage
his
immense
fortune
in
a
very
liberal
manner
and
although
prudently
economical
to
despise
none
of
the
joys
of
this
life
this
nephew
who
is
his
sole
heir
is
not
always
on
the
best
of
terms
with
his
uncle
for
although
the
cardinal
is
anything
but
an
enemy
to
youthful
pleasures
the
conduct
of
the
nephew
must
exhaust
the
utmost
tolerance
his
loose
principles
and
dissipated
manner
of
living
aided
unhappily
by
all
the
attractions
which
can
make
vice
tempting
and
excite
sensuality
have
rendered
him
the
terror
of
all
fathers
and
the
bane
of
all
husbands
this
last
attack
also
was
said
to
have
been
caused
by
an
intrigue
he
had
begun
with
the
wife
of
the
ambassador
without
speaking
of
other
serious
broils
from
which
the
power
and
the
money
of
the
cardinal
could
scarcely
extricate
him
but
for
this
the
cardinal
would
be
the
happiest
man
in
italy
for
he
possesses
everything
that
can
make
life
agreeable
but
by
this
one
domestic
misfortune
all
the
gifts
of
fortune
are
annulled
and
the
enjoyment
of
his
wealth
is
embittered
to
the
cardinal
by
the
continual
fear
of
finding
nobody
to
inherit
it
the
whole
of
this
information
i
have
obtained
from
biondello
the
prince
has
found
in
this
man
a
real
treasure
every
day
he
becomes
more
indispensable
and
we
are
continually
discovering
in
him
some
new
talent
some
days
ago
the
prince
felt
feverish
and
could
not
sleep
the
was
extinguished
and
all
his
ringing
failed
to
arouse
the
who
had
gone
to
sleep
out
of
the
house
with
an
at
length
the
prince
determined
to
rise
himself
and
to
rouse
one
of
his
people
he
had
not
proceeded
far
when
a
strain
of
delicious
melody
met
his
ear
like
one
enchanted
he
followed
the
sound
and
found
biondello
in
his
room
playing
upon
the
flute
with
his
assembled
around
him
the
prince
could
hardly
believe
his
senses
and
commanded
him
to
proceed
with
a
surprising
degree
of
facility
he
began
to
vary
a
touching
adagio
air
with
some
fine
extempore
variations
which
he
executed
with
all
the
taste
of
a
virtuoso
the
prince
who
as
you
know
is
a
judge
of
music
says
that
he
might
play
with
confidence
in
the
finest
choir
in
italy
i
must
dismiss
this
man
said
he
to
me
next
morning
for
i
am
unable
to
reward
him
according
to
his
biondello
who
had
overheard
these
words
came
forward
if
you
dismiss
me
gracious
prince
said
he
you
deprive
me
of
my
best
you
are
born
to
something
better
than
to
serve
answered
my
master
i
must
not
stand
in
the
way
of
your
do
not
press
upon
me
any
better
fortune
gracious
sir
than
that
which
i
have
chosen
for
to
neglect
talent
like
yours
no
i
can
never
permit
then
permit
me
gracious
sir
sometimes
to
exercise
it
in
your
preparations
were
immediately
made
for
carrying
this
proposition
into
effect
biondello
had
a
room
assigned
to
him
next
the
apartment
of
the
prince
so
that
he
can
lull
him
to
sleep
with
his
strains
and
wake
him
in
the
same
manner
the
prince
wished
to
double
his
salary
but
biondello
declined
requesting
that
this
intended
boon
should
be
retained
in
his
master
s
hands
as
a
capital
of
which
he
might
some
day
wish
to
avail
himself
the
prince
expects
that
he
will
soon
come
to
ask
a
favor
at
his
hands
and
whatever
it
may
be
it
is
granted
beforehand
farewell
dearest
friend
i
am
waiting
with
impatience
for
tidings
from
k
letter
iii
baron
von
f
to
count
von
o
june
the
marquis
of
civitella
who
is
now
entirely
recovered
from
his
wounds
was
last
week
introduced
to
the
prince
by
his
uncle
the
cardinal
and
since
then
he
has
followed
him
like
his
shadow
biondello
can
not
have
told
me
the
truth
respecting
this
marquis
or
at
any
rate
his
account
must
be
greatly
exaggerated
his
mien
is
highly
engaging
and
his
manners
irresistibly
winning
it
is
impossible
to
be
out
of
humor
with
him
the
first
sight
of
him
has
disarmed
me
imagine
a
man
of
the
most
enchanting
figure
with
corresponding
grace
and
dignity
a
countenance
full
of
thought
and
genius
an
expression
frank
and
inviting
a
persuasive
tone
of
voice
the
most
flowing
eloquence
and
a
glow
of
youthful
beauty
joined
to
all
the
advantages
of
a
most
liberal
education
he
has
none
of
that
contemptuous
pride
none
of
that
solemn
starchness
which
we
disliked
so
much
in
all
the
other
nobles
his
whole
being
is
redolent
of
youthful
joyousness
benevolence
and
warmth
of
feeling
his
excesses
must
have
been
much
exaggerated
i
never
saw
a
more
perfect
picture
of
health
if
he
is
really
so
wholly
abandoned
as
biondello
represents
him
he
is
a
syren
whom
none
can
resist
towards
me
he
behaved
with
much
frankness
he
confessed
with
the
most
pleasing
sincerity
that
he
was
by
no
means
on
the
best
of
terms
with
his
uncle
the
cardinal
and
that
it
was
his
own
fault
but
he
was
seriously
resolved
to
amend
his
life
and
the
merit
would
be
entirely
the
prince
s
at
the
same
time
he
hoped
through
his
instrumentality
to
be
reconciled
to
his
uncle
as
the
prince
s
influence
with
the
cardinal
was
unbounded
the
only
thing
he
had
wanted
till
now
was
a
friend
and
a
guide
and
he
trusted
he
should
find
both
in
the
person
of
the
prince
the
prince
has
now
assumed
the
authority
of
a
preceptor
towards
him
and
treats
him
with
all
the
watchfulness
fulness
and
strictness
of
a
mentor
but
this
intimacy
also
gives
the
marquis
a
certain
degree
of
influence
of
which
he
well
knows
how
to
avail
himself
he
hardly
stirs
from
his
side
he
is
present
at
all
parties
where
the
prince
is
one
of
the
guests
for
the
bucentauro
alone
he
is
fortunately
as
yet
too
young
wherever
be
appears
in
public
with
the
prince
he
manages
to
draw
him
away
from
the
rest
of
the
company
by
the
pleasing
manner
in
which
he
engages
him
in
conversation
and
arrests
his
attention
nobody
they
say
has
yet
been
able
to
reclaim
him
and
the
prince
will
deserve
to
be
immortalized
in
an
epic
should
he
accomplish
such
an
herculean
task
i
am
much
afraid
however
that
the
tables
may
be
turned
and
the
guide
be
led
away
by
the
pupil
of
which
in
fact
there
seems
to
be
every
prospect
the
prince
of
has
taken
his
departure
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
us
all
my
master
not
excepted
what
i
predicted
my
dear
o
has
come
to
pass
two
characters
so
widely
opposed
must
inevitably
clash
together
and
can
not
maintain
a
good
understanding
for
any
length
of
time
the
prince
of
had
not
been
long
in
venice
before
a
terrible
schism
took
place
in
the
intellectual
world
which
threatened
to
deprive
our
prince
of
of
his
admirers
wherever
he
went
he
was
crossed
by
this
rival
who
possessed
exactly
the
requisite
amount
of
small
cunning
to
avail
himself
of
every
little
advantage
he
gained
as
he
besides
never
scrupled
to
make
use
of
any
petty
manoeuvres
to
increase
his
consequence
he
in
a
short
time
drew
all
the
of
the
community
on
his
side
and
shone
at
the
head
of
a
company
of
parasites
worthy
of
such
a
leader
the
harsh
judgment
which
baron
f
both
here
and
in
some
passages
of
his
first
letter
pronounces
upon
this
talented
prince
will
be
found
exaggerated
by
every
one
who
has
the
good
fortune
to
be
acquainted
with
him
and
must
be
attributed
to
the
prejudiced
views
of
the
young
note
of
the
count
von
o
the
wiser
course
would
certainly
have
been
not
to
enter
into
competition
at
all
with
an
adversary
of
this
description
and
a
few
months
back
this
is
the
part
which
the
prince
would
have
taken
but
now
he
has
launched
too
far
into
the
stream
easily
to
regain
the
shore
these
trifles
have
perhaps
by
the
circumstances
in
which
he
is
placed
acquired
a
certain
degree
of
importance
in
his
eyes
and
had
he
even
despised
them
his
pride
would
not
have
allowed
him
to
retire
at
a
moment
when
his
yielding
would
have
been
looked
upon
less
as
a
voluntary
act
than
as
a
confession
of
inferiority
added
to
this
an
unlucky
revival
of
forgotten
satirical
speeches
had
taken
place
and
the
spirit
of
rivalry
which
took
possession
of
his
followers
had
affected
the
prince
himself
in
order
therefore
to
maintain
that
position
in
society
which
public
opinion
had
now
assigned
him
he
deemed
it
advisable
to
seize
every
possible
opportunity
of
display
and
of
increasing
the
number
of
his
admirers
but
this
could
only
be
effected
by
the
most
princely
expenditure
he
was
therefore
eternally
giving
feasts
entertainments
and
expensive
concerts
making
costly
presents
and
playing
high
as
this
strange
madness
moreover
had
also
infected
the
prince
s
retinue
who
are
generally
much
more
punctilious
in
respect
to
what
they
deem
the
honor
of
the
family
than
their
masters
the
prince
was
obliged
to
assist
the
zeal
of
his
followers
by
his
liberality
here
then
is
a
whole
catalogue
of
ills
all
irremediable
consequences
of
a
sufficiently
excusable
weakness
to
which
the
prince
in
an
unguarded
moment
gave
way
we
have
it
is
true
got
rid
of
our
rival
but
the
harm
he
has
done
will
not
so
soon
be
remedied
the
finances
of
the
prince
are
exhausted
all
that
he
had
saved
by
the
wise
economy
of
years
is
spent
and
he
must
hasten
from
venice
if
he
would
escape
plunging
into
debt
which
till
now
he
has
most
scrupulously
avoided
it
is
decisively
settled
that
we
leave
as
soon
as
fresh
remittances
arrive
i
should
not
have
minded
all
this
splendor
if
the
prince
had
but
reaped
the
least
real
satisfaction
from
it
but
he
was
never
less
happy
than
at
present
he
feels
that
he
is
not
what
he
formerly
was
he
seeks
to
regain
his
he
is
dissatisfied
with
himself
and
launches
into
fresh
dissipation
in
order
to
drown
the
recollection
of
the
last
one
new
acquaintance
follows
another
and
each
involves
him
more
deeply
i
know
not
where
this
will
end
we
must
away
there
is
no
other
chance
of
safety
we
must
away
from
venice
but
my
dear
friend
i
have
not
yet
received
a
single
line
from
you
how
am
i
to
interpret
this
long
and
obstinate
silence
letter
iv
baron
von
f
to
count
von
o
june
i
thank
you
my
dear
friend
for
the
token
of
your
remembrance
which
young
b
brought
me
but
what
is
it
you
say
about
letters
i
ought
to
have
received
i
have
received
no
letter
from
you
not
a
single
one
what
a
circuitous
route
must
they
have
taken
in
future
dear
o
when
you
honor
me
with
an
epistle
despatch
it
via
trent
under
cover
to
the
prince
my
master
we
have
at
length
been
compelled
my
dear
friend
to
resort
to
a
measure
which
till
now
we
had
so
happily
avoided
our
remittances
have
failed
to
arrive
failed
for
the
first
time
in
this
pressing
emergency
and
we
have
been
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
a
usurer
as
the
prince
is
willing
to
pay
handsomely
to
keep
the
affair
secret
the
worst
of
this
disagreeable
occurrence
is
that
it
retards
our
departure
on
this
affair
the
prince
and
i
have
had
an
explanation
the
whole
transaction
had
been
arranged
by
biondello
and
the
son
of
israel
was
there
before
i
had
any
suspicion
of
the
fact
it
grieved
me
to
the
heart
to
see
the
prince
reduced
to
such
an
extremity
and
revived
all
my
recollections
of
the
past
and
fears
for
the
future
and
i
suppose
i
may
have
looked
rather
sorrowful
and
gloomy
when
the
usurer
left
the
room
the
prince
whom
the
foregoing
scene
had
left
in
not
the
happiest
frame
of
mind
was
pacing
angrily
up
and
down
the
room
the
rouleaus
of
gold
were
still
lying
on
the
table
i
stood
at
the
window
counting
the
panes
of
glass
in
the
procurator
s
house
opposite
there
was
a
long
pause
at
length
the
prince
broke
silence
f
he
began
i
can
not
bear
to
see
dismal
faces
about
i
remained
silent
why
do
you
not
answer
me
do
i
not
perceive
that
your
heart
is
almost
bursting
to
vent
some
of
its
vexation
i
insist
on
your
speaking
otherwise
you
will
begin
to
fancy
that
you
are
keeping
some
terribly
momentous
if
i
am
gloomy
gracious
sir
replied
i
it
is
only
because
i
do
not
see
you
i
know
continued
he
that
you
have
been
dissatisfied
with
me
for
some
time
past
that
you
disapprove
of
every
step
i
take
that
what
does
count
o
say
in
his
letters
count
o
has
not
written
to
not
written
why
do
you
deny
it
you
keep
up
a
confidential
correspondence
together
you
and
the
count
i
am
quite
aware
of
that
come
you
may
confess
it
for
i
have
no
wish
to
pry
into
your
count
o
replied
i
has
not
yet
answered
any
of
the
three
letters
which
i
have
written
to
i
have
done
wrong
continued
he
don
t
you
think
so
taking
up
one
of
the
rouleaus
i
should
not
have
done
this
i
see
that
it
was
i
ought
not
to
have
reduced
myself
to
such
a
necessity
i
did
not
answer
oh
of
course
i
ought
never
to
have
indulged
my
wishes
but
have
grown
gray
in
the
same
dull
manner
in
which
i
was
brought
up
because
i
once
venture
a
step
beyond
the
drear
monotony
of
my
past
life
and
look
around
me
to
see
whether
there
be
not
some
new
source
of
enjoyment
in
store
for
me
because
i
if
it
was
but
a
trial
gracious
sir
i
have
no
more
to
say
for
the
experience
you
have
gained
would
not
be
dearly
bought
at
three
times
the
price
it
has
cost
it
grieves
me
i
confess
to
think
that
the
opinion
of
the
world
should
be
concerned
in
determining
the
question
how
are
you
to
choose
your
own
it
is
well
for
you
that
you
can
afford
to
despise
the
world
s
opinion
replied
he
i
am
its
creature
i
must
be
its
slave
what
are
we
princes
but
opinion
with
us
it
is
everything
public
opinion
is
our
nurse
and
preceptor
in
infancy
our
oracle
and
idol
in
riper
years
our
staff
in
old
age
take
from
us
what
we
derive
from
the
opinion
of
the
world
and
the
poorest
of
the
humblest
class
is
in
a
better
position
than
we
for
his
fate
has
taught
him
a
lesson
of
philosophy
which
enables
him
to
bear
it
but
a
prince
who
laughs
at
the
world
s
opinion
destroys
himself
like
the
priest
who
denies
the
existence
of
a
and
yet
gracious
prince
i
see
what
you
would
say
i
can
break
through
the
circle
which
my
birth
has
drawn
around
me
but
can
i
also
eradicate
from
my
memory
all
the
false
impressions
which
education
and
early
habit
have
implanted
and
which
a
hundred
thousand
fools
have
been
continually
laboring
to
impress
more
and
more
firmly
everybody
naturally
wishes
to
be
what
he
is
in
perfection
in
short
the
whole
aim
of
a
prince
s
existence
is
to
appear
happy
if
we
can
not
be
happy
after
your
fashion
is
that
any
reason
why
we
should
discard
all
other
means
of
happiness
and
not
be
happy
at
all
if
we
can
not
drink
of
joy
pure
from
the
can
there
be
any
reason
why
we
should
not
beguile
ourselves
with
artificial
pleasure
nay
even
be
content
to
accept
a
sorry
substitute
from
the
very
hand
that
robs
us
of
the
higher
boon
you
were
wont
to
look
for
this
compensation
in
your
own
but
if
i
no
longer
find
it
there
oh
how
came
we
to
fall
on
this
subject
why
did
you
revive
these
recollections
in
me
i
had
recourse
to
this
tumult
of
the
senses
in
order
to
stifle
an
inward
voice
which
embitters
my
whole
life
in
order
to
lull
to
rest
this
inquisitive
reason
which
like
a
sharp
sickle
moves
to
and
fro
in
my
brain
at
each
new
research
lopping
off
another
branch
of
my
my
dearest
prince
he
had
risen
and
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
in
unusual
agitation
i
have
endeavored
dearest
o
to
relate
to
you
this
remarkable
conversation
exactly
as
it
occurred
but
this
i
found
impossible
although
i
sat
down
to
write
it
the
evening
of
the
day
it
took
place
in
order
to
assist
my
memory
i
was
obliged
to
transpose
the
observation
of
the
prince
and
thus
this
compound
of
a
conversation
and
a
philosophical
lecture
which
is
in
some
respects
better
and
in
others
worse
than
the
source
from
which
i
took
it
arose
but
i
assure
you
that
i
have
rather
omitted
some
of
the
prince
s
words
than
ascribed
to
him
any
of
my
own
all
that
is
mine
is
the
arrangement
and
a
few
observations
whose
ownership
you
will
easily
recognize
by
their
note
of
the
baron
von
f
when
everything
gives
way
before
me
and
behind
me
when
the
past
lies
in
the
distance
in
dreary
monotony
like
a
city
of
the
dead
when
the
future
offers
me
naught
when
i
see
my
whole
being
enclosed
within
the
narrow
circle
of
the
present
who
can
blame
me
if
i
clasp
this
niggardly
present
of
time
in
my
arms
with
fiery
eagerness
as
though
it
were
a
friend
whom
i
was
embracing
for
the
last
time
oh
i
have
learnt
to
value
the
present
moment
the
present
moment
is
our
mother
let
us
love
it
as
gracious
sir
you
were
wont
to
believe
in
a
more
lasting
do
but
make
the
enchantment
last
and
fervently
will
i
embrace
it
but
what
pleasure
can
it
give
to
me
to
render
beings
happy
who
will
have
passed
away
like
myself
is
not
everything
passing
away
around
me
each
one
bustles
and
pushes
his
neighbor
aside
hastily
to
catch
a
few
drops
from
the
fountain
of
life
and
then
departs
thirsting
at
this
very
moment
while
i
am
rejoicing
in
lily
strength
some
being
is
waiting
to
start
into
life
at
my
dissolution
show
me
one
being
who
will
endure
and
i
will
become
a
virtuous
but
what
then
has
become
of
those
benevolent
sentiments
which
used
to
be
the
joy
and
the
rule
of
your
life
to
sow
seeds
for
the
future
to
assist
in
carrying
out
the
designs
of
a
high
and
eternal
providence
future
eternal
providence
if
you
take
away
from
man
all
that
he
derives
from
his
own
heart
all
that
he
associates
with
the
idea
of
a
godhead
and
all
that
belongs
to
the
law
of
nature
what
then
do
you
leave
him
what
has
already
happened
to
me
and
what
may
still
follow
i
look
upon
as
two
black
impenetrable
curtains
hanging
over
the
two
extremities
of
human
life
and
which
no
mortal
has
ever
yet
drawn
aside
many
hundred
generations
have
stood
before
the
second
of
these
curtains
casting
the
light
of
their
torches
upon
its
folds
speculating
and
guessing
as
to
what
it
may
conceal
many
have
beheld
themselves
in
the
magnified
image
of
their
passions
reflected
upon
the
curtain
which
hides
futurity
from
their
gaze
and
have
turned
away
shuddering
from
their
own
shadows
poets
philosophers
and
statesmen
have
painted
their
fancies
on
the
curtain
in
brighter
or
more
sombre
colors
according
as
their
own
prospects
were
bright
or
gloomy
many
a
juggler
has
also
taken
advantage
of
the
universal
curiosity
and
by
deceptions
led
astray
the
excited
imagination
a
deep
silence
reigns
behind
this
curtain
no
one
who
passes
beyond
it
answers
any
questions
all
the
reply
is
an
empty
echo
like
the
sound
yielded
by
a
vault
sooner
or
later
all
must
go
behind
this
curtain
and
they
approach
it
with
fear
and
trembling
in
doubt
who
may
be
waiting
there
behind
to
receive
them
sit
id
quod
tanturn
morituri
there
have
been
infidels
who
asserted
that
this
curtain
only
deluded
mankind
and
that
we
saw
nothing
behind
it
because
there
was
nothing
there
to
see
but
to
convince
them
they
were
quickly
sent
behind
it
it
was
indeed
a
rash
conclusion
said
i
if
they
had
no
better
ground
for
it
than
that
they
saw
nothing
you
see
my
dear
friend
i
am
modest
enough
not
to
wish
to
look
behind
this
curtain
and
the
wisest
course
will
doubtless
be
to
abstain
from
all
curiosity
but
while
i
draw
this
impassable
circle
around
me
and
confine
myself
within
the
bounds
of
present
existence
this
small
point
of
time
which
i
was
in
danger
of
neglecting
in
useless
researches
becomes
the
more
important
to
me
what
you
call
the
chief
end
and
aim
of
my
existence
concerns
me
no
longer
i
can
not
escape
my
destiny
i
can
not
promote
its
consummation
but
i
know
and
firmly
believe
that
i
am
here
to
accomplish
some
end
and
that
i
do
accomplish
it
but
the
means
which
nature
has
chosen
to
fulfil
my
destiny
are
so
much
the
more
sacred
to
me
to
me
it
is
everything
my
morality
my
happiness
all
the
rest
i
shall
never
learn
i
am
like
a
messenger
who
carries
a
sealed
letter
to
its
place
of
destination
what
the
letter
contains
is
indifferent
to
him
his
business
is
only
to
earn
his
fee
for
carrying
alas
said
i
how
poor
a
thing
you
would
leave
me
but
in
what
a
labyrinth
have
we
lost
ourselves
exclaimed
the
prince
looking
with
a
smile
at
the
table
on
which
the
rouleaus
lay
after
all
perhaps
not
far
from
the
mark
continued
he
you
will
now
no
doubt
understand
my
reasons
for
this
new
mode
of
life
i
could
not
so
suddenly
tear
myself
away
from
my
fancied
wealth
could
not
so
readily
separate
the
props
of
my
morality
and
happiness
from
the
pleasing
dream
with
which
everything
within
me
was
so
closely
bound
up
i
longed
for
the
frivolity
which
seems
to
render
the
existence
of
most
of
those
about
me
endurable
to
themselves
everything
which
precluded
reflection
was
welcome
to
me
shall
i
confess
it
to
you
i
wished
to
lower
myself
in
order
to
destroy
this
source
of
my
griefs
by
deadening
the
power
of
here
we
were
interrupted
by
a
visit
in
my
next
i
shall
have
to
communicate
to
you
a
piece
of
news
which
from
the
tenor
of
a
conversation
like
the
one
of
you
would
scarcely
have
anticipated
letter
baron
von
f
to
count
von
o
as
the
time
of
our
departure
from
venice
is
now
approaching
with
rapid
steps
this
week
was
to
be
devoted
to
seeing
everything
worthy
of
notice
in
pictures
and
public
edifices
a
task
which
when
one
intends
making
a
long
stay
in
a
place
is
always
delayed
till
the
last
moment
the
marriage
at
cana
by
paul
veronese
which
is
to
be
seen
in
a
benedictine
convent
in
the
island
of
george
was
in
particular
mentioned
to
us
in
high
terms
do
not
expect
me
to
give
you
a
description
of
this
extraordinary
work
of
art
which
on
the
whole
made
a
very
surprising
but
not
equally
pleasing
impression
on
me
we
should
have
required
as
many
hours
as
we
had
minutes
to
study
a
composition
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
figures
upon
a
ground
thirty
feet
broad
what
human
eye
is
capable
of
grasping
so
complicated
a
whole
or
at
once
to
enjoy
all
the
beauty
which
the
artist
has
everywhere
lavished
upon
it
it
is
however
to
be
lamented
that
a
work
of
so
much
merit
which
if
exhibited
in
some
public
place
would
command
the
admiration
of
every
one
should
be
destined
merely
to
ornament
the
refectory
of
a
few
monks
the
church
of
the
monastery
is
no
less
worthy
of
admiration
being
one
of
the
finest
in
the
whole
city
towards
evening
we
went
in
a
gondola
to
the
guidecca
in
order
to
spend
the
pleasant
hours
of
evening
in
its
charming
garden
our
party
which
was
not
very
numerous
soon
dispersed
in
various
directions
and
civitella
who
had
been
waiting
all
day
for
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
me
privately
took
me
aside
into
an
arbor
you
are
a
friend
to
the
prince
he
began
from
whom
he
is
accustomed
to
keep
no
secrets
as
i
know
from
very
good
authority
as
i
entered
his
hotel
i
met
a
man
coming
out
whose
occupation
is
well
known
to
me
and
when
i
entered
the
room
the
prince
s
brow
was
i
wished
to
interrupt
him
you
can
not
deny
it
continued
he
i
knew
the
man
i
looked
at
him
well
and
is
it
possible
that
the
prince
should
have
a
friend
in
venice
a
friend
who
owes
his
life
to
him
and
yet
be
reduced
on
an
emergency
to
make
use
of
such
creatures
tell
me
frankly
baron
is
the
prince
in
difficulties
it
is
in
vain
you
strive
to
conceal
it
from
me
what
you
refuse
to
tell
me
i
can
easily
learn
from
one
who
would
sell
any
secret
for
my
good
marquis
pardon
me
i
must
appear
intrusive
in
order
not
to
be
ungrateful
to
the
prince
i
am
indebted
for
life
and
what
is
still
more
for
a
reasonable
use
of
it
shall
i
stand
idly
by
and
see
him
take
steps
which
besides
being
inconvenient
to
him
are
beneath
his
dignity
shall
i
feel
it
in
my
power
to
assist
him
and
hesitate
for
a
moment
to
step
forward
the
prince
replied
i
is
not
in
difficulties
some
remittances
which
we
expected
via
trent
have
not
yet
arrived
most
likely
either
by
accident
or
because
not
feeling
certain
whether
he
had
not
already
left
venice
they
waited
for
a
communication
from
him
this
has
now
been
done
and
until
their
arrival
civitella
shook
his
head
do
not
mistake
my
motive
said
he
in
this
there
can
be
no
question
as
to
diminishing
the
extent
of
my
obligations
towards
the
prince
which
all
my
uncle
s
wealth
would
be
insufficient
to
cancel
my
object
is
simply
to
spare
him
a
few
unpleasant
moments
my
uncle
possesses
a
large
fortune
which
i
can
command
as
freely
as
though
it
were
my
own
a
fortunate
circumstance
occurs
which
enables
me
to
avail
myself
of
the
only
means
by
which
i
can
possibly
be
of
the
slightest
use
to
your
master
i
know
continued
he
how
much
delicacy
the
prince
possesses
but
the
feeling
is
mutual
and
it
would
be
noble
on
his
part
to
afford
me
this
slight
gratification
were
it
only
to
make
me
appear
to
feel
less
heavily
the
load
of
obligation
under
which
i
he
continued
to
urge
his
request
until
i
had
pledged
my
word
to
assist
him
to
the
utmost
of
my
ability
i
knew
the
prince
s
character
and
had
but
small
hopes
of
success
the
marquis
promised
to
agree
to
any
conditions
the
prince
might
impose
but
added
that
it
would
deeply
wound
him
to
be
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
stranger
in
the
heat
of
our
conversation
we
had
strayed
far
away
from
the
rest
of
the
company
and
were
returning
when
z
came
to
meet
us
i
am
in
search
of
the
prince
he
cried
is
he
not
with
you
we
were
just
going
to
him
was
our
reply
we
thought
to
find
him
with
the
rest
of
the
the
company
is
all
together
but
he
is
nowhere
to
be
found
i
can
not
imagine
how
we
lost
sight
of
it
now
occurred
to
civitella
that
he
might
have
gone
to
look
at
the
adjoining
church
which
had
a
short
time
before
attracted
his
attention
we
immediately
went
to
look
for
him
there
as
we
approached
we
found
biondello
waiting
in
the
porch
on
coming
nearer
we
saw
the
prince
emerge
hastily
from
a
side
door
his
countenance
was
flushed
and
he
looked
anxiously
round
for
biondello
whom
he
called
he
seemed
to
be
giving
him
very
particular
instructions
for
the
execution
of
some
commission
while
his
eyes
continued
constantly
fixed
on
the
church
door
which
had
remained
open
biondello
hastened
into
the
church
the
prince
without
perceiving
us
passed
through
the
crowd
and
went
back
to
his
party
which
he
reached
before
us
we
resolved
to
sup
in
an
open
pavilion
of
the
garden
where
the
marquis
had
without
our
knowledge
arranged
a
little
concert
which
was
quite
there
was
a
young
singer
in
particular
whose
delicious
voice
and
charming
figure
excited
general
admiration
nothing
however
seemed
to
make
an
impression
on
the
prince
he
spoke
little
and
gave
confused
answers
to
our
questions
his
eyes
were
anxiously
fixed
in
the
direction
whence
he
expected
biondello
and
he
seemed
much
agitated
civitella
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
the
church
he
was
unable
to
give
any
description
of
it
some
beautiful
pictures
which
rendered
the
church
remarkable
were
spoken
of
the
prince
had
not
noticed
them
we
perceived
that
our
questions
annoyed
him
and
therefore
discontinued
them
hour
after
hour
rolled
on
and
still
biondello
returned
not
the
prince
could
no
longer
conceal
his
impatience
he
rose
from
the
table
and
paced
alone
with
rapid
strides
up
and
down
a
retired
walk
nobody
could
imagine
what
had
happened
to
him
i
did
not
venture
to
ask
him
the
reason
of
so
remarkable
a
change
in
his
demeanor
i
have
for
some
time
past
resigned
my
former
place
in
his
confidence
it
was
therefore
with
the
utmost
impatience
that
i
awaited
the
return
of
biondello
to
explain
this
riddle
to
me
it
was
past
ten
o
clock
when
he
made
his
appearance
the
tidings
he
brought
did
not
make
the
prince
more
communicative
he
returned
in
an
to
the
company
the
gondola
was
ordered
and
we
returned
home
during
the
remainder
of
that
evening
i
could
find
no
opportunity
of
speaking
to
biondello
and
was
therefore
obliged
to
retire
to
my
pillow
with
my
curiosity
unsatisfied
the
prince
had
dismissed
us
early
but
a
thousand
reflections
flitted
across
my
brain
and
kept
me
awake
for
a
long
time
i
could
hear
him
pacing
up
and
down
his
room
at
length
sleep
overcame
me
late
at
midnight
i
was
awakened
by
a
voice
and
i
felt
a
hand
passed
across
my
face
i
opened
my
eyes
and
saw
the
prince
standing
at
my
bedside
with
a
lamp
in
his
hand
he
told
me
he
was
unable
to
sleep
and
begged
me
to
keep
him
company
through
the
night
i
was
going
to
dress
myself
but
he
told
me
to
stay
where
i
was
and
seated
himself
at
my
bedside
something
has
happened
to
me
he
began
the
impression
of
which
will
never
be
effaced
from
my
soul
i
left
you
as
you
know
to
see
the
church
respecting
which
civitella
had
raised
my
curiosity
and
which
had
already
attracted
my
attention
as
neither
you
nor
he
were
at
hand
i
walked
the
short
distance
alone
and
ordered
biondello
to
wait
for
me
at
the
door
the
church
was
quite
empty
a
dim
and
solemn
light
surrounded
me
as
i
entered
from
the
blazing
sultry
day
without
i
stood
alone
in
the
spacious
building
throughout
which
there
reigned
the
stillness
of
the
grave
i
placed
myself
in
the
centre
of
the
church
and
gave
myself
up
to
the
feelings
which
the
sight
was
calculated
to
produce
by
degrees
the
grand
proportions
of
this
majestic
building
expanded
to
my
gaze
and
i
stood
wrapt
in
deep
and
pleasing
contemplation
above
me
the
evening
bell
was
tolling
its
tones
died
softly
away
in
the
aisles
and
found
an
echo
in
my
heart
some
at
a
distance
attracted
my
attention
i
approached
to
look
at
them
unconsciously
i
had
wandered
through
one
side
of
the
church
and
was
now
standing
at
the
opposite
end
here
a
few
steps
raised
round
a
pillar
led
into
a
little
chapel
containing
several
small
altars
with
statues
of
saints
in
the
niches
above
them
on
entering
the
chapel
on
the
right
i
heard
a
whispering
as
though
some
one
near
was
speaking
in
a
low
voice
i
turned
towards
the
spot
whence
the
sound
proceeded
and
saw
before
me
a
female
form
no
i
can
not
describe
to
you
the
beauty
of
this
form
my
first
feeling
was
one
of
awe
which
however
soon
gave
place
to
ravishing
but
this
figure
your
highness
are
you
certain
that
it
was
something
living
something
real
and
not
perhaps
a
picture
or
an
illusion
of
your
fancy
hear
me
further
it
was
a
lady
surely
till
that
moment
i
have
never
seen
her
sex
in
its
full
perfection
all
around
was
sombre
the
setting
sun
shone
through
a
single
window
into
the
chapel
and
its
rays
rested
upon
her
figure
with
inexpressible
grace
half
kneeling
half
lying
she
was
stretched
before
an
altar
one
of
the
most
striking
most
lovely
and
picturesque
objects
in
all
nature
her
dress
was
of
black
moreen
fitting
tightly
to
her
slender
waist
and
arms
the
skirts
spreading
around
her
like
a
spanish
robe
her
long
hair
was
divided
into
two
broad
plaits
which
apparently
from
their
own
weight
had
escaped
from
under
her
veil
and
flowed
in
charming
disorder
down
her
back
one
of
her
hands
grasped
the
crucifix
and
her
head
rested
gracefully
upon
the
other
but
where
shall
i
find
words
to
describe
to
you
the
angelic
beauty
of
her
countenance
in
which
the
charms
of
a
seraph
seemed
displayed
the
setting
sun
shone
full
upon
her
face
and
its
golden
beams
seemed
to
surround
it
as
with
a
glory
can
you
recall
to
your
mind
the
madonna
of
our
florentine
painter
she
was
here
personified
even
to
those
few
deviations
from
the
studied
costume
which
so
powerfully
so
irresistibly
attracted
me
in
the
with
regard
to
the
madonna
of
whom
the
prince
spoke
the
case
is
this
shortly
after
your
departure
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
florentine
painter
who
had
been
summoned
to
venice
to
paint
an
for
some
church
the
name
of
which
i
do
not
recollect
he
had
brought
with
him
three
paintings
which
had
been
intended
for
the
gallery
in
the
cornari
palace
they
consisted
of
a
madonna
a
heloise
and
a
venus
very
lightly
apparelled
all
three
were
of
great
beauty
and
although
the
subjects
were
quite
different
they
were
so
intrinsically
equal
that
it
seemed
almost
impossible
to
determine
which
to
prefer
the
prince
alone
did
not
hesitate
for
a
moment
as
soon
as
the
pictures
were
placed
before
him
the
madonna
absorbed
his
whole
attention
in
the
two
others
he
admired
the
painter
s
genius
but
in
this
he
forgot
the
artist
and
his
art
his
whole
soul
being
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
the
work
he
was
quite
moved
and
could
scarcely
tear
himself
away
from
it
we
could
easily
see
by
the
artist
s
countenance
that
in
his
heart
he
coincided
with
the
prince
s
judgment
he
obstinately
refused
to
separate
the
pictures
and
demanded
fifteen
hundred
zechins
for
the
three
the
prince
offered
him
half
that
sum
for
the
madonna
alone
but
in
vain
the
artist
insisted
on
his
first
demand
and
who
knows
what
might
have
been
the
result
if
a
ready
purchaser
had
not
stepped
forward
two
hours
afterwards
all
three
pictures
were
sold
and
we
never
saw
them
again
it
was
this
madonna
which
now
recurred
to
the
prince
s
mind
i
stood
continued
he
gazing
at
her
in
silent
admiration
she
did
not
observe
me
my
arrival
did
not
disturb
her
so
completely
was
she
absorbed
in
her
devotion
she
prayed
to
her
deity
and
i
prayed
to
her
yes
i
adored
her
all
the
pictures
of
saints
all
the
altars
and
the
burning
tapers
around
me
had
failed
to
remind
me
of
what
now
for
the
first
time
burst
upon
me
that
i
was
in
a
sacred
place
shall
i
confess
it
to
you
in
that
moment
i
believed
firmly
in
him
whose
image
was
clasped
in
her
beautiful
hand
i
read
in
her
eyes
that
he
answered
her
prayers
thanks
be
to
her
charming
devotion
it
had
revealed
him
to
me
i
wandered
with
her
through
all
the
paradise
of
prayer
she
rose
and
i
recollected
myself
i
stepped
aside
confused
but
the
noise
i
made
in
moving
discovered
me
i
thought
that
the
unexpected
presence
of
a
man
might
alarm
that
my
boldness
would
offend
her
but
neither
of
these
feelings
were
expressed
in
the
look
with
which
she
regarded
me
peace
benign
peace
was
portrayed
in
her
countenance
and
a
cheerful
smile
played
upon
her
lips
she
was
descending
from
her
heaven
and
i
was
the
first
happy
mortal
who
met
her
benevolent
look
her
mind
was
still
wrapt
in
her
concluding
prayer
she
had
not
yet
come
in
contact
with
earth
i
now
heard
something
stir
in
the
opposite
corner
of
the
chapel
it
was
an
elderly
lady
who
rose
from
a
cushion
close
behind
me
till
now
i
had
not
observed
her
she
had
been
distant
only
a
few
steps
from
me
and
must
have
seen
my
every
motion
this
confused
me
i
cast
my
eyes
to
the
earth
and
both
the
ladies
passed
by
on
this
last
point
i
thought
myself
able
to
console
the
prince
strange
continued
he
after
a
long
silence
that
there
should
be
something
which
one
has
never
known
never
missed
and
that
yet
on
a
sudden
one
should
seem
to
live
and
breathe
for
that
alone
can
one
single
moment
so
completely
metamorphose
a
human
being
it
would
now
be
as
impossible
for
me
to
indulge
in
the
wishes
or
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
yesterday
as
it
would
be
to
return
to
the
toys
of
my
childhood
and
all
this
since
i
have
seen
this
object
which
lives
and
rules
in
the
inmost
recesses
of
my
soul
it
seems
to
say
that
i
can
love
nothing
else
and
that
nothing
else
in
this
world
can
produce
an
impression
on
but
consider
gracious
prince
said
i
the
excitable
mood
you
were
in
when
this
apparition
surprised
you
and
how
all
the
circumstances
conspired
to
inflame
your
imagination
quitting
the
dazzling
light
of
day
and
the
busy
throng
of
men
you
were
suddenly
surrounded
by
twilight
and
repose
you
confess
that
you
had
quite
given
yourself
up
to
those
solemn
emotions
which
the
majesty
of
the
place
was
calculated
to
awaken
the
contemplation
of
fine
works
of
art
had
rendered
you
more
susceptible
to
the
impressions
of
beauty
in
any
form
you
supposed
yourself
alone
when
you
saw
a
maiden
who
i
will
readily
allow
may
have
been
very
beautiful
and
whose
charms
were
heightened
by
a
favorable
illumination
of
the
setting
sun
a
graceful
attitude
and
an
expression
of
fervent
devotion
what
is
more
natural
than
that
your
vivid
fancy
should
look
upon
such
a
form
as
something
supernaturally
perfect
can
the
imagination
give
what
it
never
received
replied
he
in
the
whole
range
of
my
fancy
there
is
nothing
which
i
can
compare
with
that
image
it
is
impressed
on
my
mind
distinctly
and
vividly
as
in
the
moment
when
i
beheld
it
i
can
think
of
nothing
but
that
picture
but
you
might
offer
me
whole
worlds
for
it
in
my
gracious
prince
this
is
must
the
sensation
which
makes
me
happy
necessarily
have
a
name
love
do
not
degrade
my
feeling
by
giving
it
a
name
which
is
so
often
misapplied
by
the
who
ever
felt
before
what
i
do
now
such
a
being
never
before
existed
how
then
can
the
name
be
admitted
before
the
emotion
which
it
is
meant
to
express
mine
is
a
novel
and
peculiar
feeling
connected
only
with
this
being
and
capable
of
being
applied
to
her
alone
love
from
love
i
am
secure
you
sent
away
biondello
no
doubt
to
follow
in
the
steps
of
these
strangers
and
to
make
inquiries
concerning
them
what
news
did
he
bring
you
biondello
discovered
nothing
or
at
least
as
good
as
nothing
an
aged
respectably
dressed
man
who
looked
more
like
a
citizen
than
a
servant
came
to
conduct
them
to
their
gondola
a
number
of
poor
people
placed
themselves
in
a
row
and
quitted
her
apparently
well
satisfied
biondello
said
he
saw
one
of
her
hands
which
was
ornamented
with
several
precious
stones
she
spoke
a
few
words
which
biondello
could
not
comprehend
to
her
companion
he
says
it
was
greek
as
she
had
some
distance
to
walk
to
the
canal
the
people
began
to
throng
together
attracted
by
the
strangeness
of
her
appearance
nobody
knew
her
but
beauty
seems
born
to
rule
all
made
way
for
her
in
a
respectful
manner
she
let
fall
a
black
veil
that
covered
half
of
her
person
over
her
face
and
hastened
into
the
gondola
along
the
whole
giudecca
biondello
managed
to
keep
the
boat
in
view
but
the
crowd
prevented
his
following
it
but
surely
he
took
notice
of
the
gondolier
so
as
to
be
able
to
recognize
him
he
has
undertaken
to
find
out
the
gondolier
but
he
is
not
one
of
those
with
whom
he
associates
the
mendicants
whom
he
questioned
could
give
him
no
further
information
than
that
the
signora
had
come
to
the
church
for
the
last
few
saturdays
and
had
each
time
divided
a
among
them
it
was
a
dutch
ducat
which
biondello
changed
for
them
and
brought
to
it
appears
then
that
she
is
a
greek
most
likely
of
rank
at
any
rate
rich
and
charitable
that
is
as
much
as
we
dare
venture
to
conclude
at
present
gracious
sir
perhaps
too
much
but
a
greek
lady
in
a
catholic
church
why
not
she
may
have
changed
her
religion
but
there
is
certainly
some
mystery
in
the
affair
why
should
she
go
only
once
a
week
why
always
on
saturday
on
which
day
as
biondello
tells
me
the
church
is
generally
deserted
next
saturday
at
the
latest
must
decide
this
question
till
then
dearest
friend
you
must
help
me
to
while
away
the
hours
but
it
is
in
vain
they
will
go
their
lingering
pace
though
my
soul
is
burning
with
expectation
and
when
this
day
at
length
arrives
what
then
gracious
prince
what
do
you
purpose
doing
what
do
i
purpose
doing
i
shall
see
her
i
will
discover
where
she
lives
and
who
she
is
but
to
what
does
all
this
tend
i
hear
you
ask
what
i
saw
made
me
happy
i
therefore
now
know
wherein
my
happiness
consists
and
our
departure
from
venice
which
is
fixed
for
next
monday
how
could
i
know
that
venice
still
contained
such
a
treasure
for
me
you
ask
me
questions
of
my
past
life
i
tell
you
that
from
this
day
forward
i
will
begin
a
new
i
thought
that
now
was
the
opportunity
to
keep
my
word
to
the
marquis
i
explained
to
the
prince
that
a
protracted
stay
in
venice
was
altogether
incompatible
with
the
exhausted
state
of
his
finances
and
that
if
he
extended
his
sojourn
here
beyond
the
appointed
time
he
could
not
reckon
on
receiving
funds
from
his
court
on
this
occasion
i
learned
what
had
hitherto
been
a
secret
to
me
namely
that
the
prince
had
without
the
knowledge
of
his
other
brothers
received
from
his
sister
the
reigning
of
considerable
loans
which
she
would
gladly
double
if
his
court
left
him
in
the
lurch
this
sister
who
as
you
know
is
a
pious
enthusiast
thinks
that
the
large
savings
which
she
makes
at
a
very
economical
court
can
not
be
deposited
in
better
hands
than
in
those
of
a
brother
whose
wise
benevolence
she
well
knows
and
whose
character
she
warmly
honors
i
have
indeed
known
for
some
time
that
a
very
close
intercourse
has
been
kept
up
between
the
two
and
that
many
letters
have
been
exchanged
but
as
the
prince
s
own
resources
have
hitherto
always
been
sufficient
to
cover
his
expenditure
i
had
never
guessed
at
this
hidden
channel
it
is
clear
therefore
that
the
prince
must
have
had
some
expenses
which
have
been
and
still
are
unknown
to
me
but
if
i
can
judge
of
them
by
his
general
character
they
will
certainly
not
be
of
such
a
description
as
to
tend
to
his
disgrace
and
yet
i
thought
i
understood
him
thoroughly
after
this
disclosure
i
of
course
did
not
hesitate
to
make
known
to
him
the
marquis
offer
which
to
my
no
small
surprise
he
immediately
accepted
he
gave
me
the
authority
to
transact
the
business
with
the
marquis
in
whatever
way
i
thought
most
advisable
and
then
immediately
to
settle
the
account
with
the
usurer
to
his
sister
he
proposed
to
write
without
delay
it
was
morning
when
we
separated
however
disagreeable
this
affair
is
to
me
for
more
than
one
reason
the
worst
of
it
is
that
it
seems
to
threaten
a
longer
residence
in
venice
from
the
prince
s
passion
i
rather
augur
good
than
evil
it
is
perhaps
the
most
powerful
method
of
withdrawing
him
from
his
metaphysical
dreams
to
the
concerns
and
feelings
of
real
life
it
will
have
its
crisis
and
like
an
illness
produced
by
artificial
means
will
eradicate
the
natural
disorder
farewell
my
dear
friend
i
have
written
down
these
incidents
immediately
upon
their
occurrence
the
post
starts
immediately
you
will
receive
this
letter
on
the
same
day
as
my
last
letter
vi
baron
f
to
count
o
june
this
civitella
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
obliging
personages
in
the
world
the
prince
had
scarcely
left
me
the
other
day
before
i
received
a
note
from
the
marquis
enforcing
his
former
offers
with
renewed
earnestness
i
instantly
forwarded
in
the
prince
s
name
a
bond
for
six
thousand
zechins
in
less
than
half
an
hour
it
was
returned
with
double
the
sum
required
in
notes
and
gold
the
prince
at
length
assented
to
this
increase
but
insisted
that
the
bond
which
was
drawn
only
for
six
weeks
should
be
accepted
the
whole
of
the
present
week
has
been
consumed
in
inquiries
after
the
mysterious
greek
biondello
set
all
his
engines
to
work
but
until
now
in
vain
he
certainly
discovered
the
gondolier
but
from
him
he
could
learn
nothing
save
that
the
ladies
had
disembarked
on
the
island
of
murano
where
they
entered
two
sedan
chairs
which
were
waiting
for
them
he
supposed
them
to
be
english
because
they
spoke
a
foreign
language
and
had
paid
him
in
gold
he
did
not
even
know
their
guide
but
believed
him
to
be
a
glass
manufacturer
from
murano
we
were
now
at
least
certain
that
we
must
not
look
for
her
in
the
giudecca
and
that
in
all
probability
she
lived
in
the
island
of
murano
but
unluckily
the
description
the
prince
gave
of
her
was
not
such
as
to
make
her
recognizable
by
a
third
party
the
passionate
interest
with
which
he
had
regarded
her
had
hindered
him
from
observing
her
minutely
for
all
the
minor
details
which
other
people
would
not
have
failed
to
notice
had
escaped
his
observation
from
his
description
one
would
have
sooner
expected
to
find
her
prototype
in
the
works
of
ariosto
or
tasso
than
on
a
venetian
island
besides
our
inquiries
had
to
be
conducted
with
the
utmost
caution
in
order
not
to
become
prejudicial
to
the
lady
or
to
excite
undue
attention
as
biondello
was
the
only
man
besides
the
prince
who
had
seen
her
even
through
her
veil
and
could
therefore
recognize
her
he
strove
to
be
as
much
as
possible
in
all
the
places
where
she
was
likely
to
appear
the
life
of
the
poor
man
during
the
whole
week
was
a
continual
race
through
all
the
streets
of
venice
in
the
greek
church
particularly
every
inquiry
was
made
but
always
with
the
same
and
the
prince
whose
impatience
increased
with
every
successive
failure
was
at
last
obliged
to
wait
till
saturday
with
what
patience
he
might
his
restlessness
was
excessive
nothing
interested
him
nothing
could
fix
his
attention
he
was
in
constant
feverish
excitement
he
fled
from
society
but
the
evil
increased
in
solitude
he
had
never
been
so
much
besieged
by
visitors
as
in
this
week
his
approaching
departure
had
been
announced
and
everybody
crowded
to
see
him
it
was
necessary
to
occupy
the
attention
of
the
people
in
order
to
lull
their
suspicions
and
to
amuse
the
prince
with
the
view
of
diverting
his
mind
from
its
object
in
this
emergency
civitella
hit
upon
play
and
for
the
purpose
of
driving
away
most
of
the
visitors
proposed
that
the
stakes
should
be
high
he
hoped
by
awakening
in
the
prince
a
transient
liking
for
play
from
which
it
would
afterwards
be
easy
to
wean
him
to
destroy
the
romantic
bent
of
his
passion
the
cards
said
civitella
have
saved
me
from
many
a
folly
which
i
had
intended
to
commit
and
repaired
many
which
i
had
already
perpetrated
at
the
faro
table
i
have
often
recovered
my
tranquillity
of
mind
of
which
a
pair
of
bright
eyes
had
robbed
me
and
women
never
had
more
power
over
me
than
when
i
had
not
money
enough
to
i
will
not
enter
into
a
discussion
as
to
how
far
civitella
was
right
but
the
remedy
we
had
hit
upon
soon
began
to
be
worse
than
the
disease
it
was
intended
to
cure
the
prince
who
could
only
make
the
game
at
all
interesting
to
himself
by
staking
extremely
high
soon
overstepped
all
bounds
he
was
quite
out
of
his
element
everything
he
did
seemed
to
be
done
in
a
passion
all
his
actions
betrayed
the
uneasiness
of
his
mind
you
know
his
general
indifference
to
money
he
seemed
now
to
have
become
totally
insensible
to
its
value
gold
flowed
through
his
hands
like
water
as
he
played
without
the
slightest
caution
he
lost
almost
invariably
he
lost
immense
sums
for
he
staked
like
a
desperate
gamester
dearest
o
with
an
aching
heart
i
write
it
in
four
days
he
had
lost
above
twelve
thousand
zechins
do
not
reproach
me
i
blame
myself
sufficiently
but
how
could
i
prevent
it
could
i
do
more
than
warn
him
i
did
all
that
was
in
my
power
and
can
not
find
myself
guilty
civitella
too
lost
not
a
little
i
won
about
six
hundred
zechins
the
unprecedented
of
the
prince
excited
general
attention
and
therefore
he
would
not
leave
off
playing
civitella
who
is
always
ready
to
oblige
him
immediately
advanced
him
the
required
sum
the
deficit
is
made
up
but
the
prince
owes
the
marquis
thousand
zechins
oh
how
i
long
for
the
savings
of
his
pious
sister
are
all
sovereigns
so
my
dear
friend
the
prince
behaves
as
though
he
had
done
the
marquis
a
great
honor
and
he
at
any
rate
plays
his
part
well
civitella
sought
to
quiet
me
by
saying
that
this
recklessness
this
extraordinary
would
be
most
effectual
in
bringing
the
prince
to
his
senses
the
money
he
said
was
of
no
consequence
he
himself
would
not
feel
the
loss
in
the
least
and
would
be
happy
to
serve
the
prince
at
any
moment
with
three
times
the
amount
the
cardinal
also
assured
me
that
his
nephew
s
intentions
were
honest
and
that
he
should
be
ready
to
assist
him
in
carrying
them
out
the
most
unfortunate
thing
was
that
these
tremendous
sacrifices
did
not
even
effect
their
object
one
would
have
thought
that
the
prince
would
at
least
feel
some
interest
in
his
play
but
such
was
not
the
case
his
thoughts
were
wandering
far
away
and
the
passion
which
we
wished
to
stifle
by
his
in
play
seemed
on
the
contrary
only
to
gather
strength
when
for
instance
a
decisive
stroke
was
about
to
be
played
and
every
one
s
eyes
were
fixed
full
of
expectation
on
the
board
his
were
searching
for
biondello
in
order
to
catch
the
news
he
might
have
brought
him
from
the
expression
of
his
countenance
biondello
brought
no
tidings
and
his
master
s
losses
continued
the
gains
however
fell
into
very
needy
hands
a
few
your
excellencies
whom
scandal
reports
to
be
in
the
habit
of
carrying
home
their
frugal
dinner
from
the
market
in
their
senatorial
caps
entered
our
house
as
beggars
and
left
it
with
purses
civitella
pointed
them
out
to
me
look
said
he
how
many
poor
devils
make
their
fortunes
by
one
great
man
taking
a
whim
into
his
head
this
is
what
i
like
to
see
it
is
princely
and
royal
a
great
man
must
even
by
his
failings
make
some
one
happy
like
a
river
which
by
its
overflowing
fertilizes
the
neighboring
civitella
has
a
noble
and
generous
way
of
thinking
but
the
prince
owes
him
thousand
zechins
at
length
the
saturday
arrived
and
my
master
insisted
upon
going
directly
after
dinner
to
the
church
he
stationed
himself
in
the
chapel
where
he
had
first
seen
the
unknown
but
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
be
immediately
observed
biondello
had
orders
to
keep
watch
at
the
church
door
and
to
enter
into
conversation
with
the
attendant
of
the
ladies
i
had
taken
upon
myself
to
enter
like
a
chance
passenger
into
the
same
gondola
with
them
on
their
return
in
order
to
follow
their
track
if
the
other
schemes
should
fail
at
the
spot
where
the
gondolier
said
he
had
landed
them
the
last
time
two
sedans
were
stationed
the
chamberlain
z
was
ordered
to
follow
in
a
separate
gondola
in
order
to
trace
the
retreat
of
the
unknown
if
all
else
should
fail
the
prince
wished
to
give
himself
wholly
up
to
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
and
if
possible
try
to
make
her
acquaintance
in
the
church
civitella
was
to
keep
out
of
the
way
altogether
as
his
reputation
among
the
women
of
venice
was
so
bad
that
his
presence
could
not
have
failed
to
excite
the
suspicions
of
the
lady
you
see
dear
count
it
was
not
through
any
want
of
precaution
on
our
part
that
the
fair
unknown
escaped
us
never
perhaps
was
there
offered
up
in
any
church
such
ardent
prayers
for
success
and
never
were
hopes
so
cruelly
disappointed
the
prince
waited
till
after
sunset
starting
in
expectation
at
every
sound
which
approached
the
chapel
and
at
every
creaking
of
the
church
door
seven
full
hours
passed
and
no
greek
lady
i
need
not
describe
his
state
of
mind
you
know
what
hope
deferred
is
hope
which
one
has
nourished
unceasingly
for
seven
days

nights
letter
vii
baron
von
f
to
count
von
o
july
the
mysterious
unknown
of
the
prince
reminded
marquis
civitella
of
a
romantic
incident
which
happened
to
himself
a
short
time
since
and
to
divert
the
prince
he
offered
to
relate
it
i
will
give
it
you
in
his
own
words
but
the
lively
spirit
which
he
infuses
into
all
he
tells
will
be
lost
in
my
narration
here
follows
the
subjoined
fragment
which
appeared
in
the
eighth
part
of
the
thalia
and
was
originally
intended
for
the
second
volume
of
the
it
found
a
place
here
after
schiller
had
given
up
the
idea
of
completing
the
in
the
spring
of
last
year
began
civitella
i
had
the
misfortune
to
embroil
myself
with
the
spanish
ambassador
a
gentleman
who
in
his
seventieth
year
had
been
guilty
of
the
folly
of
wishing
to
marry
a
roman
girl
of
eighteen
his
vengeance
pursued
me
and
my
friends
advised
me
to
secure
my
safety
by
a
timely
flight
and
to
keep
out
of
the
way
until
the
hand
of
nature
or
an
adjustment
of
differences
had
secured
me
from
the
wrath
of
this
formidable
enemy
as
i
felt
it
too
severe
a
punishment
to
quit
venice
altogether
i
took
up
my
abode
in
a
distant
quarter
of
the
town
where
i
lived
in
a
lonely
house
under
a
feigned
name
keeping
myself
concealed
by
day
and
devoting
the
night
to
the
society
of
my
friends
and
of
pleasure
my
windows
looked
upon
a
garden
the
west
side
of
which
was
bounded
by
the
walls
of
a
convent
while
towards
the
east
it
jutted
out
into
the
laguna
in
the
form
of
a
little
peninsula
the
garden
was
charmingly
situated
but
little
frequented
it
was
my
custom
every
morning
after
my
friends
had
left
me
to
spend
a
few
moments
at
the
window
before
retiring
to
rest
to
see
the
sun
rise
over
the
adriatic
and
then
to
bid
him
goodnight
if
you
my
dear
prince
have
not
yet
enjoyed
this
pleasure
i
recommend
exactly
this
station
the
only
eligible
one
perhaps
in
all
venice
to
enjoy
so
splendid
a
prospect
in
perfection
a
purple
twilight
hangs
over
the
deep
and
a
golden
mist
on
the
laguna
announces
the
sun
s
approach
the
heavens
and
the
sea
are
wrapped
in
expectant
silence
in
two
seconds
the
orb
of
day
appears
casting
a
flood
of
fiery
light
on
the
waves
it
is
an
enchanting
sight
one
morning
when
i
was
according
to
custom
enjoying
the
beauty
of
this
prospect
i
suddenly
discovered
that
i
was
not
the
only
spectator
of
the
scene
i
fancied
i
heard
voices
in
the
garden
and
turning
to
the
quarter
whence
the
sound
proceeded
i
perceived
a
gondola
steering
for
the
land
in
a
few
moments
i
saw
figures
walking
at
a
slow
pace
up
the
avenue
they
were
a
man
and
a
woman
accompanied
by
a
little
negro
the
female
was
clothed
in
white
and
had
a
brilliant
on
her
finger
it
was
not
light
enough
to
perceive
more
my
curiosity
was
raised
doubtless
a
rendezvous
of
a
pair
of
lovers
but
in
such
a
place
and
at
so
unusual
an
hour
it
was
scarcely
three
o
clock
and
everything
was
still
veiled
in
dusky
twilight
the
incident
seemed
to
me
novel
and
proper
for
a
romance
and
i
waited
to
see
the
end
i
soon
lost
sight
of
them
among
the
foliage
of
the
garden
and
some
time
elapsed
before
they
again
emerged
to
view
meanwhile
a
delightful
song
was
heard
it
proceeded
from
the
gondolier
who
was
in
this
manner
shortening
the
time
and
was
answered
by
a
comrade
a
short
way
off
they
sang
stanzas
from
tasso
time
and
place
were
in
unison
and
the
melody
sounded
sweetly
in
the
profound
silence
around
day
in
the
meantime
had
dawned
and
objects
were
discerned
more
plainly
i
sought
my
people
whom
i
found
walking
up
a
broad
walk
often
standing
still
but
always
with
their
backs
turned
towards
me
and
proceeding
further
from
my
residence
their
noble
easy
carriage
convinced
me
at
once
that
they
were
people
of
rank
and
the
splendid
figure
of
the
lady
made
me
augur
as
much
of
her
beauty
they
appeared
to
converse
but
little
the
lady
however
more
than
her
companion
in
the
spectacle
of
the
rising
sun
which
now
burst
out
in
all
its
splendor
they
seemed
to
take
not
the
slightest
interest
while
i
was
employed
in
adjusting
my
glass
in
order
to
bring
them
into
view
as
closely
as
possible
they
suddenly
disappeared
down
a
side
path
and
some
time
elapsed
before
i
regained
sight
of
them
the
sun
had
now
fully
risen
they
were
approaching
straight
towards
me
with
their
eyes
fixed
upon
where
i
stood
what
a
heavenly
form
did
i
behold
was
it
illusion
or
the
magic
effect
of
the
beautiful
light
i
thought
i
beheld
a
supernatural
being
for
my
eyes
quailed
before
the
angelic
brightness
of
her
look
so
much
loveliness
combined
with
so
much
dignity
so
much
mind
and
so
much
blooming
youth
it
is
in
vain
i
attempt
to
describe
it
i
had
never
seen
true
beauty
till
that
moment
in
the
heat
of
conversation
they
lingered
near
me
and
i
had
full
opportunity
to
contemplate
her
scarcely
however
had
i
cast
my
eyes
upon
her
companion
but
even
her
beauty
was
not
powerful
enough
to
fix
my
attention
he
appeared
to
be
a
man
still
in
the
prime
of
life
rather
slight
and
of
a
tall
noble
figure
never
have
i
beheld
so
much
mind
so
much
noble
expression
in
a
human
countenance
though
perfectly
secured
from
observation
i
was
unable
to
meet
the
lightning
glance
that
shot
from
beneath
his
dark
eyebrows
there
was
a
moving
expression
of
sorrow
about
his
eyes
but
an
expression
of
benevolence
about
the
mouth
which
relieved
the
settled
gravity
spread
over
his
whole
countenance
a
certain
cast
of
features
not
quite
european
together
with
his
dress
which
appeared
to
have
been
chosen
with
inimitable
good
taste
from
the
most
varied
costumes
gave
him
a
peculiar
air
which
not
a
little
heightened
the
impression
produced
by
his
appearance
a
degree
of
wildness
in
his
looks
warranted
the
supposition
that
he
was
an
enthusiast
but
his
deportment
and
carriage
showed
that
his
character
had
been
formed
by
mixing
in
z
who
you
know
must
always
give
utterance
to
what
he
thinks
could
contain
himself
no
longer
our
armenian
cried
he
our
very
armenian
and
nobody
what
armenian
if
one
may
ask
inquired
civitella
has
no
one
told
you
of
the
farce
replied
the
prince
but
no
interruption
i
begin
to
feel
interested
in
your
hero
pray
continue
your
there
was
something
inexplicable
in
his
whole
demeanor
continued
civitella
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
his
companion
with
an
expression
of
anxiety
and
passion
but
the
moment
they
met
hers
he
looked
down
abashed
is
the
man
beside
himself
thought
i
could
stand
for
ages
and
gaze
at
nothing
else
but
her
the
foliage
again
concealed
them
from
my
sight
long
long
did
i
look
for
their
reappearance
but
in
vain
at
length
i
caught
sight
of
them
from
another
window
they
were
standing
before
the
basin
of
a
fountain
at
some
distance
apart
and
both
wrapped
in
deep
silence
they
had
probably
remained
some
time
in
the
same
position
her
clear
and
intelligent
eyes
were
resting
inquiringly
on
his
and
seemed
as
if
they
would
imbibe
every
thought
from
him
as
it
revealed
itself
in
his
countenance
he
as
if
he
wanted
courage
to
look
directly
into
her
face
furtively
sought
its
reflection
in
the
watery
mirror
before
him
or
gazed
steadfastly
at
the
dolphin
which
bore
the
water
to
the
basin
who
knows
how
long
this
silent
scene
might
have
continued
could
the
lady
have
endured
it
with
the
most
bewitching
grace
the
lovely
girl
advanced
towards
him
and
passing
her
arm
round
his
neck
raised
his
hand
to
her
lips
calmly
and
unmoved
the
strange
being
suffered
her
caresses
but
did
not
return
them
this
scene
moved
me
strangely
it
was
the
man
that
chiefly
excited
my
sympathy
and
interest
some
violent
emotion
seemed
to
struggle
in
his
breast
it
was
as
if
some
irresistible
force
drew
him
towards
her
while
an
unseen
arm
held
him
back
silent
but
agonizing
was
the
struggle
and
beautiful
the
temptation
no
i
thought
he
attempts
too
much
he
will
he
must
at
his
silent
intimation
the
young
negro
disappeared
i
now
expected
some
touching
scene
a
prayer
on
bended
knees
and
a
reconciliation
sealed
with
glowing
kisses
but
no
nothing
of
the
kind
occurred
the
incomprehensible
being
took
from
his
pocketbook
a
sealed
packet
and
placed
it
in
the
hands
of
the
lady
sadness
overcast
her
face
as
she
she
looked
at
it
and
a
tear
bedewed
her
eye
after
a
short
silence
they
separated
at
this
moment
an
elderly
lady
advanced
from
one
of
the
sidewalks
who
had
remained
at
a
distance
and
whom
i
now
first
discovered
she
and
the
fair
girl
slowly
advanced
along
the
path
and
while
they
were
earnestly
engaged
in
conversation
the
stranger
took
the
opportunity
of
remaining
behind
with
his
eyes
turned
towards
her
he
stood
irresolute
at
one
instant
making
a
rapid
step
forward
and
in
the
next
retreating
in
another
moment
he
had
disappeared
in
the
copse
the
women
at
length
look
round
seem
uneasy
at
not
finding
him
and
pause
as
if
to
await
his
coming
he
comes
not
anxious
glances
are
cast
around
and
steps
are
redoubled
my
eyes
aid
in
searching
through
the
garden
he
comes
not
he
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
suddenly
i
see
a
plash
in
the
canal
and
see
a
gondola
moving
from
the
shore
it
is
he
and
i
scarcely
can
refrain
from
calling
to
him
now
the
whole
thing
is
clear
it
was
a
parting
she
appears
to
have
a
presentiment
of
what
has
happened
with
a
speed
that
her
companion
can
not
use
she
hastens
to
the
shore
too
late
quick
as
the
arrow
in
its
flight
the
gondola
bounds
forward
and
soon
nothing
is
visible
but
a
white
handkerchief
fluttering
in
the
air
from
afar
soon
after
this
i
saw
the
fair
incognita
and
her
companion
cross
the
water
when
i
awoke
from
a
short
sleep
i
could
not
help
smiling
at
my
delusion
my
fancy
had
incorporated
these
events
in
my
dreams
until
truth
itself
seemed
a
dream
a
maiden
fair
as
an
houri
wandering
beneath
my
windows
at
break
of
day
with
her
lover
and
a
lover
who
did
not
know
how
to
make
a
better
use
of
such
an
hour
surely
these
supplied
materials
for
the
composition
of
a
picture
which
might
well
occupy
the
fancy
of
a
dreamer
but
the
dream
had
been
too
lovely
for
me
not
to
desire
its
renewal
again
and
again
nay
even
the
garden
had
become
more
charming
in
my
sight
since
my
imagination
had
peopled
it
with
such
attractive
forms
several
cheerless
days
that
succeeded
this
eventful
morning
drove
me
from
the
window
but
the
first
fine
evening
involuntarily
drew
me
back
to
my
post
of
observation
judge
of
my
surprise
when
after
a
short
search
i
caught
sight
of
the
white
dress
of
my
incognita
yes
it
was
she
herself
i
had
not
dreamed
her
former
companion
was
with
her
and
led
by
the
hand
a
little
boy
but
the
fair
girl
herself
walked
apart
and
seemed
absorbed
in
thought
all
spots
were
visited
that
had
been
rendered
memorable
by
the
presence
of
her
friend
she
paused
for
a
long
time
before
the
basin
and
her
fixed
gaze
seemed
to
seek
on
its
crystal
mirror
the
reflection
of
one
beloved
form
although
her
noble
beauty
had
attracted
me
when
i
first
saw
her
the
impression
produced
was
even
stronger
on
this
occasion
although
perhaps
at
the
same
time
more
conducive
to
gentler
emotions
i
had
now
ample
opportunity
of
considering
this
divine
form
the
surprise
of
the
first
impression
gradually
gave
place
to
softer
feelings
the
glory
that
seemed
to
invest
her
had
departed
and
i
saw
before
me
the
loveliest
of
women
and
felt
my
senses
inflamed
in
a
moment
the
resolution
was
formed
that
she
must
be
mine
while
i
was
deliberating
whether
i
should
descend
and
approach
her
or
whether
before
i
ventured
on
such
a
step
it
would
not
be
better
to
obtain
information
regarding
her
a
door
opened
in
the
convent
wall
through
which
there
advanced
a
carmelite
monk
the
sound
of
his
approach
roused
the
lady
and
i
saw
her
advance
with
hurried
steps
towards
him
he
drew
from
his
bosom
a
paper
which
she
eagerly
grasped
while
a
vivid
color
instantaneously
suffused
her
countenance
at
this
moment
i
was
called
from
the
window
by
the
arrival
of
my
usual
evening
visitor
i
carefully
avoided
approaching
the
spot
again
as
i
had
no
desire
to
share
my
conquest
with
another
for
a
whole
hour
i
was
obliged
to
endure
this
painful
constraint
before
i
could
succeed
in
freeing
myself
from
my
importunate
guest
and
when
i
hastened
to
the
window
all
had
disappeared
the
garden
was
empty
when
i
entered
it
no
vessel
of
any
kind
was
visible
in
the
canal
no
trace
of
people
on
any
side
i
neither
knew
whence
she
had
come
nor
whither
she
had
gone
while
i
was
looking
round
me
in
all
directions
i
observed
something
white
upon
the
ground
on
drawing
near
i
found
it
was
a
piece
of
paper
folded
in
the
shape
of
a
note
what
could
it
be
but
the
letter
which
the
carmelite
had
brought
happy
discovery
i
exclaimed
this
will
reveal
the
whole
secret
and
make
me
master
of
her
the
letter
was
sealed
with
a
sphinx
had
no
superscription
and
was
written
in
cyphers
this
however
did
not
discourage
me
for
i
have
some
knowledge
of
this
mode
of
writing
i
copied
it
hastily
as
there
was
every
reason
to
expect
that
she
would
soon
miss
it
and
return
in
search
of
it
if
she
should
not
find
it
she
would
regard
its
loss
as
an
evidence
that
the
garden
was
resorted
to
by
different
persons
and
such
a
discovery
might
easily
deter
her
from
visiting
it
again
and
what
worse
fortune
could
attend
my
hopes
that
which
i
had
conjectured
actually
took
place
and
i
had
scarcely
ended
my
copy
when
she
reappeared
with
her
former
companion
anxiously
intent
on
the
search
i
attached
the
note
to
a
tile
which
i
had
detached
from
the
roof
and
dropped
it
at
a
spot
which
she
would
pass
her
gracefully
expressed
joy
at
finding
it
rewarded
me
for
my
generosity
she
examined
it
in
every
part
with
keen
searching
glances
as
if
she
were
seeking
to
detect
the
unhallowed
hands
that
might
have
touched
it
but
the
contented
look
with
which
she
hid
it
in
her
bosom
showed
that
she
was
free
from
all
suspicion
she
went
and
the
parting
glance
she
threw
on
the
garden
seemed
expressive
of
gratitude
to
the
guardian
deities
of
the
spot
who
had
so
faithfully
watched
over
the
secret
of
her
heart
i
now
hastened
to
decipher
the
letter
after
trying
several
languages
i
at
length
succeeded
by
the
use
of
english
its
contents
were
so
remarkable
that
my
memory
still
retains
a
perfect
recollection
of
i
am
interrupted
and
must
give
you
the
conclusion
on
a
future
occasion
letter
viii
baron
f
to
count
o
august
in
truth
my
dearest
friend
you
do
the
good
biondello
injustice
the
suspicion
you
entertain
against
him
is
unfounded
and
while
i
allow
you
full
liberty
to
condemn
all
italians
generally
i
must
maintain
that
this
one
at
least
is
an
honest
man
you
think
it
singular
that
a
person
of
such
brilliant
endowments
and
such
exemplary
conduct
should
debase
himself
to
enter
the
service
of
another
if
he
were
not
actuated
by
secret
motives
and
these
you
further
conclude
must
necessarily
be
of
a
suspicious
character
but
where
is
the
novelty
of
a
man
of
talent
and
of
merit
endeavoring
to
win
favor
with
a
prince
who
has
the
power
of
establishing
his
fortune
is
there
anything
derogatory
in
serving
the
prince
and
has
not
biondello
clearly
shown
that
his
devotion
is
purely
personal
by
confessing
that
he
earnestly
desired
to
make
a
certain
request
of
the
prince
the
whole
mystery
will
therefore
no
doubt
be
revealed
when
he
acquaints
him
of
his
wishes
he
may
certainly
be
actuated
by
secret
motives
but
why
may
these
not
be
innocent
in
their
nature
you
think
it
strange
that
this
biondello
should
have
kept
all
his
great
talents
concealed
and
in
no
way
have
attracted
attention
during
the
early
months
of
our
acquaintance
with
him
when
you
were
still
with
us
this
i
grant
but
what
opportunity
had
he
then
of
distinguishing
himself
the
prince
had
not
yet
called
his
powers
into
requisition
and
chance
therefore
could
alone
aid
us
in
discovering
his
talents
he
very
recently
gave
a
proof
of
his
devotion
and
honesty
of
purpose
which
must
at
once
annihilate
all
your
doubts
the
prince
was
watched
measures
were
being
taken
to
gain
information
regarding
his
mode
of
life
associates
and
general
habits
i
know
not
with
whom
this
inquisitiveness
originated
let
me
beg
your
attention
however
to
what
i
am
about
to
relate
there
is
a
house
in
george
s
which
biondello
is
in
the
habit
of
frequenting
he
probably
finds
some
peculiar
attractions
there
but
of
this
i
know
nothing
it
happened
a
few
days
ago
that
he
there
met
assembled
together
a
party
of
civil
and
military
officers
in
the
service
of
the
government
old
acquaintances
and
jovial
comrades
of
his
own
surprise
and
pleasure
were
expressed
on
all
sides
at
this
meeting
their
former
was
and
after
each
in
turn
had
related
his
own
history
up
to
the
present
time
biondello
was
called
upon
to
give
an
account
of
his
life
this
he
did
in
a
few
words
he
was
congratulated
on
his
new
position
his
companions
had
heard
accounts
of
the
splendid
footing
on
which
the
prince
of
s
establishment
was
maintained
of
his
liberality
especially
to
persons
who
showed
discretion
in
keeping
secrets
the
prince
s
connection
with
the
cardinal
a
i
was
well
known
he
was
said
to
be
addicted
to
play
etc
biondello
s
surprise
at
this
is
observed
and
jokes
are
passed
upon
the
mystery
which
he
tries
to
keep
up
although
it
is
well
known
that
he
is
the
emissary
of
the
prince
of
the
two
lawyers
of
the
party
make
him
sit
down
between
them
their
glasses
are
repeatedly
emptied
he
is
urged
to
drink
but
excuses
himself
on
the
grounds
of
inability
to
bear
wine
at
last
however
he
yields
to
their
wishes
in
order
that
he
may
the
better
pretend
intoxication
yes
cried
one
of
the
lawyers
biondello
understands
his
business
but
he
has
not
yet
learned
all
the
tricks
of
the
trade
he
is
but
a
what
have
i
still
to
learn
ask
biondello
you
understand
the
art
of
keeping
a
secret
remarked
the
other
but
you
have
still
to
learn
that
of
parting
with
it
to
am
i
likely
to
find
a
purchaser
for
any
that
i
may
have
to
dispose
of
asked
biondello
on
this
the
other
guests
withdrew
from
the
apartment
and
left
him
alone
with
his
two
neighbors
who
continued
the
conversation
in
the
same
strain
the
substance
of
the
whole
was
however
briefly
as
follows
biondello
was
to
procure
them
certain
information
regarding
the
intercourse
of
the
prince
with
the
cardinal
and
his
nephew
acquaint
them
with
the
source
from
whence
the
prince
derived
his
money
and
to
intercept
all
letters
written
to
count
o
biondello
put
them
off
to
a
future
occasion
but
he
was
unsuccessful
in
his
attempts
to
draw
from
them
the
name
of
the
person
by
whom
they
were
employed
from
the
splendid
nature
of
the
proposals
made
to
him
it
was
evident
however
that
they
emanated
from
some
influential
and
extremely
wealthy
party
last
night
he
related
the
whole
occurrence
to
the
prince
whose
first
impulse
was
without
further
ceremony
to
secure
the
maneuverers
at
once
but
to
this
biondello
strongly
objected
he
urged
that
he
would
be
obliged
to
set
them
at
liberty
again
and
that
in
this
case
he
should
endanger
not
only
his
credit
among
this
class
of
men
but
even
his
life
all
these
men
were
connected
together
and
bound
by
one
common
interest
each
one
making
the
cause
of
the
others
his
own
in
fact
he
would
rather
make
enemies
of
the
senate
of
venice
than
be
regarded
by
these
men
as
a
traitor
and
besides
he
could
no
longer
be
useful
to
the
prince
if
he
lost
the
confidence
of
this
class
of
people
we
have
pondered
and
conjectured
much
as
to
the
source
of
all
this
who
is
there
in
venice
that
can
care
to
know
what
money
my
master
receives
or
pays
out
what
passess
between
cardinal
a
and
himself
and
what
i
write
to
you
can
it
be
some
scheme
of
the
prince
of
or
is
the
armenian

the

baron
f
to
count
o
august
the
prince
is
revelling
in
love
and
bliss
he
has
recovered
his
fair
greek
i
must
relate
to
you
how
this
happened
a
traveller
who
had
crossed
from
chiozza
gave
the
prince
so
animated
an
account
of
the
beauty
of
this
place
which
is
charmingly
situated
on
the
shores
of
the
gulf
that
he
became
very
anxious
to
see
it
yesterday
was
fixed
upon
for
the
excursion
and
in
order
to
avoid
all
restraint
and
display
no
one
was
to
accompany
him
but
z
and
myself
together
with
biondello
as
my
master
wished
to
remain
unknown
we
found
a
vessel
ready
to
start
and
engaged
our
passage
at
once
the
company
was
very
mixed
but
not
numerous
and
the
passage
was
made
without
the
occurrence
of
any
circumstance
worthy
of
notice
chiozza
is
built
like
venice
on
a
foundation
of
wooden
piles
and
is
said
to
contain
about
forty
thousand
inhabitants
there
are
but
few
of
the
higher
classes
resident
there
but
one
meets
sailors
and
fishermen
at
every
step
whoever
appears
in
a
peruke
or
a
cloak
is
regarded
as
an
aristocrat
a
rich
man
the
cap
and
overcoat
are
here
the
insignia
of
the
poor
the
situation
is
certainly
very
lovely
but
it
will
not
bear
a
comparison
with
venice
we
did
not
remain
long
for
the
captain
who
had
more
passengers
for
the
return
voyage
was
obliged
to
be
in
venice
at
an
early
hour
and
there
was
nothing
at
chiozza
to
make
the
prince
desirous
of
remaining
all
the
passengers
were
on
board
when
we
reached
the
vessel
as
we
had
found
it
so
difficult
to
place
ourselves
on
a
social
footing
with
the
company
on
the
outward
passage
we
determined
on
this
occasion
to
secure
a
cabin
to
ourselves
the
prince
inquired
who
the
were
and
was
informed
that
they
were
a
dominican
and
some
ladies
who
were
returning
to
venice
my
master
evincing
no
curiosity
to
see
them
we
immediately
betook
ourselves
to
our
cabin
the
greek
was
the
subject
of
our
conversation
throughout
the
whole
passage
as
she
had
been
during
our
former
transit
the
prince
dwelt
with
ardor
on
her
appearance
in
the
church
and
whilst
numerous
plans
were
in
turn
devised
and
rejected
hours
passed
like
a
moment
of
time
and
we
were
already
in
sight
of
venice
some
of
the
passengers
now
disembarked
the
dominican
amongst
the
number
the
captain
went
to
the
ladies
who
as
we
now
first
learned
had
been
separated
from
us
by
only
a
thin
wooden
partition
and
asked
them
where
they
wished
to
land
the
island
of
murano
was
named
in
reply
to
his
inquiry
and
the
house
indicated
the
island
of
murano
exclaimed
the
prince
who
seemed
suddenly
struck
by
a
startling
presentiment
before
i
could
reply
to
his
exclamation
biondello
rushed
into
the
cabin
do
you
know
asked
he
eagerly
who
is
on
board
with
us
the
prince
started
to
his
feet
as
biondello
continued
she
is
here
she
herself
i
have
just
spoken
to
her
companion
the
prince
hurried
out
he
felt
as
if
he
could
not
breathe
in
our
narrow
cabin
and
i
believe
at
that
moment
as
if
the
whole
world
would
have
been
too
narrow
for
him
a
thousand
conflicting
feelings
struggled
for
the
mastery
in
his
heart
his
knees
trembled
and
his
countenance
was
alternately
flushed
and
pallid
i
sympathized
and
participated
in
his
emotion
but
i
can
not
by
words
convey
to
your
mind
any
idea
of
the
state
in
which
he
was
when
we
stopped
at
murano
the
prince
sprang
on
shore
she
advanced
from
her
cabin
i
read
in
the
face
of
the
prince
that
it
was
indeed
the
greek
one
glance
was
sufficient
to
dispel
all
doubt
on
that
point
a
more
lovely
creature
i
have
never
seen
even
the
prince
s
glowing
descriptions
fell
far
short
of
the
reality
a
radiant
blush
suffused
her
face
when
she
saw
my
master
she
must
have
heard
all
we
said
and
could
not
fail
to
know
that
she
herself
had
been
the
subject
of
our
conversation
she
exchanged
a
significant
glance
with
her
companion
which
seemed
to
say
that
is
he
and
then
cast
her
eyes
to
the
ground
with
diffident
confusion
on
placing
her
foot
on
the
narrow
plank
which
had
been
thrown
from
the
vessel
to
the
shore
she
seemed
anxiously
to
hesitate
less
as
it
seemed
to
me
from
the
fear
of
falling
than
from
her
inability
to
cross
the
board
without
assistance
which
was
proffered
her
by
the
outstretched
arm
of
the
prince
necessity
overcame
her
reluctance
and
accepting
the
aid
of
his
hand
she
stepped
on
shore
excessive
mental
agitation
had
rendered
the
prince
uncourteous
and
he
wholly
forgot
to
offer
his
services
to
the
other
lady
but
what
was
there
that
he
would
not
have
forgotten
at
this
moment
my
attention
in
atoning
for
the
remissness
of
the
prince
prevented
my
hearing
the
commencement
of
a
conversation
which
had
begun
between
him
and
the
young
greek
while
i
had
been
helping
the
other
lady
on
shore
he
was
still
holding
her
hand
in
his
probably
from
absence
of
mind
and
without
being
conscious
of
the
fact
this
is
not
the
first
time
signora
that
that
he
stopped
short
unable
to
finish
the
sentence
i
think
i
remember
she
faltered
we
met
in
the
church
of
said
he
quickly
yes
it
was
in
the
church
of
she
rejoined
and
could
i
have
supposed
that
this
day
would
have
brought
me
here
she
gently
withdrew
her
hand
from
his
he
was
evidently
embarrassed
but
biondello
who
had
in
the
meantime
been
speaking
to
the
servant
now
came
to
his
aid
said
he
the
ladies
had
ordered
sedans
to
be
in
readiness
for
them
they
have
not
yet
come
for
we
are
here
before
the
expected
time
but
there
is
a
garden
close
by
in
which
you
may
remain
until
the
crowd
has
the
proposal
was
accepted
you
may
conceive
with
what
alacrity
on
the
part
of
the
prince
we
remained
in
the
garden
till
late
in
the
evening
and
fortunately
z
and
myself
so
effectually
succeeded
in
occupying
the
attention
of
the
elder
lady
that
the
prince
was
enabled
undisturbed
to
carry
on
his
conversation
with
the
fair
greek
you
will
easily
believe
that
he
made
good
use
of
his
time
when
i
tell
you
that
he
obtained
permission
to
visit
her
at
the
very
moment
that
i
am
now
writing
he
is
with
her
on
his
return
i
shall
be
able
to
give
you
further
particulars
regarding
her
when
we
got
home
yesterday
we
found
that
the
remittances
had
arrived
from
our
court
but
at
the
same
time
the
prince
received
a
letter
which
excited
his
indignation
to
the
highest
pitch
he
has
been
recalled
and
that
in
a
tone
and
manner
to
which
he
is
wholly
unaccustomed
he
immediately
wrote
a
reply
in
a
similar
spirit
and
intends
remaining
the
remittances
are
only
just
sufficient
to
pay
the
interest
on
the
capital
which
he
owes
we
are
looking
with
impatience
for
a
reply
from
his
sister
letter
baron
f
to
count
o
september
the
prince
has
fallen
out
with
his
court
and
all
resources
have
consequently
been
cut
off
from
home
the
term
of
six
weeks
at
the
end
of
which
my
master
was
to
pay
the
marquis
has
already
elapsed
several
days
but
still
no
remittances
have
been
forwarded
either
from
his
cousin
of
whom
he
had
earnestly
requested
an
additional
allowance
in
advance
or
from
his
sister
you
may
readily
suppose
that
civitella
has
not
reminded
him
of
his
debt
the
prince
s
memory
is
however
all
the
more
faithful
yesterday
morning
at
length
brought
an
answer
from
the
seat
of
government
we
had
shortly
before
concluded
a
new
arrangement
with
the
master
of
our
hotel
and
the
prince
had
publicly
announced
his
intention
to
remain
here
sometime
longer
without
uttering
a
word
my
master
put
the
letter
into
my
hand
his
eyes
sparkled
and
i
could
read
the
contents
in
his
face
can
you
believe
it
dear
o
all
my
master
s
proceedings
here
are
known
at
and
have
been
most
calumniously
misrepresented
by
an
abominable
tissue
of
lies
information
has
been
received
says
the
letter
amongst
other
things
to
the
effect
that
the
prince
has
for
some
time
past
belied
his
former
character
and
adopted
a
node
of
conduct
totally
at
variance
with
his
former
exemplary
manner
of
acting
and
it
is
known
the
writer
says
that
he
has
addicted
himself
with
the
greatest
excess
to
women
and
play
that
he
is
overwhelmed
with
debts
puts
his
confidence
in
visionaries
and
charlatans
who
pretend
to
have
power
over
spirits
maintains
suspicious
relations
with
roman
catholic
prelates
and
keeps
up
a
degree
of
state
which
exceeds
both
his
rank
and
his
means
nay
it
is
even
said
that
he
is
about
to
bring
this
highly
offensive
conduct
to
a
climax
by
apostacy
to
the
church
of
rome
and
in
order
to
clear
himself
from
this
last
charge
he
is
required
to
return
immediately
a
banker
at
venice
to
whom
he
must
make
known
the
true
amount
of
his
debts
has
received
instructions
to
satisfy
his
creditors
immediately
after
his
departure
for
under
existing
circumstances
it
does
not
appear
expedient
to
remit
the
money
directly
into
his
what
accusations
and
what
a
mode
of
preferring
them
i
read
the
letter
again
and
again
in
the
hope
of
discovering
some
expression
that
admitted
of
a
milder
construction
but
in
vain
it
was
wholly
incomprehensible
z
now
reminded
me
of
the
secret
inquiries
which
had
been
made
some
time
before
of
biondello
the
true
nature
of
the
inquiries
and
circumstances
all
coincided
he
had
falsely
ascribed
them
to
the
armenian
but
now
the
source
from
whence
the
came
was
very
evident
apostacy
but
who
can
have
any
interest
in
calumniating
my
master
so
scandalously
i
should
fear
it
was
some
machination
of
the
prince
of
who
is
determined
on
driving
him
from
venice
in
the
meantime
the
prince
remained
absorbed
in
thought
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
his
continued
silence
alarmed
me
i
threw
myself
at
his
feet
for
god
s
sake
your
highness
i
cried
moderate
your
feelings
you
will
nay
you
shall
have
satisfaction
leave
the
whole
affair
to
me
let
me
be
your
emissary
it
is
beneath
your
dignity
to
reply
to
such
accusations
but
you
will
not
i
know
refuse
me
the
privilege
of
doing
so
for
you
the
name
of
your
calumniator
must
be
given
up
and
s
eyes
must
be
at
this
moment
we
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
civitella
who
inquired
with
surprise
into
the
cause
of
our
agitation
z
and
i
did
not
answer
but
the
prince
who
had
long
ceased
to
make
any
distinction
between
him
and
us
and
who
besides
was
too
much
excited
to
listen
to
the
dictates
of
prudence
desired
me
to
communicate
the
contents
of
the
letter
to
him
on
my
hesitating
to
obey
him
he
snatched
the
letter
from
my
hand
and
gave
it
to
the
marquis
i
am
in
your
debt
marquis
said
he
as
civitella
gave
him
back
the
letter
after
perusing
it
with
evident
astonishment
but
do
not
let
that
circumstance
occasion
you
any
uneasiness
grant
me
but
a
respite
of
twenty
days
and
you
shall
be
fully
do
i
deserve
this
at
your
hands
gracious
prince
exclaimed
civitella
with
extreme
emotion
you
have
refrained
from
pressing
me
and
i
gratefully
appreciate
your
delicacy
in
twenty
days
as
i
before
said
you
shall
be
fully
but
how
is
this
asked
civitella
with
agitation
and
surprise
what
means
all
this
i
can
not
comprehend
we
explained
to
him
all
that
we
knew
and
his
indignation
was
unbounded
the
prince
he
asserted
must
insist
upon
full
satisfaction
the
insult
was
unparalleled
in
the
meanwhile
he
implored
him
to
make
unlimited
use
of
his
fortune
and
his
credit
when
the
marquis
left
us
the
prince
still
continued
silent
he
paced
the
apartment
with
quick
and
determined
steps
as
if
some
strange
and
unusual
emotion
were
agitating
his
frame
at
length
he
paused
muttering
between
his
teeth
congratulate
yourself
he
died
at
ten
o
we
looked
at
him
in
terror
congratulate
yourself
he
repeated
did
he
not
say
that
i
should
congratulate
myself
what
could
he
have
meant
what
has
reminded
you
of
those
words
i
asked
and
what
have
they
to
do
with
the
present
business
i
did
not
then
understand
what
the
man
meant
but
now
i
do
oh
it
is
intolerable
to
be
subject
to
a
gracious
prince
who
can
make
us
feel
our
dependence
ha
it
must
be
sweet
he
again
paused
his
looks
alarmed
me
for
i
had
never
before
seen
him
thus
agitated
whether
a
man
be
poorest
of
the
poor
he
continued
or
the
next
heir
to
the
throne
it
is
all
one
and
the
same
thing
there
is
but
one
difference
between
men
to
obey
or
to
he
again
glanced
over
the
letter
you
know
the
man
he
continued
who
has
dared
to
write
these
words
to
me
would
you
salute
him
in
the
street
if
fate
had
not
made
him
your
master
by
heaven
there
is
something
great
in
a
he
went
on
in
this
strain
giving
expression
to
many
things
which
i
dare
not
trust
to
paper
on
this
occasion
the
prince
confided
a
circumstance
to
me
which
alike
surprised
and
terrified
me
and
which
may
be
followed
by
the
most
alarming
consequences
we
have
hitherto
been
entirely
deceived
regarding
the
family
relations
of
the
court
of
he
answered
the
letter
on
the
spot
notwithstanding
my
earnest
entreaty
that
he
should
postpone
doing
so
and
the
strain
in
which
he
wrote
leaves
no
ground
to
hope
for
a
favorable
settlement
of
those
differences
you
are
no
doubt
impatient
dear
o
to
hear
something
definite
with
respect
to
the
greek
but
in
truth
i
have
very
little
to
tell
you
from
the
prince
i
can
learn
nothing
as
he
has
been
admitted
into
her
confidence
and
is
i
believe
bound
to
secrecy
the
fact
has
however
transpired
that
she
is
not
a
greek
as
we
supposed
but
a
german
of
the
highest
descent
from
a
certain
report
that
has
reached
me
it
would
appear
that
her
mother
is
of
the
most
exalted
rank
and
that
she
is
the
fruit
of
an
unfortunate
amour
which
was
once
talked
of
all
over
europe
a
course
of
secret
persecution
to
which
she
had
been
exposed
in
consequence
of
her
origin
compelled
her
to
seek
protection
in
venice
and
to
adopt
that
concealment
which
had
rendered
it
impossible
for
the
prince
to
discover
her
retreat
the
respect
with
which
the
prince
speaks
of
her
and
a
certain
deferential
deportment
which
he
maintains
towards
her
appear
to
corroborate
the
truth
of
this
report
he
is
devoted
to
her
with
a
fearful
intensity
of
passion
which
increases
day
by
day
in
the
earliest
stage
of
their
acquaintance
but
few
interviews
were
granted
but
after
the
first
week
the
separations
were
of
shorter
duration
and
now
there
is
scarce
a
day
on
which
the
prince
is
not
with
her
whole
evenings
pass
without
our
even
seeing
him
and
when
he
is
not
with
her
she
appears
to
form
the
sole
object
of
his
thoughts
his
whole
being
seems
metamorphosed
he
goes
about
as
if
wrapped
in
a
dream
and
nothing
that
formerly
interested
him
has
now
power
to
arrest
his
attention
even
for
a
moment
how
will
this
end
my
dear
friend
i
tremble
for
the
future
the
rupture
with
his
court
has
placed
my
master
in
a
state
of
humiliating
dependence
on
one
sole
person
the
marquis
civitella
this
man
is
now
master
of
our
secrets
of
our
whole
fate
will
he
always
conduct
himself
as
nobly
as
he
does
now
are
his
good
intentions
to
be
relied
upon
and
is
it
expedient
to
confide
so
much
weight
and
power
to
one
person
even
were
he
the
best
of
men
the
prince
s
sister
has
again
been
written
to
the
result
of
this
fresh
appeal
you

next
letter
count
o
in
continuation
this
letter
never
reached
me
three
months
passed
without
my
receiving
any
tidings
from
venice
an
interruption
to
our
correspondence
which
the
sequel
but
too
clearly
explained
all
my
friend
s
letters
to
me
had
been
kept
back
and
suppressed
my
emotion
may
be
conceived
when
in
the
december
of
the
same
year
the
following
letter
reached
me
by
mere
accident
as
it
afterwards
appeared
owing
to
the
sudden
illness
of
biondello
into
whose
hands
it
had
been
committed
you
do
not
write
you
do
not
answer
me
come
i
entreat
you
come
on
the
wings
of
friendship
our
hopes
are
fled
read
the
enclosed
all
our
hopes
are
at
an
end
the
wounds
of
the
marquis
are
reported
mortal
the
cardinal
vows
vengeance
and
his
bravos
are
in
pursuit
of
the
prince
my
master
oh
my
unhappy
master
has
it
come
to
this
wretched
horrible
fate
we
are
compelled
to
hide
ourselves
like
malefactors
from
assassins
and
creditors
i
am
writing
to
you
from
the
convent
of
where
the
prince
has
found
an
asylum
at
this
moment
he
is
resting
on
his
hard
couch
by
my
side
and
is
sleeping
but
alas
it
is
only
the
sleep
of
deadly
exhaustion
that
will
but
give
him
new
strength
for
new
trials
during
the
ten
days
that
she
was
ill
no
sleep
closed
his
eyes
i
was
present
when
the
body
was
opened
traces
of
poison
were
detected
she
is
to
be
buried
alas
dearest
o
my
heart
is
rent
i
have
lived
through
scenes
that
can
never
be
effaced
from
my
memory
i
stood
beside
her
deathbed
she
departed
like
a
saint
and
her
last
strength
was
spent
in
trying
with
persuasive
eloquence
to
lead
her
lover
into
the
path
that
she
was
treading
in
her
way
to
heaven
our
firmness
was
completely
gone
the
prince
alone
maintained
his
fortitude
and
although
he
suffered
a
triple
agony
of
death
with
her
he
yet
retained
strength
of
mind
sufficient
to
refuse
the
last
prayer
of
the
pious
this
letter
contained
the
following
enclosure
to
the
prince
of
from
his
sister
the
one
sole
redeeming
church
which
has
made
so
glorious
a
conquest
of
the
prince
of
will
surely
not
refuse
to
supply
him
with
means
to
pursue
the
mode
of
life
to
which
she
owes
this
conquest
i
have
tears
and
prayers
for
one
that
has
gone
astray
but
nothing
further
to
bestow
on
one
so
worthless
i
instantly
threw
myself
into
a
carriage
travelled
night
and
day
and
in
the
third
week
i
was
in
venice
my
speed
availed
nothing
i
had
come
to
bring
comfort
and
help
to
an
unhappy
one
but
i
found
a
happy
one
who
needed
not
my
weak
aid
f
was
ill
when
i
arrived
and
unable
to
see
me
but
the
following
note
was
brought
to
me
from
him
return
dearest
o
to
whence
you
came
the
prince
no
longer
needs
you
or
me
his
debts
have
been
paid
the
cardinal
is
reconciled
to
him
and
the
marquis
has
recovered
do
you
remember
the
armenian
who
perplexed
us
so
much
last
year
in
his
arms
you
will
find
the
prince
who
five
days
since
attended
mass
for
the
first
notwithstanding
all
this
i
earnestly
sought
an
interview
with
the
prince
but
was
refused
by
the
bedside
of
my
friend
i
learnt
the
particulars
of
this
strange
story
the
sport
of
destiny
aloysius
von
g
was
the
son
of
a
citizen
of
distinction
in
the
service
of
and
the
germs
of
his
fertile
genius
had
been
early
developed
by
a
liberal
education
while
yet
very
young
but
already
well
grounded
in
the
principles
of
knowledge
he
entered
the
military
service
of
his
sovereign
to
whom
he
soon
made
himself
known
as
a
young
man
of
great
merit
and
still
greater
promise
g
was
now
in
the
full
glow
of
youth
so
also
was
the
prince
g
was
ardent
and
enterprising
the
prince
of
a
similar
disposition
loved
such
characters
endued
with
brilliant
wit
and
a
rich
fund
of
information
g
possessed
the
art
of
ingratiating
himself
with
all
around
him
he
enlivened
every
circle
in
which
he
moved
by
his
felicitous
humor
and
infused
life
and
spirit
into
every
subject
that
came
before
him
the
prince
had
discernment
enough
to
appreciate
in
another
those
virtues
which
he
himself
possessed
in
an
eminent
degree
everything
which
g
undertook
even
to
his
very
sports
had
an
air
of
grandeur
no
difficulties
could
daunt
him
no
failures
vanquish
his
perseverance
the
value
of
these
qualities
was
increased
by
an
attractive
person
the
perfect
image
of
blooming
health
and
herculean
strength
and
heightened
by
the
eloquent
expression
natural
to
an
active
mind
to
these
was
added
a
certain
native
and
unaffected
dignity
chastened
and
subdued
by
a
noble
modesty
if
the
prince
was
charmed
with
the
intellectual
attractions
of
his
young
companion
his
fascinating
exterior
irresistibly
captivated
his
senses
similarity
of
age
of
tastes
and
of
character
soon
produced
an
intimacy
between
them
which
possessed
all
the
strength
of
friendship
and
all
the
warmth
and
fervor
of
the
most
passionate
love
g
rose
with
rapidity
from
one
promotion
to
another
but
whatever
the
extent
of
favors
conferred
they
still
seemed
in
the
estimation
of
the
prince
to
fall
short
of
his
deserts
his
fortune
advanced
with
gigantic
strides
for
the
author
of
his
greatness
was
his
devoted
admirer
and
his
warmest
friend
not
yet
years
of
age
he
already
saw
himself
placed
on
an
eminence
hitherto
attained
only
by
the
most
fortunate
at
the
close
of
their
career
but
his
active
spirit
was
incapable
of
reposing
long
in
the
lap
of
indolent
vanity
or
of
contenting
itself
with
the
glittering
pomp
of
an
elevated
office
to
perform
the
behests
of
which
he
was
conscious
of
possessing
both
the
requisite
courage
and
the
abilities
whilst
the
prince
was
engaged
in
rounds
of
pleasure
his
young
favorite
buried
himself
among
archives
and
books
and
devoted
himself
with
laborious
assiduity
to
affairs
of
state
in
which
he
at
length
became
so
expert
that
every
matter
of
importance
passed
through
his
hands
from
the
companion
of
his
pleasures
he
soon
became
first
councillor
and
minister
and
finally
the
ruler
of
his
sovereign
in
a
short
time
there
was
no
road
to
the
prince
s
favor
but
through
him
he
disposed
of
all
offices
and
dignities
all
rewards
were
received
from
his
hands
g
had
attained
this
vast
influence
at
too
early
an
age
and
had
risen
by
too
rapid
strides
to
enjoy
his
power
with
moderation
the
eminence
on
which
he
beheld
himself
made
his
ambition
dizzy
and
no
sooner
was
the
final
object
of
his
wishes
attained
than
his
modesty
forsook
him
the
respectful
deference
shown
him
by
the
first
nobles
of
the
land
by
all
who
in
birth
fortune
and
reputation
so
far
surpassed
him
and
which
was
even
paid
to
him
youth
as
he
was
by
the
oldest
senators
intoxicated
his
pride
while
his
unlimited
power
served
to
develop
a
certain
harshness
which
had
been
latent
in
his
character
and
which
throughout
all
the
vicissitudes
of
his
fortune
remained
there
was
no
service
however
considerable
or
toilsome
which
his
friends
might
not
safely
ask
at
his
hands
but
his
enemies
might
well
tremble
for
in
proportion
as
he
was
extravagant
in
rewards
so
was
he
implacable
in
revenge
he
made
less
use
of
his
influence
to
enrich
himself
than
to
render
happy
a
number
of
beings
who
should
pay
homage
to
him
as
the
author
of
their
prosperity
but
caprice
alone
and
not
justice
dictated
the
choice
of
his
subjects
by
a
haughty
imperious
demeanor
he
alienated
the
hearts
even
of
those
whom
he
had
most
benefited
while
at
the
same
time
he
converted
his
rivals
and
secret
enviers
into
deadly
enemies
amongst
those
who
watched
all
his
movements
with
jealousy
and
envy
and
who
were
silently
preparing
instruments
for
his
destruction
was
joseph
martinengo
a
piedmontese
count
belonging
to
the
prince
s
suite
whom
g
himself
had
formerly
promoted
as
an
inoffensive
creature
devoted
to
his
interests
for
the
purpose
of
supplying
his
own
place
in
attending
upon
the
pleasures
of
the
prince
an
office
which
he
began
to
find
irksome
and
which
he
willingly
exchanged
for
more
useful
employment
viewing
this
man
merely
as
the
work
of
his
own
hands
whom
he
might
at
any
period
consign
to
his
former
insignificance
he
felt
assured
of
the
fidelity
of
his
creature
from
motives
of
fear
no
less
than
of
gratitude
he
fell
thus
into
the
error
committed
by
richelieu
when
he
made
over
to
louis
as
a
sort
of
plaything
the
young
le
grand
without
richelieu
s
sagacity
however
to
repair
his
error
he
had
to
deal
with
a
far
more
wily
enemy
than
fell
to
the
lot
of
the
french
minister
instead
of
boasting
of
his
good
fortune
or
allowing
his
benefactor
to
feel
that
he
could
now
dispense
with
his
patronage
martinengo
was
on
the
contrary
the
more
cautious
to
maintain
a
show
of
dependence
and
with
studied
humility
affected
to
attach
himself
more
and
more
closely
to
the
author
of
his
prosperity
meanwhile
he
did
not
omit
to
avail
himself
to
its
fullest
extent
of
the
opportunities
afforded
him
by
his
office
of
being
continually
about
the
prince
s
person
to
make
himself
daily
more
useful
and
eventually
indispensable
to
him
in
a
short
time
he
had
fathomed
the
prince
s
sentiments
thoroughly
had
discovered
all
the
avenues
to
his
confidence
and
imperceptibly
stolen
himself
into
his
favor
all
those
arts
which
a
noble
pride
and
a
natural
elevation
of
character
had
taught
the
minister
to
disdain
were
brought
into
play
by
the
italian
who
scrupled
not
to
avail
himself
of
the
most
despicable
means
for
attaining
his
object
well
aware
that
man
never
stands
so
much
in
need
of
a
guide
and
assistant
as
in
the
paths
of
vice
and
that
nothing
gives
a
stronger
title
to
bold
familiarity
than
a
participation
in
secret
indiscretions
he
took
measures
for
exciting
passions
in
the
prince
which
had
hitherto
lain
dormant
and
then
obtruded
himself
upon
him
as
a
confidant
and
an
accomplice
he
plunged
him
especially
into
those
excesses
which
least
of
all
endure
witnesses
and
imperceptibly
accustomed
the
prince
to
make
him
the
depository
of
secrets
to
which
no
third
person
was
admitted
upon
the
degradation
of
the
prince
s
character
he
now
began
to
found
his
infamous
schemes
of
aggrandizement
and
as
he
had
made
secrecy
a
means
of
success
he
had
obtained
entire
possession
of
his
master
s
heart
before
g
even
allowed
himself
to
suspect
that
he
shared
it
with
another
it
may
appear
singular
that
so
important
a
change
should
escape
the
minister
s
notice
but
g
was
too
well
assured
of
his
own
worth
ever
to
think
of
a
man
like
martinengo
in
the
light
of
a
competitor
while
the
latter
was
far
too
wily
and
too
much
on
his
guard
to
commit
the
least
error
which
might
tend
to
rouse
his
enemy
from
his
fatal
security
that
which
has
caused
thousands
of
his
predecessors
to
stumble
on
the
slippery
path
of
royal
favor
was
also
the
cause
of
g
s
fall
immoderate
the
secret
intimacy
between
his
creature
martinengo
and
his
royal
master
gave
him
no
uneasiness
he
readily
resigned
a
privilege
which
he
despised
and
which
had
never
been
the
object
of
his
ambition
it
was
only
because
it
smoothed
his
way
to
power
that
he
had
ever
valued
the
prince
s
friendship
and
he
inconsiderately
threw
down
the
ladder
by
which
he
had
risen
as
soon
as
he
had
attained
the
eminence
martinengo
was
not
the
man
to
rest
satisfied
with
so
subordinate
a
part
at
each
step
which
he
advanced
in
the
prince
s
favor
his
hopes
rose
higher
and
his
ambition
began
to
grasp
at
a
more
substantial
gratification
the
deceitful
humility
which
he
had
hitherto
found
it
necessary
to
maintain
towards
his
benefactor
became
daily
more
irksome
to
him
in
proportion
as
the
growth
of
his
reputation
awakened
his
pride
on
the
other
hand
the
minister
s
deportment
toward
him
by
no
means
improved
with
his
marked
progress
in
the
prince
s
favor
but
was
often
too
visibly
directed
to
rebuke
his
growing
pride
by
reminding
him
of
his
humble
origin
this
forced
and
unnatural
position
having
become
quite
insupportable
he
at
length
formed
the
determination
of
putting
an
end
to
it
by
the
destruction
of
his
rival
under
an
impenetrable
veil
of
dissimulation
he
brought
his
plan
to
maturity
he
dared
not
venture
as
yet
to
come
into
open
conflict
with
his
rival
for
although
the
first
glow
of
the
minister
s
favor
was
at
an
end
it
had
commenced
too
early
and
struck
root
too
deeply
in
the
bosom
of
the
prince
to
be
torn
from
it
abruptly
the
slightest
circumstance
might
restore
it
to
all
its
former
vigor
and
therefore
martinengo
well
understood
that
the
blow
which
he
was
about
to
strike
must
be
a
mortal
one
whatever
ground
g
might
have
lost
in
the
prince
s
affections
he
had
gained
in
his
respect
the
more
the
prince
withdrew
himself
from
the
affairs
of
state
the
less
could
he
dispense
with
the
services
of
a
man
who
with
the
most
conscientious
devotion
and
fidelity
had
consulted
his
master
s
interests
even
at
the
expense
of
the
country
and
g
was
now
as
indispensable
to
him
as
a
minister
as
he
had
formerly
been
dear
to
him
as
a
friend
by
what
means
the
italian
accomplished
his
purpose
has
remained
a
secret
between
those
on
whom
the
blow
fell
and
those
who
directed
it
it
was
reported
that
he
laid
before
the
prince
the
original
draughts
of
a
secret
and
very
suspicious
correspondence
which
g
is
said
to
have
carried
on
with
a
neighboring
court
but
opinions
differ
as
to
whether
the
letters
were
authentic
or
spurious
whatever
degree
of
truth
there
may
have
been
in
the
accusation
it
is
but
too
certain
that
it
fearfully
accomplished
the
end
in
view
in
the
eyes
of
the
prince
g
appeared
the
most
ungrateful
and
vilest
of
traitors
whose
treasonable
practices
were
so
thoroughly
proved
as
to
warrant
the
severest
measures
without
further
investigation
the
whole
affair
was
arranged
with
the
most
profound
secrecy
between
martinengo
and
his
master
so
that
g
had
not
the
most
distant
presentiment
of
the
impending
storm
he
continued
wrapped
in
this
fatal
security
until
the
dreadful
moment
in
which
he
was
destined
from
being
the
object
of
universal
homage
and
envy
to
become
that
of
the
deepest
commiseration
when
the
decisive
day
arrived
g
appeared
according
to
custom
upon
the
parade
he
had
risen
in
a
few
years
from
the
rank
of
ensign
to
that
of
colonel
and
even
this
was
only
a
modest
name
for
that
of
prime
minister
which
he
virtually
filled
and
which
placed
him
above
the
foremost
of
the
land
the
parade
was
the
place
where
his
pride
was
greeted
with
universal
homage
and
where
he
enjoyed
for
one
short
hour
the
dignity
for
which
he
endured
a
whole
day
of
toil
and
privation
those
of
the
highest
rank
approached
him
with
reverential
deference
and
those
who
were
not
assured
of
his
favor
with
fear
and
trembling
even
the
prince
whenever
he
visited
the
parade
saw
himself
neglected
by
the
side
of
his
vizier
inasmuch
as
it
was
far
more
dangerous
to
incur
the
displeasure
of
the
latter
than
profitable
to
gain
the
friendship
of
the
former
this
very
place
where
he
was
wont
to
be
adored
as
a
god
had
been
selected
for
the
dreadful
theatre
of
his
humiliation
with
a
careless
step
he
entered
the
circle
of
courtiers
who
as
unsuspicious
as
himself
of
what
was
to
follow
paid
their
usual
homage
awaiting
his
commands
after
a
short
interval
appeared
martinengo
accompanied
by
two
adjutants
no
longer
the
supple
cringing
smiling
courtier
but
overbearing
and
insolent
like
a
lackey
suddenly
raised
to
the
rank
of
a
gentleman
with
insolence
and
effrontery
he
strutted
up
to
the
prime
minister
and
confronting
him
with
his
head
covered
demanded
his
sword
in
the
prince
s
name
this
was
handed
to
him
with
a
look
of
silent
consternation
martinengo
resting
the
naked
point
on
the
ground
snapped
it
in
two
with
his
foot
and
threw
the
fragments
at
g
s
feet
at
this
signal
the
two
adjutants
seized
him
one
tore
the
order
of
the
cross
from
his
breast
the
other
pulled
off
his
epaulettes
the
facings
of
his
uniform
and
even
the
badge
and
plume
of
feathers
from
his
hat
during
the
whole
of
the
appalling
operation
which
was
conducted
with
incredible
speed
not
a
sound
nor
a
respiration
was
heard
from
more
than
five
hundred
persons
who
were
present
but
all
with
blanched
faces
and
palpitating
hearts
stood
in
deathlike
silence
around
the
victim
who
in
his
strange
disarray
a
rare
spectacle
of
the
melancholy
and
the
ridiculous
underwent
a
moment
of
agony
which
could
only
be
equalled
by
feelings
engendered
on
the
scaffold
thousands
there
are
who
in
his
situation
would
have
been
stretched
senseless
on
the
ground
by
the
first
shock
but
his
firm
nerves
and
unflinching
spirit
sustained
him
through
this
bitter
trial
and
enabled
him
to
drain
the
cup
of
bitterness
to
its
dregs
when
this
procedure
was
ended
he
was
conducted
through
rows
of
thronging
spectators
to
the
extremity
of
the
parade
where
a
covered
carriage
was
in
waiting
he
was
motioned
to
ascend
an
escort
of
hussars
being
to
attend
to
him
meanwhile
the
report
of
this
event
had
spread
through
the
whole
city
every
window
was
flung
open
every
street
lined
with
throngs
of
curious
spectators
who
pursued
the
carriage
shouting
his
name
amid
cries
of
scorn
and
malicious
exultation
or
of
commiseration
more
bitter
to
bear
than
either
at
length
he
cleared
the
town
but
here
a
no
less
fearful
trial
awaited
him
the
carriage
turned
out
of
the
high
road
into
a
narrow
unfrequented
path
a
path
which
led
to
the
gibbet
and
alongside
which
by
command
of
the
prince
he
was
borne
at
a
slow
pace
after
he
had
suffered
all
the
torture
of
anticipated
execution
the
carriage
turned
off
into
the
public
road
exposed
to
the
sultry
without
refreshment
or
human
consolation
he
passed
seven
dreadful
hours
in
journeying
to
the
place
of
destination
a
prison
fortress
it
was
nightfall
before
he
arrived
when
bereft
of
all
consciousness
more
dead
than
alive
his
giant
strength
having
at
length
yielded
to
twelve
hours
fast
and
consuming
thirst
he
was
dragged
from
the
carriage
and
on
regaining
his
senses
found
himself
in
a
horrible
subterraneous
vault
the
first
object
that
presented
itself
to
his
gaze
was
a
horrible
feebly
illuminated
by
a
few
rays
of
the
moon
which
forced
their
way
through
narrow
crevices
to
a
depth
of
nineteen
fathoms
at
his
side
he
found
a
coarse
loaf
a
jug
of
water
and
a
bundle
of
straw
for
his
couch
he
endured
this
situation
until
noon
the
ensuing
day
when
an
iron
wicket
in
the
centre
of
the
tower
was
opened
and
two
hands
were
seen
lowering
a
basket
containing
food
like
that
he
had
found
the
preceding
night
for
the
first
time
since
the
terrible
change
in
his
fortunes
did
pain
and
suspense
extort
from
him
a
question
or
two
why
was
he
brought
hither
what
offence
had
he
committed
but
he
received
no
answer
the
hands
disappeared
and
the
sash
was
closed
here
without
beholding
the
face
or
hearing
the
voice
of
a
without
the
least
clue
to
his
terrible
destiny
fearful
doubts
and
misgivings
overhanging
alike
the
past
and
the
future
cheered
by
no
rays
of
the
sun
and
soothed
by
no
refreshing
breeze
remote
alike
from
human
aid
and
human
compassion
here
in
this
frightful
abode
of
misery
he
numbered
four
hundred
and
ninety
long
and
mournful
days
which
he
counted
by
the
wretched
loaves
that
day
after
day
with
dreary
monotony
were
let
down
into
his
dungeon
but
a
discovery
which
he
one
day
made
early
in
his
confinement
filled
up
the
measure
of
his
affliction
he
recognized
the
place
it
was
the
same
which
he
himself
in
a
fit
of
unworthy
vengeance
against
a
deserving
officer
who
had
the
misfortune
to
displease
him
had
ordered
to
be
constructed
only
a
few
months
before
with
inventive
cruelty
he
had
even
suggested
the
means
by
which
the
horrors
of
captivity
might
be
aggravated
and
it
was
but
recently
that
he
had
made
a
journey
hither
in
order
personally
to
inspect
the
place
and
hasten
its
completion
what
added
the
last
bitter
sting
to
his
punishment
was
that
the
same
officer
for
whom
he
had
prepared
the
dungeon
an
aged
and
meritorious
colonel
had
just
succeeded
the
late
commandant
of
the
fortress
recently
deceased
and
from
having
been
the
victim
of
his
vengeance
had
become
the
master
of
his
fate
he
was
thus
deprived
of
the
last
melancholy
solace
the
right
of
compassionating
himself
and
of
accusing
destiny
hardly
as
it
might
use
him
of
injustice
to
the
acuteness
of
his
other
suffering
was
now
added
a
bitter
contempt
and
the
pain
which
to
a
sensitive
mind
is
the
severest
dependence
upon
the
generosity
of
a
foe
to
whom
he
had
shown
none
but
that
upright
man
was
too
to
take
a
mean
revenge
it
pained
him
deeply
to
enforce
the
severities
which
his
instructions
enjoined
but
as
an
old
soldier
accustomed
to
fulfil
his
orders
to
the
letter
with
blind
fidelity
he
could
do
no
more
than
pity
compassionate
the
unhappy
man
found
a
more
active
assistant
in
the
chaplain
of
the
garrison
who
touched
by
the
sufferings
of
the
prisoner
which
had
just
reached
his
ears
and
then
only
through
vague
and
confused
reports
instantly
took
a
firm
resolution
to
do
something
to
alleviate
them
this
excellent
man
whose
name
i
unwillingly
suppress
believed
he
could
in
no
way
better
fulfil
his
holy
vocation
than
by
bestowing
his
spiritual
support
and
consolation
upon
a
wretched
being
deprived
of
all
other
hopes
of
mercy
as
he
could
not
obtain
permission
from
the
commandant
himself
to
visit
him
he
repaired
in
person
to
the
capital
in
order
to
urge
his
suit
personally
with
the
prince
he
fell
at
his
feet
and
implored
mercy
for
the
unhappy
man
who
shut
out
from
the
consolations
of
christianity
a
privilege
from
which
even
the
greatest
crime
ought
not
to
debar
him
was
pining
in
solitude
and
perhaps
on
the
brink
of
despair
with
all
the
intrepidity
and
dignity
which
the
conscious
discharge
of
duty
inspires
he
entreated
nay
demanded
free
access
to
the
prisoner
whom
he
claimed
as
a
penitent
for
whose
soul
he
was
responsible
to
heaven
the
good
cause
in
which
he
spoke
made
him
eloquent
and
time
had
already
somewhat
softened
the
prince
s
anger
he
granted
him
permission
to
visit
the
prisoner
and
administer
to
his
spiritual
wants
after
a
lapse
of
sixteen
months
the
first
human
face
which
the
unhappy
g
beheld
was
that
of
his
new
benefactor
the
only
friend
he
had
in
the
world
he
owed
to
his
misfortunes
all
his
prosperity
had
gained
him
none
the
good
pastor
s
visit
was
like
the
appearance
of
an
angel
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
his
feelings
but
from
that
day
forth
his
tears
flowed
more
kindly
for
he
had
found
one
human
being
who
sympathized
with
and
compassionated
him
the
pastor
was
filled
with
horror
on
entering
the
frightful
vault
his
eyes
sought
a
human
form
but
beheld
creeping
towards
him
from
a
corner
opposite
which
resembled
rather
the
lair
of
a
wild
beast
than
the
abode
of
anything
human
a
monster
the
sight
of
which
made
his
blood
run
cold
a
ghastly
deathlike
skeleton
all
the
hue
of
life
perished
from
a
face
on
which
grief
and
despair
had
traced
deep
furrows
his
beard
and
nails
from
long
neglect
grown
to
a
frightful
clothes
rotten
and
hanging
about
him
in
tatters
and
the
air
he
breathed
for
want
of
ventilation
and
cleansing
foul
fetid
and
infectious
in
this
state
be
found
the
favorite
of
fortune
his
iron
frame
had
stood
proof
against
it
all
seized
with
horror
at
the
sight
the
pastor
hurried
back
to
the
governor
in
order
to
solicit
a
second
indulgence
for
the
poor
wretch
without
which
the
first
would
prove
of
no
avail
as
the
governor
again
excused
himself
by
pleading
the
imperative
nature
of
his
instructions
the
pastor
nobly
resolved
on
a
second
journey
to
the
capital
again
to
supplicate
the
prince
s
mercy
there
he
protested
solemnly
that
without
violating
the
sacred
character
of
the
sacrament
he
could
not
administer
it
to
the
prisoner
until
some
resemblance
of
the
human
form
was
restored
to
him
this
prayer
was
also
granted
and
from
that
day
forward
the
unfortunate
man
might
be
said
to
begin
a
new
existence
several
long
years
were
spent
by
him
in
the
fortress
but
in
a
much
more
supportable
condition
after
the
short
summer
of
the
new
favorite
s
reign
had
passed
and
others
succeeded
in
his
place
who
either
possessed
more
humanity
or
no
motive
for
revenge
at
length
after
ten
years
of
captivity
the
hour
of
his
delivery
arrived
but
without
any
judicial
investigation
or
formal
acquittal
he
was
presented
with
his
freedom
as
a
boon
of
mercy
and
was
at
the
same
time
ordered
to
quit
his
native
country
forever
here
the
oral
traditions
which
i
have
been
able
to
collect
respecting
his
history
begin
to
fail
and
i
find
myself
compelled
to
pass
in
silence
over
a
period
of
about
twenty
years
during
the
interval
g
entered
anew
upon
his
military
career
in
a
foreign
service
which
eventually
brought
him
to
a
pitch
of
greatness
quite
equal
to
that
from
which
he
had
in
his
native
country
been
so
awfully
precipitated
at
length
time
that
friend
of
the
unfortunate
who
works
a
slow
but
inevitable
retribution
took
into
his
hands
the
winding
up
of
this
affair
the
prince
s
days
of
passion
were
over
humanity
gradually
resumed
its
sway
over
him
as
his
hair
whitened
with
age
at
the
brink
of
the
grave
he
felt
a
yearning
towards
the
friend
of
his
early
youth
in
order
to
repay
as
far
as
possible
the
old
man
for
the
injuries
which
had
been
heaped
upon
the
youth
the
prince
with
friendly
expressions
invited
the
exile
to
revisit
his
native
land
towards
which
for
some
time
past
g
s
heart
had
secretly
yearned
the
meeting
was
extremely
trying
though
apparently
warm
and
cordial
as
if
they
had
only
separated
a
few
days
before
the
prince
looked
earnestly
at
his
favorite
as
if
trying
to
recall
features
so
well
known
to
him
and
yet
so
strange
he
appeared
as
if
numbering
the
deep
furrows
which
he
had
himself
so
cruelly
traced
there
he
looked
searchingly
in
the
old
man
s
face
for
the
beloved
features
of
the
youth
but
found
not
what
he
sought
the
welcome
and
the
look
of
mutual
confidence
were
evidently
forced
on
both
sides
shame
on
one
side
and
dread
on
the
other
had
forever
separated
their
hearts
a
sight
which
brought
back
to
the
prince
s
soul
the
full
sense
of
his
guilty
precipitancy
could
not
be
gratifying
to
him
while
g
felt
that
he
could
no
longer
love
the
author
of
his
misfortunes
comforted
nevertheless
and
in
tranquillity
he
looked
back
upon
the
past
as
the
remembrance
of
a
fearful
dream
in
a
short
time
g
was
reinstated
in
all
his
former
dignities
and
the
prince
smothered
his
feelings
of
secret
repugnance
by
showering
upon
him
the
most
splendid
favors
as
some
indemnification
for
the
past
but
could
he
also
restore
to
him
the
heart
which
he
had
forever
untuned
for
the
enjoyment
of
life
could
he
restore
his
years
of
hope
or
make
even
a
shadow
of
reparation
to
the
stricken
old
man
for
what
he
had
stolen
from
him
in
the
days
of
his
youth
for
nineteen
years
g
continued
to
enjoy
this
clear
unruffled
evening
of
his
days
neither
misfortune
nor
age
had
been
able
to
quench
in
him
the
fire
of
passion
nor
wholly
to
obscure
the
genial
humor
of
his
character
in
his
seventieth
year
he
was
still
in
pursuit
of
the
shadow
of
a
happiness
which
he
had
actually
possessed
in
his
twentieth
he
at
length
died
governor
of
the
fortress
where
state
prisoners
are
confined
one
would
naturally
have
expected
that
towards
these
he
would
have
exercised
a
humanity
the
value
of
which
he
had
been
so
thoroughly
taught
to
appreciate
in
his
own
person
but
he
treated
them
with
harshness
and
caprice
and
a
paroxysm
of
rage
in
which
he
broke
out
against
one
of
his
prisoners
laid
him
in
his
coffin
in
his
eightieth
year
