i
one
noon
in
a
young
man
stood
in
front
of
the
new
gewandhaus
in
leipzig
and
watched
the
neat
square
until
then
white
and
silent
in
the
sunshine
grow
dark
with
many
figures
the
public
rehearsal
of
the
weekly
concert
was
just
over
and
from
the
half
light
of
the
hall
which
for
more
than
two
hours
had
held
them
secluded
some
hundreds
of
people
hastened
with
renewed
anticipation
towards
sunlight
and
street
sounds
there
was
a
medley
of
tongues
for
many
nationalities
were
represented
in
the
crowd
that
surged
through
the
and
out
of
the
glass
doors
and
much
noisy
ado
for
the
majority
was
made
up
of
young
people
at
an
age
that
enjoys
the
sound
of
its
own
voice
in
black
diverging
lines
they
poured
through
the
heavy
swinging
doors
which
flapped
ceaselessly
to
and
fro
never
quite
closing
always
opening
afresh
and
on
descending
the
shallow
steps
they
told
off
into
groups
where
all
talked
at
once
with
lively
gesticulation
a
few
faces
had
the
strained
look
that
indicates
the
conscientious
listener
but
most
of
these
young
musicians
were
under
the
influence
of
a
stimulant
more
potent
than
wine
which
manifested
itself
in
a
nervous
garrulity
and
a
nervous
mirth
they
hummed
like
bees
before
a
hive
maurice
guest
who
had
come
out
among
the
first
lingered
to
watch
a
scene
that
was
new
to
him
of
which
he
was
as
yet
an
onlooker
only
here
and
there
came
a
member
of
the
orchestra
with
or
in
hand
he
deftly
threaded
his
way
through
the
throng
bestowing
as
he
went
a
hasty
nod
of
greeting
upon
a
colleague
a
sweep
of
the
hat
on
an
obsequious
pupil
the
crowd
began
to
disperse
and
to
overflow
in
the
surrounding
streets
some
of
the
stragglers
loitered
to
swell
the
group
that
was
forming
round
the
back
entrance
to
the
building
here
the
belgian
violinist
would
appear
the
wonders
of
whose
technique
had
sent
thrills
of
enthusiasm
through
his
hearers
and
whose
close
proximity
would
presently
affect
them
in
precisely
the
same
way
others
again
made
off
not
for
the
town
with
its
prosaic
suggestion
of
work
and
confinement
but
for
the
freedom
of
the
woods
that
lay
beyond
maurice
guest
followed
them
it
was
a
blowy
day
in
early
spring
round
white
masses
of
cloud
moved
lightly
across
a
deep
blue
sky
and
the
trees
still
thin
and
naked
bent
their
heads
and
shook
their
branches
as
if
to
elude
the
gambols
of
a
boisterous
playfellow
the
sun
shone
vividly
with
restored
power
and
though
the
clouds
sometimes
passed
over
his
very
face
the
shadows
only
lasted
for
a
moment
and
each
returning
radiance
seemed
brighter
than
the
one
before
in
the
pure
breath
of
the
wind
as
it
gustily
swept
the
earth
was
a
promise
of
things
vernal
of
the
tender
beauties
of
a
coming
spring
but
there
was
still
a
keen
delightful
freshness
in
the
air
a
vague
reminder
of
frosty
starlights
and
serene
white
snow
the
untrodden
snow
of
deserted
streets
that
quickened
the
blood
and
sent
a
craving
for
movement
through
the
veins
the
people
who
trod
the
broad
clean
roads
and
the
paths
of
the
wood
walked
with
a
spring
in
their
steps
voices
were
light
and
high
and
each
breath
that
was
drawn
increased
the
sense
of
buoyancy
of
undiluted
satisfaction
with
these
bursts
of
golden
sunshine
so
other
than
the
pallid
gleamings
of
the
winter
came
a
fresh
impulse
to
life
and
the
most
insensible
was
dimly
conscious
how
much
had
to
be
made
up
for
how
much
lived
into
such
a
day
maurice
guest
walked
among
the
mossgreen
each
of
which
vied
with
the
other
in
the
brilliancy
of
its
coating
he
was
under
the
sway
of
a
twofold
intoxication
great
music
and
a
day
rich
in
promise
from
the
flood
of
melody
that
had
broken
over
him
the
frenzied
storms
of
applause
he
had
come
out
not
into
a
lamplit
darkness
that
would
have
crushed
his
elation
back
upon
him
and
hemmed
it
in
but
into
the
spacious
lightness
of
a
fair
blue
day
where
all
that
he
felt
could
expand
as
a
flower
does
in
the
sun
his
walk
brought
him
to
a
broad
stream
which
flashed
through
the
wood
like
a
line
of
light
he
paused
on
a
suspension
bridge
and
leaning
over
the
railing
gazed
up
the
river
into
the
distance
at
the
horizon
and
its
trees
delicate
and
feathery
in
their
nakedness
against
the
sky
swollen
with
recent
rains
and
snows
the
water
came
hurrying
towards
him
the
of
the
little
river
which
meandering
in
from
the
country
through
pleasant
woods
in
ever
narrowing
curves
ran
through
the
town
as
a
small
stream
to
be
swelled
again
on
the
outskirts
by
the
waters
of
two
other
rivers
which
joined
it
at
right
angles
the
bridge
trembled
at
first
when
other
people
crossed
it
on
their
way
to
the
woods
that
lay
on
the
further
side
but
soon
the
last
stragglers
vanished
and
he
was
alone
as
he
looked
about
eager
to
discover
beauty
in
the
strip
of
landscape
that
stretched
before
him
the
line
of
water
its
banks
of
leafless
trees
he
was
instinctively
filled
with
a
desire
for
something
grander
for
a
feature
in
the
scene
that
would
answer
to
his
mood
there
where
the
water
appeared
to
end
in
a
clump
of
trees
there
should
be
mountains
a
gently
undulating
line
blue
with
the
unapproachable
blue
of
distance
and
high
enough
to
form
a
background
to
the
view
in
summer
heavy
with
haze
melting
into
the
sky
in
winter
lined
and
edged
with
snow
from
this
his
thoughts
sprang
back
to
the
music
he
had
heard
that
morning
all
the
vague
yet
eager
hopes
that
had
run
riot
in
his
brain
for
months
past
seemed
to
have
been
summed
up
and
made
clear
to
him
in
one
supreme
phrase
of
it
a
great
phrase
in
c
major
in
the
concluding
movement
of
beethoven
fifth
symphony
first
sounded
by
the
shrill
sweet
winds
it
had
suddenly
been
given
out
by
the
strings
in
magnificent
unison
and
had
mounted
up
and
on
to
the
jubilant
trilling
of
the
little
flutes
there
was
such
a
courageous
sincerity
in
this
theme
such
undauntable
resolve
it
expressed
more
plainly
than
words
what
he
intended
his
life
of
the
next
few
years
to
be
for
he
was
full
to
the
brim
of
ambitious
intentions
which
he
had
never
yet
had
a
chance
of
putting
into
practice
he
felt
so
ready
for
work
so
fresh
and
unworn
the
fervour
of
a
deep
enthusiasm
was
rampant
in
him
what
a
devotion
to
art
he
promised
himself
his
should
be
no
other
fancy
or
interest
should
share
his
heart
with
it
he
vowed
that
to
himself
this
day
when
he
stood
for
the
first
time
on
historic
ground
where
the
famous
musicians
of
the
past
had
found
inspiration
for
their
immortal
works
and
his
thoughts
spread
their
wings
and
circled
above
his
head
he
saw
himself
already
of
these
masters
craft
their
art
his
he
wrenching
ever
new
secrets
from
them
penetrating
the
recesses
of
their
genius
becoming
one
of
themselves
in
a
vision
as
vivid
as
those
that
cross
the
brain
in
a
sleepless
night
he
saw
a
dark
compact
multitude
wait
with
breath
suspended
to
catch
the
notes
that
fell
like
raindrops
from
his
fingers
saw
himself
the
figure
as
with
masterful
gestures
he
compelled
the
soul
that
lay
dormant
in
brass
and
strings
to
give
voice
to
to
interpret
to
the
many
his
subtlest
emotions
and
he
was
overcome
by
a
tremulous
compassion
with
himself
at
the
idea
of
wielding
such
power
over
an
unknown
multitude
at
the
latent
nobility
of
mind
and
aim
this
power
implied
even
when
swinging
back
to
the
town
he
had
not
shaken
himself
free
of
dreams
the
quiet
of
a
foreign
midday
lay
upon
the
streets
and
there
were
few
discordant
sounds
few
to
break
the
chain
of
his
thought
he
had
movement
silence
space
and
as
is
usual
with
dreamers
he
had
little
or
no
eye
for
the
real
life
about
him
he
was
not
struck
by
the
air
of
comfortable
prosperity
of
thriving
content
which
marked
the
great
commercial
centre
and
he
let
pass
unnoticed
the
unfamiliar
details
of
a
foreign
street
the
trifling
yet
significant
incidents
of
foreign
life
such
impressions
as
he
received
bore
the
stamp
of
his
own
mood
he
was
sensible
for
instance
in
face
of
the
picturesque
houses
that
clustered
together
in
the
centre
of
the
town
of
the
spiritual
gemutlichkeit
the
absence
of
any
pomp
or
pride
in
their
romantic
past
which
characterises
the
old
buildings
of
a
german
town
these
quaint
and
stately
houses
wedged
one
into
the
other
with
their
many
storeys
their
steeply
sloping
roofs
and
were
still
in
sympathetic
touch
with
the
trivial
life
of
the
day
which
swarmed
in
and
about
them
he
wandered
leisurely
along
the
narrow
streets
that
ran
at
all
angles
off
the
market
place
one
side
of
which
was
formed
by
the
gabled
rathaus
with
its
row
of
busy
little
shops
and
in
fancy
he
peopled
these
streets
with
the
renowned
figures
that
had
once
walked
them
he
looked
up
at
the
dark
old
houses
in
which
great
musicians
had
lived
died
and
been
born
and
he
saw
faces
that
he
recognised
lean
out
of
the
projecting
windows
to
watch
the
life
and
bustle
below
to
catch
the
last
sunbeam
that
filtered
in
he
saw
them
take
their
daily
walk
along
these
very
streets
in
the
antiquated
garments
of
their
time
they
passed
him
by
shadelike
and
misanthropic
and
seemed
to
steal
down
the
opposite
side
to
avoid
his
too
pertinent
gaze
bluff
preoccupied
his
keen
eyes
lowered
the
burly
cantor
passed
as
he
had
once
done
day
after
day
with
the
disciplined
regularity
of
high
genius
of
the
honest
citizen
to
his
appointed
work
in
the
shadows
of
the
behind
him
one
who
had
pointed
to
the
giant
with
a
new
burst
of
ardour
the
genial
little
improviser
whose
triumphs
had
been
those
of
this
town
whose
fascinating
gifts
and
still
more
fascinating
personality
had
made
him
the
lion
of
his
age
and
it
was
only
another
step
in
this
train
of
thought
that
before
a
large
lettered
poster
which
stood
out
black
and
white
against
the
reds
and
yellows
of
the
circular
and
bore
the
word
siegfried
maurice
guest
should
not
merely
be
filled
with
the
anticipation
of
a
world
of
beauty
still
unexplored
but
that
the
world
should
stand
to
him
for
a
symbol
as
it
were
of
the
easeful
and
luxurious
side
of
a
life
dedicated
to
art
of
a
fame
the
society
of
princes
kings
the
gloss
of
velvet
the
dull
glow
of
and
again
tapering
vistas
opened
up
through
which
he
could
peer
into
the
future
happy
in
the
knowledge
that
he
stood
firm
in
a
present
which
made
all
things
possible
to
a
holy
zeal
to
an
unhesitating
grasp
but
it
was
growing
late
and
he
slowly
retraced
his
steps
in
the
restaurant
into
which
he
turned
for
dinner
he
was
the
only
customer
the
principal
business
of
the
day
was
at
an
end
two
waiters
sat
dozing
in
corners
and
a
man
behind
the
counter
who
was
washing
had
almost
the
whole
pile
polished
bright
before
him
maurice
guest
sat
down
at
a
table
by
the
window
and
when
he
had
finished
his
dinner
and
lighted
a
cigarette
he
watched
the
who
crossed
the
pane
of
glass
like
the
figures
in
a
moving
photograph
suddenly
the
door
opened
with
an
energetic
click
and
a
lady
came
in
enveloped
in
an
circular
cloak
and
carrying
on
one
arm
a
pile
of
music
this
she
laid
on
the
table
next
that
at
which
the
young
man
was
sitting
then
took
off
her
hat
when
she
had
also
hung
up
the
unbecoming
cloak
he
saw
that
she
was
young
and
slight
for
the
rest
she
seemed
to
bring
with
her
into
the
warm
tranquil
atmosphere
of
the
place
heavy
with
midday
musings
a
breath
of
wind
and
outdoor
freshness
a
suggestion
that
was
heightened
by
the
quick
decisiveness
of
her
movements
the
briskness
with
which
she
divested
herself
of
her
wrappings
the
quick
smooth
of
the
hair
on
either
side
the
way
in
which
she
drew
up
her
chair
to
the
table
and
unfolded
her
napkin
she
seemed
to
be
no
stranger
there
for
on
her
entrance
the
younger
and
more
active
waiter
had
at
once
sprung
up
with
officious
haste
and
almost
before
she
was
ready
the
little
table
was
newly
spread
and
set
and
the
dinner
of
the
day
before
her
she
spoke
to
the
man
in
a
friendly
way
as
she
took
her
seat
and
he
replied
with
a
pleased
and
smiling
respect
then
she
began
to
eat
deliberately
and
with
an
overemphasised
nicety
as
she
carried
her
to
her
lips
maurice
guest
felt
that
she
was
observing
him
and
throughout
the
meal
of
which
she
ate
but
little
he
was
aware
of
a
peculiarly
straight
and
penetrating
gaze
it
ended
by
disconcerting
him
beckoning
the
waiter
he
went
through
the
business
of
paying
his
bill
and
this
done
was
about
to
push
back
his
chair
and
rise
to
his
feet
when
the
man
in
gathering
up
the
money
addressed
what
seemed
to
be
a
question
to
him
fearful
lest
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
the
strange
coinage
maurice
looked
up
apprehensively
the
waiter
repeated
his
words
but
the
slight
nervousness
that
gained
on
the
young
man
made
him
incapable
of
separating
the
syllables
which
were
indistinguishably
blurred
he
coloured
stuttered
and
felt
mortally
uncomfortable
as
for
the
third
time
the
waiter
repeated
his
remark
with
the
utmost
slowness
at
this
point
the
girl
at
the
adjacent
table
put
down
her
knife
and
fork
and
leaned
slightly
forward
excuse
me
she
said
and
smiled
the
waiter
only
said
he
thought
you
must
be
a
stranger
here
der
herr
ist
gewiss
fremd
in
leipzig
her
rather
prominent
teeth
were
visible
as
she
spoke
maurice
who
understood
instantly
her
pronunciation
of
the
words
was
not
set
any
more
at
his
ease
by
her
explanation
thanks
very
much
he
said
still
redder
than
usual
i
er
thought
the
fellow
was
saying
something
about
the
money
and
the
saxon
dialect
is
barbarous
is
it
she
added
kindly
but
perhaps
you
have
not
had
much
experience
of
it
yet
no
i
only
arrived
this
morning
at
this
she
opened
her
eyes
wide
why
you
are
a
courageous
person
she
said
and
laughed
but
did
not
explain
what
she
meant
and
he
did
not
like
to
ask
her
a
cup
of
coffee
was
set
on
the
table
before
her
she
held
a
lump
of
sugar
in
her
spoon
and
watched
it
grow
brown
and
dissolve
are
you
going
to
make
a
long
stay
she
asked
to
help
him
over
his
embarrassment
two
years
i
hope
said
the
young
man
music
she
queried
further
and
as
he
replied
affirmatively
then
the
con
of
course
an
enigmatic
question
that
needed
to
be
explained
you
piano
are
you
not
she
went
on
i
thought
so
it
is
hardly
possible
to
mistake
the
hands
here
she
just
glanced
at
her
own
which
large
white
and
well
formed
were
lying
on
the
table
with
strings
you
know
the
right
hand
is
as
a
rule
shockingly
defective
he
found
the
high
clearness
of
her
voice
very
agreeable
after
the
deep
roundnesses
of
german
and
could
have
gone
on
listening
to
it
but
she
was
brushing
the
crumbs
from
her
skirt
preparatory
to
rising
are
you
an
old
resident
here
he
queried
in
the
hope
of
detaining
her
yes
quite
i
at
the
end
of
my
second
year
and
do
know
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
she
answered
time
goes
like
a
now
look
here
as
one
who
knows
the

of
advice

the
public
examination

all
the
rest
the
people

the
bureau

said
eagerly

my
master
and
i
could
wish
for
a
better
but
bendel
is
good
too
in
his
way
and
is
much
sought
after
by
the
americans
you

you
well
the
english
colony
runs
the
american
close
nowadays

regular

foreigners

long
as

have
our
clubs
and
balls
and
other
social
functions
and
our
geniuses
and
our
masters

natives
but
there

soon
know
all
about
it
yourself
she
nodded
pleasantly
and
rose
i
must
be
off
she
said
every
minute
is
precious
that
wretched
probe
spoils
the
morning
and
directly
it
is
over
i
have
to
rush
to
an
that
why
i
here
for
i
ca
expect
a
pension
to
keep
dinner
hot
for
me
till
nearly
three
can
i
morning
rehearsals
are
a
mistake
what
you
were
there
too
really
after
a
night
in
the
train
well
you
did
get
much
did
you
for
your
energy
a
dull
aria
an
overture
that
in
the
theatre
as
they
say
here
an
indifferently
played
symphony
that
one
has
heard
at
least
a
dozen
times
and
for
us
poor
pianists
not
a
fresh
dish
this
season
nothing
but
yesterday
remains
heated
up
again
she
laughed
as
she
spoke
and
maurice
guest
laughed
too
not
being
able
at
the
moment
to
think
of
anything
to
say
getting
the
better
of
the
waiter
who
stood
by
napkin
on
arm
smiling
and
officious
he
helped
her
into
the
unbecoming
cloak
then
took
up
the
parcel
of
music
and
opened
the
door
in
his
manner
of
doing
this
there
may
have
been
a
touch
of
for
no
sooner
was
she
outside
than
she
quietly
took
the
music
from
him
and
without
even
offering
him
her
hand
said
a
friendly
but
curt
almost
before
he
had
time
to
return
it
he
saw
her
hurrying
up
the
street
as
though
she
had
never
vouchsafed
him
word
or
thought
the
abruptness
of
the
dismissal
left
him
breathless
in
his
imagination
they
had
walked
at
least
a
strip
of
the
street
together
he
stepped
off
the
pavement
into
the
road
that
he
might
keep
her
longer
in
sight
and
for
some
time
he
saw
her
head
in
the
hat
bobbing
along
above
the
heads
of
other
people
on
turning
again
he
found
that
the
waiter
was
watching
him
from
the
window
of
the
restaurant
and
it
seemed
to
the
young
man
that
the
pale
servile
face
wore
a
malicious
smile
with
the
feeling
of
disconcertion
that
springs
from
being
caught
in
an
impulsive
action
we
have
believed
unobserved
maurice
spun
round
on
his
heel
and
took
a
few
quick
steps
in
the
opposite
direction
when
once
he
was
out
of
range
of
the
window
however
he
dropped
his
pace
and
at
the
next
corner
stopped
altogether
he
would
at
least
have
liked
to
know
her
name
and
what
in
all
the
world
was
he
to
do
with
himself
now
clouds
had
gathered
the
airy
blue
and
whiteness
of
the
morning
had
become
a
level
sheet
of
grey
which
wiped
the
colour
out
of
everything
the
wind
no
longer
tempered
by
the
sun
was
chilly
as
it
whirled
down
the
narrow
streets
and
freaked
about
the
corners
there
was
little
temptation
now
to
linger
on
one
steps
but
maurice
guest
was
loath
to
return
to
the
solitary
room
that
stood
to
him
for
home
to
shut
himself
up
with
himself
inside
four
walls
and
turning
up
his
coat
collar
he
began
to
walk
slowly
along
the
curved
grimmaischestrasse
but
the
streets
were
by
this
time
black
with
people
most
of
whom
came
hurrying
towards
him
brisk
and
bustling
and
gay
in
spite
of
the
prevailing
dullness
at
the
prospect
of
the
warm
familiar
evening
he
was
continually
obliged
to
step
off
the
pavement
into
the
road
to
allow
a
bunch
of
merry
chattering
girls
their
cheeks
coloured
by
the
wind
beneath
the
dark
fur
of
their
hats
or
a
line
of
gaudy
capped
thickset
students
to
pass
him
by
unbroken
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
more
frequently
off
the
pavement
than
on
it
he
began
to
feel
disconsolate
among
these
jovial
people
who
were
hastening
forward
with
such
spirit
to
some
end
and
he
had
not
gone
far
before
he
turned
down
a
side
street
to
be
out
of
their
way
vaguely
damped
by
his
environment
which
with
the
sun
retreat
had
lost
its
charm
he
gave
himself
up
to
his
own
thoughts
and
was
soon
busily
engaged
in
thinking
over
all
that
had
been
said
by
his
quondam
acquaintance
of
the
in
inventing
neatly
turned
phrases
and
felicitous
replies
he
walked
without
aim
in
a
leisurely
way
down
quiet
streets
quickly
across
big
thoroughfares
and
paid
no
attention
to
where
he
was
going
the
falling
darkness
made
the
quaint
streets
look
strangely
alike
it
gave
them
too
an
air
of
fantastic
unreality
the
dark
old
houses
marshalled
in
rows
on
either
side
stood
as
if
lost
in
contemplation
in
the
saddening
dusk
the
lighting
of
the
which
started
one
by
one
into
existence
and
the
conflict
with
the
fading
daylight
of
the
uneasily
beating
flame
that
was
swept
from
side
to
side
in
the
wind
like
a
woman
hair
these
things
made
his
surroundings
seem
still
shadowier
and
less
real
he
was
roused
from
his
reverie
by
finding
himself
on
what
was
apparently
the
outskirts
of
the
town
with
much
difficulty
he
made
his
way
back
but
he
was
still
far
from
certain
of
his
whereabouts
when
an
unexpected
turn
to
the
right
brought
him
out
on
the
spacious
augustusplatz
in
front
of
the
new
theatre
he
had
been
in
this
square
once
already
but
now
its
appearance
was
changed
the
big
buildings
that
flanked
it
were
lit
up
the
file
of
droschkes
waiting
for
fares
under
the
bare
trees
formed
a
dotted
line
of
lights
a
double
row
of
hanging
lamps
before
the
cafe
francais
made
the
corner
of
the
grimmaischestrasse
dazzling
to
the
eyes
and
now
too
the
massive
white
theatre
was
awake
as
well
lights
shone
from
all
its
high
windows
streamed
out
through
the
corinthian
columns
and
doorways
its
festive
air
was
inviting
after
his
twilight
wanderings
and
he
went
across
the
square
to
it
immediately
before
the
theatre
early
corners
stood
in
knots
and
chatted
programme
and
cried
and
sold
their
wares
people
came
hurrying
from
all
directions
as
to
a
magnet
hastily
they
ascended
the
low
steps
and
disappeared
beneath
the
portico
he
watched
until
the
last
had
vanished
only
he
was
left
he
again
was
the
outsider
and
now
as
he
stood
there
in
the
deserted
square
which
a
moment
before
had
been
so
animated
he
had
a
sudden
sinking
of
the
heart
he
was
seized
by
that
acute
sense
of
desolation
that
lies
in
wait
for
one
caught
by
nightfall
alone
in
a
strange
city
it
stirs
up
a
wild
longing
not
so
much
for
any
particular
spot
on
earth
as
for
some
familiar
hand
or
voice
to
take
the
edge
off
an
intolerable
loneliness
he
turned
and
walked
rapidly
back
to
the
small
hotel
near
the
railway
station
at
which
he
was
staying
until
he
found
lodgings
he
was
tired
out
and
for
the
first
time
became
thoroughly
conscious
of
this
but
the
depression
that
now
closed
in
upon
him
was
not
due
to
fatigue
alone
and
he
knew
it
in
sane
moments
such
as
the
present
when
neither
excitement
nor
enthusiasm
warped
his
judgment
he
was
under
no
illusion
about
himself
and
as
he
strode
through
the
darkness
he
admitted
that
all
day
long
he
had
been
cheating
himself
in
the
usual
way
he
understood
perfectly
that
it
was
by
no
means
a
matter
of
merely
stretching
out
his
hand
to
pluck
what
he
would
from
this
tree
that
waved
before
him
he
reminded
himself
with
some
bitterness
that
he
stood
an
unheralded
stranger
before
a
solidly
compact
body
of
things
and
people
on
which
he
had
not
yet
made
any
impression
it
was
the
old
story
he
played
at
expecting
a
ready
capitulation
of
the
whole
gods
and
men
and
at
the
same
time
was
only
too
well
aware
of
the
laborious
process
that
was
his
sole
means
of
entry
and
fellowship
again
to
instance
another
of
his
mental
follies
the
pains
he
had
been
at
to
take
possession
of
the
town
to
make
it
respond
to
his
forced
interpretation
of
it
in
reality
it
had
repelled
him
yes
he
was
chilled
to
the
heart
by
the
aloofness
of
this
foreign
town
to
which
not
a
single
tie
yet
bound
him
by
the
light
of
a
fluttering
candle
in
the
dingy
hotel
bedroom
he
sat
and
wrote
a
letter
briefly
announcing
his
safe
arrival
about
to
close
the
envelope
he
hesitated
and
then
unfolding
the
sheet
of
paper
again
added
a
few
lines
to
what
he
had
written
these
cost
him
more
trouble
than
all
the
rest
once
more
hearty
thanks
to
you
both
my
dear
parents
for
letting
me
have
my
own
way
i
hope
you
will
never
have
reason
to
regret
it
one
thing
at
least
i
can
promise
you
and
that
is
that
not
a
day
of
my
time
here
shall
be
wasted
or
misspent
you
have
not
i
know
the
same
faith
in
me
that
i
have
myself
and
this
has
often
been
a
bitter
thought
to
me
but
only
have
patience
something
stronger
than
myself
drove
me
to
it
and
if
i
am
to
succeed
anywhere
it
will
be
here
and
i
mean
to
succeed
if
human
will
can
do
it
he
threw
himself
on
the
creaking
wooden
bed
and
tried
to
sleep
but
his
brain
was
active
and
the
street
was
noisy
people
talked
late
in
the
adjoining
room
and
trod
heavily
in
the
one
above
it
was
long
after
midnight
before
the
house
was
still
and
he
fell
into
an
uneasy
sleep
towards
morning
he
had
a
strange
dream
from
which
he
wakened
in
a
cold
sweat
once
more
he
was
wandering
through
the
streets
as
he
had
done
the
previous
day
apparently
in
search
of
something
he
could
not
find
but
he
did
not
know
himself
what
he
sought
all
of
a
sudden
on
turning
a
corner
he
came
upon
a
crowd
of
people
gathered
round
some
object
in
the
road
and
at
once
said
to
himself
this
is
it
here
it
is
he
could
not
however
see
what
it
actually
was
for
the
people
who
were
muttering
to
themselves
in
angry
tones
strove
to
keep
him
back
at
all
costs
he
felt
he
must
get
nearer
to
the
mysterious
thing
and
in
a
spirit
of
bravado
he
was
pushing
through
the
crowd
to
reach
it
when
a
great
clamour
arose
every
one
sprang
back
and
fled
wildly
shrieking
moloch
moloch
he
did
not
know
in
the
least
what
it
meant
but
the
very
strangeness
of
the
word
added
to
the
horror
and
he
too
fled
with
the
rest
fled
blindly
desperately
up
streets
and
down
watched
it
seemed
to
him
from
every
window
by
a
cold
malignant
eye
but
never
daring
to
turn
his
head
lest
he
should
see
the
awful
thing
behind
him
fled
on
and
on
through
streets
that
grew
ever
vaguer
and
more
shadowy
till
at
last
his
feet
would
carry
him
no
further
he
sank
down
with
a
loud
cry
sank
down
down
down
and
wakened
to
find
that
he
was
sitting
up
in
bed
clammy
with
fear
and
that
dawn
was
stealing
in
at
the
sides
of
the
window
ii
in
maurice
guest
it
might
be
said
that
the
smouldering
unrest
of
two
generations
burst
into
flame
as
a
young
man
his
father
then
a
poor
teacher
in
a
small
provincial
town
had
been
a
prey
to
certain
dreams
and
wishes
which
harmonised
ill
with
the
conditions
of
his
life
when
for
example
on
a
mild
night
he
watched
the
moon
scudding
a
silvery
sky
when
white
clouds
sailed
swiftly
and
soft
spring
breezes
were
hastening
past
when
in
a
word
all
things
seemed
to
be
making
for
some
place
unknown
where
he
was
not
then
he
too
was
seized
with
a
desire
to
be
moving
to
strap
on
a
knapsack
and
be
gone
to
wander
through
foreign
countries
to
see
strange
cities
and
hear
strange
tongues
was
unconsciously
filled
with
the
desire
to
taste
lighthearted
irresponsible
the
joys
and
experiences
of
the
wanderjahre
before
settling
down
to
face
the
of
life
and
as
the
present
continually
pushed
the
realisation
of
his
dreams
into
the
future
he
satisfied
the
immediate
thirst
of
his
soul
by
playing
the
flute
and
by
breathing
into
the
thin
reedy
tones
he
drew
from
it
all
that
he
dreamed
of
but
would
never
know
for
he
presently
came
to
a
place
in
his
life
where
two
paths
diverged
and
he
was
forced
to
make
a
choice
between
them
it
was
characteristic
of
the
man
that
he
chose
the
way
of
least
resistance
and
having
married
more
or
less
improvidently
he
turned
his
back
on
the
visions
that
had
haunted
his
youth
afterwards
the
cares
great
and
small
that
came
in
the
train
of
the
years
drove
them
ever
further
into
the
background
want
of
sympathy
in
his
blunted
the
finer
edges
of
his
nature
of
a
gentle
and
yielding
disposition
he
took
on
the
commonplace
colour
of
his
surroundings
after
years
of
unhesitating
toil
it
is
true
the
most
pressing
material
needs
died
down
but
the
dreams
and
ambitions
had
died
too
never
to
come
again
and
as
it
is
in
the
nature
of
things
that
no
one
is
less
lenient
towards
romantic
longings
than
he
who
has
suffered
disappointment
in
them
who
has
failed
to
transmute
them
into
reality
so
in
this
case
the
first
tentative
leanings
to
a
wider
life
met
with
a
more
though
less
decisive
opposition
on
the
part
of
the
father
than
of
the
mother
but
maurice
guest
had
a
more
tenacious
hold
on
life
the
home
in
which
he
grew
up
was
one
of
those
cheerless
homes
across
which
never
passes
a
breath
of
the
great
gladness
the
ideal
beauty
of
life
where
thought
never
swings
itself
above
the
material
interests
of
the
day
gone
the
day
to
come
and
existence
grows
as
timid
and
trivial
as
the
petty
griefs
and
pleasures
that
intersperse
it
the
days
drip
past
one
by
one
like
water
from
a
spout
after
a
and
the
dull
monotony
of
them
benumbs
all
wholesome
temerity
at
its
core
maurice
guest
had
known
days
of
this
kind
for
before
the
irksomeness
of
the
was
well
behind
him
he
had
begun
his
training
as
a
teacher
and
as
soon
as
he
had
learnt
how
to
instil
his
own
knowledge
into
the
minds
of
others
he
received
a
small
post
in
the
school
at
which
his
father
taught
the
latter
had
for
some
time
secretly
cherished
a
wish
to
send
the
boy
to
study
at
the
neighbouring
university
to
make
a
scholar
of
his
eldest
son
but
the
longer
he
waited
the
more
unfavourable
did
circumstances
seem
and
the
idea
finally
died
before
it
was
born
maurice
guest
looked
back
on
the
four
years
he
had
just
come
through
with
bitterness
and
it
was
only
later
when
he
was
engrossed
heart
and
soul
in
congenial
work
that
he
began
to
recognise
and
be
vaguely
grateful
for
the
spirit
of
order
with
which
they
had
familiarised
him
at
first
he
could
not
recall
them
without
an
aversion
that
was
almost
physical
this
regularity
which
in
its
disregard
of
mood
and
feeling
had
something
of
a
divine
callousness
to
human
stirrings
the
jarring
contact
with
people
his
inadequacy
and
distaste
for
a
task
that
grew
day
by
day
more
painful
his
own
knowledge
was
so
hesitating
so
uncertain
too
slight
for
just
too
much
and
too
fresh
to
allow
him
to
generalise
with
the
unthinking
assurance
that
was
demanded
of
him
yet
had
anyone
he
asked
himself
more
obstacles
to
overcome
than
he
in
his
efforts
to
set
himself
free
this
silent
undemonstrative
father
who
surrounded
himself
with
an
unscalable
wall
of
indifference
this
careworn
mother
about
whose
mouth
the
years
had
traced
deep
lines
and
for
whom
in
the
course
of
a
battle
with
life
the
true
reality
had
come
to
be
success
or
failure
in
the
struggle
for
bread
what
was
art
to
them
but
an
empty
name
a
pastime
for
the
drones
and
idlers
of
existence
how
could
he
set
up
his
ambitions
before
them
to
be
bowled
over
like
so
many
ninepins
when
at
length
after
much
heartburning
and
conscientious
scrupling
he
was
mastered
by
a
healthier
spirit
of
which
made
him
rebel
against
the
uselessness
of
the
conflict
and
doggedly
resolve
to
put
an
end
to
it
he
was
only
enabled
to
stand
firm
by
summoning
to
his
aid
all
the
strengthening
egoism
which
is
latent
in
every
more
or
less
artistic
nature
to
the
mother
in
her
honest
narrowness
the
son
choice
of
a
calling
which
she
held
to
be
unfitting
was
something
of
a
tragedy
she
allowed
no
item
of
her
duty
to
escape
her
and
moved
about
the
house
as
usual
sternly
observant
of
her
daily
task
but
her
lips
were
compressed
to
a
thin
line
and
her
face
reflected
the
anger
that
burnt
in
her
heart
too
deep
for
speech
in
the
months
that
followed
maurice
learnt
that
the
censure
hardest
to
meet
is
that
which
is
never
put
into
words
which
refuses
to
argue
or
discuss
he
chafed
inwardly
against
the
unspoken
opposition
that
will
not
come
out
to
be
grappled
with
and
overthrown
and
as
he
was
only
too
keenly
aware
there
was
more
to
be
faced
than
a
mere
determined
aversion
to
the
independence
with
which
he
had
struck
out
there
was
in
the
first
place
a
pardonably
human
sense
of
aggrievedness
that
the
should
cross
their
plans
and
wishes
that
after
the
care
and
thought
they
had
bestowed
on
him
he
should
demand
fresh
efforts
from
them
and
again
most
harassing
of
all
and
most
invulnerable
such
an
entire
want
of
faith
in
the
powers
he
was
yearning
to
test
the
prophet
lot
in
the
mean
blindness
of
the
family
that
at
times
it
threatened
to
shake
his
faith
in
but
before
the
winter
drew
to
a
close
he
was
away
away
to
go
out
into
the
world
and
be
a
musician
that
was
his
longing
and
his
dream
and
he
never
came
to
quite
an
honest
understanding
with
himself
on
this
point
for
desire
and
dream
were
interwoven
in
his
mind
he
could
not
separate
the
one
from
the
other
but
when
he
weighed
them
and
allowed
them
to
rise
up
and
take
shape
before
him
it
was
invariably
in
this
order
that
they
did
so
in
reality
although
he
himself
was
but
vaguely
conscious
of
the
fact
it
was
to
some
extent
as
means
to
an
end
that
when
his
eyes
had
been
opened
to
its
presence
he
clutched
like
a
drowning
man
who
seizes
upon
a
spar
clutched
and
held
fast
to
his
talent
but
the
necessary
insight
into
his
powers
had
first
to
be
gained
for
it
was
not
one
of
those
talents
which
from
the
beginning
strut
their
little
world
with
the
assurance
of
the
peacock
he
was
it
is
true
gifted
with
an
instinctive
feeling
for
the
value
and
significance
of
tones
as
a
child
he
sang
by
ear
in
a
small
sweet
voice
which
gained
him
the
only
notice
he
received
at
school
and
he
easily
picked
out
his
notes
and
taught
himself
little
pieces
on
the
piano
which
had
belonged
to
his
mother
as
a
girl
and
at
which
in
the
early
days
of
her
marriage
she
had
sung
in
a
high
shrill
voice
the
sentimental
songs
of
her
youth
but
here
for
want
of
incentive
matters
remained
maurice
was
kept
close
at
his
and
boylike
he
had
no
ambition
to
distinguish
himself
in
a
field
so
different
from
that
in
which
his
comrades
won
their
spurs
it
was
only
when
with
the
end
of
his
schooldays
in
sight
he
was
putting
away
childish
things
that
he
seriously
turned
his
attention
to
the
piano
and
his
hands
they
were
those
of
the
pianist
broad
strong
and
supple
and
the
new
occupation
soon
engrossed
him
deeply
he
gave
up
all
his
spare
time
to
it
and
in
a
few
months
attained
so
creditable
a
proficiency
that
he
went
through
a
course
of
instruction
with
a
local
teacher
of
music
who
scenting
talent
dismissed
preliminaries
with
the
assurance
of
his
kind
and
initiated
his
pupil
into
all
that
is
false
and
meretricious
in
the
literature
of
the
piano
the
cheaply
pathetic
the
tinsel
of
transcription
the
titillating
melancholy
of
slavonic
to
leave
him
but
for
an
increased
agility
of
finger
not
a
whit
further
forward
than
he
had
found
him
then
followed
months
when
the
phantom
of
discontent
stalked
large
through
maurice
life
grew
indeed
day
by
day
more
tangible
more
easily
defined
for
there
came
the
long
restless
summer
evenings
when
it
seemed
as
if
a
tranquil
darkness
would
never
fall
and
bar
off
the
distant
the
unattainable
and
as
he
followed
some
flat
white
country
road
that
was
lost
to
sight
on
the
horizon
as
a
tapering
line
or
looked
out
across
a
stretch
of
low
luxuriant
meadows
the
very
placidity
of
which
made
heart
and
blood
throb
quicker
in
a
sense
of
opposition
then
the
desire
to
have
finished
with
the
life
he
knew
grew
almost
intolerable
and
only
a
spark
was
needed
to
set
his
resolve
ablaze
it
was
one
evening
when
the
summer
had
already
dragged
itself
to
a
close
that
maurice
walked
through
a
drizzling
rain
to
the
neighbouring
cathedral
town
to
attend
a
performance
of
elijah
it
was
the
first
important
musical
experience
of
his
life
and
carried
away
by
the
volumes
of
sound
he
repressed
his
agitation
so
ill
that
it
became
apparent
to
his
neighbour
a
small
wizened
old
man
who
was
leaning
forward
his
hands
hanging
between
his
knees
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
alternately
shaking
and
nodding
his
head
in
the
interval
between
the
parts
they
exchanged
a
few
words
halting
excited
on
maurice
part
interrogative
on
his
companion
when
the
performance
was
over
they
walked
a
part
of
the
way
together
and
found
so
much
to
say
that
often
after
this
when
his
week
work
was
behind
him
maurice
would
cover
the
intervening
miles
for
the
pleasure
of
a
few
hours
conversation
with
this
new
friend
in
a
small
dark
room
the
air
of
which
was
saturated
with
he
learned
by
degrees
the
story
of
the
old
musician
life
how
some
thirty
years
previously
he
had
drifted
into
the
midst
of
this
provincial
population
where
he
found
it
easy
to
earn
enough
for
his
needs
and
where
his
position
was
below
that
of
a
but
how
long
ago
in
his
youth
that
youth
of
which
he
spoke
with
a
tone
in
his
voice
and
at
which
he
seemed
to
be
looking
out
as
at
a
fading
shore
it
had
been
his
intention
to
perfect
himself
as
a
pianist
life
had
been
against
him
when
the
resolve
was
strongest
poverty
and
kept
him
down
and
since
then
with
the
years
that
passed
he
had
come
to
see
that
his
place
would
only
have
been
among
the
multitude
of
little
talents
whose
destiny
it
is
to
imitate
and
vulgarise
the
strivings
of
genius
to
swell
the
mass
of
mediocrity
and
so
he
had
chosen
that
his
life
should
be
a
failure
a
failure
that
is
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
for
himself
he
judged
otherwise
the
truth
that
could
be
extracted
from
words
was
such
a
fluctuating
relative
truth
failure
success
what
was
success
but
a
clinging
fast
unabashed
by
smile
or
neglect
to
that
better
part
in
art
in
one
self
that
can
not
be
taken
away
never
for
a
thought
space
being
untrue
to
the
ideal
each
one
of
us
bears
in
his
breast
never
yielding
jot
or
tittle
to
the
world
opinion
that
was
what
it
meant
and
he
who
was
proudly
conscious
of
having
succeeded
thus
could
well
afford
to
regard
the
lives
of
others
as
and
imperfect
he
alone
was
at
one
with
himself
his
life
alone
was
a
harmonious
whole
to
maurice
guest
all
this
mattered
little
or
not
at
all
it
was
merely
the
unavoidable
introduction
the
chief
thing
was
that
the
old
man
had
known
the
world
which
maurice
so
desired
to
know
he
had
seen
life
had
lived
much
of
his
youth
in
foreign
lands
and
had
the
conversation
been
skilfully
set
agoing
in
this
direction
he
would
lay
a
wrinkled
hand
on
his
listener
shoulder
and
tell
him
of
this
shadowy
past
with
short
hoarse
chuckles
of
pleasure
and
reminiscence
which
invariably
ended
in
a
cough
he
painted
it
in
vivid
colours
and
with
the
unconscious
heightening
of
effect
that
comes
natural
to
one
who
looks
back
upon
a
happy
past
from
which
the
countless
pricks
and
stings
that
make
up
reality
have
faded
leaving
in
their
place
a
sense
of
dreamy
unreal
brightness
like
that
of
sunset
upon
distant
hills
he
told
him
of
germany
and
the
gay
careless
years
he
had
spent
there
working
at
his
art
years
of
inspiriting
untrammelled
progress
told
him
of
famous
musicians
he
had
seen
and
known
of
great
theatre
performances
at
which
he
had
assisted
of
stirring
premieres
long
since
forgotten
of
burning
youthful
enthusiasms
of
nights
sleepless
with
holy
excitement
and
days
of
fruitful
meditative
idleness
under
the
spell
of
these
reminiscences
he
seemed
to
come
into
touch
again
with
life
and
his
eyes
lit
with
a
spark
of
the
old
fire
at
moments
he
forgot
his
companion
altogether
and
gazed
long
and
silently
before
him
nodding
and
smiling
to
himself
at
the
memories
he
had
stirred
up
in
his
brain
memories
of
things
that
had
long
ceased
to
be
of
people
who
had
long
been
quiet
and
unassertive
beneath
their
handful
of
earth
but
for
whom
alone
the
brave
fair
world
had
once
seemed
to
exist
then
he
would
lose
himself
among
strange
names
in
vague
histories
of
those
who
had
borne
these
names
and
of
what
they
had
become
in
their
subsequent
journeyings
towards
the
light
for
which
they
had
set
out
side
by
side
with
so
much
ardour
and
oftenest
what
he
had
to
tell
was
a
modest
mediocrity
but
the
greater
number
of
them
had
lost
sight
one
of
the
other
the
most
inseparable
friends
had
once
parted
soon
forgotten
and
the
bluish
smoke
sent
upwards
as
he
talked
in
clouds
and
spirals
that
mounted
rapidly
and
vanished
seemed
to
maurice
symbolic
of
the
brief
and
shadowy
lives
that
were
unrolled
before
him
but
after
all
this
when
the
lights
came
the
piano
was
opened
and
then
for
an
hour
or
two
the
world
was
forgotten
in
a
different
way
it
was
here
that
the
chief
landmarks
of
music
emerged
from
the
mists
in
which
for
maurice
they
had
hitherto
been
enveloped
here
he
learned
that
bach
and
beethoven
were
giants
and
made
uncertain
efforts
at
appreciation
learnt
that
gluck
was
a
great
composer
mozart
a
genius
of
many
parts
mendelssohn
the
direct
successor
in
this
line
of
kings
sonatas
symphonies
operas
were
hammered
out
with
tremendous
force
and
precision
on
the
harsh
scrupulously
tuned
piano
and
all
were
dominated
alike
by
the
hoarse
voice
of
the
old
man
who
never
wavered
never
faltered
but
sang
from
beginning
to
end
with
all
his
might
each
one
of
the
pleasant
hours
spent
in
this
new
world
helped
to
deepen
maurice
resolution
to
free
himself
while
there
was
yet
time
each
one
gave
more
clearness
and
precision
to
his
somewhat
formless
desires
for
in
all
that
concerned
his
art
the
nameless
old
musician
hated
his
native
land
with
the
hatred
of
the
bigot
for
those
who
are
hostile
or
indifferent
to
his
faith
with
a
long
and
goal
in
sight
a
goal
towards
which
our
hearts
in
joyous
eagerness
have
already
leapt
out
it
is
astonishing
how
easy
it
becomes
to
make
light
of
the
last
monotonous
stretch
of
road
that
remains
to
be
travelled
is
there
not
just
beyond
a
and
cool
green
shadows
events
and
circumstances
which
had
hitherto
loomed
forth
gigantic
threatening
to
crush
now
appeared
to
maurice
trivial
and
of
little
moment
he
saw
them
in
other
proportions
now
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
no
longer
in
their
midst
he
stood
above
them
and
overlooked
them
and
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
a
starry
future
he
joyfully
prepared
himself
for
his
new
life
what
is
more
those
around
him
helped
him
to
this
altered
view
of
things
for
as
the
present
marched
steadily
upon
the
future
devouring
as
it
went
as
the
departure
this
future
contained
took
on
the
shape
of
a
fact
the
countless
details
of
which
called
for
attention
it
began
to
be
accepted
as
even
the
most
unpalatable
facts
in
the
long
run
usually
are
with
an
ungracious
resignation
in
face
of
the
inevitable
thus
with
all
his
ardour
to
be
gone
maurice
guest
came
to
see
the
last
stage
of
his
almost
in
a
bright
light
and
even
with
a
touch
of
melancholy
as
something
that
was
fast
slipping
from
him
never
to
be
there
in
all
its
entirety
exactly
as
it
now
was
again
the
last
calm
hour
of
respite
before
he
plunged
into
the
triumphs
but
also
into
the
tossings
and
agitations
of
the
future
iii
it
was
april
and
a
day
such
as
april
will
sometimes
bring
one
of
those
days
when
the
air
is
full
of
a
new
mysterious
fragrance
when
the
sunshine
lies
like
a
flood
upon
the
earth
and
high
clouds
hang
motionless
in
the
blue
a
day
at
the
very
heels
of
which
it
would
seem
that
summer
was
lurking
maurice
guest
stood
at
his
window
both
sides
of
which
were
flung
open
drinking
in
the
warm
air
and
gazing
absently
up
at
the
stretch
of
sky
against
which
the
dark
of
the
houses
opposite
stood
out
abruptly
his
hands
were
in
his
pockets
and
to
a
light
beat
of
the
foot
he
hummed
softly
to
himself
but
what
he
could
not
have
told
whether
some
fragment
of
melody
that
had
lingered
in
a
niche
of
his
brain
and
now
came
to
his
lips
or
whether
a
mere
audible
expression
of
his
mood
the
strong
unreal
sun
of
the
afternoon
was
just
beginning
to
reach
the
house
it
slanted
in
golden
by
the
side
of
the
window
and
threw
on
the
wall
above
the
piano
a
single
long
bar
of
light
he
leaned
over
and
looked
down
into
the
street
far
below
still
no
one
there
but
it
was
only
four
he
stretched
himself
long
and
luxuriously
as
if
by
doing
so
he
would
get
rid
of
a
restlessness
which
arose
from
repressed
physical
energy
and
also
from
an
impatience
to
be
more
keenly
conscious
of
life
to
feel
it
as
it
were
quicken
in
him
not
unakin
to
that
passionate
impulse
towards
perfection
which
was
urging
on
the
sap
and
loosening
firm
green
buds
he
had
a
day
imprisonment
behind
him
and
all
spring
magic
was
at
work
to
ferment
his
blood
how
small
and
close
the
room
was
he
leaned
out
on
the
sill
as
far
out
as
he
could
in
the
sun
it
was
shining
full
down
the
street
now
gilding
the
river
at
the
foot
and
throwing
over
the
tall
dingy
houses
on
the
opposite
side
a
tawdry
brightness
which
unlike
that
of
the
morning
with
its
suggestion
of
dewy
shade
only
served
to
bring
out
the
shabbiness
of
broken
plaster
and
paintless
window
a
shamefaced
yet
aggressive
shabbiness
where
doorways
and
wide
entries
spoke
to
better
days
and
also
to
a
subsequent
decay
now
openly
admitted
in
the
little
placards
which
dotted
them
here
and
there
bearing
the
words
garcon
logis
and
dangling
bravely
yellow
from
the
windows
of
the
cheap
lodgings
they
proclaimed
vacant
it
was
very
still
the
hoarse
voice
of
a
crying
his
wares
in
the
adjoining
streets
was
to
be
heard
at
intervals
but
each
time
less
distinctly
and
from
the
distance
came
the
faint
tones
of
a
single
piano
how
different
it
was
in
the
morning
then
if
pausing
a
moment
from
his
work
he
opened
the
window
and
leaned
out
for
a
brief
refreshment
what
a
delightful
confusion
of
sounds
met
his
ear
pianos
rolled
noisily
up
and
down
ploughing
one
through
the
other
beating
one
against
the
other
key
to
key
rhythm
to
rhythm
each
in
a
clamorous
despair
at
being
unable
to
raise
its
voice
above
the
rest
at
having
to
form
part
of
this
jumble
of
discord
some
so
near
at
hand
or
so
directly
opposite
that
none
the
less
it
was
occasionally
possible
to
follow
them
through
the
persistent
reiterations
of
a
fugue
or
through
some
brilliant
glancing
etude
the
notes
of
which
flew
off
like
sparks
others
further
away
of
which
were
audible
only
the
convulsive
treble
outbursts
and
the
toneless
rumblings
of
the
bass
now
and
then
cut
shrilly
through
by
the
piercing
sharpness
of
a
violin
now
and
then
at
quieter
moments
borne
up
and
accompanied
by
the
deep
guttural
tones
of
a
neighbouring
violoncello
this
was
always
discovered
at
work
upon
scales
uncertain
hesitating
scales
on
the
lower
strings
and
heard
suddenly
after
the
other
instruments
genial
hubbub
it
sounded
like
some
inarticulate
animal
making
uncouth
attempts
at
expression
at
rare
intervals
there
came
a
lull
and
then
before
all
burst
forth
again
together
or
fell
in
one
by
one
a
single
piano
or
the
violin
would
like
a
solo
voice
in
a
symphony
bear
the
whole
burden
or
if
the
wind
were
in
the
west
it
would
sometimes
carry
over
with
it
from
the
woods
on
the
left
the
mournful
notes
of
a
french
horn
which
some
unskilful
player
had
gone
out
to
practise
this
was
that
new
world
of
which
he
was
now
a
part
into
which
he
had
been
so
auspiciously
received
yes
the
beginning
and
the
thousand
petty
disquiets
that
go
with
beginnings
were
behind
him
he
had
made
a
start
and
he
believed
a
good
one
thanks
to
dove
he
was
really
grateful
to
dove
a
chance
acquaintance
formed
on
one
of
those
early
days
when
he
loitered
timid
and
unsure
about
the
bureau
of
the
conservatorium
dove
had
taken
him
up
with
what
struck
even
the
grateful
as
extraordinary
going
deliberately
out
of
his
way
to
be
of
service
to
him
meeting
him
at
every
turn
with
assistance
and
advice
it
was
dove
who
had
helped
him
over
the
embarrassments
of
the
examination
it
was
through
dove
influence
that
he
had
obtained
a
private
interview
with
schwarz
and
in
dove
opinion
schwarz
was
the
only
master
in
leipzig
under
whom
it
was
worth
while
to
study
the
only
one
who
could
be
relied
on
to
give
the
exhaustive
technique
that
was
indispensable
without
in
the
process
destroying
what
was
of
infinitely
more
account
the
individuality
the
temperament
of
the
student
this
and
more
dove
set
forth
at
some
length
in
their
conversations
then
warming
to
his
work
he
would
go
further
would
go
on
to
speak
of
phrasings
and
interpretations
of
an
artistic
use
of
the
pedals
and
the
legitimate
participation
of
the
emotions
of
the
confines
of
absolute
music
as
touched
in
the
ninth
symphony
would
refer
incidentally
to
schopenhauer
and
make
wagner
his
authority
using
terms
that
were
new
to
his
hearer
and
now
and
then
by
way
of
emphasis
bringing
his
palm
down
flat
and
noiselessly
upon
the
it
had
not
taken
them
long
to
become
friends
of
the
same
age
with
similar
aims
and
interests
they
had
soon
slipped
into
one
of
the
friendships
of
youth
a
quarter
to
five
as
the
strokes
from
the
neighbouring
church
clock
died
away
the
melody
of
siegfried
horn
was
whistled
up
from
the
street
and
looking
over
maurice
saw
his
friend
he
seized
his
music
and
went
hastily
down
the
four
flights
of
stairs
they
crossed
the
river
and
came
to
newer
streets
it
was
delightful
a
light
breeze
met
them
as
they
turned
and
a
few
ragged
fleecy
clouds
that
it
was
driving
up
only
made
the
sky
seem
bluer
the
two
young
men
walked
leisurely
laughing
and
talking
rather
loudly
maurice
guest
had
already
in
dress
and
bearing
taken
on
a
touch
of
musicianly
disorder
but
dove
lengthier
residence
had
left
no
trace
upon
him
he
might
have
stepped
that
day
from
the
streets
of
the
provincial
english
town
to
which
he
belonged
his
well
brushed
clothes
sat
with
an
easy
inelegance
his
tie
was
small
his
linen
clean
and
the
only
concession
he
made
to
his
surroundings
the
soft
felt
hat
looked
oddly
out
of
place
on
his
hair
he
carried
himself
erectly
swinging
a
little
on
his
hips
as
they
went
he
passed
in
review
the
important
items
of
the
day
had
strained
a
muscle
had
spoilt
a
second
piano
but
his
particular
interest
centred
upon
that
abendunterhaltung
a
man
named
schilsky
whom
it
was
no
exaggeration
to
call
their
finest
very
finest
violinist
was
to
play
concerto
in
dove
all
but
smacked
his
lips
as
he
spoke
of
it
in
reply
to
a
query
from
maurice
he
declared
with
vehemence
that
this
schilsky
was
a
genius
although
so
great
a
violinist
he
could
play
almost
every
other
instrument
with
case
his
memory
had
become
a
his
compositions
were
already
famous
at
the
present
moment
he
was
said
to
be
at
work
upon
a
symphonic
poem
having
for
its
base
a
new
and
extraordinary
book
half
poetry
half
philosophy
a
book
which
he
dove
could
confidently
assert
would
effect
a
revolution
in
human
thought
but
of
which
just
at
the
minute
he
was
unable
to
remember
the
name
infected
by
his
friend
enthusiasm
maurice
here
recalled
having
only
the
day
before
met
some
one
who
answered
to
description
the
genial
pole
had
been
storming
up
the
steps
of
the
conservatorium
two
at
a
time
with
wild
affrighted
eyes
and
a
halo
of
dishevelled
auburn
dove
made
no
doubt
that
he
had
been
seized
with
a
sudden
inspiration
gewandhaus
and
conservatorium
lay
close
together
in
a
new
quarter
of
the
town
the
conservatorium
a
handsome
building
three
lofty
storeys
high
was
just
now
all
the
more
imposing
in
appearance
as
it
stood
alone
in
an
unfinished
and
as
opposite
hoardings
still
shut
in
all
that
had
yet
been
raised
of
the
great
library
which
would
eventually
overshadow
it
the
severe
plainness
of
its
long
front
with
the
unbroken
lines
of
windows
did
not
fail
to
impress
the
unused
beholder
who
had
not
for
very
long
gone
daily
out
and
in
it
suggested
to
him
the
earnest
unswerving
efforts
imperative
on
his
pursuit
of
the
ideal
an
ideal
which
to
many
was
as
it
were
personified
by
the
in
the
adjoining
square
it
was
hither
towards
this
goal
that
bore
him
like
a
magic
carpet
the
young
enthusiast
most
ambitious
but
in
the
life
that
swarmed
about
the
conservatorium
there
was
nothing
of
a
tedious
austerity
it
was
one
of
the
briskest
times
of
day
and
the
short
street
and
the
steps
of
the
building
were
alive
with
young
people
of
both
sexes
young
men
sauntered
to
and
from
the
cafe
at
the
corner
or
stood
gesticulating
in
animated
groups
all
alike
were
conspicuous
for
a
rather
wilful
slovenliness
for
smooth
faces
and
bushy
hair
while
the
numerous
girls
with
whom
they
paused
to
laugh
and
trifle
were
for
the
most
part
showy
in
dress
and
loudly
vivacious
in
manner
on
the
kerbstone
a
knot
of
the
latter
tittering
among
themselves
shot
furtive
glances
at
dove
and
maurice
as
they
passed
here
a
pretty
laughing
face
was
the
centre
of
a
little
circle
there
a
bevy
of
girls
clustered
about
a
young
man
who
his
hands
in
his
pockets
leaned
carelessly
against
the
and
again
another
plump
and
much
befeathered
with
a
string
of
large
pearlbeads
round
her
fat
white
neck
had
isolated
herself
from
the
rest
to
take
up
on
the
steps
a
more
favourable
stand
a
master
who
went
by
a
small
jovial
man
in
a
big
hat
had
a
word
for
all
the
girls
even
a
chuck
of
the
chin
for
one
unusually
saucy
face
inside
classes
were
filing
out
of
the
various
rooms
other
classes
were
going
in
there
was
a
noisy
flocking
up
and
down
the
broad
central
staircase
a
crowding
about
the
a
going
and
coming
in
the
long
stone
corridors
the
was
being
lighted
maurice
slowly
made
his
way
through
the
midst
of
all
these
people
while
dove
loitered
or
stepped
out
of
hearing
with
one
friend
after
another
in
a
side
corridor
off
which
cell
like
opened
a
line
of
rooms
they
pushed
a
pair
of
doubledoors
and
went
in
to
take
their
lesson
the
room
they
entered
was
light
and
high
and
contained
besides
a
couple
of
grand
pianos
a
small
table
and
a
row
of
wooden
chairs
schwarz
stood
with
his
back
to
the
window
biting
his
nails
he
was
a
short
thickset
man
with
keen
eyes
and
a
hard
prominent
mouth
which
was
rather
emphasised
than
concealed
by
the
fair
scanty
tuft
of
hair
that
hung
from
his
chin
upon
the
two
he
bent
a
cold
deliberate
gaze
which
for
some
instants
he
allowed
to
rest
chillingly
on
them
then
as
deliberately
withdrew
having
so
at
least
it
seemed
to
those
who
were
its
object
having
without
the
tremor
of
an
eyelid
scanned
them
like
an
open
page
it
was
the
look
impenetrable
of
the
physician
for
his
patient
at
the
piano
a
young
man
was
playing
the
waldstein
sonata
so
intent
was
he
on
what
he
was
doing
that
his
head
all
but
touched
the
music
standing
open
before
him
while
his
body
bent
thus
double
swayed
vigorously
from
side
to
side
his
face
was
crimson
and
on
his
forehead
stood
out
beads
of
perspiration
he
had
no
cuffs
on
and
his
sleeves
were
a
little
turned
back
the
movement
at
an
end
he
paused
and
drawing
a
soiled
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
passed
it
rapidly
over
neck
and
brow
in
the
adagio
which
followed
he
displayed
an
extreme
delicacy
of
touch
not
however
but
what
this
also
cost
him
some
exertion
for
previous
to
the
striking
of
each
faint
soft
note
his
hand
described
a
curve
in
the
air
the
finger
he
was
about
to
use
lowered
the
others
slightly
raised
and
there
was
always
a
second
of
something
like
suspense
before
it
finally
sank
upon
the
expectant
note
but
suddenly
without
warning
just
as
the
last
lingering
tones
were
dying
to
the
close
they
sought
the
adagio
slipped
over
into
the
limpid
gaiety
of
the
rondo
and
then
there
was
no
time
more
for
premeditation
then
his
hands
twinkled
up
and
down
joining
crossing
flying
asunder
alert
with
little
sprightly
quirks
and
turns
going
ever
more
nimbly
until
the
brook
was
a
river
the
allegretto
a
prestissimo
which
flew
wildly
to
its
end
amid
a
shower
of
dazzling
trills
schwarz
stood
grave
and
apparently
impassive
from
time
to
time
however
when
unobserved
he
swept
the
three
listeners
with
a
rapid
glance
maurice
guest
was
quite
carried
away
he
had
never
heard
playing
like
this
and
he
leaned
forward
in
his
seat
and
gazed
full
at
the
player
in
open
admiration
but
his
neighbour
a
pale
thin
man
with
one
of
those
engaging
and
not
uncommon
faces
which
in
mould
of
feature
in
mildness
of
expression
and
still
more
in
the
cut
of
hair
and
beard
bear
so
marked
a
likeness
to
the
conventional
this
neighbour
looked
on
with
only
a
languid
interest
which
seemed
unable
to
get
the
upper
hand
of
melancholy
thoughts
maurice
who
believed
his
feelings
shared
by
all
about
him
was
chilled
by
such
indifference
he
only
learned
later
after
they
had
become
friends
that
nothing
roused
in
boehmer
a
real
or
lasting
interest
save
what
he
boehmer
did
himself
dove
sat
absorbed
as
reverent
as
if
at
prayer
but
there
were
also
moments
when
with
his
head
a
little
on
one
side
he
wore
an
anxious
air
as
if
not
fully
at
one
with
the
player
rendering
others
again
after
a
passage
of
peculiar
brilliancy
when
he
threw
at
schwarz
a
humbly
grateful
look
while
schwarz
the
sonata
over
was
busy
with
his
pencil
on
the
margin
of
the
music
dove
leaned
over
to
maurice
and
whispered
behind
his
hand
furst
our
best
pianist
now
came
the
turn
of
the
others
and
the
master
attention
wandered
he
stretched
himself
yawned
and
sighed
aloud
then
in
the
search
for
something
he
could
not
find
turned
out
on
the
lid
of
the
second
piano
the
contents
of
sundry
pockets
while
dove
played
he
wrote
as
if
for
life
in
a
bulky
notebook
maurice
remarked
this
without
being
properly
conscious
of
it
so
impressed
had
he
been
by
the
sonata
the
exultant
beauty
of
the
great
final
theme
had
permeated
his
every
fibre
inciting
him
emboldening
him
and
still
under
the
sway
of
this
little
elation
when
his
own
turn
to
play
came
he
was
the
richer
by
it
and
acquitted
himself
with
unusual
verve
as
the
class
was
about
to
leave
the
room
schwarz
signed
to
maurice
to
remain
behind
for
several
moments
he
paced
the
floor
in
silence
then
he
stopped
suddenly
short
in
front
of
the
young
man
and
with
legs
apart
one
hand
at
his
back
he
said
in
a
tone
which
wavered
between
being
brutal
and
confidential
emphasising
his
words
with
a
series
of
smart
on
his
hearer
shoulder
let
me
tell
you
something
if
i
were
not
of
the
opinion
that
you
had
ability
i
should
not
detain
you
this
evening
it
is
no
habit
of
mine
mark
this
to
interfere
with
my
pupils
outside
this
room
most
of
them
do
not
exist
for
me
in
your
case
i
am
making
an
exception
because
maurice
was
here
so
obviously
gratified
that
the
speaker
made
haste
to
substitute
because
i
should
much
like
to
know
how
it
is
that
you
come
to
me
in
the
state
you
do
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
for
you
know
nothing
or
let
us
say
worse
than
nothing
since
what
you
do
know
you
must
make
it
your
first
concern
to
forget
he
paused
and
the
young
man
face
fell
so
much
that
he
prolonged
the
pause
to
enjoy
the
discomfiture
he
had
produced
but
give
me
time
he
continued
adequate
time
and
i
will
undertake
to
make
something
of
you
he
lowered
his
voice
and
the
taps
became
more
confidential
there
is
good
stuff
here
you
have
talent
great
talent
and
as
i
have
observed
you
are
not
wanting
in
intelligence
but
and
again
his
voice
grew
harsher
his
eye
more
piercing
understand
me
if
you
please
no
trifling
with
other
studies
let
us
have
no
fiddling
no
composing
who
works
with
me
works
for
me
alone
and
a
lifetime
i
repeat
it
a
lifetime
is
not
long
enough
to
master
such
an
instrument
as
this
he
brought
his
hand
down
heavily
on
the
lid
of
the
piano
and
glared
at
maurice
as
if
he
expected
the
latter
to
contradict
him
then
noisily
clearing
his
throat
he
began
anew
to
pace
the
room
as
maurice
stood
waiting
for
his
dismissal
with
very
varied
feelings
of
which
however
a
faint
pride
was
uppermost
as
he
stood
waiting
the
door
opened
and
a
girl
looked
in
she
hesitated
a
moment
then
entered
and
going
up
to
schwarz
asked
him
something
in
a
low
voice
he
nodded
an
assent
nodded
two
or
three
times
and
with
quite
another
face
its
hitherto
unmoved
severity
had
given
way
to
an
indulgent
friendliness
she
laid
her
hat
and
jacket
on
the
table
and
went
to
the
piano
schwarz
motioned
maurice
to
a
chair
he
sat
down
almost
opposite
her
and
now
came
for
him
one
of
those
moments
in
life
which
undivined
send
before
them
no
promise
of
being
different
in
any
way
from
the
commonplace
moments
that
make
up
the
balance
of
our
days
no
gently
graduated
steps
lead
up
to
them
they
are
upon
us
with
the
violent
abruptness
of
a
streak
of
lightning
and
like
this
they
too
may
leave
behind
them
a
scarry
trace
what
such
a
moment
holds
within
it
is
something
which
has
never
existed
for
us
before
something
it
has
never
entered
our
minds
to
go
out
and
seek
the
corner
of
earth
happened
on
by
chance
which
comes
most
near
the
wineland
of
our
dreams
the
page
idly
perhaps
begun
which
brings
us
a
new
god
the
face
of
the
woman
who
is
to
be
our
fate
but
whatever
it
may
be
let
it
once
exist
for
us
and
the
soul
responds
forthwith
catching
in
blind
haste
at
the
dimly
missed
ideal
for
one
instant
maurice
guest
had
looked
at
the
girl
before
him
with
unconcern
but
the
next
it
was
with
an
intentness
that
soon
became
intensity
and
feverishly
grew
until
he
could
not
tear
his
eyes
away
the
beauty
whose
spell
thus
bound
him
was
of
that
subtle
kind
which
leaves
many
a
one
cold
but
as
if
just
for
this
reason
is
almost
always
fateful
for
those
who
feel
its
charm
at
them
is
lanced
its
accumulated
force
the
face
was
far
from
faultless
there
was
no
regularity
of
feature
no
perfection
of
line
nor
was
there
more
than
a
touch
of
the
sweet
girlish
freshness
that
gladdens
like
a
morning
in
may
the
features
save
for
a
peremptory
turn
of
mouth
and
chin
were
unremarkable
and
the
expression
was
distant
unchanging
but
what
was
that
to
him
this
deep
white
skin
the
purity
of
which
was
only
broken
by
the
pale
red
of
the
lips
this
dull
black
hair
which
lay
back
from
the
low
brow
in
such
wonderful
curves
and
seemed
of
itself
to
fall
into
the
loose
knot
on
the
neck
there
was
something
romantic
exotic
about
her
which
was
unlike
anything
he
had
ever
seen
she
made
him
think
of
a
rare
hothouse
flower
some
scentless
tropical
flower
with
stiff
waxen
petals
and
then
her
eyes
so
profound
was
their
darkness
that
when
they
threw
off
their
covering
of
heavy
lid
it
seemed
to
his
excited
fancy
as
if
they
must
scorch
what
they
rested
on
they
looked
out
from
the
depths
of
their
setting
like
those
of
a
wild
beast
crouched
within
a
cavern
they
lit
up
about
them
like
stars
and
when
they
fell
they
went
out
like
stars
and
her
face
took
on
the
pallor
of
early
dawn
she
was
playing
from
memory
she
gazed
straight
before
her
with
eyes
which
only
sometimes
looked
down
at
her
hands
to
aid
them
in
a
difficult
passage
at
her
belt
she
wore
a
costly
yellow
rose
and
as
she
once
leaned
towards
the
treble
where
both
hands
were
at
work
close
together
it
fell
to
the
floor
maurice
started
forward
and
picking
it
up
laid
it
on
the
piano
beneath
the
gaslight
it
sank
a
shadowy
gold
image
in
the
surface
as
yet
she
had
paid
no
heed
to
him
but
at
this
she
turned
her
head
and
still
continuing
to
play
let
her
eyes
rest
absently
on
him
they
sank
their
eyes
in
each
other
a
thrill
ran
through
maurice
a
quick
sharp
thrill
which
no
sensation
of
his
later
life
outdid
in
keenness
and
which
on
looking
back
he
could
always
feel
afresh
the
colour
rose
to
his
face
and
his
heart
beat
audibly
but
he
did
not
lower
his
eyes
and
for
not
doing
so
seemed
to
himself
infinitely
bold
a
host
of
confused
feelings
bore
down
upon
him
blotting
out
the
light
but
in
a
twinkling
all
were
swallowed
up
in
an
overpowering
sense
of
gratitude
in
a
large
vague
happy
thankfulness
which
touched
him
almost
to
the
point
of
tears
as
it
swelled
through
him
and
possessed
him
he
yearned
to
pour
it
forth
to
make
an
offering
of
this
gratefulness
fine
tangle
of
her
beauty
and
his
own
glad
mood
and
by
sustaining
her
look
he
seemed
to
lay
the
offering
at
her
feet
nor
would
any
tongue
have
persuaded
him
that
she
did
not
understand
the
few
seconds
were
eternities
when
she
turned
away
it
was
as
if
untold
hours
had
passed
over
him
in
a
body
like
a
flight
of
birds
as
if
a
sudden
gulf
had
gaped
between
where
he
now
was
and
where
he
had
previously
stood
dismissed
curtly
with
a
word
he
hung
about
the
corridor
in
the
hope
of
seeing
her
again
but
the
piano
went
on
and
on
unceasingly
here
after
some
time
he
was
found
by
dove
who
carried
him
off
with
loud
expressions
of
surprise
the
concert
was
more
than
half
over
the
main
part
of
the
hall
was
brightly
lit
and
full
of
people
from
behind
one
looked
across
a
sea
of
heads
on
the
platform
at
the
other
end
a
girl
in
red
was
playing
a
sonata
a
master
sat
by
her
side
and
leant
forward
at
regular
intervals
to
turn
the
leaves
of
the
music
dove
and
maurice
remained
standing
at
the
back
under
the
gallery
among
a
portion
of
the
audience
which
shifted
continuously
those
about
them
wandered
in
and
out
of
the
hall
at
pleasure
now
inside
head
in
hand
critically
intent
now
out
in
the
vestibule
stretching
their
legs
lounging
in
easy
chat
in
the
pause
that
followed
the
sonata
dove
went
towards
the
front
to
join
some
ladies
who
beckoned
him
and
while
some
one
sang
a
noisy
aria
maurice
gave
himself
up
to
his
own
thoughts
they
all
led
to
the
same
point
how
he
should
contrive
to
see
her
again
how
he
should
learn
her
name
and
beside
them
everything
else
seemed
remote
unreal
he
saw
the
people
next
him
as
if
from
a
distance
but
in
a
wait
that
was
longer
than
usual
he
was
awakened
to
his
surroundings
a
stir
ran
over
the
audience
like
a
gust
of
wind
over
still
water
the
heads
in
the
seats
before
him
inclined
one
to
another
wagged
and
nodded
there
was
a
gentle
buzz
of
voices
behind
him
the
doors
opened
and
shut
letting
in
all
who
were
outside
they
pressed
forward
expectantly
on
his
left
a
row
of
girls
tried
to
start
a
round
of
applause
and
tittered
nervously
at
their
failure
schilsky
had
come
down
the
platform
and
commenced
tuning
he
bent
his
long
thin
body
as
he
pressed
his
violin
to
his
knee
and
his
reddish
hair
fell
over
his
face
the
accompanist
his
hands
on
the
keys
waited
for
the
signal
to
begin
maurice
drew
a
deep
breath
of
anticipation
but
the
first
shrill
sweet
notes
had
hardly
cut
the
silence
when
the
door
opening
once
more
some
one
entered
and
pushed
through
the
standing
crowd
he
looked
round
uneasy
at
the
disturbance
and
found
that
it
was
she
what
is
more
she
came
up
to
his
very
side
he
turned
away
so
hastily
that
he
touched
her
arm
causing
it
to
yield
a
little
and
some
moments
went
by
before
he
ventured
to
look
again
when
he
did
in
some
tremor
he
saw
that
without
fear
of
discovery
he
might
look
as
long
or
as
often
as
he
chose
she
was
listening
to
the
player
with
the
raptness
of
a
painted
saint
her
whole
face
listened
the
tightened
lips
the
open
nostrils
the
wide
vigilant
eyes
maurice
lost
in
her
presence
grew
dizzy
with
the
scent
of
her
hair
that
indefinable
odour
which
has
something
of
the
raciness
in
it
of
earth
and
foolish
wishes
arose
and
jostled
one
another
in
his
mind
he
would
have
liked
to
plunge
both
hands
into
the
dark
luxuriant
mass
still
better
cautiously
to
draw
his
palm
down
this
whitest
skin
which
seen
so
near
had
a
faint
sheen
the
mere
imagining
of
it
set
him
throbbing
and
the
excitement
in
his
blood
was
heightened
by
the
sensuous
melancholy
of
the
violin
which
just
beyond
the
pale
of
his
consciousness
throbbed
and
languished
with
him
under
the
masterful
bow
shortly
before
the
end
of
the
concerto
she
turned
and
made
her
way
out
maurice
let
a
few
seconds
elapse
then
followed
but
the
long
white
corridors
stretched
empty
before
him
there
was
no
trace
of
her
to
be
seen
as
he
was
peering
about
in
places
that
were
strange
to
him
a
tumult
of
applause
shook
the
hall
the
doors
flew
open
and
the
audience
poured
out
dove
had
joined
other
friends
and
a
number
of
them
left
the
building
together
everyone
spoke
loudly
and
at
once
but
soon
maurice
and
dove
outstepped
their
companions
for
these
came
to
words
over
the
means
used
by
schilsky
to
mount
with
bravour
a
certain
gaudy
scale
of
octaves
and
at
every
second
pace
they
stopped
and
wheeled
round
with
eloquent
gesture
in
their
presence
dove
had
said
little
now
he
gave
rein
to
his
feelings
his
honest
face
glowed
with
enthusiasm
the
names
of
renowned
players
ran
off
his
lips
like
beads
off
a
string
and
in
predicting
schilsky
a
career
still
more
brilliant
his
voice
grew
husky
with
emotion
maurice
listened
unmoved
to
his
friend
outpouring
and
the
first
time
dove
stopped
for
breath
went
straight
for
the
matter
which
in
his
eyes
had
dwarfed
all
others
so
eager
was
he
to
learn
something
of
her
that
he
even
made
shift
to
describe
her
his
attempt
fell
out
lamely
and
a
second
later
he
could
have
bitten
off
his
tongue
dove
had
only
half
an
ear
for
him
eh
what
what
do
you
say
he
asked
as
maurice
paused
but
his
thoughts
were
plainly
elsewhere
this
fact
is
just
at
this
moment
he
was
intent
on
watching
some
ladies
were
they
going
to
notice
him
or
not
the
bow
made
and
returned
he
brought
his
mind
back
to
maurice
with
a
great
show
of
interest
here
however
they
all
turned
in
to
seyffert
cafe
and
seating
themselves
at
a
long
narrow
table
waited
for
schilsky
whom
they
intended
to
fete
but
minutes
passed
a
quarter
then
half
of
an
hour
and
still
he
did
not
come
to
while
the
time
his
playing
of
the
concerto
was
roundly
commented
and
discussed
there
was
none
of
the
ten
or
twelve
young
men
but
had
the
complete
jargon
of
the
craft
at
his
not
one
too
but
was
rancorous
and
admiring
in
a
breath
now
detecting
flaws
as
many
as
motes
in
a
beam
now
heaping
praise
the
spirited
talk
flying
thus
through
the
gamut
of
opinion
went
forward
chiefly
in
german
which
the
foreigners
of
the
party
spoke
with
various
accents
but
glibly
enough
only
now
and
then
did
one
of
them
spring
over
to
his
to
fetch
a
racy
idiom
or
point
a
joke
not
having
heard
a
note
of
schilsky
playing
maurice
did
not
trust
himself
to
say
much
and
so
was
free
to
observe
his
neighbour
a
young
man
who
had
entered
late
and
taken
a
vacant
chair
beside
him
to
the
others
present
the
paid
no
heed
to
maurice
he
murmured
an
absent
greeting
and
then
having
called
for
beer
and
emptied
his
glass
at
a
draught
he
appeared
mentally
to
return
whence
he
had
come
or
to
engage
without
delay
in
some
urgent
train
of
thought
his
movements
were
noiseless
but
startlingly
abrupt
thus
after
sitting
quiet
for
a
time
his
head
in
his
hands
he
flung
back
in
his
seat
with
a
sort
of
wildness
and
began
to
stare
fixedly
at
the
ceiling
his
face
was
one
of
those
which
as
by
a
mystery
preserve
the
innocent
beauty
of
their
childhood
long
after
childhood
is
a
thing
of
the
past
delicate
as
the
rosy
lining
of
a
great
was
the
colour
that
spread
from
below
the
forked
blue
veins
of
the
temples
and
it
paled
and
came
again
as
readily
as
a
girl
girlish
too
were
the
limpid
eyes
which
but
for
a
trick
of
dropping
unexpectedly
seemed
always
to
be
gazing
in
thoughtful
surprise
at
something
that
was
visible
to
them
alone
as
to
the
small
frail
body
it
existed
only
for
sake
of
the
hands
narrow
hands
with
long
fleshless
fingers
nervous
hands
that
were
never
still
all
at
once
in
a
momentary
lull
he
leant
towards
maurice
and
without
even
looking
up
asked
the
latter
if
he
could
recall
the
opening
bars
of
the
prelude
to
tristan
und
isolde
if
so
there
was
a
certain
point
he
would
like
to
lay
before
him
you
see
it
this
way
old
fellow
he
said
confidentially
come
to
the
conclusion
that
if
at
the
end
of
the
third
bar
wagner
had
throw
him
out
throw
him
out
cried
an
american
who
was
sitting
opposite
them
you
might
as
well
try
to
stop
a
nigger
in
heat
as
krafft
on
wagner
that
so
said
another
american
named
ford
who
on
arriving
had
not
been
quite
sober
and
now
after
a
few
glasses
of
beer
was
exceedingly
tipsy
that
so
as
i
always
said
it
a
disgrace
to
the
township
a
disgrace
sir
ought
to
be
put
down
why
do
he
write
them
himself
from
the
depths
of
his
brown
study
krafft
looked
vaguely
at
the
speakers
and
checked
but
not
discomposed
drew
out
a
notebook
and
jotted
down
an
idea
meanwhile
at
the
far
end
of
the
table
boehmer
and
a
russian
violinist
still
harped
upon
the
original
string
and
having
worked
out
schilsky
they
passed
on
to
zeppelin
his
master
and
the
russian
who
was
not
zeppelin
pupil
set
to
showing
with
vehemence
that
his
method
was
a
worthless
one
he
was
barely
started
when
a
wiry
american
in
a
high
grating
voice
called
schilsky
a
wretched
fool
why
had
he
not
gone
to
berlin
at
easter
as
he
had
planned
instead
of
dawdling
on
here
where
he
had
no
more
to
gain
at
this
several
of
the
young
men
laughed
and
looked
significant
furst
he
had
proved
to
be
a
jolly
little
man
who
with
unbuttoned
vest
absorbed
large
quantities
of
beer
and
perspired
freely
furst
alone
was
of
the
opinion
which
he
expressed
forcibly
in
his
hearty
saxon
dialect
that
had
schilsky
left
leipzig
at
this
particular
time
he
would
have
been
a
fool
indeed
look
here
boys
he
cried
pounding
the
table
to
get
attention
that
all
very
well
but
he
must
have
an
eye
to
the
practical
side
of
things
too
der
biedere

hoch
threw
in
boehmer
who
was
prussian
and
of
a
more
ideal
cast
of
and
a
chance
such
as
this
he
will
certainly
never
have
again
a
hundred
thousand
marks
if
a
pfennig
and
a
face
to
turn
after
in
the
street
no
he
is
a
confounded
deal
wiser
to
stay
here
and
make
sure
of
her
for
that
sort
is
as
slippery
as
an
eel
krafft
can
tell
us
he
let
her
go

she
is
it
true
shouted
half
a
dozen
krafft
looked
up
and
winked
his
reply
was
so
gross
and
so
witty
that
there
was
a
very
howl
of
mirth
krafft
hoch
hoch
krafft
they
cried
and
roared
again
until
the
proprietor
a
mild
man
who
was
loath
to
meddle
with
his
best
customers
advanced
to
the
middle
of
the
floor
where
he
stood
smiling
uneasily
and
rubbing
his
hands
but
it
was
growing
late
why
the
devil
does

perhaps
said
dove
mouthing
deliberately
as
if
he
had
a
good
thing
on
his
tongue
perhaps
by
now
he
is
safe
in
the
arms
of
jesus
or
morpheus
asked
a
cockney
safe
in
the
arms
of
jesus
sang
the
tipsy
pianist
but
he
was
outsung
by
krafft
who
rising
from
his
seat
gave
with
dramatic
gesture
o
sink
hernieder
nacht
der
liebe
gieb
vergessen
dass
ich
lebe
after
this
with
much
laughter
and
ado
they
broke
up
to
seek
another
cafe
in
the
heart
of
the
town
where
the
absinthe
was
good
and
the
better
two
of
his
friends
supporting
ford
who
was
testily
debating
with
himself
why
a
composer
should
compose
his
own
works
at
the
first
corner
maurice
whispered
a
word
to
dove
and
unnoticed
by
the
rest
slipped
away
for
some
time
he
heard
the
sound
of
their
voices
down
the
quiet
street
a
member
of
the
group
in
defiance
of
the
night
began
to
sing
and
then
just
as
one
bird
is
provoked
by
another
rose
a
clear
sweet
voice
he
recognised
as
krafft
in
a
song
the
refrain
of
which
was
sung
by
all
give
me
the
rose
of
sharon
and
a
bottle
of
cyprus
wine
what
followed
was
confused
indistinct
but
over
and
over
again
he
heard
the
rose
of
sharon
a
bottle
of
cyprus
wine
until
that
too
was
lost
in
the
distance
when
he
reached
his
room
he
did
not
light
the
lamp
but
crossed
to
the
window
and
stood
looking
out
into
the
darkness
the
day
impressions
motley
as
the
changes
of
a
kaleidoscope
seethed
in
his
brain
clamoured
to
be
recalled
and
set
in
order
but
he
kept
them
back
he
could
not
face
the
task
he
felt
averse
to
any
mental
effort
in
need
of
a
repose
as
absolute
as
the
very
essence
of
silence
itself
the
sky
was
overcast
a
wayward
breeze
blew
coolly
in
upon
him
and
refreshed
him
a
few
single
raindrops
fell
in
the
air
a
gentle
melancholy
was
abroad
and
as
he
stood
there
wax
for
any
passing
mood
it
descended
on
him
and
enveloped
him
he
gave
himself
up
to
it
unresistingly
allowed
himself
to
toy
with
it
to
sink
beneath
it
just
however
as
he
was
sinking
sinking
he
was
roused
suddenly
as
from
sleep
by
the
vivid
presentiment
that
something
was
about
to
happen
to
him
it
seemed
as
if
an
important
event
were
looming
in
the
near
distance
ready
to
burst
in
upon
his
life
and
not
only
instantly
but
with
a
monstrous
crash
of
sound
his
pulses
beat
more
quickly
his
nerves
stretched
like
bows
but
it
was
very
still
everything
around
him
slept
and
the
streets
were
deserted
a
keen
sense
of
desolation
came
over
him
never
in
his
life
had
he
felt
so
utterly
alone
in
all
this
great
city
that
spread
around
him
not
a
heart
was
the
lighter
for
his
being
there
oh
to
have
some
one
beside
him
some
one
who
would
talk
soothingly
to
him
of
shadowy
things
or
still
better
be
merely
a
sympathetic
presence
he
passed
rapidly
in
review
people
he
had
known
saw
their
faces
and
heard
their
voices
but
not
one
of
them
would
do
no
he
wanted
a
friend
the
friend
he
had
often
dreamed
of
whose
thoughts
would
be
his
thoughts
with
whom
there
would
be
no
need
of
speech
then
his
longing
swelled
grew
fiercer
and
more
undefined
and
a
sudden
burst
of
energy
convulsed
him
and
struggled
to
find
vent
his
breath
came
hard
and
he
stretched
his
arms
out
into
the
night
uncertainly
as
if
to
grasp
something
he
did
not
see
but
they
fell
to
his
side
again
he
would
have
liked
to
sweep
through
the
air
to
feel
the
wind
rushing
dizzily
through
him
or
to
be
set
down
before
some
feat
that
demanded
the
strength
of
a
titan
anything
no
matter
what
to
be
rid
of
the
fever
in
his
veins
but
it
beset
him
again
and
again
only
by
slow
degrees
weakening
and
dying
away
a
bitter
moisture
sprang
to
his
eyes
leaning
his
head
on
his
arms
he
endeavoured
to
call
up
her
face
but
it
was
of
no
use
though
he
strained
every
nerve
for
some
time
he
could
see
only
the
rose
that
had
lain
beside
her
on
the
piano
and
in
the
troubled
image
that
at
last
crowned
his
patience
her
eyes
looked
out
like
jewels
from
a
setting
of
golden
petals
lying
wakeful
in
the
darkness
he
saw
them
more
clearly
now
though
they
had
a
bluish
light
were
like
moons
moons
that
burnt
if
he
lit
the
lamp
and
tried
to
read
they
got
between
him
and
the
book
and
danced
up
and
down
the
pages
with
jerky
clockwork
movements
like
stage
fireflies
he
put
the
light
out
and
lay
staring
vacantly
at
the
pale
square
of
the
window
and
then
just
when
he
was
least
expecting
it
he
saw
the
whole
face
so
close
to
him
and
so
distinctly
that
he
started
up
on
his
elbow
and
in
the
second
or
two
it
remained
a
opaquely
white
with
deep
unfathomable
eyes
he
recognised
with
a
shock
that
his
peace
of
mind
was
gone
that
the
sudden
experience
of
a
few
hours
back
had
given
his
life
new
meaning
that
something
had
happened
to
him
which
could
not
be
undone
in
other
words
with
an
incredulous
gasp
at
his
own
folly
that
he
was
head
over
ears
in
love
through
the
uneasy
sleep
into
which
he
ultimately
fell
she
and
the
yellow
rose
and
the
rose
of
sharon
a
giant
flower
with
monstrous
crimson
petals
passed
and
repassed
in
one
of
those
glorious
tangles
which
no
dreamer
has
ever
unravelled
when
he
wakened
it
was
broad
daylight
and
things
wore
a
different
aspect
not
that
his
impression
of
the
night
had
faded
but
it
was
forced
to
retire
behind
the
hard
clear
affairs
of
the
morning
he
got
up
full
of
vigour
impatient
to
be
at
work
and
having
breakfasted
sat
down
at
the
piano
where
he
remained
until
his
hands
dropped
from
the
keys
with
fatigue
throughout
these
hours
his
mind
ran
chiefly
on
the
words
schwarz
had
said
to
him
the
previous
evening
they
rose
before
him
in
their
full
significance
and
he
leisurely
chewed
the
honeyed
cud
of
praise
i
will
undertake
to
make
something
of
you
undertake
to
make
something
of
you
his
brain
tore
the
phrase
to
tatters
something
was
properly
vague
as
praise
should
be
and
allowed
the
imagination
free
scope
under
the
stimulus
everything
came
easy
he
mastered
a
passage
of
bound
sixths
that
had
baffled
him
for
days
and
in
this
elated
frame
of
mind
there
was
something
almost
pleasurable
in
the
pang
with
which
he
would
become
conscious
of
a
shadow
in
the
background
a
spot
on
his
sun
to
make
him
unhappy
unhappy
no
it
gave
a
zest
to
his
goings
out
and
through
long
hours
of
work
he
was
borne
up
by
an
ardent
hope
afterwards
he
might
see
her
it
made
the
streets
exciting
places
of
possible
surprises
might
she
not
at
any
moment
turn
the
corner
and
be
before
him
might
she
not
this
very
instant
be
going
in
the
same
direction
as
he
in
the
next
street
but
a
very
little
of
this
pleasant
dallying
with
chance
was
enough
one
morning
when
the
houses
opposite
were
ablaze
with
sunshine
and
he
had
settled
down
to
practice
with
a
keen
relish
for
the
obstacles
to
be
overcome
on
this
morning
within
half
an
hour
his
mood
swung
round
to
the
other
extreme
and
from
now
on
his
desire
to
see
her
again
was
a
burning
unrest
which
roused
him
from
sleep
and
drove
him
out
at
odd
hours
no
matter
what
he
was
doing
moodily
he
scoured
the
streets
round
the
conservatorium
disconcerted
by
his
own
folly
and
pricked
incessantly
by
the
consciousness
of
time
wasted
a
companion
at
his
side
might
have
dispelled
the
cobwebs
but
dove
his
only
friend
he
avoided
for
the
reason
that
dove
unfailing
good
spirits
needed
to
be
met
with
a
similar
mood
and
as
for
speaking
of
the
matter
the
mere
thought
of
the
detailed
explanation
that
would
now
be
necessary
did
he
open
his
lips
filled
him
with
dismay
when
four
or
five
days
had
gone
by
in
this
manner
without
result
he
took
to
hanging
about
with
other
idlers
on
the
steps
of
the
conservatorium
always
hoping
that
she
would
suddenly
emerge
from
the
doors
behind
him
or
come
towards
him
a
roll
of
music
in
her
hand
but
she
never
came
one
afternoon
however
as
he
loitered
there
he
encountered
his
acquaintance
of
the
very
first
day
he
recognised
her
while
she
was
still
some
distance
off
by
her
peculiar
springy
gait
at
each
step
she
rose
slightly
on
the
front
part
of
her
foot
as
if
her
heels
were
on
springs
as
before
she
was
indifferently
dressed
a
small
close
hat
came
down
over
her
face
and
hid
her
forehead
her
skirt
seemed
shrunken
and
hung
limp
about
her
ankles
accentuating
the
straightness
of
her
figure
but
below
the
brim
of
the
hat
her
eyes
were
as
bright
as
ever
and
took
note
of
all
that
happened
on
seeing
maurice
she
professed
to
remember
him
perfectly
beginning
to
speak
before
she
had
quite
come
up
to
him
the
following
day
they
met
once
more
at
the
same
place
this
time
she
raised
her
eyebrows
you
here
again
she
said
she
disappeared
inside
the
building
but
a
few
minutes
later
returned
and
said
she
was
going
for
a
walk
would
he
come
too
he
assented
with
grateful
surprise
and
they
set
off
together
in
the
direction
of
the
woods
as
briskly
as
though
they
were
on
an
errand
but
when
they
had
crossed
the
and
reached
the
quieter
paths
that
ran
through
the
nonne
they
simultaneously
slackened
their
pace
the
luxuriant
undergrowth
of
shrub
which
filled
in
like
lacework
the
spaces
between
the
was
sprinkled
with
its
first
dots
and
pricks
of
green
and
the
afternoon
was
pleasant
for
walking
sunless
and
still
and
just
a
little
fragrantly
damp
from
all
the
rife
budding
and
sprouting
it
was
a
day
to
further
a
friendship
more
effectually
than
half
a
dozen
brighter
ones
a
day
on
which
to
speak
out
thoughts
which
a
june
sky
the
indiscreet
playing
of
full
sunlight
even
the
rustling
of
the
breeze
in
the
leaves
might
scare
like
fish
from
the
surface
when
they
had
laughingly
introduced
themselves
to
each
other
maurice
guest
companion
talked
about
herself
with
a
frankness
that
left
nothing
to
be
desired
and
impressed
the
young
man
at
her
side
very
agreeably
before
they
had
gone
far
he
knew
all
about
her
her
name
was
madeleine
wade
she
came
from
a
small
town
in
leicestershire
and
except
for
a
stood
alone
in
the
world
for
several
years
she
had
been
a
teacher
in
a
large
school
near
london
and
the
position
was
open
for
her
to
return
to
when
she
had
completed
this
the
final
year
of
her
course
then
however
she
would
devote
herself
exclusively
to
the
teaching
of
music
and
with
this
in
view
she
had
here
taken
up
as
many
branches
of
study
as
she
had
time
for
besides
piano
which
was
her
chief
subject
she
learned
singing
organ
counterpoint
and
the
elements
of
the
violin
so
much
is
demanded
nowadays
she
said
in
her
dear
soprano
and
if
you
want
to
get
on
it
does
do
to
be
behindhand
of
course
it
means
hard
work
but
that
is
nothing
to
me
i
am
used
to
work
and
love
it
since
i
was
seventeen
i
am
now
i
can
fairly
say
i
have
never
got
up
in
the
morning
without
having
my
whole
day
mapped
and
planned
before
so
you
see
idlers
can
have
no
place
on
my
list
of
saints
she
spoke
lightly
yet
with
a
certain
as
however
maurice
guest
on
whom
her
words
made
a
sympathetic
impression
as
of
something
strong
and
as
he
did
not
respond
to
it
she
fell
back
on
directness
and
asked
him
what
he
had
been
doing
when
she
met
him
both
on
this
day
and
the
one
before
i
tell
you
candidly
i
was
astonished
to
find
you
there
again
she
said
as
a
rule
are
desperately
earnest
brooms
his
laugh
was
a
trifle
uneasy
and
he
answered
evasively
not
meaning
to
say
much
but
he
had
reckoned
without
the
week
of
silence
that
lay
behind
him
it
had
been
more
of
a
strain
than
he
knew
and
his
speech
once
set
agoing
could
not
be
brought
to
a
stop
an
almost
physical
need
of
communication
made
itself
felt
in
him
he
spoke
with
a
volubility
that
was
foreign
to
him
began
his
sentences
with
a
confidential
you
see
and
said
things
at
which
he
himself
was
amazed
he
related
impressions
not
facts
and
impressions
which
until
now
he
had
not
been
conscious
of
receiving
he
told
unguardedly
of
his
plans
and
ambitions
and
even
went
back
and
touched
on
his
dwelling
with
considerable
bitterness
on
the
scant
sympathy
he
had
received
his
companion
looked
at
him
curiously
she
had
expected
a
casual
answer
to
her
casual
words
a
surface
frankness
such
as
she
herself
had
shown
and
at
first
she
felt
sceptical
towards
this
unbidden
confidence
she
did
not
care
for
people
who
gave
themselves
away
at
a
word
either
they
were
naive
to
foolishness
or
inordinately
vain
but
having
listened
for
some
time
to
his
outpourings
she
began
to
feel
reassured
and
soon
she
understood
that
he
was
talking
thus
at
random
merely
because
he
was
lonely
and
before
he
had
finished
she
was
even
a
little
gratified
by
his
openness
and
on
his
confiding
to
her
what
schwarz
had
said
to
him
she
smiled
indulgently
perhaps
i
took
it
to
mean
more
than
it
actually
did
said
maurice
apologetically
but
anyhow
it
was
cheering
to
hear
it
you
see
i
must
prove
to
the
people
at
home
that
i
was
right
and
they
were
wrong
failure
was
preached
at
me
on
every
side
i
was
the
only
soul
to
believe
in
myself
and
you
really
disliked
teaching
so
hated
it
with
all
my
heart
she
frankly
examined
him
he
had
a
pale
longish
face
with
thin
lips
which
might
indicate
either
narrow
prejudice
or
a
fanatic
tenacity
when
he
grew
animated
he
had
a
habit
of
opening
his
eyes
very
wide
and
of
staring
straight
before
him
at
such
moments
too
he
tossed
back
his
head
with
the
impatient
movements
of
a
young
horse
his
hands
and
feet
were
good
his
clothes
of
a
provincial
cut
her
fingers
itched
to
retie
the
bow
of
his
cravat
for
him
to
pull
him
here
and
there
into
shape
altogether
he
made
the
impression
upon
her
of
being
a
very
young
man
when
he
coloured
or
otherwise
grew
embarrassed
under
her
steady
gaze
she
mentally
put
him
down
for
less
than
twenty
but
he
had
good
manners
he
allowed
her
to
pass
before
him
where
the
way
grew
narrow
walked
on
the
outside
of
the
path
made
haste
to
draw
back
an
obstreperous
branch
and
not
one
of
these
trifling
conventionalities
was
lost
on
madeleine
wade
they
had
turned
their
steps
homewards
and
were
drawing
near
the
edge
of
the
wood
when
through
the
which
here
were
bare
and
far
apart
they
saw
two
people
walking
arm
in
arm
and
on
turning
a
corner
found
the
couple
coming
straight
towards
them
on
the
same
path
as
themselves
in
the
full
flush
of
his
talk
maurice
guest
did
not
at
first
grasp
what
was
about
to
happen
he
had
ended
the
sentence
he
was
at
and
begun
another
before
the
truth
broke
on
him
then
he
stuttered
lost
the
thread
of
his
thought
was
abruptly
silent
and
what
he
had
been
going
to
say
and
what
a
moment
before
had
seemed
of
the
utmost
importance
was
never
said
his
companion
did
not
seem
to
notice
his
preoccupation
she
gave
an
exclamation
of
what
sounded
like
surprise
and
herself
looked
steadily
at
the
approaching
pair
thus
they
went
forward
to
a
meeting
which
the
young
man
had
imagined
to
himself
in
many
ways
but
not
in
this
the
moment
he
had
waited
for
had
come
and
now
he
wished
himself
miles
away
meanwhile
they
walked
on
in
a
brutal
fashion
and
at
a
fairish
pace
though
each
step
he
took
was
an
event
and
his
feet
were
as
heavy
and
awkward
as
if
they
did
not
belong
to
him
the
other
two
sauntered
towards
them
without
haste
the
man
she
was
with
had
his
arm
through
hers
her
hand
in
his
left
hand
while
in
his
right
he
twirled
a
cane
they
were
not
speaking
she
looked
before
her
rather
listlessly
with
dark
indifferent
eyes
to
see
this
to
see
also
that
she
was
taller
and
broader
than
he
had
believed
and
in
full
daylight
somewhat
sallow
maurice
had
first
to
conquer
an
aversion
to
look
at
all
on
account
of
the
open
familiarity
of
their
attitude
it
was
not
like
this
that
he
had
dreamt
of
finding
her
and
so
it
happened
that
when
without
a
word
to
him
his
companion
crossed
the
path
and
confronted
the
other
two
he
only
lingered
for
an
instant
in
an
agony
of
indecision
and
then
by
an
impulse
over
which
he
had
no
control
walked
on
and
stood
out
of
earshot
he
drew
a
deep
breath
like
one
who
has
escaped
a
danger
but
almost
simultaneously
he
bit
his
lip
with
mortification
could
any
power
on
earth
make
it
clear
to
him
why
he
had
acted
in
this
way
all
his
thoughts
had
been
directed
towards
this
moment
for
so
long
only
to
take
this
miserable
end
a
string
of
contemptuous
epithets
for
himself
rose
to
his
lips
but
when
he
looked
back
at
the
group
the
reason
of
his
folly
was
apparent
to
him
at
the
sight
of
this
other
beside
her
a
sharp
twinge
of
jealousy
had
run
through
him
and
disturbed
his
balance
he
gazed
ardently
at
her
in
the
hope
that
she
would
look
round
but
it
was
only
the
man
he
was
caressing
his
slight
moustache
and
hitting
at
loose
stones
while
the
girls
talked
who
turned
as
if
drawn
by
maurice
stare
and
looked
full
at
him
with
studied
insolence
in
him
maurice
recognised
the
violinist
of
the
concert
but
he
too
was
taller
than
he
had
believed
and
much
younger
a
mere
boy
said
maurice
to
himself
a
mere
boy
with
a
disagreeable
dissipated
face
madeleine
wade
came
hurrying
to
rejoin
him
apologising
for
the
delay
the
meeting
had
however
been
fortunate
as
she
had
had
a
message
from
schwarz
to
deliver
maurice
let
a
few
seconds
elapse
then
asked
without
preamble
who
is
that
his
companion
looked
quickly
at
him
struck
both
by
his
tone
and
by
his
unconscious
use
of
the
singular
the
air
of
indifference
with
which
he
was
looking
out
across
the
meadowland
told
its
own
tale
schilsky
do
you
know
schilsky
our
joachim
in
spe
she
asked
to
tease
him
maurice
guest
coloured
yes
i
heard
him
play
the
other
night
he
answered
in
good
faith
but
i
did
mean
him
i
meant
the
the
lady
he
was
with
the
girl
at
his
side
laughed
not
very
heartily
et
tu
brute
she
said
i
might
have
known
it
it
really
is
remarkable
that
though
so
many
people
do
think
louise
goodlooking
i
have
often
heard
her
called
plain
yet
i
never
knew
a
man
go
past
her
without
turning
his
you
want
to
know
who
and
what
she
is
well
that
depends
on
whom
you
ask
schwarz
would
tell
you
she
was
one
of
his
most
gifted
pupils
but
no
he
always
says
that
of
his
pretty
girls
and
some
do
find
her
pretty
you
know
she
is
indeed
very
said
maurice
with
warmth
though
i
think
pretty
is
not
just
the
word
no
i
do
suppose
it
is
said
madeleine
and
this
time
there
was
a
note
of
mockery
in
her
laugh
but
maurice
did
not
let
himself
be
deterred
as
it
seemed
likely
that
she
was
going
to
let
the
subject
rest
here
he
persisted
but
suppose
i
asked
you
what
would
you
say
she
gave
him
a
shrewd
i
think
i
wo
tell
you
she
said
more
gravely
if
a
man
has
once
thought
a
girl
pretty
and
all
the
rest
of
it
he
never
grateful
for
the
truth
if
i
said
louise
was
a
baggage
or
a
minx
or
some
other
horrid
thing
you
would
always
bear
me
a
grudge
for
it
so
please
note
i
do
say
it
for
we
are
going
to
be
friends
i
hope
i
hope
so
too
said
the
young
man
they
walked
some
distance
along
the
unfinished
end
of
the
mozartstrasse
where
only
a
few
villas
stood
in
newly
made
gardens
at
least
i
should
like
to
know
her
name
her
whole
name
you
said
louise
i
think
she
laughed
outright
at
this
her
name
is
dufrayer
louise
dufrayer
and
she
has
been
here
studying
with
schwarz
for
about
a
year
and
a
half
now
she
has
some
talent
but
is
indolent
to
the
last
degree
and
only
works
when
she
ca
help
it
also
she
always
has
an
admirer
of
some
kind
in
tow
this
is
her
last
particular
is
that
biographical
matter
enough
he
was
afraid
he
had
made
himself
ridiculous
in
her
eyes
and
did
not
answer
they
walked
the
rest
of
the
way
in
silence
at
her
they
paused
to
take
leave
of
each
other
come
and
see
me
sometimes
when
you
have
time
we
were
once
colleagues
you
know
and
are
now
i
should
be
glad
to
help
you
if
you
ever
need
help
he
thanked
her
and
promised
to
remember
then
walked
home
without
knowing
how
he
did
it
he
had
room
in
brain
for
one
thought
only
he
knew
her
name
he
knew
her
name
he
said
it
again
and
again
to
himself
walked
in
time
with
it
and
found
it
as
heady
as
wine
the
mere
sound
of
the
spoken
syllables
seemed
to
bring
her
nearer
to
him
to
establish
a
mysterious
connection
between
them
moreover
in
itself
it
pleased
him
extraordinarily
and
he
was
vaguely
grateful
to
something
outside
himself
that
it
was
a
name
he
could
honestly
admire
in
a
kind
of
defiant
challenge
to
unseen
powers
he
doubled
his
arm
and
felt
the
muscles
in
it
then
he
sat
down
at
his
piano
and
to
the
dismay
of
his
landlady
for
it
was
now
late
evening
practised
for
a
couple
of
hours
without
stopping
and
the
scales
he
sent
flying
up
and
down
in
the
darkness
had
a
ring
of
exultation
in
them
were
like
cries
of
triumph
he
had
discovered
the
open
sesame
to
his
treasure
and
there
was
time
and
to
spare
he
left
everything
to
the
future
in
blind
trust
that
it
would
bring
him
good
fortune
it
was
enough
that
they
were
here
together
inhabitants
of
the
same
town
besides
he
had
formed
a
friendship
with
some
one
who
knew
her
a
way
would
surely
open
up
in
which
he
might
make
her
aware
of
his
presence
in
the
meantime
it
was
something
to
live
for
each
day
that
dawned
might
be
the
day
but
little
by
little
like
a
fountain
run
dry
his
elation
subsided
and
as
he
lay
sleepless
he
had
a
sudden
fit
of
jealous
despair
he
remembered
with
a
horrid
distinctness
how
he
had
seen
her
again
she
came
towards
them
at
the
other
side
hand
in
hand
with
him
inattentive
to
all
but
him
now
he
could
almost
have
wept
at
the
recollection
those
clasped
hands
he
could
have
forgiven
everything
else
but
the
thought
of
these
remained
with
him
and
stung
him
here
he
lay
thinking
wild
and
foolish
things
building
castles
that
had
no
earthly
foundation
and
all
the
time
it
was
another
who
had
the
right
to
be
with
her
to
walk
at
her
side
and
share
her
thoughts
again
he
was
the
outsider
behind
these
two
was
a
life
full
of
detail
and
circumstance
of
which
he
knew
nothing
his
excited
brain
called
up
pictures
imagined
fiercely
at
words
and
looks
until
the
darkness
and
stillness
of
the
room
became
unendurable
and
he
sprang
up
threw
on
his
clothing
and
went
out
retracing
his
steps
he
found
the
very
spot
where
they
had
met
guiltily
with
a
stealthy
look
round
him
though
wood
and
night
were
black
as
ink
he
knelt
down
and
kissed
the
gravel
where
he
thought
she
had
stood
iv
it
was
through
dove
agency
dove
was
always
on
the
spot
to
guide
and
assist
his
friends

advise
where
the
best
or
cheapest
or
rarest
of
anything
was
to
be
had
from
secondhand

knew
those
shops
where
the
of
ham
or
weighed
heavier
than
elsewhere
restaurants
where
the
beer
had
least
froth
and
the
cutlets
were
largest
for
the
money
knew
the
ins
and
outs
of
leipzig
as
no
other
foreigner
did
knew
all
that
went
on
and
the
affairs
of
everybody
as
though
he
went
through
life
garnering
in
just
those
little
facts
that
others
were
apt
to
overlook
through
dove
maurice
became
a
paying
guest
at
a
kept
by
two
maiden
ladies
who
eked
out
their
income
by
providing
a
plain
meal
at
a
low
price
for
respectable
young
people
the
company
was
made
up
to
a
large
extent
of
foreigners
there
were
several
university
students
older
men
with
beards
and
spectacles
who
looked
down
on
the
young
musicians
and
talked
of
set
purpose
on
abstruse
subjects
more
noteworthy
were
two
american
pianists
ford
who
could
not
carry
a
single
glass
of
beer
and
played
better
when
he
had
had
more

one

an
unfaltering
opinion

himself
and

ruin
any

two
ladies
were
also
present
philadelphia
jensen
of
parentage
was
a
student
of
under
a
swedish
singing
master
who
had
lately
set
musical
circles
in
a
ferment
with
his
new
and
extraordinary
method
its
devotees
swore
that
in
time
it
would
display
marvellous
results
but
in
the
meantime
the
most
advanced
pupils
were
only
emitting
single
notes
and
the
greater
number
stood
every
morning
before
their
respective
mirrors
watching
their
mouths
open
and
shut
without
producing
a
sound
miss
jensen
she
preferred
the
english
pronunciation
of
the

was
a
large
fleshy
woman
with
a
curled
fringe
and
prominent
eyes
her
future
was
the
object
of
general
admiration
it
was
whispered
that
she
aimed
at
isolde
loud
in
voice
and
manner
she
was
fond
of
proclaiming
her
views
on
all
kinds
of
subjects
from
diaphragmatic
respiration
through
ghosts
which
was
being
read
by
a
bold
advanced
few
down
to
the
continental
methods
of
regulating
vice
to
the
intense
embarrassment
of
those
who
sat
next
her
at
table
still
another
american
lady
miss
martin
was
studying
with
bendel
the
rival
of
schwarz
and
as
she
lived
in
the
same
quarter
of
the
town
as
dove
and
maurice
the
three
of
them
often
walked
home
together
for
the
most
part
miss
martin
was
in
a
state
of
tragic
despair
with
the
frankness
of
her
race
she
admitted
that
she
had
arrived
in
leipzig
expecting
to
astonish
in
this
she
had
been
disappointed
bendel
had
treated
her
like
any
other
of
his
pupils
she
was
still
playing
haydn
and
czerny
and
saw
endless
vistas
of
similar
composers
back
of
these
dove
laid
the
whole
blame
on
bendel
method
which
he
denounced
with
eloquence
and
strongly
advocated
her
becoming
a
pupil
of
schwarz
he
himself
undertook
to
arrange
matters
and
in
what
seemed
an
incredibly
short
time
the
change
was
effected
for
a
little
things
went
better
schwarz
was
reported
to
have
said
that
she
had
talent
great
talent
and
that
he
would
make
something
of
her
but
soon
she
was
complaining
anew
if
there
were
any
difference
between
czerny
and
bertini
haydn
and
dussek
some
one
might
slick
up
and
tell
her
what
it
was
off
the
subject
of
her
own
gifts
she
was
a
lively
affable
girl
with
eyes
pale
flaxen
hair
and
eyebrows
and
both
young
men
got
on
well
with
her
in
the
usual
superficial
way
for
maurice
guest
she
had
the
additional
attraction
that
he
had
once
seen
her
in
the
street
with
the
object
of
his
romantic
fancy
since
the
afternoon
when
he
had
heard
from
madeleine
wade
who
this
was
he
had
not
advanced
a
step
nearer
making
her
acquaintance
though
a
couple
of
weeks
had
passed
though
he
now
knew
two
people
who
knew
her
and
though
his
satisfaction
at
learning
her
name
had
immediately
yielded
to
a
hunger
for
more
and
now
hardly
a
day
went
by
on
which
he
did
not
see
her
his
infatuation
had
made
him
keen
of
scent
by
following
her
with
due
precaution
he
had
found
out
for
himself
in
the
bruderstrasse
the
roomy
old
house
she
lived
in
had
found
out
how
she
came
and
went
he
knew
her
associates
knew
the
streets
she
preferred
the
hour
of
day
at
which
she
was
to
be
met
at
the
conservatorium
far
away
at
the
other
end
of
one
of
the
quiet
streets
that
lay
wide
and
sunny
about
the
gewandhaus
when
to
other
eyes
she
was
a
mere
speck
in
the
distance
he
learned
to
recognise
her
if
only
by
the
speed
at
which
his
heart
beat
and
he
even
gave
chase
to
imaginary
resemblances
once
he
remained
sitting
in
a
tramway
far
beyond
his
destination
because
he
traced
in
one
of
the
passengers
a
curious
likeness
to
her
in
long
wavy
eyebrows
that
were
highest
in
the
middle
of
the
forehead
thus
the
pale
face
with
the
heavy
eyes
haunted
him
by
day
and
by
night
he
was
very
happy
and
very
unhappy
by
turns
never
at
rest
if
he
imagined
she
had
looked
observantly
at
him
as
she
passed
he
was
elated
for
hours
after
if
she
did
not
seem
to
notice
him
it
was
brought
home
to
him
anew
that
he
was
nothing
to
her
and
once
when
he
had
gazed
too
boldly
instead
of
turning
away
his
eyes
as
she
went
close
by
him
to
schwarz
room
and
she
had
resented
the
look
with
cold
surprise
he
felt
as
culpable
as
if
he
had
insulted
her
he
atoned
for
his
behaviour
the
next
time
they
met
by
assuming
his
very
humblest
air
once
too
he
deliberately
threw
himself
in
her
way
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
standing
aside
with
the
emphatic
deference
of
a
slave
throughout
this
period
and
particularly
after
an
occasion
such
as
the
last
his
was
so
peculiarly
intensified
that
his
surroundings
ceased
to
exist
for
him
they
two
were
the
gigantic
figures
on
a
shadow
background
and
what
he
sometimes
could
not
believe
was
that
such
feelings
as
these
should
be
seething
in
him
and
she
remain
ignorant
of
them
he
lost
touch
with
reality
and
dreamed
dreams
of
imperceptible
threads
finer
than
any
gossamer
which
could
be
spun
from
soul
to
soul
without
the
need
of
speech
he
heaped
on
her
all
the
spiritual
perfections
that
answered
to
her
appearance
and
he
did
not
for
a
time
observe
anything
to
make
him
waver
in
his
faith
that
she
was
whiter
stiller
and
more
unapproachable
of
a
different
clay
in
short
from
other
women
then
however
this
illusion
was
shattered
late
one
afternoon
she
came
down
the
stairs
of
the
house
she
lived
in
and
pausing
at
the
door
looked
up
and
down
the
hot
empty
street
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
no
one
was
in
sight
and
she
was
about
to
turn
away
when
from
where
he
was
watching
in
a
neighbouring
doorway
maurice
saw
the
violinist
come
swiftly
round
the
corner
she
saw
him
too
took
a
few
quick
steps
towards
him
and
believing
herself
unseen
looked
up
in
is
face
as
they
met
and
the
passionate
tenderness
of
the
look
the
sudden
lighting
of
lip
and
eye
racked
the
poor
unwilling
spy
for
days
to
suit
this
abrupt
descent
from
the
pedestal
he
was
obliged
to
carve
a
new
attribute
to
his
idol
and
laboriously
adapt
it
schilsky
this
insolent
boy
was
the
thorn
in
his
side
it
was
schilsky
she
was
oftenest
to
be
met
with
he
was
her
companion
at
the
most
unexpected
hours
and
with
reluctance
maurice
had
to
admit
to
himself
that
she
had
apparently
no
thought
to
spare
for
anyone
else
but
it
did
not
make
any
difference
the
curious
way
in
which
he
felt
towards
her
the
strange
overwhelming
effect
her
face
had
on
him
took
no
account
of
outside
things
though
he
might
never
hope
for
a
word
from
her
though
he
should
learn
in
the
coming
moment
that
she
was
the
promised
wife
he
could
not
for
that
reason
banish
her
from
his
mind
his
feelings
were
not
to
be
put
on
and
off
like
clothes
he
had
no
power
over
them
it
was
simply
a
case
of
accepting
things
as
they
were
and
this
he
sought
to
do
but
his
imagination
made
it
hard
for
him
by
throwing
up
pictures
in
which
schilsky
was
he
saw
him
the
confidant
of
her
joys
and
troubles
he
knew
their
origin
knew
what
key
her
day
was
set
in
if
her
head
ached
if
she
were
tired
or
spiritless
his
hand
was
on
her
brow
the
smallest
events
in
her
life
were
an
open
book
to
him
and
it
was
these
worthless
details
that
maurice
guest
envied
him
most
he
kept
a
tight
hold
on
his
fancy
but
if
as
sometimes
happened
it
slipped
control
and
painted
further
looks
of
the
kind
he
had
seen
exchanged
between
them
a
kiss
or
an
embrace
he
was
as
wretched
as
if
he
had
in
reality
been
present
at
other
times
this
jealous
unrest
was
not
the
bitterest
drop
in
his
cup
it
was
bitterer
to
know
that
she
was
squandering
her
love
on
one
who
was
unworthy
of
it
at
first
from
a
feeling
of
exaggerated
delicacy
he
had
gone
out
of
his
way
to
escape
hearing
schilsky
name
but
this
mood
passed
and
gave
place
to
an
undignified
hankering
to
learn
everything
he
could
concerning
the
young
man
what
he
heard
amounted
to
this
a
talented
rascal
the
best
violinist
the
conservatorium
had
turned
out
for
years
one
to
whom
all
gates
would
open
but
this
but
always
followed
with
a
meaning
smile
and
a
wink
of
the
eye
and
then
came
the
anecdotes
they
had
nothing
in
them
these
soiled
this
perpetual
impecuniosity
this
inability
to
refuse
money
no
matter
whose
the
hand
that
offered
it
this
fine
art
in
the
disregarding
of
established
canons
and
to
maurice
guest
bred
to
sterner
standards
they
seemed
unspeakably
low
and
mean
hours
came
when
he
strove
in
vain
to
understand
her
ignorant
of
these
things
she
could
not
be
was
it
within
the
limits
of
the
possible
that
she
could
overlook
them
and
he
shivered
lest
he
should
be
forced
to
think
less
highly
of
her
ultimately
sending
his
mind
back
over
what
he
had
read
and
heard
drawing
on
his
own
slight
experience
he
came
to
a
compromise
with
himself
he
said
that
most
often
the
best
and
fairest
women
loved
men
who
were
unworthy
of
them
was
it
not
a
weakness
and
a
strength
of
her
sex
to
see
good
where
no
good
was
a
kind
of
divine
frailty
a
wilful
blindness
a
sweet
inability
to
discern
at
times
again
he
felt
almost
content
that
schilsky
was
what
he
was
if
the
day
should
ever
come
when
all
barriers
down
he
maurice
guest
might
be
intimately
associated
with
her
life
if
he
should
ever
have
the
chance
of
proving
to
her
what
real
love
was
what
a
holy
mystic
thing
how
far
removed
from
a
blind
passing
fancy
if
he
might
serve
her
be
her
slave
lay
his
hands
under
her
feet
lead
her
up
and
on
all
suffused
in
a
sunset
of
tenderness
then
she
would
see
that
what
she
had
believed
to
be
love
had
been
nothing
but
a
fata
morgana
a
mirage
of
the
skies
and
he
heard
himself
whispering
words
of
incredible
fondness
to
her
saw
her
listening
with
wonder
in
her
eyes
at
still
other
moments
he
was
ready
to
renounce
every
hope
if
by
doing
so
he
could
add
jot
or
tittle
to
her
happiness
the
further
he
spun
himself
into
his
dreams
however
and
the
better
he
learnt
to
know
her
in
imagination
the
harder
it
grew
to
take
the
first
step
towards
realising
his
wishes
in
those
few
brief
days
when
he
hugged
her
name
to
him
as
a
talisman
he
waited
cheerfully
for
something
to
happen
something
unusual
that
would
bring
him
to
her
notice
a
dropped
handkerchief
a
seat
vacated
for
her
at
a
concert
even
a
timely
accident
but
as
day
after
day
went
by
in
eventless
monotony
he
began
to
cast
about
him
for
human
aid
from
dove
his
daily
companion
dove
of
the
outstretched
paws
of
continual
help
he
now
shrank
away
miss
martin
was
not
to
be
spoken
to
except
in
company
there
was
only
one
person
who
could
assist
him
if
she
would
and
that
was
madeleine
wade
he
called
to
mind
the
hearty
invitation
she
had
given
him
and
reproached
himself
for
not
having
taken
advantage
of
it
one
afternoon
towards
six
he
rang
the
bell
of
her
lodgings
in
the
mozartstrasse
this
was
a
new
street
the
first
blocks
of
which
gave
directly
on
the
gewandhaus
square
but
at
the
further
end
where
she
lived
a
phalanx
of
redbrick
and
stucco
fronts
looked
primly
across
at
a
similar
line
in
the
third
storey
of
one
of
these
houses
madeleine
wade
had
a
single
large
room
the
furniture
of
which
was
so
skilfully
contrived
that
by
day
all
traces
of
the
room
double
calling
were
obliterated
as
he
entered
on
this
first
occasion
she
was
practising
at
a
grand
piano
which
stood
before
one
of
the
windows
she
rose
at
once
and
having
greeted
him
warmly
made
him
sit
down
among
the
comfortable
cushions
that
lined
the
sofa
then
she
took
cups
and
saucers
from
a
cupboard
in
the
wall
and
prepared
tea
over
a
he
soon
felt
quite
at
home
with
her
and
enjoyed
himself
so
well
that
many
such
informal
visits
followed
but
the
fact
was
not
to
be
denied
it
was
her
surroundings
that
attracted
him
rather
than
she
herself
true
he
found
her
frankness
delightfully
refreshing
and
when
he
spoke
of
her
it
was
as
of
an
awfully
good
sort
a
girl
for
madeleine
was
invariably
lively
kind
and
helpful
at
the
same
time
she
was
without
doubt
a
trifle
too
composed
too
sure
of
herself
she
had
too
keen
an
eye
for
human
foibles
she
came
towards
you
with
a
perfectly
natural
openness
and
she
came
all
the
way
there
was
nothing
left
for
you
to
explore
and
when
not
actually
with
her
it
was
easy
to
forget
her
there
was
never
a
look
or
a
smile
never
a
barbed
word
never
a
sudden
spontaneous
gesture
the
vivid
translation
of
a
thought
to
stamp
itself
on
your
memory
but
it
was
only
at
the
outset
that
he
thought
things
like
these
madeleine
wade
had
been
through
experiences
of
the
same
kind
before
and
hardly
a
fortnight
later
they
were
calling
each
other
by
their
christian
names
when
he
came
to
her
towards
evening
tired
and
inclined
to
be
lonely
she
seated
him
in
a
corner
of
the
sofa
and
did
not
ask
him
to
say
much
until
she
made
the
tea
then
when
the
cups
were
steaming
in
front
of
them
she
discussed
sympathetically
with
him
the
progress
of
his
work
she
questioned
him
too
about
his
home
and
family
and
he
read
her
parts
of
his
mother
letters
which
arrived
without
fail
every
tuesday
morning
she
also
drew
from
him
a
more
detailed
account
of
his
previous
life
and
in
this
connection
they
had
several
animated
discussions
about
teaching
a
calling
to
which
madeleine
looked
composedly
forward
to
returning
while
maurice
in
strong
superlative
declared
he
had
rather
force
a
flock
of
sheep
to
walk
in
line
she
told
him
too
some
of
the
gossip
the
musical
quarter
of
the
town
was
rife
with
about
those
in
high
places
and
in
particular
of
the
bitter
rivalry
that
had
grown
up
with
the
years
between
schwarz
and
bendel
the
chief
masters
of
the
piano
if
these
two
met
in
the
street
they
passed
each
other
with
a
stony
stare
if
at
an
abendunterhaltung
a
pupil
of
one
was
to
play
the
other
rose
ostentatiously
and
left
the
hall
she
also
hinted
that
in
order
to
obtain
all
you
wanted
at
the
conservatorium
to
be
favoured
above
your
fellows
it
was
only
necessary
flagrantly
to
bribe
one
of
the
clerks
kleefeld
by
name
who
was
open
to
receive
anything
being
wretchedly
impecunious
and
the
father
of
a
large
family
finding
too
that
maurice
was
bent
on
learning
german
she
who
spoke
the
language
fluently
proposed
that
they
should
read
it
together
and
soon
it
became
their
custom
to
work
through
a
few
pages
of
quintus
fixlein
a
scene
or
two
of
schiller
some
lyrics
of
heine
they
also
began
to
play
duets
symphonies
old
and
new
and
madeleine
took
care
constantly
to
have
something
fresh
and
interesting
at
hand
to
all
this
the
young
man
brought
an
unbounded
zeal
and
if
he
had
had
his
way
they
would
have
gone
on
playing
or
reading
far
into
the
evening
she
smiled
at
his
eagerness
you
absorb
like
a
sponge
when
it
grew
too
dark
to
see
he
confided
to
her
that
his
dearest
wish
was
to
be
a
conductor
he
was
not
yet
clear
how
it
could
be
managed
but
he
was
sure
that
this
was
the
branch
of
his
art
for
which
he
had
most
aptitude
here
she
interrupted
him
do
you
never
write
verses
her
question
seemed
to
him
so
meaningless
that
he
only
laughed
and
went
on
with
what
he
was
saying
for
the
event
of
his
plan
proving
impracticable
at
home
they
had
no
idea
of
it
he
was
training
as
a
but
he
intended
to
miss
no
chance
that
offered
of
learning
how
to
handle
an
orchestra
throughout
these
hours
of
stimulating
companionship
however
he
did
not
lose
sight
of
his
original
purpose
in
going
to
see
madeleine
it
was
only
that
just
the
right
moment
never
seemed
to
come
and
the
name
he
was
so
anxious
to
hear
had
not
once
been
mentioned
between
them
often
in
the
dusk
his
lips
twitched
to
speak
it
but
he
feared
his
own
awkwardness
and
her
quick
tongue
then
too
the
subject
was
usually
far
aside
from
what
they
were
talking
of
and
it
would
have
made
a
ludicrous
impression
to
drag
it
in
by
the
hair
but
one
day
his
patience
was
rewarded
he
had
carelessly
taken
up
a
volume
of
chopin
and
was
on
the
point
of
commenting
upon
it
for
he
had
lately
begun
to
understand
the
difference
between
a
litolff
and
a
mikuli
but
it
slipped
from
his
hand
and
he
was
obliged
to
crawl
under
the
piano
to
pick
it
up
on
a
corner
of
the
cover
in
a
big
black
scrawly
writing
was
the
name
of
marie
louise
dufrayer
he
cleared
his
throat
laid
the
volume
down
took
it
up
again
then
realising
that
the
moment
had
come
he
put
a
bold
face
on
the
matter
i
see
this
belongs
to
miss
dufrayer
he
said
bluntly
and
as
his
companion
answer
was
only
a
careless
yes
louise
forgot
it
the
last
time
she
was
here
he
went
on
without
delay
i
should
like
to
know
miss
dufrayer
madeleine
do
you
think
you
could
introduce
me
to
her
madeleine
who
was
in
the
act
of
taking
down
a
book
from
her
hanging
shelves
turned
and
looked
at
him
he
was
still
red
in
the
face
from
the
exertion
of
stooping
introduce
you
to
louise
she
queried
why
why
do
you
want
to
be
introduced
to
her
oh
i
do
know
for
no
particular
reason
she
sat
down
at
the
table
opened
the
book
and
turned
the
leaves
oh
well
i
daresay
i
can
if
you
wish
it
and
an
opportunity
occurs
if
you
with
me
some
day
when
i
meet
now
shall
we
go
on
with
the
jungfrau
we
were
beginning
the
third
act
i
think
here
it
is
wir
waren
herzensbruder
waffenfreunde
fur
eine
sache
hoben
wir
den
arm
but
maurice
did
not
take
the
book
she
handed
him
across
the
table
wo
you
give
me
a
more
definite
promise
than
that
madeleine
sat
back
in
her
chair
and
folding
her
arms
looked
thoughtfully
at
him
only
a
momentary
silence
followed
his
words
but
in
this
fraction
of
time
a
series
of
impressions
swept
through
her
brain
with
the
continuity
of
a
bird
flight
it
was
clear
to
her
at
once
that
what
prompted
his
insistence
was
not
an
ordinary
curiosity
or
a
passing
whim
in
a
flash
she
understood
that
here
below
the
surface
something
was
at
work
in
him
the
existence
of
which
she
had
not
even
suspected
she
was
more
than
annoyed
with
herself
at
her
own
foolish
obtuseness
she
had
had
these
experiences
before
and
then
as
now
the
object
of
her
interest
had
invariably
been
turned
aside
by
the
first
pretty
silly
face
that
came
his
way
the
main
difference
was
that
she
had
been
more
than
ordinarily
drawn
to
maurice
guest
and
believing
it
impossible
in
this
case
for
anyone
else
to
be
sharing
the
field
with
her
she
had
the
hope
that
he
sought
her
out
for
herself
alone
she
endeavoured
to
learn
more
but
this
time
maurice
was
on
his
guard
and
the
questions
she
put
straight
though
they
were
only
elicited
the
response
that
he
had
seen
miss
dufrayer
shortly
after
arriving
and
had
been
much
struck
by
her
madeleine
brain
travelled
rapidly
backwards
but
if
i
remember
rightly
maurice
we
met
louise
one
day
in
the
scheibenholz
the
first
time
we
went
for
a
walk
together
why
did
you
stop
then
and
be
introduced
to
her
if
you
were
so
anxious
why
do
we
ever
do
foolish
things
her
amazement
was
so
patent
that
he
made
uncomfortable
apology
for
himself
it
is
ridiculous
i
know
he
said
and
coloured
and
it
must
seem
doubly
so
to
you
but
that
i
should
want
to
know
her
nothing
strange
in
that
is
there
you
too
madeleine
have
surely
admired
people
sometimes
some
one
say
who
has
done
a
fine
thing
and
have
felt
that
you
must
know
them
personally
at
all
costs
perhaps
i
have
but
romantic
feelings
of
that
kind
are
sure
to
end
in
smoke
as
a
rule
they
no
foundation
but
our
own
if
you
take
my
advice
maurice
you
will
be
content
to
admire
louise
at
a
distance
think
her
as
pretty
as
you
like
and
imagine
her
to
be
all
that
sweet
and
charming
but
never
mind
about
knowing
her
but
why
on
earth
not
why
nothing
will
come
of
it
that
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
nothing
you
do
understand
i
must
be
do
sit
down
and
fidget
how
long
have
you
been
here
now
nearly
two
months
well
that
long
enough
to
know
something
of
what
going
on
you
must
have
both
seen
and
heard
that
louise
has
no
eyes
for
anyone
but
a
certain
person
to
put
it
bluntly
that
she
is
wrapped
up
in
schilsky
this
has
been
going
on
for
over
a
year
now
and
she
seems
to
grow
more
infatuated
every
day
when
she
first
came
to
leipzig
we
were
friends
she
lived
in
this
neighbourhood
and
i
was
able
to
be
of
service
to
her
now
weeks
go
by
and
i
do
see
her
she
has
broken
with
every
one
for
louise
is
not
a
girl
to
do
things
by
introduce
you
of
course
i
can
but
suppose
it
done
with
all
pomp
and
ceremony
what
will
you
get
from
it
i
know
louise
a
word
or
two
if
her
ladyship
is
in
the
mood
if
not
you
will
be
so
much
thin
air
for
her
and
after
that
a
nod
if
she
meets
you
in
the
street
and
that
all
it
enough
you
easily
but
tell
me
honestly
now
maurice
what
possible
good
can
that
do
you
he
moved
aimlessly
about
the
room
good
must
one
always
look
for
good
in
everything
i
can
see
quite
well
that
from
your
point
of
view
the
whole
thing
must
seem
absurd
i
expect
nothing
whatever
from
it
but
i
going
to
know
her
and
that
all
about
it
still
in
the
same
position
with
folded
arms
madeleine
observed
him
with
unblinking
eyes
and
you
wo
bear
me
a
grudge
if
things
go
badly
i
mean
if
you
are
disappointed
or
dissatisfied
he
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
yes
but
i
know
louise
and
you
do
he
had
picked
up
from
the
the
photograph
of
a
curate
and
he
stared
at
it
as
if
he
had
no
thought
but
to
let
the
mild
features
stamp
themselves
on
his
mind
madeleine
eyes
continued
to
bore
him
through
at
last
out
of
a
silence
she
said
slowly
of
course
i
can
introduce
you
it
done
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
but
as
your
friend
i
think
it
only
right
to
warn
you
what
you
must
expect
for
i
can
see
you
do
understand
in
the
least
and
are
laying
up
a
big
disappointment
for
yourself
however
you
shall
have
your
way
if
only
to
show
you
that
i
am
right
thanks
madeleine
thanks
awfully
they
settled
down
to
read
schiller
but
maurice
made
one
slip
after
another
and
she
let
them
pass
uncorrected
she
was
annoyed
with
herself
afresh
for
having
made
too
much
of
the
matter
for
having
blown
it
up
to
a
fictitious
importance
when
the
wiser
way
would
have
been
to
treat
it
as
of
no
consequence
at
all
the
next
afternoon
he
arrived
with
expectation
in
his
face
but
not
on
this
day
nor
the
next
nor
the
next
again
did
she
bring
the
subject
up
between
them
on
the
fourth
however
as
he
was
leaving
she
said
abruptly
you
must
have
patience
for
a
little
maurice
louise
has
gone
to
dresden
that
why
the
blinds
are
down
he
exclaimed
without
thinking
then
coloured
furiously
at
his
own
words
and
to
smooth
them
over
asked
why
has
she
gone
for
how
long
but
madeleine
caught
him
up
sieh
da
some
one
has
been
playing
sentinel
she
said
in
raillery
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
every
fold
in
his
brain
was
laid
bare
to
her
before
she
answered
she
has
gone
for
a
week
or
ten
days
to
visit
some
friends
who
are
staying
there
he
nodded
and
was
about
to
open
the
door
when
she
added
but
set
your
mind
at
rest
he
is
here
maurice
looked
sharply
up
but
a
minute
or
two
passed
before
the
true
meaning
of
her
words
broke
on
him
he
coloured
again
a
mortifying
habit
he
had
not
outgrown
and
one
which
seemed
to
affect
him
more
in
the
presence
of
madeleine
than
of
anyone
else
it
hardly
a
thing
to
joke
about
joke
who
is
joking
she
asked
and
raised
her
eyebrows
so
high
that
her
forehead
was
filled
with
wrinkles
nothing
was
further
from
my
thoughts
maurice
hesitated
and
stood
undecided
holding
the
doorhandle
then
following
an
impulse
he
turned
and
sat
down
again
madeleine
tell
me
i
would
ask
anyone
but
you
what
sort
of
a
fellow
is
this
schilsky
what
sort
of
a
fellow
she
laughed
sarcastically
to
be
quite
truthful
maurice
the
best
fiddler
the
con
has
turned
out
for
years
now
you
joking
again
as
if
i
did
know
that
everyone
says
the
same
you
want
his
moral
character
well
i
be
equally
candid
or
at
least
i
give
you
my
opinion
of
him
it
another
superlative
just
as
i
consider
him
the
best
violinist
i
also
hold
him
to
be
the
greatest
scamp
in
the
place
and
i
no
objection
to
use
a
stronger
word
if
you
like
i
would
take
his
hand
no
not
if
he
offered
it
to
me
the
last
time
he
was
in
this
room
about
six
months
ago
he
well
let
us
say
he
borrowed
without
a
word
to
me
five
or
six
marks
that
were
lying
loose
on
the
yes
it
a
fact
she
repeated
complacently
eyeing
maurice
dismay
otherwise
oh
otherwise
he
was
born
i
think
with
a
silver
spoon
in
his
mouth
he
has
one
piece
of
luck
after
another
zeppelin
discovered
him
ten
years
ago
on
a
his
father
is
a
smith
in
warsaw
and
brought
him
to
leipzig
he
was
a
prodigy
then
and
a
rich
jewish
banker
took
him
up
and
paid
for
his
education
and
when
he
washed
his
hands
of
him
in
disgust
schaefele
wife
schaefele
is
head
of
the
handelverein
you
know
adopted
him
as
a
son
some
people
say
as
more
than
a
son
for
though
she
was
nearly
forty
she
was
perfectly
crazy
over
him
and
behaved
as
foolishly
as
any
of
the
dozens
of
silly
girls
who
have
lost
their
hearts
to
him
i
suppose
they
are
engaged
said
maurice
after
a
pause
speaking
out
of
his
own
thoughts
do
you
she
asked
with
mild
humour
i
really
never
asked
but
this
is
just
another
example
of
his
good
fortune
when
he
has
worn
out
every
one
else
patience
through
his
dishonest
extravagance
he
picks
up
a
rich
wife
who
is
not
averse
to
supporting
him
before
marriage
maurice
looked
at
her
reproachfully
i
wonder
you
care
to
repeat
such
gossip
it
not
gossip
maurice
every
one
knows
it
louise
makes
no
mystery
of
her
doings
does
care
that
much
what
people
say
while
as
for
him
well
it
enough
to
know
it
schilsky
the
thing
is
an
open
secret
listen
now
and
i
tell
you
how
it
began
just
to
let
you
judge
for
yourself
what
kind
of
a
girl
you
have
to
deal
with
in
louise
and
how
schilsky
behaves
when
he
wants
a
thing
and
whether
such
a
pair
think
a
formal
engagement
necessary
to
their
happiness
when
louise
came
here
a
year
and
a
half
ago
schilsky
was
away
somewhere
with
zeppelin
and
did
get
back
till
a
couple
of
months
afterwards
as
i
said
i
knew
louise
pretty
well
at
that
time
she
had
got
herself
into
trouble
with
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
well
my
lord
returns
he
himself
tells
how
it
happened
it
was
a
thursday
evening
and
a
radius
commemoration
was
going
on
at
the
con
he
went
in
late
and
stood
at
the
back
of
the
hall
louise
was
there
too
just
before
him
and
from
the
first
minute
he
saw
her
he
could
take
his
eyes
off
her
others
who
were
by
say
too
he
seemed
perfectly
fascinated
no
one
can
stare
as
rudely
as
schilsky
and
he
ended
by
making
her
so
uncomfortable
that
she
could
bear
it
any
longer
and
went
out
of
the
hall
he
after
her
and
it
did
take
him
an
hour
to
find
out
all
about
her
the
next
evening
at
an
abend
they
were
both
there
again
it
was
just
like
louise
to
go
and
the
same
thing
was
repeated
she
left
again
before
it
was
over
he
followed
and
this
time
found
her
in
one
of
the
side
corridors
and
there
mind
you
without
a
single
word
having
passed
between
them
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
kissed
her
soundly
half
a
dozen
times
though
they
had
never
once
spoken
to
each
other
he
boasts
of
it
to
this
day
that
same
evening
do
madeleine
please
do
say
any
more
i
do
care
to
hear
it
broke
in
maurice
he
had
flushed
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
at
some
points
of
resemblance
to
his
own
case
then
grown
pale
again
and
now
he
waved
his
arm
meaninglessly
in
the
air
he
is
a
scoundrel
a
a
but
he
recognised
that
he
could
not
condemn
one
without
the
other
and
stopped
short
my
dear
boy
if
i
do
tell
you
other
people
will
and
at
least
you
know
i
mean
well
by
you
besides
she
went
on
not
without
a
touch
of
malice
as
she
eyed
him
sitting
there
spoiling
the
leaves
of
a
book
besides
i
may
as
well
show
you
how
you
have
to
treat
louise
if
you
want
to
make
an
impression
on
her
you
call
him
a
scoundrel
but
what
of
her
believe
me
maurice
she
said
more
seriously
louise
is
not
a
whit
too
good
for
him
they
were
made
for
each
other
and
of
course
he
will
marry
her
eventually
for
the
sake
of
her
money
here
she
paused
and
looked
deliberately
at
him
if
not
for
her
own
this
time
there
was
no
mistaking
the
meaning
of
her
words
madeleine
he
rose
from
his
seat
with
such
force
that
the
table
tilted
but
madeleine
did
not
falter
i
told
you
already
you
know
that
louise
does
care
what
is
said
about
her
as
soon
as
this
unfortunate
affair
began
she
threw
up
the
rooms
she
was
in
at
the
time
and
moved
nearer
the
talstrasse
where
he
lives
rumour
has
it
also
that
she
provided
herself
with
an
accommodating
landlady
who
can
be
blind
and
deaf
when
necessary
how
can
you
repeat
such
atrocious
scandal
he
stared
at
her
in
incredulous
dismay
her
words
were
so
many
arrows
the
points
of
which
remained
sticking
in
him
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
your
not
believing
it
does
affect
the
truth
of
the
story
maurice
it
was
the
talk
of
the
place
when
it
happened
and
you
may
despise
rumour
as
you
will
my
experience
is
a
report
never
springs
up
that
has
some
basis
of
fact
to
go
on
however
small
he
choked
back
with
an
effort
the
eloquent
words
that
came
to
his
lips
of
what
use
was
it
to
make
himself
still
more
ridiculous
in
her
eyes
his
hat
had
fallen
to
the
floor
he
picked
it
up
and
brushed
it
on
his
sleeve
without
knowing
what
he
did
oh
well
of
course
if
you
think
that
he
said
as
coolly
as
he
was
able
nothing
i
could
say
would
make
any
difference
every
one
is
free
to
his
opinions
i
suppose
but
all
the
same
i
must
say
madeleine
he
grew
hot
in
spite
of
himself
you
have
been
her
friend
you
say
you
have
known
her
intimately
and
yet
just
because
she
she
cares
for
this
fellow
in
such
a
way
that
she
sets
caring
for
him
above
being
cautious
why
not
one
woman
in
a
thousand
would
have
the
courage
for
that
sort
of
thing
it
needs
courage
not
to
mind
what
people
no
what
your
friends
imagine
and
how
falsely
they
interpret
what
you
do
besides
one
has
only
to
look
at
her
to
see
how
absurd
it
is
that
face
and
i
know
her
madeleine
i
never
spoken
to
her
and
never
may
yet
i
am
absolutely
certain
that
what
is
said
about
her
is
true
so
certain
that
but
after
all
if
this
is
what
you
think
about
about
it
then
all
i
have
to
say
is
we
had
better
not
discuss
the
subject
again
it
does
no
good
and
we
should
never
be
of
the
same
opinion
not
without
embarrassment
now
that
he
had
said
his
say
he
turned
to
the
door
but
madeleine
was
not
in
the
least
angry
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
said
with
a
smile
yet
gravely
too
agreed
maurice
we
will
not
speak
of
louise
again
he
shunned
madeleine
for
days
after
this
he
was
morose
and
unhappy
and
brooded
darkly
over
the
baseness
of
wagging
tongues
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
come
into
touch
with
slander
that
invisible
hydra
and
straightway
it
seized
upon
the
one
person
to
whom
he
was
not
indifferent
in
this
mood
it
was
a
relief
to
him
that
certain
three
windows
in
the
bruderstrasse
remained
closed
and
shuttered
with
the
load
of
malicious
gossip
fresh
on
his
mind
he
chose
rather
not
to
see
her
he
must
first
accustom
himself
to
it
as
to
the
scar
left
by
a
wound
he
did
not
of
course
believe
what
madeleine
with
her
infernal
frankness
had
told
him
but
the
knowledge
that
such
a
report
was
abroad
depressed
him
unspeakably
it
took
colour
from
the
sky
and
light
from
the
sun
sometimes
in
these
days
as
he
sat
at
his
piano
he
had
a
sudden
fit
of
discouragement
which
made
it
seem
not
worth
while
to
continue
playing
it
was
unthinkable
that
she
could
be
aware
how
busy
scandal
was
with
her
name
and
how
her
careless
acts
were
spied
on
and
misrepresented
and
he
turned
over
in
his
mind
ways
and
means
by
which
she
might
be
induced
to
take
more
thought
for
herself
in
future
he
did
not
believe
it
but
hours
of
distracting
uncertainty
came
none
the
less
when
small
things
which
his
memory
had
stored
up
made
him
go
so
far
as
to
ask
himself
what
if
it
should
be
true
what
then
but
he
had
not
courage
enough
to
face
an
answer
he
put
the
possibility
away
from
him
in
the
extreme
background
of
his
mind
refused
to
let
his
brain
piece
its
observations
together
the
mere
suspicion
was
a
blasphemy
a
blasphemy
against
her
dignified
reserve
against
her
sweet
pale
face
her
supreme
disregard
of
those
about
her
not
thus
would
guilt
have
shown
itself
schilsky
who
was
the
origin
of
all
the
evil
he
made
wide
circuits
to
avoid
he
thought
of
him
at
this
time
with
what
he
believed
to
be
a
feeling
of
purely
personal
antipathy
in
his
most
downcast
moments
he
had
swift
and
foolish
visions
publicly
executing
vengeance
on
him
but
if
a
moment
later
he
saw
the
violinist
red
hair
or
big
hat
before
him
in
the
street
he
turned
aside
as
though
the
other
had
been
once
however
when
he
was
going
up
the
steps
of
the
conservatorium
and
schilsky
in
leaping
down
pushed
carelessly
against
him
he
returned
the
knock
so
rudely
and
swore
with
such
downrightness
that
in
spite
of
his
hurry
schilsky
stopped
and
fixed
him
and
with
equal
vehemence
damned
him
for
a
fool
of
an
englishman
his
despondency
spread
like
a
weed
a
furious
impatience
overcame
him
too
at
the
thought
of
the
innumerable
hours
he
would
be
forced
to
spend
at
the
piano
day
in
day
out
for
months
to
come
before
the
result
could
be
compared
with
the
achievements
even
of
many
a
as
the
private
lessons
schwarz
gave
were
too
expensive
for
him
he
decided
as
a
compromise
to
take
a
course
of
extra
lessons
with
furst
who
prepared
pupils
for
the
master
and
was
quite
willing
to
come
to
terms
in
other
words
who
taught
for
what
he
could
get
once
a
week
then
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
maurice
climbed
the
steep
winding
stair
of
the
house
in
the
brandvorwerkstrasse
where
furst
lived
with
his
mother
it
was
so
dark
on
this
stair
that
in
dull
weather
lamps
burnt
all
day
long
on
the
different
landings
to
its
convolutions
in
its
unaired
corners
clung
what
seemed
to
be
the
stale
accumulated
smells
of
years
and
these
were
continually
reinforced
since
every
day
at
dinnertime
the
various
all
of
which
gave
on
the
stair
were
opened
to
let
the
piercing
odours
of
cooking
escape
the
house
like
the
majority
of
its
kind
in
this
relatively
new
street
was
divided
into
countless
small
lodgings
three
families
with
three
rooms
apiece
lived
on
each
storey
and
on
the
fifth
floor
at
the
top
of
the
house
the
same
number
of
rooms
was
let
out
singly
part
of
the
third
storey
was
occupied
by
a
and
between
him
and
the
fursts
above
waged
perpetual
war
one
of
those
petty
unending
wars
that
can
only
arise
and
be
kept
up
when
as
here
such
heterogeneous
elements
are
forced
to
live
side
by
side
under
one
roof
the
fancier
although
his
business
was
nominally
in
the
town
had
enough
of
his
wares
beside
him
to
make
his
house
a
lively
humming
kind
of
place
and
the
strife
dated
back
to
a
day
when
the
door
standing
temptingly
ajar
peter
the
fursts
lean
cat
had
sneaked
stealthily
in
upon
this
to
him
enchanted
ground
and
according
to
the
fancier
had
caused
the
death
from
fright
of
a
delicate
canary
although
the
culprit
had
done
nothing
more
than
sit
before
the
cage
licking
his
lips
this
had
happened
several
years
ago
but
each
party
was
still
fertile
in
planning
annoyances
for
the
other
and
the
females
did
not
bow
when
they
met
on
the
fourth
floor
next
the
fursts
lived
a
pale
harassed
teacher
with
a
family
which
had
long
since
outgrown
its
accommodation
for
the
wife
was
perpetually
in
childbed
and
cots
and
cradles
were
the
chief
furniture
of
the
house
as
the
critical
moments
of
her
career
drew
nigh
the
frau
lehrer
complained
with
an
aggravated
bitterness
of
the
unceasing
music
that
went
on
behind
the
thin
partition
and
this
grievance
together
with
the
racy
items
of
gossip
left
behind
the
midwife
annual
visit
like
a
trail
of
smoke
provided
her
and
furst
mother
with
infinite
food
for
talk
they
were
thick
friends
again
a
few
minutes
after
a
scene
so
lively
that
blows
seemed
imminent
and
they
met
every
morning
on
the
landing
where
with
broom
or
child
in
hand
they
stood
gossiping
by
the
hour
when
maurice
rang
frau
furst
opened
the
door
to
him
herself
having
first
cautiously
examined
him
through
the
kitchen
window
drying
her
hands
on
her
apron
she
ushered
him
through
the
tiny
entry
a
place
of
dangers
as
it
was
and
lumbered
with
chests
and
presses
into
franz
room
the
best
room
of
the
house
here
were
collected
a
red
plush
suite
which
was
the
pride
of
frau
furst
heart
and
all
the
round
yellowing
family
photographs
here
too
stood
the
bechstein
pile
upon
pile
of
music
a
couple
of
a
bust
of
schubert
a
faded
framed
diploma
for
years
assuredly
the
windows
had
never
been
thrown
wide
open
the
odours
of
stale
coffee
and
forgotten
dinners
of
stove
and
warmed
wood
of
piano
music
and
beeswax
all
these
lay
as
it
were
in
streaks
in
the
atmosphere
and
made
it
heavy
and
a
willing
listener
was
worth
more
than
gold
to
frau
furst
and
here
the
first
time
he
came
while
waiting
for
franz
maurice
heard
in
detail
the
history
of
the
family
the
father
had
been
an
oboist
in
the
gewandhaus
orchestra
and
had
died
a
few
years
previously
of
a
chill
incurred
after
a
performance
of
die
meistersinger
at
his
death
it
had
fallen
on
franz
to
support
the
family
and
thanks
to
schwarz
aid
and
influence
franz
was
able
to
get
as
many
pupils
as
he
had
time
to
teach
it
was
easy
to
see
that
this
her
eldest
son
was
the
apple
of
frau
furst
eye
her
other
children
seemed
to
be
there
only
to
meet
his
needs
his
lightest
wish
was
law
each
additional
pupil
that
sought
him
out
was
a
fresh
tribute
to
his
genius
each
one
that
left
him
no
matter
after
how
long
was
unthankful
and
a
traitor
for
the
nights
on
which
his
quartet
met
at
the
house
she
prepared
as
another
woman
would
for
a
personal
fete
and
she
watched
the
candles
grow
shorter
without
a
tinge
of
regret
when
franz
played
at
an
abendunterhaltung
the
family
turned
out
in
a
body
schwarz
was
a
god
on
whom
their
welfare
depended
and
it
was
necessary
to
propitiate
him
by
a
quarterly
visit
on
a
sunday
morning
when
over
wine
and
biscuits
she
wept
real
and
feigned
tears
of
gratitude
in
this
careworn
woman
who
was
seldom
to
be
seen
but
in
petticoat
and
heelless
felt
shoes
who
her
whole
life
long
had
been
little
better
than
a
domestic
servant
in
her
there
existed
a
devotion
to
art
which
had
never
wavered
it
would
have
seemed
to
her
contrary
to
nature
that
franz
should
be
anything
but
a
musician
and
it
was
also
quite
in
the
order
of
things
for
them
to
be
poor
two
younger
boys
who
were
still
at
school
gave
up
all
their
leisure
time
to
music
they
had
never
in
their
lives
tumbled
round
a
football
or
swung
a
bat
and
franz
believed
that
the
elder
would
prove
a
skilful
violinist
of
the
little
girls
one
had
a
pure
voice
and
a
good
ear
and
was
to
be
a
singer
for
before
this
juggernaut
prejudice
went
down
had
anyone
suggested
to
frau
furst
that
her
daughter
should
be
a
clerk
even
a
teacher
she
would
have
flung
up
hands
of
horror
but
music
that
was
a
different
matter
it
was
moreover
the
single
one
of
the
arts
in
which
this
staunch
advocate
of
womanliness
granted
her
sex
a
share
ask
franz
she
said
to
maurice
franz
knows
he
will
explain
all
women
can
do
is
to
reproduce
what
some
one
else
has
thought
or
felt
as
an
immortal
example
of
the
limits
set
by
sex
she
invariably
fell
back
on
clara
schumann
with
whom
she
had
more
than
once
come
into
personal
contact
in
her
youth
frau
furst
had
had
a
clear
soprano
voice
and
to
maurice
interest
she
told
him
how
she
had
sometimes
been
sent
for
to
the
schumann
house
in
the
inselstrasse
to
sing
robert
songs
for
him
clara
accompanied
me
she
said
relating
this
the
great
reminiscence
of
her
life
and
he
was
there
too
although
i
never
saw
him
face
to
face
he
was
too
shy
for
that
but
he
was
behind
a
screen
and
sometimes
he
would
call
must
alter
that
it
is
too
high
or
quicker
sometimes
even
her
motherly
ambitions
for
franz
knew
no
bounds
one
of
the
few
diversions
she
allowed
herself
was
a
visit
to
the
theatre
when
franz
had
tickets
given
to
him
when
one
of
her
favourite
operas
was
performed
or
on
the
anniversary
of
her
husband
death
and
on
such
occasions
she
pointed
out
to
the
younger
children
the
links
that
bound
and
would
yet
bind
them
to
the
great
house
that
was
your
father
seat
she
reminded
them
every
time
the
second
row
from
the
end
he
came
in
at
the
door
to
the
left
and
that
pointing
to
the
conductor
raised
chair
is
where
franz
will
sit
some
day
for
she
dreamed
of
franz
in
all
the
glory
of
kapellmeister
saw
him
swinging
the
little
stick
that
dominated
the
singers
and
players
alike
and
the
children
hanging
over
the
high
gallery
shuffling
their
restless
feet
thus
had
their
path
as
dearly
traced
for
them
their
destiny
as
surely
sealed
as
any
heroes
of
antiquity
late
one
afternoon
about
this
time
franz
might
have
been
found
together
with
his
friends
krafft
and
schilsky
at
the
latter
lodging
in
the
talstrasse
he
was
astride
a
chair
over
the
back
of
which
he
had
folded
his
arms
and
his
chubby
rubicund
face
glistened
with
moisture
in
the
middle
of
the
room
at
the
corner
of
a
bare
deal
table
that
was
piled
with
loose
music
and
manuscript
schilsky
sat
improving
and
correcting
the
tails
and
bodies
of
hastily
made
notes
he
was
still
in
his
nightshirt
over
which
he
had
thrown
coat
and
trousers
and
wide
open
at
the
neck
it
exposed
to
the
waist
a
skin
of
the
dead
whiteness
peculiar
to
people
his
face
on
the
other
hand
was
sallow
and
unfresh
and
the
reddish
rims
of
the
eyes
and
the
coarsely
mouth
contrasted
strikingly
with
the
general
youthfulness
of
his
appearance
he
had
the
true
musician
head
round
as
a
with
a
vast
bumpy
forehead
on
which
the
soft
fluffy
hair
began
far
back
and
stood
out
like
a
nimbus
his
eyes
were
either
desperately
dreamy
or
desperately
sharp
never
normally
attentive
or
at
rest
his
blunted
nose
and
chin
were
so
short
as
to
make
the
face
look
a
carefully
tended
young
moustache
stood
straight
out
along
his
cheeks
he
had
large
slender
hands
and
quick
movements
the
air
of
the
room
was
like
a
thin
grey
veiling
for
all
three
puffed
hard
at
cigarettes
without
removing
his
from
between
his
teeth
schilsky
related
an
adventure
of
the
night
before
he
spoke
in
jerks
with
a
strong
lisp
intent
on
what
he
was
doing
than
on
what
he
was
saying
do
you
think
he
budge
he
asked
in
a
thick
spluttery
way
not
he
till
nearly
two
and
then
i
could
get
him
along
he
thought
it
was
eleven
and
wanted
to
relieve
himself
at
every
corner
to
irritate
an
imaginary
bobby
he
disputed
with
them
too
heavens
what
sport
it
was
at
last
i
dragged
him
up
here
and
got
him
on
the
sofa
off
he
rolls
again
so
i
let
him
lie
he
did
disturb
me
heinrich
krafft
the
hero
of
the
episode
lay
on
the
short
uncomfortable
sofa
with
the
for
a
blanket
in
answer
to
schilsky
he
said
faintly
without
opening
his
eyes
nothing
would
you
are
an
ox
when
i
wake
this
morning
with
a
mouth
like
gum
arabic
he
sits
there
as
if
he
had
not
stirred
all
night
then
to
bed
and
snores
till
midday
through
all
the
hellish
light
and
noise
here
furst
could
not
resist
making
a
little
joke
he
announced
himself
by
a
the
click
of
a
clock
about
to
strike
he
got
to
make
the
most
of
his
liberty
he
does
often
get
off
duty
we
know
we
know
he
laughed
tonelessly
and
winked
at
krafft
krafft
quoted
in
der
woche
zwier
now
you
fellows
shut
up
said
schilsky
it
was
plain
that
banter
of
this
kind
was
not
disagreeable
to
him
at
the
same
time
he
was
just
at
the
moment
too
engrossed
to
have
more
than
half
an
car
for
what
was
said
with
his
eyes
close
to
the
paper
he
was
listening
with
all
his
might
to
some
harmonies
that
his
fingers
played
on
the
table
when
a
few
minutes
later
he
rose
and
stretched
the
stiffness
from
his
limbs
his
face
having
lost
its
expression
of
rapt
concentration
seemed
suddenly
to
have
grown
younger
he
set
about
dressing
himself
by
drawing
off
his
nightshirt
over
his
head
at
a
word
from
him
furst
sprang
to
collect
utensils
for
making
coffee
heinrich
krafft
opened
his
eyes
and
followed
their
movements
and
the
look
he
had
for
schilsky
was
as
warily
watchful
as
a
cat
schilsky
an
undeveloped
hercules
he
was
narrow
in
proportion
to
his
height
and
still
naked
to
the
waist
took
some
bottles
from
a
long
line
of
washes
and
perfumes
that
stood
on
the
washstand
and
crossing
to
an
elegant
mirror
hung
beside
the
window
lathered
his
chin
it
was
a
peculiarity
of
his
only
to
be
able
to
attend
thoroughly
to
one
thing
at
a
time
and
a
string
of
witticisms
uttered
by
furst
passed
unheeded
but
krafft
first
words
made
him
start
having
watched
him
for
some
time
the
latter
said
slowly
i
say
old
fellow
are
you
sure
it
all
square
about
lulu
and
this
dresden
business
razor
in
hand
schilsky
turned
and
looked
at
him
as
he
did
so
he
coloured
and
answered
with
an
haste
of
course
i
am
i
made
her
go
she
did
want
to
that
a
trick
the
young
man
scowled
and
thrust
out
his
do
you
think
not
up
to
their
tricks
do
you
want
to
teach
me
how
to
manage
a
woman
i
tell
you
i
sent
her
away
he
tried
to
continue
shaving
but
was
visibly
uneasy
well
if
you
wo
believe
me
he
said
with
sudden
anger
though
neither
of
the
others
had
spoken
now
where
the
deuce
is
that
letter
he
rummaged
among
the
music
and
papers
on
the
table
in
chaotic
drawers
beneath
dirty
on
the
washstand
between
door
and
stove
through
a
kind
of
rubbishheap
that
had
formed
with
time
of
articles
of
dress
spoiled
sheets
of
soiled
linen
empty
bottles
and
boots
countless
boots
single
and
in
pairs
when
he
had
found
what
he
looked
for
he
ran
his
eyes
down
the
page
as
if
he
were
going
to
read
it
aloud
then
however
he
changed
his
mind
a
boyish
gratification
overspread
his
face
and
tossing
the
letter
to
krafft
he
bade
them
read
it
for
themselves
furst
leaned
over
the
end
of
the
sofa
it
was
written
in
english
in
a
bold
scrawly
hand
and
ran
without
date
or
heading
my
own
dearest
now
only
four
days
more
i
count
them
morning
and
night
i
am
good
for
nothing
my
thoughts
are
always
with
you
yesterday
at
the
gallery
i
sat
alone
in
the
room
where
the
madonna
is
pretending
enthusiasm
while
the
rest
went
to
holbein
and
read
your
letter
over
and
over
again
but
it
made
me
a
little
unhappy
too
for
i
soon
found
out
that
you
had
written
it
at
three
different
times
is
it
really
so
hard
to
write
to
lulu
have
you
worked
better
for
want
of
interruption
my
damned
interruptions
as
you
called
them
last
week
when
you
were
so
angry
with
me
shall
you
have
a
great
deal
to
show
me
when
i
come
home
no
say
you
will
or
i
shall
hate
zarathustra
more
than
i
do
already
and
now
only
till
friday
this
time
you
will
meet
me
yes
and
not
come
to
the
station
an
hour
late
as
you
said
you
did
last
time
if
you
are
not
there
i
warn
you
i
shall
throw
myself
under
the
train
i
am
writing
to
grunhut

flowers

money
in
one
of
the
vases
on
the
oh

we
shall
have
such
a
happy
evening
if
only
you
will
and
i
shall
never
leave
you
again
never
again
your
own
loving
furst
could
not
make
out
much
of
this
he
was
still
spelling
through
the
first
paragraph
when
krafft
had
finished
schilsky
who
had
gone
on
dressing
kept
a
sharp
eye
on
his
friends
particularly
on
krafft
well
he
asked
eagerly
as
the
letter
was
laid
down
krafft
was
silent
but
furst
kissed
his
to
a
large
hanging
photograph
of
the
girl
in
question
and
was
facetious
on
the
subject
of
dark
sallow
women
and
you
heinz
what
do
you
say
demanded
schilsky
with
growing
impatience
still
krafft
did
not
reply
and
schilsky
was
mastered
by
a
violent
irritation
why
the
devil
ca
you
open
your
mouth
what
the
matter
with
you
have
you
anything
like
that
to
show
you
joseph
you
krafft
let
a
waxen
hand
drop
over
the
side
of
the
sofa
and
trail
on
the
floor
the
letters
were
burned
dear
boy
when
you
appeared
he
closed
his
eyes
and
smiled
seeming
to
remember
something
but
a
moment
later
he
fixed
schilsky
sharply
and
asked
you
want
my
opinion
do
you
of
course
i
do
said
schilsky
and
flung
things
about
the
room
lulu
said
krafft
with
deliberation
lulu
is
getting
you
under
her
thumb
the
other
sprang
up
swore
and
aimed
a
boot
which
he
had
been
vainly
trying
to
put
on
the
wrong
foot
at
a
bottle
that
protruded
from
the
me
me
under
her
thumb
he
spluttered
his
lips
became
more
marked
under
excitement
i
should
like
to
see
her
try
it
you
do
know
me
you
do
know
lulu
i
am
her
master
i
tell
you
she
ca
call
her
soul
her
own
and
yet
said
krafft
unmoved
it
a
fact
all
the
same
schilsky
applied
a
pair
of
curling
tongs
to
his
hair
at
such
a
degree
of
heat
that
a
lock
frizzled
and
came
off
in
his
hand
his
anger
redoubled
is
it
my
fault
that
she
acts
like
a
is
that
what
you
call
being
under
her
thumb
he
cried
furst
tried
to
conciliate
him
and
to
make
peace
you
a
lucky
dog
old
fellow
and
you
know
you
are
we
all
know
it
in
spite
of
occasional
tantaras
but
you
would
be
still
luckier
if
you
took
a
friend
sound
advice
and
got
you
to
the
registrar
ten
minutes
before
the
registrar
and
everything
would
be
different
then
she
might
play
up
as
she
liked
you
would
be
master
in
earnest
registrar
echoed
krafft
with
deep
scorn
listen
to
the
ape
not
if
we
can
hinder
it
when
he
fool
enough
for
that
i
know
him
it
will
be
with
something
fresher
and
less
faded
something
with
the
bloom
still
on
it
schilsky
winced
as
though
he
had
been
struck
her
age
she
was
eight
years
older
than
he
was
one
of
his
sorest
points
oh
come
on
now
said
furst
as
he
poured
out
the
coffee
hardly
fair
she
not
so
young
as
she
might
be
it
true
but
no
one
can
hold
a
candle
to
her
still
lulu
is
lulu
ten
minutes
before
the
registrar
continued
krafft
meditatively
shaking
his
head
and
for
the
rest
of
life
chains
and
convention
and
security
which
stales
and
custom
which
satiates
oh
no
i
am
not
for
matrimony
schilsky
evaporated
in
a
peal
of
boisterous
laughter
yes
and
tell
us
why
chaste
joseph
tell
us
why
he
cried
throwing
a
brush
at
his
friend
or
go
to
the
devil
where
you
at
home
krafft
warded
off
the
brush
look
here
he
said
confess
have
you
kissed
another
girl
for
months
have
you
had
a
single
but
schilsky
only
winked
provokingly
having
finished
laughing
he
said
with
emphasis
but
after
lulu
they
are
all
tame
lulu
is
lulu
and
that
the
beginning
and
end
of
the
matter
exactly
my
opinion
said
furst
and
yet
boys
if
i
wanted
to
make
your
mouths
water
i
could
he
closed
one
eye
and
smacked
his
lips
i
know
of
something
something
young
and
blond
and
dimpled
and
round
round
as
a
he
made
descriptive
movements
of
the
hand
with
a
neck
boys
a
neck
i
say
here
in
sheer
ecstasy
he
stuck
fast
and
could
get
no
further
schilsky
roared
anew
he
knows
of
something
so
he
does
he
cried
furst
pronounced
tastes
were
a
standing
joke
among
them
show

us
old
man

her
to
us
where
are

day
over
come
along
i
on
for
a
spree
up
with
you
joseph
he
was
ready
come
forth
from
the
utter
confusion
around
him
like
a
god
from
a
cloud
he
wore
light
grey
clothes
a
loosely
knotted
bright
blue
tie
with
floating
ends
and
conspicuous
white
spots
and
buttoned
boots
of
brown
kid
hair
and
handkerchief
were
strongly
scented
krafft
having
been
prevailed
on
to
rise
made
no
further
toilet
than
that
of
dipping
his
head
in
a
basin
of
water
which
stood
on
the
tail
of
the
grand
piano
his
hair
emerged
a
mass
of
dripping
ringlets
covetously
eyed
by
his
companions
they
walked
along
the
streets
schilsky
between
the
others
whom
he
overtopped
by
head
and
shoulders
three
young
rebels
out
against
the
philistines
three
bursting
charges
of
animal
spirits
there
was
to
be
a
concert
that
evening
at
the
conservatorium
and
through
vestibule
and
which
for
this
reason
were
unusually
crowded
the
young
men
made
a
kind
of
triumphal
progress
especially
schilsky
not
a
girl
young
or
old
but
peddled
for
a
word
or
a
look
from
him
and
he
was
only
too
prodigal
of
insolently
expressive
glances
whispered
greetings
and
warm
pressures
of
the
hand
the
open
flattery
and
bold
adoration
of
which
he
was
the
object
mounted
to
his
head
he
felt
secure
in
his
freedom
and
brimful
of
selfconfidence
and
as
the
three
of
them
walked
back
to
the
town
his
exhilaration
a
sheer
excess
of
was
no
longer
to
be
kept
within
decent
bounds
wait
he
cried
suddenly
as
they
were
passing
the
gewandhaus
wait
a
minute
see
me
make
that
woman
there
take
a
fit
he
ran
across
the
road
to
the
opposite
pavement
where
the
only
person
in
sight
a
stout
woman
was
dragging
slowly
along
her
arms
full
of
parcels
and
planting
himself
directly
in
front
of
her
so
that
she
was
forced
to
stop
he
seized
both
her
hands
and
worked
them
up
and
down
now
upon
my
soul
who
would
have
thought
of
seeing
you
here
you
baggage
you
he
cried
vociferously
the
woman
was
speechless
from
amazement
her
packages
fell
to
the
ground
and
she
gazed
at
the
lad
before
her
making
at
the
same
time
vain
attempts
to
free
her
hands
no
this
really
is
luck
he
went
on
holding
her
fast
come
a
kiss
my
duck
just
one
ein
kusschen
in
ehren
you
know
and
in
very
fact
he
leaned
forward
and
pecked
at
her
cheek
the
blood
dyed
her
face
and
she
panted
with
rage
you
young
scoundrel
she
gasped
you
impertinent
young
dog
give
you
in
charge
i
i
report
you
to
the
police
let
me
go
this
instant
this
very
instant
do
you
hear
or
i
scream
for
help
the
other
two
had
come
over
to
enjoy
the
fun
schilsky
turned
to
them
with
a
comical
air
of
dismay
and
waved
his
arm
well
i
declare
if
i
have
been
and
made
a
mistake
he
exclaimed
and
slapped
his
forehead
i
out
by
i
do
know
how
much
by
twenty
years
at
least
no
thank
you
madam
keep
your
kisses
you
much
too
old
and
ugly
for
me
he
flourished
his
big
hat
in
her
face
pirouetted
on
his
heel
and
the
three
of
them
went
down
the
street
hallooing
with
laughter
they
had
supper
together
at
the
bavaria
schilsky
standing
treat
for
they
had
gone
by
way
of
the
bruderstrasse
where
he
called
in
to
investigate
the
vase
mentioned
in
the
letter
afterwards
they
commenced
an
informal
wandering
from
one
haunt
to
another
now
by
themselves
now
with
stray
acquaintances
krafft
who
was
still
enfeebled
by
the
previous
night
and
who
under
the
best
of
circumstances
could
not
carry
as
much
as
his
friends
was
the
first
to
give
in
for
a
time
they
got
him
about
between
them
then
furst
grew
obstreperous
and
wanted
to
pour
his
beer
on
the
floor
as
soon
as
it
was
set
before
him
so
that
they
were
put
out
of
two
places
in
the
second
of
which
they
left
krafft
but
the
better
half
of
the
night
was
over
before
schilsky
was
comfortably
drunk
and
in
a
state
to
unbosom
himself
to
a
sympathetic
waitress
about
the
hardship
it
was
to
be
bound
to
some
one
older
than
yourself
he
shed
tears
of
pity
at
his
lot
and
was
extremely
communicative
korper
ihnen
korper
but
old
old
a
jahr
older
than
he
was
and
desperately
jealous
it
too
bad
such
a
nice
young
man
as
you
are
said
the
mamsell
who
herself
not
very
sober
was
sitting
at
ease
on
his
knee
swinging
her
legs
but
you
nice
ones
are
always
treat
her
as
she
deserves
my
chuck
and
make
no
bones
about
it
just
let
her
rip
and
you
stick
to
me
vi
one
cold
windy
afternoon
when
dust
was
stirring
and
rain
seemed
imminent
maurice
guest
walked
with
bent
head
and
his
hat
pulled
over
his
eyes
he
was
returning
from
the
zeitzerstrasse
where
in
a
photographer
he
had
a
few
days
earlier
discovered
a
large
photograph
of
louise
this
was
a
source
of
great
pleasure
to
him
here
no
laws
of
breeding
or
delicacy
hindered
him
from
gazing
at
her
as
often
as
he
chose
on
this
particular
day
whether
he
had
looked
too
long
or
whether
the
unrest
of
the
weather
the
sense
of
something
impending
the
dusty
dryness
that
craved
rain
had
got
into
his
blood
and
disquieted
him
whatever
it
was
he
felt
restless
and
sick
for
news
of
her
and
at
this
very
moment
was
on
his
way
to
madeleine
in
the
foolish
hope
of
hearing
her
name
but
a
little
adventure
befell
him
which
made
him
forget
his
intention
he
was
about
to
turn
the
corner
of
a
street
when
a
sudden
blast
of
wind
swept
round
bearing
with
it
some
half
dozen
single
sheets
of
music
for
a
moment
they
whirled
high
then
sank
fluttering
to
the
ground
only
to
rise
again
and
race
one
another
along
the
road
maurice
instinctively
gave
chase
but
it
was
not
easy
to
catch
them
no
sooner
had
he
secured
one
than
the
next
was
out
of
his
reach
meanwhile
their
owner
a
young
and
very
pretty
girl
looked
on
and
laughed
without
making
any
effort
to
help
him
and
the
more
he
exerted
himself
the
more
she
laughed
in
one
hand
she
was
carrying
a
in
the
other
a
velvet
muff
which
now
and
again
she
raised
to
her
lips
as
if
to
conceal
her
mirth
it
was
a
graceful
movement
but
an
unnecessary
one
for
her
laughter
was
of
that
charming
kind
which
never
gives
offence
and
besides
that
although
it
was
continuous
it
was
neither
hearty
enough
nor
frank
enough
to
be
unbecoming
the
face
was
well
under
control
she
stood
there
with
her
head
slightly
on
one
side
and
the
parted
lips
showed
both
rows
of
small
even
teeth
but
the
smile
was
unvarying
and
in
spite
of
her
merriment
her
eyes
did
not
for
an
instant
quit
the
young
man
face
as
he
darted
to
and
fro
maurice
could
not
help
laughing
himself
red
and
out
of
breath
though
he
was
now
for
the
last
one
he
said
in
german
at
these
words
she
seemed
more
amused
than
ever
i
do
speak
german
she
answered
in
english
with
a
strong
american
accent
having
captured
all
the
sheets
maurice
tried
to
arrange
them
for
her
it
my
kayser
she
explained
with
a
quick
upward
glance
adding
the
next
minute
with
a
fresh
ripple
of
laughter
he
all
to
pieces
you
have
too
much
to
carry
said
maurice
on
such
a
windy
day
too
that
what
joan
said
joan
is
my
sister
she
continued
but
i
guess
it
so
cold
this
afternoon
i
had
to
bring
a
muff
along
if
my
fingers
are
stiff
i
ca
play
and
then
herr
becker
is
angry
but
she
laughed
again
as
she
spoke
and
it
was
plain
that
the
master
wrath
did
not
exactly
incite
fear
joan
always
comes
along
but
she
sick
will
you
let
me
help
you
asked
maurice
and
a
moment
later
he
was
walking
at
her
side
she
handed
over
music
and
violin
to
him
without
a
trace
of
hesitation
and
as
they
went
along
the
promenade
she
talked
to
him
with
as
little
embarrassment
as
though
they
were
old
acquaintances
it
was
so
kind
of
him
to
help
her
she
thought
she
could
imagine
how
she
would
ever
have
got
home
without
him
alone
against
the
wind
and
she
was
perfectly
sure
he
must
be
american
no
one
but
an
american
would
be
so
nice
when
maurice
denied
this
she
laughed
very
much
indeed
and
was
not
sure
this
being
the
case
whether
she
could
like
him
or
not
as
a
rule
she
did
like
english
people
they
were
stiff
and
horrid
and
were
always
wanting
either
to
be
introduced
or
to
shake
hands
here
she
carried
her
muff
up
to
her
lips
again
and
her
eyes
shone
mischievously
at
him
over
the
dark
velvet
maurice
had
never
known
anyone
so
easily
moved
to
laughter
whenever
she
spoke
she
laughed
and
she
laughed
at
everything
he
said
off
the
promenade
where
the
trees
were
of
a
marvellous
pale
green
they
turned
into
a
street
of
high
spacious
houses
the
dark
lines
of
which
were
here
and
there
broken
by
an
arched
gateway
or
the
delicate
tints
of
a
spring
garden
to
a
window
in
one
of
the
largest
houses
maurice
little
friend
looked
up
and
smiled
and
nodded
there
my
sister
the
young
man
looked
too
and
saw
a
dark
girl
who
when
she
found
four
eyes
fixed
on
her
abruptly
drew
in
her
head
and
as
abruptly
put
it
out
again
leaning
her
two
hands
on
the
sill
she
wondering
who
it
is
said
maurice
companion
gleefully
then
turning
her
face
up
she
made
a
of
her
hands
and
cried
it
all
right
now
i
must
run
right
up
and
tell
her
about
it
she
said
to
maurice
perhaps
she
scold
joan
is
very
particular
thank
you
ever
so
much
for
being
so
good
to
me
oh
wo
you
tell
me
your
name
the
very
next
morning
brought
him
a
small
pink
note
faintly
scented
the
pointed
handwriting
was
still
childish
but
there
was
a
coquettish
flourish
beneath
the
pretty
signature
ephie
cayhill
besides
a
graceful
word
of
thanks
she
wrote
we
are
at
home
every
sunday
mamma
would
be
very
pleased
maurice
did
not
scruple
to
call
the
following
week
and
on
doing
so
found
himself
in
the
midst
of
one
of
those
coteries
which
spring
up
in
all
large
continental
towns
foreigners
were
not
excluded
maurice
discovered
two
or
three
of
his
german
friends
awkwardly
balancing
their
cups
on
their
knees
in
order
however
to
gain
access
to
the
circle
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
have
a
smattering
of
english
they
had
also
to
be
flint
against
any
open
or
covert
fun
that
might
be
made
of
them
or
their
country
and
above
all
to
be
skilled
in
the
art
of
looking
amiable
while
these
visitors
from
other
lands
heatedly
readjusted
to
their
own
satisfaction
all
that
did
not
please
them
in
the
life
and
laws
of
this
country
that
was
temporarily
their
home
cayhill
was
a
handsome
woman
who
led
a
comfortable
vegetable
existence
and
found
it
a
task
to
rise
from
the
plump
her
pleasant
features
were
slack
and
in
those
moments
of
life
which
called
for
a
sudden
decision
they
wore
the
helpless
bewilderment
of
a
woman
who
has
never
been
required
to
think
for
herself
her
grasp
on
practical
matters
was
rendered
the
more
lax
too
by
her
being
an
immoderate
reader
who
fed
on
novels
from
morning
till
night
and
slept
with
a
page
turned
down
beside
her
bed
she
was
for
ever
lost
in
the
joys
or
sorrows
of
some
fictitious
person
and
in
consequence
remained
for
the
most
part
completely
ignorant
of
what
was
going
on
around
her
when
she
did
happen
to
become
conscious
of
her
surroundings
she
was
callous
or
merely
indifferent
to
them
for
compared
with
romance
life
was
dull
and
diffuse
it
lacked
the
wilful
simplicity
the
exaggerative
omissions
and
forcible
perspectives
which
make
up
art
in
other
words
life
demanded
that
unceasing
work
of
selection
and
rejection
which
it
is
the
duty
to
perform
for
his
readers
all
novels
were
fish
to
cayhill
net
she
lived
in
a
world
of
intrigue
and
excitement
and
seated
in
her
by
the
window
was
generally
as
remote
from
her
family
as
though
she
were
in
timbuctoo
there
was
a
difference
of
ten
years
in
age
between
her
daughters
and
it
was
the
younger
of
the
two
whose
education
was
being
completed
johanna
the
elder
had
been
a
disappointment
to
her
mother
left
to
her
own
devices
at
an
impressionable
age
the
girl
had
developed
bookish
tastes
at
the
cost
of
her
appearance
influenced
by
a
tutor
of
her
brothers
she
had
read
huxley
and
haeckel
goethe
and
schopenhauer
her
wish
had
been
for
a
university
career
but
she
was
not
of
a
nature
and
when
cayhill
who
felt
her
world
toppling
about
her
ears
at
the
mention
of
such
a
thing
said
not
while
i
live
she
yielded
without
a
further
word
and
the
fact
that
such
an
emphatic
expression
of
opinion
had
been
drawn
from
the
mother
made
it
a
matter
of
course
that
no
other
member
of
the
family
took
johanna
part
so
she
buried
her
ambitions
and
kept
her
mother
house
in
an
admirable
methodical
way
it
was
not
the
sacrifice
it
seemed
however
because
johanna
adored
her
little
sister
and
would
cheerfully
have
given
up
more
than
this
for
her
sake
ephie
who
was
at
that
time
just
emerging
from
childhood
was
very
pretty
and
precocious
and
her
mother
had
great
hopes
of
her
she
also
tired
early
of
her
and
soon
after
she
turned
sixteen
declared
her
intention
of
leaving
school
as
at
least
a
couple
of
years
had
still
to
elapse
before
she
was
old
enough
to
be
introduced
in
society
cayhill
taking
the
one
decisive
step
of
her
life
determined
that
travel
in
europe
should
put
the
final
touches
to
ephie
education
a
little
german
and
french
some
finishing
lessons
on
the
violin
a
run
through
italy
and
switzerland
and
then
to
paris
whence
they
would
carry
back
with
them
a
complete
and
costly
outfit
so
valiantly
cayhill
had
her
trunks
packed
and
together
with
johanna
who
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
denying
her
age
as
of
letting
these
two
helpless
beings
go
out
into
the
world
alone
they
crossed
the
atlantic
for
some
three
months
now
they
had
been
established
in
leipzig
a
circulating
library
rich
in
english
novels
had
been
discovered
cayhill
was
content
and
it
began
to
be
plain
to
johanna
that
the
greater
part
of
their
two
years
absence
would
be
spent
in
this
place
ephie
too
had
already
had
time
to
learn
that
as
far
as
music
was
concerned
her
business
was
not
so
much
with
finishing
as
with
beginning
and
that
the
road
to
art
which
she
with
all
the
rest
must
follow
was
a
steep
one
she
might
have
found
it
still
more
arduous
had
herr
becker
her
master
not
been
a
young
man
and
very
impressionable
and
ephie
never
looked
more
charming
than
when
with
her
rounded
dimpled
arm
raised
in
an
exquisite
curve
she
leaned
her
cheek
against
the
glossy
brown
wood
of
her
violin
she
was
pretty
with
that
untouched
infantine
prettiness
before
which
old
and
young
go
helplessly
down
she
was
small
and
plump
with
a
full
white
throat
and
neck
and
soft
rounded
hands
and
wrists
that
were
dimpled
like
a
baby
her
brown
hair
was
drawn
back
from
the
low
forehead
but
both
here
and
at
the
back
of
her
neck
it
broke
into
innumerable
little
curls
which
were
much
lighter
in
colour
than
the
rest
her
skin
faintly
tinged
was
as
smooth
as
the
skin
of
a
cherry
it
had
that
exquisite
freshness
which
is
only
to
be
found
in
a
very
young
girl
and
is
lovelier
than
the
bloom
on
ripe
fruit
her
dark
blue
eyes
were
well
opened
but
the
black
lashes
were
so
long
and
so
peculiarly
straight
that
the
eyes
themselves
were
usually
hidden
and
this
made
it
all
the
more
effective
did
she
suddenly
look
up
moulded
like
wax
the
small
upturned
nose
seemed
to
draw
the
top
lip
after
it
anyhow
the
upper
lip
was
too
short
to
meet
the
lower
and
consequently
they
were
always
slightly
apart
in
a
kind
of
questioning
amaze
this
mouth
was
the
real
beauty
of
the
face
bright
red
full
yet
delicate
arched
like
a
bow
with
corners
that
went
in
and
upwards
it
belonged
by
right
of
its
absolute
innocence
to
the
face
of
a
little
child
and
the
thought
was
monstrous
that
nature
and
the
years
would
eventually
combine
to
destroy
so
perfect
a
thing
she
also
had
a
charming
laugh
with
a
liquid
note
in
it
that
made
one
think
of
water
bubbling
on
a
dry
summer
day
it
was
this
laugh
that
held
the
room
on
sunday
afternoon
and
drew
the
handful
of
young
men
together
time
after
time
cayhill
who
on
these
occasions
was
wont
to
lay
aside
her
book
was
virtually
a
deeper
echo
of
her
little
daughter
and
johanna
only
counted
in
so
far
as
she
made
and
distributed
cups
of
tea
at
the
end
of
the
room
she
did
not
look
with
favour
on
the
young
men
who
gathered
there
and
her
manner
to
them
was
curt
and
unpleasing
each
of
them
in
turn
as
he
went
up
to
her
for
his
cup
cudgelled
his
brain
for
something
to
say
but
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
converse
with
johanna
the
ordinary
small
change
and
polite
commonplace
of
conversation
she
met
with
a
silent
contempt
in
musical
she
took
no
interest
whatever
and
pretended
to
none
openly
indeed
detested
music
and
was
unable
to
distinguish
mendelssohn
from
wagner
except
by
the
noise
while
if
a
bolder
man
than
the
rest
rashly
ventured
on
the
literary
ground
that
was
her
special
demesne
she
either
smiled
at
what
he
said
in
a
disagreeably
sarcastic
way
or
flatly
contradicted
him
she
was
the
thorn
in
the
flesh
of
these
young
men
and
after
having
dutifully
spent
a
few
awkward
moments
at
her
side
they
stole
back
one
by
one
to
the
opposite
end
of
the
room
here
ephie
bewitchingly
dressed
in
blue
swung
to
and
fro
in
a
big
american
going
backwards
it
carried
her
feet
right
off
the
ground
and
talked
charming
nonsense
to
the
accompaniment
of
her
own
light
laugh
and
her
mother
deeper
notes
which
went
on
like
an
cayhill
finding
everything
ephic
said
matchlessly
amusing
as
dove
and
maurice
walked
there
together
for
the
first
time
it
now
leaked
out
that
dove
spent
every
sunday
afternoon
in
the
lessingstrasse
he
spoke
to
maurice
of
johanna
not
in
a
disparaging
way
dove
had
never
been
heard
to
mention
a
woman
name
otherwise
than
with
respect
and
in
this
case
he
deliberately
showed
up
good
qualities
in
the
hope
that
maurice
might
feel
attracted
by
her
and
remain
at
her
side
for
dove
had
fallen
deeply
in
love
with
ephie
and
had
as
it
was
more
rivals
than
he
cared
for
in
the
field
you
should
get
on
with
her
i
think
guest
he
said
slily
you
read
these
german
writers
she
is
so
interested
in
but
do
be
discouraged
by
her
manner
for
though
she
one
of
the
most
unselfish
women
i
ever
met
her
way
of
speaking
is
sometimes
abrupt
she
reminds
me
if
it
does
sound
unkind
of
a
faithful
or
something
of
the
sort
which
can
not
express
its
devotion
as
it
would
like
to
when
after
a
lively
greeting
from
ephie
and
a
few
pleasant
words
from
cayhill
maurice
found
himself
standing
beside
johanna
the
truth
of
dove
simile
was
obvious
to
him
this
dark
unattractive
girl
had
apparently
no
thought
for
anything
but
her
she
moved
the
cups
this
way
and
that
filled
the
pot
with
water
blew
out
and
lighted
again
the
flame
of
the
without
paying
the
least
heed
to
maurice
making
indeed
such
an
ostentatious
show
of
being
occupied
that
it
would
have
needed
a
brave
man
to
break
in
upon
her
duties
with
idle
words
he
remained
standing
however
in
a
constrained
silence
which
lasted
until
she
could
not
invent
anything
else
to
do
and
was
obliged
to
drink
her
own
tea
then
he
said
abruptly
in
a
tone
which
he
meant
to
be
easy
but
which
was
only
jaunty
and
how
do
you
like
being
in
germany
miss
cayhill
does
it
not
seem
very
strange
after
america
johanna
lifted
her
shortsighted
eyes
to
his
face
and
looked
coolly
and
disconcertingly
at
him
through
her
glasses
as
if
she
had
just
become
aware
of
his
presence
strange
why
should
it
she
asked
in
an
unfriendly
tone
why
what
i
mean
is
everything
must
be
so
different
here
from
what
you
are
accustomed
to
at
least
it
is
from
what
we
are
used
to
in
england
he
corrected
himself
the
ways
and
manners
and
the
language
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
excuse
me
i
do
not
know
she
answered
in
the
same
tone
as
before
if
a
person
takes
the
trouble
to
prepare
himself
for
residence
in
a
foreign
country
nothing
need
seem
either
strange
or
surprising
but
english
people
as
is
well
known
expect
to
find
a
replica
of
england
in
every
country
they
go
to
there
was
a
pause
in
which
james
the
pianist
who
was
a
regular
visitor
approached
to
have
his
cup
refilled
all
the
circle
knew
of
course
that
johanna
was
doing
for
a
new
man
and
it
seemed
to
maurice
that
james
half
closed
one
eye
at
him
and
gave
him
a
small
sympathetic
nudge
with
his
elbow
so
he
held
to
his
guns
when
james
had
retired
he
began
anew
without
preamble
my
friend
dove
tells
me
you
are
interested
in
german
literature
he
said
with
a
slight
upward
inflection
in
his
voice
johanna
did
not
reply
but
she
shot
a
quick
glance
at
him
and
colouring
perceptibly
began
to
fidget
with
the
i
done
a
little
in
that
line
myself
continued
maurice
as
she
made
no
move
to
answer
him
in
a
modest
way
of
course
just
lately
i
finished
reading
the
jungfrau
von
orleans
is
that
so
said
johanna
with
an
emphasis
which
made
him
colour
also
it
is
very
fine
is
it
not
he
asked
less
surely
and
as
she
again
acted
as
though
he
had
not
spoken
he
lost
his
presence
of
mind
i
suppose
you
know
it
you
sure
to
this
time
johanna
turned
scarlet
as
if
he
had
touched
her
on
a
sore
spot
and
answered
at
once
sharply
and
rudely
and
i
suppose
she
said
and
her
hands
shook
a
little
as
they
fussed
about
the
tray
that
you
have
also
read
maria
stuart
and
tell
and
a
page
or
two
of
jean
paul
you
have
perhaps
heard
of
lessing
and
goethe
and
you
consider
heine
the
one
and
only
german
poet
maurice
did
not
understand
what
she
meant
but
she
had
spoken
so
loudly
and
forbiddingly
that
several
eyes
were
turned
on
them
making
it
incumbent
on
him
not
to
take
offence
he
emptied
his
cup
and
put
it
down
and
tried
to
give
the
matter
an
airy
turn
and
why
not
he
asked
pleasantly
is
there
anything
wrong
in
thinking
so
schiller
and
goethe
were
great
poets
were
they
and
you
will
grant
that
heine
is
the
only
german
writer
who
has
had
anything
approaching
a
style
johanna
face
grew
stony
i
have
no
intention
of
granting
anything
she
said
like
all
english
people
it
flatters
your
national
vanity
i
presume
you
think
german
literature
began
and
ended
with
a
miserable
jew
yes
but
i
say
one
can
hardly
make
him
responsible
for
being
a
jew
can
you
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it
exclaimed
maurice
this
being
a
point
of
view
that
had
never
presented
itself
to
him
and
as
johanna
only
murmured
something
that
was
inaudible
he
added
lamely
then
you
do
think
much
of
heine
but
she
declined
to
be
drawn
into
a
discussion
even
into
an
expression
of
opinion
and
the
young
man
continued
with
apology
in
his
tone
it
may
be
bad
taste
on
my
part
of
course
but
one
hears
it
said
on
every
side
if
you
could
tell
me
what
i
ought
to
read
or
perhaps
advise
me
a
little
he
ended
tentatively
i
do
lend
my
books
said
johanna
more
rudely
than
she
had
yet
spoken
and
that
was
all
maurice
could
get
from
her
a
minute
or
two
later
she
rose
and
went
out
of
the
room
it
became
much
less
restrained
as
soon
as
the
door
had
closed
behind
her
ephie
laughed
more
roguishly
and
cayhill
allowed
herself
to
find
what
her
little
daughter
said
droller
than
before
with
an
appearance
of
unconcern
maurice
strolled
back
to
the
group
by
the
window
dove
was
also
talking
of
literature
that
reminds
me
how
did
you
like
the
book
i
lent
you
on
wednesday
mrs
cayhill
he
asked
at
the
same
instant
springing
forward
to
pick
up
ephie
handkerchief
which
had
fallen
to
the
ground
oh
very
much
indeed
very
interesting
very
good
of
you
answered
cayhill
ephie
darling
the
sun
is
shining
right
on
your
face
what
was
it
asked
james
while
dove
jumped
up
anew
to
lower
the
blind
and
ephie
raised
a
bare
dimpled
arm
to
shade
her
eyes
cayhill
could
not
recollect
the
title
just
at
once
she
had
a
wretched
memory
for
names
and
went
over
what
she
had
been
reading
let
me
see
it
was
no
that
was
yesterday
shadowed
by
three
a
most
delightful
book
on
friday
richard
elsmere
and
oh
yes
i
know
it
was
about
a
farm
an
australian
farm
the
story
of
an
african
farm
put
in
dove
mildly
returning
to
his
seat
australian
or
african
it
does
matter
which
said
cayhill
yes
a
nice
book
but
a
little
coarse
in
parts
and
very
foolish
at
the
end
the
disguising
and
the
dying
out
of
doors
and
the
and
all
that
i
must
say
i
think
it
a
very
powerful
book
said
dove
solemnly
that
part
you
know
where
the
boy
listens
to
the
clock
ticking
in
the
night
and
thinks
to
himself
that
with
every
tick
a
soul
goes
home
to
god
a
very
striking
idea
why
i
think
it
must
be
a
horrid
book
cried
ephie
all
about
dying
fancy
some
one
dying
every
minute
it
could
possibly
be
true
for
then
the
world
would
soon
be
empty
always
there
are
coming
more
into
it
said
furst
in
his
blunt
broken
english
a
pause
ensued
dove
flicked
dust
off
his
and
the
american
men
present
were
suddenly
fascinated
by
the
bottoms
of
their
cups
ephie
was
the
first
to
regain
her
composure
now
let
us
talk
of
something
pleasant
something
quite
different
from
dying
she
turned
and
over
her
shoulder
laughed
mischievously
at
maurice
who
was
siting
behind
her
then
leaning
forward
in
her
chair
with
every
eye
upon
her
she
told
how
maurice
had
saved
her
music
from
the
wind
and
with
an
arch
face
made
him
appear
very
ridiculous
by
her
prettily
exaggerated
description
of
a
heated
perspiring
young
man
darting
to
and
fro
and
muttering
to
himself
in
german
her
hearers
maurice
included
were
highly
diverted
and
no
one
more
than
cayhill
you
puss
you
puss
she
cried
wiping
her
eyes
and
shaking
a
finger
at
the
naughty
girl
the
general
amusement
had
hardly
subsided
when
furst
rose
to
his
feet
and
drawing
his
heels
together
made
a
flowery
little
speech
the
gist
of
which
was
that
he
would
have
esteemed
himself
a
most
fortunate
man
had
he
been
in
maurice
place
ephie
and
her
mother
exchanged
looks
and
shook
with
mirth
so
that
furst
who
had
spoken
seriously
and
in
good
faith
sat
down
red
and
uncomfortable
and
boehmer
who
was
dressed
in
what
he
believed
to
be
american
fashion
smiled
in
a
superior
manner
to
show
he
was
aware
that
furst
was
making
himself
ridiculous
look
here
miss
ephie
said
james
the
next
time
you
have
to
go
out
alone
just
send
for
me
and
i
take
care
of
you
or
me
said
dove
you
have
only
to
let
me
know
no
no
mr
dove
cried
cayhill
you
do
far
too
much
for
her
as
it
is
you
spoil
her
altogether
but
at
this
several
of
the
young
men
exclaimed
loudly
that
would
be
impossible
and
ephie
coloured
becomingly
raised
her
lashes
and
distributed
winning
smiles
then
quiet
had
been
restored
she
assured
them
that
they
all
very
kind
but
she
would
never
let
anyone
go
with
her
but
joan
dear
old
joan
they
could
not
imagine
how
fond
she
was
of
joan
she
is
worth
more
than
all
of
you
put
together
and
at
the
cries
of
oh
oh
she
was
thrown
into
a
new
fit
of
merriment
and
went
still
further
i
would
not
give
joan
little
finger
for
anyone
in
the
world
and
meanwhile
as
all
her
hearers
all
that
is
to
say
except
dove
who
sat
moody
fingering
his
slight
moustache
and
gazing
at
ephie
with
fondly
reproachful
eyes
as
all
of
them
with
cayhill
at
their
head
made
vehement
protest
against
this
sweeping
assertion
johanna
sat
alone
in
her
bedroom
at
the
back
of
the
house
it
was
a
dull
room
looking
on
a
courtyard
but
she
was
always
glad
to
escape
to
it
from
the
flippant
chatter
in
the
drawing
a
little
table
to
the
window
she
sat
down
and
began
to
read
but
on
this
day
her
thoughts
wandered
and
ultimately
propping
her
chin
on
her
hand
she
fell
into
reverie
which
began
with
something
like
the
fool
and
his
schiller
and
ended
with
her
rising
and
going
to
the
that
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
she
took
out
a
couple
of
volumes
and
looked
through
them
then
returned
them
to
their
places
on
the
shelf
no
she
said
to
herself
why
should
she
what
she
had
told
the
young
man
was
true
she
never
lent
her
books
he
would
soil
them
or
worse
still
not
appreciate
them
as
he
ought
she
could
not
give
anyone
who
visited
there
on
sunday
credit
for
a
nice
taste
unknown
to
herself
however
something
worked
in
her
for
the
very
next
time
maurice
was
there
she
met
him
in
the
passage
as
he
was
leaving
and
impulsively
thrust
a
paper
parcel
into
his
hand
there
is
a
book
if
you
care
to
take
it
he
did
not
express
the
surprise
he
felt
nor
did
he
look
at
the
title
but
ephie
who
was
accompanying
him
to
the
door
made
a
face
of
laughing
stupefaction
behind
her
sister
back
and
went
out
on
the
landing
with
him
to
whisper
what
have
you
been
doing
to
joan
at
which
remark
and
at
maurice
blank
face
she
laughed
so
immoderately
that
she
was
forced
to
go
down
the
stairs
with
him
for
fear
joan
should
hear
her
and
in
the
she
stood
a
little
figure
and
waved
her
hand
to
him
until
he
turned
the
corner
having
read
the
first
volume
of
hammer
und
amboss
deep
into
two
nights
maurice
returned
it
and
carried
away
the
second
but
it
was
only
after
he
had
finished
problematische
naturen
and
had
expressed
himself
with
due
enthusiasm
that
johanna
began
to
thaw
a
little
she
did
not
discuss
what
he
read
with
him
but
going
on
the
assumption
that
a
person
who
could
relish
her
favourite
author
had
some
good
in
him
she
gave
the
young
man
the
following
proof
of
her
favour
between
ephie
and
him
there
had
sprung
up
spontaneously
a
mutual
liking
which
it
is
hard
to
tell
the
cause
of
for
ephie
knew
nothing
of
maurice
tastes
interests
and
ambitions
and
he
did
not
dream
of
asking
her
to
share
them
yet
with
the
safe
instincts
of
a
young
girl
she
chose
him
for
a
brother
from
among
all
her
other
acquaintances
called
him
morry
scarcely
ever
coquetted
with
him
and
let
him
freely
into
her
secrets
it
is
easier
to
see
why
maurice
was
attracted
to
her
for
not
only
was
ephie
pretty
and
charming
she
was
also
adorably
equable
she
did
not
know
what
it
was
to
be
out
of
humour
and
she
was
always
glad
to
see
him
always
in
the
best
possible
spirits
when
he
was
dull
or
tired
it
acted
like
a
tonic
on
him
to
sit
and
let
her
merry
chatter
run
over
him
and
soon
he
found
plenty
of
makeshifts
to
see
her
amongst
other
things
he
arranged
to
help
her
twice
a
week
with
harmony
which
was
to
her
an
unexplorable
abyss
and
he
ransacked
the
rooms
and
shelves
of
his
acquaintances
to
find
old
tauchnitz
volumes
to
lend
to
cayhill
the
latter
paid
even
less
attention
to
the
sudden
friendship
of
her
daughter
with
this
young
man
than
the
ordinary
american
mother
would
have
done
but
johanna
toleration
of
it
was
for
the
most
part
to
be
explained
by
the
literary
interests
before
mentioned
for
johanna
was
always
in
a
tremble
lest
ephie
should
become
spoiled
and
thoughtless
ephie
could
at
times
cause
her
a
most
subtle
torture
by
being
prettily
insincere
by
assuming
false
coquettish
airs
or
by
seeming
to
have
private
thoughts
which
she
did
not
confide
to
her
sister
this
and
the
knowledge
that
ephie
was
now
of
an
age
when
every
day
might
be
expected
to
widen
the
distance
between
them
sometimes
made
johanna
very
gruff
and
short
even
with
ephie
herself
as
her
sister
she
alone
knew
how
much
was
good
and
true
under
the
child
light
exterior
she
admired
in
ephie
all
that
she
herself
had
not
her
fair
prettiness
her
blithe
manner
her
easy
graceful
words
and
had
it
been
necessary
she
would
have
gone
down
on
her
knees
to
remove
the
stones
from
path
thus
although
on
the
casual
observer
johanna
only
made
the
impression
of
a
dark
morose
figure
which
hovered
round
two
childlike
beings
intercepting
the
sunshine
of
their
lives
yet
maurice
had
soon
come
often
enough
into
contact
with
her
to
appreciate
her
unselfishness
and
for
the
care
she
took
of
ephie
he
could
almost
have
liked
her
had
johanna
shown
the
least
readiness
to
be
liked
naturally
he
did
not
understand
how
highly
he
was
favoured
by
her
he
knew
neither
the
depth
of
her
affection
for
ephie
nor
the
exact
degree
of
contempt
in
which
she
held
the
young
men
who
dangled
there
on
a
sunday
poor
fools
who
were
growing
fat
on
emotion
and
silly
ideas
when
they
should
have
been
taking
plain
hard
fare
at
college
to
dove
johanna
had
a
particular
aversion
chiefly
and
in
a
contradictory
spirit
because
it
was
evident
to
all
that
his
intentions
were
serious
but
she
could
not
hinder
wayward
ephie
from
making
a
shameless
use
of
him
and
then
laughing
at
him
behind
his
back
a
laugh
in
which
cayhill
was
not
always
able
to
refrain
from
joining
though
it
must
be
said
that
she
was
usually
loud
in
her
praises
of
dove
at
the
expense
of
all
visitors
who
were
not
american
from
these
dutch
you
ca
expect
much
one
way
or
the
other
she
declared
and
young
guest
sometimes
sits
there
with
a
face
as
long
as
my
arm
but
dove
is
really
a
most
sensible
young
fellow
why
he
thinks
just
as
i
do
about
arnerica
and
as
a
special
mark
of
favour
when
dove
left
the
house
on
sunday
afternoon
his
pockets
bulged
with
new
york
heralds
vii
meanwhile
before
the
blinds
in
the
bruderstrasse
were
drawn
up
again
maurice
had
found
his
way
back
to
madeleine
when
they
met
she
smiled
at
him
in
a
somewhat
sarcastic
manner
but
no
reference
was
made
to
the
little
they
had
had
and
they
began
afresh
to
read
and
play
together
on
the
first
afternoon
maurice
was
full
of
his
new
friends
and
described
them
at
length
to
her
but
madeleine
damped
his
ardour
i
know
them
yes
of
course
she
said
the
usual
americans
even
the
from
whom
heaven
defend
us
the
little
one
is
pretty
enough
as
long
as
she
keeps
her
mouth
shut
but
the
moment
she
speaks
every
illusion
is
why
i
do
go
there
on
a
sunday
good
gracious
do
you
think
they
want
me
me
or
any
other
petticoat
are
honours
made
to
be
divided
no
maurice
i
do
like
americans
i
was
once
offered
a
position
in
america
as
of
piano
and
in
a
place
called
schenectady
but
i
did
hesitate
i
said
to
myself
better
one
hundred
a
year
in
good
old
england
than
five
in
a
country
where
the
population
is
so
inflated
with
its
importance
that
i
should
always
be
in
danger
of
running
amuck
and
besides
that
i
should
lose
my
accent
and
forget
how
to
say
while
the
workings
of
the
stomach
would
be
discussed
before
me
with
an
unpleasant
freedom
you
too
hard
on
them
madeleine
said
maurice
smiling
in
spite
of
himself
but
he
was
beginning
to
stand
in
awe
of
her
sharp
tongue
and
decided
opinions
and
in
the
week
that
followed
he
took
himself
resolutely
together
and
did
not
let
a
certain
name
cross
his
lips
consequently
he
was
more
than
surprised
on
returning
to
his
room
one
day
to
find
a
note
from
madeleine
saying
that
she
expected
louise
that
very
afternoon
at
three
it
was
not
news
to
maurice
that
louise
had
come
home
the
evening
before
as
he
turned
out
of
the
bruderstrasse
a
closed
droschke
turned
into
it
after
the
vehicle
had
lumbered
past
him
and
disappeared
the
thought
crossed
his
mind
that
she
might
be
inside
it
he
had
not
then
had
time
to
go
back
but
early
this
very
morning
he
had
passed
the
house
and
found
the
windows
open
so
madeleine
had
engaged
her
immediately
as
usual
furst
had
kept
him
waiting
for
his
lesson
it
was
nearly
three
already
and
he
was
so
hurried
that
he
could
only
change
his
collar
but
on
the
way
there
in
a
sudden
spurt
of
gratitude
he
ran
to
a
and
bought
a
large
bunch
of
carnations
he
arrived
at
madeleine
room
in
an
elation
he
did
not
try
to
hide
and
over
the
carnations
they
had
a
mock
reconciliation
madeleine
wished
to
distribute
the
flowers
in
different
vases
about
the
room
but
he
asked
her
put
them
all
together
on
the
centre
table
she
laughed
and
complied
for
several
weeks
now
musical
circles
had
been
in
a
stir
over
the
advent
of
a
new
named
schrievers
a
person
who
called
himself
a
pupil
of
liszt
held
progressive
views
arid
being
a
free
lance
openly
ridiculed
the
antiquated
methods
of
the
conservatorium
madeleine
was
extremely
interested
in
the
case
and
as
they
sat
waiting
talked
about
it
to
maurice
with
great
warmth
enlarging
especially
upon
the
number
of
people
who
had
the
audacity
to
call
themselves
pupils
of
liszt
to
maurice
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
the
matter
seemed
of
no
possible
consequence
for
all
he
cared
the
whole
population
of
the
town
might
lay
claim
to
having
been
at
weimar
and
he
could
not
understand
madeleine
finding
it
important
for
he
was
in
one
of
those
moods
when
the
entire
consciousness
is
so
intently
directed
towards
some
end
that
outside
this
end
nothing
has
colour
or
vitality
all
that
has
previously
impressed
and
interested
one
has
no
more
solidity
than
papier
mache
meanwhile
she
spoke
on
and
did
not
appear
to
notice
how
time
was
flying
he
was
forced
at
length
to
take
out
his
watch
and
exclaim
in
feigned
surprise
at
the
hour
a
quarter
to
four
already
is
it
so
late
but
on
seeing
his
disturbance
she
added
it
will
be
all
right
louise
was
never
punctual
in
her
life
he
did
his
best
to
look
unconcerned
and
they
spoke
of
that
abendunterhaltung
at
which
furst
was
to
play
but
by
the
time
the
clock
struck
four
maurice
had
relapsed
in
spite
of
himself
into
silence
madeleine
rallied
him
you
must
make
shift
with
my
company
maurice
not
but
what
i
am
sure
louise
will
come
but
you
see
from
this
what
she
is
the
most
unreliable
creature
in
the
world
to
pass
the
time
she
suggested
that
he
should
help
her
to
make
tea
and
they
were
both
busy
when
the
electric
bell
in
the
passage
whizzed
harshly
and
the
next
moment
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
but
it
was
not
louise
instead
two
persons
entered
one
of
whom
was
heinrich
krafft
the
other
a
short
thickset
girl
in
a
man
felt
hat
and
a
closely
buttoned
ulster
on
recognising
her
visitors
madeleine
made
a
movement
of
annoyance
and
drew
her
brows
together
you
heinz
she
said
undaunted
by
this
greeting
krafft
advanced
to
her
and
taking
her
hands
kissed
them
one
after
the
other
he
was
also
about
to
kiss
her
on
the
lips
but
she
defended
herself
stop
we
are
not
alone
just
for
that
reason
said
the
girl
in
the
ulster
drily
what
ill
wind
blows
you
here
madeleine
asked
him
as
he
was
still
wearing
his
hat
she
took
it
off
and
dropped
it
on
the
floor
beside
him
then
she
recollected
maurice
and
made
him
known
to
the
other
two
coming
forward
maurice
recalled
to
krafft
memory
where
they
had
already
met
and
what
had
passed
between
them
before
he
had
finished
speaking
krafft
burst
into
an
unmannerly
peal
of
laughter
madeleine
laughed
too
and
shook
her
finger
at
him
you
have
been
up
to
your
tricks
again
avery
hill
the
girl
in
the
ulster
did
not
laugh
aloud
but
a
smile
played
round
her
mouth
which
maurice
found
even
more
disagreeable
than
the
mirth
of
which
he
had
been
the
innocent
cause
he
coloured
and
withdrew
to
the
window
krafft
was
so
convulsed
that
he
was
obliged
to
sit
down
on
the
sofa
where
madeleine
fanned
him
with
a
sheet
of
music
he
had
been
seized
by
a
kind
of
paroxysm
and
laughed
on
and
on
in
a
mirthless
way
till
avery
hill
said
suddenly
and
angrily
stop
laughing
at
once
heinz
you
will
have
hysterics
in
an
instant
he
was
sobered
and
now
he
seemed
to
fall
without
transition
into
a
mood
of
dejection
taking
out
his
penknife
he
set
to
paring
his
nails
in
a
precise
and
preoccupied
manner
madeleine
turned
to
maurice
you
wonder
what
all
this
is
about
she
said
apologetically
but
heinz
is
never
happier
than
when
he
has
succeeded
in
imposing
on
some
one
as
he
evidently
did
on
you
indeed
said
maurice
their
laughter
had
been
offensive
to
him
and
he
found
krafft
and
madeleine
with
him
exceedingly
foolish
there
was
a
brief
silence
krafft
was
absorbed
in
what
he
was
doing
and
avery
hill
on
sitting
down
had
lighted
a
cigarette
which
she
smoked
steadily
in
whiffs
she
was
a
pretty
girl
in
spite
of
her
severe
garb
in
spite
too
of
her
expression
which
was
too
composed
and
too
to
be
altogether
pleasing
her
face
was
fresh
of
skin
below
smooth
fair
hair
and
her
lips
were
the
red
ripe
lips
of
botticelli
angels
and
madonnas
but
the
under
one
being
fuller
than
the
other
gave
the
mouth
a
look
of
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
anything
less
girlish
than
were
the
cold
grey
eyes
we
came
for
the
book
you
promised
to
lend
heinz
she
said
blowing
off
the
spike
of
ash
that
had
accumulated
at
the
tip
of
the
cigarette
he
could
not
rest
till
he
had
it
madeleine
placed
a
saucer
on
the
table
with
the
request
to
use
it
as
an
and
taking
down
a
volume
of
de
quincey
from
the
hanging
shelf
held
it
out
to
krafft
there
you
are
it
will
interest
me
to
hear
what
you
make
of
it
krafft
ceased
his
paring
to
glance
at
the
i
shall
probably
not
open
it
he
said
madeleine
laughed
and
gave
him
a
light
blow
on
the
hand
with
the
book
how
like
you
that
is
as
soon
as
you
know
that
you
can
get
a
thing
you
do
want
it
any
longer
yes
that
heinz
all
over
said
avery
hill
only
what
he
got
seems
worth
having
krafft
shut
his
knife
with
a
click
and
put
it
back
in
his
pocket
and
that
what
you
women
ca
understand
is
it
that
the
best
of
things
is
the
wishing
for
them
once
there
and
they
are
nothing
only
another
delusion
the
happiest
man
is
the
man
whose
wishes
are
never
fulfilled
he
always
has
a
moon
to
cry
for
come
come
now
said
madeleine
we
know
your
love
for
paradox
but
not
there
no
time
for
philosophising
today
besides
you
are
in
a
pessimistic
mood
and
that
a
bad
sign
i
and
pessimism
listen
heart
of
my
heart
i
have
a
new
story
for
you
he
moved
closer
to
her
and
put
his
arm
round
her
neck
there
was
once
a
man
and
his
wife
but
at
the
first
word
madeleine
put
her
hands
to
her
ears
mercy
have
mercy
heinz
no
stories
i
entreat
you
and
behave
yourself
too
take
your
arm
away
she
tried
to
remove
it
i
have
told
you
already
i
ca
have
you
here
i
expecting
a
visitor
he
laid
his
head
on
her
shoulder
let
him
come
let
the
whole
world
come
i
do
budge
i
am
happy
here
you
must
go
and
be
happy
elsewhere
said
madeleine
more
decisively
than
she
had
yet
spoken
and
before
she
comes
too
she
what
she
never
mind
for
that
very
reason
mada
she
whispered
a
word
in
his
ear
he
looked
at
her
incredulously
at
first
then
whimsically
with
a
sham
dismay
and
then
as
if
maurice
had
only
just
taken
shape
for
him
he
turned
and
looked
at
him
also
and
from
him
to
madeleine
and
back
to
him
finally
bursting
afresh
into
a
roar
of
laughter
madeleine
laid
her
hand
over
his
mouth
take
him
away
do
she
said
to
avery
hill
as
a
favour
to
me
yes
when
i
have
finished
my
cigarette
said
the
girl
without
stirring
unsettled
all
the
same
it
would
seem
by
what
he
had
heard
krafft
rose
and
shuffled
about
the
room
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
approaching
maurice
he
even
stood
for
a
moment
and
contemplated
him
with
a
kind
of
mock
gravity
maurice
acted
as
if
he
did
not
see
krafft
long
since
he
had
taken
up
a
magazine
and
half
hidden
in
a
chair
between
window
and
pretended
to
bury
himself
in
its
contents
but
he
heard
very
plainly
all
that
passed
and
at
the
effect
produced
on
krafft
by
the
name
of
the
expected
visitor
his
hands
trembled
with
anger
if
the
fellow
had
stood
looking
at
him
for
another
second
he
would
have
got
up
and
knocked
him
down
but
krafft
turned
nonchalantly
to
the
piano
where
his
attention
was
caught
by
a
song
that
was
standing
on
the
rack
he
chuckled
and
set
about
making
merciless
fun
of
the
music
the
composer
was
an
elderly
of
local
fame
madeleine
grew
angry
and
tried
to
take
it
from
him
hold
your
tongue
heinz
if
your
own
songs
were
more
like
this
they
would
have
a
better
chance
of
success
now
be
quiet
i
wo
hear
another
word
herr
wendling
is
a
very
good
friend
of
mine
a
friend
heavens
she
says
friend
as
if
it
were
an
excuse
for
mada
let
your
friend
cease
making
music
if
he
hopes
for
salvation
let
him
buy
a
broom
and
sweep
the
streets
let
him
you
are
disgusting
she
had
got
the
music
from
him
but
he
was
already
at
the
piano
parodying
from
memory
the
conventional
accompaniment
and
sentimental
words
of
the
song
and
this
he
said
from
the
learned
ass
who
is
not
yet
convinced
that
the
feuerzauber
is
music
and
who
groans
like
a
dredge
when
the
last
act
of
siegfried
is
mentioned
wendling
and
wagner
listen
to
this
for
once
i
am
a
wagnerite
he
felt
after
the
chords
that
prelude
brunnhilde
awakening
by
siegfried
until
now
avery
hill
had
sat
indifferent
as
though
what
went
on
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
but
no
sooner
had
krafft
commenced
to
play
than
she
grew
uneasy
her
eyes
lost
their
cold
assurance
and
suddenly
getting
up
and
going
round
to
the
front
of
the
piano
she
pushed
the
young
man
hands
from
the
keys
krafft
yielded
his
place
to
her
and
taking
up
the
chords
where
he
had
left
them
she
went
on
she
played
very
well
even
maurice
in
his
disturbance
could
not
but
notice
it
with
a
firm
masculine
touch
and
that
inborn
ease
that
enviable
appearance
of
perfect
fitness
of
being
one
with
the
instrument
which
even
the
greatest
players
do
not
always
attain
she
had
besides
grip
and
rhythm
and
long
hands
insinuated
themselves
artfully
among
the
complicated
harmonies
when
she
began
to
play
madeleine
made
tch
tch
tch
and
shook
her
head
in
despair
of
now
ever
being
rid
of
them
krafft
remained
standing
behind
the
piano
at
the
window
leaning
his
forehead
on
the
glass
maurice
who
watched
them
both
surreptitiously
saw
his
face
change
and
grow
thoughtful
as
he
stood
there
but
when
avery
hill
ceased
abruptly
on
a
discord
he
wheeled
round
at
once
and
patted
her
on
the
back
while
looking
over
to
maurice
he
said
no
doubt
you
found
that
very
pretty
and
affecting
i
think
that
none
of
your
business
said
maurice
but
krafft
did
not
take
umbrage
you
do
say
so
he
murmured
with
a
show
of
surprise
now
go
go
go
cried
madeleine
what
have
i
done
to
be
subjected
to
such
a
visitation
no
heinz
you
do
sit
down
again
here
your
hat
away
with
you
or
i
have
you
put
out
by
force
and
at
last
they
really
did
go
to
a
cool
bow
from
maurice
who
still
sat
holding
his
magazine
but
madeleine
had
hardly
closed
the
door
behind
them
when
like
a
whirlwind
krafft
burst
into
the
room
again
mada
i
forgot
to
ask
you
something
he
said
in
a
drawing
her
aside
tell
me
you
kupplerin
you
does
he
know
her
he
pointed
over
his
shoulder
with
his
thumb
at
maurice
madeleine
shook
her
head
in
real
vexation
and
distress
and
laid
a
finger
on
her
lip
but
it
was
of
no
use
stepping
over
to
maurice
krafft
bowed
low
and
held
his
hat
against
his
breast
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
understand
how
deeply
it
has
interested
me
to
meet
you
he
said
allow
me
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
to
wish
you
success
whereupon
before
maurice
could
say
damn
he
was
gone
again
leaving
his
elfin
laugh
behind
him
in
the
air
like
smoke
madeleine
shut
the
door
energetically
and
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
thank
goodness
i
thought
they
would
never
go
and
now
the
chances
are
they
run
into
louise
on
the
stairs
you
wonder
why
i
was
so
bent
on
getting
rid
of
them
it
a
long
story
i
tell
it
to
you
some
other
time
but
if
louise
had
found
them
here
when
she
came
she
would
not
have
stayed
she
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
heinz
i
do
wonder
at
it
said
maurice
he
stood
up
and
threw
the
magazine
on
the
table
madeleine
displayed
more
astonishment
than
she
felt
why
what
the
matter
you
surely
not
going
to
take
what
heinz
said
seriously
he
was
in
a
bad
mood
i
know
and
i
noticed
you
were
very
short
with
him
but
you
must
be
foolish
enough
to
be
offended
by
him
no
one
ever
is
he
is
allowed
to
say
and
do
just
what
he
likes
he
our
spoilt
child
maurice
laughed
the
fellow
is
either
a
cad
or
an
unutterable
fool
you
madeleine
may
find
his
impertinence
amusing
i
tell
you
candidly
i
do
and
he
went
on
to
make
it
clear
to
her
that
the
fault
would
not
be
his
were
krafft
and
he
ever
in
the
same
room
together
again
the
kind
of
man
one
wants
to
kick
downstairs
what
the
deuce
did
he
mean
by
guffawing
like
that
when
you
told
him
who
was
coming
you
mean
about
louise
madeleine
gave
a
slight
shrug
yes
maurice
unfortunately
that
was
not
to
be
avoided
but
sit
down
again
and
let
me
explain
things
to
you
when
you
hear
but
he
did
not
want
explanations
he
did
not
even
want
an
answer
to
the
question
he
had
put
his
chief
concern
now
was
to
get
away
to
stay
there
in
that
room
for
another
quarter
of
an
hour
would
be
impossible
on
such
tenterhooks
was
he
to
stay
for
what
only
to
listen
to
more
slanderous
hints
of
the
kind
he
had
heard
before
as
it
was
he
did
not
believe
he
could
face
her
frankly
should
she
still
come
he
felt
as
if
in
some
occult
way
he
had
assisted
at
a
tampering
with
her
good
name
you
will
surely
not
be
so
childish
said
madeleine
on
seeing
him
take
up
his
hat
childish
you
call
it
childish
he
exclaimed
growing
angry
with
her
too
do
you
know
what
time
it
is
three
you
write
me
and
it
now
a
quarter
past
five
i
have
sat
here
doing
nothing
for
over
two
mortal
hours
it
seems
to
me
that
enough
without
being
made
the
butt
of
your
friends
wit
into
the
bargain
i
sick
of
the
whole
thing
we
seem
bound
to
quarrel
said
madeleine
calmly
and
always
about
louise
but
there
no
use
in
being
angry
i
am
not
responsible
for
what
heinz
says
and
does
and
on
the
mere
chance
of
his
coming
in
to
sit
down
and
unroll
another
savoury
story
to
you
about
your
idol
would
you
have
thanked
me
for
it
remember
the
time
i
did
try
to
open
you
eyes
it
not
fair
either
to
blame
me
because
louise
come
i
did
my
best
for
you
i
ca
help
it
if
she
as
stable
as
water
i
think
you
dislike
her
too
much
to
want
to
help
it
said
maurice
grimly
he
stood
staring
at
the
carnations
and
his
resentment
gave
way
to
depression
as
he
recalled
the
mood
which
he
had
bought
them
come
back
as
soon
as
you
feel
better
i
not
offended
remember
madeleine
called
after
him
as
he
went
down
the
stairs
when
she
was
alone
she
said
silly
boy
and
still
smiling
made
excuses
for
him
he
had
come
with
such
pleasurable
anticipations
and
everything
had
gone
wrong
heinz
had
behaved
disagracefully
as
only
he
could
while
as
for
louise
one
was
no
more
able
to
rely
on
her
than
on
a
wisp
straw
and
she
madeleine
was
little
better
than
a
fool
not
to
have
known
it
she
moved
about
the
room
putting
chairs
and
papers
in
their
places
for
she
could
not
endure
disorder
of
any
kind
then
she
sat
down
to
write
a
letter
and
when
some
half
hour
later
the
girl
for
whom
they
had
waited
actually
came
she
met
her
with
exclamations
of
genuine
surprise
is
it
really
you
i
had
given
you
up
long
ago
pray
do
you
know
what
time
it
is
she
took
out
her
watch
and
dangled
it
before
the
other
eyes
but
louise
dufrayer
hardly
glanced
at
it
as
however
madeleine
persisted
she
said
i
late
i
know
but
it
was
not
my
fault
i
could
get
away
she
unpinned
her
hat
and
shook
back
her
hair
and
madeleine
helped
her
to
take
off
her
jacket
talking
all
the
time
i
have
been
much
annoyed
with
you
does
it
never
occur
to
you
that
you
may
put
other
people
in
awkward
positions
by
not
keeping
your
word
but
you
are
just
the
same
as
of
old
incorrigible
then
why
try
to
improve
me
said
the
other
with
a
show
of
lightness
but
almost
simultaneously
she
turned
away
from
tone
passed
her
handkerchief
over
her
lips
and
after
making
a
vain
attempt
to
control
herself
burst
into
tears
madeleine
eyed
her
shrewdly
what
the
matter
with
you
but
the
girl
who
had
sunk
into
a
corner
of
the
sofa
merely
shook
her
head
and
sobbed
and
madeleine
to
whom
such
emotional
outbreaks
were
distasteful
went
to
the
and
busied
herself
there
with
her
back
to
the
room
she
did
not
ask
for
an
explanation
nor
did
her
companion
offer
any
louise
abandoned
herself
to
her
tears
with
as
little
restraint
as
though
she
were
alone
holding
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
with
both
hands
and
giving
deep
spasmodic
sobs
which
had
apparently
been
held
for
some
time
in
cheek
afterwards
she
sat
with
her
elbow
on
the
end
of
the
sofa
her
face
on
her
hand
and
still
shaken
at
intervals
by
a
convulsive
breath
watched
madeleine
make
fresh
tea
but
when
she
took
the
cup
that
was
handed
to
her
she
was
so
far
herself
again
as
to
inquire
whom
she
was
to
have
met
although
her
voice
still
did
not
obey
her
properly
some
one
who
is
anxious
to
know
you
replied
madeleine
an
air
of
mystery
but
he
could
or
rather
would
not
wait
so
long
louise
showed
no
further
curiosity
but
when
madeleine
said
with
meaning
emphasis
that
krafft
had
also
been
there
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
she
shrank
perceptibly
and
flushed
what
does
he
still
exist
she
asked
with
an
effort
at
playfulness
as
you
very
well
know
answered
madeleine
drily
tell
me
louise
how
do
you
manage
to
keep
out
of
his
way
louise
made
no
rejoinder
she
raised
her
cup
to
her
lips
and
the
dark
blood
that
had
stained
her
face
in
a
manner
distressing
to
see
slowly
retreated
she
continued
to
look
down
and
the
light
of
her
big
dark
eyes
gone
out
her
face
seemed
wan
and
dead
madeleine
studying
her
asked
herself
not
for
the
first
time
but
as
always
with
an
unclear
irritation
what
the
secret
of
the
other
charm
was
beautiful
she
had
never
thought
louise
she
was
not
even
pretty
in
an
honest
way
at
best
a
strange
creature
black
of
eyes
and
hair
with
flashing
teeth
and
a
wonderfully
mobile
mouth
and
some
people
hopeless
devotees
of
a
pink
and
white
fairness
had
been
known
to
call
her
plain
at
this
moment
she
was
looking
her
worst
the
heavy
lines
beneath
her
eyes
were
deepened
by
crying
her
rough
hair
had
been
hastily
coiled
unbrushed
and
she
was
wearing
a
shabby
red
blouse
that
was
pinned
across
in
front
where
a
button
was
missing
there
was
nothing
young
or
fresh
about
her
she
looked
her
years
every
day
of
them
and
more
and
yet
madeleine
knew
that
those
who
admired
louise
would
find
her
as
desirable
at
this
moment
as
at
any
other
hers
was
a
nameless
charm
it
was
present
in
each
gesture
of
the
slim
hands
in
each
turn
of
the
head
in
every
movement
of
the
broad
slender
body
strangers
felt
it
instantly
her
very
walk
seemed
provocative
of
notice
there
was
something
in
the
way
her
skirts
clung
and
moved
with
her
that
was
different
from
the
motion
of
other
women
and
those
whose
type
she
embodied
went
crazy
about
her
madeleine
remembered
as
though
it
were
yesterday
the
afternoon
on
which
heinz
had
burst
in
to
rave
to
her
of
his
discovery
and
how
he
would
have
dragged
her
out
hatless
to
see
this
miracle
she
remembered
too
after
days
when
she
had
had
him
there
pacing
the
floor
and
pouring
out
his
feelings
to
her
infatuated
mad
an
he
was
not
the
only
one
they
bowled
over
like
ninepins
an
it
would
be
the
same
for
years
to
come
was
there
any
reason
to
wonder
at
maurice
guest
meanwhile
as
madeleine
sat
thinking
these
and
similar
things
maurice
was
tramping
through
the
rosental
the
may
afternoon
of
lucent
sunshine
and
heaped
fleecy
clouds
had
tempted
a
host
of
people
into
the
great
park
but
he
soon
left
them
all
behind
him
for
he
walked
as
though
he
were
pursued
these
people
placid
and
content
of
face
and
the
brightness
of
the
day
jarred
on
him
he
was
out
of
patience
with
himself
with
madeleine
with
the
world
at
large
especially
with
madeleine
he
bore
her
a
grudge
for
her
hints
and
innuendoes
for
being
behind
the
scenes
as
it
were
and
also
for
being
so
ready
to
enlighten
him
but
most
of
all
for
a
certain
malicious
gratification
which
was
to
be
felt
in
ever
word
she
said
about
louise
he
went
steadily
on
against
the
level
bars
of
the
afternoon
sun
and
by
the
time
he
had
tired
himself
bodily
he
had
worked
off
his
inward
vexation
as
well
as
he
walked
back
towards
the
town
he
was
almost
ready
to
smile
at
his
previous
heat
what
did
all
these
others
matter
to
him
they
could
not
hinder
him
from
carrying
through
what
he
had
set
his
mind
on
was
a
day
and
the
next
was
another
and
the
next
again
and
life
considered
thus
in
days
and
opportunities
was
infinitely
long
he
now
felt
not
only
an
aversion
to
dwelling
on
his
thoughts
of
an
hour
back
but
also
the
need
of
forgetting
them
altogether
and
in
nearing
the
lessingstrasse
he
followed
an
impulse
to
go
to
ephie
and
to
let
her
merry
laugh
wipe
out
the
last
traces
of
his
cayhill
and
johanna
were
both
reading
in
the
sitting
room
and
though
johanna
agreeably
laid
aside
her
book
conversation
languished
ephie
was
sent
for
but
did
not
come
and
maurice
was
beginning
to
wish
he
had
thought
twice
before
calling
when
her
voice
was
heard
in
the
passage
and
a
moment
later
she
burst
into
the
room
with
her
arms
full
of
lilac
branches
of
lilac
which
she
explained
had
been
bought
early
that
morning
at
the
by
one
of
their
she
hardly
greeted
maurice
but
going
over
to
him
held
up
her
scented
burden
and
was
not
content
till
he
had
buried
his
face
in
it
is
it
just
sweet
she
cried
holding
it
high
for
all
to
see
and
the
very
first
that
is
to
be
had
again
maurice
again
put
your
face
right
down
into
the
middle
of
it
like
that
cayhill
laughed
as
maurice
obediently
bowed
his
head
but
johanna
reproved
her
sister
do
be
silly
ephie
you
behave
as
if
you
had
never
seen
lilac
before
well
neither
i
have
not
such
lilac
as
this
and
maurice
either
answered
ephie
you
shall
smell
it
too
old
joan
and
in
spite
of
johanna
protests
she
forced
her
sister
also
to
sink
her
face
in
the
fragrant
white
and
purple
blossoms
but
then
she
left
them
lying
on
the
table
and
it
was
johanna
who
put
them
in
water
cayhill
withdrew
to
her
bedroom
to
be
undisturbed
and
johanna
went
out
on
an
errand
maurice
and
ephie
sat
side
by
side
on
the
sofa
and
he
helped
her
to
distinguish
chords
of
the
seventh
and
watched
her
make
in
her
the
big
tailless
notes
at
which
she
herself
was
always
hugely
tickled
her
so
of
eggs
but
on
this
particular
evening
she
was
not
in
a
studious
mood
and
bock
pencil
and
slid
to
the
floor
both
windows
were
wide
open
the
air
that
entered
was
full
of
pleasant
scents
while
that
of
the
room
was
heavy
with
lilac
ephie
had
taken
a
spray
from
one
of
the
vases
and
was
playing
with
it
and
when
maurice
chid
her
for
thoughtlessly
destroying
it
she
stuck
the
pieces
in
her
hair
not
content
with
this
she
also
put
bits
behind
maurice
ears
and
tried
to
twist
one
in
the
piece
of
hair
that
fell
on
his
forehead
having
thus
bedizened
them
she
leaned
back
and
with
her
hands
clasped
behind
her
head
began
to
tease
the
young
man
a
little
bird
it
seemed
had
whispered
her
any
number
of
interesting
things
about
madeleine
and
maurice
and
she
had
stored
them
all
up
now
she
repeated
them
with
a
charming
impertinence
and
was
so
provoking
that
in
laughing
exasperation
maurice
took
her
fluffy
head
between
his
hands
and
stopped
her
lips
with
two
sound
kisses
he
acted
impulsively
without
reflecting
but
as
soon
as
it
was
done
he
felt
a
curious
sense
of
satisfaction
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
ephie
and
was
like
a
kind
of
unconscious
revenge
taken
on
some
one
else
he
was
not
however
prepared
for
the
effect
of
his
hasty
deed
ephie
turned
scarlet
and
jumping
up
from
the
sofa
so
that
all
the
blossoms
fell
from
her
hair
at
once
stamped
her
foot
maurice
guest
how
dare
you
she
cried
angrily
and
to
his
surprise
the
young
man
saw
that
she
had
tears
in
her
eyes
he
had
never
known
ephie
to
be
even
annoyed
and
was
consequently
dumfounded
he
could
not
believe
after
the
direct
provocation
she
had
given
him
that
his
crime
had
been
so
great
but
ephie
dear
he
protested
i
had
no
idea
upon
my
word
i
had
that
you
would
take
it
like
this
what
the
matter
it
was
nothing
do
cry
i
a
brute
yes
you
are
a
horrid
brute
i
shall
never
forgive
you
never
said
ephie
and
then
she
began
to
cry
in
earnest
he
put
his
arm
round
her
and
coaxing
her
to
sit
down
wiped
away
her
tears
with
his
own
handkerchief
in
vain
did
he
beg
her
to
tell
him
why
she
was
so
vexed
to
all
he
said
she
only
shook
her
head
and
answered
you
had
no
right
to
do
it
he
vowed
solemnly
that
it
should
never
happen
again
but
at
least
a
quarter
of
an
hour
elapsed
before
he
succeeded
in
comforting
her
and
even
then
she
remained
more
subdued
than
usual
but
when
maurice
had
gone
and
she
had
dropped
the
scattered
sprays
of
lilac
out
of
the
window
on
his
head
she
clasped
her
hands
at
the
back
of
her
neck
and
dropped
a
curtsy
to
herself
in
the
him
too
she
said
aloud
she
nodded
at
her
reflected
self
but
her
face
was
grave
for
between
these
two
small
figures
was
a
deep
and
unsuspected
secret
and
maurice
as
he
walked
away
wondered
to
himself
for
still
a
little
why
she
should
have
been
so
disproportionately
angry
but
not
for
long
for
when
he
was
not
actually
with
ephie
he
was
not
given
to
thinking
much
about
her
besides
from
there
he
went
straight
to
the
latter
half
of
an
abendanterkaltung
to
hear
furst
play
brahms
variations
on
a
theme
by
handel
viii
that
night
he
had
a
vivid
dream
he
dreamt
that
he
was
in
a
garden
where
nothing
but
lilac
grew
grew
with
a
luxuriance
he
could
not
have
believed
possible
and
on
fantastic
bushes
there
were
bushes
like
steeples
and
bushes
smaller
than
himself
big
and
little
broad
and
slender
but
all
were
of
lilac
and
in
flower
an
extravagant
profusion
of
white
and
purple
blossoms
he
gazed
round
him
in
delight
and
took
an
eager
step
forward
but
before
he
could
reach
the
nearest
bush
he
saw
that
it
had
been
an
illusion
the
bush
was
stripped
and
bare
and
the
rest
were
bare
as
well
you
too
late
it
has
all
been
gathered
he
heard
a
voice
say
and
at
this
moment
he
saw
ephie
at
the
end
of
a
long
alley
of
bushes
coming
towards
him
her
arms
full
of
lilac
she
smiled
and
nodded
to
him
over
it
and
he
heard
her
laugh
but
when
she
was
down
the
path
he
discovered
his
mistake
it
was
not
ephie
but
louise
she
came
slowly
forward
her
laden
arms
outstretched
and
he
would
have
given
his
life
to
be
able
to
advance
and
to
take
what
she
offered
him
but
he
could
not
stir
could
not
lift
hand
or
foot
and
his
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
her
steps
grew
more
hesitating
she
seemed
hardly
to
move
and
then
just
as
she
reached
the
spot
where
he
stood
he
found
that
it
was
not
she
after
all
but
madeleine
who
laughed
at
his
disappointment
and
said
not
offended
remember
the
revulsion
of
feeling
was
too
great
he
turned
away
without
taking
the
flowers
she
held
out
to
him
and
awoke
this
dream
was
present
to
him
all
the
morning
like
a
melody
that
haunts
and
recalls
but
he
worked
more
laboriously
than
usual
for
he
was
aggrieved
with
himself
for
having
idled
away
the
previous
afternoon
and
then
too
furst
playing
had
made
a
profound
impression
on
him
in
vigorous
imitation
he
sat
down
to
the
piano
again
after
a
hasty
dinner
snatched
in
the
neighbourhood
but
as
he
was
only
playing
scales
he
propped
open
before
him
a
little
volume
of
goethe
poems
which
johanna
had
lent
him
and
suiting
his
scales
to
the
metre
of
the
lines
read
through
one
after
another
of
the
poems
he
liked
best
at
a
particular
favourite
he
stopped
playing
and
held
the
book
in
both
hands
he
had
hardly
begun
anew
when
the
door
of
his
room
was
unceremoniously
opened
and
dove
entered
in
the
jocose
way
he
adopted
when
in
a
rosy
mood
maurice
made
a
movement
to
conceal
his
book
merely
in
order
to
avoid
the
explanation
he
new
must
follow
but
was
too
late
dove
had
espied
it
he
did
not
belie
himself
on
this
occasion
he
was
extremely
astonished
to
find
maurice
still
at
it
but
much
more
so
to
see
a
book
open
before
him
and
he
vented
his
surprise
loudly
and
wordily
liszt
used
to
read
the
newspaper
said
maurice
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
he
had
swung
round
in
the
and
he
yawned
as
he
spoke
without
attempting
to
disguise
it
why
yes
of
course
why
not
agreed
dove
cordially
afraid
lest
he
had
seemed
discouraging
why
not
indeed
for
those
who
can
do
it
i
wish
i
could
but
will
you
believe
me
guest
here
he
seated
himself
and
settled
into
an
attitude
for
talking
one
hand
inserted
between
his
crossed
knees
will
you
believe
me
when
i
say
i
find
it
a
difficult
business
to
read
at
all
at
any
time
i
find
it
too
stimulating
too
anregend
do
you
know
i
assure
you
for
weeks
now
i
have
been
trying
to
read
past
and
present
and
have
not
yet
got
beyond
the
first
page
it
gives
one
so
much
to
think
about
opens
up
so
many
new
ideas
that
i
stop
myself
and
say
fellow
that
must
be
digested
this
i
see
is
poetry
he
ran
quickly
and
disparagingly
through
little
volume
and
laid
it
down
again
i
do
care
much
for
poetry
myself
or
for
novels
either
there
so
much
in
life
worth
knowing
that
is
true
or
of
some
use
to
one
and
besides
as
we
all
know
fact
is
stranger
than
fiction
they
spoke
also
of
furst
performance
the
evening
before
and
dove
gave
it
its
due
although
he
could
not
conceal
his
opinion
that
star
would
ultimately
pale
before
that
of
a
to
the
town
a
late
addition
to
the
list
of
schwarz
pupils
whom
he
dove
had
been
putting
up
to
things
a
bit
this
was
a
manchester
man
and
former
pupil
of
halle
and
it
would
certainly
not
be
long
before
he
set
the
place
in
a
stir
dove
had
just
come
from
his
lodgings
where
he
had
been
permitted
to
sit
and
hear
him
practise
a
touch
like
velvet
declared
dove
and
a
stretch
i
have
never
seen
anything
like
it
he
spans
a
tenth
nay
an
eleventh
more
easily
than
we
do
an
octave
the
object
of
dove
visit
was
it
transpired
to
propose
that
maurice
should
accompany
him
that
evening
to
the
theatre
where
die
walkure
was
to
be
performed
and
as
on
this
day
dove
had
reasons
for
seeing
the
world
through
glasses
he
suggested
out
of
the
fulness
of
his
heart
that
they
should
also
invite
madeleine
to
join
them
maurice
was
nothing
loath
to
have
the
meeting
with
her
over
and
so
though
it
was
not
quite
three
they
went
together
to
the
mozartstrasse
they
found
madeleine
before
her
which
was
strewn
with
closely
written
sheets
this
was
for
america
she
explained
and
begged
the
young
men
to
excuse
her
finishing
an
important
letter
to
an
american
journalist
with
whom
she
had
once
chummed
up
on
a
trip
to
italy
one
never
knows
when
these
people
may
be
of
use
to
one
she
was
accustomed
to
say
having
addressed
and
stamped
the
envelope
and
tossed
it
to
the
others
she
rose
and
gave
a
hand
to
each
at
maurice
she
smiled
in
a
significant
way
you
should
have
stayed
my
son
some
one
came
after
all
maurice
laid
an
imploring
finger
on
his
lips
but
dove
had
seized
the
opportunity
of
glancing
at
his
cravat
in
the
mirror
and
did
not
seem
to
hear
she
agreed
willingly
to
their
plan
of
going
to
the
theatre
she
had
thought
of
it
herself
then
a
girl
she
knew
had
asked
her
to
come
to
hear
her
play
in
ensemblespiel
however
i
will
let
that
slip
schelper
and
are
to
sing
it
will
be
a
fine
performance
i
suppose
some
one
is
to
be
there
she
said
laughingly
to
dove
or
you
would
not
be
of
the
party
but
dove
only
smiled
and
looked
sly
without
delay
madeleine
began
to
detail
to
maurice
the
leading
motives
on
which
the
walkure
was
built
up
and
dove
having
hummed
strummed
and
whistled
all
those
he
knew
by
heart
settled
down
to
a
discourse
on
the
legitimacy
and
development
of
the
motive
and
especially
in
how
far
it
was
to
be
considered
a
purely
intellectual
implement
he
spoke
with
the
utmost
and
was
so
unconscious
of
being
a
bore
that
it
was
impossible
to
take
him
amiss
madeleine
however
could
not
resist
from
time
to
time
throwing
in
a
really
how
extraordinary
you
do
say
so
among
his
abstruse
remarks
but
her
sarcasm
was
lost
on
dove
and
even
if
he
had
noticed
it
he
would
only
have
smiled
unhit
being
too
sensible
and
easily
to
take
offence
it
was
always
a
mystery
to
his
friends
where
dove
got
his
information
he
was
never
seen
to
read
and
there
was
little
theorising
about
art
little
but
the
practical
knowledge
of
it
in
the
circles
to
which
he
belonged
but
just
as
he
went
about
picking
up
small
items
of
gossip
so
he
also
gathered
in
stray
scraps
of
thought
and
information
and
being
by
nature
endowed
with
an
excellent
memory
he
let
nothing
that
he
had
once
heard
escape
him
he
had
besides
the
talker
gift
of
neatly
stringing
together
these
tags
he
had
pulled
off
other
people
of
connecting
them
and
giving
them
a
varnish
of
originality
by
no
means
a
fool
madeleine
was
in
the
habit
of
saying
of
him
he
would
be
easier
to
deal
with
if
he
were
here
on
the
leading
motive
as
handled
by
wagner
and
forerunners
he
had
an
unwritten
treatise
ripe
in
his
brain
but
he
had
only
just
compared
the
individual
motives
to
the
lettered
ribbons
that
issue
from
the
mouths
of
the
figures
in
medieval
pictures
and
began
to
hint
at
the
idee
fixe
of
berlioz
when
he
was
interrupted
by
a
knock
at
the
door
herein
cried
madeleine
in
her
clear
voice
and
at
the
sight
of
the
person
who
opened
the
door
maurice
involuntarily
started
up
from
his
chair
and
taking
his
stand
behind
it
held
the
back
of
it
firmly
with
both
hands
in
it
was
louise
on
seeing
the
two
young
men
she
hesitated
and
with
the
still
in
her
hand
smiled
a
faint
questioning
smile
at
madeleine
raising
her
eyebrows
and
showing
a
thin
line
of
white
between
her
lips
may
i
come
in
she
asked
with
her
head
a
little
on
one
side
why
of
course
you
know
you
may
said
madeleine
with
some
asperity
and
so
louise
entered
and
came
forward
to
the
table
at
which
they
had
been
sitting
but
before
anything
further
could
be
said
she
raised
her
arms
to
catch
up
a
piece
of
hair
which
had
fallen
loose
on
her
neck
the
young
men
were
standing
waiting
to
greet
her
maurice
still
behind
his
chair
but
she
did
not
hurry
on
their
account
or
just
on
their
account
did
not
hurry
as
madeleine
mentally
remarked
both
watched
louise
and
followed
her
movements
to
their
eyes
she
appeared
to
be
very
simply
dressed
it
was
only
madeleine
who
appreciated
the
cost
and
care
of
this
seeming
simplicity
she
wore
a
plain
black
dress
of
a
smooth
shiny
stuff
which
obeyed
and
emphasised
the
lines
and
outlines
of
her
body
and
as
she
stood
with
her
arms
upraised
composedly
aware
of
being
observed
they
could
see
the
line
of
her
side
rising
and
falling
with
the
rise
and
fall
of
each
breath
otherwise
she
wore
a
large
black
hat
with
feathers
and
an
overhanging
brim
which
threw
shadows
on
her
face
and
made
her
eyes
seem
darker
than
ever
letting
her
arms
drop
with
a
sigh
of
relief
she
shook
hands
with
dove
and
dove
to
madeleine
diversion
and
maurice
intense
disgust
introduced
maurice
to
her
as
his
friend
she
looked
full
at
the
latter
and
held
out
her
hand
but
before
he
could
take
it
she
withdrew
it
again
and
put
both
it
and
her
left
hand
behind
her
back
no
no
she
said
i
must
shake
hands
with
you
today
is
friday
and
to
give
one
hand
for
the
first
time
on
a
friday
would
bring
bad
luck
to
you
if
not
to
me
she
was
serious
but
both
the
others
laughed
and
maurice
having
let
his
outstretched
hand
fall
coloured
and
smiled
rather
foolishly
she
did
not
seem
to
notice
his
discomfiture
turning
to
madeleine
she
began
to
speak
of
a
piece
of
music
she
wished
to
borrow
and
then
maurice
had
a
chance
of
observing
her
at
his
ease
and
of
listening
to
her
voice
in
which
he
heard
all
manner
of
impossible
things
but
while
madeleine
with
dove
assistance
was
looking
through
a
pile
of
music
louise
came
suddenly
up
to
him
and
said
you
are
not
offended
with
me
are
you
she
had
a
low
voice
with
a
childish
cadence
in
it
which
touched
him
like
a
caress
offended
i
with
you
he
meant
to
laugh
but
his
voice
shook
she
stared
at
him
openly
astonished
not
only
at
his
words
but
also
at
the
tone
in
which
they
were
said
and
the
strange
fervent
gaze
bent
on
her
by
this
man
whom
she
saw
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
confused
her
and
made
her
uneasy
slowly
and
coldly
she
turned
away
but
madeleine
who
was
charitably
occupying
dove
as
long
as
she
could
did
not
take
any
notice
of
her
and
as
the
young
man
continued
to
stare
at
her
she
looked
out
of
the
window
at
the
lowering
grey
sky
and
said
with
a
shudder
what
a
day
for
june
all
eyes
followed
hers
maurice
with
the
rest
but
almost
instantly
he
brought
them
back
again
to
her
face
louise
is
a
true
southerner
said
madeleine
and
is
wretched
if
there
a
cloud
in
the
sky
louise
smiled
and
he
saw
her
strong
white
teeth
it
not
quite
as
bad
as
that
she
said
and
then
although
herself
not
clear
why
she
should
have
answered
these
searching
eyes
she
added
looking
at
maurice
i
come
from
australia
if
she
had
said
she
was
a
visitant
from
another
world
maurice
would
not
at
the
moment
have
felt
much
surprise
but
on
hearing
the
name
of
this
distant
land
on
which
he
would
probably
never
set
foot
a
sense
of
desolation
overcame
him
he
realised
anew
with
a
pang
what
an
utter
stranger
he
was
to
her
of
her
past
life
her
home
her
country
he
knew
and
could
know
nothing
that
is
very
far
away
he
said
speaking
out
of
this
feeling
and
then
was
vexed
with
himself
for
having
done
so
his
words
sounded
foolish
as
they
lingered
on
in
the
stillness
that
followed
them
and
would
he
believed
lay
him
open
to
madeleine
ridicule
but
he
had
not
much
time
in
which
to
repent
of
them
the
music
had
been
found
and
she
was
going
again
he
heard
her
refuse
an
invitation
to
stay
she
had
an
engagement
at
four
and
now
dove
who
throughout
had
kept
in
the
background
looked
at
his
watch
and
took
up
his
hat
he
had
previously
offered
unopposed
to
do
the
long
wait
outside
the
theatre
which
was
necessary
when
one
had
no
tickets
and
now
it
was
time
to
go
but
when
louise
heard
the
word
theatre
she
laid
a
slim
ungloved
hand
on
dove
arm
the
very
thing
for
such
a
night
they
all
said
auf
wiedersehen
to
one
another
she
did
not
offer
to
shake
hands
again
and
maurice
nursed
a
faint
hope
that
it
was
on
his
account
he
opened
the
window
leant
out
and
watched
them
until
they
went
round
the
corner
of
the
street
madeleine
smiled
shrewdly
behind
his
back
but
when
he
turned
she
was
grave
she
did
not
make
any
reference
to
what
had
passed
nor
did
she
as
he
feared
she
would
put
questions
to
him
instead
she
showed
him
a
song
of
krafft
and
asked
him
to
play
the
accompaniment
for
her
he
gratefully
consented
without
knowing
what
he
was
undertaking
for
the
song
a
setting
of
a
poem
by
lenau
was
nominally
in
c
sharp
minor
but
it
was
black
with
accidentals
and
passed
through
many
keys
before
it
came
to
a
close
in
d
flat
major
besides
this
the
right
hand
had
much
hard
in
quaint
scales
and
broken
octaves
to
a
syncopated
bass
of
chords
that
were
adapted
to
the
stretch
of
no
ordinary
hand
lieblos
und
ohne
gott
auf
einer
haide
sang
madeleine
on
the
high
f
sharp
but
maurice
having
collected
neither
his
wits
nor
his
fingers
began
blunderingly
could
not
right
himself
and
after
scrambling
through
a
few
bars
came
to
a
dead
stop
and
let
his
hands
fall
from
the
keys
not
madeleine
she
laughed
very
well
not
one
should
ask
you
to
believe
that
die
ganze
welt
ist
zum
verzweifeln
traurig
while
she
made
tea
he
returned
to
the
window
where
he
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
lost
in
thought
he
told
himself
once
more
what
he
found
it
impossible
to
believe
that
he
was
going
to
see
louise
again
in
a
few
hours
and
not
only
to
see
her
but
to
speak
to
her
to
be
at
her
side
and
when
his
jubilation
at
this
had
subsided
he
went
over
in
memory
all
that
had
just
taken
place
his
first
impression
he
could
afford
now
to
admit
it
had
been
almost
one
of
disappointment
that
came
from
having
dreamed
so
long
of
a
shadowy
being
whom
he
had
called
by
her
name
that
the
real
she
was
a
stranger
to
him
everything
about
her
had
been
different
from
what
he
had
expected
her
voice
her
smile
her
gestures
and
in
the
first
moments
of
their
meeting
he
had
been
chill
with
fear
lest
lest
even
yet
he
did
not
venture
to
think
out
the
thought
but
this
first
sensation
of
strangeness
over
he
had
found
her
more
charming
more
desirable
than
even
he
had
hoped
and
what
almost
wrung
a
cry
of
pleasure
from
him
as
he
remembered
it
was
that
not
the
smallest
trifle
no
touch
of
coquetry
no
insincerely
spoken
word
had
marred
the
perfect
impression
of
the
whole
to
know
her
to
stand
before
her
he
recognised
it
now
gave
the
lie
to
false
slander
and
report
hardest
of
all
however
was
it
to
grasp
that
the
meeting
had
actually
come
to
pass
and
was
over
it
had
been
so
ordinary
so
everyday
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
there
had
been
no
blast
of
trumpets
nor
had
any
occult
sympathy
warned
her
that
she
was
in
the
presence
of
one
who
had
trembled
for
weeks
at
the
idea
of
this
moment
and
again
he
leaned
forward
and
gazed
at
the
spot
in
the
street
where
she
had
disappeared
from
sight
he
was
filled
with
envy
of
dove
this
was
the
latter
reward
for
his
unfailing
readiness
to
oblige
others
and
in
fancy
he
saw
dove
walking
street
after
street
at
her
side
in
reality
the
two
parted
from
each
other
shortly
after
turning
the
first
corner
on
any
other
day
dove
would
have
been
still
more
prompt
to
take
leave
of
his
companion
but
on
this
particular
one
he
was
in
the
mood
to
be
a
little
reckless
in
the
morning
he
had
received
with
a
delightful
shock
his
first
letter
from
ephie
a
very
frank
warmly
written
note
in
which
she
relied
on
his
great
kindness
to
secure
her
without
fail
these
words
were
deeply
underscored
two
places
in
the
parquet
of
the
theatre
for
that
evening
performance
not
the
letter
alone
but
also
its
confiding
tone
and
the
reliance
it
placed
in
him
had
touched
dove
to
a
deep
pleasure
he
had
been
one
of
the
first
to
arrive
at
the
that
morning
and
although
he
had
not
ventured
unasked
to
take
himself
a
seat
beside
the
sisters
he
was
now
living
in
the
anticipation
of
promenading
the
foyer
with
them
in
the
intervals
between
the
acts
and
of
afterwards
escorting
them
home
on
leaving
louise
he
made
for
the
theatre
with
a
swinging
stride
had
he
been
in
the
country
stick
in
hand
he
would
have
slashed
off
the
heads
of
innumerable
green
and
flowering
things
as
it
was
he
whistled
an
unusual
thing
for
him
to
do
in
the
street
then
assumed
the
air
of
a
man
hard
pressed
for
time
gradually
the
began
to
look
at
him
with
the
right
amount
of
attention
he
jostled
as
if
by
accident
one
or
two
of
those
who
were
unobservant
then
apologised
for
his
hurry
it
was
not
pleasurable
anticipation
alone
that
was
responsible
for
dove
state
of
mind
and
for
the
heightening
and
radiation
of
his
in
offering
to
go
early
to
the
theatre
and
to
stand
at
the
doors
for
at
least
of
an
hour
in
order
that
the
others
coming
considerably
later
might
still
have
a
chance
of
gaining
their
favourite
seats
in
doing
this
dove
was
not
actuated
by
a
wholly
unselfish
motive
but
by
the
more
complicated
one
which
consciously
or
unconsciously
was
present
beneath
all
the
friendly
cares
and
attentions
he
bestowed
on
people
he
was
never
more
content
with
himself
and
with
the
world
at
large
than
when
he
felt
that
he
was
essential
to
the
comfort
and
of
some
of
his
than
when
he
so
to
speak
had
a
finger
in
the
pie
of
their
existence
it
engendered
a
sense
of
importance
gave
life
fulness
and
variety
and
this
far
outweighed
the
trifling
inconveniences
such
welldoing
implied
indeed
he
throve
on
them
for
in
his
mild
way
dove
had
a
touch
of
caesarean
mania
of
a
lust
for
power
left
to
herself
louise
dufrayer
walked
slowly
home
to
her
room
in
the
bruderstrasse
but
only
to
throw
a
hasty
look
round
it
was
just
as
she
had
expected
although
it
was
long
past
the
appointed
time
he
was
not
there
at
a
in
a
big
adjoining
street
she
bought
a
bunch
of
roses
and
with
these
in
her
hands
went
straight
to
where
schilsky
lived
mounting
to
the
third
floor
of
the
house
in
the
talstrasse
she
opened
without
ceremony
the
door
of
his
room
which
gave
direct
on
the
landing
but
so
stealthily
that
the
young
man
who
was
sitting
with
his
back
to
the
door
did
not
hear
her
enter
before
he
could
turn
she
had
sprung
forward
her
arms
were
round
his
neck
and
the
roses
under
his
nose
he
drew
his
face
away
from
their
damp
fragrance
but
did
not
look
up
and
without
removing
his
cigarette
asked
in
a
tone
of
extreme
bad
temper
what
are
you
doing
here
lulu
what
nonsense
is
this
for
god
sake
shut
the
door
she
ruffled
his
hair
with
her
lips
you
did
come
and
the
day
has
seemed
so
long
he
tried
to
free
himself
putting
the
roses
aside
with
one
hand
while
with
his
cigarette
he
pointed
to
the
sheets
of
that
lay
before
him
for
a
very
good
reason
i
had
no
time
she
went
back
and
closed
the
door
and
then
sitting
down
on
his
knee
unpinned
her
big
hat
and
threw
it
and
the
roses
on
the
bed
he
put
his
arm
round
her
to
steady
her
and
as
soon
as
he
held
her
to
him
his
was
vanquished
he
talked
volubly
of
the
instrumentation
he
was
busy
with
but
she
who
could
point
out
almost
every
fresh
note
he
put
on
paper
saw
plainly
that
he
had
not
been
at
work
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
in
a
miserable
swell
of
doubt
and
jealousy
such
as
she
could
never
subdue
she
asked
were
you
practising
as
well
he
took
no
notice
of
these
words
and
she
did
not
trust
herself
to
say
more
until
with
his
free
hand
he
began
jotting
again
making
notes
that
were
no
bigger
than
then
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
i
have
seen
you
all
day
but
he
was
too
engrossed
to
listen
look
here
he
said
pointing
to
a
bar
that
gave
me
the
deuce
of
a
bother
while
here
and
now
he
explained
to
her
in
detail
the
properties
of
the
in
b
and
the
in
f
and
the
use
to
which
he
intended
to
put
these
instruments
she
heard
him
with
lowered
eyes
lightly
caressing
the
back
of
his
hand
with
her
but
when
he
ceased
speaking
she
rubbed
her
cheek
against
his
it
is
enough
for
lulu
has
been
lonely
not
one
of
his
thoughts
was
with
her
she
saw
that
as
he
answered
i
must
get
this
finished
if
i
can
you
know
well
enough
lulu
when
i
in
the
swing
yes
yes
i
know
if
only
it
would
always
come
just
when
i
want
you
most
her
face
lost
its
brightness
she
rose
from
his
knee
and
roamed
about
the
room
watched
from
the
wall
by
her
pictured
self
but
is
there
ever
a
moment
in
the
day
when
you
do
want
me
you
are
never
satisfied
he
spoke
abstractedly
without
interest
in
the
answer
she
might
make
and
relieved
of
her
weight
leant
forward
again
while
his
fingers
played
some
notes
on
the
table
but
when
she
began
to
let
her
hands
stray
over
the
loose
papers
and
other
articles
that
encumbered
chairs
piano
and
washstand
he
raised
his
head
and
watched
her
with
a
sharp
eye
for
goodness
sake
let
those
things
alone
ca
you
he
said
after
he
had
borne
her
fidgeting
for
some
time
you
have
no
secrets
from
me
i
suppose
she
said
it
with
her
tenderest
smile
but
he
scowled
so
darkly
in
reply
that
she
went
over
to
him
again
to
touch
him
with
her
hand
standing
behind
him
with
her
fingers
in
his
hair
she
said
just
i
wanted
you
so
much
this
morning
i
was
so
depressed
that
i
could
have
killed
myself
he
turned
his
head
to
give
her
a
significant
glance
good
reason
for
the
blues
lulu
i
warned
you
you
want
too
much
of
everything
and
ca
expect
to
escape
a
kater
too
much
she
echoed
quick
to
resent
his
words
does
it
seem
so
to
you
would
days
and
days
of
happiness
be
too
much
after
we
have
been
separated
for
a
week
after
wednesday
night
after
what
you
said
to
me
yesterday
yesterday
i
was
in
the
devil
of
a
temper
why
rake
up
old
scores
now
go
home
or
at
least
keep
quiet
and
let
me
get
something
done
he
shook
his
head
free
of
her
caressing
hand
and
worse
still
scratched
the
place
where
it
had
lain
she
stood
irresolute
not
venturing
to
touch
him
again
looking
hungrily
at
him
her
eyes
fell
on
the
piece
of
neck
smooth
lightly
browned
that
showed
between
his
hair
and
the
low
collar
and
in
an
uncontrollable
rush
of
feeling
she
stooped
and
kissed
it
as
he
accepted
the
caress
without
demur
she
said
i
thought
of
going
to
the
theatre
dear
he
was
pleased
and
showed
it
that
right
it
just
what
you
need
to
cheer
you
up
but
i
want
you
to
come
too
he
struck
the
table
with
his
fist
good
god
ca
you
get
it
into
your
head
that
i
want
to
work
she
laughed
with
ready
bitterness
i
should
think
i
could
nothing
new
you
are
always
busy
when
i
ask
you
to
do
anything
you
have
time
for
everything
and
every
one
but
me
if
this
were
something
you
yourself
wanted
to

first

evening

for

and

to

truth

long
as

a
little
i

at
home
this
evening
eugen
i
ca
do
it
if
you
really
loved
me
you
would
understand
she
flung
herself
across
the
bed
and
sobbed
despairingly
schilsky
who
had
again
made
believe
during
this
outburst
to
be
absorbed
in
his
work
cast
a
look
of
mingled
anger
and
discomfort
at
the
prostrate
figure
and
for
some
few
moments
succeeded
in
continuing
his
occupation
with
a
show
of
indifference
but
as
in
place
of
abating
her
sobs
grew
more
his
own
face
began
to
twitch
and
finally
he
dropped
pencil
and
cigarette
and
with
a
loud
expression
of
annoyance
went
over
to
the
bed
lulu
he
said
persuasively
come
lulu
and
bending
over
her
he
laid
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
and
tried
to
force
her
to
rise
she
resisted
him
with
all
her
might
but
he
was
the
stronger
and
presently
he
had
her
on
her
feet
where
with
her
head
on
his
shoulder
she
wept
out
the
rest
of
her
tears
he
held
her
to
him
and
although
his
face
above
her
was
still
dark
did
what
he
could
to
soothe
her
he
could
never
bear
to
see
or
to
hear
a
woman
cry
and
this
loud
passionate
weeping
so
careless
of
anything
but
itself
racked
his
nerves
and
filled
him
with
an
uneasy
wrath
against
invisible
powers
do
cry
darling
do
cry
he
said
again
and
again
gradually
she
grew
calmer
and
he
too
was
still
but
when
her
sobs
were
hushed
and
she
was
clinging
to
him
in
silence
he
put
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
and
held
her
back
from
him
that
he
might
look
at
her
his
face
wore
a
stubborn
expression
which
she
knew
and
which
made
him
appear
years
older
than
he
was
now
listen
to
me
lulu
he
said
when
you
behave
in
this
way
again
you
wo
see
me
afterwards
for
a
week
i
promise
you
that
and
you
know
i
keep
my
word
instead
of
being
glad
that
i
am
in
the
right
mood
and
can
get
something
done
you
come
here
which
you
know
i
have
repeatedly
forbidden
you
to
do
and
make
a
fool
of
yourself
like
this
i
have
explained
everything
to
you
i
could
not
possibly
stay
on
wednesday
night
why
did
you
time
your
arrival
better
but
it
just
like
you
you
would
throw
the
whole
of
one
future
into
the
balance
for
the
sake
of
a
whim
yesterday
i
was
in
a
beast
of
a
temper
admitted
it
but
that
was
made
all
right
last
night
and
no
one
but
you
would
drag
it
up
again
he
spoke
with
a
kind
of
dogged
restraint
which
only
sometimes
gave
way
when
the
injustice
she
was
guilty
of
forced
itself
upon
him
now
like
a
good
girl
go
home
go
to
the
theatre
and
enjoy
yourself
i
do
mind
you
being
happy
without
me
at
least
go
under
any
circumstances
you
ought
not
to
be
here
how
often
have
i
told
you
that
his
moderation
swept
over
into
the
feverish
irritation
she
knew
so
well
how
to
kindle
in
him
and
his
lisp
became
so
marked
that
he
was
almost
unintelligible
you
wo
have
a
rag
of
reputation
left
if
i
do
care
why
should
you
she
felt
for
his
hand
but
he
turned
his
back
i
wo
have
it
i
tell
you
you
know
what
the
student
underneath
said
the
last
time
he
met
you
on
the
stair
she
pressed
her
handkerchief
to
her
lips
to
keep
from
bursting
anew
into
sobs
and
there
was
a
brief
silence
he
stood
at
the
window
gazing
savagely
at
the
opposite
before
she
said
speak
to
me
like
that
i
going
now
this
moment
i
will
never
do
it
again
never
again
as
he
only
mumbled
disbelief
at
this
she
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
raised
her
face
to
his
her
eyes
were
blurred
and
sunken
with
crying
and
her
lips
were
white
he
knew
every
line
of
her
face
by
heart
he
had
known
it
in
so
many
moods
and
under
so
many
conditions
that
he
was
not
as
sensitive
to
its
influence
as
he
had
once
been
and
he
stood
unwilling
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
while
she
clung
to
him
and
let
him
feel
her
weight
but
he
was
very
fond
of
her
and
as
she
continued
mutely
to
implore
forgiveness
she
lulu
his
lulu
whom
every
one
envied
him
his
hasty
anger
once
more
subsided
he
put
his
arms
round
her
and
kissed
her
she
nestled
in
against
him
at
his
softening
and
for
some
moments
they
stood
like
this
in
the
absolute
physical
agreement
that
always
overcame
their
differences
in
his
arms
with
her
head
on
his
shoulder
she
smoothed
back
his
hair
and
while
she
gazed
with
adoring
eyes
at
this
face
that
constituted
her
world
she
murmured
words
of
endearment
and
all
the
unsatisfactory
day
was
annulled
by
these
few
moments
of
perfect
harmony
it
was
he
who
loosened
his
grasp
now
it
all
right
is
it
no
more
tears
but
you
really
must
be
off
or
you
be
late
yes
and
you
he
had
taken
up
his
violin
and
was
tuning
it
preparatory
to
playing
himself
back
into
the
mood
she
had
dissipated
he
ran
his
fingers
up
and
down
tried
flageolets
and
slashed
chords
across
the
strings
but
when
she
had
sponged
her
face
and
pinned
on
her
hat
he
said
in
response
to
her
beseeching
eyes
which
as
so
often
before
made
the
granting
of
this
one
request
a
touchstone
of
his
love
for
her
look
here
lulu
if
i
possibly
can
i
drop
in
at
the
end
of
the
first
act
look
out
for
me
then
in
the
foyer
and
with
this
she
was
forced
to
be
content
ix
when
shortly
after
five
madeleine
and
maurice
arrived
at
the
new
theatre
they
took
their
places
at
the
end
of
a
queue
which
extended
to
the
corner
of
the
main
building
and
before
they
had
stood
very
long
so
many
fresh
people
had
been
added
to
the
line
that
it
had
lengthened
out
until
it
all
but
reached
the
arch
of
the
dove
was
well
to
the
fore
and
would
be
one
of
the
first
to
gain
the
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
still
to
elapse
before
the
doors
opened
and
maurice
borrowed
his
companion
textbook
and
read
studiously
to
acquaint
himself
with
the
plot
of
the
opera
madeleine
took
out
wolzogen
fuhrer
with
the
intention
of
brushing
up
her
knowledge
of
the
motives
but
before
she
had
finished
a
page
she
had
grown
so
interested
in
what
two
people
behind
her
were
saying
that
she
turned
and
took
part
in
the
conversation
the
broad
expanse
of
the
augustusplatz
facing
the
theatre
was
bare
and
sunny
a
policeman
arrived
and
ordered
the
queue
in
a
straighter
line
then
he
strolled
up
and
down
stroking
and
smoothing
his
white
gloves
more
people
came
hurrying
over
the
square
to
the
theatre
and
ranged
themselves
at
the
end
of
the
tail
as
the
hands
of
the
big
clock
on
the
neared
the
quarter
past
five
a
kind
of
tremor
ran
through
the
waiting
line
it
gathered
itself
more
compactly
together
one
clock
after
another
boomed
the
single
stroke
sounds
came
from
within
the
building
the
burly
policeman
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
the
line
there
was
a
noise
of
drawn
bolts
and
grating
locks
and
after
a
moment
suspense
light
shone
out
and
the
big
door
was
flung
open
gent
ly
shouted
the
policeman
but
the
leaders
of
the
queue
charged
with
a
will
and
about
a
dozen
people
had
dashed
forward
before
he
could
throw
down
a
stemming
arm
on
which
those
thus
hindered
leaned
as
on
a
bar
of
iron
madeleine
and
maurice
were
to
the
front
of
the
second
batch
and
the
arm
down
in
they
flew
also
madeleine
leading
through
the
at
the
side
of
the
corridor
up
the
steep
wooden
stairs
one
flight
after
another
higher
and
higher
round
and
round
past
one
two
three
tiers
a
mad
race
which
ended
almost
in
the
arms
of
the
at
the
topmost
gallery
dove
was
waiting
with
the
tickets
and
they
easily
secured
the
desired
places
not
in
the
middle
of
the
gallery
where
as
madeleine
explained
while
she
tucked
her
hat
and
jacket
under
the
seat
the
monstrous
chandelier
hid
the
greater
part
of
the
stage
but
at
the
side
next
the
lattice
that
separated
the
seats
at
from
those
at
fifty
pfennigs
this
is
for
seeing
said
maurice
madeleine
laughed
you
see
too
much
that
the
trouble
wait
till
you
watched
the
men
running
about
the
bottom
of
the
rhine
working
the
cages
the
swim
in
as
yet
with
the
exception
of
the
gallery
the
great
building
was
empty
now
the
iron
rose
but
the
sunken
well
of
the
orchestra
was
in
darkness
and
the
expanse
of
seats
on
the
ground
floor
far
below
was
still
encased
in
white
wrappings
her
and
there
an
attendant
began
to
peel
them
off
maurice
poring
over
his
book
had
to
strain
his
eyes
to
read
and
this
added
to
the
difficulty
of
the
german
and
his
own
sense
of
pleasurable
excitement
made
him
soon
give
up
the
attempt
and
attend
wholly
to
what
madeleine
was
saying
it
was
hot
already
and
the
air
of
the
crowded
gallery
was
permeated
with
various
pungent
odours
some
people
behind
them
were
eating
a
sausage
and
the
man
on
the
other
side
of
the
lattice
reeked
of
cheap
tobacco
when
they
had
been
in
their
seats
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
lights
throughout
the
theatre
went
up
and
directly
afterwards
the
lower
tiers
and
the
ground
floor
were
sprinkled
with
figures
one
by
one
the
members
of
the
orchestra
dropped
in
turned
up
the
lamps
attached
to
their
stands
and
taking
their
instruments
commenced
to
tune
and
flourish
and
soon
stray
motives
and
scraps
of
motives
came
mounting
up
like
lost
birds
from
wind
and
strings
the
man
of
the
drums
beat
a
soft
rattatoo
and
applied
his
ear
to
the
skins
of
his
instruments
now
the
players
were
in
their
seats
waiting
for
the
conductor
in
the
audience
entered
with
an
air
of
guilty
haste
the
chief
curtain
had
risen
and
the
stage
was
hidden
only
by
stuff
curtains
bordered
with
a
runic
scroll
a
delightful
sense
of
expectation
pervaded
the
theatre
maurice
had
more
than
once
looked
furtively
at
his
watch
and
at
every
fresh
noise
behind
him
he
turned
his
head
turned
so
often
that
the
people
in
the
back
seats
grew
suspicious
and
whispered
to
one
another
madeleine
had
drawn
his
attention
to
everything
worth
noticing
and
now
with
her
at
her
eyes
she
pointed
out
to
him
people
whom
he
ought
to
know
dove
having
eaten
a
at
the
buffet
on
the
stair
had
ever
since
sat
with
his
glued
to
his
face
and
only
at
this
moment
did
he
remove
it
with
a
sigh
of
relief
there
they
are
said
madeleine
and
showed
maurice
the
place
in
the
parquet
where
ephie
and
johanna
cayhill
were
sitting
but
the
young
man
only
glanced
cursorily
in
the
direction
she
indicated
he
was
wondering
why
louise
did
not
come
the
time
had
all
but
gone
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
ask
partly
from
fear
of
being
disappointed
partly
because
now
that
he
knew
her
it
was
harder
than
before
to
bring
her
name
over
his
lips
but
the
conductor
had
entered
by
the
he
stood
speaking
to
the
first
violinist
and
the
next
moment
would
climb
into
his
seat
the
players
held
their
instruments
in
readiness
and
a
question
trembled
on
maurice
tongue
but
at
this
very
moment
a
peremptory
fanfare
rang
out
behind
the
scene
and
madeleine
said
the
sword
motive
maurice
to
add
in
the
same
breath
there
louise
he
looked
behind
him
where
she
nudged
him
not
here
you
silly
she
said
in
a
loud
whisper
surely
you
have
been
expecting
her
to
come
up
here
parquet
fourth
row
from
the
front
between
two
women
in
plaid
dresses
oh
now
the
lights
have
gone
ssh
said
at
least
half
a
dozen
people
about
them
her
voice
was
audible
above
the
growling
of
the
thunder
maurice
took
her
and
notwithstanding
the
darkness
into
which
the
theatre
had
been
plunged
travelled
his
eyes
up
and
down
the
row
she
named
naturally
without
success
when
the
curtains
parted
and
disclosed
the
stage
it
was
a
little
lighter
but
not
light
enough
for
him
he
could
not
find
the
plaids
or
rather
there
were
only
plaids
in
the
row
and
there
was
also
more
than
one
head
that
resembled
hers
to
know
that
she
was
there
was
enough
to
distract
him
and
he
was
conscious
of
the
music
and
action
of
the
opera
merely
as
something
that
was
going
on
outside
him
until
he
received
another
sharp
nudge
from
madeleine
on
his
righthand
side
you
not
attending
and
this
is
the
only
act
you
be
able
to
make
anything
of
he
gave
a
guilty
start
and
turned
to
the
stage
where
hunding
had
just
entered
to
a
pompous
measure
in
his
endeavours
to
understand
what
followed
he
was
aided
by
his
companions
who
prompted
him
alternately
but
siegmund
narration
seemed
endless
and
his
thoughts
wandered
in
spite
of
himself
listen
to
this
said
dove
of
a
sudden
it
one
of
the
few
songs
wagner
has
written
he
swayed
his
head
from
side
to
side
to
the
opening
bars
of
the
and
maurice
found
the
rhythm
so
inviting
that
he
began
keeping
time
with
his
foot
to
the
indignation
of
a
policeman
behind
them
who
gave
an
angry
pst
one
of
the
finest
that
was
ever
written
whispered
madeleine
in
her
decisive
way
and
maurice
believed
her
from
this
point
on
the
music
took
him
up
and
carried
him
with
it
and
when
the
great
doors
burst
open
and
let
in
the
spring
night
he
applauded
vigorously
with
the
rest
keeping
it
up
so
long
that
dove
disappeared
and
madeleine
grew
impatient
let
us
go
the
interval
is
none
too
long
they
went
downstairs
to
the
first
floor
of
the
building
and
entered
a
long
broad
brilliantly
lighted
corridor
here
the
majority
of
the
audience
was
walking
round
and
round
in
a
procession
of
twos
and
threes
groups
of
people
also
stood
at
both
ends
and
looked
on
others
went
in
and
out
of
the
doors
that
opened
on
the
great
loggia
madeleine
and
maurice
joined
the
perambulating
throng
madeleine
bowing
and
smiling
to
her
acquaintances
maurice
eagerly
scanning
the
faces
that
came
towards
him
on
the
opposite
side
suddenly
a
stout
gentleman
in
gold
spectacles
kid
gloves
tight
to
bursting
and
a
brown
frock
coat
over
the
amplitude
of
which
was
slung
an
started
up
from
a
corner
and
seizing
both
hands
worked
them
up
and
down
at
the
same
time
he
made
a
ceremonious
little
speech
about
the
length
of
time
that
had
elapsed
since
their
last
meeting
and
paid
her
a
specious
compliment
on
the
taste
she
displayed
in
being
present
at
so
serious
an
opera
madeleine
laughed
and
said
a
few
words
in
her
hard
facile
german
the
best
was
yet
to
come
die
moran
was
divine
as
brunnhilde
having
bowed
and
said
lohse
to
maurice
the
stranger
took
no
further
notice
of
him
but
drawing
madeleine
hand
through
his
arm
in
a
manner
half
gallant
half
paternal
invited
her
to
take
ices
with
him
at
the
adjoining
buffet
maurice
remained
standing
in
a
corner
scrutinising
those
who
passed
him
he
exchanged
a
few
words
with
one
of
his
companions
of
the
a
chemical
student
called
dickensey
who
had
a
reputation
for
his
cynicism
he
had
just
asked
maurice
whether
siegmund
reminded
him
more
of
a
or
a
prizefighter
and
had
offered
to
lay
a
bet
that
he
would
never
attend
a
performance
in
this
theatre
when
the
doors
of
hunding
house
flew
open
or
the
sword
lit
up
at
exactly
the
right
moment
when
maurice
caught
sight
of
dove
and
the
cayhills
he
excused
himself
and
went
to
join
them
not
one
of
the
three
looked
happy
johanna
was
unspeakably
bored
and
did
not
conceal
it
she
gazed
with
contempt
on
the
noisy
excited
crowd
dove
was
not
only
burning
to
devote
himself
to
ephie
he
had
also
got
himself
into
a
dilemma
and
was
at
this
moment
doing
his
best
to
explain
the
first
act
of
the
opera
to
johanna
without
touching
on
the
relationship
of
the
lovers
his
face
was
red
with
the
effort
and
he
hailed
maurice
appearance
as
a
welcome
diversion
but
ephie
too
greeted
him
with
pleasure
and
touching
his
arm
drew
him
back
so
that
they
dropped
behind
the
others
she
was
coquettishly
dressed
this
evening
and
looked
so
charming
that
people
drew
one
attention
to
die
reizende
kleine
engladnderin
but
maurice
soon
discovered
that
she
was
out
of
spirits
and
disposed
to
be
cross
for
fear
lest
he
was
the
offender
he
asked
if
she
had
quite
forgiven
him
and
if
they
were
good
friends
again
oh
i
had
forgotten
all
about
it
but
a
moment
after
she
was
grave
and
quiet
altogether
unlike
herself
are
you
not
enjoying
yourself
ephie
no
i
not
i
think
it
stupid
and
they
all
so
fat
this
referred
to
the
singers
and
was
indisputable
maurice
could
only
agree
with
her
and
try
to
rally
her
meanwhile
he
continued
surreptitiously
to
scour
the
hall
with
an
evergrowing
sense
of
disappointment
then
suddenly
among
those
who
were
passing
in
the
opposite
direction
he
saw
louise
in
a
flash
he
understood
why
he
had
not
been
able
to
find
her
in
the
row
of
seats
he
had
looked
for
her
in
a
black
dress
and
she
was
all
in
white
with
heavy
white
lace
at
her
neck
her
companion
was
an
englishman
called
eggis
of
whom
it
was
rumoured
that
he
had
found
it
advisable
abruptly
to
leave
his
native
land
here
he
made
a
precarious
living
by
journalism
and
by
doing
odd
jobs
for
the
consulate
in
spite
of
his
shabby
clothes
this
man
prematurely
bald
with
dissipated
features
had
polished
manners
and
an
air
of
refinement
and
thoroughly
enjoying
his
position
he
was
talking
to
his
companion
with
vivacity
it
was
plain
that
louise
was
only
half
listening
to
him
with
a
faint
absent
smile
on
her
lips
she
too
restlessly
scanned
the
crowd
they
all
caught
sight
of
schilsky
at
the
same
moment
and
maurice
on
whom
nothing
was
lost
saw
as
well
the
quick
look
that
passed
between
louise
and
him
and
its
immediate
effect
louise
flashed
into
a
smile
and
was
full
of
gracious
attentiveness
to
the
little
man
at
her
side
schilsky
leant
against
the
wall
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
conspicuous
head
well
back
on
entering
the
foyer
he
had
been
pounced
on
by
miss
jensen
the
latter
showily
dressed
in
a
stuff
had
in
tow
a
about
half
her
own
size
whom
she
was
rarely
to
be
seen
without
but
on
this
occasion
the
wan
little
american
stood
disconsolately
apart
for
miss
jensen
was
paying
no
attention
to
him
in
common
with
the
rest
of
her
sex
she
had
a
weakness
for
schilsky
and
besides
on
this
evening
she
needed
specially
receptive
ears
for
she
had
been
studying
the
role
of
sieglinde
and
was
full
of
criticisms
and
objections
as
ephie
and
maurice
passed
them
she
nodded
to
the
latter
and
said
good
evening
neighbour
while
schilsky
seizing
the
chance
broke
away
without
troubling
to
excuse
himself
thus
deserted
miss
jensen
detained
maurice
and
so
he
lost
the
couple
he
wanted
to
keep
in
sight
but
at
the
first
pause
in
the
conversation
ephie
plucked
at
his
sleeve
let
us
go
out
on
the
balcony
they
went
outside
on
the
loggia
where
groups
of
people
stood
refreshing
themselves
in
the
mild
evening
air
which
was
pleasant
with
the
scent
of
lilac
ephie
led
the
way
and
maurice
followed
her
to
the
edge
of
the
parapet
where
they
leaned
against
one
of
the
pillars
here
he
found
himself
again
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
other
two
louise
leaning
both
hands
on
the
was
looking
out
over
the
square
but
schilsky
lounging
as
before
with
his
legs
crossed
his
hands
in
his
pockets
had
his
back
to
it
and
was
letting
his
eyes
range
indifferently
over
the
faces
before
him
as
maurice
and
ephie
came
up
he
yawned
long
and
heartily
and
in
so
doing
showed
all
his
defective
teeth
furtively
watching
them
maurice
saw
him
lean
towards
his
companion
and
say
something
to
her
at
the
same
time
he
touched
with
his
fingertips
the
lace
she
wore
at
the
front
of
her
dress
the
familiarity
of
the
action
grated
on
maurice
and
he
turned
away
his
head
when
he
looked
again
a
moment
or
two
later
he
was
disturbed
anew
louise
was
leaning
forward
still
in
the
same
position
but
schilsky
was
plainly
conversing
by
means
of
signs
with
some
one
else
he
frowned
half
closed
his
eyes
shook
his
head
and
as
if
by
chance
laid
a
finger
on
his
lips
who
he
doing
that
to
maurice
asked
himself
and
followed
the
direction
of
the
other
eyes
which
were
fixed
on
the
corner
where
he
and
ephie
stood
he
turned
and
looked
from
side
to
side
and
as
he
did
this
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
ephie
face
which
made
him
observe
her
more
nearly
it
was
flushed
and
she
was
gazing
hard
at
schilsky
with
a
rush
of
enlightenment
maurice
looked
back
at
the
young
man
but
this
time
schilsky
saw
that
he
was
being
watched
stooping
he
said
a
nonchalant
word
to
his
companion
and
thereupon
they
went
indoors
again
all
this
passed
like
a
flash
but
it
left
none
the
less
a
disagreeable
impression
and
before
maurice
had
recovered
from
it
ephie
said
let
us
go
in
they
pressed
towards
the
door
i
poor
company
ephie
he
said
feeling
already
the
need
of
apologising
to
her
for
his
ridiculous
suspicion
but
you
are
quiet
too
he
glanced
down
at
her
as
he
spoke
and
again
was
startled
her
expression
was
set
and
defiant
but
her
baby
lips
trembled
what
the
matter
i
believe
you
are
angry
with
me
for
being
so
silent
i
guess
it
does
make
any
difference
to
me
whether
you
talk
or
not
she
replied
pettishly
but
i
think
it
just
as
dull
and
stupid
as
it
can
be
i
wish
i
had
come
would
you
like
to
go
home
of
course
i
would
i
stop
now
i
here
oh
ca
we
go
quicker
how
slow
you
are
do
make
haste
he
thought
he
heard
tears
in
her
voice
and
looked
at
her
in
perplexity
while
he
contemplated
getting
her
into
a
quiet
corner
and
making
her
tell
him
truthfully
what
the
matter
was
they
came
upon
madeleine
who
had
been
searching
everywhere
for
maurice
madeleine
had
more
colour
in
her
cheeks
than
usual
and
in
the
pleasing
consciousness
that
she
was
having
a
successful
evening
she
brought
her
good
spirits
to
bear
on
ephie
who
stood
fidgeting
beside
them
you
look
nice
child
she
remarked
in
her
patronising
way
your
dress
is
very
pretty
but
why
is
your
face
so
red
one
would
think
you
had
been
crying
ephie
growing
still
redder
tossed
her
head
it
no
wonder
sure
the
theatre
is
as
hot
as
an
oven
but
at
least
my
nose
is
red
as
well
madeleine
was
on
the
point
of
retorting
but
at
this
moment
the
interval
came
to
an
end
and
the
electric
bells
rang
shrilly
the
people
who
were
nearest
the
doors
went
out
at
once
upstairs
and
down
among
the
first
were
louise
and
schilsky
the
latter
head
as
usual
visible
above
every
one
else
i
will
go
too
said
ephie
hurriedly
no
do
bother
to
come
with
me
i
find
my
way
all
right
i
guess
the
others
are
in
front
there
something
wrong
with
that
child
said
madeleine
as
she
and
maurice
climbed
to
the
gallery
pert
little
thing
but
i
suppose
even
such
have
their
troubles
i
suppose
they
have
said
maurice
he
had
just
realised
that
the
interval
was
over
and
with
it
more
of
the
hopes
he
had
nursed
dove
was
already
in
his
seat
eating
another
roll
he
moved
along
to
make
room
for
them
but
not
a
word
was
to
be
got
out
of
him
and
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
eating
he
raised
the
to
his
eyes
again
behind
his
back
madeleine
whispered
a
mischievous
remark
to
maurice
but
the
latter
smiled
wintrily
in
return
he
had
searched
swiftly
and
thoroughly
up
and
down
the
fourth
row
of
the
parquet
only
to
find
that
louise
was
not
in
it
this
time
there
could
be
no
doubt
whatever
not
a
single
white
dress
was
in
the
row
and
towards
the
middle
a
seat
was
vacant
they
had
gone
home
then
he
would
not
see
her
again
and
once
more
the
provoking
darkness
enveloped
the
theatre
this
second
act
had
no
meaning
for
him
and
he
found
the
various
scenes
intolerably
long
dove
volunteered
no
further
aid
and
explanations
were
insufficient
he
was
perplexed
and
bored
and
when
the
curtains
fell
joined
in
the
applause
merely
to
save
appearances
the
others
rose
but
he
said
he
would
not
go
downstairs
and
when
they
had
drawn
back
to
let
dove
push
by
and
hurry
away
madeleine
said
she
too
would
stay
however
they
would
at
least
go
into
the
corridor
where
the
air
was
better
after
they
had
promenaded
several
times
up
and
down
they
descended
to
a
lower
floor
and
there
through
a
little
window
that
gave
on
the
foyer
below
they
watched
the
living
stream
which
underneath
was
going
round
as
before
madeleine
talked
without
a
pause
look
at
dove
she
pointed
him
out
as
he
went
by
with
the
two
sisters
did
you
ever
see
such
a
gloomy
air
he
might
sit
for
werther
and
oh
look
there
boehmer
with
his
widow
see
the
pretty
fattish
little
woman
she
over
forty
and
has
buried
two
husbands
but
is
crazy
about
boehmer
they
say
she
going
to
marry
him
though
more
than
twenty
years
younger
than
she
is
at
this
juncture
to
his
astonishment
maurice
saw
schilsky
and
louise
he
uttered
an
involuntary
exclamation
and
madeleine
understood
it
she
stopped
her
gossip
to
say
you
thought
she
had
gone
did
you
probably
she
has
only
changed
her
seat
they
do
that
sometimes
he
hates
parquet
and
after
a
pause
how
cross
she
looks
evidently
in
a
temper
about
something
i
never
saw
people
hide
their
feelings
as
badly
as
they
do
it
positively
indecent
her
strictures
were
justifiable
as
long
as
the
two
below
were
in
sight
and
as
often
as
they
came
round
they
did
not
exchange
word
or
look
with
each
other
schilsky
frowned
sulkily
and
his
body
seemed
to
hang
together
more
loosely
than
usual
while
as
for
louise
maurice
staring
hard
from
his
point
of
vantage
could
not
have
believed
it
possible
for
her
face
to
change
in
this
way
she
looked
suddenly
older
and
very
tired
and
her
mobile
mouth
was
hard
when
an
hour
later
after
a
tedious
colloquy
between
brunnhilde
and
wotan
this
long
and
disappointing
evening
came
to
an
end
to
the
more
human
strains
of
the
feuerzauber
and
they
the
last
of
the
to
leave
had
tramped
down
the
wooden
stairs
maurice
heart
leapt
to
his
throat
to
discover
as
they
turned
the
last
bend
not
only
the
two
cayhills
waiting
for
them
but
also
a
little
distance
further
off
louise
she
stood
there
in
her
white
dress
with
a
thin
scarf
over
her
head
madeleine
was
surprised
too
louise
is
it
you
and
alone
the
girl
did
not
respond
i
want
to
borrow
some
money
from
you
madeleine
about
five
or
six
marks
she
said
without
smiling
in
one
of
those
colourless
voices
that
preclude
further
questioning
madeleine
was
not
sure
if
she
had
more
than
a
couple
of
marks
in
her
purse
and
confirmed
this
on
looking
through
it
under
a
lamp
but
both
young
men
put
their
hands
in
their
pockets
and
the
required
sum
was
made
up
as
they
walked
across
the
square
louise
explained
dressed
and
ready
to
start
for
the
theatre
she
had
not
been
able
to
find
her
purse
i
looked
everywhere
and
yet
i
had
it
only
this
morning
at
the
last
moment
i
came
down
here
to
markwald
he
knows
me
and
he
let
me
have
the
seats
on
trust
i
said
i
would
go
in
afterwards
they
waited
outside
the
tobacconist
while
she
settled
her
debt
before
she
came
out
again
madeleine
cast
her
eyes
over
the
group
and
having
made
a
rapid
surmise
said
to
johanna
well
i
suppose
we
shall
walk
together
as
far
as
we
can
shall
you
and
i
lead
off
maurice
had
a
sudden
vision
of
bliss
but
no
sooner
had
louise
appeared
again
with
the
shopman
bowing
behind
her
then
ephie
came
round
to
his
side
with
a
naive
air
that
admitted
of
no
rebuff
and
asked
him
to
carry
her
dove
and
louise
brought
up
the
rear
but
dove
had
only
one
thought
to
be
in
maurice
place
ephie
had
behaved
so
strangely
in
the
theatre
he
had
certainly
done
something
to
offend
her
and
although
he
had
more
than
once
gone
over
his
conduct
of
the
past
week
without
finding
any
want
of
correctness
on
his
part
whatever
it
was
he
must
make
it
good
without
delay
you
know
my
friend
guest
i
think
he
said
at
last
having
racked
his
brains
to
no
better
result
not
for
the
world
would
he
have
had
his
companion
suspect
his
anxiety
to
leave
her
he
a
clever
fellow
a
very
clever
fellow
schwarz
thinks
a
great
deal
of
him
i
wonder
what
his
impressions
of
the
opera
were
this
was
his
first
experience
of
wagner
it
would
be
interesting
to
hear
what
he
has
to
say
louise
was
moody
and
preoccupied
but
dove
words
made
her
smile
let
us
ask
him
she
said
they
quickened
their
steps
and
overtook
the
others
and
when
dove
without
further
ado
had
marched
round
to
ephie
side
louise
left
slightly
to
herself
called
maurice
back
to
her
mr
guest
we
want
your
opinion
of
the
walkure
confused
to
find
her
suddenly
beside
him
maurice
was
still
more
disconcerted
at
the
marked
way
in
which
she
slackened
her
pace
to
let
the
other
two
get
in
front
believing
too
that
he
heard
a
note
of
mockery
in
her
voice
he
coloured
and
hesitated
only
a
moment
ago
he
had
had
several
things
worth
saying
on
his
tongue
now
they
would
not
out
he
stammered
a
few
words
and
broke
down
in
them
she
said
nothing
and
after
one
of
the
most
embarrassing
pauses
he
had
ever
experienced
he
avowed
in
a
burst
of
forlorn
courage
to
tell
the
truth
i
did
not
hear
much
of
the
music
but
louise
who
had
merely
exchanged
one
chance
companion
for
another
did
not
ask
the
reason
or
display
any
interest
in
his
confession
and
they
went
on
in
silence
maurice
looked
stealthily
at
her
her
white
scarf
had
slipped
back
and
her
wavy
head
was
bare
she
had
not
heard
what
he
said
he
told
himself
her
thoughts
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
but
as
he
stole
glances
at
her
thus
unreproved
he
wakened
to
a
sudden
consciousness
of
what
was
happening
to
him
here
and
now
after
long
weeks
of
waiting
he
was
walking
at
her
side
he
knew
her
was
alone
with
her
in
the
summer
darkness
and
though
a
cold
hand
gripped
his
throat
at
the
thought
he
took
the
resolve
not
to
let
this
moment
pass
him
by
he
must
say
something
that
would
rouse
her
to
the
fact
of
his
existence
something
that
would
linger
in
her
mind
and
make
her
remember
him
when
he
was
not
there
but
they
were
half
way
down
the
grimmaischestrasse
at
the
end
where
the
peterstrasse
crossed
it
dove
and
the
cayhills
would
branch
off
and
madeleine
return
to
them
he
had
no
time
to
choose
his
phrases
when
i
was
introduced
to
you
this
afternoon
miss
dufrayer
you
did
not
know
who
i
was
he
said
bluntly
but
i
knew
you
very
well
by
sight
i
mean
of
course
i
have
seen
you
often
very
often
he
had
done
what
he
had
hoped
to
do
had
arrested
her
attention
she
turned
and
considered
him
struck
by
the
tone
in
which
he
spoke
the
first
time
i
saw
you
continued
maurice
with
the
same
show
of
boldness
you
of
course
will
not
remember
it
it
was
one
evening
in
schwarz
room
in
april
months
ago
and
since
then
i
well
i
she
was
gazing
at
him
now
in
surprise
she
remembered
at
this
minute
how
once
before
that
day
his
manner
of
saying
some
simple
thing
had
affected
her
disagreeably
then
she
had
eluded
the
matter
with
an
indifferent
word
now
she
was
not
in
a
mood
to
do
this
or
in
a
mood
to
show
leniency
she
was
dispirited
at
war
with
herself
and
she
welcomed
the
excuse
to
vent
her
own
bitterness
on
another
and
since
then
well
since
then
he
hesitated
and
gave
a
nervous
laugh
at
his
own
daring
since
then
well
i
have
thought
about
you
more
than
than
is
good
for
my
peace
of
mind
for
a
moment
amazement
kept
her
silent
then
she
too
laughed
and
the
walls
of
the
dark
houses
they
were
passing
seemed
to
the
young
man
to
the
sound
your
peace
of
mind
she
repeated
the
words
after
him
with
such
an
ironical
emphasis
that
his
unreflected
courage
curled
and
shrivelled
he
wished
the
ground
had
swallowed
him
up
before
he
had
said
them
for
as
they
fell
from
her
lips
the
audacity
he
had
been
guilty
of
and
the
absurdity
that
was
latent
in
the
words
themselves
struck
him
in
the
face
like
pellets
of
hail
your
peace
of
mind
what
has
your
peace
of
mind
to
do
with
me
she
cried
growing
extravagantly
angry
i
never
saw
you
in
my
life
till
i
may
never
see
you
again
and
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
whether
i
do
or
oh
my
own
peace
of
mind
as
you
call
it
is
quite
hard
enough
to
take
care
of
without
having
a
stranger
thrown
at
me
what
do
you
mean
by
making
me
responsible
for
it
i
have
never
done
anything
to
you
all
the
foolish
castles
maurice
had
built
came
tumbling
about
his
cars
he
grew
pale
and
did
not
venture
to
look
at
her
make
you
responsible
oh
how
can
you
misunderstand
me
so
cruelly
his
consternation
was
so
palpable
that
it
touched
her
in
spite
of
herself
her
face
had
been
as
naively
miserable
as
a
child
now
it
softened
and
she
spoke
more
kindly
do
mind
what
i
say
i
am
tired
have
a
headache
anything
you
like
a
wave
of
compassion
drowned
his
petty
feelings
of
injury
and
his
sympathy
found
vent
in
a
few
inadequate
words
help
me
you
she
laughed
in
an
unhappy
way
to
help
one
must
understand
and
you
could
understand
though
you
tried
all
you
others
lead
such
quiet
lives
you
know
nothing
of
what
goes
on
in
a
life
like
mine
every
day
i
ask
myself
why
i
have
not
thrown
myself
out
of
the
window
or
over
one
of
the
bridges
into
the
river
and
put
an
end
to
it
wrapped
up
though
she
was
in
herself
she
could
not
help
smiling
at
his
frank
gesture
of
dismay
do
be
afraid
she
said
and
the
smile
lingered
on
her
lips
i
shall
never
do
it
i
too
fond
of
life
and
too
afraid
of
death
but
at
least
she
caught
herself
up
again
you
will
see
how
ridiculous
it
is
for
you
to
talk
to
me
of
your
peace
of
mind
peace
of
mind
i
have
never
even
been
passably
content
something
is
always
wanting
for
instance
i
feel
so
much
energy
in
me
and
i
can
make
nothing
of
it
nothing
if
i
were
a
man
i
should
walk
for
hours
bareheaded
through
the
woods
but
to
be
a
woman
to
be
cooped
up
inside
four
walls
when
the
night
itself
is
not
large
enough
to
hold
it
all
she
threw
out
her
hands
to
emphasise
her
helplessness
then
let
them
drop
to
her
sides
again
there
was
a
silence
for
maurice
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
her
fluency
made
him
he
struggled
with
his
embarrassment
until
they
were
all
but
within
earshot
of
the
rest
at
the
bottom
of
the
street
if
i
if
you
would
let
me
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
i
would
do
to
help
you
he
ended
fervently
she
did
not
reply
they
had
reached
the
corner
where
the
others
waited
there
was
a
general
through
a
kind
of
mist
maurice
saw
that
ephie
face
still
wore
a
hostile
look
and
she
hardly
moved
her
lips
when
she
bade
him
madeleine
drew
her
own
conclusions
as
she
walked
the
rest
of
the
way
home
between
two
pale
and
silent
people
she
had
seen
on
coming
out
of
the
theatre
that
louise
was
in
one
of
her
bad
moods
a
fact
easily
to
be
accounted
for
by
schilsky
absence
maurice
had
evidently
been
made
to
suffer
under
it
too
for
not
a
syllable
was
to
be
drawn
from
him
and
after
several
unavailing
attempts
she
let
him
alone
as
they
crossed
the
rossplatz
which
lay
wide
and
deserted
in
the
starlight
louise
said
abruptly
suppose
instead
of
going
home
we
walk
to
connewitz
at
this
proposal
and
at
maurice
seconding
of
it
madeleine
laughed
with
healthy
derision
that
is
just
like
one
of
your
crazy
notions
she
said
what
a
creature
you
are
for
my
part
i
decline
with
thanks
i
have
to
get
a
moscheles
etude
ready
by
afternoon
and
need
all
my
wits
but
do
let
me
hinder
you
walk
to
grimma
if
you
want
to
what
do
you
say
shall
you
and
i
go
on
louise
turned
to
maurice
and
the
young
man
did
not
know
whether
she
spoke
in
jest
or
in
earnest
madeleine
knew
her
better
louise
she
said
warningly
maurice
has
work
to
do
too
you
thought
i
meant
it
said
the
girl
and
laughed
so
ungovernably
that
madeleine
was
again
driven
to
remonstrance
for
goodness
sake
be
quiet
we
shall
have
a
policeman
after
us
if
you
laugh
like
that
nothing
more
was
said
until
they
stood
before
the
housedoor
in
the
bruderstrasse
there
louise
who
had
lapsed
once
more
into
her
former
indifference
asked
madeleine
to
come
upstairs
with
her
i
will
look
for
the
purse
again
and
then
i
can
give
you
what
i
owe
you
or
else
i
am
sure
to
forget
oh
it
still
early
and
the
night
is
so
long
no
one
can
think
of
sleep
yet
madeleine
was
not
a
but
she
was
also
not
averse
to
having
a
debt
paid
louise
looked
from
her
to
maurice
will
you
come
too
mr
guest
it
will
only
take
a
few
minutes
she
said
and
seeing
his
unhappy
face
and
remembering
what
had
passed
between
them
she
spoke
more
gently
than
she
had
yet
done
maurice
felt
that
he
ought
to
refuse
it
was
late
but
madeleine
answered
for
him
of
course
come
along
maurice
and
he
crossed
the
threshold
behind
them
after
lighting
a
taper
they
entered
a
paved
vestibule
and
mounted
a
flight
of
broad
and
very
shallow
stairs
up
there
was
a
deep
recess
for
and
a
wooden
seat
was
attached
to
the
wall
the
house
had
been
a
fine
one
in
its
day
it
was
solidly
built
had
massive
doors
with
heavy
brass
fittings
and
thick
mahogany
banisters
on
the
first
floor
were
two
doors
a
large
and
a
small
one
side
by
side
louise
unlocked
the
larger
and
they
stepped
into
a
commodious
lobby
off
which
several
rooms
opened
she
led
the
way
to
the
furthest
of
these
and
entered
in
front
of
her
companions
maurice
hesitating
just
inside
the
door
found
himself
close
to
a
grand
piano
which
stood
free
on
all
sides
was
open
and
disorderly
with
music
it
was
a
large
room
with
three
windows
and
one
end
of
it
was
shut
off
by
a
high
screen
which
stretched
almost
from
wall
to
wall
a
deep
sofa
stood
in
an
a
was
covered
with
and
three
tall
were
filled
with
purple
lilac
but
there
was
a
general
air
of
untidiness
about
the
room
for
strewn
over
the
chairs
and
tables
were
numerous
small
articles
of
dress
and
the
a
veil
a
hat
and
a
skirt
all
traces
of
her
intimate
presence
as
she
lifted
the
lamp
from
the
to
place
it
on
the
square
table
before
the
sofa
madeleine
called
her
attention
to
a
folded
paper
that
had
lain
beneath
it
it
seems
to
be
a
letter
for
you
she
caught
at
it
with
a
kind
of
avidity
tore
it
open
and
heedless
of
their
presence
devoured
it
not
only
with
her
eyes
but
with
her
parted
lips
and
eager
hands
when
she
looked
up
again
her
cheeks
had
a
tinge
of
colour
in
them
her
eyes
shone
like
faceted
jewels
her
smile
was
radiant
and
infectious
with
no
regard
for
appearances
she
buttoned
the
note
in
the
bosom
of
her
dress
now
we
will
look
for
the
purse
she
said
but
come
in
mr
guest
you
are
still
standing
at
the
door
i
shall
think
you
are
offended
with
me
oh
how
hot
the
room
is
and
the
lilac
is
stifling
first
the
windows
open
and
then
this
scarf
off
and
some
more
light
you
will
help
me
to
look
will
you
not
it
was
to
maurice
she
spoke
with
a
childlike
upturning
of
her
face
to
his
an
irresistibly
confiding
gesture
she
disappeared
behind
the
screen
and
came
out
bareheaded
nestling
with
both
hands
at
the
coil
of
hair
on
her
neck
then
she
lit
two
candles
that
stood
on
the
piano
in
brass
candlesticks
and
maurice
lighted
her
round
the
room
while
she
searched
in
likely
and
unlikely
places
inside
the
piano
in
empty
vases
in
the
folds
of
the
curtains
laughing
at
herself
as
she
did
so
until
madeleine
said
that
this
was
only
nonsense
and
came
after
them
herself
when
maurice
held
the
candle
above
the
he
lighted
three
large
photographs
of
schilsky
one
more
dandified
than
the
other
and
he
was
obliged
to
raise
his
other
hand
to
steady
the
candlestick
at
last
following
a
hint
from
madeleine
they
discovered
the
purse
between
the
back
of
the
sofa
and
the
seat
and
now
louise
remembered
that
it
had
been
in
the
pocket
of
her
that
afternoon
how
stupid
of
me
i
might
have
known
she
said
contritely
so
many
things
have
gone
down
there
in
their
day
once
a
silver
that
i
was
fond
of
and
i
sometimes
look
there
when
bangles
or
are
missing
and
letting
her
eyes
dance
at
maurice
she
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
here
however
another
difficulty
arose
except
for
a
few
nickel
coins
the
purse
was
found
to
contain
only
gold
and
the
required
change
could
not
be
made
up
never
mind
take
one
of
the
pieces
she
urged
yes
madeleine
i
would
rather
you
did
and
when
madeleine
hinted
that
maurice
might
not
find
it
too
troublesome
to
come
back
with
the
change
the
following
day
she
turned
to
the
young
man
and
saying
yes
if
mr
guest
would
be
so
kind
smiled
at
him
with
such
a
gracious
warmth
that
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
reply
with
a
decent
unconcern
but
the
hands
of
the
clock
on
the
were
nearing
eleven
and
now
it
was
she
who
referred
to
the
lateness
of
the
hour
thank
you
very
much
she
said
to
maurice
on
parting
and
you
must
forget
the
nonsense
i
talked
this
evening
i
did
mean
it
not
a
word
of
it
she
laughed
and
held
out
her
hand
i
would
shake
hands
with
you
this
afternoon
but
now
if
you
will
for
i
am
not
superstitious
nothing
bad
will
happen
i
sure
of
that
and
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
everything
good
night
only
a
few
minutes
back
he
had
been
steeped
in
pity
for
her
now
it
seemed
as
if
no
one
had
less
need
of
pity
or
sympathy
than
she
he
was
bewildered
and
went
home
to
pass
alternately
from
a
mood
of
rapture
to
one
of
jealous
despair
and
the
latter
was
torturous
for
as
they
walked
madeleine
had
let
fall
such
a
vile
suspicion
that
he
had
parted
from
her
in
anger
calling
as
he
went
that
if
he
believed
what
she
said
to
be
true
he
would
never
put
faith
in
a
human
being
again
in
the
light
of
the
morning
of
course
he
knew
that
it
was
incredible
a
mere
phantasm
born
of
the
dark
and
towards
four
that
afternoon
he
called
at
the
bruderstrasse
with
the
change
but
louise
was
not
at
home
and
as
he
did
not
find
her
in
on
three
successive
days
he
did
not
venture
to
return
he
wrote
his
name
on
a
card
and
left
this
together
with
the
money
in
an
envelope
x
after
parting
from
the
rest
dove
and
the
two
cayhills
continued
their
way
in
silence
they
were
in
the
shadow
thrown
by
the
steep
vaulting
of
the
thomaskirche
before
a
word
was
exchanged
between
them
johanna
had
several
times
glanced
inquiringly
at
her
sister
but
ephie
had
turned
away
her
head
so
that
only
the
outline
of
her
cheek
was
visible
and
as
dove
had
done
exactly
the
same
johanna
could
only
conclude
that
the
two
had
fallen
out
it
was
something
novel
for
her
to
be
obliged
to
talk
when
ephie
was
present
but
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
walk
the
whole
way
home
as
mum
as
this
especially
as
dove
had
already
heaved
more
than
one
deep
sigh
so
as
they
turned
into
the
promenade
johanna
said
with
a
jerk
and
with
an
aggressiveness
that
she
could
not
subdue
well
that
is
the
first
and
the
last
time
anyone
shall
persuade
me
to
go
to
a
opera
by
wagner
is
not
that
just
a
little
rash
asked
dove
he
smiled
unruffled
with
a
suggestion
of
patronage
but
there
was
also
a
preoccupation
in
his
manner
which
showed
that
he
was
thinking
of
other
things
you
call
that
music
said
johanna
although
he
had
done
nothing
of
the
kind
i
call
it
noise
i
am
not
musical
myself
thank
goodness
but
at
least
i
know
a
tune
when
i
hear
one
if
my
opinion
had
been
asked
i
should
certainly
have
suggested
something
lighter
lohengrin
or
tannhauser
for
instance
said
dove
you
would
have
done
us
a
favour
if
you
had
replied
johanna
and
she
meant
what
she
said
in
more
ways
than
one
she
had
been
at
a
loss
to
account
for
ephie
sudden
longing
to
hear
die
walkure
and
had
gone
to
the
theatre
against
her
will
simply
because
she
never
thwarted
ephie
if
she
could
avoid
it
now
after
she
had
heard
the
opera
she
felt
aggrieved
with
dove
as
well
as
far
as
she
had
been
able
to
gather
from
his
vague
explanations
from
the
bawling
of
the
singers
and
from
subsequent
events
the
first
act
treated
of
relations
so
infamous
that
by
common
consent
they
are
considered
and
johanna
was
of
the
opinion
that
instead
of
being
so
ready
to
take
tickets
for
them
dove
might
have
let
drop
a
hint
of
the
nature
of
the
piece
ephie
wished
to
see
after
this
last
remark
of
johanna
there
was
another
lengthy
pause
then
dove
looking
fondly
at
what
he
could
see
of
ephie
cheek
said
i
am
afraid
miss
ephie
has
not
enjoyed
it
either
she
is
so
quiet
so
unlike
herself
ephie
who
had
been
staring
into
the
darkness
bit
her
lip
he
was
at
it
again
after
the
unfriendly
way
in
which
maurice
guest
had
deserted
her
and
forced
her
into
dove
company
dove
had
worried
her
right
down
the
grimmaischestrasse
to
know
what
the
matter
was
and
how
he
had
offended
her
she
felt
exasperated
with
every
one
and
if
he
began
his
worryings
again
would
have
to
vent
her
irritation
somehow
ephie
has
only
herself
to
blame
if
she
did
enjoy
it
she
was
bent
on
going
said
johanna
in
the
mildly
didactic
manner
she
invariably
used
towards
her
sister
but
i
think
she
is
only
tired
or
a
little
cross
oh
that
is
not
likely
dove
hastened
to
interpose
i
am
not
cross
joan
said
ephie
angrily
and
if
it
was
my
fault
you
had
to
come
i
enjoyed
myself
very
much
and
i
shall
go
again
as
often
as
i
like
but
i
wo
be
teased
i
wo
indeed
this
was
the
sharpest
answer
johanna
had
ever
received
from
ephie
she
looked
at
her
in
dismay
but
made
no
response
for
of
nothing
was
johanna
more
afraid
than
of
losing
the
goodwill
ephie
bore
her
mentally
she
put
her
sister
pettishness
down
to
the
noise
and
heat
of
the
theatre
and
it
was
an
additional
reason
for
bearing
wagner
and
his
music
a
grudge
dove
also
made
no
further
effort
to
converse
connectedly
but
his
silence
was
of
a
conciliatory
kind
and
as
they
advanced
along
the
promenade
he
could
not
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
drawing
the
pretty
perverse
child
attention
to
the
crossings
the
ruts
in
the
road
the
best
bits
of
pavement
with
a
walk
you
here
miss
ephie
take
care
allow
me
himself
meanwhile
dancing
from
one
side
of
the
footpath
to
the
other
until
the
young
girl
was
almost
distracted
i
can
see
for
myself
thank
you
i
have
eyes
in
my
head
as
well
as
anyone
else
she
exclaimed
at
length
and
to
johanna
amazed
ephie
she
retorted
yes
joan
you
think
no
one
has
a
right
to
be
rude
but
yourself
johanna
was
more
hurt
by
these
words
than
she
would
have
confessed
she
had
hitherto
believed
that
ephie
affectionate
lazy
little
ephie
accepted
her
individual
peculiarities
as
an
integral
part
of
her
nature
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
that
ephie
might
be
standing
aloof
and
considering
her
objectively
let
alone
mentally
using
such
an
unkind
word
as
rudeness
of
her
but
ephie
fit
of
for
such
it
undoubtedly
was
made
johanna
see
things
differently
it
hinted
at
unsuspected
cold
scrutinies
in
the
past
and
implied
a
somewhat
laming
care
of
one
words
in
the
days
to
come
which
would
render
it
difficult
ever
again
to
be
one
perfectly
natural
self
had
johanna
not
been
so
occupied
with
her
own
feelings
she
would
have
heard
the
near
tears
in
ephie
voice
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
the
girl
kept
them
back
and
at
the
she
had
vanished
up
the
stairs
long
before
dove
had
finished
saying
in
the
corridor
she
hesitated
whether
or
no
according
to
custom
she
should
go
to
her
mother
room
then
she
put
a
brave
face
on
it
and
opened
the
door
here
we
are
mummy
good
night
i
hope
the
evening
was
too
long
long
on
the
contrary
the
hours
had
flown
cayhill
left
to
herself
had
all
the
comfortable
sensations
of
a
tippler
in
the
company
of
his
bottle
she
could
forge
ahead
undeterred
by
any
sense
of
duty
she
had
not
to
interrupt
herself
to
laugh
at
ephie
wit
nor
was
she
troubled
by
johanna
cold
eye
that
eye
which
told
more
plainly
than
words
how
her
elder
daughter
regarded
her
propped
up
in
bed
on
two
pillows
she
now
laid
down
her
book
and
put
out
her
hand
to
draw
ephie
to
her
did
you
enjoy
it
darling
were
you
amused
but
you
will
tell
me
all
about
it
in
the
morning
yes
mother
in
the
morning
i
am
a
little
tired
but
it
was
very
sweet
said
ephie
bravely
good
night
cayhill
kissed
her
and
nodded
in
perfect
contentment
at
the
pretty
little
figure
before
her
ephie
was
free
to
go
and
at
last
she
was
in
her
own
room
at
last
she
hastily
locked
both
doors
one
leading
to
the
passage
and
one
to
her
sister
room
a
moment
later
johanna
was
at
the
latter
trying
to
open
it
ephie
what
is
the
matter
why
have
you
locked
the
door
open
it
at
once
i
insist
upon
it
she
cried
anxiously
and
as
loudly
as
she
dared
for
fear
of
disturbing
the
other
inmates
of
the
house
but
ephie
begged
hard
not
to
be
bothered
she
had
a
bad
headache
and
only
wanted
to
be
quiet
let
me
give
you
a
powder
urged
her
sister
you
are
so
excited
i
am
sure
you
are
not
well
and
when
this
too
was
refused
you
had
nothing
but
some
tea
child
you
must
be
hungry
and
they
have
left
our
supper
on
the
table
no
she
was
not
hungry
did
want
any
supper
and
was
very
sleepy
well
at
least
unlock
your
door
begged
johanna
with
visions
of
the
dark
practices
which
ephie
the
soul
of
candour
might
be
contemplating
on
the
other
side
i
will
not
come
in
i
promise
you
she
added
oh
all
right
said
ephie
crossly
but
as
soon
as
she
heard
that
johanna
had
gone
she
returned
to
the
middle
of
the
room
without
touching
the
door
and
after
standing
undecided
for
a
moment
as
if
not
quite
sure
what
was
coming
next
she
sat
down
on
a
chair
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
suddenly
began
to
cry
the
tears
had
been
in
waiting
for
so
long
that
they
flowed
without
effort
abundantly
rolling
one
over
another
down
her
cheeks
but
she
was
careful
not
to
make
a
sound
for
even
when
sobbing
bitterly
she
did
not
forget
that
at
any
moment
johanna
might
enter
the
adjoining
room
and
overhear
her
and
then
what
a
fuss
there
would
be
for
ephie
was
one
of
those
fortunate
people
who
always
get
what
they
want
and
but
rarely
have
occasion
to
cry
all
her
desires
had
moved
low
near
earth
and
been
easily
fulfilled
did
she
break
her
prettiest
doll
a
still
prettier
was
forthcoming
did
anything
happen
to
cross
wish
or
scheme
of
hers
half
a
dozen
brains
were
at
work
to
think
out
a
compensation
but
now
she
wept
in
earnest
behind
closed
doors
for
she
had
received
an
injury
which
no
one
could
make
good
and
the
more
she
thought
of
it
the
more
copiously
her
tears
flowed
the
evening
had
been
one
long
tragedy
of
disappointment
her
fevered
anticipation
beforehand
her
early
throbs
of
excitement
in
the
theatre
her
growing
consternation
as
the
evening
advanced
her
mortification
at
being
slighted
a
sensation
which
she
experienced
for
the
first
time
again
and
again
she
asked
herself
what
she
had
done
to
be
treated
in
this
way
what
had
happened
to
change
him
she
was
sitting
upright
on
her
chair
letting
the
tears
stream
unchecked
her
two
hands
lay
upturned
on
her
knee
in
one
of
them
was
a
diminutive
lace
handkerchief
rolled
to
a
ball
with
which
now
and
then
she
dabbed
away
the
hottest
tears
the
windows
of
the
room
were
still
open
the
blinds
undrawn
and
the
threw
a
flickering
mesh
of
light
on
the
wall
in
the
glass
that
hung
over
the
washstand
she
saw
her
dim
reflection
following
an
impulse
she
dried
her
eyes
and
with
trembling
fingers
lighted
two
candles
one
on
each
side
of
the
mirror
by
this
uncertain
light
she
leant
forward
with
both
hands
on
the
stand
and
peered
at
herself
with
a
new
curiosity
she
was
still
just
as
she
had
come
out
of
the
theatre
a
silk
scarf
was
twisted
round
her
head
and
the
brilliant
dangling
fringes
and
the
stray
tendrils
of
hair
that
escaped
made
a
frame
for
the
rounded
oval
of
her
face
and
then
her
skin
was
so
fine
her
eyes
were
so
bright
the
straight
lashes
so
black
and
so
long
she
put
her
head
back
looked
at
herself
through
lids
turned
her
face
this
way
and
that
even
smiling
wet
though
her
cheeks
were
in
order
that
she
might
see
the
even
line
of
teeth
with
their
slightly
notched
edges
the
smile
was
still
on
her
lips
when
the
tears
welled
up
again
ran
over
trickled
down
and
dropped
with
a
splash
she
watching
them
until
a
big
unexpected
sob
rose
in
her
throat
and
almost
choked
her
yes
she
was
pretty
oh
very
very
pretty
but
it
made
what
had
happened
all
the
harder
to
understand
how
had
he
had
the
heart
to
treat
her
so
cruelly
she
knelt
down
by
the
open
window
and
laid
her
head
on
the
sill
the
moon
a
mere
sharp
line
of
silver
hung
fine
and
slender
like
a
polished
scimitar
above
the
dark
mass
of
houses
opposite
turning
her
hot
face
up
to
it
she
saw
that
it
was
new
and
instantly
felt
a
throb
of
relief
that
she
had
not
caught
her
first
glimpse
of
it
through
glass
she
bowed
her
head
to
it
quickly
nine
times
running
and
sent
up
a
prayer
to
the
deity
of
fortune
that
had
its
home
there
good
luck
the
fulfilment
of
one
wish
she
wished
in
haste
with
eyes
and
who
knew
but
what
the
very
next
day
her
wish
might
come
true
tired
with
crying
above
all
tired
of
the
grief
itself
she
began
more
and
more
to
let
her
thoughts
stray
to
the
morrow
and
having
once
yielded
to
the
allurements
of
hope
she
even
endeavoured
to
make
the
best
of
the
past
evening
telling
herself
that
she
had
not
been
alone
for
a
single
instant
he
had
really
had
no
chance
of
speaking
to
her
in
the
next
breath
of
course
she
reminded
herself
that
he
might
easily
have
made
a
chance
had
he
wished
and
a
healthier
feeling
of
resentment
stole
over
her
rising
from
her
cramped
position
she
shut
the
window
she
resolved
to
show
him
that
she
was
not
a
person
who
could
be
treated
in
this
fashion
he
should
see
that
she
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
but
she
played
with
her
unhappiness
a
little
longer
and
even
had
an
idea
of
throwing
herself
on
the
bed
without
undressing
she
was
very
sleepy
though
and
the
desire
to
be
between
the
cool
soft
sheets
was
too
strong
to
be
withstood
she
slipped
out
of
her
clothes
leaving
them
just
where
they
fell
on
the
floor
like
round
pools
and
before
she
had
finished
plaiting
her
hair
she
was
stifling
a
hearty
yawn
but
in
bed
when
the
light
was
out
she
lay
and
stared
before
her
i
am
very
very
unhappy
i
shall
not
sleep
a
wink
she
said
to
herself
and
sighed
at
the
prospect
of
the
but
before
five
minutes
had
passed
her
closed
hand
relaxed
and
lay
open
and
innocent
on
the
coverlet
her
breath
came
regularly
she
was
fast
asleep
the
moon
was
visible
for
a
time
in
the
setting
of
the
unshuttered
window
and
when
she
wakened
next
day
toward
nine
the
full
morning
sun
was
playing
on
the
bed
for
several
months
prior
to
this
ephie
had
worshipped
schilsky
at
a
distance
the
very
first
time
she
saw
him
play
he
had
made
a
profound
impression
on
her
he
looked
so
earnest
and
melancholy
so
supremely
indifferent
to
every
one
about
him
as
he
stood
with
his
head
bent
to
his
violin
then
too
he
had
beautiful
hands
and
she
did
not
know
which
she
admired
more
his
auburn
hair
with
the
big
hat
set
so
jauntily
on
it
or
the
thrillingly
impertinent
way
he
had
of
staring
at
you
through
eyes
with
his
head
well
back
in
a
manner
at
once
daring
and
irresistible
having
come
through
a
period
of
low
spirits
caused
by
an
acute
consciousness
of
her
own
littleness
and
inferiority
ephie
so
far
recovered
her
that
she
was
able
to
look
at
her
divinity
when
she
met
him
and
soon
after
this
she
made
the
intoxicating
discovery
that
not
only
did
he
return
her
look
but
that
he
also
took
notice
of
her
and
deliberately
singled
her
out
with
his
gaze
and
the
belief
was
pardonable
on
ephie
part
for
schilsky
made
it
a
point
of
honour
to
stare
any
pretty
girl
into
confusion
besides
which
he
had
a
habit
of
falling
into
reveries
in
which
he
saw
no
more
of
what
or
whom
he
looked
at
than
do
the
glassy
eyes
of
the
blind
more
than
once
ephie
had
blushed
and
writhed
in
blissful
torture
under
these
stonily
staring
eyes
from
this
to
persuading
herself
that
her
feelings
were
returned
was
only
a
step
events
and
details
lighter
than
were
to
her
links
of
iron
which
formed
a
wonderful
chain
of
evidence
she
went
about
nursing
the
idea
that
schilsky
desired
an
introduction
as
much
as
she
did
that
he
was
suffering
from
a
romantic
and
melancholy
attachment
which
forbade
him
attempting
to
approach
her
at
this
date
she
became
an
adept
at
inventing
excuses
to
go
to
the
conservatorium
when
she
thought
he
was
likely
to
be
there
and
suddenly
grown
rebellious
she
shook
off
johanna
protectorship
which
until
now
had
weighed
lightly
on
her
she
grew
fastidious
about
her
dress
studied
before
the
glass
which
colours
suited
her
best
and
the
effect
of
a
particular
bow
or
ribbon
while
on
the
days
she
had
her
she
developed
a
coquetry
which
made
nothing
seem
good
enough
to
wear
and
was
the
despair
of
johanna
when
schilsky
played
at
an
abendunterhaltung
she
sat
in
the
front
row
of
seats
and
made
her
hands
ache
with
applauding
afterwards
she
lay
wakeful
with
hot
cheeks
and
dreamt
extravagant
dreams
of
sending
him
great
baskets
and
bouquets
of
flowers
with
coloured
streamers
to
them
such
as
the
singers
in
the
opera
received
on
a
gala
night
and
though
no
name
was
given
he
would
know
from
whom
they
came
but
on
the
only
occasion
she
tried
to
carry
out
the
scheme
and
ventured
inside
a
florist
shop
her
scant
command
of
german
and
the
excessive
circumstantiality
of
the
matter
made
her
feel
so
uncomfortable
that
she
had
fled
precipitately
leaving
the
shopman
staring
after
her
in
surprise
things
were
at
this
pass
when
one
day
late
in
may
ephie
went
as
usual
to
take
her
lesson
it
was
two
on
a
cloudless
afternoon
and
so
warm
that
the
budding
lilac
in
squares
and
gardens
began
to
give
out
fragrance
in
the
whitewashed
corridors
of
the
conservatorium
the
light
was
harsh
and
shadowless
it
jarred
on
one
wounded
the
nerves
so
at
least
thought
schilsky
who
was
hanging
about
the
top
storey
of
the
building
in
extreme
he
had
been
forced
to
make
an
appointment
with
a
man
to
whom
he
owed
money
the
latter
had
not
yet
appeared
and
schilsky
lounged
and
swore
with
his
two
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
and
his
sulkiest
expression
but
gradually
he
found
himself
listening
to
the
discordant
tones
of
a
violin
at
first
unconsciously
as
we
listen
when
our
thoughts
are
elsewhere
engaged
then
more
and
more
intently
in
one
of
the
junior
masters
rooms
some
one
had
begun
to
play
scales
in
the
third
position
uncertainly
with
shrill
feebleness
seeking
out
each
note
only
to
produce
it
falsely
as
this
scraping
worked
on
him
schilsky
could
not
refrain
from
rubbing
his
teeth
together
and
screwing
up
his
face
as
though
he
had
toothache
now
that
the
miserable
little
tones
had
successfully
penetrated
his
ear
they
hit
him
like
so
many
blows
damn
him
for
a
fool
he
said
savagely
to
himself
and
found
an
outlet
for
his
irritation
in
repeating
these
words
aloud
then
however
as
an
etude
was
commenced
with
an
impotence
that
struck
him
as
purely
vicious
he
could
endure
the
torment
no
longer
he
had
seen
in
the
bureau
the
particular
master
and
knew
that
the
latter
had
not
yet
come
upstairs
going
to
the
room
from
which
the
sounds
issued
he
stealthily
opened
the
door
a
girl
was
standing
with
her
back
to
him
and
was
so
engrossed
in
playing
that
she
did
not
hear
him
enter
on
seeing
this
he
proposed
to
himself
the
schoolboy
pleasure
of
creeping
up
behind
her
and
giving
her
a
fright
he
did
so
with
such
effect
that
had
he
not
caught
it
her
violin
would
have
fallen
to
the
floor
he
took
both
her
wrists
in
his
held
them
firm
and
from
his
superior
height
he
was
head
and
shoulders
taller
than
ephie
looked
down
on
the
miscreant
he
recognised
her
now
as
a
pretty
little
american
whom
he
had
noticed
from
time
to
time
about
the
building
but
but
well
that
she
was
as
astoundingly
pretty
as
this
he
had
had
no
notion
his
eyes
strayed
over
her
face
picking
out
all
its
beauties
and
he
felt
himself
growing
as
soft
as
butter
besides
she
had
crimsoned
down
to
her
bare
dimpled
neck
her
head
drooped
her
long
lashes
covered
her
eyes
and
a
tremulous
smile
touched
the
corners
of
her
mouth
which
seemed
uncertain
whether
to
laugh
or
to
cry
the
short
trembled
he
felt
from
her
wrists
and
saw
from
the
uneasy
movement
of
her
breast
how
wildly
her
heart
was
beating
it
was
as
if
one
held
a
bird
in
one
hand
his
ferocity
died
away
none
of
the
hard
words
he
had
had
ready
crossed
his
lips
all
he
said
and
in
his
gentlest
voice
was
have
i
frightened
you
he
was
desperately
curious
to
know
the
colour
of
her
eyes
and
as
she
neither
answered
him
nor
looked
up
but
only
grew
more
and
more
confused
he
let
one
of
her
hands
fall
and
taking
her
by
the
chin
turned
her
face
up
to
his
she
was
forced
to
look
at
him
for
a
moment
upon
which
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
on
the
mouth
three
times
with
a
pause
between
each
kiss
then
at
a
noise
in
the
corridor
he
swung
hastily
from
the
room
and
was
just
in
time
to
avoid
the
master
against
whom
he
brushed
up
in
going
out
of
the
door
herr
becker
looked
suspiciously
at
his
favourite
pupil
face
and
air
of
extreme
confusion
and
throughout
the
lesson
his
manner
to
her
was
so
cold
and
short
that
ephie
played
worse
than
ever
before
after
sticking
fast
in
the
middle
of
a
passage
she
stopped
altogether
and
begged
to
be
allowed
to
go
home
when
she
had
gone
and
some
one
else
was
playing
herr
becker
stood
at
the
window
and
shook
his
head
round
this
innocent
baby
face
he
had
woven
several
pretty
fancies
meanwhile
ephie
flew
rather
than
walked
home
and
having
reached
her
room
unseen
flung
herself
on
the
bed
and
buried
her
burning
cheeks
in
the
white
coolness
of
the
pillows
johanna
finding
her
thus
a
short
time
after
was
alarmed
put
questions
of
various
kinds
felt
sure
the
sun
had
been
too
hot
for
her
and
finally
stood
over
the
bed
holding
her
unfailing
remedy
a
soothing
powder
for
the
nerves
oh
do
for
goodness
sake
leave
me
alone
joan
said
ephie
i
want
your
powders
i
am
all
right
just
let
me
be
she
drank
the
mixture
however
and
catching
sight
of
johanna
anxious
face
and
aware
that
she
had
been
cross
she
threw
her
arms
round
her
sister
hugged
her
and
called
her
a
dear
old
darling
joan
but
there
was
something
in
the
stormy
tenderness
of
the
embrace
in
the
flushed
cheeks
and
glittering
eyes
that
made
johanna
even
more
uneasy
she
insisted
upon
ephie
lying
still
and
trying
to
sleep
and
after
taking
off
her
shoes
for
her
and
noiselessly
drawing
down
the
blinds
she
went
on
tiptoe
out
of
the
room
ephie
burrowed
more
deeply
in
her
pillow
and
putting
both
hands
to
her
cars
to
shut
out
the
world
went
over
the
details
of
what
had
happened
it
was
like
a
she
walked
lazily
down
the
sunny
corridor
entered
the
and
took
off
her
hat
which
herr
becker
hung
up
for
her
after
having
playfully
examined
it
she
had
just
taken
her
violin
from
its
case
when
he
remembered
something
he
had
to
do
in
the
bureau
and
went
out
of
the
room
bidding
her
practise
her
scales
during
his
absence
she
heard
again
and
smiled
at
the
funny
accent
with
which
he
said
just
a
moment
she
saw
the
bare
walls
of
the
room
the
dust
that
lay
white
on
the
lid
on
the
piano
was
conscious
of
the
difficulties
of
c
sharp
minor
she
even
knew
the
very
note
at
which
he
had
been
beside
her
without
a
word
of
warning
as
suddenly
as
though
he
had
sprung
from
the
earth
she
heard
the
cry
she
had
given
and
felt
his
hands
the
hands
she
had
so
often
admired
clasp
her
wrists
he
was
so
close
to
her
that
she
felt
his
breath
and
knew
the
exact
shape
of
the
diamond
ring
he
wore
on
his
little
finger
she
felt
too
rather
than
saw
the
audacious
admiration
of
his
eyes
and
his
voice
was
not
the
less
caressing
because
a
little
thick
and
then
then
she
burrowed
more
firmly
held
her
ears
more
tightly
to
laughed
a
happy
gurgling
laugh
that
almost
choked
her
never
as
long
as
she
lived
would
she
forget
the
feel
of
his
moustache
as
it
scratched
her
lips
when
she
rose
and
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
it
seemed
extraordinary
that
there
should
be
no
outward
difference
in
her
and
for
several
days
she
did
not
lose
this
sensation
of
being
mysteriously
changed
she
was
quieter
than
usual
and
her
movements
were
a
little
languid
but
a
kind
of
subdued
radiance
peeped
through
and
shone
in
her
eyes
she
waited
confidently
for
something
to
happen
she
did
not
herself
know
what
it
would
be
but
after
the
miracle
that
had
occurred
it
was
beyond
belief
that
things
could
jog
on
in
their
old
familiar
course
and
so
she
waited
and
expected
at
every
letter
the
postman
brought
each
time
the
rang
whenever
she
went
into
the
street
but
after
a
week
had
dragged
itself
to
an
end
and
she
had
not
even
seen
schilsky
again
she
grew
restless
and
unsure
and
sometimes
at
night
when
johanna
thought
she
was
asleep
she
would
stand
at
her
window
and
with
a
very
different
face
from
that
which
she
wore
by
day
put
countless
questions
to
herself
all
of
which
began
with
why
and
how
and
johanna
was
again
beset
by
the
fear
that
ephie
was
sickening
for
an
illness
for
the
child
would
pass
from
bursts
of
rather
forced
gaiety
to
fits
of
real
fretfulness
or
sink
into
brown
studies
from
which
she
wakened
with
a
start
but
if
on
some
such
occasion
johanna
said
to
her
where
are
your
thoughts
ephie
she
would
only
laugh
and
answer
with
a
hug
you
dear
old
from
the
lesson
following
the
eventful
one
ephie
played
truant
on
the
ground
of
headache
partly
because
her
fancy
pictured
him
lying
in
wait
like
an
ogre
to
eat
her
up
and
partly
from
a
poor
little
foolish
fear
lest
he
should
think
her
too
easily
won
now
however
she
blamed
herself
for
not
having
given
him
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
her
and
began
to
frequent
the
conservatorium
assiduously
when
after
ten
long
days
she
saw
him
again
an
unfailing
instinct
guided
her
aright
it
was
in
the
vestibule
as
she
was
leaving
the
building
and
they
met
face
to
face
directly
she
espied
him
though
her
heart
thumped
alarmingly
ephie
tossed
her
head
gazed
fixedly
at
some
distant
object
and
was
altogether
as
haughty
as
her
parted
lips
would
allow
of
and
she
played
her
part
so
well
that
schilsky
attention
was
arrested
he
remembered
who
she
was
and
stared
hard
at
her
as
she
passed
not
only
this
but
pleased
he
could
not
have
told
why
he
turned
and
followed
her
out
and
standing
on
the
steps
looked
after
her
she
went
down
the
street
with
her
head
in
the
air
holding
her
dress
very
high
to
display
a
petticoat
and
clattering
gracefully
on
two
pointed
shoes
he
screwed
up
his
eyes
against
the
sun
in
order
to
see
her
better
he
was
too
but
vanity
forbade
him
to
wear
glasses
and
when
at
the
corner
of
the
street
ephie
rather
spoilt
the
effect
of
her
behaviour
by
throwing
a
hasty
glance
back
he
laughed
and
clicked
his
tongue
against
the
roof
of
his
mouth
verdammt
he
said
with
expression
and
both
on
that
day
and
the
next
when
he
admired
a
ankle
or
a
pretty
petticoat
he
was
reminded
of
the
provoking
little
american
with
the
tossed
head
and
baby
mouth
a
few
days
later
in
the
street
that
ran
alongside
the
gewandhaus
he
saw
her
again
ephie
who
in
the
interval
had
upbraided
herself
incessantly
was
none
the
less
now
the
moment
had
come
about
to
pass
as
before
even
more
frigidly
but
this
time
schilsky
raised
his
hat
with
a
tentative
smile
and
in
order
not
to
appear
childish
she
bowed
ever
so
slightly
when
he
was
safely
past
she
could
not
resist
giving
a
furtive
look
behind
her
and
at
precisely
the
same
moment
he
turned
too
in
spite
of
her
trouble
ephic
found
the
coincidence
droll
she
tittered
and
he
saw
it
although
she
immediately
laid
the
back
of
her
hand
on
her
lips
it
was
not
in
him
to
let
this
pass
unnoticed
with
a
few
quick
steps
he
was
at
her
side
he
took
off
his
hat
again
and
looked
at
her
not
quite
sure
how
to
begin
i
am
happy
to
see
you
have
not
forgotten
me
he
said
in
excellent
english
ephie
had
impulsively
stopped
on
hearing
him
come
up
with
her
and
now
colouring
deeply
tried
to
dig
a
hole
in
the
pavement
with
the
toe
of
her
shoe
she
too
could
not
think
what
to
say
and
this
together
with
the
effect
produced
on
her
by
his
peculiar
lisp
made
her
feel
very
uncomfortable
she
was
painfully
conscious
of
his
insistent
eyes
on
her
face
as
he
waited
for
her
to
speak
but
there
was
a
distressing
pause
before
he
added
and
sorry
to
see
you
are
still
angry
with
me
at
this
she
found
her
tongue
looking
not
at
him
but
at
a
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
she
said
why
i
guess
i
have
a
right
to
be
she
tried
to
speak
severely
but
her
voice
quavered
and
once
more
the
young
man
was
not
sure
whether
the
trembling
of
her
lip
signified
tears
or
laughter
are
you
always
so
cruel
he
asked
with
an
intentness
that
made
her
eyes
seek
the
ground
again
such
a
little
crime
is
there
no
hope
for
me
she
attempted
to
be
dignified
little
i
am
really
not
accustomed
then
i
not
to
be
forgiven
his
tone
was
so
humble
that
suddenly
she
had
to
laugh
shooting
a
quick
glance
at
him
she
said
that
depends
on
how
you
behave
in
future
if
you
promise
never
to
before
the
words
were
well
out
of
her
mouth
she
was
aware
of
her
stupidity
her
laugh
ended
and
she
grew
redder
than
before
schilsky
had
laughed
too
quite
frankly
and
he
continued
to
smile
at
the
confusion
she
had
fallen
into
it
seemed
a
long
time
before
he
said
with
emphasis
that
is
the
last
thing
in
the
world
you
should
ask
of
me
ephie
drooped
her
head
and
dug
with
her
shoe
again
she
had
never
been
so
as
just
when
she
felt
she
ought
to
say
something
very
cold
and
decisive
but
not
an
idea
presented
itself
and
meanwhile
he
went
on
the
punishment
would
be
too
hard
the
temptation
was
so
great
as
she
was
still
obstinately
silent
he
stooped
and
peeped
under
the
overhanging
brim
of
her
hat
such
pretty
lips
he
said
and
then
as
on
the
former
occasion
he
took
her
by
the
chin
and
turned
her
face
up
to
his
but
she
drew
back
angrily
schilskyl
how
dare
you
take
your
hand
away
at
once
there
i
have
sinned
again
he
said
and
folded
his
hands
in
mock
supplication
now
i
am
afraid
you
will
never
forgive
but
listen
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
you
know
my
name
will
you
not
tell
me
yours
having
retreated
a
full
yard
from
him
ephie
regained
some
of
her
native
for
the
first
time
she
found
herself
able
to
look
straight
at
him
no
she
said
with
a
touch
of
her
usual
lightness
i
shall
leave
you
to
find
it
out
for
yourself
it
will
give
you
something
to
do
they
both
laughed
at
least
give
me
your
hand
he
said
and
when
he
held
it
in
his
he
would
not
let
her
go
until
after
much
seeming
reluctance
on
her
part
she
had
detailed
to
him
the
days
and
hours
of
her
lessons
at
the
conservatorium
and
where
he
would
be
likely
to
meet
her
as
before
he
stood
and
watched
her
go
down
the
street
hoping
that
she
would
turn
at
the
corner
but
on
this
day
ephie
whisked
along
in
a
great
hurry
on
after
occasions
he
waylaid
her
as
she
came
and
went
and
either
stood
talking
to
her
or
walked
the
length
of
the
street
beside
her
at
the
early
hour
of
the
afternoon
when
ephie
had
her
lessons
he
did
not
need
to
fear
being
seen
by
acquaintances
the
sunshine
was
undisturbed
in
the
quiet
street
the
second
time
they
met
he
told
her
that
he
had
found
out
what
her
name
was
and
his
efforts
to
pronounce
it
afforded
ephie
much
amusement
their
conversation
was
always
of
the
same
nature
half
banter
half
earnest
ephie
who
had
rapidly
recovered
her
assurance
invariably
began
in
her
archest
manner
and
it
became
his
special
pleasure
to
reduce
her
little
by
little
to
a
crimson
silence
but
one
day
about
a
fortnight
later
she
came
upon
him
at
a
different
hour
when
he
was
not
expecting
to
see
her
he
was
strolling
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
conservatorium
waiting
for
louise
who
might
appear
at
any
moment
ephie
had
been
restless
all
the
morning
and
had
finally
made
an
excuse
to
go
out
her
steps
naturally
carried
her
to
the
conservatorium
where
she
proposed
to
study
the
on
the
chance
of
seeing
schilsky
when
she
caught
sight
of
him
her
eyes
brightened
she
greeted
him
with
an
inviting
smile
and
a
saucy
remark
but
schilsky
did
not
take
up
her
tone
he
cut
her
words
short
what
are
you
doing
here
he
asked
with
a
frown
of
displeasure
meanwhile
keeping
a
watchful
eye
on
the
inner
staircase
visible
through
the
glass
doors
down
which
louise
would
come
i
have
a
moment
to
spare
mortally
offended
by
his
manner
ephie
drew
back
her
extended
hand
and
giving
him
a
look
of
surprise
and
resentment
was
about
to
pass
him
by
without
a
further
word
but
this
was
more
than
schilsky
could
bear
he
put
out
his
hand
to
stop
her
always
though
with
one
eye
on
the
door
now
do
be
cross
little
girl
he
begged
impatiently
it
not
my
fault
upon
my
word
it
is
i
was
expecting
to
see
you
you
know
that
look
here
tell
me
this
sort
of
thing
is
so
unsatisfactory
is
there
no
other
place
i
could
see
you
what
do
you
do
with
yourself
all
day
come
answer
me
do
be
angry
ephie
melted
come
and
visit
us
on
sunday
afternoon
she
said
we
are
always
at
home
then
he
laughed
rudely
and
took
no
notice
of
her
words
come
think
of
something
quick
he
said
he
was
on
tenterhooks
to
be
gone
and
showed
it
ephie
grew
flustered
and
though
she
racked
her
brains
could
make
no
further
suggestion
oh
well
if
you
ca
you
know
he
said
crossly
and
loosened
his
hold
of
her
arm
then
at
the
last
moment
she
had
a
flash
of
inspiration
she
remembered
how
on
the
previous
sunday
dove
had
talked
enthusiastically
of
an
which
if
she
were
not
mistaken
was
to
take
place
the
following
night
dove
had
declared
that
all
musical
leipzig
would
probably
be
present
in
the
theatre
surely
she
might
risk
mentioning
this
without
fear
of
another
snub
i
am
going
to
the
opera
night
she
said
in
a
small
meek
voice
and
was
on
the
verge
of
tears
schilsky
hardly
heard
her
louise
had
appeared
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
the
very
thing
he
said
i
shall
look
out
for
you
there
little
girl
auf
wiedersehen
he
went
down
the
steps
without
even
raising
his
hat
and
when
louise
came
out
he
was
sauntering
towards
the
building
again
as
if
he
had
come
from
the
other
end
of
the
street
ephie
went
home
in
a
state
of
anger
and
humiliation
which
was
new
to
her
for
the
first
few
hours
she
was
resolved
never
to
speak
to
schilsky
again
when
this
mood
passed
she
made
up
her
mind
that
he
should
atone
for
his
behaviour
to
the
last
iota
he
should
grovel
before
her
she
would
scarcely
deign
to
look
at
him
but
the
nearer
the
time
came
for
their
meeting
the
more
were
her
resentful
feelings
swallowed
up
by
the
wish
to
see
him
she
counted
off
the
hours
till
the
opera
commenced
she
concocted
a
scheme
to
escape
surveillance
she
had
a
story
ready
if
it
should
be
necessary
of
how
she
had
once
been
introduced
to
schilsky
her
fingers
trembled
with
impatience
as
she
fastened
on
a
pretty
new
dress
which
had
just
been
sent
home
a
light
flowered
stuff
with
narrow
bands
of
black
velvet
artfully
applied
so
as
to
throw
the
fairness
of
her
hair
and
skin
into
relief
the
consciousness
of
looking
her
best
gave
her
manner
a
light
sureness
that
was
very
charming
but
from
the
moment
they
entered
the
foyer
ephie
heart
began
to
sink
the
crowd
was
great
she
could
not
see
schilsky
and
in
his
place
came
dove
who
was
not
to
be
shaken
off
even
maurice
was
bad
enough
what
concern
of
his
was
it
how
she
enjoyed
herself
when
finally
she
did
discover
the
person
she
sought
he
was
with
some
one
else
and
did
not
see
her
and
when
she
had
succeeded
in
making
him
look
he
frowned
shook
his
head
and
made
angry
signs
that
she
was
not
to
speak
to
him
afterwards
going
downstairs
with
the
sallow
girl
in
white
what
did
it
mean
all
through
the
tedious
second
act
ephie
wound
her
handkerchief
round
and
round
and
in
and
out
of
her
fingers
would
it
never
end
how
long
would
the
fat
ugly
brunnhilde
stand
talking
to
siegmund
and
the
woman
who
lay
so
ungracefully
between
his
knees
as
if
it
mattered
a
straw
what
these
sham
people
did
or
felt
would
he
speak
to
her
in
the
next
interval
or
would
he
not
the
side
curtains
had
hardly
swept
down
before
she
was
up
from
her
seat
hurrying
johanna
away
this
time
she
chose
to
stand
against
the
wall
at
the
end
of
the
foyer
after
a
short
time
he
came
in
sight
but
he
had
no
more
attention
to
spare
for
her
than
before
he
did
not
even
look
in
her
direction
her
one
consolation
was
that
obviously
he
was
not
enjoying
himself
he
wore
a
surly
face
was
not
speaking
and
to
a
remark
the
girl
in
white
made
he
answered
by
an
angry
flap
of
the
hand
when
they
had
twice
gone
past
in
this
way
and
she
had
each
time
vainly
put
herself
forward
ephie
began
to
take
an
interest
in
what
dove
was
saying
to
smile
at
him
and
coquet
with
him
and
the
more
openly
the
nearer
schilsky
drew
other
people
grew
attentive
and
dove
went
into
a
seventh
heaven
which
made
it
hard
for
him
placidly
to
accept
the
fit
of
pettish
silence
she
subsequently
fell
into
the
crowning
touch
was
put
to
this
disastrous
evening
by
the
fact
that
schilsky
companion
of
the
foyer
walked
the
greater
part
of
the
way
home
with
them
and
what
was
worse
that
she
took
not
the
slightest
notice
of
ephie
xi
before
leaving
her
bedroom
the
following
morning
ephie
wrote
on
her
scented
pink
paper
a
short
letter
which
began
dear
schilsky
and
ended
with
your
sincere
friend
euphemia
stokes
cayhill
in
this
letter
she
failed
to
understand
his
conduct
of
the
previous
evening
and
asked
him
for
an
explanation
not
until
she
had
closed
the
envelope
did
she
remember
that
she
was
ignorant
of
his
address
she
bit
the
end
of
her
pen
thinking
hard
and
directly
breakfast
was
over
put
on
her
hat
and
slipped
out
of
the
house
it
was
the
first
time
ephie
had
had
occasion
to
enter
the
bureau
of
the
conservatorium
and
when
the
heavy
door
had
swung
to
behind
her
and
she
was
alone
in
the
presence
of
the
secretaries
each
of
whom
was
bent
over
a
high
desk
writing
in
a
ledger
her
courage
almost
failed
her
the
senior
an
old
man
with
a
benevolent
face
did
not
look
up
but
after
she
had
stood
hesitating
for
some
minutes
an
solemnly
laid
down
his
pen
and
coming
to
the
counter
wished
in
english
to
know
what
he
could
do
for
her
growing
very
red
ephie
asked
him
if
he
would
could
would
please
tell
her
where
schilsky
lived
herr
kleefeld
leaned
both
hands
on
the
counter
and
disconcerted
her
by
staring
at
her
over
his
spectacles
schilsky
is
it
very
important
he
said
with
a
leer
as
if
he
were
making
a
joke
why
yes
indeed
replied
ephie
timidly
he
nodded
his
head
more
to
himself
than
to
her
went
back
to
his
desk
opened
another
ledger
and
ran
his
finger
down
a
page
repeating
aloud
as
he
did
so
to
her
extreme
embarrassment
schilsky
let
me
see
schilsky
let
me
see
after
a
pause
he
handed
her
a
slip
of
paper
on
which
he
had
painstakingly
copied
the
address
talstrasse
iii
why
i
thank
you
very
much
i
have
to
ask
him
about
some
music
is
there
anything
to
pay
stammered
ephie
but
herr
kleefeld
leaning
as
before
on
the
counter
shook
his
head
from
side
to
side
with
a
waggish
air
which
confused
ephie
still
more
she
made
her
escape
and
left
him
there
still
wagging
like
a
china
mandarin
having
addressed
the
letter
in
the
nearest
post
office
she
entered
a
confectioner
and
bought
a
pound
of
chocolate
creams
so
that
when
johanna
met
her
in
the
passage
anxious
and
angry
at
her
leaving
the
house
without
a
word
she
was
able
to
assert
that
her
had
been
empty
and
she
felt
she
could
not
begin
to
practise
till
it
was
refilled
but
johanna
was
very
cantankerous
and
obliged
her
to
study
an
hour
overtime
to
atone
for
her
escapade
then
followed
for
ephie
several
unhappy
days
when
all
the
feeling
she
seemed
capable
of
concentrated
itself
on
the
visits
of
the
postman
she
remained
standing
at
the
window
until
she
had
seen
him
come
up
the
street
and
she
was
regularly
the
first
to
look
through
the
mails
as
they
lay
on
the
lobby
table
two
days
brought
no
reply
to
her
letter
on
the
third
fell
a
lesson
which
she
was
resolved
not
to
take
but
when
the
hour
came
she
dressed
herself
with
care
and
went
as
usual
schilsky
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
half
a
week
later
the
same
thing
was
repeated
except
that
on
this
day
she
made
herself
prettier
than
ever
she
was
like
some
gay
garden
flower
in
a
big
white
hat
round
the
brim
of
which
lay
scarlet
poppies
and
a
dress
of
a
light
blue
which
heightened
the
colour
of
her
cheeks
and
reflected
in
her
eyes
made
them
bluer
than
a
fjord
in
the
sun
but
her
spirits
were
low
if
she
did
not
see
him
this
time
despair
would
crush
her
but
she
did
saw
him
while
she
was
still
some
distance
off
standing
near
the
portico
of
the
conservatorium
and
at
the
sight
of
him
after
the
uncertainty
she
had
gone
through
during
the
past
week
she
could
hardly
keep
back
her
tears
he
did
not
come
to
meet
her
he
stood
and
watched
her
approach
and
only
when
she
reached
him
indolently
held
out
his
hand
as
she
refused
to
notice
it
and
went
to
the
extreme
edge
of
the
pavement
to
avoid
it
he
made
a
barrier
of
his
arms
and
forced
her
to
stand
still
holding
her
thus
with
his
hand
on
her
elbow
he
looked
keenly
at
her
and
in
spite
of
the
obdurate
way
in
which
she
kept
her
eyes
turned
from
him
he
saw
that
she
was
going
to
cry
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
afraid
of
the
threatening
scene
then
with
a
decisive
movement
he
took
her
out
of
her
hand
ephie
made
an
ineffectual
effort
to
get
possession
of
it
again
but
he
held
it
above
her
reach
and
saying
wait
a
minute
ran
up
the
steps
he
came
back
without
it
and
throwing
a
swift
glance
round
him
took
the
young
girl
arm
and
walked
her
off
at
a
brisk
pace
to
the
woods
she
made
a
few
faint
protests
but
he
replied
you
and
i
have
something
to
say
to
each
other
little
girl
a
full
hour
had
elapsed
when
ephie
appeared
again
she
was
alone
and
walked
quickly
casting
shy
glances
from
side
to
side
on
reaching
the
conservatorium
she
waited
in
a
quiet
corner
of
the
vestibule
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
schilsky
sauntered
in
and
released
her
violin
from
the
keeping
of
the
janitor
a
good
friend
of
his
they
had
not
gone
far
into
the
wood
schilsky
knew
of
a
secluded
seat
which
was
screened
by
a
kind
of
boscage
and
here
they
had
remained
at
first
ephie
had
cried
heartily
in
happy
relief
and
he
had
not
been
able
to
console
her
he
had
come
to
meet
her
with
many
good
resolutions
determined
not
to
let
the
little
affair
so
lightly
begun
lead
to
serious
issues
but
ephie
tears
and
the
tale
they
told
and
the
sobbed
confessions
that
slipped
out
unawares
made
it
hard
for
him
to
be
wise
he
put
his
arm
round
her
dried
her
tears
with
his
own
handkerchief
kissed
the
hand
he
held
and
when
he
had
in
this
way
petted
her
back
to
composure
she
suddenly
looked
up
in
his
face
and
with
a
pretty
confiding
movement
said
then
you
do
care
for
me
a
little
it
would
have
need
a
stronger
than
he
to
answer
otherwise
of
course
i
do
was
easily
said
and
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
more
he
kissed
the
pink
dimples
at
the
base
of
her
four
fingers
as
well
as
the
baby
crease
that
marked
the
wrist
the
hat
lay
on
the
seat
beside
them
the
fluffy
head
and
full
white
throat
were
bare
in
the
mellow
light
of
the
trees
the
lashes
looked
on
her
cheeks
at
each
word
he
saw
her
small
even
teeth
and
he
was
so
unnerved
by
the
nearness
of
all
this
fresh
young
beauty
that
when
ephie
with
her
accustomed
frankness
had
told
him
everything
he
cared
to
know
he
found
himself
saying
in
place
of
what
he
had
intended
that
they
must
be
very
cautious
in
the
meantime
it
would
not
do
for
them
to
be
seen
together
it
might
injure
his
prospects
be
harmful
to
his
future
yes
but
afterwards
she
asked
him
promptly
he
kissed
her
cheek
but
she
repeated
the
question
and
he
was
obliged
to
reply
that
would
be
a
different
matter
it
was
now
her
turn
to
be
curious
and
one
of
the
first
questions
she
put
related
to
the
dark
girl
he
had
been
with
at
the
theatre
playing
lightly
with
her
fingers
schilsky
told
her
that
this
was
one
of
his
best
friends
some
one
he
had
known
for
a
long
long
time
to
whom
he
owed
much
and
whom
he
could
under
no
circumstances
offend
ephie
looked
grave
for
a
moment
and
in
the
desire
of
provoking
a
pretty
confession
he
asked
her
if
she
had
minded
very
much
seeing
him
with
some
one
else
but
she
made
him
wince
by
responding
with
perfect
candour
with
her
oh
no
quite
old
before
parting
they
arranged
the
date
of
the
next
meeting
and
a
beginning
once
made
they
saw
each
other
as
often
as
was
feasible
ephie
grew
wonderfully
apt
at
excuses
for
going
out
at
odd
times
and
for
prolonged
absences
sound
fictions
were
needed
to
satisfy
johanna
and
even
maurice
guest
was
made
to
act
as
dummy
he
had
taken
her
for
a
walk
or
they
had
been
together
to
see
madeleine
wade
and
by
these
means
and
also
by
occasionally
shirking
a
lesson
she
gained
a
good
deal
of
freedom
johanna
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
herself
being
untruthful
as
of
doubting
ephie
whom
she
had
never
known
to
tell
a
lie
and
if
she
did
sometimes
feel
jealous
of
all
the
new
claims
made
on
her
little
sister
attention
such
a
feeling
was
only
temporary
and
she
was
for
the
most
part
content
to
see
ephie
content
at
night
in
her
own
room
lying
wakeful
with
hot
cheeks
and
big
eyes
ephie
went
over
in
memory
all
that
had
taken
place
at
their
last
meeting
or
built
high
castles
for
the
future
she
was
absurdly
happy
and
her
mother
and
sister
had
never
found
her
more
charming
and
lovable
or
richer
in
those
trifling
inspirations
for
brightening
life
which
happiness
brings
with
it
she
looked
forward
with
secret
triumph
to
the
day
when
she
would
be
able
to
announce
her
engagement
to
the
celebrated
young
violinist
and
the
only
shadow
on
her
happiness
was
that
she
could
not
do
this
immediately
it
did
not
once
cross
her
mind
to
doubt
the
issue
she
had
always
had
her
way
and
in
her
own
mind
had
long
since
arranged
just
how
this
matter
was
to
fall
out
she
would
return
to
america
where
of
course
they
would
live
and
get
her
clothes
ready
and
then
he
would
come
and
they
would
be
married
a
big
wedding
with
descriptions
in
the
newspapers
they
would
have
a
big
house
and
he
would
play
at
concerts
as
she
had
once
heard
sarasate
play
in
new
york
and
every
one
would
stand
on
tiptoe
to
see
him
she
sat
proud
and
conspicuous
in
the
front
row
his
wife
that
is
his
wife
people
whispered
and
they
drew
respectfully
back
to
let
her
pass
as
in
a
very
becoming
dress
she
swept
into
the
little
room
behind
the
platform
which
she
alone
was
permitted
to
enter
one
day
at
this
time
there
was
a
violent
thunderstorm
towards
midday
the
eastern
sky
grew
black
with
clouds
which
for
hours
had
been
ominously
gathering
a
sudden
wind
rose
and
swept
the
dust
through
the
streets
the
thunder
rumbled
and
each
roll
came
nearer
when
after
a
prolonged
period
of
expectation
the
storm
finally
burst
there
was
a
universal
sigh
of
relief
the
afternoon
was
damply
refreshing
as
soon
as
the
rain
ceased
maurice
shut
his
piano
and
walked
at
a
brisk
pace
to
connewitz
his
head
bared
beneath
the
overhanging
branches
which
were
still
weighed
down
by
their
burden
of
drops
at
the
waldcafe
on
the
bank
of
the
river
in
a
thickly
grown
arbour
which
he
entered
to
drink
a
glass
of
beer
he
found
philadelphia
jensen
and
the
pale
little
american
fauvre
taking
coffee
the
lady
welcomed
him
with
a
large
outstretched
hand
in
the
effusively
hearty
manner
with
which
she
as
it
were
took
possession
of
people
and
towards
six
the
three
walked
back
through
the
woods
together
miss
jensen
resolute
of
bust
as
of
voice
slightly
ahead
of
her
companions
carrying
her
hat
in
her
hand
fauvre
dragging
behind
hitting
indolently
at
stones
and
shrubs
and
singing
scraps
of
melodies
to
himself
in
his
deep
baritone
miss
jensen
who
had
once
been
a
journalist
was
an
earnest
worker
for
woman
emancipation
and
having
now
successfully
mounted
her
hobby
spoke
with
a
eloquence
maurice
had
never
been
called
on
to
think
about
the
matter
and
listened
to
her
words
comparing
her
as
she
swept
along
to
a
ship
in
full
sail
she
was
just
asserting
that
the
ordinary
german
woman
was
little
more
than
means
to
an
end
the
end
being
the
when
his
attention
was
arrested
and
in
an
instant
jerked
far
away
from
miss
jensen
theories
as
they
reached
the
bend
of
a
path
a
sound
of
voices
came
to
them
through
the
trees
and
on
turning
a
corner
maurice
caught
a
glimpse
of
two
people
who
were
going
in
the
opposite
direction
down
a
a
passing
but
vivid
glimpse
of
a
light
flowered
dress
of
a
grey
suit
of
clothes
and
auburn
hair
ephie
he
could
have
sworn
to
voice
and
dress
but
to
whom
in
all
the
world
was
she
talking
so
confidentially
at
the
name
that
rose
to
his
lips
he
almost
stopped
short
but
the
next
moment
he
was
afraid
lest
his
companions
should
also
have
seen
who
it
was
and
quickening
his
steps
he
incited
miss
jensen
to
talk
on
first
however
that
lady
said
in
a
surprised
tone
say
that
was
schilsky
was
it
who
was
the
lady
did
you
perceive
so
there
was
no
possible
doubt
of
it
after
parting
from
his
companions
he
did
an
errand
in
the
town
and
from
there
went
to
the
cayhills
pension
determined
to
ascertain
whether
it
had
really
been
ephie
he
had
seen
and
if
so
what
the
meaning
of
it
was
cayhill
and
johanna
were
in
the
johanna
looked
very
surprised
to
see
him
they
had
this
moment
risen
from
the
she
told
him
ephie
had
only
just
got
home
in
time
before
anything
further
could
be
said
ephie
herself
came
into
the
room
her
face
was
flushed
and
she
did
not
seem
at
his
unexpected
visit
she
hardly
greeted
him
and
instead
commenced
talking
about
the
weather
then
you
had
a
pleasant
walk
asked
johanna
in
a
preoccupied
fashion
without
looking
up
from
the
letter
she
was
writing
and
before
maurice
could
speak
ephie
fondling
her
sister
neck
answered
how
could
it
be
anything
but
sweet
after
the
rain
in
the
face
of
this
frankness
it
was
on
maurice
tongue
to
say
then
it
was
you
i
saw
but
again
she
did
not
give
him
time
still
standing
behind
johanna
chair
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
young
man
face
with
a
curious
intentness
she
continued
we
walked
right
to
connewitz
and
back
without
a
rest
i
do
think
you
should
take
her
so
far
said
cayhill
looking
up
from
her
book
with
her
kindly
smile
she
has
never
been
used
to
walking
and
is
easily
tired
are
you
my
pet
yes
and
then
she
ca
get
up
the
next
morning
said
johanna
mildly
dogmatic
considering
the
following
sentence
of
her
letter
gradually
it
broke
upon
maurice
that
ephie
had
been
making
use
of
his
name
his
consternation
at
the
discovery
was
such
that
he
changed
colour
the
others
however
were
both
too
engrossed
to
notice
it
ephie
grew
scarlet
but
continued
to
rattle
on
covering
his
silence
well
perhaps
it
was
a
little
too
far
she
admitted
but
mummy
i
wo
have
you
say
i
not
strong
why
herr
becker
is
always
telling
me
how
full
my
tone
is
getting
yes
indeed
and
look
at
my
muscle
she
turned
back
the
loose
sleeve
of
her
blouse
baring
almost
the
whole
of
her
rounded
arm
then
folding
it
sharply
to
her
she
invited
one
after
another
to
test
its
firmness
quite
a
i
declare
laughed
cayhill
at
the
same
time
drawing
her
little
daughter
to
her
to
kiss
her
but
johanna
frowned
and
told
ephie
to
put
down
her
sleeve
at
once
there
was
something
in
the
childish
action
that
offended
the
elder
sister
she
did
not
know
why
but
maurice
had
first
to
lay
two
of
his
fingers
on
the
soft
skin
and
then
to
help
her
to
button
the
cuff
when
soon
after
this
he
took
his
leave
ephie
went
out
of
the
room
with
him
in
the
dark
passage
she
caught
at
his
hand
morry
you
must
tell
tales
on
me
she
whispered
and
added
pettishly
why
ever
did
you
just
come
he
tried
to
see
her
face
what
is
it
all
about
ephie
he
asked
then
it
was
you
i
saw
in
the
nonne
by
the
weir
me
in
the
nonne
she
was
genuinely
surprised
you
saw
me
he
nodded
by
the
light
that
came
from
the
stairs
as
she
opened
the
she
noticed
that
he
looked
troubled
and
an
impulse
rose
in
her
to
throw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
say
yes
yes
it
was
me
oh
morry
i
am
so
happy
but
she
remembered
the
reasons
for
secrecy
that
had
been
imposed
on
her
and
at
the
same
time
felt
somewhat
defiantly
inclined
towards
maurice
after
all
what
business
was
it
of
his
why
should
he
take
her
to
task
for
what
she
chose
to
do
and
so
she
merely
laughed
with
assumed
merriment
her
own
charming
assuaging
laugh
in
the
wood
you
old
goose
listen
morry
i
told
them
i
had
been
with
you
because
why
because
one
of
the
girls
in
my
class
asked
me
to
go
to
the
cafe
francais
with
her
and
we
stayed
too
long
and
ate
too
much
and
joan
does
like
it
and
i
knew
she
would
be
cross
that
all
do
look
so
glum
you
silly
it
nothing
and
she
laughed
again
as
long
as
this
laugh
rang
in
his
ears
to
the
bottom
of
the
street
that
is
he
believed
her
then
the
evidence
of
his
senses
reasserted
itself
and
he
knew
that
what
she
had
told
him
was
false
he
had
heard
her
voice
in
the
wood
too
distinctly
to
allow
of
any
mistake
and
she
was
still
wearing
the
same
dress
besides
she
had
lied
so
artlessly
to
the
others
without
a
tremor
of
her
candid
eyes
why
should
she
not
lie
to
him
too
she
was
less
likely
to
be
considerate
of
him
than
of
johanna
but
his
distress
at
her
skill
in
deceit
was
so
great
that
he
said
ephie
little
ephie
aloud
to
himself
just
as
he
might
have
done
had
he
heard
that
she
was
stricken
down
by
a
mortal
illness
on
the
top
of
this
however
came
less
selfish
feelings
what
was
almost
a
sense
of
guilt
took
possession
of
him
he
felt
as
if
in
some
way
he
were
to
blame
for
what
had
happened
as
if
nature
had
intended
him
to
stand
in
the
place
of
a
brother
to
this
pretty
thoughtless
child
and
yet
what
could
he
have
done
he
did
not
now
see
ephie
as
often
as
formerly
and
hardly
ever
alone
on
looking
back
he
began
to
suspect
that
she
had
purposely
avoided
him
the
exercises
in
harmony
which
had
previously
brought
them
together
had
been
discontinued
first
she
had
said
that
her
teacher
was
satisfied
with
what
she
herself
could
do
then
that
he
had
advised
her
to
give
up
harmony
altogether
she
would
never
make
anything
of
it
in
the
light
of
what
had
come
to
pass
maurice
saw
that
he
had
let
himself
be
duped
by
her
she
had
lied
then
as
now
he
puzzled
his
brains
to
imagine
how
she
had
learned
to
know
schilsky
in
the
first
instance
and
when
the
affair
had
begun
what
he
had
overheard
that
afternoon
implied
an
advanced
stage
of
intimacy
and
he
revolved
measures
by
means
of
which
a
stop
might
be
put
to
it
the
only
course
he
could
think
of
was
to
lay
the
matter
before
johanna
and
yet
what
would
the
use
of
that
be
ephie
would
deny
everything
make
his
story
ludicrous
himself
impossible
and
never
forgive
him
into
the
bargain
in
the
end
he
might
do
more
good
by
watching
over
her
silently
at
a
distance
if
it
had
only
not
been
schilsky
who
was
concerned
some
of
the
ugly
stories
he
had
heard
related
of
the
young
man
rose
up
and
took
vivid
shape
before
his
eyes
if
any
harm
came
to
ephie
he
alone
would
be
to
blame
for
it
not
johanna
only
he
knew
the
frivolous
temptations
the
young
girl
was
exposed
to
why
in
name
had
he
not
taken
both
her
hands
as
they
stood
in
the
passage
and
insisted
on
her
confessing
to
him
no
credulous
as
usual
he
had
once
more
allowed
himself
to
be
hoodwinked
and
put
off
thus
he
fretted
without
arriving
at
any
clearer
conclusion
than
this
that
he
had
unwittingly
been
made
accessory
to
an
unpleasant
secret
but
where
his
mind
baulked
and
refused
to
work
was
when
he
tried
to
understand
what
all
this
might
mean
to
the
third
person
involved
did
louise
know
or
suspect
anything
had
she
perhaps
for
weeks
past
been
suffering
under
the
knowledge
he
stood
irresolute
at
the
crossing
where
the
mozartstrasse
joined
the
promenade
a
was
beginning
his
rounds
he
came
up
with
his
long
pole
to
the
lamp
at
the
corner
and
with
a
mild
explosion
the
little
flame
sprang
into
life
maurice
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
to
see
madeleine
the
latter
was
making
her
supper
of
tea
bread
and
cold
sausage
and
when
she
heard
that
he
had
not
eaten
she
set
a
cup
and
plate
before
him
and
was
glad
that
she
happened
to
be
late
propped
open
on
the
table
was
a
danish
grammar
which
she
conned
as
she
ate
for
in
the
coming
holidays
she
was
engaged
to
go
to
norway
as
guide
and
to
a
party
of
englishwomen
i
had
a
letter
from
london
she
said
with
definite
arrangements
so
i
at
once
bought
this
book
i
intend
to
try
and
master
at
least
the
rudiments
of
the
language
barbarous
though
it
is
for
i
want
to
get
some
good
from
the
journey
and
if
one
has
one
wits
about
one
much
can
be
learnt
from
and
she
traced
on
a
map
with
her
forefinger
the
route
they
proposed
to
follow
and
laughed
at
the
idea
of
the
responsibility
lying
heavy
on
her
but
when
they
had
finished
their
supper
and
she
had
talked
informingly
for
a
time
of
norway
its
people
and
customs
she
looked
at
the
young
man
who
sat
irresponsive
and
preoccupied
and
considered
him
attentively
is
anything
the
matter
or
are
you
only
tired
he
was
tired
but
though
she
herself
had
suggested
it
she
was
not
satisfied
with
his
answer
something
has
bothered
you
has
your
work
gone
badly
no
it
was
nothing
of
that
sort
but
madeleine
persisted
could
she
be
of
any
help
to
him
the
merest
trifle
not
worth
talking
about
the
twilight
had
grown
thick
around
them
the
furniture
of
the
room
lost
its
form
and
stood
about
in
shapeless
masses
through
the
open
window
was
heard
the
whistle
of
a
distant
train
a
large
fly
that
had
been
disturbed
buzzed
distractingly
undecided
where
to
for
the
night
it
was
sultry
again
after
the
rain
look
here
maurice
madeleine
said
when
she
had
observed
him
for
some
time
in
silence
i
do
want
to
be
officious
but
something
i
should
like
to
say
to
you
it
this
you
are
far
too
if
you
want
to
get
on
in
life
you
must
think
more
about
yourself
than
you
do
the
battle
is
to
the
strong
you
know
and
the
strong
within
limits
are
certainly
the
selfish
let
other
people
look
after
themselves
try
not
to
mind
how
foolish
they
are
you
improve
them
it
harder
i
daresay
than
it
is
to
be
a
person
of
unlimited
sympathies
it
harder
to
pass
the
maimed
and
crippled
by
than
to
stop
and
weep
over
them
and
feel
their
sufferings
through
yourself
but
you
have
really
something
in
you
to
occupy
yourself
with
you
not
one
of
those
people
i
wo
mention
names
whose
own
emptiness
forces
them
to
take
an
intense
interest
in
the
doings
of
others
and
who
the
moment
they
are
alone
with
their
thoughts
are
bored
to
desperation
just
as
there
are
people
who
have
no
talent
for
making
a
home
and
are
only
happy
when
they
are
out
of
it
here
she
laughed
at
her
own
seriousness
but
you
are
smiling
inwardly
and
thinking
the
real
old
you
do
practise
what
you
preach
madeleine
besides
mistaken
at
heart
i
a
veritable
egoist
she
contradicted
him
i
know
you
better
than
you
know
yourself
he
did
not
reply
and
a
silence
fell
in
which
the
commonplace
words
she
had
last
said
went
on
sounding
and
resounding
until
they
had
no
more
likeness
to
themselves
madeleine
rose
and
pushed
back
her
chair
with
a
grating
noise
i
must
light
the
lamp
sitting
in
the
dark
makes
for
foolishness
come
wake
up
and
tell
me
what
plans
you
have
for
the
holidays
if
i
had
a
sister
i
should
like
her
to
be
like
you
said
maurice
watching
her
busy
with
the
lamp
and
helpful
to
a
fellow
i
suppose
men
always
will
continue
to
consider
that
the
greatest
compliment
they
can
pay
said
madeleine
and
turned
up
the
light
so
high
that
they
both
and
then
she
scolded
the
young
man
soundly
for
his
intention
of
remaining
in
leipzig
during
the
holidays
but
when
he
rose
to
go
she
said
with
an
impulsiveness
that
was
foreign
to
her
i
wish
you
had
a
friend
it
was
his
turn
to
smile
have
you
had
enough
of
me
madeleine
who
was
sitting
with
crossed
arms
remained
grave
i
mean
a
man
some
one
older
than
yourself
and
who
has
had
experience
the
woman
in
the
world
does
count
only
a
very
few
days
later
an
occasion
offered
when
with
profit
to
himself
he
might
have
acted
upon
madeleine
introductory
advice
he
had
been
for
a
quick
solitary
walk
and
was
returning
in
the
evening
between
nine
and
ten
along
one
of
the
paths
of
the
wood
when
suddenly
and
close
at
hand
he
heard
the
sound
of
voices
he
stopped
instantaneously
for
by
the
jump
his
heart
gave
he
knew
that
louise
was
one
of
the
speakers
what
she
said
was
inaudible
to
him
but
it
was
enough
to
be
able
to
listen
unseen
to
her
voice
hearing
it
like
this
as
something
existing
for
itself
he
was
amazed
at
its
depth
and
clearness
he
felt
that
her
personal
presence
had
until
now
hindered
him
from
appreciating
a
beautiful
but
immaterial
thing
at
its
true
worth
at
first
like
a
cadence
that
repeats
itself
its
tones
rose
and
fell
but
with
more
subtle
inflections
than
the
ordinary
voice
has
there
was
a
note
in
it
that
might
have
belonged
to
a
child
voice
another
more
primitive
that
betrayed
feeling
with
as
little
reserve
as
the
cry
of
an
animal
then
it
sank
and
went
on
in
a
monotone
like
a
hebrew
prayer
as
if
reiterating
things
worn
threadbare
by
repetition
and
already
said
too
often
gradually
it
died
away
in
the
surrounding
silence
there
was
no
response
but
a
gentle
rustling
of
the
leaves
overhead
it
began
anew
and
in
the
interval
seemed
to
have
gained
in
intensity
now
there
was
a
bitterness
in
it
which
when
it
swelled
made
it
give
out
a
tone
like
the
roughly
touched
strings
of
an
instrument
it
seemed
to
be
accusing
to
be
telling
of
unmerited
suffering
and
this
time
it
elicited
a
reply
but
a
casual
indifferent
one
which
might
have
related
to
the
weather
or
to
the
time
of
night
louise
gave
a
shrill
laugh
and
then
as
plainly
as
if
the
words
were
being
carved
in
stone
before
his
eyes
maurice
heard
her
say
you
have
never
given
me
a
moment
happiness
as
before
no
answer
was
returned
and
almost
immediately
his
ear
caught
a
muffled
sound
of
footsteps
at
the
same
moment
a
shook
the
there
was
a
general
fluttering
and
swaying
around
him
and
he
came
back
to
himself
to
find
that
he
was
standing
rigid
holding
on
to
a
slender
tree
that
grew
close
by
the
path
his
first
conscious
thought
was
that
this
wind
meant
rain
there
would
be
another
storm
in
the
night
and
the
summer
holidays
time
of
partings
were
at
the
door
she
would
go
away
and
he
would
perhaps
never
see
her
again
since
the
evening
they
had
walked
home
from
the
theatre
together
he
had
had
no
further
chance
of
speaking
to
her
if
they
met
in
the
street
she
gave
him
as
madeleine
had
foretold
of
her
a
nod
and
a
smile
and
from
this
coolness
he
had
drawn
the
foolish
inference
that
she
wished
to
avoid
him
abnormally
sensitive
he
shrank
out
of
her
way
but
now
the
mad
sympathy
that
had
permeated
him
on
the
night
she
had
made
him
her
confidant
grew
up
in
him
again
it
swelled
out
into
something
monstrous
a
gigantic
pity
that
rebounded
on
himself
for
he
knew
now
why
she
suffered
and
he
was
cast
down
both
for
her
and
for
himself
it
seemed
unnatural
that
he
was
debarred
from
giving
her
just
a
fraction
of
the
happiness
she
craved
he
who
had
there
been
the
least
need
for
it
would
have
lain
himself
down
for
her
to
tread
on
and
in
some
of
the
subsequent
nights
when
he
could
not
sleep
he
composed
fantastic
letters
to
her
in
which
he
told
her
this
and
more
only
to
colour
guiltily
with
the
return
of
daylight
at
the
impertinent
folly
of
his
thoughts
but
he
could
not
forget
the
words
he
had
heard
her
say
they
haunted
him
like
an
importunate
refrain
even
his
busiest
hours
were
set
to
them
you
have
never
given
me
a
moment
happiness
and
they
were
alike
a
torture
and
a
joy
xii
the
second
half
of
july
scattered
the
little
circle
in
all
directions
maurice
spent
a
couple
of
days
at
the
different
seeing
his
friends
off
one
after
another
they
passed
into
that
anticipatory
mood
which
makes
an
egoist
of
the
prospective
traveller
his
thoughts
start
as
it
were
in
advance
he
has
none
left
for
the
people
who
are
remaining
behind
and
receives
their
care
and
attention
as
his
due
dove
was
packed
and
strapped
ready
to
set
out
an
hour
after
he
had
had
his
last
lesson
and
while
he
printed
labels
for
his
luggage
and
took
a
circumstantial
leave
of
his
landlady
and
her
family
with
whom
he
was
a
prime
favourite
by
reason
of
his
decent
and
orderly
habits
maurice
fetched
for
him
from
the
lending
library
the
pieces
of
music
set
by
schwarz
as
a
holiday
task
dove
was
on
tenterhooks
to
be
off
of
late
things
had
gone
superlatively
well
with
him
he
had
performed
with
applause
in
an
abendunterhaltung
and
been
highly
commended
by
schwarz
while
as
for
ephie
she
had
been
so
sweet
and
winning
so
modestly
encouraging
of
his
suit
that
he
had
every
reason
to
hope
for
success
in
this
quarter
also
too
dutiful
a
son
however
to
take
unauthorised
such
an
important
step
as
that
of
proposing
marriage
he
was
now
travelling
home
to
sound
two
elderly
people
resident
in
a
side
street
in
peterborough
on
the
advisability
of
an
american
the
cayhills
had
been
among
the
first
to
leave
and
would
be
absent
till
the
middle
of
september
one
afternoon
maurice
started
them
from
the
thuringer
bahnhof
on
their
journey
to
switzerland
having
seen
cayhill
comfortably
settled
with
her
bags
books
and
cushions
in
the
corner
of
a
carriage
and
given
johanna
assistance
with
the
tickets
he
stood
till
the
train
went
talking
to
ephie
and
he
long
retained
a
picture
of
her
standing
with
one
foot
on
the
step
in
a
becoming
a
hat
with
a
veil
flying
from
it
and
a
small
slung
across
her
shoulder
laughing
and
dimpling
and
well
aware
of
the
admiring
glances
that
were
cast
at
her
it
was
a
relief
to
maurice
that
she
was
going
away
for
a
time
his
feeling
of
responsibility
with
regard
to
her
had
not
flagged
and
he
had
made
a
point
of
seeing
her
more
often
and
of
knowing
more
of
her
movements
than
before
as
however
he
had
not
observed
anything
further
to
disturb
him
his
suspicions
were
on
the
verge
of
subsiding
as
suspicions
have
a
way
of
doing
when
we
wish
them
to
and
in
the
last
day
or
two
he
had
begun
to
feel
much
less
sure
and
to
wonder
if
after
all
he
had
not
been
mistaken
i
shall
miss
you
morry
i
almost
wish
i
were
not
going
said
ephie
and
this
was
not
untrue
in
spite
of
the
pretty
new
dresses
her
trunks
contained
say
i
do
believe
i
shall
enjoy
myself
one
bit
you
will
write
morry
wo
you
and
tell
me
what
goes
on
all
the
news
you
hear
and
who
you
see
and
everything
be
sure
you
write
said
madeleine
too
when
he
saw
her
off
early
in
the
morning
to
berlin
where
she
was
to
meet
her
english
charges
christiania
poste
restante
till
the
first
and
then
bergen
wade
do
forget
the
train
started
her
handkerchief
fluttered
from
the
window
until
the
carriage
was
out
of
sight
maurice
was
alone
every
one
he
knew
disappeared
even
furst
who
had
obtained
a
holiday
engagement
in
a
villa
near
dresden
an
odd
stillness
reigned
in
the
braustrasse
and
its
neighbourhood
from
houses
which
had
hitherto
been
clangrous
with
musical
noises
not
a
sound
issued
familiar
rooms
and
lodgings
were
either
closely
shuttered
or
in
process
of
scouring
hung
out
their
curtains
to
flutter
on
the
sill
the
days
passed
unmarked
eventless
like
the
uniform
pages
of
a
dull
book
when
the
solitude
grew
unbearable
maurice
went
to
visit
frau
furst
and
had
his
supper
with
the
family
he
was
a
welcome
guest
for
he
not
only
paid
for
all
the
beer
that
was
drunk
but
also
brought
such
a
generous
portion
of
sausage
for
his
own
supper
that
it
supplied
one
or
other
of
the
little
girls
as
well
afterwards
they
sat
round
the
listening
the
children
with
the
solemnity
that
characterised
them
to
frau
furst
reminiscences
otherwise
he
hardly
exchanged
a
word
with
anyone
but
sat
at
his
piano
the
livelong
day
of
late
schwarz
had
been
somewhat
cool
and
in
manner
with
him
the
master
had
also
not
displayed
the
same
detailed
interest
in
his
plans
for
the
summer
as
in
those
of
the
rest
of
the
class
this
was
one
reason
why
he
had
not
gone
away
like
every
one
else
the
other
that
he
had
been
unwilling
to
write
home
for
an
increase
of
allowance
sometimes
when
the
day
was
hot
he
envied
his
friends
refreshing
themselves
by
wood
mountain
or
sea
but
in
the
main
he
worked
briskly
at
czerny
fingerfertigkeit
and
with
such
perseverance
that
ultimately
his
fingers
stumbled
from
fatigue
with
the
beginning
of
august
the
heat
grew
oppressive
all
day
long
the
sun
beat
fierce
and
unremittent
on
this
city
of
the
plains
and
the
baked
pavements
were
warm
to
the
feet
business
slackened
and
the
midday
rest
in
shops
and
offices
was
extended
beyond
its
usual
limit
conservatorium
and
gewandhaus
at
first
given
over
to
relays
of
charwomen
their
brooms
and
buckets
soon
lay
dead
and
deserted
too
and
if
in
the
evening
maurice
passed
the
former
building
he
would
see
the
janitor
sitting
at
leisure
in
the
middle
of
the
pavement
smoking
his
long
black
cigar
the
old
trees
in
the
promenade
and
the
young
striplings
that
followed
the
river
in
the
lampestrasse
drooped
their
brown
leaves
thick
with
dust
the
familiar
smell
of
roasting
coffee
which
haunted
most
and
was
intensified
and
out
of
drains
and
rivers
rose
nauseous
and
penetrating
odours
from
which
there
was
no
escape
every
three
or
four
days
when
the
atmosphere
of
the
town
had
reached
a
pitch
of
unsavouriness
which
it
seemed
impossible
to
surpass
sudden
storms
swept
up
tropical
in
their
violence
blasts
of
thunder
cracked
like
splitting
beams
lightning
darted
along
the
narrow
streets
rain
fell
in
white
sizzling
sheets
but
the
morning
after
it
was
as
hot
as
ever
maurice
grew
so
accustomed
to
meet
no
one
he
knew
that
one
afternoon
towards
the
middle
of
august
he
was
pulled
up
by
a
jerk
of
surprise
in
front
of
the
pleissenburg
on
stumbling
across
heinrich
krafft
he
had
stopped
and
impulsively
greeted
the
young
man
before
he
recalled
his
previous
antipathy
to
him
krafft
was
sauntering
along
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
on
being
accosted
he
looked
vaguely
and
somewhat
moodily
at
maurice
the
next
moment
however
he
laid
a
hand
on
the
lappel
of
maurice
coat
and
without
preamble
burst
into
a
witty
and
obscene
anecdote
which
had
evidently
been
in
his
mind
when
they
met
this
story
and
the
fact
that
by
the
north
sea
he
had
stood
before
breakers
twenty
feet
high
were
the
only
particulars
maurice
bore
away
from
their
interview
his
previous
impatience
with
such
eccentricity
returned
but
none
the
less
he
looked
grudgingly
after
the
other
vanishing
form
a
day
or
two
later
towards
evening
he
saw
krafft
again
as
he
was
going
through
an
outlying
street
he
came
upon
a
group
of
children
who
were
amusing
themselves
by
teasing
a
cat
the
animal
had
been
hit
in
the
eye
by
a
stone
and
cowered
terrified
and
blinded
against
the
wall
of
a
house
the
children
formed
a
half
circle
round
it
and
two
of
the
biggest
boys
held
a
young
and
lively
dog
by
the
collar
inciting
it
and
restraining
it
and
revelling
in
the
cat
convulsive
starts
at
each
capering
bark
while
maurice
was
considering
how
to
expostulate
with
them
krafft
came
swiftly
up
behind
jerked
two
of
the
children
apart
and
with
a
deft
and
perfectly
noiseless
movement
caught
up
the
cat
and
hid
its
head
under
his
coat
then
cuffing
the
biggest
boy
he
kicked
the
dog
and
ordered
the
rest
to
disperse
the
children
did
so
lingeringly
and
once
out
of
his
reach
stood
and
mocked
him
he
begged
maurice
to
accompany
him
to
his
lodgings
and
there
maurice
held
the
animal
a
large
while
krafft
on
his
knees
before
it
examined
the
wound
as
he
did
this
he
crooned
in
a
wordless
language
and
the
cat
was
quiet
in
spite
of
the
pain
he
caused
it
but
directly
he
took
his
hands
off
it
it
jumped
from
the
table
and
fled
under
the
furthest
corner
of
the
sofa
krafft
next
fetched
milk
and
a
saucer
from
a
cupboard
in
the
wall
and
went
down
on
his
knees
again
while
maurice
sat
and
watched
and
wondered
at
his
tireless
endeavours
to
induce
the
animal
to
advance
he
explained
his
proceedings
in
a
whisper
if
i
put
the
saucer
down
and
leave
it
he
said
it
wo
help
at
all
a
cat
confidence
must
be
won
straight
away
he
was
still
in
this
position
making
persuasive
little
noises
when
the
door
opened
and
avery
hill
his
companion
of
a
previous
occasion
entered
at
the
sight
of
krafft
crouching
on
the
floor
she
paused
with
her
hand
on
the
door
and
looked
from
him
to
maurice
heinz
she
said
interrogatively
then
she
saw
the
saucer
of
milk
and
understood
heinz
she
said
again
and
this
time
the
word
was
a
reprimand
ssh
be
quiet
said
krafft
peevishly
without
looking
up
the
girl
took
no
notice
of
maurice
attempt
to
greet
her
letting
fall
on
the
grand
piano
some
volumes
of
music
she
was
carrying
she
continued
sternly
another
cat
oh
it
is
abominable
of
you
this
is
the
third
he
has
picked
up
this
year
she
said
explanatorily
yet
not
more
to
maurice
than
to
herself
and
the
last
was
so
dirty
and
destructive
that
frau
schulz
threatened
to
turn
him
out
if
he
did
not
get
rid
of
it
he
knows
as
well
as
i
do
that
he
can
not
keep
a
cat
here
her
placidly
tragic
face
had
grown
hard
and
altogether
the
anger
she
displayed
seemed
out
of
proportion
to
the
trival
offence
krafft
remained
undisturbed
it
not
the
least
use
scolding
go
and
make
it
right
with
the
old
come
puss
come
the
girl
checked
the
words
that
rose
to
her
lips
gave
a
slight
shrug
and
went
out
of
the
room
they
heard
her
in
the
passage
disputing
with
the
landlady
who
was
justly
indignant
if
it
were
for
you
fraulein
i
would
keep
him
another
day
she
declared
meanwhile
the
cat
which
in
the
girl
presence
had
shrunk
still
further
into
its
began
to
make
advances
it
crept
a
step
forward
retreated
again
stretched
out
its
nose
to
sniff
at
the
milk
and
all
of
a
sudden
emerged
and
drank
greedily
krafft
touched
its
head
and
the
animal
paused
in
its
hungry
gulping
to
rub
its
back
against
the
caressing
hand
when
the
last
drop
of
milk
was
finished
it
withdrew
to
its
corner
but
less
suspiciously
krafft
rose
to
his
feet
and
stretched
himself
and
when
avery
returned
he
smiled
at
her
now
then
is
it
all
right
she
did
not
reply
but
went
to
the
piano
to
search
for
something
among
the
scattered
music
krafft
clasped
his
hands
behind
his
head
and
leaning
against
the
table
watched
her
with
an
ironical
curl
of
the
lip
o
lene
lene
o
magdalene
he
sang
under
his
breath
and
for
the
second
time
maurice
received
the
impression
that
a
was
being
carried
on
between
these
two
look
at
this
said
krafft
after
a
pause
here
ladies
and
gentlemen
is
one
of
those
rare
persons
who
have
a
jot
of
talent
in
them
and
off
she
goes
i
do
mean
at
this
moment
but
tomorrow
the
day
after
every
day
to
waste
it
in
teaching
children
if
you
ask
her
why
she
does
it
she
will
tell
you
it
is
necessary
to
live
necessary
to
live
who
has
ever
proved
that
it
is
for
an
instant
it
seemed
as
if
the
girl
were
going
to
flash
out
a
bitter
retort
that
might
have
betrayed
her
then
she
showed
the
same
as
before
and
went
without
a
word
into
the
next
room
she
was
absent
for
a
few
minutes
and
when
she
reappeared
carried
what
was
unmistakably
a
bundle
of
soiled
linen
going
away
with
this
on
one
arm
the
volumes
of
music
she
had
picked
out
on
the
other
she
did
not
wish
the
young
men
but
in
passing
maurice
she
said
in
an
unfriendly
tone
do
you
know
what
time
it
is
and
to
krafft
it
is
late
heiriz
you
are
not
to
play
the
door
had
barely
closed
behind
her
when
krafft
broke
into
the
loud
repellent
laugh
that
had
so
jarred
on
maurice
at
their
former
meeting
he
had
risen
at
once
and
now
said
he
must
go
but
krafft
would
not
hear
of
it
he
pressed
him
into
his
seat
again
with
an
effusive
warmth
of
manner
do
mind
her
stay
like
a
good
fellow
of
course
i
am
going
to
play
to
you
he
flicked
the
keys
of
the
piano
with
his
handkerchief
adjusted
the
distance
of
his
seat
threw
back
his
head
and
half
closing
his
eyes
began
to
play
except
for
the
unsteady
flickerings
cast
on
the
wall
by
a
the
room
was
soon
in
darkness
maurice
resumed
his
seat
reluctantly
he
had
been
dragged
upstairs
against
his
will
and
throughout
the
foregoing
scene
had
sat
an
uncomfortable
spectator
he
had
as
little
desire
for
the
girl
to
return
and
find
him
there
as
for
krafft
to
play
to
him
but
no
excuse
for
leaving
offered
itself
and
each
moment
made
it
harder
to
interrupt
the
player
who
had
promptly
forgotten
the
fact
of
his
presence
after
he
had
listened
for
a
time
however
maurice
ceased
to
think
of
escaping
madeleine
had
once
alluded
to
krafft
skill
as
an
interpreter
of
chopin
but
all
the
same
he
had
not
expected
anything
like
what
he
now
heard
and
at
first
he
could
not
make
anything
of
it
he
had
hitherto
only
known
chopin
music
as
played
in
the
sentimental
fashion
of
the
english
here
now
came
some
one
who
made
it
clear
that
no
matter
how
pessimistic
it
appeared
on
the
surface
this
music
was
at
its
core
an
essentially
masculine
music
it
kicked
desperately
against
the
pricks
of
existence
what
failed
it
was
only
the
last
philosophic
calm
he
could
not
of
course
know
that
various
small
things
had
combined
to
throw
the
player
into
one
of
his
most
prodigal
moods
the
rescue
and
taming
of
the
cat
the
with
avery
her
stimulating
forbiddal
and
last
and
best
the
one
silent
listener
in
the
dark
this
stranger
picked
up
at
random
in
the
streets
who
had
never
yet
heard
him
play
and
to
whom
he
might
reveal
himself
with
an
indecency
that
friendship
precluded
when
at
length
frau
schulz
entered
in
her
to
say
that
it
was
long
past
ten
krafft
wakened
as
if
out
of
a
trance
and
hid
his
eyes
from
the
light
frau
schulz
a
robust
person
disregarded
his
protests
and
herself
locked
the
piano
and
took
the
key
she
makes
me
promise
to
she
whispered
to
maurice
pointing
over
her
shoulder
at
an
imaginary
person
if
i
did
he
go
on
all
night
he
no
more
fit
to
look
after
himself
than
a
baby
and
he
gets
it
again
with
his
boots
in
the
yes
yes
call
me
names
if
it
pleases
you
names
do
kill
and
if
i
am
a
hag
you
a
rascal
that
what
you
are
the
way
you
treat
that
poor
good
creature
makes
one
blood
boil
krafft
waved
her
away
and
opening
the
window
leaned
out
on
the
sill
a
wave
of
warm
air
filled
the
room
maurice
rose
with
renewed
decision
and
sought
his
hat
but
krafft
also
took
his
down
from
a
peg
yes
let
us
go
out
it
was
a
breathless
august
night
laden
with
intensified
scents
and
smells
and
the
moonlight
lay
thick
and
white
on
the
ground
a
night
to
provoke
to
extravagant
follies
in
the
utter
stillness
of
the
woods
the
young
men
passed
from
places
of
inky
blackness
into
bluish
white
patches
dropped
through
the
trees
like
monstrous
silver
thalers
the
town
lay
behind
them
in
a
glorifying
haze
the
river
stretched
in
the
moonlight
like
a
gigantic
krafft
walked
in
front
of
his
companion
in
preoccupied
silence
his
slender
hands
dangling
loosely
still
twitched
from
their
recent
exertions
and
from
time
to
time
he
turned
the
palms
outward
with
an
impatient
gesture
maurice
wished
himself
alone
he
was
not
at
ease
under
this
new
companionship
that
had
thrust
itself
upon
him
indeed
a
strong
mental
antagonism
was
still
uppermost
in
him
towards
the
moody
creature
at
whose
heels
he
followed
and
if
at
this
moment
he
had
been
asked
to
give
voice
to
his
feelings
the
term
crazy
idiot
would
have
been
the
first
to
rise
to
his
lips
suddenly
without
turning
or
slackening
his
pace
krafft
commenced
to
speak
at
first
in
a
low
voice
as
if
he
were
thinking
aloud
but
one
word
gave
another
his
thoughts
came
rapidly
he
began
to
gesticulate
and
finally
wrought
on
by
the
beauty
of
the
night
by
this
choice
moment
for
speech
still
excited
by
his
own
playing
and
in
an
infinite
need
of
expression
he
swept
the
silence
before
him
with
the
force
of
a
flood
set
free
if
he
thought
maurice
were
about
to
interrupt
him
he
made
an
imploring
gesture
and
left
what
he
was
saying
unfinished
to
spring
over
to
the
next
theme
ready
in
his
brain
names
jostled
one
another
on
his
tongue
he
passed
from
beethoven
and
chopin
to
berlioz
and
wagner
to
liszt
and
richard
strauss
and
his
words
were
to
maurice
like
the
unrolling
of
a
great
scroll
in
the
same
breath
he
was
with
nietzsche
and
apollonic
and
dionysian
and
from
here
he
went
on
to
richard
dehmel
to
anatol
and
the
gentle
loris
of
the
early
verses
to
max
klinger
and
the
propriety
of
coloured
sculpture
to
papa
hamlet
and
the
future
of
the
lied
maurice
listening
intently
had
fleeting
glimpses
into
a
land
of
which
he
knew
nothing
he
kept
as
still
as
a
mouse
in
order
not
to
betray
his
ignorance
for
krafft
was
not
didactic
and
talked
as
if
the
subjects
he
touched
on
were
as
familiar
to
maurice
as
to
himself
on
the
other
hand
maurice
believed
it
was
a
matter
of
indifference
to
him
whether
he
was
understood
or
not
he
spoke
for
the
pure
joy
of
talking
out
of
the
motley
profusion
of
his
knowledge
meanwhile
he
had
grown
personal
and
while
he
was
still
speaking
with
fervour
of
vienna
which
was
his
home
of
gay
melancholy
wien
he
flung
round
and
put
a
question
to
his
companion
do
you
ever
think
of
death
maurice
had
been
the
listener
for
so
long
that
he
started
death
he
echoed
and
was
as
much
embarrassed
as
though
asked
whether
he
believed
in
god
i
do
know
no
i
do
think
i
do
why
should
one
think
of
death
when
one
is
alive
and
well
krafft
laughed
at
this
with
a
pitying
irony
happy
you
he
said
happy
you
his
voice
sank
and
he
continued
almost
fearfully
i
have
the
vision
of
it
before
me
always
wherever
i
go
listen
i
will
tell
you
it
is
like
this
he
laid
his
hand
on
maurice
arm
and
drew
him
nearer
i
know
no
matter
how
strong
and
sound
i
may
be
at
this
moment
no
matter
how
i
laugh
or
weep
or
play
the
fool
no
matter
how
little
thought
i
give
it
or
whether
i
think
about
it
all
day
long
i
know
the
hour
will
come
at
last
when
i
shall
gasp
choke
grow
black
in
the
face
in
the
vain
struggle
for
another
single
mouthful
of
that
air
which
has
always
been
mine
at
will
and
no
one
will
be
able
to
help
me
there
is
no
escape
from
that
hour
no
power
on
earth
can
keep
it
from
me
and
it
is
all
a
matter
of
chance
when
it
happens
a
great
lottery
one
draws
one
but
my
turn
will
surely
come
and
each
day
that
passes
brings
me
hours
nearer
the
end
he
drew
still
closer
to
maurice
tell
me
have
you
never
stood
before
a
doorway
the
doorway
of
some
strange
house
that
you
have
perhaps
never
consciously
gone
past
before
and
waited
with
the
atrocious
curiosity
that
death
and
its
hideous
paraphernalia
waken
in
one
for
a
coffin
to
be
carried
out
the
coffin
of
an
utter
stranger
who
is
of
interest
to
you
now
for
the
first
and
the
last
time
and
have
you
not
thought
to
yourself
with
a
shudder
that
some
day
in
this
selfsame
way
under
the
same
indifferent
sky
among
a
group
of
loiterers
as
idly
curious
as
these
you
yourself
will
be
carried
out
feet
foremost
like
a
bale
of
goods
like
useless
lumber
all
will
and
dignity
gone
from
you
never
to
enter
there
again
there
where
all
the
little
human
things
you
have
loved
and
used
and
lived
amongst
are
lying
just
as
you
left
them
the
book
you
laid
down
the
coat
you
wore
now
all
of
a
greater
worth
than
you
you
are
mere
dead
flesh
and
behind
the
horrid
lid
lie
stark
and
cold
with
rigid
fingers
and
eyes
and
the
chief
desire
of
every
one
even
of
those
you
have
loved
most
is
to
be
rid
of
you
to
be
out
of
reach
of
sight
and
smell
of
you
and
so
after
being
carted
and
jolted
and
unloaded
you
will
be
thrown
into
a
hole
and
your
body
and
as
yielding
as
meat
to
the
touch
oh
that
awful
icy
softness
your
flesh
will
begin
to
rot
to
be
such
that
not
your
nearest
friend
would
touch
you
god
it
is
unbearable
he
wiped
his
forehead
and
maurice
was
silent
not
knowing
what
to
say
he
felt
that
such
rational
arguments
as
he
might
be
able
to
offer
would
have
little
value
in
the
face
of
this
intensely
personal
view
which
was
stammered
forth
with
the
bitterness
of
an
accusation
but
as
they
crossed
the
suspension
bridge
krafft
stopped
and
stood
looking
at
the
water
which
glistened
in
the
moonlight
like
a
living
thing
no
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
put
death
out
of
my
mind
he
went
on
and
yet
a
spring
into
this
silver
fire
down
here
would
end
all
that
and
satisfy
one
curiosity
as
well
why
is
one
not
readier
to
make
the
spring
and
what
would
one
sensations
be
the
mad
rush
through
the
air
the
crash
the
sinking
in
the
awful
blackness
those
of
fear
and
cold
you
would
wish
yourself
out
again
answered
maurice
and
as
krafft
nodded
without
seeming
to
resent
his
tone
he
ventured
to
put
forward
a
few
points
for
the
other
side
of
the
question
he
suggested
that
always
to
be
brooding
over
death
unfitted
you
for
life
every
one
had
to
die
when
his
time
came
it
was
foolish
to
look
upon
your
own
death
as
an
exception
to
the
rule
besides
when
sensation
had
left
you
the
soul
the
spirit
whatever
you
liked
to
call
it
what
did
it
matter
what
afterwards
became
of
your
body
it
was
then
in
reality
nothing
but
lumber
fresh
nourishment
for
the
soil
and
it
was
morbid
to
care
so
much
how
it
was
treated
just
because
it
had
once
been
your
tenement
when
it
was
now
as
worthless
as
the
crab
empty
shell
he
stuttered
this
out
in
his
halting
german
then
paused
not
sure
how
his
companion
would
take
the
didactic
tone
he
had
fallen
into
but
krafft
had
turned
and
was
gazing
at
him
considering
him
attentively
for
the
first
time
when
maurice
ceased
to
speak
he
nodded
a
hasty
assent
yes
yes
it
is
quite
true
go
on
and
as
the
former
having
nothing
more
to
say
was
mute
he
added
you
are
like
some
one
i
once
knew
he
was
a
great
musician
i
saw
him
die
he
died
by
inches
it
lasted
for
months
he
could
neither
die
nor
live
why
do
you
brood
over
these
things
if
you
find
them
so
awful
are
you
not
afraid
your
nerves
will
go
through
with
you
and
make
you
do
something
foolish
asked
maurice
and
was
himself
astonished
at
his
boldness
of
course
i
am
my
life
is
a
perpetual
struggle
against
suicide
answered
krafft
in
the
distance
a
struck
a
quarter
to
twelve
and
it
was
on
maurice
tongue
to
suggest
that
they
should
move
homewards
when
with
one
of
his
unexpected
transitions
krafft
turned
to
him
and
said
in
a
low
voice
what
do
you
say
shall
you
and
i
be
friends
maurice
hesitated
in
some
embarrassment
why
yes
i
should
be
very
glad
and
you
will
let
me
say
to
you
certainly
if
you
are
sure
you
wo
regret
it
in
the
morning
krafft
stretched
out
his
hand
as
maurice
held
in
his
the
fine
slim
fingers
which
seemed
mere
skin
and
muscle
a
hitherto
unknown
feeling
of
kindliness
came
over
him
for
the
young
man
at
his
side
at
this
moment
he
had
the
lively
sensation
that
he
was
the
stronger
and
wiser
of
the
two
and
that
it
was
even
a
little
beneath
him
to
take
the
other
too
seriously
you
think
so
poorly
of
me
then
you
think
no
good
thing
can
come
out
of
me
asked
krafft
and
there
was
an
appealing
note
in
his
voice
which
but
a
short
time
back
had
been
so
overbearing
had
maurice
known
him
better
he
would
have
promptly
retorted
be
a
fool
as
it
was
he
laughed
who
am
i
to
sit
in
judgment
the
only
thing
i
do
know
is
that
if
i
had
your
talent
no
a
quarter
of
it
i
should
pull
myself
together
and
astonish
the
world
it
sounds
so
easy
but
i
have
too
many
doubts
of
myself
said
krafft
and
laid
his
hand
on
maurice
shoulder
and
i
have
never
had
anyone
to
keep
me
up
to
the
mark
till
now
i
have
always
needed
some
one
like
you
you
are
strong
and
sympathetic
and
one
has
the
feeling
that
you
understand
maurice
was
far
from
certain
that
he
did
however
he
answered
in
a
frank
way
doing
his
best
to
keep
down
the
sentimental
tone
that
had
invaded
the
conversation
at
heart
he
was
little
moved
by
this
new
friendship
which
hail
begun
with
the
word
itself
he
told
himself
that
it
was
only
a
whim
of
krafft
which
would
be
forgotten
in
the
morning
but
as
they
stood
thus
on
the
bridge
shoulder
to
shoulder
he
did
not
understand
how
he
could
ever
have
taken
anything
this
frail
creature
did
amiss
at
the
moment
there
was
a
clinging
helplessness
about
krafft
which
instinctively
roused
his
manlier
feelings
he
said
to
himself
that
he
had
done
wrong
in
lightly
condemning
his
companion
and
impelled
by
this
sudden
burst
of
protectiveness
he
seized
the
moment
and
spoke
earnestly
to
krafft
of
earnest
things
of
duty
not
only
to
one
fellows
but
to
oneself
and
one
abilities
of
the
inspiring
gain
of
unremitted
endeavour
afterwards
they
sauntered
home
first
to
maurice
lodging
then
to
krafft
and
once
again
to
maurice
at
this
stage
krafft
was
frankness
itself
maurice
learnt
to
his
surprise
that
the
slim
boyish
lad
at
his
side
was
over
years
of
age
that
for
several
semesters
krafft
had
studied
medicine
in
vienna
then
had
thrown
up
this
disgusting
occupation
to
become
a
clerk
in
a
wealthy
from
this
he
had
drifted
into
journalism
and
finally
at
the
instigation
of
hans
von
bullow
to
music
he
had
been
for
two
and
a
half
years
with
bullow
on
travel
and
in
hamburg
and
was
at
present
in
leipzig
solely
to
have
his
fingers
put
in
order
his
plans
for
the
future
were
many
and
widely
divergent
at
one
time
a
musical
career
tempted
him
irresistibly
every
one
but
schwarz
this
this
generator
of
living
metronomes
believed
that
he
could
make
a
name
for
himself
as
a
player
of
chopin
at
other
times
and
more
often
he
contemplated
retiring
from
the
world
and
entering
a
monastery
he
spoke
with
a
morbid
horror
yet
as
if
the
idea
of
it
fascinated
him
of
the
publicity
of
the
and
painted
in
glowing
colours
a
monastery
he
knew
of
standing
on
a
wooded
hill
not
far
from
vienna
he
had
once
spent
several
weeks
there
recovering
from
an
illness
and
the
gardens
the
trimly
bedded
flowers
the
glancing
sunlight
in
the
utter
silence
of
the
corridors
were
things
he
could
not
forget
he
had
lain
day
for
day
on
a
reading
novalis
and
it
still
seemed
to
him
that
the
wishless
happiness
of
those
days
was
the
greatest
he
had
known
beside
this
maurice
account
of
himself
sounded
tame
and
unimportant
he
felt
too
that
the
circumstances
of
english
life
were
too
far
removed
from
his
companion
sphere
for
the
latter
to
be
able
to
understand
them
on
waking
next
morning
maurice
recalled
the
incidents
of
the
evening
with
a
smile
felt
a
touch
of
warmth
at
the
remembrance
of
the
moment
when
he
had
held
krafft
hand
in
his
then
classed
the
whole
episode
as
strained
and
dismissed
it
from
his
mind
he
had
just
shut
the
piano
after
a
busy
forenoon
when
krafft
burst
in
his
cheeks
pink
with
haste
and
excitement
he
had
discovered
a
room
to
let
in
the
house
he
lived
in
and
nothing
would
satisfy
him
but
that
maurice
should
come
instantly
to
see
it
laughing
at
his
eagerness
maurice
put
forward
his
reasons
for
preferring
to
remain
where
he
was
but
krafft
would
take
no
denial
and
not
wishing
to
hurt
his
feelings
maurice
gave
way
and
agreed
at
least
to
look
at
the
room
it
was
larger
and
more
cheerful
than
his
own
and
had
also
a
convenient
alcove
for
the
bedstead
and
after
inspecting
it
maurice
felt
willing
to
expend
the
extra
marks
it
cost
they
withdrew
to
krafft
room
to
come
to
a
decision
there
however
they
found
avery
hill
who
as
soon
as
she
heard
what
they
contemplated
put
a
veto
on
it
growing
pale
as
she
always
did
where
others
would
have
flushed
she
said
it
is
an
absurd
idea
sheer
nonsense
i
wo
have
it
understand
that
pray
excuse
me
she
continued
to
maurice
speaking
in
a
more
friendly
tone
than
she
had
yet
used
to
him
but
you
must
not
listen
to
him
it
is
just
one
of
his
whims
nothing
more
in
less
than
a
week
you
would
wish
yourself
away
again
you
have
no
idea
how
changeable
he
is
how
impossible
to
live
with
maurice
hastened
to
reassure
her
krafft
did
not
speak
he
stood
at
the
window
with
his
back
to
them
his
forehead
pressed
against
the
glass
so
maurice
continued
to
live
in
the
braustrasse
under
the
despotic
rule
of
frau
krause
who
took
every
advantage
of
his
but
after
this
not
a
day
passed
without
his
seeing
krafft
the
latter
sought
him
out
on
trivial
pretexts
maurice
hardly
recognised
him
he
was
gentle
amiable
and
amenable
to
reason
he
subordinated
himself
entirely
to
maurice
and
laid
an
weight
on
his
opinion
maurice
became
able
to
wind
him
round
his
finger
and
the
hint
of
a
reproof
from
him
served
to
throw
krafft
into
a
state
of
nervous
depression
without
difficulty
maurice
found
himself
to
rights
in
his
role
of
mentor
and
began
to
flatter
himself
that
he
would
ultimately
make
of
krafft
a
decent
member
of
society
as
it
was
he
soon
induced
his
friend
to
study
in
a
more
methodical
way
they
practised
for
the
same
number
of
hours
in
the
forenoon
and
met
in
the
afternoon
and
krafft
only
sometimes
broke
through
this
arrangement
by
appearing
in
the
braustrasse
early
in
the
morning
and
despite
remonstrance
throwing
himself
on
the
sofa
and
remaining
there
while
maurice
practised
the
latter
ended
by
growing
accustomed
to
this
whim
as
to
several
other
things
that
had
jarred
on
him
such
as
krafft
love
for
a
dirty
jest
and
overlooked
or
forgave
them
at
first
embarrassed
by
the
mushroom
growth
of
a
friendship
he
had
not
invited
he
soon
grew
genuinely
attached
to
krafft
and
missed
him
when
he
was
absent
from
him
avery
hill
could
hardly
be
termed
third
in
the
alliance
advent
had
thrust
her
into
the
background
where
she
kept
watch
over
their
doings
with
her
cold
disdainful
eye
maurice
was
not
clear
how
she
regarded
his
intrusion
sometimes
particularly
when
she
saw
the
improvement
in
heinrich
way
of
life
she
seemed
to
tolerate
his
presence
gladly
at
others
again
her
jealous
aversion
to
him
was
too
open
to
be
overlooked
the
jealousy
was
natural
he
was
an
interloper
and
heinz
neglected
her
shamefully
for
him
but
there
was
something
else
behind
it
another
feeling
which
maurice
could
not
make
out
he
by
no
means
understood
the
relationship
that
existed
between
his
friend
and
this
girl
of
the
eyes
and
stern
red
lips
the
two
lived
almost
door
by
door
went
in
and
out
of
each
other
rooms
at
all
hours
and
yet
he
had
never
heard
them
exchange
an
affectionate
word
or
seen
a
mark
of
endearment
pass
between
them
avery
attachment
if
such
it
could
be
called
was
noticeable
only
in
the
many
small
ways
in
which
she
cared
for
krafft
comfort
her
manner
with
him
was
invariably
severe
and
distant
with
the
exception
of
those
occasions
when
a
seeming
trifle
raised
in
her
a
burst
of
the
dull
passionate
anger
beneath
which
krafft
shrank
maurice
believed
that
his
friend
would
be
happier
away
from
her
in
spite
of
her
fresh
colouring
he
maurice
found
her
wanting
in
attraction
nothing
that
a
woman
ought
to
be
but
her
name
was
rarely
mentioned
between
them
krafft
was
as
a
rule
reticent
concerning
her
and
when
he
did
speak
of
her
it
was
in
a
tone
of
such
contempt
that
maurice
was
glad
to
shirk
the
subject
it
all
she
wants
krafft
had
replied
when
his
companion
ventured
to
take
her
part
she
would
thank
you
to
be
treated
differently
believe
me
women
are
all
alike
they
are
made
to
be
trodden
on
brings
out
their
good
points
just
as
kneading
makes
dough
light
let
them
alone
or
pamper
them
and
they
spread
like
a
weed
and
choke
you
and
he
quoted
a
saying
about
going
to
women
and
not
forgetting
the
whip
at
which
maurice
stood
aghast
but
why
if
you
despise
a
person
like
that
why
have
her
always
about
you
he
cried
at
the
end
of
a
flaming
plea
for
woman
dignity
and
worth
krafft
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
suppose
the
truth
is
we
are
dependent
on
them
yes
dependent
from
the
moment
we
are
laid
in
the
cradle
it
a
woman
who
puts
on
our
first
clothes
and
a
woman
who
puts
on
our
last
but
why
talk
about
these
things
he
slipped
his
arm
through
maurice
tell
me
about
yourself
and
when
you
are
tired
of
talking
i
will
play
it
usually
ended
in
his
playing
they
ranged
through
the
highways
and
byways
of
music
one
afternoon
it
was
a
warm
wet
grey
day
towards
the
end
of
august
maurice
found
krafft
in
a
strangely
apathetic
mood
the
weather
this
moist
warmth
had
got
on
his
nerves
he
said
he
had
been
unable
to
settle
to
anything
was
weighed
down
by
a
lassitude
heavier
than
iron
when
maurice
entered
he
was
stretched
on
the
sofa
with
closed
eyes
on
his
chest
slept
wotan
the
cat
now
growing
sleek
and
fat
while
maurice
was
trying
to
rally
him
krafft
sprang
up
with
a
precipitance
that
was
the
extreme
opposite
of
his
previous
sloth
he
lowered
both
and
lighting
two
candles
set
them
on
the
piano
where
they
dispersed
the
immediate
darkness
but
no
more
i
am
going
to
play
tristan
to
you
maurice
had
learnt
by
this
time
that
it
was
useless
to
try
to
thwart
krafft
he
laughed
and
nodded
and
having
nothing
in
particular
to
do
lay
down
in
the
latter
place
on
the
sofa
krafft
shook
his
hair
back
and
began
the
prelude
to
the
opera
in
a
rapt
ecstatic
way
finding
in
the
music
an
outlet
for
all
his
nervousness
at
first
he
played
from
memory
when
this
gave
out
he
set
the
up
before
him
then
forgot
it
again
and
went
on
playing
by
heart
sometimes
he
sang
the
different
parts
in
a
light
sweet
tenor
sometimes
recited
them
with
dramatic
fervour
only
he
never
ceased
to
play
never
gave
his
hearer
a
moment
in
which
to
recover
himself
frau
schulz
entry
with
the
lamp
and
her
grumblings
at
the
unverschamte
spektakel
passed
unheeded
a
strength
that
was
more
than
human
seemed
to
take
possession
of
the
frail
youth
at
the
piano
evening
crept
on
afternoon
night
on
evening
and
still
he
continued
drunk
with
the
most
emotional
music
conceived
by
a
human
brain
even
when
hands
and
fingers
could
do
no
more
the
frenzy
that
was
in
him
would
not
let
him
rest
he
paced
the
room
and
talked
talked
for
hours
his
eyes
ablaze
a
struck
ten
then
then
eleven
and
not
for
a
moment
was
he
still
his
speech
seemed
indeed
to
gather
impetus
as
it
advanced
like
a
mountain
torrent
then
all
of
a
sudden
in
the
middle
of
a
vehement
defence
of
to
which
he
had
been
led
by
the
misdeeds
of
those
mendelssohn
and
meyerbeer
he
stopped
short
like
a
clock
and
falling
into
a
chair
before
the
table
buried
his
face
in
his
arms
there
was
silence
the
more
intense
for
all
that
had
preceded
it
wotan
wakened
from
sleep
and
was
heard
to
stretch
his
limbs
with
a
yawn
and
a
sigh
the
spell
was
broken
maurice
his
head
in
a
whirl
rose
stiff
and
cramped
from
his
uncomfortable
position
on
the
sofa
you
rascal
you
make
one
lose
all
sense
of
time
and
i
am
starving
i
must
snatch
something
at
canitz
as
i
go
by
krafft
started
and
raised
a
haggard
face
with
twitching
lips
you
are
not
going
to
leave
me
like
this
maurice
was
both
hungry
and
tired
worn
out
in
fact
we
will
go
somewhere
in
the
town
said
krafft
and
then
for
a
walk
the
rain
has
stopped
look
he
drew
up
one
of
the
blinds
and
they
saw
that
the
stars
were
shining
yes
but
what
about
and
work
may
never
come
and
is
those
are
only
words
do
you
know
the
time
krafft
turned
quickly
from
the
window
and
if
i
make
it
a
test
of
the
friendship
you
have
professed
for
me
that
you
stay
here
with
me
you
can
sleep
on
the
sofa
why
on
earth
get
personal
said
maurice
he
could
not
find
his
hat
which
had
fallen
in
a
dark
corner
heinz
dear
boy
be
reasonable
come
give
me
the
like
a
good
fellow
it
the
first
the
only
thing
i
have
asked
of
you
nonsense
you
have
asked
dozens
krafft
took
a
few
steps
towards
him
and
threw
the
key
on
the
floor
at
his
feet
wotan
who
was
at
the
door
mewing
to
be
let
out
sprang
back
in
affright
go
go
go
krafft
cried
i
never
want
to
see
you
again
earlier
than
usual
the
next
morning
maurice
returned
to
set
things
right
and
to
laugh
with
heinz
at
their
extravagance
the
night
before
but
krafft
was
not
to
be
seen
from
frau
schulz
who
flounced
past
him
in
the
passage
first
with
hot
water
then
with
black
coffee
maurice
learned
that
krafft
had
been
brought
home
early
that
morning
in
a
disgraceful
state
of
intoxication
frau
schulz
still
boiled
at
the
remembrance
so
schwein
so
schwein
she
cried
but
this
time
he
goes
i
have
said
it
before
and
fool
that
i
am
have
always
let
them
persuade
me
but
this
is
the
end
not
a
day
after
the
fifteenth
will
i
have
him
in
the
house
maurice
slipped
away
two
days
passed
before
he
saw
his
friend
again
he
found
him
pale
and
dejected
with
reddish
heavy
eyes
and
a
sneering
smile
he
was
wholly
changed
his
words
were
tainted
with
the
perverse
irony
which
at
the
beginning
of
their
acquaintance
had
made
his
manner
so
repellent
but
now
maurice
was
not
at
once
frightened
away
by
it
he
could
not
believe
heinrich
pique
was
serious
and
gave
himself
trouble
to
win
his
friend
back
he
chid
laughed
rallied
was
earnest
and
apologetic
and
all
this
without
being
conscious
of
having
done
wrong
i
think
you
had
better
leave
him
alone
said
avery
after
watching
his
fruitless
efforts
he
does
want
you
it
was
true
now
krafft
had
no
thought
for
anyone
but
avery
it
was
avery
here
and
avery
there
he
called
her
by
a
pet
name
was
anxious
for
her
comfort
and
hung
affectionately
on
her
the
worst
of
it
was
that
he
did
not
seem
in
the
least
ashamed
of
his
fickleness
maurice
made
one
further
attempt
to
move
him
then
hurt
and
angry
intruded
no
more
at
first
he
was
chiefly
angry
but
gradually
the
hurt
deepened
and
became
a
sense
of
injury
which
made
him
avoid
the
street
krafft
lived
in
and
shun
him
when
they
met
he
missed
him
after
the
close
companionship
of
the
past
weeks
and
felt
as
if
he
had
been
suddenly
deprived
of
a
part
of
himself
and
he
would
no
doubt
have
missed
him
more
keenly
still
if
just
at
this
juncture
his
attention
had
not
been
engrossed
by
another
and
more
important
matter
xiii
the
commencement
of
the
new
term
had
just
assembled
the
incoming
students
to
sign
their
names
in
the
venerable
rollbook
when
the
report
spread
that
schilsky
was
willing
to
play
his
symphonic
poem
zarathustra
to
those
of
his
friends
who
cared
to
hear
it
curiosity
swelled
the
number
and
furst
lent
his
house
for
the
occasion
you
come
of
course
said
the
latter
to
maurice
as
they
left
schwarz
room
after
their
lesson
and
madeleine
said
the
same
thing
while
driving
home
from
the
where
maurice
had
met
her
she
was
no
more
a
friend
of
schilsky
than
he
was
but
she
certainly
intended
to
be
present
to
hear
what
kind
of
stuff
he
had
turned
out
on
the
evening
of
the
performance
maurice
and
she
walked
together
to
the
brandvorwerkstrasse
madeleine
had
still
much
to
say
she
had
returned
from
her
holiday
in
the
best
of
health
and
spirits
liberally
rewarded
for
her
trouble
and
possessed
of
four
new
friends
who
no
doubt
would
all
be
of
use
to
her
when
she
settled
in
england
again
this
was
to
be
her
last
winter
in
leipzig
and
she
was
drawing
up
detailed
plans
of
work
from
now
on
she
intended
to
take
private
lessons
from
schwarz
in
addition
to
those
she
received
in
the
class
even
though
they
do
cost
ten
marks
each
it
makes
him
ever
so
much
better
disposed
towards
you
she
also
told
him
that
she
had
found
a
letter
from
louise
waiting
for
her
in
which
the
latter
announced
her
return
for
the
following
week
louise
wrote
from
england
and
all
her
cry
was
to
be
back
in
leipzig
of
course
now
he
is
here
commented
madeleine
you
know
i
suppose
that
he
has
been
travelling
with
zeppelin
he
has
the
luck
of
i
know
what
the
cayhills
would
be
absent
till
the
middle
of
the
month
maurice
had
received
from
ephie
one
widely
written
note
loud
in
praise
of
a
family
of
perfectly
sweet
americans
whom
they
had
learnt
to
know
in
interlaken
but
also
expressing
eagerness
to
be
at
home
again
in
dear
old
leipzig
dove
had
arrived
a
couple
of
days
ago
and
here
madeleine
laughed
he
is
absolutely
shiny
with
resolution
she
declared
mind
maurice
if
he
takes
you
into
confidence
as
he
probably
will
you
are
not
on
any
account
to
dissuade
him
from
proposing
a
snub
will
do
him
worlds
of
good
they
were
not
the
first
to
climb
the
stair
that
wound
up
to
the
fursts
dwelling
the
on
the
fourth
storey
stood
open
and
a
hum
of
voices
came
from
the
the
circular
in
the
passage
was
crowded
with
motley
headgear
as
they
passed
the
kitchen
the
door
of
which
was
ajar
frau
furst
peeped
through
the
slit
and
seeing
maurice
called
him
in
the
was
still
on
the
stove
he
must
sit
down
and
drink
a
cup
of
coffee
there
is
plenty
of
time
schilsky
has
not
come
yet
and
i
have
only
this
moment
sent
adolfchen
for
the
beer
maurice
asked
her
if
she
were
not
coming
in
to
hear
the
music
she
laughed
at
the
idea
bless
your
heart
what
should
i
do
in
there
among
all
you
young
people
no
no
i
can
hear
just
as
well
where
i
am
when
my
good
husband
had
his
evenings
it
was
always
from
the
kitchen
that
i
listened
pausing
with
a
saucepan
in
one
hand
a
cloth
in
the
other
she
said
you
will
hear
something
good
herr
guest
oh
he
has
talent
great
talent
has
young
schilsky
this
is
not
the
usual
work
of
a
pupil
it
has
form
and
it
has
ideas
and
it
is
new
and
daring
i
know
one
of
the
motives
from
hearing
franz
play
it
and
she
hummed
a
theme
as
she
replaced
on
the
shelf
the
scrupulously
cleaned
pot
for
such
a
young
man
it
is
wonderful
but
he
will
do
better
still
depend
upon
it
he
will
here
she
threw
a
hasty
glance
round
the
tiny
kitchen
at
three
of
the
children
sitting
as
still
as
mice
in
the
corner
laid
a
finger
on
her
lips
and
bursting
with
mystery
leaned
over
the
table
and
asked
maurice
if
he
could
keep
a
secret
he
is
going
away
she
whispered
maurice
stared
at
her
going
away
who
is
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
and
was
so
struck
by
her
peculiar
manner
that
he
set
his
cup
down
untouched
why
schilsky
of
course
she
thought
his
astonishment
was
disbelief
and
nodded
confirmingly
yes
yes
he
is
going
away
and
soon
too
how
do
you
know
cried
maurice
sitting
back
in
his
chair
he
stemmed
his
hands
against
the
edge
of
the
table
and
looked
challengingly
at
frau
furst
ssh
not
so
loud
said
the
latter
it
a
secret
a
dead
secret
though
i
sure
i
do
know
why
franz
at
this
very
moment
franz
himself
came
into
the
kitchen
he
looked
distrustfully
at
his
whispering
mother
now
then
mother
have
you
got
that
beer
yet
he
demanded
his
genial
bonhomie
disappeared
as
if
by
magic
when
he
entered
his
home
circle
and
he
was
particularly
gruff
with
this
adoring
woman
gleich
franzchen
gleich
she
answered
soothingly
and
whisked
about
her
work
again
with
the
air
of
one
caught
napping
maurice
followed
furst
invitation
to
join
the
rest
of
the
party
the
between
the
best
room
and
the
adjoining
bedroom
had
been
opened
wide
and
the
guests
were
distributed
over
the
two
rooms
the
former
was
brilliantly
lighted
by
three
lamps
and
two
candles
and
all
the
the
house
contained
was
ranged
in
a
semicircle
round
the
grand
piano
here
not
a
place
was
vacant
those
who
had
come
late
were
in
the
bedroom
making
shift
with
whatever
offered
two
girls
and
a
young
man
having
pushed
back
the
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
low
wooden
bedstead
with
their
arms
interlaced
to
give
them
a
better
balance
maurice
found
madeleine
on
a
rickety
little
sofa
that
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
dove
sat
on
a
chest
of
drawers
next
the
sofa
his
long
legs
dangling
in
the
air
beside
madeleine
with
his
head
on
her
shoulder
was
krafft
oh
there
you
are
cried
madeleine
well
i
did
my
best
to
keep
the
place
for
you
but
it
was
of
no
use
as
you
see
just
sit
down
however
between
us
we
squeeze
him
properly
maurice
was
glad
that
the
room
which
was
lighted
only
by
one
small
lamp
was
in
for
at
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
it
suddenly
became
clear
to
him
that
the
piece
of
gossip
frau
furst
had
volunteered
had
been
of
the
nature
of
a
blow
schilsky
departure
threatened
in
a
way
he
postponed
for
the
present
thinking
out
to
disturb
his
life
and
in
an
abrupt
need
of
sympathy
he
laid
his
hand
on
krafft
knee
is
it
you
old
man
what
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
krafft
gave
him
one
of
those
looks
which
in
the
early
days
of
their
acquaintance
had
proved
so
disconcerting
a
look
of
struggling
recollection
oh
nothing
in
particular
he
replied
without
hostility
but
also
without
warmth
his
mind
was
not
with
his
words
and
maurice
withdrew
his
hand
madeleine
leaned
forward
dislodging
krafft
head
from
its
how
long
have
you
two
been
to
each
other
she
asked
and
at
maurice
curt
reply
she
pushed
krafft
from
her
sit
up
and
behave
yourself
one
would
think
you
had
an
evil
spirit
in
you
krafft
was
nervously
excited
bright
red
spots
burnt
on
his
cheeks
his
hands
twitched
and
he
jerked
forward
in
his
seat
and
threw
himself
back
again
incessantly
no
you
are
worse
than
a
mosquito
cried
madeleine
losing
patience
anyone
would
think
you
were
going
to
play
yourself
and
he
will
be
as
cool
as
an
iceberg
the
sofa
wo
stand
it
heinz
if
you
ca
stop
fidgeting
get
up
he
had
gone
before
she
finished
speaking
for
a
slight
stir
in
the
next
room
made
them
suppose
for
a
moment
that
schilsky
was
arriving
afterwards
krafft
was
to
be
seen
straying
about
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
on
observing
his
cheeks
and
tumbled
curly
hair
madeleine
could
not
refrain
from
remarking
he
ought
to
have
been
a
girl
the
air
was
already
hot
by
reason
of
the
lamps
and
the
many
breaths
and
the
firmly
shut
the
clamour
for
beer
had
become
universal
by
the
time
adolfchen
arrived
with
his
arms
full
of
bottles
as
there
were
not
enough
glasses
to
go
round
every
two
or
three
persons
shared
one
between
them
a
proceeding
that
was
carried
out
with
much
noisy
mirth
above
all
other
voices
was
to
be
heard
that
of
miss
jensen
who
in
a
speckled
yellow
dress
with
a
large
feather
fan
in
her
hand
sat
in
the
middle
of
the
front
row
of
seats
it
was
she
who
directed
how
the
beer
should
be
apportioned
she
advised
a
few
where
they
would
still
find
room
and
engaged
furst
to
place
the
lights
on
the
piano
to
better
advantage
next
her
a
lautenschlager
a
plump
little
american
lady
with
straight
yellow
hair
which
hung
down
on
her
shoulders
was
relating
to
her
neighbour
on
the
other
side
in
a
tone
that
could
be
clearly
heard
in
both
rooms
how
she
had
discovered
her
voice
i
come
to
schwarz
last
fall
she
said
shaking
back
her
hair
and
making
effective
use
of
her
babyish
mouth
and
he
thinks
no
end
of
me
but
the
other
week
i
was
sick
and
as
i
lay
in
bed
i
sung
some
just
for
fun
and
my
landlady
she
a
regular
singer
herself
who
was
fixing
up
the
room
she
claps
her
hands
together
and
says
goodness
me
why
you
have
a
voice
that
what
put
it
in
my
head
and
i
went
to
sperling
to
hear
what
he
got
to
say
he
was
just
tickled
to
death
i
guess
he
was
and
he
going
to
make
something
dandy
of
it
so
i
stop
long
enough
i
do
know
what
my
husband
say
though
when
i
wrote
him
i
was
sick
he
says
home
and
be
sick
at
home
that
what
he
says
miss
jensen
could
not
let
pass
the
opportunity
of
breaking
a
lance
for
her
own
master
the
swede
and
of
cutting
up
sperling
method
which
she
denounced
as
antiquated
she
made
quite
a
little
speech
in
the
course
of
which
she
now
and
then
interrupted
herself
to
remind
furst
who
was
as
soft
as
a
pudding
before
her
of
something
he
had
forgotten
to
do
such
as
snuffing
the
candles
or
closing
the
door
just
let
me
hear
your
scale
will
you
she
said
patronisingly
to
lautenschlager
the
latter
nothing
loath
stuck
out
her
chin
opened
her
mouth
and
for
a
short
time
all
other
noises
were
drowned
in
a
fine
full
volume
of
voice
on
their
sofa
madeleine
and
maurlee
sat
in
silence
pretending
to
listen
to
dove
who
was
narrating
his
journey
madeleine
was
out
of
humour
she
tapped
the
floor
and
had
a
crease
in
her
forehead
as
for
maurice
he
was
in
such
poor
spirits
that
she
could
not
but
observe
it
why
are
you
so
quiet
is
anything
the
matter
he
shook
his
head
without
speaking
his
vague
sense
of
impending
misfortune
had
crystallised
into
a
definite
thought
he
knew
now
what
it
signified
if
schilsky
went
away
from
leipzig
louise
would
probably
go
too
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
everything
i
represented
to
him
he
heard
dove
saying
that
i
had
seen
the
luggage
with
my
own
eyes
at
flushing
what
do
you
think
he
answered
he
looked
me
up
and
down
and
said
werde
telegraphieren
und
erkundigungen
einziehen
now
do
you
think
if
you
said
to
an
english
i
saw
the
luggage
with
my
own
eyes
he
would
not
believe
you
no
in
my
opinion
the
whole
german
needs
revision
would
you
believe
it
we
did
not
make
fifty
kilometers
in
the
hour
and
yet
our
engine
broke
down
before
magdeburg
so
this
would
be
the
end
the
end
of
foolish
dreams
and
weak
hopes
which
he
had
never
put
into
words
even
to
himself
which
had
never
properly
existed
and
yet
had
been
there
nevertheless
a
mass
of
gloriously
vague
perhapses
the
end
was
at
hand
an
end
before
there
had
been
any
beginning
the
annoyance
of
the
perpetual
interruptions
went
on
the
voice
on
the
other
side
a
lady
who
was
travelling
in
the
same
compartment
a
very
pleasant
person
who
was
coming
over
to
be
a
teacher
in
a
school
in
dresden
i
have
promised
to
show
her
our
lions
when
she
visits
leipzig
well
as
i
was
saying
she
was
quite
alarmed
the
first
time
he
entered
in
that
way
and
it
took
me
some
time
i
assure
you
to
make
her
believe
that
this
was
the
german
method
of
revising
tickets
the
break
occasioned
by
the
arrival
of
the
beer
had
been
of
short
duration
and
the
audience
was
growing
impatient
at
the
back
of
the
room
some
one
began
to
stamp
his
feet
others
took
it
up
furst
perspired
with
anxiety
and
made
repeated
journeys
to
the
to
see
if
schilsky
were
not
coming
the
latter
was
almost
an
hour
late
by
now
and
jests
bald
and
witty
were
made
at
his
expense
some
one
offered
to
take
a
bet
that
he
had
fallen
asleep
and
forgotten
the
appointment
and
at
this
one
of
the
girls
on
the
bed
a
handsome
creature
with
bold
prominent
eyes
related
an
anecdote
to
her
neighbours
concerning
schilsky
powers
of
sleep
all
three
exploded
with
laughter
in
a
growing
desire
to
be
asked
to
play
boehmer
had
for
some
time
hung
about
the
piano
and
was
now
just
about
to
drop
as
if
by
accident
upon
the
stool
when
the
cry
of
no
bach
was
raised
bach
was
boehmer
specialty
and
and
he
retired
red
and
discomfited
to
his
place
in
a
corner
of
the
room
where
his
companion
a
statuesque
little
english
widow
made
biting
observations
on
the
company
behaviour
the
general
rowdyism
was
at
its
height
when
some
one
had
the
happy
idea
that
krafft
should
sing
them
his
newest
song
at
this
there
was
a
unanimous
shriek
of
approval
and
several
hands
dragged
krafft
to
the
piano
but
himself
the
wildest
of
them
all
he
needed
no
forcing
flinging
himself
down
on
the
seat
he
preluded
wildly
in
imitation
of
rubinstein
his
hearers
sat
with
their
mouths
open
a
fixed
smile
on
their
faces
laughter
ready
in
their
throats
and
only
madeleine
was
coolly
contemptuous
she
said
in
a
low
voice
krafft
was
confidently
expected
to
burst
into
one
of
those
songs
for
which
he
was
renowned
few
of
his
friends
were
able
to
sing
them
and
no
one
but
himself
could
both
sing
and
play
them
simultaneously
they
were
a
monstrous
standing
joke
instead
of
this
however
he
turned
winked
at
his
audience
and
began
a
slow
melancholy
ditty
with
a
recurring
refrain
he
was
not
allowed
to
finish
the
first
verse
a
howl
of
disapproval
went
up
his
hearers
hooted
jeered
and
stamped
sick
cats
damn
your
sonne
this
was
the
refrain
put
your
head
in
a
bag
pity
he
drinks
give
us
one
of
the
rousers
the
rou
sers
krafft
himself
laughed
unbridledly
das
ich
spricht
he
announced
in
c
sharp
major
there
was
a
hush
of
anticipation
in
which
dove
stopping
his
bretzel
to
his
mouth
was
heard
to
say
in
his
tone
of
measured
surprise
c
sharp
major
why
that
is
the
rest
was
drowned
in
the
wild
chromatic
passages
that
krafft
sent
up
and
down
the
piano
with
his
right
hand
while
his
left
followed
with
chords
each
of
which
exceeded
the
octave
before
however
there
was
time
to
laugh
this
riot
ceased
and
became
a
mournful
cadence
to
the
slowly
passing
harmonies
of
which
krafft
sang
i
am
weary
of
everything
that
is
under
the
sun
i
sicken
at
the
long
lines
of
rain
which
are
black
against
the
sky
they
drip
for
a
restless
heart
with
the
drip
of
despair
for
me
winds
must
rage
trees
bend
and
clouds
sail
stormily
the
whirlwind
of
the
prelude
commenced
anew
the
chords
became
still
vaster
the
player
swayed
from
side
to
side
like
a
in
a
storm
madeleine
said
tch
in
disgust
but
the
rest
of
the
company
who
had
only
waited
for
this
burst
into
peals
of
laughter
some
bent
double
in
their
seats
some
leant
back
with
their
chins
in
the
air
even
dove
smiled
just
however
as
those
whose
sense
of
humour
was
most
highly
developed
mopped
their
faces
with
gestures
of
exhaustion
and
assured
their
neighbours
that
they
could
not
really
could
not
laugh
any
more
furst
entered
and
flapped
his
hands
here
he
comes
a
sudden
silence
fell
broken
only
by
a
few
hysterical
giggles
from
the
ladies
and
by
a
frivolous
american
who
cried
now
for
also
schrie
zenophobia
krafft
stopped
playing
but
remained
sitting
at
the
piano
wiping
down
the
keys
with
his
handkerchief
schilsky
came
in
somewhat
embarrassed
by
the
lull
which
had
succeeded
the
hubbub
heard
in
the
passage
but
wholly
unconcerned
at
the
lateness
of
the
hour
except
in
matters
of
practical
advancement
time
did
not
exist
for
him
as
soon
as
he
appeared
the
two
ladies
in
the
front
row
began
to
clap
their
hands
the
rest
of
the
company
followed
their
example
then
in
spite
of
furst
efforts
to
prevent
it
rose
and
crowded
round
him
miss
jensen
and
her
friend
made
themselves
particularly
conspicuous
mrs
lauterischlager
had
an
infatuation
for
the
young
man
of
which
she
made
no
secret
she
laid
her
hand
caressingly
on
his
and
put
her
face
as
near
his
as
propriety
admitted
disgusting
the
way
those
women
go
on
with
him
said
madeleine
and
what
is
worse
he
likes
it
schilsky
listened
to
the
babble
of
compliments
with
that
mixture
of
boyish
deference
and
unequivocal
superiority
which
made
him
so
attractive
to
women
he
was
too
to
interrupt
them
and
free
himself
and
would
have
stood
as
long
as
they
liked
if
furst
had
not
come
to
the
rescue
and
led
him
to
the
piano
schilsky
laid
his
hand
affectionately
on
krafft
shoulder
and
krafft
sprang
up
in
exaggerated
surprise
the
audience
took
its
seats
again
the
thick
was
set
up
on
the
and
the
three
young
men
at
the
piano
had
a
brief
disagreement
with
one
another
about
turning
the
leaves
krafft
was
bent
on
doing
it
and
schilsky
objected
for
krafft
had
a
way
of
forgetting
what
he
was
at
in
the
middle
of
a
page
krafft
flushed
cast
an
angry
look
at
his
friend
and
withdrew
in
high
dudgeon
to
a
corner
standing
beside
the
piano
so
turned
to
those
about
him
that
the
two
on
the
sofa
in
the
next
room
only
saw
him
sideways
and
ill
at
that
schilsky
gave
a
short
description
of
his
work
he
was
nervous
which
aggravated
his
lisp
and
he
spoke
so
rapidly
and
in
such
a
low
voice
that
no
one
but
those
immediately
in
front
of
him
could
understand
what
he
said
but
it
did
not
matter
in
the
least
all
present
had
come
only
to
hear
the
music
they
knew
and
cared
nothing
about
zarathustra
and
his
spiritual
development
and
one
and
all
waited
impatiently
for
schilsky
to
stop
speaking
the
listeners
in
the
bedroom
merely
caught
disjointed
words
werdegang
notschrei
taranteln
but
not
one
was
curious
enough
even
to
lean
forward
in
his
seat
madeleine
made
sarcastic
inward
comments
on
the
behaviour
of
the
party
it
perfectly
clear
to
you
i
suppose
she
could
not
refrain
from
observing
as
at
the
finish
dove
sagely
wagged
his
head
in
agreement
it
transpired
that
there
was
an
ode
to
be
sung
before
the
last
section
of
the
composition
and
a
debate
ensued
who
should
sing
it
the
two
ladies
in
the
front
had
quite
a
little
quarrel
without
knowing
anything
about
the
song
as
to
which
of
their
voices
would
best
suit
it
schilsky
was
silent
for
a
moment
tapping
his
fingers
then
said
suddenly
come
on
heinz
and
looked
at
krafft
but
the
latter
who
was
standing
morose
with
folded
arms
did
not
move
he
had
a
dozen
reasons
why
he
should
not
sing
he
had
a
cold
was
hoarse
was
out
of
practice
could
not
read
the
music
from
sight
good
heavens
what
a
fool
heinz
is
making
of
himself
tonight
said
madeleine
but
schilsky
thumped
his
fist
on
the
lid
and
said
if
krafft
did
not
sing
it
no
one
should
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter
krafft
was
pulled
to
the
piano
schilsky
took
his
seat
and
losing
his
nervousness
as
soon
as
he
touched
the
keys
preluded
firmly
and
easily
with
his
large
white
hands
now
every
one
leaned
forward
to
see
him
better
especially
the
ladies
threw
themselves
into
positions
from
which
they
could
watch
hair
and
hands
and
the
slender
swaying
figure
is
he
divine
said
the
girl
on
the
bed
in
a
loud
whisper
and
hung
upon
her
companion
neck
in
an
ecstatic
attitude
after
the
diversity
of
noises
which
had
hitherto
interfered
with
his
thinking
connectedly
maurice
welcomed
the
continuous
sound
of
the
music
which
went
on
without
a
break
he
sat
in
a
listening
attitude
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
through
his
fingers
he
surreptitiously
watched
the
player
he
had
never
before
had
an
opportunity
of
observing
schilsky
so
closely
and
with
a
kind
of
blatant
generosity
he
now
pointed
out
to
himself
each
physical
detail
that
he
found
prepossessing
in
the
other
every
feature
that
was
likely
to
attract
in
the
next
breath
only
to
struggle
with
his
honest
opinion
that
the
composer
was
a
slippery
caddish
fellow
who
could
never
be
proved
to
be
worthy
of
louise
but
he
was
too
at
what
he
had
learnt
in
the
course
of
the
evening
to
rise
to
any
active
feeling
of
dislike
intermittently
he
heard
in
spite
of
himself
something
of
music
but
he
was
not
in
a
frame
of
mind
to
understand
or
to
retain
any
impression
of
it
he
was
more
effectively
jerked
out
of
his
preoccupation
by
single
spoken
words
which
from
time
to
time
struck
his
ear
this
was
furst
who
in
the
absence
of
a
programme
announced
from
his
seat
beside
schilsky
the
headings
of
the
different
sections
of
the
work
werdegang
seiltanzer
here
maurice
saw
dove
conducting
with
head
and
hand
notschrei
schwermut
taranteln
and
here
again
but
vaguely
as
if
at
a
distance
he
heard
suppressed
laughter
but
he
was
thoroughly
roused
when
krafft
picking
up
a
sheet
of
music
and
coming
round
to
the
front
of
the
piano
began
to
sing
das
trunkene
lied
by
way
of
introduction
the
low
f
in
the
bass
of
f
minor
sounded
persistently
at
syncopated
intervals
schilsky
inclined
his
head
and
krafft
sang
in
his
sweet
voice
oh
mensch
gieb
acht
was
spricht
die
tiefe
mitternacht
ich
schlief
ich
schlief
aus
tiefem
schlaf
bin
ich
erwacht
die
welt
ist
tief
und
tiefer
als
der
tag
gedacht
the
last
phrase
of
which
was
repeated
by
the
accompaniment
a
semitone
higher
tief
ist
ihr
weh
lust
tiefer
noch
als
herzeleid
as
far
as
this
the
voice
had
been
supported
by
simple
harmonies
now
from
out
the
depths
still
of
f
minor
rose
a
hesitating
theme
which
seemed
to
grope
its
way
in
imagination
one
heard
it
given
out
by
the
bass
strings
then
the
violas
reiterated
it
and
dyed
it
purple
voice
and
violins
sang
it
together
the
high
little
flutes
carried
it
up
and
beyond
out
of
reach
to
a
half
close
weh
spricht
vergeh
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
there
entered
a
light
yet
mournful
phrase
in
f
major
which
was
almost
a
and
seemed
to
be
a
small
frail
pleading
for
something
not
rightly
understood
doch
alle
lust
will
ewigkeit
will
tiefe
tiefe
ewigkeit
the
innocent
little
theme
passed
away
and
the
words
were
sung
again
to
a
stern
and
fateful
close
in
d
flat
major
the
concluding
section
of
the
work
returned
to
these
motives
developed
them
gathered
them
together
grouped
them
and
interchanged
them
in
complicated
thermatic
counterpoint
schilsky
was
barely
able
to
cope
with
the
difficulties
of
the
score
he
exerted
himself
desperately
laboured
with
his
head
and
his
whole
body
and
surmounted
sheerly
unplayable
parts
with
the
genial
slitheriness
that
is
the
privilege
of
composers
when
at
last
he
crashed
to
a
close
and
wiped
his
face
in
exhaustion
there
was
a
deafening
uproar
of
applause
loud
cries
were
uttered
and
exclamations
of
enthusiasm
people
rose
from
their
seats
and
crowded
round
the
piano
to
congratulate
the
player
lautenschlager
could
not
desist
from
kissing
his
hand
a
tall
thin
russian
girl
in
spectacles
who
had
assiduously
taken
notes
throughout
asked
in
a
loud
voice
and
her
peculiar
hoppy
german
for
information
about
the
orchestration
what
use
had
he
made
of
the
cymbals
she
trusted
a
purely
wagnerian
one
schilsky
hastened
to
reopen
the
score
and
sat
himself
to
answer
the
question
earnestly
and
at
length
come
maurice
let
us
go
said
madeleine
rising
and
shaking
the
creases
from
her
skirt
there
will
be
congratulations
enough
he
miss
ours
maurice
had
had
an
idea
of
lingering
till
everybody
else
had
gone
on
the
chance
of
picking
up
fresh
facts
but
he
was
never
good
at
excuses
so
they
slipped
out
into
the
passage
followed
by
dove
but
while
the
latter
was
looking
for
his
hat
madeleine
pulled
maurice
down
the
stairs
quick
let
us
go
she
whispered
and
as
they
heard
him
coming
after
them
she
drew
her
companion
down
still
further
to
the
cellar
flight
where
they
remained
hidden
until
dove
had
passed
them
and
his
steps
had
died
away
in
the
street
we
should
have
had
nothing
but
his
impressions
and
opinions
all
the
way
home
she
said
as
they
emerged
he
was
bottled
up
from
having
to
keep
quiet
so
long
i
saw
it
in
his
face
and
i
could
stand
it
i
in
a
bad
temper
as
you
may
have
observed
or
perhaps
you
have
no
he
had
not
noticed
it
well
you
would
have
if
you
had
been
so
taken
up
with
yourself
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
with
you
he
feigned
surprise
and
they
walked
in
silence
down
one
street
and
into
the
next
then
she
spoke
again
do
you
know
but
you
sure
not
to
know
that
either
you
gave
me
a
nasty
turn
i
his
surprise
was
genuine
this
time
yes
you
when
i
heard
you
say
to
heinz
he
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
but
she
was
not
in
a
hurry
to
continue
they
walked
another
and
all
she
said
was
how
refreshing
the
air
is
after
those
stuffy
rooms
as
they
turned
a
corner
however
she
made
a
fresh
start
i
think
it
rather
hard
on
me
she
said
and
laughed
as
she
spoke
here
am
i
again
having
to
lecture
you
the
fact
is
i
suppose
metier
clings
to
one
in
spite
of
oneself
but
there
must
be
something
about
you
too
maurice
guest
that
makes
one
want
to
do
it
want
to
look
after
you
so
to
speak
as
if
you
could
be
trusted
to
take
care
of
yourself
well
it
disturbed
me
to
see
how
intimate
you
and
heinz
have
got
is
that
all
why
on
earth
should
that
trouble
you
and
anyhow
he
added
the
whole
affair
came
about
without
any
wish
of
mine
how
she
demanded
and
when
he
had
told
her
and
since
then
he
went
into
detail
coolly
without
the
resentment
he
had
previously
felt
towards
krafft
and
that
all
is
it
enough
for
a
fellow
to
go
on
in
that
way
and
you
feel
aggrieved
no
not
now
at
first
i
was
rather
sore
though
for
heinz
is
an
interesting
fellow
and
we
were
very
thick
for
a
time
yes
of
course
until
schilsky
comes
back
as
soon
as
he
appears
on
the
scene
master
heinz
gives
you
the
cold
shoulder
or
perhaps
you
did
know
that
heinz
is
the
attendant
spirit
of
that
genius
maurice
did
not
reply
and
when
she
spoke
again
it
was
with
renewed
seriousness
believe
me
maurice
he
is
no
friend
for
you
it
not
only
that
you
ought
to
be
above
letting
yourself
be
treated
in
this
way
but
heinz
friendship
wo
do
you
any
good
he
belongs
to
a
bad
set
here
and
schilsky
too
if
you
were
long
with
heinz
you
would
be
bound
to
get
drawn
into
it
and
then
it
would
be
to
anything
you
might
have
done
to
work
and
success
no
take
my
advice
sincerely
meant
and
steer
clear
of
heinz
maurice
smiled
to
himself
at
her
womanly
idea
of
krafft
leading
him
to
perdition
but
you
fond
of
him
yourself
madeleine
he
said
you
ca
help
liking
him
either
i
daresay
i
ca
but
that
is
quite
a
different
matter
quite
and
as
if
more
than
enough
had
now
been
said
she
abruptly
left
the
subject
before
going
home
that
night
maurice
made
the
old
round
by
way
of
the
bruderstrasse
and
stood
and
looked
up
at
the
closed
windows
behind
which
louise
lived
the
house
was
dark
and
as
still
as
was
the
deserted
street
only
the
venetian
blinds
seemed
to
be
faintly
alive
the
outer
windows
removed
for
the
summer
had
not
yet
been
replaced
and
a
mild
wind
flapped
the
blinds
just
as
it
swayed
the
tops
of
the
trees
in
the
opposite
garden
there
was
a
breath
of
autumn
in
the
air
he
told
himself
aloud
in
the
nightly
silence
that
she
was
going
away
as
if
by
repeating
the
words
he
might
ultimately
grow
used
to
their
meaning
the
best
that
could
be
hoped
for
was
that
she
would
not
go
immediately
but
would
remain
in
leipzig
for
a
few
weeks
longer
then
a
new
fear
beset
him
what
if
she
never
came
back
again
if
she
had
left
the
place
quietly
of
set
purpose
if
these
windows
were
closed
for
good
and
all
a
dryness
invaded
his
throat
at
the
possibility
and
on
the
top
of
this
evening
of
almost
apathetic
resignation
to
the
inevitable
the
knowledge
surged
up
in
him
that
all
he
asked
was
to
be
allowed
to
see
her
just
once
more
afterwards
let
come
what
might
once
again
he
must
stand
face
to
face
with
her
must
stamp
a
picture
of
her
on
his
brain
to
carry
with
him
for
ever
for
ever
and
through
his
feverish
sleep
ran
like
a
thread
the
words
he
had
heard
krafft
sing
of
an
eternity
that
was
deep
and
dreamless
a
joy
without
beginning
or
end
madeleine
had
waved
her
umbrella
at
him
he
crossed
the
road
to
where
she
was
standing
in
and
galoshes
she
wished
to
tell
him
that
the
date
of
her
playing
in
the
abendunterhaltung
had
been
definitely
fixed
about
to
go
she
said
louise
is
back
did
you
know
of
course
he
knew
though
he
did
not
tell
her
so
knew
almost
the
exact
hour
at
which
the
blinds
had
been
drawn
up
the
windows
opened
and
a
in
a
gaudy
pink
paper
put
out
on
the
sill
not
many
days
after
this
he
came
upon
louise
herself
she
was
standing
talking
at
a
to
the
shabby
little
englishman
eggis
with
whom
she
had
walked
the
foyer
of
the
theatre
maurice
was
about
to
bow
and
pass
by
but
she
smiled
and
held
out
her
hand
you
are
back
too
then
i
am
meeting
all
my
friends
she
had
fur
about
her
neck
although
the
weather
was
not
really
cold
and
her
face
rose
out
of
this
setting
like
a
flower
from
its
cup
this
meeting
and
the
few
cordial
words
she
had
spoken
helped
him
over
the
days
that
followed
sometimes
while
he
waited
for
the
blow
to
fall
his
daily
life
grew
very
unimportant
things
that
had
hitherto
interested
him
now
went
past
like
shadows
he
himself
was
a
mere
automaton
but
sometimes
too
and
especially
after
he
had
seen
louise
and
touched
her
living
hand
he
wondered
whether
he
were
not
perhaps
tormenting
himself
unnecessarily
nothing
more
had
come
to
light
no
one
had
hinted
by
a
word
at
schilsky
departure
it
might
yet
prove
to
be
all
a
mistake
then
however
he
received
a
postcard
from
madeleine
saying
that
she
had
something
interesting
to
tell
him
he
went
too
early
and
spent
a
quarter
of
an
hour
pacing
her
room
when
she
entered
she
threw
him
a
look
and
before
she
had
finished
taking
off
her
wraps
said
maurice
i
have
a
piece
of
news
for
you
schilsky
is
going
away
he
nodded
his
throat
was
dry
why
you
do
mean
to
say
you
knew
she
cried
and
paused
out
of
her
jacket
maurice
went
to
the
window
and
stood
with
his
back
to
her
in
one
of
the
houses
opposite
at
a
window
on
the
same
level
a
girl
was
practising
the
violin
his
eyes
followed
the
mechanical
movements
of
the
bow
he
cleared
his
throat
do
you
is
it
likely
i
mean
do
you
think
madeleine
understood
him
yes
i
do
louise
wo
stay
here
a
day
longer
than
he
does
i
sure
of
that
but
otherwise
she
knew
no
more
than
maurice
and
she
did
not
offer
to
detain
him
when
a
few
minutes
later
he
alleged
a
pressing
appointment
madeleine
was
annoyed
and
showed
it
she
had
come
in
with
the
intention
of
being
kind
to
him
of
encouraging
him
and
discussing
the
matter
sympathetically
and
it
now
turned
out
that
not
only
had
he
known
it
all
the
time
but
had
also
kept
it
a
secret
from
her
she
did
not
like
underhand
ways
especially
in
people
whom
she
believed
she
knew
inside
out
now
that
the
pledge
of
secrecy
had
been
removed
from
him
maurice
felt
that
he
wanted
facts
and
without
thinking
more
about
it
than
if
he
had
been
there
the
day
before
he
climbed
the
stairs
that
led
to
krafft
lodging
he
found
him
at
supper
avery
was
present
too
and
on
the
table
sat
wotan
who
was
being
regaled
with
strips
of
skin
off
the
sausage
krafft
greeted
maurice
with
a
touch
of
his
former
effusiveness
for
he
was
in
a
talkative
mood
and
needed
an
audience
at
his
order
avery
put
an
extra
plate
on
the
table
and
maurice
had
to
share
their
meal
it
was
not
hard
for
him
to
lead
krafft
round
to
the
desired
subject
it
seemed
that
one
of
the
masters
in
the
conservatorium
had
expressed
a
very
unequivocal
opinion
of
schilsky
talents
as
a
composer
and
krafft
was
now
sarcastic
now
merry
at
this
critic
expense
maurice
laid
down
his
knife
and
in
the
first
break
asked
abruptly
when
does
he
go
go
who
said
krafft
indifferently
tickling
wotan
nose
with
a
piece
of
skin
which
he
held
out
of
reach
who
why
schilsky
of
course
it
sounded
as
if
another
than
he
had
said
the
words
they
were
so
short
and
harsh
the
plate
avery
was
holding
fell
to
the
floor
krafft
sat
back
in
his
chair
and
stared
at
maurice
with
a
face
that
was
all
eyes
you
knew
he
was
going
away
or
did
you
asked
maurice
in
a
rough
voice
every
one
knows
the
whole
place
knows
krafft
laughed
the
whole
place
knows
every
one
knows
he
repeated
every
one
yes
every
one
but
me
every
one
but
me
who
had
most
right
to
know
yes
i
alone
had
the
right
for
no
one
has
loved
him
as
i
have
he
rose
from
the
table
knocking
over
his
chair
or
else
it
is
not
true
yes
it
is
true
then
you
did
know
said
maurice
bewildered
by
the
outburst
he
had
evoked
no
we
did
know
it
was
avery
who
spoke
she
was
on
her
knees
picking
up
the
pieces
of
the
plate
with
slow
methodical
fingers
krafft
stood
hesitating
then
he
went
to
the
piano
opened
it
adjusted
the
seat
and
made
all
preparations
for
playing
but
with
his
fingers
ready
on
the
keys
he
changed
his
mind
and
instead
laid
his
arms
on
the
folded
rack
and
his
head
on
his
arms
he
did
not
stir
again
and
a
long
silence
followed
the
only
sound
that
was
to
be
heard
came
from
wotan
who
sitting
on
his
haunches
on
a
corner
of
the
table
washed
the
white
fur
of
his
belly
with
an
audible
swish
xiv
whistling
to
him
to
stop
furst
ran
the
length
of
a
after
maurice
as
the
latter
left
the
conservatorium
i
say
guest
he
said
breathlessly
on
catching
up
with
him
look
here
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
you
must
be
sure
and
join
us
we
are
going
to
give
schilsky
a
jolly
they
stood
at
the
corner
of
the
wachterstrasse
it
was
a
blowy
day
maurice
replied
evasively
with
his
eyes
on
the
unbound
volume
of
beethoven
that
furst
was
carrying
its
tattered
edges
moved
in
the
wind
when
does
he
go
he
asked
without
any
show
of
concern
furst
looked
warily
round
him
and
dropped
his
voice
well
look
here
guest
i
do
mind
telling
you
he
said
he
was
perspiring
from
his
run
and
dried
his
neck
and
face
i
do
mind
telling
you
you
pass
it
on
for
he
has
his
reasons
family
or
domestic
reasons
if
one
may
say
so
he
winked
and
nudged
maurice
with
his
elbow
for
not
wanting
it
to
get
about
it
deuced
hard
on
him
that
it
should
have
leaked
out
at
all
i
do
know
how
it
happened
for
i
was
mum
my
honour
i
was
yes
and
when
does
he
go
repeated
his
hearer
with
the
same
want
of
interest
morning
early
by
the
first
train
now
to
be
rid
of
him
but
it
was
never
easy
to
get
away
from
furst
and
since
maurice
had
declared
his
intention
of
continuing
to
take
lessons
from
him
as
good
as
impossible
furst
was
overpowering
in
his
friendliness
and
on
this
particular
occasion
there
was
no
escape
for
maurice
before
he
had
promised
to
make
one
of
the
party
that
was
to
meet
that
night
at
a
restaurant
in
the
town
then
he
bluffly
alleged
an
errand
in
the
plagwitzerstrasse
and
went
off
in
an
opposite
direction
to
that
which
his
companion
had
to
take
as
soon
as
furst
was
out
of
sight
he
turned
into
the
path
that
led
to
the
woods
overhead
the
sky
was
a
monotonous
grey
expanse
and
a
soft
moist
wind
drove
in
gusts
before
which
on
the
open
he
bent
his
head
it
was
a
wind
that
seemed
heavy
with
unfallen
rain
a
melancholy
wind
as
the
day
itself
was
melancholy
in
its
faded
colours
and
cloying
mildness
with
his
music
under
his
arm
maurice
walked
to
the
shelter
of
the
trees
now
that
he
had
learnt
the
worst
a
kind
of
numbness
came
over
him
he
had
felt
so
intensely
in
the
course
of
the
past
week
that
now
the
crisis
was
there
he
seemed
destitute
of
feeling
his
feet
bore
him
mechanically
to
his
favourite
seat
and
here
he
remained
with
his
head
in
his
hands
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
trodden
gravel
of
the
path
he
had
to
learn
once
and
for
all
that
by
tomorrow
everything
would
be
over
for
notwithstanding
the
wretchedness
of
the
past
days
he
was
as
far
off
as
ever
from
understanding
but
he
was
loath
to
begin
he
sat
in
a
kind
of
torpor
conscious
only
of
the
objects
his
eyes
rested
on
some
children
had
built
a
house
of
pebbles
with
a
path
leading
up
to
the
doorway
and
at
this
he
gazed
estimating
the
crude
architectural
ideas
that
had
occurred
to
the
childish
builders
he
felt
the
wind
in
his
hair
and
listened
to
the
soothing
noise
it
made
high
above
his
head
but
gradually
overcoming
this
physical
dullness
his
mind
began
to
work
again
with
a
sudden
vividness
he
saw
himself
as
he
had
walked
these
very
woods
seven
months
before
he
remembered
the
brilliant
colouring
of
the
april
day
and
the
abundance
of
energy
that
had
possessed
him
then
on
looking
into
the
future
all
his
thoughts
had
been
of
strenuous
endeavour
and
success
now
success
was
a
word
like
any
other
and
left
him
cold
for
a
long
time
in
place
of
passing
on
to
his
real
preoccupation
he
considered
this
brooding
over
the
change
that
had
come
about
in
him
was
it
he
asked
himself
because
he
had
so
little
endurance
that
when
once
a
thing
was
within
his
grasp
that
grasp
slackened
was
it
that
he
was
able
to
make
the
effort
required
for
a
leap
then
the
leap
over
could
not
right
himself
again
he
believed
that
the
slackening
interest
the
inability
to
fix
his
attention
which
he
had
had
to
fight
against
of
late
must
have
some
such
deeper
significance
for
his
whole
nature
the
inherited
common
sense
of
generations
rebelled
against
tracing
it
back
to
the
day
on
which
he
had
seen
a
certain
face
for
the
first
time
it
was
too
absurd
to
be
credible
that
because
a
slender
girl
had
suddenly
come
within
his
range
of
vision
his
life
should
thus
lose
form
and
purpose
incredible
and
unnatural
as
well
and
in
his
present
mood
he
would
have
laughed
at
the
suggestion
that
this
was
love
to
his
mind
love
was
something
frank
and
beautiful
made
for
daylight
and
the
sun
whereas
his
condition
was
a
source
of
mortification
to
him
to
love
without
any
possible
hope
of
return
to
love
knowing
that
the
person
you
loved
regarded
you
with
less
than
indifference
and
what
was
worse
that
this
person
was
passionately
attached
to
another
man
no
there
was
something
indelicate
about
it
at
which
his
blood
revolted
it
was
the
kind
of
thing
that
it
suited
poets
to
make
tragedies
of
but
it
did
not
should
not
happen
in
sober
daily
life
and
if
as
it
seemed
in
this
case
it
was
beyond
mortal
power
to
prevent
it
then
the
only
fitting
thing
to
do
was
promptly
to
make
an
end
and
because
over
the
approach
of
this
end
he
suffered
he
now
called
himself
hard
names
what
had
he
expected
had
he
really
believed
that
matters
could
always
dally
on
in
this
pleasant
torturous
way
would
he
always
have
been
content
to
be
third
party
and
miserable
outsider
no
the
best
that
could
happen
to
him
was
now
happening
let
the
coming
day
once
be
past
let
a
very
few
weeks
have
run
their
course
and
the
parting
would
have
lost
its
sting
he
would
be
able
to
look
back
regretfully
no
doubt
but
as
on
something
done
with
irrecoverable
then
he
would
apply
himself
to
his
work
with
all
his
heart
and
it
would
be
possible
to
think
of
her
and
remember
her
calmly
if
once
an
end
were
put
to
these
daily
chances
of
seeing
her
which
perpetually
fanned
his
unrest
all
would
go
well
and
yet
did
he
close
his
eyes
and
let
her
face
rise
up
before
him
her
sweet
white
face
with
the
unfathomable
eyes
and
pale
sensuous
mouth
he
was
shaken
by
an
emotion
that
knocked
his
resolutions
as
flat
as
a
breath
knocks
a
house
of
cards
it
was
not
love
nor
anything
to
do
with
love
this
he
could
have
sworn
to
it
was
merely
the
strange
physical
effect
her
presence
or
the
remembrance
of
her
presence
had
had
upon
him
from
the
first
day
on
a
tightening
of
all
centres
a
heightening
of
all
faculties
an
intense
hope
and
as
intense
a
despair
and
in
this
moment
he
confessed
to
himself
that
he
would
have
been
to
live
on
just
as
he
had
been
doing
if
only
sometimes
he
might
see
her
he
needed
her
as
he
had
never
felt
the
need
of
anyone
before
his
nature
clamoured
for
her
imperiously
as
it
clamoured
for
light
and
air
he
had
no
concern
with
anyone
but
her
her
only
and
he
could
not
let
her
go
it
was
not
love
it
was
a
bodily
weakness
a
pitiable
infirmity
he
even
felt
it
degrading
that
another
person
should
be
able
to
exercise
such
an
influence
over
him
that
there
should
be
a
part
of
himself
over
which
he
had
no
control
not
to
see
her
not
to
be
able
to
gather
fresh
strength
from
each
chance
meeting
meant
that
the
grip
life
had
of
him
would
relax
he
grew
sick
even
at
the
thought
of
how
in
some
unknown
place
in
the
midst
of
strangers
she
would
go
on
living
and
giving
her
hand
and
her
smile
to
other
people
while
he
would
never
see
her
again
and
he
said
her
name
aloud
to
himself
as
if
he
were
in
bodily
pain
or
as
if
the
sound
of
it
might
somehow
bring
him
aid
he
inwardly
implored
whatever
fate
was
above
him
to
give
him
the
one
small
chance
he
asked
the
chance
of
fair
play
the
morning
passed
without
his
knowing
it
when
considerably
after
his
usual
he
was
back
in
his
room
he
looked
at
familiar
objects
with
unseeing
eyes
he
was
not
conscious
of
hunger
but
going
into
the
kitchen
begged
for
a
cup
of
the
coffee
that
could
be
smelt
brewing
on
frau
krause
stove
when
he
had
drunk
this
a
veil
seemed
to
lift
from
his
brain
he
opened
and
read
a
letter
from
home
and
was
pricked
by
compunction
at
the
thought
that
except
for
a
few
scales
run
hastily
that
morning
he
had
done
no
work
but
while
he
still
stood
with
his
arm
on
the
lid
of
the
piano
an
exclamation
rose
to
his
lips
and
taking
up
his
hat
he
went
down
the
stairs
again
and
out
into
the
street
what
was
he
thinking
of
if
he
wished
to
see
louise
once
more
his
place
was
under
her
windows
or
in
those
streets
she
would
be
likely
to
pass
through
he
walked
up
and
down
before
the
house
in
the
bruderstrasse
sometimes
including
a
side
street
in
order
to
avoid
making
himself
conspicuous
putting
on
a
hurried
air
if
anyone
looked
curiously
at
him
lingering
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
on
end
in
the
shadow
of
a
neighbouring
doorway
gradually
yet
too
quickly
the
grey
afternoon
wore
to
a
close
he
had
paced
to
and
fro
for
an
hour
now
but
not
a
trace
of
her
had
he
seen
nor
did
even
a
light
burn
in
her
room
when
darkness
fell
a
fear
lest
she
should
have
already
gone
away
beset
him
again
and
got
the
upper
hand
of
him
and
wild
schemes
flitted
through
his
mind
he
would
mount
the
stairs
and
ring
the
on
some
pretext
or
other
to
learn
whether
she
was
still
there
and
his
foot
was
on
the
lowest
stair
when
his
courage
failed
him
and
he
turned
back
but
the
idea
had
taken
root
he
could
not
bear
much
longer
the
uncertainty
he
was
in
and
so
towards
seven
when
he
had
hung
about
for
three
hours
and
there
was
still
no
sign
of
life
in
her
room
he
went
boldly
up
the
broad
winding
stair
and
rang
the
bell
when
the
door
was
opened
he
would
find
something
to
say
the
bell
which
he
had
pulled
hard
pealed
through
the
house
jangled
on
and
in
a
series
of
died
away
there
was
no
immediate
answering
sound
the
silence
persisted
and
having
waited
for
some
time
he
rang
again
then
in
the
distance
he
heard
a
door
creak
soft
cautious
footsteps
crept
along
the
passage
a
light
moved
the
glass
window
in
the
upper
half
of
the
door
was
opened
and
a
little
old
woman
peered
out
holding
a
candle
above
her
head
on
seeing
the
pale
face
close
before
her
she
drew
back
and
made
as
if
to
shut
the
window
for
as
a
result
of
poring
over
newspapers
she
lived
in
continual
expectation
of
robbery
and
murder
she
is
not
at
home
she
said
with
tremulous
bravado
in
answer
to
the
young
man
question
and
again
was
about
to
close
the
window
but
maurice
thrust
in
his
hand
and
she
could
not
shut
without
crushing
it
then
she
is
still
here
has
she
gone
out
when
will
she
be
back
he
queried
how
should
i
know
and
look
here
young
man
if
you
do
take
away
your
hand
and
leave
the
house
at
once
i
shall
call
from
the
window
for
a
policeman
he
went
slowly
down
the
stairs
and
across
the
street
and
took
up
anew
his
position
in
the
dark
doorway
a
proceeding
which
did
not
reassure
fraulein
grunhut
who
regarding
his
inquiries
as
a
feint
was
watching
his
movements
from
between
the
slats
of
a
but
maurice
had
not
stood
again
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
a
feeling
of
nausea
seized
him
and
this
reminded
him
that
he
had
practically
eaten
nothing
since
the
morning
if
he
meant
to
hold
out
he
must
snatch
a
bite
of
food
somewhere
afterwards
he
would
return
and
wait
if
he
had
to
wait
all
night
in
front
of
the
panorama
on
the
rossplatz
he
ran
into
the
arms
of
furst
and
the
latter
when
he
heard
where
maurice
was
going
had
nothing
better
to
do
than
to
accompany
him
and
drink
a
schnitt
furst
who
was
in
capital
spirits
at
the
prospect
of
the
evening
laughed
heartily
told
witty
anecdotes
and
slapped
his
fat
thigh
the
type
of
rubicund
and
as
he
was
not
of
an
observant
turn
of
mind
he
did
not
notice
his
companion
abstraction
hardly
troubling
to
dissemble
maurice
paid
scant
attention
to
furst
talk
he
ate
avidly
and
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
pushed
back
his
chair
and
called
to
the
waiter
for
his
bill
i
must
go
he
said
and
rose
i
have
something
important
to
do
this
evening
and
ca
join
you
furst
cut
short
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
let
his
double
chin
fall
on
his
collar
and
gazed
at
his
companion
but
i
say
guest
look
here
maurice
heard
him
expostulate
as
the
outer
door
slammed
behind
him
he
made
haste
to
retrace
his
steps
the
wind
had
dropped
a
fine
rain
was
beginning
to
fall
it
promised
to
be
a
wet
night
of
empty
streets
and
glistening
pavements
there
was
no
visible
change
in
the
windows
of
the
bruderstrasse
they
were
as
blankly
dark
as
before
turning
up
his
maurice
resumed
his
patrollings
but
more
languidly
he
was
drowsy
from
having
eaten
and
the
air
was
chill
a
weakness
overcame
him
at
the
thought
of
the
he
had
set
himself
it
seemed
impossible
to
endure
the
crawling
past
of
still
more
hours
he
was
tired
to
exhaustion
and
a
sudden
strong
desire
arose
in
him
somehow
anyhow
to
be
taken
out
of
himself
to
have
his
thoughts
diverted
into
other
channels
and
this
feeling
grew
upon
him
with
such
force
the
idea
of
remaining
where
he
was
for
another
hour
became
so
intolerable
that
he
forgot
everything
else
and
turned
and
ran
back
towards
the
panorama
only
afraid
lest
furst
should
have
gone
without
him
the
latter
was
in
fact
just
coming
out
of
the
door
he
stared
in
astonishment
at
maurice
i
changed
my
mind
said
maurice
without
apology
shall
we
go
where
the
place
furst
mumbled
something
inaudible
he
was
grumpy
at
the
behaviour
scanning
him
furtively
and
noting
his
odd
excited
manner
he
concluded
that
maurice
had
been
drinking
they
walked
without
speaking
furst
hummed
to
himself
in
the
business
thoroughfare
the
bruhl
they
entered
a
dingy
cafe
and
while
furst
chattered
with
the
landlord
and
buffetdame
with
both
of
whom
he
was
on
very
friendly
terms
maurice
went
into
the
where
the
kneipe
was
to
be
held
and
sat
down
before
a
long
narrow
table
spread
with
a
soiled
red
and
tablecloth
he
felt
cold
and
sick
again
and
when
the
wan
piccolo
set
a
before
him
he
sent
the
lad
to
the
devil
for
a
cognac
the
waiter
came
with
the
maurice
drank
the
contents
of
one
and
then
another
of
the
tiny
glasses
a
genial
warmth
ran
through
him
and
his
nausea
ceased
he
leaned
his
head
on
his
hands
closed
his
eyes
and
soothed
by
the
heat
of
the
room
had
a
few
moments
pleasant
lapse
of
consciousness
he
was
roused
by
the
entrance
of
a
noisy
party
of
three
these
were
strangers
to
him
and
when
they
had
mentioned
their
names
and
learned
his
they
sat
down
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
and
talked
among
themselves
they
were
followed
by
a
couple
of
men
known
to
maurice
by
sight
one
an
italian
a
stout
animated
man
with
prominent
eyes
and
huge
white
teeth
was
a
of
schilsky
and
a
violinist
of
repute
notwithstanding
the
size
and
fleshiness
of
his
hands
which
were
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
delicate
build
of
his
instrument
the
other
was
a
slender
youth
of
fantastic
appearance
he
wore
a
long
overcoat
which
reached
to
his
heels
and
was
moulded
to
a
shapely
waist
on
his
fingers
were
numerous
rings
his
bushy
hair
was
scented
and
thickly
curled
his
face
painted
and
pencilled
like
a
woman
he
did
not
sit
down
but
returning
to
the
public
room
leaned
over
the
counter
and
talked
to
the
buffetdame
in
a
tone
which
had
nothing
in
common
with
furst
hearty
familiarity
next
came
a
couple
of
americans
loud
careless
of
dress
and
convention
close
behind
them
still
another
group
and
at
its
heels
dove
the
latter
entered
the
room
with
an
apologetic
air
and
on
sitting
down
at
the
head
of
the
table
next
maurice
mentioned
at
once
that
at
heart
he
was
not
partial
to
this
kind
of
thing
and
was
only
there
because
he
believed
the
present
to
be
an
exceptional
occasion
who
knew
but
what
in
after
years
he
might
not
be
proud
to
claim
having
made
one
of
the
party
on
this
particular
evening
the
plain
truth
being
that
schilsky
was
little
popular
with
his
own
sex
and
in
consequence
of
the
difficulty
of
beating
up
a
round
dozen
of
men
furst
had
been
forced
to
be
very
pressing
in
his
invitations
to
have
recourse
to
bribes
and
promises
or
as
in
the
case
of
dove
to
stimulating
the
imagination
the
majority
of
the
guests
present
were
not
particular
who
paid
for
their
drink
provided
they
got
it
at
krafft
entry
a
stifled
laugh
went
round
to
judge
from
his
appearance
he
had
not
been
in
bed
the
previous
night
sleep
seemed
to
hang
on
his
red
and
sunken
eyelids
his
hands
and
face
were
dirty
and
when
he
took
off
his
coat
which
he
had
worn
turned
up
at
the
neck
it
was
seen
that
he
had
either
lost
or
forgotten
his
collar
shirt
and
waistcoat
were
insufficiently
buttoned
his
walk
was
steady
but
his
eyes
had
a
glassy
stare
and
did
not
seem
to
see
what
they
rested
on
a
strong
odour
of
brandy
went
out
from
him
but
he
had
not
been
many
minutes
in
the
room
before
a
stronger
and
more
penetrating
smell
made
itself
felt
the
rest
of
the
company
began
to
sniff
and
ejaculate
and
furst
having
tracked
it
to
the
corner
where
the
overcoats
hung
drew
out
of
one
of
krafft
pockets
a
greasy
newspaper
parcel
evidently
some
days
old
containing
bones
scraps
of
decaying
meat
and
rancid
fish
the
piccolo
summoned
by
a
general
shout
was
bade
to
dispose
of
the
garbage
instantly
and
to
hang
the
coat
in
a
draughty
place
to
air
various
epithets
were
hurled
at
krafft
who
however
sat
picking
his
teeth
with
unconcern
as
if
what
went
on
around
him
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
they
were
now
all
collected
but
schilsky
and
much
beer
had
been
drunk
furst
was
in
his
usual
state
of
agitation
lest
his
friend
should
forget
to
keep
the
appointment
and
the
spirits
of
those
there
were
several
such
present
who
suffered
almost
physical
pain
from
seeing
another
than
themselves
the
centre
of
interest
went
up
by
leaps
and
bounds
but
at
this
juncture
schilsky
voice
was
heard
in
the
next
room
it
was
raised
and
angry
it
snarled
at
a
waiter
significant
glances
flew
round
the
table
for
the
young
man
outbursts
of
temper
were
well
known
to
all
he
entered
making
no
response
to
the
greetings
that
were
offered
him
displaying
his
anger
with
genial
indifference
to
what
others
thought
of
him
to
the
piccolo
he
tossed
coat
and
hat
and
swore
at
the
boy
for
not
catching
them
then
he
let
his
body
down
on
the
vacant
chair
and
drank
off
the
glass
of
pilsener
that
was
set
before
him
there
was
a
pause
of
embarrassment
the
next
moment
however
several
men
spoke
at
once
furst
continued
a
story
he
was
telling
some
one
else
capped
it
and
the
mirth
these
anecdotes
provoked
was
more
than
ordinarily
uproarious
schilsky
sat
silent
letting
his
sullen
mouth
hang
and
tapping
the
table
with
his
fingers
meanwhile
he
emptied
one
glass
of
beer
after
another
the
piccolo
could
hardly
cope
with
the
demands
that
were
made
on
him
and
staggered
about
with
his
load
of
glasses
but
it
was
impossible
to
let
the
evening
pass
as
flatly
as
this
besides
as
the
general
hilarity
increased
it
made
those
present
less
sensitive
to
the
mood
of
the
guest
of
honour
furst
was
a
born
speaker
and
his
heart
was
full
so
presently
he
rose
to
his
feet
struck
his
glass
and
in
spite
of
schilsky
deepening
scowl
held
a
flowery
speech
about
his
departing
friend
the
only
answer
schilsky
gave
was
a
muttered
request
to
cease
making
an
idiot
of
himself
this
was
going
rather
too
far
but
no
one
protested
except
ford
the
pianist
who
said
in
english
speesch
call
that
a
speesch
furst
inclined
in
the
first
moment
of
rebuff
to
be
touchy
allowed
his
natural
goodness
of
heart
to
prevail
he
leaned
forward
and
said
not
without
pathos
old
man
we
are
all
your
friends
here
something
the
matter
tell
us
what
it
is
before
schilsky
could
reply
krafft
awakened
from
his
apparent
stupor
to
say
with
extreme
distinctness
i
tell
you
there
been
the
devil
to
pay
now
chuck
it
krafft
cried
one
or
two
not
without
alarm
at
the
turn
things
might
take
but
schilsky
whose
anger
had
begun
to
subside
under
the
influence
of
the
two
litres
he
had
drunk
said
slowly
and
thickly
let
him
be
what
he
says
is
the
truth
gospel
truth
oh
say
that
to
bad
cried
one
of
the
americans
a
lean
man
with
the
mouth
and
chin
of
a
methodist
all
kept
silence
now
in
the
hope
that
schilsky
would
continue
as
he
did
not
but
sat
brooding
furst
in
his
role
of
peacemaker
clapped
him
on
the
back
well
forget
it
for
old
man
what
does
it
matter
you
be
miles
away
this
struck
a
reminiscence
in
ford
who
forthwith
tried
to
sing
i
off
by
the
morning
train
across
the
raging
main
that
easily
said
schilsky
threw
a
dark
look
round
the
table
by
those
who
have
been
through
it
i
have
and
i
rather
have
lost
a
hand
krafft
laughed
that
is
to
say
a
cackle
of
laughter
issued
from
his
mouth
while
his
glazed
eyes
stared
idiotically
he
shall
tell
us
about
it
waiter
a
round
of
schnaps
shut
up
krafft
said
furst
uneasily
damn
you
heinz
cried
schilsky
striking
the
table
he
swallowed
his
brandy
at
a
gulp
and
held
out
the
glass
to
be
refilled
his
anger
fell
still
more
he
began
to
commiserate
himself
by
hell
i
wish
a
plague
would
sweep
every
woman
off
the
earth
the
deuce
why
do
you
keep
clear
of
them
schilsky
laughed
without
raising
his
heavy
eyes
if
they
only
give
one
the
chance
damn
them
all
old
and
young
i
say
if
it
for
them
a
man
could
lead
a
quiet
life
it
all
come
out
in
the
wash
consoled
the
american
maurice
heard
everything
that
passed
distinctly
but
the
words
seemed
to
be
bandied
at
an
immeasurable
distance
from
him
he
remained
quite
undisturbed
and
would
have
felt
like
a
god
looking
on
at
the
doings
of
an
infinitesimal
world
had
it
not
been
for
a
wheel
which
revolved
in
his
head
and
hindered
him
from
thinking
connectedly
so
far
drinking
had
brought
him
no
pleasure
and
he
had
sense
enough
to
find
the
proximity
of
ford
disagreeable
for
the
latter
spilt
half
the
liquor
he
tried
to
swallow
over
himself
and
half
over
his
neighbour
a
fresh
imprecation
of
schilsky
called
forth
more
laughter
on
its
subsidence
krafft
awoke
to
his
surroundings
again
what
has
the
old
woman
given
you
he
asked
with
his
strange
precision
of
speech
and
his
drunken
eyes
schilsky
struck
the
table
with
his
fist
look
at
him
shamming
drunk
the
bitch
he
cried
never
mind
him
he
do
count
how
much
did
she
give
you
oh
gee
go
on
but
schilsky
turned
sullen
again
refused
to
answer
out
with
it
then
krafft
you
know
you
scoundrel
you
krafft
put
his
hand
to
the
side
of
his
mouth
she
gave
him
three
thousand
marks
on
all
sides
the
exclamations
flew
oh
golly
for
her
drei
tausend
mark
alle
ehre
again
krafft
leaned
forward
with
a
maudlin
laugh
jawohl
but
on
what
condition
heinz
you
ferret
out
things
like
a
pig
snout
said
furst
with
an
exaggerated
tipsy
disgust
what
the
old
louse
made
conditions
did
she
is
she
jealous
there
was
another
roar
at
this
schilsky
looked
as
black
as
thunder
again
furst
strove
to
intercede
jealous
in
seven
devils
name
why
jealous
the
old
scarecrow
she
has
an
ounce
of
flesh
to
her
bones
schilsky
laughed
much
you
know
about
it
you
fool
flesh
or
no
flesh
she
as
troublesome
as
the
plumpest
i
would
go
through
the
last
month
again
for
all
you
could
offer
me
month
no
nor
the
last
six
months
either
it
been
a
hell
of
a
life
three
of
whole
damned
three
at
my
heels
and
each
ready
to
tear
the
others
eyes
out
three
hullo
three
bah
what
three
sneered
the
painted
youth
schilsky
turned
on
him
what
three
go
and
try
it
if
you
want
to
know
you
suckling
three
i
said
and
they
ended
by
making
the
place
too
hot
to
hold
me
but
i
done
now
no
more
for
me
if
my
name
what
it
is
having
once
broken
through
his
reserve
he
talked
on
with
heated
fluency
and
the
longer
he
spoke
the
more
he
was
carried
away
by
his
grievances
for
all
he
had
asked
for
he
assured
his
hearers
had
been
peace
and
quiet
the
peace
necessary
to
important
work
jesus
and
mary
are
a
fellow
chief
obligations
not
his
obligations
to
himself
at
the
same
time
it
was
not
his
intention
to
put
any
of
the
blame
on
lulu
shoulders
she
could
help
herself
lulu
is
lulu
i
damned
fond
of
lulu
boys
and
i
always
done
my
best
by
her
is
there
anyone
here
who
wants
to
say
i
have
there
was
none
a
chorus
of
sympathetic
ayes
went
up
from
the
party
that
was
drinking
at
his
expense
mollified
he
proceeded
asserting
vehemently
that
he
would
have
gone
miles
out
of
his
way
to
avoid
causing
lulu
pain
i
a
fool
i
admit
it
where
a
woman
is
concerned
but
he
had
yielded
to
her
often
enough
too
often
as
it
was
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
make
a
stand
let
those
present
remember
what
he
had
sacrificed
only
that
summer
for
lulu
sake
would
anyone
else
have
done
as
much
for
his
girl
he
made
bold
to
doubt
it
for
a
man
like
zeppelin
to
come
to
him
and
to
declare
with
tears
in
his
eyes
that
he
could
teach
him
no
more
could
he
afford
to
treat
a
matter
like
that
with
indifference
had
he
really
been
free
to
make
a
choice
again
he
looked
round
the
table
with
emphasis
and
those
who
had
their
muscles
sufficiently
under
control
hastened
to
lay
their
faces
in
seemly
folds
then
however
schilsky
mood
changed
he
struck
the
table
so
that
the
glasses
danced
and
shall
i
tell
you
what
my
reward
has
been
for
not
going
do
you
want
to
know
how
lulu
has
treated
me
for
staying
on
here
are
a
quarter
of
an
hour
late
where
have
you
been
you
only
written
two
bars
since
i
saw
you
this
morning
what
have
you
been
doing
a
letter
has
come
in
a
strange
writing
who
is
it
from
put
on
another
tie
who
have
you
been
to
see
himmelsakrament
he
drained
his
glass
i
had
the
life
of
a
dog
i
tell
you
of
a
dog
there
not
been
a
moment
in
the
day
when
she
has
spied
on
me
and
followed
me
and
made
me
ridiculous
over
every
trifle
she
has
got
up
a
fresh
scene
she
even
gone
so
far
as
to
come
to
my
room
and
search
my
pockets
when
she
knew
i
was
at
home
yes
yes
sneered
krafft
exactly
and
so
gentlemen
he
was
now
for
slinking
off
without
a
word
to
her
oh
pfui
spat
the
american
call
him
a
liar
said
a
voice
liar
repeated
schilsky
dramatically
why
liar
i
do
deny
it
i
would
have
done
it
gladly
if
i
could
is
that
just
what
i
been
saying
lulu
would
have
got
over
it
all
the
quicker
alone
and
then
why
should
i
confess
it
you
all
my
friends
here
he
dropped
his
voice
i
afraid
of
lulu
boys
i
was
afraid
she
get
round
me
and
then
my
chance
was
gone
she
might
have
shot
me
but
she
would
have
let
me
go
you
never
know
how
a
woman
of
that
type
break
out
never
but
she
did
said
krafft
you
live
schilsky
understood
him
some
brute
he
cried
savagely
some
dirty
brute
had
nothing
better
to
do
than
to
tell
her
ha
ha
ha
laughed
the
painted
boy
furst
blew
his
nose
it
was
me
i
was
mum
my
honour
i
was
my
god
said
schilsky
and
fell
to
remembering
it
what
a
time
been
through
with
her
this
afternoon
he
threatened
to
be
overcome
by
the
recollection
and
supported
his
head
on
his
hands
a
woman
has
no
gratitude
he
murmured
and
drew
his
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
it
is
a
weak
childish
sex
with
no
inkling
of
higher
things
here
however
he
suddenly
drew
himself
up
life
is
very
hard
he
cried
in
a
loud
voice
the
perpetual
struggle
between
duty
and
inclination
for
a
man
of
genius
he
grew
franker
and
gave
gratuitous
details
of
the
scene
that
had
taken
place
in
his
room
that
afternoon
most
of
those
present
were
in
ecstasies
at
this
divulging
of
his
private
life
which
went
forward
to
the
accompaniment
of
snores
from
ford
and
the
voice
of
dove
who
with
portentous
gravity
sang
over
and
over
again
the
first
strophe
of
the
last
rose
of
summer
a
fury
said
schilsky
a
a
what
do
you
call
it
a

he
gave
it
up
and
went
on
by
god
but
lulu
knows
how
keep
clear
of
her
nails
boys
i
advise
you
at
this
point
he
pulled
back
his
collar
and
exhibited
a
long
dark
scratch
on
the
side
of
his
neck
a
little
remembrance
she
gave
me
to
take
away
with
me
while
he
displayed
it
he
seemed
to
be
rather
proud
of
it
but
immediately
afterwards
his
mood
veered
round
again
to
one
of
bitter
resentment
to
illustrate
the
injustice
she
had
been
guilty
of
and
his
own
he
related
at
length
the
story
of
his
flirtation
with
ephie
and
the
infinite
pains
he
had
been
at
to
keep
louise
in
ignorance
of
what
was
happening
he
grew
very
tender
with
himself
as
he
told
it
for
according
to
him
the
whole
affair
had
come
about
without
any
assistance
of
his
what
the
deuce
was
i
to
do
chucked
herself
full
at
my
head
did
the
little
one
no
invitation
necessary
a
ripe
plum
boys
touch
the
plum
and
off
it
tumbles
as
pretty
a
little
thing
too
as
ever
was
made
had
everything
arranged
by
the
second
meeting
papa
to
set
us
up
house
in
new
york
money
in
hulle
und
fulle
at
the
mention
of
new
york
the
lean
american
looked
grave
look
here
you
do
think
you
the
whole
shoot
because
you
got
a
wave
in
your
hair
he
murmured
in
english
but
schilsky
did
not
hear
him
his
voice
droned
on
giving
the
full
particulars
of
this
particular
case
he
grew
momentarily
opener
one
no
sooner
out
of
the
door
than
the
other
was
in
he
asserted
and
laughed
long
to
himself
for
some
time
past
maurice
had
been
possessed
by
the
idea
that
what
was
happening
concerned
him
very
nearly
and
that
he
ought
to
interfere
and
put
his
foot
down
his
hands
had
grown
cold
and
he
sat
vainly
trying
to
speak
nothing
however
came
but
little
drunken
gulps
and
hiccups
but
the
first
mention
of
ephie
name
seemed
to
put
new
strength
into
him
he
made
a
violent
effort
and
rose
to
his
feet
holding
on
to
the
table
with
both
hands
he
could
not
however
manage
to
attract
attention
no
one
took
any
notice
of
him
and
besides
this
he
had
himself
no
notion
what
it
was
that
he
really
wanted
to
say
and
drowns
his
sorrows
in
the
convivial
glass
he
suddenly
shouted
in
english
at
the
top
of
his
voice
which
he
had
found
he
had
a
vague
belief
that
he
was
quoting
a
line
of
poetry
and
though
he
did
not
in
the
least
understand
how
it
applied
to
the
situation
he
continued
to
repeat
it
with
varying
shades
of
fervour
till
some
one
called
out
oh
stop
your
blasted
rot
he
laughed
hoarsely
at
this
could
not
check
himself
and
was
so
exhausted
when
he
had
finished
that
it
took
him
some
time
to
remember
why
he
was
on
his
feet
schilsky
was
still
relating
his
face
was
darkly
red
his
voice
husky
and
he
flapped
his
arms
with
meaningless
gestures
a
passionate
rebellion
a
kind
of
primitive
hatred
gripped
maurice
and
when
schilsky
paused
for
breath
he
could
contain
himself
no
longer
he
felt
the
burning
need
of
contradicting
the
speaker
even
though
he
could
not
catch
the
drift
of
what
was
said
it
a
lie
he
cried
fiercely
with
such
emphasis
that
every
face
was
turned
to
him
a
damned
lie
a
lie
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
responded
not
one
but
many
voices
the
whole
table
seemed
to
be
asking
him
with
the
exception
of
dove
who
sang
on
in
an
ever
decreasing
tempo
get
out
let
him
alone
he
drunk
he
does
know
what
saying
he
got
rats
in
his
head
he
heard
voices
asserting
forthwith
he
began
a
lengthy
defence
of
himself
broken
only
by
gaps
in
which
his
brain
refused
to
work
conscious
that
no
one
was
listening
to
him
he
bawled
more
and
more
loudly
oh
quit
it
you
ass
said
the
american
schilsky
persuaded
by
those
next
him
to
let
the
incident
pass
unnoticed
contented
himself
with
a
verfluchte
schweinerei
spat
after
furst
gurgled
account
of
maurice
previous
insobriety
across
the
floor
behind
him
to
express
his
contempt
and
proceeded
as
dominatingly
as
before
with
the
narration
of
his
the
blood
rushed
to
maurice
head
at
the
sound
of
this
voice
which
he
could
neither
curb
nor
understand
rage
mastered
him
a
vehement
desire
to
be
quits
he
kicked
back
his
chair
and
rocked
to
and
fro
it
a
lie
a
dirty
lie
he
cried
you
make
her
unhappy
god
how
unhappy
you
make
her
you
illtreat
her
you
never
given
her
a
happiness
s
said
so
herself
i
heard
her
i
swear
i
his
voice
turned
to
a
whine
his
words
came
thick
and
incoherent
schilsky
sprang
to
his
feet
and
aimed
the
contents
of
a
glass
at
maurice
face
take
that
you
blasted
spy
you
englishman
he
spluttered
i
teach
you
to
mix
your
dirty
self
in
my
affairs
every
one
jumped
up
there
was
noise
and
confusion
simultaneously
two
waiters
entered
the
room
as
if
they
had
not
been
unprepared
for
something
of
this
kind
furst
and
another
man
restrained
schilsky
by
the
arms
reasoning
with
him
with
more
force
than
coherence
maurice
the
beer
dripping
from
chin
collar
and
struggled
furiously
with
some
one
who
held
him
back
let
me
get
at
him
let
me
get
at
him
he
cried
i
teach
him
to
treat
a
woman
as
he
does
the
sneak
the
cur
the
filthy
cad
he
not
fit
to
touch
her
hand
her
beautiful
hand
her
beau
ti
ful
here
overpowered
by
his
feelings
as
much
as
by
superior
strength
he
sank
on
a
chair
and
wept
i
break
his
bones
raved
schilsky
what
the
hell
does
he
mean
by
it
the
infame
schuft
the
aas
the
dirty
englander
thinks
sneak
after
her
himself
does
he
what
in
jesus
name
is
it
to
him
how
i
treat
her
i
take
a
stick
to
her
if
i
like
it
none
of
his
blasted
business
look
here
do
you
see
that
he
freed
one
hand
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
almost
inarticulate
with
rage
and
liquor
brandished
a
key
across
the
table
do
you
see
that
that
a
key
is
it
you
drunken
hog
well
with
that
key
i
can
let
myself
into
lulu
room
at
any
hour
i
want
to
i
can
go
there
now
this
very
minute
if
i
like
do
you
think
she
turn
me
out
you
infernal
spy
turn
me
out
she
go
down
on
her
knees
here
before
you
all
to
get
me
back
to
her
unwilling
to
be
involved
in
the
brawl
the
more
sober
of
the
party
had
begun
to
seek
out
their
hats
and
to
slink
away
a
little
group
round
schilsky
blarneyed
and
expostulated
why
should
the
whole
sport
of
the
evening
be
spoilt
in
this
fashion
what
did
it
matter
what
the
damned
cranky
englishman
said
let
him
be
left
to
his
swilling
they
would
clear
out
and
wind
up
the
night
at
the
bauer
and
at
four
when
that
shut
they
would
go
on
to
the
bayrische
bahnhof
where
they
could
not
only
get
coffee
but
could
also
see
schilsky
off
by
a
train
soon
after
five
these
persuasions
prevailed
and
still
swearing
and
threatening
and
promising
by
all
that
was
holy
to
bring
lulu
there
by
the
hair
of
her
head
if
necessary
to
show
whether
or
no
he
had
the
power
over
her
he
boasted
of
schilsky
finally
allowed
himself
to
be
dragged
off
and
those
who
were
left
lurched
out
in
his
wake
with
their
exit
an
abrupt
silence
fell
and
maurice
sank
into
a
heavy
sleep
in
which
he
saw
flowery
meadows
and
heard
a
gently
trickling
brook
now
then
up
with
you
get
along
some
one
was
shouting
in
his
ear
and
bit
by
bit
a
waiter
entered
his
field
of
view
past
time
anyhow
and
yawning
loudly
the
waiter
turned
out
all
the
but
one
do
yer
hear
up
with
you
you
have
to
look
after
the
other
now
damn
me
if
there
is
another
of
you
as
well
and
from
under
the
table
he
drew
out
a
recumbent
body
maurice
then
saw
that
he
was
still
in
the
company
of
dove
who
sat
staring
into
space
like
a
dead
man
krafft
propped
on
a
chair
hung
his
head
far
back
and
the
collarless
shirt
exposed
the
whole
of
his
white
throat
the
waiter
hustled
them
about
maurice
was
comparatively
steady
on
his
legs
and
it
was
found
that
dove
could
walk
but
over
krafft
the
man
scratched
his
head
and
called
a
comrade
at
the
mention
of
a
droschke
however
maurice
all
but
wept
anew
with
ire
and
emotion
this
was
his
dearest
friend
the
friend
of
his
bosom
he
was
ready
at
any
time
to
stake
his
life
for
him
and
now
he
was
not
to
be
allowed
even
to
see
him
home
a
difficulty
arose
about
maurice
hat
he
was
convinced
that
the
one
the
waiter
jammed
so
rudely
on
his
head
did
not
belong
to
him
and
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
in
the
world
had
ever
mattered
so
much
to
him
as
now
getting
back
his
own
hat
but
he
had
not
sufficient
fluency
to
explain
all
he
meant
before
he
had
finished
the
man
lost
patience
and
suddenly
without
any
transition
the
three
of
them
were
in
the
street
the
raw
night
air
gave
them
a
shock
they
gasped
and
choked
a
little
then
the
wall
of
a
house
rose
appositely
and
met
them
they
leaned
against
it
and
maurice
threw
the
hat
from
him
and
trampled
on
it
chuckling
at
the
idea
that
he
was
revenging
himself
on
the
waiter
it
was
a
journey
of
difficulties
not
only
was
he
unclear
what
locality
they
were
in
but
innumerable
lifeless
things
confronted
them
and
formed
obstacles
to
their
progress
they
had
to
charge
an
two
or
three
times
before
they
could
get
round
it
maurice
grew
excessively
angry
especially
with
dove
for
while
heinz
let
himself
be
lugged
this
way
and
that
dove
grown
loud
and
wilful
had
ideas
of
his
own
and
in
addition
to
this
sang
the
whole
time
with
drunken
gravity
sez
the
ragman
to
the
bagman
i
do
yees
no
harm
stop
it
you
oaf
cried
maurice
goaded
to
desperation
you
beastly
blathering
drunken
idiot
then
for
a
he
himself
lapsed
into
and
when
he
wakened
dove
was
gone
he
chuckled
anew
at
the
thought
that
somehow
or
other
they
had
managed
to
outwit
him
his
intention
had
been
to
make
for
home
but
the
door
before
which
they
ultimately
found
themselves
was
krafft
maurice
propped
his
companion
against
the
wall
and
searched
his
own
pockets
for
a
key
when
he
had
found
one
he
could
not
find
the
door
and
when
this
was
secured
the
key
would
not
fit
the
perspiration
stood
out
on
his
forehead
he
tried
again
and
again
thought
the
keyhole
was
dodging
him
and
asserted
the
fact
so
violently
that
a
window
in
the
first
storey
was
opened
and
a
head
thrust
out
what
in
the
name
of
heaven
are
you
doing
down
there
it
cried
you
drunken
schwein
ca
you
see
the
door
open
in
the
both
fell
heavily
over
a
chair
after
that
with
infinite
labour
he
got
heinz
on
the
sofa
he
did
not
attempt
to
make
a
light
enough
came
in
from
a
for
him
to
see
what
he
was
doing
lying
on
his
face
krafft
groaned
a
little
and
maurice
suddenly
grasped
that
he
was
taken
heinz
was
ill
heinz
his
best
friend
and
he
was
doing
nothing
to
help
him
shedding
tears
he
poured
out
a
glass
of
water
he
believed
he
was
putting
the
carafe
safely
back
on
the
table
but
it
dropped
with
a
crash
to
the
floor
he
was
afraid
frau
schulz
would
come
in
and
said
in
a
loud
voice
it
that
fellow
there
he
dead
drunk
beastly
drunk
krafft
would
not
drink
the
water
and
in
the
attempt
to
force
him
it
was
spilled
over
him
he
stirred
uneasily
put
up
his
arms
and
dragged
maurice
down
so
that
the
latter
fell
on
his
knees
beside
the
sofa
he
made
a
few
ineffectual
efforts
to
free
himself
but
one
arm
held
him
like
a
vice
and
in
this
uncomfortable
position
he
went
to
sleep
part
ii
o
viva
morte
e
dilettoso
male
petrarch
i
the
following
morning
towards
twelve
a
note
from
madeleine
was
handed
to
maurice
in
it
she
begged
him
to
account
to
schwarz
for
her
absence
from
the
rehearsal
of
a
trio
which
was
to
have
taken
place
at
two
go
and
explain
that
it
is
quite
impossible
for
me
to
come
she
wrote
louise
is
very
ill
the
doctor
is
afraid
of
brain
fever
i
am
rushing
off
this
moment
to
see
about
a
nurse
and
shall
stay
till
one
comes
he
read
the
words
mechanically
without
taking
in
their
meaning
from
the
paper
his
eyes
roved
round
the
room
he
saw
the
tumbled
unopened
bed
from
which
he
had
just
risen
the
traces
of
his
boots
on
the
coverings
he
could
not
remember
how
he
had
come
there
his
last
recollection
was
of
being
turned
out
of
krafft
room
in
what
seemed
to
be
still
the
middle
of
the
night
since
getting
home
he
must
have
slept
a
dead
sleep
ill
brain
fever
he
repeated
to
himself
and
his
mind
strove
to
pierce
the
significance
of
the
words
what
had
happened
why
should
she
be
ill
a
racking
uneasiness
seized
him
and
would
not
let
him
rest
his
inclination
was
to
lay
his
aching
head
on
the
pillow
again
but
this
was
out
of
the
question
and
so
though
he
seldom
braved
frau
krause
he
now
boldly
went
to
her
with
a
request
to
warm
up
his
coffee
when
he
had
drunk
it
and
bathed
his
head
he
felt
considerably
better
but
he
still
could
not
call
to
mind
what
had
occurred
the
previous
evening
was
blurred
in
its
details
he
only
had
a
sense
of
oppression
when
he
thought
of
it
as
of
something
that
had
threatened
and
still
did
he
was
glad
to
have
a
definite
task
before
him
and
went
out
at
once
in
order
to
catch
schwarz
before
he
left
the
conservatorium
but
it
was
too
late
the
master
door
was
locked
it
was
a
bright
cold
day
with
strong
sunlight
maurice
eyes
ached
and
he
shrank
from
the
wind
at
every
corner
instead
of
going
home
he
went
to
room
and
sat
down
to
wait
for
her
she
had
evidently
been
away
since
early
morning
the
piano
was
dusty
and
unopened
the
blind
at
the
head
of
it
had
not
been
drawn
up
it
was
a
pleasant
dusk
he
put
his
arms
on
the
table
his
head
on
his
arms
and
in
spite
of
his
anxiety
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
he
was
wakened
by
madeleine
entrance
it
was
three
she
came
bustling
in
took
off
her
hat
laid
it
on
the
piano
and
at
once
drew
up
the
blind
she
was
not
surprised
to
find
him
there
but
exclaimed
at
his
appearance
good
gracious
maurice
how
dreadful
you
look
are
you
ill
he
hastened
to
reassure
her
and
she
was
a
little
put
out
at
her
wasted
sympathy
well
no
wonder
i
sure
after
the
doings
there
were
last
night
a
pretty
way
to
behave
and
that
you
should
have
mixed
yourself
up
in
it
as
you
did
i
would
have
believed
it
of
you
how
i
know
my
dear
boy
it
the
talk
of
the
place
her
words
called
up
to
him
a
more
lucid
remembrance
of
the
past
evening
than
he
had
yet
been
capable
of
in
his
eagerness
to
recollect
everything
he
changed
colour
and
looked
away
madeleine
put
his
confusion
down
to
another
cause
never
mind
it
over
now
and
we
wo
say
any
more
about
it
sit
still
and
i
make
you
some
tea
that
will
do
your
head
good
for
you
have
a
splitting
headache
have
you
i
shall
be
glad
of
some
myself
too
after
all
the
running
about
i
had
this
morning
i
quite
worn
out
when
she
heard
that
he
had
had
no
dinner
she
sent
for
bread
and
sausage
and
was
so
busy
and
unsettled
that
only
when
she
sat
down
with
her
cup
before
her
did
he
get
a
chance
to
say
what
is
it
madeleine
is
she
very
ill
madeleine
shrugged
her
shoulders
yes
she
is
ill
enough
it
not
easy
to
say
what
the
matter
is
though
the
doctor
is
to
see
her
again
this
evening
and
i
found
a
nurse
then
she
is
not
going
away
he
did
not
mean
to
say
the
words
aloud
they
escaped
him
against
his
will
his
companion
raised
her
eyebrows
filling
her
forehead
with
wrinkles
going
away
she
echoed
i
should
say
not
my
dear
maurice
what
is
more
it
turns
out
she
had
an
idea
he
was
going
either
what
do
you
say
to
that
she
flushed
with
sincere
indignation
not
an
idea
until
yesterday
my
lord
had
the
intention
of
sneaking
off
without
a
word
and
of
leaving
her
to
find
it
out
for
herself
oh
it
an
abominable
affair
altogether
and
has
been
from
beginning
to
end
there
much
about
louise
as
you
know
that
i
do
approve
of
and
i
think
she
has
behaved
weakly
not
to
call
it
by
a
harder
name
all
through
but
now
she
has
my
entire
sympathy
the
poor
girl
is
in
a
pitiable
state
is
she
dangerously
ill
well
i
do
think
she
die
of
it
exactly
though
it
might
be
better
for
her
if
she
did
na
let
me
fill
up
your
cup
and
eat
something
more
oh
he
is
no
words
are
bad
enough
for
him
though
honestly
speaking
i
think
we
might
have
been
prepared
for
something
of
this
kind
all
along
it
seems
he
made
his
arrangements
for
going
on
the
quiet
frau
schaefele
advanced
him
the
money
for
of
course
he
has
nothing
of
his
own
but
what
condition
do
you
think
the
old
wretch
made
that
he
should
break
with
louise
furst
has
told
me
all
about
it
i
went
to
him
at
once
this
morning
she
was
always
jealous
of
louise
though
to
him
she
only
talked
of
the
holiness
of
art
and
the
artist
calling
and
the
danger
of
letting
domestic
ties
entangle
you
and
rubbish
of
that
kind
i
believe
she
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
that
he
did
marry
louise
long
ago
well
however
that
may
be
he
now
let
himself
be
persuaded
easily
enough
he
was
hearing
on
all
sides
that
he
had
been
here
too
long
and
candidly
i
think
he
was
beginning
to
feel
louise
a
drag
on
him
i
know
of
late
they
were
not
getting
on
well
together
but
to
be
such
a
coward
and
a
weakling
to
slink
off
in
this
fashion
of
course
when
it
came
to
the
last
he
was
simply
afraid
of
her
and
of
the
scene
she
would
make
him
bravery
has
as
little
room
in
his
soul
as
honesty
or
manliness
he
would
always
prefer
a
exit
such
things
excite
a
man
do
you
know
and
ruffle
the
necessary
artistic
composure
she
laughed
scornfully
however
glad
to
say
he
did
escape
after
all
everything
went
well
till
yesterday
afternoon
when
louise
who
was
as
unsuspecting
as
a
child
heard
of
it
from
some
one
they
say
it
was
krafft
without
thinking
twice
you
know
her
or
rather
you
do
she
went
straight
to
schilsky
and
confronted
him
i
ca
tell
you
what
took
place
between
them
but
i
can
imagine
something
of
it
for
when
louise
lets
herself
go
she
knows
no
bounds
and
this
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
to
her
madeleine
rose
blew
out
the
flame
of
the
and
refilled
the
teapot
fraulein
grunhut
her
landlady
heard
her
go
out
yesterday
afternoon
but
did
hear
her
come
in
so
it
must
have
been
late
in
the
evening
louise
hates
to
be
pried
on
and
the
old
woman
is
lazy
so
she
go
to
her
room
till
about
eight
this
morning
when
she
took
in
the
hot
water
then
she
found
louise
stretched
on
the
floor
just
as
she
had
come
in
last
night
her
hat
lying
beside
her
she
was
conscious
and
her
eyes
were
open
but
she
was
stiff
and
cold
and
would
speak
or
move
grunhut
could
do
anything
with
her
and
was
mortally
afraid
she
sent
for
me
and
between
us
we
got
her
to
bed
and
i
went
for
a
doctor
that
was
at
nine
and
i
have
been
on
my
feet
ever
since
it
awfully
good
of
you
no
she
wo
die
continued
madeleine
meditatively
stirring
her
tea
she
too
robust
a
nature
for
that
but
i
should
wonder
if
it
affected
her
mind
as
i
say
she
knows
no
bounds
and
has
never
learnt
it
has
always
been
all
or
nothing
with
her
and
this
i
must
say
however
foolish
and
wrong
the
whole
thing
was
she
was
devoted
to
schilsky
and
sacrificed
everything
work
money
and
friends
to
her
infatuation
she
lived
only
for
him
and
this
is
a
moral
judgment
on
her
excess
of
any
kind
brings
its
own
punishment
with
it
she
rose
and
smoothed
her
hair
before
the
mirror
and
now
i
really
must
get
to
work
and
make
up
for
the
lost
morning
i
have
touched
a
note
as
for
you
maurice
if
you
take
my
advice
you
go
home
and
go
to
bed
a
good
sleep
is
what
needing
come
if
you
like
for
further
news
i
shall
go
back
after
supper
and
hear
what
the
doctor
says
madeleine
you
a
brick
having
returned
to
his
room
he
lay
face
downwards
on
the
sofa
he
was
sick
at
heart
viewed
in
the
light
of
the
story
he
had
heard
from
madeleine
life
seemed
too
unjust
to
be
endured
it
propounded
riddles
no
one
could
answer
the
vast
output
of
energy
that
composed
it
was
misdirected
on
every
side
was
cruelty
and
suffering
only
the
heartless
and
selfish
those
who
deserved
to
suffer
went
free
he
pressed
the
back
of
his
hand
to
his
tired
eyes
and
despite
her
good
deeds
he
felt
a
sudden
antipathy
to
madeleine
who
on
a
day
like
this
could
take
up
her
ordinary
occupation
in
the
morning
on
awakening
from
a
heavy
sleep
he
was
seized
by
a
fear
lest
louise
should
have
died
in
the
night
through
brooding
on
it
the
fear
became
a
certainty
and
he
went
early
to
madeleine
making
a
detour
through
the
bruderstrasse
where
his
suspicions
were
confirmed
by
the
lowered
blinds
he
had
almost
two
hours
to
wait
it
was
eleven
before
madeleine
returned
her
face
was
so
grave
that
his
heart
seemed
to
stop
beating
but
there
was
no
change
in
the
sick
condition
the
doctor
was
perplexed
and
spoke
of
a
consultation
madeleine
was
returning
at
two
to
relieve
the
nurse
you
are
foolishly
letting
it
upset
you
altogether
she
reproved
maurice
and
it
wo
mend
matters
in
the
least
go
home
and
settle
down
to
work
like
a
sensible
fellow
he
tried
to
follow
madeleine
advice
but
it
was
of
no
use
when
he
had
struggled
on
for
half
an
hour
he
sprang
up
realising
how
monstrous
it
was
that
he
should
be
sitting
there
drilling
his
fingers
getting
the
right
notes
of
a
turn
the
specific
shade
of
a
crescendo
when
not
very
far
away
louise
perhaps
lay
dying
again
he
felt
keenly
the
contrariness
of
life
and
all
the
labour
which
those
around
him
were
expending
on
the
cult
of
hand
and
voice
and
car
seemed
of
a
ludicrous
vanity
compared
with
the
grim
little
tragedy
that
touched
him
so
nearly
and
in
this
mood
he
remained
throughout
the
days
of
suspense
that
now
ensued
he
went
regularly
every
afternoon
to
madeleine
and
if
she
were
not
at
home
waited
till
she
returned
an
hour
two
hours
as
the
case
might
be
this
was
the
vital
moment
of
the
day
when
he
read
her
tidings
from
her
face
at
first
they
were
always
the
same
there
was
no
change
fever
did
not
set
in
but
day
and
night
louise
lay
with
wide
strained
eyes
she
refused
nourishment
and
the
strongest
had
no
effect
then
early
one
morning
for
some
trifling
cause
which
afterwards
no
one
could
recall
she
broke
into
a
convulsive
fit
of
weeping
went
on
till
she
was
exhausted
and
subsequently
fell
asleep
on
the
day
maurice
learnt
that
she
was
out
of
danger
he
walked
deep
into
the
woods
the
news
had
lifted
such
a
load
from
his
mind
that
he
felt
almost
happy
but
before
he
reached
home
again
his
brain
had
begun
to
work
at
matters
which
during
the
period
of
anxiety
it
had
left
untouched
at
first
in
desperation
he
had
been
selfless
enough
to
hope
that
schilsky
would
return
on
learning
what
had
happened
now
however
that
he
had
not
done
so
and
louise
had
passed
safely
through
the
ordeal
maurice
was
ready
to
tremble
lest
anything
should
occur
to
soil
the
robe
of
saintly
suffering
in
which
he
draped
her
he
began
to
take
up
the
steady
routine
of
his
life
again
furst
received
him
with
open
arms
and
no
allusion
was
made
to
the
night
in
the
bruhl
with
the
cessation
of
his
anxiety
a
feeling
of
benevolence
towards
other
people
awakened
in
him
and
when
one
afternoon
schwarz
asked
the
assembled
class
if
no
one
knew
what
had
become
of
krafft
whether
he
was
ill
or
anything
of
the
kind
it
was
maurice
who
volunteered
to
find
out
he
remembered
now
that
he
had
not
seen
krafft
at
the
conservatorium
for
a
week
or
more
frau
schulz
looked
astonished
to
see
him
and
holding
the
door
in
her
hand
made
no
mien
to
let
him
enter
herr
krafft
was
away
she
said
gruffly
had
been
gone
for
about
a
week
she
did
not
know
where
or
why
he
had
left
suddenly
one
morning
without
her
knowledge
and
the
following
day
a
postcard
had
come
from
him
stating
that
all
his
things
were
to
lie
untouched
till
his
return
he
was
so
queer
lately
that
i
be
just
as
pleased
if
he
stayed
away
altogether
she
said
that
all
i
can
tell
you
maybe
you
get
something
more
out
of
her
she
knows
more
than
she
says
anyhow
and
she
pointed
with
her
thumb
at
the
door
of
the
adjoining
pension
maurice
rang
there
and
a
dirty
showed
him
avery
room
at
his
knock
she
opened
the
door
herself
and
first
looked
surprised
then
alarmed
at
seeing
him
what
the
matter
has
anything
happened
she
stammered
like
one
on
the
for
bad
news
then
what
do
you
want
she
asked
in
her
short
unpleasant
way
when
he
had
reassured
her
i
came
up
to
see
heinz
and
they
tell
me
he
is
not
here
and
frau
schulz
sent
me
to
you
schwarz
was
asking
for
him
is
it
true
that
he
has
gone
away
yes
it
true
where
to
will
he
be
away
long
how
should
i
know
she
cried
rudely
am
i
his
keeper
find
out
for
yourself
if
you
must
know
and
the
door
slammed
to
in
his
face
he
mentioned
the
incident
to
madeleine
that
evening
she
looked
strangely
at
him
he
thought
and
abruptly
changed
the
subject
a
day
or
two
later
on
the
strength
of
a
rumour
that
reached
his
ears
he
tackled
furst
and
the
latter
who
up
to
this
time
had
been
of
a
praiseworthy
reticence
let
fall
a
hint
which
made
maurice
look
blank
with
amazement
nevertheless
he
could
not
now
avoid
seeing
certain
incidents
in
his
friendship
with
krafft
under
a
different
aspect
about
a
fortnight
had
elapsed
since
the
beginning
of
louise
illness
she
was
still
obliged
to
keep
her
bed
more
than
once
of
late
madeleine
had
returned
from
her
daily
visit
decidedly
out
of
temper
louise
rubs
me
up
the
wrong
way
she
complained
to
maurice
and
she
is
in
the
least
grateful
for
all
i
done
for
her
i
really
think
she
prefers
having
the
nurse
about
her
to
me
sick
people
often
have
such
fancies
he
consoled
her
louise
shows
hers
a
little
too
plainly
besides
we
have
never
got
on
well
for
long
together
but
one
afternoon
on
coming
in
she
unpinned
her
hat
and
threw
it
on
the
piano
with
a
decisive
haste
that
was
characteristic
of
her
in
anger
that
the
end
i
do
go
back
again
i
not
paid
for
my
services
and
am
under
no
obligation
to
listen
to
such
things
as
louise
said
to
me
enough
is
enough
she
is
well
on
the
mend
and
must
get
on
now
as
best
she
can
i
wash
my
hands
of
the
whole
affair
but
you
surely
not
going
to
take
what
a
sick
person
says
seriously
maurice
exclaimed
in
dismay
how
can
she
possibly
get
on
with
only
those
strangers
about
her
she
not
so
ill
now
she
be
all
right
answered
madeleine
she
had
opened
a
letter
that
was
on
the
table
and
did
not
look
up
as
she
spoke
there
a
limit
to
everything
even
to
my
patience
with
her
rudeness
and
on
returning
the
following
day
he
found
sure
enough
that
true
to
her
word
madeleine
had
not
gone
back
she
maintained
an
obstinate
silence
about
what
had
happened
and
requested
that
he
would
now
let
the
matter
drop
the
truth
was
that
madeleine
conscience
was
by
no
means
easy
she
had
gone
to
see
louise
on
that
particular
afternoon
with
even
more
inconvenience
to
herself
than
usual
on
admitting
her
fraulein
grunhut
had
endeavoured
to
detain
her
in
the
passage
mumbling
and
gesticulating
in
the
way
with
which
madeleine
had
no
patience
it
incited
her
to
answer
the
old
woman
in
a
loud
clear
voice
then
brusquely
putting
her
aside
she
opened
the
door
of
the
sick
girl
room
as
she
did
so
she
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
louise
in
a
flannel
was
standing
at
the
high
tiled
stove
behind
the
door
both
her
arms
were
upraised
and
held
to
it
and
she
leant
her
forehead
against
the
tiles
good
heavens
what
are
you
doing
out
of
bed
cried
madeleine
and
as
she
looked
round
the
room
and
where
is
sister
martha
louise
moved
her
head
so
that
another
spot
of
forehead
came
in
contact
with
the
tiles
and
looked
up
at
madeleine
from
under
her
heavy
lids
without
replying
madeleine
laid
one
by
one
on
the
table
some
small
purchases
she
had
made
on
the
way
there
well
are
you
not
going
to
speak
to
me
she
said
in
a
pleasant
voice
as
she
unbuttoned
her
jacket
or
tell
me
what
i
ask
about
the
sister
there
was
not
a
shade
of
umbrage
in
her
tone
louise
moved
her
head
again
and
looked
away
from
madeleine
to
the
wall
of
the
room
i
have
got
up
she
answered
in
such
a
low
voice
that
madeleine
had
to
pause
in
what
she
was
doing
to
hear
her
because
i
could
not
bear
to
lie
in
bed
any
longer
and
i
sent
the
sister
away
because
oh
because
i
could
endure
having
her
about
me
you
have
sent
sister
martha
away
echoed
madeleine
on
your
own
responsibility
louise
how
absurd
well
i
suppose
i
must
put
on
my
hat
again
and
fetch
her
back
how
can
you
get
on
alone
i
should
like
to
know
really
i
have
no
time
to
come
oftener
than
i
do
i
quite
well
now
i
do
need
anyone
come
get
back
into
bed
like
a
good
girl
and
i
will
make
you
some
tea
said
madeleine
in
the
gently
superior
tone
that
one
uses
to
a
sick
person
to
a
young
child
to
anyone
with
whom
it
is
not
fitting
to
dispute
instead
louise
left
the
stove
and
sat
down
in
a
low
american
where
she
crouched
despondently
i
wish
i
had
died
she
said
in
a
toneless
voice
madeleine
smiled
with
exaggerated
cheerfulness
and
rattled
the
nonsense
you
must
talk
about
dying
now
that
you
are
nearly
well
again
besides
you
know
such
things
are
easily
said
one
does
mean
them
i
wish
i
had
died
why
did
you
let
me
die
repeated
louise
in
the
same
apathetic
way
madeleine
did
not
reply
she
was
cogitating
whether
it
would
be
more
convenient
to
go
after
the
nurse
at
once
and
what
she
ought
to
do
if
she
could
not
get
her
to
come
back
for
louise
would
certainly
have
despatched
her
in
meanwhile
the
latter
had
laid
her
arms
along
the
low
arms
of
the
chair
and
now
sat
gazing
from
one
to
the
other
of
her
hands
in
their
way
these
hands
of
hers
had
acquired
a
kind
of
fame
which
she
had
once
been
vain
of
they
had
been
photographed
a
sculptor
had
modelled
them
for
a
statue
of
antigone
long
slim
and
strong
with
closely
knit
fingers
and
pale
nails
hands
like
those
of
an
adoring
virgin
hands
which
had
an
eloquent
language
all
their
own
but
little
or
no
agility
and
which
were
out
of
place
on
the
keys
of
a
piano
louise
sat
looking
at
them
and
her
face
was
so
changed
the
hollow
setting
of
the
eyes
reminded
perpetually
of
the
bones
beneath
the
lines
were
hammered
black
below
the
eyes
nostrils
and
lips
were
pinched
and
thinned
that
madeleine
secretly
observing
her
remarked
to
herself
that
louise
looked
at
least
ten
years
older
than
before
her
youth
and
with
it
such
freshness
as
she
had
once
had
were
gone
from
her
here
is
your
tea
the
girl
drank
it
slowly
as
if
swallowing
were
an
effort
while
madeleine
went
round
the
room
touching
and
ordering
and
opening
a
window
this
done
she
looked
at
her
watch
i
will
go
now
she
said
and
see
if
i
can
persuade
sister
martha
to
come
back
if
you
have
mortally
offended
her
that
is
louise
started
up
from
her
chair
and
put
her
cup
only
half
emptied
on
the
table
madeleine
please
please
do
i
ca
have
her
back
again
i
am
quite
well
now
there
was
nothing
more
she
could
do
for
me
i
shall
sleep
a
thousand
times
better
at
night
if
she
is
not
here
oh
bring
her
back
again
her
voice
cut
like
a
knife
and
her
hands
were
so
hard
she
trembled
with
excitement
and
was
on
the
brink
of
tears
hush
do
excite
yourself
like
that
said
madeleine
and
tried
to
soothe
her
there
no
need
for
it
if
you
are
really
determined
not
to
have
her
then
she
shall
not
come
and
that
the
end
of
it
not
but
what
i
think
it
foolish
of
you
all
the
same
she
could
not
refrain
from
adding
you
are
still
weak
however
if
you
prefer
it
i
do
my
best
to
run
up
this
evening
to
see
that
you
have
everything
for
the
night
i
do
want
you
either
madeleine
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
her
pity
became
tinged
with
impatience
the
doctor
says
you
must
go
away
somewhere
for
a
change
she
said
as
she
beat
up
the
pillows
and
smoothed
out
the
crumpled
sheets
preparatory
to
coaxing
her
patient
back
to
bed
louise
shook
her
head
but
did
not
speak
a
few
weeks
change
of
air
is
what
you
need
to
set
you
up
again
i
can
not
go
away
nonsense
of
course
you
can
you
do
want
to
be
ill
all
the
winter
i
do
want
to
be
well
madeleine
sniffed
audibly
there
no
reasoning
with
you
when
you
hear
on
all
sides
that
it
for
your
own
good
oh
stop
tormenting
me
cried
louise
raising
a
drawn
face
with
disordered
hair
i
wo
go
away
nothing
will
make
me
i
shall
stay
here
though
i
never
get
well
again
but
why
give
me
one
sensible
reason
for
not
you
ca
yes
if
if
eugen
should
come
back
the
words
could
only
just
be
caught
madeleine
stood
holding
a
sheet
with
both
hands
as
though
she
could
not
believe
her
ears
louise
she
said
at
last
in
a
tone
which
meant
many
things
louise
began
to
cry
and
was
shaken
by
hard
dry
sobs
madeleine
did
not
look
at
her
again
but
went
severely
on
with
her
bedmaking
when
she
had
finished
she
crossed
to
the
washstand
and
poured
out
a
glass
of
water
louise
took
it
humbled
and
submissive
and
gradually
her
sobs
abated
but
now
madeleine
in
place
of
getting
ready
to
leave
as
she
had
intended
sat
down
at
the
centre
table
and
revolved
what
she
felt
it
to
be
her
duty
to
say
when
all
sound
of
crying
had
ceased
she
began
to
speak
persuasively
in
a
quiet
voice
you
have
brought
the
matter
up
yourself
louise
she
said
and
now
the
ice
is
broken
there
are
one
or
two
things
i
should
like
to
say
to
you
first
then
you
have
been
very
ill
far
worse
than
you
know
the
immediate
danger
is
over
now
so
i
can
speak
of
it
but
who
can
tell
what
may
happen
if
you
persist
in
remaining
on
here
by
yourself
in
the
state
you
are
in
louise
did
not
stir
her
face
was
hidden
the
reason
you
give
for
staying
is
not
a
serious
one
i
hope
madeleine
proceeded
cautiously
choosing
her
words
after
all
the
the
precautions
that
were
taken
to
ensure
the
break
it
is
not
all
likely
he
would
think
of
returning
and
louise
she
added
with
warmth
even
though
he
did
suppose
he
did
after
the
way
he
has
behaved
and
his
disgraceful
treatment
of
you
louise
looked
up
for
an
instant
that
is
not
true
she
said
not
true
echoed
madeleine
well
if
you
are
able
to
admire
his
behaviour
if
you
do
consider
it
disgraceful
no
more
than
that
infamous
she
stopped
not
being
able
to
find
a
stronger
epithet
it
is
not
true
said
louise
in
the
same
expressionless
voice
but
now
she
lifted
her
head
and
pressed
the
palms
of
her
hands
together
madeleine
pushed
back
her
chair
as
if
she
were
about
to
rise
then
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
she
said
and
went
on
if
you
are
ready
to
defend
a
man
who
has
acted
towards
you
as
he
has
in
a
way
that
makes
a
respectable
person
blood
boil
there
is
indeed
nothing
more
to
be
said
she
reddened
with
indignation
as
if
it
were
not
bad
enough
for
him
to
go
after
all
you
have
done
for
him
but
that
he
must
do
it
in
such
a
mean
underhand
way
it
enough
to
make
one
sick
the
only
thing
to
compare
with
it
is
his
conduct
on
the
night
before
he
left
do
you
know
pray
that
on
the
last
evening
at
a
kneipe
in
the
goldene
hirsch
he
boasted
of
what
you
had
done
for
him
boasted
about
everything
that
had
happened
between
you
to
a
rowdy
tipsy
crew
more
than
that
he
gave
shameless
details
about
you
going
to
his
room
that
afternoon
it
not
true
it
not
true
repeated
louise
as
if
she
had
got
these
few
words
by
heart
she
rose
from
her
chair
and
leaned
on
it
half
turning
her
back
to
madeleine
and
holding
her
handkerchief
to
her
lips
madeleine
shrugged
her
shoulders
do
you
think
i
should
say
it
if
it
were
she
asked
i
do
invent
scandal
and
you
are
bound
to
hear
it
when
you
go
out
again
he
did
this
and
worse
than
i
choose
to
tell
you
and
if
you
felt
as
you
ought
to
about
it
you
would
never
give
him
another
thought
he
not
worth
it
he
not
worth
any
respectable
person
respectable
burst
in
louise
and
raised
two
blazing
eyes
to
her
companion
face
that
the
second
time
why
do
you
come
here
madeleine
and
talk
like
that
to
me
he
did
what
he
was
obliged
to
that
all
for
i
should
never
have
let
him
go
ca
you
see
how
preposterous
it
is
to
think
that
by
talking
of
respectability
and
unworthiness
you
can
make
me
leave
off
caring
for
him
when
for
months
i
have
lived
for
nothing
else
do
you
think
one
can
change
feelings
so
easily
do
you
understand
that
to
love
a
person
once
is
to
love
him
always
and
altogether
his
faults
as
well
everything
he
does
good
or
bad
no
matter
what
other
people
think
of
it
oh
you
have
never
really
cared
for
anyone
yourself
or
you
would
know
it
it
not
preposterous
at
all
retorted
madeleine
yes
if
he
had
deserved
all
the
affection
you
wasted
on
him
or
if
unhappy
circumstances
had
separated
you
but
that
not
the
case
he
has
behaved
scandalously
without
the
least
attempt
at
shielding
you
he
has
made
you
the
talk
of
the
place
and
you
may
consider
me
narrow
and
prejudiced
but
this
i
must
say
i
am
boundlessly
astonished
at
you
when
he
has
shown
you
as
plainly
as
he
can
that
he
tired
of
you
that
you
should
still
be
ready
to
defend
him
and
have
so
little
proper
pride
that
you
even
say
you
would
take
him
back
louise
turned
on
her
you
would
never
do
that
madeleine
would
you
never
so
far
forget
yourself
as
to
crawl
to
a
man
feet
and
ask
ask
no
implore
forgiveness
for
faults
you
were
not
conscious
of
having
committed
you
would
never
beg
him
to
go
on
loving
you
after
he
had
ceased
to
care
or
think
nothing
on
earth
worth
having
if
he
would
not
or
could
not
as
i
would
as
i
have
done
but
chancing
to
look
at
madeleine
she
grew
quieter
you
would
never
do
that
would
you
she
repeated
and
do
you
know
why
her
words
came
quickly
again
her
voice
shook
with
excitement
because
you
will
never
care
for
anyone
more
than
yourself
it
is
in
you
to
do
it
you
will
go
through
life
tight
on
to
the
end
without
knowing
what
it
is
to
care
for
some
one
oh
but
i
mean
absolutely
unthinkingly
she
broke
down
and
hid
her
face
again
madeleine
had
carried
the
cups
and
saucers
to
a
and
now
put
on
her
hat
and
i
hope
i
never
shall
she
said
forcing
herself
to
speak
calmly
if
i
thought
it
likely
i
should
never
look
at
a
man
again
but
louise
had
not
finished
coming
round
to
the
front
of
the
and
leaning
on
the
table
she
gazed
at
madeleine
with
wild
eyes
while
her
pale
lips
poured
forth
a
kind
of
revenge
for
the
suffering
real
and
imaginary
that
she
had
undergone
at
the
hands
of
this
cooler
nature
and
i
tell
you
why
you
are
doubly
safe
for
you
will
never
be
able
to
make
a
man
care
so
much
that
that
you
are
forced
to
love
him
like
this
in
return
it
is
in
you
to
do
it
i
do
mean
because
plain
there
are
plenty
of
plainer
women
than
you
who
can
make
men
follow
them
no
it
your
nature
your
cold
narrow
egotistic
nature
which
only
lets
you
care
for
things
outside
yourself
in
a
cold
narrow
way
you
will
never
know
what
it
is
to
be
taken
out
of
yourself
taken
and
shaken
till
everything
you
are
familiar
with
falls
away
she
laughed
but
tears
were
near
at
hand
madeleine
had
turned
her
back
on
her
and
stood
buttoning
her
jacket
with
a
red
exasperated
face
i
shall
not
answer
you
she
said
you
have
worked
yourself
into
such
a
state
that
you
do
know
what
you
saying
all
the
same
i
think
you
might
try
to
curb
your
tongue
i
have
done
nothing
to
you
but
be
kind
to
you
kind
to
me
do
you
call
it
kind
to
come
here
and
try
to
set
me
against
the
man
i
love
best
in
the
world
and
who
loves
me
best
too
yes
he
does
he
would
never
have
gone
if
he
had
been
forced
to
if
i
had
been
a
hindrance
to
him
a
drag
on
him
it
makes
me
ashamed
of
my
sex
to
hear
you
say
such
things
that
a
woman
can
so
far
lose
her
pride
as
to
oh
other
women
do
it
in
other
ways
do
you
think
i
have
seen
how
you
have
been
trying
to
make
some
one
here
like
you
doing
your
utmost
without
any
thoughts
of
pride
or
and
how
you
have
failed
yes
failed
and
if
you
do
believe
me
ask
him
yourself
ask
him
who
it
is
that
could
bring
him
to
her
just
by
raising
her
finger
it
to
me
he
would
come
not
to
you
to
me
who
have
never
given
him
look
or
thought
madeleine
paled
then
went
scarlet
that
a
direct
untruth
you
and
not
to
egg
a
man
on
if
you
see
he
admires
you
you
know
every
time
a
looks
at
you
in
the
street
you
feed
on
such
looks
yes
and
return
them
too
i
have
seen
you
my
lady
looking
and
being
looked
at
by
a
stranger
in
a
way
no
decent
woman
for
the
rest
trouble
you
to
mind
your
own
business
whatever
i
do
or
do
do
trust
me
i
shall
at
least
take
care
not
to
make
myself
the
of
the
place
yes
you
have
only
succeeded
in
making
yourself
ridiculous
for
while
you
were
cringing
before
him
and
aspiring
to
die
for
his
sake
he
was
making
love
behind
your
back
to
another
girl
for
the
last
six
months
every
one
knew
it
it
seems
but
you
she
had
spoken
with
unconcealed
anger
and
now
turned
to
leave
the
room
but
louise
was
at
the
door
before
her
and
spread
herself
across
it
that
a
lie
madeleine
of
your
own
making
you
shall
prove
it
to
me
before
you
go
out
of
this
room
how
dare
you
say
such
a
thing
how
dare
you
madeleine
looked
at
her
with
cold
aversion
and
drew
back
to
avoid
touching
her
prove
it
she
echoed
are
his
own
words
not
proof
enough
he
told
the
whole
story
that
night
just
as
he
had
first
told
all
about
you
it
had
been
going
on
for
months
sometimes
you
were
hardly
out
of
his
room
before
the
other
was
in
and
if
you
do
believe
me
ask
the
person
you
so
proud
of
having
attracted
without
raising
your
finger
louise
moved
away
from
the
door
and
went
back
to
the
table
on
which
she
leaned
heavily
all
the
blood
had
left
her
face
and
the
dark
rings
below
her
eyes
stood
out
with
alarming
distinctness
madeleine
felt
a
sudden
compunction
at
what
she
had
done
it
entirely
your
own
fault
that
i
told
you
anything
whatever
about
it
she
said
heartily
annoyed
with
herself
you
had
no
right
to
provoke
me
by
saying
what
you
did
i
declare
louise
to
be
with
you
makes
one
just
like
you
if
it
any
consolation
to
you
to
know
it
he
was
drunk
at
the
time
and
there
a
possibility
it
may
not
be
true
go
away
go
out
of
my
room
cried
louise
and
madeleine
went
without
delay
having
almost
a
physical
sensation
about
her
throat
of
the
slender
hands
stretched
so
threateningly
towards
and
this
unpleasant
feeling
remained
with
her
until
she
turned
the
corner
of
the
street
ii
on
the
afternoon
when
maurice
found
that
madeleine
had
kept
her
word
he
went
home
and
paced
his
room
in
perplexity
he
pictured
louise
lying
helpless
too
weak
to
raise
her
hand
his
brain
went
stupidly
over
the
few
people
to
whom
he
might
turn
for
aid
avery
hill
johanna
cayhill
but
avery
was
occupied
with
her
own
troubles
and
relationship
to
ephie
put
her
out
of
the
question
he
was
thinking
fantastic
thoughts
of
somehow
offering
his
own
services
or
of
even
throwing
himself
on
the
goodness
of
a
person
like
miss
jensen
whose
motherly
form
must
surely
imply
a
corresponding
motherliness
of
heart
when
frau
krause
entered
the
room
bearing
a
letter
which
she
said
had
been
left
for
him
an
hour
or
two
previously
she
carried
a
lamp
in
her
hand
and
eyed
her
restless
lodger
with
suspicion
why
in
the
name
of
goodness
did
you
bring
this
in
when
it
came
he
demanded
he
held
the
unopened
letter
at
arm
length
as
if
he
were
afraid
of
it
frau
krause
bridled
instantly
did
he
think
she
had
nothing
else
to
do
than
to
carry
things
in
and
out
of
his
room
the
letter
had
lain
on
the
chest
of
drawers
in
the
passage
he
could
have
seen
it
for
himself
had
he
troubled
to
look
maurice
waved
her
away
he
was
staring
at
the
envelope
he
believed
he
knew
the
handwriting
his
heart
beat
with
precise
hammerings
he
laid
the
letter
on
the
table
and
took
a
few
turns
in
the
room
before
he
picked
it
up
again
on
examining
it
anew
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
lightly
gummed
envelope
had
been
tampered
with
and
he
made
a
threatening
movement
towards
the
door
then
checked
himself
remembering
that
if
the
letter
were
what
he
believed
it
would
be
written
in
english
he
tore
it
open
destroying
the
envelope
in
his
nervousness
there
was
no
heading
and
it
was
only
a
few
lines
long
i
must
speak
to
you
will
you
come
to
me
this
evening
louise
dufrayer
his
heart
was
thumping
now
he
was
to
go
to
her
she
said
so
herself
to
go
this
moment
for
it
was
evening
already
as
it
was
she
was
perhaps
waiting
for
him
wondering
why
he
did
not
come
he
had
not
shaved
that
day
and
his
first
impulse
was
to
call
for
hot
water
in
the
same
breath
he
gave
up
the
idea
it
was
out
of
the
question
by
the
poor
light
of
the
lamp
and
the
extraordinary
position
of
the
he
made
however
a
hasty
toilet
in
his
best
only
to
colour
at
himself
when
finished
was
there
ever
such
a
fool
as
he
his
act
contained
the
germ
of
an
insult
and
he
rapidly
changed
back
to
his
workaday
wear
all
this
took
time
and
it
was
eight
before
he
rang
the
in
the
bruderstrasse
now
the
landlady
did
not
mistake
him
for
a
possible
thief
but
she
looked
at
him
in
an
unfriendly
way
and
said
grumblingly
that
fraulein
had
been
expecting
him
for
an
hour
or
more
then
she
pointed
to
the
door
of
the
room
and
left
him
to
make
his
way
in
alone
he
knocked
gently
but
no
one
answered
the
old
woman
who
stood
watching
his
movements
signed
to
him
to
enter
and
he
turned
the
handle
the
large
room
was
dark
except
for
the
light
shed
by
a
small
lamp
which
stood
on
the
table
before
the
sofa
from
somewhere
out
of
the
dusk
that
lay
beyond
a
white
figure
rose
and
came
towards
him
louise
was
in
a
crumpled
and
her
hair
was
loosened
from
its
coil
on
her
neck
maurice
saw
so
much
before
she
was
close
beside
him
her
eyes
searching
his
face
oh
you
have
come
she
said
with
a
sigh
as
if
a
load
had
been
lifted
from
her
mind
i
thought
you
were
not
coming
i
only
got
your
note
a
few
minutes
ago
i
i
came
at
once
he
said
and
stammered
as
he
saw
how
greatly
illness
had
changed
her
i
knew
you
would
she
did
not
give
him
her
hand
but
stood
gazing
at
him
and
her
look
was
so
helpless
and
forlorn
that
he
grew
uncomfortable
you
have
been
ill
he
said
to
render
the
pause
that
followed
less
embarrassing
yes
but
i
better
now
she
supported
herself
on
the
table
her
indecision
seemed
to
increase
and
several
seconds
passed
before
she
said
wo
you
sit
down
he
took
one
of
the
stuffed
she
indicated
and
she
went
back
to
the
sofa
again
there
was
silence
with
her
elbows
on
her
knees
her
chin
on
her
two
hands
louise
stared
hard
at
the
pattern
of
the
tablecloth
maurice
sat
stiff
and
erect
waiting
for
her
to
tell
him
why
she
had
summoned
him
you
will
think
it
strange
that
i
should
send
for
you
like
this
when
i
know
you
so
slightly
she
began
at
length
but
since
i
saw
you
last
i
have
been
in
trouble
her
voice
broke
but
her
eyes
remained
fixed
on
the
cloth
and
i
am
quite
alone
i
have
no
one
to
help
me
then
i
thought
of
you
you
were
kind
to
me
once
you
offered
to
help
me
she
paused
and
wound
her
handkerchief
to
a
ball
anything
anything
that
lies
in
my
power
said
maurice
fervently
he
fidgeted
his
hands
round
the
brim
of
his
hat
which
he
was
holding
to
him
wo
you
tell
me
what
it
is
he
asked
after
another
long
break
i
should
be
so
glad
and
grateful
yes
indeed
grateful
if
there
were
anything
i
could
do
for
you
she
met
his
eyes
and
tried
to
say
something
but
no
sound
came
over
her
lips
she
was
trying
to
fasten
her
thoughts
on
what
she
had
to
say
but
in
spite
of
her
efforts
they
eluded
her
for
more
than
hours
she
had
brooded
over
one
idea
the
strain
had
been
too
great
and
now
that
the
moment
had
come
her
strength
deserted
her
she
would
have
liked
to
lay
her
head
on
her
arms
and
sleep
it
almost
seemed
to
her
now
in
the
indifference
of
sheer
fatigue
that
it
did
not
matter
whether
she
spoke
or
not
but
as
she
looked
at
the
young
man
she
became
conscious
of
an
expression
in
his
face
which
made
her
own
grow
hard
i
wo
be
pitied
maurice
turned
very
red
his
heart
had
gone
out
to
her
in
her
distress
and
his
feelings
were
painted
on
his
face
his
discomfiture
at
her
discovery
was
so
palpable
that
it
gave
her
courage
to
go
on
you
were
one
of
those
were
you
not
who
were
present
at
a
certain
cafe
in
the
bruhl
one
evening
three
weeks
ago
it
was
more
of
a
statement
than
a
question
her
eyes
held
him
fast
his
retreating
colour
rose
again
he
had
a
presentiment
of
what
was
coming
then
you
must
have
heard
she
began
quickly
but
left
the
sentence
unended
his
suspicions
took
shape
and
he
made
a
large
vague
gesture
of
dissent
you
heard
all
that
was
said
she
continued
without
paying
any
heed
to
him
you
heard
how
how
some
one
no
how
the
man
i
loved
and
trusted
how
he
boasted
about
my
caring
for
him
and
not
only
that
but
how
before
that
drunken
crowd
he
told
how
i
had
been
to
him
to
his
room
that
afternoon
she
could
not
finish
and
pressed
her
knotted
handkerchief
to
her
lips
maurice
looked
round
him
for
assistance
you
are
mistaken
he
declared
i
heard
nothing
of
the
kind
remember
i
too
was
among
those
in
the
state
you
mention
he
added
as
an
afterthought
lowering
his
voice
that
is
not
it
leaning
forward
she
opened
her
eyes
so
wide
that
he
saw
a
rim
of
white
round
the
brown
of
the
pupils
you
must
also
have
heard
how
all
this
time
behind
my
back
there
was
some
one
else
someone
he
cared
for
when
i
thought
it
was
only
me
the
young
man
coloured
with
her
and
for
her
it
is
not
true
you
have
been
misled
he
said
with
vehemence
and
again
a
flash
of
intuition
suggested
an
afterthought
to
him
can
you
really
believe
it
do
you
think
better
of
him
than
that
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
known
him
louise
gave
him
a
personal
look
a
look
that
belonged
to
him
alone
and
held
a
warm
ray
of
gratitude
then
however
she
went
on
unsparingly
i
want
you
to
tell
me
who
it
was
he
laid
his
hat
on
a
chair
and
used
his
hands
but
if
i
assure
you
it
is
not
true
if
i
give
you
my
word
that
you
have
been
misinformed
who
was
it
what
is
her
name
he
rose
and
went
away
from
the
table
i
knew
him
better
than
you
she
said
slowly
as
he
did
not
speak
you
or
anyone
else
a
hundred
thousand
times
better
and
i
know
it
is
true
still
he
did
not
answer
then
you
wo
tell
me
tell
you
how
can
i
there
nothing
to
tell
i
was
wrong
then
you
have
no
pity
for
me
pity
i
no
pity
he
cried
forgetting
how
a
minute
ago
she
had
resented
his
feeling
it
but
all
the
same
i
ca
tell
you
what
you
ask
me
you
do
realise
what
it
means
putting
a
slur
on
a
young
girl
name
which
has
never
been
touched
directly
he
had
said
this
he
was
aware
of
his
foolishness
but
she
let
the
admission
contained
in
the
words
pass
unnoticed
then
she
is
not
with
him
she
cried
springing
to
her
feet
and
there
was
a
jubilation
in
her
voice
which
she
did
not
attempt
to
suppress
maurice
made
no
answer
but
in
his
face
was
such
a
mixture
of
surprise
and
disconcertion
that
it
was
answer
enough
she
remained
standing
with
her
head
bowed
and
maurice
who
in
his
nervousness
had
gripped
the
back
of
his
chair
held
it
so
tightly
that
it
left
a
furrow
in
his
hand
he
was
looking
into
the
lamp
and
did
not
at
first
see
that
louise
had
raised
her
head
again
and
was
contemplating
him
when
she
had
succeeded
in
making
him
look
at
her
she
sat
down
on
the
sofa
and
drew
the
folds
of
her
to
her
come
and
sit
here
i
want
to
speak
to
you
but
maurice
only
shot
a
quick
glance
at
her
and
did
not
move
she
leaned
forward
in
her
old
position
she
had
pushed
the
heavy
wings
of
hair
up
from
her
forehead
and
this
together
with
her
extreme
pallor
gave
her
face
a
look
of
febrile
intensity
maurice
guest
she
said
slowly
do
you
remember
a
night
last
summer
when
by
chance
you
happened
to
walk
with
me
coming
home
from
the
theatre
or
have
you
perhaps
forgotten
he
shook
his
head
then
do
you
remember
too
what
you
said
to
me
how
since
the
first
time
you
had
seen
me
you
even
knew
where
that
was
i
believe
you
had
thought
about
me
thought
too
much
or
words
to
that
effect
do
you
remember
do
you
think
when
a
man
says
a
thing
like
that
he
forgets
it
asked
maurice
in
a
gruff
voice
he
turned
as
he
spoke
and
looked
down
on
her
with
a
kind
of
pitying
wisdom
if
you
knew
how
often
i
have
reproached
myself
for
it
he
added
there
was
no
need
for
that
she
answered
and
even
smiled
a
little
we
women
never
resent
having
such
things
said
to
us
never
though
it
is
supposed
we
do
and
though
we
must
pretend
to
but
i
remember
too
i
was
in
a
bad
mood
that
night
and
was
angry
with
you
after
all
everything
seemed
to
have
gone
against
me
in
the
theatre
in
oh
no
no
she
cried
as
she
remembrance
of
that
past
night
with
its
alternations
of
pain
and
pleasure
broke
over
her
my
god
maurice
hardly
breathed
for
fear
he
should
remind
her
of
his
presence
when
the
paroxysm
had
passed
she
crossed
to
the
window
the
blinds
had
not
been
drawn
and
leaning
her
forehead
on
the
glass
she
looked
out
into
the
darkness
in
spite
of
his
trouble
of
mind
the
young
man
could
not
but
comment
on
the
ironic
fashion
in
which
fate
was
treating
him
not
once
in
all
the
hours
he
had
spent
on
the
pavement
below
had
louise
come
like
this
to
the
window
now
that
she
did
so
he
was
in
the
room
beside
her
wishing
himself
away
then
with
a
swift
movement
she
came
back
to
him
and
stood
at
his
side
then
it
was
not
true
what
you
said
that
night
true
echoed
maurice
he
instinctively
moved
a
step
away
from
her
and
threw
a
quick
glance
at
the
pale
face
so
near
his
own
if
i
were
to
tell
you
how
much
more
than
that
is
true
you
would
have
anything
more
to
do
with
me
for
the
second
time
she
seemed
to
see
him
and
consider
him
but
he
kept
his
head
turned
stubbornly
away
you
feel
like
that
she
began
in
slow
surprise
to
continue
hurriedly
you
care
for
me
like
that
and
yet
when
i
ask
the
first
and
only
thing
i
shall
ever
ask
of
you
you
wo
do
it
it
is
a
lesson
to
me
i
suppose
not
to
come
to
you
for
help
oh
i
understand
you
men
you
are
all
all
alike
i
would
do
anything
in
the
world
for
you
anything
but
this
she
repeated
his
last
words
after
him
but
i
want
nothing
else
this
i
ca
tell
you
then
you
do
really
care
you
only
think
you
do
if
you
ca
do
this
one
small
thing
for
me
oh
there
is
no
one
else
i
can
turn
to
or
i
would
oh
please
tell
me
you
who
to
care
for
me
you
wo
when
it
comes
to
the
point
a
man
will
do
nothing
nothing
at
all
i
would
cut
off
my
hands
for
you
but
you
are
asking
me
to
do
something
i
think
wrong
wrong
what
is
wrong
and
what
is
right
they
are
only
words
is
it
right
that
i
should
be
left
like
this
thrown
away
like
a
broken
plate
oh
i
shall
not
rest
till
i
know
who
it
was
that
took
him
from
me
and
you
are
the
only
person
who
can
help
me
are
you
not
a
little
sorry
for
me
is
there
nothing
i
can
do
to
make
you
sorry
you
wo
realise
what
you
are
asking
me
to
do
he
spoke
in
a
constrained
voice
for
he
felt
the
impossibility
of
standing
out
much
longer
against
her
louise
caught
the
note
of
yielding
and
taking
his
hand
in
hers
laid
it
against
her
forehead
feel
that
feel
how
it
throbs
and
burns
and
so
it
has
gone
on
for
hours
now
for
days
i
ca
think
or
feel
with
that
fever
in
me
i
must
know
who
it
was
or
i
shall
go
mad
do
torture
me
then
you
too
you
are
good
be
kind
to
me
now
be
my
friend
maurice
guest
maurice
was
vanquished
in
a
low
voice
he
told
her
what
she
wished
to
hear
she
read
the
syllables
from
his
lips
repeated
the
name
slowly
after
him
then
shook
her
head
she
did
not
know
it
letting
his
hand
drop
she
went
back
to
the
sofa
tell
me
everything
you
know
about
her
she
said
imperiously
what
is
she
like
what
is
she
like
what
is
the
colour
of
her
hair
maurice
was
a
poor
hand
at
description
questioned
thus
he
was
not
even
sure
whether
to
call
ephie
pretty
or
not
he
knew
that
she
was
small
and
very
young
but
of
her
hair
he
could
say
little
except
that
it
was
not
black
louise
caught
at
the
detail
not
black
no
not
black
she
cried
he
had
black
enough
here
and
she
ran
her
hands
through
her
own
unruly
hair
there
was
nothing
she
did
not
want
to
know
did
not
try
to
force
from
his
lips
and
a
relentless
impatience
seized
her
at
his
powerlessness
i
must
see
her
for
myself
she
said
at
length
when
he
had
stammered
into
silence
you
must
bring
her
to
me
no
that
you
really
ca
ask
me
to
do
she
came
over
to
him
again
and
took
his
hands
you
will
bring
her
here
afternoon
do
you
think
i
shall
hurt
her
is
she
any
better
than
i
am
oh
do
be
afraid
we
are
not
so
easily
soiled
maurice
demurred
no
more
for
until
i
see
her
i
shall
not
know
i
shall
not
know
she
said
to
herself
when
he
had
pledged
his
word
the
tense
expression
of
her
face
relaxed
her
mouth
drooped
she
lay
back
in
the
and
shut
her
eyes
for
what
seemed
a
long
time
there
was
no
sound
in
the
room
maurice
thought
she
had
fallen
asleep
but
at
his
first
light
movement
she
opened
her
eyes
now
go
she
said
please
go
and
he
obeyed
the
night
was
cold
but
as
he
stood
irresolute
in
the
street
he
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
he
felt
very
perplexed
only
one
thing
was
clear
to
him
he
had
promised
to
bring
ephie
to
see
her
the
next
day
and
however
wrong
it
might
be
the
promise
was
given
and
must
be
kept
but
what
he
now
asked
himself
was
did
not
the
bringing
of
the
child
under
these
circumstances
imply
a
tacit
acknowledgment
that
she
was
seriously
involved
a
fact
which
all
along
he
had
striven
against
admitting
for
after
his
one
encounter
with
ephie
and
schilsky
in
the
woods
that
summer
and
the
first
firing
of
his
suspicions
he
had
seen
nothing
else
to
render
him
uneasy
a
few
weeks
later
ephie
had
gone
to
switzerland
and
on
her
return
in
september
or
almost
directly
afterwards
three
or
four
days
at
most
schilsky
had
taken
his
departure
there
had
been
of
course
his
drunken
boasts
to
take
into
account
but
firstly
maurice
had
only
retained
a
hazy
idea
of
their
nature
and
in
the
next
place
the
events
which
had
followed
that
evening
had
been
of
so
much
greater
importance
to
him
that
he
had
had
no
thoughts
to
spare
for
ephie
more
especially
as
he
then
knew
that
schilsky
was
out
of
the
way
but
now
the
whole
affair
rose
vividly
before
his
mind
again
and
in
his
heart
he
knew
that
he
had
always
believed
just
as
louise
believed
in
ephie
guilt
no
guilt
was
too
strong
a
word
yet
however
harmless
the
flirtation
might
have
been
in
itself
it
had
been
carried
on
in
secret
in
an
underhand
way
there
had
been
nothing
straightforward
or
about
it
and
this
alone
was
enough
to
compromise
a
young
girl
the
cayhills
had
been
in
leipzig
again
for
three
weeks
but
so
occupied
had
maurice
been
during
this
time
that
he
had
only
paid
them
one
hasty
call
now
he
felt
that
he
must
see
ephie
at
once
not
only
to
secure
her
word
that
she
would
come
out
with
him
the
following
day
but
also
to
read
from
her
frank
eyes
and
childish
lips
the
assurance
of
her
innocence
or
at
least
the
impossibility
of
her
guilt
but
as
he
walked
to
the
lessingstrasse
he
remembered
without
being
able
to
help
it
all
the
trifles
which
at
one
time
or
another
had
disturbed
his
relations
with
ephie
he
recalled
each
of
the
thin
superficial
untruths
by
means
of
which
she
had
defended
herself
the
day
he
had
met
her
with
schilsky
it
seemed
incredible
to
him
now
that
he
had
not
seen
through
them
instantly
he
called
up
her
pretty
insincere
behaviour
with
the
circle
of
young
men
that
gathered
round
her
the
language
of
signs
by
which
she
had
conversed
with
schilsky
in
the
theatre
he
remembered
the
astounding
ease
with
which
he
had
made
her
acquaintance
in
the
first
case
or
rather
with
which
she
had
made
his
even
the
innocent
kiss
she
had
once
openly
incited
him
to
and
on
the
score
of
which
she
had
been
so
exaggeratedly
angry
this
too
was
summoned
to
bear
witness
against
her
each
of
these
incidents
now
seemed
to
point
to
a
fatal
frivolity
to
a
levity
of
character
which
put
to
a
real
test
would
offer
no
resistance
supper
was
over
in
the
pension
but
only
cayhill
sat
in
her
accustomed
corner
ephie
was
with
the
rest
of
the
boarders
in
the
general
where
johanna
conducted
maurice
boehmer
was
paying
an
evening
visit
as
well
as
a
very
young
american
who
laughed
heh
heh
at
everything
that
was
said
thereby
displaying
two
prominently
gold
teeth
tully
sat
on
a
small
sofa
with
her
arm
round
ephie
waist
they
were
the
centre
of
the
group
and
it
did
not
appear
likely
that
maurice
would
get
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
ephie
in
private
she
was
in
high
spirits
and
had
only
a
saucy
greeting
for
him
he
sat
down
beside
johanna
and
waited
ill
at
ease
soon
his
patience
was
exhausted
rising
he
went
over
to
the
sofa
and
asked
ephie
if
he
might
come
to
take
her
for
a
walk
the
next
afternoon
but
she
would
not
give
him
an
express
promise
she
pouted
after
all
these
weeks
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
to
come
and
see
them
and
then
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
ask
a
favour
of
her
did
he
really
expect
her
to
grant
it
do
ephie
love
do
cried
tully
in
her
sprightly
way
men
are
really
shocking
creatures
and
it
is
our
duty
love
to
keep
them
in
their
place
if
we
do
they
grow
presumptuous
and
she
shot
an
arch
look
at
boehmer
who
returned
it
fingered
his
beard
and
murmured
cruel
cruel
and
even
if
i
wanted
to
go
when
the
time
came
how
do
you
expect
me
to
know
so
long
beforehand
ever
so
many
things
may
happen
before
said
ephie
brilliantly
at
which
tully
laughed
very
much
indeed
and
still
more
at
boehmer
remark
that
it
was
an
ancient
privilege
of
the
ladies
never
to
be
obliged
to
know
their
own
minds
it
a
libel
take
that
you
naughty
boy
she
cried
and
slapped
him
playfully
on
the
hand
ephie
love
how
shall
we
punish
him
he
is
not
to
come
again
for
a
week
answered
ephie
slily
and
at
boehmer
protestations
of
penitence
and
despair
both
she
and
tully
laughed
till
the
tears
stood
in
their
eyes
ephie
all
the
more
extravagantly
because
maurice
stood
unsmiling
before
her
i
ask
this
as
a
direct
favour
ephie
there
something
i
want
to
say
to
you
something
important
he
added
in
a
low
voice
so
that
only
she
could
hear
it
ephie
changed
colour
at
once
and
tried
to
read
his
face
then
i
may
come
at
five
you
will
be
ready
good
night
johanna
followed
him
into
the
passage
and
stood
by
while
he
put
on
his
coat
they
had
used
up
all
their
small
talk
in
the
and
had
nothing
more
to
say
to
each
other
when
however
they
shook
hands
she
observed
impulsively
sometimes
i
wish
we
were
safe
back
home
again
but
maurice
only
said
indeed
and
displayed
no
curiosity
to
know
the
reason
why
after
he
had
gone
ephie
was
livelier
than
before
as
long
as
she
was
being
teased
about
her
pale
importunate
admirer
then
suddenly
she
pleaded
a
headache
and
went
to
her
own
room
johanna
listening
outside
the
door
concluded
from
the
stillness
that
her
sister
was
asleep
but
ephie
heard
johanna
come
and
go
she
could
not
sleep
nor
could
she
get
maurice
words
out
of
her
mind
he
had
something
important
to
say
to
her
what
could
it
be
there
was
only
one
important
subject
in
the
world
for
her
now
and
she
longed
for
the
hour
of
his
visit
longed
hoped
and
was
more
than
half
afraid
iii
since
her
return
to
leipzig
ephie
spirits
had
gone
up
and
down
like
a
barometer
in
spring
in
this
short
time
she
passed
through
more
changes
of
mood
than
in
all
her
previous
life
she
learned
what
uncertainty
meant
and
suspense
and
helplessness
she
caught
at
any
straw
of
hope
and
for
a
day
on
end
would
be
almost
comforted
she
invented
numberless
excuses
for
schilsky
and
rejected
them
one
and
all
for
she
was
quite
in
the
dark
about
his
movements
she
had
not
seen
him
since
her
return
and
could
hear
nothing
of
him
only
the
first
of
the
letters
she
had
written
to
him
from
switzerland
had
elicited
a
reply
and
he
had
left
all
the
notes
she
had
sent
him
since
getting
back
unanswered
her
tully
was
her
only
confidant
and
that
only
in
so
far
as
this
lady
knowing
that
what
she
called
a
little
romance
was
going
on
had
undertaken
to
enclose
any
letters
that
might
arrive
during
ephie
absence
johanna
had
no
suspicions
or
rather
she
had
hitherto
had
none
in
the
course
of
the
past
week
however
it
had
become
plain
even
to
her
blind
sisterly
eyes
that
something
was
the
matter
with
ephie
she
could
still
be
lively
when
she
liked
almost
unnaturally
lively
and
especially
in
the
company
of
tully
and
her
circle
but
with
these
high
spirits
alternated
fits
of
depression
and
once
johanna
had
come
upon
her
in
tears
driven
into
a
corner
ephie
declared
that
herr
becker
had
scolded
her
at
her
lesson
but
johanna
was
not
satisfied
with
this
explanation
for
formerly
the
blame
or
praise
had
left
no
impression
on
her
little
sister
mind
even
worse
than
this
ephie
could
now
on
slight
provocation
be
thoroughly
peevish
a
thing
so
new
in
her
that
it
worried
johanna
most
of
all
the
long
walks
of
the
summer
had
been
given
up
but
ephie
had
adopted
a
way
of
going
in
and
out
of
the
house
just
as
it
pleased
her
without
a
word
to
her
sister
johanna
scrutinised
her
keenly
and
the
result
was
so
disturbing
that
she
resolved
to
broach
the
subject
to
her
mother
on
the
morning
after
maurice
visit
therefore
she
appeared
in
the
with
a
heap
of
undarned
stockings
in
one
hand
her
in
the
other
and
with
a
very
determined
expression
on
her
face
but
the
moment
was
not
a
happy
one
cayhill
was
deep
in
why
paul
ferrol
killed
his
wife
and
would
be
lost
to
her
surroundings
until
the
end
of
the
book
was
reached
had
johanna
been
of
an
observant
turn
of
mind
she
would
have
waited
a
little
for
finding
the
intermediate
portion
of
the
novel
dry
reading
cayhill
was
getting
over
the
pages
at
the
rate
of
three
or
four
a
minute
and
would
soon
have
been
finished
but
johanna
sat
down
at
the
table
and
opened
fire
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
mother
she
said
firmly
cayhill
did
not
even
blink
johanna
drew
several
threads
across
a
hole
she
was
darning
before
she
repeated
in
the
same
decided
tone
do
you
hear
me
mother
there
is
something
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
about
hm
said
cayhill
without
raising
her
eyes
from
the
page
she
heard
johanna
and
was
even
vaguely
distracted
by
her
from
the
web
of
circumstance
that
was
enveloping
her
hero
but
she
believed
from
experience
that
if
she
took
no
notice
of
her
johanna
would
not
persist
what
the
latter
had
to
say
would
only
be
a
reminder
that
it
was
and
no
letters
were
ready
or
that
if
she
did
not
put
on
her
bonnet
and
go
out
for
a
walk
she
would
be
obliged
to
take
another
of
her
that
night
and
cayhill
hated
moral
persuasion
with
all
her
heart
put
down
your
book
mother
please
and
listen
to
me
continued
johanna
without
any
outward
sign
of
impatience
and
as
she
spoke
she
drew
another
stocking
over
her
hand
what
is
the
matter
joan
i
wish
you
would
let
me
be
answered
cayhill
querulously
still
without
looking
up
it
about
ephie
mother
but
you
ca
hear
me
if
you
go
on
reading
i
can
hear
well
enough
said
cayhill
and
turning
a
page
she
lost
herself
to
all
appearance
in
the
next
one
johanna
did
not
reply
and
for
some
minutes
there
was
silence
broken
only
by
the
turning
of
the
leaves
then
compelled
by
something
that
was
stronger
than
herself
cayhill
laid
her
book
on
her
knee
gave
a
loud
sigh
and
glanced
at
johanna
grave
face
you
are
a
nuisance
joan
well
make
haste
now
what
is
it
it
ephie
mother
i
am
not
easy
about
her
lately
i
do
think
she
can
be
well
she
is
so
unlike
herself
really
joan
said
cayhill
laughing
with
an
exaggerated
carelessness
i
think
i
should
be
the
first
to
notice
if
she
were
sick
but
you
like
to
make
yourself
important
that
what
it
is
and
to
have
a
finger
in
every
pie
there
is
nothing
whatever
the
matter
with
the
child
she
not
well
i
sure
persisted
johanna
without
haste
i
have
noticed
it
for
some
time
now
i
think
the
air
here
is
not
agreeing
with
her
i
constantly
hear
it
said
that
this
is
an
enervating
place
i
believe
it
would
be
better
for
her
if
we
went
somewhere
else
for
the
winter
even
if
we
returned
home
nothing
binds
us
and
health
is
the
first
and
chief
go
home
cried
cayhill
and
turned
her
book
over
on
its
face
really
joan
you
are
absurd
because
ephie
finds
it
hard
to
settle
down
again
after
such
a
long
vacation
and
that
all
it
is
you
want
to
rush
off
to
a
fresh
place
when
when
we
are
just
so
comfortably
fixed
here
for
the
winter
and
where
we
have
at
last
gotten
us
a
few
friends
as
for
going
home
why
every
one
would
suppose
we
gone
crazy
we
have
been
away
six
months
yet
and
when
cayhill
is
coming
over
to
fetch
us
back
and
and
everything
she
spoke
with
heat
for
she
knew
from
experience
that
what
her
elder
daughter
resolved
on
was
likely
to
be
carried
through
that
is
all
very
well
mother
continued
johanna
unmoved
but
i
do
think
your
arguments
are
sound
if
we
find
that
ephie
is
really
sick
and
needs
a
change
arguments
not
sound
what
big
words
you
love
to
use
joan
you
let
ephie
be
she
grows
prettier
every
day
and
she
a
favourite
wherever
she
goes
that
another
thing
her
head
is
being
turned
and
she
will
soon
be
quite
spoilt
she
begins
to
like
the
fuss
and
attention
so
well
that
you
had
your
chances
too
joan
you
need
be
jealous
johanna
had
heard
this
remark
too
often
to
be
sensitive
to
it
when
it
comes
to
serious
as
you
call
them
no
one
will
be
more
pleased
for
ephie
or
more
interested
than
i
but
this
is
something
different
you
see
that
yourself
mother
i
am
sure
these
young
men
who
come
about
the
house
are
so
foolish
and
immature
and
they
have
such
different
ideas
of
things
from
ourselves
they
think
so
so
johanna
hesitated
for
a
word
so
laxly
on
earnest
subjects
and
it
is
telling
on
ephie
look
for
instance
at
dove
i
do
want
to
say
anything
against
him
in
particular
he
is
really
more
serious
than
the
rest
but
for
some
time
now
he
has
been
making
himself
ridiculous
johanna
had
blushed
for
dove
on
the
occasion
of
his
last
visit
no
one
could
be
more
in
earnest
than
he
is
but
ephie
only
makes
fun
of
him
in
a
heartless
way
she
wo
see
what
a
grave
matter
it
is
to
him
cayhill
laughed
not
at
all
displeased
young
people
will
be
young
people
you
ca
put
old
heads
on
young
shoulders
joan
or
shut
them
up
in
separate
houses
ephie
is
an
extremely
pretty
girl
and
it
will
be
the
same
wherever
we
as
for
young
dove
he
knows
well
enough
that
nothing
can
come
of
it
and
if
he
chooses
to
continue
his
attentions
why
he
must
take
the
consequences
that
all
absurd
a
boy
and
girl
flirtation
and
to
make
so
much
of
it
a
mountain
of
a
molehill
as
usual
and
half
the
time
you
only
imagine
things
and
do
see
what
is
going
on
under
your
very
nose
anyone
but
you
sure
would
find
more
to
object
to
in
the
way
young
guest
behaves
than
dove
maurice
guest
said
johanna
and
laid
her
hands
with
stocking
and
needle
on
the
table
yes
maurice
guest
repeated
cayhill
with
complacent
mockery
do
you
think
no
one
has
eyes
but
yourself
no
joan
you
not
sharp
enough
just
look
at
the
way
he
went
on
last
night
every
one
but
you
could
see
what
was
the
matter
with
him
tully
told
me
about
it
afterwards
why
he
never
took
his
eyes
off
her
oh
i
sure
you
are
mistaken
said
johanna
earnestly
and
was
silent
from
sheer
surprise
he
has
been
here
so
seldom
of
late
she
added
after
a
pause
thinking
aloud
just
for
that
very
reason
replied
cayhill
with
the
same
air
of
wisdom
a
young
man
stays
away
if
he
sees
that
his
feelings
are
not
returned
or
if
he
has
no
position
to
and
another
thing
i
tell
you
joan
though
you
do
think
yourself
so
clever
you
do
need
to
worry
if
ephie
is
odd
and
fidgety
sometimes
just
now
at
her
age
it
only
to
be
expected
you
know
very
well
what
i
mean
all
girls
go
through
the
same
thing
you
did
yourself
after
this
she
took
up
her
book
again
having
she
knew
successfully
silenced
her
daughter
who
on
matters
of
this
nature
was
extremely
sensitive
johanna
went
methodically
on
with
her
darning
but
the
new
idea
which
her
mother
had
dropped
into
her
mind
took
root
and
grew
strange
that
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
before
dove
state
of
mind
had
been
patent
from
the
first
but
she
had
had
no
suspicions
of
maurice
guest
his
manner
with
ephie
had
hitherto
been
that
of
a
brother
he
had
never
behaved
like
the
rest
yet
when
she
looked
back
on
his
visit
of
the
previous
evening
she
could
not
but
be
struck
by
the
strangeness
of
his
demeanour
his
distracted
silence
his
efforts
to
speak
to
ephie
alone
and
the
expression
with
which
he
had
watched
her
and
ephie
what
of
her
now
that
johanna
thought
of
it
a
change
had
also
come
over
ephie
mode
of
treating
maurice
the
gay
insouciance
of
the
early
days
had
given
place
to
the
pert
flippancy
which
only
the
night
before
had
so
pained
her
sister
what
had
brought
about
this
change
was
it
pique
was
ephie
chafing
in
secret
at
his
prolonged
absences
and
was
she
anxious
to
conceal
it
from
him
johanna
gathered
up
her
work
to
go
to
her
own
room
and
think
the
matter
out
in
private
in
the
passage
she
ran
into
the
arms
of
tully
whom
she
disliked
for
ever
since
coming
to
the
pension
this
lady
had
carried
on
a
kind
of
cult
with
ephie
which
was
distasteful
in
the
extreme
to
johanna
oh
miss
cayhill
she
now
exclaimed
i
was
just
groping
my
way
it
is
indeed
groping
is
it
not
to
your
where
is
your
sister
i
want
so
much
to
ask
her
if
she
will
have
tea
with
me
this
afternoon
i
am
expecting
a
few
friends
and
should
be
so
glad
if
she
would
join
us
ephie
is
practising
tully
said
johanna
in
her
coolest
tone
and
i
can
not
have
her
disturbed
she
is
so
very
very
diligent
said
tully
with
enthusiasm
i
always
remark
to
myself
on
hearing
her
how
very
idle
a
life
like
mine
is
in
comparison
i
am
able
to
do
so
little
just
a
mere
trifle
here
and
there
a
little
atom
of
good
one
might
say
i
have
no
and
you
too
dear
miss
cayhill
so
studious
so
clever
i
hear
of
you
on
every
side
and
letting
her
eyes
rest
on
head
she
wondered
why
the
girl
wore
her
hair
so
unbecomingly
johanna
did
not
respond
if
only
you
would
let
your
hair
grow
it
would
make
such
a
difference
to
your
appearance
said
tully
suddenly
with
disconcerting
outspokenness
johanna
drew
herself
up
thanks
she
said
i
have
always
worn
my
hair
like
this
and
at
my
age
have
no
intention
of
altering
it
and
leaving
tully
protesting
vehemently
at
such
false
modesty
she
went
past
her
into
her
own
room
and
shut
the
door
she
sat
down
by
the
window
to
sew
but
her
hands
soon
fell
to
her
lap
and
with
her
eyes
on
the
backs
of
the
neighbouring
houses
she
continued
her
interrupted
reflections
first
though
she
threw
a
quick
sarcastic
on
her
mother
and
herself
as
so
often
before
when
she
had
wanted
to
pin
her
mother
attention
to
a
subject
the
centre
of
interest
had
shifted
in
spite
of
her
efforts
and
they
had
ended
far
from
where
they
had
begun
further
she
johanna
had
a
way
when
it
came
to
the
point
not
of
asking
advice
or
of
faithfully
discussing
a
question
but
of
emphatically
giving
her
opinion
or
of
stating
what
she
considered
to
be
the
facts
of
the
case
from
an
odd
mixture
of
experience
and
johanna
had
however
acquired
a
certain
faith
in
her
mother
opinions
these
blind
instinctive
hits
and
guesses
which
often
proved
right
where
johanna
carefully
drawn
conclusions
failed
here
once
more
her
mother
idea
had
broken
in
upon
her
like
a
flash
of
light
even
though
she
could
not
immediately
bring
herself
to
accept
it
maurice
and
ephie
she
could
not
reconcile
the
one
with
the
other
yet
what
if
the
child
were
fretting
what
if
he
did
not
care
a
pang
shot
through
her
at
the
thought
that
any
outsider
should
have
the
power
to
make
ephie
suffer
oh
she
would
make
him
care
she
would
talk
to
him
as
he
had
never
been
talked
to
in
his
life
before
the
sisters
rooms
were
connected
by
a
door
and
gradually
in
spite
of
her
preoccupation
johanna
could
not
but
become
aware
how
brokenly
ephie
was
practising
coaxing
encouragement
and
sometimes
even
severity
were
all
it
is
true
necessary
to
pilot
ephie
through
the
two
hours
that
were
her
daily
task
but
as
idle
as
she
had
never
been
what
could
she
be
doing
johanna
listened
intently
but
not
a
sound
came
from
the
room
and
impelled
by
a
curiosity
to
observe
her
sister
in
a
new
light
she
rose
and
opened
the
door
ephie
was
standing
with
her
back
to
it
staring
out
of
the
window
and
supporting
herself
on
the
table
by
her
violin
which
she
held
by
the
neck
at
johanna
entrance
she
started
grew
very
red
and
hastily
raised
the
instrument
to
her
shoulder
what
are
you
doing
ephie
you
are
wasting
a
great
deal
of
time
said
johanna
in
the
tone
of
mild
reproof
that
came
natural
to
her
in
speaking
to
her
little
sister
is
anything
the
matter
if
you
do
practice
better
than
this
you
wo
have
the
etude
ready
by
friday
and
herr
becker
will
make
you
take
it
again
for
the
third
time
he
can
if
he
likes
i
guess
i
do
care
said
ephie
nonchalantly
and
seizing
the
opportunity
offered
for
a
break
she
sat
down
and
laid
bow
and
fiddle
on
the
table
have
you
remembered
everything
he
pointed
out
to
you
at
your
last
lesson
asked
johanna
going
over
to
the
and
peering
at
the
pages
with
her
shortsighted
eyes
let
me
see
what
was
it
now
something
about
this
here
and
the
fingering
in
this
position
ephie
laughed
old
joan
what
do
you
know
about
it
not
much
dear
i
admit
said
johanna
pleasantly
but
try
and
master
it
like
a
good
girl
so
you
can
get
rid
of
it
and
go
on
to
something
else
ephie
sat
back
clasped
her
hands
behind
her
head
and
gave
a
long
sigh
yes
to
the
next
one
she
said
oh
if
you
only
knew
how
sick
i
am
of
them
joan
the
next
wo
be
a
bit
better
than
this
they
are
all
alike
a
whole
book
of
them
johanna
looked
down
at
the
little
figure
with
the
plump
white
arms
and
discontented
expression
and
she
tried
to
find
in
the
childish
face
something
she
had
previously
not
seen
there
are
you
tired
of
studying
ephie
she
asked
would
you
like
to
leave
off
and
go
away
go
away
from
leipzig
where
to
ephie
did
not
unclasp
her
hands
but
her
eyes
grew
vigilant
oh
there
are
plenty
of
other
places
child
dresden
or
weimar
or
stuttgart
where
you
could
take
lessons
just
as
well
or
if
you
are
tired
of
studying
altogether
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
go
on
with
it
we
can
return
home
any
day
sometimes
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
we
did
you
have
not
been
yourself
lately
dear
i
do
think
you
are
very
well
i
not
myself
not
well
what
rubbish
you
talk
joan
i
am
quite
well
and
wish
you
would
tease
me
i
guess
you
want
to
go
away
yourself
you
are
tired
of
being
here
but
nothing
shall
induce
me
to
go
i
love
old
leipzig
and
i
still
have
heaps
to
learn
before
i
leave
off
i
do
even
know
whether
i
shall
be
ready
by
spring
it
all
depends
and
now
joan
go
away
she
took
up
her
violin
and
put
it
on
her
shoulder
now
it
you
who
are
wasting
time
how
can
i
practise
when
you
stand
there
talking
johanna
was
silent
but
after
this
she
did
not
venture
to
mention
maurice
name
and
she
had
turned
to
leave
the
room
when
she
remembered
her
meeting
with
tully
i
would
rather
you
did
not
go
to
tea
ephie
she
ended
and
then
regretted
having
said
it
that
another
of
your
silly
prejudices
joan
i
want
to
know
why
you
feel
so
about
tully
i
think
she
lovely
not
that
i
have
gone
anyway
i
promised
maurice
to
go
for
a
walk
with
him
at
five
i
know
what
her
friends
means
too
just
boehmer
and
she
asks
me
along
so
people
will
think
he
comes
to
see
me
and
not
her
he
sits
there
and
twirls
his
moustache
and
makes
eyes
at
her
and
she
makes
them
back
i
only
for
show
no
i
should
have
gone
i
ca
bear
boehmer
he
such
a
goat
you
did
think
that
as
long
as
he
came
to
see
us
expostulated
johanna
no
of
course
not
but
so
he
only
comes
to
see
her
i
and
sometimes
joan
why
it
just
embarrassing
the
last
afternoon
why
he
had
a
headache
or
something
and
she
made
him
lie
on
the
sofa
with
a
rug
over
him
so
she
could
bathe
his
head
with
i
guess
she
going
to
marry
him
and
i
not
the
only
one
the
other
day
i
heard
frau
walter
and
frau
von
baerle
talking
in
the
after
dinner
and
they
said
the
little
english
widow
was
very
heiratslustig
ephie
i
do
like
to
hear
you
repeat
such
foolish
gossip
said
johanna
in
real
distress
and
if
you
can
understand
and
remember
a
word
like
that
you
might
really
take
more
pains
with
your
german
it
is
not
impossible
for
you
to
learn
you
see
joan
the
preacher
and
joan
the
teacher
and
joan
the
wise
old
bird
sang
ephie
and
laughed
i
think
tully
is
real
kind
she
going
to
show
me
a
new
way
to
do
my
hair
this
style
is
quite
out
in
london
she
says
do
let
her
touch
your
hair
it
could
be
better
than
it
is
said
johanna
quickly
but
ephie
turned
her
head
this
way
and
that
and
considered
herself
in
the
now
that
she
knew
maurice
was
expected
that
afternoon
johanna
awaited
his
arrival
with
impatience
meanwhile
she
believed
she
was
not
wrong
in
thinking
ephie
unusually
excited
at
dinner
where
as
always
the
elderly
boarders
made
a
great
fuss
over
her
her
laughter
was
so
loud
as
to
grate
on
johanna
ear
but
afterwards
in
their
own
a
trifle
sufficed
to
put
her
out
of
temper
a
new
hat
had
been
sent
home
a
hat
which
johanna
had
not
yet
seen
now
that
it
had
come
ephie
was
not
sure
whether
she
liked
it
or
not
and
all
the
cries
of
admiration
her
mother
and
tully
uttered
when
she
put
it
on
were
necessary
to
reassure
her
johanna
was
silent
and
this
unspoken
disapproval
irritated
ephie
why
do
you
say
something
joan
she
cried
crossly
i
suppose
you
think
it
homely
frankly
i
do
care
for
it
much
dear
to
my
mind
it
overtrimmed
this
was
so
precisely
ephie
own
feeling
that
she
was
more
annoyed
than
ever
she
taunted
johanna
with
countrified
tastes
and
in
spite
of
her
mother
comforting
assurances
retired
in
a
pet
to
her
own
room
that
afternoon
as
they
sat
together
at
tea
cayhill
who
for
some
time
had
considered
ephie
fondly
said
i
ca
understand
you
thinking
she
is
well
joan
i
never
saw
her
look
better
ephie
went
crimson
now
what
has
joan
been
saying
about
me
she
asked
angrily
johanna
had
left
the
table
and
was
reading
on
the
sofa
i
only
said
what
i
repeated
to
yourself
ephie
that
i
did
think
you
were
looking
well
just
fancy
said
cayhill
laughing
she
was
saying
we
ought
to
leave
leipzig
and
go
to
some
strange
place
even
back
home
to
america
you
do
want
to
go
away
darling
do
you
no
really
joan
is
too
bad
cried
ephie
with
a
voice
in
which
tears
and
exasperation
struggled
for
the
mastery
she
always
has
some
new
fad
in
her
head
she
ca
leave
us
alone
never
let
her
go
away
so
she
wants
to
i
wo
i
happy
here
i
love
being
here
even
if
you
both
go
away
i
shall
stop
she
got
up
from
the
table
and
went
to
a
window
where
she
stood
biting
her
lips
and
paying
small
attention
to
her
mother
elaborate
protests
that
she
too
had
no
intention
of
being
moved
johanna
did
not
raise
her
eyes
from
her
book
she
could
have
wept
not
only
at
the
spirit
of
rebellious
dislike
which
was
beginning
to
show
more
and
more
clearly
in
everything
ephie
said
but
was
no
one
but
herself
awake
to
the
change
that
was
taking
place
in
the
child
day
by
day
she
would
write
to
her
father
without
delay
and
make
him
insist
on
their
returning
to
america
from
the
moment
maurice
entered
the
room
she
did
not
take
her
eyes
off
him
and
under
her
scrutiny
the
young
man
soon
grew
nervous
he
sat
and
fidgeted
and
found
nothing
to
say
ephie
was
wayward
she
did
not
think
she
wanted
to
go
out
it
looked
like
rain
johanna
refrained
from
interfering
but
maurice
was
most
persistent
he
begged
ephie
not
to
disappoint
him
and
when
this
failed
said
angrily
that
she
had
no
business
to
bring
him
there
for
such
capricious
whims
this
treatment
cowed
ephie
and
she
went
at
once
to
put
on
her
hat
and
jacket
he
wants
to
speak
to
her
and
she
knows
it
and
is
trying
to
avoid
it
said
johanna
to
herself
and
her
heart
beat
fast
for
both
of
them
but
she
was
alone
with
maurice
she
must
not
lose
the
chance
of
sounding
him
a
little
where
do
you
think
of
going
for
a
walk
she
asked
and
her
voice
had
an
odd
tone
to
her
ears
where
oh
to
the
rosental
or
the
scheibenholz
or
along
the
river
anywhere
i
do
know
she
coughed
have
you
noticed
anything
strange
about
ephie
lately
she
is
not
herself
i
afraid
she
is
not
well
he
had
noticed
nothing
but
he
did
not
face
johanna
and
he
held
the
photograph
he
was
looking
at
upside
down
she
leaned
out
of
the
window
to
watch
them
walk
along
the
street
at
this
moment
she
was
fully
convinced
of
the
correctness
of
her
assumption
and
by
the
thought
of
what
might
take
place
within
the
next
hour
she
was
much
disturbed
during
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
she
found
it
impossible
to
settle
to
anything
and
she
wandered
from
one
room
to
another
unable
even
to
read
but
it
struck
six
seven
eight
it
was
and
still
ephie
had
not
come
home
cayhill
grew
anxious
too
and
johanna
strained
her
eyes
watching
the
dark
street
at
nine
and
at
ten
she
was
pacing
the
room
and
at
eleven
after
a
messenger
had
been
sent
to
maurice
lodging
and
had
found
no
one
there
she
buttoned
on
her
to
accompany
one
of
the
servants
to
the
why
did
i
let
her
go
oh
why
did
i
let
her
go
iv
maurice
and
ephie
walked
along
the
lessingstrasse
without
speaking
it
was
a
dull
mild
day
threatening
to
rain
as
it
had
rained
the
whole
of
the
preceding
night
but
ephie
was
not
accustomed
to
be
silent
she
found
the
stillness
disconcerting
and
before
they
had
gone
far
shot
a
furtive
look
at
her
companion
she
did
not
intend
him
to
see
it
but
he
did
and
turned
to
her
he
cleared
his
throat
and
seemed
about
to
speak
then
changed
his
mind
something
in
his
face
as
she
observed
it
more
nearly
made
ephie
change
colour
and
give
an
awkward
laugh
i
asked
you
before
how
you
liked
my
hat
she
said
with
another
attempt
at
the
airiness
which
she
could
not
command
and
you
did
say
i
guess
you
have
looked
at
it
you
in
such
a
hurry
maurice
turned
his
head
but
he
did
not
see
the
hat
instead
he
mentally
answered
a
question
louise
had
put
to
him
the
day
before
and
which
he
had
then
not
known
how
to
meet
yes
ephie
was
pretty
radiantly
pretty
with
the
fresh
unsullied
charm
of
a
flower
just
blown
joan
was
so
stupid
about
it
she
went
on
at
random
her
face
still
wore
its
uncertain
smile
she
said
it
was
overtrimmed
and
and
did
become
me
as
if
she
ever
wore
anything
that
suited
her
but
joan
is
an
old
maid
she
has
a
scrap
of
taste
and
as
for
you
maurice
why
i
just
do
believe
you
know
one
hat
from
another
men
are
so
stupid
again
they
went
forward
in
silence
you
are
tiresome
she
said
at
length
and
looked
at
him
with
a
touch
of
defiance
as
a
schoolgirl
looks
at
the
master
with
whom
she
ventures
to
remonstrate
yes
i
a
dull
companion
knowing
it
does
make
it
any
better
but
she
was
not
really
cross
all
other
feelings
were
swallowed
up
by
the
uneasiness
she
felt
at
his
manner
of
treating
her
where
are
we
going
she
suddenly
demanded
of
him
with
a
little
quick
upward
note
in
her
voice
this
is
not
the
way
to
the
scheibenholz
no
he
had
been
waiting
for
the
question
ephie
he
cleared
his
throat
anew
i
am
taking
you
to
see
a
friend
of
mine
is
that
what
you
brought
me
out
for
then
you
did
want
to
speak
to
me
as
you
said
then
we
not
going
for
a
walk
afterwards
perhaps
it
like
this
some
one
i
know
has
been
very
now
that
she
is
getting
better
she
needs
rousing
and
cheering
up
and
that
kind
of
thing
and
i
said
i
would
bring
you
to
call
on
her
she
knows
you
by
sight
and
would
like
to
know
you
personally
he
added
with
a
lame
effort
at
explanation
is
that
so
said
ephie
with
sudden
indifference
and
her
heart
which
had
begun
to
thump
at
the
mention
of
a
friend
quieted
down
at
once
in
fancy
she
saw
an
elderly
lady
with
shawls
and
a
footstool
who
had
been
attracted
by
her
fresh
young
face
the
same
thing
had
happened
to
her
before
now
however
that
she
knew
the
object
of
their
walk
she
was
greatly
relieved
as
if
a
near
danger
had
been
averted
but
she
had
not
taken
many
steps
forward
before
she
was
telling
herself
that
another
hope
was
gone
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
take
the
matter
into
her
own
hands
it
was
now
or
never
and
simply
a
question
of
courage
maurice
say
do
many
people
go
away
from
here
in
the
fall
leave
the
i
would
say
she
asked
abruptly
i
mean
is
this
a
time
more
people
leave
than
in
spring
maurice
started
he
had
been
lost
in
his
own
thoughts
which
all
centred
round
this
meeting
he
had
weakly
agreed
to
arrange
again
and
again
he
had
tried
to
imagine
how
it
would
fall
out
but
he
did
not
know
louise
well
enough
to
foresee
how
she
would
act
and
the
nearer
the
time
came
the
stronger
grew
his
presentiment
of
trouble
his
chief
remaining
hope
was
that
there
would
be
no
open
speaking
that
schilsky
name
would
not
be
mentioned
and
plump
into
the
midst
of
this
hope
fell
ephie
question
he
turned
on
her
she
coloured
furiously
and
walked
into
a
pool
of
water
and
at
this
moment
everything
was
as
clear
to
maurice
as
though
she
had
said
where
is
be
why
has
he
gone
why
do
you
ask
he
queried
with
unconscious
sharpness
no
easter
is
the
general
time
for
leaving
but
people
who
play
in
the
prufungen
then
sometimes
stay
for
the
summer
term
why
do
you
ask
gracious
maurice
how
tiresome
you
are
must
one
always
say
why
i
only
wanted
to
know
i
missed
people
i
used
to
see
about
that
all
yes
a
number
have
not
come
back
he
was
so
occupied
with
what
they
were
saying
that
he
in
his
turn
stepped
into
a
puddle
splashing
the
water
up
over
her
shoe
ephie
was
extremely
annoyed
look
look
what
you
done
she
cried
showing
him
her
spikey
little
shoe
why
do
you
look
where
you
going
how
clumsy
you
are
and
in
a
sudden
burst
of
illhumour
i
do
know
why
bringing
me
here
it
a
horrid
part
of
the
city
anyway
i
did
have
any
desire
to
come
i
guess
i
turn
back
and
go
home
we
almost
there
now
i
do
care
i
do
want
to
go
but
you
shall
all
the
same
what
the
matter
with
you
that
you
do
know
your
own
mind
for
two
minutes
together
you
did
inquire
if
i
wanted
to
come
you
just
horrid
maurice
and
you
a
capricious
child
he
quickened
his
pace
afraid
she
might
still
escape
him
and
ephie
had
hard
work
to
keep
up
with
him
as
she
trotted
along
a
few
steps
behind
there
arose
in
her
a
strong
feeling
of
resentment
against
maurice
which
was
all
the
stronger
because
she
suspected
that
she
was
on
the
brink
of
hearing
her
worst
suspicions
confirmed
but
she
could
not
afford
to
yield
to
the
feeling
when
the
last
chance
she
had
of
getting
definite
information
was
passing
from
her
knitting
both
hands
firmly
inside
her
muff
she
asked
with
an
earnestness
which
to
one
who
knew
was
fatally
did
anyone
you
were
acquainted
with
leave
maurice
yes
said
the
young
man
at
her
side
with
brusque
determination
he
remained
untouched
by
the
tone
of
appeal
in
which
ephie
put
the
question
for
he
himself
suffered
under
her
continued
hedging
yes
he
said
some
one
did
and
that
was
a
man
called
schilsky
a
tall
fellow
a
violinist
but
he
has
only
just
gone
he
came
back
after
the
vacation
to
settle
his
affairs
and
say
to
his
friends
is
there
anything
else
you
want
to
know
he
regretted
the
words
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
his
mouth
after
all
ephie
was
such
a
child
he
could
not
see
her
face
which
was
hidden
by
the
brim
of
the
big
hat
but
there
was
something
pathetic
in
the
line
of
her
chin
and
the
droop
of
her
arms
and
shoulders
she
seemed
to
shrink
under
his
words
to
grow
smaller
as
he
stood
aside
to
let
her
pass
before
him
through
the
in
the
bruderstrasse
he
had
a
quick
revulsion
of
feeling
instead
of
being
rough
and
cruel
to
her
he
should
have
tried
to
win
her
confidence
with
brotherly
kindness
but
he
had
had
room
in
his
mind
for
nothing
but
the
meeting
with
louise
and
now
there
was
no
more
time
they
were
going
up
the
stairs
all
he
could
do
was
to
say
gently
i
ought
to
tell
you
ephie
that
the
person
we
are
going
to
see
has
been
very
very
ill
and
needs
treating
with
the
utmost
consideration
i
rely
on
your
tact
and
but
ephie
did
not
reply
the
colour
had
left
her
face
and
for
once
the
short
closed
firmly
on
the
lower
one
for
some
minutes
amazed
anger
with
maurice
was
all
she
felt
then
however
came
the
knowledge
of
what
his
words
meant
he
knew
maurice
knew
he
had
seen
through
her
fictions
he
would
tell
on
her
there
would
be
dreadful
scenes
with
joan
there
would
be
reproaches
and
recriminations
she
would
be
locked
up
or
taken
away
as
for
what
lay
beyond
his
assertion
that
schilsky
had
been
there
had
been
and
gone
without
a
word
to
her
that
was
a
sickening
possibility
which
at
present
her
mind
could
not
grasp
she
grew
dizzy
under
these
blows
that
rained
down
on
her
one
after
the
other
and
meanwhile
she
had
to
keep
up
appearances
to
go
on
as
though
nothing
had
happened
when
it
seemed
impossible
even
to
drag
herself
to
the
top
of
the
winding
flight
of
stairs
she
held
her
head
down
there
was
a
peculiar
clicking
in
her
throat
which
she
could
not
master
she
felt
at
every
step
as
if
she
would
have
to
burst
out
crying
at
the
glass
of
the
door
and
at
the
wizened
old
face
that
appeared
behind
it
she
looked
with
unseeing
eyes
and
she
followed
maurice
mechanically
along
the
passage
to
a
door
at
the
end
in
his
agitation
the
young
man
forgot
to
knock
and
as
they
entered
a
figure
sprang
up
from
the
and
made
a
few
impulsive
steps
towards
them
maurice
went
over
to
louise
and
took
her
hand
i
brought
her
he
said
in
a
low
tone
and
with
a
kind
of
appeal
in
voice
and
eyes
which
he
was
not
himself
aware
of
louise
answered
the
look
and
went
on
looking
at
him
as
if
she
were
fearful
of
letting
her
eyes
stray
both
turned
at
an
exclamation
from
ephie
she
was
still
standing
where
maurice
had
left
her
close
beside
the
door
but
her
face
was
flaming
and
her
right
hand
fumbled
with
the
doorhandle
ephie
said
maurice
warningly
he
was
afraid
she
would
turn
the
handle
and
going
over
to
her
took
her
by
the
arm
say
maurice
i
going
home
she
said
under
her
breath
i
stop
here
oh
why
did
you
bring
me
ssh
be
a
good
girl
ephie
he
replied
as
though
speaking
to
a
child
come
with
me
an
inborn
politeness
struggled
with
ephie
dread
i
ca
i
know
her
name
she
whispered
but
she
let
him
draw
her
forward
to
where
louise
was
standing
and
she
held
out
her
hand
miss
she
said
in
a
small
voice
and
waited
for
the
name
to
be
filled
in
louise
had
watched
them
whispering
with
a
stony
fare
but
at
gesture
life
came
into
it
her
eyes
opened
wide
and
drawing
back
from
the
girl
outstretched
hand
yet
without
seeming
to
see
it
she
turned
with
a
hasty
movement
and
went
over
to
the
window
where
she
stood
with
her
back
to
them
this
was
the
last
straw
ephie
dropped
on
a
chair
and
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
burst
into
the
tears
she
had
hitherto
restrained
her
previous
trouble
was
increased
a
hundredfold
for
she
had
recognised
louise
at
once
she
felt
that
she
was
in
a
trap
and
the
person
who
had
entrapped
her
was
maurice
holding
a
tiny
lace
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
she
sobbed
as
though
her
heart
would
break
do
cry
dear
do
cry
said
the
young
man
it
all
right
but
his
thoughts
were
with
louise
he
was
apprehensive
of
what
she
might
do
next
as
if
in
answer
to
his
fear
she
crossed
the
room
ask
her
to
take
her
hands
down
i
want
to
see
her
face
maurice
bent
over
ephie
and
touched
her
shoulder
ephie
dear
do
you
hear
look
up
like
a
good
girl
and
speak
to
miss
dufrayer
but
ephie
shook
off
his
hand
over
her
bowed
head
their
eyes
met
and
the
look
louise
gave
the
young
man
was
cold
and
questioning
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
could
do
nothing
and
retreating
behind
the
he
left
the
two
girls
to
themselves
stand
up
please
said
louise
in
an
unfriendly
voice
and
as
ephie
did
not
obey
she
made
a
movement
to
take
her
by
the
wrists
no
no
do
touch
me
cried
ephie
and
rose
in
spite
of
herself
what
right
have
you
to
speak
to
me
like
this
she
could
say
no
more
for
with
a
quick
unforeseen
movement
louise
took
the
young
girl
face
in
both
hands
and
turned
it
up
and
after
her
first
instinctive
effort
to
draw
back
ephie
kept
still
like
a
fascinated
rabbit
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
dark
face
that
looked
down
at
her
seconds
passed
into
minutes
and
the
minutes
seemed
hours
maurice
watched
on
the
alert
to
intervene
if
necessary
at
the
entrance
of
her
visitors
louise
had
been
unable
to
see
distinctly
so
stupefied
was
she
by
the
thought
that
the
person
on
whom
her
thoughts
had
run
with
a
kind
of
madness
for
more
than
hours
was
actually
in
the
room
beside
her
it
was
just
as
though
a
nightmare
phantom
had
taken
bodily
form
and
then
too
though
she
had
spent
each
of
these
hours
in
picturing
to
herself
what
this
girl
would
be
like
the
reality
was
so
opposed
to
her
imagining
that
at
first
she
could
not
reconcile
the
differences
now
she
forced
herself
to
see
every
line
of
the
face
nothing
escaped
her
she
saw
how
loosened
tendrils
of
hair
on
neck
and
forehead
became
little
curls
saw
the
finely
marked
brows
and
the
dark
blue
veins
at
the
temples
the
pink
and
white
colouring
of
the
cheeks
the
small
nose
modelled
as
if
in
wax
the
fascinating
baby
mouth
with
its
short
like
most
dark
sallow
women
whose
own
brief
freshness
is
past
the
elder
girl
passionately
admired
such
beauty
as
something
belonging
to
a
different
race
from
herself
and
this
was
not
all
as
she
continued
to
look
into
ephie
face
she
ceased
to
be
herself
she
became
the
man
whose
tastes
she
knew
better
than
her
own
she
saw
with
his
eyes
felt
with
his
senses
she
pictured
ephie
face
arch
and
smiling
lifted
to
his
and
she
understood
and
excused
his
weakness
he
had
not
been
able
to
help
what
had
happened
this
was
the
prettiness
that
drew
him
in
the
kind
he
had
invariably
turned
to
look
back
at
in
the
street
something
fair
and
round
adorably
small
and
young
something
to
be
petted
and
protected
that
clung
and
was
childishly
subordinate
for
her
dark
sallowness
for
her
wilful
mastery
he
had
only
had
a
passing
fancy
she
was
not
his
type
and
she
knew
it
but
to
have
known
it
vaguely
when
it
did
not
matter
and
to
know
it
at
a
moment
like
the
present
were
two
different
things
in
a
burst
of
despair
she
let
her
arms
fall
to
her
sides
but
her
insatiable
eyes
gazed
on
and
ephie
though
she
was
now
free
did
not
stir
but
remained
standing
with
her
face
raised
in
a
silly
fascination
and
the
eyes
having
taken
in
the
curves
of
cheeks
and
chin
and
the
soft
white
throat
passed
to
the
rounded
drooping
shoulders
to
the
plumpness
of
the
girlish
figure
embracing
the
whole
body
in
their
devouring
gaze
ephie
went
hot
and
cold
beneath
them
she
felt
as
if
her
clothes
were
being
stripped
from
her
and
she
left
standing
naked
louise
saw
the
changing
colour
and
interpreted
it
in
her
own
way
his
all
his
he
was
not
the
mortal
she
knew
it
only
too
well
to
have
this
flower
within
his
reach
and
not
clutch
at
it
instinctively
as
a
child
clutches
at
sunbeams
it
would
riot
have
been
in
nature
for
him
to
do
otherwise
than
take
greedily
without
reflection
at
the
thought
of
it
a
spasm
of
jealousy
caught
her
by
the
throat
her
hanging
hands
trembled
to
hurt
this
infantile
prettiness
to
spoil
these
lips
that
had
been
kissed
by
his
maurice
was
at
her
side
do
hurt
her
he
said
and
did
not
know
how
the
words
came
to
his
lips
the
spell
was
broken
the
unnatural
expression
died
out
of
her
face
she
was
tired
and
apathetic
hurt
her
she
repeated
faintly
no
do
be
afraid
i
shall
not
hurt
her
but
if
i
beat
her
with
ropes
till
all
my
strength
was
gone
i
could
hurt
her
as
she
has
hurt
me
hush
do
say
such
things
i
i
hurt
you
said
ephie
and
began
to
cry
afresh
how
could
i
i
do
even
know
you
no
you
do
know
me
and
yet
you
have
done
me
the
cruellest
wrong
oh
no
no
sobbed
ephic
no
indeed
he
was
all
i
had
all
i
cared
for
and
you
plotted
and
planned
and
stole
him
from
me
with
your
silly
baby
face
it
not
true
wept
ephie
how
could
i
i
did
know
anything
about
you
he
he
never
spoke
of
you
louise
laughed
oh
i
can
believe
that
and
you
thought
did
you
you
poor
little
fool
that
he
only
cared
for
you
that
was
why
my
name
was
never
mentioned
he
did
need
to
scheme
and
contrive
and
lie
lie
abominably
for
fear
i
should
come
to
hear
what
he
was
doing
no
indeed
sobbed
ephie
never
and
you
no
right
to
say
such
things
of
him
i
no
right
louise
drew
herself
up
no
right
to
say
what
i
like
of
him
are
you
going
to
tell
me
what
i
shall
say
and
what
i
sha
of
the
man
i
loved
yes
and
who
loved
me
too
but
in
a
way
you
understand
you
who
think
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
smile
your
silly
smile
and
spoil
another
person
life
you
did
know
no
of
course
not
did
know
this
was
his
room
as
well
as
mine
look
his
music
is
still
lying
on
the
piano
that
the
chair
he
sat
in
not
many
days
ago
here
she
took
ephie
by
the
shoulder
and
drew
her
behind
the
screen
where
a
small
door
papered
like
the
wall
gave
direct
from
the
a
second
entrance
to
the
room
here
the
door
he
came
in
for
he
came
as
he
liked
whenever
he
chose
it
not
true
it
ca
be
true
said
ephie
and
raised
her
face
defiantly
we
are
engaged
since
the
summer
coming
back
to
marry
me
soon
he
coming
back
to
marry
you
echoed
louise
in
a
blank
voice
coming
back
to
marry
you
she
moved
a
few
steps
away
and
stood
by
the
looking
dazed
as
if
she
did
not
understand
then
she
laughed
ephie
cried
with
renewed
bitterness
i
want
to
go
home
but
maurice
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
her
he
was
watching
louise
with
a
growing
dismay
for
she
continued
to
laugh
in
a
breathless
way
with
a
catch
in
the
throat
which
made
the
laughter
sound
like
sobbing
on
his
approaching
her
she
tried
to
check
herself
but
without
success
she
wiped
her
lips
and
pressed
her
handkerchief
to
them
then
took
the
handkerchief
between
her
teeth
and
bit
it
she
crossed
to
the
window
and
stood
with
her
back
to
the
others
but
she
could
not
stop
laughing
she
went
behind
the
low
broad
screen
that
divided
the
room
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
but
still
she
had
to
laugh
on
she
came
out
again
into
the
other
part
of
the
room
and
saw
maurice
pale
and
concerned
and
ephie
tears
dried
through
pure
fear
but
the
sight
of
these
two
made
her
laugh
more
violently
than
before
she
held
her
face
in
her
hands
and
pressed
her
jaws
together
as
though
she
would
break
them
for
they
shook
with
a
nervous
convulsion
her
whole
body
began
to
shake
with
the
efforts
she
made
at
repression
ephie
cowered
in
her
seat
oh
maurice
let
us
go
i
so
afraid
she
implored
him
do
be
frightened
it
all
right
but
he
was
following
louise
about
the
room
entreating
her
to
regain
the
mastery
of
herself
when
he
did
happen
to
notice
ephie
more
closely
he
said
go
downstairs
and
wait
for
me
there
i
come
soon
ephie
did
not
need
twice
telling
she
turned
and
fled
he
heard
the
bang
behind
her
do
try
to
control
yourself
miss
dufrayer
louise
every
one
in
the
house
will
hear
you
but
she
only
laughed
the
more
and
now
the
merest
trifles
helped
to
increase
the
paroxysm
the
way
maurice
worked
his
hands
ephie
muff
lying
forgotten
on
a
chair
the
landlady
inquisitive
face
peering
in
at
the
door
the
laugh
continued
though
it
had
become
a
kind
of
cackle
a
sound
without
tone
maurice
could
bear
it
no
longer
he
went
up
to
her
and
tried
to
take
her
hands
she
repulsed
him
but
he
was
too
strong
for
her
he
took
both
her
hands
in
his
and
pressed
her
down
on
a
chair
he
was
not
clear
himself
what
to
do
next
but
the
moment
he
touched
her
the
laughter
ceased
she
gasped
for
breath
he
thought
she
would
choke
and
let
her
hands
go
again
she
pressed
them
to
her
throat
her
breath
came
more
and
more
quickly
her
eyes
closed
and
falling
forward
on
her
knees
she
hid
her
face
in
the
cushioned
seat
of
the
sofa
then
the
tears
came
and
what
tears
in
all
his
life
maurice
had
never
heard
crying
like
this
he
moved
as
far
away
from
her
as
he
could
stood
at
the
window
staring
out
and
biting
his
lips
while
she
sobbed
regardless
of
his
presence
with
the
utter
abandon
of
a
child
like
a
child
too
she
wept
rebelliously
unchastenedly
as
he
could
not
have
believed
it
possible
for
a
grown
person
to
cry
such
grief
as
this
so
absolute
a
despair
had
nothing
to
do
with
reason
or
the
reasoning
faculties
and
the
words
were
not
invented
that
would
be
able
to
soothe
it
but
little
by
little
a
change
came
over
her
crying
the
rebellion
died
out
of
it
it
grew
duller
and
more
blunted
hopeless
without
life
her
strength
was
almost
gone
now
however
there
was
another
note
of
childishness
in
it
that
of
complete
exhaustion
which
it
is
so
hard
to
hear
the
tears
rose
to
his
own
eyes
he
would
have
liked
to
go
to
her
to
lay
his
hand
on
her
head
and
treat
her
tenderly
to
make
her
cease
and
be
happy
once
more
but
he
did
not
dare
had
he
done
so
she
might
not
have
repelled
him
for
in
all
intensely
passionate
grief
there
comes
a
moment
of
subsidence
when
the
grief
and
its
origin
are
forgotten
and
the
one
overruling
desire
is
the
desire
to
be
comforted
no
matter
who
the
comforter
and
what
his
means
so
long
as
they
are
masterful
and
strong
she
grew
calmer
and
soon
she
was
only
shaken
at
widening
intervals
by
a
sob
then
these
too
ceased
and
maurice
held
his
breath
but
as
after
a
considerable
time
had
elapsed
she
still
lay
without
making
sound
or
movement
he
crossed
the
room
to
look
at
her
she
was
fast
asleep
half
sitting
half
lying
with
her
head
on
the
cushions
and
the
tears
wet
on
her
cheeks
he
hesitated
between
a
wish
to
see
her
in
a
more
comfortable
position
and
an
unwillingness
to
disturb
her
finally
he
took
an
quilt
from
the
bed
and
wrapped
it
round
her
then
slipped
noiselessly
from
the
room
it
was
past
eight
ephie
ran
down
the
stairs
as
if
a
spectre
were
at
her
heels
and
even
when
in
the
street
did
not
venture
to
slacken
her
speed
although
the
dusk
was
rapidly
passing
into
dark
a
good
deal
of
notice
was
attracted
by
the
sight
of
a
young
girl
running
along
holding
a
handkerchief
to
her
face
and
every
now
and
then
emitting
a
loud
sob
people
stood
and
stared
after
her
and
some
little
boys
ran
with
her
instead
of
dropping
her
pace
when
she
saw
this
ephie
grew
confused
and
ran
more
quickly
than
before
she
had
turned
at
random
on
coming
out
of
the
house
and
she
was
in
a
part
of
the
town
she
did
not
know
in
her
eagerness
to
get
away
from
people
she
took
any
turn
that
offered
and
after
a
time
she
found
that
she
had
crossed
the
river
and
was
on
what
was
almost
a
country
road
a
little
further
off
she
knew
lay
the
woods
if
once
she
were
in
their
shelter
she
would
be
safe
and
without
stopping
to
consider
that
night
was
falling
she
ran
towards
them
at
full
speed
on
the
first
seat
she
came
to
she
sank
breathless
and
exhausted
her
first
sensation
was
one
of
relief
at
being
alone
she
unpinned
and
took
off
the
big
heavy
hat
and
laid
it
on
the
seat
beside
her
in
order
to
be
more
at
her
case
and
then
she
cried
heartily
and
without
precautions
enjoying
to
the
full
the
luxury
of
being
unwatched
and
unheard
since
teatime
she
seemed
to
have
been
fighting
her
tears
exercising
a
that
was
new
to
her
and
very
hard
and
not
alone
oh
no
for
weeks
past
she
had
been
obliged
to
act
a
part
not
even
in
her
bed
at
night
had
she
been
free
to
indulge
her
grief
for
if
she
cried
then
it
made
her
pale
and
next
day
and
exposed
her
to
joan
comments
and
there
were
so
many
things
to
cry
about
all
the
emotional
excitement
of
the
summer
with
its
ups
and
downs
of
hope
and
fear
the
need
of
dissimulation
the
gnawing
uncertainty
caused
by
schilsky
silence
the
growing
sense
of
blankness
and
disappointment
joan
suspicions
discovery
the
knowledge
that
schilsky
had
gone
away
without
a
word
to
her
and
worst
of
all
and
most
inexplicable
the
terrible
visit
of
the
afternoon
at
the
remembrance
of
the
madwoman
she
had
escaped
from
ephie
tears
flowed
with
renewed
vigour
her
handkerchief
was
soaked
and
useless
she
held
her
fur
tippet
across
her
eyes
to
receive
the
tears
as
they
fell
and
when
this
grew
too
wet
she
raised
the
skirt
of
her
dress
to
her
face
not
a
sound
was
to
be
heard
but
her
sobbing
she
was
absolutely
alone
and
she
wept
on
till
those
who
cared
for
her
whose
chief
wish
was
to
keep
grief
from
her
would
hardly
have
recognized
in
her
the
child
they
loved
how
long
she
had
been
there
she
did
not
know
when
she
was
startled
to
her
feet
by
a
loud
rustling
in
the
bushes
behind
her
then
of
a
sudden
she
became
aware
that
it
was
and
that
she
was
all
by
herself
in
the
woods
she
took
to
her
heels
in
a
panic
of
fear
and
did
not
stop
running
till
the
came
into
sight
when
she
was
under
their
friendly
shine
and
could
see
people
walking
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
she
remembered
that
she
had
left
her
hat
lying
on
the
seat
at
this
fresh
misfortune
she
began
to
cry
anew
but
not
for
anything
in
the
world
would
she
have
ventured
back
to
fetch
it
she
crossed
the
pleisse
and
came
to
a
dark
quiet
street
where
few
people
were
and
here
she
wandered
up
and
down
it
was
late
at
home
they
would
be
sitting
at
supper
now
exhausting
themselves
in
conjectures
where
she
could
be
ephie
was
very
hungry
and
at
the
thought
of
the
warmth
and
light
of
the
a
lump
rose
in
her
throat
if
it
had
been
only
her
mother
she
might
have
faced
her
but
joan
home
in
this
plight
at
this
hour
hatless
and
with
swollen
face
to
meet
joan
eyes
and
questions
she
shivered
at
the
idea
moreover
the
whole
pension
would
get
to
know
what
had
happened
to
her
she
would
need
to
bear
inquisitive
looks
and
words
she
would
have
to
explain
or
still
worse
to
invent
and
tell
stories
again
and
of
what
use
were
they
now
when
all
was
over
a
feeling
of
lassitude
overcame
her
an
inability
to
begin
fresh
all
over
he
would
never
put
his
arm
round
her
again
never
come
towards
her
careless
and
smiling
and
call
her
his
little
little
girl
she
sobbed
to
herself
as
she
walked
everything
was
bleak
and
black
and
cheerless
she
would
perhaps
die
of
the
cold
and
then
all
of
them
joan
in
particular
would
be
filled
with
remorse
she
stood
and
looked
at
the
inky
water
of
the
river
between
its
stone
walls
she
had
read
of
people
drowning
themselves
what
if
she
went
down
the
steps
and
threw
herself
in
and
she
feebly
fingered
at
the
gate
but
it
was
locked
and
chained
and
at
the
idea
of
her
warm
soft
body
touching
the
icy
water
at
the
picture
of
herself
lying
drowned
with
dank
hair
or
like
the
christian
martyr
floating
away
on
the
surface
at
the
thought
of
their
grief
of
him
wringing
his
hands
over
her
corpse
she
was
so
moved
that
she
wept
aloud
again
and
almost
ran
to
be
out
of
temptation
way
it
had
begun
to
drizzle
oh
how
tired
she
was
and
she
was
obliged
constantly
to
dodge
impertinently
staring
men
in
a
long
wide
street
she
entered
a
that
was
not
quite
so
dark
as
the
others
and
sat
down
on
the
bottom
step
of
the
stairs
here
she
must
have
dozed
for
she
was
roused
by
angry
voices
on
the
floor
above
it
sounded
like
some
one
who
was
drunk
and
she
fled
trembling
back
to
the
street
a
neighbouring
clock
struck
ten
at
this
time
of
night
she
could
not
go
home
even
though
she
wished
to
she
was
wandering
the
streets
like
any
outcast
late
at
night
without
a
hat
and
her
condition
of
hatlessness
she
felt
to
be
the
chief
stigma
but
she
was
starving
with
hunger
and
so
tired
that
she
could
scarcely
drag
one
foot
after
the
other
oh
what
would
they
say
if
they
knew
what
their
poor
little
ephie
was
enduring
her
mother
joan
maurice
the
thought
of
him
came
to
her
like
a
ray
of
light
it
was
to
maurice
she
would
turn
he
would
be
good
to
her
and
help
her
he
had
always
been
kind
to
her
till
this
afternoon
and
he
knew
what
had
happened
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
oh
maurice
maurice
she
knew
his
address
if
she
could
but
find
the
street
a
droschke
passed
and
she
tried
to
hail
it
but
she
did
not
like
to
advance
too
far
out
of
the
shadow
on
account
of
her
bare
head
finally
plucking
up
courage
she
inquired
the
way
of
a
woman
who
had
eyed
her
with
an
inquisitive
stare
it
turned
out
that
the
braustrasse
was
just
round
the
corner
she
had
perhaps
been
in
the
street
already
without
knowing
it
and
now
she
found
it
and
the
house
without
difficulty
the
was
still
open
or
she
would
never
have
been
bold
enough
to
ring
the
stair
was
poorly
lighted
and
full
of
unsavoury
smells
in
her
agitation
ephie
rang
on
a
wrong
floor
and
a
strange
man
answered
her
timid
inquiry
she
climbed
a
flight
higher
and
rang
again
there
was
a
long
and
ominous
pause
in
which
her
heart
beat
fast
if
maurice
did
not
live
here
either
she
would
drop
where
she
stood
she
was
about
to
ring
a
second
time
when
felt
slippers
and
an
oil
lamp
moved
along
the
passage
the
glass
window
was
opened
and
a
woman
face
peered
out
at
her
yes
herr
guest
lived
there
certainly
said
frau
krause
divided
between
curiosity
and
indignation
at
having
to
rise
from
bed
and
she
held
the
lamp
above
her
head
in
order
to
see
ephie
better
but
he
was
not
at
home
and
even
if
he
were
at
this
hour
of
night
the
heavy
words
shuffled
along
giving
the
voracious
eyes
time
to
devour
at
the
thought
that
her
request
might
be
denied
her
ephie
courage
took
its
last
leap
why
i
must
see
him
i
have
something
important
to
tell
him
could
i
not
wait
she
urged
in
her
broken
german
feeling
unspeakably
small
and
forlorn
and
yielding
to
a
desire
to
examine
more
nearly
the
bare
damp
head
and
costly
furs
frau
krause
allowed
the
girl
to
pass
before
her
into
maurice
room
she
loitered
as
long
as
she
could
over
lighting
the
lamp
that
stood
on
the
table
and
meanwhile
threw
repeated
glances
at
ephie
who
having
given
one
look
round
the
shabby
room
sank
into
a
corner
of
the
sofa
and
hid
her
face
the
coarse
browed
woman
in
petticoat
and
seemed
to
her
capable
of
robbery
or
murder
and
so
frau
krause
unwillingly
withdrew
to
await
further
developments
outside
the
holy
herr
guest
was
a
deep
one
after
all
when
maurice
entered
shortly
before
eleven
ephie
started
up
from
a
broken
sleep
he
came
in
pale
and
disturbed
for
frau
krause
had
met
him
in
the
passage
with
angry
mutterings
about
a
frauenzimmer
in
his
room
and
his
thoughts
had
at
once
leaped
fearfully
to
louise
when
he
saw
ephie
he
uttered
a
loud
exclamation
of
surprise
good
lord
ephie
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
here
she
sprang
at
his
hands
and
caught
her
breath
hysterically
oh
morry
you
come
at
last
oh
i
thought
you
would
never
come
where
have
you
been
oh
morry
help
me
help
me
or
i
shall
die
whatever
is
the
matter
what
are
you
doing
here
at
his
perturbed
amazement
she
burst
into
tears
still
clinging
fast
to
his
hands
he
led
her
back
to
the
sofa
from
which
she
had
sprung
hush
hush
do
cry
like
that
what
the
matter
child
tell
me
what
it
is
at
once
and
let
me
help
you
oh
yes
morry
help
me
help
me
there
no
one
else
i
did
know
where
to
go
oh
what
shall
i
do
her
own
words
sounded
so
pathetic
that
she
sobbed
piteously
maurice
stroked
her
hand
and
waited
for
her
to
grow
quieter
but
now
that
she
had
laid
the
responsibility
of
herself
on
other
shoulders
ephie
was
quite
unnerved
after
the
dark
and
fearful
wanderings
of
the
evening
to
be
beside
some
one
who
knew
who
would
take
care
of
her
who
would
tell
her
what
to
do
she
sobbed
and
sobbed
only
with
perseverance
did
maurice
draw
from
her
word
by
word
an
account
of
where
she
had
been
that
evening
broken
by
such
cries
as
oh
what
shall
i
do
i
ca
ever
go
home
again
ever
and
i
lost
my
hat
oh
morry
morry
and
i
did
know
he
had
gone
away
and
it
was
true
what
i
said
that
he
was
coming
back
to
marry
me
i
only
said
it
to
spite
her
because
she
said
such
dreadful
things
to
me
but
we
were
engaged
all
the
same
he
said
he
would
come
to
new
york
to
marry
me
and
now
oh
dear
oh
morry
then
he
really
promised
to
marry
you
did
he
yes
oh
yes
everything
was
fixed
the
last
day
i
was
there
she
wept
but
i
did
know
he
was
going
away
he
never
said
a
word
about
it
oh
what
shall
i
do
go
after
him
and
bring
him
back
morry
he
must
come
back
he
ca
leave
me
like
this
he
ca
oh
no
indeed
you
do
mean
to
say
you
went
to
see
him
ephie
alone
at
his
room
queried
maurice
slowly
and
he
did
not
know
how
sternly
when
how
often
tell
me
everything
this
is
no
time
for
fibbing
but
he
could
make
little
of
ephie
sobbed
and
hazy
version
of
the
story
she
herself
could
not
remember
clearly
now
the
impressions
of
the
last
few
hours
had
been
so
intense
as
to
obliterate
much
of
what
had
gone
before
i
thought
i
would
drown
myself
but
the
water
was
so
black
oh
why
did
you
take
me
to
that
dreadful
woman
did
you
hear
what
she
said
it
was
true
was
it
oh
it
ca
be
it
was
quite
true
ephie
what
he
told
you
was
true
he
never
really
cared
for
anyone
but
her
they
were
were
engaged
for
years
at
this
she
wept
so
that
he
was
afraid
frau
krause
would
come
in
and
interfere
you
must
control
yourself
crying
wo
alter
things
now
if
you
had
been
frank
and
candid
with
us
it
would
never
have
happened
this
was
the
only
reproach
he
could
make
her
what
came
after
was
business
not
his
and
now
i
going
to
take
you
home
it
nearly
twelve
think
of
the
state
your
mother
and
sister
will
be
in
about
you
but
at
the
mention
of
johanna
ephie
flung
herself
on
the
sofa
again
and
beat
the
cushions
with
her
hands
not
joan
not
joan
she
wailed
no
i
wo
go
home
what
will
she
say
to
me
oh
i
am
so
frightened
she
kill
me
i
know
she
will
and
at
maurice
confident
assurance
that
johanna
would
have
nothing
but
love
and
sympathy
for
her
she
shook
her
head
i
know
joan
never
forgive
me
morry
let
me
stay
with
you
you
always
been
kind
to
me
oh
do
send
me
away
do
be
a
silly
child
ephie
you
know
yourself
you
ca
stay
here
but
he
gave
up
urging
her
coaxed
her
to
lie
down
and
sat
beside
her
stroking
her
hair
as
he
said
no
more
she
gradually
ceased
to
sob
and
in
what
seemed
to
the
young
man
an
incredibly
short
time
he
heard
from
her
breathing
that
she
was
asleep
he
covered
her
up
and
stood
a
sheet
of
music
before
the
lamp
to
shade
her
eyes
in
the
passage
he
ran
up
against
frau
krause
whom
he
charged
to
prevent
ephie
in
the
event
of
her
attempting
to
leave
the
house
buttoning
up
his
he
hastened
through
the
mistlike
rain
to
fetch
johanna
there
was
a
light
in
every
window
of
the
pension
in
the
lessingstrasse
the
and
both
doors
of
the
flat
stood
open
as
he
mounted
the
stairs
a
confused
sound
of
voices
struck
his
car
and
when
he
entered
the
passage
he
heard
cayhill
crying
noisily
johanna
came
out
to
him
at
once
she
was
in
hat
and
cloak
she
listened
stonily
to
his
statement
that
ephie
was
safe
at
his
lodgings
and
put
no
questions
but
on
her
returning
to
the
sobs
stopped
abruptly
and
several
women
spoke
at
once
johanna
preserved
her
uncompromising
attitude
as
they
walked
the
midnight
streets
but
as
maurice
made
no
mien
to
explain
matters
further
she
so
far
conquered
her
aversion
as
to
ask
what
have
you
done
to
her
the
young
man
consternation
at
this
view
of
the
case
was
so
evident
that
even
she
felt
the
need
of
wording
her
question
differently
answer
me
what
is
ephie
doing
at
your
rooms
maurice
cleared
his
throat
it
a
long
and
unpleasant
story
miss
cayhill
and
i
afraid
i
must
tell
it
from
the
you
suspect
i
fear
that
well
that
ephie
had
a
fancy
for
some
one
here
at
these
words
which
were
very
different
from
those
she
had
expected
johanna
eyed
him
in
astonishment
a
fancy
she
repeated
incredulously
what
do
you
mean
even
more
an
infatuation
said
maurice
with
deliberation
and
for
some
one
i
daresay
you
have
never
even
heard
of
a
a
man
here
a
violinist
called
schilsky
the
elaborate
fabric
she
had
that
day
reared
fell
together
about
johanna
ears
she
stared
at
maurice
as
if
she
doubted
his
sanity
and
she
continued
to
listen
with
the
same
icy
air
of
disbelief
to
his
stammered
and
ineffectual
narrative
until
he
said
that
he
believed
it
had
been
going
on
since
summer
at
this
johanna
laughed
aloud
that
is
quite
impossible
she
said
i
knew
everything
ephie
did
and
everywhere
she
went
she
met
him
nearly
every
day
they
exchanged
letters
and
it
is
impossible
repeated
johanna
with
vehemence
but
less
and
a
sort
of
engagement
seems
to
have
existed
between
them
and
you
knew
this
and
never
said
a
word
to
me
i
did
know
not
till
i
only
suspected
something
once
long
ago
and
i
could
i
mean
one
ca
say
a
thing
like
that
without
being
quite
sure
but
here
he
broke
down
conscious
as
never
before
of
the
negligence
he
had
been
guilty
of
towards
ephie
and
johanna
was
not
likely
to
spare
him
there
was
indeed
a
bitter
antagonism
to
his
conduct
in
the
tone
in
which
she
said
i
stood
to
ephie
in
a
place
you
might
have
warned
me
oh
you
might
indeed
they
walked
on
in
silence
a
hard
resentful
silence
then
johanna
put
the
question
he
was
expecting
to
hear
and
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
maurice
took
up
the
thread
of
his
narrative
again
telling
how
ephie
had
waited
vainly
for
news
since
returning
from
switzerland
and
how
she
had
only
learnt
that
afternoon
that
schilsky
had
been
in
leipzig
and
had
gone
away
again
without
seeing
her
or
letting
her
know
that
he
did
not
intend
to
return
and
how
did
she
hear
it
at
a
friend
house
what
friend
a
friend
of
mine
a
no
i
had
better
be
frank
with
you
the
girl
this
fellow
was
engaged
to
for
a
year
or
more
and
ephie
did
not
know
that
he
shook
his
head
but
you
knew
and
yet
took
her
there
it
was
a
hopeless
job
to
try
to
exonerate
himself
yes
there
were
reasons
i
could
help
it
in
fact
but
i
afraid
i
should
not
be
able
to
make
you
understand
no
never
retorted
johanna
and
squared
her
shoulders
but
there
was
more
to
be
said
she
had
worse
to
learn
before
ephie
was
handed
over
to
her
care
and
ephie
has
been
very
foolish
he
began
anew
without
looking
at
her
it
seems
from
what
she
has
told
me
tonight
that
she
has
been
to
see
this
man
been
at
his
rooms
more
than
once
at
first
he
was
certain
johanna
did
not
grasp
the
meaning
of
what
he
said
she
turned
a
blank
face
curiously
to
him
but
a
moment
later
she
gave
a
low
cry
and
hardly
able
to
form
the
words
for
excitement
asked
who
what
what
kind
of
a
man
was
he
this
schilsky
rotten
said
maurice
and
she
did
not
press
him
further
he
heard
her
breath
coming
quickly
and
saw
the
kind
of
stiffening
that
went
through
her
body
but
she
kept
silence
and
did
not
speak
again
till
they
were
almost
at
his
then
she
said
in
a
voice
that
was
hoarse
with
feeling
it
has
been
all
my
fault
i
did
not
take
proper
care
of
her
i
was
blind
and
foolish
and
i
shall
never
be
able
to
forgive
myself
for
it
never
but
that
ephic
my
little
ephie
the
child
i
that
ephie
could
could
do
a
thing
like
this
her
voice
tailed
off
in
a
sob
maurice
struck
matches
to
light
her
up
the
dark
staircase
and
the
condition
of
the
stairs
the
disagreeable
smells
the
poverty
of
wall
and
door
revealed
made
johanna
heart
sink
still
further
to
surroundings
such
as
these
had
ephie
accustomed
herself
they
entered
without
noise
everything
was
just
as
maurice
had
left
it
except
that
the
lamp
had
burned
too
high
and
filled
the
room
with
its
fumes
as
johanna
paused
undecided
what
to
do
ephie
started
up
and
at
the
sight
of
her
sister
burst
into
loud
cries
of
fear
hiding
her
face
she
sobbed
so
alarmingly
that
johanna
did
not
venture
to
approach
her
she
remained
standing
beside
the
table
one
thin
ungloved
hand
resting
on
it
while
maurice
bent
over
ephie
and
tried
to
soothe
her
please
fetch
a
droschke
johanna
said
grimly
as
ephie
sobs
showed
no
signs
of
abating
and
when
after
a
lengthy
search
in
the
night
maurice
returned
she
was
standing
in
the
same
position
staring
with
drawn
unblinking
eyes
at
the
smoky
lamp
which
no
one
had
thought
of
lowering
ephie
was
still
crying
and
only
maurice
might
go
near
her
he
coaxed
her
to
rise
wrapped
his
rug
round
her
and
carried
her
more
than
he
led
her
down
the
stairs
be
good
enough
to
drive
home
with
us
said
johanna
and
so
he
sat
with
his
arm
round
ephie
who
pressed
her
face
against
his
shoulder
while
the
droschke
jolted
over
the
cobbled
streets
and
johanna
held
herself
pale
and
erect
on
the
opposite
seat
she
mounted
the
stairs
in
front
of
them
ephie
was
limp
and
heavy
going
up
but
no
sooner
did
she
catch
sight
of
cayhill
than
with
a
cry
she
rushed
from
the
young
man
side
and
threw
herself
into
her
mother
arms
oh
mummy
mummy
downstairs
in
the
street
maurice
found
the
waiting
for
his
fare
it
only
amounted
to
a
couple
of
marks
and
it
was
no
doubt
a
just
retribution
for
what
had
happened
that
he
should
be
obliged
to
lay
it
out
but
none
the
less
it
seemed
like
the
last
straw
the
last
dismal
touch
in
a
day
of
forlorn
discomfort
a
few
weeks
later
a
great
variety
of
and
saratogas
blocked
the
corridor
of
the
pension
the
addresses
they
bore
were
in
johanna
small
pointed
handwriting
on
this
the
last
afternoon
of
the
cayhills
stay
in
leipzig
maurice
saw
johanna
again
for
the
first
time
she
had
had
her
hands
full
in
the
woods
on
that
damp
october
night
and
on
her
subsequent
wanderings
ephie
had
caught
a
severe
cold
and
the
doctor
had
feared
an
inflammation
of
the
lungs
this
had
been
staved
off
but
there
was
also
it
seemed
a
latent
weakness
of
the
chest
hitherto
unsuspected
which
kept
them
anxious
ephie
still
had
a
dry
grating
cough
which
was
troublesome
at
night
and
left
her
tired
and
fretful
by
day
they
were
travelling
direct
to
the
south
of
france
where
they
intended
to
remain
until
she
had
quite
recovered
her
strength
maurice
sat
beside
johanna
on
the
deep
sofa
where
he
and
ephie
had
worked
at
harmony
together
but
the
windows
of
the
room
were
shut
now
and
the
room
itself
looked
unfamiliar
for
it
had
been
stripped
of
all
the
trifles
and
fancy
things
that
had
given
it
such
a
comfortable
air
and
was
only
the
bare
room
once
more
johanna
was
as
as
of
old
a
trifle
paler
a
trifle
thinner
of
lip
she
told
him
that
they
intended
leaving
quietly
the
next
morning
without
partings
or
farewells
ephie
was
still
weak
and
the
less
excitement
she
had
to
undergo
the
better
it
would
be
for
her
then
i
shall
not
see
ephie
again
queried
maurice
in
surprise
johanna
thought
not
it
would
only
recall
the
unhappy
night
to
her
memory
besides
she
had
not
asked
to
see
him
as
she
no
doubt
would
have
done
had
she
wished
at
this
the
eleventh
hour
johanna
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
tell
maurice
that
ephie
bore
him
an
unalterable
grudge
i
never
want
to
see
him
again
that
was
all
she
said
to
johanna
but
during
her
illness
she
had
brooded
long
over
his
treachery
and
even
if
things
had
come
all
right
in
the
end
she
would
never
have
been
able
to
forgive
his
speaking
to
her
of
schilsky
in
the
way
he
had
done
no
she
was
finished
with
maurice
guest
he
was
too
too
deceitful
for
and
she
cried
bitterly
with
her
face
turned
to
the
wall
the
young
man
could
not
but
somewhat
lamely
agree
with
johanna
that
it
was
better
to
let
the
matter
end
thus
for
he
felt
that
towards
the
cayhills
he
had
been
guilty
of
a
breach
of
trust
such
as
it
is
difficult
to
forgive
at
the
same
time
he
was
humanly
hurt
that
ephie
would
not
even
say
to
him
he
asked
their
further
plans
and
learnt
that
as
soon
as
ephie
was
well
again
they
would
sail
for
new
york
my
father
has
cabled
twice
for
us
johanna
manner
was
uncompromisingly
dry
and
short
after
her
last
words
there
was
a
long
pause
and
maurice
made
a
movement
to
rise
but
she
put
out
her
hand
and
detained
him
there
is
something
i
should
like
to
say
to
you
and
thereupon
with
the
abruptness
of
a
nervous
person
when
i
have
seen
my
sister
and
mother
safe
back
i
intend
leaving
home
myself
i
am
going
to
harvard
maurice
realised
that
the
girl
was
telling
him
a
fact
of
considerable
importance
to
herself
and
did
his
best
to
look
interested
really
that
always
been
a
wish
of
yours
has
it
yes
johanna
coloured
hesitated
as
he
had
never
known
her
to
do
then
burst
out
and
now
there
is
nothing
in
the
way
of
it
she
drew
her
thumb
across
the
of
a
book
that
was
lying
on
the
table
oh
i
know
what
you
will
say
how
now
that
ephie
has
turned
out
to
be
weak
and
untrustworthy
there
is
all
the
more
reason
for
me
to
remain
with
her
to
look
after
her
but
that
is
not
possible
she
faced
him
sharply
as
though
he
had
contradicted
her
i
am
incapable
of
pretending
to
be
the
same
when
my
feelings
have
changed
and
as
i
told
you
as
i
knew
that
night
i
shall
never
be
able
to
feel
for
ephie
as
i
did
before
i
am
ready
as
i
said
to
take
all
the
blame
for
what
has
happened
i
was
blind
and
careless
but
if
the
care
and
affection
of
years
count
for
nothing
if
i
have
been
so
little
able
to
win
her
confidence
if
indeed
i
have
only
succeeded
in
making
her
dislike
me
by
my
care
of
her
so
that
when
she
is
in
trouble
she
turns
from
me
instead
of
to
me
why
then
i
have
failed
lamentably
in
what
i
had
made
the
chief
duty
of
my
life
besides
she
continued
more
quietly
there
is
another
reason
ephie
is
going
to
fall
a
victim
to
her
nerves
i
see
that
and
my
poor
foolish
mother
is
doing
her
best
to
foster
you
smile
only
because
you
do
not
understand
what
it
means
it
is
no
laughing
matter
if
an
american
woman
once
becomes
conscious
of
her
nerves
then
heaven
help
her
now
i
am
not
of
a
disinterested
enough
nature
to
devote
myself
to
where
there
is
no
real
sickness
and
then
too
my
mother
intends
taking
a
french
maid
back
with
her
and
a
person
of
that
class
will
perform
such
duties
much
more
competently
than
i
she
spoke
with
bitterness
maurice
mumbled
some
words
of
sympathy
wondering
why
she
should
choose
to
say
these
things
to
him
even
at
home
my
place
is
filled
continued
johanna
the
housekeeper
who
was
appointed
during
our
absence
has
been
found
so
satisfactory
that
she
will
continue
in
the
post
after
our
return
everywhere
you
see
i
have
proved
superfluous
there
as
here
i
sure
you
mistaken
said
maurice
with
more
warmth
and
miss
joan
there
something
i
should
like
to
say
if
i
may
do
you
think
you
take
what
has
happened
here
a
little
too
seriously
no
doubt
ephie
behaved
foolishly
but
was
it
after
all
any
more
than
a
girlish
escapade
too
seriously
johanna
turned
her
shortsighted
eyes
on
the
young
man
and
gazed
at
him
almost
pityingly
how
little
oh
how
little
she
said
to
herself
one
mortal
knew
and
could
know
of
another
in
spite
of
the
medium
of
speech
in
spite
of
common
experiences
some
of
the
nights
at
the
beginning
of
ephie
illness
returned
vividly
to
her
mind
nights
when
she
johanna
had
paced
her
room
by
the
hour
filled
with
a
terrible
dread
a
numbing
uncertainty
which
she
would
sooner
have
died
than
have
let
cross
her
lips
she
had
borne
it
quite
alone
this
horrible
fear
her
mother
had
been
told
of
the
whole
affair
only
what
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
her
to
know
and
naturally
enough
the
young
man
who
now
sat
at
her
side
being
a
man
could
not
be
expected
to
understand
but
the
consciousness
of
her
isolation
made
johanna
speak
with
renewed
harshness
too
seriously
she
repeated
oh
i
think
not
the
girlish
escapade
as
you
call
it
was
the
least
of
it
if
that
had
been
all
if
it
had
only
been
her
infatuation
for
some
one
who
was
unworthy
of
her
i
could
have
forgiven
ephie
till
seventy
times
seven
but
after
all
these
years
after
the
way
i
have
loved
her
no
idolised
her
for
her
to
treat
me
as
she
did
do
you
think
it
possible
to
take
that
too
seriously
there
was
no
reason
she
should
not
have
had
her
little
secrets
if
she
had
let
me
see
that
something
was
going
on
which
she
did
not
want
to
tell
me
about
do
you
think
i
should
have
forced
her
and
johanna
spoke
in
all
good
faith
forgetful
of
how
she
had
been
used
to
clip
and
doctor
ephie
sentiments
but
that
she
could
deceive
me
wilfully
and
lie
so
lightly
with
a
smile
when
all
the
time
she
was
living
a
double
life
one
to
my
face
and
one
behind
my
back
that
i
can
not
forgive
something
has
died
in
me
that
i
used
to
feel
for
her
i
could
never
trust
her
again
and
where
there
is
no
trust
there
can
be
no
real
love
she
did
understand
what
she
was
doing
she
is
so
young
just
for
that
reason
so
young
and
so
skilled
in
deceit
that
is
hardest
of
all
even
to
think
of
that
she
could
wear
her
dear
innocent
face
while
behind
it
in
her
brain
were
cold
calculating
thoughts
how
she
could
best
deceive
me
if
there
had
been
but
a
single
sign
to
waken
my
suspicions
then
yes
then
i
could
have
forgiven
her
said
johanna
and
again
forgot
how
often
of
late
she
had
been
puzzled
by
the
subtle
change
in
ephie
if
i
could
just
know
that
in
spite
of
her
efforts
she
had
been
too
candid
to
succeed
she
had
unburdened
herself
and
it
had
been
a
relief
to
her
but
nothing
could
be
helped
or
mended
both
knew
this
and
after
a
few
polite
questions
about
her
future
plans
and
studies
maurice
rose
to
take
his
leave
say
to
them
both
for
me
and
give
ephie
my
love
i
will
i
think
she
will
be
sorry
afterwards
that
she
did
not
see
you
she
has
always
liked
you
then
or
perhaps
it
is
only
auf
wiedersehen
i
hardly
think
so
johanna
had
returned
to
her
usual
sedate
manner
if
i
do
visit
europe
again
it
will
not
be
for
five
or
six
years
at
least
and
that
a
long
time
who
knows
where
i
may
be
by
then
he
held
johanna
hand
in
his
and
saw
her
gauntly
slim
figure
outlined
against
the
bare
it
was
not
likely
that
they
would
ever
meet
again
but
he
could
not
summon
up
any
very
lively
feelings
of
regret
johanna
had
not
touched
him
deeply
she
had
left
him
as
cool
as
he
had
no
doubt
left
her
neither
had
found
the
key
to
the
other
her
chief
attraction
for
him
had
been
her
devotion
to
ephie
and
now
having
been
put
to
the
test
this
was
found
wanting
she
had
been
wounded
in
her
own
pride
and
and
could
not
forgive
at
heart
she
was
no
more
generous
and
unselfish
than
the
rest
he
repeated
farewell
messages
as
he
stood
in
the
passage
johanna
held
the
front
door
open
for
him
and
as
he
went
down
the
stairs
he
heard
it
close
behind
him
with
that
extreme
noiselessness
that
was
characteristic
of
johanna
treatment
of
it
the
following
morning
shortly
after
ten
a
train
steamed
out
of
the
thuringer
bahnhof
carrying
the
cayhills
with
it
the
day
was
misty
and
cheerless
and
none
of
the
three
travellers
turned
her
head
to
give
the
town
a
parting
glance
they
left
unattended
without
flowers
or
other
souvenirs
without
any
of
the
demonstratively
pathetic
farewells
the
waving
of
hats
and
crowding
about
the
which
one
of
the
family
at
least
had
connected
inseverably
with
their
departure
and
thus
ephie
musical
studies
came
to
an
abrupt
and
untimely
end
my
faith
in
women
is
shattered
i
shall
never
believe
in
a
woman
again
dove
paced
the
floor
of
maurice
room
with
long
and
steady
strides
beneath
which
a
particular
board
creaked
at
intervals
his
voice
was
husky
and
the
ruddiness
of
his
cheeks
had
paled
at
the
outset
of
ephie
illness
dove
had
called
every
morning
at
the
pension
to
make
inquiries
and
to
leave
his
regards
but
when
the
story
leaked
out
as
it
soon
did
in
an
exaggerated
and
distorted
form
he
straightway
ceased
his
visits
thus
he
was
wholly
unprepared
for
the
family
hurried
departure
the
news
of
which
was
broken
to
him
by
maurice
dove
was
dumbfounded
not
a
single
sententious
phrase
crossed
his
lips
and
he
remained
unashamed
of
the
moisture
that
dimmed
his
eyes
but
he
maintained
his
bearing
commendably
and
it
was
impossible
not
to
admire
the
upright
manly
air
with
which
he
walked
down
the
street
the
next
day
however
he
returned
and
was
silent
no
longer
he
made
no
secret
of
having
been
hard
hit
just
as
previously
he
had
let
his
friends
into
his
hopes
and
intentions
so
now
every
one
heard
of
his
reverses
he
felt
a
tremendous
need
of
unbosoming
himself
he
had
been
so
sure
of
success
or
at
least
so
unthinking
of
failure
and
the
blow
to
his
selfesteem
was
a
rude
one
maurice
sat
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
tried
to
urge
reason
but
dove
would
not
admit
even
the
possibility
of
his
having
been
mistaken
he
had
received
innumerable
proofs
of
ephie
regard
for
him
remember
how
young
she
was
girls
of
that
age
never
know
their
own
minds
said
maurice
but
dove
was
inclined
to
take
johanna
sterner
view
and
to
cry
so
young
and
so
untender
for
which
he
too
substituted
untrue
and
just
on
this
score
to
deduce
unfavourable
inferences
for
ephie
whole
moral
character
as
maurice
listened
to
him
he
could
not
help
thinking
that
johanna
affection
had
been
of
the
same
nature
as
dove
in
other
words
had
had
a
touch
of
the
masculine
about
it
it
had
existed
only
as
long
as
it
could
guide
and
subordinate
it
denied
to
its
object
any
midget
attempt
at
individual
life
it
set
up
lofty
moral
standards
and
was
implacable
when
a
smaller
frailer
being
found
it
impossible
to
live
up
to
them
at
the
same
time
he
was
sorry
for
dove
who
in
his
blindness
had
laid
himself
open
to
receive
this
snubbing
and
he
listened
patiently
even
a
thought
flattered
by
his
confidence
until
he
learnt
from
madeleine
that
dove
was
making
the
round
of
his
acquaintances
and
behaving
in
the
same
way
to
anyone
who
would
let
him
then
he
found
that
the
openness
with
which
dove
related
his
past
hopes
and
the
marks
of
affection
ephie
had
given
him
bordered
on
indecency
he
said
so
with
a
wrathful
frankness
but
dove
could
not
see
it
in
that
light
and
was
not
offended
as
the
personal
smart
weakened
the
more
serious
question
that
dove
had
to
face
was
what
he
was
going
to
tell
his
relatives
at
home
for
it
now
came
out
that
he
had
represented
the
affair
to
them
as
settled
in
his
perfectly
sincere
optimism
he
had
regarded
himself
as
an
all
but
engaged
man
and
the
point
that
disturbed
him
was
how
to
back
out
with
dignity
yet
without
violating
the
truth
on
which
he
set
great
store
i
sure
he
need
let
that
trouble
him
said
madeleine
on
hearing
of
his
dilemma
he
has
only
to
say
that
he
has
changed
his
mind
which
is
true
enough
this
was
the
conclusion
dove
eventually
came
to
himself
though
not
with
such
unseemly
haste
as
madeleine
having
approached
the
matter
from
all
sides
he
argued
that
it
would
be
more
considerate
to
ephie
to
put
it
in
this
light
than
to
tell
the
story
in
detail
and
consequently
two
elderly
people
in
peterborough
nodded
to
each
other
one
morning
over
the
and
agreed
that
edward
had
done
well
they
had
not
been
much
in
favour
of
the
american
match
but
they
had
trusted
implicitly
in
their
son
good
sense
and
now
as
ever
he
had
acted
in
the
most
becoming
way
he
had
never
given
them
an
uneasiness
since
his
birth
dove
wrote
circumstances
have
arisen
my
dear
parents
which
make
it
incontrovertibly
clear
to
me
that
the
young
lady
to
whom
i
was
paying
my
addresses
when
i
consulted
you
in
summer
and
myself
would
not
have
known
true
happiness
in
our
union
on
more
intimate
acquaintance
it
transpired
that
our
characters
were
totally
unsuited
i
have
therefore
found
it
advisable
to
banish
the
affair
from
my
mind
and
to
devote
myself
wholly
to
my
studies
as
time
passed
and
dove
was
able
to
view
what
had
happened
more
objectively
he
began
to
feel
and
even
to
hint
that
all
things
considered
he
had
had
a
rather
lucky
escape
and
from
this
it
was
not
very
far
to
believing
that
if
he
had
not
just
seen
through
the
whole
affair
from
the
beginning
he
had
at
any
rate
had
some
inkling
of
it
and
now
instead
of
giving
proofs
of
ephie
affection
he
narrated
the
gradual
growth
of
his
suspicions
and
how
these
had
ultimately
been
verified
in
conclusion
he
congratulated
himself
on
having
drawn
back
with
open
eyes
while
there
was
still
time
like
his
cheek
said
madeleine
but
he
could
imagine
himself
into
being
the
shah
of
persia
if
he
sat
down
and
gave
his
mind
to
it
i
do
believe
the
snub
is
going
to
do
him
a
bit
of
good
he
bobs
up
again
like
a
cork
irrepressible
have
you
heard
him
quote
thy
name
is
woman
or
women
could
be
fair
and
yet
not
fond
it
as
good
as
a
play
but
altogether
madeleine
was
very
sharp
of
tongue
since
she
learnt
the
part
maurice
had
played
in
what
for
a
day
was
the
scandal
of
the
colony
she
had
taken
him
to
task
at
once
for
his
lamentable
interference
have
i
warned
you
maurice
not
to
mix
yourself
up
in
affairs
no
good
can
come
of
it
she
breeds
mischief
and
if
that
absurd
child
had
really
drowned
herself
in
the
version
of
the
story
that
had
reached
madeleine
ears
maurice
was
represented
fishing
ephie
bodily
from
the
river
you
would
have
had
to
bear
the
whole
brunt
of
the
blame
it
ought
to
teach
you
a
lesson
for
you
just
the
kind
of
boy
women
will
always
take
advantage
of
a
mean
advantage
you
know
consider
how
you
were
treated
in
this
case
by
both
of
them
they
were
not
a
scrap
grateful
to
you
for
what
you
did
women
never
are
they
only
look
down
on
you
for
letting
them
have
their
own
way
kindness
and
complaisance
do
move
them
a
biceps
and
a
cruel
mouth
that
what
they
want
and
that
all
she
wound
up
with
a
flourish
in
an
extreme
bad
temper
she
sat
one
dull
november
afternoon
at
her
piano
and
continued
to
run
her
fingers
over
the
keys
maurice
leant
on
the
lid
and
listened
to
her
but
they
had
barely
exchanged
a
word
when
there
was
a
light
tap
at
the
door
and
krafft
entered
both
started
at
his
unexpected
appearance
and
madeleine
cried
you
come
in
like
a
ghost
to
frighten
people
out
of
their
wits
krafft
was
buttoned
to
the
chin
in
a
and
looked
pale
and
thin
what
news
from
st
petersburg
queried
madeleine
with
a
certain
asperity
but
maurice
recalled
an
errand
he
had
to
do
in
town
and
on
hearing
this
krafft
who
was
lolling
aimlessly
declared
that
he
would
accompany
him
but
you
only
just
come
expostulated
madeleine
what
in
the
name
of
goodness
did
you
climb
the
stairs
for
he
patted
her
cheek
without
replying
the
young
men
went
away
together
maurice
puffing
somewhat
ostentatiously
at
a
cigarette
the
wind
was
cold
and
krafft
seemed
to
shrink
into
his
ulster
before
it
keeping
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
but
from
time
to
time
he
threw
a
at
his
friend
and
at
length
asked
in
the
tone
of
appeal
which
maurice
found
it
hard
to
withstand
what
the
matter
liebster
why
are
you
so
different
so
changed
the
matter
nothing
that
i
aware
of
said
maurice
and
considered
the
tip
of
his
cigarette
oh
yes
there
is
and
krafft
laid
a
caressing
hand
on
his
companion
arm
you
are
changed
you
not
frank
with
me
i
feel
such
things
at
once
well
how
on
earth
am
i
to
know
when
to
be
frank
with
you
and
when
not
before
you
not
very
long
ago
you
behaved
as
if
you
want
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
me
you
are
changed
and
if
i
not
mistaken
i
know
why
said
krafft
ignoring
his
answer
you
have
been
listening
to
gossip
to
what
my
enemies
say
of
me
i
do
listen
to
gossip
and
i
did
know
you
had
enemies
as
you
call
them
i
and
not
have
enemies
he
flared
up
as
though
maurice
had
affronted
him
my
good
fellow
did
you
ever
bear
of
a
man
worth
his
salt
who
did
have
enemies
it
the
penalty
one
pays
only
the
dolts
and
the
are
friends
with
the
whole
world
no
one
who
has
work
to
do
that
worth
doing
can
avoid
making
enemies
and
who
knows
what
a
friend
is
who
has
an
enemy
to
match
him
it
a
question
of
light
and
shade
theme
and
of
artistic
proportion
he
laughed
in
his
superior
way
but
directly
afterwards
he
dropped
back
into
his
former
humble
tone
but
that
you
my
friend
are
so
ready
to
let
yourself
be
influenced
i
should
not
have
believed
it
of
you
what
i
heard
i
heard
from
furst
and
i
have
no
reason
to
suspect
him
of
of
course
if
you
assure
me
it
was
not
true
that
a
different
thing
he
turned
so
sharply
that
he
sent
a
beautiful
flush
over
krafft
face
come
give
me
your
word
heirtz
and
things
will
be
straight
again
but
krafft
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
his
colour
subsided
as
rapidly
as
it
had
risen
are
you
still
such
an
outsider
he
asked
after
all
this
time
in
my
society
as
to
attach
importance
to
a
word
what
is
a
word
do
you
really
think
it
is
of
any
value
may
i
not
give
it
tonight
and
take
it
back
according
to
the
mood
i
am
in
according
to
whether
i
believe
it
myself
or
not
at
the
moment
you
think
a
thing
must
either
be
true
or
not
true
you
are
wrong
do
you
believe
when
you
answer
a
question
in
the
affirmative
or
the
negative
that
you
are
actually
telling
the
truth
no
my
friend
to
be
perfectly
truthful
one
would
need
to
lose
oneself
in
a
maze
of
explanation
such
as
no
questioner
would
have
the
patience
to
listen
to
one
would
need
to
take
into
account
the
innumerable
threads
that
have
gone
to
making
the
statement
what
it
is
do
you
think
for
instance
if
i
answered
yes
or
no
in
the
present
case
it
would
be
true
if
i
deny
what
you
heard
does
that
tell
you
that
i
have
longed
with
all
my
heart
for
it
to
come
to
pass
or
say
i
admit
it
i
should
need
to
unroll
my
life
before
you
to
make
you
understand
no
there
no
such
thing
as
absolute
truth
if
there
were
the
finest
subtleties
of
existence
would
be
lost
there
is
neither
positive
truth
nor
positive
untruth
life
is
not
so
as
that
and
only
the
grossest
natures
can
be
satisfied
with
a
blunt
yes
or
no
truth
it
is
one
of
the
many
miserable
conventions
the
human
brain
has
tortured
itself
with
and
its
first
principle
is
an
utter
lack
of
the
imaginative
a
dieu
vi
in
the
days
that
followed
maurice
threw
himself
heart
and
soul
into
his
work
he
had
lost
ground
of
late
he
saw
it
plainly
now
after
his
vigorous
start
he
had
quickly
grown
slack
he
was
not
at
the
stage
he
ought
to
be
and
there
was
not
a
doubt
but
that
schwarz
saw
it
too
now
that
he
came
to
think
of
it
he
had
more
than
once
been
aware
of
a
studied
coolness
in
the
master
manner
of
a
rather
ostentatious
indifference
to
the
quality
of
the
work
he
brought
to
the
class
and
this
he
knew
by
hearsay
to
be
schwarz
attitude
towards
those
of
his
pupils
in
whom
his
interest
was
waning
if
he
maurice
wished
to
regain
his
place
in
the
little
pasha
favour
he
must
work
like
a
but
the
fact
was
the
strenuous
industry
to
which
he
now
condemned
himself
was
something
of
a
relaxation
after
the
mental
anxiety
he
had
recently
undergone
this
striking
of
a
black
and
white
keyboard
was
a
pleasant
employment
and
could
be
got
through
no
matter
what
one
and
so
he
rose
early
again
and
did
not
leave
the
house
till
he
had
five
hours
practice
behind
him
wer
sich
der
einsamkeit
ergiebt
ach
der
ist
bald
allein
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
maurice
smiled
to
find
the
words
of
goethe
song
proved
on
himself
if
he
did
not
go
to
see
his
friends
none
of
them
came
to
him
dove
who
was
at
the
stage
of
i
told
you
so
in
the
affair
of
the
cayhills
had
found
fresh
listeners
who
were
more
sympathetic
than
maurice
could
be
expected
to
be
and
madeleine
was
up
to
her
ears
in
work
as
she
phrased
it
with
the
c
minor
beethoven
agility
of
finger
equals
softening
of
the
brain
was
a
frequent
gibe
of
krafft
and
now
and
then
at
the
close
of
a
hard
day
work
maurice
believed
that
the
saying
contained
a
grain
of
truth
opening
both
halves
of
his
window
he
would
lean
out
on
the
sill
too
tired
for
connected
thought
but
when
dusk
fell
he
lay
on
the
sofa
with
his
arms
clasped
under
his
head
his
knees
crossed
in
the
air
at
first
in
his
new
buoyancy
of
spirit
he
was
able
to
keep
foolish
ideas
behind
him
as
well
as
to
put
away
all
recollection
of
the
disagreeable
events
he
had
been
mixed
up
in
of
late
after
having
for
weeks
borne
a
load
that
was
too
heavy
for
him
he
breathed
freely
once
more
the
responsibility
of
taking
care
of
ephie
had
been
removed
from
him
and
this
by
far
outweighed
the
little
that
he
missed
her
the
matter
had
wound
up
too
in
a
fairly
peaceable
way
all
being
considered
things
might
have
been
worse
so
at
first
he
throve
under
his
and
only
now
became
aware
how
great
the
strain
of
the
past
few
weeks
had
been
his
chief
sensation
was
relief
and
also
of
relief
at
being
able
to
feel
relieved
indeed
the
moment
even
came
when
he
thought
it
would
be
possible
calmly
to
accept
the
fact
of
louise
having
left
the
town
and
of
his
never
being
likely
to
see
her
again
gradually
however
he
began
to
be
astonished
at
himself
and
in
the
background
of
his
mind
there
arose
a
somewhat
morbid
curiosity
even
a
slight
alarm
at
his
own
indifference
he
found
it
hard
to
understand
himself
could
his
feelings
those
feelings
which
a
week
or
two
ago
he
had
believed
unalterable
have
changed
in
so
short
a
time
was
his
nature
one
of
so
little
stability
he
began
to
consider
himself
with
something
approaching
dismay
and
though
all
this
time
he
had
been
going
about
on
a
kind
of
mental
tiptoe
for
fear
of
rousing
something
that
might
be
dormant
in
him
he
now
could
not
help
probing
himself
in
order
to
see
if
the
change
he
observed
were
genuine
or
not
and
this
with
a
steadily
increasing
frequency
instead
of
continuing
thankful
for
the
respite
he
ultimately
grew
uneasy
under
it
am
i
a
person
of
this
weak
consistency
to
be
tossed
about
by
every
wind
that
blows
is
there
something
beneath
it
all
that
i
can
not
fathom
he
had
not
seen
louise
since
the
night
he
had
left
her
asleep
beside
the
sofa
and
he
was
resolved
not
to
see
her
not
at
least
until
she
wished
to
see
him
it
was
much
better
for
him
that
the
uncertainties
of
the
bygone
months
did
not
begin
anew
then
too
she
had
called
him
to
her
when
she
was
in
trouble
and
not
for
anything
in
the
world
would
he
presume
on
her
appeal
besides
his
presence
would
recall
to
her
the
unpleasant
details
connected
with
ephie
visit
which
he
hoped
she
had
by
this
time
begun
to
forget
thus
he
argued
with
himself
giving
several
reasons
where
one
would
have
served
and
the
upshot
of
it
was
that
his
own
state
of
mind
occupied
him
considerably
his
friends
noticed
the
improvement
in
him
the
careworn
expression
that
had
settled
down
on
him
of
late
gave
way
to
his
old
air
of
animation
and
on
all
the
small
topics
of
the
day
he
brought
a
sympathetic
interest
to
bear
such
as
people
had
ceased
to
expect
from
him
madeleine
in
particular
was
satisfied
with
her
boy
as
she
took
to
calling
him
she
noted
and
checked
off
in
wise
silence
each
inch
of
his
progress
along
the
road
of
healthy
endeavour
and
the
relations
between
them
became
almost
as
hearty
as
at
the
commencement
of
their
friendship
privately
she
believed
that
the
events
of
the
past
month
had
taught
him
a
lesson
which
he
would
not
soon
forget
it
was
sufficient
however
if
they
had
inspired
him
with
a
distrust
of
louise
which
would
keep
him
from
her
for
the
present
for
madeleine
had
grounds
for
believing
that
before
many
weeks
had
passed
louise
would
have
left
leipzig
so
she
kept
maurice
as
close
to
her
as
work
permitted
and
as
the
winter
flood
of
concerts
set
in
in
full
force
he
accompanied
her
almost
nightly
to
the
old
gewandhaus
or
the
alberthalle
for
madeleine
was
an
indefatigable
and
never
missed
a
performer
of
note
rarely
even
a
first
appearance
at
the
hotel
de
prusse
or
a
bluthner
matinee
on
the
night
she
herself
played
in
an
aibendunterhaltung
with
the
easily
gained
success
that
attended
all
she
did
maurice
went
with
her
to
the
and
was
the
first
afterwards
to
tell
her
how
her
performance
had
gone
that
same
evening
she
took
him
with
her
to
the
house
of
friends
of
hers
the
hensels
there
he
met
some
of
the
best
musical
society
of
the
place
made
a
pleasant
impression
and
was
invited
to
return
meanwhile
winter
had
set
in
with
extreme
severity
piercing
north
winds
drove
down
the
narrow
streets
and
raged
round
the
corners
of
the
gewandhaus
square
on
emerging
from
the
probe
on
a
wednesday
morning
one
breath
was
cut
clean
off
and
the
tears
raced
down
one
cheeks
when
the
wind
dropped
there
were
hard
black
frosts
a
deadly
stagnant
kind
of
cold
which
seemed
to
penetrate
every
pore
of
the
skin
and
every
cranny
of
the
house
then
came
the
snow
which
fell
for
three
days
and
nights
on
end
and
for
several
nights
after
so
that
the
town
was
lost
under
a
white
pall
were
with
difficulty
kept
free
and
the
swept
streets
were
banked
with
walls
of
snow
four
and
five
feet
high
the
redoubled
their
keenness
the
snow
underfoot
crackled
like
electric
sparks
the
sleighs
crunched
the
roads
but
except
for
this
and
for
the
tinkling
of
the
the
streets
were
as
noiseless
as
though
laid
with
straw
and
especially
while
fresh
snow
still
formed
a
soft
coating
on
the
crisp
layer
below
all
dripping
water
hung
as
icicles
water
froze
in
ewers
and
pitchers
milk
froze
in
cans
and
jugs
and
this
though
the
great
stoves
in
the
were
heated
to
men
on
whose
beards
and
moustaches
the
breath
had
turned
to
cried
to
one
another
at
that
such
a
winter
had
not
been
known
for
thirty
years
and
as
they
spoke
they
stamped
their
feet
and
clapped
their
hands
to
keep
the
chilly
blood
agoing
women
muffled
and
veiled
themselves
like
orientals
hardly
showing
the
tips
of
their
noses
and
all
manner
of
strange
antiquated
saw
the
day
at
night
if
one
opened
a
window
and
peered
out
at
the
houses
crouching
beneath
their
thick
white
load
and
at
the
deserted
streets
over
which
the
threw
a
pale
uncertain
light
at
night
familiar
things
took
on
an
unfamiliar
aspect
and
the
streets
might
have
been
the
untrodden
ways
that
led
to
a
new
world
early
in
november
all
ponds
and
pools
were
bearing
and
forthwith
many
hundreds
of
people
forgot
the
severity
of
the
weather
and
thronged
out
with
their
skates
maurice
was
among
the
first
he
was
a
passionate
skater
and
it
was
the
one
form
of
sport
in
which
he
excelled
as
four
came
round
he
could
contain
himself
no
longer
he
would
rather
have
gone
without
his
dinner
than
have
missed
on
the
johannateich
the
two
hours
that
elapsed
before
the
sweepers
crying
feierabend
drove
the
skaters
before
them
with
their
brooms
in
a
tightly
buttoned
square
jacket
the
collar
of
which
was
turned
up
as
far
as
it
would
go
with
the
flaps
of
his
astrachan
cap
drawn
over
his
cars
his
hands
in
coarse
woollen
gloves
maurice
defied
the
cold
flying
round
the
two
ponds
that
formed
the
johannateich
or
practising
intricate
figures
with
a
canadian
acquaintance
in
a
corner
madeleine
watched
him
approvingly
from
one
of
the
wooden
bridges
that
spanned
the
neck
connecting
the
ponds
she
rejoiced
at
his
glowing
face
and
vigorous
boyish
pleasure
also
at
the
skill
that
marked
him
out
as
one
of
the
best
skaters
present
for
some
time
maurice
tried
in
vain
to
persuade
her
to
join
him
madeleine
usually
so
confident
was
here
diffident
and
timid
she
had
never
in
her
life
attempted
to
skate
and
was
sure
she
would
fall
and
what
should
she
do
if
she
broke
a
thumb
or
strained
a
finger
with
her
prufung
just
before
the
door
she
would
never
have
the
courage
to
confess
to
schwarz
how
it
had
happened
for
he
was
against
sport
in
any
form
but
maurice
laughed
at
her
fears
there
is
not
the
least
chance
of
your
falling
he
cried
up
to
her
do
come
down
madeleine
before
you
gone
round
twice
you
be
able
to
throw
off
all
those
mufflings
finally
she
let
herself
be
persuaded
and
according
to
his
promise
maurice
remained
at
her
side
from
the
moment
of
her
first
hesitating
steps
each
of
which
was
accompanied
by
a
faint
scream
to
the
time
when
with
the
aid
of
only
one
of
his
hands
she
made
uncertain
efforts
at
striking
out
she
did
not
learn
quickly
but
she
was
soon
as
enthusiastic
a
skater
as
maurice
himself
and
he
fell
into
the
habit
of
calling
for
her
every
afternoon
on
his
way
to
the
ponds
dove
was
also
of
assistance
in
the
beginning
and
as
usual
was
well
up
in
the
theory
of
the
thing
though
he
did
not
shine
in
practice
oh
bother
never
mind
how
you
go
at
first
that
come
afterwards
said
maurice
impatiently
but
dove
thought
the
rules
should
be
observed
from
the
beginning
and
gave
madeleine
minute
instructions
how
to
place
her
feet
towards
five
the
ice
grew
more
crowded
and
especially
was
this
the
case
on
wednesdays
and
saturdays
when
the
schools
had
on
one
of
these
latter
days
maurice
did
not
find
madeleine
at
home
and
he
had
been
on
the
ponds
for
nearly
an
hour
before
he
espied
her
on
a
bench
beside
the
garderobe
having
her
skates
put
on
by
a
attendant
he
waved
his
cap
to
her
and
skated
over
why
are
you
so
late
oh
thank
goodness
there
you
are
i
should
never
have
dared
to
stand
up
alone
in
this
crowd
are
these
children
awful
get
away
you
little
brutes
if
you
touch
me
i
here
give
me
change
she
said
to
the
holding
out
a
piece
maurice
saw
that
she
was
unusually
excited
and
as
soon
as
he
had
drawn
her
out
of
reach
of
the
children
asked
her
the
reason
i
something
interesting
to
tell
you
maurice
but
here
dove
coming
up
behind
took
possession
of
her
left
hand
with
no
other
greeting
than
the
military
salute
which
on
the
ice
he
adopted
for
all
his
friends
male
and
female
alike
and
madeleine
hastily
swallowed
the
rest
of
her
sentence
they
skated
round
the
larger
of
the
ponds
several
times
without
stopping
the
cold
evening
air
stung
their
faces
the
sun
had
gone
down
in
a
lurid
haze
madeleine
skirts
swayed
behind
her
and
lent
her
a
fictitious
grace
but
presently
she
cried
a
halt
and
while
she
rested
in
a
quiet
corner
they
watched
maurice
doing
a
complicated
figure
which
he
and
his
canadian
friend
had
invented
the
day
before
dove
was
explaining
how
it
was
done
it
is
really
not
so
hard
as
it
looks
when
with
a
cry
of
achtung
some
one
whizzed
in
among
them
scattered
the
group
and
revolving
on
himself
ended
with
a
jump
in
the
air
it
was
james
he
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
blew
his
nose
in
the
most
unconcerned
manner
possible
i
do
think
such
acrobatic
tricks
should
be
allowed
said
madeleine
disapprovingly
she
had
been
forced
to
grab
dove
arm
to
keep
her
balance
say
do
you
boys
know
the
river
has
six
inches
and
will
be
open
if
it
is
asked
james
stooping
to
tighten
a
strap
is
that
so
oh
gee
that
fine
cried
miss
martin
who
had
skated
leisurely
up
in
his
rear
say
you
people
why
do
we
fix
up
a
party
an
go
up
it
nights
a
lady
in
my
done
that
with
some
folks
she
was
acquainted
with
last
year
seems
to
me
we
ought
to
be
behind
miss
martin
was
a
skilled
and
graceful
skater
and
looked
her
best
in
a
dark
fur
hat
and
jacket
which
set
off
her
abundance
of
pale
flaxen
hair
others
had
followed
her
and
it
was
resolved
to
form
a
party
for
the
following
evening
provided
dove
had
previously
ascertained
if
the
river
actually
was
free
in
order
that
they
ran
no
risk
of
being
ignominiously
turned
off
the
ice
may
be
a
bit
rough
but
it
a
fine
run
to
connewitz
an
by
moonlight
too
but
say
is
there
a
moon
why
i
presume
there
ought
to
be
said
miss
martin
the
moon
shine
that
night
we
play
our
play
quoted
dove
examining
a
tiny
oh
gee
that
fine
repeated
miss
martin
on
hearing
his
answer
say
we
must
dance
a
francaise
mr
guest
you
an
i
be
partners
i
surmise
and
ceasing
to
waltz
and
pirouette
with
james
she
took
a
long
sweep
then
stood
steady
and
let
her
skates
bear
her
out
to
the
middle
of
the
pond
her
skirts
clung
close
in
front
and
swept
out
behind
her
lithe
figure
until
it
was
lost
in
the
crowd
do
you
wish
you
could
skate
like
that
asked
the
little
student
called
dickensey
who
was
standing
beside
madeleine
madeleine
who
held
him
in
contempt
because
his
trousers
were
baggy
at
the
knees
and
because
he
had
once
appeared
at
a
ball
in
white
cotton
gloves
answered
with
asperity
that
there
were
other
things
in
life
besides
skating
she
had
no
further
chance
of
speaking
to
maurice
in
private
so
postponed
telling
her
news
till
the
following
evening
shortly
after
eight
the
next
night
a
noisy
party
whistled
and
hallooed
in
the
street
below
maurice
window
he
was
the
last
to
join
and
then
some
ten
or
eleven
of
them
picked
their
steps
along
the
ruts
of
the
schleussiger
weg
a
road
that
followed
the
river
to
the
outskirts
of
the
town
just
above
the
germaniabad
a
rough
scat
had
been
erected
on
the
ice
for
the
convenience
of
skaters
they
were
the
first
to
make
use
of
it
the
snow
before
it
was
untrodden
and
the
pleisse
wound
white
and
solitary
between
its
banks
of
snow
they
set
off
in
a
fashion
each
striking
out
for
himself
when
however
they
had
passed
the
narrower
windings
gone
under
the
iron
bridge
which
was
low
enough
to
catch
the
unwary
by
the
forehead
and
when
the
full
breadth
of
the
river
was
before
them
they
took
hands
and
forming
a
long
line
skated
in
time
to
the
songs
some
one
struck
up
and
in
which
all
joined
the
rose
of
sharon
jingle
bells
there
is
a
tavern
in
our
town
as
they
advanced
to
the
corners
where
the
big
trees
trailed
their
naked
branches
on
the
ice
just
as
in
summer
they
sank
their
leaves
in
the
water
miss
jensen
who
despite
her
proportions
was
a
surprisingly
good
skater
sent
her
big
voice
over
the
stillness
in
an
aria
from
the
prophet
and
after
this
miss
martin
no
to
be
done
struck
up
the
popular
allerseelen
this
was
the
song
of
the
hour
they
all
knew
it
and
up
and
down
and
across
the
ice
rang
out
their
voices
in
unison
wie
einst
im
mai
wie
einst
im
mai
inside
wagner
waldcafe
at
connewitz
they
sat
closely
packed
round
one
of
the
wooden
tables
and
drank
beer
and
coffee
and
ate
berliner
pfannkuchen
the
great
iron
stove
was
almost
the
ladies
threw
off
their
wrappings
cold
faces
glowed
and
burnt
and
frozen
hands
tingled
one
and
all
were
in
high
spirits
and
the
jollity
reached
a
climax
when
having
exchanged
hats
james
and
miss
jensen
cleared
a
space
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
danced
a
the
lady
with
her
skirts
tucked
up
above
her
ankles
in
the
adjoining
room
some
one
began
to
play
a
concertina
and
then
two
or
three
couples
stood
up
and
danced
with
much
laughter
and
many
outcries
at
the
narrowness
of
the
space
even
dove
joined
in
his
partner
being
a
very
pretty
american
whom
miss
martin
had
brought
with
her
and
whose
side
dove
had
not
left
for
a
moment
only
madeleine
and
dickensey
sat
aloof
and
for
once
were
agreed
americans
were
really
very
bad
form
there
was
no
livelier
pair
than
maurice
and
miss
martin
the
latter
voice
could
be
heard
above
all
others
as
she
taught
maurice
new
steps
in
a
corner
of
the
room
her
flaxen
hair
had
partly
come
loose
and
she
did
not
stop
to
put
it
up
they
were
the
first
to
run
through
the
dark
garden
past
the
benches
and
arbours
which
in
summer
were
buried
in
greenery
and
from
the
low
wooden
landing
place
they
jumped
hand
in
hand
on
to
the
ice
and
had
shot
a
long
way
down
the
river
before
any
of
the
rest
could
follow
them
but
this
did
not
please
madeleine
as
it
was
she
was
vexed
at
not
having
had
the
opportunity
of
a
quiet
word
with
maurice
and
when
she
had
laboriously
skated
up
with
dickensey
to
the
spot
where
in
a
bright
splash
of
moonlight
maurice
and
miss
martin
were
cutting
ingenious
capers
she
cried
to
the
former
in
a
peremptory
tone
there
something
wrong
with
my
skate
maurice
will
you
look
at
it
please
and
as
sharply
declined
dickensey
proffered
aid
maurice
came
to
her
side
at
once
and
in
this
way
she
detained
him
but
dickensey
hovered
not
far
off
and
miss
martin
was
still
in
sight
madeleine
caught
her
skate
in
a
crack
fell
on
her
knee
and
said
she
had
now
loosened
the
strap
altogether
she
sat
down
on
a
heap
of
snow
and
dickensey
shade
vanished
round
a
corner
well
you
seem
to
be
enjoying
yourself
she
said
as
maurice
drew
off
his
gloves
and
knelt
down
why
yes
are
you
he
replied
so
frankly
that
she
did
not
continue
the
subject
i
been
trying
all
the
evening
to
get
a
word
with
you
i
told
you
yesterday
you
remember
that
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
sit
down
here
for
a
moment
so
that
we
can
talk
in
peace
and
she
spread
part
of
her
skirt
over
the
maurice
complied
and
she
could
not
discover
any
trace
of
reluctance
in
his
manner
i
want
your
advice
she
continued
i
was
taken
quite
by
surprise
myself
schwarz
sent
for
me
you
know
after
counterpoint
it
was
about
my
prufung
at
easter
if
i
play
then
it
a
case
of
the
c
minor
beethoven
well
now
he
says
it
a
thousand
pities
for
me
to
break
off
just
at
the
stage
i
at
and
he
wants
me
to
stay
for
another
year
if
i
do
he
give
me
the
g
major
that
a
temptation
is
it
on
the
other
hand
i
shall
have
been
here
my
full
time
three
years
at
easter
that
a
year
longer
than
i
originally
intended
and
i
feel
getting
too
old
to
be
a
pupil
but
this
talk
with
schwarz
has
upset
my
plans
i
naturally
flattered
at
his
interesting
himself
in
me
he
would
do
it
for
every
one
and
i
do
feel
i
could
gain
an
immense
deal
in
another
now
what
do
you
think
why
stay
of
course
madeleine
if
you
can
afford
it
that
is
i
ca
imagine
anyone
wanting
to
leave
oh
my
capital
will
last
so
long
and
it
a
good
enough
investment
but
was
a
place
being
kept
open
for
you
in
a
school
yes
but
i
do
think
a
year
more
or
less
will
make
much
difference
to
them
i
must
sound
them
of
course
though
said
madeleine
and
did
not
mention
that
she
had
written
and
posted
the
letter
the
night
before
then
you
advise
me
to
stay
why
of
course
he
repeated
and
was
mildly
astonished
at
her
if
everything
is
as
smooth
as
you
say
you
would
miss
me
if
i
left
why
of
course
i
should
he
said
again
and
wondered
what
in
the
world
she
was
driving
at
well
all
the
better
replied
madeleine
for
when
one
has
really
got
to
like
a
person
one
would
rather
it
made
a
difference
than
not
she
was
silent
after
this
and
sat
looking
down
the
stretch
of
ice
they
had
travelled
the
moon
was
behind
a
cloud
and
the
woods
on
either
side
were
masses
of
dense
black
shadow
not
a
soul
was
in
sight
the
river
was
like
a
deserted
highway
madeleine
stared
down
it
and
did
not
feel
exactly
satisfied
with
the
result
of
her
investigation
she
had
not
expected
anything
extraordinary
heaven
forbid
but
she
had
been
uncomfortably
conscious
of
maurice
surprise
to
her
last
remark
he
had
made
no
answer
he
was
occupied
with
the
screw
of
one
of
his
skates
she
drew
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
if
she
remained
in
leipzig
for
another
twelvemonth
they
would
finish
at
the
same
time
and
thereupon
she
sketched
out
a
plan
of
them
going
somewhere
together
and
starting
a
of
their
own
maurice
who
thought
she
was
jesting
laughingly
assented
but
madeleine
was
in
earnest
other
people
have
done
it
why
should
we
we
could
take
a
with
us
and
go
to
america
or
australia
or
canada
there
are
hundreds
of
places
and
there
a
great
deal
of
money
in
it
i
sure
a
little
capital
would
be
needed
to
begin
with
but
not
much
and
i
could
supply
that
always
said
you
dreaded
going
back
to
the
english
provinces
to
decay
here
your
chance
she
saw
the
whole
scheme
cut
and
dried
before
her
as
they
skated
after
the
rest
she
continued
to
enlarge
upon
it
in
a
detailed
way
that
astonished
maurice
he
confessed
that
with
a
head
like
hers
to
conduct
it
such
a
plan
stood
a
fair
chance
of
success
and
thus
encouraged
madeleine
undertook
to
make
a
kind
of
beginning
at
once
by
sounding
some
of
the
numerous
friends
she
had
scattered
through
america
her
idea
was
that
they
should
go
over
together
and
travel
to
various
places
giving
concerts
and
acquainting
themselves
as
they
did
so
with
the
musical
conditions
of
the
towns
they
visited
and
the
shall
be
an
american
that
will
draw
according
to
the
pace
at
which
they
were
skating
the
others
should
have
remained
well
out
of
reach
but
on
turning
a
corner
they
came
upon
the
whole
party
dancing
a
francaise
which
two
members
whistled
on
a
patch
of
ice
that
was
smoother
than
the
rest
here
guest
come
along
we
want
you
was
the
cry
as
soon
as
maurice
appeared
and
to
madeleine
deep
displeasure
she
was
thrown
on
dove
whose
skill
had
not
sufficed
when
the
dancing
was
over
maurice
once
more
found
himself
with
miss
martin
whom
for
some
distance
he
pushed
before
him
she
standing
steady
on
her
skates
and
talking
to
him
over
her
shoulder
that
was
a
bit
pretty
of
you
mr
guest
she
asserted
with
her
long
slow
twanged
speech
it
was
fixed
up
yesterday
i
recollect
that
you
were
to
dance
the
francaise
with
me
yes
indeed
an
then
i
had
to
take
up
with
dove
now
dove
is
just
a
lovely
gentleman
but
he
do
skate
elegantly
an
he
nearly
tumbled
me
twice
yes
indeed
but
i
presume
when
miss
wade
says
come
then
you
most
obliged
to
go
how
is
it
one
do
ever
see
you
now
she
queried
a
moment
later
it
is
anyhow
so
pleasurable
at
dinner
as
it
used
to
be
but
i
hear
you
working
most
hard
it
to
bad
it
what
one
comes
to
here
i
guess
it
is
but
i
do
like
to
see
my
friends
once
in
a
while
say
now
mr
guest
wo
you
drink
coffee
with
me
one
afternoon
i
make
you
some
real
american
coffee
if
you
do
sir
what
they
call
coffee
here
do
count
she
turned
offered
him
her
hand
and
they
began
to
skate
in
long
outward
curving
lines
i
think
one
has
just
a
fine
time
here
do
you
she
continued
momma
she
came
right
with
me
an
stopped
a
bit
till
i
was
fixed
up
in
a
but
she
did
find
it
agreeable
no
sir
she
missed
america
an
presumed
i
would
too
when
she
was
leaving
she
said
to
me
martin
if
you
find
you
ca
endure
it
among
these
dutch
just
you
cable
and
poppa
he
come
along
an
fetch
you
right
home
but
i
sure
i
have
desired
to
quit
no
not
once
i
think
it
just
fine
but
then
i
gotten
me
so
many
friends
i
do
ever
need
to
feel
lonesome
why
my
friend
susie
fay
she
says
i
guess

with
most
every
one
in
the
place
an
i
reckon
she
not
far
out
anyways
there
ai
more
than
two
americans
in
the
city
i
do
know
an

maurice
expressed
pleasure
at
the
prospect
and
miss
martin
continued
to
rattle
on
with
easy
frankness
of
herself
her
family
and
her
friends
he
listened
vaguely
with
half
an
ear
since
it
was
only
required
of
him
to
throw
in
an
occasional
word
of
assent
but
suddenly
his
attention
was
arrested
and
brought
headlong
back
to
what
she
was
saying
in
the
string
of
names
that
fell
from
her
tongue
he
believed
he
had
caught
one
he
knew
miss
dufrayer
he
queried
that
it
replied
his
companion
louise
dufrayer
well
sir
as
i
was
going
on
to
remark
when
first
i
was
acquainted
with
her
she
was
just
as
sweet
as
she
could
be
yes
indeed
why
she
was
just
dandy
but
she
has
behaved
a
bit
pretty
i
presume

tell
of
what
took
place
here

fall
then

miss
dufrayer
yes
indeed
but
i
do

i
guess

what
i
heard
she
feels
pretty
mean
about
it
now

pardon
how
i
know
why
indeed
the
other
day
schwarz
come
in

us
how
she
moping
what
she
can
moping
herself
to
death
if
i
recollect
those
were
his
very
words
yes
indeed
she

i
presume
i
think
she
should
go
right
away
from
this
city
it
ai
possible
to
be
acquainted
with
her
any
more
for
all
she
so
lonesome
an
one

sort
of
bad
about

yes
indeed
but
momma
the
last
thing
she
said
to
me
was
martin
just
keep
your
eyes
open
an
do
get
acquainted
with
people
you
might
feel
bad
about
afterwards
an
i
presume
momma
was
right
i
do
oh
say
do
look
at
her
is
she
a
peach
this
as
her
pretty
friend
with
dove
in
tow
came
gliding
up
to
them
say
susie
fay
are
you
acquainted
with
mr
guest
mr
guest
pleased
to
know
you
said
susie
cordially
and
miss
martin
was
enough
to
skate
off
with
dove
leaving
maurice
to
her
friend
but
afterwards
at
the
bench
as
he
was
undoing
madeleine
skates
he
overheard
pretty
susie
remark
without
much
care
to
moderate
her
voice
say
martin
that
the
quietest
sort
of
young
man
i
ever
shown
round
a
district
why
seems
to
me
he
could
say
guess
you
should
have
left
us
and
miss
martin
guessed
so
too
vii
when
he
had
seen
madeleine
home
maurice
returned
to
his
room
and
not
feeling
inclined
to
sleep
sat
down
to
read
but
his
thoughts
strayed
he
forgot
to
turn
the
page
and
sat
staring
over
the
book
at
the
pattern
of
the
tablecloth
incidents
of
the
evening
flashed
before
him
miss
jensen
in
james
hat
with
her
skirts
pinned
up
madeleine
earnest
and
decisive
on
the
bank
of
snow
the
maze
and
laughter
of
the
francaise
miss
martin
slim
straight
figure
as
he
pushed
her
before
him
he
did
not
try
to
control
these
details
nor
was
he
conscious
of
a
mental
effort
they
stood
out
for
an
instant
as
vivid
sensations
then
glided
by
to
make
room
for
others
but
as
he
let
them
pass
he
became
aware
that
below
them
in
depths
of
his
mind
he
had
believed
undisturbed
there
was
present
a
feeling
of
strange
unhappiness
which
he
did
not
know
the
cause
of
these
sharp
pictures
resembled
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
his
mind
to
deceive
him
as
to
what
was
really
going
on
in
him
but
he
did
not
want
to
know
and
he
allowed
his
thoughts
to
take
wider
flights
recalling
the
scheme
madeleine
had
proposed
he
considered
it
with
a
clearness
of
view
which
at
the
time
had
been
impossible
from
this
he
turned
to
america
itself
and
reflected
on
the
opportunities
the
country
offered
he
saw
the
two
of
them
sweeping
through
vast
tracts
of
uncultivated
land
in
a
train
that
outdid
all
real
trains
in
swiftness
saw
unknown
tropical
places
where
the
yellow
fruit
hung
low
and
heavy
and
people
walked
shadeless
sandy
roads
in
white
hats
under
white
umbrellas
he
saw
madeleine
and
himself
on
the
deck
of
an
ocean
steamer
anchoring
in
a
harbour
where
the
sea
was
the
colour
of
turquoise
touched
to
sapphire
where
the
mountains
came
down
to
the
shore
moping
herself
to
death
the
phrase
crystallised
in
his
brain
with
such
suddenness
that
he
said
it
aloud
now
he
knew
what
it
was
that
was
troubling
him
he
had
not
consciously
recalled
the
words
nor
had
they
even
made
a
very
incisive
impression
on
him
at
the
time
but
they
had
evidently
lain
dormant
now
to
return
and
to
strike
him
as
if
no
others
had
been
said
he
explained
to
himself
what
they
meant
it
was
this
outside
in
the
crisp
stinging
air
people
lived
and
moved
busy
with
many
matters
or
sported
as
he
and
his
companions
had
done
that
evening
inside
she
sat
alone
mournful
forsaken
he
saw
her
in
the
dark
sofacorner
with
her
head
on
her
hands
day
passed
and
night
passed
but
she
was
always
in
the
same
place
and
her
head
was
bowed
so
low
that
her
white
fingers
were
lost
in
the
waves
of
her
hair
he
saw
her
thus
with
the
distinctness
of
a
vision
and
except
in
this
way
could
not
see
her
at
all
he
felt
it
little
short
of
shameful
that
he
should
have
carelessly
amused
himself
and
as
always
where
she
was
concerned
a
deep
unreasoning
sense
of
his
own
unworthiness
filled
him
he
demanded
of
himself
with
a
new
energy
what
he
could
do
to
help
her
fantastic
plans
rose
as
usual
in
his
mind
and
as
usual
were
dismissed
for
the
one
thing
he
was
determined
not
to
do
was
to
thrust
himself
on
her
uncalled
her
solitude
was
of
her
own
choosing
and
no
one
had
the
right
to
break
in
upon
it
it
was
perhaps
her
way
of
doing
penance
and
at
this
thought
he
felt
a
thrill
of
satisfaction
at
night
he
consoled
himself
that
things
would
seem
different
in
the
morning
but
when
he
wakened
from
a
restless
sleep
crowded
with
dreams
one
more
grotesque
than
another
he
was
still
prone
to
be
gloomy
he
could
think
more
clearly
by
daylight
that
was
all
his
pitying
sympathy
for
her
had
only
increased
it
interfered
with
everything
he
did
just
as
it
had
formerly
done
just
in
the
old
way
and
he
had
been
on
the
brink
of
believing
himself
grown
indifferent
and
stronger
in
common
sense
fool
that
he
was
only
a
word
was
needed
to
bring
his
down
the
placidity
of
the
past
weeks
had
been
a
mere
coating
of
thin
ice
which
had
given
way
beneath
the
first
test
a
distrust
of
himself
took
him
a
distrust
so
deep
that
it
amounted
to
aversion
for
in
his
present
state
of
mind
he
discerned
only
a
despicable
weakness
but
though
he
was
thus
bewildered
at
his
own
inconsistency
he
was
still
assured
that
he
would
not
approach
louise
not
that
is
unless
she
sent
for
him
so
much
control
he
still
had
over
his
actions
and
he
went
so
far
as
to
make
his
staying
away
a
touchstone
of
his
stability
this
too
although
reason
told
him
the
end
of
it
all
would
be
that
louise
would
actually
leave
leipzig
without
sending
for
him
or
even
remembering
his
existence
he
worked
steadily
enough
a
skilled
observer
might
have
remarked
a
slight
contraction
of
the
corners
of
his
mouth
none
of
his
friends
however
noticed
anything
with
the
exception
of
madeleine
and
all
she
said
was
you
look
so
cross
sometimes
is
anything
the
matter
late
one
afternoon
they
were
on
the
ice
as
usual
while
madeleine
talked
to
dickensey
maurice
practised
beside
them
in
making
a
particularly
complicated
gyration
he
all
but
overbalanced
himself
and
his
cap
fell
on
the
ice
as
he
was
brushing
the
snow
off
it
he
chanced
to
raise
his
eyes
a
number
of
people
were
standing
on
the
wooden
bridge
watching
the
skaters
to
the
front
some
children
climbed
and
pushed
on
the
wooden
railing
his
eye
was
ranging
carelessly
over
them
when
he
started
so
violently
that
he
again
let
his
cap
drop
he
picked
it
up
threw
another
hasty
look
at
the
bridge
then
turned
and
skated
some
distance
away
where
he
could
see
without
being
seen
yes
he
had
not
been
mistaken
it
was
louise
he
recognised
her
although
a
fur
hat
almost
covered
her
hair
she
was
gazing
down
with
an
intentness
he
knew
in
her
one
hand
rested
on
the
parapet
and
then
as
he
looked
his
blood
seemed
to
congeal
she
was
not
alone
he
saw
her
turn
and
speak
to
some
one
behind
her
for
a
moment
things
swam
before
him
then
a
blind
curiosity
drove
him
forward
to
find
out
whom
she
spoke
to
people
moved
on
the
bridge
obstructing
his
view
then
several
went
away
and
there
was
no
further
hindrance
to
his
seeing
her
companion
was
the
shabby
little
englishman
of
doubtful
reputation
with
whom
he
had
met
her
once
or
twice
that
summer
he
felt
himself
grow
cold
but
now
that
he
had
certainty
his
chief
idea
was
to
prevent
the
others
from
knowing
too
he
grew
sick
at
the
thought
of
madeleine
sharp
comments
and
dickensey
cynicism
rejoining
them
he
insisted
so
imperiously
that
madeleine
showed
surprise
on
their
skating
with
him
on
the
further
pond
and
he
kept
them
going
round
and
round
without
a
pause
when
the
bridge
was
empty
and
he
had
made
sure
that
louise
was
not
standing
anywhere
about
the
edge
of
the
ice
he
left
his
companions
and
without
explanation
crossed
to
the
benches
and
took
off
his
skates
he
did
not
however
go
home
he
went
into
the
scheibenholz
and
from
there
along
outlying
roads
till
he
reached
the
river
and
then
screwing
on
his
skates
again
he
struck
out
with
his
face
to
the
wind
dusk
was
falling
at
first
he
met
some
skaters
making
for
home
but
these
were
few
and
he
soon
left
them
behind
when
the
state
of
the
ice
did
not
allow
of
his
skating
further
he
plunged
into
the
woods
again
beyond
connewitz
tumbling
in
his
haste
tripping
over
roots
sinking
kneedeep
in
the
soft
snow
his
endeavour
was
to
exhaust
himself
if
he
sat
at
home
now
before
this
fever
was
out
of
him
he
might
be
tempted
to
knock
his
head
against
the
wall
of
his
room
movement
space
air
plenty
of
air
that
was
what
he
needed
hitherto
he
had
been
surprised
at
his
own
conduct
now
he
was
aghast
the
hot
rush
of
jealousy
that
had
swept
through
him
at
the
sight
of
the
couple
on
the
bridge
was
a
revelation
even
to
himself
his
previous
feelings
had
been
those
of
a
child
compared
with
this
a
mere
weak
revolt
against
the
inevitable
but
what
had
now
happened
was
not
inevitable
that
was
the
sting
of
it
it
was
a
violent
and
his
distress
was
so
keen
that
for
the
first
time
she
too
had
to
bear
her
share
of
blame
he
said
jeeringly
to
himself
that
quixotic
as
ever
he
had
held
aloof
from
her
leaving
her
in
solitude
to
an
atonement
of
his
own
imagining
and
meanwhile
some
one
who
was
not
troubled
by
foolish
ideals
stepped
in
and
took
his
place
for
it
was
his
place
he
could
not
rid
himself
of
that
belief
if
anyone
had
a
right
to
be
at
her
side
it
was
he
unless
indeed
all
that
he
had
undergone
on
her
behalf
during
the
past
months
counted
for
nothing
of
course
this
eggis
was
an
unscrupulous
fellow
but
it
was
just
such
men
as
this
he
might
note
that
for
future
use
who
won
where
others
lost
at
the
same
time
he
shrank
from
the
idea
of
imitating
him
and
even
had
he
been
bold
enough
not
a
single
errand
could
he
devise
to
serve
him
as
an
excuse
he
could
not
go
to
her
and
say
i
come
because
i
have
seen
you
with
some
one
else
and
yet
that
would
be
the
truth
and
it
would
lurk
beneath
all
he
said
the
days
of
anxiety
that
followed
were
hard
to
bear
he
dreaded
every
for
fear
louise
and
the
other
should
turn
it
dreaded
raising
his
eyes
to
the
bridges
over
the
ice
and
was
so
irritable
in
temper
that
madeleine
suggested
he
should
go
to
dresden
in
the
christmas
holidays
for
change
of
air
for
over
all
this
christmas
had
come
down
the
season
of
and
glittering
christmas
trees
of
bowle
stollen
and
honigkuchen
for
a
fortnight
beforehand
the
open
squares
and
places
were
set
out
with
of
all
sizes
their
pungent
fragrance
met
one
at
every
turn
the
shops
were
ablaze
till
late
evening
crowded
with
eagerly
seeking
purchasers
the
streets
were
impassible
for
the
masses
of
country
people
that
thronged
them
every
one
carried
brown
paper
parcels
and
was
in
a
hurry
as
the
time
drew
near
subordinates
and
officials
grew
noticeably
polite
the
very
houseporter
touched
his
cap
at
your
approach
bakers
shops
were
piled
high
with
weihnachtsstollen
which
were
a
special
mark
of
the
festival
cakes
shaped
like
torpedoes
whose
sugared
almonded
coats
brisked
brown
and
tempting
but
the
spicy
scent
of
the
firs
was
the
motive
that
recurred
most
persistently
it
clung
even
to
the
stairways
of
the
houses
maurice
had
assisted
madeleine
with
her
circumstantial
shopping
and
at
dusk
on
christmas
eve
he
helped
her
to
carry
her
parcels
to
the
house
of
some
german
friends
he
himself
was
invited
to
miss
jensen
where
a
party
of
english
and
americans
would
celebrate
the
evening
in
their
own
fashion
but
not
till
eight
when
he
had
picked
out
at
a
confectioner
a
torte
for
the
fursts
he
did
not
know
how
to
kill
time
he
was
in
an
unsettled
mood
and
the
atmosphere
of
excitement
which
had
penetrated
the
familiar
details
of
life
jarred
on
him
it
seemed
absurdly
childish
the
way
in
which
even
the
part
of
the
population
surrendered
itself
to
the
sentimental
pleasures
of
the
season
but
foreigners
were
only
big
children
or
at
least
they
could
lay
aside
age
and
dignity
at
will
he
felt
misanthropic
and
went
for
a
long
walk
and
when
he
had
passed
the
last
where
poor
buyers
were
bargaining
for
the
poor
trees
that
were
left
he
met
only
isolated
stragglers
in
some
houses
the
trees
were
already
lighted
on
his
return
he
went
to
a
in
the
konigsplatz
and
chose
an
azalea
to
take
to
miss
jensen
while
he
was
waiting
for
the
pot
to
be
swathed
in
crimped
paper
his
eye
was
caught
by
a
large
bunch
of
red
and
yellow
roses
which
stood
in
a
vase
at
the
back
of
the
counter
he
regarded
them
for
a
moment
without
conscious
thought
then
suddenly
colouring
he
stretched
out
his
hand
i
take
those
roses
too
what
do
they
cost
the
girl
who
served
him
a
very
pretty
girl
with
plaits
of
hair
wound
round
her
head
named
a
sum
that
seemed
exorbitant
to
his
inexperience
and
told
a
wordy
story
of
how
they
had
been
ordered
and
then
countermanded
at
the
last
moment
a
pity
such
fine
flowers
her
interest
was
awakened
in
the
rather
shabby
young
man
who
paid
the
price
without
flinching
and
she
threw
inquisitive
looks
at
him
as
she
wrapped
the
roses
in
a
moment
later
maurice
was
in
the
street
with
the
flowers
in
his
hand
he
had
acted
so
spontaneously
that
he
now
believed
his
mind
to
have
been
made
up
before
he
entered
the
shop
no
more
as
if
all
that
had
happened
during
the
past
week
had
led
straight
up
to
his
impulsive
action
or
was
it
only
that
at
the
sight
of
the
flowers
a
kind
of
refrain
had
begun
to
run
through
his
head
she
loves
roses
loves
roses
but
he
did
not
give
himself
time
for
reflection
he
hurried
through
the
cold
night
air
sheltering
the
flowers
under
his
coat
soon
he
was
once
more
in
the
bruderstrasse
on
the
stair
every
step
of
which
though
he
had
only
climbed
it
some
three
or
four
times
he
seemed
to
know
by
heart
as
however
he
waited
for
the
door
to
be
opened
his
heart
misgave
him
he
was
not
sure
how
she
would
regard
his
gift
and
in
a
burst
of
cowardice
he
resolved
just
to
hand
in
the
roses
without
even
leaving
his
name
but
his
first
ring
remained
unanswered
and
before
he
rang
again
he
had
time
to
be
afraid
she
would
not
be
at
home
a
simple
but
disappointing
solution
there
was
another
pause
then
he
heard
sounds
steps
came
along
the
passage
and
the
door
was
opened
by
louise
herself
he
was
so
unprepared
for
this
that
he
could
not
collect
his
wits
he
thrust
the
flowers
into
her
hand
with
a
few
stammered
words
and
his
foot
was
on
the
stair
before
she
could
make
a
movement
to
stop
him
louise
had
peered
out
from
the
darkness
of
the
passage
to
the
dusk
of
the
landing
with
the
air
of
one
roused
from
sleep
she
looked
from
him
to
the
roses
in
her
hand
and
back
at
him
he
tried
to
say
something
else
raised
his
hat
and
was
about
to
go
but
when
she
saw
this
she
impulsively
stepped
towards
him
are
they
for
me
she
asked
and
added
will
you
not
come
in
please
come
in
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
maurice
came
back
from
the
but
it
was
not
possible
for
him
to
stay
friends
engaged
a
promise
of
long
standing
ah
then
of
course
she
retreated
into
the
shadow
of
the
doorway
but
i
am
quite
alone
there
is
no
one
in
but
me
why
however
does
that
happen
maurice
asked
quickly
and
was
ready
at
once
to
be
wrath
with
all
the
world
he
paused
irresolute
with
his
hand
on
the
banisters
i
said
i
did
mind
but
it
is
lonely
i
should
think
it
on
this
night
of
all
others
too
he
followed
her
down
the
passage
in
the
room
there
was
no
light
except
what
played
on
the
walls
from
the
streetlamps
the
blinds
being
still
undrawn
she
had
been
sitting
in
the
dark
now
she
took
the
globe
off
the
lamp
and
would
have
lighted
it
but
she
could
not
find
matches
let
me
do
it
said
maurice
taking
out
his
own
and
over
the
head
of
this
trifling
service
he
had
a
feeling
of
intense
satisfaction
by
the
light
that
was
cast
on
the
table
he
watched
her
free
the
roses
from
their
paper
and
raise
them
to
her
face
she
did
not
mention
them
again
but
it
was
ample
thanks
to
see
her
touch
several
of
them
singly
as
she
put
them
in
a
jug
of
water
but
this
done
they
sat
on
opposite
sides
of
the
table
and
had
nothing
to
say
to
each
other
after
each
banal
observation
he
made
came
a
pause
she
let
a
subject
drop
as
soon
as
it
was
broached
it
was
over
two
months
now
since
maurice
had
seen
her
and
he
was
startled
by
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
her
her
face
seemed
to
have
grown
longer
and
there
were
hollows
in
the
fine
oval
of
the
cheeks
in
consequence
of
which
the
nose
looked
larger
and
more
pinched
the
were
sharpened
the
eyes
more
sunken
while
the
shadows
beneath
them
were
as
dark
as
though
they
were
plastered
on
with
bistre
but
it
was
chiefly
the
expression
of
the
face
that
had
altered
the
lifelessness
of
the
eyes
was
new
to
it
and
the
firm
compression
of
the
mouth
now
when
she
smiled
no
thin
line
of
white
appeared
such
as
he
had
been
used
to
watch
for
even
more
marked
than
this
though
was
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
her
manner
he
had
known
her
as
passionately
and
he
could
not
now
accustom
himself
to
the
condition
of
apathy
in
which
he
found
her
moping
to
death
had
been
no
exaggeration
help
was
needed
here
and
at
once
if
she
were
not
to
be
irretrievably
injured
as
he
thought
these
things
he
talked
at
random
there
were
not
many
topics
however
that
could
be
touched
on
with
impunity
and
he
returned
more
than
once
to
the
ice
and
the
skating
as
offering
a
kind
of
neutral
ground
on
which
he
was
safe
and
louise
listened
and
sometimes
assented
but
her
look
was
that
of
one
who
listens
to
the
affairs
of
another
world
could
she
not
be
persuaded
to
join
them
on
the
johannateich
he
was
asking
her
what
matter
though
she
did
not
skate
it
was
easily
learned
madeleine
had
been
a
beginner
that
winter
and
now
seldom
missed
an
afternoon
oh
if
madeleine
is
there
i
should
not
go
she
said
with
a
touch
of
the
old
arrogance
then
he
told
her
of
the
frozen
river
with
its
long
lonely
reaches
her
eyes
kindled
at
this
he
fancied
and
in
her
answer
was
more
of
herself
i
have
never
trodden
on
ice
in
my
life
oh
i
should
be
afraid
horribly
afraid
for
those
who
did
not
skate
there
were
chairs
he
urged
big
chairs
which
ran
smoothly
the
ice
was
many
inches
thick
there
was
not
the
least
need
to
be
afraid
but
she
only
smiled
and
did
not
answer
then
i
ca
persuade
you
he
asked
and
was
annoyed
at
his
own
powerlessness
she
can
go
with
eggis
he
told
himself
and
simultaneously
spoke
out
the
thought
i
saw
you
on
the
bridge
the
other
day
but
if
he
had
imagined
this
would
rouse
her
he
was
wrong
yes
she
said
indifferently
and
with
that
laming
want
of
curiosity
which
prevents
a
subject
from
being
followed
up
they
sat
in
silence
for
some
seconds
with
her
fingers
she
pulled
at
the
fringe
of
the
tablecloth
then
all
of
a
sudden
rising
from
her
chair
she
went
over
to
the
jug
of
roses
which
she
had
placed
on
the
bent
over
the
flowers
with
a
kind
of
perceptible
hesitation
and
as
suddenly
came
back
to
her
seat
suppose
we
went
she
said
and
for
the
first
time
looked
hard
at
maurice
he
had
echoed
before
he
could
check
himself
ah
yes
i
forgot
you
are
going
out
that
the
least
of
it
he
answered
and
stood
up
fearful
lest
she
should
sink
back
into
her
former
listlessness
but
it
christmas
eve
there
would
be
a
soul
on
the
river
but
ourselves
are
you
sure
you
would
like
it
just
for
that
reason
she
replied
and
wound
her
handkerchief
in
and
out
of
her
hands
so
afraid
was
she
now
that
he
would
refuse
i
could
be
ready
in
five
minutes
with
his
brain
in
a
whirl
maurice
went
back
to
the
flowershop
and
having
written
a
few
words
of
apology
on
a
card
ordered
this
to
be
sent
with
his
purchase
to
miss
jensen
when
he
returned
louise
was
ready
but
he
was
not
satisfied
she
did
not
know
how
cold
it
would
be
and
he
made
her
put
on
a
heavy
jacket
under
her
fur
cape
and
take
a
silk
shawl
in
which
if
necessary
she
could
muffle
up
her
head
he
himself
carried
a
for
her
knees
as
if
we
were
going
on
a
journey
she
said
as
she
obeyed
him
her
eyes
shone
with
a
spark
of
their
old
light
in
approval
of
the
adventurous
nature
of
their
undertaking
the
streets
over
which
a
cutting
wind
drove
were
deserted
in
many
windows
the
golden
glory
of
the
christbaum
was
visible
the
steep
blackness
of
the
houses
was
splashed
with
patches
of
light
at
intervals
a
belated
holidaymaker
was
still
to
be
met
with
hurrying
townwards
only
they
two
were
leaving
the
town
and
its
innocent
revels
behind
them
maurice
had
a
somewhat
guilty
feeling
about
the
whole
affair
they
also
belonged
by
rights
to
the
town
he
was
aware
too
of
a
vague
anxiety
which
he
could
not
repress
and
these
feelings
successfully
prevented
him
taking
an
undue
pleasure
in
what
was
happening
to
him
he
had
swung
his
skates
fetched
in
passing
over
his
shoulder
and
they
walked
as
quickly
as
the
slippery
snow
permitted
louise
had
not
spoken
since
leaving
the
house
she
also
stood
mutely
by
while
the
astonished
boatman
knocked
out
in
the
middle
of
his
festivities
unlocked
the
where
the
were
kept
the
christmas
punch
had
made
him
merry
he
multiplied
words
and
was
even
a
little
facetious
at
their
expense
according
to
him
a
was
imminent
and
he
warned
them
not
to
be
late
in
returning
maurice
helped
louise
into
the
chair
and
wrapped
the
rug
round
her
if
she
were
really
afraid
as
she
had
asserted
she
did
not
show
it
even
after
they
had
started
she
remained
as
silent
as
before
indeed
on
looking
back
maurice
thought
they
had
not
exchanged
a
word
all
the
way
to
connewitz
he
pushed
in
a
kind
of
dream
the
wind
was
with
them
and
it
was
comparatively
easy
work
but
the
ice
was
rough
and
too
hard
and
there
were
seamy
cracks
to
be
avoided
the
snow
had
drifted
into
huge
piles
at
the
sides
and
as
they
advanced
it
lay
unswept
on
their
track
it
was
a
hazily
bright
night
but
rapid
clouds
were
passing
not
a
creature
was
to
be
seen
had
a
rift
opened
in
the
ice
and
had
they
two
gone
through
it
the
mystery
of
their
disappearance
would
never
have
been
solved
slight
upright
unfathomable
as
the
night
louise
sat
before
him
what
her
thoughts
were
on
this
fantastic
journey
he
never
knew
nor
just
what
secret
nerve
in
her
was
satisfied
by
it
by
leaning
sideways
he
could
see
that
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
stretch
to
be
travelled
her
warm
breath
came
back
to
him
and
the
coil
of
her
hair
with
its
piquant
odour
was
so
close
that
by
bending
he
could
have
touched
it
with
his
lips
but
he
was
still
in
too
detached
a
mood
to
be
happy
he
felt
throughout
as
if
all
this
were
happening
to
some
one
else
not
to
him
at
their
journey
end
he
helped
her
cold
and
stiff
along
the
snowy
path
to
the
waldcafe
in
a
corner
of
the
big
room
which
was
empty
they
sat
beside
the
stove
before
cups
of
steaming
coffee
the
landlady
served
them
herself
and
looked
with
the
same
curious
interest
as
the
boatman
at
the
forlorn
pair
louise
had
laid
her
fur
cap
aside
with
her
other
wraps
and
had
drawn
off
her
gloves
and
now
she
sat
with
her
hand
propping
her
chin
she
was
still
disinclined
to
speak
from
the
expression
of
her
eyes
maurice
judged
that
her
thought
were
very
far
away
sitting
opposite
her
he
shaded
his
own
eyes
with
his
hand
and
scrutinised
her
closely
in
the
stronger
light
of
this
room
he
could
see
more
plainly
than
before
the
havoc
trouble
had
made
of
her
face
and
yet
in
spite
of
the
shadows
that
had
descended
on
it
it
was
still
to
him
the
most
adorable
face
in
the
world
he
could
not
analyse
his
feelings
any
better
now
than
in
the
beginning
but
this
face
had
exactly
the
same
effect
upon
him
now
as
then
it
seemed
to
be
a
matter
of
the
nerves
nor
was
it
the
face
alone
it
was
also
the
lines
of
throat
and
chin
when
she
turned
her
head
it
was
the
gesture
with
which
she
fingered
the
knot
of
hair
on
her
neck
above
all
her
hands
whose
every
movement
was
full
of
meaning
yes
these
things
sent
answering
ripples
through
him
as
sound
does
through
air
he
had
stared
too
openly
she
felt
his
eyes
and
raised
her
own
for
a
few
seconds
they
looked
at
each
other
then
she
held
out
her
hand
you
are
my
friend
he
pressed
it
without
replying
he
could
not
think
of
anything
suitable
to
say
what
rose
to
his
lips
was
too
emotional
too
but
he
made
a
vow
that
from
this
day
on
she
should
never
doubt
the
truth
of
what
she
said
you
are
my
friend
he
would
take
care
of
her
as
no
one
had
ever
yet
tried
to
do
she
might
safely
give
herself
into
his
charge
the
unobtrusive
aid
that
was
mingled
tenderness
and
respect
should
always
be
hers
are
you
warmer
now
he
could
not
altogether
suppress
the
new
note
that
had
got
into
his
voice
all
strangeness
seemed
to
have
been
swept
away
between
them
he
was
to
the
fact
that
he
was
sitting
alone
with
her
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
world
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
time
to
go
but
she
begged
for
a
little
longer
and
so
they
sat
on
for
another
in
the
warm
and
drowsy
stillness
outside
they
found
a
leaden
sky
and
they
had
not
gone
far
before
snow
began
to
fall
great
flakes
came
flying
to
them
smiting
their
faces
stinging
their
eyes
melting
on
their
lips
the
wind
was
against
them
they
were
exposed
to
the
full
force
of
the
blizzard
maurice
pushed
till
he
panted
but
their
progress
was
slow
at
intervals
he
stopped
to
shake
the
snow
off
the
rug
and
to
enwrap
louise
afresh
and
each
violent
gust
that
met
him
when
he
turned
a
corner
smote
him
doubly
for
he
pictured
to
himself
the
fury
with
which
it
must
hurl
itself
against
her
sitting
motionless
before
it
it
took
them
twice
as
long
to
return
and
when
louise
tried
to
get
out
of
the
chair
she
found
herself
so
paralysed
with
cold
that
she
could
hardly
stand
blinded
by
the
snow
she
clung
to
maurice
arm
he
heard
her
teeth
chatter
as
they
toiled
their
way
along
the
arndtstrasse
through
the
thick
new
not
a
droschke
was
to
be
seen
and
they
were
home
before
they
met
one
the
driver
was
drunk
or
asleep
and
had
first
to
be
roused
louise
sank
limply
into
a
corner
the
cab
slithered
and
slipped
over
the
dangerous
roads
jolting
them
from
side
to
side
maurice
had
laid
the
rug
across
her
knees
and
she
had
ceased
to
shiver
but
by
the
light
of
a
which
they
passed
he
was
dismayed
to
see
that
tears
were
running
down
her
cheeks
what
is
it
are
you
so
cold
just
a
little
patience
we
shall
soon
be
there
he
took
her
hand
and
chafed
it
at
this
she
began
to
cry
he
did
not
know
how
to
comfort
her
and
looked
out
of
the
window
scanning
each
house
they
passed
to
see
if
it
were
not
the
last
she
was
still
crying
when
the
cab
drew
up
the
had
been
forgotten
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
ring
for
the
landlady
and
to
stand
in
the
wind
till
she
came
down
the
old
woman
was
not
so
astonished
as
maurice
had
expected
but
she
was
very
wroth
at
the
folly
of
the
proceeding
and
did
not
scruple
to
say
so
so
dummheit
so
dummheit
she
mumbled
as
between
them
they
got
louise
up
the
stairs
and
she
treated
maurice
advice
concerning
cordials
and
hot
drinks
with
scant
courtesy
ja
ja
jawohl
she
sniffed
and
on
the
landing
the
door
was
shut
in
his
face
viii
what
she
needed
what
she
had
always
needed
was
a
friend
he
said
to
himself
she
had
never
had
anyone
to
stand
by
her
and
advise
her
to
wisdom
in
the
matter
of
impulsive
acts
and
wishes
he
would
be
that
friend
he
had
not
it
was
true
made
a
very
happy
beginning
with
the
expedition
that
had
ended
so
unfortunately
but
he
promised
himself
not
to
be
led
into
an
indiscretion
of
the
kind
again
it
was
a
part
to
warn
in
due
time
and
to
point
out
the
possible
consequences
of
a
rash
act
he
only
excused
his
behaviour
because
he
had
not
seen
her
for
over
two
months
and
had
felt
too
sorry
for
her
to
refuse
the
first
thing
she
asked
of
him
but
from
now
on
he
would
be
firm
he
would
win
her
back
to
life
reawaken
her
interest
in
what
was
going
on
around
her
he
would
devote
himself
to
serving
her
not
selfishly
as
others
had
done
with
their
own
ends
in
view
the
gentle
steady
aid
should
be
hers
which
he
had
always
longed
to
give
her
he
felt
strong
enough
to
face
any
contingency
it
seemed
indeed
as
if
his
love
for
her
had
all
along
been
aiming
at
this
issue
as
if
each
of
the
unhappy
hours
he
had
spent
since
first
meeting
her
was
made
up
for
by
the
words
you
are
my
friend
a
deep
sense
of
responsibility
filled
him
in
obedience
however
to
a
puritanic
streak
in
his
nature
he
hedged
himself
round
with
restrictions
lest
he
should
believe
he
was
setting
out
on
all
too
primrose
a
path
he
erected
limiting
boundaries
which
were
not
to
be
overstepped
for
example
on
the
two
days
that
followed
the
memorable
christmas
eve
he
only
made
inquiries
at
the
door
after
louise
and
when
he
learned
that
the
cold
she
had
caught
was
better
did
not
return
for
on
one
point
his
mind
was
made
up
idle
tongues
should
have
no
fresh
cause
for
gossip
at
the
expiry
of
a
fortnight
however
he
began
to
fear
that
if
he
remained
away
any
longer
she
would
think
him
indifferent
to
her
offer
of
friendship
so
late
one
afternoon
he
called
to
see
her
but
when
he
was
face
to
face
with
her
he
doubted
whether
she
had
given
him
a
thought
in
the
interval
she
seemed
mildly
surprised
at
his
coming
it
was
even
possible
that
she
had
forgotten
by
now
what
she
had
said
to
him
and
he
sought
anew
for
a
means
of
impressing
himself
on
her
consciousness
she
was
crouched
in
the
close
beside
the
stove
and
was
wrapped
in
a
thick
woollen
shawl
but
the
hand
she
gave
him
was
as
cold
as
stone
she
was
trying
to
keep
warm
she
said
she
had
not
been
properly
warm
since
the
night
on
the
ice
but
there
an
easy
remedy
for
that
said
maurice
who
came
in
ruddy
from
the
sharp
air
you
must
go
out
and
walk
then
you
will
soon
get
warm
but
she
shuddered
at
the
suggestion
and
also
made
an
expressive
gesture
to
indicate
the
general
laxity
of
her
dress
the
soiled
her
untidy
hair
then
she
leaned
forward
again
holding
both
hands
palms
out
to
the
mica
pane
in
the
door
of
the
stove
through
which
the
red
coals
glowed
if
only
winter
were
over
he
gazed
at
the
expressive
lines
of
hand
and
wrist
and
was
reminded
of
an
adoring
madonna
he
had
somewhere
seen
engraved
her
hands
were
held
back
in
the
same
way
the
thumbs
slightly
thrown
out
the
three
long
fingers
together
the
little
one
apart
here
as
there
was
the
same
supple
passionate
indolence
but
he
could
find
no
more
to
say
than
on
the
occasion
of
his
former
visit
she
did
not
help
him
and
more
and
more
did
it
seem
to
the
young
man
as
if
the
words
he
had
gone
about
hugging
to
him
had
never
been
spoken
after
a
desperate
quarter
of
an
hour
he
rose
to
take
leave
but
simultaneously
she
too
got
up
from
the
and
standing
pale
and
uncertain
before
him
asked
him
if
she
might
trouble
him
to
do
something
for
her
a
box
had
been
sent
to
her
from
england
she
told
him
while
she
tumbled
over
the
dusty
letters
and
papers
accumulated
on
the
and
had
been
lying
unclaimed
at
the
for
several
weeks
now
how
many
she
did
not
know
and
she
spread
out
her
fingers
with
a
funny
little
movement
to
show
her
ignorance
she
had
only
remembered
it
a
day
or
two
ago
the
dues
would
no
doubt
be
considerable
if
it
were
not
too
much
trouble
she
would
be
so
grateful
she
would
rather
ask
him
than
eggis
i
should
be
delighted
said
maurice
he
went
the
next
morning
at
nine
spent
a
trying
hour
with
uncivil
officials
and
in
the
afternoon
called
to
report
to
louise
as
he
was
saying
to
her
he
inquired
if
there
were
nothing
else
of
a
similar
nature
he
could
do
for
her
he
was
glad
to
be
of
use
smiling
louise
admitted
that
there
were
other
things
many
of
them
more
than
he
would
have
patience
for
she
should
try
him
and
see
said
maurice
and
laid
his
hat
down
again
to
hear
what
they
were
as
a
consequence
of
this
the
following
days
saw
him
on
various
commissions
in
different
quarters
of
the
town
scanning
the
names
of
shops
searching
for
streets
he
did
not
know
but
matters
did
not
always
run
smoothly
complications
arose
for
instance
over
a
paid
bill
that
had
been
sent
in
a
second
time
and
over
an
earlier
one
that
had
not
been
paid
at
all
and
maurice
was
forced
to
confess
his
ignorance
of
the
circumstances
when
this
had
happened
more
than
once
he
sat
down
with
her
consent
at
the
to
work
through
the
mass
of
papers
and
the
contents
of
a
couple
of
drawers
in
doing
this
he
became
acquainted
with
some
of
the
more
intimate
details
of
her
life
minute
and
troublesome
details
for
which
she
had
no
aptitude
from
her
scat
at
the
stove
louise
watched
him
sorting
and
reckoning
and
she
was
as
grateful
to
him
as
it
was
possible
for
her
to
be
in
her
present
mood
no
one
had
ever
done
a
thing
of
the
kind
for
her
before
and
she
was
callous
to
the
fact
of
its
being
a
stranger
who
had
his
hands
thus
in
her
private
life
when
horrified
beyond
measure
at
the
confusion
that
reigned
in
all
belonging
to
her
maurice
asked
her
how
she
had
ever
succeeded
in
keeping
order
she
told
him
that
before
her
illness
there
had
now
and
again
come
a
day
of
strength
and
purpose
on
which
she
had
had
the
courage
to
face
these
distasteful
trifles
and
to
end
them
but
she
did
not
believe
such
a
day
would
ever
come
again
bills
bills
bills
dozens
of
bills
of
varying
dates
sent
in
once
twice
three
times
and
invariably
tossed
aside
and
forgotten
a
mode
of
proceeding
incomprehensible
to
maurice
who
had
never
bought
anything
on
credit
in
his
life
and
not
because
she
was
in
want
of
money
there
were
plenty
of
gold
pieces
jingling
loose
in
a
drawer
but
from
an
aversion
which
was
almost
an
inability
to
take
in
what
the
figures
meant
and
the
amounts
added
up
to
alarming
totals
maurice
had
no
idea
what
a
woman
dress
cost
and
could
only
stand
amazed
but
the
sum
spent
on
fruit
and
flowers
alone
in
two
months
represented
to
his
eyes
a
small
fortune
then
there
was
the
bluthner
the
unused
piano
the
hire
of
it
had
not
been
paid
since
the
previous
summer
three
terms
were
owed
at
klemm
musical
library
from
which
no
music
was
now
borrowed
fees
were
still
being
charged
against
her
at
the
conservatorium
where
she
had
given
no
formal
notice
of
leaving
it
really
did
not
matter
she
said
with
that
carelessness
concerning
money
which
was
characteristic
of
her
but
it
went
against
the
grain
in
maurice
to
let
several
pounds
be
lost
for
want
of
an
effort
and
he
spent
a
diplomatic
with
the
secretaries
in
the
bureau
getting
her
released
from
paying
the
whole
of
the
term
that
had
now
begun
as
however
she
would
not
appear
personally
she
was
under
the
necessity
of
writing
a
letter
stating
that
she
had
left
the
conservatorium
and
when
she
had
promised
twice
to
do
it
and
it
was
still
unwritten
maurice
stood
over
her
and
dictated
the
words
into
her
pen
a
day
or
two
afterwards
he
prevailed
upon
her
to
do
the
same
for
schwarz
to
inform
him
of
her
illness
and
to
say
that
at
easter
if
she
were
better
she
would
come
to
him
for
a
course
of
private
lessons
this
was
an
idea
of
maurice
own
and
louise
looked
up
at
him
before
putting
down
the
words
it
not
true
but
if
you
think
i
should
say
so
it
does
matter
this
was
the
burden
of
all
she
said
nothing
mattered
nothing
would
ever
matter
again
there
was
not
the
least
need
for
the
tone
in
which
maurice
clothed
his
air
of
authority
she
obeyed
him
blindly
doing
what
he
bade
her
without
question
glad
to
be
subordinate
to
his
will
as
long
as
he
did
not
ask
her
to
think
or
to
feel
or
to
stir
from
her
chair
beside
the
stove
but
it
was
only
with
regard
to
small
practical
things
in
matters
of
more
importance
she
was
not
to
be
moved
and
the
day
came
only
too
soon
when
the
positive
help
maurice
could
give
her
was
at
an
end
she
did
not
owe
a
pfennig
to
anyone
her
letters
and
accounts
were
filed
and
in
order
then
she
seemed
to
elude
him
again
he
did
what
lay
in
his
power
brought
her
books
that
she
did
not
read
brought
news
and
scraps
of
which
he
thought
might
interest
her
and
which
did
not
and
an
endless
store
of
sympathy
but
to
all
he
said
and
did
she
made
the
same
response
it
did
not
matter
since
the
night
on
the
river
she
had
not
set
foot
across
the
threshold
of
her
room
nervous
fears
beset
her
maurice
was
bent
on
her
going
out
into
the
open
air
he
also
wished
her
to
mix
with
people
again
and
thus
rid
herself
of
the
morbid
fancies
that
were
creeping
on
her
but
she
shrank
as
he
spoke
of
it
and
pressed
both
hands
to
her
face
it
was
too
cold
she
murmured
and
too
cheerless
and
then
the
streets
the
publicity
of
the
streets
the
noise
the
people
this
was
what
she
said
to
him
to
herself
she
added
and
all
the
old
familiar
places
to
each
of
which
a
memory
was
attached
he
spent
hours
in
urging
her
to
take
up
some
regular
occupation
it
would
be
her
salvation
he
believed
and
not
allowing
himself
to
be
discouraged
he
returned
to
the
attack
day
after
day
but
she
only
smiled
the
thin
smile
with
which
she
defeated
most
of
his
proposals
for
her
good
work
what
had
she
to
do
with
work
it
had
never
been
anything
to
her
but
a
narcotic
enabling
her
to
get
through
those
hours
of
the
day
in
which
she
was
alone
she
let
maurice
talk
on
and
hardly
heard
what
he
said
he
meant
well
but
he
did
not
understand
no
one
understood
no
one
but
herself
knew
the
weight
of
the
burden
she
had
borne
since
the
day
when
her
happiness
was
mercilessly
destroyed
now
she
could
not
raise
a
finger
to
help
herself
on
waking
in
the
morning
she
turned
with
loathing
from
the
new
day
in
the
of
the
room
she
lay
motionless
half
sleeping
or
dreaming
with
open
eyes
the
clock
ticked
benumbingly
the
long
hours
away
the
wind
howled
or
the
wind
was
still
snow
fell
or
it
was
frostily
clear
but
nothing
happened
nothing
at
all
the
day
was
well
advanced
before
she
left
her
bed
for
the
seat
by
the
stove
there
she
brooded
until
she
dragged
herself
back
to
bed
one
day
was
the
exact
counterpart
of
another
the
only
break
in
the
deathlike
monotony
was
maurice
visit
he
came
in
fresh
and
eager
to
see
her
he
held
her
hand
and
said
kind
things
to
her
he
talked
persuasively
and
she
listened
or
not
as
she
felt
disposed
but
little
though
he
was
able
to
touch
her
she
unconsciously
began
to
look
to
his
visits
and
one
day
when
he
was
detained
and
could
not
come
she
was
aware
of
a
feeling
of
injury
at
his
absence
as
time
went
by
however
maurice
felt
more
and
more
clearly
that
he
was
making
no
headway
his
uneasiness
increased
for
her
want
of
spirit
had
something
about
it
that
he
could
not
understand
it
began
to
look
to
him
like
a
somewhat
morbid
indulgence
in
grief
this
ca
go
on
he
said
sternly
she
was
in
one
of
her
most
pitiable
moods
for
there
were
gradations
in
her
unhappiness
as
he
had
learned
to
know
this
ca
go
on
you
are
killing
yourself
by
inches
and
i
a
party
to
it
for
the
first
time
there
was
a
hint
of
impatience
in
his
manner
to
his
surprise
louise
raised
her
head
raised
it
quickly
as
he
had
not
seen
her
make
a
movement
for
weeks
by
inches
inches
only
oh
i
am
so
strong
nothing
hurts
me
nothing
is
of
any
use
if
you
look
in
the
glass
you
will
see
that
you
hurting
yourself
considerably
you
mean
that
i
getting
old
and
ugly
she
caught
him
up
do
you
think
i
care
oh
if
i
had
only
had
the
courage
that
day
a
few
grains
of
something
and
it
would
have
been
all
over
long
ago
but
i
was
brave
enough
and
now
i
have
no
more
courage
in
me
than
strength
in
my
little
finger
maurice
looked
meditatively
at
her
without
replying
this
was
the
single
occasion
on
which
she
had
been
roused
to
a
retort
of
any
kind
and
bitter
though
her
words
were
he
could
not
prevent
the
spark
of
hope
which
by
their
means
was
lit
in
him
and
from
this
day
on
things
went
forward
of
themselves
again
and
again
some
harmless
observation
on
his
part
drew
forth
a
caustic
reply
from
her
it
was
as
if
having
once
experienced
it
she
found
an
outcry
of
this
kind
a
relief
to
her
surcharged
nerves
at
first
what
she
said
was
directed
chiefly
against
herself
this
self
for
which
she
now
nursed
a
fanatic
hatred
since
it
had
failed
her
in
her
need
but
little
by
little
he
too
was
drawn
within
the
circle
of
her
bitterness
indeed
it
sometimes
seemed
as
if
his
very
kindness
incited
her
by
laying
her
under
an
obligation
to
him
which
it
was
in
her
nature
to
resent
at
others
again
as
if
she
merely
wished
to
try
him
to
see
how
far
she
might
go
do
i
really
deserve
that
thrust
he
once
could
not
help
asking
he
smiled
as
he
spoke
to
take
the
edge
off
his
words
louise
threw
a
penitent
glance
at
him
and
for
all
answer
held
out
her
hand
but
the
very
next
day
after
a
similar
incident
she
crossed
the
room
to
him
with
the
swiftness
of
movement
that
was
always
disturbing
in
her
contrasting
as
it
did
with
her
customary
indolence
forgive
me
i
ought
not
to
and
you
are
the
only
friend
i
have
but
there
so
much
i
must
say
to
some
one
if
i
do
say
it
i
shall
go
mad
why
of
course
that
what
i
here
for
said
maurice
and
so
it
went
on
a
strange
state
of
things
in
which
he
never
called
her
by
her
name
and
seldom
touched
her
hand
he
had
himself
well
under
control
except
for
the
moment
immediately
before
he
saw
her
and
the
moment
after
he
could
not
yet
meet
her
after
the
briefest
absence
unmoved
for
a
week
on
end
that
penetrating
rawness
had
been
abroad
which
precedes
and
accompanies
a
thaw
and
one
day
early
in
february
when
after
the
unequalled
severity
of
the
winter
the
air
seemed
of
an
incredible
mildness
the
thaw
was
there
in
earnest
on
the
ice
of
more
than
three
months
standing
pools
of
water
had
formed
overnight
by
the
johannateich
maurice
and
madeleine
stood
looking
dubiously
across
the
bank
of
snow
which
here
and
there
had
already
collapsed
leaving
miniature
flecked
with
moisture
several
people
who
could
not
tear
themselves
away
were
still
flying
about
the
ice
dexterously
avoiding
the
watery
places
and
dove
and
pretty
susie
fay
called
out
to
them
that
it
was
better
than
it
looked
but
maurice
was
fastidious
and
madeleine
indifferent
she
was
really
rather
tired
of
skating
she
admitted
as
they
walked
home
and
was
ashamed
to
think
of
the
time
she
had
wasted
on
it
as
however
this
particular
afternoon
was
already
broken
into
she
would
have
been
glad
to
go
for
a
walk
but
maurice
did
not
take
up
her
suggestion
and
parted
from
her
at
her
spring
is
in
the
air
he
sought
to
tempt
louise
when
a
few
minutes
later
he
entered
her
room
she
too
had
been
aware
of
the
change
for
it
had
aggravated
her
dejection
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
like
a
tired
child
and
had
not
strength
enough
to
make
her
usual
stand
against
him
oh
if
he
really
wished
it
so
much
she
would
go
out
she
said
at
last
and
so
he
left
her
to
dress
and
ran
to
the
conservatorium
arriving
just
in
time
for
a
class
later
on
a
curious
uneasiness
drew
him
back
to
see
how
she
had
fared
it
was
almost
dark
but
she
had
not
returned
and
he
waited
for
half
an
hour
before
he
heard
her
step
in
the
hall
directly
she
came
in
he
knew
that
something
was
the
matter
in
each
of
her
movements
was
a
concentrated
but
noiseless
energy
she
shut
the
door
after
her
as
if
it
were
never
to
open
again
tore
off
rather
than
unpinned
the
thick
black
veil
in
which
she
had
shrouded
herself
threw
her
hat
on
the
sofa
furs
and
jacket
to
the
hat
then
stood
motionless
pressing
her
handkerchief
to
her
lips
her
face
had
emerged
from
its
wrappings
with
renewed
pallor
her
eyes
shone
as
if
with
belladonna
she
took
no
notice
of
the
silent
figure
in
the
corner
did
not
even
look
in
his
direction
you
got
back
said
maurice
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
it
too
late
at
his
words
she
dropped
on
a
chair
put
her
arms
on
the
table
and
hid
her
face
in
them
what
the
matter
has
anything
happened
he
asked
in
quick
alarm
as
she
burst
into
violent
sobs
he
should
have
been
accustomed
to
her
way
of
crying
by
this
time
it
sounded
worse
than
it
was
as
he
knew
but
it
invariably
racked
him
anew
he
stood
over
her
but
the
only
comfort
he
ventured
on
was
to
lay
his
hand
on
her
hair
this
wild
black
hair
which
met
his
fingers
springily
with
a
will
of
its
own
what
is
the
matter
he
besought
her
tell
me
louise
tell
me
what
it
is
he
had
to
ask
several
times
before
he
received
an
answer
finally
she
sobbed
in
a
muffled
voice
without
raising
her
head
how
could
you
make
me
go
out
oh
how
could
you
what
do
you
mean
i
do
understand
what
is
it
he
had
visions
of
her
being
annoyed
or
insulted
but
she
only
repeated
how
could
you
oh
it
was
cruel
of
you
and
wept
afresh
word
by
word
maurice
drew
her
story
from
her
there
was
not
very
much
to
tell
she
had
gone
out
and
had
walked
hurriedly
along
quiet
to
the
rosental
but
before
she
had
advanced
a
hundred
yards
her
courage
began
to
fail
and
the
further
she
went
the
more
her
spirits
sank
her
surroundings
were
indescribably
depressing
the
smirched
steadily
retreating
snow
was
leaving
bare
all
the
drab
brownness
it
had
concealed
all
the
dismal
little
gardens
and
dirty
corners
houses
streets
and
people
wore
their
most
bedraggled
air
particularly
the
people
they
were
as
ugly
as
the
areas
of
roof
and
stone
off
which
the
soft
white
coating
had
slid
their
contours
were
as
painful
to
see
and
the
mud
oh
god
the
mud
it
spread
itself
over
every
inch
of
the
way
the
roads
were
rivers
of
filth
which
spattered
and
splashed
at
the
sides
of
the
streets
the
slush
was
being
swept
into
beds
before
she
had
gone
any
distance
her
boots
and
skirts
were
heavy
with
it
and
she
hated
mud
she
sobbed
hated
it
loathed
it
it
affected
her
with
a
physical
disgust
and
this
lie
might
have
known
when
he
sent
her
out
in
the
rosental
it
was
no
better
the
paths
were
so
soaked
that
they
squashed
under
her
feet
on
both
sides
lay
layers
of
rotten
leaves
from
the
autumn
the
trees
were
only
a
of
blackened
twigs
their
trunks
surrounded
by
an
undergrowth
that
was
as
ragged
as
unkempt
hair
and
everything
was
mouldering
the
smell
of
moist
earthy
decay
reminded
her
of
open
graves
not
a
soul
was
visible
but
herself
she
sat
on
a
seat
the
only
living
creature
in
the
scene
and
the
past
rose
before
her
with
resistless
force
the
intensity
of
her
happiness
the
base
cruelty
of
his
conduct
her
misery
her
unspeakable
misery
her
forlorn
desolation
which
was
of
a
piece
with
the
desolation
around
her
and
which
would
never
again
be
otherwise
though
she
lived
to
be
an
old
how
long
she
sat
thinking
things
of
this
kind
she
did
not
know
but
all
of
a
sudden
she
started
up
frightened
both
by
her
wretched
thoughts
and
by
the
loneliness
of
the
wood
and
she
fled
not
looking
behind
her
or
pausing
to
take
breath
till
she
reached
the
streets
into
the
first
empty
droschke
she
met
she
had
sunk
exhausted
and
been
driven
home
it
was
of
no
use
trying
to
reason
with
her
or
to
console
her
i
ca
bear
my
life
she
sobbed
it
too
hard
and
there
is
no
one
to
help
me
if
i
had
done
anything
to
deserve
it
then
it
would
be
different
then
i
should
complain
but
i
did
did
do
anything
unless
it
was
that
i
cared
too
much
at
least
it
was
a
mistake
a
dreadful
mistake
i
should
never
have
shown
him
how
i
cared
i
should
have
made
him
believe
he
loved
me
best
but
i
was
a
fool
i
flung
it
all
at
his
feet
and
it
was
only
natural
he
should
get
tired
of
me
the
wonder
was
that
i
held
him
so
long
but
oh
how
can
one
care
as
i
did
and
yet
be
able
to
plot
and
plan
i
could
it
in
me
to
do
it
she
wept
despairingly
with
her
head
on
her
outstretched
arms
when
she
raised
it
again
her
face
looked
out
from
its
setting
of
ruffled
hair
more
to
herself
than
to
the
young
man
as
if
on
this
day
secret
springs
had
been
touched
in
her
she
continued
with
terse
disconnectedness
i
could
believe
it
i
would
even
when
i
heard
it
from
his
own
lips
you
thought
all
of
you
that
i
was
ill
but
i
was
i
was
only
trying
to
get
used
to
the
terrible
thought
just
as
a
suddenly
blinded
man
has
to
get
used
to
being
always
in
the
dark
and
while
i
was
still
struggling
came
madeleine
with
her
cruel
tongue
and
told
me
you
know
what
she
told
me
oh
if
his
leaving
me
had
been
hard
to
bear
this
stung
like
scorpions
i
wonder
i
did
go
mad
i
should
have
if
you
had
come
to
help
me
for
a
day
and
night
i
did
not
move
from
the
corner
of
that
sofa
there
i
turned
her
words
over
till
there
was
no
sense
left
in
them
my
nails
cut
my
palms
her
clasped
hands
were
slightly
stretched
from
her
her
whole
attitude
betrayed
the
tension
at
which
she
was
speaking
oh
my
god
how
i
hated
him
hated
him
how
i
hate
him
still
if
i
live
to
be
an
old
old
woman
i
shall
never
forgive
him
for
in
time
i
might
have
learnt
to
bear
his
leaving
me
if
it
had
only
been
his
work
that
took
him
from
me
it
was
always
between
us
as
it
was
but
it
was
at
least
only
a
pale
brain
thing
not
living
flesh
and
blood
but
that
all
the
time
he
should
have
been
deceiving
me
taking
pains
to
do
it
that
i
can
not
forgive
at
first
i
implored
i
prayed
there
might
be
some
mistake
you
too
told
me
there
was
and
i
hoped
against
hope
till
i
saw
her
then
i
knew
it
was
true
plainly
as
if
it
had
been
written
on
that
wall
she
paused
for
breath
in
this
bitter
pleasure
of
laying
her
heart
bare
for
i
was
the
person
he
could
always
have
been
satisfied
with
i
see
it
now
he
liked
a
woman
to
be
fair
and
soft
and
gentle
not
dark
and
it
was
only
a
phase
a
fancy
that
brought
him
to
me
and
it
could
have
lasted
for
ever
but
all
i
asked
of
him
was
common
honesty
to
be
open
with
me
it
was
much
to
ask
was
it
not
more
than
we
expect
of
a
stranger
in
the
street
but
it
was
too
much
for
him
all
the
same
and
so
now
i
have
nothing
left
to
remind
me
that
i
ever
knew
him
that
night
when
i
had
seen
her
i
burned
everything
every
photograph
every
scrap
of
writing
i
had
ever
had
from
him
if
only
one
could
burn
memories
too
i
had
to
tear
my
heart
over
it
i
used
to
think
i
felt
it
bleeding
drop
by
drop
for
all
the
suffering
fell
on
me
who
had
done
nothing
he
went
free
are
you
sure
of
that
it
may
have
been
hard
for
him
too
harder
than
you
think
maurice
was
looking
out
of
the
window
and
did
not
turn
she
shook
her
head
the
person
who
cares
ca
scheme
and
contrive
he
did
care
he
never
really
cared
for
me
only
for
himself
at
heart
he
was
cold
and
selfish
no
i
paid
for
it
all
i
who
hate
and
shrink
from
pain
who
would
do
anything
to
avoid
it
i
want
to
go
through
life
knowing
only
what
is
bright
and
happy
and
time
and
again
i
am
crushed
and
flung
down
but
in
all
my
life
i
have
suffered
like
this
and
now
perhaps
you
understand
why
i
never
want
to
hear
his
name
again
and
why
i
shall
never
not
if
i
live
to
be
a
hundred
years
old
never
forgive
him
it
is
in
me
to
do
it
as
a
child
i
ground
my
heel
into
a
rose
if
it
pricked
me
there
was
a
silence
then
she
sighed
and
pushed
her
hair
back
from
forehead
i
do
know
why
i
should
say
all
this
to
you
she
said
contritely
but
often
just
with
you
i
seem
to
forget
what
i
am
saying
it
must
be
i
think
because
you
so
quiet
yourself
at
this
maurice
turned
and
came
over
to
her
no
it
for
another
reason
you
need
to
say
these
things
to
some
one
you
have
brooded
over
them
to
yourself
till
they
are
magnified
out
of
all
proportion
the
best
thing
in
the
world
for
you
to
say
them
aloud
he
drew
up
a
chair
and
sat
down
beside
her
listen
to
me
you
told
me
once
not
very
long
ago
that
i
was
your
friend
well
i
want
to
speak
to
you
as
that
friend
and
to
play
the
doctor
a
little
as
well
will
you
not
go
away
from
here
for
a
time
go
away
and
be
with
people
who
know
nothing
of
all
this
people
you
do
need
to
be
afraid
of
let
yourself
be
persuaded
you
have
such
a
healthy
nature
give
it
a
chance
she
looked
at
him
with
a
listless
forbearance
do
go
on
i
know
everything
you
are
going
to
that
always
the
way
with
you
calm
quiet
people
who
are
not
easily
moved
yourselves
you
still
but
faith
in
these
trite
remedies
for
you
never
known
the
ills
supposed
to
cure
never
mind
me
it
you
we
have
to
think
of
and
i
want
you
to
give
my
remedy
a
trial
but
she
did
not
answer
and
again
a
few
minutes
went
by
before
she
stretched
out
her
hand
to
him
forget
what
i
said
i
shall
never
speak
of
it
but
then
you
too
must
promise
not
to
make
me
go
out
alone
to
think
and
remember
in
all
the
dirt
and
ugliness
of
the
streets
and
maurice
promised
ix
the
unnatural
position
circumstances
had
forced
him
into
was
to
him
summed
up
in
the
fact
that
he
had
spoken
in
defence
of
the
man
he
despised
above
all
others
only
at
isolated
moments
was
he
content
with
the
part
he
played
it
was
wholly
unlike
what
he
had
intended
he
had
wished
to
be
friend
and
mentor
to
her
and
he
was
now
both
but
nevertheless
there
was
something
wrong
about
his
position
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
at
first
been
satisfied
with
too
low
a
place
in
her
esteem
ever
to
allow
of
him
taking
a
higher
one
he
was
conscious
that
in
her
liking
for
him
there
was
a
drop
of
contempt
and
he
tormented
himself
with
such
a
question
as
should
a
new
crisis
in
her
life
arise
would
she
now
that
she
knows
you
turn
to
you
and
in
moments
of
despondency
he
answered
no
he
felt
the
tolerance
that
lurked
in
her
regard
for
him
kindness
and
care
on
his
part
were
not
enough
none
of
his
friends
had
an
idea
of
what
was
going
on
no
one
he
knew
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
bruderstrasse
and
the
skating
at
an
end
he
was
free
to
spend
his
time
as
he
chose
when
another
brief
nip
of
frost
occurred
he
alleged
pressure
of
work
and
did
not
take
advantage
of
it
then
early
one
morning
dove
paid
him
a
visit
with
a
list
in
his
hand
since
the
night
of
the
skating
party
his
acquaintances
had
not
seen
much
of
dove
for
he
had
been
in
close
attendance
on
the
pretty
little
american
who
made
no
scruple
of
exacting
his
services
now
after
some
preamble
it
came
out
that
he
wished
to
include
maurice
in
a
list
of
mutual
friends
who
were
clubbing
to
give
a
ball
a
ball
dove
called
it
since
the
gentlemen
were
to
pay
for
the
tickets
and
to
invite
the
ladies
but
maurice
vexed
at
the
interruption
made
it
clear
that
he
had
neither
time
nor
inclination
for
an
affair
of
this
kind
he
did
not
care
a
rap
for
dancing
and
after
doing
his
best
to
persuade
him
and
talking
round
the
matter
for
half
an
hour
dove
said
he
did
not
of
course
wish
to
press
anyone
against
his
will
and
departed
to
disturb
other
people
maurice
had
also
to
stand
fire
from
madeleine
for
she
had
counted
on
his
inviting
her
she
was
first
incredulous
then
offended
at
his
refusal
and
she
his
strongest
argument
that
he
did
not
own
a
if
that
was
all
she
knew
a
shop
in
the
bruhl
where
such
things
could
be
hired
for
a
song
maurice
now
thought
the
matter
closed
not
many
days
later
however
dove
appeared
again
with
a
crestfallen
air
he
had
still
over
a
dozen
tickets
on
his
hands
and
at
the
low
price
fixed
unless
all
were
sold
the
expenses
of
the
evening
would
not
be
covered
in
order
to
get
rid
of
him
maurice
bought
a
ticket
on
the
condition
that
he
was
not
expected
to
use
it
and
also
suggested
some
fresh
people
dove
might
try
so
that
the
latter
went
off
with
renewed
courage
on
his
disagreeable
errand
maurice
mentioned
the
incident
to
louise
that
evening
as
he
mentioned
any
trifle
he
thought
might
interest
her
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
and
did
not
mean
to
stay
for
he
had
found
her
on
the
sofa
with
a
headache
so
far
she
had
listened
to
him
with
scant
attention
but
at
this
she
raised
her
eyebrows
then
you
do
care
for
dancing
she
could
hardly
believe
it
he
repeated
the
words
he
had
used
to
dove
she
smiled
faintly
looking
beyond
him
at
a
sombre
patch
of
sky
i
should
think
not
if
it
were
me
she
raised
her
hand
and
considered
her
fingers
if
it
were
you
yes
but
she
did
not
continue
it
had
been
almost
a
spring
day
that
no
doubt
accounted
for
her
headache
maurice
made
a
movement
to
rise
but
louise
turned
quickly
on
her
side
and
in
her
own
intense
way
said
listen
you
have
the
ticket
you
say
use
it
and
take
me
with
you
will
you
he
smiled
as
at
the
whim
of
a
child
but
she
was
in
earnest
will
you
no
of
course
not
he
tempered
his
answer
with
the
same
smile
but
she
was
not
pleased
he
saw
that
her
nostrils
tightened
and
then
dilated
as
they
had
a
way
of
doing
when
she
was
annoyed
for
some
time
after
she
did
not
speak
but
the
very
next
day
when
he
was
remonstrating
with
her
over
some
small
duty
which
she
had
no
inclination
to
perform
she
turned
on
him
with
an
unreasonable
irritation
you
only
want
me
to
do
disagreeable
things
anything
that
is
pleasant
you
set
yourself
against
it
took
him
a
minute
to
grasp
that
she
was
referring
to
what
he
had
said
the
evening
before
yes
but
then
i
did
think
you
were
in
earnest
am
i
in
the
habit
of
saying
things
i
do
mean
and
have
you
said
yourself
that
i
am
killing
myself
shut
up
in
here
that
i
must
go
out
and
mix
with
people
very
well
here
is
my
chance
he
kept
silence
he
did
not
know
whether
she
was
not
mainly
inspired
by
a
spirit
of
contradiction
and
he
was
afraid
of
inciting
her
by
resistance
to
say
something
she
would
be
unable
to
retract
i
think
you
given
the
matter
sufficient
thought
he
said
at
last
it
ca
be
decided
offhand
she
was
angry
even
more
with
herself
than
with
him
oh
i
know
what
you
mean
you
think
i
shall
be
looked
askance
at
as
if
it
mattered
what
people
say
all
my
life
i
have
cared
and
i
shall
not
begin
now
when
i
have
less
reason
than
ever
before
he
did
not
press
the
subject
he
hoped
she
would
change
her
mind
and
thus
render
further
discussion
unnecessary
but
this
was
not
the
case
she
clung
to
the
idea
and
was
deaf
to
reason
to
a
certain
extent
he
could
feel
for
her
but
he
was
too
troubled
by
the
thought
of
unpleasant
possibilities
not
to
endeavour
to
persuade
her
against
it
he
knew
as
she
did
not
how
unkindly
she
had
been
spoken
of
and
he
was
not
sure
whether
her
declared
bravado
was
strong
enough
to
sustain
her
but
the
more
he
reasoned
the
more
determined
she
was
to
have
her
own
way
and
she
took
his
efforts
in
very
bad
part
you
pretend
to
be
solicitous
about
me
she
said
one
afternoon
from
her
seat
by
the
fire
yet
when
a
chance
of
diversion
comes
you
begrudge
it
to
me
you
would
rather
i
mouldered
on
here
that
not
generous
of
you
it
is
only
you
i
am
thinking
of
in
all
this
ridiculous
affair
the
word
stung
her
ridiculous
how
dare
you
say
that
i
still
young
am
i
not
and
i
have
blood
in
my
veins
not
water
well
i
want
to
feel
it
for
months
now
i
have
been
walled
up
in
this
tomb
now
i
want
to
live
not
do
you
understand
to
go
out
alone
on
a
filthy
day
with
no
companion
but
my
own
thoughts
i
want
to
dance
to
forget
myself
with
light
and
music
it
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
anyone
but
you
would
think
so
it
is
not
life
you
mean
it
excitement
what
it
means
is
that
you
do
want
to
take
yes
that
what
it
is
but
i
can
get
some
one
else
i
will
send
for
eggis
he
will
have
no
objection
why
drag
in
that
cad
name
you
know
very
well
if
you
do
go
it
will
be
with
me
and
no
one
else
a
slight
estrangement
grew
up
between
them
maurice
was
hurt
she
had
shown
too
openly
the
small
value
she
set
on
his
opinion
in
addition
to
this
he
was
disagreeably
affected
by
her
craving
for
excitement
at
any
cost
to
his
mind
there
was
more
than
a
touch
of
impropriety
in
the
proceeding
it
was
just
as
if
a
mourner
of
a
few
months
standing
should
suddenly
discard
his
mourning
and
with
it
all
the
other
decencies
of
grief
she
had
not
been
entirely
wrong
in
accusing
him
of
unreadiness
to
accompany
her
when
he
pictured
to
himself
the
astonished
faces
of
his
friends
he
found
it
impossible
to
look
forward
to
the
event
with
composure
he
saw
now
that
it
would
have
been
better
to
make
no
secret
of
his
friendship
with
louise
so
harmless
was
it
that
every
one
he
knew
might
have
assisted
at
it
but
now
the
very
abruptness
of
its
disclosure
would
put
it
in
a
bad
light
through
dove
he
noised
it
abroad
that
he
would
probably
be
present
at
the
ball
after
all
but
he
shunned
madeleine
with
due
precaution
and
could
not
bring
himself
even
to
hint
who
his
companion
might
be
in
his
heart
he
still
thought
it
possible
that
louise
might
change
her
mind
at
the
last
moment
take
fright
in
the
end
at
what
she
might
have
to
face
but
the
night
came
and
this
had
not
happened
while
he
dressed
himself
in
the
hired
suit
which
was
too
large
here
too
small
there
he
laid
a
plan
of
action
for
the
evening
since
it
had
to
be
gone
through
with
it
must
be
carried
off
in
a
highhanded
way
he
would
do
what
he
could
to
make
her
presence
in
the
hall
seem
natural
he
would
be
attentive
without
devoting
himself
wholly
to
her
and
he
would
induce
her
to
leave
early
he
called
for
her
at
eight
the
landlady
said
that
fraulein
was
not
quite
ready
and
told
him
to
wait
in
the
passage
but
the
door
of
the
room
was
ajar
and
louise
herself
called
to
him
to
come
in
it
was
comparatively
dark
for
she
had
the
lamp
behind
the
screen
where
he
heard
her
moving
about
her
skirts
rustled
drawers
and
cupboards
were
pulled
noisily
open
then
she
came
out
with
the
lamp
in
her
hand
maurice
was
leaning
against
the
piano
he
raised
his
eyes
and
made
a
step
forward
to
take
the
lamp
from
her
but
after
one
swift
startled
glance
he
drew
back
colouring
furiously
for
a
moment
he
could
not
collect
himself
his
heart
seemed
to
have
leapt
into
his
throat
and
there
to
be
hammering
so
hard
that
he
had
no
voice
with
which
to
answer
her
greeting
owing
to
what
he
now
termed
his
idiotic
preoccupation
with
himself
he
had
overlooked
the
fact
that
she
too
would
be
in
evening
dress
another
thing
was
he
had
never
seen
louise
in
any
but
or
the
loose
now
he
called
himself
a
fool
and
absurd
this
was
how
she
was
obliged
to
be
convention
decreed
it
hence
it
was
perfectly
decorous
it
was
his
own
feelings
that
were
unnatural
overstrained
but
in
the
same
breath
a
small
voice
whispered
to
him
that
all
dresses
were
not
like
this
one
also
that
every
girl
was
not
of
a
beauty
which
thus
emphasised
made
the
common
things
of
life
seen
poor
and
stale
louise
wore
a
black
dress
which
glistened
over
all
its
surface
as
if
it
were
sown
with
sparks
it
wound
close
about
her
and
out
behind
her
on
the
floor
but
this
was
only
the
sheath
from
which
rose
the
whiteness
of
her
arms
and
shoulders
and
the
full
column
of
her
throat
on
which
the
black
head
looked
small
until
now
he
had
seen
her
bared
wrist
no
more
now
the
only
break
on
the
long
arm
was
a
band
of
black
velvet
which
as
it
were
insisted
on
the
purity
of
the
skin
and
served
in
place
of
a
sleeve
strange
thoughts
coursed
through
the
young
man
mind
his
first
impulse
had
been
to
avert
his
eyes
in
this
familiar
room
it
did
not
seem
fitting
to
see
her
dressed
so
differently
from
the
way
he
had
always
known
her
before
however
he
had
followed
this
sensation
to
an
end
he
made
himself
the
spontaneous
avowal
that
until
now
he
had
never
really
seen
her
he
had
known
and
treasured
her
face
her
face
alone
now
he
became
aware
that
to
the
beautiful
head
belonged
also
a
beautiful
body
that
in
short
every
bit
of
her
was
beautiful
and
desirable
and
this
feeling
in
its
turn
was
overcome
by
a
painful
reflection
others
besides
himself
would
make
a
similar
observation
she
was
about
to
show
herself
to
a
hundred
other
eyes
and
this
struck
him
as
such
an
unbearable
profanation
that
he
could
have
gone
down
on
his
knees
to
her
to
implore
her
to
stay
at
home
unconscious
of
his
embarrassment
louise
had
gone
to
the
and
there
with
the
lamp
held
first
above
her
head
then
placed
on
the
she
critically
examined
her
appearance
as
if
dissatisfied
she
held
a
velvet
bow
to
the
side
of
her
hair
and
considered
the
effect
she
took
a
powderpuff
and
patted
cheeks
and
neck
with
powder
next
she
picked
up
a
narrow
band
of
velvet
on
which
a
small
star
was
set
and
put
it
round
her
throat
but
the
clasp
would
not
meet
behind
and
having
tried
several
times
in
vain
to
fasten
it
she
gave
an
impatient
exclamation
i
ca
get
it
in
as
maurice
did
not
offer
to
help
her
she
went
out
of
the
room
with
the
thing
in
her
hand
during
the
few
seconds
she
was
absent
the
young
man
racked
his
brain
to
invent
telling
reasons
which
would
induce
her
not
to
go
but
when
she
returned
slightly
flushed
at
the
landlady
ready
flattery
she
was
still
so
engrossed
in
herself
and
so
unmindful
of
him
that
he
recognised
once
more
his
utter
powerlessness
he
only
half
existed
for
her
this
evening
her
manner
was
as
different
as
her
dress
she
gathered
her
skirts
high
under
her
cloak
displaying
her
feet
in
in
the
turmoil
of
his
mind
maurice
found
nothing
to
say
as
they
went
but
she
did
not
notice
his
silence
there
was
a
suppressed
excitement
in
her
very
walk
and
she
breathed
in
the
cold
crisp
air
with
open
lips
and
nostrils
like
a
wild
animal
oh
how
glad
i
am
i
came
i
might
still
have
been
sitting
in
that
dull
room
when
i
have
danced
for
years
and
when
i
love
it
so
i
ca
understand
you
caring
about
it
he
said
and
the
few
words
contained
all
his
bitterness
that
is
only
because
you
do
know
me
she
retorted
and
laughed
dancing
is
a
passion
with
me
i
have
in
my
blood
i
my
mother
was
a
dancer
he
echoed
her
words
in
a
helpless
way
and
a
set
of
new
images
ran
riot
in
his
brain
but
louise
only
smiled
and
said
no
more
they
were
late
in
arriving
dancing
had
already
begun
the
were
black
with
coats
and
mantles
in
the
narrow
passage
that
divided
the
rooms
two
englishmen
were
putting
on
their
gloves
as
maurice
changed
his
shoes
close
to
the
door
he
overheard
one
of
these
men
say
excitedly
by
jove
there
a
pair
of
shoulders
who
the
deuce
is
it
maurice
knew
the
speaker
by
sight
he
was
a
medical
student
named
herries
who
on
the
ice
had
been
conspicuous
for
his
skill
as
a
skater
he
had
a
small
dark
moustache
and
wore
a
bunch
of
violets
in
his
buttonhole
you
have
been
here
long
enough
old
man
or
you
would
need
to
ask
answered
his
companion
then
he
dropped
his
voice
and
made
a
somewhat
disparaging
remark
so
low
however
but
what
the
listener
was
forced
to
hear
it
too
both
laughed
a
little
but
though
maurice
rose
and
clattered
his
chair
herries
persisted
with
an
englishman
supreme
indifference
to
the
bystander
do
you
think
she
can
dance
ca
tell
looks
a
trifle
heavy
well
i
risk
it
come
on
let
get
some
one
to
introduce
us
the
blood
had
rushed
to
maurice
head
and
buzzed
there
another
second
and
he
would
have
stepped
out
and
confronted
the
speaker
but
the
incident
had
passed
like
a
flash
and
it
was
better
so
it
would
have
been
a
poor
service
to
her
to
begin
the
evening
with
an
unpleasantness
besides
was
this
not
what
he
had
been
bracing
himself
to
expect
he
looked
stealthily
over
at
louise
considering
the
proximity
of
the
rooms
it
was
probable
that
she
too
had
overheard
the
derogatory
words
but
when
she
had
put
on
her
gloves
she
took
his
arm
without
a
trace
of
discomfiture
they
entered
the
hall
at
the
close
of
a
polka
and
slipped
unnoticed
into
the
train
of
those
who
promenaded
but
they
had
not
gone
once
round
when
they
were
the
observed
of
all
eyes
although
he
looked
straight
in
front
of
him
maurice
could
see
the
astonished
eyebrows
and
open
mouths
that
greeted
their
advance
at
one
end
of
the
hall
was
an
immense
mirror
he
saw
that
louise
who
was
flushed
held
her
head
high
and
talked
to
him
without
a
pause
in
a
kind
of
bravado
she
made
him
take
her
round
a
second
time
and
after
the
third
which
was
a
solitary
progress
they
remained
standing
with
their
backs
to
the
mirror
eggis
at
once
came
up
with
herries
in
his
train
and
on
learning
that
she
had
no
programme
the
latter
ran
off
to
fetch
one
before
he
returned
a
third
man
had
joined
them
and
soon
she
was
the
centre
of
a
little
circle
herries
having
returned
with
the
programme
would
not
give
it
up
until
he
had
put
his
initials
opposite
several
dances
louise
only
smiled
a
rather
artificial
smile
that
had
been
on
her
lips
since
she
entered
the
hall
maurice
had
fallen
back
and
now
stood
unnoticed
behind
the
group
once
louise
turned
her
head
and
raised
her
eyebrows
interrogatively
but
a
feeling
that
was
mingled
pride
and
dismay
restrained
him
and
as
even
when
the
choosing
of
dances
was
over
he
did
not
come
forward
she
walked
down
the
hall
on
herries
arm
the
musicians
began
to
tune
dove
as
master
of
ceremonies
was
flying
about
with
his
hands
in
gloves
that
were
too
large
for
him
people
ranged
themselves
for
the
lancers
in
lines
and
squares
maurice
lost
sight
for
a
moment
of
the
couple
he
was
watching
as
soon
as
the
dance
began
however
he
saw
them
again
they
were
waltzing
to
the
francaise
at
the
lower
end
of
the
hall
he
was
driven
from
the
corner
in
which
he
had
taken
refuge
by
hearing
some
one
behind
him
say
in
an
angry
whisper
i
call
it
positively
horrid
of
her
to
come
it
was
susie
fay
who
spoke
through
some
oversight
she
had
not
been
asked
to
dance
moving
slowly
along
behind
the
couples
that
began
a
schottische
he
felt
a
tap
on
his
arm
and
looking
round
saw
miss
jensen
she
swept
aside
her
ample
skirts
and
invited
him
to
a
seat
beside
her
but
he
remained
standing
you
do
care
for
dancing
she
queried
and
when
he
had
replied
well
say
now
mr
guest
we
are
all
dying
to
know
however
have
you
gotten
louise
dufrayer
along
here
this
evening
it
the
queerest
thing
out
indeed
said
the
young
man
drily
well
maybe
queer
is
not
just
the
word
but
why
we
all
presumed
she
was
perfectly
inconsolable
thinking
only
of
another
world
that
so
and
then
you
work
a
miracle
and
out
she
pops
fit
as
can
be
i
persuaded
her
for
the
sake
of
variety
mumbled
maurice
little
fauvre
the
baritone
had
come
up
but
miss
jensen
did
not
heed
his
meek
reminder
that
this
was
their
dance
that
was
excessively
kind
of
you
said
the
big
woman
and
looked
at
maurice
with
shrewd
eyes
and
no
doubt
louise
is
most
grateful
she
seems
to
be
enjoying
herself
keep
quiet
fauvre
do
till
i
am
but
i
do
like
her
dress
it
a
lovely
goods
and
no
mistake
but
it
ai
suitable
for
a
little
hop
like
this
it
too
much
how
miss
dufrayer
dresses
is
none
of
my
business
well
maybe
now
fauvre
come
along
she
called
it
fover
i
reckon
you
think
you
waited
long
enough
maurice
left
to
himself
again
was
astonished
to
hear
voice
in
his
ear
she
had
made
her
way
to
him
alone
for
goodness
sake
pull
yourself
together
she
said
cuttingly
every
one
in
the
hall
can
see
what
the
matter
with
you
before
he
could
answer
she
was
claimed
by
her
partner
one
of
the
few
germans
scattered
through
this
gathering
is
zat
your
brozzer
maurice
heard
him
ask
as
they
moved
away
he
watched
them
dancing
together
and
found
it
a
ridiculous
sight
round
madeleine
tall
and
angular
the
short
stout
man
rotated
fiercely
from
time
to
time
they
stopped
to
allow
him
to
wipe
his
face
maurice
contemplated
escaping
from
the
hall
to
some
quiet
room
beyond
but
as
he
was
edging
forward
he
ran
into
dove
arms
and
that
was
the
end
of
it
dove
it
seemed
had
had
his
eye
on
him
the
originator
of
the
ball
confessed
that
he
was
not
having
a
particularly
good
time
he
had
everything
to
superintend
the
dances
the
musicians
the
arrangements
for
supper
besides
this
there
were
at
least
a
dozen
too
many
ladies
present
he
believed
some
of
the
men
had
simply
given
their
tickets
away
to
and
had
let
them
come
alone
so
far
dove
had
been
forced
to
sacrifice
himself
entirely
and
he
was
hot
and
impatient
besides
i
routed
half
a
dozen
men
out
of
the
billiardroom
more
than
once
he
complained
irrelevantly
wiping
the
moisture
from
his
brow
but
it
of
no
now
just
look
at
that
he
interrupted
himself
the
has
had
too
much
to
drink
already
and
handing
him
more
beer
another
glass
and
he
wo
be
able
to
play
at
i
say
you
not
dancing
my
dear
fellow
it
really
wo
do
you
must
help
me
with
some
of
these
women
taking
maurice
by
the
arm
he
steered
him
to
a
corner
of
the
hall
where
sat
two
little
provincial
english
sisters
looking
hopeless
and
forlorn
who
had
invited
them
it
was
impossible
to
say
but
no
one
wished
to
dance
with
them
they
were
dressed
exactly
alike
were
alike
in
face
too
as
like
as
two
nuts
thought
maurice
as
he
bowed
to
them
their
hair
was
of
a
nutty
brown
their
eyes
were
brown
and
they
wore
brown
dresses
he
led
them
out
to
dance
one
after
the
other
and
they
were
overwhelmingly
grateful
to
him
he
could
hardly
tell
them
apart
but
that
did
not
matter
for
when
he
took
one
back
to
her
seat
the
other
sat
waiting
for
her
turn
in
dancing
he
was
thrown
together
with
more
of
his
friends
and
he
was
not
slow
to
catch
the
looks
cynical
contemptuous
amused
that
were
directed
at
him
some
were
disposed
to
wink
and
to
call
him
a
sly
dog
others
found
food
for
malicious
gossip
in
the
way
louise
had
deserted
him
and
when
he
met
miss
martin
in
a
quadrille
she
snubbed
his
advances
with
a
definiteness
that
left
no
room
for
doubt
round
dances
succeeded
to
square
dances
the
musicians
playing
grew
more
mechanical
flowers
drooped
and
dresses
were
crushed
an
englishman
or
two
ran
about
complaining
of
the
ventilation
as
often
as
maurice
saw
louise
she
was
with
herries
at
first
she
had
at
least
made
a
feint
of
dancing
with
other
people
now
she
openly
showed
her
preference
always
this
dapper
little
man
with
the
violets
and
the
simpering
smile
they
were
the
two
best
dancers
in
the
hall
louise
in
particular
gave
herself
up
to
the
rhythm
of
the
music
with
an
abandon
not
often
to
be
seen
in
a
something
of
the
professional
about
it
said
maurice
to
himself
as
he
watched
her
and
in
his
own
estimation
this
was
the
hardest
thought
he
had
yet
had
of
her
at
supper
he
sat
between
the
two
little
sisters
whose
birdlike
chatter
acted
upon
him
as
a
reiterated
noise
acts
on
the
nerves
of
one
who
is
trying
to
sleep
he
could
hardly
bring
himself
to
answer
civilly
at
the
further
end
of
the
table
on
the
same
side
as
he
sat
louise
she
was
with
those
who
had
been
her
partners
during
the
evening
they
were
drinking
champagne
and
were
very
lively
maurice
could
not
see
her
face
but
her
loud
excited
laugh
jarred
on
his
ears
afterwards
the
same
round
was
to
begin
afresh
except
that
the
sisters
had
generously
introduced
him
to
a
friend
but
when
the
first
dance
was
over
maurice
abruptly
excused
himself
to
his
surprised
partner
and
made
his
way
out
of
the
hall
at
the
disordered
a
few
people
still
lingered
and
deserters
were
again
knocking
balls
about
the
green
cloth
of
the
maurice
went
past
them
and
up
a
flight
of
stairs
that
led
to
a
gallery
overlooking
the
hall
this
gallery
was
in
semidarkness
at
the
back
of
it
chairs
were
piled
one
on
top
of
the
other
but
the
two
front
rows
had
been
left
standing
from
the
last
concert
held
in
the
building
and
here
two
or
three
couples
were
sitting
out
the
dance
he
went
into
the
extreme
corner
where
it
was
darkest
at
last
he
was
alone
he
no
longer
needed
to
dance
with
girls
he
did
not
care
a
jot
for
or
to
keep
up
appearances
he
was
free
to
be
as
wretched
as
he
chose
and
he
availed
himself
unreservedly
of
the
chance
it
was
not
only
the
personal
slight
louise
had
put
upon
him
throughout
the
evening
making
use
of
him
as
it
were
to
the
very
door
and
then
throwing
him
off
but
that
she
could
be
attracted
by
a
mere
waxen
prettiness
and
clothes
for
the
first
time
distrust
of
her
was
added
to
his
hurt
amazement
he
had
not
been
in
his
for
more
than
a
very
few
minutes
when
the
door
he
had
entered
by
reopened
and
a
couple
came
down
the
steps
to
the
corner
where
he
was
sitting
oh
there
some
one
there
cried
louise
at
the
sight
of
the
dark
figure
maurice
is
it
you
what
are
you
doing
here
sssh
said
herries
warningly
afraid
lest
her
clear
voice
should
carry
too
far
yes
it
me
said
maurice
stiffly
and
rose
but
i
going
i
sha
disturb
you
disturb
she
said
and
laughed
a
little
nonsense
of
course
not
from
her
position
on
herries
arm
she
looked
down
at
him
uncertain
how
to
proceed
then
she
laughed
again
but
how
fortunate
that
i
found
you
the
next
is
our
dance
is
it
pretended
to
examine
her
programme
it
will
begin
in
a
minute
i
think
i
wait
here
the
next
may
be
but
not
the
next
again
remember
said
herries
before
he
allowed
her
to
withdraw
her
arm
louise
nodded
and
laughed
auf
wiedersehen
but
after
the
door
had
dosed
behind
herries
she
remained
standing
a
step
higher
than
maurice
tipping
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
when
she
descended
the
step
and
was
on
a
level
with
him
he
could
see
how
her
eyes
glittered
was
that
lie
necessary
for
me
what
the
matter
maurice
why
are
you
like
this
why
have
you
not
asked
me
to
dance
he
was
unpleasantly
worked
on
by
her
free
use
of
his
name
i
you
have
i
had
a
chance
was
it
for
you
to
make
the
chance
or
did
you
expect
me
to
come
to
you
mr
guest
will
you
do
me
the
honour
of
dancing
with
me
oh
please
do
be
cross
do
spoil
my
pleasure
for
this
one
night
at
least
but
she
laughed
again
as
she
spoke
as
though
she
did
not
fear
his
power
to
do
so
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
at
her
touch
he
seemed
to
feel
through
sleeve
and
glove
the
superabundance
of
vitality
that
was
throbbing
in
her
this
evening
she
was
unable
to
be
still
for
a
moment
in
the
delicate
pallor
of
her
face
her
eyes
burned
black
as
jet
are
you
really
enjoying
yourself
so
much
what
can
you
find
in
it
all
come
come
down
and
dance
listen
can
you
resist
that
music
quick
let
us
go
down
i
dance
badly
i
not
herries
but
i
can
suit
my
step
to
anyone
wo
you
dance
with
me
when
i
ask
you
she
had
been
leaning
forward
looking
over
the
balustrade
at
the
couples
arranging
themselves
below
now
she
turned
and
put
her
arm
through
his
they
went
down
the
stairs
into
the
hall
close
beside
the
door
at
which
they
entered
they
began
to
dance
in
all
these
months
maurice
had
scarcely
touched
her
hand
now
convention
required
that
he
should
take
her
in
his
arms
he
had
complete
control
over
her
could
draw
her
closer
or
put
her
further
away
as
he
chose
for
the
first
round
or
two
this
was
enough
to
occupy
him
entirely
the
proximity
of
the
lithe
body
the
nearness
of
the
dark
head
the
firm
warm
resistance
that
her
back
offered
to
his
hand
they
were
dancing
to
the
music
of
the
wiener
blut
most
melancholy
gay
of
waltzes
in
which
the
long
legato
upward
sweep
of
the
violins
says
as
plainly
as
in
words
that
all
is
vanity
but
with
the
passing
of
the
players
to
the
second
theme
the
melody
made
a
more
direct
appeal
there
was
a
passionate
unrest
in
it
which
disquieted
all
who
heard
it
the
dancers
with
flushed
cheeks
and
fixed
eyes
responded
instinctively
to
its
challenge
the
lapidary
swing
with
which
they
followed
the
rhythm
became
less
circumspect
and
a
desire
to
dance
till
they
could
dance
no
more
took
possession
of
those
who
were
fanatic
no
one
yielded
to
the
impulse
more
readily
than
louise
she
was
quite
carried
away
maurice
felt
the
change
in
her
an
uneasiness
seized
him
and
increased
with
every
turn
she
had
all
but
closed
her
eyes
her
hair
brushed
his
shoulder
she
answered
to
the
lightest
pressure
of
his
arm
even
her
face
looked
strange
to
him
its
expression
its
individuality
all
that
made
it
hers
was
as
if
wiped
out
involuntarily
he
straightened
himself
and
his
own
movements
grew
stiffer
in
his
effort
to
impart
to
her
some
of
his
own
restraint
but
it
was
useless
and
as
they
turned
and
turned
to
the
maddening
music
cold
spots
broke
out
on
his
forehead
in
this
manner
she
had
danced
with
all
her
previous
partners
and
would
dance
with
those
to
come
such
a
pang
of
jealousy
shot
through
him
at
the
thought
that
without
knowing
what
he
was
doing
he
pulled
her
sharply
to
him
and
she
yielded
to
the
tightened
embrace
as
a
matter
of
course
with
a
jerk
he
stopped
dancing
and
loosened
his
hold
of
her
she
stood
and
blinked
at
lights
and
people
she
had
been
far
away
in
a
world
of
melody
and
motion
and
could
not
come
back
to
herself
all
at
once
wonderingly
she
looked
at
maurice
for
the
music
was
going
on
and
no
one
else
had
left
off
dancing
and
with
the
same
of
comprehension
but
still
too
dazed
to
resist
she
followed
him
up
the
stairs
it
easy
to
see
you
do
care
for
dancing
she
said
when
they
were
back
in
the
corner
of
the
gallery
her
breath
came
unsteadily
and
again
she
touched
her
face
with
the
small
scented
handkerchief
no
not
dancing
like
that
he
answered
rudely
but
now
again
as
so
often
before
directly
it
was
put
into
words
his
feeling
seemed
strained
and
puritanic
louise
leaned
forward
in
her
seat
to
look
into
his
face
like
what
what
do
you
mean
oh
you
foolish
boy
what
is
the
matter
with
you
you
will
tell
me
next
i
ca
dance
you
dance
only
too
well
but
you
would
rather
i
was
a
wooden
doll
is
that
it
how
is
one
to
please
you
first
you
are
vexed
with
me
because
you
did
not
ask
me
to
dance
and
when
i
send
my
partner
away
on
your
account
you
finish
one
dance
with
me
but
exact
that
i
shall
sit
here
in
a
dark
corner
and
let
that
glorious
music
go
by
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
you
but
her
attention
had
already
wandered
to
the
dancers
below
look
at
them
oh
it
makes
me
envious
no
one
else
has
dreamt
of
stopping
yet
for
no
matter
how
tired
you
are
beforehand
when
you
dance
you
do
feel
it
and
as
long
as
the
music
goes
on
you
must
go
on
too
though
it
lasted
all
oh
how
often
i
have
longed
for
a
night
like
this
and
then
i
never
met
a
better
dancer
than
mr
herries
and
for
the
sake
of
his
dancing
you
can
forget
what
a
puppy
he
is
puppy
at
the
warmth
of
his
interruption
she
laughed
the
low
indolent
laugh
by
means
of
which
she
seemed
determined
on
this
night
to
keep
anything
from
touching
her
too
nearly
how
crude
you
men
are
because
he
is
handsome
and
dances
well
you
reason
that
he
must
necessarily
be
a
simpleton
handsome
yes
if
a
tailor
dummy
is
handsome
but
louise
only
laughed
again
like
one
over
whom
words
had
no
power
if
he
were
the
veriest
scarecrow
i
would
forgive
him
for
the
sake
of
his
dancing
she
leant
forward
letting
her
gloved
arms
lie
along
her
knees
and
above
the
line
of
her
bodice
he
saw
her
white
chest
rise
and
fall
at
a
slight
sound
behind
she
turned
and
looked
expectantly
at
the
door
no
not
yet
said
the
young
man
at
her
side
besides
even
if
it
were
this
is
my
dance
remember
you
said
so
yourself
you
are
rude
maurice
and
langweilig
she
averted
her
face
and
tapped
her
foot
but
the
content
that
lapped
her
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
take
anything
earnestly
amiss
and
even
that
others
should
show
displeasure
jarred
on
her
like
a
false
note
do
be
angry
it
will
all
be
different
again
let
me
have
just
this
one
night
of
pleasure
let
me
enjoy
myself
in
my
own
way
to
hear
you
talk
one
would
think
i
had
no
wish
but
to
spoil
your
pleasure
oh
i
did
mean
that
you
misunderstand
everything
what
i
say
or
think
has
surely
no
weight
with
you
she
gave
up
the
attempt
to
pacify
him
and
leaning
back
in
her
chair
stifled
a
yawn
then
with
an
exclamation
of
how
hot
it
is
up
here
she
peeled
off
her
gloves
with
her
freed
hands
she
tidied
her
hair
drawing
out
and
thrusting
in
again
the
silver
dagger
that
held
the
coil
together
then
she
let
her
bare
arms
fall
on
her
lap
where
they
lay
in
strong
outline
against
the
black
of
her
dress
one
was
almost
directly
under
maurice
eyes
even
by
the
poor
light
he
could
see
the
mark
left
on
the
inside
of
the
wrist
by
the
buttons
of
the
glove
it
was
a
generously
formed
arm
but
so
long
that
it
looked
slender
and
its
firm
white
roundness
was
flawless
from
wrist
to
shoulder
he
shut
his
eyes
but
he
could
see
it
through
his
eyelids
sitting
beside
her
like
this
in
the
semidarkness
morbidly
aware
of
the
perfume
of
her
hair
and
dress
he
suddenly
forgot
that
he
had
been
rude
and
she
indifferent
he
was
conscious
only
of
the
wish
to
drive
it
home
to
her
how
unhappy
she
was
making
him
louise
he
said
so
abruptly
that
she
started
i
going
to
ask
you
to
do
something
for
me
i
have
made
many
demands
have
i
since
you
first
called
me
your
friend
he
paused
and
fumbled
for
words
do
do
dance
any
more
do
dance
again
she
stooped
forward
to
look
at
him
not
dance
again
i
what
do
you
mean
what
i
say
let
us
go
home
home
now
when
it
only
half
over
you
do
know
what
you
are
saying
but
her
surprise
was
already
on
the
wane
oh
yes
i
do
i
not
going
to
let
you
dance
again
she
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
at
the
new
light
in
which
he
was
showing
himself
but
the
moment
after
she
ceased
to
laugh
for
with
an
audacity
he
had
not
believed
himself
capable
of
maurice
took
the
arm
that
was
lying
next
him
and
midway
between
wrist
and
elbow
put
his
lips
to
it
kissing
it
several
times
in
different
places
taken
unawares
louise
was
helpless
then
she
freed
herself
ungently
no
no
i
wo
have
it
oh
how
can
you
be
so
foolish
my
gloves
where
is
my
glove
pick
it
up
and
give
it
to
me
at
once
he
groped
on
the
dusty
floor
the
veins
in
his
forehead
hammered
she
had
moved
to
a
distance
and
now
stood
busy
with
the
gloves
she
would
not
look
at
him
in
the
uneasy
silence
that
ensued
herries
opened
the
door
a
moment
later
they
went
out
together
maurice
remained
standing
until
he
saw
them
appear
below
then
he
dropped
back
into
his
seat
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
he
did
not
regret
what
he
had
done
he
did
not
care
in
the
least
whether
he
had
made
her
angry
with
him
or
not
on
the
contrary
the
feeling
he
experienced
was
akin
to
relief
disapproval
and
mortification
jealousy
and
powerlessness
all
the
varying
emotions
of
the
evening
had
found
vent
and
alleviation
in
the
few
hastily
snatched
kisses
he
no
longer
felt
injured
by
her
treatment
of
him
that
hardly
seemed
to
concern
him
now
his
sensations
at
this
minute
resolved
themselves
into
the
words
she
is
mine
she
is
mine
which
went
round
and
round
in
his
brain
and
then
in
a
sudden
burst
of
clearness
he
understood
what
it
meant
for
him
to
say
this
it
meant
that
the
farce
of
friendship
at
which
he
had
played
was
at
an
end
it
meant
that
he
loved
her
not
as
hitherto
with
a
touch
of
elegiac
resignation
but
with
a
violence
that
made
him
afraid
if
seemed
incredible
to
him
now
that
he
had
spent
two
months
in
close
fellowship
with
her
it
was
ludicrous
inhuman
for
he
now
saw
that
his
ultimate
desire
had
been
neither
to
help
her
nor
to
restore
her
to
life
that
was
a
comedy
he
had
acted
for
the
benefit
of
the
traditions
in
his
blood
brutally
at
this
moment
he
acknowledged
that
he
had
only
wished
to
hear
her
voice
and
to
touch
her
hand
to
make
for
himself
so
indispensable
a
place
among
the
necessities
of
her
life
that
no
one
could
oust
him
from
mine
mine
instinct
alone
spoke
in
him
that
same
blunt
instinct
which
had
reared
its
head
the
first
time
he
saw
her
but
which
until
now
he
had
kept
under
like
a
medieval
ascetic
no
reason
came
to
his
aid
he
neither
looked
into
the
future
nor
did
he
consider
the
past
he
only
swore
to
himself
in
a
kind
of
stubborn
wrath
that
she
was
his
and
that
no
earthly
power
should
take
her
from
him
one
by
one
the
hours
wore
away
the
dancers
ranks
were
thinned
but
those
who
remained
gyrated
as
insensately
as
ever
there
was
an
air
of
greater
freedom
over
the
the
chaperons
who
earlier
in
the
evening
had
sat
patiently
on
the
red
velvet
sofas
had
vanished
with
their
charges
and
in
their
train
the
more
sedate
of
the
company
it
was
past
three
and
now
every
few
minutes
a
cloaked
couple
crossed
a
corner
of
the
hall
to
the
when
maurice
went
downstairs
he
could
not
find
louise
and
some
time
elapsed
before
she
and
herries
emerged
from
the
although
the
lines
beneath
her
eyes
were
like
rings
of
hammered
iron
she
danced
anew
went
on
to
the
very
end
with
a
few
other
infatuated
people
finally
the
tired
musicians
rose
stiffly
to
pack
their
instruments
and
with
a
sigh
of
exhaustion
she
received
on
her
shoulders
the
cloak
maurice
stood
holding
they
were
among
the
last
to
leave
the
hall
the
lights
went
out
behind
them
herries
walked
a
part
of
the
way
home
with
them
and
talked
much
and
idly
ineffable
in
his
thought
maurice
but
louise
urged
him
on
saying
wild
disconnected
things
as
if
as
long
as
words
were
spoken
it
did
not
matter
what
they
were
again
and
again
her
laugh
resounded
it
was
hoarse
and
did
not
ring
true
she
has
had
too
much
champagne
maurice
said
to
himself
as
he
walked
silent
at
her
side
in
the
rossplatz
herries
who
was
in
a
becoming
fur
cap
and
a
coat
with
a
collar
took
a
circumstantial
leave
of
her
he
raised
both
her
hands
to
his
lips
to
the
memory
of
those
divine
waltzes
our
waltzes
he
said
sentimentally
and
to
all
the
others
the
future
has
in
store
for
us
she
left
her
hands
in
his
and
smiled
at
him
till
then
said
herries
or
shall
you
forget
your
promise
it
is
you
who
will
forget
not
i
after
this
maurice
and
she
walked
on
alone
together
it
was
that
dreariest
of
all
the
hours
between
sunset
and
dawn
when
it
is
scarcely
night
any
longer
and
yet
not
nearly
day
the
crisp
frost
of
the
previous
evening
had
given
place
to
a
bleak
rawness
the
day
that
was
coming
would
crawl
in
lugubriously
unable
to
get
the
better
of
the
darkness
the
houses
about
them
were
wrapped
in
sleep
they
two
were
the
only
people
abroad
and
their
footsteps
echoed
in
the
damp
streets
but
for
once
louise
was
not
affected
by
the
gloom
of
her
surroundings
she
walked
swiftly
and
her
chief
aim
seemed
to
be
to
render
any
but
the
most
trival
words
impossible
now
however
her
strained
gaiety
had
the
aspect
of
a
fever
maurice
believed
that
for
the
most
part
she
did
not
know
what
she
was
saying
until
they
stood
in
front
of
the
she
kept
up
the
tension
but
when
the
young
man
had
fitted
the
key
in
the
lock
and
turned
it
she
looked
at
him
and
for
the
first
time
this
night
gave
him
her
full
attention
good
night
my
friend
she
was
leaning
against
the
woodwork
beneath
the
lace
scarf
her
eyes
were
bent
on
him
with
a
strange
expression
maurice
looked
down
into
them
and
for
a
second
or
two
held
them
with
his
own
in
one
of
those
looks
which
are
not
for
ordinary
use
between
a
man
and
a
woman
louise
shivered
under
it
and
gave
a
nervous
laugh
the
next
moment
she
made
a
slight
movement
towards
him
an
involuntary
movement
which
was
so
imperceptible
as
to
be
hardly
more
than
an
easing
of
her
position
against
the
doorway
and
yet
was
unmistakable
as
unmistakable
as
was
the
little
upward
motion
with
which
she
resigned
herself
at
the
outset
of
a
dance
for
an
instant
his
heart
stopped
beating
in
a
flash
he
knew
that
this
was
the
solution
there
was
only
one
ending
to
this
night
of
longing
and
excitement
and
that
was
to
take
her
in
his
arms
as
she
stood
to
hold
her
to
him
in
an
infinite
embrace
till
his
own
nerves
were
stilled
and
the
madness
had
gone
from
her
but
the
returning
beat
of
his
blood
brought
the
knowledge
that
a
morrow
must
surely
come
a
morrow
for
both
of
them
a
cold
grey
day
to
be
faced
and
borne
she
was
not
herself
in
the
bonds
of
her
unnatural
excitement
it
was
for
him
to
be
wise
he
took
her
limply
hanging
hand
and
looked
at
her
gravely
and
kindly
you
are
very
tired
at
his
voice
the
wild
light
died
out
of
her
eyes
she
seemed
to
shrink
into
herself
yes
very
tired
and
oh
so
cold
ca
you
get
a
cup
of
tea
something
to
warm
you
but
she
did
not
hear
him
she
was
already
on
the
stair
he
waited
till
her
steps
had
died
away
then
went
headlong
down
the
street
but
when
he
came
to
think
things
over
he
did
not
pride
himself
on
the
he
had
displayed
on
the
contrary
he
was
tormented
by
the
wish
to
know
what
she
would
have
said
or
done
had
he
yielded
to
his
impulse
and
for
the
remainder
of
the
night
his
brain
lost
itself
in
a
maze
of
hazardous
conjecture
only
when
day
broke
a
cheerless
february
day
was
he
satisfied
that
he
could
not
have
acted
differently
upstairs
in
her
room
louise
lay
face
downwards
on
her
bed
and
there
her
arms
thrown
wildly
out
over
the
pillows
all
the
froth
and
intoxication
of
the
evening
gone
from
her
there
lay
and
wished
she
were
dead
three
days
later
towards
four
in
the
afternoon
maurice
watched
the
train
that
carried
her
from
him
steam
out
of
the
dresdener
bahnhof
the
clearness
he
had
gained
as
to
his
own
motives
and
the
ruthless
probing
of
himself
it
induced
both
led
to
the
same
conclusion
louise
must
go
away
the
day
after
the
ball
too
he
had
found
her
in
a
state
of
collapse
which
was
unparalleled
even
in
the
ups
and
downs
of
the
past
weeks
anything
do
anything
you
like
with
me
i
wish
i
had
never
been
born
and
though
no
muscle
of
her
face
moved
large
slow
tears
ran
down
her
sallow
cheeks
unconsciously
twisting
and
bending
herries
card
which
was
lying
on
the
table
maurice
laid
his
plan
before
her
and
having
won
the
above
consent
he
did
not
let
the
grass
grow
under
his
feet
he
applied
to
miss
jensen
for
practical
aid
and
that
lady
was
tactful
enough
to
give
it
without
curiosity
she
knew
dresden
well
recommended
it
as
a
lively
place
and
wrote
forthwith
to
a
pension
there
engaging
rooms
for
a
lady
who
had
just
recovered
from
a
severe
illness
by
tacit
agreement
this
was
understood
to
cover
any
extravagance
or
imprudence
of
which
louise
might
make
herself
guilty
now
she
had
gone
and
with
her
the
central
interest
of
his
life
but
the
tired
gesture
with
which
he
took
off
his
hat
and
wiped
his
forehead
as
he
walked
home
was
expressive
of
the
relief
he
felt
that
he
was
not
going
to
see
her
again
for
some
time
he
let
a
fortnight
elapse
a
fortnight
of
colourless
days
unbroken
by
word
or
sign
from
her
then
one
night
he
spent
several
hours
writing
to
her
writing
a
carefully
worded
letter
in
which
he
put
forward
the
best
reasons
he
could
devise
for
her
remaining
away
altogether
to
this
he
received
no
answer
x
from
one
of
the
high
wooden
benches
at
the
back
of
the
amphitheatre
in
the
alberthalle
where
he
had
lain
at
full
length
listening
to
the
performance
of
a
berlin
pianist
krafft
rose
full
to
the
brim
of
impressions
and
eager
to
state
them
that
man
he
began
as
he
left
the
hall
between
maurice
and
avery
hill
is
a
successful
teacher
and
therewith
his
fate
as
an
artist
is
sealed
no
teacher
can
get
on
to
the
higher
rungs
of
the
ladder
and
no
inspired
musician
be
a
satisfactory
teacher
if
the
artist
is
obliged
to
share
his
art
his
pupils
should
they
be
intelligent
may
pick
up
something
of
his
skill
learn
the
trick
of
certain
things
but
the
moment
he
begins
to
set
up
dogmas
it
is
the
end
of
as
if
it
were
possible
for
one
person
to
prescribe
to
another
of
a
totally
different
temperament
how
he
ought
to
feel
in
certain
passages
or
be
affected
by
certain
harmonies
if
i
for
example
choose
to
play
the
later
beethoven
sonatas
as
i
would
the
brahms
concerto
in
b
flat
with
a
thoroughly
modern
irony
what
is
it
that
hinders
me
from
doing
it
and
from
satisfying
myself
and
kindred
souls
who
are
honest
enough
to
admit
their
feelings
tradition
nothing
in
the
world
but
tradition
tradition
in
the
shape
of
the
teacher
steps
in
and
says
anathema
to
this
we
are
not
accustomed
ergo
it
can
not
be
and
it
is
just
the
same
with
those
composers
who
are
also
pedagogues
they
know
none
better
that
there
are
no
hard
and
fast
rules
in
their
art
that
it
is
only
convention
or
the
morbid
car
of
some
medieval
monk
which
has
banished
say
consecutive
fifths
from
what
is
called
g
pure
writing
that
further
you
need
only
to
have
the
regulation
number
of
years
behind
you
to
fling
squeamishness
to
the
winds
in
other
words
you
learn
rules
to
unlearn
them
with
infinite
pains
but
the
pupil
in
his
innocence
demands
a
rigid
basis
to
go
on
it
is
a
human
weakness
this
the
craving
for
rules
and
his
teachers
pamper
him
instead
of
saying
develop
your
own
ear
rely
on
yourself
only
what
you
teach
yourself
is
worth
knowing
instead
of
this
they
build
up
walls
and
barriers
to
hedge
him
in
behind
which
for
their
benefit
he
must
go
through
the
antics
of
a
performing
dog
but
nemesis
overtakes
them
they
fall
a
victim
to
their
own
wiles
just
as
the
liar
finally
believes
his
own
lies
ultimately
they
find
their
chief
delight
in
the
adroitness
with
which
they
themselves
overcome
imaginary
obstacles
his
companions
were
silent
avery
hill
had
a
nine
hours
behind
her
and
was
tired
besides
she
made
a
point
of
never
replying
to
krafft
tirades
once
only
of
late
had
she
said
to
him
in
maurice
presence
you
would
reason
the
skin
off
one
bones
heinz
you
are
the
most
person
alive
krafft
had
been
much
annoyed
at
this
remark
and
had
asked
her
to
call
him
a
jew
and
be
done
with
it
but
afterwards
he
admitted
to
maurice
that
she
was
right
and
it
only
the
naive
natures
that
count
maurice
had
found
his
way
back
to
krafft
for
in
the
days
of
uncertainty
that
followed
the
posting
of
his
letter
he
needed
human
companionship
until
the
question
whether
louise
would
return
or
not
was
decided
he
could
settle
to
nothing
and
krafft
ramblings
took
him
out
of
himself
since
the
ball
his
other
friends
had
given
him
the
cold
shoulder
hence
it
did
not
matter
whether
or
no
they
approved
of
his
renewed
intimacy
with
krafft
he
said
they
but
it
was
madeleine
who
was
present
to
his
mind
and
krafft
was
an
easy
person
to
take
up
with
again
he
never
bore
a
grudge
and
met
maurice
readily
it
had
not
taken
the
latter
long
to
shape
his
actions
or
what
he
believed
to
be
the
best
but
his
thoughts
were
beyond
control
he
was
as
helpless
against
sudden
spells
of
depression
as
against
dreams
of
an
iridescent
brightness
he
could
no
more
avoid
dwelling
on
the
future
than
reliving
the
past
if
louise
did
not
return
these
memories
were
all
that
were
left
him
if
she
did
what
form
were
their
relations
to
each
other
going
to
assume
and
this
was
the
question
that
cost
him
most
anxious
thought
a
thing
that
affected
him
oddly
at
this
time
was
his
growing
inability
to
call
up
her
face
it
was
incredible
this
face
which
he
had
supposed
he
knew
so
well
that
he
could
have
drawn
it
blindfold
had
taken
to
eluding
him
and
the
more
impatient
he
became
the
poorer
was
his
success
the
disquieting
thing
however
was
that
though
he
could
not
materialise
her
face
what
invariably
rose
before
his
eyes
was
her
long
bare
arm
as
it
had
lain
on
the
black
stuff
of
her
dress
at
first
it
only
came
when
he
was
battling
to
secure
the
face
then
it
took
to
appearing
at
unexpected
moments
and
eventually
it
became
a
kind
of
nightmare
which
haunted
him
he
would
start
up
from
dreaming
of
it
his
hair
moist
with
perspiration
for
strangely
enough
he
was
always
on
the
point
of
doing
it
harm
either
his
teeth
were
meeting
in
it
or
he
had
drawn
the
blade
of
a
knife
down
the
middle
of
the
whiteness
and
the
blood
spurted
out
along
the
line
which
reddened
instantly
in
the
wake
of
the
knife
april
had
come
bringing
april
weather
it
was
fitfully
sunny
and
a
mild
and
generous
dampness
spurred
on
growth
shrubs
and
bushes
were
so
thickly
sprinkled
with
small
buds
that
at
a
distance
it
seemed
as
though
a
transparent
green
veil
had
been
flung
over
them
in
the
gewandhaus
according
to
custom
the
ninth
symphony
had
brought
the
concert
season
to
a
close
once
more
the
chorus
had
struggled
victoriously
with
the
ode
to
joy
and
early
one
morning
maurice
held
a
note
in
his
hand
in
which
louise
announced
that
she
had
come
home
the
night
before
she
had
been
away
for
almost
two
months
and
to
a
certain
extent
he
had
grown
inured
to
her
absence
at
the
sight
of
her
handwriting
he
had
the
sensation
of
being
violently
roused
from
sleep
now
he
shrank
from
the
moment
when
he
should
see
her
again
for
it
seemed
that
not
only
the
present
but
all
his
future
depended
on
it
late
in
the
evening
he
returned
from
the
visit
puzzled
and
depressed
seven
had
boomed
from
far
and
near
before
he
reached
the
bruderstrasse
but
nevertheless
he
had
been
kept
waiting
in
the
passage
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
he
was
in
such
an
apprehensive
frame
of
mind
that
he
took
the
delay
as
a
bad
omen
when
he
crossed
the
threshold
louise
came
towards
him
with
one
of
those
swift
movements
which
meant
that
she
was
in
good
spirits
and
confident
of
herself
she
held
out
her
hands
and
smiled
at
him
with
all
her
dark
mobile
face
saying
words
that
were
as
impulsive
as
her
gesture
maurice
was
always
vaguely
chilled
by
her
outbursts
of
they
seemed
to
him
strained
and
unreal
so
accustomed
had
he
grown
to
the
darker
less
adaptable
side
of
her
nature
you
have
come
back
he
said
with
her
hand
in
his
yes
i
here
for
the
present
at
least
the
last
words
caught
in
his
ear
and
buzzed
there
making
his
foreboding
a
certainty
on
the
spot
his
courage
failed
him
and
though
louise
continued
to
ring
all
the
changes
her
voice
was
capable
of
he
did
not
recover
his
spirits
it
was
not
merely
the
sense
of
strangeness
which
inevitably
attacked
him
after
he
had
not
seen
her
for
some
time
on
this
occasion
it
was
more
partly
it
might
be
due
to
the
fact
that
she
was
dressed
in
a
different
way
her
hair
was
done
high
on
her
head
and
she
wore
a
light
grey
dress
of
modish
cut
and
design
her
face
too
had
grown
fuller
the
hollows
in
her
cheeks
had
vanished
and
her
skin
had
that
peculiar
clear
pallor
that
was
characteristic
of
it
in
health
he
was
stupidly
silent
he
could
not
join
in
her
careless
vivacity
besides
throughout
the
visit
nothing
was
said
that
it
was
worth
his
coming
to
hear
but
when
she
wished
him
she
said
with
a
strange
smile
altogether
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
maurice
for
having
made
me
go
away
he
himself
no
longer
felt
any
satisfaction
at
what
he
had
done
as
soon
as
he
left
her
he
tried
to
comprehend
what
had
happened
the
change
in
her
was
too
marked
for
him
to
be
able
to
console
himself
that
he
had
imagined
it
not
only
had
she
seemingly
recovered
as
if
by
magic
from
the
lassitude
of
the
winter
he
could
even
have
forgiven
her
the
alteration
in
her
style
of
dress
although
this
too
helped
to
alienate
her
from
him
but
what
he
ended
by
recognising
with
a
jealous
throb
was
that
she
had
mentally
recovered
as
well
she
was
once
more
the
girl
he
had
first
known
with
a
gift
for
keeping
an
outsider
beyond
the
circle
of
her
thoughts
and
feelings
an
outsider
the
weeks
of
intimate
companionship
were
forgotten
seemed
never
to
have
been
she
had
no
further
need
of
him
that
was
the
clue
to
the
mystery
and
the
end
of
the
matter
and
so
it
continued
the
next
day
and
the
next
again
louise
deliberately
avoided
touching
on
anything
that
lay
below
the
surface
she
vouchsafed
no
explanation
of
the
words
that
had
disquieted
him
nor
was
the
letter
maurice
had
written
her
once
mentioned
between
them
but
though
she
seemed
resolved
not
to
confide
in
him
she
could
not
dispense
with
the
small
practical
services
he
was
able
to
render
her
they
were
even
more
necessary
to
her
than
before
for
if
one
thing
was
clear
it
was
that
she
no
longer
intended
to
cloister
herself
up
inside
her
four
walls
the
day
after
her
return
she
had
been
out
till
late
in
the
afternoon
and
had
come
home
with
her
hands
full
of
parcels
she
took
it
now
as
a
matter
of
course
that
maurice
should
accompany
her
and
did
not
or
would
not
notice
his
abstraction
after
the
lapse
of
a
very
short
time
however
the
young
man
began
to
feel
that
there
was
something
feverish
in
the
continual
high
level
of
her
mood
she
broke
down
once
or
twice
in
trying
to
sustain
it
and
was
more
of
her
eloquently
silent
self
again
one
evening
he
came
upon
her
in
the
dusk
when
she
was
sitting
with
her
chin
on
her
hand
looking
out
before
her
with
the
old
questioning
gaze
occasionally
he
thought
that
she
was
waiting
for
something
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
she
would
break
off
and
grow
and
more
than
once
the
unexpected
advent
of
the
postman
threw
her
into
a
state
of
excitement
which
she
could
not
conceal
she
was
waiting
for
a
letter
but
maurice
was
proud
and
asked
no
questions
he
took
pains
to
use
the
cool
friendly
tone
she
herself
adopted
not
a
week
had
dragged
out
however
since
her
return
before
he
was
suffering
in
a
new
way
in
the
oldest
cruellest
way
of
all
the
pension
at
which
she
had
stayed
in
dresden
had
been
frequented
by
leisured
foreigners
over
twenty
people
of
various
nationalities
had
sat
down
daily
at
the
among
so
large
a
number
it
would
have
been
easy
for
louise
to
hold
herself
aloof
but
as
far
as
maurice
could
gather
she
had
felt
no
inclination
to
do
this
from
the
first
she
seemed
to
have
been
the
nucleus
of
an
admiring
circle
chief
among
the
members
of
which
was
a
family
of
americans
a
brother
and
two
sisters
rich
southerners
possessed
of
a
vague
leaning
towards
art
and
music
the
names
of
these
people
recurred
persistently
in
her
talk
and
as
the
days
went
by
maurice
found
himself
listening
for
one
name
in
particular
with
an
irritation
he
could
not
master
raymond
van
houst
a
ridiculous
name
fit
only
for
a
backstairs
romance
but
as
often
as
she
spoke
of
dresden
it
was
on
her
lips
whether
in
the
galleries
or
at
the
opera
on
driving
excursions
or
on
foot
this
man
had
been
at
her
side
and
soon
the
mere
mention
of
him
was
enough
to
set
maurice
teeth
on
edge
one
afternoon
he
found
her
standing
before
an
extravagant
mass
of
flowers
which
were
heaped
up
on
the
table
there
were
white
and
purple
violets
a
great
bunch
of
lilies
of
the
valley
and
roses
of
different
colours
they
had
been
sent
to
her
from
dresden
she
said
but
beyond
this
she
offered
no
explanation
all
the
vases
in
the
room
were
collected
before
her
but
she
had
not
begun
to
fill
them
she
stood
with
her
hands
in
the
flowers
tumbling
them
about
enjoying
the
contact
of
their
moist
freshness
to
maurice
remark
that
she
seemed
to
take
a
pleasure
in
destroying
them
she
returned
a
casual
what
does
it
matter
and
taking
up
as
many
violets
as
she
could
hold
looked
defiantly
at
him
over
their
purple
leaves
through
all
she
said
and
did
ran
a
strong
undercurrent
of
excitement
but
before
maurice
left
her
manner
changed
she
came
over
to
him
and
said
without
looking
up
maurice
i
want
to
tell
you
something
yes
what
is
it
he
spoke
with
the
involuntary
coolness
this
mood
of
hers
called
out
in
him
and
she
was
quick
to
feel
it
she
returned
to
the
table
you
ask
so
prosaically
you
are
altogether
prosaic
and
it
is
not
a
thing
i
can
tell
you
you
would
need
to
sit
down
again
it
a
long
story
and
you
were
going
and
it
late
we
will
leave
it
till
that
will
be
time
enough
and
if
it
is
fine
we
can
go
out
somewhere
and
i
tell
you
as
we
go
it
was
a
brilliant
may
afternoon
great
white
clouds
were
piled
one
on
the
top
of
another
like
bales
of
wool
and
their
fantastic
bulging
roundnesses
made
the
intervening
patches
of
blue
seem
doubly
distant
the
wind
was
hardly
more
than
a
breath
which
curled
the
tips
of
thin
branches
and
fluttered
the
loose
ends
of
veils
and
laces
in
the
rosental
where
the
were
and
each
branch
bore
its
complement
of
delicately
curled
leaves
the
paths
were
so
crowded
that
there
could
be
no
question
of
a
connected
conversation
but
again
louise
was
not
in
a
hurry
to
begin
she
continued
meditative
even
when
they
had
reached
the
kaiserpark
and
were
sitting
with
their
cups
before
them
in
the
long
wooden
building
open
at
one
side
she
had
taken
off
her
hat
a
somewhat
showy
white
hat
trimmed
with
large
white
feathers
and
laid
it
on
the
table
one
dark
wing
of
hair
fell
lower
than
the
other
and
shaded
her
forehead
maurice
who
was
on
tenterhooks
subdued
his
impatience
as
long
as
he
could
finally
he
emptied
his
cup
at
a
draught
and
pushed
it
away
you
wanted
to
speak
to
me
you
said
his
manner
was
curt
from
sheer
nervousness
his
voice
startled
her
yes
i
have
something
to
tell
you
she
said
with
a
hesitation
he
did
not
know
in
her
but
i
must
go
back
a
if
you
remember
maurice
you
wrote
to
me
while
i
was
away
did
you
she
said
and
looked
not
at
him
but
at
her
hands
clasped
before
her
you
gave
me
a
number
of
excellent
reasons
why
it
would
be
better
for
me
not
to
come
back
here
i
did
answer
your
letter
at
the
time
because
what
should
you
say
maurice
if
i
told
you
now
that
i
intended
to
take
your
advice
you
are
going
away
the
words
jerked
out
gratingly
of
themselves
that
is
what
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
i
have
a
chance
of
doing
so
chance
how
chance
he
asked
sharply
that
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
if
you
will
give
me
time
drawing
a
letter
from
her
pocket
she
smoothed
the
creases
out
of
the
envelope
and
handed
it
to
him
while
he
read
it
she
looked
away
looked
over
the
enclosure
some
people
were
crossing
it
and
she
followed
them
with
her
eyes
though
she
had
often
seen
their
counterparts
before
a
man
in
a
heavy
ulster
notwithstanding
the
mildness
of
the
day
stalked
on
ahead
unconcerned
about
the
fate
of
his
family
which
dragged
a
woman
and
two
children
in
the
rear
like
savages
thought
louise
where
the
male
goes
first
to
scent
danger
but
the
crackling
of
paper
recalled
her
attention
maurice
was
folding
the
sheet
and
replacing
it
in
the
envelope
with
a
ludicrous
precision
his
face
had
taken
on
a
pinched
expression
and
he
handed
the
letter
back
to
her
without
a
word
she
looked
at
him
expecting
him
to
say
something
but
he
was
obdurate
this
was
what
i
was
waiting
all
these
days
to
tell
you
she
said
you
knew
it
was
coming
then
he
scarcely
recognised
his
own
voice
he
spoke
as
he
supposed
a
judge
might
speak
to
a
proven
criminal
louise
shrugged
her
shoulders
no
that
is
as
far
as
possible
to
know
such
a
thing
through
the
crude
glass
window
the
sun
cast
a
medley
of
lines
and
lights
on
her
hands
and
on
the
checkered
there
were
two
rough
benches
and
a
square
table
the
coffeecups
stood
on
a
metal
tray
the
lid
of
the
pot
was
odd
did
not
match
the
set
all
these
inanimate
things
which
a
moment
ago
maurice
had
seen
without
seeing
them
now
stood
out
before
his
eyes
as
if
each
of
them
had
acquired
an
independent
life
and
no
longer
fitted
into
its
background
let
us
go
home
he
said
and
rose
go
home
but
we
have
only
just
come
cried
louise
with
what
seemed
to
him
pretended
surprise
why
do
you
want
to
go
home
it
is
so
quiet
here
i
can
talk
to
you
for
i
need
your
advice
maurice
you
must
help
me
once
again
i
help
you
in
this
no
thank
you
all
i
can
do
it
seems
is
to
wish
you
joy
he
remained
standing
with
his
hand
on
the
back
of
the
bench
but
at
the
cold
amazement
of
her
eyes
he
took
his
seat
again
it
is
a
matter
for
yourself
only
you
can
decide
it
none
of
my
business
he
moved
the
empty
cups
about
on
the
cloth
but
why
are
you
angry
have
i
good
reason
to
be
to
see
you
you
accepting
an
impertinence
of
this
kind
so
quietly
for
it
is
an
impertinence
louise
that
a
man
you
hardly
know
should
write
to
you
in
this
cocksure
way
and
ask
you
to
marry
him
impertinent
and
absurd
you
have
a
way
of
finding
most
things
i
want
to
do
absurd
she
answered
in
this
case
though
you
mistaken
the
tone
of
the
letter
is
all
it
should
be
and
besides
i
know
van
houst
very
well
maurice
looked
at
her
with
a
sardonic
smile
seven
weeks
is
a
long
time
she
added
seven
weeks
and
for
a
lifetime
oh
one
can
get
to
know
a
man
inside
out
in
seven
weeks
she
said
with
wilful
flippancy
especially
if
from
the
first
he
shows
so
plainly
maurice
do
be
angry
you
have
always
been
kind
to
me
you
not
going
to
fail
me
now
that
i
really
need
help
i
have
no
one
else
as
you
very
well
know
she
smiled
at
him
and
held
out
her
hand
he
could
not
refuse
to
take
it
but
he
let
it
drop
again
immediately
let
me
tell
you
all
about
it
and
how
it
happened
and
then
you
will
understand
louise
went
on
in
a
persuasive
voice
he
had
once
believed
that
the
sound
of
this
voice
would
reconcile
him
to
any
fate
you
think
the
time
was
short
but
we
were
together
every
day
and
sometimes
all
day
long
i
knew
from
the
first
that
he
cared
for
me
he
made
no
secret
of
it
if
anything
it
is
a
proof
of
tactfulness
on
his
part
that
he
should
have
written
rather
than
have
spoken
to
me
himself
i
like
him
for
doing
it
for
giving
me
time
and
then
listen
maurice
what
i
should
gain
by
marrying
him
he
is
rich
really
rich
and
in
an
american
way
and
years
old
his
sisters
would
welcome
me
one
of
them
told
me
as
much
and
told
me
too
that
her
brother
had
never
cared
for
anyone
before
he
would
make
an
ideal
husband
she
added
with
a
sudden
recklessness
at
the
sight
of
maurice
unmoved
face
americanly
chivalrous
to
the
fingertips
and
with
just
enough
of
the
primitive
animal
in
him
to
ward
off
monotony
maurice
raised
his
hand
as
if
in
so
you
too
then
like
any
other
woman
would
marry
just
for
the
sake
of
marrying
he
asked
with
bitter
disbelief
and
just
especially
and
particularly
i
for
heaven
sake
let
us
get
out
of
here
without
listening
to
her
protest
he
went
to
find
the
waiter
louise
followed
him
out
of
the
enclosure
carrying
hat
and
gloves
in
her
hand
they
struck
into
narrow
going
back
to
avoid
the
people
but
it
was
impossible
to
escape
all
and
those
they
met
eyed
them
with
curiosity
the
clear
english
voices
rang
out
unconcerned
the
pale
girl
with
the
italian
eyes
was
visibly
striving
to
appease
her
companion
who
marched
ahead
angry
and
impassive
for
a
few
hundred
yards
neither
of
them
spoke
then
louise
began
anew
and
that
is
not
all
you
judge
harshly
and
unfairly
because
you
know
the
facts
i
am
almost
quite
alone
in
the
world
i
have
no
relatives
that
i
care
for
except
one
brother
i
lived
with
him
on
his
station
in
queensland
until
i
came
here
but
now
he
married
and
there
would
be
no
room
for
me
in
the
house
figuratively
speaking
if
i
go
back
now
i
must
share
his
home
with
his
wife
whom
i
knew
and
disliked
while
here
is
some
one
who
is
fond
of
me
and
is
rich
and
who
offers
me
not
only
a
home
of
my
own
but
what
is
far
more
to
me
an
entirely
new
life
in
a
new
world
excellent
reasons
but
in
reckoning
them
up
you
have
forgotten
what
seems
to
me
the
most
important
one
of
all
whether
or
no
you
care
for
him
for
this
this
in
his
trouble
he
could
not
find
a
suitable
epithet
but
louise
refused
to
be
touched
i
like
him
she
answered
and
looked
across
the
slope
of
meadow
they
were
passing
i
liked
him
yes
as
any
woman
would
like
a
man
who
treated
her
as
he
did
me
he
was
very
good
tome
and
not
in
the
least
but
care
she
interrupted
herself
if
by
care
you
mean
then
no
a
hundred
thousand
times
no
i
shall
never
care
for
anyone
in
that
way
again
and
you
know
it
i
had
enough
of
that
to
last
me
all
my
life
very
well
then
and
i
say
if
you
married
a
man
you
care
for
as
little
as
that
i
should
never
believe
in
a
woman
not
of
course
that
it
matters
to
you
what
i
believe
in
and
what
i
do
but
to
hear
you
you
louise
counting
up
the
profits
to
be
gained
from
it
like
like
oh
i
do
know
what
i
could
have
believed
it
of
you
you
are
a
very
uncomfortable
person
maurice
i
mean
to
be
and
more
than
uncomfortable
listen
to
me
you
talk
of
it
lightly
and
coolly
but
if
you
married
this
man
without
caring
for
him
more
than
you
say
you
do
just
for
the
sake
of
a
home
or
his
money
or
his
good
manners
or
the
primitive
animal
or
whatever
it
is
that
attracts
you
in
him
he
grew
bitter
again
in
spite
of
himself
if
you
did
this
you
would
be
stifling
all
that
is
good
and
generous
in
your
nature
for
you
may
say
what
you
like
the
man
is
little
more
than
a
stranger
to
you
what
can
you
know
of
his
real
character
and
what
can
he
know
of
you
he
knows
as
much
of
me
as
i
ever
intend
him
to
know
indeed
then
you
would
tell
him
for
instance
that
only
a
few
months
ago
you
were
eating
your
heart
out
for
some
one
else
louise
winced
as
though
the
words
had
struck
her
in
the
face
before
she
answered
she
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
path
and
pinned
on
with
deliberate
movements
the
big
white
hat
beneath
the
drooping
brim
and
nodding
feathers
of
which
her
eyes
were
as
black
as
coals
no
i
should
not
she
said
why
should
i
do
you
think
it
would
make
him
care
more
for
me
to
know
that
i
had
nearly
died
of
love
for
another
man
certainly
not
and
it
might
also
make
him
less
ready
to
marry
you
that
exactly
what
i
think
one
was
as
bitter
as
the
other
but
maurice
was
the
more
violent
of
the
two
and
so
you
would
begin
the
new
life
you
talk
of
with
lies
and
deceit
a
most
excellent
beginning
if
you
like
to
call
it
that
i
only
know
that
no
one
with
any
sense
thinks
of
dragging
up
certain
things
when
once
they
are
dead
and
buried
or
are
you
perhaps
simple
enough
to
believe
any
man
living
would
get
over
what
i
have
to
tell
him
and
care
for
me
afterwards
in
the
same
way
he
turned
with
words
on
his
tongue
but
the
expression
of
her
face
intimidated
him
he
had
only
to
look
at
her
to
know
that
if
he
spoke
of
himself
at
this
moment
she
would
laugh
him
to
scorn
but
the
beloved
face
acted
on
him
in
its
own
way
his
sense
of
injury
weakened
louise
he
said
in
an
altered
tone
whatever
you
say
to
the
contrary
in
a
matter
like
this
i
ca
advise
you
for
i
understand
and
never
but
of
one
thing
i
as
sure
as
i
am
that
the
sun
will
rise
and
that
is
that
you
wo
do
it
do
you
honestly
think
you
could
go
on
living
day
after
day
with
a
man
you
do
sincerely
care
for
of
whom
the
most
you
can
say
is
that
he
not
repugnant
to
you
you
little
know
what
it
would
mean
and
you
may
reason
as
you
will
i
answer
for
you
and
i
say
no
and
again
no
it
is
in
you
to
do
it
you
are
not
mean
and
petty
enough
you
hide
your
feelings
try
as
you
no
you
could
deceive
some
one
by
pretending
to
care
for
him
for
months
on
end
you
would
be
miserably
unhappy
and
then
then
i
know
what
would
happen
you
would
be
candid
candid
about
everything
when
it
was
too
late
there
was
no
mistaking
the
sincerity
of
his
words
but
louise
was
boundlessly
irritated
and
made
no
further
effort
to
check
her
resentment
you
have
an
utterly
false
and
ridiculous
idea
of
me
and
of
everything
belonging
to
me
i
have
spent
all
this
time
with
you
for
nothing
i
know
you
better
than
you
know
yourself
i
believe
in
you
louise
and
i
know
i
am
right
and
some
day
you
know
it
too
these
words
only
incensed
her
the
more
what
you
know
or
think
you
know
is
nothing
to
me
if
you
had
listened
to
me
patiently
as
i
asked
you
to
instead
of
losing
your
temper
and
taking
what
i
said
as
a
personal
affront
then
yes
then
i
should
have
told
you
something
else
besides
how
when
i
came
back
a
fortnight
ago
i
was
quite
resolved
to
marry
this
man
if
he
asked
me
marry
him
and
cut
myself
off
for
ever
from
my
old
life
and
its
hateful
and
why
not
i
still
young
i
still
have
a
right
to
pleasure
and
change
and
and
in
all
these
days
i
once
hesitate
not
till
the
letter
came
yesterday
and
then
not
till
night
it
was
like
me
for
when
once
i
have
made
up
my
mind
i
never
go
back
so
i
determined
to
ask
you
ask
you
to
help
me
to
decide
for
you
had
always
been
kind
to
but
this
is
what
i
get
for
doing
it
her
anger
flared
up
anew
you
have
treated
me
abominably
maurice
and
i
sha
forget
it
all
your
ridiculous
notions
about
right
and
wrong
do
matter
a
straw
what
does
matter
is
that
when
i
ask
for
help
you
should
behave
as
if
as
if
i
were
going
to
commit
a
crime
your
opinion
is
nothing
to
me
if
i
decide
to
marry
the
man
i
shall
do
it
no
matter
what
you
say
i
sure
you
will
and
if
i
do
let
me
tell
you
this
it
wo
be
because
of
anything
you
said
not
from
any
notions
of
honesty
or
generosity
as
you
would
like
to
make
yourself
believe
but
merely
because
i
have
the
energy
in
me
i
could
keep
it
up
i
want
to
be
quiet
to
have
an
easy
life
the
fact
that
some
one
else
had
to
suffer
too
would
matter
to
me
in
the
least
it
myself
i
think
of
first
and
foremost
and
as
long
as
i
live
it
will
always
be
myself
her
voice
belied
her
words
he
expected
each
moment
that
she
would
burst
out
crying
however
she
continued
to
walk
on
with
her
head
erect
and
she
did
not
take
back
one
of
the
unkind
things
she
had
said
they
parted
without
being
reconciled
maurice
stood
and
watched
her
mount
the
staircase
in
the
vain
hope
that
she
would
turn
before
reaching
the
top
he
did
not
see
how
the
fine
may
afternoon
declined
and
passed
into
evening
how
the
high
stacks
of
cloud
were
broken
up
at
sunset
and
shredded
into
small
flakes
and
strips
of
cloud
which
saturated
with
gold
vanished
in
their
turn
how
the
shadows
in
the
corners
turned
from
blue
to
black
nor
did
he
note
the
mists
that
rose
like
steam
from
the
ground
intensifying
the
acrid
smell
of
garlic
with
which
the
woods
abounded
screened
by
the
thicket
he
sat
on
his
accustomed
scat
and
gave
himself
up
to
being
miserable
for
some
time
he
was
conscious
only
of
how
deeply
he
had
been
wounded
just
as
one
suffers
from
the
bruise
after
the
blow
at
the
moment
he
had
been
stunned
into
a
kind
of
quiescence
now
his
nerves
throbbed
and
tingled
but
little
by
little
a
vivid
recollection
of
what
had
actually
occurred
returned
to
sting
him
and
certain
details
stood
out
fixed
and
unforgettable
yet
in
reliving
the
hours
just
past
he
felt
no
regret
at
the
fact
that
they
had
quarrelled
what
first
smote
him
was
an
unspeakable
amazement
at
louise
the
knowledge
that
for
weeks
on
end
she
had
been
contemplating
marriage
was
beyond
his
belief
hardly
recovered
from
the
throes
of
a
suffering
believed
incurable
and
while
he
was
still
going
about
her
with
gloved
hands
as
it
were
she
was
ready
to
throw
herself
into
the
arms
of
the
first
likely
man
she
met
he
could
not
help
himself
in
this
connection
every
little
trait
in
her
that
was
uncongenial
to
him
started
up
with
appalling
distinctness
hitherto
he
had
put
it
down
to
his
own
sensitiveness
he
was
but
for
the
most
part
he
had
forgiven
her
on
account
of
all
she
had
come
through
for
he
believed
that
this
grief
had
swept
destructively
through
her
nature
leaving
a
jagged
wound
which
only
time
could
heal
now
as
if
to
prove
to
him
what
a
fool
he
was
she
showed
him
that
he
had
been
mistaken
in
this
also
she
could
recover
her
equilibrium
while
he
still
hedged
her
round
with
solicitude
recover
herself
and
transfer
her
affection
to
another
person
good
god
was
it
so
easy
a
matter
of
so
little
moment
to
grow
fond
of
one
who
was
almost
a
stranger
to
her
for
in
spite
of
what
she
said
to
the
contrary
he
was
persuaded
that
she
had
a
stronger
feeling
for
this
man
than
she
had
been
willing
to
admit
this
riper
man
with
his
experienced
way
of
treating
women
was
then
his
own
idea
of
her
wholly
false
was
there
after
all
something
in
her
nature
that
he
could
not
would
not
understand
he
denied
it
fiercely
almost
before
he
had
formulated
the
question
no
matter
what
her
actions
were
or
what
words
she
said
deep
down
in
her
was
an
intense
will
for
good
a
spring
of
noble
impulse
it
was
only
that
she
had
never
had
a
proper
chance
but
he
denied
it
to
a
vision
of
her
face
the
haunting
eyes
which
at
first
sight
had
destroyed
his
peace
of
mind
the
dead
black
hair
against
the
skin
it
was
in
these
things
that
the
truth
lay
not
in
the
blind
promptings
of
her
inclination
for
the
first
time
the
idea
of
marriage
took
definite
shape
in
his
mind
for
all
he
knew
it
might
have
been
lying
dormant
there
all
along
but
he
would
doubtless
have
remained
unconscious
of
it
for
weeks
to
come
had
it
not
been
for
the
events
of
the
afternoon
now
however
louise
had
made
it
plain
that
his
feelings
for
her
were
of
an
exaggerated
delicacy
plain
that
she
herself
had
no
such
scruples
he
need
hesitate
no
longer
but
marry
marriage
he
marry
louise
at
the
thought
of
it
he
laughed
that
he
maurice
guest
should
for
an
instant
put
himself
on
a
par
with
her
american
suitor
the
latter
rich
leisured
able
to
satisfy
her
caprices
surround
her
with
luxury
himself
younger
than
she
by
several
years
without
prospects
with
nothing
to
offer
her
but
a
limitless
devotion
he
tried
to
imagine
himself
saying
louise
will
you
marry
me
and
the
words
stuck
in
his
throat
for
he
saw
the
amused
astonishment
of
her
eyes
and
not
merely
at
the
presumption
he
would
be
guilty
of
what
was
as
clear
to
him
as
day
was
that
she
did
not
really
care
for
him
not
as
he
cared
for
her
not
with
the
faintest
hint
of
a
warmer
feeling
if
he
had
never
grasped
this
before
he
did
so
now
to
the
full
sitting
there
he
affirmed
to
himself
that
she
did
not
even
like
him
she
was
grateful
to
him
of
course
for
his
help
and
friendship
but
that
was
all
beyond
this
he
would
not
have
been
surprised
to
learn
from
her
own
lips
that
she
actually
disliked
him
for
there
was
something
irreconcilable
about
their
two
natures
and
never
for
a
moment
had
she
considered
him
in
the
light
of
an
eligible
lover
oh
how
that
stung
here
was
she
with
an
attraction
for
him
which
nothing
could
weaken
and
in
him
was
not
the
smallest
lineament
of
body
or
of
mind
to
wake
a
response
in
her
he
was
powerless
to
increase
her
happiness
by
a
hair
breadth
her
nerves
would
never
answer
to
the
inflection
of
his
voice
or
the
touch
of
his
hand
how
could
such
things
be
what
anomaly
was
here
her
face
rose
before
him
unsought
the
sweet
dark
face
with
the
expression
of
slight
melancholy
that
it
wore
in
repose
as
he
loved
it
best
it
was
with
him
when
stiff
and
tired
he
emerged
from
his
seclusion
and
walked
home
through
the
trails
of
mist
that
hung
on
the
it
was
with
him
under
the
and
to
its
accompanying
presence
the
strong
conviction
grew
in
him
that
evasion
on
his
part
was
no
longer
possible
sooner
or
later
come
what
might
the
words
he
had
faltered
over
even
to
himself
would
have
to
be
spoken
xi
one
day
some
few
weeks
later
madeleine
sat
at
her
writingtable
biting
the
end
of
her
pen
a
sheet
of
lay
before
her
but
she
had
not
yet
written
a
word
she
frowned
to
herself
as
she
sat
hard
at
work
that
morning
she
had
heard
a
ring
at
the
and
a
minute
after
her
landlady
ushered
in
a
visitor
in
the
shape
of
miss
martin
madeleine
rose
from
the
piano
with
annoyance
and
having
seated
miss
martin
on
the
sofa
waited
impatiently
for
the
gist
of
her
visit
for
she
was
sure
that
the
lively
american
would
not
come
to
see
her
without
an
object
and
she
was
right
she
knew
to
a
nicety
when
the
important
moment
arrived
most
of
the
visit
was
preamble
miss
martin
talked
at
length
of
her
own
affairs
assuming
with
disarming
candour
that
they
interested
other
people
as
much
as
herself
she
went
into
particulars
about
her
increasing
dissatisfaction
with
schwarz
and
retailed
the
glowing
accounts
she
heard
on
all
sides
of
a
teacher
called
schrievers
he
was
not
on
the
staff
of
the
conservatorium
but
he
had
been
a
favourite
of
liszt
and
was
attracting
many
pupils
from
this
miss
martin
passed
to
more
general
topics
such
as
the
blow
dove
had
recently
received
over
the
head
of
his
attachment
to
pretty
susie
fay
why
sue
she
feels
perfectly
dreadful
about
it
she
understand
dove
thinking
they
were
anything
but
real
good
friends
most
every
one
here
knew
right
away
that
sue
had
her
own
boy
down
home
in
illinois
yes
indeed
madeleine
displayed
her
want
of
interest
in
dove
concerns
so
plainly
that
miss
martin
could
not
do
otherwise
than
cease
discussing
them
she
rose
to
end
her
call
as
however
she
stood
for
the
momentary
exchange
of
courtesies
that
preceded
the
she
said
in
an
way
miss
wade
i
presume
i
need
inquire
if
you
acquainted
with
the
latest
about
louise
dufrayer
i
say
i
guess
i
need
inquire
seeing
you
so
well
acquainted
with
mr
guest
i
presume
though
you
do
see
so
much
of
him
now
no
indeed
i
hear
he
thrown
over
all
his
friends
i
feel
real
disappointed
about
him
i
thought
he
was
a
most
agreeable
young
man
but
as
momma
says
you
never
can
tell
an
i
reckon
louise
is
most
to
blame
seems
like
she
simply
ca
exist
without
a
beau
but
i
wonder
she
do
feel
ashamed
to
show
herself
the
way
she
talked
of
why
the
stories
i
hear
about
her
they
always
together
she
gotten
her
a
heap
of
new
things
too
a
millionaire
asked
her
to
marry
him
when
she
was
in
dresden
but
he
was
good
enough
for
her
no
an
all
on
account
of
mr
yes
indeed
but
i
must
say
i
feel
kind
of
sorry
for
him
anyway
he
was
a
real
pleasant
young
man
maurice
guest
is
quite
able
to
look
after
himself
said
madeleine
drily
is
that
so
well
i
presume
you
ought
to
know
you
were
once
so
well
acquainted
with
him
if
i
may
say
miss
wade
we
all
thought
it
was
you
was
his
fancy
yes
indeed
oh
i
always
knew
he
liked
louise
but
this
was
the
chief
grudge
she
too
bore
him
that
he
had
been
so
little
open
with
her
his
seeming
frankness
had
been
merely
a
feint
he
had
gone
his
own
way
and
had
never
really
let
her
know
what
he
was
thinking
and
planning
she
now
recalled
the
fact
that
louise
had
only
once
been
mentioned
between
them
since
the
time
of
her
illness
over
six
months
ago
and
she
madeleine
had
foolishly
believed
his
reticence
to
be
the
result
of
a
growing
indifference
since
the
night
of
the
ball
they
had
shunned
each
other
by
tacit
consent
but
though
she
could
avoid
him
in
person
madeleine
could
not
close
her
cars
to
the
gossipy
tales
that
circulated
in
the
last
few
weeks
too
the
rumours
had
become
more
clamatory
these
two
misguided
creatures
had
obviously
no
regard
for
public
opinion
and
several
times
madeleine
had
been
obliged
to
go
out
of
her
own
way
to
escape
meeting
them
face
to
face
on
these
occasions
she
told
herself
that
she
had
done
with
maurice
guest
and
this
decision
was
the
more
easy
as
since
the
beginning
of
the
year
she
had
moved
almost
entirely
in
german
circles
but
now
the
distasteful
tattle
was
thrust
under
her
very
nose
it
seemed
to
put
things
in
a
different
light
to
hear
maurice
pitied
and
discussed
in
this
very
room
in
listening
to
her
visitor
she
had
felt
once
more
how
strong
her
right
of
possession
was
in
him
she
was
his
oldest
friend
in
leipzig
now
she
was
ready
to
blame
herself
for
having
let
her
umbrage
stand
in
the
way
of
them
continuing
friends
had
he
been
dropping
in
as
he
had
formerly
done
she
might
have
prevented
things
from
going
so
far
and
certainly
have
been
of
use
in
hindering
them
from
growing
worse
for
with
louise
one
was
never
sure
and
so
she
determined
to
write
to
him
without
delay
in
this
though
she
was
piqued
as
well
by
a
violent
curiosity
louise
said
to
have
given
up
a
good
match
for
his
sake
xxx
she
could
not
believe
it
it
was
incredible
that
she
could
care
for
him
as
he
cared
for
her
madeleine
knew
them
both
too
well
maurice
was
not
the
type
of
man
by
whom
louise
was
attracted
she
wrote
in
a
guarded
way
it
seems
absurd
that
old
friends
should
behave
as
we
are
doing
if
anything
that
happened
was
my
fault
forgive
it
and
show
me
you
bear
me
a
grudge
by
coming
to
see
me
afternoon
they
had
not
met
for
close
on
four
months
and
for
the
first
few
minutes
after
his
arrival
madeleine
was
confused
by
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
maurice
it
was
not
only
that
he
was
paler
and
thinner
than
of
old
his
boyish
manner
had
deserted
him
and
when
he
forgot
himself
his
eyes
had
a
strange
brooding
expression
almost
thought
madeleine
and
in
order
to
surmount
an
awkwardness
she
had
been
resolved
not
to
feel
she
talked
glibly
maurice
said
he
could
not
stay
long
and
wished
to
keep
his
hat
in
his
hand
but
before
he
knew
it
he
was
sitting
in
his
accustomed
place
on
the
sofa
as
they
stirred
their
tea
she
told
him
how
annoyed
she
had
felt
at
having
recently
had
a
performance
postponed
in
favour
of
avery
hill
and
how
the
latter
was
said
to
be
going
crazy
with
belief
in
her
own
genius
maurice
seemed
to
be
in
the
dark
about
what
was
happening
and
made
no
attempt
to
hide
his
ignorance
she
could
see
too
that
he
was
not
interested
in
these
things
he
played
with
a
tassel
of
the
sofa
and
did
not
notice
when
she
stopped
speaking
it
is
his
turn
now
she
said
to
herself
and
left
the
silence
that
followed
unbroken
before
it
had
lasted
long
however
he
looked
up
from
his
employment
of
twisting
the
tassel
as
far
round
as
it
would
go
and
then
letting
it
fly
back
i
say
madeleine
now
i
here
something
i
should
like
to
ask
you
i
hope
though
you
wo
think
it
impertinence
on
my
part
he
cleared
his
throat
once
or
twice
lately
i
heard
a
report
about
you
several
times
indeed
i
did
pay
any
attention
to
it
not
till
a
few
days
back
that
is
when
i
saw
it
or
thought
i
saw
it
confirmed
with
my
own
eyes
i
was
at
bonorand
on
monday
evening
i
was
behind
you
in
an
instant
madeleine
had
grasped
what
he
was
driving
at
well
and
what
of
that
pray
she
asked
do
you
think
i
should
have
been
there
if
i
had
been
ashamed
of
it
i
saw
whom
you
were
with
he
went
on
and
treated
the
tassel
so
roughly
that
it
came
away
in
his
hand
i
say
madeleine
it
ca
be
true
what
they
say
that
you
are
thinking
of
of
marrying
that
old
german
madeleine
coloured
but
continued
to
meet
his
eyes
and
why
not
she
asked
do
destroy
my
furniture
please
why
not
he
echoed
and
laid
the
tassel
on
the
table
well
if
you
can
ask
that
i
should
say
you
do
know
the
facts
of
the
case
if
i
had
a
sister
madeleine
i
should
care
to
see
her
going
about
with
that
man
he
an
old
do
you
know
he
has
had
two
wives
and
is
divorced
from
both
you
and
your
sister
do
you
think
a
man
is
going
to
come
to
nearly
fifty
without
knowing
something
of
life
that
he
been
happy
in
his
matrimonial
relations
is
his
misfortune
not
his
fault
then
it
true
why
not
she
asked
for
the
third
time
then
of
course
i
nothing
more
to
say
i
no
right
to
interfere
in
your
private
affairs
i
hoped
i
should
still
be
in
time
that
all
no
you
ca
go
yet
sit
still
she
said
peremptorily
i
too
have
something
to
but
will
you
first
tell
me
please
what
it
can
possibly
matter
to
you
whether
you
are
in
time
as
you
call
it
or
not
why
of
course
it
we
have
seen
much
of
each
other
lately
but
you
were
my
first
friend
here
and
i
do
forget
it
particularly
in
a
case
like
this
where
everything
is
against
the
idea
of
you
marrying
this
man
your
age
your
character
all
common
sense
those
are
only
words
maurice
with
regard
to
my
age
i
am
over
as
you
know
i
need
no
boy
of
eighteen
for
a
husband
then
i
am
plain
i
shall
never
attract
anyone
by
my
personal
appearance
nor
will
a
man
ever
be
led
to
do
foolish
things
for
my
sake
i
have
worked
hard
all
my
life
and
have
never
known
what
it
is
to
let
take
care
of
now
here
at
last
comes
a
man
of
an
age
not
wholly
unsuitable
to
mine
whatever
you
may
say
what
though
he
has
enjoyed
life
he
offers
me
not
only
a
certain
social
standing
but
material
comfort
for
the
rest
of
my
days
whereas
otherwise
i
may
slave
on
to
the
end
and
die
eventually
in
a
governesses
home
you
would
never
do
that
you
are
not
one
of
that
kind
but
do
you
think
for
a
moment
you
be
happy
in
such
a
position
of
dependence
that
my
own
affair
there
would
certainly
be
nothing
extraordinary
in
it
if
i
were
as
you
put
it
perhaps
not
but
if
it
were
even
some
one
of
your
own
race
but
these
foreigners
think
so
queerly
and
then
too
madeleine
you
laugh
i
daresay
but
i
always
thought
of
you
as
different
from
other
women
strong
and
independent
and
quite
sure
of
yourself
the
kind
of
girl
that
makes
others
seem
little
and
stupid
no
one
here
was
good
enough
for
you
madeleine
amazement
was
so
great
that
she
did
not
reply
immediately
then
she
laughed
you
have
far
too
high
an
opinion
of
me
do
you
really
think
i
like
standing
alone
that
i
do
it
by
preference
you
were
never
more
mistaken
if
you
do
it
has
always
been
a
case
of
necessity
with
me
no
one
ever
having
asked
me
to
try
the
other
way
i
suppose
like
you
they
thought
i
enjoyed
it
however
set
your
mind
at
rest
your
kind
intervention
has
not
come
too
late
there
is
still
nothing
definite
i
glad
to
hear
it
i
do
say
there
may
be
she
added
herr
lohse
and
i
are
excellent
friends
and
it
wo
occur
to
me
not
to
accept
the
and
other
amusements
he
is
able
to
give
but
it
is
also
possible
that
for
the
sake
of
ideals
i
may
die
a
solitary
old
maid
here
she
was
overcome
by
the
comical
side
of
the
matter
and
burst
out
laughing
what
a
ridiculous
boy
you
are
if
you
only
knew
how
you
have
turned
the
tables
on
me
i
sent
for
you
this
afternoon
to
give
you
a
sound
and
instead
of
that
here
you
sit
and
lecture
me
well
if
i
have
achieved
something
it
too
absurd
she
repeated
more
tartly
for
you
to
come
here
in
this
way
to
care
for
my
character
when
you
yourself
are
the
talk
of
the
place
his
face
changed
as
she
had
meant
it
to
do
he
choked
back
a
sharp
rejoinder
i
be
obliged
if
you
leave
my
affairs
out
of
the
question
i
daresay
you
would
but
that
just
what
i
do
intend
to
do
for
if
there
are
rumours
going
the
round
about
me
what
on
earth
is
one
to
say
of
you
i
need
go
into
details
you
know
quite
well
what
i
mean
let
me
tell
you
that
your
name
is
in
everybody
mouth
and
that
you
are
being
made
to
appear
not
only
contemptible
but
ridiculous
the
place
is
a
of
scandal
i
told
you
that
before
he
cried
angry
enough
now
these
musiker
think
it
outside
the
bounds
of
possibility
for
two
people
to
be
friends
but
his
tone
was
unsure
and
he
was
conscious
of
it
yes
when
one
of
the
two
is
louise
kindly
leave
miss
dufrayer
out
of
the
question
oh
maurice
do
miss
dufrayer
me
i
knew
louise
before
you
even
knew
that
she
but
answer
me
one
question
and
i
done
are
you
engaged
to
louise
most
certainly
not
well
then
you
ought
to
for
though
you
do
care
what
people
say
about
yourself
your
conscience
will
surely
prick
you
when
you
hear
that
you
destroying
the
last
shred
of
reputation
louise
had
i
should
be
sorry
to
repeat
to
you
what
is
being
said
of
her
but
after
he
had
gone
she
reproached
herself
for
having
put
such
a
question
to
him
at
the
pass
things
had
reached
it
was
surely
best
for
him
to
go
through
with
his
infatuation
and
get
over
it
whereas
she
in
a
spasm
of
conventionality
had
pointed
him
out
the
sure
road
to
perdition
for
the
worst
thing
that
could
happen
would
be
for
him
to
bind
himself
to
louise
in
any
fashion
as
if
her
reputation
mattered
the
more
rapidly
she
got
rid
of
what
remained
to
her
the
better
it
would
be
for
every
one
and
particularly
for
maurice
guest
had
maurice
been
in
doubt
as
to
madeleine
meaning
it
would
have
been
removed
within
a
few
minutes
of
his
leaving
the
house
as
he
turned
a
corner
of
the
gewandhaus
he
came
face
to
face
with
krafft
though
they
had
not
met
for
weeks
heinrich
passed
with
no
greeting
but
a
disagreeable
smile
maurice
was
not
across
the
road
however
when
krafft
came
running
back
and
taking
the
lappel
of
his
coat
allowed
his
wit
to
play
round
the
talent
maurice
displayed
for
wearing
dead
men
shoes
carmen
was
given
that
night
in
the
theatre
maurice
had
fetched
tickets
from
the
in
the
morning
an
ardent
liking
for
the
theatre
had
sprung
up
in
louise
of
late
and
they
were
there
sometimes
two
or
three
evenings
in
succession
besides
this
carmen
was
her
favourite
opera
which
she
never
missed
they
heard
it
from
the
gallery
leaning
back
in
his
corner
maurice
could
see
little
of
the
stage
but
the
bossy
waves
of
his
companion
head
were
sharply
outlined
for
him
against
the
opposite
tier
louise
was
engrossed
in
what
was
happening
on
the
stage
her
eyes
were
wide
open
immovable
he
had
never
known
anyone
surrender
himself
so
utterly
to
the
mimic
life
of
the
theatre
under
the
influence
of
music
or
acting
that
gripped
her
louise
lost
all
remembrance
of
her
surroundings
she
lived
blindly
into
this
unreal
world
without
the
least
attempt
at
criticism
afterwards
she
returned
to
herself
tired
and
dispirited
and
with
a
marked
distaste
for
the
dullness
of
real
life
here
since
the
first
lively
clash
of
the
orchestra
since
the
curtain
rose
on
gay
sevilla
she
had
been
as
far
away
from
him
as
if
she
were
on
another
planet
not
he
was
obliged
to
confess
to
himself
that
it
made
very
much
difference
though
he
was
now
her
constant
companion
though
his
love
for
her
was
stronger
than
it
had
ever
been
he
knew
less
of
her
than
he
had
known
six
months
ago
when
one
emotion
had
made
her
life
an
open
book
since
that
unhappy
afternoon
on
which
he
learnt
the
contents
of
the
letter
from
dresden
they
had
spent
a
part
of
nearly
every
day
in
each
other
company
louise
had
borne
him
no
malice
for
what
he
had
said
to
her
indeed
with
the
generous
forgetfulness
of
offence
which
was
one
of
the
most
astonishing
traits
in
her
character
she
met
him
the
day
after
as
though
nothing
had
passed
between
them
by
common
consent
they
never
referred
to
the
matter
again
maurice
did
not
know
to
this
day
whether
or
how
she
had
answered
the
letter
for
although
she
had
forgiven
him
she
was
not
quite
the
same
with
him
as
before
a
faint
change
had
come
over
their
relation
to
each
other
it
was
something
so
elusive
that
he
could
not
have
defined
it
yet
nevertheless
it
existed
and
he
was
often
acutely
conscious
of
it
it
was
not
that
she
kept
her
thoughts
to
herself
but
she
did
not
say
all
she
thought
that
was
it
and
this
shade
of
reserve
in
her
who
had
been
so
frank
ate
into
him
sorely
he
accepted
it
though
as
a
chastisement
for
he
had
been
in
a
very
contrite
frame
of
mind
on
awakening
to
the
knowledge
that
he
had
all
but
lost
her
and
so
the
days
had
slipped
away
an
outsider
had
first
to
open
his
eyes
to
the
fact
that
it
was
impossible
for
things
to
go
on
any
longer
as
they
were
doing
that
for
her
sake
he
must
make
an
end
and
quickly
and
yet
it
had
been
so
easy
to
drift
so
hard
to
do
otherwise
when
louise
accepted
all
he
did
for
her
as
a
matter
of
course
in
that
way
of
hers
which
took
no
account
of
details
he
felt
sorry
for
her
too
for
she
was
not
happy
there
was
a
gnawing
discontent
in
her
just
now
and
for
this
in
great
measure
he
held
himself
responsible
for
a
few
weeks
she
had
been
buoyed
up
by
the
hope
of
a
new
life
and
he
had
been
the
main
agent
in
destroying
this
hope
in
return
he
had
had
nothing
to
offer
her
nothing
but
a
rigid
living
up
to
certain
uncomfortable
ideals
which
brought
neither
change
nor
pleasure
with
them
and
despite
his
belief
in
the
innate
nobility
of
her
nature
he
could
not
but
recognise
that
ideals
were
for
her
something
colder
and
sterner
than
for
other
people
she
made
countless
demands
on
his
indulgence
and
he
learnt
to
see
only
too
clearly
what
a
dependent
creature
she
was
it
was
more
than
a
boon
it
was
a
necessity
to
her
to
have
some
one
at
her
side
who
would
care
for
her
comfort
and
he
could
not
picture
her
alone
for
no
one
had
less
talent
than
she
for
the
trifles
that
compose
life
her
thoughts
seemed
always
to
be
set
on
something
larger
vaguer
beyond
he
devoted
as
much
time
to
her
as
he
could
spare
from
his
work
and
strove
to
meet
her
in
all
she
asked
but
it
was
no
slight
matter
for
her
changes
of
mood
had
never
been
so
abrupt
as
they
were
now
he
did
not
know
how
to
treat
her
sometimes
she
was
cold
and
unapproachable
so
wrapped
up
in
herself
that
he
could
not
get
near
her
and
perhaps
only
an
hour
later
her
lips
would
curve
upwards
in
the
smile
which
made
her
look
absurdly
young
and
her
eyes
too
have
all
the
questioning
wonder
of
a
child
or
she
would
be
silent
with
him
not
unkindly
but
silent
as
a
sphinx
and
on
the
same
day
a
fit
of
loquacity
would
seize
her
when
she
was
unable
to
speak
quickly
enough
for
the
words
that
bubbled
to
her
lips
he
managed
to
please
her
seldomer
than
ever
but
however
she
behaved
he
never
faltered
the
right
to
be
beside
her
was
now
his
and
the
times
she
was
the
hardest
on
him
were
the
times
he
loved
her
best
as
spring
having
reached
and
passed
perfection
slipped
over
into
summer
she
was
invaded
by
a
restlessness
that
nothing
could
quell
it
got
into
her
hands
and
her
voice
into
all
her
movements
and
worked
upon
her
like
a
a
crying
need
so
intense
did
it
become
that
it
communicated
itself
to
him
also
he
too
began
to
feel
that
rest
and
stillness
were
impossible
for
them
both
and
to
be
avoided
at
any
cost
i
have
never
really
seen
spring
louise
said
to
him
one
day
in
excuse
of
some
irrational
impulse
that
had
driven
her
out
of
the
house
and
the
quick
picture
she
drew
of
how
in
her
native
land
the
brief
winter
passed
almost
without
transition
into
the
scathing
summer
her
suggestion
of
unchanging
leaves
brown
barrenness
and
and
dryness
of
grass
burnt
to
cinders
of
dust
drought
and
hot
sandy
winds
all
this
helped
him
to
understand
something
of
what
she
was
feeling
a
remembrance
of
this
parched
heat
was
in
her
veins
making
her
eager
not
to
miss
any
of
the
young
teeming
beauty
around
her
or
one
of
the
new
strange
scents
eager
to
let
the
magic
of
this
awakening
permeate
her
and
amaze
her
like
a
primeval
happening
but
though
he
thus
grasped
something
of
what
was
going
on
in
her
he
was
none
the
less
uneasy
under
it
just
as
her
feverish
unburdening
of
herself
after
hours
of
silence
so
now
her
attitude
towards
this
mere
change
of
nature
disquieted
him
she
it
let
herself
go
in
its
exuberance
and
as
usual
when
she
lost
hold
of
her
nerves
he
found
himself
retreating
into
his
shell
practising
for
two
often
how
often
he
could
not
count
the
words
that
had
to
be
said
had
risen
to
his
lips
but
they
had
never
crossed
them
in
spite
of
the
wanton
greenness
of
the
woods
which
should
have
been
the
very
frame
in
which
to
tell
a
woman
you
loved
her
but
not
one
drop
of
her
nervous
exaltation
was
meant
for
him
she
had
never
shown
by
the
least
sign
that
she
cared
a
jot
for
him
and
daily
he
became
more
convinced
that
he
was
chasing
a
shadow
that
he
was
nothing
to
her
but
the
staffage
in
the
picture
of
her
life
he
was
torn
by
doubts
and
mortally
afraid
of
the
one
little
word
that
would
put
an
end
to
them
he
recollected
one
occasion
when
he
had
nearly
succeeded
in
telling
her
and
when
but
for
a
trick
of
fate
he
would
have
done
so
they
were
on
their
way
home
from
the
nonne
where
the
delicate
undergrowth
of
the
high
old
trees
was
most
prodigal
and
where
louise
had
closed
her
eyes
and
drunk
in
the
rich
earthy
odours
they
had
paused
on
the
suspension
bridge
and
stood
she
with
one
ungloved
hand
on
the
railing
to
watch
the
moving
water
looking
at
her
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
just
on
this
afternoon
she
might
listen
to
what
he
had
to
say
with
a
merciful
attentiveness
she
was
quiet
and
her
face
was
gentle
he
gripped
the
rail
with
both
hands
but
before
he
could
open
his
lips
a
third
person
turned
from
the
on
to
the
bridge
making
it
tremble
with
his
steps
a
jaunty
cavalry
officer
with
a
trim
moustache
and
bright
dancing
eyes
he
walked
past
them
but
threw
a
searching
look
at
louise
and
a
little
further
along
the
bridge
stood
still
as
if
to
watch
something
that
was
floating
in
the
water
in
reality
to
look
covertly
back
at
her
she
had
taken
no
notice
of
him
as
he
passed
but
when
he
paused
she
raised
her
head
and
then
she
looked
at
him
with
a
preoccupied
air
it
was
true
but
none
the
less
steadily
and
for
several
seconds
on
end
the
words
died
on
lips
and
going
home
he
was
as
irresponsive
as
she
herself
i
love
you
louise
love
you
he
said
it
now
sitting
back
in
his
dark
corner
in
the
theatre
but
amid
the
buzz
and
hum
of
the
music
and
the
shouting
of
the
toreadors
he
might
have
called
the
words
aloud
and
still
she
would
not
have
heard
them
strangely
enough
however
at
this
moment
for
the
first
time
during
the
evening
she
turned
her
head
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
in
a
dark
exorbitant
gaze
her
own
face
hardened
the
maurice
opened
the
leather
case
and
gave
her
the
glass
their
fingers
met
and
hers
groped
for
a
moment
round
his
hand
he
withdrew
it
as
though
her
touch
had
burnt
him
louise
flashed
a
glance
at
him
and
laid
the
en
the
ledge
in
front
of
her
without
making
use
of
it
slowly
the
traitorous
blood
subsided
to
the
reverberating
music
which
held
all
ears
and
left
him
sitting
alone
with
his
fate
maurice
had
a
moment
of
preternatural
clearness
he
realised
that
only
one
course
was
open
to
him
and
that
was
to
go
away
bei
nacht
und
nebel
if
it
could
not
be
managed
otherwise
but
however
it
happened
he
must
go
more
wholly
for
her
sake
than
madeleine
had
dreamed
of
unless
he
wanted
to
be
led
into
some
preposterous
folly
that
would
embitter
the
rest
of
his
life
who
could
say
how
long
the
wall
he
had
built
up
round
her
of
the
knowledge
he
shared
with
her
of
pity
for
what
she
had
undergone
would
stand
against
the
onset
of
this
morbid
overmastering
desire
to
the
gay
feelingless
music
he
thought
out
his
departure
in
detail
sparing
himself
nothing
but
in
the
long
interval
after
the
second
act
when
they
were
downstairs
on
the
loggia
where
it
was
still
half
daylight
where
the
lights
of
cafes
and
were
only
beginning
here
and
there
to
dart
into
existence
where
every
man
they
met
seemed
to
notice
louise
with
a
start
of
attention
here
maurice
was
irrevocably
convinced
that
it
would
be
madness
to
resign
his
post
without
a
struggle
for
that
it
would
long
remain
empty
he
did
not
for
a
moment
delude
himself
they
hardly
exchanged
a
word
during
the
remainder
of
the
evening
his
mouth
was
dry
carmen
and
her
gaudy
fate
drove
past
him
like
the
phantasmagoria
of
a
sleepless
night
when
the
opera
was
over
and
they
stood
waiting
for
the
crowd
to
thin
he
scanned
his
companion
face
with
anxiety
to
discover
her
mood
with
her
hand
on
the
wire
ledge
louise
watched
the
slow
fall
of
the
iron
curtain
her
eyes
were
heavy
she
still
lived
in
what
she
had
seen
her
preoccupation
continued
as
they
crossed
the
square
her
movements
were
listless
maurice
thoughts
went
back
to
a
similar
night
a
year
ago
when
for
the
first
time
he
had
walked
at
her
side
it
had
been
just
such
a
warm
night
as
this
and
then
as
now
he
had
braced
himself
up
to
speak
at
that
time
he
had
known
her
but
slightly
perhaps
for
that
very
reason
he
had
been
bolder
in
taking
the
plunge
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
her
face
was
averted
he
could
only
see
the
side
of
her
cheek
and
the
line
of
her
chin
are
you
tired
louise
he
asked
and
in
the
protective
tenderness
of
his
tone
her
name
sounded
like
a
term
of
endearment
she
made
a
vague
gesture
which
might
signify
either
yes
or
no
it
was
too
hot
for
you
up
there
he
went
on
next
time
i
shall
take
you
a
scat
downstairs
as
i
always
wanted
to
as
she
still
did
not
respond
he
added
in
a
changed
voice
altogether
though
it
will
be
better
for
you
to
get
accustomed
to
going
alone
to
the
theatre
she
turned
at
this
with
an
indolent
curiosity
why
because
why
because
it
will
soon
be
necessary
i
going
away
he
had
made
a
beginning
now
clumsily
and
not
as
he
had
intended
but
it
was
made
and
he
would
stand
fast
you
are
going
away
she
said
each
word
distinctly
as
if
she
doubted
her
ears
yes
why
maurice
for
several
reasons
it
not
a
new
decision
i
been
thinking
about
it
for
some
time
indeed
then
why
choose
just
to
tell
me
you
had
plenty
of
other
chances
and
i
had
enjoyed
the
theatre
and
the
music
and
coming
out
into
the
air
i
sorry
but
i
put
it
off
too
long
as
it
is
i
ought
to
have
told
you
louise
you
must
see
that
things
ca
go
on
like
this
any
longer
his
voice
begged
her
for
once
to
look
at
the
matter
as
he
did
but
she
heard
only
the
imperative
must
she
repeated
i
do
see
not
at
all
for
your
sake
i
must
go
ah
that
makes
it
clearer
people
have
been
talking
have
they
well
let
them
talk
i
ca
hear
you
spoken
of
in
that
way
oh
you
very
good
but
if
we
ourselves
know
that
what
being
said
is
not
true
what
can
it
matter
i
refuse
to
be
the
cause
of
it
do
you
indeed
she
laughed
you
refuse
after
doing
all
you
can
to
make
yourself
indispensable
you
now
say
get
on
as
best
you
can
alone
i
had
enough
i
must
do
say
it
on
my
account
that
the
thought
of
yourself
is
not
at
the
bottom
of
it
for
i
would
believe
you
though
you
did
i
give
you
my
word
i
have
only
thought
of
you
i
meant
it
i
mean
it
for
the
best
she
quickened
her
steps
and
he
saw
that
she
was
nervously
worked
up
no
man
can
want
to
injure
the
woman
he
respects
as
i
respect
you
her
shoulders
rose
in
her
own
emotional
way
but
tell
me
one
thing
he
begged
as
she
walked
inexorable
before
him
say
it
will
matter
a
little
to
you
if
i
go
that
you
will
miss
me
if
ever
so
little
louise
miss
you
what
does
it
matter
whether
i
miss
you
or
not
it
seems
to
me
that
counts
least
of
all
you
at
any
rate
will
have
acted
properly
you
will
have
nothing
to
reproach
yourself
oh
i
would
be
a
man
for
anything
on
earth
you
are
all
all
alike
i
hate
you
and
despise
you
every
one
of
you
they
were
within
a
few
steps
of
the
house
she
pressed
on
and
without
looking
back
at
him
or
wishing
him
disappeared
in
the
doorway
xii
it
was
a
hot
evening
in
june
the
perfume
of
the
lilac
now
in
fullest
bloom
lay
over
squares
and
gardens
like
a
suspended
wave
the
sun
had
gone
down
in
a
cloudless
sky
an
hour
afterwards
the
pavements
were
still
warm
to
the
touch
and
the
walls
of
the
buildings
radiated
the
heat
they
had
absorbed
the
high
old
houses
in
the
inner
town
had
all
windows
set
open
and
the
occupants
leaned
out
on
their
with
continental
nonchalance
the
big
were
filled
to
the
last
scat
in
the
woods
the
midges
buzzed
round
people
heads
in
accompanying
clouds
and
streaks
of
treacherous
white
mist
trailed
like
fixed
smoke
over
the
maurice
and
louise
had
rowed
to
connewitz
but
so
late
in
the
evening
that
most
of
the
variously
shaped
boats
with
coloured
lanterns
at
their
bows
were
returning
when
they
started
louise
herself
had
proposed
it
when
he
went
to
her
that
afternoon
he
found
her
stretched
on
the
sofa
a
lay
on
the
table
for
she
had
taken
him
at
his
word
and
shown
him
that
she
could
do
without
him
but
she
had
no
fancy
for
the
theatre
it
was
too
hot
she
looked
very
slight
and
young
in
her
white
dress
but
was
moody
and
out
of
spirits
on
the
way
to
connewitz
they
spoke
no
more
than
was
necessary
coming
back
however
they
had
the
river
to
themselves
and
she
no
longer
needed
to
steer
he
placed
cushions
for
her
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
there
she
lay
with
her
hands
clasped
under
her
neck
watching
the
starry
strip
of
sky
which
followed
them
between
the
tops
of
the
trees
above
like
a
complement
of
the
river
below
the
solitude
was
unbroken
they
might
have
gone
down
in
the
murky
water
and
no
one
would
ever
know
how
it
had
happened
a
snag
caught
unawares
a
clumsy
movement
in
the
light
boat
half
a
minute
and
all
would
be
or
for
the
first
and
the
last
time
in
his
life
he
would
take
her
in
his
arms
hold
her
to
him
feel
her
cheek
on
his
he
would
kiss
her
with
kisses
that
were
at
once
an
initiation
and
a
farewell
then
covering
her
eyes
with
his
hands
he
would
gently
very
gently
tilt
the
boat
a
moment
hesitation
it
sought
to
right
itself
rocked
violently
and
overturned
and
beneath
it
locked
in
each
other
arms
they
found
a
common
grave
in
fancy
he
saw
it
all
meanwhile
he
rowed
on
with
long
leisurely
strokes
and
the
lapping
of
the
water
round
the
oars
was
the
only
sound
to
be
heard
at
home
on
the
lid
of
his
piano
lay
the
prospectuses
of
in
other
towns
they
were
still
arriving
in
answer
to
the
impulsive
letters
he
had
written
off
the
night
after
the
theatre
but
the
last
to
come
had
remained
he
was
well
aware
of
it
his
lingering
on
had
all
the
appearance
of
a
weak
reluctance
to
face
the
inevitable
for
he
could
never
make
mortal
understand
what
he
had
come
through
in
the
course
of
the
past
week
he
could
no
more
put
into
words
the
isolated
spasms
of
ecstasy
he
had
experienced
when
nothing
under
the
sun
seemed
impossible
than
he
could
describe
the
slough
of
misery
and
uncertainty
which
on
occasion
he
had
been
forced
to
wade
through
for
the
most
part
he
believed
that
the
words
of
contempt
louise
had
spoken
came
straight
from
her
heart
but
he
had
also
known
the
faint
stir
ring
of
a
new
hope
and
particularly
was
this
the
case
when
he
had
not
seen
louise
for
some
time
then
at
night
as
he
lay
staring
before
him
this
feeling
became
a
sudden
refulgence
which
lighted
him
through
all
the
dark
hours
only
to
be
remorselessly
extinguished
by
daylight
most
frequently
however
it
was
so
slender
a
hope
as
to
be
a
mere
distracting
flutter
at
his
heart
whence
it
sprang
he
could
not
tell
he
knew
louise
too
well
to
believe
for
a
moment
that
she
would
make
use
of
pique
to
hide
her
feelings
but
there
was
a
something
in
her
manner
which
was
strained
in
the
fact
that
she
who
had
never
cared
should
at
length
be
moved
by
words
of
his
in
a
certain
way
she
had
looked
at
him
once
or
twice
in
these
days
or
in
a
certain
way
she
had
avoided
looking
at
him
no
he
did
not
know
what
it
was
but
nevertheless
it
was
there
a
faint
inarticulate
existence
and
compared
with
it
the
tangible
facts
of
life
were
the
shadows
of
a
shadow
surely
she
had
fallen
asleep
he
said
her
name
aloud
to
try
her
louise
she
did
not
stir
and
the
word
floated
out
into
the
night
became
an
expression
of
the
night
itself
they
had
passed
the
weir
and
its
foaming
and
now
glided
under
the
bridges
that
spanned
the
narrower
windings
of
the
river
the
wooden
looked
awesome
enough
to
harbour
mysteries
another
sharp
turn
among
sedge
and
rushes
and
the
outlying
streets
of
the
town
were
on
their
right
the
were
in
darkness
when
they
drew
up
alongside
the
narrow
maurice
got
out
with
the
chain
in
his
hand
and
secured
the
boat
louise
did
not
follow
immediately
her
hair
had
come
down
and
she
was
stiff
from
the
cramped
position
in
which
she
had
been
lying
when
she
did
rise
to
her
feet
she
could
hardly
stand
he
put
out
his
hand
and
steadied
her
by
the
arm
a
heavy
dew
must
be
falling
your
sleeve
is
wet
she
made
a
movement
to
draw
her
arm
away
at
the
same
moment
she
tangled
her
foot
in
her
skirt
tripped
and
if
he
had
not
caught
her
would
have
fallen
forward
take
care
what
you
doing
do
you
want
to
drown
yourself
i
do
know
i
should
mind
i
think
she
answered
tonelessly
his
own
balance
had
been
endangered
directly
he
had
righted
himself
he
set
her
from
him
but
it
could
not
be
undone
he
had
had
her
in
his
arms
had
felt
all
her
weight
on
him
the
sensation
seemed
to
take
his
strength
away
after
the
long
black
silent
evening
her
body
was
doubly
warm
doubly
real
he
walked
her
back
along
the
deserted
streets
at
a
pace
she
could
not
keep
up
with
she
lagged
behind
she
was
very
pale
and
her
face
wore
an
expression
of
almost
physical
suffering
she
looked
resolutely
away
from
maurice
but
when
her
eyes
did
chance
to
rest
on
him
she
was
swept
by
such
a
sense
of
nervous
irritation
that
she
hated
the
sight
of
him
as
he
walked
before
her
upstairs
in
her
room
when
he
had
laid
the
cushions
on
the
sofa
when
the
lamp
was
lighted
and
set
on
the
table
when
he
still
stood
there
pale
and
wretched
and
undecided
louise
came
to
an
abrupt
decision
advancing
to
the
table
she
leaned
her
hands
on
it
and
bending
forward
raised
her
white
face
to
his
you
told
me
you
were
going
away
why
do
you
not
go
why
have
you
not
already
gone
she
asked
and
her
mouth
was
hard
i
am
waiting
expecting
to
hear
his
answer
was
so
hasty
that
it
was
all
but
simultaneous
louise
ca
you
forgive
me
for
what
i
said
the
other
night
i
have
nothing
to
forgive
she
replied
coldly
in
spite
of
herself
you
said
you
must
go
i
ca
keep
you
here
against
your
will
it
has
made
you
angry
with
me
i
have
made
you
unhappy
you
are
making
us
both
unhappy
she
said
in
a
low
voice
now
it
is
i
who
say
things
ca
go
on
like
this
i
know
it
he
drew
a
deep
breath
louise
if
only
you
could
care
a
little
there
was
silence
after
these
words
but
not
a
silence
of
conclusion
both
knew
now
that
more
must
follow
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
into
her
eyes
can
you
not
see
how
i
love
you
and
how
i
suffer
it
was
a
statement
rather
than
a
question
but
he
was
not
aware
of
this
he
was
only
amazed
that
after
all
he
should
be
able
to
speak
so
quietly
in
such
an
even
tone
of
voice
there
was
another
pause
of
suspense
his
words
seemed
like
balls
of
down
that
he
had
tossed
into
the
still
air
they
sank
lingeringly
without
haste
and
she
stood
and
let
them
descend
on
her
his
haggard
eyes
hung
on
her
face
and
as
he
watched
he
saw
a
change
come
over
it
the
enmity
that
had
been
in
it
a
few
seconds
back
died
out
the
lips
softened
and
relaxed
and
when
the
eyes
were
raised
to
his
again
they
were
kind
full
of
pity
i
sorry
poor
boy
poor
maurice
she
seemed
to
hesitate
then
with
one
of
her
frankest
gestures
held
out
her
hand
at
its
touch
soft
and
living
he
forgot
everything
plans
and
resolutions
hopes
and
despairs
happiness
and
unhappiness
no
longer
existed
for
him
he
knew
only
that
she
was
sorry
for
him
that
some
swift
change
in
her
had
made
her
sympathise
and
understand
he
looked
down
with
dim
eyes
at
the
sweet
pale
face
now
alight
with
compassion
then
with
disarming
abruptness
he
took
her
head
between
his
hands
and
kissed
her
repeatedly
whereever
his
lips
chanced
to
fall
on
the
warm
mouth
the
closed
eyes
temples
and
hair
he
was
gone
before
she
recovered
from
her
surprise
she
had
instinctively
stemmed
her
hands
against
his
shoulders
but
when
she
was
alone
she
stood
just
as
he
left
her
her
eyes
still
shut
letting
the
sensation
subside
of
rough
unexpected
kisses
she
had
been
taken
unawares
her
heart
was
beating
for
a
moment
or
two
she
remained
in
the
same
attitude
then
she
passed
her
hand
over
her
face
that
was
foolish
of
him
very
she
said
she
looked
down
at
herself
and
saw
her
hands
she
stretched
them
out
before
her
with
a
sudden
sense
of
emptiness
if
i
could
care
yes
if
i
could
only
care
at
two
that
morning
maurice
wrote
forgive
me
i
did
know
what
i
was
doing
for
i
love
you
louise
no
woman
has
ever
been
loved
as
you
are
i
know
it
is
folly
on
my
part
i
have
nothing
to
offer
you
but
be
my
wife
and
i
will
work
my
fingers
to
the
bone
for
you
he
went
out
into
the
summer
night
and
posted
the
letter
returning
to
his
room
he
threw
himself
on
the
sofa
and
fell
into
a
heavy
sleep
from
which
he
did
not
wake
till
the
morning
was
well
advanced
work
was
out
of
the
question
that
day
when
he
waited
as
if
for
a
sentence
of
death
he
paced
his
narrow
room
incessantly
afraid
to
go
out
for
fear
of
missing
her
reply
the
hours
dragged
themselves
by
as
it
is
their
special
province
to
do
in
crises
of
life
and
with
each
one
that
passed
he
grew
more
convinced
what
her
answer
to
his
letter
would
be
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
little
boy
she
employed
as
a
messenger
put
a
note
into
his
hands
come
to
me
this
evening
it
was
all
but
evening
now
he
went
just
as
he
was
on
the
heels
of
the
child
the
windows
of
her
room
were
open
she
sprang
up
to
meet
him
then
paused
he
looked
desperately
yet
stealthily
at
her
the
commiseration
of
the
previous
night
was
still
in
her
face
but
she
was
now
quite
sure
of
herself
she
drew
him
to
the
sofa
and
made
him
sit
down
beside
her
then
however
for
a
few
seconds
in
which
he
waited
with
hammering
pulses
she
did
not
speak
the
dull
fear
at
his
heart
became
a
certainty
and
unable
to
bear
the
suspense
any
longer
he
took
one
of
her
hands
and
laid
it
on
his
forehead
then
she
said
maurice
poor
foolish
maurice
it
is
not
possible
you
see
that
yourself
i
sure
yes
i
know
quite
well
it
is
presumption
oh
i
do
mean
that
but
there
are
so
many
reasons
and
you
too
maurice
look
at
me
and
tell
me
if
what
you
wrote
was
not
just
an
attempt
to
make
up
for
what
happened
last
night
and
as
he
did
not
reply
she
added
you
must
make
yourself
reproaches
i
too
was
to
blame
it
was
nothing
of
the
sort
i
been
trying
for
weeks
now
to
tell
you
i
love
you
have
loved
you
since
the
first
time
i
saw
you
he
let
go
of
her
hand
and
she
sat
forward
with
her
arms
along
her
knees
her
eyes
were
troubled
but
she
did
not
lose
her
calm
manner
of
speaking
i
sorry
maurice
very
sorry
you
believe
me
do
you
when
i
say
so
but
believe
me
too
it
not
so
serious
as
you
think
you
are
young
you
will
get
over
it
and
forget
if
not
soon
at
least
in
time
you
must
forget
me
and
some
day
you
will
meet
the
nice
good
woman
who
is
to
be
your
wife
and
when
that
happens
you
will
look
back
on
your
fancy
for
me
as
something
foolish
and
unreal
you
be
able
to
understand
it
then
and
you
will
be
grateful
to
me
for
not
having
taken
you
at
your
word
maurice
laughed
all
the
same
he
tried
to
take
his
dismissal
well
he
rose
wrung
her
hand
and
left
her
in
the
seclusion
of
his
own
room
he
went
through
the
blackest
hour
of
his
life
he
began
to
make
final
preparations
for
his
departure
his
choice
had
fallen
on
stuttgart
it
was
far
distant
from
leipzig
he
would
be
well
out
of
temptation
way
the
temptation
suddenly
to
return
he
wrote
a
letter
home
apprising
his
relatives
of
his
intention
by
the
time
they
received
the
letter
it
would
be
too
late
for
them
to
interfere
otherwise
he
took
no
one
into
his
confidence
he
would
greatly
have
liked
to
wait
until
the
present
term
was
over
another
month
and
the
summer
vacation
would
have
begun
and
he
would
have
been
able
to
leave
without
making
himself
conspicuous
but
every
day
it
grew
more
impossible
to
be
there
and
not
to
see
her
for
four
days
now
he
had
kept
away
fighting
down
his
unreasoning
desire
to
know
what
she
was
doing
he
intended
only
to
see
her
once
more
to
bid
her
the
afternoon
before
his
interview
with
schwarz
he
had
arranged
this
with
himself
for
the
morning
at
the
master
private
house
he
sat
at
his
destroying
papers
and
old
letters
there
was
a
heap
of
ashes
in
the
cold
stove
by
the
time
he
took
out
tied
up
in
a
separate
packet
the
few
odd
scraps
of
writing
he
had
received
from
louise
he
balanced
the
bundle
in
his
hand
hesitating
what
to
do
with
it
finally
he
untied
the
string
to
glance
through
the
letters
once
again
at
the
sight
of
the
bold
black
familiar
writing
in
which
each
word
two
or
three
to
a
line
seemed
to
have
a
life
of
its
own
at
the
pages
each
of
which
he
knew
by
heart
at
the
characteristic
almost
masculine
signature
and
the
faint
perfume
that
still
clung
to
the
paper
at
the
sight
of
these
things
all
that
he
had
been
thinking
and
planning
since
seeing
her
last
was
effaced
from
his
mind
as
often
before
where
she
was
concerned
a
wild
impulse
surging
up
in
him
took
entire
possession
of
him
and
hours
of
patient
and
laborious
reasoning
were
by
one
swift
stroke
blotted
out
he
rose
locked
the
letters
up
again
rested
his
arm
on
the
lid
of
the
piano
his
head
on
his
arm
the
more
he
toyed
with
his
inclination
to
go
to
her
the
more
absorbent
it
became
and
straightway
it
was
an
ungovernable
longing
it
came
over
him
with
a
dizzy
force
which
made
him
close
his
eyes
and
he
was
as
helpless
before
it
as
the
drunkard
before
his
craving
to
drink
standing
thus
he
saw
with
a
flash
of
insight
that
though
he
went
away
as
far
as
steam
could
carry
him
he
would
never
as
long
as
he
lived
be
safe
from
overthrows
of
this
kind
it
was
something
elemental
which
he
could
no
more
control
than
the
flow
of
his
blood
and
he
did
not
even
stay
to
excuse
himself
to
himself
he
went
headlong
to
her
with
burning
words
on
his
lips
my
poor
boy
she
said
when
he
ceased
to
speak
yes
i
know
what
it
is
that
sudden
rage
that
comes
over
one
to
rush
back
at
all
costs
no
matter
what
happens
i
so
sorry
for
you
maurice
it
is
making
me
unhappy
you
are
not
to
be
unhappy
it
shall
not
happen
again
i
promise
besides
i
shall
soon
be
gone
now
but
at
his
own
words
the
thought
of
his
coming
desolation
pierced
him
anew
give
me
just
one
straw
to
cling
to
tell
me
you
wo
forget
me
all
at
once
that
you
will
miss
me
and
think
of
me
if
ever
so
little
you
asked
me
that
the
other
night
was
what
i
said
then
not
answer
enough
and
besides
in
these
last
four
days
since
i
have
been
alone
i
learnt
just
how
much
i
shall
miss
you
maurice
it
my
punishment
i
suppose
for
growing
so
dependent
on
anyone
you
must
go
away
too
you
ca
stay
here
by
yourself
we
must
both
go
in
opposite
directions
and
begin
afresh
she
did
not
reply
at
once
i
should
know
where
to
go
she
said
after
a
time
will
nothing
else
do
maurice
is
there
no
other
way
oh
why
ca
we
go
on
being
friends
as
we
were
he
shook
his
head
i
struggled
against
it
so
long
you
do
know
i
never
really
been
your
friend
only
i
could
hurt
you
before
by
telling
you
and
it
has
worn
me
out
i
good
for
nothing
louise
think
just
once
more
ask
yourself
once
more
if
it
quite
impossible
before
you
send
me
into
the
outer
darkness
she
was
silent
i
do
ask
you
to
love
me
he
went
on
in
a
low
voice
i
come
down
from
that
in
these
wretched
days
i
would
be
content
with
less
much
less
i
only
ask
you
to
let
yourself
be
loved
as

you
could
say
you
liked
me

little
all
the
rest
would
come
i
confident
of
it
in
time
i
should
make
you
love

would
take
oh

care
of
you

other
wish

what
happiness

it
sounds
so
good
you
are
good
maurice
but
the
future
tell
me
have
thought
of
the
future
i
should
think
i
do
you
suppose
it
means
nothing
to
me
to
be
so
despicably
poor
as
i
am
to
have
absolutely
nothing
to
offer
you
she
took
his
hand
that
not
what
i
mean
and
you
know
it
come
let
us
talk
sensibly
this
afternoon
and
look
things
straight
in
the
you
want
to
marry
me
you
say
and
let
the
rest
come
that
is
very
very
good
of
you
and
i
shall
never
forget
but
what
does
it
mean
maurice
you
have
been
here
a
little
over
a
year
now
you
and
still
have
about
a
year
to
stay
when
that
over
you
will
go
back
to
england
you
will
settle
in
some
small
place
and
spend
your
life
or
the
best
part
of
your
life
there
oh
maurice
you
are
my
kind
friend
but
i
tell
you
frankly
i
could
face
life
in
an
english
provincial
town
i
not
brave
enough
for
that
he
gleaned
a
ray
of
hope
from
her
words
we
could
live
here
anywhere
you
liked
i
would
make
it
possible
i
swear
i
would
she
shook
her
head
and
went
on
with
the
same
reasonable
sweetness
and
then
there
another
thing
if
i
married
you
sooner
or
later
you
would
have
to
take
me
home
to
your
people
have
you
really
thought
of
that
and
how
you
would
feel
about
it
when
it
came
to
the
point
no
no
it
impossible
for
me
to
marry
you
but
that
that
american
you
would
have
married
him
that
was
different
she
said
and
her
voice
grew
thinner
it
the
knowing
that
tells
maurice
you
would
have
that
still
to
learn
you
do
realise
it
yet
but
afterwards
it
would
come
home
to
listen
you
have
always
been
kind
to
me
i
owe
you
such
a
debt
of
gratitude
that
i
going
to
be
frank
brutally
frank
with
you
told
you
often
that
i
shall
never
really
care
for
anyone
again
you
know
that
do
you
well
i
want
to
tell
you
too
i
want
you
to
understand
quite
quite
clearly
that
that
i
belonged
to
him
altogether
entirely
that
i
oh
you
know
what
i
mean
maurice
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
the
past
is
the
past
it
should
never
be
mentioned
between
us
it
does
matter
nothing
matters
now
you
say
that
every
one
says
that
beforehand
she
answered
and
not
only
her
words
but
also
her
way
of
saying
them
seemed
to
set
her
down
miles
away
from
him
on
a
lonely
pinnacle
of
experience
afterwards
you
would
think
differently
louise
if
you
really
cared
it
would
be
different
you
would
say
such
things
then
you
would
be
only
too
glad
not
to
say
them
in
her
heart
she
knew
that
he
was
right
and
did
not
contradict
him
the
busy
little
clock
on
the
ticked
away
a
few
seconds
with
a
jerk
maurice
rose
to
his
feet
louise
remained
sitting
and
he
looked
down
on
her
black
head
his
gaze
was
so
insistent
that
she
felt
it
and
raised
her
eyes
his
forlorn
face
moved
her
why
is
it
what
is
the
matter
with
me
that
i
must
upset
your
life
like
this
i
ca
bear
to
see
you
so
and
yet
i
have
done
anything
have
i
i
have
always
been
honest
with
you
i
never
made
myself
out
to
be
better
than
i
am
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
me
i
think
that
no
one
can
ever
be
satisfied
to
be
just
my
yet
with
you
i
thought
it
was
different
i
thought
things
could
go
on
as
they
were
maurice
is
it
possible
say
it
is
show
me
just
one
little
spark
of
good
in
myself
i
not
different
from
other
men
louise
i
deluded
myself
long
enough
god
knows
she
made
a
despondent
gesture
and
turned
away
well
then
if
either
of
us
should
go
i
the
one
you
have
your
work
i
do
nothing
i
have
no
ties
no
friends
i
never
even
seem
to
have
been
able
to
make
acquaintances
and
if
i
went
you
could
stay
quietly
on
in
time
you
would
forget
if
i
only
knew
where
to
go
i
am
so
alone
and
it
is
all
so
hard
i
shall
never
know
what
it
is
to
be
happy
myself
or
to
make
anyone
else
happy
never
and
she
burst
into
tears
it
was
his
turn
now
to
play
the
comforter
drawing
chair
up
before
her
he
took
her
hand
and
said
all
he
could
think
of
to
console
her
he
could
bear
anything
he
told
her
but
to
see
her
unhappy
all
would
yet
turn
out
to
be
for
the
best
and
on
one
point
she
was
to
set
her
mind
at
rest
her
going
away
would
not
benefit
him
in
the
least
he
would
never
consent
to
stay
on
alone
where
they
had
been
so
much
together
i
nothing
to
look
forward
to
nothing
she
sobbed
nothing
i
care
to
live
for
as
soon
as
she
was
quieter
he
left
her
for
an
hour
or
more
louise
lay
huddled
up
on
the
sofa
with
her
face
pressed
to
her
arm
when
she
sat
up
again
she
pushed
back
her
heavy
hair
and
clasping
her
hands
loosely
round
her
knees
stared
before
her
with
vacant
eyes
but
not
for
long
tired
though
she
was
and
though
her
head
ached
from
crying
there
was
still
a
deep
residue
of
excitement
in
her
the
level
beams
of
the
sun
were
pouring
blindly
into
the
room
the
air
was
dense
and
oppressive
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
moved
about
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
herself
she
would
have
liked
to
go
out
and
walk
but
the
dusty
jarring
light
of
the
summer
streets
frightened
her
she
thought
of
music
of
the
theatre
as
a
remedy
for
the
long
evening
that
yawned
before
her
then
dismissed
the
idea
from
her
mind
she
was
in
such
a
condition
of
restlessness
this
night
that
the
fact
of
being
forced
to
sit
still
between
two
other
human
beings
would
make
her
want
to
scream
the
sun
was
getting
low
the
foliage
of
the
trees
in
the
opposite
gardens
was
black
with
copper
edges
against
the
refulgence
of
the
sky
she
leaned
her
hands
on
the
sill
and
gazed
fixedly
at
the
stretch
of
red
and
gold
which
like
the
afterglow
of
a
fire
flamed
behind
the
trees
her
eyes
were
filled
with
it
she
did
not
think
or
feel
she
became
one
by
looking
with
the
sight
before
her
as
she
stood
there
nothing
of
her
existed
but
her
two
widely
opened
eyes
she
was
a
miracle
wrought
by
the
sunset
she
was
the
sunset
in
one
of
those
vacancies
of
mind
which
all
intense
gazers
know
how
long
she
had
remained
thus
she
could
not
have
told
when
a
strange
thing
happened
to
her
from
some
layer
of
her
brain
which
started
into
activity
because
the
rest
of
it
was
so
passive
a
small
still
thought
glided
in
and
took
possession
of
her
mind
at
first
it
was
so
faint
that
she
hardly
grasped
it
but
once
established
there
it
became
so
vivid
that
with
one
sweep
it
blotted
out
trees
and
sunset
so
real
that
it
seemed
always
to
have
been
present
to
her
without
conscious
effort
on
her
part
the
solution
to
her
difficulties
had
been
found
a
decision
had
been
arrived
at
but
not
by
her
it
was
the
work
of
some
force
outside
herself
she
turned
from
the
window
and
pressed
her
hands
to
her
blinded
eyes
good
god
it
was
so
simple
to
think
that
this
had
not
occurred
to
her
before
that
throughout
the
troubled
afternoon
the
idea
had
never
once
suggested
itself
there
was
no
need
of
loneliness
and
suffering
for
either
of
them
he
might
stay
they
both
might
stay
she
could
make
him
happy
and
ward
off
the
change
she
so
who
was
she
to
stick
at
it
but
she
remained
dazed
doubtful
as
it
were
of
this
peaceful
ending
her
hand
still
covered
her
eyes
then
with
one
of
the
swift
movements
by
which
it
was
her
custom
to
turn
thought
into
action
she
went
to
the
and
scrawled
a
few
big
words
maurice
i
have
found
a
way
come
back
evening
she
hesitated
only
over
the
last
two
words
and
before
writing
them
sat
with
her
chin
in
her
hand
and
deliberately
considered
then
she
addressed
the
envelope
and
stamped
it
it
would
be
soon
enough
if
he
got
it
through
the
post
the
following
morning
but
with
her
to
resolve
was
to
act
she
was
ill
at
ease
under
enforced
procrastination
and
had
often
to
fight
against
a
burning
impatience
when
circumstances
delayed
the
immediate
carrying
out
of
her
will
in
this
case
however
she
had
voluntarily
postponed
maurice
return
for
hours
when
he
might
have
been
with
her
in
less
than
one
for
in
her
mind
there
lurked
the
seductive
thought
of
a
long
summer
day
with
an
emotion
at
its
close
to
which
she
could
look
forward
in
the
meantime
she
was
puzzled
how
to
fill
up
the
evening
after
all
she
decided
to
go
to
the
theatre
where
she
arrived
in
time
to
hear
the
last
two
acts
of
aida
from
a
seat
in
the
parquet
close
to
the
orchestra
she
let
the
showy
music
play
round
her
afterwards
she
walked
home
through
the
night
went
to
bed
and
at
once
fell
asleep
next
morning
she
wakened
early
that
was
the
sole
token
of
disturbance
she
could
detect
in
herself
it
was
very
still
there
was
a
faint
twittering
of
birds
but
the
noises
of
the
street
had
not
yet
begun
she
lay
in
the
subdued
yellow
light
of
her
room
with
one
arm
across
her
eyes
fresh
from
sleep
she
understood
certain
things
as
never
before
she
saw
all
that
had
happened
of
late
her
slow
recovery
her
striving
and
seeking
her
growing
friendship
with
maurice
in
a
different
light
on
this
morning
too
she
was
able
to
answer
one
of
the
questions
that
had
puzzled
her
the
night
before
she
saw
that
the
relations
in
which
they
had
stood
to
each
other
during
the
bygone
months
would
have
been
impossible
had
she
really
cared
for
him
she
liked
him
yes
had
always
liked
him
and
in
addition
his
patience
and
kindness
had
made
her
deeply
grateful
to
him
but
that
was
all
neither
his
hands
nor
his
voice
nor
his
eyes
nor
anything
he
did
had
had
the
power
to
touch
her
so
to
touch
her
that
her
own
hands
and
eyes
would
have
met
his
that
the
old
familiar
craving
which
was
partly
fear
and
partly
attraction
would
have
made
her
callous
to
his
welfare
had
there
been
a
breath
of
this
things
would
have
come
to
a
climax
long
ago
hot
and
eager
as
she
was
she
could
not
have
lived
on
coolly
at
his
side
and
at
this
moment
she
found
it
difficult
to
make
up
her
mind
whether
she
admired
maurice
or
the
reverse
for
having
been
able
to
carry
his
part
through
and
yet
though
no
particle
of
personal
feeling
drew
her
to
him
she
too
had
suffered
in
her
own
way
during
these
weeks
of
morbid
tension
when
he
had
been
incapable
either
of
advancing
or
retreating
how
great
the
strain
had
been
she
recognised
only
in
the
instant
when
he
had
spanned
the
breach
in
clear
unmistakable
words
if
he
had
not
done
it
she
would
have
been
forced
to
for
she
could
never
find
herself
to
rights
for
long
in
half
circumstances
if
she
were
not
to
grow
bewildered
she
had
to
see
her
road
simple
and
straight
before
her
his
words
to
her
after
they
had
been
on
the
river
together
more
perhaps
his
bold
yet
timid
kisses
had
given
her
back
strength
and
assurance
she
was
no
longer
the
miserable
instrument
on
which
he
tried
his
changes
of
mood
she
was
again
the
giver
and
the
bestower
since
she
held
a
heart
and
a
heart
happiness
in
the
hollow
of
her
hand
what
people
would
think
and
say
was
a
matter
of
indifference
to
her
besides
they
practically
believed
the
worst
of
her
already
no
she
had
nothing
to
lose
and
it
might
be
much
to
gain
and
after
all
it
meant
so
little
the
first
time
perhaps
or
if
one
cared
too
much
but
in
this
case
where
she
had
herself
well
in
hand
and
where
there
was
no
chance
of
the
blind
desire
to
kill
self
arising
which
had
been
her
previous
undoing
where
the
chief
end
aimed
at
was
the
retention
of
a
friend
here
it
meant
nothing
at
all
the
thought
that
she
might
possibly
have
scruples
on
his
part
to
combat
crossed
her
mind
she
stretched
her
arm
straight
above
her
head
then
laid
it
across
her
eyes
again
she
would
like
him
none
the
less
for
these
scruples
did
they
exist
now
she
believed
that
at
heart
she
had
really
appreciated
his
reserve
his
holding
back
where
others
would
have
been
so
ready
to
pounce
in
for
the
first
time
she
considered
him
in
the
light
of
a
lover
and
she
saw
him
differently
as
if
the
mere
contemplation
of
such
a
change
brought
her
nearer
to
him
she
was
stirred
by
a
new
sensation
which
had
him
as
its
object
and
under
the
influence
of
this
feeling
she
told
herself
that
perhaps
just
in
this
gentler
kindlier
love
which
only
sought
her
welfare
true
happiness
lay
she
strained
to
read
the
future
there
would
be
storms
neither
of
joy
nor
of
pain
but
watchful
sympathy
and
the
fine
manly
tenderness
that
shields
and
protects
oh
what
if
after
all
her
passionate
craving
for
happiness
it
was
here
at
her
feet
having
come
to
her
as
good
things
often
do
unexpected
and
unsought
she
could
lie
still
no
longer
she
sprang
up
with
an
alacrity
that
had
been
wanting
in
her
movements
of
late
and
throughout
the
long
day
this
impression
which
was
half
a
hope
and
half
a
belief
was
present
to
her
mind
making
everything
she
did
seem
strangely
festive
she
almost
feared
the
moment
when
she
would
see
him
again
lest
anything
he
said
should
dissipate
her
hope
when
he
came
her
eyes
followed
him
searchingly
with
an
instinct
that
was
now
morbidly
sharpened
maurice
was
aware
of
the
change
in
her
even
before
he
saw
her
eyes
his
own
were
one
devouring
question
she
made
him
sit
down
beside
her
what
is
it
louise
tell
me
quickly
remember
i
been
all
day
in
suspense
he
said
as
seconds
passed
and
she
did
not
speak
you
got
my
note
then
what
is
it
what
did
you
mean
just
a
little
patience
maurice
you
take
one
breath
away
you
want
to
know
everything
at
once
i
sent
for
you
because
oh
because
i
want
you
to
let
us
go
on
being
friends
is
that
all
he
cried
and
his
face
fell
when
i
have
told
you
again
and
again
that
just
what
i
ca
do
she
smiled
i
wish
i
had
known
you
as
a
boy
maurice
oh
but
as
quite
a
young
boy
she
said
in
such
a
changed
voice
that
he
glanced
up
in
surprise
whether
it
was
the
look
she
bent
on
him
or
her
voice
or
her
words
he
did
not
know
but
something
emboldened
him
to
do
what
he
had
often
done
in
fancy
he
slid
to
his
knees
before
her
and
laid
his
head
on
her
lap
she
began
to
smooth
back
his
hair
and
each
time
her
hand
came
forward
she
let
it
rest
for
a
she
wondered
how
he
would
look
when
he
knew
you
ca
care
for
me
i
know
but
i
would
give
my
life
to
make
you
happy
why
do
you
love
me
she
experienced
a
new
pleasure
in
postponing
his
knowing
postponing
it
indefinitely
how
can
i
say
all
i
know
is
how
i
love
you
and
how
i
have
suffered
my
poor
maurice
she
said
in
the
same
caressing
way
yes
i
shall
always
call
you
for
the
love
i
could
give
you
would
be
worthless
compared
with
yours
to
me
it
would
be
if
you
only
knew
how
i
have
longed
for
you
and
how
i
have
struggled
he
took
enough
of
her
dress
to
bury
his
face
in
she
sat
back
and
looked
over
him
into
the
growing
dusk
of
the
room
and
in
the
alabaster
of
her
face
nothing
seemed
to
live
except
her
black
eyes
with
the
of
shadow
suddenly
with
the
unexpectedness
that
marked
her
movements
when
she
was
very
intent
she
leant
forward
again
and
with
her
elbow
on
her
knee
her
chin
on
her
hand
said
in
a
low
voice
is
it
for
ever
for
ever
and
ever
say
it
for
ever
she
still
looked
past
him
but
her
lips
had
parted
and
her
face
wore
the
expression
of
a
child
listening
to
at
her
own
words
a
vista
seemed
to
open
up
before
her
and
at
the
other
end
in
blue
haze
shone
the
great
good
that
had
hitherto
eluded
her
i
shall
always
love
you
said
the
young
man
nothing
can
make
any
difference
for
ever
she
repeated
they
are
pretty
words
then
her
expression
changed
she
took
his
head
between
her
hands
maurice
i
older
than
you
and
i
know
better
than
you
what
all
this
means
believe
me
i
not
worth
your
love
i
only
the
shadow
of
my
old
self
and
you
are
still
so
young
and
so
so
untried
still
time
to
turn
back
and
be
wise
he
raised
his
head
what
do
you
mean
why
are
you
saying
these
things
i
shall
always
love
you
life
itself
is
nothing
to
me
without
you
i
want
you
only
you
he
put
his
arms
round
her
and
tried
to
draw
her
to
him
but
she
held
back
at
the
expression
of
her
face
he
had
a
moment
of
acute
uncertainty
and
would
have
loosened
his
hold
but
now
it
was
she
who
knotted
her
hands
round
his
neck
and
gave
him
a
long
penetrating
look
he
was
bewildered
he
did
not
understand
what
it
meant
but
it
was
something
so
strange
that
again
he
had
the
impulse
to
let
her
go
she
bent
her
head
and
laid
her
face
against
his
cheek
rested
on
cheek
he
took
her
face
between
his
hands
and
stared
into
her
eyes
as
if
to
tear
from
them
what
was
passing
in
her
brain
over
both
in
the
same
breath
swept
the
warm
irresistible
wave
of
he
caught
her
to
him
roughly
and
awkwardly
in
a
desperate
embrace
which
the
kindly
dusk
veiled
and
redeemed
xiii
now
you
will
not
leave
me
maurice
never
while
i
live
and
you
no
do
ask
me
yet
i
ca
tell
you
maurice
forgive
me
not
yet
that
after
all
you
should
care
a
little
after
all
that
you
should
care
so
much
and
it
is
for
ever
for
ever
and
ever
what
do
you
take
me
for
but
not
here
let
us
go
away
to
some
new
place
we
will
make
it
our
very
own
their
words
came
in
haste
yet
haltingly
were
all
but
inaudible
whispers
went
flying
back
and
forwards
like
brief
cries
for
aid
implying
a
peculiar
sense
of
aloofness
of
being
cut
adrift
and
thrown
on
each
other
mercy
louise
raised
her
head
yes
we
will
go
away
but
now
maurice
at
once
yes
when
you
like
the
next
morning
he
set
out
to
find
a
place
three
weeks
of
the
term
had
still
to
run
and
he
was
to
have
played
in
an
abendunterhaltung
before
the
vacation
but
compared
with
the
emotional
upheaval
he
had
undergone
this
event
was
of
small
consequence
to
schwarz
he
alleged
a
succession
of
nervous
headaches
which
interfered
with
his
work
his
looks
lent
colour
to
the
statement
and
though
as
a
rule
highly
irritated
by
opposition
to
his
plans
schwarz
only
grumbled
in
moderation
he
would
have
let
no
one
else
off
so
easily
and
at
another
time
the
knowledge
of
this
would
have
rankled
in
maurice
as
affording
a
fresh
proof
of
the
master
indifference
towards
him
as
it
was
he
was
thankful
for
the
freedom
it
secured
him
on
the
strength
of
a
chance
remark
of
madeleine
which
he
had
remembered
he
found
what
he
looked
for
without
difficulty
it
could
not
have
been
better
a
rambling
inn
with
restaurant
set
in
a
clearing
on
the
top
of
a
wooded
hill
with
an
open
view
over
the
undulating
plains
that
night
he
wrote
to
louise
from
the
rochlitzer
berg
painting
the
nest
he
had
found
for
them
in
glowing
colours
and
begging
her
to
come
without
delay
but
the
whole
of
the
next
day
passed
without
a
word
from
her
and
the
next
again
and
not
till
the
morning
of
the
third
did
he
receive
a
note
announcing
her
arrival
for
shortly
after
midday
he
took
it
with
him
to
the
woods
and
lay
at
full
length
on
the
moss
although
he
had
been
alone
now
for
more
than
hours
a
july
quiet
reigned
over
the
place
he
had
not
managed
to
think
connectedly
he
was
still
dazed
disbelieving
of
what
had
happened
again
and
again
he
told
himself
that
his
dreams
and
hopes
which
he
had
always
pushed
forward
into
a
vague
and
future
had
actually
come
to
pass
she
was
his
all
his
she
had
given
herself
ungrudgingly
as
soon
as
he
could
make
it
possible
she
would
be
his
wife
but
in
the
meantime
this
was
all
he
knew
his
nearer
vision
was
obstructed
by
the
stupefying
thought
of
the
weeks
to
come
she
was
to
be
there
beside
him
day
after
day
in
a
golden
paradise
of
love
he
could
only
think
of
it
with
moist
eyes
and
he
swore
to
himself
that
he
would
repay
her
by
being
more
infinitely
careful
of
her
than
ever
man
before
of
the
woman
he
loved
but
though
he
repeated
this
to
himself
and
believed
it
his
feelings
had
unwittingly
changed
their
pole
on
his
knees
before
her
he
had
vowed
that
her
happiness
was
the
end
of
all
his
pleading
now
it
was
frankly
happiness
he
sought
the
happiness
of
them
both
but
first
and
foremost
happiness
and
it
could
hardly
have
been
otherwise
the
one
unpremeditated
mingling
of
their
lives
had
killed
thought
he
could
only
feel
now
and
throughout
these
days
he
was
conscious
of
each
movement
he
made
as
of
a
song
sung
aloud
he
wandered
up
and
down
the
wooded
paths
blind
to
everything
but
the
image
of
her
face
which
was
always
with
him
and
oftenest
as
it
had
bent
over
him
that
last
evening
with
the
strange
new
fire
in
its
eyes
closing
his
own
he
felt
again
her
arms
on
his
shoulders
her
lips
meeting
his
and
at
such
moments
it
could
happen
that
he
threw
his
arms
round
a
tree
in
an
ungovernable
rush
of
longing
beyond
the
moment
when
he
should
clasp
her
to
him
again
he
could
not
see
the
future
was
as
indistinct
as
were
the
saxon
plains
in
the
haze
of
morning
or
evening
he
set
out
to
meet
her
far
too
early
in
the
day
and
when
he
had
covered
the
couple
of
miles
that
lay
between
the
inn
on
the
hill
and
the
at
the
foot
he
was
obliged
to
loiter
about
the
sleepy
little
town
for
over
an
hour
but
gradually
the
time
ticked
away
the
hands
of
his
watch
pointed
to
a
quarter
to
two
and
presently
he
found
himself
on
the
shadeless
sandy
station
which
lay
at
the
end
of
a
long
sandy
street
edged
with
two
rows
of
young
and
shadeless
trees
found
himself
looking
along
the
line
of
rail
that
was
to
bring
her
to
him
would
the
signal
never
go
up
he
began
to
feel
in
spite
of
the
strong
july
sunlight
that
there
was
something
illusive
about
the
whole
thing
or
perhaps
it
was
just
this
harsh
crude
light
without
relieving
shadows
which
made
his
surroundings
seem
unreal
to
him
however
it
was
the
nearer
the
moment
came
when
he
would
see
her
again
the
more
improbable
it
seemed
that
the
train
which
was
even
now
overdue
should
actually
be
carrying
her
towards
him
her
to
him
he
would
yet
waken
with
a
shock
but
then
coming
round
a
corner
in
the
distance
at
the
side
of
a
hill
he
saw
the
train
at
first
it
appeared
to
remain
stationary
then
it
increased
in
size
approached
made
a
slight
curve
and
was
a
snaky
line
it
vanished
and
reappeared
leaving
first
a
white
trail
of
cloud
then
thick
rounded
puffs
of
cloud
until
it
was
actually
there
a
great
black
object
with
a
creak
and
a
rattle
he
had
planted
himself
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
platform
and
the
carriages
went
past
him
he
hastened
almost
running
along
the
train
at
the
opposite
end
a
door
was
opened
the
porter
took
out
some
bags
and
louise
stepped
down
and
turned
to
look
for
him
he
was
the
only
person
on
the
station
besides
the
two
officials
and
in
passing
she
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
face
if
he
looks
like
that
every
one
will
know
she
thought
to
herself
and
her
first
words
as
he
came
breathlessly
up
were
maurice
you
must
look
so
glad
he
had
never
really
seen
her
till
now
when
in
a
white
dress
with
eyes
and
lips
alight
she
stood
alone
with
him
on
the
wayside
platform
to
curb
his
first
impetuous
gesture
louise
had
stretched
out
both
her
hands
he
stood
holding
them
unable
to
take
his
eyes
from
her
face
at
her
movement
to
withdraw
them
he
stooped
and
kissed
them
not
look
glad
then
you
should
have
come
they
left
her
luggage
to
be
sent
up
later
in
the
day
and
set
out
on
their
walk
going
down
the
shadeless
street
and
through
the
town
she
was
silent
at
first
as
they
went
maurice
pointed
out
things
that
he
thought
would
interest
her
and
spoke
as
if
he
attached
importance
to
them
while
in
reality
nothing
mattered
now
that
she
was
beside
him
and
gradually
he
too
lapsed
into
silence
walking
by
her
side
across
the
square
and
through
the
narrow
streets
with
the
solemnly
festive
feelings
of
a
child
on
sunday
they
crossed
the
moat
passed
through
the
gates
and
courtyard
of
the
old
castle
and
began
to
ascend
the
steep
path
that
was
a
to
the
woods
it
was
exposed
to
the
full
glare
of
the
sun
and
on
reaching
the
sheltering
trees
louise
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
and
stood
still
to
take
off
her
hat
it
so
hot
and
i
like
best
to
be
bareheaded
yes
and
now
i
can
see
you
better
is
it
really
you
at
last
i
still
ca
believe
that
you
should
have
come
to
me
yes
i
real
she
smiled
and
thrust
the
pins
through
the
crown
of
the
hat
but
very
tired
maurice
it
was
so
hot
and
the
train
was
so
slow
tired
of
course
you
must
be
come
there
a
seat
just
round
this
corner
you
shall
rest
there
they
sat
and
he
laid
his
arm
along
the
back
of
the
bench
with
his
left
hand
he
turned
her
face
towards
him
i
must
see
you
i
expect
every
minute
to
wake
and
find
it
not
true
and
yet
you
have
even
told
me
you
glad
to
see
me
glad
no
glad
is
only
a
word
she
leaned
lightly
against
the
protective
pressure
of
his
arm
on
one
of
her
hands
lying
in
her
lap
a
large
spot
of
sunlight
settled
he
stooped
and
put
his
lips
to
it
she
touched
his
head
were
the
days
long
without
me
why
did
you
come
sooner
not
that
he
cared
or
even
cared
to
know
now
that
she
was
there
but
he
wanted
to
hear
her
speak
to
remember
that
he
could
now
have
her
voice
in
his
ears
whenever
he
chose
but
louise
was
not
disposed
to
talk
the
few
words
she
said
fell
unwillingly
from
her
lips
the
stillness
of
the
forest
laid
its
spell
upon
them
each
faint
rustling
among
the
leaves
was
audible
not
a
living
thing
stirred
except
themselves
the
tall
firs
and
beeches
stretched
infinitely
upwards
and
the
patches
of
light
that
lay
here
and
there
on
the
moss
made
the
cool
darkness
seem
darker
when
they
walked
on
again
maurice
put
his
arm
through
hers
and
in
this
intimacy
of
touch
was
conscious
of
every
step
she
took
it
made
him
happy
to
suit
his
pace
to
hers
to
draw
her
aside
from
a
spreading
root
or
loose
stone
and
to
feel
her
respond
to
his
pressure
she
walked
for
the
most
part
languidly
looking
to
the
ground
but
at
a
thickly
wooded
turn
of
the
path
where
it
was
very
dark
where
the
sunlight
seemed
far
away
and
the
was
more
pungent
than
elsewhere
she
stopped
to
drink
in
the
spicy
air
with
open
lips
and
nostrils
it
like
wine
maurice
i
glad
we
came
here
that
you
found
this
place
think
of
it
we
might
still
be
sitting
indoors
with
the
blinds
drawn
knowing
that
the
pavements
were
baking
in
the
sun
while
here
oh
i
shall
be
happy
here
she
was
roused
for
a
moment
to
a
rapturous
content
with
her
surroundings
she
looked
childishly
happy
and
very
young
maurice
pressed
her
arm
without
speaking
he
was
so
foolishly
happy
that
her
praise
of
the
place
affected
him
like
praise
of
himself
again
he
had
a
chastened
feeling
of
exhilaration
as
though
an
acme
of
satisfaction
had
been
reached
beyond
which
it
was
impossible
to
go
on
catching
sight
of
the
rambling
wooden
building
in
the
midst
of
the
clearing
that
had
been
made
among
the
encroaching
trees
louise
gave
another
cry
of
pleasure
and
before
entering
the
house
went
to
the
edge
of
the
terrace
and
looked
down
on
the
plains
but
upstairs
in
her
room
on
the
first
storey
he
made
her
rest
in
an
by
the
window
he
himself
prepared
the
tea
proud
to
perform
the
first
of
the
trivial
services
which
from
now
on
were
to
be
his
there
was
nothing
he
would
not
do
for
her
and
as
a
beginning
he
persuaded
her
to
lie
down
on
the
sofa
and
try
to
sleep
once
outside
again
he
did
not
know
how
to
kill
time
and
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
seemed
interminable
he
endeavoured
to
read
but
could
not
take
in
the
meaning
of
two
consecutive
sentences
he
was
afraid
to
go
far
away
in
case
she
should
wake
and
miss
him
so
he
loitered
about
in
the
vicinity
of
the
house
and
returned
every
few
minutes
to
see
if
her
blind
were
not
drawn
up
finally
he
sat
down
at
one
of
the
tables
on
the
terrace
where
he
had
her
window
in
sight
towards
six
his
patience
was
exhausted
going
upstairs
he
listened
outside
the
door
of
her
room
not
a
sound
with
infinite
precaution
he
turned
the
handle
and
looked
in
she
was
lying
just
as
he
had
left
her
fast
asleep
her
head
was
a
little
on
one
side
her
left
hand
was
under
her
cheek
her
right
lay
palm
upwards
on
the
rug
that
covered
her
maurice
sat
down
in
the
at
first
he
looked
furtively
afraid
of
disturbing
her
then
more
openly
in
the
hope
that
she
would
waken
sitting
thus
and
thinking
over
the
miracle
that
had
happened
to
him
he
now
sought
to
find
something
in
her
face
for
him
alone
which
had
previously
not
been
there
but
his
thoughts
wandered
as
he
gazed
how
he
loved
it
this
face
of
hers
he
was
invariably
worked
on
afresh
by
the
blackness
of
the
lustreless
hair
by
the
pale
imperious
mouth
by
the
dead
white
pallor
of
the
skin
which
shaded
to
a
dusky
cream
in
the
curves
of
neck
and
throat
and
in
the
lines
beneath
the
eyes
was
of
a
bluish
brown
now
the
lashes
lay
in
these
encircling
rings
without
doubt
it
was
the
eyes
that
supplied
life
to
the
face
only
when
they
were
open
and
the
lips
parted
over
the
strong
teeth
was
it
possible
to
realise
how
intense
a
vitality
was
latent
in
her
but
his
love
would
wipe
out
the
last
trace
of
this
wan
tiredness
he
would
be
infinitely
careful
of
her
he
would
shield
her
from
the
impulsiveness
of
her
own
nature
she
should
never
have
cause
to
regret
what
she
had
done
and
the
affection
that
bound
them
would
day
by
day
grow
stronger
all
his
work
all
his
thoughts
should
belong
to
her
alone
she
would
be
his
beloved
wife
and
through
him
she
would
learn
what
love
really
was
he
rose
and
stood
over
her
longing
to
share
his
feelings
with
her
but
she
remained
sunk
in
her
placid
sleep
and
as
he
stood
he
became
conscious
of
a
different
sensation
he
had
never
seen
her
face
except
convulsed
by
weeping
when
it
was
not
under
full
control
was
it
because
he
had
stared
so
long
at
it
or
was
it
really
changed
in
sleep
there
was
something
about
it
at
this
moment
which
he
could
not
explain
it
almost
looked
less
fine
the
mouth
was
not
so
proudly
reticent
as
he
had
believed
it
to
be
there
was
even
a
want
of
restraint
about
it
and
the
chin
had
fallen
he
did
not
care
to
see
it
like
this
it
made
him
uneasy
he
stooped
and
touched
her
hand
she
started
up
and
could
not
remember
where
she
was
she
put
both
hands
to
her
forehead
maurice
what
is
it
have
i
been
asleep
long
he
held
his
watch
before
her
eyes
with
a
cry
she
sprang
to
her
feet
then
she
sent
him
downstairs
they
were
the
only
guests
they
had
supper
alone
in
a
longish
room
at
a
little
table
spread
with
a
coloured
cloth
the
window
was
open
behind
them
and
the
branches
of
the
trees
outside
hung
into
the
room
in
honour
of
the
occasion
maurice
ordered
wine
and
they
remained
sitting
after
they
had
finished
supper
listening
to
the
rustling
and
swishing
of
the
trees
the
only
drawback
to
the
young
man
happiness
was
the
pertinacious
curiosity
of
the
girl
who
waited
on
them
she
lingered
after
she
had
served
them
and
stared
so
hard
that
maurice
turned
at
length
and
asked
her
what
the
matter
was
the
girl
coloured
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
ach
fraulein
is
so
pretty
she
answered
naively
in
her
broad
saxon
dialect
both
laughed
and
louise
asked
her
name
and
if
she
always
lived
there
thus
encouraged
amalie
a
buxom
thickset
person
with
a
number
of
flaxen
plaits
came
forward
and
began
to
talk
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
louise
and
she
only
occasionally
glanced
from
her
to
the
young
man
it
nice
to
have
a
sweetheart
she
said
suddenly
louise
laughed
again
and
coloured
have
you
got
one
amalie
amalie
shook
her
head
and
launched
out
into
a
tale
of
faithlessness
and
desertion
yes
if
i
were
as
pretty
as
you
fraulein
it
would
be
a
different
thing
she
ended
with
a
hearty
sigh
maurice
clattered
up
from
the
table
all
right
amalie
that
do
they
went
out
of
doors
and
strolled
about
in
the
twilight
he
had
intended
to
show
her
some
of
the
pretty
nooks
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
house
but
she
was
not
as
affable
with
him
as
she
had
been
with
amalie
she
walked
at
his
side
with
an
air
of
preoccupied
indifference
when
they
sat
down
on
a
seat
on
the
side
of
the
hill
the
moon
had
risen
it
was
almost
at
the
full
and
a
few
gently
sailing
scraps
of
cloud
which
crossed
it
made
it
seem
to
be
coming
towards
them
the
plains
beneath
were
veiled
in
haze
detached
sounds
mounted
from
them
the
prolonged
barking
of
a
dog
the
drone
of
an
approaching
train
round
about
them
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
scent
of
the
pines
maurice
had
taken
her
hand
and
sat
holding
it
it
was
the
one
thing
that
existed
for
him
all
else
was
vague
and
unreal
only
their
two
hearts
beat
in
all
the
universe
but
there
was
no
interchange
between
them
of
binding
words
or
endearments
such
as
pass
between
most
lovers
how
long
they
sat
neither
could
have
told
but
suddenly
far
below
a
human
voice
was
raised
in
a
long
cry
which
echoed
against
the
side
of
the
hill
louise
shivered
and
he
had
a
moment
of
apprehension
you
cold
we
have
sat
too
long
let
us
go
they
rose
and
walked
slowly
back
to
the
house
although
the
doors
were
still
open
the
building
was
in
darkness
and
they
had
to
grope
their
way
up
the
stairs
outside
her
room
he
paused
to
light
the
candle
that
was
standing
on
the
table
but
louise
opened
the
door
and
went
in
as
she
did
so
she
gave
a
cry
the
blind
had
not
been
lowered
and
a
patch
of
moonlight
lay
on
the
floor
before
the
window
throwing
the
rest
of
the
room
into
massy
shadow
she
went
forward
and
stood
in
it
do
make
a
light
she
said
to
him
over
her
shoulder
maurice
put
down
the
matches
with
which
he
had
been
fumbling
went
quickly
in
after
her
and
shut
the
door
before
anyone
else
was
astir
he
had
flung
out
into
the
freshness
of
the
morning
it
was
cool
in
the
shade
of
the
woods
grass
and
moss
were
a
little
moist
with
dew
he
did
not
linger
under
the
trees
he
needed
movement
and
striding
along
the
which
ran
down
the
hill
where
the
incline
was
easiest
he
went
out
on
the
plains
among
the
little
villages
that
dotted
the
level
land
like
huge
clumps
of
mushrooms
he
carried
his
cap
in
his
hand
and
let
the
early
sun
play
on
his
head
when
he
returned
it
was
nine
and
he
was
ravenously
hungry
amalie
carried
the
coffee
and
the
crisp
brown
rolls
to
one
of
the
small
tables
on
the
terrace
and
herself
stood
after
she
had
served
him
and
looked
over
the
edge
of
the
hill
when
he
had
finished
eating
he
opened
a
volume
of
dichtung
und
wahrheit
which
he
carried
in
his
pocket
and
began
to
read
but
after
a
few
lines
his
thoughts
wandered
the
book
had
a
chilling
effect
on
him
in
his
present
mood
the
writing
seemed
stiff
and
strained
the
work
of
a
very
old
man
at
first
that
morning
he
had
not
ventured
to
review
even
in
thought
the
past
hours
now
however
that
he
was
again
within
a
stone
throw
of
louise
memories
crowded
upon
him
he
gazed
with
a
passion
of
gratefulness
at
her
window
one
detail
stood
out
more
vividly
than
all
the
rest
it
was
that
of
waking
suddenly
at
dawn
from
a
dreamless
sleep
and
of
finding
on
his
pillow
a
thick
tress
of
black
ruffled
hair
for
a
moment
he
had
hardly
been
able
to
believe
his
eyes
and
even
yet
the
mere
remembrance
of
this
dusky
hair
on
the
whiteness
seemed
to
bring
what
had
happened
home
to
him
as
nothing
else
could
have
done
she
had
slept
on
undisturbed
and
she
was
still
asleep
to
judge
from
the
lowered
blind
but
though
hours
seemed
to
pass
while
he
sat
there
he
was
not
dissatisfied
it
was
enough
to
know
how
near
she
was
to
him
when
she
came
she
was
upon
him
before
he
was
aware
of
it
at
the
light
step
behind
he
sprang
from
his
seat
at
last
are
you
tired
of
waiting
for
me
she
was
in
the
same
white
dress
and
a
hat
fell
over
her
forehead
he
did
not
answer
her
words
for
amalie
followed
on
her
heels
with
fresh
coffee
and
made
a
great
business
of
the
table
wunsche
guten
appetit
the
girl
retired
to
a
distance
but
still
lingered
keeping
them
in
sight
maurice
leaned
across
the
table
tell
me
how
you
are
have
you
forgotten
me
he
tried
to
take
her
hand
take
care
maurice
we
can
be
seen
here
how
that
girl
stares
why
does
she
go
away
she
is
envying
me
my
sweetheart
again
who
wo
let
me
eat
my
breakfast
i
been
alone
for
hours
louise
tell
me
what
i
want
to
know
yes
afterwards
the
coffee
is
getting
cold
he
sat
back
and
watched
her
movements
with
fanatic
eyes
she
was
not
confused
by
the
insistence
of
his
gaze
but
she
did
not
return
it
she
was
paler
than
usual
and
the
lines
beneath
her
eyes
were
blacker
maurice
believed
that
he
could
detect
a
new
note
in
her
voice
this
morning
and
he
tried
to
make
her
speak
in
order
that
he
might
hear
it
but
she
was
as
chary
of
her
words
as
of
her
looks
attracted
by
the
two
strangers
a
little
child
of
the
landlord
came
running
up
to
stare
shyly
she
spread
a
piece
of
bread
with
honey
and
gave
it
to
the
child
he
was
absurdly
jealous
and
she
knew
it
for
the
rest
of
the
morning
she
would
have
been
content
to
bask
in
the
sun
but
when
she
saw
how
impatient
he
was
she
gave
way
and
they
went
out
of
the
sight
of
other
people
into
the
friendly
screening
woods
i
thought
you
would
never
come
why
did
you
wake
me
oh
gently
maurice
you
forget
that
i
just
done
my
hair
i
shall
forget
everything
let
me
look
at
you
again
right
into
your
eyes
you
believe
i
real
do
you
are
you
satisfied
and
you
louise
you
say
you
happy
too
they
came
upon
the
friedrich
august
turm
a
stone
tower
standing
on
the
highest
point
of
the
hill
beside
a
large
quarry
and
too
idly
happy
to
refuse
climbed
the
stone
steps
led
by
a
persuasive
old
pensioner
who
on
the
platform
at
the
top
adjusted
the
telescope
and
pointed
out
the
distant
landmarks
with
something
of
an
owner
pride
on
this
morning
maurice
would
not
have
been
greatly
surprised
to
hear
that
the
streaky
headline
of
the
dover
coast
was
visible
he
had
eyes
for
her
alone
as
with
assumed
interest
she
followed
the
old
hand
learned
where
leipzig
lay
and
how
on
a
clear
day
its
many
spires
could
be
distinguished
over
there
maurice
a
little
more
to
the
right
how
far
away
we
seem
leaning
against
the
parapet
he
continued
to
look
at
her
the
few
ordinary
words
meant
in
reality
something
quite
different
it
was
as
if
she
had
said
to
him
yes
yes
be
at
rest
i
am
still
yours
and
he
told
himself
with
a
feverish
pleasure
that
from
now
on
everything
she
said
in
the
presence
of
others
would
be
a
cloak
for
what
she
really
meant
to
say
he
had
been
right
there
was
a
new
tone
in
her
voice
this
morning
an
imperceptible
vibration
a
sensuous
undertone
which
seemed
to
have
been
left
over
from
those
moments
when
it
had
quivered
like
a
roughly
touched
string
beneath
a
bow
going
down
the
steps
behind
her
he
heard
her
dress
swish
from
step
to
step
and
saw
the
fine
grace
of
her
strong
supple
body
at
a
bend
in
the
stair
he
held
her
back
and
kissed
her
neck
just
where
the
hair
stopped
growing
on
the
she
paused
to
pick
out
a
trifle
from
a
table
set
with
mementoes
the
old
man
praised
his
wares
with
zeal
taking
up
this
and
that
in
his
old
reddened
hands
on
which
the
skin
was
drawn
and
glazed
like
a
coating
of
gelatine
louise
chose
a
carved
wooden
pen
a
tiny
round
of
glass
was
set
in
the
handle
through
which
might
be
seen
a
view
of
the
tower
with
an
encircling
motto
after
this
he
had
her
to
himself
for
the
rest
of
the
day
they
sat
on
a
seat
that
was
screened
by
trees
and
thickly
grown
about
his
arm
lay
along
the
back
of
the
bench
and
every
now
and
then
his
hand
sought
and
pressed
the
warm
soft
round
of
her
shoulder
in
this
attitude
he
poured
out
his
heart
to
her
hitherto
the
very
essence
of
his
love
had
been
taciturn
endurance
now
he
felt
how
infinitely
much
he
had
to
say
to
her
all
that
he
had
undergone
since
knowing
her
first
all
the
hopes
and
feelings
that
had
so
long
been
pent
up
in
him
struggled
to
escape
now
there
was
no
hindrance
to
his
telling
her
everything
it
was
not
only
permissible
but
right
that
he
should
henceforth
there
must
be
no
strangeness
between
them
no
knowledge
pleasant
or
unpleasant
that
she
did
not
share
and
he
went
back
and
dwelt
on
details
and
events
long
past
which
unknown
to
himself
his
memory
had
stored
up
but
it
was
chiefly
the
restless
misery
of
the
past
half
year
that
was
his
theme
he
took
the
same
pleasure
in
reciting
it
now
that
it
was
over
as
the
convalescent
in
relating
his
sufferings
besides
that
it
was
easier
there
being
nothing
to
conceal
whereas
in
referring
to
an
earlier
time
a
certain
name
had
to
be
shirked
and
gone
round
about
like
a
his
impassioned
words
knew
no
halt
he
was
amazed
at
his
own
eloquence
and
the
burden
of
months
fell
away
from
him
as
he
talked
the
receptiveness
of
her
silence
spurred
him
on
she
sat
motionless
with
loosely
clasped
hands
and
spots
of
light
settled
on
her
bare
head
and
on
the
white
stuff
of
her
dress
occasionally
at
something
he
said
a
smile
would
raise
the
corners
of
her
mouth
sometimes
but
less
often
she
turned
her
head
with
incredulous
eyes
but
though
she
was
emotionally
so
irresponsive
maurice
had
the
feeling
that
she
was
content
even
happy
to
sit
inactive
at
his
side
and
listen
to
his
story
each
of
these
first
wonderful
days
was
of
the
same
pattern
they
themselves
lost
count
of
time
so
like
was
one
day
to
another
and
yet
each
that
passed
was
a
little
eternity
in
itself
the
weather
was
superb
and
to
them
in
their
egotism
it
came
to
seem
in
the
order
of
things
that
they
should
rise
in
the
morning
to
cloudless
skies
and
golden
sunshine
that
the
cool
green
seclusion
of
the
woods
should
be
theirs
where
they
were
more
securely
shut
off
from
the
world
than
inside
the
house
louise
lay
on
the
moss
with
her
arms
under
her
head
or
sat
with
her
back
against
a
maurice
was
always
in
front
of
her
so
that
he
could
see
her
face
as
he
talked
this
face
of
which
he
could
never
see
enough
he
was
happy
in
a
dazed
way
he
could
not
appraise
the
extent
of
his
happiness
all
at
once
its
chief
outward
sign
was
the
nervous
flood
of
talk
that
poured
from
his
lips
as
though
they
had
been
sealed
and
stopped
for
years
but
louise
urged
him
on
what
he
had
first
felt
dimly
he
soon
knew
for
certain
that
she
was
never
tired
of
learning
how
much
he
loved
her
how
he
had
hoped
and
ventured
and
despaired
and
how
he
had
been
prepared
to
lose
her
up
to
the
very
last
day
she
also
made
him
describe
to
her
more
than
once
how
he
had
first
seen
her
his
indelible
impression
of
her
as
she
played
her
appearance
at
his
side
in
the
how
he
had
followed
her
out
and
looked
for
her
and
had
vainly
tried
to
learn
who
she
was
i
stood
quite
close
to
you
you
say
maurice
perhaps
i
even
looked
at
you
how
strange
things
are
still
the
interest
she
displayed
was
of
a
wholly
passive
kind
she
took
no
part
herself
in
this
building
up
of
the
past
she
left
it
to
him
just
as
she
left
all
that
called
for
firmness
or
decision
in
this
new
phase
of
her
life
the
chief
step
taken
it
seemed
as
if
no
further
initiative
were
left
in
her
she
let
herself
be
loved
waited
for
everything
to
come
from
him
was
without
will
or
wish
he
had
to
ask
no
of
her
now
no
impulsive
resolutions
over
all
she
did
lay
a
subtle
languor
and
her
abandon
was
absolute
he
heard
it
in
the
very
way
she
said
his
name
in
the
first
riotous
joy
of
possession
maurice
had
been
conscious
of
the
change
in
her
as
of
something
inexpressibly
sweet
and
tender
implying
a
boundless
faith
in
him
but
before
long
it
made
him
uneasy
he
had
imagined
several
things
as
likely
to
happen
had
imagined
her
the
cooler
and
wiser
of
the
two
checking
him
and
chiding
him
for
his
had
imagined
even
moments
of
on
her
part
when
she
came
to
think
over
what
she
had
done
what
he
had
not
imagined
was
the
wordless
unthinking
fashion
in
which
she
gave
herself
into
his
hands
the
very
expression
of
her
face
altered
in
these
days
the
somewhat
defiant
bitter
lines
he
had
so
loved
in
it
and
behind
which
she
had
screened
herself
were
smoothed
out
the
lips
seemed
to
meet
differently
were
sweeter
even
tremulous
the
eyes
were
more
veiled
far
less
sure
of
themselves
he
did
not
admit
to
himself
how
difficult
she
made
things
for
him
strengthened
from
the
first
by
his
good
resolutions
he
was
determined
not
to
let
himself
be
carried
off
his
feet
but
it
would
have
been
easier
for
him
to
stand
firm
had
she
met
him
in
almost
any
other
way
than
this
even
with
a
frank
return
of
feeling
for
then
they
might
have
spoken
openly
and
have
helped
each
other
as
it
was
he
had
no
thoughts
but
of
her
his
watchful
tenderness
knew
no
bounds
but
the
whole
responsibility
was
his
it
was
he
who
had
to
maintain
the
happy
mean
in
their
relations
he
to
draw
the
line
beyond
which
it
was
better
for
all
their
that
they
should
not
go
he
affirmed
to
himself
more
than
once
that
he
loved
her
the
more
for
her
complete
subjection
it
was
in
keeping
with
her
openhanded
nature
which
could
do
nothing
by
halves
yet
as
time
passed
he
began
to
suffer
under
it
to
feel
her
absence
of
will
as
a
disquieting
factor
to
find
anything
to
which
he
could
compare
it
he
had
to
hark
back
to
the
state
she
had
been
in
when
he
first
offered
her
aid
and
comfort
that
was
the
lassitude
of
grief
this
of
he
could
not
find
a
word
but
it
began
to
tell
on
him
and
more
than
once
made
him
a
little
sharp
with
her
for
at
moments
he
would
be
seized
by
an
overpowering
temptation
to
shake
her
out
of
her
lassitude
to
rouse
her
as
he
very
well
knew
she
could
be
roused
and
then
strange
desires
awoke
in
him
he
did
not
himself
know
of
what
he
was
capable
one
afternoon
they
were
in
the
woods
as
usual
it
was
very
sultry
not
a
leaf
stirred
louise
lay
with
her
elbow
on
the
roots
of
a
tree
her
eyes
were
heavy
maurice
before
her
smoked
a
cigarette
and
watched
for
the
least
recognition
of
his
presence
thinking
meanwhile
that
she
looked
better
already
for
these
days
spent
the
tiny
lines
round
her
eyes
were
fast
disappearing
by
degrees
however
he
grew
restless
under
her
protracted
silence
there
was
something
ominous
about
it
he
threw
his
cigarette
away
and
taking
her
hand
began
to
pull
apart
the
long
fingers
with
the
small
pink
nails
or
to
gather
them
together
and
let
them
drop
one
by
one
like
warm
but
lifeless
things
what
are
you
thinking
of
he
asked
at
last
and
shut
her
hand
firmly
within
his
she
started
i
thinking
i
do
know
i
was
thinking
at
all
but
you
were
i
saw
it
in
your
face
your
thoughts
were
miles
away
i
do
know
maurice
i
could
tell
you
now
and
a
moment
later
she
added
you
think
one
must
always
be
thinking
when
one
is
silent
yes
i
jealous
of
your
thoughts
you
tell
me
nothing
of
them
but
now
you
have
come
back
to
me
and
it
all
right
he
drew
her
nearer
to
him
by
the
hand
he
held
and
putting
his
arm
under
her
neck
bent
her
head
back
on
the
moss
her
stretched
throat
was
marked
by
two
encircling
lines
he
traced
them
with
his
finger
she
lay
and
smiled
at
him
but
her
eyes
remained
shaded
they
were
meditative
and
seemed
to
be
considering
him
a
little
deliberately
tell
me
louise
he
said
suddenly
why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
it
not
the
first
time
i
seen
it
before
and
then
i
ca
help
thinking
there
some
mistake
that
after
all
you
do
really
care
for
me
it
is
so
so
critical
you
are
curious
maurice
yes
there
so
much
i
want
to
know
and
you
tell
me
nothing
it
is
i
who
talk
and
talk
till
you
must
be
tired
of
hearing
me
no
i
like
to
listen
best
and
i
have
nothing
to
say
nothing
really
nothing
only
that
i
glad
to
be
here
that
i
am
happy
he
kissed
her
on
the
throat
the
eyes
and
the
lips
kissed
her
until
under
his
touch
that
vague
elusive
influence
began
to
emanate
from
her
which
he
was
aware
might
some
day
overpower
him
and
drag
him
down
they
were
quite
alone
shut
in
by
high
trees
no
one
would
find
them
or
disturb
them
and
it
was
just
this
mysterious
power
in
her
that
his
nerves
had
dreamed
of
waking
yet
now
some
inexplicable
instinct
made
him
hesitate
and
forbear
he
drew
his
arm
from
under
her
head
and
rose
to
his
feet
where
he
stood
looking
down
at
her
she
lay
just
as
he
had
left
her
and
he
felt
unaccountably
impatient
there
it
is
again
he
cried
you
are
looking
at
me
just
as
you
did
before
louise
passed
her
hand
over
her
eyes
and
sat
up
why
maurice
what
do
you
mean
it
was
nothing
only
something
i
was
trying
to
understand
but
what
it
was
that
she
did
not
understand
he
could
not
get
her
to
tell
him
a
fortnight
passed
one
morning
when
a
soft
south
breeze
was
in
motion
maurice
reminded
her
with
an
air
of
playful
severity
that
so
far
they
had
not
learned
to
know
even
their
nearer
surroundings
while
of
all
the
romantic
explorings
in
the
pretty
muldental
which
he
had
had
in
view
for
them
not
one
had
been
undertaken
louise
was
not
fond
of
walking
in
the
country
she
tired
easily
and
was
always
content
to
bask
in
the
sun
and
be
still
but
she
did
not
attempt
to
oppose
his
wish
she
put
on
her
hat
and
was
ready
to
start
his
love
of
movement
reasserted
itself
they
went
down
the
and
out
upon
the
long
roads
that
zigzagged
the
plains
connecting
the
dotted
villages
these
roads
were
edged
with
apple
and
cherry
the
apples
were
still
hard
green
polished
balls
but
the
berries
were
at
their
prime
and
everywhere
men
were
aloft
on
ladders
gathering
the
fruit
for
market
for
the
sum
of
ten
pfennigs
maurice
could
get
his
hat
filled
and
by
the
roadside
they
would
sit
down
to
make
a
second
breakfast
off
black
luscious
cherries
which
stained
the
lips
a
bluish
purple
when
it
grew
too
hot
for
the
open
roads
they
descended
the
steep
wooded
back
of
the
bill
to
the
romantic
little
town
of
wechselburg
at
its
base
here
a
massive
bridge
of
stone
spanned
the
winding
mulde
a
sombre
castle
of
the
same
stone
as
the
bridge
looked
out
over
a
wall
of
magnificent
chestnuts
on
returning
from
these
and
various
other
excursions
they
were
pleasantly
tired
and
hungry
after
supper
they
sat
upstairs
by
the
window
in
her
room
louise
in
the
big
chair
maurice
at
her
feet
and
there
watched
the
darkness
come
down
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
somewhat
later
in
the
month
the
fancy
took
her
to
go
to
a
place
called
amerika
maurice
consulted
the
landlord
about
the
distance
their
original
plan
of
taking
the
train
a
part
of
the
way
was
however
abandoned
when
the
morning
came
for
it
was
an
uncommonly
lovely
day
and
a
fresh
breeze
was
blowing
so
having
scrambled
down
to
wechselburg
again
they
struck
out
on
the
flat
and
began
their
walk
the
whole
day
lay
before
them
they
were
bound
to
no
fixed
hours
and
throughout
the
morning
they
made
frequent
halts
to
gather
the
wild
raspberries
that
grew
by
the
roadside
having
passed
under
a
great
railway
viaduct
which
dominated
the
landscape
they
stopped
at
a
village
inn
to
rest
and
drink
coffee
about
two
they
came
to
rochsburg
and
finally
arrived
towards
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
at
the
picturesque
restaurant
that
bore
the
name
of
amerika
here
they
dined
afterwards
they
returned
to
rochsburg
but
much
less
buoyantly
for
louise
was
growing
footsore
paid
a
were
shown
through
the
castle
and
at
sunset
found
themselves
on
the
little
waiting
for
an
overdue
train
the
restaurant
in
which
they
sat
was
a
kind
of
shed
roofed
by
a
covering
of
virginia
creeper
the
station
stood
on
an
eminence
the
plains
stretched
before
them
as
far
as
they
could
see
the
evening
sky
was
an
unbroken
sheet
of
red
and
gold
the
journey
over
it
was
made
in
a
narrow
wooden
compartment
crowded
with
peasants
returning
from
a
market
they
left
the
train
and
began
to
climb
the
hill
but
by
now
louise
was
at
the
end
of
her
strength
and
maurice
began
to
fear
that
he
would
never
get
her
home
she
could
with
difficulty
drag
one
foot
after
the
other
and
had
to
rest
every
few
minutes
so
that
it
was
nearly
ten
before
they
entered
the
house
in
her
room
he
knelt
before
her
and
took
off
her
boots
amalie
carried
her
supper
up
on
a
tray
she
hardly
touched
it
her
eyes
were
closing
with
fatigue
and
she
was
asleep
as
soon
as
her
head
touched
the
pillow
next
day
she
did
not
waken
till
nearly
noon
and
she
remained
in
bed
till
after
dinner
for
the
rest
of
the
day
she
sat
in
the
armchair
maurice
wished
to
read
to
her
but
she
preferred
quiet
did
not
even
want
to
be
talked
to
the
weather
was
on
her
nerves
she
said
for
it
had
grown
very
sultry
and
the
sky
was
overcast
the
landlord
prophesied
a
thunderstorm
in
the
evening
however
as
it
was
still
dry
and
he
had
been
in
the
house
all
day
maurice
went
out
for
a
solitary
walk
he
swung
down
the
road
at
a
pace
he
could
only
make
when
he
was
alone
it
had
looked
threatening
when
he
left
the
house
but
as
he
went
the
clouds
piled
themselves
up
with
inconceivable
rapidity
and
before
he
was
three
miles
out
on
the
plain
the
storm
broke
with
a
sudden
fury
from
which
there
was
no
escape
he
took
to
his
heels
and
ran
to
the
next
village
some
quarter
of
a
mile
in
front
of
him
there
in
the
smoky
room
of
a
tiny
inn
together
with
a
handful
of
he
was
held
a
prisoner
for
over
two
hours
the
rain
pelted
and
the
thunder
cracked
immediately
overhead
when
drenched
to
the
skin
he
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
again
it
was
going
on
for
midnight
he
had
been
absent
for
close
on
four
hours
the
candle
in
her
room
was
guttering
in
its
socket
by
its
failing
light
he
saw
that
she
was
lying
across
the
bed
still
dressed
over
her
bent
amalie
he
had
visions
of
sudden
illness
and
brushed
the
girl
aside
what
is
it
what
the
matter
at
his
voice
louise
lifted
a
wild
face
stared
at
him
as
though
she
did
not
recognise
him
then
rose
with
a
cry
and
flung
herself
upon
him
take
care
i
wet
through
for
all
answer
she
burst
out
crying
and
trembled
from
head
to
foot
what
is
it
darling
were
you
afraid
but
she
only
clung
to
him
and
trembled
amalie
was
weeping
with
equal
vehemence
he
ordered
her
out
of
the
room
notwithstanding
his
dripping
clothes
he
was
forced
to
support
louise
in
vain
he
implored
her
to
speak
it
was
long
before
she
was
in
a
state
to
reply
to
his
questionings
outside
the
storm
still
raged
it
was
a
wild
night
what
was
it
were
you
afraid
did
you
think
i
was
lost
i
do
know
oh
maurice
you
will
never
leave
me
will
you
she
wounded
her
lips
against
his
shoulder
leave
you
what
has
put
such
foolish
thoughts
into
your
head
i
do
but
on
a
night
like
this
i
feel
that
anything
might
happen
and
did
it
really
matter
so
much
whether
i
came
back
or
not
he
felt
her
arms
tighten
round
him
did
you
care
as
much
as
that
louise
i
said
my
god
what
if
he
should
never
come
back
and
then
then
then
and
then
the
noise
of
the
storm
and
i
was
so
alone
and
all
the
long
long
hours
and
at
every
sound
i
said
there
he
is
and
it
never
was
you
till
i
knew
you
were
lying
somewhere
dead
under
a
tree
you
poor
little
soul
he
began
impulsively
then
stopped
for
he
felt
the
sudden
thrill
that
ran
through
her
say
that
again
maurice
say
it
again
you
poor
little
soul
oh
if
you
knew
how
good
it
sounds
if
i
could
make
you
understand
you
the
only
person
who
has
ever
said
a
thing
like
that
to
me
the
only
one
who
has
ever
been
in
the
least
sorry
for
me
promise
me
now
promise
again
that
you
will
never
leave
for
you
are
all
i
have
promise
again
when
you
are
more
to
me
than
my
own
life
and
you
will
never
get
tired
of
me
never
my
own
dear
wife
she
strained
him
to
her
with
a
strength
for
which
he
would
not
have
given
her
credit
he
tried
to
see
her
face
do
you
know
what
that
means
yes
i
know
it
means
if
you
leave
me
now
i
shall
die
by
the
next
morning
all
traces
of
the
storm
had
vanished
the
sun
shone
the
slanting
roads
were
hard
and
dry
again
other
storms
followed
for
it
was
an
exceptionally
hot
summer
and
many
an
evening
the
two
were
prisoners
in
her
room
listening
to
the
angry
roar
of
the
trees
which
lashed
each
other
with
a
sound
like
that
of
the
open
sea
every
sunday
in
august
too
brought
a
motley
crowd
of
guests
to
the
inn
and
then
the
whole
terrace
was
set
out
with
little
tables
two
waiters
came
to
assist
amalie
a
band
played
in
an
arbour
carts
and
wagonettes
were
hitched
to
the
front
of
the
house
and
the
noise
and
lasted
till
late
in
the
night
together
they
leaned
from
the
window
of
louise
room
to
watch
the
people
they
hardly
ventured
out
of
doors
for
it
was
unpleasant
to
see
their
favourite
nooks
invaded
by
strangers
except
on
sundays
however
their
seclusion
remained
undisturbed
half
a
dozen
visitors
were
staying
in
the
other
wing
of
the
building
and
of
these
they
sometimes
caught
a
glimpse
at
meals
but
that
was
all
the
solitude
they
desired
was
still
theirs
and
so
the
happy
days
slid
past
august
was
well
advanced
by
this
time
and
the
tropical
heat
was
at
its
height
in
the
beginning
it
had
been
maurice
who
regretted
the
rapid
flight
of
the
days
now
it
was
louise
occasionally
a
certain
shadow
settled
on
her
face
and
at
such
moments
he
well
knew
what
she
was
thinking
of
for
once
out
of
the
very
fulness
of
his
content
he
had
said
to
her
with
a
lazy
sigh
is
the
first
of
august
and
then
for
the
first
time
he
had
seen
this
look
of
intense
regret
cross
her
face
she
had
entreated
him
not
to
say
any
more
and
after
that
the
speed
with
which
the
month
decreased
was
not
mentioned
between
them
but
his
carelessly
dropped
words
had
sown
their
seed
a
couple
of
weeks
later
the
remembrance
of
the
work
he
had
still
to
do
for
schwarz
before
the
beginning
of
the
new
term
broke
over
him
like
a
douche
of
cold
water
it
was
a
resplendent
morning
he
had
been
leaning
out
of
the
window
idly
tapping
his
fingers
on
the
sill
suddenly
they
seemed
to
him
to
have
grown
stiff
to
have
lost
their
agility
and
by
the
thoughts
that
now
came
he
was
so
disquieted
that
he
shut
himself
up
in
his
own
room
at
his
first
words
to
her
louise
who
was
still
in
bed
turned
pale
yes
yes
be
quiet
i
know
she
said
and
buried
her
face
in
the
down
pillow
in
this
position
she
remained
for
some
seconds
maurice
stood
staring
out
of
the
window
then
without
raising
her
face
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
he
took
it
but
he
did
not
do
what
she
expected
he
would
sit
down
on
the
side
of
the
bed
and
put
his
arm
round
her
he
stood
holding
it
she
stole
a
glance
at
him
and
turned
still
paler
then
with
a
jerk
she
released
her
hand
sat
up
in
bed
and
pushed
her
hair
from
her
face
maurice
then
if
it
has
to
be
then
please
please
do
ask
me
to
stay
here
and
think
and
remember
that
all
over
that
this
is
the
end
that
we
shall
never
never
be
here
in
this
little
room
again
oh
i
could
bear
it
ca
bear
it
maurice
let
us
go
away
please
let
us
go
in
vain
he
urged
reason
there
was
no
gainsaying
her
she
brushed
aside
without
listening
to
it
his
objection
that
their
rooms
in
leipzig
would
not
be
ready
for
them
throwing
back
the
bedclothes
she
got
up
at
once
and
dressed
herself
with
cold
fingers
then
flung
herself
upon
the
packing
helped
and
hindered
by
amalie
who
wept
beside
her
the
hour
that
followed
was
like
a
bad
dream
finally
however
the
luggage
was
carried
downstairs
the
bill
paid
and
the
circumstantial
were
said
they
set
off
at
full
speed
down
the
woodpath
to
the
station
to
catch
the
midday
train
louise
was
white
with
exhaustion
her
breath
came
sobbingly
in
a
firstclass
carriage
he
made
her
lie
down
on
the
seat
with
her
hand
in
his
he
said
what
he
could
to
comfort
her
for
her
face
was
tragic
we
will
come
again
darling
it
is
only
auf
wiedersehen
remember
but
she
shook
her
head
we
shall
never
be
here
again
leipzig
at
three
on
an
august
afternoon
lay
baking
in
the
sun
he
put
her
in
a
covered
droschke
himself
carrying
the
bags
for
he
could
not
find
a
porter
at
seven
then
try
to
sleep
you
are
so
pale
his
hand
rested
on
the
door
of
the
droschke
she
laid
hers
on
it
and
clung
to
it
as
though
she
would
never
let
it
go
part
iii
dove
il

was
ill
pleased
at
his
reappearance
and
did
not
scruple
to
say
so
from
the
condition
of
disorder
in
which
he
found
his
room
maurice
judged
that
it
had
been
occupied
during
his
absence
by
the
entire
family
having
been
caught
napping
frau
krause
carried
the
matter
off
with
a
high
hand
she
gave
him
to
understand
that
his
behaviour
in
descending
upon
her
thus
was
not
that
of
a
decent
lodger
maurice
never
parleyed
with
her
ascertaining
by
a
glance
that
his
books
and
music
had
been
left
untouched
he
made
his
escape
from
the
pails
of
water
that
were
straightway
brought
into
evidence
as
well
as
from
her
irate
assurances
that
the
room
would
be
ready
for
him
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
went
into
the
town
and
did
various
small
errands
necessary
to
the
taking
up
anew
of
the
old
life
after
he
had
had
dinner
and
had
looked
through
the
newspapers
the
temptation
was
strong
to
go
to
louise
and
spend
the
hot
afternoon
hours
at
her
side
but
he
resisted
for
that
would
have
been
a
poor
beginning
to
the
sensible
way
of
life
they
would
have
to
follow
from
now
on
besides
with
the
certainty
of
seeing
her
again
in
a
very
short
time
it
was
not
impossible
to
be
patient
no
more
uncertainty
no
more
doubts
and
fears
the
day
for
these
was
and
so
having
satisfied
himself
that
his
room
was
still
uninhabitable
he
strolled
to
the
conservatorium
to
see
what
notices
had
remained
affixed
to
the
as
he
was
leaving
again
he
met
the
janitor
and
from
him
learned
that
his
name
was
down
for
the
first
adbendunterhaltung
of
the
coming
month
in
the
shadeless
street
he
paused
irresolute
the
heat
of
the
slumbrous
afternoon
was
oppressive
all
animation
seemed
suspended
the
trees
in
streets
and
gardens
drooped
brownishyellow
and
heavy
with
dust
the
sun
met
the
eyes
blindingly
and
was
reflected
from
every
maurice
went
for
a
walk
in
the
woods
in
his
pocket
he
had
a
letter
still
unread
which
he
had
found
waiting
for
him
that
day
it
was
from
his
mother
and
his
eyes
slid
carelessly
over
the
pages
there
were
the
usual
reproaches
for
his
prolonged
silences
the
reminders
that
his
time
in
leipzig
would
come
to
an
end
the
following
spring
as
well
as
several
details
of
domestic
interest
then
however
followed
a
piece
of
news
which
rallied
his
attention
you
will
doubtless
be
interested
to
hear
she
wrote
that
your
friend
the
old
music
teacher
in
norwich
died
suddenly
last
week
his
pupils
had
fallen
off
greatly
of
late
and
when
everything
had
been
sold
there
was
scarcely
enough
to
cover
the
funeral
expenses
your
father
thinks
that
though
a
young
person
from
london
of
the
name
of
smith
or
smythe
has
lately
set
up
there
and
attracted
many
of
the
best
paying
families
yet
the
old
connection
might
be
worked
up
again
and
it
would
be
worth
your
while
trying
to
do
it
at
first
you
could
live
at
home
and
go
over
once
or
twice
a
week
your
father
has
been
making
inquiries
about
a
suitable
room
this
news
called
up
a
feeling
of
repugnance
in
maurice
it
came
like
a
message
from
another
world
the
very
baldness
of
its
expression
seemed
to
throw
him
back
at
one
stroke
into
the
hated
atmosphere
of
his
home
he
folded
the
letter
and
replaced
it
in
the
envelope
with
such
a
conscious
hostility
to
all
that
his
did
or
said
as
he
had
not
felt
since
the
day
when
in
their
midst
he
had
struggled
to
assert
his
independence
how
little
they
understood
him
it
was
like
them
in
their
unimaginative
dulness
to
suppose
that
they
could
arrange
his
life
for
him
draw
up
the
lines
on
which
it
was
to
be
spent
he
saw
himself
bound
down
hand
and
foot
again
to
the
occupation
he
so
hated
saw
himself
striving
to
oust
the
young
person
from
london
just
as
no
doubt
his
old
friend
had
striven
saw
himself
becoming
proficient
in
all
the
mean
petty
tricks
of
rival
teachers
and
either
vanquishing
or
being
vanquished
in
the
effort
to
earn
a
living
however
he
viewed
them
his
prospects
had
nothing
hopeful
in
them
they
were
vague
too
to
the
last
degree
on
one
question
alone
was
his
mind
made
up
he
meant
to
marry
louise
at
the
earliest
possible
date
whatever
else
happened
this
should
come
to
pass
for
the
first
time
he
thought
with
something
akin
to
remorse
over
the
turn
affairs
had
taken
he
had
been
blind
and
dizzy
with
his
infatuation
sick
for
her
to
his
very
marrow
he
could
only
look
back
on
those
feverish
weeks
in
june
as
on
the
horrors
of
a
nightmare
and
he
would
not
have
missed
a
single
hour
of
the
happy
days
at
rochlitz
but
none
the
less
he
had
always
felt
a
peculiar
aversion
to
people
who
allowed
their
feelings
to
get
the
better
of
them
now
he
himself
was
one
of
them
if
only
she
were
his
wife
had
she
consented
he
would
have
married
her
there
and
then
without
reflection
they
might
have
lived
on
just
as
they
were
going
to
do
and
have
kept
their
marriage
a
secret
reserving
to
themselves
the
pleasure
of
knowing
that
their
intimacy
was
legal
at
it
was
he
must
console
himself
with
the
thought
that
married
or
not
they
were
indissolubly
bound
he
knew
now
better
than
before
that
no
other
woman
would
ever
exist
for
him
and
surely
in
the
case
of
an
passion
such
as
this
the
overstepping
of
conventional
boundaries
would
not
be
counted
too
heavily
against
them
laws
and
conventions
existed
only
for
the
weak
and
vacillating
loves
of
the
rest
of
the
world
then
however
and
almost
against
his
will
the
other
side
of
the
question
forced
itself
upon
his
notice
as
the
marriage
had
not
already
taken
place
as
indeed
louise
chose
to
evade
the
subject
when
he
brought
it
up
he
could
not
but
admit
to
it
would
be
pleasanter
for
him
if
it
were
now
postponed
until
he
was
independent
of
his
family
would
he
knew
bitterly
resent
his
taking
the
step
and
in
regard
to
them
he
was
proud
where
louise
was
concerned
of
course
it
was
a
different
matter
there
no
misplaced
pride
should
stand
in
the
way
she
had
ample
means
for
her
own
needs
it
was
merely
a
question
of
earning
enough
to
keep
himself
the
sole
advantage
of
the
present
state
of
affairs
was
that
it
might
still
be
concealed
whereas
even
a
secret
marriage
implied
a
possible
publicity
it
might
somehow
leak
out
and
in
the
event
of
this
he
knew
that
his
parents
would
immediately
cut
off
supplies
if
once
he
were
independent
of
them
he
could
do
as
he
liked
he
set
his
teeth
at
the
thought
of
it
to
no
small
extent
his
way
was
mapped
out
for
him
marrying
louise
meant
giving
up
all
idea
of
returning
home
he
understood
now
more
clearly
than
before
how
unfitted
she
was
for
the
narrow
life
that
would
there
be
expected
of
her
and
even
if
he
had
longed
for
approval
and
consent
he
would
never
have
had
courage
to
ask
her
to
face
the
petty
ignoble
details
of
conventional
propriety
which
such
a
sanction
implied
no
if
he
wished
to
ensure
her
happiness
he
must
secure
to
her
the
freer
atmosphere
in
which
she
was
accustomed
to
live
he
must
burn
his
ships
behind
him
and
the
most
satisfactory
thing
was
that
he
was
able
to
do
it
without
a
pang
he
racked
his
brains
as
to
the
means
of
making
a
livelihood
there
was
nothing
he
would
not
do
he
was
more
ready
to
work
than
ever
a
labourer
with
a
starving
family
at
his
back
but
having
let
every
possibility
pass
before
his
mind
eye
he
was
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
occupation
open
to
him
was
the
one
he
had
come
to
leipzig
to
escape
he
was
fit
for
nothing
but
to
be
a
teacher
all
he
could
do
at
the
piano
hundreds
of
others
could
do
better
his
talents
as
a
conductor
were
he
had
learned
of
the
meagrest
the
pleasing
little
songs
he
might
compose
of
small
value
yet
if
this
were
the
price
he
had
to
pay
for
making
her
his
wife
he
was
content
to
pay
it
no
sacrifice
was
too
great
for
him
and
then
to
be
a
teacher
here
meant
something
different
from
what
it
meant
in
england
here
it
was
possible
to
retain
your
the
caste
of
the
class
was
another
to
begin
with
and
also
to
remain
in
touch
with
all
that
was
best
worth
knowing
as
a
foreigner
he
might
add
to
his
earnings
by
teaching
english
but
would
of
necessity
be
his
chief
source
of
income
they
were
plentiful
enough
avery
hill
supported
herself
entirely
by
them
and
furst
kept
his
family
of
course
though
this
was
due
to
schwarz
his
influence
was
a
key
to
all
doors
both
of
these
were
favourite
pupils
while
a
melancholy
fact
which
had
to
be
faced
was
that
he
did
not
stand
well
with
schwarz
somehow
they
had
never
taken
to
each
other
he
perhaps
had
had
too
open
an
eye
for
the
master
foibles
and
schwarz
had
no
doubt
been
aware
from
the
first
of
his
pupil
fatally
divided
interests
the
crown
had
probably
been
set
by
his
flight
in
july
if
he
wished
ultimately
to
achieve
something
the
interest
he
had
forfeited
must
be
regained
cost
what
it
might
he
would
work
in
these
coming
months
as
never
before
could
he
make
a
brilliant
even
a
wholly
respectable
job
of
the
trio
he
was
to
play
it
would
go
far
towards
reinstating
him
in
schwarz
good
graces
and
he
might
then
venture
to
approach
the
master
with
a
request
for
assistance
this
was
the
first
piece
of
work
that
lay
to
his
hand
and
he
would
do
it
with
all
his
might
after
that
the
rest
there
was
no
time
to
lose
a
mild
despair
overcame
him
at
the
thought
of
the
intricate
sonata
the
long
mazy
concerto
by
hummel
which
had
formed
his
holiday
task
in
exactly
a
fortnight
from
this
date
the
vacation
came
to
an
end
and
as
yet
he
did
not
know
a
note
of
them
through
the
motionless
heat
of
the
paved
streets
he
went
home
and
turning
frau
krause
out
of
his
room
sat
down
at
the
piano
to
scales
and
exercises
not
until
he
felt
suppleness
and
strength
coming
back
to
his
fingers
did
he
allow
his
thoughts
to
wander
then
however
they
leapt
to
louise
after
this
break
in
his
consciousness
he
seemed
to
have
been
absent
from
her
for
days
the
sun
was
full
on
her
windows
curtains
and
blinds
were
drawn
against
it
while
he
hesitated
still
dazzled
by
the
glare
of
the
streets
she
sprang
to
meet
him
laying
both
hands
on
his
shoulders
at
last
he
blinked
and
laughed
and
held
her
at
arm
length
at
last
why
what
does
that
mean
that
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
and
hoping
you
would
come
for
hours
but
dearest
i
too
early
as
it
is
it
not
six
yes
i
know
but
i
was
so
sure
you
would
come
sooner
that
you
would
be
able
to
stay
away
oh
the
afternoon
has
been
endless
and
the
heat
was
suffocating
i
could
dress
and
i
have
unpacked
a
thing
now
he
saw
that
she
was
in
her
and
that
the
bags
and
valises
stood
in
a
corner
just
as
they
had
been
carried
up
from
the
droschke
with
her
hands
still
on
his
shoulders
she
put
back
her
head
a
thin
line
of
white
appeared
between
her
lips
and
under
their
drooped
lids
her
eyes
shone
with
a
moist
brilliance
she
looked
at
him
eagerly
for
some
seconds
and
it
seemed
to
him
wistfully
too
then
in
an
inexplicable
change
of
mood
she
let
her
arms
fall
and
turned
away
she
had
grown
pale
and
despondent
there
was
only
one
thing
for
him
to
do
to
put
his
arms
round
her
and
draw
her
to
his
knee
holding
her
thus
he
whispered
in
her
ear
words
such
as
she
loved
to
hear
he
had
grown
skilled
in
repeating
them
under
the
even
murmur
of
his
voice
her
face
grew
tranquil
she
sank
little
by
little
into
a
state
of
her
one
fear
was
that
he
would
cease
speaking
on
the
a
clock
ticked
solemnly
its
minutes
went
by
unheeded
maurice
was
the
first
to
feel
the
disillusioning
shudder
of
reality
simultaneously
the
remembrance
returned
to
him
of
what
he
had
come
intending
to
tell
he
loosened
her
arms
louise
he
said
in
an
altered
voice
look
up
dear
and
let
me
see
your
eyes
you
wo
believe
me
i
think
but
i
came
this
evening
meaning
to
talk
very
sensibly
nothing
but
common
sense
in
fact
there
a
great
deal
i
want
to
say
to
you
come
let
us
be
two
rational
people
yes
as
a
beginning
i
draw
up
the
blinds
the
sun
behind
the
houses
now
and
the
room
is
so
close
louise
shrank
from
the
violent
dusty
light
and
her
face
a
moment
back
rapturously
content
took
on
at
once
a
look
of
apprehension
not
maurice
not
it
too
too
hot
for
common
sense
he
laughed
and
took
her
hand
be
my
own
brave
girl
and
help
me
you
have
only
to
look
at
me
as
you
know
to
make
me
forget
everything
and
that
must
be
we
have
got
to
be
serious
for
a
little
have
you
ever
thought
louise
how
seldom
you
and
i
have
talked
seriously
together
there
was
never
time
was
there
in
all
these
weeks
there
was
only
time
to
tell
you
how
much
you
are
to
but
now
well
so
many
things
were
running
in
my
head
this
afternoon
this
letter
from
home
was
the
beginning
of
them
read
it
this
page
here
at
least
and
then
tell
you
what
i
been
thinking
he
put
the
letter
into
her
hand
and
she
ran
her
eyes
over
the
page
but
she
laid
it
down
without
comment
a
fear
crossed
his
mind
do
misunderstand
it
he
said
hastily
you
know
that
point
was
settled
months
ago
there
no
question
of
going
back
for
me
now
and
i
glad
of
it
i
never
want
to
see
england
again
but
it
gave
me
a
lot
to
think
about
how
the
staying
here
was
to
be
managed
and
things
like
that
he
was
conscious
of
becoming
somewhat
wordy
and
as
she
did
not
respond
his
uneasiness
grew
in
his
anxiety
to
make
her
think
as
he
did
he
clasped
his
hand
over
hers
i
need
say
again
need
i
darling
what
the
past
weeks
have
meant
to
me
i
so
grateful
to
you
for
them
that
i
could
only
prove
it
with
years
of
my
life
but
and
do
misunderstand
this
either
or
think
i
do
love
you
more
now
than
ever
before
you
know
i
do
but
look
at
it
as
we
will
those
weeks
were
play
glorious
play
worth
half
existence
but
still
only
play
they
could
last
for
ever
now
come
back
and
we
have
to
face
work
and
the
workaday
world
you
see
what
i
mean
i
sure
there
was
a
note
of
entreaty
in
his
voice
as
she
still
kept
silence
he
gave
his
whole
strength
to
demolishing
the
mute
opposition
he
felt
in
her
from
now
on
dear
we
must
make
up
our
minds
to
be
two
very
sensible
people
i
an
enormous
amount
of
work
to
get
through
in
the
coming
months
and
at
easter
i
shall
probably
be
thrown
on
my
own
resources
but
i
fight
my
way
somehow
here
beside
you
we
live
our
own
life
just
you
and
let
me
tell
you
what
i
propose
to
do
and
here
he
laid
before
her
in
their
entirety
his
plans
for
winning
over
schwarz
for
gaining
a
foothold
and
for
making
a
modest
income
a
good
prufung
he
concluded
and
i
be
able
to
get
anything
i
want
out
of
him
in
the
meantime
i
got
to
make
a
decent
job
next
month
of
the
trio
i
pretty
well
in
his
black
books
i
can
guess
for
going
off
as
i
did
in
july
i
must
work
as
i
never
done
before
each
single
day
must
be
mapped
out
and
nothing
allowed
to
interfere
an
undertaking
but
you
help
me
wo
you
darling
as
only
you
can
i
let
things
go
far
too
much
i
see
it
now
but
it
was
impossible
frankly
i
did
care
i
only
wanted
you
now
it
will
it
must
be
different
the
unrest
is
gone
you
belong
to
me
and
i
to
you
we
are
sure
of
each
other
oh
it
stifling
there
no
air
in
the
room
she
rose
from
his
side
and
went
to
the
open
window
where
she
stood
with
her
back
to
him
as
a
result
of
his
words
her
life
seemed
suddenly
to
stretch
before
her
just
as
dry
and
dusty
and
commonplace
as
the
street
she
looked
down
on
i
want
to
show
you
too
he
continued
behind
her
that
you
utterly
thrown
yourself
away
i
know
how
little
i
can
do
but
honest
endeavour
must
count
for
something
i
ask
nothing
better
than
to
work
for
you
louise
and
you
know
it
a
wave
of
warm
air
came
in
at
the
window
the
dying
afternoon
turned
to
twilight
yes
and
i
what
am
i
to
do
what
room
is
there
for
me
in
your
plans
of
work
he
glanced
sharply
at
her
but
she
had
not
moved
louise
dearest
i
know
that
what
i
say
must
sound
selfish
and
inconsiderate
and
yet
i
ca
help
it
i
forced
to
ask
you
to
wait
merely
to
wait
and
for
what
good
heavens
no
one
realises
it
as
i
do
i
have
nothing
to
offer
you
in
return
but
my
love
for
you
but
if
you
knew
how
strong
that
is
if
you
knew
how
happy
i
am
resolved
to
make
you
have
a
little
patience
darling
it
will
all
come
right
in
the
end
if
only
you
love
me
and
you
do
do
you
say
once
more
you
do
she
turned
so
swiftly
that
the
tail
of
her
twisted
and
fell
over
on
itself
can
you
still
ask
that
have
you
not
had
proof
enough
is
there
an
inch
of
you
that
does
believe
in
my
love
for
you
oh
maurice
it
only
that
i
tired
and
restless
i
was
so
wretched
at
having
to
come
back
and
the
heat
has
got
on
my
nerves
i
wish
a
great
storm
would
come
and
shake
the
house
and
make
the
branches
of
the
trees
beat
against
the
panes
do
you
remember
and
we
were
so
safe
the
worse
the
storm
was
the
closer
you
held
me
she
sat
down
beside
him
on
the
arm
of
the
sofa
such
a
night
seemed
doubly
wild
after
the
long
still
days
that
had
gone
before
it
do
you
remember
oh
why
had
it
all
to
end
were
we
happy
enough
or
did
we
ask
too
much
why
must
time
go
just
the
same
over
happiness
and
unhappiness
alike
she
got
up
again
and
strayed
back
to
the
window
days
like
those
will
never
can
never
come
again
even
as
it
is
coming
back
has
made
a
difference
could
you
even
yesterday
have
spoken
as
you
do
was
there
any
room
then
for
common
sense
between
us
no
we
were
too
happy
it
was
enough
to
know
we
were
alive
be
reasonable
darling
i
am
as
sorry
as
you
that
these
weeks
are
over
but
glorious
as
they
were
they
could
last
for
ever
and
trust
me
we
shall
know
other
days
just
as
but
if
because
i
talk
like
this
you
imagine
i
do
love
you
a
hundred
times
better
even
than
yesterday
but
you
do
mean
that
you
know
me
better
my
rachel
yes
perhaps
you
right
you
are
right
but
i
am
right
too
she
came
back
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
again
and
propped
her
chin
on
her
hand
you
tired
dear
that
all
things
will
look
different
and
you
see
the
truth
of
what
i
say
at
night
things
get
distorted
no
no
one
only
really
sees
in
the
dark
she
interrupted
him
but
in
the
morning
one
can
smile
at
one
fears
trust
me
louise
and
believe
in
me
all
our
future
happiness
depends
on
how
we
act
just
now
our
future
happiness
yes
she
said
slowly
but
what
of
the
present
is
it
worth
while
sacrificing
a
brief
present
to
a
long
future
she
threw
him
a
quick
glance
you
talk
like
an
orthodox
christian
maurice
she
said
and
added
the
present
is
here
it
belongs
to
us
the
future
is
so
unclear
who
knows
what
it
will
bring
us
and
is
it
just
for
that
very
reason
that
i
speak
as
i
do
if
everything
lay
clear
and
straight
before
us
do
you
think
i
should
bother
about
anything
but
you
it
the
uncertainty
of
the
whole
thing
that
troubles
me
but
however
vague
it
is
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
that
will
happen
and
you
know
dearest
what
that
is
the
only
ambition
i
have
left
to
make
you
my
wife
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
she
gazed
at
him
meditatively
why
would
you
let
me
have
my
way
at
first
he
cried
why
were
you
against
it
we
could
have
kept
it
a
secret
no
one
need
have
known
a
thing
about
it
and
i
should
never
have
asked
you
to
go
to
england
or
to
see
my
people
call
it
narrow
if
you
must
i
ca
help
it
the
only
thing
for
us
to
do
why
wo
you
agree
tell
me
what
you
have
against
it
listen
he
knelt
down
and
put
his
arms
round
her
we
have
still
a
fortnight
that
time
enough
let
us
go
to
england
and
be
married
without
a
word
to
anyone
in
the
first
office
we
find
only
marry
me
would
it
make
you
love
me
more
she
looked
at
him
intently
turning
the
whole
weight
of
her
dark
glance
upon
him
you
he
said
you
to
ask
such
a
thing
you
with
these
eyes
and
this
hair
and
these
hands
i
love
every
line
of
them
you
understand
can
you
you
bundle
of
emotions
that
i
should
care
for
you
as
i
do
and
yet
be
able
to
talk
soberly
it
seems
to
you
a
man
way
of
loving
and
poor
at
that
but
if
you
imagine
i
do
love
you
all
the
more
for
what
you
have
sacrificed
for
me
no
you
did
say
that
i
know
but
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
in
the
end
she
made
no
answer
and
a
feeling
of
discouragement
began
to
creep
over
him
he
rose
to
his
feet
a
man
who
loves
a
woman
as
i
love
you
he
said
almost
violently
has
only
one
wish
can
have
only
one
i
shall
never
rest
or
be
thoroughly
happy
till
you
consent
to
marry
me
that
you
can
refuse
as
you
do
seems
to
prove
that
you
do
care
for
me
enough
she
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
her
wide
sleeves
fell
back
leaving
her
arms
bear
maurice
she
said
gently
why
must
you
worry
yourself
you
know
if
you
are
set
on
our
marrying
i
give
way
but
i
do
want
to
be
married
not
yet
there
plenty
of
time
it
only
a
small
matter
now
it
does
seem
as
if
it
could
make
any
difference
and
yet
it
might
the
sense
of
being
bound
of
some
one
no
of
the
law
permitting
us
to
love
each
other
no
maurice
not
listen
older
and
wiser
than
you
and
i
know
happiness
like
this
does
come
every
day
instead
of
brooding
and
hesitating
one
must
seize
it
while
it
there
it
such
a
slippery
thing
it
gone
before
you
know
it
you
ca
bind
it
fast
and
say
it
shall
last
so
and
so
long
we
have
it
now
do
let
us
talk
and
reason
about
oh
nervous
let
me
make
a
confession
as
a
child
i
had
presentiments
things
i
foresaw
came
true
and
on
the
morning
of
a
misfortune
i
felt
such
a
load
on
my
chest
that
i
could
hardly
breathe
well
when
i
came
into
this
room
again
it
seemed
as
if
two
black
wings
shut
out
the
sunlight
and
i
was
afraid
the
past
weeks
have
been
so
unreasonably
happy
such
happiness
must
be
let
go
help
me
to
hold
it
i
ca
do
it
alone
do
try
to
make
it
fast
to
the
future
while
you
do
that
it
going
do
you
think
one
can
draw
out
happiness
like
a
thread
oh
help
me
do
let
any
thing
take
it
from
us
and
i
will
give
up
everything
to
it
only
you
must
always
be
beside
me
maurice
and
love
me
do
let
anything
come
between
us
for
my
sake
for
my
sake
in
the
face
of
this
outpouring
his
own
opinions
seemed
of
little
matter
his
one
concern
was
to
ward
off
the
tears
that
he
saw
were
imminent
he
held
her
to
him
stroked
her
hair
and
murmured
words
of
comfort
but
when
she
raised
her
head
again
her
eyelids
were
reddened
as
though
she
had
actually
wept
now
i
know
you
now
you
are
my
own
again
she
whispered
how
could
i
know
you
as
you
were
then
i
never
seen
you
like
that
seen
you
cold
and
sensible
he
looked
down
at
her
without
speaking
in
a
preoccupied
way
she
touched
his
face
with
her
finger
here
are
lines
i
do
know
i
see
them
now
for
the
first
time
lines
of
reason
of
common
sense
of
all
that
is
strange
to
me
in
you
he
caught
her
hand
continuing
to
gaze
at
her
with
the
same
expression
of
aloofness
i
need
them
for
us
both
you
have
none
her
lips
parted
in
a
smile
then
this
faded
and
she
looked
at
him
with
eyes
that
reminded
him
of
an
untamed
animal
or
of
a
startled
child
mine
still
mine
she
said
and
in
the
hours
it
took
to
reassure
her
his
primly
reasoned
conclusions
were
blown
like
chaff
before
the
wind
ii
the
next
fortnight
flew
by
and
familiar
faces
began
to
appear
again
the
steps
and
inner
vestibule
of
the
conservatorium
became
a
lounge
for
seeing
acquaintances
in
the
cafe
at
the
corner
the
click
of
billiard
balls
was
to
be
heard
from
early
morning
on
maurice
looked
forward
to
meeting
his
friends
with
some
embarrassment
it
was
unlikely
that
the
events
of
the
summer
had
remained
a
secret
for
that
there
was
a
clique
in
the
place
on
the
alert
for
scandal
to
which
unfortunately
the
name
of
louise
dufrayer
lent
itself
only
too
readily
he
could
not
decide
what
position
to
take
up
with
regard
to
their
present
intimacy
to
flaunt
it
openly
to
be
pointed
at
as
her
lover
would
for
her
sake
be
repugnant
to
him
it
made
him
reject
an
idea
he
had
revolved
of
begging
her
to
let
him
announce
their
engagement
for
in
the
present
state
of
things
the
word
brautigam
had
an
evil
sound
eventually
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
they
must
be
more
cautious
than
they
had
ever
been
and
give
absolutely
no
food
for
talk
one
day
in
the
grassistrasse
he
came
upon
a
little
knot
of
men
he
knew
and
it
was
just
as
he
supposed
the
secret
was
a
secret
no
longer
he
saw
it
at
once
in
their
treatment
of
him
there
was
a
spice
of
deference
in
their
manner
and
their
looks
expressed
curiosity
envious
surprise
even
a
kind
of
brotherly
welcome
after
this
maurice
changed
his
mind
the
only
course
open
to
him
was
to
brazen
things
out
he
would
not
wait
for
his
friends
to
show
him
what
they
thought
he
would
be
beforehand
with
them
a
chance
soon
offered
of
putting
his
intentions
into
practice
on
entering
seyffert
one
afternoon
he
espied
dove
who
had
just
returned
dove
sat
alone
at
a
small
table
reading
the
tageblatt
before
him
stood
a
cup
of
cocoa
when
he
saw
maurice
he
raised
the
newspaper
a
trifle
higher
so
that
it
covered
the
level
of
his
eyes
but
maurice
went
across
the
room
and
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
dove
dropped
his
shield
and
sprang
up
exclaiming
with
surprise
maurice
sat
down
beside
him
and
by
dint
of
a
little
wheedling
put
dove
at
his
ease
the
latter
was
bubbling
over
with
new
experiences
and
future
prospects
it
seemed
that
in
peterborough
dove
native
town
the
art
of
music
was
taking
strides
that
were
nothing
short
of
marvellous
to
hear
dove
talk
the
palm
for
progress
must
be
awarded
to
peterborough
over
and
above
all
the
other
towns
of
great
britain
and
he
was
agog
with
plans
and
expectations
during
the
holidays
he
had
held
conversations
with
several
local
magnates
all
of
whom
expressed
themselves
in
favour
of
his
scheme
for
founding
a
school
of
music
and
promised
him
their
support
dove
had
returned
to
leipzig
in
a
outfit
and
a
hard
hat
his
studies
were
coming
to
an
end
in
spring
and
he
began
to
think
already
of
casting
the
skin
of
bohemianism
maurice
listened
to
him
leniently
even
drew
dove
out
a
little
but
he
kept
his
eye
on
the
clock
in
less
than
half
an
hour
he
would
be
with
louise
from
some
corner
of
the
semidarkened
room
she
would
spring
towards
him
and
throw
herself
into
his
arms
the
majority
of
the
classes
were
not
yet
assembled
when
one
day
a
rumour
rose
and
spreading
ran
from
mouth
to
mouth
those
who
heard
it
were
at
first
incredulous
as
however
it
continued
to
make
headway
they
whistled
to
themselves
or
vented
their
surprise
in
a
breathless
ach
later
in
the
day
they
stood
about
in
groups
and
excitedly
discussed
the
subject
ten
of
schwarz
most
advanced
pupils
had
left
the
master
for
the
outsider
named
schrievers
at
the
head
of
the
list
stood
furst
the
conservatorium
royally
endowed
and
municipally
controlled
held
to
its
customs
with
tenacity
the
older
masters
laboured
to
uphold
tradition
and
such
younger
ones
as
were
progressively
inclined
had
not
the
influence
to
effect
a
change
unattached
teachers
were
regarded
with
suspicion
unless
they
happened
to
be
former
pupils
of
the
institution
in
which
case
it
was
assumed
that
they
carried
out
its
precepts
there
had
naturally
always
been
plenty
of
others
as
well
but
these
were
comparatively
powerless
they
could
give
their
pupils
neither
imposing
certificates
nor
gala
public
performances
such
as
the
prufungen
and
for
the
most
part
they
flourished
unknown
this
was
previous
to
the
arrival
of
schrievers
it
was
now
about
a
year
and
a
half
ago
that
his
settling
in
leipzig
had
caused
a
flutter
in
musical
circles
then
however
he
had
been
forgotten
or
at
least
remembered
only
at
intervals
when
it
was
heard
that
he
had
caught
another
fish
in
the
shape
of
a
renegade
pupil
schrievers
was
a
burly
man
still
well
under
middle
age
and
possessed
of
plenty
of
push
and
it
soon
transpired
that
he
was
an
champion
of
modern
ideas
in
music
for
from
the
first
he
was
connected
with
a
leading
paper
in
which
he
made
his
views
known
he
had
a
trenchant
pen
and
with
unfailing
consistency
criticised
the
musical
conditions
of
leipzig
adversely
the
progressive
lisztverein
of
which
he
was
soon
the
leading
spirit
alone
escaped
the
opera
bereft
of
nikisch
and
the
gewandhaus
under
its
gentle
and
aged
conductor
were
treated
by
him
with
biting
sarcasm
but
his
chief
butt
was
the
conservatorium
and
its
ancient
methods
he
asserted
that
not
a
jot
of
the
curriculum
had
been
altered
for
fifty
years
and
its
speedy
downfall
was
the
sole
result
to
be
expected
and
hoped
for
the
fact
that
at
this
time
some
seven
hundred
odd
students
were
enrolled
on
its
books
went
far
to
discredit
this
pious
hope
but
nevertheless
schrievers
harped
always
on
the
same
string
and
just
as
perpetual
dropping
wears
a
stone
so
his
continued
diatribes
ate
into
emotional
and
sensitive
natures
he
began
to
attract
a
following
and
simultaneously
to
make
himself
known
as
a
pupil
of
liszt
this
brought
him
a
fresh
batch
of
enemies
even
a
small
german
town
is
seldom
without
its
and
in
leipzig
several
were
settled
none
of
whom
had
ever
heard
of
martin
schrievers
they
refused
to
admit
him
to
their
jealous
clique
in
their
opinion
he
belonged
to
that
goodly
class
of
persons
who
having
by
hook
or
by
crook
contrived
to
spend
an
hour
in
the
abbe
of
weimar
presence
afterwards
abused
the
sacred
narre
of
pupil
he
was
hated
by
these
chosen
few
with
more
vigour
than
by
the
conservative
pedagogues
who
naturally
enough
saw
the
ruin
of
art
in
all
he
did
various
reasons
were
given
for
his
success
no
one
being
willing
to
believe
that
it
was
due
to
his
merits
as
a
teacher
some
said
that
he
recognised
in
a
twinkling
the
weak
points
of
the
individual
with
whom
he
had
to
deal
he
humoured
foibles
was
tender
of
he
also
flattered
his
pupils
by
giving
them
music
that
was
beyond
their
powers
of
execution
those
for
instance
who
had
worked
long
and
with
feeble
interest
at
czerny
dussek
and
hummel
were
dazzled
at
the
prospect
of
liszt
and
chopin
which
was
suddenly
thrust
beneath
their
eyes
other
believed
that
his
chief
bait
was
the
musical
soirees
he
gave
when
a
famous
pianist
came
to
the
town
by
virtue
of
his
journalistic
position
he
was
personally
acquainted
with
all
the
great
they
visited
at
his
house
and
his
pupils
had
thus
not
merely
the
opportunity
of
getting
to
know
artists
like
rubinstein
and
and
of
hearing
them
play
in
private
but
what
was
more
to
the
point
of
themselves
taking
part
in
the
performance
and
perhaps
receiving
a
golden
word
from
the
great
man
lips
and
though
no
huge
parchment
scroll
was
forthcoming
on
the
termination
of
one
studies
yet
schrievers
held
the
weapon
of
criticism
in
his
hand
and
at
the
first
tentative
public
appearance
of
the
young
performer
could
make
or
mar
as
he
chose
he
lived
on
good
terms
too
with
his
so
that
was
easy
incomparably
more
so
than
were
the
embarrassing
visits
open
to
any
snub
which
were
common
if
one
was
only
a
pupil
of
the
conservatorium
and
which
in
the
case
of
the
ladypupils
included
costly
bouquets
of
flowers
among
those
who
had
deserted
schwarz
were
some
like
miss
martin
malcontents
who
had
flitted
from
place
to
place
and
from
master
to
master
in
the
perpetual
hope
of
discovering
that
ideal
teacher
who
would
estimate
them
at
their
true
worth
these
were
radiantly
satisfied
with
the
change
miss
martin
bore
wherever
she
went
an
by
liszt
and
flaunted
it
in
the
faces
of
her
friends
and
miss
moses
who
had
been
under
bendel
could
not
say
two
sentences
without
throwing
in
that
chopin
etude
i
studied
last
or
the
polonaise
in
e
flat
i
working
at
for
beforehand
she
too
had
been
a
humble
performer
of
haydn
and
bertini
james
had
the
prospect
of
playing
a
concerto
by
liszt
forbidden
fruit
to
the
pupils
of
the
conservatorium
in
one
of
the
concerts
of
the
lisztverein
and
was
sure
in
advance
of
being
favourably
criticised
boehmer
wished
to
specialise
in
bach
and
if
schwarz
set
himself
against
one
thing
more
than
another
it
was
a
musical
taste
within
the
bounds
of
classicism
the
master
demanded
catholic
sympathies
those
students
who
had
romantic
leanings
towards
chopin
and
schumann
were
castigated
with
severely
classical
compositions
and
vice
versa
he
had
insisted
on
boehmer
widening
his
horizon
on
schubert
and
mendelssohn
and
there
were
also
several
others
who
having
been
dragged
forward
by
schwarz
from
inefficient
beginnings
now
left
him
to
write
their
acquired
skill
to
credit
furst
was
the
greatest
riddle
of
all
it
was
he
who
on
subsequent
was
to
have
extended
the
fame
of
the
conservatorium
he
was
the
show
pupil
of
the
institution
and
in
the
coming
prufungen
was
to
have
distinguished
himself
and
his
master
with
him
by
playing
beethoven
concerto
in
e
flat
other
teachers
besides
schwarz
had
been
forsaken
for
the
but
in
no
case
by
so
large
a
body
of
students
they
bore
their
losses
philosophically
bendel
one
of
the
few
masters
who
spoke
english
it
was
against
the
principles
of
schwarz
to
know
a
word
of
it
foreign
pupils
had
to
learn
his
language
not
he
theirs
bendel
frequented
chiefly
by
the
american
colony
was
of
a
phlegmatic
temperament
and
not
easily
roused
he
alluded
to
the
backsliders
with
an
ironical
jest
preferring
to
believe
that
they
were
the
losers
but
schwarz
was
of
a
diametrically
opposite
nature
in
the
short
thickset
man
with
the
eyes
and
the
head
of
carefully
waved
hair
just
streaked
with
grey
a
head
at
once
too
massive
and
too
fine
for
the
clumsy
body
in
schwarz
dwelt
a
fierce
and
indomitable
pride
his
was
one
of
those
moody
sensitive
natures
quick
to
resent
always
on
the
for
offence
he
was
ever
ready
to
translate
things
into
the
personal
for
though
he
had
an
overweening
sense
of
his
own
importance
there
was
yet
room
in
him
for
a
secret
doubt
and
with
this
doubt
he
as
it
were
put
other
people
to
the
test
the
loss
of
the
flower
of
his
flock
made
him
doubly
unsure
he
felt
himself
a
marked
man
for
bendel
and
other
enemies
to
jeer
at
aloud
he
spoke
long
and
vehemently
as
if
mere
noisy
words
would
heal
the
wound
and
the
pupils
who
had
remained
faithful
to
him
gathered
all
the
more
closely
round
him
and
burned
as
he
did
if
wishes
could
have
injured
or
killed
furst
career
would
then
and
there
have
come
to
an
end
his
ingratitude
his
treachery
and
his
lack
of
moral
fibre
were
denounced
on
every
hand
one
day
at
this
time
maurice
entered
schwarz
room
the
class
was
assembled
but
although
the
hour
was
well
advanced
no
one
had
begun
to
play
the
master
stood
at
the
window
with
his
back
to
the
courtyard
he
was
haranguing
in
a
strident
voice
the
three
pupils
who
sat
along
the
wall
from
what
followed
maurice
gathered
that
that
very
afternoon
schwarz
had
been
informed
of
the
loss
of
four
more
pupils
and
though
as
every
one
knew
he
had
hitherto
not
set
much
store
by
any
of
them
he
now
discovered
latent
talent
in
all
four
and
was
at
the
same
time
exasperated
that
such
nonentities
should
presume
to
judge
him
to
infer
from
the
appearance
of
those
present
the
storm
had
raged
fora
considerable
period
and
still
it
went
on
after
the
expiry
of
a
further
interval
krafft
who
throughout
had
sat
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
woke
as
though
from
sleep
yawned
heartily
stretched
himself
and
taking
out
his
watch
studied
it
with
profound
attention
for
the
first
time
schwarz
was
checked
in
his
flow
of
words
he
coughed
fumbled
for
an
epithet
then
stopped
and
to
the
general
surprise
motioned
krafft
to
the
piano
but
heinrich
was
in
a
bad
mood
he
stifled
another
yawn
before
beginning
and
played
in
a
mechanical
way
schwarz
had
often
enough
made
allowance
for
this
pupil
varying
moods
he
was
not
now
in
the
humour
to
do
so
halt
he
cried
before
the
first
page
was
turned
what
in
god
name
is
the
meaning
of
this
do
you
come
here
to
read
from
sight
krafft
continued
to
play
as
if
nothing
had
been
said
do
you
hear
me
thundered
schwarz
it
impossible
said
krafft
and
proceeded
barmherziger
gott
the
master
short
neck
reddened
and
twisted
in
its
collar
give
me
music
i
care
to
play
and
i
show
you
how
it
should
be
done
i
can
make
nothing
of
this
answered
krafft
schwarz
strode
up
to
the
piano
and
swept
the
volume
from
the
rack
it
fell
with
a
crash
on
the
keys
and
on
krafft
hands
and
effectually
hindered
him
from
continuing
what
had
gone
before
was
as
a
summer
shower
to
a
deluge
with
his
arms
stiffly
knotted
behind
his
back
schwarz
paced
the
floor
with
a
tread
that
shook
it
his
steely
blue
eyes
flashed
with
passion
the
veins
stood
out
on
his
forehead
his
large
prominent
mouth
gaped
above
his
tuft
of
beard
he
struck
ludicrous
attitudes
pouring
out
meanwhile
without
stint
for
he
had
soon
passed
from
krafft
particular
case
of
insubordination
to
the
general
one
pouring
out
the
savage
anger
and
injury
that
had
accumulated
in
him
finally
he
invited
the
class
to
rise
and
leave
him
there
and
then
for
what
in
god
name
were
they
waiting
let
them
up
and
away
without
more
ado
on
receiving
the
volume
of
beethoven
on
his
fingers
krafft
straightened
out
the
pages
and
taking
down
his
hat
from
its
peg
left
the
room
with
movements
of
a
calculated
coolness
but
only
a
pupil
of
bullow
might
take
such
a
liberty
the
rest
had
to
assist
quietly
at
the
painful
scene
maurice
studied
his
finger
nails
and
dove
did
not
once
remove
his
eyes
from
the
leg
of
the
piano
they
at
least
knew
from
experience
that
in
time
the
storm
would
pass
also
that
it
sounded
worse
than
it
actually
was
but
a
a
stout
bavarian
lad
with
hair
cut
like
rubinstein
who
was
present
at
the
lesson
for
the
first
time
was
pale
and
frightened
and
sat
drinking
in
every
word
towards
the
end
of
the
hour
when
quiet
was
inclination
was
rather
to
escape
from
the
room
and
be
free
than
to
sit
down
to
play
something
that
demanded
coolness
and
concentration
dove
who
was
not
sensitive
to
externals
came
safely
through
the
ordeal
but
maurice
made
a
poor
job
of
the
trio
in
which
he
had
hoped
to
excel
schwarz
did
not
even
offer
to
turn
the
pages
this
beyerlein
the
did
in
a
nervous
desire
to
ingratiate
himself
but
he
was
still
so
flustered
that
at
a
critical
moment
he
brought
the
music
down
on
the
keys
schwarz
said
nothing
wrapped
in
the
moody
silence
that
invariably
followed
his
outbursts
he
hardly
seemed
aware
that
anyone
was
playing
after
two
movements
of
the
trio
he
signed
to
beyerlein
to
take
his
turn
and
proffered
no
comment
on
maurice
work
maurice
would
have
hurried
away
without
a
further
word
had
he
not
already
learned
the
early
date
of
his
performance
he
knew
too
that
if
the
practical
side
of
the
affair
rehearsals
with
string
players
and
so
on
was
not
satisfactorily
arranged
he
would
be
blamed
for
it
so
he
reminded
schwarz
of
the
matter
from
what
ensued
it
was
plain
that
the
master
still
bore
him
a
grudge
for
absconding
in
summer
schwarz
glared
coldly
at
him
as
if
unsure
to
what
maurice
alluded
and
when
the
latter
had
recalled
the
details
of
the
case
to
his
mind
he
said
rudely
you
went
your
way
herr
guest
now
i
go
mine
he
commenced
to
turn
the
leaves
of
his
ponderous
and
after
maurice
had
stood
for
some
few
minutes
listening
to
beyerlein
trip
and
stumble
through
mozart
he
felt
that
for
this
day
at
least
he
could
put
up
with
no
more
and
left
the
class
iii
shaking
all
disagreeable
impressions
from
him
he
sped
through
the
fading
light
of
the
september
afternoon
this
was
the
time
it
was
six
at
which
he
could
rejoin
louise
with
a
free
mind
it
was
the
exception
for
him
to
go
earlier
or
at
other
hours
but
did
he
chance
to
go
no
matter
when
she
met
him
in
the
same
way
sprang
towards
him
from
the
window
where
she
had
been
sitting
or
standing
with
her
eyes
on
the
street
i
believe
you
watch
for
me
all
day
long
he
said
to
her
once
on
this
particular
afternoon
when
he
had
used
much
the
same
words
to
her
she
put
back
her
head
and
looked
up
at
him
with
a
pale
unsmiling
face
not
quite
she
answered
slowly
but
i
have
a
fancy
maurice
a
foolish
fancy
that
once
you
will
come
early
in
the
morning
and
we
shall
have
the
whole
day
together
again
perhaps
even
go
away
somewhere
before
summer
is
quite
over
and
i
promise
you
dearest
we
will
just
let
me
get
through
the
next
fortnight
and
then
i
shall
be
freer
we
take
the
train
and
go
back
to
rochlitz
or
anywhere
you
like
in
the
meantime
take
more
care
of
yourself
you
are
far
too
pale
you
will
go
out
tomorrow
yes
to
please
me
but
this
was
a
request
he
had
often
made
and
generally
in
vain
since
the
afternoon
of
their
return
louise
had
made
no
further
attempt
to
stem
or
alter
circumstance
she
accepted
maurice
absences
without
demur
but
one
result
was
that
her
feelings
were
hoarded
up
for
the
few
hours
he
passed
with
her
these
were
then
a
of
emotion
and
it
seemed
impossible
to
cram
enough
into
them
to
make
good
the
starved
remainder
of
the
day
maurice
was
vaguely
troubled
he
was
himself
so
busy
at
this
time
and
so
full
of
revived
energy
that
he
could
not
imagine
her
happy
living
as
she
did
entirely
without
occupation
at
first
he
had
tried
to
persuade
her
to
take
up
her
music
again
but
she
would
not
even
consider
it
to
all
his
arguments
she
made
the
same
reply
i
have
no
real
talent
with
me
it
was
only
an
excuse
to
get
away
from
home
nor
could
he
induce
her
to
renew
her
acquaintance
with
people
she
had
known
do
you
know
i
once
thought
you
did
care
a
jot
what
people
said
of
you
it
was
not
a
very
kind
thing
to
say
it
slipped
out
unawares
but
she
did
not
take
it
amiss
i
used
not
to
she
answered
with
her
invincible
frankness
but
now
it
seems
i
do
why
dearest
are
you
happy
enough
not
to
care
for
answer
she
took
his
face
between
her
hands
and
looked
at
him
with
such
an
fire
in
her
eyes
that
all
he
could
do
was
to
draw
her
into
his
arms
his
pains
for
her
good
came
to
nothing
he
took
her
his
favourite
books
but
with
the
exception
of
an
occasional
novel
louise
was
no
reader
in
those
he
brought
her
she
seldom
advanced
further
than
the
first
few
pages
and
she
could
sit
for
an
hour
without
turning
a
leaf
he
had
never
seen
her
with
a
piece
of
sewing
or
any
such
feminine
employment
in
her
hands
nor
did
she
spend
time
on
her
person
as
a
rule
he
found
her
in
her
he
had
to
give
up
trying
to
influence
her
and
to
become
reconciled
to
the
fact
that
she
chose
to
live
only
for
him
but
on
this
september
day
after
the
unpleasant
episode
with
schwarz
he
had
a
fancy
to
go
for
a
walk
louise
was
unwilling
and
he
felt
anew
how
preposterous
it
was
for
her
to
spend
these
fine
autumn
days
in
this
room
you
are
burying
yourself
alive
just
as
you
did
last
winter
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
lips
no
no
do
say
that
now
i
am
happy
but
are
you
really
sometimes
i
not
sure
he
was
tired
himself
this
evening
and
found
it
difficult
to
be
convinced
it
troubles
me
when
i
think
how
dull
it
must
be
for
you
dearest
are
you
can
you
really
be
happy
like
this
i
have
you
maurice
but
only
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
tell
me
what
do
you
think
of
of
you
all
that
time
of
poor
plain
ordinary
me
you
are
mine
she
said
with
vehemence
and
looked
at
him
with
what
he
called
her
eyes
you
would
like
to
eat
me
i
think
yes
and
i
should
begin
here
this
is
the
bit
of
you
i
love
best
and
before
he
knew
what
she
was
going
to
do
she
had
stooped
and
he
felt
her
teeth
in
the
skin
of
his
neck
that
a
strange
way
of
showing
your
love
he
said
and
involuntarily
put
his
hand
to
the
spot
where
two
marks
had
appeared
it
my
way
i
want
you
i
want
you
i
want
to
feel
that
mine
to
make
you
more
mine
than
you
ever
been
i
wish
i
had
a
hundred
arms
i
would
hold
you
with
them
all
and
never
let
you
go
but
dearest
one
would
think
i
wanted
to
go
do
you
really
believe
if
i
had
my
own
way
i
should
be
anywhere
but
here
with
you
i
do
how
should
i
know
doubts
beloved
no
no
not
doubts
it
only
oh
i
do
know
what
it
is
if
you
could
always
be
with
me
maurice
they
would
come
for
what
i
never
meant
to
happen
has
happened
i
have
grown
to
care
too
much
far
too
much
i
want
you
i
need
you
at
every
moment
of
the
day
i
want
you
never
to
be
out
of
my
sight
maurice
held
her
at
arm
length
and
looked
at
her
you
can
say
that
at
last
and
drawing
her
to
him
patience
darling
just
a
little
patience
some
day
you
will
never
be
alone
again
i
do
have
patience
maurice
but
let
me
be
patient
in
my
own
way
for
i
not
like
you
i
have
no
room
in
me
now
for
other
things
i
think
of
anything
else
if
i
had
my
way
we
should
shut
ourselves
up
alone
and
live
only
for
each
other
not
share
it
not
make
it
just
a
part
of
what
we
do
but
man
ca
live
on
nectar
and
honey
alone
it
would
be
life
it
would
be
life
no
it
would
be
more
than
life
some
of
the
evening
shadows
seemed
to
invade
her
face
her
expression
was
childishly
pathetic
he
drew
her
to
his
knee
i
should
like
to
see
you
happier
louise
yes
yes
i
know
but
i
mean
perfectly
happy
as
you
were
sometimes
at
rochlitz
since
we
came
back
it
has
never
been
just
the
right
thing
say
what
you
like
if
only
we
had
never
come
back
if
you
still
think
so
darling
when
i
finished
here
we
go
away
at
once
in
the
meantime
patience
oh
i
do
mean
to
be
unreasonable
but
her
head
was
on
his
shoulder
his
arms
were
round
her
and
in
this
position
nothing
mattered
greatly
to
her
patience
yes
there
was
need
for
him
to
exhort
her
to
patience
it
ate
already
into
her
soul
as
iron
bands
eat
into
flesh
the
greater
part
of
her
life
was
now
spent
in
practising
it
and
for
sheer
loathing
of
it
she
turned
over
on
waking
and
kept
her
eyes
closed
in
an
attempt
to
prolong
the
night
for
the
day
stretched
empty
before
her
the
hours
passed
one
by
one
like
ghosts
yet
not
for
a
moment
had
she
harboured
his
idea
of
regular
occupation
she
knew
herself
too
well
for
that
in
the
fever
into
which
her
blood
had
worked
itself
she
could
settle
to
nothing
her
attention
was
centred
wholly
in
herself
and
all
her
senses
were
preternaturally
acute
but
she
suffered
too
under
the
stress
of
her
feeling
it
blunted
her
and
made
her
on
the
one
hand
regardless
of
everything
outside
it
on
the
other
morbidly
sensitive
to
trifles
she
waited
for
him
hour
after
hour
crouched
in
a
corner
of
the
sofa
or
stretched
at
full
length
with
closed
eyes
long
before
it
was
time
for
him
to
come
she
was
stationed
at
the
window
she
learned
to
know
the
people
who
appeared
in
the
street
between
the
hours
of
four
and
six
so
accurately
that
she
could
have
described
them
blindfold
there
was
the
oldfaced
little
girl
who
delivered
milk
there
was
the
postman
who
emptied
into
his
canvas
receptacle
the
blue
affixed
to
the
opposite
wall
the
student
with
the
gashed
face
and
red
cap
who
lived
a
couple
of
doors
further
down
and
always
whistled
the
same
tune
the
big
newfoundland
dog
that
stalked
majestically
at
his
side
and
answered
to
the
name
of
tasso
she
knew
them
all
these
two
last
hours
were
weighted
with
lead
he
came
sometimes
a
poor
too
soon
but
usually
not
till
past
six
never
in
her
life
had
she
waited
for
anyone
like
this
and
towards
the
end
of
the
time
a
sense
of
injury
of
more
than
mortal
endurance
would
steal
through
her
and
dull
her
heart
towards
him
in
a
way
that
frightened
her
when
at
length
she
saw
him
turn
the
corner
when
she
had
caught
and
answered
his
swift
upward
glance
she
drew
back
into
the
shadow
of
the
room
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
then
she
listened
he
had
the
key
of
the
little
papered
door
in
the
wall
between
the
sound
of
his
step
on
the
stair
and
the
turning
of
the
key
in
the
lock
there
was
time
for
her
to
undergo
a
moment
of
suspense
that
drove
her
hand
to
her
throat
what
if
after
the
tension
of
the
afternoon
her
heart
her
nerves
parts
of
her
over
which
she
had
no
control
should
not
take
their
customary
bound
towards
him
what
if
her
pulses
should
not
answer
his
but
before
she
could
think
her
thought
to
the
end
he
was
there
and
when
she
saw
his
kind
eyes
alight
his
eager
hands
outstretched
her
nervous
fears
were
vanquished
maurice
hardly
gave
himself
time
to
shut
the
door
before
catching
her
to
him
in
a
long
embrace
and
yet
though
she
did
not
suspect
it
he
too
had
a
twinge
of
uncertainty
on
entering
her
bodily
presence
still
affected
him
with
a
sense
of
strangeness
it
took
him
a
moment
to
get
used
to
her
again
as
it
were
and
he
was
forced
to
reassure
himself
that
nothing
had
changed
during
his
absence
that
she
was
still
all
his
own
when
the
agitation
of
these
first
few
speechless
minutes
had
subsided
a
great
tenderness
seized
louise
freeing
one
hand
she
smoothed
back
his
hair
from
his
forehead
with
movements
each
of
which
was
a
caress
as
for
him
his
first
impetuous
rush
of
feeling
was
invariably
followed
by
an
almost
morbid
pity
for
her
which
in
this
form
was
a
new
note
in
their
relation
to
each
other
or
a
harking
back
to
the
oldest
note
of
all
when
he
considered
how
dependent
she
was
on
him
how
her
one
desire
was
to
have
him
with
her
he
felt
that
he
could
never
repay
her
or
do
enough
for
her
and
whatever
his
own
state
of
mind
previous
to
coming
when
once
he
was
there
he
exerted
himself
to
the
utmost
to
cheer
her
it
was
always
she
who
needed
consolation
and
by
means
of
his
endearments
she
was
petted
back
to
happiness
like
a
tired
child
in
his
efforts
to
take
her
out
of
herself
maurice
told
her
how
he
had
spent
the
day
where
he
had
been
and
whom
he
had
met
every
detail
that
he
thought
might
interest
her
she
listened
in
grateful
silence
but
she
never
put
a
question
this
at
an
end
he
returned
once
more
in
a
kind
of
eternal
circle
to
the
one
subject
of
which
she
never
wearied
he
might
repeat
for
the
thousandth
time
how
dear
she
was
to
him
without
the
least
fear
that
the
story
would
grow
stale
in
the
telling
and
once
here
amidst
the
deep
tenderness
of
his
words
he
felt
her
slowly
come
to
life
again
and
unfold
like
a
flower
after
the
long
dead
day
louise
was
consumed
by
a
desire
to
drain
such
moments
as
these
to
the
dregs
she
did
not
let
a
word
of
his
pass
unchallenged
and
all
that
she
herself
said
was
an
attempt
to
discover
some
spasm
of
mental
ecstasy
which
they
had
not
yet
experienced
sometimes
the
feeling
grew
so
strong
that
it
forced
her
to
give
an
outward
sign
slipping
to
her
knees
she
gazed
at
him
with
the
eyes
of
a
faithful
animal
what
have
i
done
to
make
you
look
at
me
like
that
asked
maurice
amazed
what
can
i
do
to
show
you
how
i
love
you
tell
me
what
i
can
do
do
what
do
you
want
to
do
be
your
own
dear
self
that
all
and
more
than
enough
but
she
continued
to
look
beseechingly
at
him
waiting
for
the
word
that
might
be
the
word
of
her
salvation
have
you
done
enough
already
in
giving
yourself
to
me
he
asked
seeing
how
she
hung
on
his
lips
but
she
repeated
what
can
i
do
let
me
do
something
oh
i
wish
you
would
hurt
me
or
be
unkind
to
me
he
tried
to
make
her
understand
that
he
wished
for
no
such
humble
adoration
that
indeed
he
could
not
be
happy
under
it
if
either
was
to
serve
the
other
it
was
he
he
asked
nothing
better
than
to
put
his
hands
under
her
feet
but
he
could
neither
coax
her
nor
laugh
her
out
of
her
absorption
she
had
the
will
to
and
she
remained
unsatisfied
waiting
for
the
word
he
would
not
speak
once
or
twice
during
these
weeks
they
went
out
in
the
evening
and
in
the
corner
of
some
quiet
restaurant
took
a
festive
little
meal
but
for
the
most
part
she
preferred
to
stay
at
home
she
was
not
dressed
she
said
or
she
was
tired
or
it
was
too
hot
or
it
had
rained
and
maurice
did
not
urge
her
for
on
the
last
occasion
the
evening
had
been
spoiled
for
him
by
the
conduct
of
some
people
at
a
neighbouring
table
they
had
stared
at
louise
and
whispered
remarks
about
her
at
home
she
herself
prepared
the
supper
moving
indolently
about
the
room
her
dragging
after
her
from
table
to
cupboard
and
back
again
often
with
a
pause
at
his
side
in
which
she
forgot
what
she
had
set
out
for
maurice
disputed
each
trifling
service
with
her
he
could
only
think
of
louise
as
made
to
be
waited
on
slow
to
serve
herself
let
me
do
it
dearest
she
had
risen
anew
to
fetch
something
now
she
stood
beside
him
and
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
what
can
i
do
for
you
tell
me
what
i
can
do
she
said
and
crushed
his
head
against
her
breast
he
loosened
her
fingers
and
drew
her
to
his
knee
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
dear
discontent
do
you
were
never
meant
to
do
anything
in
this
world
your
hands
were
made
to
lie
one
on
top
of
the
other
so
look
at
them
most
white
and
most
useless
there
are
things
not
made
with
hands
she
answered
obscurely
she
let
him
do
what
he
liked
but
she
kept
her
face
turned
away
and
over
her
eyes
passed
a
faint
shadow
of
resignation
but
this
mood
also
was
a
transient
one
hours
followed
when
she
no
longer
sought
and
questioned
but
when
she
gave
recklessly
in
a
wild
endeavour
to
lose
the
sense
of
twofold
being
and
before
these
outbreaks
the
young
man
was
helpless
his
past
life
and
such
experience
as
he
had
gathered
in
it
grew
fantastic
and
unreal
might
all
have
belonged
to
some
one
else
the
sole
reality
in
a
world
of
shadows
was
this
soft
human
body
that
he
held
in
his
arms
point
by
point
however
each
of
which
wounded
consciousness
fought
itself
free
again
such
violent
extremes
of
emotion
were
in
truth
contrary
to
his
nature
they
made
him
unsure
and
as
the
pendulum
swung
back
something
vital
in
him
made
protest
sometimes
it
seems
as
if
there
were
something
else
something
that
not
love
at
all
more
like
hate
yes
as
if
you
hated
me
would
like
to
kill
me
her
whole
body
was
moved
by
the
sigh
she
drew
if
i
only
could
then
i
should
know
that
you
were
mine
indeed
is
it
possible
for
me
to
be
more
yours
than
i
am
part
of
you
would
never
be
mine
though
we
spent
all
our
lives
together
he
roused
himself
from
his
lethargy
how
can
you
say
that
and
yet
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean
it
like
a
kind
of
rage
that
comes
over
one
yes
i
felt
it
too
listen
darling
there
are
things
one
ca
say
in
daylight
i
too
have
felt
sometimes
that
in
spite
of
all
my
love
for
you
i
mean
our
love
for
each
other
yet
there
was
still
something
a
part
of
you
i
had
no
power
over
the
real
you
is
something
some
one
i
do
really
know
in
spite
of
all
the
kisses
yes
and
the
more
he
tried
to
find
words
for
what
he
meant
the
more
convinced
he
grew
of
its
truth
nothing
keeps
us
apart
you
love
me
are
here
in
my
arms
and
yet
yet
there
a
bit
of
you
i
influence
that
is
still
strange
to
me
how
often
i
have
to
ask
you
why
you
look
at
me
in
a
certain
way
or
what
you
are
thinking
of
i
never
know
your
thoughts
i
never
once
been
able
to
read
them
you
always
keep
something
why
is
it
dear
is
it
my
fault
if
i
could
just
once
get
at
your
real
self
if
i
knew
that
once
only
once
in
all
these
weeks
you
had
been
mine
every
bit
of
you
then
yes
then
i
believe
i
would
be
satisfied
to
to
i
do
know
what
he
had
spoken
in
an
even
monotonous
voice
almost
more
to
himself
than
to
her
now
however
he
was
forced
to
the
opposite
extreme
of
anxious
solicitude
no
no
i
did
really
mean
it
darling
hush
cry
like
that
i
did
know
what
i
was
saying
it
is
true
not
a
word
of
it
she
had
flung
herself
across
him
her
own
elemental
weeping
shook
her
from
head
to
foot
he
realised
for
the
first
time
the
depth
and
strength
of
it
now
that
it
as
it
were
went
through
him
too
gathering
her
to
him
he
made
wild
and
foolish
promises
but
nothing
soothed
her
she
wept
on
until
the
dawn
crept
in
thinly
grey
round
the
windows
but
when
it
grew
so
light
that
the
objects
in
the
room
were
recovering
their
form
she
fell
asleep
and
he
hardly
dared
to
breathe
for
fear
of
disturbing
her
by
day
the
sensations
he
had
tried
to
express
to
her
seemed
the
figments
of
the
night
he
needed
only
to
be
absent
from
her
to
feel
the
old
restlessness
tug
at
his
at
such
moments
it
seemed
to
him
ridiculous
to
torment
himself
about
an
infinitesimal
flaw
in
their
love
and
one
which
perhaps
existed
only
in
his
imagination
to
be
with
her
again
was
his
sole
desire
and
to
feel
her
cheek
on
his
to
be
free
to
run
his
hands
through
her
exciting
hair
belonged
when
he
was
separated
from
her
to
that
small
category
of
things
for
which
he
would
have
bartered
his
soul
one
evening
towards
the
end
of
september
louise
watched
for
him
at
the
window
it
had
been
a
warm
autumn
day
rich
in
varying
lights
and
shades
now
it
was
late
nearly
six
and
still
he
had
not
come
her
eyes
were
tired
with
staring
down
the
street
when
at
last
he
appeared
she
saw
that
that
he
was
carrying
flowers
her
heart
which
at
the
sight
of
him
had
set
up
a
glad
and
violent
beating
settled
down
again
at
once
to
its
normal
course
she
knew
what
the
flowers
meant
in
a
spirit
of
candour
which
had
something
disarming
in
it
he
invariably
brought
them
when
he
could
not
stay
long
with
her
and
she
had
learned
to
dread
seeing
them
in
his
hand
in
very
truth
he
was
barely
inside
the
room
before
he
told
her
that
he
could
only
stay
for
an
hour
he
was
to
play
his
trio
the
following
evening
and
now
at
the
last
moment
the
had
been
taken
ill
he
had
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
afternoon
looking
for
a
substitute
and
having
found
one
had
still
to
interview
him
again
to
let
him
know
the
time
at
which
schwarz
had
appointed
an
extra
rehearsal
for
the
next
day
maurice
had
mentioned
more
than
once
the
date
of
his
playing
but
it
had
never
seemed
more
to
louise
than
a
disturbing
outside
fact
to
be
put
out
of
mind
or
kissed
away
she
had
forgotten
all
about
it
and
the
knowledge
of
this
overcame
her
disappointment
she
tried
to
atone
by
being
reasonable
maurice
had
steeled
himself
against
pleadings
and
despondency
and
was
grateful
to
her
for
making
things
easy
he
wished
to
outdo
himself
in
tender
encouragement
but
she
remained
evasive
and
since
in
spite
of
himself
he
could
not
hinder
his
thoughts
from
slipping
forward
to
the
coming
evening
he
too
had
moments
of
preoccupied
silence
when
the
clock
struck
eight
he
rose
to
go
in
saying
goodnight
he
turned
her
face
up
and
asked
her
had
she
decided
if
she
were
coming
to
hear
him
play
it
was
on
her
direct
lips
to
reply
that
she
had
not
thought
anything
about
it
a
glance
at
his
face
checked
her
he
was
waiting
anxiously
for
her
answer
it
was
a
matter
of
importance
to
him
her
previous
sense
of
remissness
was
still
with
her
hampering
her
making
her
unfree
and
for
a
minute
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
would
you
mind
much
if
i
asked
you
not
to
come
he
said
as
she
hesitated
no
of
course
not
she
hastened
to
respond
glad
to
be
relieved
of
the
decision
if
you
would
rather
i
did
it
a
fancy
of
mine
dearest
foolish
i
know
that
i
shall
get
on
better
if
you
not
there
it
all
right
i
understand
when
he
had
gone
she
returned
to
her
place
at
the
window
it
was
a
fine
night
there
was
no
moon
but
the
stars
glittered
furiously
in
the
sky
a
stretch
of
which
was
visible
above
the
gardens
the
vastness
of
the
night
the
distance
of
sky
and
stars
made
her
shiver
leaning
her
wrists
on
the
cold
moist
sill
she
looked
down
into
the
street
it
was
not
very
far
but
a
jump
from
where
she
was
to
the
pavement
would
suffice
to
put
an
end
to
every
feeling
she
was
very
lonely
no
one
wanted
her
here
she
might
stand
at
this
forlorn
post
for
hours
for
the
whole
night
no
one
would
either
know
or
and
her
feeling
of
error
of
unfreedom
and
desolation
grew
so
hard
to
bear
that
for
fear
she
should
actually
throw
herself
down
she
banged
the
window
to
with
a
crash
that
resounded
through
the
street
but
there
was
something
else
at
work
in
her
which
she
could
not
understand
she
struggled
with
it
as
one
struggles
with
a
forgotten
melody
which
hovers
behind
the
consciousness
and
will
not
emerge
except
for
the
light
thrown
by
a
small
lamp
the
room
was
in
shadow
she
went
slowly
back
to
the
sofa
on
the
way
she
trod
on
the
roses
they
had
been
knocked
down
and
forgotten
she
picked
them
up
and
laid
them
on
the
cushioned
seat
beside
her
they
were
dark
crimson
and
gave
out
a
strong
scent
maurice
had
seldom
brought
her
such
beautiful
roses
she
sat
with
her
elbows
on
her
knees
her
hands
closed
and
pressed
to
her
cheeks
as
though
she
could
only
think
with
her
muscles
at
a
strain
in
memory
she
went
over
what
he
had
said
reflected
on
what
his
words
meant
and
strove
honestly
to
project
herself
into
that
part
of
his
life
of
which
she
knew
nothing
but
it
was
not
easy
for
one
thing
the
smell
of
the
roses
was
too
strong
it
seemed
to
hinder
her
imagination
they
had
the
scent
that
only
deep
red
roses
have
one
which
seems
to
come
from
a
distance
from
the
very
heart
of
cool
pure
things
and
more
and
more
she
felt
as
if
something
within
her
were
trying
to
find
vent
in
it
something
that
swelled
up
subsided
and
mounted
again
with
what
was
almost
a
physical
effort
it
had
been
the
truth
when
she
told
him
that
she
understood
but
it
had
touched
her
strangely
all
the
same
for
it
had
let
her
see
into
an
unsuspected
corner
of
his
nature
he
too
then
had
a
cranny
in
his
brain
where
such
fancies
lodged
such
an
eccentric
artist
fancy
or
whim
or
superstition
as
that
out
of
several
hundred
people
a
single
individual
could
distract
and
disturb
he
too
the
little
word
had
done
it
now
she
knew
knew
what
the
roses
had
been
trying
to
tell
her
and
as
if
invisible
hands
had
touched
a
spring
in
her
brain
thereby
opening
some
secret
place
the
memory
of
a
certain
hour
returned
to
her
returned
with
such
force
that
she
fell
on
her
knees
and
pressed
her
face
to
the
seat
of
the
sofa
on
the
floor
beside
her
lay
the
roses
why
oh
why
had
he
needed
to
bring
them
to
her
on
this
night
of
all
others
on
the
day
she
remembered
they
had
been
lavished
over
the
june
evening
two
years
ago
and
ever
afterwards
the
scent
of
roses
had
been
associated
for
her
with
one
of
the
sweet
leading
themes
in
beethoven
violin
concerto
there
was
a
special
concert
that
night
at
the
conservatorium
the
hall
was
filled
to
the
last
place
she
waited
with
him
in
the
until
his
turn
came
to
play
then
she
went
into
the
hall
and
stood
at
the
back
under
the
gallery
once
more
she
was
aware
of
the
stir
that
ran
through
the
audience
as
schilsky
walked
down
the
platform
hardly
however
had
he
drawn
his
bow
across
the
strings
when
she
felt
a
touch
on
her
arm
and
a
russian
who
was
an
intimate
friend
of
his
beckoned
her
outside
there
he
told
her
that
he
had
been
sent
to
ask
her
to
leave
the
hall
and
they
smiled
at
each
other
in
understanding
of
the
whim
afterwards
she
learned
how
just
about
to
step
on
to
the
platform
schilsky
had
had
a
presentiment
that
things
would
go
wrong
if
she
remained
inside
in
his
gratitude
and
in
the
boyish
exultation
with
which
success
filled
him
he
had
collected
all
the
roses
and
wantonly
pulled
them
to
pieces
red
petals
fell
like
flakes
of
red
snow
and
crushed
and
bruised
the
fragile
leaves
had
yielded
a
scent
tenfold
increased
while
it
lasted
the
vision
was
painfully
intense
on
returning
to
herself
she
was
obliged
to
look
round
and
think
where
she
was
the
lamp
burned
steadily
the
dull
room
was
just
as
she
had
left
it
with
a
cry
she
buried
her
face
in
the
cushions
again
and
held
her
hands
to
her
ears
more
more
and
more
again
she
was
as
hungry
for
these
memories
as
a
child
for
dainties
she
was
starved
for
them
and
now
dead
to
the
present
she
relived
the
past
happy
hours
of
triumph
and
excitement
not
one
of
which
had
hung
heavy
in
each
of
which
her
craving
for
sensation
had
been
stilled
she
saw
herself
as
she
had
then
been
proud
secure
unspeakably
content
forgotten
words
rang
in
her
ears
words
of
love
and
of
anger
words
that
were
like
ointment
and
like
knives
then
not
a
day
had
been
empty
or
tedious
life
was
always
highly
coloured
and
there
was
neither
pleasure
nor
pain
that
she
had
not
tasted
to
the
full
even
the
suffering
she
had
gone
through
for
his
sake
was
no
longer
hateful
to
her
anything
anything
rather
than
this
dead
level
of
monotony
on
which
she
had
fallen
when
finally
she
raised
her
head
she
might
for
all
she
knew
have
been
absent
for
days
things
had
lost
their
familiar
aspect
she
had
once
more
lived
right
through
the
great
experience
of
her
life
putting
her
hands
to
her
forehead
she
tried
to
force
her
thoughts
back
to
reality
then
stiffly
she
rose
from
her
knees
in
doing
so
she
touched
the
roses
with
a
gesture
that
was
her
real
awakening
she
caught
them
up
and
pressed
them
to
her
face
it
was
a
satisfaction
to
her
that
fingers
and
cheeks
were
pricked
by
their
thorns
she
was
conscious
of
wishing
to
hurt
herself
with
her
lips
on
the
cool
buds
she
stammered
broken
words
maurice
my
poor
maurice
and
kissed
the
flowers
feeling
as
if
in
some
occult
way
he
would
be
aware
of
her
kisses
of
the
love
she
was
thus
expending
on
him
for
in
a
sudden
revulsion
of
feeling
she
was
sensible
of
a
great
compassion
for
him
and
with
each
pressure
of
her
lips
to
the
roses
she
implored
his
forgiveness
for
her
unpremeditated
desertion
she
called
to
mind
his
tenderness
his
unceasing
care
of
her
and
closing
her
eyes
stretched
out
her
arms
to
him
in
the
empty
room
already
she
began
to
live
for
the
following
evening
when
he
would
come
again
now
only
to
sleep
through
as
many
as
she
could
of
the
hours
that
separated
them
she
would
be
to
him
the
next
night
what
she
had
never
yet
been
his
own
rival
in
fondness
and
as
a
beginning
she
crossed
the
room
and
put
the
fading
roses
in
a
pitcher
of
water
iv
towards
seven
the
following
evening
maurice
loitered
about
the
vestibule
of
the
conservatorium
in
spite
of
his
attempt
to
time
himself
he
had
arrived
too
early
and
his
predecessor
on
the
programme
had
still
to
play
two
movements
of
a
sonata
by
beethoven
as
he
stood
there
madeleine
entered
by
the
is
that
you
she
asked
in
the
ironical
tone
she
now
habitually
used
to
him
you
look
just
as
if
you
were
posing
for
the
john
in
a
rubens
feel
shaky
no
you
ought
to
you
know
one
plays
all
the
better
for
well
good
luck
to
you
i
hold
my
thumbs
he
went
along
the
passage
to
the
little
at
the
heels
of
his
on
seeing
them
go
by
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
draw
their
attention
to
a
passage
in
the
variations
with
which
he
had
not
been
satisfied
at
rehearsal
that
day
but
when
he
caught
them
up
they
were
so
deep
in
talk
that
he
hesitated
to
interrupt
the
a
greasy
little
fellow
with
a
mop
of
touzled
hair
was
relating
an
adventure
he
had
had
the
night
before
his
droll
way
of
telling
it
was
more
amusing
than
the
story
and
he
himself
was
more
tickled
by
it
than
was
the
violinist
a
lanky
boy
with
oily
black
hair
and
a
pimpled
face
throughout
both
tuned
their
instruments
assiduously
with
that
air
of
inattention
common
to
meanwhile
the
sonata
by
beethoven
ran
its
course
while
the
still
smacked
his
lips
it
came
to
an
end
and
the
performer
a
tall
polish
girl
with
a
long
sallow
neck
round
which
was
wound
a
piece
of
black
velvet
descended
the
steps
behind
her
was
heard
the
applause
of
many
hands
as
this
showed
no
sign
of
ceasing
schwarz
who
had
come
out
of
the
hall
by
a
lower
door
bade
her
return
and
bow
her
thanks
at
his
words
the
girl
burst
into
tears
na
na
na
he
said
soothingly
what
all
this
about
you
did
excellently
she
seized
his
hand
and
clung
to
it
the
ran
to
fetch
water
the
other
two
young
men
were
embarrassed
and
looked
away
here
however
several
friends
burst
into
the
room
and
bore
fraulein
prybowski
off
schwarz
gave
the
signal
the
stringplayers
picked
up
their
instruments
and
the
little
procession
with
maurice
at
its
head
mounted
the
steps
to
the
platform
although
before
an
audience
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
maurice
had
never
felt
more
composed
passing
by
the
organ
and
the
empty
seats
of
the
orchestra
he
descended
to
the
front
of
the
platform
where
two
grand
pianos
stood
side
by
side
and
as
he
went
he
noted
that
the
hall
was
exceptionally
well
filled
he
let
down
the
lid
of
the
piano
to
the
peg
for
chambermusic
he
lowered
the
and
flicked
the
keys
with
his
handkerchief
and
schwarz
sitting
by
him
to
turn
the
pages
of
the
music
felt
so
sure
of
this
pupil
coolness
that
he
yawned
and
stroked
the
insides
of
his
maurice
was
just
ready
for
the
start
when
the
who
was
restless
discovered
that
the
stand
which
had
been
placed
for
him
was
insecure
rising
from
his
scat
he
went
to
fetch
another
from
the
back
of
the
platform
in
the
delay
that
ensued
maurice
looked
round
at
the
audience
he
saw
innumerable
heads
and
faces
all
turned
expectantly
towards
him
like
lines
of
globular
fruits
his
eye
ranged
indifferently
over
the
occupants
of
the
front
seats
strange
faces
which
told
him
nothing
until
his
attention
was
arrested
by
a
face
almost
directly
beneath
him
in
the
second
row
for
the
flash
of
a
second
he
thought
he
knew
the
person
to
whom
it
belonged
and
struggled
to
recall
a
name
then
almost
as
swiftly
he
dismissed
the
idea
it
was
however
a
face
of
that
kind
which
once
seen
is
never
forgotten
a
face
with
protruding
eyes
and
the
expressive
leer
somewhere
not
very
long
ago
this
face
had
been
before
him
and
had
stared
at
him
in
the
same
disconcerting
manner
but
where
when
in
the
few
seconds
that
remained
his
brain
worked
furiously
sped
back
in
desperate
haste
over
all
the
likely
places
where
he
might
have
seen
it
and
a
restaurant
evolved
itself
a
table
in
a
secluded
corner
chrysanthemums
and
their
acrid
scent
a
screen
round
which
this
repulsive
face
had
peered
it
had
fixed
them
both
with
such
malevolence
that
it
had
destroyed
his
pleasure
and
he
had
persuaded
louise
to
go
home
his
memory
was
now
so
alert
that
he
could
recall
the
man
two
companions
as
well
the
scene
built
itself
up
with
inconceivable
rapidity
and
while
he
was
still
absorbed
by
it
schwarz
raised
a
decisive
hand
it
was
the
signal
to
begin
he
obeyed
unthinkingly
and
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
first
page
before
he
knew
it
throughout
the
whole
of
the
opening
movement
he
was
not
rightly
awake
to
what
he
was
doing
his
fingers
like
soldiers
went
automatically
through
their
work
neither
blundering
nor
forgetting
but
the
mind
which
should
have
controlled
them
was
unable
to
concentrate
itself
he
heard
himself
play
as
though
he
were
listening
to
some
one
else
he
was
only
roused
by
the
burst
of
applause
that
succeeded
the
final
chords
as
he
struck
the
first
notes
of
the
andante
with
variations
he
nerved
himself
for
an
effort
but
now
as
if
it
were
the
result
of
his
previous
inattention
an
odd
uneasiness
beset
him
and
his
beginning
to
weigh
each
note
as
he
played
it
his
fingers
hesitated
and
grew
less
sure
having
failed
through
in
the
rounding
of
a
turn
he
resolved
to
let
things
go
as
they
would
and
his
thoughts
wander
at
will
the
movements
of
the
trio
succeeded
one
another
the
variations
ceased
and
were
followed
by
the
crisp
gaiety
of
the
minuet
the
lights
above
his
head
were
reflected
in
the
shining
ebony
of
the
piano
regularly
every
moment
or
two
he
was
struck
by
the
appearance
of
schwarz
broad
fat
hand
which
crossed
his
range
of
vision
to
turn
a
leaf
he
meditated
absently
on
a
sharp
uplifting
of
this
hand
that
occurred
as
though
the
master
were
dissatisfied
with
the
rhythm
the
fault
no
doubt
he
had
been
inexact
at
rehearsal
and
this
evening
was
too
much
taken
up
with
his
own
witticisms
beforehand
to
think
about
what
he
had
to
do
and
thus
the
four
divisions
of
the
trio
slipped
past
separated
by
a
disturbing
noise
of
hands
which
continued
to
seem
as
unreal
to
maurice
as
everything
else
only
as
the
last
notes
of
the
prestissimo
died
away
in
the
disappointing
ineffectual
scales
in
c
major
with
which
the
trio
closed
not
till
then
did
he
grasp
that
the
event
to
which
he
had
looked
forward
for
many
weeks
was
behind
him
and
also
that
no
one
present
knew
less
of
how
it
had
passed
off
than
he
himself
with
his
music
in
his
hand
he
turned
to
schwarz
to
learn
what
success
he
had
had
from
the
master
face
according
to
custom
schwarz
shook
hands
with
him
he
also
nodded
but
he
did
not
smile
he
was
however
in
a
hurry
the
old
director
had
left
his
seat
and
stood
waiting
to
speak
to
him
both
and
violinist
had
vanished
on
the
instant
the
audience
eager
as
ever
at
the
end
of
a
concert
to
shake
off
an
imposed
restraint
had
risen
while
maurice
still
played
the
final
notes
and
by
this
time
the
hall
was
all
but
empty
he
slowly
ascended
the
platform
now
that
it
was
over
he
felt
how
tired
he
was
his
very
legs
were
tired
as
though
he
had
walked
for
miles
the
was
deserted
the
had
been
screwed
down
to
a
peep
none
of
his
friends
had
come
to
say
a
word
to
him
he
had
really
hardly
expected
it
but
all
the
same
a
hope
had
lurked
in
him
that
krafft
would
perhaps
afterwards
make
some
sign
even
madeleine
as
however
neither
of
them
appeared
he
seemed
to
read
a
confirmation
of
his
failure
in
their
absence
and
he
loitered
for
some
time
in
the
unwilling
to
face
the
dispersing
crowd
when
at
length
he
went
down
the
passage
only
a
few
stragglers
remained
one
or
two
acquaintances
congratulated
him
in
due
form
but
he
knew
neither
well
enough
to
try
to
get
at
the
truth
as
he
was
nearing
the
however
dove
came
out
of
the
bureau
he
made
for
maurice
at
once
his
manner
was
eager
his
face
bore
the
imprint
of
interesting
news
i
say
guest
he
cried
while
still
some
way
off
an
odd
coincidence
young
leumann
is
to
play
this
very
same
trio
next
week
a
little
chap
in
knickerbockers
you
know
pupils
of
rendel
he
is
said
to
have
a
glorious
legato
just
the
very
thing
for
the
variations
indeed
said
maurice
with
a
dryness
his
tone
nudged
dove
memory
by
the
way
all
congratulations
of
course
he
hastened
to
add
never
heard
you
play
better
especially
the
menuetto
some
people
sitting
behind
me
were
reminded
of
rubinstein
well
i
off
said
maurice
and
even
as
he
spoke
he
shot
away
leaving
his
companion
in
some
surprise
once
out
of
dove
sight
he
took
off
his
hat
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
any
slender
hope
he
might
have
had
was
now
crushed
his
playing
had
been
so
little
remarkable
that
even
dove
had
been
on
the
point
of
overlooking
it
altogether
louise
threw
herself
into
his
arms
at
last
she
exulted
to
herself
but
his
greeting
had
not
its
usual
fervour
instead
of
kissing
her
he
laid
his
face
against
her
hair
instantly
she
became
uncertain
she
did
not
quite
know
what
she
had
been
expecting
perhaps
it
had
been
something
of
the
old
pleasurable
excitement
that
she
had
learnt
to
associate
with
an
occasion
like
the
present
she
put
back
her
head
and
looked
at
him
and
her
look
was
a
question
yes
at
least
it
over
thank
goodness
he
said
in
reply
not
knowing
what
answer
to
make
to
this
she
led
him
to
the
sofa
they
sat
down
and
for
a
few
minutes
neither
spoke
then
he
did
what
on
the
way
there
he
had
imagined
himself
doing
laid
his
head
on
her
lap
and
himself
placed
her
hands
on
his
hair
she
passed
them
backwards
and
forwards
her
sense
of
having
been
repulsed
yielded
and
she
tried
to
change
the
current
of
his
thoughts
did
you
notice
maurice
as
you
came
along
how
full
the
air
was
of
different
scents
she
asked
as
her
cool
hands
went
to
and
fro
it
was
like
an
evening
in
july
i
was
at
the
window
trying
to
make
them
out
but
the
roses
were
too
strong
for
them
for
you
see
or
rather
you
have
not
seen
all
the
roses
i
have
got
for
you
yes
just
dark
red
roses
this
afternoon
i
went
to
the
little
shop
at
the
corner
and
bought
all
they
had
the
pretty
girl
served
me
do
you
remember
the
pretty
girl
with
the
yellow
hair
who
tried
to
make
friends
with
you
last
summer
you
like
roses
too
do
you
though
not
as
much
as
i
do
they
were
always
my
favourite
flowers
as
a
child
i
used
to
imagine
what
it
would
be
like
to
gather
them
for
a
whole
day
without
stopping
but
like
all
my
wishes
then
this
had
to
be
postponed
too
till
that
wonderful
future
which
was
to
bring
me
all
i
wanted
there
were
only
a
few
bushes
where
i
lived
it
was
too
dry
for
them
but
the
smell
of
them
takes
me
back
always
i
have
only
to
shut
my
eyes
and
i
am
full
of
the
old
extravagant
longings
the
childish
impatience
with
time
which
seemed
to
crawl
so
slowly
even
to
stand
still
tell
me
all
about
it
he
murmured
without
raising
his
head
she
smiled
and
humoured
him
i
like
flowers
best
for
their
scents
she
went
on
no
matter
what
beautiful
colours
they
have
a
camelia
is
a
foolish
flower
like
a
blind
man
face
the
chief
thing
is
wanting
but
then
of
course
the
smell
must
remind
one
of
pleasant
things
it
strange
is
it
how
much
association
has
to
do
with
pleasure
or
pain
some
things
affect
me
so
strongly
that
they
make
me
wretched
there
music
i
ca
listen
to
i
have
to
put
my
hands
to
my
ears
and
run
away
from
it
and
all
because
it
takes
me
back
to
an
unhappy
hour
or
to
a
time
of
my
life
that
i
hated
there
are
streets
i
never
walk
through
even
words
i
dread
to
hear
anyone
say
because
they
are
connected
with
some
one
i
disliked
or
a
day
i
would
rather
not
have
lived
and
it
is
just
the
same
with
smells
wood
smouldering
outside
and
all
the
country
round
is
smoky
with
bush
fires
mimosa
in
the
room
and
i
can
feel
the
sun
beating
down
on
deserted
shafts
and
the
stillness
of
the
bush
rotting
leaves
and
the
smell
of
moist
earth
and
i
am
a
little
girl
again
in
short
dresses
standing
by
a
grave
my
father
to
which
i
was
driven
in
a
high
buggy
between
two
men
in
black
coats
i
ca
remember
crying
at
all
or
even
feeling
sorry
i
only
smelt
the
earth
it
was
in
the
rainy
season
and
there
was
water
in
the
but
flowers
give
me
my
pleasantest
memories
and
periwinkles
you
will
say
they
have
no
smell
but
it
not
true
flat
open
passionflowers
red
or
white
with
centres
have
a
and
make
me
think
of
long
hot
cloudless
days
which
seemed
to
have
neither
beginning
nor
end
and
little
periwinkles
have
a
cool
green
smell
for
they
grew
along
an
old
paling
fence
which
was
shady
and
sometimes
even
damp
and
violets
i
never
really
cared
for
violets
not
till
i
mean
i
never
she
had
entangled
herself
and
broke
off
so
abruptly
that
he
moved
he
was
afraid
this
soothing
flow
of
words
was
going
to
cease
yes
yes
go
on
tell
me
some
more
about
violets
she
hastened
to
recover
herself
they
are
silly
little
flowers
made
to
wither
in
one
dress
or
to
be
crushed
unless
one
could
have
them
in
such
masses
that
they
filled
the
room
but
lilac
maurice
great
sprays
and
bunches
of
and
purple
you
know
you
who
will
always
be
associated
with
lilac
for
me
do
you
remember
some
of
those
evenings
at
the
theatre
on
the
balcony
between
the
acts
the
gallery
was
so
hot
and
out
there
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
town
were
steeped
in
lilac
or
walking
home
those
glorious
nights
when
some
one
was
so
silent
so
moody
do
you
remember
at
the
peculiar
veiled
tone
that
had
come
into
her
voice
at
this
reminder
of
a
past
day
of
alternate
rapture
and
despair
so
different
from
the
secured
happiness
of
the
present
at
the
thought
of
this
common
memory
that
had
built
itself
up
for
them
round
a
flower
scent
a
rush
of
grateful
content
overcame
maurice
and
for
the
first
time
since
entering
the
room
he
looked
up
at
her
with
a
lover
eyes
safe
with
her
arms
round
him
he
was
strong
enough
to
face
the
worst
how
good
you
are
to
me
dearest
and
i
do
deserve
it
you
might
just
have
sent
me
away
again
when
i
came
for
i
was
in
a
disagreeable
mood
and
still
am
but
you
wo
give
me
up
just
yet
for
all
that
will
you
however
despondent
i
get
about
myself
for
you
are
all
i
have
louise
in
the
whole
world
yes
i
may
as
well
confess
it
to
you
was
a
failure
not
a
noisy
open
one
but
all
the
same
it
no
use
calling
it
anything
else
he
had
laid
his
head
on
her
lap
again
so
did
not
see
her
face
while
he
spoke
louise
looked
at
him
in
a
kind
of
unwilling
surprise
instinctively
she
ceased
to
pass
her
hands
over
his
hair
oh
no
maurice
she
then
protested
but
weakly
without
conviction
yes
failure
he
repeated
and
put
more
emphasis
than
before
on
the
word
it
no
good
beating
about
the
and
do
you
realise
what
it
what
failure
means
for
us
louise
oh
no
she
said
again
vaguely
trying
to
ward
off
what
she
foresaw
was
coming
and
why
talk
about
it
you
are
tired
things
will
seem
different
in
the
morning
shut
your
eyes
again
and
lie
quite
still
but
the
ice
once
broken
he
felt
the
need
of
speaking
of
speaking
out
relentlessly
all
that
was
in
him
and
as
he
talked
he
found
it
impossible
to
keep
still
he
paced
the
room
he
was
very
pale
and
very
voluble
and
made
a
clean
breast
of
everything
that
troubled
him
not
so
much
however
with
the
idea
of
confessing
it
to
her
as
of
easing
his
own
mind
and
now
again
he
let
her
see
into
his
real
self
and
unlike
the
previous
occasion
it
was
here
more
than
a
glimpse
that
she
caught
he
was
distressingly
frank
with
her
she
heard
now
for
the
first
time
of
the
foolish
ambitions
with
which
he
had
begun
his
studies
in
leipzig
heard
of
their
gradual
subsidence
and
his
humble
acceptance
of
his
inferiority
as
well
as
of
his
present
fear
that
when
his
time
came
to
an
end
he
would
have
nothing
to
show
for
it
and
under
the
influence
of
what
had
just
happened
this
fear
grew
more
vivid
it
was
one
thing
he
made
clear
to
her
and
unpleasant
enough
at
best
to
have
to
find
yourself
to
rights
as
a
mediocrity
when
you
had
hoped
with
all
your
heart
that
you
were
something
more
but
what
if
having
staked
everything
on
it
you
should
discover
that
you
had
mistaken
your
calling
altogether
you
see
i
think
i
should
have
been
a
better
the
real
something
that
makes
the
musician
even
the
genuinely
musical
outsider
is
wanting
in
me
i
learnt
to
see
that
by
degrees
though
i
do
know
in
the
least
what
it
but
even
suppose
i
were
mistaken
who
could
tell
me
that
i
was
one
friends
are
only
too
glad
to
avoid
giving
a
downright
opinion
and
then
too
which
of
them
would
one
care
to
trust
i
believe
in
the
end
i
shall
go
straight
to
schwarz
and
get
him
to
tell
me
what
he
thinks
of
me
whether
i
making
a
fool
of
myself
or
not
oh
i
would
do
that
louise
said
quickly
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
interrupted
him
she
had
sat
and
followed
his
restless
movements
with
a
look
of
apprehension
a
certain
board
in
the
floor
creaked
when
he
trod
on
it
and
she
found
herself
listening
each
time
for
the
creaking
of
this
board
she
was
sorry
for
him
but
she
could
not
attach
the
importance
he
did
to
his
assumed
want
of
success
nor
was
she
able
to
subdue
the
feeling
of
distaste
with
which
his
doubtings
inspired
her
it
was
so
necessary
too
this
outpouring
she
had
never
felt
curious
about
the
side
of
his
nature
which
was
not
the
lover
side
tonight
it
became
clear
to
her
that
she
would
have
preferred
to
remain
in
ignorance
of
it
and
besides
what
he
said
was
so
palpable
so
undeniable
that
she
could
not
understand
his
dragging
the
matter
to
the
surface
she
had
never
thought
of
him
but
as
one
of
the
many
honest
workers
who
swell
the
majority
and
are
not
destined
to
rise
above
the
crowd
she
had
not
dreamed
of
his
considering
himself
in
another
light
and
it
was
painful
to
her
now
to
find
that
he
had
done
so
to
put
an
end
to
such
embarrassing
confidences
she
went
over
to
him
and
with
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
her
face
upturned
said
all
the
consoling
words
she
could
think
of
to
make
him
forget
they
had
never
yet
failed
in
their
effect
but
too
much
was
at
work
in
maurice
for
him
to
be
influenced
by
them
he
kissed
her
and
touched
her
cheek
with
his
hand
then
began
anew
and
she
moved
away
with
a
slight
impatience
which
she
did
not
try
to
conceal
you
brood
too
much
maurice
and
you
exaggerate
things
too
what
if
every
one
took
himself
so
seriously
and
talked
of
failure
because
on
a
single
occasion
he
did
do
himself
justice
it
more
than
that
with
me
but
it
a
bad
habit
i
know
not
that
i
really
mean
to
take
myself
too
seriously
but
all
my
life
i
have
been
forced
to
worry
about
things
and
to
turn
them
over
it
unhealthy
always
to
be
looking
into
yourself
let
things
go
more
and
they
carry
you
with
them
he
took
her
hands
what
words
and
i
in
the
wrong
i
know
as
usual
but
in
this
case
it
impossible
not
to
worry
what
happened
this
evening
seems
a
trifle
to
you
and
no
doubt
would
to
every
one
else
too
but
i
had
made
a
kind
of
touchstone
of
it
it
was
to
help
to
decide
the
future
that
hideously
uncertain
future
of
ours
i
believe
now
as
far
as
i
concerned
i
do
care
whether
i
ever
come
to
anything
or
not
of
course
i
should
rather
have
been
a
success
we
all
would
but
caring
for
you
has
swallowed
up
the
ridiculous
notions
i
once
had
for
your
sake
it
you
i
torment
myself
about
what
is
to
become
of
us
if
that
all
maurice
something
will
turn
up
i
sure
it
will
have
a
little
patience
and
faith
in
luck
or
fate
or
whatever
you
like
to
call
it
that
a
woman
way
of
looking
at
things
he
was
conscious
of
speaking
somewhat
unkindly
but
he
was
hurt
by
her
lack
of
sympathy
instead
however
of
smoothing
things
over
he
was
impelled
by
an
unconquerable
impulse
to
disclose
himself
still
further
besides
that
not
all
he
said
and
avoided
her
eyes
there
something
else
and
i
may
just
as
well
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
it
not
only
that
the
future
is
every
bit
as
shadowy
as
it
has
always
been
i
have
advanced
it
by
an
inch
but
i
feel
that
if
i
could
have
been
what
i
once
hoped
to
be
no
how
shall
i
put
it
you
know
dear
from
the
very
beginning
there
has
been
something
wrong
a
kind
of
barrier
between
us
has
there
how
often
i
tried
to
find
out
what
it
is
well
i
seem
to
know
if
i
were
not
such
an
mediocrity
if
i
had
really
been
able
to
achieve
something
you
would
care
for
me
yes
that
it
as
you
possibly
care
now
you
would
have
to
you
would
be
able
to
help
yourself
her
first
impulsive
denial
died
on
her
lips
as
he
continued
to
speak
she
seemed
to
feel
in
his
words
an
intention
to
wound
her
or
at
least
to
accuse
her
of
want
of
love
when
she
spoke
it
was
in
a
cool
voice
as
though
she
were
on
her
guard
against
being
touched
too
deeply
that
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
she
said
it
you
yourself
maurice
i
care
for
not
what
you
can
or
ca
do
but
these
words
added
fuel
to
his
despondency
yes
that
just
it
he
answered
for
you
i
in
two
parts
and
one
of
them
means
nothing
to
you
i
felt
it
often
enough
though
i
never
spoken
of
it
till
only
one
side
of
me
really
matters
to
you
but
if
i
been
able
to
accomplish
what
i
once
intended
to
make
a
name
for
myself
or
something
of
that
sort
then
it
would
all
have
been
different
i
could
have
forced
you
to
be
interested
in
every
single
thing
i
did
not
only
in
the
me
that
loves
you
but
in
every
jot
of
my
outside
life
as
well
louise
did
not
reply
she
had
a
moment
of
genuine
despondency
the
staunch
tenderness
she
had
been
resolved
to
feel
for
him
this
evening
collapsed
and
shrivelled
up
for
the
morbid
in
which
he
was
indulging
made
her
see
him
with
other
eyes
what
he
said
belonged
to
that
category
of
things
which
are
too
true
to
be
put
into
words
why
could
not
he
like
every
one
else
let
them
rest
and
act
as
if
they
did
not
exist
it
was
as
clear
as
day
if
he
were
different
the
whole
story
of
their
relations
would
be
different
too
but
as
he
could
not
change
his
nature
what
was
the
use
of
talking
about
it
and
of
turning
out
to
her
gaze
traits
of
mind
with
which
she
could
not
possibly
sympathise
standing
a
long
white
figure
beside
the
piano
she
let
her
arms
hang
weakly
at
her
sides
she
did
not
try
to
reason
with
him
again
or
even
to
comfort
him
she
let
him
go
on
and
on
always
in
the
same
strain
till
her
nerves
suddenly
rebelled
at
the
needless
irritation
oh
why
must
you
be
like
this
she
broke
in
on
him
why
try
to
destroy
such
happiness
as
we
have
can
you
never
be
content
from
the
way
in
which
he
seized
upon
these
words
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
only
been
waiting
for
her
to
say
them
such
happiness
as
we
have
he
repeated
there
listen
you
yourself
admit
it
admit
all
been
and
do
you
think
i
can
realise
that
and
be
happy
no
i
suffered
under
it
from
the
first
day
oh
why
loving
you
as
i
do
could
i
not
have
been
different
more
worthy
of
you
why
could
i
too
be
one
of
those
favoured
mortals
listen
to
me
he
said
lowering
his
voice
and
speaking
rapidly
let
me
make
another
confession
do
you
know
why
is
doubly
hard
to
bear
because
yes
because
i
know
you
must
be
forced
and
not
only
but
often
to
compare
me
what
i
am
and
what
i
can
do
with
with
you
know
who
i
mean
it
inevitable
the
comparison
must
be
thrust
on
you
every
day
of
your
life
but
does
that
do
you
think
make
it
any
the
easier
for
me
as
the
gist
of
what
he
was
trying
to
say
was
borne
in
upon
her
louise
winced
her
face
lost
its
tired
expression
and
grew
hard
you
are
breaking
your
word
she
said
in
a
tone
she
had
never
before
used
to
him
you
promised
me
once
the
past
should
never
be
mentioned
between
us
i
not
blind
louise
he
went
on
as
though
she
had
not
spoken
nor
am
i
in
a
mood
to
make
myself
any
illusions
the
remembrance
of
what
he
was
he
was
never
doubtful
of
himself
was
he
must
always
has
always
stood
between
us
while
i
have
racked
my
brains
to
discover
what
it
was
it
came
over
me
like
a
flash
that
it
was
he
that
he
he
spoiled
you
utterly
for
anyone
else
made
it
impossible
for
you
to
care
for
anyone
who
was
made
of
the
same
stuff
as
he
was
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
him
would
it
to
torment
you
and
make
you
suffer
for
his
own
failure
for
the
very
good
reason
that
he
never
was
a
failure
oh
i
have
the
least
doubt
what
a
sorry
figure
i
must
cut
beside
him
the
unhappy
words
came
out
slowly
and
seemed
to
linger
in
the
air
louise
did
not
break
the
pause
that
followed
and
by
her
silence
assented
to
what
he
said
she
still
stood
motionless
beside
the
piano
or
tell
me
maurice
cried
abruptly
with
a
ray
of
hope
tell
me
the
truth
about
it
all
for
once
was
it
mere
exaggeration
or
was
he
really
worth
so
much
more
than
all
the
rest
of
us
of
course
he
could
play
i
know
that
but
so
can
many
a
fool
but
all
the
other
part
of
it
his
incredible
talent
or
luck
in
everything
he
touched
was
it
just
report
or
was
it
really
something
else
tell
me
he
was
a
genius
she
answered
very
coldly
and
distinctly
and
her
voice
warned
him
once
more
that
he
was
trespassing
on
ground
to
which
he
had
no
right
but
he
was
too
excited
to
take
the
warning
a
genius
he
echoed
he
was
a
genius
yes
what
did
i
tell
you
your
very
words
imply
a
comparison
as
you
say
them
for
i
what
am
i
a
miserable
bungler
a
wretched
dilettant
or
have
you
another
word
for
it
oh
never
mind
do
be
afraid
to
say
it
i
not
sensitive
tonight
i
can
bear
to
hear
your
real
opinion
of
me
for
it
could
not
possibly
be
lower
than
my
own
let
us
get
at
the
truth
for
once
by
all
means
but
what
i
want
to
know
he
cried
a
moment
later
is
why
one
should
be
given
so
much
and
the
other
so
little
to
one
all
the
talents
and
all
your
love
and
the
other
unhappy
wretch
remains
an
outsider
his
whole
life
long
when
you
speak
in
that
tone
about
him
i
could
wish
with
all
my
heart
that
he
had
been
no
better
than
i
am
it
would
give
me
pleasure
to
know
that
he
too
had
only
been
a
dabbling
amateur
the
victim
of
a
pitiable
wish
to
be
what
he
had
the
talent
for
he
could
not
face
her
amazement
he
stared
at
the
yellow
globe
of
the
lamp
till
his
eyes
smarted
it
no
doubt
seems
despicable
to
you
he
went
on
but
i
ca
help
it
i
hate
him
for
the
way
he
was
able
to
absorb
you
he
my
worst
enemy
for
he
has
made
it
impossible
for
you
the
woman
i
love
to
love
me
wholly
in
of
course
you
ca
you
wo
understand
you
only
aghast
at
what
you
think
my
littleness
of
all
i
gone
through
you
know
nothing
and
do
want
to
know
but
with
him
it
was
different
you
had
no
difficulty
in
understanding
him
he
had
the
power
over
you
look
at
this
very
moment
you
are
siding
not
with
me
but
with
him
all
my
struggling
and
striving
counts
for
oh
if
i
could
only
understand
you
he
moved
to
and
fro
in
his
agitation
why
is
a
woman
so
impossible
does
nothing
matter
to
her
but
tangible
success
do
care
and
consideration
carry
no
weight
even
matched
against
the
blackguardly
egoism
of
what
you
call
genius
or
will
you
tell
me
that
he
considered
you
did
he
treat
you
from
beginning
to
end
like
the
scoundrel
he
was
she
raised
hostile
eyes
you
have
no
right
to
say
that
she
said
in
a
small
icy
voice
which
seemed
to
put
him
at
an
infinite
distance
from
her
you
are
not
able
to
judge
him
you
did
know
him
as
as
i
did
with
the
last
words
a
deeper
note
came
into
her
voice
and
this
was
all
maurice
heard
a
frenzied
fear
seized
him
louise
he
cried
violently
you
care
for
him
still
she
started
and
raised
her
arms
as
if
to
ward
off
a
blow
i
i
do
god
knows
i
do
i
hate
him
you
know
i
do
she
had
clapped
both
hands
to
her
face
and
held
them
there
when
she
looked
up
again
she
was
able
to
speak
as
quietly
as
before
but
do
you
want
to
make
me
hate
you
too
do
you
think
it
gives
me
a
higher
opinion
of
you
to
hear
you
talk
like
that
about
some
one
i
once
cared
for
how
can
i
find
it
anything
but
ungenerous
yes
you
are
right
he
was
different
in
every
way
he
did
know
what
it
meant
to
be
envious
of
anyone
he
was
as
different
from
you
as
day
from
night
maurice
was
hurt
to
the
quick
now
i
know
your
real
opinion
of
me
till
now
you
have
been
considerate
enough
to
hide
it
but
i
have
heard
it
from
your
own
lips
you
despise
me
well
you
drove
me
to
say
it
she
burst
out
wounded
in
her
turn
i
should
never
have
said
it
of
my
own
accord
never
oh
how
ungenerous
you
are
it
not
the
first
time
you
goaded
me
into
saying
something
and
then
turned
round
on
me
for
it
you
seem
to
enjoy
finding
out
things
you
can
feel
hurt
but
have
i
ever
complained
did
i
not
take
you
just
as
you
were
and
love
you
yes
love
you
i
knew
you
could
be
different
that
it
was
your
fault
if
you
were
and
and
but
you
what
do
you
do
you
talk
as
if
you
worship
the
ground
i
walk
on
but
you
ca
let
me
alone
you
are
always
trying
to
change
me
to
make
me
what
you
think
i
ought
to
be
her
words
came
in
haste
stumbling
one
over
the
other
as
it
became
plain
to
her
how
deeply
this
grievance
expressed
now
for
the
first
time
had
eaten
into
her
soul
you
never
said
to
yourself
what
she
is
because
it
her
nature
to
be
you
want
to
remake
my
nature
and
correct
it
you
are
always
believing
something
is
wrong
you
knew
very
well
long
ago
that
the
best
part
of
me
had
belonged
to
some
one
else
you
swore
it
did
matter
but
because
absolutely
nothing
else
you
can
cavil
at
you
drag
it
up
again
in
spite
of
your
promises
i
have
always
been
frank
with
you
do
you
thank
me
for
it
no
it
been
my
old
fault
of
giving
everything
when
it
would
have
been
wiser
to
keep
something
back
or
at
least
to
pretend
to
i
might
have
taken
a
lesson
from
you
in
parsimonious
reserve
for
there
a
part
of
you
you
could
give
away
not
if
you
lived
with
a
person
for
a
hundred
years
of
all
she
said
the
last
words
stung
him
most
yes
and
why
he
cried
ask
yourself
why
i
you
are
unjust
as
only
a
woman
can
be
you
say
there
a
part
of
me
you
do
know
if
true
what
does
it
mean
it
means
you
do
want
to
know
it
you
want
it
even
to
exist
you
want
everything
to
belong
to
you
you
care
for
me
well
enough
to
be
interested
in
that
side
of
my
life
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
you
your
love
is
strong
enough
for
that
love
need
we
talk
about
love
her
face
was
so
unhappy
that
it
seemed
to
have
grown
years
older
love
is
something
quite
different
it
takes
everything
just
as
it
is
you
have
never
really
loved
i
have
never
really
loved
you
he
repeated
the
words
after
her
as
if
he
did
not
understand
them
and
with
his
right
hand
grasped
the
table
the
ground
seemed
to
be
slipping
from
under
his
feet
but
louise
did
not
offer
to
retract
what
she
had
said
and
maurice
had
a
moment
of
bewilderment
there
not
three
yards
from
him
sat
the
woman
who
was
the
centre
of
his
life
louise
sat
there
and
with
all
appearance
of
believing
it
could
cast
doubts
on
his
love
for
her
at
the
thought
of
it
he
was
exasperated
i
not
love
you
his
voice
was
rough
had
escaped
control
you
have
only
to
lift
your
finger
and
i
throw
myself
from
that
window
on
to
the
pavement
louise
sat
as
if
turned
to
stone
do
you
hear
he
cried
more
loudly
look
up
tell
me
to
do
it
still
she
did
not
move
louise
louise
he
implored
throwing
himself
down
before
her
speak
to
me
do
you
hear
me
louise
oh
yes
i
hear
she
said
at
last
i
hear
how
ready
you
are
with
promises
you
know
you
will
not
be
asked
to
keep
but
the
small
everyday
things
those
are
what
you
wo
do
for
me
tell
me
tell
me
what
i
shall
do
all
i
ask
of
you
is
to
be
happy
and
to
let
me
be
happy
too
he
stammered
promises
and
entreaties
never
never
again
if
only
this
once
she
would
forgive
him
if
only
she
would
smile
at
him
and
let
the
light
come
back
to
her
eyes
he
had
not
been
responsible
for
his
actions
this
evening
it
was
more
of
a
strain
than
i
knew
and
after
it
was
over
i
had
to
vent
my
disappointment
somehow
and
it
was
you
poor
darling
who
suffered
forgive
me
louise
but
try
dear
a
little
to
understand
why
it
was
ca
you
see
that
i
was
only
like
that
through
fear
yes
fear
that
somehow
you
might
slip
from
me
i
ca
help
feeling
one
day
you
will
have
had
enough
of
me
and
will
see
me
for
what
i
really
am
he
tried
to
put
his
arms
round
her
but
she
held
back
she
had
no
desire
to
be
reconciled
the
sole
response
she
made
to
his
beseeching
words
was
i
want
to
be
happy
but
you
do
you
think
i
live
for
anything
else
only
forgive
me
remember
the
happiest
hours
we
have
spent
together
come
back
to
me
be
mine
again
tell
me
i
am
forgiven
he
was
in
despair
he
could
not
get
at
her
under
her
coating
of
insensibility
and
since
his
words
had
no
power
to
move
her
he
took
to
kissing
her
hands
she
left
them
limply
in
his
she
did
not
resist
him
from
this
he
drew
courage
he
began
to
treat
her
more
inconsiderately
compelling
her
to
bend
down
to
him
making
her
feel
his
strength
and
he
did
not
cease
his
efforts
till
her
head
had
sunk
forward
heavy
and
submissive
on
his
shoulder
they
were
at
peace
again
and
the
joys
of
reconciliation
seemed
almost
worth
the
price
they
had
paid
for
them
the
following
morning
having
drunk
his
coffee
maurice
pushed
back
the
metal
tray
on
which
the
stood
and
remained
sitting
idle
with
his
hands
before
him
it
was
nine
and
the
houses
across
the
road
were
beginning
to
catch
stray
sunbeams
by
this
time
his
daily
work
was
as
a
rule
in
full
swing
but
he
was
in
no
hurry
to
commence
he
was
even
more
certain
now
than
he
had
been
on
the
night
before
of
his
lack
of
success
and
the
idea
of
starting
anew
on
the
dull
round
filled
him
with
distaste
he
had
been
so
confident
that
his
playing
would
in
some
way
or
other
mark
a
in
his
musical
career
and
lo
it
had
gone
off
with
as
little
fizz
and
effect
as
a
damp
rocket
lighting
a
cigarette
he
indulged
in
ironical
reflections
but
none
the
less
he
heard
the
minutes
ticking
past
and
as
he
was
not
only
a
creature
of
habit
but
had
also
a
troublesome
northern
conscience
he
rose
before
the
cigarette
had
formed
its
second
spike
of
ash
and
went
to
the
piano
no
matter
how
rebellious
he
felt
this
was
the
only
occupation
open
to
him
and
so
he
set
staunchly
out
on
the
unlovely
mechanical
exercising
which
no
pianist
can
escape
meanwhile
he
recapitulated
the
scene
in
the
concert
hall
from
the
few
anticipatory
moments
when
the
related
amatory
adventures
to
the
abrupt
leave
he
had
taken
of
dove
at
the
door
of
the
building
and
in
the
course
of
doing
this
he
was
invaded
by
a
mild
and
agreeable
doubt
on
such
shadowy
impressions
as
these
had
he
built
up
his
assumption
of
failure
was
it
possible
to
be
so
positive
the
unreal
state
of
mind
in
which
he
had
played
hindered
him
from
acting
as
his
own
judge
the
fact
that
schwarz
had
not
been
effusive
and
that
none
of
his
friends
had
sought
him
out
admitted
of
more
than
one
interpretation
the
only
real
proof
he
had
was
dove
manner
to
him
and
was
not
dove
always
too
full
of
his
own
affairs
or
at
least
the
affairs
of
those
who
were
not
present
at
the
moment
to
have
any
attention
to
spare
for
the
person
he
was
actually
with
at
the
idea
that
he
was
perhaps
mistaken
maurice
grew
so
unsettled
that
he
rose
from
the
piano
but
by
the
time
he
took
his
seat
again
he
had
wavered
say
what
he
would
he
could
not
get
rid
of
the
belief
that
if
he
had
achieved
anything
out
of
the
common
madeleine
would
not
have
made
it
her
business
to
avoid
him
after
this
however
his
fluctuating
hopes
rallied
then
sank
once
more
until
it
ended
in
his
leaving
the
piano
for
it
was
of
no
use
trying
to
concentrate
his
thoughts
until
he
knew
even
as
he
said
this
to
himself
his
resolution
was
taken
there
was
only
one
person
to
whom
he
could
apply
and
that
was
schwarz
the
proceeding
might
be
unusual
but
then
the
circumstances
in
which
he
was
placed
were
unusual
too
besides
he
asked
neither
praise
nor
flattery
merely
a
candid
opinion
if
however
he
faced
schwarz
on
this
point
there
were
others
on
which
he
might
as
well
get
certainty
at
the
same
time
the
matter
of
the
prufung
for
instance
had
still
to
be
decided
so
much
depended
on
the
choice
of
piece
his
fingers
itched
towards
chopin
or
mendelssohn
for
the
sole
reason
that
the
technique
of
these
composers
was
in
his
blood
whereas
beethoven
he
knew
from
experience
how
difficult
it
was
to
get
a
satisfactory
effect
out
of
the
stern
barenesses
of
beethoven
they
demanded
a
skill
he
could
never
hope
to
possess
between
five
and
six
that
afternoon
he
made
his
way
to
the
sebastian
where
schwarz
lived
it
was
hot
in
the
new
shadeless
streets
through
which
he
passed
and
also
in
crossing
the
johannapark
hardly
a
hint
of
september
was
in
the
air
he
walked
at
a
slow
pace
in
order
not
to
arrive
too
early
and
for
some
reason
unclear
to
himself
avoided
stepping
on
the
joins
of
the
on
hearing
that
he
had
not
come
for
a
lesson
the
dirty
maidservant
who
opened
the
door
to
him
showed
him
as
a
visitor
into
the
best
maurice
remained
standing
in
prescribed
fashion
but
he
had
no
sooner
crossed
the
threshold
than
he
was
aware
of
loud
voices
in
the
adjoining
room
separated
from
the
one
he
was
in
by
large
foldingdoors
if
you
think
said
a
woman
voice
and
broke
on
think
if
you
think
i
going
to
endure
a
repetition
of
what
happened
two
years
ago
you
mistaken
never
again
shall
she
enter
this
house
oh
you
pig
you
wretch
klara
has
told
me
she
saw
you
through
the
keyhole
with
your
arm
round
her
waist
and
i
know
myself
scarcely
a
note
was
struck
in
the
hour
you
have
her
here
on
any
pretext
you
keep
her
in
the
class
after
all
the
others
have
gone
but
this
time
i
not
going
to
sit
still
till
the
scandal
comes
out
and
she
has
to
leave
the
place
a
man
of
your
age
the
father
of
four
children
and
this
ugly
little
hussy
of
seventeen
was
there
ever
such
a
miserable
woman
as
i
am
no
she
shall
never
enter
this
house
again
and
i
say
she
shall
came
from
schwarz
so
fiercely
that
the
listener
started
are
you
ashamed
woman
at
your
age
to
set
a
servant
spying
at
keyholes
or
what
is
more
likely
spying
yourself
keep
to
your
kitchen
and
your
pots
and
do
dictate
to
me
i
am
the
master
of
the
house
not
in
a
case
like
this
it
concerns
me
it
concerns
the
children
i
say
she
shall
never
enter
the
door
again
and
i
say
she
shall
go
out
of
the
room
a
chair
grated
roughly
on
a
bare
floor
a
door
banged
with
such
violence
that
every
other
door
in
the
house
vibrated
in
the
silence
that
ensued
maurice
endeavoured
to
make
his
presence
known
by
walking
about
but
no
one
came
his
eyes
ranged
round
the
room
it
was
with
a
few
slight
differences
the
ordinary
best
room
of
the
ordinary
german
house
the
windows
were
heavily
curtained
and
in
front
of
them
to
the
further
exclusion
of
light
and
air
stood
respectively
a
laden
with
unlovely
green
plants
and
a
the
plush
furniture
was
stiffly
grouped
round
an
oblong
table
and
dotted
with
under
a
glass
shade
was
a
massy
bunch
of
wax
flowers
a
vertikow
decorated
with
shells
and
grasses
stood
cornerwise
beside
the
sofa
and
at
the
door
rose
white
and
gaunt
a
monumental
berlin
stove
but
in
addition
to
this
which
was
de
rigueur
there
were
personal
touches
on
the
walls
besides
the
usual
group
of
family
photographs
in
oval
frames
hung
the
copy
of
a
madonna
by
gabriel
max
two
etchings
after
defregger
several
large
of
schwarz
classes
in
different
years
a
framed
concert
programme
yellow
with
age
and
a
silhouette
of
schumann
over
one
of
the
doors
hung
a
withered
laurelwreath
of
imposing
dimensions
and
with
faded
silken
ends
on
which
the
inscription
was
still
legible
dem
grossen
kunstler
johannes
schwarz
open
on
a
chair
with
an
embroidered
between
its
pages
lay
atta
troll
and
by
the
stove
a
battered
wooden
doll
sat
against
the
wall
in
a
relaxed
attitude
with
a
set
leer
on
its
painted
face
maurice
waited
in
growing
embarrassment
he
had
unconsciously
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
doll
and
in
the
dead
silence
of
the
house
the
senseless
face
of
the
creature
ruffled
his
nerves
crossing
the
room
he
knocked
it
over
with
his
foot
so
that
its
head
fell
with
a
bump
on
the
parquet
floor
where
it
lay
in
a
still
more
tipsy
position
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
had
arrived
at
a
most
inopportune
moment
it
seemed
too
as
if
the
servant
had
forgotten
even
to
announce
him
on
cautiously
opening
the
door
with
the
idea
of
slipping
away
he
heard
a
child
screaming
in
a
distant
room
and
the
mother
voice
sharp
in
rebuke
the
servant
was
clattering
pots
and
pans
in
the
kitchen
but
she
heard
maurice
and
put
her
head
out
of
the
door
her
face
was
red
and
swollen
with
crying
what
you
still
here
she
said
rudely
i
forgotten
all
about
you
it
does
matter
another
time
murmured
maurice
but
the
girl
had
spoken
in
a
loud
voice
to
make
herself
heard
above
the
screaming
which
was
increasing
in
volume
and
at
her
words
a
door
at
the
end
of
the
passage
and
facing
down
it
was
opened
by
about
an
inch
and
frau
schwarz
peered
through
the
slit
who
is
it
the
servant
tossed
her
head
and
made
no
reply
she
went
back
into
her
kitchen
and
after
a
brief
absence
during
which
frau
schwarz
continued
surreptitiously
to
scrutinise
maurice
came
out
carrying
a
large
plateful
of
berliner
pfannkuchen
with
these
she
crossed
to
an
opposite
room
and
as
she
there
planked
the
plate
down
on
the
table
she
announced
the
visitor
a
surly
voice
muttered
something
in
reply
as
however
the
girl
insisted
in
her
sulky
way
on
the
length
of
time
the
young
man
had
waited
schwarz
called
out
stridently
well
then
in
god
name
let
him
come
in
and
klara
you
tell
my
wife
if
that
noise
is
stopped
i
throw
either
her
or
you
downstairs
klara
appeared
again
scarlet
with
anger
jerked
her
arm
at
maurice
to
signify
that
he
might
do
the
rest
for
himself
and
retreating
into
her
kitchen
slammed
the
door
left
thus
with
no
alternative
maurice
drew
his
heels
together
gave
the
customary
rap
and
went
into
the
room
schwarz
was
sitting
at
the
table
with
his
head
on
his
hand
tracing
the
pattern
of
the
cloth
with
the
blade
of
his
knife
a
stood
on
a
tray
before
him
he
had
just
refilled
his
cup
and
helped
himself
from
the
dish
of
pfannkuchen
which
freshly
baked
sent
an
inviting
odour
through
the
room
he
hardly
looked
up
on
entrance
and
cut
short
the
young
man
apologetic
beginnings
well
what
is
it
what
brings
you
here
as
maurice
hesitated
before
the
difficulty
of
plunging
offhand
into
the
object
of
his
visit
schwarz
pointed
with
his
knife
at
a
chair
he
could
not
speak
for
he
had
just
put
the
best
part
of
a
pfannkuchen
in
his
mouth
and
was
chewing
hard
maurice
sat
down
and
holding
his
hat
by
the
brim
proceeded
to
explain
that
he
had
called
on
a
small
personal
matter
which
would
not
occupy
more
than
a
minute
of
the
master
time
it
in
connection
with
last
night
that
i
wished
to
speak
to
you
herr
professor
he
said
the
title
which
was
not
schwarz
by
right
he
knew
to
be
a
sop
i
should
be
much
obliged
to
you
if
you
would
give
me
your
candid
opinion
of
my
playing
it
not
easy
to
judge
oneself
although
i
must
say
both
at
the
time
and
afterwards
i
was
not
too
well
pleased
with
what
i
had
done
that
is
to
say
wie
was
cried
schwarz
and
threw
a
hasty
glance
at
his
pupil
while
he
helped
himself
anew
from
the
dish
maurice
uncrossed
his
legs
and
crossed
them
again
the
same
one
up
my
time
here
comes
to
an
end
at
easter
herr
professor
and
important
for
me
to
learn
what
you
think
of
the
progress
i
have
made
since
being
with
you
i
do
know
why
he
added
less
surely
but
of
late
i
have
felt
satisfied
with
myself
i
seem
to
have
got
a
certain
length
and
to
have
stuck
there
i
should
like
to
know
if
you
have
noticed
it
too
if
so
does
the
fault
lie
with
my
want
of
talent
or
or
with
me
perhaps
broke
in
schwarz
who
had
with
difficulty
thus
far
restrained
himself
he
laughed
offensively
with
me
eh
he
struck
himself
on
the
chest
several
times
in
succession
with
the
of
his
knife
that
there
might
be
no
doubt
to
whom
he
referred
upon
my
soul
what
next
i
wonder
what
next
he
ceased
to
laugh
and
grew
ungovernably
angry
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
by
it
do
you
think
i
nothing
better
to
do
at
the
end
of
a
hard
work
than
to
sit
here
and
give
candid
opinions
and
discuss
the
progress
made
by
each
strummer
who
comes
to
me
twice
a
week
for
a
lesson
oho
if
you
are
of
that
opinion
you
may
disabuse
your
mind
of
it
i
at
your
service
on
tuesday
and
friday
afternoon
when
i
am
paid
to
be
otherwise
my
time
is
my
own
he
laid
two
of
the
cakes
on
top
of
each
other
sliced
them
through
and
put
one
of
the
pieces
thus
obtained
in
his
mouth
maurice
had
risen
and
stood
waiting
for
the
into
which
he
could
thrust
words
of
apology
i
beg
your
pardon
herr
professor
he
now
began
you
misunderstand
me
nothing
was
further
from
my
mind
than
but
schwarz
had
not
finished
speaking
he
rapped
the
table
with
his
and
working
himself
up
to
a
white
heat
continued
but
plain
and
plump
i
tell
you
this
herr
guest
he
pronounced
it
gvest
if
you
are
not
satisfied
with
me
and
my
teaching
you
at
liberty
to
try
some
one
else
if
this
is
a
preliminary
to
inscribing
yourself
under
that
miserable
humbug
that
wretched
charlatan
who
pretends
to
teach
the
piano
do
it
and
have
done
with
it
no
one
will
hinder
you
certainly
not
i
you
under
no
necessity
to
come
here
beforehand
and
apologise
and
give
your
reasons
none
of
the
others
did
slink
off
like
them
without
a
word
it
the
more
decent
way
in
the
long
run
they
at
least
knew
they
were
behaving
like
blackguards
you
have
completely
misunderstood
me
herr
schwarz
if
you
will
give
me
a
moment
to
explain
but
schwarz
was
in
no
mood
for
explanations
he
went
on
again
paying
no
heed
to
maurice
interruption
who
would
rather
break
stones
by
the
roadside
than
be
a
teacher
he
asked
and
sliced
and
ate
sliced
and
ate
look
at
the
years
of
labour
i
have
behind
me
twenty
and
more
in
which
i
toiled
to
the
best
of
my
ability
eight
and
nine
hours
day
after
day
and
eternally
for
ends
that
were
my
own
and
what
return
do
i
get
for
it
a
only
needs
to
wave
a
red
flag
before
them
and
all
alike
rush
blindly
to
him
a
pupil
of
liszt
bah
who
was
liszt
a
of
execution
a
perverter
of
taste
a
worthy
ally
of
that
upstart
who
ruined
melody
harmony
and
form
do
talk
to
me
of
liszt
he
spoke
in
spurts
blusteringly
but
indistinctly
owing
to
the
fullness
of
his
mouth
but
i
not
to
be
imposed
on
i
know
their
tricks
have
i
myself
had
pupils
turn
to
me
from
bulow
and
rubinstein
is
that
not
proof
enough
would
they
have
come
if
they
had
known
what
my
method
was
worth
and
i
took
them
and
spared
no
pains
to
make
something
of
them
have
i
a
right
to
expect
some
gratitude
from
them
in
return
gratitude
such
a
thing
does
exist
it
a
word
without
meaning
a
puffing
of
the
air
look
at
him
for
whom
i
did
more
than
for
all
the
rest
did
i
take
a
pfennig
from
him
in
payment
when
i
saw
that
he
had
talent
not
i
and
i
did
it
all
when
he
came
to
me
he
could
play
a
scale
i
gave
him
extra
lessons
without
charge
i
put
pupils
in
his
way
i
got
him
scholarships
i
enabled
him
to
support
his
family
they
would
have
been
beggars
in
the
street
but
for
me
and
now
soon
will
be
yes
i
have
had
his
mother
here
weeping
at
my
feet
imploring
me
to
reason
with
him
and
bring
him
back
to
his
senses
she
sees
where
his
infamy
will
land
them
but
i
i
snap
my
fingers
in
his
face
he
has
sown
and
he
shall
reap
his
but
the
day
will
come
i
know
it
when
he
will
return
to
me
and
all
the
rest
will
follow
him
like
the
sheep
they
are
let
them
come
they
see
then
whether
i
have
need
of
them
or
not
they
see
then
what
they
were
worth
to
me
for
i
can
produce
others
others
i
say
who
will
put
him
and
his
fellows
out
of
the
running
do
they
think
i
done
for
because
of
this
i
show
them
the
contrary
i
show
them
why
i
set
no
more
store
by
the
lot
of
you
than
i
do
by
this
plate
of
cakes
again
he
ate
voraciously
and
for
a
few
moments
the
noise
his
jaws
made
in
working
was
the
only
sound
in
the
room
maurice
stood
in
the
same
attitude
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
i
regret
more
than
i
can
express
having
been
the
cause
of
annoying
you
herr
professor
he
said
at
length
with
stiff
formality
but
i
should
like
to
repeat
once
more
that
my
only
object
in
coming
here
was
to
speak
to
you
about
last
night
i
felt
dissatisfied
with
myself
and
dissatisfied
echoed
schwarz
bringing
his
jaws
together
with
a
snap
and
what
business
of
yours
is
it
to
feel
dissatisfied
i
like
to
know
leave
that
to
me
you
hear
soon
enough
i
warrant
you
when
i
have
reason
to
be
dissatisfied
until
then
do
me
the
pleasure
of
minding
your
own
business
excuse
me
said
maurice
with
warmth
if
this
is
my
own
business
as
i
see
it
it
nobody
but
mine
and
it
seemed
to
me
natural
to
appeal
to
you
as
the
only
person
who
could
decide
for
me
whether
i
should
have
anything
further
to
do
with
art
or
whether
i
should
throw
it
up
altogether
schwarz
who
was
sometimes
not
averse
to
a
spirited
opposition
caught
at
the
one
unlucky
word
on
which
he
could
hang
his
scorn
art
he
repeated
with
jocose
emphasis
he
had
finished
the
plate
of
cakes
risen
from
the
table
and
was
picking
teeth
at
the
window
art
pooh
pooh
what
art
got
to
do
with
it
in
your
place
i
should
avoid
taking
such
highflown
words
on
my
tongue
call
it
something
else
do
you
think
it
makes
a
jot
of
difference
whether
you
call
it
art
or
pludderdump
not
so
much
and
he
snapped
his
fingers
will
be
changed
though
you
never
call
it
anything
vanity
it
nothing
but
vanity
a
set
of
raw
youths
inflate
themselves
like
frogs
and
have
opinions
on
art
as
on
what
they
have
eaten
for
their
do
your
work
and
hold
your
tongue
a
scale
well
played
is
worth
all
the
words
that
were
ever
said
and
that
the
majority
of
you
ca
do
he
closed
his
toothpick
with
a
snap
spat
dexterously
at
a
spittoon
which
stood
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
the
interview
was
over
as
maurice
descended
the
spiral
stair
he
said
to
himself
that
no
matter
how
long
he
remained
in
leipzig
he
would
never
trouble
schwarz
with
his
presence
again
the
man
was
a
bully
but
in
future
he
might
seek
out
others
to
be
the
butt
of
his
clumsy
wit
he
maurice
was
too
good
for
and
squaring
his
shoulders
he
walked
erectly
down
the
street
and
across
the
johannapark
but
none
the
less
he
did
not
go
straight
home
for
below
the
comedy
of
intolerance
at
which
he
was
playing
lurked
as
he
well
knew
the
consciousness
that
his
true
impression
of
the
past
hour
had
still
to
be
faced
he
might
postpone
doing
this
he
could
not
shirk
it
it
was
all
very
well
he
might
repeat
to
himself
that
he
had
happened
on
schwarz
at
an
inopportune
moment
that
did
not
count
for
him
maurice
the
opportune
moment
simply
did
not
exist
he
was
one
of
those
people
who
are
always
inopportune
come
and
go
as
they
will
he
might
have
waited
for
days
he
would
never
have
caught
schwarz
in
the
right
mood
or
in
the
nick
of
time
how
he
envied
those
fortunate
mortals
who
always
arrived
at
the
right
moment
and
instinctively
said
the
right
thing
that
talent
had
never
been
his
with
him
it
was
blunder
one
thing
though
that
still
perplexed
him
was
that
not
once
since
he
had
been
in
leipzig
had
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
that
native
goodness
of
heart
for
which
he
had
heard
schwarz
lauded
the
master
had
done
his
duty
by
him
nothing
more
neither
had
had
any
personal
feeling
for
the
other
and
the
words
schwarz
had
used
this
afternoon
had
only
been
the
outcome
of
a
long
period
of
reserve
even
of
distrust
at
this
moment
when
he
was
inclined
to
take
the
onus
of
the
misunderstanding
on
his
own
shoulders
maurice
admitted
besides
his
constant
preoccupation
or
possibly
just
because
of
it
an
innate
lack
of
sympathy
in
himself
an
inability
either
of
heart
or
of
imagination
to
project
himself
into
the
lives
and
feelings
of
people
he
did
not
greatly
care
for
otherwise
he
would
not
have
gone
to
schwarz
on
such
an
errand
as
today
he
would
have
remembered
that
the
master
was
likely
to
be
sore
and
suspicious
and
from
now
on
things
would
be
worse
instead
of
better
schwarz
had
no
doubt
been
left
under
the
impression
that
maurice
had
wished
to
complain
of
his
teaching
and
impressions
of
this
nature
were
difficult
to
erase
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
however
but
to
plod
along
in
the
familiar
rut
he
must
stomach
aspersions
and
injuries
behave
as
if
nothing
had
happened
his
first
hot
intention
of
turning
his
back
on
schwarz
soon
yielded
to
more
thoughts
every
practical
consideration
was
against
it
he
might
avenge
himself
if
he
liked
by
running
to
the
rival
teacher
like
a
crossed
child
schrievers
would
undoubtedly
receive
him
with
open
arms
and
promise
him
all
he
asked
but
what
could
he
hope
to
accomplish
under
a
complete
change
of
method
in
the
few
months
that
were
left
he
would
also
have
to
forfeit
his
fees
for
the
coming
term
which
were
already
paid
lessons
were
expensive
and
out
of
the
small
sum
that
remained
to
him
to
live
on
it
would
be
impossible
to
take
more
than
half
a
dozen
another
than
he
might
have
appealed
to
schrievers
satisfaction
in
securing
a
fresh
convert
but
maurice
had
learnt
too
thoroughly
by
now
that
he
was
not
one
of
those
happy
exceptions
exceptions
by
reason
of
their
talent
or
their
temperament
to
whom
a
master
was
willing
to
devote
his
time
free
of
charge
over
these
reflections
night
had
fallen
and
rising
he
walked
speedily
back
by
the
dark
but
before
he
reached
the
meadows
from
which
he
could
see
lights
blinking
in
the
scattered
villas
his
steps
had
lagged
again
his
discouragement
had
nothing
chimerical
in
it
at
this
moment
it
was
part
and
parcel
of
the
night
was
both
chilly
and
misty
and
it
was
late
but
a
painful
impression
of
the
previous
evening
lingered
in
his
mind
louise
would
be
annoyed
with
him
for
keeping
her
waiting
and
he
shrank
in
advance
from
the
thought
of
another
disagreeable
scene
he
was
not
in
the
mood
to
soothe
and
console
as
he
entered
the
mozartstrasse
he
saw
that
there
was
a
light
in
madeleine
window
she
was
at
home
then
he
imagined
her
sitting
quiet
and
busy
in
her
pleasant
room
which
except
for
the
ring
of
lamplight
was
sunk
in
peaceful
shadow
this
was
what
he
needed
an
hour
rest
dim
light
and
madeleine
sympathetic
tact
without
giving
himself
time
for
thought
he
mounted
the
stair
and
pressed
the
on
the
third
floor
on
seeing
who
her
visitor
was
madeleine
rose
with
alacrity
from
the
maurice
is
it
really
you
i
was
passing
i
thought
i
would
run
up
you
surprised
to
see
me
oh
well
you
a
stranger
now
you
know
she
was
vexed
with
herself
for
showing
astonishment
moving
some
books
she
made
room
for
him
to
sit
down
on
the
sofa
and
as
he
was
moody
and
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
state
why
he
had
come
she
asked
if
she
might
finish
the
letter
she
was
writing
make
yourself
comfortable
here
a
cushion
for
your
head
through
eyes
he
watched
her
hand
travelling
across
the
sheet
of
and
returning
at
regular
intervals
with
a
sure
swoop
to
begin
a
fresh
line
there
was
no
sound
except
the
gentle
scratching
of
her
pen
madeleine
did
not
look
up
till
she
had
finished
her
letter
and
addressed
the
envelope
maurice
had
shut
his
eyes
are
you
asleep
she
roused
him
or
only
tired
i
a
headache
i
make
you
some
tea
he
watched
her
preparing
it
and
by
the
time
she
handed
him
his
cup
he
was
in
the
right
mood
for
making
her
his
confidant
look
here
madeleine
he
said
i
came
up
the
fact
is
done
a
foolish
thing
and
i
want
to
talk
to
some
one
about
it
her
eyes
grew
more
alert
let
me
see
if
i
can
help
you
he
shook
his
head
i
afraid
you
ca
but
first
of
all
tell
me
frankly
how
you
thought
i
got
on
last
night
how
you
got
on
echoed
madeleine
unclear
what
this
was
to
lead
to
why
all
right
of
oh
well
if
you
insist
on
the
truth
the
fact
is
maurice
you
did
no
better
and
no
worse
than
the
majority
of
those
who
fill
the
abend
programmes
what
you
did
do
was
to
reach
the
standard
your
friends
had
set
up
for
you
thanks
now
listen
and
he
related
to
her
in
detail
his
misadventure
of
the
afternoon
madeleine
followed
with
close
attention
but
more
distinctly
than
what
he
said
she
heard
what
he
did
not
say
his
account
of
the
two
last
days
with
the
unintentional
sidelight
it
threw
on
just
those
parts
he
wished
to
keep
in
darkness
made
her
aware
how
complicated
and
involved
his
life
had
become
but
before
he
finished
speaking
she
brought
all
her
practical
intelligence
to
bear
on
what
he
said
maurice
she
exclaimed
with
a
consternation
that
was
three
parts
genuine
i
should
like
to
shake
you
how
could
you
what
induced
you
to
do
such
a
foolish
thing
and
as
he
did
not
speak
if
only
you
had
come
to
me
before
instead
of
after
i
should
have
said
hold
what
ridiculous
opinions
you
like
yourself
but
for
goodness
sake
keep
clear
of
schwarz
with
them
yes
ridiculous
and
offensive
too
anyone
would
have
taken
your
talk
about
being
dissatisfied
just
as
he
did
and
after
the
way
he
has
been
treated
of
late
he
of
course
doubly
touchy
i
knew
that
when
it
was
too
late
but
i
meant
merely
to
speak
straight
out
to
him
madeleine
one
man
to
another
you
surely
want
to
say
he
incapable
of
allowing
one
to
have
an
independent
opinion
if
that
the
case
then
he
nothing
but
the
wretched
little
tyrant
heinz
declares
him
to
be
wait
till
you
have
taught
as
long
as
he
has
said
madeleine
and
at
his
muttered
god
forbid
she
continued
with
more
warmth
know
then
too
that
it
does
matter
whether
your
pupils
have
opinions
or
not
he
has
seen
this
kind
of
thing
scores
of
times
before
and
knows
it
must
be
kept
down
she
paused
and
looked
at
him
to
get
on
in
life
one
must
have
a
certain
amount
of
tact
you
are
too
naive
maurice
too
unsuspecting
one
of
those
people
who
would
like
to
carry
on
social
intercourse
on
a
basis
of
absolute
truth
and
then
be
surprised
that
it
came
to
an
end
you
are
altogether
a
very
difficult
person
to
deal
with
you
are
either
too
candid
or
too
reserved
there
no
middle
way
in
you
i
have
the
least
doubt
that
schwarz
finds
you
both
perplexing
and
irritating
he
takes
the
candour
for
impertinence
and
the
reserve
for
distrust
maurice
smiled
faintly
go
on
do
spare
me
no
one
ever
troubled
before
to
tell
me
my
failings
oh
i
quite
in
earnest
as
i
look
at
it
it
entirely
your
own
fault
that
you
do
stand
better
with
schwarz
you
have
never
condescended
to
humour
him
as
you
ought
to
have
done
you
thought
it
was
enough
to
be
truthful
and
honest
and
to
leave
the
rest
to
him
well
it
was
i
wo
hear
a
word
against
schwarz
he
goodness
itself
to
those
who
deserve
it
a
little
bluff
and
rude
at
times
but
he
too
busy
to
go
about
in
kid
gloves
for
fear
of
hurting
sensitive
people
feelings
why
did
you
never
take
private
lessons
from
him
was
her
next
question
i
told
you
months
ago
you
remember
that
you
ought
oh
yes
you
said
they
were
too
expensive
i
know
but
you
could
have
scraped
a
few
marks
together
somehow
you
managed
to
buy
books
and
books
were
quite
unnecessary
one
lesson
a
fortnight
would
have
brought
you
more
into
touch
with
schwarz
than
all
you
have
had
in
the
class
as
it
is
you
do
know
him
any
better
than
he
knows
you
and
as
she
refilled
his
she
added
you
quoted
heinz
to
me
just
now
but
you
and
i
ca
afford
to
measure
people
by
the
same
standards
as
heinz
we
are
everyday
mortals
besides
in
all
that
counts
he
is
not
worth
schwarz
little
finger
you
a
warm
advocate
madeleine
yes
and
i
reason
to
be
no
one
here
has
been
as
kind
to
me
as
schwarz
i
came
a
complete
stranger
and
with
not
more
than
ordinary
talent
but
i
went
to
him
and
told
him
frankly
what
i
wanted
to
do
how
long
i
could
stay
and
how
much
money
i
had
to
spend
he
helped
me
and
advised
me
he
has
let
me
study
what
will
be
of
most
use
to
me
afterwards
and
he
takes
as
much
interest
in
my
future
as
i
do
myself
how
can
i
speak
anything
but
well
of
him
what
i
certainly
did
do
was
to
go
to
him
and
talk
ambiguously
about
feeling
dissatisfied
with
him
with
myself
madeleine
have
i
made
that
clear
but
madeleine
only
sniffed
well
it
over
and
done
with
now
she
said
after
a
pause
and
talking
about
it
wo
mend
tell
me
rather
what
you
intend
to
do
what
are
your
plans
plans
i
do
know
i
have
any
sufficient
unto
the
day
etc
but
of
this
she
disapproved
with
open
scorn
rubbish
when
your
time
here
is
all
but
up
and
no
plans
one
thing
i
can
tell
you
anyhow
is
after
you
need
rely
on
schwarz
for
assistance
spoilt
your
chances
with
him
the
only
way
of
repairing
the
mischief
would
be
the
lesson
i
spoke
of
one
a
week
as
long
as
you
re
here
i
could
afford
it
no
i
suppose
not
she
said
sarcastically
and
tore
a
piece
of
paper
that
came
under
her
fingers
into
narrow
strips
tell
me
she
added
a
moment
later
in
a
changed
tone
where
do
you
intend
to
settle
when
you
return
to
england
and
have
you
begun
to
think
of
advertising
yourself
yet
he
waved
his
hand
before
his
face
as
if
he
were
chasing
away
a
fly
for
god
sake
madeleine
these
alluring
prospects
pray
what
else
do
you
expect
to
do
well
the
truth
is
i
i
not
going
back
to
england
at
all
i
mean
to
settle
here
madeleine
repressed
the
exclamation
that
rose
to
her
lips
and
stooped
to
brush
something
off
the
skirt
of
her
dress
her
face
was
red
when
she
raised
it
she
needed
no
further
telling
she
understood
what
his
words
implied
as
clearly
as
though
it
were
printed
black
on
white
before
her
but
she
spoke
in
a
casual
tone
however
are
you
going
to
make
that
possible
he
endeavoured
to
explain
i
do
envy
you
she
said
drily
when
he
had
finished
you
hardly
realise
what
lies
before
you
i
think
there
are
people
here
who
are
glad
to
get
fifty
pfennigs
an
hour
for
piano
lessons
think
of
plodding
up
and
down
stairs
all
day
long
for
fifty
pfennigs
an
hour
he
was
silent
while
in
england
with
a
little
tact
and
patience
you
would
soon
have
more
pupils
than
you
could
take
at
five
shillings
tact
and
patience
mean
push
and
a
thick
skin
but
do
worry
i
shall
get
on
all
right
and
if
i
do
life
short
you
know
but
you
are
just
at
the
beginning
of
it
and
ridiculously
young
at
that
good
heavens
maurice
she
burst
out
unable
to
contain
herself
ca
you
see
that
after
you
been
at
home
again
for
a
little
while
things
that
have
seemed
so
important
here
will
have
shrunk
into
their
right
places
you
be
glad
to
have
done
with
them
then
when
you
are
in
orderly
circumstances
again
i
afraid
not
answered
the
young
man
i
not
a
good
forgetter
a
good
forgetter
repeated
madeleine
and
laughed
sarcastically
she
was
going
on
to
say
more
but
just
at
this
moment
a
clock
outside
struck
ten
and
maurice
sprang
to
his
feet
so
late
already
i
no
idea
i
must
be
off
she
stood
by
and
watched
him
look
for
his
hat
here
it
is
she
picked
it
up
and
handed
it
to
him
with
an
emphasised
want
of
haste
good
night
madeleine
thanks
for
the
truth
i
knew
i
could
depend
on
you
it
was
well
meant
and
the
truth
is
always
beneficial
you
know
good
come
again
soon
he
heard
her
last
words
down
the
stairs
which
he
took
two
at
a
time
the
hour
he
had
now
to
face
was
a
painful
ending
to
an
unpleasant
day
it
was
not
merely
the
fact
that
he
had
kept
louise
waiting
in
aching
suspense
for
several
hours
it
now
came
out
that
after
their
disagreement
of
the
previous
night
she
had
confidently
expected
him
to
return
to
her
early
in
the
day
had
expected
contrition
and
atonement
that
he
had
not
even
suspected
this
made
her
doubly
bitter
against
him
in
vain
he
tried
to
excuse
himself
to
offer
explanations
she
would
not
listen
to
him
nor
would
she
let
him
touch
her
she
tore
her
dress
from
between
his
fingers
brushed
his
hand
off
her
arm
and
retreating
into
a
corner
of
the
room
where
she
stood
like
an
animal
at
bay
she
poured
out
over
him
her
accumulated
resentment
all
she
had
ever
suffered
at
his
hands
all
the
infinitesimal
differences
there
had
been
between
them
from
the
beginning
the
fine
points
in
which
he
had
failed
things
of
which
he
had
no
knowledge
all
these
were
raked
up
and
cast
at
him
till
numb
with
pain
he
lost
even
the
wish
to
comfort
her
sitting
down
at
the
table
he
laid
his
head
on
his
folded
arms
at
his
feet
were
the
fragments
of
the
little
clock
which
in
her
anger
at
his
desertion
of
her
she
had
trodden
to
pieces
vi
their
first
business
the
next
morning
was
to
buy
another
clock
by
daylight
louise
was
full
of
remorse
at
what
she
had
done
and
in
passing
the
averted
her
eyes
they
went
out
early
to
a
shop
in
the
grimmaischestrasse
and
maurice
stood
by
and
watched
her
make
her
choice
she
loved
to
buy
and
entered
into
the
purchase
with
leisurely
enjoyment
the
shopman
and
his
assistant
spared
themselves
no
trouble
in
fetching
and
setting
out
their
wares
louise
handled
each
clock
as
it
was
put
before
her
discussed
the
merits
of
different
styles
and
a
faint
colour
mounted
to
her
cheeks
over
the
difficulty
of
deciding
between
two
which
she
liked
equally
well
she
had
pushed
up
her
veil
it
swathed
her
forehead
like
an
eastern
woman
her
eagerness
which
was
expressed
in
a
slight
unsteadiness
of
nostril
and
lip
would
have
had
something
childish
in
it
had
it
not
been
for
her
eyes
they
remained
heavy
and
unsmiling
and
the
disquieting
below
them
were
more
bluely
brown
than
ever
leaning
sideways
against
the
counter
maurice
looked
away
from
them
to
her
hands
her
fingers
were
entirely
without
ornament
and
he
would
have
liked
to
load
them
with
rings
as
it
was
he
could
not
even
pay
for
the
clock
she
chose
it
cost
more
than
he
had
to
spend
in
a
month
in
the
street
again
she
said
she
was
hungry
and
glad
to
be
able
to
add
his
mite
to
her
pleasure
he
took
her
by
the
arm
and
steered
her
to
the
cafe
francais
where
they
had
coffee
and
ices
the
were
booming
eleven
when
they
emerged
it
did
not
seem
worth
while
going
home
and
settling
down
to
work
instead
they
went
to
the
rosental
it
was
a
brilliant
autumn
day
rich
in
light
and
shade
and
there
was
only
a
breath
abroad
of
the
racy
freshness
that
meant
subsequent
decay
the
leaves
were
turning
red
and
orange
but
had
not
begun
to
fall
the
sky
was
deeply
blue
outlines
were
sharp
and
precise
they
were
both
in
a
mood
this
morning
to
be
susceptible
to
their
surroundings
they
were
even
eager
to
be
affected
by
them
and
made
happy
the
disagreements
of
the
two
preceding
nights
were
like
bad
dreams
which
they
were
anxious
to
forget
or
at
least
to
avoid
thinking
of
her
painful
unreasonable
treatment
of
him
the
evening
before
had
not
been
touched
on
between
them
after
his
incoherent
attempts
to
justify
himself
after
his
bitter
when
she
lay
sobbing
in
his
arms
they
had
both
with
one
accord
been
silent
neither
of
them
felt
any
desire
for
explanations
they
were
careful
not
to
stir
up
the
depths
anew
louise
was
very
quiet
had
it
not
been
for
her
eyes
he
might
have
believed
her
happy
but
here
just
as
an
hour
before
in
the
watchmaker
shop
they
brooded
unable
to
forget
and
yet
there
was
a
pliancy
about
her
this
morning
a
readiness
to
meet
his
wishes
which
as
he
walked
at
her
side
made
him
almost
content
the
old
foolish
dreams
awoke
in
him
again
and
vistas
opened
of
a
gentle
comradeship
which
might
still
come
true
when
the
strenuous
side
of
her
love
for
him
had
worn
itself
out
if
only
an
hour
like
the
present
could
have
lasted
indefinitely
it
was
a
happy
morning
they
ended
it
with
an
improvised
lunch
at
the
kaiserpark
and
it
remained
imprinted
on
their
minds
as
an
unexpected
patch
of
colour
in
an
unending
row
of
grey
days
given
up
to
duty
the
next
one
and
the
next
again
louise
continued
in
the
same
yielding
mood
which
was
wholly
different
from
the
emotional
expansiveness
of
the
past
weeks
maurice
took
a
glad
advantage
of
her
willingness
to
please
him
and
they
had
several
pleasant
walks
together
to
battlefields
along
the
grune
gasse
and
the
poetenweg
to
house
at
gohlis
and
into
the
heart
of
the
rosental
das
wilde
rosental
where
it
was
very
solitary
and
where
the
great
trees
seemed
to
stagger
under
their
load
of
stained
leaves
a
burst
of
almost
july
radiance
occurred
at
this
time
and
one
day
louise
expressed
a
wish
to
go
to
the
country
in
order
that
by
once
more
being
together
for
a
whole
day
on
end
they
might
relive
in
fancy
the
happy
weeks
they
had
spent
on
the
rochlitzer
berg
it
was
never
her
way
to
urge
which
made
it
hard
to
refuse
her
so
it
was
arranged
that
they
should
set
off
betimes
the
following
saturday
maurice
had
his
reward
in
the
cry
of
pleasure
she
gave
when
he
wakened
her
to
tell
her
that
it
was
a
fine
day
get
up
dear
it
less
than
an
hour
till
the
train
goes
for
the
first
time
for
weeks
louise
was
her
impetuous
self
again
she
threw
things
in
the
room
it
was
he
who
drew
her
attention
to
an
unfastened
hook
and
an
unbound
ribbon
she
only
pressed
forward
make
haste
oh
make
haste
we
shall
be
late
an
overpowering
smell
of
rolls
issued
from
the
shops
and
the
were
starting
out
with
their
baskets
women
and
were
coming
out
to
wash
pavements
and
entrances
the
collective
life
of
the
town
was
waking
up
to
another
uneventful
day
but
they
two
were
hastening
off
to
long
hours
of
sunlight
and
fresh
air
unhampered
by
the
passing
of
time
or
by
fallacious
ideas
of
duty
were
setting
out
for
a
new
bit
of
world
to
strange
meals
taken
in
strange
places
reached
by
white
roads
or
sequestered
in
the
train
they
were
crushed
between
the
baskets
of
the
marketwomen
who
were
journeying
from
one
village
to
another
these
sat
with
their
wizened
hands
clasped
on
their
high
stomachs
or
on
the
handles
of
their
baskets
and
stared
like
stupid
placid
animals
at
the
strange
young
foreign
couple
before
them
partly
for
the
frolic
of
astonishing
them
and
also
because
he
was
happy
at
seeing
louise
so
happy
maurice
kissed
her
hand
but
it
was
she
who
astonished
them
most
when
she
gave
a
cry
or
used
her
hands
with
a
sudden
vivid
effect
or
flashed
her
white
teeth
in
a
smile
every
head
in
the
carriage
was
turned
towards
her
and
when
in
addition
she
was
overtaken
by
a
fit
of
loquacity
she
was
devoured
by
eyes
they
did
not
travel
as
far
as
they
had
intended
from
the
carriage
window
she
saw
a
wayside
place
that
took
her
fancy
here
maurice
let
us
get
out
here
having
breakfasted
and
left
their
bags
at
an
inn
they
strayed
at
random
along
an
inviting
road
lined
with
when
louise
grew
tired
they
rested
in
the
arbour
of
a
primitive
gasthaus
and
ate
their
midday
meal
afterwards
in
a
wood
he
spread
a
rug
for
her
and
she
lay
in
a
nest
of
only
their
own
voices
broke
the
silence
then
she
fell
asleep
and
until
she
opened
her
eyes
again
and
called
to
him
in
surprise
no
sound
was
to
be
heard
but
the
sudden
crisp
rustling
of
some
bird
or
insect
when
evening
fell
they
returned
to
their
lodging
ate
their
supper
in
the
smoky
public
room
for
outside
mists
had
risen
and
then
before
them
stretched
undisturbed
the
long
evening
and
the
longer
night
to
be
spent
in
a
strange
room
of
which
they
had
hitherto
not
suspected
the
existence
but
which
from
now
on
would
be
indissolubly
bound
up
with
their
other
memories
the
first
day
passed
in
such
a
manner
was
as
flawless
as
any
they
had
known
in
the
height
of
summer
with
all
the
added
attractions
of
closer
intimacy
in
its
course
the
shadows
lifted
from
her
eyes
and
maurice
ceased
to
remember
that
he
had
made
a
mess
of
his
affairs
but
the
very
next
one
failed
as
far
as
louise
was
concerned
to
reach
the
same
level
it
was
like
a
flower
ever
so
slightly
overblown
the
lyric
charms
that
had
so
pleased
her
the
dewy
freshness
of
the
morning
the
solitude
the
unbroken
sunshine
were
frail
things
and
snatched
with
too
eager
a
hand
crumbled
beneath
the
touch
they
were
not
made
to
stand
the
wear
and
tear
of
repetition
it
was
also
impossible
she
found
to
live
through
again
days
such
as
they
had
spent
at
rochlitz
time
past
was
past
irrevocably
with
all
that
belonged
to
it
and
it
was
further
a
mistake
to
believe
that
a
more
intimate
acquaintance
meant
a
keener
pleasure
it
was
just
the
stimulus
of
strangeness
the
piquancy
of
feeling
one
way
that
had
made
up
half
the
fascination
of
the
summer
with
sure
instinct
louise
recognised
this
even
while
she
exclaimed
with
delight
and
her
heart
sank
not
until
this
moment
had
she
known
how
high
her
hopes
had
been
how
firmly
she
had
pinned
her
faith
upon
the
revival
of
passion
which
these
days
were
to
bring
to
pass
the
knowledge
that
this
had
been
a
delusion
was
hard
to
bear
in
thought
she
was
merciless
to
herself
when
on
waking
the
second
morning
she
looked
with
unexpectant
eyes
over
the
day
that
lay
before
her
could
nothing
satisfy
her
she
asked
herself
could
she
not
be
content
for
hours
on
end
was
it
eternally
her
lot
to
come
to
the
end
of
things
before
they
had
properly
begun
it
seemed
always
as
if
she
alone
must
be
pressing
forward
without
rest
here
on
the
second
of
these
days
of
love
and
sunshine
she
saw
with
absolute
clearness
that
neither
this
nor
any
other
day
had
anything
extraordinary
to
give
her
and
sitting
silent
at
dinner
under
an
arbour
of
creeper
she
was
overcome
by
such
a
laming
discouragement
that
she
laid
her
knife
and
fork
down
and
could
eat
no
more
maurice
watching
her
across
the
table
believed
that
she
was
and
filled
up
her
glass
with
wine
but
she
did
not
yield
without
a
struggle
and
it
was
not
merely
rebellion
against
the
defects
of
her
own
nature
which
prompted
her
the
prospect
of
the
coming
months
filled
her
with
dismay
when
this
last
brief
spell
of
pleasure
was
over
there
was
nothing
left
to
which
she
could
look
forward
the
approaching
winter
stretched
before
her
like
a
starless
night
she
was
afraid
to
let
her
mind
dwell
on
it
what
was
she
to
do
what
was
to
become
of
her
when
the
short
dark
days
came
down
again
and
shut
her
in
the
thought
of
it
almost
drove
her
mad
desperate
with
fear
she
shut
her
eyes
and
went
blindly
forward
determined
to
extract
every
particle
of
pleasure
or
at
least
of
oblivion
that
the
present
offered
under
these
circumstances
the
poor
human
element
in
their
relations
became
once
again
and
more
than
ever
before
the
pivot
on
which
their
lives
turned
louise
aimed
deliberately
at
bringing
this
about
further
she
did
what
she
had
never
yet
done
she
brought
to
bear
on
their
intercourse
all
her
own
hardwon
knowledge
and
all
her
arts
she
drew
from
her
store
of
experience
those
trifling
yet
weighty
details
which
once
she
has
learned
them
a
woman
never
forgets
and
in
addition
to
this
she
took
advantage
of
the
circumstances
in
which
they
found
themselves
utilising
to
the
full
the
stimulus
of
strange
times
and
places
she
fired
the
excitement
that
lurked
in
surreptitious
embrace
and
surrender
under
all
the
dangers
of
a
possible
surprise
she
was
perverse
and
capricious
she
would
turn
away
from
him
till
she
reduced
him
to
despair
then
to
yield
suddenly
with
a
completeness
that
threatened
to
undo
them
both
her
devices
were
not
that
they
were
necessary
for
he
was
helpless
in
her
hands
when
she
assumed
the
mastery
but
she
could
not
afford
to
omit
one
of
the
means
to
her
end
for
she
had
herself
to
lash
as
well
as
him
and
so
once
more
as
at
the
very
beginning
hand
grew
to
be
a
weight
in
hand
something
alive
electric
and
any
chance
contact
might
rouse
a
blast
in
them
she
neither
asked
nor
showed
mercy
drop
by
drop
they
drained
each
other
of
vitality
two
sufferers
yet
each
thirsty
for
the
for
with
this
new
attitude
on
her
part
an
element
of
cruelty
had
entered
into
their
love
when
with
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
her
insatiable
lips
apart
louise
put
back
her
head
and
looked
at
him
maurice
was
acutely
aware
of
the
hostile
feeling
in
her
but
he
too
knew
what
it
was
for
when
he
tried
to
urge
prudence
on
her
she
only
laughed
at
him
and
this
low
reckless
laugh
her
savage
eyes
and
morbid
pallor
invariably
took
from
him
every
jot
of
concern
they
returned
to
leipzig
towards
the
middle
of
the
first
week
in
order
not
to
make
their
absence
too
conspicuous
but
they
had
arranged
to
go
away
again
on
the
following
saturday
and
in
the
present
state
of
things
the
few
intervening
days
seemed
endless
louise
shut
herself
up
and
would
see
little
of
him
the
next
week
and
the
next
again
were
spent
in
the
same
fashion
a
fine
and
mild
october
ran
its
course
for
the
fourth
journey
towards
the
end
of
the
month
they
had
planned
to
return
to
rochlitz
at
the
last
moment
however
maurice
opposed
the
scheme
and
they
left
the
train
at
grimma
it
was
friday
and
a
superb
autumn
day
they
put
up
not
in
the
town
itself
but
at
an
inn
about
a
mile
and
a
half
distant
from
it
this
stood
on
the
edge
of
a
wood
was
a
favourite
summer
resort
and
had
lately
been
enlarged
by
an
additional
wing
now
it
was
empty
of
guests
save
themselves
they
occupied
a
large
room
in
the
new
part
of
the
building
at
the
end
of
a
long
corridor
which
was
shut
off
by
a
door
from
the
rest
of
the
house
they
were
utterly
alone
there
was
no
need
for
them
even
to
moderate
their
voices
in
the
early
morning
hours
and
on
the
journey
there
maurice
had
thought
he
noticed
something
unusual
about
louise
and
more
than
once
he
had
asked
her
if
her
head
ached
but
soon
he
forgot
his
solicitude
next
morning
he
felt
an
irresistible
inclination
to
go
out
opening
the
window
he
leaned
on
the
sill
a
fresh
pleasant
breeze
was
blowing
it
bent
the
tops
of
the
pines
and
drove
the
white
clouds
smoothly
over
the
sky
he
suggested
that
they
should
walk
to
the
ruined
cloister
of
nimbschen
but
louise
responded
very
languidly
and
he
had
to
coax
and
persuade
by
the
time
she
was
ready
to
leave
the
untidy
room
the
morning
was
more
than
half
over
and
the
shifting
clouds
had
balled
themselves
into
masses
before
the
two
emerged
from
the
wood
an
even
network
of
cloud
had
been
drawn
over
the
whole
sky
it
looked
like
rain
they
walked
as
usual
in
silence
little
or
nothing
being
left
to
say
that
seemed
worth
the
exertion
of
speech
each
step
cost
louise
a
visible
effort
her
arms
hung
slack
at
her
sides
her
very
hands
felt
heavy
the
pallor
of
her
face
had
a
greyish
tinge
in
it
maurice
began
to
regret
having
hurried
her
out
against
her
will
they
were
on
a
narrow
path
skirting
a
wood
when
she
suddenly
expressed
a
wish
for
some
tall
bulrushes
that
grew
beside
a
stream
some
distance
below
maurice
went
down
to
the
edge
of
the
water
and
began
to
cut
the
rushes
but
the
ground
was
marshy
and
the
finest
were
beyond
his
reach
on
the
path
at
the
top
of
the
bank
louise
stood
and
followed
his
movements
she
watched
his
ineffectual
efforts
to
seize
the
further
reeds
saw
how
they
slipped
back
from
between
his
hands
she
watched
him
take
out
his
knife
and
open
it
endeavour
once
more
to
reach
those
he
wanted
and
still
unsuccessful
choose
a
dry
spot
to
sit
down
on
saw
him
take
off
his
boots
and
stockings
then
rise
and
go
cautiously
out
on
the
soft
ground
ages
seemed
to
pass
while
she
watched
him
do
these
trivial
things
she
felt
as
if
she
were
gradually
turning
to
stone
as
she
stood
how
long
he
was
about
it
how
deliberately
he
moved
and
she
had
the
odd
sensation
too
that
she
knew
beforehand
everything
he
would
and
would
not
do
just
as
if
she
had
experienced
it
already
his
movements
were
of
an
impossible
circumstantiality
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
trifling
service
she
had
asked
of
him
for
at
heart
she
cared
as
little
about
the
rushes
as
about
anything
else
but
it
was
an
unfortunate
habit
of
his
and
one
she
noticed
more
and
more
as
time
went
on
to
make
much
of
paltry
details
which
properly
should
have
been
dismissed
without
a
second
thought
it
implied
a
certain
tactlessness
to
underline
the
obvious
in
this
fashion
the
very
way
for
instance
he
stretched
out
his
arm
unclasped
his
knife
leant
forward
and
then
stooped
back
to
lay
the
cut
reeds
on
the
bank
oh
she
was
tired
tired
to
exasperation
of
his
ways
and
actions
as
tired
as
she
was
of
his
words
and
of
the
thousand
and
one
occurrences
daily
repeated
that
made
up
their
lives
she
would
have
liked
to
creep
away
to
hide
herself
in
an
utter
seclusion
while
instead
it
was
her
lot
to
assist
hour
after
hour
at
making
much
of
what
in
the
depths
of
her
soul
did
not
concern
her
at
all
nothing
she
felt
would
ever
really
concern
her
again
she
gazed
fixedly
before
her
at
him
too
but
without
seeing
him
till
her
sight
was
blurred
trees
and
sky
stream
and
rushes
swam
together
in
a
formless
maze
and
all
of
a
sudden
while
she
was
still
blind
there
ran
through
her
such
an
intense
feeling
of
aversion
such
a
complete
satedness
with
all
she
had
of
late
felt
and
known
that
she
involuntarily
took
a
step
backwards
and
pressed
her
palms
together
in
order
to
hinder
herself
from
screaming
aloud
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
in
a
flash
she
grasped
that
she
was
unable
utterly
unable
to
face
the
day
that
was
before
her
she
knew
in
advance
every
word
every
look
and
embrace
that
it
held
for
her
rather
than
undergo
them
afresh
she
would
throw
herself
into
the
water
at
her
feet
anywhere
anywhere
only
to
get
away
to
be
alone
to
cover
her
face
and
see
no
more
her
hand
went
to
her
throat
her
breath
refused
to
come
she
shivered
so
violently
that
she
was
afraid
she
would
fall
to
the
ground
maurice
all
unsuspecting
sat
with
his
back
to
her
and
laced
his
boots
but
he
was
startled
into
an
exclamation
when
he
climbed
the
bank
and
saw
the
state
she
was
in
louise
good
heavens
what
the
matter
are
you
ill
he
took
her
by
the
arm
and
shook
her
a
little
to
arrest
her
attention
maurice
no
her
voice
was
hoarse
oh
let
me
go
home
he
repeated
the
words
in
amazed
alarm
but
what
is
it
darling
are
you
ill
are
you
cold
that
you
trembling
like
this
no
yes
oh
i
want
to
go
home
back
to
leipzig
why
of
course
if
you
want
to
at
once
the
rushes
lay
forgotten
on
the
ground
without
further
words
they
hastened
to
the
inn
there
maurice
helped
her
to
throw
her
things
into
the
bag
she
had
not
wholly
unpacked
and
having
paid
the
bill
led
her
with
the
same
feverish
haste
through
the
woods
and
town
to
the
he
was
full
of
distressed
concern
for
her
but
hardly
dared
to
show
it
for
to
all
his
questions
she
only
shook
her
head
walking
at
his
side
she
dug
her
nails
into
her
palms
till
she
felt
the
blood
come
in
her
effort
to
conceal
and
stifle
the
waves
of
almost
physical
repugnance
that
passed
through
her
making
it
impossible
for
her
to
bear
even
the
touch
of
his
hand
in
the
train
she
leaned
back
in
the
corner
and
shutting
her
eyes
pretended
to
be
asleep
they
took
a
droschke
home
the
driver
whipped
up
his
horse
the
landlady
was
called
in
to
make
the
first
fire
of
the
season
louise
went
to
bed
at
once
she
wanted
nothing
she
said
but
to
lie
still
in
the
darkened
room
he
should
go
away
she
preferred
to
be
alone
no
she
was
not
ill
only
tired
but
so
tired
that
she
could
not
keep
her
eyes
open
she
needed
rest
tomorrow
she
would
be
all
right
again
he
should
please
please
leave
her
and
go
away
and
turning
her
face
to
the
wall
she
drew
the
bedclothes
over
her
head
at
his
wits
end
to
know
what
it
all
meant
maurice
complied
but
at
home
in
his
room
he
could
settle
to
nothing
he
trembled
at
every
footstep
on
the
stair
no
message
came
however
and
when
he
had
seen
her
again
that
evening
he
felt
more
reassured
it
nothing
really
nothing
i
only
tired
yes
it
was
too
much
just
let
me
be
maurice
till
and
she
shut
her
eyes
again
and
kept
them
shut
till
she
heard
the
door
close
behind
him
he
was
reassured
but
still
for
the
greater
part
of
the
night
he
lay
sleepless
he
was
always
agitated
anew
by
the
abrupt
way
in
which
louise
passed
from
mood
to
mood
but
this
was
something
different
he
could
not
understand
it
in
the
morning
however
he
saw
things
in
a
less
tragic
light
and
on
sitting
down
to
the
piano
he
experienced
almost
a
sense
of
satisfaction
at
the
prospect
of
an
undisturbed
work
meanwhile
louise
shrank
even
in
memory
from
the
feverish
weeks
just
past
as
she
had
shrunk
that
day
from
his
touch
and
she
struggled
to
keep
her
thoughts
from
dwelling
on
them
but
it
was
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
she
felt
a
like
shame
and
regret
and
she
could
not
rid
her
mind
of
the
haunting
images
she
knew
the
reason
too
darkness
brought
the
knowledge
she
had
believed
had
wished
to
believe
that
the
failure
was
her
fault
a
result
of
her
unstable
nature
whereas
the
whole
undertaking
had
been
merely
a
futile
attempt
to
bolster
up
the
impossible
to
stave
off
the
inevitable
to
postpone
the
end
and
it
had
all
been
in
vain
the
end
it
would
come
as
surely
as
day
followed
night
had
perhaps
indeed
already
come
for
how
else
could
the
nervous
aversion
be
explained
which
had
seized
her
that
day
what
during
the
foregoing
weeks
she
had
tried
not
to
hear
what
had
sounded
in
her
ears
like
the
tone
of
a
sunken
bell
was
there
at
last
horrible
and
deafening
she
had
ceased
to
care
for
him
and
ceased
surfeited
with
abundance
with
the
same
vehement
abruptness
as
she
had
once
begun
the
swiftness
with
which
things
had
swept
to
a
conclusion
had
confessedly
been
accelerated
by
her
unhappy
temperament
but
however
gentle
the
gradient
the
point
for
which
they
made
would
have
remained
the
same
what
she
was
now
forced
to
recognise
was
that
the
whole
affair
had
been
no
more
than
an
episode
and
the
fact
of
its
having
begun
less
brutally
than
others
had
not
made
it
a
whit
better
able
than
these
to
withstand
decay
a
bitter
sense
of
humiliation
came
over
her
what
was
she
not
a
week
ago
she
could
count
the
days
on
her
fingers
the
mere
touch
of
his
hand
on
her
hair
had
made
her
thrill
and
now
the
sole
feeling
she
was
conscious
of
was
one
of
dislike
she
looked
back
over
the
course
of
her
relations
with
him
and
many
things
unclear
before
became
plain
to
her
she
had
gone
into
the
intimacy
deliberately
with
open
eyes
knowing
that
she
cared
for
him
only
in
a
friendly
way
she
had
believed
then
that
the
gift
of
herself
would
mean
little
to
her
while
it
would
secure
her
a
friend
and
companion
and
then
too
she
might
as
well
be
quite
honest
with
herself
she
had
nourished
a
romantic
hope
that
a
love
which
commenced
as
did
this
shy
adoring
tenderness
would
give
her
something
finer
and
more
enduring
than
she
had
hitherto
known
wrong
all
wrong
from
beginning
to
end
it
had
been
no
better
than
those
loves
which
made
no
secret
of
their
aim
and
did
not
strut
about
draped
in
false
sentiment
the
end
of
all
was
one
and
the
same
but
besides
this
it
had
come
to
mean
more
to
her
than
she
had
ever
dreamt
of
allowing
you
could
not
play
with
fire
it
seemed
and
not
be
burned
or
at
least
she
could
not
she
was
branded
with
wounds
the
fierce
demands
in
her
over
which
she
had
no
control
had
once
more
reared
their
heads
and
got
the
mastery
of
her
and
of
him
too
there
had
been
no
chance
beneath
their
scorching
breath
for
a
pallid
delicacy
of
feeling
it
did
not
cross
her
mind
that
she
would
conceal
what
she
felt
from
him
secrecy
implied
a
mental
ingenuity
a
tiresome
care
of
word
and
deed
his
eyes
must
be
opened
he
too
must
learn
to
say
the
horrid
word
end
how
infinitely
thankful
she
had
now
reason
to
be
that
she
had
not
yielded
to
his
persuasions
and
married
him
no
she
had
never
seriously
considered
the
idea
even
at
the
height
of
her
folly
but
then
she
was
never
quite
sure
of
herself
there
was
always
a
chance
that
some
blind
impulse
would
spring
up
in
her
and
overthrow
her
resolutions
now
he
must
suffer
too
and
rightly
for
after
all
he
had
also
been
to
blame
if
only
he
had
not
importuned
her
so
persistently
if
only
he
had
let
her
alone
nothing
of
this
would
have
happened
and
there
would
be
no
reason
for
her
to
lie
and
taunt
herself
but
in
his
silent
obstinate
way
he
had
given
her
no
peace
and
you
could
not
she
could
not
go
on
living
unmoved
at
the
side
of
a
person
who
was
crazy
with
love
for
you
for
two
nights
she
slept
little
on
the
third
worn
out
she
fell
soon
after
midnight
into
a
deep
sleep
from
which
the
following
morning
she
wakened
refreshed
when
maurice
came
about
twelve
her
eyes
followed
him
with
a
new
curiosity
as
he
drew
up
a
chair
and
sat
down
at
her
bedside
she
wondered
what
he
would
say
when
he
knew
and
what
change
would
come
over
his
face
but
she
made
no
beginning
to
enlightening
him
in
his
presence
she
was
seized
by
an
ungovernable
desire
to
be
distracted
to
be
taken
out
of
herself
also
it
was
not
she
began
to
grasp
a
case
of
stating
a
simple
fact
in
simple
words
it
meant
all
the
circumstantiality
of
complicated
explanation
it
meant
a
still
more
murderous
tearing
up
of
emotion
and
besides
this
there
was
another
factor
to
be
reckoned
with
and
that
was
the
peculiar
mood
he
was
in
for
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
room
she
felt
that
he
was
different
from
what
he
had
been
the
day
before
she
heard
the
irritation
in
his
voice
as
he
tried
to
persuade
her
to
come
out
to
dinner
with
him
in
fancy
she
saw
it
all
saw
them
walking
together
to
the
restaurant
at
a
brisk
pace
in
order
to
waste
none
of
his
valuable
time
saw
dinner
taken
quickly
for
the
same
reason
saw
them
parting
again
at
the
then
herself
in
the
room
alone
straying
from
sofa
to
window
and
back
again
through
the
long
hours
of
the
long
afternoon
a
kind
of
mental
nausea
seized
her
at
the
thought
that
the
old
round
was
to
begin
afresh
she
brought
no
answer
over
her
lips
and
after
waiting
some
time
in
vain
for
her
to
speak
maurice
rose
and
still
under
the
influence
of
his
illhumour
drew
up
the
three
blinds
and
opened
a
window
a
cold
dusty
sunlight
poured
into
the
room
louise
gave
a
cry
and
put
her
hands
to
her
eyes
the
room
is
so
close
and
you
so
pale
he
said
in
selfexcuse
do
you
know
you
been
shut
up
in
here
for
three
days
now
my
head
aches
it
will
never
be
any
better
as
long
as
you
lie
there
dearest
what
is
it
what
the
matter
with
you
you
unhappy
about
something
he
went
on
a
moment
later
what
is
it
wo
you
tell
me
nothing
she
murmured
she
lay
and
pressed
her
palms
to
her
eyeballs
so
firmly
that
when
she
removed
them
the
room
was
a
blur
maurice
standing
at
the
window
beat
a
tattoo
on
the
pane
then
with
his
back
to
her
he
began
to
speak
he
blamed
himself
for
what
he
called
the
folly
of
the
past
weeks
i
gave
way
when
i
should
have
been
firm
and
this
is
the
result
you
have
got
into
a
nervous
morbid
state
but
nonsense
to
think
it
can
go
on
for
the
first
time
she
was
conscious
of
a
somewhat
critical
attitude
on
his
part
he
said
folly
and
nonsense
but
she
made
no
comment
she
lay
and
let
his
words
go
over
her
they
had
so
little
import
now
all
the
words
that
had
ever
been
said
could
not
alter
a
jot
of
what
she
felt
of
her
intense
inward
experience
her
protracted
silence
her
heavy
indifference
infected
him
and
for
some
time
the
only
sound
to
be
heard
was
that
of
his
fingers
drumming
on
the
glass
when
he
spoke
again
he
seemed
to
be
concluding
an
argument
with
himself
and
indeed
on
this
particular
day
maurice
found
it
hard
to
detach
his
thoughts
from
himself
for
any
length
of
time
it
no
use
dear
things
ca
go
on
like
this
any
longer
i
got
to
buckle
down
to
work
again
i
i
i
have
told
you
yet
schwarz
is
letting
me
play
the
mendelssohn
she
thought
she
would
have
to
cry
aloud
here
it
was
again
the
chilling
atmosphere
of
commonplace
which
her
nerves
were
expected
to
live
and
be
well
in
the
phrases
the
must
this
and
must
that
the
confident
expectation
of
interest
in
doings
that
did
not
interest
her
at
all
she
could
not
it
would
kill
her
to
begin
it
anew
and
in
spite
of
her
efforts
at
repression
an
exclamation
forced
its
way
through
her
lips
at
this
maurice
went
quickly
back
to
her
forgive
me
talking
about
myself
when
you
are
not
well
he
knelt
down
beside
the
bed
and
removed
her
hands
from
her
face
she
did
not
open
her
eyes
kept
quite
still
at
this
moment
she
felt
mainly
curious
would
the
strange
aversion
to
his
touch
return
he
was
kissing
her
palms
pressing
them
to
his
face
she
drew
a
long
deep
sigh
it
did
not
come
back
on
the
contrary
the
touch
of
his
hand
was
pleasant
to
her
he
stroked
her
cheek
pushed
back
a
loose
piece
of
hair
from
her
forehead
and
as
he
did
this
she
was
aware
of
the
old
sense
of
beneath
his
hand
irksome
thoughts
fell
away
backwards
and
forwards
it
travelled
as
gently
as
though
she
were
a
sick
person
and
little
by
little
so
gradually
that
at
first
she
herself
was
not
conscious
of
them
other
wishes
came
to
life
in
her
again
she
began
to
desire
more
than
mere
peace
the
craving
came
over
her
to
forget
her
and
to
forget
them
in
a
dizzy
whirl
reaching
up
she
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
drew
him
down
he
kissed
her
eyelids
at
this
she
opened
her
eyes
enveloping
him
in
a
look
he
had
learnt
to
know
well
for
a
second
he
sustained
it
his
life
was
concentrated
in
the
liquid
fire
of
these
eyes
in
these
eager
parted
lips
she
pressed
them
to
his
and
he
felt
a
smart
like
a
sting
with
a
jerk
he
thrust
her
arms
away
and
rose
to
his
feet
to
keep
his
balance
he
was
obliged
to
grasp
the
back
of
a
chair
taking
out
his
handkerchief
he
pressed
it
to
his
lip
maurice
it
late
i
must
go
i
must
work
i
tell
you
he
stood
staring
at
the
drop
of
blood
on
his
handkerchief
maurice
he
looked
round
him
in
a
confused
way
he
was
strangely
angry
and
hasty
to
no
purpose
wo
you
then
you
wo
come
out
with
me
maurice
the
word
was
a
cry
oh
it
foolish
you
do
know
what
you
doing
he
had
found
his
coat
and
was
putting
it
on
with
unsure
hands
then
if
this
evening
then
as
usual
i
come
as
usual
the
door
shut
behind
him
a
minute
later
the
banged
at
the
sound
louise
seemed
to
waken
starting
up
in
bed
she
threw
a
wild
look
round
the
empty
room
then
turned
on
her
face
and
bit
a
hole
in
the
linen
of
the
pillow
maurice
worked
that
afternoon
as
though
his
future
was
conditioned
by
the
number
of
hours
he
could
practise
before
evening
throughout
these
three
days
indeed
his
zeal
had
been
unabating
he
would
never
have
yielded
so
calmly
to
the
morbid
fashion
in
which
she
had
cooped
herself
up
had
not
the
knowledge
that
his
time
was
his
own
again
been
something
of
a
relief
to
him
yes
at
first
relief
was
the
word
for
what
he
felt
for
after
making
one
good
resolution
on
top
of
another
he
had
when
the
time
came
again
been
a
willing
defaulter
he
had
allowed
the
chance
to
slip
of
making
good
by
redoubled
diligence
his
foolish
mistake
with
regard
to
schwarz
now
it
was
too
late
though
the
master
had
let
him
have
his
way
in
the
choice
of
piece
for
the
coming
prufung
it
had
mainly
been
owing
to
indifference
if
only
he
did
not
prove
unequal
to
the
choice
now
it
was
made
for
that
he
was
out
of
the
rut
of
steady
work
was
clear
to
him
as
soon
as
he
put
his
hands
to
the
piano
but
he
had
never
been
so
forlornly
energetic
as
on
this
particular
afternoon
yet
there
was
something
mechanical
too
about
his
playing
neither
heart
nor
brain
was
in
it
mendelssohn
effective
roulades
ran
thoughtlessly
from
his
fingers
in
the
course
of
a
single
day
he
had
come
to
feel
a
deep
contempt
for
the
emptiness
of
these
runs
and
flourishes
he
pressed
forward
however
hour
after
hour
without
a
break
as
though
he
were
a
machine
wound
up
for
the
purpose
but
with
the
entrance
of
dusk
his
fictitious
energy
collapsed
he
did
not
even
trouble
to
light
the
lamp
but
throwing
himself
on
the
sofa
covered
his
eyes
with
his
arm
the
twilight
induced
sensations
like
itself
vague
formless
intolerable
a
sudden
recognition
of
the
uselessness
of
human
striving
grew
up
in
him
with
the
rapidity
of
a
fungus
effort
and
work
ambition
and
success
alike
led
nowhere
were
so
many
blind
alleys
ambition
ended
in
smoke
success
was
a
fleeing
phantom
which
one
sought
in
vain
to
grasp
to
the
great
mass
of
mankind
it
was
more
than
immaterial
whether
one
of
its
units
toiled
or
no
not
a
single
soul
was
benefited
by
it
most
certainly
not
the
toiler
himself
it
was
only
given
to
a
few
to
achieve
anything
the
rest
might
stand
aside
early
in
the
day
nothing
of
their
labours
would
remain
except
the
scars
they
themselves
bore
he
was
unhappy
he
knew
it
with
a
painful
clearness
the
shock
had
been
too
rude
for
him
change
had
to
be
prepared
to
come
gradually
sooner
or
later
no
doubt
he
would
right
himself
again
but
in
the
meantime
his
plight
was
a
sorry
one
it
was
his
duty
to
protect
himself
against
another
onslaught
of
the
kind
to
protect
them
both
for
there
was
no
blinking
the
fact
a
few
more
weeks
like
the
foregoing
and
they
would
have
been
two
of
the
wretchedest
creatures
on
earth
they
were
miserable
enough
as
it
was
he
in
his
she
in
her
own
way
it
must
never
happen
again
she
too
had
doubtless
become
sensible
of
this
in
the
course
of
the
past
three
days
but
had
she
could
he
say
that
what
had
she
thought
what
had
she
felt
and
he
told
himself
that
was
just
what
he
would
never
know
he
saw
her
as
she
had
lain
that
morning
her
arms
long
and
white
on
the
coverlet
he
recalled
all
he
had
said
and
tried
to
piece
things
together
an
inner
meaning
seemed
to
be
eluding
him
again
in
memory
he
heard
the
cry
that
had
drawn
him
to
her
side
felt
her
hands
in
his
the
springy
resistance
of
her
hair
the
delicate
skin
of
her
eyelids
then
he
had
not
understood
the
sudden
impulse
that
had
made
him
spring
to
his
feet
but
now
as
he
lay
in
the
dusk
and
summed
up
these
things
a
new
thought
or
hardly
a
thought
so
much
as
an
intuition
flashed
through
his
mind
instantly
to
take
entire
possession
of
him
just
as
if
it
had
all
along
been
present
in
waiting
simultaneously
the
colour
mounted
to
his
face
he
refused
to
harbour
such
a
thought
and
put
it
from
him
angry
with
himself
but
it
was
not
to
be
kept
down
it
rose
again
in
an
inexplicable
way
this
suggestion
which
was
like
a
slur
cast
on
her
why
he
demanded
of
himself
should
it
not
have
occurred
to
him
before
once
twenty
a
hundred
times
for
the
same
thing
had
often
happened
times
without
number
she
had
striven
to
keep
him
at
her
side
was
its
presence
a
result
of
his
aimless
irritation
or
was
it
because
after
holding
him
at
arm
length
for
three
whole
days
she
had
asked
on
returning
to
him
neither
affection
nor
comradeship
only
the
blind
gratification
of
sense
he
did
not
know
but
forgotten
hints
and
trifles
words
acts
looks
which
he
had
never
before
considered
consciously
now
recurred
to
him
as
damning
evidence
with
his
arm
still
across
his
eyes
he
lay
and
let
it
work
in
him
let
doubts
and
frightful
uncertainties
grow
up
in
his
brain
suffered
the
most
horrible
suffering
of
all
doubt
of
the
one
beloved
he
seemed
to
be
looking
at
things
from
a
new
point
seeing
them
in
different
proportions
all
his
own
poor
hopes
and
beliefs
as
well
and
while
the
spasm
of
distrust
lasted
he
felt
inclined
to
doubt
whether
she
had
ever
really
cared
for
him
he
even
questioned
his
own
feeling
for
her
seeking
to
discover
whether
it
too
had
not
been
based
on
a
mere
sensual
fancy
he
saw
them
satisfying
an
instinct
without
reason
and
without
nobility
and
by
this
light
he
read
a
reason
for
the
past
months
which
made
him
groan
aloud
he
rose
and
paced
the
room
if
what
he
was
thinking
of
her
were
true
then
it
would
be
better
for
both
their
sakes
if
he
never
saw
her
again
but
even
while
he
said
this
he
knew
that
he
would
have
to
see
her
and
without
loss
of
time
what
he
needed
was
to
stand
face
to
face
with
her
to
look
into
her
eyes
which
whatever
they
might
do
had
never
learned
to
hide
the
truth
and
there
gain
the
certainty
that
his
imaginings
were
monstrous
the
phantoms
of
a
melancholy
october
twilight
it
was
nearly
nine
but
there
was
no
light
in
her
room
he
pictured
her
lying
in
the
dark
and
was
filled
with
remorse
but
he
said
her
name
in
vain
the
room
was
empty
lighting
the
lamp
he
saw
that
the
bedclothes
had
been
thrown
back
over
the
of
the
unmade
bed
as
though
she
had
only
just
left
it
the
landlady
said
that
she
had
gone
out
two
hours
previously
without
leaving
any
message
all
he
could
do
was
to
sit
down
and
wait
and
in
the
long
that
now
went
by
the
black
thoughts
that
had
driven
him
there
were
forgotten
his
only
wish
was
to
have
her
safe
beside
him
again
towards
ten
he
heard
approaching
sounds
a
moment
later
louise
came
in
she
blinked
at
the
light
and
began
to
unfasten
her
veil
before
she
was
over
the
threshold
he
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
at
last
thank
goodness
where
have
you
been
did
you
think
i
was
lost
have
you
been
here
long
for
hours
where
else
should
i
be
but
you
where
have
you
been
standing
before
the
table
she
fumbled
with
the
veil
which
she
had
pulled
into
a
knot
he
did
not
offer
to
help
her
he
stood
looking
at
her
and
both
voice
and
look
were
a
little
stern
why
did
you
go
out
she
did
not
look
at
him
oh
just
for
a
breath
of
air
i
felt
i
i
had
to
do
something
from
the
moment
of
her
entrance
even
before
she
had
spoken
maurice
was
aware
of
that
peculiar
aloofness
in
her
which
invariably
made
itself
felt
when
she
was
engrossed
by
something
in
which
he
had
no
part
that
hardly
a
reason
he
said
nervously
with
the
veil
stretched
between
her
two
hands
she
turned
her
head
do
you
want
another
well
after
you
left
me
i
lay
and
thought
and
thought
till
i
felt
i
should
go
mad
if
i
lay
there
any
longer
yes
but
all
of
a
sudden
like
this
after
being
in
bed
for
three
days
to
go
out
and
but
i
have
not
been
ill
go
out
and
wander
about
the
streets
at
night
i
did
mean
to
be
so
late
she
said
and
folded
the
veil
with
an
exaggerated
care
but
i
was
hindered
i
had
a
little
adventure
what
do
you
mean
oh
nothing
much
a
man
followed
me
and
i
could
get
rid
of
him
go
on
please
he
was
astonished
at
the
severity
of
his
own
voice
oh
do
be
so
serious
maurice
she
had
folded
the
veil
to
a
neat
square
stuck
three
hatpins
in
it
and
thrown
it
with
her
hat
and
jacket
on
the
sofa
no
one
has
tried
to
murder
me
she
said
and
raised
both
her
hands
to
her
hair
i
was
standing
before
window
the
big
jeweller
in
the
peterstrasse
you
know
i
always
loved
jewellers
windows
especially
at
night
when
they
lighted
up
as
a
child
i
thought
heaven
must
be
like
the
glitter
of
diamonds
on
blue
velvet
the
jasper
sea
you
know
and
the
pearly
floor
never
mind
that
now
well
i
was
standing
there
looking
in
longer
perhaps
than
i
knew
i
felt
that
some
one
was
beside
me
but
i
did
see
who
it
was
till
i
heard
a
man
voice
say
sachen
fraulein
was
of
course
i
took
no
notice
but
i
did
run
away
as
if
i
were
afraid
of
him
i
went
on
looking
into
the
window
till
he
said
ich
ihnen
etwass
kaufen
more
nonsense
of
the
same
kind
then
i
thought
it
was
time
to
go
he
followed
me
down
the
peterstrasse
and
when
i
came
to
the
rossplatz
he
was
still
behind
me
so
i
determined
to
lead
him
a
dance
i
been
walking
about
with
him
at
my
heels
for
over
an
hour
in
a
quiet
street
where
there
was
no
one
in
sight
he
spoke
to
me
again
and
refused
to
go
away
until
i
told
him
where
i
lived
i
pretended
to
agree
and
on
the
condition
that
he
did
follow
me
any
further
i
gave
him
a
number
in
the
querstrasse
and
in
case
he
broke
his
word
i
came
home
that
way
i
hope
he
spend
a
pleasant
evening
looking
for
me
she
laughed
her
fitful
somewhat
unreal
laugh
which
was
always
displeasing
to
him
taken
in
conjunction
with
her
story
and
her
unconcerned
way
of
telling
it
it
jarred
on
him
as
never
before
let
me
catch
him
here
and
i
make
it
impossible
for
him
to
insult
a
woman
again
he
cried
for
it
is
an
insult
though
you
do
see
it
in
that
light
you
laugh
as
you
tell
it
as
if
something
amusing
had
happened
to
you
you
are
so
strange
tell
me
dearest
why
did
you
go
out
when
i
asked
you
you
would
come
no
then
i
was
in
the
mood
her
smile
faded
no
but
after
dark
and
quite
alone
then
the
mood
takes
you
but
i
done
it
hundreds
of
times
before
i
can
take
care
of
myself
you
are
never
to
do
it
again
do
you
hear
why
did
you
give
the
fellow
in
charge
he
asked
a
moment
later
in
a
burst
of
distrust
again
louise
laughed
oh
a
german
policeman
would
find
that
rather
funny
than
otherwise
it
the
rule
you
know
not
the
exception
and
the
same
thing
has
happened
to
me
before
so
often
that
it
literally
not
worth
mentioning
i
should
have
spoken
of
it
if
you
had
been
so
persistent
besides
she
added
as
an
afterthought
and
in
the
face
of
his
grave
displeasure
she
found
herself
wilfully
exaggerating
the
levity
of
her
tone
besides
this
was
the
kind
of
man
one
gives
in
charge
not
the
usual
type
a
graf
or
baron
at
least
he
was
as
nettled
as
she
had
intended
him
to
be
you
talk
just
as
if
you
had
had
experience
in
the
class
of
do
you
really
think
it
makes
things
any
better
to
my
mind
it
a
great
deal
but
the
thing
is
you
do
know
how
you
not
to
go
out
alone
again
at
night
i
forbid
it
this
is
the
first
time
for
weeks
and
see
what
happens
and
it
not
you
may
well
say
it
has
happened
to
you
before
i
do
know
what
it
is
but
the
very
look
at
you
as
no
business
to
as
they
do
look
at
other
women
well
can
i
help
that
how
men
look
at
me
she
asked
indignantly
do
you
wish
to
say
it
my
fault
that
i
do
anything
to
make
them
no
though
it
might
be
better
if
you
did
he
answered
gloomily
the
unpleasant
thing
is
though
you
do
nothing
that
it
there
all
the
same
something
i
do
know
what
no
i
do
think
you
do
and
neither
do
i
but
i
do
know
that
you
are
being
very
rude
to
me
as
he
made
no
reply
she
went
on
you
will
however
at
least
give
me
credit
for
knowing
how
to
keep
men
at
a
distance
though
i
ca
hinder
them
from
looking
at
and
for
your
own
comfort
remember
in
future
that
i
not
an
inexperienced
child
there
nothing
i
do
know
you
need
throw
that
up
at
me
i
at
you
she
laughed
hotly
that
surely
reversing
the
order
of
things
is
it
it
ought
to
be
the
other
way
about
unfortunately
it
is
the
look
he
gave
her
was
made
up
of
mingled
anger
and
entreaty
but
as
she
took
no
notice
of
it
he
turned
away
and
going
to
the
window
leaned
his
forehead
against
the
glass
what
affected
him
so
disagreeably
was
not
the
incident
of
the
man
following
her
but
her
light
way
of
regarding
it
and
as
the
knowledge
of
this
came
home
to
him
he
was
impelled
to
go
on
speaking
it
a
trifle
to
make
a
fuss
about
i
know
he
said
and
i
should
give
it
a
second
thought
if
i
could
only
feel
louise
that
you
looked
at
it
as
i
do
and
felt
about
it
as
i
do
you
seem
so
indifferent
to
what
it
really
means
it
almost
as
if
you
enjoyed
it
other
women
are
different
they
resent
such
a
thing
instinctively
while
you
do
even
take
offence
and
men
feel
that
in
you
somehow
that
what
makes
them
look
at
you
and
follow
you
about
that
what
attracts
them
and
always
has
done
far
too
easily
you
among
the
rest
for
god
sake
hold
your
tongue
you
do
know
what
you
saying
oh
i
know
well
enough
she
put
her
hair
back
from
her
forehead
and
passed
her
handkerchief
over
her
lips
instead
of
lecturing
me
in
this
way
you
might
be
grateful
i
think
that
i
did
accept
the
offer
and
go
somewhere
to
supper
with
him
it
dull
enough
here
you
do
make
things
very
gay
for
me
altogether
you
are
treating
me
as
if
i
were
a
criminal
he
did
not
answer
the
words
you
among
the
rest
went
on
sounding
in
his
ears
yes
there
was
truth
in
them
a
horrible
truth
who
was
he
to
sit
in
judgment
either
on
her
or
on
those
others
who
yielded
to
the
attraction
that
went
out
from
her
had
not
he
himself
been
in
love
with
her
before
he
even
knew
her
name
had
he
then
accused
her
laid
the
blame
at
her
door
she
caught
a
moth
that
was
fluttering
round
the
lamp
and
carried
it
to
the
window
when
a
moment
later
he
turned
and
gave
her
another
unhappy
look
she
felt
a
kind
of
pity
for
him
forced
as
he
was
by
his
nature
to
work
himself
into
unhappiness
over
such
a
trivial
matter
do
let
us
say
unkind
things
to
each
other
she
said
slowly
sorry
if
i
had
known
it
would
worry
you
so
much
i
should
have
said
a
word
about
it
that
would
have
been
easy
he
felt
her
touch
on
his
arm
as
it
grew
warm
and
close
he
too
was
filled
with
the
wish
to
be
at
one
with
her
again
to
be
lulled
into
security
he
pressed
her
hand
forgive
me
i
been
bothered
pestered
with
black
thoughts
or
else
i
should
go
on
like
this
now
she
was
silent
both
stared
out
into
the
night
and
then
a
strange
thing
happened
he
began
to
speak
again
and
words
rose
to
his
lips
of
which
a
moment
before
he
had
had
no
idea
but
which
he
now
knew
for
absolute
truth
he
said
i
do
want
to
excuse
myself
i
jealous
i
admit
it
and
yet
there
is
an
excuse
for
me
louise
for
saying
such
things
to
you
i
mean
i
have
you
ever
thought
dear
what
a
difference
it
would
make
to
us
if
you
had
i
mean
if
i
knew
that
you
had
never
cared
for
anyone
if
you
had
never
belonged
to
anyone
but
me
that
what
i
wish
now
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
if
i
could
just
say
to
myself
no
one
but
me
has
ever
held
her
in
his
arms
and
no
one
ever
will
do
you
think
then
darling
i
could
speak
as
i
have
a
moment
back
he
had
had
no
thought
of
such
a
thing
now
here
it
was
expressed
over
his
lips
another
of
those
strange
inlying
truths
which
were
existent
in
him
and
only
waited
for
a
certain
moment
to
come
to
light
strangest
of
all
perhaps
was
the
manner
in
which
it
impressed
itself
on
him
in
it
seemed
to
be
summed
up
his
trouble
of
the
afternoon
his
suspense
and
irritation
of
the
later
hours
it
was
as
if
he
had
suddenly
found
a
formula
for
them
and
as
he
stated
it
he
was
dumbfounded
by
its
significance
a
pealed
a
single
stroke
oh
yes
perhaps
said
louise
in
a
low
voice
she
could
not
rouse
herself
to
a
very
keen
interest
in
his
feelings
no
not
perhaps
yes
a
thousand
times
yes
everything
would
be
changed
by
it
then
i
could
torment
you
and
our
love
would
have
a
certainty
such
as
it
can
now
never
have
but
you
knew
maurice
i
told
you
everything
you
said
it
matter
and
it
does
and
never
shall
but
to
make
it
undone
i
would
cheerfully
give
years
of
my
life
you
a
woman
you
ca
understand
these
things
or
know
what
we
miss
you
mine
only
life
would
be
the
same
for
a
moment
she
did
not
answer
then
the
same
toneless
voice
came
out
of
the
darkness
at
his
side
but
i
am
yours
only
now
and
it
a
foolish
thing
to
wish
for
the
impossible
vii
it
was
indeed
a
preposterous
thought
to
have
at
this
date
no
one
knew
that
better
than
himself
and
as
long
as
he
was
with
louise
he
kept
it
at
bay
it
was
a
fatuous
thing
even
to
allow
himself
to
think
considering
the
past
and
considering
all
he
knew
but
next
morning
as
he
sat
with
busy
fingers
and
a
vacant
mind
it
returned
he
thrust
it
angrily
away
endeavouring
to
concentrate
his
attention
on
his
music
open
before
him
for
a
time
he
believed
he
had
succeeded
then
the
idea
was
unexpectedly
present
to
him
again
and
this
time
more
forcibly
than
before
it
came
like
a
sharp
swift
stab
of
remembrance
and
forced
an
exclamation
over
his
lips
discouraged
he
let
his
hands
drop
from
the
keys
of
the
piano
for
now
he
knew
that
he
would
probably
never
be
rid
of
it
again
this
was
always
the
way
with
unpleasant
thoughts
and
impressions
if
they
returned
after
he
had
resolved
to
have
done
with
them
they
were
henceforth
part
and
parcel
of
himself
fixed
ideas
against
which
his
will
was
powerless
in
the
hope
of
growing
used
to
the
haunting
reflection
and
to
the
unhappiness
it
implied
he
thought
it
through
to
the
end
this
strange
unsought
knowledge
which
had
lain
unsuspected
in
him
and
now
became
articulate
once
considered
however
it
made
many
things
clear
he
could
even
account
to
himself
now
for
the
blasphemous
suggestions
that
had
plagued
him
not
hours
ago
if
he
had
then
not
all
unconsciously
had
the
feeling
that
louise
had
known
too
long
and
too
well
what
love
was
to
be
willing
to
live
without
it
such
thoughts
as
those
would
never
have
risen
in
him
in
vain
he
asked
himself
why
he
should
only
now
understand
these
things
he
could
find
no
answer
throughout
the
time
he
had
known
louise
he
had
been
better
acquainted
with
her
mode
of
life
than
anyone
else
her
past
had
lain
open
to
him
she
had
concealed
nothing
had
been
what
she
called
brutally
frank
with
him
and
he
had
protested
and
honestly
believed
that
what
had
preceded
their
intimacy
did
not
matter
to
him
who
could
foresee
that
on
a
certain
day
an
idea
of
this
kind
would
break
out
in
him
like
a
canker
but
this
query
took
him
a
step
further
was
it
not
deluding
himself
to
say
break
out
had
not
this
shadow
lurked
in
their
love
from
the
very
beginning
had
it
not
formed
an
invisible
barrier
between
them
it
was
possible
no
it
was
true
though
he
only
recognised
its
truth
at
the
present
time
it
had
existed
from
the
first
something
which
each
of
them
in
turn
had
felt
and
vaguely
tried
to
express
it
had
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
that
they
had
defied
convention
that
regrettable
though
it
might
be
was
beside
the
mark
the
confounding
truth
was
that
in
an
emotional
crisis
of
an
intensity
of
the
one
they
had
come
through
it
was
imperative
to
be
able
to
say
our
love
is
unparalleled
unique
or
at
least
i
am
the
only
possible
one
i
am
yours
you
are
mine
only
that
had
not
been
the
case
what
he
had
been
forced
to
tell
himself
was
that
he
was
not
the
first
and
now
he
knew
that
for
some
time
past
he
had
been
aware
that
he
would
always
occupy
the
second
place
she
was
forced
to
compare
him
with
another
to
his
disadvantage
and
he
knew
more
for
the
first
time
he
allowed
his
thoughts
to
rove
unchecked
over
her
previous
life
and
he
was
no
longer
astonished
at
the
imperfections
of
the
present
to
him
the
gradual
unfolding
of
their
love
had
been
a
wonderful
revelation
to
her
a
repetition
and
a
paler
and
fainter
one
of
a
tale
she
already
knew
by
heart
and
the
knowledge
of
this
awakened
a
fresh
distrust
in
him
if
she
had
loved
that
first
time
as
she
had
asserted
as
he
had
seen
with
his
own
eyes
that
she
did
desperately
abandonedly
how
had
it
been
possible
for
her
to
change
front
so
quickly
to
turn
to
him
and
love
anew
was
such
a
thing
credible
was
a
woman
nature
capable
of
it
and
had
it
not
been
this
constant
fear
lest
he
should
never
be
able
to
efface
the
image
of
his
predecessor
which
yesterday
had
boldly
stalked
out
as
a
dread
that
what
had
drawn
her
to
him
had
not
been
love
at
all
but
this
mood
passed
he
himself
cared
too
well
to
doubt
for
long
that
in
her
own
way
she
really
loved
him
what
however
he
was
obliged
to
admit
was
that
what
she
felt
could
in
no
way
be
counted
the
equal
of
his
love
for
her
that
had
possessed
a
kind
of
primeval
freshness
which
no
repetition
however
passionately
fond
could
achieve
and
yet
in
his
mind
there
was
still
room
for
doubt
eager
willing
doubt
it
was
due
to
his
ignorance
he
became
aware
of
this
and
while
brooding
over
these
things
he
was
overmanned
by
the
desire
to
learn
from
her
own
lips
more
about
her
past
to
hear
exactly
what
it
had
meant
to
her
in
order
that
he
might
compare
it
with
her
present
life
and
with
her
feelings
for
him
who
could
say
if
by
doing
this
he
might
not
drive
away
what
was
perhaps
a
phantom
of
his
own
uneasy
brain
he
resolved
to
make
the
endeavour
but
he
was
careful
not
to
let
her
suspect
his
intention
first
of
all
he
was
full
of
compunction
for
his
bad
temper
of
the
night
before
he
was
also
slightly
ashamed
of
what
he
was
going
to
do
and
then
too
he
knew
that
she
would
resent
his
prying
what
he
did
must
be
done
with
tact
he
had
no
wish
to
make
her
unhappy
over
it
and
so
when
he
saw
her
again
he
did
his
best
to
make
her
forget
how
disagreeable
he
had
been
but
the
desire
to
know
remained
became
a
morbid
curiosity
if
this
were
satisfied
he
believed
it
would
make
things
easier
for
both
of
them
but
he
was
infinitely
cautious
sometimes
without
a
word
he
took
her
face
between
his
hands
and
looked
into
her
eyes
as
if
to
read
in
them
an
answer
to
the
questions
he
was
afraid
to
put
looked
right
into
the
depth
of
her
eyes
where
the
pupils
swam
in
an
oval
of
bluish
white
overhung
by
lids
which
were
finely
creased
in
their
folds
and
netted
with
tiny
veins
but
he
said
not
a
word
and
the
eyes
remained
unfathomable
as
they
had
always
been
meanwhile
he
did
what
he
could
to
set
his
life
on
a
solid
basis
again
but
he
was
unable
to
arouse
in
himself
a
very
vital
interest
in
his
work
some
in
him
seemed
to
have
been
injured
and
often
he
was
overcome
by
the
feeling
that
this
perpetual
preoccupation
with
music
was
only
a
trifling
with
existence
an
excuse
for
not
facing
the
facts
of
life
he
would
sometimes
rather
have
been
a
labourer
worn
out
with
physical
toil
he
was
much
alone
too
when
he
was
not
with
louise
he
was
given
over
to
his
own
thoughts
and
day
by
day
fostered
by
the
long
empty
hours
of
practice
these
moved
more
and
more
steadily
in
the
one
direction
the
craving
for
a
knowledge
of
the
facts
for
certainty
in
any
form
this
became
a
reason
for
a
plea
in
extenuation
of
what
he
felt
escaping
him
louise
did
not
help
him
she
assented
to
what
he
did
without
comment
half
sorry
for
him
in
what
seemed
to
her
his
wilful
blindness
half
disdainful
but
she
too
made
a
discovery
in
these
tame
flat
days
and
this
was
that
it
was
one
thing
to
say
to
herself
it
is
over
and
done
with
and
another
to
make
the
assertion
a
fact
energy
for
the
effort
was
lacking
in
her
for
the
short
sharp
stroke
which
with
her
meant
action
was
invariably
born
of
intense
happiness
or
unhappiness
now
as
the
days
went
by
she
asked
herself
why
she
should
do
it
it
was
so
much
easier
to
let
things
slide
until
something
happened
of
itself
either
to
make
the
break
or
to
fill
up
the
still
greater
emptiness
in
her
life
which
a
break
would
cause
and
if
he
were
content
with
what
she
could
give
him
well
and
good
she
made
no
attempt
to
deceive
him
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
was
content
though
in
a
somewhat
preoccupied
way
but
a
little
later
she
acknowledged
to
herself
that
this
was
not
the
whole
truth
there
was
habit
to
fight
against
habit
which
could
still
give
her
hours
of
and
one
could
not
forgo
all
at
once
and
under
no
pressing
necessity
to
do
so
this
means
of
escape
from
the
cheerlessness
of
life
but
not
for
long
did
matters
remain
at
this
negative
stage
whereas
until
now
the
touch
of
her
lips
had
been
sufficient
to
chase
away
the
shadows
the
moment
came
when
as
he
held
her
in
his
arms
maurice
was
paralysed
by
the
abrupt
remembrance
she
has
known
all
this
before
how
was
it
then
to
what
degree
is
she
mine
was
she
his
what
fine
ultimate
shade
of
feeling
is
she
keeping
back
from
me
his
ardour
was
damped
and
as
louise
also
became
aware
of
his
sudden
coolness
their
hands
sank
apart
and
had
no
strength
to
join
anew
thus
far
he
had
gone
about
his
probings
with
skill
questioning
her
in
a
roundabout
way
trying
to
learn
by
means
of
inference
but
after
this
he
let
himself
go
and
put
a
barefaced
question
the
subject
once
broached
there
was
no
further
need
of
concealment
and
he
flung
tact
and
prudence
to
the
winds
he
could
not
forget
he
was
goaded
on
by
the
look
she
had
given
him
as
the
ominous
words
crossed
his
lips
it
made
him
conscious
once
more
of
the
unapproachable
nature
of
that
first
love
of
hers
he
grew
reckless
and
while
he
had
hitherto
only
sought
to
surprise
her
and
entrap
her
he
now
began
to
try
to
worm
things
out
of
her
all
the
time
spying
on
her
looks
and
words
ready
to
take
advantage
of
the
least
slip
on
her
part
at
first
before
she
understood
what
he
was
aiming
at
louise
had
been
as
frank
as
usual
with
him
that
somewhat
barbarous
frankness
which
took
small
note
of
the
recipient
feelings
but
after
he
had
put
a
direct
question
and
followed
it
up
with
others
of
which
she
too
clearly
saw
the
drift
she
drew
back
as
though
she
were
afraid
of
him
it
was
not
alone
the
error
of
taste
he
committed
in
delving
in
matters
which
he
had
sworn
should
never
concern
him
it
was
his
manner
of
doing
it
that
was
so
distasteful
to
her
his
hints
and
inuendoes
she
grew
very
white
and
still
and
looked
at
him
with
eyes
in
which
a
nascent
dislike
was
visible
he
saw
it
but
it
was
now
too
late
day
by
day
his
preoccupation
with
the
man
who
had
preceded
him
increased
the
thought
that
continued
to
harass
him
was
if
she
had
never
known
the
other
all
would
now
be
different
with
jealousy
his
state
of
mind
had
only
as
yet
in
common
a
devouring
curiosity
and
a
morbid
imagination
which
allowed
him
to
picture
the
two
of
them
in
situations
he
would
once
have
blushed
to
think
of
for
the
one
thing
that
now
mattered
to
him
what
he
would
have
given
his
life
to
know
and
would
probably
never
know
was
concerned
with
the
ultimate
ratification
of
love
what
had
she
had
for
the
other
that
she
could
not
give
him
that
she
wilfully
refrained
from
giving
him
for
that
she
did
this
and
always
had
refused
him
part
of
herself
was
now
as
plain
to
him
as
if
it
had
been
branded
on
her
flesh
and
the
knowledge
undermined
their
lives
if
she
was
gentle
and
kind
he
read
into
her
words
pity
that
she
could
give
him
no
more
if
she
were
cold
and
evasive
she
was
remembering
comparing
if
she
returned
his
kisses
with
her
former
warmth
well
the
thoughts
which
in
this
case
seized
him
were
the
most
murderous
of
all
his
mental
activity
ground
him
down
but
it
was
not
all
unhappiness
the
beloved
eyes
and
hands
the
wilful
hair
and
pale
sweet
mouth
could
still
stir
him
and
there
came
hours
of
wishless
when
his
tired
brain
found
rest
as
the
days
went
by
however
these
grew
rarer
it
also
seemed
to
him
that
he
paid
dearly
for
them
by
being
afterwards
more
miserable
by
suffering
in
a
more
active
way
at
times
he
knew
he
was
anything
but
a
pleasant
companion
but
he
was
losing
the
mastery
over
himself
and
often
a
trifle
was
sufficient
to
start
him
off
afresh
on
the
dreary
theme
once
in
a
fit
of
hopelessness
he
made
her
what
amounted
to
reproaches
for
her
past
but
you
knew
everythinging
i
told
you
all
louise
expostulated
and
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
i
know
you
did
but
louise
he
hesitated
half
contrite
in
advance
for
what
he
was
going
to
say
it
might
have
been
better
if
you
told
me
everything
i
mean
yes
i
believe
it
better
not
to
know
she
did
not
reply
as
she
might
have
done
that
she
had
forewarned
him
afraid
of
this
she
looked
away
so
that
she
should
not
be
obliged
to
see
him
another
day
when
they
were
walking
in
the
rosental
she
made
him
extremely
unhappy
by
disagreeing
with
him
if
one
could
just
take
a
sponge
and
wipe
the
past
out
like
figures
from
a
slate
he
said
moodily
but
jaded
by
his
persistency
louise
would
not
admit
it
we
should
have
nothing
to
remember
that
just
it
but
it
belongs
to
us
she
was
roused
to
protest
by
the
in
his
words
it
as
much
a
part
of
ourselves
as
our
thoughts
are
or
our
hands
one
is
glad
to
forget
you
would
be
louise
you
would
care
if
your
past
were
gone
say
you
would
but
she
only
threw
him
a
dark
as
however
he
would
not
rest
content
she
flung
out
her
hands
with
an
impatient
gesture
how
can
you
torment
yourself
so
if
you
insist
on
knowing
well
then
i
would
part
with
an
hour
of
what
gone
not
an
hour
and
you
know
it
she
caught
at
a
few
vivid
leaves
that
had
remained
hanging
on
a
bare
branch
and
carried
them
with
her
he
took
one
she
held
out
to
him
looked
at
it
without
seeing
it
and
threw
it
away
tell
me
just
this
once
something
about
your
life
before
i
knew
you
were
you
very
happy
or
were
you
unhappy
do
you
know
i
once
heard
you
say
you
had
never
known
a
happiness
yes
one
summer
night
long
ago
over
in
the
nonne
how
i
hoped
then
it
was
true
but
i
do
know
you
never
told
me
anything
of
all
there
must
be
to
tell
what
you
may
have
chanced
to
hear
by
eavesdropping
does
concern
me
now
louise
answered
coldly
and
then
she
shut
her
lips
and
would
say
no
more
she
was
wiser
than
she
had
been
a
week
ago
she
refused
to
hand
her
past
over
to
him
in
order
that
he
might
smirch
it
with
his
thoughts
but
she
could
not
understand
him
understand
the
motives
that
made
him
want
to
unearth
the
past
if
this
were
jealousy
it
was
a
kind
she
did
not
know
a
bloodless
bodiless
kind
of
which
she
had
had
no
experience
but
it
was
not
jealousy
it
was
only
a
craving
for
certainty
in
any
guise
and
the
more
surely
maurice
felt
that
he
would
never
gain
it
the
more
tenaciously
he
strove
for
certainty
that
feeling
of
utter
reliance
in
the
loved
one
which
sets
the
heart
at
rest
and
leaves
the
mind
free
for
the
affairs
of
life
was
what
louise
had
never
given
him
he
had
always
been
obliged
to
fall
back
on
supposition
with
regard
to
her
equally
at
the
height
of
their
passion
and
in
that
first
and
stretch
of
time
when
it
was
forbidden
him
to
touch
her
hand
the
real
truth
the
truth
about
her
it
would
not
be
his
to
know
soul
would
never
be
absorbed
in
soul
not
the
most
passionate
embraces
could
bridge
the
gulf
to
their
last
kiss
they
would
remain
separate
beings
lonely
and
alone
as
this
went
on
he
came
to
hate
the
vapidities
of
the
concerto
in
g
major
mentally
to
be
stretched
on
a
kind
of
rack
and
at
the
same
time
to
be
forced
to
reiterate
the
empty
rhetoric
of
this
music
from
this
time
forward
he
could
not
hear
the
name
of
mendelssohn
without
a
shiver
of
repugnance
how
he
wished
now
that
he
had
been
content
with
the
bare
sincerity
of
beethoven
who
at
least
said
no
note
more
than
he
had
to
say
one
day
towards
the
end
of
november
he
was
working
with
even
greater
distaste
than
usual
finally
in
exasperation
he
flapped
the
music
to
shut
the
piano
and
went
out
a
stroll
along
the
muddy
little
river
brought
him
to
the
pleissenburg
and
from
there
he
crossed
the
konigsplatz
to
the
bruderstrasse
he
had
not
come
out
with
the
intention
of
going
to
louise
but
although
it
was
barely
four
the
afternoon
was
drawing
in
an
interminable
evening
had
to
be
got
through
he
had
been
walking
at
haphazard
and
without
relish
now
his
pace
grew
brisker
having
reached
the
house
he
sprang
nimbly
up
the
stairs
and
was
about
to
insert
his
key
in
the
little
door
in
the
wall
when
he
was
arrested
by
a
muffled
sound
of
voices
louise
was
talking
to
some
one
and
at
the
noise
he
made
outside
she
raised
her
voice
purposely
no
doubt
he
could
not
hear
what
was
being
said
but
the
second
voice
was
a
man
for
a
minute
he
stood
with
his
key
suspended
straining
his
cars
then
afraid
of
being
caught
he
went
downstairs
again
where
he
hung
about
between
stair
and
in
order
that
anyone
who
came
down
would
be
forced
to
pass
him
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
however
his
patience
was
spent
he
remembered
too
that
the
person
might
be
as
likely
to
go
up
as
down
he
mounted
the
stairs
again
rang
the
bell
and
had
himself
admitted
by
the
landlady
he
thought
she
looked
significantly
at
him
as
with
her
usual
pantomime
of
winks
and
signs
she
whispered
to
him
that
a
gentleman
was
with
fraulein
ein
schoner
junger
mann
maurice
pushed
her
aside
and
opened
the
door
two
heads
turned
at
his
entrance
on
the
sofa
beside
louise
sat
herries
the
ruddy
little
student
of
medicine
with
whom
she
had
danced
so
often
at
the
ball
he
sat
there
smiling
and
dapper
balancing
his
hard
round
hat
on
his
knee
and
holding
gloves
in
his
hand
louise
looked
the
more
untidy
by
contrast
as
usual
her
hair
was
half
uncoiled
maurice
saw
this
in
a
flash
saw
also
the
look
of
annoyance
that
crossed
her
face
at
his
unceremonious
entry
she
raised
astonished
eyebrows
then
however
she
shook
hands
with
him
i
think
you
know
mr
herries
maurice
bowed
stiffly
across
the
table
herries
replied
in
kind
without
discommoding
himself
how
d
do
i
believe
we
met
he
said
carelessly
as
maurice
made
no
rejoinder
but
remained
standing
in
an
uncompromising
attitude
herries
turned
to
louise
again
and
went
on
with
what
he
had
been
saying
he
was
talking
of
england
i
went
back
to
oxford
after
that
he
continued
i
diggings
there
do
you
know
an
old
chum
of
mine
a
fellow
of
magdalen
i
was
just
in
time
for
eights
week
a
magnificent
for
our
fellows
ever
seen
the
race
no
oh
i
say
that
too
bad
you
must
come
over
for
it
next
year
herries
only
returned
from
england
a
few
days
ago
explained
louise
and
again
raised
warning
brows
do
sit
down
there
a
chair
yes
i
was
over
for
the
whole
summer
did
work
here
at
all
in
fact
added
herries
once
more
letting
his
bright
eyes
snapshot
the
young
man
who
on
sitting
down
laid
his
shabby
felt
hat
in
the
middle
of
the
table
but
now
you
intend
to
stay
i
think
you
said
louise
threw
in
at
random
after
they
had
waited
for
maurice
to
fill
up
the
pause
yes
for
the
winter
semester
anyhow
and
i
got
to
tumble
to
with
a
vengeance
but
i
mean
to
have
a
good
time
all
the
same
even
though
it
only
leipzig
one
can
have
a
jolly
enough
time
again
there
was
silence
louise
flushed
i
suppose
you
hard
at
work
already
yes
got
started
yesterday
frogs
do
you
know
the
effect
of
a
rare
poison
on
frogs
this
trivial
exchange
of
words
stung
maurice
herries
manner
seemed
to
him
intolerably
familiar
lacking
in
respect
and
he
kept
telling
himself
as
he
listened
that
having
returned
from
england
the
fellow
first
thought
had
been
of
her
he
had
not
opened
his
lips
since
entering
he
sat
staring
at
them
forgetful
of
good
manners
and
after
a
little
both
began
to
feel
ill
at
ease
their
eyes
met
for
a
moment
in
this
sensation
and
herries
cleared
his
throat
what
did
you
do
with
yourself
in
summer
he
queried
and
could
not
restrain
a
smile
at
the
fashion
in
which
the
other
fellow
was
giving
himself
away
you
were
in
england
at
all
i
think
you
said
we
hoped
we
might
meet
there
do
you
remember
too
bad
that
i
had
to
go
off
without
saying
no
i
changed
my
mind
and
stayed
here
but
i
should
do
it
again
it
was
so
hot
must
have
been
simply
beastly
maurice
jerked
his
arm
a
vase
which
was
standing
at
his
elbow
upset
and
the
water
trickled
to
the
floor
neither
offered
to
help
him
he
had
to
stoop
and
mop
it
up
with
his
handkerchief
for
a
few
moments
longer
the
conversation
was
eked
out
then
herries
rose
with
her
hand
in
his
he
said
earnestly
now
you
must
be
merciful
and
relent
i
sha
give
up
hope
any
time
in
the
next
fortnight
is
time
enough
remember
my
word
i
dreamt
of
those
waltzes
of
ours
ever
since
and
the
floor
at
the
prusse
is
still
better
do
you
know
you
wo
have
the
heart
not
to
come
from
under
her
lids
louise
shot
a
rapid
glance
at
maurice
he
too
had
risen
he
was
standing
stiff
pale
and
solemn
visibly
waiting
only
till
herries
had
gone
to
make
himself
disagreeable
she
smiled
do
ask
me
to
give
an
answer
i
let
you
know
will
that
do
a
fortnight
is
such
a
long
time
and
then
you
forgotten
the
chief
thing
i
must
see
if
i
have
anything
to
wear
oh
i
say
if
that
all
do
let
that
bother
you
that
black
thing
you
had
on
last
time
was
ripping
awfully
jolly
do
you
know
louise
laughed
well
perhaps
she
said
as
she
opened
the
door
good
business
responded
herries
he
nodded
in
maurice
direction
and
they
went
out
of
the
room
together
maurice
heard
their
voices
in
laughing
rejoinder
heard
them
take
leave
of
each
other
at
the
halldoor
after
that
there
was
a
pause
louise
lingered
before
returning
to
open
a
letter
that
was
lying
on
the
she
also
spoke
to
fraulein
grunhut
when
she
did
come
back
all
trace
of
animation
had
gone
from
her
face
she
busied
herself
at
once
with
the
flowers
he
had
disarranged
and
this
done
ordered
her
hair
before
the
hanging
glass
maurice
followed
her
movements
with
a
sarcastic
smile
suddenly
she
turned
and
confronted
him
maurice
for
heaven
sake
do
glare
at
me
like
that
if
anything
to
say
please
say
it
and
be
done
with
it
you
know
well
enough
what
i
have
to
say
his
voice
was
husky
indeed
i
do
well
you
ought
to
ought
to
no
there
a
limit
to
everything
take
your
hat
off
that
table
what
did
you
mean
by
bursting
into
the
room
when
you
heard
some
one
was
here
and
as
if
that
were
enough
to
let
everybody
see
how
much
at
home
you
are
your
behaviour
your
unbearable
want
of
manners
she
stopped
and
pressed
her
handkerchief
to
her
lips
i
believed
you
did
care
what
people
thought
he
threw
in
morosely
defiant
that
a
poor
excuse
for
your
rudeness
well
at
least
tell
me
what
that
fool
wanted
here
have
you
no
ears
could
you
hear
that
he
has
just
come
back
from
england
and
is
calling
on
his
friends
do
you
expect
me
to
believe
that
maurice
oh
he
has
always
been
after
you
since
that
night
it
only
because
he
was
here
long
enough
and
his
manner
shows
what
he
thinks
of
you
and
what
he
means
what
do
you
mean
do
you
wish
to
say
it
my
doing
that
he
came
here
do
you
believe
me
she
demanded
as
he
did
not
answer
and
you
in
that
condition
could
i
dress
before
him
how
abominable
you
are
he
tried
to
explain
yes
because
i
hate
the
sight
of
the
you
did
know
he
was
coming
did
you
or
you
would
have
seen
him
know
he
was
coming
she
wrenched
her
hands
away
oh
say
you
did
maurice
be
jealous
if
you
must
but
surely
surely
you
believe
oh
do
ask
me
what
i
believe
i
only
know
i
wo
have
that
man
hanging
about
it
was
by
a
mere
chance
that
i
came
round
earlier
he
might
have
been
here
for
hours
without
my
suspecting
it
who
knows
if
you
would
have
told
me
either
would
you
have
told
me
louise
oh
how
can
you
be
like
this
what
is
the
matter
with
you
he
put
his
arms
round
her
with
the
old
cry
i
ca
bear
you
even
to
look
at
another
man
for
he
in
love
with
you
and
has
been
ever
since
you
made
him
crazy
by
dancing
with
him
as
you
did
with
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
he
rested
his
face
on
her
hair
promise
me
you
wo
see
him
again
wearily
louise
disengaged
herself
oh
there
always
something
fresh
to
promise
i
tired
of
it
of
being
hedged
in
and
watched
and
never
trusted
tired
of
me
you
mean
she
looked
bitterly
at
him
there
you
are
again
just
this
once
to
set
my
mind
at
rest
just
this
once
louise
darling
but
she
was
silent
then
you
let
him
come
here
again
how
do
i
know
but
if
i
promised
what
you
ask
i
should
not
be
able
to
go
with
him
to
the
hotel
de
prusse
on
the
fifteenth
you
mean
to
go
to
that
dance
why
not
would
there
be
any
harm
in
my
going
louise
maurice
she
mocked
his
tone
and
laughed
oh
go
at
once
she
broke
out
the
next
moment
and
order
grunhut
never
to
let
another
visitor
inside
the
door
make
me
promise
never
to
cross
the
threshold
alone
never
to
speak
to
another
mortal
but
yourself
cut
off
every
pleasure
and
every
chance
of
pleasure
i
have
and
then
you
may
be
but
only
may
be
content
you
trying
how
far
you
can
go
with
me
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
again
that
dancing
is
one
of
the
things
i
love
best
not
six
months
ago
you
knew
and
helped
me
to
it
yourself
yes
then
he
answered
then
i
could
refuse
you
nothing
she
laughed
in
an
unfriendly
way
he
pressed
her
hand
to
his
forehead
you
wo
be
so
cruel
i
know
you
know
more
than
i
do
do
you
realise
what
it
means
if
you
go
in
fancy
he
was
present
and
saw
her
passed
from
one
pair
of
arms
to
another
i
realise
nothing
but
that
i
am
very
unhappy
have
i
no
influence
over
you
any
more
none
at
all
ca
you
come
too
then
if
you
are
afraid
to
let
me
out
of
your
sight
i
to
see
you
he
broke
off
with
wrathful
abruptness
thanks
i
would
rather
be
shot
but
at
the
mingled
anger
and
blankness
of
her
face
he
coloured
louise
put
an
end
to
all
this
marry
me
now
at
once
marry
you
i
no
thank
you
we
past
that
stage
i
besides
are
you
so
simple
as
to
believe
it
would
make
any
difference
oh
stop
tormenting
me
come
here
and
he
pulled
her
to
him
from
this
day
forward
the
direction
of
his
thoughts
was
changed
the
incident
of
herries
visit
her
refusal
to
promise
what
he
asked
and
above
all
the
matter
of
the
coming
ball
with
regard
to
which
he
could
not
get
certainty
from
her
these
things
seemed
to
open
up
nightmare
depths
to
which
he
could
see
no
bottom
compared
with
them
the
vague
fears
which
had
hitherto
troubled
him
were
only
shadows
and
like
shadows
faded
away
he
no
longer
sought
out
superfine
reasons
for
their
lack
of
happiness
the
past
was
dead
and
gone
he
could
not
alter
jot
or
tittle
of
what
had
happened
he
could
only
make
the
best
of
it
and
so
he
ceased
to
brood
over
it
and
gave
himself
up
to
the
present
the
future
was
a
black
unknown
quantity
but
the
present
was
his
own
and
he
would
cling
to
it
for
who
knew
what
the
future
held
in
store
for
him
in
these
days
he
began
to
suspect
that
it
was
not
in
the
nature
of
things
for
her
always
to
remain
satisfied
with
him
and
ever
more
daring
the
horrid
question
reared
its
head
who
will
come
after
me
another
blind
attraction
only
needed
to
seize
her
and
what
then
would
become
of
constancy
and
truth
if
he
had
doubted
her
before
he
was
now
suspicious
from
a
different
cause
and
in
quite
a
different
way
the
face
of
the
trim
little
man
who
had
sat
beside
her
and
smiled
at
her
was
persistently
present
to
him
he
did
not
question
her
further
but
the
poison
worked
the
more
surely
in
secret
he
never
for
an
instant
forgot
and
jealousy
now
wide
awake
had
at
last
a
definite
object
to
lay
hold
of
in
his
lucid
moments
he
knew
that
he
was
making
her
life
a
burden
to
her
what
wonder
if
she
did
ultimately
turn
from
him
but
his
evil
moods
were
now
beyond
command
he
began
to
suspect
deceit
in
her
actions
as
well
as
in
what
she
said
the
idea
that
this
other
this
smirking
man
might
somehow
steal
her
from
him
hung
over
him
like
a
fog
obscuring
his
vision
it
necessitated
continued
watchfulness
on
his
part
and
so
he
dogged
her
mentally
and
in
fact
until
his
own
heart
all
but
broke
under
the
strain
one
afternoon
they
walked
to
connewitz
it
had
rained
heavily
during
the
night
and
the
unpaved
roads
were
inchdeep
in
mud
the
sky
was
a
level
sheet
of
cloud
darker
and
more
forbidding
in
the
east
their
direction
was
maurice
choice
louise
would
have
liked
better
to
keep
to
the
town
for
though
the
streets
too
were
there
would
soon
be
lights
and
the
reflection
of
lights
in
damp
pavements
she
yielded
however
without
even
troubling
to
express
her
wish
but
just
because
of
the
dirt
and
naked
ugliness
which
met
her
at
every
turn
she
was
voluble
and
excited
and
an
exaggerated
hilarity
seized
her
at
trifles
maurice
who
had
left
the
house
in
a
more
composed
frame
of
mind
than
usual
gradually
relapsed
at
her
want
of
restraint
into
silence
he
suffered
under
her
looseness
of
tongue
and
laughter
her
sallow
face
was
to
such
moods
below
her
feverish
animation
there
lurked
he
was
sure
of
it
a
deadly
melancholy
he
had
always
been
rendered
uneasy
by
her
spurts
of
gaiety
now
in
addition
he
asked
himself
what
has
happened
to
make
her
like
this
feeling
his
hostility
louise
grew
quieter
and
soon
she
too
was
silent
having
gained
his
end
maurice
wished
to
atone
for
it
and
slipping
his
arm
through
hers
he
took
her
hand
for
a
few
steps
they
walked
on
in
this
fashion
then
he
received
one
of
those
sudden
impressions
which
flash
on
us
from
time
to
time
of
having
seen
or
done
a
certain
thing
before
for
a
moment
he
could
not
verify
it
then
he
knew
just
in
this
way
arm
in
arm
hand
in
hand
had
she
come
towards
him
with
schilsky
that
very
first
day
it
was
no
doubt
a
habit
of
hers
like
this
too
she
would
in
all
probability
walk
with
the
one
who
came
after
and
the
picture
of
herries
in
the
place
he
now
occupied
was
photographed
on
his
brain
he
withdrew
his
arm
as
if
hers
had
burnt
him
his
mind
was
off
again
on
its
old
round
but
she
too
had
to
suffer
for
it
as
he
stood
back
to
let
her
pass
before
him
on
a
dry
strip
of
the
path
his
eye
caught
a
yellow
rose
she
was
wearing
at
her
belt
till
now
he
had
seen
it
without
seeing
it
why
are
you
wearing
that
rose
louise
looked
down
from
him
to
the
flower
and
back
again
why
you
know
i
like
to
wear
flowers
where
did
you
get
it
she
foresaw
what
he
was
driving
at
and
did
not
reply
you
were
wearing
a
rose
like
that
the
first
time
i
saw
you
do
you
remember
how
should
i
remember
it
so
long
ago
where
had
you
got
that
one
from
then
she
repeated
the
same
words
how
should
i
know
now
but
i
know
it
was
from
him
he
had
given
it
to
you
she
raised
her
shoulders
perhaps
perhaps
no
for
certain
well
and
if
so
was
there
anything
strange
in
that
they
walked
a
few
paces
without
speaking
then
he
asked
who
has
given
you
this
one
maurice
there
was
a
note
of
warning
in
her
voice
he
heard
it
in
vain
give
it
to
me
louise
no
let
it
be
it
will
wither
soon
enough
where
it
is
please
give
it
to
me
he
urged
rendered
the
more
determined
by
her
refusal
i
wish
to
keep
it
and
i
mean
to
have
it
to
avoid
the
threatening
scene
she
took
the
rose
from
her
belt
and
gave
it
to
him
he
fingered
it
indecisively
for
a
moment
then
threw
it
over
the
bridge
they
were
crossing
into
the
river
it
struggled
filled
with
muddy
water
and
floated
away
in
the
next
breath
however
he
asked
himself
ruefully
what
he
had
gained
by
his
action
she
had
given
him
the
rose
and
he
had
destroyed
it
but
he
would
never
know
how
she
had
come
by
it
and
what
it
had
been
to
her
he
was
incensed
with
himself
and
with
her
for
the
whole
length
of
the
schleussiger
weg
then
the
inevitable
regret
for
his
hastiness
followed
he
took
her
limply
hanging
hand
and
pressed
it
but
there
was
no
responsive
pressure
on
her
part
louise
looked
away
from
him
beyond
the
woods
as
far
as
she
could
see
in
the
vain
hope
of
there
discovering
some
means
of
escape
viii
in
descending
one
evening
the
broad
stair
of
the
gewandhaus
and
forced
by
reason
of
the
crowd
to
pause
on
every
step
madeleine
overheard
the
talk
of
two
men
behind
her
one
of
whom
it
seemed
had
all
the
gossip
of
the
place
at
his
fingertips
from
what
she
caught
up
greedily
as
soon
as
maurice
name
was
mentioned
she
learnt
a
surprising
piece
of
news
a
cat
and
dog
life
was
the
phrase
used
by
the
speaker
as
she
afterwards
picked
her
way
through
snow
and
slush
madeleine
confessed
to
herself
that
it
was
impossible
to
feel
regret
at
what
she
had
heard
perhaps
after
all
things
would
come
right
of
themselves
in
order
to
recover
from
his
infatuation
to
learn
what
louise
really
was
it
had
only
been
necessary
for
maurice
to
be
constantly
at
her
was
it
not
goethe
who
said
that
the
way
to
cure
a
bad
habit
was
to
indulge
it
but
a
few
days
afterwards
her
satisfaction
was
damped
late
one
afternoon
she
had
entered
seyffert
cafe
to
drink
a
cup
of
chocolate
at
a
table
parallel
with
the
one
she
chose
two
were
playing
draughts
madeleine
had
only
been
there
for
a
few
minutes
when
their
talk
which
went
on
unrestrainedly
between
the
moves
of
the
game
leapt
with
a
witticism
to
the
unlucky
pair
in
whom
she
was
interested
to
her
astonishment
she
now
heard
louise
name
coupled
with
that
of
another
man
well
i
never
said
the
second
of
the
two
behind
her
i
say
your
that
rough
on
guest
is
it
madeleine
turned
in
her
chair
and
faced
the
man
who
had
spoken
excuse
me
who
is
herries
she
asked
without
ceremony
in
her
own
room
that
evening
she
pondered
long
it
was
one
thing
for
the
two
to
drift
naturally
apart
another
for
maurice
to
see
himself
superseded
if
this
were
true
jealousy
and
nothing
else
would
be
at
the
root
of
their
disunion
madeleine
felt
very
unwilling
to
mix
herself
up
in
the
affair
it
would
be
like
plunging
two
clean
hands
into
dirty
water
but
then
you
never
could
tell
how
a
man
would
act
in
a
case
like
this
the
odds
were
ten
to
one
he
did
something
foolish
and
so
she
wrote
to
maurice
making
her
summons
imperative
this
failing
she
tried
to
waylay
him
going
to
or
from
his
classes
but
the
only
satisfaction
she
gained
was
the
knowledge
of
his
irregularity
during
the
week
she
waited
she
did
not
once
come
face
to
face
with
him
next
she
looked
round
her
for
some
common
friend
and
found
that
he
had
not
an
intimate
left
in
all
leipzig
she
wrote
again
still
more
plainly
and
again
he
ignored
her
letter
one
saturday
afternoon
she
was
walking
along
the
crowded
streets
of
the
inner
town
she
had
been
to
the
motette
in
the
thomaskirche
and
was
now
on
her
way
home
carrying
music
from
the
library
the
snow
had
melted
to
mud
and
sleet
was
falling
madeleine
had
no
umbrella
the
collar
of
her
cloak
was
turned
up
round
her
ears
and
her
small
felt
hat
covered
her
head
like
an
extinguisher
on
entering
the
peterstrasse
she
was
jostled
together
with
dove
it
was
impossible
to
beat
a
retreat
dove
seldom
hurried
on
this
day
as
on
any
other
he
walked
with
a
somewhat
pompous
emphasis
through
slush
and
stinging
rain
holding
his
umbrella
straight
aloft
over
him
as
he
might
have
carried
a
banner
he
was
shocked
to
find
madeleine
without
one
at
once
took
her
under
his
and
loaded
himself
with
her
music
all
with
that
air
of
which
invariably
made
her
keen
to
decline
his
aid
dove
was
radiant
he
prospered
as
do
only
the
happy
few
and
his
satisfaction
with
himself
and
with
the
world
in
general
was
somehow
expressed
even
through
the
medium
of
his
long
neck
and
gently
sloping
shoulders
he
greeted
madeleine
with
an
exaggerated
pleasure
accompanying
his
words
by
the
slow
smile
which
sometimes
set
her
wondering
if
he
were
not
perhaps
being
inwardly
satirical
at
the
expense
of
other
people
fooling
them
by
means
of
his
own
foolishness
but
however
this
might
be
the
cynical
feelings
that
took
her
in
his
presence
mounted
once
more
she
knew
his
symptoms
and
an
excess
of
content
was
just
as
distasteful
to
her
as
gluttony
or
or
any
other
however
she
checked
the
desire
to
snub
him
to
snub
until
she
had
succeeded
in
raising
that
impossible
ire
which
she
believed
must
lurk
somewhere
in
dove
for
as
she
plodded
along
at
his
side
sheltered
from
the
brunt
of
the
weather
it
occurred
to
her
that
here
was
some
one
whom
she
might
tap
on
the
subject
of
maurice
she
opened
fire
by
congratulating
her
companion
on
his
recent
performance
in
an
abendunterhaltung
at
the
time
even
she
had
been
forced
to
admit
it
a
creditable
piece
of
work
dove
who
privately
considered
it
epochmaking
was
outwardly
very
modest
he
could
not
refrain
from
letting
fall
that
the
old
director
had
afterwards
thanked
him
in
person
but
in
the
next
breath
he
pointed
out
a
slip
he
had
made
in
a
particular
passage
of
the
sonata
it
had
not
it
was
true
been
observed
he
believed
by
anyone
except
schwarz
and
himself
still
it
had
caused
him
considerable
annoyance
and
he
now
related
how
as
far
as
he
could
judge
it
had
come
about
the
current
inquiries
concerning
the
prufungen
then
passed
between
them
poor
old
schwarz
said
madeleine
we
shall
be
few
enough
this
year
tell
me
what
of
heinz
i
have
seen
him
for
an
age
i
regret
to
say
that
krafft
is
making
an
uncommon
donkey
of
himself
said
dove
he
had
another
shocking
row
with
schwarz
last
week
tch
tch
tch
said
madeleine
heinz
is
a
and
maurice
guest
what
about
him
i
have
seen
him
lately
indeed
how
is
that
i
not
in
the
same
class
with
him
now
his
hour
has
been
changed
has
it
indeed
said
madeleine
thoughtfully
this
accounted
for
her
having
been
unable
to
meet
maurice
what
he
playing
do
you
know
the
g
major
mendelssohn
i
understand
and
dove
looked
at
her
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
how
he
getting
on
with
it
she
queried
afresh
in
the
same
indifferent
tone
i
really
could
say
as
i
mentioned
he
in
another
class
oh
but
you
must
have
heard
said
madeleine
it
no
use
putting
me
off
she
added
with
determination
i
want
to
find
out
about
maurice
and
i
fear
i
ca
assist
you
all
i
have
chanced
to
hear
mere
rumour
of
course
is
that
well
if
guest
does
pull
himself
together
he
wo
play
at
by
the
way
what
did
you
think
of
james
the
other
night
in
the
lisztverein
oh
that
his
octaves
were
marvellous
of
course
said
madeleine
tartly
but
i
warn
you
she
continued
it
of
no
use
changing
the
subject
or
pretending
you
do
know
i
intend
to
speak
of
maurice
then
it
must
be
to
some
one
else
miss
madeleine
not
to
me
dove
could
never
be
induced
to
call
her
madeleine
as
her
other
friends
did
and
why
pray
are
you
to
be
the
exception
because
as
i
already
mentioned
i
do
see
any
more
of
guest
he
mixes
in
a
different
set
and
as
for
me
well
my
thoughts
are
occupied
with
i
trust
more
profitable
things
what
you
have
thoughts
too
i
hope
you
do
claim
a
monopoly
of
them
said
dove
and
smiled
in
his
imperturbable
way
as
however
madeleine
persisted
he
grew
grave
it
not
a
pleasant
subject
i
should
really
rather
not
discuss
it
miss
madeleine
oh
for
heaven
sake
do
let
us
play
the
prudish
or
sentimental
cried
madeleine
in
a
burst
of
impatience
of
course
it
pleasant
do
you
think
i
should
bother
with
you
was
on
her
tongue
she
checked
herself
and
substituted
trouble
you
about
it
if
it
were
but
maurice
was
once
a
friend
of
ours
you
do
deny
it
i
hope
she
threw
in
challengingly
for
dove
muttered
something
to
himself
and
i
want
to
get
at
the
truth
about
him
i
sorrier
than
i
can
say
to
hear
on
all
sides
what
a
fool
he
making
of
himself
dove
was
suavely
silent
of
course
continued
madeleine
with
a
sarcastic
inflection
of
course
i
ca
expect
you
to
see
it
as
i
do
men
look
at
these
things
differently
i
know
possibly
if
i
were
a
man
i
too
should
stand
by
with
my
hands
in
my
pockets
and
watch
a
friend
butt
his
head
against
a
stone
wall
thinking
it
indeed
rather
good
fun
she
had
touched
dove
on
a
tender
spot
i
can
assure
you
miss
madeleine
he
said
impressively
as
they
picked
their
steps
across
a
dirty
road
i
can
assure
you
you
are
mistaken
i
think
just
as
strictly
in
matters
of
this
kind
as
you
but
as
to
interfering
in
guest
in
his
private
affairs
well
frankly
i
should
care
to
try
it
he
was
always
a
curiously
reserved
fellow
reserved
call
it
what
you
like
said
madeleine
but
do
imagine
i
asking
you
to
interfere
i
only
want
you
to
tell
me
briefly
and
simply
what
you
know
about
him
and
to
make
it
easier
for
you
i
begin
by
telling
you
what
i
it
an
old
story
is
it
that
maurice
once
supplanted
some
one
else
in
a
certain
young
woman
favour
well
now
i
hear
that
he
in
turn
is
to
be
laid
on
the
is
that
true
or
is
it
really
miss
madeleine
that
a
very
blunt
way
of
putting
it
said
dove
uncomfortably
oh
when
a
friend
at
stake
i
ca
hum
and
haw
said
madeleine
who
could
never
keep
her
temper
with
dove
for
long
i
call
a
spade
a
spade
and
rejoice
to
do
it
what
i
ask
you
to
tell
me
is
whether
been
correctly
informed
or
not
have
you
too
heard
louise
name
coupled
with
that
of
a
man
called
herries
but
dove
was
stubborn
as
far
as
i
concerned
miss
madeleine
the
truth
is
i
hardly
exchanged
a
word
with
guest
since
spring
into
his
friendship
with
miss
dufrayer
i
have
never
felt
it
my
business
to
inquire
i
believe
from
hearsay
that
he
is
much
changed
and
i
feel
convinced
his
prufung
will
be
poor
indeed
i
not
sure
that
he
should
not
be
warned
off
it
altogether
could
that
not
be
laid
before
him
i
should
not
care
to
undertake
it
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
with
dove
madeleine
felt
that
she
was
wasting
her
breath
and
they
walked
across
the
broad
centre
of
the
rossplatz
in
silence
do
you
never
think
she
said
after
a
time
how
it
would
simplify
life
if
we
were
able
to
get
above
it
for
a
bit
and
see
things
without
prejudice
here
a
case
now
where
a
little
real
fellowship
and
sympathy
might
work
wonders
but
no
no
interference
that
the
chief
and
only
consideration
it
had
stopped
raining
dove
let
down
his
umbrella
and
carried
it
stiffly
at
some
distance
from
him
by
reason
of
its
dampness
believe
me
miss
madeleine
he
said
as
he
emerged
from
beneath
it
believe
me
i
make
all
allowance
for
your
feelings
which
do
you
credit
a
woman
way
of
looking
at
these
things
is
thank
god
humaner
than
ours
but
it
a
man
duty
not
to
let
his
feelings
run
away
with
him
i
agree
with
you
that
it
a
shocking
affair
but
guest
went
into
it
with
his
eyes
open
and
that
he
could
do
so
but
there
was
always
something
a
little
a
little
peculiar
about
guest
i
suppose
there
was
one
can
only
be
thankful
i
suppose
that
more
or
less
of
an
exception
among
his
own
countrymen
i
mean
of
course
englishmen
are
not
as
a
rule
given
to
that
kind
of
thing
thank
god
they
not
said
dove
with
emotion
we
our
ways
part
here
said
madeleine
and
halted
as
she
took
her
music
from
him
she
asked
by
the
way
when
shall
we
be
at
liberty
to
congratulate
you
it
was
not
at
all
by
the
way
to
dove
however
he
only
smiled
for
he
had
grown
wiser
and
no
longer
wore
his
heart
on
his
you
shall
be
one
of
the
first
to
hear
miss
madeleine
when
the
news
is
made
public
thanks
greatly
oh
no
stop
a
moment
cried
madeleine
it
was
more
than
she
could
bear
to
see
him
turn
away
thus
beaming
with
stop
a
moment
you
wo
mind
my
telling
you
i
sure
that
i
been
disappointed
with
you
this
afternoon
for
i
always
thought
of
you
as
a
saviour
in
the
hour
of
need
do
you
know
one
does
indulge
in
these
fancy
pictures
of
one
friends
a
strong
man
helping
with
tact
and
example
and
here
you
go
toppling
my
picture
over
without
the
least
well
you
know
your
own
business
best
i
suppose
but
it
unkind
of
you
all
the
same
to
destroy
an
illusion
one
has
few
enough
of
them
in
this
she
laughed
satirically
and
turned
on
her
heel
regardless
of
the
effect
of
her
words
but
dove
was
not
offended
on
the
contrary
he
felt
rather
flattered
he
did
not
of
course
care
in
the
least
about
what
madeleine
called
her
illusions
but
the
mental
portrait
she
had
drawn
of
him
corresponded
exactly
to
that
attitude
in
which
he
was
fondest
of
contemplating
himself
for
it
could
honestly
be
said
that
hitherto
no
one
had
ever
applied
to
him
for
aid
in
vain
he
was
always
ready
both
with
his
time
and
with
good
advice
and
the
idea
that
in
the
present
instance
he
was
being
untrue
to
himself
in
other
words
that
he
was
letting
an
opportunity
slip
ended
by
upsetting
him
altogether
until
now
he
had
not
regarded
maurice
and
maurice
doings
from
this
point
of
view
by
nature
dove
was
opposed
to
excess
of
any
kind
his
was
a
clean
strong
mind
which
caused
him
instinctively
to
draw
back
from
everything
in
morals
as
in
art
that
passed
a
certain
limit
nothing
on
earth
would
have
persuaded
him
to
discuss
his
quondam
friend
backsliding
with
madeleine
wade
he
was
impregnated
with
the
belief
that
such
matters
were
unfit
for
virtuous
women
ears
and
he
applied
his
conviction
indiscriminately
now
however
the
notion
of
maurice
as
a
poor
erring
sheep
waiting
as
it
were
to
be
saved
this
idea
was
of
undeniable
attractiveness
to
dove
and
the
more
he
revolved
it
the
more
convinced
he
grew
of
its
truth
but
he
had
reasons
for
hesitating
having
valiantly
overcome
his
own
disappointments
first
in
the
case
of
ephie
then
of
pretty
susie
he
now
in
his
third
suit
was
on
the
brink
of
success
the
object
of
his
present
attachment
was
a
scotch
lady
no
longer
in
her
first
youth
and
several
years
older
than
himself
but
of
striking
appearance
vivacious
manners
and
if
report
spoke
true
considerable
fortune
her
appearance
in
leipzig
was
due
to
the
sudden
burst
of
energy
which
often
inspires
a
woman
of
the
scotch
nation
when
she
feels
her
youth
escaping
her
miss
maccallum
who
was
abroad
nominally
to
acquire
the
language
was
accompanied
by
her
aged
father
and
mother
and
it
was
with
these
two
old
people
that
it
behoved
dove
to
ingratiate
himself
for
according
to
the
patriarchal
habits
of
their
race
the
former
still
guided
and
determined
their
daughter
mode
of
life
as
though
she
were
thirteen
instead
of
thirty
dove
was
obliged
to
be
of
the
utmost
circumspection
in
his
behaviour
for
the
old
couple
uprooted
violently
from
their
native
soil
lived
in
a
mild
but
constant
horror
at
the
iniquity
of
foreign
ways
they
held
the
profession
of
music
to
be
an
unworthy
one
and
threw
up
their
hands
in
dismay
at
the
number
of
young
people
here
complacently
devoting
themselves
to
such
a
frivolous
object
it
was
necessary
for
dove
to
prove
to
them
that
a
student
of
music
might
yet
be
a
man
of
untarnished
principles
and
blame
less
honour
and
he
did
not
find
the
task
a
hard
one
the
whole
bent
of
his
mind
was
towards
sobriety
he
frequented
the
american
church
with
his
new
friends
on
sunday
after
noon
gave
up
skating
on
that
day
went
with
the
old
gentleman
to
motets
and
passions
and
eschewed
the
opera
but
now
his
ambition
had
been
insidiously
roused
and
day
by
day
it
grew
stronger
if
only
the
affair
with
maurice
had
not
been
of
so
unsavoury
a
nature
did
he
dove
become
seriously
involved
it
might
be
difficult
to
prove
to
judges
so
severe
as
his
future
that
he
had
acted
out
of
pure
goodness
of
heart
for
that
he
would
be
embroiled
in
other
words
that
he
would
have
success
in
his
mission
there
was
no
manner
of
doubt
in
his
mind
a
conviction
he
shared
with
the
generality
of
mankind
that
it
is
only
necessary
for
an
eyes
to
be
opened
to
the
enormity
of
his
wrongdoing
for
him
to
be
reasonable
and
to
renounce
it
while
dove
hesitated
thus
torn
between
his
reputation
on
the
one
hand
his
missionary
zeal
on
the
other
while
he
hesitated
an
incident
occurred
which
acted
as
a
kind
of
moral
fingerpost
in
the
one
day
just
as
dove
was
about
to
leave
the
room
schwarz
asked
him
if
he
were
not
a
friend
of
herr
guest
the
latter
had
been
absent
now
from
two
lessons
in
succession
was
he
ill
did
no
one
know
what
had
happened
to
him
dove
made
light
of
the
friendship
but
volunteered
his
services
and
was
bidden
to
make
inquiries
he
went
that
afternoon
frau
krause
looked
a
little
gruffer
than
of
old
and
left
him
to
find
his
own
way
to
maurice
room
in
accordance
with
the
new
state
of
things
dove
knocked
ceremoniously
at
the
door
while
his
knuckles
still
touched
the
wood
it
was
flung
open
and
he
stood
face
to
face
with
maurice
for
a
moment
the
latter
did
not
seem
to
recognise
his
visitor
he
had
evidently
been
expecting
some
one
else
then
he
repaired
his
tardiness
ceased
to
hold
the
door
and
dove
entered
apologising
for
his
intrusion
just
a
moment
i
wo
detain
you
as
you
were
absent
from
the
class
all
last
week
schwarz
asked
if
you
were
ill
and
i
said
i
would
step
round
and
see
very
good
of
you
i
sure
sit
down
said
maurice
his
face
changed
as
he
spoke
a
look
of
relief
and
at
the
same
time
of
disappointment
flitted
across
it
thanks
if
i
am
not
disturbing
you
answered
dove
as
he
said
these
words
he
threw
a
glance
the
significance
of
which
might
have
been
grasped
by
a
babe
at
the
piano
it
had
plainly
not
been
opened
that
day
maurice
understood
no
i
was
not
practising
he
said
but
i
have
to
go
out
shortly
and
he
looked
at
his
watch
quite
so
very
good
i
wo
detain
you
repeated
dove
and
sat
down
on
the
proffered
chair
but
not
practising
my
dear
fellow
how
is
that
are
you
so
far
forward
already
that
it
is
necessary
or
is
it
a
fact
that
you
are
not
feeling
up
to
the
mark
oh
i
all
right
i
get
my
work
over
in
the
morning
now
he
too
sat
down
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
clearing
his
throat
dove
gazed
at
the
sinner
before
him
he
began
to
see
that
his
errand
was
not
going
to
be
an
easy
one
where
no
hint
was
taken
it
was
difficult
to
insert
even
the
thinnest
edge
of
the
wedge
he
resolved
to
use
finesse
and
for
several
of
the
precious
moments
at
his
disposal
he
talked
as
if
at
random
of
other
things
maurice
tapped
the
table
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
dove
face
as
though
he
were
drinking
in
his
companion
solemn
utterances
in
reality
whole
minutes
passed
without
his
knowing
what
was
said
at
dove
knock
he
had
been
certain
that
a
message
had
come
from
louise
at
last
this
was
the
night
of
the
ball
and
still
she
had
given
him
no
promise
that
she
would
not
go
they
had
parted
the
evening
before
after
a
bitter
quarrel
and
he
had
left
her
vowing
that
he
would
not
return
till
she
sent
for
him
he
had
waited
the
whole
day
in
vain
for
a
sign
what
was
dove
with
his
pompous
twaddle
to
him
every
slight
sound
on
the
stairs
or
in
the
passage
meant
more
he
was
listening
listening
without
cessation
when
he
came
back
to
himself
he
heard
dove
droning
on
like
a
machine
that
has
been
wound
up
and
can
not
stop
now
i
hope
you
wo
mind
my
saying
so
were
the
next
words
that
pierced
his
brain
you
must
not
be
offended
at
my
telling
you
but
you
are
hardly
fulfilling
the
expectations
we
your
friends
you
know
had
formed
of
you
my
dear
fellow
you
really
must
pull
yourself
together
or
february
will
find
you
still
unprepared
maurice
went
a
shade
paler
he
was
clear
now
as
to
the
object
of
dove
visit
but
he
answered
in
an
way
oh
there
time
enough
yet
no
that
a
mistaken
point
of
view
if
i
may
say
so
replied
dove
in
his
blandest
manner
time
requires
to
be
taken
by
the
forelock
you
know
does
it
maurice
allowed
the
smile
that
was
expected
of
him
to
cross
his
face
most
emphatically
and
we
of
yours
are
not
the
only
people
who
have
noticed
a
certain
what
shall
i
say
a
certain
abatement
of
energy
on
your
part
schwarz
sees
it
too
or
i
am
much
mistaken
what
he
too
said
maurice
and
pretended
a
mild
surprise
for
some
seconds
now
he
had
been
mentally
debating
with
himself
whether
he
should
not
there
and
then
show
dove
the
door
he
decided
against
it
a
damn
your
interference
meant
on
both
sides
it
meant
a
bandying
of
words
and
more
expenditure
of
strength
than
he
had
to
spare
for
dove
once
more
he
drew
out
and
consulted
his
watch
unfortunately
yes
said
dove
ignoring
the
hint
i
assume
it
from
something
he
let
drop
this
afternoon
now
you
know
your
mendelssohn
ought
to
have
been
a
brilliant
piece
of
work
yes
the
expression
is
not
too
strong
and
it
still
must
be
my
dear
guest
what
i
came
to
say
to
you
one
at
any
rate
of
the
reasons
that
brought
me
was
that
you
must
not
allow
your
interest
in
what
you
are
doing
to
flag
at
the
eleventh
hour
maurice
laughed
oh
certainly
not
most
awfully
good
of
you
to
trouble
no
trouble
at
all
dove
assured
him
he
flicked
some
dust
from
his
before
he
spoke
again
i
er
that
is
i
had
some
talk
the
other
day
with
miss
wade
indeed
replied
maurice
and
was
now
able
accurately
to
gauge
the
motor
origin
of
dove
appearance
how
is
she
how
is
madeleine
she
was
speaking
of
you
guest
she
would
i
think
like
to
see
you
yes
i
rather
neglected
her
lately
i
but
when
so
much
to
do
you
know
it
a
pity
said
dove
passing
over
the
last
words
and
nodding
his
head
sagaciously
she
a
staunch
friend
of
yours
is
miss
madeleine
i
think
it
would
be
too
much
to
say
she
was
feeling
a
little
hurt
at
your
neglect
of
her
really
i
had
no
idea
so
many
people
took
an
interest
in
me
that
is
just
where
you
are
mistaken
said
dove
warmly
we
all
do
and
for
that
very
reason
i
said
to
myself
i
will
be
spokesman
for
the
rest
i
go
to
him
and
tell
him
he
must
pull
through
and
do
himself
credit
and
schwarz
too
we
are
so
few
this
year
you
know
yes
poor
old
man
he
has
got
badly
left
yes
that
was
one
reason
and
then
but
you
assure
me
do
you
that
you
will
not
take
what
i
am
going
to
say
amiss
not
in
the
least
it
awfully
decent
of
you
but
i
sorry
to
say
my
time
up
and
every
minute
is
precious
just
now
as
you
know
yourself
he
rose
and
for
the
third
time
referred
to
his
watch
after
an
ineffectual
attempt
to
continue
dove
was
also
forced
to
rise
with
the
best
part
of
his
message
unuttered
and
maurice
hurried
him
glum
and
crestfallen
to
the
door
for
fear
of
the
still
worse
tactlessness
of
which
he
might
make
himself
guilty
they
groped
in
silence
along
the
dark
lobby
for
the
sake
of
parting
with
a
friendly
and
neutral
word
maurice
said
as
he
opened
the
door
by
the
way
i
hear
we
shall
soon
have
to
offer
congratulations
and
good
wishes
to
his
surprise
dove
who
had
already
crossed
the
threshold
looked
blank
and
drew
himself
up
indeed
he
said
and
the
tone
was
for
him
quite
short
i
the
fact
is
i
no
idea
of
what
you
are
referring
to
on
his
room
maurice
went
back
to
the
window
and
taking
up
his
former
attitude
began
to
beat
anew
that
tattoo
on
the
panes
which
had
been
his
chief
employment
during
the
day
his
eyes
were
sore
with
straining
at
the
corner
of
the
street
tired
of
looking
at
his
watch
to
see
how
the
time
passed
he
had
steadfastly
believed
that
louise
would
yield
in
this
matter
and
at
the
last
recall
him
in
a
burst
of
impulsive
regret
but
as
the
day
crawled
by
without
a
word
from
her
his
confident
conviction
weakened
and
at
the
same
time
his
resolve
not
to
go
back
till
she
sent
for
him
failed
he
repeated
in
memory
some
of
the
bitter
things
they
had
said
to
each
other
to
see
if
he
had
not
left
himself
a
loophole
of
escape
but
only
with
one
half
of
his
brain
the
other
was
persistently
occupied
with
the
emptiness
of
the
street
below
when
a
clock
struck
seven
he
could
bear
the
suspense
no
longer
he
put
on
his
hat
and
coat
and
went
out
he
felt
tired
and
unslept
and
dragged
along
as
if
his
body
were
a
weight
to
him
a
fine
snow
was
falling
which
froze
into
icicles
on
the
beards
of
the
and
on
the
glistening
pavements
the
distance
had
never
seemed
so
long
to
him
it
had
also
never
seemed
so
short
a
faint
and
foolish
hope
still
refused
to
be
extinguished
but
it
went
out
directly
he
had
unlocked
the
door
and
he
learned
what
he
had
come
to
learn
without
the
exchange
of
a
word
the
truth
met
him
that
he
should
have
been
here
hours
ago
commanding
imploring
instead
of
which
he
had
sat
at
home
nursing
a
futile
and
paltry
pride
the
room
was
warm
and
bright
with
extra
candles
it
was
also
in
that
state
of
confusion
which
accompanied
an
elaborate
toilet
on
the
part
of
louise
fully
dressed
she
stood
before
the
and
arranged
something
in
her
hair
she
did
not
turn
at
his
entrance
but
she
raised
her
eyes
and
met
his
in
the
mirror
without
pausing
in
what
she
was
doing
he
looked
over
her
shoulder
at
her
reflected
face
the
cold
steadiness
the
open
hostility
of
her
look
took
his
strength
away
he
sat
down
on
the
of
the
bed
and
put
his
head
in
his
hands
minutes
passed
and
still
he
remained
in
this
position
for
what
was
the
use
of
his
speaking
her
mind
was
made
up
nothing
would
move
her
now
then
came
the
noise
of
wheels
in
the
street
below
uncovering
his
eyes
maurice
looked
at
her
again
and
as
he
did
so
his
feelings
which
until
now
had
had
something
of
the
nature
of
a
personal
wound
gave
place
to
others
with
the
rush
of
a
storm
she
wore
the
same
sparkling
dress
as
on
the
previous
occasion
arms
and
shoulders
were
as
ruthlessly
bared
to
view
he
remembered
what
he
had
heard
said
of
her
that
night
and
felt
that
his
powers
of
endurance
were
at
an
end
with
a
stifled
exclamation
he
got
up
from
the
bed
and
going
past
her
into
the
half
of
the
room
beyond
the
screen
caught
up
the
first
object
that
came
to
hand
and
threw
it
to
the
floor
it
was
a
figure
and
broke
to
pieces
louise
gave
a
cry
and
came
running
out
to
see
what
he
had
done
are
you
mad
how
dare
you
break
my
things
she
held
a
candle
above
her
head
and
by
its
light
he
saw
in
the
skin
of
neck
and
shoulder
all
the
lines
and
folds
that
were
formed
by
the
raising
of
her
arm
he
now
saw
too
that
her
hair
was
dressed
in
a
different
way
that
her
dark
eyebrows
had
been
made
still
darker
and
that
she
was
powdered
this
discovery
had
a
peculiar
effect
on
him
it
rendered
it
easier
for
him
to
say
hard
things
to
her
at
the
same
time
it
strengthened
his
determination
not
to
let
her
go
out
of
the
house
moving
aimlessly
about
the
room
he
stumbled
against
a
chair
and
kicked
it
from
him
a
month
ago
if
some
one
had
sworn
to
me
that
you
would
treat
me
as
you
are
doing
i
should
have
laughed
in
his
face
he
said
at
last
louise
had
put
the
candle
down
and
was
standing
with
her
back
to
him
taking
up
a
pair
of
long
black
gloves
she
began
to
draw
one
over
her
hand
she
did
not
look
up
at
his
words
but
went
on
stroking
the
kid
of
the
glove
you
only
doing
it
to
revenge
yourself
i
know
that
but
what
have
i
done
that
you
should
take
less
thought
for
my
feelings
than
if
i
were
a
dog
still
she
did
not
speak
you
wo
really
go
louise
you
wo
have
the
heart
i
say
you
shall
not
go
it
will
be
the
end
the
end
of
everything
if
you
leave
the
house
she
pulled
her
dress
from
his
hand
you
out
of
your
senses
i
think
the
end
of
everything
because
for
once
i
choose
to
have
some
pleasure
on
my
own
account
any
other
man
would
be
glad
to
see
the
woman
he
professes
to
care
for
enjoy
herself
but
you
begrudge
it
to
me
you
say
my
pleasures
shall
only
come
through
you
who
have
taken
to
making
life
a
burden
to
me
ca
you
understand
that
i
glad
to
get
away
from
you
and
your
and
mean
abominable
jealousy
you
not
my
master
i
not
your
slave
she
tugged
at
a
recalcitrant
glove
it
is
absurd
she
went
on
a
moment
later
all
because
i
wish
to
go
out
alone
for
but
did
i
even
want
to
why
if
it
means
so
much
to
you
could
you
have
bought
a
ticket
and
come
too
but
no
you
would
go
yourself
and
so
i
was
not
to
go
either
it
on
a
level
with
all
your
other
behaviour
i
go
he
cried
to
watch
you
the
whole
evening
in
that
arms
no
thank
you
it
not
good
you
with
your
indecent
style
of
dancing
she
wheeled
round
as
if
the
insult
had
struck
her
and
for
a
moment
faced
him
with
open
lips
then
she
thought
better
of
it
she
laughed
derisively
with
a
wanton
undertone
in
order
to
hurt
him
you
would
at
least
have
had
me
under
your
own
eyes
as
she
spoke
she
nodded
to
the
old
woman
who
opened
the
door
to
say
that
the
droschke
waited
below
a
lace
scarf
was
lying
on
the
table
louise
twisted
it
mechanically
round
her
head
and
began
to
struggle
with
an
evening
cloak
just
as
she
had
succeeded
in
getting
it
over
her
shoulders
maurice
took
her
by
the
arms
and
bent
her
backwards
so
that
the
cloak
fell
to
the
floor
you
shall
not
go
she
stemmed
her
hands
against
him
and
determinedly
yet
with
caution
pushed
herself
free
my
dress
my
hair
how
dare
you
what
do
i
care
for
your
dress
or
your
hair
you
make
me
mad
and
what
do
i
care
whether
you
mad
or
not
take
your
hands
away
louise
for
god
sake
not
with
that
man
at
least
not
with
him
he
has
said
infamous
things
of
you
i
never
told
you
yes
i
heard
him
say
heard
him
compare
you
with
soiled
goods
he
called
louise
louise
have
you
any
more
insults
for
me
no
no
more
he
leaned
his
back
against
the
door
only
this
if
you
leave
this
room
it
the
end
she
had
picked
up
her
cloak
again
the
end
she
repeated
and
looked
contemptuously
at
him
i
should
welcome
it
if
it
but
wrong
the
end
the
real
end
came
long
ago
the
beginning
was
the
end
open
that
door
and
let
me
out
he
heard
her
go
along
the
hall
heard
the
front
door
shut
behind
her
and
after
a
pause
heard
the
deeper
tone
of
the
house
door
the
droschke
drove
away
after
that
he
stood
at
the
window
looking
out
into
the
night
behind
him
the
landlady
set
the
room
in
order
and
extinguished
the
additional
candles
when
she
had
finished
and
shut
the
door
maurice
faced
the
empty
room
his
eyes
ranged
slowly
over
it
and
he
made
a
vague
gesture
that
signified
nothing
a
few
steps
took
him
to
the
on
which
her
muff
was
lying
he
lifted
it
up
and
a
bunch
of
violets
fell
into
his
hand
they
brought
her
before
him
as
nothing
else
could
have
done
beside
the
bed
he
went
down
on
his
knees
and
drawing
her
pillow
to
him
pressed
it
round
his
head
the
end
the
end
the
beginning
the
end
there
was
truth
in
what
she
had
said
their
love
had
had
no
stamina
in
it
no
vital
power
he
was
losing
her
steadily
and
surely
losing
her
powerless
to
help
it
rather
it
seemed
as
if
some
malignant
spirit
urged
him
to
hasten
on
the
crisis
their
thoughts
seemed
hopelessly
at
and
yet
how
he
loved
her
he
made
himself
no
illusions
about
her
now
he
understood
just
what
she
was
and
what
she
would
always
be
the
many
conflicting
impulses
of
her
nature
lay
bare
to
him
but
he
loved
her
loved
her
all
the
dead
weight
of
his
physical
craving
for
her
was
on
him
again
confounding
overmastering
none
the
less
she
had
left
him
she
had
no
need
for
him
and
the
hours
would
come
oftener
and
oftener
when
she
could
do
without
him
when
as
now
she
voluntarily
sought
the
company
of
other
men
the
thought
suffocated
him
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
hastened
out
of
the
house
a
little
before
one
he
was
stationed
opposite
the
sideentrance
to
the
hotel
de
prusse
he
had
a
long
time
to
wait
as
two
approached
small
batches
of
people
emerged
at
first
at
intervals
then
more
and
more
frequently
among
the
last
were
herries
and
louise
maurice
remained
standing
in
the
shadow
of
some
houses
until
they
had
parted
from
their
companions
he
heard
her
voice
above
all
the
rest
it
rang
out
clear
and
resonant
just
as
on
that
former
occasion
when
she
had
drunk
freely
of
champagne
with
many
final
words
and
false
partings
she
and
herries
separated
from
the
group
and
turned
to
walk
down
the
street
as
they
did
so
maurice
sprang
out
from
his
and
was
suddenly
in
front
of
them
blocking
their
progress
at
his
unexpected
apparition
both
started
and
when
he
roughly
took
hold
of
her
arm
louise
gave
a
short
cry
herries
put
out
his
hand
and
smacked
maurice
down
what
are
you
doing
there
take
your
hands
off
this
lady
damn
you
he
cried
in
broken
german
not
recognising
maurice
and
believing
that
he
had
to
deal
with
an
ordinary
nachtschwarmer
the
savageness
with
which
he
was
turned
on
enlightened
him
damn
you
retorted
maurice
in
english
take
your
hands
off
her
yourself
i
she
belongs
to
me
to
me
do
you
hear
and
i
intend
to
keep
her
you
drunken
cur
said
herries
he
had
instinctively
allowed
louise
to
withdraw
her
arm
now
he
stood
irresolute
uncertain
how
she
would
wish
him
to
act
she
had
gone
very
pale
he
believed
she
was
afraid
there
a
droschke
anywhere
he
said
and
looked
angrily
round
i
really
ca
see
you
exposed
to
this
this
sort
of
thing
you
know
louise
answered
hurriedly
no
no
and
please
go
i
shall
be
all
right
i
i
had
enjoyed
it
so
much
i
will
tell
you
another
time
how
much
good
night
and
thank
you
no
please
yes
a
delightful
evening
her
words
were
almost
inaudible
delightful
indeed
said
herries
with
warmth
then
he
stood
aside
raised
his
hat
and
let
them
pass
maurice
had
his
hand
on
her
wrist
and
he
dragged
her
after
him
over
the
frozen
pavements
far
more
quickly
than
she
could
in
comfort
go
hampered
as
she
was
by
and
by
her
heavy
cloak
but
she
followed
him
allowed
herself
to
be
drawn
without
protest
she
felt
strangely
only
sometimes
when
the
thought
of
the
indignity
he
had
laid
upon
her
came
over
her
anew
did
she
whisper
how
dare
you
oh
how
dare
you
he
did
not
look
at
her
or
answer
her
and
all
might
have
gone
well
so
oddly
did
this
treatment
affect
her
had
he
only
persisted
in
it
but
the
mere
contact
of
her
hand
softened
him
towards
her
her
nearness
worked
on
him
as
it
never
failed
to
do
he
was
exhausted
too
mentally
and
physically
and
at
the
thought
that
for
this
night
at
least
his
sufferings
were
over
he
could
have
shed
tears
of
relief
slackening
his
pace
he
began
to
speak
began
to
excuse
and
exculpate
himself
before
ever
she
had
blamed
him
endeavouring
to
make
her
understand
something
of
what
he
had
gone
through
in
advance
and
before
she
had
expressed
it
he
sought
to
break
down
her
spirit
of
animosity
the
longer
he
spoke
the
harder
she
felt
herself
grow
he
was
at
it
again
back
at
his
eternal
oh
why
for
this
one
evening
at
least
could
he
not
have
enforced
his
will
and
have
made
her
do
what
he
wished
without
explanation
but
the
one
plain
simple
way
was
the
only
way
he
never
thought
of
taking
i
hate
you
and
despise
you
i
shall
never
forgive
you
for
your
behaviour
never
and
now
it
was
she
who
pressed
forward
to
get
away
from
him
he
turned
the
key
in
the
but
before
he
could
open
the
door
louise
pushing
in
front
of
him
threw
it
back
entered
the
house
and
the
next
moment
the
door
banged
in
his
face
he
had
just
time
to
withdraw
his
hand
he
heard
her
steps
on
the
stair
mounting
growing
fainter
he
heard
the
door
above
open
and
shut
for
a
second
or
two
he
stood
listening
to
these
sounds
but
when
it
dawned
on
him
that
she
had
shut
him
out
he
pressed
both
hands
against
the
wood
of
the
heavy
door
and
tried
to
shake
it
open
he
even
beat
his
fist
against
it
and
only
desisted
from
this
when
his
knuckles
began
to
smart
then
on
looking
down
he
saw
that
the
key
was
still
in
the
lock
he
stared
at
it
stupidly
without
understanding
but
yes
it
was
his
own
key
he
himself
had
put
it
in
he
took
it
out
again
and
holding
it
in
his
hand
looked
at
it
after
the
fashion
of
a
drunken
man
who
does
not
recognise
the
object
he
holds
and
even
while
he
did
this
he
burst
into
a
peal
of
laughter
which
made
him
lean
for
support
against
the
wall
of
the
house
the
noise
he
made
sounded
idiotic
sounded
mad
in
the
quiet
street
but
he
was
unable
to
contain
himself
she
had
left
him
the
key
had
left
the
key
oh
what
a
fool
he
was
his
laughter
died
away
he
opened
the
door
noiselessly
as
he
had
learned
by
practice
to
do
and
as
noiselessly
entered
the
vestibule
and
went
up
the
stairs
ix
several
versions
of
the
contretemps
with
herries
were
afloat
immediately
all
agreed
in
one
point
maurice
guest
had
been
in
an
advanced
stage
of
intoxication
a
scuffle
was
said
to
have
taken
place
in
the
deserted
street
there
had
been
tears
and
prayers
and
shrill
accusing
voices
in
the
version
that
reached
madeleine
cars
blows
were
mentioned
she
stood
aghast
at
the
disclosures
the
story
made
and
at
all
these
implied
until
now
maurice
had
at
least
striven
to
preserve
appearances
if
once
you
became
callous
enough
not
to
care
what
people
said
of
you
you
wilfully
made
of
yourself
a
social
outcast
that
same
afternoon
as
she
was
mounting
the
steps
of
the
conservatorium
she
came
face
to
face
with
krafft
they
had
not
met
for
weeks
and
madeleine
remarked
this
as
they
stood
together
but
she
was
not
thinking
very
deeply
of
him
or
his
affairs
and
when
she
asked
him
if
he
would
go
across
to
her
room
and
wait
for
her
there
she
was
following
an
impulse
that
had
no
connection
with
him
as
usual
krafft
had
nothing
particular
to
do
and
when
she
returned
half
an
hour
later
she
found
him
lying
on
her
sofa
with
his
arms
under
his
head
his
knees
crossed
above
him
the
air
of
the
room
was
grey
with
smoke
but
for
once
madeleine
set
no
limit
to
his
cigarettes
sitting
down
at
the
table
she
looked
meditatively
at
him
for
some
moments
neither
spoke
but
as
krafft
drew
out
his
case
to
take
another
cigarette
a
tattered
volume
of
reclam
universal
library
fell
from
his
pocket
and
spread
itself
on
the
floor
madeleine
stooped
and
pieced
it
together
what
have
we
here
ah
your
bible
she
said
sarcastically
it
was
a
novel
by
a
modern
danish
poet
who
died
young
you
carry
it
about
with
you
i
see
i
needed
stimmung
but
do
say
bible
that
an
error
of
taste
say
one
can
study
death
in
it
in
all
its
forms
to
give
you
stimmung
i
ca
understand
your
love
for
the
book
heinz
it
morbid
everything
morbid
that
the
ordinary
mortal
does
wish
to
be
reminded
of
some
day
if
i
do
turn
stoker
or
acrobat
beforehand
and
give
up
peddling
in
the
emotions
some
day
i
shall
write
music
to
it
that
would
be
a
melodrama
worth
making
morbid
heirtz
morbid
all
women
are
not
of
your
opinion
i
remember
once
hearing
a
woman
say
had
the
author
still
lived
she
would
have
pilgrimaged
barefoot
to
see
him
oh
i
dare
say
there
are
women
enough
of
that
kind
fools
of
course
extravagant
unbalanced
the
class
of
person
that
suffers
from
a
diseased
but
men
can
make
fools
of
themselves
too
there
are
specimens
enough
here
to
start
a
museum
with
of
which
you
as
normalmensch
could
be
showman
madeleine
pushed
her
chair
back
towards
the
head
of
the
sofa
so
that
she
came
to
sit
out
of
the
range
of
krafft
eyes
talking
of
fools
she
said
slowly
have
you
seen
anything
of
maurice
guest
lately
krafft
lowered
a
spike
of
ash
into
the
tray
i
have
not
yes
i
heard
he
had
got
into
a
different
hour
she
said
disconnectedly
as
however
krafft
remained
impassive
she
took
the
leap
is
there
can
nothing
be
done
for
him
heinz
here
krafft
did
just
what
she
had
expected
him
to
do
rose
on
his
elbow
and
turned
to
look
at
her
but
her
face
was
inscrutable
explain
he
said
dropping
back
into
his
former
position
oh
explain
she
echoed
firing
up
at
once
i
suppose
if
a
were
on
his
way
to
the
scaffold
you
men
would
still
ask
for
explanations
listen
to
me
you
the
only
man
here
maurice
was
at
all
friendly
with
i
should
turn
to
you
you
scoffer
you
may
be
sure
of
it
if
i
knew
of
anyone
else
he
liked
you
and
at
one
time
what
you
said
had
a
good
deal
of
influence
with
him
it
might
still
have
go
to
him
heinz
and
talk
straight
to
him
make
him
think
of
his
future
and
of
all
the
other
things
he
has
apparently
you
need
laugh
you
could
do
it
well
enough
if
you
chose
if
you
so
hideously
oh
do
laugh
like
that
you
loathsome
when
you
do
and
there
nothing
natural
about
it
but
krafft
enjoyed
himself
undisturbed
not
natural
it
ought
to
be
he
said
when
he
could
speak
again
oh
you
english
you
english
was
there
ever
a
people
like
you
do
talk
to
me
of
men
and
women
mada
only
an
englishwoman
would
look
at
the
thing
as
you
do
how
you
would
love
to
reform
and
straitlace
all
us
unregenerate
youths
you
done
your
best
for
me
in
vain
and
now
it
guest
mada
you
have
the
puritan
watery
fluid
in
your
veins
and
cain
mark
on
your
brow
the
mark
of
the
raceace
that
carries
its
sundays
its
language
its
drinks
its
dress
and
its
conventions
with
it
whereever
it
goes
and
is
surprised
and
mildly
shocked
if
these
things
are
not
instantly
adopted
by
the
poor
purblind
you
are
the
missionaries
of
the
world
oh
i
heard
all
that
before
some
day
heinz
you
really
must
come
to
england
and
revise
your
impressions
of
us
however
i
not
going
to
let
you
shirk
the
subject
i
will
tell
you
this
i
know
the
milieu
maurice
guest
has
sprung
from
and
i
can
judge
as
you
never
can
how
totally
he
is
unfitting
himself
to
return
the
way
he
going
on
i
hear
on
all
sides
that
he
never
his
prufung
now
and
you
yourself
know
his
certificate
wo
be
worth
a
straw
there
something
fascinating
i
admit
krafft
went
on
about
a
people
of
such
a
purely
practical
genius
and
it
follows
as
a
matter
of
course
that
being
the
extreme
individualists
you
are
you
should
question
the
right
of
others
to
their
particular
mode
of
existence
for
individualism
of
this
type
implies
a
training
a
culture
a
grand
style
which
it
has
taken
centuries
to
attain
we
have
still
centuries
to
go
before
we
get
there
if
we
ever
do
for
we
are
the
artists
among
nations
waxen
temperaments
formed
to
take
on
impressions
to
be
moulded
this
way
and
that
by
our
age
our
epoch
you
are
the
moralists
we
are
the
the
immoralists
if
you
like
in
your
vocabulary
that
a
synonym
for
kunstler
you
make
me
ill
heinz
kuss
die
hand
he
was
silent
following
a
with
his
eyes
seriously
mada
he
said
after
a
moment
but
there
was
no
answering
seriousness
in
his
face
which
mocked
as
usual
seriously
now
i
suppose
you
would
admit
what
this
dressur
this
hohe
schule
guest
is
going
through
might
be
of
service
to
him
in
the
end
no
indeed
i
would
she
answered
hotly
you
talk
as
if
he
were
a
think
of
him
now
and
think
of
him
as
he
was
when
he
first
came
here
a
good
fellow
was
he
and
full
to
the
brim
of
plans
and
projects
ridiculous
enough
some
of
them
but
the
great
thing
is
to
be
able
to
make
plans
as
long
as
a
man
can
do
that
on
the
upward
and
he
had
talent
you
said
so
yourself
and
unlimited
perseverance
good
god
madeleine
burst
out
krafft
that
you
should
have
been
in
this
place
as
long
as
you
have
and
still
remain
so
immaculate
surely
you
realise
that
something
more
than
talent
and
perseverance
is
necessary
one
can
have
talent
as
one
has
a
hat
use
it
or
not
as
one
i
tell
you
the
mill
guest
is
going
through
may
be
his
salvation
artistically
and
morally
asked
madeleine
not
without
bitterness
must
one
give
thanks
then
if
one
friend
does
turn
out
a
genius
krafft
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
you
take
it
the
artist
has
as
much
to
do
with
morality
as
let
us
say
your
musical
festivals
have
to
do
with
and
if
his
genius
is
strong
enough
to
float
him
he
goes
under
und
damit
basta
the
better
for
art
there
are
bunglers
but
i
tell
you
this
he
rose
on
his
elbow
again
and
spoke
more
warmly
since
i
seen
what
our
friend
is
capable
of
how
he
has
allowed
himself
to
be
absorbed
since
in
short
he
has
behaved
in
such
a
highly
way
well
since
then
i
have
some
hope
of
him
he
seems
open
to
and
impressions
are
the
only
things
that
matter
to
the
artist
oh
do
go
on
please
i
sick
to
death
of
the
very
words
art
and
artist
cheer
up
mada
you
nothing
of
the
kind
in
your
blood
he
stretched
himself
and
yawned
nor
has
he
either
i
believe
a
face
may
deceive
and
a
clear
head
and
unlimited
perseverance
and
intelligence
and
ambition
none
of
these
things
is
enough
the
lord
asks
more
of
his
chosen
madeleine
clasped
her
hands
behind
her
head
and
tilted
back
her
chair
so
you
could
interfere
i
see
your
artistic
conscience
would
forbid
it
why
do
you
do
it
yourself
he
scrutinised
her
face
with
a
sarcastic
smile
oh
say
it
out
i
know
what
you
think
and
am
i
not
right
no
you
not
how
i
hate
the
construction
you
put
on
things
in
your
eyes
nothing
is
pure
or
disinterested
you
ca
even
imagine
to
yourself
a
friendship
between
a
man
and
a
woman
such
a
thing
known
here
in
your
nation
of
artists
your
men
are
too
inflammatory
and
too
to
want
their
calves
fatted
for
any
but
the
one
sacrifice
girls
have
their
very
tied
on
them
with
an
undermeaning
and
poor
souls
who
can
blame
them
for
submitting
what
a
fate
is
theirs
if
they
do
manage
to
catch
a
man
gossip
and
needlework
are
only
slow
poison
now
you
spiteful
but
i
tell
you
something
such
friendships
as
you
speak
of
are
only
possible
where
the
woman
is
old
or
ugly
or
abnormal
in
some
way
a
or
a
clever
woman
or
some
other
freak
of
nature
now
our
women
are
as
a
rule
sexually
healthy
they
know
what
they
here
for
too
and
are
not
ashamed
of
it
also
they
still
have
their
share
of
physical
attraction
while
yours
good
god
i
wonder
you
manage
to
keep
the
breed
going
stop
heinz
said
madeleine
sternly
you
are
illogical
and
indecent
and
you
know
there
a
limit
i
do
choose
to
let
you
you
wrong
too
you
only
to
look
about
you
here
with
unbiassed
eyes
to
see
which
race
the
prettiest
girls
belong
but
never
mind
you
only
launch
out
in
this
way
that
you
may
not
be
obliged
to
discuss
maurice
guest
i
know
you
i
can
read
you
like
a
book
you
are
not
very
old
or
ugly
or
abnormal
mada
she
smiled
in
spite
of
herself
and
are
we
not
friends
pray
something
that
but
in
all
you
say
about
guest
the
impersonal
note
is
wanting
you
jealous
i
nothing
of
the
sort
but
you
at
least
allow
me
to
resent
seeing
a
friend
of
mine
in
the
claws
of
this
this
vampire
krafft
laughed
vampire
is
good
a
poor
distraught
spare
your
phrases
heinz
she
bad
through
and
through
and
stupid
into
the
bargain
lulu
stupid
ei
ei
mada
your
eyes
are
indeed
askew
she
has
a
touch
of
the
other
extreme
of
genius
na
well
if
this
is
another
of
your
manifestations
of
genius
then
permit
me
to
hate
no
to
loathe
it
in
all
its
forms
ganz
nach
belieben
it
a
privilege
of
your
sex
you
know
there
never
was
a
woman
yet
who
did
prefer
a
good

talent
a
crack
this
way
and
it
madness
that
and
the
world
says
genius
and
some
people
have
a
peculiar
gift
for
discovering
it
those
who
set
themselves
to
it
can
find
genius
in
a
flea
jump
but
has
it
never
occurred
to
you
that
the
power
of
loving
that
some
women
have
a
genius
for
loving
no
why
do
i
ask
for
if
i
am
a
book
you
are
a
poster
a
placard
what
a
people
you
are
for
words
you
make
phrases
about
everything
that
a
ridiculous
thing
to
say
if
every
fickle
woman
fickle
woman
fickle
he
interrupted
that
only
a
tag
the
people
whose
business
it
is
to
decide
these
things
die

are
not
agreed
to
this
day
whet
it
man
who
fickle
or
woman
in
this
mood
it
one
in
that
the

and
the
silly
world
bleats
it
after
them
like
sheep
well
if
you
wish
me
to
put
it
more
plainly
if
what
you
say
were
true
vice
would
be
condoned
vice
he
cried
with
derision
and
sat
up
and
faced
her
vice
my
dear
mada
sweet
innocent
child
no
no
a
special
talent
is
needed
for
that
kind
of
thing
an
unlimited
capacity
for
suffering
an
entire
renunciation
of
what
is
commonly
called
happiness
you
hold
the
good
old
philistine
opinions
you
think
no
doubt
of
two
lovers
living
together
in
delirious
pleasure
in
saus
und
nothing
could
be
falser
a
woman
only
needs
to
have
the
higher
want
in
her
nature
and
the
suffering
is
there
too
she
born
gifted
with
the
faculty
and
a
woman
of
the
type
we
speaking
of
is
as
often
as
not
the
flower
of
her
or
becomes
for
see
all
she
gains
on
her
way
the
mere
passing
from
hand
to
hand
the
intense
impressionable
nature
the
process
of
being
moulded
why
even
the
common
prostitute
gets
a
certain
manly
breadth
of
mind
such
as
you
other
women
never
arrive
at
each
one
who
comes
and
goes
leaves
her
something
an
experience
a
turn
of
thought
it
may
be
only
an
intuition
which
she
has
not
had
before
and
the
contamination
the
soul
cried
madeleine
two
red
spots
had
come
out
on
her
cheeks
as
you
understand
it
such
a
woman
has
no
soul
and
does
need
one
all
she
needs
is
tact
and
taste
you
are
the
eternal
scoffer
i
never
was
more
serious
in
my
but
let
us
put
it
another
way
what
does
a
what
does
any
beautiful
woman
want
with
a
soul
or
brains
or
morals
or
whatever
you
choose
to
call
it
let
her
give
thanks
night
and
day
that
she
is
what
she
is
one
of
the
few
perfect
things
on
this
imperfect
earth
let
her
care
for
her
beauty
and
treasure
it
and
serve
it
time
enough
when
it
is
gone
to
cultivate
the
soul
if
indeed
she
does
bury
herself
alive
as
it
her
duty
to
do
instead
of
decaying
publicly
mada
do
you
know
a
more
disgusting
more
humiliating
sight
than
the
sagging
of
the
skin
on
a
neck
that
was
once
like
marble
than
a
mouth
visibly
losing
its
form
the
slender
shoulders
we
have
adored
broadening
into
massivity
all
the
fine
spiritual
delicacy
of
youth
being
touched
to
heaviness
all
the
barbarous
cruelty
in
short
with
which
before
our
eyes
time
treats
the
woman
who
is
no
longer
no
no
as
long
as
she
has
her
beauty
a
woman
is
under
no
necessity
to
bolster
up
her
conscience
or
to
be
reasonable
or
to
think
god
forbid
there
are
plain
women
enough
for
that
we
do
ask
our
lady
of
milo
to
be
witty
for
us
or
to
solve
us
problems
believe
me
there
is
more
thought
more
eloquence
in
the
corners
of
a
beautiful
mouth
the
upward
look
of
two
dark
eyes
than
in
all
women
have
said
or
done
from
sappho
down
springy
colour
light
music
perfume
they
are
all
to
be
found
in
the
curves
of
a
perfect
throat
or
arm
madeleine
silence
bristled
with
irony
and
that
he
went
on
was
where
the
girl
you
are
blaspheming
had
such
exquisite
tact
she
knew
this
her
instinct
taught
her
what
was
required
of
her
she
would
fall
into
an
attitude
and
remain
motionless
in
it
as
if
she
knew
the
eye
must
feast
its
full
or
if
she
did
move
and
speak
for
she
too
had
hours
of
a
desperate
garrulity
then
one
was
content
as
well
her
vitality
was
so
intense
that
her
whole
body
spoke
when
her
lips
did
she
would
pass
so
rapidly
from
one
position
to
another
that
you
had
to
shut
your
eyes
for
fear
that
out
of
all
this
multitude
you
would
not
be
able
to
carry
one
away
with
if
some
of
her
ways
of
expressing
herself
in
motion
could
be
caught
and
fixed
a
sculptor
fame
would
be
a
painter
if
he
could
reproduce
the
trick
she
has
of
smiling
entirely
with
her
eyes
and
and
then
her
hands
mada
i
wonder
you
other
women
do
weep
for
envy
of
them
she
has
only
to
raise
them
to
pass
them
over
her
forehead
or
to
finger
at
her
hair
and
the
world
is
do
you
really
think
a
man
asks
soul
of
a
woman
with
such
eyes
and
hand
as
those
good
god
no
he
worships
her
and
adores
her
were
is
only
one
place
for
him
and
that
on
his
knees
before
her
well
really
heinz
said
madeleine
and
the
spots
on
her
cheeks
burnt
a
dull
red
in
imagination
do
you
know
i
carried
just
three
years
backwards
do
you
remember
that
spring
evening
when
you
came
rushing
in
here
to
me
seen
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
world
and
i
drunk
with
her
and
how
i
could
understand
for
i
thought
her
plain
just
as
i
still
but
then
if
i
remember
aright
your
admiration
was
by
no
means
the
platonic
artistic
affair
it
hm
is
now
it
was
but
now
you
understand
mada
that
i
think
a
man
makes
a
good
exchange
of
career
and
success
and
other
such
accidents
of
his
material
existence
for
the
right
to
touch
these
hands
at
will
the
one
thing
necessary
is
that
he
be
fit
for
the
post
i
demand
of
him
that
he
be
a
gourmand
a
connoisseur
in
beauty
and
it
here
mind
you
that
i
have
doubts
of
our
is
it
clear
to
you
as
clear
as
day
thanks
and
you
may
be
quite
sure
of
me
never
applying
to
you
for
help
again
i
shall
respect
your
principles
and
mind
you
i
do
say
guest
may
not
come
out
of
the
affair
all
right
enriched
for
the
rest
of
his
life
very
good
and
now
you
may
go
i
regret
that
i
ever
bothered
with
you
krafft
went
across
to
where
madeleine
was
standing
put
his
hands
on
her
two
shoulders
and
laid
his
head
on
his
right
arm
so
that
she
who
was
taller
than
he
was
looked
down
on
the
roundnesses
of
his
curly
hair
you
a
good
fellow
mada
a
good
fellow
ja
ja
who
knows
if
you
had
had
just
a
little
more
of
the
ewigweibliche
about
you
too
much
honour
but
you
do
expect
englishwomen
to
join
your
harem
do
you
there
would
have
been
a
certain
repose
in
belonging
to
a
woman
of
your
type
but
it
the
charm
physical
charm
we
poor
wretches
ca
do
without
upon
my
word
it
almost
a
declaration
cried
madeleine
not
unnettled
take
my
advice
heinz
hie
you
home
and
marry
the
person
you
ought
to
take
pity
on
the
poor
thing
constancy
unless
she
added
a
moment
later
with
a
sarcastic
laugh
since
you
still
so
infatuated
with
louise
you
persuade
her
to
transfer
her
favours
to
you
that
would
solve
all
difficulties
in
the
most
satisfactory
way
she
would
have
the
variety
that
seems
necessary
to
her
existence
you
could
lie
on
your
knees
before
her
all
day
long
and
our
friend
would
be
restored
to
sanity
think
it
over
heinz
it
a
good
idea
do
you
think
she
have
me
he
asked
as
he
shook
himself
into
his
coat
heaven
knows
and
heaven
only
where
louise
is
concerned
impossible
i
always
maintained
it
well
you
shall
have
early
news
i
promise
you
madeleine
heard
him
go
down
the
stair
whistling
the
rose
of
sharon
but
he
could
not
have
been
to
the
bottom
when
he
turned
and
came
back
holding
her
door
ajar
he
stuck
a
laughing
face
into
the
room
upon
my
word
mada
i
congratulate
you
it
a
colossal
idea
but
madeleine
had
had
enough
of
him
i
glad
it
pleases
you
now
go
go
you
played
the
fool
here
long
enough
when
he
emerged
from
the
house
krafft
had
stopped
whistling
he
walked
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
felt
hat
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
at
the
corner
he
was
so
lost
in
thought
as
to
be
unable
to
guide
his
feet
he
stood
and
gazed
at
the
pavement
still
on
the
same
spot
he
pushed
his
hat
to
the
back
of
his
head
and
burst
into
such
an
eerie
peal
of
laughter
that
some
ladies
who
were
coming
towards
him
started
back
and
picking
up
their
skirts
went
off
the
pavement
in
order
to
avoid
passing
him
too
nearly
the
following
afternoon
at
an
hour
when
maurice
was
safely
out
of
the
way
krafft
climbed
the
stair
to
the
house
in
the
bruderstrasse
the
landlady
did
not
know
him
yes
fraulein
was
at
home
she
said
but
krafft
promptly
entered
and
himself
closed
the
door
outside
louise
room
he
listened
with
bent
head
having
satisfied
himself
he
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
and
went
in
louise
stood
at
the
window
watching
the
snow
fall
it
had
snowed
uninterruptedly
since
early
morning
out
of
the
leaden
sky
flake
after
flake
fluttered
down
whirled
spun
and
became
part
of
the
fallen
mass
at
the
opening
of
the
door
she
did
not
stir
for
it
would
only
be
maurice
coming
back
to
ask
forgiveness
and
she
was
too
unspeakably
tired
to
begin
all
over
again
krafft
stood
and
eyed
her
from
the
crown
of
her
rough
head
to
the
bedraggled
tail
of
the
gruss
gott
lulu
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
she
jumped
round
with
a
scream
you
heinz
you
the
blood
suffused
her
face
a
purplish
red
her
voice
was
shrill
with
dismay
her
eyes
hung
on
the
young
man
as
though
he
were
a
returning
spirit
with
an
effort
she
got
the
better
of
her
first
fright
and
took
a
step
towards
him
how
dare
you
come
into
this
room
krafft
hung
his
wet
coat
over
the
back
of
a
chair
and
wiped
his
face
dry
of
the
melted
snow
no
heroics
lulu
but
she
could
not
contain
herself
oh
how
dare
you
it
a
mean
dishonourable
trick
only
you
would
do
it
sit
down
and
listen
to
what
i
have
to
say
it
wo
take
long
and
it
to
your
own
advantage
i
think
not
to
make
a
may
i
smoke
she
obeyed
taking
the
nearest
chair
for
she
had
begun
to
tremble
her
legs
shook
under
her
but
when
he
held
out
the
case
of
cigarettes
to
her
she
struck
it
and
the
contents
were
spilled
on
the
floor
look
here
lulu
he
said
and
crossing
his
legs
put
one
hand
in
his
pocket
while
with
the
other
he
made
gestures
suitable
to
his
words
i
not
come
here
to
rake
up
old
sores
time
has
gone
over
them
and
healed
them
and
it
only
your
nebenbei
gesagt
extremely
that
makes
you
afraid
of
me
i
not
here
for
myself
but
heinz
the
cry
escaped
her
against
her
will
for
him
you
come
from
him
he
removed
his
cigarette
and
smiled
him
which
which
of
them
do
you
mean
which
it
was
another
uncontrollable
exclamation
then
the
expression
of
almost
savage
joy
that
had
lighted
up
her
face
died
out
oh
i
know
you
know
you
and
hate
you
heinz
i
never
hated
anyone
as
much
as
you
and
a
woman
of
your
temperament
hates
uncommonly
no
all
jokes
aside
the
word
cut
her
he
saw
this
and
repeated
it
joking
apart
i
come
to
you
merely
to
ask
if
you
do
think
your
present
little
affair
has
gone
far
enough
she
was
as
composed
as
he
was
what
business
is
it
of
yours
oh
none
except
that
the
poor
fool
was
once
my
friend
she
gave
a
daring
laugh
full
of
suggestion
but
krafft
was
not
put
out
by
it
do
do
that
again
he
said
it
sounds
ugly
and
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
ugliness
you
know
no
i
repeat
once
more
this
is
not
a
personal
matter
and
you
expect
me
to
believe
that
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
was
now
she
who
smiled
derisively
have
you
forgotten
a
certain
evening
in
this
room
three
years
ago
but
he
did
not
flinch
upon
my
word
if
you
are
bold
enough
to
recall
that
however
the
reminder
was
unnecessary
tell
me
now
are
you
about
done
with
guest
for
still
a
moment
she
fought
to
keep
up
her
show
of
dignity
then
she
broke
down
heinz
oh
i
do
know
oh
yes
yes
yes
a
thousand
times
yes
oh
i
so
tired
i
ca
tell
you
how
tired
i
am
of
the
very
sight
of
him
i
never
wanted
him
believe
me
i
did
he
thrust
himself
on
me
it
was
not
my
doing
oh
come
now
tell
that
to
some
one
else
yes
i
know
you
only
think
the
worst
of
me
but
though
i
was
weak
and
yielded
anyone
would
have
done
the
same
he
gave
me
no
but
i
been
punished
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
little
bit
of
happiness
it
brought
me
there
no
more
miserable
creature
alive
than
i
am
what
interests
me
continued
krafft
in
a
tone
is
how
you
came
to
choose
so
far
afield
from
your
particular
type
well
enough
represented
here
she
saw
the
folly
of
wasting
herself
upon
him
and
gave
a
deep
sigh
then
however
the
same
wild
change
as
before
came
over
her
face
stooping
she
took
his
hand
and
fondled
it
heinz
now
that
you
here
do
one
thing
only
one
for
me
have
pity
on
me
i
gone
through
so
much
been
so
unhappy
tell
me
only
one
thing
i
want
to
know
where
is
he
will
he
never
come
back
for
you
know
you
must
know
you
have
seen
him
she
had
sunk
to
her
knees
her
head
was
bent
over
his
hand
she
laid
her
cheek
against
it
krafft
considered
her
thoughtfully
his
eye
dwelt
with
approval
on
the
broad
slender
shoulders
the
lithe
neck
all
the
sure
grace
of
the
crouching
body
will
you
do
something
for
me
lulu
anything
then
let
your
hair
down
he
himself
drew
out
the
pins
and
combs
that
held
it
and
the
black
mass
fell
and
lay
in
wide
generous
waves
round
face
and
neck
that
the
idea
now
go
on
louise
kissed
his
hand
tell
me
you
must
know
but
is
it
possible
that
still
interests
you
oh
no
my
life
depends
on
it
that
all
you
are
cruel
and
bad
but
still
i
can
speak
to
you
for
months
now
i
have
had
a
soul
to
speak
to
be
kind
to
me
this
once
heinz
i
ca
go
on
living
without
him
i
have
lived
since
he
left
me
not
an
hour
oh
you
my
last
hope
you
have
plenty
of
hopes
in
your
life
yet
in
those
old
days
you
hated
me
too
but
do
bear
malice
now
there
nothing
i
wo
do
for
you
if
you
tell
me
i
never
speak
to
never
even
think
of
you
again
i
not
so
then
you
wo
tell
me
i
did
say
that
she
crushed
his
hand
between
hers
here
the
chance
you
asked
for
to
save
your
friend
oh
wo
you
understand
an
inward
satisfaction
of
which
only
he
himself
knew
the
cause
warmed
krafft
through
at
seeing
her
prostrate
before
him
but
as
he
continued
to
look
at
her
a
thought
crossed
his
mind
and
quickly
resolved
he
laid
his
cigarette
on
the
table
and
put
his
hands
first
on
her
head
amid
the
tempting
confusion
of
her
hair
which
met
them
like
a
thick
stuff
pleasant
to
the
touch
and
from
there
to
her
shoulders
inclining
her
towards
him
she
looked
up
and
though
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
her
white
face
was
alight
in
an
instant
with
hope
again
as
he
said
would
you
do
something
else
for
me
if
i
told
you
she
strained
back
so
that
she
might
see
his
face
heinz
what
is
it
and
then
with
a
sudden
gasp
of
comprehension
oh
if
that
all
i
will
never
see
maurice
guest
again
that
not
it
what
is
it
then
will
you
listen
quietly
yes
yes
she
ceased
to
draw
back
let
herself
be
held
but
he
felt
her
trembling
he
whispered
a
few
words
in
her
ear
almost
simultaneously
she
jerked
her
head
away
and
turning
a
dark
red
stared
incredulously
at
him
then
she
sprang
to
her
feet
oh
what
a
fool
i
am
to
believe
for
one
instant
there
was
a
human
spot
in
you
i
could
get
at
take
your
hands
away
take
them
off
me
because
i
had
no
one
to
speak
to
for
so
long
because
i
know
you
could
understand
if
you
would
oh
when
a
woman
is
down
anyone
may
hit
her
gently
gently
you
too
good
for
such
phrases
i
no
different
from
other
women
it
only
you
with
your
horrible
thoughts
of
me
you
why
you
no
more
to
me
than
the
floor
i
stand
on
and
matters
are
simplified
by
that
very
i
can
give
you
his
address
lulu
go
away
i
may
hurt
you
i
could
kill
go
away
and
this
said
krafft
as
he
put
on
his
coat
again
is
how
a
woman
listens
quietly
well
lulu
think
it
over
a
word
at
any
time
will
bring
me
if
you
change
your
mind
one
evening
about
a
week
later
maurice
entered
seyffert
cafe
the
heavy
snowfall
had
been
succeeded
by
a
period
of
thaw
of
slush
and
gloom
and
on
this
particular
night
a
keen
wind
had
risen
making
the
streets
seem
doubly
cheerless
it
was
close
on
nine
and
seyffert
was
crowded
with
its
usual
guests
young
people
who
had
escaped
from
more
or
less
dingy
rooms
to
the
warmth
and
light
of
the
cafe
where
the
yellow
blinds
were
drawn
against
the
inclement
night
the
billiard
table
in
the
centre
was
never
free
those
players
whose
turn
had
not
yet
come
or
was
over
stood
round
it
cigarette
or
large
black
cigar
in
hand
and
watched
the
game
maurice
had
difficulty
in
finding
a
seat
when
he
did
it
was
at
a
table
for
two
in
a
corner
a
youth
who
had
already
eaten
his
supper
sat
alone
there
picking
his
teeth
maurice
took
the
opposite
chair
and
made
his
evening
meal
with
a
languid
appetite
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
was
a
large
and
boisterous
party
whose
leader
was
krafft
krafit
in
his
most
outrageous
mood
every
other
minute
his
sallies
evoked
roars
of
laughter
maurice
refrained
from
glancing
in
that
direction
when
however
his
got
up
and
went
away
he
was
startled
from
his
conning
of
the
afternoon
paper
by
seeing
krafft
before
him
the
latter
who
carried
his
in
his
hand
took
the
vacated
scat
nodded
and
smiled
maurice
was
on
his
guard
at
once
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
were
being
watched
by
the
party
krafft
had
left
putting
down
the
newspaper
he
wished
his
friend
i
something
to
say
to
you
said
krafft
without
responding
and
having
drained
his
glass
he
clapped
the
lid
to
attract
the
attention
with
the
readiness
to
oblige
which
was
becoming
one
of
his
most
marked
traits
and
in
reality
cloaked
a
deathly
indifference
maurice
hung
up
his
paper
and
sat
forward
to
listen
crossing
his
arms
on
the
table
krafft
began
to
speak
meanwhile
fixing
his
companion
with
his
eye
maurice
was
at
first
too
bewildered
by
what
he
heard
to
know
to
whom
the
words
referred
then
the
colour
mounted
to
his
face
the
nerves
in
his
temples
began
to
throb
and
his
hand
moved
along
the
edge
of
the
table
in
search
of
something
to
which
it
could
hold
it
was
the
first
time
the
name
of
louise
had
been
mentioned
between
them
and
in
what
a
tone
heinz
he
said
at
last
his
voice
seemed
not
to
be
his
own
how
dare
you
speak
of
miss
dufrayer
like
that
pardon
said
krafft
his
flushed
transparent
cheeks
were
aglow
his
limpid
eyes
shone
like
stars
do
you
mean
lulu
maurice
grew
pale
mind
what
you
saying
krafft
took
a
gulp
of
beer
are
you
afraid
of
the
truth
but
just
one
word
and
i
done
you
no
doubt
knew
as
every
one
else
did
that
lulu
was
schilsky
mistress
what
you
did
know
was
this
and
now
without
the
least
attempt
at
palliation
without
a
single
extenuating
word
there
fell
from
his
lips
the
quick
and
witty
narration
of
an
episode
in
which
louise
and
he
had
played
the
chief
parts
it
was
the
keynote
of
their
relations
to
each
other
the
story
grossly
told
of
a
woman
unsatisfied
fancy
before
the
pitiless
details
not
one
of
which
was
spared
him
were
checked
off
maurice
understood
half
rising
from
his
chair
he
struck
krafft
a
resounding
blow
in
the
face
he
had
intended
to
hit
the
mouth
but
his
hand
remaining
fully
open
caught
on
the
cheek
and
with
such
force
that
the
delicate
skin
instantly
bore
a
white
imprint
of
all
five
fingers
only
the
people
in
their
immediate
neighbourhood
saw
what
had
happened
but
these
sprang
up
a
girl
gave
a
nervous
cry
and
in
a
minute
the
further
occupants
of
the
room
had
gathered
round
them
the
with
their
cues
in
their
hands
two
waiters
napkin
on
arm
hastened
up
and
the
proprietor
came
out
from
an
inner
room
and
rubbed
his
hands
meine
herren
meine
herren
krafft
had
jumped
to
his
feet
he
was
also
unable
to
refrain
from
putting
his
hand
to
his
tingling
face
maurice
who
was
very
pale
stood
staring
like
a
person
in
a
trance
at
the
mark
now
deep
red
which
his
hand
had
left
on
his
friend
cheek
there
was
a
solemn
pause
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
krafft
and
the
stillness
was
only
broken
by
the
proprietor
persuasive
meine
herren
meine
herren
in
half
a
minute
krafft
had
collected
himself
turning
he
jauntily
waved
his
hand
to
those
pressing
up
behind
though
one
side
of
his
face
still
blazed
and
burned
do
allow
yourselves
to
be
disturbed
gentlemen
the
incident
is
closed
for
the
present
at
least
my
friend
here
was
carried
away
by
a
momentary
excitement
kindly
resume
your
seats
and
act
as
if
nothing
had
happened
i
shall
call
him
to
account
at
my
own
but
just
one
moment
please
the
last
words
were
addressed
to
maurice
opening
a
notebook
krafft
tore
out
one
of
the
little
pages
and
with
his
customary
indolence
of
movement
wrote
something
on
it
then
he
folded
it
through
the
middle
and
across
again
and
gave
it
to
maurice
maurice
took
it
because
there
seemed
nothing
else
for
him
to
do
he
also
for
the
same
reason
took
his
coat
and
hat
which
some
one
handed
to
him
he
saw
nothing
of
what
went
on
nothing
but
the
five
outspread
marks
which
had
run
together
so
slowly
he
had
however
enough
presence
of
mind
to
do
what
was
evidently
expected
of
him
and
in
the
hush
that
still
prevailed
he
left
the
cafe
the
wind
sent
a
blast
in
his
face
round
the
corners
of
the
streets
which
it
was
briskly
scavenging
it
swept
in
boisterous
gusts
which
beat
the
flat
as
soon
as
they
reared
themselves
and
made
them
give
a
wavering
uncertain
light
not
a
soul
was
visible
but
in
the
moment
that
he
stood
hesitating
outside
the
brilliancy
of
the
yellow
blinds
the
hubbub
of
voices
burst
forth
again
he
moved
hastily
away
and
began
to
walk
to
put
distance
between
himself
and
the
place
he
did
not
shrink
before
the
meadows
but
fought
his
way
forward
till
he
reached
the
woods
there
he
threw
himself
face
downwards
on
the
first
bench
he
came
to
a
smell
of
rotting
and
decay
met
his
nostrils
as
if
from
the
thousands
of
leaves
mouldering
under
the
trees
on
which
they
had
once
hung
some
invisible
hand
had
set
free
thousands
of
odours
there
mounted
to
him
as
he
lay
all
that
rich
and
humid
earthiness
that
belongs
to
sunless
places
and
for
a
time
he
was
conscious
of
little
else
but
this
morbid
fragrance
an
open
brawl
he
had
struck
a
man
in
the
face
before
a
crowd
of
onlookers
and
had
as
good
as
been
ejected
from
their
midst
from
now
on
he
was
an
outcast
from
orderly
society
was
branded
as
one
who
was
not
wholly
responsible
for
his
actions
he
maurice
guest
who
had
ever
been
so
chary
of
committing
himself
what
made
the
matter
seem
still
blacker
too
in
his
own
eyes
was
the
fact
of
krafft
having
once
been
his
intimate
personal
friend
now
he
could
never
even
think
of
him
again
without
at
the
same
time
seeing
the
mark
of
his
hand
on
krafft
cheek
if
the
blow
had
remained
invisible
it
might
have
been
more
easily
forgotten
but
he
had
seen
it
as
it
were
taken
shape
before
or
had
it
only
been
returned
it
would
have
helped
to
lessen
the
weight
of
his
present
abasement
oh
he
would
have
given
all
he
had
to
have
felt
a
return
blow
on
his
own
face
even
the
smallest
loss
of
selfcontrol
on
the
part
of
krafft
would
have
been
enough
but
the
latter
was
too
proud
to
give
himself
away
gratuitously
he
preferred
to
take
his
revenge
in
the
more
unconventional
fashion
of
leaving
his
friend
to
bear
the
ignominy
alone
maurice
lay
stabbing
himself
with
these
and
similar
thoughts
only
little
by
little
did
the
tumult
that
had
been
roused
in
him
abate
then
and
just
the
more
vividly
for
the
break
in
his
memory
the
gross
words
krafft
had
said
came
back
to
him
recalling
them
he
felt
an
intense
bitterness
against
louise
she
was
the
cause
of
all
his
sufferings
were
it
not
for
her
he
might
still
be
leading
a
quiet
decent
life
it
was
her
doing
that
he
was
compelled
to
part
bit
by
bit
with
his
selfrespect
not
once
in
all
the
months
they
had
been
together
had
the
smallest
good
come
to
him
through
her
nothing
but
misery
now
he
had
no
further
rest
where
he
was
he
must
go
to
her
and
tax
her
with
it
repeat
what
krafft
had
said
to
her
very
face
she
should
suffer
too
and
the
foretasted
anguish
and
pleasure
of
hot
recriminations
dulled
all
other
feelings
in
him
he
rose
chilled
to
the
bone
from
his
exposure
one
hand
which
had
hung
down
over
the
bench
was
wet
and
sticky
from
grasping
handfuls
of
dead
leaves
it
was
past
eleven
louise
wakened
with
a
start
and
at
the
sight
of
his
muddy
dishevelled
dress
rose
to
her
elbow
what
is
it
what
the
matter
where
have
you
been
he
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
looked
at
her
the
loose
masses
of
her
hair
which
had
come
unplaited
arrested
his
attention
he
had
never
seemed
to
know
before
how
brutally
black
it
was
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
it
he
repeated
what
krafft
had
told
him
louise
lay
with
the
back
of
one
hand
on
her
forehead
and
watched
him
from
under
it
when
he
had
finished
she
said
so
heinz
has
raked
up
that
old
story
again
has
he
maurice
had
expected
yes
what
had
he
expected
anger
perhaps
or
denial
or
it
might
be
vituperation
only
not
the
almost
impartial
composure
with
which
she
listened
to
him
for
he
had
not
spared
her
a
word
is
that
all
you
got
to
say
he
cried
suffocated
with
doubt
then
you
you
admit
it
admit
it
maurice
are
you
crazy
to
wake
me
up
for
this
it
happened
years
ago
his
recoil
of
disgust
was
too
marked
to
be
ignored
louise
half
sat
up
in
bed
again
supporting
herself
on
one
hand
her
nightgown
was
not
buttoned
he
saw
to
the
waist
a
strip
of
the
white
skin
beneath
saw
too
how
a
long
black
strand
of
her
hair
fell
in
and
lay
on
it
you
wo
tell
me
you
did
know
from
the
first
there
had
been
something
between
heinz
and
me
she
cried
roused
to
defend
and
look
here
maurice
as
he
told
you
that
it
my
turn
now
i
tell
you
why
and
sitting
still
more
upright
she
gave
a
reason
which
made
him
grasp
the
knob
of
the
so
fiercely
that
it
came
away
in
his
hand
he
threw
it
into
a
corner
louise
you
to
take
such
words
on
your
tongue
is
there
no
shame
left
in
you
his
throat
was
dry
and
narrow
shame
you
only
mean
the
need
for
concealment
before
you
had
got
me
there
was
no
talk
of
shame
do
you
know
what
you
saying
oh
that
your
eternal
cry
and
suddenly
spurred
to
anger
she
rose
again
i
know
yes
i
know
do
you
think
i
a
fool
why
must
you
alone
be
so
innocent
why
should
you
alone
not
know
that
i
was
only
jealous
of
a
single
person
and
that
was
krafft
maurice
turned
away
in
the
comparative
darkness
behind
the
screen
he
sat
down
on
the
sofa
put
his
arms
on
the
table
and
his
head
on
his
arms
he
was
exhausted
and
found
he
must
have
slept
as
he
sat
for
when
he
lifted
his
head
again
the
hands
of
the
clock
had
moved
forward
by
several
hours
x
one
morning
towards
the
end
of
january
krafft
disappeared
from
leipzig
and
some
days
later
the
body
of
avery
hill
was
found
in
a
secluded
reach
of
the
pleisse
just
below
connewitz
some
workmen
tramping
townwards
soon
after
dawn
noticed
a
strip
of
light
stuff
twisted
round
a
snag
which
projected
slightly
above
the
surface
of
the
water
it
proved
to
be
the
skirt
of
her
dress
which
had
been
caught
and
held
fast
ambulance
and
police
were
summoned
and
the
body
was
recovered
and
taken
to
the
the
last
of
his
friends
to
see
krafft
was
madeleine
and
the
number
of
those
interested
in
his
departure
and
in
avery
quick
suicide
was
so
large
that
she
several
times
had
to
repeat
her
lively
account
of
the
last
visit
he
paid
her
he
had
come
in
one
afternoon
and
settling
himself
on
the
sofa
refused
to
be
dislodged
as
he
was
in
one
of
his
most
ambiguous
moods
she
left
him
to
himself
and
went
on
with
her
work
on
rising
to
go
he
had
stood
for
a
moment
with
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
well
mada
whatever
happens
remember
i
was
sorry
you
would
have
me
oh
come
now
heinz
you
never
really
asked
me
it
was
snowing
hard
that
night
a
moist
soft
snow
that
melted
as
it
touched
the
ground
and
krafft
borrowed
her
umbrella
as
usual
however
he
returned
before
he
could
have
got
down
the
stairs
to
say
that
he
had
changed
his
mind
and
would
not
take
it
but
you
get
wet
through
i
do
want
your
umbrella
i
tell
or
have
you
two
no
but
i
not
going
oh
well
leave
it
then
and
may
you
reap
a
frightful
rheumatism
as
he
went
down
for
the
second
time
he
whistled
the
rose
of
sharon
she
listened
to
it
grow
fainter
in
the
distance
and
that
was
the
last
she
or
anyone
had
heard
of
krafft
the
following
morning
his
landlady
found
a
note
on
her
instructing
her
to
keep
his
belongings
for
four
weeks
if
by
that
time
they
had
not
been
claimed
she
might
sell
them
and
take
the
money
obtained
for
herself
only
a
few
personal
articles
were
missing
such
as
would
be
necessary
for
a
hurried
of
course
so
madeleine
wound
up
the
story
she
had
never
expected
heinz
to
behave
like
a
normal
mortal
and
to
take
leave
of
his
friends
in
the
ordinary
way
and
she
was
also
grateful
to
him
for
not
pilfering
her
umbrella
which
was
silvertopped
all
the
same
there
was
something
indecent
about
his
behaviour
it
showed
how
little
he
had
at
heart
cared
for
any
of
them
only
a
person
who
thoroughly
despised
others
would
treat
them
in
this
way
playing
with
them
up
to
the
last
minute
as
one
plays
with
dolls
or
fools
avery
hill
was
laid
out
in
a
small
room
adjoining
the
policestation
it
was
evening
before
the
business
of
identification
was
over
various
members
of
the
american
colony
had
to
give
evidence
and
the
services
of
the
consul
were
called
into
play
for
there
were
countless
difficulties
formalities
and
ceremonies
attached
to
this
death
by
one
own
hand
in
a
foreign
country
before
all
the
technical
details
were
concluded
there
were
those
who
thought
and
openly
said
so
that
an
intending
suicide
might
cast
a
merciful
thought
on
the
survivors
only
dove
made
no
complaint
he
had
been
one
of
the
first
to
learn
what
had
happened
and
in
the
days
that
followed
he
ran
to
and
fro
from
one
bureau
to
another
receiving
signatures
and
witnessing
them
bearing
the
whole
brunt
of
surly
saxon
officialdom
on
his
own
shoulders
hours
later
it
had
been
arranged
that
the
body
should
be
buried
on
the
johannisfriedhof
and
the
consul
was
advised
by
cablegram
to
lay
out
the
money
for
the
funeral
under
the
eyes
of
a
and
a
young
clerk
from
the
consul
office
madeleine
assisted
by
miss
jensen
went
through
the
dead
girl
belongings
and
packed
them
together
miss
jensen
kept
up
in
a
low
voice
a
running
commentary
on
the
falsity
of
men
and
the
foolishness
of
women
but
at
times
her
natural
kindness
of
heart
asserted
itself
to
the
confusion
of
her
theories
poor
thing
poor
young
thing
she
murmured
gazing
at
a
pair
of
boots
which
she
held
in
her
hand
if
only
she
had
come
to
us
and
let
us
help
her
help
her
echoed
madeleine
in
a
testy
way
she
was
one
of
those
who
thought
that
the
dead
girl
might
have
shown
more
consideration
for
her
friends
standing
as
they
did
immediately
before
their
prufungen
could
one
help
her
ever
having
set
eyes
on
that
attractive
scoundrel
and
besides
it
easy
enough
thinking
afterwards
one
might
have
been
able
to
help
to
do
this
and
that
it
a
mistake
people
do
want
help
and
they
do
give
you
a
for
offering
it
all
they
ask
is
to
be
let
alone
to
muddle
and
bungle
their
lives
as
they
like
as
they
walked
home
together
miss
jensen
returned
once
more
to
the
subject
of
krafft
failings
i
known
many
men
she
said
one
more
credulously
vain
and
stupid
than
another
for
unless
a
man
is
engaged
in
satisfying
his
brute
instincts
he
can
be
twisted
round
the
finger
of
any
woman
but
krafft
was
the
only
one
i
met
who
did
appear
to
me
to
have
a
single
good
impulse
the
big
woman
voice
grated
on
madeleine
you
quite
wrong
there
she
said
more
snappily
than
before
heinz
had
as
many
good
impulses
as
anyone
else
but
he
had
reduced
the
concealing
of
them
to
a
fine
art
he
was
never
happier
than
when
he
had
succeeded
in
giving
a
totally
false
impression
of
himself
take
me
for
this
for
that
just
what
i
choose
often
it
was
as
if
he
flung
a
bone
to
a
dog
there
that
good
enough
for
you
no
one
knew
heinz
each
of
us
knew
a
little
bit
of
him
and
thought
it
was
all
there
was
to
he
never
showed
a
good
impulse
that
is
as
much
as
saying
that
he
swarmed
with
them
and
no
doubt
he
would
have
considered
that
with
regard
to
you
he
had
been
entirely
successful
you
have
the
idea
of
him
he
meant
you
to
have
he
was
never
her
lover
said
louise
with
a
studied
carelessness
maurice
to
whom
nothing
was
more
offensive
than
the
tone
of
bravado
in
which
she
flaunted
subjects
of
this
nature
was
stung
to
retaliation
how
do
you
know
well
if
you
wish
to
hear
from
his
own
lips
do
you
mean
to
say
you
spoken
to
heinz
about
things
of
that
kind
discussed
his
relations
with
other
women
do
you
need
reminding
that
i
knew
heinz
before
i
had
ever
heard
of
you
he
turned
away
too
dispirited
to
cross
words
with
her
the
events
of
the
past
week
had
closed
over
his
head
as
two
waves
close
over
a
swimmer
cutting
off
light
and
air
since
the
night
on
which
he
had
left
his
whilom
friend
the
mark
of
his
spread
fingers
as
a
parting
gift
he
had
ceased
to
care
greatly
about
anything
compared
with
his
pessimistic
absorption
in
himself
avery
suicide
and
krafft
departure
touched
him
lightly
for
the
girl
he
had
never
cared
as
soon
though
as
he
heard
that
krafft
had
disappeared
he
turned
out
his
pockets
for
the
scrap
of
paper
heinz
had
given
him
that
evening
in
the
cafe
but
it
threw
no
light
on
what
had
happened
it
was
merely
an
address
and
twist
it
as
he
would
maurice
could
make
no
more
of
it
than
the
words
klostergasse
he
resolved
to
go
through
the
street
of
that
name
in
the
afternoon
but
when
the
time
came
he
forgot
about
it
and
it
was
not
till
next
morning
that
he
carried
out
his
intention
there
was
however
nothing
to
be
learned
number
twelve
was
a
gunsmith
shop
and
at
his
hesitating
inquiry
if
anything
were
known
there
of
a
called
krafft
the
owner
of
the
shop
looked
at
him
as
if
he
were
a
lunatic
and
answered
rudely
was
the
herr
under
the
impression
that
the
shop
was
an
information
bureau
louise
was
dressed
to
go
out
pressed
as
to
her
destination
she
said
that
she
was
going
to
see
the
body
maurice
sought
in
vain
to
dissuade
her
it
a
perverse
thing
to
do
he
cried
you
did
care
a
fig
for
the
girl
when
she
was
alive
but
now
she
ca
forbid
it
you
go
and
stare
at
her
out
of
nothing
but
curiosity
how
do
you
know
whether
i
cared
for
her
or
not
louise
threw
at
him
she
was
tying
on
her
veil
before
the
glass
do
you
think
i
tell
you
everything
and
as
for
your
it
the
same
with
all
i
ever
do
you
have
made
it
your
business
always
to
find
my
wishes
absurd
she
took
up
her
gloves
and
holding
them
together
hit
her
muff
with
them
in
this
case
it
does
concern
you
in
the
least
i
do
ask
you
to
come
i
want
to
go
alone
the
more
shattered
and
unsure
he
grew
the
more
was
she
there
was
an
air
of
bravado
in
all
she
did
at
this
time
as
in
the
matter
of
her
determination
to
go
to
the
and
she
hurt
him
with
reckless
cruelty
whenever
a
chance
offered
her
pale
mouth
seemed
only
to
open
to
say
unkind
things
and
her
eyes
weighed
him
with
an
ironic
contempt
to
his
jarred
ears
her
very
laugh
sounded
less
fine
at
moments
she
began
almost
to
look
ugly
to
him
but
it
was
a
dangerous
ugliness
more
seductive
than
her
beauty
had
ever
been
then
he
knew
that
she
was
not
too
good
for
him
nor
he
for
her
nor
either
of
them
for
the
world
they
lived
in
they
walked
side
by
side
to
the
mortuary
it
was
a
very
cold
day
and
louise
wore
heavy
furs
from
which
her
face
rose
enticingly
the
attention
she
attracted
was
to
maurice
like
gall
to
a
wound
there
was
not
much
difficulty
in
gaining
admittance
to
the
dead
a
small
coin
changed
hands
and
a
man
in
uniform
opened
the
door
the
examination
had
been
held
that
day
and
the
body
was
swathed
from
head
to
foot
in
a
white
sheet
it
lay
on
a
long
projecting
shelf
and
a
ticket
was
pinned
on
the
wall
at
its
head
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
on
a
similar
shelf
was
another
shrouded
figure
the
body
of
a
workingman
found
that
morning
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
with
an
empty
bottle
which
had
contained
carbolic
acid
by
its
side
the
leichenfrau
the
public
layer
out
of
the
dead
told
them
this
it
was
she
too
who
drew
back
the
sheet
from
avery
face
in
order
that
they
might
see
it
she
was
a
rosy
woman
and
her
vivid
colouring
was
thrown
into
relief
by
the
long
black
cloak
and
the
black
that
she
wore
maurice
for
whom
the
dead
as
such
had
no
attraction
turned
from
his
contemplation
of
the
figure
on
the
shelf
to
watch
the
living
woman
the
exuberance
of
her
vitality
had
something
almost
insultant
in
the
presence
of
these
two
rigid
forms
from
whose
faces
the
colour
had
fled
for
ever
her
eyes
were
alert
like
those
of
a
bird
her
voice
and
movements
were
loud
and
bustling
in
thought
he
compared
her
to
a
it
was
this
woman
calling
to
live
on
the
dead
she
hastened
from
house
to
house
to
cleanse
poor
inanimate
bodies
whose
dignity
had
departed
from
them
he
wondered
idly
whether
she
gloated
over
the
announcements
of
fresh
deaths
and
mentally
sped
the
dying
did
she
talk
of
good
seasons
and
of
slack
seasons
and
look
forward
to
the
spread
of
contagious
disease
well
at
least
she
throve
on
her
trade
as
a
butcher
thrives
by
continually
handling
meat
louise
had
eyes
only
for
the
face
of
the
dead
girl
she
stood
gazing
at
it
with
a
curious
absorption
but
without
a
spark
of
feeling
the
leichenfrau
having
finished
tying
up
a
basket
crossed
the
room
and
joined
her
eine
schone
leiche
she
said
and
nodded
appreciating
the
fact
that
a
stranger
should
admire
what
was
partly
her
own
handiwork
it
was
true
avery
face
looked
as
though
it
were
modelled
in
wax
she
had
not
been
in
the
water
for
more
than
half
an
hour
had
said
the
doctor
not
long
enough
to
be
disfigured
in
any
way
only
her
hair
remained
dank
and
matted
and
although
it
was
laid
straight
out
over
the
bolster
it
would
probably
never
be
quite
dry
again
no
matter
continued
the
woman
on
the
morrow
would
come
the
barber
a
good
friend
of
hers
to
dress
it
for
the
tomb
he
would
bring
tongs
and
irons
and
other
with
him
and
for
certain
would
make
a
good
job
of
it
so
skilled
was
he
he
had
all
the
latest
fashions
in
at
his
the
face
itself
was
as
placid
as
it
had
been
in
life
the
lids
were
firmly
closed
no
peeping
or
squinting
here
and
the
lips
met
and
rested
on
each
other
round
and
full
seen
like
this
it
now
became
evident
that
his
face
was
one
of
those
which
are
all
along
intended
for
death
intended
that
is
to
lie
waxen
and
immobile
to
show
to
best
advantage
in
life
there
had
been
too
marked
a
discrepancy
between
the
extreme
warmth
of
the
girl
colouring
and
the
extreme
immobility
of
her
expression
now
that
the
blood
had
as
it
were
been
drained
away
to
the
last
drop
now
that
temples
and
nostrils
had
attained
transparency
the
fine
texture
of
the
skin
and
the
beauty
of
the
curves
of
lips
and
chin
were
visible
to
every
eye
only
one
hand
so
the
leichenfrau
babbled
on
was
convulsively
closed
and
could
not
be
undone
and
as
she
spoke
she
drew
the
sheet
further
down
and
displayed
the
naked
arm
and
hand
the
long
fine
fingers
were
clenched
the
thumb
inside
the
rest
otherwise
avery
appeared
to
sleep
to
sleep
profoundly
with
an
intensity
such
as
living
sleep
never
attains
to
the
very
epitome
of
repose
it
seemed
as
if
her
eyelids
were
pressed
down
by
some
unseen
force
and
in
her
presence
the
feeling
gained
ground
in
one
that
it
was
worth
enduring
much
to
arrive
at
a
rest
of
this
kind
at
last
ja
ja
said
the
woman
and
rearranged
the
covering
it
a
pleasure
to
handle
such
a
pretty
corpse
that
one
there
now
with
her
chin
she
pointed
to
the
other
figure
and
made
a
face
of
disgust
ein
ekliger
kerl
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
with
him
let
me
see
what
he
like
begged
louise
it
an
ugly
sight
said
the
woman
however
she
pulled
the
sheet
down
and
so
far
that
not
only
the
face
but
also
a
part
of
the
hairy
black
breast
was
visible
louise
shuddered
yet
the
very
horror
of
the
thing
fascinated
her
and
she
plied
the
woman
with
questions
about
the
workings
of
the
agonising
poison
that
had
been
swallowed
after
one
hasty
glance
maurice
had
turned
away
and
now
stood
staring
out
of
the
high
barred
window
into
a
gloomy
little
courtyard
for
him
the
air
of
the
room
was
hard
to
breathe
owing
to
the
faint
yet
unmistakable
odour
which
even
the
waxen
figure
of
the
girl
had
begun
to
exhale
and
he
marvelled
how
louise
who
was
so
sensitive
could
endure
it
outside
both
drew
long
breaths
of
the
cold
evening
air
and
louise
bought
a
bunch
of
violets
which
she
pressed
to
nose
and
mouth
horrible
horrible
she
said
at
the
same
time
raising
her
shoulders
in
their
heavy
cape
oh
that
man
i
shall
never
forget
his
face
what
do
you
go
to
such
places
for
you
have
only
yourself
to
thank
for
it
he
too
was
aware
that
a
needless
and
repellent
memory
had
been
added
to
their
lives
oh
everything
my
own
fault
i
know
that
you
are
never
to
blame
for
anything
did
i
ask
you
to
go
there
did
i
but
she
only
laughed
in
reply
through
and
through
hostile
to
him
and
they
walked
for
some
distance
in
silence
why
are
you
going
this
way
he
asked
suspiciously
when
she
turned
into
a
street
that
led
in
the
opposite
direction
to
that
which
they
should
have
taken
i
not
going
home
i
could
sit
alone
in
the
dark
with
that
that
thing
before
my
eyes
who
asked
you
to
sit
alone
where
are
you
going
i
do
know
where
i
like
that
no
answer
and
if
i
do
choose
to
answer
i
do
want
you
i
want
to
be
alone
i
sick
of
your
perpetual
and
your
eternal
he
laughed
just
as
she
had
done
the
sound
enraged
her
oh
the
dead
at
least
are
at
peace
she
cried
yes
why
do
you
say
it
you
wish
you
were
lying
there
at
peace
from
me
why
should
i
say
what
you
know
so
well
go
and
do
it
then
who
hindering
you
for
you
kill
myself
for
you
one
word
gave
another
they
pressed
forward
in
the
falling
dusk
like
two
distraught
creatures
heedless
of
the
notice
they
attracted
or
of
who
should
hear
their
bitter
words
and
because
their
gestures
were
to
some
extent
regulated
by
the
conventions
of
the
street
because
they
could
not
face
each
other
with
flaming
eyes
and
throw
out
hands
and
arms
to
emphasise
what
they
said
their
words
were
all
the
more
cruel
louise
made
straight
for
home
now
she
escaped
into
the
house
banging
the
door
maurice
strode
down
the
street
in
a
tumult
of
resentment
vowing
never
to
return
avery
hill
was
buried
the
following
afternoon
maurice
went
to
the
funeral
because
since
he
had
seen
the
dead
girl
body
at
the
mortuary
he
had
been
invaded
by
a
kind
of
pity
for
her
lying
alone
at
the
mercy
of
barber
and
leichenfrau
and
so
towards
three
he
fought
his
way
against
a
cutting
wind
to
the
johannisfriedhof
a
mere
handful
of
people
stood
round
the
grave
in
addition
to
the
english
chaplain
and
a
couple
of
diggers
there
were
present
dove
two
americans
and
a
young
clerk
from
the
consul
office
who
was
happy
to
be
associated
in
any
fashion
with
the
english
residents
it
was
the
coldest
day
of
that
winter
over
the
earth
swept
a
harsh
dry
wind
which
cut
like
the
blade
of
a
knife
and
forced
stinging
tears
from
the
eyes
this
wind
had
dried
the
frozen
surface
of
the
ground
to
the
impenetrability
of
iron
loose
earth
crumbled
before
it
like
powder
grass
and
shrubs
had
shrivelled
blighted
by
its
breath
the
bare
trees
were
against
the
sky
so
intense
was
the
prevailing
sensation
of
icy
dryness
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
earth
would
never
again
know
moisture
people
faces
grew
as
wizened
as
the
skins
of
old
apples
throats
and
lungs
were
choked
by
the
grey
dust
which
whirled
through
the
streets
and
made
breathing
an
effort
in
the
outlying
cemetery
it
was
still
bleaker
than
in
the
shelter
of
the
houses
over
this
stretch
of
ground
the
wind
swept
as
over
the
surface
of
a
sea
the
related
the
extraordinary
difficulty
they
had
had
in
digging
the
grave
the
earth
that
had
been
thrown
up
lay
cracked
into
huge
frozen
lumps
these
two
men
stood
in
the
background
while
the
service
was
going
on
and
stamped
their
feet
and
beat
their
hands
encased
in
monstrous
woollen
gloves
to
keep
the
blood
flowing
the
english
chaplain
a
tall
cadaverous
man
with
sunken
cheeks
and
a
beard
had
wound
a
red
and
white
comforter
over
his
surplice
the
five
young
men
pulled
down
the
of
their
caps
and
stood
with
shoulders
burrowing
their
hands
in
their
pockets
the
chaplain
gabbled
the
few
necessary
prayers
they
were
inaudible
to
his
hearers
for
the
rushing
wind
carried
them
straight
over
his
shoulder
into
space
he
was
not
more
than
a
bare
ten
minutes
over
the
service
then
the
diggers
came
forward
to
lower
the
coffin
owing
to
the
stiffness
of
their
hands
the
ropes
slid
from
their
grasp
and
the
coffin
fell
forward
into
the
hard
yellow
grave
with
a
bump
the
young
men
took
the
obligatory
handfuls
of
earth
and
struck
the
side
of
the
coffin
with
them
as
gently
as
possible
with
the
last
word
still
on
his
lips
the
chaplain
shut
his
book
and
fled
and
the
rest
hastily
dispersed
maurice
shook
off
the
young
clerk
who
was
murmuring
unintelligible
words
of
sympathy
and
left
the
cemetery
in
the
wake
of
the
two
americans
for
whom
a
droschke
was
in
waiting
to
take
them
back
to
the
town
waal
i
sort
o
relieved
that
was
my
funeral
he
heard
one
of
them
say
he
walked
at
full
speed
to
restore
his
famished
circulation
when
he
was
in
the
heart
of
the
town
again
he
entered
a
cafe
and
there
he
remained
with
his
elbows
on
the
little
marble
table
letting
the
scene
he
had
just
come
through
pass
once
more
before
his
mind
there
had
been
something
grotesquely
indecent
about
the
haste
of
every
one
concerned
the
chaplain
gabbling
like
a
parrot
out
of
regard
for
the
safety
of
his
own
lungs
the
of
the
diggers
whose
thoughts
were
no
doubt
running
on
the
size
of
their
gratuities
the
openly
expressed
satisfaction
of
the
few
mourners
when
they
were
free
to
hurry
off
again
as
in
hurry
they
had
arrived
not
one
present
but
had
counted
the
minutes
at
the
expiry
of
which
the
dead
girl
would
be
consigned
to
her
appointed
hole
what
an
ending
all
the
talent
the
incipient
genius
that
had
been
in
her
thrust
away
with
the
greatest
possible
despatch
buried
out
of
sight
in
the
hideously
hard
cold
earth
snuffed
out
like
a
candle
and
with
as
little
ceremony
was
all
the
warm
complex
life
that
had
made
up
this
one
throbbing
bit
of
humanity
for
what
it
had
been
not
a
soul
alive
now
cared
and
what
a
night
too
for
one
first
night
underground
brr
at
the
thought
of
it
he
drank
another
cup
of
coffee
and
a
fiery
stirring
liqueur
but
the
sense
of
depression
clung
to
him
and
as
he
walked
home
he
regretted
the
impulse
that
had
led
him
to
attend
the
funeral
for
all
the
melancholy
of
valediction
was
his
the
dead
girl
was
free
and
he
had
a
sudden
vision
of
her
as
she
had
lain
in
the
mortuary
with
the
look
of
superhuman
peace
on
her
face
over
the
head
of
this
he
was
sarcastic
at
his
own
expense
for
though
she
were
being
treated
like
a
piece
of
lumber
what
did
it
matter
to
her
beneath
the
screening
lid
she
continued
to
sleep
tranquil
undisturbed
on
the
other
hand
how
absurd
it
was
that
he
who
had
cared
little
for
her
in
life
should
in
this
wise
constitute
himself
her
only
mourner
and
mentally
and
physically
he
now
jerked
himself
to
rights
and
even
began
to
whistle
as
he
went
in
an
attempt
to
seem
at
harmony
with
himself
but
the
tune
that
rose
to
his
lips
was
krafft
song
the
rose
of
sharon
and
he
straightway
broke
off
in
disgust
and
confusion
in
his
room
as
soon
as
he
had
struck
a
match
to
light
the
lamp
he
saw
that
a
letter
was
lying
on
the
table
by
the
gradual
spread
of
the
light
he
made
out
that
it
bore
an
austrian
stamp
and
directly
he
took
it
in
his
hand
he
recognised
the
writing
heinz
it
was
from
heinz
he
tore
open
the
envelope
with
unsteady
fingers
what
could
heinz
have
to
write
to
him
about
instinctively
he
connected
it
in
some
way
with
the
events
of
the
afternoon
but
it
was
a
very
brief
note
covering
hardly
a
page
of
the
paper
standing
beside
the
lamp
maurice
held
the
sheet
in
the
circle
of
light
and
ran
his
eye
over
the
few
lines
he
took
them
in
in
a
flash
that
is
to
say
he
read
them
automatically
but
their
sense
did
not
penetrate
his
brain
he
tried
again
and
still
he
could
not
grasp
what
they
meant
still
again
and
slowly
word
by
word
till
he
could
have
repeated
them
by
heart
but
always
without
getting
at
their
inner
meaning
then
however
and
all
of
a
sudden
as
if
some
inner
consciousness
had
understood
them
and
now
gave
bodily
warning
of
it
suddenly
his
knees
began
to
shake
and
he
was
forced
to
sit
down
sitting
he
continued
to
stare
at
the
page
of
writing
before
him
with
contracted
pupils
he
commenced
to
read
again
and
even
said
the
first
line
or
two
of
the
letter
aloud
as
if
that
might
aid
him
but
the
paper
fell
from
his
hand
and
he
gazed
instead
into
the
flame
of
the
lamp
right
into
the
inmost
flame
till
he
was
blind
with
it
his
head
fell
forward
and
lay
on
his
hands
and
on
the
rustling
sheet
of
paper
god
in
heaven
he
heard
himself
say
it
and
was
even
conscious
of
the
fact
that
like
every
mortal
in
the
throes
of
a
strong
emotion
he
too
called
on
god
a
long
and
profound
silence
ensued
it
went
on
and
on
persisted
was
about
to
become
eternal
when
it
was
rudely
broken
by
the
sound
of
a
child
cry
he
raised
his
head
the
walls
swam
round
him
in
spite
of
the
coldness
of
the
night
and
the
fact
that
the
room
was
unheated
he
was
clammy
with
perspiration
the
skin
of
his
face
too
had
a
peculiar
drawn
feeling
as
if
it
were
a
mask
that
was
too
tight
for
it
he
shivered
then
his
eye
fell
on
the
letter
lying
open
on
the
table
without
a
moment
hesitation
without
waiting
even
to
put
the
lamp
out
he
seized
it
and
went
headlong
from
the
house
but
he
was
strangely
unequal
to
exertion
he
felt
a
craving
for
stimulant
and
entering
a
drank
a
couple
of
cognacs
his
strength
came
back
to
him
people
moved
out
of
his
way
he
had
energy
enough
to
climb
the
stair
and
to
go
through
the
business
of
unlocking
the
door
at
his
abrupt
entrance
louise
concealed
something
in
a
drawer
and
turned
the
key
on
it
but
maurice
was
too
to
heed
her
action
or
consciously
to
hear
her
exclamation
at
his
haggard
appearance
he
shut
the
door
crossed
to
where
she
was
standing
and
without
speaking
pulled
her
nearer
to
the
lamp
by
its
light
he
scanned
her
face
with
a
desperate
eagerness
what
is
it
what
the
matter
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
the
tension
of
the
past
hour
relaxed
he
let
his
head
fall
on
her
shoulder
and
shut
his
eyes
swaying
as
she
swayed
beneath
his
weight
forgive
me
forgive
me
you
been
drinking
i
think
but
she
held
still
under
his
grasp
yes
i
have
louise
tell
me
it
a
horrible
mistake
help
me
you
must
help
me
how
can
i
help
you
if
you
wo
tell
me
what
the
matter
is
she
believed
him
to
be
half
drunk
and
spoke
as
to
a
drunken
person
without
meaning
much
yes
yes
i
will
only
give
me
time
but
he
postponed
beginning
leaning
more
heavily
on
her
he
pressed
his
lips
to
the
stuff
of
her
dress
he
would
have
liked
to
sleep
just
where
he
was
indeed
he
was
invaded
by
the
desire
to
sleep
never
again
to
unclose
his
eyes
but
she
grew
restless
and
tried
to
draw
her
shoulder
away
then
he
looked
at
her
and
a
feverish
stream
of
words
half
half
in
burst
from
his
lips
but
they
had
little
to
do
with
the
matter
in
hand
and
were
incomprehensible
to
her
it
has
been
a
terrible
nightmare
and
only
you
can
drive
it
away
as
he
spoke
he
looked
with
a
sudden
suspicion
right
into
her
eyes
but
they
neither
faltered
nor
grew
uneasy
it
will
turn
out
to
be
nothing
i
know
she
said
coldly
always
devising
some
new
way
of
tormenting
me
her
words
roused
him
fumbling
in
his
pocket
he
drew
from
it
letter
is
that
nothing
read
it
and
tell
me
i
found
it
at
home
on
my
table
louise
took
it
with
unmoved
indifference
but
directly
she
saw
whose
handwriting
it
was
her
face
grew
grave
and
attentive
she
looked
back
from
the
envelope
to
him
to
see
what
he
was
thinking
to
learn
how
much
he
knew
in
spite
of
his
roughness
there
was
a
hungry
imploring
look
in
his
eyes
an
appeal
to
her
to
put
him
out
of
misery
and
in
the
way
he
desired
and
as
always
before
such
a
look
her
own
face
hardened
read
it
what
he
dares
to
write
to
me
slowly
as
if
it
were
impossible
for
her
to
hurry
she
drew
the
sheet
from
the
crumpled
envelope
and
smoothed
it
out
as
she
did
so
she
half
turned
away
but
not
so
far
that
he
could
not
see
the
dark
disfiguring
blood
stain
her
neck
and
blotch
her
cheek
even
her
ear
grew
crimson
she
read
deliberately
lingering
over
each
word
but
the
instant
she
had
finished
she
crushed
the
paper
to
a
ball
and
threw
it
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
the
scoundrel
she
cried
oh
the
scoundrel
clenching
her
two
hands
she
pressed
them
to
her
face
maurice
did
not
say
a
word
he
hardly
dared
to
draw
breath
for
fear
some
sign
of
her
guilt
might
escape
him
leaning
against
the
table
he
marked
each
quiver
of
lip
or
eyelid
the
blackguard
she
cried
again
shaken
by
rage
if
i
had
him
here
i
strangle
him
with
my
own
hands
he
gloated
over
her
anger
yes
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
too
could
kill
him
there
was
a
pause
in
which
each
followed
out
a
possible
means
of
revenge
now
you
see
he
said
when
i
got
home
when
i
found
that
i
thought
i
should
go
mad
reminded
thus
of
his
share
in
the
matter
louise
turned
her
head
and
considered
him
her
face
was
tense
forgive
me
said
maurice
and
held
out
his
hands
to
her
she
gave
him
another
look
of
the
same
kind
i
forgive
you
what
for
because
since
i
got
it
i
been
thinking
vile
things
oh
that
she
moved
away
and
gave
a
curt
laugh
which
met
him
like
a
stab
but
she
had
no
consideration
for
him
she
had
only
room
in
her
mind
for
krafft
treachery
i
could
kill
him
she
said
again
do
leave
me
alone
this
to
maurice
who
was
trying
to
take
her
hand
do
touch
me
not
touch
you
why
not
in
an
instant
his
softness
passed
over
into
suspicion
it
was
like
a
dry
pile
that
had
waited
for
the
match
i
not
touch
you
he
repeated
do
you
want
to
make
me
believe
that
what
he
says
there
is
true
believe
what
you
like
but
that
just
what
i
wo
do
turn
here
look
me
in
the
face
now
tell
me
it
a
lie
she
struggled
to
free
her
hands
you
hurt
me
maurice
let
me
go
be
careful
or
i
shall
hurt
you
more
than
this
now
answer
me
you
with
your
ridiculous
heroics
be
careful
yourself
his
grip
of
her
grew
tighter
for
your
precious
peace
of
mind
then
that
you
may
not
be
kept
in
suspense
what
heinz
says
there
is
true
he
did
not
at
once
grasp
what
she
meant
he
stood
staring
stupidly
at
her
still
clutching
her
hands
with
a
determined
effort
louise
wrenched
them
away
do
you
hear
what
i
say
it
true
all
true
every
word
of
it
at
the
cruel
repetition
he
went
pale
and
after
that
seemed
to
go
on
growing
paler
until
his
face
was
like
a
sheet
of
paper
a
horrible
silence
ensued
neither
dared
to
let
go
of
the
other
eyes
my
god
he
said
at
last
my
god
he
sat
down
at
the
table
and
buried
his
face
in
his
arms
louise
did
not
move
she
stood
waiting
her
hands
which
were
red
and
sore
pressed
against
her
sides
and
as
minutes
passed
and
he
did
not
stir
she
began
in
a
vacant
way
to
count
the
ticks
of
the
clock
if
he
did
not
speak
soon
did
not
go
on
with
what
had
to
come
and
get
it
over
she
would
be
forced
to
scream
a
scream
was
mounting
in
her
throat
when
was
it
how
why
she
made
no
answer
he
straightened
himself
holding
on
to
the
table
and
if
that
letter
had
come
you
would
have
told
me
again
she
did
not
reply
he
sprang
to
his
feet
interpreting
her
inability
to
bring
forth
a
sound
as
mere
contemptuous
defiance
why
did
you
tell
me
did
i
need
to
know
he
cried
loudly
and
in
the
confines
of
the
room
his
voice
had
the
force
of
a
shout
as
she
still
remained
dumb
he
leaned
across
the
table
and
actually
shouted
at
her
any
more
are
there
any
more
he
wo
have
been
the
only
one
tell
me
i
say
good
god
do
you
hear
me
the
arteries
in
his
temples
were
beating
like
two
separate
hearts
as
nothing
he
said
would
make
her
open
her
lips
he
snatched
up
her
hands
again
and
dragged
her
a
few
steps
forward
this
to
prove
to
himself
that
he
had
at
least
bodily
power
over
her
how
dare
you
stand
there
and
say
it
true
you
brazen
shameless
she
thought
he
was
going
to
strike
her
and
moved
her
head
quickly
to
one
side
the
movement
did
not
escape
him
he
was
amazed
at
it
and
horrified
by
it
you
afraid
of
me
are
you
you
expect
to
be
beaten
when
you
make
a
confession
of
that
sort
and
as
she
kept
her
head
bent
in
suspense
he
shouted
very
well
you
shall
have
something
to
be
afraid
of
you
and
lifting
his
hand
he
struck
her
a
blow
on
the
shoulder
it
was
given
with
force
and
she
sank
to
the
floor
where
she
lay
in
a
heap
screening
her
face
with
her
arm
the
first
taste
of
his
greater
strength
was
like
the
flavour
of
blood
to
a
beast
of
prey
in
her
mind
she
might
defy
him
physically
he
was
her
master
and
he
struck
her
again
and
again
but
he
did
not
wring
any
sound
from
her
she
lay
face
downwards
and
let
the
blows
fall
when
his
first
onslaught
of
rage
had
spent
itself
a
glimmering
of
reason
returned
to
him
he
staggered
to
his
feet
and
looked
down
with
horror
at
the
prostrate
figure
my
god
what
am
i
doing
what
have
i
done
a
sudden
fear
swept
through
him
that
he
had
killed
her
but
now
for
the
first
time
she
spoke
it
true
he
heard
her
say
at
these
words
the
desire
actually
to
kill
her
was
so
overwhelming
that
he
moved
precipitately
away
and
in
order
not
to
see
her
pressed
his
smarting
hand
to
his
eyes
but
in
the
greater
clearness
of
thought
this
shutting
off
of
externals
brought
with
it
the
ultimate
meaning
of
what
she
had
done
was
revealed
to
him
he
saw
red
through
his
closed
lids
and
going
back
to
her
he
struck
her
anew
the
knowledge
that
under
her
she
had
nothing
on
but
a
thin
nightgown
gave
him
pleasure
he
felt
each
of
the
blows
fall
full
and
hard
on
her
firm
flesh
from
time
to
time
she
turned
her
face
to
cry
it
true
it
is
true
deliberately
inciting
him
to
continue
but
the
moment
came
when
his
arm
sank
powerless
to
his
side
when
if
his
life
had
depended
on
it
he
could
not
have
struck
another
blow
with
difficulty
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
such
was
the
apathy
that
came
over
him
that
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
drag
himself
to
the
sofa
once
there
he
leaned
back
and
closed
his
eyes
for
half
an
hour
or
more
neither
of
them
stirred
then
when
she
understood
that
he
had
done
that
he
was
not
coming
back
to
her
louise
pulled
herself
into
a
sitting
position
and
from
there
to
her
feet
she
could
hardly
stand
her
head
swam
not
an
inch
of
her
body
but
ached
and
stung
her
exaltation
had
left
her
now
she
began
to
feel
sick
and
going
over
to
the
bed
she
fell
heavily
upon
it
maurice
heard
her
movements
but
so
incapable
did
he
feel
of
further
effort
that
lie
remained
sitting
with
his
eyes
shut
a
new
sound
roused
him
she
was
shivering
and
with
such
violence
that
the
bedstead
was
shaken
after
a
crucial
struggle
with
himself
he
rose
and
crossed
the
room
she
was
lying
outside
the
bedclothes
he
pulled
off
an
quilt
and
spread
it
over
her
as
he
did
this
his
arms
were
round
her
all
the
beloved
body
was
in
his
grasp
when
he
had
finished
he
did
not
remove
them
but
kneeling
down
beside
the
bed
pressed
his
face
to
the
quilt
and
to
the
warm
body
below
and
so
the
night
wore
away
xi
throughout
february
and
the
greater
part
of
march
the
hauptprufungen
were
held
in
the
conservatorium
twice
a
week
from
six
to
eight
in
the
evening
the
concert
hall
was
crammed
with
an
eager
crowd
to
these
concerts
the
outside
public
was
admitted
the
critics
were
invited
and
the
performances
received
notices
in
the
newspapers
in
short
the
outgoing
student
was
for
the
first
time
treated
like
a
real
debutant
concerted
music
was
accompanied
by
the
full
orchestra
the
large
gallery
that
ran
round
the
hall
was
opened
up
and
the
girls
whose
eager
faces
hung
over
its
edge
were
more
brightly
decked
than
usual
in
ribbons
and
laces
some
of
those
who
stepped
down
the
platform
seemed
thoroughly
to
relish
their
first
taste
of
publicity
others
on
the
contrary
were
awkward
and
abashed
and
did
not
venture
to
notice
the
encouragement
that
greeted
their
entrance
there
were
players
as
composed
as
the
most
hardened
virtuosi
others
again
who
were
overcome
by
to
such
an
extent
that
they
barely
escaped
a
total
fiasco
the
success
of
the
year
was
dove
in
his
performance
of
concerto
in
e
minor
dove
unshakable
was
here
of
immense
value
to
him
not
a
note
was
missed
not
a
turn
slurred
the
runs
and
brilliant
of
the
concerto
left
his
fingers
like
showers
of
pearls
his
touch
had
the
necessary
delicacy
and
in
addition
to
this
his
reading
was
quite
a
revelation
to
his
friends
in
the
matter
of
temperament
it
is
true
that
schwarz
prohibited
any
undignified
display
of
the
emotional
side
of
chopin
the
interpretation
had
to
be
on
classical
lines
but
even
the
most
determined
opponents
of
schwarz
method
were
forced
to
acknowledge
that
dove
made
no
mean
show
of
the
poetic
contents
of
the
music
the
master
himself
in
his
imperturbable
way
he
chose
to
act
as
if
all
along
he
had
had
this
surprise
for
people
up
his
sleeve
the
master
was
in
transports
his
stern
face
wore
an
almost
genial
expression
he
smiled
and
talked
loudly
and
when
the
performance
was
over
hurried
to
and
fro
full
of
importance
shaking
hands
and
accepting
congratulations
with
a
fine
shade
of
reserve
dove
were
enraptured
for
sake
for
undeniably
the
master
numbers
this
year
were
poor
compared
with
those
of
other
teachers
it
behoved
the
remainder
to
make
the
most
of
this
isolated
triumph
they
did
so
and
were
entertained
by
schwarz
at
a
special
dinner
where
many
healths
were
drunk
those
who
had
made
their
prufung
as
the
phrase
ran
were
as
a
rule
glad
to
leave
leipzig
when
the
ordeal
was
behind
them
but
dove
who
on
the
day
following
his
performance
when
his
name
was
to
be
read
in
the
newspapers
accompanied
by
various
epithets
of
praise
had
proposed
and
been
accepted
and
was
this
time
returning
to
england
a
solemnly
engaged
man
dove
waited
a
week
for
his
fiancee
and
her
family
who
had
not
been
prepared
for
so
sudden
a
move
he
was
the
man
of
the
hour
as
a
response
to
the
flattering
notices
he
had
called
on
all
his
critics
and
been
received
by
several
and
he
could
hardly
walk
a
without
running
the
gauntlet
of
some
belated
congratulation
schwarz
had
spoken
seriously
to
him
about
prosecuting
his
studies
for
a
further
year
with
the
not
impossible
prospect
of
a
performance
in
the
gewandhaus
at
the
end
of
it
but
dove
had
laid
before
his
master
the
reasons
why
this
could
not
be
he
was
no
longer
a
free
man
there
were
now
other
wishes
to
be
consulted
in
addition
to
his
own
besides
if
the
truth
must
be
told
dove
had
higher
aims
and
these
led
him
imperatively
back
to
england
madeleine
was
ready
to
leave
a
couple
of
days
after
her
last
performance
her
plans
for
the
future
were
fixed
and
sure
she
had
long
ago
given
up
making
adventurous
schemes
for
storming
america
that
had
merely
been
her
contribution
to
the
romance
of
the
place
now
she
was
hastening
away
to
spend
the
month
of
march
in
paris
she
was
not
due
at
the
school
to
which
she
was
returning
till
the
end
of
april
and
in
paris
she
intended
to
take
a
brief
course
of
finishing
lessons
to
rub
off
what
she
called
german
thoroughness
she
too
had
made
a
highly
successful
exit
though
without
creating
a
furore
like
dove
since
all
she
did
was
well
done
it
was
not
possible
for
her
to
be
a
surprise
to
anyone
and
finally
the
rush
she
had
lived
in
for
weeks
past
was
over
the
last
afternoon
had
come
and
in
its
course
she
went
to
the
railway
station
to
make
arrangements
about
her
luggage
on
her
way
home
she
entered
klemm
where
she
stood
for
a
considerable
time
taking
leave
of
one
and
another
when
she
emerged
again
the
town
had
assumed
that
spectral
look
which
towards
evening
made
the
quaint
old
gabled
streets
so
attractive
for
the
first
time
madeleine
felt
something
akin
to
regret
at
having
to
leave
she
had
enjoyed
and
made
the
most
of
her
years
of
study
but
she
was
now
quite
ready
to
advance
curious
to
attack
the
future
and
to
dominate
that
also
still
the
dusk
on
the
familiar
streets
inclined
her
to
feel
sentimental
this
time
tomorrow
i
be
hundreds
of
miles
away
she
said
to
herself
and
probably
shall
never
see
the
old
place
again
as
she
walked
she
looked
back
upon
her
residence
there
already
somewhat
in
the
light
of
a
remembrance
weighing
what
it
had
been
worth
to
her
part
of
it
was
intimately
associated
with
maurice
guest
and
thus
she
recalled
him
too
of
late
he
had
passed
out
of
her
life
she
had
been
too
busy
to
think
of
him
now
however
that
she
was
at
the
end
of
this
period
the
fancy
seized
her
to
see
him
again
and
she
took
a
resolution
which
had
perhaps
been
dormant
in
her
for
some
time
i
do
see
why
i
should
she
reasoned
no
one
will
know
and
even
if
they
do
i
leaving
and
it
wo
matter
and
so
she
pulled
her
hat
further
over
her
face
and
brisked
up
her
steps
in
the
direction
of
the
braustrasse
a
street
which
she
disliked
and
never
entered
if
she
could
avoid
it
if
he
had
lived
in
a
better
neighbourhood
things
might
have
gone
better
with
him
she
mused
for
madeleine
was
a
staunch
believer
in
the
influence
of
surroundings
and
could
not
for
instance
understand
a
person
who
lived
in
dirt
and
disorder
having
any
but
a
dirty
or
disorderly
mind
she
went
from
door
to
door
scanning
the
numbers
with
her
head
poked
a
little
forward
and
to
one
side
like
a
bird
as
she
ascended
the
stair
she
raised
her
skirts
and
her
nostrils
twitched
displeased
frau
krause
held
the
door
open
by
an
inch
and
looked
at
madeleine
with
distrust
no
he
not
she
replied
and
what
more
i
could
say
if
you
were
to
pay
me
when
he
will
be
but
madeleine
was
not
to
be
daunted
by
the
arrogance
of
any
landlady
alive
why
is
he
so
irregular
she
asked
she
had
placed
her
foot
in
the
opening
of
the
door
and
now
by
a
skilful
movement
inserted
herself
bodily
into
the
passage
frau
krause
baffled
could
do
no
more
than
mumble
a
well
if
you
like
to
wait
and
point
out
the
room
she
followed
madeleine
over
the
threshold
drying
her
hands
on
her
apron
are
you
a
friend
of
his
may
i
ask
she
inquired
why
what
do
you
want
to
know
for
do
you
think
i
be
here
if
i
were
said
madeleine
looking
her
up
and
down
why
i
want
to
know
repeated
frau
krause
and
tossed
her
head
why
because
i
think
if
herr
guest
has
any
friends
left
they
ought
to
know
how
he
going
on
that
why
fraulein
how
going
on
queried
madeleine
with
undisturbed
coolness
and
looked
round
her
for
a
chair
throwing
a
cautious
glance
over
her
shoulder
frau
krause
said
behind
her
hand
it
my
opinion
there
a
woman
in
the
case
you
do
need
to
whisper
your
opinion
is
an
open
secret
answered
madeleine
drily
there
is
a
woman
and
there
she
sits
as
you
no
doubt
very
well
know
as
she
spoke
she
pointed
to
a
photograph
of
louise
which
stood
on
the
lid
of
the
piano
i
thought
as
much
exclaimed
the
landlady
i
thought
as
much
and
a
bad
bold
face
it
is
too
now
explain
please
what
you
mean
by
his
goings
on
is
he
in
debt
to
you
madeleine
continued
her
interrogatory
well
i
ca
just
say
that
replied
the
woman
with
what
seemed
a
spice
of
regret
he
paid
up
pretty
regular
till
now
though
of
course
one
never
knows
how
long
he
keep
on
doing
it
but
it
goes
against
my
heart
to
see
a
young
man
who
might
be
one
own
son
acting
as
he
does
when
he
first
came
here
there
was
a
decenter
young
man
anywhere
than
herr
guest
if
i
had
a
complaint
it
was
that
he
was
too
much
of
a
i
used
to
tell
him
he
ought
to
take
more
heed
for
his
health
not
to
mention
the
ears
of
the
people
that
had
to
live
with
him
he
sat
at
that
piano
there
all
the
blessed
day
and
now
there
is
a
lazier
more
cantankerous
fellow
in
the
place
you
ca
please
him
anyhow
he
never
gives
you
a
civil
word
he
does
work
he
does
cat
and
he
getting
so
thin
that
his
clothes
just
hang
on
him
is
he
drinking
interrupted
madeleine
in
the
same
way
with
her
eye
on
the
main
points
of
probable
offence
well
i
ca
just
say
that
answered
frau
krause
not
but
what
it
might
be
better
if
he
was
it
the
ones
as
do
drink
who
are
the
hard
ones
to
get
on
with
in
my
experience
young
gentlemen
who
like
their
liquor
are
of
the
goodnatured
sort
now
i
once
had
a
young
fellow
here
but
i
do
see
in
the
least
what
you
got
to
complain
of
said
madeleine
he
pays
you
for
the
room
and
you
no
doubt
have
free
use
of
a
very
good
bargain
she
sat
back
and
stared
about
her
while
frau
krause
recognising
that
she
had
met
her
match
in
this
young
lady
curbed
her
temper
and
launched
out
into
the
history
of
a
former
lodger
it
was
a
dingy
room
long
and
narrow
with
a
single
window
against
the
door
that
led
into
an
adjoining
room
stood
a
uninviting
sofa
with
a
table
in
front
of
it
between
this
and
the
window
was
the
a
flat
piece
of
furniture
with
drawers
and
and
a
broad
flap
that
let
down
for
writing
purposes
against
the
opposite
wall
stood
the
neglected
piano
and
towards
the
door
on
both
sides
were
huddled
bed
washstand
and
the
iron
stove
everything
was
of
an
extreme
shabbiness
the
stuffing
was
showing
through
holes
in
the
sofa
the
strips
of
carpet
were
worn
threadbare
a
couple
of
photographs
and
a
few
books
were
ranged
in
line
on
the
bureau
that
was
all
that
had
been
done
towards
giving
the
place
a
homely
air
it
was
like
a
room
that
had
never
properly
been
lived
in
while
madeleine
sat
thinking
this
the
sound
of
a
key
was
heard
in
the
front
door
and
frau
krause
interrupted
in
her
story
had
just
time
to
tap
madeleine
on
the
arm
exclaim
here
he
is
and
dart
out
of
the
room
not
so
promptly
however
but
what
maurice
saw
where
she
came
from
madeleine
heard
them
bandying
words
in
the
passage
the
door
of
the
room
was
flung
open
and
maurice
entering
hotly
threw
his
hat
on
the
table
he
did
not
perceive
his
visitor
till
it
was
too
late
madeleine
you
here
he
exclaimed
in
surprise
and
embarrassment
i
beg
your
pardon
i
did
see
you
and
he
made
haste
to
recover
his
hat
yes
do
faint
it
i
but
what
the
matter
why
are
you
so
angry
with
the
person
does
she
pry
on
you
pry
he
echoed
and
his
colour
deepened
pry
not
the
word
for
it
she
ransacks
everything
i
have
i
never
come
home
but
what
i
find
she
has
overhauled
something
though
i
forbidden
her
to
enter
the
room
why
do
you
or
rather
why
did
you
move
it
not
much
of
a
place
i
sure
move
he
repeated
in
the
same
tone
as
before
and
as
he
spoke
he
looked
incredulously
at
madeleine
he
had
hung
his
coat
and
hat
on
a
peg
and
now
came
forward
to
the
table
move
he
said
once
again
and
prolonged
the
word
as
though
the
channel
of
thought
it
opened
up
was
new
to
him
good
gracious
yes
if
one
not
satisfied
with
one
rooms
one
moves
that
all
there
nothing
strange
about
it
he
murmured
that
the
idea
had
never
occurred
to
him
and
was
about
to
draw
up
a
chair
when
his
eye
caught
a
letter
that
was
lying
on
the
lowered
flap
of
the
bureau
in
patent
agitation
and
without
excusing
himself
he
seized
it
and
tore
it
open
madeleine
saw
his
face
darken
he
read
the
letter
through
twice
from
beginning
to
end
then
tore
it
into
a
dozen
pieces
and
scattered
them
on
the
shelf
no
bad
news
i
hope
he
turned
his
face
to
her
it
was
still
contracted
that
depends
on
how
you
look
at
it
madeleine
he
said
and
laughed
in
an
unpleasant
manner
after
this
he
seemed
to
forget
her
again
he
stood
staring
at
the
scraps
of
paper
with
a
frown
for
some
minutes
she
waited
then
she
saw
herself
forced
to
recall
him
to
the
fact
of
her
presence
could
you
spare
me
a
little
attention
now
she
asked
at
her
words
he
jumped
and
with
evident
confusion
brought
his
wandering
thoughts
home
i
ca
sit
here
for
ever
you
know
she
added
i
beg
your
pardon
he
came
up
to
the
table
and
took
the
chair
he
had
previously
had
his
hand
on
the
fact
is
i
can
i
do
anything
for
you
madeleine
for
me
oh
dear
no
you
are
surprised
to
find
me
here
no
doubt
but
as
i
leaving
morning
i
thought
i
run
up
and
say
to
you
that
all
a
case
of
mohammed
and
the
mountain
you
see
leaving
goodness
there
nothing
wonderful
in
that
is
there
most
people
do
leave
some
time
or
other
you
know
his
reply
was
inaudible
it
was
very
good
of
you
to
look
me
up
he
threw
in
as
an
afterthought
madeleine
watching
him
with
a
thin
sarcastic
smile
on
her
lips
had
chanced
to
let
her
eyes
stray
to
his
hands
which
he
had
laid
on
the
table
and
she
continued
to
fix
them
fascinated
in
spite
of
herself
by
the
condition
of
the
nails
these
were
bitten
and
broken
and
dirty
maurice
becoming
aware
of
her
intent
gaze
looked
down
to
see
what
it
was
at
hastily
withdrew
his
hands
and
hid
them
in
his
pockets
this
is
the
first
time
i
been
in
your
den
you
know
she
said
abruptly
really
maurice
you
might
have
done
better
i
do
know
how
you
managed
to
put
up
with
it
so
long
my
dear
madeleine
do
you
think
i
could
afford
to
live
in
a
palace
a
palace
absurd
you
probably
pay
sixteen
or
seventeen
marks
for
this
hole
well
i
could
have
found
you
any
number
of
better
places
for
the
same
money
if
you
had
come
to
me
you
very
kind
but
it
has
done
me
well
enough
so
it
appears
sitting
back
she
looked
round
her
in
the
hope
of
picking
up
some
neutral
subject
are
those
your
people
she
asked
and
nodded
at
the
photograph
of
a
which
stood
on
the
top
shelf
of
the
bureau
three
boys
are
you
not
you
are
like
your
mother
and
she
stared
with
unfeigned
curiosity
at
the
provincial
figures
dressed
out
in
their
best
coats
and
silks
and
in
heavy
gold
jewellery
good
god
madeleine
maurice
burst
out
at
this
his
loosely
kept
patience
escaping
him
you
did
come
here
i
suppose
to
remark
on
my
family
well
i
ca
congratulate
you
on
an
improvement
in
your
manners
since
i
saw
you
last
i
am
not
aware
of
having
changed
as
well
for
you
perhaps
however
i
tell
you
about
myself
if
it
interests
you
she
turned
her
cool
judicial
gaze
on
him
again
and
now
she
set
before
him
her
projects
for
the
future
but
though
he
kept
his
eyes
fastened
on
her
face
she
saw
that
he
was
not
listening
to
what
she
said
or
at
most
that
he
only
half
heard
it
for
when
she
ceased
to
speak
he
did
not
notice
her
silence
she
waited
curious
to
see
what
would
come
next
and
presently
he
echoed
in
his
vague
way
paris
did
you
say
really
yes
paris
the
capital
of
i
said
that
and
a
good
deal
more
which
i
do
think
you
and
now
i
wo
take
up
your
precious
time
any
you
nothing
new
to
tell
me
i
suppose
you
still
intend
staying
on
here
and
fighting
out
the
problem
of
existence
well
when
you
have
starved
satisfactorily
in
a
garret
i
hope
some
one
will
let
me
know
i
come
over
for
the
funeral
she
rose
and
began
to
button
her
jacket
and
england
has
absolutely
no
chance
english
music
must
continue
to
languish
without
hope
of
reform
how
can
you
remember
such
rot
i
was
a
terrible
fool
when
i
talked
like
that
i
liked
you
better
as
a
fool
than
i
do
now
with
your
acquired
wisdom
and
i
wo
go
from
here
without
offering
you
congratulations
hearty
congratulations
on
the
muddle
you
made
of
things
that
entirely
my
own
affair
you
may
be
thankful
it
is
do
you
think
anyone
else
would
want
the
responsibility
of
it
she
went
out
without
a
further
word
but
on
the
landing
at
the
bottom
of
the
first
flight
of
stairs
she
stood
irresolute
she
felt
annoyed
with
herself
that
she
had
allowed
an
unfriendly
tone
to
dominate
their
brief
interview
this
was
probably
the
last
time
she
would
see
him
the
last
chance
she
would
have
of
telling
him
just
what
she
thought
of
him
and
viewed
in
that
light
it
seemed
ridiculous
to
let
any
artificial
delicacy
of
feeling
stand
in
her
way
she
blew
her
nose
vigorously
and
not
being
used
to
indecision
turned
as
she
did
so
and
began
to
ascend
the
stairs
again
brushing
past
frau
krause
she
reopened
without
knocking
the
door
of
maurice
room
he
had
moved
the
lamp
from
the
table
to
the
bureau
and
at
her
entrance
was
bending
over
something
that
lay
there
so
engrossed
that
he
did
not
at
once
raise
his
head
good
gracious
what
are
you
doing
escaped
her
involuntarily
at
this
he
spun
round
and
leaning
back
against
the
writingtable
tried
to
screen
it
from
her
eyes
she
regretted
her
impulsive
curiosity
and
did
not
press
him
yes
it
me
again
she
said
with
determination
and
i
suppose
you
want
to
accuse
me
of
prying
too
like
that
female
look
here
ludicrous
for
us
who
have
been
friends
so
long
to
part
in
this
fashion
and
i
for
one
do
intend
to
do
it
there
something
i
want
to
say
before
i
go
you
may
be
angry
and
offended
if
you
like
i
care
for
he
frowned
forbiddingly
i
no
denser
than
other
people
and
i
know
just
as
well
as
every
one
else
the
wretched
mess
you
got
yourself
into
one
would
have
to
be
blind
and
deaf
indeed
not
to
now
look
here
maurice
you
once
said
to
me
you
may
remember
that
if
you
had
a
sister
you
like
her
to
be
something
like
me
will
you
look
on
me
as
that
sister
for
a
little
and
let
me
give
you
some
sound
advice
i
told
you
i
was
going
to
paris
and
that
i
had
a
clear
month
there
well
now
throw
your
things
together
and
come
with
me
you
have
had
a
decent
holiday
since
you
been
here
you
need
freshening
or
if
not
paris
paris
is
a
necessity
we
go
down
by
munich
and
the
brenner
to
italy
and
i
be
cicerone
i
act
as
banker
too
and
you
can
regard
it
as
a
loan
in
the
meantime
and
pay
me
back
when
you
now
what
do
you
say
does
the
plan
tempt
you
what
i
say
he
echoed
and
looked
round
him
a
little
helplessly
why
madeleine
it
seems
you
are
determined
to
run
off
with
me
once
it
was
america
and
now
it
italy
or
paris
come
say
you
consent
or
at
least
consider
it
my
dear
madeleine
you
all
that
is
good
and
kind
but
you
know
you
only
talking
nonsense
she
did
not
answer
him
at
once
the
thing
is
this
she
said
with
some
hesitation
i
was
quite
honest
in
what
i
said
to
you
a
few
minutes
ago
i
have
the
uncomfortable
feeling
that
i
am
to
a
certain
degree
responsible
even
to
blame
for
much
of
what
has
happened
here
and
it
is
a
pleasant
feeling
maurice
my
dear
girl
he
said
again
if
it
any
consolation
to
you
to
know
it
i
owe
you
the
biggest
debt
of
my
life
then
you
decline
my
proposal
do
you
you
the
same
good
friend
you
always
were
but
you
making
a
mountain
out
of
a
molehill
what
all
this
fuss
about
merely
because
i
have
chosen
to
work
my
fingers
to
the
bone
and
wear
my
nerves
to
tatters
over
that
old
farce
of
a
prufung
as
for
my
choosing
to
stay
here
instead
of
going
home
like
the
rest
of
you
well
that
a
matter
of
taste
too
some
people
like
our
friend
dove
want
affluence
and
a
fixed
position
in
the
provinces
frankly
i
do
i
rather
scrape
along
here
as
best
i
can
that
the
whole
matter
in
a
nutshell
and
it
nothing
to
make
a
about
for
though
you
think
i
a
fool
and
ca
help
telling
me
so
that
too
is
a
matter
of
opinion
well
i
do
intend
to
apologise
for
myself
at
this
date
be
sure
of
that
and
now
i
go
for
if
you
resolved
to
hold
me
at
length
there
nothing
more
to
be
no
stop
a
minute
though
here
my
address
in
england
if
ever
you
should
return
to
join
us
benighted
ignorants
you
might
let
me
know
or
if
you
find
you
get
on
here
i
mean
if
it
quite
impossible
i
have
money
you
know
and
should
be
glad
at
a
proper
percentage
of
course
she
added
ironically
that
hardly
likely
to
happen
she
laid
the
card
on
the
table
you
never
can
well
then
and
in
spite
of
your
obstinacy
i
perhaps
be
able
to
do
you
a
good
turn
yet
maurice
guest
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
front
door
close
he
returned
to
his
occupation
of
piecing
together
the
bits
of
the
letter
ever
since
he
had
torn
it
up
throughout
her
visit
his
brain
had
been
struggling
to
recall
its
exact
contents
and
without
success
for
owing
to
presence
he
had
read
it
hastily
otherwise
what
he
had
done
did
not
differ
from
his
usual
method
of
proceeding
this
was
not
the
first
horrible
unsigned
letter
he
had
received
and
he
could
never
prevail
on
himself
to
throw
them
in
the
fire
unopened
he
read
them
through
two
or
three
times
then
angered
by
their
contents
and
by
his
own
weakness
tore
them
to
fragments
but
the
hints
and
aspersions
they
contained
remained
imprinted
on
his
mind
in
this
case
distracting
appearance
had
enfeebled
his
memory
and
he
worked
long
and
patiently
until
the
sheet
lay
fitted
together
again
before
him
when
he
knew
its
contents
by
heart
he
struck
some
matches
and
watched
the
pieces
curl
and
blacken
then
he
left
the
house
her
room
was
in
darkness
he
stretched
himself
on
the
sofa
to
wait
for
her
return
the
words
of
the
letter
danced
like
a
writing
of
fire
before
him
he
lay
there
and
them
but
without
anger
what
they
stated
might
be
true
also
it
might
not
he
would
never
know
for
these
letters
which
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
for
opening
and
still
more
for
remembering
had
not
been
mentioned
between
them
but
were
added
to
that
category
of
things
they
now
tacitly
agreed
to
avoid
in
his
heart
he
knew
that
he
cherished
the
present
state
of
uncertainty
it
was
a
twilight
state
without
crudities
or
sharp
outlines
and
it
was
still
possible
to
drift
and
dream
in
it
whereas
if
another
terrible
certainty
like
the
last
descended
on
him
he
would
be
forced
to
marshal
his
energies
and
to
suffer
afresh
it
was
better
not
to
know
as
long
as
definite
knowledge
failed
him
he
could
give
her
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
whether
what
the
letters
affirmed
was
true
or
not
hours
came
when
she
still
belonged
wholly
to
him
whatever
happened
on
her
absences
from
him
as
soon
as
the
four
walls
of
the
room
shut
them
in
again
she
was
his
and
each
time
she
returned
a
burning
gratitude
for
the
reprieve
filled
him
anew
but
there
was
also
another
reason
why
he
did
not
breathe
a
word
to
her
of
his
suspicions
and
that
was
the
slow
dread
that
was
laming
him
the
dread
of
her
contempt
she
made
no
further
attempt
to
drape
it
and
he
had
learned
to
writhe
before
it
to
cringe
and
go
softly
weeks
had
passed
now
since
the
night
on
which
he
had
made
his
last
stand
against
her
weeks
of
increasing
torture
just
at
first
incredible
as
it
had
seemed
his
horrible
treatment
of
her
had
brought
about
a
slackening
of
the
tension
between
them
the
worst
that
could
happen
had
happened
and
he
had
survived
it
he
had
not
put
an
end
either
to
himself
or
to
her
on
the
contrary
he
had
accepted
the
fact
as
he
now
saw
that
he
would
accept
every
fact
concerning
her
whether
for
good
or
evil
and
matters
having
reached
this
point
a
kind
of
lull
ensued
for
a
few
days
they
had
even
caught
a
glimpse
again
of
the
old
happiness
but
the
pause
was
it
was
like
the
ripples
caused
by
a
stone
thrown
into
water
which
continue
just
so
long
as
the
impetus
lasts
louise
had
been
a
little
awed
by
his
greater
strength
when
she
had
lain
cowering
on
the
ground
before
him
but
not
many
days
elapsed
before
her
eyes
were
wide
open
with
incredulous
amazement
when
she
understood
as
she
soon
did
that
her
shameless
admission
and
still
more
his
punishment
of
her
for
it
was
not
to
be
followed
up
by
any
new
development
that
in
place
of
subduing
her
mentally
as
well
he
was
going
to
be
content
to
live
on
as
they
had
been
doing
that
in
fact
he
had
already
dropped
back
into
the
old
state
of
things
before
she
was
well
aware
of
what
was
happening
then
her
passing
mood
of
submission
swept
over
into
her
old
flamboyant
contempt
for
him
the
fact
of
his
having
beaten
her
became
a
weapon
in
her
hands
and
she
used
it
unsparingly
to
her
taunts
he
had
no
answer
to
make
for
the
madness
once
passed
he
could
not
conceive
how
he
had
been
capable
of
such
a
thing
in
his
sane
moments
of
dejection
and
he
could
not
have
raised
his
hand
against
her
though
his
life
were
at
stake
he
had
never
been
able
to
drag
from
her
a
single
one
of
the
reasons
that
had
led
to
her
mad
betrayal
of
him
on
this
point
she
was
inflexible
in
the
course
of
that
long
night
which
he
had
spent
on
his
knees
by
her
bed
he
had
persecuted
her
to
disclose
her
motive
but
he
might
as
well
have
spoken
to
the
wind
his
questioning
elicited
no
again
and
again
he
had
upbraided
her
but
you
did
care
for
heinz
he
was
nothing
to
you
and
she
neither
assented
nor
gainsaid
him
once
however
she
had
broken
in
on
him
you
believed
bad
of
me
long
before
there
was
any
to
believe
now
you
have
something
to
go
on
and
still
again
when
the
sluggish
dawn
was
creeping
in
she
had
suddenly
turned
her
head
but
now
you
can
go
away
you
free
to
leave
me
nothing
binds
you
to
a
woman
like
me
who
ca
be
content
with
one
man
dizzy
with
fatigue
he
had
answered
no
if
you
think
that
if
you
did
it
just
to
be
rid
of
me
you
mistaken
from
this
night
on
they
had
never
reverted
to
the
subject
again
which
is
not
to
say
that
his
brain
did
not
work
furiously
at
it
the
search
for
a
clue
for
the
hidden
motive
was
now
his
eternal
occupation
but
to
her
he
was
silent
sheerly
from
the
dread
of
again
receiving
the
answer
take
me
as
i
am
or
leave
me
in
hours
such
as
the
present
or
in
the
agony
of
sleepless
nights
these
thoughts
rent
his
brain
the
question
was
such
an
involved
one
and
he
never
seemed
to
come
any
nearer
a
solution
of
it
sometimes
he
was
actually
tempted
to
believe
what
her
words
implied
that
it
had
been
wilfully
done
with
a
view
to
getting
rid
of
him
but
against
this
his
reason
protested
for
if
the
letter
from
krafft
had
not
arrived
he
would
have
known
nothing
he
did
not
believe
she
would
have
told
him
would
there
indeed
have
been
any
need
for
her
to
do
so
nothing
was
changed
between
them
she
lived
at
his
side
just
as
before
and
krafft
was
out
of
the
at
other
times
though
he
asked
himself
if
he
were
not
a
fool
to
be
surprised
at
what
had
occurred
had
not
all
roads
led
here
had
he
not
as
she
most
truly
said
for
long
harboured
the
unworthiest
suspicions
of
her
suspicions
which
were
tantamount
to
an
admission
on
his
part
that
his
love
was
no
longer
enough
for
her
to
have
done
this
and
afterwards
to
behave
as
if
she
had
been
guilty
of
an
unpardonable
crime
was
illogical
and
and
yet
again
there
came
moments
when
in
a
barbarous
clearness
of
vision
he
seemed
to
get
nearest
to
the
truth
under
certain
circumstances
so
he
now
told
himself
he
would
gladly
and
straightway
have
forgiven
her
if
she
had
been
drawn
irresistibly
to
another
by
one
of
those
sudden
outbursts
of
passion
before
which
she
was
incapable
of
remaining
steadfast
if
she
had
been
attracted
like
this
more
than
half
unwilling
wholly
humiliated
penitent
in
advance
yet
powerless
then
oh
then
how
willingly
he
would
have
made
allowance
for
her
weakness
but
krafft
of
all
people
krafft
of
whom
she
had
spoken
to
him
with
derisive
contempt
this
cold
and
calculated
deception
of
him
with
some
one
who
made
not
the
least
appeal
to
her
cold
and
calculated
did
he
say
no
far
from
it
what
could
it
have
been
but
the
sensual
caprice
of
a
moment
but
a
fleeting
manlike
desire
for
the
piquancy
of
change
these
and
similar
thoughts
ran
their
whirling
circles
behind
his
closed
eyes
as
he
lay
in
the
waning
twilight
of
the
march
evening
which
still
struggled
with
the
light
of
the
lamp
but
they
were
hard
pressed
by
the
contents
of
the
letter
on
this
night
he
foresaw
that
his
fixed
idea
threatened
to
divide
up
into
two
branches
and
he
did
not
know
whether
to
be
glad
or
to
regret
it
but
he
admitted
to
himself
that
one
of
these
days
he
would
be
forced
to
take
measures
for
preserving
his
sanity
by
somehow
dragging
the
truth
from
her
better
still
by
following
her
on
one
of
her
evening
absences
to
discover
for
himself
where
she
went
and
whether
what
the
anonymous
writer
asserted
was
true
if
he
could
only
have
controlled
his
brain
the
perpetually
repeated
circles
it
drove
in
if
these
could
once
have
been
brought
to
a
stop
all
the
rest
of
him
infinitely
preferred
not
to
know
meanwhile
the
shadows
deepened
and
his
subconsciousness
never
ceased
to
listen
with
an
intentness
which
no
whirligigs
of
thought
could
distract
for
the
sound
of
her
step
in
the
passage
when
at
length
some
short
time
after
darkness
had
set
in
he
heard
her
at
the
door
he
drew
a
long
sighing
breath
of
relief
as
if
though
this
was
unavowed
even
to
himself
he
had
been
afraid
he
might
listen
in
vain
and
as
always
when
the
suspense
was
over
and
she
was
under
the
same
roof
with
him
again
he
was
freed
from
so
intolerable
a
weight
that
he
was
ready
to
endure
whatever
she
might
choose
to
put
upon
him
and
for
his
part
to
make
no
demands
louise
entered
languidly
and
so
skilled
had
he
grown
at
interpreting
her
moods
that
he
knew
from
her
very
walk
which
of
them
she
was
in
he
looked
surreptitiously
at
her
and
saw
that
she
was
wan
and
tired
it
had
been
a
mild
enervating
day
her
hair
was
blown
rough
about
her
face
he
watched
her
before
the
mirror
take
off
hat
and
veil
with
slow
yet
impatient
fingers
watched
her
hands
in
her
hair
which
she
did
not
trouble
to
rearrange
but
only
smoothed
back
on
either
side
she
had
not
even
in
entering
cast
a
glance
at
him
and
recognising
the
rasped
state
of
her
nerves
he
had
the
intent
to
be
cautious
but
his
resolutions
however
good
were
not
long
proof
against
her
neglect
of
his
her
wilful
preoccupation
with
herself
and
with
inanimate
objects
exasperated
him
everything
was
of
more
worth
to
her
than
he
was
and
she
delighted
to
show
it
have
you
a
word
for
me
do
you
see
i
here
he
asked
at
length
even
now
she
did
not
look
towards
him
as
she
answered
of
course
i
see
you
but
shall
i
speak
next
to
the
furniture
of
the
room
so
that
what
i
am
is
it
a
piece
of
your
furniture
no
worse
furniture
is
silent
she
was
changing
her
for
the
this
done
she
dabbed
powder
on
her
face
out
of
a
small
oval
glass
pot
a
habit
of
hers
to
which
he
had
never
grown
accustomed
stop
putting
that
stuff
on
your
face
you
know
i
hate
it
her
only
answer
was
to
dab
anew
and
so
thickly
that
the
powder
was
strewn
over
the
front
of
her
dress
and
the
floor
the
clothes
she
had
taken
off
were
flung
on
a
chair
as
she
brushed
past
them
they
fell
to
the
ground
she
did
not
stoop
to
pick
them
up
but
pushed
them
out
of
the
way
with
her
foot
sitting
down
in
the
she
closed
her
eyes
and
spread
her
arms
out
along
the
arms
of
the
chair
he
could
not
see
her
from
where
he
lay
but
she
was
within
reach
of
him
and
after
a
brief
unhappy
silence
he
put
out
his
hand
and
drew
the
chair
towards
him
urging
it
forward
inch
by
inch
until
it
was
beside
the
sofa
then
he
pulled
her
head
down
so
that
it
also
lay
on
the
cushion
and
he
could
feel
her
hair
against
his
how
you
hate
me
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
as
though
he
were
speaking
to
himself
laying
her
hand
on
his
forehead
he
made
of
it
a
screen
for
his
eyes
who
could
have
foreseen
this
he
said
again
in
the
same
toneless
way
louise
lay
still
and
did
not
speak
why
do
you
stay
with
me
he
went
on
looking
out
from
under
her
hand
i
often
ask
myself
that
for
you
free
to
come
and
go
as
you
choose
her
eyes
opened
at
this
though
he
did
not
see
it
and
i
choose
to
stay
here
how
often
am
i
to
tell
you
that
why
do
you
come
back
on
it
i
tired
tired
i
know
you
are
i
saw
it
as
soon
as
you
came
in
it
been
a
tiring
day
and
you
probably
walked
too
far
with
a
jerk
she
drew
her
hand
out
of
his
and
sat
upright
in
her
chair
something
a
mere
tone
the
slight
pause
in
his
apparently
harmless
words
incensed
her
too
far
did
i
oh
at
least
be
honest
why
do
you
ask
me
straight
out
where
i
have
been
and
what
i
have
done
ca
you
for
once
be
man
enough
to
put
an
open
question
nothing
was
further
from
my
mind
than
to
make
implications
it
you
who
so
suspicious
just
as
if
you
had
a
bad
conscience
something
really
to
conceal
take
care
or
i
shall
tell
you
where
i
been
and
you
might
regret
it
no
for
god
sake
no
more
confessions
she
laughed
and
lay
back
but
a
moment
later
she
cried
out
why
do
you
go
away
yourself
you
know
i
loathe
the
sight
of
you
and
yet
you
stick
on
here
like
like
a
leech
go
away
oh
why
ca
you
go
away
i
might
have
taken
you
at
your
word
at
the
mention
of
madeleine
name
she
pricked
up
her
ears
oho
she
said
when
lie
had
finished
his
story
so
madeleine
pays
you
visits
does
she
the
sainted
madeleine
you
have
her
there
and
me
a
pretty
state
of
things
hold
your
tongue
i
not
in
the
mood
to
stand
your
gibes
but
i
in
the
mood
to
make
them
and
how
is
one
to
help
it
when
one
hears
that
that
ineffable
creature
is
no
better
than
she
ought
to
be
hold
your
tongue
he
cried
again
how
dare
you
speak
like
that
of
the
girl
who
has
been
such
a
good
friend
to
me
friend
she
echoed
what
fools
men
are
she
in
love
with
you
that
all
and
always
has
been
but
you
were
never
man
enough
to
know
what
it
was
she
wanted
your
friend
ah
you
the
nervous
strain
of
the
afternoon
reached
its
climax
you
yes
that
you
all
over
in
your
eyes
nothing
is
good
or
pure
and
you
make
everything
you
touch
dirty
you
not
fit
to
take
a
decent
woman
name
on
your
lips
she
sprang
up
from
her
chair
and
that
my
thanks
for
all
done
all
i
sacrificed
for
you
i
not
fit
to
take
a
decent
name
on
my
lips
for
shame
for
shame
for
who
has
made
me
what
i
am
but
you
oh
what
a
fool
i
was
ever
to
let
you
cross
this
door
you
a
man
who
is
content
with
other
men
leavings
it
was
the
worst
day
work
you
ever
did
in
your
life
everything
bad
has
come
from
why
could
you
have
held
back
and
refused
me
we
might
still
have
been
decent
happy
creatures
if
you
had
let
your
vile
nature
get
the
better
of
you
you
would
marry
me
no
no
you
prefer
to
take
your
pleasure
in
other
a
man
at
any
cost
madeleine
said
once
and
god
knows
i
believe
it
was
true
she
struck
him
in
the
face
oh
you
miserable
scoundrel
you
who
never
looked
at
me
but
with
the
one
thought
in
your
head
oh
it
too
much
never
never
while
i
live
i
would
rather
die
shall
you
ever
touch
me
again
she
continued
to
weep
long
after
he
had
left
her
still
crying
her
handkerchief
pressed
to
her
eyes
her
body
shaken
by
her
sobs
she
moved
blindly
about
the
room
opening
drawers
and
cupboards
and
heaping
up
their
contents
on
the
bed
there
was
a
limit
to
everything
she
could
bear
her
life
with
him
no
longer
and
with
nerveless
fingers
she
strove
to
collect
and
pack
her
belongings
preparatory
to
going
away
xii
easter
fell
early
and
the
ninth
symphony
had
been
performed
in
the
gewandhaus
before
march
was
fairly
out
now
both
conservatorium
and
gewandhaus
were
closed
and
the
familiar
haunts
were
empty
hitherto
maurice
had
made
shift
to
preserve
appearances
at
intervals
not
too
conspicuously
far
apart
he
had
gone
backwards
and
forwards
to
his
classes
keeping
his
head
above
water
with
a
minimum
of
work
now
however
there
was
no
further
need
for
deceiving
people
most
of
those
who
had
been
his
had
left
leipzig
he
could
not
put
his
finger
on
a
single
person
remaining
with
whom
he
had
had
a
nearer
acquaintance
no
one
was
left
to
comment
on
what
he
did
and
how
he
lived
and
this
knowledge
withdrew
the
last
prop
from
his
sense
of
propriety
he
ceased
to
face
the
trouble
that
care
for
his
person
implied
just
as
he
gave
up
raising
the
lid
of
the
piano
and
making
a
needless
pretence
of
work
openly
now
he
took
up
his
abode
in
the
bruderstrasse
where
he
spent
the
long
idle
days
stretched
on
the
sofa
rolling
cigarettes
in
far
greater
numbers
than
he
could
smoke
and
vacantly
yet
with
a
kind
of
gusto
as
if
his
fingers
so
long
accustomed
to
violent
exercise
had
a
relish
for
the
task
he
was
seldom
free
from
headache
an
iron
ring
which
it
was
impossible
to
loosen
bound
his
forehead
his
disinclination
to
speech
grew
upon
him
too
not
only
had
he
no
thoughts
that
it
was
worth
breaking
the
silence
to
express
the
effort
demanded
by
the
forming
of
words
was
too
great
for
him
his
feeling
of
indifference
grew
so
strong
that
sometimes
he
felt
it
beyond
his
strength
consciously
to
take
in
the
shape
of
the
objects
about
the
room
the
days
were
eventless
he
lay
and
watched
her
movements
which
were
spiritless
and
hurried
by
turns
but
now
seldom
marked
by
the
gracious
impulsiveness
that
had
made
up
so
large
a
part
of
her
charm
he
was
content
to
live
from
hour
to
hour
at
her
side
for
that
this
was
his
last
respite
he
well
knew
and
the
further
the
month
advanced
the
more
tenaciously
he
clung
the
one
thought
which
now
had
force
to
rouse
him
was
that
the
day
would
come
on
which
he
would
see
her
face
for
the
last
time
the
fact
that
she
had
given
herself
to
another
while
yet
belonging
to
him
ceased
to
affect
him
displeasurably
as
did
also
his
fixed
idea
that
she
was
at
the
present
moment
deceiving
him
anew
his
sole
obsession
was
now
a
fear
of
the
inevitable
end
and
it
was
this
fear
which
at
rare
intervals
broke
the
taciturn
dejection
in
which
he
was
sunk
by
giving
rise
to
appalling
fits
of
violence
but
after
a
scene
of
this
kind
he
would
half
suffocate
her
with
remorse
and
this
perhaps
worked
destruction
most
surely
of
all
the
knowledge
that
despite
the
ungovernable
aversion
she
felt
for
him
she
could
still
tolerate
his
endearments
not
once
as
long
as
they
had
been
together
had
she
refused
to
be
caressed
but
the
impossibility
of
the
life
they
were
leading
broke
over
louise
at
times
with
the
shock
of
an
wave
if
you
have
any
feeling
left
in
you
if
you
have
ever
cared
for
me
in
the
least
go
away
now
she
wept
go
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
only
leave
me
he
was
giddy
with
headache
that
day
to
whom
who
is
it
you
want
now
one
afternoon
as
he
lay
there
the
landlady
came
in
with
a
telegram
for
him
which
she
said
had
been
brought
round
by
one
of
frau
children
she
tossed
it
on
the
table
as
she
spoke
to
express
the
contempt
she
felt
for
him
several
minutes
elapsed
before
he
put
out
his
hand
for
it
and
then
he
did
so
because
it
required
less
energy
to
open
it
than
to
leave
it
unopened
when
he
had
read
it
he
gave
a
short
laugh
and
threw
it
back
on
the
table
louise
who
was
in
the
other
part
of
the
room
came
out
to
see
what
the
matter
was
she
tool
laughed
at
its
contents
in
her
insolent
way
and
on
passing
the
pulled
open
the
drawer
where
she
kept
her
money
there
enough
for
two
and
you
no
prouder
in
this
i
suppose
than
in
anything
else
the
peremptory
summons
home
and
the
announcement
that
no
further
allowance
would
be
remitted
was
not
a
surprise
to
him
he
had
known
all
along
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
be
thrown
on
his
own
resources
it
had
happened
a
little
earlier
than
he
had
expected
that
was
all
a
week
had
still
to
run
till
the
end
of
the
that
night
however
when
louise
was
out
he
meditated
in
a
desultory
fashion
over
the
likely
and
unlikely
occupations
to
which
he
could
turn
his
hand
a
few
days
later
she
came
home
one
evening
in
a
different
mood
for
once
no
cruel
words
crossed
her
lips
they
sat
side
by
side
on
the
sofa
and
of
such
stuff
was
happiness
now
made
that
he
was
content
chancing
to
look
up
he
was
dismayed
to
see
that
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
which
as
he
watched
ran
over
and
down
her
cheeks
he
slid
to
his
knees
and
laid
his
head
in
her
lap
she
fell
asleep
early
for
no
matter
what
happened
how
uneventful
or
how
tragically
exciting
her
day
was
her
faculty
for
sleep
remained
unchanged
it
was
a
brilliant
night
in
the
sky
was
a
great
round
yellow
moon
and
the
room
was
lit
up
by
it
the
blind
of
the
window
facing
the
bed
had
not
been
lowered
and
a
square
patch
of
light
fell
across
the
bed
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
lying
in
it
her
face
was
towards
him
one
arm
was
flung
up
above
her
head
the
hand
lay
with
the
palm
exposed
something
in
the
look
of
the
face
blanched
by
the
unreal
light
made
him
recall
the
first
time
he
had
seen
it
and
the
impression
it
had
then
left
on
his
mind
while
she
played
in
room
she
had
turned
and
looked
at
him
and
it
had
seemed
to
him
then
that
some
occult
force
had
gone
out
from
the
face
and
struck
home
in
him
and
it
had
never
lessened
strange
that
so
small
a
thing
hardly
bigger
than
one
two
closed
fists
should
be
able
to
exert
such
an
influence
over
one
for
this
face
it
was
the
pale
oval
in
the
dark
setting
the
exotic
colouring
the
eyes
which
held
him
it
was
this
face
which
drew
him
surely
back
with
a
vital
nostalgia
a
homesickness
for
the
sight
of
her
and
the
touch
of
her
if
he
were
too
long
absent
it
had
not
been
any
coincidence
of
temperament
or
sympathies
by
rights
all
the
rights
of
their
different
natures
they
had
not
belonged
together
any
more
than
it
had
been
a
mere
blind
uprush
of
sensual
desire
and
just
as
his
feelings
for
her
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
reason
or
with
the
practical
conduct
of
his
life
so
they
had
outlasted
tenderness
faithfulness
respect
what
ever
it
was
that
held
him
it
lay
deeper
than
these
conventional
ideas
of
virtue
the
power
her
face
had
over
him
was
undiminished
though
he
now
found
it
neither
beautiful
nor
good
though
he
knew
the
true
meaning
of
each
deeply
graven
this
then
was
love
this
morbid
possession
by
a
woman
face
he
laid
his
arm
across
his
tired
eyes
and
without
waiting
to
consider
the
question
he
had
propounded
commenced
to
follow
out
a
new
train
of
thought
no
doubt
for
each
individual
there
existed
in
one
other
mortal
some
physical
detail
which
he
or
she
could
find
only
in
this
particular
person
it
might
be
the
veriest
trifle
some
found
it
it
seemed
in
the
colour
of
an
eye
some
in
the
modulations
of
a
voice
the
curve
of
a
lip
the
shape
of
a
hand
the
lines
of
a
body
in
motion
whatever
it
chanced
to
be
it
was
in
most
cases
an
insignificant
characteristic
which
for
others
simply
did
not
exist
but
which
to
the
one
affected
by
it
made
instant
appeal
and
just
to
that
corner
of
the
soul
which
had
hitherto
suffered
aimlessly
for
the
want
of
it
a
suffering
which
nothing
but
this
intonation
this
particular
smile
could
allay
he
himself
had
long
since
learnt
what
it
was
about
her
face
that
made
a
like
appeal
to
him
it
was
her
eyes
not
their
size
or
their
dark
brilliancy
but
the
manner
of
their
setting
the
spacious
lid
that
fell
from
the
high
wavy
eyebrow
first
sloping
deeply
inwards
then
curving
out
again
over
the
eyeball
this
and
the
clean
sweep
of
the
broad
white
lid
which
when
lowered
gave
the
face
an
infantine
look
a
look
of
marble
he
knew
it
was
this
for
on
the
strength
of
a
mere
hinted
resemblance
he
had
been
unable
to
take
his
eyes
off
the
face
of
another
woman
the
likeness
in
this
detail
had
met
his
gaze
with
a
kind
of
shock
but
what
a
meaningless
thing
was
life
when
the
way
a
lid
drooped
or
an
eyebrow
grew
on
a
forehead
could
make
such
havoc
of
your
nerves
and
more
especially
when
in
the
brain
or
soul
that
lay
behind
no
spiritual
trait
answered
to
the
well
that
was
for
others
to
puzzle
over
not
for
him
the
strong
man
tore
himself
away
while
there
was
still
time
or
saved
himself
in
an
engrossing
pursuit
he
having
had
neither
strength
nor
saving
occupation
had
bartered
all
he
had
and
knowingly
for
the
beauty
of
this
face
and
as
long
as
it
existed
for
him
his
home
was
beside
it
he
turned
restlessly
disturbed
in
her
dreams
louise
flung
over
on
her
other
side
eugen
she
murmured
save
me
here
i
am
oh
do
you
see
me
he
shook
her
by
the
arm
wake
up
she
was
startled
and
angry
wo
you
even
let
me
sleep
keep
your
dreams
to
yourself
then
there
was
a
savage
hatred
in
her
look
oh
if
i
only
could
if
only
my
hands
were
strong
enough
i
kill
you
you
done
your
best
yes
and
i
glad
remember
that
afterwards
i
was
glad
it
had
been
a
radiant
april
morning
of
breeze
and
sunshine
but
towards
midday
clouds
gathered
and
the
sunlight
was
constantly
intercepted
maurice
had
had
occasion
to
fetch
something
from
his
lodgings
and
was
on
his
way
back
the
streets
were
thronged
with
people
business
men
and
students
returning
to
work
from
the
restaurants
in
which
they
had
dined
at
a
corner
of
the
zeitzerstrasse
a
had
been
overturned
and
a
crowd
had
gathered
for
no
matter
how
busy
people
were
they
had
time
to
gape
and
stare
and
they
were
now
as
eager
as
children
to
observe
this
incident
in
the
development
of
which
a
stout
policeman
was
wordily
authoritative
maurice
found
that
he
had
loitered
with
the
rest
to
watch
the
gathering
up
of
the
spilt
wares
and
to
hear
the
ensuing
altercation
between
hawker
and
policeman
on
turning
to
walk
on
again
his
eye
was
caught
and
held
by
the
tall
figure
of
a
man
who
was
going
in
the
same
direction
as
he
but
at
a
brisk
pace
and
several
yards
in
front
of
him
this
person
must
have
passed
the
group
round
the
cart
now
intervening
heads
and
shoulders
divided
them
obstructing
maurice
view
still
signs
were
not
wanting
in
him
that
his
subliminal
consciousness
was
beginning
to
recognise
the
man
who
walked
ahead
there
was
something
oddly
familiar
in
the
gait
in
the
droop
of
the
shoulders
the
nervous
movement
of
the
head
the
aimless
motion
of
the
dangling
hands
and
arms
briefly
in
all
the
loosely
hung
body
and
besides
this
the
felt
hat
good
god
he
stiffened
with
a
sudden
start
and
in
an
instant
his
entire
attention
was
concentrated
in
an
effort
to
see
the
colour
of
the
hair
under
the
hat
was
it
red
he
tried
to
strike
out
in
lengthier
steps
but
the
legs
of
the
man
in
front
were
longer
and
his
own
unruly
after
a
moment
indecision
however
he
mastered
them
and
then
so
afraid
was
he
of
the
other
passing
out
of
sight
that
he
all
but
ran
and
kept
this
pace
up
till
he
was
close
behind
the
man
he
followed
there
he
fell
into
a
walk
again
but
a
weak
and
difficult
walk
for
his
heart
was
leaping
in
his
chest
he
had
not
been
mistaken
the
person
close
before
him
so
close
that
he
could
almost
have
touched
him
was
no
other
than
schilsky
the
schilsky
of
old
with
the
insolent
eyes
and
the
loose
easy
walk
maurice
followed
him
followed
warily
and
yet
unreflectingly
right
down
the
long
populous
street
sometimes
blindly
too
for
when
the
street
and
all
it
contained
swam
before
him
he
was
obliged
to
shut
his
eyes
people
looked
with
attention
at
him
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
himself
in
a
barber
mirror
and
saw
that
his
face
had
turned
a
greenish
white
his
mind
was
set
on
one
point
arrived
at
the
corner
where
the
street
ran
out
into
the
konigsplatz
which
turning
would
schilsky
take
would
he
go
to
the
right
where
lay
the
bruderstrasse
or
would
he
take
the
lower
street
to
the
left
until
this
question
was
answered
it
was
impossible
to
decide
what
should
be
done
next
but
first
there
came
a
lengthy
pause
schilsky
entered
a
musicshop
and
remained
inside
leaning
over
the
counter
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
finally
however
the
corner
was
reached
he
appeared
to
hesitate
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
going
straight
on
which
would
mean
fresh
uncertainty
then
with
a
sudden
outward
fling
of
the
hands
he
went
off
to
the
left
in
the
direction
of
the
gewandhaus
maurice
did
not
follow
him
any
further
he
stood
and
watched
until
he
could
no
longer
see
the
swaying
head
after
that
he
had
a
kind
of
collapse
he
leaned
up
against
the
wall
of
a
house
and
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
passers
by
believed
him
to
be
drunk
and
were
either
amused
or
horrified
or
saddened
he
discovered
in
truth
that
his
legs
were
shaking
as
if
with
an
ague
and
stumbling
into
a
neighbouring
he
drank
brandy
not
enough
to
stupefy
him
only
to
give
back
to
his
legs
their
missing
strength
to
postpone
her
knowing
to
hinder
her
from
knowing
at
any
cost
his
blurred
thoughts
got
no
further
than
this
he
covered
the
ground
at
a
mad
pace
clinging
fast
to
the
belief
that
he
would
find
her
as
he
had
left
her
in
bed
but
his
first
glimpse
of
her
turned
him
cold
she
was
standing
before
the
glass
dressed
to
go
out
this
in
itself
was
bad
enough
worse
far
worse
was
it
that
she
had
put
on
one
of
the
light
thin
dresses
she
had
worn
the
previous
spring
and
never
since
it
was
impossible
to
see
her
tricked
out
in
this
fashion
and
doubt
her
knowledge
of
the
damning
fact
he
held
it
for
proved
that
she
was
dressed
to
leave
him
and
the
sight
of
her
refreshed
and
rejuvenated
gave
the
last
thrust
to
his
tottering
sense
he
demanded
with
such
savageness
the
meaning
of
her
adornment
that
the
indignant
amazement
with
which
she
turned
on
him
was
real
and
not
feigned
take
off
that
dress
you
sha
go
out
of
the
house
in
it
take
it
off
he
raved
threatened
implored
always
with
icy
fingers
at
his
heart
he
knew
that
she
knew
he
would
have
taken
his
oath
on
it
and
he
only
had
room
in
his
brain
for
one
thought
to
prevent
her
knowing
his
rage
spent
itself
on
the
light
flowery
dress
as
nothing
he
said
moved
her
he
set
his
foot
on
the
skirt
and
tore
it
down
from
the
waist
she
struck
at
him
for
this
then
took
another
from
the
wardrobe
a
still
lighter
and
gaudier
one
they
had
never
yet
gone
through
an
hour
such
as
that
which
followed
at
its
expiry
clothes
and
furniture
lay
strewn
about
the
room
when
louise
saw
that
he
was
not
to
be
shaken
off
that
wherever
she
went
on
this
day
he
would
go
too
she
gave
up
any
plan
she
might
have
had
and
followed
where
he
led
this
was
as
swiftly
as
possible
by
the
outlying
road
to
the
connewitz
woods
if
he
could
but
once
get
her
there
they
would
be
safe
from
surprise
once
out
there
in
solitude
among
the
screening
trees
something
he
did
not
yet
know
what
but
something
would
must
happen
he
dragged
her
relentlessly
along
but
until
they
got
there
his
eyes
grew
stiff
and
giddy
with
looking
before
him
behind
him
on
all
sides
and
never
had
she
seemed
to
move
so
slowly
never
had
she
stared
so
brazenly
about
her
as
on
this
afternoon
with
every
step
they
took
certainty
burned
higher
in
him
the
thin
fixed
smile
that
disfigured
her
lips
said
do
your
worst
do
all
you
can
nothing
will
save
you
he
did
not
draw
a
full
breath
till
they
were
far
out
on
the
schleussiger
weg
then
he
dropped
her
arm
and
wiped
his
face
the
road
was
heavy
with
mud
from
rains
of
the
preceding
day
louise
dragging
at
his
side
was
careless
of
it
and
let
her
long
skirt
trail
behind
her
he
called
her
attention
to
it
furiously
and
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
spoken
since
leaving
the
house
but
she
did
not
even
look
down
she
picked
out
a
part
of
the
road
that
was
still
dirtier
where
her
feet
sank
and
stuck
they
crossed
the
bridge
and
joined
the
on
one
of
the
first
seats
they
came
to
louise
sank
exhausted
filled
with
the
idea
of
getting
her
into
the
heart
of
the
woods
he
was
ahead
of
her
urging
the
pace
and
he
had
taken
a
further
step
or
two
before
he
saw
that
she
had
remained
behind
he
was
forced
to
return
what
are
you
sitting
there
for
he
turned
on
her
with
difficulty
resisting
the
impulse
to
strike
her
full
in
her
contemptuous
white
face
she
laughed
her
terrible
laugh
which
made
the
very
nerves
twitch
in
his
why
does
one
usually
sit
down
one
you
not
one
you
you
now
he
wished
hundreds
of
listeners
were
in
their
neighbourhood
that
the
fierceness
of
his
voice
might
carry
to
them
and
you
a
madman
yes
treat
me
like
the
dirt
under
your
feet
but
you
ca
deceive
do
you
think
i
do
know
why
you
stopping
here
she
looked
away
from
him
without
replying
do
you
think
i
do
know
why
you
decked
yourself
out
like
this
for
god
sake
stop
harping
on
my
dress
why
you
bedizened
yourself
why
you
were
going
out
why
you
spied
and
gaped
eternally
from
one
side
of
the
street
to
the
other
as
she
only
continued
to
look
away
the
desire
seized
him
to
say
something
so
incisive
that
the
implacability
of
her
face
would
have
to
change
no
matter
to
what
i
tell
you
then
he
shouted
and
struck
the
palm
of
one
hand
with
the
back
of
the
other
so
that
the
bones
in
both
bit
and
stung
i
tell
you
you
waiting
here
waiting
i
say
but
you
wait
to
no
purpose
for
you
reckoned
without
me
oh
very
well
then
if
it
pleases
you
i
waiting
but
you
can
at
least
say
for
what
for
you
perhaps
for
you
to
regain
your
senses
stop
your
damned
sneering
will
you
tell
me
you
do
know
who
do
know
he
here
still
she
continued
to
overlook
him
he
who
what
she
flung
the
little
words
at
him
like
stones
yet
in
the
second
that
elapsed
before
his
reply
a
faint
presentiment
widened
her
eyes
you
got
the
audacity
to
ask
that
flinging
himself
down
on
the
seat
he
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
stretched
out
his
legs
who
but
your
precious
schilsky
the
man
who
knew
how
you
ought
to
be
treated
who
gave
you
what
you
deserved
his
first
feeling
was
one
of
relief
the
truth
was
out
there
was
an
end
to
the
torture
of
the
past
hour
but
after
this
one
flash
of
sensation
he
ceased
to
consider
himself
at
his
words
louise
turned
so
white
that
he
thought
she
was
going
to
faint
she
raised
her
hand
to
her
throat
and
held
it
there
she
tried
to
say
something
and
could
not
utter
a
sound
her
voice
had
left
her
she
turned
her
head
and
looked
at
him
in
a
strange
apprehensive
way
with
the
eyes
of
a
trapped
animal
eugen
eugen
is
here
she
said
at
last
here
do
you
know
what
you
saying
now
that
her
voice
had
come
it
was
a
little
thin
whisper
like
the
voice
of
a
sick
person
she
pushed
hat
and
hair
both
suddenly
become
an
intolerable
weight
back
from
her
forehead
still
he
was
not
warned
will
you
swear
to
me
you
did
know
i
know
i
swear
her
voice
was
still
a
mere
echo
of
itself
but
now
she
rose
and
standing
at
the
end
of
the
seat
furthest
from
him
held
on
to
the
back
of
it
i
know
she
repeated
as
if
to
herself
then
she
drew
a
long
breath
which
quivered
through
her
and
with
it
voice
and
emotion
and
the
power
of
expression
returned
i
know
she
cried
with
a
startling
loudness
good
god
you
fool
do
you
think
i
be
here
with
you
if
i
had
known
if
i
had
known
a
foreboding
of
what
he
had
done
came
to
maurice
take
care
take
care
what
you
say
she
burst
into
a
peal
of
hysterical
laughter
which
echoed
through
the
woods
take
care
he
said
again
and
trembled
of
what
of
you
perhaps
you
i
may
kill
you
yet
oh
such
as
you
do
kill
she
lowered
her
veil
and
stooped
for
her
gloves
he
looked
up
at
her
swift
movement
there
was
a
blueness
round
his
lips
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
laughed
you
you
going
to
him
louise
you
are
not
going
to
him
oh
you
poor
crazy
fool
what
made
you
tell
me
stay
here
he
caught
her
by
the
sleeve
but
she
shook
his
hand
off
as
though
it
were
a
poisonous
insect
for
god
sake
think
what
doing
have
a
little
mercy
on
me
have
you
ever
had
mercy
on
me
she
took
a
few
quick
steps
away
from
the
seat
then
with
an
equally
impulsive
resolve
came
back
and
confronted
him
you
talk
to
me
of
mercy
you
when
nothing
i
could
wish
you
would
be
bad
enough
for
you
oh
i
never
thought
it
would
be
possible
to
hate
anyone
as
i
hate
you
you
despicable
dummy
of
a
man
why
could
you
have
let
me
alone
i
did
care
that
much
for
you
not
that
much
but
you
came
with
your
pretence
of
friendship
and
your
flattery
and
your
sympathy
it
was
all
lies
every
word
of
it
do
you
think
what
has
happened
to
us
would
ever
have
happened
if
you
been
a
different
kind
of
man
but
you
have
never
had
a
clean
thought
of
me
never
do
you
suppose
i
have
known
what
you
were
thinking
and
believing
about
me
in
these
last
weeks
those
nights
when
i
waited
night
after
night
to
see
a
light
come
back
in
his
windows
yes
and
i
let
you
believe
it
i
wanted
you
to
i
was
glad
you
did
glad
to
see
you
suffer
i
wish
you
were
dead
do
you
see
that
river
go
and
throw
yourself
into
it
i
stand
here
and
watch
you
sink
and
laugh
when
i
see
you
oh
i
hate
you
hate
you
i
shall
hate
you
to
my
last
hour
she
spat
on
the
ground
at
his
feet
before
he
could
raise
his
head
she
was
gone
he
made
an
involuntary
but
wholly
uncertain
movement
to
follow
her
did
not
however
carry
it
out
and
sank
back
into
his
former
attitude
his
cold
hands
were
deep
in
his
pockets
his
shoulders
drawn
up
and
his
face
drained
of
its
blood
was
like
the
face
of
an
old
man
he
had
made
no
attempt
to
defend
himself
had
sat
mute
letting
her
vindictive
words
go
over
him
inwardly
admitting
their
truth
now
he
closed
his
eyes
and
kept
them
shut
until
the
thudding
of
his
heart
grew
less
forcible
when
he
looked
up
again
his
gaze
met
the
muddy
sluggish
water
into
which
she
had
dared
him
to
throw
himself
but
he
did
not
even
recall
her
taunt
he
merely
sat
and
stared
at
the
river
amazed
at
the
way
in
which
it
had
as
it
were
detached
itself
from
other
objects
all
at
once
it
had
acquired
a
life
of
its
own
and
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
it
had
ever
been
an
integral
part
of
the
landscape
he
remained
sitting
till
the
mists
were
but
even
when
after
more
than
one
start
for
his
legs
were
stiff
and
numbed
he
rose
to
go
home
he
did
not
realise
what
had
happened
to
him
he
was
only
aware
that
night
had
fallen
and
that
it
would
be
better
to
get
back
in
the
direction
of
the
town
the
twinkling
did
more
than
anything
towards
rousing
him
but
they
also
made
him
long
with
a
sudden
vehemence
for
some
warm
brightly
lighted
interior
where
it
would
be
possible
to
forget
the
night
haunted
river
he
sought
out
an
obscure
cafe
and
entering
called
for
brandy
on
this
night
he
was
under
no
necessity
to
limit
himself
and
he
sat
glowering
at
the
table
and
emptying
his
glass
until
he
had
died
a
temporary
and
charitable
death
the
delicious
sensation
of
sipping
the
brandy
was
his
chief
remembrance
of
these
hours
but
also
like
incorporate
happenings
he
was
conscious
as
the
night
deepened
of
women
shrill
and
lively
voices
and
of
the
pressure
of
a
woman
arms
xiii
he
wakened
the
next
morning
to
strange
surroundings
half
opening
his
eyes
he
saw
a
strip
of
drab
besprinkled
with
crude
pink
roses
and
the
black
and
gilt
frame
of
an
oblong
mirror
he
shut
them
again
immediately
preferring
to
believe
that
he
was
still
dreaming
somewhere
in
the
back
of
his
head
a
machine
was
working
with
slow
steady
throbs
which
made
his
body
vibrate
as
a
screw
does
a
steamer
he
lay
enduring
it
and
trying
to
sleep
again
to
its
accompaniment
but
just
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
dozing
off
a
noise
in
the
room
startled
him
and
made
him
wide
awake
he
was
not
alone
something
had
fallen
to
the
floor
and
a
voice
exclaimed
impatiently
peering
through
his
lids
he
looked
out
beyond
the
will
which
had
first
chained
his
attention
his
eyes
fell
on
the
back
of
a
woman
who
was
sitting
in
front
of
one
of
the
windows
doing
her
hair
in
her
hand
she
held
a
pair
of
curlingtongs
and
before
her
on
the
of
the
sofa
a
was
propped
up
her
hair
was
thick
and
blond
she
wore
a
black
silk
chemise
which
had
slipped
low
on
her
plump
shoulders
a
shabby
striped
petticoat
was
bound
round
her
waist
and
her
naked
feet
were
thrust
into
felt
shoes
maurice
lay
still
in
order
that
she
should
not
suspect
his
being
awake
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
silence
then
he
was
forced
to
sneeze
and
at
the
sound
the
woman
muttered
something
and
came
to
the
side
of
the
bed
a
curl
was
imprisoned
between
the
blades
of
the
tongs
which
she
continued
to
hold
aloft
in
front
of
her
forehead
na
kleiner
had
your
sleep
out
she
asked
in
a
raucous
voice
as
maurice
did
not
reply
but
closed
his
eyes
again
blinded
by
the
sunshine
that
poured
into
the
room
she
laughed
and
made
a
sound
like
that
with
which
one
urges
on
a
horse
do
feel
up
to
much
this
morning
eh
herrje
kleiner
but
you
were
tight
and
at
some
remembrance
of
the
preceding
night
she
chuckled
to
herself
and
now
i
bet
you
you
feel
as
if
you
never
be
able
to
lift
your
head
again
just
wait
a
jiffy
i
get
you
something
that
revive
you
she
waddled
to
the
door
and
he
heard
her
call
johann
einen
schnaps
feet
shuffled
in
the
passage
she
handed
maurice
a
glass
of
brandy
there
you
are
that
pull
you
together
swallow
it
down
she
said
as
he
hesitated
you
feel
another
man
after
and
now
i
do
what
i
would
do
for
every
one
make
you
a
coffee
to
wash
down
the
nasty
physic
she
laughed
loudly
at
her
own
joke
and
laid
the
curlingtongs
aside
he
watched
her
move
about
the
room
in
search
of
and
beneath
the
drooping
black
chemise
her
loose
breasts
swayed
not
that
i
much
time
she
went
on
as
she
ground
the
coffee
gone
a
quarter
to
twelve
already
and
i
like
fresh
air
i
do
miss
a
minute
of
so
up
you
get
here
dowse
your
head
in
this
water
leaning
against
the
table
maurice
drank
the
cup
of
black
coffee
and
considered
his
companion
no
longer
young
she
was
as
coarsely
haggard
as
are
the
generality
of
women
of
her
class
scanned
by
cruel
daylight
and
while
she
could
never
have
been
numbered
among
the
handsome
ones
of
her
profession
there
was
yet
a
certain
kindliness
in
the
smallish
blue
eyes
and
in
her
jocose
manner
of
treating
him
she
too
eyed
him
as
he
drank
sag
mal
kleiner
will
you
come
again
she
broke
the
silence
what
your
name
he
asked
evasively
and
put
the
cup
down
on
the
table
oh
just
ask
for
luise
she
said
on
her
tongue
the
name
had
three
syllables
and
there
was
a
v
before
the
i
she
was
nettled
by
his
laugh
what
wrong
with
it
she
asked
geh
kleiner
sei
nett
wo
you
come
again
perhaps
well
ask
for
luise
if
you
do
that
enough
he
turned
to
put
on
his
coat
as
he
did
so
a
disagreeable
thought
crossed
his
mind
he
coloured
and
ran
his
hand
through
his
pockets
i
no
money
what
rooked
are
you
well
it
was
here
then
i
an
honest
girl
i
am
she
came
over
to
him
not
exactly
suspicious
still
with
a
slight
diminution
of
friendliness
in
eyes
and
tone
and
as
if
there
were
room
for
a
mistake
on
his
part
herself
went
through
the
likely
pockets
in
turn
not
a
heller
her
sharp
little
eyes
travelled
over
him
that
do
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
he
took
it
out
and
gave
it
to
her
she
stood
on
for
she
was
dumpy
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
gave
him
a
hearty
kiss
du
gefallst
mir
she
said
i
like
you
kiss
me
too
ca
you
he
looked
down
on
the
plump
ungainly
figure
and
without
feeling
either
satisfaction
or
repugnance
stooped
and
kissed
the
befringed
forehead
adieu
kleiner
come
again
adieu
luise
he
was
eyed
he
felt
it
from
various
rooms
the
doors
of
which
stood
ajar
the
front
door
was
wide
open
and
he
left
it
so
he
descended
the
stairs
with
a
sagging
step
down
he
stopped
short
he
had
spoken
the
truth
when
he
said
that
he
was
without
money
every
pfennig
he
possessed
had
been
in
his
pocket
the
night
before
under
these
circumstances
he
could
undertake
nothing
but
even
while
he
thought
it
his
hand
sought
his
watch
which
he
carried
chainless
in
a
pocket
of
his
vest
it
was
there
and
as
his
fingers
closed
on
it
he
proceeded
on
his
way
the
day
had
again
set
in
brilliantly
the
shadows
on
roads
and
pavements
had
real
depth
and
the
outlines
of
the
houses
were
hard
against
a
cloudless
sky
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
for
the
crudeness
of
the
light
made
them
ache
his
feet
bore
him
along
the
road
they
knew
better
than
any
other
and
until
he
had
been
in
the
bruderstrasse
he
could
not
decide
what
was
to
come
next
he
dragged
along
with
bowed
head
and
the
distance
seemed
unending
even
when
he
had
turned
the
corner
and
was
in
the
street
itself
he
kept
his
head
down
and
only
when
he
was
opposite
the
house
did
he
throw
a
quick
glance
upwards
his
heart
gave
a
terrifying
leap
then
ceased
to
beat
when
it
began
again
it
was
at
a
mad
gallop
which
prevented
him
drawing
breath
all
three
windows
stood
wide
open
the
white
hung
out
over
the
sills
and
flapped
languidly
in
the
breeze
he
crossed
the
road
with
small
steps
like
a
convalescent
he
pushed
back
the
heavy
and
entered
the
vestibule
which
was
cold
and
shadowy
step
by
step
he
climbed
to
the
first
landing
the
door
of
the
flat
was
shut
but
the
little
door
in
the
wall
stood
ajar
and
he
could
see
right
into
the
room
he
leaned
against
the
banisters
where
the
shadow
was
deepest
inside
the
room
that
had
been
his
world
two
charwomen
rubbed
and
scoured
talking
as
they
worked
in
strident
tones
the
heavy
furniture
had
been
pulled
into
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
shrouded
in
white
coverings
chairs
were
laid
on
the
bed
with
their
legs
in
the
air
there
was
no
trace
of
anything
that
had
belonged
to
louise
all
familiar
objects
had
vanished
it
was
a
strange
unnatural
scene
he
felt
as
one
might
feel
who
by
means
of
some
mysterious
agency
found
it
possible
to
be
present
at
his
own
burial
while
he
was
still
alive
one
of
the
women
began
to
beat
the
sofa
under
cover
of
the
blows
which
reverberated
through
the
house
he
slunk
away
but
he
did
not
get
far
when
he
was
recalled
to
himself
by
a
new
noise
in
one
of
the
upper
storeys
he
found
that
he
was
standing
on
the
bottom
step
of
the
stairs
holding
fast
to
the
round
gilt
ball
that
surmounted
the
last
post
of
the
banisters
he
moved
from
there
to
the
warmth
of
the
and
for
some
time
before
going
out
stood
sunning
himself
a
forlorn
figure
with
eyes
that
blinked
at
the
light
he
felt
very
cold
and
weak
to
the
point
of
faintness
this
sensation
reminded
him
that
he
had
had
no
solid
food
since
noon
the
day
before
his
first
business
was
obviously
to
eat
a
meal
fighting
a
growing
dizziness
he
trudged
into
the
town
and
having
pawned
his
watch
went
to
a
restaurant
and
forced
himself
to
swallow
the
meal
that
was
set
before
him
though
there
were
moments
when
it
seemed
incredible
that
it
was
actually
he
who
plied
knife
and
fork
he
would
have
been
glad
to
linger
for
a
time
after
eating
but
the
restaurant
was
crowded
and
the
waiter
openly
impatient
for
him
to
be
gone
as
he
rose
he
saw
the
man
flicking
the
crumbs
off
the
cloth
and
setting
the
table
anew
some
one
was
waiting
to
take
his
place
when
he
emerged
again
into
the
thronged
and
slightly
dusty
streets
his
previous
strong
impression
of
the
unreality
of
things
was
upon
him
again
now
however
it
seemed
as
though
some
submerged
consciousness
were
at
work
in
him
for
though
he
was
not
aware
of
having
reviewed
his
position
or
of
having
cast
a
plan
of
action
he
knew
at
once
what
was
to
be
done
and
as
before
his
feet
bore
him
without
bidding
where
he
had
to
go
he
retraced
his
steps
and
down
the
klostergasse
entered
a
gunsmith
shop
the
owner
an
elderly
man
in
a
velvet
cap
and
spectacles
looked
at
him
over
the
tops
of
these
then
said
curtly
he
could
not
oblige
him
what
was
more
he
came
out
after
him
and
standing
in
the
watched
him
go
down
the
street
at
his
refusal
maurice
had
hurriedly
withdrawn
now
as
he
went
he
troubled
by
the
fact
that
the
man
face
was
vaguely
familiar
to
him
for
the
length
of
a
he
endeavoured
to
recollect
where
he
had
seen
the
face
before
and
suddenly
he
knew
it
was
this
very
shop
he
had
once
been
in
to
inquire
after
krafft
and
this
was
the
same
man
who
had
then
been
so
uncivil
to
him
but
as
soon
as
he
remembered
the
knowledge
ceased
to
interest
him
rendered
cautious
by
his
first
experience
he
went
to
another
neighbourhood
and
having
sought
for
some
time
found
a
smaller
shop
in
a
side
street
he
had
ready
this
time
the
fiction
of
a
friend
and
a
commission
but
a
woman
regretted
wordily
that
her
husband
had
just
stepped
out
he
would
no
doubt
be
back
again
immediately
if
the
herr
would
take
a
chair
and
wait
a
little
but
the
thought
of
waiting
made
him
turn
on
his
heel
finally
at
his
third
attempt
a
young
lad
gave
him
what
he
desired
without
demur
and
after
he
had
known
a
quick
fear
lest
he
should
not
have
sufficient
money
for
the
purchase
the
matter
was
satisfactorily
settled
on
returning
to
his
room
he
found
a
letter
lying
on
the
table
he
pounced
upon
it
with
a
desperate
hope
but
it
was
only
the
monthly
bill
for
the
hire
of
the
piano
in
entering
he
had
made
some
noise
and
frau
krause
was
in
the
room
before
he
knew
it
she
was
primed
for
an
angry
scene
but
he
made
short
work
of
her
complaints
and
accusations
i
have
time
for
all
that
he
turned
the
key
in
the
door
and
sitting
down
before
the
commenced
to
go
through
drawers
and
pigeonholes
it
had
not
been
a
habit
of
his
to
keep
letters
but
nevertheless
a
certain
number
had
accumulated
and
these
he
was
averse
to
let
fall
into
the
hands
of
strangers
he
performed
his
work
coolly
with
a
pedantic
thoroughness
he
had
no
sympathy
with
those
people
who
doing
what
he
was
about
to
do
left
ragged
ends
behind
them
his
mind
had
always
inclined
to
law
and
order
and
so
having
written
a
note
authorising
frau
krause
to
keep
his
books
and
clothes
in
place
of
the
outstanding
rent
he
put
a
match
to
the
fire
which
was
laid
in
the
stove
and
on
his
knees
before
it
burnt
all
such
personal
trifles
as
had
value
for
himself
alone
he
postponed
to
the
last
even
handling
the
small
packet
made
up
of
the
letters
he
had
had
from
louise
then
their
turn
came
too
kneeling
before
the
stovedoor
he
dropped
them
one
by
one
into
the
flames
the
last
to
burn
was
the
first
he
had
received
a
mere
hastily
scrawled
line
a
twisted
note
which
opened
as
it
blackened
i
must
speak
to
you
will
you
come
to
me
this
evening
as
he
watched
it
shrivel
he
had
a
vivid
recollection
of
that
long
past
day
he
remembered
how
he
had
tried
to
shave
and
how
he
had
dressed
himself
in
his
best
only
to
fling
back
again
into
his
annoyed
with
himself
for
even
harbouring
the
thought
yes
but
that
had
always
been
his
way
he
had
expended
consideration
and
delicacy
where
none
was
necessary
he
had
seen
her
only
as
he
wished
to
see
after
this
the
photographs
they
were
harder
to
burn
he
was
forced
to
tear
them
across
in
two
three
pieces
even
then
the
flames
licked
slowly
he
watched
them
creep
up
over
her
dress
her
hands
her
face
afternoon
had
turned
to
evening
when
at
length
everything
was
in
order
he
lay
down
on
the
sofa
to
wait
for
it
to
grow
quite
dark
but
almost
at
once
as
if
his
back
had
been
eased
of
a
load
he
fell
asleep
when
he
opened
his
eyes
again
the
lamp
had
burned
low
and
filled
the
room
with
a
poisonous
vapour
it
was
two
this
was
the
time
to
go
but
a
boisterous
wind
had
risen
and
was
blustering
round
the
house
he
said
to
himself
that
he
would
wait
still
a
little
longer
to
see
if
it
did
not
subside
in
waiting
he
slept
again
heavily
as
he
had
not
done
for
many
a
night
and
when
he
wakened
next
a
clock
was
striking
four
he
rose
at
once
and
with
his
boots
in
his
hand
crept
out
of
the
house
day
was
breaking
as
he
walked
a
thin
streak
of
grey
in
the
east
widened
with
extreme
rapidity
and
became
a
bank
of
pale
grey
light
he
met
an
army
of
indistinguishably
male
and
female
returning
from
their
work
their
long
brooms
over
their
shoulders
it
had
rained
a
little
and
the
pavements
were
damp
and
shining
the
wind
had
dropped
to
a
mere
morning
breeze
which
met
him
at
before
his
mind
eye
rose
a
vision
of
the
coming
day
he
saw
one
of
those
early
spring
days
of
illimitable
blue
highness
and
white
woofy
clouds
which
stand
stationary
where
the
earth
meets
the
sky
the
brightness
of
the
sun
makes
the
roads
seem
whiter
and
the
grass
greener
bringing
out
new
tints
and
colours
in
everything
it
touches
over
it
all
would
run
this
light
swift
wind
bending
the
buds
and
even
towards
afternoon
throwing
up
a
fine
white
and
it
was
to
the
thought
of
the
dust
that
his
mind
clung
most
tenaciously
as
to
some
homely
and
familiar
thing
which
he
would
never
see
again
he
had
made
straight
for
the
seat
with
the
bosky
background
arrived
at
it
he
went
a
few
steps
aside
into
an
open
space
among
the
undergrowth
which
was
now
generously
sprinkled
with
buds
the
leaves
that
had
fallen
during
the
previous
autumn
made
a
carpet
under
his
feet
somewhere
in
the
distance
a
band
was
playing
a
body
of
soldiers
was
being
marched
out
to
exercise
he
opened
the
case
he
was
carrying
and
laid
it
on
the
seat
he
was
not
conscious
of
feeling
afraid
if
he
had
a
fear
it
was
only
lest
in
his
inexperience
he
should
do
what
he
had
to
do
clumsily
in
loosening
the
clothes
at
his
neck
however
he
perceived
that
his
hand
was
shaking
and
this
made
him
aware
that
his
heart
also
was
beating
unevenly
he
stood
and
fumbled
with
his
which
he
could
not
unfasten
at
once
and
while
he
was
busied
thus
the
mists
that
blinded
him
fell
away
he
ceased
abruptly
to
be
the
mere
automaton
that
had
moved
and
acted
without
will
of
its
own
for
the
past
hours
standing
there
with
his
fingers
at
his
neck
he
was
pierced
by
a
sudden
lucid
perception
of
what
had
happened
an
intolerable
spasm
of
remembrance
gripped
him
with
a
rush
of
bitterness
which
was
undiluted
agony
all
the
shame
and
suffering
of
the
past
months
swept
over
him
once
more
concentrated
in
a
last
supreme
moment
and
as
though
this
were
not
enough
while
he
still
wrenched
at
his
neck
tearing
his
in
his
desperation
her
face
rose
before
him
but
not
the
face
he
had
known
and
loved
he
saw
it
as
he
had
seen
it
for
the
last
time
disfigured
by
hatred
of
him
horribly
vindictive
as
it
had
been
when
she
spat
on
the
ground
at
his
feet
this
vision
gave
him
an
jerk
of
courage
without
allowing
himself
another
second
in
which
to
reason
or
reflect
he
caught
up
the
revolver
from
the
seat
and
pressed
the
cold
little
nozzle
to
his
chest
simultaneously
he
received
a
sharp
blow
and
heard
the
crack
of
a
report
but
far
away
in
the
distance
he
was
on
his
back
without
knowing
how
he
had
got
there
straight
overhead
waved
the
bare
branches
of
a
tree
behind
them
a
grey
morning
cloud
was
sailing
for
still
the
fraction
of
a
second
he
heard
the
familiar
melody
to
which
the
soldiers
marched
and
the
branch
swayed
swayed
then
as
suddenly
as
the
flame
of
a
candle
is
puffed
out
by
the
wind
his
life
went
from
him
his
right
hand
twitched
made
as
if
to
open
closed
again
and
stiffened
round
the
iron
of
the
handle
his
jaw
fell
and
like
an
inner
lid
a
glazed
film
rose
over
his
eyes
which
for
hours
afterwards
continued
to
stare
with
an
expression
of
horror
and
amaze
at
the
naked
branches
of
the
tree
one
midday
a
couple
of
years
later
a
number
of
those
who
had
formed
the
audience
at
one
of
the
last
rehearsals
of
the
season
were
gathered
round
the
back
entrance
to
the
gewandhaus
it
was
a
fresh
spring
day
gusty
and
sunny
by
turns
sometimes
there
came
a
puff
of
wind
that
drove
every
one
hand
to
his
hat
at
others
the
broad
square
basked
in
an
almost
motionless
sunshine
the
small
crowd
lingered
in
order
to
see
at
close
quarters
the
violinist
who
had
played
there
that
morning
only
a
few
of
those
present
had
known
schilsky
personally
but
one
and
all
were
curious
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
quondam
leipzig
student
who
it
was
whispered
would
soon
return
to
the
town
to
take
up
a
leading
position
in
the
orchestra
schilsky
was
now
konzertmeister
in
a
large
south
german
town
but
it
was
rather
as
a
composer
that
his
name
had
begun
to
burn
on
people
tongues
his
new
symphonic
poem
uber
die
letzten
dinge
had
drawn
down
on
his
head
that
mixture
of
extravagant
laudation
and
abusive
derision
which
constitutes
fame
take
a
look
at
his
wife
if
she
there
said
one
american
to
another
who
was
standing
beside
him
she
studied
here
same
time
he
did
and
is
said
to
have
been
very
handsome
an
english
chap
shot
himself
on
her
account
you
do
say
drawled
his
companion
it
a
queer
thing
how
common
suicide
getting
to
be
you
ca
pick
up
a
noospaper
nowadays
without
finding
some
fool
or
other
has
blown
his
brains
out
look
out
here
they
come
behind
the
thick
glass
doors
schilsky
became
visible
he
was
talking
volubly
to
a
stranger
in
a
coat
his
hat
was
pushed
far
back
on
his
forehead
his
face
was
flushed
with
elation
and
consciously
unconscious
of
the
waiting
crowd
he
gesticulated
as
he
walked
throwing
out
the
palms
of
his
loosely
dangling
hands
and
emphasising
his
words
with
restless
movements
of
the
head
he
was
respectfully
greeted
by
those
who
had
known
him
a
minute
or
two
later
came
louise
at
her
side
was
a
pianist
with
whom
schilsky
had
given
a
concert
earlier
in
the
week
a
shabbily
dressed
young
man
with
a
world
of
enthusiasm
in
his
candid
blue
eyes
he
too
was
talking
with
animation
but
louise
had
no
attention
for
anyone
but
her
husband
well
not
my
taste
i
must
confess
laughed
the
man
who
had
been
severe
on
suicide
fine
eyes
if
you
like
but
give
me
something
fresher
she
was
wearing
a
long
cloak
the
door
in
swinging
to
caught
an
end
of
this
and
hindered
her
progress
both
she
and
her
companion
stooped
to
free
it
their
hands
met
and
the
bystanders
saw
the
young
man
colour
darkly
over
face
and
neck
the
others
had
got
into
one
of
the
droschkes
that
waited
in
line
beside
the
building
the
dark
stranger
put
an
impatient
head
out
of
the
window
the
two
behind
quickened
their
steps
the
young
man
helped
louise
in
mounted
himself
and
slammed
the
door
the
driver
gathered
up
the
reins
cracked
his
whip
and
the
droschke
went
swerving
round
the
corner
clattering
gutturally
on
the
cobbled
stone
pavement
the
group
of
loiterers
at
the
door
dispersed
