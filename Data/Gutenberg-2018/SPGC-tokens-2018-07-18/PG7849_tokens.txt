chapter
one
arrest
conversation
with
grubach
then
miss
b√ºrstner
someone
must
have
been
telling
lies
about
josef
he
knew
he
had
done
nothing
wrong
but
one
morning
he
was
arrested
every
day
at
eight
in
the
morning
he
was
brought
his
breakfast
by
cook
grubach
was
his
landlady
but
today
she
did
come
that
had
never
happened
before
waited
a
little
while
looked
from
his
pillow
at
the
old
woman
who
lived
opposite
and
who
was
watching
him
with
an
inquisitiveness
quite
unusual
for
her
and
finally
both
hungry
and
disconcerted
rang
the
bell
there
was
immediately
a
knock
at
the
door
and
a
man
entered
he
had
never
seen
the
man
in
this
house
before
he
was
slim
but
firmly
built
his
clothes
were
black
and
with
many
folds
and
pockets
buckles
and
buttons
and
a
belt
all
of
which
gave
the
impression
of
being
very
practical
but
without
making
it
very
clear
what
they
were
actually
for
who
are
you
asked
sitting
half
upright
in
his
bed
the
man
however
ignored
the
question
as
if
his
arrival
simply
had
to
be
accepted
and
merely
replied
you
rang
anna
should
have
brought
me
my
breakfast
said
he
tried
to
work
out
who
the
man
actually
was
first
in
silence
just
through
observation
and
by
thinking
about
it
but
the
man
did
stay
still
to
be
looked
at
for
very
long
instead
he
went
over
to
the
door
opened
it
slightly
and
said
to
someone
who
was
clearly
standing
immediately
behind
it
he
wants
anna
to
bring
him
his
breakfast
there
was
a
little
laughter
in
the
neighbouring
room
it
was
not
clear
from
the
sound
of
it
whether
there
were
several
people
laughing
the
strange
man
could
not
have
learned
anything
from
it
that
he
had
known
already
but
now
he
said
to
as
if
making
his
report
it
is
not
possible
it
would
be
the
first
time
that
happened
said
as
he
jumped
out
of
bed
and
quickly
pulled
on
his
trousers
i
want
to
see
who
that
is
in
the
next
room
and
why
it
is
that
grubach
has
let
me
be
disturbed
in
this
way
it
immediately
occurred
to
him
that
he
have
said
this
out
loud
and
that
he
must
to
some
extent
have
acknowledged
their
authority
by
doing
so
but
that
did
seem
important
to
him
at
the
time
that
at
least
is
how
the
stranger
took
it
as
he
said
do
you
think
you
better
stay
where
you
are
i
want
neither
to
stay
here
nor
to
be
spoken
to
by
you
until
you
introduced
yourself
i
meant
it
for
your
own
good
said
the
stranger
and
opened
the
door
this
time
without
being
asked
the
next
room
which
entered
more
slowly
than
he
had
intended
looked
at
first
glance
exactly
the
same
as
it
had
the
previous
evening
it
was
grubach
living
room
with
furniture
tablecloths
porcelain
and
photographs
perhaps
there
was
a
little
more
space
in
there
than
usual
today
but
if
so
it
was
not
immediately
obvious
especially
as
the
main
difference
was
the
presence
of
a
man
sitting
by
the
open
window
with
a
book
from
which
he
now
looked
up
you
should
have
stayed
in
your
room
did
franz
tell
you
and
what
is
it
you
want
then
said
looking
back
and
forth
between
this
new
acquaintance
and
the
one
named
franz
who
had
remained
in
the
doorway
through
the
open
window
he
noticed
the
old
woman
again
who
had
come
close
to
the
window
opposite
so
that
she
could
continue
to
see
everything
she
was
showing
an
inquisitiveness
that
really
made
it
seem
like
she
was
going
senile
i
want
to
see
grubach
said
making
a
movement
as
if
tearing
himself
away
from
the
two
men
even
though
they
were
standing
well
away
from
him
and
wanted
to
go
no
said
the
man
at
the
window
who
threw
his
book
down
on
a
coffee
table
and
stood
up
you
ca
go
away
when
you
under
arrest
that
how
it
seems
said
and
why
am
i
under
arrest
he
then
asked
that
something
we
not
allowed
to
tell
you
go
into
your
room
and
wait
there
proceedings
are
underway
and
you
learn
about
everything
all
in
good
time
it
not
really
part
of
my
job
to
be
friendly
towards
you
like
this
but
i
hope
apart
from
franz
will
hear
about
it
and
he
been
more
friendly
towards
you
than
he
should
have
been
under
the
rules
himself
if
you
carry
on
having
as
much
good
luck
as
you
have
been
with
your
arresting
officers
then
you
can
reckon
on
things
going
well
with
you
wanted
to
sit
down
but
then
he
saw
that
apart
from
the
chair
by
the
window
there
was
nowhere
anywhere
in
the
room
where
he
could
sit
you
get
the
chance
to
see
for
yourself
how
true
all
this
is
said
franz
and
both
men
then
walked
up
to
they
were
significantly
bigger
than
him
especially
the
second
man
who
frequently
slapped
him
on
the
shoulder
the
two
of
them
felt
nightshirt
and
said
he
would
now
have
to
wear
one
that
was
of
much
lower
quality
but
that
they
would
keep
the
nightshirt
along
with
his
other
underclothes
and
return
them
to
him
if
his
case
turned
out
well
it
better
for
you
if
you
give
us
the
things
than
if
you
leave
them
in
the
storeroom
they
said
things
have
a
tendency
to
go
missing
in
the
storeroom
and
after
a
certain
amount
of
time
they
sell
things
off
whether
the
case
involved
has
come
to
an
end
or
not
and
cases
like
this
can
last
a
long
time
especially
the
ones
that
have
been
coming
up
lately
they
give
you
the
money
they
got
for
them
but
it
would
be
very
much
as
it
not
what
offered
for
them
when
they
sell
them
that
counts
it
how
much
they
get
slipped
on
the
side
and
things
like
that
lose
their
value
anyway
when
they
get
passed
on
from
hand
to
hand
year
after
year
paid
hardly
any
attention
to
what
they
were
saying
he
did
not
place
much
value
on
what
he
may
have
still
possessed
or
on
who
decided
what
happened
to
them
it
was
much
more
important
to
him
to
get
a
clear
understanding
of
his
position
but
he
could
not
think
clearly
while
these
people
were
here
the
second
policeman
belly
and
they
could
only
be
policemen
looked
friendly
enough
sticking
out
towards
him
but
when
looked
up
and
saw
his
dry
boney
face
it
did
not
seem
to
fit
with
the
body
his
strong
nose
twisted
to
one
side
as
if
ignoring
and
sharing
an
understanding
with
the
other
policeman
what
sort
of
people
were
these
what
were
they
talking
about
what
office
did
they
belong
to
was
living
in
a
free
country
after
all
everywhere
was
at
peace
all
laws
were
decent
and
were
upheld
who
was
it
who
dared
accost
him
in
his
own
home
he
was
always
inclined
to
take
life
as
lightly
as
he
could
to
cross
bridges
when
he
came
to
them
pay
no
heed
for
the
future
even
when
everything
seemed
under
threat
but
here
that
did
not
seem
the
right
thing
to
do
he
could
have
taken
it
all
as
a
joke
a
big
joke
set
up
by
his
colleagues
at
the
bank
for
some
unknown
reason
or
also
perhaps
because
today
was
his
thirtieth
birthday
it
was
all
possible
of
course
maybe
all
he
had
to
do
was
laugh
in
the
policemen
face
in
some
way
and
they
would
laugh
with
him
maybe
they
were
tradesmen
from
the
corner
of
the
street
they
looked
like
they
might
be
but
he
was
nonetheless
determined
ever
since
he
first
caught
sight
of
the
one
called
franz
not
to
lose
any
slight
advantage
he
might
have
had
over
these
people
there
was
a
very
slight
risk
that
people
would
later
say
he
could
understand
a
joke
but
although
he
was
normally
in
the
habit
of
learning
from
experience
he
might
also
have
had
a
few
unimportant
occasions
in
mind
when
unlike
his
more
cautious
friends
he
had
acted
with
no
thought
at
all
for
what
might
follow
and
had
been
made
to
suffer
for
it
he
did
want
that
to
happen
again
not
this
time
at
least
if
they
were
he
would
act
along
with
them
he
still
had
time
allow
me
he
said
and
hurried
between
the
two
policemen
through
into
his
room
he
seems
sensible
enough
he
heard
them
say
behind
him
once
in
his
room
he
quickly
pulled
open
the
drawer
of
his
writing
desk
everything
in
it
was
very
tidy
but
in
his
agitation
he
was
unable
to
find
the
identification
documents
he
was
looking
for
straight
away
he
finally
found
his
bicycle
permit
and
was
about
to
go
back
to
the
policemen
with
it
when
it
seemed
to
him
too
petty
so
he
carried
on
searching
until
he
found
his
birth
certificate
just
as
he
got
back
in
the
adjoining
room
the
door
on
the
other
side
opened
and
grubach
was
about
to
enter
he
only
saw
her
for
an
instant
for
as
soon
as
she
recognised
she
was
clearly
embarrassed
asked
for
forgiveness
and
disappeared
closing
the
door
behind
her
very
carefully
do
come
in
could
have
said
just
then
but
now
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
his
papers
in
his
hand
and
still
looking
at
the
door
which
did
not
open
again
he
stayed
like
that
until
he
was
startled
out
of
it
by
the
shout
of
the
policeman
who
sat
at
the
little
table
at
the
open
window
and
as
now
saw
was
eating
his
breakfast
why
did
she
come
in
he
asked
she
not
allowed
to
said
the
big
policeman
you
under
arrest
are
you
but
how
can
i
be
under
arrest
and
how
come
it
like
this
now
you
starting
again
said
the
policeman
dipping
a
piece
of
buttered
bread
in
the
honeypot
we
do
answer
questions
like
that
you
will
have
to
answer
them
said
here
are
my
identification
papers
now
show
me
yours
and
i
certainly
want
to
see
the
arrest
warrant
oh
my
god
said
the
policeman
in
a
position
like
yours
and
you
think
you
can
start
giving
orders
do
you
it
wo
do
you
any
good
to
get
us
on
the
wrong
side
even
if
you
think
it
will
we
probably
more
on
your
side
that
anyone
else
you
know
that
true
you
know
you
better
believe
it
said
franz
holding
a
cup
of
coffee
in
his
hand
which
he
did
not
lift
to
his
mouth
but
looked
at
in
a
way
that
was
probably
meant
to
be
full
of
meaning
but
could
not
actually
be
understood
found
himself
without
intending
it
in
a
mute
dialogue
with
franz
but
then
slapped
his
hand
down
on
his
papers
and
said
here
are
my
identity
documents
and
what
do
you
want
us
to
do
about
it
replied
the
big
policeman
loudly
the
way
you
carrying
on
it
worse
than
a
child
what
is
it
you
want
do
you
want
to
get
this
great
bloody
trial
of
yours
over
with
quickly
by
talking
about
id
and
arrest
warrants
with
us
we
just
coppers
that
all
we
are
junior
officers
like
us
hardly
know
one
end
of
an
id
card
from
another
all
we
got
to
do
with
you
is
keep
an
eye
on
you
for
ten
hours
a
day
and
get
paid
for
it
that
all
we
are
mind
you
what
we
can
do
is
make
sure
that
the
high
officials
we
work
for
find
out
just
what
sort
of
person
it
is
going
to
arrest
and
why
he
should
be
arrested
before
they
issue
the
warrant
there
no
mistake
there
our
authorities
as
far
as
i
know
and
i
only
know
the
lowest
grades
do
go
out
looking
for
guilt
among
the
public
it
the
guilt
that
draws
them
out
like
it
says
in
the
law
and
they
have
to
send
us
police
officers
out
that
the
law
where
think
there
be
any
mistake
there
i
do
know
this
law
said
so
much
the
worse
for
you
then
said
the
policeman
probably
exists
only
in
your
heads
said
he
wanted
in
some
way
to
insinuate
his
way
into
the
thoughts
of
the
policemen
to
those
thoughts
to
his
benefit
or
to
make
himself
at
home
there
but
the
policeman
just
said
dismissively
you
find
out
when
it
affects
you
franz
joined
in
and
said
look
at
this
willem
he
admits
he
know
the
law
and
at
the
same
time
insists
he
innocent
you
quite
right
but
we
ca
get
him
to
understand
a
thing
said
the
other
stopped
talking
with
them
do
i
he
thought
to
himself
do
i
really
have
to
carry
on
getting
tangled
up
with
the
chattering
of
base
functionaries
like
this
and
they
admit
themselves
that
they
are
of
the
lowest
position
they
talking
about
things
of
which
they
do
have
the
slightest
understanding
anyway
it
only
because
of
their
stupidity
that
they
able
to
be
so
sure
of
themselves
i
just
need
few
words
with
someone
of
the
same
social
standing
as
myself
and
everything
will
be
incomparably
clearer
much
clearer
than
a
long
conversation
with
these
two
can
make
it
he
walked
up
and
down
the
free
space
in
the
room
a
couple
of
times
across
the
street
he
could
see
the
old
woman
who
now
had
pulled
an
old
man
much
older
than
herself
up
to
the
window
and
had
her
arms
around
him
had
to
put
an
end
to
this
display
take
me
to
your
superior
he
said
as
soon
as
he
wants
to
see
you
not
before
said
the
policeman
the
one
called
willem
and
now
my
advice
to
you
he
added
is
to
go
into
your
room
stay
calm
and
wait
and
see
what
to
be
done
with
you
if
you
take
our
advice
you
tire
yourself
out
thinking
about
things
to
no
purpose
you
need
to
pull
yourself
together
as
there
a
lot
that
going
to
required
of
you
you
not
behaved
towards
us
the
way
we
deserve
after
being
so
good
to
you
you
forget
that
we
whatever
we
are
we
still
free
men
and
you
not
and
that
quite
an
advantage
but
in
spite
of
all
that
we
still
willing
if
you
got
the
money
to
go
and
get
you
some
breakfast
from
the
caf√©
over
the
road
without
giving
any
answer
to
this
offer
stood
still
for
some
time
perhaps
if
he
opened
the
door
of
the
next
room
or
even
the
front
door
the
two
of
them
would
not
dare
to
stand
in
his
way
perhaps
that
would
be
the
simplest
way
to
settle
the
whole
thing
by
bringing
it
to
a
head
but
maybe
they
would
grab
him
and
if
he
were
thrown
down
on
the
ground
he
would
lose
all
the
advantage
he
in
a
certain
respect
had
over
them
so
he
decided
on
the
more
certain
solution
the
way
things
would
go
in
the
natural
course
of
events
and
went
back
in
his
room
without
another
word
either
from
him
or
from
the
policemen
he
threw
himself
down
on
his
bed
and
from
the
dressing
table
he
took
the
nice
apple
that
he
had
put
there
the
previous
evening
for
his
breakfast
now
it
was
all
the
breakfast
he
had
and
anyway
as
he
confirmed
as
soon
as
he
took
his
first
big
bite
of
it
it
was
far
better
than
a
breakfast
he
could
have
had
through
the
good
will
of
the
policemen
from
the
dirty
caf√©
he
felt
well
and
confident
he
had
failed
to
go
into
work
at
the
bank
this
morning
but
that
could
easily
be
excused
because
of
the
relatively
high
position
he
held
there
should
he
really
send
in
his
explanation
he
wondered
about
it
if
nobody
believed
him
and
in
this
case
that
would
be
understandable
he
could
bring
grubach
in
as
a
witness
or
even
the
old
pair
from
across
the
street
who
probably
even
now
were
on
their
way
over
to
the
window
opposite
it
puzzled
at
least
it
puzzled
him
looking
at
it
from
the
policemen
point
of
view
that
they
had
made
him
go
into
the
room
and
left
him
alone
there
where
he
had
ten
different
ways
of
killing
himself
at
the
same
time
though
he
asked
himself
this
time
looking
at
it
from
his
own
point
of
view
what
reason
he
could
have
to
do
so
because
those
two
were
sitting
there
in
the
next
room
and
had
taken
his
breakfast
perhaps
it
would
have
been
so
pointless
to
kill
himself
that
even
if
he
had
wanted
to
the
pointlessness
would
have
made
him
unable
maybe
if
the
policemen
had
not
been
so
obviously
limited
in
their
mental
abilities
it
could
have
been
supposed
that
they
had
come
to
the
same
conclusion
and
saw
no
danger
in
leaving
him
alone
because
of
it
they
could
watch
now
if
they
wanted
and
see
how
he
went
over
to
the
cupboard
in
the
wall
where
he
kept
a
bottle
of
good
schnapps
how
he
first
emptied
a
glass
of
it
in
place
of
his
breakfast
and
how
he
then
took
a
second
glassful
in
order
to
give
himself
courage
the
last
one
just
as
a
precaution
for
the
unlikely
chance
it
would
be
needed
then
he
was
so
startled
by
a
shout
to
him
from
the
other
room
that
he
struck
his
teeth
against
the
glass
the
supervisor
wants
to
see
you
a
voice
said
it
was
only
the
shout
that
startled
him
this
curt
abrupt
military
shout
that
he
would
not
have
expected
from
the
policeman
called
franz
in
itself
he
found
the
order
very
welcome
at
last
he
called
back
locked
the
cupboard
and
without
delay
hurried
into
the
next
room
the
two
policemen
were
standing
there
and
chased
him
back
into
his
bedroom
as
if
that
were
a
matter
of
course
what
think
you
doing
they
cried
think
you
going
to
see
the
supervisor
dressed
in
just
your
shirt
do
you
he
see
to
it
you
got
a
right
thumping
and
us
and
all
let
go
of
me
for
god
sake
called
who
had
already
been
pushed
back
as
far
as
his
wardrobe
if
you
accost
me
when
i
still
in
bed
you
ca
expect
to
find
me
in
my
evening
dress
that
wo
help
you
said
the
policemen
who
always
became
very
quiet
almost
sad
when
began
to
shout
and
in
that
way
confused
him
or
to
some
extent
brought
him
to
his
senses
ridiculous
formalities
he
grumbled
as
he
lifted
his
coat
from
the
chair
and
kept
it
in
both
his
hands
for
a
little
while
as
if
holding
it
out
for
the
policemen
inspection
they
shook
their
heads
it
got
to
be
a
black
coat
they
said
at
that
threw
the
coat
to
the
floor
and
said
without
knowing
even
himself
what
he
meant
by
it
well
it
not
going
to
be
the
main
trial
after
all
the
policemen
laughed
but
continued
to
insist
it
got
to
be
a
black
coat
well
alright
by
me
if
it
makes
things
go
any
faster
said
he
opened
the
wardrobe
himself
spent
a
long
time
searching
through
all
the
clothes
and
chose
his
best
black
suit
which
had
a
short
jacket
that
had
greatly
surprised
those
who
knew
him
then
he
also
pulled
out
a
fresh
shirt
and
began
carefully
to
get
dressed
he
secretly
told
himself
that
he
had
succeeded
in
speeding
things
up
by
letting
the
policemen
forget
to
make
him
have
a
bath
he
watched
them
to
see
if
they
might
remember
after
all
but
of
course
it
never
occurred
to
them
although
willem
did
not
forget
to
send
franz
up
to
the
supervisor
with
the
message
saying
that
was
getting
dressed
once
he
was
properly
dressed
had
to
pass
by
willem
as
he
went
through
the
next
room
into
the
one
beyond
the
door
of
which
was
already
wide
open
knew
very
well
that
this
room
had
recently
been
let
to
a
typist
called
b√ºrstner
she
was
in
the
habit
of
going
out
to
work
very
early
and
coming
back
home
very
late
and
had
never
exchanged
more
than
a
few
words
of
greeting
with
her
now
her
bedside
table
had
been
pulled
into
the
middle
of
the
room
to
be
used
as
a
desk
for
these
proceedings
and
the
supervisor
sat
behind
it
he
had
his
legs
crossed
and
had
thrown
one
arm
over
the
backrest
of
the
chair
in
one
corner
of
the
room
there
were
three
young
people
looking
at
the
photographs
belonging
to
miss
b√ºrstner
that
had
been
put
into
a
piece
of
fabric
on
the
wall
hung
up
on
the
handle
of
the
open
window
was
a
white
blouse
at
the
window
across
the
street
there
was
the
old
pair
again
although
now
their
number
had
increased
as
behind
them
and
far
taller
than
they
were
stood
a
man
with
an
open
shirt
that
showed
his
chest
and
a
reddish
goatee
beard
which
he
squeezed
and
twisted
with
his
fingers
josef
asked
the
supervisor
perhaps
merely
to
attract
attention
as
he
looked
round
the
room
nodded
i
daresay
you
were
quite
surprised
by
all
that
been
taking
place
this
morning
said
the
supervisor
as
with
both
hands
he
pushed
away
the
few
items
on
the
bedside
table
the
candle
and
box
of
matches
a
book
and
a
pin
cushion
which
lay
there
as
if
they
were
things
he
would
need
for
his
own
business
certainly
said
and
he
began
to
feel
relaxed
now
that
at
last
he
stood
in
front
of
someone
with
some
sense
someone
with
whom
he
would
be
able
to
talk
about
his
situation
certainly
i
surprised
but
i
not
in
any
way
very
surprised
you
not
very
surprised
asked
the
supervisor
as
he
positioned
the
candle
in
the
middle
of
the
table
and
the
other
things
in
a
group
around
it
perhaps
you
do
quite
understand
me
hurriedly
pointed
out
what
i
mean
is
here
broke
off
what
he
was
saying
and
looked
round
for
somewhere
to
sit
i
may
sit
down
may
i
he
asked
that
not
usual
the
supervisor
answered
what
i
mean
is
said
without
delaying
a
second
time
that
yes
i
am
very
surprised
but
when
you
been
in
the
world
for
thirty
years
already
and
had
to
make
your
own
way
through
everything
yourself
which
has
been
my
lot
then
you
become
hardened
to
surprises
and
do
take
them
too
hard
especially
not
what
happened
today
why
especially
not
happened
today
i
would
want
to
say
that
i
see
all
of
this
as
a
joke
you
seem
to
have
gone
to
too
much
trouble
making
all
these
arrangements
for
that
everyone
in
the
house
must
be
taking
part
in
it
as
well
as
all
of
you
that
would
be
going
beyond
what
could
be
a
joke
so
i
do
want
to
say
that
this
is
a
joke
quite
right
said
the
supervisor
looking
to
see
how
many
matches
were
left
in
the
box
but
on
the
other
hand
went
on
looking
round
at
everyone
there
and
even
wishing
he
could
get
the
attention
of
the
three
who
were
looking
at
the
photographs
on
the
other
hand
this
really
ca
be
all
that
important
that
follows
from
the
fact
that
i
been
indicted
but
ca
think
of
the
slightest
offence
for
which
i
could
be
indicted
but
even
that
is
all
beside
the
point
the
main
question
is
who
is
issuing
the
indictment
what
office
is
conducting
this
affair
are
you
officials
none
of
you
is
wearing
a
uniform
unless
what
you
are
wearing
here
he
turned
towards
franz
is
meant
to
be
a
uniform
it
actually
more
of
a
travelling
suit
i
require
a
clear
answer
to
all
these
questions
and
i
quite
sure
that
once
things
have
been
made
clear
we
can
take
our
leave
of
each
other
on
the
best
of
terms
the
supervisor
slammed
the
box
of
matches
down
on
the
table
you
making
a
big
mistake
he
said
these
gentlemen
and
i
have
got
nothing
to
do
with
your
business
in
fact
we
know
almost
nothing
about
you
we
could
be
wearing
uniforms
as
proper
and
exact
as
you
like
and
your
situation
would
be
any
the
worse
for
it
as
to
whether
you
on
a
charge
i
ca
give
you
any
sort
of
clear
answer
to
that
i
do
even
know
whether
you
are
or
not
you
under
arrest
you
quite
right
about
that
but
i
do
know
any
more
than
that
maybe
these
officers
have
been
with
you
well
if
they
have
that
all
it
is
chat
i
ca
give
you
an
answer
to
your
questions
but
i
can
give
you
a
bit
of
advice
you
better
think
less
about
us
and
what
going
to
happen
to
you
and
think
a
bit
more
about
yourself
and
stop
making
all
this
fuss
about
your
sense
of
innocence
you
do
make
such
a
bad
impression
but
with
all
this
fuss
you
damaging
it
and
you
ought
to
do
a
bit
less
talking
too
almost
everything
you
said
so
far
has
been
things
we
could
have
taken
from
your
behaviour
even
if
you
said
no
more
than
a
few
words
and
what
you
have
said
has
not
exactly
been
in
your
favour
stared
at
the
supervisor
was
this
man
probably
younger
than
he
was
lecturing
him
like
a
schoolmaster
was
he
being
punished
for
his
honesty
with
a
telling
off
and
was
he
to
learn
nothing
about
the
reasons
for
his
arrest
or
those
who
were
arresting
him
he
became
somewhat
cross
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
stopped
him
doing
this
and
he
pushed
his
sleeves
back
felt
his
chest
straightened
his
hair
went
over
to
the
three
men
said
it
makes
no
sense
at
which
these
three
turned
round
to
face
him
and
came
towards
him
with
serious
expressions
he
finally
came
again
to
a
halt
in
front
of
the
supervisor
desk
state
attorney
hasterer
is
a
good
friend
of
mine
he
said
can
i
telephone
him
certainly
said
the
supervisor
but
i
do
know
what
the
point
of
that
will
be
i
suppose
you
must
have
some
private
matter
you
want
to
discuss
with
him
what
the
point
is
shouted
more
disconcerted
that
cross
who
do
you
think
you
are
you
want
to
see
some
point
in
it
while
you
carrying
out
something
as
pointless
as
it
could
be
it
enough
to
make
you
cry
these
gentlemen
first
accost
me
and
now
they
sit
or
stand
about
in
here
and
let
me
be
hauled
up
in
front
of
you
what
point
there
would
be
in
telephoning
a
state
attorney
when
i
ostensibly
under
arrest
very
well
i
make
the
telephone
call
you
can
call
him
if
you
want
to
said
the
supervisor
stretching
his
hand
out
towards
the
outer
room
where
the
telephone
was
please
go
on
do
make
your
phone
call
no
i
want
to
any
more
said
and
went
over
to
the
window
across
the
street
the
people
were
still
there
at
the
window
and
it
was
only
now
that
had
gone
up
to
his
window
that
they
seemed
to
become
uneasy
about
quietly
watching
what
was
going
on
the
old
couple
wanted
to
get
up
but
the
man
behind
them
calmed
them
down
we
got
some
kind
of
audience
over
there
called
to
the
supervisor
quite
loudly
as
he
pointed
out
with
his
forefinger
go
away
he
then
called
across
to
them
and
the
three
of
them
did
immediately
retreat
a
few
steps
the
old
pair
even
found
themselves
behind
the
man
who
then
concealed
them
with
the
breadth
of
his
body
and
seemed
going
by
the
movements
of
his
mouth
to
be
saying
something
incomprehensible
into
the
distance
they
did
not
disappear
entirely
though
but
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
the
moment
when
they
could
come
back
to
the
window
without
being
noticed
intrusive
thoughtless
people
said
as
he
turned
back
into
the
room
the
supervisor
may
have
agreed
with
him
at
least
thought
that
was
what
he
saw
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
but
it
was
just
as
possible
that
he
had
not
even
been
listening
as
he
had
his
hand
pressed
firmly
down
on
the
table
and
seemed
to
be
comparing
the
length
of
his
fingers
the
two
policemen
were
sitting
on
a
chest
covered
with
a
coloured
blanket
rubbing
their
knees
the
three
young
people
had
put
their
hands
on
their
hips
and
were
looking
round
aimlessly
everything
was
still
like
in
some
office
that
has
been
forgotten
about
now
gentlemen
called
out
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
he
was
carrying
all
of
them
on
his
shoulders
it
looks
like
your
business
with
me
is
over
with
in
my
opinion
it
best
now
to
stop
wondering
about
whether
you
proceeding
correctly
or
incorrectly
and
to
bring
the
matter
to
a
peaceful
close
with
a
mutual
handshake
if
you
are
of
the
same
opinion
then
please
and
he
walked
up
to
the
supervisor
desk
and
held
out
his
hand
to
him
the
supervisor
raised
his
eyes
bit
his
lip
and
looked
at
outstretched
hand
k
still
believed
the
supervisor
would
do
as
he
suggested
but
instead
he
stood
up
picked
up
a
hard
round
hat
that
was
laying
on
miss
b√ºrstner
bed
and
put
it
carefully
onto
his
head
using
both
hands
as
if
trying
on
a
new
hat
everything
seems
so
simple
to
you
does
it
he
said
to
as
he
did
so
so
you
think
we
should
bring
the
matter
to
a
peaceful
close
do
you
no
no
that
wo
do
mind
you
on
the
other
hand
i
certainly
would
want
you
to
think
there
no
hope
for
you
no
why
should
you
think
that
you
simply
under
arrest
nothing
more
than
that
what
i
had
to
tell
you
that
what
i
done
and
now
i
seen
how
you
taken
it
that
enough
for
one
day
and
we
can
take
our
leave
of
each
other
for
the
time
being
at
least
i
expect
you
want
to
go
in
to
the
bank
now
wo
you
in
to
the
bank
asked
i
thought
i
was
under
arrest
said
this
with
a
certain
amount
of
defiance
as
although
his
handshake
had
not
been
accepted
he
was
feeling
more
independent
of
all
these
people
especially
since
the
supervisor
had
stood
up
he
was
playing
with
them
if
they
left
he
had
decided
he
would
run
after
them
and
offer
to
let
them
arrest
him
that
why
he
even
repeated
how
can
i
go
in
to
the
bank
when
i
under
arrest
i
see
you
misunderstood
me
said
the
supervisor
who
was
already
at
the
door
it
true
that
you
under
arrest
but
that
should
stop
you
from
carrying
out
your
job
and
there
should
be
anything
to
stop
you
carrying
on
with
your
usual
life
in
that
case
it
not
too
bad
being
under
arrest
said
and
went
up
close
to
the
supervisor
i
never
meant
it
should
be
anything
else
he
replied
it
hardly
seems
to
have
been
necessary
to
notify
me
of
the
arrest
in
that
case
said
and
went
even
closer
the
others
had
also
come
closer
all
of
them
had
gathered
together
into
a
narrow
space
by
the
door
that
was
my
duty
said
the
supervisor
a
silly
duty
said
unyielding
maybe
so
replied
the
supervisor
only
do
let
waste
our
time
talking
on
like
this
i
had
assumed
you
be
wanting
to
go
to
the
bank
as
paying
close
attention
to
every
word
i
add
this
i
not
forcing
you
to
go
to
the
bank
i
just
assumed
you
wanted
to
and
to
make
things
easier
for
you
and
to
let
you
get
to
the
bank
with
as
little
fuss
as
possible
i
put
these
three
gentlemen
colleagues
of
yours
at
your
disposal
what
that
exclaimed
and
looked
at
the
three
in
astonishment
he
could
only
remember
seeing
them
in
their
group
by
the
photographs
but
these
characterless
anaemic
young
people
were
indeed
officials
from
his
bank
not
colleagues
of
his
that
was
putting
it
too
high
and
it
showed
a
gap
in
the
omniscience
of
the
supervisor
but
they
were
nonetheless
junior
members
of
staff
at
the
bank
how
could
have
failed
to
see
that
how
occupied
he
must
have
been
with
the
supervisor
and
the
policemen
not
to
have
recognised
these
three
rabensteiner
with
his
stiff
demeanour
and
swinging
hands
kullich
with
his
blonde
hair
and
eyes
and
kaminer
with
his
involuntary
grin
caused
by
chronic
muscle
spasms
good
morning
said
after
a
while
extending
his
hand
to
the
gentlemen
as
they
bowed
correctly
to
him
i
recognise
you
at
all
so
we
go
into
work
now
shall
we
the
gentlemen
laughed
and
nodded
enthusiastically
as
if
that
was
what
they
had
been
waiting
for
all
the
time
except
that
had
left
his
hat
in
his
room
so
they
all
dashed
one
after
another
into
the
room
to
fetch
it
which
caused
a
certain
amount
of
embarrassment
stood
where
he
was
and
watched
them
through
the
open
double
doorway
the
last
to
go
of
course
was
the
apathetic
rabensteiner
who
had
broken
into
no
more
than
an
elegant
trot
kaminer
got
to
the
hat
and
as
he
often
had
to
do
at
the
bank
forcibly
reminded
himself
that
the
grin
was
not
deliberate
that
he
in
fact
was
able
to
grin
deliberately
at
that
moment
grubach
opened
the
door
from
the
hallway
into
the
living
room
where
all
the
people
were
she
did
not
seem
to
feel
guilty
about
anything
at
all
and
as
often
before
looked
down
at
the
belt
of
her
apron
which
for
no
reason
cut
so
deeply
into
her
hefty
body
once
downstairs
with
his
watch
in
his
hand
decided
to
take
a
taxi
he
had
already
been
delayed
by
half
an
hour
and
there
was
no
need
to
make
the
delay
any
longer
kaminer
ran
to
the
corner
to
summon
it
and
the
two
others
were
making
obvious
efforts
to
keep
diverted
when
kullich
pointed
to
the
doorway
of
the
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
where
the
large
man
with
the
blonde
goatee
beard
appeared
and
a
little
embarrassed
at
first
at
letting
himself
be
seen
in
his
full
height
stepped
back
to
the
wall
and
leant
against
it
the
old
couple
were
probably
still
on
the
stairs
was
cross
with
kullich
for
pointing
out
this
man
whom
he
had
already
seen
himself
in
fact
whom
he
had
been
expecting
do
look
at
him
he
snapped
without
noticing
how
odd
it
was
to
speak
to
free
men
in
this
way
but
there
was
no
explanation
needed
anyway
as
just
then
the
taxi
arrived
they
sat
inside
and
set
off
inside
the
taxi
remembered
that
he
had
not
noticed
the
supervisor
and
the
policemen
leaving
the
supervisor
had
stopped
him
noticing
the
three
bank
staff
and
now
the
three
bank
staff
had
stopped
him
noticing
the
supervisor
this
showed
that
was
not
very
attentive
and
he
resolved
to
watch
himself
more
carefully
in
this
respect
nonetheless
he
gave
it
no
thought
as
he
twisted
himself
round
and
leant
over
onto
the
rear
shelf
of
the
car
to
catch
sight
of
the
supervisor
and
the
policemen
if
he
could
but
he
turned
back
round
straight
away
and
leant
comfortably
into
the
corner
of
the
taxi
without
even
having
made
the
effort
to
see
anyone
although
it
did
not
seem
like
it
now
was
just
the
time
when
he
needed
some
encouragement
but
the
gentlemen
seemed
tired
just
then
rabensteiner
looked
out
of
the
car
to
the
right
kullich
to
the
left
and
only
kaminer
was
there
with
his
grin
at
service
it
would
have
been
inhumane
to
make
fun
of
that
that
spring
whenever
possible
usually
spent
his
evenings
after
work
he
usually
stayed
in
the
office
until
nine
with
a
short
walk
either
by
himself
or
in
the
company
of
some
of
the
bank
officials
and
then
he
would
go
into
a
pub
where
he
would
sit
at
the
regulars
table
with
mostly
older
men
until
eleven
there
were
however
also
exceptions
to
this
habit
times
for
instance
when
was
invited
by
the
bank
manager
whom
he
greatly
respected
for
his
industry
and
trustworthiness
to
go
with
him
for
a
ride
in
his
car
or
to
eat
dinner
with
him
at
his
large
house
would
also
go
once
a
week
to
see
a
girl
called
elsa
who
worked
as
a
waitress
in
a
wine
bar
through
the
night
until
late
in
the
morning
during
the
daytime
she
only
received
visitors
while
still
in
bed
that
evening
though
the
day
had
passed
quickly
with
a
lot
of
hard
work
and
many
respectful
and
friendly
birthday
greetings
wanted
to
go
straight
home
each
time
he
had
any
small
break
from
the
day
work
he
considered
without
knowing
exactly
what
he
had
in
mind
that
grubach
flat
seemed
to
have
been
put
into
great
disarray
by
the
events
of
that
morning
and
that
it
was
up
to
him
to
put
it
back
into
order
once
order
had
been
restored
every
trace
of
those
events
would
have
been
erased
and
everything
would
take
its
previous
course
once
more
in
particular
there
was
nothing
to
fear
from
the
three
bank
officials
they
had
immersed
themselves
back
into
their
paperwork
and
there
was
no
alteration
to
be
seen
in
them
had
called
each
of
them
separately
or
all
together
into
his
office
that
day
for
no
other
reason
than
to
observe
them
he
was
always
satisfied
and
had
always
been
able
to
let
them
go
again
at
half
past
nine
that
evening
when
he
arrived
back
in
front
of
the
building
where
he
lived
he
met
a
young
lad
in
the
doorway
who
was
standing
there
his
legs
apart
and
smoking
a
pipe
who
are
you
immediately
asked
bringing
his
face
close
to
the
lad
as
it
was
hard
to
see
in
the
half
light
of
the
landing
i
the
landlord
son
sir
answered
the
lad
taking
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
stepping
to
one
side
the
landlord
son
asked
and
impatiently
knocked
on
the
ground
with
his
stick
did
you
want
anything
sir
would
you
like
me
to
fetch
my
father
no
no
said
there
was
something
forgiving
in
his
voice
as
if
the
boy
had
harmed
him
in
some
way
and
he
was
excusing
him
it
alright
he
said
then
and
went
on
but
before
going
up
the
stairs
he
turned
round
once
more
he
could
have
gone
directly
to
his
room
but
as
he
wanted
to
speak
with
grubach
he
went
straight
to
her
door
and
knocked
she
was
sat
at
the
table
with
a
knitted
stocking
and
a
pile
of
old
stockings
in
front
of
her
apologised
a
little
embarrassed
at
coming
so
late
but
grubach
was
very
friendly
and
did
not
want
to
hear
any
apology
she
was
always
ready
to
speak
to
him
he
knew
very
well
that
he
was
her
best
and
her
favourite
tenant
looked
round
the
room
it
looked
exactly
as
it
usually
did
the
breakfast
dishes
which
had
been
on
the
table
by
the
window
that
morning
had
already
been
cleared
away
a
woman
hands
will
do
many
things
when
looking
he
thought
he
might
himself
have
smashed
all
the
dishes
on
the
spot
but
certainly
would
not
have
been
able
to
carry
it
all
out
he
looked
at
grubach
with
some
gratitude
why
are
you
working
so
late
he
asked
they
were
now
both
sitting
at
the
table
and
now
and
then
sank
his
hands
into
the
pile
of
stockings
there
a
lot
of
work
to
do
she
said
during
the
day
i
belong
to
the
tenants
if
i
to
sort
out
my
own
things
there
are
only
the
evenings
left
to
me
i
fear
i
may
have
caused
you
some
exceptional
work
today
how
do
you
mean
mr
she
asked
becoming
more
interested
and
leaving
her
work
in
her
lap
i
mean
the
men
who
were
here
this
morning
oh
i
see
she
said
and
went
peacefully
back
to
what
she
was
doing
that
was
no
trouble
not
especially
looked
on
in
silence
as
she
took
up
the
knitted
stocking
once
more
she
seems
surprised
at
my
mentioning
it
he
thought
she
seems
to
think
it
improper
for
me
to
mention
it
all
the
more
important
for
me
to
do
so
an
old
woman
is
the
only
person
i
can
speak
about
it
with
but
it
must
have
caused
some
work
for
you
he
said
then
but
it
wo
happen
again
no
it
ca
happen
again
she
agreed
and
smiled
at
in
a
way
that
was
almost
pained
do
you
mean
that
seriously
asked
yes
she
said
more
gently
but
the
important
thing
is
you
must
take
it
too
hard
there
are
so
many
awful
things
happening
in
the
world
as
you
being
so
honest
with
me
i
can
admit
to
you
that
i
listened
to
a
little
of
what
was
going
on
from
behind
the
door
and
that
those
two
policemen
told
me
one
or
two
things
as
well
it
all
to
do
with
your
happiness
and
something
that
quite
close
to
my
heart
perhaps
more
than
it
should
be
as
i
am
after
all
only
your
landlady
anyway
so
i
heard
one
or
two
things
but
i
ca
really
say
that
it
about
anything
very
serious
no
you
have
been
arrested
but
it
not
in
the
same
way
as
when
they
arrest
a
thief
if
you
arrested
in
the
same
way
as
a
thief
then
it
bad
but
an
arrest
like
this
it
seems
to
me
that
something
very
complicated
forgive
me
if
i
saying
something
stupid
something
very
complicated
that
i
do
understand
but
something
that
you
do
really
need
to
understand
anyway
there
nothing
stupid
about
what
you
said
grubach
or
at
least
i
partly
agree
with
you
only
the
way
i
judge
the
whole
thing
is
harsher
than
yours
and
think
it
not
only
not
something
complicated
but
simply
a
fuss
about
nothing
i
was
just
caught
unawares
what
happened
if
i
had
got
up
as
soon
as
i
was
awake
without
letting
myself
get
confused
because
anna
was
there
if
i
got
up
and
paid
no
regard
to
anyone
who
might
have
been
in
my
way
and
come
straight
to
you
if
i
done
something
like
having
my
breakfast
in
the
kitchen
as
an
exception
asked
you
to
bring
my
clothes
from
my
room
in
short
if
i
had
behaved
sensibly
then
nothing
more
would
have
happened
everything
that
was
waiting
to
happen
would
have
been
stifled
people
are
so
often
unprepared
in
the
bank
for
example
i
am
well
prepared
nothing
of
this
sort
could
possibly
happen
to
me
there
i
have
my
own
assistant
there
there
are
telephones
for
internal
and
external
calls
in
front
of
me
on
the
desk
i
continually
receive
visits
from
people
representatives
officials
but
besides
that
and
most
importantly
always
occupied
with
my
work
that
to
say
i
always
alert
it
would
even
be
a
pleasure
for
me
to
find
myself
faced
with
something
of
that
sort
but
now
it
over
with
and
i
did
really
even
want
to
talk
about
it
any
more
only
i
wanted
to
hear
what
you
as
a
sensible
woman
thought
about
it
all
and
i
very
glad
to
hear
that
we
in
agreement
but
now
you
must
give
me
your
hand
an
agreement
of
this
sort
needs
to
be
confirmed
with
a
handshake
will
she
shake
hands
with
me
the
supervisor
did
shake
hands
he
thought
and
looked
at
the
woman
differently
from
before
examining
her
she
stood
up
as
he
had
also
stood
up
and
was
a
little
conscious
she
had
been
able
to
understand
everything
that
said
as
a
result
of
this
self
consciousness
she
said
something
that
she
certainly
did
not
intend
and
certainly
was
not
appropriate
take
it
so
hard
she
said
with
tears
in
her
voice
and
also
of
course
forgetting
the
handshake
i
did
know
i
was
taking
it
hard
said
feeling
suddenly
tired
and
seeing
that
if
this
woman
did
agree
with
him
it
was
of
very
little
value
before
going
out
the
door
he
asked
is
miss
b√ºrstner
home
no
said
grubach
smiling
as
she
gave
this
simple
piece
of
information
saying
something
sensible
at
last
she
at
the
theatre
did
you
want
to
see
her
should
i
give
her
a
message
i
er
i
just
wanted
to
have
a
few
words
with
her
i
afraid
i
do
know
when
she
coming
in
she
usually
gets
back
late
when
she
been
to
the
theatre
it
really
does
matter
said
his
head
hanging
as
he
turned
to
the
door
to
leave
i
just
wanted
to
give
her
my
apology
for
taking
over
her
room
today
there
no
need
for
that
too
conscientious
the
young
lady
does
know
anything
about
it
she
has
been
home
since
early
this
morning
and
everything
been
tidied
up
again
you
can
see
for
yourself
and
she
opened
the
door
to
miss
b√ºrstner
room
thank
you
i
take
your
word
for
it
said
k
but
went
nonetheless
over
to
the
open
door
the
moon
shone
quietly
into
the
unlit
room
as
far
as
could
be
seen
everything
was
indeed
in
its
place
not
even
the
blouse
was
hanging
on
the
window
handle
the
pillows
on
the
bed
looked
remarkably
plump
as
they
lay
half
in
the
moonlight
miss
b√ºrstner
often
comes
home
late
said
looking
at
grubach
as
if
that
were
her
responsibility
that
how
young
people
are
said
grubach
to
excuse
herself
of
course
of
course
said
but
it
can
be
taken
too
far
yes
it
can
be
said
grubach
you
so
right
perhaps
it
is
in
this
case
i
certainly
would
want
to
say
anything
nasty
about
miss
b√ºrstner
she
is
a
good
sweet
girl
friendly
tidy
punctual
works
hard
i
appreciate
all
that
very
much
but
one
thing
is
true
she
ought
to
have
more
pride
be
a
bit
less
forthcoming
twice
this
month
already
in
the
street
over
the
way
i
seen
her
with
a
different
gentleman
i
really
do
like
saying
this
you
the
only
one
i
said
this
to
i
swear
to
god
but
i
going
to
have
no
choice
but
to
have
a
few
words
with
miss
b√ºrstner
about
it
myself
and
it
not
the
only
thing
about
her
that
i
worried
about
grubach
you
are
on
quite
the
wrong
track
said
so
angry
that
he
was
hardly
able
to
hide
it
and
you
have
moreover
misunderstood
what
i
was
saying
about
miss
b√ºrstner
that
is
not
what
i
meant
in
fact
i
warn
you
quite
directly
not
to
say
anything
to
her
you
are
quite
mistaken
i
know
miss
b√ºrstner
very
well
and
there
is
no
truth
at
all
in
what
you
say
and
what
more
perhaps
i
going
to
far
i
do
want
to
get
in
your
way
say
to
her
whatever
you
see
fit
good
night
said
grubach
as
if
asking
him
for
something
and
hurrying
to
his
door
which
he
had
already
opened
i
do
want
to
speak
to
miss
b√ºrstner
at
all
not
yet
of
course
continue
to
keep
an
eye
on
her
but
you
the
only
one
i
told
what
i
know
and
it
is
after
all
something
that
everyone
who
lets
rooms
has
to
do
if
she
to
keep
the
house
decent
that
all
i
trying
to
do
decent
called
out
through
the
crack
in
the
door
if
you
want
to
keep
the
house
decent
you
first
have
to
give
me
notice
then
he
slammed
the
door
shut
there
was
a
gentle
knocking
to
which
he
paid
no
more
attention
he
did
not
feel
at
all
like
going
to
bed
so
he
decided
to
stay
up
and
this
would
also
give
him
the
chance
to
find
out
when
miss
b√ºrstner
would
arrive
home
perhaps
it
would
also
still
be
possible
even
if
a
little
inappropriate
to
have
a
few
words
with
her
as
he
lay
there
by
the
window
pressing
his
hands
to
his
tired
eyes
he
even
thought
for
a
moment
that
he
might
punish
grubach
by
persuading
miss
b√ºrstner
to
give
in
her
notice
at
the
same
time
as
he
would
but
he
immediately
realised
that
that
would
be
shockingly
excessive
and
there
would
even
be
the
suspicion
that
he
was
moving
house
because
of
the
incidents
of
that
morning
nothing
would
have
been
more
nonsensical
and
above
all
more
pointless
and
contemptible
when
he
had
become
tired
of
looking
out
onto
the
empty
street
he
slightly
opened
the
door
to
the
living
room
so
that
he
could
see
anyone
who
entered
the
flat
from
where
he
was
and
lay
down
on
the
couch
he
lay
there
quietly
smoking
a
cigar
until
about
eleven
he
was
able
to
hold
out
longer
than
that
and
went
a
little
way
into
the
hallway
as
if
in
that
way
he
could
make
miss
b√ºrstner
arrive
sooner
he
had
no
particular
desire
for
her
he
could
not
even
remember
what
she
looked
like
but
now
he
wanted
to
speak
to
her
and
it
irritated
him
that
her
late
arrival
home
meant
this
day
would
be
full
of
unease
and
disorder
right
to
its
very
end
it
was
also
her
fault
that
he
had
not
had
any
dinner
that
evening
and
that
he
had
been
unable
to
visit
elsa
as
he
had
intended
he
could
still
make
up
for
both
of
those
things
though
if
he
went
to
the
wine
bar
where
elsa
worked
he
wanted
to
do
so
even
later
after
the
discussion
with
miss
b√ºrstner
it
was
already
gone
half
past
eleven
when
someone
could
be
heard
in
the
stairway
who
had
been
lost
in
his
thoughts
in
the
hallway
walking
up
and
down
loudly
as
if
it
were
his
own
room
fled
behind
his
door
miss
b√ºrstner
had
arrived
shivering
she
pulled
a
silk
shawl
over
her
slender
shoulders
as
she
locked
the
door
the
next
moment
she
would
certainly
go
into
her
room
where
ought
not
to
intrude
in
the
middle
of
the
night
that
meant
he
would
have
to
speak
to
her
now
but
unfortunately
he
had
not
put
the
electric
light
on
in
his
room
so
that
when
he
stepped
out
of
the
dark
it
would
give
the
impression
of
being
an
attack
and
would
certainly
at
the
very
least
have
been
quite
alarming
there
was
no
time
to
lose
and
in
his
helplessness
he
whispered
through
the
crack
of
the
door
miss
b√ºrstner
it
sounded
like
he
was
pleading
with
her
not
calling
to
her
is
there
someone
there
asked
miss
b√ºrstner
looking
round
with
her
eyes
wide
open
it
me
said
and
came
out
oh
mr
said
miss
b√ºrstner
with
a
smile
good
evening
and
offered
him
her
hand
i
wanted
to
have
a
word
with
you
if
you
would
allow
me
now
asked
miss
b√ºrstner
does
it
have
to
be
now
it
is
a
little
odd
is
it
i
been
waiting
for
you
since
nine
well
i
was
at
the
theatre
i
did
know
anything
about
you
waiting
for
me
the
reason
i
need
to
speak
to
you
only
came
up
today
i
see
well
i
do
see
why
not
i
suppose
apart
from
being
so
tired
i
could
drop
come
into
my
room
for
a
few
minutes
then
we
certainly
ca
talk
out
here
we
wake
everyone
up
and
i
think
that
would
be
more
unpleasant
for
us
than
for
them
wait
here
till
i
put
the
light
on
in
my
room
and
then
turn
the
light
down
out
here
did
as
he
was
told
and
then
even
waited
until
miss
b√ºrstner
came
out
of
her
room
and
quietly
invited
him
once
more
to
come
in
sit
down
she
said
indicating
the
ottoman
while
she
herself
remained
standing
by
the
bedpost
despite
the
tiredness
she
had
spoken
of
she
did
not
even
take
off
her
hat
which
was
small
but
decorated
with
an
abundance
of
flowers
what
is
it
you
wanted
then
i
really
quite
curious
she
gently
crossed
her
legs
i
expect
you
say
began
that
the
matter
really
is
all
that
urgent
and
we
do
need
to
talk
about
it
right
now
but
i
never
listen
to
introductions
said
miss
b√ºrstner
that
makes
my
job
so
much
easier
said
this
morning
to
some
extent
through
my
fault
your
room
was
made
a
little
untidy
this
happened
because
of
people
i
did
not
know
and
against
my
will
but
as
i
said
because
of
my
fault
i
wanted
to
apologise
for
it
my
room
asked
miss
b√ºrstner
and
instead
of
looking
round
the
room
scrutinised
it
is
true
said
and
now
for
the
first
time
they
looked
each
other
in
the
eyes
there
no
point
in
saying
exactly
how
this
came
about
but
the
interesting
thing
about
it
said
miss
b√ºrstner
no
said
well
then
said
miss
b√ºrstner
i
do
want
to
force
my
way
into
any
secrets
if
you
insist
that
it
of
no
interest
i
wo
insist
quite
happy
to
forgive
you
for
it
as
you
ask
especially
as
i
ca
see
anything
at
all
that
been
left
untidy
with
her
hand
laid
flat
on
her
lower
hip
she
made
a
tour
around
the
room
at
the
mat
where
the
photographs
were
she
stopped
look
at
this
she
cried
my
photographs
really
have
been
put
in
the
wrong
places
oh
horrible
someone
really
has
been
in
my
room
without
permission
nodded
and
quietly
cursed
kaminer
who
worked
at
his
bank
and
who
was
always
active
doing
things
that
had
neither
use
nor
purpose
it
is
odd
said
miss
b√ºrstner
that
i
forced
to
forbid
you
to
do
something
that
you
ought
to
have
forbidden
yourself
to
do
namely
to
come
into
my
room
when
i
not
here
but
i
did
explain
to
you
said
and
went
over
to
join
her
by
the
photographs
that
it
was
me
who
interfered
with
your
photographs
but
as
you
do
believe
me
i
have
to
admit
that
the
investigating
committee
brought
along
three
bank
employees
with
them
one
of
them
must
have
touched
your
photographs
and
as
soon
as
i
get
the
chance
i
ask
to
have
him
dismissed
from
the
bank
yes
there
was
an
investigating
committee
here
added
as
the
young
lady
was
looking
at
him
enquiringly
because
of
you
she
asked
yes
answered
k
no
the
lady
cried
with
a
laugh
yes
they
were
said
you
believe
that
i
innocent
then
do
you
well
now
innocent
said
the
lady
i
do
want
to
start
making
any
pronouncements
that
might
have
serious
consequences
i
do
really
know
you
after
all
it
means
they
dealing
with
a
serious
criminal
if
they
send
an
investigating
committee
straight
out
to
get
him
but
you
not
in
custody
now
at
least
i
take
it
you
not
escaped
from
prison
considering
that
you
seem
quite
calm
so
you
ca
have
committed
any
crime
of
that
sort
yes
said
but
it
might
be
that
the
investigating
committee
could
see
that
i
innocent
or
not
so
guilty
as
had
been
supposed
yes
that
certainly
a
possibility
said
miss
b√ºrstner
who
seemed
very
interested
listen
said
you
have
much
experience
in
legal
matters
no
that
true
i
do
said
miss
b√ºrstner
and
i
often
regretted
it
as
i
like
to
know
everything
and
i
very
interested
in
legal
matters
there
something
peculiarly
attractive
about
the
law
is
there
but
i
certainly
be
perfecting
my
knowledge
in
this
area
as
next
month
i
start
work
in
a
legal
office
that
very
good
said
that
means
you
be
able
to
give
me
some
help
with
my
trial
that
could
well
be
said
miss
b√ºrstner
why
not
i
like
to
make
use
of
what
i
know
i
mean
it
quite
seriously
said
or
at
least
half
seriously
as
you
do
this
affair
is
too
petty
to
call
in
a
lawyer
but
i
could
make
good
use
of
someone
who
could
give
me
advice
yes
but
if
i
to
give
you
advice
i
have
to
know
what
it
all
about
said
miss
b√ºrstner
that
exactly
the
problem
said
i
do
know
that
myself
so
you
have
been
making
fun
of
me
then
said
miss
b√ºrstner
exceedingly
disappointed
you
really
ought
not
to
try
something
like
that
on
at
this
time
of
night
and
she
stepped
away
from
the
photographs
where
they
had
stood
so
long
together
miss
b√ºrstner
no
said
i
not
making
fun
of
you
please
believe
me
i
already
told
you
everything
i
know
more
than
i
know
in
fact
as
it
actually
was
even
an
investigating
committee
that
just
what
i
called
them
because
i
know
what
else
to
call
them
there
was
no
cross
questioning
at
all
i
was
merely
arrested
but
by
a
committee
miss
b√ºrstner
sat
on
the
ottoman
and
laughed
again
what
was
it
like
then
she
asked
it
was
terrible
said
although
his
mind
was
no
longer
on
the
subject
he
had
become
totally
absorbed
by
miss
b√ºrstner
gaze
who
was
supporting
her
chin
on
one
hand
the
elbow
rested
on
the
cushion
of
the
ottoman
and
slowly
stroking
her
hip
with
the
other
that
too
vague
said
miss
b√ºrstner
what
too
vague
asked
then
he
remembered
himself
and
asked
would
you
like
me
to
show
you
what
it
was
like
he
wanted
to
move
in
some
way
but
did
not
want
to
leave
i
already
tired
said
miss
b√ºrstner
you
arrived
back
so
late
said
now
started
telling
me
off
well
i
suppose
i
deserve
it
as
i
should
have
let
you
in
here
in
the
first
place
and
it
turns
out
there
was
even
any
point
oh
there
was
a
point
you
see
now
how
important
a
point
it
was
said
may
i
move
this
table
away
from
your
bedside
and
put
it
here
what
do
you
think
you
doing
said
miss
b√ºrstner
of
course
you
ca
in
that
case
i
ca
show
you
said
quite
upset
as
if
miss
b√ºrstner
had
committed
some
incomprehensible
offence
against
him
alright
then
if
you
need
it
to
show
what
you
mean
just
take
the
bedside
table
then
said
miss
b√ºrstner
and
after
a
short
pause
added
in
a
weak
voice
i
so
tired
i
allowing
more
than
i
ought
to
put
the
little
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
sat
down
behind
it
you
have
to
get
a
proper
idea
of
where
the
people
were
situated
it
is
very
interesting
i
the
supervisor
sitting
over
there
on
the
chest
are
two
policemen
standing
next
to
the
photographs
there
are
three
young
people
hanging
on
the
handle
of
the
window
is
a
white
blouse
i
just
mention
that
by
the
way
and
now
it
begins
ah
yes
i
forgetting
myself
the
most
important
person
of
all
so
standing
here
in
front
of
the
table
the
supervisor
is
sitting
extremely
comfortably
with
his
legs
crossed
and
his
arm
hanging
over
the
backrest
here
like
some
layabout
and
now
it
really
does
begin
the
supervisor
calls
out
as
if
he
had
to
wake
me
up
in
fact
he
shouts
at
me
i
afraid
if
i
to
make
it
clear
to
you
i
have
to
shout
as
well
and
it
nothing
more
than
my
name
that
he
shouts
out
miss
b√ºrstner
laughing
as
she
listened
to
him
laid
her
forefinger
on
her
mouth
so
that
would
not
shout
but
it
was
too
late
was
too
engrossed
in
his
role
and
slowly
called
out
josef
it
was
not
as
loud
as
he
had
threatened
but
nonetheless
once
he
had
suddenly
called
it
out
the
cry
seemed
gradually
to
spread
itself
all
round
the
room
there
was
a
series
of
loud
curt
and
regular
knocks
at
the
door
of
the
adjoining
room
miss
b√ºrstner
went
pale
and
laid
her
hand
on
her
heart
was
especially
startled
as
for
a
moment
he
had
been
quite
unable
to
think
of
anything
other
than
the
events
of
that
morning
and
the
girl
for
whom
he
was
performing
them
he
had
hardly
pulled
himself
together
when
he
jumped
over
to
miss
b√ºrstner
and
took
her
hand
be
afraid
he
whispered
i
put
everything
right
but
who
can
it
be
it
only
the
living
room
next
door
nobody
sleeps
in
there
yes
they
do
whispered
miss
b√ºrstner
into
ear
a
nephew
of
grubach
an
captain
in
the
army
has
been
sleeping
there
since
yesterday
there
no
other
room
free
i
forgotten
about
it
too
why
did
you
have
to
shout
like
that
you
made
me
quite
upset
there
is
no
reason
for
it
said
and
now
as
she
sank
back
onto
the
cushion
kissed
her
forehead
go
away
go
away
she
said
hurriedly
sitting
back
up
get
out
of
here
go
what
is
it
you
want
listening
at
the
door
he
can
hear
everything
you
causing
me
so
much
trouble
i
wo
go
said
until
you
calmed
down
a
bit
come
over
into
the
other
corner
of
the
room
he
wo
be
able
to
hear
us
there
she
let
him
lead
her
there
do
forget
he
said
although
this
might
be
unpleasant
for
you
you
not
in
any
real
danger
you
know
how
much
esteem
grubach
has
for
me
she
the
one
who
will
make
all
the
decisions
in
this
especially
as
the
captain
is
her
nephew
but
she
believes
everything
i
say
without
question
what
more
she
has
borrowed
a
large
sum
of
money
from
me
and
that
makes
her
dependent
on
me
i
will
confirm
whatever
you
say
to
explain
our
being
here
together
however
inappropriate
it
might
be
and
i
guarantee
to
make
sure
that
grubach
will
not
only
say
she
believes
the
explanation
in
public
but
will
believe
it
truly
and
sincerely
you
will
have
no
need
to
consider
me
in
any
way
if
you
wish
to
let
it
be
known
that
i
have
attacked
you
then
grubach
will
be
informed
of
such
and
she
will
believe
it
without
even
losing
her
trust
in
me
that
how
much
respect
she
has
for
me
miss
b√ºrstner
looked
at
the
floor
in
front
of
her
quiet
and
a
little
sunk
in
on
herself
why
would
grubach
not
believe
that
i
attacked
you
added
he
looked
at
her
hair
in
front
of
him
parted
bunched
down
reddish
and
firmly
held
in
place
he
thought
she
would
look
up
at
him
but
without
changing
her
manner
she
said
forgive
me
but
it
was
the
suddenness
of
the
knocking
that
startled
me
so
much
not
so
much
what
the
consequences
of
the
captain
being
here
might
be
it
was
all
so
quiet
after
you
shouted
and
then
there
was
the
knocking
that
was
made
me
so
shocked
and
i
was
sitting
right
by
the
door
the
knocking
was
right
next
to
me
thank
you
for
your
suggestions
but
i
wo
accept
them
i
can
bear
the
responsibility
for
anything
that
happens
in
my
room
myself
and
i
can
do
so
with
anyone
i
surprised
you
do
realise
just
how
insulting
your
suggestions
are
and
what
they
imply
about
me
although
i
certainly
acknowledge
your
good
intentions
but
now
please
go
leave
me
alone
i
need
you
to
go
now
even
more
than
i
did
earlier
the
couple
of
minutes
you
asked
for
have
grown
into
half
an
hour
more
than
half
an
hour
now
took
hold
of
her
hand
and
then
of
her
wrist
you
not
cross
with
me
though
he
said
she
pulled
her
hand
away
and
answered
no
no
i
never
cross
with
anyone
he
grasped
her
wrist
once
more
she
tolerated
it
now
and
in
that
way
lead
him
to
the
door
he
had
fully
intended
to
leave
but
when
he
reached
the
door
he
came
to
a
halt
as
if
he
had
expected
to
find
a
door
there
miss
b√ºrstner
made
use
of
that
moment
to
get
herself
free
open
the
door
slip
out
into
the
hallway
and
gently
say
to
from
there
now
come
along
please
look
she
pointed
to
the
captain
door
from
under
which
there
was
a
light
shining
he
put
a
light
on
and
he
laughing
at
us
alright
coming
said
moved
forward
took
hold
of
her
kissed
her
on
the
mouth
and
then
over
her
whole
face
like
a
thirsty
animal
lapping
with
its
tongue
when
it
eventually
finds
water
he
finally
kissed
her
on
her
neck
and
her
throat
and
left
his
lips
pressed
there
for
a
long
time
he
did
not
look
up
until
there
was
a
noise
from
the
captain
room
go
now
he
said
he
wanted
to
address
miss
b√ºrstner
by
her
christian
name
but
did
not
know
it
she
gave
him
a
tired
nod
offered
him
her
hand
to
kiss
as
she
turned
away
as
if
she
did
not
know
what
she
was
doing
and
went
back
into
her
room
with
her
head
bowed
a
short
while
later
was
lying
in
his
bed
he
very
soon
went
to
sleep
but
before
he
did
he
thought
a
little
while
about
his
behaviour
he
was
satisfied
with
it
but
felt
some
surprise
that
he
was
not
more
satisfied
he
was
seriously
worried
about
miss
b√ºrstner
because
of
the
captain
chapter
two
first
was
informed
by
telephone
that
there
would
be
a
small
hearing
concerning
his
case
the
following
sunday
he
was
made
aware
that
these
cross
examinations
would
follow
one
another
regularly
perhaps
not
every
week
but
quite
frequently
on
the
one
hand
it
was
in
everyone
interest
to
bring
proceedings
quickly
to
their
conclusion
but
on
the
other
hand
every
aspect
of
the
examinations
had
to
be
carried
out
thoroughly
without
lasting
too
long
because
of
the
associated
stress
for
these
reasons
it
had
been
decided
to
hold
a
series
of
brief
examinations
following
on
one
after
another
sunday
had
been
chosen
as
the
day
for
the
hearings
so
that
would
not
be
disturbed
in
his
professional
work
it
was
assumed
that
he
would
be
in
agreement
with
this
but
if
he
wished
for
another
date
then
as
far
as
possible
he
would
be
accommodated
could
even
be
held
in
the
night
for
instance
but
would
probably
not
be
fresh
enough
at
that
time
anyway
as
long
as
made
no
objection
the
hearing
would
be
left
on
sundays
it
was
a
matter
of
course
that
he
would
have
to
appear
without
fail
there
was
probably
no
need
to
point
this
out
to
him
he
would
be
given
the
number
of
the
building
where
he
was
to
present
himself
which
was
in
a
street
in
a
suburb
well
away
from
the
city
centre
which
had
never
been
to
before
once
he
had
received
this
notice
hung
up
the
receiver
without
giving
an
answer
he
had
decided
immediately
to
go
there
that
sunday
it
was
certainly
necessary
proceedings
had
begun
and
he
had
to
face
up
to
it
and
this
first
examination
would
probably
also
be
the
last
he
was
still
standing
in
thought
by
the
telephone
when
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
deputy
director
behind
him
he
wanted
to
use
the
telephone
but
stood
in
his
way
bad
news
asked
the
deputy
director
casually
not
in
order
to
find
anything
out
but
just
to
get
away
from
the
device
no
no
said
he
stepped
to
one
side
but
did
not
go
away
entirely
the
deputy
director
picked
up
the
receiver
and
as
he
waited
for
his
connection
turned
away
from
it
and
said
to
one
question
would
you
like
to
give
me
the
pleasure
of
joining
me
on
my
sailing
boat
on
sunday
morning
there
quite
a
few
people
coming
you
bound
to
know
some
of
them
one
of
them
is
hasterer
the
state
attorney
would
you
like
to
come
along
do
come
along
tried
to
pay
attention
to
what
the
deputy
director
was
saying
it
was
of
no
small
importance
for
him
as
this
invitation
from
the
deputy
director
with
whom
he
had
never
got
on
very
well
meant
that
he
was
trying
to
improve
his
relations
with
him
it
showed
how
important
had
become
in
the
bank
and
how
its
second
most
important
official
seemed
to
value
his
friendship
or
at
least
his
impartiality
he
was
only
speaking
at
the
side
of
the
telephone
receiver
while
he
waited
for
his
connection
but
in
giving
this
invitation
the
deputy
director
was
humbling
himself
but
would
have
to
humiliate
him
a
second
time
as
a
result
he
said
thank
you
very
much
but
i
afraid
i
will
have
no
time
on
sunday
i
have
a
previous
obligation
pity
said
the
deputy
director
and
turned
to
the
telephone
conversation
that
had
just
been
connected
it
was
not
a
short
conversation
but
remained
standing
confused
by
the
instrument
all
the
time
it
was
going
on
it
was
only
when
the
deputy
director
hung
up
that
he
was
shocked
into
awareness
and
said
in
order
to
partially
excuse
his
standing
there
for
no
reason
i
just
received
a
telephone
call
there
somewhere
i
need
to
go
but
they
forgot
to
tell
me
what
time
ask
them
then
said
the
deputy
director
it
not
that
important
said
although
in
that
way
his
earlier
excuse
already
weak
enough
was
made
even
weaker
as
he
went
the
deputy
director
continued
to
speak
about
other
things
forced
himself
to
answer
but
his
thoughts
were
mainly
about
that
sunday
how
it
would
be
best
to
get
there
for
nine
in
the
morning
as
that
was
the
time
that
courts
always
start
work
on
weekdays
the
weather
was
dull
on
sunday
was
very
tired
as
he
had
stayed
out
drinking
until
late
in
the
night
celebrating
with
some
of
the
regulars
and
he
had
almost
overslept
he
dressed
hurriedly
without
the
time
to
think
and
assemble
the
various
plans
he
had
worked
out
during
the
week
with
no
breakfast
he
rushed
to
the
suburb
he
had
been
told
about
oddly
enough
although
he
had
little
time
to
look
around
him
he
came
across
the
three
bank
officials
involved
in
his
case
rabensteiner
kullich
and
kaminer
the
first
two
were
travelling
in
a
tram
that
went
across
route
but
kaminer
sat
on
the
terrace
of
a
caf√©
and
leant
curiously
over
the
wall
as
came
over
all
of
them
seemed
to
be
looking
at
him
surprised
at
seeing
their
superior
running
it
was
a
kind
of
pride
that
made
want
to
go
on
foot
this
was
his
affair
and
the
idea
of
any
help
from
strangers
however
slight
was
repulsive
to
him
he
also
wanted
to
avoid
asking
for
anyone
help
because
that
would
initiate
them
into
the
affair
even
if
only
slightly
and
after
all
he
had
no
wish
at
all
to
humiliate
himself
before
the
committee
by
being
too
punctual
anyway
now
he
was
running
so
that
he
would
get
there
by
nine
if
at
all
possible
even
though
he
had
no
appointment
for
this
time
he
had
thought
that
he
would
recognise
the
building
from
a
distance
by
some
kind
of
sign
without
knowing
exactly
what
the
sign
would
look
like
or
from
some
particular
kind
of
activity
outside
the
entrance
had
been
told
that
the
building
was
in
juliusstrasse
but
when
he
stood
at
the
street
entrance
it
consisted
on
each
side
of
almost
nothing
but
monotonous
grey
constructions
tall
blocks
of
flats
occupied
by
poor
people
now
on
a
sunday
morning
most
of
the
windows
were
occupied
men
in
their
shirtsleeves
leant
out
smoking
or
carefully
and
gently
held
small
children
on
the
sills
other
windows
were
piled
up
with
bedding
above
which
the
dishevelled
head
of
a
woman
would
briefly
appear
people
called
out
to
each
other
across
the
street
one
of
the
calls
provoked
a
loud
laugh
about
himself
it
was
a
long
street
and
spaced
evenly
along
it
were
small
shops
below
street
level
selling
various
kinds
of
foodstuffs
which
you
reached
by
going
down
a
few
steps
women
went
in
and
out
of
them
or
stood
chatting
on
the
steps
a
fruitmonger
taking
his
goods
up
to
the
windows
was
just
as
inattentive
as
and
nearly
knocked
him
down
with
his
cart
just
then
a
gramophone
which
in
better
parts
of
town
would
have
been
seen
as
worn
out
began
to
play
some
murderous
tune
went
further
into
the
street
slowly
as
if
he
had
plenty
of
time
now
or
as
if
the
examining
magistrate
were
looking
at
him
from
one
of
the
windows
and
therefore
knew
that
had
found
his
way
there
it
was
shortly
after
nine
the
building
was
quite
far
down
the
street
it
covered
so
much
area
it
was
almost
extraordinary
and
the
gateway
in
particular
was
tall
and
long
it
was
clearly
intended
for
delivery
wagons
belonging
to
the
various
warehouses
all
round
the
yard
which
were
now
locked
up
and
carried
the
names
of
companies
some
of
which
knew
from
his
work
at
the
bank
in
contrast
with
his
usual
habits
he
remained
standing
a
while
at
the
entrance
to
the
yard
taking
in
all
these
external
details
near
him
there
was
a
man
sitting
on
a
crate
and
reading
a
newspaper
there
were
two
lads
swinging
on
a
hand
cart
in
front
of
a
pump
stood
a
weak
young
girl
in
a
bedjacket
who
as
the
water
flowed
into
her
can
looked
at
there
was
a
piece
of
rope
stretched
between
two
windows
in
a
corner
of
the
yard
with
some
washing
hanging
on
it
to
dry
a
man
stood
below
it
calling
out
instructions
to
direct
the
work
being
done
went
over
to
the
stairway
to
get
to
the
room
where
the
hearing
was
to
take
place
but
then
stood
still
again
as
besides
these
steps
he
could
see
three
other
stairway
entrances
and
there
also
seemed
to
be
a
small
passageway
at
the
end
of
the
yard
leading
into
a
second
yard
it
irritated
him
that
he
had
not
been
given
more
precise
directions
to
the
room
it
meant
they
were
either
being
especially
neglectful
with
him
or
especially
indifferent
and
he
decided
to
make
that
clear
to
them
very
loudly
and
very
unambiguously
in
the
end
he
decided
to
climb
up
the
stairs
his
thoughts
playing
on
something
that
he
remembered
the
policeman
willem
saying
to
him
that
the
court
is
attracted
by
the
guilt
from
which
it
followed
that
the
courtroom
must
be
on
the
stairway
that
selected
by
chance
as
he
went
up
he
disturbed
a
large
group
of
children
playing
on
the
stairs
who
looked
at
him
as
he
stepped
through
their
rows
next
time
i
come
here
he
said
to
himself
i
must
either
bring
sweets
with
me
to
make
them
like
me
or
a
stick
to
hit
them
with
just
before
he
reached
the
first
landing
he
even
had
to
wait
a
little
while
until
a
ball
had
finished
its
movement
two
small
lads
with
sly
faces
like
scoundrels
held
him
by
his
until
it
had
if
he
were
to
shake
them
off
he
would
have
to
hurt
them
and
he
was
afraid
of
what
noise
they
would
make
by
shouting
on
the
first
floor
his
search
began
for
real
he
still
felt
unable
to
ask
for
the
investigating
committee
and
so
he
invented
a
joiner
called
lanz
that
name
occurred
to
him
because
the
captain
grubach
nephew
was
called
lanz
so
that
he
could
ask
at
every
flat
whether
lanz
the
joiner
lived
there
and
thus
obtain
a
chance
to
look
into
the
rooms
it
turned
out
though
that
that
was
mostly
possible
without
further
ado
as
almost
all
the
doors
were
left
open
and
the
children
ran
in
and
out
most
of
them
were
small
rooms
where
they
also
did
the
cooking
many
women
held
babies
in
one
arm
and
worked
at
the
stove
with
the
other
half
grown
girls
who
seemed
to
be
dressed
in
just
their
pinafores
worked
hardest
running
to
and
fro
in
every
room
the
beds
were
still
in
use
by
people
who
were
ill
or
still
asleep
or
people
stretched
out
on
them
in
their
clothes
knocked
at
the
flats
where
the
doors
were
closed
and
asked
whether
lanz
the
joiner
lived
there
it
was
usually
a
woman
who
opened
the
door
heard
the
enquiry
and
turned
to
somebody
in
the
room
who
would
raise
himself
from
the
bed
the
gentleman
asking
if
a
joiner
called
lanz
lives
here
a
joiner
called
lanz
he
would
ask
from
the
bed
that
right
would
say
although
it
was
clear
that
the
investigating
committee
was
not
to
be
found
there
and
so
his
task
was
at
an
end
there
were
many
who
thought
it
must
be
very
important
for
to
find
lanz
the
joiner
and
thought
long
about
it
naming
a
joiner
who
was
not
called
lanz
or
giving
a
name
that
had
some
vague
similarity
with
lanz
or
they
asked
neighbours
or
accompanied
to
a
door
a
long
way
away
where
they
thought
someone
of
that
sort
might
live
in
the
back
part
of
the
building
or
where
someone
would
be
who
could
advise
better
than
they
could
themselves
eventually
had
to
give
up
asking
if
he
did
not
want
to
be
led
all
round
from
floor
to
floor
in
this
way
he
regretted
his
initial
plan
which
had
at
first
seemed
so
practical
to
him
as
he
reached
the
fifth
floor
he
decided
to
give
up
the
search
took
his
leave
of
a
friendly
young
worker
who
wanted
to
lead
him
on
still
further
and
went
down
the
stairs
but
then
the
thought
of
how
much
time
he
was
wasting
made
him
cross
he
went
back
again
and
knocked
at
the
first
door
on
the
fifth
floor
the
first
thing
he
saw
in
the
small
room
was
a
large
clock
on
the
wall
which
already
showed
ten
is
there
a
joiner
called
lanz
who
lives
here
he
asked
pardon
said
a
young
woman
with
black
shining
eyes
who
was
at
that
moment
washing
children
underclothes
in
a
bucket
she
pointed
her
wet
hand
towards
the
open
door
of
the
adjoining
room
thought
he
had
stepped
into
a
meeting
a
medium
sized
two
windowed
room
was
filled
with
the
most
diverse
crowd
of
people
nobody
paid
any
attention
to
the
person
who
had
just
entered
close
under
its
ceiling
it
was
surrounded
by
a
gallery
which
was
also
fully
occupied
and
where
the
people
could
only
stand
bent
down
with
their
heads
and
their
backs
touching
the
ceiling
who
found
the
air
too
stuffy
stepped
out
again
and
said
to
the
young
woman
who
had
probably
misunderstood
what
he
had
said
i
asked
for
a
joiner
someone
by
the
name
of
lanz
yes
said
the
woman
please
go
on
in
would
probably
not
have
followed
her
if
the
woman
had
not
gone
up
to
him
taken
hold
of
the
door
handle
and
said
i
have
to
close
the
door
after
you
else
will
be
allowed
in
very
sensible
said
but
it
too
full
already
but
then
he
went
back
in
anyway
he
passed
through
between
two
men
who
were
talking
beside
the
door
one
of
them
held
both
hands
far
out
in
front
of
himself
making
the
movements
of
counting
out
money
the
other
looked
him
closely
in
the
eyes
and
someone
took
him
by
the
hand
it
was
a
small
youth
come
in
come
in
he
said
let
himself
be
led
by
him
and
it
turned
out
that
there
was
surprisingly
in
a
densely
packed
crowd
of
people
moving
to
and
fro
a
narrow
passage
which
may
have
been
the
division
between
two
factions
this
idea
was
reinforced
by
the
fact
that
in
the
first
few
rows
to
the
left
and
the
right
of
him
there
was
hardly
any
face
looking
in
his
direction
he
saw
nothing
but
the
backs
of
people
directing
their
speech
and
their
movements
only
towards
members
of
their
own
side
most
of
them
were
dressed
in
black
in
old
long
formal
frock
coats
that
hung
down
loosely
around
them
these
clothes
were
the
only
thing
that
puzzled
as
he
would
otherwise
have
taken
the
whole
assembly
for
a
local
political
meeting
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
where
had
been
led
there
was
a
little
table
set
at
an
angle
on
a
very
low
podium
which
was
as
overcrowded
as
everywhere
else
and
behind
the
table
near
the
edge
of
the
podium
sat
a
small
fat
wheezing
man
who
was
talking
with
someone
behind
him
this
second
man
was
standing
with
his
legs
crossed
and
his
elbows
on
the
backrest
of
the
chair
provoking
much
laughter
from
time
to
time
he
threw
his
arm
in
the
air
as
if
doing
a
caricature
of
someone
the
youth
who
was
leading
had
some
difficulty
in
reporting
to
the
man
he
had
already
tried
twice
to
tell
him
something
standing
on
toe
but
without
getting
the
man
attention
as
he
sat
there
above
him
it
was
only
when
one
of
the
people
up
on
the
podium
drew
his
attention
to
the
youth
that
the
man
turned
to
him
and
leant
down
to
hear
what
it
was
he
quietly
said
then
he
pulled
out
his
watch
and
quickly
looked
over
at
you
should
have
been
here
one
hour
and
five
minutes
ago
he
said
was
going
to
give
him
a
reply
but
had
no
time
to
do
so
as
hardly
had
the
man
spoken
than
a
general
muttering
arose
all
over
the
right
hand
side
of
the
hall
you
should
have
been
here
one
hour
and
five
minutes
ago
the
man
now
repeated
raising
his
voice
this
time
and
quickly
looked
round
the
hall
beneath
him
the
muttering
also
became
immediately
louder
and
as
the
man
said
nothing
more
died
away
only
gradually
now
the
hall
was
much
quieter
than
when
had
entered
only
the
people
up
in
the
gallery
had
not
stopped
passing
remarks
as
far
as
could
be
distinguished
up
in
the
dust
and
haze
they
seemed
to
be
less
well
dressed
than
those
below
many
of
them
had
brought
pillows
that
they
had
put
between
their
heads
and
the
ceiling
so
that
they
would
not
hurt
themselves
pressed
against
it
had
decided
he
would
do
more
watching
than
talking
so
he
did
not
defend
himself
for
supposedly
having
come
late
and
simply
said
well
maybe
i
have
arrived
late
i
here
now
there
followed
loud
applause
once
more
from
the
right
hand
side
of
the
hall
easy
people
to
get
on
your
side
thought
and
was
bothered
only
by
the
quiet
from
the
left
hand
side
which
was
directly
behind
him
and
from
which
there
was
applause
from
only
a
few
individuals
he
wondered
what
he
could
say
to
get
all
of
them
to
support
him
together
or
if
that
were
not
possible
to
at
least
get
the
support
of
the
others
for
a
while
yes
said
the
man
but
i
now
no
longer
under
any
obligation
to
hear
your
case
there
was
once
more
a
muttering
but
this
time
it
was
misleading
as
the
man
waved
the
people
objections
aside
with
his
hand
and
continued
i
will
however
as
an
exception
continue
with
it
today
but
you
should
never
arrive
late
like
this
again
and
now
step
forward
someone
jumped
down
from
the
podium
so
that
there
would
be
a
place
free
for
and
stepped
up
onto
it
he
stood
pressed
closely
against
the
table
the
press
of
the
crowd
behind
him
was
so
great
that
he
had
to
press
back
against
it
if
he
did
not
want
to
push
the
desk
down
off
the
podium
and
perhaps
the
judge
along
with
it
the
judge
however
paid
no
attention
to
that
but
sat
very
comfortably
on
his
chair
and
after
saying
a
few
words
to
close
his
discussion
with
the
man
behind
him
reached
for
a
little
note
book
the
only
item
on
his
desk
it
was
like
an
old
school
exercise
book
and
had
become
quite
misshapen
from
much
thumbing
now
then
said
the
judge
thumbing
through
the
book
he
turned
to
with
the
tone
of
someone
who
knows
his
facts
and
said
you
are
a
house
painter
no
said
i
am
the
chief
clerk
in
a
large
bank
this
reply
was
followed
by
laughter
among
the
right
hand
faction
down
in
the
hall
it
was
so
hearty
that
could
stop
himself
joining
in
with
it
the
people
supported
themselves
with
their
hands
on
their
knees
and
shook
as
if
suffering
a
serious
attack
of
coughing
even
some
of
those
in
the
gallery
were
laughing
the
judge
had
become
quite
cross
but
seemed
to
have
no
power
over
those
below
him
in
the
hall
he
tried
to
reduce
what
harm
had
been
done
in
the
gallery
and
jumped
up
threatening
them
his
eyebrows
until
then
hardly
remarkable
pushed
themselves
up
and
became
big
black
and
bushy
over
his
eyes
the
left
hand
side
of
the
hall
was
still
quiet
though
the
people
stood
there
in
rows
with
their
faces
looking
towards
the
podium
listening
to
what
was
being
said
there
they
observed
the
noise
from
the
other
side
of
the
hall
with
the
same
quietness
and
even
allowed
some
individuals
from
their
own
ranks
here
and
there
to
go
forward
into
the
other
faction
the
people
in
the
left
faction
were
not
only
fewer
in
number
than
the
right
but
probably
were
no
more
important
than
them
although
their
behaviour
was
calmer
and
that
made
it
seem
like
they
were
when
now
began
to
speak
he
was
convinced
he
was
doing
it
in
the
same
way
as
them
your
question
my
lord
as
to
whether
i
am
a
house
painter
in
fact
even
more
than
that
you
did
not
ask
at
all
but
merely
imposed
it
on
me
is
symptomatic
of
the
whole
way
these
proceedings
against
me
are
being
carried
out
perhaps
you
will
object
that
there
are
no
proceedings
against
me
you
will
be
quite
right
as
there
are
proceedings
only
if
i
acknowledge
that
there
are
but
for
the
moment
i
do
acknowledge
it
out
of
pity
for
yourselves
to
a
large
extent
impossible
not
to
observe
all
this
business
without
feeling
pity
i
do
say
things
are
being
done
without
due
care
but
i
would
like
to
make
it
clear
that
it
is
i
who
make
the
acknowledgement
stopped
speaking
and
looked
down
into
the
hall
he
had
spoken
sharply
more
sharply
than
he
had
intended
but
he
had
been
quite
right
it
should
have
been
rewarded
with
some
applause
here
and
there
but
everything
was
quiet
they
were
all
clearly
waiting
for
what
would
follow
perhaps
the
quietness
was
laying
the
ground
for
an
outbreak
of
activity
that
would
bring
this
whole
affair
to
an
end
it
was
somewhat
disturbing
that
just
then
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
hall
opened
the
young
washerwoman
who
seemed
to
have
finished
her
work
came
in
and
despite
all
her
caution
attracted
the
attention
of
some
of
the
people
there
it
was
only
the
judge
who
gave
any
direct
pleasure
as
he
seemed
to
have
been
immediately
struck
by
words
until
then
he
had
listened
to
him
standing
as
speech
had
taken
him
by
surprise
while
he
was
directing
his
attention
to
the
gallery
now
in
the
pause
he
sat
down
very
slowly
as
if
he
did
not
want
anyone
to
notice
he
took
out
the
notebook
again
probably
so
that
he
could
give
the
impression
of
being
calmer
that
wo
help
you
sir
continued
even
your
little
book
will
only
confirm
what
i
say
was
satisfied
to
hear
nothing
but
his
own
quiet
words
in
this
room
full
of
strangers
and
he
even
dared
casually
to
pick
up
the
examining
judge
notebook
and
touching
it
only
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
as
if
it
were
something
revolting
lifted
it
in
the
air
holding
it
just
by
one
of
the
middle
pages
so
that
the
others
on
each
side
of
it
closely
written
blotted
and
yellowing
flapped
down
those
are
the
official
notes
of
the
examining
judge
he
said
and
let
the
notebook
fall
down
onto
the
desk
you
can
read
in
your
book
as
much
as
you
like
sir
i
really
do
have
anything
in
this
charge
book
to
be
afraid
of
even
though
i
do
have
access
to
it
as
i
would
want
it
in
my
hand
i
can
only
touch
it
with
two
fingers
the
judge
grabbed
the
notebook
from
where
it
had
fallen
on
the
desk
which
could
only
have
been
a
sign
of
his
deep
humiliation
or
at
least
that
is
how
it
must
have
been
perceived
tried
to
tidy
it
up
a
little
and
held
it
once
more
in
front
of
himself
in
order
to
read
from
it
the
people
in
the
front
row
looked
up
at
him
showing
such
tension
on
their
faces
that
he
looked
back
down
at
them
for
some
time
every
one
of
them
was
an
old
man
some
of
them
with
white
beards
could
they
perhaps
be
the
crucial
group
who
could
turn
the
whole
assembly
one
way
or
the
other
they
had
sunk
into
a
state
of
motionlessness
while
gave
his
oration
and
it
had
not
been
possible
to
raise
them
from
this
passivity
even
when
the
judge
was
being
humiliated
what
has
happened
to
me
continued
with
less
of
the
vigour
he
had
had
earlier
he
continually
scanned
the
faces
in
the
first
row
and
this
gave
his
address
a
somewhat
nervous
and
distracted
character
what
has
happened
to
me
is
not
just
an
isolated
case
if
it
were
it
would
not
be
of
much
importance
as
it
not
of
much
importance
to
me
but
it
is
a
symptom
of
proceedings
which
are
carried
out
against
many
it
on
behalf
of
them
that
i
stand
here
now
not
for
myself
alone
without
having
intended
it
he
had
raised
his
voice
somewhere
in
the
hall
someone
raised
his
hands
and
applauded
him
shouting
bravo
why
not
then
bravo
again
i
say
bravo
some
of
the
men
in
the
first
row
groped
around
in
their
beards
none
of
them
looked
round
to
see
who
was
shouting
not
even
thought
him
of
any
importance
but
it
did
raise
his
spirits
he
no
longer
thought
it
at
all
necessary
that
all
of
those
in
the
hall
should
applaud
him
it
was
enough
if
the
majority
of
them
began
to
think
about
the
matter
and
if
only
one
of
them
now
and
then
was
persuaded
i
not
trying
to
be
a
successful
orator
said
after
this
thought
that
probably
more
than
i
capable
of
anyway
i
sure
the
examining
judge
can
speak
far
better
than
i
can
it
is
part
of
his
job
after
all
all
that
i
want
is
a
public
discussion
of
a
public
wrong
listen
ten
days
ago
i
was
placed
under
arrest
the
arrest
itself
is
something
i
laugh
about
but
that
beside
the
point
they
came
for
me
in
the
morning
when
i
was
still
in
bed
maybe
the
order
had
been
given
to
arrest
some
house
painter
that
seems
possible
after
what
the
judge
has
said
someone
who
is
as
innocent
as
i
am
but
it
was
me
they
chose
there
were
two
police
thugs
occupying
the
next
room
they
could
not
have
taken
better
precautions
if
i
had
been
a
dangerous
robber
and
these
policemen
were
unprincipled
they
talked
at
me
till
i
was
sick
of
it
they
wanted
bribes
they
wanted
to
trick
me
into
giving
them
my
clothes
they
wanted
money
supposedly
so
that
they
could
bring
me
my
breakfast
after
they
had
blatantly
eaten
my
own
breakfast
in
front
of
my
eyes
and
even
that
was
not
enough
i
was
led
in
front
of
the
supervisor
in
another
room
this
was
the
room
of
a
lady
who
i
have
a
lot
of
respect
for
and
i
was
forced
to
look
on
while
the
supervisor
and
the
policemen
made
quite
a
mess
of
this
room
because
of
me
although
not
through
any
fault
of
mine
it
was
not
easy
to
stay
calm
but
i
managed
to
do
so
and
was
completely
calm
when
i
asked
the
supervisor
why
it
was
that
i
was
under
arrest
if
he
were
here
he
would
have
to
confirm
what
i
say
i
can
see
him
now
sitting
on
the
chair
belonging
to
that
lady
i
mentioned
a
picture
of
arrogance
what
do
you
think
he
answered
what
he
told
me
gentlemen
was
basically
nothing
at
all
perhaps
he
really
did
know
nothing
he
had
placed
me
under
arrest
and
was
satisfied
in
fact
he
had
done
more
than
that
and
brought
three
junior
employees
from
the
bank
where
i
work
into
the
lady
room
they
had
made
themselves
busy
interfering
with
some
photographs
that
belonged
to
the
lady
and
causing
a
mess
there
was
of
course
another
reason
for
bringing
these
employees
they
just
like
my
landlady
and
her
maid
were
expected
to
spread
the
news
of
my
arrest
and
damage
my
public
reputation
and
in
particular
to
remove
me
from
my
position
at
the
bank
well
they
did
succeed
in
any
of
that
not
in
the
slightest
even
my
landlady
who
is
quite
a
simple
person
and
i
will
give
you
here
her
name
in
full
respect
her
name
is
grubach
even
grubach
was
understanding
enough
to
see
that
an
arrest
like
this
has
no
more
significance
than
an
attack
carried
out
on
the
street
by
some
youths
who
are
not
kept
under
proper
control
i
repeat
this
whole
affair
has
caused
me
nothing
but
unpleasantness
and
temporary
irritation
but
could
it
not
also
have
had
some
far
worse
consequences
broke
off
here
and
looked
at
the
judge
who
said
nothing
as
he
did
so
he
thought
he
saw
the
judge
use
a
movement
of
his
eyes
to
give
a
sign
to
someone
in
the
crowd
smiled
and
said
and
now
the
judge
right
next
to
me
is
giving
a
secret
sign
to
someone
among
you
there
seems
to
be
someone
among
you
who
is
taking
directions
from
above
i
do
know
whether
the
sign
is
meant
to
produce
booing
or
applause
but
i
resist
trying
to
guess
what
its
meaning
is
too
soon
it
really
does
matter
to
me
and
i
give
his
lordship
the
judge
my
full
and
public
permission
to
stop
giving
secret
signs
to
his
paid
subordinate
down
there
and
give
his
orders
in
words
instead
let
him
just
say
boo
now
and
then
the
next
time
clap
now
whether
it
was
embarrassment
or
impatience
the
judge
rocked
backwards
and
forwards
on
his
seat
the
man
behind
him
whom
he
had
been
talking
with
earlier
leant
forward
again
either
to
give
him
a
few
general
words
of
encouragement
or
some
specific
piece
of
advice
below
them
in
the
hall
the
people
talked
to
each
other
quietly
but
animatedly
the
two
factions
had
earlier
seemed
to
hold
views
strongly
opposed
to
each
other
but
now
they
began
to
intermingle
a
few
individuals
pointed
up
at
others
pointed
at
the
judge
the
air
in
the
room
was
fuggy
and
extremely
oppressive
those
who
were
standing
furthest
away
could
hardly
even
be
seen
through
it
it
must
have
been
especially
troublesome
for
those
visitors
who
were
in
the
gallery
as
they
were
forced
to
quietly
ask
the
participants
in
the
assembly
what
exactly
was
happening
albeit
with
timid
glances
at
the
judge
the
replies
they
received
were
just
as
quiet
and
given
behind
the
protection
of
a
raised
hand
i
have
nearly
finished
what
i
have
to
say
said
and
as
there
was
no
bell
available
he
struck
the
desk
with
his
fist
in
a
way
that
startled
the
judge
and
his
advisor
and
made
them
look
up
from
each
other
none
of
this
concerns
me
and
i
am
therefore
able
to
make
a
calm
assessment
of
it
and
assuming
that
this
court
is
of
any
real
importance
it
will
be
very
much
to
your
advantage
to
listen
to
what
i
have
to
say
if
you
want
to
discuss
what
i
say
please
do
bother
to
write
it
down
until
later
on
i
do
have
any
time
to
waste
and
soon
be
leaving
there
was
immediate
silence
which
showed
how
well
was
in
control
of
the
crowd
there
were
no
shouts
among
them
as
there
had
been
at
the
start
even
applauded
but
if
they
were
already
persuaded
they
seemed
very
close
to
it
k
was
pleased
at
the
tension
among
all
the
people
there
as
they
listened
to
him
a
rustling
rose
from
the
silence
which
was
more
invigorating
than
the
most
ecstatic
applause
could
have
been
there
is
no
doubt
he
said
quietly
that
there
is
some
enormous
organisation
determining
what
is
said
by
this
court
in
my
case
this
includes
my
arrest
and
the
examination
taking
place
here
today
an
organisation
that
employs
policemen
who
can
be
bribed
oafish
supervisors
and
judges
of
whom
nothing
better
can
be
said
than
that
they
are
not
as
arrogant
as
some
others
this
organisation
even
maintains
a
judiciary
along
with
its
train
of
countless
servants
scribes
policemen
and
all
the
other
assistance
that
it
needs
perhaps
even
executioners
and
torturers
i
not
afraid
of
using
those
words
and
what
gentlemen
is
the
purpose
of
this
enormous
organisation
its
purpose
is
to
arrest
innocent
people
and
wage
pointless
prosecutions
against
them
which
as
in
my
case
lead
to
no
result
how
are
we
to
avoid
those
in
office
becoming
deeply
corrupt
when
everything
is
devoid
of
meaning
that
is
impossible
not
even
the
highest
judge
would
be
able
to
achieve
that
for
himself
that
is
why
policemen
try
to
steal
the
clothes
off
the
back
of
those
they
arrest
that
is
why
supervisors
break
into
the
homes
of
people
they
do
not
know
that
is
why
innocent
people
are
humiliated
in
front
of
crowds
rather
than
being
given
a
proper
trial
the
policemen
only
talked
about
the
warehouses
where
they
put
the
property
of
those
they
arrest
i
would
like
to
see
these
warehouses
where
the
hard
won
possessions
of
people
under
arrest
is
left
to
decay
if
that
is
not
stolen
by
the
thieving
hands
of
the
warehouse
workers
was
interrupted
by
a
screeching
from
the
far
end
of
the
hall
he
shaded
his
eyes
to
see
that
far
as
the
dull
light
of
day
made
the
smoke
whitish
and
hard
to
see
through
it
was
the
washerwoman
whom
had
recognised
as
a
likely
source
of
disturbance
as
soon
as
she
had
entered
it
was
hard
to
see
now
whether
it
was
her
fault
or
not
could
only
see
that
a
man
had
pulled
her
into
a
corner
by
the
door
and
was
pressing
himself
against
her
but
it
was
not
her
who
was
screaming
but
the
man
he
had
opened
his
mouth
wide
and
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
a
small
circle
had
formed
around
the
two
of
them
the
visitors
near
him
in
the
gallery
seemed
delighted
that
the
serious
tone
had
introduced
into
the
gathering
had
been
disturbed
in
this
way
first
thought
was
to
run
over
there
and
he
also
thought
that
everyone
would
want
to
bring
things
back
into
order
there
or
at
least
to
make
the
pair
leave
the
room
but
the
first
row
of
people
in
front
of
him
stayed
were
they
were
moved
and
let
through
on
the
contrary
they
stood
in
his
way
old
men
held
out
their
arms
in
front
of
him
and
a
hand
from
somewhere
he
did
not
have
the
time
to
turn
round
took
hold
of
his
collar
by
this
time
had
forgotten
about
the
pair
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
freedom
was
being
limited
as
if
his
arrest
was
being
taken
seriously
and
without
any
thought
for
what
he
was
doing
he
jumped
down
from
the
podium
now
he
stood
face
to
face
with
the
crowd
had
he
judged
the
people
properly
had
he
put
too
much
faith
in
the
effect
of
his
speech
had
they
been
putting
up
a
pretence
all
the
time
he
had
been
speaking
and
now
that
he
come
to
the
end
and
to
what
must
follow
were
they
tired
of
pretending
what
faces
they
were
all
around
him
dark
little
eyes
flickered
here
and
there
cheeks
drooped
down
like
on
drunken
men
their
long
beards
were
thin
and
stiff
if
they
took
hold
of
them
it
was
more
like
they
were
making
their
hands
into
claws
not
as
if
they
were
taking
hold
of
their
own
beards
but
underneath
those
beards
and
this
was
the
real
discovery
made
by
there
were
badges
of
various
sizes
and
colours
shining
on
the
collars
of
their
coats
as
far
as
he
could
see
every
one
of
them
was
wearing
one
of
these
badges
all
of
them
belonged
to
the
same
group
even
though
they
seemed
to
be
divided
to
the
right
and
the
left
of
him
and
when
he
suddenly
turned
round
he
saw
the
same
badge
on
the
collar
of
the
examining
judge
who
calmly
looked
down
at
him
with
his
hands
in
his
lap
so
called
out
k
throwing
his
arms
in
the
air
as
if
this
sudden
realisation
needed
more
room
all
of
you
are
working
for
this
organisation
i
see
now
that
you
are
all
the
very
bunch
of
cheats
and
liars
i
just
been
speaking
about
you
all
pressed
yourselves
in
here
in
order
to
listen
in
and
snoop
on
me
you
gave
the
impression
of
having
formed
into
factions
one
of
you
even
applauded
me
to
test
me
out
and
you
wanted
to
learn
how
to
trap
an
innocent
man
well
i
hope
you
have
come
here
for
nothing
i
hope
you
either
had
some
fun
from
someone
who
expected
you
to
defend
his
innocence
or
else
let
go
of
me
or
i
hit
you
shouted
to
a
quivery
old
man
who
had
pressed
himself
especially
close
to
him
or
else
that
you
actually
learned
something
and
so
i
wish
you
good
luck
in
your
trade
he
briskly
took
his
hat
from
where
it
lay
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
surrounded
by
a
silence
caused
perhaps
by
the
completeness
of
their
surprise
pushed
his
way
to
the
exit
however
the
examining
judge
seems
to
have
moved
even
more
quickly
than
as
he
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
doorway
one
moment
he
said
stood
where
he
was
but
looked
at
the
door
with
his
hand
already
on
its
handle
rather
than
at
the
judge
i
merely
wanted
to
draw
your
attention
said
the
judge
to
something
you
seem
not
yet
to
be
aware
of
today
you
have
robbed
yourself
of
the
advantages
that
a
hearing
of
this
sort
always
gives
to
someone
who
is
under
arrest
laughed
towards
the
door
you
bunch
of
louts
he
called
you
can
keep
all
your
hearings
as
a
present
from
me
then
opened
the
door
and
hurried
down
the
steps
behind
him
the
noise
of
the
assembly
rose
as
it
became
lively
once
more
and
probably
began
to
discuss
these
events
as
if
making
a
scientific
study
of
them
chapter
three
in
the
empty
courtroom
the
student
the
offices
every
day
over
the
following
week
expected
another
summons
to
arrive
he
could
not
believe
that
his
rejection
of
any
more
hearings
had
been
taken
literally
and
when
the
expected
summons
really
had
not
come
by
saturday
evening
he
took
it
to
mean
that
he
was
expected
without
being
told
to
appear
at
the
same
place
at
the
same
time
so
on
sunday
he
set
out
once
more
in
the
same
direction
going
without
hesitation
up
the
steps
and
through
the
corridors
some
of
the
people
remembered
him
and
greeted
him
from
their
doorways
but
he
no
longer
needed
to
ask
anyone
the
way
and
soon
arrived
at
the
right
door
it
was
opened
as
soon
as
he
knocked
and
paying
no
attention
to
the
woman
he
had
seen
last
time
who
was
standing
at
the
doorway
he
was
about
to
go
straight
into
the
adjoining
room
when
she
said
to
him
there
no
session
today
what
do
you
mean
no
session
he
asked
unable
to
believe
it
but
the
woman
persuaded
him
by
opening
the
door
to
the
next
room
it
was
indeed
empty
and
looked
even
more
dismal
empty
than
it
had
the
previous
sunday
on
the
podium
stood
the
table
exactly
as
it
had
been
before
with
a
few
books
laying
on
it
can
i
have
a
look
at
those
books
asked
not
because
he
was
especially
curious
but
so
that
he
would
not
have
come
for
nothing
no
said
the
woman
as
she
the
door
that
not
allowed
those
books
belong
to
the
examining
judge
i
see
said
and
nodded
those
books
must
be
law
books
and
how
this
court
does
things
not
only
to
try
people
who
are
innocent
but
even
to
try
them
without
letting
them
know
what
going
on
i
expect
you
right
said
the
woman
who
had
not
understood
exactly
what
he
meant
i
better
go
away
again
then
said
should
i
give
a
message
to
the
examining
judge
asked
the
woman
do
you
know
him
then
asked
of
course
i
know
him
said
the
woman
my
husband
is
the
court
usher
it
was
only
now
that
noticed
that
the
room
which
before
had
held
nothing
but
a
had
been
fitted
out
as
a
living
room
the
woman
saw
how
surprised
he
was
and
said
yes
we
allowed
to
live
here
as
we
like
only
we
have
to
clear
the
room
out
when
the
court
in
session
there
lots
of
disadvantages
to
my
husband
job
it
not
so
much
the
room
that
surprises
me
said
looking
at
her
crossly
it
your
being
married
that
shocks
me
are
you
thinking
about
what
happened
last
time
the
court
was
in
session
when
i
disturbed
what
you
were
saying
asked
the
woman
of
course
said
it
in
the
past
now
and
i
nearly
forgotten
about
it
but
at
the
time
it
made
me
furious
and
now
you
tell
me
yourself
that
you
are
a
married
woman
it
was
any
disadvantage
for
you
to
have
your
speech
interrupted
the
way
they
talked
about
you
after
gone
was
really
bad
that
could
well
be
said
turning
away
but
it
does
not
excuse
you
there
i
know
who
hold
it
against
me
said
the
woman
him
who
put
his
arms
around
me
he
been
chasing
after
me
for
a
long
time
i
might
not
be
very
attractive
for
most
people
but
i
am
for
him
i
got
no
protection
from
him
even
my
husband
has
had
to
get
used
to
it
if
he
wants
to
keep
his
job
he
got
to
put
up
with
it
as
that
man
a
student
and
he
almost
certainly
be
very
powerful
later
on
he
always
after
me
he
only
just
left
when
you
arrived
that
fits
in
with
everything
else
said
i
not
surprised
do
you
want
to
make
things
a
bit
better
here
the
woman
asked
slowly
watching
him
as
if
she
were
saying
something
that
could
be
as
dangerous
for
as
for
herself
that
what
i
thought
when
i
heard
you
speak
i
really
liked
what
you
said
mind
you
i
only
heard
part
of
it
i
missed
the
beginning
of
it
and
at
the
end
i
was
lying
on
the
floor
with
the
student
it
so
horrible
here
she
said
after
a
pause
and
took
hold
of
hand
do
you
believe
you
really
will
be
able
to
make
things
better
smiled
and
twisted
his
hand
round
a
little
in
her
soft
hands
it
really
not
my
job
to
make
things
better
here
as
you
put
it
he
said
and
if
you
said
that
to
the
examining
judge
he
would
laugh
at
you
or
punish
you
for
it
i
really
would
not
have
become
involved
in
this
matter
if
i
could
have
helped
it
and
i
would
have
lost
no
sleep
worrying
about
how
this
court
needs
to
be
made
better
but
because
i
told
that
i
have
been
arrested
and
i
am
under
arrest
it
forces
me
to
take
some
action
and
to
do
so
for
my
own
sake
however
if
i
can
be
of
some
service
to
you
in
the
process
i
will
of
course
be
glad
to
do
so
and
i
will
be
glad
to
do
so
not
only
for
the
sake
of
charity
but
also
because
you
can
be
of
some
help
to
me
how
could
i
help
you
then
said
the
woman
you
could
for
example
show
me
the
books
on
the
table
there
yes
certainly
the
woman
cried
and
pulled
along
behind
her
as
she
rushed
to
them
the
books
were
old
and
well
worn
the
cover
of
one
of
them
had
nearly
broken
through
in
its
middle
and
it
was
held
together
with
a
few
threads
everything
is
so
dirty
here
said
shaking
his
head
and
before
he
could
pick
the
books
up
the
woman
wiped
some
of
the
dust
off
with
her
apron
took
hold
of
the
book
that
lay
on
top
and
threw
it
open
an
indecent
picture
appeared
a
man
and
a
woman
sat
naked
on
a
sofa
the
base
intent
of
whoever
drew
it
was
easy
to
see
but
he
had
been
so
grossly
lacking
in
skill
that
all
that
anyone
could
really
make
out
were
the
man
and
the
woman
who
dominated
the
picture
with
their
bodies
sitting
in
overly
upright
postures
that
created
a
false
perspective
and
made
it
difficult
for
them
to
approach
each
other
did
thumb
through
that
book
any
more
but
just
threw
open
the
next
one
at
its
title
page
it
was
a
novel
with
the
title
what
grete
suffered
from
her
husband
hans
so
this
is
the
sort
of
law
book
they
study
here
said
this
is
the
sort
of
person
sitting
in
judgement
over
me
i
can
help
you
said
the
woman
would
you
like
me
to
could
you
really
do
that
without
placing
yourself
in
danger
you
did
say
earlier
on
that
your
husband
is
wholly
dependent
on
his
superiors
i
still
want
to
help
you
said
the
woman
come
over
here
we
got
to
talk
about
it
do
say
any
more
about
what
danger
i
in
i
only
fear
danger
where
i
want
to
fear
it
come
over
here
she
pointed
to
the
podium
and
invited
him
to
sit
down
on
the
step
with
her
you
got
lovely
dark
eyes
she
said
after
they
had
sat
down
looking
up
into
face
people
say
i
got
nice
eyes
too
but
yours
are
much
nicer
it
was
the
first
thing
i
noticed
when
you
first
came
here
that
even
why
i
came
in
here
into
the
assembly
room
afterwards
i
never
normally
do
that
i
not
really
even
allowed
to
so
that
what
all
this
is
about
thought
offering
herself
to
me
she
as
degenerate
as
everything
else
around
here
she
had
enough
of
the
court
officials
which
is
understandable
i
suppose
and
so
she
approaches
any
stranger
and
makes
compliments
about
his
eyes
with
that
stood
up
in
silence
as
if
he
had
spoken
his
thoughts
out
loud
and
thus
explained
his
action
to
the
woman
i
think
you
can
be
of
any
assistance
to
me
he
said
to
be
of
any
real
assistance
you
would
need
to
be
in
contact
with
high
officials
but
sure
you
only
know
the
lower
employees
and
there
are
crowds
of
them
milling
about
here
i
sure
you
very
familiar
with
them
and
could
achieve
a
great
deal
through
them
i
no
doubt
of
that
but
the
most
that
could
be
done
through
them
would
have
no
bearing
at
all
on
the
final
outcome
of
the
trial
you
on
the
other
hand
would
lose
some
of
your
friends
as
a
result
and
i
have
no
wish
of
that
carry
on
with
these
people
in
the
same
way
as
you
have
been
as
it
does
seem
to
me
to
be
something
you
can
not
do
without
i
have
no
regrets
in
saying
this
as
in
return
for
your
compliment
to
me
i
also
find
you
rather
attractive
especially
when
you
look
at
me
as
sadly
as
you
are
now
although
you
really
have
no
reason
to
do
so
you
belong
to
the
people
i
have
to
combat
and
you
very
comfortable
among
them
you
even
in
love
with
the
student
or
if
you
do
love
him
you
do
at
least
prefer
him
to
your
husband
it
easy
to
see
that
from
what
you
been
saying
no
she
shouted
remained
sitting
where
she
was
and
grasped
hand
which
he
failed
to
pull
away
fast
enough
you
ca
go
away
now
you
ca
go
away
when
you
misjudged
me
like
that
are
you
really
capable
of
going
away
now
am
i
really
so
worthless
that
you
wo
even
do
me
the
favour
of
staying
a
little
bit
longer
you
misunderstand
me
said
sitting
back
down
if
it
really
important
to
you
for
me
to
stay
here
then
i
be
glad
to
do
so
i
have
plenty
of
time
i
came
here
thinking
there
would
be
a
trial
taking
place
all
i
meant
with
what
i
said
just
now
was
to
ask
you
not
to
do
anything
on
my
behalf
in
the
proceedings
against
me
but
even
that
is
nothing
for
you
to
worry
about
when
you
consider
that
there
nothing
hanging
on
the
outcome
of
this
trial
and
that
whatever
the
verdict
i
will
just
laugh
at
it
and
that
even
presupposing
it
ever
even
reaches
any
conclusion
which
i
very
much
doubt
i
think
it
much
more
likely
that
the
court
officials
will
be
too
lazy
too
forgetful
or
even
to
fearful
ever
to
continue
with
these
proceedings
and
that
they
will
soon
be
abandoned
if
they
have
been
abandoned
already
it
even
possible
that
they
will
pretend
to
be
carrying
on
with
the
trial
in
the
hope
of
receiving
a
large
bribe
although
i
can
tell
you
now
that
that
will
be
quite
in
vain
as
i
pay
bribes
to
perhaps
one
favour
you
could
do
me
would
be
to
tell
the
examining
judge
or
anyone
else
who
likes
to
spread
important
news
that
i
will
never
be
induced
to
pay
any
sort
of
bribe
through
any
stratagem
of
theirs
and
i
sure
they
have
many
stratagems
at
their
disposal
there
is
no
prospect
of
that
you
can
tell
them
that
quite
openly
and
what
more
i
expect
they
have
already
noticed
themselves
or
even
if
they
have
this
affair
is
really
not
so
important
to
me
as
they
think
those
gentlemen
would
only
save
some
work
for
themselves
or
at
least
some
unpleasantness
for
me
which
however
i
am
glad
to
endure
if
i
know
that
each
piece
of
unpleasantness
for
me
is
a
blow
against
them
and
i
will
make
quite
sure
it
is
a
blow
against
them
do
you
actually
know
the
judge
course
i
do
said
the
woman
he
was
the
first
one
i
thought
of
when
i
offered
to
help
you
i
did
know
he
only
a
minor
official
but
if
you
say
so
it
must
be
true
mind
you
i
still
think
the
report
he
gives
to
his
superiors
must
have
some
influence
and
he
writes
so
many
reports
you
say
these
officials
are
lazy
but
they
certainly
not
all
lazy
especially
this
examining
judge
he
writes
ever
such
a
lot
last
sunday
for
instance
that
session
went
on
till
the
evening
everyone
had
gone
but
the
examining
judge
he
stayed
in
the
hall
i
had
to
bring
him
a
lamp
in
all
i
had
was
a
little
kitchen
lamp
but
he
was
very
satisfied
with
it
and
started
to
write
straight
away
meantime
my
husband
arrived
he
always
has
the
day
off
on
sundays
we
got
the
furniture
back
in
and
got
our
room
sorted
out
and
then
a
few
of
the
neighbours
came
we
sat
and
talked
for
a
bit
by
a
candle
in
short
we
forgot
all
about
the
examining
judge
and
went
to
bed
all
of
a
sudden
in
the
night
it
must
have
been
quite
late
in
the
night
i
wakes
up
next
to
the
bed
there
the
examining
judge
shading
the
lamp
with
his
hand
so
that
there
no
light
from
it
falls
on
my
husband
he
need
to
be
as
careful
as
that
the
way
my
husband
sleeps
the
light
would
have
woken
him
up
anyway
i
was
quite
shocked
and
nearly
screamed
but
the
judge
was
very
friendly
warned
me
i
should
be
careful
he
whispered
to
me
he
been
writing
all
this
time
and
now
he
brought
me
the
lamp
back
and
he
never
forget
how
i
looked
when
he
found
me
there
asleep
what
i
mean
with
all
this
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
how
the
examining
judge
really
does
write
lots
of
reports
especially
about
you
as
questioning
you
was
definitely
one
of
the
main
things
on
the
agenda
that
sunday
if
he
writes
reports
as
long
as
that
they
must
be
of
some
importance
and
besides
all
that
you
can
see
from
what
happened
that
the
examining
judge
is
after
me
and
it
right
now
when
he
first
begun
to
notice
me
that
i
can
have
a
lot
of
influence
on
him
and
i
got
other
proof
i
mean
a
lot
to
him
too
yesterday
he
sent
that
student
to
me
the
one
he
really
trusts
and
who
he
works
with
he
sent
him
with
a
present
for
me
silk
stockings
he
said
it
was
because
i
clear
up
in
the
courtroom
but
that
only
a
pretence
that
job
no
more
than
what
i
supposed
to
do
it
what
my
husband
gets
paid
for
nice
stockings
they
are
look
she
stretched
out
her
leg
drew
her
skirt
up
to
her
knee
and
looked
herself
at
the
stocking
they
are
nice
stockings
but
they
too
good
for
me
really
she
suddenly
interrupted
herself
and
lay
her
hand
on
as
if
she
wanted
to
calm
him
down
and
whispered
be
quiet
berthold
is
watching
us
slowly
looked
up
in
the
doorway
to
the
courtroom
stood
a
young
man
he
was
short
his
legs
were
not
quite
straight
and
he
continually
moved
his
finger
round
in
a
short
thin
red
beard
with
which
he
hoped
to
make
himself
look
dignified
looked
at
him
with
some
curiosity
he
was
the
first
student
he
had
ever
met
of
the
unfamiliar
discipline
of
jurisprudence
face
to
face
at
least
a
man
who
would
even
most
likely
attain
high
office
one
day
the
student
in
contrast
seemed
to
take
no
notice
of
at
all
he
merely
withdrew
his
finger
from
his
beard
long
enough
to
beckon
to
the
woman
and
went
over
to
the
window
the
woman
leant
over
to
and
whispered
do
be
cross
with
me
please
do
and
please
do
think
ill
of
me
either
i
got
to
go
to
him
now
to
this
horrible
man
just
look
at
his
bent
legs
but
i
come
straight
back
and
then
i
go
with
you
if
you
take
me
i
go
wherever
you
want
you
can
do
whatever
you
like
with
me
i
be
happy
if
i
can
be
away
from
here
for
as
long
as
possible
it
be
best
if
i
could
get
away
from
here
for
good
she
stroked
hand
once
more
jumped
up
and
ran
over
to
the
window
before
he
realised
it
grasped
for
her
hand
but
failed
to
catch
it
he
really
was
attracted
to
the
woman
and
even
after
thinking
hard
about
it
could
find
no
good
reason
why
he
should
not
give
in
to
her
allure
it
briefly
crossed
his
mind
that
the
woman
meant
to
entrap
him
on
behalf
of
the
court
but
that
was
an
objection
he
had
no
difficulty
in
fending
off
in
what
way
could
she
entrap
him
was
he
not
still
free
so
free
that
he
could
crush
the
entire
court
whenever
he
wanted
as
least
where
it
concerned
him
could
he
not
have
that
much
confidence
in
himself
and
her
offer
of
help
sounded
sincere
and
maybe
it
was
quite
worthless
and
maybe
there
was
no
better
revenge
against
the
examining
judge
and
his
cronies
than
to
take
this
woman
from
him
and
have
her
for
himself
maybe
then
after
much
hard
work
writing
dishonest
reports
about
the
judge
would
go
to
the
woman
bed
late
one
night
and
find
it
empty
and
it
would
be
empty
because
she
belonged
to
because
this
woman
at
the
window
this
lush
supple
warm
body
in
its
sombre
clothes
of
rough
heavy
material
belonged
to
him
totally
to
him
and
to
him
alone
once
he
had
settled
his
thoughts
towards
the
woman
in
this
way
he
began
to
find
the
quiet
conversation
at
the
window
was
taking
too
long
he
rapped
on
the
podium
with
his
knuckles
and
then
even
with
his
fist
the
student
briefly
looked
away
from
the
woman
to
glance
at
over
his
shoulder
but
did
allow
himself
to
be
disturbed
in
fact
he
even
pressed
himself
close
to
the
woman
and
put
his
arms
around
her
she
dropped
her
head
down
low
as
if
listening
to
him
carefully
as
she
did
so
he
kissed
her
right
on
the
neck
hardly
even
interrupting
what
he
was
saying
saw
this
as
confirmation
of
the
tyranny
the
student
held
over
the
woman
and
which
she
had
already
complained
about
he
stood
up
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
glancing
sideways
at
the
student
he
wondered
what
would
be
the
quickest
possible
way
to
get
rid
of
him
and
so
it
was
not
unwelcome
to
him
when
the
student
clearly
disturbed
by
and
which
had
now
developed
into
a
stamping
up
and
down
said
to
him
you
do
have
to
stay
here
you
know
if
you
getting
impatient
you
could
have
gone
earlier
would
have
missed
you
in
fact
you
should
have
gone
you
should
have
left
as
quickly
as
possible
as
soon
as
i
got
here
this
comment
could
have
caused
all
possible
rage
to
break
out
between
them
but
also
bore
in
mind
that
this
was
a
prospective
court
official
speaking
to
a
disfavoured
defendant
and
he
might
well
have
been
taking
pride
in
speaking
in
this
way
remained
standing
quite
close
to
him
and
said
with
a
smile
you
quite
right
i
am
impatient
but
the
easiest
way
to
settle
this
impatience
would
be
if
you
left
us
on
the
other
hand
if
you
come
here
to
study
you
are
a
student
i
hear
i
be
quite
happy
to
leave
the
room
to
you
and
go
away
with
the
woman
i
sure
you
still
have
a
lot
of
study
to
do
before
you
made
into
a
judge
it
true
that
i
still
not
all
that
familiar
with
your
branch
of
jurisprudence
but
i
take
it
it
involves
a
lot
more
than
speaking
roughly
and
i
see
you
have
no
shame
in
doing
that
extremely
well
he
should
have
been
allowed
to
move
about
so
freely
said
the
student
as
if
he
wanted
to
give
the
woman
an
explanation
for
insults
that
was
a
mistake
i
told
the
examining
judge
so
he
should
at
least
have
been
detained
in
his
room
between
hearings
sometimes
it
impossible
to
understand
what
the
judge
thinks
he
doing
you
wasting
your
breath
said
then
he
reached
his
hand
out
towards
the
woman
and
said
come
with
me
so
that
it
said
the
student
oh
no
you
not
going
to
get
her
and
with
a
strength
you
would
not
have
expected
from
him
he
glanced
tenderly
at
her
lifted
her
up
on
one
arm
and
his
back
bent
under
the
weight
ran
with
her
to
the
door
in
this
way
he
showed
unmistakeably
that
he
was
to
some
extent
afraid
of
but
he
nonetheless
dared
to
provoke
him
still
further
by
stroking
and
squeezing
the
woman
arm
with
his
free
hand
ran
the
few
steps
up
to
him
but
when
he
had
reached
him
and
was
about
to
take
hold
of
him
and
if
necessary
throttle
him
the
woman
said
it
no
good
it
the
examining
judge
who
sent
for
me
i
dare
go
with
you
this
little
bastard
and
here
she
ran
her
hand
over
the
face
this
little
bastard
wo
let
me
and
you
do
want
to
be
set
free
shouted
laying
his
hand
on
the
student
shoulder
who
then
snapped
at
it
with
his
teeth
no
shouted
the
woman
pushing
away
with
both
hands
no
no
do
do
that
what
think
you
doing
that
be
the
end
of
me
let
go
of
him
please
just
let
go
of
him
he
only
carrying
out
the
judge
orders
he
carrying
me
to
him
let
him
take
you
then
and
i
want
to
see
nothing
more
of
you
said
enraged
by
his
disappointment
and
giving
the
student
a
thump
in
the
back
so
that
he
briefly
stumbled
and
then
glad
that
he
had
not
fallen
immediately
jumped
up
all
the
higher
with
his
burden
followed
them
slowly
he
realised
that
this
was
the
first
unambiguous
setback
he
had
suffered
from
these
people
it
was
of
course
nothing
to
worry
about
he
accepted
the
setback
only
because
he
was
looking
for
a
fight
if
he
stayed
at
home
and
carried
on
with
his
normal
life
he
would
be
a
thousand
times
superior
to
these
people
and
could
get
any
of
them
out
of
his
way
just
with
a
kick
and
he
imagined
the
most
laughable
scene
possible
as
an
example
of
this
if
this
contemptible
student
this
inflated
child
this
redbeard
if
he
were
kneeling
at
bed
wringing
his
hands
and
begging
for
forgiveness
so
enjoyed
imagining
this
scene
that
he
decided
to
take
the
student
along
to
elsa
with
him
if
ever
he
should
get
the
opportunity
was
curious
to
see
where
the
woman
would
be
taken
and
he
hurried
over
to
the
door
the
student
was
not
likely
to
carry
her
through
the
streets
on
his
arm
it
turned
out
that
the
journey
was
far
shorter
directly
opposite
the
flat
there
was
a
narrow
flight
of
wooden
steps
which
probably
led
up
to
the
attic
they
turned
as
they
went
so
that
it
was
not
possible
to
see
where
they
ended
the
student
carried
the
woman
up
these
steps
and
after
the
exertions
of
running
with
her
he
was
soon
groaning
and
moving
very
slowly
the
woman
waved
down
at
and
by
raising
and
lowering
her
shoulders
she
tried
to
show
that
she
was
an
innocent
party
in
this
abduction
although
the
gesture
did
not
show
a
lot
of
regret
watched
her
without
expression
like
a
stranger
he
wanted
to
show
neither
that
he
was
disappointed
nor
that
he
would
easily
get
over
his
disappointment
the
two
of
them
had
disappeared
but
remained
standing
in
the
doorway
he
had
to
accept
that
the
woman
had
not
only
cheated
him
but
that
she
had
also
lied
to
him
when
she
said
she
was
being
taken
to
the
examining
judge
the
examining
judge
certainly
would
be
sitting
and
waiting
in
the
attic
the
wooden
stairs
would
explain
nothing
to
him
however
long
he
stared
at
them
then
noticed
a
small
piece
of
paper
next
to
them
went
across
to
it
and
read
in
a
childish
and
unpractised
hand
entrance
to
the
court
offices
were
the
court
offices
here
in
the
attic
of
this
tenement
then
if
that
was
how
they
were
accommodated
it
did
not
attract
much
respect
and
it
was
some
comfort
for
the
accused
to
realise
how
little
money
this
court
had
at
its
disposal
if
it
had
to
locate
its
offices
in
a
place
where
the
tenants
of
the
building
who
were
themselves
among
the
poorest
of
people
would
throw
their
unneeded
junk
on
the
other
hand
it
was
possible
that
the
officials
had
enough
money
but
that
they
squandered
it
on
themselves
rather
than
use
it
for
the
court
purposes
going
by
experience
of
them
so
far
that
even
seemed
probable
except
that
if
the
court
were
allowed
to
decay
in
that
way
it
would
not
just
humiliate
the
accused
but
also
give
him
more
encouragement
than
if
the
court
were
simply
in
a
state
of
poverty
also
now
understood
that
the
court
was
ashamed
to
summon
those
it
accused
to
the
attic
of
this
building
for
the
initial
hearing
and
why
it
preferred
to
impose
upon
them
in
their
own
homes
what
a
position
it
was
that
found
himself
in
compared
with
the
judge
sitting
up
in
the
attic
at
the
bank
had
a
big
office
with
an
and
had
an
enormous
window
through
which
he
could
look
down
at
the
activity
in
the
square
it
was
true
though
that
he
had
no
secondary
income
from
bribes
and
fraud
and
he
could
tell
a
servant
to
bring
him
a
woman
up
to
the
office
on
his
arm
however
was
quite
willing
to
do
without
such
things
in
this
life
at
least
was
still
looking
at
the
notice
when
a
man
came
up
the
stairs
looked
through
the
open
door
into
the
living
room
where
it
was
also
possible
to
see
the
courtroom
and
finally
asked
whether
he
had
just
seen
a
woman
there
you
the
court
usher
are
you
asked
that
right
said
the
man
oh
yes
you
defendant
i
recognise
you
now
as
well
nice
to
see
you
here
and
he
offered
his
hand
which
was
far
from
what
had
expected
and
when
said
nothing
he
added
no
court
session
planned
for
today
though
i
know
that
said
as
he
looked
at
the
usher
civilian
coat
which
beside
its
ordinary
buttons
displayed
two
gilded
ones
as
the
only
sign
of
his
office
and
seemed
to
have
been
taken
from
an
old
army
officer
coat
i
was
speaking
with
your
wife
a
little
while
ago
she
is
no
longer
here
the
student
has
carried
her
off
to
the
examining
judge
listen
to
this
said
the
usher
they
always
carrying
her
away
from
me
it
sunday
today
and
it
not
part
of
my
job
to
do
any
work
today
but
they
send
me
off
with
some
message
which
is
even
necessary
just
to
get
me
away
from
here
what
they
do
is
they
send
me
off
not
too
far
away
so
that
i
can
still
hope
to
get
back
on
time
if
i
really
hurry
so
off
i
go
running
as
fast
as
i
can
shout
the
message
through
the
crack
in
the
door
of
the
office
i
been
sent
to
so
out
of
breath
they
hardly
be
able
to
understand
it
run
back
here
again
but
the
student
been
even
faster
than
i
have
well
he
got
less
far
to
go
he
only
got
to
run
down
the
steps
if
i
was
so
dependent
on
them
i
have
squashed
the
student
against
the
wall
here
a
long
time
ago
right
here
next
to
the
sign
i
always
dreaming
of
doing
that
just
here
just
above
the
floor
that
where
he
crushed
onto
the
wall
his
arms
stretched
out
his
fingers
spread
apart
his
crooked
legs
twisted
round
into
a
circle
and
blood
squirted
out
all
around
him
it
only
ever
been
a
dream
so
far
though
is
there
nothing
else
you
do
asked
with
a
smile
nothing
that
i
know
of
said
the
usher
and
it
going
to
get
even
worse
now
up
till
now
he
only
been
carrying
her
off
for
himself
now
he
started
carrying
her
off
for
the
judge
and
all
just
like
always
said
he
would
does
your
wife
then
not
share
some
of
the
responsibility
asked
he
had
to
force
himself
as
he
asked
this
question
as
he
too
felt
so
jealous
now
course
she
does
said
the
usher
it
more
her
fault
than
theirs
it
was
her
who
attached
herself
to
him
all
he
did
he
just
chases
after
any
woman
five
flats
in
this
block
alone
where
he
been
thrown
out
after
working
his
way
in
there
and
my
wife
is
the
best
looking
woman
in
the
whole
building
but
it
me
who
not
even
allowed
to
defend
himself
if
that
how
things
are
then
there
nothing
that
can
be
done
said
well
why
not
asked
the
usher
he
a
coward
that
student
if
he
wants
to
lay
a
finger
on
my
wife
all
you
have
to
do
is
give
him
such
a
good
hiding
he
never
dare
do
it
again
but
i
not
allowed
to
do
that
and
nobody
else
is
going
to
do
me
the
favour
as
they
all
afraid
of
his
power
the
only
one
who
could
do
it
is
a
man
like
you
what
how
could
i
do
it
asked
in
astonishment
well
you
facing
a
charge
are
you
said
the
usher
yes
but
that
all
the
more
reason
for
me
to
be
afraid
even
if
he
has
no
influence
on
the
outcome
of
the
trial
he
probably
has
some
on
the
initial
examination
yes
exactly
said
the
usher
as
if
view
had
been
just
as
correct
as
his
own
only
we
do
usually
get
any
trials
heard
here
with
no
hope
at
all
i
am
not
of
the
same
opinion
said
although
that
ought
not
to
prevent
me
from
dealing
with
the
student
if
the
opportunity
arises
i
would
be
very
grateful
to
you
said
the
usher
of
the
court
somewhat
formally
not
really
seeming
to
believe
that
his
highest
wish
could
be
fulfilled
perhaps
continued
perhaps
there
are
some
other
officials
of
yours
here
perhaps
all
of
them
who
would
deserve
the
same
oh
yes
yes
said
the
usher
as
if
this
was
a
matter
of
course
then
he
looked
at
trustingly
which
despite
all
his
friendliness
he
had
not
done
until
then
and
added
they
always
rebelling
but
the
conversation
seemed
to
have
become
a
little
uncomfortable
for
him
as
he
broke
it
off
by
saying
now
i
have
to
report
to
the
office
would
you
like
to
come
with
me
there
nothing
for
me
to
do
there
said
you
be
able
to
have
a
look
at
it
will
take
any
notice
of
you
is
it
worth
seeing
then
asked
hesitatingly
although
he
felt
very
keen
to
go
with
him
well
said
the
usher
i
thought
be
interested
in
it
alright
then
said
finally
i
come
with
you
and
quicker
than
the
usher
himself
he
ran
up
the
steps
at
the
entrance
he
nearly
fell
over
as
behind
the
door
there
was
another
step
they
do
show
much
concern
for
the
public
he
said
they
do
show
any
concern
at
all
said
the
usher
just
look
at
the
waiting
room
here
it
consisted
of
a
long
corridor
from
which
roughly
made
doors
led
out
to
the
separate
departments
of
the
attic
there
was
no
direct
source
of
light
but
it
was
not
entirely
dark
as
many
of
the
departments
instead
of
solid
walls
had
just
wooden
bars
reaching
up
to
the
ceiling
to
separate
them
from
the
corridor
the
light
made
its
way
in
through
them
and
it
was
also
possible
to
see
individual
officials
through
them
as
they
sat
writing
at
their
desks
or
stood
up
at
the
wooden
frameworks
and
watched
the
people
on
the
corridor
through
the
gaps
there
were
only
a
few
people
in
the
corridor
probably
because
it
was
sunday
they
were
not
very
impressive
they
sat
equally
spaced
on
two
rows
of
long
wooden
benches
which
had
been
placed
along
both
sides
of
the
corridor
all
of
them
were
carelessly
dressed
although
the
expressions
on
their
faces
their
bearing
the
style
of
their
beards
and
many
details
which
were
hard
to
identify
showed
that
they
belonged
to
the
upper
classes
there
were
no
coat
hooks
for
them
to
use
and
so
they
had
placed
their
hats
under
the
bench
each
probably
having
followed
the
example
of
the
others
when
those
who
were
sitting
nearest
the
door
saw
and
the
usher
of
the
court
they
stood
up
to
greet
them
and
when
the
others
saw
that
they
also
thought
they
had
to
greet
them
so
that
as
the
two
of
them
went
by
all
the
people
there
stood
up
none
of
them
stood
properly
upright
their
backs
were
bowed
their
knees
bent
they
stood
like
beggars
on
the
street
waited
for
the
usher
who
was
following
just
behind
him
they
must
all
be
very
dispirited
he
said
yes
said
the
usher
they
are
the
accused
everyone
you
see
here
has
been
accused
really
said
they
colleagues
of
mine
then
and
he
turned
to
the
nearest
one
a
tall
thin
man
with
hair
that
was
nearly
grey
what
is
it
you
are
waiting
for
here
asked
politely
but
the
man
was
startled
at
being
spoken
to
unexpectedly
which
was
all
the
more
pitiful
to
see
because
the
man
clearly
had
some
experience
of
the
world
and
elsewhere
would
certainly
have
been
able
to
show
his
superiority
and
would
not
have
easily
given
up
the
advantage
he
had
acquired
here
though
he
did
not
know
what
answer
to
give
to
such
a
simple
question
and
looked
round
at
the
others
as
if
they
were
under
some
obligation
to
help
him
and
as
if
could
expect
any
answer
from
him
without
this
help
then
the
usher
of
the
court
stepped
forward
to
him
and
in
order
to
calm
him
down
and
raise
his
spirits
said
the
gentleman
here
only
asking
what
it
is
you
waiting
for
you
can
give
him
an
answer
the
voice
of
the
usher
was
probably
familiar
to
him
and
had
a
better
effect
than
i
i
waiting
he
began
and
then
came
to
a
halt
he
had
clearly
chosen
this
beginning
so
that
he
could
give
a
precise
answer
to
the
question
but
now
he
know
how
to
continue
some
of
the
others
waiting
had
come
closer
and
stood
round
the
group
the
usher
of
the
court
said
to
them
get
out
the
way
keep
the
gangway
free
they
moved
back
slightly
but
not
as
far
as
where
they
had
been
sitting
before
in
the
meantime
the
man
whom
had
first
approached
had
pulled
himself
together
and
even
answered
him
with
a
smile
a
month
ago
i
made
some
applications
for
evidence
to
be
heard
in
my
case
and
i
waiting
for
it
to
be
settled
you
certainly
seem
to
be
going
to
a
lot
of
effort
said
yes
said
the
man
it
is
my
affair
after
all
not
everyone
thinks
the
same
way
as
you
do
said
i
been
indicted
as
well
but
i
swear
on
my
soul
that
i
neither
submitted
evidence
nor
done
anything
else
of
the
sort
do
you
really
think
that
necessary
i
do
really
know
exactly
said
the
man
once
more
totally
unsure
of
himself
he
clearly
thought
was
joking
with
him
and
therefore
probably
thought
it
best
to
repeat
his
earlier
answer
in
order
to
avoid
making
any
new
mistakes
with
looking
at
him
impatiently
he
just
said
as
far
as
i
concerned
i
applied
to
have
this
evidence
heard
perhaps
you
do
believe
i
been
indicted
asked
oh
please
i
certainly
do
said
the
man
stepping
slightly
to
one
side
but
there
was
more
anxiety
in
his
answer
than
belief
you
do
believe
me
then
asked
and
took
hold
of
his
arm
unconsciously
prompted
by
the
man
humble
demeanour
and
as
if
he
wanted
to
force
him
to
believe
him
but
he
did
not
want
to
hurt
the
man
and
had
only
taken
hold
of
him
very
lightly
nonetheless
the
man
cried
out
as
if
had
grasped
him
not
with
two
fingers
but
with
red
hot
tongs
shouting
in
this
ridiculous
way
finally
made
tired
of
him
if
he
did
believe
he
was
indicted
then
so
much
the
better
maybe
he
even
thought
was
a
judge
and
before
leaving
he
held
him
a
lot
harder
shoved
him
back
onto
the
bench
and
walked
on
these
defendants
are
so
sensitive
most
of
them
said
the
usher
of
the
court
almost
all
of
those
who
had
been
waiting
had
now
assembled
around
the
man
who
by
now
had
stopped
shouting
and
they
seemed
to
be
asking
him
lots
of
precise
questions
about
the
incident
was
approached
by
a
security
guard
identifiable
mainly
by
his
sword
of
which
the
scabbard
seemed
to
be
made
of
aluminium
this
greatly
surprised
and
he
reached
out
for
it
with
his
hand
the
guard
had
come
because
of
the
shouting
and
asked
what
had
been
happening
the
usher
of
the
court
said
a
few
words
to
try
and
calm
him
down
but
the
guard
explained
that
he
had
to
look
into
it
himself
saluted
and
hurried
on
walking
with
very
short
steps
probably
because
of
gout
did
concern
himself
long
with
the
guard
or
these
people
especially
as
he
saw
a
turning
off
the
corridor
about
half
way
along
it
on
the
right
hand
side
where
there
was
no
door
to
stop
him
going
that
way
he
asked
the
usher
whether
that
was
the
right
way
to
go
the
usher
nodded
and
that
is
the
way
that
went
the
usher
remained
always
one
or
two
steps
behind
k
which
he
found
irritating
as
in
a
place
like
this
it
could
give
the
impression
that
he
was
being
driven
along
by
someone
who
had
arrested
him
so
he
frequently
waited
for
the
usher
to
catch
up
but
the
usher
always
remained
behind
him
in
order
to
put
an
end
to
his
discomfort
finally
said
now
that
i
seen
what
it
looks
like
here
i
like
to
go
you
have
seen
everything
yet
said
the
usher
ingenuously
i
do
want
to
see
everything
said
who
was
also
feeling
very
tired
i
want
to
go
what
is
the
way
to
the
exit
you
have
got
lost
have
you
asked
the
usher
in
amazement
you
go
down
this
way
to
the
corner
then
right
down
the
corridor
straight
ahead
as
far
as
the
door
come
with
me
said
show
me
the
way
i
miss
it
there
are
so
many
different
ways
here
it
the
only
way
there
is
said
the
usher
who
had
now
started
to
sound
quite
reproachful
i
ca
go
back
with
you
again
i
got
to
hand
in
my
report
and
i
already
lost
a
lot
of
time
because
of
you
as
it
is
come
with
me
repeated
now
somewhat
sharper
as
if
he
had
finally
caught
the
usher
out
in
a
lie
do
shout
like
that
whispered
the
usher
offices
all
round
us
here
if
you
do
want
to
go
back
by
yourself
come
on
a
bit
further
with
me
or
else
wait
here
till
i
sorted
out
my
report
then
i
be
glad
to
go
back
with
you
again
no
no
said
i
will
not
wait
and
you
must
come
with
me
now
had
still
not
looked
round
at
anything
at
all
in
the
room
where
he
found
himself
and
it
was
only
when
one
of
the
many
wooden
doors
all
around
him
opened
that
he
noticed
it
a
young
woman
probably
summoned
by
the
loudness
of
voice
entered
and
asked
what
is
it
the
gentleman
wants
in
the
darkness
behind
her
there
was
also
a
man
approaching
looked
at
the
usher
he
had
after
all
said
that
would
take
any
notice
of
and
now
there
were
two
people
coming
it
only
needed
a
few
and
everyone
in
the
office
would
become
aware
of
him
and
asking
for
explanations
as
to
why
he
was
there
the
only
understandable
and
acceptable
thing
to
say
was
that
he
was
accused
of
something
and
wanted
to
know
the
date
of
his
next
hearing
but
this
was
an
explanation
he
did
not
want
to
give
especially
as
it
was
not
true
he
had
only
come
out
of
curiosity
or
else
an
explanation
even
less
usable
he
could
say
that
he
wanted
to
ascertain
that
the
court
was
as
revolting
on
the
inside
as
it
was
on
the
outside
and
it
did
seem
that
he
had
been
quite
right
in
this
supposition
he
had
no
wish
to
intrude
any
deeper
he
was
disturbed
enough
by
what
he
had
seen
already
he
was
not
in
the
right
frame
of
mind
just
then
to
face
a
high
official
such
as
might
appear
from
behind
any
door
and
he
wanted
to
go
either
with
the
usher
of
the
court
or
if
needs
be
alone
but
he
must
have
seemed
very
odd
standing
there
in
silence
and
the
young
woman
and
the
usher
were
indeed
looking
at
him
as
if
they
thought
he
would
go
through
some
major
metamorphosis
any
second
which
they
did
want
to
miss
seeing
and
in
the
doorway
stood
the
man
whom
had
noticed
in
the
background
earlier
he
held
firmly
on
to
the
beam
above
the
low
door
swinging
a
little
on
the
tips
of
his
feet
as
if
becoming
impatient
as
he
watched
but
the
young
woman
was
the
first
to
recognise
that
behaviour
was
caused
by
his
feeling
slightly
unwell
she
brought
a
chair
and
asked
would
you
not
like
to
sit
down
sat
down
immediately
and
in
order
to
keep
his
place
better
put
his
elbows
on
the
armrests
you
a
little
bit
dizzy
are
you
she
asked
him
her
face
was
now
close
in
front
of
him
it
bore
the
severe
expression
that
many
young
women
have
just
when
they
in
the
bloom
of
their
youth
it
nothing
for
you
to
worry
about
she
said
that
nothing
unusual
here
almost
everyone
gets
an
attack
like
that
the
first
time
they
come
here
this
is
your
first
time
is
it
yes
it
nothing
unusual
then
the
sun
burns
down
on
the
roof
and
the
hot
wood
makes
the
air
so
thick
and
heavy
it
makes
this
place
rather
unsuitable
for
offices
whatever
other
advantages
it
might
offer
but
the
air
is
almost
impossible
to
breathe
on
days
when
there
a
lot
of
business
and
that
almost
every
day
and
when
you
think
that
there
a
lot
of
washing
put
out
to
dry
here
as
well
and
we
ca
stop
the
tenants
doing
that
it
not
surprising
you
started
to
feel
unwell
but
you
get
used
to
the
air
alright
in
the
end
when
you
here
for
the
second
or
third
time
you
hardly
notice
how
oppressive
the
air
is
are
you
feeling
any
better
now
made
no
answer
he
felt
too
embarrassed
at
being
put
at
the
mercy
of
these
people
by
his
sudden
weakness
and
learning
the
reason
for
feeling
ill
made
him
feel
not
better
but
a
little
worse
the
girl
noticed
it
straight
away
and
to
make
the
air
fresher
for
she
took
a
window
pole
that
was
leaning
against
the
wall
and
pushed
open
a
small
hatch
directly
above
head
that
led
to
the
outside
but
so
much
soot
fell
in
that
the
girl
had
to
immediately
close
the
hatch
again
and
clean
the
soot
off
hands
with
her
handkerchief
as
was
too
tired
to
do
that
for
himself
he
would
have
liked
just
to
sit
quietly
where
he
was
until
he
had
enough
strength
to
leave
and
the
less
fuss
people
made
about
him
the
sooner
that
would
be
but
then
the
girl
said
you
stay
here
we
in
people
way
here
looked
at
her
as
if
to
ask
whose
way
they
were
impeding
if
you
like
i
can
take
you
to
the
sick
room
and
turning
to
the
man
in
the
doorway
said
please
help
me
the
man
immediately
came
over
to
them
but
did
not
want
to
go
to
the
sick
room
that
was
just
what
he
wanted
to
avoid
being
led
further
from
place
to
place
the
further
he
went
the
more
difficult
it
must
become
so
he
said
i
am
able
to
walk
now
and
stood
up
shaking
after
becoming
used
to
sitting
so
comfortably
but
then
he
was
unable
to
stay
upright
i
ca
manage
it
he
said
shaking
his
head
and
sat
down
again
with
a
sigh
he
remembered
the
usher
who
despite
everything
would
have
been
able
to
lead
him
out
of
there
but
who
seemed
to
have
gone
long
before
looked
out
between
the
man
and
the
young
woman
who
were
standing
in
front
of
him
but
was
unable
to
find
the
usher
i
think
said
the
man
who
was
elegantly
dressed
and
whose
appearance
was
made
especially
impressive
with
a
grey
waistcoat
that
had
two
long
sharply
tailored
points
the
gentleman
is
feeling
unwell
because
of
the
atmosphere
here
so
the
best
thing
and
what
he
would
most
prefer
would
be
not
to
take
him
to
the
sick
room
but
get
him
out
of
the
offices
altogether
that
right
exclaimed
with
such
joy
that
he
nearly
interrupted
what
the
man
was
saying
i
sure
make
me
feel
better
straight
away
i
really
not
that
weak
all
i
need
is
a
little
support
under
my
arms
i
wo
cause
you
much
trouble
not
such
a
long
way
anyway
lead
me
to
the
door
and
then
i
sit
on
the
stairs
for
a
while
and
soon
recover
as
i
do
suffer
from
attacks
like
this
at
all
i
surprised
at
it
myself
i
also
work
in
an
office
and
i
quite
used
to
office
air
but
here
it
seems
to
be
too
strong
said
so
yourselves
so
please
be
so
kind
as
to
help
me
on
my
way
a
little
i
feeling
dizzy
you
see
and
it
make
me
ill
if
i
stand
up
by
myself
and
with
that
he
raised
his
shoulders
to
make
it
easier
for
the
two
of
them
to
take
him
by
the
arms
the
man
however
did
follow
this
suggestion
but
just
stood
there
with
his
hands
in
his
trouser
pockets
and
laughed
out
loud
there
you
see
he
said
to
the
girl
i
was
quite
right
the
gentleman
is
only
unwell
here
and
not
in
general
the
young
woman
smiled
too
but
lightly
tapped
the
man
arm
with
the
tips
of
her
fingers
as
if
he
had
allowed
himself
too
much
fun
with
so
what
do
you
think
then
said
the
man
still
laughing
i
really
do
want
to
lead
the
gentleman
out
of
here
that
alright
then
said
the
girl
briefly
inclining
her
charming
head
do
worry
too
much
about
him
laughing
said
the
girl
to
who
had
become
unhappy
once
more
and
stared
quietly
in
front
of
himself
as
if
needing
no
further
explanation
this
gentleman
may
i
introduce
you
the
man
gave
his
permission
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
so
this
gentleman
job
is
to
give
out
information
he
gives
all
the
information
they
need
to
people
who
are
waiting
as
our
court
and
its
offices
are
not
very
well
known
among
the
public
he
gets
asked
for
quite
a
lot
he
has
an
answer
for
every
question
you
can
try
him
out
if
you
feel
like
it
but
that
not
his
only
distinction
his
other
distinction
is
his
elegance
of
dress
we
that
to
say
all
of
us
who
work
in
the
offices
here
we
decided
that
the
would
have
to
be
elegantly
dressed
as
he
continually
has
to
deal
with
the
litigants
and
he
the
first
one
they
meet
so
he
needs
to
give
a
dignified
first
impression
the
rest
of
us
i
afraid
as
you
can
see
just
by
looking
at
me
dress
very
badly
and
and
there
not
much
point
in
spending
much
on
clothes
anyway
as
we
hardly
ever
leave
the
offices
we
even
sleep
here
but
as
i
said
we
decided
that
the
would
have
to
have
nice
clothes
as
the
management
here
is
rather
peculiar
in
this
respect
and
they
would
get
them
for
us
we
had
a
collection
some
of
the
litigants
contributed
too
and
bought
him
these
lovely
clothes
and
some
others
besides
so
everything
would
be
ready
for
him
to
give
a
good
impression
except
that
he
spoils
it
again
by
laughing
and
frightening
people
that
how
it
is
said
the
man
mocking
her
but
i
understand
why
it
is
that
you
explaining
all
our
intimate
facts
to
the
gentleman
or
rather
why
it
is
that
you
pressing
them
on
him
as
i
sure
he
not
all
interested
just
look
at
him
sitting
there
clear
he
occupied
with
his
own
affairs
just
did
not
feel
like
contradicting
the
girl
intention
may
have
been
good
perhaps
she
was
under
instructions
to
distract
him
or
to
give
him
the
chance
to
collect
himself
but
the
attempt
had
not
worked
i
had
to
explain
to
him
why
you
were
laughing
said
the
girl
i
suppose
it
was
insulting
i
think
he
would
forgive
even
worse
insults
if
i
finally
took
him
outside
said
nothing
did
not
even
look
up
he
tolerated
the
two
of
them
negotiating
over
him
like
an
object
that
was
even
what
suited
him
best
but
suddenly
he
felt
the
hand
on
one
arm
and
the
young
woman
hand
on
the
other
up
you
get
then
weakling
said
the
thank
you
both
very
much
said
pleasantly
surprised
as
he
slowly
rose
and
personally
guided
these
unfamiliar
hands
to
the
places
where
he
most
needed
support
as
they
approached
the
corridor
the
girl
said
quietly
into
ear
i
must
seem
to
think
it
very
important
to
show
the
in
a
good
light
but
you
should
doubt
what
i
say
i
just
want
to
say
the
truth
he
is
it
not
really
his
job
to
help
litigants
outside
if
they
unwell
but
he
doing
it
anyway
as
you
can
see
i
do
suppose
any
of
us
is
perhaps
we
all
like
to
be
helpful
but
working
for
the
court
offices
it
easy
for
us
to
give
the
impression
we
are
and
do
want
to
help
anyone
it
makes
me
quite
sad
would
you
not
like
to
sit
down
here
a
while
asked
the
there
were
already
in
the
corridor
and
just
in
front
of
the
defendant
whom
had
spoken
to
earlier
felt
almost
ashamed
to
be
seen
by
him
earlier
he
had
stood
so
upright
in
front
of
him
and
now
he
had
to
be
supported
by
two
others
his
hat
was
held
up
by
the
balanced
on
outstretched
fingers
his
hair
was
dishevelled
and
hung
down
onto
the
sweat
on
his
forehead
but
the
defendant
seemed
to
notice
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
and
just
stood
there
humbly
as
if
wanting
to
apologise
to
the
for
being
there
the
looked
past
him
i
know
he
said
that
my
case
ca
be
settled
today
not
yet
but
i
come
in
anyway
i
thought
i
thought
i
could
wait
here
anyway
it
sunday
today
got
plenty
of
time
and
i
not
disturbing
anyone
here
there
no
need
to
be
so
apologetic
said
the
it
very
commendable
for
you
to
be
so
attentive
you
are
taking
up
space
here
when
you
do
need
to
but
as
long
as
you
do
get
in
my
way
i
will
do
nothing
to
stop
you
following
the
progress
of
your
case
as
closely
as
you
like
when
one
has
seen
so
many
people
who
shamefully
neglect
their
cases
one
learns
to
show
patience
with
people
like
you
do
sit
down
he
very
good
with
the
litigants
whispered
the
girl
nodded
but
started
to
move
off
again
when
the
repeated
would
you
not
like
to
sit
down
here
a
while
no
said
i
do
want
to
rest
he
had
said
that
as
decisively
as
he
could
but
in
fact
it
would
have
done
him
a
lot
of
good
to
sit
down
it
was
as
if
he
were
suffering
he
felt
as
if
he
were
on
a
ship
in
a
rough
sea
as
if
the
water
were
hitting
against
the
wooden
walls
a
thundering
from
the
depths
of
the
corridor
as
if
the
torrent
were
crashing
over
it
as
if
the
corridor
were
swaying
and
the
waiting
litigants
on
each
side
of
it
rising
and
sinking
it
made
the
calmness
of
the
girl
and
the
man
leading
him
all
the
more
incomprehensible
he
was
at
their
mercy
if
they
let
go
of
him
he
would
fall
like
a
board
their
little
eyes
glanced
here
and
there
could
feel
the
evenness
of
their
steps
but
could
not
do
the
same
as
from
step
to
step
he
was
virtually
being
carried
he
finally
noticed
they
were
speaking
to
him
but
he
did
not
understand
them
all
he
heard
was
a
noise
that
filled
all
the
space
and
through
which
there
seemed
to
be
an
unchanging
higher
note
sounding
like
a
siren
louder
he
whispered
with
his
head
sunk
low
ashamed
at
having
to
ask
them
to
speak
louder
when
he
knew
they
had
spoken
loudly
enough
even
if
it
had
been
for
him
incomprehensible
at
last
a
draught
of
cool
air
blew
in
his
face
as
if
a
gap
had
been
torn
out
in
the
wall
in
front
of
him
and
next
to
him
he
heard
someone
say
first
he
says
he
wants
to
go
and
then
you
can
tell
him
a
hundred
times
that
this
is
the
way
out
and
he
does
move
became
aware
that
he
was
standing
in
front
of
the
way
out
and
that
the
young
woman
had
opened
the
door
it
seemed
to
him
that
all
his
strength
returned
to
him
at
once
and
to
get
a
foretaste
of
freedom
he
stepped
straight
on
to
one
of
the
stairs
and
took
his
leave
there
of
his
companions
who
bowed
to
him
thank
you
very
much
he
repeated
shook
their
hands
once
more
and
did
not
let
go
until
he
thought
he
saw
that
they
found
it
hard
to
bear
the
comparatively
fresh
air
from
the
stairway
after
being
so
long
used
to
the
air
in
the
offices
they
were
hardly
able
to
reply
and
the
young
woman
might
even
have
fallen
over
if
had
not
shut
the
door
extremely
fast
then
stood
still
for
a
while
combed
his
hair
with
the
help
of
a
pocket
mirror
picked
up
his
hat
from
the
next
stair
the
must
have
thrown
it
down
there
and
then
he
ran
down
the
steps
so
fresh
and
in
such
long
leaps
that
the
contrast
with
his
previous
state
nearly
frightened
him
his
normally
sturdy
state
of
health
had
never
prepared
him
for
surprises
such
as
this
did
his
body
want
to
revolt
and
cause
him
a
new
trial
as
he
was
bearing
the
old
one
with
such
little
effort
he
did
not
quite
reject
the
idea
that
he
should
see
a
doctor
the
next
time
he
had
the
chance
but
whatever
he
did
and
this
was
something
on
which
he
could
advise
himself
he
wanted
to
spend
all
sunday
mornings
in
future
better
than
he
had
spent
this
one
chapter
four
miss
b√ºrstner
friend
for
some
time
after
this
found
it
impossible
to
exchange
even
just
a
few
words
with
miss
b√ºrstner
he
tried
to
reach
her
in
many
and
various
ways
but
she
always
found
a
way
to
avoid
it
he
would
come
straight
home
from
the
office
remain
in
her
room
without
the
light
on
and
sit
on
the
sofa
with
nothing
more
to
distract
him
than
keeping
watch
on
the
empty
hallway
if
the
maid
went
by
and
closed
the
door
of
the
apparently
empty
room
he
would
get
up
after
a
while
and
open
it
again
he
got
up
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
in
the
morning
so
that
he
might
perhaps
find
miss
b√ºrstner
alone
as
she
went
to
the
office
but
none
of
these
efforts
brought
any
success
then
he
wrote
her
a
letter
both
to
the
office
and
the
flat
attempting
once
more
to
justify
his
behaviour
offered
to
make
whatever
amends
he
could
promised
never
to
cross
whatever
boundary
she
might
set
him
and
begged
merely
to
have
the
chance
to
speak
to
her
some
time
especially
as
he
was
unable
to
do
anything
with
grubach
either
until
he
had
spoken
with
miss
b√ºrstner
he
finally
informed
her
that
the
following
sunday
he
would
stay
in
his
room
all
day
waiting
for
a
sign
from
her
that
there
was
some
hope
of
his
request
being
fulfilled
or
at
least
that
she
would
explain
to
him
why
she
could
not
fulfil
it
even
though
he
had
promised
to
observe
whatever
stipulations
she
might
make
the
letters
were
not
returned
but
there
was
no
answer
either
however
on
the
following
sunday
there
was
a
sign
that
seemed
clear
enough
it
was
still
early
when
noticed
through
the
keyhole
that
there
was
an
unusual
level
of
activity
in
the
hallway
which
soon
abated
a
french
teacher
although
she
was
german
and
called
montag
a
pale
and
febrile
girl
with
a
slight
limp
who
had
previously
occupied
a
room
of
her
own
was
moving
into
miss
b√ºrstner
room
she
could
be
seen
shuffling
through
the
hallway
for
several
hours
there
was
always
another
piece
of
clothing
or
a
blanket
or
a
book
that
she
had
forgotten
and
had
to
be
fetched
specially
and
brought
into
the
new
home
when
grubach
brought
his
breakfast
ever
since
the
time
when
she
had
made
so
cross
she
did
trust
the
maid
to
do
the
slightest
job
he
had
no
choice
but
to
speak
to
her
for
the
first
time
in
five
days
why
is
there
so
much
noise
in
the
hallway
today
he
asked
as
she
poured
his
coffee
out
ca
something
be
done
about
it
does
this
clearing
out
have
to
be
done
on
a
sunday
did
not
look
up
at
grubach
but
he
saw
nonetheless
that
she
seemed
to
feel
some
relief
as
she
breathed
in
even
sharp
questions
like
this
from
she
perceived
as
forgiveness
or
as
the
beginning
of
forgiveness
we
not
clearing
anything
out
she
said
it
just
that
miss
montag
is
moving
in
with
miss
b√ºrstner
and
is
moving
her
things
across
she
said
nothing
more
but
just
waited
to
see
how
would
take
it
and
whether
he
would
allow
her
to
carry
on
speaking
but
kept
her
in
uncertainty
took
the
spoon
and
pensively
stirred
his
coffee
while
he
remained
silent
then
he
looked
up
at
her
and
said
what
about
the
suspicions
you
had
earlier
about
miss
b√ºrstner
have
you
given
them
up
called
grubach
who
had
been
waiting
for
this
very
question
as
she
put
her
hands
together
and
held
them
out
towards
him
i
just
made
a
chance
remark
and
you
took
it
so
badly
i
have
the
slightest
intention
of
offending
anyone
not
you
or
anyone
else
you
known
me
for
long
enough
i
sure
convinced
of
that
you
do
know
how
i
been
suffering
for
the
past
few
days
that
i
should
tell
lies
about
my
tenants
and
you
you
believed
it
and
said
i
should
give
you
notice
give
you
notice
at
this
last
outcry
grubach
was
already
choking
back
her
tears
she
raised
her
apron
to
her
face
and
blubbered
out
loud
oh
do
cry
grubach
said
looking
out
the
window
he
was
thinking
only
of
miss
b√ºrstner
and
how
she
was
accepting
an
unknown
girl
into
her
room
now
do
cry
he
said
again
as
he
turned
his
look
back
into
the
room
where
grubach
was
still
crying
i
meant
no
harm
either
when
i
said
that
it
was
simply
a
misunderstanding
between
us
that
can
happen
even
between
old
friends
sometimes
grubach
pulled
her
apron
down
to
below
her
eyes
to
see
whether
really
was
attempting
a
reconciliation
well
yes
that
how
it
is
said
and
as
grubach
behaviour
indicated
that
the
captain
had
said
nothing
he
dared
to
add
do
you
really
think
then
that
i
want
to
make
an
enemy
of
you
for
the
sake
of
a
girl
we
hardly
know
yes
you
quite
right
said
grubach
and
then
to
her
misfortune
as
soon
as
she
felt
just
a
little
freer
to
speak
she
added
something
rather
inept
i
kept
asking
myself
why
it
was
that
took
such
an
interest
in
miss
b√ºrstner
why
does
he
quarrel
with
me
over
her
when
he
knows
that
any
cross
word
from
him
and
i
ca
sleep
that
night
and
i
did
say
anything
about
miss
b√ºrstner
that
i
seen
with
my
own
eyes
said
nothing
in
reply
he
should
have
chased
her
from
the
room
as
soon
as
she
had
opened
her
mouth
and
he
want
to
do
that
he
contented
himself
with
merely
drinking
his
coffee
and
letting
grubach
feel
that
she
was
superfluous
outside
the
dragging
steps
of
miss
montag
could
still
be
heard
as
she
went
from
one
side
of
the
hallway
to
the
other
do
you
hear
that
asked
pointing
his
hand
at
the
door
yes
said
grubach
with
a
sigh
i
wanted
to
give
her
some
help
and
i
wanted
the
maid
to
help
her
too
but
stubborn
she
wants
to
move
everything
in
herself
i
wonder
at
miss
b√ºrstner
i
often
feel
it
a
burden
for
me
to
have
miss
montag
as
a
tenant
but
miss
b√ºrstner
accepts
her
into
her
room
with
herself
there
nothing
there
for
you
to
worry
about
said
crushing
the
remains
of
a
sugar
lump
in
his
cup
does
she
cause
you
any
trouble
no
said
grubach
in
itself
it
very
good
to
have
her
there
it
makes
another
room
free
for
me
and
i
can
let
my
nephew
the
captain
occupy
it
i
began
to
worry
he
might
be
disturbing
you
when
i
had
to
let
him
live
in
the
living
room
next
to
you
over
the
last
few
days
he
not
very
considerate
what
an
idea
said
standing
up
there
no
question
of
that
you
seem
to
think
that
because
i
stand
this
and
of
miss
montag
that
i
and
there
she
goes
back
again
grubach
appeared
quite
powerless
should
i
tell
her
to
leave
moving
the
rest
of
her
things
over
till
later
then
if
that
what
you
want
i
do
it
immediately
but
she
has
to
move
in
with
miss
b√ºrstner
said
yes
said
grubach
without
quite
understanding
what
meant
so
she
has
to
take
her
things
over
there
grubach
just
nodded
was
irritated
all
the
more
by
this
dumb
helplessness
which
seen
from
the
outside
could
have
seemed
like
a
kind
of
defiance
on
her
part
he
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
between
the
window
and
the
door
thus
depriving
grubach
of
the
chance
to
leave
which
she
otherwise
probably
would
have
done
just
as
once
more
reached
the
door
someone
knocked
at
it
it
was
the
maid
to
say
that
miss
montag
would
like
to
have
a
few
words
with
and
therefore
requested
that
he
come
to
the
dining
room
where
she
was
waiting
for
him
heard
the
maid
out
thoughtfully
and
then
looked
back
at
the
shocked
grubach
in
a
way
that
was
almost
contemptuous
his
look
seemed
to
be
saying
that
had
been
expecting
this
invitation
for
miss
montag
for
a
long
time
and
that
it
was
confirmation
of
the
suffering
he
had
been
made
to
endure
that
sunday
morning
from
grubach
tenants
he
sent
the
maid
back
with
the
reply
that
he
was
on
his
way
then
he
went
to
the
wardrobe
to
change
his
coat
and
in
answer
to
grubach
gentle
whining
about
the
nuisance
miss
montag
was
causing
merely
asked
her
to
clear
away
the
breakfast
things
but
you
hardly
touched
it
said
grubach
oh
just
take
it
away
shouted
it
seemed
to
him
that
miss
montag
was
mixed
up
in
everything
and
made
it
repulsive
to
him
as
he
went
through
the
hallway
he
looked
at
the
closed
door
of
miss
b√ºrstner
room
but
it
was
there
that
he
was
invited
but
the
dining
room
to
which
he
yanked
the
door
open
without
knocking
the
room
was
long
but
narrow
with
one
window
there
was
only
enough
space
available
to
put
two
cupboards
at
an
angle
in
the
corner
by
the
door
and
the
rest
of
the
room
was
entirely
taken
up
with
the
long
dining
table
which
started
by
the
door
and
reached
all
the
way
to
the
great
window
which
was
thus
made
almost
inaccessible
the
table
was
already
laid
for
a
large
number
of
people
as
on
sundays
almost
all
the
tenants
ate
their
dinner
here
at
midday
when
entered
miss
montag
came
towards
him
from
the
window
along
one
side
of
the
table
they
greeted
each
other
in
silence
then
miss
montag
her
head
unusually
erect
as
always
said
i
not
sure
whether
you
know
me
looked
at
her
with
a
frown
of
course
i
do
he
said
you
been
living
here
with
grubach
for
quite
some
time
now
but
i
get
the
impression
you
do
pay
much
attention
to
going
on
in
the
lodging
house
said
miss
montag
no
said
would
you
not
like
to
sit
down
said
miss
montag
in
silence
the
two
of
them
drew
chairs
out
from
the
farthest
end
of
the
table
and
sat
down
facing
each
other
but
miss
montag
stood
straight
up
again
as
she
had
left
her
handbag
on
the
window
sill
and
went
to
fetch
it
she
shuffled
down
the
whole
length
of
the
room
when
she
came
back
the
handbag
lightly
swinging
she
said
i
like
just
to
have
a
few
words
with
you
on
behalf
of
my
friend
she
would
have
come
herself
but
she
feeling
a
little
unwell
today
perhaps
you
be
kind
enough
to
forgive
her
and
listen
to
me
instead
there
anyway
nothing
that
she
could
have
said
that
i
wo
on
the
contrary
in
fact
i
think
i
can
say
even
more
than
her
because
i
relatively
impartial
would
you
not
agree
what
is
there
to
say
then
answered
who
was
tired
of
miss
montag
continuously
watching
his
lips
in
that
way
she
took
control
of
what
he
wanted
to
say
before
he
said
it
miss
b√ºrstner
clearly
refuses
to
grant
me
the
personal
meeting
that
i
asked
her
for
that
how
it
is
said
miss
montag
or
rather
that
not
at
all
how
it
is
the
way
you
put
it
is
remarkably
severe
generally
speaking
meetings
are
neither
granted
nor
the
opposite
but
it
can
be
that
meetings
are
considered
unnecessary
and
that
how
it
is
here
now
after
your
comment
i
can
speak
openly
you
asked
my
friend
verbally
or
in
writing
for
the
chance
to
speak
with
her
now
my
friend
is
aware
of
your
reasons
for
asking
for
this
meeting
or
at
least
i
suppose
she
is
and
so
for
reasons
i
know
nothing
about
she
is
quite
sure
that
it
would
be
of
no
benefit
to
anyone
if
this
meeting
actually
took
place
moreover
it
was
only
yesterday
and
only
very
briefly
that
she
made
it
clear
to
me
that
such
a
meeting
could
be
of
no
benefit
for
yourself
either
she
feels
that
it
can
only
have
been
a
matter
of
chance
that
such
an
idea
came
to
you
and
that
even
without
any
explanations
from
her
you
will
very
soon
come
to
realise
yourself
if
you
have
not
done
so
already
the
futility
of
your
idea
my
answer
to
that
is
that
although
it
may
be
quite
right
i
consider
it
advantageous
if
the
matter
is
to
be
made
perfectly
clear
to
give
you
an
explicit
answer
i
offered
my
services
in
taking
on
the
task
and
after
some
hesitation
my
friend
conceded
i
hope
however
also
to
have
acted
in
your
interests
as
even
the
slightest
uncertainty
in
the
least
significant
of
matters
will
always
remain
a
cause
of
suffering
and
if
as
in
this
case
it
can
be
removed
without
substantial
effort
then
it
is
better
if
that
is
done
without
delay
i
thank
you
said
as
soon
as
miss
montag
had
finished
he
stood
slowly
up
looked
at
her
then
across
the
table
then
out
the
window
the
house
opposite
stood
there
in
the
sun
and
went
to
the
door
miss
montag
followed
him
a
few
paces
as
if
she
did
not
quite
trust
him
at
the
door
however
both
of
them
had
to
step
back
as
it
opened
and
captain
lanz
entered
this
was
the
first
time
that
had
seen
him
close
up
he
was
a
large
man
of
about
forty
with
a
tanned
fleshy
face
he
bowed
slightly
intending
it
also
for
and
then
went
over
to
miss
montag
and
deferentially
kissed
her
hand
he
was
very
elegant
in
the
way
he
moved
the
courtesy
he
showed
towards
miss
montag
made
a
striking
contrast
with
the
way
she
had
been
treated
by
nonetheless
miss
montag
did
not
seem
to
be
cross
with
as
it
even
seemed
to
him
that
she
wanted
to
introduce
the
captain
however
did
not
want
to
be
introduced
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
show
any
sort
of
friendliness
either
to
miss
montag
or
to
the
captain
the
kiss
on
the
hand
had
for
bound
them
into
a
group
which
would
keep
him
at
a
distance
from
miss
b√ºrstner
whilst
at
the
same
time
seeming
to
be
totally
harmless
and
unselfish
thought
however
that
he
saw
more
than
that
he
thought
he
also
saw
that
miss
montag
had
chosen
a
means
of
doing
it
that
was
good
but
she
exaggerated
the
importance
of
the
relationship
between
and
miss
b√ºrstner
and
above
all
she
exaggerated
the
importance
of
asking
to
speak
with
her
and
she
tried
at
the
same
time
to
make
out
that
was
exaggerating
everything
she
would
be
disappointed
did
not
want
to
exaggerate
anything
he
was
aware
that
miss
b√ºrstner
was
a
little
typist
who
would
not
offer
him
much
resistance
for
long
in
doing
so
he
deliberately
took
no
account
of
what
grubach
had
told
him
about
miss
b√ºrstner
all
these
things
were
going
through
his
mind
as
he
left
the
room
with
hardly
a
polite
word
he
wanted
to
go
straight
to
his
room
but
a
little
laugh
from
miss
montag
that
he
heard
from
the
dining
room
behind
him
brought
him
to
the
idea
that
he
might
prepare
a
surprise
for
the
two
of
them
the
captain
and
miss
montag
he
looked
round
and
listened
to
find
out
if
there
might
be
any
disturbance
from
any
of
the
surrounding
rooms
everywhere
was
quiet
the
only
thing
to
be
heard
was
the
conversation
from
the
dining
room
and
grubach
voice
from
the
passage
leading
to
the
kitchen
this
seemed
an
opportune
time
went
to
miss
b√ºrstner
room
and
knocked
gently
there
was
no
sound
so
he
knocked
again
but
there
was
still
no
answer
in
reply
was
she
asleep
or
was
she
really
unwell
or
was
she
just
pretending
as
she
realised
it
could
only
be
knocking
so
gently
assumed
she
was
pretending
and
knocked
harder
eventually
when
the
knocking
brought
no
result
he
carefully
opened
the
door
with
the
sense
of
doing
something
that
was
not
only
improper
but
also
pointless
in
the
room
there
was
more
it
looked
hardly
at
all
like
the
room
had
known
before
against
the
wall
there
were
now
two
beds
behind
one
another
there
were
clothes
piled
up
on
three
chairs
near
the
door
a
wardrobe
stood
open
miss
b√ºrstner
must
have
gone
out
while
miss
montag
was
speaking
to
him
in
the
dining
room
was
not
greatly
bothered
by
this
he
had
hardly
expected
to
be
able
to
find
miss
b√ºrstner
so
easily
and
had
made
this
attempt
for
little
more
reason
than
to
spite
miss
montag
but
that
made
it
all
the
more
embarrassing
for
him
when
as
he
was
closing
the
door
again
he
saw
miss
montag
and
the
captain
talking
in
the
open
doorway
of
the
dining
room
they
had
probably
been
standing
there
ever
since
had
opened
the
door
they
avoided
seeming
to
observe
but
chatted
lightly
and
followed
his
movements
with
glances
the
absent
minded
glances
to
the
side
such
as
you
make
during
a
conversation
but
these
glances
were
heavy
for
and
he
rushed
alongside
the
wall
back
into
his
own
room
chapter
five
the
one
evening
a
few
days
later
was
walking
along
one
of
the
corridors
that
separated
his
office
from
the
main
stairway
he
was
nearly
the
last
one
to
leave
for
home
that
evening
there
remained
only
a
couple
of
workers
in
the
light
of
a
single
bulb
in
the
dispatch
department
when
he
heard
a
sigh
from
behind
a
door
which
he
had
himself
never
opened
but
which
he
had
always
thought
just
led
into
a
junk
room
he
stood
in
amazement
and
listened
again
to
establish
whether
he
might
not
be
mistaken
for
a
while
there
was
silence
but
then
came
some
more
sighs
his
first
thought
was
to
fetch
one
of
the
servitors
it
might
well
have
been
worth
having
a
witness
present
but
then
he
was
taken
by
an
uncontrollable
curiosity
that
make
him
simply
yank
the
door
open
it
was
as
he
had
thought
a
junk
room
old
unusable
forms
empty
stone
lay
scattered
behind
the
entrance
but
in
the
room
itself
stood
three
men
crouching
under
the
low
ceiling
a
candle
fixed
on
a
shelf
gave
them
light
what
are
you
doing
here
asked
quietly
but
crossly
and
without
thinking
one
of
the
men
was
clearly
in
charge
and
attracted
attention
by
being
dressed
in
a
kind
of
dark
leather
costume
which
left
his
neck
and
chest
and
his
arms
exposed
he
did
not
answer
but
the
other
two
called
out
we
to
be
beaten
because
you
made
a
complaint
about
us
to
the
examining
judge
and
now
finally
realised
that
it
was
actually
the
two
policemen
franz
and
willem
and
that
the
third
man
held
a
cane
in
his
hand
with
which
to
beat
them
well
said
staring
at
them
i
did
make
any
complaint
i
only
said
what
took
place
in
my
home
and
your
behaviour
was
not
entirely
unobjectionable
after
all
said
willem
while
franz
clearly
tried
to
shelter
behind
him
as
protection
from
the
third
man
if
you
knew
how
badly
we
get
paid
you
would
think
so
badly
of
us
i
got
a
family
to
feed
and
franz
here
wanted
to
get
married
you
just
have
to
get
more
money
where
you
can
you
ca
do
it
just
by
working
hard
not
however
hard
you
try
i
was
sorely
tempted
by
your
fine
clothes
policemen
are
allowed
to
do
that
sort
of
thing
course
they
are
and
it
was
right
of
us
but
it
tradition
that
the
clothes
go
to
the
officers
that
how
it
always
been
believe
me
and
understandable
too
is
it
what
can
things
like
that
mean
for
anyone
unlucky
enough
to
be
arrested
but
if
he
starts
talking
about
it
openly
then
the
punishment
has
to
follow
i
did
know
about
any
of
this
that
you
been
telling
me
and
i
made
no
sort
of
request
that
you
be
punished
i
was
simply
acting
on
principle
franz
said
willem
turning
to
the
other
policeman
did
i
tell
you
that
the
gentleman
did
say
he
wanted
us
to
be
punished
now
you
can
hear
for
yourself
he
did
even
know
we
have
to
be
punished
do
you
let
them
persuade
you
talking
like
that
said
the
third
man
to
this
punishment
is
both
just
and
unavoidable
do
listen
to
him
said
willem
interrupting
himself
only
to
quickly
bring
his
hand
to
his
mouth
when
it
had
received
a
stroke
of
the
cane
we
only
being
punished
because
you
made
a
complaint
against
us
nothing
would
have
happened
to
us
otherwise
not
even
if
they
found
out
what
we
done
can
you
call
that
justice
both
of
us
me
especially
we
proved
our
worth
as
good
police
officers
over
a
long
period
you
got
to
admit
yourself
that
as
far
as
official
work
was
concerned
we
did
the
job
well
things
looked
good
for
us
we
had
prospects
it
quite
certain
that
we
would
been
made
too
like
this
one
only
he
had
the
luck
not
to
have
anyone
make
a
complaint
about
him
as
you
really
do
get
many
complaints
like
that
only
that
all
finished
now
our
careers
are
at
an
end
we
going
to
have
to
do
work
now
that
far
inferior
to
police
work
and
besides
all
this
we
going
to
get
this
terrible
painful
beating
can
the
cane
really
cause
so
much
pain
then
asked
testing
the
cane
that
the
swang
in
front
of
him
going
to
have
to
strip
off
totally
naked
said
willem
oh
i
see
said
looking
straight
at
the
his
skin
was
burned
brown
like
a
sailor
and
his
face
showed
health
and
vigour
is
there
then
no
possibility
of
sparing
these
two
their
beating
he
asked
him
no
said
the
shaking
his
head
with
a
laugh
get
undressed
he
ordered
the
policemen
and
to
he
said
you
believe
everything
they
tell
you
it
the
fear
of
being
beaten
already
made
them
a
bit
weak
in
the
head
this
one
here
for
instance
he
pointed
at
willem
all
that
he
told
you
about
his
career
prospects
it
just
ridiculous
look
at
him
look
how
fat
he
is
the
first
strokes
of
the
cane
will
just
get
lost
in
all
that
fat
do
you
know
what
it
is
that
made
him
so
fat
he
in
the
habit
of
everyone
that
gets
arrested
by
him
he
eats
their
breakfast
did
he
eat
up
your
breakfast
yeah
i
thought
as
much
but
a
man
with
a
belly
like
that
ca
be
made
into
a
and
never
will
be
that
is
quite
out
of
the
question
there
are
like
that
willem
insisted
who
had
just
released
the
belt
of
this
trousers
no
said
the
striking
him
such
a
blow
with
the
cane
on
his
neck
that
it
made
him
wince
you
should
be
listening
to
this
just
get
undressed
i
would
make
it
well
worth
your
while
if
you
would
let
them
go
said
and
without
looking
at
the
again
as
such
matters
are
best
carried
on
with
both
pairs
of
eyes
turned
down
he
pulled
out
his
wallet
and
then
you
try
and
put
in
a
complaint
against
me
too
said
the
and
get
me
flogged
no
no
now
do
be
reasonable
said
if
i
had
wanted
to
get
these
two
punished
i
would
not
now
be
trying
to
buy
their
freedom
would
i
could
simply
close
the
door
here
behind
me
go
home
and
see
or
hear
nothing
more
of
it
but
that
not
what
i
doing
it
really
is
of
much
more
importance
to
me
to
let
them
go
free
if
i
had
realised
they
would
be
punished
or
even
that
they
might
be
punished
i
would
never
have
named
them
in
the
first
place
as
they
are
not
the
ones
i
hold
responsible
it
the
organisation
that
to
blame
the
high
officials
are
the
ones
to
blame
that
how
it
is
shouted
the
policemen
who
then
immediately
received
another
blow
on
their
backs
which
were
by
now
exposed
if
you
had
a
senior
judge
here
beneath
your
stick
said
pressing
down
the
cane
as
he
spoke
to
stop
it
being
raised
once
more
i
really
would
do
nothing
to
stop
you
on
the
contrary
i
would
even
pay
you
money
to
give
you
all
the
more
strength
yeah
that
all
very
plausible
what
you
saying
there
said
the
only
i
not
the
sort
of
person
you
can
bribe
it
my
job
to
flog
people
so
i
flog
them
franz
the
policeman
had
been
fairly
quiet
so
far
probably
in
expectation
of
a
good
result
from
intervention
but
now
he
stepped
forward
to
the
door
wearing
just
his
trousers
kneeled
down
hanging
on
to
arm
and
whispered
even
if
you
ca
get
mercy
shown
for
both
of
us
at
least
try
and
get
me
set
free
willem
is
older
than
me
less
sensitive
than
me
in
every
way
he
even
got
a
light
beating
a
couple
of
years
ago
but
my
record
still
clean
i
only
did
things
the
way
i
did
because
willem
led
me
on
to
it
he
been
my
teacher
both
for
good
and
bad
down
in
front
of
the
bank
my
poor
bride
is
waiting
for
me
at
the
entrance
i
so
ashamed
of
myself
it
pitiful
his
face
was
flowing
over
with
tears
and
he
wiped
it
dry
on
coat
i
not
going
to
wait
any
longer
said
the
taking
hold
of
the
cane
in
both
hands
and
laying
in
to
franz
while
willem
cowered
back
in
a
corner
and
looked
on
secretly
not
even
daring
to
turn
his
head
then
the
sudden
scream
that
shot
out
from
franz
was
long
and
irrevocable
it
seemed
to
come
not
from
a
human
being
but
from
an
instrument
that
was
being
tortured
the
whole
corridor
rang
with
it
it
must
have
been
heard
by
everyone
in
the
building
do
shout
like
that
called
out
unable
to
prevent
himself
and
as
he
looked
anxiously
in
the
direction
from
which
the
servitor
would
come
he
gave
franz
a
shove
not
hard
but
hard
enough
for
him
to
fall
down
unconscious
clawing
at
the
ground
with
his
hands
by
reflex
he
still
did
not
avoid
being
hit
the
rod
still
found
him
on
the
floor
the
tip
of
the
rod
swang
regularly
up
and
down
while
he
rolled
to
and
fro
under
its
blows
and
now
one
of
the
servitors
appeared
in
the
distance
with
another
a
few
steps
behind
him
had
quickly
thrown
the
door
shut
gone
over
to
one
of
the
windows
overlooking
the
yard
and
opened
it
the
screams
had
completely
stopped
so
that
the
servitor
would
come
in
he
called
out
it
only
me
good
evening
chief
clerk
somebody
called
back
is
there
anything
wrong
no
no
answered
it
only
a
dog
yelping
in
the
yard
there
was
no
sound
from
the
servitors
so
he
added
you
can
go
back
to
what
you
were
doing
he
did
not
want
to
become
involved
with
a
conversation
with
them
and
so
he
leant
out
of
the
window
a
little
while
later
when
he
looked
out
in
the
corridor
they
had
already
gone
now
remained
at
the
window
he
did
not
dare
go
back
into
the
junk
room
and
he
did
not
want
to
go
home
either
the
yard
he
looked
down
into
was
small
and
rectangular
all
around
it
were
offices
all
the
windows
were
now
dark
and
only
those
at
the
very
top
caught
a
reflection
of
the
moon
k
tried
hard
to
see
into
the
darkness
of
one
corner
of
the
yard
where
a
few
handcarts
had
been
left
behind
one
another
he
felt
anguish
at
not
having
been
able
to
prevent
the
flogging
but
that
was
not
his
fault
if
franz
had
not
screamed
like
that
clearly
it
must
have
caused
a
great
deal
of
pain
but
it
important
to
maintain
control
of
oneself
at
important
moments
if
franz
had
not
screamed
then
it
was
at
least
highly
probable
that
would
have
been
able
to
dissuade
the
if
all
the
junior
officers
were
contemptible
why
would
the
whose
position
was
the
most
inhumane
of
all
be
any
exception
and
had
noticed
very
clearly
how
his
eyes
had
lit
up
when
he
saw
the
banknotes
he
had
obviously
only
seemed
serious
about
the
flogging
to
raise
the
level
of
the
bribe
a
little
and
had
not
been
ungenerous
he
really
had
wanted
to
get
the
policemen
freed
if
he
really
had
now
begun
to
do
something
against
the
degeneracy
of
the
court
then
it
was
a
matter
of
course
that
he
would
have
to
do
something
here
as
well
but
of
course
it
became
impossible
for
him
to
do
anything
as
soon
as
franz
started
screaming
could
not
possibly
have
let
the
junior
bank
staff
and
perhaps
even
all
sorts
of
other
people
come
along
and
catch
him
by
surprise
as
he
haggled
with
those
people
in
the
junk
room
nobody
could
really
expect
that
sort
of
sacrifice
of
him
if
that
had
been
his
intention
then
it
would
almost
have
been
easier
would
have
taken
his
own
clothes
off
and
offered
himself
to
the
in
the
policemen
place
the
would
certainly
not
have
accepted
this
substitution
anyway
as
in
that
way
he
would
have
seriously
violated
his
duty
without
gaining
any
benefit
he
would
most
likely
have
violated
his
duty
twice
over
as
court
employees
were
probably
under
orders
not
to
cause
any
harm
to
while
he
was
facing
charges
although
there
may
have
been
special
conditions
in
force
here
however
things
stood
was
able
to
do
no
more
than
throw
the
door
shut
even
though
that
would
still
do
nothing
to
remove
all
the
dangers
he
faced
it
was
regrettable
that
he
had
given
franz
a
shove
and
it
could
only
be
excused
by
the
heat
of
the
moment
in
the
distance
he
heard
the
steps
of
the
servitors
he
did
not
want
them
to
be
too
aware
of
his
presence
so
he
closed
the
window
and
walked
towards
the
main
staircase
at
the
door
of
the
junk
room
he
stopped
and
listened
for
a
little
while
all
was
silent
the
two
policemen
were
entirely
at
the
mercy
he
could
have
beaten
them
to
death
reached
his
hand
out
for
the
door
handle
but
drew
it
suddenly
back
he
was
no
longer
in
any
position
to
help
anyone
and
the
servitors
would
soon
be
back
he
did
though
promise
himself
that
he
would
raise
the
matter
again
with
somebody
and
see
that
as
far
as
it
was
in
his
power
those
who
really
were
guilty
the
high
officials
whom
nobody
had
so
far
dared
point
out
to
him
received
their
due
punishment
as
he
went
down
the
main
stairway
at
the
front
of
the
bank
he
looked
carefully
round
at
everyone
who
was
passing
but
there
was
no
girl
to
be
seen
who
might
have
been
waiting
for
somebody
not
even
within
some
distance
from
the
bank
franz
claim
that
his
bride
was
waiting
for
him
was
thus
shown
to
be
a
lie
albeit
one
that
was
forgivable
and
intended
only
to
elicit
more
sympathy
the
policemen
were
still
on
mind
all
through
the
following
day
he
was
unable
to
concentrate
on
his
work
and
had
to
stay
in
his
office
a
little
longer
than
the
previous
day
so
that
he
could
finish
it
on
the
way
home
as
he
passed
by
the
junk
room
again
he
opened
its
door
as
if
that
had
been
his
habit
instead
of
the
darkness
he
expected
he
saw
everything
unchanged
from
the
previous
evening
and
did
not
know
how
he
should
respond
everything
was
exactly
the
same
as
he
had
seen
it
when
he
had
opened
the
door
the
previous
evening
the
forms
and
bottles
of
ink
just
inside
the
doorway
the
with
his
cane
the
two
policemen
still
undressed
the
candle
on
the
shelf
and
the
two
policemen
began
to
wail
and
call
out
mr
slammed
the
door
immediately
shut
and
even
thumped
on
it
with
his
fists
as
if
that
would
shut
it
all
the
firmer
almost
in
tears
he
ran
to
the
servitors
working
quietly
at
the
copying
machine
go
and
get
that
junk
room
cleared
out
he
shouted
and
in
amazement
they
stopped
what
they
were
doing
it
should
have
been
done
long
ago
we
sinking
in
dirt
they
would
be
able
to
do
the
job
the
next
day
nodded
it
was
too
late
in
the
evening
to
make
them
do
it
there
and
then
as
he
had
originally
intended
he
sat
down
briefly
in
order
to
keep
them
near
him
for
a
little
longer
looked
through
a
few
of
the
copies
to
give
the
impression
that
he
was
checking
them
and
then
as
he
saw
that
they
would
not
dare
to
leave
at
the
same
time
as
himself
went
home
tired
and
with
his
mind
numb
chapter
six
uncle
leni
one
afternoon
was
very
busy
at
the
time
getting
the
post
ready
uncle
karl
a
small
country
land
owner
came
into
the
room
pushing
his
way
between
two
of
the
staff
who
were
bringing
in
some
papers
had
long
expected
his
uncle
to
appear
but
the
sight
of
him
now
shocked
far
less
than
the
prospect
of
it
had
done
a
long
time
before
his
uncle
was
bound
to
come
had
been
sure
of
that
for
about
a
month
he
already
thought
at
the
time
he
could
see
how
his
uncle
would
arrive
slightly
bowed
his
battered
panama
hat
in
his
left
hand
his
right
hand
already
stretched
out
over
the
desk
long
before
he
was
close
enough
as
he
rushed
carelessly
towards
knocking
over
everything
that
was
in
his
way
uncle
was
always
in
a
hurry
as
he
suffered
from
the
unfortunate
belief
that
he
had
a
number
things
to
do
while
he
was
in
the
big
city
and
had
to
settle
all
of
them
in
one
day
his
visits
were
only
ever
for
one
day
and
at
the
same
time
thought
he
could
not
forgo
any
conversation
or
piece
of
business
or
pleasure
that
might
arise
by
chance
uncle
karl
was
former
guardian
and
so
was
to
help
him
in
all
of
this
as
well
as
to
offer
him
a
bed
for
the
night
haunted
by
a
ghost
from
the
country
he
would
say
as
soon
as
they
had
greeted
each
other
had
invited
him
to
sit
in
the
armchair
but
uncle
karl
had
no
time
for
that
he
said
he
wanted
to
speak
briefly
with
in
private
it
is
necessary
he
said
with
a
tired
gulp
it
is
necessary
for
my
peace
of
mind
immediately
sent
the
junior
staff
from
the
room
and
told
them
to
let
in
what
this
that
i
been
hearing
josef
cried
uncle
when
they
were
alone
as
he
sat
on
the
table
shoving
various
papers
under
himself
without
looking
at
them
to
make
himself
more
comfortable
said
nothing
he
knew
what
was
coming
but
suddenly
relieved
from
the
effort
of
the
work
he
had
been
doing
he
gave
way
to
a
pleasant
lassitude
and
looked
out
the
window
at
the
other
side
of
the
street
from
where
he
sat
he
could
see
just
a
small
triangular
section
of
it
part
of
the
empty
walls
of
houses
between
two
shop
windows
you
staring
out
the
window
called
out
his
uncle
raising
his
arms
for
god
sake
josef
give
me
an
answer
is
it
true
can
it
really
be
true
uncle
karl
said
wrenching
himself
back
from
his
daydreaming
i
really
know
what
it
is
you
want
of
me
josef
said
his
uncle
in
a
warning
tone
as
far
as
i
know
you
always
told
the
truth
am
i
to
take
what
you
just
said
as
a
bad
sign
i
think
i
know
what
it
is
you
want
said
obediently
i
expect
you
heard
about
my
trial
that
right
answered
his
uncle
with
a
slow
nod
i
heard
about
your
trial
who
did
you
hear
it
from
then
asked
erna
wrote
to
me
said
his
uncle
she
does
have
much
contact
with
you
it
true
you
do
pay
very
much
attention
to
her
i
afraid
to
say
but
she
learned
about
it
nonetheless
i
got
her
letter
today
and
of
course
i
came
straight
here
and
for
no
other
reason
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
reason
enough
i
can
read
you
out
the
part
of
the
letter
that
concerns
you
he
drew
the
letter
out
from
his
wallet
here
it
is
she
writes
have
not
seen
josef
for
a
long
time
i
was
in
the
bank
last
week
but
josef
was
so
busy
that
they
would
not
let
me
through
i
waited
there
for
nearly
an
hour
but
then
i
had
to
go
home
as
i
had
my
piano
lesson
i
would
have
liked
to
have
spoken
to
him
maybe
there
will
be
a
chance
another
time
he
sent
me
a
big
box
of
chocolates
for
my
that
was
very
nice
and
attentive
of
him
i
forgot
to
tell
you
about
it
when
i
wrote
and
i
only
remember
now
that
you
ask
me
about
it
chocolate
as
i
am
sure
you
are
aware
disappears
straight
away
in
this
lodging
house
almost
as
soon
as
you
know
somebody
has
given
you
chocolate
it
is
gone
but
there
is
something
else
i
wanted
to
tell
you
about
josef
like
i
said
they
would
not
let
me
through
to
see
him
at
the
bank
because
he
was
negotiating
with
some
gentleman
just
then
after
i
had
been
waiting
quietly
for
quite
a
long
time
i
asked
one
of
the
staff
whether
his
meeting
would
last
much
longer
he
said
it
might
well
do
as
it
was
probably
about
the
legal
proceedings
he
said
that
were
being
conducted
against
him
i
asked
what
sort
of
legal
proceedings
it
was
that
were
being
conducted
against
the
chief
clerk
and
whether
he
was
not
making
some
mistake
but
he
said
he
was
not
making
any
mistake
there
were
legal
proceedings
underway
and
even
that
they
were
about
something
quite
serious
but
he
did
not
know
any
more
about
it
he
would
have
liked
to
have
been
of
some
help
to
the
chief
clerk
himself
as
the
chief
clerk
was
a
gentleman
good
and
honest
but
he
did
not
know
what
it
was
he
could
do
and
merely
hoped
there
would
be
some
influential
gentlemen
who
would
take
his
side
i
sure
that
is
what
will
happen
and
that
everything
will
turn
out
for
the
best
in
the
end
but
in
the
mean
time
things
do
not
look
at
all
good
and
you
can
see
that
from
the
mood
of
the
chief
clerk
himself
of
course
i
did
not
place
too
much
importance
on
this
conversation
and
even
did
my
best
to
put
the
bank
clerk
mind
at
rest
he
was
quite
a
simple
man
i
told
him
he
was
not
to
speak
to
anyone
else
about
this
and
i
think
it
is
all
just
a
rumour
but
i
still
think
it
might
be
good
if
you
dear
father
if
you
looked
into
the
matter
the
next
time
you
visit
it
will
be
easy
for
you
to
find
out
more
detail
and
if
it
is
really
necessary
to
do
something
about
it
through
the
great
and
influential
people
you
know
but
if
it
is
not
necessary
and
that
is
what
seems
most
likely
then
at
least
your
daughter
will
soon
have
the
chance
to
embrace
you
and
i
look
forward
to
it
she
a
good
child
said
uncle
when
he
had
finished
reading
and
wiped
a
few
tears
from
his
eyes
nodded
with
all
the
different
disruptions
he
had
had
recently
he
had
completely
forgotten
about
erna
even
her
birthday
and
the
story
of
the
chocolates
had
clearly
just
been
invented
so
that
he
would
get
in
trouble
with
his
aunt
and
uncle
it
was
very
touching
and
even
the
theatre
tickets
which
he
would
regularly
send
her
from
then
on
would
not
be
enough
to
repay
her
but
he
really
did
not
feel
now
that
it
was
right
for
him
to
visit
her
in
her
lodgings
and
hold
conversations
with
a
little
eighteen
year
old
schoolgirl
and
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
that
asked
his
uncle
who
had
forgotten
all
his
rush
and
excitement
as
he
read
the
letter
and
seemed
to
be
about
to
read
it
again
yes
uncle
said
it
is
true
true
called
out
his
uncle
what
is
true
how
can
this
be
true
what
sort
of
trial
is
it
not
a
criminal
trial
i
hope
it
a
criminal
trial
answered
and
you
sit
quietly
here
while
you
got
a
criminal
trial
round
your
neck
shouted
his
uncle
getting
ever
louder
the
more
calm
i
am
the
better
it
will
be
for
the
outcome
said
in
a
tired
voice
do
worry
how
can
i
help
worrying
shouted
his
uncle
josef
my
dear
josef
think
about
yourself
about
your
family
think
about
our
good
name
up
till
now
you
always
been
our
pride
do
now
become
our
disgrace
i
like
the
way
you
behaving
he
said
looking
at
with
his
head
at
an
angle
that
not
how
an
innocent
man
behaves
when
he
accused
of
something
not
if
he
still
got
any
strength
in
him
just
tell
me
what
it
all
about
so
that
i
can
help
you
it
something
to
do
with
the
bank
i
take
it
no
said
as
he
stood
up
and
you
speaking
too
loud
uncle
i
expect
one
of
the
staff
is
listening
at
the
door
and
i
find
that
rather
unpleasant
it
best
if
we
go
somewhere
else
then
i
can
answer
all
your
questions
as
far
as
i
can
and
i
know
very
well
that
i
have
to
account
to
the
family
for
what
i
do
you
certainly
do
his
uncle
shouted
quite
right
you
do
now
just
get
a
move
on
josef
hurry
up
now
i
still
have
a
few
documents
i
need
to
prepare
said
and
using
the
intercom
he
summoned
his
deputy
who
entered
a
few
moments
later
uncle
still
angry
and
excited
gestured
with
his
hand
to
show
that
had
summoned
him
even
though
there
was
no
need
whatever
to
do
so
stood
in
front
of
the
desk
and
explained
to
the
young
man
who
listened
calm
and
attentive
what
would
need
to
be
done
that
day
in
his
absence
speaking
in
a
calm
voice
and
making
use
of
various
documents
the
presence
of
uncle
while
this
was
going
on
was
quite
disturbing
he
did
not
listen
to
what
was
being
said
but
at
first
he
stood
there
with
eyes
wide
open
and
nervously
biting
his
lips
then
he
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
stopped
now
and
then
at
the
window
or
stood
in
front
of
a
picture
always
making
various
exclamations
such
as
that
is
totally
incomprehensible
to
me
or
now
just
tell
me
what
are
you
supposed
to
make
of
that
the
young
man
pretended
to
notice
nothing
of
this
and
listened
to
instructions
through
to
the
end
he
made
a
few
notes
bowed
to
both
and
his
uncle
and
then
left
the
room
uncle
had
turned
his
back
to
him
and
was
looking
out
the
window
bunching
up
the
curtains
with
his
outstretched
hands
the
door
had
hardly
closed
when
he
called
out
at
last
now
that
he
stopped
jumping
about
we
can
go
too
once
they
were
in
the
front
hall
of
the
bank
where
several
members
of
staff
were
standing
about
and
where
just
then
the
deputy
director
was
walking
across
there
was
unfortunately
no
way
of
stopping
uncle
from
continually
asking
questions
about
the
trial
now
then
josef
he
began
lightly
acknowledging
the
bows
from
those
around
them
as
they
passed
tell
me
everything
about
this
trial
what
sort
of
trial
is
it
made
a
few
comments
which
conveyed
little
information
even
laughed
a
little
and
it
was
only
when
they
reached
the
front
steps
that
he
explained
to
his
uncle
that
he
had
not
wanted
to
talk
openly
in
front
of
those
people
quite
right
said
his
uncle
but
now
start
talking
with
his
head
to
one
side
and
smoking
his
cigar
in
short
impatient
draughts
he
listened
first
of
all
uncle
said
it
not
a
trial
like
have
in
a
normal
courtroom
so
much
the
worse
said
his
uncle
how
that
asked
looking
at
him
what
i
mean
is
that
for
the
worse
he
repeated
they
were
standing
on
the
front
steps
of
the
bank
as
the
doorkeeper
seemed
to
be
listening
to
what
they
were
saying
drew
his
uncle
down
further
where
they
were
absorbed
into
the
bustle
of
the
street
his
uncle
took
arm
and
stopped
asking
questions
with
such
urgency
about
the
trial
they
walked
on
for
a
while
in
silence
but
how
did
all
this
come
about
he
eventually
asked
stopping
abruptly
enough
to
startle
the
people
walking
behind
who
had
to
avoid
walking
into
him
things
like
this
do
come
all
of
a
sudden
they
start
developing
a
long
time
beforehand
there
must
have
been
warning
signs
of
it
why
did
you
write
to
me
you
know
i
do
anything
for
you
to
some
extent
i
am
still
your
guardian
and
until
today
something
i
was
proud
of
i
still
help
you
of
course
i
will
only
now
now
that
the
trial
is
already
underway
it
makes
it
very
difficult
but
whatever
the
best
thing
now
is
for
you
to
take
a
short
holiday
staying
with
us
in
the
country
you
lost
weight
i
can
see
that
now
the
country
life
will
give
you
strength
that
will
be
good
bound
to
be
a
lot
of
hard
work
ahead
of
you
but
besides
that
it
be
a
way
of
getting
you
away
from
the
court
to
some
extent
here
got
every
means
of
showing
the
powers
at
their
disposal
and
automatically
bound
to
use
them
against
you
in
the
country
either
have
to
delegate
authority
to
different
bodies
or
just
have
to
try
and
bother
you
by
letter
telegram
or
telephone
and
that
bound
to
weaken
the
effect
it
wo
release
you
from
them
but
it
give
you
room
to
breathe
you
could
forbid
me
to
leave
said
who
had
been
drawn
slightly
into
his
uncle
way
of
thinking
by
what
he
had
been
saying
i
did
think
you
would
do
it
said
his
uncle
thoughtfully
you
wo
suffer
too
much
loss
of
power
by
moving
away
grasped
his
uncle
under
the
arm
to
prevent
him
stopping
still
and
said
i
thought
you
think
all
this
is
less
important
than
i
do
and
now
taking
it
so
hard
josef
called
his
uncle
trying
to
disentangle
himself
from
him
so
that
he
could
stop
walking
but
did
not
let
go
you
completely
changed
you
used
to
be
so
astute
are
you
losing
it
now
do
you
want
to
lose
the
trial
do
you
realise
what
that
would
mean
that
would
mean
you
would
be
simply
destroyed
and
that
everyone
you
know
would
be
pulled
down
with
you
or
at
the
very
least
humiliated
disgraced
right
down
to
the
ground
josef
pull
yourself
together
the
way
you
so
indifferent
about
it
it
driving
me
mad
looking
at
you
i
can
almost
believe
that
old
saying
a
trial
like
that
means
losing
a
trial
like
that
my
dear
uncle
said
it
wo
do
any
good
to
get
excited
it
no
good
for
you
to
do
it
and
it
be
no
good
for
me
to
do
it
the
case
wo
be
won
by
getting
excited
and
please
admit
that
my
practical
experience
counts
for
something
just
as
i
have
always
and
still
do
respect
your
experience
even
when
it
surprises
me
you
say
that
the
family
will
also
be
affected
by
this
trial
i
really
ca
see
how
but
that
beside
the
point
and
i
quite
willing
to
follow
your
instructions
in
all
of
this
only
i
do
see
any
advantage
in
staying
in
the
country
not
even
for
you
as
that
would
indicate
flight
and
a
sense
of
guilt
and
besides
although
i
am
more
subject
to
persecution
if
i
stay
in
the
city
i
can
also
press
the
matter
forward
better
here
you
right
said
his
uncle
in
a
tone
that
seemed
to
indicate
they
were
finally
coming
closer
to
each
other
i
just
made
the
suggestion
because
as
i
saw
it
if
you
stay
in
the
city
the
case
will
be
put
in
danger
by
your
indifference
to
it
and
i
thought
it
was
better
if
i
did
the
work
for
you
but
will
you
push
things
forward
yourself
with
all
your
strength
if
so
that
will
naturally
be
far
better
we
agreed
then
said
and
do
you
have
any
suggestions
for
what
i
should
do
next
well
naturally
i
have
to
think
about
it
said
his
uncle
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
i
been
living
in
the
country
for
twenty
years
now
almost
without
a
break
you
lose
your
ability
to
deal
with
matters
like
this
but
i
do
have
some
important
connections
with
several
people
who
i
expect
know
their
way
around
these
things
better
than
i
do
and
to
contact
them
is
a
matter
of
course
out
there
in
the
country
i
been
getting
out
of
condition
i
sure
you
already
aware
of
that
it
only
at
times
like
this
that
you
notice
it
yourself
and
this
affair
of
yours
came
largely
unexpected
although
oddly
enough
i
had
expected
something
of
the
sort
after
i
read
erna
letter
and
today
when
i
saw
your
face
i
knew
it
with
almost
total
certainty
but
all
that
is
by
the
by
the
important
thing
now
is
we
have
no
time
to
lose
even
while
he
was
still
speaking
uncle
had
stood
on
tiptoe
to
summon
a
taxi
and
now
he
pulled
into
the
car
behind
himself
as
he
called
out
an
address
to
the
driver
we
going
now
to
see
huld
the
lawyer
he
said
we
were
at
school
together
i
sure
you
know
the
name
do
you
no
well
that
is
odd
he
got
a
very
good
reputation
as
a
defence
barrister
and
for
working
with
the
poor
but
i
esteem
him
especially
as
someone
you
can
trust
it
alright
with
me
whatever
you
do
said
although
he
was
made
uneasy
by
the
rushed
and
urgent
way
his
uncle
was
dealing
with
the
matter
it
was
not
very
encouraging
as
the
accused
be
to
taken
to
a
lawyer
for
poor
people
i
did
know
he
said
that
you
could
take
on
a
lawyer
in
matters
like
this
well
of
course
you
can
said
his
uncle
that
goes
without
saying
why
would
you
take
on
a
lawyer
and
now
so
that
i
properly
instructed
in
this
matter
tell
me
what
been
happening
so
far
instantly
began
telling
his
uncle
about
what
had
been
happening
holding
nothing
back
being
completely
open
with
him
was
the
only
way
that
could
protest
at
his
uncle
belief
that
the
trial
was
a
great
disgrace
he
mentioned
miss
b√ºrstner
name
just
once
and
in
passing
but
that
did
nothing
to
diminish
his
openness
about
the
trial
as
miss
b√ºrstner
had
no
connection
with
it
as
he
spoke
he
looked
out
the
window
and
saw
how
just
then
they
were
getting
closer
to
the
suburb
where
the
court
offices
were
he
drew
this
to
his
uncle
attention
but
he
did
not
find
the
coincidence
especially
remarkable
the
taxi
stopped
in
front
of
a
dark
building
uncle
knocked
at
the
very
first
door
at
ground
level
while
they
waited
he
smiled
showing
his
big
teeth
and
whispered
eight
not
the
usual
sort
of
time
to
be
visiting
a
lawyer
but
huld
wo
mind
it
from
me
two
large
black
eyes
appeared
in
the
in
the
door
they
stared
at
the
two
visitors
for
a
while
and
then
disappeared
the
door
however
did
not
open
and
his
uncle
confirmed
to
each
other
the
fact
that
they
had
seen
the
two
eyes
a
new
maid
afraid
of
strangers
said
uncle
and
knocked
again
the
eyes
appeared
once
more
this
time
they
seemed
almost
sad
but
the
open
gas
flame
that
burned
with
a
hiss
close
above
their
heads
gave
off
little
light
and
that
may
have
merely
created
an
illusion
open
the
door
called
uncle
raising
his
fist
against
it
we
are
friends
of
huld
the
lawyer
huld
is
ill
whispered
someone
behind
them
in
a
doorway
at
the
far
end
of
a
narrow
passage
stood
a
man
in
his
dressing
gown
giving
them
this
information
in
an
extremely
quiet
voice
uncle
who
had
already
been
made
very
angry
by
the
long
wait
turned
abruptly
round
and
retorted
ill
you
say
he
ill
and
strode
towards
the
gentleman
in
a
way
that
seemed
almost
threatening
as
if
he
were
the
illness
himself
they
opened
the
door
for
you
now
said
the
gentleman
pointing
at
the
door
of
the
lawyer
he
pulled
his
dressing
gown
together
and
disappeared
the
door
had
indeed
been
opened
a
young
girl
recognised
the
dark
slightly
bulging
eyes
stood
in
the
hallway
in
a
long
white
apron
holding
a
candle
in
her
hand
next
time
open
up
sooner
said
uncle
instead
of
a
greeting
while
the
girl
made
a
slight
curtsey
come
along
josef
he
then
said
to
who
was
slowly
moving
over
towards
the
girl
huld
is
unwell
said
the
girl
as
uncle
without
stopping
rushed
towards
one
of
the
doors
continued
to
look
at
the
girl
in
amazement
as
she
turned
round
to
block
the
way
into
the
living
room
she
had
a
round
face
like
a
puppy
not
only
the
pale
cheeks
and
the
chin
were
round
but
the
temples
and
the
hairline
were
too
josef
called
his
uncle
once
more
and
he
asked
the
girl
it
trouble
with
his
heart
is
it
i
think
it
is
sir
said
the
girl
who
by
now
had
found
time
to
go
ahead
with
the
candle
and
open
the
door
into
the
room
in
one
corner
of
the
room
where
the
light
of
the
candle
did
not
reach
a
face
with
a
long
beard
looked
up
from
the
bed
leni
who
this
coming
in
asked
the
lawyer
unable
to
recognise
his
guests
because
he
was
dazzled
by
the
candle
it
your
old
friend
albert
said
uncle
oh
albert
said
the
lawyer
falling
back
onto
his
pillow
as
if
this
visit
meant
he
would
not
need
to
keep
up
appearances
is
it
really
as
bad
as
that
asked
uncle
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
i
do
believe
it
is
it
a
recurrence
of
your
heart
trouble
and
it
pass
over
like
the
other
times
maybe
said
the
lawyer
quietly
but
it
just
as
much
trouble
as
it
ever
been
i
can
hardly
breathe
i
ca
sleep
at
all
and
i
getting
weaker
by
the
day
i
see
said
uncle
pressing
his
panama
hat
firmly
against
his
knee
with
his
big
hand
that
is
bad
news
but
are
you
getting
the
right
sort
of
care
and
it
so
depressing
in
here
it
so
dark
it
a
long
time
since
i
was
last
here
but
it
seemed
to
me
friendlier
then
even
your
young
lady
here
does
seem
to
have
much
life
in
her
unless
she
just
pretending
the
maid
was
still
standing
by
the
door
with
the
candle
as
far
as
could
be
made
out
she
was
watching
more
than
she
was
watching
his
uncle
even
while
the
latter
was
still
speaking
about
her
leant
against
a
chair
that
he
had
pushed
near
to
the
girl
when
you
as
ill
as
i
am
said
the
lawyer
you
need
to
have
peace
i
do
find
it
depressing
after
a
short
pause
he
added
and
leni
looks
after
me
well
she
a
good
girl
but
that
was
not
enough
to
persuade
uncle
he
had
visibly
taken
against
his
friend
carer
and
even
though
he
did
not
contradict
the
invalid
he
persecuted
her
with
his
scowl
as
she
went
over
to
the
bed
put
the
candle
on
the
bedside
table
and
leaning
over
the
bed
made
a
fuss
of
him
by
tidying
the
pillows
uncle
nearly
forgot
the
need
to
show
any
consideration
for
the
man
who
lay
ill
in
bed
he
stood
up
walked
up
and
down
behind
the
carer
and
would
not
have
been
surprised
if
he
had
grabbed
hold
of
her
skirts
behind
her
and
dragged
her
away
from
the
bed
himself
looked
on
calmly
he
was
not
even
disappointed
at
finding
the
lawyer
unwell
he
had
been
able
to
do
nothing
to
oppose
the
enthusiasm
his
uncle
had
developed
for
the
matter
he
was
glad
that
this
enthusiasm
had
now
been
distracted
without
his
having
to
do
anything
about
it
his
uncle
probably
simply
wishing
to
be
offensive
to
the
attendant
then
said
young
lady
now
please
leave
us
alone
for
a
while
i
have
some
personal
matters
to
discuss
with
my
friend
huld
carer
was
still
leant
far
over
the
invalid
bed
and
smoothing
out
the
cloth
covering
the
wall
next
to
it
she
merely
turned
her
head
and
then
in
striking
contrast
with
the
anger
that
first
stopped
uncle
from
speaking
and
then
let
the
words
out
in
a
gush
she
said
very
quietly
you
can
see
that
huld
is
so
ill
that
he
ca
discuss
any
matters
at
all
it
was
probably
just
for
the
sake
of
convenience
that
she
had
repeated
the
words
spoken
by
uncle
but
an
onlooker
might
even
have
perceived
it
as
mocking
him
and
he
of
course
jumped
up
as
if
he
had
just
been
stabbed
you
damned
in
the
first
gurglings
of
his
excitement
his
words
could
hardly
be
understood
was
startled
even
though
he
had
been
expecting
something
of
the
sort
and
ran
to
his
uncle
with
the
intention
no
doubt
of
closing
his
mouth
with
both
his
hands
fortunately
though
behind
the
girl
the
invalid
raised
himself
up
uncle
made
an
ugly
face
as
if
swallowing
something
disgusting
and
then
somewhat
calmer
said
we
have
naturally
not
lost
our
senses
not
yet
if
what
i
am
asking
for
were
not
possible
i
would
not
be
asking
for
it
now
please
go
the
carer
stood
up
straight
by
the
bed
directly
facing
uncle
thought
he
noticed
that
with
one
hand
she
was
stroking
the
lawyer
hand
you
can
say
anything
in
front
of
leni
said
the
invalid
in
a
tone
that
was
unmistakably
imploring
it
not
my
business
said
uncle
and
it
not
my
secrets
and
he
twisted
himself
round
as
if
wanting
to
go
into
no
more
negotiations
but
giving
himself
a
little
more
time
to
think
whose
business
is
it
then
asked
the
lawyer
in
an
exhausted
voice
as
he
leant
back
again
my
nephew
said
uncle
and
i
brought
him
along
with
me
and
he
introduced
him
chief
clerk
josef
oh
said
the
invalid
now
with
much
more
life
in
him
and
reached
out
his
hand
towards
do
forgive
me
i
did
notice
you
there
at
all
then
he
then
said
to
his
carer
leni
go
stretching
his
hand
out
to
her
as
if
this
were
a
farewell
that
would
have
to
last
for
a
long
time
this
time
the
girl
offered
no
resistance
so
you
he
finally
said
to
uncle
who
had
also
calmed
down
and
stepped
closer
you
have
come
to
visit
me
because
i
ill
but
you
come
on
business
the
lawyer
now
looked
so
much
stronger
that
it
seemed
the
idea
of
being
visited
because
he
was
ill
had
somehow
made
him
weak
he
remained
supporting
himself
of
one
elbow
which
must
have
been
rather
tiring
and
continually
pulled
at
a
lock
of
hair
in
the
middle
of
his
beard
you
already
look
much
better
said
uncle
now
that
that
witch
has
gone
outside
he
interrupted
himself
whispered
i
bet
you
she
listening
and
sprang
over
to
the
door
but
behind
the
door
there
was
uncle
came
back
not
disappointed
as
her
not
listening
seemed
to
him
worse
than
if
she
had
been
but
probably
somewhat
embittered
you
mistaken
about
her
said
the
lawyer
but
did
nothing
more
to
defend
her
perhaps
that
was
his
way
of
indicating
that
she
did
not
need
defending
but
in
a
tone
that
was
much
more
committed
he
went
on
as
far
as
your
affairs
are
concerned
this
will
be
an
extremely
difficult
undertaking
and
i
count
myself
lucky
if
my
strength
lasted
out
long
enough
for
it
i
greatly
afraid
it
wo
do
but
anyway
i
do
want
to
leave
anything
untried
if
i
do
last
out
you
can
always
get
somebody
else
to
be
honest
this
matter
interests
me
too
much
and
i
ca
bring
myself
to
give
up
the
chance
of
taking
some
part
in
it
if
my
heart
does
totally
give
out
then
at
least
it
will
have
found
a
worthy
affair
to
fail
in
believed
he
understood
not
a
word
of
this
entire
speech
he
looked
at
his
uncle
for
an
explanation
but
his
uncle
sat
on
the
bedside
table
with
the
candle
in
his
hand
a
medicine
bottle
had
rolled
off
the
table
onto
the
floor
he
nodded
to
everything
the
lawyer
said
agreed
to
everything
and
now
and
then
looked
at
urging
him
to
show
the
same
compliance
maybe
uncle
had
already
told
the
lawyer
about
the
trial
but
that
was
impossible
everything
that
had
happened
so
far
spoke
against
it
so
he
said
i
do
understand
well
maybe
i
misunderstood
what
been
saying
said
the
lawyer
just
as
astonished
and
embarrassed
as
perhaps
i
been
going
too
fast
what
was
it
you
wanted
to
speak
to
me
about
i
thought
it
was
to
do
with
your
trial
of
course
it
is
said
uncle
who
then
asked
so
what
is
it
you
want
yes
but
how
is
it
that
you
know
anything
about
me
and
my
case
asked
oh
i
see
said
the
lawyer
with
a
smile
i
am
a
lawyer
i
move
in
court
circles
people
talk
about
various
different
cases
and
the
more
interesting
ones
stay
in
your
mind
especially
when
they
concern
the
nephew
of
a
friend
there
nothing
very
remarkable
about
that
what
is
it
you
want
then
asked
uncle
once
more
you
seem
so
uneasy
about
it
you
move
in
this
court
circles
asked
yes
said
the
lawyer
you
asking
questions
like
a
child
said
uncle
what
circles
should
i
move
in
then
if
not
with
members
of
my
own
discipline
the
lawyer
added
it
sounded
so
indisputable
that
gave
no
answer
at
all
but
you
work
in
the
high
court
not
that
court
in
the
attic
he
had
wanted
to
say
but
could
not
bring
himself
to
actually
utter
it
you
have
to
realise
the
lawyer
continued
in
a
tone
as
if
he
were
explaining
something
obvious
unnecessary
and
incidental
you
have
to
realise
that
i
also
derive
great
advantage
for
my
clients
from
mixing
with
those
people
and
do
so
in
many
different
ways
it
not
something
you
can
keep
talking
about
all
the
time
i
at
a
bit
of
a
disadvantage
now
of
course
because
of
my
illness
but
i
still
get
visits
from
some
good
friends
of
mine
at
the
court
and
i
learn
one
or
two
things
it
might
even
be
that
i
learn
more
than
many
of
those
who
are
in
the
best
of
health
and
spend
all
day
in
court
and
i
receiving
a
very
welcome
visit
right
now
for
instance
and
he
pointed
into
a
dark
corner
of
the
room
where
asked
almost
uncouth
in
his
surprise
he
looked
round
uneasily
the
little
candle
gave
off
far
too
little
light
to
reach
as
far
as
the
wall
opposite
and
then
something
did
indeed
begin
to
move
there
in
the
corner
in
the
light
of
the
candle
held
up
by
uncle
an
elderly
gentleman
could
be
seen
sitting
beside
a
small
table
he
had
been
sitting
there
for
so
long
without
being
noticed
that
he
could
hardly
have
been
breathing
now
he
stood
up
with
a
great
deal
of
fuss
clearly
unhappy
that
attention
had
been
drawn
to
him
it
was
as
if
by
flapping
his
hands
about
like
short
wings
he
hoped
to
deflect
any
introductions
and
greetings
as
if
he
wanted
on
no
account
to
disturb
the
others
by
his
presence
and
seemed
to
be
exhorting
them
to
leave
him
back
in
the
dark
and
forget
about
his
being
there
that
however
was
something
that
could
no
longer
be
granted
him
you
took
us
by
surprise
you
see
said
the
lawyer
in
explanation
cheerfully
indicating
to
the
gentleman
that
he
should
come
closer
which
slowly
hesitatingly
looking
all
around
him
but
with
a
certain
dignity
he
did
the
office
director
oh
yes
forgive
me
i
introduced
you
this
is
my
friend
albert
this
is
his
nephew
the
chief
clerk
josef
and
this
is
the
office
director
so
the
office
director
was
kind
enough
to
pay
me
a
visit
it
only
possible
to
appreciate
just
how
valuable
a
visit
like
this
is
if
you
been
let
into
the
secret
of
what
a
pile
of
work
the
office
director
has
heaped
over
him
well
he
came
anyway
we
were
having
a
peaceful
chat
as
far
as
i
was
able
when
i
so
weak
and
although
we
had
told
leni
she
must
let
anyone
in
as
we
were
expecting
anyone
we
still
would
rather
have
remained
alone
but
then
along
came
you
albert
thumping
your
fists
on
the
door
the
office
director
moved
over
into
the
corner
pulling
his
table
and
chair
with
him
but
now
it
turns
out
we
might
have
that
is
if
that
what
you
wish
we
might
have
something
to
discuss
with
each
other
and
it
would
be
good
if
we
can
all
come
back
together
again
office
director
he
said
with
his
head
on
one
side
pointing
with
a
humble
smile
to
an
armchair
near
the
bed
afraid
i
only
be
able
to
stay
a
few
minutes
more
smiled
the
office
director
as
he
spread
himself
out
in
the
armchair
and
looked
at
the
clock
business
calls
but
i
would
want
to
miss
the
chance
of
meeting
a
friend
of
my
friend
he
inclined
his
head
slightly
toward
uncle
who
seemed
very
happy
with
his
new
acquaintance
but
he
was
not
the
sort
of
person
to
express
his
feelings
of
deference
and
responded
to
the
office
director
words
with
embarrassed
but
loud
laughter
a
horrible
sight
was
able
to
quietly
watch
everything
as
nobody
paid
any
attention
to
him
the
office
director
took
over
as
leader
of
the
conversation
as
seemed
to
be
his
habit
once
he
had
been
called
forward
the
lawyer
listened
attentively
with
his
hand
to
his
ear
his
initial
weakness
having
perhaps
only
had
the
function
of
driving
away
his
new
visitors
uncle
served
as
balancing
the
candle
on
his
thigh
while
the
office
director
frequently
glanced
nervously
at
it
and
was
soon
free
of
his
embarrassment
and
was
quickly
enchanted
not
only
by
the
office
director
speaking
manner
but
also
by
the
gentle
waving
with
which
he
accompanied
it
leaning
against
the
bedpost
was
totally
ignored
by
the
office
director
perhaps
deliberately
and
served
the
old
man
only
as
audience
and
besides
he
had
hardly
any
idea
what
the
conversation
was
about
and
his
thoughts
soon
turned
to
the
care
assistant
and
the
ill
treatment
she
had
suffered
from
his
uncle
soon
after
he
began
to
wonder
whether
he
had
not
seen
the
office
director
somewhere
before
perhaps
among
the
people
who
were
at
his
first
hearing
he
may
have
been
mistaken
but
thought
the
office
director
might
well
have
been
among
the
old
gentlemen
with
the
thin
beards
in
the
first
row
there
was
then
a
noise
that
everyone
heard
from
the
hallway
as
if
something
of
porcelain
were
being
broken
i
go
and
see
happened
said
who
slowly
left
the
room
as
if
giving
the
others
the
chance
to
stop
him
he
had
hardly
stepped
into
the
hallway
finding
his
bearings
in
the
darkness
with
his
hand
still
firmly
holding
the
door
when
another
small
hand
much
smaller
than
own
placed
itself
on
his
and
gently
shut
the
door
it
was
the
carer
who
had
been
waiting
there
nothing
has
happened
she
whispered
to
him
i
just
threw
a
plate
against
the
wall
to
get
you
out
of
there
i
was
thinking
about
you
as
well
replied
uneasily
so
much
the
better
said
the
carer
come
with
me
a
few
steps
along
they
came
to
a
frosted
glass
door
which
the
carer
opened
for
him
come
in
here
she
said
it
was
clearly
the
lawyer
office
fitted
out
with
old
heavy
furniture
as
far
as
could
be
seen
in
the
moonlight
which
now
illuminated
just
a
small
rectangular
section
of
the
floor
by
each
of
the
three
big
windows
this
way
said
the
carer
pointing
to
a
dark
trunk
with
a
carved
wooden
backrest
when
he
had
sat
down
continued
to
look
round
the
room
it
was
a
large
room
with
a
high
ceiling
the
clients
of
this
lawyer
for
the
poor
must
have
felt
quite
lost
in
it
thought
he
could
see
the
little
steps
with
which
visitors
would
approach
the
massive
desk
but
then
he
forgot
about
all
of
this
and
had
eyes
only
for
the
carer
who
sat
very
close
beside
him
almost
pressing
him
against
the
armrest
i
did
think
she
said
you
would
come
out
here
to
me
by
yourself
without
me
having
to
call
you
first
it
was
odd
first
you
stare
at
me
as
soon
as
you
come
in
and
then
you
keep
me
waiting
and
you
ought
to
call
me
leni
too
she
added
quickly
and
suddenly
as
if
no
moment
of
this
conversation
should
be
lost
gladly
said
but
as
for
its
being
odd
leni
that
easy
to
explain
firstly
i
had
to
listen
to
what
the
old
men
were
saying
and
could
leave
without
a
good
reason
but
secondly
i
not
a
bold
person
if
anything
i
quite
shy
and
you
leni
you
did
really
look
like
you
could
be
won
over
in
one
stroke
either
that
not
it
said
leni
laying
one
arm
on
the
armrest
and
looking
at
you
did
like
me
and
i
do
suppose
you
like
me
now
either
liking
would
be
very
much
said
evasively
oh
she
exclaimed
with
a
smile
thus
making
use
of
comment
to
gain
an
advantage
over
him
so
remained
silent
for
a
while
by
now
he
had
become
used
to
the
darkness
in
the
room
and
was
able
to
make
out
various
fixtures
and
fittings
he
was
especially
impressed
by
a
large
picture
hanging
to
the
right
of
the
door
he
leant
forward
in
order
to
see
it
better
it
depicted
a
man
wearing
a
robes
he
was
sitting
on
a
lofty
throne
gilded
in
a
way
that
shone
forth
from
the
picture
the
odd
thing
about
the
picture
was
that
this
judge
was
not
sitting
there
in
dignified
calm
but
had
his
left
arm
pressed
against
the
back
and
armrest
his
right
arm
however
was
completely
free
and
only
grasped
the
armrest
with
his
hand
as
if
about
to
jump
up
any
moment
in
vigorous
outrage
and
make
some
decisive
comment
or
even
to
pass
sentence
the
accused
was
probably
meant
to
be
imagined
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
the
top
one
of
which
could
be
seen
in
the
picture
covered
with
a
yellow
carpet
that
might
be
my
judge
said
pointing
to
the
picture
with
one
finger
i
know
him
said
leni
looking
up
at
the
picture
he
comes
here
quite
often
that
picture
is
from
when
he
was
young
but
he
can
never
have
looked
anything
like
it
as
he
tiny
minute
almost
but
despite
that
he
had
himself
made
to
look
bigger
in
the
picture
as
he
madly
vain
just
like
everyone
round
here
but
even
i
vain
and
that
makes
me
very
unhappy
that
you
like
me
replied
to
that
last
comment
merely
by
embracing
leni
and
drawing
her
towards
him
she
lay
her
head
quietly
on
his
shoulder
to
the
rest
of
it
though
he
said
what
rank
is
he
he
an
examining
judge
she
said
taking
hold
of
the
hand
with
which
held
her
and
playing
with
his
fingers
just
an
examining
judge
once
again
said
in
disappointment
the
senior
officials
keep
themselves
hidden
but
here
he
is
sitting
on
a
throne
that
all
just
made
up
said
leni
with
her
face
bent
over
hand
really
he
sitting
on
a
kitchen
chair
with
an
old
horse
blanket
folded
over
it
but
do
you
have
to
be
always
thinking
about
your
trial
she
added
slowly
no
not
at
all
said
i
probably
even
think
too
little
about
it
that
not
the
mistake
you
making
said
leni
you
too
unyielding
that
what
i
heard
who
said
that
asked
he
felt
her
body
against
his
chest
and
looked
down
on
her
rich
dark
hair
i
be
saying
too
much
if
i
told
you
that
answered
leni
please
do
ask
for
names
but
do
stop
making
these
mistakes
of
yours
stop
being
so
unyielding
there
nothing
you
can
do
to
defend
yourself
from
this
court
you
have
to
confess
so
confess
to
them
as
soon
as
you
get
the
chance
it
only
then
that
they
give
you
the
chance
to
get
away
not
till
then
only
without
help
from
outside
even
that
impossible
but
you
need
worry
about
getting
this
help
as
i
want
to
help
you
myself
you
understand
a
lot
about
this
court
and
what
sort
of
tricks
are
needed
said
as
he
lifted
her
since
she
was
pressing
in
much
too
close
to
him
onto
his
lap
that
alright
then
she
said
and
made
herself
comfortable
on
his
lap
by
smoothing
out
her
skirt
and
adjusting
her
blouse
then
she
hung
both
her
arms
around
his
neck
leant
back
and
took
a
long
look
at
him
and
what
if
i
do
confess
could
you
not
help
me
then
asked
to
test
her
out
i
accumulating
women
to
help
me
he
thought
to
himself
almost
in
amazement
first
miss
b√ºrstner
then
the
court
usher
wife
and
now
this
little
care
assistant
who
seems
to
have
some
incomprehensible
need
for
me
the
way
she
sits
on
my
lap
as
if
it
were
her
proper
place
no
answered
leni
slowly
shaking
her
head
i
could
help
you
then
but
you
do
want
my
help
anyway
it
means
nothing
to
you
you
too
stubborn
and
wo
be
persuaded
then
after
a
while
she
asked
do
you
have
a
lover
no
said
oh
you
must
have
she
said
well
i
have
really
said
just
think
i
even
betrayed
her
while
i
carrying
her
photograph
with
me
leni
insisted
he
show
her
a
photograph
of
elsa
and
then
hunched
on
his
lap
studied
the
picture
closely
the
photograph
was
not
one
that
had
been
taken
while
elsa
was
posing
for
it
it
showed
her
just
after
she
had
been
in
a
wild
dance
such
as
she
liked
to
do
in
wine
bars
her
skirt
was
still
flung
out
as
she
span
round
she
had
placed
her
hands
on
her
firm
hips
and
with
her
neck
held
taut
looked
to
one
side
with
a
laugh
you
could
not
see
from
the
picture
whom
her
laugh
was
intended
for
she
very
tightly
laced
said
leni
pointing
to
the
place
where
she
thought
this
could
be
seen
i
do
like
her
clumsy
and
crude
but
maybe
she
gentle
and
friendly
towards
you
that
the
impression
you
get
from
the
picture
big
strong
girls
like
that
often
do
know
how
to
be
anything
but
gentle
and
friendly
would
she
be
capable
of
sacrificing
herself
for
you
though
no
said
she
is
gentle
or
friendly
and
nor
would
she
be
capable
of
sacrificing
herself
for
me
but
i
never
yet
asked
any
of
those
things
of
her
i
never
looked
at
this
picture
as
closely
as
you
you
ca
think
much
of
her
then
said
leni
she
ca
be
your
lover
after
all
yes
she
is
said
i
not
going
to
take
my
word
back
on
that
well
she
might
be
your
lover
now
then
said
leni
but
you
would
miss
her
much
if
you
lost
her
or
if
you
exchanged
her
for
somebody
else
me
for
instance
that
is
certainly
conceivable
said
with
a
smile
but
she
does
have
one
major
advantage
over
you
she
knows
nothing
about
my
trial
and
even
if
she
did
she
would
think
about
it
she
would
try
to
persuade
me
to
be
less
unyielding
well
that
no
advantage
said
leni
if
she
got
no
advantage
other
than
that
i
can
keep
on
hoping
has
she
got
any
bodily
defects
defects
asked
yeah
said
leni
as
i
do
have
a
bodily
defect
just
a
little
one
look
she
spread
the
middle
and
ring
fingers
of
her
right
hand
apart
from
each
other
between
those
fingers
the
flap
of
skin
connecting
them
reached
up
almost
as
far
as
the
top
joint
of
the
little
finger
in
the
darkness
did
not
see
at
first
what
it
was
she
wanted
to
show
him
so
she
led
his
hand
to
it
so
that
he
could
feel
what
a
freak
of
nature
said
and
when
he
had
taken
a
look
at
the
whole
hand
he
added
what
a
pretty
claw
leni
looked
on
with
a
kind
of
pride
as
repeatedly
opened
and
closed
her
two
fingers
in
amazement
until
finally
he
briefly
kissed
them
and
let
go
oh
she
immediately
exclaimed
you
kissed
me
hurriedly
and
with
her
mouth
open
she
clambered
up
lap
with
her
knees
he
was
almost
aghast
as
he
looked
up
at
her
now
that
she
was
so
close
to
him
there
was
a
bitter
irritating
smell
from
her
like
pepper
she
grasped
his
head
leant
out
over
him
and
bit
and
kissed
his
neck
even
biting
into
his
hair
i
taken
her
place
she
exclaimed
from
time
to
time
just
look
now
you
taken
me
instead
of
her
just
then
her
knee
slipped
out
and
with
a
little
cry
she
nearly
fell
down
onto
the
carpet
tried
to
hold
her
by
putting
his
arms
around
her
and
was
pulled
down
with
her
now
you
mine
she
said
her
last
words
to
him
as
he
left
were
here
the
key
to
the
door
come
whenever
you
want
and
she
planted
an
undirected
kiss
on
his
back
when
he
stepped
out
the
front
door
there
was
a
light
rain
falling
he
was
about
to
go
to
the
middle
of
the
street
to
see
if
he
could
still
glimpse
leni
at
the
window
when
uncle
leapt
out
of
a
car
that
thinking
of
other
things
had
not
seen
waiting
outside
the
building
he
took
hold
of
by
both
arms
and
shoved
him
against
the
door
as
if
he
wanted
to
nail
him
to
it
young
man
he
shouted
how
could
you
do
a
thing
like
that
things
were
going
well
with
this
business
of
yours
now
you
caused
it
terrible
damage
you
slip
off
with
some
dirty
little
thing
who
moreover
is
obviously
the
lawyer
beloved
and
stay
away
for
hours
you
do
even
try
to
find
an
excuse
do
try
to
hide
anything
no
you
quite
open
about
it
you
run
off
with
her
and
stay
there
and
meanwhile
sitting
there
your
uncle
who
going
to
such
effort
for
you
the
lawyer
who
needs
to
be
won
over
to
your
side
and
above
all
the
office
director
a
very
important
gentleman
who
is
in
direct
command
of
your
affair
in
its
present
stage
we
wanted
to
discuss
how
best
to
help
you
i
had
to
handle
the
lawyer
very
carefully
he
had
to
handle
the
office
director
carefully
and
you
had
most
reason
of
all
to
at
least
give
me
some
support
instead
of
which
you
stay
away
eventually
we
keep
up
the
pretence
any
longer
but
these
are
polite
and
highly
capable
men
they
did
say
anything
about
it
so
as
to
spare
my
feelings
but
in
the
end
not
even
they
could
continue
to
force
themselves
and
as
they
could
speak
about
the
matter
in
hand
they
became
silent
we
sat
there
for
several
minutes
listening
to
see
whether
you
would
finally
come
back
all
in
vain
in
the
end
the
office
director
stood
up
as
he
had
stayed
far
longer
than
he
had
originally
intended
made
his
farewell
looked
at
me
in
sympathy
without
being
able
to
help
he
waited
at
the
door
for
a
long
time
although
it
more
than
i
can
understand
why
he
was
being
so
good
and
then
he
went
i
of
course
was
glad
gone
i
been
holding
my
breath
all
this
time
all
this
had
even
more
affect
on
the
lawyer
lying
there
ill
when
i
took
my
leave
of
him
the
good
man
he
was
quite
unable
to
speak
you
have
probably
contributed
to
his
total
collapse
and
so
brought
the
very
man
who
you
are
dependent
on
closer
to
his
death
and
me
your
own
uncle
you
leave
me
here
in
the
rain
just
feel
this
i
wet
right
through
waiting
here
for
hours
sick
with
worry
chapter
seven
lawyer
manufacturer
painter
one
winter
morning
snow
was
falling
in
the
dull
light
outside
was
sitting
in
his
office
already
extremely
tired
despite
the
early
hour
he
had
told
the
servitor
he
was
engaged
in
a
major
piece
of
work
and
none
of
the
junior
staff
should
be
allowed
in
to
see
him
so
he
would
not
be
disturbed
by
them
at
least
but
instead
of
working
he
turned
round
in
his
chair
slowly
moved
various
items
around
his
desk
but
then
without
being
aware
of
it
he
lay
his
arm
stretched
out
on
the
desk
top
and
sat
there
immobile
with
his
head
sunk
down
on
his
chest
he
was
no
longer
able
to
get
the
thought
of
the
trial
out
of
his
head
he
had
often
wondered
whether
it
might
not
be
a
good
idea
to
work
out
a
written
defence
and
hand
it
in
to
the
court
it
would
contain
a
short
description
of
his
life
and
explain
why
he
had
acted
the
way
he
had
at
each
event
that
was
in
any
way
important
whether
he
now
considered
he
had
acted
well
or
ill
and
his
reasons
for
each
there
was
no
doubt
of
the
advantages
a
written
defence
of
this
sort
would
have
over
relying
on
the
lawyer
who
was
anyway
not
without
his
shortcomings
had
no
idea
what
actions
the
lawyer
was
taking
it
was
certainly
not
a
lot
it
was
more
than
a
month
since
the
lawyer
had
summoned
him
and
none
of
the
previous
discussions
had
given
the
impression
that
this
man
would
be
able
to
do
much
for
him
most
importantly
he
had
asked
him
hardly
any
questions
and
there
were
so
many
questions
here
to
be
asked
asking
questions
were
the
most
important
thing
had
the
feeling
that
he
would
be
able
to
ask
all
the
questions
needed
here
himself
the
lawyer
in
contrast
did
not
ask
questions
but
did
all
the
talking
himself
or
sat
silently
facing
him
leant
forward
slightly
over
the
desk
probably
because
he
was
hard
of
hearing
pulled
on
a
strand
of
hair
in
the
middle
of
his
beard
and
looked
down
at
the
carpet
perhaps
at
the
very
spot
where
had
lain
with
leni
now
and
then
he
would
give
some
vague
warning
of
the
sort
you
give
to
children
his
speeches
were
as
pointless
as
they
were
boring
and
decided
that
when
the
final
bill
came
he
would
pay
not
a
penny
for
them
once
the
lawyer
thought
he
had
humiliated
sufficiently
he
usually
started
something
that
would
raise
his
spirits
again
he
had
already
he
would
then
say
won
many
such
cases
partly
or
in
whole
cases
which
may
not
really
have
been
as
difficult
as
this
one
but
which
on
the
face
of
it
had
even
less
hope
of
success
he
had
a
list
of
these
cases
here
in
the
drawer
here
he
would
tap
on
one
or
other
of
the
drawers
in
his
desk
but
could
unfortunately
not
show
them
to
as
they
dealt
with
official
secrets
nonetheless
the
great
experience
he
had
acquired
through
all
these
cases
would
of
course
be
of
benefit
to
he
had
of
course
begun
work
straight
away
and
was
nearly
ready
to
submit
the
first
documents
they
would
be
very
important
because
the
first
impression
made
by
the
defence
will
often
determine
the
whole
course
of
the
proceedings
unfortunately
though
he
would
still
have
to
make
it
clear
to
that
the
first
documents
submitted
are
sometimes
not
even
read
by
the
court
they
simply
put
them
with
the
other
documents
and
point
out
that
for
the
time
being
questioning
and
observing
the
accused
are
much
more
important
than
anything
written
if
the
applicant
becomes
insistent
then
they
add
that
before
they
come
to
any
decision
as
soon
as
all
the
material
has
been
brought
together
with
due
regard
of
course
to
all
the
documents
then
these
first
documents
to
have
been
submitted
will
also
be
checked
over
but
unfortunately
even
this
is
not
usually
true
the
first
documents
submitted
are
usually
mislaid
or
lost
completely
and
even
if
they
do
keep
them
right
to
the
end
they
are
hardly
read
although
the
lawyer
only
knew
about
this
from
rumour
this
is
all
very
regrettable
but
not
entirely
without
its
justifications
but
should
not
forget
that
the
trial
would
not
be
public
if
the
court
deems
it
necessary
it
can
be
made
public
but
there
is
no
law
that
says
it
has
to
be
as
a
result
the
accused
and
his
defence
do
have
access
even
to
the
court
records
and
especially
not
to
the
indictment
and
that
means
we
generally
do
know
or
at
least
not
precisely
what
the
first
documents
need
to
be
about
which
means
that
if
they
do
contain
anything
of
relevance
to
the
case
it
only
by
a
lucky
coincidence
if
anything
about
the
individual
charges
and
the
reasons
for
them
comes
out
clearly
or
can
be
guessed
at
while
the
accused
is
being
questioned
then
it
possible
to
work
out
and
submit
documents
that
really
direct
the
issue
and
present
proof
but
not
before
conditions
like
this
of
course
place
the
defence
in
a
very
unfavourable
and
difficult
position
but
that
is
what
they
intend
in
fact
defence
is
not
really
allowed
under
the
law
it
only
tolerated
and
there
is
even
some
dispute
about
whether
the
relevant
parts
of
the
law
imply
even
that
so
strictly
speaking
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
counsel
acknowledged
by
the
court
and
anyone
who
comes
before
this
court
as
counsel
is
basically
no
more
than
a
barrack
room
lawyer
the
effect
of
all
this
of
course
is
to
remove
the
dignity
of
the
whole
procedure
the
next
time
is
in
the
court
offices
he
might
like
to
have
a
look
in
at
the
lawyers
room
just
so
that
he
seen
it
he
might
well
be
quite
shocked
by
the
people
he
sees
assembled
there
the
room
they
been
allocated
with
its
narrow
space
and
low
ceiling
will
be
enough
to
show
what
contempt
the
court
has
for
these
people
the
only
light
in
the
room
comes
through
a
little
window
that
is
so
high
up
that
if
you
want
to
look
out
of
it
you
first
have
to
get
one
of
your
colleagues
to
support
you
on
his
back
and
even
then
the
smoke
from
the
chimney
just
in
front
of
it
will
go
up
your
nose
and
make
your
face
black
in
the
floor
of
this
room
to
give
yet
another
example
of
the
conditions
there
there
is
a
hole
that
been
there
for
more
than
a
year
it
not
so
big
that
a
man
could
fall
through
but
it
is
big
enough
for
your
foot
to
disappear
through
it
the
lawyers
room
is
on
the
second
floor
of
the
attic
if
your
foot
does
go
through
it
will
hang
down
into
the
first
floor
of
the
attic
underneath
it
and
right
in
the
corridor
where
the
litigants
are
waiting
it
no
exaggeration
when
lawyers
say
that
conditions
like
that
are
a
disgrace
complaints
to
the
management
do
have
the
slightest
effect
but
the
lawyers
are
strictly
forbidden
to
alter
anything
in
the
room
at
their
own
expense
but
even
treating
the
lawyers
in
this
way
has
its
reasons
they
want
as
far
as
possible
to
prevent
any
kind
of
defence
everything
should
be
made
the
responsibility
of
the
accused
not
a
bad
point
of
view
basically
but
nothing
could
be
more
mistaken
than
to
think
from
that
that
lawyers
are
not
necessary
for
the
accused
in
this
court
on
the
contrary
there
is
no
court
where
they
are
less
needed
than
here
this
is
because
proceedings
are
generally
kept
secret
not
only
from
the
public
but
also
from
the
accused
only
as
far
as
that
is
possible
of
course
but
it
is
possible
to
a
very
large
extent
and
the
accused
does
get
to
see
the
court
records
either
and
it
very
difficult
to
infer
what
in
the
court
records
from
what
been
said
during
questioning
based
on
them
especially
for
the
accused
who
is
in
a
difficult
situation
and
is
faced
with
every
possible
worry
to
distract
him
this
is
when
the
defence
begins
counsel
for
the
defence
are
not
normally
allowed
to
be
present
while
the
accused
is
being
questioned
so
afterwards
and
if
possible
still
at
the
door
of
the
interview
room
he
has
to
learn
what
he
can
about
it
from
him
and
extract
whatever
he
can
that
might
be
of
use
even
though
what
the
accused
has
to
report
is
often
very
confused
but
that
is
not
the
most
important
thing
as
there
really
not
a
lot
that
can
be
learned
in
this
way
although
in
this
as
with
anything
else
a
competent
man
will
learn
more
than
another
nonetheless
the
most
important
thing
is
the
lawyer
personal
connections
that
where
the
real
value
of
taking
counsel
lies
now
will
most
likely
have
already
learned
from
his
own
experience
that
among
its
very
lowest
orders
the
court
organisation
does
have
its
imperfections
the
court
is
strictly
closed
to
the
public
but
staff
who
forget
their
duty
or
who
take
bribes
do
to
some
extent
show
where
the
gaps
are
this
is
where
most
lawyers
will
push
their
way
in
this
is
where
bribes
are
paid
and
information
extracted
there
have
even
in
earlier
times
at
least
been
incidents
where
documents
have
been
stolen
there
no
denying
that
some
surprisingly
favourable
results
have
been
attained
for
the
accused
in
this
way
for
a
limited
time
and
these
petty
advocates
then
strut
to
and
fro
on
the
basis
of
them
and
attract
new
clients
but
for
the
further
course
of
the
proceedings
it
signifies
either
nothing
or
nothing
good
the
only
things
of
real
value
are
honest
personal
contacts
contacts
with
higher
officials
albeit
higher
officials
of
the
lower
grades
you
understand
that
is
the
only
way
the
progress
of
the
trial
can
be
influenced
hardly
noticeable
at
first
it
true
but
from
then
on
it
becomes
more
and
more
visible
there
are
of
course
not
many
lawyers
who
can
do
this
and
has
made
a
very
good
choice
in
this
matter
there
were
probably
no
more
than
one
or
two
who
had
as
many
contacts
as
huld
but
they
do
bother
with
the
company
of
the
lawyers
room
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
this
means
they
have
all
the
less
contact
with
the
court
officials
it
is
not
at
all
necessary
for
huld
to
go
to
the
court
wait
in
the
for
the
examining
judges
to
turn
up
if
they
turn
up
and
try
to
achieve
something
which
according
to
the
judges
mood
is
usually
more
apparent
than
real
and
most
often
not
even
that
no
has
seen
for
himself
that
the
court
officials
including
some
who
are
quite
high
up
come
forward
without
being
asked
are
glad
to
give
information
which
is
fully
open
or
at
least
easy
to
understand
they
discuss
the
next
stages
in
the
proceedings
in
fact
in
some
cases
they
can
be
won
over
and
are
quite
willing
to
adopt
the
other
person
point
of
view
however
when
this
happens
you
should
never
trust
them
too
far
as
however
firmly
they
may
have
declared
this
new
point
of
view
in
favour
of
the
defendant
they
might
well
go
straight
back
to
their
offices
and
write
a
report
for
the
court
that
says
just
the
opposite
and
might
well
be
even
harder
on
the
defendant
than
the
original
view
the
one
they
insist
they
been
fully
dissuaded
from
and
of
course
there
no
way
of
defending
yourself
from
this
something
said
in
private
is
indeed
in
private
and
can
not
then
be
used
in
public
it
not
something
that
makes
it
easy
for
the
defence
to
keep
those
gentlemen
favour
on
the
other
hand
it
also
true
that
the
gentlemen
do
become
involved
with
the
defence
which
will
of
course
be
done
with
great
expertise
just
for
philanthropic
reasons
or
in
order
to
be
friendly
in
some
respects
it
would
be
truer
to
say
that
they
too
have
it
allocated
to
them
this
is
where
the
disadvantages
of
a
court
structure
that
right
from
the
start
stipulates
that
all
proceedings
take
place
in
private
come
into
force
in
normal
mediocre
trials
its
officials
have
contact
with
the
public
and
they
very
well
equipped
for
it
but
here
they
do
normal
trials
run
their
course
all
by
themselves
almost
and
just
need
a
nudge
here
and
there
but
when
they
faced
with
cases
that
are
especially
difficult
they
as
lost
as
they
often
are
with
ones
that
are
very
simple
they
forced
to
spend
all
their
time
day
and
night
with
their
laws
and
so
they
do
have
the
right
feel
for
human
relationships
and
that
a
serious
shortcoming
in
cases
like
this
that
when
they
come
for
advice
to
the
lawyer
with
a
servant
behind
them
carrying
the
documents
which
normally
are
kept
so
secret
you
could
have
seen
many
gentlemen
at
this
window
gentlemen
of
whom
you
would
least
expect
it
staring
out
this
window
in
despair
on
the
street
below
while
the
lawyer
is
at
his
desk
studying
the
documents
so
that
he
can
give
them
good
advice
and
at
times
like
that
it
also
possible
to
see
how
exceptionally
seriously
these
gentlemen
take
their
professions
and
how
they
are
thrown
into
great
confusion
by
difficulties
which
just
not
in
their
natures
to
overcome
but
they
not
in
an
easy
position
to
regard
their
positions
as
easy
would
be
to
do
them
an
injustice
the
different
ranks
and
hierarchies
of
the
court
are
endless
and
even
someone
who
knows
his
way
around
them
can
not
always
tell
what
going
to
happen
but
even
for
the
junior
officials
the
proceedings
in
the
courtrooms
are
usually
kept
secret
so
they
are
hardly
able
to
see
how
the
cases
they
work
with
proceed
court
affairs
appear
in
their
range
of
vision
often
without
their
knowing
where
they
come
from
and
they
move
on
further
without
their
learning
where
they
go
so
civil
servants
like
this
are
not
able
to
learn
the
things
you
can
learn
from
studying
the
successive
stages
that
individual
trials
go
through
the
final
verdict
or
the
reasons
for
it
they
only
allowed
to
deal
with
that
part
of
the
trial
which
the
law
allocates
them
and
they
usually
know
less
about
the
results
of
their
work
after
it
left
them
than
the
defence
does
even
though
the
defence
will
usually
stay
in
contact
with
the
accused
until
the
trial
is
nearly
at
its
end
so
that
the
court
officials
can
learn
many
useful
things
from
the
defence
bearing
all
this
in
mind
does
it
still
surprise
that
the
officials
are
irritated
and
often
express
themselves
about
the
litigants
in
unflattering
ways
which
is
an
experience
shared
by
everyone
all
the
officials
are
irritated
even
when
they
appear
calm
this
causes
many
difficulties
for
the
junior
advocates
of
course
there
is
a
story
for
instance
that
has
very
much
the
ring
of
truth
about
it
it
goes
like
this
one
of
the
older
officials
a
good
and
peaceful
man
was
dealing
with
a
difficult
matter
for
the
court
which
had
become
very
confused
especially
thanks
to
the
contributions
from
the
lawyers
he
had
been
studying
it
for
a
day
and
a
night
without
a
break
as
these
officials
are
indeed
hard
working
works
as
hard
as
they
do
when
it
was
nearly
morning
and
he
had
been
working
for
hours
with
probably
very
little
result
he
went
to
the
front
entrance
waited
there
in
ambush
and
every
time
a
lawyer
tried
to
enter
the
building
he
would
throw
him
down
the
steps
the
lawyers
gathered
together
down
in
front
of
the
steps
and
discussed
with
each
other
what
they
should
do
on
the
one
hand
they
had
actually
no
right
to
be
allowed
into
the
building
so
that
there
was
hardly
anything
that
they
could
legally
do
to
the
official
and
as
i
already
mentioned
they
would
have
to
be
careful
not
to
set
all
the
officials
against
them
on
the
other
hand
any
day
not
spent
in
court
is
a
day
lost
for
them
and
it
was
a
matter
of
some
importance
to
force
their
way
inside
in
the
end
they
agreed
that
they
would
try
to
tire
the
old
man
out
one
lawyer
after
another
was
sent
out
to
run
up
the
steps
and
let
himself
be
thrown
down
again
offering
what
resistance
he
could
as
long
as
it
was
passive
resistance
and
his
colleagues
would
catch
him
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
that
went
on
for
about
an
hour
until
the
old
gentleman
who
was
already
exhausted
from
working
all
night
was
very
tired
and
went
back
to
his
office
those
who
were
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
could
not
believe
it
at
first
so
they
sent
somebody
out
to
go
and
look
behind
the
door
to
see
if
there
really
was
there
and
only
then
did
they
all
gather
together
and
probably
did
even
dare
to
complain
as
it
far
from
being
the
lawyers
job
to
introduce
any
improvements
in
the
court
system
or
even
to
want
to
even
the
most
junior
lawyer
can
understand
the
relationship
there
to
some
extent
but
one
significant
point
is
that
almost
every
defendant
even
very
simple
people
begins
to
think
of
suggestions
for
improving
the
court
as
soon
as
his
proceedings
have
begun
many
of
them
often
even
spend
time
and
energy
on
the
matter
that
could
be
spent
far
better
elsewhere
the
only
right
thing
to
do
is
to
learn
how
to
deal
with
the
situation
as
it
is
even
if
it
were
possible
to
improve
any
detail
of
it
which
is
anyway
no
more
than
superstitious
nonsense
the
best
that
they
could
achieve
although
doing
themselves
incalculable
harm
in
the
process
is
that
they
will
have
attracted
the
special
attention
of
the
officials
for
any
case
that
comes
up
in
the
future
and
the
officials
are
always
ready
to
seek
revenge
never
attract
attention
to
yourself
stay
calm
however
much
it
goes
against
your
character
try
to
gain
some
insight
into
the
size
of
the
court
organism
and
how
to
some
extent
it
remains
in
a
state
of
suspension
and
that
even
if
you
alter
something
in
one
place
you
draw
the
ground
out
from
under
your
feet
and
might
fall
whereas
if
an
enormous
organism
like
the
court
is
disrupted
in
any
one
place
it
finds
it
easy
to
provide
a
substitute
for
itself
somewhere
else
everything
is
connected
with
everything
else
and
will
continue
without
any
change
or
else
which
is
quite
probable
even
more
closed
more
attentive
more
strict
more
malevolent
so
it
best
to
leave
the
work
to
the
lawyers
and
not
to
keep
disturbing
them
it
does
do
much
good
to
make
accusations
especially
if
you
ca
make
it
clear
what
they
based
on
and
their
full
significance
but
it
must
be
said
that
caused
a
great
deal
of
harm
to
his
own
case
by
his
behaviour
towards
the
office
director
he
was
a
very
influential
man
but
now
he
might
as
well
be
struck
off
the
list
of
those
who
might
do
anything
for
if
the
trial
is
mentioned
even
just
in
passing
quite
obvious
that
he
ignoring
it
these
officials
are
in
many
ways
just
like
children
often
something
quite
harmless
although
behaviour
could
unfortunately
not
be
called
harmless
will
leave
them
feeling
so
offended
that
they
will
even
stop
talking
with
good
friends
of
theirs
they
turn
away
when
they
see
them
and
do
everything
they
can
to
oppose
them
but
then
with
no
particular
reason
surprisingly
enough
some
little
joke
that
was
only
ever
attempted
because
everything
seemed
so
hopeless
will
make
them
laugh
and
they
be
reconciled
it
both
difficult
and
hard
at
the
same
time
to
deal
with
them
and
there
hardly
any
reason
for
it
it
sometimes
quite
astonishing
that
a
single
average
life
is
enough
to
encompass
so
much
that
it
at
all
possible
ever
to
have
any
success
in
one
work
here
on
the
other
hand
there
are
also
dark
moments
such
as
everyone
has
when
you
think
you
achieved
nothing
at
all
when
it
seems
that
the
only
trials
to
come
to
a
good
end
are
those
that
were
determined
to
have
a
good
end
from
the
start
and
would
do
so
without
any
help
while
all
the
others
are
lost
despite
all
the
running
to
and
fro
all
the
effort
all
the
little
apparent
successes
that
gave
such
joy
then
you
no
longer
feel
very
sure
of
anything
and
if
asked
about
a
trial
that
was
doing
well
by
its
own
nature
but
which
was
turned
for
the
worse
because
you
assisted
in
it
would
not
even
dare
deny
that
and
even
that
is
a
kind
of
confidence
but
then
it
the
only
one
that
left
lawyers
are
especially
vulnerable
to
fits
of
depression
of
that
sort
and
they
are
no
more
than
fits
of
depression
of
course
when
a
case
is
suddenly
taken
out
of
their
hands
after
they
been
conducting
it
satisfactorily
for
some
time
that
probably
the
worst
that
can
happen
to
a
lawyer
it
not
that
the
accused
takes
the
case
away
from
him
that
hardly
ever
happens
once
a
defendant
has
taken
on
a
certain
lawyer
he
has
to
stay
with
him
whatever
happens
how
could
he
ever
carry
on
by
himself
after
he
taken
on
help
from
a
lawyer
no
that
just
does
happen
but
what
does
sometimes
happen
is
that
the
trial
takes
on
a
course
where
the
lawyer
may
not
go
along
with
it
client
and
trial
are
both
simply
taken
away
from
the
lawyer
and
then
even
contact
with
the
court
officials
wo
help
however
good
they
are
as
they
do
know
anything
themselves
the
trial
will
have
entered
a
stage
where
no
more
help
can
be
given
where
it
being
processed
in
courts
to
which
has
any
access
where
the
defendant
can
not
even
be
contacted
by
his
lawyer
you
come
home
one
day
and
find
all
the
documents
you
submitted
which
you
worked
hard
to
create
and
which
you
had
the
best
hopes
for
lying
on
the
desk
they
been
sent
back
as
they
ca
be
carried
through
to
the
next
stage
in
the
trial
they
just
worthless
scraps
of
paper
it
does
mean
that
the
case
has
been
lost
not
at
all
or
at
least
there
is
no
decisive
reason
for
supposing
so
it
just
that
you
do
know
anything
more
about
the
case
and
wo
be
told
anything
of
happening
well
cases
like
that
are
the
exceptions
i
glad
to
say
and
even
if
trial
is
one
of
them
it
still
for
the
time
being
a
long
way
off
but
there
was
still
plenty
of
opportunity
for
lawyers
to
get
to
work
and
could
be
sure
they
would
be
made
use
of
as
he
had
said
the
time
for
submitting
documents
was
still
in
the
future
and
there
was
no
rush
to
prepare
them
it
was
much
more
important
to
start
the
initial
discussions
with
the
appropriate
officials
and
they
had
already
taken
place
with
varying
degrees
of
success
it
must
be
said
it
was
much
better
not
to
give
away
any
details
before
their
time
as
in
that
way
could
only
be
influenced
unfavourably
and
his
hopes
might
be
raised
or
he
might
be
made
too
anxious
better
just
to
say
that
some
individuals
have
spoken
very
favourably
and
shown
themselves
very
willing
to
help
although
others
have
spoken
less
favourably
but
even
they
have
not
in
any
way
refused
to
help
so
all
in
all
the
results
are
very
encouraging
only
you
should
certainly
not
draw
any
particular
conclusions
as
all
preliminary
proceedings
begin
in
the
same
way
and
it
was
only
the
way
they
developed
further
that
would
show
what
the
value
of
these
preliminary
proceedings
has
been
anyway
nothing
has
been
lost
yet
and
if
we
can
succeed
in
getting
the
office
director
despite
everything
on
our
side
and
several
actions
have
been
undertaken
to
this
end
then
everything
is
a
clean
wound
as
a
surgeon
would
say
and
we
can
wait
for
the
results
with
some
comfort
when
he
started
talking
on
in
this
way
the
lawyer
was
quite
tireless
he
went
through
it
all
again
every
time
went
to
see
him
there
was
always
some
progress
but
he
could
never
be
told
what
sort
of
progress
it
was
the
first
set
of
documents
to
be
submitted
were
being
worked
on
but
still
not
ready
which
usually
turned
out
to
be
a
great
advantage
the
next
time
went
to
see
him
as
the
earlier
occasion
would
have
been
a
very
bad
time
to
put
them
in
which
they
could
not
then
have
known
if
stupefied
from
all
this
talking
ever
pointed
out
that
even
considering
all
these
difficulties
progress
was
very
slow
the
lawyer
would
object
that
progress
was
not
slow
at
all
but
that
they
might
have
progressed
far
further
if
had
come
to
him
at
the
right
time
but
he
had
come
to
him
late
and
that
lateness
would
bring
still
further
difficulties
and
not
only
where
time
was
concerned
the
only
welcome
interruption
during
these
visits
was
always
when
leni
contrived
to
bring
the
lawyer
his
tea
while
was
there
then
she
would
stand
behind
pretending
to
watch
the
lawyer
as
he
bent
greedily
over
his
cup
poured
the
tea
in
and
drank
and
secretly
let
hold
her
hand
there
was
always
complete
silence
the
lawyer
drank
squeezed
leni
hand
and
leni
would
sometimes
dare
to
gently
stroke
hair
still
here
are
you
the
lawyer
would
ask
when
he
was
ready
i
wanted
to
take
the
dishes
away
said
leni
they
would
give
each
hands
a
final
squeeze
the
lawyer
would
wipe
his
mouth
and
then
start
talking
at
again
with
renewed
energy
was
the
lawyer
trying
to
comfort
or
to
confuse
him
could
not
tell
but
it
seemed
clear
to
him
that
his
defence
was
not
in
good
hands
maybe
everything
the
lawyer
said
was
quite
right
even
though
he
obviously
wanted
to
make
himself
as
conspicuous
as
possible
and
probably
had
never
even
taken
on
a
case
as
important
as
he
said
was
but
it
was
still
suspicious
how
he
continually
mentioned
his
personal
contacts
with
the
civil
servants
were
they
to
be
exploited
solely
for
benefit
the
lawyer
never
forgot
to
mention
that
they
were
dealing
only
with
junior
officials
which
meant
officials
who
were
dependent
on
others
and
the
direction
taken
in
each
trial
could
be
important
for
their
own
furtherment
could
it
be
that
they
were
making
use
of
the
lawyer
to
turn
trials
in
a
certain
direction
which
would
of
course
always
be
at
the
cost
of
the
defendant
it
certainly
did
not
mean
that
they
would
do
that
in
every
trial
that
was
not
likely
at
all
and
there
were
probably
also
trials
where
they
gave
the
lawyer
advantages
and
all
the
room
he
needed
to
turn
it
in
the
direction
he
wanted
as
it
would
also
be
to
their
advantage
to
keep
his
reputation
intact
if
that
really
was
their
relationship
how
would
they
direct
trial
which
as
the
lawyer
had
explained
was
especially
difficult
and
therefore
important
enough
to
attract
great
attention
from
the
very
first
time
it
came
to
court
there
could
not
be
much
doubt
about
what
they
would
do
the
first
signs
of
it
could
already
be
seen
in
the
fact
that
the
first
documents
still
had
not
been
submitted
even
though
the
trial
had
already
lasted
several
months
and
that
according
to
the
lawyer
everything
was
still
in
its
initial
stages
which
was
very
effective
of
course
in
making
the
defendant
passive
and
keeping
him
helpless
then
he
could
be
suddenly
surprised
with
the
verdict
or
at
least
with
a
notification
that
the
hearing
had
not
decided
in
his
favour
and
the
matter
would
be
passed
on
to
a
higher
office
it
was
essential
that
take
a
hand
in
it
himself
on
mornings
such
as
this
when
he
was
very
tired
and
everything
dragged
itself
lethargically
through
his
head
this
belief
of
his
seemed
irrefutable
he
no
longer
felt
the
contempt
for
the
trial
that
he
had
had
earlier
if
he
had
been
alone
in
the
world
it
would
have
been
easy
for
him
to
ignore
it
although
it
was
also
certain
that
in
that
case
the
trial
would
never
have
arisen
in
the
first
place
but
now
his
uncle
had
already
dragged
him
to
see
the
lawyer
he
had
to
take
account
of
his
family
his
job
was
no
longer
totally
separate
from
the
progress
of
the
trial
he
himself
had
carelessly
with
a
certain
inexplicable
complacency
mentioned
it
to
acquaintances
and
others
had
learned
about
it
in
ways
he
did
not
know
his
relationship
with
miss
b√ºrstner
seemed
to
be
in
trouble
because
of
it
in
short
he
no
longer
had
any
choice
whether
he
would
accept
the
trial
or
turn
it
down
he
was
in
the
middle
of
it
and
had
to
defend
himself
if
he
was
tired
then
that
was
bad
but
there
was
no
reason
to
worry
too
much
before
he
needed
to
he
had
been
capable
of
working
himself
up
to
his
high
position
in
the
bank
in
a
relatively
short
time
and
to
retain
it
with
respect
from
everyone
now
he
simply
had
to
apply
some
of
the
talents
that
had
made
that
possible
for
him
to
the
trial
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
it
had
to
turn
out
well
the
most
important
thing
if
something
was
to
be
achieved
was
to
reject
in
advance
any
idea
that
he
might
be
in
any
way
guilty
there
was
no
guilt
the
trial
was
nothing
but
a
big
piece
of
business
just
like
he
had
already
concluded
to
the
benefit
of
the
bank
many
times
a
piece
of
business
that
concealed
many
lurking
dangers
waiting
in
ambush
for
him
as
they
usually
did
and
these
dangers
would
need
to
be
defended
against
if
that
was
to
be
achieved
then
he
must
not
entertain
any
idea
of
guilt
whatever
he
did
he
would
need
to
look
after
his
own
interests
as
closely
as
he
could
seen
in
this
way
there
was
no
choice
but
to
take
his
representation
away
from
the
lawyer
very
soon
at
best
that
very
evening
the
lawyer
had
told
him
as
he
talked
to
him
that
that
was
something
unheard
of
and
would
probably
do
him
a
great
deal
of
harm
but
could
not
tolerate
any
impediment
to
his
efforts
where
his
trial
was
concerned
and
these
impediments
were
probably
caused
by
the
lawyer
himself
but
once
he
had
shaken
off
the
lawyer
the
documents
would
need
to
be
submitted
straight
away
and
if
possible
he
would
need
to
see
to
it
that
they
were
being
dealt
with
every
day
it
would
of
course
not
be
enough
if
that
was
to
be
done
for
to
sit
in
the
corridor
with
his
hat
under
the
bench
like
the
others
day
after
day
he
himself
or
one
of
the
women
or
somebody
else
on
his
behalf
would
have
to
run
after
the
officials
and
force
them
to
sit
at
their
desks
and
study
documents
instead
of
looking
out
on
the
corridor
through
the
grating
there
could
be
no
in
these
efforts
everything
would
need
to
be
organised
and
supervised
it
was
about
time
that
the
court
came
up
against
a
defendant
who
knew
how
to
defend
and
make
use
of
his
rights
but
when
had
the
confidence
to
try
and
do
all
this
the
difficulty
of
composing
the
documents
was
too
much
for
him
earlier
just
a
week
or
so
before
he
could
only
have
felt
shame
at
the
thought
of
being
made
to
write
out
such
documents
himself
it
had
never
entered
his
head
that
the
task
could
also
be
difficult
he
remembered
one
morning
when
already
piled
up
with
work
he
suddenly
shoved
everything
to
one
side
and
took
a
pad
of
paper
on
which
he
sketched
out
some
of
his
thoughts
on
how
documents
of
this
sort
should
proceed
perhaps
he
would
offer
them
to
that
lawyer
but
just
then
the
door
of
the
manager
office
opened
and
the
entered
the
room
with
a
loud
laugh
was
very
embarrassed
although
the
of
course
was
not
laughing
at
documents
which
he
knew
nothing
about
but
at
a
joke
he
had
just
heard
about
the
a
joke
which
needed
an
illustration
if
it
was
to
be
understood
and
now
the
director
leant
over
desk
took
his
pencil
from
his
hand
and
drew
the
illustration
on
the
writing
pad
that
had
intended
for
his
ideas
about
his
case
now
had
no
more
thoughts
of
shame
the
documents
had
to
be
prepared
and
submitted
if
as
was
very
likely
he
could
find
no
time
to
do
it
in
the
office
he
would
have
to
do
it
at
home
at
night
if
the
nights
were
enough
he
would
have
to
take
a
holiday
above
all
he
could
not
stop
half
way
that
was
nonsense
not
only
in
business
but
always
and
everywhere
needless
to
say
the
documents
would
mean
an
almost
endless
amount
of
work
it
was
easy
to
come
to
the
belief
not
only
for
those
of
an
anxious
disposition
that
it
was
impossible
ever
to
finish
it
this
was
not
because
of
laziness
or
deceit
which
were
the
only
things
that
might
have
hindered
the
lawyer
in
preparing
it
but
because
he
did
not
know
what
the
charge
was
or
even
what
consequences
it
might
bring
so
that
he
had
to
remember
every
tiny
action
and
event
from
the
whole
of
his
life
looking
at
them
from
all
sides
and
checking
and
reconsidering
them
it
was
also
a
very
disheartening
job
it
would
have
been
more
suitable
as
a
way
of
passing
the
long
days
after
he
had
retired
and
become
senile
but
now
just
when
needed
to
apply
all
his
thoughts
to
his
work
when
he
was
still
rising
and
already
posed
a
threat
to
the
when
every
hour
passed
so
quickly
and
he
wanted
to
enjoy
the
brief
evenings
and
nights
as
a
young
man
this
was
the
time
he
had
to
start
working
out
these
documents
once
more
he
began
to
feel
resentment
almost
involuntarily
only
to
put
an
end
to
it
his
finger
felt
for
the
button
of
the
electric
bell
in
the
as
he
pressed
it
he
glanced
up
to
the
clock
it
was
eleven
two
hours
he
had
spent
a
great
deal
of
his
costly
time
just
dreaming
and
his
wits
were
of
course
even
more
dulled
than
they
had
been
before
but
the
time
had
nonetheless
not
been
wasted
he
had
come
to
some
decisions
that
could
be
of
value
as
well
as
various
pieces
of
mail
the
servitors
brought
two
visiting
cards
from
gentlemen
who
had
already
been
waiting
for
for
some
time
they
were
actually
very
important
clients
of
the
bank
who
should
not
really
have
been
kept
waiting
under
any
circumstances
why
had
they
come
at
such
an
awkward
time
and
why
the
gentlemen
on
the
other
side
of
the
closed
door
seemed
to
be
asking
was
the
industrious
using
up
the
best
business
time
for
his
private
affairs
tired
from
what
had
gone
before
and
tired
in
anticipation
of
what
was
to
follow
stood
up
to
receive
the
first
of
them
he
was
a
short
jolly
man
a
manufacturer
who
knew
well
he
apologised
for
disturbing
at
some
important
work
and
for
his
part
apologised
for
having
kept
the
manufacturer
waiting
for
so
long
but
even
this
apology
was
spoken
in
such
a
mechanical
way
and
with
such
false
intonation
that
the
manufacturer
would
certainly
have
noticed
if
he
had
not
been
fully
preoccupied
with
his
business
affairs
instead
he
hurriedly
pulled
calculations
and
tables
out
from
all
his
pockets
spread
them
out
in
front
of
explained
several
items
corrected
a
little
mistake
in
the
arithmetic
that
he
noticed
as
he
quickly
glanced
over
it
all
and
reminded
of
a
similar
piece
of
business
concluded
with
him
about
a
year
before
mentioning
in
passing
that
this
time
there
was
another
bank
spending
great
effort
to
get
his
business
and
finally
stopped
speaking
in
order
to
learn
opinion
on
the
matter
and
had
indeed
at
first
been
closely
following
what
the
manufacturer
was
saying
he
too
was
aware
of
how
important
the
deal
was
but
unfortunately
it
did
not
last
he
soon
stopped
listening
nodded
at
each
of
the
manufacturer
louder
exclamations
for
a
short
while
but
eventually
he
stopped
doing
even
that
and
did
no
more
than
stare
at
the
bald
head
bent
over
the
papers
asking
himself
when
the
manufacturer
would
finally
realise
that
everything
he
was
saying
was
useless
when
he
did
stop
talking
really
thought
at
first
that
this
was
so
that
he
would
have
the
chance
to
confess
that
he
was
incapable
of
listening
instead
seeing
the
anticipation
on
the
manufacturer
face
obviously
ready
to
counter
any
objections
made
he
was
sorry
to
realise
that
the
business
discussion
had
to
be
continued
so
he
bent
his
head
as
if
been
given
an
order
and
began
slowly
to
move
his
pencil
over
the
papers
now
and
then
he
would
stop
and
stare
at
one
of
the
figures
the
manufacturer
thought
there
must
be
some
objection
perhaps
his
figures
were
really
sound
perhaps
they
were
the
decisive
issue
whatever
he
thought
the
manufacturer
covered
the
papers
with
his
hand
and
began
once
again
moving
very
close
to
to
explain
what
the
deal
was
all
about
it
is
difficult
said
pursing
his
lips
the
only
thing
that
could
offer
him
any
guidance
were
the
papers
and
the
manufacturer
had
covered
them
from
his
view
so
he
just
sank
back
against
the
arm
of
the
chair
even
when
the
door
of
the
manager
office
opened
and
revealed
not
very
clearly
as
if
through
a
veil
the
deputy
director
he
did
no
more
than
look
up
weakly
thought
no
more
about
the
matter
he
merely
watched
the
immediate
effect
of
the
deputy
appearance
and
for
him
the
effect
was
very
pleasing
the
manufacturer
immediately
jumped
up
from
his
seat
and
hurried
over
to
meet
the
deputy
director
although
would
have
liked
to
make
him
ten
times
livelier
as
he
feared
the
deputy
director
might
disappear
again
he
need
not
have
worried
the
two
gentlemen
met
each
other
shook
each
other
hand
and
went
together
over
to
desk
the
manufacturer
said
he
was
sorry
to
find
the
chief
clerk
so
little
inclined
to
do
business
pointing
to
who
under
the
view
of
the
deputy
director
had
bent
back
down
over
the
papers
as
the
two
men
leant
over
the
desk
and
the
manufacturer
made
some
effort
to
gain
and
keep
the
deputy
director
attention
felt
as
if
they
were
much
bigger
than
they
really
were
and
that
their
negotiations
were
about
him
carefully
and
slowly
turning
his
eyes
upwards
he
tried
to
learn
what
was
taking
place
above
him
took
one
of
the
papers
from
his
desk
without
looking
to
see
what
it
was
lay
it
on
the
flat
of
his
hand
and
raised
it
slowly
up
as
he
rose
up
to
the
level
of
the
two
men
himself
he
had
no
particular
plan
in
mind
as
he
did
this
but
merely
felt
this
was
how
he
would
act
if
only
he
had
finished
preparing
that
great
document
that
was
to
remove
his
burden
entirely
the
deputy
director
had
been
paying
all
his
attention
to
the
conversation
and
did
no
more
than
glance
at
the
paper
he
did
not
read
what
was
written
on
it
at
all
as
what
was
important
for
the
chief
clerk
was
not
important
for
him
he
took
it
from
hand
saying
thank
you
i
already
familiar
with
everything
and
lay
it
calmly
back
on
the
desk
gave
him
a
bitter
sideways
look
but
the
deputy
director
did
not
notice
this
at
all
or
if
he
did
notice
it
it
only
raised
his
spirits
he
frequently
laughed
out
loud
one
time
he
clearly
embarrassed
the
manufacturer
when
he
raised
an
objection
in
a
witty
way
but
drew
him
immediately
back
out
of
his
embarrassment
by
commenting
adversely
on
himself
and
finally
invited
him
into
his
office
where
they
could
bring
the
matter
to
its
conclusion
it
a
very
important
matter
said
the
manufacturer
i
understand
that
completely
and
i
sure
the
chief
clerk
even
as
he
said
this
he
was
actually
speaking
only
to
the
manufacturer
will
be
very
glad
to
have
us
take
it
off
his
hands
this
is
something
that
needs
calm
consideration
but
he
seems
to
be
today
there
are
even
some
people
in
the
room
outside
who
been
waiting
there
for
hours
for
him
still
had
enough
control
of
himself
to
turn
away
from
the
deputy
director
and
direct
his
friendly
albeit
stiff
smile
only
at
the
manufacturer
he
made
no
other
retaliation
bent
down
slightly
and
supported
himself
with
both
hands
on
his
desk
like
a
clerk
and
watched
as
the
two
gentlemen
still
talking
took
the
papers
from
his
desk
and
disappeared
into
the
manager
office
in
the
doorway
the
manufacturer
turned
and
said
he
would
make
his
farewell
with
just
yet
he
would
of
course
let
the
chief
clerk
know
about
the
success
of
his
discussions
but
he
also
had
a
little
something
to
tell
him
about
at
last
was
by
himself
it
did
not
enter
his
head
to
show
anyone
else
into
his
office
and
only
became
vaguely
aware
of
how
nice
it
was
that
the
people
outside
thought
he
was
still
negotiating
with
the
manufacturer
and
for
this
reason
he
could
not
let
anyone
in
to
see
him
not
even
the
servitor
he
went
over
to
the
window
sat
down
on
the
ledge
beside
it
held
firmly
on
to
the
handle
and
looked
down
onto
the
square
outside
the
snow
was
still
falling
the
weather
still
had
not
brightened
up
at
all
he
remained
a
long
time
sitting
in
this
way
not
knowing
what
it
actually
was
that
made
him
so
anxious
only
occasionally
did
he
glance
slightly
startled
over
his
shoulder
at
the
door
to
the
outer
room
where
mistakenly
he
thought
he
heard
some
noise
came
and
that
made
him
feel
calmer
he
went
over
to
the
wash
stand
rinsed
his
face
with
cold
water
and
his
head
somewhat
clearer
went
back
to
his
place
by
the
window
the
decision
to
take
his
defence
into
his
own
hands
now
seemed
more
of
a
burden
than
he
had
originally
assumed
all
the
while
he
had
left
his
defence
up
to
the
lawyer
his
trial
had
had
little
basic
affect
on
him
he
had
observed
it
from
afar
as
something
that
was
scarcely
able
to
reach
him
directly
when
it
suited
him
he
looked
to
see
how
things
stood
but
he
was
also
able
to
draw
his
head
back
again
whenever
he
wanted
now
in
contrast
if
he
was
to
conduct
his
defence
himself
he
would
have
to
devote
himself
entirely
to
the
court
for
the
time
being
at
least
success
would
mean
later
on
his
complete
and
conclusive
liberation
but
if
he
was
to
achieve
this
he
would
have
to
place
himself
to
start
with
in
far
greater
danger
than
he
had
been
in
so
far
if
he
ever
felt
tempted
to
doubt
this
then
his
experience
with
the
deputy
director
and
the
manufacturer
that
day
would
be
quite
enough
to
convince
him
of
it
how
could
he
have
sat
there
totally
convinced
of
the
need
to
do
his
own
defence
how
would
it
be
later
what
would
his
life
be
like
in
the
days
ahead
would
he
find
the
way
through
it
all
to
a
happy
conclusion
did
a
carefully
worked
out
defence
and
any
other
sort
would
have
made
no
sense
did
a
carefully
worked
out
defence
not
also
mean
he
would
need
to
shut
himself
off
from
everything
else
as
much
as
he
could
would
he
survive
that
and
how
was
he
to
succeed
in
conducting
all
this
at
the
bank
it
involved
much
more
than
just
submitting
some
documents
that
he
could
probably
prepare
in
a
few
days
leave
although
it
would
have
been
great
temerity
to
ask
for
time
off
from
the
bank
just
at
that
time
it
was
a
whole
trial
and
there
was
no
way
of
seeing
how
long
it
might
last
this
was
an
enormous
difficulty
that
had
suddenly
been
thrown
into
life
and
was
he
supposed
to
be
doing
the
bank
work
at
a
time
like
this
he
looked
down
at
his
desk
was
he
supposed
to
let
people
in
to
see
him
and
go
into
negotiations
with
them
at
a
time
like
this
while
his
trial
trundled
on
while
the
court
officials
upstairs
in
the
attic
room
sat
looking
at
the
papers
for
this
trial
should
he
be
worrying
about
the
business
of
the
bank
did
this
not
seem
like
a
kind
of
torture
acknowledged
by
the
court
connected
with
the
trial
and
which
followed
him
around
and
is
it
likely
that
anyone
in
the
bank
when
judging
his
work
would
take
any
account
of
his
peculiar
situation
one
and
never
there
were
those
who
knew
about
his
trial
although
it
was
not
quite
clear
who
knew
about
it
or
how
much
but
he
hoped
rumours
had
not
reached
as
far
as
the
deputy
director
otherwise
he
would
obviously
soon
find
a
way
of
making
use
of
it
to
harm
he
would
show
neither
comradeship
nor
humaneness
and
what
about
the
director
it
was
true
that
he
was
well
disposed
towards
and
as
soon
as
he
heard
about
the
trial
he
would
probably
try
to
do
everything
he
could
to
make
it
easier
for
him
but
he
would
certainly
not
devote
himself
to
it
at
one
time
had
provided
the
to
what
the
deputy
director
said
but
the
director
was
now
coming
more
and
more
under
his
influence
and
the
deputy
director
would
also
exploit
the
weakened
condition
of
the
director
to
strengthen
his
own
power
so
what
could
hope
for
maybe
considerations
of
this
sort
weakened
his
power
of
resistance
but
it
was
still
necessary
not
to
deceive
oneself
and
to
see
everything
as
clearly
as
it
could
be
seen
at
that
moment
for
no
particular
reason
just
to
avoiding
returning
to
his
desk
for
a
while
he
opened
the
window
it
was
difficult
to
open
and
he
had
to
turn
the
handle
with
both
his
hands
then
through
the
whole
height
and
breadth
of
the
window
the
mixture
of
fog
and
smoke
was
drawn
into
the
room
filling
it
with
a
slight
smell
of
burning
a
few
flakes
of
snow
were
blown
in
with
it
it
a
horrible
autumn
said
the
manufacturer
who
had
come
into
the
room
unnoticed
after
seeing
the
deputy
director
and
now
stood
behind
nodded
and
looked
uneasily
at
the
manufacturer
briefcase
from
which
he
would
now
probably
take
the
papers
and
inform
of
the
result
of
his
negotiations
with
the
deputy
director
however
the
manufacturer
saw
where
was
looking
knocked
on
his
briefcase
and
without
opening
it
said
you
be
wanting
to
hear
how
things
turned
out
i
already
got
the
contract
in
my
pocket
almost
he
a
charming
man
your
deputy
director
he
got
his
dangers
though
he
laughed
as
he
shook
hand
and
wanted
to
make
him
laugh
with
him
but
to
it
once
more
seemed
suspicious
that
the
manufacturer
did
not
want
to
show
him
the
papers
and
saw
nothing
about
his
comments
to
laugh
at
chief
clerk
said
the
manufacturer
i
expect
the
weather
been
affecting
your
mood
has
it
you
looking
so
worried
today
yes
said
raising
his
hand
and
holding
the
temple
of
his
head
headaches
worries
in
the
family
quite
right
said
the
manufacturer
who
was
always
in
a
hurry
and
could
never
listen
to
anyone
for
very
long
everyone
has
his
cross
to
bear
had
unconsciously
made
a
step
towards
the
door
as
if
wanting
to
show
the
manufacturer
out
but
the
manufacturer
said
chief
clerk
something
else
i
like
to
mention
to
you
i
very
sorry
if
something
that
be
a
burden
to
you
today
of
all
days
but
i
been
to
see
you
twice
already
lately
and
each
time
i
forgot
all
about
it
if
i
delay
it
any
longer
it
might
well
lose
its
point
altogether
that
would
be
a
pity
as
i
think
what
i
got
to
say
does
have
some
value
before
had
had
the
time
to
answer
the
manufacturer
came
up
close
to
him
tapped
his
knuckle
lightly
on
his
chest
and
said
quietly
got
a
trial
going
on
have
you
stepped
back
and
immediately
exclaimed
that
what
the
deputy
director
been
telling
you
no
no
said
the
manufacturer
how
would
the
deputy
director
know
about
it
and
what
about
you
asked
already
more
in
control
of
himself
i
hear
things
about
the
court
here
and
there
said
the
manufacturer
and
that
even
applies
to
what
it
is
that
i
wanted
to
tell
you
about
there
are
so
many
people
who
have
connections
with
the
court
said
with
lowered
head
and
he
led
the
manufacturer
over
to
his
desk
they
sat
down
where
they
had
been
before
and
the
manufacturer
said
i
afraid
it
not
very
much
that
i
got
to
tell
you
about
only
in
matters
like
this
it
best
not
to
overlook
the
tiniest
details
besides
i
really
want
to
help
you
in
some
way
however
modest
my
help
might
be
we
been
good
business
partners
up
till
now
have
we
well
then
wanted
to
apologise
for
his
behaviour
in
the
conversation
earlier
that
day
but
the
manufacturer
would
tolerate
no
interruption
shoved
his
briefcase
up
high
in
his
armpit
to
show
that
he
was
in
a
hurry
and
carried
on
i
know
about
your
case
through
a
certain
titorelli
he
a
painter
titorelli
just
his
artistic
name
i
do
even
know
what
his
real
name
is
he
been
coming
to
me
in
my
office
for
years
from
time
to
time
and
brings
little
pictures
with
him
which
i
buy
more
or
less
just
for
the
sake
of
charity
as
he
hardly
more
than
a
beggar
and
they
nice
pictures
too
moorland
landscapes
and
that
sort
of
thing
we
both
got
used
to
doing
business
in
this
way
and
it
always
went
smoothly
only
one
time
these
visits
became
a
bit
too
frequent
i
began
to
tell
him
off
for
it
we
started
talking
and
i
became
interested
how
it
was
that
he
could
earn
a
living
just
by
painting
and
then
i
learned
to
my
amazement
that
his
main
source
of
income
was
painting
portraits
work
for
the
court
he
said
court
said
i
and
that
when
he
told
me
about
the
court
i
sure
you
can
imagine
how
amazed
i
was
at
being
told
all
this
ever
since
then
i
learn
something
new
about
the
court
every
time
he
comes
to
visit
and
so
little
by
little
i
get
to
understand
something
of
how
it
works
anyway
titorelli
talks
a
lot
and
i
often
have
to
push
him
away
not
only
because
he
bound
to
be
lying
but
also
most
of
all
because
a
businessman
like
me
who
already
close
to
breaking
point
under
the
weight
of
his
own
business
worries
ca
pay
too
much
attention
to
other
people
but
all
that
just
by
the
by
perhaps
this
is
what
i
been
thinking
perhaps
titorelli
might
be
able
to
help
you
in
some
small
way
he
knows
lots
of
judges
and
even
if
he
have
much
influence
himself
he
can
give
you
some
advice
about
how
to
get
some
influential
people
on
your
side
and
even
if
this
advice
turn
out
to
make
all
the
difference
i
still
think
it
be
very
important
once
you
got
it
you
nearly
a
lawyer
yourself
what
i
always
say
the
chief
clerk
is
nearly
a
lawyer
oh
sure
this
trial
of
yours
will
turn
out
all
right
so
do
you
want
to
go
and
see
titorelli
then
if
i
ask
him
to
he
certainly
do
everything
he
possibly
can
i
really
do
think
you
ought
to
go
it
need
be
today
of
course
just
some
time
when
you
get
the
chance
and
anyway
i
want
to
tell
you
this
too
you
do
actually
have
to
go
and
see
titorelli
this
advice
from
me
does
place
you
under
any
obligation
at
all
no
if
you
think
you
can
get
by
without
titorelli
it
certainly
be
better
to
leave
him
completely
out
of
it
maybe
you
already
got
a
clear
idea
of
what
you
doing
and
titorelli
could
upset
your
plans
no
if
that
the
case
then
of
course
you
should
go
there
under
any
circumstances
and
it
certainly
wo
be
easy
to
take
advice
from
a
lad
like
that
still
it
up
to
you
here
the
letter
of
recommendation
and
here
the
address
disappointed
took
the
letter
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
even
at
best
the
advantage
he
might
derive
from
this
recommendation
was
incomparably
smaller
than
the
damage
that
lay
in
the
fact
of
the
manufacturer
knowing
about
his
trial
and
that
the
painter
was
spreading
the
news
about
it
was
all
he
could
manage
to
give
the
manufacturer
who
was
already
on
his
way
to
the
door
a
few
words
of
thanks
i
go
there
he
said
as
he
took
his
leave
of
the
manufacturer
at
the
door
or
as
i
very
busy
at
present
i
write
to
him
perhaps
he
would
like
to
come
to
me
in
my
office
some
time
i
was
sure
you
find
the
best
solution
said
the
manufacturer
although
i
had
thought
prefer
to
avoid
inviting
people
like
this
titorelli
to
the
bank
and
talking
about
the
trial
here
and
it
not
always
a
good
idea
to
send
letters
to
people
like
titorelli
you
do
know
what
might
happen
to
them
but
you
bound
to
have
thought
everything
through
and
you
know
what
you
can
and
ca
do
nodded
and
accompanied
the
manufacturer
on
through
the
but
despite
seeming
calm
on
the
outside
he
was
actually
very
shocked
he
had
told
the
manufacturer
he
would
write
to
titorelli
only
to
show
him
in
some
way
that
he
valued
his
recommendations
and
would
consider
the
opportunity
to
speak
with
titorelli
without
delay
but
if
he
had
thought
titorelli
could
offer
any
worthwhile
assistance
he
would
not
have
delayed
but
it
was
only
the
manufacturer
comment
that
made
realise
what
dangers
that
could
lead
to
was
he
really
able
to
rely
on
his
own
understanding
so
little
if
it
was
possible
that
he
might
invite
a
questionable
character
into
the
bank
with
a
clear
letter
and
ask
advice
from
him
about
his
trial
separated
from
the
deputy
director
by
no
more
than
a
door
was
it
not
possible
or
even
very
likely
that
there
were
also
other
dangers
he
had
failed
to
see
or
that
he
was
even
running
towards
there
was
not
always
someone
beside
him
to
warn
him
and
just
now
just
when
he
would
have
to
act
with
all
the
strength
he
could
muster
now
a
number
of
doubts
of
a
sort
he
had
never
before
known
had
presented
themselves
and
affected
his
own
vigilance
the
difficulties
he
had
been
feeling
in
carrying
out
his
office
work
were
they
now
going
to
affect
the
trial
too
now
at
least
he
found
himself
quite
unable
to
understand
how
he
could
have
intended
to
write
to
titorelli
and
invite
him
into
the
bank
he
shook
his
head
at
the
thought
of
it
once
more
as
the
servitor
came
up
beside
him
and
drew
his
attention
to
the
three
gentlemen
who
were
waiting
on
a
bench
in
the
they
had
already
been
waiting
to
see
for
a
long
time
now
that
the
servitor
was
speaking
with
they
had
stood
up
and
each
of
them
wanted
to
make
use
of
the
opportunity
to
see
before
the
others
it
had
been
negligent
of
the
bank
to
let
them
waste
their
time
here
in
the
waiting
room
but
none
of
them
wanted
to
draw
attention
to
this
one
of
them
was
saying
but
had
told
the
servitor
to
fetch
his
winter
coat
and
said
to
the
three
of
them
as
the
servitor
helped
him
to
put
it
on
please
forgive
me
gentlemen
i
afraid
i
have
no
time
to
see
you
at
present
please
do
forgive
me
but
i
have
some
urgent
business
to
settle
and
have
to
leave
straight
away
you
already
seen
yourselves
how
long
i
been
delayed
would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
come
back
tomorrow
or
some
time
or
perhaps
we
could
settle
your
affairs
by
telephone
or
perhaps
you
would
like
to
tell
me
now
briefly
what
it
about
and
i
can
then
give
you
a
full
answer
in
writing
whatever
the
best
thing
will
be
for
you
to
come
here
again
the
gentlemen
now
saw
that
their
wait
had
been
totally
pointless
and
these
suggestions
of
left
them
so
astounded
that
they
looked
at
each
other
without
a
word
that
agreed
then
is
it
asked
who
had
turned
toward
the
servitor
bringing
him
his
hat
through
the
open
door
of
office
they
could
see
that
the
snowfall
outside
had
become
much
heavier
so
turned
the
collar
of
his
coat
up
and
buttoned
it
up
high
under
his
chin
just
then
the
deputy
director
came
out
of
the
adjoining
room
smiled
as
he
saw
negotiating
with
the
gentlemen
in
his
winter
coat
and
asked
are
you
about
to
go
out
yes
said
standing
more
upright
i
have
to
go
out
on
some
business
but
the
deputy
director
had
already
turned
towards
the
gentlemen
and
what
about
these
gentlemen
he
asked
i
think
they
already
been
waiting
quite
a
long
time
we
already
come
to
an
understanding
said
but
now
the
gentlemen
could
be
held
back
no
longer
they
surrounded
and
explained
that
they
would
not
have
been
waiting
for
hours
if
it
had
not
been
about
something
important
that
had
to
be
discussed
now
at
length
and
in
private
the
deputy
director
listened
to
them
for
a
short
while
he
also
looked
at
as
he
held
his
hat
in
his
hand
cleaning
the
dust
off
it
here
and
there
and
then
he
said
gentlemen
there
is
a
very
simple
way
to
solve
this
if
you
would
prefer
it
i
be
very
glad
to
take
over
these
negotiations
instead
of
the
chief
clerk
your
business
does
of
course
need
to
be
discussed
without
delay
we
are
businessmen
like
yourselves
and
know
the
value
of
a
businessman
time
would
you
like
to
come
this
way
and
he
opened
the
door
leading
to
the
of
his
own
office
the
deputy
director
seemed
very
good
at
appropriating
everything
that
was
now
forced
to
give
up
but
was
not
giving
up
more
than
he
absolutely
had
to
by
running
off
to
some
unknown
painter
with
as
he
had
to
admit
very
little
hope
of
any
vague
benefit
his
renown
was
suffering
damage
that
could
not
be
repaired
it
would
probably
be
much
better
to
take
off
his
winter
coat
again
and
at
the
very
least
try
to
win
back
the
two
gentlemen
who
were
certainly
still
waiting
in
the
next
room
if
had
not
then
glimpsed
the
deputy
director
in
his
office
looking
for
something
from
his
bookshelves
as
if
they
were
his
own
he
would
probably
even
have
made
the
attempt
as
somewhat
agitated
approached
the
door
the
deputy
director
called
out
oh
you
still
not
left
he
turned
his
face
toward
him
its
many
deep
folds
seemed
to
show
strength
rather
than
age
and
immediately
began
once
more
to
search
i
looking
for
a
copy
of
a
contract
he
said
which
this
gentleman
insists
you
must
have
could
you
help
me
look
for
it
do
you
think
made
a
step
forward
but
the
deputy
director
said
thank
you
i
already
found
it
and
with
a
big
package
of
papers
which
certainly
must
have
included
many
more
documents
than
just
the
copy
of
the
contract
he
turned
and
went
back
into
his
own
office
i
ca
deal
with
him
right
now
said
to
himself
but
once
my
personal
difficulties
have
been
settled
then
he
certainly
be
the
first
to
get
the
effect
of
it
and
he
certainly
wo
like
it
slightly
calmed
by
these
thoughts
gave
the
servitor
who
had
already
long
been
holding
the
door
to
the
corridor
open
for
him
the
task
of
telling
the
director
when
he
was
able
that
was
going
out
of
the
bank
on
a
business
matter
as
he
left
the
bank
he
felt
almost
happy
at
the
thought
of
being
able
to
devote
more
of
himself
to
his
own
business
for
a
while
he
went
straight
to
the
painter
who
lived
in
an
outlying
part
of
town
which
was
very
near
to
the
court
offices
although
this
area
was
even
poorer
the
houses
were
darker
the
streets
were
full
of
dirt
that
slowly
blew
about
over
the
snow
in
the
great
gateway
to
the
building
where
the
painter
lived
only
one
of
the
two
doors
was
open
a
hole
had
been
broken
open
in
the
wall
by
the
other
door
and
as
approached
it
a
repulsive
yellow
steaming
liquid
shot
out
causing
some
rats
to
scurry
away
into
the
nearby
canal
down
by
the
staircase
there
was
a
small
child
lying
on
its
belly
crying
but
it
could
hardly
be
heard
because
of
the
noise
from
a
on
the
other
side
of
the
entrance
hall
drowning
out
any
other
sound
the
door
to
the
workshop
was
open
three
workers
stood
in
a
circle
around
some
piece
of
work
that
they
were
beating
with
hammers
a
large
tin
plate
hung
on
the
wall
casting
a
pale
light
that
pushed
its
way
in
between
two
of
the
workers
lighting
up
their
faces
and
their
did
no
more
than
glance
at
any
of
these
things
he
wanted
to
get
things
over
with
here
as
soon
as
possible
to
exchange
just
a
few
words
to
find
out
how
things
stood
with
the
painter
and
go
straight
back
to
the
bank
even
if
he
had
just
some
tiny
success
here
it
would
still
have
a
good
effect
on
his
work
at
the
bank
for
that
day
on
the
third
floor
he
had
to
slow
down
his
pace
he
was
quite
out
of
breath
the
steps
just
like
the
height
of
each
floor
were
much
higher
than
they
needed
to
be
and
been
told
that
the
painter
lived
right
up
in
the
attic
the
air
was
also
quite
oppressive
there
was
no
proper
stairwell
and
the
narrow
steps
were
closed
in
by
walls
on
both
sides
with
no
more
than
a
small
high
window
here
and
there
just
as
paused
for
a
while
some
young
girls
ran
out
of
one
of
the
flats
and
rushed
higher
up
the
stairs
laughing
followed
them
slowly
caught
up
with
one
of
the
girls
who
had
stumbled
and
been
left
behind
by
the
others
and
asked
her
as
they
went
up
side
by
side
is
there
a
painter
titorelli
who
lives
here
the
girl
hardly
thirteen
years
old
and
somewhat
hunchbacked
jabbed
him
with
her
elbow
and
looked
at
him
sideways
her
youth
and
her
bodily
defects
had
done
nothing
to
stop
her
being
already
quite
depraved
she
did
not
smile
once
but
looked
at
earnestly
with
sharp
acquisitive
eyes
pretended
not
to
notice
her
behaviour
and
asked
do
you
know
titorelli
the
painter
she
nodded
and
asked
in
reply
what
want
to
see
him
for
thought
it
would
be
to
his
advantage
quickly
to
find
out
something
more
about
titorelli
i
want
to
have
him
paint
my
portrait
he
said
paint
your
portrait
she
asked
opening
her
mouth
too
wide
and
lightly
hitting
with
her
hand
as
if
he
had
said
something
extraordinarily
surprising
or
clumsy
with
both
hands
she
lifted
her
skirt
which
was
already
very
short
and
as
fast
as
she
could
she
ran
off
after
the
other
girls
whose
indistinct
shouts
lost
themselves
in
the
heights
at
the
next
turn
of
the
stairs
however
encountered
all
the
girls
once
more
the
hunchbacked
girl
had
clearly
told
them
about
intentions
and
they
were
waiting
for
him
they
stood
on
both
sides
of
the
stairs
pressing
themselves
against
the
wall
so
that
could
get
through
between
them
and
smoothed
their
aprons
down
with
their
hands
all
their
faces
even
in
this
guard
of
honour
showed
a
mixture
of
childishness
and
depravity
up
at
the
head
of
the
line
of
girls
who
now
laughing
began
to
close
in
around
was
the
hunchback
who
had
taken
on
the
role
of
leader
it
was
thanks
to
her
that
found
the
right
direction
without
delay
he
would
have
continued
up
the
stairs
straight
in
front
of
him
but
she
showed
him
that
to
reach
titorelli
he
would
need
to
turn
off
to
one
side
the
steps
that
led
up
to
the
painter
were
especially
narrow
very
long
without
any
turning
the
whole
length
could
be
seen
in
one
glance
and
at
the
top
at
titorelli
closed
door
it
came
to
its
end
this
door
was
much
better
illuminated
than
the
rest
of
the
stairway
by
the
light
from
a
small
skylight
set
obliquely
above
it
it
had
been
put
together
from
unpainted
planks
of
wood
and
the
name
was
painted
on
it
in
broad
red
brushstrokes
was
no
more
than
half
way
up
the
steps
accompanied
by
his
retinue
of
girls
when
clearly
the
result
of
the
noise
of
all
those
footsteps
the
door
opened
slightly
and
in
the
crack
a
man
who
seemed
to
be
dressed
in
just
his
nightshirt
appeared
oh
he
cried
when
he
saw
the
approaching
crowd
and
vanished
the
hunchbacked
girl
clapped
her
hands
in
glee
and
the
other
girls
crowded
in
behind
to
push
him
faster
forward
they
still
had
not
arrived
at
the
top
however
when
the
painter
up
above
them
suddenly
pulled
the
door
wide
open
and
with
a
deep
bow
invited
to
enter
the
girls
on
the
other
hand
he
tried
to
keep
away
he
did
not
want
to
let
any
of
them
in
however
much
they
begged
him
and
however
much
they
tried
to
get
in
if
they
could
not
get
in
with
his
permission
they
would
try
to
force
their
way
in
against
his
will
the
only
one
to
succeed
was
the
hunchback
when
she
slipped
through
under
his
outstretched
arm
but
the
painter
chased
after
her
grabbed
her
by
the
skirt
span
her
once
round
and
set
her
down
again
by
the
door
with
the
other
girls
who
unlike
the
first
had
not
dared
to
cross
the
doorstep
while
the
painter
had
left
his
post
did
not
know
what
he
was
to
make
of
all
this
as
they
all
seemed
to
be
having
fun
one
behind
the
other
the
girls
by
the
door
stretched
their
necks
up
high
and
called
out
various
words
to
the
painter
which
were
meant
in
jest
but
which
did
not
understand
and
even
the
painter
laughed
as
the
hunchback
whirled
round
in
his
hand
then
he
shut
the
door
bowed
once
more
to
offered
him
his
hand
and
introduced
himself
saying
titorelli
painter
pointed
to
the
door
behind
which
the
girls
were
whispering
and
said
you
seem
to
be
very
popular
in
this
building
ach
those
brats
said
the
painter
trying
in
vain
to
fasten
his
nightshirt
at
the
neck
he
was
also
and
apart
from
that
was
wearing
nothing
more
than
a
loose
pair
of
yellowish
linen
trousers
held
up
with
a
belt
whose
free
end
whipped
to
and
fro
those
kids
are
a
real
burden
for
me
he
continued
the
top
button
of
his
nightshirt
came
off
and
he
gave
up
trying
to
fasten
it
fetched
a
chair
for
and
made
him
sit
down
on
it
i
painted
one
of
them
once
not
here
today
and
ever
since
then
they
been
following
me
about
if
i
here
they
only
come
in
when
i
allow
it
but
as
soon
as
i
gone
out
there
always
at
least
one
of
them
in
here
they
had
a
key
made
to
my
door
and
lend
it
round
to
each
other
it
hard
to
imagine
what
a
pain
that
is
suppose
i
come
back
home
with
a
lady
i
going
to
paint
i
open
the
door
with
my
own
key
and
find
the
hunchback
there
or
something
by
the
table
painting
her
lips
red
with
my
paintbrush
and
meanwhile
her
little
sisters
will
be
keeping
guard
for
her
moving
about
and
causing
chaos
in
every
corner
of
the
room
or
else
like
happened
yesterday
i
might
come
back
home
late
in
the
evening
please
forgive
my
appearance
and
the
room
being
in
a
mess
it
is
to
do
with
them
so
i
might
come
home
late
in
the
evening
and
want
to
go
to
bed
then
i
feel
something
pinching
my
leg
look
under
the
bed
and
pull
another
of
them
out
from
under
it
i
do
know
why
it
is
they
bother
me
like
this
i
expect
you
just
seen
that
i
do
nothing
to
encourage
them
to
come
near
me
and
they
make
it
hard
for
me
to
do
my
work
too
of
course
if
i
did
get
this
studio
for
nothing
i
have
moved
out
a
long
time
ago
just
then
a
little
voice
tender
and
anxious
called
out
from
under
the
door
titorelli
can
we
come
in
now
no
answered
the
painter
not
even
just
me
by
myself
the
voice
asked
again
not
even
just
you
said
the
painter
as
he
went
to
the
door
and
locked
it
meanwhile
had
been
looking
round
the
room
if
it
had
not
been
pointed
out
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
him
that
this
wretched
little
room
could
be
called
a
studio
it
was
hardly
long
enough
or
broad
enough
to
make
two
steps
everything
floor
walls
and
ceiling
was
made
of
wood
between
the
planks
narrow
gaps
could
be
seen
across
from
where
was
the
bed
stood
against
the
wall
under
a
covering
of
many
different
colours
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
picture
stood
on
an
easel
covered
over
with
a
shirt
whose
arms
dangled
down
to
the
ground
behind
was
the
window
through
which
the
fog
made
it
impossible
to
see
further
than
the
snow
covered
roof
of
the
neighbouring
building
the
turning
of
the
key
in
the
lock
reminded
that
he
had
not
wanted
to
stay
too
long
so
he
drew
the
manufacturer
letter
out
from
his
pocket
held
it
out
to
the
painter
and
said
i
learned
about
you
from
this
gentleman
an
acquaintance
of
yours
and
it
on
his
advice
that
i
come
here
the
painter
glanced
through
the
letter
and
threw
it
down
onto
the
bed
if
the
manufacturer
had
not
said
very
clearly
that
titorelli
was
an
acquaintance
of
his
a
poor
man
who
was
dependent
on
his
charity
then
it
would
really
have
been
quite
possible
to
believe
that
titorelli
did
not
know
him
or
at
least
that
he
could
not
remember
him
this
impression
was
augmented
by
the
painter
asking
were
you
wanting
to
buy
some
pictures
or
did
you
want
to
have
yourself
painted
looked
at
the
painter
in
astonishment
what
did
the
letter
actually
say
had
taken
it
as
a
matter
of
course
that
the
manufacturer
had
explained
to
the
painter
in
his
letter
that
wanted
nothing
more
with
him
than
to
find
out
more
about
his
trial
he
had
been
far
too
rash
in
coming
here
but
now
he
had
to
give
the
painter
some
sort
of
answer
and
glancing
at
the
easel
said
are
you
working
on
a
picture
currently
yes
said
the
painter
and
he
took
the
shirt
hanging
over
the
easel
and
threw
it
onto
the
bed
after
the
letter
it
a
portrait
quite
a
good
piece
of
work
although
it
not
quite
finished
yet
this
was
a
convenient
coincidence
for
it
gave
him
a
good
opportunity
to
talk
about
the
court
as
the
picture
showed
very
clearly
a
judge
what
more
it
was
remarkably
similar
to
the
picture
in
the
office
although
this
one
showed
a
quite
different
judge
a
heavy
man
with
a
full
beard
which
was
black
and
bushy
and
extended
to
the
sides
far
up
the
man
cheeks
the
lawyer
picture
was
also
an
oil
painting
whereas
this
one
had
been
made
with
pastel
colours
and
was
pale
and
unclear
but
everything
else
about
the
picture
was
similar
as
this
judge
too
was
holding
tightly
to
the
arm
of
his
throne
and
seemed
ominously
about
to
rise
from
it
at
first
was
about
to
say
he
certainly
is
a
judge
but
he
held
himself
back
for
the
time
being
and
went
closer
to
the
picture
as
if
he
wanted
to
study
it
in
detail
there
was
a
large
figure
shown
in
middle
of
the
throne
back
rest
which
could
not
understand
and
asked
the
painter
about
it
that
need
some
more
work
done
on
it
the
painter
told
him
and
taking
a
pastel
crayon
from
a
small
table
he
added
a
few
strokes
to
the
edges
of
the
figure
but
without
making
it
any
clearer
as
far
as
could
make
out
that
the
figure
of
justice
said
the
painter
finally
now
i
see
said
here
the
blindfold
and
here
are
the
scales
but
are
those
wings
on
her
heels
and
is
she
moving
yes
said
the
painter
i
had
to
paint
it
like
that
according
to
the
contract
it
actually
the
figure
of
justice
and
the
goddess
of
victory
all
in
one
that
is
not
a
good
combination
said
with
a
smile
justice
needs
to
remain
still
otherwise
the
scales
will
move
about
and
it
wo
be
possible
to
make
a
just
verdict
i
just
doing
what
the
client
wanted
said
the
painter
yes
certainly
said
who
had
not
meant
to
criticise
anyone
by
that
comment
you
painted
the
figure
as
it
actually
appears
on
the
throne
no
said
the
painter
i
never
seen
that
figure
or
that
throne
it
all
just
invention
but
they
told
me
what
it
was
i
had
to
paint
how
that
asked
pretending
not
fully
to
understand
what
the
painter
said
that
is
a
judge
sitting
on
the
judge
chair
is
it
yes
said
the
painter
but
that
judge
is
very
high
up
and
he
never
sat
on
any
throne
like
that
and
he
has
himself
painted
in
such
a
grand
pose
he
sitting
there
just
like
the
president
of
the
court
yeah
gentlemen
like
this
are
very
vain
said
the
painter
but
they
have
permission
from
higher
up
to
get
themselves
painted
like
this
it
laid
down
quite
strictly
just
what
sort
of
portrait
each
of
them
can
get
for
himself
only
it
a
pity
that
you
ca
make
out
the
details
of
his
costume
and
pose
in
this
picture
pastel
colours
are
really
suitable
for
showing
people
like
this
yes
said
it
does
seem
odd
that
it
in
pastel
colours
that
what
the
judge
wanted
said
the
painter
it
meant
to
be
for
a
woman
the
sight
of
the
picture
seemed
to
make
him
feel
like
working
he
rolled
up
his
shirtsleeves
picked
up
a
few
of
the
crayons
and
watched
as
a
reddish
shadow
built
up
around
the
head
of
the
judge
under
their
quivering
tips
and
radiated
out
the
to
edges
of
the
picture
this
shadow
play
slowly
surrounded
the
head
like
a
decoration
or
lofty
distinction
but
around
the
figure
of
justice
apart
from
some
coloration
that
was
barely
noticeable
it
remained
light
and
in
this
brightness
the
figure
seemed
to
shine
forward
so
that
it
now
looked
like
neither
the
god
of
justice
nor
the
god
of
victory
it
seemed
now
rather
to
be
a
perfect
depiction
of
the
god
of
the
hunt
found
the
painter
work
more
engrossing
than
he
had
wanted
but
finally
he
reproached
himself
for
staying
so
long
without
having
done
anything
relevant
to
his
own
affair
what
the
name
of
this
judge
he
asked
suddenly
i
not
allowed
to
tell
you
that
the
painter
answered
he
was
bent
deeply
over
the
picture
and
clearly
neglecting
his
guest
who
at
first
he
had
received
with
such
care
took
this
to
be
just
a
foible
of
the
painter
and
it
irritated
him
as
it
made
him
lose
time
i
take
it
you
must
be
a
trustee
of
the
court
he
said
the
painter
immediately
put
his
crayons
down
stood
upright
rubbed
his
hands
together
and
looked
at
with
a
smile
always
straight
out
with
the
truth
he
said
you
want
to
learn
something
about
the
court
like
it
says
in
your
letter
of
recommendation
but
then
you
start
talking
about
my
pictures
to
get
me
on
your
side
still
i
wo
hold
it
against
you
you
were
to
know
that
that
was
entirely
the
wrong
thing
to
try
with
me
oh
please
he
said
sharply
repelling
attempt
to
make
some
objection
he
then
continued
and
besides
you
quite
right
in
your
comment
that
i
a
trustee
of
the
court
he
made
a
pause
as
if
wanting
to
give
the
time
to
come
to
terms
with
this
fact
the
girls
could
once
more
be
heard
from
behind
the
door
they
were
probably
pressed
around
the
keyhole
perhaps
they
could
even
see
into
the
room
through
the
gaps
in
the
planks
forewent
the
opportunity
to
excuse
himself
in
some
way
as
he
did
not
wish
to
distract
the
painter
from
what
he
was
saying
or
else
perhaps
he
did
want
him
to
get
too
far
above
himself
and
in
this
way
make
himself
to
some
extent
unattainable
so
he
asked
is
that
a
publicly
acknowledged
position
no
was
the
painter
curt
reply
as
if
the
question
prevented
him
saying
any
more
but
wanted
him
to
continue
speaking
and
said
well
positions
like
that
that
are
officially
acknowledged
can
often
have
more
influence
than
those
that
are
and
that
how
it
is
with
me
said
the
painter
and
nodded
with
a
frown
i
was
talking
about
your
case
with
the
manufacturer
yesterday
and
he
asked
me
if
i
would
like
to
help
you
and
i
answered
can
come
and
see
me
if
he
likes
and
now
pleased
to
see
you
here
so
soon
this
business
seems
to
be
quite
important
to
you
and
of
course
i
not
surprised
at
that
would
you
not
like
to
take
your
coat
off
now
had
intended
to
stay
for
only
a
very
short
time
but
the
painter
invitation
was
nonetheless
very
welcome
the
air
in
the
room
had
slowly
become
quite
oppressive
for
him
he
had
several
times
looked
in
amazement
at
a
small
iron
stove
in
the
corner
that
certainly
could
not
have
been
lit
the
heat
of
the
room
was
inexplicable
as
he
took
off
his
winter
overcoat
and
also
unbuttoned
his
frock
coat
the
painter
said
to
him
in
apology
i
must
have
warmth
and
it
is
very
cosy
here
is
it
this
room
very
good
in
that
respect
made
no
reply
but
it
was
actually
not
the
heat
that
made
him
uncomfortable
but
much
more
the
stuffiness
the
air
that
almost
made
it
more
difficult
to
breathe
the
room
had
probably
not
been
ventilated
for
a
long
time
the
unpleasantness
of
this
was
made
all
the
stronger
for
when
the
painter
invited
him
to
sit
on
the
bed
while
he
himself
sat
down
on
the
only
chair
in
the
room
in
front
of
the
easel
the
painter
even
seemed
to
misunderstand
why
remained
at
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
urged
to
make
himself
comfortable
and
as
he
hesitated
he
went
over
to
the
bed
himself
and
pressed
deep
down
into
the
bedclothes
and
pillows
then
he
went
back
to
his
seat
and
at
last
he
asked
his
first
objective
question
which
made
forget
everything
else
you
innocent
are
you
he
asked
yes
said
he
felt
a
simple
joy
at
answering
this
question
especially
as
the
answer
was
given
to
a
private
individual
and
therefore
would
have
no
consequences
up
till
then
had
asked
him
this
question
so
openly
to
make
the
most
of
his
pleasure
he
added
i
am
totally
innocent
so
said
the
painter
and
he
lowered
his
head
and
seemed
to
be
thinking
suddenly
he
raised
his
head
again
and
said
well
if
you
innocent
it
all
very
simple
began
to
scowl
this
supposed
trustee
of
the
court
was
talking
like
an
ignorant
child
my
being
innocent
does
not
make
things
simple
said
despite
everything
he
could
help
smiling
and
slowly
shook
his
head
there
are
many
fine
details
in
which
the
court
gets
lost
but
in
the
end
it
reaches
into
some
place
where
originally
there
was
nothing
and
pulls
enormous
guilt
out
of
it
yeah
yeah
sure
said
the
painter
as
if
had
been
disturbing
his
train
of
thought
for
no
reason
but
you
are
innocent
are
you
well
of
course
i
am
said
that
the
main
thing
said
the
painter
there
was
no
that
could
influence
him
but
although
he
had
made
up
his
mind
it
was
not
clear
whether
he
was
talking
this
way
because
of
conviction
or
indifference
then
wanted
to
find
out
and
said
therefore
i
sure
you
more
familiar
with
the
court
than
i
am
i
know
hardly
more
about
it
than
what
i
heard
and
that
been
from
many
very
different
people
but
they
were
all
agreed
on
one
thing
and
that
was
that
when
ill
accusations
are
made
they
are
not
ignored
and
that
once
the
court
has
made
an
accusation
it
is
convinced
of
the
guilt
of
the
defendant
and
it
very
hard
to
make
it
think
otherwise
very
hard
the
painter
asked
throwing
one
hand
up
in
the
air
it
impossible
to
make
it
think
otherwise
if
i
painted
all
the
judges
next
to
each
other
here
on
canvas
and
you
were
trying
to
defend
yourself
in
front
of
it
you
have
more
success
with
them
than
ever
have
with
the
real
court
yes
said
to
himself
forgetting
that
he
had
only
gone
there
to
investigate
the
painter
one
of
the
girls
behind
the
door
started
up
again
and
asked
titorelli
is
he
going
to
go
soon
quiet
shouted
the
painter
at
the
door
ca
you
see
i
talking
with
the
gentleman
but
this
was
not
enough
to
satisfy
the
girl
and
she
asked
you
going
to
paint
his
picture
and
when
the
painter
did
answer
she
added
please
paint
him
he
an
bloke
there
followed
an
incomprehensible
interwoven
babble
of
shouts
and
replies
and
calls
of
agreement
the
painter
leapt
over
to
the
door
opened
it
very
slightly
the
clasped
hands
could
be
seen
stretching
through
the
crack
as
if
they
wanted
something
and
said
if
you
not
quiet
i
throw
you
all
down
the
stairs
sit
down
here
on
the
steps
and
be
quiet
they
probably
did
not
obey
him
immediately
so
that
he
had
to
command
down
on
the
steps
only
then
it
became
quiet
i
sorry
about
that
said
the
painter
as
he
returned
to
had
hardly
turned
towards
the
door
he
had
left
it
completely
up
to
the
painter
whether
and
how
he
would
place
him
under
his
protection
if
he
wanted
to
even
now
he
made
hardly
any
movement
as
the
painter
bent
over
him
and
whispering
into
his
ear
in
order
not
to
be
heard
outside
said
these
girls
belong
to
the
court
as
well
how
that
asked
as
he
leant
his
head
to
one
side
and
looked
at
the
painter
but
the
painter
sat
back
down
on
his
chair
and
half
in
jest
half
in
explanation
well
everything
belongs
to
the
court
that
is
something
i
had
never
noticed
until
now
said
curtly
this
general
comment
of
the
painter
made
his
comment
about
the
girls
far
less
disturbing
nonetheless
looked
for
a
while
at
the
door
behind
which
the
girls
were
now
sitting
quietly
on
the
steps
except
that
one
of
them
had
pushed
a
drinking
straw
through
a
crack
between
the
planks
and
was
moving
it
slowly
up
and
down
you
still
do
seem
to
have
much
general
idea
of
what
the
court
about
said
the
painter
who
had
stretched
his
legs
wide
apart
and
was
tapping
loudly
on
the
floor
with
the
tip
of
his
foot
but
as
you
innocent
you
wo
need
it
anyway
i
get
you
out
of
this
by
myself
how
do
you
intend
to
do
that
asked
you
did
say
yourself
not
long
ago
that
it
quite
impossible
to
go
to
the
court
with
reasons
and
proofs
only
impossible
for
reasons
and
proofs
you
take
to
the
court
yourself
said
the
painter
raising
his
forefinger
as
if
had
failed
to
notice
a
fine
distinction
it
goes
differently
if
you
try
to
do
something
behind
the
public
court
that
to
say
in
the
consultation
rooms
in
the
corridors
or
here
for
instance
in
my
studio
now
began
to
find
it
far
easier
to
believe
what
the
painter
was
saying
or
rather
it
was
largely
in
agreement
with
what
he
had
also
been
told
by
others
in
fact
it
was
even
quite
promising
if
it
really
was
so
easy
to
influence
the
judges
through
personal
contacts
as
the
lawyer
had
said
then
the
painter
contacts
with
these
vain
judges
was
especially
important
and
at
the
very
least
should
not
be
undervalued
and
the
painter
would
fit
in
very
well
in
the
circle
of
assistants
that
was
slowly
gathering
around
himself
he
had
been
noted
at
the
bank
for
his
talent
in
organising
here
where
he
was
placed
entirely
on
his
own
resources
would
be
a
good
opportunity
to
test
that
talent
to
its
limits
the
painter
observed
the
effect
his
explanation
had
had
on
and
then
with
a
certain
unease
said
does
it
not
occur
to
you
that
the
way
i
speaking
is
almost
like
a
lawyer
it
the
incessant
contact
with
the
gentlemen
of
the
court
has
that
influence
on
me
i
gain
a
lot
by
it
of
course
but
i
lose
a
lot
artistically
speaking
how
did
you
first
come
into
contact
with
the
judges
then
asked
he
wanted
first
to
gain
the
painter
trust
before
he
took
him
into
his
service
that
was
very
easy
said
the
painter
i
inherited
these
contacts
my
father
was
court
painter
before
me
it
a
position
that
always
inherited
they
ca
use
new
people
for
it
the
rules
governing
how
the
various
grades
of
officials
are
painted
are
so
many
and
varied
and
above
all
so
secret
that
one
outside
of
certain
families
even
knows
them
in
the
drawer
there
for
instance
i
got
my
father
notes
which
i
do
show
to
anyone
but
you
only
able
to
paint
judges
if
you
know
what
they
say
although
even
if
i
lost
them
could
ever
dispute
my
position
because
of
all
the
rules
i
just
carry
round
in
my
head
all
the
judges
want
to
be
painted
like
the
old
great
judges
were
and
i
the
only
one
who
can
do
that
you
are
to
be
envied
said
thinking
of
his
position
at
the
bank
your
position
is
quite
unassailable
then
yes
quite
unassailable
said
the
painter
and
he
raised
his
shoulders
in
pride
that
how
i
can
even
afford
to
help
some
poor
man
facing
trial
now
and
then
and
how
do
you
do
that
asked
as
if
the
painter
had
not
just
described
him
as
a
poor
man
the
painter
did
not
let
himself
be
distracted
but
said
in
your
case
for
instance
as
you
totally
innocent
this
is
what
i
do
the
repeated
mention
of
innocence
was
becoming
irksome
to
him
it
sometimes
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
painter
was
using
these
comments
to
make
a
favourable
outcome
to
the
trial
a
precondition
for
his
help
which
of
course
would
make
the
help
itself
unnecessary
but
despite
these
doubts
forced
himself
not
to
interrupt
the
painter
he
did
not
want
to
do
without
the
help
that
was
what
he
had
decided
and
this
help
did
not
seem
in
any
way
less
questionable
than
that
of
the
lawyer
valued
the
help
far
more
highly
because
it
was
offered
in
a
way
that
was
more
harmless
and
open
the
painter
had
pulled
his
seat
closer
to
the
bed
and
continued
in
a
subdued
voice
i
forgot
to
ask
you
what
sort
of
acquittal
is
it
you
want
there
are
three
possibilities
absolute
acquittal
apparent
acquittal
and
deferment
absolute
acquittal
is
the
best
of
course
only
there
nothing
i
could
do
to
get
that
sort
of
outcome
i
think
there
anyone
at
all
who
could
do
anything
to
get
an
absolute
acquittal
probably
the
only
thing
that
could
do
that
is
if
the
accused
is
innocent
as
you
are
innocent
it
could
actually
be
possible
and
you
could
depend
on
your
innocence
alone
in
that
case
you
wo
need
me
or
any
other
kind
of
help
at
first
was
astonished
at
this
orderly
explanation
but
then
just
as
quietly
as
the
painter
he
said
i
think
you
contradicting
yourself
how
that
asked
the
painter
patiently
leaning
back
with
a
smile
this
smile
made
feel
as
if
he
were
examining
not
the
words
of
the
painter
but
seeking
out
inconsistencies
in
the
procedures
of
the
court
itself
nonetheless
he
continued
unabashed
and
said
you
remarked
earlier
that
the
court
can
not
be
approached
with
reasoned
proofs
you
later
restricted
this
to
the
open
court
and
now
you
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
an
innocent
man
needs
no
assistance
in
court
that
entails
a
contradiction
moreover
you
said
earlier
that
the
judges
can
be
influenced
personally
but
now
you
insist
that
an
absolute
acquittal
as
you
call
it
can
never
be
attained
through
personal
influence
that
entails
a
second
contradiction
it
quite
easy
to
clear
up
these
contradictions
said
the
painter
we
talking
about
two
different
things
here
there
what
it
says
in
the
law
and
there
what
i
know
from
my
own
experience
you
should
get
the
two
confused
i
never
seen
it
in
writing
but
the
law
does
of
course
say
on
the
one
hand
that
the
innocent
will
be
set
free
but
on
the
other
hand
it
does
say
that
the
judges
can
be
influenced
but
in
my
experience
it
the
other
way
round
i
do
know
of
any
absolute
acquittals
but
i
do
know
of
many
times
when
a
judge
has
been
influenced
it
possible
of
course
that
there
was
no
innocence
in
any
of
the
cases
i
know
about
but
is
that
likely
not
a
single
innocent
defendant
in
so
many
cases
when
i
was
a
boy
i
used
to
listen
closely
to
my
father
when
he
told
us
about
court
cases
at
home
and
the
judges
that
came
to
his
studio
talked
about
the
court
in
our
circles
nobody
talks
about
anything
else
i
hardly
ever
got
the
chance
to
go
to
court
myself
but
always
made
use
of
it
when
i
could
i
listened
to
countless
trials
at
important
stages
in
their
development
i
followed
them
closely
as
far
as
they
could
be
followed
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
never
seen
a
single
acquittal
so
not
a
single
acquittal
said
as
if
talking
to
himself
and
his
hopes
that
confirms
the
impression
i
already
have
of
the
court
so
there
no
point
in
it
from
this
side
either
they
could
replace
the
whole
court
with
a
single
hangman
you
should
generalise
said
the
painter
dissatisfied
i
only
been
talking
about
my
own
experience
well
that
enough
said
or
have
you
heard
of
any
acquittals
that
happened
earlier
they
say
there
have
been
some
acquittals
earlier
the
painter
answered
but
it
very
hard
to
be
sure
about
it
the
courts
do
make
their
final
conclusions
public
not
even
the
judges
are
allowed
to
know
about
them
so
that
all
we
know
about
these
earlier
cases
are
just
legends
but
most
of
them
did
involve
absolute
acquittals
you
can
believe
that
but
they
ca
be
proved
on
the
other
hand
you
should
forget
all
about
them
either
i
sure
there
is
some
truth
to
them
and
they
are
very
beautiful
painted
a
few
pictures
myself
depicting
these
legends
my
assessment
will
not
be
altered
by
mere
legends
said
i
do
suppose
possible
to
cite
these
legends
in
court
is
it
the
painter
laughed
no
you
ca
cite
them
in
court
he
said
then
there
no
point
in
talking
about
them
said
he
wanted
for
the
time
being
to
accept
anything
the
painter
told
him
even
if
he
thought
it
unlikely
or
contradicted
what
he
had
been
told
by
others
he
did
not
now
have
the
time
to
examine
the
truth
of
everything
the
painter
said
or
even
to
disprove
it
he
would
have
achieved
as
much
as
he
could
if
the
painter
would
help
him
in
any
way
even
if
his
help
would
not
be
decisive
as
a
result
he
said
so
let
pay
no
more
attention
to
absolute
acquittal
but
you
mentioned
two
other
possibilities
apparent
acquittal
and
deferment
they
the
only
possibilities
said
the
painter
but
before
we
talk
about
them
would
you
not
like
to
take
your
coat
off
you
must
be
hot
yes
said
who
until
then
had
paid
attention
to
nothing
but
the
painter
explanations
but
now
that
he
had
had
the
heat
pointed
out
to
him
his
brow
began
to
sweat
heavily
it
almost
unbearable
the
painter
nodded
as
if
he
understood
discomfort
very
well
could
we
not
open
the
window
asked
no
said
the
painter
it
only
a
fixed
pane
of
glass
it
ca
be
opened
now
realised
that
all
this
time
he
had
been
hoping
the
painter
would
suddenly
go
over
to
the
window
and
pull
it
open
he
had
prepared
himself
even
for
the
fog
that
he
would
breathe
in
through
his
open
mouth
the
thought
that
here
he
was
entirely
cut
off
from
the
air
made
him
feel
dizzy
he
tapped
lightly
on
the
bedspread
beside
him
and
with
a
weak
voice
said
that
is
very
inconvenient
and
unhealthy
oh
no
said
the
painter
in
defence
of
his
window
as
it
ca
be
opened
this
room
retains
the
heat
better
than
if
the
window
were
double
glazed
even
though
it
only
a
single
pane
there
not
much
need
to
air
the
room
as
there
so
much
ventilation
through
the
gaps
in
the
wood
but
when
i
do
want
to
i
can
open
one
of
my
doors
or
even
both
of
them
was
slightly
consoled
by
this
explanation
and
looked
around
to
see
where
the
second
door
was
the
painter
saw
him
do
so
and
said
it
behind
you
i
had
to
hide
it
behind
the
bed
only
then
was
able
to
see
the
little
door
in
the
wall
it
really
much
too
small
for
a
studio
here
said
the
painter
as
if
he
wanted
to
anticipate
an
objection
would
make
i
had
to
arrange
things
as
well
as
i
could
obviously
a
very
bad
place
for
the
bed
in
front
of
the
door
for
instance
when
the
judge
i
painting
at
present
comes
he
always
comes
through
the
door
by
the
bed
and
i
even
given
him
a
key
to
this
door
so
that
he
can
wait
for
me
here
in
the
studio
when
i
not
home
although
nowadays
he
usually
comes
early
in
the
morning
when
i
still
asleep
and
of
course
it
always
wakes
me
up
when
i
hear
the
door
opened
beside
the
bed
however
fast
asleep
i
am
if
you
could
hear
the
way
i
curse
him
as
he
climbs
over
my
bed
in
the
morning
you
lose
all
respect
for
judges
i
suppose
i
could
take
the
key
away
from
him
but
that
only
make
things
worse
it
only
takes
a
tiny
effort
to
break
any
of
the
doors
here
off
their
hinges
all
the
time
the
painter
was
speaking
was
considering
whether
he
should
take
off
his
coat
but
he
finally
realised
that
if
he
did
do
so
he
would
be
quite
unable
to
stay
here
any
longer
so
he
took
off
his
frock
coat
and
lay
it
on
his
knee
so
that
he
could
put
it
back
on
again
as
soon
as
the
conversation
was
over
he
had
hardly
done
this
when
one
of
the
girls
called
out
now
he
taken
his
coat
off
and
they
could
all
be
heard
pressing
around
the
gaps
in
the
planks
to
see
the
spectacle
for
themselves
the
girls
think
i
going
to
paint
your
portrait
said
the
painter
and
that
why
you
taking
your
coat
off
i
see
said
only
slightly
amused
by
this
as
he
felt
little
better
than
he
had
before
even
though
he
now
sat
in
his
shirtsleeves
with
some
irritation
he
asked
what
did
you
say
the
two
other
possibilities
were
he
had
already
forgotten
the
terms
used
apparent
acquittal
and
deferment
said
the
painter
it
up
to
you
which
one
you
choose
you
can
get
either
of
them
if
i
help
you
but
it
take
some
effort
of
course
the
difference
between
them
is
that
apparent
acquittal
needs
concentrated
effort
for
a
while
and
that
deferment
takes
much
less
effort
but
it
has
to
be
sustained
now
then
apparent
acquittal
if
that
what
you
want
i
write
down
an
assertion
of
your
innocence
on
a
piece
of
paper
the
text
for
an
assertion
of
this
sort
was
passed
down
to
me
from
my
father
and
it
quite
unassailable
i
take
this
assertion
round
to
the
judges
i
know
so
i
start
off
with
the
one
i
currently
painting
and
put
the
assertion
to
him
when
he
comes
for
his
sitting
this
evening
lay
the
assertion
in
front
of
him
explain
that
you
innocent
and
give
him
my
personal
guarantee
of
it
and
that
not
just
a
superficial
guarantee
it
a
real
one
and
it
binding
the
painter
eyes
seemed
to
show
some
reproach
of
for
wanting
to
impose
that
sort
of
responsibility
on
him
that
would
be
very
kind
of
you
said
and
would
the
judge
then
believe
you
and
nonetheless
not
pass
an
absolute
acquittal
it
like
i
just
said
answered
the
painter
and
anyway
it
not
entirely
sure
that
all
the
judges
would
believe
me
many
of
them
for
instance
might
want
me
to
bring
you
to
see
them
personally
so
then
you
have
to
come
along
too
but
at
least
then
if
that
happens
the
matter
is
half
way
won
especially
as
i
teach
you
in
advance
exactly
how
you
need
to
act
with
the
judge
concerned
of
course
what
also
happens
though
is
that
there
are
some
judges
turn
me
down
in
advance
and
that
worse
i
certainly
make
several
attempts
but
still
we
have
to
forget
about
them
but
at
least
we
can
afford
to
do
that
as
no
one
judge
can
pass
the
decisive
verdict
then
when
i
got
enough
judges
signatures
on
this
document
i
take
it
to
the
judge
who
concerned
with
your
case
i
might
even
have
his
signature
already
in
which
case
things
develop
a
bit
quicker
than
they
would
do
otherwise
but
there
are
usually
many
hold
ups
from
then
on
and
that
the
time
that
the
defendant
can
feel
most
confident
it
odd
but
true
that
people
feel
more
confidence
in
this
time
than
they
do
after
they
been
acquitted
there
no
particular
exertion
needed
now
when
he
has
the
document
asserting
the
innocence
guaranteed
by
a
number
of
other
judges
the
judge
can
acquit
you
without
any
worries
and
although
there
are
still
several
formalities
to
be
gone
through
there
no
doubt
that
that
what
do
as
a
favour
to
me
and
several
other
acquaintances
you
however
walk
out
the
court
and
you
free
so
then
i
be
free
said
hesitantly
that
right
said
the
painter
but
only
apparently
free
or
to
put
it
a
better
way
temporarily
free
as
the
most
junior
judges
the
ones
i
know
they
do
have
the
right
to
give
the
final
acquittal
only
the
highest
judge
can
do
that
in
the
court
that
quite
out
of
reach
for
you
for
me
and
for
all
of
us
we
do
know
how
things
look
there
and
incidentally
we
do
want
to
know
the
right
to
acquit
people
is
a
major
privilege
and
our
judges
do
have
it
but
they
do
have
the
right
to
free
people
from
the
indictment
that
to
say
if
freed
in
this
way
then
for
the
time
being
the
charge
is
withdrawn
but
it
still
hanging
over
their
heads
and
it
only
takes
an
order
from
higher
up
to
bring
it
back
into
force
and
as
i
in
such
good
contact
with
the
court
i
can
also
tell
you
how
the
difference
between
absolute
and
apparent
acquittal
is
described
just
in
a
superficial
way
in
the
directives
to
the
court
offices
if
there
an
absolute
acquittal
all
proceedings
should
stop
everything
disappears
from
the
process
not
just
the
indictment
but
the
trial
and
even
the
acquittal
disappears
everything
just
disappears
with
an
apparent
acquittal
it
different
when
that
happens
nothing
has
changed
except
that
the
case
for
your
innocence
for
your
acquittal
and
the
grounds
for
the
acquittal
have
been
made
stronger
apart
from
that
proceedings
go
on
as
before
the
court
offices
continue
their
business
and
the
case
gets
passed
to
higher
courts
gets
passed
back
down
to
the
lower
courts
and
so
on
backwards
and
forwards
sometimes
faster
sometimes
slower
to
and
fro
impossible
to
know
exactly
what
happening
while
this
is
going
on
seen
from
outside
it
can
sometimes
seem
that
everything
has
been
long
since
forgotten
the
documents
have
been
lost
and
the
acquittal
is
complete
familiar
with
the
court
would
believe
it
no
documents
ever
get
lost
the
court
forgets
nothing
one
day
expects
it
some
judge
or
other
picks
up
the
documents
and
looks
more
closely
at
them
he
notices
that
this
particular
case
is
still
active
and
orders
the
defendant
immediate
arrest
i
been
talking
here
as
if
there
a
long
delay
between
apparent
acquittal
and
that
is
quite
possible
and
i
do
know
of
cases
like
that
but
it
just
as
likely
that
the
defendant
goes
home
after
he
been
acquitted
and
finds
somebody
there
waiting
to
him
then
of
course
his
life
as
a
free
man
is
at
an
end
and
does
the
trial
start
over
again
asked
finding
it
hard
to
believe
the
trial
will
always
start
over
again
said
the
painter
but
there
is
once
again
as
before
the
possibility
of
getting
an
apparent
acquittal
once
again
the
accused
has
to
muster
all
his
strength
and
must
give
up
the
painter
said
that
last
phrase
possibly
as
a
result
of
the
impression
that
whose
shoulders
had
dropped
somewhat
gave
on
him
but
to
get
a
second
acquittal
asked
as
if
in
anticipation
of
further
revelations
by
the
painter
is
that
not
harder
to
get
than
the
first
time
as
far
as
that
concerned
answered
the
painter
there
nothing
you
can
say
for
certain
you
mean
do
you
that
the
second
arrest
would
have
an
adverse
influence
on
the
judge
and
the
verdict
he
passes
on
the
defendant
that
not
how
it
happens
when
the
acquittal
is
passed
the
judges
are
already
aware
that
is
likely
so
when
it
happens
it
has
hardly
any
effect
but
there
are
countless
other
reasons
why
the
judges
mood
and
their
legal
acumen
in
the
case
can
be
altered
and
efforts
to
obtain
the
second
acquittal
must
therefore
be
suited
to
the
new
conditions
and
generally
just
as
vigorous
as
the
first
but
this
second
acquittal
will
once
again
not
be
final
said
shaking
his
head
of
course
not
said
the
painter
the
second
acquittal
is
followed
by
the
third
arrest
the
third
acquittal
by
the
fourth
arrest
and
so
on
that
what
is
meant
by
the
term
apparent
acquittal
was
silent
you
clearly
do
think
an
apparent
acquittal
offers
much
advantage
said
the
painter
perhaps
deferment
would
suit
you
better
would
you
like
me
to
explain
what
deferment
is
about
nodded
the
painter
had
leant
back
and
spread
himself
out
in
his
chair
his
nightshirt
was
wide
open
he
had
pushed
his
hand
inside
and
was
stroking
his
breast
and
his
sides
deferment
said
the
painter
looking
vaguely
in
front
of
himself
for
a
while
as
if
trying
to
find
a
perfectly
appropriate
explanation
deferment
consists
of
keeping
proceedings
permanently
in
their
earliest
stages
to
do
that
the
accused
and
those
helping
him
need
to
keep
in
continuous
personal
contact
with
the
court
especially
those
helping
him
i
repeat
this
does
require
so
much
effort
as
getting
an
apparent
acquittal
but
it
probably
requires
a
lot
more
attention
you
must
never
let
the
trial
out
of
your
sight
you
have
to
go
and
see
the
appropriate
judge
at
regular
intervals
as
well
as
when
something
in
particular
comes
up
and
whatever
you
do
you
have
to
try
and
remain
friendly
with
him
if
you
do
know
the
judge
personally
you
have
to
influence
him
through
the
judges
you
do
know
and
you
have
to
do
it
without
giving
up
on
the
direct
discussions
as
long
as
you
do
fail
to
do
any
of
these
things
you
can
be
reasonably
sure
the
trial
wo
get
past
its
first
stages
the
trial
does
stop
but
the
defendant
is
almost
as
certain
of
avoiding
conviction
as
if
he
been
acquitted
compared
with
an
apparent
acquittal
deferment
has
the
advantage
that
the
defendant
future
is
less
uncertain
he
safe
from
the
shock
of
being
suddenly
and
does
need
to
fear
the
exertions
and
stress
involved
in
getting
an
apparent
acquittal
just
when
everything
else
in
his
life
would
make
it
most
difficult
deferment
does
have
certain
disadvantages
of
its
own
though
too
and
they
should
be
i
do
mean
by
this
that
the
defendant
is
never
free
he
never
free
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
with
an
apparent
acquittal
either
there
another
disadvantage
proceedings
ca
be
prevented
from
moving
forward
unless
there
are
some
at
least
ostensible
reasons
given
so
something
needs
to
seem
to
be
happening
when
looked
at
from
the
outside
this
means
that
from
time
to
time
various
injunctions
have
to
be
obeyed
the
accused
has
to
be
questioned
investigations
have
to
take
place
and
so
on
the
trial
been
artificially
constrained
inside
a
tiny
circle
and
it
has
to
be
continuously
spun
round
within
it
and
that
of
course
brings
with
it
certain
unpleasantnesses
for
the
accused
although
you
should
imagine
they
all
that
bad
all
of
this
is
just
for
show
the
interrogations
for
instance
they
only
very
short
if
you
ever
do
have
the
time
or
do
feel
like
going
to
them
you
can
offer
an
excuse
with
some
judges
you
can
even
arrange
the
injunctions
together
a
long
time
in
advance
in
essence
all
it
means
is
that
as
the
accused
you
have
to
report
to
the
judge
from
time
to
time
even
while
the
painter
was
speaking
those
last
words
had
laid
his
coat
over
his
arm
and
had
stood
up
immediately
from
outside
the
door
there
was
a
cry
of
standing
up
now
are
you
leaving
already
asked
the
painter
who
had
also
stood
up
it
must
be
the
air
that
driving
you
out
very
sorry
about
that
there
still
a
lot
i
need
to
tell
you
i
had
to
put
everything
very
briefly
but
i
hope
at
least
it
was
all
clear
oh
yes
said
whose
head
was
aching
from
the
effort
of
listening
despite
this
affirmation
the
painter
summed
it
all
up
once
more
as
if
he
wanted
to
give
something
to
console
him
on
his
way
home
both
have
in
common
that
they
prevent
the
defendant
being
convicted
he
said
but
they
also
prevent
his
being
properly
acquitted
said
quietly
as
if
ashamed
to
acknowledge
it
you
got
it
in
essence
said
the
painter
quickly
placed
his
hand
on
his
winter
overcoat
but
could
not
bring
himself
to
put
it
on
most
of
all
he
would
have
liked
to
pack
everything
together
and
run
out
to
the
fresh
air
not
even
the
girls
could
induce
him
to
put
his
coat
on
even
though
they
were
already
loudly
telling
each
other
that
he
was
doing
so
the
painter
still
had
to
interpret
mood
in
some
way
so
he
said
i
expect
deliberately
avoided
deciding
between
my
suggestions
yet
that
good
i
would
even
have
advised
against
making
a
decision
straight
away
there
no
more
than
a
hair
breadth
of
difference
between
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
everything
has
to
be
carefully
weighed
up
but
the
most
important
thing
is
you
should
lose
too
much
time
i
come
back
here
again
soon
said
who
had
suddenly
decided
to
put
his
frock
coat
on
threw
his
overcoat
over
his
shoulder
and
hurried
over
to
the
door
behind
which
the
girls
now
began
to
scream
thought
he
could
even
see
the
screaming
girls
through
the
door
well
have
to
keep
your
word
said
the
painter
who
had
not
followed
him
otherwise
i
come
to
the
bank
to
ask
about
it
myself
will
you
open
this
door
for
me
said
pulling
at
the
handle
which
as
he
noticed
from
the
resistance
was
being
held
tightly
by
the
girls
on
the
other
side
do
you
want
to
be
bothered
by
the
girls
asked
the
painter
it
better
if
you
use
the
other
way
out
he
said
pointing
to
the
door
behind
the
bed
agreed
to
this
and
jumped
back
to
the
bed
but
instead
of
opening
that
door
the
painter
crawled
under
the
bed
and
from
underneath
it
asked
just
a
moment
more
would
you
not
like
to
see
a
picture
i
could
sell
to
you
did
not
want
to
be
impolite
the
painter
really
had
taken
his
side
and
promised
to
help
him
more
in
the
future
and
because
of
forgetfulness
there
had
been
no
mention
of
any
payment
for
the
painter
help
so
could
not
turn
him
down
now
and
allowed
him
to
show
him
the
picture
even
though
he
was
quivering
with
impatience
to
get
out
of
the
studio
from
under
the
bed
the
painter
withdrew
a
pile
of
unframed
paintings
they
were
so
covered
in
dust
that
when
the
painter
tried
to
blow
it
off
the
one
on
top
the
dust
swirled
around
in
front
of
eyes
robbing
him
of
breath
for
some
time
moorland
landscape
said
the
painter
passing
the
picture
to
it
showed
two
sickly
trees
well
separated
from
each
other
in
dark
grass
in
the
background
there
was
a
sunset
nice
said
i
buy
it
expressed
himself
in
this
curt
way
without
any
thought
so
he
was
glad
when
the
painter
did
not
take
this
amiss
and
picked
up
a
second
painting
from
the
floor
this
is
a
counterpart
to
the
first
picture
said
the
painter
perhaps
it
had
been
intended
as
a
counterpart
but
there
was
not
the
slightest
difference
to
be
seen
between
it
and
the
first
picture
there
were
the
trees
there
the
grass
and
there
the
sunset
but
this
was
of
little
importance
to
they
are
beautiful
landscapes
he
said
i
buy
them
both
and
hang
them
in
my
office
you
seem
to
like
this
subject
said
the
painter
picking
up
a
third
painting
good
job
i
still
got
another
similar
picture
here
the
picture
though
was
not
similar
rather
it
was
exactly
the
same
moorland
landscape
the
painter
was
fully
exploiting
this
opportunity
to
sell
off
his
old
pictures
take
this
one
too
said
how
much
do
the
three
paintings
cost
we
can
talk
about
that
next
time
said
the
painter
you
in
a
hurry
now
and
we
still
be
in
contact
and
besides
i
glad
you
like
the
paintings
i
give
you
all
the
paintings
i
got
down
here
they
all
moorland
landscapes
i
painted
a
lot
of
moorland
landscapes
a
lot
of
people
do
like
that
sort
of
picture
because
they
too
gloomy
but
there
are
others
and
you
one
of
them
who
love
gloomy
themes
but
was
not
in
the
mood
to
hear
about
the
professional
experiences
of
this
painter
cum
beggar
wrap
them
all
up
he
called
out
interrupting
the
painter
as
he
was
speaking
my
servant
will
come
to
fetch
them
in
the
morning
there
no
need
for
that
said
the
painter
i
expect
i
can
find
a
porter
for
you
who
can
go
with
you
now
and
at
last
he
leant
over
the
bed
and
unlocked
the
door
just
step
on
the
bed
do
worry
about
that
said
the
painter
that
what
everyone
does
who
comes
in
here
even
without
this
invitation
had
shown
no
compunction
in
already
placing
his
foot
in
the
middle
of
the
bed
covers
then
he
looked
out
through
the
open
door
and
drew
his
foot
back
again
what
is
that
he
asked
the
painter
what
are
you
so
surprised
at
he
asked
surprised
in
his
turn
those
are
court
offices
did
you
know
there
are
court
offices
here
there
are
court
offices
in
almost
every
attic
why
should
this
building
be
any
different
even
my
studio
is
actually
one
of
the
court
offices
but
the
court
put
it
at
my
disposal
it
was
not
so
much
finding
court
offices
even
here
that
shocked
he
was
mainly
shocked
at
himself
at
his
own
na√Øvety
in
court
matters
it
seemed
to
him
that
one
of
the
most
basic
rules
governing
how
a
defendant
should
behave
was
always
to
be
prepared
never
allow
surprises
never
to
look
unsuspecting
to
the
right
when
the
judge
stood
beside
him
to
his
left
and
this
was
the
very
basic
rule
that
he
was
continually
violating
a
long
corridor
extended
in
from
of
him
air
blew
in
from
it
which
compared
with
the
air
in
the
studio
was
refreshing
there
were
benches
set
along
each
side
of
the
corridor
just
as
in
the
waiting
area
for
the
office
he
went
to
himself
there
seemed
to
be
precise
rules
governing
how
offices
should
be
equipped
there
did
not
seem
to
be
many
people
visiting
the
offices
that
day
there
was
a
man
there
half
sitting
half
laying
his
face
was
buried
in
his
arm
on
the
bench
and
he
seemed
to
be
sleeping
another
man
was
standing
in
the
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
now
climbed
over
the
bed
the
painter
followed
him
with
the
pictures
they
soon
came
across
a
servant
of
the
court
was
now
able
to
recognise
all
the
servants
of
the
court
from
the
gold
buttons
they
wore
on
their
civilian
clothes
below
the
normal
buttons
and
the
painter
instructed
him
to
go
with
carrying
the
pictures
staggered
more
than
he
walked
his
handkerchief
pressed
over
his
mouth
they
had
nearly
reached
the
exit
when
the
girls
stormed
in
on
them
so
had
not
been
able
to
avoid
them
they
had
clearly
seen
that
the
second
door
of
the
studio
had
been
opened
and
had
gone
around
to
impose
themselves
on
him
from
this
side
i
ca
come
with
you
any
further
called
out
the
painter
with
a
laugh
as
the
girls
pressed
in
goodbye
and
hesitate
too
long
did
not
even
look
round
at
him
once
on
the
street
he
took
the
first
cab
he
came
across
he
now
had
to
get
rid
of
the
servant
whose
gold
button
continually
caught
his
eye
even
if
it
caught
else
as
a
servant
the
servant
of
the
court
was
going
to
sit
on
the
but
chased
him
down
from
there
it
was
already
well
into
the
afternoon
when
arrived
in
front
of
the
bank
he
would
have
liked
to
leave
the
pictures
in
the
cab
but
feared
there
might
be
some
occasion
when
he
would
have
to
let
the
painter
see
he
still
had
them
so
he
had
the
pictures
taken
to
his
office
and
locked
them
in
the
lowest
drawer
of
his
desk
so
that
he
could
at
least
keep
them
safe
from
the
deputy
director
view
for
the
next
few
days
chapter
eight
block
the
businessman
dismissing
the
lawyer
had
at
last
made
the
decision
to
withdraw
his
defence
from
the
lawyer
it
was
impossible
to
remove
his
doubts
as
to
whether
this
was
the
right
decision
but
this
was
outweighed
by
his
belief
in
its
necessity
this
decision
on
the
day
he
intended
to
go
to
see
the
lawyer
took
a
lot
of
the
strength
he
needed
for
his
work
he
worked
exceptionally
slowly
he
had
to
remain
in
his
office
a
long
time
and
it
was
already
past
ten
when
he
finally
stood
in
front
of
the
lawyer
front
door
even
before
he
rang
he
considered
whether
it
might
not
be
better
to
give
the
lawyer
notice
by
letter
or
telephone
a
personal
conversation
would
certainly
be
very
difficult
nonetheless
did
not
actually
want
to
do
without
it
if
he
gave
notice
by
any
other
means
it
would
be
received
in
silence
or
with
a
few
formulated
words
and
unless
leni
could
discover
anything
would
never
learn
how
the
lawyer
had
taken
his
dismissal
and
what
its
consequences
might
be
in
the
lawyer
not
unimportant
opinion
but
sitting
in
front
of
him
and
taken
by
surprise
by
his
dismissal
would
be
able
easily
to
infer
everything
he
wanted
from
the
lawyer
face
and
behaviour
even
if
he
could
not
be
induced
to
say
very
much
it
was
not
even
out
of
the
question
that
might
after
all
be
persuaded
that
it
would
be
best
to
leave
his
defence
to
the
lawyer
and
withdraw
his
dismissal
as
usual
there
was
at
first
no
response
to
ring
at
the
door
leni
could
be
a
bit
quicker
thought
but
he
could
at
least
be
glad
there
was
nobody
else
interfering
as
usually
happened
be
it
the
man
in
his
nightshirt
or
anyone
else
who
might
bother
him
as
pressed
on
the
button
for
the
second
time
he
looked
back
at
the
other
door
but
this
time
it
too
remained
closed
at
last
two
eyes
appeared
at
the
in
the
lawyer
door
although
they
were
leni
eyes
someone
unlocked
the
door
but
kept
himself
pressed
against
it
as
he
called
back
inside
it
him
and
only
then
did
he
open
the
door
properly
pushed
against
the
door
as
behind
him
he
could
already
hear
the
key
being
hurriedly
turned
in
the
lock
of
the
door
to
the
other
flat
when
the
door
in
front
of
him
finally
opened
he
stormed
straight
into
the
hallway
through
the
corridor
which
led
between
the
rooms
he
saw
leni
to
whom
the
warning
cry
of
the
door
opener
had
been
directed
still
running
away
in
her
nightshirt
he
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
and
then
looked
round
at
the
person
who
had
opened
the
door
it
was
a
small
wizened
man
with
a
full
beard
he
held
a
candle
in
his
hand
do
you
work
here
asked
no
answered
the
man
i
do
belong
here
at
all
the
lawyer
is
only
representing
me
i
here
on
legal
business
without
your
coat
asked
indicating
the
man
deficiency
of
dress
with
a
gesture
of
his
hand
oh
do
forgive
me
said
the
man
and
he
looked
at
himself
in
the
light
of
the
candle
he
was
holding
as
if
he
had
not
known
about
his
appearance
until
then
is
leni
your
lover
asked
curtly
he
had
set
his
legs
slightly
apart
his
hands
in
which
he
held
his
hat
were
behind
his
back
merely
by
being
in
possession
of
a
thick
overcoat
he
felt
his
advantage
over
this
thin
little
man
oh
god
he
said
and
shocked
raised
one
hand
in
front
of
his
face
as
if
in
defence
no
no
what
can
you
be
thinking
you
look
honest
enough
said
with
a
smile
but
come
along
anyway
indicated
with
his
hat
which
way
the
man
was
to
go
and
let
him
go
ahead
of
him
what
is
your
name
then
asked
on
the
way
block
i
a
businessman
said
the
small
man
twisting
himself
round
as
he
thus
introduced
himself
although
did
not
allow
him
to
stop
moving
is
that
your
real
name
asked
of
course
it
is
was
the
man
reply
why
do
you
doubt
it
i
thought
you
might
have
some
reason
to
keep
your
name
secret
said
he
felt
himself
as
much
at
liberty
as
is
normally
only
felt
in
foreign
parts
when
speaking
with
people
of
lower
standing
keeping
everything
about
himself
to
himself
speaking
only
casually
about
the
interests
of
the
other
able
to
raise
him
to
a
level
above
one
own
but
also
able
at
will
to
let
him
drop
again
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
lawyer
office
opened
it
and
to
the
businessman
who
had
obediently
gone
ahead
called
not
so
fast
bring
some
light
here
thought
leni
might
have
hidden
in
here
he
let
the
businessman
search
in
every
corner
but
the
room
was
empty
in
front
of
the
picture
of
the
judge
took
hold
of
the
braces
to
stop
him
moving
on
do
you
know
him
he
asked
pointing
upwards
with
his
finger
the
businessman
lifted
the
candle
blinked
as
he
looked
up
and
said
it
a
judge
an
important
judge
asked
and
stood
to
the
side
and
in
front
of
the
businessman
so
that
he
could
observe
what
impression
the
picture
had
on
him
the
businessman
was
looking
up
in
admiration
he
an
important
judge
you
do
have
much
insight
said
he
is
the
lowest
of
the
lowest
examining
judges
i
remember
now
said
the
businessman
as
he
lowered
the
candle
that
what
i
already
been
told
well
of
course
you
have
called
out
i
forgotten
about
it
of
course
you
would
already
have
been
told
but
why
why
asked
the
businessman
as
he
moved
forwards
towards
the
door
propelled
by
the
hands
of
outside
in
the
corridor
said
you
know
where
leni
hidden
do
you
hidden
said
the
businessman
no
but
she
might
be
in
the
kitchen
cooking
soup
for
the
lawyer
why
did
you
say
that
immediately
asked
i
was
going
to
take
you
there
but
you
called
me
back
again
answered
the
businessman
as
if
confused
by
the
contradictory
commands
you
think
you
very
clever
do
you
said
k
now
take
me
there
had
never
been
in
the
kitchen
it
was
surprisingly
big
and
very
well
equipped
the
stove
alone
was
three
times
bigger
than
normal
stoves
but
it
was
not
possible
to
see
any
detail
beyond
this
as
the
kitchen
was
at
the
time
illuminated
by
no
more
than
a
small
lamp
hanging
by
the
entrance
at
the
stove
stood
leni
in
a
white
apron
as
always
breaking
eggs
into
a
pot
standing
on
a
spirit
lamp
good
evening
josef
she
said
with
a
glance
sideways
good
evening
said
pointing
with
one
hand
to
a
chair
in
a
corner
which
the
businessman
was
to
sit
on
and
he
did
indeed
sit
down
on
it
however
went
very
close
behind
leni
back
leant
over
her
shoulder
and
asked
who
is
this
man
leni
put
one
hand
around
as
she
stirred
the
soup
with
the
other
she
drew
him
forward
toward
herself
and
said
he
a
pitiful
character
a
poor
businessman
by
the
name
of
block
just
look
at
him
the
two
of
them
looked
back
over
their
shoulders
the
businessman
was
sitting
on
the
chair
that
had
directed
him
to
he
had
extinguished
the
candle
whose
light
was
no
longer
needed
and
pressed
on
the
wick
with
his
fingers
to
stop
the
smoke
you
were
in
your
nightshirt
said
putting
his
hand
on
her
head
and
turning
it
back
towards
the
stove
she
was
silent
is
he
your
lover
asked
she
was
about
to
take
hold
of
the
pot
of
soup
but
took
both
her
hands
and
said
answer
me
she
said
come
into
the
office
i
explain
everything
to
you
no
said
i
want
you
to
explain
it
here
she
put
her
arms
around
him
and
wanted
to
kiss
him
though
pushed
her
away
and
said
i
do
want
you
to
kiss
me
now
josef
said
leni
looking
at
imploringly
but
frankly
in
the
eyes
you
not
going
to
be
jealous
of
block
now
are
you
rudi
she
then
said
turning
to
the
businessman
help
me
out
will
you
i
being
suspected
of
something
you
can
see
that
leave
the
candle
alone
it
had
looked
as
though
block
had
not
been
paying
attention
but
he
had
been
following
closely
i
do
even
know
why
you
might
be
jealous
he
said
ingenuously
nor
do
i
actually
said
looking
at
the
businessman
with
a
smile
leni
laughed
out
loud
and
while
was
not
paying
attention
took
the
opportunity
of
embracing
him
and
whispering
leave
him
alone
now
you
can
see
what
sort
of
person
he
is
i
been
helping
him
a
little
bit
because
he
an
important
client
of
the
lawyer
and
no
other
reason
and
what
about
you
do
you
want
to
speak
to
the
lawyer
at
this
time
of
day
he
very
unwell
today
but
if
you
want
i
tell
him
you
here
but
you
can
certainly
spend
the
night
with
me
it
so
long
since
you
were
last
here
even
the
lawyer
has
been
asking
about
you
do
neglect
your
case
and
i
got
some
things
to
tell
you
that
i
learned
about
but
now
before
anything
else
take
your
coat
off
she
helped
him
off
with
his
coat
took
the
hat
off
his
head
ran
with
the
things
into
the
hallway
to
hang
them
up
then
she
ran
back
and
saw
to
the
soup
do
you
want
me
to
tell
him
you
here
straight
away
or
take
him
his
soup
first
tell
him
here
first
said
he
was
in
a
bad
mood
he
had
originally
intended
a
detailed
discussion
of
his
business
with
leni
especially
the
question
of
his
giving
the
lawyer
notice
but
now
he
no
longer
wanted
to
because
of
the
presence
of
the
businessman
now
he
considered
his
affair
too
important
to
let
this
little
businessman
take
part
in
it
and
perhaps
change
some
of
his
decisions
and
so
he
called
leni
back
even
though
she
was
already
on
her
way
to
the
lawyer
bring
him
his
soup
first
he
said
i
want
him
to
get
his
strength
up
for
the
discussion
with
me
he
need
it
you
a
client
of
the
lawyer
too
are
you
said
the
businessman
quietly
from
his
corner
as
if
he
were
trying
to
find
this
out
it
was
not
however
taken
well
what
business
is
that
of
yours
said
and
leni
said
will
you
be
quiet
i
take
him
his
soup
first
then
shall
i
and
she
poured
the
soup
into
a
dish
the
only
worry
then
is
that
he
might
go
to
sleep
soon
after
he
eaten
what
i
got
to
say
to
him
will
keep
him
awake
said
who
still
wanted
to
intimate
that
he
intended
some
important
negotiations
with
the
lawyer
he
wanted
leni
to
ask
him
what
it
was
and
only
then
to
ask
her
advice
but
instead
she
just
promptly
carried
out
the
order
he
had
given
her
when
she
went
over
to
him
with
the
dish
she
deliberately
brushed
against
him
and
whispered
i
tell
him
you
here
as
soon
as
he
eaten
the
soup
so
that
i
can
get
you
back
as
soon
as
possible
just
go
said
just
go
be
a
bit
more
friendly
she
said
and
still
holding
the
dish
turned
completely
round
once
more
in
the
doorway
watched
her
as
she
went
the
decision
had
finally
been
made
that
the
lawyer
was
to
be
dismissed
it
was
probably
better
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
discuss
the
matter
any
more
with
leni
beforehand
she
hardly
understood
the
complexity
of
the
matter
she
would
certainly
have
advised
him
against
it
and
perhaps
would
even
have
prevented
him
from
dismissing
the
lawyer
this
time
he
would
have
remained
in
doubt
and
unease
and
eventually
have
carried
out
his
decision
after
a
while
anyway
as
this
decision
was
something
he
could
not
avoid
the
sooner
it
was
carried
out
the
more
harm
would
be
avoided
and
moreover
perhaps
the
businessman
had
something
to
say
on
the
matter
turned
round
the
businessman
hardly
noticed
it
as
he
was
about
to
stand
up
stay
where
you
are
said
and
pulled
up
a
chair
beside
him
have
you
been
a
client
of
the
lawyer
for
a
long
time
asked
yes
said
the
businessman
a
very
long
time
how
many
years
has
he
been
representing
you
so
far
then
asked
i
do
know
how
you
mean
said
the
businessman
he
been
my
business
lawyer
i
buy
and
sell
cereals
he
been
my
business
lawyer
since
i
took
the
business
over
and
that
about
twenty
years
now
but
perhaps
you
mean
my
own
trial
and
he
been
representing
me
in
that
since
it
started
and
been
more
than
five
years
yes
well
over
five
years
he
then
added
pulling
out
an
old
briefcase
i
got
everything
written
down
i
can
tell
you
the
exact
dates
if
you
like
it
so
hard
to
remember
everything
probably
my
trial
been
going
on
much
longer
than
that
it
started
soon
after
the
death
of
my
wife
and
that
been
more
than
five
and
a
half
years
now
moved
in
closer
to
him
so
the
lawyer
takes
on
ordinary
legal
business
does
he
he
asked
this
combination
of
criminal
and
commercial
business
seemed
surprisingly
reassuring
for
oh
yes
said
the
businessman
and
then
he
whispered
they
even
say
he
more
efficient
in
jurisprudence
than
he
is
in
other
matters
but
then
he
seemed
to
regret
saying
this
and
he
laid
a
hand
on
shoulder
and
said
please
do
betray
me
to
him
will
you
patted
his
thigh
to
reassure
him
and
said
no
i
do
betray
people
he
can
be
so
vindictive
you
see
said
the
businessman
i
sure
he
wo
do
anything
against
such
a
faithful
client
as
you
said
oh
he
might
do
said
the
businessman
when
he
gets
cross
it
does
matter
who
it
is
and
anyway
i
not
really
faithful
to
him
how
that
then
asked
i
not
sure
i
should
tell
you
about
it
said
the
businessman
hesitantly
i
think
it
be
alright
said
well
then
said
the
businessman
i
tell
you
about
some
of
it
but
you
have
to
tell
me
a
secret
too
then
we
can
support
each
other
with
the
lawyer
you
are
very
careful
said
but
i
tell
you
a
secret
that
will
set
your
mind
completely
at
ease
now
tell
me
in
what
way
have
you
been
unfaithful
to
the
lawyer
i
said
the
businessman
hesitantly
and
in
a
tone
as
if
he
were
confessing
something
dishonourable
i
taken
on
other
lawyers
besides
him
that
not
so
serious
said
a
little
disappointed
it
is
here
said
the
businessman
who
had
had
some
difficulty
breathing
since
making
his
confession
but
who
now
after
hearing
comment
began
to
feel
more
trust
for
him
that
not
allowed
and
it
allowed
least
of
all
to
take
on
petty
lawyers
when
you
already
got
a
proper
one
and
just
what
i
have
done
besides
him
i
got
five
petty
lawyers
five
exclaimed
astonished
at
this
number
five
lawyers
besides
this
one
the
businessman
nodded
i
even
negotiating
with
a
sixth
one
but
why
do
you
need
so
many
lawyers
asked
i
need
all
of
them
said
the
businessman
would
you
mind
explaining
that
to
me
asked
i
be
glad
to
said
the
businessman
most
of
all
i
want
to
lose
my
case
well
that
obvious
so
that
means
i
neglect
anything
that
might
be
of
use
to
me
even
if
there
very
little
hope
of
a
particular
thing
being
of
any
use
i
ca
just
throw
it
away
so
everything
i
have
i
put
to
use
in
my
case
i
taken
all
the
money
out
of
my
business
for
example
the
offices
for
my
business
used
to
occupy
nearly
a
whole
floor
but
now
all
i
need
is
a
little
room
at
the
back
where
i
work
with
one
apprentice
it
was
just
using
up
the
money
that
caused
the
difficulty
of
course
it
was
much
more
to
do
with
me
not
working
at
the
business
as
much
as
i
used
to
if
you
want
to
do
something
about
your
trial
you
do
have
much
time
for
anything
else
so
you
also
working
at
the
court
yourself
asked
that
just
what
i
want
to
learn
more
about
i
ca
tell
you
very
much
about
that
said
the
businessman
at
first
i
tried
to
do
that
too
but
i
soon
had
to
give
it
up
again
it
wears
you
out
too
much
and
it
really
not
much
use
and
it
turned
out
to
be
quite
impossible
to
work
there
yourself
and
to
negotiate
at
least
for
me
it
was
it
a
heavy
strain
there
just
sitting
and
waiting
you
know
yourself
what
the
air
is
like
in
those
offices
how
do
you
know
i
been
there
then
asked
i
was
in
the
waiting
room
myself
when
you
went
through
what
a
coincidence
that
is
exclaimed
totally
engrossed
and
forgetting
how
ridiculous
the
businessman
had
seemed
to
him
earlier
so
you
saw
me
you
were
in
the
waiting
room
when
i
went
through
yes
i
did
go
through
it
one
time
it
is
such
a
big
coincidence
said
the
businessman
i
there
nearly
every
day
i
expect
i
have
to
go
there
quite
often
myself
now
said
although
i
can
hardly
expect
to
be
shown
the
same
respect
as
i
was
then
they
all
stood
up
for
me
they
must
have
thought
i
was
a
judge
no
said
the
businessman
we
were
greeting
the
servant
of
the
court
we
knew
you
were
a
defendant
that
sort
of
news
spreads
very
quickly
so
you
already
knew
about
that
said
the
way
i
behaved
must
have
seemed
very
arrogant
to
you
did
you
criticise
me
for
it
afterwards
no
said
the
businessman
quite
the
opposite
that
was
just
stupidity
what
do
you
mean
asked
why
are
you
asking
about
it
said
the
businessman
in
some
irritation
you
still
do
seem
to
know
the
people
there
and
you
might
take
it
wrong
do
forget
in
proceedings
like
this
there
are
always
lots
of
different
things
coming
up
to
talk
about
things
that
you
just
ca
understand
with
reason
alone
you
just
get
too
tired
and
distracted
for
most
things
and
so
instead
people
rely
on
superstition
i
talking
about
the
others
but
i
no
better
myself
one
of
these
superstitions
for
example
is
that
you
can
learn
a
lot
about
the
outcome
of
a
defendant
case
by
looking
at
his
face
especially
the
shape
of
his
lips
there
are
lots
who
believe
that
and
they
said
they
could
see
from
the
shape
of
your
lips
that
definitely
be
found
guilty
very
soon
i
repeat
that
all
this
is
just
a
ridiculous
superstition
and
in
most
cases
it
completely
disproved
by
the
facts
but
when
you
live
in
that
society
it
hard
to
hold
yourself
back
from
beliefs
like
that
just
think
how
much
effect
that
superstition
can
have
you
spoke
to
one
of
them
there
did
you
he
was
hardly
able
to
give
you
an
answer
there
are
lots
of
things
there
that
can
make
you
confused
of
course
but
one
of
them
for
him
was
the
appearance
of
your
lips
he
told
us
all
later
he
thought
he
could
see
something
in
your
lips
that
meant
he
be
convicted
himself
on
my
lips
asked
pulling
out
a
pocket
mirror
and
examining
himself
i
can
see
nothing
special
about
my
lips
can
you
nor
can
i
said
the
businessman
nothing
at
all
these
people
are
so
superstitious
exclaimed
is
that
what
i
just
told
you
asked
the
businessman
do
you
then
have
that
much
contact
with
each
other
exchanging
each
other
opinions
said
i
kept
myself
completely
apart
so
far
they
do
normally
have
much
contact
with
each
other
said
the
businessman
that
would
be
impossible
there
are
so
many
of
them
and
they
do
have
much
in
common
either
if
a
group
of
them
ever
thinks
they
have
found
something
in
common
it
soon
turns
out
they
were
mistaken
there
nothing
you
can
do
as
a
group
where
the
concerned
each
case
is
examined
separately
the
court
is
very
painstaking
so
there
nothing
to
be
achieved
by
forming
into
a
group
only
sometimes
an
individual
will
achieve
something
in
secret
and
only
when
that
been
done
the
others
learn
about
it
nobody
knows
how
it
was
done
so
there
no
sense
of
togetherness
you
meet
people
now
and
then
in
the
waiting
rooms
but
we
do
talk
much
there
the
superstitious
beliefs
were
established
a
long
time
ago
and
they
spread
all
by
themselves
i
saw
those
gentlemen
in
the
waiting
room
said
it
seemed
so
pointless
for
them
to
be
waiting
in
that
way
waiting
is
not
pointless
said
the
businessman
it
only
pointless
if
you
try
and
interfere
yourself
i
told
you
just
now
i
got
five
lawyers
besides
this
one
you
might
think
i
thought
it
myself
at
first
you
might
think
i
could
leave
the
whole
thing
entirely
up
to
them
now
that
would
be
entirely
wrong
i
can
leave
it
up
to
them
less
than
when
i
had
just
the
one
maybe
you
do
understand
that
do
you
no
said
and
to
slow
the
businessman
down
who
had
been
speaking
too
fast
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
businessman
to
reassure
him
but
i
like
just
to
ask
you
to
speak
a
little
more
slowly
these
are
many
very
important
things
for
me
and
i
ca
follow
exactly
what
saying
you
quite
right
to
remind
me
of
that
said
the
businessman
you
new
to
all
this
a
junior
your
trial
is
six
months
old
is
it
yes
i
heard
about
it
such
a
new
case
but
i
already
thought
all
these
things
through
countless
times
to
me
they
the
most
obvious
things
in
the
world
you
must
be
glad
your
trial
has
already
progressed
so
far
are
you
asked
he
did
not
wish
to
ask
directly
how
the
businessman
affairs
stood
but
received
no
clear
answer
anyway
yes
i
been
working
at
my
trial
for
five
years
now
said
the
businessman
as
his
head
sank
that
no
small
achievement
then
he
was
silent
for
a
while
listened
to
hear
whether
leni
was
on
her
way
back
on
the
one
hand
he
did
not
want
her
to
come
back
too
soon
as
he
still
had
many
questions
to
ask
and
did
not
want
her
to
find
him
in
this
intimate
discussion
with
the
businessman
but
on
the
other
hand
it
irritated
him
that
she
stayed
so
long
with
the
lawyer
when
was
there
much
longer
than
she
needed
to
give
him
his
soup
i
still
remember
it
exactly
the
businessman
began
again
and
immediately
gave
him
his
full
attention
when
my
case
was
as
old
as
yours
is
now
i
only
had
this
one
lawyer
at
that
time
but
i
was
very
satisfied
with
him
now
i
find
out
everything
thought
nodding
vigorously
as
if
he
could
thereby
encourage
the
businessman
to
say
everything
worth
knowing
my
case
the
businessman
continued
move
on
at
all
there
were
some
hearings
that
took
place
and
i
went
to
every
one
of
them
collected
materials
handed
all
my
business
books
to
the
court
which
i
later
found
was
entirely
unnecessary
i
ran
back
and
forth
to
the
lawyer
and
he
submitted
various
documents
to
the
court
too
various
documents
asked
yes
that
right
said
the
businessman
that
very
important
for
me
said
in
my
case
still
working
on
the
first
set
of
documents
he
still
has
done
anything
i
see
now
that
he
been
neglecting
me
quite
disgracefully
there
can
be
lots
of
good
reasons
why
the
first
documents
still
ready
said
the
businessman
and
anyway
it
turned
out
later
on
that
the
ones
he
submitted
for
me
were
entirely
worthless
i
even
read
one
of
them
myself
one
of
the
officials
at
the
court
was
very
helpful
it
was
very
learned
but
it
did
actually
say
anything
most
of
all
there
was
lots
of
latin
which
i
ca
understand
then
pages
and
pages
of
general
appeals
to
the
court
then
lots
of
flattery
for
particular
officials
they
were
named
these
officials
but
anyone
familiar
with
the
court
must
have
been
able
to
guess
who
they
were
then
there
was
by
the
lawyer
where
he
humiliated
himself
to
the
court
in
a
way
that
was
downright
and
then
endless
investigations
of
cases
from
the
past
which
were
supposed
to
be
similar
to
mine
although
as
far
as
i
was
able
to
follow
them
these
investigations
had
been
carried
out
very
carefully
now
i
do
mean
to
criticise
the
lawyer
work
with
all
of
this
and
the
document
i
read
was
only
one
of
many
but
even
so
and
this
is
something
i
will
say
at
that
time
i
could
see
any
progress
in
my
trial
at
all
and
what
sort
of
progress
had
you
been
hoping
for
asked
that
a
very
sensible
question
said
the
businessman
with
a
smile
it
only
very
rare
that
you
see
any
progress
in
these
proceedings
at
all
but
i
did
know
that
then
i
a
businessman
much
more
in
those
days
than
now
i
wanted
to
see
some
tangible
progress
it
should
have
all
been
moving
to
some
conclusion
or
at
least
should
have
been
moving
on
in
some
way
according
to
the
rules
instead
of
which
there
were
just
more
hearings
and
most
of
them
went
through
the
same
things
anyway
i
had
all
the
answers
off
pat
like
in
a
church
service
there
were
messengers
from
the
court
coming
to
me
at
work
several
times
a
week
or
they
came
to
me
at
home
or
anywhere
else
they
could
find
me
and
that
was
very
disturbing
of
course
but
at
least
now
things
are
better
in
that
respect
it
much
less
disturbing
when
they
contact
you
by
telephone
and
rumours
about
my
trial
even
started
to
spread
among
some
of
the
people
i
do
business
with
and
especially
my
relations
so
i
was
being
made
to
suffer
in
many
different
ways
but
there
was
still
not
the
slightest
sign
that
even
the
first
hearing
would
take
place
soon
so
i
went
to
the
lawyer
and
complained
about
it
he
explained
it
all
to
me
at
length
but
refused
to
do
anything
i
asked
for
has
any
influence
on
the
way
the
trial
proceeds
he
said
to
try
and
insist
on
it
in
any
of
the
documents
submitted
like
i
was
asking
was
simply
unheard
of
and
would
do
harm
to
both
him
and
me
i
thought
to
myself
what
this
lawyer
ca
or
wo
do
another
lawyer
will
so
i
looked
round
for
other
lawyers
and
before
you
say
anything
none
of
them
asked
for
a
definite
date
for
the
main
trial
and
none
of
them
got
one
and
anyway
apart
from
one
exception
which
i
talk
about
in
a
minute
it
really
is
impossible
that
one
thing
this
lawyer
did
mislead
me
about
but
besides
i
had
no
reason
to
regret
turning
to
other
lawyers
perhaps
you
already
heard
how
huld
talks
about
the
petty
lawyers
he
probably
made
them
sound
very
contemptible
to
you
and
he
right
they
are
contemptible
but
when
he
talks
about
them
and
compares
them
with
himself
and
his
colleagues
there
a
small
error
running
through
what
he
says
and
just
for
your
interest
i
tell
you
about
it
when
he
talks
about
the
lawyers
he
mixes
with
he
sets
them
apart
by
calling
them
the
lawyers
that
wrong
anyone
can
call
himself
if
he
wants
to
of
course
but
in
this
case
only
the
usage
of
the
court
can
make
that
distinction
you
see
the
court
says
that
besides
the
petty
lawyers
there
are
also
minor
lawyers
and
great
lawyers
this
one
and
his
colleagues
are
only
minor
lawyers
and
the
difference
in
rank
between
them
and
the
great
lawyers
who
i
only
ever
heard
about
and
never
seen
is
incomparably
greater
than
between
the
minor
lawyers
and
the
despised
petty
lawyers
the
great
lawyers
asked
who
are
they
then
how
do
you
contact
them
you
never
heard
about
them
then
said
the
businessman
there
hardly
anyone
who
been
accused
who
does
spend
a
lot
of
time
dreaming
about
the
great
lawyers
once
heard
about
them
it
best
if
you
do
let
yourself
be
misled
in
that
way
i
do
know
who
the
great
lawyers
are
and
there
probably
no
way
of
contacting
them
i
do
know
of
any
case
i
can
talk
about
with
certainty
where
they
taken
any
part
they
do
defend
a
lot
of
people
but
you
ca
get
hold
of
them
by
your
own
efforts
they
only
defend
those
who
they
want
to
defend
and
i
do
suppose
they
ever
take
on
cases
that
have
already
got
past
the
lower
courts
anyway
it
best
not
to
think
about
them
as
if
you
do
it
makes
the
discussions
with
the
other
lawyers
all
their
advice
and
all
that
they
do
manage
to
achieve
seem
so
unpleasant
and
useless
i
had
that
experience
myself
just
wanted
to
throw
everything
away
and
lay
at
home
in
bed
and
hear
nothing
more
about
it
but
that
of
course
would
be
the
stupidest
thing
you
could
do
and
you
would
be
left
in
peace
in
bed
for
very
long
either
so
you
were
thinking
about
the
great
lawyers
at
that
time
asked
not
for
very
long
said
the
businessman
and
smiled
again
you
ca
forget
about
them
entirely
i
afraid
especially
in
the
night
when
these
thoughts
come
so
easily
but
i
wanted
immediate
results
in
those
days
so
i
went
to
the
petty
lawyers
well
look
at
you
two
sat
huddled
together
called
leni
as
she
came
back
with
the
dish
and
stood
in
the
doorway
they
were
indeed
sat
close
together
if
either
of
them
turned
his
head
even
slightly
it
would
have
knocked
against
the
other
the
businessman
was
not
only
very
small
but
also
sat
hunched
down
so
that
was
also
forced
to
bend
down
low
if
he
wanted
to
hear
everything
not
quite
yet
called
out
to
turn
leni
away
his
hand
still
resting
on
the
businessman
hand
twitching
with
impatience
he
wanted
me
to
tell
him
about
my
trial
said
the
businessman
to
leni
carry
on
then
carry
on
she
said
she
spoke
to
the
businessman
with
affection
but
at
the
same
time
with
condescension
did
not
like
that
he
had
begun
to
learn
that
the
man
was
of
some
value
after
all
he
had
experience
at
least
and
he
was
willing
to
share
it
leni
was
probably
wrong
about
him
he
watched
her
in
irritation
as
leni
now
took
the
candle
from
the
businessman
hand
which
he
had
been
holding
on
to
all
this
time
wiped
his
hand
with
her
apron
and
then
knelt
beside
him
to
scratch
off
some
wax
that
had
dripped
from
the
candle
onto
his
trousers
you
were
about
to
tell
me
about
the
petty
lawyers
said
shoving
leni
hand
away
with
no
further
comment
what
wrong
with
you
today
asked
leni
tapped
him
gently
and
carried
on
with
what
she
had
been
doing
yes
the
petty
lawyers
said
the
businessman
putting
his
hand
to
his
brow
as
if
thinking
hard
wanted
to
help
him
and
said
you
wanted
immediate
results
and
so
went
to
the
petty
lawyers
yes
that
right
said
the
businessman
but
did
not
continue
with
what
he
been
saying
maybe
he
does
want
to
speak
about
it
in
front
of
leni
thought
suppressing
his
impatience
to
hear
the
rest
straight
away
and
stopped
trying
to
press
him
have
you
told
him
i
here
he
asked
leni
course
i
have
she
said
he
waiting
for
you
leave
block
alone
now
you
can
talk
to
block
later
he
still
be
here
still
hesitated
you
still
be
here
he
asked
the
businessman
wanting
to
hear
the
answer
from
him
and
not
wanting
leni
to
speak
about
the
businessman
as
if
he
there
he
was
full
of
secret
resentment
towards
leni
today
and
once
more
it
was
only
leni
who
answered
he
often
sleeps
here
he
sleeps
here
exclaimed
he
had
thought
the
businessman
would
just
wait
there
for
him
while
he
quickly
settled
his
business
with
the
lawyer
and
then
they
would
leave
together
to
discuss
everything
thoroughly
and
undisturbed
yes
said
leni
not
everyone
like
you
josef
allowed
to
see
the
lawyer
at
any
time
you
like
do
even
seem
surprised
that
the
lawyer
despite
being
ill
still
receives
you
at
eleven
at
night
you
take
it
far
too
much
for
granted
what
your
friends
do
for
you
well
your
friends
or
at
least
i
do
we
like
to
do
things
for
you
i
do
want
or
need
any
more
thanks
than
that
you
fond
of
me
fond
of
you
thought
at
first
and
only
then
it
occurred
to
him
well
yes
i
am
fond
of
her
nonetheless
what
he
said
forgetting
all
the
rest
was
he
receives
me
because
i
am
his
client
if
i
needed
anyone
else
help
i
have
to
beg
and
show
gratitude
whenever
i
do
anything
he
really
nasty
today
is
he
leni
asked
the
businessman
now
it
me
who
not
here
thought
and
nearly
lost
his
temper
with
the
businessman
when
with
the
same
rudeness
as
leni
he
said
the
lawyer
also
has
other
reasons
to
receive
him
his
case
is
much
more
interesting
than
mine
and
it
only
in
its
early
stages
too
it
probably
has
progressed
very
far
so
the
lawyer
still
likes
to
deal
with
him
that
all
change
later
on
yeah
yeah
said
leni
looking
at
the
businessman
and
laughing
he
does
half
talk
she
said
turning
to
face
you
ca
believe
a
word
he
says
he
as
talkative
as
he
is
sweet
maybe
that
why
the
lawyer
ca
stand
him
at
least
he
only
sees
him
when
he
in
the
right
mood
i
already
tried
hard
to
change
that
but
it
impossible
just
think
there
are
times
when
i
tell
him
block
here
and
he
does
receive
him
until
three
days
later
and
if
block
is
on
the
spot
when
he
called
then
everything
lost
and
it
all
has
to
start
all
over
again
that
why
i
let
block
sleep
here
it
would
be
the
first
time
huld
has
wanted
to
see
him
in
the
night
so
now
block
is
ready
for
that
sometimes
when
he
knows
block
is
still
here
he
even
change
his
mind
about
letting
him
in
to
see
him
looked
questioningly
at
the
businessman
the
latter
nodded
and
although
he
had
spoken
quite
openly
with
earlier
seemed
to
be
confused
with
shame
as
he
said
yes
later
on
you
become
very
dependent
on
your
lawyer
he
only
pretending
to
mind
said
leni
he
likes
to
sleep
here
really
he
often
said
so
she
went
over
to
a
little
door
and
shoved
it
open
do
you
want
to
see
his
bedroom
she
asked
went
over
to
the
low
windowless
room
and
looked
in
from
the
doorway
the
room
contained
a
narrow
bed
which
filled
it
completely
so
that
to
get
into
the
bed
you
would
need
to
climb
over
the
bedpost
at
the
head
of
the
bed
there
was
a
niche
in
the
wall
where
fastidiously
tidy
stood
a
candle
a
bottle
of
ink
and
a
pen
with
a
bundle
of
papers
which
were
probably
to
do
with
the
trial
you
sleep
in
the
maid
room
asked
as
he
went
back
to
the
businessman
leni
let
me
have
it
answered
the
businessman
it
has
many
advantages
looked
long
at
him
his
first
impression
of
the
businessman
had
perhaps
not
been
right
he
had
experience
as
his
trial
had
already
lasted
a
long
time
but
he
had
paid
a
heavy
price
for
this
experience
was
suddenly
unable
to
bear
the
sight
of
the
businessman
any
longer
bring
him
to
bed
then
he
called
out
to
leni
who
seemed
to
understand
him
for
himself
he
wanted
to
go
to
the
lawyer
and
by
dismissing
him
free
himself
from
not
only
the
lawyer
but
also
from
leni
and
the
businessman
but
before
he
had
reached
the
door
the
businessman
spoke
to
him
gently
excuse
me
sir
he
said
and
looked
round
crossly
you
forgotten
your
promise
said
the
businessman
stretching
his
hand
out
to
imploringly
from
where
he
sat
you
were
going
to
tell
me
a
secret
that
is
true
said
as
he
glanced
at
leni
who
was
watching
him
carefully
to
check
on
her
so
listen
hardly
a
secret
now
anyway
i
going
to
see
the
lawyer
now
to
sack
him
he
sacking
him
yelled
the
businessman
and
he
jumped
up
from
his
chair
and
ran
around
the
kitchen
with
his
arms
in
the
air
he
kept
on
shouting
he
sacking
his
lawyer
leni
tried
to
rush
at
but
the
businessman
got
in
her
way
so
that
she
shoved
him
away
with
her
fists
then
still
with
her
hands
balled
into
fists
she
ran
after
who
however
had
been
given
a
long
start
he
was
already
inside
the
lawyer
room
by
the
time
leni
caught
up
with
him
he
had
almost
closed
the
door
behind
himself
but
leni
held
the
door
open
with
her
foot
grabbed
his
arm
and
tried
to
pull
him
back
but
he
put
such
pressure
on
her
wrist
that
with
a
sigh
she
was
forced
to
release
him
she
did
not
dare
go
into
the
room
straight
away
and
locked
the
door
with
the
key
i
been
waiting
for
you
a
very
long
time
said
the
lawyer
from
his
bed
he
had
been
reading
something
by
the
light
of
a
candle
but
now
he
laid
it
onto
the
bedside
table
and
put
his
glasses
on
looking
at
sharply
through
them
instead
of
apologising
said
i
be
leaving
again
soon
as
he
had
not
apologised
the
lawyer
ignored
what
said
and
replied
i
wo
let
you
in
this
late
again
next
time
i
find
that
quite
acceptable
said
the
lawyer
looked
at
him
quizzically
sit
down
he
said
as
you
wish
said
drawing
a
chair
up
to
the
bedside
table
and
sitting
down
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
locked
the
door
said
the
lawyer
yes
said
it
was
because
of
leni
he
had
no
intention
of
letting
anyone
off
lightly
but
the
lawyer
asked
him
was
she
being
importunate
again
importunate
asked
yes
said
the
lawyer
laughing
as
he
did
so
had
a
fit
of
coughing
and
then
once
it
had
passed
began
to
laugh
again
i
sure
you
must
have
noticed
how
importunate
she
can
be
sometimes
he
said
and
patted
hand
which
had
rested
on
the
bedside
table
and
which
he
now
snatched
back
you
do
attach
much
importance
to
it
then
said
the
lawyer
when
was
silent
so
much
the
better
otherwise
i
might
have
needed
to
apologise
to
you
it
is
a
peculiarity
of
leni
i
long
since
forgiven
her
for
it
and
i
would
be
talking
of
it
now
if
you
had
locked
the
door
just
now
anyway
perhaps
i
should
at
least
explain
this
peculiarity
of
hers
to
you
but
you
seem
rather
disturbed
the
way
you
looking
at
me
and
so
that
why
i
do
it
this
peculiarity
of
hers
consists
in
this
leni
finds
most
of
the
accused
attractive
she
attaches
herself
to
each
of
them
loves
each
of
them
even
seems
to
be
loved
by
each
of
them
then
she
sometimes
entertains
me
by
telling
me
about
them
when
i
allow
her
to
i
am
not
so
astonished
by
all
of
this
as
you
seem
to
be
if
you
look
at
them
in
the
right
way
the
accused
really
can
be
attractive
quite
often
but
that
is
a
remarkable
and
to
some
extent
scientific
phenomenon
being
indicted
does
not
cause
any
clear
precisely
definable
change
in
a
person
appearance
of
course
but
it
not
like
with
other
legal
matters
most
of
them
remain
in
their
usual
way
of
life
and
if
they
have
a
good
lawyer
looking
after
them
the
trial
does
get
in
their
way
but
there
are
nonetheless
those
who
have
experience
in
these
matters
who
can
look
at
a
crowd
however
big
and
tell
you
which
among
them
is
facing
a
charge
how
can
they
do
that
you
will
ask
my
answer
will
not
please
you
it
is
simply
that
those
who
are
facing
a
charge
are
the
most
attractive
it
can
not
be
their
guilt
that
makes
them
attractive
as
not
all
of
them
are
guilty
at
least
that
what
i
as
a
lawyer
have
to
say
and
nor
can
it
be
the
proper
punishment
that
has
made
them
attractive
as
not
all
of
them
are
punished
so
it
can
only
be
that
the
proceedings
levelled
against
them
take
some
kind
of
hold
on
them
whatever
the
reason
some
of
these
attractive
people
are
indeed
very
attractive
but
all
of
them
are
attractive
even
block
pitiful
worm
that
he
is
as
the
lawyer
finished
what
he
was
saying
was
fully
in
control
of
himself
he
had
even
nodded
conspicuously
at
his
last
few
words
in
order
to
confirm
to
himself
the
view
he
had
already
formed
that
the
lawyer
was
trying
to
confuse
him
as
he
always
did
by
making
general
and
irrelevant
observations
and
thus
distract
him
from
the
main
question
of
what
he
was
actually
doing
for
trial
the
lawyer
must
have
noticed
that
was
offering
him
more
resistance
than
before
as
he
became
silent
giving
the
chance
to
speak
himself
and
then
as
also
remained
silent
he
asked
did
you
have
a
particular
reason
for
coming
to
see
me
today
yes
said
putting
his
hand
up
to
slightly
shade
his
eyes
from
the
light
of
the
candle
so
that
he
could
see
the
lawyer
better
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
i
withdrawing
my
representation
from
you
with
immediate
effect
do
i
understand
you
rightly
asked
the
lawyer
as
he
half
raised
himself
in
his
bed
and
supported
himself
with
one
hand
on
the
pillow
i
think
you
do
said
sitting
stiffly
upright
as
if
waiting
in
ambush
well
we
can
certainly
discuss
this
plan
of
yours
said
the
lawyer
after
a
pause
it
not
a
plan
any
more
said
that
may
be
said
the
lawyer
but
we
still
must
rush
anything
he
used
the
word
as
if
he
had
no
intention
of
letting
go
free
and
as
if
even
if
he
could
no
longer
represent
him
he
could
still
at
least
continue
as
his
adviser
nothing
is
being
rushed
said
standing
slowly
up
and
going
behind
his
chair
everything
has
been
well
thought
out
and
probably
even
for
too
long
the
decision
is
final
then
allow
me
to
say
a
few
words
said
the
lawyer
throwing
the
bed
cover
to
one
side
and
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
his
naked
haired
legs
shivered
in
the
cold
he
asked
to
pass
him
a
blanket
from
the
couch
passed
him
the
blanket
and
said
you
are
running
the
risk
of
catching
cold
for
no
reason
the
circumstances
are
important
enough
said
the
lawyer
as
he
wrapped
the
bed
cover
around
the
top
half
of
his
body
and
then
the
blanket
around
his
legs
your
uncle
is
my
friend
and
in
the
course
of
time
i
become
fond
of
you
as
well
i
admit
that
quite
openly
there
nothing
in
that
for
me
to
be
ashamed
of
it
was
very
unwelcome
for
to
hear
the
old
man
speak
in
this
touching
way
as
it
forced
him
to
explain
himself
more
fully
which
he
would
rather
have
avoided
and
he
was
aware
that
it
also
confused
him
even
though
it
could
never
make
him
reverse
his
decision
thank
you
for
feeling
so
friendly
toward
me
he
said
and
i
also
realise
how
deeply
involved
you
been
in
my
case
as
deeply
as
possible
for
yourself
and
to
bring
as
much
advantage
as
possible
to
me
nonetheless
i
have
recently
come
to
the
conviction
that
it
is
not
enough
i
would
naturally
never
attempt
considering
that
you
are
so
much
older
and
more
experienced
than
i
am
to
convince
you
of
my
opinion
if
i
have
ever
unintentionally
done
so
then
i
beg
your
forgiveness
but
as
you
have
just
said
yourself
the
circumstances
are
important
enough
and
it
is
my
belief
that
my
trial
needs
to
be
approached
with
much
more
vigour
than
has
so
far
been
the
case
i
see
said
the
lawyer
you
become
impatient
i
am
not
impatient
said
with
some
irritation
and
he
stopped
paying
so
much
attention
to
his
choice
of
words
when
i
first
came
here
with
my
uncle
you
probably
noticed
i
was
greatly
concerned
about
my
case
and
if
i
was
reminded
of
it
by
force
as
it
were
i
would
forget
about
it
completely
but
my
uncle
insisted
i
should
allow
you
to
represent
me
and
i
did
so
as
a
favour
to
him
i
could
have
expected
the
case
to
be
less
of
a
burden
than
it
had
been
as
the
point
of
taking
on
a
lawyer
is
that
he
should
take
on
some
of
its
weight
but
what
actually
happened
was
the
opposite
before
the
trial
was
never
such
a
worry
for
me
as
it
has
been
since
you
been
representing
me
when
i
was
by
myself
i
never
did
anything
about
my
case
i
was
hardly
aware
of
it
but
then
once
there
was
someone
representing
me
everything
was
set
for
something
to
happen
i
was
always
without
cease
waiting
for
you
to
do
something
getting
more
and
more
tense
but
you
did
nothing
i
did
get
some
information
about
the
court
from
you
that
i
probably
could
not
have
got
anywhere
else
but
that
ca
be
enough
when
the
trial
supposedly
in
secret
is
getting
closer
and
closer
to
me
had
pushed
the
chair
away
and
stood
erect
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
frock
coat
after
a
certain
point
in
the
proceedings
said
the
lawyer
quietly
and
calmly
nothing
new
of
any
importance
ever
happens
so
many
litigants
at
the
same
stage
in
their
trials
have
stood
before
me
just
like
you
are
now
and
spoken
in
the
same
way
then
these
other
litigants
said
have
all
been
right
just
as
i
am
that
does
not
show
that
i
not
i
was
trying
to
show
that
you
were
mistaken
said
the
lawyer
but
i
wanted
to
add
that
i
expected
better
judgement
from
you
than
from
the
others
especially
as
i
given
you
more
insight
into
the
workings
of
the
court
and
my
own
activities
than
i
normally
do
and
now
i
forced
to
accept
that
despite
everything
you
have
too
little
trust
in
me
you
do
make
it
easy
for
me
how
the
lawyer
was
humiliating
himself
to
he
was
showing
no
regard
for
the
dignity
of
his
position
which
on
this
point
must
have
been
at
its
most
sensitive
and
why
did
he
do
that
he
did
seem
to
be
very
busy
as
a
lawyer
as
well
a
rich
man
neither
the
loss
of
income
nor
the
loss
of
a
client
could
have
been
of
much
importance
to
him
in
themselves
he
was
moreover
unwell
and
should
have
been
thinking
of
passing
work
on
to
others
and
despite
all
that
he
held
on
tightly
to
why
was
it
something
personal
for
his
uncle
sake
or
did
he
really
see
case
as
one
that
was
exceptional
and
hoped
to
be
able
to
distinguish
himself
with
it
either
for
sake
or
and
this
possibility
could
never
be
excluded
for
his
friends
at
the
court
it
was
not
possible
to
learn
anything
by
looking
at
him
even
though
was
scrutinizing
him
quite
brazenly
it
could
almost
be
supposed
he
was
deliberately
hiding
his
thoughts
as
he
waited
to
see
what
effect
his
words
would
have
but
he
clearly
deemed
silence
to
be
favourable
for
himself
and
he
continued
you
will
have
noticed
the
size
of
my
office
but
that
i
do
employ
any
staff
to
help
me
that
used
to
be
quite
different
there
was
a
time
when
several
young
lawyers
were
working
for
me
but
now
i
work
alone
this
is
partly
to
do
with
changes
in
the
way
i
do
business
in
that
i
concentrate
nowadays
more
and
more
on
matters
such
as
your
own
case
and
partly
to
do
with
the
ever
deeper
understanding
that
i
acquire
from
these
legal
matters
i
found
that
i
could
never
let
anyone
else
deal
with
this
sort
of
work
unless
i
wanted
to
harm
both
the
client
and
the
job
i
had
taken
on
but
the
decision
to
do
all
the
work
myself
had
its
obvious
result
i
was
forced
to
turn
almost
everyone
away
who
asked
me
to
represent
them
and
could
only
accept
those
i
was
especially
interested
in
well
there
are
enough
creatures
who
leap
at
every
crumb
i
throw
down
and
they
not
so
very
far
away
most
importantly
i
became
ill
from
but
despite
that
i
regret
my
decision
quite
possibly
i
should
have
turned
more
cases
away
than
i
did
but
it
did
turn
out
to
be
entirely
necessary
for
me
to
devote
myself
fully
to
the
cases
i
did
take
on
and
the
successful
results
showed
that
it
was
worth
it
i
once
read
a
description
of
the
difference
between
representing
someone
in
ordinary
legal
matters
and
in
legal
matters
of
this
sort
and
the
writer
expressed
it
very
well
this
is
what
he
said
some
lawyers
lead
their
clients
on
a
thread
until
judgement
is
passed
but
there
are
others
who
immediately
lift
their
clients
onto
their
shoulders
and
carry
them
all
the
way
to
the
judgement
and
beyond
that
just
how
it
is
but
it
was
quite
true
when
i
said
i
never
regret
all
this
work
but
if
as
in
your
case
they
are
so
fully
misunderstood
well
then
i
come
very
close
to
regretting
it
all
this
talking
did
more
to
make
impatient
than
to
persuade
him
from
the
way
the
lawyer
was
speaking
thought
he
could
hear
what
he
could
expect
if
he
gave
in
the
delays
and
excuses
would
begin
again
reports
of
how
the
documents
were
progressing
how
the
mood
of
the
court
officials
had
improved
as
well
as
all
the
enormous
difficulties
in
short
all
that
he
had
heard
so
many
times
before
would
be
brought
out
again
even
more
fully
he
would
try
to
mislead
with
hopes
that
were
never
specified
and
to
make
him
suffer
with
threats
that
were
never
clear
he
had
to
put
a
stop
to
that
so
he
said
what
will
you
undertake
on
my
behalf
if
you
continue
to
represent
me
the
lawyer
quietly
accepted
even
this
insulting
question
and
answered
i
should
continue
with
what
i
already
been
doing
for
you
that
just
what
i
thought
said
and
now
you
do
need
to
say
another
word
i
will
make
one
more
attempt
said
the
lawyer
as
if
whatever
had
been
making
so
annoyed
was
affecting
him
too
you
see
i
have
the
impression
that
you
have
not
only
misjudged
the
legal
assistance
i
have
given
you
but
also
that
that
misjudgement
has
led
you
to
behave
in
this
way
you
seem
although
you
are
the
accused
to
have
been
treated
too
well
or
to
put
it
a
better
way
handled
with
neglect
with
apparent
neglect
even
that
has
its
reason
it
is
often
better
to
be
in
chains
than
to
be
free
but
i
would
like
to
show
you
how
other
defendants
are
treated
perhaps
you
will
succeed
in
learning
something
from
it
what
i
will
do
is
i
will
call
block
in
unlock
the
door
and
sit
down
here
beside
the
bedside
table
be
glad
to
said
and
did
as
the
lawyer
suggested
he
was
always
ready
to
learn
something
new
but
to
make
sure
of
himself
for
any
event
he
added
but
you
do
realise
that
you
are
no
longer
to
be
my
lawyer
do
you
yes
said
the
lawyer
but
you
can
still
change
your
mind
today
if
you
want
to
he
lay
back
down
in
the
bed
pulled
the
quilt
up
to
his
chin
and
turned
to
face
the
wall
then
he
rang
leni
appeared
almost
the
moment
he
had
done
so
she
looked
hurriedly
at
and
the
lawyer
to
try
and
find
out
what
had
happened
she
seemed
to
be
reassured
by
the
sight
of
sitting
calmly
at
the
lawyer
bed
she
smiled
and
nodded
to
looked
blankly
back
at
her
fetch
block
said
the
lawyer
but
instead
of
going
to
fetch
him
leni
just
went
to
the
door
and
called
out
block
to
the
lawyer
then
probably
because
the
lawyer
had
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
and
was
paying
no
attention
she
slipped
in
behind
chair
from
then
on
she
bothered
him
by
leaning
forward
over
the
back
of
the
chair
or
albeit
very
tenderly
and
carefully
she
would
run
her
hands
through
his
hair
and
over
his
cheeks
eventually
tried
to
stop
her
by
taking
hold
of
one
hand
and
after
some
resistance
leni
let
him
keep
hold
of
it
block
came
as
soon
as
he
was
called
but
he
remained
standing
in
the
doorway
and
seemed
to
be
wondering
whether
he
should
enter
or
not
he
raised
his
eyebrows
and
lowered
his
head
as
if
listening
to
find
out
whether
the
order
to
attend
the
lawyer
would
be
repeated
could
have
encouraged
to
enter
but
he
had
decided
to
make
a
final
break
not
only
with
the
lawyer
but
with
everything
in
his
home
so
he
kept
himself
motionless
leni
was
also
silent
block
noticed
that
at
least
was
chasing
him
away
and
on
tiptoe
he
entered
the
room
his
face
was
tense
his
hands
were
clenched
behind
his
back
he
left
the
door
open
in
case
he
needed
to
go
back
again
did
not
even
glance
at
him
he
looked
instead
only
at
the
thick
quilt
under
which
the
lawyer
could
not
be
seen
as
he
had
squeezed
up
very
close
to
the
wall
then
his
voice
was
heard
block
here
he
asked
block
had
already
crept
some
way
into
the
room
but
this
question
seemed
to
give
him
first
a
shove
in
the
breast
and
then
another
in
the
back
he
seemed
about
to
fall
but
remained
standing
deeply
bowed
and
said
at
your
service
sir
what
do
you
want
asked
the
lawyer
you
come
at
a
bad
time
was
i
summoned
asked
block
more
to
himself
than
the
lawyer
he
held
his
hands
in
front
of
himself
as
protection
and
would
have
been
ready
to
run
away
any
moment
you
were
summoned
said
the
lawyer
but
you
have
still
come
at
a
bad
time
then
after
a
pause
he
added
you
always
come
at
a
bad
time
when
the
lawyer
started
speaking
block
had
stopped
looking
at
the
bed
but
stared
rather
into
one
of
the
corners
just
listening
as
if
the
light
from
the
speaker
were
brighter
than
block
could
bear
to
look
at
but
it
was
also
difficult
for
him
to
listen
as
the
lawyer
was
speaking
into
the
wall
and
speaking
quickly
and
quietly
would
you
like
me
to
go
away
again
sir
asked
block
well
you
here
now
said
the
lawyer
stay
it
was
as
if
the
lawyer
had
not
done
as
block
had
wanted
but
instead
threatened
him
with
a
stick
as
now
block
really
began
to
shake
i
went
to
see
said
the
lawyer
the
third
judge
yesterday
a
friend
of
mine
and
slowly
brought
the
conversation
round
to
the
subject
of
you
do
you
want
to
know
what
he
said
oh
yes
please
said
block
the
lawyer
did
not
answer
immediately
so
block
repeated
his
request
and
lowered
his
head
as
if
about
to
kneel
down
but
then
spoke
to
him
what
do
you
think
you
doing
he
shouted
leni
had
wanted
to
stop
him
from
calling
out
and
so
he
took
hold
of
her
other
hand
it
was
not
love
that
made
him
squeeze
it
and
hold
on
to
it
so
tightly
she
sighed
frequently
and
tried
to
disengage
her
hands
from
him
but
block
was
punished
for
outburst
as
the
lawyer
asked
him
who
is
your
lawyer
you
are
sir
said
block
and
who
besides
me
the
lawyer
asked
besides
you
sir
said
block
and
let
there
be
besides
me
said
the
lawyer
block
fully
understood
what
that
meant
he
glowered
at
shaking
his
head
violently
if
these
actions
had
been
translated
into
words
they
would
have
been
coarse
insults
had
been
friendly
and
willing
to
discuss
his
own
case
with
someone
like
this
i
disturb
you
any
more
said
leaning
back
in
his
chair
you
can
kneel
down
or
creep
on
all
fours
whatever
you
like
i
wo
bother
with
you
any
more
but
block
still
had
some
sense
of
pride
at
least
where
was
concerned
and
he
went
towards
him
waving
his
fists
shouting
as
loudly
as
he
dared
while
the
lawyer
was
there
you
should
speak
to
me
like
that
that
not
allowed
why
are
you
insulting
me
especially
here
in
front
of
the
lawyer
where
both
of
us
you
and
me
we
only
tolerated
because
of
his
charity
you
not
a
better
person
than
me
you
been
accused
of
something
too
facing
a
charge
too
if
in
spite
of
that
you
still
a
gentleman
then
i
just
as
much
a
gentleman
as
you
are
if
not
even
more
so
and
i
want
to
be
spoken
to
as
a
gentleman
especially
by
you
if
you
think
being
allowed
to
sit
there
and
quietly
listen
while
i
creep
on
all
fours
as
you
put
it
makes
you
something
better
than
me
then
there
an
old
legal
saying
you
ought
to
bear
in
mind
if
you
under
suspicion
better
to
be
moving
than
still
as
if
you
still
you
can
be
in
the
pan
of
the
scales
without
knowing
it
and
be
weighed
along
with
your
sins
said
nothing
he
merely
looked
in
amazement
at
this
distracted
being
his
eyes
completely
still
he
had
gone
through
such
changes
in
just
the
last
few
hours
was
it
the
trial
that
was
throwing
him
from
side
to
side
in
this
way
and
stopped
him
knowing
who
was
friend
and
who
was
foe
could
he
not
see
the
lawyer
was
deliberately
humiliating
him
and
had
no
other
purpose
today
than
to
show
off
his
power
to
and
perhaps
even
thereby
subjugate
but
if
block
was
incapable
of
seeing
that
or
if
he
so
feared
the
lawyer
that
no
such
insight
would
even
be
of
any
use
to
him
how
was
it
that
he
was
either
so
sly
or
so
bold
as
to
lie
to
the
lawyer
and
conceal
from
him
the
fact
that
he
had
other
lawyers
working
on
his
behalf
and
how
did
he
dare
to
attack
who
could
betray
his
secret
any
time
he
liked
but
he
dared
even
more
than
this
he
went
to
the
lawyer
bed
and
began
there
to
make
complaints
about
huld
sir
he
said
did
you
hear
the
way
this
man
spoke
to
me
you
can
count
the
length
of
his
trial
in
hours
and
he
wants
to
tell
me
what
to
do
when
i
been
involved
in
a
legal
case
for
five
years
he
even
insults
me
he
does
know
anything
but
he
insults
me
when
i
as
far
as
my
weak
ability
allows
when
i
made
a
close
study
of
how
to
behave
with
the
court
what
we
ought
to
do
and
what
the
court
practices
are
do
let
anyone
bother
you
said
the
lawyer
and
do
what
seems
to
you
to
be
right
i
will
said
block
as
if
speaking
to
himself
to
give
himself
courage
and
with
a
quick
glance
to
the
side
he
kneeled
down
close
beside
the
bed
i
kneeling
now
huld
sir
he
said
but
the
lawyer
remained
silent
with
one
hand
block
carefully
stroked
the
bed
cover
in
the
silence
while
he
did
so
leni
as
she
freed
herself
from
hands
said
you
hurting
me
let
go
of
me
i
going
over
to
block
she
went
over
to
him
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
block
was
very
pleased
at
this
and
with
lively
but
silent
gestures
he
immediately
urged
her
to
intercede
for
him
with
the
lawyer
it
was
clear
that
he
desperately
needed
to
be
told
something
by
the
lawyer
although
perhaps
only
so
that
he
could
make
use
of
the
information
with
his
other
lawyers
leni
probably
knew
very
well
how
the
lawyer
could
be
brought
round
pointed
to
his
hand
and
pursed
her
lips
as
if
making
a
kiss
block
immediately
performed
the
and
at
further
urging
from
leni
repeated
it
twice
more
but
the
lawyer
continued
to
be
silent
then
leni
leant
over
the
lawyer
as
she
stretched
out
the
attractive
shape
of
her
body
could
be
seen
and
bent
over
close
to
his
face
she
stroked
his
long
white
hair
that
now
forced
him
to
give
an
answer
i
rather
wary
of
telling
him
said
the
lawyer
and
his
head
could
be
seen
shaking
slightly
perhaps
so
that
he
would
feel
the
pressure
of
leni
hand
better
block
listened
closely
with
his
head
lowered
as
if
by
listening
he
were
breaking
an
order
what
makes
you
so
wary
about
it
asked
leni
had
the
feeling
he
was
listening
to
a
contrived
dialogue
that
had
been
repeated
many
times
that
would
be
repeated
many
times
more
and
that
for
block
alone
it
would
never
lose
its
freshness
what
has
his
behaviour
been
like
today
asked
the
lawyer
instead
of
an
answer
before
leni
said
anything
she
looked
down
at
block
and
watched
him
a
short
while
as
he
raised
his
hands
towards
her
and
rubbed
them
together
imploringly
finally
she
gave
a
serious
nod
turned
back
to
the
lawyer
and
said
he
been
quiet
and
industrious
this
was
an
elderly
businessman
a
man
whose
beard
was
long
and
he
was
begging
a
young
girl
to
speak
on
his
behalf
even
if
there
was
some
plan
behind
what
he
did
there
was
nothing
that
could
reinstate
him
in
the
eyes
of
his
fellow
man
could
not
understand
how
the
lawyer
could
have
thought
this
performance
would
win
him
over
even
if
he
had
done
nothing
earlier
to
make
him
want
to
leave
then
this
scene
would
have
done
so
it
was
almost
humiliating
even
for
the
onlooker
so
these
were
the
lawyer
methods
which
fortunately
had
not
been
exposed
to
for
long
to
let
the
client
forget
about
the
whole
world
and
leave
him
with
nothing
but
the
hope
of
reaching
the
end
of
his
trial
by
this
deluded
means
he
was
no
longer
a
client
he
was
the
lawyer
dog
if
the
lawyer
had
ordered
him
to
crawl
under
the
bed
as
if
it
were
a
kennel
and
to
bark
out
from
under
it
then
he
would
have
done
so
with
enthusiasm
listened
to
all
of
this
testing
it
and
thinking
it
over
as
if
he
had
been
given
the
task
of
closely
observing
everything
spoken
here
inform
a
higher
office
about
it
and
write
a
report
and
what
has
he
been
doing
all
day
asked
the
lawyer
i
kept
him
locked
in
the
maid
room
all
day
said
leni
so
that
he
would
stop
me
doing
my
work
that
where
he
usually
stays
from
time
to
time
i
looked
in
through
the
spyhole
to
see
what
he
was
doing
and
each
time
he
was
kneeling
on
the
bed
and
reading
the
papers
you
gave
him
propped
up
on
the
window
sill
that
made
a
good
impression
on
me
as
the
window
only
opens
onto
an
air
shaft
and
gives
hardly
any
light
it
showed
how
obedient
he
is
that
he
was
even
reading
in
those
conditions
i
pleased
to
hear
it
said
the
lawyer
but
did
he
understand
what
he
was
reading
while
this
conversation
was
going
on
block
continually
moved
his
lips
and
was
clearly
formulating
the
answers
he
hoped
leni
would
give
well
i
ca
give
you
any
certain
answer
to
that
of
course
said
leni
but
i
could
see
that
he
was
reading
thoroughly
he
spent
all
day
reading
the
same
page
running
his
finger
along
the
lines
whenever
i
looked
in
on
him
he
sighed
as
if
this
reading
was
a
lot
of
work
for
him
i
expect
the
papers
you
gave
him
were
very
hard
to
understand
yes
said
the
lawyer
they
certainly
are
that
and
i
really
do
think
he
understood
anything
of
them
but
they
should
at
least
give
him
some
inkling
of
just
how
hard
a
struggle
it
is
and
how
much
work
it
is
for
me
to
defend
him
and
who
am
i
doing
all
this
hard
work
for
i
doing
it
it
laughable
even
to
say
it
i
doing
it
for
block
he
ought
to
realise
what
that
means
too
did
he
study
without
a
pause
almost
without
a
pause
answered
leni
just
the
once
he
asked
me
for
a
drink
of
water
so
i
gave
him
a
glassful
through
the
window
then
at
eight
i
let
him
out
and
gave
him
something
to
eat
block
glanced
sideways
at
as
if
he
were
being
praised
and
had
to
impress
as
well
he
now
seemed
more
optimistic
he
moved
more
freely
and
rocked
back
and
forth
on
his
knees
this
made
his
astonishment
all
the
more
obvious
when
he
heard
the
following
words
from
the
lawyer
you
speak
well
of
him
said
the
lawyer
but
that
just
what
makes
it
difficult
for
me
you
see
the
judge
did
not
speak
well
of
him
at
all
neither
about
block
nor
about
his
case
did
speak
well
of
him
asked
leni
how
is
that
possible
block
looked
at
her
with
such
tension
he
seemed
to
think
that
although
the
judge
words
had
been
spoken
so
long
before
she
would
be
able
to
change
them
in
his
favour
not
at
all
said
the
lawyer
in
fact
he
became
quite
cross
when
i
started
to
talk
about
block
to
him
talk
to
me
about
block
he
said
is
my
client
said
i
letting
him
abuse
you
he
said
do
think
his
case
is
lost
yet
said
i
letting
him
abuse
you
he
repeated
do
think
so
said
i
works
hard
in
his
case
and
always
knows
where
it
stands
he
practically
lives
with
me
so
that
he
always
knows
what
happening
you
do
always
find
such
enthusiasm
as
that
not
very
pleasant
personally
i
grant
you
his
manners
are
terrible
and
he
dirty
but
as
far
as
the
trial
concerned
he
quite
immaculate
i
said
immaculate
but
i
was
deliberately
exaggerating
then
he
said
is
sly
that
all
he
accumulated
plenty
of
experience
and
knows
how
to
delay
proceedings
but
there
more
that
he
does
know
than
he
does
what
do
you
think
he
say
if
he
learned
his
trial
still
has
begun
if
you
told
him
they
have
even
rung
the
bell
to
announce
the
start
of
proceedings
alright
block
alright
said
the
lawyer
as
at
these
words
block
had
begun
to
raise
himself
on
his
trembling
knees
and
clearly
wanted
to
plead
for
some
explanation
it
was
the
first
time
the
lawyer
had
spoken
any
clear
words
directly
to
block
he
looked
down
with
his
tired
eyes
half
blankly
and
half
at
block
who
slowly
sank
back
down
on
his
knees
under
this
gaze
what
the
judge
said
has
no
meaning
for
you
said
the
lawyer
you
be
frightened
at
every
word
if
you
do
it
again
i
wo
tell
you
anything
else
at
all
it
impossible
to
start
a
sentence
without
you
looking
at
me
as
if
you
were
receiving
your
final
judgement
you
should
be
ashamed
of
yourself
here
in
front
of
my
client
and
destroying
the
trust
he
has
for
me
just
what
is
it
you
want
still
alive
you
still
under
my
protection
there
no
point
in
worrying
somewhere
you
read
that
the
final
judgement
can
often
come
without
warning
from
anyone
at
any
time
and
in
the
right
circumstances
that
basically
true
but
it
also
true
that
i
dislike
your
anxiety
and
fear
and
see
that
you
do
have
the
trust
in
me
you
should
have
now
what
have
i
just
said
i
repeated
something
said
by
one
of
the
judges
you
know
that
there
are
so
many
various
opinions
about
the
procedure
that
they
form
into
a
great
big
pile
and
nobody
can
make
any
sense
of
them
this
judge
for
instance
sees
proceedings
as
starting
at
a
different
point
from
where
i
do
a
difference
of
opinion
nothing
more
at
a
certain
stage
in
the
proceedings
tradition
has
it
that
a
sign
is
given
by
ringing
a
bell
this
judge
sees
that
as
the
point
at
which
proceedings
begin
i
ca
set
out
all
the
opinions
opposed
to
that
view
here
and
you
would
understand
it
anyway
suffice
it
to
say
that
there
are
many
reasons
to
disagree
with
him
embarrassed
block
ran
his
fingers
through
the
pile
of
the
carpet
his
anxiety
about
what
the
judge
had
said
had
let
him
forget
his
inferior
status
towards
the
lawyer
for
a
while
he
thought
only
about
himself
and
turned
the
judges
words
round
to
examine
them
from
all
sides
block
said
leni
as
if
reprimanding
him
and
taking
hold
of
the
collar
of
his
coat
pulled
him
up
slightly
higher
leave
the
carpet
alone
and
listen
to
what
the
lawyer
is
saying
this
chapter
was
left
unfinished
chapter
nine
in
the
cathedral
a
very
important
italian
business
contact
of
the
bank
had
come
to
visit
the
city
for
the
first
time
and
was
given
the
task
of
showing
him
some
of
its
cultural
sights
at
any
other
time
he
would
have
seen
this
job
as
an
honour
but
now
when
he
was
finding
it
hard
even
to
maintain
his
current
position
in
the
bank
he
accepted
it
only
with
reluctance
every
hour
that
he
could
not
be
in
the
office
was
a
cause
of
concern
for
him
he
was
no
longer
able
to
make
use
of
his
time
in
the
office
anything
like
as
well
as
he
had
previously
he
spent
many
hours
merely
pretending
to
do
important
work
but
that
only
increased
his
anxiety
about
not
being
in
the
office
then
he
sometimes
thought
he
saw
the
deputy
director
who
was
always
watching
come
into
office
sit
at
his
desk
look
through
his
papers
receive
clients
who
had
almost
become
old
friends
of
and
lure
them
away
from
him
perhaps
he
even
discovered
mistakes
mistakes
that
seemed
to
threaten
from
a
thousand
directions
when
he
was
at
work
now
and
which
he
could
no
longer
avoid
so
now
if
he
was
ever
asked
to
leave
the
office
on
business
or
even
needed
to
make
a
short
business
trip
however
much
an
honour
it
seemed
and
tasks
of
this
sort
happened
to
have
increased
substantially
recently
there
was
always
the
suspicion
that
they
wanted
to
get
him
out
of
his
office
for
a
while
and
check
his
work
or
at
least
the
idea
that
they
thought
he
was
dispensable
it
would
not
have
been
difficult
for
him
to
turn
down
most
of
these
jobs
but
he
did
not
dare
to
do
so
because
if
his
fears
had
the
slightest
foundation
turning
the
jobs
down
would
have
been
an
acknowledgement
of
them
for
this
reason
he
never
demurred
from
accepting
them
and
even
when
he
was
asked
to
go
on
a
tiring
business
trip
lasting
two
days
he
said
nothing
about
having
to
go
out
in
the
rainy
autumn
weather
when
he
had
a
severe
chill
just
in
order
to
avoid
the
risk
of
not
being
asked
to
go
when
with
a
raging
headache
he
arrived
back
from
this
trip
he
learned
that
he
had
been
chosen
to
accompany
the
italian
business
contact
the
following
day
the
temptation
for
once
to
turn
the
job
down
was
very
great
especially
as
it
had
no
direct
connection
with
business
but
there
was
no
denying
that
social
obligations
towards
this
business
contact
were
in
themselves
important
enough
only
not
for
who
knew
quite
well
that
he
needed
some
successes
at
work
if
he
was
to
maintain
his
position
there
and
that
if
he
failed
in
that
it
would
not
help
him
even
if
this
italian
somehow
found
him
quite
charming
he
did
not
want
to
be
removed
from
his
workplace
for
even
one
day
as
the
fear
of
not
being
allowed
back
in
was
too
great
he
knew
full
well
that
the
fear
was
exaggerated
but
it
still
made
him
anxious
however
in
this
case
it
was
almost
impossible
to
think
of
an
acceptable
excuse
his
knowledge
of
italian
was
not
great
but
still
good
enough
the
deciding
factor
was
that
had
earlier
known
a
little
about
art
history
and
this
had
become
widely
known
around
the
bank
in
extremely
exaggerated
form
and
that
had
been
a
member
of
the
society
for
the
preservation
of
city
monuments
albeit
only
for
business
reasons
it
was
said
that
this
italian
was
an
art
lover
so
the
choice
of
to
accompany
him
was
a
matter
of
course
it
was
a
very
rainy
and
stormy
morning
when
in
a
foul
temper
at
the
thought
of
the
day
ahead
of
him
arrived
early
at
seven
in
the
office
so
that
he
could
at
least
do
some
work
before
his
visitor
would
prevent
him
he
had
spent
half
the
night
studying
a
book
of
italian
grammar
so
that
he
would
be
somewhat
prepared
and
was
very
tired
his
desk
was
less
attractive
to
him
than
the
window
where
he
had
spent
far
too
much
time
sitting
of
late
but
he
resisted
the
temptation
and
sat
down
to
his
work
unfortunately
just
then
the
servitor
came
in
and
reported
that
the
director
had
sent
him
to
see
whether
the
chief
clerk
was
already
in
his
office
if
he
was
then
would
he
please
be
so
kind
as
to
come
to
his
reception
room
as
the
gentleman
from
italy
was
already
there
i
come
straight
away
said
he
put
a
small
dictionary
in
his
pocket
took
a
guide
to
the
city
tourist
sites
under
his
arm
that
he
had
compiled
for
strangers
and
went
through
the
deputy
director
office
into
that
of
the
director
he
was
glad
he
had
come
into
the
office
so
early
and
was
able
to
be
of
service
immediately
nobody
could
seriously
have
expected
that
of
him
the
deputy
office
was
of
course
still
as
empty
as
the
middle
of
the
night
the
servitor
had
probably
been
asked
to
summon
him
too
but
without
success
as
entered
the
reception
room
two
men
stood
up
from
the
deep
armchairs
where
they
had
been
sitting
the
director
gave
him
a
friendly
smile
he
was
clearly
very
glad
that
was
there
he
immediately
introduced
him
to
the
italian
who
shook
hand
vigorously
and
joked
that
somebody
was
an
early
riser
did
not
quite
understand
whom
he
had
in
mind
it
was
moreover
an
odd
expression
to
use
and
it
took
a
little
while
to
guess
its
meaning
he
replied
with
a
few
bland
phrases
which
the
italian
received
once
more
with
a
laugh
passing
his
hand
nervously
and
repeatedly
over
his
bushy
moustache
this
moustache
was
obviously
perfumed
it
was
almost
tempting
to
come
close
to
it
and
sniff
when
they
had
all
sat
down
and
begun
a
light
preliminary
conversation
was
disconcerted
to
notice
that
he
understood
no
more
than
fragments
of
what
the
italian
said
when
he
spoke
very
calmly
he
understood
almost
everything
but
that
was
very
infrequent
mostly
the
words
gushed
from
his
mouth
and
he
seemed
to
be
enjoying
himself
so
much
his
head
shook
when
he
was
talking
in
this
way
his
speech
was
usually
wrapped
up
in
some
kind
of
dialect
which
seemed
to
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
italian
but
which
the
director
not
only
understood
but
also
spoke
although
ought
to
have
foreseen
this
as
the
italian
came
from
the
south
of
his
country
where
the
director
had
also
spent
several
years
whatever
the
cause
realised
that
the
possibility
of
communicating
with
the
italian
had
been
largely
taken
from
him
even
his
french
was
difficult
to
understand
and
his
moustache
concealed
the
movements
of
his
lips
which
might
have
offered
some
help
in
understanding
what
he
said
began
to
anticipate
many
difficulties
he
gave
up
trying
to
understand
what
the
italian
said
with
the
director
there
who
could
understand
him
so
easily
it
would
have
been
pointless
effort
and
for
the
time
being
did
no
more
than
scowl
at
the
italian
as
he
relaxed
sitting
deep
but
comfortable
in
the
armchair
as
he
frequently
pulled
at
his
short
sharply
tailored
jacket
and
at
one
time
lifted
his
arms
in
the
air
and
moved
his
hands
freely
to
try
and
depict
something
that
could
not
grasp
even
though
he
was
leaning
forward
and
did
not
let
the
hands
out
of
his
sight
had
nothing
to
occupy
himself
but
mechanically
watch
the
exchange
between
the
two
men
and
his
tiredness
finally
made
itself
felt
to
his
alarm
although
fortunately
in
good
time
he
once
caught
himself
nearly
getting
up
turning
round
and
leaving
eventually
the
italian
looked
at
the
clock
and
jumped
up
after
taking
his
leave
from
the
director
he
turned
to
pressing
himself
so
close
to
him
that
had
to
push
his
chair
back
just
so
that
he
could
move
the
director
had
no
doubt
seen
the
anxiety
in
eyes
as
he
tried
to
cope
with
this
dialect
of
italian
he
joined
in
with
this
conversation
in
a
way
that
was
so
adroit
and
unobtrusive
that
he
seemed
to
be
adding
no
more
than
minor
comments
whereas
in
fact
he
was
swiftly
and
patiently
breaking
into
what
the
italian
said
so
that
could
understand
learned
in
this
way
that
the
italian
first
had
a
few
business
matters
to
settle
that
he
unfortunately
had
only
a
little
time
at
his
disposal
that
he
certainly
did
not
intend
to
rush
round
to
see
every
monument
in
the
city
that
he
would
much
rather
at
least
as
long
as
would
agree
it
was
entirely
his
decision
just
see
the
cathedral
and
to
do
so
thoroughly
he
was
extremely
pleased
to
be
accompanied
by
someone
who
was
so
learned
and
so
pleasant
by
this
he
meant
who
was
occupied
not
with
listening
to
the
italian
but
the
director
and
asked
if
he
would
be
so
kind
if
the
time
was
suitable
to
meet
him
in
the
cathedral
in
two
hours
time
at
about
ten
he
hoped
he
would
certainly
be
able
to
be
there
at
that
time
made
an
appropriate
reply
the
italian
shook
first
the
director
hand
and
then
then
the
director
again
and
went
to
the
door
half
turned
to
the
two
men
who
followed
him
and
continuing
to
talk
without
a
break
remained
together
with
the
director
for
a
short
while
although
the
director
looked
especially
unhappy
today
he
thought
he
needed
to
apologise
to
for
something
and
told
him
they
were
standing
intimately
close
together
he
had
thought
at
first
he
would
accompany
the
italian
himself
but
then
he
gave
no
more
precise
reason
than
this
then
he
decided
it
would
be
better
to
send
with
him
he
should
not
be
surprised
if
he
could
not
understand
the
italian
at
first
he
would
be
able
to
very
soon
and
even
if
he
really
could
not
understand
very
much
he
said
it
was
not
so
bad
as
it
was
really
not
so
important
for
the
italian
to
be
understood
and
anyway
knowledge
of
italian
was
surprisingly
good
the
director
was
sure
he
would
get
by
very
well
and
with
that
it
was
time
for
to
go
he
spent
the
time
still
remaining
to
him
with
a
dictionary
copying
out
obscure
words
he
would
need
to
guide
the
italian
round
the
cathedral
it
was
an
extremely
irksome
task
servitors
brought
him
the
mail
bank
staff
came
with
various
queries
and
when
they
saw
that
was
busy
stood
by
the
door
and
did
not
go
away
until
he
had
listened
to
them
the
deputy
director
did
not
miss
the
opportunity
to
disturb
and
came
in
frequently
took
the
dictionary
from
his
hand
and
flicked
through
its
pages
clearly
for
no
purpose
when
the
door
to
the
opened
even
clients
would
appear
from
the
half
darkness
and
bow
timidly
to
him
they
wanted
to
attract
his
attention
but
were
not
sure
whether
he
had
seen
them
all
this
activity
was
circling
around
with
him
at
its
centre
while
he
compiled
the
list
of
words
he
would
need
then
looked
them
up
in
the
dictionary
then
wrote
them
out
then
practised
their
pronunciation
and
finally
tried
to
learn
them
by
heart
the
good
intentions
he
had
had
earlier
though
seemed
to
have
left
him
completely
it
was
the
italian
who
had
caused
him
all
this
effort
and
sometimes
he
became
so
angry
with
him
that
he
buried
the
dictionary
under
some
papers
firmly
intending
to
do
no
more
preparation
but
then
he
realised
he
could
not
walk
up
and
down
in
the
cathedral
with
the
italian
without
saying
a
word
so
in
an
even
greater
rage
he
pulled
the
dictionary
back
out
again
at
exactly
half
past
nine
just
when
he
was
about
to
leave
there
was
a
telephone
call
for
him
leni
wished
him
good
morning
and
asked
how
he
was
thanked
her
hurriedly
and
told
her
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
talk
now
as
he
had
to
go
to
the
cathedral
to
the
cathedral
asked
leni
yes
to
the
cathedral
what
do
you
have
to
go
to
the
cathedral
for
said
leni
tried
to
explain
it
to
her
briefly
but
he
had
hardly
begun
when
leni
suddenly
said
they
harassing
you
one
thing
that
could
not
bear
was
pity
that
he
had
not
wanted
or
expected
he
took
his
leave
of
her
with
two
words
but
as
he
put
the
receiver
back
in
its
place
he
said
half
to
himself
and
half
to
the
girl
on
the
other
end
of
the
line
who
could
no
longer
hear
him
yes
harassing
me
by
now
the
time
was
late
and
there
was
almost
a
danger
he
would
not
be
on
time
he
took
a
taxi
to
the
cathedral
at
the
last
moment
he
had
remembered
the
album
that
he
had
had
no
opportunity
to
give
to
the
italian
earlier
and
so
took
it
with
him
now
he
held
it
on
his
knees
and
drummed
impatiently
on
it
during
the
whole
journey
the
rain
had
eased
off
slightly
but
it
was
still
damp
chilly
and
dark
it
would
be
difficult
to
see
anything
in
the
cathedral
but
standing
about
on
cold
flagstones
might
well
make
chill
much
worse
the
square
in
front
of
the
cathedral
was
quite
empty
remembered
how
even
as
a
small
child
he
had
noticed
that
nearly
all
the
houses
in
this
narrow
square
had
the
curtains
at
their
windows
closed
most
of
the
time
although
today
with
the
weather
like
this
it
was
more
understandable
the
cathedral
also
seemed
quite
empty
of
course
would
think
of
going
there
on
a
day
like
this
hurried
along
both
the
side
naves
but
saw
but
an
old
woman
who
wrapped
up
in
a
warm
shawl
was
kneeling
at
a
picture
of
the
virgin
mary
and
staring
up
at
it
then
in
the
distance
he
saw
a
church
official
who
limped
away
through
a
doorway
in
the
wall
had
arrived
on
time
it
had
struck
ten
just
as
he
was
entering
the
building
but
the
italian
still
was
not
there
went
back
to
the
main
entrance
stood
there
indecisively
for
a
while
and
then
walked
round
the
cathedral
in
the
rain
in
case
the
italian
was
waiting
at
another
entrance
he
was
nowhere
to
be
found
could
the
director
have
misunderstood
what
time
they
had
agreed
on
how
could
anyone
understand
someone
like
that
properly
anyway
whatever
had
happened
would
have
to
wait
for
him
for
at
least
half
an
hour
as
he
was
tired
he
wanted
to
sit
down
he
went
back
inside
the
cathedral
he
found
something
like
a
small
carpet
on
one
of
the
steps
he
moved
it
with
his
foot
to
a
nearby
pew
wrapped
himself
up
tighter
in
his
coat
put
the
collar
up
and
sat
down
to
pass
the
time
he
opened
the
album
and
flicked
through
the
pages
a
little
but
soon
had
to
give
up
as
it
became
so
dark
that
when
he
looked
up
he
could
hardly
make
out
anything
in
the
side
nave
next
to
him
in
the
distance
there
was
a
large
triangle
of
candles
flickering
on
the
main
altar
was
not
certain
whether
he
had
seen
them
earlier
perhaps
they
had
only
just
been
lit
church
staff
creep
silently
as
part
of
their
job
you
do
notice
them
when
happened
to
turn
round
he
also
saw
a
tall
stout
candle
attached
to
a
column
not
far
behind
him
it
was
all
very
pretty
but
totally
inadequate
to
illuminate
the
pictures
which
were
usually
left
in
the
darkness
of
the
side
altars
and
seemed
to
make
the
darkness
all
the
deeper
it
was
discourteous
of
the
italian
not
to
come
but
it
was
also
sensible
of
him
there
would
have
been
nothing
to
see
they
would
have
had
to
content
themselves
with
seeking
out
a
few
pictures
with
electric
pocket
torch
and
looking
at
them
one
small
part
at
a
time
went
over
to
a
nearby
side
chapel
to
see
what
they
could
have
hoped
for
he
went
up
a
few
steps
to
a
low
marble
railing
and
leant
over
it
to
look
at
the
altar
picture
by
the
light
of
his
torch
the
eternal
light
hung
disturbingly
in
front
of
it
the
first
thing
that
partly
saw
and
partly
guessed
at
was
a
large
knight
in
armour
who
was
shown
at
the
far
edge
of
the
painting
he
was
leaning
on
his
sword
that
he
had
stuck
into
the
naked
ground
in
front
of
him
where
only
a
few
blades
of
grass
grew
here
and
there
he
seemed
to
be
paying
close
attention
to
something
that
was
being
played
out
in
front
of
him
it
was
astonishing
to
see
how
he
stood
there
without
going
any
closer
perhaps
it
was
his
job
to
stand
guard
it
was
a
long
time
since
had
looked
at
any
pictures
and
he
studied
the
knight
for
a
long
time
even
though
he
had
continually
to
blink
as
he
found
it
difficult
to
bear
the
green
light
of
his
torch
then
when
he
moved
the
light
to
the
other
parts
of
the
picture
he
found
an
interment
of
christ
shown
in
the
usual
way
it
was
also
a
comparatively
new
painting
he
put
his
torch
away
and
went
back
to
his
place
there
seemed
to
be
no
point
in
waiting
for
the
italian
any
longer
but
outside
it
was
certainly
raining
heavily
and
as
it
was
not
so
cold
in
the
cathedral
as
had
expected
he
decided
to
stay
there
for
the
time
being
close
by
him
was
the
great
pulpit
there
were
two
plain
golden
crosses
attached
to
its
little
round
roof
which
were
lying
almost
flat
and
whose
tips
crossed
over
each
other
the
outside
of
the
pulpit
balustrade
was
covered
in
green
foliage
which
continued
down
to
the
column
supporting
it
little
angels
could
be
seen
among
the
leaves
some
of
them
lively
and
some
of
them
still
walked
up
to
the
pulpit
and
examined
it
from
all
sides
its
stonework
had
been
sculpted
with
great
care
it
seemed
as
if
the
foliage
had
trapped
a
deep
darkness
between
and
behind
its
leaves
and
held
it
there
prisoner
lay
his
hand
in
one
of
these
gaps
and
cautiously
felt
the
stone
until
then
he
had
been
totally
unaware
of
this
pulpit
existence
then
happened
to
notice
one
of
the
church
staff
standing
behind
the
next
row
of
pews
he
wore
a
loose
creased
black
cassock
he
held
a
snuff
box
in
his
left
hand
and
he
was
watching
now
what
does
he
want
thought
do
i
seem
suspicious
to
him
does
he
want
a
tip
but
when
the
man
in
the
cassock
saw
that
had
noticed
him
he
raised
his
right
hand
a
pinch
of
snuff
still
held
between
two
fingers
and
pointed
in
some
vague
direction
it
was
almost
impossible
to
understand
what
this
behaviour
meant
waited
a
while
longer
but
the
man
in
the
cassock
did
not
stop
gesturing
with
his
hand
and
even
augmented
it
by
nodding
his
head
now
what
does
he
want
asked
quietly
he
did
not
dare
call
out
loud
here
but
then
he
drew
out
his
purse
and
pushed
his
way
through
the
nearest
pews
to
reach
the
man
he
however
immediately
gestured
to
turn
down
this
offer
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
limped
away
as
a
child
had
imitated
riding
on
a
horse
with
the
same
sort
of
movement
as
this
limp
this
old
man
is
like
a
child
thought
he
have
the
sense
for
anything
more
than
serving
in
a
church
look
at
the
way
he
stops
when
i
stop
and
how
he
waits
to
see
whether
continue
with
a
smile
followed
the
old
man
all
the
way
up
the
side
nave
and
almost
as
far
as
the
main
altar
all
this
time
the
old
man
continued
to
point
at
something
but
deliberately
avoided
looking
round
he
was
only
pointing
in
order
to
make
it
harder
for
to
follow
him
eventually
did
stop
following
he
did
not
want
to
worry
the
old
man
too
much
and
he
also
did
not
want
to
frighten
him
away
completely
in
case
the
italian
turned
up
after
all
when
he
entered
the
central
nave
to
go
back
to
where
he
had
left
the
album
he
noticed
a
small
secondary
pulpit
on
a
column
almost
next
to
the
stalls
by
the
altar
where
the
choir
sat
it
was
very
simple
made
of
plain
white
stone
and
so
small
that
from
a
distance
it
looked
like
an
empty
niche
where
the
statue
of
a
saint
ought
to
have
been
it
certainly
would
have
been
impossible
for
the
priest
to
take
a
full
step
back
from
the
balustrade
and
although
there
was
no
decoration
on
it
the
top
of
the
pulpit
curved
in
exceptionally
low
so
that
a
man
of
average
height
would
not
be
able
stand
upright
and
would
have
to
remain
bent
forward
over
the
balustrade
in
all
it
looked
as
if
it
had
been
intended
to
make
the
priest
suffer
it
was
impossible
to
understand
why
this
pulpit
would
be
needed
as
there
were
also
the
other
ones
available
which
were
large
and
so
artistically
decorated
and
would
certainly
not
have
noticed
this
little
pulpit
if
there
had
not
been
a
lamp
fastened
above
it
which
usually
meant
there
was
a
sermon
about
to
be
given
so
was
a
sermon
to
be
given
now
in
this
empty
church
looked
down
at
the
steps
which
pressed
close
against
the
column
led
up
to
the
pulpit
they
were
so
narrow
they
seemed
to
be
there
as
decoration
on
the
column
rather
than
for
anyone
to
use
but
under
the
pulpit
grinned
in
astonishment
there
really
was
a
priest
standing
with
his
hand
on
the
handrail
ready
to
climb
the
steps
and
looking
at
then
he
nodded
very
slightly
so
that
crossed
himself
and
genuflected
as
he
should
have
done
earlier
with
a
little
swing
the
priest
went
up
into
the
pulpit
with
short
fast
steps
was
there
really
a
sermon
about
to
begin
maybe
the
man
in
the
cassock
had
not
been
really
so
demented
and
had
meant
to
lead
way
to
the
preacher
which
in
this
empty
church
would
have
been
very
necessary
and
there
was
also
somewhere
in
front
of
a
picture
of
the
virgin
mary
an
old
woman
who
should
have
come
to
hear
the
sermon
and
if
there
was
to
be
a
sermon
why
had
it
not
been
introduced
on
the
organ
but
the
organ
remained
quiet
and
merely
looked
out
weakly
from
the
darkness
of
its
great
height
now
considered
whether
he
should
leave
as
quickly
as
possible
if
he
did
not
do
it
now
there
would
be
no
chance
of
doing
so
during
the
sermon
and
he
would
have
to
stay
there
for
as
long
as
it
lasted
he
had
lost
so
much
time
when
he
should
have
been
in
his
office
there
had
long
been
no
need
for
him
to
wait
for
the
italian
any
longer
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
eleven
but
could
there
really
be
a
sermon
given
could
constitute
the
entire
congregation
how
could
he
when
he
was
just
a
stranger
who
wanted
to
look
at
the
church
that
basically
was
all
he
was
the
idea
of
a
sermon
now
at
eleven
on
a
workday
in
hideous
weather
was
nonsense
the
priest
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
was
a
priest
a
young
man
with
a
smooth
dark
face
was
clearly
going
up
there
just
to
put
the
lamp
out
after
somebody
had
lit
it
by
mistake
but
there
had
been
no
mistake
the
priest
seemed
rather
to
check
that
the
lamp
was
lit
and
turned
it
a
little
higher
then
he
slowly
turned
to
face
the
front
and
leant
down
on
the
balustrade
gripping
its
angular
rail
with
both
hands
he
stood
there
like
that
for
a
while
and
without
turning
his
head
looked
around
had
moved
back
a
long
way
and
leant
his
elbows
on
the
front
pew
somewhere
in
the
church
he
could
not
have
said
exactly
where
he
could
make
out
the
man
in
the
cassock
hunched
under
his
bent
back
and
at
peace
as
if
his
work
were
completed
in
the
cathedral
it
was
now
very
quiet
but
would
have
to
disturb
that
silence
he
had
no
intention
of
staying
there
if
it
was
the
priest
duty
to
preach
at
a
certain
time
regardless
of
the
circumstances
then
he
could
and
he
could
do
it
without
taking
part
and
presence
would
do
nothing
to
augment
the
effect
of
it
so
began
slowly
to
move
felt
his
way
on
tiptoe
along
the
pew
arrived
at
the
broad
aisle
and
went
along
it
without
being
disturbed
except
for
the
sound
of
his
steps
however
light
which
rang
out
on
the
stone
floor
and
resounded
from
the
vaulting
quiet
but
continuous
at
a
repeating
regular
pace
felt
slightly
abandoned
as
probably
observed
by
the
priest
he
walked
by
himself
between
the
empty
pews
and
the
size
of
the
cathedral
seemed
to
be
just
at
the
limit
of
what
a
man
could
bear
when
he
arrived
back
at
where
he
had
been
sitting
he
did
not
hesitate
but
simply
reached
out
for
the
album
he
had
left
there
and
took
it
with
him
he
had
nearly
left
the
area
covered
by
pews
and
was
close
to
the
empty
space
between
himself
and
the
exit
when
for
the
first
time
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
priest
a
powerful
and
experienced
voice
it
pierced
through
the
reaches
of
the
cathedral
ready
waiting
for
it
but
the
priest
was
not
calling
out
to
the
congregation
his
cry
was
quite
unambiguous
and
there
was
no
escape
from
it
he
called
josef
stood
still
and
looked
down
at
the
floor
in
theory
he
was
still
free
he
could
have
carried
on
walking
through
one
of
three
dark
little
wooden
doors
not
far
in
front
of
him
and
away
from
there
it
would
simply
mean
he
had
not
understood
or
that
he
had
understood
but
chose
not
to
pay
attention
to
it
but
if
he
once
turned
round
he
would
be
trapped
then
he
would
have
acknowledged
that
he
had
understood
perfectly
well
that
he
really
was
the
josef
the
priest
had
called
to
and
that
he
was
willing
to
follow
if
the
priest
had
called
out
again
would
certainly
have
carried
on
out
the
door
but
everything
was
silent
as
also
waited
he
turned
his
head
slightly
as
he
wanted
to
see
what
the
priest
was
doing
now
he
was
merely
standing
in
the
pulpit
as
before
but
it
was
obvious
that
he
had
seen
turn
his
head
if
did
not
now
turn
round
completely
it
would
have
been
like
a
child
playing
hide
and
seek
he
did
so
and
the
priest
beckoned
him
with
his
finger
as
everything
could
now
be
done
openly
he
ran
because
of
curiosity
and
the
wish
to
get
it
over
with
with
long
flying
leaps
towards
the
pulpit
at
the
front
pews
he
stopped
but
to
the
priest
he
still
seemed
too
far
away
he
reached
out
his
hand
and
pointed
sharply
down
with
his
finger
to
a
place
immediately
in
front
of
the
pulpit
and
did
as
he
was
told
standing
in
that
place
he
had
to
bend
his
head
a
long
way
back
just
to
see
the
priest
you
are
josef
said
the
priest
and
raised
his
hand
from
the
balustrade
to
make
a
gesture
whose
meaning
was
unclear
yes
said
he
considered
how
freely
he
had
always
given
his
name
in
the
past
for
some
time
now
it
had
been
a
burden
to
him
now
there
were
people
who
knew
his
name
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
it
had
been
so
nice
first
to
introduce
yourself
and
only
then
for
people
to
know
who
you
were
you
have
been
accused
said
the
priest
especially
gently
yes
said
so
i
have
been
informed
then
you
are
the
one
i
am
looking
for
said
the
priest
i
am
the
prison
chaplain
i
see
said
i
had
you
summoned
here
said
the
priest
because
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
i
knew
nothing
of
that
said
i
came
here
to
show
the
cathedral
to
a
gentleman
from
italy
that
is
beside
the
point
said
the
priest
what
are
you
holding
in
your
hand
is
it
a
prayer
book
no
answered
it
an
album
of
the
city
tourist
sights
put
it
down
said
the
priest
threw
it
away
with
such
force
that
it
flapped
open
and
rolled
across
the
floor
tearing
its
pages
do
you
know
your
case
is
going
badly
asked
the
priest
that
how
it
seems
to
me
too
said
i
expended
a
lot
of
effort
on
it
but
so
far
with
no
result
although
i
do
still
have
some
documents
to
submit
how
do
you
imagine
it
will
end
asked
the
priest
at
first
i
thought
it
was
bound
to
end
well
said
but
now
i
have
my
doubts
about
it
i
do
know
how
it
will
end
do
you
know
i
do
said
the
priest
but
i
fear
it
will
end
badly
you
are
considered
guilty
your
case
will
probably
not
even
go
beyond
a
minor
court
provisionally
at
least
your
guilt
is
seen
as
proven
but
i
not
guilty
said
there
been
a
mistake
how
is
it
even
possible
for
someone
to
be
guilty
we
all
human
beings
here
one
like
the
other
that
is
true
said
the
priest
but
that
is
how
the
guilty
speak
do
you
presume
i
guilty
too
asked
i
make
no
presumptions
about
you
said
the
priest
i
thank
you
for
that
said
but
everyone
else
involved
in
these
proceedings
has
something
against
me
and
presumes
i
guilty
they
even
influence
those
who
are
involved
my
position
gets
harder
all
the
time
you
understand
the
facts
said
the
priest
the
verdict
does
not
come
suddenly
proceedings
continue
until
a
verdict
is
reached
gradually
i
see
said
lowering
his
head
what
do
you
intend
to
do
about
your
case
next
asked
the
priest
i
still
need
to
find
help
said
raising
his
head
to
see
what
the
priest
thought
of
this
there
are
still
certain
possibilities
i
have
yet
made
use
of
you
look
for
too
much
help
from
people
you
do
know
said
the
priest
disapprovingly
and
especially
from
women
can
you
really
not
see
that
not
the
help
you
need
sometimes
in
fact
quite
often
i
could
believe
you
right
said
but
not
always
women
have
a
lot
of
power
if
i
could
persuade
some
of
the
women
i
know
to
work
together
with
me
then
i
would
be
certain
to
succeed
especially
in
a
court
like
this
that
seems
to
consist
of
nothing
but
show
the
examining
judge
a
woman
in
the
distance
and
he
run
right
over
the
desk
and
the
accused
just
to
get
to
her
as
soon
as
he
can
the
priest
lowered
his
head
down
to
the
balustrade
only
now
did
the
roof
over
the
pulpit
seem
to
press
him
down
what
sort
of
dreadful
weather
could
it
be
outside
it
was
no
longer
just
a
dull
day
it
was
deepest
night
none
of
the
stained
glass
in
the
main
window
shed
even
a
flicker
of
light
on
the
darkness
of
the
walls
and
this
was
the
moment
when
the
man
in
the
cassock
chose
to
put
out
the
candles
on
the
main
altar
one
by
one
are
you
cross
with
me
asked
maybe
you
do
know
what
sort
of
court
it
is
you
serve
he
received
no
answer
well
just
my
own
experience
said
above
him
there
was
still
silence
i
did
mean
to
insult
you
said
at
that
the
priest
screamed
down
at
can
you
not
see
two
steps
in
front
of
you
he
shouted
in
anger
but
it
was
also
the
scream
of
one
who
sees
another
fall
and
shocked
and
without
thinking
screams
against
his
own
will
the
two
men
then
remained
silent
for
a
long
time
in
the
darkness
beneath
him
the
priest
could
not
possibly
have
seen
distinctly
although
was
able
to
see
him
clearly
by
the
light
of
the
little
lamp
why
did
the
priest
not
come
down
he
had
not
given
a
sermon
he
had
only
told
a
few
things
which
if
he
followed
them
closely
would
probably
cause
him
more
harm
than
good
but
the
priest
certainly
seemed
to
mean
well
it
might
even
be
possible
if
he
would
come
down
and
cooperate
with
him
it
might
even
be
possible
for
him
to
obtain
some
acceptable
piece
of
advice
that
could
make
all
the
difference
it
might
for
instance
be
able
to
show
him
not
so
much
to
influence
the
proceedings
but
how
to
break
free
of
them
how
to
evade
them
how
to
live
away
from
them
had
to
admit
that
this
was
something
he
had
had
on
his
mind
quite
a
lot
of
late
if
the
priest
knew
of
such
a
possibility
he
might
if
asked
him
let
him
know
about
it
even
though
he
was
part
of
the
court
himself
and
even
though
when
had
criticised
the
court
he
had
held
down
his
gentle
nature
and
actually
shouted
at
would
you
not
like
to
come
down
here
asked
if
you
not
going
to
give
a
sermon
come
down
here
with
me
now
i
can
come
down
said
the
priest
perhaps
he
regretted
having
shouted
at
as
he
took
down
the
lamp
from
its
hook
he
said
to
start
off
with
i
had
to
speak
to
you
from
a
distance
otherwise
i
too
easily
influenced
and
forget
my
duty
waited
for
him
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
while
he
was
still
on
one
of
the
higher
steps
as
he
came
down
them
the
priest
reached
out
his
hand
for
to
shake
can
you
spare
me
a
little
of
your
time
asked
as
much
time
as
you
need
said
the
priest
and
passed
him
the
little
lamp
for
him
to
carry
even
at
close
distance
the
priest
did
not
lose
a
certain
solemnity
that
seemed
to
be
part
of
his
character
you
are
very
friendly
towards
me
said
as
they
walked
up
and
down
beside
each
other
in
the
darkness
of
one
of
the
side
naves
that
makes
you
an
exception
among
all
those
who
belong
to
the
court
i
can
trust
you
more
than
any
of
the
others
i
seen
i
can
speak
openly
with
you
do
fool
yourself
said
the
priest
how
would
i
be
fooling
myself
asked
you
fool
yourself
in
the
court
said
the
priest
it
talks
about
this
in
the
opening
paragraphs
to
the
law
in
front
of
the
law
there
is
a
doorkeeper
a
man
from
the
countryside
comes
up
to
the
door
and
asks
for
entry
but
the
doorkeeper
says
he
ca
let
him
in
to
the
law
right
now
the
man
thinks
about
this
and
then
he
asks
if
he
be
able
to
go
in
later
on
possible
says
the
doorkeeper
not
now
the
gateway
to
the
law
is
open
as
it
always
is
and
the
doorkeeper
has
stepped
to
one
side
so
the
man
bends
over
to
try
and
see
in
when
the
doorkeeper
notices
this
he
laughs
and
says
you
tempted
give
it
a
try
try
and
go
in
even
though
i
say
you
ca
careful
though
i
powerful
and
i
only
the
lowliest
of
all
the
doormen
but
there
a
doorkeeper
for
each
of
the
rooms
and
each
of
them
is
more
powerful
than
the
last
it
more
than
i
can
stand
just
to
look
at
the
third
one
the
man
from
the
country
had
not
expected
difficulties
like
this
the
law
was
supposed
to
be
accessible
for
anyone
at
any
time
he
thinks
but
now
he
looks
more
closely
at
the
doorkeeper
in
his
fur
coat
sees
his
big
hooked
nose
his
long
thin
and
he
decides
it
better
to
wait
until
he
has
permission
to
enter
the
doorkeeper
gives
him
a
stool
and
lets
him
sit
down
to
one
side
of
the
gate
he
sits
there
for
days
and
years
he
tries
to
be
allowed
in
time
and
again
and
tires
the
doorkeeper
with
his
requests
the
doorkeeper
often
questions
him
asking
about
where
from
and
many
other
things
but
these
are
disinterested
questions
such
as
great
men
ask
and
he
always
ends
up
by
telling
him
he
still
let
him
in
the
man
had
come
well
equipped
for
his
journey
and
uses
everything
however
valuable
to
bribe
the
doorkeeper
he
accepts
everything
but
as
he
does
so
he
says
only
accept
this
so
that
you
do
think
there
anything
you
failed
to
do
over
many
years
the
man
watches
the
doorkeeper
almost
without
a
break
he
forgets
about
the
other
doormen
and
begins
to
think
this
one
is
the
only
thing
stopping
him
from
gaining
access
to
the
law
over
the
first
few
years
he
curses
his
unhappy
condition
out
loud
but
later
as
he
becomes
old
he
just
grumbles
to
himself
he
becomes
senile
and
as
he
has
come
to
know
even
the
fleas
in
the
doorkeeper
fur
collar
over
the
years
that
he
has
been
studying
him
he
even
asks
them
to
help
him
and
change
the
doorkeeper
mind
finally
his
eyes
grow
dim
and
he
no
longer
knows
whether
it
really
getting
darker
or
just
his
eyes
that
are
deceiving
him
but
he
seems
now
to
see
an
inextinguishable
light
begin
to
shine
from
the
darkness
behind
the
door
he
does
have
long
to
live
now
just
before
he
dies
he
brings
together
all
his
experience
from
all
this
time
into
one
question
which
he
has
still
never
put
to
the
doorkeeper
he
beckons
to
him
as
he
no
longer
able
to
raise
his
stiff
body
the
doorkeeper
has
to
bend
over
deeply
as
the
difference
in
their
sizes
has
changed
very
much
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
man
is
it
you
want
to
know
now
asks
the
doorkeeper
insatiable
wants
access
to
the
law
says
the
man
come
over
all
these
years
one
but
me
has
asked
to
be
let
in
the
doorkeeper
can
see
the
come
to
his
end
his
hearing
has
faded
and
so
so
that
he
can
be
heard
he
shouts
to
him
else
could
have
got
in
this
way
as
this
entrance
was
meant
only
for
you
now
i
go
and
close
it
so
the
doorkeeper
cheated
the
man
said
immediately
who
had
been
captivated
by
the
story
do
be
too
quick
said
the
priest
do
take
somebody
else
opinion
without
checking
it
i
told
you
the
story
exactly
as
it
was
written
there
nothing
in
there
about
cheating
but
it
quite
clear
said
and
your
first
interpretation
of
it
was
quite
correct
the
doorkeeper
gave
him
the
information
that
would
release
him
only
when
it
could
be
of
no
more
use
he
did
ask
him
before
that
said
the
priest
and
forget
he
was
only
a
doorkeeper
and
as
doorkeeper
he
did
his
duty
what
makes
you
think
he
did
his
duty
asked
he
did
it
might
have
been
his
duty
to
keep
everyone
else
away
but
this
man
is
who
the
door
was
intended
for
and
he
ought
to
have
let
him
in
you
not
paying
enough
attention
to
what
was
written
and
you
changing
the
story
said
the
priest
according
to
the
story
there
are
two
important
things
that
the
doorkeeper
explains
about
access
to
the
law
one
at
the
beginning
one
at
the
end
at
one
place
he
says
he
allow
him
in
now
and
at
the
other
he
says
this
entrance
was
intended
for
him
alone
if
one
of
the
statements
contradicted
the
other
you
would
be
right
and
the
doorkeeper
would
have
cheated
the
man
from
the
country
but
there
is
no
contradiction
on
the
contrary
the
first
statement
even
hints
at
the
second
you
could
almost
say
the
doorkeeper
went
beyond
his
duty
in
that
he
offered
the
man
some
prospect
of
being
admitted
in
the
future
throughout
the
story
his
duty
seems
to
have
been
merely
to
turn
the
man
away
and
there
are
many
commentators
who
are
surprised
that
the
doorkeeper
offered
this
hint
at
all
as
he
seems
to
love
exactitude
and
keeps
strict
guard
over
his
position
he
stays
at
his
post
for
many
years
and
does
close
the
gate
until
the
very
end
he
very
conscious
of
the
importance
of
his
service
as
he
says
powerful
he
has
respect
for
his
superiors
as
he
says
only
the
lowliest
of
the
doormen
he
not
talkative
as
through
all
these
years
the
only
questions
he
asks
are
he
not
corruptible
as
when
he
offered
a
gift
he
says
only
accept
this
so
that
you
do
think
there
anything
you
failed
to
do
as
far
as
fulfilling
his
duty
goes
he
can
be
neither
ruffled
nor
begged
as
it
says
about
the
man
that
tires
the
doorkeeper
with
his
requests
even
his
external
appearance
suggests
a
pedantic
character
the
big
hooked
nose
and
the
long
thin
black
how
could
any
doorkeeper
be
more
faithful
to
his
duty
but
in
the
character
there
are
also
other
features
which
might
be
very
useful
for
those
who
seek
entry
to
the
law
and
when
he
hinted
at
some
possibility
in
the
future
it
always
seemed
to
make
it
clear
that
he
might
even
go
beyond
his
duty
there
no
denying
he
a
little
simple
minded
and
that
makes
him
a
little
conceited
even
if
all
he
said
about
his
power
and
the
power
of
the
other
doorkeepers
and
how
not
even
he
could
bear
the
sight
of
them
i
say
even
if
all
these
assertions
are
right
the
way
he
makes
them
shows
that
he
too
simple
and
arrogant
to
understand
properly
the
commentators
say
about
this
that
understanding
of
a
matter
and
a
misunderstanding
of
the
same
matter
are
not
mutually
exclusive
whether
they
right
or
not
you
have
to
concede
that
his
simplicity
and
arrogance
however
little
they
show
do
weaken
his
function
of
guarding
the
entrance
they
are
defects
in
the
character
you
also
have
to
consider
that
the
doorkeeper
seems
to
be
friendly
by
nature
he
is
always
just
an
official
he
makes
a
joke
right
at
the
beginning
in
that
he
invites
the
man
to
enter
at
the
same
time
as
maintaining
the
ban
on
his
entering
and
then
he
does
send
him
away
but
gives
him
as
it
says
in
the
text
a
stool
to
sit
on
and
lets
him
stay
by
the
side
of
the
door
the
patience
with
which
he
puts
up
with
the
man
requests
through
all
these
years
the
little
questioning
sessions
accepting
the
gifts
his
politeness
when
he
puts
up
with
the
man
cursing
his
fate
even
though
it
was
the
doorkeeper
who
caused
that
fate
all
these
things
seem
to
want
to
arouse
our
sympathy
not
every
doorkeeper
would
have
behaved
in
the
same
way
and
finally
he
lets
the
man
beckon
him
and
he
bends
deep
down
to
him
so
that
he
can
put
his
last
question
there
no
more
than
some
slight
impatience
the
doorkeeper
knows
everything
come
to
its
end
shown
in
the
words
insatiable
there
are
many
commentators
who
go
even
further
in
explaining
it
in
this
way
and
think
the
words
insatiable
are
an
expression
of
friendly
admiration
albeit
with
some
condescension
however
you
look
at
it
the
figure
of
the
doorkeeper
comes
out
differently
from
how
you
might
think
you
know
the
story
better
than
i
do
and
you
known
it
for
longer
said
they
were
silent
for
a
while
and
then
said
so
you
think
the
man
was
not
cheated
do
you
do
get
me
wrong
said
the
priest
i
just
pointing
out
the
different
opinions
about
it
you
should
pay
too
much
attention
to
people
opinions
the
text
can
not
be
altered
and
the
various
opinions
are
often
no
more
than
an
expression
of
despair
over
it
there
even
one
opinion
which
says
it
the
doorkeeper
who
been
cheated
that
does
seem
to
take
things
too
far
said
how
can
they
argue
the
doorkeeper
has
been
cheated
their
argument
answered
the
priest
is
based
on
the
simplicity
of
the
doorkeeper
they
say
the
doorkeeper
does
know
the
inside
of
the
law
only
the
way
into
it
where
he
just
walks
up
and
down
they
see
his
ideas
of
what
inside
the
law
as
rather
childish
and
suppose
he
afraid
himself
of
what
he
wants
to
make
the
man
frightened
of
yes
he
more
afraid
of
it
than
the
man
as
the
man
wants
nothing
but
to
go
inside
the
law
even
after
he
heard
about
the
terrible
doormen
there
in
contrast
to
the
doorkeeper
who
does
want
to
go
in
or
at
least
we
do
hear
anything
about
it
on
the
other
hand
there
are
those
who
say
he
must
have
already
been
inside
the
law
as
he
has
been
taken
on
into
its
service
and
that
could
only
have
been
done
inside
that
can
be
countered
by
supposing
he
could
have
been
given
the
job
of
doorkeeper
by
somebody
calling
out
from
inside
and
that
he
ca
have
gone
very
far
inside
as
he
could
bear
the
sight
of
the
third
doorkeeper
nor
through
all
those
years
does
the
story
say
the
doorkeeper
told
the
man
anything
about
the
inside
other
than
his
comment
about
the
other
doorkeepers
he
could
have
been
forbidden
to
do
so
but
he
has
said
anything
about
that
either
all
this
seems
to
show
he
does
know
anything
about
what
the
inside
looks
like
or
what
it
means
and
that
that
why
he
being
deceived
but
he
also
being
deceived
by
the
man
from
the
country
as
he
this
subordinate
and
does
know
it
there
a
lot
to
indicate
that
he
treats
the
man
as
his
subordinate
i
expect
you
remember
but
those
who
hold
this
view
would
say
it
very
clear
that
he
really
is
his
subordinate
above
all
the
free
man
is
superior
to
the
man
who
has
to
serve
another
now
the
man
really
is
free
he
can
go
wherever
he
wants
the
only
thing
forbidden
to
him
is
entry
into
the
law
and
more
there
only
one
man
forbidding
him
to
do
so
the
doorkeeper
if
he
takes
the
stool
and
sits
down
beside
the
door
and
stays
there
all
his
life
he
does
this
of
his
own
free
will
there
nothing
in
the
story
to
say
he
was
forced
to
do
it
on
the
other
hand
the
doorkeeper
is
kept
to
his
post
by
his
employment
he
not
allowed
to
go
away
from
it
and
it
seems
he
not
allowed
to
go
inside
either
not
even
if
he
wanted
to
also
although
he
in
the
service
of
the
law
he
only
there
for
this
one
entrance
therefore
he
there
only
in
the
service
of
this
one
man
who
the
door
intended
for
this
is
another
way
in
which
he
his
subordinate
we
can
take
it
that
he
been
performing
this
somewhat
empty
service
for
many
years
through
the
whole
of
a
man
life
as
it
says
that
a
man
will
come
that
means
someone
old
enough
to
be
a
man
that
means
the
doorkeeper
will
have
to
wait
a
long
time
before
his
function
is
fulfilled
he
will
have
to
wait
for
as
long
as
the
man
liked
who
came
to
the
door
of
his
own
free
will
even
the
end
of
the
doorkeeper
service
is
determined
by
when
the
man
life
ends
so
the
doorkeeper
remains
his
subordinate
right
to
the
end
and
it
pointed
out
repeatedly
that
the
doorkeeper
seems
to
know
nothing
of
any
of
this
although
this
is
not
seen
as
anything
remarkable
as
those
who
hold
this
view
see
the
doorkeeper
as
deluded
in
a
way
that
far
worse
a
way
that
to
do
with
his
service
at
the
end
speaking
about
the
entrance
he
says
i
go
and
close
it
although
at
the
beginning
of
the
story
it
says
the
door
to
the
law
is
open
as
it
always
is
but
if
always
open
always
that
means
it
open
independently
of
the
lifespan
of
the
man
it
intended
for
and
not
even
the
doorkeeper
will
be
able
to
close
it
there
are
various
opinions
about
this
some
say
the
doorkeeper
was
only
answering
a
question
or
showing
his
devotion
to
duty
or
just
when
the
man
was
in
his
last
moments
the
doorkeeper
wanted
to
cause
him
regret
and
sorrow
there
are
many
who
agree
that
he
would
be
able
to
close
the
door
they
even
believe
at
the
end
at
least
the
doorkeeper
is
aware
deep
down
that
he
the
subordinate
as
the
man
sees
the
light
that
shines
out
of
the
entry
to
the
law
whereas
the
doorkeeper
would
probably
have
his
back
to
it
and
says
nothing
at
all
to
show
there
been
any
change
that
is
well
substantiated
said
who
had
been
repeating
some
parts
of
the
priest
explanation
to
himself
in
a
whisper
it
is
well
substantiated
and
now
i
too
think
the
doorkeeper
must
have
been
deceived
although
that
does
not
mean
i
abandoned
what
i
thought
earlier
as
the
two
versions
are
to
some
extent
not
incompatible
not
clear
whether
the
doorkeeper
sees
clearly
or
is
deceived
i
said
the
man
had
been
cheated
if
the
doorkeeper
understands
clearly
then
there
could
be
some
doubt
about
it
but
if
the
doorkeeper
has
been
deceived
then
the
man
is
bound
to
believe
the
same
thing
that
would
mean
the
doorkeeper
is
not
a
cheat
but
so
that
he
ought
to
be
dismissed
from
his
job
immediately
if
the
doorkeeper
is
mistaken
it
will
do
him
no
harm
but
the
man
will
be
harmed
immensely
there
you
found
another
opinion
said
the
priest
as
there
are
many
who
say
the
story
does
give
anyone
the
right
to
judge
the
doorkeeper
however
he
might
seem
to
us
he
is
still
in
the
service
of
the
law
so
he
belongs
to
the
law
so
he
beyond
what
man
has
a
right
to
judge
in
this
case
we
ca
believe
the
doorkeeper
is
the
man
subordinate
even
if
he
has
to
stay
at
the
entrance
into
the
law
his
service
makes
him
incomparably
more
than
if
he
lived
freely
in
the
world
the
man
has
come
to
the
law
for
the
first
time
and
the
doorkeeper
is
already
there
he
been
given
his
position
by
the
law
to
doubt
his
worth
would
be
to
doubt
the
law
i
ca
say
i
in
complete
agreement
with
this
view
said
shaking
his
head
as
if
you
accept
it
you
have
to
accept
that
everything
said
by
the
doorkeeper
is
true
but
you
already
explained
very
fully
that
that
not
possible
no
said
the
priest
you
do
need
to
accept
everything
as
true
you
only
have
to
accept
it
as
necessary
depressing
view
said
the
lie
made
into
the
rule
of
the
world
said
that
as
if
it
were
his
final
word
but
it
was
not
his
conclusion
he
was
too
tired
to
think
about
all
the
ramifications
of
the
story
and
the
sort
of
thoughts
they
led
him
into
were
not
familiar
to
him
unrealistic
things
things
better
suited
for
officials
of
the
court
to
discuss
than
for
him
the
simple
story
had
lost
its
shape
he
wanted
to
shake
it
off
and
the
priest
who
now
felt
quite
compassionate
allowed
this
and
accepted
remarks
without
comment
even
though
his
view
was
certainly
very
different
from
in
silence
they
carried
on
walking
for
some
time
stayed
close
beside
the
priest
without
knowing
where
he
was
the
lamp
in
his
hand
had
long
since
gone
out
once
just
in
front
of
him
he
thought
he
could
see
the
statue
of
a
saint
by
the
glitter
of
the
silver
on
it
although
it
quickly
disappeared
back
into
the
darkness
so
that
he
would
not
remain
entirely
dependent
on
the
priest
asked
him
now
near
the
main
entrance
are
we
no
said
the
priest
we
a
long
way
from
it
do
you
already
want
to
go
had
not
thought
of
going
until
then
but
he
immediately
said
yes
certainly
i
have
to
go
i
the
chief
clerk
in
a
bank
and
there
are
people
waiting
for
me
i
only
came
here
to
show
a
foreign
business
contact
round
the
cathedral
alright
said
the
priest
offering
him
his
hand
go
then
but
i
ca
find
my
way
round
in
this
darkness
by
myself
said
go
to
your
left
as
far
as
the
wall
said
the
priest
then
continue
alongside
the
wall
without
leaving
it
and
you
find
a
way
out
the
priest
had
only
gone
a
few
paces
from
him
but
was
already
shouting
loudly
please
wait
i
waiting
said
the
priest
is
there
anything
else
you
want
from
me
asked
no
said
the
priest
you
were
so
friendly
to
me
earlier
on
said
and
you
explained
everything
but
now
you
abandon
me
as
if
i
were
nothing
to
you
you
have
to
go
said
the
priest
well
yes
said
you
need
to
understand
that
first
you
need
to
understand
who
i
am
said
the
priest
you
the
prison
chaplain
said
and
went
closer
to
the
priest
it
was
not
so
important
for
him
to
go
straight
back
to
the
bank
as
he
had
made
out
he
could
very
well
stay
where
he
was
so
that
means
i
belong
to
the
court
said
the
priest
so
why
would
i
want
anything
from
you
the
court
does
want
anything
from
you
it
accepts
you
when
you
come
and
it
lets
you
go
when
you
leave
chapter
ten
end
the
evening
before
birthday
it
was
about
nine
in
the
evening
the
time
when
the
streets
were
quiet
two
men
came
to
where
he
lived
in
frock
coats
pale
and
fat
wearing
top
hats
that
looked
like
they
could
not
be
taken
off
their
heads
after
some
brief
formalities
at
the
door
of
the
flat
when
they
first
arrived
the
same
formalities
were
repeated
at
greater
length
at
door
he
had
not
been
notified
they
would
be
coming
but
sat
in
a
chair
near
the
door
dressed
in
black
as
they
were
and
slowly
put
on
new
gloves
which
stretched
tightly
over
his
fingers
and
behaved
as
if
he
were
expecting
visitors
he
immediately
stood
up
and
looked
at
the
gentlemen
inquisitively
you
come
for
me
then
have
you
he
asked
the
gentlemen
nodded
one
of
them
indicated
the
other
with
the
top
hand
now
in
his
hand
told
them
he
had
been
expecting
a
different
visitor
he
went
to
the
window
and
looked
once
more
down
at
the
dark
street
most
of
the
windows
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
were
also
dark
already
many
of
them
had
the
curtains
closed
in
one
of
the
windows
on
the
same
floor
where
there
was
a
light
on
two
small
children
could
be
seen
playing
with
each
other
inside
a
playpen
unable
to
move
from
where
they
were
reaching
out
for
each
other
with
their
little
hands
some
ancient
unimportant
actors
that
what
they
sent
for
me
said
to
himself
and
looked
round
once
again
to
confirm
this
to
himself
they
want
to
sort
me
out
as
cheaply
as
they
can
suddenly
turned
round
to
face
the
two
men
and
asked
what
theatre
do
you
play
in
theatre
asked
one
of
the
gentlemen
turning
to
the
other
for
assistance
and
pulling
in
the
corners
of
his
mouth
the
other
made
a
gesture
like
someone
who
was
dumb
as
if
he
were
struggling
with
some
organism
causing
him
trouble
you
not
properly
prepared
to
answer
questions
said
and
went
to
fetch
his
hat
as
soon
as
they
were
on
the
stairs
the
gentlemen
wanted
to
take
arms
but
said
wait
till
we
in
the
street
i
not
but
they
waited
only
until
the
front
door
before
they
took
his
arms
in
a
way
that
had
never
experienced
before
they
kept
their
shoulders
close
behind
his
did
not
turn
their
arms
in
but
twisted
them
around
the
entire
length
of
arms
and
took
hold
of
his
hands
with
a
grasp
that
was
formal
experienced
and
could
not
be
resisted
was
held
stiff
and
upright
between
them
they
formed
now
a
single
unit
so
that
if
any
one
of
them
had
been
knocked
down
all
of
them
must
have
fallen
they
formed
a
unit
of
the
sort
that
normally
can
be
formed
only
by
matter
that
is
lifeless
whenever
they
passed
under
a
lamp
tried
to
see
his
companions
more
clearly
as
far
as
was
possible
when
they
were
pressed
so
close
together
as
in
the
dim
light
of
his
room
this
had
been
hardly
possible
maybe
they
tenors
he
thought
as
he
saw
their
big
double
chins
the
cleanliness
of
their
faces
disgusted
him
he
could
see
the
hands
that
cleaned
them
passing
over
the
corners
of
their
eyes
rubbing
at
their
upper
lips
scratching
out
the
creases
on
those
chins
when
noticed
that
he
stopped
which
meant
the
others
had
to
stop
too
they
were
at
the
edge
of
an
open
square
devoid
of
people
but
decorated
with
flower
beds
why
did
they
send
you
of
all
people
he
cried
out
more
a
shout
than
a
question
the
two
gentleman
clearly
knew
no
answer
to
give
they
waited
their
free
arms
hanging
down
like
nurses
when
the
patient
needs
to
rest
i
will
go
no
further
said
as
if
to
see
what
would
happen
the
gentlemen
did
not
need
to
make
any
answer
it
was
enough
that
they
did
not
loosen
their
grip
on
and
tried
to
move
him
on
but
resisted
them
i
soon
have
no
need
of
much
strength
i
use
all
of
it
now
he
thought
he
thought
of
the
flies
that
tear
their
legs
off
struggling
to
get
free
of
the
flypaper
these
gentleman
will
have
some
hard
work
to
do
just
then
miss
b√ºrstner
came
up
into
the
square
in
front
of
them
from
the
steps
leading
from
a
small
street
at
a
lower
level
it
was
not
certain
that
it
was
her
although
the
similarity
was
of
course
great
but
it
did
not
matter
to
whether
it
was
certainly
her
anyway
he
just
became
suddenly
aware
that
there
was
no
point
in
his
resistance
there
would
be
nothing
heroic
about
it
if
he
resisted
if
he
now
caused
trouble
for
these
gentlemen
if
in
defending
himself
he
sought
to
enjoy
his
last
glimmer
of
life
he
started
walking
which
pleased
the
gentlemen
and
some
of
their
pleasure
conveyed
itself
to
him
now
they
permitted
him
to
decide
which
direction
they
took
and
he
decided
to
take
the
direction
that
followed
the
young
woman
in
front
of
them
not
so
much
because
he
wanted
to
catch
up
with
her
nor
even
because
he
wanted
to
keep
her
in
sight
for
as
long
as
possible
but
only
so
that
he
would
not
forget
the
reproach
she
represented
for
him
the
only
thing
i
can
do
now
he
said
to
himself
and
his
thought
was
confirmed
by
the
equal
length
of
his
own
steps
with
the
steps
of
the
two
others
the
only
thing
i
can
do
now
is
keep
my
common
sense
and
do
what
needed
right
till
the
end
i
always
wanted
to
go
at
the
world
and
try
and
do
too
much
and
even
to
do
it
for
something
that
was
not
too
cheap
that
was
wrong
of
me
should
i
now
show
them
i
learned
nothing
from
facing
trial
for
a
year
should
i
go
out
like
someone
stupid
should
i
let
anyone
say
after
i
gone
that
at
the
start
of
the
proceedings
i
wanted
to
end
them
and
that
now
that
they
ended
i
want
to
start
them
again
i
do
want
anyone
to
say
that
i
grateful
they
sent
these
unspeaking
uncomprehending
men
to
go
with
me
on
this
journey
and
that
it
been
left
up
to
me
to
say
what
necessary
meanwhile
the
young
woman
had
turned
off
into
a
side
street
but
could
do
without
her
now
and
let
his
companions
lead
him
all
three
of
them
now
in
complete
agreement
went
over
a
bridge
in
the
light
of
the
moon
the
two
gentlemen
were
willing
to
yield
to
each
little
movement
made
by
as
he
moved
slightly
towards
the
edge
and
directed
the
group
in
that
direction
as
a
single
unit
the
moonlight
glittered
and
quivered
in
the
water
which
divided
itself
around
a
small
island
covered
in
a
mass
of
foliage
and
trees
and
bushes
beneath
them
now
invisible
there
were
gravel
paths
with
comfortable
benches
where
had
stretched
himself
out
on
many
summer
days
i
did
actually
want
to
stop
here
he
said
to
his
companions
shamed
by
their
compliance
with
his
wishes
behind
back
one
of
them
seemed
to
quietly
criticise
the
other
for
the
misunderstanding
about
stopping
and
then
they
went
on
the
went
on
up
through
several
streets
where
policemen
were
walking
or
standing
here
and
there
some
in
the
distance
and
then
some
very
close
one
of
them
with
a
bushy
moustache
his
hand
on
the
grip
of
his
sword
seemed
to
have
some
purpose
in
approaching
the
group
which
was
hardly
unsuspicious
the
two
gentlemen
stopped
the
policeman
seemed
about
to
open
his
mouth
and
then
drove
his
group
forcefully
forward
several
times
he
looked
back
cautiously
to
see
if
the
policeman
was
following
but
when
they
had
a
corner
between
themselves
and
the
policeman
began
to
run
and
the
two
gentlemen
despite
being
seriously
short
of
breath
had
to
run
with
him
in
this
way
they
quickly
left
the
built
up
area
and
found
themselves
in
the
fields
which
in
this
part
of
town
began
almost
without
any
transition
zone
there
was
a
quarry
empty
and
abandoned
near
a
building
which
was
still
like
those
in
the
city
here
the
men
stopped
perhaps
because
this
had
always
been
their
destination
or
perhaps
because
they
were
too
exhausted
to
run
any
further
here
they
released
their
hold
on
who
just
waited
in
silence
and
took
their
top
hats
off
while
they
looked
round
the
quarry
and
wiped
the
sweat
off
their
brows
with
their
handkerchiefs
the
moonlight
lay
everywhere
with
the
natural
peace
that
is
granted
to
no
other
light
after
exchanging
a
few
courtesies
about
who
was
to
carry
out
the
next
tasks
the
gentlemen
did
not
seem
to
have
been
allocated
specific
functions
one
of
them
went
to
and
took
his
coat
his
waistcoat
and
finally
his
shirt
off
him
made
an
involuntary
shiver
at
which
the
gentleman
gave
him
a
gentle
reassuring
tap
on
the
back
then
he
carefully
folded
the
things
up
as
if
they
would
still
be
needed
even
if
not
in
the
near
future
he
did
not
want
to
expose
to
the
chilly
night
air
without
moving
though
so
he
took
him
under
the
arm
and
walked
up
and
down
with
him
a
little
way
while
the
other
gentleman
looked
round
the
quarry
for
a
suitable
place
when
he
had
found
it
he
made
a
sign
and
the
other
gentleman
escorted
him
there
it
was
near
the
rockface
there
was
a
stone
lying
there
that
had
broken
loose
the
gentlemen
sat
down
on
the
ground
leant
him
against
the
stone
and
settled
his
head
down
on
the
top
of
it
despite
all
the
effort
they
went
to
and
despite
all
the
shown
by
his
demeanour
seemed
very
forced
and
hard
to
believe
so
one
of
the
gentlemen
asked
the
other
to
grant
him
a
short
time
while
he
put
in
position
by
himself
but
even
that
did
nothing
to
make
it
better
in
the
end
they
left
in
a
position
that
was
far
from
the
best
of
the
ones
they
had
tried
so
far
then
one
of
the
gentlemen
opened
his
frock
coat
and
from
a
sheath
hanging
on
a
belt
stretched
across
his
waistcoat
he
withdrew
a
long
thin
butcher
knife
which
he
held
up
in
the
light
to
test
its
sharpness
the
repulsive
courtesies
began
once
again
one
of
them
passed
the
knife
over
to
the
other
who
then
passed
it
back
over
to
the
first
now
knew
it
would
be
his
duty
to
take
the
knife
as
it
passed
from
hand
to
hand
above
him
and
thrust
it
into
himself
but
he
did
not
do
it
instead
he
twisted
his
neck
which
was
still
free
and
looked
around
he
was
not
able
to
show
his
full
worth
was
not
able
to
take
all
the
work
from
the
official
bodies
he
lacked
the
rest
of
the
strength
he
needed
and
this
final
shortcoming
was
the
fault
of
whoever
had
denied
it
to
him
as
he
looked
round
he
saw
the
top
floor
of
the
building
next
to
the
quarry
he
saw
how
a
light
flickered
on
and
the
two
halves
of
a
window
opened
out
somebody
made
weak
and
thin
by
the
height
and
the
distance
leant
suddenly
far
out
from
it
and
stretched
his
arms
out
even
further
who
was
that
a
friend
a
good
person
somebody
who
was
taking
part
somebody
who
wanted
to
help
was
he
alone
was
it
everyone
would
anyone
help
were
there
objections
that
had
been
forgotten
there
must
have
been
some
the
logic
can
not
be
refuted
but
someone
who
wants
to
live
will
not
resist
it
where
was
the
judge
never
seen
where
was
the
high
court
he
had
never
reached
he
raised
both
hands
and
spread
out
all
his
fingers
but
the
hands
of
one
of
the
gentleman
were
laid
on
throat
while
the
other
pushed
the
knife
deep
into
his
heart
and
twisted
it
there
twice
as
his
eyesight
failed
saw
the
two
gentlemen
cheek
by
cheek
close
in
front
of
his
face
watching
the
result
like
a
dog
he
said
it
was
as
if
the
shame
of
it
should
outlive
him
