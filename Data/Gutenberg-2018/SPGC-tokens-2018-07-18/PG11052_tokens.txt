the
custom
of
the
country
i
undine
spragg
how
can
you
her
mother
wailed
raising
a
hand
heavy
with
rings
to
defend
the
note
which
a
languid
had
just
brought
in
but
her
defence
was
as
feeble
as
her
protest
and
she
continued
to
smile
on
her
visitor
while
miss
spragg
with
a
turn
of
her
quick
young
fingers
possessed
herself
of
the
missive
and
withdrew
to
the
window
to
read
it
i
guess
it
meant
for
me
she
merely
threw
over
her
shoulder
at
her
mother
did
you
ever
mrs
heeny
spragg
murmured
with
deprecating
pride
heeny
a
stout
person
in
a
waterproof
her
rusty
veil
thrown
back
and
a
shabby
alligator
bag
at
her
feet
followed
the
mother
glance
with
approval
i
never
met
with
a
lovelier
form
she
agreed
answering
the
spirit
rather
than
the
letter
of
her
hostess
enquiry
spragg
and
her
visitor
were
enthroned
in
two
heavy
gilt
armchairs
in
one
of
the
private
of
the
hotel
stentorian
the
spragg
rooms
were
known
as
one
of
the
looey
suites
and
the
walls
above
their
wainscoting
of
mahogany
were
hung
with
damask
and
adorned
with
oval
portraits
of
marie
antoinette
and
the
princess
de
lamballe
in
the
centre
of
the
florid
carpet
a
gilt
table
with
a
top
of
mexican
onyx
sustained
a
palm
in
a
gilt
basket
tied
with
a
pink
bow
but
for
this
ornament
and
a
copy
of
the
hound
of
the
baskervilles
which
lay
beside
it
the
room
showed
no
traces
of
human
use
and
spragg
herself
wore
as
complete
an
air
of
detachment
as
if
she
had
been
a
wax
figure
in
a
her
attire
was
fashionable
enough
to
justify
such
a
post
and
her
pale
face
with
puffy
and
drooping
mouth
suggested
a
wax
figure
which
had
run
to
heeny
in
comparison
had
a
reassuring
look
of
solidity
and
reality
the
planting
of
her
firm
black
bulk
in
its
chair
and
the
grasp
of
her
broad
red
hands
on
the
gilt
arms
bespoke
an
organized
and
activity
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
heeny
was
a
society
manicure
and
masseuse
toward
spragg
and
her
daughter
she
filled
the
double
role
of
manipulator
and
friend
and
it
was
in
the
latter
capacity
that
her
day
task
ended
she
had
dropped
in
for
a
moment
to
cheer
up
the
lonely
ladies
of
the
stentorian
the
young
girl
whose
form
had
won
heeny
professional
commendation
suddenly
shifted
its
lovely
lines
as
she
turned
back
from
the
window
here
you
can
have
it
after
all
she
said
crumpling
the
note
and
tossing
it
with
a
contemptuous
gesture
into
her
mother
lap
why
is
it
from
mr
popple
spragg
exclaimed
unguardedly
no
it
is
what
made
you
think
i
thought
it
was
snapped
her
daughter
but
the
next
instant
she
added
with
an
outbreak
of
childish
disappointment
it
only
from
marvell
sister
at
least
she
says
she
his
sister
spragg
with
a
puzzled
frown
groped
for
her
among
the
jet
fringes
of
her
front
heeny
small
blue
eyes
shot
out
sparks
of
curiosity
marvell
what
marvell
is
that
the
girl
explained
languidly
a
little
fellow
i
think
popple
said
his
name
was
ralph
while
her
mother
continued
undine
met
them
both
last
night
at
that
party
downstairs
and
from
something
popple
said
to
her
about
going
to
one
of
the
new
plays
she
thought
how
on
earth
do
you
know
what
i
thought
undine
flashed
back
her
grey
eyes
darting
warnings
at
her
mother
under
their
straight
black
brows
why
you
said
you
thought
spragg
began
reproachfully
but
heeny
heedless
of
their
bickerings
was
pursuing
her
own
train
of
thought
what
popple
claud
walsingham
popple
the
portrait
painter
yes
i
suppose
so
he
said
he
like
to
paint
me
mabel
lipscomb
introduced
him
i
do
care
if
i
never
see
him
again
the
girl
said
bathed
in
angry
pink
do
you
know
him
mrs
heeny
spragg
enquired
i
should
say
i
did
i
manicured
him
for
his
first
society
portrait
a
of
harmon
b
driscoll
heeny
smiled
indulgently
on
her
hearers
i
know
everybody
if
they
do
know
me
they
ai
in
it
and
claud
walsingham
popple
in
it
but
he
ai
nearly
as
in
it
she
continued
judicially
as
ralph
marvell
the
little
fellow
as
you
call
him
undine
spragg
at
the
word
swept
round
on
the
speaker
with
one
of
the
quick
turns
that
revealed
her
youthful
flexibility
she
was
always
doubling
and
twisting
on
herself
and
every
movement
she
made
seemed
to
start
at
the
nape
of
her
neck
just
below
the
lifted
roll
of
hair
and
flow
without
a
break
through
her
whole
slim
length
to
the
tips
of
her
fingers
and
the
points
of
her
slender
restless
feet
why
do
you
know
the
marvells
are
they
stylish
she
asked
heeny
gave
the
discouraged
gesture
of
a
pedagogue
who
has
vainly
striven
to
implant
the
rudiments
of
knowledge
in
a
rebellious
mind
why
undine
spragg
i
told
you
all
about
them
time
and
again
his
mother
was
a
dagonet
they
live
with
old
urban
dagonet
down
in
washington
square
to
spragg
this
conveyed
even
less
than
to
her
daughter
down
there
why
do
they
live
with
somebody
else
have
they
got
the
means
to
have
a
home
of
their
own
undine
perceptions
were
more
rapid
and
she
fixed
her
eyes
searchingly
on
heeny
do
you
mean
to
say
marvell
as
swell
as
mr
popple
as
swell
why
claud
walsingham
popple
ai
in
the
same
class
with
him
the
girl
was
upon
her
mother
with
a
spring
snatching
and
smoothing
out
the
crumpled
note
laura
fairford
is
that
the
sister
name
henley
fairford
yes
what
does
she
write
about
undine
face
lit
up
as
if
a
shaft
of
sunset
had
struck
it
through
the
windows
of
the
stentorian
she
says
she
wants
me
to
dine
with
her
next
wednesday
is
it
queer
why
does
she
want
me
she
never
seen
me
her
tone
implied
that
she
had
long
been
accustomed
to
being
wanted
by
those
who
had
heeny
laughed
he
saw
you
did
he
who
ralph
marvell
why
of
course
he
did
popple
brought
him
to
the
party
here
last
night
well
there
you
are
when
a
young
man
in
society
wants
to
meet
a
girl
again
he
gets
his
sister
to
ask
her
undine
stared
at
her
incredulously
how
queer
but
they
have
all
got
sisters
have
they
it
must
be
fearfully
poky
for
the
ones
that
have
they
get
their
mothers
or
their
married
friends
said
heeny
omnisciently
married
gentlemen
enquired
spragg
slightly
shocked
but
genuinely
desirous
of
mastering
her
lesson
mercy
no
married
ladies
but
are
there
never
any
gentlemen
present
pursued
spragg
feeling
that
if
this
were
the
case
undine
would
certainly
be
disappointed
present
where
at
their
dinners
of
course
fairford
gives
the
smartest
little
dinners
in
town
there
was
an
account
of
one
she
gave
last
week
in
this
morning
town
talk
i
guess
it
right
here
among
my
clippings
heeny
swooping
down
on
her
bag
drew
from
it
a
handful
of
newspaper
cuttings
which
she
spread
on
her
ample
lap
and
proceeded
to
sort
with
a
moistened
forefinger
here
she
said
holding
one
of
the
slips
at
arm
length
and
throwing
back
her
head
she
read
in
a
slow
unpunctuated
chant
henley
fairford
gave
another
of
her
natty
little
dinners
last
wednesday
as
usual
it
was
smart
small
and
exclusive
and
there
was
much
gnashing
of
teeth
among
the
as
madame
olga
loukowska
gave
some
of
her
new
steppe
dances
after
dinner
that
the
french
for
new
dance
steps
heeny
concluded
thrusting
the
documents
back
into
her
bag
do
you
know
fairford
too
undine
asked
eagerly
while
spragg
impressed
but
anxious
for
facts
pursued
does
she
reside
on
fifth
avenue
no
she
has
a
little
house
in
street
down
beyond
park
avenue
the
ladies
faces
drooped
again
and
the
masseuse
went
on
promptly
but
they
glad
enough
to
have
her
in
the
big
houses
why
yes
i
know
her
she
said
addressing
herself
to
undine
i
mass
her
for
a
sprained
ankle
a
couple
of
years
ago
she
got
a
lovely
manner
but
no
conversation
some
of
my
patients
converse
exquisitely
heeny
added
with
discrimination
undine
was
brooding
over
the
note
it
is
written
to
mother
abner
spragg
i
never
saw
anything
so
funny
you
allow
your
daughter
to
dine
with
me
allow
is
fairford
peculiar
no
you
are
said
heeny
bluntly
do
you
know
it
the
thing
in
the
best
society
to
pretend
that
girls
ca
do
anything
without
their
mothers
permission
you
just
remember
that
undine
you
accept
invitations
from
gentlemen
without
you
say
you
got
to
ask
your
mother
first
mercy
but
how
mother
know
what
to
say
why
she
say
what
you
tell
her
to
of
course
you
better
tell
her
you
want
to
dine
with
fairford
heeny
added
humorously
as
she
gathered
her
waterproof
together
and
stooped
for
her
bag
have
i
got
to
write
the
note
then
spragg
asked
with
rising
agitation
heeny
reflected
why
no
i
guess
undine
can
write
it
as
if
it
was
from
you
fairford
do
know
your
writing
this
was
an
evident
relief
to
spragg
and
as
undine
swept
to
her
room
with
the
note
her
mother
sank
back
murmuring
plaintively
oh
do
go
yet
heeny
i
have
seen
a
human
being
all
day
and
i
ca
seem
to
find
anything
to
say
to
that
french
maid
heeny
looked
at
her
hostess
with
friendly
compassion
she
was
well
aware
that
she
was
the
only
bright
spot
on
spragg
horizon
since
the
spraggs
some
two
years
previously
had
moved
from
apex
city
to
new
york
they
had
made
little
progress
in
establishing
relations
with
their
new
environment
and
when
about
four
months
earlier
doctor
had
called
in
heeny
to
minister
professionally
to
his
patient
he
had
done
more
for
her
spirit
than
for
her
body
heeny
had
had
such
cases
before
she
knew
the
rich
helpless
family
stranded
in
lonely
splendour
in
a
sumptuous
west
side
hotel
with
a
father
compelled
to
seek
a
semblance
of
social
life
at
the
hotel
bar
and
a
mother
deprived
of
even
this
contact
with
her
kind
and
reduced
to
illness
by
boredom
and
inactivity
poor
spragg
had
done
her
own
washing
in
her
youth
but
since
her
rising
fortunes
had
made
this
occupation
unsuitable
she
had
sunk
into
the
relative
inertia
which
the
ladies
of
apex
city
regarded
as
one
of
the
prerogatives
of
affluence
at
apex
however
she
had
belonged
to
a
social
club
and
until
they
moved
to
the
mealey
house
had
been
kept
busy
by
the
incessant
struggle
with
domestic
cares
whereas
new
york
seemed
to
offer
no
field
for
any
form
of
activity
she
therefore
took
her
exercise
vicariously
with
heeny
help
and
heeny
knew
how
to
manipulate
her
imagination
as
well
as
her
muscles
it
was
heeny
who
peopled
the
solitude
of
the
long
ghostly
days
with
lively
anecdotes
of
the
van
degens
the
driscolls
the
chauncey
ellings
and
the
other
social
potentates
whose
least
doings
spragg
and
undine
had
followed
from
afar
in
the
apex
papers
and
who
had
come
to
seem
so
much
more
remote
since
only
the
width
of
the
central
park
divided
mother
and
daughter
from
their
olympian
portals
spragg
had
no
ambition
for
herself
she
seemed
to
have
transferred
her
whole
personality
to
her
child
but
she
was
passionately
resolved
that
undine
should
have
what
she
wanted
and
she
sometimes
fancied
that
heeny
who
crossed
those
sacred
thresholds
so
familiarly
might
some
day
gain
admission
for
undine
well
i
stay
a
little
mite
longer
if
you
want
and
supposing
i
was
to
rub
up
your
nails
while
we
talking
it
be
more
sociable
the
masseuse
suggested
lifting
her
bag
to
the
table
and
covering
its
shiny
onyx
surface
with
bottles
and
polishers
spragg
consentingly
slipped
the
rings
from
her
small
mottled
hands
it
was
soothing
to
feel
herself
in
heeny
grasp
and
though
she
knew
the
attention
would
cost
her
three
dollars
she
was
secure
in
the
sense
that
abner
would
mind
it
had
been
clear
to
spragg
ever
since
their
rather
precipitate
departure
from
apex
city
that
abner
was
resolved
not
to
mind
resolved
at
any
cost
to
see
through
the
new
york
adventure
it
seemed
likely
now
that
the
cost
would
be
considerable
they
had
lived
in
new
york
for
two
years
without
any
social
benefit
to
their
daughter
and
it
was
of
course
for
that
purpose
that
they
had
come
if
at
the
time
there
had
been
other
and
more
pressing
reasons
they
were
such
as
spragg
and
her
husband
never
touched
on
even
in
the
gilded
privacy
of
their
bedroom
at
the
stentorian
and
so
completely
had
silence
closed
in
on
the
subject
that
to
spragg
it
had
become
she
really
believed
that
as
abner
put
it
they
had
left
apex
because
undine
was
too
big
for
the
place
she
seemed
as
yet
poor
child
too
small
for
new
york
actually
imperceptible
to
its
heedless
multitudes
and
her
mother
trembled
for
the
day
when
her
invisibility
should
be
borne
in
on
her
spragg
did
not
mind
the
long
delay
for
herself
she
had
stores
of
lymphatic
patience
but
she
had
noticed
lately
that
undine
was
beginning
to
be
nervous
and
there
was
nothing
that
undine
parents
dreaded
so
much
as
her
being
nervous
spragg
maternal
apprehensions
unconsciously
escaped
in
her
next
words
i
do
hope
she
quiet
down
now
she
murmured
feeling
quieter
herself
as
her
hand
sank
into
heeny
roomy
palm
who
that
undine
yes
she
seemed
so
set
on
that
popple
coming
round
from
the
way
he
acted
last
night
she
thought
he
be
sure
to
come
round
this
morning
she
so
lonesome
poor
child
i
ca
say
as
i
blame
her
oh
he
come
round
things
do
happen
as
quick
as
that
in
new
york
said
heeny
driving
her
cheeringly
spragg
sighed
again
they
do
appear
to
they
say
new
yorkers
are
always
in
a
hurry
but
i
ca
say
as
they
hurried
much
to
make
our
acquaintance
heeny
drew
back
to
study
the
effect
of
her
work
you
wait
spragg
you
wait
if
you
go
too
fast
you
sometimes
have
to
rip
out
the
whole
seam
oh
that
so
that
so
spragg
exclaimed
with
a
tragic
emphasis
that
made
the
masseuse
glance
up
at
her
of
course
it
so
and
it
more
so
in
new
york
than
anywhere
the
wrong
set
like
once
you
in
it
you
can
pull
and
pull
but
you
never
get
out
of
it
again
undine
mother
heaved
another
and
more
helpless
sigh
i
wish
tell
undine
that
mrs
heeny
oh
i
guess
undine
all
right
a
girl
like
her
can
afford
to
wait
and
if
young
marvell
really
taken
with
her
she
have
the
run
of
the
place
in
no
time
this
solacing
thought
enabled
spragg
to
yield
herself
unreservedly
to
heeny
ministrations
which
were
prolonged
for
a
happy
confidential
hour
and
she
had
just
bidden
the
masseuse
and
was
restoring
the
rings
to
her
fingers
when
the
door
opened
to
admit
her
husband
spragg
came
in
silently
setting
his
high
hat
down
on
the
and
laying
his
overcoat
across
one
of
the
gilt
chairs
he
was
tallish
and
somewhat
stooping
with
the
slack
figure
of
the
sedentary
man
who
would
be
stout
if
he
were
not
dyspeptic
and
his
cautious
grey
eyes
with
underlids
had
straight
black
brows
like
his
daughter
his
thin
hair
was
worn
a
little
too
long
over
his
coat
collar
and
a
masonic
emblem
dangled
from
the
heavy
gold
chain
which
crossed
his
crumpled
black
waistcoat
he
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
room
casting
a
slow
pioneering
glance
about
its
gilded
void
then
he
said
gently
well
mother
spragg
remained
seated
but
her
eyes
dwelt
on
him
affectionately
undine
been
asked
out
to
a
and
heeny
says
it
to
one
of
the
first
families
it
the
sister
of
one
of
the
gentlemen
that
mabel
lipscomb
introduced
her
to
last
night
there
was
a
mild
triumph
in
her
tone
for
it
was
owing
to
her
insistence
and
undine
that
spragg
had
been
induced
to
give
up
the
house
they
had
bought
in
west
end
avenue
and
move
with
his
family
to
the
stentorian
undine
had
early
decided
that
they
could
not
hope
to
get
on
while
they
kept
house
all
the
fashionable
people
she
knew
either
boarded
or
lived
in
hotels
spragg
was
easily
induced
to
take
the
same
view
but
spragg
had
resisted
being
at
the
moment
unable
either
to
sell
his
house
or
to
let
it
as
advantageously
as
he
had
hoped
after
the
move
was
made
it
seemed
for
a
time
as
though
he
had
been
right
and
the
first
social
steps
would
be
as
difficult
to
make
in
a
hotel
as
in
one
own
house
and
spragg
was
therefore
eager
to
have
him
know
that
undine
really
owed
her
first
invitation
to
a
meeting
under
the
roof
of
the
stentorian
you
see
we
were
right
to
come
here
abner
she
added
and
he
absently
rejoined
i
guess
you
two
always
manage
to
be
right
but
his
face
remained
unsmiling
and
instead
of
seating
himself
and
lighting
his
cigar
as
he
usually
did
before
dinner
he
took
two
or
three
aimless
turns
about
the
room
and
then
paused
in
front
of
his
wife
what
the
matter
anything
wrong
down
town
she
asked
her
eyes
reflecting
his
anxiety
spragg
knowledge
of
what
went
on
down
town
was
of
the
most
elementary
kind
but
her
husband
face
was
the
barometer
in
which
she
had
long
been
accustomed
to
read
the
leave
to
go
on
unrestrictedly
or
the
warning
to
pause
and
abstain
till
the
coming
storm
should
be
weathered
he
shook
his
head
n
no
nothing
worse
than
what
i
can
see
to
if
you
and
undine
will
go
steady
for
a
while
he
paused
and
looked
across
the
room
at
his
daughter
door
where
is
she
out
i
guess
she
in
her
room
going
over
her
dresses
with
that
french
maid
i
do
know
as
she
got
anything
fit
to
wear
to
that
dinner
spragg
added
in
a
tentative
murmur
spragg
smiled
at
last
well
i
guess
she
will
have
he
said
prophetically
he
glanced
again
at
his
daughter
door
as
if
to
make
sure
of
its
being
shut
then
standing
close
before
his
wife
he
lowered
his
voice
to
say
i
saw
elmer
moffatt
down
town
oh
abner
a
wave
of
almost
physical
apprehension
passed
over
spragg
her
jewelled
hands
trembled
in
her
black
brocade
lap
and
the
pulpy
curves
of
her
face
collapsed
as
if
it
were
a
pricked
balloon
oh
abner
she
moaned
again
her
eyes
also
on
her
daughter
door
spragg
black
eyebrows
gathered
in
an
angry
frown
but
it
was
evident
that
his
anger
was
not
against
his
wife
what
the
good
of
oh
elmer
moffatt
nothing
to
us
no
if
we
never
laid
eyes
on
him
no
i
know
it
but
what
he
doing
here
did
you
speak
to
him
she
faltered
he
slipped
his
thumbs
into
his
waistcoat
pockets
no
i
guess
elmer
and
i
are
pretty
well
talked
out
spragg
took
up
her
moan
do
you
tell
her
you
saw
him
abner
i
do
as
you
say
but
she
may
meet
him
herself
oh
i
guess
not
not
in
this
new
set
she
going
with
do
tell
her
anyhow
he
turned
away
feeling
for
one
of
the
cigars
which
he
always
carried
loose
in
his
pocket
and
his
wife
rising
stole
after
him
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
he
ca
do
anything
to
her
can
he
do
anything
to
her
he
swung
about
furiously
i
like
to
see
him
touch
her
that
all
ii
undine
white
and
gold
bedroom
with
panels
and
old
rose
carpet
looked
along
street
toward
the
leafless
of
the
central
park
she
went
to
the
window
and
drawing
back
its
many
layers
of
lace
gazed
eastward
down
the
long
brownstone
perspective
beyond
the
park
lay
fifth
avenue
and
fifth
avenue
was
where
she
wanted
to
be
she
turned
back
into
the
room
and
going
to
her
laid
fairford
note
before
her
and
began
to
study
it
minutely
she
had
read
in
the
boudoir
chat
of
one
of
the
sunday
papers
that
the
smartest
women
were
using
the
new
notepaper
with
white
ink
and
rather
against
her
mother
advice
she
had
ordered
a
large
supply
with
her
monogram
in
silver
it
was
a
disappointment
therefore
to
find
that
fairford
wrote
on
the
white
sheet
without
even
a
monogram
simply
her
address
and
telephone
number
it
gave
undine
rather
a
poor
opinion
of
fairford
social
standing
and
for
a
moment
she
thought
with
considerable
satisfaction
of
answering
the
note
on
her
paper
then
she
remembered
heeny
emphatic
commendation
of
fairford
and
her
pen
wavered
what
if
white
paper
were
really
newer
than
pigeon
blood
it
might
be
more
stylish
anyhow
well
she
did
care
if
fairford
did
like
red
paper
she
did
and
she
was
going
to
truckle
to
any
woman
who
lived
in
a
small
house
down
beyond
park
avenue
undine
was
fiercely
independent
and
yet
passionately
imitative
she
wanted
to
surprise
every
one
by
her
dash
and
originality
but
she
could
not
help
modelling
herself
on
the
last
person
she
met
and
the
confusion
of
ideals
thus
produced
caused
her
much
perturbation
when
she
had
to
choose
between
two
courses
she
hesitated
a
moment
longer
and
then
took
from
the
drawer
a
plain
sheet
with
the
hotel
address
it
was
amusing
to
write
the
note
in
her
mother
name
she
giggled
as
she
formed
the
phrase
i
shall
be
happy
to
permit
my
daughter
to
take
dinner
with
you
take
dinner
seemed
more
elegant
than
dine
but
when
she
came
to
the
signature
she
was
met
by
a
new
difficulty
fairford
had
signed
herself
laura
fairford
just
as
one
would
write
to
another
but
could
this
be
a
proper
model
for
spragg
undine
could
not
tolerate
the
thought
of
her
abasing
herself
to
a
denizen
of
regions
beyond
park
avenue
and
she
resolutely
formed
the
signature
sincerely
abner
e
spragg
then
uncertainty
overcame
her
and
she
her
note
and
copied
fairford
formula
yours
sincerely
leota
b
spragg
but
this
struck
her
as
an
odd
juxtaposition
of
formality
and
freedom
and
she
made
a
third
attempt
yours
with
love
leota
b
spragg
this
however
seemed
excessive
as
the
ladies
had
never
met
and
after
several
other
experiments
she
finally
decided
on
a
compromise
and
ended
the
note
yours
sincerely
leota
b
spragg
that
might
be
conventional
undine
reflected
but
it
was
certainly
correct
this
point
settled
she
flung
open
her
door
calling
imperiously
down
the
passage
celeste
and
adding
as
the
french
maid
appeared
i
want
to
look
over
all
my
considering
the
extent
of
miss
spragg
wardrobe
her
were
not
many
she
had
ordered
a
number
the
year
before
but
vexed
at
her
lack
of
use
for
them
had
tossed
them
over
impatiently
to
the
maid
since
then
indeed
she
and
spragg
had
succumbed
to
the
abstract
pleasure
of
buying
two
or
three
more
simply
because
they
were
too
exquisite
and
undine
looked
too
lovely
in
them
but
she
had
grown
tired
of
these
also
tired
of
seeing
them
hang
unworn
in
her
wardrobe
like
so
many
derisive
points
of
interrogation
and
now
as
celeste
spread
them
out
on
the
bed
they
seemed
disgustingly
and
as
familiar
as
if
she
had
danced
them
to
shreds
nevertheless
she
yielded
to
the
maid
persuasions
and
tried
them
on
the
first
and
second
did
not
gain
by
prolonged
inspection
they
looked
already
it
something
about
the
sleeves
undine
grumbled
as
she
threw
them
aside
the
third
was
certainly
the
prettiest
but
then
it
was
the
one
she
had
worn
at
the
hotel
dance
the
night
before
and
the
impossibility
of
wearing
it
again
within
the
week
was
too
obvious
for
discussion
yet
she
enjoyed
looking
at
herself
in
it
for
it
reminded
her
of
her
sparkling
passages
with
claud
walsingham
popple
and
her
quieter
but
more
fruitful
talk
with
his
little
friend
the
young
man
she
had
hardly
noticed
you
can
go
celeste
i
take
off
the
dress
myself
she
said
and
when
celeste
had
passed
out
laden
with
discarded
finery
undine
bolted
her
door
dragged
the
tall
forward
and
rummaging
in
a
drawer
for
fan
and
gloves
swept
to
a
seat
before
the
mirror
with
the
air
of
a
lady
arriving
at
an
evening
party
celeste
before
leaving
had
drawn
down
the
blinds
and
turned
on
the
electric
light
and
the
white
and
gold
room
with
its
blazing
formed
a
sufficiently
brilliant
background
to
carry
out
the
illusion
so
untempered
a
glare
would
have
been
destructive
to
all
and
subtleties
of
modelling
but
undine
beauty
was
as
vivid
and
almost
as
crude
as
the
brightness
suffusing
it
her
black
brows
her
hair
and
the
pure
red
and
white
of
her
complexion
defied
the
searching
decomposing
radiance
she
might
have
been
some
fabled
creature
whose
home
was
in
a
beam
of
light
undine
as
a
child
had
taken
but
a
lukewarm
interest
in
the
diversions
of
her
playmates
even
in
the
early
days
when
she
had
lived
with
her
parents
in
a
ragged
outskirt
of
apex
and
hung
on
the
fence
with
indiana
frusk
the
freckled
daughter
of
the
plumber
across
the
way
she
had
cared
little
for
dolls
or
and
still
less
for
the
riotous
games
in
which
the
loud
indiana
played
atalanta
to
all
the
boyhood
of
the
quarter
already
undine
chief
delight
was
to
dress
up
in
her
mother
sunday
skirt
and
play
lady
before
the
wardrobe
mirror
the
taste
had
outlasted
childhood
and
she
still
practised
the
same
secret
pantomime
gliding
in
settling
her
skirts
swaying
her
fan
moving
her
lips
in
soundless
talk
and
laughter
but
lately
she
had
shrunk
from
everything
that
reminded
her
of
her
baffled
social
yearnings
now
however
she
could
yield
without
afterthought
to
the
joy
of
dramatizing
her
beauty
within
a
few
days
she
would
be
enacting
the
scene
she
was
now
mimicking
and
it
amused
her
to
see
in
advance
just
what
impression
she
would
produce
on
fairford
guests
for
a
while
she
carried
on
her
chat
with
an
imaginary
circle
of
admirers
twisting
this
way
and
that
fanning
fidgeting
twitching
at
her
draperies
as
she
did
in
real
life
when
people
were
noticing
her
her
incessant
movements
were
not
the
result
of
shyness
she
thought
it
the
correct
thing
to
be
animated
in
society
and
noise
and
restlessness
were
her
only
notion
of
vivacity
she
therefore
watched
herself
approvingly
admiring
the
light
on
her
hair
the
flash
of
teeth
between
her
smiling
lips
the
pure
shadows
of
her
throat
and
shoulders
as
she
passed
from
one
attitude
to
another
only
one
fact
disturbed
her
there
was
a
hint
of
too
much
fulness
in
the
curves
of
her
neck
and
in
the
spring
of
her
hips
she
was
tall
enough
to
carry
off
a
little
extra
weight
but
excessive
slimness
was
the
fashion
and
she
shuddered
at
the
thought
that
she
might
some
day
deviate
from
the
perpendicular
presently
she
ceased
to
twist
and
sparkle
at
her
image
and
sinking
into
her
chair
gave
herself
up
to
retrospection
she
was
vexed
in
looking
back
to
think
how
little
notice
she
had
taken
of
young
marvell
who
turned
out
to
be
so
much
less
negligible
than
his
brilliant
friend
she
remembered
thinking
him
rather
shy
less
accustomed
to
society
and
though
in
his
quiet
deprecating
way
he
had
said
one
or
two
droll
things
he
lacked
popple
masterly
manner
his
domineering
yet
caressing
address
when
popple
had
fixed
his
black
eyes
on
undine
and
murmured
something
artistic
about
the
colour
of
her
hair
she
had
thrilled
to
the
depths
of
her
being
even
now
it
seemed
incredible
that
he
should
not
turn
out
to
be
more
distinguished
than
young
marvell
he
seemed
so
much
more
in
the
key
of
the
world
she
read
about
in
the
sunday
papers
the
dazzling
auriferous
world
of
the
van
degens
the
driscolls
and
their
peers
she
was
roused
by
the
sound
in
the
hall
of
her
mother
last
words
to
heeny
undine
waited
till
their
adieux
were
over
then
opening
her
door
she
seized
the
astonished
masseuse
and
dragged
her
into
the
room
heeny
gazed
in
admiration
at
the
luminous
apparition
in
whose
hold
she
found
herself
mercy
undine
you
do
look
stunning
are
you
trying
on
your
dress
for
mrs
fairford
yes
no
this
is
only
an
old
thing
the
girl
eyes
glittered
under
their
black
brows
heeny
you
got
to
tell
me
the
truth
are
they
as
swell
as
you
said
who
the
fairfords
and
marvells
if
they
ai
swell
enough
for
you
undine
spragg
you
better
go
right
over
to
the
court
of
england
undine
straightened
herself
i
want
the
best
are
they
as
swell
as
the
driscolls
and
van
degens
heeny
sounded
a
scornful
laugh
look
at
here
now
you
unbelieving
girl
as
sure
as
i
standing
here
before
you
i
seen
harmon
driscoll
of
fifth
avenue
laying
in
her
pink
velvet
bed
with
honiton
lace
sheets
on
it
and
crying
her
eyes
out
because
she
could
get
asked
to
one
of
paul
marvell
musicals
she
never
dreamt
of
being
asked
to
a
dinner
there
not
all
of
her
money
could
bought
her
that
and
she
knows
it
undine
stood
for
a
moment
with
bright
cheeks
and
parted
lips
then
she
flung
her
soft
arms
about
the
masseuse
oh
heeny
you
lovely
to
me
she
breathed
her
lips
on
heeny
rusty
veil
while
the
latter
freeing
herself
with
a
laugh
said
as
she
turned
away
go
steady
undine
and
you
get
anywheres
go
steady
undine
yes
that
was
the
advice
she
needed
sometimes
in
her
dark
moods
she
blamed
her
parents
for
not
having
given
it
to
her
she
was
so
young
and
they
had
told
her
so
little
as
she
looked
back
she
shuddered
at
some
of
her
escapes
even
since
they
had
come
to
new
york
she
had
been
on
the
verge
of
one
or
two
perilous
adventures
and
there
had
been
a
moment
during
their
first
winter
when
she
had
actually
engaged
herself
to
the
handsome
austrian
who
accompanied
her
in
the
park
he
had
carelessly
shown
her
a
with
a
coronet
and
had
confided
in
her
that
he
had
been
forced
to
resign
from
a
crack
cavalry
regiment
for
fighting
a
duel
about
a
countess
and
as
a
result
of
these
confidences
she
had
pledged
herself
to
him
and
bestowed
on
him
her
pink
pearl
ring
in
exchange
for
one
of
twisted
silver
which
he
said
the
countess
had
given
him
on
her
deathbed
with
the
request
that
he
should
never
take
it
off
till
he
met
a
woman
more
beautiful
than
herself
soon
afterward
luckily
undine
had
run
across
mabel
lipscomb
whom
she
had
known
at
a
middle
western
as
mabel
blitch
miss
blitch
occupied
a
position
of
distinction
as
the
only
new
york
girl
at
the
school
and
for
a
time
there
had
been
sharp
rivalry
for
her
favour
between
undine
and
indiana
frusk
whose
parents
had
somehow
contrived
for
one
term
to
obtain
her
admission
to
the
same
establishment
in
spite
of
indiana
unscrupulous
methods
and
of
a
certain
violent
way
she
had
of
capturing
attention
the
victory
remained
with
undine
whom
mabel
pronounced
more
refined
and
the
discomfited
indiana
denouncing
her
schoolmates
as
a
bunch
of
mushes
had
disappeared
forever
from
the
scene
of
her
defeat
since
then
mabel
had
returned
to
new
york
and
married
a
and
undine
first
steps
in
social
enlightenment
dated
from
the
day
when
she
had
met
harry
lipscomb
and
been
again
taken
under
her
wing
harry
lipscomb
had
insisted
on
investigating
the
record
and
had
found
that
his
real
name
was
aaronson
and
that
he
had
left
cracow
under
a
charge
of
swindling
out
of
their
savings
in
the
light
of
which
discoveries
undine
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
his
lips
were
too
red
and
that
his
hair
was
pommaded
that
was
one
of
the
episodes
that
sickened
her
as
she
looked
back
and
made
her
resolve
once
more
to
trust
less
to
her
impulses
especially
in
the
matter
of
giving
away
rings
in
the
interval
however
she
felt
she
had
learned
a
good
deal
especially
since
by
mabel
lipscomb
advice
the
spraggs
had
moved
to
the
stentorian
where
that
lady
was
herself
established
there
was
nothing
of
the
monopolist
about
mabel
and
she
lost
no
time
in
making
undine
free
of
the
stentorian
group
and
its
affiliated
branches
a
society
addicted
to
days
and
linked
together
by
membership
in
countless
clubs
mundane
cultural
or
earnest
mabel
took
undine
to
the
days
and
introduced
her
as
a
guest
to
the
where
she
was
supported
by
the
presence
of
many
other
guests
my
friend
miss
stager
of

or
if
the

were

friend

what
chettle

of
these
reunions
took
place
in
the
lofty
hotels
moored
like
a
sonorously
named
fleet
of
along
the
upper
reaches
of
the
west
side
the
olympian
the
incandescent
the
ormolu
while
others
perhaps
the
more
exclusive
were
held
in
the
equally
lofty
but
more
romantically
styled
the
parthenon
the
tintern
abbey
or
the
lido
undine
preference
was
for
the
worldly
parties
at
which
games
were
played
and
she
returned
home
laden
with
prizes
in
dutch
silver
but
she
was
duly
impressed
by
the
debating
clubs
where
ladies
of
local
distinction
addressed
the
company
from
an
improvised
platform
or
the
members
argued
on
subjects
of
such
imperishable
interest
as
what
is
charm
or
the
after
which
pink
lemonade
and
rainbow
sandwiches
were
consumed
amid
heated
discussion
of
the
ethical
aspect
of
the
question
it
was
all
very
novel
and
interesting
and
at
first
undine
envied
mabel
lipscomb
for
having
made
herself
a
place
in
such
circles
but
in
time
she
began
to
despise
her
for
being
content
to
remain
there
for
it
did
not
take
undine
long
to
learn
that
introduction
to
mabel
set
had
brought
her
no
nearer
to
fifth
avenue
even
in
apex
undine
tender
imagination
had
been
nurtured
on
the
feats
and
gestures
of
fifth
avenue
she
knew
all
of
new
york
golden
aristocracy
by
name
and
the
lineaments
of
its
most
distinguished
scions
had
been
made
familiar
by
passionate
poring
over
the
daily
press
in
mabel
world
she
sought
in
vain
for
the
originals
and
only
now
and
then
caught
a
tantalizing
glimpse
of
one
of
their
familiars
as
when
claud
walsingham
popple
engaged
on
the
portrait
of
a
lady
whom
the
lipscombs
described
as
the
wife
of
a
steel
magnet
felt
it
his
duty
to
attend
one
of
his
teas
where
it
became
mabel
privilege
to
make
his
acquaintance
and
to
name
to
him
her
friend
miss
spragg
unsuspected
social
gradations
were
thus
revealed
to
the
attentive
undine
but
she
was
beginning
to
think
that
her
sad
proficiency
had
been
acquired
in
vain
when
her
hopes
were
revived
by
the
appearance
of
popple
and
his
friend
at
the
stentorian
dance
she
thought
she
had
learned
enough
to
be
safe
from
any
risk
of
repeating
the
hideous
aaronson
mistake
yet
she
now
saw
she
had
blundered
again
in
distinguishing
claud
walsingham
popple
while
she
almost
snubbed
his
more
retiring
companion
it
was
all
very
puzzling
and
her
perplexity
had
been
farther
increased
by
heeny
tale
of
the
great
harmon
driscoll
despair
hitherto
undine
had
imagined
that
the
driscoll
and
van
degen
clans
and
their
allies
held
undisputed
suzerainty
over
new
york
society
mabel
lipscomb
thought
so
too
and
was
given
to
bragging
of
her
acquaintance
with
a
spoff
who
was
merely
a
second
cousin
of
harmon
driscoll
yet
here
was
she
undine
spragg
of
apex
about
to
be
introduced
into
an
inner
circle
to
which
driscolls
and
van
degens
had
laid
siege
in
vain
it
was
enough
to
make
her
feel
a
little
dizzy
with
her
triumph
to
work
her
up
into
that
state
of
perilous
in
which
all
her
worst
follies
had
been
committed
she
stood
up
and
going
close
to
the
glass
examined
the
reflection
of
her
bright
eyes
and
glowing
cheeks
this
time
her
fears
were
superfluous
there
were
to
be
no
more
mistakes
and
no
more
follies
now
she
was
going
to
know
the
right
people
at
last
she
was
going
to
get
what
she
wanted
as
she
stood
there
smiling
at
her
happy
image
she
heard
her
voice
in
the
room
beyond
and
instantly
began
to
tear
off
her
dress
strip
the
long
gloves
from
her
arms
and
unpin
the
rose
in
her
hair
tossing
the
fallen
finery
aside
she
slipped
on
a
and
opened
the
door
into
the
spragg
was
standing
near
her
mother
who
sat
in
a
drooping
attitude
her
head
sunk
on
her
breast
as
she
did
when
she
had
one
of
her
turns
he
looked
up
abruptly
as
undine
entered
father
has
mother
told
you
fairford
has
asked
me
to
dine
paul
marvell
daughter
marvell
was
a
dagonet
and
sweller
than
anybody
they
wo
know
the
driscolls
and
van
degens
spragg
surveyed
her
with
humorous
fondness
that
so
what
do
they
want
to
know
you
for
i
wonder
he
jeered
ca
imagine
unless
they
think
i
introduce
you
she
jeered
back
in
the
same
key
her
arms
around
his
stooping
shoulders
her
shining
hair
against
his
cheek
well
and
are
you
going
to
have
you
accepted
he
took
up
her
joke
as
she
held
him
pinioned
while
spragg
behind
them
stirred
in
her
seat
with
a
little
moan
undine
threw
back
her
head
plunging
her
eyes
in
his
and
pressing
so
close
that
to
his
tired
elderly
sight
her
face
was
a
mere
bright
blur
i
want
to
awfully
she
declared
but
i
have
got
a
single
thing
to
wear
spragg
at
this
moaned
more
audibly
undine
i
would
ask
father
to
buy
any
more
clothes
right
on
top
of
those
last
bills
i
ai
on
top
of
those
last
bills
yet
i
way
down
under
them
spragg
interrupted
raising
his
hands
to
imprison
his
daughter
slender
wrists
oh
well
if
you
want
me
to
look
like
a
scarecrow
and
not
get
asked
again
i
got
a
dress
that
do
perfectly
undine
threatened
in
a
tone
between
banter
and
vexation
spragg
held
her
away
at
arm
length
a
smile
drawing
up
the
loose
wrinkles
about
his
eyes
well
that
kind
of
dress
might
come
in
mighty
handy
on
some
occasions
so
i
guess
you
better
hold
on
to
it
for
future
use
and
go
and
select
another
for
this
fairford
dinner
he
said
and
before
he
could
finish
he
was
in
her
arms
again
and
she
was
smothering
his
last
word
in
little
cries
and
kisses
iii
though
she
would
not
for
the
world
have
owned
it
to
her
parents
undine
was
disappointed
in
the
fairford
dinner
the
house
to
begin
with
was
small
and
rather
shabby
there
was
no
gilding
no
lavish
diffusion
of
light
the
room
they
sat
in
after
dinner
with
its
lamps
making
faint
pools
of
brightness
and
its
rows
of
books
from
floor
to
ceiling
reminded
undine
of
the
old
circulating
library
at
apex
before
the
new
marble
building
was
put
up
then
instead
of
a
or
a
polished
grate
with
electric
bulbs
behind
ruby
glass
there
was
an
like
pictures
of
back
to
the
farm
for
christmas
and
when
the
logs
fell
forward
pairford
or
her
brother
had
to
jump
up
to
push
them
in
place
and
the
ashes
scattered
over
the
hearth
untidily
the
dinner
too
was
disappointing
undine
was
too
young
to
take
note
of
culinary
details
but
she
had
expected
to
view
the
company
through
a
bower
of
orchids
and
eat
entrees
in
ruffled
papers
instead
there
was
only
a
low
of
ferns
and
plain
roasted
and
broiled
meat
that
one
could
recognize
as
if
they
been
dyspeptics
on
a
diet
with
all
the
hints
in
the
sunday
papers
she
thought
it
dull
of
fairford
not
to
have
picked
up
something
newer
and
as
the
evening
progressed
she
began
to
suspect
that
it
was
a
real
dinner
party
and
that
they
had
just
asked
her
in
to
share
what
they
had
when
they
were
alone
but
a
glance
about
the
table
convinced
her
that
fairford
could
not
have
meant
to
treat
her
other
guests
so
lightly
they
were
only
eight
in
number
but
one
was
no
less
a
person
than
young
peter
van
degen
the
one
who
had
been
a
dagonet
and
the
consideration
which
this
young
lady
herself
one
of
the
choicest
ornaments
of
the
society
column
displayed
toward
the
rest
of
the
company
convinced
undine
that
they
must
be
more
important
than
they
looked
she
liked
fairford
a
small
incisive
woman
with
a
big
nose
and
good
teeth
revealed
by
frequent
smiles
in
her
dowdy
black
and
antiquated
ornaments
she
was
not
what
undine
would
have
called
stylish
but
she
had
a
droll
kind
way
which
reminded
the
girl
of
her
father
manner
when
he
was
not
tired
or
worried
about
money
one
of
the
other
ladies
having
white
hair
did
not
long
arrest
undine
attention
and
the
fourth
a
girl
like
herself
who
was
introduced
as
miss
harriet
ray
she
dismissed
at
a
glance
as
plain
and
wearing
a
last
year
model
the
men
too
were
less
striking
than
she
had
hoped
she
had
not
expected
much
of
fairford
since
married
men
were
intrinsically
uninteresting
and
his
baldness
and
grey
moustache
seemed
naturally
to
relegate
him
to
the
background
but
she
had
looked
for
some
brilliant
youths
of
her
own
age
in
her
inmost
heart
she
had
looked
for
popple
he
was
not
there
however
and
of
the
other
men
one
whom
they
called
bowen
was
hopelessly
elderly
she
supposed
he
was
the
husband
of
the
lady
and
the
other
two
who
seemed
to
be
friends
of
young
marvell
were
both
lacking
in
claud
dash
undine
sat
between
bowen
and
young
marvell
who
struck
her
as
very
sweet
it
was
her
word
for
friendliness
but
even
shyer
than
at
the
hotel
dance
yet
she
was
not
sure
if
he
were
shy
or
if
his
quietness
were
only
a
new
kind
of
which
expressed
itself
negatively
instead
of
aggressively
small
fair
he
sat
stroking
his
slight
blond
moustache
and
looking
at
her
with
kindly
almost
tender
eyes
but
he
left
it
to
his
sister
and
the
others
to
draw
her
out
and
fit
her
into
the
pattern
fairford
talked
so
well
that
the
girl
wondered
why
heeny
had
found
her
lacking
in
conversation
but
though
undine
thought
silent
people
awkward
she
was
not
easily
impressed
by
verbal
fluency
all
the
ladies
in
apex
city
were
more
voluble
than
fairford
and
had
a
larger
vocabulary
the
difference
was
that
with
fairford
conversation
seemed
to
be
a
concert
and
not
a
solo
she
kept
drawing
in
the
others
giving
each
a
turn
beating
time
for
them
with
her
smile
and
somehow
harmonizing
and
linking
together
what
they
said
she
took
particular
pains
to
give
undine
her
due
part
in
the
performance
but
the
girl
expansive
impulses
were
always
balanced
by
odd
reactions
of
mistrust
and
the
latter
prevailed
she
meant
to
watch
and
listen
without
letting
herself
go
and
she
sat
very
straight
and
pink
answering
promptly
but
briefly
with
the
nervous
laugh
that
punctuated
all
her
phrases
saying
i
do
care
if
i
do
when
her
host
asked
her
to
try
some
grapes
and
i
would
wonder
when
she
thought
any
one
was
trying
to
astonish
her
this
state
of
lucidity
enabled
her
to
take
note
of
all
that
was
being
said
the
talk
ran
more
on
general
questions
and
less
on
people
than
she
was
used
to
but
though
the
allusions
to
pictures
and
books
escaped
her
she
caught
and
stored
up
every
personal
reference
and
the
pink
in
her
cheeks
deepened
at
a
random
mention
of
popple
yes
he
doing
me
peter
van
degen
was
saying
in
her
slightly
drawling
voice
he
doing
everybody
this
year
you
know
as
if
that
were
a
reason
undine
heard
fairford
breathe
to
bowen
who
replied
at
the
same
pitch
it
a
van
degen
reason
it
to
which
fairford
shrugged
assentingly
that
delightful
popple
he
paints
so
exactly
as
he
talks
the
lady
took
it
up
all
his
portraits
seem
to
proclaim
what
a
gentleman
he
is
and
how
he
fascinates
women
they
not
pictures
of
or
miss
but
simply
of
the
impression
popple
thinks
made
on
them
fairford
smiled
i
sometimes
thought
she
mused
that
popple
must
be
the
only
gentleman
i
know
at
least
he
the
only
man
who
has
ever
told
me
he
was
a
gentleman
and
popple
never
fails
to
mention
it
undine
ear
was
too
well
attuned
to
the
national
note
of
irony
for
her
not
to
perceive
that
her
companions
were
making
sport
of
the
painter
she
winced
at
their
banter
as
if
it
had
been
at
her
own
expense
yet
it
gave
her
a
dizzy
sense
of
being
at
last
in
the
very
stronghold
of
fashion
her
attention
was
diverted
by
hearing
van
degen
under
cover
of
the
general
laugh
say
in
a
low
tone
to
young
marvell
i
thought
you
liked
his
things
or
i
would
have
had
him
paint
me
something
in
her
tone
made
all
undine
perceptions
bristle
and
she
strained
her
ears
for
the
answer
i
think
he
do
you
capitally
you
must
let
me
come
and
see
some
day
soon
marvell
tone
was
always
so
light
so
unemphasized
that
she
could
not
be
sure
of
its
being
as
indifferent
as
it
sounded
she
looked
down
at
the
fruit
on
her
plate
and
shot
a
through
her
lashes
at
peter
van
degen
van
degen
was
neither
beautiful
nor
imposing
just
a
dark
creature
with
plaintive
eyes
and
a
fidgety
frequent
laugh
but
she
was
more
elaborately
dressed
and
jewelled
than
the
other
ladies
and
her
elegance
and
her
restlessness
made
her
seem
less
alien
to
undine
she
had
turned
on
marvell
a
gaze
at
once
pleading
and
possessive
but
whether
betokening
merely
an
inherited
intimacy
undine
had
noticed
that
they
were
all
more
or
less
cousins
or
a
more
personal
feeling
her
observer
was
unable
to
decide
just
as
the
tone
of
the
young
man
reply
might
have
expressed
the
open
avowal
of
or
the
disguise
of
a
different
sentiment
all
was
blurred
and
puzzling
to
the
girl
in
this
world
of
eliminations
and
abbreviations
and
she
felt
a
violent
longing
to
brush
away
the
cobwebs
and
assert
herself
as
the
dominant
figure
of
the
scene
yet
in
the
with
the
ladies
where
fairford
came
and
sat
by
her
the
spirit
of
caution
once
more
prevailed
she
wanted
to
be
noticed
but
she
dreaded
to
be
patronized
and
here
again
her
gradations
of
tone
were
confusing
fairford
made
no
tactless
allusions
to
her
being
a
newcomer
in
new
york
there
was
nothing
as
bitter
to
the
girl
as
that
but
her
questions
as
to
what
pictures
had
interested
undine
at
the
various
exhibitions
of
the
moment
and
which
of
the
new
books
she
had
read
were
almost
as
open
to
suspicion
since
they
had
to
be
answered
in
the
negative
undine
did
not
even
know
that
there
were
any
pictures
to
be
seen
much
less
that
people
went
to
see
them
and
she
had
read
no
new
book
but
when
the
kissing
had
to
stop
of
which
fairford
seemed
not
to
have
heard
on
the
theatre
they
were
equally
at
odds
for
while
undine
had
seen
oolaloo
fourteen
times
and
was
wild
about
ned
norris
in
the
fountain
she
had
not
heard
of
the
famous
berlin
comedians
who
were
performing
shakespeare
at
the
german
theatre
and
knew
only
by
name
the
clever
american
actress
who
was
trying
to
give
repertory
plays
with
a
good
stock
company
the
conversation
was
revived
for
a
moment
by
her
recalling
that
she
had
seen
sarah
bernhard
in
a
play
she
called
and
another
which
she
pronounced
fade
but
even
this
did
not
carry
them
far
as
she
had
forgotten
what
both
plays
were
about
and
had
found
the
actress
a
good
deal
older
than
she
expected
matters
were
not
improved
by
the
return
of
the
men
from
the
henley
fairford
replaced
his
wife
at
undine
side
and
since
it
was
at
apex
for
a
married
man
to
force
his
society
on
a
young
girl
she
inferred
that
the
others
did
care
to
talk
to
her
and
that
her
host
and
hostess
were
in
league
to
take
her
off
their
hands
this
discovery
resulted
in
her
holding
her
vivid
head
very
high
and
answering
i
could
really
say
or
is
that
so
to
all
fairford
ventures
and
as
these
were
neither
numerous
nor
striking
it
was
a
relief
to
both
when
the
rising
of
the
elderly
lady
gave
the
signal
for
departure
in
the
hall
where
young
marvell
had
managed
to
precede
her
undine
found
van
degen
putting
on
her
cloak
as
she
gathered
it
about
her
she
laid
her
hand
on
marvell
arm
ralphie
dear
you
come
to
the
opera
with
me
on
friday
we
dine
together
first
peter
got
a
club
dinner
they
exchanged
what
seemed
a
smile
of
intelligence
and
undine
heard
the
young
man
accept
then
van
degen
turned
to
her
miss
spragg
i
hope
you
come
to
dine
with
me
too
that
must
be
what
she
was
going
to
say
and
undine
heart
gave
a
to
see
me
some
afternoon
van
degen
ended
going
down
the
steps
to
her
motor
at
the
door
of
which
a
footman
waited
with
more
furs
on
his
arm
undine
face
burned
as
she
turned
to
receive
her
cloak
when
she
had
drawn
it
on
with
haughty
deliberation
she
found
marvell
at
her
side
in
hat
and
overcoat
and
her
heart
gave
a
higher
bound
he
was
going
to
escort
her
home
of
course
this
brilliant
youth
she
felt
now
that
he
was
brilliant
who
dined
alone
with
married
women
whom
the
van
degen
set
called
ralphie
dear
had
really
no
eyes
for
any
one
but
herself
and
at
the
thought
her
lost
flowed
back
warm
through
her
veins
the
street
was
coated
with
ice
and
she
had
a
delicious
moment
descending
the
steps
on
marvell
arm
and
holding
it
fast
while
they
waited
for
her
cab
to
come
up
but
when
he
had
helped
her
in
he
closed
the
door
and
held
his
hand
out
over
the
lowered
window
he
said
smiling
and
she
could
not
help
the
break
of
pride
in
her
voice
as
she
faltered
out
stupidly
from
the
depths
of
her
disillusionment
oh
iv
father
you
got
to
take
a
box
for
me
at
the
opera
next
friday
from
the
tone
of
her
voice
undine
parents
knew
at
once
that
she
was
nervous
they
had
counted
a
great
deal
on
the
fairford
dinner
as
a
means
of
tranquillization
and
it
was
a
blow
to
detect
signs
of
the
opposite
result
when
late
the
next
morning
their
daughter
came
dawdling
into
the
sodden
splendour
of
the
stentorian
the
symptoms
of
undine
nervousness
were
unmistakable
to
and
spragg
they
could
read
the
approaching
storm
in
the
darkening
of
her
eyes
from
limpid
grey
to
and
in
the
way
her
straight
black
brows
met
above
them
and
the
red
curves
of
her
lips
narrowed
to
a
parallel
line
below
spragg
having
finished
the
last
course
of
his
heterogeneous
meal
was
adjusting
his
gold
for
a
glance
at
the
paper
when
undine
trailed
down
the
sumptuous
stuffy
room
where
hung
perpetually
under
the
emblazoned
ceiling
and
the
spongy
carpet
might
have
absorbed
a
year
crumbs
without
a
sweeping
about
them
sat
other
pallid
families
richly
dressed
and
silently
eating
their
way
through
a
which
seemed
to
have
ransacked
the
globe
for
gastronomic
incompatibilities
and
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
knot
of
equally
pallid
waiters
engaged
in
languid
conversation
turned
their
backs
by
common
consent
on
the
persons
they
were
supposed
to
serve
undine
who
rose
too
late
to
share
the
family
breakfast
usually
had
her
chocolate
brought
to
her
in
bed
by
celeste
after
the
manner
described
in
the
articles
on
a
society
woman
day
which
were
appearing
in
boudoir
chat
her
mere
appearance
in
the
restaurant
therefore
prepared
her
parents
for
those
symptoms
of
excessive
tension
which
a
nearer
inspection
confirmed
and
spragg
folded
his
paper
and
hooked
his
glasses
to
his
waistcoat
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
prefers
to
know
the
worst
and
have
it
over
an
opera
box
faltered
spragg
pushing
aside
the
bananas
and
cream
with
which
she
had
been
trying
to
tempt
an
appetite
too
languid
for
fried
liver
or
crab
mayonnaise
a
parterre
box
undine
corrected
ignoring
the
exclamation
and
continuing
to
address
herself
to
her
father
friday
the
stylish
night
and
that
new
tenor
going
to
sing
again
in
she
condescended
to
explain
that
so
spragg
thrust
his
hands
into
his
waistcoat
pockets
and
began
to
tilt
his
chair
till
he
remembered
there
was
no
wall
to
meet
it
he
regained
his
balance
and
said
would
a
couple
of
good
orchestra
seats
do
you
no
they
would
undine
answered
with
a
darkening
brow
he
looked
at
her
humorously
you
invited
the
whole
i
suppose
no
no
one
going
all
alone
in
a
box
she
was
disdainfully
silent
i
do
you
thinking
of
taking
mother
and
me
this
was
so
obviously
comic
that
they
all
laughed
even
spragg
and
undine
went
on
more
mildly
i
want
to
do
something
for
mabel
lipscomb
make
some
return
she
always
taking
me
and
i
never
done
a
thing
for
her
not
a
single
thing
this
appeal
to
the
national
belief
in
the
duty
of
reciprocal
treating
could
not
fail
of
its
effect
and
spragg
murmured
she
never
has
abner
but
spragg
brow
remained
unrelenting
do
you
know
what
a
box
costs
no
but
i
you
do
undine
returned
with
unconscious
flippancy
i
do
that
the
trouble
why
wo
seats
do
you
mabel
could
buy
seats
for
herself
that
so
interpolated
spragg
always
the
first
to
succumb
to
her
daughter
arguments
well
i
guess
i
ca
buy
a
box
for
her
undine
face
gloomed
more
deeply
she
sat
silent
her
chocolate
thickening
in
the
cup
while
one
hand
almost
as
much
beringed
as
her
mother
drummed
on
the
crumpled
we
might
as
well
go
straight
back
to
apex
she
breathed
at
last
between
her
teeth
spragg
cast
a
frightened
glance
at
her
husband
these
struggles
between
two
resolute
wills
always
brought
on
her
palpitations
and
she
wished
she
had
her
phial
of
digitalis
with
her
a
parterre
box
costs
a
hundred
and
dollars
a
night
said
spragg
transferring
a
toothpick
to
his
waistcoat
pocket
i
only
want
it
once
he
looked
at
her
with
a
quizzical
puckering
of
his
you
only
want
most
things
once
undine
it
was
an
observation
they
had
made
in
her
earliest
youth
undine
never
wanted
anything
long
but
she
wanted
it
right
off
and
until
she
got
it
the
house
was
uninhabitable
i
a
good
deal
rather
have
a
box
for
the
season
she
rejoined
and
he
saw
the
opening
he
had
given
her
she
had
two
ways
of
getting
things
out
of
him
against
his
principles
the
tender
wheedling
way
and
the
and
cold
and
he
did
not
know
which
he
dreaded
most
as
a
child
they
had
admired
her
assertiveness
had
made
apex
ring
with
their
boasts
of
it
but
it
had
long
since
cowed
spragg
and
it
was
beginning
to
frighten
her
husband
fact
is
undie
he
said
weakening
i
a
little
mite
strapped
just
this
month
her
eyes
grew
as
they
always
did
when
he
alluded
to
business
that
was
man
province
and
what
did
men
go
down
town
for
but
to
bring
back
the
spoils
to
their
women
she
rose
abruptly
leaving
her
parents
seated
and
said
more
to
herself
than
the
others
think
i
go
for
a
ride
oh
undine
fluttered
spragg
she
always
had
palpitations
when
undine
rode
and
since
the
aaronson
episode
her
fears
were
not
confined
to
what
the
horse
might
do
why
do
you
take
your
mother
out
shopping
a
little
spragg
suggested
conscious
of
the
limitation
of
his
resources
undine
made
no
answer
but
swept
down
the
room
and
out
of
the
door
ahead
of
her
mother
with
scorn
and
anger
in
every
line
of
her
arrogant
young
back
spragg
tottered
meekly
after
her
and
spragg
lounged
out
into
the
marble
hall
to
buy
a
cigar
before
taking
the
subway
to
his
office
undine
went
for
a
ride
not
because
she
felt
particularly
disposed
for
the
exercise
but
because
she
wished
to
discipline
her
mother
she
was
almost
sure
she
would
get
her
opera
box
but
she
did
not
see
why
she
should
have
to
struggle
for
her
rights
and
she
was
especially
annoyed
with
spragg
for
seconding
her
so
if
she
and
her
mother
did
not
hold
together
in
such
crises
she
would
have
twice
the
work
to
do
undine
hated
scenes
she
was
essentially
and
would
have
preferred
to
live
on
terms
of
unbroken
harmony
with
her
parents
but
she
could
not
help
it
if
they
were
unreasonable
ever
since
she
could
remember
there
had
been
fusses
about
money
yet
she
and
her
mother
had
always
got
what
they
wanted
apparently
without
lasting
detriment
to
the
family
fortunes
it
was
therefore
natural
to
conclude
that
there
were
ample
funds
to
draw
upon
and
that
spragg
occasional
resistances
were
merely
due
to
an
imperfect
understanding
of
what
constituted
the
necessities
of
life
when
she
returned
from
her
ride
spragg
received
her
as
if
she
had
come
back
from
the
dead
it
was
absurd
of
course
but
undine
was
inured
to
the
absurdity
of
parents
has
father
telephoned
was
her
first
brief
question
no
he
has
yet
undine
lips
tightened
but
she
proceeded
deliberately
with
the
removal
of
her
habit
you
think
i
asked
him
to
buy
me
the
opera
house
the
way
he
acting
over
a
single
box
she
muttered
flinging
aside
her
coat
spragg
received
the
flying
garment
and
smoothed
it
out
on
the
bed
neither
of
the
ladies
could
bear
to
have
their
maid
about
when
they
were
at
their
toilet
and
spragg
had
always
performed
these
ancillary
services
for
undine
you
know
undie
father
has
always
got
the
money
in
his
pocket
and
the
bills
have
been
pretty
heavy
lately
father
was
a
rich
man
for
apex
but
that
different
from
being
rich
in
new
york
she
stood
before
her
daughter
looking
down
on
her
appealingly
undine
who
had
seated
herself
while
she
detached
her
stock
and
waistcoat
raised
her
head
with
an
impatient
jerk
why
on
earth
did
we
ever
leave
apex
then
she
exclaimed
spragg
eyes
usually
dropped
before
her
daughter
inclement
gaze
but
on
this
occasion
they
held
their
own
with
a
kind
of
courage
till
undine
lids
sank
above
her
flushing
cheeks
she
sprang
up
tugging
at
the
waistband
of
her
habit
while
spragg
relapsing
from
temerity
to
meekness
hovered
about
her
with
obstructive
zeal
if
you
only
just
let
go
of
my
skirt
mother
i
can
unhook
it
twice
as
quick
myself
spragg
drew
back
understanding
that
her
presence
was
no
longer
wanted
but
on
the
threshold
she
paused
as
if
overruled
by
a
stronger
influence
and
said
with
a
last
look
at
her
daughter
you
did
meet
anybody
when
you
were
out
did
you
undie
undine
brows
drew
together
she
was
struggling
with
her
long
boot
meet
anybody
do
you
mean
anybody
i
know
i
do
know
anybody
i
never
shall
if
father
ca
afford
to
let
me
go
round
with
people
the
boot
was
off
with
a
wrench
and
she
flung
it
violently
across
the
carpet
while
spragg
turning
away
to
hide
a
look
of
inexpressible
relief
slipped
discreetly
from
the
room
the
day
wore
on
undine
had
meant
to
go
down
and
tell
mabel
lipscomb
about
the
fairford
dinner
but
its
aftertaste
was
flat
on
her
lips
what
would
it
lead
to
nothing
as
far
as
she
could
see
ralph
marvell
had
not
even
asked
when
he
might
call
and
she
was
ashamed
to
confess
to
mabel
that
he
had
not
driven
home
with
her
suddenly
she
decided
that
she
would
go
and
see
the
pictures
of
which
fairford
had
spoken
perhaps
she
might
meet
some
of
the
people
she
had
seen
at
dinner
from
their
talk
one
might
have
imagined
that
they
spent
their
lives
in
the
thought
reanimated
her
and
she
put
on
her
handsomest
furs
and
a
hat
for
which
she
had
not
yet
dared
present
the
bill
to
her
father
it
was
the
fashionable
hour
in
fifth
avenue
but
undine
knew
none
of
the
ladies
who
were
bowing
to
each
other
from
interlocked
motors
she
had
to
content
herself
with
the
gaze
of
admiration
which
she
left
in
her
wake
along
the
pavement
but
she
was
used
to
the
homage
of
the
streets
and
her
vanity
craved
a
choicer
fare
when
she
reached
the
art
gallery
which
fairford
had
named
she
found
it
even
more
crowded
than
fifth
avenue
and
some
of
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
wedged
before
the
pictures
had
the
look
which
signified
social
consecration
as
undine
made
her
way
among
them
she
was
aware
of
attracting
almost
as
much
notice
as
in
the
street
and
she
flung
herself
into
rapt
attitudes
before
the
canvases
scribbling
notes
in
the
catalogue
in
imitation
of
a
tall
girl
in
sables
while
ripples
of
played
up
and
down
her
watchful
back
presently
her
attention
was
drawn
to
a
lady
in
black
who
was
examining
the
pictures
through
a
adorned
with
diamonds
and
hanging
from
a
long
pearl
chain
undine
was
instantly
struck
by
the
opportunities
which
this
toy
presented
for
graceful
wrist
movements
and
supercilious
turns
of
the
head
it
seemed
suddenly
plebeian
and
promiscuous
to
look
at
the
world
with
a
naked
eye
and
all
her
floating
desires
were
merged
in
the
wish
for
a
jewelled
and
chain
so
violent
was
this
wish
that
drawn
on
in
the
wake
of
the
owner
of
the
she
found
herself
inadvertently
bumping
against
a
stout
young
man
whose
impact
knocked
her
catalogue
from
her
hand
as
the
young
man
picked
the
catalogue
up
and
held
it
out
to
her
she
noticed
that
his
bulging
eyes
and
queer
retreating
face
were
suffused
with
a
glow
of
admiration
he
was
so
that
she
would
have
resented
his
homage
had
not
his
odd
physiognomy
called
up
some
vaguely
agreeable
association
of
ideas
where
had
she
seen
before
this
grotesque
saurian
head
with
as
thick
as
lips
and
lips
as
thick
as
it
fled
before
her
down
a
perspective
of
innumerable
newspaper
portraits
all
like
the
original
before
her
tightly
coated
with
a
huge
pearl
transfixing
a
silken
tie
oh
thank
you
she
murmured
all
gleams
and
graces
while
he
stood
hat
in
hand
saying
sociably
the
crowd
simply
awful
is
it
at
the
same
moment
the
lady
of
the
drifted
closer
and
with
a
tap
of
her
wand
and
a
careless
peter
look
at
this
swept
him
to
the
other
side
of
the
gallery
undine
heart
was
beating
excitedly
for
as
he
turned
away
she
had
identified
him
peter
van
degen
who
could
he
be
but
young
peter
van
degen
the
son
of
the
great
banker
thurber
van
degen
the
husband
of
ralph
marvell
cousin
the
hero
of
sunday
supplements
the
captor
of
blue
ribbons
at
of
gold
cups
at

races
the
owner
of

and
crack
sloops
the
supreme
exponent
in
short
of
those
crowning
arts
that
made
all
life
seem
stale
and
unprofitable
outside
the
magic
ring
of
the
society
column
undine
smiled
as
she
recalled
the
look
with
which
his
pale
protruding
eyes
had
rested
on
her
it
almost
consoled
her
for
his
wife
indifference
when
she
reached
home
she
found
that
she
could
not
remember
anything
about
the
pictures
she
had
seen
there
was
no
message
from
her
father
and
a
reaction
of
disgust
set
in
of
what
good
were
such
encounters
if
they
were
to
have
no
sequel
she
would
probably
never
meet
peter
van
degen
again
or
if
she
did
run
across
him
in
the
same
accidental
way
she
knew
they
could
not
continue
their
conversation
without
being
introduced
what
was
the
use
of
being
beautiful
and
attracting
attention
if
one
were
perpetually
doomed
to
relapse
again
into
the
obscure
mass
of
the
uninvited
her
gloom
was
not
lightened
by
finding
ralph
marvell
card
on
the
table
she
thought
it
unflattering
and
almost
impolite
of
him
to
call
without
making
an
appointment
it
seemed
to
show
that
he
did
not
wish
to
continue
their
acquaintance
but
as
she
tossed
the
card
aside
her
mother
said
he
was
real
sorry
not
to
see
you
undine
he
sat
here
nearly
an
hour
undine
attention
was
roused
sat
here
all
alone
did
you
tell
him
i
was
out
yes
but
he
came
up
all
the
same
he
asked
for
me
asked
for
you
the
social
order
seemed
to
be
falling
in
ruins
at
undine
feet
a
visitor
who
asked
for
a
girl
mother
she
stared
at
spragg
with
cold
incredulity
what
makes
you
think
he
did
why
they
told
me
so
i
telephoned
down
that
you
were
out
and
they
said
he
asked
for
me
spragg
let
the
fact
speak
for
itself
it
was
too
much
out
of
the
range
of
her
experience
to
admit
of
even
a
hypothetical
explanation
undine
shrugged
her
shoulders
it
was
a
mistake
of
course
why
on
earth
did
you
let
him
come
up
i
thought
maybe
he
had
a
message
for
you
undie
this
plea
struck
her
daughter
as
not
without
weight
well
did
he
she
asked
drawing
out
her
and
tossing
down
her
hat
on
the
onyx
table
why
no
he
just
conversed
he
was
lovely
to
me
but
i
could
make
out
what
he
was
after
spragg
was
obliged
to
own
her
daughter
looked
at
her
with
a
kind
of
chill
commiseration
you
never
can
she
murmured
turning
away
she
stretched
herself
out
moodily
on
one
of
the
pink
and
gold
sofas
and
lay
there
brooding
an
unread
novel
on
her
knee
spragg
timidly
slipped
a
cushion
under
her
daughter
head
and
then
dissembled
herself
behind
the
lace
and
sat
watching
the
lights
spring
out
down
the
long
street
and
spread
their
glittering
net
across
the
park
it
was
one
of
spragg
chief
occupations
to
watch
the
nightly
lighting
of
new
york
undine
lay
silent
her
hands
clasped
behind
her
head
she
was
plunged
in
one
of
the
moods
of
bitter
retrospection
when
all
her
past
seemed
like
a
long
struggle
for
something
she
could
not
have
from
a
trip
to
europe
to
an
and
when
she
felt
sure
that
as
the
past
had
been
so
the
future
would
be
and
yet
as
she
had
often
told
her
parents
all
she
sought
for
was
improvement
she
honestly
wanted
the
best
her
first
struggle
after
she
had
ceased
to
scream
for
candy
or
sulk
for
a
new
toy
had
been
to
get
away
from
apex
in
summer
her
summers
as
she
looked
back
on
them
seemed
to
typify
all
that
was
dreariest
and
most
exasperating
in
her
life
the
earliest
had
been
spent
in
the
yellow
frame
cottage
where
she
had
hung
on
the
fence
kicking
her
toes
against
the
broken
palings
and
exchanging
moist
and
apples
with
indiana
frusk
later
on
she
had
returned
from
her
to
the
comparative
gentility
of
summer
vacations
at
the
mealey
house
whither
her
parents
forsaking
their
squalid
suburb
had
moved
in
the
first
flush
of
their
rising
fortunes
the
tessellated
floors
the
plush
parlours
and
radiators
of
the
mealey
house
had
aside
from
their
intrinsic
elegance
the
immense
advantage
of
lifting
the
spraggs
high
above
the
frusks
and
making
it
possible
for
undine
when
she
met
indiana
in
the
street
or
at
school
to
chill
her
advances
by
a
careless
allusion
to
the
splendours
of
hotel
life
but
even
in
such
a
setting
and
in
spite
of
the
social
superiority
it
implied
the
long
months
of
the
middle
western
summer
torrid
exhaling
stale
odours
soon
became
as
insufferable
as
they
had
been
in
the
little
yellow
house
at
school
undine
met
other
girls
whose
parents
took
them
to
the
great
lakes
for
august
some
even
went
to
california
others
oh
bliss
ineffable
went
east
pale
and
listless
under
the
stifling
boredom
of
the
mealey
house
routine
undine
secretly
sucked
lemons
nibbled
and
drank
pints
of
bitter
coffee
to
aggravate
her
look
of
and
when
she
learned
that
even
indiana
frusk
was
to
go
on
a
month
visit
to
buffalo
it
needed
no
artificial
aids
to
emphasize
the
ravages
of
envy
her
parents
alarmed
by
her
appearance
were
at
last
convinced
of
the
necessity
of
change
and
timidly
tentatively
they
transferred
themselves
for
a
month
to
a
staring
hotel
on
a
glaring
lake
there
undine
enjoyed
the
satisfaction
of
sending
ironic
to
indiana
and
discovering
that
she
could
more
than
hold
her
own
against
the
youth
and
beauty
of
the
other
visitors
then
she
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
pretty
woman
from
richmond
whose
husband
a
mining
engineer
had
brought
her
west
with
him
while
he
inspected
the
newly
developed
eubaw
mines
and
the
southern
visitor
dismay
her
repugnances
her
recoil
from
the
faces
the
food
the
amusements
the
general
bareness
and
stridency
of
the
scene
were
a
terrible
initiation
to
undine
there
was
something
still
better
beyond
then
more
luxurious
more
exciting
more
worthy
of
her
she
once
said
to
herself
afterward
that
it
was
always
her
fate
to
find
out
just
too
late
about
the
something
beyond
but
in
this
case
it
was
not
too
late
and
obstinately
inflexibly
she
set
herself
to
the
task
of
forcing
her
parents
to
take
her
east
the
next
summer
yielding
to
the
inevitable
they
suffered
themselves
to
be
impelled
to
a
virginia
resort
where
undine
had
her
first
glimpse
of
more
romantic
possibilities
leafy
moonlight
rides
and
drives
picnics
in
mountain
glades
and
an
atmosphere
of
sentimentality
that
tempered
her
hard
edges
a
little
and
gave
her
glimpses
of
a
more
delicate
kind
of
pleasure
but
here
again
everything
was
spoiled
by
a
peep
through
another
door
undine
after
a
first
mustering
of
the
other
girls
in
the
hotel
had
as
usual
found
herself
easily
first
till
the
arrival
from
washington
of
and
wincher
and
their
daughter
undine
was
much
handsomer
than
miss
wincher
but
she
saw
at
a
glance
that
she
did
not
know
how
to
use
her
beauty
as
the
other
used
her
plainness
she
was
exasperated
too
by
the
discovery
that
miss
wincher
seemed
not
only
unconscious
of
any
possible
rivalry
between
them
but
actually
unaware
of
her
existence
listless
supercilious
the
young
lady
from
washington
sat
apart
reading
novels
or
playing
solitaire
with
her
parents
as
though
the
huge
hotel
loud
life
of
gossip
and
flirtation
were
invisible
and
inaudible
to
her
undine
never
even
succeeded
in
catching
her
eye
she
always
lowered
it
to
her
book
when
the
apex
beauty
trailed
or
rattled
past
her
secluded
corner
but
one
day
an
acquaintance
of
the
winchers
turned
up
a
lady
from
boston
who
had
come
to
virginia
on
a
botanizing
tour
and
from
scraps
of
miss
wincher
conversation
with
the
newcomer
undine
straining
her
ears
behind
a
column
of
the
long
veranda
obtained
a
new
glimpse
into
the
unimagined
the
winchers
it
appeared
found
themselves
at
potash
springs
merely
because
a
severe
illness
of
wincher
had
made
it
impossible
at
the
last
moment
to
move
her
farther
from
washington
they
had
let
their
house
on
the
north
shore
and
as
soon
as
they
could
leave
this
dreadful
hole
were
going
to
europe
for
the
autumn
miss
wincher
simply
know
how
she
got
through
the
days
though
no
doubt
it
was
as
good
as
a
after
the
rush
of
the
winter
of
course
they
would
have
preferred
to
hire
a
house
but
the
hole
if
one
could
believe
it
did
offer
one
so
they
had
simply
shut
themselves
off
as
best
they
could
from
the
hotel
crew
had
her
friend
miss
wincher
parenthetically
asked
happened
to
notice
the
sunday
young
men
they
were
queerer
even
than
the
belles
they
came
for
and
had
escaped
the
promiscuity
of
the
by
turning
one
of
their
rooms
into
a
and
picnicking
there
with
the
persimmon
house
standards
one
could
describe
it
in
any
other
way
but
luckily
the
awful
place
was
doing
mamma
good
and
now
they
had
nearly
served
their
term
undine
turned
sick
as
she
listened
only
the
evening
before
she
had
gone
on
a
with
a
young
gentleman
from
deposit
a
assistant
and
had
let
him
kiss
her
and
given
him
the
flower
from
her
hair
she
loathed
the
thought
of
him
now
she
loathed
all
the
people
about
her
and
most
of
all
the
disdainful
miss
wincher
it
enraged
her
to
think
that
the
winchers
classed
her
with
the
hotel
crew
with
the
belles
who
awaited
their
sunday
young
men
the
place
was
forever
blighted
for
her
and
the
next
week
she
dragged
her
amazed
but
thankful
parents
back
to
apex
but
miss
wincher
depreciatory
talk
had
opened
ampler
vistas
and
the
pioneer
blood
in
undine
would
not
let
her
rest
she
had
heard
the
call
of
the
atlantic
seaboard
and
the
next
summer
found
the
spraggs
at
skog
harbour
maine
even
now
undine
felt
a
shiver
of
boredom
as
she
recalled
it
that
summer
had
been
the
worst
of
all
the
bare
inn
all
shingles
without
and
blueberry
pie
within
was
exclusive
parochial
bostonian
and
the
spraggs
wore
through
the
interminable
weeks
in
blank
unmitigated
isolation
the
incomprehensible
part
of
it
was
that
every
other
woman
in
the
hotel
was
plain
dowdy
or
elderly
and
most
of
them
all
three
if
there
had
been
any
competition
on
ordinary
lines
undine
would
have
won
as
van
degen
said
hands
down
but
there
was
the
other
guests
simply
formed
a
cold
impenetrable
group
who
walked
boated
played
golf
and
discussed
christian
science
and
the
subliminal
unaware
of
the
tremulous
organism
drifting
helplessly
against
their
circle
it
was
on
the
day
the
spraggs
left
skog
harbour
that
undine
vowed
to
herself
with
set
lips
i
never
try
anything
again
till
i
try
new
york
now
she
had
gained
her
point
and
tried
new
york
and
so
far
it
seemed
with
no
better
success
from
small
things
to
great
everything
went
against
her
in
such
hours
of
she
was
ready
enough
to
acknowledge
her
own
mistakes
but
they
exasperated
her
less
than
the
blunders
of
her
parents
she
was
sure
for
instance
that
she
was
on
what
heeny
called
the
right
tack
at
last
yet
just
at
the
moment
when
her
luck
seemed
about
to
turn
she
was
to
be
thwarted
by
her
father
stupid
obstinacy
about
the
she
lay
brooding
over
these
things
till
long
after
spragg
had
gone
away
to
dress
for
dinner
and
it
was
nearly
eight
when
she
heard
her
father
dragging
tread
in
the
hall
she
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
her
book
while
he
entered
the
room
and
moved
about
behind
her
laying
aside
his
hat
and
overcoat
then
his
steps
came
close
and
a
small
parcel
dropped
on
the
pages
of
her
book
oh
father
she
sprang
up
all
alight
the
novel
on
the
floor
her
fingers
twitching
for
the
tickets
but
a
substantial
packet
emerged
like
nothing
she
had
ever
seen
she
looked
at
it
hoping
fearing
she
beamed
blissful
interrogation
on
her
father
while
his
sallow
smile
continued
to
tantalize
her
then
she
closed
on
him
with
a
rush
smothering
his
words
against
her
hair
it
for
more
than
one
night
why
it
for
every
other
friday
oh
you
darling
you
darling
she
exulted
spragg
through
the
glittering
meshes
feigned
dismay
that
so
they
must
have
given
me
the
wrong
then
convicted
by
her
radiant
eyes
as
she
swung
round
on
him
i
knew
you
only
wanted
it
once
for
yourself
undine
but
i
thought
maybe
off
nights
you
like
to
send
it
to
your
friends
spragg
who
from
her
doorway
had
assisted
with
moist
eyes
at
this
closing
pleasantry
came
forward
as
undine
hurried
away
to
dress
abner
can
you
really
manage
it
all
right
he
answered
her
with
one
of
his
awkward
brief
caresses
do
you
fret
about
that
leota
i
bound
to
have
her
go
round
with
these
people
she
knows
i
want
her
to
be
with
them
all
she
can
a
pause
fell
between
them
while
spragg
looked
anxiously
into
his
fagged
eyes
you
seen
elmer
again
no
once
was
enough
he
returned
with
a
scowl
like
undine
why
you
said
he
could
come
after
her
abner
no
more
he
can
but
what
if
she
was
to
get
nervous
and
lonesome
and
want
to
go
after
him
spragg
shuddered
away
from
the
suggestion
how
he
look
just
the
same
she
whispered
no
spruced
up
that
what
scared
me
it
scared
her
too
to
the
point
of
blanching
her
habitually
lifeless
cheek
she
continued
to
scrutinize
her
husband
broodingly
you
look
fairly
sick
abner
you
better
let
me
get
you
some
of
those
stomach
drops
right
off
she
proposed
but
he
parried
this
with
his
unfailing
humour
i
guess
i
too
sick
to
risk
that
he
passed
his
hand
through
her
arm
with
the
conjugal
gesture
familiar
to
apex
city
come
along
down
to
dinner
mother
i
guess
undine
wo
mind
if
i
do
rig
up
v
she
had
looked
down
at
them
enviously
from
the
balcony
she
had
looked
up
at
them
reverentially
from
the
stalls
but
now
at
last
she
was
on
a
line
with
them
among
them
she
was
part
of
the
sacred
semicircle
whose
privilege
it
is
between
the
acts
to
make
the
mere
public
forget
that
the
curtain
has
fallen
as
she
swept
to
the
seat
of
their
crimson
niche
waving
mabel
lipscomb
to
the
opposite
corner
with
a
gesture
learned
during
her
apprenticeship
in
the
stalls
undine
felt
that
quickening
of
the
faculties
that
comes
in
the
high
moments
of
life
her
consciousness
seemed
to
take
in
at
once
the
whole
bright
curve
of
the
auditorium
from
the
unbroken
lines
of
spectators
below
her
to
the
culminating
blaze
of
the
central
chandelier
and
she
herself
was
the
core
of
that
vast
illumination
the
sentient
throbbing
surface
which
gathered
all
the
shafts
of
light
into
a
centre
it
was
almost
a
relief
when
a
moment
later
the
lights
sank
the
curtain
rose
and
the
focus
of
illumination
was
shifted
the
music
the
scenery
and
the
movement
on
the
stage
were
like
a
rich
mist
tempering
the
radiance
that
shot
on
her
from
every
side
and
giving
her
time
to
subside
draw
breath
adjust
herself
to
this
new
clear
medium
which
made
her
feel
so
oddly
brittle
and
transparent
when
the
curtain
fell
on
the
first
act
she
began
to
be
aware
of
a
subtle
change
in
the
house
in
all
the
boxes
of
movement
had
set
in
groups
were
coalescing
and
breaking
up
fans
waving
and
heads
twinkling
black
coats
emerging
among
white
shoulders
late
comers
dropping
their
furs
and
laces
in
the
red
penumbra
of
the
background
undine
for
the
moment
unconscious
of
herself
swept
the
house
with
her
searching
for
familiar
faces
some
she
knew
without
being
able
to
name
them
fixed
of
the
social
prow
others
she
recognized
from
their
portraits
in
the
papers
but
of
the
few
from
whom
she
could
herself
claim
recognition
not
one
was
visible
and
as
she
pursued
her
investigations
the
whole
scene
grew
blank
and
featureless
almost
all
the
boxes
were
full
now
but
one
just
opposite
tantalized
her
by
its
continued
emptiness
how
queer
to
have
an
and
not
use
it
what
on
earth
could
the
people
be
doing
what
rarer
delight
could
they
be
tasting
undine
remembered
that
the
numbers
of
the
boxes
and
the
names
of
their
owners
were
given
on
the
back
of
the
programme
and
after
a
rapid
computation
she
turned
to
consult
the
list
mondays
and
fridays
peter
van
degen
that
was
it
the
box
was
empty
because
van
degen
was
dining
alone
with
ralph
marvell
peter
will
be
at
one
of
his
dinners
undine
had
a
sharp
vision
of
the
van
degen
she
pictured
it
as
and
sumptuous
with
gilding
with
a
small
table
in
the
centre
and
rosy
lights
and
flowers
and
ralph
marvell
across
the
grapes
and
champagne
leaning
to
take
a
light
from
his
hostess
cigarette
undine
had
seen
such
scenes
on
the
stage
she
had
come
upon
them
in
the
glowing
pages
of
fiction
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
every
detail
was
before
her
now
from
the
glitter
of
jewels
on
van
degen
bare
shoulders
to
the
way
young
marvell
stroked
his
slight
blond
moustache
while
he
smiled
and
listened
undine
blushed
with
anger
at
her
own
simplicity
in
fancying
that
he
had
been
taken
by
her
that
she
could
ever
really
count
among
these
happy
people
they
all
had
their
friends
their
ties
their
delightful
crowding
obligations
why
should
they
make
room
for
an
intruder
in
a
circle
so
packed
with
the
initiated
as
her
imagination
developed
the
details
of
the
scene
in
the
van
degen
it
became
clear
to
her
that
fashionable
society
was
horribly
immoral
and
that
she
could
never
really
be
happy
in
such
a
poisoned
atmosphere
she
remembered
that
an
eminent
divine
was
preaching
a
series
of
sermons
against
social
corruption
and
she
determined
to
go
and
hear
him
on
the
following
sunday
this
train
of
thought
was
interrupted
by
the
feeling
that
she
was
being
intently
observed
from
the
neighbouring
box
she
turned
around
with
a
feint
of
speaking
to
lipscomb
and
met
the
bulging
stare
of
peter
van
degen
he
was
standing
behind
the
lady
of
the
who
had
replaced
her
implement
by
one
of
brilliants
which
at
word
from
her
companion
she
critically
bent
on
undine
no
i
do
remember
she
said
and
the
girl
reddened
divining
herself
unidentified
after
this
protracted
scrutiny
but
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
young
van
degen
remembering
her
she
was
even
conscious
that
he
was
trying
to
provoke
in
her
some
reciprocal
sign
of
recognition
and
the
attempt
drove
her
to
the
haughty
study
of
her
programme
why
there
popple
over
there
exclaimed
mabel
lipscomb
making
large
signs
across
the
house
with
fan
and
undine
had
already
become
aware
that
mabel
planted
blond
and
brimming
too
near
the
edge
of
the
box
was
somehow
out
of
scale
and
out
of
drawing
and
the
freedom
of
her
demonstrations
increased
the
effect
of
disproportion
no
one
else
was
wagging
and
waving
in
that
way
a
gestureless
mute
telegraphy
seemed
to
pass
between
the
other
boxes
still
undine
could
not
help
following
lipscomb
glance
and
there
in
fact
was
claud
popple
taller
and
more
dominant
than
ever
and
bending
easily
over
what
she
felt
must
be
the
back
of
a
brilliant
woman
he
replied
by
a
discreet
salute
to
lipscomb
intemperate
motions
and
undine
saw
the
brilliant
woman
turn
in
their
direction
and
said
to
herself
that
in
a
moment
popple
would
be
round
but
the
wore
on
and
no
one
turned
the
handle
of
their
door
or
disturbed
the
peaceful
somnolence
of
harry
lipscomb
who
not
being
as
he
put
it
onto
grand
opera
had
abandoned
the
struggle
and
withdrawn
to
the
seclusion
of
the
inner
box
undine
jealously
watched
popple
progress
from
box
to
box
from
brilliant
woman
to
brilliant
woman
but
just
as
it
seemed
about
to
carry
him
to
their
door
he
reappeared
at
his
original
post
across
the
house
undie
do
look
there
mr
marvell
mabel
began
again
with
another
conspicuous
outbreak
of
signalling
and
this
time
undine
flushed
to
the
nape
as
peter
van
degen
appeared
in
the
opposite
box
with
ralph
marvell
behind
her
the
two
seemed
to
be
alone
in
the
box
as
they
had
doubtless
been
alone
all
the
evening
and
undine
furtively
turned
to
see
if
van
degen
shared
her
disapproval
but
van
degen
had
disappeared
and
undine
leaning
forward
nervously
touched
mabel
arm
what
the
matter
undine
do
you
see
marvell
over
there
is
that
his
sister
he
with
i
would
beckon
like
that
undine
whispered
between
her
teeth
why
not
do
you
want
him
to
know
you
here
yes
but
the
other
people
are
not
beckoning
mabel
looked
about
unabashed
perhaps
they
all
found
each
other
shall
i
send
harry
over
to
tell
him
she
shouted
above
the
blare
of
the
wind
instruments
no
gasped
undine
as
the
curtain
rose
she
was
no
longer
capable
of
following
the
action
on
the
stage
two
presences
possessed
her
imagination
that
of
ralph
marvell
small
unattainable
remote
and
that
of
mabel
lipscomb
immense
and
irrepressible
it
had
become
clear
to
undine
that
mabel
lipscomb
was
ridiculous
that
was
the
reason
why
popple
did
not
come
to
the
box
no
one
would
care
to
be
seen
talking
to
her
while
mabel
was
at
her
side
mabel
monumental
and
moulded
while
the
fashionable
were
flexible
and
diaphanous
mabel
strident
and
explicit
while
they
were
subdued
and
allusive
at
the
stentorian
she
was
the
centre
of
her
group
here
she
revealed
herself
as
unknown
and
unknowing
why
she
did
even
know
that
peter
van
degen
was
not
ralph
marvell
sister
and
she
had
a
way
of
trumpeting
out
her
ignorances
that
jarred
on
undine
subtler
methods
it
was
precisely
at
this
point
that
there
dawned
on
undine
what
was
to
be
one
of
the
guiding
principles
of
her
career
it
better
to
watch
than
to
ask
questions
the
curtain
fell
again
and
undine
eyes
flew
back
to
the
van
degen
box
several
men
were
entering
it
together
and
a
moment
later
she
saw
ralph
marvell
rise
from
his
seat
and
pass
out
she
placed
herself
in
such
a
way
as
to
have
an
eye
on
the
door
of
the
box
but
its
handle
remained
unturned
and
harry
lipscomb
leaning
back
on
the
sofa
his
head
against
the
opera
cloaks
continued
to
breathe
stentorously
through
his
open
mouth
and
stretched
his
legs
a
little
farther
across
the
threshold
the
was
nearly
over
when
the
door
opened
and
two
gentlemen
stumbled
over
lipscomb
legs
the
foremost
was
claud
walsingham
popple
and
above
his
shoulder
shone
the
batrachian
countenance
of
peter
van
degen
a
brief
murmur
from
popple
made
his
companion
known
to
the
two
ladies
and
van
degen
promptly
seated
himself
behind
undine
relegating
the
painter
to
lipscomb
elbow
queer
go
i
happened
to
see
your
friend
there
waving
to
old
popp
across
the
house
so
i
bolted
over
and
collared
him
told
him
he
got
to
introduce
me
before
he
was
a
minute
older
i
tried
to
find
out
who
you
were
the
other
day
at
the
motor
show
no
where
was
it
oh
those
pictures
at
goldmark
what
think
of
by
the
way
you
ought
to
be
painted
yourself
no
i
mean
it
you
know
you
ought
to
get
old
popp
to
do
you
he
do
your
hair
ripplingly
you
must
let
me
come
and
talk
to
you
about
it
about
the
picture
or
your
hair
well
your
hair
if
you
do
mind
where
you
say
you
were
staying
oh
you
live
here
do
you
i
say
that
first
rate
undine
sat
well
forward
curving
toward
him
a
little
as
she
had
seen
the
other
women
do
but
holding
back
sufficiently
to
let
it
be
visible
to
the
house
that
she
was
conversing
with
no
less
a
person
than
peter
van
degen
popple
talk
was
certainly
more
brilliant
and
purposeful
and
she
saw
him
cast
longing
glances
at
her
from
behind
lipscomb
shoulder
but
she
remembered
how
lightly
he
had
been
treated
at
the
fairford
dinner
and
she
wanted
oh
how
she
wanted
to
have
ralph
marvell
see
her
talking
to
van
degen
she
poured
out
her
heart
to
him
improvising
an
opinion
on
the
pictures
and
an
opinion
on
the
music
falling
in
gaily
with
his
suggestion
of
a
jolly
little
dinner
some
night
soon
at
the
café
martin
and
strengthening
her
position
as
she
thought
by
an
easy
allusion
to
her
acquaintance
with
van
degen
but
at
the
word
her
companion
eye
clouded
and
a
shade
of
constraint
dimmed
his
enterprising
smile
my
wife
oh
she
does
go
to
restaurants
she
moves
on
too
high
a
plane
but
we
get
old
popp
and
what
you
say
your
fat
friend
name
was
just
a
select
little
crowd
of
four
and
some
kind
of
a
cheerful
show
afterward
jove
there
the
curtain
and
i
must
skip
as
the
door
closed
on
him
undine
cheeks
burned
with
resentment
if
van
degen
did
go
to
restaurants
why
had
he
supposed
that
she
would
and
to
have
to
drag
mabel
in
her
wake
the
leaden
sense
of
failure
overcame
her
again
here
was
the
evening
nearly
over
and
what
had
it
led
to
looking
up
from
the
stalls
she
had
fancied
that
to
sit
in
a
box
was
to
be
in
society
now
she
saw
it
might
but
emphasize
exclusion
and
she
was
burdened
with
the
box
for
the
rest
of
the
season
it
was
really
stupid
of
her
father
to
have
exceeded
his
instructions
why
had
he
not
done
as
she
told
him
undine
felt
helpless
and
tired
hateful
memories
of
apex
crowded
back
on
her
was
it
going
to
be
as
dreary
here
as
there
she
felt
lipscomb
loud
whisper
in
her
back
say
you
girls
i
guess
i
cut
this
and
come
back
for
you
when
the
show
busts
up
they
heard
him
shuffle
out
of
the
box
and
mabel
settled
back
to
undisturbed
enjoyment
of
the
stage
when
the
last
began
undine
stood
up
resolved
to
stay
no
longer
mabel
lost
in
the
study
of
the
audience
had
not
noticed
her
movement
and
as
she
passed
alone
into
the
back
of
the
box
the
door
opened
and
ralph
marvell
came
in
undine
stood
with
one
arm
listlessly
raised
to
detach
her
cloak
from
the
wall
her
attitude
showed
the
long
slimness
of
her
figure
and
the
fresh
curve
of
the
throat
below
her
head
her
face
was
paler
and
softer
than
usual
and
the
eyes
she
rested
on
marvell
face
looked
deep
and
starry
under
their
fixed
brows
oh
you
not
going
he
exclaimed
i
thought
you
were
coming
she
answered
simply
i
waited
till
now
on
purpose
to
dodge
your
other
visitors
she
laughed
with
pleasure
oh
we
had
so
many
some
intuition
had
already
told
her
that
frankness
was
the
tone
to
take
with
him
they
sat
down
together
on
the
red
damask
sofa
against
the
hanging
cloaks
as
undine
leaned
back
her
hair
caught
in
the
spangles
of
the
wrap
behind
her
and
she
had
to
sit
motionless
while
the
young
man
freed
the
captive
mesh
then
they
settled
themselves
again
laughing
a
little
at
the
incident
a
glance
had
made
the
situation
clear
to
lipscomb
and
they
saw
her
return
to
her
rapt
inspection
of
the
boxes
in
their
recess
the
light
was
subdued
to
a
rosy
dimness
and
the
hum
of
the
audience
came
to
them
through
silken
curtains
undine
noticed
the
delicacy
and
finish
of
her
companion
features
as
his
head
detached
itself
against
the
red
silk
walls
the
hand
with
which
he
stroked
his
small
moustache
was
too
but
sinewy
and
not
effeminate
she
had
always
associated
finish
and
refinement
entirely
with
her
own
sex
but
she
began
to
think
they
might
be
even
more
agreeable
in
a
man
marvell
eyes
were
grey
like
her
own
with
chestnut
eyebrows
and
darker
lashes
and
his
skin
was
as
clear
as
a
woman
but
pleasantly
reddish
like
his
hands
as
he
sat
talking
in
a
low
tone
questioning
her
about
the
music
asking
her
what
she
had
been
doing
since
he
had
last
seen
her
she
was
aware
that
he
looked
at
her
less
than
usual
and
she
also
glanced
away
but
when
she
turned
her
eyes
suddenly
they
always
met
his
gaze
his
talk
remained
impersonal
she
was
a
little
disappointed
that
he
did
not
compliment
her
on
her
dress
or
her
hair
undine
was
accustomed
to
hearing
a
great
deal
about
her
hair
and
the
episode
of
the
spangles
had
opened
the
way
to
a
graceful
allusion
but
the
instinct
of
sex
told
her
that
under
his
quiet
words
he
was
throbbing
with
the
sense
of
her
proximity
and
his
sobered
her
made
her
refrain
from
the
flashing
and
fidgeting
which
were
the
only
way
she
knew
of
taking
part
in
the
immemorial
she
talked
simply
and
frankly
of
herself
of
her
parents
of
how
few
people
they
knew
in
new
york
and
of
how
at
times
she
was
almost
sorry
she
had
persuaded
them
to
give
up
apex
you
see
they
did
it
entirely
on
my
account
they
awfully
lonesome
here
and
i
do
believe
i
shall
ever
learn
new
york
ways
either
she
confessed
turning
on
him
the
eyes
of
youth
and
truthfulness
of
course
i
know
a
few
people
but
they
not
not
the
way
i
expected
new
york
people
to
be
she
risked
what
seemed
an
involuntary
glance
at
mabel
i
seen
girls
here
that
i
just
long
to
know
they
look
so
lovely
and
refined
but
i
do
suppose
i
ever
shall
new
york
not
very
friendly
to
strange
girls
is
it
i
suppose
you
got
so
many
of
your
own
already
and
they
all
so
fascinating
you
do
care
as
she
spoke
she
let
her
eyes
rest
on
his
and
then
dropped
her
lashes
while
the
pink
stole
slowly
up
to
them
when
he
left
her
he
asked
if
he
might
hope
to
find
her
at
home
the
next
day
the
night
was
fine
and
marvell
having
put
his
cousin
into
her
motor
started
to
walk
home
to
washington
square
at
the
corner
he
was
joined
by
popple
hallo
ralph
old
man
did
you
run
across
our
auburn
beauty
of
the
stentorian
who
have
thought
old
harry
lipscomb
have
put
us
onto
anything
as
good
as
that
peter
van
degen
was
fairly
taken
off
his
feet
pulled
me
out
of
monty
thurber
box
and
dragged
me
by
the
collar
to
introduce
him
planning
a
dinner
at
already
gad
young
peter
must
have
what
he
wants
when
he
wants
it
i
put
in
a
word
for
you
told
him
you
and
i
ought
to
be
let
in
on
the
ground
floor
funny
the
luck
some
girls
have
about
getting
started
i
believe
this
one
take
if
she
can
manage
to
shake
the
lipscombs
i
think
i
ask
to
paint
her
might
be
a
good
thing
for
the
spring
show
she
show
up
splendidly
as
a
pendant
to
my
van
degen
blonde
and
brunette
night
and
morning
of
course
i
prefer
van
type
personally
i
must
have
breeding
but
as
a
mere
bit
of
flesh
and
blood
hallo
ai
you
coming
into
the
club
marvell
was
not
coming
into
the
club
and
he
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
as
his
companion
left
him
was
it
possible
that
he
had
ever
thought
leniently
of
the
egregious
popple
the
tone
of
social
omniscience
which
he
had
once
found
so
comic
was
now
as
offensive
to
him
as
a
coarse
physical
touch
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
popple
with
the
slight
exaggeration
of
a
caricature
really
expressed
the
ideals
of
the
world
he
frequented
as
he
spoke
of
miss
spragg
so
others
at
any
rate
would
think
of
her
almost
every
one
in
ralph
set
would
agree
that
it
was
luck
for
a
girl
from
apex
to
be
started
by
peter
van
degen
at
a
café
martin
dinner
ralph
marvell
mounting
his
grandfather
doorstep
looked
up
at
the
symmetrical
old
red
with
its
frugal
marble
ornament
as
he
might
have
looked
into
a
familiar
human
face
they
right
after
all
in
some
ways
they
right
he
murmured
slipping
his
key
into
the
door
they
were
his
mother
and
old
urban
dagonet
both
from
earliest
memories
so
closely
identified
with
the
old
house
in
washington
square
that
they
might
have
passed
for
its
inner
consciousness
as
it
might
have
stood
for
their
outward
form
and
the
question
as
to
which
the
house
now
seemed
to
affirm
their
intrinsic
rightness
was
that
of
the
social
disintegration
expressed
by
architectural
physiognomies
at
the
other
end
of
fifth
avenue
as
ralph
pushed
the
bolts
behind
him
and
passed
into
the
hall
with
its
dark
mahogany
doors
and
the
quiet
dutch
interior
effect
of
its
black
and
white
marble
paving
he
said
to
himself
that
what
popple
called
society
was
really
just
like
the
houses
it
lived
in
a
muddle
of
misapplied
ornament
over
a
thin
steel
shell
of
utility
the
steel
shell
was
built
up
in
wall
street
the
social
trimmings
were
hastily
added
in
fifth
avenue
and
the
union
between
them
was
as
monstrous
and
factitious
as
unlike
the
gradual
homogeneous
growth
which
flowers
into
what
other
countries
know
as
society
as
that
between
the
blois
gargoyles
on
peter
van
degen
roof
and
the
skeleton
walls
supporting
them
that
was
what
they
had
always
said
what
at
least
the
dagonet
attitude
the
dagonet
view
of
life
the
very
lines
of
the
furniture
in
the
old
dagonet
house
expressed
ralph
sometimes
called
his
mother
and
grandfather
the
aborigines
and
likened
them
to
those
vanishing
denizens
of
the
american
continent
doomed
to
rapid
extinction
with
the
advance
of
the
invading
race
he
was
fond
of
describing
washington
square
as
the
reservation
and
of
prophesying
that
before
long
its
inhabitants
would
be
exhibited
at
ethnological
shows
pathetically
engaged
in
the
exercise
of
their
primitive
industries
small
cautious
had
been
the
ideals
of
aboriginal
new
york
but
it
suddenly
struck
the
young
man
that
they
were
singularly
coherent
and
respectable
as
contrasted
with
the
chaos
of
indiscriminate
appetites
which
made
up
its
modern
tendencies
he
too
had
wanted
to
be
modern
had
revolted
against
the
restrictions
and
exclusions
of
the
old
code
and
it
must
have
been
by
one
of
the
ironic
reversions
of
heredity
that
at
this
precise
point
he
began
to
see
what
there
was
to
be
said
on
the
other
side
his
side
as
he
now
felt
it
to
be
vi
upstairs
in
his
brown
firelit
room
he
threw
himself
into
an
armchair
and
remembered
harvard
first
then
oxford
then
a
year
of
wandering
and
rich
initiation
returning
to
new
york
he
had
read
law
and
now
had
his
desk
in
the
office
of
the
respectable
firm
in
whose
charge
the
dagonet
estate
had
mouldered
for
several
generations
but
his
profession
was
the
least
real
thing
in
his
life
the
realities
lay
about
him
now
the
books
jamming
his
old
college
bookcases
and
overflowing
on
chairs
and
tables
sketches
too
he
could
do
charming
things
if
only
he
had
known
how
to
finish
them
and
on
the
at
his
elbow
scattered
sheets
of
prose
and
verse
charming
things
also
but
like
the
sketches
unfinished
nothing
in
the
dagonet
and
marvell
tradition
was
opposed
to
this
desultory
dabbling
with
life
for
four
or
five
generations
it
had
been
the
rule
of
both
houses
that
a
young
fellow
should
go
to
columbia
or
harvard
read
law
and
then
lapse
into
more
or
less
cultivated
inaction
the
only
essential
was
that
he
should
live
like
a
gentleman
that
is
with
a
tranquil
disdain
for
mere
a
passive
openness
to
the
finer
sensations
one
or
two
fixed
principles
as
to
the
quality
of
wine
and
an
archaic
probity
that
had
not
yet
learned
to
distinguish
between
private
and
business
honour
no
equipment
could
more
thoroughly
have
unfitted
the
modern
youth
for
getting
on
it
hardly
needed
the
scribbled
pages
on
the
desk
to
complete
the
hopelessness
of
ralph
marvell
case
he
had
accepted
the
fact
with
a
humorous
fatalism
material
resources
were
limited
on
both
sides
of
the
house
but
there
would
always
be
enough
for
his
frugal
wants
enough
to
buy
books
not
editions
and
pay
now
and
then
for
a
holiday
dash
to
the
great
centres
of
art
and
ideas
and
meanwhile
there
was
the
world
of
wonders
within
him
as
a
boy
at
the
ralph
between
tides
had
once
come
on
a
cave
a
secret
inaccessible
place
with
glaucous
lights
mysterious
murmurs
and
a
single
shaft
of
communication
with
the
sky
he
had
kept
his
find
from
the
other
boys
not
churlishly
for
he
was
always
an
outspoken
lad
but
because
he
felt
there
were
things
about
the
cave
that
the
others
good
fellows
as
they
all
were
could
be
expected
to
understand
and
that
anyhow
it
would
never
be
quite
his
cave
again
after
he
had
let
his
freckled
cousins
play
smuggler
and
pirate
in
it
and
so
with
his
inner
world
though
so
coloured
by
outer
impressions
it
wove
a
secret
curtain
about
him
and
he
came
and
went
in
it
with
the
same
joy
of
furtive
possession
one
day
of
course
some
one
would
discover
it
and
reign
there
with
him
no
reign
over
it
and
him
once
or
twice
already
a
light
foot
had
reached
the
threshold
his
cousin
clare
dagonet
for
instance
there
had
been
a
summer
when
her
voice
had
sounded
far
down
the
windings
but
he
had
run
over
to
spain
for
the
autumn
and
when
he
came
back
she
was
engaged
to
peter
van
degen
and
for
a
while
it
looked
black
in
the
cave
that
was
long
ago
as
time
is
reckoned
under
thirty
and
for
three
years
now
he
had
felt
for
her
only
a
pity
to
have
stood
at
the
mouth
of
his
cave
and
have
turned
from
it
to
the
van
degen
lair
poor
clare
repented
indeed
she
wanted
it
clearly
but
she
repented
in
the
van
degen
diamonds
and
the
van
degen
motor
bore
her
broken
heart
from
opera
to
ball
she
had
been
subdued
to
what
she
worked
in
and
she
could
never
again
find
her
way
to
the
enchanted
cave
ralph
since
then
had
reached
the
point
of
deciding
that
he
would
never
marry
reached
it
not
suddenly
or
dramatically
but
with
such
sober
advisedness
as
is
urged
on
those
about
to
take
the
opposite
step
what
he
most
wanted
now
that
the
first
flutter
of
being
was
over
was
to
learn
and
to
do
to
know
what
the
great
people
had
thought
think
about
their
thinking
and
then
launch
his
own
boat
write
some
good
verse
if
possible
if
not
then
critical
prose
a
dramatic
poem
lay
among
the
stuff
at
his
elbow
but
the
prose
critic
was
at
his
elbow
too
and
not
to
be
satisfied
about
the
poem
and
poet
and
critic
passed
the
nights
in
hot
if
unproductive
debate
on
the
whole
it
seemed
likely
that
the
critic
would
win
the
day
and
the
essay
on
the
rhythmical
structures
of
walt
whitman
take
shape
before
the
banished
god
yet
if
the
light
in
the
cave
was
less
supernaturally
blue
the
chant
of
its
tides
less
laden
with
unimaginable
music
it
was
still
a
thronged
and
echoing
place
when
undine
spragg
appeared
on
its
threshold
his
mother
and
sister
of
course
wanted
him
to
marry
they
had
the
usual
theory
that
he
was
made
for
conjugal
bliss
women
always
thought
that
of
a
fellow
who
did
get
drunk
and
have
low
tastes
ralph
smiled
at
the
idea
as
he
sat
crouched
among
his
secret
treasures
marry
but
whom
in
the
name
of
light
and
freedom
the
daughters
of
his
own
race
sold
themselves
to
the
invaders
the
daughters
of
the
invaders
bought
their
husbands
as
they
bought
an
it
ought
all
to
have
been
transacted
on
the
stock
exchange
his
mother
he
knew
had
no
such
ambitions
for
him
she
would
have
liked
him
to
fancy
a
nice
girl
like
harriet
ray
harriet
ray
was
neither
vulgar
nor
ambitious
she
regarded
washington
square
as
the
birthplace
of
society
knew
by
heart
all
the
cousinships
of
early
new
york
hated
could
not
make
herself
understood
on
the
telephone
and
was
determined
if
she
married
never
to
receive
a
divorced
woman
as
marvell
often
said
such
girls
as
harriet
were
growing
rare
ralph
was
not
sure
about
this
he
was
inclined
to
think
that
certain
modifications
allowed
for
there
would
always
be
plenty
of
harriet
rays
for
unworldly
mothers
to
commend
to
their
sons
and
he
had
no
desire
to
diminish
their
number
by
removing
one
from
the
ranks
of
the
marriageable
he
had
no
desire
to
marry
at
all
that
had
been
the
whole
truth
of
it
till
he
met
undine
spragg
and
now
he
lit
a
cigar
and
began
to
recall
his
hour
conversation
with
spragg
ralph
had
never
taken
his
mother
social
faiths
very
seriously
surveying
the
march
of
civilization
from
a
loftier
angle
he
had
early
mingled
with
the
invaders
and
curiously
observed
their
rites
and
customs
but
most
of
those
he
had
met
had
already
been
modified
by
contact
with
the
indigenous
they
spoke
the
same
language
as
his
though
on
their
lips
it
had
often
so
different
a
meaning
ralph
had
never
seen
them
actually
in
the
making
before
they
had
acquired
the
speech
of
the
conquered
race
but
spragg
still
used
the
dialect
of
her
people
and
before
the
end
of
the
visit
ralph
had
ceased
to
regret
that
her
daughter
was
out
he
felt
obscurely
that
in
the
girl
presence
frank
and
simple
as
he
thought
her
he
should
have
learned
less
of
life
in
early
apex
spragg
once
reconciled
or
at
least
resigned
to
the
mysterious
necessity
of
having
to
entertain
a
friend
of
undine
had
yielded
to
the
first
touch
on
the
weak
springs
of
her
garrulity
she
had
not
seen
heeny
for
two
days
and
this
friendly
young
man
with
the
gentle
manner
was
almost
as
easy
to
talk
to
as
the
masseuse
and
then
she
could
tell
him
things
that
heeny
already
knew
and
spragg
liked
to
repeat
her
stories
to
do
so
gave
her
almost
her
sole
sense
of
permanence
among
the
shifting
scenes
of
life
so
that
after
she
had
lengthily
deplored
the
untoward
accident
of
undine
absence
and
her
visitor
with
a
smile
and
echoes
of
divers
et
ondoyant
in
his
brain
had
repeated
her
daughter
name
after
her
saying
it
a
wonderful
find
how
could
you
tell
it
would
be
such
a
fit
it
came
to
her
quite
easily
to
answer
why
we
called
her
after
a
father
put
on
the
market
the
week
she
was
born
and
then
to
explain
as
he
remained
struck
and
silent
it
from
undoolay
you
know
the
french
for
crimping
father
always
thought
the
name
made
it
take
he
was
quite
a
scholar
and
had
the
greatest
knack
for
finding
names
i
remember
the
time
he
invented
his
goliath
glue
he
sat
up
all
night
over
the
bible
to
get
the
name
no
father
did
start
in
as
a
druggist
she
went
on
expanding
with
the
signs
of
marvell
interest
he
was
educated
for
an
undertaker
and
built
up
a
business
but
he
was
always
a
beautiful
speaker
and
after
a
while
he
sorter
drifted
into
the
ministry
of
course
it
did
pay
him
anything
like
as
well
so
finally
he
opened
a
and
he
did
at
that
too
though
his
heart
was
always
in
the
pulpit
but
after
he
made
such
a
success
with
his
he
got
speculating
in
land
out
at
apex
and
somehow
everything
went
though
spragg
did
all
he
could
spragg
when
she
found
herself
embarked
on
a
long
sentence
always
ballasted
it
by
italicizing
the
last
word
her
husband
she
continued
could
not
at
the
time
do
much
for
his
spragg
had
come
to
apex
as
a
poor
boy
and
their
early
married
life
had
been
a
protracted
struggle
darkened
by
domestic
affliction
two
of
their
three
children
had
died
of
typhoid
in
the
epidemic
which
devastated
apex
before
the
new
were
built
and
this
calamity
by
causing
spragg
to
resolve
that
thereafter
apex
should
drink
pure
water
had
led
directly
to
the
founding
of
his
fortunes
he
had
taken
over
some
of
poor
father
land
for
a
bad
debt
and
when
he
got
up
the
pure
water
move
the
company
voted
to
buy
the
land
and
build
the
new
reservoir
up
there
and
after
that
we
began
to
be
better
off
and
it
did
seem
as
if
it
had
come
out
so
to
comfort
us
some
about
the
children
spragg
thereafter
had
begun
to
be
a
power
in
apex
and
fat
years
had
followed
on
the
lean
ralph
marvell
was
too
little
versed
in
affairs
to
read
between
the
lines
of
spragg
untutored
narrative
and
he
understood
no
more
than
she
the
occult
connection
between
domestic
misfortunes
and
his
business
triumph
spragg
had
helped
out
his
ruined
and
had
vowed
on
his
children
graves
that
no
apex
child
should
ever
again
drink
poisoned
water
and
out
of
those
two
disinterested
impulses
by
some
impressive
law
of
compensation
material
prosperity
had
come
what
ralph
understood
and
appreciated
was
spragg
unaffected
frankness
in
talking
of
her
early
life
here
was
no
retrospective
pretense
of
an
opulent
past
such
as
the
other
invaders
were
given
to
parading
before
the
bland
but
undeceived
subject
race
the
spraggs
had
been
plain
people
and
had
not
yet
learned
to
be
ashamed
of
it
the
fact
drew
them
much
closer
to
the
dagonet
ideals
than
any
sham
elegance
in
the
past
tense
ralph
felt
that
his
mother
who
shuddered
away
from
harmon
driscoll
would
understand
and
esteem
spragg
but
how
long
would
their
virgin
innocence
last
popple
vulgar
hands
were
on
it
already
popple
and
the
unspeakable
van
degen
once
they
and
theirs
had
begun
the
process
of
initiating
undine
there
was
no
knowing
or
rather
there
was
too
easy
knowing
how
it
would
end
it
was
incredible
that
she
too
should
be
destined
to
swell
the
ranks
of
the
cheaply
fashionable
yet
were
not
her
very
freshness
her
malleability
the
mark
of
her
fate
she
was
still
at
the
age
when
the
flexible
soul
offers
itself
to
the
first
grasp
that
the
grasp
should
chance
to
be
van
degen
that
was
what
made
ralph
temples
buzz
and
swept
away
all
his
plans
for
his
own
future
like
a
beaver
dam
in
a
spring
flood
to
save
her
from
van
degen
and
van
degenism
was
that
really
to
be
his
mission
the
call
for
which
his
life
had
obscurely
waited
it
was
not
in
the
least
what
he
had
meant
to
do
with
the
fugitive
flash
of
consciousness
he
called
self
but
all
that
he
had
purposed
for
that
transitory
being
sank
into
insignificance
under
the
pressure
of
claims
ralph
marvell
notion
of
women
had
been
formed
on
the
experiences
common
to
young
men
of
his
kind
women
were
drawn
to
him
as
much
by
his
winning
appealing
quality
by
the
sense
of
a
youthful
warmth
behind
his
light
ironic
exterior
as
by
his
charms
of
face
and
mind
except
during
clare
dagonet
brief
reign
the
depths
in
him
had
not
been
stirred
but
in
taking
what
each
sentimental
episode
had
to
give
he
had
preserved
through
all
his
minor
adventures
his
faith
in
the
great
adventure
to
come
it
was
this
faith
that
made
him
so
easy
a
victim
when
love
had
at
last
appeared
clad
in
the
attributes
of
romance
the
imaginative
man
indestructible
dream
of
a
rounded
passion
the
clearness
with
which
he
judged
the
girl
and
himself
seemed
the
surest
proof
that
his
feeling
was
more
than
a
surface
thrill
he
was
not
blind
to
her
crudity
and
her
limitations
but
they
were
a
part
of
her
grace
and
her
persuasion
diverse
et
ondoyante
so
he
had
seen
her
from
the
first
but
was
not
that
merely
the
sign
of
a
quicker
response
to
the
world
manifold
appeal
there
was
harriet
ray
sealed
up
tight
in
the
vacuum
of
inherited
opinion
where
not
a
breath
of
fresh
sensation
could
get
at
her
there
could
be
no
call
to
rescue
young
ladies
so
secured
from
the
perils
of
reality
undine
had
no
such
traditional
safeguards
ralph
guessed
spragg
opinions
to
be
as
fluid
as
her
daughter
and
the
girl
very
sensitiveness
to
new
impressions
combined
with
her
obvious
lack
of
any
sense
of
relative
values
would
make
her
an
easy
prey
to
the
powers
of
folly
he
seemed
to
see
her
as
he
sat
there
pressing
his
fists
into
his
temples
he
seemed
to
see
her
like
a
lovely
andromeda
with
the
devouring
monster
society
careering
up
to
make
a
mouthful
of
her
and
himself
whirling
down
on
his
winged
horse
just
pegasus
turned
rosinante
for
the
nonce
to
cut
her
bonds
snatch
her
up
and
whirl
her
back
into
the
blue
vii
some
two
months
later
than
the
date
of
young
marvell
midnight
vigil
heeny
seated
on
a
low
chair
at
undine
knee
gave
the
girl
left
hand
an
approving
pat
as
she
laid
aside
her
lapful
of
polishers
there
i
guess
you
can
put
your
ring
on
again
she
said
with
a
laugh
of
jovial
significance
and
undine
echoing
the
laugh
in
a
murmur
of
complacency
slipped
on
the
fourth
finger
of
her
recovered
hand
a
band
of
sapphires
in
an
intricate
setting
heeny
took
up
the
hand
again
them
old
stones
undine
got
a
different
look
she
said
examining
the
ring
while
she
rubbed
her
cushioned
palm
over
the
girl
brilliant
and
the
quaint
i
would
wonder
but
what
it
was
one
of
old
dagonet
spragg
hovering
near
in
fond
beatitude
looked
up
quickly
why
do
you
he
bought
it
for
her
heeny
it
came
in
a
box
the
manicure
laughed
again
of
course
he
had
rub
it
up
ai
you
ever
heard
of
ancestral
jewels
spragg
in
the
aristocracy
they
never
go
out
and
buy
and
marrying
into
our
aristocracy
spragg
looked
relieved
oh
i
thought
maybe
they
were
trying
to
scrimp
on
the
ring
heeny
shrugging
away
this
explanation
rose
from
her
seat
and
rolled
back
her
shiny
black
sleeves
look
at
here
undine
if
you
really
want
me
to
do
your
hair
it
time
we
got
to
work
the
girl
swung
about
in
her
seat
so
that
she
faced
the
mirror
on
the
her
shoulders
shone
through
transparencies
of
lace
and
muslin
which
slipped
back
as
she
lifted
her
arms
to
draw
the
pins
from
her
hair
of
course
you
got
to
do
it
i
want
to
look
perfectly
lovely
well
i
dunno
my
hand
in
nowadays
said
heeny
in
a
tone
that
belied
the
doubt
she
cast
on
her
own
ability
oh
you
an
artist
heeny
and
i
just
could
have
had
that
french
maid
sighed
spragg
sinking
into
a
chair
near
the
undine
with
a
backward
toss
of
her
head
scattered
her
loose
locks
about
her
as
they
spread
and
sparkled
under
heeny
touch
spragg
leaned
back
drinking
in
through
lids
her
loveliness
some
new
quality
seemed
added
to
undine
beauty
it
had
a
milder
bloom
a
kind
of
melting
grace
which
might
have
been
lent
to
it
by
the
moisture
in
her
mother
eyes
so
you
to
see
the
old
gentleman
for
the
first
time
at
this
dinner
heeny
pursued
sweeping
the
live
strands
up
into
a
loosely
woven
crown
yes
i
frightened
to
death
undine
laughing
confidently
took
up
a
and
scrutinized
the
small
brown
mole
above
the
curve
of
her
upper
lip
i
guess
she
know
how
to
talk
to
him
spragg
averred
with
a
kind
of
quavering
triumph
she
know
how
to
look
at
him
anyhow
said
heeny
and
undine
smiled
at
her
own
image
i
hope
he
wo
think
i
too
awful
heeny
laughed
did
you
read
the
description
of
yourself
in
the
radiator
this
morning
i
i
had
time
to
cut
it
out
i
guess
i
have
to
start
a
separate
bag
for
your
clippings
soon
undine
stretched
her
arms
luxuriously
above
her
head
and
gazed
through
lowered
lids
at
the
foreshortened
reflection
of
her
face
mercy
do
jerk
about
like
that
am
i
to
put
in
this
rose
there
you
are
lovely
heeny
sighed
as
the
pink
petals
sank
into
the
hair
above
the
girl
forehead
undine
pushed
her
chair
back
and
sat
supporting
her
chin
on
her
clasped
hands
while
she
studied
the
result
of
heeny
manipulations
yes
that
the
way
peter
van
degen
flower
was
put
in
the
other
night
only
hers
was
a
do
you
think
i
look
better
with
a
camellia
i
guess
if
van
degen
looked
like
a
rose
she
worn
a
rose
heeny
rejoined
poetically
sit
still
a
minute
longer
she
added
your
hair
so
heavy
i
feel
easier
if
i
was
to
put
in
another
pin
undine
remained
motionless
and
the
manicure
suddenly
laying
both
hands
on
the
girl
shoulders
and
bending
over
to
peer
at
her
reflection
said
playfully
ever
been
engaged
before
undine
a
blush
rose
to
the
face
in
the
mirror
spreading
from
chin
to
brow
and
running
rosily
over
the
white
shoulders
from
which
their
covering
had
slipped
down
my
if
he
could
see
you
now
heeny
jested
spragg
rising
noiselessly
glided
across
the
room
and
became
lost
in
a
minute
examination
of
the
dress
laid
out
on
the
bed
with
a
supple
twist
undine
slipped
from
heeny
hold
engaged
mercy
yes
did
you
know
to
the
prince
of
wales
i
broke
it
off
because
i
would
live
in
the
tower
spragg
lifting
the
dress
cautiously
over
her
arm
advanced
with
a
reassured
smile
i
undie
go
to
europe
now
she
said
to
heeny
i
guess
undie
will
the
young
lady
herself
declared
we
going
to
sail
right
here
mother
do
be
careful
of
my
hair
she
ducked
gracefully
to
slip
into
the
lacy
fabric
which
her
mother
held
above
her
head
as
she
rose
above
its
folds
there
was
a
tap
on
the
door
immediately
followed
by
its
tentative
opening
mabel
undine
muttered
her
brows
lowering
like
her
father
and
spragg
wheeling
about
to
screen
her
daughter
addressed
herself
protestingly
to
the
door
who
there
oh
that
you
lipscomb
well
i
do
know
as
you
can
undie
is
half
dressed
yet
just
like
her
always
pushing
in
undine
murmured
as
she
slipped
her
arms
into
their
transparent
sleeves
oh
that
do
matter
i
help
dress
her
lipscomb
large
blond
person
surged
across
the
threshold
seems
to
me
i
ought
to
lend
a
hand
considering
i
was
the
one
that
introduced
them
undine
forced
a
smile
but
spragg
her
soft
wrinkles
deepening
with
resentment
muttered
to
heeny
as
she
bent
down
to
shake
out
the
girl
train
i
guess
my
daughter
only
got
to
show
herself
the
first
meeting
with
old
dagonet
was
less
formidable
than
undine
had
expected
she
had
been
once
before
to
the
house
in
washington
square
when
with
her
mother
she
had
returned
ceremonial
visit
but
on
that
occasion
ralph
grandfather
had
not
been
present
all
the
rites
connected
with
her
engagement
were
new
and
mysterious
to
undine
and
none
more
so
than
the
unaccountable
necessity
of
dragging
as
she
phrased
it
spragg
into
the
affair
it
was
an
accepted
article
of
the
apex
creed
that
parental
detachment
should
be
completest
at
the
moment
when
the
filial
fate
was
decided
and
to
find
that
new
york
reversed
this
rule
was
as
puzzling
to
undine
as
to
her
mother
spragg
was
so
unprepared
for
the
part
she
was
to
play
that
on
the
occasion
of
her
visit
to
marvell
her
helplessness
had
infected
undine
and
their
in
the
sober
faded
remained
among
the
girl
most
unsatisfactory
memories
she
it
alone
with
more
assurance
her
confidence
in
her
beauty
had
hitherto
carried
her
through
every
ordeal
and
it
was
fortified
now
by
the
feeling
of
power
that
came
with
the
sense
of
being
loved
if
they
would
only
leave
her
mother
out
she
was
sure
in
her
own
phrase
of
being
able
to
run
the
thing
and
spragg
had
providentially
been
left
out
of
the
dagonet
dinner
it
was
to
consist
it
appeared
only
of
the
small
family
group
undine
had
already
met
and
seated
at
old
dagonet
right
in
the
high
dark
with
mahogany
doors
and
dim
portraits
of
signers
and
their
females
she
felt
a
conscious
joy
in
her
ascendancy
old
dagonet
small
frail
and
softly
sardonic
appeared
to
fall
at
once
under
her
spell
if
she
felt
beneath
his
amenity
a
kind
of
delicate
dangerousness
like
that
of
some
fine
surgical
instrument
she
ignored
it
as
unimportant
for
she
had
as
yet
no
clear
perception
of
forces
that
did
not
directly
affect
her
marvell
faded
yet
impressive
was
less
responsive
to
her
arts
and
undine
divined
in
her
the
head
of
the
opposition
to
ralph
marriage
heeny
had
reported
that
marvell
had
other
views
for
her
son
and
this
was
confirmed
by
such
echoes
of
the
short
sharp
struggle
as
reached
the
throbbing
listeners
at
the
stentorian
but
the
conflict
over
the
air
had
immediately
cleared
showing
the
enemy
in
the
act
of
unconditional
surrender
it
surprised
undine
that
there
had
been
no
reprisals
no
return
on
the
points
conceded
that
was
not
her
idea
of
warfare
and
she
could
ascribe
the
completeness
of
the
victory
only
to
the
effect
of
her
charms
marvell
manner
did
not
express
entire
subjugation
yet
she
seemed
anxious
to
dispel
any
doubts
of
her
good
faith
and
if
she
left
the
burden
of
the
talk
to
her
lively
daughter
it
might
have
been
because
she
felt
more
capable
of
showing
indulgence
by
her
silence
than
in
her
speech
as
for
fairford
she
had
never
seemed
more
brilliantly
bent
on
fusing
the
various
elements
under
her
hand
undine
had
already
discovered
that
she
adored
her
brother
and
had
guessed
that
this
would
make
her
either
a
strong
ally
or
a
determined
enemy
the
latter
alternative
however
did
not
alarm
the
girl
she
thought
fairford
bright
and
wanted
to
be
liked
by
her
and
she
was
in
the
state
of
dizzy
when
it
seemed
easy
to
win
any
sympathy
she
chose
to
seek
for
the
only
other
guests
fairford
husband
and
the
elderly
charles
bowen
who
seemed
to
be
her
special
friend
undine
had
no
attention
to
spare
they
remained
on
a
plane
with
the
dim
pictures
hanging
at
her
back
she
had
expected
a
larger
party
but
she
was
relieved
on
the
whole
that
it
was
small
enough
to
permit
of
her
dominating
it
not
that
she
wished
to
do
so
by
any
loudness
of
assertion
her
quickness
in
noting
external
differences
had
already
taught
her
to
modulate
and
lower
her
voice
and
to
replace
the
and
i
would
wonder
by
more
polished
locutions
and
she
had
not
been
ten
minutes
at
table
before
she
found
that
to
seem
very
much
in
love
and
a
little
confused
and
subdued
by
the
newness
and
intensity
of
the
sentiment
was
to
the
dagonet
mind
the
becoming
attitude
for
a
young
lady
in
her
situation
the
part
was
not
hard
to
play
for
she
was
in
love
of
course
it
was
pleasant
when
she
looked
across
the
table
to
meet
ralph
grey
eyes
with
that
new
look
in
them
and
to
feel
that
she
had
kindled
it
but
i
it
was
only
part
of
her
larger
pleasure
in
the
general
homage
to
her
beauty
in
the
sensations
of
interest
and
curiosity
excited
by
everything
about
her
from
the
family
portraits
overhead
to
the
old
dagonet
silver
on
the
table
which
were
to
be
hers
too
after
all
the
talk
as
at
fairford
confused
her
by
its
lack
of
the
personal
allusion
its
tendency
to
turn
to
books
pictures
and
politics
politics
to
undine
had
always
been
like
a
kind
of
to
business
the
place
where
the
refuse
was
thrown
and
the
doubtful
messes
were
brewed
as
a
topic
and
one
to
provoke
disinterested
sentiments
it
had
the
hollowness
of
fourth
of
july
orations
and
her
mind
wandered
in
spite
of
the
desire
to
appear
informed
and
competent
old
dagonet
with
his
reedy
staccato
voice
that
gave
polish
and
relief
to
every
syllable
tried
to
come
to
her
aid
by
questioning
her
affably
about
her
family
and
the
friends
she
had
made
in
new
york
but
the
who
exists
simply
as
a
filial
prop
is
not
a
fruitful
theme
and
undine
called
on
for
the
first
time
to
view
her
own
progenitors
as
a
subject
of
conversation
was
struck
by
their
lack
of
points
she
had
never
paused
to
consider
what
her
father
and
mother
were
interested
in
and
challenged
to
specify
could
have
named
with
sincerity
only
herself
on
the
subject
of
her
new
york
friends
it
was
not
much
easier
to
enlarge
for
so
far
her
circle
had
grown
less
rapidly
than
she
expected
she
had
fancied
ralph
wooing
would
at
once
admit
her
to
all
his
social
privileges
but
he
had
shown
a
puzzling
reluctance
to
introduce
her
to
the
van
degen
set
where
he
came
and
went
with
such
familiarity
and
the
persons
he
seemed
anxious
to
have
her
know
a
few
frumpy
clever
women
of
his
sister
age
and
one
or
two
brisk
old
ladies
in
shabby
houses
with
mahogany
furniture
and
stuart
portraits
did
not
offer
the
opportunities
she
sought
oh
i
do
know
many
people
yet
i
tell
ralph
he
got
to
hurry
up
and
take
me
round
she
said
to
dagonet
with
a
for
ralph
whose
gaze
between
the
flowers
and
lights
she
was
aware
of
perpetually
drawing
my
daughter
will
take
you
you
must
know
his
mother
friends
the
old
gentleman
rejoined
while
marvell
smiled
noncommittally
but
you
have
a
great
friend
of
your
own
the
lady
who
takes
you
into
society
dagonet
pursued
and
undine
had
the
sense
that
the
irrepressible
mabel
was
again
pushing
in
oh
yes
mabel
lipscomb
we
were
she
said
indifferently
lipscomb
lipscomb
what
is
lipscomb
occupation
he
a
broker
said
undine
glad
to
be
able
to
place
her
husband
in
so
handsome
a
light
the
subtleties
of
a
professional
classification
unknown
to
apex
had
already
taught
her
that
in
new
york
it
is
more
distinguished
to
be
a
broker
than
a
dentist
and
she
was
surprised
at
dagonet
lack
of
enthusiasm
ah
a
broker
he
said
it
almost
as
popple
might
have
said
a
dentist
and
undine
found
herself
astray
in
a
new
labyrinth
of
social
distinctions
she
felt
a
sudden
contempt
for
harry
lipscomb
who
had
already
struck
her
as
too
loud
and
irrelevantly
comic
i
guess
mabel
get
a
divorce
pretty
soon
she
added
desiring
for
personal
reasons
to
present
lipscomb
as
favourably
as
possible
dagonet
handsome
drew
together
a
divorce
h
bad
has
he
been
misbehaving
himself
undine
looked
innocently
surprised
oh
i
guess
not
they
like
each
other
well
enough
but
he
been
a
disappointment
to
her
he
in
the
right
set
and
i
think
mabel
realizes
she
never
really
get
anywhere
till
she
gets
rid
of
him
these
words
uttered
in
the
high
fluting
tone
that
she
rose
to
when
sure
of
her
subject
fell
on
a
pause
which
prolonged
and
deepened
itself
to
receive
them
while
every
face
at
the
table
ralph
marvell
excepted
reflected
in
varying
degree
dagonet
pained
astonishment
but
my
dear
young
lady
what
would
your
friend
situation
be
if
as
you
put
it
she
rid
of
her
husband
on
so
trivial
a
pretext
undine
surprised
at
his
dullness
tried
to
explain
oh
that
be
the
reason
given
of
course
any
lawyer
could
fix
it
up
for
them
do
they
generally
call
it
desertion
there
was
another
more
palpitating
silence
broken
by
a
laugh
from
ralph
ralph
his
mother
breathed
then
turning
to
undine
she
said
with
a
constrained
smile
i
believe
in
certain
parts
of
the
country
such
unfortunate
arrangements
are
beginning
to
be
tolerated
but
in
new
york
in
spite
of
our
growing
indifference
a
divorced
woman
is
still
thank
heaven
at
a
decided
disadvantage
undine
eyes
opened
wide
here
at
last
was
a
topic
that
really
interested
her
and
one
that
gave
another
amazing
glimpse
into
the
camera
obscura
of
new
york
society
do
you
mean
to
say
mabel
would
be
worse
off
then
could
she
even
go
round
as
much
as
she
does
now
marvell
met
this
gravely
it
would
depend
i
should
say
on
the
kind
of
people
she
wished
to
see
oh
the
very
best
of
course
that
would
be
her
only
object
ralph
interposed
with
another
laugh
you
see
undine
you
better
think
twice
before
you
divorce
me
ralph
his
mother
again
breathed
but
the
girl
flushed
and
sparkling
flung
back
oh
it
all
depends
on
you
out
in
apex
if
a
girl
marries
a
man
who
do
come
up
to
what
she
expected
people
consider
it
to
her
credit
to
want
to
change
you
better
think
twice
of
that
if
i
were
only
sure
of
knowing
what
you
expect
he
caught
up
her
joke
tossing
it
back
at
her
across
the
fascinated
silence
of
their
listeners
why
everything
she
announced
and
dagonet
turning
laid
an
old
hand
on
hers
and
said
with
a
change
of
tone
that
relaxed
the
tension
of
the
listeners
my
child
if
you
look
like
that
you
get
it
viii
it
was
doubtless
owing
to
fairford
foresight
that
such
possibilities
of
tension
were
curtailed
after
dinner
by
her
carrying
off
ralph
and
his
betrothed
to
the
theatre
dagonet
it
was
understood
always
went
to
bed
after
an
hour
whist
with
his
daughter
and
the
silent
fairford
gave
his
evenings
to
bridge
at
his
club
the
party
therefore
consisted
only
of
undine
and
ralph
with
fairford
and
her
attendant
friend
undine
vaguely
wondered
why
the
grave
and
bowen
formed
so
invariable
a
part
of
that
lady
train
but
she
concluded
that
it
was
the
york
custom
for
married
ladies
to
have
gentlemen
as
girls
had
in
apex
and
that
bowen
was
the
sole
survivor
of
laura
fairford
earlier
triumphs
she
had
however
little
time
to
give
to
such
conjectures
for
the
performance
they
were
attending
the
debut
of
a
fashionable
london
actress
had
attracted
a
large
audience
in
which
undine
immediately
recognized
a
number
of
familiar
faces
her
engagement
had
been
announced
only
the
day
before
and
she
had
the
delicious
sense
of
being
in
all
the
papers
and
of
focussing
countless
glances
of
interest
and
curiosity
as
she
swept
through
the
theatre
in
fairford
wake
their
stalls
were
near
the
stage
and
progress
thither
was
slow
enough
to
permit
of
prolonged
enjoyment
of
this
sensation
before
passing
to
her
place
she
paused
for
ralph
to
remove
her
cloak
and
as
he
lifted
it
from
her
shoulders
she
heard
a
lady
say
behind
her
there
she
is
the
one
in
white
with
the
lovely
back
and
a
man
answer
gad
where
did
he
find
anything
as
good
as
that
anonymous
approval
was
sweet
enough
but
she
was
to
taste
a
moment
more
exquisite
when
in
the
proscenium
box
across
the
house
she
saw
clare
van
degen
seated
beside
the
prim
figure
of
miss
harriet
ray
here
to
see
me
with
him
they
hate
it
but
they
could
keep
away
she
turned
and
lifted
a
smile
of
possessorship
to
ralph
fairford
seemed
also
struck
by
the
presence
of
the
two
ladies
and
undine
heard
her
whisper
to
bowen
do
you
see
clare
over
there
and
harriet
with
her
harriet
would
come
i
call
it
spartan
and
so
like
clare
to
ask
her
her
companion
laughed
it
one
of
the
deepest
instincts
in
human
nature
the
murdered
are
as
much
given
as
the
murderer
to
haunting
the
scene
of
the
crime
doubtless
guessing
ralph
desire
to
have
undine
to
himself
fairford
had
sent
the
girl
in
first
and
undine
as
she
seated
herself
was
aware
that
the
occupant
of
the
next
stall
half
turned
to
her
as
with
a
vague
gesture
of
recognition
but
just
then
the
curtain
rose
and
she
became
absorbed
in
the
development
of
the
drama
especially
as
it
tended
to
display
the
remarkable
toilets
which
succeeded
each
other
on
the
person
of
its
leading
lady
undine
seated
at
ralph
marvell
side
and
feeling
the
thrill
of
his
proximity
as
a
subtler
element
in
the
general
interest
she
was
exciting
was
at
last
repaid
for
the
disappointment
of
her
evening
at
the
opera
it
was
characteristic
of
her
that
she
remembered
her
failures
as
keenly
as
her
triumphs
and
that
the
passionate
desire
to
obliterate
to
get
even
with
them
was
always
among
the
latent
incentives
of
her
conduct
now
at
last
she
was
having
what
she
wanted
she
was
in
conscious
possession
of
the
real
thing
and
through
her
other
diffused
sensations
ralph
adoration
gave
her
such
a
last
refinement
of
pleasure
as
might
have
come
to
some
warrior
queen
borne
in
triumph
by
captive
princes
and
reading
in
the
eyes
of
one
the
passion
he
dared
not
speak
when
the
curtain
fell
this
vague
enjoyment
was
heightened
by
various
acts
of
recognition
all
the
people
she
wanted
to
go
with
as
they
said
in
apex
seemed
to
be
about
her
in
the
stalls
and
boxes
and
her
eyes
continued
to
revert
with
special
satisfaction
to
the
incongruous
group
formed
by
peter
van
degen
and
miss
ray
the
sight
made
it
irresistible
to
whisper
to
ralph
you
ought
to
go
round
and
talk
to
your
cousin
have
you
told
her
we
engaged
clare
of
course
she
going
to
call
on
you
tomorrow
oh
she
need
put
herself
out
she
never
been
yet
said
undine
loftily
he
made
no
rejoinder
but
presently
asked
who
that
you
waving
to
popple
he
coming
round
to
see
us
you
know
he
wants
to
paint
me
undine
fluttered
and
beamed
as
the
brilliant
popple
made
his
way
across
the
stalls
to
the
seat
which
her
neighbour
had
momentarily
left
chap
next
to
you
whoever
he
is
to
give
me
this
chance
the
artist
declared
ha
ralph
my
boy
how
did
you
pull
it
off
what
we
all
of
us
wondering
he
leaned
over
to
give
marvell
hand
the
ironic
grasp
of
celibacy
well
you
left
us
lamenting
he
has
you
know
miss
spragg
but
i
got
one
pull
over
the
others
i
can
paint
you
he
ca
forbid
that
can
he
not
before
marriage
anyhow
undine
divided
her
shining
glances
between
the
two
i
guess
he
going
to
treat
me
any
different
afterward
she
proclaimed
with
joyous
defiance
ah
well
there
no
telling
you
know
had
we
better
begin
at
once
seriously
i
want
awfully
to
get
you
into
the
spring
show
oh
really
that
would
be
too
lovely
you
would
be
certainly
the
way
i
mean
to
do
you
but
i
see
ralph
getting
glum
cheer
up
my
dear
fellow
i
daresay
you
be
invited
to
some
of
the
sittings
that
for
miss
spragg
to
ah
here
comes
your
neighbour
back
confound
him
you
let
me
know
when
we
can
begin
as
popple
moved
away
undine
turned
eagerly
to
marvell
do
you
suppose
there
time
i
love
to
have
him
to
do
me
ralph
smiled
my
poor
child
he
would
you
with
a
vengeance
infernal
cheek
his
asking
you
to
sit
she
stared
but
why
he
painted
your
cousin
and
all
the
smart
women
oh
if
a
portrait
all
you
want
i
want
what
the
others
want
she
answered
frowning
and
pouting
a
little
she
was
already
beginning
to
resent
in
ralph
the
slightest
sign
of
resistance
to
her
pleasure
and
her
resentment
took
the
form
a
familiar
one
in
apex
courtships
of
turning
on
him
in
the
next
a
deliberately
averted
shoulder
the
result
of
this
was
to
bring
her
for
the
first
time
in
more
direct
relation
to
her
other
neighbour
as
she
turned
he
turned
too
showing
her
above
a
shining
fastened
with
a
large
imitation
pearl
a
ruddy
plump
snub
face
without
an
angle
in
it
which
yet
looked
sharper
than
a
razor
undine
eyes
met
his
with
a
startled
look
and
for
a
long
moment
they
remained
suspended
on
each
other
stare
undine
at
length
shrank
back
with
an
unrecognizing
face
but
her
movement
made
her
slip
to
the
floor
and
her
neighbour
bent
down
and
picked
it
up
well
do
you
know
me
yet
he
said
with
a
slight
smile
as
he
restored
the
glass
to
her
she
had
grown
white
to
the
lips
and
when
she
tried
to
speak
the
effort
produced
only
a
faint
click
in
her
throat
she
felt
that
the
change
in
her
appearance
must
be
visible
and
the
dread
of
letting
marvell
see
it
made
her
continue
to
turn
her
ravaged
face
to
her
other
neighbour
the
round
black
eyes
set
prominently
in
the
latter
round
glossy
countenance
had
expressed
at
first
only
an
impersonal
and
slightly
ironic
interest
but
a
look
of
surprise
grew
in
them
as
undine
silence
continued
what
the
matter
do
you
want
me
to
speak
to
you
she
became
aware
that
marvell
as
if
unconscious
of
her
slight
show
of
displeasure
had
left
his
seat
and
was
making
his
way
toward
the
aisle
and
this
assertion
of
independence
which
a
moment
before
she
would
so
deeply
have
resented
now
gave
her
a
feeling
of
intense
relief
no
do
speak
to
me
please
i
tell
you
another
time
write
her
neighbour
continued
to
gaze
at
her
forming
his
lips
into
a
noiseless
whistle
under
his
small
dark
moustache
well
i
that
about
the
stiffest
he
murmured
and
as
she
made
no
answer
he
added
afraid
i
ask
to
be
introduced
to
your
friend
she
made
a
faint
movement
of
entreaty
i
ca
explain
i
promise
to
see
you
but
i
ask
you
not
to
talk
to
me
now
he
unfolded
his
programme
and
went
on
speaking
in
a
low
tone
while
he
affected
to
study
it
anything
to
oblige
of
course
that
always
been
my
motto
but
is
it
a
bargain
fair
and
square
you
see
me
she
receded
farther
from
him
i
promise
i
i
want
to
she
faltered
all
right
then
call
me
up
in
the
morning
at
the
driscoll
building
got
it
she
nodded
and
he
added
in
a
still
lower
tone
i
suppose
i
can
congratulate
you
anyhow
and
then
without
waiting
for
her
reply
turned
to
study
van
degen
box
through
his
clare
as
if
aware
of
the
scrutiny
fixed
on
her
from
below
leaned
back
and
threw
a
question
over
her
shoulder
to
ralph
marvell
who
had
just
seated
himself
behind
her
who
the
funny
man
with
the
red
face
talking
to
miss
spragg
ralph
bent
forward
the
man
next
to
her
never
saw
him
before
but
i
think
you
mistaken
she
not
speaking
to
him
she
was
was
she
harriet
miss
ray
pinched
her
lips
together
without
speaking
and
van
degen
paused
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
perhaps
he
an
apex
friend
she
then
suggested
very
likely
only
i
think
she
have
introduced
him
if
he
had
been
his
cousin
faintly
shrugged
shall
you
encourage
that
peter
van
degen
who
had
strayed
into
his
wife
box
for
a
moment
caught
the
colloquy
and
lifted
his
the
fellow
next
to
miss
spragg
by
george
ralph
she
ripping
wait
a
minute
i
know
his
face
saw
him
in
old
harmon
driscoll
office
the
day
of
the
eubaw
mine
meeting
this
chap
his
secretary
or
something
driscoll
called
him
in
to
give
some
facts
to
the
directors
and
he
seemed
a
mighty
customer
clare
van
degen
turned
gaily
to
her
cousin
if
he
has
anything
to
do
with
the
driscolls
you
better
cultivate
him
that
the
kind
of
acquaintance
the
dagonets
have
always
needed
i
married
to
set
them
an
example
ralph
rose
with
a
laugh
you
right
i
hurry
back
and
make
his
acquaintance
he
held
out
his
hand
to
his
cousin
avoiding
her
disappointed
eyes
undine
on
entering
her
bedroom
late
that
evening
was
startled
by
the
presence
of
a
muffled
figure
which
revealed
itself
through
the
dimness
as
the
ungirded
midnight
outline
of
spragg
mother
what
on
earth
the
girl
exclaimed
as
spragg
pressed
the
electric
button
and
flooded
the
room
with
light
the
idea
of
a
mother
sitting
up
for
her
daughter
was
so
foreign
to
apex
customs
that
it
roused
only
mistrust
and
irritation
in
the
object
of
the
demonstration
spragg
came
forward
deprecatingly
to
lift
the
cloak
from
her
daughter
shoulders
i
just
had
to
undie
i
told
father
i
had
to
i
wanted
to
hear
all
about
it
undine
shrugged
away
from
her
mercy
at
this
hour
you
be
as
white
as
a
sheet
sitting
up
all
night
like
this
she
moved
toward
the
and
began
to
demolish
with
feverish
hands
the
structure
which
heeny
a
few
hours
earlier
had
so
lovingly
raised
but
the
rose
caught
in
a
mesh
of
hair
and
spragg
venturing
timidly
to
release
it
had
a
full
view
of
her
daughter
face
in
the
glass
why
undie
you
as
white
as
a
sheet
now
you
look
fairly
sick
what
the
matter
daughter
the
girl
broke
away
from
her
oh
ca
you
leave
me
alone
mother
there
do
i
look
white
now
she
cried
the
blood
flaming
into
her
pale
cheeks
and
as
spragg
shrank
back
she
added
more
mildly
in
the
tone
of
a
parent
rebuking
a
persistent
child
it
enough
to
make
anybody
sick
to
be
stared
at
that
way
spragg
overflowed
with
compunction
i
so
sorry
undie
i
guess
it
was
just
seeing
you
in
this
glare
of
light
yes
the
light
awful
do
turn
some
off
ordered
undine
for
whom
ordinarily
no
radiance
was
too
strong
and
spragg
grateful
to
have
commands
laid
upon
her
hastened
to
obey
undine
after
this
submitted
in
brooding
silence
to
having
her
dress
unlaced
and
her
slippers
and
brought
to
her
spragg
visibly
yearned
to
say
more
but
she
restrained
the
impulse
lest
it
should
provoke
her
dismissal
wo
you
take
just
a
sup
of
milk
before
you
go
to
bed
she
suggested
at
length
as
undine
sank
into
an
armchair
i
got
some
for
you
right
here
in
the
parlour
without
looking
up
the
girl
answered
no
i
do
want
anything
do
go
to
bed
her
mother
seemed
to
be
struggling
between
the
instinct
of
obedience
and
a
swift
unformulated
fear
i
going
undie
she
wavered
did
they
receive
you
right
daughter
she
asked
with
sudden
resolution
what
nonsense
how
should
they
receive
me
everybody
was
lovely
to
me
undine
rose
to
her
feet
and
went
on
with
her
undressing
tossing
her
clothes
on
the
floor
and
shaking
her
hair
over
her
bare
shoulders
spragg
stooped
to
gather
up
the
scattered
garments
as
they
fell
folding
them
with
a
wistful
caressing
touch
and
laying
them
on
the
lounge
without
daring
to
raise
her
eyes
to
her
daughter
it
was
not
till
she
heard
undine
throw
herself
on
the
bed
that
she
went
toward
her
and
drew
the
coverlet
up
with
deprecating
hands
oh
do
put
the
light
out
i
dead
tired
the
girl
grumbled
pressing
her
face
into
the
pillow
spragg
turned
away
obediently
then
gathering
all
her
scattered
impulses
into
a
passionate
act
of
courage
she
moved
back
to
the
bedside
undie
you
did
see
anybody
i
mean
at
the
theatre
anybody
you
did
want
to
see
undine
at
the
question
raised
her
head
and
started
right
against
the
tossed
pillows
her
white
exasperated
face
close
to
her
twitching
features
the
two
women
examined
each
other
a
moment
fear
and
anger
in
their
crossed
glances
then
undine
answered
no
nobody
ix
undine
late
the
next
day
waited
alone
under
the
leafless
trellising
of
a
wistaria
arbour
on
the
west
side
of
the
central
park
she
had
put
on
her
plainest
dress
and
wound
a
closely
patterned
veil
over
her
least
vivid
hat
but
even
thus
toned
down
to
the
situation
she
was
conscious
of
blazing
out
from
it
inconveniently
the
habit
of
meeting
young
men
in
sequestered
spots
was
not
unknown
to
her
the
novelty
was
in
feeling
any
embarrassment
about
it
even
now
she
was
disturbed
not
so
much
by
the
unlikely
chance
of
an
accidental
encounter
with
ralph
marvell
as
by
the
remembrance
of
similar
meetings
far
from
accidental
with
the
romantic
aaronson
could
it
be
that
the
hand
now
adorned
with
ralph
engagement
ring
had
once
in
this
very
spot
surrendered
itself
to
the
pressure
at
the
thought
a
wave
of
physical
disgust
passed
over
her
blotting
out
another
memory
as
distasteful
but
more
remote
it
was
revived
by
the
appearance
of
a
ruddy
young
man
his
stoutish
figure
tightly
buttoned
into
a
who
presently
approached
along
the
path
that
led
to
the
arbour
silhouetted
against
the
slope
of
the
asphalt
the
newcomer
revealed
an
outline
thick
yet
compact
with
a
round
head
set
on
a
neck
in
which
at
the
first
chance
prosperity
would
be
likely
to
develop
a
red
crease
his
face
with
its
rounded
surfaces
and
the
sanguine
innocence
of
a
complexion
belied
by
prematurely
astute
black
eyes
had
a
look
of
jovial
cunning
which
undine
had
formerly
thought
smart
but
which
now
struck
her
as
merely
vulgar
she
felt
that
in
the
marvell
set
elmer
moffatt
would
have
been
stamped
as
not
a
gentleman
nevertheless
something
in
his
look
seemed
to
promise
the
capacity
to
develop
into
any
character
he
might
care
to
assume
though
it
did
not
seem
probable
that
for
the
present
that
of
a
gentleman
would
be
among
them
he
had
always
had
a
brisk
swaggering
step
and
the
faintly
impudent
tilt
of
the
head
that
she
had
once
thought
dashing
but
whereas
this
look
had
formerly
denoted
a
somewhat
desperate
defiance
of
the
world
and
its
judgments
it
now
suggested
an
almost
assured
relation
to
these
powers
and
undine
heart
sank
at
the
thought
of
what
the
change
implied
as
he
drew
nearer
the
young
man
air
of
assurance
was
replaced
by
an
expression
of
mildly
humorous
surprise
well
this
is
white
of
you
undine
he
said
taking
her
lifeless
fingers
into
his
dapperly
gloved
hand
through
her
veil
she
formed
the
words
i
said
i
come
he
laughed
that
so
and
you
see
i
believed
you
though
i
might
not
have
i
do
see
the
use
of
beginning
like
this
she
interrupted
nervously
that
so
too
suppose
we
walk
along
a
little
ways
it
rather
chilly
standing
round
he
turned
down
the
path
that
descended
toward
the
ramble
and
the
girl
moved
on
beside
him
with
her
long
flowing
steps
when
they
had
reached
the
comparative
shelter
of
the
interlacing
trees
moffatt
paused
again
to
say
if
we
going
to
talk
i
like
to
see
you
undine
and
after
a
first
moment
of
reluctance
she
submissively
threw
back
her
veil
he
let
his
eyes
rest
on
her
in
silence
then
he
said
judicially
filled
out
some
but
you
paler
after
another
appreciative
scrutiny
he
added
there
mighty
few
women
as
well
worth
looking
at
and
obliged
to
you
for
letting
me
have
the
chance
again
undine
brows
drew
together
but
she
softened
her
frown
to
a
quivering
smile
i
glad
to
see
you
too
elmer
i
am
really
he
returned
her
smile
while
his
glance
continued
to
study
her
humorously
you
did
betray
the
fact
last
night
miss
spragg
i
was
so
taken
aback
i
thought
you
were
out
in
alaska
somewhere
the
young
man
shaped
his
lips
into
the
mute
whistle
by
which
he
habitually
vented
his
surprise
you
did
did
abner
spragg
tell
you
he
seen
me
down
town
undine
gave
him
a
startled
glance
father
why
have
you
seen
him
he
never
said
a
word
about
it
her
companion
whistle
became
audible
he
running
yet
he
said
gaily
i
wish
i
could
scare
some
people
as
easy
as
i
can
your
father
the
girl
hesitated
i
never
felt
toward
you
the
way
father
did
she
hazarded
at
length
and
he
gave
her
another
long
look
in
return
well
if
they
left
you
alone
i
do
believe
you
ever
have
acted
mean
to
me
was
the
conclusion
he
drew
from
it
i
did
mean
to
elmer
i
give
you
my
word
but
i
was
so
young
i
did
know
anything
his
eyes
had
a
twinkle
of
reminiscent
pleasantry
no
i
do
suppose
it
would
teach
a
girl
much
to
be
engaged
two
years
to
a
stiff
like
millard
binch
and
that
was
about
all
that
had
happened
to
you
before
i
came
along
undine
flushed
to
the
forehead
oh
elmer
i
was
only
a
child
when
i
was
engaged
to
millard
that
a
fact
and
you
went
on
being
one
a
good
while
afterward
the
apex
eagle
always
you
i
ca
see
what
the
use
now
that
ruled
out
of
court
too
see
here
undine
what
can
we
talk
about
i
understood
that
was
what
we
were
here
for
of
course
she
made
an
effort
at
recovery
i
only
meant
to
say
what
the
use
of
raking
up
things
that
are
over
rake
up
that
the
idea
is
it
was
that
why
you
tried
to
cut
me
last
night
i
oh
elmer
i
did
mean
to
only
you
see
i
engaged
oh
i
saw
that
fast
enough
i
have
seen
it
even
if
i
did
read
the
papers
he
gave
a
short
laugh
he
was
feeling
pretty
good
sitting
there
alongside
of
you
was
he
i
do
wonder
he
was
i
remember
but
i
do
see
that
that
was
a
reason
for
me
a
respectable
member
of
society
now
i
one
of
harmon
private
secretaries
he
brought
out
the
fact
with
mock
solemnity
but
to
undine
though
undoubtedly
impressive
the
statement
did
not
immediately
present
itself
as
a
subject
for
pleasantry
elmer
moffatt
you
are
he
laughed
again
guess
you
have
remembered
me
last
night
if
known
it
she
was
following
her
own
train
of
thought
with
a
look
of
pale
intensity
you
living
in
new
york
then
you
going
to
live
here
right
along
well
it
looks
that
way
as
long
as
i
can
hang
on
to
this
job
great
men
always
gravitate
to
the
metropolis
and
i
gravitated
here
just
as
uncle
harmon
was
looking
round
for
somebody
who
could
give
him
an
inside
tip
on
the
eubaw
mine
deal
you
know
the
driscolls
are
pretty
deep
in
eubaw
i
happened
to
go
out
there
after
our
little
unpleasantness
at
apex
and
it
was
just
the
time
the
deal
went
through
so
in
one
way
your
folks
did
me
a
good
turn
when
they
made
apex
too
hot
for
me
funny
to
think
of
ai
it
undine
recovering
herself
held
out
her
hand
impulsively
i
real
glad
of
it
i
mean
i
real
glad
you
had
such
a
stroke
of
luck
much
obliged
he
returned
by
the
way
you
might
mention
the
fact
to
abner
spragg
next
time
you
run
across
him
father
be
real
glad
too
elmer
she
hesitated
and
then
went
on
you
must
see
now
that
it
was
natural
father
and
mother
should
have
felt
the
way
they
did
oh
the
only
thing
that
struck
me
as
unnatural
was
their
making
you
feel
so
too
but
i
free
to
admit
i
was
a
promising
case
in
those
days
his
glance
played
over
her
for
a
moment
say
undine
it
was
good
while
it
lasted
though
was
it
she
shrank
back
with
a
burning
face
and
eyes
of
misery
why
what
the
matter
that
ruled
out
too
oh
all
right
look
at
here
undine
suppose
you
let
me
know
what
you
are
here
to
talk
about
anyhow
she
cast
a
helpless
glance
down
the
windings
of
the
wooded
glen
in
which
they
had
halted
just
to
ask
you
to
beg
you
not
to
say
anything
of
this
kind
again
ever
anything
about
you
and
me
she
nodded
mutely
why
what
wrong
anybody
been
saying
anything
against
me
oh
no
it
not
that
what
on
earth
is
it
then
except
that
you
ashamed
of
me
one
way
or
another
she
made
no
answer
and
he
stood
digging
the
tip
of
his
into
a
fissure
of
the
asphalt
at
length
he
went
on
in
a
tone
that
showed
a
first
faint
trace
of
irritation
i
do
want
to
break
into
your
crowd
if
it
that
you
scared
of
his
tone
seemed
to
increase
her
distress
no
no
you
do
understand
all
i
want
is
that
nothing
shall
be
known
yes
but
why
it
was
all
straight
enough
if
you
come
to
that
it
does
matter
whether
it
was
straight
or
not
he
interpolated
a
whistle
which
made
her
add
what
i
mean
is
that
out
here
in
the
east
they
do
even
like
it
if
a
girl
been
engaged
before
this
last
strain
on
his
credulity
wrung
a
laugh
from
moffatt
gee
how
they
expect
her
fair
young
life
to
pass
playing
city
on
the
melodeon
and
knitting
tidies
for
church
fairs
girls
are
looked
after
here
it
all
different
their
mothers
go
round
with
them
this
increased
her
companion
hilarity
and
he
glanced
about
him
with
a
pretense
of
compunction
excuse
me
i
ought
to
have
remembered
your
chaperon
miss
spragg
he
crooked
his
arm
with
mock
ceremony
allow
me
to
escort
you
to
the
you
see
i
onto
the
new
york
style
myself
a
sigh
of
discouragement
escaped
her
elmer
if
you
really
believe
i
never
wanted
to
act
mean
to
you
do
you
act
mean
to
me
now
act
mean
he
grew
serious
again
and
moved
nearer
to
her
what
is
it
you
want
undine
why
ca
you
say
it
right
out
what
i
told
you
i
do
want
ralph
marvell
or
any
of
them
to
know
anything
if
any
of
his
folks
found
out
they
never
let
him
marry
me
never
and
he
would
want
to
he
be
so
horrified
and
it
would
kill
me
elmer
it
would
just
kill
me
she
pressed
close
to
him
forgetful
of
her
new
reserves
and
repugnances
and
impelled
by
the
passionate
absorbing
desire
to
wring
from
him
some
definite
pledge
of
safety
oh
elmer
if
you
ever
liked
me
help
me
now
and
i
help
you
if
i
get
the
chance
he
had
recovered
his
coolness
as
hers
forsook
her
and
stood
his
ground
steadily
though
her
entreating
hands
her
glowing
face
were
near
enough
to
have
shaken
less
sturdy
nerves
that
so
puss
you
just
ask
me
to
pass
the
sponge
over
elmer
moffatt
of
apex
city
cut
the
gentleman
when
we
meet
that
the
size
of
it
oh
elmer
it
my
first
chance
i
ca
lose
it
she
broke
out
sobbing
nonsense
child
of
course
you
sha
here
look
up
undine
why
i
never
saw
you
cry
before
do
you
be
afraid
of
me
ai
going
to
interrupt
the
wedding
march
he
began
to
whistle
a
bar
of
lohengrin
i
only
just
want
one
little
promise
in
return
she
threw
a
startled
look
at
him
and
he
added
reassuringly
oh
mistake
me
i
do
want
to
butt
into
your
set
not
for
social
purposes
anyhow
but
if
ever
it
should
come
handy
to
know
any
of
in
a
business
way
would
you
fix
it
up
for
me
after
you
married
their
eyes
met
and
she
remained
silent
for
a
tremulous
moment
or
two
then
she
held
out
her
hand
afterward
yes
i
promise
and
you
promise
elmer
oh
to
have
and
to
hold
he
sang
out
swinging
about
to
follow
her
as
she
hurriedly
began
to
retrace
her
steps
the
march
twilight
had
fallen
and
the
stentorian
facade
was
all
aglow
when
undine
regained
its
monumental
threshold
she
slipped
through
the
marble
vestibule
and
soared
skyward
in
the
lift
hardly
conscious
of
the
direction
she
was
taking
what
she
wanted
was
solitude
and
the
time
to
put
some
order
into
her
thoughts
and
she
hoped
to
steal
into
her
room
without
meeting
her
mother
through
her
thick
veil
the
clusters
of
lights
in
the
spragg
dilated
and
flowed
together
in
a
yellow
blur
from
which
as
she
entered
a
figure
detached
itself
and
with
a
start
of
annoyance
she
saw
ralph
marvell
rise
from
the
perusal
of
the
fiction
number
of
a
magazine
which
had
replaced
the
hound
of
the
baskervilles
on
the
onyx
table
yes
you
told
me
not
to
come
and
here
i
am
he
lifted
her
hand
to
his
lips
as
his
eyes
tried
to
find
hers
through
the
veil
she
drew
back
with
a
nervous
gesture
i
told
you
i
be
awfully
late
i
know
trying
on
and
you
horribly
tired
and
wishing
with
all
your
might
i
was
here
i
not
so
sure
i
not
she
rejoined
trying
to
hide
her
vexation
in
a
smile
what
a
tragic
little
voice
you
really
are
done
up
i
could
help
dropping
in
for
a
minute
but
of
course
if
you
say
so
i
be
off
she
was
removing
her
long
gloves
and
he
took
her
hands
and
drew
her
close
only
take
off
your
veil
and
let
me
see
you
a
quiver
of
resistance
ran
through
her
he
felt
it
and
dropped
her
hands
please
do
tease
i
never
could
bear
it
she
stammered
drawing
away
till
then
that
is
if
the
permit
she
forced
a
laugh
if
i
showed
myself
now
you
might
not
come
back
i
look
perfectly
hideous
it
was
so
hot
and
they
kept
me
so
long
all
to
make
yourself
more
beautiful
for
a
man
who
blind
with
your
beauty
already
the
words
made
her
smile
and
moving
nearer
she
bent
her
head
and
stood
still
while
he
undid
her
veil
as
he
put
it
back
their
lips
met
and
his
look
of
passionate
tenderness
was
incense
to
her
but
the
next
moment
his
expression
passed
from
worship
to
concern
dear
why
what
the
matter
you
been
crying
she
put
both
hands
to
her
hat
in
the
instinctive
effort
to
hide
her
face
his
persistence
was
as
irritating
as
her
mother
i
told
you
it
was
frightfully
hot
and
all
my
things
were
horrid
and
it
made
me
so
cross
and
nervous
she
turned
to
the
with
a
feint
of
smoothing
her
hair
marvell
laid
his
hand
on
her
arm
i
ca
bear
to
see
you
so
done
up
why
ca
we
be
married
and
escape
all
these
ridiculous
preparations
i
shall
hate
your
fine
clothes
if
they
going
to
make
you
so
miserable
she
dropped
her
hands
and
swept
about
on
him
her
face
lit
up
by
a
new
idea
he
was
extraordinarily
handsome
and
appealing
and
her
heart
began
to
beat
faster
i
hate
it
all
too
i
wish
we
could
be
married
right
away
marvell
caught
her
to
him
joyously
dearest
dearest
do
if
you
do
mean
it
the
thought
too
glorious
undine
lingered
in
his
arms
not
with
any
intent
of
tenderness
but
as
if
too
deeply
lost
in
a
new
train
of
thought
to
be
conscious
of
his
hold
i
suppose
most
of
the
things
could
be
got
ready
sooner
if
i
said
they
must
she
brooded
with
a
fixed
gaze
that
travelled
past
him
and
the
rest
why
should
the
rest
be
sent
over
to
europe
after
us
i
want
to
go
straight
off
with
you
away
from
everything
ever
so
far
away
where
there
be
nobody
but
you
and
me
alone
she
had
a
flash
of
illumination
which
made
her
turn
her
lips
to
his
oh
my
darling
my
darling
marvell
whispered
x
and
spragg
were
both
given
to
such
long
periods
of
ruminating
apathy
that
the
student
of
inheritance
might
have
wondered
whence
undine
derived
her
overflowing
activity
the
answer
would
have
been
obtained
by
observing
her
father
business
life
from
the
moment
he
set
foot
in
wall
street
spragg
became
another
man
physically
the
change
revealed
itself
only
by
the
subtlest
signs
as
he
steered
his
way
to
his
office
through
the
jostling
crowd
of
william
street
his
relaxed
muscles
did
not
grow
more
taut
or
his
lounging
gait
less
desultory
his
shoulders
were
hollowed
by
the
usual
droop
and
his
rusty
black
waistcoat
showed
the
same
creased
concavity
at
the
waist
the
same
flabby
prominence
below
it
was
only
in
his
face
that
the
difference
was
perceptible
though
even
here
it
rather
lurked
behind
the
features
than
openly
modified
them
showing
itself
now
and
then
in
the
cautious
glint
of
eyes
the
forward
thrust
of
black
brows
or
a
tightening
of
the
lax
lines
of
the
mouth
as
the
gleam
of
a
light
might
flash
across
the
darkness
of
a
shuttered
the
shutters
were
more
tightly
barred
than
usual
when
on
a
morning
some
two
weeks
later
than
the
date
of
the
incidents
last
recorded
spragg
approached
the
steel
and
concrete
tower
in
which
his
office
occupied
a
lofty
events
had
moved
rapidly
and
somewhat
surprisingly
in
the
interval
and
spragg
had
already
accustomed
himself
to
the
fact
that
his
daughter
was
to
be
married
within
the
week
instead
of
awaiting
the
traditional
date
conventionally
the
change
meant
little
to
him
but
on
the
practical
side
it
presented
unforeseen
difficulties
spragg
had
learned
within
the
last
weeks
that
a
new
york
marriage
involved
material
obligations
unknown
to
apex
marvell
indeed
had
been
loftily
careless
of
such
questions
but
his
grandfather
on
the
announcement
of
the
engagement
had
called
on
spragg
and
put
before
him
with
polished
precision
the
young
man
financial
situation
spragg
at
the
moment
had
been
inclined
to
deal
with
his
visitor
in
a
spirit
of
indulgent
irony
as
he
leaned
back
in
his
revolving
chair
with
feet
adroitly
balanced
against
a
tilted
scrap
basket
his
air
of
relaxed
power
made
dagonet
venerable
elegance
seem
as
harmless
as
that
of
an
ivory
and
his
first
replies
to
his
visitor
were
made
with
the
mildness
of
a
kindly
giant
ralph
do
make
a
living
out
of
the
law
you
say
no
it
did
strike
me
he
be
likely
to
from
the
talks
i
had
with
him
fact
is
the
law
a
business
that
wants
spragg
broke
off
checked
by
a
protest
from
dagonet
oh
a
profession
you
call
it
it
a
business
his
smile
grew
more
indulgent
as
this
novel
distinction
dawned
on
him
why
i
guess
that
the
whole
trouble
with
ralph
nobody
expects
to
make
money
in
a
profession
and
if
you
taught
him
to
regard
the
law
that
way
he
better
go
right
into
and
done
with
it
dagonet
within
a
narrower
range
had
his
own
play
of
humour
and
it
met
spragg
with
a
leap
it
because
i
knew
he
would
manage
to
make
as
unremunerative
as
a
profession
that
i
saved
him
from
so
glaring
a
failure
by
putting
him
into
the
law
the
retort
drew
a
grunt
of
amusement
from
spragg
and
the
eyes
of
the
two
men
met
in
unexpected
understanding
that
so
what
can
he
do
then
the
future
enquired
he
can
write
poetry
at
least
he
tells
me
he
can
dagonet
hesitated
as
if
aware
of
the
inadequacy
of
the
alternative
and
then
added
and
he
can
count
on
three
thousand
a
year
from
me
spragg
tilted
himself
farther
back
without
disturbing
his
relation
to
the
scrap
basket
does
it
cost
anything
like
that
to
print
his
poetry
dagonet
smiled
again
he
was
clearly
enjoying
his
visit
dear
no
he
does
go
in
for
editions
and
now
and
then
he
gets
ten
dollars
from
a
magazine
spragg
mused
was
he
ever
taught
to
work
no
i
really
could
have
afforded
that
i
see
then
they
got
to
live
on
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
a
month
dagonet
remained
pleasantly
unmoved
does
it
cost
anything
like
that
to
buy
your
daughter
dresses
a
subterranean
chuckle
agitated
the
lower
folds
of
waistcoat
i
might
put
him
in
the
way
of
something
i
guess
he
smart
enough
dagonet
made
a
gesture
of
friendly
warning
it
will
pay
us
both
in
the
end
to
keep
him
out
of
business
he
said
rising
as
if
to
show
that
his
mission
was
accomplished
the
results
of
this
friendly
conference
had
been
more
serious
than
spragg
could
have
foreseen
and
the
victory
remained
with
his
antagonist
it
had
not
entered
into
spragg
calculations
that
he
would
have
to
give
his
daughter
any
fixed
income
on
her
marriage
he
meant
that
she
should
have
the
handsomest
wedding
the
new
york
press
had
ever
celebrated
and
her
mother
fancy
was
already
afloat
on
a
sea
of
luxuries
a
motor
a
fifth
avenue
house
and
a
tiara
that
should
van
degen
but
these
were
movable
benefits
to
be
conferred
whenever
spragg
happened
to
be
on
the
right
side
of
the
market
it
was
a
different
matter
to
be
called
on
at
such
short
notice
to
bridge
the
gap
between
young
marvell
allowance
and
requirements
and
her
father
immediate
conclusion
was
that
the
engagement
had
better
be
broken
off
such
scissions
were
almost
painless
in
apex
and
he
had
fancied
it
would
be
easy
by
an
appeal
to
the
pride
to
make
her
see
that
she
owed
it
to
herself
to
do
better
you
better
wait
awhile
and
look
round
again
was
the
way
he
had
put
it
to
her
at
the
opening
of
the
talk
of
which
even
now
he
could
not
recall
the
close
without
a
tremor
undine
when
she
took
his
meaning
had
been
terrible
everything
had
gone
down
before
her
as
towns
and
villages
went
down
before
one
of
the
tornadoes
of
her
native
state
wait
awhile
look
round
did
he
suppose
she
was
marrying
for
money
did
he
see
it
was
all
a
question
now
and
here
of
the
kind
of
people
she
wanted
to
go
with
did
he
want
to
throw
her
straight
back
into
the
lipscomb
set
to
have
her
marry
a
dentist
and
live
in
a
west
side
flat
why
had
they
stayed
in
apex
if
that
was
all
he
thought
she
was
fit
for
she
might
as
well
have
married
millard
binch
instead
of
handing
him
over
to
indiana
frusk
her
father
understand
that
nice
girls
in
new
york
did
regard
getting
married
like
going
on
a
it
was
enough
to
ruin
a
girl
chances
if
she
broke
her
engagement
to
a
man
in
ralph
set
all
kinds
of
spiteful
things
would
be
said
about
her
and
she
would
never
be
able
to
go
with
the
right
people
again
they
had
better
go
back
to
apex
right
off
it
was
they
and
not
she
who
had
wanted
to
leave
apex
anyhow
she
could
call
her
mother
to
witness
it
she
had
always
when
it
came
to
that
done
what
her
father
and
mother
wanted
but
she
given
up
trying
to
make
out
what
they
were
after
unless
it
was
to
make
her
miserable
and
if
that
was
it
had
they
had
enough
of
it
by
this
time
she
had
anyhow
but
after
this
she
meant
to
lead
her
own
life
and
they
need
ask
her
where
she
was
going
or
what
she
meant
to
do
because
this
time
she
die
before
she
told
them
and
they
made
life
so
hateful
to
her
that
she
only
wished
she
was
dead
already
spragg
heard
her
out
in
silence
pulling
at
his
beard
with
one
sallow
wrinkled
hand
while
the
other
dragged
down
the
armhole
of
his
waistcoat
suddenly
he
looked
up
and
said
ai
you
in
love
with
the
fellow
undie
the
girl
glared
back
at
him
her
splendid
brows
beetling
like
an
amazon
do
you
think
i
care
a
cent
for
all
the
rest
of
it
if
i
was
well
if
you
are
you
and
he
wo
mind
beginning
in
a
small
way
her
look
poured
contempt
on
his
ignorance
do
you
i
drag
him
down
with
a
magnificent
gesture
she
tore
marvell
ring
from
her
finger
i
send
this
back
this
minute
i
tell
him
i
thought
he
was
a
rich
man
and
now
i
see
i
mistaken
she
burst
into
shattering
sobs
rocking
her
beautiful
body
back
and
forward
in
all
the
abandonment
of
young
grief
and
her
father
stood
over
her
stroking
her
shoulder
and
saying
helplessly
i
see
what
i
can
do
undine
all
his
life
and
at
intervals
spragg
had
been
called
on
by
his
womenkind
to
see
what
he
could
do
and
the
seeing
had
almost
always
resulted
as
they
wished
undine
did
not
have
to
send
back
her
ring
and
in
her
state
of
happiness
she
hardly
asked
by
what
means
her
path
had
been
smoothed
but
merely
accepted
her
assurance
that
father
had
fixed
everything
all
right
spragg
accepted
the
situation
also
a
who
expected
to
be
pensioned
like
a
grand
army
veteran
was
a
phenomenon
new
to
his
experience
but
if
that
was
what
undine
wanted
she
should
have
it
only
two
days
later
however
he
was
met
by
a
new
demand
the
young
people
had
decided
to
be
married
right
off
instead
of
waiting
till
june
this
change
of
plan
was
made
known
to
spragg
at
a
moment
when
he
was
peculiarly
unprepared
for
the
financial
readjustment
it
necessitated
he
had
always
declared
himself
able
to
cope
with
any
crisis
if
undine
and
her
mother
would
go
steady
but
he
now
warned
them
of
his
inability
to
keep
up
with
the
new
pace
they
had
set
undine
not
deigning
to
return
to
the
charge
had
commissioned
her
mother
to
speak
for
her
and
spragg
was
surprised
to
meet
in
his
wife
a
firmness
as
inflexible
as
his
daughter
i
ca
do
it
loot
ca
put
my
hand
on
the
cash
he
had
protested
but
spragg
fought
him
inch
by
inch
her
back
to
the
wall
flinging
out
at
last
as
he
pressed
her
closer
well
if
you
want
to
know
seen
elmer
the
bolt
reached
its
mark
and
her
husband
turned
an
agitated
face
on
her
elmer
what
on
earth
he
did
come
here
no
but
he
sat
next
to
her
the
other
night
at
the
theatre
and
wild
with
us
for
not
having
warned
her
spragg
scowl
drew
his
projecting
brows
together
warned
her
of
what
what
elmer
to
her
why
she
afraid
of
elmer
moffatt
she
afraid
of
his
talking
talking
what
on
earth
can
he
say
that
hurt
her
oh
i
do
know
spragg
wailed
she
so
nervous
i
can
hardly
get
a
word
out
of
her
spragg
whitening
face
showed
the
touch
of
a
new
fear
is
she
afraid
he
get
round
her
again
make
up
to
her
is
that
what
she
means
by
i
do
know
i
do
know
i
only
know
she
is
afraid
she
afraid
as
death
of
him
for
a
long
interval
they
sat
silently
looking
at
each
other
while
their
heavy
eyes
exchanged
conjectures
then
spragg
rose
from
his
chair
saying
as
he
took
up
his
hat
do
you
fret
leota
i
see
what
i
can
do
he
had
been
seeing
now
for
an
arduous
fortnight
and
the
strain
on
his
vision
had
resulted
in
a
state
of
tension
such
as
he
had
not
undergone
since
the
epic
days
of
the
pure
water
move
at
apex
it
was
not
his
habit
to
impart
his
fears
to
spragg
and
undine
and
they
continued
the
bridal
preparations
secure
in
their
invariable
experience
that
once
father
had
been
convinced
of
the
impossibility
of
evading
their
demands
he
might
be
trusted
to
satisfy
them
by
means
with
which
his
womenkind
need
not
concern
themselves
spragg
as
he
approached
his
office
on
the
morning
in
question
felt
reasonably
sure
of
fulfilling
these
expectations
but
he
reflected
that
a
few
more
such
victories
would
mean
disaster
he
entered
the
vast
marble
vestibule
of
the
ararat
trust
building
and
walked
toward
the
express
elevator
that
was
to
carry
him
up
to
his
office
at
the
door
of
the
elevator
a
man
turned
to
him
and
he
recognized
elmer
moffatt
who
put
out
his
hand
with
an
easy
gesture
spragg
did
not
ignore
the
gesture
he
did
not
even
withhold
his
hand
in
his
code
the
cut
as
a
conscious
sign
of
disapproval
did
not
exist
in
the
south
if
you
had
a
grudge
against
a
man
you
tried
to
shoot
him
in
the
west
you
tried
to
do
him
in
a
mean
turn
in
business
but
in
neither
region
was
the
cut
among
the
social
weapons
of
offense
spragg
therefore
seeing
moffatt
in
his
path
extended
a
lifeless
hand
while
he
faced
the
young
man
scowlingly
moffatt
met
the
hand
and
the
scowl
with
equal
coolness
going
up
to
your
office
i
was
on
my
way
there
the
elevator
door
rolled
back
and
spragg
entering
it
found
his
companion
at
his
side
they
remained
silent
during
the
ascent
to
spragg
threshold
but
there
the
latter
turned
to
enquire
ironically
of
moffatt
anything
left
to
say
moffatt
smiled
nothing
left
no
i
carrying
a
whole
new
line
of
goods
spragg
pondered
the
reply
then
he
opened
the
door
and
suffered
moffatt
to
follow
him
in
behind
an
inner
glazed
enclosure
with
its
one
window
dimmed
by
a
sooty
perspective
barred
with
chimneys
he
seated
himself
at
a
dusty
littered
desk
and
groped
instinctively
for
the
support
of
the
scrap
basket
moffatt
uninvited
dropped
into
the
nearest
chair
and
spragg
said
after
another
silence
i
pretty
busy
this
morning
i
know
you
are
that
why
i
here
moffatt
serenely
answered
he
leaned
back
crossing
his
legs
and
twisting
his
small
stiff
moustache
with
a
plump
hand
adorned
by
a
cameo
fact
is
he
went
on
this
is
a
call
you
think
i
owe
you
a
grudge
and
i
going
to
show
you
i
not
that
kind
i
going
to
put
you
onto
a
good
thing
oh
not
because
i
so
fond
of
you
just
because
it
happens
to
hit
my
sense
of
a
joke
while
moffatt
talked
spragg
took
up
the
pile
of
letters
on
his
desk
and
sat
shuffling
them
like
a
pack
of
cards
he
dealt
them
deliberately
to
two
imaginary
players
then
he
pushed
them
aside
and
drew
out
his
watch
all
right
i
carry
one
too
said
the
young
man
easily
but
find
it
time
gained
to
hear
what
i
got
to
say
spragg
considered
the
vista
of
chimneys
without
speaking
and
moffatt
continued
i
do
suppose
you
care
to
hear
the
story
of
my
life
so
i
wo
refer
you
to
the
back
numbers
you
used
to
say
out
in
apex
that
i
spent
too
much
time
loafing
round
the
bar
of
the
mealey
house
that
was
one
of
the
things
you
had
against
me
well
maybe
i
did
but
it
taught
me
to
talk
and
to
listen
to
the
other
fellows
too
just
at
present
i
one
of
harmon
driscoll
private
secretaries
and
some
of
that
mealey
house
loafing
has
come
in
more
useful
than
any
job
i
ever
put
my
hand
to
the
old
man
happened
to
hear
i
knew
something
about
the
inside
of
the
eubaw
deal
and
took
me
on
to
have
the
information
where
he
could
get
at
it
i
given
him
good
talk
for
his
money
but
i
done
some
listening
too
eubaw
ai
the
only
commodity
the
driscolls
deal
in
spragg
restored
his
watch
to
his
pocket
and
shifted
his
drowsy
gaze
from
the
window
to
his
visitor
face
yes
said
moffatt
as
if
in
reply
to
the
movement
the
driscolls
are
getting
busy
out
in
apex
now
they
got
all
the
street
railroads
in
their
pocket
they
want
the
too
but
you
know
that
as
well
as
i
do
fact
is
they
got
to
have
it
and
there
where
you
and
i
come
in
spragg
thrust
his
hands
in
his
waistcoat
and
turned
his
eyes
back
to
the
window
i
out
of
that
long
ago
he
said
indifferently
sure
moffatt
acquiesced
but
you
know
what
went
on
when
you
were
in
it
well
said
spragg
shifting
one
hand
to
the
masonic
emblem
on
his
well
representative
james
rolliver
who
was
in
it
with
you
out
of
it
yet
he
the
man
the
driscolls
are
up
against
what
know
about
him
spragg
twirled
the
emblem
thoughtfully
driscoll
tell
you
to
come
here
moffatt
laughed
no
sir
not
by
a
good
many
miles
spragg
removed
his
feet
from
the
scrap
basket
and
straightened
himself
in
his
chair
well
i
did
either
good
morning
mr
moffatt
the
young
man
stared
a
moment
a
humorous
glint
in
his
small
black
eyes
but
he
made
no
motion
to
leave
his
seat
undine
to
be
married
next
week
is
she
he
asked
in
a
conversational
tone
spragg
face
blackened
and
he
swung
about
in
his
revolving
chair
you
go
to
moffatt
raised
a
deprecating
hand
oh
you
need
warn
me
off
i
do
want
to
be
invited
to
the
wedding
and
i
do
want
to
forbid
the
banns
there
was
a
derisive
sound
in
spragg
throat
but
i
do
want
to
get
out
of
driscoll
office
moffatt
imperturbably
continued
there
no
future
there
for
a
fellow
like
me
i
see
things
big
that
the
reason
apex
was
too
tight
a
fit
for
me
it
only
the
little
fellows
that
succeed
in
little
places
new
york
my
size
without
a
single
alteration
i
could
prove
it
to
you
if
i
could
put
my
hand
on
fifty
thousand
dollars
spragg
did
not
repeat
his
gesture
of
dismissal
he
was
once
more
listening
guardedly
but
intently
moffatt
saw
it
and
continued
and
i
could
put
my
hand
on
double
that
sum
yes
sir
double
if
just
step
round
with
me
to
old
driscoll
office
before
five
see
the
connection
mr
spragg
the
older
man
remained
silent
while
his
visitor
hummed
a
bar
or
two
of
in
the
gloaming
then
he
said
you
want
me
to
tell
driscoll
what
i
know
about
james
j
rolliver
i
want
you
to
tell
the
truth
i
want
you
to
stand
for
political
purity
in
your
native
state
a
man
of
your
prominence
owes
it
to
the
community
sir
cried
moffatt
spragg
was
still
tormenting
his
masonic
emblem
rolliver
and
i
always
stood
together
he
said
at
last
with
a
tinge
of
reluctance
well
how
much
have
you
made
out
of
it
ai
he
always
been
ahead
of
the
game
i
ca
do
it
i
ca
do
it
said
spragg
bringing
his
clenched
hand
down
on
the
desk
as
if
addressing
an
invisible
throng
of
assailants
moffatt
rose
without
any
evidence
of
disappointment
in
his
ruddy
countenance
well
so
long
he
said
moving
toward
the
door
near
the
threshold
he
paused
to
add
carelessly
excuse
my
referring
to
a
personal
matter
but
i
understand
miss
spragg
wedding
takes
place
next
monday
spragg
was
silent
how
that
moffatt
continued
unabashed
i
saw
in
the
papers
the
date
was
set
for
the
end
of
june
spragg
rose
heavily
from
his
seat
i
presume
my
daughter
has
her
reasons
he
said
moving
toward
the
door
in
moffatt
wake
i
guess
she
has
same
as
i
have
for
wanting
you
to
step
round
with
me
to
old
driscoll
if
undine
reasons
are
as
good
as
mine
stop
right
here
elmer
moffatt
the
older
man
broke
out
with
lifted
hand
moffatt
made
a
burlesque
feint
of
evading
a
blow
then
his
face
grew
serious
and
he
moved
close
to
spragg
whose
arm
had
fallen
to
his
side
see
here
i
know
undine
reasons
i
had
a
talk
with
her
she
tell
you
she
do
beat
about
the
bush
the
way
you
do
she
told
me
straight
out
what
was
bothering
her
she
wants
the
marvells
to
think
she
right
out
of
kindergarten
goods
sent
out
on
approval
from
this
counter
and
i
see
her
point
do
mean
to
publish
my
only
a
deal
a
deal
he
paused
a
moment
twisting
his
fingers
about
the
heavy
gold
that
crossed
his
waistcoat
tell
you
what
spragg
i
do
bear
malice
not
against
undine
anyway
and
if
i
could
have
afforded
it
i
have
been
glad
enough
to
oblige
her
and
forget
old
times
but
you
did
hesitate
to
kick
me
when
i
was
down
and
it
taken
me
a
day
or
two
to
get
on
my
legs
again
after
that
kicking
i
see
my
way
now
to
get
there
and
keep
there
and
a
kinder
poetic
justice
in
your
being
the
man
to
help
me
up
if
i
can
get
hold
of
fifty
thousand
dollars
within
a
day
or
so
i
do
care
got
the
start
of
me
i
got
a
dead
sure
thing
in
sight
and
you
the
only
man
that
can
get
it
for
me
now
do
you
see
where
we
coming
out
spragg
during
this
discourse
had
remained
motionless
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
jaws
moving
mechanically
as
though
he
mumbled
a
under
his
beard
his
sallow
cheek
had
turned
a
shade
paler
and
his
brows
hung
threateningly
over
his
eyes
but
there
was
no
threat
there
was
scarcely
more
than
a
note
of
dull
curiosity
in
the
voice
with
which
he
said
you
mean
to
talk
moffatt
rosy
face
grew
as
hard
as
a
steel
safe
i
mean
you
to
talk
to
old
driscoll
he
paused
and
then
added
it
a
hundred
thousand
down
between
us
spragg
once
more
consulted
his
watch
i
see
you
again
he
said
with
an
effort
moffatt
struck
one
fist
against
the
other
no
sir
you
wo
only
hear
from
me
through
the
marvell
family
your
news
ai
worth
a
dollar
to
driscoll
if
he
do
get
it
he
was
checked
by
the
sound
of
steps
in
the
outer
office
and
spragg
stenographer
appeared
in
the
doorway
it
marvell
she
announced
and
ralph
marvell
glowing
with
haste
and
happiness
stood
between
the
two
men
holding
out
his
hand
to
spragg
am
i
awfully
in
the
way
sir
turn
me
out
if
i
am
but
first
let
me
just
say
a
word
about
this
necklace
i
ordered
for
un
he
broke
off
made
aware
by
spragg
glance
of
the
presence
of
elmer
moffatt
who
with
unwonted
discretion
had
dropped
back
into
the
shadow
of
the
door
marvell
turned
on
moffatt
a
bright
gaze
full
of
the
instinctive
hospitality
of
youth
but
moffatt
looked
straight
past
him
at
spragg
the
latter
as
if
in
response
to
an
imperceptible
signal
mechanically
pronounced
his
visitor
name
and
the
two
young
men
moved
toward
each
other
i
beg
your
pardon
most
awfully
am
i
breaking
up
an
important
conference
ralph
asked
as
he
shook
hands
why
no
i
guess
we
pretty
nearly
through
i
step
outside
and
woo
the
blonde
while
you
talking
moffatt
rejoined
in
the
same
key
thanks
so
much
i
sha
take
two
seconds
ralph
broke
off
to
scrutinize
him
but
have
we
met
before
it
seems
to
me
i
seen
you
just
lately
moffatt
seemed
about
to
answer
but
his
reply
was
checked
by
an
abrupt
movement
on
the
part
of
spragg
there
was
a
perceptible
pause
during
which
moffatt
bright
black
glance
rested
questioningly
on
ralph
then
he
looked
again
at
the
older
man
and
their
eyes
held
each
other
for
a
silent
moment
why
no
not
as
i
aware
of
marvell
moffatt
said
addressing
himself
amicably
to
ralph
better
late
than
never
though
and
i
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
soon
again
he
divided
a
nod
between
the
two
men
and
passed
into
the
outer
office
where
they
heard
him
addressing
the
stenographer
in
a
strain
of
exaggerated
gallantry
xi
the
july
sun
enclosed
in
a
ring
of
fire
the
ilex
grove
of
a
villa
in
the
hills
near
siena
below
by
the
roadside
the
long
yellow
house
seemed
to
waver
and
palpitate
in
the
glare
but
steep
by
steep
behind
it
the
cool
mounted
to
the
ledge
where
ralph
marvell
stretched
on
his
back
in
the
grass
lay
gazing
up
at
a
black
reticulation
of
branches
between
which
bits
of
sky
gleamed
with
the
hardness
and
brilliancy
of
blue
enamel
up
there
too
the
air
was
thick
with
heat
but
compared
with
the
white
fire
below
it
was
a
dim
and
tempered
warmth
like
that
of
the
churches
in
which
he
and
undine
sometimes
took
refuge
at
the
height
of
the
torrid
days
ralph
loved
the
heavy
italian
summer
as
he
had
loved
the
light
spring
days
leading
up
to
it
the
long
line
of
dancing
days
that
had
drawn
them
on
and
on
ever
since
they
had
left
their
ship
at
naples
four
months
earlier
four
months
of
beauty
changeful
inexhaustible
weaving
itself
about
him
in
shapes
of
softness
and
strength
and
beside
him
hand
in
hand
with
him
embodying
that
spirit
of
shifting
magic
the
radiant
creature
through
whose
eyes
he
saw
it
this
was
what
their
hastened
marriage
had
blessed
them
with
giving
them
leisure
before
summer
came
to
penetrate
to
remote
folds
of
the
southern
mountains
to
linger
in
the
shade
of
sicilian
and
finally
travelling
by
slow
stages
to
the
adriatic
to
reach
the
central
where
even
in
july
they
might
hope
for
a
breathable
air
to
ralph
the
sienese
air
was
not
only
breathable
but
intoxicating
the
sun
treading
the
earth
like
a
vintager
drew
from
it
heady
fragrances
crushed
out
of
it
new
colours
all
the
values
of
the
temperate
landscape
were
reversed
the
noon
were
whiter
but
the
shadows
had
unimagined
colour
on
the
blackness
of
cork
and
ilex
and
cypress
lay
the
green
and
purple
lustres
the
coppery
iridescences
of
old
bronze
and
night
after
night
the
skies
were
and
bubbling
with
stars
ralph
said
to
himself
that
no
one
who
had
not
seen
italy
thus
prostrate
beneath
the
sun
knew
what
secret
treasures
she
could
yield
as
he
lay
there
fragments
of
past
states
of
emotion
fugitive
felicities
of
thought
and
sensation
rose
and
floated
on
the
surface
of
his
thoughts
it
was
one
of
those
moments
when
the
accumulated
impressions
of
life
converge
on
heart
and
brain
elucidating
enlacing
each
other
in
a
mysterious
confusion
of
beauty
he
had
had
glimpses
of
such
a
state
before
of
such
mergings
of
the
personal
with
the
general
life
that
one
felt
one
self
a
mere
wave
on
the
wild
stream
of
being
yet
thrilled
with
a
sharper
sense
of
individuality
than
can
be
known
within
the
mere
bounds
of
the
actual
but
now
he
knew
the
sensation
in
its
fulness
and
with
it
came
the
releasing
power
of
language
words
were
flashing
like
brilliant
birds
through
the
boughs
overhead
he
had
but
to
wave
his
magic
wand
to
have
them
flutter
down
to
him
only
they
were
so
beautiful
up
there
weaving
their
fantastic
flights
against
the
blue
that
it
was
pleasanter
for
the
moment
to
watch
them
and
let
the
wand
lie
he
stared
up
at
the
pattern
they
made
till
his
eyes
ached
with
excess
of
light
then
he
changed
his
position
and
looked
at
his
wife
undine
near
by
leaned
against
a
gnarled
tree
with
the
slightly
constrained
air
of
a
person
unused
to
sylvan
abandonments
her
beautiful
back
could
not
adapt
itself
to
the
irregularities
of
the
and
she
moved
a
little
now
and
then
in
the
effort
to
find
an
easier
position
but
her
expression
was
serene
and
ralph
looking
up
at
her
through
drowsy
lids
thought
her
face
had
never
been
more
exquisite
you
look
as
cool
as
a
wave
he
said
reaching
out
for
the
hand
on
her
knee
she
let
him
have
it
and
he
drew
it
closer
scrutinizing
it
as
if
it
had
been
a
bit
of
precious
porcelain
or
ivory
it
was
small
and
soft
a
mere
featherweight
a
of
a
hand
not
quick
and
thrilling
not
a
speaking
hand
but
one
to
be
fondled
and
dressed
in
rings
and
to
leave
a
rosy
blur
in
the
brain
the
fingers
were
short
and
tapering
dimpled
at
the
base
with
nails
as
smooth
as
ralph
lifted
them
one
by
one
like
a
child
playing
with
but
they
were
inelastic
and
did
not
spring
back
far
only
far
enough
to
show
the
dimples
he
turned
the
hand
over
and
traced
the
course
of
its
blue
veins
from
the
wrist
to
the
rounding
of
the
palm
below
the
fingers
then
he
put
a
kiss
in
the
warm
hollow
between
the
upper
world
had
vanished
his
universe
had
shrunk
to
the
palm
of
a
hand
but
there
was
no
sense
of
diminution
in
the
mystic
depths
whence
his
passion
sprang
earthly
dimensions
were
ignored
and
the
curve
of
beauty
was
boundless
enough
to
hold
whatever
the
imagination
could
pour
into
it
ralph
had
never
felt
more
convinced
of
his
power
to
write
a
great
poem
but
now
it
was
undine
hand
which
held
the
magic
wand
of
expression
she
stirred
again
uneasily
answering
his
last
words
with
a
faint
accent
of
reproach
i
do
feel
cool
you
said
there
be
a
breeze
up
he
laughed
you
poor
darling
was
it
ever
as
hot
as
this
in
apex
she
withdrew
her
hand
with
a
slight
grimace
yes
but
i
did
marry
you
to
go
back
to
apex
ralph
laughed
again
then
he
lifted
himself
on
his
elbow
and
regained
the
hand
i
wonder
what
you
did
marry
me
for
mercy
it
too
hot
for
conundrums
she
spoke
without
impatience
but
with
a
lassitude
less
joyous
than
his
he
roused
himself
do
you
really
mind
the
heat
so
much
we
go
if
you
do
she
sat
up
eagerly
go
to
switzerland
you
mean
well
i
had
taken
quite
as
long
a
leap
i
only
meant
we
might
drive
back
to
siena
she
relapsed
listlessly
against
her
oh
siena
hotter
than
this
we
could
go
and
sit
in
the
cathedral
it
always
cool
there
at
sunset
we
sat
in
the
cathedral
at
sunset
every
day
for
a
week
well
what
do
you
say
to
stopping
at
lecceto
on
the
way
i
shown
you
lecceto
yet
and
the
drive
back
by
moonlight
would
be
glorious
this
woke
her
to
a
slight
show
of
interest
it
might
be
nice
but
where
could
we
get
anything
to
eat
ralph
laughed
again
i
do
believe
we
could
you
too
practical
well
somebody
got
to
be
and
the
food
in
the
hotel
is
too
disgusting
if
we
not
on
time
i
admit
that
the
best
of
it
has
usually
been
appropriated
by
the
extremely
who
so
keen
to
know
you
undine
face
brightened
you
know
he
not
a
count
he
a
marquis
his
name
roviano
his
palace
in
rome
is
in
the
and
he
speaks
english
beautifully
celeste
found
out
about
him
from
the
headwaiter
she
said
with
the
security
of
one
who
treats
of
recognized
values
marvell
sitting
upright
reached
lazily
across
the
grass
for
his
hat
then
there
all
the
more
reason
for
rushing
back
to
defend
our
share
he
spoke
in
the
bantering
tone
which
had
become
the
habitual
expression
of
his
tenderness
but
his
eyes
softened
as
they
absorbed
in
a
last
glance
the
glimmering
submarine
light
of
the
ancient
grove
through
which
undine
figure
wavered
above
him
you
never
looked
your
name
more
than
you
do
now
he
said
kneeling
at
her
side
and
putting
his
arm
about
her
she
smiled
back
a
little
vaguely
as
if
not
seizing
his
allusion
and
being
content
to
let
it
drop
into
the
store
of
unexplained
references
which
had
once
stimulated
her
curiosity
but
now
merely
gave
her
leisure
to
think
of
other
things
but
her
smile
was
no
less
lovely
for
its
vagueness
and
indeed
to
ralph
the
loveliness
was
enhanced
by
the
latent
doubt
he
remembered
afterward
that
at
that
moment
the
cup
of
life
seemed
to
brim
over
come
dear
here
or
there
it
all
divine
in
the
carriage
however
she
remained
insensible
to
the
soft
spell
of
the
evening
noticing
only
the
heat
and
dust
and
saying
as
they
passed
under
the
wooded
cliff
of
lecceto
that
they
might
as
well
have
stopped
there
after
all
since
with
such
a
headache
as
she
felt
coming
on
she
did
care
if
she
dined
or
not
ralph
looked
up
yearningly
at
the
long
walls
overhead
but
undine
mood
was
hardly
favourable
to
communion
with
such
scenes
and
he
made
no
attempt
to
stop
the
carriage
instead
he
presently
said
if
you
tired
of
italy
we
got
the
world
to
choose
from
she
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
then
she
said
it
the
heat
i
tired
of
do
people
generally
come
here
earlier
yes
that
why
i
chose
the
summer
so
that
we
could
have
it
all
to
ourselves
she
tried
to
put
a
note
of
reasonableness
into
her
voice
if
you
told
me
we
were
going
everywhere
at
the
wrong
time
of
course
i
could
have
arranged
about
my
clothes
you
poor
darling
let
us
by
all
means
go
to
the
place
where
the
clothes
will
be
right
they
too
beautiful
to
be
left
out
of
our
scheme
of
life
her
lips
hardened
i
know
you
do
care
how
i
look
but
you
give
me
time
to
order
anything
before
we
were
married
and
i
got
nothing
but
my
last
winter
things
to
wear
ralph
smiled
even
his
subjugated
mind
perceived
the
inconsistency
of
undine
taxing
him
with
having
hastened
their
marriage
but
her
variations
on
the
eternal
feminine
still
enchanted
him
we
go
wherever
you
please
you
make
every
place
the
one
place
he
said
as
if
he
were
humouring
an
irresistible
child
to
switzerland
then
celeste
says
moritz
is
too
heavenly
exclaimed
undine
who
gathered
her
ideas
of
europe
chiefly
from
the
conversation
of
her
experienced
attendant
one
can
be
cool
short
of
the
engadine
why
not
go
south
again
say
to
capri
capri
is
that
the
island
we
saw
from
naples
where
the
artists
go
she
drew
her
brows
together
it
would
be
simply
awful
getting
there
in
this
heat
well
then
i
know
a
little
place
in
switzerland
where
one
can
still
get
away
from
the
crowd
and
we
can
sit
and
look
at
a
green
while
i
lie
in
wait
for
adjectives
spragg
astonishment
on
learning
that
his
contemplated
maintaining
a
household
on
the
earnings
of
his
muse
was
still
matter
for
pleasantry
between
the
pair
and
one
of
the
humours
of
their
first
weeks
together
had
consisted
in
picturing
themselves
as
a
primeval
couple
setting
forth
across
a
virgin
continent
and
subsisting
on
the
adjectives
which
ralph
was
to
trap
for
his
epic
on
this
occasion
however
his
wife
did
not
take
up
the
joke
and
he
remained
silent
while
their
carriage
climbed
the
long
dusty
hill
to
the
fontebranda
gate
he
had
seen
her
face
droop
as
he
suggested
the
possibility
of
an
escape
from
the
crowds
in
switzerland
and
it
came
to
him
with
the
sharpness
of
a
that
a
crowd
was
what
she
wanted
that
she
was
sick
to
death
of
being
alone
with
him
he
sat
motionless
staring
ahead
at
the
walls
and
towers
on
the
steep
above
them
after
all
there
was
nothing
sudden
in
his
discovery
for
weeks
it
had
hung
on
the
edge
of
consciousness
but
he
had
turned
from
it
with
the
heart
instinctive
clinging
to
the
unrealities
by
which
it
lives
even
now
a
hundred
qualifying
reasons
rushed
to
his
aid
they
told
him
it
was
not
of
himself
that
undine
had
wearied
but
only
of
their
present
way
of
life
he
had
said
a
moment
before
without
conscious
exaggeration
that
her
presence
made
any
place
the
one
place
yet
how
willingly
would
he
have
consented
to
share
in
such
a
life
as
she
was
leading
before
their
marriage
and
he
had
to
acknowledge
their
months
of
desultory
wandering
from
one
remote
italian
to
another
must
have
seemed
as
purposeless
to
her
as
balls
and
dinners
would
have
been
to
him
an
imagination
like
his
peopled
with
such
varied
images
and
associations
fed
by
so
many
currents
from
the
long
stream
of
human
experience
could
hardly
picture
the
bareness
of
the
small
place
in
which
his
wife
spirit
fluttered
her
mind
was
as
destitute
of
beauty
and
mystery
as
the
prairie
in
which
she
had
been
educated
and
her
ideals
seemed
to
ralph
as
pathetic
as
the
ornaments
made
of
corks
and
with
which
her
infant
hands
had
been
taught
to
adorn
it
he
was
beginning
to
understand
this
and
learning
to
adapt
himself
to
the
narrow
compass
of
her
experience
the
task
of
opening
new
windows
in
her
mind
was
inspiring
enough
to
give
him
infinite
patience
and
he
would
not
yet
own
to
himself
that
her
pliancy
and
variety
were
imitative
rather
than
spontaneous
meanwhile
he
had
no
desire
to
sacrifice
her
wishes
to
his
and
it
distressed
him
that
he
dared
not
confess
his
real
reason
for
avoiding
the
engadine
the
truth
was
that
their
funds
were
shrinking
faster
than
he
had
expected
spragg
after
bluntly
opposing
their
hastened
marriage
on
the
ground
that
he
was
not
prepared
at
such
short
notice
to
make
the
necessary
provision
for
his
daughter
had
shortly
afterward
probably
as
undine
observed
to
ralph
in
consequence
of
a
lucky
turn
in
the
street
met
their
wishes
with
all
possible
liberality
bestowing
on
them
a
wedding
in
conformity
with
spragg
ideals
and
up
to
the
highest
standard
of
heeny
clippings
and
pledging
himself
to
provide
undine
with
an
income
adequate
to
so
brilliant
a
beginning
it
was
understood
that
ralph
on
their
return
should
renounce
the
law
for
some
more
paying
business
but
this
seemed
the
smallest
of
sacrifices
to
make
for
the
privilege
of
calling
undine
his
wife
and
besides
he
still
secretly
hoped
that
in
the
interval
his
real
vocation
might
declare
itself
in
some
work
which
would
justify
his
adopting
the
life
of
letters
he
had
assumed
that
undine
allowance
with
the
addition
of
his
own
small
income
would
be
enough
to
satisfy
their
needs
his
own
were
few
and
had
always
been
within
his
means
but
his
wife
daily
requirements
combined
with
her
intermittent
outbreaks
of
extravagance
had
thrown
out
all
his
calculations
and
they
were
already
seriously
exceeding
their
income
if
any
one
had
prophesied
before
his
marriage
that
he
would
find
it
difficult
to
tell
this
to
undine
he
would
have
smiled
at
the
suggestion
and
during
their
first
days
together
it
had
seemed
as
though
pecuniary
questions
were
the
last
likely
to
be
raised
between
them
but
his
marital
education
had
since
made
strides
and
he
now
knew
that
a
disregard
for
money
may
imply
not
the
willingness
to
get
on
without
it
but
merely
a
blind
confidence
that
it
will
somehow
be
provided
if
undine
like
the
lilies
of
the
field
took
no
care
it
was
not
because
her
wants
were
as
few
but
because
she
assumed
that
care
would
be
taken
for
her
by
those
whose
privilege
it
was
to
enable
her
to
unite
floral
insouciance
with
sheban
elegance
she
had
met
ralph
first
note
of
warning
with
the
assurance
that
she
did
mean
to
worry
and
her
tone
implied
that
it
was
his
business
to
do
so
for
her
he
certainly
wanted
to
guard
her
from
this
as
from
all
other
cares
he
wanted
also
and
still
more
passionately
after
the
topic
had
once
or
twice
recurred
between
them
to
guard
himself
from
the
risk
of
judging
where
he
still
adored
these
restraints
to
frankness
kept
him
silent
during
the
remainder
of
the
drive
and
when
after
dinner
undine
again
complained
of
her
headache
he
let
her
go
up
to
her
room
and
wandered
out
into
the
dimly
lit
streets
to
renewed
communion
with
his
problems
they
hung
on
him
insistently
as
darkness
fell
and
siena
grew
vocal
with
that
shrill
diversity
of
sounds
that
breaks
on
summer
nights
from
every
cleft
of
the
masonry
in
old
italian
towns
then
the
moon
rose
unfolding
depth
by
depth
the
lines
of
the
antique
land
and
ralph
leaning
against
an
old
brick
parapet
and
watching
each
remoteness
disclose
itself
between
the
dark
masses
of
the
middle
distance
felt
his
spirit
enlarged
and
pacified
for
the
first
time
as
his
senses
thrilled
to
the
deep
touch
of
beauty
he
asked
himself
if
out
of
these
floating
and
fugitive
vibrations
he
might
not
build
something
concrete
and
stable
if
even
such
dull
common
cares
as
now
oppressed
him
might
not
become
the
motive
power
of
creation
if
he
could
only
on
the
spot
do
something
with
all
the
accumulated
spoils
of
the
last
months
something
that
should
both
put
money
into
his
pocket
and
harmony
into
the
rich
confusion
of
his
spirit
i
write
i
write
that
must
be
what
the
whole
thing
means
he
said
to
himself
with
a
vague
clutch
at
some
solution
which
should
keep
him
a
little
longer
hanging
down
the
steep
of
disenchantment
he
would
have
stayed
on
heedless
of
time
to
trace
the
ramifications
of
his
idea
in
the
complex
beauty
of
the
scene
but
for
the
longing
to
share
his
mood
with
undine
for
the
last
few
months
every
thought
and
sensation
had
been
instantly
transmuted
into
such
emotional
impulses
and
though
the
currents
of
communication
between
himself
and
undine
were
neither
deep
nor
numerous
each
fresh
rush
of
feeling
seemed
strong
enough
to
clear
a
way
to
her
heart
he
hurried
back
almost
breathlessly
to
the
inn
but
even
as
he
knocked
at
her
door
the
subtle
emanation
of
other
influences
seemed
to
arrest
and
chill
him
she
had
put
out
the
lamp
and
sat
by
the
window
in
the
moonlight
her
head
propped
on
a
listless
hand
as
marvell
entered
she
turned
then
without
speaking
she
looked
away
again
he
was
used
to
this
mute
reception
and
had
learned
that
it
had
no
personal
motive
but
was
the
result
of
an
extremely
simplified
social
code
and
spragg
seldom
spoke
to
each
other
when
they
met
and
words
of
greeting
seemed
almost
unknown
to
their
domestic
vocabulary
marvell
at
first
had
fancied
that
his
own
warmth
would
call
forth
a
response
from
his
wife
who
had
been
so
quick
to
learn
the
forms
of
worldly
intercourse
but
he
soon
saw
that
she
regarded
intimacy
as
a
pretext
for
escaping
from
such
forms
into
a
total
absence
of
expression
however
he
felt
another
meaning
in
her
silence
and
perceived
that
she
intended
him
to
feel
it
he
met
it
by
silence
but
of
a
different
kind
letting
his
nearness
speak
for
him
as
he
knelt
beside
her
and
laid
his
cheek
against
hers
she
seemed
hardly
aware
of
the
gesture
but
to
that
he
was
also
used
she
had
never
shown
any
repugnance
to
his
tenderness
but
such
response
as
it
evoked
was
remote
and
suggesting
from
the
first
not
so
much
of
the
recoil
of
ignorance
as
the
coolness
of
the
element
from
which
she
took
her
name
as
he
pressed
her
to
him
she
seemed
to
grow
less
impassive
and
he
felt
her
resign
herself
like
a
tired
child
he
held
his
breath
not
daring
to
break
the
spell
at
length
he
whispered
i
just
seen
such
a
wonderful
thing
i
wish
you
been
with
me
what
sort
of
a
thing
she
turned
her
head
with
a
faint
show
of
interest
a
i
do
know
a
vision
it
came
to
me
out
there
just
now
with
the
moonrise
a
vision
her
interest
flagged
i
never
cared
much
about
spirits
mother
used
to
try
to
drag
me
to
seances
but
they
always
made
me
sleepy
ralph
laughed
i
do
mean
a
dead
spirit
but
a
living
one
i
saw
the
vision
of
a
book
i
mean
to
do
it
came
to
me
suddenly
magnificently
swooped
down
on
me
as
that
big
white
moon
swooped
down
on
the
black
landscape
tore
at
me
like
a
great
white
the
bird
of
jove
after
all
imagination
was
the
eagle
that
devoured
prometheus
she
drew
away
abruptly
and
the
bright
moonlight
showed
him
the
apprehension
in
her
face
you
not
going
to
write
a
book
here
he
stood
up
and
wandered
away
a
step
or
two
then
he
turned
and
came
back
of
course
not
here
wherever
you
want
the
main
point
is
that
it
come
to
me
no
that
it
come
back
to
me
for
it
all
these
months
together
it
all
our
happiness
it
the
meaning
of
life
that
i
found
and
it
you
dearest
you
who
given
it
to
me
he
dropped
down
beside
her
again
but
she
disengaged
herself
and
he
heard
a
little
sob
in
her
throat
undine
what
the
matter
nothing
i
do
know
i
suppose
i
homesick
homesick
you
poor
darling
you
tired
of
travelling
what
is
it
i
do
know
i
do
like
europe
it
not
what
i
expected
and
i
think
it
all
too
dreadfully
dreary
the
words
broke
from
her
in
a
long
wail
of
rebellion
marvell
gazed
at
her
perplexedly
it
seemed
strange
that
such
unguessed
thoughts
should
have
been
stirring
in
the
heart
pressed
to
his
less
interesting
than
you
expected
or
less
amusing
is
that
it
it
dirty
and
ugly
all
the
towns
we
been
to
are
disgustingly
dirty
i
loathe
the
smells
and
the
beggars
i
sick
and
tired
of
the
stuffy
rooms
in
the
hotels
i
thought
it
would
all
be
so
splendid
but
new
york
ever
so
much
nicer
not
new
york
in
july
i
do
care
there
are
the
anyway
and
there
are
always
people
round
all
these
places
seem
as
if
they
were
dead
it
all
like
some
awful
cemetery
a
sense
of
compunction
checked
marvell
laughter
do
cry
dear
do
i
see
i
understand
you
lonely
and
the
heat
has
tired
you
out
it
is
dull
here
awfully
dull
i
been
stupid
not
to
feel
it
but
we
start
at
once
we
get
out
of
it
she
brightened
instantly
we
go
up
to
switzerland
we
go
up
to
switzerland
he
had
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
the
quiet
place
with
the
green
where
he
might
have
made
tryst
with
his
vision
then
he
turned
his
mind
from
it
and
said
we
go
just
where
you
want
how
soon
can
you
be
ready
to
start
oh
the
first
thing
i
make
celeste
get
out
of
bed
now
and
pack
can
we
go
right
through
to
moritz
i
rather
sleep
in
the
train
than
in
another
of
these
awful
places
she
was
on
her
feet
in
a
flash
her
face
alight
her
hair
waving
and
floating
about
her
as
though
it
rose
on
her
happy
oh
ralph
it
sweet
of
you
and
i
love
you
she
cried
out
letting
him
take
her
to
his
breast
xii
in
the
quiet
place
with
the
green
ralph
vision
might
have
kept
faith
with
him
but
how
could
he
hope
to
surprise
it
in
the
midsummer
crowds
of
moritz
undine
at
any
rate
had
found
there
what
she
wanted
and
when
he
was
at
her
side
and
her
radiant
smile
included
him
every
other
question
was
in
abeyance
but
there
were
hours
of
solitary
striding
over
bare
grassy
slopes
face
to
face
with
the
ironic
interrogation
of
sky
and
mountains
when
his
anxieties
came
back
more
persistent
and
importunate
sometimes
they
took
the
form
of
merely
material
difficulties
how
for
instance
was
he
to
meet
the
cost
of
their
ruinous
suite
at
the
engadine
palace
while
he
awaited
next
remittance
and
once
the
hotel
bills
were
paid
what
would
be
left
for
the
journey
back
to
paris
the
looming
expenses
there
the
price
of
the
passage
to
america
these
questions
would
fling
him
back
on
the
thought
of
his
projected
book
which
was
after
all
to
be
what
the
masterpieces
of
literature
had
mostly
been
a
well
why
not
did
not
the
worshipper
always
heap
the
rarest
essences
on
the
altar
of
his
divinity
ralph
still
rejoiced
in
the
thought
of
giving
back
to
undine
something
of
the
beauty
of
their
first
months
together
but
even
on
his
solitary
walks
the
vision
eluded
him
and
he
could
spare
so
few
hours
to
its
pursuit
undine
days
were
crowded
and
it
was
still
a
matter
of
course
that
where
she
went
he
should
follow
he
had
risen
visibly
in
her
opinion
since
they
had
been
absorbed
into
the
life
of
the
big
hotels
and
she
had
seen
that
his
command
of
foreign
tongues
put
him
at
an
advantage
even
in
circles
where
english
was
generally
spoken
if
not
understood
undine
herself
hampered
by
her
lack
of
languages
was
soon
drawn
into
the
group
of
compatriots
who
struck
the
social
pitch
of
their
hotel
their
types
were
familiar
enough
to
ralph
who
had
taken
their
measure
in
former
wanderings
and
come
across
their
duplicates
in
every
scene
of
continental
idleness
foremost
among
them
was
harvey
shallum
a
showy
parisianized
figure
with
a
small
husband
whose
clothes
seemed
a
tribute
to
his
wife
importance
rather
than
the
mark
of
his
personal
taste
shallum
in
fact
could
not
be
said
to
have
any
personal
bent
though
he
conversed
with
a
colourless
fluency
in
the
principal
european
tongues
he
seldom
exercised
his
gift
except
in
intercourse
with
and
and
his
long
silences
were
broken
only
by
resigned
allusions
to
the
enormities
he
had
suffered
at
the
hands
of
this
gifted
but
unscrupulous
class
shallum
though
in
command
of
but
a
few
verbs
all
of
which
on
her
lips
became
irregular
managed
to
express
a
polyglot
personality
as
vivid
as
her
husband
was
effaced
her
only
idea
of
intercourse
with
her
kind
was
to
organize
it
into
bands
and
subject
it
to
frequent
displacements
and
society
smiled
at
her
for
these
exertions
like
an
infant
vigorously
rocked
she
saw
at
once
undine
value
as
a
factor
in
her
scheme
and
the
two
formed
an
alliance
on
which
ralph
refrained
from
shedding
the
cold
light
of
depreciation
it
was
a
point
of
honour
with
him
not
to
seem
to
disdain
any
of
undine
amusements
the
noisy
interminable
picnics
the
hot
promiscuous
balls
the
concerts
and
theatricals
which
helped
to
disguise
the
difference
between
the
high
alps
and
paris
or
new
york
he
told
himself
that
there
is
always
a
in
youth
and
that
what
undine
really
enjoyed
was
the
image
of
her
own
charm
mirrored
in
the
general
admiration
with
her
quick
perceptions
and
adaptabilities
she
would
soon
learn
to
care
more
about
the
quality
of
the
reflecting
surface
and
meanwhile
no
criticism
of
his
should
mar
her
pleasure
the
appearance
at
their
hotel
of
the
from
siena
was
a
not
wholly
agreeable
surprise
but
even
after
the
handsome
marquis
had
been
introduced
to
undine
and
had
whirled
her
through
an
dances
ralph
was
not
seriously
disturbed
husband
and
wife
had
grown
closer
to
each
other
since
they
had
come
to
moritz
and
in
the
brief
moments
she
could
give
him
undine
was
now
always
gay
and
approachable
her
fitful
humours
had
vanished
and
she
showed
qualities
of
comradeship
that
seemed
the
promise
of
a
deeper
understanding
but
this
very
hope
made
him
more
subject
to
her
moods
more
fearful
of
disturbing
the
harmony
between
them
least
of
all
could
he
broach
the
subject
of
money
he
had
too
keen
a
memory
of
the
way
her
lips
could
narrow
and
her
eyes
turn
from
him
as
if
he
were
a
stranger
it
was
a
different
matter
that
one
day
brought
the
look
he
feared
to
her
face
she
had
announced
her
intention
of
going
on
an
excursion
with
shallum
and
three
or
four
of
the
young
men
who
formed
the
nucleus
of
their
shifting
circle
and
for
the
first
time
she
did
not
ask
ralph
if
he
were
coming
but
he
felt
no
resentment
at
being
left
out
he
was
tired
of
these
noisy
assaults
on
the
high
solitudes
and
the
prospect
of
a
quiet
afternoon
turned
his
thoughts
to
his
book
now
if
ever
there
seemed
a
chance
of
recapturing
the
moonlight
vision
from
his
balcony
he
looked
down
on
the
assembling
party
shallum
was
already
screaming
bilingually
at
various
windows
in
the
long
facade
and
undine
presently
came
out
of
the
hotel
with
the
marchese
roviano
and
two
young
english
diplomatists
slim
and
tall
in
her
trim
mountain
garb
she
made
the
ornate
shallum
look
like
a
piece
of
ambulant
upholstery
the
high
air
brightened
her
cheeks
and
struck
new
lights
from
her
hair
and
ralph
had
never
seen
her
so
touched
with
morning
freshness
the
party
was
not
yet
complete
and
he
felt
a
movement
of
annoyance
when
he
recognized
in
the
last
person
to
join
it
a
russian
lady
of
cosmopolitan
notoriety
whom
he
had
run
across
in
his
unmarried
days
and
as
to
whom
he
had
already
warned
undine
knowing
what
strange
specimens
from
the
depths
slip
through
the
wide
meshes
of
the
world
he
had
foreseen
that
a
meeting
with
the
baroness
adelschein
was
inevitable
but
he
had
not
expected
her
to
become
one
of
his
wife
intimate
circle
when
the
excursionists
had
started
he
turned
back
to
his
and
tried
to
take
up
his
work
but
he
could
not
fix
his
thoughts
they
were
far
away
in
pursuit
of
undine
he
had
been
but
five
months
married
and
it
seemed
after
all
rather
soon
for
him
to
be
dropped
out
of
such
excursions
as
unquestioningly
as
poor
harvey
shallum
he
smiled
away
this
first
twinge
of
jealousy
but
the
irritation
it
left
found
a
pretext
in
his
displeasure
at
undine
choice
of
companions
shallum
grated
on
his
taste
but
she
was
as
open
to
inspection
as
a
and
he
was
sure
that
time
would
teach
his
wife
the
cheapness
of
what
she
had
to
show
roviano
and
the
englishmen
were
well
enough
too
frankly
bent
on
amusement
but
pleasant
and
but
they
would
naturally
take
their
tone
from
the
women
they
were
with
and
madame
adelschein
tone
was
notorious
he
knew
also
that
faculty
of
was
weakened
by
the
instinct
of
adapting
herself
to
whatever
company
she
was
in
of
copying
the
others
in
speech
and
gesture
as
closely
as
she
reflected
them
in
dress
and
he
was
disturbed
by
the
thought
of
what
her
ignorance
might
expose
her
to
she
came
back
late
flushed
with
her
long
walk
her
face
all
sparkle
and
mystery
as
he
had
seen
it
in
the
first
days
of
their
courtship
and
the
look
somehow
revived
his
irritated
sense
of
having
been
intentionally
left
out
of
the
party
you
been
gone
forever
was
it
the
adelschein
who
made
you
go
such
lengths
he
asked
her
trying
to
keep
to
his
usual
joking
tone
undine
as
she
dropped
down
on
the
sofa
and
unpinned
her
hat
shed
on
him
the
light
of
her
guileless
gaze
i
do
know
everybody
was
amusing
the
marquis
is
awfully
bright
i
no
idea
you
or
bertha
shallum
knew
madame
adelschein
well
enough
to
take
her
off
with
you
in
that
way
undine
sat
absently
smoothing
the
tuft
of
glossy
in
her
hat
i
do
see
that
you
got
to
know
people
particularly
well
to
go
for
a
walk
with
them
the
baroness
is
awfully
bright
too
she
always
gave
her
acquaintances
their
titles
seeming
not
in
this
respect
to
have
noticed
that
a
simpler
form
prevailed
i
do
dispute
the
interest
of
what
she
says
but
i
told
you
what
decent
people
think
of
what
she
does
ralph
retorted
exasperated
by
what
seemed
a
wilful
pretense
of
ignorance
she
continued
to
scrutinize
him
with
her
clear
eyes
in
which
there
was
no
shadow
of
offense
you
mean
they
do
want
to
go
round
with
her
you
mistaken
not
true
she
goes
round
with
everybody
she
dined
last
night
with
the
grand
duchess
roviano
told
me
so
this
was
not
calculated
to
make
ralph
take
a
more
tolerant
view
of
the
question
does
he
also
tell
you
what
said
of
her
what
said
of
her
undine
limpid
glance
rebuked
him
do
you
mean
that
disgusting
scandal
you
told
me
about
do
you
suppose
i
let
him
talk
to
me
about
such
things
i
meant
you
mistaken
about
her
social
position
he
says
she
goes
everywhere
ralph
laughed
impatiently
no
doubt
roviano
an
authority
but
it
does
happen
to
be
his
business
to
choose
your
friends
for
you
undine
echoed
his
laugh
well
i
guess
i
do
need
anybody
to
do
that
i
can
do
it
myself
she
said
with
the
curtness
that
was
the
habitual
note
of
intercourse
with
the
spraggs
ralph
sat
down
beside
her
and
laid
a
caressing
touch
on
her
shoulder
no
you
ca
you
foolish
child
you
know
nothing
of
this
society
you
in
of
its
antecedents
its
rules
its
conventions
and
it
my
affair
to
look
after
you
and
warn
you
when
you
on
the
wrong
track
mercy
what
a
solemn
speech
she
shrugged
away
his
hand
without
i
do
believe
an
american
woman
needs
to
know
such
a
lot
about
their
old
rules
they
can
see
i
mean
to
follow
my
own
and
if
they
do
like
it
they
need
go
with
me
oh
they
go
with
you
fast
enough
as
you
call
it
they
be
too
charmed
to
the
question
is
how
far
they
make
you
go
with
them
and
where
they
finally
land
you
she
tossed
her
head
back
with
the
movement
she
had
learned
in
speaking
about
freedom
and
the
british
tyrant
no
one
ever
yet
gone
any
farther
with
me
than
i
wanted
she
declared
she
was
really
exquisitely
simple
i
not
sure
roviano
has
in
vouching
for
madame
adelschein
but
he
probably
thinks
you
know
about
her
to
him
this
is
any
more
than
the
people
in
an
omnibus
are
society
to
everybody
here
means
the
sanction
of
their
own
special
group
and
of
the
corresponding
groups
elsewhere
the
adelschein
goes
about
in
a
place
like
this
because
nobody
business
to
stop
her
but
the
women
who
tolerate
her
here
would
drop
her
like
a
shot
if
she
set
foot
on
their
own
ground
the
thoughtful
air
with
which
undine
heard
him
out
made
him
fancy
this
argument
had
carried
and
as
be
ended
she
threw
him
a
bright
look
well
that
easy
enough
i
can
drop
her
if
she
comes
to
new
york
ralph
sat
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
turned
away
and
began
to
gather
up
his
scattered
pages
undine
in
the
ensuing
days
was
no
less
often
with
madame
adelschein
and
ralph
suspected
a
challenge
in
her
open
frequentation
of
the
lady
but
if
challenge
there
were
he
let
it
lie
whether
his
wife
saw
more
or
less
of
madame
adelschein
seemed
no
longer
of
much
consequence
she
had
so
amply
shown
him
her
ability
to
protect
herself
the
pang
lay
in
the
completeness
of
the
proof
in
the
perfect
functioning
of
her
instinct
of
for
the
first
time
he
was
face
to
face
with
his
hovering
dread
he
was
judging
where
he
still
adored
before
long
more
pressing
cares
absorbed
him
he
had
already
begun
to
watch
the
post
for
his
monthly
remittance
without
precisely
knowing
how
even
with
its
aid
he
was
to
bridge
the
gulf
of
expense
between
moritz
and
new
york
the
of
cheque
was
productive
of
graver
tears
and
these
were
abruptly
confirmed
when
coming
in
one
afternoon
he
found
undine
crying
over
a
letter
from
her
mother
her
distress
made
him
fear
that
spragg
was
ill
and
he
drew
her
to
him
soothingly
but
she
broke
away
with
an
impatient
movement
oh
they
all
well
enough
but
father
lost
a
lot
of
money
been
speculating
and
he
ca
send
us
anything
for
at
least
three
months
ralph
murmured
reassuringly
as
long
as
there
no
one
ill
but
in
reality
he
was
following
her
despairing
gaze
down
the
long
perspective
of
their
barren
quarter
three
months
three
months
undine
dried
her
eyes
and
sat
with
set
lips
and
tapping
foot
while
he
read
her
mother
letter
your
poor
father
it
a
hard
knock
for
him
i
sorry
he
said
as
he
handed
it
back
for
a
moment
she
did
not
seem
to
hear
then
she
said
between
her
teeth
it
hard
for
us
i
suppose
now
we
have
to
go
straight
home
he
looked
at
her
with
wonder
if
that
were
all
in
any
case
i
should
have
to
be
back
in
a
few
weeks
but
we
need
have
left
here
in
august
it
the
first
place
in
europe
that
i
liked
and
it
just
my
luck
to
be
dragged
away
from
it
i
so
awfully
sorry
dearest
it
my
fault
for
persuading
you
to
marry
a
pauper
it
father
fault
why
on
earth
did
he
go
and
speculate
there
no
use
his
saying
he
sorry
now
she
sat
brooding
for
a
moment
and
then
suddenly
took
ralph
hand
could
your
people
do
something
help
us
out
just
this
once
i
mean
he
flushed
to
the
forehead
it
seemed
inconceivable
that
she
should
make
such
a
suggestion
i
could
ask
them
it
not
possible
my
grandfather
does
as
much
as
he
can
for
me
and
my
mother
has
nothing
but
what
he
gives
her
undine
seemed
unconscious
of
his
embarrassment
he
does
give
us
nearly
as
much
as
father
does
she
said
and
as
ralph
remained
silent
she
went
on
could
you
ask
your
sister
then
i
must
have
some
clothes
to
go
home
in
his
heart
contracted
as
he
looked
at
her
what
sinister
change
came
over
her
when
her
will
was
crossed
she
seemed
to
grow
inaccessible
implacable
her
eyes
were
like
the
eyes
of
an
enemy
i
do
know
i
see
he
said
rising
and
moving
away
from
her
at
that
moment
the
touch
of
her
hand
was
repugnant
yes
he
might
ask
laura
no
doubt
and
whatever
she
had
would
be
his
but
the
necessity
was
bitter
to
him
and
undine
unconsciousness
of
the
fact
hurt
him
more
than
her
indifference
to
her
father
misfortune
what
hurt
him
most
was
the
curious
fact
that
for
all
her
light
irresponsibility
it
was
always
she
who
made
the
practical
suggestion
hit
the
nail
of
expediency
on
the
head
no
sentimental
scruple
made
the
blow
waver
or
deflected
her
resolute
aim
she
had
thought
at
once
of
laura
and
laura
was
his
only
his
inevitable
resource
his
anxious
mind
pictured
his
sister
wonder
and
made
him
wince
under
the
sting
of
henley
fairford
irony
fairford
who
at
the
time
of
the
marriage
had
sat
silent
and
pulled
his
moustache
while
every
one
else
argued
and
objected
yet
under
whose
silence
ralph
had
felt
a
deeper
protest
than
under
all
the
reasoning
of
the
others
it
was
no
comfort
to
reflect
that
fairford
would
probably
continue
to
say
nothing
but
necessity
made
light
of
these
twinges
and
ralph
set
his
teeth
and
cabled
undine
chief
surprise
seemed
to
be
that
laura
response
though
immediate
and
generous
did
not
enable
them
to
stay
on
at
moritz
but
she
apparently
read
in
her
husband
look
the
uselessness
of
such
a
hope
for
with
one
of
the
sudden
changes
of
mood
that
still
disarmed
him
she
accepted
the
need
of
departure
and
took
leave
philosophically
of
the
shallums
and
their
band
after
all
paris
was
ahead
and
in
september
one
would
have
a
chance
to
see
the
new
models
and
surprise
the
secret
councils
of
the
dressmakers
ralph
was
astonished
at
the
tenacity
with
which
she
held
to
her
purpose
he
tried
when
they
reached
paris
to
make
her
feel
the
necessity
of
starting
at
once
for
home
but
she
complained
of
fatigue
and
of
feeling
vaguely
unwell
and
he
had
to
yield
to
her
desire
for
rest
the
word
however
was
to
strike
him
as
strangely
misapplied
for
from
the
day
of
their
arrival
she
was
in
state
of
perpetual
activity
she
seemed
to
have
mastered
her
paris
by
divination
and
between
the
hounds
of
the
boulevards
and
the
place
vendome
she
moved
at
once
with
supernatural
ease
of
course
she
explained
to
him
i
understand
how
little
we
got
to
spend
but
i
left
new
york
without
a
rag
and
it
was
you
who
made
me
countermand
my
trousseau
instead
of
having
it
sent
after
us
i
wish
now
i
had
listened
to
you
father
have
had
to
pay
for
that
before
he
lost
his
money
as
it
is
it
will
be
cheaper
in
the
end
for
me
to
pick
up
a
few
things
here
the
advantage
of
going
to
the
french
is
that
they
wait
twice
as
long
for
their
money
as
the
people
at
home
and
they
all
crazy
to
dress
me
bertha
shallum
will
tell
you
so
she
says
no
one
ever
had
such
a
chance
that
why
i
was
willing
to
come
to
this
stuffy
little
hotel
i
wanted
to
save
every
scrap
i
could
to
get
a
few
decent
things
and
over
here
they
accustomed
to
being
bargained
with
you
ought
to
see
how
i
beaten
them
down
have
you
any
idea
what
a
costs
in
new
york
so
it
went
on
obtusely
and
persistently
whenever
he
tried
to
sound
the
note
of
prudence
but
on
other
themes
she
was
more
than
usually
responsive
paris
enchanted
her
and
they
had
delightful
hours
at
the
theatres
the
little
ones
amusing
dinners
at
fashionable
restaurants
and
reckless
evenings
in
haunts
where
she
thrilled
with
simple
glee
at
the
thought
of
what
she
must
so
obviously
be
taken
for
all
these
familiar
diversions
regained
for
ralph
a
fresh
zest
in
her
company
her
innocence
her
high
spirits
her
astounding
comments
and
credulities
renovated
the
old
parisian
adventure
and
flung
a
veil
of
romance
over
its
hackneyed
scenes
beheld
through
such
a
medium
the
future
looked
less
near
and
implacable
and
ralph
when
he
had
received
a
reassuring
letter
from
his
sister
let
his
conscience
sleep
and
slipped
forth
on
the
high
tide
of
pleasure
after
all
in
new
york
amusements
would
be
fewer
and
their
life
for
a
time
perhaps
more
quiet
moreover
ralph
dim
glimpses
of
spragg
past
suggested
that
the
latter
was
likely
to
be
on
his
feet
again
at
any
moment
and
atoning
by
redoubled
prodigalities
for
his
temporary
straits
and
beyond
all
these
possibilities
there
was
the
book
to
be
written
the
book
on
which
ralph
was
sure
he
should
get
a
real
hold
as
soon
as
they
settled
down
in
new
york
meanwhile
the
daily
cost
of
living
and
the
bills
that
could
not
be
deferred
were
eating
deep
into
laura
subsidy
ralph
anxieties
returned
and
his
plight
was
brought
home
to
him
with
a
shock
when
on
going
one
day
to
engage
passages
he
learned
that
the
prices
were
that
of
the
rush
season
and
one
of
the
conditions
immediate
payment
at
other
times
he
was
told
the
rules
were
easier
but
in
september
and
october
no
exception
could
be
made
as
he
walked
away
with
this
fresh
weight
on
his
mind
he
caught
sight
of
the
strolling
figure
of
peter
van
degen
peter
lounging
and
luxuriating
among
the
seductions
of
the
boulevard
with
the
disgusting
ease
of
a
man
whose
wants
are
all
measured
by
money
and
who
always
has
enough
to
gratify
them
his
present
sense
of
these
advantages
revealed
itself
in
the
affability
of
his
greeting
to
ralph
and
in
his
request
that
the
latter
should
look
up
clare
who
had
come
over
with
him
to
get
her
winter
finery
she
motoring
to
italy
next
week
with
some
of
her
friends
but
i
off
for
the
other
side
going
back
on
the
sorceress
she
just
been
overhauled
at
greenock
and
we
ought
to
have
a
good
spin
over
better
come
along
with
me
old
man
the
sorceress
was
van
degen
most
huge
and
complicated
of
her
kind
it
was
his
habit
after
his
flights
to
paris
and
london
to
take
a
joyous
company
back
on
her
and
let
clare
return
by
steamer
the
character
of
these
parties
made
the
invitation
almost
an
offense
to
ralph
but
reflecting
that
it
was
probably
a
phrase
distributed
to
every
acquaintance
when
van
degen
was
in
a
rosy
mood
he
merely
answered
much
obliged
my
dear
fellow
but
undine
and
i
are
sailing
immediately
peter
glassy
eye
grew
livelier
ah
to
be
sure
you
not
over
the
honeymoon
yet
how
the
bride
stunning
as
ever
my
regards
to
her
please
i
suppose
she
too
deep
in
to
be
called
on
you
forget
to
look
up
clare
he
hurried
on
in
pursuit
of
a
flitting
petticoat
and
ralph
continued
his
walk
home
he
prolonged
it
a
little
in
order
to
put
off
telling
undine
of
his
plight
for
he
could
devise
only
one
way
of
meeting
the
cost
of
the
voyage
and
that
was
to
take
it
at
once
and
thus
curtail
their
parisian
expenses
but
he
knew
how
unwelcome
this
plan
would
be
and
he
shrank
the
more
from
seeing
undine
face
harden
since
of
late
he
had
so
basked
in
its
brightness
when
at
last
he
entered
the
little
salon
she
called
stuffy
he
found
her
in
conference
with
a
gentleman
who
wore
the
red
ribbon
in
his
lapel
and
who
on
ralph
appearance
and
at
a
sign
as
it
appeared
from
marvell
swept
into
his
some
small
objects
that
had
lain
on
the
table
and
bowed
himself
out
with
a
madame
monsieur
worthy
of
the
highest
traditions
ralph
looked
after
him
with
amusement
who
your
friend
an
ambassador
or
a
tailor
undine
was
rapidly
slipping
on
her
rings
which
as
he
now
saw
had
also
been
scattered
over
the
table
oh
it
was
only
that
jeweller
i
told
you
about
the
one
bertha
shallum
goes
to
a
jeweller
good
heavens
my
poor
girl
you
buying
jewels
the
extravagance
of
the
idea
struck
a
laugh
from
him
undine
face
did
not
harden
it
took
on
instead
almost
deprecating
look
of
course
not
how
silly
you
are
i
only
wanted
a
few
old
things
reset
but
i
wo
if
you
rather
not
she
came
to
him
and
sat
down
at
his
side
laying
her
hand
on
his
arm
he
took
the
hand
up
and
looked
at
the
deep
gleam
of
the
sapphires
in
the
old
family
ring
he
had
given
her
you
wo
have
that
reset
he
said
smiling
and
twisting
the
ring
about
on
her
finger
then
he
went
on
with
his
thankless
explanation
it
not
that
i
do
want
you
to
do
this
or
that
it
simply
that
for
the
moment
we
rather
strapped
i
just
been
to
see
the
steamer
people
and
our
passages
will
cost
a
good
deal
more
than
i
thought
he
mentioned
the
sum
and
the
fact
that
he
must
give
an
answer
the
next
day
would
she
consent
to
sail
that
very
saturday
or
should
they
go
a
fortnight
later
in
a
slow
boat
from
plymouth
undine
frowned
on
both
alternatives
she
was
an
indifferent
sailor
and
shrank
from
the
possible
nastiness
of
the
cheaper
boat
she
wanted
to
get
the
voyage
over
as
quickly
and
luxuriously
as
possible
bertha
shallum
had
told
her
that
in
a
no
one
need
be
but
she
wanted
still
more
to
have
another
week
or
two
of
paris
and
it
was
always
hard
to
make
her
see
why
circumstances
could
not
be
bent
to
her
wishes
this
week
but
how
on
earth
can
i
be
ready
besides
we
dining
at
enghien
with
the
shallums
on
saturday
and
motoring
to
chantilly
with
the
jim
driscolls
on
sunday
i
ca
imagine
how
you
thought
we
could
go
this
week
but
she
still
opposed
the
cheap
steamer
and
after
they
had
carried
the
question
on
to
voisin
and
there
unprofitably
discussed
it
through
a
long
luncheon
it
seemed
no
nearer
a
solution
well
think
it
over
let
me
know
this
evening
ralph
said
proportioning
the
waiter
fee
to
a
bill
burdened
by
undine
reckless
choice
of
primeurs
his
wife
was
to
join
the
shallum
in
a
round
of
the
rue
de
la
paix
and
he
had
seized
the
opportunity
of
slipping
off
to
a
classical
performance
at
the
français
on
their
arrival
in
paris
he
had
taken
undine
to
one
of
these
entertainments
but
it
left
her
too
weary
and
puzzled
for
him
to
renew
the
attempt
and
he
had
not
found
time
to
go
back
without
her
he
was
glad
now
to
shed
his
cares
in
such
an
atmosphere
the
play
was
of
the
greatest
the
interpretation
that
of
the
vanishing
grand
manner
which
lived
in
his
first
memories
of
the
parisian
stage
and
his
surrender
such
influences
as
complete
as
in
his
early
days
caught
up
in
the
fiery
chariot
of
art
he
felt
once
more
the
tug
of
its
coursers
in
his
muscles
and
the
rush
of
their
flight
still
throbbed
in
him
when
he
walked
back
late
to
the
hotel
xiii
he
had
expected
to
find
undine
still
out
but
on
the
stairs
he
crossed
shallum
who
threw
at
him
from
under
an
immense
yes
she
in
but
you
better
come
and
have
tea
with
me
at
the
luxe
i
do
think
husbands
are
wanted
ralph
laughingly
rejoined
that
that
was
just
the
moment
for
them
to
appear
and
shallum
swept
on
crying
back
all
the
same
i
wait
for
you
in
the
ralph
found
undine
seated
behind
a
on
the
other
side
of
which
in
an
attitude
of
easy
intimacy
peter
van
degen
stretched
his
lounging
length
he
did
not
move
on
ralph
appearance
no
doubt
thinking
their
kinship
close
enough
to
make
his
nod
and
hullo
a
sufficient
greeting
peter
in
intimacy
was
given
to
miscalculations
of
the
sort
and
ralph
first
movement
was
to
glance
at
undine
and
see
how
it
affected
her
but
her
eyes
gave
out
the
vivid
rays
that
noise
and
banter
always
struck
from
them
her
face
at
such
moments
was
like
a
theatre
with
all
the
lustres
blazing
that
the
illumination
should
have
been
kindled
by
his
husband
was
not
precisely
agreeable
to
marvell
who
thought
peter
a
bore
in
society
and
an
insufferable
nuisance
on
closer
terms
but
he
was
becoming
blunted
to
undine
lack
of
discrimination
and
his
own
treatment
of
van
degen
was
always
tempered
by
his
sympathy
for
clare
he
therefore
listened
with
apparent
to
peter
suggestion
of
an
evening
at
a
petit
theatre
with
the
harvey
shallums
and
joined
in
the
laugh
with
which
undine
declared
oh
ralph
wo
go
he
only
likes
the
theatres
where
they
walk
around
in
bathtowels
and
talk
is
that
what
you
just
been
seeing
she
added
with
a
turn
of
the
neck
that
shed
her
brightness
on
him
what
one
of
those
shows
at
the
français
great
scott
ralph
no
wonder
your
wife
pining
for
the
folies
bergère
she
need
my
dear
fellow
we
never
interfere
with
each
vices
peter
unsolicited
was
comfortably
lighting
a
cigarette
ah
the
secret
of
domestic
happiness
marry
somebody
who
likes
all
the
things
you
do
and
make
love
to
somebody
who
likes
all
the
things
you
do
undine
laughed
appreciatively
only
it
dooms
poor
ralph
to
such
awful
frumps
ca
you
see
the
sort
of
woman
who
love
his
sort
of
play
oh
i
can
see
her
fast
enough
my
wife
loves
said
their
visitor
rising
with
a
grin
while
ralph
threw
out
so
do
waste
your
pity
on
me
and
undine
laugh
had
the
slight
note
of
asperity
that
the
mention
of
clare
always
elicited
night
then
at
paillard
van
degen
concluded
and
about
the
other
business
that
a
go
too
i
leave
it
to
you
to
settle
the
date
the
nod
and
laugh
they
exchanged
seemed
to
hint
at
depths
of
collusion
from
which
ralph
was
pointedly
excluded
and
he
wondered
how
large
a
programme
of
pleasure
they
had
already
had
time
to
sketch
out
he
disliked
the
idea
of
undine
being
too
frequently
seen
with
van
degen
whose
parisian
reputation
was
not
fortified
by
the
connections
that
propped
it
up
in
new
york
but
he
did
not
want
to
interfere
with
her
pleasure
and
he
was
still
wondering
what
to
say
when
as
the
door
closed
she
turned
to
him
gaily
i
so
glad
you
come
i
got
some
news
for
you
she
laid
a
light
touch
on
his
arm
touch
and
tone
were
enough
to
disperse
his
anxieties
and
he
answered
that
he
was
in
luck
to
find
her
already
in
when
he
had
supposed
her
engaged
over
a
nouveau
luxe
in
repairing
the
ravages
oh
i
did
shop
much
i
did
stay
out
long
she
raised
a
kindling
face
to
him
and
what
do
you
think
i
been
doing
while
you
were
sitting
in
your
stuffy
old
theatre
worrying
about
the
money
i
was
spending
oh
you
need
fib
i
know
you
were
i
was
saving
you
hundreds
and
thousands
i
saved
you
the
price
of
our
passage
ralph
laughed
in
pure
enjoyment
of
her
beauty
when
she
shone
on
him
like
that
what
did
it
matter
what
nonsense
she
talked
you
wonderful
woman
how
did
you
do
it
by
countermanding
a
tiara
you
know
i
not
such
a
fool
as
you
pretend
she
held
him
at
length
with
a
nod
of
joyous
mystery
you
simply
never
guess
made
peter
van
degen
ask
us
to
go
home
on
the
sorceress
what
do
you
say
to
that
she
flashed
it
out
on
a
laugh
of
triumph
without
appearing
to
have
a
doubt
of
the
effect
the
announcement
would
produce
ralph
stared
at
her
the
sorceress
you
made
him
well
i
managed
it
i
worked
him
round
to
it
he
crazy
about
the
idea
now
but
i
do
think
he
thought
of
it
before
he
came
i
should
say
not
ralph
ejaculated
he
never
would
have
had
the
cheek
to
think
of
it
well
i
made
him
anyhow
did
you
ever
know
such
luck
such
luck
he
groaned
at
her
obstinate
innocence
do
you
suppose
let
you
cross
the
ocean
on
the
sorceress
she
shrugged
impatiently
you
say
that
because
your
cousin
does
go
on
her
if
she
does
it
because
it
no
place
for
decent
women
it
clare
fault
if
it
is
everybody
knows
she
crazy
about
you
and
she
makes
him
feel
it
that
why
he
takes
up
with
other
women
her
anger
reddened
her
cheeks
and
dropped
her
brows
like
a
black
bar
above
her
glowing
eyes
even
in
his
recoil
from
what
she
said
ralph
felt
the
tempestuous
heat
of
her
beauty
but
for
the
first
time
his
latent
resentments
rose
in
him
and
he
gave
her
back
wrath
for
wrath
is
that
the
precious
stuff
he
tells
you
do
you
suppose
i
had
to
wait
for
him
to
tell
me
everybody
knows
it
everybody
in
new
york
knew
she
was
wild
when
you
married
why
she
always
been
so
nasty
to
me
if
you
wo
go
on
the
sorceress
they
all
say
it
because
she
was
jealous
of
me
and
would
let
you
ralph
indignation
had
already
flickered
down
to
disgust
undine
was
no
longer
beautiful
she
seemed
to
have
the
face
of
her
thoughts
he
stood
up
with
an
impatient
laugh
is
that
another
of
his
arguments
i
do
wonder
they
convincing
but
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
the
sneer
dropped
yielding
to
a
wave
of
pity
the
vague
impulse
to
silence
and
protect
her
how
could
he
have
given
way
to
the
provocation
of
her
weakness
when
his
business
was
to
defend
her
from
it
and
lift
her
above
it
he
recalled
his
old
dreams
of
saving
her
from
van
degenism
it
was
not
thus
that
he
had
imagined
the
rescue
do
let
pay
peter
the
compliment
of
squabbling
over
him
he
said
turning
away
to
pour
himself
a
cup
of
tea
when
he
had
filled
his
cup
he
sat
down
beside
undine
with
a
smile
no
doubt
he
was
joking
and
thought
you
were
but
if
you
really
made
him
believe
we
might
go
with
him
you
better
drop
him
a
line
undine
brow
still
gloomed
you
refuse
then
refuse
i
do
need
to
do
you
want
to
succeed
to
half
the
of
new
york
they
wo
be
on
board
with
us
i
suppose
the
echoes
of
their
conversation
will
it
the
only
language
peter
knows
he
told
me
he
longed
for
the
influence
of
a
good
woman
she
checked
herself
reddening
at
ralph
laugh
well
tell
him
to
apply
again
when
he
been
under
it
a
month
or
two
meanwhile
we
stick
to
the
liners
ralph
was
beginning
to
learn
that
the
only
road
to
her
reason
lay
through
her
vanity
and
he
fancied
that
if
she
could
be
made
to
see
van
degen
as
an
object
of
ridicule
she
might
give
up
the
idea
of
the
sorceress
of
her
own
accord
but
her
will
hardened
slowly
under
his
joking
opposition
and
she
became
no
less
formidable
as
she
grew
more
calm
he
was
used
to
women
who
in
such
cases
yielded
as
a
matter
of
course
to
masculine
judgments
if
one
pronounced
a
man
not
decent
the
question
was
closed
but
it
was
undine
habit
to
ascribe
all
interference
with
her
plans
to
personal
motives
and
he
could
see
that
she
attributed
his
opposition
to
the
furtive
machinations
of
poor
clare
it
was
odious
to
him
to
prolong
the
discussion
for
the
accent
of
recrimination
was
the
one
he
most
dreaded
on
her
lips
but
the
moment
came
when
he
had
to
take
the
brunt
of
it
averting
his
thoughts
as
best
he
might
from
the
glimpse
it
gave
of
a
world
of
mean
familiarities
of
reprisals
drawn
from
the
vulgarest
of
vocabularies
certain
retorts
sped
through
the
air
like
the
flight
of
household
utensils
certain
charges
rang
out
like
accusations
of
tampering
with
the
groceries
he
stiffened
himself
against
such
comparisons
but
they
stuck
in
his
imagination
and
left
him
thankful
when
undine
anger
yielded
to
a
burst
of
tears
he
had
held
his
own
and
gained
his
point
the
trip
on
the
sorceress
was
given
up
and
a
note
of
withdrawal
despatched
to
van
degen
but
at
the
same
time
ralph
cabled
his
sister
to
ask
if
she
could
increase
her
loan
for
he
had
conquered
only
at
the
cost
of
a
concession
undine
was
to
stay
in
paris
till
october
and
they
were
to
sail
on
a
fast
steamer
in
a
like
the
harvey
shallums
undine
was
soon
dispelled
by
any
new
distraction
and
she
gave
herself
to
the
untroubled
enjoyment
of
paris
the
shallums
were
the
centre
of
a
group
and
in
the
hours
the
ladies
could
spare
from
their
the
restaurants
shook
with
their
hilarity
and
the
suburbs
with
the
shriek
of
their
motors
van
degen
who
had
postponed
his
sailing
was
a
frequent
sharer
in
these
amusements
but
ralph
counted
on
new
york
influences
to
detach
him
from
undine
train
he
was
learning
to
influence
her
through
her
social
instincts
where
he
had
once
tried
to
appeal
to
other
sensibilities
his
worst
moment
came
when
he
went
to
see
clare
van
degen
who
on
the
eve
of
departure
had
begged
him
to
come
to
her
hotel
he
found
her
less
restless
and
rattling
than
usual
with
a
look
in
her
eyes
that
reminded
him
of
the
days
when
she
had
haunted
his
thoughts
the
visit
passed
off
without
vain
returns
to
the
past
but
as
he
was
leaving
she
surprised
him
by
saying
do
let
peter
make
a
goose
of
your
wife
ralph
reddened
but
laughed
oh
undine
wonderfully
able
to
defend
herself
even
against
such
seductions
as
peter
van
degen
looked
down
with
a
smile
at
the
bracelets
on
her
thin
brown
wrist
his
personal
seductions
yes
but
as
an
inventor
of
amusements
he
inexhaustible
and
undine
likes
to
be
amused
ralph
made
no
reply
but
showed
no
annoyance
he
simply
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
as
he
said
and
she
turned
from
him
without
audible
farewell
as
the
day
of
departure
approached
undine
absorption
in
her
dresses
almost
precluded
the
thought
of
amusement
early
and
late
she
was
closeted
with
fitters
and
packers
even
the
competent
celeste
not
being
trusted
to
handle
the
treasures
now
pouring
in
and
ralph
cursed
his
weakness
in
not
restraining
her
and
then
fled
for
solace
to
museums
and
galleries
he
could
not
rouse
in
her
any
scruple
about
incurring
fresh
debts
yet
he
knew
she
was
no
longer
unaware
of
the
value
of
money
she
had
learned
to
bargain
pare
down
prices
evade
fees
the
small
tradespeople
and
wheedle
concessions
from
the
great
not
as
ralph
perceived
from
any
effort
to
restrain
her
expenses
but
only
to
prolong
and
intensify
the
pleasure
of
spending
pained
by
the
trait
he
tried
to
laugh
her
out
of
it
he
told
her
once
that
she
had
a
miserly
hand
showing
her
in
proof
that
for
all
their
softness
the
fingers
would
not
bend
back
or
the
pink
palm
open
but
she
retorted
a
little
sharply
that
it
was
no
wonder
since
she
heard
nothing
talked
of
since
their
marriage
but
economy
and
this
left
him
without
any
answer
so
the
purveyors
continued
to
mount
to
their
apartment
and
ralph
in
the
course
of
his
frequent
nights
from
it
found
himself
always
dodging
the
corners
of
black
glazed
boxes
and
swaying
pyramids
of
pasteboard
always
lifting
his
hat
to
sidling
milliners
girls
or
effacing
himself
before
slender
vendeuses
floating
by
in
a
mist
of
opopanax
he
felt
incompetent
to
pronounce
on
the
needs
to
which
these
visitors
ministered
but
the
reappearance
among
them
of
the
jeweller
gave
him
ground
for
fresh
fears
undine
had
assured
him
that
she
had
given
up
the
idea
of
having
her
ornaments
reset
and
there
had
been
ample
time
for
their
return
but
on
his
questioning
her
she
explained
that
there
had
been
delays
and
bothers
and
put
him
in
the
wrong
by
asking
ironically
if
he
supposed
she
was
buying
things
for
pleasure
when
she
knew
as
well
as
he
that
there
was
any
money
to
pay
for
them
but
his
thoughts
were
not
all
dark
undine
moods
still
infected
him
and
when
she
was
happy
he
felt
an
answering
lightness
even
when
her
amusements
were
too
primitive
to
be
shared
he
could
enjoy
their
reflection
in
her
face
only
as
he
looked
back
he
was
struck
by
the
evanescence
the
lack
of
substance
in
their
moments
of
sympathy
and
by
the
permanent
marks
left
by
each
breach
between
them
yet
he
still
fancied
that
some
day
the
balance
might
be
reversed
and
that
as
she
acquired
a
finer
sense
of
values
the
depths
in
her
would
find
a
voice
something
of
this
was
in
his
mind
when
the
afternoon
before
their
departure
he
came
home
to
help
her
with
their
last
arrangements
she
had
begged
him
for
the
day
to
leave
her
alone
in
their
cramped
salon
into
which
belated
bundles
were
still
pouring
and
it
was
nearly
dark
when
he
returned
the
evening
before
she
had
seemed
pale
and
nervous
and
at
the
last
moment
had
excused
herself
from
dining
with
the
shallums
at
a
suburban
restaurant
it
was
so
unlike
her
to
miss
any
opportunity
of
the
kind
that
ralph
had
felt
a
little
anxious
but
with
the
arrival
of
the
packers
she
was
afoot
and
in
command
again
and
he
withdrew
submissively
as
spragg
in
the
early
apex
days
might
have
fled
from
the
spring
storm
of
when
he
entered
the
he
found
it
still
in
disorder
every
chair
was
hidden
under
scattered
dresses
surged
from
the
yawning
trunks
and
prone
among
her
finery
undine
lay
with
closed
eyes
on
the
sofa
she
raised
her
head
as
he
entered
and
then
turned
listlessly
away
my
poor
girl
what
the
matter
have
they
finished
yet
instead
of
answering
she
pressed
her
face
into
the
cushion
and
began
to
sob
the
violence
of
her
weeping
shook
her
hair
down
on
her
shoulders
and
her
hands
clenching
the
arm
of
the
sofa
pressed
it
away
from
her
as
if
any
contact
were
insufferable
ralph
bent
over
her
in
alarm
why
what
wrong
dear
happened
her
fatigue
of
the
previous
evening
came
back
to
him
a
puzzled
hunted
look
in
her
eyes
and
with
the
memory
a
vague
wonder
revived
he
had
fancied
himself
fairly
disencumbered
of
the
stock
formulas
about
the
hallowing
effects
of
motherhood
and
there
were
many
reasons
for
not
welcoming
the
news
he
suspected
she
had
to
give
but
the
woman
a
man
loves
is
always
a
special
case
and
everything
was
different
that
befell
undine
if
this
was
what
had
befallen
her
it
was
wonderful
and
divine
for
the
moment
that
was
all
he
felt
dear
tell
me
what
the
matter
he
pleaded
she
sobbed
on
unheedingly
and
he
waited
for
her
agitation
to
subside
he
shrank
from
the
phrases
considered
appropriate
to
the
situation
but
he
wanted
to
hold
her
close
and
give
her
the
depth
of
his
heart
in
long
kiss
suddenly
she
sat
upright
and
turned
a
desperate
face
on
him
why
on
earth
are
you
staring
at
me
like
that
anybody
can
see
what
the
matter
he
winced
at
her
tone
but
managed
to
get
one
of
her
hands
in
his
and
they
stayed
thus
in
silence
eye
to
eye
are
you
as
sorry
as
all
that
he
began
at
length
conscious
of
the
flatness
of
his
voice
sorry
sorry
i
i
she
snatched
her
hand
away
and
went
on
weeping
but
undine
dearest
bye
and
bye
you
feel
differently
i
know
you
will
differently
differently
when
in
a
year
it
takes
a
year
a
whole
year
out
of
life
what
do
i
care
how
i
shall
feel
in
a
year
the
chill
of
her
tone
struck
in
this
was
more
than
a
revolt
of
the
nerves
it
was
a
settled
a
reasoned
resentment
ralph
found
himself
groping
for
extenuations
evasions
anything
to
put
a
little
warmth
into
her
who
knows
perhaps
after
all
it
a
mistake
there
was
no
answering
light
in
her
face
she
turned
her
head
from
him
wearily
do
you
think
dear
you
may
be
mistaken
mistaken
how
on
earth
can
i
be
mistaken
even
in
that
moment
of
confusion
he
was
struck
by
the
cold
competence
of
her
tone
and
wondered
how
she
could
be
so
sure
you
mean
you
asked
you
consulted
the
irony
of
it
took
him
by
the
throat
they
were
the
very
words
he
might
have
spoken
in
some
miserable
secret
colloquy
the
words
he
was
speaking
to
his
wife
she
repeated
dully
i
know
i
not
mistaken
there
was
another
long
silence
undine
lay
still
her
eyes
shut
drumming
on
the
arm
of
the
sofa
with
a
restless
hand
the
other
lay
cold
in
ralph
clasp
and
through
it
there
gradually
stole
to
him
the
benumbing
influence
of
the
thoughts
she
was
thinking
the
sense
of
the
approach
of
illness
anxiety
and
expense
and
of
the
general
unnecessary
disorganization
of
their
lives
that
all
you
feel
then
he
asked
at
length
a
little
bitterly
as
if
to
disguise
from
himself
the
hateful
fact
that
he
felt
it
too
he
stood
up
and
moved
away
that
all
he
repeated
why
what
else
do
you
expect
me
to
feel
i
feel
horribly
ill
if
what
you
want
he
saw
the
sobs
trembling
up
through
her
again
poor
dear
poor
girl
i
so
sorry
so
dreadfully
sorry
the
senseless
reiteration
seemed
to
exasperate
her
he
knew
it
by
the
quiver
that
ran
through
her
like
the
premonitory
ripple
on
smooth
water
before
the
coming
of
the
wind
she
turned
about
on
him
and
jumped
to
her
feet
sorry
you
sorry
you
sorry
why
what
earthly
difference
will
it
make
to
you
she
drew
back
a
few
steps
and
lifted
her
slender
arms
from
her
sides
look
at
me
see
how
i
look
how
i
going
to
look
you
wo
hate
yourself
more
and
more
every
morning
when
you
get
up
and
see
yourself
in
the
glass
your
life
going
on
just
as
usual
but
mine
going
to
be
for
months
and
months
and
just
as
i
been
to
all
this
bother
fagging
myself
to
death
about
all
these
things
her
tragic
gesture
swept
the
disordered
room
just
as
i
thought
i
was
going
home
to
enjoy
myself
and
look
nice
and
see
people
again
and
have
a
little
pleasure
after
all
our
worries
she
dropped
back
on
the
sofa
with
another
burst
of
tears
for
all
the
good
this
rubbish
will
do
me
now
i
loathe
the
very
sight
of
it
she
sobbed
with
her
face
in
her
hands
xiv
it
was
one
of
the
distinctions
of
claud
walsingham
popple
that
his
studio
was
never
too
much
encumbered
with
the
attributes
of
his
art
to
permit
the
installing
in
one
of
its
cushioned
corners
of
an
elaborately
furnished
flanked
by
the
most
varied
seductions
in
sandwiches
and
pastry
popple
like
all
great
men
had
at
first
had
his
ups
and
downs
but
his
reputation
had
been
permanently
established
by
the
verdict
of
a
wealthy
patron
who
returning
from
an
excursion
into
other
fields
of
portraiture
had
given
it
as
the
final
fruit
of
his
experience
that
popple
was
the
only
man
who
could
do
pearls
to
sitters
for
whom
this
was
of
the
first
consequence
it
was
another
of
the
artist
merits
that
he
always
subordinated
art
to
elegance
in
life
as
well
as
in
his
portraits
the
messy
element
of
production
was
no
more
visible
in
his
expensively
screened
and
tapestried
studio
than
its
results
were
perceptible
in
his
painting
and
it
was
often
said
in
praise
of
his
work
that
he
was
the
only
artist
who
kept
his
studio
tidy
enough
for
a
lady
to
sit
to
him
in
a
new
dress
popple
in
fact
held
that
the
personality
of
the
artist
should
at
all
times
be
dissembled
behind
that
of
the
man
it
was
his
opinion
that
the
essence
of
lay
in
tossing
off
a
picture
as
easily
as
you
lit
a
cigarette
ralph
marvell
had
once
said
of
him
that
when
he
began
a
portrait
he
always
turned
back
his
cuffs
and
said
ladies
and
gentlemen
you
can
see
there
absolutely
nothing
here
and
fairford
supplemented
the
description
by
defining
his
painting
as
art
on
a
certain
late
afternoon
of
december
some
four
years
after
popple
first
meeting
with
miss
undine
spragg
of
apex
even
the
symbolic
was
nowhere
visible
in
his
studio
the
only
evidence
of
its
recent
activity
being
the
portrait
of
ralph
marvell
who
from
her
lofty
easel
and
her
heavily
garlanded
frame
faced
the
doorway
with
the
air
of
having
been
invited
to
receive
for
popple
the
artist
himself
becomingly
clad
in
velveteen
had
just
turned
away
from
the
picture
to
hover
above
the
but
his
place
had
been
taken
by
the
considerably
broader
bulk
of
peter
van
degen
who
tightly
moulded
into
a
coat
of
the
latest
cut
stood
before
the
portrait
in
the
attitude
of
a
first
arrival
yes
it
good
it
damn
good
popp
you
hit
the
hair
off
ripplingly
but
the
pearls
ai
big
enough
he
pronounced
a
slight
laugh
sounded
from
the
raised
dais
behind
the
easel
of
course
they
not
but
it
not
his
fault
poor
man
he
did
give
them
to
me
as
she
spoke
ralph
marvell
rose
from
a
monumental
gilt
of
design
and
swept
her
long
draperies
to
van
degen
side
he
might
then
for
the
privilege
of
painting
you
the
latter
rejoined
transferring
his
bulging
stare
from
the
counterfeit
to
the
original
his
eyes
rested
on
marvell
in
what
seemed
a
quick
exchange
of
understanding
then
they
passed
on
to
a
critical
inspection
of
her
person
she
was
dressed
for
the
sitting
in
something
faint
and
shining
above
which
the
long
curves
of
her
neck
looked
dead
white
in
the
cold
light
of
the
studio
and
her
hair
all
a
shadowless
rosy
gold
was
starred
with
a
hard
glitter
of
diamonds
the
privilege
of
painting
me
mercy
have
to
pay
for
being
painted
he
tell
you
he
giving
me
the
picture
but
what
do
you
suppose
this
cost
she
laid
a
on
her
shimmering
dress
van
degen
eye
rested
on
her
with
cold
enjoyment
does
the
price
come
higher
than
the
dress
she
ignored
the
allusion
of
course
what
they
charge
for
is
the
cut
what
they
cut
away
that
what
they
ought
to
charge
for
ai
it
popp
undine
took
this
with
cool
disdain
but
popple
sensibilities
were
offended
my
dear
peter
really
the
artist
you
understand
sees
all
this
as
a
pure
question
of
colour
of
pattern
and
it
a
point
of
honour
with
the
man
to
steel
himself
against
the
personal
seduction
van
degen
received
this
protest
with
a
sound
of
almost
vulgar
derision
but
undine
thrilled
agreeably
under
the
glance
which
her
portrayer
cast
on
her
she
was
flattered
by
van
degen
notice
and
thought
his
impertinence
witty
but
she
glowed
inwardly
at
eloquence
after
more
than
three
years
of
social
experience
she
still
thought
he
spoke
beautifully
like
the
hero
of
a
novel
and
she
ascribed
to
jealousy
the
lack
of
seriousness
with
which
her
friends
regarded
him
his
conversation
struck
her
as
intellectual
and
his
eagerness
to
have
her
share
his
thoughts
was
in
flattering
contrast
to
ralph
growing
tendency
to
keep
his
to
himself
popple
homage
seemed
the
subtlest
proof
of
what
ralph
could
have
made
of
her
if
he
had
really
understood
her
it
was
but
another
step
to
ascribe
all
her
past
mistakes
to
the
lack
of
such
understanding
and
the
satisfaction
derived
from
this
thought
had
once
impelled
her
to
tell
the
artist
that
he
alone
knew
how
to
rouse
her
self
he
had
assured
her
that
the
memory
of
her
words
would
thereafter
hallow
his
life
and
as
he
hinted
that
it
had
been
stained
by
the
darkest
errors
she
was
moved
at
the
thought
of
the
purifying
influence
she
exerted
thus
it
was
that
a
man
should
talk
to
a
true
woman
but
how
few
whom
she
had
known
possessed
the
secret
ralph
in
the
first
months
of
their
marriage
had
been
eloquent
too
had
even
gone
the
length
of
quoting
poetry
but
he
disconcerted
her
by
his
baffling
twists
and
strange
allusions
she
always
scented
ridicule
in
the
unknown
and
the
poets
he
quoted
were
esoteric
and
abstruse
popple
rhetoric
was
drawn
from
more
familiar
sources
and
abounded
in
favourite
phrases
and
in
moving
reminiscences
of
the
fifth
reader
he
was
moreover
as
literary
as
he
was
artistic
possessing
an
unequalled
acquaintance
with
contemporary
fiction
and
dipping
even
into
the
lighter
type
of
memoirs
in
which
the
old
acquaintances
of
history
are
served
up
in
the
disguise
of
a
royal
sorceress
or
passion
in
a
palace
the
mastery
with
which
popple
discussed
the
novel
of
the
day
especially
in
relation
to
the
sensibilities
of
its
hero
and
heroine
gave
undine
a
sense
of
intellectual
activity
which
contrasted
strikingly
with
flippant
estimate
of
such
works
passion
the
artist
implied
would
have
been
the
dominant
note
of
his
life
had
it
not
been
held
in
check
by
a
sentiment
of
exalted
chivalry
and
by
the
sense
that
a
nature
of
such
emotional
intensity
as
his
must
always
be
ridden
on
the
curb
van
degen
was
helping
himself
from
the
tray
of
iced
cocktails
which
stood
near
the
and
popple
turning
to
undine
took
up
the
thread
of
his
discourse
but
why
he
asked
why
allude
before
others
to
feelings
so
few
could
understand
the
average
man
lucky
devil
with
a
compassionate
glance
at
van
degen
back
the
average
man
knew
nothing
of
the
fierce
conflict
between
the
lower
and
higher
natures
and
even
the
woman
whose
eyes
had
kindled
it
how
much
did
she
guess
of
its
violence
did
she
know
popple
recklessly
asked
how
often
the
artist
was
forgotten
in
the
man
how
often
the
man
would
take
the
bit
between
his
teeth
were
it
not
that
the
look
in
her
eyes
recalled
some
sacred
memory
some
lesson
learned
perhaps
beside
his
mother
knee
i
say
popp
was
that
where
you
learned
to
mix
this
drink
because
it
does
the
old
lady
credit
van
degen
called
out
smacking
his
lips
while
the
artist
dashing
a
nervous
hand
through
his
hair
muttered
hang
it
peter
is
nothing
sacred
to
you
it
pleased
undine
to
feel
herself
capable
of
inspiring
such
emotions
she
would
have
been
fatigued
by
the
necessity
of
maintaining
her
own
talk
on
popple
level
but
she
liked
to
listen
to
him
and
especially
to
have
others
overhear
what
he
said
to
her
her
feeling
for
van
degen
was
different
there
was
more
similarity
of
tastes
between
them
though
his
manner
flattered
her
vanity
less
than
popple
she
felt
the
strength
of
van
degen
contempt
for
everything
he
did
not
understand
or
could
not
buy
that
was
the
only
kind
of
exclusiveness
that
impressed
her
and
he
was
still
to
her
as
in
her
inexperienced
days
the
master
of
the
mundane
science
she
had
once
imagined
that
ralph
marvell
possessed
during
the
three
years
since
her
marriage
she
had
learned
to
make
distinctions
unknown
to
her
girlish
categories
she
had
found
out
that
she
had
given
herself
to
the
exclusive
and
the
dowdy
when
the
future
belonged
to
the
showy
and
the
promiscuous
that
she
was
in
the
case
of
those
who
have
cast
in
their
lot
with
a
fallen
cause
or
to
use
an
analogy
more
within
her
range
who
have
hired
an
opera
box
on
the
wrong
night
it
was
all
confusing
and
exasperating
apex
ideals
had
been
based
on
the
myth
of
old
families
ruling
new
york
from
a
throne
of
revolutionary
tradition
with
the
new
millionaires
paying
them
feudal
allegiance
but
experience
had
long
since
proved
the
delusiveness
of
the
simile
classification
of
the
world
into
the
visited
and
the
unvisited
was
as
obsolete
as
a
mediaeval
cosmogony
some
of
those
whom
washington
square
left
unvisited
were
the
centre
of
social
systems
far
outside
its
ken
and
as
indifferent
to
its
opinions
as
the
constellations
to
the
reckonings
of
the
astronomers
and
all
these
systems
joyously
revolved
about
their
central
sun
of
gold
there
were
moments
after
undine
return
to
new
york
when
she
was
tempted
to
class
her
marriage
with
the
hateful
early
mistakes
from
the
memories
of
which
she
had
hoped
it
would
free
her
since
it
was
never
her
habit
to
accuse
herself
of
such
mistakes
it
was
inevitable
that
she
should
gradually
come
to
lay
the
blame
on
ralph
she
found
a
poignant
pleasure
at
this
stage
of
her
career
in
the
question
what
does
a
young
girl
know
of
life
and
the
poignancy
was
deepened
by
the
fact
that
each
of
the
friends
to
whom
she
put
the
question
seemed
convinced
that
had
the
privilege
been
his
he
would
have
known
how
to
spare
her
the
disenchantment
it
implied
the
conviction
of
having
blundered
was
never
more
present
to
her
than
when
on
this
particular
afternoon
the
guests
invited
by
popple
to
view
her
portrait
began
to
assemble
before
it
some
of
the
principal
figures
of
undine
group
had
rallied
for
the
occasion
and
almost
all
were
in
exasperating
enjoyment
of
the
privileges
for
which
she
pined
there
was
young
jim
driscoll
of
the
house
with
his
short
stout
mistrustful
wife
who
hated
society
but
went
everywhere
lest
it
might
be
thought
she
had
been
left
out
the
beautiful
beringer
a
lovely
aimless
being
who
kept
as
laura
fairford
said
a
home
for
stray
opinions
and
could
never
quite
tell
them
apart
little
dicky
bowles
whom
every
one
invited
because
he
was
understood
to
say
things
if
one
did
the
harvey
shallums
fresh
from
paris
and
dragging
in
their
wake
a
bewildered
nobleman
vaguely
designated
as
the
count
who
offered
cautious
conversational
openings
like
an
explorer
trying
beads
on
savages
and
behind
these
more
salient
types
the
usual
filling
in
of
those
who
are
seen
everywhere
because
they
have
learned
to
catch
the
social
eye
such
a
company
was
one
to
flatter
the
artist
as
much
his
sitter
so
completely
did
it
represent
that
unamity
of
opinion
which
constitutes
social
strength
not
one
the
number
was
troubled
by
any
personal
theory
of
art
all
they
asked
of
a
portrait
was
that
the
costume
should
be
sufficiently
and
the
face
not
too
much
so
and
a
long
experience
in
idealizing
flesh
and
realizing
had
enabled
popple
to
meet
both
demands
hang
it
peter
van
degen
pronounced
standing
before
the
easel
in
an
attitude
of
inspired
interpretation
the
great
thing
in
a
portrait
is
to
catch
the
likeness
we
all
know
that
but
with
a
it
different
a
woman
picture
has
got
to
be
pleasing
who
wants
it
about
if
it
is
those
big
chaps
who
blow
about
what
they
call
realism
how
do
their
portraits
look
in
a
do
you
suppose
they
ever
ask
themselves
that
they
do
care
they
not
going
to
live
with
the
things
and
what
do
they
know
of
anyhow
lots
of
them
have
even
got
a
there
where
old
popp
has
the
pull
over
he
knows
how
we
live
and
what
we
want
this
was
received
by
the
artist
with
a
deprecating
murmur
and
by
his
public
with
warm
expressions
of
approval
happily
in
this
case
popple
began
as
in
that
of
so
many
of
my
sitters
he
hastily
put
in
there
has
been
no
need
to
herself
has
outdone
the
artist
dream
undine
radiantly
challenging
comparison
with
her
portrait
glanced
up
at
it
with
a
smile
of
conscious
merit
which
deepened
as
young
jim
driscoll
declared
by
jove
mamie
you
must
be
done
exactly
like
that
for
the
new
his
wife
turned
a
cautious
eye
upon
the
picture
how
big
is
it
for
our
house
it
would
have
to
be
a
good
deal
bigger
she
objected
and
popple
fired
by
the
thought
of
such
a
dimensional
opportunity
rejoined
that
it
would
be
the
chance
of
all
others
to
work
in
a
marble
portico
and
a
he
had
just
done
lycurgus
ambler
in
a
and
feathers
and
as
that
was
for
buffalo
of
course
the
pictures
need
clash
well
it
would
have
to
be
a
good
deal
bigger
than
ambler
driscoll
insisted
and
on
popple
suggestion
that
in
that
case
he
might
work
in
driscoll
in
also
you
been
presented
well
you
will
be
you
have
to
if
i
do
the
picture
which
will
make
a
lovely
memento
van
degen
turned
aside
to
murmur
to
undine
pure
bluff
you
know
jim
could
pay
for
a
photograph
old
driscoll
high
and
dry
since
the
ararat
investigation
she
threw
him
a
puzzled
glance
having
no
time
in
her
crowded
existence
to
follow
the
perturbations
of
wall
street
save
as
they
affected
the
hospitality
of
fifth
avenue
you
mean
they
lost
their
money
wo
they
give
their
fancy
ball
then
van
degen
shrugged
nobody
knows
how
it
coming
out
that
queer
chap
elmer
moffatt
threatens
to
give
old
driscoll
a
fancy
ball
says
going
to
dress
him
in
stripes
it
seems
he
knows
too
much
about
the
apex
undine
paled
a
little
though
she
had
already
tried
on
her
costume
for
the
driscoll
ball
her
disappointment
at
van
degen
announcement
was
effaced
by
the
mention
of
moffatt
name
she
had
not
had
the
curiosity
to
follow
the
reports
of
the
ararat
trust
investigation
but
once
or
twice
lately
in
the
snatches
of
talk
she
had
been
surprised
by
a
vague
allusion
to
elmer
moffatt
as
to
an
erratic
financial
influence
half
ridiculed
yet
already
half
redoubtable
was
it
possible
that
the
redoubtable
element
had
prevailed
that
the
time
had
come
when
elmer
moffatt
the
elmer
moffatt
of
apex
could
even
for
a
moment
cause
consternation
in
the
driscoll
camp
he
had
always
said
he
saw
things
big
but
no
one
had
ever
believed
he
was
destined
to
carry
them
out
on
the
same
scale
yet
apparently
in
those
idle
apex
days
while
he
seemed
to
be
loafing
and
fooling
as
her
father
called
it
he
had
really
been
sharpening
his
weapons
of
aggression
there
had
been
something
after
all
in
the
effect
of
power
she
had
always
felt
in
him
her
heart
beat
faster
and
she
longed
to
question
van
degen
but
she
was
afraid
of
betraying
herself
and
turned
back
to
the
group
about
the
picture
driscoll
was
still
presenting
objections
in
a
tone
of
small
mild
obstinacy
oh
it
a
likeness
of
course
i
can
see
that
but
there
one
thing
i
must
say
popple
it
looks
like
a
last
year
dress
the
attention
of
the
ladies
instantly
rallied
to
the
picture
and
the
artist
paled
at
the
challenge
it
does
look
like
a
last
year
face
anyhow
that
what
makes
them
all
wild
van
degen
murmured
undine
gave
him
back
a
quick
smile
she
had
already
forgotten
about
moffatt
any
triumph
in
which
she
shared
left
a
glow
in
her
veins
and
the
success
of
the
picture
obscured
all
other
impressions
she
saw
herself
throning
in
a
central
panel
at
the
spring
exhibition
with
the
crowd
pushing
about
the
picture
repeating
her
name
and
she
decided
to
stop
on
the
way
home
and
telephone
her
to
do
a
paragraph
about
popple
tea
but
in
the
hall
as
she
drew
on
her
cloak
her
thoughts
reverted
to
the
driscoll
fancy
ball
what
a
blow
if
it
were
given
up
after
she
had
taken
so
much
trouble
about
her
dress
she
was
to
go
as
the
empress
josephine
after
the
prudhon
portrait
in
the
louvre
the
dress
was
already
fitted
and
partly
embroidered
and
she
foresaw
the
difficulty
of
persuading
the
to
take
it
back
why
so
pale
and
sad
fair
cousin
what
up
van
degen
asked
as
they
emerged
from
the
lift
in
which
they
had
descended
alone
from
the
studio
i
do
know
i
tired
of
posing
and
it
was
so
frightfully
hot
yes
popple
always
keeps
his
place
at
temperature
as
if
the
portraits
might
catch
cold
van
degen
glanced
at
his
watch
where
are
you
off
to
west
end
avenue
of
course
if
i
can
find
a
cab
to
take
me
there
it
was
not
the
least
of
undine
grievances
that
she
was
still
living
in
the
house
which
represented
spragg
first
venture
in
new
york
it
had
been
understood
at
the
time
of
her
marriage
that
the
young
couple
were
to
be
established
within
the
sacred
precincts
of
fashion
but
on
their
return
from
the
honeymoon
the
still
untenanted
house
in
west
end
avenue
had
been
placed
at
their
disposal
and
in
view
of
spragg
financial
embarrassment
even
undine
had
seen
the
folly
of
refusing
it
that
first
winter
she
had
not
regretted
her
exile
while
she
awaited
her
boy
birth
she
was
glad
to
be
out
of
sight
of
fifth
avenue
and
to
take
her
hateful
compulsory
exercise
where
no
familiar
eye
could
fall
on
her
and
the
next
year
of
course
her
father
would
give
them
a
better
house
but
the
next
year
rents
had
risen
in
the
fifth
avenue
quarter
and
meanwhile
little
paul
marvell
from
his
beautiful
pink
cradle
was
already
interfering
with
his
mother
plans
ralph
alarmed
by
the
fresh
rush
of
expenses
sided
with
his
in
urging
undine
to
resign
herself
to
west
end
avenue
and
thus
after
three
years
she
was
still
submitting
to
the
incessant
inflicted
by
the
incongruity
between
her
social
and
geographical
situation
the
need
of
having
to
give
a
west
side
address
to
her
tradesmen
and
the
deeper
irritation
of
hearing
her
friends
say
do
let
me
give
you
a
lift
home
dear
oh
i
forgotten
i
afraid
i
have
the
time
to
go
so
far
it
was
bad
enough
to
have
no
motor
of
her
own
to
be
avowedly
dependent
on
lifts
openly
and
unconcealably
in
quest
of
them
and
perpetually
plotting
to
provoke
their
offer
she
did
so
hate
to
be
seen
in
a
cab
but
to
miss
them
as
often
as
not
because
of
the
remoteness
of
her
destination
emphasized
the
hateful
sense
of
being
out
of
things
van
degen
looked
out
at
the
long
streets
down
which
the
lamps
were
beginning
to
put
their
dreary
yellow
splashes
of
course
you
wo
get
a
cab
on
a
night
like
this
if
you
do
mind
the
open
car
you
better
jump
in
with
me
i
run
you
out
to
the
high
bridge
and
give
you
a
breath
of
air
before
dinner
the
offer
was
tempting
for
undine
triumph
in
the

had
left
her
tired
and
nervous
she
was
beginning
to
learn
that
success
may
be
as
fatiguing
as
failure
moreover
she
was
going
to
a
big
dinner
that
evening
and
the
fresh
air
would
give
her
the
eyes
and
complexion
she
needed
but
in
the
back
of
her
mind
there
lingered
the
vague
sense
of
a
forgotten
engagement
as
she
tried
to
recall
it
she
felt
van
degen
raising
the
fur
collar
about
her
chin
got
anything
you
can
put
over
your
head
will
that
lace
thing
do
come
along
then
he
pushed
her
through
the
swinging
doors
and
added
with
a
laugh
as
they
reached
the
street
you
not
afraid
of
being
seen
with
me
are
you
it
all
right
at
this
hour
ralph
still
swinging
on
a
strap
in
the
elevated
the
winter
twilight
was
deliriously
cold
and
as
they
swept
through
central
park
and
gathered
impetus
for
their
northward
flight
along
the
darkening
boulevard
undine
felt
the
rush
of
physical
joy
that
drowns
scruples
and
silences
memory
her
scruples
indeed
were
not
serious
but
ralph
disliked
her
being
too
much
with
van
degen
and
it
was
her
way
to
get
what
she
wanted
with
as
little
fuss
as
possible
moreover
she
knew
it
was
a
mistake
to
make
herself
too
accessible
to
a
man
of
sort
her
impatience
to
enjoy
was
curbed
by
an
instinct
for
holding
off
and
biding
her
time
that
resembled
the
patient
skill
with
which
her
father
had
conducted
the
sale
of
his
bad
real
estate
in
the
pure
water
move
days
but
now
and
then
youth
had
its
way
she
could
not
always
resist
the
present
pleasure
and
it
was
amusing
too
to
be
talked
about
with
peter
van
degen
who
was
noted
for
not
caring
for
nice
women
she
enjoyed
the
thought
of
triumphing
over
meretricious
charms
it
ennobled
her
in
her
own
eyes
to
influence
such
a
man
for
good
nevertheless
as
the
motor
flew
on
through
the
icy
twilight
her
present
cares
flew
with
it
she
could
not
shake
off
the
thought
of
the
useless
fancy
dress
which
symbolized
the
other
crowding
expenses
she
had
not
dared
confess
to
ralph
van
degen
heard
her
sigh
and
bent
down
lowering
the
speed
of
the
motor
what
the
matter
is
everything
all
right
his
tone
made
her
suddenly
feel
that
she
could
confide
in
him
and
though
she
began
by
murmuring
that
it
was
nothing
she
did
so
with
the
conscious
purpose
of
being
persuaded
to
confess
and
his
extraordinary
niceness
seemed
to
justify
her
and
to
prove
that
she
had
been
right
in
trusting
her
instinct
rather
than
in
following
the
counsels
of
prudence
heretofore
in
their
talks
she
had
never
gone
beyond
the
vaguest
hint
of
material
bothers
as
to
which
dissimulation
seemed
vain
while
one
lived
in
west
end
avenue
but
now
that
the
avowal
of
a
definite
worry
had
been
wrung
from
her
she
felt
the
injustice
of
the
view
generally
taken
of
poor
peter
for
he
had
been
neither
too
enterprising
nor
too
cautious
though
people
said
of
him
that
he
did
care
to
part
he
had
just
laughed
away
in
bluff
brotherly
fashion
the
gnawing
thought
of
the
fancy
dress
had
assured
her
he
give
a
ball
himself
rather
than
miss
seeing
her
wear
it
and
had
added
oh
hang
waiting
for
the
bill
wo
a
couple
of
thou
make
it
all
right
in
a
tone
that
showed
what
a
small
matter
money
was
to
any
one
who
took
the
larger
view
of
life
the
whole
incident
passed
off
so
quickly
and
easily
that
within
a
few
minutes
she
had
settled
down
with
a
nod
for
his
everything
jolly
again
now
to
untroubled
enjoyment
of
the
hour
peace
of
mind
she
said
to
herself
was
all
she
needed
to
make
her
happy
and
that
was
just
what
ralph
had
never
given
her
at
the
thought
his
face
seemed
to
rise
before
her
with
the
sharp
lines
of
care
between
the
eyes
it
was
almost
like
a
part
of
his
nagging
that
he
should
thrust
himself
in
at
such
a
moment
she
tried
to
shut
her
eyes
to
the
face
but
a
moment
later
it
was
replaced
by
another
a
small
odd
likeness
of
itself
and
with
a
cry
of
compunction
she
started
up
from
her
furs
mercy
it
the
boy
birthday
i
was
to
take
him
to
his
grandmother
she
was
to
have
a
cake
for
him
and
ralph
was
to
come
up
town
i
knew
there
was
something
i
forgotten
xv
in
the
dagonet
the
lamps
had
long
been
lit
and
fairford
after
a
last
impatient
turn
had
put
aside
the
curtains
of
worn
damask
to
strain
her
eyes
into
the
darkening
square
she
came
back
to
the
hearth
where
charles
bowen
stood
leaning
between
the
prim
caryatides
of
the
white
marble
no
sign
of
her
she
simply
forgotten
bowen
looked
at
his
watch
and
turned
to
compare
it
with
the
empire
clock
six
why
not
telephone
again
there
must
be
some
mistake
perhaps
she
knew
ralph
would
be
late
laura
laughed
i
have
noticed
that
she
follows
ralph
movements
so
closely
when
i
telephoned
just
now
the
servant
said
she
been
out
since
two
the
nurse
waited
till
four
not
liking
to
come
without
orders
and
now
it
too
late
for
paul
to
come
she
wandered
away
toward
the
farther
end
of
the
room
where
through
doors
a
shining
surface
of
mahogany
reflected
a
cake
in
which
two
candles
dwindled
put
them
out
please
she
said
to
some
one
in
the
background
then
she
shut
the
doors
and
turned
back
to
bowen
it
all
so
unlucky
my
grandfather
giving
up
his
drive
and
mother
backing
out
of
her
hospital
meeting
and
having
all
the
committee
down
on
her
and
henley
i
even
coaxed
henley
away
from
his
bridge
he
escaped
again
just
before
you
came
undine
promised
she
have
the
boy
here
at
four
it
not
as
if
it
had
never
happened
before
she
always
breaking
her
engagements
she
has
so
many
that
it
inevitable
some
should
get
broken
all
if
she
only
choose
now
that
ralph
has
had
into
business
and
is
kept
in
his
office
so
late
it
cruel
of
her
to
drag
him
out
every
night
he
told
us
the
other
day
they
had
dined
at
home
for
a
month
undine
does
seem
to
notice
how
hard
he
works
bowen
gazed
meditatively
at
the
crumbling
fire
no
why
should
she
why
should
she
really
charles
why
should
she
when
she
knows
nothing
about
it
she
may
know
nothing
about
his
business
but
she
must
know
it
her
extravagance
that
forced
him
into
it
fairford
looked
at
bowen
reproachfully
you
talk
as
if
you
were
on
her
side
are
there
sides
already
if
so
i
want
to
look
down
on
them
impartially
from
the
heights
of
pure
speculation
i
want
to
get
a
general
view
of
the
whole
problem
of
american
marriages
fairford
dropped
into
her
with
a
sigh
if
that
what
you
want
you
must
make
haste
most
of
them
do
last
long
enough
to
be
classified
i
grant
you
it
takes
an
active
mind
but
the
weak
point
is
so
frequently
the
same
that
after
a
time
one
knows
where
to
look
for
it
what
do
you
call
the
weak
point
he
paused
the
fact
that
the
average
american
looks
down
on
his
wife
fairford
was
up
with
a
spring
if
that
where
paradox
lands
you
bowen
mildly
stood
his
ground
well
does
he
prove
it
how
much
does
he
let
her
share
in
the
real
business
of
life
how
much
does
he
rely
on
her
judgment
and
help
in
the
conduct
of
serious
affairs
take
ralph
for
instance
you
say
his
wife
extravagance
forces
him
to
work
too
hard
but
that
not
what
wrong
it
normal
for
a
man
to
work
hard
for
a
woman
what
abnormal
is
his
not
caring
to
tell
her
anything
about
it
to
tell
undine
she
be
bored
to
death
if
he
did
just
so
she
even
feel
aggrieved
but
why
because
it
against
the
custom
of
the
country
and
whose
fault
is
that
the
man
again
i
mean
ralph
i
mean
the
genus
he
belongs
to
homo
sapiens
americanus
why
have
we
taught
our
women
to
take
an
interest
in
our
work
simply
because
we
do
take
enough
interest
in
them
fairford
sinking
back
into
her
chair
sat
gazing
at
the
vertiginous
depths
above
which
his
thought
seemed
to
dangle
her
you
do
the
american
man
does
the
most
slaving
yes
and
the
most
indifferent
there
the
point
the
no
argument
against
the
indifference
to
slave
for
women
is
part
of
the
old
american
tradition
lots
of
people
give
their
lives
for
dogmas
ceased
to
believe
in
then
again
in
this
country
the
passion
for
making
money
has
preceded
the
knowing
how
to
spend
it
and
the
american
man
lavishes
his
fortune
on
his
wife
because
he
does
know
what
else
to
do
with
it
then
you
call
it
a
mere
want
of
imagination
for
a
man
to
spend
his
money
on
his
wife
not
necessarily
but
it
a
want
of
imagination
to
fancy
it
all
he
owes
her
look
about
you
and
you
see
what
i
mean
why
does
the
european
woman
interest
herself
so
much
more
in
what
the
men
are
doing
because
she
so
important
to
them
that
they
make
it
worth
her
while
she
not
a
parenthesis
as
she
is
here
she
in
the
very
middle
of
the
picture
i
not
implying
that
ralph
is
interested
in
his
wife
a
passionate
a
pathetic
exception
but
even
he
has
to
conform
to
an
environment
where
all
the
romantic
values
are
reversed
where
does
the
real
life
of
most
american
men
lie
in
some
woman
or
in
their
offices
the
answer
obvious
is
it
the
emotional
centre
of
gravity
not
the
same
in
the
two
hemispheres
in
the
effete
societies
it
love
in
our
new
one
it
business
in
america
the
real
crime
passionnel
is
a
steal
there
more
excitement
in
wrecking
railways
than
homes
bowen
paused
to
light
another
cigarette
and
then
took
up
his
theme
is
that
the
key
to
our
easy
divorces
if
we
cared
for
women
in
the
old
barbarous
possessive
way
do
you
suppose
we
give
them
up
as
readily
as
we
do
the
real
paradox
is
the
fact
that
the
men
who
make
materially
the
biggest
sacrifices
for
their
women
should
do
least
for
them
ideally
and
romantically
and
what
the
result
how
do
the
women
avenge
themselves
all
my
sympathy
with
them
poor
deluded
dears
when
i
see
their
fallacious
little
attempt
to
trick
out
the
leavings
tossed
them
by
the
preoccupied
male
the
money
and
the
motors
and
the
clothes
and
pretend
to
themselves
and
each
other
that
that
what
really
constitutes
life
oh
i
know
what
you
going
to
say
it
less
and
less
of
a
pretense
with
them
i
grant
you
they
more
and
more
succumbing
to
the
force
of
the
suggestion
but
here
and
there
i
fancy
there
one
who
still
sees
through
the
humbug
and
knows
that
money
and
motors
and
clothes
are
simply
the
big
bribe
she
paid
for
keeping
out
of
some
man
way
fairford
presented
an
amazed
silence
to
the
rush
of
this
tirade
but
when
she
rallied
it
was
to
murmur
and
is
undine
one
of
the
exceptions
her
companion
took
the
shot
with
a
smile
no
she
a
monstrously
perfect
result
of
the
system
the
completest
proof
of
its
triumph
ralph
who
the
victim
and
the
exception
ah
poor
ralph
fairford
raised
her
head
quickly
i
hear
him
now
i
suppose
she
added
in
an
undertone
we
ca
give
him
your
explanation
for
his
wife
having
forgotten
to
come
bowen
echoed
her
sigh
and
then
seemed
to
toss
it
from
him
with
his
but
he
stood
in
silence
while
the
door
opened
and
ralph
marvell
entered
well
laura
hallo
charles
have
you
been
celebrating
too
ralph
turned
to
his
sister
it
outrageous
of
me
to
be
so
late
and
i
dare
look
my
son
in
the
face
but
i
stayed
down
town
to
make
provision
for
his
future
birthdays
he
returned
fairford
kiss
do
tell
me
the
party
over
and
the
guest
of
honour
gone
to
bed
as
he
stood
before
them
laughing
and
a
little
flushed
the
strain
of
long
fatigue
sounding
through
his
gaiety
and
looking
out
of
his
anxious
eyes
fairford
threw
a
glance
at
bowen
and
then
turned
away
to
ring
the
bell
sit
down
ralph
you
look
tired
i
give
you
some
tea
he
dropped
into
an
i
did
have
rather
a
rush
to
get
here
but
had
i
better
join
the
revellers
where
are
they
he
walked
to
the
end
of
the
room
and
threw
open
the
doors
hallo
where
have
they
all
gone
to
what
a
jolly
cake
he
went
up
to
it
why
it
never
even
been
cut
fairford
called
after
him
come
and
have
your
tea
first
no
no
tea
afterward
thanks
are
they
all
upstairs
with
my
grandfather
i
must
make
my
peace
with
undine
his
sister
put
her
arm
through
his
and
drew
him
back
to
the
fire
undine
did
come
did
come
who
brought
the
boy
then
he
did
come
either
that
why
the
cake
not
cut
ralph
frowned
what
the
mystery
is
he
ill
or
what
happened
nothing
happened
paul
all
right
apparently
undine
forgot
she
never
went
home
for
him
and
the
nurse
waited
till
it
was
too
late
to
come
she
saw
his
eyes
darken
but
he
merely
gave
a
slight
laugh
and
drew
out
his
cigarette
case
poor
little
paul
poor
chap
he
moved
toward
the
fire
yes
please
some
tea
he
dropped
back
into
his
chair
with
a
look
of
weariness
as
if
some
strong
stimulant
had
suddenly
ceased
to
take
effect
on
him
but
before
the
was
brought
back
he
had
glanced
at
his
watch
and
was
on
his
feet
again
but
this
wo
do
i
must
rush
home
and
see
the
poor
chap
before
dinner
and
my
mother
and
my
grandfather
i
want
to
say
a
word
to
them
i
must
make
paul
excuses
grandfather
taking
his
nap
and
mother
had
to
rush
out
for
a
postponed
committee
meeting
she
left
as
soon
as
we
heard
paul
coming
ah
i
see
he
sat
down
again
yes
make
the
strong
please
i
had
a
beastly
fagging
sort
of
day
he
leaned
back
with
eyes
his
untouched
cup
in
his
hand
bowen
took
leave
and
laura
sat
silent
watching
her
brother
under
lowered
lids
while
she
feigned
to
be
busy
with
the
kettle
ralph
presently
emptied
his
cup
and
put
it
aside
then
sinking
into
his
former
attitude
he
clasped
his
hands
behind
his
head
and
lay
staring
apathetically
into
the
fire
but
suddenly
he
came
to
life
and
started
up
a
had
sounded
outside
and
there
was
a
noise
of
wheels
at
the
door
there
undine
i
wonder
what
could
have
kept
her
he
jumped
up
and
walked
to
the
door
but
it
was
clare
van
degen
who
came
in
at
sight
of
him
she
gave
a
little
murmur
of
pleasure
what
luck
to
find
you
no
not
luck
i
came
because
i
knew
you
be
here
he
never
comes
near
me
laura
i
have
to
hunt
him
down
to
get
a
glimpse
of
him
slender
and
shadowy
in
her
long
furs
she
bent
to
kiss
fairford
and
then
turned
back
to
ralph
yes
i
knew
i
catch
you
here
i
knew
it
was
the
boy
birthday
and
i
brought
him
a
present
a
vulgar
expensive
van
degen
offering
i
not
enough
imagination
left
to
find
the
right
thing
the
thing
it
takes
feeling
and
not
money
to
buy
when
i
look
for
a
present
nowadays
i
never
say
to
the
shopman
want
this
or
that
i
simply
say
me
something
that
costs
so
much
she
drew
a
parcel
from
her
muff
where
the
victim
of
my
vulgarity
let
me
crush
him
under
the
weight
of
my
gold
fairford
sighed
out
clare
clare
and
ralph
smiled
at
his
cousin

to
depute

over

she
looked
surprised
why
i
just
left
mamie
driscoll
and
she
told
me
undine
was
still
at
popple
studio
a
few
minutes
ago
giving
a
tea
to
show
the
picture
popple
giving
a
tea
ralph
struck
an
attitude
of
mock
consternation
ah
in
that
case
in
popple
society
who
would
forget
the
flight
of
time
he
had
recovered
his
usual
easy
tone
and
laura
sat
that
van
degen
words
had
dispelled
his
preoccupation
he
turned
to
his
cousin
will
you
trust
me
with
your
present
for
the
boy
clare
gave
him
the
parcel
i
sorry
not
to
give
it
myself
i
said
what
i
did
because
i
knew
what
you
and
laura
were
thinking
but
it
really
a
battered
old
dagonet
bowl
that
came
down
to
me
from
our
revered
what
the
heirloom
you
used
to
eat
your
porridge
out
of
ralph
detained
her
hand
to
put
a
kiss
on
it
that
dear
of
you
she
threw
him
one
of
her
strange
glances
why
not
say
like
you
but
you
do
remember
what
i
like
she
turned
away
to
glance
at
the
clock
it
late
and
i
must
be
off
i
going
to
a
big
dinner
at
the
chauncey
ellings
but
you
must
be
going
there
too
ralph
better
let
me
drive
you
home
in
the
motor
ralph
leaned
back
in
silence
while
the
rug
was
drawn
over
their
knees
and
clare
restlessly
fingered
the
row
of
objects
in
the
rack
at
her
elbow
it
was
restful
to
be
swept
through
the
crowded
streets
in
this
smooth
fashion
and
clare
presence
at
his
side
gave
him
a
vague
sense
of
ease
for
a
long
time
now
feminine
nearness
had
come
to
mean
to
him
not
this
relief
from
tension
but
the
dread
of
small
daily
deceptions
evasions
subterfuges
the
change
had
come
gradually
marked
by
one
disillusionment
after
another
but
there
had
been
one
moment
that
formed
the
point
beyond
which
there
was
no
returning
it
was
the
moment
a
month
or
two
before
his
boy
birth
when
glancing
over
a
batch
of
belated
paris
bills
he
had
come
on
one
from
the
jeweller
he
had
once
found
in
private
conference
with
undine
the
bill
was
not
large
but
two
of
its
items
stood
out
sharply
resetting
pearl
and
diamond
pendant
resetting
sapphire
and
diamond
ring
the
pearl
and
diamond
pendant
was
his
mother
wedding
present
the
ring
was
the
one
he
had
given
undine
on
their
engagement
that
they
were
both
family
relics
kept
unchanged
through
several
generations
scarcely
mattered
to
him
at
the
time
he
felt
only
the
stab
of
his
wife
deception
she
had
assured
him
in
paris
that
she
had
not
had
her
jewels
reset
he
had
noticed
soon
after
their
return
to
new
york
that
she
had
left
off
her
but
the
others
were
soon
discarded
also
and
in
answer
to
his
question
she
had
told
him
that
in
her
ailing
state
rings
worried
her
now
he
saw
she
had
deceived
him
and
forgetting
everything
else
he
went
to
her
bill
in
hand
her
tears
and
distress
filled
him
with
immediate
contrition
was
this
a
time
to
torment
her
about
trifles
his
anger
seemed
to
cause
her
actual
physical
fear
and
at
the
sight
he
abased
himself
in
entreaties
for
forgiveness
when
the
scene
ended
she
had
pardoned
him
and
the
reset
ring
was
on
her
finger
soon
afterward
the
birth
of
the
boy
seemed
to
wipe
out
these
humiliating
memories
yet
marvell
found
in
time
that
they
were
not
effaced
but
only
momentarily
crowded
out
of
sight
in
reality
the
incident
had
a
meaning
out
of
proportion
to
its
apparent
seriousness
for
it
put
in
his
hand
a
clue
to
a
new
side
of
his
wife
character
he
no
longer
minded
her
having
lied
about
the
jeweller
what
pained
him
was
that
she
had
been
unconscious
of
the
wound
she
inflicted
in
destroying
the
identity
of
the
jewels
he
saw
that
even
after
their
explanation
she
still
supposed
he
was
angry
only
because
she
had
deceived
him
and
the
discovery
that
she
was
completely
unconscious
of
states
of
feeling
on
which
so
much
of
his
inner
life
depended
marked
a
new
stage
in
their
relation
he
was
not
thinking
of
all
this
as
he
sat
beside
clare
van
degen
but
it
was
part
of
the
chronic
disquietude
which
made
him
more
alive
to
his
cousin
sympathy
her
shy
unspoken
understanding
after
all
he
and
she
were
of
the
same
blood
and
had
the
same
traditions
she
was
light
and
frivolous
without
strength
of
will
or
depth
of
purpose
but
she
had
the
frankness
of
her
foibles
and
she
would
never
have
lied
to
him
or
traded
on
his
tenderness
clare
nervousness
gradually
subsided
and
she
lapsed
into
a
mood
which
seemed
like
an
answer
to
his
secret
thought
but
she
did
not
sound
the
personal
note
and
they
chatted
quietly
of
commonplace
things
of
the
at
which
they
were
presently
to
meet
of
the
costume
she
had
chosen
for
the
driscoll
the
recurring
rumours
of
old
driscoll
financial
embarrassment
and
the
mysterious
personality
of
elmer
moffatt
on
whose
movements
wall
street
was
beginning
to
fix
a
fascinated
eye
when
ralph
the
year
after
his
marriage
had
renounced
his
profession
to
go
into
partnership
with
a
firm
of
agents
he
had
come
in
contact
for
the
first
time
with
the
drama
of
business
and
whenever
he
could
turn
his
attention
from
his
own
tasks
he
found
a
certain
interest
in
watching
the
fierce
interplay
of
its
forces
in
the
world
he
had
heard
things
of
moffatt
that
seemed
to
single
him
out
from
the
common
herd
of
anecdotes
of
his
coolness
his
lazy
the
humorous
detachment
he
preserved
in
the
heat
of
conflicting
interests
and
his
figure
was
enlarged
by
the
mystery
that
hung
about
it
the
fact
that
no
one
seemed
to
know
whence
he
came
or
how
he
had
acquired
the
information
which
for
the
moment
was
making
him
so
formidable
i
should
like
to
see
him
ralph
said
he
must
be
a
good
specimen
of
the
one
of
the
few
picturesque
types
we
got
yes
it
might
be
amusing
to
fish
him
out
but
the
most
picturesque
types
in
wall
street
are
generally
the
tamest
in
a
clare
considered
but
does
undine
know
him
i
seem
to
remember
seeing
them
together
undine
and
moffatt
then
you
know
him
you
met
him
not
actually
met
him
but
he
been
pointed
out
to
me
it
must
have
been
some
years
ago
yes
it
was
one
night
at
the
theatre
just
after
you
announced
your
engagement
he
fancied
her
voice
trembled
slightly
as
though
she
thought
he
might
notice
her
way
of
dating
her
memories
you
came
into
our
box
she
went
on
and
i
asked
you
the
name
of
the
man
who
was
sitting
in
the
stall
next
to
undine
you
know
but
some
one
told
us
it
was
moffatt
marvell
was
more
struck
by
her
tone
than
by
what
she
was
saying
if
undine
knows
him
it
odd
she
never
mentioned
it
he
answered
indifferently
the
motor
stopped
at
his
door
and
clare
as
she
held
out
her
hand
turned
a
first
full
look
on
him
why
do
you
never
come
to
see
me
i
miss
you
more
than
ever
she
said
he
pressed
her
hand
without
answering
but
after
the
motor
had
rolled
away
he
stood
for
a
while
on
the
pavement
looking
after
it
when
he
entered
the
house
the
hall
was
still
dark
and
the
small
empty
the
told
him
that
marvell
had
not
yet
come
in
and
he
went
upstairs
to
the
nursery
but
on
the
threshold
the
nurse
met
him
with
the
whispered
request
not
to
make
a
noise
as
it
had
been
hard
to
quiet
the
boy
after
the
disappointment
and
she
had
just
succeeded
in
putting
him
to
sleep
ralph
went
down
to
his
own
room
and
threw
himself
in
the
old
college
in
which
four
years
previously
he
had
sat
the
night
out
dreaming
of
undine
he
had
no
study
of
his
own
and
he
had
crowded
into
his
narrow
his
prints
and
bookshelves
and
the
other
relics
of
his
youth
as
he
sat
among
them
now
the
memory
of
that
other
night
swept
over
him
the
night
when
he
had
heard
the
call
fool
as
he
had
been
not
to
recognize
its
meaning
then
he
knew
himself
triply
mocked
in
being
even
now
at
its
mercy
the
flame
of
love
that
had
played
about
his
passion
for
his
wife
had
died
down
to
its
embers
all
the
transfiguring
hopes
and
illusions
were
gone
but
they
had
left
an
unquenchable
ache
for
her
nearness
her
smile
her
touch
his
life
had
come
to
be
nothing
but
a
long
effort
to
win
these
mercies
by
one
concession
after
another
the
sacrifice
of
his
literary
projects
the
exchange
of
his
profession
for
an
uncongenial
business
and
the
incessant
struggle
to
make
enough
money
to
satisfy
her
increasing
exactions
that
was
where
the
call
had
led
him
the
clock
struck
eight
but
it
was
useless
to
begin
to
dress
till
undine
came
in
and
he
stretched
himself
out
in
his
chair
reached
for
a
pipe
and
took
up
the
evening
paper
his
passing
annoyance
had
died
out
he
was
usually
too
tired
after
his
day
work
for
such
feelings
to
keep
their
edge
long
but
he
was
curious
disinterestedly
curious
to
know
what
pretext
undine
would
invent
for
being
so
late
and
what
excuse
she
would
have
found
for
forgetting
the
little
boy
birthday
he
read
on
till
eight
then
he
stood
up
and
sauntered
to
the
window
the
avenue
below
it
was
deserted
not
a
carriage
or
motor
turned
the
corner
around
which
he
expected
undine
to
appear
and
he
looked
idly
in
the
opposite
direction
there
too
the
perspective
was
nearly
empty
so
empty
that
he
singled
out
a
dozen
blocks
away
the
blazing
lamps
of
a
large
that
was
bearing
furiously
down
the
avenue
from
morningside
as
it
drew
nearer
its
speed
slackened
and
he
saw
it
hug
the
curb
and
stop
at
his
door
by
the
light
of
the
street
lamp
he
recognized
his
wife
as
she
sprang
out
and
detected
a
familiar
silhouette
in
her
companion
figure
then
the
motor
flew
on
and
undine
ran
up
the
steps
ralph
went
out
on
the
landing
he
saw
her
coming
up
quickly
as
if
to
reach
her
room
unperceived
but
when
she
caught
sight
of
him
she
stopped
her
head
thrown
back
and
the
light
falling
on
her
blown
hair
and
glowing
face
well
she
said
smiling
up
at
him
they
waited
for
you
all
the
afternoon
in
washington
square
the
boy
never
had
his
birthday
he
answered
her
colour
deepened
but
she
instantly
rejoined
why
what
happened
why
did
the
nurse
take
him
you
said
you
were
coming
to
fetch
him
so
she
waited
but
i
telephoned
he
said
to
himself
is
that
the
lie
and
answered
where
from
why
the
studio
of
course
she
flung
her
cloak
open
as
if
to
attest
her
veracity
the
sitting
lasted
longer
than
usual
there
was
something
about
the
dress
he
could
get
but
i
thought
he
was
giving
a
tea
he
had
tea
afterward
he
always
does
and
he
asked
some
people
in
to
see
my
portrait
that
detained
me
too
i
did
know
they
were
coming
and
when
they
turned
up
i
could
rush
away
it
would
have
looked
as
if
i
did
like
the
picture
she
paused
and
they
gave
each
other
a
searching
simultaneous
glance
who
told
you
it
was
a
tea
she
asked
clare
van
degen
i
saw
her
at
my
mother
so
you
were
unconsoled
after
all
the
nurse
did
get
any
message
my
people
were
awfully
disappointed
and
the
poor
boy
has
cried
his
eyes
out
dear
me
what
a
fuss
but
i
might
have
known
my
message
would
be
delivered
everything
always
happens
to
put
me
in
the
wrong
with
your
family
with
a
little
air
of
injured
pride
she
started
to
go
to
her
room
but
he
put
out
a
hand
to
detain
her
you
just
come
from
the
studio
yes
it
is
awfully
late
i
must
go
and
dress
we
dining
with
the
ellings
you
know
i
know
how
did
you
come
in
a
cab
she
faced
him
limpidly
no
i
could
find
one
that
would
bring
me
so
peter
gave
me
a
lift
like
an
angel
i
blown
to
bits
he
had
his
open
car
her
colour
was
still
high
and
ralph
noticed
that
her
lower
lip
twitched
a
little
he
had
led
her
to
the
point
they
had
reached
solely
to
be
able
to
say
if
you
straight
from
the
studio
how
was
it
that
i
saw
you
coming
down
from
morningside
unless
he
asked
her
that
there
would
be
no
point
in
his
and
he
would
have
sacrificed
his
pride
without
a
purpose
but
suddenly
as
they
stood
there
face
to
face
almost
touching
she
became
something
immeasurably
alien
and
far
off
and
the
question
died
on
his
lips
is
that
all
she
asked
with
a
slight
smile
yes
you
better
go
and
dress
he
said
and
turned
back
to
his
room
xvi
the
turnings
of
life
seldom
show
a
or
rather
though
the
sign
is
always
there
it
is
usually
placed
some
distance
back
like
the
notices
that
give
warning
of
a
bad
hill
or
a
level
ralph
marvell
pondering
upon
this
reflected
that
for
him
the
sign
had
been
set
more
than
three
years
earlier
in
an
italian
that
day
his
life
had
brimmed
over
so
he
had
put
it
at
the
time
he
saw
now
that
it
had
brimmed
over
indeed
brimmed
to
the
extent
of
leaving
the
cup
empty
or
at
least
of
uncovering
the
dregs
beneath
the
nectar
he
knew
now
that
he
should
never
hereafter
look
at
his
wife
hand
without
remembering
something
he
had
read
in
it
that
day
its
had
been
sweet
enough
but
under
the
rosy
lines
he
had
seen
the
warning
letters
since
then
he
had
been
walking
with
a
ghost
the
miserable
ghost
of
his
illusion
only
he
had
somehow
vivified
coloured
substantiated
it
by
the
force
of
his
own
great
need
as
a
man
might
breathe
a
semblance
of
life
into
a
dear
drowned
body
that
he
can
not
give
up
for
dead
all
this
came
to
him
with
aching
distinctness
the
morning
after
his
talk
with
his
wife
on
the
stairs
he
had
accused
himself
in
midnight
retrospect
of
having
failed
to
press
home
his
conclusion
because
he
dared
not
face
the
truth
but
he
knew
this
was
not
the
case
it
was
not
the
truth
he
feared
it
was
another
lie
if
he
had
foreseen
a
chance
of
her
saying
yes
i
was
with
peter
van
degen
and
for
the
reason
you
think
he
would
have
put
it
to
the
touch
stood
up
to
the
blow
like
a
man
but
he
knew
she
would
never
say
that
she
would
go
on
eluding
and
doubling
watching
him
as
he
watched
her
and
at
that
game
she
was
sure
to
beat
him
in
the
end
on
their
way
home
from
the
elling
dinner
this
certainty
had
become
so
insufferable
that
it
nearly
escaped
him
in
the
cry
you
need
watch
me
i
shall
never
again
watch
you
but
he
had
held
his
peace
knowing
she
would
not
understand
how
little
indeed
she
ever
understood
had
been
made
clear
to
him
when
the
same
night
he
had
followed
her
upstairs
through
the
sleeping
house
she
had
gone
on
ahead
while
he
stayed
below
to
lock
doors
and
put
out
lights
and
he
had
supposed
her
to
be
already
in
her
room
when
he
reached
the
upper
landing
but
she
stood
there
waiting
in
the
spot
where
he
had
waited
for
her
a
few
hours
earlier
she
had
shone
her
vividest
at
dinner
with
revolving
brilliancy
that
collective
approval
always
struck
from
her
and
the
glow
of
it
still
hung
on
her
as
she
paused
there
in
the
dimness
her
shining
cloak
dropped
from
her
white
shoulders
ralphie
she
began
a
soft
hand
on
his
arm
he
stopped
and
she
pulled
him
about
so
that
their
faces
were
close
and
he
saw
her
lips
curving
for
a
kiss
every
line
of
her
face
sought
him
from
the
sweep
of
the
narrowed
eyelids
to
the
dimples
that
played
away
from
her
smile
his
eye
received
the
picture
with
distinctness
but
for
the
first
time
it
did
not
pass
into
his
veins
it
was
as
if
he
had
been
struck
with
a
subtle
blindness
that
permitted
images
to
give
their
colour
to
the
eye
but
communicated
nothing
to
the
brain
he
said
as
he
passed
on
when
a
man
felt
in
that
way
about
a
woman
he
was
surely
in
a
position
to
deal
with
his
case
impartially
this
came
to
ralph
as
the
joyless
solace
of
the
morning
at
last
the
bandage
was
off
and
he
could
see
and
what
did
he
see
only
the
uselessness
of
driving
his
wife
to
subterfuges
that
were
no
longer
necessary
was
van
degen
her
lover
probably
not
the
suspicion
died
as
it
rose
she
would
not
take
more
risks
than
she
could
help
and
it
was
admiration
not
love
that
she
wanted
she
wanted
to
enjoy
herself
and
her
conception
of
enjoyment
was
publicity
promiscuity
the
band
the
banners
the
crowd
the
close
contact
of
covetous
impulses
and
the
sense
of
walking
among
them
in
cool
security
any
personal
entanglement
might
mean
bother
and
bother
was
the
thing
she
most
abhorred
probably
as
the
queer
formula
went
his
honour
was
safe
he
could
count
on
the
letter
of
her
fidelity
at
moment
the
conviction
meant
no
more
to
him
than
if
he
had
been
assured
of
the
honesty
of
the
first
strangers
he
met
in
the
street
a
stranger
that
was
what
she
had
always
been
to
him
so
malleable
outwardly
she
had
remained
insensible
to
the
touch
of
the
heart
these
thoughts
accompanied
him
on
his
way
to
business
the
next
morning
then
as
the
routine
took
him
back
the
feeling
of
strangeness
diminished
there
he
was
again
at
his
daily
task
nothing
tangible
was
altered
he
was
there
for
the
same
purpose
as
yesterday
to
make
money
for
his
wife
and
child
the
woman
he
had
turned
from
on
the
stairs
a
few
hours
earlier
was
still
his
wife
and
the
mother
of
paul
marvell
she
was
an
inherent
part
of
his
life
the
inner
disruption
had
not
resulted
in
any
outward
upheaval
and
with
the
sense
of
inevitableness
there
came
a
sudden
wave
of
pity
poor
undine
she
was
what
the
gods
had
made
her
a
creature
of
reactions
a
mote
in
the
beam
of
pleasure
he
had
no
desire
to
preach
down
such
heart
as
she
had
he
felt
only
a
stronger
wish
to
reach
it
teach
it
move
it
to
something
of
the
pity
that
filled
his
own
they
were
in
the
noyade
of
marriage
but
if
they
ceased
to
struggle
perhaps
the
drowning
would
be
easier
for
both
meanwhile
the
first
of
the
month
was
at
hand
with
its
usual
batch
of
bills
and
there
was
no
time
to
think
of
any
struggle
less
pressing
than
that
connected
with
paying
them
undine
had
been
surprised
and
a
little
disconcerted
at
her
acceptance
of
the
birthday
incident
since
the
resetting
of
her
bridal
ornaments
the
relations
between
washington
square
and
west
end
avenue
had
been
more
and
more
strained
and
the
silent
disapproval
of
the
marvell
ladies
was
more
irritating
to
her
than
open
recrimination
she
knew
how
keenly
ralph
must
feel
her
last
slight
to
his
family
and
she
had
been
frightened
when
she
guessed
that
he
had
seen
her
returning
with
van
degen
he
must
have
been
watching
from
the
window
since
credulous
as
he
always
was
he
evidently
had
a
reason
for
not
believing
her
when
she
told
him
she
had
come
from
the
studio
there
was
therefore
something
both
puzzling
and
disturbing
in
his
silence
and
she
made
up
her
mind
that
it
must
be
either
explained
or
cajoled
away
these
thoughts
were
with
her
as
she
dressed
but
at
the
ellings
they
fled
like
ghosts
before
light
and
laughter
she
had
never
been
more
open
to
the
suggestions
of
immediate
enjoyment
at
last
she
had
reached
the
envied
situation
of
the
pretty
woman
with
whom
society
must
reckon
and
if
she
had
only
had
the
means
to
live
up
to
her
opportunities
she
would
have
been
perfectly
content
with
life
with
herself
and
her
husband
she
still
thought
ralph
sweet
when
she
was
not
bored
by
his
good
advice
or
exasperated
by
his
inability
to
pay
her
bills
the
question
of
money
was
what
chiefly
stood
between
them
and
now
that
this
was
momentarily
disposed
of
by
van
degen
offer
she
looked
at
ralph
more
kindly
she
even
felt
a
return
of
her
first
impersonal
affection
for
him
everybody
could
see
that
clare
van
degen
was
gone
on
him
and
undine
always
liked
to
know
that
what
belonged
to
her
was
coveted
by
others
her
reassurance
had
been
fortified
by
the
news
she
had
heard
at
the
elling
dinner
the
published
fact
of
harmon
driscoll
unexpected
victory
the
ararat
investigation
had
been
mysteriously
stopped
quashed
in
the
language
of
the
law
and
elmer
moffatt
turned
down
as
van
degen
who
sat
next
to
her
expressed
it
i
do
believe
we
ever
hear
of
that
gentleman
again
he
said
contemptuously
and
their
eyes
crossed
gaily
as
she
exclaimed
then
they
give
the
fancy
ball
after
all
i
should
have
given
you
one
anyhow
should
you
have
liked
that
as
well
oh
you
can
give
me
one
too
she
returned
and
he
bent
closer
to
say
by
jove
i
will
and
anything
else
you
want
but
on
the
way
home
her
fears
revived
ralph
indifference
struck
her
as
unnatural
he
had
not
returned
to
the
subject
of
disappointment
had
not
even
asked
her
to
write
a
word
of
excuse
to
his
mother
van
degen
way
of
looking
at
her
at
dinner
he
was
incapable
of
graduating
his
glances
had
made
it
plain
that
the
favour
she
had
accepted
would
necessitate
her
being
more
conspicuously
in
his
company
though
she
was
still
resolved
that
it
should
be
on
just
such
terms
as
she
chose
and
it
would
be
extremely
troublesome
if
at
this
juncture
ralph
should
suddenly
turn
suspicious
and
secretive
undine
hitherto
had
found
more
benefits
than
drawbacks
in
her
marriage
but
now
the
tie
began
to
gall
it
was
hard
to
be
criticized
for
every
grasp
at
opportunity
by
a
man
so
avowedly
unable
to
do
the
reaching
for
her
ralph
had
gone
into
business
to
make
more
money
for
her
but
it
was
plain
that
the
more
would
never
be
much
and
that
he
would
not
achieve
the
quick
rise
to
affluence
which
was
man
natural
tribute
to
woman
merits
undine
felt
herself
trapped
deceived
and
it
was
intolerable
that
the
agent
of
her
disillusionment
should
presume
to
be
the
critic
of
her
conduct
her
annoyance
however
died
out
with
her
fears
ralph
the
morning
after
the
elling
dinner
went
his
way
as
usual
and
after
nerving
herself
for
the
explosion
which
did
not
come
she
set
down
his
indifference
to
the
dulling
effect
of
business
no
wonder
poor
women
whose
husbands
were
always
had
to
look
elsewhere
for
sympathy
van
degen
cheque
helped
to
calm
her
and
the
weeks
whirled
on
toward
the
driscoll
ball
the
ball
was
as
brilliant
as
she
had
hoped
and
her
own
part
in
it
as
thrilling
as
a
page
from
one
of
the
society
novels
with
which
she
had
cheated
the
monotony
of
apex
days
she
had
no
time
for
reading
now
every
hour
was
packed
with
what
she
would
have
called
life
and
the
intensity
of
her
sensations
culminated
on
that
triumphant
evening
what
could
be
more
delightful
than
to
feel
that
while
all
the
women
envied
her
dress
the
men
did
not
so
much
as
look
at
it
their
admiration
was
all
for
herself
and
her
beauty
deepened
under
it
as
flowers
take
a
warmer
colour
in
the
rays
of
sunset
only
van
degen
glance
weighed
on
her
a
little
too
heavily
was
it
possible
that
he
might
become
a
bother
less
negligible
than
those
he
had
relieved
her
of
undine
was
not
greatly
alarmed
she
still
had
full
faith
in
her
powers
of
but
she
disliked
to
feel
the
least
crease
in
the
smooth
surface
of
existence
she
had
always
been
what
her
parents
called
sensitive
as
the
winter
passed
material
cares
once
more
assailed
her
in
the
thrill
of
liberation
produced
by
van
degen
gift
she
had
been
imprudent
had
launched
into
fresh
expenses
not
that
she
accused
herself
of
extravagance
she
had
done
nothing
not
really
necessary
the
for
instance
cried
out
to
be
done
over
and
popple
who
was
an
authority
on
decoration
had
shown
her
with
a
few
strokes
of
his
pencil
how
easily
it
might
be
transformed
into
a
french
period
room
all
curves
and
cupids
just
the
setting
for
a
pretty
woman
and
his
portrait
of
her
but
undine
still
hopeful
of
leaving
west
end
avenue
had
heroically
resisted
the
suggestion
and
contented
herself
with
the
renewal
of
the
curtains
and
carpet
and
the
purchase
of
some
fragile
gilt
chairs
which
as
she
told
ralph
would
be
so
much
to
the
good
when
they
moved
the
explanation
as
she
made
it
seemed
an
additional
evidence
of
her
thrift
partly
as
a
result
of
these
exertions
she
had
a
nervous
breakdown
toward
the
middle
of
the
winter
and
her
physician
having
ordered
massage
and
a
daily
drive
it
became
necessary
to
secure
attendance
and
to
engage
a
motor
by
the
month
other
unforeseen
expenses
the
bills
that
at
such
times
seem
to
run
up
without
visible
impulsion
were
added
to
by
a
severe
illness
of
little
paul
a
long
costly
illness
with
three
nurses
and
frequent
consultations
during
these
days
ralph
anxiety
drove
him
to
what
seemed
to
undine
foolish
excesses
of
expenditure
and
when
the
boy
began
to
get
better
the
doctors
advised
country
air
ralph
at
once
hired
a
small
house
at
tuxedo
and
undine
of
course
accompanied
her
son
to
the
country
but
she
spent
only
the
sundays
with
him
running
up
to
town
during
the
week
to
be
with
her
husband
as
she
explained
this
necessitated
the
keeping
up
of
two
households
and
even
for
so
short
a
time
the
strain
on
ralph
purse
was
severe
so
it
came
about
that
the
bill
for
the
was
still
unpaid
and
undine
left
to
wonder
distractedly
what
had
become
of
van
degen
money
that
van
degen
seemed
also
to
wonder
was
becoming
unpleasantly
apparent
his
cheque
had
evidently
not
brought
in
the
return
he
expected
and
he
put
his
grievance
to
her
frankly
one
day
when
he
motored
down
to
lunch
at
tuxedo
they
were
sitting
after
luncheon
in
the
to
which
undine
had
adapted
her
usual
background
of
cushions
and
flowers
since
one
must
make
one
setting
however
little
one
habits
happened
to
correspond
with
that
particular
effect
undine
conscious
of
the
intimate
charm
of
her
and
of
the
recovered
freshness
and
bloom
which
put
her
in
harmony
with
it
had
never
been
more
sure
of
her
power
to
keep
her
friend
in
the
desired
state
of
adoring
submission
but
peter
as
he
grew
more
adoring
became
less
submissive
and
there
came
a
moment
when
she
needed
all
her
wits
to
save
the
situation
it
was
easy
enough
to
rebuff
him
the
easier
as
his
physical
proximity
always
roused
in
her
a
vague
instinct
of
resistance
but
it
was
hard
so
to
temper
the
rebuff
with
promise
that
the
game
of
suspense
should
still
delude
him
he
put
it
to
her
at
last
standing
squarely
before
her
his
batrachian
sallowness
unpleasantly
flushed
and
primitive
man
looking
out
of
the
eyes
from
which
a
gentleman
usually
pined
at
her
look
here
the
installment
plan
all
right
but
ai
you
a
bit
behind
even
on
that
she
had
brusquely
eluded
a
nearer
approach
anyhow
i
think
i
rather
let
the
interest
accumulate
for
a
while
this
is
till
i
get
back
from
europe
the
announcement
took
her
by
surprise
europe
why
when
are
you
sailing
on
the
first
of
april
good
day
for
a
fool
to
acknowledge
his
folly
i
beaten
and
i
running
away
she
sat
looking
down
her
hand
absently
occupied
with
the
twist
of
pearls
he
had
given
her
in
a
flash
she
saw
the
peril
of
this
departure
once
off
on
the
sorceress
he
was
lost
to
her
the
power
of
old
associations
would
prevail
yet
if
she
were
as
nice
to
him
as
he
asked
nice
enough
to
keep
him
the
end
might
not
be
much
more
to
her
advantage
hitherto
she
had
let
herself
drift
on
the
current
of
their
adventure
but
she
now
saw
what
port
she
had
been
trying
for
if
she
had
striven
so
hard
to
hold
him
had
played
him
with
such
patience
and
such
skill
it
was
for
something
more
than
her
passing
amusement
and
convenience
for
a
purpose
the
more
tenaciously
cherished
that
she
had
not
dared
name
it
to
herself
in
the
light
of
this
discovery
she
saw
the
need
of
feigning
complete
indifference
ah
you
happy
man
it
indeed
then
she
threw
back
at
him
lifting
a
plaintive
smile
to
his
frown
oh
you
turn
up
in
paris
later
i
suppose
to
get
your
things
for
newport
paris
newport
they
not
on
my
map
when
ralph
can
get
away
we
shall
go
to
the
adirondacks
for
the
boy
i
hope
i
sha
need
paris
clothes
there
it
does
matter
at
any
rate
she
ended
laughing
because
nobody
i
care
about
will
see
me
van
degen
echoed
her
laugh
oh
come
that
rough
on
ralph
she
looked
down
with
a
slight
increase
of
colour
i
ought
to
have
said
it
ought
i
but
the
fact
is
i
unhappy
and
a
little
hurt
unhappy
hurt
he
was
at
her
side
again
why
what
wrong
she
lifted
her
eyes
with
a
grave
look
i
thought
you
be
sorrier
to
leave
me
oh
it
wo
be
for
long
it
need
be
you
know
he
was
perceptibly
softening
it
damnable
the
way
you
tied
down
fancy
rotting
all
summer
in
the
adirondacks
why
do
you
stand
it
you
ought
to
be
bound
for
life
by
a
girl
mistake
the
lashes
trembled
slightly
on
her
cheek
are
we
all
bound
by
our
mistakes
we
women
do
let
us
talk
of
such
things
ralph
would
never
let
me
go
abroad
without
him
she
paused
and
then
with
a
quick
upward
sweep
of
the
lids
after
all
it
better
it
should
be
since
i
paying
for
another
mistake
in
being
so
unhappy
at
your
going
another
mistake
why
do
you
call
it
that
because
i
misunderstood
you
or
you
me
she
continued
to
smile
at
him
wistfully
and
some
things
are
best
mended
by
a
break
he
met
her
smile
with
a
loud
sigh
she
could
feel
him
in
the
meshes
again
is
it
to
be
a
break
between
us
have
you
just
said
so
anyhow
it
might
as
well
be
since
we
be
in
the
same
place
again
for
months
the
gentleman
once
more
languished
from
his
eyes
she
thought
she
trembled
on
the
edge
of
victory
hang
it
he
broke
out
you
ought
to
have
a
change
you
looking
awfully
pulled
down
why
ca
you
coax
your
mother
to
run
over
to
paris
with
you
ralph
object
to
that
she
shook
her
head
i
do
believe
she
could
afford
it
even
if
i
could
persuade
her
to
leave
father
you
know
father
has
done
very
well
lately
i
should
like
to
ask
him
for
the
money
you
so
confoundedly
proud
he
was
edging
nearer
it
would
all
be
so
easy
if
you
only
be
a
little
fond
of
me
she
froze
to
her
we
women
ca
repair
our
mistakes
make
me
more
miserable
by
reminding
me
of
mine
oh
nonsense
there
nothing
cash
wo
do
why
wo
you
let
me
straighten
things
out
for
you
her
colour
rose
again
and
she
looked
him
quickly
and
consciously
in
the
eye
it
was
time
to
play
her
last
card
you
seem
to
forget
that
i
am
married
she
said
van
degen
was
silent
for
a
moment
she
thought
he
was
swaying
to
her
in
the
flush
of
surrender
but
he
remained
doggedly
seated
meeting
her
look
with
an
odd
clearing
of
his
heated
gaze
as
if
a
shrewd
businessman
had
suddenly
replaced
the
pining
gentleman
at
the
window
hang
it
so
am
i
he
rejoined
and
undine
saw
that
in
the
last
issue
he
was
still
the
stronger
of
the
two
xvii
nothing
was
bitterer
to
her
than
to
confess
to
herself
the
failure
of
her
power
but
her
last
talk
with
van
degen
had
taught
her
a
lesson
almost
worth
the
abasement
she
saw
the
mistake
she
had
made
in
taking
money
from
him
and
understood
that
if
she
drifted
into
repeating
that
mistake
her
future
would
be
irretrievably
compromised
what
she
wanted
was
not
a
existence
of
precarious
intrigue
to
one
with
her
gifts
the
privileges
of
life
should
come
openly
already
in
her
short
experience
she
had
seen
enough
of
the
women
who
sacrifice
future
security
for
immediate
success
and
she
meant
to
lay
solid
foundations
before
she
began
to
build
up
the
light
of
enjoyment
nevertheless
it
was
galling
to
see
van
degen
leave
and
to
know
that
for
the
time
he
had
broken
away
from
her
over
a
nature
so
insensible
to
the
spells
of
memory
the
visible
and
tangible
would
always
prevail
if
she
could
have
been
with
him
again
in
paris
where
in
the
shining
spring
days
every
sight
and
sound
ministered
to
such
influences
she
was
sure
she
could
have
regained
her
hold
and
the
sense
of
frustration
was
intensified
by
the
fact
that
every
one
she
knew
was
to
be
there
her
potential
rivals
were
crowding
the
steamers
new
york
was
a
desert
and
ralph
seeming
unconsciousness
of
the
fact
increased
her
resentment
she
had
had
but
one
chance
at
europe
since
her
marriage
and
that
had
been
wasted
through
her
husband
unaccountable
perversity
she
knew
now
with
what
packed
hours
of
paris
and
london
they
had
paid
for
their
empty
weeks
in
italy
meanwhile
the
long
months
of
the
new
york
spring
stretched
out
before
her
in
all
their
social
vacancy
to
the
measureless
blank
of
a
summer
in
the
adirondacks
in
her
girlhood
she
had
plumbed
the
dim
depths
of
such
summers
but
then
she
had
been
sustained
by
the
hope
of
bringing
some
capture
to
the
surface
now
she
knew
better
there
were
no
finds
for
her
in
that
direction
the
people
she
wanted
would
be
at
newport
or
in
europe
and
she
was
too
resolutely
bent
on
a
definite
object
too
sternly
animated
by
her
father
business
instinct
to
turn
aside
in
quest
of
casual
distractions
the
chief
difficulty
in
the
way
of
her
attaining
any
distant
end
had
always
been
her
reluctance
to
plod
through
the
intervening
stretches
of
dulness
and
privation
she
had
begun
to
see
this
but
she
could
not
always
master
the
weakness
never
had
she
stood
in
greater
need
of
heeny
go
slow
undine
her
imagination
was
incapable
of
long
flights
she
could
not
cheat
her
impatience
with
the
mirage
of
satisfactions
and
for
the
moment
present
and
future
seemed
equally
void
but
her
desire
to
go
to
europe
and
to
rejoin
the
little
new
york
world
that
was
reforming
itself
in
london
and
paris
was
fortified
by
reasons
which
seemed
urgent
enough
to
justify
an
appeal
to
her
father
she
went
down
to
his
office
to
plead
her
case
fearing
intervention
for
some
time
past
spragg
had
been
rather
continuously
overworked
and
the
strain
was
beginning
to
tell
on
him
he
had
never
quite
regained
in
new
york
the
financial
security
of
his
apex
days
since
he
had
changed
his
base
of
operations
his
affairs
had
followed
an
uncertain
course
and
undine
suspected
that
his
breach
with
his
old
political
ally
the
representative
rolliver
who
had
seen
him
through
the
muddiest
reaches
of
the
pure
water
move
was
not
unconnected
with
his
failure
to
get
a
footing
in
wall
street
but
all
this
was
vague
and
shadowy
to
her
even
had
business
been
less
of
a
mystery
she
was
too
much
absorbed
in
her
own
affairs
to
project
herself
into
her
case
and
she
thought
she
was
sacrificing
enough
to
delicacy
of
feeling
in
sparing
him
the
bother
of
spragg
opposition
when
she
came
to
him
with
a
grievance
he
always
heard
her
out
with
the
same
mild
patience
but
the
long
habit
of
managing
him
had
made
her
in
his
own
language
discount
this
tolerance
and
when
she
ceased
to
speak
her
heart
throbbed
with
suspense
as
he
leaned
back
twirling
an
invisible
toothpick
under
his
sallow
moustache
presently
he
raised
a
hand
to
stroke
the
limp
beard
in
which
the
moustache
was
merged
then
he
groped
for
the
masonic
emblem
that
had
lost
itself
in
one
of
the
folds
of
his
depleted
waistcoat
he
seemed
to
fish
his
answer
from
the
same
rusty
depths
for
as
his
fingers
closed
about
the
trinket
he
said
yes
the
heated
term
is
trying
in
new
york
that
why
the
fresh
air
fund
pulled
my
last
dollar
out
of
me
last
week
undine
frowned
there
was
nothing
more
irritating
in
these
encounters
with
her
father
than
his
habit
of
opening
the
discussion
with
a
joke
i
wish
you
understand
that
i
serious
father
i
never
been
strong
since
the
baby
was
born
and
i
need
a
change
but
it
not
only
that
there
are
other
reasons
for
my
wanting
to
go
spragg
still
held
to
his
mild
tone
of
banter
i
never
knew
you
short
on
reasons
undie
trouble
is
you
do
always
know
other
when
you
see
his
daughter
lips
tightened
i
know
your
reasons
when
i
see
them
father
i
heard
them
often
enough
but
you
ca
know
mine
because
i
have
told
you
not
the
real
ones
jehoshaphat
i
thought
they
were
all
real
as
long
as
you
had
a
use
for
them
experience
had
taught
her
that
such
protracted
trifling
usually
concealed
an
exceptional
vigour
of
resistance
and
the
suspense
strengthened
her
determination
my
reasons
are
all
real
enough
she
answered
but
there
one
more
serious
than
the
others
spragg
brows
began
to
jut
more
bills
no
she
stretched
out
her
hand
and
began
to
finger
the
dusty
objects
on
his
desk
i
unhappy
at
home
unhappy
his
start
overturned
the
gorged
basket
and
shot
a
shower
of
paper
across
the
rug
he
stooped
to
put
the
basket
back
then
he
turned
his
slow
fagged
eyes
on
his
daughter
why
he
worships
the
ground
you
walk
on
undie
that
not
always
a
reason
for
a
woman
it
was
the
answer
she
would
have
given
to
popple
or
van
degen
but
she
saw
in
an
instant
the
mistake
of
thinking
it
would
impress
her
father
in
the
atmosphere
of
sentimental
casuistry
to
which
she
had
become
accustomed
she
had
forgotten
that
spragg
private
rule
of
conduct
was
as
simple
as
his
business
morality
was
complicated
he
glowered
at
her
under
brows
it
is
a
reason
is
it
i
can
seem
to
remember
the
time
when
you
used
to
think
it
was
equal
to
a
whole
carload
of
whitewash
she
blushed
a
bright
red
and
her
own
brows
were
levelled
at
his
above
her
stormy
eyes
the
sense
of
her
blunder
made
her
angrier
with
him
and
more
ruthless
i
ca
expect
you
to
understand
you
never
have
you
or
mother
when
it
came
to
my
feelings
i
suppose
some
people
are
born
sensitive
i
ca
imagine
anybody
choose
to
be
so
because
i
been
too
proud
to
complain
you
taken
it
for
granted
that
i
was
perfectly
happy
but
my
marriage
was
a
mistake
from
the
beginning
and
ralph
feels
just
as
i
do
about
it
his
people
hate
me
they
always
hated
me
and
he
looks
at
everything
as
they
do
they
never
forgiven
me
for
his
having
had
to
go
into
business
with
their
aristocratic
ideas
they
look
down
on
a
man
who
works
for
his
living
of
course
it
all
right
for
you
to
do
it
because
you
not
a
marvell
or
a
dagonet
but
they
think
ralph
ought
to
just
lie
back
and
let
you
support
the
baby
and
me
this
time
she
had
found
the
right
note
she
knew
it
by
the
tightening
of
her
father
slack
muscles
and
the
sudden
straightening
of
his
back
by
george
he
pretty
near
does
he
exclaimed
bringing
down
his
fist
on
the
desk
they
have
been
taking
it
out
of
you
about
that
have
they
they
do
fight
fair
enough
to
say
so
they
just
egg
him
on
to
turn
against
me
they
only
consented
to
his
marrying
me
because
they
thought
you
were
so
crazy
about
the
match
you
give
us
everything
and
he
have
nothing
to
do
but
sit
at
home
and
write
books
spragg
emitted
a
derisive
groan
from
what
i
hear
of
the
amount
of
business
he
doing
i
guess
he
could
keep
the
poet
corner
going
right
along
i
suppose
the
old
man
was
right
he
has
got
it
in
him
to
make
money
of
course
not
he
was
brought
up
to
it
and
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
ashamed
of
having
to
do
it
he
told
me
it
was
killing
a
little
more
of
him
every
day
do
they
back
him
up
in
that
kind
of
talk
they
back
him
up
in
everything
their
ideas
are
all
different
from
ours
they
look
down
on
us
ca
you
see
that
ca
you
guess
how
they
treat
me
from
the
way
they
acted
to
you
and
mother
he
met
this
with
a
puzzled
stare
the
way
they
acted
to
me
and
mother
why
we
never
so
much
as
set
eyes
on
them
that
just
what
i
mean
i
do
believe
they
even
called
on
mother
this
year
have
they
last
year
they
just
left
their
cards
without
asking
and
why
do
you
suppose
they
never
invite
you
to
dine
in
their
set
lots
of
people
older
than
you
and
mother
dine
every
night
of
the
winter
society
full
of
them
the
marvells
are
ashamed
to
have
you
meet
their
friends
that
the
reason
they
ashamed
to
have
it
known
that
ralph
married
an
apex
girl
and
that
you
and
mother
have
always
had
your
own
servants
and
carriages
and
ralph
ashamed
of
it
too
now
he
got
over
being
crazy
about
me
if
he
was
free
i
believe
he
turn
round
and
marry
that
ray
girl
his
mother
saving
up
for
him
spragg
listened
with
a
heavy
brow
and
lip
his
outburst
seemed
at
last
to
have
roused
him
to
a
faint
resentment
after
she
had
ceased
to
speak
he
remained
silent
twisting
an
inky
penhandle
between
his
fingers
then
he
said
i
guess
mother
and
i
can
worry
along
without
having
ralph
relatives
drop
in
but
i
like
to
make
it
clear
to
them
that
if
you
came
from
apex
your
income
came
from
there
too
i
presume
they
be
sorry
if
ralph
was
left
to
support
you
on
his
she
saw
that
she
had
scored
in
the
first
part
of
the
argument
but
every
watchful
nerve
reminded
her
that
the
hardest
stage
was
still
ahead
oh
they
willing
enough
he
should
take
your
money
that
only
natural
they
think
a
chuckle
sounded
deep
down
under
spragg
loose
collar
there
seems
to
be
practical
unanimity
on
that
point
he
observed
but
i
do
see
he
continued
jerking
round
his
bushy
brows
on
her
how
going
to
europe
is
going
to
help
you
out
undine
leaned
close
enough
for
her
lowered
voice
to
reach
him
you
understand
that
knowing
how
they
all
feel
about
me
and
how
ralph
feels
i
give
almost
anything
to
get
away
her
father
looked
at
her
compassionately
i
guess
most
of
us
feel
that
once
in
a
way
when
we
youngy
undine
later
on
you
see
going
away
ai
much
use
when
you
got
to
turn
round
and
come
back
she
nodded
at
him
with
lips
like
a
child
in
possession
of
some
solemn
secret
that
just
it
that
the
reason
i
so
wild
to
go
because
it
might
mean
i
would
ever
have
to
come
back
not
come
back
what
on
earth
are
you
talking
about
it
might
mean
that
i
could
get
free
begin
over
again
he
had
pushed
his
seat
back
with
a
sudden
jerk
and
cut
her
short
by
striking
his
palm
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
for
the
lord
sake
undine
do
you
know
what
you
saying
oh
yes
i
know
she
gave
him
back
a
confident
smile
if
i
can
get
away
soon
go
straight
over
to
paris
there
some
one
there
who
do
anything
who
could
do
anything
if
i
was
free
spragg
hands
continued
to
grasp
his
good
god
undine
marvell
are
you
sitting
there
in
your
sane
senses
and
talking
to
me
of
what
you
could
do
if
you
were
free
their
glances
met
in
an
interval
of
speechless
communion
but
undine
did
not
shrink
from
her
father
eyes
and
when
she
lowered
her
own
it
seemed
to
be
only
because
there
was
nothing
left
for
them
to
say
i
know
just
what
i
could
do
if
i
were
free
i
could
marry
the
right
man
she
answered
boldly
he
met
her
with
a
murmur
of
helpless
irony
the
right
man
the
right
man
have
you
had
enough
of
trying
for
him
yet
as
he
spoke
the
door
behind
them
opened
and
spragg
looked
up
abruptly
the
stenographer
stood
on
the
threshold
and
above
her
shoulder
undine
perceived
the
ingratiating
grin
of
elmer
moffatt
little
farther
lend
thy
guiding
hand
but
i
guess
i
can
go
the
rest
of
the
way
alone
he
said
insinuating
himself
through
the
doorway
with
an
airy
gesture
of
dismissal
then
he
turned
to
spragg
and
undine
i
agree
entirely
with
marvell
and
i
happy
to
have
the
opportunity
of
telling
her
so
he
proclaimed
holding
his
hand
out
gallantly
undine
stood
up
with
a
laugh
it
sounded
like
old
times
i
suppose
you
thought
father
and
i
were
quarrelling
but
we
never
quarrel
any
more
he
always
agrees
with
me
she
smiled
at
spragg
and
turned
her
shining
eyes
on
moffatt
i
wish
that
treaty
had
been
signed
a
few
years
sooner
the
latter
rejoined
in
his
usual
tone
of
humorous
familiarity
undine
had
not
met
him
since
her
marriage
and
of
late
the
adverse
turn
of
his
fortunes
had
carried
him
quite
beyond
her
thoughts
but
his
actual
presence
was
always
stimulating
and
even
through
her
she
was
struck
by
his
air
of
almost
defiant
prosperity
he
did
not
look
like
a
man
who
has
been
beaten
or
rather
he
looked
like
a
man
who
does
not
know
when
he
is
beaten
and
his
eye
had
the
gleam
of
mocking
confidence
that
had
carried
him
unabashed
through
his
lowest
hours
at
apex
i
presume
you
here
to
see
me
on
business
spragg
enquired
rising
from
his
chair
with
a
glance
that
seemed
to
ask
his
silence
why
yes
senator
rejoined
moffatt
who
was
given
in
playful
moments
to
the
bestowal
of
titles
at
least
i
here
to
ask
you
a
little
question
that
may
lead
to
business
spragg
crossed
the
office
and
held
open
the
door
step
this
way
please
he
said
guiding
moffatt
out
before
him
though
the
latter
hung
back
to
exclaim
no
family
secrets
marvell
anybody
can
turn
the
fierce
white
light
on
me
with
the
closing
of
the
door
undine
thoughts
turned
back
to
her
own
preoccupations
it
had
not
struck
her
as
incongruous
that
moffatt
should
have
business
dealings
with
her
father
she
was
even
a
little
surprised
that
spragg
should
still
treat
him
so
coldly
but
she
had
no
time
to
give
to
such
considerations
her
own
difficulties
were
too
importunately
present
to
her
she
moved
restlessly
about
the
office
listening
to
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
two
voices
on
the
other
side
of
the
partition
without
once
wondering
what
they
were
discussing
what
should
she
say
to
her
father
when
he
came
back
what
argument
was
most
likely
to
prevail
with
him
if
he
really
had
no
money
to
give
her
she
was
imprisoned
fast
van
degen
was
lost
to
her
and
the
old
life
must
go
on
interminably
in
her
nervous
pacings
she
paused
before
the
blotched
that
hung
in
a
corner
of
the
office
under
a
steel
engraving
of
daniel
webster
even
that
defective
surface
could
not
disfigure
her
and
she
drew
fresh
hope
from
the
sight
of
her
beauty
her
few
weeks
of
had
given
her
cheeks
a
subtler
curve
and
deepened
the
shadows
beneath
her
eyes
and
she
was
handsomer
than
before
her
marriage
no
van
degen
was
not
lost
to
her
even
from
narrowed
lids
to
parted
lips
her
face
was
swept
by
a
smile
like
retracted
sunlight
he
was
not
lost
to
her
while
she
could
smile
like
that
besides
even
if
her
father
had
no
money
there
were
always
mysterious
ways
of
raising
it
in
the
old
apex
days
he
had
often
boasted
of
such
feats
as
the
hope
rose
her
eyes
widened
trustfully
and
this
time
the
smile
that
flowed
up
to
them
was
as
limpid
as
a
child
that
was
the
was
her
father
liked
her
to
look
at
him
the
door
opened
and
she
heard
spragg
say
behind
her
no
sir
i
wo
that
final
he
came
in
alone
with
a
brooding
face
and
lowered
himself
heavily
into
his
chair
it
was
plain
that
the
talk
between
the
two
men
had
had
an
abrupt
ending
undine
looked
at
her
father
with
a
passing
flicker
of
curiosity
certainly
it
was
an
odd
coincidence
that
moffatt
should
have
called
while
she
was
there
what
did
he
want
she
asked
glancing
back
toward
the
door
spragg
mumbled
his
invisible
toothpick
oh
just
another
of
his
schemes
some
deal
he
in
why
did
he
come
to
you
about
it
he
looked
away
from
her
fumbling
among
the
letters
on
the
desk
guess
he
tried
everybody
else
first
he
go
and
ring
the
devil
bell
if
he
thought
he
could
get
anything
out
of
him
i
suppose
he
did
himself
a
lot
of
harm
by
testifying
in
the
ararat
investigation
yes
sir
he
down
and
out
this
time
he
uttered
the
words
with
a
certain
satisfaction
his
daughter
did
not
answer
and
they
sat
silent
facing
each
other
across
the
littered
desk
under
their
brief
about
elmer
moffatt
currents
of
rapid
intelligence
seemed
to
be
flowing
between
them
suddenly
undine
leaned
over
the
desk
her
eyes
widening
trustfully
and
the
limpid
smile
flowing
up
to
them
father
i
did
what
you
wanted
that
one
time
anyhow
wo
you
listen
to
me
and
help
me
out
now
xviii
undine
stood
alone
on
the
landing
outside
her
father
office
only
once
before
had
she
failed
to
gain
her
end
with
him
and
there
was
a
peculiar
irony
in
the
fact
that
moffatt
intrusion
should
have
brought
before
her
the
providential
result
of
her
previous
failure
not
that
she
confessed
to
any
real
resemblance
between
the
two
situations
in
the
present
case
she
knew
well
enough
what
she
wanted
and
how
to
get
it
but
the
analogy
had
served
her
father
purpose
and
unlucky
entrance
had
visibly
strengthened
his
resistance
the
worst
of
it
was
that
the
obstacles
in
the
way
were
real
enough
spragg
had
not
put
her
off
with
vague
asseverations
somewhat
against
her
will
he
had
forced
his
proofs
on
her
showing
her
how
much
above
his
promised
allowance
he
had
contributed
in
the
last
three
years
to
the
support
of
her
household
since
she
could
not
accuse
herself
of
extravagance
having
still
full
faith
in
her
gift
of
managing
she
could
only
conclude
that
it
was
impossible
to
live
on
what
her
father
and
ralph
could
provide
and
this
seemed
a
practical
reason
for
desiring
her
freedom
if
she
and
ralph
parted
he
would
of
course
return
to
his
family
and
spragg
would
no
longer
be
burdened
with
a
helpless
but
even
this
argument
did
not
move
him
undine
as
soon
as
she
had
risked
van
degen
name
found
herself
face
to
face
with
a
code
of
domestic
conduct
as
rigid
as
its
exponent
business
principles
were
elastic
spragg
did
not
regard
divorce
as
intrinsically
wrong
or
even
inexpedient
and
of
its
social
disadvantages
he
had
never
even
heard
lots
of
women
did
it
as
undine
said
and
if
their
reasons
were
adequate
they
were
justified
if
ralph
marvell
had
been
a
drunkard
or
unfaithful
spragg
would
have
approved
undine
desire
to
divorce
him
but
that
it
should
be
prompted
by
her
inclination
for
another
man
and
a
man
with
a
wife
of
his
own
was
as
shocking
to
him
as
it
would
have
been
to
the
most
uncompromising
of
the
dagonets
and
marvells
such
things
happened
as
spragg
knew
but
they
should
not
happen
to
any
woman
of
his
name
while
he
had
the
power
to
prevent
it
and
undine
recognized
that
for
the
moment
he
had
that
power
as
she
emerged
from
the
elevator
she
was
surprised
to
see
moffatt
in
the
vestibule
his
presence
was
an
irritating
reminder
of
her
failure
and
she
walked
past
him
with
a
rapid
bow
but
he
overtook
her
marvell
i
been
waiting
to
say
a
word
to
you
if
it
had
been
any
one
else
she
would
have
passed
on
but
voice
had
always
a
detaining
power
even
now
that
she
knew
him
to
be
defeated
and
negligible
the
power
asserted
itself
and
she
paused
to
say
i
afraid
i
ca
stop
i
late
for
an
engagement
i
sha
make
you
much
later
but
if
you
rather
have
me
call
round
at
your
house
oh
i
so
seldom
in
she
turned
a
wondering
look
on
him
what
is
it
you
wanted
to
say
just
two
words
i
got
an
office
in
this
building
and
the
shortest
way
would
be
to
come
up
there
for
a
minute
as
her
look
grew
distant
he
added
i
think
what
i
got
to
say
is
worth
the
trip
his
face
was
serious
without
underlying
irony
the
face
he
wore
when
he
wanted
to
be
trusted
very
well
she
said
turning
back
undine
glancing
at
her
watch
as
she
came
out
of
moffatt
office
saw
that
he
had
been
true
to
his
promise
of
not
keeping
her
more
than
ten
minutes
the
fact
was
characteristic
under
all
his
incalculableness
there
had
always
been
a
hard
foundation
of
reliability
it
seemed
to
be
a
matter
of
choice
with
him
whether
he
let
one
feel
that
solid
bottom
or
not
and
in
specific
matters
the
same
quality
showed
itself
in
an
accuracy
of
statement
a
precision
of
conduct
that
contrasted
curiously
with
his
usual
hyperbolic
banter
and
his
loose
lounging
manner
no
one
could
be
more
elusive
yet
no
one
could
be
firmer
to
the
touch
her
face
had
cleared
and
she
moved
more
lightly
as
she
left
the
building
moffatt
communication
had
not
been
completely
clear
to
her
but
she
understood
the
outline
of
the
plan
he
had
laid
before
her
and
was
satisfied
with
the
bargain
they
had
struck
he
had
begun
by
reminding
her
of
her
promise
to
introduce
him
to
any
friend
of
hers
who
might
be
useful
in
the
way
of
business
over
three
years
had
passed
since
they
had
made
the
pact
and
moffatt
had
kept
loyally
to
his
side
of
it
with
the
lapse
of
time
the
whole
matter
had
become
less
important
to
her
but
she
wanted
to
prove
her
good
faith
and
when
he
reminded
her
of
her
promise
she
at
once
admitted
it
well
then
i
want
you
to
introduce
me
to
your
husband
undine
was
surprised
but
beneath
her
surprise
she
felt
a
quick
sense
of
relief
ralph
was
easier
to
manage
than
so
many
of
her
friends
and
it
was
a
mark
of
his
present
indifference
to
acquiesce
in
anything
she
suggested
my
husband
why
what
can
he
do
for
you
moffatt
explained
at
once
in
the
fewest
words
as
his
way
was
when
it
came
to
business
he
was
interested
in
a
big
deal
which
involved
the
purchase
of
a
piece
of
real
estate
held
by
a
number
of
wrangling
heirs
the
broker
with
whom
ralph
marvell
was
associated
represented
these
heirs
but
moffatt
had
his
reasons
for
not
approaching
him
directly
and
he
did
want
to
go
to
marvell
with
a
business
proposition
it
would
be
better
to
be
thrown
with
him
socially
as
if
by
accident
it
was
with
that
object
that
moffatt
had
just
appealed
to
spragg
but
spragg
as
usual
had
turned
him
down
without
even
consenting
to
look
into
the
case
he
rather
have
you
miss
a
good
thing
than
have
it
come
to
you
through
me
i
do
know
what
on
earth
he
thinks
it
in
my
power
to
do
to
you
or
ever
was
for
that
matter
he
added
anyhow
he
went
on
to
explain
the
power
all
on
your
side
now
and
i
show
you
how
little
the
doing
will
hurt
you
as
soon
as
i
can
have
a
quiet
chat
with
your
husband
he
branched
off
again
into
technicalities
nebulous
projections
of
capital
and
interest
taxes
and
rents
from
which
she
finally
extracted
and
clung
to
the
central
fact
that
if
the
deal
went
through
it
would
mean
a
commission
of
forty
thousand
dollars
to
marvell
firm
of
which
something
over
a
fourth
would
come
to
ralph
by
jove
that
an
amazing
fellow
ralph
marvell
exclaimed
turning
back
into
the
a
few
evenings
later
at
the
conclusion
of
one
of
their
little
dinners
undine
looked
up
from
her
seat
by
the
fire
she
had
had
the
inspired
thought
of
inviting
moffatt
to
meet
clare
van
degen
fairford
and
charles
bowen
it
had
occurred
to
her
that
the
simplest
way
of
explaining
moffatt
was
to
tell
ralph
that
she
had
unexpectedly
discovered
an
old
apex
acquaintance
in
the
protagonist
of
the
great
ararat
trust
fight
moffatt
defeat
had
not
wholly
divested
him
of
interest
as
a
factor
in
affairs
he
no
longer
inspired
apprehension
but
as
the
man
who
had
dared
to
defy
harmon
driscoll
he
was
a
conspicuous
and
to
some
minds
almost
an
heroic
figure
undine
remembered
that
clare
and
fairford
had
once
expressed
a
wish
to
see
this
braver
of
the
olympians
and
her
suggestion
that
he
should
be
asked
meet
them
gave
ralph
evident
pleasure
it
was
long
since
she
had
made
any
conciliatory
sign
to
his
family
moffatt
social
gifts
were
hardly
of
a
kind
to
please
the
two
ladies
he
would
have
shone
more
brightly
in
peter
van
degen
set
than
in
his
wife
but
neither
clare
nor
fairford
had
expected
a
man
of
conventional
cut
and
moffatt
loud
easiness
was
obviously
less
disturbing
to
them
than
to
their
hostess
undine
felt
only
his
crudeness
and
the
tacit
criticism
passed
on
it
by
the
mere
presence
of
such
men
as
her
husband
and
bowen
but
fairford
seemed
to
enjoy
provoking
him
to
fresh
excesses
of
slang
and
hyperbole
gradually
she
drew
him
into
talking
of
the
driscoll
campaign
and
he
became
recklessly
explicit
he
seemed
to
have
nothing
to
hold
back
all
the
details
of
the
prodigious
exploit
poured
from
him
with
homeric
volume
then
he
broke
off
abruptly
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
and
shaping
his
red
lips
to
a
whistle
which
he
checked
as
his
glance
met
undine
to
conceal
his
embarrassment
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
looked
about
the
table
with
complacency
and
said
i
do
mind
if
i
do
to
the
servant
who
approached
to
his
champagne
glass
the
men
sat
long
over
their
cigars
but
after
an
interval
undine
called
charles
bowen
into
the
to
settle
some
question
in
dispute
between
clare
and
fairford
and
thus
gave
moffatt
a
chance
to
be
alone
with
her
husband
now
that
their
guests
had
gone
she
was
throbbing
with
anxiety
to
know
what
had
passed
between
the
two
but
when
ralph
rejoined
her
in
the
she
continued
to
keep
her
eyes
on
the
fire
and
twirl
her
fan
listlessly
that
an
amazing
chap
ralph
repeated
looking
down
at
her
where
was
it
you
ran
across
him
out
at
apex
as
he
leaned
against
the
lighting
his
cigarette
it
struck
undine
that
he
looked
less
fagged
and
lifeless
than
usual
and
she
felt
more
and
more
sure
that
something
important
had
happened
during
the
moment
of
isolation
she
had
contrived
she
opened
and
shut
her
fan
reflectively
yes
years
ago
father
had
some
business
with
him
and
brought
him
home
to
dinner
one
day
and
you
never
seen
him
since
she
waited
as
if
trying
to
piece
her
recollections
together
i
suppose
i
must
have
but
all
that
seems
so
long
ago
she
said
sighing
she
had
been
given
of
late
to
such
plaintive
glances
toward
her
happy
girlhood
but
ralph
seemed
not
to
notice
the
allusion
do
you
know
he
exclaimed
after
a
moment
i
do
believe
the
fellow
beaten
yet
she
looked
up
quickly
do
you
no
and
i
could
see
that
bowen
did
either
he
strikes
me
as
the
kind
of
man
who
develops
slowly
needs
a
big
field
and
perhaps
makes
some
big
mistakes
but
gets
where
he
wants
to
in
the
end
jove
i
wish
i
could
put
him
in
a
book
there
something
epic
about
him
a
kind
of
epic
effrontery
undine
pulses
beat
faster
as
she
listened
was
it
not
what
moffatt
had
always
said
of
himself
that
all
he
needed
was
time
and
how
odd
that
ralph
who
seemed
so
dreamy
and
unobservant
should
instantly
have
reached
the
same
conclusion
but
what
she
wanted
to
know
was
the
practical
result
of
their
meeting
what
did
you
and
he
talk
about
when
you
were
smoking
oh
he
got
on
the
driscoll
fight
again
gave
us
some
extraordinary
details
the
man
a
thundering
brute
but
he
full
of
observation
and
humour
then
after
bowen
joined
you
he
told
me
about
a
new
deal
gone
into
rather
a
promising
scheme
but
on
the
same
titanic
scale
it
just
possible
by
the
way
that
we
may
be
able
to
do
something
for
him
part
of
the
property
he
after
is
held
in
our
office
he
paused
knowing
undine
indifference
to
business
matters
but
the
face
she
turned
to
him
was
alive
with
interest
you
mean
you
might
sell
the
property
to
him
well
if
the
thing
comes
off
there
would
be
a
big
commission
if
we
did
he
glanced
down
on
her
half
ironically
you
like
that
you
she
answered
with
a
shade
of
reproach
why
do
you
say
that
i
complained
oh
no
but
i
know
i
been
a
disappointment
as
a
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
closing
her
eyes
as
if
in
utter
weariness
and
indifference
and
in
a
moment
she
felt
him
bending
over
her
the
matter
do
you
feel
well
i
a
little
tired
it
nothing
she
pulled
her
hand
away
and
burst
into
tears
ralph
knelt
down
by
her
chair
and
put
his
arm
about
her
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
touched
her
since
the
night
of
the
boy
birthday
and
the
sense
of
her
softness
woke
a
momentary
warmth
in
his
veins
what
is
it
dear
what
is
it
without
turning
her
head
she
sobbed
out
you
seem
to
think
i
too
selfish
and
odious
that
i
just
pretending
to
be
no
no
he
assured
her
smoothing
back
her
hair
but
she
continued
to
sob
on
in
a
gradual
crescendo
of
despair
till
the
vehemence
of
her
weeping
began
to
frighten
him
and
he
drew
her
to
her
feet
and
tried
to
persuade
her
to
let
herself
be
led
upstairs
she
yielded
to
his
arm
sobbing
in
short
exhausted
gasps
and
leaning
her
whole
weight
on
him
as
he
guided
her
along
the
passage
to
her
bedroom
on
the
lounge
to
which
he
lowered
her
she
lay
white
and
still
tears
trickling
through
her
lashes
and
her
handkerchief
pressed
against
her
lips
he
recognized
the
symptoms
with
a
sinking
heart
she
was
on
the
verge
of
a
nervous
attack
such
as
she
had
had
in
the
winter
and
he
foresaw
with
dismay
the
disastrous
train
of
consequences
the
doctors
and
nurses
bills
and
all
the
attendant
confusion
and
expense
if
only
moffatt
project
might
be
realized
if
for
once
he
could
feel
a
round
sum
in
his
pocket
and
be
freed
from
the
perpetual
daily
strain
the
next
morning
undine
though
calmer
was
too
weak
to
leave
her
bed
and
her
doctor
prescribed
rest
and
absence
of
worry
later
perhaps
a
change
of
scene
he
explained
to
ralph
that
nothing
was
so
wearing
to
a
nature
as
monotony
and
that
if
marvell
were
contemplating
a
newport
season
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
be
fortified
to
meet
it
in
such
cases
he
often
recommended
a
dash
to
paris
or
london
just
to
tone
up
the
nervous
system
undine
regained
her
strength
slowly
and
as
the
days
dragged
on
the
suggestion
of
the
european
trip
recurred
with
increasing
frequency
but
it
came
always
from
her
medical
adviser
she
herself
had
grown
strangely
passive
and
indifferent
she
continued
to
remain
upstairs
on
her
lounge
seeing
no
one
but
heeny
whose
daily
ministrations
had
once
more
been
prescribed
and
asking
only
that
the
noise
of
paul
play
should
be
kept
from
her
his
scamperings
overhead
disturbed
her
sleep
and
his
bed
was
moved
into
the
day
nursery
above
his
father
room
the
early
romping
did
not
trouble
ralph
since
he
himself
was
always
awake
before
daylight
the
days
were
not
long
enough
to
hold
his
cares
and
they
came
and
stood
by
him
through
the
silent
hours
when
there
was
no
other
sound
to
drown
their
voices
ralph
had
not
made
a
success
of
his
business
the
brokers
who
had
taken
him
into
partnership
had
done
so
only
with
the
hope
of
profiting
by
his
social
connections
and
in
this
respect
the
alliance
had
been
a
failure
it
was
in
such
directions
that
he
most
lacked
facility
and
so
far
he
had
been
of
use
to
his
partners
only
as
an
he
was
resigned
to
the
continuance
of
such
drudgery
though
all
his
powers
cried
out
against
it
but
even
for
the
routine
of
business
his
aptitude
was
small
and
he
began
to
feel
that
he
was
not
considered
an
addition
to
the
firm
the
difficulty
of
finding
another
opening
made
him
fear
a
break
and
his
thoughts
turned
hopefully
to
elmer
moffatt
hint
of
a
deal
the
success
of
the
negotiation
might
bring
advantages
beyond
the
immediate
pecuniary
profit
and
that
at
the
present
juncture
was
important
enough
in
itself
moffatt
reappeared
two
days
after
the
dinner
presenting
himself
in
west
end
avenue
in
the
late
afternoon
with
the
explanation
that
the
business
in
hand
necessitated
discretion
and
that
he
preferred
not
to
be
seen
in
ralph
office
it
was
a
question
of
negotiating
with
the
utmost
privacy
for
the
purchase
of
a
small
strip
of
land
between
two
large
plots
already
acquired
by
purchasers
cautiously
designated
by
moffatt
as
his
parties
how
far
he
stood
in
with
the
parties
he
left
it
to
ralph
to
conjecture
but
it
was
plain
that
he
had
a
large
stake
in
the
transaction
and
that
it
offered
him
his
first
chance
of
recovering
himself
since
driscoll
had
thrown
him
the
owners
of
the
coveted
plot
did
not
seem
anxious
to
sell
and
there
were
personal
reasons
for
moffatt
not
approaching
them
through
ralph
partners
who
were
the
regular
agents
of
the
estate
so
that
ralph
acquaintance
with
the
conditions
combined
with
his
detachments
from
the
case
marked
him
out
as
a
useful
intermediary
their
first
talk
left
ralph
with
a
dazzled
sense
of
moffatt
strength
and
keenness
but
with
a
vague
doubt
as
to
the
straightness
of
the
proposed
transaction
ralph
had
never
seen
his
way
clearly
in
that
dim
underworld
of
affairs
where
men
of
the
moffatt
and
driscoll
type
moved
like
shadowy
destructive
monsters
beneath
the
darting
small
fry
of
the
surface
he
knew
that
business
has
created
its
own
special
morality
and
his
musings
on
man
relation
to
his
self
imposed
laws
had
shown
him
how
little
human
conduct
is
generally
troubled
about
its
own
sanctions
he
had
a
vivid
sense
of
the
things
a
man
of
his
kind
did
do
but
his
inability
to
get
a
mental
grasp
on
large
financial
problems
made
it
hard
to
apply
to
them
so
simple
a
measure
as
this
inherited
standard
he
only
knew
as
moffatt
plan
developed
that
it
seemed
all
right
while
he
talked
of
it
with
its
originator
but
vaguely
wrong
when
he
thought
it
over
afterward
it
occurred
to
him
to
consult
his
grandfather
and
if
he
renounced
the
idea
for
the
obvious
reason
that
dagonet
ignorance
of
business
was
as
fathomless
as
his
own
this
was
not
his
sole
motive
finally
it
occurred
to
him
to
put
the
case
hypothetically
to
spragg
as
far
as
ralph
knew
his
business
record
was
unblemished
yet
one
felt
in
him
an
elasticity
of
adjustment
not
allowed
for
in
the
dagonet
code
spragg
listened
thoughtfully
to
ralph
statement
of
the
case
growling
out
here
and
there
a
tentative
correction
and
turning
his
cigar
between
his
lips
as
he
seemed
to
turn
the
problem
over
in
the
loose
grasp
of
his
mind
well
what
the
trouble
with
it
he
asked
at
length
stretching
his
big
shoes
against
the
grate
of
his
where
in
the
privacy
of
a
family
evening
ralph
had
seized
the
occasion
to
consult
him
the
trouble
ralph
considered
why
that
just
what
i
should
like
you
to
explain
to
me
spragg
threw
back
his
head
and
stared
at
the
garlanded
french
clock
on
the
spragg
was
sitting
upstairs
in
her
bedroom
and
the
silence
of
the
house
seemed
to
hang
about
the
two
men
like
a
listening
presence
well
i
dunno
but
what
i
agree
with
the
doctor
who
said
there
any
diseases
but
only
sick
people
every
case
is
different
i
guess
spragg
munching
his
cigar
turned
a
ruminating
glance
on
ralph
seems
to
me
it
all
boils
down
to
one
thing
was
this
fellow
supposing
about
under
any
obligation
to
the
other
party
the
one
he
was
trying
to
buy
the
property
from
ralph
hesitated
only
the
obligation
recognized
between
decent
men
to
deal
with
each
other
decently
spragg
listened
to
this
with
the
suffering
air
of
a
teacher
compelled
to
simplify
upon
his
simplest
questions
any
personal
obligation
i
meant
had
the
other
fellow
done
him
a
good
turn
any
time
no
i
do
imagine
them
to
have
had
any
previous
relations
at
all
his
stared
where
your
trouble
then
he
sat
for
a
moment
frowning
at
the
embers
even
when
it
the
other
way
round
it
ai
always
so
easy
to
decide
how
far
that
kind
of
thing
binding
and
they
say
shipwrecked
fellows
make
a
meal
of
friend
as
quick
as
they
would
of
a
total
stranger
he
drew
himself
together
with
a
shake
of
his
shoulders
and
pulled
back
his
feet
from
the
grate
but
i
see
the
conundrum
in
your
case
i
guess
it
up
to
both
parties
to
take
care
of
their
own
skins
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
wandered
upstairs
to
undine
that
was
the
wall
street
code
it
all
boiled
down
to
the
personal
obligation
to
the
salt
eaten
in
the
enemy
tent
ralph
fancy
wandered
off
on
a
long
trail
of
speculation
from
which
he
was
pulled
back
with
a
jerk
by
the
need
of
immediate
action
moffatt
deal
could
not
wait
quick
decisions
were
essential
to
effective
action
and
brooding
over
ethical
shades
of
difference
might
work
more
ill
than
good
in
a
world
committed
to
swift
adjustments
the
arrival
of
several
unforeseen
bills
confirmed
this
view
and
once
ralph
had
adopted
it
he
began
to
take
a
detached
interest
in
the
affair
in
paris
in
his
younger
days
he
had
once
attended
a
lesson
in
acting
given
at
the
conservatoire
by
one
of
the
great
lights
of
the
theatre
and
had
seen
an
apparently
uncomplicated
role
of
the
classic
repertory
familiar
to
him
through
repeated
performances
taken
to
pieces
before
his
eyes
dissolved
into
its
component
elements
and
built
up
again
with
a
minuteness
of
elucidation
and
a
range
of
reference
that
made
him
feel
as
though
he
had
been
let
into
the
secret
of
some
natural
process
as
he
listened
to
moffatt
the
remembrance
of
that
lesson
came
back
to
him
at
the
outset
the
deal
and
his
own
share
in
it
had
seemed
simple
enough
he
would
have
put
on
his
hat
and
gone
out
on
the
spot
in
the
full
assurance
of
being
able
to
transact
the
affair
but
as
moffatt
talked
he
began
to
feel
as
blank
and
blundering
as
the
class
of
dramatic
students
before
whom
the
great
actor
had
analyzed
his
part
the
affair
was
in
fact
difficult
and
complex
and
moffatt
saw
at
once
just
where
the
difficulties
lay
and
how
the
personal
idiosyncrasies
of
the
parties
affected
them
such
insight
fascinated
ralph
and
he
strayed
off
into
wondering
why
it
did
not
qualify
every
financier
to
be
a
novelist
and
what
intrinsic
barrier
divided
the
two
arts
both
men
had
strong
incentives
for
hastening
the
affair
and
within
a
fortnight
after
moffatt
first
advance
ralph
was
able
to
tell
him
that
his
offer
was
accepted
over
and
above
his
personal
satisfaction
he
felt
the
thrill
of
the
agent
whom
some
powerful
negotiator
has
charged
with
a
delicate
mission
he
might
have
been
an
eager
young
jesuit
carrying
compromising
papers
to
his
superior
it
had
been
stimulating
to
work
with
moffatt
and
to
study
at
close
range
the
large
powerful
instrument
of
his
intelligence
as
he
came
out
of
moffatt
office
at
the
conclusion
of
this
visit
ralph
met
spragg
descending
from
his
eyrie
he
stopped
short
with
a
backward
glance
at
moffatt
door
hallo
what
were
you
doing
in
there
with
those
ralph
judged
discretion
to
be
essential
oh
just
a
little
business
for
the
firm
spragg
said
no
more
but
resorted
to
the
soothing
labial
motion
of
revolving
his
phantom
toothpick
how
undie
getting
along
he
merely
asked
as
he
and
his
descended
together
in
the
elevator
she
does
seem
to
feel
much
stronger
the
doctor
wants
her
to
run
over
to
europe
for
a
few
weeks
she
thinks
of
joining
her
friends
the
shallums
in
paris
spragg
was
again
silent
but
he
left
the
building
at
ralph
side
and
the
two
walked
along
together
toward
wall
street
presently
the
older
man
asked
how
did
you
get
acquainted
with
moffatt
why
by
chance
undine
ran
across
him
somewhere
and
asked
him
to
dine
the
other
night
undine
asked
him
to
dine
yes
she
told
me
you
used
to
know
him
out
at
apex
spragg
appeared
to
search
his
memory
for
confirmation
of
the
fact
i
believe
he
used
to
be
round
there
at
one
time
i
never
heard
any
good
of
him
yet
he
paused
at
a
crossing
and
looked
probingly
at
his
is
she
terribly
set
on
this
trip
to
europe
ralph
smiled
you
know
how
it
is
when
she
takes
a
fancy
to
do
anything
spragg
by
a
slight
lift
of
his
brooding
brows
seemed
to
convey
a
deep
if
unspoken
response
well
i
let
her
do
it
this
time
i
let
her
do
it
he
said
as
he
turned
down
the
steps
of
the
subway
ralph
was
surprised
for
he
had
gathered
from
some
frightened
references
of
spragg
that
undine
parents
had
wind
of
her
european
plan
and
were
strongly
opposed
to
it
he
concluded
that
spragg
had
long
since
measured
the
extent
of
profitable
resistance
and
knew
just
when
it
became
vain
to
hold
out
against
his
daughter
or
advise
others
to
do
so
ralph
for
his
own
part
had
no
inclination
to
resist
as
he
left
moffatt
office
his
inmost
feeling
was
one
of
relief
he
had
reached
the
point
of
recognizing
that
it
was
best
for
both
that
his
wife
should
go
when
she
returned
perhaps
their
lives
would
readjust
themselves
but
for
the
moment
he
longed
for
some
kind
of
benumbing
influence
something
that
should
give
relief
to
the
dull
daily
ache
of
feeling
her
so
near
and
yet
so
inaccessible
certainly
there
were
more
urgent
uses
for
their
brilliant
heavy
arrears
of
household
debts
had
to
be
met
and
the
summer
would
bring
its
own
burden
but
perhaps
another
stroke
of
luck
might
befall
him
he
was
getting
to
have
the
drifting
dependence
on
luck
of
the
man
conscious
of
his
inability
to
direct
his
life
and
meanwhile
it
seemed
easier
to
let
undine
have
what
she
wanted
undine
on
the
whole
behaved
with
discretion
she
received
the
good
news
languidly
and
showed
no
unseemly
haste
to
profit
by
it
but
it
was
as
hard
to
hide
the
light
in
her
eyes
as
to
dissemble
the
fact
that
she
had
not
only
thought
out
every
detail
of
the
trip
in
advance
but
had
decided
exactly
how
her
husband
and
son
were
to
be
disposed
of
in
her
absence
her
suggestion
that
ralph
should
take
paul
to
his
grandparents
and
that
the
west
end
avenue
house
should
be
let
for
the
summer
was
too
practical
not
to
be
acted
on
and
ralph
found
she
had
already
put
her
hand
on
the
harry
lipscombs
who
after
three
years
of
neglect
were
to
be
dragged
back
to
favour
and
made
to
feel
as
the
first
step
in
their
reinstatement
the
necessity
of
hiring
for
the
summer
months
a
cool
airy
house
on
the
west
side
on
her
return
from
europe
undine
explained
she
would
of
course
go
straight
to
ralph
and
the
boy
in
the
adirondacks
and
it
seemed
a
foolish
extravagance
to
let
the
house
stand
empty
when
the
lipscombs
were
so
eager
to
take
it
as
the
day
of
departure
approached
it
became
harder
for
her
to
temper
her
beams
but
her
pleasure
showed
itself
so
amiably
that
ralph
began
to
think
she
might
after
all
miss
the
boy
and
himself
more
than
she
imagined
she
was
tenderly
preoccupied
with
paul
welfare
and
to
prepare
for
his
translation
to
his
grandparents
she
gave
the
household
in
washington
square
more
of
her
time
than
she
had
accorded
it
since
her
marriage
she
explained
that
she
wanted
paul
to
grow
used
to
his
new
surroundings
and
with
that
object
she
took
him
frequently
to
his
grandmother
and
won
her
way
into
old
dagonet
sympathies
by
her
devotion
to
the
child
and
her
pretty
way
of
joining
in
his
games
undine
was
not
consciously
acting
a
part
this
new
phase
was
as
natural
to
her
as
the
other
in
the
joy
of
her
gratified
desires
she
wanted
to
make
everybody
about
her
happy
if
only
everyone
would
do
as
she
wished
she
would
never
be
unreasonable
she
much
preferred
to
see
smiling
faces
about
her
and
her
dread
of
the
reproachful
and
dissatisfied
countenance
gave
the
measure
of
what
she
would
do
to
avoid
it
these
thoughts
were
in
her
mind
when
a
day
or
two
before
sailing
she
came
out
of
the
washington
square
house
with
her
boy
it
was
a
late
spring
afternoon
and
she
and
paul
had
lingered
on
till
long
past
the
hour
sacred
to
his
grandfather
nap
now
as
she
came
out
into
the
square
she
saw
that
however
well
dagonet
had
borne
their
protracted
romp
it
had
left
his
playmate
flushed
and
sleepy
and
she
lifted
paul
in
her
arms
to
carry
him
to
the
nearest
as
she
raised
herself
she
saw
a
figure
approaching
her
across
the
square
and
a
moment
later
she
was
shaking
hands
with
elmer
moffatt
in
the
bright
spring
air
he
looked
seasonably
glossy
and
prosperous
and
she
noticed
that
he
wore
a
bunch
of
violets
in
his
buttonhole
his
small
black
eyes
twinkled
with
approval
as
they
rested
on
her
and
undine
reflected
that
with
paul
arms
about
her
neck
and
his
little
flushed
face
against
her
own
she
must
present
a
not
unpleasing
image
of
young
motherhood
that
the
heir
apparent
moffatt
asked
adding
happy
to
make
your
acquaintance
sir
as
the
boy
at
undine
bidding
held
out
a
fist
sticky
with
sugarplums
he
been
spending
the
afternoon
with
his
grandfather
and
they
played
so
hard
that
he
sleepy
she
explained
little
paul
at
that
stage
in
his
career
had
a
peculiar
grace
of
eyes
and
arched
cherubic
lips
and
undine
saw
that
moffatt
was
not
insensible
to
the
picture
she
and
her
son
composed
she
did
not
dislike
his
admiration
for
she
no
longer
felt
any
shrinking
from
him
she
would
even
have
been
glad
to
thank
him
for
the
service
he
had
done
her
husband
if
she
had
known
how
to
allude
to
it
without
awkwardness
moffatt
seemed
equally
pleased
at
the
meeting
and
they
looked
at
each
other
almost
intimately
over
paul
tumbled
curls
he
a
mighty
fine
fellow
and
no
mistake
but
is
he
rather
an
armful
for
you
moffatt
asked
his
eyes
lingering
with
real
kindliness
on
the
child
face
oh
we
have
far
to
go
i
pick
up
a
cab
at
the
corner
well
let
me
carry
him
that
far
anyhow
said
moffatt
undine
was
glad
to
be
relieved
of
her
burden
for
she
was
unused
to
the
child
weight
and
disliked
to
feel
that
her
skirt
was
dragging
on
the
pavement
go
to
the
gentleman
pauly
he
carry
you
better
than
mother
she
said
the
little
boy
first
movement
was
one
of
recoil
from
the
ruddy
countenance
that
was
so
unlike
his
father
delicate
face
but
he
was
an
obedient
child
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
he
wound
his
arms
trustfully
about
the
red
gentleman
neck
that
a
good
fellow
sit
tight
and
i
give
you
a
ride
moffatt
cried
hoisting
the
boy
to
his
shoulder
paul
was
not
used
to
being
perched
at
such
a
height
and
his
nature
was
hospitable
to
new
impressions
oh
i
like
it
up
here
you
higher
than
father
he
exclaimed
and
moffatt
hugged
him
with
a
laugh
it
must
feel
mighty
good
to
come
uptown
to
a
fellow
like
you
in
the
evenings
he
said
addressing
the
child
but
looking
at
undine
who
also
laughed
a
little
oh
they
a
dreadful
nuisance
you
know
but
paul
a
very
good
boy
i
wonder
if
he
knows
what
a
friend
i
been
to
him
lately
moffatt
went
on
as
they
turned
into
fifth
avenue
undine
smiled
she
was
glad
he
should
have
given
her
an
opening
he
shall
be
told
as
soon
as
he
old
enough
to
thank
you
i
so
glad
you
came
to
ralph
about
that
business
oh
i
gave
him
a
leg
up
and
i
guess
he
given
me
one
too
queer
the
way
things
come
round
he
fairly
put
me
in
the
way
of
a
fresh
start
their
eyes
met
in
a
silence
which
undine
was
the
first
to
break
been
awfully
nice
of
you
to
do
what
you
done
right
along
and
this
last
thing
has
made
a
lot
of
difference
to
us
well
i
glad
you
feel
that
way
i
never
wanted
to
be
anything
but
as
you
call
it
moffatt
paused
a
moment
and
then
added
if
you
less
scared
of
me
than
your
father
is
i
be
glad
to
call
round
and
see
you
once
in
a
while
the
quick
blood
rushed
to
her
cheeks
there
was
nothing
challenging
demanding
in
his
tone
she
guessed
at
once
that
if
he
made
the
request
it
was
simply
for
the
pleasure
of
being
with
her
and
she
liked
the
magnanimity
implied
nevertheless
she
was
not
sorry
to
have
to
answer
of
course
i
always
be
glad
to
see
you
only
as
it
happens
i
just
sailing
for
europe
for
europe
the
word
brought
moffatt
to
a
stand
so
abruptly
that
little
paul
lurched
on
his
shoulder
for
europe
he
repeated
why
i
thought
you
said
the
other
evening
you
expected
to
stay
on
in
town
till
july
did
you
think
of
going
to
the
adirondacks
flattered
by
his
evident
disappointment
she
became
high
and
careless
in
her
triumph
oh
yes
but
that
all
changed
ralph
and
the
boy
are
going
but
i
sail
on
saturday
to
join
some
friends
in
paris
and
later
i
may
do
some
motoring
in
switzerland
an
italy
she
laughed
a
little
in
the
mere
enjoyment
of
putting
her
plans
into
words
and
moffatt
laughed
too
but
with
an
edge
of
sarcasm
i
see
i
see
everything
changed
as
you
say
and
your
husband
can
blow
you
off
to
the
trip
well
i
hope
you
have
a
time
their
glances
crossed
again
and
something
in
his
cool
scrutiny
impelled
undine
to
say
with
a
burst
of
candour
if
i
do
you
know
i
shall
owe
it
all
to
you
well
i
always
told
you
i
meant
to
act
white
by
you
he
answered
they
walked
on
in
silence
and
presently
he
began
again
in
his
usual
joking
strain
see
what
one
of
the
apex
girls
has
been
up
to
apex
was
too
remote
for
her
to
understand
the
reference
and
he
went
on
why
millard
binch
wife
indiana
frusk
that
was
did
you
see
in
the
papers
that
indiana
fixed
it
up
with
james
rolliver
to
marry
her
they
say
it
was
easy
enough
squaring
millard
binch
you
know
it
would
be
but
it
cost
roliver
near
a
million
to
mislay
and
the
children
well
indiana
pulled
it
off
anyhow
she
always
was
a
bright
girl
but
she
never
came
up
to
you
oh
she
stammered
with
a
laugh
astonished
and
agitated
by
his
news
indiana
frusk
and
rolliver
it
showed
how
easily
the
thing
could
be
done
if
only
her
father
had
listened
to
her
if
a
girl
like
indiana
frusk
could
gain
her
end
so
easily
what
might
not
undine
have
accomplished
she
knew
moffatt
was
right
in
saying
that
indiana
had
never
come
up
to
her
she
wondered
how
the
marriage
would
strike
van
degen
she
signalled
to
a
cab
and
they
walked
toward
it
without
speaking
undine
was
recalling
with
intensity
that
one
of
indiana
shoulders
was
higher
than
the
other
and
that
people
in
apex
had
thought
her
lucky
to
catch
millard
binch
the
druggist
clerk
when
undine
herself
had
cast
him
off
after
a
lingering
engagement
and
now
indiana
frusk
was
to
be
james
rolliver
undine
got
into
the
cab
and
bent
forward
to
take
little
paul
moffatt
lowered
his
charge
with
exaggerated
care
and
a
steady
there
steady
that
made
the
child
laugh
then
stooping
over
he
put
a
kiss
on
paul
lips
before
handing
him
over
to
his
mother
xix
the
parisian
diamond
company
branch
charles
bowen
seated
one
rainy
evening
of
the
paris
season
in
a
corner
of
the
great
nouveau
luxe
restaurant
was
lazily
trying
to
resolve
his
impressions
of
the
scene
into
the
phrases
of
a
letter
to
his
old
friend
henley
fairford
the
long
habit
of
unwritten
communion
with
this
lady
in
no
way
conditioned
by
the
short
rare
letters
they
actually
exchanged
usually
caused
his
notations
in
absence
to
fall
into
such
terms
when
the
subject
was
of
a
kind
to
strike
an
answering
flash
from
her
and
who
but
fairford
would
see
from
his
own
precise
angle
the
fantastic
improbability
the
layers
on
layers
of
unsubstantialness
on
which
the
seemingly
solid
scene
before
him
rested
the
of
the
nouveau
luxe
was
at
its
fullest
and
having
contracted
on
the
garden
side
through
stress
of
weather
had
even
overflowed
to
the
farther
end
of
the
long
hall
beyond
so
that
bowen
from
his
corner
surveyed
a
seemingly
endless
perspective
of
plumed
and
jewelled
heads
of
shoulders
bare
or
encircling
the
tables
he
had
come
half
an
hour
before
the
time
he
had
named
to
his
expected
guest
so
that
he
might
have
the
undisturbed
amusement
of
watching
the
picture
compose
itself
again
before
his
eyes
during
some
forty
years
perpetual
exercise
of
his
perceptions
he
had
never
come
across
anything
that
gave
them
the
special
titillation
produced
by
the
sight
of
the
at
the
nouveau
luxe
the
same
sense
of
putting
his
hand
on
human
nature
passion
for
the
factitious
its
incorrigible
habit
of
imitating
the
imitation
as
he
sat
watching
the
familiar
faces
swept
toward
him
on
the
rising
tide
of
arrival
for
it
was
one
of
the
joys
of
the
scene
that
the
type
was
always
the
same
even
when
the
individual
was
not
he
hailed
with
renewed
appreciation
this
costly
expression
of
a
social
ideal
the
at
the
nouveau
luxe
represented
on
such
a
spring
evening
what
unbounded
material
power
had
devised
for
the
delusion
of
its
leisure
a
phantom
society
with
all
the
rules
smirks
gestures
of
its
model
but
evoked
out
of
promiscuity
and
incoherence
while
the
other
had
been
the
product
of
continuity
and
choice
and
the
instinct
which
had
driven
a
new
class
of
to
bind
themselves
to
slavish
imitation
of
the
superseded
and
their
prompt
and
reverent
faith
in
the
reality
of
the
sham
they
had
created
seemed
to
bowen
the
most
satisfying
proof
of
human
permanence
with
this
thought
in
his
mind
he
looked
up
to
greet
his
guest
the
comte
raymond
de
chelles
straight
slim
and
gravely
smiling
came
toward
him
with
frequent
pauses
of
salutation
at
the
crowded
tables
saying
as
he
seated
himself
and
turned
his
pleasant
eyes
on
the
scene
il
a
pas
à
dire
my
dear
bowen
it
charming
and
sympathetic
and
original
we
owe
america
a
debt
of
gratitude
for
inventing
it
bowen
felt
a
last
touch
of
satisfaction
they
were
the
very
words
to
complete
his
thought
my
dear
fellow
it
really
you
and
your
kind
who
are
responsible
the
direct
creation
of
feudalism
like
all
the
great
social
upheavals
raymond
de
chelles
stroked
his
handsome
brown
moustache
i
should
have
said
on
the
contrary
that
one
enjoyed
it
for
the
contrast
it
such
a
refreshing
change
from
our
institutions
which
are
nevertheless
the
necessary
foundations
of
society
but
just
as
one
may
have
an
infinite
admiration
for
one
wife
and
yet
occasionally
he
waved
a
light
hand
toward
the
spectacle
this
in
the
social
order
is
the
diversion
the
permitted
diversion
that
your
original
race
has
devised
a
kind
of
superior
bohemia
where
one
may
be
respectable
without
being
bored
bowen
laughed
you
put
it
in
a
nutshell
the
ideal
of
the
american
woman
is
to
be
respectable
without
being
bored
and
from
that
point
of
view
this
world
they
invented
has
more
originality
than
i
gave
it
credit
for
chelles
thoughtfully
unfolded
his
napkin
my
impression
a
superficial
one
of
course
for
as
to
what
goes
on
underneath
he
looked
across
the
room
if
i
married
i
should
care
to
have
my
wife
come
here
too
often
bowen
laughed
again
she
be
as
safe
as
in
a
bank
nothing
ever
goes
on
nothing
that
ever
happens
here
is
real
ah
quant
à
cela
the
frenchman
murmured
inserting
a
fork
into
his
melon
bowen
looked
at
him
with
enjoyment
he
was
such
a
precious
to
the
page
the
two
men
accidentally
thrown
together
some
years
previously
during
a
trip
up
the
nile
always
met
again
with
pleasure
when
bowen
returned
to
france
raymond
de
chelles
who
came
of
a
family
of
moderate
fortune
lived
for
the
greater
part
of
the
year
on
his
father
estates
in
burgundy
but
he
came
up
every
spring
to
the
entresol
of
the
old
marquis
hotel
for
a
two
months
study
of
human
nature
applying
to
the
pursuit
the
discriminating
taste
and
transient
ardour
that
give
the
finest
bloom
to
pleasure
bowen
liked
him
as
a
companion
and
admired
him
as
a
charming
specimen
of
the
frenchman
of
his
class
embodying
in
his
lean
fatigued
and
finished
person
that
happy
mean
of
simplicity
and
intelligence
of
which
no
other
race
has
found
the
secret
if
raymond
de
chelles
had
been
english
he
would
have
been
a
mere
animal
with
appetites
but
without
tastes
but
in
his
lighter
gallic
clay
the
wholesome
territorial
savour
the
inherited
passion
for
sport
and
agriculture
were
blent
with
an
openness
to
finer
sensations
a
sense
of
the
of
ideas
under
which
one
felt
the
tight
hold
of
two
or
three
inherited
notions
religious
political
and
domestic
in
total
contradiction
to
his
surface
attitude
that
the
inherited
notions
would
in
the
end
prevail
everything
in
his
appearance
declared
from
the
distinguished
slant
of
his
nose
to
the
narrow
forehead
under
his
thinning
hair
he
was
the
kind
of
man
who
would
inevitably
revert
when
he
married
but
meanwhile
the
surface
he
presented
to
the
play
of
life
was
broad
enough
to
take
in
the
fantastic
spectacle
of
the
nouveau
luxe
and
to
see
its
gestures
reflected
in
a
latin
consciousness
was
an
endless
entertainment
to
bowen
the
tone
of
his
guest
last
words
made
him
take
them
up
but
is
the
lady
you
allude
to
more
than
a
hypothesis
surely
you
not
thinking
of
getting
married
chelles
raised
his
ironically
when
has
one
to
think
of
it
in
my
situation
one
hears
of
nothing
else
at
home
one
knows
that
like
death
it
has
to
come
his
glance
which
was
still
mustering
the
room
came
to
a
sudden
pause
and
kindled
who
the
lady
over
there
in
white
the
one
who
just
come
in
with
the
man
they
seem
to
be
with
a
party
of
your
compatriots
bowen
followed
his
glance
to
a
neighbouring
table
where
at
the
moment
undine
marvell
was
seating
herself
at
peter
van
degen
side
in
the
company
of
the
harvey
shallums
the
beautiful
beringer
and
a
dozen
other
new
york
figures
she
was
so
placed
that
as
she
took
her
seat
she
recognized
bowen
and
sent
him
a
smile
across
the
tables
she
was
more
simply
dressed
than
usual
and
the
pink
lights
warming
her
cheeks
and
striking
gleams
from
her
hair
gave
her
face
a
dewy
freshness
that
was
new
to
bowen
he
had
always
thought
her
beauty
too
obvious
too
bathed
in
the
bright
publicity
of
the
american
air
but
she
seemed
to
have
been
brushed
by
the
wing
of
poetry
and
its
shadow
lingered
in
her
eyes
chelles
gaze
made
it
evident
that
he
had
received
the
same
impression
one
is
sometimes
inclined
to
deny
your
compatriots
actual
beauty
to
charge
them
with
producing
the
effect
without
having
the
features
but
in
this
case
you
say
you
know
the
lady
yes
she
the
wife
of
an
old
friend
the
wife
she
married
there
again
it
so
puzzling
your
young
girls
look
so
experienced
and
your
married
women
sometimes
so
unmarried
well
they
often
are
in
these
days
of
divorce
the
other
interest
quickened
your
friend
divorced
oh
no
heaven
forbid
marvell
has
been
long
married
and
it
was
a
of
the
good
old
kind
ah
and
the
husband
which
is
he
he
not
here
he
in
new
york
feverishly
adding
to
a
fortune
already
monstrous
no
not
precisely
monstrous
the
marvells
are
not
well
off
said
bowen
amused
by
his
friend
interrogations
and
he
allows
an
exquisite
being
like
that
to
come
to
paris
without
him
and
in
company
with
the
gentleman
who
seems
so
alive
to
his
advantages
we
do
our
women
this
or
that
i
do
think
we
set
much
store
by
the
compulsory
virtues
his
companion
received
this
with
amusement
if
you
as
detached
as
that
why
does
the
obsolete
institution
of
marriage
survive
with
you
oh
it
still
has
its
uses
one
could
be
divorced
without
it
chelles
laughed
again
but
his
straying
eye
still
followed
the
same
direction
and
bowen
noticed
that
the
fact
was
not
unremarked
by
the
object
of
his
contemplation
undine
party
was
one
of
the
liveliest
in
the
room
the
american
laugh
rose
above
the
din
of
the
orchestra
as
the
american
toilets
dominated
the
less
daring
effects
at
the
other
tables
undine
on
entering
had
seemed
to
be
in
the
same
mood
as
her
companions
but
bowen
saw
that
as
she
became
conscious
of
his
observation
she
isolated
herself
in
a
kind
of
soft
abstraction
and
he
admired
the
adaptability
which
enabled
her
to
draw
from
such
surroundings
the
contrasting
graces
of
reserve
they
had
greeted
each
other
with
all
the
outer
signs
of
cordiality
but
bowen
fancied
she
would
not
care
to
have
him
speak
to
her
she
was
evidently
dining
with
van
degen
and
van
degen
proximity
was
the
last
fact
she
would
wish
to
have
transmitted
to
the
critics
in
washington
square
bowen
was
therefore
surprised
when
as
he
rose
to
leave
the
restaurant
he
heard
himself
hailed
by
peter
hallo
hold
on
when
did
you
come
over
marvell
dying
for
the
last
news
about
the
old
homestead
undine
smile
confirmed
the
appeal
she
wanted
to
know
how
lately
bowen
had
left
new
york
and
pressed
him
to
tell
her
when
he
had
last
seen
her
boy
how
he
was
looking
and
whether
ralph
had
been
persuaded
to
go
down
to
clare
on
saturdays
and
get
a
little
riding
and
tennis
and
dear
laura
was
she
well
too
and
was
paul
with
her
or
still
with
his
grandmother
they
were
all
dreadfully
bad
correspondents
and
so
was
she
undine
laughingly
admitted
and
when
ralph
had
last
written
her
these
questions
had
still
been
undecided
as
she
smiled
up
at
bowen
he
saw
her
glance
stray
to
the
spot
where
his
companion
hovered
and
when
the
diners
rose
to
move
toward
the
garden
for
coffee
she
said
with
a
sweet
note
and
a
detaining
smile
do
come
with
us
i
have
half
finished
van
degen
echoed
the
request
and
bowen
amused
by
undine
arts
was
presently
introducing
chelles
and
joining
with
him
in
the
transit
to
the
terrace
the
rain
had
ceased
and
under
the
clear
evening
sky
the
restaurant
garden
opened
green
depths
that
skilfully
hid
its
narrow
boundaries
van
degen
company
was
large
enough
to
surround
two
of
the
tables
on
the
terrace
and
bowen
noted
the
skill
with
which
undine
leaving
him
to
shallum
care
contrived
to
draw
raymond
de
chelles
to
the
other
table
still
more
noticeable
was
the
effect
of
this
stratagem
on
van
degen
who
also
found
himself
relegated
to
shallum
group
poor
peter
state
was
betrayed
by
the
irascibility
which
wreaked
itself
on
a
jostling
waiter
and
found
cause
for
loud
remonstrance
in
the
coldness
of
the
coffee
and
the
badness
of
the
cigars
and
bowen
with
something
more
than
the
curiosity
of
the
wondered
whether
this
were
the
real
clue
to
undine
conduct
he
had
always
smiled
at
fairford
fears
for
ralph
domestic
peace
he
thought
undine
too
to
forfeit
the
advantages
of
her
marriage
but
it
now
struck
him
that
she
might
have
had
a
glimpse
of
larger
opportunities
bowen
at
the
thought
felt
the
pang
of
the
sociologist
over
the
individual
havoc
wrought
by
every
social
readjustment
it
had
so
long
been
clear
to
him
that
poor
ralph
was
a
survival
and
destined
as
such
to
go
down
in
any
conflict
with
the
rising
forces
xx
some
six
weeks
later
undine
marvell
stood
at
the
window
smiling
down
on
her
recovered
paris
her
hotel
had
as
usual
been
flowered
cushioned
and
into
a
delusive
semblance
of
stability
and
she
had
really
felt
for
the
last
few
weeks
that
the
life
she
was
leading
there
must
be
going
to
last
it
seemed
so
perfect
an
answer
to
all
her
wants
as
she
looked
out
at
the
thronged
street
on
which
the
summer
light
lay
like
a
blush
of
pleasure
she
felt
herself
naturally
akin
to
all
the
bright
and
careless
freedom
of
the
scene
she
had
been
away
from
paris
for
two
days
and
the
spectacle
before
her
seemed
more
rich
and
suggestive
after
her
brief
absence
from
it
her
senses
luxuriated
in
all
its
material
details
the
thronging
motors
the
brilliant
shops
the
novelty
and
daring
of
the
women
dresses
the
colours
of
the
ambulant
the
appetizing
expanse
of
the
windows
even
the
chromatic
effects
of
the
petits
fours
behind
the
of
the
all
the
and
variety
of
the
inexhaustible
streets
of
paris
the
scene
before
her
typified
to
undine
her
first
real
taste
of
life
how
meagre
and
starved
the
past
appeared
in
comparison
with
this
abundant
present
the
noise
the
crowd
the
promiscuity
beneath
her
eyes
symbolized
the
glare
and
movement
of
her
life
every
moment
of
her
days
was
packed
with
excitement
and
exhilaration
everything
amused
her
the
long
hours
of
bargaining
and
debate
with
and
jewellers
the
crowded
lunches
at
fashionable
restaurants
the
perfunctory
dash
through
a
or
the
lingering
visit
to
the
last
new
milliner
the
afternoon
to
some
leafy
suburb
where
tea
and
musics
and
sunset
were
hastily
absorbed
on
a
crowded
terrace
above
the
seine
the
whirl
home
through
the
bois
to
dress
for
dinner
and
start
again
on
the
round
of
evening
diversions
the
dinner
at
the
nouveau
luxe
or
the
café
de
paris
and
the
little
play
at
the
capucines
or
the
variétés
followed
because
the
night
was
too
lovely
and
it
was
a
shame
to
waste
it
by
a
breathless
flight
back
to
the
bois
with
supper
in
one
of
its
restaurants
or
if
the
weather
forbade
a
tumultuous
progress
through
the
midnight
haunts
where
ladies
were
not
supposed
to
show
themselves
and
might
consequently
taste
the
thrill
of
being
occasionally
taken
for
their
opposites
as
the
varied
vision
unrolled
itself
undine
contrasted
it
with
the
pale
monotony
of
her
previous
summers
the
one
she
most
resented
was
the
first
after
her
marriage
the
european
summer
out
of
whose
joys
she
had
been
cheated
by
her
own
ignorance
and
ralph
perversity
they
had
been
free
then
there
had
been
no
child
to
hamper
their
movements
their
money
anxieties
had
hardly
begun
the
face
of
life
had
been
fresh
and
radiant
and
she
had
been
doomed
to
waste
such
opportunities
on
a
succession
of
italian
towns
she
still
felt
it
to
be
her
deepest
grievance
against
her
husband
and
now
that
after
four
years
of
petty
household
worries
another
chance
of
escape
had
come
he
already
wanted
to
drag
her
back
to
bondage
this
fit
of
retrospection
had
been
provoked
by
two
letters
which
had
come
that
morning
one
was
from
ralph
who
began
by
reminding
her
that
he
had
not
heard
from
her
for
weeks
and
went
on
to
point
out
in
his
usual
tone
of
remonstrance
that
since
her
departure
the
drain
on
her
letter
of
credit
had
been
deep
and
constant
i
wanted
you
he
wrote
to
get
all
the
fun
you
could
out
of
the
money
i
made
last
spring
but
i
did
think
you
get
through
it
quite
so
fast
try
to
come
home
without
leaving
too
many
bills
behind
you
your
illness
and
paul
cost
more
than
i
expected
and
lipscomb
has
had
a
bad
knock
in
wall
street
and
has
yet
paid
his
first
quarter
always
the
same
monotonous
refrain
was
it
her
fault
that
she
and
the
boy
had
been
ill
or
that
harry
lipscomb
had
been
on
the
wrong
side
of
wall
street
ralph
seemed
to
have
money
on
the
brain
his
business
life
had
certainly
deteriorated
him
and
since
he
had
made
a
success
of
it
after
all
why
should
he
turn
back
to
literature
and
try
to
write
his
novel
undine
the
previous
winter
had
been
dazzled
by
the
figures
which
a
magazine
editor
whom
she
had
met
at
dinner
had
named
as
within
reach
of
the
successful
novelist
she
perceived
for
the
first
time
that
literature
was
becoming
fashionable
and
instantly
decided
that
it
would
be
amusing
and
original
if
she
and
ralph
should
owe
their
prosperity
to
his
talent
she
already
saw
herself
as
the
wife
of
a
celebrated
author
wearing
artistic
dresses
and
doing
the
over
with
gothic
tapestries
and
dim
lights
in
altar
but
when
she
suggested
ralph
taking
up
his
novel
he
answered
with
a
laugh
that
his
brains
were
sold
to
the
firm
that
when
he
came
back
at
night
the
tank
was
empty
and
now
he
wanted
her
to
sail
for
home
in
a
week
the
other
letter
excited
a
deeper
resentment
it
was
an
appeal
from
laura
fairford
to
return
and
look
after
ralph
he
was
overworked
and
out
of
spirits
she
wrote
and
his
mother
and
sister
reluctant
as
they
were
to
interfere
felt
they
ought
to
urge
undine
to
come
back
to
him
details
followed
unwelcome
and
officious
what
right
had
laura
fairford
to
preach
to
her
of
wifely
obligations
no
doubt
charles
bowen
had
sent
home
a
report
and
there
was
really
a
certain
irony
in
fairford
criticizing
her
conduct
on
information
obtained
from
such
a
source
undine
turned
from
the
window
and
threw
herself
down
on
her
deeply
cushioned
sofa
she
was
feeling
the
pleasant
fatigue
consequent
on
her
trip
to
the
country
whither
she
and
shallum
had
gone
with
raymond
de
chelles
to
spend
a
night
at
the
old
marquis
chateau
when
her
travelling
companions
an
hour
earlier
had
left
her
at
her
door
she
had
to
rejoin
them
for
a
late
dinner
in
the
bois
and
as
she
leaned
back
among
the
cushions
disturbing
thoughts
were
banished
by
the
urgent
necessity
of
deciding
what
dress
she
should
wear
these
bright
weeks
of
the
parisian
spring
had
given
her
a
first
real
glimpse
into
the
art
of
living
from
the
experts
who
had
taught
her
to
subdue
the
curves
of
her
figure
and
soften
her
bright
free
stare
with
dusky
pencillings
to
the
skilled
purveyors
of
countless
forms
of
pleasure
the
theatres
and
restaurants
the
green
and
blossoming
suburbs
the
whole
shining
shifting
spectacle
of
nights
and
days
every
sight
and
sound
and
word
had
combined
to
charm
her
perceptions
and
refine
her
taste
and
her
growing
friendship
with
raymond
de
chelles
had
been
the
most
potent
of
these
influences
chelles
at
once
immensely
taken
had
not
only
shown
his
eagerness
to
share
in
the
motions
of
undine
party
but
had
given
her
glimpses
of
another
still
more
brilliant
existence
that
life
of
the
inaccessible
faubourg
of
which
the
first
tantalizing
hints
had
but
lately
reached
her
hitherto
she
had
assumed
that
paris
existed
for
the
stranger
that
its
native
life
was
merely
an
obscure
foundation
for
the
dazzling
superstructure
of
hotels
and
restaurants
in
which
her
compatriots
disported
themselves
but
lately
she
had
begun
to
hear
about
other
american
women
the
women
who
had
married
into
the
french
aristocracy
and
who
led
in
the
houses
beyond
the
seine
which
she
had
once
thought
so
dull
and
dingy
a
life
that
made
her
own
seem
as
undistinguished
as
the
social
existence
of
the
mealey
house
perhaps
what
most
exasperated
her
was
the
discovery
in
this
impenetrable
group
of
the
miss
wincher
who
had
poisoned
her
summer
at
potash
springs
to
recognize
her
old
enemy
in
the
marquise
de
trezac
who
so
frequently
figured
in
the
parisian
chronicle
was
the
more
irritating
to
undine
because
her
intervening
social
experiences
had
caused
her
to
look
back
on
nettie
wincher
as
a
frumpy
girl
who
have
had
a
show
in
new
york
once
more
all
the
accepted
values
were
reversed
and
it
turned
out
that
miss
wincher
had
been
in
possession
of
some
key
to
success
on
which
undine
had
not
yet
put
her
hand
to
know
that
others
were
indifferent
to
what
she
had
thought
important
was
to
cheapen
all
present
pleasure
and
turn
the
whole
force
of
her
desires
in
a
new
direction
what
she
wanted
for
the
moment
was
to
linger
on
in
paris
prolonging
her
flirtation
with
chelles
and
profiting
by
it
to
detach
herself
from
her
compatriots
and
enter
doors
closed
to
their
approach
and
chelles
himself
attracted
her
she
thought
him
as
sweet
as
she
had
once
thought
ralph
whose
fastidiousness
and
refinement
were
blent
in
him
with
a
delightful
foreign
vivacity
his
chief
value
however
lay
in
his
power
of
exciting
van
degen
jealousy
she
knew
enough
of
french
customs
to
be
aware
that
such
devotion
as
chelles
was
not
likely
to
have
much
practical
bearing
on
her
future
but
peter
had
an
alarming
way
of
lapsing
into
security
and
as
a
spur
to
his
ardour
she
knew
the
value
of
other
attentions
it
had
become
undine
fixed
purpose
to
bring
van
degen
to
a
definite
expression
of
his
intentions
the
case
of
indiana
frusk
whose
brilliant
marriage
the
journals
of
two
continents
had
recently
chronicled
with
unprecedented
richness
of
detail
had
made
less
impression
on
him
than
she
hoped
he
treated
it
as
a
comic
episode
without
special
bearing
on
their
case
and
once
when
undine
cited
rolliver
expensive
fight
for
freedom
as
an
instance
of
the
power
of
love
over
the
most
invulnerable
natures
had
answered
carelessly
oh
his
first
wife
was
a
laundress
i
believe
but
all
about
them
couples
were
unpairing
and
pairing
again
with
an
ease
and
rapidity
that
encouraged
undine
to
bide
her
time
it
was
simply
a
question
of
making
van
degen
want
her
enough
and
of
not
being
obliged
to
abandon
the
game
before
he
wanted
her
as
much
as
she
meant
he
should
this
was
precisely
what
would
happen
if
she
were
compelled
to
leave
paris
now
already
the
event
had
shown
how
right
she
had
been
to
come
abroad
the
attention
she
attracted
in
paris
had
reawakened
van
fancy
and
her
hold
over
him
was
stronger
than
when
they
had
parted
in
america
but
the
next
step
must
be
taken
with
coolness
and
circumspection
and
she
must
not
throw
away
what
she
had
gained
by
going
away
at
a
stage
when
he
was
surer
of
her
than
she
of
him
she
was
still
intensely
considering
these
questions
when
the
door
behind
her
opened
and
he
came
in
she
looked
up
with
a
frown
and
he
gave
a
deprecating
laugh
did
i
knock
do
look
so
savage
they
told
me
downstairs
you
got
back
and
i
just
bolted
in
without
thinking
he
had
widened
and
purpled
since
their
first
encounter
five
years
earlier
but
his
features
had
not
matured
his
face
was
still
the
face
of
a
covetous
bullying
boy
with
a
large
appetite
for
primitive
satisfactions
and
a
sturdy
belief
in
his
intrinsic
right
to
them
it
was
all
the
more
satisfying
to
undine
vanity
to
see
his
look
change
at
her
tone
from
command
to
conciliation
and
from
conciliation
to
the
entreaty
of
a
animal
what
a
ridiculous
hour
for
a
visit
she
exclaimed
ignoring
his
excuse
well
if
you
disappear
like
that
without
a
word
i
told
my
maid
to
telephone
you
i
was
going
away
you
could
make
time
to
do
it
yourself
i
suppose
we
rushed
off
suddenly
i
hardly
time
to
get
to
the
station
you
rushed
off
where
may
i
ask
van
degen
still
lowered
down
on
her
oh
did
i
tell
you
i
been
down
staying
at
chelles
chateau
in
burgundy
her
face
lit
up
and
she
raised
herself
eagerly
on
her
elbow
it
the
most
wonderful
old
house
you
ever
saw
a
real
castle
with
towers
and
water
all
round
it
and
a
funny
kind
of
bridge
they
pull
up
chelles
said
he
wanted
me
to
see
just
how
they
lived
at
home
and
i
did
i
saw
everything
the
tapestries
that
louis
quinze
gave
them
and
the
family
portraits
and
the
chapel
where
their
own
priest
says
mass
and
they
sit
by
themselves
in
a
balcony
with
crowns
all
over
it
the
priest
was
a
lovely
old
man
he
said
he
give
anything
to
convert
me
do
you
know
i
think
there
something
very
beautiful
about
the
roman
catholic
religion
i
often
felt
i
might
have
been
happier
if
i
had
some
religious
influence
in
my
life
she
sighed
a
little
and
turned
her
head
away
she
flattered
herself
that
she
had
learned
to
strike
the
right
note
with
van
degen
at
this
crucial
stage
he
needed
a
taste
of
his
own
methods
a
glimpse
of
the
fact
that
there
were
women
in
the
world
who
could
get
on
without
him
he
continued
to
gaze
down
at
her
sulkily
were
the
old
people
there
you
never
told
me
you
knew
his
mother
i
do
they
were
there
but
it
did
make
a
bit
of
difference
because
raymond
sent
down
a
cook
from
the
luxe
oh
lord
van
degen
groaned
dropping
down
on
the
end
of
the
sofa
was
the
cook
got
down
to
chaperon
you
undine
laughed
you
talk
like
ralph
i
had
bertha
with
me
bertha
his
tone
of
contempt
surprised
her
she
had
supposed
that
shallum
presence
had
made
the
visit
perfectly
correct
you
went
without
knowing
his
parents
and
without
their
inviting
you
do
you
know
what
that
sort
of
thing
means
out
here
chelles
did
it
to
brag
about
you
at
his
club
he
wants
to
compromise
you
that
his
game
do
you
suppose
he
does
a
flicker
of
a
smile
crossed
her
lips
so
unconventional
when
i
like
a
man
i
never
stop
to
think
about
such
things
but
i
ought
to
of
course
you
quite
right
she
looked
at
van
degen
thoughtfully
at
any
rate
he
not
a
married
man
van
degen
had
got
to
his
feet
again
and
was
standing
accusingly
before
her
but
as
she
spoke
the
blood
rose
to
his
neck
and
ears
what
difference
does
that
make
it
might
make
a
good
deal
i
see
she
added
how
careful
i
ought
to
be
about
going
round
with
you
with
me
his
face
fell
at
the
retort
then
he
broke
into
a
laugh
he
adored
undine
smartness
which
was
of
precisely
the
same
quality
as
his
own
oh
that
another
thing
you
can
always
trust
me
to
look
after
you
with
your
reputation
much
obliged
van
degen
smiled
she
knew
he
liked
such
allusions
and
was
pleased
that
she
thought
him
compromising
oh
i
as
good
as
gold
you
made
a
new
man
of
me
have
i
she
considered
him
in
silence
for
a
moment
i
wonder
what
you
done
to
me
but
make
a
discontented
woman
of
me
discontented
with
everything
i
had
before
i
knew
you
the
change
of
tone
was
thrilling
to
him
he
forgot
her
mockery
forgot
his
rival
and
sat
down
at
her
side
almost
in
possession
of
her
waist
look
here
he
asked
where
are
we
going
to
dine
his
nearness
was
not
agreeable
to
undine
but
she
liked
his
free
way
his
contempt
for
verbal
preliminaries
ralph
reserves
and
delicacies
his
perpetual
desire
that
he
and
she
should
be
attuned
to
the
same
key
had
always
vaguely
bored
her
whereas
in
van
degen
manner
she
felt
a
hint
of
the
masterful
way
that
had
once
subdued
her
in
elmer
moffatt
but
she
drew
back
releasing
herself
i
ca
i
engaged
i
know
you
are
engaged
to
me
you
promised
last
sunday
you
dine
with
me
out
of
town
how
can
i
remember
what
i
promised
last
sunday
besides
after
what
you
said
i
see
i
ought
to
what
do
you
mean
by
what
i
said
why
that
i
imprudent
that
people
are
talking
he
stood
up
with
an
angry
laugh
i
suppose
you
dining
with
chelles
is
that
it
is
that
the
way
you
clare
i
do
care
a
hang
what
clare
does
i
never
have
that
must
in
some
ways
be
rather
convenient
for
her
glad
you
think
so
are
you
dining
with
him
she
slowly
turned
the
upon
her
finger
you
know
i
not
married
to
you
yet
he
took
a
random
turn
through
the
room
then
he
came
back
and
planted
himself
wrathfully
before
her
ca
you
see
the
man
doing
his
best
to
make
a
fool
of
you
she
kept
her
amused
gaze
on
him
does
it
strike
you
that
it
such
an
awfully
easy
thing
to
do
the
edges
of
his
ears
were
purple
i
sometimes
think
it
easier
for
these
damned
little
than
for
one
of
us
undine
was
still
smiling
up
at
him
but
suddenly
her
grew
grave
what
does
it
matter
what
i
do
or
do
do
when
ralph
has
ordered
me
home
next
week
ordered
you
home
his
face
changed
well
you
not
going
are
you
what
the
use
of
saying
such
things
she
gave
a
disenchanted
laugh
i
a
poor
man
wife
and
ca
do
the
things
my
friends
do
it
not
because
ralph
loves
me
that
he
wants
me
back
it
simply
because
he
ca
afford
to
let
me
stay
van
degen
perturbation
was
increasing
but
you
must
go
preposterous
why
should
a
woman
like
you
be
sacrificed
when
a
lot
of
dreary
frumps
have
everything
they
want
besides
you
ca
chuck
me
like
this
why
we
all
to
motor
down
to
aix
next
week
and
perhaps
take
a
dip
into
italy
oh
italy
she
murmured
on
a
note
of
yearning
he
was
closer
now
and
had
her
hands
you
love
that
would
you
as
far
as
venice
anyhow
and
then
in
august
there
trouville
never
tried
trouville
there
an
awfully
jolly
crowd
there
and
the
motoring
ripping
in
normandy
if
you
say
so
i
take
a
villa
there
instead
of
going
back
to
newport
and
i
put
the
sorceress
in
commission
and
you
can
make
up
parties
and
run
off
whenever
you
like
to
scotland
or
norway
he
hung
above
her
do
dine
with
chelles
come
with
me
and
we
talk
things
over
and
next
week
run
down
to
trouville
to
choose
the
villa
undine
heart
was
beating
fast
but
she
felt
within
her
a
strange
lucid
force
of
resistance
because
of
that
sense
of
security
she
left
her
hands
in
van
degen
so
spragg
might
have
felt
at
the
tensest
hour
of
the
pure
water
move
she
leaned
forward
holding
her
suitor
off
by
the
pressure
of
her
palms
kiss
me
peter
i
sail
on
wednesday
she
said
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
permitted
him
a
kiss
and
as
his
face
darkened
down
on
her
she
felt
a
moment
recoil
but
her
physical
reactions
were
never
very
acute
she
always
vaguely
wondered
why
people
made
such
a
fuss
were
so
violently
for
or
against
such
demonstrations
a
cool
spirit
within
her
seemed
to
watch
over
and
regulate
her
sensations
and
leave
her
capable
of
measuring
the
intensity
of
those
she
provoked
she
turned
to
look
at
the
clock
you
must
go
now
i
shall
be
hours
late
for
dinner
go
after
that
he
held
her
fast
kiss
me
again
he
commanded
it
was
wonderful
how
cool
she
felt
how
easily
she
could
slip
out
of
his
grasp
any
man
could
be
managed
like
a
child
if
he
were
really
in
love
with
one
do
be
a
goose
peter
do
you
suppose
i
have
kissed
you
if
if
what
what
what
he
mimicked
her
ecstatically
not
listening
she
saw
that
if
she
wished
to
make
him
hear
her
she
must
put
more
distance
between
them
and
she
rose
and
moved
across
the
room
from
the
fireplace
she
turned
to
add
if
we
had
been
saying
now
what
the
use
of
talking
like
that
he
jumped
up
and
followed
her
look
here
undine
i
do
anything
on
earth
you
want
only
do
talk
of
going
if
you
only
stay
i
make
it
all
as
straight
and
square
as
you
please
i
get
bertha
shallum
to
stop
over
with
you
for
the
summer
i
take
a
house
at
trouville
and
make
my
wife
come
out
there
hang
it
she
shall
if
you
say
so
only
be
a
little
good
to
me
still
she
stood
before
him
without
speaking
aware
that
her
implacable
brows
and
narrowed
lips
would
hold
him
off
as
long
as
she
chose
what
the
matter
undine
why
do
you
answer
you
know
you
ca
go
back
to
that
deadly
she
swept
about
on
him
with
indignant
eyes
i
ca
go
on
with
my
present
life
either
it
hateful
as
hateful
as
the
other
if
i
go
home
i
got
to
decide
on
something
different
what
do
you
mean
by
different
she
was
silent
and
he
insisted
are
you
really
thinking
of
marrying
chelles
she
started
as
if
he
had
surprised
a
secret
i
never
forgive
you
if
you
speak
of
it
good
lord
good
lord
he
groaned
she
remained
motionless
with
lowered
lids
and
he
went
up
to
her
and
pulled
her
about
so
that
she
faced
him
undine
honour
bright
do
you
think
he
marry
you
she
looked
at
him
with
a
sudden
hardness
in
her
eyes
i
really
discuss
such
things
with
you
oh
for
the
lord
sake
do
take
that
tone
i
do
half
know
what
i
saying
but
you
must
throw
yourself
away
a
second
time
i
do
anything
you
want
i
swear
i
will
a
knock
on
the
door
sent
them
apart
and
a
servant
entered
with
a
telegram
undine
turned
away
to
the
window
with
the
narrow
blue
slip
she
was
glad
of
the
interruption
the
sense
of
what
she
had
at
stake
made
her
want
to
pause
a
moment
and
to
draw
breath
the
message
was
a
long
cable
signed
with
laura
fairford
name
it
told
her
that
ralph
had
been
taken
suddenly
ill
with
pneumonia
that
his
condition
was
serious
and
that
the
doctors
advised
his
wife
immediate
return
undine
had
to
read
the
words
over
two
or
three
times
to
get
them
into
her
crowded
mind
and
even
after
she
had
done
so
she
needed
more
time
to
see
their
bearing
on
her
own
situation
if
the
message
had
concerned
her
boy
her
brain
would
have
acted
more
quickly
she
had
never
troubled
herself
over
the
possibility
of
paul
falling
ill
in
her
absence
but
she
understood
now
that
if
the
cable
had
been
about
him
she
would
have
rushed
to
the
earliest
steamer
with
ralph
it
was
different
ralph
was
always
perfectly
well
she
could
not
picture
him
as
being
suddenly
at
death
door
and
in
need
of
her
probably
his
mother
and
sister
had
had
a
panic
they
were
always
full
of
sentimental
terrors
the
next
moment
an
angry
suspicion
flashed
across
her
what
if
the
cable
were
a
device
of
the
marvell
women
to
bring
her
back
perhaps
it
had
been
sent
with
ralph
connivance
no
doubt
bowen
had
written
home
about
her
washington
square
had
received
some
monstrous
report
of
her
doings
yes
the
cable
was
clearly
an
echo
of
laura
letter
mother
and
daughter
had
cooked
it
up
to
spoil
her
pleasure
once
the
thought
had
occurred
to
her
it
struck
root
in
her
mind
and
began
to
throw
out
giant
branches
van
degen
followed
her
to
the
window
his
face
still
flushed
and
working
what
the
matter
he
asked
as
she
continued
to
stare
silently
at
the
telegram
she
crumpled
the
strip
of
paper
in
her
hand
if
only
she
had
been
alone
had
had
a
chance
to
think
out
her
answers
what
on
earth
the
matter
he
repeated
oh
nothing
nothing
nothing
when
you
as
white
as
a
sheet
am
i
she
gave
a
slight
laugh
it
only
a
cable
from
home
ralph
she
hesitated
no
laura
what
the
devil
is
she
cabling
you
about
she
says
ralph
wants
me
now
at
once
at
once
van
degen
laughed
impatiently
why
do
he
tell
you
so
himself
what
business
is
it
of
laura
fairford
undine
gesture
implied
a
what
indeed
is
that
all
she
says
she
hesitated
again
yes
that
all
as
she
spoke
she
tossed
the
telegram
into
the
basket
beneath
the
as
if
i
did
have
to
go
anyhow
she
exclaimed
with
an
aching
clearness
of
vision
she
saw
what
lay
before
her
the
hurried
preparations
the
long
tedious
voyage
on
a
steamer
chosen
at
haphazard
the
arrival
in
the
deadly
july
heat
and
the
relapse
into
all
the
insufferable
daily
fag
of
nursery
and
kitchen
she
saw
it
and
her
imagination
recoiled
van
degen
eyes
still
hung
on
her
she
guessed
that
he
was
intensely
engaged
in
trying
to
follow
what
was
passing
through
her
mind
presently
he
came
up
to
her
again
no
longer
perilous
and
importunate
but
awkwardly
tender
ridiculously
moved
by
her
distress
undine
listen
wo
you
let
me
make
it
all
right
for
you
to
stay
her
heart
began
to
beat
more
quickly
and
she
let
him
come
close
meeting
his
eyes
coldly
but
without
anger
what
do
you
call
it
all
right
paying
my
bills
do
you
see
that
what
i
hate
and
will
never
let
myself
be
dragged
into
again
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
the
time
has
come
when
i
must
be
sensible
peter
that
why
we
must
say
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
going
back
to
ralph
she
paused
a
moment
then
she
murmured
between
her
lips
i
shall
never
go
back
to
him
then
you
do
mean
to
marry
chelles
i
told
you
we
must
say
i
got
to
look
out
for
my
future
he
stood
before
her
irresolute
tormented
his
lazy
mind
and
impatient
senses
labouring
with
a
problem
beyond
their
power
ai
i
here
to
look
out
for
your
future
he
said
at
last
no
one
shall
look
out
for
it
in
the
way
you
mean
i
rather
never
see
you
again
he
gave
her
a
baffled
stare
oh
damn
it
if
that
the
way
you
feel
he
turned
and
flung
away
toward
the
door
she
stood
motionless
where
he
left
her
every
nerve
strung
to
the
highest
pitch
of
watchfulness
as
she
stood
there
the
scene
about
her
stamped
itself
on
her
brain
with
the
sharpest
precision
she
was
aware
of
the
fading
of
the
summer
light
outside
of
the
movements
of
her
maid
who
was
laying
out
her
in
the
room
beyond
and
of
the
fact
that
the
on
her
shaken
by
van
degen
tread
were
dropping
their
petals
over
ralph
letter
and
down
on
the
crumpled
telegram
which
she
could
see
through
the
trellised
sides
of
the
in
another
moment
van
degen
would
be
gone
worse
yet
while
he
wavered
in
the
doorway
the
shallums
and
chelles
after
vainly
awaiting
her
might
dash
back
from
the
bois
and
break
in
on
them
these
and
other
chances
rose
before
her
urging
her
to
action
but
she
held
fast
immovable
unwavering
a
proud
yet
plaintive
image
of
renunciation
van
degen
hand
was
on
the
door
he
it
and
then
turned
back
that
all
you
got
to
say
then
that
all
he
jerked
the
door
open
and
passed
out
she
saw
him
stop
in
the
to
pick
up
his
hat
and
stick
his
heavy
figure
silhouetted
against
the
glare
of
the
a
ray
of
the
same
light
fell
on
her
where
she
stood
in
the
unlit
and
her
reflection
bloomed
out
like
a
flower
from
the
mirror
that
faced
her
she
looked
at
the
image
and
waited
van
degen
put
his
hat
on
his
head
and
slowly
opened
the
door
into
the
outer
hall
then
he
turned
abruptly
his
bulk
eclipsing
her
reflection
as
he
plunged
back
into
the
room
and
came
up
to
her
i
do
anything
you
say
undine
i
do
anything
in
god
world
to
keep
you
she
turned
her
eyes
from
the
mirror
and
let
them
rest
on
his
face
which
looked
as
small
and
withered
as
an
old
man
with
a
lower
lip
that
trembled
queerly
xxi
the
spring
in
new
york
proceeded
through
more
than
its
usual
extremes
of
temperature
to
the
threshold
of
a
sultry
june
ralph
marvell
wearily
bent
to
his
task
felt
the
fantastic
humours
of
the
weather
as
only
one
more
incoherence
in
the
general
chaos
of
his
case
it
was
strange
enough
after
four
years
of
marriage
to
find
himself
again
in
his
old
brown
room
in
washington
square
it
was
hardly
there
that
he
had
expected
pegasus
to
land
him
and
like
a
man
returning
to
the
scenes
of
his
childhood
he
found
everything
on
a
much
smaller
scale
than
he
had
imagined
had
the
dagonet
boundaries
really
narrowed
or
had
the
breach
in
the
walls
of
his
own
life
let
in
a
wider
vision
certainly
there
had
come
to
be
other
differences
between
his
present
and
his
former
self
than
that
embodied
in
the
presence
of
his
little
boy
in
the
next
room
paul
in
fact
was
now
the
chief
link
between
ralph
and
his
past
concerning
his
son
he
still
felt
and
thought
in
a
general
way
in
the
terms
of
the
dagonet
tradition
he
still
wanted
to
implant
in
paul
some
of
the
reserves
and
discriminations
which
divided
that
tradition
from
the
new
spirit
of
limitless
concession
but
for
himself
it
was
different
since
his
transaction
with
moffatt
he
had
had
the
sense
of
living
under
a
new
dispensation
he
was
not
sure
that
it
was
any
worse
than
the
other
but
then
he
was
no
longer
very
sure
about
anything
perhaps
this
growing
indifference
was
merely
the
reaction
from
a
long
nervous
strain
that
his
mother
and
sister
thought
it
so
was
shown
by
the
way
in
which
they
mutely
watched
and
hovered
their
discretion
was
like
the
hushed
tread
about
a
they
permitted
themselves
no
criticism
of
undine
he
was
asked
no
awkward
questions
subjected
to
no
sympathy
they
simply
took
him
back
on
his
own
terms
into
the
life
he
had
left
them
to
and
their
silence
had
none
of
those
subtle
implications
of
disapproval
which
may
be
so
much
more
wounding
than
speech
for
a
while
he
received
a
weekly
letter
from
undine
vague
and
disappointing
though
they
were
these
missives
helped
him
through
the
days
but
he
looked
forward
to
them
rather
as
a
pretext
for
replies
than
for
their
actual
contents
undine
was
never
at
a
loss
for
the
spoken
word
ralph
had
often
wondered
at
her
verbal
range
and
her
fluent
use
of
terms
outside
the
current
vocabulary
she
had
certainly
not
picked
these
up
in
books
since
she
never
opened
one
they
seemed
rather
like
some
odd
transmission
of
her
preaching
grandparent
oratory
but
in
her
brief
and
colourless
letters
she
repeated
the
same
bald
statements
in
the
same
few
terms
she
was
well
she
had
been
round
with
bertha
shallum
she
had
dined
with
the
jim
driscolls
or
may
beringer
or
dicky
bowles
the
weather
was
too
lovely
or
too
awful
such
was
the
gist
of
her
news
on
the
last
page
she
hoped
paul
was
well
and
sent
him
a
kiss
but
she
never
made
a
suggestion
concerning
his
care
or
asked
a
question
about
his
pursuits
one
could
only
infer
that
knowing
in
what
good
hands
he
was
she
judged
such
solicitude
superfluous
and
it
was
thus
that
ralph
put
the
matter
to
his
mother
of
course
she
not
worrying
about
the
boy
why
should
she
she
knows
that
with
you
and
laura
he
as
happy
as
a
king
to
which
marvell
would
answer
gravely
when
you
write
be
sure
to
say
i
sha
put
on
his
thinner
flannels
as
long
as
this
east
wind
lasts
as
for
her
husband
welfare
undine
sole
allusion
to
it
consisted
in
the
invariable
expression
of
the
hope
that
he
was
getting
along
all
right
the
phrase
was
always
the
same
and
ralph
learned
to
know
just
how
far
down
the
third
page
to
look
for
it
in
a
postscript
she
sometimes
asked
him
to
tell
her
mother
about
a
new
way
of
doing
hair
or
cutting
a
skirt
and
this
was
usually
the
most
eloquent
passage
of
the
letter
what
satisfaction
he
extracted
from
these
communications
he
would
have
found
it
hard
to
say
yet
when
they
did
not
come
he
missed
them
hardly
less
than
if
they
had
given
him
all
he
craved
sometimes
the
mere
act
of
holding
the
blue
or
mauve
sheet
and
breathing
its
scent
was
like
holding
his
wife
hand
and
being
enveloped
in
her
fresh
young
fragrance
the
sentimental
disappointment
vanished
in
the
penetrating
physical
sensation
in
other
moods
it
was
enough
to
trace
the
letters
of
the
first
line
and
the
last
for
the
desert
of
perfunctory
phrases
between
the
two
to
vanish
leaving
him
only
the
vision
of
their
interlaced
names
as
of
a
mystic
bond
which
her
own
hand
had
tied
or
else
he
saw
her
closely
palpably
before
him
as
she
sat
at
her
frowning
and
a
little
flushed
her
bent
nape
showing
the
light
on
her
hair
her
short
lip
pulled
up
by
the
effort
of
composition
and
this
picture
had
the
violent
reality
of
on
the
verge
of
waking
at
other
times
as
he
read
her
letter
he
felt
simply
that
at
least
in
the
moment
of
writing
it
she
had
been
with
him
but
in
one
of
the
last
she
had
said
to
excuse
a
bad
blot
and
an
incoherent
sentence
everybody
talking
to
me
at
once
and
i
do
know
what
i
writing
that
letter
he
had
thrown
into
the
fire
after
the
first
few
weeks
the
letters
came
less
and
less
regularly
at
the
end
of
two
months
they
ceased
ralph
had
got
into
the
habit
of
watching
for
them
on
the
days
when
a
foreign
post
was
due
and
as
the
weeks
went
by
without
a
sign
he
began
to
invent
excuses
for
leaving
the
office
earlier
and
hurrying
back
to
washington
square
to
search
the
for
a
big
tinted
envelope
with
a
straggling
blotted
superscription
undine
departure
had
given
him
a
momentary
sense
of
liberation
at
that
stage
in
their
relations
any
change
would
have
brought
relief
but
now
that
she
was
gone
he
knew
she
could
never
really
go
though
his
feeling
for
her
had
changed
it
still
ruled
his
life
if
he
saw
her
in
her
weakness
he
felt
her
in
her
power
the
power
of
youth
and
physical
radiance
that
clung
to
his
disenchanted
memories
as
the
scent
she
used
clung
to
her
letters
looking
back
at
their
four
years
of
marriage
he
began
to
ask
himself
if
he
had
done
all
he
could
to
draw
her
spirit
from
its
sleep
had
he
not
expected
too
much
at
first
and
grown
too
indifferent
in
the
sequel
after
all
she
was
still
in
the
toy
age
and
perhaps
the
very
extravagance
of
his
love
had
retarded
her
growth
helped
to
imprison
her
in
a
little
circle
of
frivolous
illusions
but
the
last
months
had
made
a
man
of
him
and
when
she
came
back
he
would
know
how
to
lift
her
to
the
height
of
his
experience
so
he
would
reason
day
by
day
as
he
hastened
back
to
washington
square
but
when
he
opened
the
door
and
his
first
glance
at
the
hall
table
showed
him
there
was
no
letter
there
his
illusions
shrivelled
down
to
their
weak
roots
she
had
not
written
she
did
not
mean
to
write
he
and
the
boy
were
no
longer
a
part
of
her
life
when
she
came
back
everything
would
be
as
it
had
been
before
with
the
dreary
difference
that
she
had
tasted
new
pleasures
and
that
their
absence
would
take
the
savour
from
all
he
had
to
give
her
then
the
coming
of
another
foreign
mail
would
lift
his
hopes
and
as
he
hurried
home
he
would
imagine
new
reasons
for
expecting
a
letter
week
after
week
he
swung
between
the
extremes
of
hope
and
dejection
and
at
last
when
the
strain
had
become
unbearable
he
cabled
her
the
answer
ran
very
well
best
love
writing
but
the
promised
letter
never
came
he
went
on
steadily
with
his
work
he
even
passed
through
a
phase
of
exaggerated
energy
but
his
baffled
youth
fought
in
him
for
air
was
this
to
be
the
end
was
he
to
wear
his
life
out
in
useless
drudgery
the
plain
prose
of
it
of
course
was
that
the
economic
situation
remained
unchanged
by
the
sentimental
catastrophe
and
that
he
must
go
on
working
for
his
wife
and
child
but
at
any
rate
as
it
was
mainly
for
paul
that
he
would
henceforth
work
it
should
be
on
his
own
terms
and
according
to
his
inherited
notions
of
straightness
he
would
never
again
engage
in
any
transaction
resembling
his
compact
with
moffatt
even
now
he
was
not
sure
there
had
been
anything
crooked
in
that
but
the
fact
of
his
having
instinctively
referred
the
point
to
spragg
rather
than
to
his
grandfather
implied
a
presumption
against
it
his
partners
were
quick
to
profit
by
his
sudden
spurt
of
energy
and
his
work
grew
no
lighter
he
was
not
only
the
youngest
and
most
recent
member
of
the
firm
but
the
one
who
had
so
far
added
least
to
the
volume
of
its
business
his
hours
were
the
longest
his
absences
as
summer
approached
the
least
frequent
and
the
most
grudgingly
accorded
no
doubt
his
associates
knew
that
he
was
pressed
for
money
and
could
not
risk
a
break
they
worked
him
and
he
was
aware
of
it
and
submitted
because
he
dared
not
lose
his
job
but
the
long
hours
of
mechanical
drudgery
were
telling
on
his
active
body
and
undisciplined
nerves
he
had
begun
too
late
to
subject
himself
to
the
persistent
mortification
of
spirit
and
flesh
which
is
a
condition
of
the
average
business
life
and
after
the
long
dull
days
in
the
office
the
evenings
at
his
did
not
give
him
the
he
needed
almost
every
one
had
gone
out
of
town
but
now
and
then
miss
ray
came
to
dine
and
ralph
seated
beneath
the
family
portraits
and
opposite
the
desiccated
harriet
who
had
already
faded
to
the
semblance
of
one
of
her
own
listened
languidly
to
the
kind
of
talk
that
the
originals
might
have
exchanged
about
the
same
table
when
new
york
gentility
centred
in
the
battery
and
the
bowling
green
dagonet
was
always
pleasant
to
see
and
hear
but
his
sarcasms
were
growing
faint
and
recondite
they
had
as
little
bearing
on
life
as
the
humours
of
a
restoration
comedy
as
for
marvell
and
miss
ray
they
seemed
to
the
young
man
even
more
spectrally
remote
hardly
anything
that
mattered
to
him
existed
for
them
and
their
prejudices
reminded
him
of
warning
off
trespassers
who
have
long
since
ceased
to
intrude
now
and
then
he
dined
at
his
club
and
went
on
to
the
theatre
with
some
young
men
of
his
own
age
but
he
left
them
afterward
half
vexed
with
himself
for
not
being
in
the
humour
to
prolong
the
adventure
there
were
moments
when
he
would
have
liked
to
affirm
his
freedom
in
however
commonplace
a
way
moments
when
the
vulgarest
way
would
have
seemed
the
most
satisfying
but
he
always
ended
by
walking
home
alone
and
upstairs
through
the
sleeping
house
lest
he
should
wake
his
boy
on
saturday
afternoons
when
the
business
world
was
hurrying
to
the
country
for
golf
and
tennis
he
stayed
in
town
and
took
paul
to
see
the
spraggs
several
times
since
his
wife
departure
he
had
tried
to
bring
about
closer
relations
between
his
own
family
and
undine
and
the
ladies
of
washington
square
in
their
eagerness
to
meet
his
wishes
had
made
various
friendly
advances
to
spragg
but
they
were
met
by
a
mute
resistance
which
made
ralph
suspect
that
undine
strictures
on
his
family
had
taken
root
in
her
mother
brooding
mind
and
he
gave
up
the
struggle
to
bring
together
what
had
been
so
effectually
put
asunder
if
he
regretted
his
lack
of
success
it
was
chiefly
because
he
was
so
sorry
for
the
spraggs
soon
after
undine
marriage
they
had
abandoned
their
polychrome
suite
at
the
stentorian
and
since
then
their
peregrinations
had
carried
them
through
half
the
hotels
of
the
metropolis
undine
who
had
early
discovered
her
mistake
in
thinking
hotel
life
fashionable
had
tried
to
persuade
her
parents
to
take
a
house
of
their
own
but
though
they
refrained
from
taxing
her
with
inconsistency
they
did
not
act
on
her
suggestion
spragg
seemed
to
shrink
from
the
thought
of
going
back
to
and
ralph
suspected
that
she
depended
on
the
transit
from
hotel
to
hotel
as
the
one
element
of
variety
in
her
life
as
for
spragg
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
any
one
in
whom
the
domestic
sentiments
were
more
completely
unlocalized
and
disconnected
from
any
fixed
habits
and
he
was
probably
aware
of
his
changes
of
abode
chiefly
as
they
obliged
him
to
ascend
from
the
subway
or
descend
from
the
elevated
a
few
blocks
higher
up
or
lower
down
neither
husband
nor
wife
complained
to
ralph
of
their
frequent
displacements
or
assigned
to
them
any
cause
save
the
vague
one
of
guessing
they
could
do
better
but
ralph
noticed
that
the
decreasing
luxury
of
their
life
synchronized
with
undine
growing
demands
for
money
during
the
last
few
months
they
had
transferred
themselves
to
the
malibran
a
tall
narrow
structure
resembling
a
divided
into
cells
where
linoleum
and
lincrusta
simulated
the
stucco
and
marble
of
the
stentorian
and
fagged
business
men
and
their
families
consumed
the
watery
stews
dispensed
by
coloured
help
in
the
grey
twilight
of
a
basement
spragg
had
no
and
paul
and
his
father
had
to
be
received
in
one
of
the
long
public
parlours
between
ladies
seated
at
rickety
desks
in
the
throes
of
correspondence
and
groups
of
listlessly
conversing
residents
and
callers
the
spraggs
were
intensely
proud
of
their
grandson
and
ralph
perceived
that
they
would
have
liked
to
see
paul
charging
uproariously
from
group
to
group
and
thrusting
his
bright
curls
and
cherubic
smile
upon
the
general
attention
the
fact
that
the
boy
preferred
to
stand
between
his
grandfather
knees
and
play
with
spragg
masonic
emblem
or
dangle
his
legs
from
the
arm
of
spragg
chair
seemed
to
his
grandparents
evidence
of
or
undue
repression
and
he
was
subjected
by
spragg
to
searching
enquiries
as
to
how
his
food
set
and
whether
he
did
think
his
popper
was
too
strict
with
him
a
more
embarrassing
problem
was
raised
by
the
surprise
in
the
shape
of
peanut
candy
or
chocolate
creams
which
he
was
invited
to
hunt
for
in
pockets
and
which
ralph
had
to
confiscate
on
the
way
home
lest
the
dietary
rules
of
washington
square
should
be
too
visibly
infringed
sometimes
ralph
found
heeny
ruddy
and
jovial
seated
in
the
opposite
spragg
and
regaling
her
with
selections
from
a
new
batch
of
clippings
during
undine
illness
of
the
previous
winter
heeny
had
become
a
familiar
figure
to
paul
who
had
learned
to
expect
almost
as
much
from
her
bag
as
from
his
grandmother
pockets
so
that
the
intemperate
saturdays
at
the
malibran
were
usually
followed
by
languid
and
abstemious
sundays
in
washington
square
heeny
being
unaware
of
this
sequel
to
her
bounties
formed
the
habit
of
appearing
regularly
on
saturdays
and
while
she
chatted
with
his
grandmother
the
little
boy
was
encouraged
to
scatter
the
grimy
carpet
with
and
bunches
of
clippings
in
his
thrilling
quest
for
the
sweets
at
the
bottom
of
her
bag
i
declare
if
he
ai
in
just
as
much
of
a
hurry
everything
as
his
mother
she
exclaimed
one
day
in
her
rich
rolling
voice
and
stooping
to
pick
up
a
long
strip
of
newspaper
which
paul
had
flung
aside
she
added
as
she
smoothed
it
out
i
guess
he
was
a
little
mite
older
he
be
better
pleased
with
this
with
the
candy
it
the
very
thing
i
was
trying
to
find
for
you
the
other
day
spragg
she
went
on
holding
the
bit
of
paper
at
arm
length
and
she
began
to
read
out
with
a
loudness
proportioned
to
the
distance
between
her
eyes
and
the
text
with
two
such
sprinters
as
van
degen
and
dicky
bowles
to
set
the
pace
it
no
wonder
the
new
york
set
in
paris
has
struck
a
livelier
gait
than
ever
this
spring
it
a
season
and
no
mistake
and
no
one
lags
behind
less
than
the
fascinating
ralph
marvell
who
is
to
be
seen
daily
and
nightly
in
all
the
smartest
restaurants
and
naughtiest
theatres
with
so
many
devoted
swains
in
attendance
that
the
rival
beauties
of
both
worlds
are
said
to
be
making
catty
comments
but
then
marvell
gowns
are
almost
as
good
as
her
looks
and
how
can
you
expect
the
other
women
to
stand
for
such
a
monopoly
to
escape
the
strain
of
these
visits
ralph
once
or
twice
tried
the
experiment
of
leaving
paul
with
his
and
calling
for
him
in
the
late
afternoon
but
one
day
on
the
malibran
he
was
met
by
a
small
abashed
figure
clad
in
a
kaleidoscopic
tartan
and
a
green
velvet
cap
with
a
silver
thistle
after
this
experience
of
the
surprises
of
which
was
capable
when
she
had
a
chance
to
take
paul
shopping
ralph
did
not
again
venture
to
leave
his
son
and
their
subsequent
saturdays
were
passed
together
in
the
sultry
gloom
of
the
malibran
conversation
with
the
spraggs
was
almost
impossible
ralph
could
talk
with
his
in
his
office
but
in
the
hotel
parlour
spragg
sat
in
a
ruminating
silence
broken
only
by
the
emission
of
an
occasional
well
well
addressed
to
his
grandson
as
for
spragg
her
could
not
remember
having
had
a
sustained
conversation
with
her
since
the
distant
day
when
he
had
first
called
at
the
stentorian
and
had
been
entertained
in
undine
absence
by
her
astonished
mother
the
shock
of
that
encounter
had
moved
spragg
to
eloquence
but
ralph
entrance
into
the
family
without
making
him
seem
less
of
a
stranger
appeared
once
for
all
to
have
relieved
her
of
the
obligation
of
finding
something
to
say
to
him
the
one
question
she
invariably
asked
you
heard
from
undie
had
been
relatively
easy
to
answer
while
his
wife
infrequent
letters
continued
to
arrive
but
a
saturday
came
when
he
felt
the
blood
rise
to
his
temples
as
for
the
fourth
consecutive
week
he
stammered
out
under
the
snapping
eyes
of
heeny
no
not
by
this
post
either
i
begin
to
think
i
must
have
lost
a
letter
and
it
was
then
that
spragg
who
had
sat
silently
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
cut
short
his
exclamation
by
an
enquiry
about
real
estate
in
the
bronx
after
that
ralph
noticed
spragg
never
again
renewed
her
question
and
he
understood
that
his
had
guessed
his
embarrassment
and
wished
to
spare
it
ralph
had
never
thought
of
looking
for
any
delicacy
of
feeling
under
spragg
large
lazy
irony
and
the
incident
drew
the
two
men
nearer
together
spragg
for
her
part
was
certainly
not
delicate
but
she
was
simple
and
without
malice
and
ralph
liked
her
for
her
silent
acceptance
of
her
diminished
state
sometimes
as
he
sat
between
the
lonely
primitive
old
couple
he
wondered
from
what
source
voracious
ambitions
had
been
drawn
all
she
cared
for
and
attached
importance
to
was
as
remote
from
her
parents
conception
of
life
as
her
impatient
greed
from
their
passive
stoicism
one
hot
afternoon
toward
the
end
of
june
ralph
suddenly
wondered
if
clare
van
degen
were
still
in
town
she
had
dined
in
washington
square
some
ten
days
earlier
and
he
remembered
her
saying
that
she
had
sent
the
children
down
to
long
island
but
that
she
herself
meant
to
stay
on
in
town
till
the
heat
grew
unbearable
she
hated
her
big
showy
place
on
long
island
she
was
tired
of
the
spring
trip
to
london
and
paris
where
one
met
at
every
turn
the
faces
one
had
grown
sick
of
seeing
all
winter
and
she
declared
that
in
the
early
summer
new
york
was
the
only
place
in
which
one
could
escape
from
new
yorkers
she
put
the
case
amusingly
and
it
was
like
her
to
take
up
any
attitude
that
went
against
the
habits
of
her
set
but
she
lived
at
the
mercy
of
her
moods
and
one
could
never
tell
how
long
any
one
of
them
would
rule
her
as
he
sat
in
his
office
with
the
noise
and
glare
of
the
endless
afternoon
rising
up
in
hot
waves
from
the
street
there
wandered
into
ralph
mind
a
vision
of
her
shady
all
day
it
hung
before
him
like
the
mirage
of
a
spring
before
a
dusty
traveller
he
felt
a
positive
thirst
for
her
presence
for
the
sound
of
her
voice
the
wide
spaces
and
luxurious
silences
surrounding
her
it
was
perhaps
because
on
that
particular
day
a
spiral
pain
was
twisting
around
in
the
back
of
his
head
and
digging
in
a
little
deeper
with
each
twist
and
because
the
figures
on
the
balance
sheet
before
him
were
hopping
about
like
black
imps
in
an
infernal
that
the
picture
hung
there
so
persistently
it
was
a
long
time
since
he
had
wanted
anything
as
much
as
at
that
particular
moment
he
wanted
to
be
with
clare
and
hear
her
voice
and
as
soon
as
he
had
ground
out
the
day
measure
of
work
he
rang
up
the
van
degen
palace
and
learned
that
she
was
still
in
town
the
lowered
awnings
of
her
inner
cast
a
luminous
shadow
on
old
cabinets
and
consoles
and
on
the
pale
flowers
scattered
here
and
there
in
vases
of
bronze
and
porcelain
clare
taste
was
as
capricious
as
her
moods
and
the
rest
of
the
house
was
not
in
harmony
with
this
room
there
was
in
particular
another
which
she
now
described
as
peter
creation
but
which
ralph
knew
to
be
partly
hers
a
heavily
decorated
apartment
where
popple
portrait
of
her
throned
over
a
waste
of
gilt
furniture
it
was
characteristic
that
she
had
had
ralph
shown
in
by
another
way
and
that
as
she
had
spared
him
the
polyphonic
so
she
had
skilfully
adapted
her
own
appearance
to
her
soberer
background
she
sat
near
the
window
reading
in
a
clear
cool
dress
and
at
his
entrance
she
merely
slipped
a
finger
between
the
pages
and
looked
up
at
him
her
way
of
receiving
him
made
him
feel
that
restlessness
and
stridency
were
as
unlike
her
genuine
self
as
the
gilded
and
that
this
quiet
creature
was
the
only
real
clare
the
clare
who
had
once
been
so
nearly
his
and
who
seemed
to
want
him
to
know
that
she
had
never
wholly
been
any
one
else
why
did
you
let
me
know
you
were
still
in
town
he
asked
as
he
sat
down
in
the
near
her
chair
her
dark
smile
deepened
i
hoped
you
come
and
see
one
never
knows
with
you
he
was
looking
about
the
room
with
a
kind
of
confused
pleasure
in
its
pale
shadows
and
spots
of
dark
rich
colour
the
old
lacquer
screen
behind
clare
head
looked
like
a
lustreless
black
pool
with
gold
leaves
floating
on
it
and
another
piece
a
little
table
at
her
elbow
had
the
brown
bloom
and
the
curves
of
an
old
violin
i
like
to
be
here
ralph
said
she
did
not
make
the
mistake
of
asking
then
why
do
you
never
come
instead
she
turned
away
and
drew
an
inner
curtain
across
the
window
to
shut
out
the
sunlight
which
was
beginning
to
slant
in
under
the
awning
the
mere
fact
of
her
not
answering
and
the
final
touch
of
which
her
gesture
gave
reminded
him
of
other
summer
days
they
had
spent
together
long
rambling
days
in
the
hot
woods
and
fields
when
they
had
never
thought
of
talking
to
each
other
unless
there
was
something
they
particularly
wanted
to
say
his
tired
fancy
strayed
off
for
a
second
to
the
thought
of
what
it
would
have
been
like
come
back
at
the
end
of
the
day
to
such
a
sweet
community
of
silence
but
his
mind
was
too
crowded
with
importunate
facts
for
any
lasting
view
of
visionary
distances
the
thought
faded
and
he
merely
felt
how
restful
it
was
to
have
her
near
i
glad
you
stayed
in
town
you
must
let
me
come
again
he
said
i
suppose
you
ca
always
get
away
she
answered
and
she
began
to
listen
with
grave
intelligent
eyes
to
his
description
of
his
tedious
days
with
her
eyes
on
him
he
felt
the
exquisite
relief
of
talking
about
himself
as
he
had
not
dared
to
talk
to
any
one
since
his
marriage
he
would
not
for
the
world
have
confessed
his
discouragement
his
consciousness
of
incapacity
to
undine
and
in
washington
square
any
hint
of
failure
would
have
been
taken
as
a
criticism
of
what
his
wife
demanded
of
him
only
to
clare
van
degen
could
he
cry
out
his
present
despondency
and
his
loathing
of
the
interminable
task
ahead
a
man
does
know
till
he
tries
it
how
killing
uncongenial
work
is
and
how
it
destroys
the
power
of
doing
what
one
fit
for
even
if
there
time
for
both
but
there
paul
to
be
looked
out
for
and
i
dare
chuck
my
job
i
in
mortal
terror
of
its
chucking
me
little
by
little
he
slipped
into
a
detailed
recital
of
all
his
lesser
worries
the
most
recent
of
which
was
his
experience
with
the
lipscombs
who
after
a
two
months
tenancy
of
the
west
end
avenue
house
had
decamped
without
paying
their
rent
clare
laughed
contemptuously
yes
i
heard
he
come
to
grief
and
been
suspended
from
the
stock
exchange
and
i
see
in
the
papers
that
his
wife
retort
has
been
to
sue
for
a
divorce
ralph
knew
that
like
all
their
clan
his
cousin
regarded
a
as
a
vulgar
and
unnecessary
way
of
taking
the
public
into
confidence
his
mind
flashed
back
to
the
family
feast
in
washington
square
in
celebration
of
his
engagement
he
recalled
his
chance
allusion
to
lipscomb
and
undine
answer
fluted
out
on
her
highest
note
oh
i
guess
she
get
a
divorce
pretty
soon
he
been
a
disappointment
to
her
ralph
could
still
hear
the
horrified
murmur
with
which
his
mother
had
rebuked
his
laugh
for
he
had
laughed
had
thought
undine
speech
fresh
and
natural
now
he
felt
the
ironic
rebound
of
her
words
heaven
knew
he
had
been
a
disappointment
to
her
and
what
was
there
in
her
own
feeling
or
in
her
inherited
prejudices
to
prevent
her
seeking
the
same
redress
as
mabel
lipscomb
he
wondered
if
the
same
thought
were
in
his
mind
they
began
to
talk
of
other
things
books
pictures
plays
and
one
by
one
the
closed
doors
opened
and
light
was
let
into
dusty
shuttered
places
clare
mind
was
neither
keen
nor
deep
ralph
in
the
past
had
smiled
at
her
rash
ardours
and
vague
intensities
but
she
had
his
own
range
of
allusions
and
a
great
gift
of
momentary
understanding
and
he
had
so
long
beaten
his
thoughts
out
against
a
blank
wall
of
incomprehension
that
her
sympathy
seemed
full
of
insight
she
began
by
a
question
about
his
writing
but
the
subject
was
distasteful
to
him
and
he
turned
the
talk
to
a
new
book
in
which
he
had
been
interested
she
knew
enough
of
it
to
slip
in
the
right
word
here
and
there
and
thence
they
wandered
on
to
kindred
topics
under
the
warmth
of
her
attention
his
torpid
ideas
awoke
again
and
his
eyes
took
their
fill
of
pleasure
as
she
leaned
forward
her
thin
brown
hands
clasped
on
her
knees
and
her
eager
face
reflecting
all
his
feelings
there
was
a
moment
when
the
two
currents
of
sensation
were
merged
in
one
and
he
began
to
feel
confusedly
that
he
was
young
and
she
was
kind
and
that
there
was
nothing
he
would
like
better
than
to
go
on
sitting
there
not
much
caring
what
she
said
or
how
he
answered
if
only
she
would
let
him
look
at
her
and
give
him
one
of
her
thin
brown
hands
to
hold
then
the
corkscrew
in
the
back
of
his
head
dug
into
him
again
with
a
deeper
thrust
and
she
seemed
suddenly
to
recede
to
a
great
distance
and
be
divided
from
him
by
a
fog
of
pain
the
fog
lifted
after
a
minute
but
it
left
him
queerly
remote
from
her
from
the
cool
room
with
its
scents
and
shadows
and
from
all
the
objects
which
a
moment
before
had
so
sharply
impinged
upon
his
senses
it
was
as
though
he
looked
at
it
all
through
a
pane
against
which
his
hand
would
strike
if
he
held
it
out
to
her
that
impression
passed
also
and
he
found
himself
thinking
how
tired
he
was
and
how
little
anything
mattered
he
recalled
the
unfinished
piece
of
work
on
his
desk
and
for
a
moment
had
the
odd
illusion
that
it
was
there
before
him
she
exclaimed
but
are
you
going
and
her
exclamation
made
him
aware
that
he
had
left
his
seat
and
was
standing
in
front
of
her
he
fancied
there
was
some
kind
of
appeal
in
her
brown
eyes
but
she
was
so
dim
and
far
off
that
he
could
be
sure
of
what
she
wanted
and
the
next
moment
he
found
himself
shaking
hands
with
her
and
heard
her
saying
something
kind
and
cold
about
its
having
been
so
nice
to
see
him
half
way
up
the
stairs
little
paul
shining
and
rosy
from
supper
lurked
in
ambush
for
his
evening
game
ralph
was
fond
of
stooping
down
to
let
the
boy
climb
up
his
outstretched
arms
to
his
shoulders
but
as
he
did
so
paul
hug
seemed
to
crush
him
in
a
vice
and
the
shout
of
welcome
that
accompanied
it
racked
his
ears
like
an
explosion
of
the
queer
distance
between
himself
and
the
rest
of
the
world
was
annihilated
again
everything
stared
and
glared
and
clutched
him
he
tried
to
turn
away
his
face
from
the
child
hot
kisses
and
as
he
did
so
he
caught
sight
of
a
mauve
envelope
among
the
hats
and
sticks
on
the
hall
table
instantly
he
passed
paul
over
to
his
nurse
stammered
out
a
word
about
being
tired
and
sprang
up
the
long
flights
to
his
study
the
pain
in
his
head
had
stopped
but
his
hands
trembled
as
he
tore
open
the
envelope
within
it
was
a
second
letter
bearing
a
french
stamp
and
addressed
to
himself
it
looked
like
a
business
communication
and
had
apparently
been
sent
to
undine
hotel
in
paris
and
forwarded
to
him
by
her
hand
another
bill
he
reflected
grimly
as
he
threw
it
aside
and
felt
in
the
outer
envelope
for
her
letter
there
was
nothing
there
and
after
a
first
sharp
pang
of
disappointment
he
picked
up
the
enclosure
and
opened
it
inside
was
a
lithographed
circular
headed
confidential
and
bearing
the
paris
address
of
a
firm
of
private
detectives
who
undertook
in
conditions
of
attested
and
inviolable
discretion
to
investigate
delicate
situations
look
up
doubtful
antecedents
and
furnish
reliable
evidence
of
misconduct
all
on
the
most
reasonable
terms
for
a
long
time
ralph
sat
and
stared
at
this
document
then
he
began
to
laugh
and
tossed
it
into
the
after
that
with
a
groan
he
dropped
his
head
against
the
edge
of
his
writing
table
xxii
when
he
woke
the
first
thing
he
remembered
was
the
fact
of
having
cried
he
could
not
think
how
he
had
come
to
be
such
a
fool
he
hoped
to
heaven
no
one
had
seen
him
he
supposed
he
must
have
been
worrying
about
the
unfinished
piece
of
work
at
the
office
where
was
it
by
the
way
he
wondered
why
where
he
had
left
it
the
day
before
of
course
what
a
ridiculous
thing
to
worry
about
but
it
seemed
to
follow
him
about
like
a
dog
he
said
to
himself
that
he
must
get
up
presently
and
go
down
to
the
office
presently
when
he
could
open
his
eyes
just
now
there
was
a
dead
weight
on
them
he
tried
one
after
another
in
vain
the
effort
set
him
weakly
trembling
and
he
wanted
to
cry
again
nonsense
he
must
get
out
of
bed
he
stretched
his
arms
out
trying
to
reach
something
to
pull
himself
up
by
but
everything
slipped
away
and
evaded
him
it
was
like
trying
to
catch
at
bright
short
waves
then
suddenly
his
fingers
clasped
themselves
about
something
firm
and
warm
a
hand
a
hand
that
gave
back
his
pressure
the
relief
was
inexpressible
he
lay
still
and
let
the
hand
hold
him
while
mentally
he
went
through
the
motions
of
getting
up
and
beginning
to
dress
so
indistinct
were
the
boundaries
between
thought
and
action
that
he
really
felt
himself
moving
about
the
room
in
a
queer
disembodied
way
as
one
treads
the
air
in
sleep
then
he
felt
the
bedclothes
over
him
and
the
pillows
under
his
head
i
must
get
up
he
said
and
pulled
at
the
hand
it
pressed
him
down
again
down
into
a
dim
deep
pool
of
sleep
he
lay
there
for
a
long
time
in
a
silent
blackness
far
below
light
and
sound
then
he
gradually
floated
to
the
surface
with
the
buoyancy
of
a
dead
body
but
his
body
had
never
been
more
alive
jagged
strokes
of
pain
tore
through
it
hands
dragged
at
it
with
nails
that
bit
like
teeth
they
wound
thongs
about
him
bound
him
tied
weights
to
him
tried
to
pull
him
down
with
them
but
still
he
floated
floated
danced
on
the
fiery
waves
of
pain
with
barbed
light
pouring
down
on
him
from
an
arrowy
sky
charmed
intervals
of
rest
blue
sailings
on
melodious
seas
alternated
with
the
anguish
he
became
a
leaf
on
the
air
a
feather
on
a
current
a
straw
on
the
tide
the
spray
of
the
wave
spinning
itself
to
sunshine
as
the
wave
toppled
over
into
gulfs
of
blue
he
woke
on
a
stony
beach
his
legs
and
arms
still
lashed
to
his
sides
and
the
thongs
cutting
into
him
but
the
fierce
sky
was
hidden
and
hidden
by
his
own
languid
lids
he
felt
the
ecstasy
of
decreasing
pain
and
courage
came
to
him
to
open
his
eyes
and
look
about
him
the
beach
was
his
own
bed
the
tempered
light
lay
on
familiar
things
and
some
one
was
moving
about
in
a
shadowy
way
between
bed
and
window
he
was
thirsty
and
some
one
gave
him
a
drink
his
pillow
burned
and
some
one
turned
the
cool
side
out
his
brain
was
clear
enough
now
for
him
to
understand
that
he
was
ill
and
to
want
to
talk
about
it
but
his
tongue
hung
in
his
throat
like
a
clapper
in
a
bell
he
must
wait
till
the
rope
was
pulled
so
time
and
life
stole
back
on
him
and
his
thoughts
laboured
weakly
with
dim
fears
slowly
he
cleared
a
way
through
them
adjusted
himself
to
his
strange
state
and
found
out
that
he
was
in
his
own
room
in
his
grandfather
house
that
alternating
with
the
faces
about
him
were
those
of
his
mother
and
sister
and
that
in
a
few
days
if
he
took
his
and
did
fret
paul
would
be
brought
up
from
long
island
whither
on
account
of
the
great
heat
he
had
been
carried
off
by
clare
van
degen
no
one
named
undine
to
him
and
he
did
not
speak
of
her
but
one
day
as
he
lay
in
bed
in
the
summer
twilight
he
had
a
vision
of
a
moment
a
long
way
behind
him
at
the
beginning
of
his
illness
it
must
have
been
when
he
had
called
out
for
her
in
his
anguish
and
some
one
had
said
she
coming
she
be
here
next
week
could
it
be
that
next
week
was
not
yet
here
he
supposed
that
illness
robbed
one
of
all
sense
of
time
and
he
lay
still
as
if
in
ambush
watching
his
scattered
memories
come
out
one
by
one
and
join
themselves
together
if
he
watched
long
enough
he
was
sure
he
should
recognize
one
that
fitted
into
his
picture
of
the
day
when
he
had
asked
for
undine
and
at
length
a
face
came
out
of
the
twilight
a
freckled
face
benevolently
bent
over
him
under
a
starched
cap
he
had
not
seen
the
face
for
a
long
time
but
suddenly
it
took
shape
and
fitted
itself
into
the
picture
laura
fairford
sat
near
by
a
book
on
her
knee
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
she
looked
up
what
was
the
name
of
the
first
nurse
the
first
the
one
that
went
away
oh
miss
hicks
you
mean
how
long
is
it
since
she
went
it
must
be
three
weeks
she
had
another
case
he
thought
this
over
carefully
then
he
spoke
again
call
undine
she
made
no
answer
and
he
repeated
irritably
why
do
you
call
her
i
want
to
speak
to
her
fairford
laid
down
her
book
and
came
to
him
she
not
here
just
now
he
dealt
with
this
also
laboriously
you
mean
she
out
she
not
in
the
house
i
mean
she
has
come
yet
as
she
spoke
ralph
felt
a
sudden
strength
and
hardness
in
his
brain
and
body
everything
in
him
became
as
clear
as
noon
but
it
was
before
miss
hicks
left
that
you
told
me
you
sent
for
her
and
that
she
be
here
the
following
week
and
you
say
miss
hicks
has
been
gone
three
weeks
this
was
what
he
had
worked
out
in
his
head
and
what
he
meant
to
say
to
his
sister
but
something
seemed
to
snap
shut
in
his
throat
and
he
closed
his
eyes
without
speaking
even
when
spragg
came
to
see
him
he
said
nothing
they
talked
about
his
illness
about
the
hot
weather
about
the
rumours
that
harmon
driscoll
was
again
threatened
with
indictment
and
then
spragg
pulled
himself
out
of
his
chair
and
said
i
presume
you
call
round
at
the
office
before
you
leave
the
city
oh
yes
as
soon
as
i
up
ralph
answered
they
understood
each
other
clare
had
urged
him
to
come
down
to
long
island
and
complete
his
convalescence
there
but
he
preferred
to
stay
in
washington
square
till
he
should
be
strong
enough
for
the
journey
to
the
adirondacks
whither
laura
had
already
preceded
him
with
paul
he
did
not
want
to
see
any
one
but
his
mother
and
grandfather
till
his
legs
could
carry
him
to
spragg
office
it
was
an
oppressive
day
in
with
a
yellow
mist
of
heat
in
the
sky
when
at
last
he
entered
the
big
swirls
of
dust
lay
on
the
mosaic
floor
and
a
stale
smell
of
decayed
fruit
and
salt
air
and
steaming
asphalt
filled
the
place
like
a
fog
as
he
shot
up
in
the
elevator
some
one
slapped
him
on
the
back
and
turning
he
saw
elmer
moffatt
at
his
side
smooth
and
rubicund
under
a
new
straw
hat
moffatt
was
loudly
glad
to
see
him
i
have
laid
eyes
on
you
for
months
at
the
old
stand
still
so
am
i
he
added
as
ralph
assented
hope
to
see
you
there
again
some
day
do
forget
it
my
turn
this
time
glad
if
i
can
be
any
use
to
you
so
long
ralph
weak
bones
ached
under
his
handshake
how
mrs
marvell
he
turned
back
from
his
landing
to
call
out
and
ralph
answered
thanks
she
very
well
spragg
sat
alone
in
his
murky
inner
office
the
engraving
of
daniel
webster
above
his
head
and
the
congested
beneath
his
feet
he
looked
fagged
and
sallow
like
the
day
ralph
sat
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
desk
for
a
moment
his
throat
contracted
as
it
had
when
he
had
tried
to
question
his
sister
then
he
asked
where
undine
spragg
glanced
at
the
calendar
that
hung
from
a
on
the
door
then
he
released
the
masonic
emblem
from
his
grasp
drew
out
his
watch
and
consulted
it
critically
if
the
train
on
time
i
presume
she
somewhere
between
chicago
and
omaha
round
about
now
ralph
stared
at
him
wondering
if
the
heat
had
gone
to
his
head
i
do
understand
the
twentieth
century
generally
considered
the
best
route
to
dakota
explained
spragg
who
pronounced
the
word
rowt
do
you
mean
to
say
undine
in
the
united
states
spragg
lower
lip
groped
for
the
phantom
why
let
me
see
has
dakota
been
a
state
a
year
or
two
now
oh
god
ralph
cried
pushing
his
chair
back
violently
and
striding
across
the
narrow
room
as
he
turned
spragg
stood
up
and
advanced
a
few
steps
he
had
given
up
the
quest
for
the
and
his
lips
were
no
more
than
a
narrow
depression
in
his
beard
he
stood
before
ralph
absently
shaking
the
loose
change
in
his
ralph
felt
the
same
hardness
and
lucidity
that
had
come
to
him
when
he
had
heard
his
sister
answer
she
gone
you
mean
left
me
with
another
man
spragg
drew
himself
up
with
a
kind
of
slouching
majesty
my
daughter
is
not
that
style
i
understand
undine
thinks
there
have
been
mistakes
on
both
sides
she
considers
the
tie
was
formed
too
hastily
i
believe
desertion
is
the
usual
plea
in
such
cases
ralph
stared
about
him
hardly
listening
he
did
not
resent
his
tone
in
a
dim
way
he
guessed
that
spragg
was
suffering
hardly
less
than
himself
but
nothing
was
clear
to
him
save
the
monstrous
fact
suddenly
upheaved
in
his
path
his
wife
had
left
him
and
the
plan
for
her
evasion
had
been
made
and
executed
while
he
lay
helpless
she
had
seized
the
opportunity
of
his
illness
to
keep
him
in
ignorance
of
her
design
the
humour
of
it
suddenly
struck
him
and
he
laughed
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
undine
divorcing
me
i
presume
that
her
plan
spragg
admitted
for
desertion
ralph
pursued
still
laughing
his
hesitated
a
moment
then
he
answered
you
always
done
all
you
could
for
my
daughter
there
was
any
other
plea
she
could
think
of
she
presumed
this
would
be
the
most
agreeable
to
your
family
it
was
good
of
her
to
think
of
that
spragg
only
comment
was
a
sigh
does
she
imagine
i
wo
fight
it
ralph
broke
out
with
sudden
passion
his
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
i
presume
you
realize
it
ai
easy
to
change
undine
once
she
set
on
a
thing
perhaps
not
but
if
she
really
means
to
apply
for
a
divorce
i
can
make
it
a
little
less
easy
for
her
to
get
that
so
spragg
conceded
he
turned
back
to
his
revolving
chair
and
seating
himself
in
it
began
to
drum
on
the
desk
with
fingers
and
by
god
i
will
ralph
thundered
anger
was
the
only
emotion
in
him
now
he
had
been
fooled
cheated
made
a
mock
of
but
the
score
was
not
settled
yet
he
turned
back
and
stood
before
spragg
i
suppose
she
gone
with
van
degen
my
daughter
gone
alone
sir
i
saw
her
off
at
the
station
i
understood
she
was
to
join
a
lady
friend
at
every
point
ralph
felt
his
hold
slip
off
the
surface
of
his
impervious
fatalism
does
she
suppose
van
degen
going
to
marry
her
undine
did
mention
her
future
plans
to
me
after
a
moment
spragg
appended
if
she
had
i
should
have
declined
to
discuss
them
with
her
ralph
looked
at
him
curiously
perceiving
that
he
intended
in
this
negative
way
to
imply
his
disapproval
of
his
daughter
course
i
shall
fight
it
i
shall
fight
it
the
young
man
cried
again
you
may
tell
her
i
shall
fight
it
to
the
end
spragg
pressed
the
nib
of
his
pen
against
the
inkstand
i
suppose
you
would
have
to
engage
a
lawyer
she
know
it
that
way
he
remarked
she
know
it
you
may
count
on
that
ralph
had
begun
to
laugh
again
suddenly
he
heard
his
own
laugh
and
it
pulled
him
up
what
was
he
laughing
about
what
was
he
talking
about
the
thing
was
to
act
to
hold
his
tongue
and
act
there
was
no
use
uttering
windy
threats
to
this
old
man
a
fury
of
action
burned
in
ralph
pouring
light
into
his
mind
and
strength
into
his
muscles
he
caught
up
his
hat
and
turned
to
the
door
as
he
opened
it
spragg
rose
again
and
came
forward
with
his
slow
shambling
step
he
laid
his
hand
on
ralph
arm
i
given
anything
anything
short
of
my
girl
herself
not
to
have
this
happen
to
you
ralph
marvell
thank
you
sir
said
ralph
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
then
spragg
added
but
it
has
happened
you
know
bear
that
in
mind
nothing
you
can
do
will
change
it
time
and
again
i
found
that
a
good
thing
to
remember
xxiii
in
the
adirondacks
ralph
marvell
sat
day
after
day
on
the
balcony
of
his
little
house
above
the
lake
staring
at
the
great
white
in
the
water
and
at
the
dark
line
of
trees
that
closed
them
in
now
and
then
he
got
into
the
canoe
and
paddled
himself
through
a
winding
chain
of
ponds
to
some
lonely
clearing
in
the
forest
and
there
he
lay
on
his
back
in
the
and
watched
the
great
clouds
form
and
dissolve
themselves
above
his
head
all
his
past
life
seemed
to
be
symbolized
by
the
and
of
those
fluctuating
shapes
which
incalculable
perpetually
shifted
and
remodelled
or
swept
from
the
zenith
like
a
pinch
of
dust
his
sister
told
him
that
he
looked
well
better
than
he
had
in
years
and
there
were
moments
when
his
listlessness
his
stony
insensibility
to
the
small
pricks
and
frictions
of
daily
life
might
have
passed
for
the
serenity
of
recovered
health
there
was
no
one
with
whom
he
could
speak
of
undine
his
family
had
thrown
over
the
whole
subject
a
pall
of
silence
which
even
laura
fairford
shrank
from
raising
as
for
his
mother
ralph
had
seen
at
once
that
the
idea
of
talking
over
the
situation
was
positively
frightening
to
her
there
was
no
provision
for
such
emergencies
in
the
moral
order
of
washington
square
the
affair
was
a
scandal
and
it
was
not
in
the
dagonet
tradition
to
acknowledge
the
existence
of
scandals
ralph
recalled
a
dim
memory
of
his
childhood
the
tale
of
a
misguided
friend
of
his
mother
who
had
left
her
husband
for
a
more
congenial
companion
and
who
years
later
returning
ill
and
friendless
to
new
york
had
appealed
for
sympathy
to
marvell
the
latter
had
not
refused
to
give
it
but
she
had
put
on
her
black
cashmere
and
two
veils
when
she
went
to
see
her
unhappy
friend
and
had
never
mentioned
these
errands
of
mercy
to
her
husband
ralph
suspected
that
the
constraint
shown
by
his
mother
and
sister
was
partly
due
to
their
having
but
a
dim
and
confused
view
of
what
had
happened
in
their
vocabulary
the
word
divorce
was
wrapped
in
such
a
dark
veil
of
innuendo
as
no
ladylike
hand
would
care
to
lift
they
had
not
reached
the
point
of
differentiating
divorces
but
classed
them
indistinctively
as
disgraceful
incidents
in
which
the
woman
was
always
to
blame
but
the
man
though
her
innocent
victim
was
yet
inevitably
contaminated
the
time
involved
in
the
proceedings
was
viewed
as
a
penitential
season
during
which
it
behoved
the
family
of
the
persons
concerned
to
behave
as
if
they
were
dead
yet
any
open
allusion
to
the
reason
for
adopting
such
an
attitude
would
have
been
regarded
as
the
height
of
indelicacy
dagonet
notion
of
the
case
was
almost
as
remote
from
reality
all
he
asked
was
that
his
grandson
should
thrash
somebody
and
he
could
not
be
made
to
understand
that
the
modern
drama
of
divorce
is
sometimes
cast
without
a
lovelace
you
might
as
well
tell
me
there
was
nobody
but
adam
in
the
garden
when
eve
picked
the
apple
you
say
your
wife
was
discontented
no
woman
ever
knows
she
discontented
till
some
man
tells
her
so
my
god
i
seen
before
now
but
i
never
yet
saw
a
marriage
dissolved
like
a
business
partnership
divorce
without
a
lover
why
it
it
as
unnatural
as
getting
drunk
on
lemonade
after
this
first
explosion
dagonet
also
became
silent
and
ralph
perceived
that
what
annoyed
him
most
was
the
fact
of
the
scandal
not
being
one
in
any
gentlemanly
sense
of
the
word
it
was
like
some
nasty
business
mess
about
which
dagonet
could
pretend
to
have
an
opinion
since
such
things
did
happen
to
men
of
his
kind
that
such
a
thing
should
have
happened
to
his
only
grandson
was
probably
the
bitterest
experience
of
his
pleasantly
uneventful
life
and
it
added
a
touch
of
irony
to
ralph
unhappiness
to
know
how
little
in
the
whole
affair
he
was
cutting
the
figure
dagonet
expected
him
to
cut
at
first
he
had
chafed
under
the
taciturnity
surrounding
him
had
passionately
longed
to
cry
out
his
humiliation
his
rebellion
his
despair
then
he
began
to
feel
the
tonic
effect
of
silence
and
the
next
stage
was
reached
when
it
became
clear
to
him
that
there
was
nothing
to
say
there
were
thoughts
and
thoughts
they
bubbled
up
perpetually
from
the
black
springs
of
his
hidden
misery
they
stole
on
him
in
the
darkness
of
night
they
blotted
out
the
light
of
day
but
when
it
came
to
putting
them
into
words
and
applying
them
to
the
external
facts
of
the
case
they
seemed
totally
unrelated
to
it
one
more
white
and
glory
had
gone
from
his
sky
but
there
seemed
no
way
of
connecting
that
with
such
practical
issues
as
his
being
called
on
to
decide
whether
paul
was
to
be
put
in
knickerbockers
or
trousers
and
whether
he
should
go
back
to
washington
square
for
the
winter
or
hire
a
small
house
for
himself
and
his
son
the
latter
question
was
ultimately
decided
by
his
remaining
under
his
grandfather
roof
november
found
him
back
in
the
office
again
in
fairly
good
health
with
an
outer
skin
of
indifference
slowly
forming
over
his
lacerated
soul
there
had
been
a
hard
minute
to
live
through
when
he
came
back
to
his
old
brown
room
in
washington
square
the
walls
and
tables
were
covered
with
photographs
of
undine
effigies
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
expressing
every
possible
sentiment
dear
to
the
photographic
tradition
ralph
had
gathered
them
all
up
when
he
had
moved
from
west
end
avenue
after
undine
departure
for
europe
and
they
throned
over
his
other
possessions
as
her
image
had
throned
over
his
future
the
night
he
had
sat
in
that
very
room
and
dreamed
of
soaring
up
with
her
into
the
blue
it
was
impossible
to
go
on
living
with
her
photographs
about
him
and
one
evening
going
up
to
his
room
after
dinner
he
began
to
unhang
them
from
the
walls
and
to
gather
them
up
from
and
and
tables
then
he
looked
about
for
some
place
in
which
to
hide
them
there
were
drawers
under
his
but
they
were
full
of
old
discarded
things
and
even
if
he
emptied
the
drawers
the
photographs
in
their
heavy
frames
were
almost
all
too
large
to
fit
into
them
he
turned
next
to
the
top
shelf
of
his
cupboard
but
here
the
nurse
had
stored
paul
old
toys
his
shovels
and
every
corner
was
packed
with
the
vain
impedimenta
of
living
and
the
mere
thought
of
clearing
a
space
in
the
chaos
was
too
great
an
effort
he
began
to
replace
the
pictures
one
by
one
and
the
last
was
still
in
his
hand
when
he
heard
his
sister
voice
outside
he
hurriedly
put
the
portrait
back
in
its
usual
place
on
his
and
fairford
who
had
been
dining
in
washington
square
and
had
come
up
to
bid
him
good
night
flung
her
arms
about
him
in
a
quick
embrace
and
went
down
to
her
carriage
the
next
afternoon
when
he
came
home
from
the
office
he
did
not
at
first
see
any
change
in
his
room
but
when
he
had
lit
his
pipe
and
thrown
himself
into
his
he
noticed
that
the
photograph
of
his
wife
picture
by
popple
no
longer
faced
him
from
the
he
turned
to
his
but
her
image
had
vanished
from
there
too
then
his
eye
making
the
circuit
of
the
walls
perceived
that
they
also
had
been
stripped
not
a
single
photograph
of
undine
was
left
yet
so
adroitly
had
the
work
of
elimination
been
done
so
ingeniously
the
remaining
objects
readjusted
that
the
change
attracted
no
attention
ralph
was
angry
sore
ashamed
he
felt
as
if
laura
whose
hand
he
instantly
detected
had
taken
a
cruel
pleasure
in
her
work
and
for
an
instant
he
hated
her
for
it
then
a
sense
of
relief
stole
over
him
he
was
glad
he
could
look
about
him
without
meeting
undine
eyes
and
he
understood
that
what
had
been
done
to
his
room
he
must
do
to
his
memory
and
his
imagination
he
must
so
readjust
his
mind
that
whichever
way
he
turned
his
thoughts
her
face
should
no
longer
confront
him
but
that
was
a
task
that
laura
could
not
perform
for
him
a
task
to
be
accomplished
only
by
the
hard
continuous
tension
of
his
will
with
the
setting
in
of
the
mood
of
silence
all
desire
to
fight
his
wife
suit
died
out
the
idea
of
touching
publicly
on
anything
that
had
passed
between
himself
and
undine
had
become
unthinkable
insensibly
he
had
been
subdued
to
the
point
of
view
about
him
and
the
idea
of
calling
on
the
law
to
repair
his
shattered
happiness
struck
him
as
even
more
grotesque
than
it
was
degrading
nevertheless
some
contradictory
impulse
of
his
divided
spirit
made
him
resent
on
the
part
of
his
mother
and
sister
a
acceptance
of
his
attitude
there
were
moments
when
their
tacit
assumption
that
his
wife
was
banished
and
forgotten
irritated
him
like
the
hushed
tread
of
sympathizers
about
the
bed
of
an
invalid
who
will
not
admit
that
he
suffers
his
irritation
was
aggravated
by
the
discovery
that
marvell
and
laura
had
already
begun
to
treat
paul
as
if
he
were
an
orphan
one
day
coming
unnoticed
into
the
nursery
ralph
heard
the
boy
ask
when
his
mother
was
coming
back
and
fairford
who
was
with
him
answered
she
not
coming
back
dearest
and
you
not
to
speak
of
her
to
father
ralph
when
the
boy
was
out
of
hearing
rebuked
his
sister
for
her
answer
i
do
want
you
to
talk
of
his
mother
as
if
she
were
dead
i
do
want
you
to
forbid
paul
to
speak
of
her
laura
though
usually
so
yielding
defended
herself
what
the
use
of
encouraging
him
to
speak
of
her
when
he
never
to
see
her
the
sooner
he
forgets
her
the
better
ralph
pondered
later
if
she
asks
to
see
him
i
sha
refuse
fairford
pressed
her
lips
together
to
check
the
answer
she
never
will
ralph
heard
it
nevertheless
and
let
it
pass
nothing
gave
him
so
profound
a
sense
of
estrangement
from
his
former
life
as
the
conviction
that
his
sister
was
probably
right
he
did
not
really
believe
that
undine
would
ever
ask
to
see
her
boy
but
if
she
did
he
was
determined
not
to
refuse
her
request
time
wore
on
the
christmas
holidays
came
and
went
and
the
winter
continued
to
grind
out
the
weary
measure
of
its
days
toward
the
end
of
january
ralph
received
a
registered
letter
addressed
to
him
at
his
office
and
bearing
in
the
corner
of
the
envelope
the
names
of
a
firm
of
sioux
falls
attorneys
he
instantly
divined
that
it
contained
the
legal
notification
of
his
wife
application
for
divorce
and
as
he
wrote
his
name
in
the
postman
book
he
smiled
grimly
at
the
thought
that
the
stroke
of
his
pen
was
doubtless
signing
her
release
he
opened
the
letter
found
it
to
be
what
he
had
expected
and
locked
it
away
in
his
desk
without
mentioning
the
matter
to
any
one
he
supposed
that
with
the
putting
away
of
this
document
he
was
thrusting
the
whole
subject
out
of
sight
but
not
more
than
a
fortnight
later
as
he
sat
in
the
subway
on
his
way
his
eye
was
caught
by
his
own
name
on
the
first
page
of
the
heavily
paper
which
the
unshaved
occupant
of
the
next
seat
held
between
grimy
fists
the
blood
rushed
to
ralph
forehead
as
he
looked
over
the
man
arm
and
read
society
leader
gets
decree
and
beneath
it
the
subordinate
clause
says
husband
too
absorbed
in
business
to
make
home
happy
for
weeks
afterward
wherever
he
went
he
felt
that
blush
upon
his
forehead
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
the
coarse
fingering
of
public
curiosity
had
touched
the
secret
places
of
his
soul
and
nothing
that
had
gone
before
seemed
as
humiliating
as
this
trivial
comment
on
his
tragedy
the
paragraph
continued
on
its
way
through
the
press
and
whenever
he
took
up
a
newspaper
he
seemed
to
come
upon
it
slightly
modified
variously
developed
but
always
reverting
with
a
kind
of
unctuous
irony
to
his
financial
preoccupations
and
his
wife
consequent
loneliness
the
phrase
was
even
taken
up
by
the
paragraph
writer
called
forth
excited
letters
from
similarly
situated
victims
was
commented
on
in
humorous
editorials
and
served
as
a
text
for
pulpit
denunciations
of
the
growing
craze
for
wealth
and
finally
at
his
dentist
ralph
came
across
it
in
a
family
weekly
as
one
of
the
heart
problems
propounded
to
subscribers
with
a
gramophone
a
corset
and
a
among
the
prizes
offered
for
its
solution
xxiv
if
you
only
had
the
sense
to
come
straight
to
me
undine
spragg
there
is
a
tip
i
could
have
given
you
not
one
this
speech
in
which
a
faintly
contemptuous
compassion
for
her
case
was
blent
with
the
frankest
pride
in
her
own
probably
represented
the
nearest
approach
to
tact
that
james
rolliver
had
yet
acquired
undine
was
impartial
enough
to
note
in
it
a
distinct
advance
on
the
youthful
methods
of
indiana
frusk
yet
it
required
a
good
deal
of
to
take
the
words
to
herself
with
a
smile
while
they
seemed
to
be
laying
a
visible
scarlet
welt
across
the
pale
face
she
kept
valiantly
turned
to
her
friend
the
fact
that
she
must
permit
herself
to
be
pitied
by
indiana
frusk
gave
her
the
uttermost
measure
of
the
depth
to
which
her
fortunes
had
fallen
this
abasement
was
inflicted
on
her
in
the
staring
gold
apartment
of
the
hotel
nouveau
luxe
in
which
the
rollivers
had
established
themselves
on
their
recent
arrival
in
paris
the
vast
adorned
only
by
two
gilt
baskets
of
orchids
drooping
on
their
wires
reminded
undine
of
the
looey
suite
in
which
the
opening
scenes
of
her
own
history
had
been
enacted
and
the
resemblance
and
the
difference
were
emphasized
by
the
fact
that
the
image
of
her
past
self
was
not
inaccurately
repeated
in
the
triumphant
presence
of
indiana
rolliver
there
is
a
tip
i
could
have
given
you
not
one
rolliver
reproachfully
repeated
and
all
undine
superiorities
and
discriminations
seemed
to
shrivel
up
in
the
crude
blaze
of
the
solid
achievement
there
was
little
comfort
in
noting
for
one
private
delectation
that
indiana
spoke
of
her
husband
as
rolliver
that
she
twanged
a
piercing
r
that
one
of
her
shoulders
was
still
higher
than
the
other
and
that
her
striking
dress
was
totally
unsuited
to
the
hour
the
place
and
the
occasion
she
still
did
and
was
all
that
undine
had
so
sedulously
learned
not
to
be
and
to
do
but
to
dwell
on
these
obstacles
to
her
success
was
but
to
be
more
deeply
impressed
by
the
fact
that
she
had
nevertheless
succeeded
not
much
more
than
a
year
had
elapsed
since
undine
marvell
sitting
in
the
of
another
parisian
hotel
had
heard
the
immense
orchestral
murmur
of
paris
rise
through
the
open
windows
like
the
ascending
movement
of
her
own
hopes
the
immense
murmur
still
sounded
on
deafening
and
implacable
as
some
elemental
force
and
the
discord
in
her
fate
no
more
disturbed
it
than
the
motor
wheels
rolling
by
under
the
windows
were
disturbed
by
the
particles
of
dust
that
they
ground
to
finer
powder
as
they
passed
i
could
have
told
you
one
thing
right
off
rolliver
went
on
with
her
ringing
energy
and
that
is
to
get
your
divorce
first
thing
a
divorce
is
always
a
good
thing
to
have
you
never
can
tell
when
you
may
want
it
you
ought
to
have
attended
to
that
before
you
even
began
with
peter
van
degen
undine
listened
irresistibly
impressed
did
you
she
asked
but
rolliver
at
this
grew
suddenly
veiled
and
sibylline
she
wound
her
big
bejewelled
hand
through
her
pearls
there
were
ropes
and
ropes
of
them
and
leaned
back
modestly
sinking
her
lids
i
here
anyhow
she
rejoined
with
circumspice
in
look
and
tone
undine
obedient
to
the
challenge
continued
to
gaze
at
the
pearls
they
were
real
there
was
no
doubt
about
that
and
so
was
marriage
if
she
kept
out
of
certain
states
do
you
see
rolliver
continued
that
having
to
leave
him
when
you
did
and
rush
off
to
dakota
for
six
months
was
was
giving
him
too
much
time
to
think
and
giving
it
at
the
wrong
time
too
oh
i
see
but
what
could
i
do
i
not
an
immoral
woman
of
course
not
dearest
you
were
merely
thoughtless
that
what
i
meant
by
saying
you
ought
to
have
had
your
divorce
ready
a
flicker
of
caused
undine
to
protest
it
would
have
made
any
difference
his
wife
would
never
have
given
him
up
she
so
crazy
about
him
no
she
hates
him
so
and
she
hates
me
too
because
she
in
love
with
my
husband
indiana
bounced
out
of
her
lounging
attitude
and
struck
her
hands
together
with
a
rattle
of
rings
in
love
with
your
husband
what
the
matter
then
why
on
earth
the
four
of
you
fix
it
up
together
you
do
understand
it
was
an
undoubted
relief
to
be
able
at
last
to
say
that
to
indiana
clare
van
degen
thinks
divorce
wrong
or
rather
awfully
vulgar
vulgar
indiana
flamed
if
that
is
just
too
much
a
woman
who
in
love
with
another
woman
husband
what
does
she
think
refined
i
like
to
know
having
a
lover
i
suppose
like
the
women
in
these
nasty
french
plays
i
told
rolliver
i
wo
go
to
the
theatre
with
him
again
in
paris
it
too
utterly
low
and
the
swell
society
just
as
bad
it
simply
rotten
thank
goodness
i
was
brought
up
in
a
place
where
there
some
sense
of
decency
left
she
looked
compassionately
at
undine
it
was
new
york
that
demoralized
you
and
i
do
blame
you
for
it
out
at
apex
you
have
acted
different
you
never
never
would
have
given
way
to
your
feelings
before
you
got
your
divorce
a
slow
blush
rose
to
undine
forehead
he
seemed
so
unhappy
she
murmured
oh
i
know
said
indiana
in
a
tone
of
cold
competence
she
gave
undine
an
impatient
glance
what
was
the
understanding
between
you
when
you
left
europe
last
august
to
go
out
to
dakota
peter
was
to
go
to
reno
in
the
autumn
so
that
it
would
look
too
much
as
if
we
were
acting
together
i
was
to
come
to
chicago
to
see
him
on
his
way
out
there
and
he
never
came
no
and
he
stopped
writing
oh
he
never
writes
indiana
heaved
a
deep
sigh
of
intelligence
there
one
perfectly
clear
rule
never
let
out
of
your
sight
a
man
who
does
write
i
know
that
why
i
stayed
with
him
those
few
weeks
last
summer
indiana
sat
thinking
her
fine
shallow
eyes
fixed
unblinkingly
on
her
friend
embarrassed
face
i
suppose
there
is
anybody
else
anybody
well
now
you
got
your
divorce
anybody
else
it
would
come
in
handy
for
this
was
harder
to
bear
than
anything
that
had
gone
before
undine
could
not
have
borne
it
if
she
had
not
had
a
purpose
van
degen
owes
it
to
me
she
began
with
an
air
of
wounded
dignity
yes
yes
i
know
but
that
just
talk
if
there
is
anybody
else
i
ca
imagine
what
you
think
of
me
indiana
indiana
without
appearing
to
resent
this
challenge
again
lost
herself
in
meditation
well
i
tell
him
he
just
got
to
see
you
she
finally
emerged
from
it
to
say
undine
gave
a
quick
upward
look
this
was
what
she
had
been
waiting
for
ever
since
she
had
read
a
few
days
earlier
in
the
columns
of
her
morning
journal
that
peter
van
degen
and
and
james
rolliver
had
been
on
board
the
semantic
but
she
did
not
betray
her
expectations
by
as
much
as
the
tremor
of
an
she
knew
her
friend
well
enough
to
pour
out
to
her
the
expected
tribute
of
surprise
why
do
you
mean
to
say
you
know
him
indiana
mercy
yes
he
round
here
all
the
time
he
crossed
on
the
steamer
with
us
and
rolliver
taken
a
fancy
to
him
indiana
explained
in
the
tone
of
the
absorbed
bride
to
whom
her
husband
preferences
are
the
sole
criterion
undine
turned
a
gaze
on
her
oh
indiana
if
i
could
only
see
him
again
i
know
it
would
be
all
right
he
awfully
awfully
fond
of
me
but
his
family
have
influenced
him
against
me
i
know
what
that
is
rolliver
interjected
but
perhaps
undine
continued
it
would
be
better
if
i
could
meet
him
first
without
his
knowing
beforehand
without
your
telling
him
i
love
him
too
much
to
reproach
him
she
added
nobly
indiana
pondered
it
was
clear
that
though
the
nobility
of
the
sentiment
impressed
her
she
was
disinclined
to
renounce
the
idea
of
taking
a
more
active
part
in
her
friend
rehabilitation
but
undine
went
on
of
course
you
found
out
by
this
time
that
he
just
a
big
spoiled
baby
afterward
when
i
seen
him
if
you
talk
to
him
or
it
you
only
just
let
him
be
with
you
and
see
how
perfectly
happy
you
and
rolliver
are
indiana
seized
on
this
at
once
you
mean
that
what
he
wants
is
the
influence
of
a
home
like
ours
yes
yes
i
understand
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
just
ask
him
round
to
dine
and
let
you
know
the
day
without
telling
him
beforehand
that
you
coming
oh
indiana
undine
held
her
in
a
close
embrace
and
then
drew
away
to
say
i
so
glad
i
found
you
you
must
go
round
with
me
everywhere
there
are
lots
of
people
here
i
want
you
to
know
rolliver
expression
changed
from
vague
sympathy
to
concentrated
interest
i
suppose
it
awfully
gay
here
do
you
go
round
a
great
deal
with
the
american
set
undine
hesitated
for
a
fraction
of
a
moment
there
are
a
few
of
them
who
are
rather
jolly
but
i
particularly
want
you
to
meet
my
friend
the
marquis
roviano
he
from
rome
and
a
lovely
austrian
woman
baroness
adelschein
her
friend
face
was
brushed
by
a
shade
of
distrust
i
do
know
as
i
care
much
about
meeting
foreigners
she
said
indifferently
undine
smiled
it
was
agreeable
at
last
to
be
able
to
give
indiana
a
point
as
valuable
as
any
of
hers
on
divorce
oh
some
of
them
are
awfully
attractive
and
they
make
you
meet
the
americans
indiana
caught
this
on
the
bound
one
began
to
see
why
she
had
got
on
in
spite
of
everything
of
course
i
love
to
know
your
friends
she
said
kissing
undine
who
answered
giving
back
the
kiss
you
know
there
nothing
on
earth
i
would
do
for
you
indiana
drew
back
to
look
at
her
with
a
comic
grimace
under
which
a
shade
of
anxiety
was
visible
well
that
a
pretty
large
order
but
there
just
one
thing
you
can
do
dearest
please
to
let
rolliver
alone
rolliver
my
dear
undine
laugh
showed
that
she
took
this
for
unmixed
comedy
that
a
nice
way
to
remind
me
that
you
heaps
and
heaps
than
i
am
indiana
gave
her
an
acute
glance
millard
binch
did
think
so
not
even
at
the
very
end
oh
poor
millard
the
women
smiles
mingled
easily
over
the
common
reminiscence
and
once
again
on
the
threshold
undine
enfolded
her
friend
in
the
light
of
the
autumn
afternoon
she
paused
a
moment
at
the
door
of
the
nouveau
luxe
and
looked
aimlessly
forth
at
the
brave
spectacle
in
which
she
seemed
no
longer
to
have
a
stake
many
of
her
old
friends
had
already
returned
to
paris
the
harvey
shallums
may
beringer
dicky
bowles
and
other
nomads
lingering
on
for
a
glimpse
of
the
autumn
theatres
and
fashions
before
hurrying
back
to
inaugurate
the
new
york
season
a
year
ago
undine
would
have
had
no
difficulty
in
introducing
indiana
rolliver
to
this
group
a
group
above
which
her
own
aspirations
already
beat
an
impatient
wing
now
her
place
in
it
had
become
too
precarious
for
her
to
force
an
entrance
for
her
protectress
her
new
york
friends
were
at
no
pains
to
conceal
from
her
that
in
their
opinion
her
divorce
had
been
a
blunder
their
logic
was
that
of
apex
reversed
since
she
had
not
been
sure
of
van
degen
why
in
the
world
they
asked
had
she
thrown
away
a
position
she
was
sure
of
harvey
shallum
in
particular
had
not
scrupled
to
put
the
question
squarely
chelles
was
awfully
taken
he
would
have
introduced
you
everywhere
i
thought
you
were
wild
to
know
smart
french
people
i
thought
harvey
and
i
were
good
enough
for
you
any
longer
and
now
you
done
your
best
to
spoil
everything
of
course
i
feel
for
you
tremendously
that
the
reason
why
i
talking
so
frankly
you
must
be
horribly
depressed
come
and
dine
or
no
if
you
do
mind
i
rather
you
chose
another
evening
i
forgotten
that
i
asked
the
jim
driscolls
and
it
might
be
uncomfortable
for
you
in
another
world
she
was
still
welcome
at
first
perhaps
even
more
so
than
before
the
world
namely
to
which
she
had
proposed
to
present
indiana
rolliver
roviano
madame
adelschein
and
a
few
of
the
freer
spirits
of
her
old
moritz
band
reappearing
in
paris
with
the
close
of
the
season
had
quickly
discovered
her
and
shown
a
keen
interest
in
her
liberation
it
appeared
in
some
mysterious
way
to
make
her
more
available
for
their
purpose
and
she
found
that
in
the
character
of
the
last
american
divorcee
she
was
even
regarded
as
eligible
to
the
small
and
intimate
inner
circle
of
their
association
at
first
she
could
not
make
out
what
had
entitled
her
to
this
privilege
and
increasing
enlightenment
produced
a
revolt
of
the
apex
puritanism
which
despite
some
odd
accommodations
and
compliances
still
carried
its
head
so
high
in
her
undine
had
been
perfectly
sincere
in
telling
indiana
rolliver
that
she
was
not
an
immoral
woman
the
pleasures
for
which
her
sex
took
such
risks
had
never
attracted
her
and
she
did
not
even
crave
the
excitement
of
having
it
thought
that
they
did
she
wanted
passionately
and
persistently
two
things
which
she
believed
should
subsist
together
in
any
life
amusement
and
respectability
and
despite
her
her
notion
of
amusement
was
hardly
less
innocent
than
when
she
had
hung
on
the
plumber
fence
with
indiana
frusk
it
gave
her
therefore
no
satisfaction
to
find
herself
included
among
madame
adelschein
intimates
it
embarrassed
her
to
feel
that
she
was
expected
to
be
queer
and
different
to
respond
to
and
talk
in
innuendo
to
associate
with
the
equivocal
and
the
subterranean
and
affect
to
despise
the
ingenuous
daylight
joys
which
really
satisfied
her
soul
but
the
business
shrewdness
which
was
never
quite
dormant
in
her
suggested
that
this
was
not
the
moment
for
such
scruples
she
must
make
the
best
of
what
she
could
get
and
wait
her
chance
of
getting
something
better
and
meanwhile
the
most
practical
use
to
which
she
could
put
her
shady
friends
was
to
flash
their
authentic
nobility
in
the
dazzled
eyes
of
rolliver
with
this
object
in
view
she
made
haste
in
a
fashionable
of
the
rue
de
rivoli
to
group
about
indiana
the
most
titled
members
of
the
band
and
the
felicity
of
the
occasion
would
have
been
unmarred
had
she
not
suddenly
caught
sight
of
raymond
de
chelles
sitting
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
she
had
not
seen
chelles
since
her
return
to
paris
it
had
seemed
preferable
to
leave
their
meeting
to
chance
and
the
present
chance
might
have
served
as
well
as
another
but
for
the
fact
that
among
his
companions
were
two
or
three
of
the
most
eminent
ladies
of
the
proud
quarter
beyond
the
seine
it
was
what
undine
in
moments
of
discouragement
characterized
as
her
luck
that
one
of
these
should
be
the
hated
miss
wincher
of
potash
springs
who
had
now
become
the
marquise
de
trezac
undine
knew
that
chelles
and
his
compatriots
however
scandalized
at
her
european
companions
would
be
completely
indifferent
to
rolliver
appearance
but
one
gesture
of
madame
de
trezac
would
wave
indiana
to
her
place
and
thus
brand
the
whole
party
as
wrong
all
this
passed
through
undine
mind
in
the
very
moment
of
her
noting
the
change
of
expression
with
which
chelles
had
signalled
his
recognition
if
their
encounter
could
have
occurred
in
happier
conditions
it
might
have
had
results
as
it
was
the
crowded
state
of
the
and
the
distance
between
their
tables
sufficiently
excused
his
restricting
his
greeting
to
an
eager
bow
and
undine
went
home
from
this
first
attempt
to
reconstruct
her
past
her
spirits
were
not
lightened
by
the
developments
of
the
next
few
days
she
kept
herself
well
in
the
foreground
of
indiana
life
and
cultivated
toward
the
rolliver
a
manner
in
which
impersonal
admiration
for
the
statesman
was
tempered
with
the
politest
indifference
to
the
man
indiana
seemed
to
do
justice
to
her
efforts
and
to
be
reassured
by
the
result
but
still
there
came
no
hint
of
a
reward
for
a
time
undine
restrained
the
question
on
her
lips
but
one
afternoon
when
she
had
inducted
indiana
into
the
deepest
mysteries
of
parisian
the
importance
of
the
service
and
the
confidential
mood
it
engendered
seemed
to
warrant
a
discreet
allusion
to
their
bargain
indiana
leaned
back
among
her
cushions
with
an
embarrassed
laugh
oh
my
dear
i
been
meaning
to
tell
you
it
off
i
afraid
the
dinner
is
i
mean
you
see
van
degen
has
seen
you
with
me
and
the
very
minute
i
asked
him
to
come
and
dine
he
guessed
he
guessed
and
he
would
well
no
he
would
i
hate
to
tell
you
oh
undine
threw
off
a
vague
laugh
since
you
intimate
enough
for
him
to
tell
you
that
he
must
have
told
you
more
told
you
something
to
justify
his
behaviour
he
could
even
peter
van
degen
could
just
simply
have
said
to
you
wont
see
her
rolliver
hesitated
visibly
troubled
to
the
point
of
regretting
her
intervention
he
did
say
more
undine
insisted
he
gave
you
a
reason
he
said
you
know
oh
how
base
how
base
undine
was
trembling
with
one
of
her
rages
the
storms
of
destructive
fury
before
which
and
spragg
had
cowered
when
she
was
a
charming
cherub
but
life
had
administered
some
of
the
discipline
which
her
parents
had
spared
her
and
she
pulled
herself
together
with
a
gasp
of
pain
of
course
he
been
turned
against
me
his
wife
has
the
whole
of
new
york
behind
her
and
i
no
one
but
i
know
it
would
be
all
right
if
i
could
only
see
him
her
friend
made
no
answer
and
undine
pursued
with
an
irrepressible
outbreak
of
her
old
vehemence
indiana
rolliver
if
you
wo
do
it
for
me
i
go
straight
off
to
his
hotel
this
very
minute
i
wait
there
in
the
hall
till
he
sees
me
indiana
lifted
a
protesting
hand
do
undine
not
that
why
not
well
i
would
that
all
you
would
why
would
you
you
must
have
a
reason
undine
faced
her
with
levelled
brows
without
a
reason
you
ca
have
changed
so
utterly
since
our
last
talk
you
were
positive
enough
then
that
i
had
a
right
to
make
him
see
me
somewhat
to
her
surprise
indiana
made
no
effort
to
elude
the
challenge
yes
i
did
think
so
then
but
i
know
now
that
it
would
do
you
the
least
bit
of
good
have
they
turned
him
so
completely
against
me
i
do
care
if
they
have
i
know
him
i
can
get
him
back
that
the
trouble
indiana
shed
on
her
a
gaze
of
cold
compassion
it
not
that
any
one
has
turned
him
against
you
it
worse
than
that
what
can
be
you
hate
me
if
i
tell
you
then
you
better
make
him
tell
me
himself
i
ca
i
tried
to
the
trouble
is
that
it
was
you
something
you
did
i
mean
something
he
found
out
about
you
undine
to
restrain
a
spring
of
anger
had
to
clutch
both
arms
of
her
chair
about
me
how
fearfully
false
why
i
never
even
looked
at
anybody
it
nothing
of
that
kind
indiana
mournful
seemed
to
deplore
in
undine
an
unsuspected
moral
obtuseness
it
the
way
you
acted
to
your
own
husband
i
my
to
ralph
he
reproaches
me
for
that
peter
van
degen
does
well
for
one
particular
thing
he
says
that
the
very
day
you
went
off
with
him
last
year
you
got
a
cable
from
new
york
telling
you
to
come
back
at
once
to
marvell
who
was
desperately
how
on
earth
did
he
know
the
cry
escaped
undine
before
she
could
repress
it
it
true
then
indiana
exclaimed
oh
undine
undine
sat
speechless
and
motionless
the
anger
frozen
to
terror
on
her
lips
rolliver
turned
on
her
the
reproachful
gaze
of
the
deceived
benefactress
i
did
believe
it
when
he
told
me
i
never
have
thought
it
of
you
before
you
even
applied
for
your
divorce
undine
made
no
attempt
to
deny
the
charge
or
to
defend
herself
for
a
moment
she
was
lost
in
the
pursuit
of
an
unseizable
clue
the
explanation
of
this
monstrous
last
perversity
of
fate
suddenly
she
rose
to
her
feet
with
a
set
face
the
marvells
must
have
told
him
the
beasts
it
relieved
her
to
be
able
to
cry
it
out
it
was
your
husband
sister
what
did
you
say
her
name
was
when
you
did
answer
her
cable
she
cabled
van
degen
to
find
out
where
you
were
and
tell
you
to
come
straight
back
undine
stared
he
never
did
no
does
that
show
you
the
story
all
trumped
up
indiana
shook
her
head
he
said
nothing
to
you
about
it
because
he
was
with
you
when
you
received
the
first
cable
and
you
told
him
it
was
from
your
just
worrying
you
as
usual
to
go
home
and
when
he
asked
if
there
was
anything
else
in
it
you
said
there
was
another
thing
undine
intently
following
her
caught
at
this
with
a
spring
then
he
knew
it
all
along
he
admits
that
and
it
made
no
earthly
difference
to
him
at
the
time
she
turned
almost
victoriously
on
her
friend
did
he
happen
to
explain
that
i
wonder
yes
indiana
longanimity
grew
almost
solemn
it
came
over
him
gradually
he
said
one
day
when
he
was
feeling
very
well
he
thought
to
himself
she
act
like
that
to
me
if
i
was
dying
and
after
that
he
never
felt
the
same
to
you
indiana
lowered
her
empurpled
lids
men
have
their
feelings
too
even
when
they
carried
away
by
passion
after
a
pause
she
added
i
do
know
as
i
can
blame
him
undine
you
see
you
were
his
ideal
xxv
undine
marvell
for
the
next
few
months
tasted
all
the
accumulated
bitterness
of
failure
after
january
the
drifting
hordes
of
her
compatriots
had
scattered
to
the
four
quarters
of
the
globe
leaving
paris
to
resume
under
its
low
grey
sky
its
compacter
winter
personality
noting
from
her
more
and
more
deserted
corner
each
least
sign
of
the
social
revival
undine
felt
herself
as
stranded
and
baffled
as
after
the
ineffectual
summers
of
her
girlhood
she
was
not
without
possible
alternatives
but
the
sense
of
what
she
had
lost
took
the
savour
from
all
that
was
left
she
might
have
attached
herself
to
some
migratory
group
winged
for
italy
or
egypt
but
the
prospect
of
travel
did
not
in
itself
appeal
to
her
and
she
was
doubtful
of
its
social
benefit
she
lacked
the
adventurous
curiosity
which
seeks
its
occasion
in
the
unknown
and
though
she
could
work
doggedly
for
a
given
object
the
obstacles
to
be
overcome
had
to
be
as
distinct
as
the
prize
her
one
desire
was
to
get
back
an
equivalent
of
the
precise
value
she
had
lost
in
ceasing
to
be
ralph
marvell
wife
her
new
bearing
her
christian
name
in
place
of
her
husband
was
like
the
coin
of
a
debased
currency
testifying
to
her
diminished
trading
capacity
her
restricted
means
her
vacant
days
all
the
minor
irritations
of
her
life
were
as
nothing
compared
to
this
sense
of
a
lost
advantage
even
in
the
narrowed
field
of
a
parisian
winter
she
might
have
made
herself
a
place
in
some
more
or
less
world
but
her
experiments
in
this
line
gave
her
no
pleasure
proportioned
to
the
possible
derogation
she
feared
to
be
associated
with
the
wrong
people
and
scented
a
shade
of
disrespect
in
every
amicable
advance
the
more
pressing
attentions
of
one
or
two
men
she
had
formerly
known
filled
her
with
a
glow
of
outraged
pride
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
felt
that
even
solitude
might
be
preferable
to
certain
kinds
of
society
since
ill
health
was
the
most
plausible
pretext
for
seclusion
it
was
almost
a
relief
to
find
that
she
was
really
growing
nervous
and
sleeping
badly
the
doctor
she
summoned
advised
her
trying
a
small
quiet
place
on
the
riviera
not
too
near
the
sea
and
thither
in
the
early
days
of
december
she
transported
herself
with
her
maid
and
an
of
luggage
the
place
disconcerted
her
by
being
really
small
and
quiet
and
for
a
few
days
she
struggled
against
the
desire
for
flight
she
had
never
before
known
a
world
as
colourless
and
negative
as
that
of
the
large
white
hotel
where
everybody
went
to
bed
at
nine
and
over
stony
hills
were
the
only
alternative
to
slow
drives
along
dusty
roads
many
of
the
dwellers
in
this
temple
of
repose
found
even
these
exercises
too
stimulating
and
preferred
to
sit
for
hours
under
the
palms
in
the
garden
playing
patience
embroidering
or
reading
odd
volumes
of
tauchnitz
undine
driven
by
despair
to
an
inspection
of
the
hotel
discovered
that
scarcely
any
work
they
contained
was
complete
but
this
did
not
seem
to
trouble
the
readers
who
continued
to
feed
their
leisure
with
mutilated
fiction
from
which
they
occasionally
raised
their
eyes
to
glance
mistrustfully
at
the
new
arrival
sweeping
the
garden
gravel
with
her
frivolous
draperies
the
inmates
of
the
hotel
were
of
different
nationalities
but
their
racial
differences
were
levelled
by
the
stamp
of
a
common
mediocrity
all
differences
of
tongue
of
custom
of
physiognomy
disappeared
in
this
deep
community
of
insignificance
which
was
like
some
secret
bond
with
the
manifold
signs
and
of
its
ignorances
and
its
imperceptions
it
was
not
the
heterogeneous
mediocrity
of
the
american
summer
hotel
where
the
lack
of
any
standard
is
the
nearest
approach
to
a
tie
but
an
organized
codified
dulness
in
conscious
possession
of
its
rights
and
strong
in
the
voluntary
ignorance
of
any
others
it
took
undine
a
long
time
to
accustom
herself
to
such
an
atmosphere
and
meanwhile
she
fretted
fumed
and
flaunted
or
abandoned
herself
to
long
periods
of
fruitless
brooding
sometimes
a
flame
of
anger
shot
up
in
her
dismally
illuminating
the
path
she
had
travelled
and
the
blank
wall
to
which
it
led
at
other
moments
past
and
present
were
enveloped
in
a
dull
fog
of
rancour
which
distorted
and
faded
even
the
image
she
presented
to
her
morning
mirror
there
were
days
when
every
young
face
she
saw
left
in
her
a
taste
of
poison
but
when
she
compared
herself
with
the
specimens
of
her
sex
who
plied
their
languid
industries
under
the
palms
or
looked
away
as
she
passed
them
in
hall
or
staircase
her
spirits
rose
and
she
rang
for
her
maid
and
dressed
herself
in
her
newest
and
vividest
these
were
unprofitable
triumphs
however
she
never
made
one
of
her
attacks
on
the
organized
disapproval
of
the
community
without
feeling
she
had
lost
ground
by
it
and
the
next
day
she
would
lie
in
bed
and
send
down
capricious
orders
for
food
which
her
maid
would
presently
remove
untouched
with
instructions
to
transmit
her
complaints
to
the
landlord
sometimes
the
events
of
the
past
year
ceaselessly
revolving
through
her
brain
became
no
longer
a
subject
for
criticism
or
justification
but
simply
a
series
of
pictures
monotonously
unrolled
hour
by
hour
in
such
moods
she
the
incidents
of
her
flight
with
peter
van
degen
the
part
of
her
career
that
since
it
had
proved
a
failure
seemed
least
like
herself
and
most
difficult
to
justify
she
had
gone
away
with
him
and
had
lived
with
him
for
two
months
she
undine
marvell
to
whom
respectability
was
the
breath
of
life
to
whom
such
follies
had
always
been
unintelligible
and
therefore
she
had
done
this
incredible
thing
and
she
had
done
it
from
a
motive
that
seemed
at
the
time
as
clear
as
logical
as
free
from
the
distorting
mists
of
sentimentality
as
any
of
her
father
financial
enterprises
it
had
been
a
bold
move
but
it
had
been
as
carefully
calculated
as
the
happiest
wall
street
stroke
she
had
gone
away
with
peter
because
after
the
decisive
scene
in
which
she
had
put
her
power
to
the
test
to
yield
to
him
seemed
the
surest
means
of
victory
even
to
her
practical
intelligence
it
was
clear
that
an
immediate
dash
to
dakota
might
look
too
calculated
and
she
had
preserved
her
by
telling
herself
that
she
was
really
his
wife
and
in
no
way
to
blame
if
the
law
delayed
to
ratify
the
bond
she
was
still
persuaded
of
the
justness
of
her
reasoning
but
she
now
saw
that
it
had
left
certain
risks
out
of
account
her
life
with
van
degen
had
taught
her
many
things
the
two
had
wandered
from
place
to
place
spending
a
great
deal
of
money
always
more
and
more
money
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
had
been
able
to
buy
everything
she
wanted
for
a
while
this
had
kept
her
amused
and
busy
but
presently
she
began
to
perceive
that
her
companion
view
of
their
relation
was
not
the
same
as
hers
she
saw
that
he
had
always
meant
it
to
be
an
unavowed
tie
screened
by
shallum
companionship
and
clare
careless
tolerance
and
that
on
those
terms
he
would
have
been
ready
to
shed
on
their
adventure
the
brightest
blaze
of
notoriety
but
since
undine
had
insisted
on
being
carried
off
like
a
sentimental
he
meant
to
shroud
the
affair
in
mystery
and
was
as
zealous
in
concealing
their
relation
as
she
was
bent
on
proclaiming
it
in
the
powerful
novels
which
popple
was
fond
of
lending
her
she
had
met
with
increasing
frequency
the
type
of
heroine
who
scorns
to
love
clandestinely
and
proclaims
the
sanctity
of
passion
and
the
moral
duty
of
obeying
its
call
undine
had
been
struck
by
these
arguments
as
justifying
and
even
ennobling
her
course
and
had
let
peter
understand
that
she
had
been
actuated
by
the
highest
motives
in
openly
associating
her
life
with
his
but
he
had
opposed
a
placid
insensibility
to
these
allusions
and
had
persisted
in
treating
her
as
though
their
journey
were
the
kind
of
escapade
that
a
man
of
the
world
is
bound
to
hide
she
had
expected
him
to
take
her
to
all
the
showy
places
where
couples
like
themselves
are
relieved
from
a
too
sustained
contemplation
of
nature
by
the
distractions
of
the
restaurant
and
the
but
he
had
carried
her
from
one
obscure
corner
of
europe
to
another
shunning
fashionable
hotels
and
crowded
and
displaying
an
ingenuity
in
the
discovery
of
the
unvisited
and
the
that
gave
their
journey
an
odd
resemblance
to
her
melancholy
she
had
never
for
a
moment
ceased
to
remember
that
the
dakota
was
the
objective
point
of
this
later
honeymoon
and
her
allusions
to
the
fact
were
as
frequent
as
prudence
permitted
peter
seemed
in
no
way
disturbed
by
them
he
responded
with
expressions
of
increasing
tenderness
or
the
purchase
of
another
piece
of
jewelry
and
though
undine
could
not
remember
his
ever
voluntarily
bringing
the
subject
of
their
marriage
he
did
not
shrink
from
her
recurring
mention
of
it
he
seemed
merely
too
steeped
in
present
to
think
of
the
future
and
she
ascribed
this
to
the
fact
that
his
faculty
of
enjoyment
could
not
project
itself
beyond
the
moment
her
business
was
to
make
each
of
their
days
so
agreeable
that
when
the
last
came
he
should
be
conscious
of
a
void
to
be
bridged
over
as
rapidly
as
possible
and
when
she
thought
this
point
had
been
reached
she
packed
her
trunks
and
started
for
dakota
the
next
picture
to
follow
was
that
of
the
dull
months
in
the
western
where
to
escape
loneliness
and
avoid
comment
she
had
cast
in
her
lot
with
mabel
lipscomb
who
had
lately
arrived
there
on
the
same
errand
undine
at
the
outset
had
been
sorry
for
the
friend
whose
new
venture
seemed
likely
to
result
so
much
less
brilliantly
than
her
own
but
compassion
had
been
replaced
by
irritation
as
mabel
unpruned
vulgarities
her
enormous
encroaching
satisfaction
with
herself
and
her
surroundings
began
to
pervade
every
corner
of
their
provisional
household
undine
during
the
first
months
of
her
exile
had
been
sustained
by
the
fullest
confidence
in
her
future
when
she
had
parted
from
van
degen
she
had
felt
sure
he
meant
to
marry
her
and
the
fact
that
lipscomb
was
fortified
by
no
similar
hope
made
her
easier
to
bear
with
undine
was
almost
ashamed
that
the
unwooed
mabel
should
be
the
witness
of
her
own
felicity
and
planned
to
send
her
off
on
a
trip
to
denver
when
peter
should
announce
his
arrival
but
the
weeks
passed
and
peter
did
not
come
mabel
on
the
whole
behaved
well
in
this
contingency
undine
in
her
first
exultation
had
confided
all
her
hopes
and
plans
to
her
friend
but
mabel
took
no
undue
advantage
of
the
confidence
she
was
even
tactful
in
her
loud
fond
clumsy
way
with
a
tact
that
insistently
boomed
and
buzzed
about
its
victim
head
but
one
day
she
mentioned
that
she
had
asked
to
dinner
a
gentleman
from
little
rock
who
had
come
to
dakota
with
the
same
object
as
themselves
and
whose
acquaintance
she
had
made
through
her
lawyer
the
gentleman
from
little
rock
came
to
dine
and
within
a
week
undine
understood
that
mabel
future
was
assured
if
van
degen
had
been
at
hand
undine
would
have
smiled
with
him
at
poor
mabel
infatuation
and
her
suitor
crudeness
but
van
degen
was
not
there
he
made
no
sign
he
sent
no
excuse
he
simply
continued
to
absent
himself
and
it
was
undine
who
in
due
course
had
to
make
way
for
lipscomb
caller
and
sit
upstairs
with
a
novel
while
the
below
was
given
up
to
the
enacting
of
an
actual
even
then
even
to
the
end
undine
had
to
admit
that
mabel
had
behaved
beautifully
but
it
is
comparatively
easy
to
behave
beautifully
when
one
is
getting
what
one
wants
and
when
some
one
else
who
has
not
always
been
altogether
kind
is
not
the
net
result
of
magnanimity
was
that
when
on
the
day
of
parting
she
drew
undine
to
her
bosom
with
the
hand
on
which
her
new
blazed
undine
hated
her
as
she
hated
everything
else
connected
with
her
vain
exile
in
the
wilderness
xxvi
the
next
phase
in
the
unrolling
vision
was
the
episode
of
her
return
to
new
york
she
had
gone
to
the
malibran
to
her
parents
for
it
was
a
moment
in
her
career
when
she
clung
passionately
to
the
conformities
and
when
the
fact
of
being
able
to
say
i
here
with
my
father
and
mother
was
worth
paying
for
even
in
the
discomfort
of
that
grim
abode
nevertheless
it
was
another
thorn
in
her
pride
that
her
parents
could
not
for
the
meanest
of
material
reasons
transfer
themselves
at
her
coming
to
one
of
the
big
fifth
avenue
hotels
when
she
had
suggested
it
spragg
had
briefly
replied
that
owing
to
the
heavy
expenses
of
her
divorce
suit
he
could
for
the
moment
afford
anything
better
and
this
announcement
cast
a
deeper
gloom
over
the
future
it
was
not
an
occasion
for
being
nervous
however
she
had
learned
too
many
hard
facts
in
the
last
few
months
to
think
of
having
recourse
to
her
youthful
methods
and
something
told
her
that
if
she
made
the
attempt
it
would
be
useless
her
father
and
mother
seemed
much
older
seemed
tired
and
defeated
like
herself
parents
and
daughter
bore
their
common
failure
in
a
common
silence
broken
only
by
spragg
occasional
tentative
allusions
to
her
grandson
but
her
anecdotes
of
paul
left
a
deeper
silence
behind
them
undine
did
not
want
to
talk
of
her
boy
she
could
forget
him
when
as
she
put
it
things
were
going
her
way
but
in
moments
of
discouragement
the
thought
of
him
was
an
added
bitterness
subtly
different
from
her
other
bitter
thoughts
and
harder
to
quiet
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
to
try
to
gain
possession
of
the
child
she
was
vaguely
aware
that
the
courts
had
given
her
his
custody
but
she
had
never
seriously
thought
of
asserting
this
claim
her
parents
diminished
means
and
her
own
uncertain
future
made
her
regard
the
care
of
paul
as
an
additional
burden
and
she
quieted
her
scruples
by
thinking
of
him
as
better
off
with
ralph
family
and
of
herself
as
rather
touchingly
disinterested
in
putting
his
welfare
before
her
own
poor
spragg
was
pining
for
him
but
undine
rejected
her
artless
suggestion
that
heeny
should
be
sent
to
bring
him
round
i
would
ask
them
a
favour
for
the
world
they
just
waiting
for
a
chance
to
be
hateful
to
me
she
scornfully
declared
but
it
pained
her
that
her
boy
should
be
so
near
yet
inaccessible
and
for
the
first
time
she
was
visited
by
unwonted
questionings
as
to
her
share
in
the
misfortunes
that
had
befallen
her
she
had
voluntarily
stepped
out
of
her
social
frame
and
the
only
person
on
whom
she
could
with
any
satisfaction
have
laid
the
blame
was
the
person
to
whom
her
mind
now
turned
with
a
belated
tenderness
it
was
thus
in
fact
that
she
thought
of
ralph
his
pride
his
reserve
all
the
secret
expressions
of
his
devotion
the
tones
of
his
voice
his
quiet
manner
even
his
disconcerting
irony
these
seemed
in
contrast
to
what
she
had
since
known
the
qualities
essential
to
her
happiness
she
could
console
herself
only
by
regarding
it
as
part
of
her
sad
lot
that
poverty
and
the
relentless
animosity
of
his
family
should
have
put
an
end
to
so
perfect
a
union
she
gradually
began
to
look
on
herself
and
ralph
as
the
victims
of
dark
machinations
and
when
she
mentioned
him
she
spoke
forgivingly
and
implied
that
everything
might
have
been
different
if
people
had
not
come
between
them
she
had
arrived
in
new
york
in
midseason
and
the
dread
of
seeing
familiar
faces
kept
her
shut
up
in
her
room
at
the
malibran
reading
novels
and
brooding
over
possibilities
of
escape
she
tried
to
avoid
the
daily
papers
but
they
formed
the
staple
diet
of
her
parents
and
now
and
then
she
could
not
help
taking
one
up
and
turning
to
the
society
column
its
perusal
produced
the
impression
that
the
season
must
be
the
gayest
new
york
had
ever
known
the
harmon
driscolls
young
jim
and
his
wife
the
thurber
van
degens
the
chauncey
ellings
and
all
the
other
fifth
avenue
potentates
seemed
to
have
their
doors
perpetually
open
to
a
stream
of
feasters
among
whom
the
familiar
presences
of
grace
beringer
bertha
shallum
dicky
bowles
and
claud
walsingham
popple
came
and
went
with
the
irritating
sameness
of
the
figures
in
a
among
them
also
peter
van
degen
presently
appeared
he
had
been
on
a
tour
around
the
world
and
undine
could
not
look
at
a
newspaper
without
seeing
some
allusion
to
his
progress
after
his
return
she
noticed
that
his
name
was
usually
coupled
with
his
wife
he
and
clare
seemed
to
be
celebrating
his
in
a
series
of
festivities
and
undine
guessed
that
he
had
reasons
for
wishing
to
keep
before
the
world
the
evidences
of
his
conjugal
accord
heeny
clippings
supplied
her
with
such
items
as
her
own
reading
missed
and
one
day
the
masseuse
appeared
with
a
long
article
from
the
leading
journal
of
little
rock
describing
the
brilliant
nuptials
of
mabel
lipscomb
now
homer
branney
and
her
departure
for
the
coast
in
the
bridegroom
private
car
this
put
the
last
touch
to
undine
irritation
and
the
next
morning
she
got
up
earlier
than
usual
put
on
her
most
effective
dress
went
for
a
quick
walk
around
the
park
and
told
her
father
when
she
came
in
that
she
wanted
him
to
take
her
to
the
opera
that
evening
spragg
stared
and
frowned
you
mean
you
want
me
to
go
round
and
hire
a
box
for
you
oh
no
undine
coloured
at
the
infelicitous
allusion
besides
she
knew
now
that
the
smart
people
who
were
musical
went
in
stalls
i
only
want
two
good
seats
i
do
see
why
i
should
stay
shut
up
i
want
you
to
go
with
me
she
added
her
father
received
the
latter
part
of
the
request
without
comment
he
seemed
to
have
gone
beyond
surprise
but
he
appeared
that
evening
at
dinner
in
a
creased
and
loosely
fitting
which
he
had
probably
not
put
on
since
the
last
time
he
had
dined
with
his
and
he
and
undine
drove
off
together
leaving
spragg
to
gaze
after
them
with
the
pale
stare
of
hecuba
their
stalls
were
in
the
middle
of
the
house
and
around
them
swept
the
great
curve
of
boxes
at
which
undine
had
so
often
looked
up
in
the
remote
stentorian
days
then
all
had
been
one
indistinguishable
glitter
now
the
scene
was
full
of
familiar
details
the
house
was
thronged
with
people
she
knew
and
every
box
seemed
to
contain
a
parcel
of
her
past
at
first
she
had
shrunk
from
recognition
but
gradually
as
she
perceived
that
no
one
noticed
her
that
she
was
merely
part
of
the
invisible
crowd
out
of
range
of
the
exploring
opera
glasses
she
felt
a
defiant
desire
to
make
herself
seen
when
the
performance
was
over
her
father
wanted
to
leave
the
house
by
the
door
at
which
they
had
entered
but
she
guided
him
toward
the
stockholders
entrance
and
pressed
her
way
among
the
furred
and
jewelled
ladies
waiting
for
their
motors
oh
it
the
wrong
door
never
mind
we
walk
to
the
corner
and
get
a
cab
she
exclaimed
speaking
loudly
enough
to
be
overheard
two
or
three
heads
turned
and
she
met
dicky
bowles
glance
and
returned
his
laughing
bow
the
woman
talking
to
him
looked
around
coloured
slightly
and
made
a
barely
perceptible
motion
of
her
head
just
beyond
her
chauncey
elling
plumed
and
purple
stared
parted
her
lips
and
turned
to
say
something
important
to
young
jim
driscoll
who
looked
up
involuntarily
and
then
squared
his
shoulders
and
gazed
fixedly
at
a
distant
point
as
people
do
at
a
funeral
behind
them
undine
caught
sight
of
clare
van
degen
she
stood
alone
and
her
face
was
pale
and
listless
shall
i
go
up
and
speak
to
her
undine
wondered
some
intuition
told
her
that
alone
of
all
the
women
present
clare
might
have
greeted
her
kindly
but
she
hung
back
and
harmon
driscoll
surged
by
on
popple
arm
popple
crimsoned
coughed
and
signalled
despotically
to
driscoll
footman
over
his
shoulder
undine
received
a
bow
from
charles
bowen
and
behind
bowen
she
saw
two
or
three
other
men
she
knew
and
read
in
their
faces
surprise
curiosity
and
the
wish
to
show
their
pleasure
at
seeing
her
but
she
grasped
her
arm
and
drew
him
out
among
the
entangled
motors
and
vociferating
policemen
neither
she
nor
spragg
spoke
a
word
on
the
way
home
but
when
they
reached
the
malibran
her
father
followed
her
up
to
her
room
she
had
dropped
her
cloak
and
stood
before
the
wardrobe
mirror
studying
her
reflection
when
he
came
up
behind
her
and
she
saw
that
he
was
looking
at
it
too
where
did
that
necklace
come
from
undine
neck
grew
pink
under
the
shining
circlet
it
was
the
first
time
since
her
return
to
new
york
that
she
had
put
on
a
low
dress
and
thus
uncovered
the
string
of
pearls
she
always
wore
she
made
no
answer
and
spragg
continued
did
your
husband
give
them
to
you
ralph
she
could
not
restrain
a
laugh
who
did
then
undine
remained
silent
she
really
had
not
thought
about
the
pearls
except
in
so
far
as
she
consciously
enjoyed
the
pleasure
of
possessing
them
and
her
father
habitually
so
unobservant
had
seemed
the
last
person
likely
to
raise
the
awkward
question
of
their
origin
why
she
began
without
knowing
what
she
meant
to
say
i
guess
you
better
send
back
to
the
party
they
belong
to
spragg
continued
in
a
voice
she
did
not
know
they
belong
to
me
she
flamed
up
he
looked
at
her
as
if
she
had
grown
suddenly
small
and
insignificant
you
better
send
back
to
peter
van
degen
the
first
thing
morning
he
said
as
he
went
out
of
the
room
as
far
as
undine
could
remember
it
was
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
he
had
ever
ordered
her
to
do
anything
and
when
the
door
closed
on
him
she
had
the
distinct
sense
that
the
question
had
closed
with
it
and
that
she
would
have
to
obey
she
took
the
pearls
off
and
threw
them
from
her
angrily
the
humiliation
her
father
had
inflicted
on
her
was
merged
with
the
humiliation
to
which
she
had
subjected
herself
in
going
to
the
opera
and
she
had
never
before
hated
her
life
as
she
hated
it
then
all
night
she
lay
sleepless
wondering
miserably
what
to
do
and
out
of
her
hatred
of
her
life
and
her
hatred
of
peter
van
degen
there
gradually
grew
a
loathing
of
van
degen
pearls
how
could
she
have
kept
them
how
have
continued
to
wear
them
about
her
neck
only
her
absorption
in
other
cares
could
have
kept
her
from
feeling
the
humiliation
of
carrying
about
with
her
the
price
of
her
shame
her
had
filled
her
mind
with
the
vocabulary
of
outraged
virtue
and
with
pathetic
allusions
to
woman
frailty
and
while
she
pitied
herself
she
thought
her
father
heroic
she
was
proud
to
think
that
she
had
such
a
man
to
defend
her
and
rejoiced
that
it
was
in
her
power
to
express
her
scorn
of
van
degen
by
sending
back
his
jewels
but
her
righteous
ardour
gradually
cooled
and
she
was
left
once
more
to
face
the
dreary
problem
of
the
future
her
evening
at
the
opera
had
shown
her
the
impossibility
of
remaining
in
new
york
she
had
neither
the
skill
nor
the
power
to
fight
the
forces
of
indifference
leagued
against
her
she
must
get
away
at
once
and
try
to
make
a
fresh
start
but
as
usual
the
lack
of
money
hampered
her
spragg
could
no
longer
afford
to
make
her
the
allowance
she
had
intermittently
received
from
him
during
the
first
years
of
her
marriage
and
since
she
was
now
without
child
or
household
she
could
hardly
make
it
a
grievance
that
he
had
reduced
her
income
but
what
he
allowed
her
even
with
the
addition
of
her
alimony
was
absurdly
insufficient
not
that
she
looked
far
ahead
she
had
always
felt
herself
predestined
to
ease
and
luxury
and
the
possibility
of
a
future
adapted
to
her
present
budget
did
not
occur
to
her
but
she
desperately
wanted
enough
money
to
carry
her
without
anxiety
through
the
coming
year
when
her
breakfast
tray
was
brought
in
she
sent
it
away
untouched
and
continued
to
lie
in
her
darkened
room
she
knew
that
when
she
got
up
she
must
send
back
the
pearls
but
there
was
no
longer
any
satisfaction
in
the
thought
and
she
lay
listlessly
wondering
how
she
could
best
transmit
them
to
van
degen
as
she
lay
there
she
heard
heeny
voice
in
the
passage
hitherto
she
had
avoided
the
masseuse
as
she
did
every
one
else
associated
with
her
past
heeny
had
behaved
with
extreme
discretion
refraining
from
all
direct
allusions
to
undine
misadventure
but
her
silence
was
obviously
the
criticism
of
a
superior
mind
once
again
undine
had
disregarded
her
injunction
to
go
slow
with
results
that
justified
the
warning
heeny
very
reserve
however
now
marked
her
as
a
safe
adviser
and
undine
sprang
up
and
called
her
in
my
sakes
undine
you
look
if
you
been
setting
up
all
night
with
a
remains
the
masseuse
exclaimed
in
her
round
rich
tones
undine
without
answering
caught
up
the
pearls
and
thrust
them
into
heeny
hands
good
land
alive
the
masseuse
dropped
into
a
chair
and
let
the
twist
slip
through
her
fat
flexible
fingers
well
you
got
a
fortune
right
round
your
neck
whenever
you
wear
them
undine
spragg
undine
murmured
something
indistinguishable
i
want
you
to
take
them
she
began
take
where
to
why
to
she
was
checked
by
the
wondering
simplicity
of
stare
the
masseuse
must
know
where
the
pearls
had
come
from
yet
it
had
evidently
not
occurred
to
her
that
marvell
was
about
to
ask
her
to
return
them
to
their
donor
in
the
light
of
heeny
unclouded
gaze
the
whole
episode
took
on
a
different
aspect
and
undine
began
to
be
vaguely
astonished
at
her
immediate
submission
to
her
father
will
the
pearls
were
hers
after
all
to
be
heeny
placidly
suggested
why
you
oughter
to
have
it
done
right
here
before
your
eyes
with
pearls
that
are
worth
what
these
are
as
undine
listened
a
new
thought
shaped
itself
she
could
not
continue
to
wear
the
pearls
the
idea
had
become
intolerable
but
for
the
first
time
she
saw
what
they
might
be
converted
into
and
what
they
might
rescue
her
from
and
suddenly
she
brought
out
do
you
suppose
i
could
get
anything
for
them
get
anything
why
what
anything
like
what
they
worth
i
mean
they
cost
a
lot
of
money
they
came
from
the
biggest
place
in
paris
under
simplifying
eye
it
was
comparatively
easy
to
make
these
explanations
i
want
you
to
try
and
sell
them
for
me
i
want
you
to
do
the
best
you
can
with
them
i
ca
do
it
myself
but
you
must
swear
you
never
tell
a
soul
she
pressed
on
breathlessly
why
you
poor
child
it
ai
the
first
time
said
heeny
coiling
the
pearls
in
her
big
palm
it
a
pity
too
they
such
beauties
but
you
get
others
she
added
as
the
necklace
vanished
into
her
bag
a
few
days
later
there
appeared
from
the
same
receptacle
a
bundle
of
banknotes
considerable
enough
to
quiet
undine
last
scruples
she
no
longer
understood
why
she
had
hesitated
why
should
she
have
thought
it
necessary
to
give
back
the
pearls
to
van
degen
his
obligation
to
her
represented
far
more
than
the
relatively
small
sum
she
had
been
able
to
realize
on
the
necklace
she
hid
the
money
in
her
dress
and
when
heeny
had
gone
on
to
spragg
room
she
drew
the
packet
out
and
counting
the
bills
over
murmured
to
herself
now
i
can
get
away
her
one
thought
was
to
return
to
europe
but
she
did
not
want
to
go
alone
the
vision
of
her
solitary
figure
adrift
in
the
spring
mob
of
depressed
and
mortified
her
she
would
be
sure
to
run
across
acquaintances
and
they
would
infer
that
she
was
in
quest
of
a
new
opportunity
a
fresh
start
and
would
suspect
her
of
trying
to
use
them
for
the
purpose
the
thought
was
repugnant
to
her
newly
awakened
pride
and
she
decided
that
if
she
went
to
europe
her
father
and
mother
must
go
with
her
the
project
was
a
bold
one
and
when
she
broached
it
she
had
to
run
the
whole
gamut
of
spragg
irony
he
wanted
to
know
what
she
expected
to
do
with
him
when
she
got
him
there
whether
she
meant
to
introduce
him
to
all
those
old
kings
how
she
thought
he
and
her
mother
would
look
in
court
dress
and
how
she
supposed
he
was
going
to
get
on
without
his
new
york
paper
but
undine
had
been
aware
of
having
what
he
himself
would
have
called
a
pull
over
her
father
since
the
day
after
their
visit
to
the
opera
he
had
taken
her
aside
to
ask
you
sent
back
those
pearls
and
she
had
answered
coldly
heeny
taken
them
after
a
moment
of
resistance
her
parents
perhaps
secretly
flattered
by
this
first
expression
of
her
need
for
them
had
yielded
to
her
entreaty
packed
their
trunks
and
stoically
set
out
for
the
unknown
neither
spragg
nor
his
wife
had
ever
before
been
out
of
their
country
and
undine
had
not
understood
till
they
stood
beside
her
and
helpless
on
the
dock
at
cherbourg
the
task
she
had
undertaken
in
uprooting
them
spragg
had
never
been
physically
active
but
on
foreign
shores
he
was
seized
by
a
strange
restlessness
and
a
helpless
dependence
on
his
daughter
spragg
long
habit
of
apathy
was
overcome
by
her
dread
of
being
left
alone
when
her
husband
and
undine
went
out
and
she
delayed
and
impeded
their
expeditions
by
insisting
on
accompanying
them
so
that
much
as
undine
disliked
sightseeing
there
seemed
no
alternative
between
going
round
with
her
parents
and
shutting
herself
up
with
them
in
the
crowded
hotels
to
which
she
successively
transported
them
the
hotels
were
the
only
european
institutions
that
really
interested
spragg
he
considered
them
manifestly
inferior
to
those
at
home
but
he
was
haunted
by
a
statistical
curiosity
as
to
their
size
their
number
their
cost
and
their
capacity
for
housing
and
feeding
the
incalculable
hordes
of
his
countrymen
he
went
through
galleries
churches
and
museums
in
a
stolid
silence
like
his
daughter
but
in
the
hotels
he
never
ceased
to
enquire
and
investigate
questioning
every
one
who
could
speak
english
comparing
bills
collecting
prospectuses
and
computing
the
cost
of
construction
and
the
probable
return
on
the
investment
he
regarded
the
of
the
system
as
one
more
proof
of
european
inferiority
and
no
longer
wondered
in
the
absence
of
the
telephone
that
foreigners
had
yet
mastered
the
first
principles
of
after
a
few
weeks
it
became
evident
to
both
parents
and
daughter
that
their
unnatural
association
could
not
continue
much
longer
spragg
shrinking
from
everything
new
and
unfamiliar
had
developed
into
a
kind
of
settled
terror
and
spragg
had
begun
to
be
depressed
by
the
incredible
number
of
the
hotels
and
their
simply
incalculable
housing
capacity
it
ai
that
they
any
great
shakes
in
themselves
any
one
of
but
there
such
a
darned
lot
of
they
as
thick
as
mosquitoes
every
place
you
go
and
he
began
to
reckon
up
on
slips
of
paper
on
the
backs
of
bills
and
the
margins
of
old
newspapers
the
number
of
travellers
who
could
be
simultaneously
lodged
bathed
and
boarded
on
the
continent
of
europe
five
hundred
bedrooms
three
hundred
bathrooms
no
three
hundred
and
fifty
bathrooms
that
one
has
that
makes
supposing
of
double
up
do
you
as
many
as
that
do
undie
that
porter
at
lucerne
told
me
the
germans
slept
three
in
a
room
well
call
it
eight
hundred
people
and
three
meals
a
day
per
head
no
four
meals
with
that
afternoon
tea
they
take
and
the
last
place
we
were
at
up
on
that
mountain
there
why
there
were
hotels
in
that
one
spot
alone
and
all
jam
full
well
it
beats
me
to
know
where
all
the
people
come
from
he
had
gone
on
in
this
fashion
for
what
seemed
to
his
daughter
an
endless
length
of
days
and
then
suddenly
he
had
roused
himself
to
say
see
here
undie
i
got
to
go
back
and
make
the
money
to
pay
for
all
this
there
had
been
no
question
on
the
part
of
any
of
the
three
of
returning
with
them
and
after
she
had
conveyed
them
to
their
steamer
and
seen
their
vaguely
relieved
faces
merged
in
the
throng
along
the
taffrail
she
had
returned
alone
to
paris
and
made
her
unsuccessful
attempt
to
enlist
the
aid
of
indiana
rolliver
xxvii
she
was
still
brooding
over
this
last
failure
when
one
afternoon
as
she
loitered
on
the
hotel
terrace
she
was
approached
by
a
young
woman
whom
she
had
seen
sitting
near
the
wheeled
chair
of
an
old
lady
wearing
a
crumpled
black
bonnet
under
a
funny
fringed
parasol
with
a
jointed
handle
the
young
woman
who
was
small
slight
and
brown
was
dressed
with
a
disregard
of
the
fashion
which
contrasted
oddly
with
the
mauve
powder
on
her
face
and
the
traces
of
artificial
colour
in
her
dark
untidy
hair
she
looked
as
if
she
might
have
several
different
personalities
and
as
if
the
one
of
the
moment
had
been
hanging
up
a
long
time
in
her
wardrobe
and
been
hurriedly
taken
down
as
probably
good
enough
for
the
present
occasion
with
her
hands
in
her
jacket
pockets
and
an
agreeable
smile
on
her
boyish
face
she
strolled
up
to
undine
and
asked
in
a
pretty
variety
of
parisian
english
if
she
had
the
pleasure
of
speaking
to
marvell
on
undine
assenting
the
smile
grew
more
alert
and
the
lady
continued
i
think
you
know
my
friend
sacha
adelschein
no
question
could
have
been
less
welcome
to
undine
if
there
was
one
point
on
which
she
was
doggedly
and
puritanically
resolved
it
was
that
no
extremes
of
social
adversity
should
ever
again
draw
her
into
the
group
of
people
among
whom
madame
adelschein
too
conspicuously
figured
since
her
unsuccessful
attempt
to
win
over
indiana
by
introducing
her
to
that
group
undine
had
been
righteously
resolved
to
remain
aloof
from
it
and
she
was
drawing
herself
up
to
her
loftiest
height
of
disapproval
when
the
stranger
as
if
unconscious
of
it
went
on
sacha
speaks
of
you
so
often
she
admires
you
so
i
think
you
know
also
my
cousin
chelles
she
added
looking
into
undine
eyes
i
am
the
princess
estradina
i
come
here
with
my
mother
for
the
air
the
murmur
of
negation
died
on
undine
lips
she
found
herself
grappling
with
a
new
social
riddle
and
such
surprises
were
always
stimulating
the
name
of
the
young
woman
she
had
been
about
to
repel
was
one
of
the
most
eminent
in
the
impregnable
quarter
beyond
the
seine
no
one
figured
more
largely
in
the
parisian
chronicle
than
the
princess
estradina
and
no
name
more
impressively
headed
the
list
at
every
marriage
funeral
and
philanthropic
entertainment
of
the
faubourg
saint
germain
than
that
of
her
mother
the
duchesse
de
dordogne
who
must
be
no
other
than
the
old
woman
sitting
in
the
with
the
crumpled
bonnet
and
the
ridiculous
sunshade
but
it
was
not
the
appearance
of
the
two
ladies
that
surprised
undine
she
knew
that
social
gold
does
not
always
glitter
and
that
the
lady
she
had
heard
spoken
of
as
lili
estradina
was
notoriously
careless
of
the
conventions
but
that
she
should
boast
of
her
intimacy
with
madame
adelschein
and
use
it
as
a
pretext
for
naming
herself
overthrew
all
undine
hierarchies
yes
it
hideously
dull
here
and
i
dying
of
it
do
come
over
and
speak
to
my
mother
she
dying
of
it
too
but
do
tell
her
so
because
she
has
found
it
out
there
were
so
many
things
our
mothers
never
found
out
the
princess
rambled
on
with
her
smile
and
in
another
moment
undine
thrilled
at
having
spragg
thus
coupled
with
a
duchess
found
herself
seated
between
mother
and
daughter
and
responding
by
a
radiant
blush
to
the
elder
lady
amiable
opening
you
know
my
nephew
raymond
he
your
great
admirer
how
had
it
happened
whither
would
it
lead
how
long
could
it
last
the
questions
raced
through
undine
brain
as
she
sat
listening
to
her
new
friends
they
seemed
already
too
friendly
to
be
called
acquaintances
replying
to
their
enquiries
and
trying
to
think
far
enough
ahead
to
guess
what
they
would
expect
her
to
say
and
what
tone
it
would
be
well
to
take
she
was
used
to
such
feats
of
mental
agility
and
it
was
instinctive
with
her
to
become
for
the
moment
the
person
she
thought
her
interlocutors
expected
her
to
be
but
she
had
never
had
quite
so
new
a
part
to
play
at
such
short
notice
she
took
her
cue
however
from
the
fact
that
the
princess
estradina
in
her
presence
made
no
farther
allusion
to
her
dear
friend
sacha
and
seemed
somehow
though
she
continued
to
chat
on
in
the
same
easy
strain
to
look
differently
and
throw
out
different
implications
all
these
shades
of
demeanour
were
immediately
perceptible
to
undine
who
tried
to
adapt
herself
to
them
by
combining
in
her
manner
a
mixture
of
apex
dash
and
new
york
dignity
and
the
result
was
so
successful
that
when
she
rose
to
go
the
princess
with
a
hand
on
her
arm
said
almost
wistfully
staying
on
too
then
do
take
pity
on
us
we
might
go
on
some
trips
together
and
in
the
evenings
we
could
make
a
bridge
a
new
life
began
for
undine
the
princess
chained
her
mother
side
and
frankly
restive
under
her
filial
duty
clung
to
her
new
acquaintance
with
a
persistence
too
flattering
to
be
analyzed
my
dear
i
was
on
the
brink
of
suicide
when
i
saw
your
name
in
the
visitors
list
she
explained
and
undine
felt
like
answering
that
she
had
nearly
reached
the
same
pass
when
the
princess
thin
little
hand
had
been
held
out
to
her
for
the
moment
she
was
dizzy
with
the
effect
of
that
random
gesture
here
she
was
at
the
lowest
ebb
of
her
fortunes
miraculously
rehabilitated
reinstated
and
restored
to
the
old
victorious
sense
of
her
youth
and
her
power
her
sole
graces
her
unaided
personality
had
worked
the
miracle
how
should
she
not
trust
in
them
hereafter
aside
from
her
feeling
of
concrete
attainment
undine
was
deeply
interested
in
her
new
friends
the
princess
and
her
mother
in
their
different
ways
were
different
from
any
one
else
she
had
known
the
princess
who
might
have
been
of
any
age
between
twenty
and
forty
had
a
small
triangular
face
with
caressing
impudent
eyes
a
smile
like
a
silent
whistle
and
the
gait
of
a
baker
boy
balancing
his
basket
she
wore
either
baggy
shabby
clothes
like
a
man
or
rich
draperies
that
looked
as
if
they
had
been
rained
on
and
she
seemed
equally
at
ease
in
either
style
of
dress
and
carelessly
unconscious
of
both
she
was
extremely
familiar
and
unblushingly
inquisitive
but
she
never
gave
undine
the
time
to
ask
her
any
questions
or
the
opportunity
to
venture
on
any
freedom
with
her
nevertheless
she
did
not
scruple
to
talk
of
her
sentimental
experiences
and
seemed
surprised
and
rather
disappointed
that
undine
had
so
few
to
relate
in
return
she
playfully
accused
her
beautiful
new
friend
of
being
cachottiere
and
at
the
sight
of
blush
cried
out
ah
you
funny
americans
why
do
you
all
behave
as
if
love
were
a
secret
infirmity
the
old
duchess
was
even
more
impressive
because
she
fitted
better
into
undine
preconceived
picture
of
the
faubourg
saint
germain
and
was
more
like
the
people
with
whom
she
pictured
the
former
nettie
wincher
as
living
in
privileged
intimacy
the
duchess
was
indeed
more
amiable
and
accessible
than
undine
conception
of
a
duchess
and
displayed
a
curiosity
as
great
as
her
daughter
and
much
more
puerile
concerning
her
new
friend
history
and
habits
but
through
her
mild
prattle
and
in
spite
of
her
limited
perceptions
undine
felt
in
her
the
same
clear
impenetrable
barrier
that
she
ran
against
occasionally
in
the
princess
and
she
was
beginning
to
understand
that
this
barrier
represented
a
number
of
things
about
which
she
herself
had
yet
to
learn
she
would
not
have
known
this
a
few
years
earlier
nor
would
she
have
seen
in
the
duchess
anything
but
the
ruin
of
an
ugly
woman
dressed
in
clothes
that
spragg
would
have
touched
the
duchess
certainly
looked
like
a
ruin
but
undine
now
saw
that
she
looked
like
the
ruin
of
a
castle
the
princess
who
was
unofficially
separated
from
her
husband
had
with
her
her
two
little
girls
she
seemed
extremely
attached
to
both
though
avowing
for
the
younger
a
preference
she
frankly
ascribed
to
the
interesting
accident
of
its
parentage
and
she
could
not
understand
that
undine
as
to
whose
domestic
difficulties
she
minutely
informed
herself
should
have
consented
to
leave
her
child
to
strangers
for
to
one
child
every
one
but
one
self
is
a
stranger
and
whatever
your
egarements
she
began
breaking
off
with
a
stare
when
undine
interrupted
her
to
explain
that
the
courts
had
ascribed
all
the
wrongs
in
the
case
to
her
husband
but
then
but
then
murmured
the
princess
turning
away
from
the
subject
as
if
checked
by
too
deep
an
abyss
of
difference
the
incident
had
embarrassed
undine
and
though
she
tried
to
justify
herself
by
allusions
to
her
boy
dependence
on
his
father
family
and
to
the
duty
of
not
standing
in
his
way
she
saw
that
she
made
no
impression
whatever
one
errors
one
child
belongs
to
one
her
hearer
continued
to
repeat
and
undine
who
was
frequently
scandalized
by
the
princess
conversation
now
found
herself
in
the
odd
position
of
having
to
set
a
watch
upon
her
own
in
order
not
to
scandalize
the
princess
each
day
nevertheless
strengthened
her
hold
on
her
new
friends
after
her
first
flush
of
triumph
she
began
indeed
to
suspect
that
she
had
been
a
slight
disappointment
to
the
princess
had
not
completely
justified
the
hopes
raised
by
the
doubtful
honour
of
being
one
of
sacha
adelschein
intimates
undine
guessed
that
the
princess
had
expected
to
find
her
more
amusing
queerer
more
startling
in
speech
and
conduct
though
by
instinct
she
was
none
of
these
things
she
was
eager
to
go
as
far
as
was
expected
but
she
felt
that
her
audacities
were
on
lines
too
normal
to
be
interesting
and
that
the
princess
thought
her
rather
and
still
they
had
in
common
their
youth
their
boredom
their
high
spirits
and
their
hunger
for
amusement
and
undine
was
making
the
most
of
these
ties
when
one
day
coming
back
from
a
trip
to
with
the
princess
she
was
brought
up
short
by
the
sight
of
a
lady
evidently
a
new
arrival
who
was
seated
in
an
attitude
of
respectful
intimacy
beside
the
old
duchess
chair
undine
advancing
unheard
over
the
fine
gravel
of
the
garden
path
recognized
at
a
glance
the
marquise
de
trezac
drooping
nose
and
disdainful
back
and
at
the
same
moment
heard
her
say
and
her
husband
her
husband
but
she
an
american
she
divorced
the
duchess
replied
as
if
she
were
merely
stating
the
same
fact
in
two
different
ways
and
undine
stopped
short
with
a
pang
of
apprehension
the
princess
came
up
behind
her
who
the
solemn
person
with
mamma
ah
that
old
bore
of
a
trezac
she
dropped
her
long
with
a
laugh
well
she
be
useful
she
stick
to
mamma
like
a
leech
and
we
shall
get
away
oftener
come
let
go
and
be
charming
to
her
she
approached
madame
de
trezac
effusively
and
after
an
interchange
of
exclamations
undine
heard
her
say
you
know
my
friend
marvell
no
how
odd
where
do
you
manage
to
hide
yourself
chere
madame
undine
here
a
compatriot
who
has
the
pleasure
i
such
a
hermit
dear
marvell
the
princess
shows
me
what
i
miss
the
marquise
de
trezac
murmured
rising
to
give
her
hand
to
undine
and
speaking
in
a
voice
so
different
from
that
of
the
supercilious
miss
wincher
that
only
her
facial
angle
and
the
droop
of
her
nose
linked
her
to
the
hated
vision
of
potash
springs
undine
felt
herself
dancing
on
a
of
security
for
the
first
time
the
memory
of
potash
springs
became
a
thing
to
smile
at
and
with
the
princess
arm
through
hers
she
shone
back
triumphantly
on
madame
de
trezac
who
seemed
to
have
grown
suddenly
obsequious
and
insignificant
as
though
the
waving
of
the
princess
wand
had
stripped
her
of
all
her
false
advantages
but
upstairs
in
her
own
room
undine
courage
fell
madame
de
trezac
had
been
civil
effusive
even
because
for
the
moment
she
had
been
taken
off
her
guard
by
finding
marvell
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
the
princess
estradina
and
her
mother
but
the
force
of
facts
would
reassert
itself
far
from
continuing
to
see
undine
through
her
french
eyes
she
would
probably
invite
them
to
view
her
compatriot
through
the
searching
lens
of
her
own
ampler
information
the
old
hypocrite
tell
them
everything
undine
murmured
wincing
at
the
recollection
of
the
dentist
assistant
from
deposit
and
staring
miserably
at
her
reflection
in
the
mirror
of
what
use
were
youth
and
grace
and
good
looks
if
one
drop
of
poison
distilled
from
the
envy
of
a
woman
was
enough
to
paralyze
them
of
course
madame
de
trezac
knew
and
remembered
and
secure
in
her
own
impregnable
position
would
never
rest
till
she
had
driven
out
the
intruder
xxviii
what
do
you
say
to
nice
dearest
the
princess
suggested
a
few
evenings
later
as
she
followed
undine
upstairs
after
a
languid
evening
at
bridge
with
the
duchess
and
madame
de
trezac
down
the
passage
she
stopped
to
open
a
door
and
putting
her
finger
to
her
lip
signed
to
undine
to
enter
in
the
dimness
stood
two
small
white
beds
each
surmounted
by
a
crucifix
and
a
palm
branch
and
each
containing
a
small
brown
sleeping
child
with
a
mop
of
hair
and
a
curiously
finished
little
face
as
the
princess
stood
gazing
on
their
innocent
slumbers
she
seemed
for
a
moment
like
a
third
little
girl
scarcely
bigger
and
browner
than
the
others
and
the
smile
with
which
she
watched
them
was
as
clear
as
theirs
ah
si
seulement
je
pouvais
choisir
leurs
amants
she
sighed
as
she
turned
nice
she
repeated
as
she
and
undine
walked
on
to
their
rooms
with
linked
arms
we
may
as
well
make
hay
while
the
trezac
shines
she
bores
mamma
frightfully
but
mamma
wo
admit
it
because
they
belong
to
the
same
oeuvres
shall
it
be
the
eleven
train
dear
we
can
lunch
at
the
royal
and
look
in
the
shops
we
may
meet
somebody
amusing
anyhow
it
better
than
staying
here
undine
was
sure
the
trip
to
nice
would
be
delightful
their
previous
expeditions
had
shown
her
the
princess
faculty
for
organizing
such
adventures
at
a
few
days
before
they
had
run
across
two
or
three
amusing
but
unassorted
people
and
the
princess
having
fused
them
in
a
jolly
lunch
had
followed
it
up
by
a
bout
at
baccarat
and
finally
hunting
down
an
eminent
composer
who
had
just
arrived
to
rehearse
a
new
production
had
insisted
on
his
asking
the
party
to
tea
and
treating
them
to
fragments
of
his
opera
a
few
days
earlier
undine
hope
of
renewing
such
pleasures
would
have
been
clouded
by
the
dread
of
leaving
madame
de
trezac
alone
with
the
duchess
but
she
had
no
longer
any
fear
of
madame
de
trezac
she
had
discovered
that
her
old
rival
of
potash
springs
was
in
actual
dread
of
her
disfavour
and
nervously
anxious
to
conciliate
her
and
the
discovery
gave
her
such
a
sense
of
the
heights
she
had
scaled
and
the
security
of
her
footing
that
all
her
troubled
past
began
to
seem
like
the
result
of
some
providential
design
and
vague
impulses
of
piety
stirred
in
her
as
she
and
the
princess
whirled
toward
nice
through
the
blue
and
gold
glitter
of
the
morning
they
wandered
about
the
lively
streets
they
gazed
into
the
beguiling
shops
the
princess
tried
on
hats
and
undine
bought
them
and
they
lunched
at
the
royal
on
all
sorts
of
succulent
dishes
prepared
under
the
special
supervision
but
as
they
were
savouring
their
double
coffee
and
liqueurs
and
undine
was
wondering
what
her
companion
would
devise
for
the
afternoon
the
princess
clapped
her
hands
together
and
cried
out
dearest
i
forgotten
i
must
desert
you
she
explained
that
she
promised
the
duchess
to
look
up
a
friend
who
was
ill
a
poor
wretch
who
been
sent
to
cimiez
for
her
lungs
and
that
she
must
rush
off
at
once
and
would
be
back
as
soon
as
possible
well
if
not
in
an
hour
then
in
two
at
latest
she
was
full
of
compunction
but
she
knew
undine
would
forgive
her
and
find
something
amusing
to
fill
up
the
time
she
advised
her
to
go
back
and
buy
the
black
hat
with
the
osprey
and
try
on
the
crepe
de
chine
they
thought
so
smart
for
any
one
as
as
herself
the
woman
would
probably
alter
it
for
nothing
and
they
could
meet
again
at
the
palace
at
four
she
whirled
away
in
a
cloud
of
explanations
and
undine
left
alone
sat
down
on
the
promenade
des
anglais
she
did
not
believe
a
word
the
princess
had
said
she
had
seen
in
a
flash
why
she
was
being
left
and
why
the
plan
had
not
been
divulged
to
her
and
she
quivered
with
resentment
and
humiliation
that
what
she
wanted
me
for
that
why
she
made
up
to
me
she
trying
it
and
after
this
it
happen
regularly
she
drag
me
over
here
every
day
or
two
at
least
she
thinks
she
will
a
sincere
disgust
was
undine
uppermost
sensation
she
was
as
much
ashamed
as
spragg
might
have
been
at
finding
herself
used
to
screen
a
clandestine
adventure
i
let
her
see
i
make
her
understand
she
repeated
angrily
and
for
a
moment
she
was
to
drive
to
the
station
and
take
the
first
train
back
but
the
sense
of
her
precarious
situation
withheld
her
and
presently
with
bitterness
in
her
heart
she
got
up
and
began
to
stroll
toward
the
shops
to
show
that
she
was
not
a
dupe
she
arrived
at
the
designated
nearly
an
hour
later
than
the
time
appointed
but
when
she
entered
the
the
princess
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
the
rooms
were
crowded
and
undine
was
guided
toward
a
small
inner
apartment
where
isolated
couples
were
absorbing
refreshments
in
an
atmosphere
of
intimacy
that
made
it
seem
incongruous
to
be
alone
she
glanced
about
for
a
face
she
knew
but
none
was
visible
and
she
was
just
giving
up
the
search
when
she
beheld
elmer
moffatt
shouldering
his
way
through
the
crowd
the
sight
was
so
surprising
that
she
sat
gazing
with
unconscious
fixity
at
the
round
black
head
and
glossy
reddish
face
which
kept
appearing
and
disappearing
through
the
intervening
jungle
of
aigrettes
it
was
long
since
she
had
either
heard
of
moffatt
or
thought
about
him
and
now
in
her
loneliness
and
exasperation
she
took
comfort
in
the
sight
of
his
confident
capable
face
and
felt
a
longing
to
hear
his
voice
and
unbosom
her
woes
to
him
she
had
half
risen
to
attract
his
attention
when
she
saw
him
turn
back
and
make
way
for
a
companion
who
was
cautiously
steering
her
huge
feathered
hat
between
the
the
woman
was
of
the
vulgarest
type
everything
about
her
was
cheap
and
gaudy
but
moffatt
was
obviously
elated
he
stood
aside
with
a
flourish
to
usher
her
in
and
as
he
followed
he
shot
out
a
pink
with
jewelled
links
and
gave
his
moustache
a
gallant
twist
undine
felt
an
unreasoning
irritation
she
was
vexed
with
him
both
for
not
being
alone
and
for
being
so
vulgarly
accompanied
as
the
couple
seated
themselves
she
caught
moffatt
glance
and
saw
him
redden
to
the
edge
of
his
white
forehead
but
he
elaborately
avoided
her
eye
he
evidently
wanted
her
to
see
him
do
it
and
proceeded
to
minister
to
his
companion
wants
with
an
air
of
experienced
gallantry
the
incident
trifling
as
it
was
filled
up
the
measure
of
bitterness
she
thought
moffatt
pitiably
ridiculous
and
she
hated
him
for
showing
himself
in
such
a
light
at
that
particular
moment
her
mind
turned
back
to
her
own
grievance
and
she
was
just
saying
to
herself
that
nothing
on
earth
should
prevent
her
letting
the
princess
know
what
she
thought
of
her
when
the
lady
in
question
at
last
appeared
she
came
hurriedly
forward
and
behind
her
undine
perceived
the
figure
of
a
slight
quietly
dressed
man
as
to
whom
her
immediate
impression
was
that
he
made
every
one
else
in
the
room
look
as
common
as
moffatt
an
instant
later
the
colour
had
flown
to
her
face
and
her
hand
was
in
raymond
de
chelles
while
the
princess
murmuring
cimiez
such
a
long
way
off
but
you
will
forgive
me
looked
into
her
eyes
with
a
smile
that
added
see
how
i
pay
for
what
i
get
her
first
glance
showed
undine
how
glad
raymond
de
chelles
was
to
see
her
since
their
last
meeting
his
admiration
for
her
seemed
not
only
to
have
increased
but
to
have
acquired
a
different
character
undine
at
an
earlier
stage
in
her
career
might
not
have
known
exactly
what
the
difference
signified
but
it
was
as
clear
to
her
now
as
if
the
princess
had
said
what
her
beaming
eyes
seemed
in
fact
to
convey
i
only
too
glad
to
do
my
cousin
the
same
kind
of
turn
you
doing
me
but
undine
increased
experience
if
it
had
made
her
more
vigilant
had
also
given
her
a
clearer
measure
of
her
power
she
saw
at
once
that
chelles
in
seeking
to
meet
her
again
was
not
in
quest
of
a
mere
passing
adventure
he
was
evidently
deeply
drawn
to
her
and
her
present
situation
if
it
made
it
natural
to
regard
her
as
more
accessible
had
not
altered
the
nature
of
his
feeling
she
saw
and
weighed
all
this
in
the
first
five
minutes
during
which
over
tea
and
muffins
the
princess
descanted
on
her
luck
in
happening
to
run
across
her
cousin
and
chelles
his
enchanted
eyes
on
undine
expressed
his
sense
of
his
good
fortune
he
was
staying
it
appeared
with
friends
at
beaulieu
and
had
run
over
to
nice
that
afternoon
by
the
merest
chance
he
added
that
having
just
learned
of
his
aunt
presence
in
the
neighbourhood
he
had
already
planned
to
present
his
homage
to
her
oh
do
come
to
us
we
too
dull
the
princess
exclaimed
let
us
run
over
occasionally
and
call
on
you
we
dying
for
a
pretext
we
she
added
smiling
at
undine
the
latter
smiled
back
vaguely
and
looked
across
the
room
moffatt
looking
flushed
and
foolish
was
just
pushing
back
his
chair
to
carry
off
his
embarrassment
he
put
an
additional
touch
of
importance
and
as
he
swaggered
out
behind
his
companion
undine
said
to
herself
with
a
shiver
if
he
been
alone
they
would
have
found
me
taking
tea
with
him
undine
during
the
ensuing
weeks
returned
several
times
to
nice
with
the
princess
but
to
the
latter
surprise
she
absolutely
refused
to
have
raymond
de
chelles
included
in
their
or
even
apprised
in
advance
of
their
expeditions
the
princess
always
impatient
of
unnecessary
dissimulation
had
not
attempted
to
keep
up
the
feint
of
the
interesting
invalid
at
cimiez
she
confessed
to
undine
that
she
was
drawn
to
nice
by
the
presence
there
of
the
person
without
whom
for
the
moment
she
found
life
intolerable
and
whom
she
could
not
well
receive
under
the
same
roof
with
her
little
girls
and
her
mother
she
appealed
to
undine
sisterly
heart
to
feel
for
her
in
her
difficulty
and
implied
that
as
her
conduct
had
already
proved
she
would
always
be
ready
to
render
her
friend
a
like
service
it
was
at
this
point
that
undine
checked
her
by
a
decided
word
i
understand
your
position
and
i
very
sorry
for
you
of
course
she
began
the
princess
stared
at
the
sorry
your
secret
perfectly
safe
with
me
and
i
do
anything
i
can
for
you
but
if
i
go
to
nice
with
you
again
you
must
promise
not
to
ask
your
cousin
to
meet
us
the
princess
face
expressed
the
most
genuine
astonishment
oh
my
dear
do
forgive
me
if
i
been
stupid
he
admires
you
so
tremendously
and
i
thought
you
do
as
i
ask
please
wo
you
undine
went
on
ignoring
the
interruption
and
looking
straight
at
her
under
level
brows
and
the
princess
with
a
shrug
merely
murmured
what
a
pity
i
fancied
you
liked
him
xxix
the
early
spring
found
undine
once
more
in
paris
she
had
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
the
result
of
the
course
she
had
pursued
since
she
had
pronounced
her
ultimatum
on
the
subject
of
raymond
de
chelles
she
had
continued
to
remain
on
the
best
of
terms
with
the
princess
to
rise
in
the
estimation
of
the
old
duchess
and
to
measure
the
rapidity
of
her
ascent
in
the
upward
gaze
of
madame
de
trezac
and
she
had
given
chelles
to
understand
that
if
he
wished
to
renew
their
acquaintance
he
must
do
so
in
the
shelter
of
his
venerable
aunt
protection
to
the
princess
she
was
careful
to
make
her
attitude
equally
clear
i
like
your
cousin
very
much
he
delightful
and
if
i
in
paris
this
spring
i
hope
i
shall
see
a
great
deal
of
him
but
i
know
how
easy
it
is
for
a
woman
in
my
position
to
get
talked
about
and
i
have
my
little
boy
to
consider
nevertheless
whenever
chelles
came
over
from
beaulieu
to
spend
a
day
with
his
aunt
and
cousin
an
excursion
he
not
infrequently
repeated
undine
was
at
no
pains
to
conceal
her
pleasure
nor
was
there
anything
calculated
in
her
attitude
chelles
seemed
to
her
more
charming
than
ever
and
the
warmth
of
his
wooing
was
in
flattering
contrast
to
the
cool
reserve
of
his
manners
at
last
she
felt
herself
alive
and
young
again
and
it
became
a
joy
to
look
in
her
glass
and
to
try
on
her
new
hats
and
dresses
the
only
menace
ahead
was
the
usual
one
of
the
want
of
money
while
she
had
travelled
with
her
parents
she
had
been
at
relatively
small
expense
and
since
their
return
to
america
spragg
had
sent
her
allowance
regularly
yet
almost
all
the
money
she
had
received
for
the
pearls
was
already
gone
and
she
knew
her
paris
season
would
be
far
more
expensive
than
the
quiet
weeks
on
the
riviera
meanwhile
the
sense
of
reviving
popularity
and
the
charm
of
devotion
had
almost
effaced
the
ugly
memories
of
failure
and
refurbished
that
image
of
herself
in
other
minds
which
was
her
only
notion
of
under
the
guidance
of
madame
de
trezac
she
had
found
a
prettily
furnished
apartment
in
a
not
too
inaccessible
quarter
and
in
its
light
bright
she
sat
one
june
afternoon
listening
with
all
the
forbearance
of
which
she
was
capable
to
the
counsels
of
her
guide
everything
but
marriage
madame
de
trezac
was
repeating
her
long
head
slightly
tilted
her
features
wearing
the
rapt
look
of
an
adept
reciting
a
hallowed
formula
raymond
de
chelles
had
not
been
mentioned
by
either
of
the
ladies
and
the
former
miss
wincher
was
merely
imparting
to
her
young
friend
one
of
the
fundamental
dogmas
of
her
social
creed
but
undine
was
conscious
that
the
air
between
them
vibrated
with
an
unspoken
name
she
made
no
immediate
answer
but
her
glance
passing
by
madame
de
dull
countenance
sought
her
own
reflection
in
the
mirror
behind
her
visitor
chair
a
beam
of
spring
sunlight
touched
the
living
masses
of
her
hair
and
made
the
face
beneath
as
radiant
as
a
girl
undine
smiled
faintly
at
the
promise
her
own
eyes
gave
her
and
then
turned
them
back
to
her
friend
what
can
such
women
know
about
anything
she
thought
compassionately
there
everything
against
it
madame
de
trezac
continued
in
a
tone
of
patient
exposition
she
seemed
to
be
doing
her
best
to
make
the
matter
clear
in
the
first
place
between
people
in
society
a
religious
marriage
is
necessary
and
since
the
church
does
recognize
divorce
that
obviously
out
of
the
question
in
france
a
man
of
position
who
goes
through
the
form
of
civil
marriage
with
a
divorced
woman
is
simply
ruining
himself
and
her
they
might
much
better
from
her
point
of
view
as
well
as
his
be
as
it
called
over
here
such
arrangements
are
understood
and
allowed
for
but
when
a
frenchman
marries
he
wants
to
marry
as
his
people
always
have
he
knows
there
are
traditions
he
ca
fight
against
and
in
his
heart
he
glad
there
are
oh
i
know
they
so
much
religious
feeling
i
admire
that
in
them
their
religion
so
beautiful
undine
looked
thoughtfully
at
her
visitor
i
suppose
even
money
a
great
deal
of
money
would
make
the
least
bit
of
difference
none
whatever
except
to
make
matters
worse
madame
de
trezac
decisively
rejoined
she
returned
undine
look
with
something
of
miss
wincher
contemptuous
authority
but
she
added
softening
to
a
smile
between
ourselves
i
can
say
it
since
we
neither
of
us
children
a
woman
with
tact
who
not
in
a
position
to
remarry
will
find
society
extremely
indulgent
provided
of
course
she
keeps
up
appearances
undine
turned
to
her
with
the
frown
of
a
startled
diana
we
do
look
at
things
that
way
out
at
apex
she
said
coldly
and
the
blood
rose
in
madame
de
trezac
sallow
cheek
oh
my
dear
it
so
refreshing
to
hear
you
talk
like
that
personally
of
course
i
never
quite
got
used
to
the
french
view
i
hope
no
american
woman
ever
does
said
undine
she
had
been
in
paris
for
about
two
months
when
this
conversation
took
place
and
in
spite
of
her
reviving
she
was
beginning
to
recognize
the
strength
of
the
forces
opposed
to
her
it
had
taken
a
long
time
to
convince
her
that
even
money
could
not
prevail
against
them
and
in
the
intervals
of
expressing
her
admiration
for
the
catholic
creed
she
now
had
violent
reactions
of
militant
protestantism
during
which
she
talked
of
the
tyranny
of
rome
and
recalled
school
stories
of
immoral
popes
and
persecuting
jesuits
meanwhile
her
demeanour
to
chelles
was
that
of
the
incorruptible
but
fearless
american
woman
who
can
not
even
conceive
of
love
outside
of
marriage
but
is
ready
to
give
her
devoted
friendship
to
the
man
on
whom
in
happier
circumstances
she
might
have
bestowed
her
hand
this
attitude
was
provocative
of
many
scenes
during
which
her
unfailing
powers
of
expression
his
gift
of
looking
and
saying
all
the
desperate
and
devoted
things
a
pretty
woman
likes
to
think
she
inspires
gave
undine
the
thrilling
sense
of
breathing
the
very
air
of
french
fiction
but
she
was
aware
that
too
prolonged
tension
of
these
cords
usually
ends
in
their
snapping
and
that
chelles
patience
was
probably
in
inverse
ratio
to
his
ardour
when
madame
de
trezac
had
left
her
these
thoughts
remained
in
her
mind
she
understood
exactly
what
each
of
her
new
friends
wanted
of
her
the
princess
who
was
fond
of
her
cousin
and
had
the
french
sense
of
family
solidarity
would
have
liked
to
see
chelles
happy
in
what
seemed
to
her
the
only
imaginable
way
madame
de
trezac
would
have
liked
to
do
what
she
could
to
second
the
princess
efforts
in
this
or
any
other
line
and
even
the
old
duchess
though
piously
desirous
of
seeing
her
favourite
nephew
married
would
have
thought
it
not
only
natural
but
inevitable
that
while
awaiting
that
happy
event
he
should
try
to
induce
an
amiable
young
woman
to
mitigate
the
drawbacks
of
celibacy
meanwhile
they
might
one
and
all
weary
of
her
if
chelles
did
and
a
persistent
rejection
of
his
suit
would
probably
imperil
her
footing
among
his
friends
all
this
was
clear
to
her
yet
it
did
not
shake
her
resolve
she
was
determined
to
give
up
chelles
unless
he
was
willing
to
marry
her
and
the
thought
of
her
renunciation
moved
her
to
a
kind
of
wistful
melancholy
in
this
mood
her
mind
reverted
to
a
letter
she
had
just
received
from
her
mother
spragg
wrote
more
fully
than
usual
and
the
unwonted
flow
of
her
pen
had
been
occasioned
by
an
event
for
which
she
had
long
yearned
for
months
she
had
pined
for
a
sight
of
her
grandson
had
tried
to
screw
up
her
courage
to
write
and
ask
permission
to
visit
him
and
finally
breaking
through
her
sedentary
habits
had
begun
to
haunt
the
neighbourhood
of
washington
square
with
the
result
that
one
afternoon
she
had
had
the
luck
to
meet
the
little
boy
coming
out
of
the
house
with
his
nurse
she
had
spoken
to
him
and
he
had
remembered
her
and
called
her
granny
and
the
next
day
she
had
received
a
note
from
fairford
saying
that
ralph
would
be
glad
to
send
paul
to
see
her
spragg
enlarged
on
the
delights
of
the
visit
and
the
growing
beauty
and
cleverness
of
her
grandson
she
described
to
undine
exactly
how
paul
was
dressed
how
he
looked
and
what
he
said
and
told
her
how
he
had
examined
everything
in
the
room
and
finally
coming
upon
his
photograph
had
asked
who
the
lady
was
and
on
being
told
had
wanted
to
know
if
she
was
a
very
long
way
off
and
when
granny
thought
she
would
come
back
as
undine
her
mother
pages
she
felt
an
unusual
tightness
in
her
throat
and
two
tears
rose
to
her
eyes
it
was
dreadful
that
her
little
boy
should
be
growing
up
far
away
from
her
perhaps
dressed
in
clothes
she
would
have
hated
and
wicked
and
unnatural
that
when
he
saw
her
picture
he
should
have
to
be
told
who
she
was
if
i
could
only
meet
some
good
man
who
would
give
me
a
home
and
be
a
father
to
him
she
thought
and
the
tears
overflowed
and
ran
down
even
as
they
fell
the
door
was
thrown
open
to
admit
raymond
de
chelles
and
the
consciousness
of
the
moisture
still
glistening
on
her
cheeks
perhaps
strengthened
her
resolve
to
resist
him
and
thus
made
her
more
imperiously
to
be
desired
certain
it
is
that
on
that
day
her
suitor
first
alluded
to
a
possibility
which
madame
de
trezac
had
prudently
refrained
from
suggesting
there
fell
upon
undine
attentive
ears
the
magic
phrase
annulment
of
marriage
her
alert
intelligence
immediately
set
to
work
in
this
new
direction
but
almost
at
the
same
moment
she
became
aware
of
a
subtle
change
of
tone
in
the
princess
and
her
mother
a
change
reflected
in
the
corresponding
decline
of
madame
de
trezac
cordiality
undine
since
her
arrival
in
paris
had
necessarily
been
less
in
the
company
but
when
they
met
she
had
found
her
as
friendly
as
ever
it
was
manifestly
not
a
failing
of
the
princess
to
forget
past
favours
and
though
increasingly
absorbed
by
the
demands
of
town
life
she
treated
her
new
friend
with
the
same
affectionate
frankness
and
undine
was
given
frequent
opportunities
to
enlarge
her
parisian
acquaintance
not
only
in
the
princess
intimate
circle
but
in
the
majestic
of
the
hotel
de
dordogne
now
however
there
was
a
perceptible
decline
in
these
signs
of
hospitality
and
undine
on
calling
one
day
on
the
duchess
noticed
that
her
appearance
sent
a
visible
flutter
of
discomfort
through
the
circle
about
her
hostess
chair
two
or
three
of
the
ladies
present
looked
away
from
the
and
at
each
other
and
several
of
them
seemed
spontaneously
to
encircle
without
approaching
her
while
another
elderly
and
slightly
frightened
with
an
adieu
ma
bonne
tante
to
the
duchess
was
hastily
aided
in
her
retreat
down
the
long
line
of
old
gilded
rooms
the
incident
was
too
mute
and
rapid
to
have
been
noticeable
had
it
not
been
followed
by
the
duchess
resuming
her
conversation
with
the
ladies
nearest
her
as
though
undine
had
just
gone
out
of
the
room
instead
of
entering
it
the
sense
of
having
been
thus
rendered
invisible
filled
undine
with
a
vehement
desire
to
make
herself
seen
and
an
equally
strong
sense
that
all
attempts
to
do
so
would
be
vain
and
when
a
few
minutes
later
she
issued
from
the
portals
of
the
hotel
de
dordogne
it
was
with
the
fixed
resolve
not
to
enter
them
again
till
she
had
had
an
explanation
with
the
princess
she
was
spared
the
trouble
of
seeking
one
by
the
arrival
early
the
next
morning
of
madame
de
trezac
who
entering
almost
with
the
breakfast
tray
mysteriously
asked
to
be
allowed
to
communicate
something
of
importance
you
understand
i
know
the
princess
not
coming
herself
madame
de
trezac
began
sitting
up
very
straight
on
the
edge
of
the
over
which
undine
lace
hung
if
there
anything
she
wants
to
say
to
me
i
do
undine
answered
leaning
back
among
her
rosy
pillows
and
reflecting
compassionately
that
the
face
opposite
her
was
just
the
colour
of
the
café
au
lait
she
was
pouring
out
there
are
things
that
are
that
might
seem
too
pointed
if
one
said
them
one
self
madame
de
trezac
continued
our
dear
so
she
so
hates
to
do
anything
unfriendly
but
she
naturally
thinks
first
of
her
mother
her
mother
what
the
matter
with
her
mother
i
told
her
i
knew
you
did
understand
i
was
sure
you
take
it
in
good
part
undine
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
what
did
lili
tell
you
to
tell
me
oh
not
to
tell
you
simply
to
ask
if
just
for
the
present
mind
avoiding
the
duchess
thursdays
calling
on
any
other
day
that
is
any
other
day
she
not
at
home
on
any
other
do
you
mean
she
want
me
to
call
well
not
while
the
marquise
de
chelles
is
in
paris
she
the
duchess
favourite
niece
and
of
course
they
all
hang
together
that
kind
of
family
feeling
is
something
you
naturally
do
undine
had
a
sudden
glimpse
of
hidden
intricacies
that
was
raymond
de
chelles
mother
i
saw
there
yesterday
the
one
they
hurried
out
when
i
came
in
it
seems
she
was
very
much
upset
she
somehow
heard
your
name
why
should
she
have
heard
my
name
and
why
in
the
world
should
it
upset
her
madame
de
trezac
heaved
a
hesitating
sigh
is
it
better
to
be
frank
she
thinks
she
has
reason
to
feel
badly
they
all
do
to
feel
badly
because
her
son
wants
to
marry
me
of
course
they
know
that
impossible
madame
de
trezac
smiled
compassionately
but
they
afraid
of
your
spoiling
his
other
chances
undine
paused
a
moment
before
answering
it
wo
be
impossible
when
my
marriage
is
annulled
she
said
the
effect
of
this
statement
was
less
electrifying
than
she
had
hoped
her
visitor
simply
broke
into
a
laugh
my
dear
child
your
marriage
annulled
who
can
have
put
such
a
mad
idea
into
your
head
undine
gaze
followed
the
pattern
she
was
tracing
with
a
lustrous
nail
on
her
embroidered
bedspread
raymond
himself
she
let
fall
this
time
there
was
no
mistaking
the
effect
she
produced
madame
de
trezac
with
a
murmured
oh
sat
gazing
before
her
as
if
she
had
lost
the
thread
of
her
argument
and
it
was
only
after
a
considerable
interval
that
she
recovered
it
sufficiently
to
exclaim
they
never
hear
of
it
absolutely
never
but
they
ca
prevent
it
can
they
they
can
prevent
its
being
of
any
use
to
you
i
see
undine
pensively
assented
she
knew
the
tone
she
had
taken
was
virtually
a
declaration
of
war
but
she
was
in
a
mood
when
the
act
of
defiance
apart
from
its
strategic
value
was
a
satisfaction
in
itself
moreover
if
she
could
not
gain
her
end
without
a
fight
it
was
better
that
the
battle
should
be
engaged
while
raymond
ardour
was
at
its
height
to
provoke
immediate
hostilities
she
sent
for
him
the
same
afternoon
and
related
quietly
and
without
comment
the
incident
of
her
visit
to
the
duchess
and
the
mission
with
which
madame
de
trezac
had
been
charged
in
the
circumstances
she
went
on
to
explain
it
was
manifestly
impossible
that
she
should
continue
to
receive
his
visits
and
she
met
his
wrathful
comments
on
his
relatives
by
the
gently
but
firmly
expressed
resolve
not
to
be
the
cause
of
any
disagreement
between
himself
and
his
family
xxx
a
few
days
after
her
decisive
conversation
with
raymond
de
chelles
undine
emerging
from
the
doors
of
the
nouveau
luxe
where
she
had
been
to
call
on
the
homer
branney
once
more
found
herself
face
to
face
with
elmer
moffatt
this
time
there
was
no
mistaking
his
eagerness
to
be
recognized
he
stopped
short
as
they
met
and
she
read
such
pleasure
in
his
eyes
that
she
too
stopped
holding
out
her
hand
i
glad
you
going
to
speak
to
me
she
said
and
moffatt
reddened
at
the
allusion
well
i
very
nearly
did
i
did
know
you
you
look
about
as
old
as
you
did
when
i
first
landed
at
apex
remember
he
turned
back
and
began
to
walk
at
her
side
in
the
direction
of
the
champs
elysees
say
this
is
all
right
he
exclaimed
and
she
saw
that
his
glance
had
left
her
and
was
ranging
across
the
wide
silvery
square
ahead
of
them
to
the
congregated
domes
and
spires
beyond
the
river
do
you
like
paris
she
asked
wondering
what
theatres
he
had
been
to
it
beats
everything
he
seemed
to
be
breathing
in
deeply
the
impression
of
fountains
sculpture
leafy
avenues
and
architectural
distances
fading
into
the
afternoon
haze
i
suppose
you
been
to
that
old
church
over
there
he
went
on
his
stick
pointing
toward
the
towers
of
notre
dame
oh
of
course
when
i
used
to
sightsee
have
you
never
been
to
paris
before
no
this
is
my
first
i
came
across
in
march
in
march
she
echoed
inattentively
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
other
people
lives
went
on
when
they
were
out
of
her
range
of
vision
and
she
tried
in
vain
to
remember
what
she
had
last
heard
of
moffatt
was
that
a
bad
time
to
leave
wall
street
well
fact
is
i
was
played
out
needed
a
change
nothing
in
his
robust
mien
confirmed
the
statement
and
he
did
not
seem
inclined
to
develop
it
i
presume
you
settled
here
now
he
went
on
i
saw
by
the
papers
yes
she
interrupted
adding
after
a
moment
it
was
all
a
mistake
from
the
first
well
i
never
thought
he
was
your
form
said
moffatt
his
eyes
had
come
back
to
her
and
the
look
in
them
struck
her
as
something
she
might
use
to
her
advantage
but
the
next
moment
he
had
glanced
away
with
a
furrowed
brow
and
she
felt
she
had
not
wholly
fixed
his
attention
i
live
at
the
other
end
of
paris
why
not
come
back
and
have
tea
with
me
she
suggested
half
moved
by
a
desire
to
know
more
of
his
affairs
and
half
by
the
thought
that
a
talk
with
him
might
help
to
shed
some
light
on
hers
in
the
open
he
seemed
to
recover
his
sense
of
and
leaned
back
his
hands
on
the
knob
of
his
stick
with
the
air
of
a
man
pleasantly
aware
of
his
privileges
this
paris
is
a
thundering
good
place
he
repeated
once
or
twice
as
they
rolled
on
through
the
crush
and
glitter
of
the
afternoon
and
when
they
had
descended
at
door
and
he
stood
in
her
and
looked
out
on
the
trees
rounding
their
green
domes
under
the
balcony
his
satisfaction
culminated
in
the
comment
i
guess
this
lays
out
west
end
avenue
his
eyes
met
undine
with
their
old
twinkle
and
their
expression
encouraged
her
to
murmur
of
course
there
are
times
when
i
very
lonely
she
sat
down
behind
the
and
he
stood
at
a
little
distance
watching
her
pull
off
her
gloves
with
a
queer
comic
twitch
of
his
elastic
mouth
well
i
guess
it
only
when
you
want
to
be
he
said
grasping
a
chair
by
its
gilt
cords
and
sitting
down
astride
of
it
his
light
grey
trousers
stretching
too
tightly
over
his
plump
thighs
undine
was
perfectly
aware
that
he
was
a
vulgar
man
with
a
red
crease
of
fat
above
his
collar
and
an
impudent
swaggering
eye
yet
she
liked
to
see
him
there
and
was
conscious
that
he
stirred
the
fibres
of
a
self
she
had
forgotten
but
had
not
ceased
to
understand
she
had
fancied
her
avowal
of
loneliness
might
call
forth
some
sentimental
phrase
but
though
moffatt
was
clearly
pleased
to
be
with
her
she
saw
that
she
was
not
the
centre
of
his
thoughts
and
the
discovery
irritated
her
i
do
suppose
you
known
what
it
is
to
be
lonely
since
you
been
in
europe
she
continued
as
she
held
out
his
oh
he
said
jocosely
i
do
always
go
round
with
a
guide
and
she
rejoined
on
the
same
note
then
perhaps
i
shall
see
something
of
you
why
there
nothing
would
suit
me
better
but
the
fact
is
probably
sailing
next
week
oh
are
you
i
sorry
there
was
nothing
feigned
in
her
regret
anything
i
can
do
for
you
across
the
pond
she
hesitated
there
something
you
can
do
for
me
right
off
he
looked
at
her
more
attentively
as
if
his
practised
eve
had
passed
through
the
surface
of
her
beauty
to
what
might
be
going
on
behind
it
do
you
want
my
blessing
again
he
asked
with
sudden
irony
undine
opened
her
eyes
with
a
trustful
look
yes
i
do
well
i
be
damned
said
moffatt
gaily
you
always
been
so
awfully
nice
she
began
and
he
leaned
back
grasping
both
sides
of
the
and
shaking
it
a
little
with
his
laugh
he
kept
the
same
attitude
while
she
proceeded
to
unfold
her
case
listening
to
her
with
the
air
of
sober
concentration
that
his
frivolous
face
took
on
at
any
serious
demand
on
his
attention
when
she
had
ended
he
kept
the
same
look
during
an
interval
of
silent
pondering
is
it
the
fellow
who
was
over
at
nice
with
you
that
day
she
looked
at
him
with
surprise
how
did
you
know
why
i
liked
his
looks
said
moffatt
simply
he
got
up
and
strolled
toward
the
window
on
the
way
he
stopped
before
a
table
covered
with
showy
trifles
and
after
looking
at
them
for
a
moment
singled
out
a
dim
old
brown
and
golden
book
which
chelles
had
given
her
he
examined
it
lingeringly
as
though
it
touched
the
spring
of
some
sensibility
for
which
he
had
no
language
say
he
began
it
was
the
usual
prelude
to
his
enthusiasms
but
he
laid
the
book
down
and
turned
back
then
you
think
if
you
had
the
cash
you
could
fix
it
up
all
right
with
the
pope
her
heart
began
to
beat
she
remembered
that
he
had
once
put
a
job
in
ralph
way
and
had
let
her
understand
that
he
had
done
it
partly
for
her
sake
well
he
continued
relapsing
into
hyperbole
i
wish
i
could
send
the
old
gentleman
my
cheque
morning
but
the
fact
is
i
high
and
dry
he
looked
at
her
with
a
sudden
odd
intensity
if
i
was
i
dunno
but
what
the
phrase
was
lost
in
his
familiar
whistle
that
an
awfully
fetching
way
you
do
your
hair
he
said
it
was
a
disappointment
to
undine
to
hear
that
his
affairs
were
not
prospering
for
she
knew
that
in
his
world
pull
and
solvency
were
closely
related
and
that
such
support
as
she
had
hoped
he
might
give
her
would
be
contingent
on
his
own
situation
but
she
had
again
a
fleeting
sense
of
his
mysterious
power
of
accomplishing
things
in
the
teeth
of
adversity
and
she
answered
what
i
want
is
your
advice
he
turned
away
and
wandered
across
the
room
his
hands
in
his
pockets
on
her
ornate
writing
desk
he
saw
a
photograph
of
paul
and
in
a
manly
reefer
and
bent
over
it
with
a
murmur
of
approval
say
what
a
fellow
got
him
with
you
undine
coloured
no
she
began
and
seeing
his
look
of
surprise
she
embarked
on
her
usual
explanation
i
ca
tell
you
how
i
miss
him
she
ended
with
a
ring
of
truth
that
carried
conviction
to
her
own
ears
if
not
to
moffatt
why
do
you
get
him
back
then
why
i
moffatt
had
picked
up
the
frame
and
was
looking
at
the
photograph
more
closely
pants
he
chuckled
i
declare
he
turned
back
to
undine
who
does
he
belong
to
anyhow
belong
to
who
got
him
when
you
were
divorced
did
you
oh
i
got
everything
she
said
her
instinct
of
on
the
alert
so
i
thought
he
stood
before
her
stoutly
planted
on
his
short
legs
and
speaking
with
an
aggressive
energy
well
i
know
what
i
do
if
he
was
mine
if
he
was
yours
and
you
tried
to
get
him
away
from
me
fight
you
to
a
finish
if
it
cost
me
down
to
my
last
dollar
i
would
the
conversation
seemed
to
be
wandering
from
the
point
and
she
answered
with
a
touch
of
impatience
it
would
cost
you
anything
like
that
i
have
got
a
dollar
to
fight
back
with
well
you
ai
got
to
fight
your
decree
gave
him
to
you
did
it
why
do
you
send
right
over
and
get
him
that
what
i
do
if
i
was
you
undine
looked
up
but
i
awfully
poor
i
ca
afford
to
have
him
here
you
could
up
to
now
but
now
you
going
to
get
married
going
to
be
able
to
give
him
a
home
and
a
father
care
and
the
foreign
languages
that
what
i
say
if
i
was
you
his
father
takes
considerable
stock
in
him
do
he
she
coloured
a
denial
on
her
lips
but
she
could
not
shape
it
both
awfully
fond
of
him
of
course
his
father
never
give
him
up
just
so
moffatt
face
had
grown
as
sharp
as
glass
you
got
the
marvells
running
all
you
got
to
do
to
sit
tight
and
wait
for
their
cheque
he
dropped
back
to
his
equestrian
seat
on
the
chair
undine
stood
up
and
moved
uneasily
toward
the
window
she
seemed
to
see
her
little
boy
as
though
he
were
in
the
room
with
her
she
did
not
understand
how
she
could
have
lived
so
long
without
him
she
stood
for
a
long
time
without
speaking
feeling
behind
her
the
concentrated
irony
of
moffatt
gaze
you
could
lend
me
the
money
manage
to
borrow
it
for
me
i
mean
she
finally
turned
back
to
ask
he
laughed
if
i
could
manage
to
borrow
any
money
at
this
particular
minute
well
i
have
to
lend
every
dollar
of
it
to
elmer
moffatt
esquire
i
if
you
want
to
know
and
wanted
for
an
investigation
too
that
why
i
over
here
improving
my
mind
why
i
thought
you
were
going
home
next
week
he
grinned
i
am
because
i
found
out
there
a
party
wants
me
to
stay
away
worse
than
the
courts
want
me
back
making
the
trip
just
for
my
private
satisfaction
there
wo
be
any
money
in
it
i
afraid
leaden
disappointment
descended
on
undine
she
had
felt
almost
sure
of
moffatt
helping
her
and
for
an
instant
she
wondered
if
some
jealousy
had
flamed
up
under
its
cold
cinders
but
another
look
at
his
face
denied
her
this
solace
and
his
evident
indifference
was
the
last
blow
to
her
pride
the
twinge
it
gave
her
prompted
her
to
ask
do
you
ever
mean
to
get
married
moffatt
gave
her
a
quick
look
why
i
should
wonder
one
of
these
days
millionaires
always
collect
something
but
i
got
to
collect
my
millions
first
he
spoke
coolly
and
and
before
he
had
ended
she
had
lost
all
interest
in
his
reply
he
seemed
aware
of
the
fact
for
he
stood
up
and
held
out
his
hand
well
so
long
marvell
it
been
uncommonly
pleasant
to
see
you
and
you
better
think
over
what
said
she
laid
her
hand
sadly
in
his
you
never
had
a
child
she
replied
xxxi
nearly
two
years
had
passed
since
ralph
marvell
waking
from
his
long
sleep
in
the
hot
summer
light
of
washington
square
had
found
that
the
face
of
life
was
changed
for
him
in
the
interval
he
had
gradually
adapted
himself
to
the
new
order
of
things
but
the
months
of
adaptation
had
been
a
time
of
such
darkness
and
confusion
that
from
the
of
his
recovered
lucidity
he
could
not
yet
distinguish
the
stages
by
which
he
had
worked
his
way
out
and
even
now
his
footing
was
not
secure
his
first
effort
had
been
to
readjust
his
values
to
take
an
inventory
of
them
and
reclassify
them
so
that
one
at
least
might
be
made
to
appear
as
important
as
those
he
had
lost
otherwise
there
could
be
no
reason
why
he
should
go
on
living
he
applied
himself
doggedly
to
this
attempt
but
whenever
he
thought
he
had
found
a
reason
that
his
mind
could
rest
in
it
gave
way
under
him
and
the
old
struggle
for
a
foothold
began
again
his
two
objects
in
life
were
his
boy
and
his
book
the
boy
was
incomparably
the
stronger
argument
yet
the
less
serviceable
in
filling
the
void
ralph
felt
his
son
all
the
while
and
all
through
his
other
feelings
but
he
could
not
think
about
him
actively
and
continuously
could
not
forever
exercise
his
eager
empty
dissatisfied
mind
on
the
relatively
simple
problem
of
clothing
educating
and
amusing
a
little
boy
of
six
yet
paul
existence
was
the
reason
for
his
own
and
he
turned
again
with
a
kind
of
cold
fervour
to
his
abandoned
literary
dream
material
needs
obliged
him
to
go
on
with
his
regular
business
but
the
day
work
over
he
was
possessed
of
a
leisure
as
bare
and
as
blank
as
an
unfurnished
house
yet
that
was
at
least
his
own
to
furnish
as
he
pleased
meanwhile
he
was
beginning
to
show
a
presentable
face
to
the
world
and
to
be
once
more
treated
like
a
man
in
whose
case
no
one
is
particularly
interested
his
men
friends
ceased
to
say
hallo
old
chap
i
never
saw
you
looking
fitter
and
elderly
ladies
no
longer
told
him
they
were
sure
he
kept
too
much
to
himself
and
urged
him
to
drop
in
any
afternoon
for
a
quiet
talk
people
left
him
to
his
sorrow
as
a
man
is
left
to
an
incurable
habit
an
unfortunate
tie
they
ignored
it
or
looked
over
its
head
if
they
happened
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
it
at
his
elbow
these
glimpses
were
given
to
them
more
and
more
rarely
the
smothered
springs
of
life
were
bubbling
up
in
ralph
and
there
were
days
when
he
was
glad
to
wake
and
see
the
sun
in
his
window
and
when
he
began
to
plan
his
book
and
to
fancy
that
the
planning
really
interested
him
he
could
even
maintain
the
delusion
for
several
days
for
intervals
each
time
appreciably
longer
before
it
shrivelled
up
again
in
a
scorching
blast
of
disenchantment
the
worst
of
it
was
that
he
could
never
tell
when
these
hot
gusts
of
anguish
would
overtake
him
they
came
sometimes
just
when
he
felt
most
secure
when
he
was
saying
to
himself
after
all
things
are
really
worth
while
sometimes
even
when
he
was
sitting
with
clare
van
degen
listening
to
her
voice
watching
her
hands
and
turning
over
in
his
mind
the
opening
chapters
of
his
book
you
ought
to
write
they
had
one
and
all
said
it
to
him
from
the
first
and
he
fancied
he
might
have
begun
sooner
if
he
had
not
been
urged
on
by
their
watchful
fondness
everybody
wanted
him
to
write
everybody
had
decided
that
he
ought
to
that
he
would
that
he
must
be
persuaded
to
and
the
incessant
imperceptible
pressure
of
encouragement
the
assumption
of
those
about
him
that
because
it
would
be
good
for
him
to
write
he
must
naturally
be
able
to
acted
on
his
restive
nerves
as
a
stronger
deterrent
than
disapproval
even
clare
had
fallen
into
the
same
mistake
and
one
day
as
he
sat
talking
with
her
on
the
verandah
of
laura
fairford
house
on
the
sound
where
they
now
most
frequently
met
ralph
had
rejoined
oh
if
you
think
it
literature
i
need
instantly
he
had
seen
her
face
change
and
the
speaking
hands
tremble
on
her
knee
but
she
achieved
the
feat
of
not
answering
him
or
turning
her
steady
eyes
from
the
dancing
water
at
the
foot
of
lawn
ralph
leaned
a
little
nearer
and
for
an
instant
his
hand
imagined
the
flutter
of
hers
but
instead
of
clasping
it
he
drew
back
and
rising
from
his
chair
wandered
away
to
the
other
end
of
the
verandah
no
he
did
feel
as
clare
felt
if
he
loved
her
as
he
sometimes
thought
he
did
it
was
not
in
the
same
way
he
had
a
great
tenderness
for
her
he
was
more
nearly
happy
with
her
than
with
any
one
else
he
liked
to
sit
and
talk
with
her
and
watch
her
face
and
her
hands
and
he
wished
there
were
some
way
some
different
way
of
letting
her
know
it
but
he
could
not
conceive
that
tenderness
and
desire
could
ever
again
be
one
for
him
such
a
notion
as
that
seemed
part
of
the
monstrous
sentimental
muddle
on
which
his
life
had
gone
aground
i
shall
write
of
course
i
shall
write
some
day
he
said
turning
back
to
his
seat
i
had
a
novel
in
the
back
of
my
head
for
years
and
now
the
time
to
pull
it
out
he
hardly
knew
what
he
was
saying
but
before
the
end
of
the
sentence
he
saw
that
clare
had
understood
what
he
meant
to
convey
and
henceforth
he
felt
committed
to
letting
her
talk
to
him
as
much
as
she
pleased
about
his
book
he
himself
in
consequence
took
to
thinking
about
it
more
consecutively
and
just
as
his
friends
ceased
to
urge
him
to
write
he
sat
down
in
earnest
to
begin
the
vision
that
had
come
to
him
had
no
likeness
to
any
of
his
earlier
imaginings
two
or
three
subjects
had
haunted
him
pleading
for
expression
during
the
first
years
of
his
marriage
but
these
now
seemed
either
too
lyrical
or
too
tragic
he
no
longer
saw
life
on
the
heroic
scale
he
wanted
to
do
something
in
which
men
should
look
no
bigger
than
the
insects
they
were
he
contrived
in
the
course
of
time
to
reduce
one
of
his
old
subjects
to
these
dimensions
and
after
nights
of
brooding
he
made
a
dash
at
it
and
wrote
an
opening
chapter
that
struck
him
as
not
too
bad
in
the
exhilaration
of
this
first
attempt
he
spent
some
pleasant
evenings
revising
and
polishing
his
work
and
gradually
a
feeling
of
authority
and
importance
developed
in
him
in
the
morning
when
he
woke
instead
of
his
habitual
sense
of
lassitude
he
felt
an
eagerness
to
be
up
and
doing
and
a
conviction
that
his
individual
task
was
a
necessary
part
of
the
world
machinery
he
kept
his
secret
with
the
beginner
deadly
fear
of
losing
his
hold
on
his
creations
if
he
let
in
any
outer
light
on
them
but
he
went
about
with
a
more
assured
step
shrank
less
from
meeting
his
friends
and
even
began
to
dine
out
again
and
to
laugh
at
some
of
the
jokes
he
heard
laura
fairford
to
get
paul
away
from
town
had
gone
early
to
the
country
and
ralph
who
went
down
to
her
every
saturday
usually
found
clare
van
degen
there
since
his
divorce
he
had
never
entered
his
cousin
pinnacled
palace
and
clare
had
never
asked
him
why
he
stayed
away
this
mutual
silence
had
been
their
sole
allusion
to
van
share
in
the
catastrophe
though
ralph
had
spoken
frankly
of
its
other
aspects
they
talked
however
most
often
of
impersonal
subjects
books
pictures
plays
or
whatever
the
world
that
interested
them
was
doing
and
she
showed
no
desire
to
draw
him
back
to
his
own
affairs
she
was
again
staying
late
in
town
to
have
a
pretext
as
he
guessed
for
coming
down
on
sundays
to
the
fairfords
and
they
often
made
the
trip
together
in
her
motor
but
he
had
not
yet
spoken
to
her
of
having
begun
his
book
one
may
evening
however
as
they
sat
alone
in
the
verandah
he
suddenly
told
her
that
he
was
writing
as
he
spoke
his
heart
beat
like
a
boy
but
once
the
words
were
out
they
gave
him
a
feeling
of
and
he
began
to
sketch
his
plan
and
then
to
go
into
its
details
clare
listened
devoutly
her
eyes
burning
on
him
through
the
dusk
like
the
stars
deepening
above
the
garden
and
when
she
got
up
to
go
in
he
followed
her
with
a
new
sense
of
reassurance
the
dinner
that
evening
was
unusually
pleasant
charles
bowen
just
back
from
his
usual
spring
travels
had
come
straight
down
to
his
friends
from
the
steamer
and
the
fund
of
impressions
he
brought
with
him
gave
ralph
a
desire
to
be
up
and
wandering
and
why
not
when
the
book
was
done
he
smiled
across
the
table
at
clare
next
summer
you
have
to
charter
a
yacht
and
take
us
all
off
to
the
aegean
we
ca
have
charles
condescending
to
us
about
the
places
he
been
seeing
was
it
really
he
who
was
speaking
and
his
cousin
who
was
sending
him
back
her
dusky
smile
well
why
not
again
the
seasons
renewed
themselves
and
he
too
was
putting
out
a
new
growth
my
book
my
book
my
book
kept
repeating
itself
under
all
his
thoughts
as
undine
name
had
once
perpetually
murmured
there
that
night
as
he
went
up
to
bed
he
said
to
himself
that
he
was
actually
ceasing
to
think
about
his
wife
as
he
passed
laura
door
she
called
him
in
and
put
her
arms
about
him
you
look
so
well
dear
but
why
should
i
he
answered
gaily
as
if
ridiculing
the
fancy
that
he
had
ever
looked
otherwise
paul
was
sleeping
behind
the
next
door
and
the
sense
of
the
boy
nearness
gave
him
a
warmer
glow
his
little
world
was
rounding
itself
out
again
and
once
more
he
felt
safe
and
at
peace
in
its
circle
his
sister
looked
as
if
she
had
something
more
to
say
but
she
merely
kissed
him
good
night
and
he
went
up
whistling
to
his
room
the
next
morning
he
was
to
take
a
walk
with
clare
and
while
he
lounged
about
the
waiting
for
her
to
come
down
a
servant
came
in
with
the
sunday
papers
ralph
picked
one
up
and
was
absently
unfolding
it
when
his
eye
fell
on
his
own
name
a
sight
he
had
been
spared
since
the
last
echoes
of
his
divorce
had
subsided
his
impulse
was
to
fling
the
paper
down
to
hurl
it
as
far
from
him
as
he
could
but
a
grim
fascination
tightened
his
hold
and
drew
his
eyes
back
to
the
hated
new
york
beauty
weds
french
nobleman
undine
marvell
confident
pope
will
annul
previous
marriage
marvell
talks
about
her
case
there
it
was
before
him
in
all
its
horror
an
interview
an
interview
of
undine
about
her
coming
marriage
ah
she
talked
about
her
case
indeed
her
confidences
filled
the
greater
part
of
a
column
and
the
only
detail
she
seemed
to
have
omitted
was
the
name
of
her
future
husband
who
was
referred
to
by
herself
as
my
fiancé
and
by
the
interviewer
as
the
count
or
a
prominent
scion
of
the
french
nobility
ralph
heard
laura
step
behind
him
he
threw
the
paper
aside
and
their
eyes
met
is
this
what
you
wanted
to
tell
me
last
night
last
night
is
it
in
the
papers
who
told
you
bowen
what
else
has
he
heard
oh
ralph
what
does
it
matter
what
can
it
matter
who
the
man
did
he
tell
you
that
ralph
insisted
he
saw
her
growing
agitation
why
ca
you
answer
is
it
any
one
i
know
he
was
told
in
paris
it
was
his
friend
raymond
de
chelles
ralph
laughed
and
his
laugh
sounded
in
his
own
ears
like
an
echo
of
the
dreary
mirth
with
which
he
had
filled
spragg
office
the
day
he
had
learned
that
undine
intended
to
divorce
him
but
now
his
wrath
was
seasoned
with
a
wholesome
irony
the
fact
of
his
wife
having
reached
another
stage
in
her
ascent
fell
into
its
place
as
a
part
of
the
huge
human
buffoonery
besides
laura
went
on
it
all
perfect
nonsense
of
course
how
in
the
world
can
she
have
her
marriage
annulled
ralph
pondered
this
put
the
matter
in
another
light
with
a
great
deal
of
money
i
suppose
she
might
well
she
certainly
wo
get
that
from
chelles
he
far
from
rich
charles
tells
me
laura
waited
watching
him
before
she
risked
that
what
convinces
me
she
would
have
him
if
she
could
ralph
shrugged
there
may
be
other
inducements
but
she
wo
be
able
to
manage
it
he
heard
himself
speaking
quite
collectedly
had
undine
at
last
lost
her
power
of
wounding
him
clare
came
in
dressed
for
their
walk
and
under
laura
anxious
eyes
he
picked
up
the
newspaper
and
held
it
out
with
a
careless
look
at
this
his
cousin
glance
flew
down
the
column
and
he
saw
the
tremor
of
her
lashes
as
she
read
then
she
lifted
her
head
but
you
be
free
her
face
was
as
vivid
as
a
flower
free
i
free
now
as
far
as
that
goes
oh
but
it
will
go
so
much
farther
when
she
has
another
name
when
she
a
different
person
altogether
then
you
really
have
paul
to
yourself
paul
laura
intervened
with
a
nervous
laugh
but
there
never
been
the
least
doubt
about
his
having
paul
they
heard
the
boy
laughter
on
the
lawn
and
she
went
out
to
join
him
ralph
was
still
looking
at
his
cousin
you
glad
then
came
from
him
involuntarily
and
she
startled
him
by
bursting
into
tears
he
bent
over
and
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
xxxii
ralph
as
the
days
passed
felt
that
clare
was
right
if
undine
married
again
he
would
possess
himself
more
completely
be
more
definitely
rid
of
his
past
and
he
did
not
doubt
that
she
would
gain
her
end
he
knew
her
violent
desires
and
her
cold
tenacity
if
she
had
failed
to
capture
van
degen
it
was
probably
because
she
lacked
experience
of
that
particular
type
of
man
of
his
huge
immediate
wants
and
feeble
vacillating
purposes
most
of
all
because
she
had
not
yet
measured
the
strength
of
the
social
considerations
that
restrained
him
it
was
a
mistake
she
was
not
likely
to
repeat
and
her
failure
had
probably
been
a
useful
preliminary
to
success
it
was
a
long
time
since
ralph
had
allowed
himself
to
think
of
her
and
as
he
did
so
the
overwhelming
fact
of
her
beauty
became
present
to
him
again
no
longer
as
an
element
of
his
being
but
as
a
power
dispassionately
estimated
he
said
to
himself
any
man
who
can
feel
at
all
will
feel
it
as
i
did
and
the
conviction
grew
in
him
that
raymond
de
chelles
of
whom
he
had
formed
an
idea
through
bowen
talk
was
not
the
man
to
give
her
up
even
if
she
failed
to
obtain
the
release
his
religion
exacted
meanwhile
ralph
was
gradually
beginning
to
feel
himself
freer
and
lighter
undine
act
by
cutting
the
last
link
between
them
seemed
to
have
given
him
back
to
himself
and
the
mere
fact
that
he
could
consider
his
case
in
all
its
bearings
impartially
and
ironically
showed
him
the
distance
he
had
travelled
the
extent
to
which
he
had
renewed
himself
he
had
been
moved
too
by
clare
cry
of
joy
at
his
release
though
the
nature
of
his
feeling
for
her
had
not
changed
he
was
aware
of
a
new
quality
in
their
friendship
when
he
went
back
to
his
book
again
his
sense
of
power
had
lost
its
asperity
and
the
spectacle
of
life
seemed
less
like
a
witless
dangling
of
limp
dolls
he
was
well
on
in
his
second
chapter
now
this
lightness
of
mood
was
still
on
him
when
returning
one
afternoon
to
washington
square
full
of
projects
for
a
long
evening
work
he
found
his
mother
awaiting
him
with
a
strange
face
he
followed
her
into
the
and
she
explained
that
there
had
been
a
telephone
message
she
did
understand
something
perfectly
crazy
about
paul
of
course
it
was
all
a
mistake
ralph
first
thought
was
of
an
accident
and
his
heart
contracted
did
laura
telephone
no
no
not
laura
it
seemed
to
be
a
message
from
spragg
something
about
sending
some
one
here
to
fetch
him
a
queer
name
like
heeny
to
fetch
him
to
a
steamer
on
saturday
i
was
to
be
sure
to
have
his
things
packed
but
of
course
it
a
misunderstanding
she
gave
an
uncertain
laugh
and
looked
up
at
ralph
as
though
entreating
him
to
return
the
reassurance
she
had
given
him
of
course
of
course
he
echoed
he
made
his
mother
repeat
her
statement
but
the
unforeseen
always
flurried
her
and
she
was
confused
and
inaccurate
she
did
actually
know
who
had
telephoned
the
voice
had
sounded
like
spragg
a
woman
voice
yes
oh
not
a
lady
and
there
was
certainly
something
about
a
steamer
but
he
knew
how
the
telephone
bewildered
her
and
she
was
sure
she
was
getting
a
little
deaf
had
he
better
call
up
the
malibran
of
course
it
was
all
a
mistake
but
well
perhaps
he
had
better
go
there
himself
as
he
reached
the
front
door
a
letter
clinked
in
the
box
and
he
saw
his
name
on
an
ordinary
looking
business
envelope
he
turned
the
paused
again
and
stooped
to
take
out
the
letter
it
bore
the
address
of
the
firm
of
lawyers
who
had
represented
undine
in
the
divorce
proceedings
and
as
he
tore
open
the
envelope
paul
name
started
out
at
him
marvell
had
followed
him
into
the
hall
and
her
cry
broke
the
silence
ralph
ralph
is
it
anything
she
done
nothing
it
nothing
he
stared
at
her
what
the
day
of
the
week
wednesday
why
what
she
suddenly
seemed
to
understand
she
not
going
to
take
him
away
from
us
ralph
dropped
into
a
chair
crumpling
the
letter
in
his
hand
he
had
been
in
a
dream
poor
fool
that
he
was
a
dream
about
his
child
he
sat
gazing
at
the
phrases
that
spun
themselves
out
before
him
my
client
circumstances
now
happily
permitting
at
last
in
a
position
to
offer
her
son
a
home
long
separation
a
feelings
every
social
and
educational
advantage
and
then
at
the
end
the
poisoned
dart
that
struck
him
speechless
the
courts
having
awarded
her
the
sole
custody
the
sole
custody
but
that
meant
that
paul
was
hers
hers
only
hers
for
always
that
his
father
had
no
more
claim
on
him
than
any
casual
stranger
in
the
street
and
he
ralph
marvell
a
sane
man
young
in
full
possession
of
his
wits
had
assisted
at
the
perpetration
of
this
abominable
wrong
had
passively
forfeited
his
right
to
the
flesh
of
his
body
the
blood
of
his
being
but
it
could
be
of
course
it
could
be
the
preposterousness
of
it
proved
that
it
true
there
was
a
mistake
somewhere
a
mistake
his
own
lawyer
would
instantly
rectify
if
a
hammer
had
been
drumming
in
his
head
he
could
have
recalled
the
terms
of
the
decree
but
for
the
moment
all
the
details
of
the
agonizing
episode
were
lost
in
a
blur
of
uncertainty
to
escape
his
mother
silent
anguish
of
interrogation
he
stood
up
and
said
i
see
spragg
of
course
it
a
mistake
but
as
he
spoke
he
retravelled
the
hateful
months
during
the
divorce
proceedings
remembering
his
incomprehensible
lassitude
his
acquiescence
in
his
family
determination
to
ignore
the
whole
episode
and
his
gradual
lapse
into
the
same
state
of
apathy
he
recalled
all
the
old
family
catchwords
the
full
and
elaborate
vocabulary
of
evasion
delicacy
pride
personal
dignity
preferring
not
to
know
about
such
things
marvell
all
i
ask
is
that
you
wo
mention
the
subject
to
your
grandfather
dagonet
spare
your
mother
ralph
whatever
happens
and
even
laura
terrified
of
course
for
paul
sake
there
must
be
no
scandal
for
paul
sake
and
it
was
because
for
paul
sake
there
must
be
no
scandal
that
he
paul
father
had
tamely
abstained
from
defending
his
rights
and
contesting
his
wife
charges
and
had
thus
handed
the
child
over
to
her
keeping
as
his
cab
whirled
him
up
fifth
avenue
ralph
whole
body
throbbed
with
rage
against
the
influences
that
had
reduced
him
to
such
weakness
then
gradually
he
saw
that
the
weakness
was
innate
in
him
he
had
been
eloquent
enough
in
his
free
youth
against
the
conventions
of
his
class
yet
when
the
moment
came
to
show
his
contempt
for
them
they
had
mysteriously
mastered
him
deflecting
his
course
like
some
hidden
hereditary
failing
as
he
looked
back
it
seemed
as
though
even
his
great
disaster
had
been
conventionalized
and
sentimentalized
by
this
inherited
attitude
that
the
thoughts
he
had
thought
about
it
were
only
those
of
generations
of
dagonets
and
that
there
had
been
nothing
real
and
his
own
in
his
life
but
the
foolish
passion
he
had
been
trying
so
hard
to
think
out
of
existence
halfway
to
the
malibran
he
changed
his
direction
and
drove
to
the
house
of
the
lawyer
he
had
consulted
at
the
time
of
his
divorce
the
lawyer
had
not
yet
come
up
town
and
ralph
had
a
half
hour
of
bitter
meditation
before
the
sound
of
a
brought
him
to
his
feet
the
visit
did
not
last
long
his
host
after
an
affable
greeting
listened
without
surprise
to
what
he
had
to
say
and
when
he
had
ended
reminded
him
with
somewhat
ironic
precision
that
at
the
time
of
the
divorce
he
had
asked
for
neither
advice
nor
information
had
simply
declared
that
he
wanted
to
turn
his
back
on
the
whole
business
ralph
recognized
the
phrase
as
one
of
his
grandfather
and
on
hearing
that
in
that
case
he
had
only
to
abstain
from
action
and
was
in
no
need
of
legal
services
had
gone
away
without
farther
enquiries
you
led
me
to
infer
you
had
your
reasons
the
slighted
counsellor
concluded
and
in
reply
to
ralph
breathless
question
he
subjoined
why
you
see
the
case
is
closed
and
i
do
exactly
know
on
what
ground
you
can
it
unless
of
course
you
can
bring
evidence
showing
that
the
irregularity
of
the
mother
life
is
such
she
going
to
marry
again
ralph
threw
in
indeed
well
that
in
itself
can
hardly
be
described
as
irregular
in
fact
in
certain
circumstances
it
might
be
construed
as
an
advantage
to
the
child
then
i
powerless
why
unless
there
an
ulterior
motive
through
which
pressure
might
be
brought
to
bear
you
mean
that
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
find
out
what
she
up
to
precisely
of
course
if
it
should
prove
to
be
a
genuine
case
of
maternal
feeling
i
wo
conceal
from
you
that
the
outlook
bad
at
most
you
could
probably
arrange
to
see
your
boy
at
stated
intervals
to
see
his
boy
at
stated
intervals
ralph
wondered
how
a
sane
man
could
sit
there
looking
responsible
and
efficient
and
talk
such
rubbish
as
he
got
up
to
go
the
lawyer
detained
him
to
add
of
course
there
no
immediate
cause
for
alarm
it
will
take
time
to
enforce
the
provision
of
the
dakota
decree
in
new
york
and
till
it
done
your
son
be
taken
from
you
but
there
sure
to
be
a
lot
of
nasty
talk
in
the
papers
and
you
bound
to
lose
in
the
end
ralph
thanked
him
and
left
he
sped
northward
to
the
malibran
where
he
learned
that
and
spragg
were
at
dinner
he
sent
his
name
down
to
the
subterranean
restaurant
and
spragg
presently
appeared
between
the
limp
portieres
of
the
adam
he
had
grown
older
and
heavier
as
if
illness
instead
of
health
had
put
more
flesh
on
his
bones
and
there
were
greyish
tints
in
the
hollows
of
his
face
what
this
about
paul
ralph
exclaimed
my
mother
had
a
message
we
ca
make
out
spragg
sat
down
with
the
effect
of
immersing
his
spinal
column
in
the
depths
of
the
he
selected
he
crossed
his
legs
and
swung
one
foot
to
and
fro
in
its
high
wrinkled
boot
with
elastic
sides
did
you
get
a
letter
he
asked
from
my
from
undine
lawyers
yes
ralph
held
it
out
it
queer
reading
she
has
hitherto
been
very
keen
to
have
paul
with
her
spragg
adjusting
his
glasses
read
the
letter
slowly
restored
it
to
the
envelope
and
gave
it
back
my
daughter
has
intimated
that
she
wishes
these
gentlemen
to
act
for
her
i
have
received
any
additional
instructions
from
her
he
said
with
none
of
the
curtness
of
tone
that
his
stiff
legal
vocabulary
implied
but
the
first
communication
i
received
was
from
you
at
least
from
mrs
spragg
spragg
drew
his
beard
through
his
hand
the
ladies
are
apt
to
be
a
trifle
hasty
i
believe
spragg
had
a
letter
yesterday
instructing
her
to
select
a
reliable
escort
for
paul
and
i
suppose
she
thought
oh
this
is
all
too
preposterous
ralph
burst
out
springing
from
his
seat
you
do
for
a
moment
imagine
do
you
any
of
you
that
i
going
to
deliver
up
my
son
like
a
bale
of
goods
in
answer
to
any
instructions
in
god
world
oh
yes
i
know
i
let
him
go
i
abandoned
my
right
to
him
but
i
did
know
what
i
was
doing
i
was
sick
with
grief
and
misery
my
people
were
awfully
broken
up
over
the
whole
business
and
i
wanted
to
spare
them
i
wanted
above
all
to
spare
my
boy
when
he
grew
up
if
i
contested
the
case
you
know
what
the
result
would
have
been
i
let
it
go
by
default
i
made
no
conditions
all
i
wanted
was
to
keep
paul
and
never
to
let
him
hear
a
word
against
his
mother
spragg
received
this
passionate
appeal
in
a
silence
that
implied
not
so
much
disdain
or
indifference
as
the
total
inability
to
deal
verbally
with
emotional
crises
at
length
he
said
a
slight
unsteadiness
in
his
usually
calm
tones
i
presume
at
the
time
it
was
optional
with
you
to
demand
paul
custody
oh
yes
it
was
optional
ralph
sneered
spragg
looked
at
him
compassionately
i
sorry
you
did
do
it
he
said
xxxiii
the
upshot
of
ralph
visit
was
that
spragg
after
considerable
deliberation
agreed
pending
farther
negotiations
between
the
opposing
lawyers
to
undertake
that
no
attempt
should
be
made
to
remove
paul
from
his
father
custody
nevertheless
he
seemed
to
think
it
quite
natural
that
undine
on
the
point
of
making
a
marriage
which
would
put
it
in
her
power
to
give
her
child
a
suitable
home
should
assert
her
claim
on
him
it
was
more
disconcerting
to
ralph
to
learn
that
spragg
for
once
departing
from
her
attitude
of
passive
impartiality
had
eagerly
abetted
her
daughter
move
he
had
somehow
felt
that
undine
desertion
of
the
child
had
established
a
kind
of
mute
understanding
between
himself
and
his
i
thought
spragg
would
know
there
no
earthly
use
trying
to
take
paul
from
me
he
said
with
a
desperate
awkwardness
of
entreaty
and
spragg
startled
him
by
replying
i
presume
his
grandma
thinks
belong
to
her
more
if
we
keep
him
in
the
family
ralph
abruptly
awakened
from
his
dream
of
recovered
peace
found
himself
confronted
on
every
side
by
indifference
or
hostility
it
was
as
though
the
june
fields
in
which
his
boy
was
playing
had
suddenly
opened
to
engulph
him
marvell
fears
and
tremors
were
almost
harder
to
bear
than
the
spraggs
antagonism
and
for
the
next
few
days
ralph
wandered
about
miserably
dreading
some
fresh
communication
from
undine
lawyers
yet
racked
by
the
strain
of
hearing
nothing
more
from
them
spragg
had
agreed
to
cable
his
daughter
asking
her
to
await
a
letter
before
enforcing
her
demands
but
on
the
fourth
day
after
ralph
visit
to
the
malibran
a
telephone
message
summoned
him
to
his
office
half
an
hour
later
their
talk
was
over
and
he
stood
once
more
on
the
landing
outside
spragg
door
undine
answer
had
come
and
fate
was
sealed
his
mother
refused
to
give
him
up
refused
to
await
the
arrival
of
her
lawyer
letter
and
reiterated
in
more
peremptory
language
her
demand
that
the
child
should
be
sent
immediately
to
paris
in
heeny
care
spragg
in
face
of
ralph
entreaties
remained
pacific
but
remote
it
was
evident
that
though
he
had
no
wish
to
quarrel
with
ralph
he
saw
no
reason
for
resisting
undine
i
guess
she
got
the
law
on
her
side
he
said
and
in
response
to
ralph
passionate
remonstrances
he
added
fatalistically
i
presume
you
have
to
leave
the
matter
to
my
daughter
ralph
had
gone
to
the
office
resolved
to
control
his
temper
and
keep
on
the
watch
for
any
shred
of
information
he
might
glean
but
it
soon
became
clear
that
spragg
knew
as
little
as
himself
of
projects
or
of
the
stage
her
plans
had
reached
all
she
had
apparently
vouchsafed
her
parent
was
the
statement
that
she
intended
to
and
the
command
to
send
paul
over
and
ralph
reflected
that
his
own
betrothal
to
her
had
probably
been
announced
to
spragg
in
the
same
curt
fashion
the
thought
brought
back
an
overwhelming
sense
of
the
past
one
by
one
the
details
of
that
incredible
moment
revived
and
he
felt
in
his
veins
the
glow
of
rapture
with
which
he
had
first
approached
the
dingy
threshold
he
was
now
leaving
there
came
back
to
him
with
peculiar
vividness
the
memory
of
his
rushing
up
to
spragg
office
to
consult
him
about
a
necklace
for
undine
ralph
recalled
the
incident
because
his
eager
appeal
for
advice
had
been
received
by
spragg
with
the
very
phrase
he
had
just
used
i
presume
you
have
to
leave
the
matter
to
my
daughter
ralph
saw
him
slouching
in
his
chair
swung
sideways
from
the
untidy
desk
his
legs
stretched
out
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
jaws
engaged
on
the
phantom
and
in
a
corner
of
the
office
the
figure
of
a
young
man
who
seemed
to
have
been
interrupted
in
the
act
of
saying
something
disagreeable
why
it
must
have
been
then
that
i
first
saw
moffatt
ralph
reflected
and
the
thought
suggested
the
memory
of
other
subsequent
meetings
in
the
same
building
and
of
frequent
ascents
to
moffatt
office
during
the
ardent
weeks
of
their
mysterious
and
remunerative
deal
ralph
wondered
if
moffatt
office
were
still
in
the
ararat
and
on
the
way
out
he
paused
before
the
black
tablet
affixed
to
the
wall
of
the
vestibule
and
sought
and
found
the
name
in
its
familiar
place
the
next
moment
he
was
again
absorbed
in
his
own
cares
now
that
he
had
learned
the
imminence
of
paul
danger
and
the
futility
of
pleading
for
delay
a
thousand
fantastic
projects
were
contending
in
his
head
to
get
the
boy
away
that
seemed
the
first
thing
to
do
to
put
him
out
of
reach
and
then
invoke
the
law
get
the
case
and
carry
the
fight
from
court
to
court
till
his
rights
should
be
recognized
it
would
cost
a
lot
of
money
well
the
money
would
have
to
be
found
the
first
step
was
to
secure
the
boy
temporary
safety
after
that
the
question
of
ways
and
means
would
have
to
be
considered
had
there
ever
been
a
time
ralph
wondered
when
that
question
had
been
at
the
root
of
all
the
others
he
had
promised
to
let
clare
van
degen
know
the
result
of
his
visit
and
half
an
hour
later
he
was
in
her
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
entered
it
since
his
divorce
but
van
degen
was
in
california
and
besides
he
had
to
see
clare
his
one
relief
was
in
talking
to
her
in
feverishly
turning
over
with
her
every
possibility
of
delay
and
obstruction
and
he
marvelled
at
the
intelligence
and
energy
she
brought
to
the
discussion
of
these
questions
it
was
as
if
she
had
never
before
felt
strongly
enough
about
anything
to
put
her
heart
or
her
brains
into
it
but
now
everything
in
her
was
at
work
for
him
she
listened
intently
to
what
he
told
her
then
she
said
you
tell
me
it
will
cost
a
great
deal
but
why
take
it
to
the
courts
at
all
why
not
give
the
money
to
undine
instead
of
to
your
lawyers
ralph
looked
at
her
in
surprise
and
she
continued
why
do
you
suppose
she
suddenly
made
up
her
mind
she
must
have
paul
that
comprehensible
enough
to
any
one
who
knows
her
she
wants
him
because
he
give
her
the
appearance
of
respectability
having
him
with
her
will
prove
as
no
mere
assertions
can
that
all
the
rights
are
on
her
side
and
the
on
mine
clare
considered
yes
that
the
obvious
answer
but
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
think
my
dear
you
and
i
are
both
completely
i
do
believe
undine
cares
a
straw
for
appearance
of
respectability
what
she
wants
is
the
money
for
her
annulment
ralph
uttered
an
incredulous
exclamation
but
do
you
see
she
hurried
on
it
her
only
hope
her
last
chance
she
much
too
clever
to
burden
herself
with
the
child
merely
to
annoy
you
what
she
wants
is
to
make
you
buy
him
back
from
her
she
stood
up
and
came
to
him
with
outstretched
hands
perhaps
i
can
be
of
use
to
you
at
last
you
he
summoned
up
a
haggard
smile
as
if
you
always
letting
me
load
you
with
all
my
bothers
oh
if
only
i
hit
on
the
way
out
of
this
one
then
there
be
any
others
left
her
eyes
followed
him
intently
as
he
turned
away
to
the
window
and
stood
staring
down
at
the
sultry
prospect
of
fifth
avenue
as
he
turned
over
her
conjecture
its
probability
became
more
and
more
apparent
it
put
into
logical
relation
all
the
incoherencies
of
undine
recent
conduct
completed
and
defined
her
anew
as
if
a
sharp
line
had
been
drawn
about
her
fading
image
if
it
that
i
shall
soon
know
he
said
turning
back
into
the
room
his
course
had
instantly
become
plain
he
had
only
to
resist
and
undine
would
have
to
show
her
hand
simultaneously
with
this
thought
there
sprang
up
in
his
mind
the
remembrance
of
the
autumn
afternoon
in
paris
when
he
had
come
home
and
found
her
among
her
finery
desperately
bewailing
her
coming
motherhood
clare
touch
was
on
his
arm
if
i
right
you
will
let
me
help
he
laid
his
hand
on
hers
without
speaking
and
she
went
on
it
will
take
a
lot
of
money
all
these
do
besides
she
be
ashamed
to
sell
him
cheap
you
must
be
ready
to
give
her
anything
she
wants
and
i
got
a
lot
saved
up
money
of
my
own
i
mean
your
own
as
he
looked
at
her
the
rare
blush
rose
under
her
brown
skin
my
very
own
why
should
you
believe
me
i
been
hoarding
up
my
scrap
of
an
income
for
years
thinking
that
some
day
i
find
i
stand
this
any
longer
her
gesture
embraced
their
sumptuous
setting
but
now
i
know
i
shall
never
budge
there
are
the
children
and
besides
things
are
easier
for
me
since
she
paused
embarrassed
yes
yes
i
know
he
felt
like
completing
her
phrase
since
my
wife
has
furnished
you
with
the
means
of
putting
pressure
on
your
husband
but
he
simply
repeated
i
know
and
you
will
let
me
help
oh
we
must
get
at
the
facts
first
he
caught
her
hands
in
his
with
sudden
energy
as
you
say
when
paul
safe
there
wo
be
another
bother
left
xxxiv
the
means
of
raising
the
requisite
amount
of
money
became
during
the
next
few
weeks
the
anxious
theme
of
all
ralph
thoughts
his
enquiries
soon
brought
the
confirmation
of
clare
surmise
and
it
became
clear
that
for
reasons
swathed
in
all
the
ingenuities
of
legal
verbiage
undine
might
in
return
for
a
substantial
consideration
be
prevailed
on
to
admit
that
it
was
for
her
son
advantage
to
remain
with
his
father
the
day
this
admission
was
communicated
to
ralph
his
first
impulse
was
to
carry
the
news
to
his
cousin
his
mood
was
one
of
pure
exaltation
he
seemed
to
be
hugging
his
boy
to
him
as
he
walked
paul
and
he
were
to
belong
to
each
other
forever
no
mysterious
threat
of
separation
could
ever
menace
them
again
he
had
the
blissful
sense
of
relief
that
the
child
himself
might
have
had
on
waking
out
of
a
frightened
dream
and
finding
the
jolly
daylight
in
his
room
clare
at
once
renewed
her
entreaty
to
be
allowed
to
aid
in
ransoming
her
little
cousin
but
ralph
tried
to
put
her
off
by
explaining
that
he
meant
to
look
about
look
where
in
the
dagonet
coffers
oh
ralph
what
the
use
of
pretending
tell
me
what
you
got
to
give
her
it
was
amazing
how
his
cousin
suddenly
dominated
him
but
as
yet
he
could
go
into
the
details
of
the
bargain
that
the
reckoning
between
himself
and
undine
should
be
settled
in
dollars
and
cents
seemed
the
last
bitterest
satire
on
his
dreams
he
felt
himself
miserably
diminished
by
the
smallness
of
what
had
filled
his
world
nevertheless
the
looking
about
had
to
be
done
and
a
day
came
when
he
found
himself
once
more
at
the
door
of
elmer
moffatt
office
his
thoughts
had
been
drawn
back
to
moffatt
by
the
insistence
with
which
the
latter
name
had
lately
been
put
forward
by
the
press
in
connection
with
a
revival
of
the
ararat
investigation
moffatt
it
appeared
had
been
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
valuable
witnesses
for
the
state
his
return
from
europe
had
been
anxiously
awaited
his
unreadiness
to
testify
caustically
criticized
then
at
last
he
had
arrived
had
gone
on
to
washington
and
had
apparently
had
nothing
to
tell
ralph
was
too
deep
in
his
own
troubles
to
waste
any
wonder
over
this
anticlimax
but
the
frequent
appearance
of
moffatt
name
in
the
morning
papers
acted
as
an
unconscious
suggestion
besides
to
whom
else
could
he
look
for
help
the
sum
his
wife
demanded
could
be
acquired
only
by
a
quick
turn
and
the
fact
that
ralph
had
once
rendered
the
same
kind
of
service
to
moffatt
made
it
natural
to
appeal
to
him
now
the
market
moreover
happened
to
be
booming
and
it
seemed
not
unlikely
that
so
experienced
a
speculator
might
have
a
good
thing
up
his
sleeve
moffatt
office
had
been
transformed
since
ralph
last
visit
paint
varnish
and
brass
railings
gave
an
air
of
opulence
to
the
outer
precincts
and
the
inner
room
with
its
mahogany
bookcases
containing
sets
and
its
wide
blue
leather
lacked
only
a
palm
or
two
to
resemble
the
lounge
of
a
fashionable
hotel
moffatt
himself
as
he
came
forward
gave
ralph
the
impression
of
having
been
done
over
by
the
same
hand
he
was
smoother
broader
more
supremely
tailored
and
his
whole
person
exhaled
the
faintest
whiff
of
an
expensive
scent
he
installed
his
visitor
in
one
of
the
blue
and
sitting
opposite
an
elbow
on
his
impressive
washington
desk
listened
attentively
while
ralph
made
his
request
you
want
to
be
put
onto
something
good
in
a
damned
hurry
moffatt
twisted
his
moustache
between
two
plump
fingers
with
a
little
black
growth
on
their
lower
joints
i
do
suppose
he
remarked
there
a
sane
man
between
here
and
san
francisco
who
consumed
by
that
yearning
having
permitted
himself
this
pleasantry
he
passed
on
to
business
yes
it
a
time
to
buy
no
doubt
of
that
but
you
say
you
want
to
make
a
quick
heard
of
a
soft
thing
that
wo
wait
i
presume
that
apt
to
be
the
way
with
soft
things
all
kinds
of
there
always
other
fellows
after
them
moffatt
smile
was
playful
well
i
go
considerably
out
of
my
way
to
do
you
a
good
turn
because
you
did
me
one
when
i
needed
it
mighty
bad
youth
you
sheltered
me
yes
sir
that
the
kind
i
am
he
stood
up
sauntered
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
took
a
small
object
from
the
top
of
the
bookcase
fond
of
these
pink
crystals
he
held
the
oriental
toy
against
the
light
oh
i
ai
a
judge
but
now
and
then
i
like
to
pick
up
a
pretty
thing
ralph
noticed
that
his
eyes
caressed
it
well
now
let
talk
you
say
you
got
to
have
the
funds
for
your
your
investment
within
three
weeks
that
quick
work
and
you
want
a
hundred
thousand
can
you
put
up
fifty
ralph
had
been
prepared
for
the
question
but
when
it
came
he
felt
a
moment
tremor
he
knew
he
could
count
on
half
the
amount
from
his
grandfather
could
possibly
ask
fairford
for
a
small
additional
loan
but
what
of
the
rest
well
there
was
clare
he
had
always
known
there
would
be
no
other
way
and
after
all
the
money
was
clare
it
was
dagonet
money
at
least
she
said
it
was
all
the
misery
of
his
predicament
was
distilled
into
the
short
silence
that
preceded
his
answer
yes
i
think
so
well
i
guess
i
can
double
it
for
you
moffatt
spoke
with
an
air
of
olympian
modesty
anyhow
i
try
only
do
tell
the
other
girls
he
proceeded
to
develop
his
plan
to
ears
which
ralph
tried
to
make
alert
and
attentive
but
in
which
perpetually
through
the
intricate
concert
of
facts
and
figures
there
broke
the
shout
of
a
small
boy
racing
across
a
suburban
lawn
when
i
pick
him
up
he
be
mine
for
good
ralph
thought
as
moffatt
summed
up
there
the
whole
scheme
in
a
but
you
better
think
it
over
i
do
want
to
let
you
in
for
anything
you
ai
quite
sure
about
oh
if
you
sure
ralph
was
already
calculating
the
time
it
would
take
to
dash
up
to
clare
van
degen
on
his
way
to
catch
the
train
for
the
fairfords
his
impatience
made
it
hard
to
pay
due
regard
to
moffatt
parting
civilities
glad
to
have
seen
you
he
heard
the
latter
assuring
him
with
a
final
wish
you
dine
with
me
some
evening
at
my
club
and
as
ralph
murmured
a
vague
acceptance
how
that
boy
of
yours
by
the
way
moffatt
continued
he
was
a
stunning
chap
last
time
i
saw
excuse
me
if
i
put
my
foot
in
it
but
i
understood
you
kept
him
with
you
yes
that
what
i
thought
well
so
long
clare
inner
was
empty
but
the
servant
presently
returning
led
ralph
into
the
gilded
and
tapestried
wilderness
where
she
occasionally
chose
to
receive
her
visitors
there
under
popple
effigy
of
herself
she
sat
small
and
alone
on
a
monumental
sofa
behind
a
laden
with
gold
plate
while
from
his
lofty
frame
on
the
opposite
wall
van
degen
portrayed
by
a
powerful
artist
cast
on
her
the
satisfied
eye
of
proprietorship
ralph
swept
forward
on
the
blast
of
his
excitement
felt
as
in
a
dream
the
frivolous
perversity
of
her
receiving
him
in
such
a
setting
instead
of
in
their
usual
quiet
corner
but
there
was
no
room
in
his
mind
for
anything
but
the
cry
that
broke
from
him
i
believe
i
done
it
he
sat
down
and
explained
to
her
by
what
means
trying
as
best
he
could
to
restate
the
particulars
of
moffatt
deal
and
her
manifest
ignorance
of
business
methods
had
the
effect
of
making
his
vagueness
appear
less
vague
anyhow
he
seems
to
be
sure
it
a
safe
thing
i
understand
he
in
with
rolliver
now
and
rolliver
practically
controls
apex
this
is
some
kind
of
a
scheme
to
buy
up
all
the
works
of
public
utility
at
apex
they
practically
sure
of
their
charter
and
moffatt
tells
me
i
can
count
on
doubling
my
investment
within
a
few
weeks
of
course
i
go
into
the
details
if
you
like
oh
no
you
made
it
all
so
clear
to
me
she
really
made
him
feel
he
had
and
besides
what
on
earth
does
it
matter
the
great
thing
is
that
it
done
she
lifted
her
sparkling
eyes
and
now
my
share
you
have
told
me
he
explained
that
dagonet
to
whom
he
had
already
named
the
amount
demanded
had
at
once
promised
him
thousand
dollars
to
be
eventually
deducted
from
his
share
of
the
estate
his
mother
had
something
put
by
that
she
insisted
on
contributing
and
henley
fairford
of
his
own
accord
had
come
forward
with
ten
thousand
it
was
awfully
decent
of
henley
even
henley
clare
sighed
then
i
the
only
one
left
out
ralph
felt
the
colour
in
his
face
well
you
see
i
shall
need
as
much
as
fifty
her
hands
flew
together
joyfully
but
then
you
got
to
let
me
help
oh
i
so
glad
so
glad
i
twenty
thousand
waiting
he
looked
about
the
room
checked
anew
by
all
its
oppressive
implications
you
a
darling
but
i
could
take
it
i
told
you
it
mine
every
penny
of
it
yes
but
supposing
things
went
wrong
nothing
can
if
you
only
take
it
i
may
lose
it
if
i
given
it
to
you
her
look
followed
his
about
the
room
and
then
came
back
to
him
ca
you
imagine
all
it
will
make
up
for
the
rapture
of
the
cry
caught
him
up
with
it
ah
yes
he
could
imagine
it
all
he
stooped
his
head
above
her
hands
i
accept
he
said
and
they
stood
and
looked
at
each
other
like
radiant
children
she
followed
him
to
the
door
and
as
he
turned
to
leave
he
broke
into
a
laugh
it
queer
though
its
happening
in
this
room
she
was
close
beside
him
her
hand
on
the
heavy
tapestry
curtaining
the
door
and
her
glance
shot
past
him
to
her
husband
portrait
ralph
caught
the
look
and
a
flood
of
old
tendernesses
and
hates
welled
up
in
him
he
drew
her
under
the
portrait
and
kissed
her
vehemently
xxxv
within
hours
ralph
money
was
in
moffatt
hands
and
the
interval
of
suspense
had
begun
the
transaction
over
he
felt
the
deceptive
buoyancy
that
follows
on
periods
of
painful
indecision
it
seemed
to
him
that
now
at
last
life
had
freed
him
from
all
trammelling
delusions
leaving
him
only
the
best
thing
in
its
gift
his
boy
the
things
he
meant
paul
to
do
and
to
be
filled
his
fancy
with
happy
pictures
the
child
was
growing
more
and
more
interesting
throwing
out
countless
tendrils
of
feeling
and
perception
that
delighted
ralph
but
preoccupied
the
watchful
laura
he
going
to
be
exactly
like
you
ralph
she
paused
and
then
risked
it
for
his
own
sake
i
wish
there
were
just
a
drop
or
two
of
spragg
in
him
ralph
laughed
understanding
her
oh
the
plodding
citizen
i
become
will
keep
him
from
taking
after
the
lyric
idiot
who
begot
him
paul
and
i
between
us
are
going
to
turn
out
something
his
book
too
was
spreading
and
throwing
out
tendrils
and
he
worked
at
it
in
the
white
heat
of
energy
which
his
factitious
exhilaration
produced
for
a
few
weeks
everything
he
did
and
said
seemed
as
easy
and
unconditioned
as
the
actions
in
a
dream
clare
van
degen
in
the
light
of
this
mood
became
again
the
comrade
of
his
boyhood
he
did
not
see
her
often
for
she
had
gone
down
to
the
country
with
her
children
but
they
communicated
daily
by
letter
or
telephone
and
now
and
then
she
came
over
to
the
fairfords
for
a
night
there
they
renewed
the
long
rambles
of
their
youth
and
once
more
the
summer
fields
and
woods
seemed
full
of
magic
presences
clare
was
no
more
intelligent
she
followed
him
no
farther
in
his
flights
but
some
of
the
qualities
that
had
become
most
precious
to
him
were
as
native
to
her
as
its
perfume
to
a
flower
so
through
the
long
june
afternoons
they
ranged
together
over
many
themes
and
if
her
answers
sometimes
missed
the
mark
it
did
not
matter
because
her
silences
never
did
meanwhile
ralph
from
various
sources
continued
to
pick
up
a
good
deal
of
more
or
less
contradictory
information
about
elmer
moffatt
it
seemed
to
be
generally
understood
that
moffatt
had
come
back
from
europe
with
the
intention
of
testifying
in
the
ararat
investigation
and
that
his
former
patron
the
great
harmon
driscoll
had
managed
to
silence
him
and
it
was
implied
that
the
price
of
this
silence
which
was
set
at
a
considerable
figure
had
been
turned
to
account
in
a
series
of
speculations
likely
to
lift
moffatt
to
permanent
eminence
among
the
rulers
of
wall
street
the
stories
as
to
his
latest
achievement
and
the
theories
as
to
the
man
himself
varied
with
the
visual
angle
of
each
reporter
and
whenever
any
attempt
was
made
to
focus
his
hard
sharp
personality
some
guardian
divinity
seemed
to
throw
a
veil
of
mystery
over
him
his
detractors
however
were
the
first
to
own
that
there
was
something
about
him
it
was
felt
that
he
had
passed
beyond
the
meteoric
stage
and
the
business
world
was
unanimous
in
recognizing
that
he
had
come
to
stay
a
dawning
sense
of
his
stability
was
even
beginning
to
make
itself
felt
in
fifth
avenue
it
was
said
that
he
had
bought
a
house
in
street
then
that
he
meant
to
build
near
the
park
one
or
two
people
always
taken
by
a
friend
had
been
to
his
flat
in
the
pactolus
to
see
his
chinese
porcelains
and
persian
rugs
now
and
then
he
had
a
few
important
men
to
dine
at
a
fifth
avenue
restaurant
his
name
began
to
appear
in
philanthropic
reports
and
on
municipal
committees
there
were
even
rumours
of
its
having
been
put
up
at
a
club
and
the
rector
of
a
wealthy
parish
who
was
raising
funds
for
a
chantry
was
known
to
have
met
him
at
dinner
and
to
have
stated
afterward
that
the
man
was
not
wholly
a
materialist
all
these
converging
proofs
of
moffatt
solidity
strengthened
faith
in
his
venture
he
remembered
with
what
astuteness
and
authority
moffatt
had
conducted
their
real
estate
transaction
how
far
off
and
unreal
it
all
seemed
and
awaited
events
with
the
passive
faith
of
a
sufferer
in
the
hands
of
a
skilful
surgeon
the
days
moved
on
toward
the
end
of
june
and
each
morning
ralph
opened
his
newspaper
with
a
keener
thrill
of
expectation
any
day
now
he
might
read
of
the
granting
of
the
apex
charter
moffatt
had
assured
him
it
would
go
through
before
the
close
of
the
month
but
the
announcement
did
not
appear
and
after
what
seemed
to
ralph
a
decent
lapse
of
time
he
telephoned
to
ask
for
news
moffatt
was
away
and
when
he
came
back
a
few
days
later
he
answered
ralph
enquiries
evasively
with
an
edge
of
irritation
in
his
voice
the
same
day
ralph
received
a
letter
from
his
lawyer
who
had
been
reminded
by
marvell
representatives
that
the
latest
date
agreed
on
for
the
execution
of
the
financial
agreement
was
the
end
of
the
following
week
ralph
alarmed
betook
himself
at
once
to
the
ararat
and
his
first
glimpse
of
moffatt
round
common
face
and
fastidiously
dressed
person
gave
him
an
immediate
sense
of
reassurance
he
felt
that
under
the
circle
of
baldness
on
top
of
that
carefully
brushed
head
lay
the
solution
of
every
monetary
problem
that
could
beset
the
soul
of
man
moffatt
voice
had
recovered
its
usual
cordial
note
and
the
warmth
of
his
welcome
dispelled
ralph
last
apprehension
why
yes
everything
going
along
they
thought
they
hung
us
up
last
week
but
they
have
there
may
be
another
week
delay
but
we
ought
to
be
opening
a
bottle
of
wine
on
it
by
the
fourth
an
came
in
with
a
name
on
a
slip
of
paper
and
moffatt
looked
at
his
watch
and
held
out
a
hearty
hand
glad
you
came
of
course
keep
you
posted
no
this
way
look
in
again
and
he
steered
ralph
out
by
another
door
july
came
and
passed
into
its
second
week
ralph
lawyer
had
obtained
a
postponement
from
the
other
side
but
undine
representatives
had
given
him
to
understand
that
the
transaction
must
be
closed
before
the
first
of
august
ralph
telephoned
once
or
twice
to
moffatt
receiving
assurances
that
everything
was
going
their
way
but
he
felt
a
certain
embarrassment
in
returning
again
to
the
office
and
let
himself
drift
through
the
days
in
a
state
of
hungry
apprehension
finally
one
afternoon
henley
fairford
coming
back
from
town
which
ralph
had
left
in
the
morning
to
join
his
boy
over
sunday
brought
word
that
the
apex
consolidation
scheme
had
failed
to
get
its
charter
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
reach
moffatt
on
sunday
and
ralph
wore
on
as
he
could
through
the
succeeding
hours
clare
van
degen
had
come
down
to
stay
with
her
youngest
boy
and
in
the
afternoon
she
and
ralph
took
the
two
children
for
a
sail
a
light
breeze
brightened
the
waters
of
the
sound
and
they
ran
down
the
shore
before
it
and
then
tacked
out
toward
the
sunset
coming
back
at
last
under
a
failing
breeze
as
the
summer
sky
passed
from
blue
to
a
translucid
green
and
then
into
the
accumulating
greys
of
twilight
as
they
left
the
landing
and
walked
up
behind
the
children
across
the
darkening
lawn
a
sense
of
security
descended
again
on
ralph
he
could
not
believe
that
such
a
scene
and
such
a
mood
could
be
the
disguise
of
any
impending
evil
and
all
his
doubts
and
anxieties
fell
away
from
him
the
next
morning
he
and
clare
travelled
up
to
town
together
and
at
the
station
he
put
her
in
the
motor
which
was
to
take
her
to
long
island
and
hastened
down
to
moffatt
office
when
he
arrived
he
was
told
that
moffatt
was
engaged
and
he
had
to
wait
for
nearly
half
an
hour
in
the
outer
office
where
to
the
steady
click
of
the
and
the
spasmodic
buzzing
of
the
telephone
his
thoughts
again
began
their
restless
circlings
finally
the
inner
door
opened
and
he
found
himself
in
the
sanctuary
moffatt
was
seated
behind
his
desk
examining
another
little
crystal
vase
somewhat
like
the
one
he
had
shown
ralph
a
few
weeks
earlier
as
his
visitor
entered
he
held
it
up
against
the
light
revealing
on
its
dewy
sides
an
incised
design
as
frail
as
the
shadow
of
on
water
ai
she
a
peach
he
put
the
toy
down
and
reached
across
the
desk
to
shake
hands
well
well
he
went
on
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
pushing
out
his
lower
lip
in
a
pout
they
got
us
in
the
neck
this
time
and
no
mistake
seen
this
morning
radiator
i
know
how
the
thing
leaked
out
but
the
reformers
somehow
got
a
smell
of
the
scheme
and
whenever
they
get
swishing
round
something
bound
to
get
spilt
he
talked
gaily
genially
in
his
roundest
tones
and
with
his
easiest
gestures
never
had
he
conveyed
a
completer
sense
of
unhurried
power
but
ralph
noticed
for
the
first
time
the
about
his
eyes
and
the
sharpness
of
the
contrast
between
the
white
of
his
forehead
and
the
redness
of
the
fold
of
neck
above
his
collar
do
you
mean
to
say
it
not
going
through
not
this
time
anyhow
we
high
and
dry
something
seemed
to
snap
in
ralph
head
and
he
sat
down
in
the
nearest
chair
has
the
common
stock
dropped
a
lot
well
you
got
to
lean
over
to
see
it
moffatt
pressed
his
together
and
added
thoughtfully
but
it
there
all
right
we
bound
to
get
our
charter
in
the
end
what
do
you
call
the
end
oh
before
the
day
of
judgment
sure
next
year
i
guess
next
year
ralph
flushed
what
earthly
good
will
that
do
me
i
do
say
it
as
pleasant
as
driving
your
best
girl
home
by
moonlight
but
that
how
it
is
and
the
stuff
safe
enough
any
way
i
told
you
that
right
along
but
you
told
me
all
along
i
could
count
on
a
rise
before
august
you
knew
i
had
to
have
the
money
now
i
knew
you
wanted
to
have
the
money
now
and
so
did
i
and
several
of
my
friends
i
put
you
onto
it
because
it
was
the
only
thing
in
sight
likely
to
give
you
the
return
you
wanted
you
ought
at
least
to
have
warned
me
of
the
risk
risk
i
do
call
it
much
of
a
risk
to
lie
back
in
your
chair
and
wait
another
few
months
for
fifty
thousand
to
drop
into
your
lap
i
tell
you
the
thing
as
safe
as
a
bank
how
do
i
know
it
is
you
misled
me
about
it
from
the
first
moffatt
face
grew
dark
red
to
the
forehead
for
the
first
time
in
their
acquaintance
ralph
saw
him
on
the
verge
of
anger
well
if
you
get
stuck
so
do
i
in
it
a
good
deal
deeper
than
you
that
about
the
best
guarantee
i
can
give
unless
you
wo
take
my
word
for
that
either
to
control
himself
moffatt
spoke
with
extreme
deliberation
separating
his
syllables
like
a
machine
cutting
something
into
even
lengths
ralph
listened
through
a
cloud
of
confusion
but
he
saw
the
madness
of
offending
moffatt
and
tried
to
take
a
more
conciliatory
tone
of
course
i
take
your
word
for
it
but
i
ca
i
simply
ca
afford
to
lose
you
ai
going
to
lose
i
do
believe
you
even
have
to
put
up
any
margin
it
there
safe
enough
i
tell
you
yes
yes
i
understand
i
sure
you
would
have
advised
me
ralph
tongue
seemed
swollen
and
he
had
difficulty
in
bringing
out
the
words
only
you
see
i
ca
wait
it
not
possible
and
i
want
to
know
if
there
is
a
way
moffatt
looked
at
him
with
a
sort
of
resigned
compassion
as
a
doctor
looks
at
a
despairing
mother
who
will
not
understand
what
he
has
tried
to
imply
without
uttering
the
word
she
dreads
ralph
understood
the
look
but
hurried
on
you
think
i
mad
or
an
ass
to
talk
like
this
but
the
fact
is
i
must
have
the
money
he
waited
and
drew
a
hard
breath
i
must
have
it
that
all
perhaps
i
better
tell
you
moffatt
who
had
risen
as
if
assuming
that
the
interview
was
over
sat
down
again
and
turned
an
attentive
look
on
him
go
ahead
he
said
more
humanly
than
he
had
hitherto
spoken
my
boy
you
spoke
of
him
the
other
day
i
awfully
fond
of
him
ralph
broke
off
deterred
by
the
impossibility
of
confiding
his
feeling
for
paul
to
this
man
with
whom
he
had
a
sentiment
in
common
moffatt
was
still
looking
at
him
i
should
say
you
would
be
he
as
smart
a
little
chap
as
i
ever
saw
and
i
guess
he
the
kind
that
gets
better
every
day
ralph
had
collected
himself
and
went
on
with
sudden
resolution
well
you
see
when
my
wife
and
i
separated
i
never
dreamed
she
want
the
boy
the
question
never
came
up
if
it
had
of
course
but
she
left
him
with
me
when
she
went
away
two
years
before
and
at
the
time
of
the
divorce
i
was
a
fool
i
did
take
the
proper
steps
you
mean
she
got
sole
custody
ralph
made
a
sign
of
assent
and
moffatt
pondered
that
bad
bad
and
now
i
understand
she
going
to
marry
again
and
of
course
i
give
up
my
son
she
wants
you
to
eh
ralph
again
assented
moffatt
swung
his
chair
about
and
leaned
back
in
it
stretching
out
his
plump
legs
and
contemplating
the
tips
of
his
varnished
boots
he
hummed
a
low
tune
behind
inscrutable
lips
that
what
you
want
the
money
for
he
finally
raised
his
head
to
ask
the
word
came
out
of
the
depths
of
ralph
anguish
yes
and
why
you
want
it
in
such
a
hurry
i
see
moffatt
reverted
to
the
study
of
his
boots
it
a
lot
of
money
yes
that
the
difficulty
and
i
she
ralph
tongue
was
again
too
thick
for
his
mouth
i
afraid
she
wait
or
take
less
moffatt
abandoning
the
boots
was
scrutinizing
him
through
lids
no
he
said
slowly
i
do
believe
undine
spragg
take
a
single
cent
less
ralph
felt
himself
whiten
was
it
insolence
or
ignorance
that
had
prompted
moffatt
speech
nothing
in
his
voice
or
face
showed
the
sense
of
any
shades
of
expression
or
of
feeling
he
seemed
to
apply
to
everything
the
measure
of
the
same
crude
flippancy
but
such
considerations
could
not
curb
ralph
now
he
said
to
himself
keep
your
temper
keep
your
temper
and
his
anger
suddenly
boiled
over
look
here
moffatt
he
said
getting
to
his
feet
the
fact
that
been
divorced
from
marvell
does
authorize
any
one
to
take
that
tone
to
me
in
speaking
of
her
moffatt
met
the
challenge
with
a
calm
stare
under
which
there
were
dawning
signs
of
surprise
and
interest
that
so
well
if
that
the
case
i
presume
i
ought
to
feel
the
same
way
i
been
divorced
from
her
myself
for
an
instant
the
words
conveyed
no
meaning
to
ralph
then
they
surged
up
into
his
brain
and
flung
him
forward
with
arm
but
he
felt
the
grotesqueness
of
the
gesture
and
his
arm
dropped
back
to
his
side
a
series
of
unimportant
and
irrelevant
things
raced
through
his
mind
then
obscurity
settled
down
on
it
this
man
this
man
was
the
one
fiery
point
in
his
darkened
consciousness
what
on
earth
are
you
talking
about
he
brought
out
why
facts
said
moffatt
in
a
cool
voice
you
know
i
understood
from
marvell
your
folks
had
a
prejudice
against
divorce
so
i
suppose
she
kept
quiet
about
that
early
episode
the
truth
is
he
continued
amicably
i
would
have
alluded
to
it
now
if
you
had
taken
rather
a
high
tone
with
me
about
our
little
venture
but
now
it
out
i
guess
you
may
as
well
hear
the
whole
story
it
mighty
wholesome
for
a
man
to
have
a
round
now
and
then
with
a
few
facts
shall
i
go
on
ralph
had
stood
listening
without
a
sign
but
as
moffatt
ended
he
made
a
slight
motion
of
acquiescence
he
did
not
otherwise
change
his
attitude
except
to
grasp
with
one
hand
the
back
of
the
chair
that
moffatt
pushed
toward
him
rather
stand
moffatt
himself
dropped
back
into
his
seat
and
took
the
pose
of
easy
narrative
well
it
was
this
way
undine
spragg
and
i
were
made
one
at
opake
nebraska
just
nine
years
ago
last
month
my
she
was
a
beauty
then
nothing
much
had
happened
to
her
before
but
being
engaged
for
a
year
or
two
to
a
soft
called
millard
binch
the
same
she
passed
on
to
indiana
rolliver
and
well
i
guess
she
liked
the
change
we
did
have
what
you
called
a
society
wedding
no
best
man
or
bridesmaids
or
voice
that
breathed
eden
fact
is
pa
and
ma
know
about
it
till
it
was
over
but
it
was
a
marriage
fast
enough
as
they
found
out
when
they
tried
to
undo
it
trouble
was
they
caught
on
too
soon
we
only
had
a
fortnight
then
they
hauled
undine
back
to
apex
and
well
i
had
the
cash
or
the
pull
to
fight
uncle
abner
was
a
pretty
big
man
out
there
then
and
he
had
james
rolliver
behind
him
i
always
know
when
i
licked
and
i
was
licked
that
time
so
we
unlooped
the
loop
and
they
fixed
it
up
for
me
to
make
a
trip
to
alaska
let
me
see
that
was
the
year
before
they
moved
over
to
new
york
next
time
i
saw
undine
i
sat
alongside
of
her
at
the
theatre
the
day
your
engagement
was
announced
he
still
kept
to
his
minor
key
as
though
he
were
in
the
first
stages
of
an
speech
but
as
he
went
on
his
bodily
presence
which
hitherto
had
seemed
to
ralph
the
mere
average
garment
of
vulgarity
began
to
loom
huge
and
portentous
as
some
monster
released
from
a
magician
bottle
his
redness
his
glossiness
his
baldness
and
the
carefully
brushed
ring
of
hair
encircling
it
the
square
line
of
his
shoulders
the
too
careful
fit
of
his
clothes
the
prominent
lustre
of
his
the
growth
of
short
black
hair
on
his
manicured
hands
even
the
tiny
cracks
and
beginning
to
show
in
the
hard
close
surface
of
his
complexion
all
these
solid
witnesses
to
his
reality
and
his
proximity
pressed
on
ralph
with
the
mounting
pang
of
physical
nausea
this
man
this
man
he
could
get
beyond
the
thought
whichever
way
he
turned
his
haggard
thought
there
was
moffatt
bodily
blocking
the
perspective
ralph
eyes
roamed
toward
the
crystal
toy
that
stood
on
the
desk
beside
moffatt
hand
faugh
that
such
a
hand
should
have
touched
it
suddenly
he
heard
himself
speaking
before
my
marriage
did
you
know
they
had
told
me
why
i
understood
as
much
ralph
pushed
on
you
knew
it
the
day
i
met
you
in
spragg
office
moffatt
considered
a
moment
as
if
the
incident
had
escaped
him
did
we
meet
there
he
seemed
benevolently
ready
for
enlightenment
but
ralph
had
been
assailed
by
another
memory
he
recalled
that
moffatt
had
dined
one
night
in
his
house
that
he
and
the
man
who
now
faced
him
had
sat
at
the
same
table
their
wife
between
them
he
was
seized
with
another
dumb
gust
of
fury
but
it
died
out
and
left
him
face
to
face
with
the
uselessness
the
irrelevance
of
all
the
old
attitudes
of
appropriation
and
defiance
he
seemed
to
be
stumbling
about
in
his
inherited
prejudices
like
a
modern
man
in
mediaeval
armour
moffatt
still
sat
at
his
desk
unmoved
and
apparently
uncomprehending
he
does
even
know
what
i
feeling
flashed
through
ralph
and
the
whole
archaic
structure
of
his
rites
and
sanctions
tumbled
down
about
him
through
the
noise
of
the
crash
he
heard
moffatt
voice
going
on
without
perceptible
change
of
tone
about
that
other
matter
now
you
feel
any
meaner
about
it
than
i
do
i
can
tell
you
that
but
all
got
to
do
is
to
sit
tight
ralph
turned
from
the
voice
and
found
himself
outside
on
the
landing
and
then
in
the
street
below
xxxvi
he
stood
at
the
corner
of
wall
street
looking
up
and
down
its
hot
summer
perspective
he
noticed
the
swirls
of
dust
in
the
cracks
of
the
pavement
the
rubbish
in
the
gutters
the
ceaseless
stream
of
perspiring
faces
that
poured
by
under
tilted
hats
he
found
himself
next
slipping
northward
between
the
glazed
walls
of
the
subway
another
languid
crowd
in
the
seats
about
him
and
the
nasal
yelp
of
the
stations
ringing
through
the
car
like
some
repeated
ritual
wail
the
blindness
within
him
seemed
to
have
intensified
his
physical
perceptions
his
sensitiveness
to
the
heat
the
noise
the
smells
of
the
dishevelled
midsummer
city
but
combined
with
the
acuter
perception
of
these
offenses
was
a
complete
indifference
to
them
as
though
he
were
some
vivisected
animal
deprived
of
the
power
of
discrimination
now
he
had
turned
into
waverly
place
and
was
walking
westward
toward
washington
square
at
the
corner
he
pulled
himself
up
saying
the
office
i
ought
to
be
at
the
office
he
drew
out
his
watch
and
stared
at
it
blankly
what
the
devil
had
he
taken
it
out
for
he
had
to
go
through
a
laborious
process
of
readjustment
to
find
out
what
it
had
to
say
twelve
should
he
turn
back
to
the
office
it
seemed
easier
to
cross
the
square
go
up
the
steps
of
the
old
house
and
slip
his
key
into
the
door
the
house
was
empty
his
mother
a
few
days
previously
had
departed
with
dagonet
for
their
usual
two
months
on
the
maine
coast
where
ralph
was
to
join
them
with
his
boy
the
blinds
were
all
drawn
down
and
the
freshness
and
silence
of
the
hall
laid
soothing
hands
on
him
he
said
to
himself
i
jump
into
a
cab
presently
and
go
and
lunch
at
the
club
he
laid
down
his
hat
and
stick
and
climbed
the
carpetless
stairs
to
his
room
when
he
entered
it
he
had
the
shock
of
feeling
himself
in
a
strange
place
it
did
not
seem
like
anything
he
had
ever
seen
before
then
one
by
one
all
the
old
stale
usual
things
in
it
confronted
him
and
he
longed
with
a
sick
intensity
to
be
in
a
place
that
was
really
strange
how
on
earth
can
i
go
on
living
here
he
wondered
a
careless
servant
had
left
the
outer
shutters
open
and
the
sun
was
beating
on
the
ralph
pushed
open
the
windows
shut
the
shutters
and
wandered
toward
his
beads
of
perspiration
stood
on
his
forehead
the
temperature
of
the
room
reminded
him
of
the
heat
under
the
ilexes
of
the
sienese
villa
where
he
and
undine
had
sat
through
a
long
july
afternoon
he
saw
her
before
him
leaning
against
the
in
her
white
dress
limpid
and
inscrutable
we
were
made
one
at
opake
nebraska
had
she
been
thinking
of
it
that
afternoon
at
siena
he
wondered
did
she
ever
think
of
it
at
all
it
was
she
who
had
asked
moffatt
to
dine
she
had
said
father
brought
him
home
one
day
at
apex
i
do
remember
ever
having
seen
him
since
and
the
man
she
spoke
of
had
had
her
in
his
arms
and
perhaps
it
was
really
all
she
remembered
she
had
lied
to
him
lied
to
him
from
the
first
there
had
been
a
moment
when
she
had
lied
to
him
deliberately
ingeniously
and
inventively
as
he
thought
of
it
there
came
to
him
for
the
first
time
in
months
that
overwhelming
sense
of
her
physical
nearness
which
had
once
so
haunted
and
tortured
him
her
freshness
her
fragrance
the
luminous
haze
of
her
youth
filled
the
room
with
a
mocking
glory
and
he
dropped
his
head
on
his
hands
to
shut
it
out
the
vision
was
swept
away
by
another
wave
of
hurrying
thoughts
he
felt
it
was
intensely
important
that
he
should
keep
the
thread
of
every
one
of
them
that
they
all
represented
things
to
be
said
or
done
or
guarded
against
and
his
mind
with
the
unwondering
versatility
and
tireless
haste
of
the
dreamer
brain
seemed
to
be
pursuing
them
all
simultaneously
then
they
became
as
unreal
and
meaningless
as
the
red
specks
dancing
behind
the
lids
against
which
he
had
pressed
his
fists
clenched
and
he
had
the
feeling
that
if
he
opened
his
eyes
they
would
vanish
and
the
familiar
daylight
look
in
on
him
a
knock
disturbed
him
the
old
who
was
always
left
in
charge
of
the
house
had
come
up
to
ask
if
he
was
well
and
if
there
was
anything
she
could
do
for
him
he
told
her
no
he
was
perfectly
well
or
rather
no
he
was
he
supposed
it
must
be
the
heat
and
he
began
to
scold
her
for
having
forgotten
to
close
the
shutters
it
was
her
fault
it
appeared
but
eliza
her
tone
implied
that
he
knew
what
one
had
to
expect
of
eliza
and
would
he
go
down
to
the
nice
cool
shady
and
let
her
make
him
an
iced
drink
and
a
few
sandwiches
i
always
told
marvell
i
could
turn
my
back
for
a
second
but
what
eliza
find
a
way
to
make
trouble
the
old
woman
continued
evidently
glad
of
the
chance
to
air
a
perennial
grievance
it
not
only
the
things
she
forgets
to
do
she
added
significantly
and
it
dawned
on
ralph
that
she
was
making
an
appeal
to
him
expecting
him
to
take
sides
with
her
in
the
chronic
conflict
between
herself
and
eliza
he
said
to
himself
that
perhaps
she
was
right
that
perhaps
there
was
something
he
ought
to
do
that
his
mother
was
old
and
did
always
see
things
and
for
a
while
his
mind
revolved
this
problem
with
feverish
intensity
then
you
come
down
sir
yes
the
door
closed
and
he
heard
her
heavy
heels
along
the
passage
but
the
money
where
the
money
to
come
from
the
question
sprang
out
from
some
denser
fold
of
the
fog
in
his
brain
the
money
how
on
earth
was
he
to
pay
it
back
how
could
he
have
wasted
his
time
in
thinking
of
anything
else
while
that
central
difficulty
existed
but
i
ca
i
ca
it
gone
and
even
if
it
were
he
dropped
back
in
his
chair
and
took
his
head
between
his
hands
he
had
forgotten
what
he
wanted
the
money
for
he
made
a
great
effort
to
regain
hold
of
the
idea
but
all
the
whirring
shuttling
flying
had
abruptly
ceased
in
his
brain
and
he
sat
with
his
eyes
shut
staring
straight
into
darkness
the
clock
struck
and
he
remembered
that
he
had
said
he
would
go
down
to
the
if
i
do
she
come
up
he
raised
his
head
and
sat
listening
for
the
sound
of
the
old
woman
step
it
seemed
to
him
perfectly
intolerable
that
any
one
should
cross
the
threshold
of
the
room
again
why
ca
they
leave
me
alone
he
groaned
at
length
through
the
silence
of
the
empty
house
he
fancied
he
heard
a
door
opening
and
closing
far
below
and
he
said
to
himself
she
coming
he
got
to
his
feet
and
went
to
the
door
he
did
feel
anything
now
except
the
insane
dread
of
hearing
the
woman
steps
come
nearer
he
bolted
the
door
and
stood
looking
about
the
room
for
a
moment
he
was
conscious
of
seeing
it
in
every
detail
with
a
distinctness
he
had
never
before
known
then
everything
in
it
vanished
but
the
single
narrow
panel
of
a
drawer
under
one
of
the
bookcases
he
went
up
to
the
drawer
knelt
down
and
slipped
his
hand
into
it
as
he
raised
himself
he
listened
again
and
this
time
he
distinctly
heard
the
old
servant
steps
on
the
stairs
he
passed
his
left
hand
over
the
side
of
his
head
and
down
the
curve
of
the
skull
behind
the
ear
he
said
to
himself
my
wife
this
will
make
it
all
right
for
her
and
a
last
flash
of
irony
twitched
through
him
then
he
felt
again
more
deliberately
for
the
spot
he
wanted
and
put
the
muzzle
of
his
revolver
against
it
xxxvii
in
a
hung
with
portraits
of
personages
in
perukes
and
orders
a
circle
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
looking
not
unlike
versions
of
the
official
figures
above
their
heads
sat
examining
with
friendly
interest
a
little
boy
in
mourning
the
boy
was
slim
fair
and
shy
and
his
small
black
figure
islanded
in
the
middle
of
the
wide
lustrous
floor
looked
curiously
lonely
and
remote
this
effect
of
remoteness
seemed
to
strike
his
mother
as
something
intentional
and
almost
naughty
for
after
having
launched
him
from
the
door
and
waited
to
judge
of
the
impression
he
produced
she
came
forward
and
giving
him
a
slight
push
said
impatiently
paul
why
do
you
go
and
kiss
your
new
granny
the
boy
without
turning
to
her
or
moving
sent
his
blue
glance
gravely
about
the
circle
does
she
want
me
to
he
asked
in
a
tone
of
evident
apprehension
and
on
his
mother
answering
of
course
you
silly
he
added
earnestly
how
many
more
do
you
think
there
be
undine
blushed
to
the
ripples
of
her
brilliant
hair
i
never
knew
such
a
child
they
turned
him
into
a
perfect
little
savage
raymond
de
chelles
advanced
from
behind
his
mother
chair
he
wo
be
a
savage
long
with
me
he
said
stooping
down
so
that
his
fatigued
face
was
close
to
paul
their
eyes
met
and
the
boy
smiled
come
along
old
chap
chelles
continued
in
english
drawing
the
little
boy
after
him
il
est
bien
beau
the
marquise
de
chelles
observed
her
eyes
turning
from
paul
grave
face
to
her
vivid
countenance
do
be
nice
darling
say
madame
undine
urged
an
odd
mingling
of
emotions
stirred
in
her
while
she
stood
watching
paul
make
the
round
of
the
family
group
under
her
husband
guidance
it
was
lovely
to
have
the
child
back
and
to
find
him
after
their
three
years
separation
grown
into
so
endearing
a
figure
her
first
glimpse
of
him
when
in
heeny
arms
he
had
emerged
that
morning
from
the
steamer
train
had
shown
what
an
acquisition
he
would
be
if
she
had
had
any
lingering
doubts
on
the
point
the
impression
produced
on
her
husband
would
have
dispelled
them
chelles
had
been
instantly
charmed
and
paul
in
a
shy
confused
way
was
already
responding
to
his
advances
the
count
and
countess
raymond
had
returned
but
a
few
weeks
before
from
their
protracted
wedding
journey
and
were
staying
as
they
were
apparently
to
do
whenever
they
came
to
paris
with
the
old
marquis
raymond
father
who
had
amicably
proposed
that
little
paul
marvell
should
also
share
the
hospitality
of
the
hotel
de
chelles
undine
at
first
was
somewhat
dismayed
to
find
that
she
was
expected
to
fit
the
boy
and
his
nurse
into
a
corner
of
her
contracted
entresol
but
the
possibility
of
a
mother
not
finding
room
for
her
son
however
cramped
her
own
quarters
seemed
not
to
have
occurred
to
her
new
relations
and
the
preparing
of
her
and
boudoir
for
paul
occupancy
was
carried
on
by
the
household
with
a
zeal
which
obliged
her
to
dissemble
her
lukewarmness
undine
had
supposed
that
on
her
marriage
one
of
the
great
suites
of
the
hotel
de
chelles
would
be
emptied
of
its
tenants
and
put
at
her
husband
disposal
but
she
had
since
learned
that
even
had
such
a
plan
occurred
to
her
considerations
of
economy
would
have
hindered
it
the
old
marquis
and
his
wife
who
were
content
when
they
came
up
from
burgundy
in
the
spring
with
a
modest
set
of
rooms
looking
out
on
the
court
of
their
ancestral
residence
expected
their
son
and
his
wife
to
fit
themselves
into
the
still
smaller
apartment
which
had
served
as
raymond
bachelor
lodging
the
rest
of
the
fine
old
mouldering
house
the
premier
on
the
garden
and
the
whole
of
the
floor
above
had
been
let
for
years
to
old
fashioned
tenants
who
would
have
been
more
surprised
than
their
landlord
had
he
suddenly
proposed
to
dispossess
them
undine
at
first
had
regarded
these
arrangements
as
merely
provisional
she
was
persuaded
that
under
her
influence
raymond
would
soon
convert
his
parents
to
more
modern
ideas
and
meanwhile
she
was
still
in
the
flush
of
a
completer
than
she
had
ever
known
and
disposed
for
the
moment
to
make
light
of
any
inconveniences
connected
with
it
the
three
months
since
her
marriage
had
been
more
nearly
like
what
she
had
dreamed
of
than
any
of
her
previous
experiments
in
happiness
at
last
she
had
what
she
wanted
and
for
the
first
time
the
glow
of
triumph
was
warmed
by
a
deeper
feeling
her
husband
was
really
charming
it
was
odd
how
he
reminded
her
of
ralph
and
after
her
bitter
two
years
of
loneliness
and
humiliation
it
was
delicious
to
find
herself
once
more
adored
and
protected
the
very
fact
that
raymond
was
more
jealous
of
her
than
ralph
had
ever
been
or
at
any
rate
less
reluctant
to
show
it
gave
her
a
keener
sense
of
recovered
power
none
of
the
men
who
had
been
in
love
with
her
before
had
been
so
frankly
possessive
or
so
eager
for
reciprocal
assurances
of
constancy
she
knew
that
ralph
had
suffered
deeply
from
her
intimacy
with
van
degen
but
he
had
betrayed
his
feeling
only
by
a
more
studied
detachment
and
van
degen
from
the
first
had
been
contemptuously
indifferent
to
what
she
did
or
felt
when
she
was
out
of
his
sight
as
to
her
earlier
experiences
she
had
frankly
forgotten
them
her
sentimental
memories
went
back
no
farther
than
the
beginning
of
her
new
york
career
raymond
seemed
to
attach
more
importance
to
love
in
all
its
manifestations
than
was
usual
or
convenient
in
a
husband
and
she
gradually
began
to
be
aware
that
her
domination
over
him
involved
a
corresponding
loss
of
independence
since
their
return
to
paris
she
had
found
that
she
was
expected
to
give
a
circumstantial
report
of
every
hour
she
spent
away
from
him
she
had
nothing
to
hide
and
no
designs
against
his
peace
of
mind
except
those
connected
with
her
frequent
and
costly
sessions
at
the
but
she
had
never
before
been
called
upon
to
account
to
any
one
for
the
use
of
her
time
and
after
the
first
amused
surprise
at
raymond
always
wanting
to
know
where
she
had
been
and
whom
she
had
seen
she
began
to
be
oppressed
by
so
exacting
a
devotion
her
parents
from
her
tenderest
youth
had
tacitly
recognized
her
inalienable
right
to
go
round
and
ralph
though
from
motives
which
she
divined
to
be
different
had
shown
the
same
respect
for
her
freedom
it
was
therefore
disconcerting
to
find
that
raymond
expected
her
to
choose
her
friends
and
even
her
acquaintances
in
conformity
not
only
with
his
personal
tastes
but
with
a
definite
and
complicated
code
of
family
prejudices
and
traditions
and
she
was
especially
surprised
to
discover
that
he
viewed
with
disapproval
her
intimacy
with
the
princess
estradina
my
cousin
extremely
amusing
of
course
but
utterly
mad
and
very
mal
entourée
most
of
the
people
she
has
about
her
ought
to
be
in
prison
or
bedlam
especially
that
unspeakable
madame
adelschein
who
a
candidate
for
both
my
aunt
an
angel
but
she
been
weak
enough
to
let
lili
turn
the
hotel
de
dordogne
into
an
annex
of
montmartre
of
course
have
to
show
yourself
there
now
and
then
in
these
days
families
like
ours
must
hold
together
but
go
to
the
reunions
de
famille
rather
than
to
lili
intimate
parties
go
with
me
or
with
my
mother
do
let
yourself
be
seen
there
alone
you
too
young
and
to
be
mixed
up
with
that
crew
a
woman
classed
or
rather
unclassed
by
being
known
as
one
of
lili
set
agreeable
as
it
was
to
undine
that
an
appeal
to
her
discretion
should
be
based
on
the
ground
of
her
youth
and
she
was
dismayed
to
find
herself
cut
off
from
the
very
circle
she
had
meant
them
to
establish
her
in
before
she
had
become
raymond
wife
there
had
been
a
moment
of
sharp
tension
in
her
relations
with
the
princess
estradina
and
the
old
duchess
they
had
done
their
best
to
prevent
her
marrying
their
cousin
and
had
gone
so
far
as
openly
to
accuse
her
of
being
the
cause
of
a
breach
between
themselves
and
his
parents
but
ralph
death
had
brought
about
a
sudden
change
in
her
situation
she
was
now
no
longer
a
divorced
woman
struggling
to
obtain
ecclesiastical
sanction
for
her
remarriage
but
a
widow
whose
conspicuous
beauty
and
independent
situation
made
her
the
object
of
lawful
aspirations
the
first
person
to
seize
on
this
distinction
and
make
the
most
of
it
was
her
old
enemy
the
marquise
de
trezac
the
latter
who
had
been
loudly
charged
by
the
house
of
chelles
with
furthering
her
beautiful
compatriot
designs
had
instantly
seen
a
chance
of
vindicating
herself
by
taking
the
widowed
marvell
under
her
wing
and
favouring
the
attentions
of
other
suitors
these
were
not
lacking
and
the
expected
result
had
followed
raymond
de
chelles
more
than
ever
infatuated
as
attainment
became
less
certain
had
claimed
a
definite
promise
from
undine
and
his
family
discouraged
by
his
persistent
bachelorhood
and
their
failure
to
fix
his
attention
on
any
of
the
amiable
maidens
obviously
designed
to
continue
the
race
had
ended
by
withdrawing
their
opposition
and
discovering
in
marvell
the
moral
and
financial
merits
necessary
to
justify
their
change
of
front
a
good
match
if
she
is
i
should
like
to
know
what
the
chelles
call
one
madame
de
trezac
went
about
indefatigably
proclaiming
related
to
the
best
people
in
new
york
well
by
marriage
that
is
and
her
husband
left
much
more
money
than
was
expected
it
goes
to
the
boy
of
course
but
as
the
boy
is
with
his
mother
she
naturally
enjoys
the
income
and
her
father
a
rich
man
much
richer
than
is
generally
known
i
mean
what
we
call
rich
in
america
you
understand
madame
de
trezac
had
lately
discovered
that
the
proper
attitude
for
the
american
married
abroad
was
that
of
a
militant
patriotism
and
she
flaunted
undine
marvell
in
the
face
of
the
faubourg
like
a
particularly
showy
specimen
of
her
national
banner
the
success
of
the
experiment
emboldened
her
to
throw
off
the
most
sacred
observances
of
her
past
she
took
up
madame
adelschein
she
entertained
the
james
rollivers
she
resuscitated
creole
dishes
she
patronized
negro
melodists
she
abandoned
her
weekly
teas
for
impromptu
afternoon
dances
and
the
prim
in
which
dowagers
had
droned
echoed
with
a
cosmopolitan
hubbub
even
when
the
period
of
tension
was
over
and
undine
had
been
officially
received
into
the
family
of
her
betrothed
madame
de
trezac
did
not
at
once
surrender
she
laughingly
professed
to
have
had
enough
of
the
proprieties
and
declared
herself
bored
by
the
social
rites
she
had
hitherto
so
piously
performed
you
always
find
a
corner
of
home
here
dearest
when
you
get
tired
of
their
ceremonies
and
solemnities
she
said
as
she
embraced
the
bride
after
the
wedding
breakfast
and
undine
hoped
that
the
devoted
nettie
would
in
fact
provide
a
refuge
from
the
extreme
domesticity
of
her
new
state
but
since
her
return
to
paris
and
her
taking
up
her
domicile
in
the
hotel
de
chelles
she
had
found
madame
de
trezac
less
and
less
disposed
to
abet
her
in
any
assertion
of
independence
my
dear
a
woman
must
adopt
her
husband
nationality
whether
she
wants
to
or
not
it
the
law
and
it
the
custom
besides
if
you
wanted
to
amuse
yourself
with
your
nouveau
luxe
friends
you
ought
to
have
married
raymond
but
of
course
i
say
that
only
in
joke
as
if
any
woman
would
have
hesitated
who
had
your
chance
take
my
advice
keep
out
of
lili
set
just
at
first
later
well
perhaps
raymond
wo
be
so
particular
but
meanwhile
you
make
a
great
mistake
to
go
against
his
people
and
madame
de
trezac
with
a
chere
madame
swept
forward
from
her
to
receive
the
first
of
the
returning
dowagers
it
was
about
this
time
that
heeny
arrived
with
paul
and
for
a
while
undine
was
pleasantly
absorbed
in
her
boy
she
kept
heeny
in
paris
for
a
fortnight
and
between
her
more
pressing
occupations
it
amused
her
to
listen
to
the
masseuse
new
york
gossip
and
her
comments
on
the
social
organization
of
the
old
world
it
was
heeny
first
visit
to
europe
and
she
confessed
to
undine
that
she
had
always
wanted
to
see
something
of
the
aristocracy
using
the
phrase
as
a
naturalist
might
with
no
hint
of
personal
pretensions
heeny
democratic
ease
was
combined
with
the
strictest
professional
discretion
and
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
her
to
regard
herself
or
to
wish
others
to
regard
her
as
anything
but
a
manipulator
of
muscles
but
in
that
character
she
felt
herself
entitled
to
admission
to
the
highest
circles
they
certainly
do
things
with
style
over
here
but
it
kinder
after
new
york
ai
it
is
this
what
they
call
their
season
why
you
dined
home
two
nights
last
week
they
ought
to
come
over
to
new
york
and
see
and
she
poured
into
undine
ear
a
list
of
the
entertainments
which
had
illuminated
the
last
weeks
of
the
new
york
winter
i
suppose
you
begin
to
give
parties
as
soon
as
ever
you
get
into
a
house
of
your
own
you
not
going
to
have
one
oh
well
then
you
give
a
lot
of
big
at
your
place
down
in
the
that
where
the
swells
all
go
to
in
the
summer
time
ai
it
but
i
dunno
what
your
ma
would
say
if
she
knew
you
were
going
to
live
on
with
his
folks
after
you
done
why
we
read
in
the
papers
you
were
going
to
live
in
some
grand
hotel
or
other
oh
they
call
their
houses
hotels
do
they
that
funny
i
suppose
because
they
let
out
part
of
well
you
look
handsomer
than
ever
undine
i
take
that
back
to
your
mother
anyhow
and
he
dead
in
love
i
can
see
that
reminds
me
of
the
way
but
she
broke
off
suddenly
as
if
something
in
undine
look
had
silenced
her
even
to
herself
undine
did
not
like
to
call
up
the
image
of
ralph
marvell
and
any
mention
of
his
name
gave
her
a
vague
sense
of
distress
his
death
had
released
her
had
given
her
what
she
wanted
yet
she
could
honestly
say
to
herself
that
she
had
not
wanted
him
to
die
at
least
not
to
die
like
that
people
said
at
the
time
that
it
was
the
hot
weather
his
own
family
had
said
so
he
had
never
quite
got
over
his
attack
of
pneumonia
and
the
sudden
rise
of
temperature
one
of
the
fierce
that
devastate
new
york
in
summer
had
probably
affected
his
brain
the
doctors
said
such
cases
were
not
uncommon
she
had
worn
black
for
a
few
weeks
not
quite
mourning
but
something
decently
regretful
the
were
beginning
to
provide
a
special
garb
for
such
cases
and
even
since
her
remarriage
and
the
lapse
of
a
year
she
continued
to
wish
that
she
could
have
got
what
she
wanted
without
having
had
to
pay
that
particular
price
for
it
this
feeling
was
intensified
by
an
incident
in
itself
far
from
unwelcome
which
had
occurred
about
three
months
after
ralph
death
her
lawyers
had
written
to
say
that
the
sum
of
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
had
been
paid
over
to
marvell
estate
by
the
apex
consolidation
company
and
as
marvell
had
left
a
will
bequeathing
everything
he
possessed
to
his
son
this
unexpected
windfall
handsomely
increased
paul
patrimony
undine
had
never
relinquished
her
claim
on
her
child
she
had
merely
by
the
advice
of
her
lawyers
waived
the
assertion
of
her
right
for
a
few
months
after
marvell
death
with
the
express
stipulation
that
her
doing
so
was
only
a
temporary
concession
to
the
feelings
of
her
husband
family
and
she
had
held
out
against
all
attempts
to
induce
her
to
surrender
paul
permanently
before
her
marriage
she
had
somewhat
conspicuously
adopted
her
husband
creed
and
the
dagonets
picturing
paul
as
the
prey
of
the
jesuits
had
made
the
mistake
of
appealing
to
the
courts
for
his
custody
this
had
confirmed
undine
resistance
and
her
determination
to
keep
the
child
the
case
had
been
decided
in
her
favour
and
she
had
thereupon
demanded
and
obtained
an
allowance
of
five
thousand
dollars
to
be
devoted
to
the
bringing
up
and
education
of
her
son
this
sum
added
to
what
spragg
had
agreed
to
give
her
made
up
an
income
which
had
appreciably
bettered
her
position
and
justified
madame
de
trezac
discreet
allusions
to
her
wealth
nevertheless
it
was
one
of
the
facts
about
which
she
least
liked
to
think
when
any
chance
allusion
evoked
ralph
image
the
money
was
hers
of
course
she
had
a
right
to
it
and
she
was
an
ardent
believer
in
rights
but
she
wished
she
could
have
got
it
in
some
other
way
she
hated
the
thought
of
it
as
one
more
instance
of
the
perverseness
with
which
things
she
was
entitled
to
always
came
to
her
as
if
they
had
been
stolen
the
approach
of
summer
and
the
culmination
of
the
paris
season
swept
aside
such
thoughts
the
countess
raymond
de
chelles
contrasting
her
situation
with
that
of
undine
marvell
and
the
fulness
and
animation
of
her
new
life
with
the
vacant
dissatisfied
days
which
had
followed
on
her
return
from
dakota
forgot
the
smallness
of
her
apartment
the
inconvenient
proximity
of
paul
and
his
nurse
the
interminable
round
of
visits
with
her
and
the
long
dinners
in
the
solemn
hotels
of
all
the
family
connection
the
world
was
radiant
the
lights
were
lit
the
music
playing
she
was
still
young
and
than
ever
with
a
countess
coronet
a
famous
chateau
and
a
handsome
and
popular
husband
who
adored
her
and
then
suddenly
the
lights
went
out
and
the
music
stopped
when
one
day
raymond
putting
his
arm
about
her
said
in
his
tenderest
tones
and
now
my
dear
the
world
had
you
long
enough
and
it
my
turn
what
do
you
say
to
going
down
to
saint
desert
xxxviii
in
a
window
of
the
long
gallery
of
the
chateau
de
saint
desert
the
new
marquise
de
chelles
stood
looking
down
the
poplar
avenue
into
the
november
rain
it
had
been
raining
heavily
and
persistently
for
a
longer
time
than
she
could
remember
day
after
day
the
hills
beyond
the
park
had
been
curtained
by
motionless
clouds
the
gutters
of
the
long
steep
roofs
had
gurgled
with
a
perpetual
overflow
the
opaque
surface
of
the
moat
been
peppered
by
a
continuous
pelting
of
big
drops
the
water
lay
in
glassy
stretches
under
the
trees
and
along
the
sodden
edges
of
the
it
rose
in
a
white
mist
from
the
fields
beyond
it
exuded
in
a
chill
moisture
from
the
brick
flooring
of
the
passages
and
from
the
walls
of
the
rooms
on
the
lower
floor
everything
in
the
great
empty
house
smelt
of
dampness
the
stuffing
of
the
chairs
the
threadbare
folds
of
the
faded
curtains
the
splendid
tapestries
that
were
fading
too
on
the
walls
of
the
room
in
which
undine
stood
and
the
wide
bands
of
crape
which
her
husband
had
insisted
on
her
keeping
on
her
black
dresses
till
the
last
hour
of
her
mourning
for
the
old
marquis
the
summer
had
been
more
than
usually
inclement
and
since
her
first
coming
to
the
country
undine
had
lived
through
many
periods
of
rainy
weather
but
none
which
had
gone
before
had
so
completely
epitomized
so
summed
up
in
one
vast
monotonous
blur
the
image
of
her
long
months
at
saint
desert
when
the
year
before
she
had
reluctantly
suffered
herself
to
be
torn
from
the
joys
of
paris
she
had
been
sustained
by
the
belief
that
her
exile
would
not
be
of
long
duration
once
paris
was
out
of
sight
she
had
even
found
a
certain
lazy
charm
in
the
long
warm
days
at
saint
desert
her
had
remained
in
town
and
she
enjoyed
being
alone
with
her
husband
exploring
and
appraising
the
treasures
of
the
great
half
abandoned
house
and
watching
her
boy
scamper
over
the
june
meadows
or
trot
about
the
gardens
on
the
poney
his
stepfather
had
given
him
paul
after
heeny
departure
had
grown
fretful
and
restive
and
undine
had
found
it
more
and
more
difficult
to
fit
his
small
exacting
personality
into
her
cramped
rooms
and
crowded
life
he
irritated
her
by
pining
for
his
aunt
laura
his
marvell
granny
and
old
dagonet
funny
stories
about
gods
and
fairies
and
his
wistful
allusions
to
his
games
with
clare
children
sounded
like
a
lesson
he
might
have
been
drilled
in
to
make
her
feel
how
little
he
belonged
to
her
but
once
released
from
paris
and
blessed
with
rabbits
a
poney
and
the
freedom
of
the
fields
he
became
again
all
that
a
charming
child
should
be
and
for
a
time
it
amused
her
to
share
in
his
romps
and
rambles
raymond
seemed
enchanted
at
the
picture
they
made
and
the
quiet
weeks
of
fresh
air
and
outdoor
activity
gave
her
back
a
bloom
that
reflected
itself
in
her
tranquillized
mood
she
was
the
more
resigned
to
this
interlude
because
she
was
so
sure
of
its
not
lasting
before
they
left
paris
a
doctor
had
been
found
to
say
that
paul
who
was
certainly
looking
pale
and
was
in
urgent
need
of
sea
air
and
undine
had
nearly
convinced
her
husband
of
the
expediency
of
hiring
a
chalet
at
deauville
for
july
and
august
when
this
plan
and
with
it
every
other
prospect
of
escape
was
dashed
by
the
sudden
death
of
the
old
marquis
undine
at
first
had
supposed
that
the
resulting
change
could
not
be
other
than
favourable
she
had
been
on
too
formal
terms
with
her
a
remote
and
ceremonious
old
gentleman
to
whom
her
own
personality
was
evidently
an
insoluble
enigma
to
feel
more
than
the
merest
conventional
pang
at
his
death
and
it
was
certainly
more
fun
to
be
a
marchioness
than
a
countess
and
to
know
that
one
husband
was
the
head
of
the
house
besides
now
they
would
have
the
chateau
to
themselves
or
at
least
the
old
marquise
when
she
came
would
be
there
as
a
guest
and
not
a
ruler
and
visions
of
smart
and
big
shoots
lit
up
the
first
weeks
of
undine
enforced
seclusion
then
by
degrees
the
inexorable
conditions
of
french
mourning
closed
in
on
her
immediately
after
the
funeral
observances
the
bereaved
family
mother
daughters
sons
and
came
down
to
seclude
themselves
at
saint
desert
and
undine
through
the
slow
hot
months
lived
encircled
by
shrouded
images
of
woe
in
which
the
only
live
points
were
the
eyes
constantly
fixed
on
her
least
movements
the
hope
of
escaping
to
the
seaside
with
paul
vanished
in
the
pained
stare
with
which
her
received
the
suggestion
undine
learned
the
next
day
that
it
had
cost
the
old
marquise
a
sleepless
night
and
might
have
had
more
distressing
results
had
it
not
been
explained
as
a
harmless
instance
of
transatlantic
oddness
raymond
entreated
his
wife
to
atone
for
her
involuntary
legereté
by
submitting
with
a
good
grace
to
the
usages
of
her
adopted
country
and
he
seemed
to
regard
the
remaining
months
of
the
summer
as
hardly
long
enough
for
this
act
of
expiation
as
undine
looked
back
on
them
they
appeared
to
have
been
composed
of
an
interminable
succession
of
identical
days
in
which
attendance
at
early
mass
in
the
coroneted
gallery
she
had
once
so
glowingly
depicted
to
van
degen
was
followed
by
a
great
deal
of
conversational
sitting
about
a
great
deal
of
excellent
eating
an
occasional
drive
to
the
nearest
town
behind
a
pair
of
heavy
draft
horses
and
long
evenings
in
a
with
all
the
windows
shut
and
the
stout
cure
making
an
asthmatic
fourth
at
the
marquise
still
even
these
conditions
were
not
permanent
and
the
discipline
of
the
last
years
had
trained
undine
to
wait
and
dissemble
the
summer
over
it
was
decided
after
a
protracted
family
conclave
that
the
state
of
the
old
marquise
health
made
it
advisable
for
her
to
spend
the
winter
with
the
married
daughter
who
lived
near
pau
the
other
members
of
the
family
returned
to
their
respective
estates
and
undine
once
more
found
herself
alone
with
her
husband
but
she
knew
by
this
time
that
there
was
to
be
no
thought
of
paris
that
winter
or
even
the
next
spring
worse
still
she
was
presently
to
discover
that
accession
of
rank
brought
with
it
no
financial
advantages
having
but
the
vaguest
notion
of
french
testamentary
law
she
was
dismayed
to
learn
that
the
compulsory
division
of
property
made
it
impossible
for
a
father
to
benefit
his
eldest
son
at
the
expense
of
the
others
raymond
was
therefore
little
richer
than
before
and
with
the
debts
of
honour
of
a
troublesome
younger
brother
to
settle
and
saint
desert
to
keep
up
his
available
income
was
actually
reduced
he
held
out
indeed
the
hope
of
eventual
improvement
since
the
old
marquis
had
managed
his
estates
with
a
lofty
contempt
for
modern
methods
and
the
application
of
new
principles
of
agriculture
and
forestry
were
certain
to
yield
profitable
results
but
for
a
year
or
two
at
any
rate
this
very
change
of
treatment
would
necessitate
the
owner
continual
supervision
and
would
not
in
the
meanwhile
produce
any
increase
of
income
to
faire
valoir
the
family
acres
had
always
it
appeared
been
purpose
and
all
his
frivolities
dropped
from
him
with
the
prospect
of
putting
his
hand
to
the
plough
he
was
not
indeed
inhuman
enough
to
condemn
his
wife
to
perpetual
exile
he
meant
he
assured
her
that
she
should
have
her
annual
spring
visit
to
paris
but
he
stared
in
dismay
at
her
suggestion
that
they
should
take
possession
of
the
coveted
premier
of
the
hotel
de
chelles
he
was
gallant
enough
to
express
the
wish
that
it
were
in
his
power
to
house
her
on
such
a
scale
but
he
could
not
conceal
his
surprise
that
she
had
ever
seriously
expected
it
she
was
beginning
to
see
that
he
felt
her
constitutional
inability
to
understand
anything
about
money
as
the
deepest
difference
between
them
it
was
a
proficiency
no
one
had
ever
expected
her
to
acquire
and
the
lack
of
which
she
had
even
been
encouraged
to
regard
as
a
grace
and
to
use
as
a
pretext
during
the
interval
between
her
divorce
and
her
remarriage
she
had
learned
what
things
cost
but
not
how
to
do
without
them
and
money
still
seemed
to
her
like
some
mysterious
and
uncertain
stream
which
occasionally
vanished
underground
but
was
sure
to
bubble
up
again
at
one
feet
now
however
she
found
herself
in
a
world
where
it
represented
not
the
means
of
individual
gratification
but
the
substance
binding
together
whole
groups
of
interests
and
where
the
uses
to
which
it
might
be
put
in
twenty
years
were
considered
before
the
reasons
for
spending
it
on
the
spot
at
first
she
was
sure
she
could
laugh
raymond
out
of
his
prudence
or
coax
him
round
to
her
point
of
view
she
did
not
understand
how
a
man
so
romantically
in
love
could
be
so
unpersuadable
on
certain
points
hitherto
she
had
had
to
contend
with
personal
moods
now
she
was
arguing
against
a
policy
and
she
was
gradually
to
learn
that
it
was
as
natural
to
raymond
de
chelles
to
adore
her
and
resist
her
as
it
had
been
to
ralph
marvell
to
adore
her
and
let
her
have
her
way
at
first
indeed
he
appealed
to
her
good
sense
using
arguments
evidently
drawn
from
accumulations
of
hereditary
experience
but
his
economic
plea
was
as
unintelligible
to
her
as
the
silly
problems
about
and
apples
in
the
mental
arithmetic
of
her
infancy
and
when
he
struck
a
tenderer
note
and
spoke
of
the
duty
of
providing
for
the
son
he
hoped
for
she
put
her
arms
about
him
to
whisper
but
then
i
ought
to
be
worried
after
that
she
noticed
though
he
was
as
charming
as
ever
he
behaved
as
if
the
case
were
closed
he
had
apparently
decided
that
his
arguments
were
unintelligible
to
her
and
under
all
his
ardour
she
felt
the
difference
made
by
the
discovery
it
did
not
make
him
less
kind
but
it
evidently
made
her
less
important
and
she
had
the
sense
that
the
day
she
ceased
to
please
him
she
would
cease
to
exist
for
him
that
day
was
a
long
way
off
of
course
but
the
chill
of
it
had
brushed
her
face
and
she
was
no
longer
heedless
of
such
signs
she
resolved
to
cultivate
all
the
arts
of
patience
and
compliance
and
habit
might
have
helped
them
to
take
root
if
they
had
not
been
nipped
by
a
new
cataclysm
it
was
barely
a
week
ago
that
her
husband
had
been
called
to
paris
to
straighten
out
a
fresh
tangle
in
the
affairs
of
the
troublesome
brother
whose
difficulties
were
apparently
a
part
of
the
family
tradition
raymond
letters
had
been
hurried
his
telegrams
brief
and
contradictory
and
now
as
undine
stood
watching
for
the
brougham
that
was
to
bring
him
from
the
station
she
had
the
sense
that
with
his
arrival
all
her
vague
fears
would
be
confirmed
there
would
be
more
money
to
pay
out
of
course
since
the
funds
that
could
not
be
found
for
her
just
needs
were
apparently
always
forthcoming
to
settle
scandalous
prodigalities
and
that
meant
a
longer
perspective
of
solitude
at
saint
desert
and
a
fresh
pretext
for
postponing
the
hospitalities
that
were
to
follow
on
their
period
of
mourning
the
brougham
a
vehicle
as
massive
and
lumbering
as
the
pair
that
drew
it
presently
rolled
into
the
court
and
raymond
sable
figure
she
had
never
before
seen
a
man
travel
in
such
black
clothes
sprang
up
the
steps
to
the
door
whenever
undine
saw
him
after
an
absence
she
had
a
curious
sense
of
his
coming
back
from
unknown
distances
and
not
belonging
to
her
or
to
any
state
of
things
she
understood
then
habit
reasserted
itself
and
she
began
to
think
of
him
again
with
a
querulous
familiarity
but
she
had
learned
to
hide
her
feelings
and
as
he
came
in
she
put
up
her
face
for
a
kiss
yes
everything
settled
his
embrace
expressed
the
satisfaction
of
the
man
returning
from
an
accomplished
task
to
the
joys
of
his
fireside
settled
her
face
kindled
without
your
having
to
pay
he
looked
at
her
with
a
shrug
of
course
i
had
to
pay
did
you
suppose
hubert
creditors
would
be
put
off
with
vanilla
eclairs
oh
if
that
what
you
mean
if
hubert
has
only
to
wire
you
at
any
time
to
be
sure
of
his
affairs
being
settled
she
saw
his
lips
narrow
and
a
line
come
out
between
his
eyes
it
be
a
happy
thought
to
tell
them
to
bring
tea
he
suggested
in
the
library
then
it
so
cold
here
and
the
tapestries
smell
so
of
rain
he
paused
a
moment
to
scrutinize
the
long
walls
on
which
the
fabulous
blues
and
pinks
of
the
great
boucher
series
looked
as
livid
as
withered
roses
i
suppose
they
ought
to
be
taken
down
and
aired
he
said
she
thought
in
this
air
much
good
it
would
do
them
but
she
had
already
repented
her
outbreak
about
hubert
and
she
followed
her
husband
into
the
library
with
the
resolve
not
to
let
him
see
her
annoyance
compared
with
the
long
grey
gallery
the
library
with
its
brown
walls
of
books
looked
warm
and
and
raymond
seemed
to
feel
the
influence
of
the
softer
atmosphere
he
turned
to
his
wife
and
put
his
arm
about
her
i
know
it
been
a
trial
to
you
dearest
but
this
is
the
last
time
i
shall
have
to
pull
the
poor
boy
out
in
spite
of
herself
she
laughed
incredulously
hubert
last
times
were
a
household
word
but
when
tea
had
been
brought
and
they
were
alone
over
the
fire
raymond
unfolded
the
amazing
sequel
hubert
had
found
an
heiress
hubert
was
to
be
married
and
henceforth
the
business
of
paying
his
debts
which
might
be
counted
on
to
recur
as
inevitably
as
the
changes
of
the
seasons
would
devolve
on
his
american
bride
the
charming
miss
looty
arlington
whom
raymond
had
remained
over
in
paris
to
meet
an
american
he
marrying
an
american
undine
wavered
between
wrath
and
satisfaction
she
felt
a
flash
of
resentment
at
any
other
venturing
upon
her
territory
looty
arlington
who
is
she
what
a
name
but
it
was
quickly
superseded
by
the
relief
of
knowing
that
henceforth
as
raymond
said
hubert
debts
would
be
some
one
business
then
a
third
consideration
prevailed
but
if
he
engaged
to
a
rich
girl
why
on
earth
do
we
have
to
pull
him
out
her
husband
explained
that
no
other
course
was
possible
though
general
arlington
was
immensely
wealthy
her
father
a
general
a
general
manager
whatever
that
may
be
he
had
exacted
what
he
called
a
clean
slate
from
his
future
and
hubert
creditors
the
boy
was
such
a
donkey
had
in
their
possession
certain
papers
that
made
it
possible
for
them
to
press
for
immediate
payment
your
compatriots
views
on
such
matters
are
so
rigid
and
it
all
to
their
credit
that
the
marriage
would
have
fallen
through
at
once
if
the
least
hint
of
hubert
mess
had
got
out
and
then
we
should
have
had
him
on
our
hands
for
life
yes
from
that
point
of
view
it
was
doubtless
best
to
pay
up
but
undine
obscurely
wished
that
their
doing
so
had
not
incidentally
helped
an
unknown
compatriot
to
what
the
american
papers
were
no
doubt
already
announcing
as
another
brilliant
foreign
alliance
where
on
earth
did
your
brother
pick
up
anybody
respectable
do
you
know
where
her
people
come
from
i
suppose
she
perfectly
awful
she
broke
out
with
a
sudden
escape
of
irritation
i
believe
hubert
made
her
acquaintance
at
a
skating
rink
they
come
from
some
new
state
the
general
apologized
for
its
not
yet
being
on
the
map
but
seemed
surprised
i
had
heard
of
it
he
said
it
was
already
known
as
one
of
divorce
states
and
the
principal
city
had
in
consequence
a
very
agreeable
society
la
petite
vraiment
pas
trop
mal
i
daresay
not
we
all
but
she
must
be
horribly
common
raymond
seemed
sincerely
unable
to
formulate
a
judgment
my
dear
you
have
your
own
customs
oh
i
know
we
all
alike
to
you
it
was
one
of
her
grievances
that
he
never
attempted
to
discriminate
between
americans
you
see
no
difference
between
me
and
a
girl
one
gets
engaged
to
at
a
skating
rink
he
evaded
the
challenge
by
rejoining
miss
arlington
burning
to
know
you
she
says
she
heard
a
great
deal
about
you
and
hubert
wants
to
bring
her
down
next
week
i
think
we
better
do
what
we
can
of
course
but
undine
was
still
absorbed
in
the
economic
aspect
of
the
case
if
they
as
rich
as
you
say
i
suppose
hubert
means
to
pay
you
back
by
and
bye
naturally
it
all
arranged
he
given
me
a
paper
he
drew
her
hands
into
his
you
see
we
every
reason
to
be
kind
to
miss
arlington
oh
i
be
as
kind
as
you
like
she
brightened
at
the
prospect
of
repayment
yes
they
would
ask
the
girl
down
she
leaned
a
little
nearer
to
her
husband
but
then
after
a
while
we
shall
be
a
good
deal
better
off
especially
as
you
say
with
no
more
of
hubert
debts
to
worry
us
and
leaning
back
far
enough
to
give
her
upward
smile
she
renewed
her
plea
for
the
premier
in
the
hotel
de
chelles
because
really
you
know
as
the
head
of
the
house
you
ought
to
ah
my
dear
as
the
head
of
the
house
i
so
many
obligations
and
one
of
them
is
not
to
miss
a
good
stroke
of
business
when
it
comes
my
way
her
hands
slipped
from
his
shoulders
and
she
drew
back
what
do
you
mean
by
a
good
stroke
of
business
why
an
incredible
piece
of
luck
it
what
kept
me
on
so
long
in
paris
miss
arlington
father
was
looking
for
an
apartment
for
the
young
couple
and
i
let
him
the
premier
for
twelve
years
on
the
understanding
that
he
puts
electric
light
and
heating
into
the
whole
hotel
it
a
wonderful
chance
for
of
course
we
all
benefit
by
it
as
much
as
hubert
a
wonderful
chance
benefit
by
it
as
much
as
hubert
he
seemed
to
be
speaking
a
strange
language
in
which
syllables
meant
something
totally
unknown
did
he
really
think
she
was
going
to
coop
herself
up
again
in
their
cramped
quarters
while
hubert
and
his
bride
luxuriated
overhead
in
the
coveted
premier
all
the
resentments
that
had
been
accumulating
in
her
during
the
long
baffled
months
since
her
marriage
broke
into
speech
it
extraordinary
of
you
to
do
such
a
thing
without
consulting
me
without
consulting
you
but
my
dear
child
you
always
professed
the
most
complete
indifference
to
business
matters
you
frequently
begged
me
not
to
bore
you
with
them
you
may
be
sure
i
acted
on
the
best
advice
and
my
mother
whose
head
is
as
good
as
a
man
thinks
made
a
remarkably
good
arrangement
i
daresay
but
i
not
always
thinking
about
money
as
you
are
as
she
spoke
she
had
an
ominous
sense
of
impending
peril
but
she
was
too
angry
to
avoid
even
the
risks
she
saw
to
her
surprise
raymond
put
his
arm
about
her
with
a
smile
there
are
many
reasons
why
i
have
to
think
about
money
one
is
that
you
do
and
another
is
that
i
must
look
out
for
the
future
of
our
son
undine
flushed
to
the
forehead
she
had
grown
accustomed
to
such
allusions
and
the
thought
of
having
a
child
no
longer
filled
her
with
the
resentful
terror
she
had
felt
before
paul
birth
she
had
been
insensibly
influenced
by
a
different
point
of
view
perhaps
also
by
a
difference
in
her
own
feeling
and
the
vision
of
herself
as
the
mother
of
the
future
marquis
de
chelles
was
softened
to
happiness
by
the
thought
of
giving
raymond
a
son
but
all
these
sentiments
went
down
in
the
rush
of
her
resentment
and
she
freed
herself
with
a
petulant
movement
oh
my
dear
you
better
leave
it
to
your
brother
to
perpetuate
the
race
there
be
more
room
for
nurseries
in
their
apartment
she
waited
a
moment
quivering
with
the
expectation
of
her
answer
then
as
none
came
except
the
silent
darkening
of
his
face
she
walked
to
the
door
and
turned
round
to
fling
back
of
course
you
can
do
what
you
like
with
your
own
house
and
make
any
arrangements
that
suit
your
family
without
consulting
me
but
you
need
think
i
ever
going
back
to
live
in
that
stuffy
little
hole
with
hubert
and
his
wife
splurging
round
on
top
of
our
heads
ah
said
raymond
de
chelles
in
a
low
voice
xxxix
undine
did
not
fulfil
her
threat
the
month
of
may
saw
her
back
in
the
rooms
she
had
declared
she
would
never
set
foot
in
and
after
her
long
sojourn
among
the
echoing
vistas
of
saint
desert
the
exiguity
of
her
paris
quarters
seemed
like
cosiness
in
the
interval
many
things
had
happened
hubert
permitted
by
his
anxious
relatives
to
anticipate
the
term
of
the
family
mourning
had
been
showily
and
expensively
united
to
his
heiress
the
hotel
de
chelles
had
been
piped
heated
and
illuminated
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
and
the
young
couple
not
content
with
these
utilitarian
changes
had
moved
doors
opened
windows
torn
down
partitions
and
given
over
the
great
trophied
and
pilastered
to
a
decorative
painter
with
a
new
theory
of
the
human
anatomy
undine
had
silently
assisted
at
this
spectacle
and
at
the
sight
of
the
old
abject
acquiescence
she
had
seen
the
duchesse
de
dordogne
and
the
princesse
estradina
go
past
her
door
to
visit
hubert
premier
and
marvel
at
the
american
and
the
annamite
and
she
had
been
present
with
her
husband
at
the
banquet
at
which
hubert
had
revealed
to
the
astonished
faubourg
the
prehistoric
episodes
depicted
on
his
walls
she
had
accepted
all
these
necessities
with
the
stoicism
which
the
last
months
had
developed
in
her
for
more
and
more
as
the
days
passed
she
felt
herself
in
the
grasp
of
circumstances
stronger
than
any
effort
she
could
oppose
to
them
the
very
absence
of
external
pressure
of
any
tactless
assertion
of
authority
on
her
husband
part
intensified
the
sense
of
her
helplessness
he
simply
left
it
to
her
to
infer
that
important
as
she
might
be
to
him
in
certain
ways
there
were
others
in
which
she
did
not
weigh
a
feather
their
outward
relations
had
not
changed
since
her
outburst
on
the
subject
of
hubert
marriage
that
incident
had
left
her
at
her
behaviour
and
she
had
tried
to
atone
for
it
by
the
indirect
arts
that
were
her
nearest
approach
to
acknowledging
herself
in
the
wrong
raymond
met
her
advances
with
a
good
grace
and
they
lived
through
the
rest
of
the
winter
on
terms
of
apparent
understanding
when
the
spring
approached
it
was
he
who
suggested
that
since
his
mother
had
consented
to
hubert
marrying
before
the
year
of
mourning
was
over
there
was
really
no
reason
why
they
should
not
go
up
to
paris
as
usual
and
she
was
surprised
at
the
readiness
with
which
he
prepared
to
accompany
her
a
year
earlier
she
would
have
regarded
this
as
another
proof
of
her
power
but
she
now
drew
her
inferences
less
quickly
raymond
was
as
lovely
to
her
as
ever
but
more
than
once
during
their
months
in
the
country
she
had
had
a
startled
sense
of
not
giving
him
all
he
expected
of
her
she
had
admired
him
before
their
marriage
as
a
model
of
social
distinction
during
the
honeymoon
he
had
been
the
most
ardent
of
lovers
and
with
their
settling
down
at
saint
desert
she
had
prepared
to
resign
herself
to
the
society
of
a
country
gentleman
absorbed
in
sport
and
agriculture
but
raymond
to
her
surprise
had
again
developed
a
disturbing
resemblance
to
his
predecessor
during
the
long
winter
afternoons
after
he
had
gone
over
his
accounts
with
the
bailiff
or
written
his
business
letters
he
took
to
dabbling
with
a
or
picking
out
new
scores
at
the
piano
after
dinner
when
they
went
to
the
library
he
seemed
to
expect
to
read
aloud
to
her
from
the
reviews
and
papers
he
was
always
receiving
and
when
he
had
discovered
her
inability
to
fix
her
attention
he
fell
into
the
way
of
absorbing
himself
in
one
of
the
old
brown
books
with
which
the
room
was
lined
at
first
he
tried
as
ralph
had
done
to
tell
her
about
what
he
was
reading
or
what
was
happening
in
the
world
but
her
sense
of
inadequacy
made
her
slip
away
to
other
subjects
and
little
by
little
their
talk
died
down
to
monosyllables
was
it
possible
that
in
spite
of
his
books
the
evenings
seemed
as
long
to
raymond
as
to
her
and
that
he
had
suggested
going
back
to
paris
because
he
was
bored
at
saint
desert
bored
as
she
was
herself
she
resented
his
not
finding
her
company
and
was
mortified
by
the
discovery
that
there
were
regions
of
his
life
she
could
not
enter
but
once
back
in
paris
she
had
less
time
for
introspection
and
raymond
less
for
books
they
resumed
their
dispersed
and
busy
life
and
in
spite
of
hubert
ostentatious
vicinity
of
the
perpetual
lack
of
money
and
of
paul
innocent
encroachments
on
her
freedom
undine
once
more
in
her
element
ceased
to
brood
upon
her
grievances
she
enjoyed
going
about
with
her
husband
whose
presence
at
her
side
was
distinctly
ornamental
he
seemed
to
have
grown
suddenly
younger
and
more
animated
and
when
she
saw
other
women
looking
at
him
she
remembered
how
distinguished
he
was
it
amused
her
to
have
him
in
her
train
and
driving
about
with
him
to
dinners
and
dances
waiting
for
him
on
landings
or
pushing
at
his
side
through
blazing
answered
to
her
inmost
ideal
of
domestic
intimacy
he
seemed
disposed
to
allow
her
more
liberty
than
before
and
it
was
only
now
and
then
that
he
let
drop
a
brief
reminder
of
the
conditions
on
which
it
was
accorded
she
was
to
keep
certain
people
at
a
distance
she
was
not
to
cheapen
herself
by
being
seen
at
vulgar
restaurants
and
she
was
to
join
with
him
in
fulfilling
certain
family
obligations
going
to
a
good
many
dull
dinners
among
the
number
but
in
other
respects
she
was
free
to
fill
her
days
as
she
pleased
not
that
it
leaves
me
much
time
she
admitted
to
madame
de
trezac
what
with
going
to
see
his
mother
every
day
and
never
missing
one
of
his
sisters
jours
and
showing
myself
at
the
hotel
de
dordogne
whenever
the
duchess
gives
a
party
to
the
stuffy
people
lili
estradina
wo
be
bothered
with
there
are
days
when
i
never
lay
eyes
on
paul
and
barely
have
time
to
be
waved
and
manicured
but
apart
from
that
raymond
really
much
nicer
and
less
fussy
than
he
was
undine
as
she
grew
older
had
developed
her
mother
craving
for
a
confidante
and
madame
de
trezac
had
succeeded
in
that
capacity
to
mabel
lipscomb
and
bertha
shallum
less
fussy
madame
de
trezac
long
nose
lengthened
thoughtfully
h
are
you
sure
that
a
good
sign
undine
stared
and
laughed
oh
my
dear
you
so
quaint
why
jealous
any
more
no
that
the
worst
of
it
madame
de
trezac
pondered
it
a
thousand
pities
you
have
got
a
son
yes
i
wish
we
had
undine
stood
up
impatient
to
end
the
conversation
since
she
had
learned
that
her
continued
childlessness
was
regarded
by
every
one
about
her
as
not
only
unfortunate
but
somehow
vaguely
derogatory
to
her
she
had
genuinely
begun
to
regret
it
and
any
allusion
to
the
subject
disturbed
her
especially
madame
de
trezac
continued
as
hubert
wife
oh
if
that
all
they
want
it
a
pity
raymond
did
marry
wife
undine
flung
back
and
on
the
stairs
she
murmured
to
herself
nettie
has
been
talking
to
my
but
this
explanation
did
not
quiet
her
and
that
evening
as
she
and
raymond
drove
back
together
from
a
party
she
felt
a
sudden
impulse
to
speak
sitting
close
to
him
in
the
darkness
of
the
carriage
it
ought
to
have
been
easy
for
her
to
find
the
needed
word
but
the
barrier
of
his
indifference
hung
between
them
and
street
after
street
slipped
by
and
the
spangled
blackness
of
the
river
unrolled
itself
beneath
their
wheels
before
she
leaned
over
to
touch
his
hand
what
is
it
my
dear
she
had
not
yet
found
the
word
and
already
his
tone
told
her
she
was
too
late
a
year
ago
if
she
had
slipped
her
hand
in
his
she
would
not
have
had
that
answer
your
mother
blames
me
for
our
not
having
a
child
everybody
thinks
my
fault
he
paused
before
answering
and
she
sat
watching
his
shadowy
profile
against
the
passing
lamps
my
mother
ideas
are
and
i
do
know
that
anybody
business
but
yours
and
mine
yes
but
here
we
are
the
brougham
was
turning
under
the
archway
of
the
hotel
and
the
light
of
hubert
tall
windows
fell
across
the
dusky
court
raymond
helped
her
out
and
they
mounted
to
their
door
by
the
stairs
which
hubert
had
recarpeted
in
velvet
with
a
marble
nymph
lurking
in
the
azaleas
on
the
landing
in
the
antechamber
raymond
paused
to
take
her
cloak
from
her
shoulders
and
his
eyes
rested
on
her
with
a
faint
smile
of
approval
you
never
looked
better
your
dress
is
extremely
becoming
my
dear
he
said
kissing
her
hand
as
he
turned
away
undine
kept
this
incident
to
herself
her
wounded
pride
made
her
shrink
from
confessing
it
even
to
madame
de
trezac
she
was
sure
raymond
would
come
back
ralph
always
had
to
the
last
during
their
remaining
weeks
in
paris
she
reassured
herself
with
the
thought
that
once
they
were
back
at
saint
desert
she
would
easily
regain
her
lost
hold
and
when
raymond
suggested
their
leaving
paris
she
acquiesced
without
a
protest
but
at
saint
desert
she
seemed
no
nearer
to
him
than
in
paris
he
continued
to
treat
her
with
unvarying
amiability
but
he
seemed
wholly
absorbed
in
the
management
of
the
estate
in
his
books
his
sketching
and
his
music
he
had
begun
to
interest
himself
in
politics
and
had
been
urged
to
stand
for
his
department
this
necessitated
frequent
displacements
trips
to
beaune
or
dijon
and
occasional
absences
in
paris
undine
when
he
was
away
was
not
left
alone
for
the
dowager
marquise
had
established
herself
at
saint
desert
for
the
summer
and
relays
of
brothers
and
aunts
cousins
and
ecclesiastical
friends
and
connections
succeeded
each
other
under
its
capacious
roof
only
hubert
and
his
wife
were
absent
they
had
taken
a
villa
at
deauville
and
in
the
morning
papers
undine
followed
the
chronicle
of
hubert
polo
scores
and
of
the
countess
hubert
racing
toilets
the
days
crawled
on
with
a
benumbing
sameness
the
old
marquise
and
the
other
ladies
of
the
party
sat
on
the
terrace
with
their
the
cure
or
one
of
the
visiting
uncles
read
aloud
the
journal
des
debats
and
prognosticated
dark
things
of
the
republic
paul
scoured
the
park
and
despoiled
the
with
the
other
children
of
the
family
the
inhabitants
of
the
adjacent
chateaux
drove
over
to
call
and
occasionally
the
ponderous
pair
were
harnessed
to
a
landau
as
lumbering
as
the
brougham
and
the
ladies
of
saint
desert
measured
the
dusty
kilometres
between
themselves
and
their
neighbours
it
was
the
first
time
that
undine
had
seriously
paused
to
consider
the
conditions
of
her
new
life
and
as
the
days
passed
she
began
to
understand
that
so
they
would
continue
to
succeed
each
other
till
the
end
every
one
about
her
took
it
for
granted
that
as
long
as
she
lived
she
would
spend
ten
months
of
every
year
at
saint
desert
and
the
remaining
two
in
paris
of
course
if
health
required
it
she
might
go
to
les
eaux
with
her
husband
but
the
old
marquise
was
very
doubtful
as
to
the
benefit
of
a
course
of
waters
and
her
uncle
the
duke
and
her
cousin
the
canon
shared
her
view
in
the
case
of
young
married
women
especially
the
unwholesome
excitement
of
the
modern
was
more
than
likely
to
do
away
with
the
possible
benefit
of
the
treatment
as
to
travel
had
not
raymond
and
his
wife
been
to
egypt
and
asia
minor
on
their
such
reckless
enterprise
was
unheard
of
in
the
annals
of
the
house
had
they
not
spent
days
and
days
in
the
saddle
and
slept
in
tents
among
the
arabs
who
could
tell
indeed
whether
these
imprudences
were
not
the
cause
of
the
disappointment
which
it
had
pleased
heaven
to
inflict
on
the
young
couple
no
one
in
the
family
had
ever
taken
so
long
a
one
bride
had
gone
to
england
even
that
was
considered
extreme
and
another
the
artistic
daughter
had
spent
a
week
in
venice
which
certainly
showed
that
they
were
not
behind
the
times
and
had
no
prejudices
since
were
the
fashion
they
had
taken
them
but
who
had
ever
heard
of
travelling
afterward
what
could
be
the
possible
object
of
leaving
one
family
one
habits
one
friends
it
was
natural
that
the
americans
who
had
no
homes
who
were
born
and
died
in
hotels
should
have
contracted
nomadic
habits
but
the
new
marquise
de
chelles
was
no
longer
an
american
and
she
had
saint
desert
and
the
hotel
de
chelles
to
live
in
as
generations
of
ladies
of
her
name
had
done
before
her
thus
undine
beheld
her
future
laid
out
for
her
not
directly
and
in
blunt
words
but
obliquely
and
affably
in
the
allusions
the
assumptions
the
insinuations
of
the
amiable
women
among
whom
her
days
were
spent
their
interminable
conversations
were
carried
on
to
the
click
of
and
the
rise
and
fall
of
industrious
fingers
above
and
as
undine
sat
staring
at
the
lustrous
nails
of
her
idle
hands
she
felt
that
her
inability
to
occupy
them
was
regarded
as
one
of
the
chief
causes
of
her
restlessness
the
innumerable
rooms
of
saint
desert
were
furnished
with
the
embroidered
hangings
and
tapestry
chairs
produced
by
generations
of
diligent
chatelaines
and
the
untiring
needles
of
the
old
marquise
her
daughters
and
dependents
were
still
steadily
increasing
the
provision
it
struck
undine
as
curious
that
they
should
be
willing
to
go
on
making
and
for
a
house
that
did
really
belong
to
them
and
that
she
had
a
right
to
pull
about
and
rearrange
as
she
chose
but
then
that
was
only
a
part
of
their
whole
incomprehensible
way
of
regarding
themselves
in
spite
of
their
acute
personal
and
parochial
absorptions
as
minor
members
of
a
powerful
and
indivisible
whole
the
huge
voracious
fetish
they
called
the
family
notwithstanding
their
very
definite
theories
as
to
what
americans
were
and
were
not
they
were
evidently
bewildered
at
finding
no
corresponding
sense
of
solidarity
in
undine
and
little
paul
rootlessness
his
lack
of
all
local
and
linear
ties
made
them
for
all
the
charm
he
exercised
regard
him
with
something
of
the
shyness
of
pious
christians
toward
an
elfin
child
but
though
mother
and
child
gave
them
a
sense
of
insuperable
strangeness
it
plainly
never
occurred
to
them
that
both
would
not
be
gradually
subdued
to
the
customs
of
saint
desert
dynasties
had
fallen
institutions
changed
manners
and
morals
alas
deplorably
declined
but
as
far
back
as
memory
went
the
ladies
of
the
line
of
chelles
had
always
sat
at
their
on
the
terrace
of
saint
desert
while
the
men
of
the
house
lamented
the
corruption
of
the
government
and
the
cure
ascribed
the
unhappy
state
of
the
country
to
the
decline
of
religious
feeling
and
the
rise
in
the
cost
of
living
it
was
inevitable
that
in
the
course
of
time
the
new
marquise
should
come
to
understand
the
fundamental
necessity
of
these
things
being
as
they
were
and
meanwhile
the
forbearance
of
her
husband
family
exercised
itself
with
the
smiling
discretion
of
their
race
through
the
long
succession
of
uneventful
days
once
in
september
this
routine
was
broken
in
upon
by
the
unannounced
descent
of
a
flock
of
motors
bearing
the
princess
estradina
and
a
chosen
band
from
one
to
another
raymond
was
away
at
the
time
but
family
loyalty
constrained
the
old
marquise
to
welcome
her
kinswoman
and
the
latter
friends
and
undine
once
more
found
herself
immersed
in
the
world
from
which
her
marriage
had
removed
her
the
princess
at
first
seemed
totally
to
have
forgotten
their
former
intimacy
and
undine
was
made
to
feel
that
in
a
life
so
variously
agitated
the
episode
could
hardly
have
left
a
trace
but
the
night
before
her
departure
the
incalculable
lili
with
one
of
her
sudden
changes
of
humour
drew
her
former
friend
into
her
bedroom
and
plunged
into
an
exchange
of
confidences
she
naturally
unfolded
her
own
history
first
and
it
was
so
packed
with
incident
that
the
courtyard
clock
had
struck
two
before
she
turned
her
attention
to
undine
my
dear
you
handsomer
than
ever
only
perhaps
a
shade
too
stout
domestic
bliss
i
suppose
take
care
you
need
an
emotion
a
drama
you
americans
are
really
extraordinary
you
appear
to
live
on
change
and
excitement
and
then
suddenly
a
man
comes
along
and
claps
a
ring
on
your
finger
and
you
never
look
through
it
to
see
what
going
on
outside
are
you
ever
the
least
bit
bored
why
do
i
never
see
anything
of
you
any
more
i
suppose
it
the
fault
of
my
venerable
aunt
she
never
forgiven
me
for
having
a
better
time
than
her
daughters
how
can
i
help
it
if
i
do
look
like
the
cure
umbrella
i
daresay
she
owes
you
the
same
grudge
but
why
do
you
let
her
coop
you
up
here
it
a
thousand
pities
you
have
had
a
child
they
all
treat
you
differently
if
you
had
it
was
the
same
perpetually
reiterated
condolence
and
undine
flushed
with
anger
as
she
listened
why
indeed
had
she
let
herself
be
cooped
up
she
could
not
have
answered
the
princess
question
she
merely
felt
the
impossibility
of
breaking
through
the
mysterious
web
of
traditions
conventions
prohibitions
that
enclosed
her
in
their
impenetrable
but
her
vanity
suggested
the
obvious
pretext
and
she
murmured
with
a
laugh
i
did
know
raymond
was
going
to
be
so
jealous
the
princess
stared
is
it
raymond
who
keeps
you
shut
up
here
and
what
about
his
trips
to
dijon
and
what
do
you
suppose
he
does
with
himself
when
he
runs
up
to
paris
politics
she
shrugged
ironically
politics
do
occupy
a
man
after
midnight
raymond
jealous
of
you
ah
merci
my
dear
it
what
i
always
say
when
people
talk
to
me
about
fast
americans
you
the
only
innocent
women
left
in
the
world
xl
after
the
princess
estradina
departure
the
days
at
saint
desert
succeeded
each
other
indistinguishably
and
more
and
more
as
they
passed
undine
felt
herself
drawn
into
the
slow
strong
current
already
fed
by
so
many
tributary
lives
some
spell
she
could
not
have
named
seemed
to
emanate
from
the
old
house
which
had
so
long
been
the
custodian
of
an
unbroken
tradition
things
had
happened
there
in
the
same
way
for
so
many
generations
that
to
try
to
alter
them
seemed
as
vain
as
to
contend
with
the
elements
winter
came
and
went
and
once
more
the
calendar
marked
the
first
days
of
spring
but
though
the
of
the
champs
elysees
were
budding
snow
still
lingered
in
the
grass
drives
of
saint
desert
and
along
the
ridges
of
the
hills
beyond
the
park
sometimes
as
undine
looked
out
of
the
windows
of
the
boucher
gallery
she
felt
as
if
her
eyes
had
never
rested
on
any
other
scene
even
her
occasional
brief
trips
to
paris
left
no
lasting
trace
the
life
of
the
vivid
streets
faded
to
a
shadow
as
soon
as
the
black
and
white
horizon
of
saint
desert
closed
in
on
her
again
though
the
afternoons
were
still
cold
she
had
lately
taken
to
sitting
in
the
gallery
the
smiling
scenes
on
its
walls
and
the
tall
screens
which
broke
its
length
made
it
more
habitable
than
the
beyond
but
her
chief
reason
for
preferring
it
was
the
satisfaction
she
found
in
having
fires
lit
in
both
the
monumental
chimneys
that
faced
each
other
down
its
long
perspective
this
satisfaction
had
its
source
in
the
old
marquise
disapproval
never
before
in
the
history
of
saint
desert
had
the
consumption
of
firewood
exceeded
a
certain
measure
but
since
undine
had
been
in
authority
this
allowance
had
been
doubled
if
any
one
had
told
her
a
year
earlier
that
one
of
the
chief
distractions
of
her
new
life
would
be
to
invent
ways
of
annoying
her
she
would
have
laughed
at
the
idea
of
wasting
her
time
on
such
trifles
but
she
found
herself
with
a
great
deal
of
time
to
waste
and
with
a
fierce
desire
to
spend
it
in
upsetting
the
immemorial
customs
of
saint
desert
her
husband
had
mastered
her
in
essentials
but
she
had
discovered
innumerable
small
ways
of
irritating
and
hurting
him
and
one
and
not
the
least
effectual
was
to
do
anything
that
went
counter
to
his
mother
prejudices
it
was
not
that
he
always
shared
her
views
or
was
a
particularly
subservient
son
but
it
seemed
to
be
one
of
his
fundamental
principles
that
a
man
should
respect
his
mother
wishes
and
see
to
it
that
his
household
respected
them
all
frenchmen
of
his
class
appeared
to
share
this
view
and
to
regard
it
as
beyond
discussion
it
was
based
on
something
so
much
more
immutable
than
personal
feeling
that
one
might
even
hate
one
mother
and
yet
insist
that
her
ideas
as
to
the
consumption
of
should
be
regarded
the
old
marquise
during
the
cold
weather
always
sat
in
her
bedroom
and
there
between
the
tapestried
and
the
fireplace
the
family
grouped
itself
around
the
of
her
single
carcel
lamp
in
the
evening
if
there
were
visitors
a
fire
was
lit
in
the
library
otherwise
the
family
again
sat
about
the
marquise
lamp
till
the
footman
came
in
at
ten
with
tisane
and
biscuits
de
reims
after
which
every
one
bade
the
dowager
good
night
and
scattered
down
the
corridors
to
chill
distances
marked
by
tapers
floating
in
cups
of
oil
since
undine
coming
the
library
fire
had
never
been
allowed
to
go
out
and
of
late
after
experimenting
with
the
two
and
the
study
where
raymond
kept
his
guns
and
saw
the
bailiff
she
had
selected
the
gallery
as
the
most
suitable
place
for
the
new
and
unfamiliar
ceremony
of
afternoon
tea
afternoon
refreshments
had
never
before
been
served
at
saint
desert
except
when
company
was
expected
when
they
had
invariably
consisted
in
a
decanter
of
sweet
port
and
a
plate
of
small
dry
cakes
the
kind
that
kept
that
the
complicated
rites
of
the
with
its
of
perishable
delicacies
should
be
enacted
for
the
sole
enjoyment
of
the
family
was
a
thing
so
unheard
of
that
for
a
while
undine
found
sufficient
amusement
in
elaborating
the
ceremonial
and
in
making
the
ancestral
plate
groan
under
more
varied
viands
and
when
this
palled
she
devised
the
plan
of
performing
the
office
in
the
gallery
and
lighting
sacrificial
fires
in
both
chimneys
she
had
said
to
raymond
at
first
it
ridiculous
that
your
mother
should
sit
in
her
bedroom
all
day
she
says
she
does
it
to
save
fires
but
if
we
have
a
fire
downstairs
why
ca
she
let
hers
go
out
and
come
down
i
do
see
why
i
should
spend
my
life
in
your
mother
bedroom
raymond
made
no
answer
and
the
marquise
did
in
fact
let
her
fire
go
out
but
she
did
not
come
down
she
simply
continued
to
sit
upstairs
without
a
fire
at
first
this
also
amused
undine
then
the
tacit
criticism
implied
began
to
irritate
her
she
hoped
raymond
would
speak
of
his
mother
attitude
she
had
her
answer
ready
if
he
did
but
he
made
no
comment
he
took
no
notice
her
impulses
of
retaliation
spent
themselves
against
the
blank
surface
of
his
indifference
he
was
as
amiable
as
considerate
as
ever
as
ready
within
reason
to
accede
to
her
wishes
and
gratify
her
whims
once
or
twice
when
she
suggested
running
up
to
paris
to
take
paul
to
the
dentist
or
to
look
for
a
servant
he
agreed
to
the
necessity
and
went
up
with
her
but
instead
of
going
to
an
hotel
they
went
to
their
apartment
where
carpets
were
up
and
curtains
down
and
a
prepared
primitive
food
at
uncertain
hours
and
undine
first
glimpse
of
hubert
illuminated
windows
deepened
her
rancour
and
her
sense
of
helplessness
as
madame
de
trezac
had
predicted
raymond
vigilance
gradually
relaxed
and
during
their
excursions
to
the
capital
undine
came
and
went
as
she
pleased
but
her
visits
were
too
short
to
permit
of
her
falling
in
with
the
social
pace
and
when
she
showed
herself
among
her
friends
she
felt
countrified
and
as
if
even
her
clothes
had
come
from
saint
desert
nevertheless
her
dresses
were
more
than
ever
her
chief
preoccupation
in
paris
she
spent
hours
at
the
dressmaker
and
in
the
country
the
arrival
of
a
box
of
new
gowns
was
the
chief
event
of
the
vacant
days
but
there
was
more
bitterness
than
joy
in
the
unpacking
and
the
dresses
hung
in
her
wardrobe
like
so
many
unfulfilled
promises
of
pleasure
reminding
her
of
the
days
at
the
stentorian
when
she
had
reviewed
other
finery
with
the
same
cheated
eyes
in
spite
of
this
she
multiplied
her
orders
writing
up
to
the
for
patterns
and
to
the
milliners
for
boxes
of
hats
which
she
tried
on
and
kept
for
days
without
being
able
to
make
a
choice
now
and
then
she
even
sent
her
maid
up
to
paris
to
bring
back
great
assortments
of
veils
gloves
flowers
and
laces
and
after
periods
of
painful
indecision
she
ended
by
keeping
the
greater
number
lest
those
she
sent
back
should
turn
out
to
be
the
ones
that
were
worn
in
paris
she
knew
she
was
spending
too
much
money
and
she
had
lost
her
youthful
faith
in
providential
solutions
but
she
had
always
had
the
habit
of
going
out
to
buy
something
when
she
was
bored
and
never
had
she
been
in
greater
need
of
such
solace
the
dulness
of
her
life
seemed
to
have
passed
into
her
blood
her
complexion
was
less
animated
her
hair
less
shining
the
change
in
her
looks
alarmed
her
and
she
scanned
the
for
new
scents
and
powders
and
experimented
in
facial
bandaging
electric
massage
and
other
processes
of
renovation
odd
atavisms
woke
in
her
and
she
began
to
pore
over
patent
medicine
advertisements
to
send
stamped
envelopes
to
beauty
doctors
and
professors
of
physical
development
and
to
brood
on
the
advantage
of
consulting
and
their
kindred
adepts
she
even
wrote
to
her
mother
for
the
receipts
of
some
of
her
grandfather
forgotten
nostrums
and
modified
her
daily
life
and
her
hours
of
sleeping
eating
and
exercise
in
accordance
with
each
new
experiment
her
constitutional
restlessness
lapsed
into
an
apathy
like
spragg
and
the
least
demand
on
her
activity
irritated
her
but
she
was
beset
by
endless
annoyances
bickerings
with
discontented
maids
the
difficulty
of
finding
a
tutor
for
paul
and
the
problem
of
keeping
him
amused
and
occupied
without
having
him
too
much
on
her
hands
a
great
liking
had
sprung
up
between
raymond
and
the
little
boy
and
during
the
summer
paul
was
perpetually
at
his
side
in
the
stables
and
the
park
but
with
the
coming
of
winter
raymond
was
oftener
away
and
paul
developed
a
persistent
cold
that
kept
him
frequently
indoors
the
confinement
made
him
fretful
and
exacting
and
the
old
marquise
ascribed
the
change
in
his
behaviour
to
the
deplorable
influence
of
his
tutor
a
laic
recommended
by
one
of
raymond
old
professors
raymond
himself
would
have
preferred
an
abbé
it
was
in
the
tradition
of
the
house
and
though
paul
was
not
of
the
house
it
seemed
fitting
that
he
should
conform
to
its
ways
moreover
when
the
married
sisters
came
to
stay
they
objected
to
having
their
children
exposed
to
the
tutor
influence
and
even
implied
that
paul
society
might
be
contaminating
but
undine
though
she
had
so
readily
embraced
her
husband
faith
stubbornly
resisted
the
suggestion
that
she
should
hand
over
her
son
to
the
church
the
tutor
therefore
remained
but
the
friction
caused
by
his
presence
was
so
irritating
to
undine
that
she
began
to
consider
the
alternative
of
sending
paul
to
school
he
was
still
small
and
tender
for
the
experiment
but
she
persuaded
herself
that
what
he
needed
was
hardening
and
having
heard
of
a
school
where
fashionable
infancy
was
subjected
to
this
process
she
entered
into
correspondence
with
the
master
his
first
letter
convinced
her
that
his
establishment
was
just
the
place
for
paul
but
the
second
contained
the
and
after
comparing
it
with
the
tutor
keep
and
salary
she
wrote
to
say
that
she
feared
her
little
boy
was
too
young
to
be
sent
away
from
home
her
husband
for
some
time
past
had
ceased
to
make
any
comment
on
her
expenditure
she
knew
he
thought
her
too
extravagant
and
felt
sure
he
was
minutely
aware
of
what
she
spent
for
saint
desert
projected
on
economic
details
a
light
as
different
as
might
be
from
the
haze
that
veiled
them
in
west
end
avenue
she
therefore
concluded
that
silence
was
intentional
and
ascribed
it
to
his
having
shortcomings
of
his
own
to
conceal
the
princess
estradina
pleasantry
had
reached
its
mark
undine
did
not
believe
that
her
husband
was
seriously
in
love
with
another
woman
she
could
not
conceive
that
any
one
could
tire
of
her
of
whom
she
had
not
first
tired
but
she
was
humiliated
by
his
indifference
and
it
was
easier
to
ascribe
it
to
the
arts
of
a
rival
than
to
any
deficiency
in
herself
it
exasperated
her
to
think
that
he
might
have
consolations
for
the
outward
monotony
of
his
life
and
she
resolved
that
when
they
returned
to
paris
he
should
see
that
she
was
not
without
similar
opportunities
march
meanwhile
was
verging
on
april
and
still
he
did
not
speak
of
leaving
undine
had
learned
that
he
expected
to
have
such
decisions
left
to
him
and
she
hid
her
impatience
lest
her
showing
it
should
incline
him
to
delay
but
one
day
as
she
sat
at
tea
in
the
gallery
he
came
in
in
his
and
said
i
been
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
the
february
rains
have
weakened
the
dam
of
the
alette
and
the
vineyards
will
be
in
danger
if
we
do
rebuild
at
once
she
suppressed
a
yawn
thinking
as
she
did
so
how
dull
he
always
looked
when
he
talked
of
agriculture
it
made
him
seem
years
older
and
she
reflected
with
a
shiver
that
listening
to
him
probably
gave
her
the
same
look
he
went
on
as
she
handed
him
his
tea
i
sorry
it
should
happen
just
now
i
afraid
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
to
give
up
your
spring
in
paris
oh
no
no
she
broke
out
a
throng
of
grievances
choked
in
her
she
wanted
to
burst
into
sobs
like
a
child
i
know
it
a
disappointment
but
our
expenses
have
been
unusually
heavy
this
year
it
seems
to
me
they
always
are
i
do
see
why
we
should
give
up
paris
because
you
got
to
make
repairs
to
a
dam
is
hubert
ever
going
to
pay
back
that
money
he
looked
at
her
with
a
mild
surprise
but
surely
you
understood
at
the
time
that
it
wo
be
possible
till
his
wife
inherits
till
general
arlington
dies
you
mean
he
does
look
much
older
than
you
you
may
remember
that
i
showed
you
hubert
note
he
has
paid
the
interest
quite
regularly
that
kind
of
him
she
stood
up
flaming
with
rebellion
you
can
do
as
you
please
but
i
mean
to
go
to
paris
my
mother
is
not
going
i
did
intend
to
open
our
apartment
i
understand
but
i
shall
open
it
that
all
he
had
risen
too
and
she
saw
his
face
whiten
i
prefer
that
you
should
go
without
me
then
i
shall
go
and
stay
at
the
nouveau
luxe
with
my
american
friends
that
never
why
not
i
consider
it
unsuitable
your
considering
it
so
does
prove
it
they
stood
facing
each
other
quivering
with
an
equal
anger
then
he
controlled
himself
and
said
in
a
more
conciliatory
tone
you
never
seem
to
see
that
there
are
necessities
oh
neither
do
you
that
the
trouble
you
ca
keep
me
shut
up
here
all
my
life
and
interfere
with
everything
i
want
to
do
just
by
saying
it
unsuitable
i
never
interfered
with
your
spending
your
money
as
you
please
it
was
her
turn
to
stare
sincerely
wondering
mercy
i
should
hope
not
when
you
always
grudged
me
every
penny
of
yours
you
know
it
not
because
i
grudge
it
i
would
gladly
take
you
to
paris
if
i
had
the
money
you
can
always
find
the
money
to
spend
on
this
place
why
do
you
sell
it
if
it
so
fearfully
expensive
sell
it
sell
saint
desert
the
suggestion
seemed
to
strike
him
as
something
monstrously
almost
fiendishly
significant
as
if
her
random
word
had
at
last
thrust
into
his
hand
the
clue
to
their
whole
unhappy
difference
without
understanding
this
she
guessed
it
from
the
change
in
his
face
it
was
as
if
a
deadly
solvent
had
suddenly
decomposed
its
familiar
lines
well
why
not
his
horror
spurred
her
on
you
might
sell
some
of
the
things
in
it
anyhow
in
america
we
not
ashamed
to
sell
what
we
afford
to
keep
her
eyes
fell
on
the
storied
hangings
at
his
back
why
there
a
fortune
in
this
one
room
you
could
get
anything
you
chose
for
those
tapestries
and
you
stand
here
and
tell
me
you
a
pauper
his
glance
followed
hers
to
the
tapestries
and
then
returned
to
her
face
ah
you
do
understand
he
said
i
understand
that
you
care
for
all
this
old
stuff
more
than
you
do
for
me
and
that
you
rather
see
me
unhappy
and
miserable
than
touch
one
of
your
the
colour
came
slowly
back
to
his
face
but
it
hardened
into
lines
she
had
never
seen
he
looked
at
her
as
though
the
place
where
she
stood
were
empty
you
do
understand
he
said
again
xli
the
incident
left
undine
with
the
baffled
feeling
of
not
being
able
to
count
on
any
of
her
old
weapons
of
aggression
in
all
her
struggles
for
authority
her
sense
of
the
rightfulness
of
her
cause
had
been
measured
by
her
power
of
making
people
do
as
she
pleased
raymond
firmness
shook
her
faith
in
her
own
claims
and
a
blind
desire
to
wound
and
destroy
replaced
her
usual
intentness
on
gaining
her
end
but
her
ironies
were
as
ineffectual
as
her
arguments
and
his
imperviousness
was
the
more
exasperating
because
she
divined
that
some
of
the
things
she
said
would
have
hurt
him
if
any
one
else
had
said
them
it
was
the
fact
of
their
coming
from
her
that
made
them
innocuous
even
when
at
the
close
of
their
talk
she
had
burst
out
if
you
grudge
me
everything
i
care
about
we
better
separate
he
had
merely
answered
with
a
shrug
it
one
of
the
things
we
do
do
and
the
answer
had
been
like
the
slamming
of
an
iron
door
in
her
face
an
interval
of
silent
brooding
had
resulted
in
a
reaction
of
rebellion
she
dared
not
carry
out
her
threat
of
joining
her
compatriots
at
the
nouveau
luxe
she
had
too
clear
a
memory
of
the
results
of
her
former
revolt
but
neither
could
she
submit
to
her
present
fate
without
attempting
to
make
raymond
understand
his
selfish
folly
she
had
failed
to
prove
it
by
argument
but
she
had
an
inherited
faith
in
the
value
of
practical
demonstration
if
he
could
be
made
to
see
how
easily
he
could
give
her
what
she
wanted
perhaps
he
might
come
round
to
her
view
with
this
idea
in
mind
she
had
gone
up
to
paris
for
hours
on
the
pretext
of
finding
a
new
nurse
for
paul
and
the
steps
then
taken
had
enabled
her
on
the
first
occasion
to
set
her
plan
in
motion
the
occasion
was
furnished
by
raymond
next
trip
to
beaune
he
went
off
early
one
morning
leaving
word
that
he
should
not
be
back
till
night
and
on
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
she
stood
at
her
usual
post
in
the
gallery
scanning
the
long
perspective
of
the
poplar
avenue
she
had
not
stood
there
long
before
a
black
speck
at
the
end
of
the
avenue
expanded
into
a
motor
that
was
presently
throbbing
at
the
entrance
undine
at
its
approach
turned
from
the
window
and
as
she
moved
down
the
gallery
her
glance
rested
on
the
great
tapestries
with
their
ineffable
minglings
of
blue
and
rose
as
complacently
as
though
they
had
been
mirrors
reflecting
her
own
image
she
was
still
looking
at
them
when
the
door
opened
and
a
servant
ushered
in
a
small
swarthy
man
who
in
spite
of
his
conspicuously
clothes
had
an
odd
exotic
air
as
if
he
had
worn
rings
in
his
ears
or
left
a
bale
of
spices
at
the
door
he
bowed
to
undine
cast
a
rapid
eye
up
and
down
the
room
and
then
with
his
back
to
the
windows
stood
intensely
contemplating
the
wall
that
faced
them
undine
heart
was
beating
excitedly
she
knew
the
old
marquise
was
taking
her
afternoon
nap
in
her
room
yet
each
sound
in
the
silent
house
seemed
to
be
that
of
her
heels
on
the
stairs
ah
said
the
visitor
he
had
begun
to
pace
slowly
down
the
gallery
keeping
his
face
to
the
tapestries
like
an
actor
playing
to
the
footlights
ah
he
said
again
to
ease
the
tension
of
her
nerves
undine
began
they
were
given
by
louis
the
fifteenth
to
the
marquis
de
chelles
who
their
history
has
been
published
the
visitor
briefly
interposed
and
she
coloured
at
her
blunder
the
swarthy
stranger
fitting
a
pair
of
to
a
nose
that
was
like
an
instrument
of
precision
had
begun
a
closer
and
more
detailed
inspection
of
the
tapestries
he
seemed
totally
unmindful
of
her
presence
and
his
air
of
lofty
indifference
was
beginning
to
make
her
wish
she
had
not
sent
for
him
his
manner
in
paris
had
been
so
different
suddenly
he
turned
and
took
off
the
glasses
which
sprang
back
into
a
fold
of
his
clothing
like
retracted
feelers
yes
he
stood
and
looked
at
her
without
seeing
her
very
well
i
have
brought
down
a
gentleman
a
gentleman
the
greatest
american
collector
he
buys
only
the
best
he
will
not
be
long
in
paris
and
it
was
his
only
chance
of
coming
down
undine
drew
herself
up
i
do
understand
i
never
said
the
tapestries
were
for
sale
precisely
but
this
gentleman
buys
only
this
that
are
not
for
sale
it
sounded
dazzling
and
she
wavered
i
do
know
you
were
only
to
put
a
price
on
them
let
me
see
him
look
at
them
first
then
i
put
a
price
on
them
he
chuckled
and
without
waiting
for
her
answer
he
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
the
gesture
revealed
the
back
of
a
gentleman
who
stood
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
hall
examining
the
bust
of
a
seventeenth
century
the
dealer
addressed
the
back
respectfully
mr
moffatt
moffatt
who
appeared
to
be
interested
in
the
bust
glanced
over
his
shoulder
without
moving
see
here
his
glance
took
in
undine
widened
to
astonishment
and
passed
into
apostrophe
well
if
this
ai
the
damnedest
he
came
forward
and
took
her
by
both
hands
why
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
down
here
she
laughed
and
blushed
in
a
tremor
at
the
odd
turn
of
the
adventure
i
live
here
did
you
know
not
a
word
never
thought
of
asking
the
party
name
he
turned
jovially
to
the
bowing
dealer
say
i
told
you
those
have
to
be
out
and
outers
to
make
up
for
the
trip
but
now
i
see
i
was
mistaken
undine
looked
at
him
curiously
his
physical
appearance
was
unchanged
he
was
as
compact
and
ruddy
as
ever
with
the
same
astute
eyes
under
the
same
guileless
brow
but
his
had
become
less
aggressive
and
she
had
never
seen
him
so
gallantly
at
ease
i
did
know
you
become
a
great
collector
the
greatest
did
he
tell
you
so
i
thought
that
was
why
i
was
allowed
to
come
she
hesitated
of
course
you
know
the
tapestries
are
not
for
sale
that
so
i
thought
that
was
only
his
dodge
to
get
me
down
well
glad
they
ai
it
give
us
more
time
to
talk
watch
in
hand
the
dealer
intervened
if
nevertheless
you
would
first
take
a
glance
our
train
it
ai
mine
moffatt
interrupted
at
least
not
if
there
a
later
one
undine
presence
of
mind
had
returned
of
course
there
is
she
said
gaily
she
led
the
way
back
into
the
gallery
half
hoping
the
dealer
would
allege
a
pressing
reason
for
departure
she
was
excited
and
amused
at
moffatt
unexpected
appearance
but
humiliated
that
he
should
suspect
her
of
being
in
financial
straits
she
never
wanted
to
see
moffatt
except
when
she
was
happy
and
triumphant
the
dealer
had
followed
the
other
two
into
the
gallery
and
there
was
a
moment
pause
while
they
all
stood
silently
before
the
tapestries
by
george
moffatt
finally
brought
out
they
historical
you
know
the
king
gave
them
to
the
other
day
when
i
was
in
paris
undine
hurried
on
i
asked
fleischhauer
to
come
down
some
time
and
tell
us
what
they
worth
and
he
seems
to
have
misunderstood
to
have
thought
we
meant
to
sell
them
she
addressed
herself
more
pointedly
to
the
dealer
i
sorry
you
had
the
trip
for
nothing
fleischhauer
inclined
himself
eloquently
it
is
not
nothing
to
have
seen
such
beauty
moffatt
gave
him
a
humorous
look
i
hate
to
see
fleischhauer
miss
his
train
i
shall
not
miss
it
i
miss
nothing
said
fleischhauer
he
bowed
to
undine
and
backed
toward
the
door
see
here
moffatt
called
to
him
as
he
reached
the
threshold
you
let
the
motor
take
you
to
the
station
and
charge
up
this
trip
to
me
when
the
door
closed
he
turned
to
undine
with
a
laugh
well
this
beats
the
band
i
thought
of
course
you
were
living
up
in
paris
again
she
felt
a
twinge
of
embarrassment
oh
french
people
i
mean
my
husband
kind
always
spend
a
part
of
the
year
on
their
estates
but
not
this
part
do
they
why
everything
humming
up
there
now
i
was
dining
at
the
nouveau
luxe
last
night
with
the
driscolls
and
shallums
and
rolliver
and
all
your
old
crowd
were
there
whooping
things
up
the
driscolls
and
shallums
and
rolliver
how
carelessly
he
reeled
off
their
names
one
could
see
from
his
tone
that
he
was
one
of
them
and
wanted
her
to
know
it
and
nothing
could
have
given
her
a
completer
sense
of
his
achievement
of
the
number
of
millions
he
must
be
worth
it
must
have
come
about
very
recently
yet
he
was
already
at
ease
in
his
new
honours
he
had
the
metropolitan
tone
while
she
examined
him
with
these
thoughts
in
her
mind
she
was
aware
of
his
giving
her
as
close
a
scrutiny
but
i
suppose
you
got
your
own
crowd
now
he
continued
you
always
were
a
lap
ahead
of
me
he
sent
his
glance
down
the
lordly
length
of
the
room
it
sorter
funny
to
see
you
in
this
kind
of
place
but
you
look
it
you
always
do
look
it
she
laughed
so
do
you
i
was
just
thinking
it
their
eyes
met
i
suppose
you
must
be
awfully
rich
he
laughed
too
holding
her
eyes
oh
out
of
sight
the
consolidation
set
me
on
my
feet
i
own
pretty
near
the
whole
of
apex
i
came
down
to
buy
these
tapestries
for
my
private
car
the
familiar
accent
of
hyperbole
exhilarated
her
i
do
suppose
i
could
stop
you
if
you
really
wanted
them
nobody
can
stop
me
now
if
i
want
anything
they
were
looking
at
each
other
with
challenge
and
complicity
in
their
eyes
his
voice
his
look
all
the
loud
confident
vigorous
things
he
embodied
and
expressed
set
her
blood
beating
with
curiosity
i
know
you
and
rolliver
were
friends
she
said
oh
jim
his
accent
verged
on
the
protective
old
jim
all
right
he
in
congress
now
i
got
to
have
somebody
up
in
washington
he
had
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
with
his
head
thrown
back
and
his
lips
shaped
to
the
familiar
noiseless
whistle
was
looking
slowly
and
discerningly
about
him
presently
his
eyes
reverted
to
her
face
so
this
is
what
i
helped
you
to
get
he
said
i
always
meant
to
run
over
some
day
and
take
a
look
what
is
it
they
call
you
a
marquise
she
paled
a
little
and
then
flushed
again
what
made
you
do
it
she
broke
out
abruptly
i
often
wondered
he
laughed
what
lend
you
a
hand
why
my
business
instinct
i
suppose
i
saw
you
were
in
a
tight
place
that
time
i
ran
across
you
in
paris
and
i
had
any
grudge
against
you
fact
is
i
never
had
the
time
to
nurse
old
scores
and
if
you
neglect
they
die
off
like
he
was
still
composedly
regarding
her
it
funny
to
think
of
your
having
settled
down
to
this
kind
of
life
i
hope
you
got
what
you
wanted
this
is
a
great
place
you
live
in
yes
but
i
see
a
little
too
much
of
it
we
live
here
most
of
the
year
she
had
meant
to
give
him
the
illusion
of
success
but
some
underlying
community
of
instinct
drew
the
confession
from
her
lips
that
so
why
on
earth
do
you
cut
it
and
come
up
to
paris
oh
raymond
absorbed
in
the
estates
and
we
have
got
the
money
this
place
eats
it
all
up
well
that
sounds
aristocratic
but
ai
it
rather
out
of
date
when
the
swells
are
nowadays
they
generally
chip
off
an
heirloom
he
wheeled
round
again
to
the
tapestries
there
are
a
good
many
paris
seasons
hanging
right
here
on
this
wall
yes
i
know
she
tried
to
check
herself
to
summon
up
a
glittering
equivocation
but
his
face
his
voice
the
very
words
he
used
were
like
so
many
demolishing
the
unrealities
that
imprisoned
her
here
was
some
one
who
spoke
her
language
who
knew
her
meanings
who
understood
instinctively
all
the
wants
for
which
her
acquired
vocabulary
had
no
terms
and
as
she
talked
she
once
more
seemed
to
herself
intelligent
eloquent
and
interesting
of
course
it
frightfully
lonely
down
here
she
began
and
through
the
opening
made
by
the
admission
the
whole
flood
of
her
grievances
poured
forth
she
tried
to
let
him
see
that
she
had
not
sacrificed
herself
for
nothing
she
touched
on
the
superiorities
of
her
situation
she
gilded
the
circumstances
of
which
she
called
herself
the
victim
and
let
titles
offices
and
attributes
shed
their
utmost
lustre
on
her
tale
but
what
she
had
to
boast
of
seemed
small
and
tinkling
compared
with
the
evidences
of
his
power
well
it
a
downright
shame
you
do
go
round
more
he
kept
saying
and
she
felt
ashamed
of
her
tame
acceptance
of
her
fate
when
she
had
told
her
story
she
asked
for
his
and
for
the
first
time
she
listened
to
it
with
interest
he
had
what
he
wanted
at
last
the
apex
consolidation
scheme
after
a
long
interval
of
suspense
had
obtained
its
charter
and
shot
out
huge
ramifications
rolliver
had
stood
in
with
him
at
the
critical
moment
and
between
them
they
had
chucked
out
old
harmon
driscoll
bag
and
baggage
and
got
the
whole
town
in
their
control
absorbed
in
his
theme
and
forgetting
her
inability
to
follow
him
moffatt
launched
out
on
an
epic
recital
of
plot
and
counterplot
and
she
hung
a
new
desdemona
on
his
conflict
with
the
new
anthropophagi
it
was
of
no
consequence
that
the
details
and
the
technicalities
escaped
her
she
knew
their
meaningless
syllables
stood
for
success
and
what
that
meant
was
as
clear
as
day
to
her
every
wall
street
term
had
its
equivalent
in
the
language
of
fifth
avenue
and
while
he
talked
of
building
up
railways
she
was
building
up
palaces
and
picturing
all
the
multiple
lives
he
would
lead
in
them
to
have
things
had
always
seemed
to
her
the
first
essential
of
existence
and
as
she
listened
to
him
the
vision
of
the
things
he
could
have
unrolled
itself
before
her
like
the
long
triumph
of
an
asiatic
conqueror
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
next
she
asked
almost
breathlessly
when
he
had
ended
oh
there
always
a
lot
to
do
next
business
never
goes
to
sleep
yes
but
i
mean
besides
business
why
everything
i
can
i
guess
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
an
air
of
placid
power
as
if
he
were
so
sure
of
getting
what
he
wanted
that
there
was
no
longer
any
use
in
hurrying
huge
as
his
vistas
had
become
she
continued
to
question
him
and
he
began
to
talk
of
his
growing
passion
for
pictures
and
furniture
and
of
his
desire
to
form
a
collection
which
should
be
a
great
representative
assemblage
of
unmatched
specimens
as
he
spoke
she
saw
his
expression
change
and
his
eyes
grow
younger
almost
boyish
with
a
concentrated
look
in
them
that
reminded
her
of
things
i
mean
to
have
the
best
you
know
not
just
to
get
ahead
of
the
other
fellows
but
because
i
know
it
when
i
see
it
i
guess
that
the
only
good
reason
he
concluded
and
he
added
looking
at
her
with
a
smile
it
was
what
you
were
always
after
was
it
xlii
undine
had
gained
her
point
and
the
entresol
of
the
hotel
de
chelles
reopened
its
doors
for
the
season
hubert
and
his
wife
in
expectation
of
the
birth
of
an
heir
had
withdrawn
to
the
sumptuous
chateau
which
general
arlington
had
hired
for
them
near
compiegne
and
undine
was
at
least
spared
the
sight
of
their
bright
windows
and
animated
stairway
but
she
had
to
take
her
share
of
the
felicitations
which
the
whole
circle
of
friends
and
relations
distributed
to
every
member
of
hubert
family
on
the
approach
of
the
happy
event
nor
was
this
the
hardest
of
her
trials
raymond
had
done
what
she
asked
he
had
stood
out
against
his
mother
protests
set
aside
considerations
of
prudence
and
consented
to
go
up
to
paris
for
two
months
but
he
had
done
so
on
the
understanding
that
during
their
stay
they
should
exercise
the
most
unremitting
economy
as
put
the
heaviest
strain
on
their
budget
all
hospitality
was
suspended
and
when
undine
attempted
to
invite
a
few
friends
informally
she
was
warned
that
she
could
not
do
so
without
causing
the
gravest
offense
to
the
many
others
genealogically
entitled
to
the
same
attention
raymond
insistence
on
this
rule
was
simply
part
of
an
elaborate
and
inveterate
system
of
relations
the
whole
of
french
social
life
seemed
to
depend
on
the
exact
interpretation
of
that
word
and
undine
felt
the
uselessness
of
struggling
against
such
mysterious
inhibitions
he
reminded
her
however
that
their
inability
to
receive
would
give
them
all
the
more
opportunity
for
going
out
and
he
showed
himself
more
socially
disposed
than
in
the
past
but
his
concession
did
not
result
as
she
had
hoped
they
were
asked
out
as
much
as
ever
but
they
were
asked
to
big
dinners
to
impersonal
crushes
to
the
kind
of
entertainment
it
is
a
slight
to
be
omitted
from
but
no
compliment
to
be
included
in
nothing
could
have
been
more
galling
to
undine
and
she
frankly
bewailed
the
fact
to
madame
de
trezac
of
course
it
what
was
sure
to
come
of
being
mewed
up
for
months
and
months
in
the
country
we
out
of
everything
and
the
people
who
are
having
a
good
time
are
simply
too
busy
to
remember
us
we
only
asked
to
the
things
that
are
made
up
from
madame
de
trezac
listened
sympathetically
but
did
not
suppress
a
candid
answer
it
not
altogether
that
my
dear
raymond
not
a
man
his
friends
forget
it
rather
more
if
you
excuse
my
saying
so
the
fact
of
your
being
you
personally
in
the
wrong
set
the
wrong
set
why
i
in
his
set
the
one
that
thinks
itself
too
good
for
all
the
others
that
what
you
always
told
me
when
i
said
it
bored
me
well
that
what
i
mean
madame
de
trezac
took
the
plunge
it
not
a
question
of
your
being
bored
undine
coloured
but
she
could
take
the
hardest
thrusts
where
her
personal
interest
was
involved
you
mean
that
i
the
bore
then
well
you
do
work
hard
enough
you
do
keep
up
it
not
that
they
do
admire
you
your
looks
i
mean
they
think
you
beautiful
delighted
to
bring
you
out
at
their
big
dinners
with
the
sevres
and
the
plate
but
a
woman
has
got
to
be
something
more
than
to
have
a
chance
to
be
intimate
with
them
she
got
to
know
what
being
said
about
things
i
watched
you
the
other
night
at
the
duchess
and
half
the
time
you
had
an
idea
what
they
were
talking
about
i
always
either
but
then
i
have
to
put
up
with
the
big
dinners
undine
winced
under
the
criticism
but
she
had
never
lacked
insight
into
the
cause
of
her
own
failures
and
she
had
already
had
premonitions
of
what
madame
de
trezac
so
bluntly
phrased
when
raymond
ceased
to
be
interested
in
her
conversation
she
had
concluded
it
was
the
way
of
husbands
but
since
then
it
had
been
slowly
dawning
on
her
that
she
produced
the
same
effect
on
others
her
entrances
were
always
triumphs
but
they
had
no
sequel
as
soon
as
people
began
to
talk
they
ceased
to
see
her
any
sense
of
insufficiency
exasperated
her
and
she
had
vague
thoughts
of
cultivating
herself
and
went
so
far
as
to
spend
a
morning
in
the
louvre
and
go
to
one
or
two
lectures
by
a
fashionable
philosopher
but
though
she
returned
from
these
expeditions
charged
with
opinions
their
expression
did
not
excite
the
interest
she
had
hoped
her
views
if
abundant
were
confused
and
the
more
she
said
the
more
nebulous
they
seemed
to
grow
she
was
disconcerted
moreover
by
finding
that
everybody
appeared
to
know
about
the
things
she
thought
she
had
discovered
and
her
comments
clearly
produced
more
bewilderment
than
interest
remembering
the
attention
she
had
attracted
on
her
first
appearance
in
raymond
world
she
concluded
that
she
had
gone
off
or
grown
dowdy
and
instead
of
wasting
more
time
in
museums
and
she
prolonged
her
hours
at
the
and
gave
up
the
rest
of
the
day
to
the
scientific
cultivation
of
her
beauty
i
suppose
i
turned
into
a
perfect
frump
down
there
in
that
wilderness
she
lamented
to
madame
de
trezac
who
replied
inexorably
oh
no
you
as
handsome
as
ever
but
people
here
do
go
on
looking
at
each
other
forever
as
they
do
in
london
meanwhile
financial
cares
became
more
pressing
a
dunning
letter
from
one
of
her
tradesmen
fell
into
raymond
hands
and
the
talk
it
led
to
ended
in
his
making
it
clear
to
her
that
she
must
settle
her
personal
debts
without
his
aid
all
the
scenes
about
money
which
had
disturbed
her
past
had
ended
in
some
mysterious
solution
of
her
difficulty
disagreeable
as
they
were
she
had
always
vulgarly
speaking
found
they
paid
but
now
it
was
she
who
was
expected
to
pay
raymond
took
his
stand
without
or
apology
he
simply
argued
from
inveterate
precedent
but
it
was
impossible
for
undine
to
understand
a
social
organization
which
did
not
regard
the
indulging
of
woman
as
its
first
purpose
or
to
believe
that
any
one
taking
another
view
was
not
moved
by
avarice
or
malice
and
the
discussion
ended
in
mutual
acrimony
the
morning
afterward
raymond
came
into
her
room
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
is
this
your
doing
he
asked
his
look
and
voice
expressed
something
she
had
never
known
before
the
disciplined
anger
of
a
man
trained
to
keep
his
emotions
in
fixed
channels
but
knowing
how
to
fill
them
to
the
brim
the
letter
was
from
fleischhauer
who
begged
to
transmit
to
the
marquis
de
chelles
an
offer
for
his
boucher
tapestries
from
a
client
prepared
to
pay
the
large
sum
named
on
condition
that
it
was
accepted
before
his
approaching
departure
for
america
what
does
it
mean
raymond
continued
as
she
did
not
speak
how
should
i
know
it
a
lot
of
money
she
stammered
shaken
out
of
her
she
had
not
expected
so
prompt
a
sequel
to
the
dealer
visit
and
she
was
vexed
with
him
for
writing
to
raymond
without
consulting
her
but
she
recognized
moffatt
way
and
her
fears
faded
in
the
great
blaze
of
the
sum
he
offered
her
husband
was
still
looking
at
her
it
was
fleischhauer
who
brought
a
man
down
to
see
the
tapestries
one
day
when
i
was
away
at
beaune
he
had
known
then
everything
was
known
at
saint
desert
she
wavered
a
moment
and
then
gave
him
back
his
look
yes
it
was
fleischhauer
and
i
sent
for
him
you
sent
for
him
he
spoke
in
a
voice
so
veiled
and
repressed
that
he
seemed
to
be
consciously
saving
it
for
some
premeditated
outbreak
undine
felt
its
menace
but
the
thought
of
moffatt
sent
a
flame
through
her
and
the
words
he
would
have
spoken
seemed
to
fly
to
her
lips
why
should
i
something
had
to
be
done
we
ca
go
on
as
we
are
i
tried
my
best
to
economize
i
scraped
and
scrimped
and
gone
without
heaps
of
things
i
always
had
i
moped
for
months
and
months
at
saint
desert
and
given
up
sending
paul
to
school
because
it
was
too
expensive
and
asking
my
friends
to
dine
because
we
afford
it
and
you
expect
me
to
go
on
living
like
this
for
the
rest
of
my
life
when
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
hold
out
your
hand
and
have
two
million
francs
drop
into
it
her
husband
stood
looking
at
her
coldly
and
curiously
as
though
she
were
some
alien
apparition
his
eyes
had
never
before
beheld
ah
that
your
answer
that
all
you
feel
when
you
lay
hands
on
things
that
are
sacred
to
us
he
stopped
a
moment
and
then
let
his
voice
break
out
with
the
volume
she
had
felt
it
to
be
gathering
and
you
all
alike
he
exclaimed
every
one
of
you
you
come
among
us
from
a
country
we
do
know
and
ca
imagine
a
country
you
care
for
so
little
that
before
you
been
a
day
in
ours
you
forgotten
the
very
house
you
were
born
in
if
it
was
torn
down
before
you
knew
it
you
come
among
us
speaking
our
language
and
not
knowing
what
we
mean
wanting
the
things
we
want
and
not
knowing
why
we
want
them
aping
our
weaknesses
exaggerating
our
follies
ignoring
or
ridiculing
all
we
care
about
you
come
from
hotels
as
big
as
towns
and
from
towns
as
flimsy
as
paper
where
the
streets
have
had
time
to
be
named
and
the
buildings
are
demolished
before
they
dry
and
the
people
are
as
proud
of
changing
as
we
are
of
holding
to
what
we
have
and
we
fools
enough
to
imagine
that
because
you
copy
our
ways
and
pick
up
our
slang
you
understand
anything
about
the
things
that
make
life
decent
and
honourable
for
us
he
stopped
again
his
white
face
and
drawn
nostrils
giving
him
so
much
the
look
of
an
extremely
distinguished
actor
in
a
fine
part
that
in
spite
of
the
vehemence
of
his
emotion
his
silence
might
have
been
the
deliberate
pause
for
a
replique
undine
kept
him
waiting
long
enough
to
give
the
effect
of
having
lost
her
cue
then
she
brought
out
with
a
little
soft
stare
of
incredulity
do
you
mean
to
say
you
going
to
refuse
such
an
offer
ah
he
turned
back
from
the
door
and
picking
up
the
letter
that
lay
on
the
table
between
them
tore
it
in
pieces
and
tossed
the
pieces
on
the
floor
that
how
i
refuse
it
the
violence
of
his
tone
and
gesture
made
her
feel
as
though
the
fluttering
strips
were
so
many
lashes
laid
across
her
face
and
a
rage
that
was
half
fear
possessed
her
how
dare
you
speak
to
me
like
that
nobody
ever
dared
to
before
is
talking
to
a
woman
in
that
way
one
of
the
things
you
call
decent
and
honourable
now
that
i
know
what
you
feel
about
me
i
do
want
to
stay
in
your
house
another
day
and
i
do
mean
to
i
mean
to
walk
out
of
it
this
very
hour
for
a
moment
they
stood
face
to
face
the
depths
of
their
mutual
incomprehension
at
last
bared
to
each
other
angry
eyes
then
raymond
his
glance
travelling
past
her
pointed
to
the
fragments
of
paper
on
the
floor
if
you
capable
of
that
you
capable
of
anything
he
said
as
he
went
out
of
the
room
xliii
she
watched
him
go
in
a
kind
of
stupour
knowing
that
when
they
next
met
he
would
be
as
courteous
and
as
if
nothing
had
happened
but
that
everything
would
nevertheless
go
on
in
the
same
way
in
his
way
and
that
there
was
no
more
hope
of
shaking
his
resolve
or
altering
his
point
of
view
than
there
would
have
been
of
transporting
the
masonry
of
saint
desert
by
means
of
the
wheeled
supports
on
which
apex
architecture
performed
its
easy
transits
one
of
her
childish
rages
possessed
her
sweeping
away
every
feeling
save
the
primitive
impulse
to
hurt
and
destroy
but
search
as
she
would
she
could
not
find
a
crack
in
the
strong
armour
of
her
husband
habits
and
prejudices
for
a
long
time
she
continued
to
sit
where
he
had
left
her
staring
at
the
portraits
on
the
walls
as
though
they
had
joined
hands
to
imprison
her
hitherto
she
had
almost
always
felt
herself
a
match
for
circumstances
but
now
the
very
dead
were
leagued
to
defeat
her
people
she
had
never
seen
and
whose
names
she
could
even
remember
seemed
to
be
plotting
and
contriving
against
her
under
the
escutcheoned
of
saint
desert
her
eyes
turned
to
the
old
furniture
beneath
the
pictures
and
to
her
own
idle
image
in
the
mirror
above
the
mantelpiece
even
in
that
one
small
room
there
were
enough
things
of
price
to
buy
a
release
from
her
most
pressing
cares
and
the
great
house
in
which
the
room
was
a
mere
cell
and
the
other
greater
house
in
burgundy
held
treasures
to
deplete
even
such
a
purse
as
moffatt
she
liked
to
see
such
things
about
her
without
any
real
sense
of
their
meaning
she
felt
them
to
be
the
appropriate
setting
of
a
pretty
woman
to
embody
something
of
the
rareness
and
distinction
she
had
always
considered
she
possessed
and
she
reflected
that
if
she
had
still
been
moffatt
wife
he
would
have
given
her
just
such
a
setting
and
the
power
to
live
in
it
as
became
her
the
thought
sent
her
memory
flying
back
to
things
she
had
turned
it
from
for
years
for
the
first
time
since
their
weeks
together
she
let
herself
relive
the
brief
adventure
she
had
been
drawn
to
elmer
moffatt
from
the
first
from
the
day
when
ben
frusk
indiana
brother
had
brought
him
to
a
church
picnic
at
mulvey
grove
and
he
had
taken
instant
possession
of
undine
sitting
in
the
big
stage
beside
her
on
the
ride
to
the
grove
supplanting
millard
binch
to
whom
she
was
still
though
intermittently
and
incompletely
engaged
swinging
her
between
the
trees
rowing
her
on
the
lake
catching
and
kissing
her
in
forfeits
awarding
her
the
first
prize
in
the
beauty
show
he
hilariously
organized
and
gallantly
carried
out
and
finally
no
one
knew
how
contriving
to
borrow
a
buggy
and
a
fast
colt
from
old
mulvey
and
driving
off
with
her
at
a
gait
while
millard
and
the
others
took
their
dust
in
the
crawling
stage
no
one
in
apex
knew
where
young
moffatt
had
come
from
and
he
offered
no
information
on
the
subject
he
simply
appeared
one
day
behind
the
counter
in
luckaback
dollar
drifted
thence
to
the
office
of
semple
and
binch
the
reappeared
as
the
stenographer
of
the
police
court
and
finally
edged
his
way
into
the
of
the
apex
he
boarded
with
old
flynn
down
in
north
fifth
street
on
the
edge
of
the
slum
he
never
went
to
church
or
attended
lectures
or
showed
any
desire
to
improve
or
refine
himself
but
he
managed
to
get
himself
invited
to
all
the
picnics
and
lodge
sociables
and
at
a
supper
of
the
phi
upsilon
society
to
which
he
had
contrived
to
affiliate
himself
he
made
the
best
speech
that
had
been
heard
there
since
young
jim
rolliver
first
flights
the
brothers
of
undine
friends
all
pronounced
him
great
though
he
had
fits
of
uncouthness
that
made
the
young
women
slower
in
admitting
him
to
favour
but
at
the
mulvey
grove
picnic
he
suddenly
seemed
to
dominate
them
all
and
undine
as
she
drove
away
with
him
tasted
the
public
triumph
which
was
necessary
to
her
personal
enjoyment
after
that
he
became
a
leading
figure
in
the
youthful
world
of
apex
and
no
one
was
surprised
when
the
sons
of
jonadab
the
local
temperance
society
invited
him
to
deliver
their
fourth
of
july
oration
the
ceremony
took
place
as
usual
in
the
baptist
church
and
undine
all
in
white
with
a
red
rose
in
her
breast
sat
just
beneath
the
platform
with
indiana
jealously
glaring
at
her
from
a
less
privileged
seat
and
poor
millard
long
neck
craning
over
the
row
of
prominent
citizens
behind
the
orator
elmer
moffatt
had
been
magnificent
rolling
out
his
alternating
effects
of
humour
and
pathos
stirring
his
audience
by
moving
references
to
the
blue
and
the
gray
convulsing
them
by
a
new
version
of
washington
and
the
cherry
tree
in
which
the
infant
patriot
was
depicted
as
having
cut
down
the
tree
to
check
the
deleterious
spread
of
cherry
bounce
dazzling
them
by
his
erudite
allusions
and
apt
quotations
he
confessed
to
undine
that
he
had
sat
up
half
the
night
over
bartlett
and
winding
up
with
a
peroration
that
drew
tears
from
the
grand
army
pensioners
in
the
front
row
and
caused
the
minister
wife
to
say
that
many
a
sermon
from
that
platform
had
been
less
uplifting
an
supper
always
followed
the
exercises
and
as
repairs
were
being
made
in
the
church
basement
which
was
the
usual
scene
of
the
festivity
the
minister
had
offered
the
use
of
his
house
the
long
table
ran
through
the
doorway
between
parlour
and
study
and
another
was
set
in
the
passage
outside
with
one
end
under
the
stairs
the
was
wreathed
in
and
early
and
temperance
texts
in
smilax
decked
the
walls
when
the
first
course
had
been
despatched
the
young
ladies
gallantly
seconded
by
the
younger
of
the
sons
helped
to
ladle
out
and
carry
in
the
which
stood
in
great
pails
on
the
larder
floor
and
to
replenish
the
jugs
of
lemonade
and
coffee
elmer
moffatt
was
indefatigable
in
performing
these
services
and
when
the
minister
wife
pressed
him
to
sit
down
and
take
a
mouthful
himself
he
modestly
declined
the
place
reserved
for
him
among
the
dignitaries
of
the
evening
and
withdrew
with
a
few
chosen
spirits
to
the
dim
beneath
the
stairs
explosions
of
hilarity
came
from
this
corner
with
increasing
frequency
and
now
and
then
tumultuous
rappings
and
howls
of
song
song
followed
by
adjurations
to
cough
it
up
and
let
her
go
drowned
the
conversational
efforts
at
the
other
table
at
length
the
noise
subsided
and
the
group
was
ceasing
to
attract
attention
when
toward
the
end
of
the
evening
the
upper
table
drooping
under
the
lengthy
elucubrations
of
the
minister
and
the
president
of
the
temperance
society
called
on
the
orator
of
the
day
for
a
few
remarks
there
was
an
interval
of
scuffling
and
laughter
beneath
the
stairs
and
then
the
minister
lifted
hand
enjoined
silence
and
elmer
moffatt
got
to
his
feet
step
out
where
the
ladies
can
hear
you
better
mr
moffatt
the
minister
called
moffatt
did
so
steadying
himself
against
the
table
and
twisting
his
head
about
as
if
his
collar
had
grown
too
tight
but
if
his
bearing
was
vacillating
his
smile
was
unabashed
and
there
was
no
lack
of
confidence
in
the
glance
he
threw
at
undine
spragg
as
he
began
ladies
and
gentlemen
if
there
one
thing
i
like
better
than
another
about
getting
drunk
and
i
like
most
everything
about
it
except
the
next
morning
it
the
opportunity
you
given
me
of
doing
it
right
here
in
the
presence
of
this
society
which
as
i
gather
from
its
literature
knows
more
about
the
subject
than
anybody
else
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
straightened
himself
and
the
slid
toward
him
ever
since
you
honoured
me
with
an
invitation
to
address
you
from
the
temperance
platform
i
been
assiduously
studying
that
literature
and
i
gathered
from
your
own
evidence
what
i
strongly
suspected
before
that
all
your
converted
drunkards
had
a
hell
of
a
good
time
before
you
got
at
and
that
and
that
a
good
many
of
have
gone
on
having
it
since
at
this
point
he
broke
off
swept
the
audience
with
his
confident
smile
and
then
collapsing
tried
to
sit
down
on
a
chair
that
did
happen
to
be
there
and
disappeared
among
his
agitated
supporters
there
was
a
moment
during
which
undine
through
the
doorway
saw
ben
frusk
and
the
others
close
about
the
fallen
orator
to
the
crash
of
crockery
and
tumbling
chairs
then
some
one
jumped
up
and
shut
the
parlour
door
and
a
sunday
school
teacher
who
had
been
nervously
waiting
his
chance
and
had
almost
given
it
up
rose
from
his
feet
and
recited
high
tide
at
gettysburg
amid
hysterical
applause
the
scandal
was
considerable
but
moffatt
though
he
vanished
from
the
social
horizon
managed
to
keep
his
place
in
the
till
he
went
off
for
a
week
and
turned
up
again
without
being
able
to
give
a
satisfactory
reason
for
his
absence
after
that
he
drifted
from
one
job
to
another
now
extolled
for
his
smartness
and
business
capacity
now
dismissed
in
disgrace
as
an
irresponsible
loafer
his
head
was
always
full
of
immense
nebulous
schemes
for
the
enlargement
and
development
of
any
business
he
happened
to
be
employed
in
sometimes
his
suggestions
interested
his
employers
but
proved
unpractical
and
inapplicable
sometimes
he
wore
out
their
patience
or
was
thought
to
be
a
dangerous
dreamer
whenever
he
found
there
was
no
hope
of
his
ideas
being
adopted
he
lost
interest
in
his
work
came
late
and
left
early
or
disappeared
for
two
or
three
days
at
a
time
without
troubling
himself
to
account
for
his
absences
at
last
even
those
who
had
been
cynical
enough
to
smile
over
his
disgrace
at
the
temperance
supper
began
to
speak
of
him
as
a
hopeless
failure
and
he
lost
the
support
of
the
feminine
community
when
one
sunday
morning
just
as
the
baptist
and
methodist
churches
were
releasing
their
congregations
he
walked
up
eubaw
avenue
with
a
young
woman
less
known
to
those
sacred
edifices
than
to
the
saloons
of
north
fifth
street
undine
estimate
of
people
had
always
been
based
on
their
apparent
power
of
getting
what
they
wanted
provided
it
came
under
the
category
of
things
she
understood
wanting
success
was
beauty
and
romance
to
her
yet
it
was
at
the
moment
when
elmer
moffatt
failure
was
most
complete
and
flagrant
that
she
suddenly
felt
the
extent
of
his
power
after
the
eubaw
avenue
scandal
he
had
been
asked
not
to
return
to
the
office
to
which
ben
frusk
had
managed
to
get
him
admitted
and
on
the
day
of
his
dismissal
he
met
undine
in
main
street
at
the
shopping
hour
and
sauntering
up
cheerfully
invited
her
to
take
a
walk
with
him
she
was
about
to
refuse
when
she
saw
millard
binch
mother
looking
at
her
disapprovingly
from
the
opposite
oh
well
i
will
she
said
and
they
walked
the
length
of
main
street
and
out
to
the
immature
park
in
which
it
ended
she
was
in
a
mood
of
aimless
discontent
and
unrest
tired
of
her
engagement
to
millard
binch
disappointed
with
moffatt
of
being
seen
with
him
and
yet
not
sorry
to
have
it
known
that
she
was
independent
enough
to
choose
her
companions
without
regard
to
the
apex
verdict
well
i
suppose
you
know
i
down
and
out
he
began
and
she
responded
virtuously
you
must
have
wanted
to
be
or
you
would
have
behaved
the
way
you
did
last
sunday
oh
shucks
he
sneered
what
do
i
care
in
a
place
like
this
if
it
had
been
for
you
i
have
got
a
move
on
long
ago
she
did
not
remember
afterward
what
else
he
said
she
recalled
only
the
expression
of
a
great
sweeping
scorn
of
apex
into
which
her
own
disdain
of
it
was
absorbed
like
a
drop
in
the
sea
and
the
affirmation
of
a
soaring
that
seemed
to
lift
her
on
wings
all
her
own
attempts
to
get
what
she
wanted
had
come
to
nothing
but
she
had
always
attributed
her
lack
of
success
to
the
fact
that
she
had
had
no
one
to
second
her
it
was
strange
that
elmer
moffatt
a
shiftless
from
even
the
small
world
she
despised
should
give
her
in
the
very
moment
of
his
downfall
the
sense
of
being
able
to
succeed
where
she
had
failed
it
was
a
feeling
she
never
had
in
his
absence
but
that
his
nearness
always
instantly
revived
and
he
seemed
nearer
to
her
now
than
he
had
ever
been
they
wandered
on
to
the
edge
of
the
vague
park
and
sat
down
on
a
bench
behind
the
empty
i
went
with
that
girl
on
purpose
and
you
know
it
he
broke
out
abruptly
it
makes
me
too
damned
sick
to
see
millard
binch
going
round
looking
as
if
he
patented
you
you
got
no
right
she
interrupted
and
suddenly
she
was
in
his
arms
and
feeling
that
no
one
had
ever
kissed
her
before
the
week
that
followed
was
a
big
bright
blur
the
wildest
vividest
moment
of
her
life
and
it
was
only
eight
days
later
that
they
were
in
the
train
together
apex
and
all
her
plans
and
promises
behind
them
and
a
bigger
and
brighter
blur
ahead
into
which
they
were
plunging
as
the
limited
plunged
into
the
sunset
undine
stood
up
looking
about
her
with
vague
eyes
as
if
she
had
come
back
from
a
long
distance
elmer
moffatt
was
still
in
paris
he
was
in
reach
within
she
stood
hesitating
a
moment
then
she
went
into
her
and
turning
over
the
pages
of
the
telephone
book
looked
out
the
number
of
the
nouveau
luxe
xliv
undine
had
been
right
in
supposing
that
her
husband
would
expect
their
life
to
go
on
as
before
there
was
no
appreciable
change
in
the
situation
save
that
he
was
more
often
abundant
reasons
agricultural
and
political
for
frequent
trips
to
saint
desert
and
that
when
in
paris
he
no
longer
showed
any
curiosity
concerning
her
occupations
and
engagements
they
lived
as
much
apart
is
if
their
cramped
domicile
had
been
a
palace
and
when
undine
as
she
now
frequently
did
joined
the
shallums
or
rollivers
for
a
dinner
at
the
nouveau
luxe
or
a
party
at
a
petit
theatre
she
was
not
put
to
the
trouble
of
prevaricating
her
first
impulse
after
her
scene
with
raymond
had
been
to
ring
up
indiana
rolliver
and
invite
herself
to
dine
it
chanced
that
indiana
who
was
now
in
full
social
progress
and
had
run
over
for
a
few
weeks
to
get
her
dresses
for
newport
had
organized
for
the
same
evening
a
showy
cosmopolitan
banquet
in
which
she
was
enchanted
to
include
the
marquise
de
chelles
and
undine
as
she
had
hoped
found
elmer
moffatt
of
the
party
when
she
drove
up
to
the
nouveau
luxe
she
had
not
fixed
on
any
plan
of
action
but
once
she
had
crossed
its
magic
threshold
her
energies
revived
like
plants
in
water
at
last
she
was
in
her
native
air
again
among
associations
she
shared
and
conventions
she
understood
and
all
her
returned
as
the
familiar
accents
uttered
the
accustomed
things
save
for
an
occasional
perfunctory
call
she
had
hitherto
made
no
effort
to
see
her
compatriots
and
she
noticed
that
jim
driscoll
and
bertha
shallum
received
her
with
a
touch
of
constraint
but
it
vanished
when
they
remarked
the
cordiality
of
moffatt
greeting
her
seat
was
at
his
side
and
her
old
sense
of
triumph
returned
as
she
perceived
the
importance
his
notice
conferred
not
only
in
the
eyes
of
her
own
party
but
of
the
other
diners
moffatt
was
evidently
a
notable
figure
in
all
the
worlds
represented
about
the
crowded
tables
and
undine
saw
that
many
people
who
seemed
personally
unacquainted
with
him
were
recognizing
and
pointing
him
out
she
was
conscious
of
receiving
a
large
share
of
the
attention
he
attracted
and
bathed
again
in
the
bright
air
of
publicity
she
remembered
the
evening
when
raymond
de
chelles
first
admiring
glance
had
given
her
the
same
sense
of
triumph
this
inopportune
memory
did
not
trouble
her
she
was
almost
grateful
to
raymond
for
giving
her
the
touch
of
superiority
her
compatriots
clearly
felt
in
her
it
was
not
merely
her
title
and
her
situation
but
the
experiences
she
had
gained
through
them
that
gave
her
this
advantage
over
the
loud
vague
company
she
had
learned
things
they
did
not
guess
shades
of
conduct
turns
of
speech
tricks
of
attitude
and
easy
and
free
and
enviable
as
she
thought
them
she
would
not
for
the
world
have
been
back
among
them
at
the
cost
of
knowing
no
more
than
they
moffatt
made
no
allusion
to
his
visit
to
saint
desert
but
when
the
party
had
itself
about
coffee
and
liqueurs
on
the
terrace
he
bent
over
to
ask
confidentially
what
about
my
tapestries
she
replied
in
the
same
tone
you
ought
to
have
let
fleischhauer
write
that
letter
my
husband
furious
he
seemed
honestly
surprised
why
did
i
offer
him
enough
he
furious
that
any
one
should
offer
anything
i
thought
when
he
found
out
what
they
were
worth
he
might
be
tempted
but
he
rather
see
me
starve
than
part
with
one
of
his
well
he
knows
now
what
the
tapestries
are
worth
i
offered
more
than
fleischhauer
advised
yes
but
you
were
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
i
got
to
be
i
going
back
next
week
she
felt
her
eyes
cloud
with
disappointment
oh
why
do
you
i
hoped
you
might
stay
on
they
looked
at
each
other
uncertainly
a
moment
then
he
dropped
his
voice
to
say
even
if
i
did
i
probably
should
see
anything
of
you
why
not
why
wo
you
come
and
see
me
i
always
wanted
to
be
friends
he
came
the
next
day
and
found
in
her
two
ladies
whom
she
introduced
as
her
the
ladies
lingered
on
for
a
long
time
sipping
their
tea
stiffly
and
exchanging
remarks
while
undine
talked
with
moffatt
and
when
they
left
with
small
sidelong
bows
in
his
direction
undine
exclaimed
now
you
see
how
they
all
watch
me
she
began
to
go
into
the
details
of
her
married
life
drawing
on
the
experiences
of
the
first
months
for
instances
that
scarcely
applied
to
her
present
liberated
state
she
could
thus
without
great
exaggeration
picture
herself
as
entrapped
into
a
bondage
hardly
conceivable
to
moffatt
and
she
saw
him
redden
with
excitement
as
he
listened
i
call
it
darned
low
darned
low
he
broke
in
at
intervals
of
course
i
go
round
more
now
she
concluded
i
mean
to
see
my
friends
i
do
care
what
he
says
what
can
he
say
oh
he
despises
americans
they
all
do
well
i
guess
we
can
still
sit
up
and
take
nourishment
they
laughed
and
slipped
back
to
talking
of
earlier
things
she
urged
him
to
put
off
his
sailing
there
were
so
many
things
they
might
do
together
and
excursions
and
she
could
perhaps
show
him
some
of
the
private
collections
he
had
seen
the
ones
it
was
hard
to
get
admitted
to
this
instantly
roused
his
attention
and
after
naming
one
or
two
collections
he
had
already
seen
she
hit
on
one
he
had
found
inaccessible
and
was
particularly
anxious
to
visit
there
an
ingres
there
that
one
of
the
things
i
came
over
to
have
a
look
at
but
i
was
told
there
was
no
use
trying
oh
i
can
easily
manage
it
the
duke
raymond
uncle
it
gave
her
a
peculiar
satisfaction
to
say
it
she
felt
as
though
she
were
taking
a
surreptitious
revenge
on
her
husband
but
he
down
in
the
country
this
week
she
continued
and
no
one
not
even
the
family
is
allowed
to
see
the
pictures
when
he
away
of
course
his
ingres
are
the
finest
in
france
she
ran
it
off
glibly
though
a
year
ago
she
had
never
heard
of
the
painter
and
did
not
even
now
remember
whether
he
was
an
old
master
or
one
of
the
very
new
ones
whose
names
one
had
had
time
to
learn
moffatt
put
off
sailing
saw
the
duke
ingres
under
her
guidance
and
accompanied
her
to
various
other
private
galleries
inaccessible
to
strangers
she
had
lived
in
almost
total
ignorance
of
such
opportunities
but
now
that
she
could
use
them
to
advantage
she
showed
a
surprising
quickness
in
picking
up
tips
ferreting
out
rare
things
and
getting
a
sight
of
hidden
treasures
she
even
acquired
as
much
of
the
jargon
as
a
pretty
woman
needs
to
produce
the
impression
of
being
and
moffatt
sailing
was
more
than
once
postponed
they
saw
each
other
almost
daily
for
she
continued
to
come
and
go
as
she
pleased
and
raymond
showed
neither
surprise
nor
disapproval
when
they
were
asked
to
family
dinners
she
usually
excused
herself
at
the
last
moment
on
the
plea
of
a
headache
and
calling
up
indiana
or
bertha
shallum
improvised
a
little
party
at
the
nouveau
luxe
and
on
other
occasions
she
accepted
such
invitations
as
she
chose
without
mentioning
to
her
husband
where
she
was
going
in
this
world
of
lavish
pleasures
she
lost
what
little
prudence
the
discipline
of
saint
desert
had
inculcated
she
could
never
be
with
people
who
had
all
the
things
she
envied
without
being
hypnotized
into
the
belief
that
she
had
only
to
put
her
hand
out
to
obtain
them
and
all
the
unassuaged
rancours
and
hungers
of
her
early
days
in
west
end
avenue
came
back
with
increased
acuity
she
knew
her
wants
so
much
better
now
and
was
so
much
more
worthy
of
the
things
she
wanted
she
had
given
up
hoping
that
her
father
might
make
another
hit
in
wall
street
spragg
letters
gave
the
impression
that
the
days
of
big
strokes
were
over
for
her
husband
that
he
had
gone
down
in
the
conflict
with
forces
beyond
his
measure
if
he
had
remained
in
apex
the
tide
of
its
new
prosperity
might
have
carried
him
to
wealth
but
new
york
huge
waves
of
success
had
submerged
instead
of
floating
him
and
enmity
was
a
hand
perpetually
stretched
out
to
strike
him
lower
at
most
spragg
tenacity
would
keep
him
at
the
level
he
now
held
and
though
he
and
his
wife
had
still
further
simplified
their
way
of
living
undine
understood
that
their
would
not
increase
her
opportunities
she
felt
no
compunction
in
continuing
to
accept
an
undiminished
allowance
it
was
the
hereditary
habit
of
the
parent
animal
to
despoil
himself
for
his
progeny
but
this
conviction
did
not
seem
incompatible
with
a
sentimental
pity
for
her
parents
aside
from
all
interested
motives
she
wished
for
their
own
sakes
that
they
were
better
off
their
personal
requirements
were
pathetically
limited
but
renewed
prosperity
would
at
least
have
procured
them
the
happiness
of
giving
her
what
she
wanted
moffatt
lingered
on
but
he
began
to
speak
more
definitely
of
sailing
and
undine
foresaw
the
day
when
strong
as
her
attraction
was
stronger
influences
would
snap
it
like
a
thread
she
knew
she
interested
and
amused
him
and
that
it
flattered
his
vanity
to
be
seen
with
her
and
to
hear
that
rumour
coupled
their
names
but
he
gave
her
more
than
any
one
she
had
ever
known
the
sense
of
being
detached
from
his
life
in
control
of
it
and
able
without
weakness
or
uncertainty
to
choose
which
of
its
calls
he
should
obey
if
the
call
were
that
of
business
of
any
of
the
great
perilous
affairs
he
handled
like
a
spinning
the
deadly
reptiles
about
his
head
she
knew
she
would
drop
from
his
life
like
a
loosened
leaf
these
anxieties
sharpened
the
intensity
of
her
enjoyment
and
made
the
contrast
keener
between
her
crowded
sparkling
hours
and
the
vacant
months
at
saint
desert
little
as
she
understood
of
the
qualities
that
made
moffatt
what
he
was
the
results
were
of
the
kind
most
palpable
to
her
he
used
life
exactly
as
she
would
have
used
it
in
his
place
some
of
his
enjoyments
were
beyond
her
range
but
even
these
appealed
to
her
because
of
the
money
that
was
required
to
gratify
them
when
she
took
him
to
see
some
inaccessible
picture
or
went
with
him
to
inspect
the
treasures
of
a
famous
dealer
she
saw
that
the
things
he
looked
at
moved
him
in
a
way
she
could
not
understand
and
that
the
actual
touching
of
rare
textures
bronze
or
marble
or
velvets
flushed
with
the
bloom
of
age
gave
him
sensations
like
those
her
own
beauty
had
once
roused
in
him
but
the
next
moment
he
was
laughing
over
some
commonplace
joke
or
absorbed
in
a
long
cipher
cable
handed
to
him
as
they
the
nouveau
luxe
for
tea
and
his
aesthetic
emotions
had
been
thrust
back
into
their
own
compartment
of
the
great
steel
of
his
mind
her
new
life
went
on
without
comment
or
interference
from
her
husband
and
she
saw
that
he
had
accepted
their
altered
relation
and
intended
merely
to
keep
up
an
external
semblance
of
harmony
to
that
semblance
she
knew
he
attached
intense
importance
it
was
an
article
of
his
complicated
social
creed
that
a
man
of
his
class
should
appear
to
live
on
good
terms
with
his
wife
for
different
reasons
it
was
scarcely
less
important
to
undine
she
had
no
wish
to
affront
again
the
social
reprobation
that
had
so
nearly
wrecked
her
but
she
could
not
keep
up
the
life
she
was
leading
without
more
money
a
great
deal
more
money
and
the
thought
of
contracting
her
expenditure
was
no
longer
tolerable
one
afternoon
several
weeks
later
she
came
in
to
find
a
representative
waiting
with
a
bill
there
was
a
noisy
scene
in
the
anteroom
before
the
man
threateningly
withdrew
a
scene
witnessed
by
the
servants
and
overheard
by
her
whom
she
found
seated
in
the
when
she
entered
the
old
marquise
visits
to
her
were
made
at
long
intervals
but
with
ritual
regularity
she
called
every
other
friday
at
five
and
undine
had
forgotten
that
she
was
due
that
day
this
did
not
make
for
greater
cordiality
between
them
and
the
altercation
in
the
anteroom
had
been
too
loud
for
concealment
the
marquise
was
on
her
feet
when
her
came
in
and
instantly
said
with
lowered
eyes
it
would
perhaps
be
best
for
me
to
go
oh
i
do
care
you
welcome
to
tell
raymond
you
heard
me
insulted
because
i
too
poor
to
pay
my
bills
he
knows
it
well
enough
already
the
words
broke
from
undine
unguardedly
but
once
spoken
they
nourished
her
defiance
i
sure
my
son
has
frequently
recommended
greater
prudence
the
marquise
murmured
yes
it
a
pity
he
did
recommend
it
to
your
other
son
instead
all
the
money
i
was
entitled
to
has
gone
to
pay
hubert
debts
raymond
has
told
me
that
there
are
certain
things
you
fail
to
understand
i
have
no
wish
whatever
to
discuss
them
the
marquise
had
gone
toward
the
door
with
her
hand
on
it
she
paused
to
add
i
shall
say
nothing
whatever
of
what
has
happened
her
icy
magnanimity
added
the
last
touch
to
undine
wrath
they
knew
her
extremity
one
and
all
and
it
did
not
move
them
at
most
they
would
join
in
concealing
it
like
a
blot
on
their
honour
and
the
menace
grew
and
mounted
and
not
a
hand
was
stretched
to
help
her
hardly
a
earlier
moffatt
with
whom
she
had
been
visiting
a
private
view
had
sent
her
home
in
his
motor
with
the
excuse
that
he
must
hurry
back
to
the
nouveau
luxe
to
meet
his
stenographer
and
sign
a
batch
of
letters
for
the
new
york
mail
it
was
therefore
probable
that
he
was
still
at
home
that
she
should
find
him
if
she
hastened
there
at
once
an
overwhelming
desire
to
cry
out
her
wrath
and
wretchedness
brought
her
to
her
feet
and
sent
her
down
to
hail
a
passing
cab
as
it
whirled
her
through
the
bright
streets
powdered
with
amber
sunlight
her
brain
throbbed
with
confused
intentions
she
did
not
think
of
moffatt
as
a
power
she
could
use
but
simply
as
some
one
who
knew
her
and
understood
her
grievance
it
was
essential
to
her
at
that
moment
to
be
told
that
she
was
right
and
that
every
one
opposed
to
her
was
wrong
at
the
hotel
she
asked
his
number
and
was
carried
up
in
the
lift
on
the
landing
she
paused
a
moment
disconcerted
it
had
occurred
to
her
that
he
might
not
be
alone
but
she
walked
on
quickly
found
the
number
and
knocked
moffatt
opened
the
door
and
she
glanced
beyond
him
and
saw
that
the
big
bright
was
empty
hullo
he
exclaimed
surprised
and
as
he
stood
aside
to
let
her
enter
she
saw
him
draw
out
his
watch
and
glance
at
it
surreptitiously
he
was
expecting
someone
or
he
had
an
engagement
elsewhere
something
claimed
him
from
which
she
was
excluded
the
thought
flushed
her
with
sudden
resolution
she
knew
now
what
she
had
come
for
to
keep
him
from
every
one
else
to
keep
him
for
herself
alone
do
send
me
away
she
said
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
beseechingly
xlv
she
advanced
into
the
room
and
slowly
looked
about
her
the
big
vulgar
wreathed
in
bronze
was
heaped
with
letters
and
papers
among
them
stood
a
lapis
bowl
in
a
renaissance
mounting
of
enamel
and
a
vase
of
phenician
glass
that
was
like
a
bit
of
rainbow
caught
in
cobwebs
on
a
table
against
the
window
a
little
greek
marble
lifted
its
pure
lines
on
every
side
some
rare
and
sensitive
object
seemed
to
be
shrinking
back
from
the
false
colours
and
crude
contours
of
the
hotel
furniture
there
were
no
books
in
the
room
but
the
florid
console
under
the
mirror
was
stacked
with
old
numbers
of
town
talk
and
the
new
york
radiator
undine
recalled
the
dingy
that
moffatt
had
lodged
in
at
flynn
over
hober
livery
stable
and
her
heart
beat
at
the
signs
of
his
altered
state
when
her
eyes
came
back
to
him
their
lids
were
moist
do
send
me
away
she
repeated
he
looked
at
her
and
smiled
what
is
it
what
the
matter
i
do
know
but
i
had
to
come
when
you
spoke
again
of
sailing
i
felt
as
if
i
could
stand
it
she
lifted
her
eyes
and
looked
in
his
profoundly
he
reddened
a
little
under
her
gaze
but
she
could
detect
no
softening
or
confusion
in
the
shrewd
steady
glance
he
gave
her
back
things
going
wrong
again
is
that
the
trouble
he
merely
asked
with
a
comforting
inflexion
they
always
are
wrong
it
all
been
an
awful
mistake
but
i
care
if
you
were
here
and
i
could
see
you
sometimes
you
so
strong
that
what
i
feel
about
you
elmer
i
was
the
only
one
to
feel
it
that
time
they
all
turned
against
you
out
at
apex
do
you
remember
the
afternoon
i
met
you
down
on
main
street
and
we
walked
out
together
to
the
park
i
knew
then
that
you
were
stronger
than
any
of
them
she
had
never
spoken
more
sincerely
for
the
moment
all
thought
of
was
in
abeyance
and
she
felt
again
as
she
had
felt
that
day
the
instinctive
yearning
of
her
nature
to
be
one
with
his
something
in
her
voice
must
have
attested
it
for
she
saw
a
change
in
his
face
you
not
the
beauty
you
were
he
said
irrelevantly
but
you
a
lot
more
fetching
the
oddly
qualified
praise
made
her
laugh
with
mingled
pleasure
and
annoyance
i
suppose
i
must
be
dreadfully
changed
you
all
right
but
i
got
to
go
back
home
he
broke
off
abruptly
i
put
it
off
too
long
she
paled
and
looked
away
helpless
in
her
sudden
disappointment
i
knew
you
say
that
and
i
shall
just
be
left
here
she
sat
down
on
the
sofa
near
which
they
had
been
standing
and
two
tears
formed
on
her
lashes
and
fell
moffatt
sat
down
beside
her
and
both
were
silent
she
had
never
seen
him
at
a
loss
before
she
made
no
attempt
to
draw
nearer
or
to
use
any
of
the
arts
of
cajolery
but
presently
she
said
without
rising
i
saw
you
look
at
your
watch
when
i
came
in
i
suppose
somebody
else
is
waiting
for
you
it
do
matter
some
other
woman
it
do
matter
i
wondered
so
often
but
of
course
i
got
no
right
to
ask
she
stood
up
slowly
understanding
that
he
meant
to
let
her
go
just
tell
me
one
thing
did
you
never
miss
me
oh
damnably
he
brought
out
with
sudden
bitterness
she
came
nearer
sinking
her
voice
to
a
low
whisper
it
the
only
time
i
ever
really
cared
all
through
he
had
risen
too
and
they
stood
intensely
gazing
at
each
other
moffatt
face
was
fixed
and
grave
as
she
had
seen
it
in
hours
she
now
found
herself
rapidly
reliving
i
believe
you
did
he
said
oh
elmer
if
i
known
if
i
only
known
he
made
no
answer
and
she
turned
away
touching
with
an
unconscious
hand
the
edge
of
the
lapis
bowl
among
his
papers
elmer
if
you
going
away
it
ca
do
any
harm
to
tell
me
is
there
any
one
else
he
gave
a
laugh
that
seemed
to
shake
him
free
in
that
kind
of
way
lord
no
too
busy
she
came
close
again
and
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
then
why
not
why
should
we
she
leaned
her
head
back
so
that
her
gaze
slanted
up
through
her
wet
lashes
i
can
do
as
i
please
my
husband
does
they
think
so
differently
about
marriage
over
here
it
just
a
business
contract
as
long
as
a
woman
does
make
a
show
of
herself
no
one
cares
she
put
her
other
hand
up
so
that
she
held
him
facing
her
i
always
felt
all
through
everything
that
i
belonged
to
you
moffatt
left
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
but
did
not
lift
his
own
to
clasp
them
for
a
moment
she
thought
she
had
mistaken
him
and
a
leaden
sense
of
shame
descended
on
her
then
he
asked
you
say
your
husband
goes
with
other
women
lili
estradina
taunt
flashed
through
her
and
she
seized
on
it
people
have
told
me
so
his
own
relations
have
i
never
stooped
to
spy
on
him
and
the
women
in
your
set
i
suppose
it
taken
for
granted
they
all
do
the
same
she
laughed
everything
fixed
up
for
them
same
as
it
is
for
the
husbands
eh
nobody
meddles
or
makes
trouble
if
you
know
the
ropes
no
nobody
it
all
quite
easy
she
stopped
her
faint
smile
checked
as
his
backward
movement
made
her
hands
drop
from
his
shoulders
and
that
what
you
proposing
to
me
that
you
and
i
should
do
like
the
rest
of
his
face
had
lost
its
comic
roundness
and
grown
harsh
and
dark
as
it
had
when
her
father
had
taken
her
away
from
him
at
opake
he
turned
on
his
heel
walked
the
length
of
the
room
and
halted
with
his
back
to
her
in
the
embrasure
of
the
window
there
he
paused
a
full
minute
his
hands
in
his
pockets
staring
out
at
the
perpetual
interweaving
of
motors
in
the
luminous
setting
of
the
square
then
he
turned
and
spoke
from
where
he
stood
look
here
undine
if
i
to
have
you
again
i
do
want
to
have
you
that
way
that
time
out
in
apex
when
everybody
in
the
place
was
against
me
and
i
was
down
and
out
you
stood
up
to
them
and
stuck
by
me
remember
that
walk
down
main
street
do
i
and
the
way
the
people
glared
and
hurried
by
and
how
you
kept
on
alongside
of
me
talking
and
laughing
and
looking
your
sunday
best
when
abner
spragg
came
out
to
opake
after
us
and
pulled
you
back
i
was
pretty
sore
at
your
deserting
but
i
came
to
see
it
was
natural
enough
you
were
only
a
spoilt
girl
used
to
having
everything
you
wanted
and
i
could
give
you
a
thing
then
and
the
folks
you
been
taught
to
believe
in
all
told
you
i
never
would
well
i
did
look
like
a
back
number
and
no
blame
to
you
for
thinking
so
i
used
to
say
it
to
myself
over
and
over
again
laying
awake
nights
and
totting
up
my
mistakes
and
then
there
were
days
when
the
wind
set
another
way
and
i
knew
i
pull
it
off
yet
and
i
thought
you
might
have
held
on
he
stopped
his
head
a
little
lowered
his
concentrated
gaze
on
her
flushed
face
well
anyhow
he
broke
out
you
were
my
wife
once
and
you
were
my
wife
first
and
if
you
want
to
come
back
you
got
to
come
that
way
not
slink
through
the
back
way
when
there
no
one
watching
but
walk
in
by
the
front
door
with
your
head
up
and
your
main
street
look
since
the
days
when
he
had
poured
out
to
her
his
great
projects
she
had
never
heard
him
make
so
long
a
speech
and
her
heart
as
she
listened
beat
with
a
new
joy
and
terror
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
great
moment
of
her
life
had
come
at
last
the
moment
all
her
minor
failures
and
successes
had
been
building
up
with
blind
indefatigable
hands
elmer
elmer
she
sobbed
out
she
expected
to
find
herself
in
his
arms
shut
in
and
shielded
from
all
her
troubles
but
he
stood
his
ground
across
the
room
immovable
is
it
yes
she
faltered
the
word
after
him
yes
are
you
going
to
marry
me
she
stared
bewildered
why
elmer
marry
you
you
forget
forget
what
that
you
do
want
to
give
up
what
you
got
how
can
i
such
things
are
not
done
out
here
why
i
a
catholic
and
the
catholic
church
she
broke
off
reading
the
end
in
his
face
but
later
perhaps
things
might
change
oh
elmer
if
only
you
stay
over
here
and
let
me
see
you
sometimes
yes
the
way
your
friends
see
each
other
we
differently
made
out
in
apex
when
i
want
that
sort
of
thing
i
go
down
to
north
fifth
street
for
it
she
paled
under
the
retort
but
her
heart
beat
high
with
it
what
he
asked
was
impossible
and
she
gloried
in
his
asking
it
feeling
her
power
she
tried
to
temporize
at
least
if
you
stayed
we
could
be
friends
i
should
feel
so
terribly
alone
he
laughed
impatiently
do
talk
magazine
stuff
to
me
undine
spragg
i
guess
we
want
each
other
the
same
way
only
our
ideas
are
different
you
got
all
muddled
living
out
here
among
a
lot
of
loafers
who
call
it
a
career
to
run
round
after
every
petticoat
i
got
my
job
out
at
home
and
i
belong
where
my
job
is
are
you
going
to
be
tied
to
business
all
your
life
her
smile
was
faintly
depreciatory
i
guess
business
is
tied
to
me
wall
street
acts
as
if
it
could
get
along
without
me
he
gave
his
shoulders
a
shake
and
moved
a
few
steps
nearer
see
here
undine
you
the
one
that
do
understand
if
i
was
to
sell
out
and
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
reading
art
magazines
in
a
pink
villa
i
would
do
what
you
asking
me
and
i
about
as
much
idea
of
dropping
business
as
you
have
of
taking
to
district
nursing
there
are
things
a
man
does
do
i
understand
why
your
husband
wo
sell
those
tapestries
till
he
got
to
his
ancestors
are
his
business
wall
street
mine
he
paused
and
they
silently
faced
each
other
undine
made
no
attempt
to
approach
him
she
understood
that
if
he
yielded
it
would
be
only
to
recover
his
advantage
and
deepen
her
feeling
of
defeat
she
put
out
her
hand
and
took
up
the
sunshade
she
had
dropped
on
entering
i
suppose
it
then
she
said
you
have
got
the
nerve
the
nerve
for
what
to
come
where
you
belong
with
me
she
laughed
a
little
and
then
sighed
she
wished
he
would
come
nearer
or
look
at
her
differently
she
felt
under
his
cool
eye
no
more
compelling
than
a
woman
of
wax
in
a
how
could
i
get
a
divorce
with
my
religion
why
you
were
born
a
baptist
were
you
that
where
you
used
to
attend
church
when
i
waited
round
the
corner
sunday
mornings
with
one
of
old
hober
buggies
they
both
laughed
and
he
went
on
if
come
along
home
with
me
i
see
you
get
your
divorce
all
right
who
cares
what
they
do
over
here
you
an
american
ai
you
what
you
want
is
the
article
she
listened
discouraged
yet
fascinated
by
his
sturdy
inaccessibility
to
all
her
arguments
and
objections
he
knew
what
he
wanted
saw
his
road
before
him
and
acknowledged
no
obstacles
her
defense
was
drawn
from
reasons
he
did
not
understand
or
based
on
difficulties
that
did
not
exist
for
him
and
gradually
she
felt
herself
yielding
to
the
steady
pressure
of
his
will
yet
the
reasons
he
brushed
away
came
back
with
redoubled
tenacity
whenever
he
paused
long
enough
for
her
to
picture
the
consequences
of
what
he
exacted
you
do
know
you
do
understand
she
kept
repeating
but
she
knew
that
his
ignorance
was
part
of
his
terrible
power
and
that
it
was
hopeless
to
try
to
make
him
feel
the
value
of
what
he
was
asking
her
to
give
up
see
here
undine
he
said
slowly
as
if
he
measured
her
resistance
though
he
could
fathom
it
i
guess
it
had
better
be
yes
or
no
right
here
it
ai
going
to
do
either
of
us
any
good
to
drag
this
thing
out
if
you
want
to
come
back
to
me
come
if
you
do
we
shake
hands
on
it
now
i
due
in
apex
for
a
directors
meeting
on
the
twentieth
and
as
it
is
i
have
to
cable
for
a
special
to
get
me
out
there
no
no
do
cry
it
ai
that
kind
of
a
story
but
i
have
a
deck
suite
for
you
on
the
semantic
if
you
sail
with
me
the
day
after
xlvi
in
the
great
library
of
a
private
hotel
overlooking
one
of
the
new
quarters
of
paris
paul
marvell
stood
listlessly
gazing
out
into
the
twilight
the
trees
were
budding
symmetrically
along
the
avenue
below
and
paul
looking
down
saw
between
windows
and
a
pair
of
tall
iron
gates
with
gilt
ornaments
the
marble
curb
of
a
drive
and
bands
of
spring
flowers
set
in
turf
he
was
now
a
big
boy
of
nearly
nine
who
went
to
a
fashionable
private
school
and
he
had
come
home
that
day
for
the
easter
holidays
he
had
not
been
back
since
christmas
and
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
seen
the
new
hotel
which
his
had
bought
and
in
which
and
moffatt
had
hastily
established
themselves
a
few
weeks
earlier
on
their
return
from
a
flying
trip
to
america
they
were
always
coming
and
going
during
the
two
years
since
their
marriage
they
had
been
perpetually
dashing
over
to
new
york
and
back
or
rushing
down
to
rome
or
up
to
the
engadine
paul
never
knew
where
they
were
except
when
a
telegram
announced
that
they
were
going
somewhere
else
he
did
not
even
know
that
there
was
any
method
of
communication
between
mothers
and
sons
less
laconic
than
that
of
the
electric
wire
and
once
when
a
boy
at
school
asked
him
if
his
mother
often
wrote
he
had
answered
in
all
sincerity
oh
yes
i
got
a
telegram
last
week
he
had
been
almost
sure
as
sure
as
he
ever
was
of
anything
that
he
should
find
her
at
home
when
he
arrived
but
a
message
for
she
had
time
to
telegraph
apprised
him
that
she
and
moffatt
had
run
down
to
deauville
to
look
at
a
house
they
thought
of
hiring
for
the
summer
they
were
taking
an
early
train
back
and
would
be
at
home
for
dinner
were
in
fact
having
a
lot
of
people
to
dine
it
was
just
what
he
ought
to
have
expected
and
had
been
used
to
ever
since
he
could
remember
and
generally
he
did
much
mind
especially
since
his
mother
had
become
moffatt
and
the
father
he
had
been
most
used
to
and
liked
best
had
abruptly
disappeared
from
his
life
but
the
new
hotel
was
big
and
strange
and
his
own
room
in
which
there
was
not
a
toy
or
a
book
or
one
of
his
dear
battered
relics
none
of
the
new
servants
they
were
always
new
could
find
his
things
or
think
where
they
had
been
put
seemed
the
loneliest
spot
in
the
whole
house
he
had
gone
up
there
after
his
solitary
luncheon
served
in
the
immense
marble
by
a
footman
on
the
same
scale
and
had
tried
to
occupy
himself
with
pasting
into
his
album
but
the
newness
and
sumptuousness
of
the
room
embarrassed
him
the
white
fur
rugs
and
brocade
chairs
seemed
maliciously
on
the
watch
for
smears
and
and
after
a
while
he
pushed
the
album
aside
and
began
to
roam
through
the
house
he
went
to
all
the
rooms
in
turn
his
mother
first
the
wonderful
lacy
bedroom
all
pale
silks
and
velvets
artful
mirrors
and
veiled
lamps
and
the
boudoir
as
big
as
a
with
pictures
he
would
have
liked
to
know
about
and
tables
and
cabinets
holding
things
he
was
afraid
to
touch
moffatt
rooms
came
next
they
were
soberer
and
darker
but
as
big
and
splendid
and
in
the
bedroom
on
the
brown
wall
hung
a
single
picture
the
portrait
of
a
boy
in
grey
velvet
that
interested
paul
most
of
all
the
boy
hand
rested
on
the
head
of
a
big
dog
and
he
looked
infinitely
noble
and
charming
and
yet
in
spite
of
the
dog
so
sad
and
lonely
that
he
too
might
have
come
home
that
very
day
to
a
strange
house
in
which
none
of
his
old
things
could
be
found
from
these
rooms
paul
wandered
downstairs
again
the
library
attracted
him
most
there
were
rows
and
rows
of
books
bound
in
dim
browns
and
golds
and
old
faded
reds
as
rich
as
velvet
they
all
looked
as
if
they
might
have
had
stories
in
them
as
splendid
as
their
bindings
but
the
bookcases
were
closed
with
gilt
trellising
and
when
paul
reached
up
to
open
one
a
servant
told
him
that
moffatt
secretary
kept
them
locked
because
the
books
were
too
valuable
to
be
taken
down
this
seemed
to
make
the
library
as
strange
as
the
rest
of
the
house
and
he
passed
on
to
the
ballroom
at
the
back
through
its
closed
doors
he
heard
a
sound
of
hammering
and
when
he
tried
the
a
servant
passing
with
a
of
glasses
told
him
that
they
had
finished
and
would
let
anybody
in
the
mysterious
pronoun
somehow
increased
paul
sense
of
isolation
and
he
went
on
to
the
steering
his
way
prudently
between
the
gold
and
shining
tables
and
wondering
whether
the
wigged
and
corseleted
heroes
on
the
walls
represented
moffatt
ancestors
and
why
if
they
did
he
looked
so
little
like
them
the
beyond
was
more
amusing
because
busy
servants
were
already
laying
the
long
table
it
was
too
early
for
the
florist
and
the
centre
of
the
table
was
empty
but
down
the
sides
were
gold
baskets
heaped
with
pulpy
summer
strawberries
and
big
blushing
nectarines
between
them
stood
crystal
decanters
with
red
and
yellow
wine
and
little
dishes
full
of
sweets
and
against
the
walls
were
sideboards
with
great
pieces
of
gold
and
silver
ewers
and
urns
and
branching
candelabra
which
sprinkled
the
green
marble
walls
with
starlike
reflections
after
a
while
he
grew
tired
of
watching
the
coming
and
going
of
footmen
and
of
listening
to
the
butler
vociferated
orders
and
strayed
back
into
the
library
the
habit
of
solitude
had
given
him
a
passion
for
the
printed
page
and
if
he
could
have
found
a
book
anywhere
any
kind
of
a
book
he
would
have
forgotten
the
long
hours
and
the
empty
house
but
the
tables
in
the
library
held
only
massive
unused
inkstands
and
immense
immaculate
blotters
not
a
single
volume
had
slipped
its
golden
prison
his
loneliness
had
grown
overwhelming
and
he
suddenly
thought
of
heeny
clippings
his
mother
alarmed
by
an
insidious
gain
in
weight
had
brought
the
masseuse
back
from
new
york
with
her
and
heeny
with
her
old
black
bag
and
waterproof
was
established
in
one
of
the
grand
bedrooms
lined
with
mirrors
she
had
been
loud
in
her
joy
at
seeing
her
little
friend
that
morning
but
four
years
had
passed
since
their
last
parting
and
her
personality
had
grown
remote
to
him
he
saw
too
many
people
and
they
too
often
disappeared
and
were
replaced
by
others
his
scattered
affections
had
ended
by
concentrating
themselves
on
the
charming
image
of
the
gentleman
he
called
his
french
father
and
since
his
french
father
had
vanished
no
one
else
seemed
to
matter
much
to
him
oh
well
heeny
had
said
discerning
the
reluctance
under
his
civil
greeting
i
guess
you
as
strange
here
as
i
am
and
we
both
pretty
strange
to
each
other
you
just
go
and
look
round
and
see
what
a
lovely
home
your
ma
got
to
live
in
and
when
you
get
tired
of
that
come
up
here
to
me
and
i
give
you
a
look
at
my
clippings
the
word
woke
a
train
of
dormant
associations
and
paul
saw
himself
seated
on
a
dingy
carpet
between
two
familiar
taciturn
old
presences
while
he
rummaged
in
the
depths
of
a
bag
stuffed
with
strips
of
newspaper
he
found
heeny
sitting
in
a
pink
her
bonnet
perched
on
a
electric
lamp
and
her
numerous
implements
spread
out
on
an
immense
pink
vague
as
his
recollection
of
her
was
she
gave
him
at
once
a
sense
of
reassurance
that
nothing
else
in
the
house
conveyed
and
after
he
had
examined
all
her
scissors
and
pastes
and
he
turned
to
the
bag
which
stood
on
the
carpet
at
her
feet
as
if
she
were
waiting
for
a
train
my
my
she
said
do
you
want
to
get
into
that
again
how
you
used
to
hunt
in
it
for
taffy
to
be
sure
when
your
pa
brought
you
up
to
grandma
spragg
o
saturdays
well
i
afraid
there
ai
any
taffy
in
it
now
but
there
piles
and
piles
of
lovely
new
clippings
you
ai
seen
my
papa
he
paused
his
hand
among
the
strips
of
newspaper
my
papa
never
saw
my
grandma
spragg
he
never
went
to
america
never
went
to
america
your
pa
never
why
land
alive
heeny
gasped
a
blush
empurpling
her
large
warm
face
why
paul
marvell
do
you
remember
your
own
father
you
that
bear
his
name
she
exclaimed
the
boy
blushed
also
conscious
that
it
must
have
been
wrong
to
forget
and
yet
not
seeing
how
he
was
to
blame
that
one
died
a
long
long
time
ago
did
he
i
was
thinking
of
my
french
father
he
explained
oh
mercy
ejaculated
heeny
and
as
if
to
cut
the
conversation
short
she
stooped
over
creaking
like
a
ship
and
thrust
her
plump
strong
hand
into
the
bag
here
now
just
you
look
at
these
clippings
i
guess
you
find
a
lot
in
them
about
your
where
do
they
come
from
why
out
of
the
papers
of
course
she
added
in
response
to
paul
enquiry
you
oughter
start
a
yourself
you
plenty
old
enough
you
could
make
a
beauty
just
about
your
ma
with
her
picture
pasted
in
the
front
and
another
about
moffatt
and
his
collections
there
one
i
cut
out
the
other
day
that
says
he
the
greatest
collector
in
america
paul
listened
fascinated
he
had
the
feeling
that
clippings
aside
from
their
great
intrinsic
interest
might
furnish
him
the
clue
to
many
things
he
did
understand
and
that
nobody
had
ever
had
time
to
explain
to
him
his
mother
marriages
for
instance
he
was
sure
there
was
a
great
deal
to
find
out
about
them
but
she
always
said
i
tell
you
all
about
it
when
i
come
back
and
when
she
came
back
it
was
invariably
to
rush
off
somewhere
else
so
he
had
remained
without
a
key
to
her
transitions
and
had
had
to
take
for
granted
numberless
things
that
seemed
to
have
no
parallel
in
the
experience
of
the
other
boys
he
knew
here
here
it
is
said
heeny
adjusting
the
big
tortoiseshell
spectacles
she
had
taken
to
wearing
and
reading
out
in
a
slow
chant
that
seemed
to
paul
to
come
out
of
some
lost
remoteness
of
his
infancy
is
reported
in
london
that
the
price
paid
by
elmer
moffatt
for
the
celebrated
grey
boy
is
the
largest
sum
ever
given
for
a
vandyck
since
moffatt
began
to
buy
extensively
it
is
estimated
in
art
circles
that
values
have
gone
up
at
least
per
cent
but
the
price
of
the
grey
boy
did
not
interest
paul
and
he
said
a
little
impatiently
i
rather
hear
about
my
mother
to
be
sure
you
would
you
wait
now
heeny
made
another
dive
and
again
began
to
spread
her
clippings
on
her
lap
like
cards
on
a
big
black
table
here
one
about
her
last
portrait
no
here
a
better
one
about
her
pearl
necklace
the
one
moffatt
gave
her
last
christmas
necklace
which
was
formerly
the
property
of
an
austrian
archduchess
is
composed
of
five
hundred
perfectly
matched
pearls
that
took
thirty
years
to
collect
it
is
estimated
among
dealers
in
precious
stones
that
since
moffatt
began
to
buy
the
price
of
pearls
has
gone
up
over
fifty
per
cent
even
this
did
not
fix
paul
attention
he
wanted
to
hear
about
his
mother
and
moffatt
and
not
about
their
things
and
he
did
quite
know
how
to
frame
his
question
but
heeny
looked
kindly
at
him
and
he
tried
why
is
mother
married
to
moffatt
now
why
you
must
know
that
much
paul
heeny
again
looked
warm
and
worried
she
married
to
him
because
she
got
a
divorce
that
why
and
suddenly
she
had
another
inspiration
did
she
ever
send
you
over
any
of
those
splendid
clippings
that
came
out
the
time
they
were
married
why
i
declare
that
a
shame
but
i
must
have
some
of
right
here
she
dived
again
shuffled
sorted
and
pulled
out
a
long
discoloured
strip
i
carried
this
round
with
me
ever
since
and
so
many
wanted
to
read
it
it
all
torn
she
smoothed
out
the
paper
and
began

at

as
moffatt
said
last
night
before
he
and
his
bride
jumped
onto
their
special
every
record
has
been
broken
it
was
just
six
months
ago
yesterday
that
the
present
moffatt
came
to
reno
to
look
for
her
divorce
owing
to
a
delayed
train
her
counsel
was
late
yesterday
in
receiving
some
necessary
papers
and
it
was
feared
the
decision
would
have
to
be
held
over
but
judge
toomey
who
is
a
personal
friend
of
moffatt
held
a
night
session
and
rushed
it
through
so
that
the
happy
couple
could
have
the
knot
tied
and
board
their
special
in
time
for
moffatt
to
spend
thanksgiving
in
new
york
with
her
aged
parents
the
hearing
began
at
seven
ten
and
at
eight
the
bridal
couple
were
steaming
out
of
the
station
the
trial
chelles
who
wore
copper
velvet
and
sables
gave
evidence
as
to
the
brutality
of
her
french
husband
but
she
had
to
talk
fast
as
time
pressed
and
judge
toomey
wrote
the
entry
at
top
speed
and
then
jumped
into
a
motor
with
the
happy
couple
and
drove
to
the
justice
of
the
peace
where
he
acted
as
best
man
to
the
bridegroom
the
latter
is
said
to
be
one
of
the
six
wealthiest
men
east
of

to
the
bride

and

avenue
which
is
an
exact
copy
of
the
pitti
palace
florence
they
plan
to
spend
their
springs
in
france
heeny
drew
a
long
breath
folded
the
paper
and
took
off
her
spectacles
there
she
said
with
a
benignant
smile
and
a
tap
on
paul
cheek
now
you
see
how
it
all
happened
paul
was
not
sure
he
did
but
he
made
no
answer
his
mind
was
too
full
of
troubled
thoughts
in
the
dazzling
description
of
his
mother
latest
nuptials
one
fact
alone
stood
out
for
him
that
she
had
said
things
that
were
true
of
his
french
father
something
he
had
in
her
and
averted
his
frightened
thoughts
from
took
his
little
heart
in
an
iron
grasp
she
said
things
that
were
true
that
was
what
he
had
always
feared
to
find
out
she
had
got
up
and
said
before
a
lot
of
people
things
that
were
awfully
false
about
his
dear
french
father
the
sound
of
a
motor
turning
in
at
the
gates
made
heeny
exclaim
here
they
are
and
a
moment
later
paul
heard
his
mother
calling
to
him
he
got
up
reluctantly
and
stood
wavering
till
he
felt
astonished
eye
upon
him
then
he
heard
moffatt
jovial
shout
of
paul
marvell
ahoy
there
and
roused
himself
to
run
downstairs
as
he
reached
the
landing
he
saw
that
the
ballroom
doors
were
open
and
all
the
lustres
lit
his
mother
and
moffatt
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
shining
floor
looking
up
at
the
walls
and
paul
heart
gave
a
wondering
bound
for
there
set
in
great
gilt
panels
were
the
tapestries
that
had
always
hung
in
the
gallery
at
saint
desert
well
senator
it
feels
good
to
shake
your
fist
again
his
said
taking
him
in
a
friendly
grasp
and
his
mother
who
looked
handsomer
and
taller
and
more
splendidly
dressed
than
ever
exclaimed
mercy
how
they
cut
his
hair
before
she
bent
to
kiss
him
oh
mother
mother
he
burst
out
feeling
between
his
mother
face
and
the
others
hardly
less
familiar
on
the
walls
that
he
was
really
at
home
again
and
not
in
a
strange
house
gracious
how
you
squeeze
she
protested
loosening
his
arms
but
you
look
splendidly
and
how
you
grown
she
turned
away
from
him
and
began
to
inspect
the
tapestries
critically
somehow
they
look
smaller
here
she
said
with
a
tinge
of
disappointment
moffatt
gave
a
slight
laugh
and
walked
slowly
down
the
room
as
if
to
study
its
effect
as
he
turned
back
his
wife
said
i
did
think
you
ever
get
them
he
laughed
again
more
complacently
well
i
do
know
as
i
ever
should
have
if
general
arlington
had
happened
to
bust
up
they
both
smiled
and
paul
seeing
his
mother
softened
face
stole
his
hand
in
hers
and
began
mother
i
took
a
prize
in
composition
did
you
you
must
tell
me
about
it
no
i
really
must
rush
off
now
and
dress
i
have
even
placed
the
she
freed
her
hand
and
as
she
turned
to
go
paul
heard
moffatt
say
ca
you
ever
give
him
a
minute
time
undine
she
made
no
answer
but
sailed
through
the
door
with
her
head
high
as
she
did
when
anything
annoyed
her
and
paul
and
his
stood
alone
in
the
illuminated
moffatt
smiled
at
the
little
boy
and
then
turned
back
to
the
contemplation
of
the
hangings
i
guess
you
know
where
those
come
from
do
you
he
asked
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
oh
yes
paul
answered
eagerly
with
a
hope
he
dared
not
utter
that
since
the
tapestries
were
there
his
french
father
might
be
coming
too
you
a
smart
boy
to
remember
them
i
do
suppose
you
ever
thought
you
see
them
here
i
do
know
said
paul
embarrassed
well
i
guess
you
would
have
if
their
owner
had
been
in
a
pretty
tight
place
it
was
like
drawing
teeth
for
him
to
let
them
go
paul
flushed
up
and
again
the
iron
grasp
was
on
his
heart
he
had
hitherto
actually
disliked
moffatt
who
was
always
in
a
good
humour
and
seemed
less
busy
and
than
his
mother
but
at
that
instant
he
felt
a
rage
of
hate
for
him
he
turned
away
and
burst
into
tears
why
hullo
old
chap
why
what
up
moffatt
was
on
his
knees
beside
the
boy
and
the
arms
embracing
him
were
firm
and
friendly
but
paul
for
the
life
of
him
could
answer
he
could
only
sob
and
sob
as
the
great
surges
of
loneliness
broke
over
him
is
it
because
your
mother
had
time
for
you
well
she
like
that
you
know
and
you
and
i
have
got
to
lump
it
moffatt
continued
getting
to
his
feet
he
stood
looking
down
at
the
boy
with
a
queer
smile
if
we
two
chaps
stick
together
it
wo
be
so
bad
we
can
keep
each
other
warm
do
you
see
i
like
you
first
rate
you
know
when
you
big
enough
i
mean
to
put
you
in
my
business
and
it
looks
as
if
one
of
these
days
you
be
the
richest
boy
in
america
the
lamps
were
lit
the
vases
full
of
flowers
the
assembled
on
the
landing
and
in
the
vestibule
below
when
undine
descended
to
the
as
she
passed
the
ballroom
door
she
glanced
in
approvingly
at
the
tapestries
they
really
looked
better
than
she
had
been
willing
to
admit
they
made
her
ballroom
the
handsomest
in
paris
but
something
had
put
her
out
on
the
way
up
from
deauville
and
the
simplest
way
of
easing
her
nerves
had
been
to
affect
indifference
to
the
tapestries
now
she
had
quite
recovered
her
good
humour
and
as
she
glanced
down
the
list
of
guests
she
was
awaiting
she
said
to
herself
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
that
she
was
glad
she
had
put
on
her
rubies
for
the
first
time
since
her
marriage
to
moffatt
she
was
about
to
receive
in
her
house
the
people
she
most
wished
to
see
there
the
beginnings
had
been
a
little
difficult
their
first
attempt
in
new
york
was
so
unpromising
that
she
feared
they
might
not
be
able
to
live
down
the
sensational
details
of
their
reunion
and
had
insisted
on
her
husband
taking
her
back
to
paris
but
her
apprehensions
were
unfounded
it
was
only
necessary
to
give
people
the
time
to
pretend
they
had
forgotten
and
already
they
were
all
pretending
beautifully
the
french
world
had
of
course
held
out
longest
it
had
strongholds
she
might
never
capture
but
already
seceders
were
beginning
to
show
themselves
and
her
that
evening
was
graced
with
the
names
of
an
authentic
duke
and
a
not
countess
in
addition
of
course
she
had
the
shallums
the
chauncey
ellings
may
beringer
dicky
bowles
walsingham
popple
and
the
rest
of
the
new
york
frequenters
of
the
nouveau
luxe
she
had
even
at
the
last
minute
had
the
amusement
of
adding
peter
van
degen
to
their
number
in
the
evening
there
were
to
be
spanish
dancing
and
russian
singing
and
dicky
bowles
had
promised
her
a
grand
duke
for
her
next
dinner
if
she
could
secure
the
new
tenor
who
always
refused
to
sing
in
private
houses
even
now
however
she
was
not
always
happy
she
had
everything
she
wanted
but
she
still
felt
at
times
that
there
were
other
things
she
might
want
if
she
knew
about
them
and
there
had
been
moments
lately
when
she
had
had
to
confess
to
herself
that
moffatt
did
not
fit
into
the
picture
at
first
she
had
been
dazzled
by
his
success
and
subdued
by
his
authority
he
had
given
her
all
she
had
ever
wished
for
and
more
than
she
had
ever
dreamed
of
having
he
had
made
up
to
her
for
all
her
failures
and
blunders
and
there
were
hours
when
she
still
felt
his
dominion
and
exulted
in
it
but
there
were
others
when
she
saw
his
defects
and
was
irritated
by
them
when
his
loudness
and
redness
his
misplaced
joviality
his
familiarity
with
the
servants
his
alternating
swagger
and
ceremony
with
her
friends
jarred
on
perceptions
that
had
developed
in
her
unawares
now
and
then
she
caught
herself
thinking
that
his
two
predecessors
who
were
gradually
becoming
merged
in
her
memory
would
have
said
this
or
that
differently
behaved
otherwise
in
such
and
such
a
case
and
the
comparison
was
almost
always
to
disadvantage
this
evening
however
she
thought
of
him
indulgently
she
was
pleased
with
his
clever
stroke
in
capturing
the
saint
desert
tapestries
which
general
arlington
sudden
bankruptcy
and
a
fresh
gambling
scandal
of
hubert
had
compelled
their
owner
to
part
with
she
knew
that
raymond
de
chelles
had
told
the
dealers
he
would
sell
his
tapestries
to
anyone
but
elmer
moffatt
or
a
buyer
acting
for
him
and
it
amused
her
to
think
that
thanks
to
elmer
astuteness
they
were
under
her
roof
after
all
and
that
raymond
and
all
his
clan
were
by
this
time
aware
of
it
these
facts
disposed
her
favourably
toward
her
husband
and
deepened
the
sense
of
with
which
according
to
her
invariable
habit
she
walked
up
to
the
mirror
above
the
mantelpiece
and
studied
the
image
it
reflected
she
was
still
lost
in
this
pleasing
contemplation
when
her
husband
entered
looking
stouter
and
redder
than
ever
in
evening
clothes
that
were
a
little
too
tight
his
shirt
front
was
as
glossy
as
his
baldness
and
in
his
buttonhole
he
wore
the
red
ribbon
bestowed
on
him
for
waiving
his
claim
to
a
velasquez
that
was
wanted
for
the
louvre
he
carried
a
newspaper
in
his
hand
and
stood
looking
about
the
room
with
a
complacent
eye
well
i
guess
this
is
all
right
he
said
and
she
answered
briefly
do
forget
you
to
take
down
madame
de
follerive
and
for
sake
do
call
her
why
she
is
one
ai
she
he
returned
i
wish
you
put
that
newspaper
away
she
continued
his
habit
of
leaving
old
newspapers
about
the
annoyed
her
oh
that
reminds
me
instead
of
obeying
her
he
unfolded
the
paper
i
brought
it
in
to
show
you
something
jim
driscoll
been
appointed
ambassador
to
england
jim
driscoll
she
caught
up
the
paper
and
stared
at
the
paragraph
he
pointed
to
jim
driscoll
that
pitiful
nonentity
with
his
stout
mistrustful
commonplace
wife
it
seemed
extraordinary
that
the
government
should
have
hunted
up
such
insignificant
people
and
immediately
she
had
a
great
vague
vision
of
the
splendours
they
were
going
to
all
the
banquets
and
ceremonies
and
precedences
i
should
say
she
want
to
with
so
few
jewels
she
dropped
the
paper
and
turned
to
her
husband
if
you
had
a
spark
of
ambition
the
kind
of
thing
you
try
for
you
could
have
got
it
just
as
easily
as
not
he
laughed
and
thrust
his
thumbs
in
his
waistcoat
armholes
with
the
gesture
she
disliked
as
it
happens
it
about
the
one
thing
i
could
you
could
why
not
because
you
divorced
they
wo
have
divorced
ambassadresses
they
wo
why
not
i
like
to
know
well
i
guess
the
court
ladies
are
afraid
there
be
too
many
pretty
women
in
the
embassies
he
answered
jocularly
she
burst
into
an
angry
laugh
and
the
blood
flamed
up
into
her
face
i
never
heard
of
anything
so
insulting
she
cried
as
if
the
rule
had
been
invented
to
humiliate
her
there
was
a
noise
of
motors
backing
and
advancing
in
the
court
and
she
heard
the
first
voices
on
the
stairs
she
turned
to
give
herself
a
last
look
in
the
glass
saw
the
blaze
of
her
rubies
the
glitter
of
her
hair
and
remembered
the
brilliant
names
on
her
list
but
under
all
the
dazzle
a
tiny
black
cloud
remained
she
had
learned
that
there
was
something
she
could
never
get
something
that
neither
beauty
nor
influence
nor
millions
could
ever
buy
for
her
she
could
never
be
an
ambassador
wife
and
as
she
advanced
to
welcome
her
first
guests
she
said
to
herself
that
it
was
the
one
part
she
was
really
made
for
the
end
