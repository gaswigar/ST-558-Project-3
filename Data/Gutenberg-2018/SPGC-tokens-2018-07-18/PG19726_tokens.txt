i
always
wanted
to
write
but
not
until
i
discovered
the
old
pulp
magazines
at
the
age
of
sixteen
did
this
general
desire
become
a
specific
urge
to
write
adventures
i
took
a
lot
of
detours
on
the
way
i
discovered
in
its
golden
age
the
age
of
kuttner
moore
leigh
brackett
ed
hamilton
and
jack
vance
but
while
i
was
still
collecting
rejection
slips
for
my
early
efforts
the
fashion
changed
adventures
on
faraway
worlds
and
strange
dimensions
went
out
of
fashion
and
the
new
look
in
emphasis
on
the
came
in
so
my
first
stories
were
straight
and
i
not
trying
to
put
down
that
kind
of
story
it
has
its
place
by
and
large
the
kind
of
which
makes
tomorrow
headlines
as
near
as
this
morning
coffee
has
enlarged
popular
awareness
of
the
modern
miraculous
world
of
science
we
live
in
it
has
helped
generations
of
young
people
feel
at
ease
with
a
rapidly
changing
world
but
fashions
change
old
loves
return
and
now
that
sputniks
clutter
up
the
sky
with
new
and
unfamiliar
moons
the
readers
of
are
willing
to
wait
for
tomorrow
to
read
tomorrow
headlines
once
again
i
think
there
is
a
place
a
wish
a
need
and
hunger
for
the
wonder
and
color
of
the
world
way
out
the
world
beyond
the
stars
the
world
we
live
to
see
that
is
why
i
wrote
the

through

marion
zimmer
bradley
chapter
one
beyond
the
spaceport
gates
the
men
of
the
kharsa
were
hunting
down
a
thief
i
heard
the
shrill
cries
the
of
feet
in
strides
just
a
little
too
long
and
loping
to
be
human
raising
echoes
all
down
the
dark
and
dusty
streets
leading
up
to
the
main
square
but
the
square
itself
lay
empty
in
the
crimson
noon
of
wolf
overhead
the
dim
red
ember
of
phi
coronis
wolf
old
and
dying
sun
gave
out
a
pale
and
heatless
light
the
pair
of
spaceforce
guards
at
the
gates
wearing
the
black
leathers
of
the
terran
empire
shockers
holstered
at
their
belts
were
drowsing
under
the
arched
gateway
where
the
emblem
proclaimed
the
domain
of
terra
one
of
them
a
youngster
only
a
few
weeks
out
from
earth
cocked
an
inquisitive
ear
at
the
cries
and
scuffling
feet
then
jerked
his
head
at
me
hey
cargill
you
can
talk
their
lingo
what
going
on
out
there
i
stepped
out
past
the
gateway
to
listen
there
was
still
no
one
to
be
seen
in
the
square
it
lay
white
and
windswept
a
barricade
of
emptiness
to
one
side
the
spaceport
and
the
white
skyscraper
of
the
terran
headquarters
and
at
the
other
side
the
clutter
of
low
buildings
the
the
little
spaceport
cafe
smelling
of
coffee
and
and
the
dark
opening
mouths
of
streets
that
rambled
down
into
the
kharsa
the
old
town
the
native
quarter
but
i
was
alone
in
the
square
with
the
shrill
cries
closer
now
raising
echoes
from
the
enclosing
walls
and
the
loping
of
many
feet
down
one
of
the
dirty
streets
then
i
saw
him
running
dodging
a
hail
of
stones
flying
round
his
head
someone
or
something
small
and
cloaked
and
agile
behind
him
the
mob
howled
and
threw
stones
i
could
not
yet
understand
the
cries
but
they
were
out
for
blood
and
i
knew
it
i
said
briefly
trouble
coming
just
before
the
mob
spilled
out
into
the
square
the
fleeing
dwarf
stared
about
wildly
for
an
instant
his
head
jerking
from
side
to
side
so
rapidly
that
it
was
impossible
to
get
even
a
fleeting
impression
of
his
face
human
or
nonhuman
familiar
or
bizarre
then
like
a
pellet
loosed
from
its
sling
he
made
straight
for
the
gateway
and
safety
and
behind
him
the
loping
mob
yelled
and
howled
and
came
pouring
over
half
the
square
just
half
then
by
that
sudden
intuition
which
permeates
even
the
most
crazed
mob
with
some
semblance
of
reason
they
came
to
a
ragged
halt
heads
turning
from
side
to
side
i
stepped
up
on
the
lower
step
of
the
headquarters
building
and
looked
them
over
most
of
them
were
the
furred
nonhumans
of
the
kharsa
and
not
the
better
class
their
fur
was
unkempt
their
tails
naked
with
filth
and
disease
their
leather
aprons
hung
in
tatters
one
or
two
in
the
crowd
were
humans
the
dregs
of
the
kharsa
but
the
emblem
blazoned
across
the
spaceport
gates
sobered
even
the
wildest
somewhat
they
milled
and
shifted
uneasily
in
their
half
of
the
square
for
a
moment
i
did
not
see
where
their
quarry
had
gone
then
i
saw
him
crouched
not
four
feet
from
me
in
a
patch
of
shadow
simultaneously
the
mob
saw
him
huddled
just
beyond
the
gateway
and
a
howl
of
frustration
and
rage
went
ringing
round
the
square
someone
threw
a
stone
it
zipped
over
my
head
narrowly
missing
me
and
landed
at
the
feet
of
the
guard
he
jerked
his
head
up
and
gestured
with
the
shocker
which
had
suddenly
come
unholstered
the
gesture
should
have
been
enough
on
wolf
terran
law
has
been
written
in
blood
and
fire
and
exploding
atoms
and
the
line
is
drawn
firm
and
clear
the
men
of
spaceforce
do
not
interfere
in
the
old
town
or
in
any
of
the
native
cities
but
when
violence
steps
over
the
threshold
passing
the
blazon
of
the
star
and
rocket
punishment
is
swift
and
terrible
the
threat
should
have
been
enough
instead
a
howl
of
abuse
went
up
from
the
crowd
son
of
the
ape
the
spaceforce
guards
were
shoulder
to
shoulder
behind
me
now
the
kid
looking
slightly
pale
called
out
get
inside
the
gates
cargill
if
i
have
to
shoot
the
older
man
motioned
him
to
silence
wait
cargill
he
called
i
nodded
to
show
that
i
heard
you
talk
their
lingo
tell
them
to
haul
off
damned
if
i
want
to
shoot
i
stepped
down
and
walked
into
the
open
square
across
the
crumbled
white
stones
toward
the
ragged
mob
even
with
two
armed
spaceforce
men
at
my
back
it
made
my
skin
crawl
but
i
flung
up
my
empty
hand
in
token
of
peace
take
your
mob
out
of
the
square
i
shouted
in
the
jargon
of
the
kharsa
this
territory
is
held
in
compact
of
peace
settle
your
quarrels
elsewhere
there
was
a
little
stirring
in
the
crowd
the
shock
of
being
addressed
in
their
own
tongue
instead
of
the
terran
standard
which
the
empire
has
forced
on
wolf
held
them
silent
for
a
minute
i
had
learned
that
long
ago
that
speaking
in
any
of
the
languages
of
wolf
would
give
me
a
minute
advantage
but
only
a
minute
then
one
of
the
mob
yelled
we
go
if
you
to
us
he
no
right
to
terran
sanctuary
i
walked
over
to
the
huddled
dwarf
miserably
trying
to
make
himself
smaller
against
the
wall
i
nudged
him
with
my
foot
get
up
who
are
you
the
hood
fell
away
from
his
face
as
he
twitched
to
his
feet
he
was
trembling
violently
in
the
shadow
of
the
hood
i
saw
a
furred
face
a
quivering
velvety
muzzle
and
great
soft
golden
eyes
which
held
intelligence
and
terror
what
have
you
done
ca
you
talk
he
held
out
the
tray
which
he
had
shielded
under
his
cloak
an
ordinary
peddler
tray
toys
sell
toys
children
you
got
i
shook
my
head
and
pushed
the
creature
away
with
only
a
glance
at
the
array
of
delicately
crafted
manikins
tiny
animals
prisms
and
crystal
whirligigs
you
better
get
out
of
here
scram
down
that
street
i
pointed
a
voice
from
the
crowd
shouted
again
and
it
had
a
very
ugly
sound
he
is
a
spy
of
nebran
the
dwarfish
nonhuman
gabbled
something
then
doubled
behind
me
i
saw
him
dodge
feint
in
the
direction
of
the
gates
then
as
the
crowd
surged
that
way
run
for
the
across
the
square
slipping
from
recess
to
recess
of
the
wall
a
hail
of
stones
went
flying
in
that
direction
the
little
dodged
into
the
then
there
was
a
hoarse
ah
aaah
of
terror
and
the
crowd
edged
away
surged
backward
the
next
minute
it
had
begun
to
melt
away
its
entity
dissolving
into
separate
creatures
slipping
into
the
side
alleys
and
the
dark
streets
that
disgorged
into
the
square
within
three
minutes
the
square
lay
empty
again
in
the
noon
the
kid
in
black
leather
let
his
breath
go
and
swore
slipping
his
shocker
into
its
holster
he
stared
and
demanded
profanely
where
the
little
fellow
go
who
knows
the
other
shrugged
probably
sneaked
into
one
of
the
alleys
did
you
see
where
he
went
cargill
i
came
slowly
back
to
the
gateway
to
me
it
had
seemed
that
he
ducked
into
the
and
vanished
into
thin
air
but
i
lived
on
wolf
long
enough
to
know
you
ca
trust
your
eyes
here
i
said
so
and
the
kid
swore
again
gulping
more
upset
than
he
wanted
to
admit
does
this
kind
of
thing
happen
often
all
the
time
his
companion
assured
him
soberly
with
a
sidewise
wink
at
me
i
did
return
the
wink
the
kid
would
let
it
drop
where
did
you
learn
their
lingo
mr
cargill
i
been
on
wolf
a
long
time
i
said
spun
on
my
heel
and
walked
toward
headquarters
i
tried
not
to
hear
but
their
voices
followed
me
anyhow
discreetly
lowered
but
not
lowered
enough
kid
do
you
know
who
he
is
that
cargill
of
the
secret
service
six
years
ago
he
was
the
best
man
in
intelligence
before
the
voice
lowered
another
decibel
and
then
there
was
the
kid
voice
asking
shaken
but
what
the
hell
happened
to
his
face
i
should
have
been
used
to
it
by
now
i
been
hearing
it
more
or
less
behind
my
back
for
six
years
well
if
my
luck
held
i
never
hear
it
again
i
strode
up
the
white
steps
of
the
skyscraper
to
finish
the
arrangements
that
would
take
me
away
from
wolf
forever
to
the
other
end
of
the
empire
to
the
other
end
of
the
galaxy
anywhere
so
long
as
i
need
not
wear
my
past
like
a
medallion
around
my
neck
or
blazoned
and
branded
on
what
was
left
of
my
ruined
face
chapter
two
the
terran
empire
has
set
its
blazon
on
four
hundred
planets
circling
more
than
three
hundred
suns
but
no
matter
what
the
color
of
the
sun
the
number
of
moons
overhead
or
the
geography
of
the
planet
once
you
step
inside
a
headquarters
building
you
are
on
earth
and
earth
would
be
alien
to
many
who
called
themselves
earthmen
judging
by
the
strangeness
i
always
felt
when
i
stepped
into
that
world
inside
the
skyscraper
i
heard
the
sound
of
my
steps
ringing
into
thin
resonance
along
the
marble
corridor
and
squinted
my
eyes
readjusting
them
painfully
to
the
cold
yellowness
of
the
lights
the
traffic
division
was
efficiency
made
insolent
in
glass
and
chrome
and
polished
steel
mirrors
and
windows
and
looming
electronic
clerical
machines
most
of
one
wall
was
taken
up
by
a
tv
monitor
which
gave
a
view
of
the
spaceport
a
vast
open
space
lighted
with
mercury
vapor
lamps
and
a
skyscraper
of
a
starship
littered
over
with
swarming
ants
the
process
crew
was
getting
the
big
ship
ready
for
skylift
tomorrow
morning
i
gave
it
a
second
and
then
a
third
look
be
on
it
when
it
lifted
turning
away
from
the
monitored
spaceport
i
watched
myself
stride
forward
in
the
mirrored
surfaces
that
were
everywhere
a
tall
man
a
lean
man
bleached
out
by
years
under
a
red
sun
and
deeply
scarred
on
both
cheeks
and
around
the
mouth
even
after
six
years
behind
a
desk
my
neat
business
clothes
suitable
for
an
earthman
with
a
desk
job
fit
quite
right
and
i
still
rose
unconsciously
on
the
balls
of
my
feet
approximating
the
lean
stooping
walk
of
a
from
the
coronis
plains
the
clerk
behind
the
sign
marked
transportation
was
a
little
rabbit
of
a
man
with
a
sunlamp
tan
barricaded
by
a
spaceport
of
desk
and
looking
as
if
he
liked
being
shut
up
there
he
looked
up
in
civil
inquiry
can
i
do
something
for
you
my
name
cargill
have
you
a
pass
for
me
he
stared
a
free
pass
aboard
a
starship
is
rare
except
for
professional
spacemen
which
i
obviously
was
let
me
check
my
records
he
hedged
and
punched
scanning
buttons
on
the
glassy
surface
shadows
came
and
went
and
i
saw
myself
a
tipsy
shadow
in
a
flurry
of
racing
colors
the
pattern
finally
stabilized
and
the
clerk
read
off
names
brill
cameron
ah
yes
cargill
race
andrew
department
transfer
transportation
is
that
you
i
admitted
it
and
he
started
punching
more
buttons
when
the
sound
of
the
name
made
connection
in
whatever
use
for
a
brain
he
stopped
with
his
hand
halfway
to
the
button
are
you
race
cargill
of
the
secret
service
sir
race
cargill
it
right
there
i
said
gesturing
wearily
at
the
projected
pattern
under
the
glassy
surface
why
i
thought
i
mean
everybody
took
it
for
granted
that
is
i
heard
you
thought
cargill
had
been
killed
a
long
time
ago
because
his
name
never
turned
up
in
news
dispatches
any
more
i
grinned
sourly
seeing
my
image
dissolve
in
blurring
shadows
and
feeling
the
scar
on
my
mouth
draw
up
to
make
the
grin
hideous
i
cargill
all
right
i
been
up
on
floor
for
six
years
holding
down
a
desk
any
clerk
could
handle
you
for
instance
he
gaped
he
was
a
rabbit
of
a
man
who
had
never
stepped
out
of
the
safe
familiar
boundaries
of
the
terran
trade
city
you
mean
the
man
who
went
to
charin
in
disguise
and
routed
out
the
lisse
the
man
who
scouted
the
black
ridge
and
shainsa
and
you
been
working
at
a
desk
upstairs
all
these
years
it
hard
to
believe
sir
my
mouth
twitched
it
had
been
hard
for
me
to
believe
while
i
was
doing
it
the
pass
right
away
sir
he
punched
buttons
and
a
printed
chip
of
plastic
extruded
from
a
slot
on
the
desk
top
your
fingerprint
please
he
pressed
my
finger
into
the
surface
of
the
plastic
indelibly
recording
the
print
waited
a
moment
for
it
to
harden
then
laid
the
chip
in
the
slot
of
a
pneumatic
tube
i
heard
it
whoosh
away
they
check
your
fingerprint
against
that
when
you
board
the
ship
skylift
is
till
dawn
but
you
can
go
aboard
as
soon
as
the
process
crew
finishes
with
her
he
glanced
at
the
monitor
screen
where
the
swarming
crew
were
still
doing
inexplicable
things
to
the
immobile
spacecraft
it
will
be
another
hour
or
two
where
are
you
going
mr
cargill
some
planet
in
the
hyades
cluster
vainwal
i
think
something
like
that
what
it
like
there
how
should
i
know
i
never
been
there
either
i
only
knew
that
vainwal
had
a
red
sun
and
that
the
terran
legate
could
use
a
trained
intelligence
officer
and
pin
him
down
to
a
desk
there
was
respect
and
even
envy
in
the
little
man
voice
could
i
buy
you
a
drink
before
you
go
aboard
mr
cargill
thanks
but
i
have
a
few
loose
ends
to
tie
up
i
did
but
i
was
damned
if
i
spend
my
last
hour
on
wolf
under
the
eyes
of
a
deskbound
rabbit
who
preferred
his
adventure
safely
secondhand
but
after
i
left
the
office
and
the
building
i
almost
wished
taken
him
up
on
it
it
would
be
at
least
an
hour
before
i
could
board
the
starship
with
nothing
to
do
but
hash
over
old
memories
better
forgotten
the
sun
was
lower
now
phi
coronis
is
a
dim
star
a
dying
star
and
once
past
the
crimson
zenith
of
noon
its
light
slants
into
a
long
twilight
four
of
wolf
five
moons
were
clustered
in
a
pale
bouquet
overhead
mingling
thin
violet
moonlight
into
the
crimson
dusk
the
shadows
were
blue
and
purple
in
the
empty
square
as
i
walked
across
the
stones
and
stood
looking
down
one
of
the
side
streets
a
few
steps
and
i
was
in
an
untidy
slum
which
might
have
been
on
another
world
from
the
neat
bright
trade
city
which
lay
west
of
the
spaceport
the
kharsa
was
alive
and
reeking
with
the
sounds
and
smells
of
human
and
life
a
naked
child
diminutive
and
darted
between
two
of
the
chinked
and
disappeared
spilling
fragile
laughter
like
breaking
glass
a
little
beast
half
snake
and
half
cat
crawled
across
a
roof
spread
leathery
wings
and
flapped
to
the
ground
the
sour
pungent
reek
of
incense
from
the
open
made
my
nostrils
twitch
and
a
hulked
form
inside
not
human
cast
me
a
surly
green
glare
as
i
passed
i
turned
retracing
my
steps
there
was
no
danger
of
course
so
close
to
the
trade
city
even
on
such
planets
as
wolf
terra
laws
are
respected
within
earshot
of
their
gates
but
there
had
been
rioting
here
and
in
charin
during
the
last
month
after
the
display
of
mob
violence
this
afternoon
a
lone
terran
unarmed
might
turn
up
as
a
solitary
corpse
flung
on
the
steps
of
the
hq
building
there
had
been
a
time
when
i
had
walked
alone
from
shainsa
to
the
polar
colony
i
had
known
how
to
melt
into
this
kind
of
night
shabby
and
inconspicuous
a
worn
shirtcloak
hunched
round
my
shoulders
weaponless
except
for
the
skean
in
the
clasp
of
the
cloak
walking
on
the
balls
of
my
feet
like
a
not
looking
or
sounding
or
smelling
like
an
earthman
that
rabbit
in
the
traffic
office
had
stirred
up
things
i
be
wiser
to
forget
it
had
been
six
years
six
years
of
slow
death
behind
a
desk
since
the
day
when
rakhal
sensar
had
left
me
a
marked
man
written
on
my
scarred
face
anywhere
outside
the
narrow
confines
of
the
terran
law
on
wolf
rakhal
sensar
my
fists
clenched
with
the
old
impotent
hate
i
could
get
my
hands
on
him
it
had
been
rakhal
who
first
led
me
through
the
byways
of
the
kharsa
teaching
me
the
jargon
of
a
dozen
tribes
the
chirping
call
of
the
the
way
of
the
catmen
of
the
the
argot
of
thieves
markets
the
walk
and
step
of
the
from
shainsa
and
daillon
and
ardcarran
the
parched
cities
of
dusty
salt
stone
which
spread
out
in
the
bottoms
of
wolf
vanished
oceans
rakhal
was
from
shainsa
human
tall
as
an
earthman
weathered
by
salt
and
sun
and
he
had
worked
for
terran
intelligence
since
we
were
boys
we
had
traveled
all
over
our
world
together
and
found
it
good
and
then
for
some
reason
i
had
never
known
it
had
come
to
an
end
even
now
i
was
not
wholly
sure
why
he
had
erupted
that
day
into
violence
and
a
final
explosion
then
he
had
disappeared
leaving
me
a
marked
man
and
a
lonely
one
juli
had
gone
with
him
i
strode
the
streets
of
the
slum
unseeing
my
thoughts
running
a
familiar
channel
juli
my
kid
sister
clinging
around
rakhal
neck
her
gray
eyes
hating
me
i
had
never
seen
her
again
that
had
been
six
years
ago
one
more
adventure
had
shown
me
that
my
usefulness
to
the
secret
service
was
over
rakhal
had
vanished
but
he
had
left
me
a
legacy
my
name
written
on
the
sure
scrolls
of
death
anywhere
outside
the
safe
boundaries
of
terran
law
a
marked
man
i
had
gone
back
to
slow
stagnation
behind
a
desk
i
stood
it
as
long
as
i
could
when
it
finally
got
too
bad
magnusson
had
been
sympathetic
he
was
the
chief
of
terran
intelligence
on
wolf
and
i
was
next
in
line
for
his
job
but
he
understood
when
i
quit
he
arranged
the
transfer
and
the
pass
and
i
was
leaving
tonight
i
was
nearly
back
to
the
spaceport
by
now
across
from
the
at
the
edge
of
the
square
it
was
here
that
the
little
had
vanished
but
it
was
exactly
like
a
thousand
a
hundred
thousand
other
such
on
wolf
a
smudge
of
incense
reeking
and
stinking
before
the
squatting
image
of
nebran
the
toad
god
whose
face
and
symbol
are
everywhere
on
wolf
i
stared
for
a
moment
at
the
ugly
idol
then
slowly
moved
away
the
lighted
curtains
of
the
spaceport
cafe
attracted
my
attention
and
i
went
inside
a
few
spaceport
personnel
in
storm
gear
were
drinking
coffee
at
the
counter
a
pair
of
furred
lounging
beneath
the
mirrors
at
the
far
end
and
a
trio
of
rangy
weathered
men
in
crimson
and
blue
shirt
cloaks
were
standing
at
a
wall
shelf
eating
terran
food
with
aloof
dignity
in
my
business
clothes
i
felt
more
conspicuous
than
the
what
place
had
a
civilian
here
between
the
uniforms
of
the
spacemen
and
the
colorful
brilliance
of
the
a
girl
with
alabaster
hair
came
to
take
my
order
i
asked
for
and
bunlets
and
carried
the
food
to
a
wall
shelf
near
the
their
dialect
fell
soft
and
familiar
on
my
ears
one
of
them
without
altering
the
expression
on
his
face
or
the
easy
tone
of
his
voice
began
to
make
elaborate
comments
on
my
entrance
my
appearance
my
ancestry
and
probably
personal
habits
all
defined
in
the
colorfully
obscene
dialect
of
shainsa
that
had
happened
before
the
wolfan
sense
of
humor
is
only
the
finest
joke
is
to
criticize
and
insult
a
stranger
preferably
an
earthman
to
his
very
face
in
an
unknown
language
perfectly
deadpan
in
my
civilian
clothes
i
was
obviously
fair
game
a
look
or
gesture
of
resentment
would
have
lost
face
and
dignity
what
the
call
their
permanently
i
leaned
over
and
remarked
in
their
own
dialect
that
i
would
at
some
future
and
unspecified
time
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
return
their
compliments
by
rights
they
should
have
laughed
made
some
barbed
remark
about
my
command
of
language
and
crossed
their
hands
in
symbol
of
a
jest
decently
reversed
on
themselves
then
we
would
have
bought
each
other
a
drink
and
that
would
be
that
but
it
did
happen
that
way
not
this
time
the
tallest
of
the
three
whirled
upsetting
his
drink
in
the
process
i
heard
its
thin
shatter
through
the
squeal
of
the
girl
as
a
chair
crashed
over
they
faced
me
three
abreast
and
one
of
them
fumbled
in
the
clasp
of
his
shirtcloak
i
edged
backward
my
own
hand
racing
up
for
a
skean
i
had
carried
in
six
years
and
fronted
them
squarely
hoping
i
could
face
down
the
prospect
of
a
roughhouse
they
would
kill
me
this
close
to
the
hq
but
at
least
i
was
in
for
an
unpleasant
mauling
i
could
handle
three
men
and
if
nerves
were
this
taut
in
the
kharsa
i
might
get
knifed
quite
by
accident
of
course
the
moaned
and
gibbered
the
glared
at
me
and
i
tensed
for
the
moment
when
their
steady
stare
would
explode
into
violence
then
i
became
aware
that
they
were
gazing
not
at
me
but
at
something
or
someone
behind
me
the
skeans
snicked
back
into
the
clasps
of
their
cloaks
then
they
broke
rank
turned
and
ran
they
blundering
into
stools
leaving
havoc
of
upset
benches
and
broken
crockery
in
their
wake
one
man
barged
into
the
counter
swore
and
ran
on
limping
i
let
my
breath
go
something
had
put
the
fear
of
god
into
those
brutes
and
it
was
my
own
ugly
mug
i
turned
and
saw
the
girl
she
was
slight
with
waving
hair
like
spun
black
glass
circled
with
faint
tracery
of
stars
a
black
glass
belt
bound
her
narrow
waist
like
clasped
hands
and
her
robe
stark
white
bore
an
ugly
embroidery
across
the
breasts
the
flat
sprawl
of
a
conventionalized
toad
god
nebran
her
features
were
delicate
chiseled
pale
a
face
all
human
all
woman
but
set
in
an
alien
and
unearthly
repose
the
great
eyes
gleamed
red
they
were
fixed
almost
unseeing
but
the
crimson
lips
were
curved
with
inhuman
malice
she
stood
motionless
looking
at
me
as
if
wondering
why
i
had
not
run
with
the
others
in
half
a
second
the
smile
flickered
off
and
was
replaced
by
a
startled
look
of
recognition
whoever
and
whatever
she
was
she
had
saved
me
a
mauling
i
started
to
phrase
formal
thanks
then
broke
off
in
astonishment
the
cafe
had
emptied
and
we
were
entirely
alone
even
the
had
leaped
through
an
open
window
i
saw
the
whisk
of
a
disappearing
tail
we
stood
frozen
looking
at
one
another
while
the
toad
god
sprawled
across
her
breasts
rose
and
fell
for
half
a
dozen
breaths
then
i
took
one
step
forward
and
she
took
one
step
backward
at
the
same
instant
in
one
swift
movement
she
was
outside
in
the
dark
street
it
took
me
only
an
instant
to
get
into
the
street
after
her
but
as
i
stepped
across
the
door
there
was
a
little
stirring
in
the
air
like
the
rising
of
heat
waves
across
the
salt
flats
at
noon
then
the
was
empty
and
nowhere
was
there
any
sign
of
the
girl
she
had
vanished
she
simply
was
not
there
i
gaped
at
the
empty
shrine
she
had
stepped
inside
and
vanished
like
a
wraith
of
smoke
like
like
the
little
they
had
hunted
out
of
the
kharsa
there
were
eyes
in
the
street
again
and
becoming
aware
of
where
i
was
i
moved
away
the
shrines
of
nebran
are
on
every
corner
of
wolf
but
this
is
one
instance
when
familiarity
does
not
breed
contempt
the
street
was
dark
and
seemed
empty
but
it
was
packed
with
all
the
little
noises
of
living
i
was
not
unobserved
and
meddling
with
a
would
be
just
as
dangerous
as
the
skeans
of
my
three
roughnecks
i
turned
and
crossed
the
square
for
the
last
time
turning
toward
the
loom
of
the
spaceship
filing
the
girl
away
as
just
another
riddle
of
wolf
i
never
solve
how
wrong
i
was
chapter
three
from
the
spaceport
gates
exchanging
brief
greetings
with
the
guards
i
took
a
last
look
at
the
kharsa
for
a
minute
i
toyed
with
the
notion
of
just
disappearing
down
one
of
those
streets
it
not
hard
to
disappear
on
wolf
if
you
know
how
and
i
knew
or
had
known
once
loyalty
to
terra
what
had
terra
given
me
except
a
taste
of
color
and
adventure
out
there
in
the
and
then
taken
it
away
again
if
an
earthman
is
very
lucky
and
very
careful
he
lasts
about
ten
years
in
intelligence
i
had
had
two
years
more
than
my
share
i
still
knew
enough
to
leave
my
terran
identity
behind
like
a
jacket
i
could
seek
out
rakhal
settle
our
see
juli
again
how
could
i
see
juli
again
as
her
husband
murderer
no
other
way
on
wolf
is
a
terrible
and
elaborate
ritual
of
the
code
duello
and
once
i
stepped
outside
the
borders
of
terran
law
sooner
or
later
rakhal
and
i
would
meet
and
one
of
us
would
die
i
looked
back
just
once
at
the
dark
rambling
streets
away
from
the
square
then
i
turned
toward
the
lights
that
hurt
my
eyes
and
the
starship
that
loomed
huge
and
hateful
before
me
a
steward
in
white
took
my
fingerprint
and
led
me
to
a
chamber
he
brought
me
coffee
and
sandwiches
i
had
after
all
eaten
in
the
spaceport
cafe
then
got
me
into
the
skyhook
and
strapped
me
deftly
and
firmly
into
the
acceleration
cushions
tugging
at
the
garensen
belts
until
i
ached
all
over
a
long
needle
went
into
my
arm
the
narcotic
that
would
keep
me
safely
drowsy
all
through
the
terrible
tug
of
interstellar
acceleration
doors
clanged
buzzers
vibrated
lower
down
in
the
ship
men
tramped
the
corridors
calling
to
one
another
in
the
language
of
the
spaceports
i
understood
one
word
in
four
i
shut
my
eyes
not
caring
at
the
end
of
the
trip
there
would
be
another
star
another
world
another
language
another
life
i
had
spent
all
my
adult
life
on
wolf
juli
had
been
a
child
under
the
red
star
but
it
was
a
pair
of
wide
crimson
eyes
and
black
hair
combed
into
ringlets
like
spun
black
glass
that
went
down
with
me
into
the
bottomless
pit
of
sleep
someone
was
shaking
me
ah
come
on
cargill
wake
up
man
shake
your
boots
my
mouth
and
stiff
fumbled
at
the
shapes
of
words
happened
wha
y
want
my
eyes
throbbed
when
i
got
them
open
i
saw
two
men
in
black
leathers
bending
over
me
we
were
still
inside
gravity
get
out
of
the
skyhook
you
coming
with
us
wha
even
through
the
layers
of
the
sedative
that
got
to
me
only
a
criminal
under
interstellar
law
can
be
removed
from
a
starship
once
he
has
formally
checked
in
on
board
i
was
legally
at
this
moment
on
my
planet
of
destination
i
have
been
charged
did
i
say
you
had
snapped
one
man
shut
up
he
doped
the
other
said
hurriedly
look
he
continued
pronouncing
every
word
loudly
and
distinctly
get
up
now
and
come
with
us
the
will
hold
up
blastoff
if
we
do
get
off
in
three
minutes
and
operations
will
scream
come
on
please
then
i
was
stumbling
along
the
lighted
empty
corridor
swaying
between
the
two
men
foggily
realizing
the
crew
must
think
me
a
fugitive
caught
trying
to
leave
the
planet
the
locks
dilated
a
uniformed
spaceman
watched
us
fussily
regarding
a
chronometer
he
fretted
the
dispatcher
office
we
doing
the
best
we
can
the
spaceforce
man
said
can
you
walk
cargill
i
could
though
my
feet
were
a
little
shaky
on
the
ladders
the
violet
moonlight
had
deepened
to
mauve
and
gusty
winds
spun
tendrils
of
grit
across
my
face
the
spaceforce
men
shepherded
me
one
on
either
side
to
the
gateway
what
the
hell
is
all
this
is
something
wrong
with
my
pass
the
guard
shook
his
head
how
would
i
know
magnusson
put
out
the
order
take
it
up
with
him
believe
me
i
muttered
i
will
they
looked
at
each
other
hell
said
one
he
not
under
arrest
we
do
have
to
haul
him
around
like
a
convict
can
you
walk
all
right
now
cargill
you
know
where
the
secret
service
office
is
do
you
floor
the
chief
wants
you
and
make
it
fast
i
knew
it
made
no
sense
to
ask
questions
they
obviously
knew
no
more
than
i
did
i
asked
anyhow
are
they
holding
the
ship
for
me
i
supposed
to
be
leaving
on
it
not
that
one
the
guard
answered
jerking
his
head
toward
the
spaceport
i
looked
back
just
in
time
to
see
the
ship
leap
upward
briefly
whitened
in
the
field
searchlights
and
vanish
into
the
surging
clouds
above
my
head
was
clearing
fast
and
anger
speeded
up
the
process
the
hq
building
was
empty
in
the
chill
silence
of
just
before
dawn
i
had
to
rout
out
a
dozing
elevator
operator
and
as
the
lift
swooped
upward
my
anger
rose
with
it
i
was
working
for
magnusson
any
more
what
right
had
he
or
anybody
to
grab
me
off
an
outbound
starship
like
a
criminal
by
the
time
i
barged
into
his
office
i
was
spoiling
for
a
fight
the
secret
service
office
was
full
of
morning
and
yellow
lights
left
on
from
the
night
before
magnusson
at
his
desk
looked
as
if
he
slept
in
his
rumpled
uniform
he
was
a
big
bull
of
a
man
and
his
littered
desk
looked
as
always
like
the
track
of
a
typhoon
in
the
salt
flats
the
clutter
was
weighted
down
here
and
there
with
solidopic
cubes
of
the
five
magnusson
youngsters
and
as
usual
magnusson
was
fiddling
with
one
of
the
cubes
he
said
not
looking
up
sorry
to
pull
this
at
the
last
minute
race
there
was
just
time
to
put
out
a
pull
order
and
get
you
off
the
ship
but
no
time
to
explain
i
glared
at
him
seems
i
ca
even
get
off
the
planet
without
trouble
you
raised
hell
all
the
time
i
was
here
but
when
i
try
to
leave
what
is
this
anyhow
i
sick
of
being
shoved
around
magnusson
made
a
conciliating
gesture
wait
until
you
hear
he
began
and
broke
off
looking
at
someone
who
was
sitting
in
the
chair
in
front
of
his
desk
somebody
whose
back
was
turned
to
me
then
the
person
twisted
and
i
stopped
cold
blinking
and
wondering
if
this
were
a
hallucination
and
i
wake
up
in
the
starship
skyhook
far
out
in
space
then
the
woman
cried
race
do
you
know
me
i
took
one
dazed
step
and
another
then
she
flew
across
the
space
between
us
her
thin
arms
tangling
around
my
neck
and
i
caught
her
up
still
disbelieving
oh
race
i
thought
i
die
when
mack
told
me
you
were
leaving
tonight
it
been
the
only
thing
that
kept
me
alive
knowing
knowing
i
see
you
she
sobbed
and
laughed
her
face
buried
in
my
shoulder
i
let
her
cry
for
a
minute
then
held
my
sister
at
arm
length
for
a
moment
i
had
forgotten
the
six
years
that
lay
between
us
now
i
saw
them
all
of
them
printed
plain
on
her
face
juli
had
been
a
pretty
girl
six
years
had
fined
her
face
into
beauty
but
there
was
tension
in
the
set
of
her
shoulders
and
her
gray
eyes
had
looked
on
horrors
she
looked
tiny
and
thin
and
unbearably
frail
under
the
scanty
folds
of
her
fur
robe
a
woman
robe
her
wrists
were
manacled
the
jeweled
tight
bracelets
fastened
together
by
the
links
of
a
long
fine
chain
of
silvered
gilt
that
clashed
a
little
thinly
as
her
hands
fell
to
her
sides
what
wrong
juli
where
rakhal
she
shivered
and
now
i
could
see
that
she
was
in
a
state
of
shock
gone
he
gone
that
all
i
know
and
oh
race
race
he
took
rindy
with
him
from
the
tone
of
her
voice
i
had
thought
she
was
sobbing
now
i
realized
that
her
eyes
were
dry
she
was
long
past
tears
gently
i
unclasped
her
clenched
fingers
and
put
her
back
in
the
chair
she
sat
like
a
doll
her
hands
falling
to
her
sides
with
a
thin
clash
of
chains
when
i
picked
them
up
and
laid
them
in
her
lap
she
let
them
lie
there
motionless
i
stood
over
her
and
demanded
who
rindy
she
did
move
my
daughter
race
our
little
girl
magnusson
broke
in
his
voice
harsh
well
cargill
should
i
have
let
you
leave
do
be
a
damn
fool
i
was
afraid
you
tell
the
poor
kid
she
had
to
live
with
her
own
mistakes
growled
magnusson
you
capable
of
it
for
the
first
time
juli
showed
a
sign
of
animation
i
was
afraid
to
come
to
you
mack
you
never
wanted
me
to
marry
rakhal
either
water
under
the
bridge
magnusson
grunted
and
i
got
lads
of
my
own
miss
cargill
he
stopped
in
distress
vaguely
remembering
that
in
the
an
improper
form
of
address
can
be
a
deadly
insult
but
she
guessed
his
predicament
you
used
to
call
me
juli
mack
it
will
do
now
you
changed
he
said
quietly
juli
then
tell
race
what
you
told
me
all
of
it
she
turned
to
me
i
should
have
come
for
myself
i
knew
that
juli
was
proud
and
she
had
always
had
the
courage
to
live
with
her
own
mistakes
when
i
first
saw
her
i
knew
this
would
be
anything
so
simple
as
the
complaint
of
an
abused
wife
or
even
an
abandoned
or
deserted
mother
i
took
a
chair
watching
her
and
listening
she
began
you
made
a
mistake
when
you
turned
rakhal
out
of
the
service
mack
in
his
way
he
was
the
most
loyal
man
you
had
on
wolf
magnusson
had
evidently
not
expected
her
to
take
this
tack
he
scowled
and
looked
disconcerted
shifting
uneasily
in
his
big
chair
but
when
juli
did
not
continue
obviously
awaiting
his
answer
he
said
juli
he
left
me
no
choice
i
never
knew
how
his
mind
worked
that
final
deal
he
engineered
have
you
any
idea
how
much
that
cost
the
service
and
have
you
taken
a
good
look
at
your
brother
face
juli
girl
juli
raised
her
eyes
slowly
and
i
saw
her
flinch
i
knew
how
she
felt
for
three
years
i
had
kept
my
mirror
covered
growing
an
untidy
straggle
of
beard
because
it
hid
the
scars
and
saved
me
the
ordeal
of
facing
myself
to
shave
juli
whispered
rakhal
is
just
as
bad
worse
that
some
satisfaction
i
said
and
mack
stared
at
us
baffled
even
now
i
do
know
what
it
was
all
about
and
you
never
will
i
said
for
the
hundredth
time
we
been
over
this
before
nobody
could
understand
it
unless
he
lived
in
the
let
not
talk
about
it
you
talk
juli
what
brought
you
here
like
this
what
about
the
kid
there
no
way
i
can
tell
you
the
end
without
telling
you
the
beginning
she
said
reasonably
at
first
rakhal
worked
as
a
trader
in
shainsa
i
was
surprised
the
were
the
core
of
terran
trade
on
wolf
and
it
was
through
their
cooperation
that
terra
existed
here
peaceably
on
a
world
only
half
human
or
less
the
men
of
the
existed
strangely
poised
between
two
worlds
they
had
made
dealings
with
the
first
terran
ships
and
thus
gave
entrance
to
the
wedge
of
the
terran
empire
and
yet
they
stood
proud
and
apart
they
alone
had
never
yielded
to
the
terranizing
which
overtakes
all
empire
planets
sooner
or
later
there
were
no
trade
cities
in
the
an
earthman
who
went
there
unprotected
faced
a
thousand
deaths
each
one
worse
than
the
last
there
were
those
who
said
that
the
men
of
shainsa
and
daillon
and
ardcarran
had
sold
the
rest
of
wolf
to
the
terrans
to
keep
the
terrans
from
their
own
door
even
rakhal
who
had
worked
with
terra
since
boyhood
had
finally
come
to
a
point
of
decision
and
gone
his
own
way
and
it
was
not
terra
way
that
was
what
juli
was
saying
now
he
did
like
what
terra
was
doing
on
wolf
i
not
so
sure
i
like
it
myself
magnusson
interrupted
her
again
do
you
know
what
wolf
was
like
when
we
came
here
have
you
seen
the
slave
colony
the
idiot
village
your
own
brother
went
to
shainsa
and
routed
out
the
lisse
and
rakhal
helped
him
juli
reminded
him
even
after
he
left
you
he
tried
to
keep
out
of
things
he
could
have
told
them
a
good
deal
that
would
hurt
you
after
ten
years
in
intelligence
you
know
i
knew
it
was
although
i
was
going
to
tell
juli
this
one
reason
why
at
the
end
during
that
terrible
explosion
of
violence
which
no
normal
terran
mind
could
comprehend
i
had
done
my
best
to
kill
him
we
had
both
known
that
after
this
the
planet
would
not
hold
the
two
of
us
we
could
both
go
on
living
only
by
dividing
it
unevenly
i
had
been
given
the
slow
death
of
the
terran
zone
and
he
had
all
the
rest
but
he
never
told
them
anything
i
tell
you
he
was
one
of
the
most
loyal
mack
grunted
yeah
he
an
angel
go
ahead
she
did
not
immediately
instead
she
asked
what
sounded
like
an
irrelevant
question
is
it
true
what
he
told
me
that
the
empire
has
a
standing
offer
of
a
reward
for
a
working
model
of
a
matter
transmitter
that
offer
been
standing
for
three
hundred
years
terran
reckoning
one
million
credits
cash
do
tell
me
he
was
figuring
to
invent
one
i
do
think
so
but
i
think
he
heard
rumors
about
one
he
said
with
that
kind
of
money
he
could
bargain
the
terrans
right
out
of
shainsa
that
was
where
it
started
he
began
coming
and
going
at
odd
times
but
he
never
said
any
more
about
it
he
would
talk
to
me
at
all
when
was
all
this
about
four
months
ago
in
other
words
just
about
the
time
of
the
riots
in
charin
she
nodded
yes
he
was
away
in
charin
when
the
ghost
wind
blew
and
he
came
back
with
knife
cuts
in
his
thigh
i
asked
if
he
had
been
in
the
rioting
but
he
would
tell
me
race
i
do
know
anything
about
politics
i
do
really
care
but
just
about
that
time
the
great
house
in
shainsa
changed
hands
i
sure
rakhal
had
something
to
do
with
that
and
then
juli
twisted
her
chained
hands
together
in
her
lap
he
tried
to
mix
rindy
up
in
it
it
was
crazy
awful
he
brought
her
some
sort
of
nonhuman
toy
from
one
of
the
lowland
towns
charin
i
think
it
was
a
weird
thing
scared
me
but
he
sit
rindy
down
in
the
sunlight
and
have
her
look
into
it
and
rindy
would
gabble
all
sorts
of
nonsense
about
little
men
and
birds
and
a
toymaker
the
chains
about
juli
wrists
clashed
as
she
twisted
her
hands
together
i
stared
somberly
at
the
fetters
the
chain
which
was
long
did
not
really
hamper
her
movements
much
such
chains
were
symbolic
ornaments
and
most
women
went
all
their
lives
with
fettered
hands
but
even
after
the
years
i
spent
in
the
the
sight
still
brought
an
uneasiness
to
my
throat
a
vague
discomfort
we
had
a
terrible
fight
over
that
juli
went
on
i
was
afraid
afraid
of
what
it
was
doing
to
rindy
i
threw
it
out
and
rindy
woke
up
and
screamed
juli
checked
herself
and
caught
at
vanishing
but
you
do
want
to
hear
about
that
it
was
then
i
threatened
to
leave
him
and
take
rindy
the
next
day
suddenly
the
hysteria
juli
had
been
forcing
back
broke
free
and
she
rocked
back
and
forth
in
her
chair
shaken
and
strangled
with
sobs
he
took
rindy
oh
race
crazy
crazy
i
think
he
hates
rindy
he
he
race
smashed
her
he
took
every
toy
the
child
had
and
broke
them
one
by
one
smashed
them
into
powder
every
toy
the
child
had
juli
please
please
magnusson
pleaded
shaken
if
we
dealing
with
a
maniac
i
do
dare
think
he
harm
her
he
warned
me
not
to
come
here
or
never
see
her
again
but
if
it
meant
war
against
terra
i
had
to
come
but
mack
please
do
do
anything
against
him
please
please
got
my
baby
he
got
my
little
girl
her
voice
failed
and
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
mack
picked
up
the
solidopic
cube
of
his
son
and
turned
it
between
his
pudgy
fingers
saying
unhappily
juli
we
take
every
precaution
but
ca
you
see
we
got
to
get
him
if
there
a
question
of
a
matter
transmitter
or
anything
like
that
in
the
hands
of
terra
enemies
i
could
see
that
too
but
juli
agonized
face
came
between
me
and
the
picture
of
disaster
i
clenched
my
fist
around
the
chair
arm
not
surprised
to
see
the
fragile
plastic
buckle
crack
and
split
under
my
grip
it
had
been
rakhal
neck
mack
let
me
handle
this
juli
shall
i
find
rindy
for
you
a
hope
was
born
in
her
ravaged
face
and
died
while
i
looked
race
he
kill
you
or
have
you
killed
he
try
i
admitted
the
moment
rakhal
knew
i
was
outside
the
terran
zone
i
walk
with
death
i
had
accepted
the
code
during
my
years
in
shainsa
but
now
i
was
an
earthman
and
felt
only
contempt
ca
you
see
once
he
knows
i
at
large
that
very
code
of
his
will
force
him
to
abandon
any
intrigue
whatever
you
call
it
conspiracy
and
come
after
me
first
that
way
we
do
two
things
we
get
him
out
of
hiding
and
we
get
him
out
of
the
conspiracy
if
there
is
one
i
looked
at
the
shaking
juli
and
something
snapped
i
stooped
and
lifted
her
not
gently
my
hands
biting
her
shoulders
and
i
wo
kill
him
do
you
hear
he
may
wish
i
had
by
the
time
i
get
through
with
him
beat
the
living
hell
out
of
him
i
cram
my
fists
down
his
throat
but
i
settle
it
with
him
like
an
earthman
i
wo
kill
him
me
juli
because
that
the
worst
thing
i
could
do
to
him
catch
him
and
let
him
live
afterward
magnusson
stepped
toward
me
and
pried
my
crushing
hands
off
her
arms
juli
rubbed
the
bruises
mechanically
not
knowing
she
was
doing
it
mack
said
you
ca
do
it
cargill
you
would
get
as
far
as
daillon
you
have
been
out
of
the
zone
in
six
years
besides
his
eyes
rested
full
on
my
face
i
hate
to
say
this
race
but
damn
it
man
go
and
take
a
good
look
at
yourself
in
a
mirror
do
you
think
ever
have
pulled
you
off
the
secret
service
otherwise
how
in
hell
can
you
disguise
yourself
now
there
are
plenty
of
scarred
men
in
the
i
said
rakhal
will
remember
my
scars
but
i
do
think
anyone
else
would
look
twice
magnusson
walked
to
the
window
his
huge
form
bulked
against
the
light
perceptibly
darkening
the
office
he
looked
over
the
faraway
panorama
the
neat
bright
trade
city
below
and
the
vast
wilderness
lying
outside
i
could
almost
hear
the
wheels
grinding
in
his
head
finally
he
swung
around
race
i
heard
these
rumors
before
but
you
the
only
man
i
could
have
sent
to
track
them
down
and
i
would
send
you
out
in
cold
blood
to
be
killed
i
wo
now
spaceforce
will
pick
him
up
i
heard
the
harsh
inward
gasp
of
juli
breath
and
said
damn
it
no
the
first
move
you
make
i
could
finish
rindy
was
in
his
hands
and
when
i
knew
rakhal
he
had
been
given
to
making
idle
threats
we
all
three
knew
what
rakhal
might
do
at
the
first
hint
of
the
long
arm
of
terran
law
reaching
out
for
him
i
said
for
god
sake
let
keep
spaceforce
out
of
it
let
it
look
like
a
personal
matter
between
rakhal
and
me
and
let
us
settle
it
on
those
terms
remember
he
got
the
kid
magnusson
sighed
again
he
picked
up
one
of
the
cubes
and
stared
into
the
clear
plastic
where
the
image
of
a
girl
looked
out
at
him
smiling
and
innocent
his
face
was
transparent
as
the
plastic
cube
mack
acts
tough
but
he
has
five
kids
and
he
is
as
soft
as
a
dish
of
pudding
where
a
kid
is
concerned
i
know
another
thing
too
if
we
send
out
spaceforce
after
all
the
riots
how
many
terrans
are
on
this
planet
a
few
thousand
no
more
what
chance
would
we
have
if
it
turned
into
a
rebellion
none
at
all
unless
we
wanted
to
order
a
massacre
sure
we
have
bombs
and
and
all
that
but
would
we
dare
to
use
them
and
where
would
we
be
after
that
here
to
keep
the
pot
from
boiling
over
to
keep
out
of
planetary
incidents
not
push
them
along
to
a
point
where
bluff
wo
work
why
we
got
to
pick
up
rakhal
before
this
gets
out
of
hand
i
said
give
me
a
month
then
you
can
move
in
if
you
have
to
rakhal
ca
do
much
against
terra
in
that
time
and
i
might
be
able
to
keep
rindy
out
of
it
magnusson
stared
at
me
if
you
do
this
against
my
advice
i
wo
be
able
to
step
in
and
pull
you
out
of
a
jam
later
on
you
know
and
god
help
you
if
you
start
up
the
machines
and
ca
stop
them
i
knew
that
a
month
was
much
wolf
is
forty
thousand
miles
of
diameter
at
least
half
unexplored
mountain
and
forest
swarming
with
nonhuman
and
cities
where
terrans
had
never
been
finding
rakhal
or
any
one
man
would
be
like
picking
out
one
star
in
the
andromeda
nebula
not
impossible
not
impossible
mack
eyes
wandered
again
to
his
child
face
deep
in
the
transparent
cube
he
turned
it
in
his
hands
okay
cargill
he
said
slowly
so
we
all
crazy
i
be
crazy
too
try
it
your
way
chapter
four
by
sunset
i
was
ready
to
leave
i
had
had
any
loose
ends
to
tie
up
in
the
trade
city
since
i
already
disposed
of
most
of
my
gear
before
boarding
the
starship
i
never
been
in
better
circumstances
to
take
off
for
parts
unknown
mack
still
disapproving
had
opened
the
files
to
me
and
i
spent
most
of
the
day
in
the
back
rooms
of
floor
searching
intelligence
files
to
refresh
my
memory
scanning
the
pages
of
my
own
old
reports
sent
years
ago
from
shainsa
and
daillon
he
had
sent
out
one
of
the
nonhumans
who
worked
for
us
to
buy
or
acquire
somewhere
in
the
old
town
a
outfit
and
the
other
things
i
would
wear
and
carry
i
would
have
liked
to
go
myself
i
felt
that
i
needed
the
practice
i
was
only
now
beginning
to
realize
how
much
i
might
have
forgotten
in
the
years
behind
a
desk
but
until
i
was
ready
to
make
my
presence
known
no
one
must
know
that
race
cargill
had
not
left
wolf
on
the
starship
above
all
i
must
not
be
seen
in
the
kharsa
until
i
went
there
in
the
disguise
which
had
become
years
ago
a
deep
second
nature
almost
an
alternate
personality
about
sunset
i
walked
through
the
clean
little
streets
of
the
terran
trade
city
toward
the
magnusson
home
where
juli
was
waiting
for
me
most
of
the
men
who
go
into
civil
service
of
the
empire
come
from
earth
or
from
the
planets
of
proxima
and
alpha
centaurus
they
go
out
unmarried
and
they
stay
that
way
or
marry
women
native
to
the
planets
where
they
are
sent
but
joanna
magnusson
was
one
of
the
rare
earth
women
who
had
come
out
with
her
husband
twenty
years
ago
there
are
two
kinds
of
earthwomen
like
that
they
make
their
quarterings
a
little
bit
of
home
or
a
little
bit
of
hell
joanna
had
made
their
house
look
like
a
transported
corner
of
earth
i
never
knew
quite
what
to
think
of
the
magnusson
household
it
seemed
to
me
almost
madness
to
live
under
a
red
sun
yet
come
inside
to
yellow
light
to
live
on
a
world
with
the
wild
beauty
of
wolf
and
yet
live
as
they
might
have
lived
on
their
home
planet
or
maybe
i
was
the
one
who
was
out
of
step
i
had
done
the
reprehensible
thing
they
called
going
native
possibly
i
had
done
just
that
and
in
absorbing
myself
into
the
new
world
had
lost
the
ability
to
fit
into
the
old
joanna
a
chubby
comfortable
woman
in
her
forties
opened
the
door
and
gave
me
her
hand
come
in
race
juli
expecting
you
it
good
of
you
i
broke
off
unable
to
express
my
gratitude
juli
and
i
had
come
from
earth
our
father
had
been
an
officer
on
the
old
starship
when
juli
was
only
a
child
he
had
died
in
a
wreck
off
procyon
and
mack
magnusson
had
found
me
a
place
in
intelligence
because
i
spoke
four
of
the
wolf
languages
and
haunted
the
kharsa
with
rakhal
whenever
i
could
get
away
they
had
also
taken
juli
into
their
own
home
like
a
younger
sister
they
had
said
much
because
they
had
liked
rakhal
when
the
breakup
came
but
that
terrible
night
when
rakhal
and
i
nearly
killed
each
other
and
rakhal
came
with
his
face
bleeding
and
took
juli
away
with
him
had
hurt
them
hard
yet
it
had
made
them
all
the
kinder
to
me
joanna
said
forthrightly
nonsense
race
what
else
could
we
do
she
drew
me
along
the
hall
you
can
talk
in
here
i
delayed
a
minute
before
going
through
the
door
she
indicated
how
is
juli
better
i
think
i
put
her
to
bed
in
meta
room
and
she
slept
most
of
the
day
she
be
all
right
i
leave
you
to
talk
joanna
opened
the
door
and
went
away
juli
was
awake
and
dressed
and
already
some
of
the
terrible
frozen
horror
was
gone
from
her
face
she
was
still
tense
and
but
not
hysterical
now
the
room
one
of
the
children
bedrooms
was
a
big
one
even
at
the
top
of
the
secret
service
a
cop
does
live
too
well
not
on
civil
service
pay
scale
not
with
five
youngsters
it
looked
as
if
all
five
of
the
kids
had
taken
it
to
pieces
one
at
a
time
i
sat
down
on
a
chair
and
said
juli
we
have
much
time
i
got
to
be
out
of
the
city
before
dark
i
want
to
know
about
rakhal
what
he
does
what
he
like
now
remember
i
have
seen
him
for
years
tell
me
everything
his
friends
his
amusements
everything
you
know
i
always
thought
you
knew
him
better
than
i
did
juli
had
a
fidgety
little
way
of
coiling
the
links
of
the
chain
around
her
wrists
and
it
made
me
nervous
it
routine
juli
police
work
mostly
i
play
by
ear
but
i
try
to
start
out
by
being
methodical
she
answered
everything
i
asked
her
but
the
sum
total
was
much
and
it
would
help
much
as
i
said
it
easy
to
disappear
on
wolf
juli
knew
he
had
been
friendly
with
the
new
holders
of
the
great
house
on
shainsa
but
she
did
even
know
their
name
i
heard
one
of
the
magnusson
children
fly
to
the
street
door
and
return
shouting
for
her
mother
joanna
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
room
and
came
in
there
a
outside
who
wants
to
see
you
race
i
nodded
probably
my
fancy
dress
can
i
change
in
the
back
room
joanna
will
you
keep
my
clothes
here
till
i
get
back
i
went
to
the
door
and
spoke
to
the
furred
nonhuman
in
the
sibilant
jargon
of
the
kharsa
and
he
handed
me
what
looked
like
a
bundle
of
rags
there
were
hard
lumps
inside
the
said
softly
i
hear
a
rumor
in
the
kharsa
perhaps
it
will
help
you
three
men
from
shainsa
are
in
the
city
they
came
here
to
seek
a
woman
who
has
vanished
and
a
toymaker
they
are
returning
at
sunrise
perhaps
you
can
arrange
to
travel
in
their
caravan
i
thanked
him
and
carried
the
bundle
inside
in
the
empty
back
room
i
stripped
to
the
skin
and
unrolled
the
bundle
there
was
a
pair
of
baggy
striped
breeches
a
worn
and
shabby
shirtcloak
with
capacious
pockets
a
looped
belt
with
half
the
gilt
rubbed
away
and
the
base
metal
showing
through
and
a
scuffed
pair
of
tied
with
frayed
thongs
of
different
colors
there
was
a
little
cluster
of
amulets
and
seals
i
chose
two
or
three
of
the
commonest
kind
and
strung
them
around
my
neck
one
of
the
lumps
in
the
bundle
was
a
small
jar
holding
nothing
but
the
ordinary
spices
sold
in
the
market
with
which
the
average
flavors
food
i
rubbed
some
of
the
powder
on
my
body
put
a
pinch
in
the
pocket
of
my
shirtcloak
and
chewed
a
few
of
the
buds
wrinkling
my
nose
at
the
pungency
the
second
lump
was
a
skean
and
unlike
the
worn
and
shabby
garments
this
was
and
sharp
and
bright
and
its
edge
held
a
razor
glint
i
tucked
it
into
the
clasp
of
my
shirtcloak
a
reassuring
weight
it
was
the
only
weapon
i
could
dare
to
carry
the
last
of
the
solid
objects
in
the
bundle
was
a
flat
wooden
case
about
nine
by
ten
inches
i
slid
it
open
it
was
divided
carefully
into
sections
cushioned
with
plastic
and
in
them
lay
tiny
slips
of
glass
on
wolf
as
precious
as
jewels
they
were
lenses
camera
lenses
microscope
lenses
even
eyeglass
lenses
packed
close
there
were
nearly
a
hundred
of
them
nested
by
the
stuff
they
were
my
excuse
for
travel
to
shainsa
over
and
above
the
necessities
of
trade
a
few
items
of
terran
manufacture
vacuum
tubes
transistors
lenses
for
cameras
and
binoculars
liquors
and
finely
forged
small
tools
are
literally
worth
their
weight
in
platinum
even
in
cities
where
terrans
have
never
gone
these
things
bring
exorbitant
prices
and
trading
in
them
is
a
privilege
rakhal
had
been
a
trader
so
juli
told
me
in
fine
wire
and
surgical
instruments
wolf
is
not
a
mechanized
planet
and
has
never
developed
any
indigenous
industrial
system
the
psychology
of
the
nonhuman
seldom
runs
to
technological
advances
i
went
down
the
hallway
again
to
the
room
where
juli
was
waiting
catching
a
glimpse
in
a
mirror
i
was
startled
all
traces
of
the
terran
civil
servant
clumsy
and
uncomfortable
in
his
clothes
had
dropped
away
a
rangy
and
scarred
looked
out
at
me
and
it
seemed
that
the
expression
on
his
face
was
one
of
amazement
joanna
whirled
as
i
came
into
the
room
and
visibly
paled
before
recovering
her
she
gave
a
nervous
little
giggle
goodness
race
i
did
know
you
juli
whispered
yes
i
i
remember
you
better
like
that
you
you
look
so
much
like
the
door
flew
open
and
mickey
magnusson
scampered
into
the
room
a
chubby
little
boy
browned
by
a
sunlamp
and
glowing
with
health
in
his
hand
he
held
some
sparkling
thing
that
gave
off
tiny
flashes
and
glints
of
color
i
gave
the
kid
a
grin
before
i
realized
that
i
was
disguised
anyhow
and
probably
a
hideous
sight
the
little
boy
backed
off
but
joanna
put
her
plump
hand
on
his
shoulder
murmuring
soothing
things
mickey
toddled
toward
juli
holding
up
the
shining
thing
in
his
hands
as
if
to
display
something
very
precious
and
beloved
juli
bent
and
held
out
her
arms
then
her
face
contracted
and
she
snatched
at
the
plaything
mickey
what
that
he
thrust
it
protectively
behind
his
back
mine
mickey
do
be
naughty
joanna
chided
please
let
me
see
juli
coaxed
and
he
brought
it
out
slowly
still
suspicious
it
was
an
angled
prism
of
crystal
set
in
a
frame
which
could
get
the
star
spinning
like
a
solidopic
but
it
displayed
a
new
and
comical
face
every
time
it
was
turned
mickey
turned
it
round
and
round
charmed
at
being
the
center
of
attention
there
seemed
to
be
dozens
of
faces
shifting
with
each
spin
of
the
prism
human
and
nonhuman
all
dim
and
slightly
distorted
my
own
face
juli
joanna
came
out
of
the
crystal
surface
not
a
reflection
but
a
caricature
a
choked
sound
from
juli
made
me
turn
in
dismay
she
had
let
herself
drop
to
the
floor
and
was
sitting
there
white
as
death
supporting
herself
with
her
two
hands
race
find
out
where
he
got
that
that
i
bent
and
shook
her
what
the
matter
with
you
i
demanded
she
had
lapsed
into
the
dazed
sleepwalking
horror
of
this
morning
she
whispered
it
not
a
toy
rindy
had
one
joanna
did
he
get
she
pointed
at
the
shining
thing
with
an
expression
of
horror
which
would
have
been
laughable
had
it
been
less
real
less
filled
with
terror
joanna
cocked
her
head
to
one
side
and
wrinkled
her
forehead
reflectively
why
i
do
know
now
you
come
to
ask
me
i
thought
maybe
one
of
the
had
given
it
to
mickey
bought
it
in
the
bazaar
maybe
he
loves
it
do
get
up
off
the
floor
juli
juli
scrambled
to
her
feet
she
said
rindy
had
one
it
it
terrified
me
she
would
sit
and
look
at
it
by
the
hour
and
i
told
you
about
it
race
i
threw
it
out
once
and
she
woke
up
and
screamed
she
shrieked
for
hours
and
hours
and
she
ran
out
in
the
dark
and
dug
for
it
in
the
trash
pile
where
i
buried
it
she
went
out
in
the
dark
broke
all
her
fingernails
but
she
dug
it
out
again
she
checked
herself
staring
at
joanna
her
eyes
wide
in
appeal
well
dear
said
joanna
with
mild
rebuking
kindness
you
need
be
so
upset
i
do
think
mickey
so
attached
to
it
as
all
that
and
anyhow
i
not
going
to
throw
it
away
she
patted
juli
reassuringly
on
the
shoulder
then
gave
mickey
a
little
shove
toward
the
door
and
turned
to
follow
him
you
want
to
talk
alone
before
race
leaves
good
luck
wherever
you
going
race
she
held
out
her
hand
forthrightly
and
do
worry
about
juli
she
added
in
an
undertone
we
take
good
care
of
her
when
i
came
back
to
juli
she
was
standing
by
the
window
looking
through
the
oddly
filtered
glass
that
dimmed
the
red
sun
to
orange
joanna
thinks
i
crazy
race
she
thinks
you
upset
rindy
an
odd
child
a
real
but
it
not
my
imagination
race
it
not
there
something
suddenly
she
sobbed
aloud
again
homesick
juli
i
was
a
little
the
first
years
but
i
was
happy
believe
me
she
turned
her
face
to
me
shining
with
tears
you
got
to
believe
i
never
regretted
it
for
a
minute
i
glad
i
said
dully
made
it
just
only
that
toy
who
knows
it
might
be
a
clue
to
something
the
toy
had
reminded
me
of
something
too
and
i
tried
to
remember
what
it
was
i
seen
nonhuman
toys
in
the
kharsa
even
bought
them
for
mack
kids
when
a
single
man
is
invited
frequently
to
a
home
with
five
youngsters
it
about
the
only
way
he
can
repay
that
hospitality
by
bringing
the
children
odd
trifles
and
knicknacks
but
i
had
never
seen
anything
quite
like
this
one
until
until
yesterday
the
they
had
hunted
out
of
the
kharsa
the
one
who
had
fled
into
the
shrine
of
nebran
and
vanished
he
had
had
half
a
dozen
of
those
sparklers
i
tried
to
call
up
a
mental
picture
of
the
little
i
have
much
luck
i
seen
him
only
in
that
one
swift
glance
from
beneath
his
hood
juli
have
you
ever
seen
a
little
man
like
a
only
smaller
twisted
hunchbacked
he
sells
toys
she
looked
blank
i
do
think
so
although
there
are
dwarf
in
the
polar
cities
but
i
sure
i
never
seen
one
it
was
just
an
idea
but
it
was
something
to
think
about
a
had
vanished
rakhal
before
disappearing
had
smashed
all
rindy
toys
and
the
sight
of
a
plaything
of
crystal
had
sent
juli
into
hysterics
i
better
go
before
it
too
dark
i
said
i
buckled
the
final
clasp
of
my
shirtcloak
fitted
my
skean
another
notch
into
it
and
counted
the
money
mack
had
advanced
me
for
expenses
i
want
to
get
into
the
kharsa
and
hunt
up
the
caravan
to
shainsa
you
going
there
first
where
else
juli
turned
leaning
one
hand
against
the
wall
she
looked
frail
and
ill
years
older
than
she
was
suddenly
she
flung
her
thin
arms
around
me
and
a
link
of
the
chain
on
her
fettered
hands
struck
me
hard
as
she
cried
out
race
race
he
kill
you
how
can
i
live
with
that
on
my
conscience
too
you
can
live
with
a
hell
of
a
lot
on
your
conscience
i
disengaged
her
arms
firmly
from
my
neck
a
link
of
the
chain
caught
on
the
clasp
of
my
shirtcloak
and
again
something
snapped
inside
me
i
grasped
the
chain
in
my
two
hands
and
gave
a
mighty
heave
bracing
my
foot
against
the
wall
the
links
snapped
asunder
a
flying
end
struck
juli
under
the
eye
i
ripped
at
the
seals
of
the
jeweled
cuffs
tore
them
from
her
arms
find
threw
the
whole
assembly
into
a
corner
where
it
fell
with
a
clash
damn
it
i
roared
that
over
you
never
going
to
wear
things
again
maybe
after
six
years
in
the
juli
was
beginning
to
guess
what
those
six
years
behind
a
desk
had
meant
to
me
juli
i
find
your
rindy
for
you
and
i
bring
rakhal
in
alive
but
do
ask
more
than
that
just
and
do
ask
me
how
he
be
alive
when
i
got
through
with
him
sure
he
be
alive
just
chapter
five
it
was
getting
dark
when
i
slipped
through
a
side
gate
shabby
and
inconspicuous
into
the
spaceport
square
beyond
the
yellow
lamps
i
knew
that
the
old
city
was
beginning
to
take
on
life
with
the
falling
night
out
of
the
chinked
men
and
woman
human
and
nonhuman
came
forth
into
the
moonlit
streets
if
anyone
noticed
me
cross
the
square
which
i
doubted
they
took
me
for
just
another
vagabond
curious
about
the
world
of
the
strangers
from
beyond
the
stars
and
who
curiosity
satisfied
was
drifting
back
where
he
belonged
i
turned
down
one
of
the
dark
alleys
that
led
away
and
soon
was
walking
in
the
dark
the
kharsa
was
not
unfamiliar
to
me
as
a
terran
but
for
the
last
six
years
i
had
seen
only
its
daytime
face
i
doubted
if
there
were
a
dozen
earthmen
in
the
old
town
tonight
though
i
saw
one
in
the
bazaar
dirty
and
lurching
drunk
one
of
those
who
run
renegade
and
homeless
between
worlds
belonging
to
neither
this
was
what
i
had
nearly
become
i
went
further
up
the
hill
with
the
rising
streets
once
i
turned
and
saw
below
me
the
spaceport
the
black
loom
of
the
skyscraper
like
a
patch
of
alien
shadow
in
the
moonlight
i
turned
my
back
on
them
and
walked
on
at
the
fringe
of
the
thieves
market
i
paused
outside
a
wineshop
where
were
made
welcome
a
golden
nonhuman
child
murmured
something
as
she
pattered
by
me
in
the
street
and
i
stopped
gripped
by
a
spasm
of
stagefright
had
the
dialect
of
shainsa
grown
rusty
on
my
tongue
spies
were
given
short
shrift
on
wolf
and
a
mile
from
the
spaceport
i
might
as
well
have
been
on
one
of
those
moons
there
were
no
spaceport
shockers
at
my
back
now
and
someone
might
remember
the
tale
of
an
earthman
with
a
scarred
face
who
had
gone
to
shainsa
in
disguise
i
shrugged
the
shirtcloak
around
my
shoulders
pushed
the
door
and
went
in
i
had
remembered
that
rakhal
was
waiting
for
me
not
beyond
this
door
but
at
the
end
of
the
trail
behind
some
other
door
somewhere
and
we
have
a
byword
in
shainsa
trail
without
beginning
has
no
right
there
i
stopped
thinking
about
juli
rindy
the
terran
empire
or
what
rakhal
who
knew
too
many
of
terra
secrets
might
do
if
he
had
turned
renegade
my
fingers
went
up
and
stroked
musingly
the
ridge
of
scar
tissue
along
my
mouth
at
that
moment
i
was
thinking
only
of
rakhal
of
an
unsettled
and
of
my
revenge
red
lamps
were
burning
inside
the
wineshop
where
men
reclined
on
frowsy
couches
i
stumbled
over
one
of
them
found
an
empty
place
and
let
myself
sink
down
on
it
arranging
myself
automatically
in
the
sprawl
of
indoors
in
public
they
stood
rigid
and
formal
even
to
eat
and
drink
among
themselves
anything
less
than
a
sprawl
betrayed
insulting
watchfulness
only
a
man
who
fears
secret
murder
keeps
himself
on
guard
a
girl
with
a
tangled
rope
of
hair
down
her
back
came
toward
me
her
hands
were
unchained
meaning
she
was
a
woman
of
the
lowest
class
not
worth
safeguarding
her
fur
smock
was
shabby
and
matted
with
filth
i
sent
her
for
wine
when
it
came
it
was
surprisingly
good
the
sweet
and
treacherous
wine
of
ardcarran
i
sipped
it
slowly
looking
round
if
a
caravan
for
shainsa
were
leaving
tomorrow
it
would
be
known
here
a
word
dropped
that
i
was
returning
there
would
bring
me
by
ironbound
custom
an
invitation
to
travel
in
their
company
when
i
sent
the
woman
for
wine
a
second
time
a
man
on
a
nearby
couch
got
up
and
walked
over
to
me
he
was
tall
even
for
a
and
there
was
something
vaguely
familiar
about
him
he
was
no
riffraff
of
the
kharsa
either
for
his
shirtcloak
was
of
rich
silk
interwoven
with
metallic
threads
and
crusted
with
heavy
embroideries
the
hilt
of
his
skean
was
carved
from
a
single
green
gem
he
stood
looking
down
at
me
for
some
time
before
he
spoke
i
never
forget
a
voice
although
i
can
not
bring
your
face
to
mind
have
i
a
duty
toward
you
i
had
spoken
a
jargon
to
the
girl
but
he
addressed
me
in
the
lilting
speech
of
shainsa
i
made
no
answer
gesturing
him
to
be
seated
on
wolf
formal
courtesy
requires
a
series
of
polite
and
while
a
direct
question
merely
borders
on
rudeness
a
direct
answer
is
the
mark
of
a
simpleton
a
drink
i
joined
you
unasked
he
retorted
and
summoned
the
girl
bring
us
better
wine
than
this
swill
with
that
word
and
gesture
i
recognized
him
and
my
teeth
clamped
hard
on
my
lip
this
was
the
loudmouth
who
had
shown
fight
in
the
spaceport
cafe
and
run
away
before
the
dark
girl
with
the
sign
of
nebran
sprawled
on
her
breast
but
in
this
poor
light
he
had
not
recognized
me
i
moved
deliberately
into
the
full
red
glow
if
he
did
not
know
me
for
the
terran
he
had
challenged
last
night
in
the
spaceport
cafe
it
was
unlikely
that
anyone
else
would
he
stared
at
me
for
some
minutes
but
in
the
end
he
only
shrugged
and
poured
wine
from
the
bottle
he
had
ordered
three
drinks
later
i
knew
that
his
name
was
kyral
and
that
he
was
a
trader
in
wire
and
fine
steel
tools
through
the
nonhuman
towns
and
i
had
given
him
the
name
i
had
chosen
rascar
he
asked
are
you
thinking
of
returning
to
shainsa
wary
of
a
trap
i
hesitated
but
the
question
seemed
harmless
so
i
only
countered
have
you
been
long
in
the
kharsa
several
weeks
trading
no
he
applied
himself
to
the
wine
again
i
was
searching
for
a
member
of
my
family
did
you
find
him
her
said
kyral
and
ceremoniously
spat
no
i
did
find
her
what
is
your
business
in
shainsa
i
chuckled
briefly
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
am
searching
for
a
member
of
my
family
he
narrowed
his
eyelids
as
if
he
suspected
me
of
mocking
him
but
personal
privacy
is
the
most
rigid
convention
of
the
and
such
mockery
showed
a
sensible
disregard
for
prying
questions
if
i
did
not
choose
to
answer
them
he
questioned
no
further
i
can
use
an
extra
man
to
handle
the
loads
are
you
good
with
pack
animals
if
so
you
are
welcome
to
travel
under
the
protection
of
my
caravan
i
agreed
then
reflecting
that
juli
and
rakhal
must
after
all
be
known
in
shainsa
i
asked
do
you
know
a
trader
who
calls
himself
sensar
he
started
slightly
i
saw
his
eyes
move
along
my
scars
then
reserve
like
a
lowered
curtain
shut
itself
over
his
face
concealing
a
brief
satisfied
glimmer
no
he
lied
and
stood
up
we
leave
at
first
daylight
have
your
gear
ready
he
flipped
something
at
me
and
i
caught
it
in
midair
it
was
a
stone
incised
with
name
in
the
ideographs
of
shainsa
you
can
sleep
with
the
caravan
if
you
care
to
show
that
token
to
cuinn
kyral
caravan
was
encamped
in
a
barred
field
past
the
furthest
gates
of
the
kharsa
about
a
dozen
men
were
busy
loading
the
pack
animals
horses
shipped
in
from
darkover
mostly
i
asked
the
first
man
i
met
for
cuinn
he
pointed
out
a
burly
fellow
in
a
shiny
red
shirtcloak
who
was
busy
at
chewing
out
one
of
the
young
men
for
the
way
he
put
a
packsaddle
on
his
beast
shainsa
is
a
good
language
for
cursing
but
cuinn
had
a
special
talent
at
it
i
blinked
in
admiration
while
i
waited
for
him
to
get
his
breath
so
i
could
hand
him
kyral
token
in
the
light
of
the
fire
i
saw
what
i
half
expected
he
was
the
second
of
the
who
tried
to
rough
me
up
in
the
spaceport
cafe
cuinn
barely
glanced
at
the
cut
stone
and
tossed
it
back
pointing
out
one
of
the
packhorses
load
your
personal
gear
on
that
one
then
get
busy
and
show
this
wearer
of
sandals
an
insult
carrying
particularly
filthy
implications
in
shainsa
how
to
fasten
a
packstrap
he
drew
breath
and
began
to
swear
at
the
luckless
youngster
again
and
i
relaxed
he
evidently
had
recognized
me
either
i
took
the
strap
in
my
hand
guiding
it
through
the
saddle
loop
like
that
i
told
the
kid
and
cuinn
stopped
swearing
long
enough
to
give
me
a
curt
nod
of
acknowledgment
and
point
out
a
heap
of
boxed
and
crated
objects
help
him
load
up
we
want
to
get
clear
of
the
city
by
daybreak
he
ordered
and
went
off
to
swear
at
someone
else
kyral
turned
up
at
dawn
and
a
few
minutes
later
the
camp
had
vanished
into
a
small
scattering
of
litter
and
we
were
on
our
way
kyral
caravan
in
spite
of
cuinn
cursing
was
and
the
men
were
eleven
of
them
silent
and
capable
and
most
of
them
very
young
they
were
cheerful
on
the
trail
handled
the
pack
animals
competently
during
the
day
and
spent
most
of
the
nights
grouped
around
the
fire
gambling
silently
on
the
fall
of
the
prisms
they
used
for
dice
three
days
out
of
the
kharsa
i
began
to
worry
about
cuinn
it
was
of
course
a
spectacular
piece
of
bad
luck
to
find
all
three
of
the
men
from
the
spaceport
cafe
in
kyral
caravan
kyral
had
obviously
not
known
me
and
even
by
daylight
he
paid
no
attention
to
me
except
to
give
an
occasional
order
the
second
of
the
three
was
a
gangling
kid
who
probably
never
gave
me
a
second
look
let
alone
a
third
but
cuinn
was
another
matter
he
was
a
man
my
own
age
and
his
fierce
eyes
had
a
shrewdness
in
them
that
i
did
not
trust
more
than
once
i
caught
him
watching
me
and
on
the
two
or
three
occasions
when
he
drew
me
into
conversation
i
found
his
questions
more
direct
than
good
manners
allowed
i
weighed
the
possibility
that
i
might
have
to
kill
him
before
we
reached
shainsa
we
crossed
the
foothills
and
began
to
climb
upward
toward
the
mountains
the
first
few
days
i
found
myself
short
of
breath
as
we
worked
upward
into
thinner
air
then
my
acclimatization
returned
and
i
began
to
fall
into
the
pattern
of
the
days
and
nights
on
the
trail
the
trade
city
was
still
a
beacon
in
the
night
but
its
glow
on
the
horizon
grew
dimmer
with
each
day
march
higher
we
climbed
along
dangerous
trails
where
men
had
to
dismount
and
let
the
pack
animals
pick
their
way
foot
by
foot
here
in
these
altitudes
the
sun
at
noonday
blazed
redder
and
brighter
and
the
who
come
from
the
parched
lands
in
the
were
burned
and
blistered
by
the
fierce
light
i
had
grown
up
under
the
blazing
sun
of
terra
and
a
red
sun
like
wolf
even
at
its
hottest
caused
me
no
discomfort
this
alone
would
have
made
me
suspect
once
again
i
found
cuinn
fierce
eyes
watching
me
as
we
crossed
the
passes
and
began
to
descend
the
long
trail
through
the
thick
forests
we
got
into
nonhuman
country
racing
against
the
ghost
wind
we
skirted
the
country
around
charin
and
the
woods
inhabited
by
the
terrible
birdlike
creatures
who
turn
cannibal
when
the
ghost
wind
blows
later
the
trail
wound
through
thicker
forests
of
indigo
trees
and
brushwood
and
at
night
we
heard
the
howls
of
the
catmen
of
these
latitudes
at
night
we
set
guards
about
the
caravan
and
the
dark
spaces
and
shadows
were
filled
with
noises
and
queer
smells
and
rustlings
nevertheless
the
day
marches
and
the
night
watches
passed
without
event
until
the
night
i
shared
guard
with
cuinn
i
had
posted
myself
at
the
edge
of
the
camp
the
fire
behind
me
the
men
were
sleeping
rolls
of
snores
huddled
close
around
the
fire
the
animals
hobbled
with
double
ropes
front
feet
to
hind
feet
shifted
uneasily
and
let
out
long
uncanny
whines
i
heard
cuinn
pacing
behind
me
i
heard
a
rustle
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
a
stir
and
whisper
beyond
the
trees
and
turned
to
speak
to
him
then
saw
him
slipping
away
toward
the
outskirts
of
the
clearing
for
a
moment
i
thought
nothing
of
it
thinking
that
he
was
taking
a
few
steps
toward
the
gap
in
the
trees
where
he
had
disappeared
i
suppose
i
had
the
idea
that
he
had
slipped
away
to
investigate
some
noise
or
shadow
and
that
i
should
be
at
hand
then
i
saw
the
flicker
of
lights
beyond
the
trees
light
from
the
lantern
cuinn
had
been
carrying
in
his
hand
he
was
signaling
i
slipped
the
safety
clasp
from
the
hilt
of
my
skean
and
went
after
him
in
the
dimming
glow
of
the
fire
i
fancied
i
saw
luminous
eyes
watching
me
and
the
skin
on
my
back
crawled
i
crept
up
behind
him
and
leaped
we
went
down
in
a
tangle
of
flailing
legs
and
arms
and
in
less
than
a
second
he
had
his
skean
out
and
i
was
gripping
his
wrist
trying
desperately
to
force
the
blade
away
from
my
throat
i
gasped
do
be
a
fool
one
yell
and
the
whole
camp
will
be
awake
who
were
you
signaling
in
the
light
of
the
fallen
lantern
lips
drawn
back
in
a
snarl
he
looked
almost
inhuman
he
strained
at
the
knife
for
a
moment
then
dropped
it
let
me
up
he
said
i
got
up
and
kicked
the
fallen
skean
toward
him
put
that
away
what
in
hell
were
you
doing
trying
to
bring
the
catmen
down
on
us
for
a
moment
he
looked
taken
aback
then
his
fierce
face
closed
down
again
and
he
said
wrathfully
ca
a
man
walk
away
from
the
camp
without
being
half
strangled
i
glared
at
him
but
realized
i
really
had
nothing
to
go
by
he
might
have
been
answering
a
call
of
nature
and
the
movement
of
the
lantern
accidental
and
if
someone
had
jumped
me
from
behind
i
might
have
pulled
a
knife
on
him
myself
so
i
only
said
do
do
it
again
all
too
jumpy
there
were
no
other
incidents
that
night
or
the
next
the
night
after
while
i
lay
huddled
in
my
shirtcloak
and
blanket
by
the
fire
i
saw
cuinn
slip
out
of
his
bedroll
and
steal
away
a
moment
later
there
was
a
gleam
in
the
darkness
but
before
i
could
summon
the
resolve
to
get
up
and
face
it
out
with
him
he
returned
looked
cautiously
at
the
snoring
men
and
crawled
back
into
his
blankets
while
we
were
unpacking
at
the
next
camp
kyral
halted
beside
me
heard
anything
queer
lately
i
got
the
notion
we
being
trailed
we
be
out
of
these
forests
tomorrow
and
after
that
it
clear
road
all
the
way
to
shainsa
if
anything
going
to
happen
it
will
happen
tonight
i
debated
speaking
to
him
about
cuinn
signals
no
i
had
my
own
business
waiting
for
me
in
shainsa
why
mix
myself
up
in
some
other
private
intrigue
he
said
i
putting
you
and
cuinn
on
watch
again
the
old
men
doze
off
and
the
young
fellows
get
to
daydreaming
or
fooling
around
all
right
most
of
the
time
but
i
want
someone
who
keep
his
eyes
open
tonight
did
you
ever
know
cuinn
before
this
never
set
eyes
on
him
funny
i
had
the
notion
he
shrugged
turned
away
then
stopped
do
think
twice
about
rousing
the
camp
if
there
any
disturbance
better
a
false
alarm
than
an
ambush
that
catches
us
all
in
our
blankets
if
it
came
to
a
fight
we
might
be
in
a
bad
way
we
all
carry
skeans
but
i
do
think
there
a
shocker
in
the
whole
camp
let
alone
a
gun
you
do
have
one
by
any
chance
after
the
men
had
turned
in
cuinn
patrolling
the
camp
halted
a
minute
beside
me
and
cocked
his
head
toward
the
rustling
forest
what
going
on
in
there
who
knows
catmen
on
the
prowl
probably
thinking
the
horses
would
make
a
good
meal
or
maybe
that
we
would
think
it
will
come
to
a
fight
i
would
know
he
surveyed
me
for
a
moment
without
speaking
and
if
it
did
we
fight
then
i
sucked
in
my
breath
for
cuinn
had
spoken
terran
standard
and
i
without
thinking
had
answered
in
the
same
language
he
grinned
showing
white
teeth
filed
to
a
point
i
thought
so
i
seized
his
shoulder
and
demanded
roughly
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
that
depends
on
you
he
answered
and
what
you
want
in
shainsa
tell
me
the
truth
what
were
you
doing
in
the
terran
zone
he
gave
me
no
chance
to
answer
you
know
who
kyral
is
do
you
a
trader
i
said
who
pays
my
wages
and
minds
his
own
affairs
i
moved
backward
hand
on
my
skean
braced
for
a
sudden
rush
he
made
no
aggressive
motion
however
kyral
told
me
you
been
asking
questions
about
rakhal
sensar
he
said
clever
now
i
for
one
could
have
told
you
he
never
set
eyes
on
rakhal
i
he
broke
off
hearing
a
noise
in
the
forest
a
long
eerie
howl
i
muttered
if
you
brought
them
down
on
us
he
shook
his
head
urgently
i
had
to
take
that
chance
to
get
word
to
the
others
it
wo
work
where
the
girl
i
hardly
heard
him
i
was
hearing
twigs
snap
and
silent
sneaking
feet
i
turned
for
a
yell
that
would
rouse
the
camp
and
cuinn
grabbed
me
hard
saying
insistently
quick
where
the
girl
go
back
and
tell
her
it
wo
work
if
kyral
suspected
he
never
finished
the
sentence
just
behind
us
came
another
of
the
long
eerie
howls
i
knocked
cuinn
away
and
suddenly
the
night
was
filled
with
crouching
forms
that
came
down
on
us
like
a
whirlwind
i
shouted
madly
as
the
camp
came
alive
with
men
struggling
out
of
blankets
fighting
for
life
itself
i
ran
hard
still
shouting
for
the
enclosure
where
we
had
tied
the
horses
a
catman
slim
and
was
crouched
and
cutting
the
of
the
nearest
animal
i
hurled
myself
on
him
he
exploded
clawing
raking
my
shoulder
with
talons
that
ripped
the
rough
cloth
like
paper
i
whipped
out
my
skean
and
slashed
upward
the
talons
contracted
in
my
shoulder
and
i
gasped
with
pain
then
the
thing
howled
and
fell
away
clawing
at
the
air
it
twitched
and
lay
still
four
shots
in
rapid
succession
cracked
in
the
clearing
kyral
to
the
contrary
someone
must
have
had
a
pistol
i
heard
one
of
the
wail
a
hoarse
dying
rattle
something
dark
clawed
my
arm
and
i
slashed
with
the
knife
going
down
as
another
set
of
talons
fastened
in
my
back
rolling
and
clutching
i
managed
to
get
the
thing
forelimbs
wedged
under
my
elbow
my
knee
in
its
spine
i
heaved
bent
it
backward
backward
till
it
screamed
a
high
wail
then
i
felt
the
spine
snap
and
the
dead
thing
mewled
once
just
air
escaping
from
collapsing
lungs
and
slid
limp
from
my
thigh
erect
it
had
not
been
over
four
feet
tall
and
in
the
light
of
the
dying
fire
it
might
have
been
a
dead
lynx
rascar
i
heard
a
gasp
a
groan
i
whirled
and
saw
kyral
go
down
struggling
drowning
in
half
a
dozen
or
more
of
the
fierce
i
leaped
at
the
smother
of
bodies
ripped
one
away
with
a
stranglehold
slashed
at
its
throat
they
were
easy
to
kill
i
heard
a
high
urgent
scream
in
their
mewing
tongue
then
the
furred
black
things
seemed
to
melt
into
the
forest
as
silently
as
they
had
come
kyral
dazed
his
forehead
running
blood
his
arm
slashed
to
the
bone
was
sitting
on
the
ground
still
stunned
somebody
had
to
take
charge
i
bellowed
lights
get
lights
they
come
back
if
we
have
enough
light
they
can
only
see
well
in
the
dark
someone
stirred
the
fire
it
blazed
up
as
they
piled
on
dead
branches
and
i
roughly
commanded
one
of
the
kids
to
fill
every
lantern
he
could
find
and
get
them
burning
four
of
the
dead
things
were
lying
in
the
clearing
the
youngster
i
helped
loading
horses
the
first
day
gazed
down
at
one
of
the
catmen
by
somebody
skean
and
suddenly
bolted
for
the
bushes
where
i
heard
him
retching
i
set
the
others
with
stronger
stomachs
to
dragging
the
bodies
away
from
the
clearing
and
went
back
to
see
how
badly
kyral
was
hurt
he
had
the
rip
in
his
arm
and
his
face
was
covered
with
blood
from
a
shallow
scalp
wound
but
he
insisted
on
getting
up
to
inspect
the
hurts
of
the
others
there
was
no
one
without
a
in
leg
or
back
or
shoulder
but
none
were
serious
and
we
were
all
feeling
fairly
cheerful
when
someone
demanded
where
cuinn
he
did
seem
to
be
anywhere
kyral
staggering
slightly
insisted
on
searching
but
i
felt
we
would
find
him
he
probably
went
off
with
his
friends
i
snorted
and
told
about
the
signaling
kyral
looked
grave
you
should
have
told
me
he
began
but
shouts
from
the
far
end
of
the
clearing
sent
us
racing
there
we
nearly
stumbled
over
a
single
solitary
motionless
form
outstretched
and
lifeless
blind
eyes
staring
upward
at
the
moons
it
was
cuinn
and
his
throat
had
been
torn
completely
out
chapter
six
once
we
were
free
of
the
forest
the
road
to
the
lay
straight
before
us
with
no
hidden
dangers
some
of
us
limped
for
a
day
or
two
or
favored
an
arm
or
leg
clawed
by
the
catmen
but
i
knew
that
what
kyral
said
was
true
it
was
a
lucky
caravan
which
had
to
fight
off
only
one
attack
cuinn
haunted
me
a
night
or
two
of
turning
over
his
cryptic
words
in
my
mind
had
convinced
me
that
whoever
or
whatever
he
been
signaling
it
was
the
catmen
and
his
urgent
question
where
the
girl
swam
endlessly
in
my
brain
making
no
more
sense
than
when
i
had
first
heard
it
who
had
he
mistaken
me
for
what
did
he
think
i
was
mixed
up
in
and
who
above
all
were
the
others
who
had
to
be
signaled
at
the
risk
of
an
attack
by
catmen
which
had
meant
his
own
death
with
cuinn
dead
and
kyral
thinking
i
saved
his
life
a
large
part
of
the
responsibility
for
the
caravan
now
fell
on
me
and
strangely
i
enjoyed
it
making
the
most
of
this
interval
when
i
was
separated
from
the
thought
of
or
revenge
the
need
of
spying
or
the
threat
of
exposure
during
those
days
and
nights
on
the
trail
i
grew
back
slowly
into
the
i
once
had
been
i
knew
i
would
be
sorry
when
the
walls
of
shainsa
rose
on
the
horizon
bringing
me
back
inescapably
to
my
own
quest
we
swung
wide
leaving
the
straight
trail
to
shainsa
and
kyral
announced
his
intention
of
stopping
for
half
a
day
at
canarsa
one
of
the
walled
nonhuman
cities
which
lay
well
off
the
traveled
road
to
my
inadvertent
show
of
surprise
he
returned
that
he
had
trading
connections
there
we
all
need
a
day
rest
and
the
silent
ones
will
buy
from
me
though
they
have
few
dealings
with
men
look
here
i
owe
you
something
you
have
lenses
you
can
get
a
better
price
in
canarsa
than
you
get
in
ardcarran
or
shainsa
come
along
with
me
and
i
vouch
for
you
kyral
had
been
most
friendly
since
the
night
i
had
dug
him
out
from
under
the
catmen
and
i
knew
no
way
to
refuse
without
exposing
myself
for
the
sham
trader
i
was
but
i
was
deathly
apprehensive
even
with
rakhal
i
had
never
entered
any
of
the
nonhuman
towns
on
wolf
human
and
nonhuman
have
lived
side
by
side
for
centuries
and
the
human
is
not
always
the
superior
being
i
might
pass
among
the
and
the
relatively
stupid
humanoid
for
another
but
rakhal
had
cautioned
me
i
could
not
pass
among
nonhumans
for
native
wolfan
and
warned
me
against
trying
nevertheless
i
accompanied
kyral
carrying
the
box
which
had
cost
about
a
week
pay
in
the
terran
zone
and
was
worth
a
small
fortune
in
the
canarsa
seemed
inside
the
gates
like
any
other
town
the
houses
were
round
beehive
fashion
and
the
streets
totally
empty
just
inside
the
gates
a
hooded
figure
greeted
us
and
gestured
us
by
signs
to
follow
him
he
was
covered
from
head
to
foot
with
some
coarse
and
shiny
fiber
woven
into
stuff
that
looked
like
sacking
but
under
the
thick
hooding
was
horror
it
slithered
and
it
had
nothing
like
a
recognizable
human
shape
or
walk
and
i
felt
the
primeval
ape
in
me
cowering
and
gibbering
in
a
corner
of
my
brain
kyral
muttered
close
to
my
ear
no
outsider
is
ever
allowed
to
look
on
the
silent
ones
in
their
real
form
i
think
they
deaf
and
dumb
but
be
damn
careful
you
bet
i
whispered
and
was
glad
the
streets
were
empty
i
walked
along
trying
not
to
look
at
the
gliding
motion
of
that
shrouded
thing
up
ahead
the
trading
was
done
in
an
open
hut
of
reeds
which
looked
as
if
it
had
been
built
in
a
hurry
and
was
not
square
round
hexagonal
or
any
other
recognizable
geometrical
shape
it
formed
a
pattern
of
its
own
presumably
but
my
human
eyes
could
see
it
kyral
said
in
a
breath
of
a
whisper
they
tear
it
down
and
burn
it
after
we
leave
supposed
to
have
contaminated
it
too
greatly
for
any
of
the
silent
ones
ever
to
enter
again
my
family
has
traded
with
them
for
centuries
and
we
almost
the
only
ones
who
have
ever
entered
the
city
then
two
of
the
silent
ones
of
canarsa
also
covered
with
that
coarse
shiny
stuff
slithered
into
the
hut
and
kyral
choked
off
his
words
as
if
he
had
swallowed
them
it
was
the
strangest
trading
i
had
ever
done
kyral
laid
out
the
small
tools
and
the
coils
of
thin
fine
wire
and
i
unpacked
my
lenses
and
laid
them
out
in
neat
rows
the
silent
ones
neither
spoke
nor
moved
but
through
a
thin
place
in
the
gray
veiling
i
saw
a
speck
which
might
have
been
a
phosphorescent
eye
moving
back
and
forth
as
if
scanning
the
things
laid
out
for
their
inspection
then
i
smothered
a
gasp
for
suddenly
blank
spaces
appeared
in
the
rows
of
merchandise
certain
small
tools
wirecutters
calipers
surgical
scissors
had
vanished
and
all
the
coils
of
wire
had
disappeared
blanks
equally
had
appeared
in
the
rows
of
lenses
all
of
my
tiny
powerful
microscope
lenses
had
vanished
i
cast
a
quick
glance
at
kyral
but
he
seemed
unsurprised
i
recalled
vague
rumors
of
the
silent
ones
and
concluded
that
eerie
though
it
seemed
this
was
merely
their
way
of
doing
business
kyral
pointed
at
one
of
the
tools
at
an
exceptionally
fine
pair
of
binocular
lenses
at
the
last
of
the
coils
of
wire
the
shrouded
ones
did
not
move
but
the
lenses
and
the
wire
vanished
the
small
tool
remained
and
after
a
moment
kyral
dropped
his
hand
i
took
my
cue
from
kyral
and
remained
motionless
awaiting
whatever
surprise
was
coming
i
had
halfway
expected
what
happened
next
in
the
blank
spaces
little
points
of
light
began
to
glimmer
and
after
a
moment
blue
and
red
and
green
appeared
there
to
me
the
substitution
appeared
roughly
equitable
and
fair
though
i
am
no
judge
of
the
fine
points
of
gems
kyral
scowled
slightly
and
pointed
to
one
of
the
green
gems
and
after
a
moment
it
whisked
away
and
a
blue
one
took
its
place
in
another
spot
where
a
fine
set
of
surgical
instruments
had
lain
kyral
pointed
at
the
blue
gem
which
now
lay
there
shook
his
head
and
held
out
three
fingers
after
a
moment
a
second
blue
stone
lay
winking
beside
the
first
kyral
did
not
move
but
inexorably
held
out
the
three
fingers
there
was
a
little
swirling
in
the
air
and
then
both
gems
vanished
and
the
case
of
surgical
instruments
lay
in
their
place
still
kyral
did
not
move
but
held
the
three
fingers
out
for
a
full
minute
finally
he
dropped
them
and
bent
to
pick
up
the
case
instruments
again
the
little
swirl
in
the
air
and
the
instruments
vanished
in
their
place
lay
three
of
the
blue
gems
my
mouth
twitched
in
the
first
amusement
i
had
felt
since
we
entered
this
uncanny
place
evidently
bargaining
with
the
silent
ones
was
not
a
great
deal
different
than
bargaining
with
anyone
anywhere
nevertheless
under
the
eyes
of
those
shrouded
but
horrible
forms
if
they
had
eyes
which
i
doubted
i
had
no
impulse
to
protest
their
offered
prices
i
gathered
up
the
rejected
lenses
repacked
them
neatly
and
helped
kyral
recrate
the
tools
and
instruments
the
silent
ones
had
not
wanted
i
noticed
that
in
addition
to
the
microscope
lenses
and
surgical
instruments
they
had
taken
all
the
fine
wire
i
could
imagine
and
did
particularly
want
to
imagine
what
they
intended
to
do
with
it
on
our
way
back
through
the
streets
unshepherded
this
time
tongue
was
loosened
as
if
with
a
great
release
from
tension
psychokinetics
he
told
me
quite
a
few
of
the
nonhuman
races
are
i
guess
they
have
to
be
having
no
eyes
and
no
hands
but
sometimes
i
wonder
if
we
of
the
ought
to
deal
with
them
at
all
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
not
really
listening
i
was
thinking
mostly
about
the
way
the
small
objects
had
melted
away
and
reappeared
the
sight
had
stirred
some
uncomfortable
memory
a
vague
sense
of
danger
it
was
not
tangible
enough
for
me
to
know
why
i
feared
it
but
just
a
subliminal
uneasiness
that
kept
prodding
at
me
like
a
tooth
that
quite
aching
yet
kyral
said
we
of
shainsa
live
between
fire
and
flood
terra
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
maybe
something
worse
who
knows
we
know
so
little
about
the
silent
ones
and
those
like
them
who
knows
maybe
we
giving
them
the
weapons
to
destroy
us
he
broke
off
with
a
gasp
and
stood
staring
down
one
of
the
streets
it
lay
open
and
bare
between
two
rows
of
round
houses
and
kyral
was
staring
fixedly
at
a
doorway
which
had
opened
there
i
followed
his
paralyzed
gaze
and
saw
the
girl
hair
like
spun
black
glass
fell
in
hard
waves
around
her
shoulders
and
the
red
eyes
smiled
with
alien
malice
alien
mischief
beneath
the
dark
crown
of
little
stars
and
the
toad
god
sprawled
in
hideous
embroideries
across
the
white
folds
of
her
breast
kyral
gulped
hoarsely
his
hand
flew
up
as
he
clutched
the
charms
strung
about
his
neck
i
imitated
the
gesture
mechanically
watching
kyral
wondering
if
he
would
turn
and
run
again
but
he
stood
frozen
for
a
minute
then
the
spell
broke
and
he
took
one
step
toward
the
girl
arms
outstretched
miellyn
he
cried
and
there
was
heartbreak
in
his
voice
and
again
the
cry
making
ringing
echoes
in
the
strange
street
miellyn
this
time
it
was
the
girl
who
whirled
and
fled
her
white
robes
fluttered
and
i
saw
the
twinkle
of
her
flying
feet
as
she
vanished
into
a
space
between
the
houses
and
was
gone
kyral
took
one
blind
step
down
the
street
then
another
but
before
he
could
burst
into
a
run
i
had
him
by
the
arm
dragging
him
back
to
sanity
man
you
gone
mad
chase
in
a
nonhuman
town
he
struggled
for
a
minute
then
with
a
harsh
sigh
he
said
it
all
right
i
wo
and
shook
loose
from
my
arm
he
did
not
speak
again
until
we
reached
the
gates
of
canarsa
and
they
closed
silently
and
untouched
behind
us
i
had
forgotten
the
place
already
i
had
space
only
to
think
of
the
girl
whose
face
i
had
not
forgotten
since
the
moment
when
she
saved
me
and
disappeared
now
she
had
appeared
again
to
kyral
what
did
it
all
mean
i
asked
as
we
walked
toward
the
camp
do
you
know
that
girl
but
i
knew
the
question
was
futile
kyral
face
was
closed
conceding
nothing
and
his
friendliness
had
vanished
completely
he
said
now
i
know
you
you
saved
me
from
the
catmen
and
again
in
canarsa
so
my
hands
are
bound
from
harming
you
but
it
is
evil
to
have
dealings
with
those
who
have
been
touched
by
the
toad
god
he
spat
noisily
on
the
ground
looked
at
me
with
loathing
and
said
we
will
reach
shainsa
in
three
days
stay
away
from
me
chapter
seven
shainsa
first
in
the
chain
of
that
lie
in
the
bed
of
a
ocean
is
set
at
the
center
of
a
great
alkali
plain
a
dusty
parched
city
bleached
by
a
million
years
of
sun
the
houses
are
high
spreading
buildings
with
many
rooms
and
wide
windows
the
poorer
sort
were
made
of
brick
the
more
imposing
being
cut
from
the
bleached
salt
stone
of
the
cliffs
that
rise
behind
the
city
news
travels
fast
in
the
if
rakhal
were
in
the
city
soon
know
that
i
was
here
and
guess
who
i
was
or
why
i
come
i
might
disguise
myself
so
that
my
own
sister
or
the
mother
who
bore
me
would
not
know
me
but
i
had
no
illusions
about
my
ability
to
disguise
myself
from
rakhal
he
had
created
the
disguise
that
was
me
when
the
second
sun
set
red
and
burning
behind
the
salt
cliffs
i
knew
he
was
not
in
shainsa
but
i
stayed
on
waiting
for
something
to
happen
at
night
i
slept
in
a
cubbyhole
behind
a
wineshop
paying
an
inordinate
price
for
that
very
dubious
privilege
and
every
day
in
the
sleepy
silence
of
the
noon
i
paced
the
public
square
of
shainsa
this
went
on
for
four
days
no
one
took
the
slightest
notice
of
another
nameless
man
in
a
shabby
shirtcloak
without
name
or
identity
or
known
business
no
one
appeared
to
see
me
except
the
dusty
children
with
pale
fleecy
hair
who
played
their
patient
games
on
the
windswept
curbing
of
the
square
they
surveyed
my
scarred
face
with
neither
curiosity
or
fear
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
rindy
might
be
such
another
as
these
if
i
had
still
been
thinking
like
an
earthman
i
might
have
tried
to
question
one
of
the
children
or
win
their
confidence
but
i
had
a
deeper
game
in
hand
on
the
fifth
day
i
was
so
much
a
fixture
that
my
pacing
went
unnoticed
even
by
the
children
on
the
gray
moss
of
the
square
a
few
old
men
their
faces
as
faded
as
their
shirtcloaks
and
bearing
the
knife
scars
of
a
hundred
forgotten
fights
drowsed
on
the
stone
benches
and
along
the
flagged
walk
at
the
edge
of
the
square
as
suddenly
as
an
autumn
storm
in
the
salt
flats
a
woman
came
walking
she
was
tall
with
a
proud
swinging
walk
and
a
metallic
clashing
kept
rhythm
to
her
swift
steps
her
arms
were
fettered
each
wrist
bound
with
a
jeweled
bracelet
and
the
bracelets
linked
together
by
a
long
chain
passed
through
a
silken
loop
at
her
waist
from
the
loop
swung
a
tiny
golden
padlock
but
in
the
lock
stood
an
even
tinier
key
signifying
that
she
was
a
higher
caste
than
her
husband
or
consort
that
her
fettering
was
by
choice
and
not
command
she
stopped
directly
before
me
and
raised
her
arm
in
formal
greeting
like
a
man
the
chain
made
a
tinkling
sound
in
the
hushed
square
as
her
other
hand
was
pulled
up
tight
against
the
silken
loop
at
her
waist
she
stood
surveying
me
for
some
moments
and
finally
i
raised
my
head
and
returned
her
gaze
i
do
know
why
i
had
expected
her
to
have
hair
like
spun
black
glass
and
eyes
that
burned
with
a
red
reflection
of
the
burning
star
this
woman
eyes
were
darker
than
the
of
the
salt
cliffs
and
her
mouth
was
a
cut
berry
that
looked
just
as
dangerous
she
was
young
the
slimness
of
her
shoulders
and
the
narrow
wrists
told
me
how
very
young
she
was
but
her
face
had
seen
weather
and
storms
and
her
dark
eyes
had
weathered
worse
psychic
storms
than
that
she
did
not
flinch
at
the
sight
of
my
scars
and
met
my
gaze
without
dropping
her
eyes
you
are
a
stranger
what
is
your
business
in
shainsa
i
met
the
direct
question
with
the
insolence
it
demanded
hardly
moving
my
lips
i
have
come
to
buy
women
for
the
brothels
of
ardcarran
perhaps
when
washed
you
might
be
suitable
who
could
arrange
for
your
sale
she
took
the
rebuke
impassively
though
the
bitter
crimson
of
her
mouth
twitched
a
little
in
mischief
or
rage
but
she
made
no
sign
the
battle
was
joined
between
us
and
i
knew
already
that
it
would
be
fought
to
the
end
from
somewhere
in
her
draperies
something
fell
to
the
ground
with
a
little
tinkle
but
i
knew
that
trick
too
and
i
did
not
move
finally
she
went
away
without
bending
to
retrieve
it
and
when
i
looked
around
i
saw
that
all
the
children
had
stolen
away
leaving
their
playthings
lying
on
the
curbing
but
one
or
two
of
the
gaffers
on
the
stone
benches
who
were
old
enough
to
show
curiosity
without
losing
face
were
watching
me
with
impassive
eyes
i
could
have
asked
the
woman
name
then
but
i
held
back
knowing
it
could
only
lessen
the
prestige
i
had
gained
from
the
encounter
i
glanced
down
without
seeming
to
do
so
at
the
tiny
mirror
which
had
fallen
from
the
recesses
of
the
fur
robe
her
name
might
have
been
inscribed
on
the
reverse
but
i
left
it
lying
there
to
be
picked
up
by
the
children
when
they
returned
and
went
back
to
the
wineshop
i
had
accomplished
my
first
objective
if
you
ca
be
inconspicuous
be
so
damned
conspicuous
that
nobody
can
miss
you
and
that
in
itself
is
a
fair
concealment
how
many
people
can
accurately
describe
a
street
riot
i
was
finishing
off
a
bad
meal
with
a
stone
bottle
of
worse
wine
when
the
came
in
disregarding
the
proprietor
and
made
straight
for
me
he
was
furred
immaculately
white
his
velvet
muzzle
was
contracted
as
if
the
very
smells
might
soil
it
and
he
kept
a
dainty
paw
outstretched
to
ward
off
accidental
contact
with
greasy
counters
or
tables
or
tapestries
his
fur
was
scented
and
his
throat
circled
with
a
collar
of
embroidered
silk
this
pampered
minion
surveyed
me
with
the
innocent
malice
of
an
uninvolved
nonhuman
for
merely
human
intrigues
you
are
wanted
in
the
great
house
of
shanitha
thcarred
man
he
spoke
the
shainsa
dialect
with
an
affected
lisp
will
it
pleathe
you
come
wis
me
i
came
with
no
more
than
polite
protest
but
was
startled
i
had
not
expected
the
encounter
to
reach
the
great
house
so
soon
shainsa
great
house
had
changed
hands
four
times
since
i
had
last
been
in
shainsa
i
was
overly
anxious
to
appear
there
the
white
as
out
of
place
in
the
rough
as
a
jewel
in
the
streets
or
a
raindrop
in
the
desert
led
me
along
a
winding
boulevard
to
an
outlying
district
he
made
no
attempt
to
engage
me
in
conversation
and
indeed
i
got
the
distinct
impression
that
this
cockscomb
of
a
nonhuman
considered
me
well
beneath
his
notice
he
seemed
much
more
aware
of
the
blowing
dust
in
the
street
which
ruffled
and
smudged
his
carefully
combed
fur
the
great
house
was
carved
from
blocks
of
rough
pink
basalt
the
entry
guarded
by
two
great
caryatids
enwrapped
in
chains
of
carved
metal
set
somehow
into
the
surface
of
the
basalt
the
gilt
had
long
ago
worn
away
from
the
chains
so
that
it
alternately
gleamed
gold
or
smudged
base
metal
the
caryatids
were
patient
and
blind
their
long
vanished
under
a
hotter
sun
than
today
the
entrance
hall
was
enormous
a
terran
starship
could
have
stood
upright
inside
it
was
my
first
impression
but
i
dismissed
that
thought
quickly
any
terran
thought
was
apt
to
betray
me
but
the
main
hall
was
built
on
a
scale
even
more
huge
and
it
was
even
colder
than
the
legendary
hell
of
the
it
was
far
too
big
for
the
people
in
it
there
was
a
little
solar
heater
in
the
ceiling
but
it
did
help
much
a
dim
glow
came
from
a
metal
brazier
but
that
did
help
much
either
the
melted
into
the
shadows
and
i
went
down
the
steps
into
the
hall
by
myself
feeling
carefully
for
each
step
with
my
feet
and
trying
not
to
seem
to
be
doing
so
my
comparative
is
the
only
significant
way
in
which
i
really
differ
from
a
native
wolfan
there
were
three
men
two
women
and
a
child
in
the
room
they
were
all
and
had
an
obscure
family
likeness
and
they
all
wore
rich
garments
of
fur
dyed
in
many
colors
one
of
the
men
old
and
stooped
and
withered
was
doing
something
to
the
brazier
a
slim
boy
of
fourteen
was
sitting
on
a
pile
of
cushions
in
the
corner
there
was
something
wrong
with
his
legs
a
girl
of
ten
in
a
smock
that
showed
long
legs
above
her
low
leather
boots
was
playing
with
some
sort
of
shimmery
crystals
spilling
them
out
into
patterns
and
scooping
them
up
again
from
the
uneven
stones
of
the
floor
one
of
the
women
was
a
fat
creased
slattern
whose
jewels
and
dyed
furs
did
not
disguise
her
greasy
slovenliness
her
hands
were
unchained
and
she
was
biting
into
a
fruit
which
dripped
red
juice
down
the
rich
blue
fur
of
her
robe
the
old
man
gave
her
a
look
like
murder
as
i
came
in
and
she
straightened
slightly
but
did
not
discard
the
fruit
the
whole
room
had
a
curious
look
of
austere
dignified
poverty
to
which
the
fat
woman
was
the
only
discordant
note
but
it
was
the
remaining
man
and
woman
who
drew
my
attention
so
that
i
noticed
the
others
only
peripherally
in
their
outermost
orbit
one
was
kyral
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
dais
and
glowering
at
me
the
other
was
the
woman
i
had
rebuked
today
in
the
public
square
kyral
said
so
it
you
and
his
voice
held
nothing
not
rebuke
not
friendliness
or
a
lack
of
it
not
even
hatred
nothing
there
was
only
one
way
to
meet
it
i
faced
the
girl
she
was
sitting
on
a
thronelike
chair
next
to
the
fat
woman
and
looked
like
a
doe
next
to
a
pig
and
said
boldly
i
assume
this
summons
to
mean
that
you
informed
your
kinsmen
of
my
offer
she
flushed
and
that
was
triumph
enough
i
held
back
the
triumph
however
wary
of
overconfidence
the
gaffer
laughed
the
high
cackle
of
age
and
kyral
broke
in
with
a
sharp
angry
monosyllable
by
which
i
knew
that
my
remark
had
indeed
been
repeated
and
had
lost
nothing
in
the
telling
but
only
the
line
of
his
jaw
betrayed
the
anger
as
he
said
calmly
be
quiet
dallisa
where
did
you
pick
this
up
i
said
boldly
the
great
house
has
changed
rulers
since
last
i
smelled
the
salt
cliffs
newcomers
do
not
know
my
name
and
theirs
is
unknown
to
me
the
old
gaffer
said
thinly
to
kyral
our
name
has
lost
one
daughter
is
lured
away
by
the
toymaker
and
another
babbles
with
strangers
in
the
square
and
a
homeless
of
the
streets
does
not
know
our
name
my
eyes
growing
accustomed
to
the
dark
blaze
of
the
brazier
saw
that
kyral
was
biting
his
lip
and
scowling
then
he
gestured
to
a
table
where
an
array
of
glassware
was
set
and
at
the
gesture
the
white
came
on
noiseless
feet
and
poured
wine
if
you
have
no
with
my
family
will
you
drink
with
me
i
will
i
said
relaxing
even
if
he
had
associated
the
trader
with
the
scarred
earthman
of
the
spaceport
he
seemed
to
have
decided
to
drop
the
matter
he
seemed
startled
but
he
waited
until
i
had
lifted
the
glass
and
taken
a
sip
then
with
a
movement
like
lightning
he
leaped
from
the
dais
and
struck
the
glass
from
my
lips
i
staggered
back
wiping
my
cut
mouth
in
a
juggling
possibilities
the
insult
was
terrible
and
deadly
i
could
do
nothing
now
but
fight
men
had
been
murdered
in
shainsa
for
far
less
i
had
come
to
settle
one
feud
not
involve
myself
in
another
but
even
while
these
lightning
thoughts
flickered
in
my
mind
i
had
whipped
out
my
skean
and
i
was
surprised
at
the
shrillness
of
my
own
voice
you
contrive
offense
beneath
your
own
roof
spy
and
renegade
kyral
thundered
he
did
not
touch
his
skean
from
the
table
he
caught
a
long
whip
making
it
whistle
through
the
air
the
child
scuttled
backward
i
stepped
back
one
pace
trying
to
conceal
my
desperate
puzzlement
i
could
not
guess
what
had
prompted
kyral
attack
but
whatever
it
was
i
must
have
made
some
bad
mistake
and
could
count
myself
lucky
to
get
out
of
there
alive
kyral
voice
perceptibly
trembled
with
rage
you
dare
to
come
into
my
own
home
after
i
have
tracked
you
to
the
kharsa
and
back
blind
fool
that
i
was
but
now
you
shall
pay
the
whip
sang
through
the
air
hissing
past
my
shoulders
i
dodged
to
one
side
retreating
step
by
step
as
kyral
swung
the
powerful
thongs
it
cracked
again
and
a
pain
like
the
burning
of
irons
seared
my
upper
arm
my
skean
rattled
down
from
numb
fingers
the
whip
whacked
the
floor
pick
up
your
skean
said
kyral
pick
it
up
if
you
dare
he
poised
the
lash
again
the
fat
woman
screamed
i
stood
rigid
gauging
my
chances
of
disarming
him
with
a
sudden
leap
suddenly
the
girl
dallisa
leaped
from
her
seat
with
a
harsh
musical
chiming
of
chains
kyral
no
no
kyral
he
moved
slightly
but
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
me
get
back
dallisa
no
wait
she
ran
to
him
and
caught
his
dragging
it
down
and
spoke
to
him
hurriedly
and
urgently
kyral
face
changed
as
she
spoke
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
threw
the
whip
down
beside
my
skean
on
the
floor
answer
straight
on
your
life
what
are
you
doing
in
shainsa
i
could
hardly
take
it
in
that
for
the
moment
i
was
reprieved
from
sudden
death
from
being
beaten
into
bloody
death
there
at
kyral
feet
the
girl
went
back
to
her
thronelike
chair
now
i
must
either
tell
the
truth
or
a
convincing
lie
and
i
was
lost
in
a
game
where
i
did
know
the
rules
the
explanation
i
thought
might
get
me
out
alive
might
be
the
very
one
which
would
bring
down
instant
and
painful
death
suddenly
with
a
poignancy
that
was
almost
pain
i
wished
rakhal
were
standing
here
at
my
side
but
i
had
to
bluff
it
out
alone
if
they
had
recognized
me
for
race
cargill
the
terran
spy
who
had
often
been
in
shainsa
they
might
release
me
it
was
possible
i
supposed
that
they
were
terran
sympathizers
on
the
other
hand
kyral
shouts
of
spy
renegade
seemed
to
suggest
the
opposite
i
stood
trying
to
ignore
the
searing
pain
in
my
lashed
arm
but
i
knew
that
blood
was
running
hot
down
my
shoulder
finally
i
said
i
came
to
settle
kyral
lips
thinned
in
what
might
have
been
meant
for
a
smile
you
shall
assuredly
but
with
whom
remains
to
be
seen
knowing
i
had
nothing
more
to
lose
i
said
with
a
renegade
called
rakhal
sensar
only
the
old
man
echoed
my
words
dully
rakhal
sensar
i
felt
heartened
seeing
i
was
dead
yet
i
have
sworn
to
kill
him
kyral
suddenly
clapped
his
hands
and
shouted
to
the
white
to
clean
up
the
broken
glass
on
the
floor
he
said
huskily
you
are
not
yourself
rakhal
sensar
i
you
he
was
said
dallisa
high
and
hysterically
i
you
he
was
a
scarred
man
tall
what
was
i
to
think
kyral
sounded
and
looked
badly
shaken
he
filled
a
glass
himself
and
handed
it
to
me
saying
hoarsely
i
did
not
believe
even
the
renegade
rakhal
would
break
the
code
so
far
as
to
drink
with
me
he
would
not
i
could
be
positive
about
this
the
codes
of
terra
had
made
some
superficial
impress
on
rakhal
but
down
deep
his
own
world
held
sway
if
these
men
were
at
with
rakhal
and
he
stood
here
where
i
stood
he
would
have
let
himself
be
beaten
into
bloody
rags
before
tasting
their
wine
i
took
the
glass
raised
it
and
drained
it
then
holding
it
out
before
me
i
said
rakhal
life
is
mine
but
i
swear
by
the
red
star
and
by
the
unmoving
mountains
by
the
black
snow
and
by
the
ghost
wind
i
have
no
quarrel
with
any
beneath
this
roof
i
cast
the
glass
to
the
floor
where
it
shattered
on
the
stones
kyral
hesitated
but
under
the
blazing
eyes
of
the
girl
he
quickly
poured
himself
a
glass
of
the
wine
and
drank
a
few
sips
then
flung
down
the
glass
he
stepped
forward
and
laid
his
hands
on
my
shoulders
i
winced
as
he
touched
the
welt
of
the
lash
and
could
not
raise
my
own
arm
to
complete
the
ceremonial
toast
kyral
stepped
away
and
shrugged
shall
i
have
one
of
the
women
see
to
your
hurt
he
looked
at
dallisa
but
she
twisted
her
mouth
do
it
yourself
it
is
nothing
i
said
not
truthfully
but
i
demand
in
requital
that
since
we
are
bound
by
spilled
blood
under
your
roof
that
you
give
me
what
news
you
have
of
rakhal
the
spy
and
renegade
kyral
said
fiercely
if
i
knew
would
i
be
under
my
own
roof
the
old
gaffer
on
the
dais
broke
into
shrill
whining
laughter
you
have
drunk
wi
him
kyral
now
he
bound
you
not
to
do
him
harm
i
know
the
story
of
rakhal
he
was
spy
for
terra
twelve
years
twelve
years
and
then
he
fought
and
flung
their
filthy
money
in
their
faces
and
left
but
his
partner
was
some
halfbreed
or
terran
spy
and
they
fought
wi
clawed
gloves
and
near
killed
one
another
except
the
terrans
who
have
no
honor
stopped
see
the
marks
of
the
on
his
face
by
sharra
the
said
kyral
gazing
at
me
with
something
like
a
grin
you
are
if
nothing
else
a
very
clever
man
what
are
you
spy
or
of
some
ardcarran
slut
what
i
am
does
matter
to
you
i
said
you
have
with
rakhal
but
mine
is
older
than
yours
and
his
life
is
mine
as
you
are
bound
in
honor
to
kill
the
formal
phrases
came
easily
now
to
my
tongue
the
earthman
had
slipped
away
so
you
are
bound
in
honor
to
help
me
kill
if
anyone
beneath
your
roof
knows
anything
of
rakhal
kyral
smile
bared
his
teeth
rakhal
works
against
the
son
of
the
ape
he
said
using
the
insulting
wolf
term
for
the
terrans
if
we
help
you
to
kill
him
we
remove
a
goad
from
their
flanks
i
prefer
to
let
the
filthy
spend
their
strength
trying
to
remove
it
themselves
moreover
i
believe
you
are
yourself
an
earthman
you
have
no
right
to
the
courtesy
i
extend
to
we
the
people
of
the
sky
yet
you
have
drunk
wine
with
me
and
i
have
no
quarrel
with
you
he
raised
his
hand
in
dismissal
outfencing
me
leave
my
roof
in
safety
and
my
city
with
honor
i
could
not
protest
or
plead
a
man
his
personal
dignity
is
a
precious
thing
in
shainsa
and
he
had
placed
me
so
i
could
not
compromise
mine
further
in
words
yet
i
lost
equally
if
i
left
at
his
bidding
like
an
inferior
dismissed
one
desperate
gamble
remained
a
word
i
said
raising
my
hand
and
while
he
half
turned
startled
believing
i
was
indeed
about
to
compromise
my
dignity
by
a
further
plea
i
flung
it
at
him
i
will
bet
with
you
his
iron
composure
looked
shaken
i
had
delivered
a
blow
to
his
belief
that
i
was
an
earthman
for
it
is
doubtful
if
there
are
six
earthmen
on
wolf
who
know
about
the
dangerous
game
of
the
it
is
no
ordinary
gamble
for
what
the
bettor
stakes
is
his
life
possibly
his
reason
rarely
indeed
will
a
man
bet
unless
he
has
nothing
further
to
lose
it
is
a
cruel
possibly
decadent
game
which
has
no
parallel
anywhere
in
the
known
universe
but
i
had
no
choice
i
had
struck
a
cold
trail
in
shainsa
rakhal
might
be
anywhere
on
the
planet
and
half
of
magnusson
month
was
already
up
unless
i
could
force
kyral
to
tell
what
he
knew
i
might
as
well
quit
so
i
repeated
i
will
bet
with
you
and
kyral
stood
unmoving
for
what
the
wagers
is
his
courage
and
endurance
in
the
face
of
torture
and
an
unknown
fate
on
his
side
the
stakes
are
clearly
determined
beforehand
but
if
he
loses
his
punishment
or
penalty
is
at
the
whim
of
the
one
who
has
accepted
him
and
he
may
be
put
to
whatever
doom
the
winner
determines
and
this
is
the
contest
the
permits
himself
to
be
tortured
from
sunrise
to
sunset
if
he
endures
he
wins
it
is
as
simple
as
that
he
can
stop
the
torture
at
any
moment
by
a
word
but
to
do
so
is
a
concession
of
defeat
this
is
not
as
dangerous
as
it
might
at
first
seem
the
other
party
to
the
bet
is
bound
by
the
ironclad
codes
of
wolf
to
inflict
no
permanent
physical
damage
no
injury
that
will
not
heal
with
three
suncourses
but
from
sunrise
to
sunset
any
torment
or
painful
ingenuity
which
the
mentality
of
wolf
can
devise
must
be
endured
the
man
who
can
outthink
the
torture
of
the
moment
the
man
who
can
hold
in
his
mind
the
single
thought
of
his
goal
that
man
can
claim
the
stakes
he
has
set
as
well
as
other
concessions
made
traditional
the
silence
grew
in
the
hall
dallisa
had
straightened
and
was
watching
me
intently
her
lips
parted
and
the
tip
of
a
little
red
tongue
visible
between
her
teeth
the
only
sound
was
the
tiny
crunching
as
the
fat
woman
nibbled
at
nuts
and
cast
their
shells
into
the
brazier
even
the
child
on
the
steps
had
abandoned
her
game
with
the
crystal
dice
and
sat
looking
up
at
me
with
her
mouth
open
finally
kyral
demanded
your
stakes
tell
me
all
you
know
of
rakhal
sensar
and
keep
silence
about
me
in
shainsa
by
the
red
shadow
kyral
burst
out
you
have
courage
rascar
say
only
yes
or
no
i
retorted
rebuked
he
fell
silent
dallisa
leaned
forward
and
again
for
some
unknown
reason
i
thought
of
a
girl
with
hair
like
spun
black
glass
kyral
raised
his
hand
i
say
no
i
have
with
rakhal
and
i
will
not
sell
his
death
to
another
further
i
believe
you
are
terran
and
i
will
not
deal
with
you
and
finally
you
have
twice
saved
my
life
and
i
would
find
small
pleasure
in
torturing
you
i
say
no
drink
again
with
me
and
we
part
without
a
quarrel
beaten
i
turned
to
go
wait
said
dallisa
she
stood
up
and
came
down
from
the
dais
slowly
this
time
walking
with
dignity
to
the
rhythm
of
her
musically
clashing
chains
i
have
a
quarrel
with
this
man
i
started
to
say
that
i
did
not
quarrel
with
women
and
stopped
myself
the
terran
concept
of
chivalry
has
no
equivalent
on
wolf
she
looked
at
me
with
her
dark
eyes
icy
and
level
and
amused
and
said
i
will
bet
with
you
unless
you
fear
me
rascar
and
i
knew
suddenly
that
if
i
lost
i
might
better
have
trusted
myself
to
kyral
and
his
whip
or
to
the
wild
of
the
mountains
chapter
eight
i
slept
little
that
night
there
is
a
tale
told
in
daillon
of
a
where
the
challenger
was
left
in
a
room
alone
where
he
was
blindfolded
and
told
to
await
the
beginning
of
the
torment
somewhere
in
those
dark
hours
of
waiting
between
the
unknown
and
the
unexpected
the
hours
of
telling
over
to
himself
the
horrors
of
past
the
torture
of
anticipation
alone
became
the
unbearable
a
little
past
noon
he
collapsed
in
screams
of
horror
and
died
raving
unmarred
untouched
daybreak
came
slowly
and
with
the
first
streamers
of
light
came
dallisa
and
the
white
maliciously
uninvolved
sniffing
his
way
through
the
shabby
poverty
of
the
great
hall
they
took
me
to
a
lower
dungeon
where
the
slant
of
the
sunlight
was
less
visible
dallisa
said
the
sun
has
risen
i
said
nothing
any
word
may
be
interpreted
as
a
confession
of
defeat
i
resolved
to
give
them
no
excuse
but
my
skin
crawled
and
i
had
that
peculiar
prickling
sensation
where
the
hair
on
my
forearms
was
bristling
erect
with
tension
and
fear
dallisa
said
to
the
his
gear
was
not
searched
see
that
he
has
swallowed
no
anesthetic
drugs
briefly
i
gave
her
credit
for
thoroughness
even
while
i
wondered
in
a
split
second
why
i
had
not
thought
of
this
drugs
could
blur
consciousness
at
least
or
suspend
reality
the
white
nonhuman
sprang
forward
and
pinioned
my
arms
with
one
strong
forearm
with
his
other
hand
he
forced
my
jaws
open
i
felt
the
furred
fingers
at
the
back
of
my
throat
gagged
struggled
briefly
and
doubled
up
in
uncontrollable
retching
dallisa
regarded
me
levelly
as
i
struggled
upright
fighting
off
the
dizzy
sickness
of
disgust
something
about
her
impassive
face
stopped
me
cold
i
had
been
momentarily
raging
with
fury
and
humiliation
now
i
realized
that
this
had
been
a
calculated
careful
gesture
to
make
me
lose
my
temper
and
thus
sap
my
resistance
if
she
could
set
me
to
fighting
if
she
could
make
me
spend
my
strength
in
rage
my
own
imagination
would
fight
on
her
side
to
make
me
lose
control
before
the
end
swimming
in
the
glare
of
her
eyes
i
realized
she
had
never
thought
for
a
moment
that
i
had
taken
any
drug
acting
on
kyral
hint
that
i
was
a
terran
she
was
taking
advantage
of
the
terran
revulsion
for
the
nonhuman
blindfold
him
dallisa
commanded
then
instantly
countermanded
that
no
strip
him
first
the
ripped
off
shirtcloak
shirt
shoes
breeches
and
i
had
my
first
triumph
when
the
wealed
clawmarks
on
my
shoulders
worse
if
possible
than
those
which
disfigured
my
face
were
laid
bare
the
screwed
up
his
muzzle
in
fastidious
horror
and
dallisa
looked
shaken
i
could
almost
read
her
thoughts
he
endured
this
what
hope
have
i
to
make
him
cry
mercy
briefly
i
remembered
the
months
i
lay
feverish
and
half
dead
waiting
for
the
wounds
rakhal
had
inflicted
to
heal
those
months
when
i
had
believed
that
nothing
would
ever
hurt
me
again
that
i
had
known
the
worst
of
all
suffering
but
i
had
been
younger
then
dallisa
had
picked
up
two
small
sharp
knives
she
weighed
them
briefly
gesturing
to
the
without
resisting
i
let
myself
be
manhandled
backward
spreadeagled
against
the
wall
dallisa
commanded
drive
the
knives
through
his
palms
to
the
wall
my
hands
twitched
convulsively
anticipating
the
slash
of
steel
and
my
throat
closed
in
spasmodic
dread
this
was
breaking
the
compact
bound
as
they
were
not
to
inflict
physical
damage
i
opened
my
lips
to
protest
this
breaking
of
the
bond
of
honor
and
met
her
dark
blazing
stare
and
suddenly
the
sweat
broke
out
on
my
forehead
i
had
placed
myself
wholly
in
their
hands
and
as
kyral
had
said
they
were
in
no
way
bound
by
honor
to
respect
a
pledge
to
a
terran
then
as
my
hands
clenched
into
fists
i
forced
myself
to
relax
this
was
a
bluff
a
mental
trick
to
needle
me
into
breaking
the
pact
and
pleading
for
mercy
i
set
my
lips
spread
my
palms
wide
against
the
wall
and
waited
impassively
she
said
in
her
lilting
voice
take
care
not
to
sever
the
tendons
or
his
hands
would
be
paralyzed
and
he
may
claim
we
have
broken
our
compact
the
points
of
the
steel
touched
my
palms
and
i
felt
blood
run
down
my
hand
before
the
pain
with
an
effort
that
turned
my
face
white
i
did
not
pull
away
from
the
point
the
knives
drove
deeper
dallisa
gestured
to
the
the
knives
dropped
two
pinpricks
a
quarter
of
an
inch
deep
stung
in
my
palm
i
had
outbluffed
her
had
i
if
i
had
expected
her
to
betray
disappointment
and
i
had
i
was
disappointed
abruptly
as
if
the
game
had
wearied
her
already
she
gestured
and
i
could
not
hold
back
a
gasp
as
my
arms
were
hauled
up
over
my
head
twisted
violently
around
one
another
and
trussed
with
thin
cords
that
bit
deep
into
the
flesh
then
the
rough
upward
pull
almost
jerked
my
shoulders
from
their
sockets
and
i
heard
the
giant
grunt
with
effort
as
i
was
hauled
upward
until
my
feet
barely
on
tiptoe
touched
the
floor
blindfold
him
said
dallisa
languidly
so
that
he
can
not
watch
the
ascent
of
the
sun
or
its
descent
or
know
what
is
to
come
a
dark
softness
muffled
my
eyes
after
a
little
i
heard
her
steps
retreating
my
arms
wrenched
overhead
and
numbed
with
the
bite
of
the
cords
were
beginning
to
hurt
badly
now
but
it
was
too
bad
surely
she
did
not
mean
that
this
should
be
all
sternly
i
controlled
my
imagination
taking
a
tight
rein
on
my
thoughts
there
was
only
one
way
to
meet
this
hanging
blind
and
racked
in
space
my
toes
barely
scrabbling
at
the
floor
and
that
was
to
take
each
thing
as
it
came
and
not
look
ahead
for
an
instant
first
of
all
i
tried
to
get
my
feet
under
me
and
discovered
that
by
arching
upwards
to
my
fullest
height
i
could
bear
my
weight
on
tiptoe
and
ease
a
little
the
dislocating
ache
in
my
armpits
by
slackening
the
overhead
rope
but
after
a
little
a
cramping
pain
began
to
flare
through
the
arches
of
my
feet
and
it
became
impossible
to
support
my
weight
on
tiptoe
i
jarred
down
with
violent
strain
on
my
wrists
and
wrenched
shoulders
again
and
for
a
moment
the
shooting
agony
was
so
intense
that
i
nearly
screamed
i
thought
i
heard
a
soft
breath
near
me
after
a
little
it
subsided
to
a
sharp
ache
then
to
a
dull
ache
and
then
to
the
violent
cramping
pain
again
and
once
more
i
struggled
to
get
my
toes
under
me
i
realized
that
by
allowing
my
toes
barely
to
touch
the
floor
they
had
doubled
and
tripled
the
pain
by
the
tantalizing
hope
of
if
not
momentary
relief
at
least
the
alteration
of
one
pain
for
another
i
have
the
faintest
idea
even
now
how
long
i
repeated
that
agonizing
cycle
struggle
for
a
toehold
on
rough
stone
scraping
my
bare
feet
raw
arch
upward
with
all
my
strength
to
release
for
a
few
moments
the
strain
on
my
wrenched
shoulders
the
momentary
illusion
of
relief
as
i
found
my
balance
and
the
pressure
lightened
on
my
wrists
then
the
slow
creeping
first
of
an
ache
then
of
a
pain
then
of
a
violent
agony
in
the
arches
of
feet
and
calves
and
delayed
to
the
last
endurable
moment
that
final
terrible
anguish
when
the
drop
of
my
full
weight
pulled
shoulder
and
wrist
and
elbow
joints
with
that
jerk
i
started
once
to
estimate
how
much
time
had
passed
how
many
hours
had
crawled
by
then
checked
myself
for
that
was
imminent
madness
but
once
the
process
had
begun
my
brain
would
not
abandon
and
i
found
myself
with
compulsive
precision
counting
off
the
seconds
and
the
minutes
in
each
cycle
stretch
upward
release
the
pressure
on
the
arms
the
beginning
of
pain
in
calves
and
arches
and
toes
the
creeping
of
pain
up
ribs
and
loins
and
shoulders
the
sudden
jarring
drop
on
the
arms
again
my
throat
was
intolerably
dry
under
other
circumstances
i
might
have
estimated
the
time
by
the
growth
of
hunger
and
thirst
but
the
rough
treatment
i
had
received
made
this
impossible
there
were
other
unmentionable
humiliating
pains
after
a
time
to
bolster
my
flagging
courage
i
found
myself
thinking
of
all
the
ways
it
might
have
been
worse
i
had
heard
of
a
exposed
to
the
bite
of
poisonous
not
fatal
but
painfully
poisonous
insects
and
to
the
worrying
of
the
small
gnawing
rodents
which
can
be
trained
to
bite
and
tear
or
i
might
have
been
branded
i
banished
the
memory
with
the
powerful
exorcism
the
man
in
daillon
whose
anticipation
alone
of
a
torture
which
never
came
had
broken
his
mind
there
was
only
one
way
to
conquer
this
and
that
was
to
act
as
if
the
present
moment
was
the
only
one
and
never
for
a
moment
to
forget
that
the
strongest
of
compacts
bound
them
not
to
harm
me
that
the
end
of
this
was
fixed
by
sunset
gradually
however
all
such
rational
thoughts
blurred
in
a
semidelirium
of
thirst
and
pain
narrowing
to
a
red
blaze
of
agony
across
my
shoulder
blades
i
eased
up
on
my
toes
again
pain
blazed
through
my
feet
the
rough
stone
on
which
my
toes
sank
had
been
covered
with
metal
and
i
smelled
scorching
flesh
jerking
up
my
feet
with
a
wordless
snarl
of
rage
and
fury
hanging
in
agony
by
my
shoulders
alone
and
then
i
lost
consciousness
at
least
for
several
moments
for
when
i
became
aware
again
through
the
nightmare
of
pain
my
toes
were
resting
lightly
and
securely
on
cold
stone
the
smell
of
burned
flesh
remained
and
the
painful
stinging
in
my
toes
mingled
with
that
smell
was
a
drift
of
perfume
close
by
dallisa
murmured
i
do
not
wish
to
break
our
bargain
by
damaging
your
feet
it
only
a
little
touch
of
fire
to
keep
you
from
too
much
security
in
resting
them
i
felt
the
taste
of
blood
mingle
in
my
mouth
with
the
sour
taste
of
vomit
i
felt
delirious
lightheaded
after
another
eternity
i
wondered
if
i
had
really
heard
dallisa
lilting
croon
or
whether
it
was
a
nightmare
born
of
feverish
pain
with
me
a
word
only
a
word
and
i
will
release
you
strong
man
scarred
man
perhaps
i
shall
demand
only
a
little
space
in
your
arms
would
not
such
doom
be
light
upon
you
perhaps
i
shall
set
you
free
to
seek
rakhal
if
only
to
plague
kyral
a
word
only
a
word
from
you
a
word
only
a
word
from
you
it
died
into
an
endlessly
echoing
whisper
swaying
blinded
i
wondered
why
i
endured
i
drew
a
dry
tongue
over
lips
salty
and
bloody
and
nightmarishly
considered
yielding
winning
my
way
somehow
around
dallisa
or
knocking
her
suddenly
senseless
and
escaping
i
who
need
not
be
bound
by
wolf
codes
either
i
fumbled
with
a
stiff
shape
of
words
and
a
breath
saved
me
a
soft
released
breath
of
anticipation
it
was
another
trick
i
swayed
limp
and
racked
i
was
not
race
cargill
now
i
was
a
dead
man
hanging
in
chains
swinging
filthy
vultures
pecking
at
my
dangling
feet
i
was
the
sound
of
boots
rang
on
the
stone
and
kyral
voice
low
and
bitter
demanded
somewhere
behind
me
what
have
you
done
with
him
she
did
not
answer
but
i
heard
her
chains
clash
lightly
and
imagined
her
gesture
kyral
muttered
women
have
no
genius
at
any
torture
except
his
voice
faded
out
into
great
distances
their
words
came
to
me
over
a
sort
of
windy
ringing
like
the
howling
of
lost
men
dying
in
the
snowfast
passes
of
the
mountains
speak
up
you
fool
he
ca
hear
you
now
if
you
have
let
him
faint
you
are
clumsy
talk
of
clumsiness
dallisa
voice
even
thinned
by
the
nightmare
ringing
in
my
head
held
concentrated
scorn
perhaps
i
shall
release
him
to
find
rakhal
when
you
failed
the
terrans
have
a
price
on
rakhal
head
too
and
at
least
this
man
will
not
confuse
himself
with
his
prey
if
you
think
i
would
let
you
bargain
with
a
dallisa
cried
passionately
you
trade
with
the
terrans
how
would
you
stop
me
then
i
trade
with
them
because
i
must
but
for
a
matter
involving
the
honor
of
the
great
house
the
great
house
whose
steps
you
would
never
have
climbed
except
for
rakhal
dallisa
sounded
as
if
she
were
chewing
her
words
in
little
pieces
and
spitting
them
at
kyral
oh
you
were
clever
to
take
us
both
as
your
consorts
you
did
not
know
it
was
rakhal
doing
did
you
hate
the
terrans
then
she
spat
an
obscenity
at
him
enjoy
your
hate
wallow
in
hating
and
in
the
end
all
shainsa
will
fall
prey
to
the
toymaker
like
miellyn
if
you
speak
that
name
again
said
kyral
very
low
i
will
kill
you
like
miellyn
miellyn
miellyn
dallisa
repeated
deliberately
you
fool
rakhal
knew
nothing
of
miellyn
he
was
seen
with
you
fool
with
you
can
not
yet
tell
twin
from
twin
rakhal
came
to
to
ask
news
of
her
kyral
cried
out
hoarsely
like
a
man
in
anguish
why
did
you
tell
me
you
do
really
have
to
ask
do
you
kyral
you
bitch
said
kyral
you
filthy
bitch
i
heard
the
sound
of
a
blow
the
next
moment
kyral
ripped
the
blindfold
from
my
eyes
and
i
blinked
in
the
blaze
of
light
my
arms
were
wholly
numb
now
twisted
above
my
head
but
the
jar
of
his
touch
sent
fresh
pain
racing
through
me
kyral
face
swam
out
of
the
blaze
of
hell
if
that
is
true
then
this
is
a
damnable
farce
dallisa
you
have
lost
our
chance
of
learning
what
he
knows
of
miellyn
what
knows
dallisa
lowered
her
hand
from
her
face
where
a
bruise
was
already
darkening
miellyn
has
twice
appeared
when
i
was
with
him
loose
him
dallisa
and
bargain
with
him
what
we
know
of
rakhal
for
what
he
knows
of
miellyn
if
you
think
i
would
let
you
bargain
with
she
mocked
weakling
this
quarrel
is
you
fool
the
others
in
the
caravan
will
give
me
news
if
you
will
not
is
cuinn
from
a
million
miles
away
kyral
laughed
you
slipped
the
wrong
hawk
dallisa
the
catmen
killed
him
his
skean
flicked
loose
he
climbed
to
a
perch
near
the
rope
at
my
wrists
bargain
with
me
rascar
i
coughed
unable
to
speak
and
kyral
insisted
will
you
bargain
end
this
damned
woman
farce
which
makes
a
mock
of
the
slant
of
sun
told
me
there
was
light
left
i
found
a
shred
of
voice
not
knowing
what
i
was
going
to
say
until
i
had
said
it
irrevocably
this
is
between
dallisa
and
me
kyral
glared
at
me
in
mounting
rage
with
four
strides
he
was
out
of
the
room
flinging
back
a
harsh
furious
i
hope
you
kill
each
other
and
the
door
slammed
dallisa
face
swam
red
and
again
as
before
i
knew
the
battle
which
was
joined
between
us
would
be
fought
to
a
dreadful
end
she
touched
my
chest
lightly
but
the
touch
jolted
excruciating
pain
through
my
shoulders
did
you
kill
cuinn
i
wondered
wearily
what
this
presaged
did
you
in
a
passion
she
cried
answer
did
you
kill
him
she
struck
me
hard
and
where
the
touch
had
been
pain
the
blow
was
a
blaze
of
white
agony
i
fainted
answer
she
struck
me
again
and
the
white
blaze
jolted
me
back
to
consciousness
answer
me
answer
each
cry
bought
a
blow
until
i
gasped
finally
he
signaled
set
catmen
on
us
no
she
stood
staring
at
me
and
her
white
face
was
a
death
mask
in
which
the
eyes
lived
she
screamed
wildly
and
the
huge
came
running
cut
him
down
cut
him
down
cut
him
down
a
knife
slashed
the
rope
and
i
slumped
falling
in
a
huddle
to
the
floor
my
arms
were
still
twisted
over
my
head
the
cut
the
ropes
apart
pulled
my
arms
roughly
back
into
place
and
i
gagged
with
the
pain
as
the
blood
began
flowing
painfully
through
the
chafed
and
swollen
hands
and
then
i
lost
consciousness
more
or
less
permanently
this
time
chapter
nine
when
i
came
to
again
i
was
lying
with
my
head
in
dallisa
lap
and
the
reddish
color
of
sunset
was
in
the
room
her
thighs
were
soft
under
my
head
and
for
an
instant
i
wondered
if
in
delirium
i
had
conceded
to
her
i
muttered
sun
not
down
she
bent
her
face
to
mine
whispering
hush
hush
it
was
heaven
and
i
drifted
off
again
after
a
moment
i
felt
a
cup
against
my
lips
can
you
swallow
this
i
could
and
did
i
could
taste
it
yet
but
it
was
cold
and
wet
and
felt
heavenly
trickling
down
my
throat
she
bent
and
looked
into
my
eyes
and
i
felt
as
if
i
were
falling
into
those
reddish
and
stormy
depths
she
touched
my
scarred
mouth
with
a
light
finger
suddenly
my
head
cleared
and
i
sat
upright
is
this
a
trick
to
force
me
into
calling
my
bet
she
recoiled
as
if
i
had
struck
her
then
the
trace
of
a
smile
flitted
around
her
red
mouth
yes
between
us
it
was
battle
you
are
right
to
be
suspicious
i
suppose
but
if
i
tell
you
what
i
know
of
rakhal
will
you
trust
me
then
i
looked
straight
at
her
and
said
no
surprisingly
she
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
i
flexed
my
freed
wrists
cautiously
the
skin
was
torn
away
and
chafed
and
my
arms
ached
to
the
bone
when
i
moved
harsh
lances
of
pain
drove
through
my
chest
well
until
sunset
i
have
no
right
to
ask
you
to
trust
me
said
dallisa
when
she
had
done
laughing
and
since
you
are
bound
by
my
command
until
the
last
ray
has
fallen
i
command
that
you
lay
your
head
upon
my
knees
i
blazed
you
are
making
a
game
of
me
is
that
my
privilege
do
you
refuse
refuse
it
was
not
yet
sunset
this
might
be
a
torture
more
complex
than
any
which
had
yet
greeted
me
from
the
scarlet
glint
in
her
eyes
i
felt
she
was
playing
with
me
as
the
of
the
forest
play
with
their
helpless
victims
my
mouth
twitched
in
a
grimace
of
humiliation
as
i
lowered
myself
obediently
until
my
head
rested
on
her
knees
she
murmured
smiling
is
this
so
unbearable
then
i
said
nothing
never
never
for
an
instant
could
i
forget
that
all
human
all
woman
as
she
seemed
dallisa
race
was
worn
and
old
when
the
terran
empire
had
not
left
their
home
star
the
mind
of
wolf
which
has
mingled
with
the
nonhuman
since
before
the
beginnings
of
recorded
time
is
unfathomable
to
an
outsider
i
was
better
equipped
than
most
earthmen
to
keep
pace
with
its
surface
acts
but
i
could
never
pretend
to
understand
its
deeper
motivations
it
works
on
complex
and
irrational
logic
mischief
is
an
integral
part
of
it
even
the
deadly
with
rakhal
had
begun
with
an
overelaborate
practical
joke
which
had
lost
the
service
incidentally
several
thousand
credits
worth
of
spaceship
and
so
i
could
not
trust
dallisa
for
an
instant
yet
it
was
wonderful
to
lie
here
with
my
head
resting
against
the
perfumed
softness
of
her
body
then
suddenly
her
arms
were
gripping
me
frantic
and
hungry
the
subdued
thing
in
her
voice
her
eyes
flamed
out
hot
and
wild
she
was
pressing
the
whole
length
of
her
body
to
mine
breasts
and
thighs
and
long
legs
and
her
voice
was
hoarse
is
this
torture
too
beneath
the
fur
robe
she
was
soft
and
white
and
the
subtle
scent
of
her
hair
seemed
a
deeper
entrapment
than
any
frail
as
she
seemed
her
arms
had
the
strength
of
steel
and
pain
blazed
down
my
wrenched
shoulders
seared
through
the
twisted
wrists
then
i
forgot
the
pain
over
her
shoulder
the
last
dropping
redness
of
the
sun
vanished
and
plunged
the
room
into
orchid
twilight
i
caught
her
wrists
in
my
hands
prizing
them
backward
twisting
them
upward
over
her
head
i
said
thickly
the
sun
down
and
then
i
stopped
her
wild
mouth
with
mine
and
i
knew
that
the
battle
between
us
had
reached
climax
and
victory
simultaneously
and
any
question
about
who
had
won
it
was
purely
academic
during
the
night
sometime
while
her
dark
head
lay
motionless
on
my
shoulder
i
found
myself
staring
into
the
darkness
wakeful
the
throbbing
of
my
bruises
had
little
to
do
with
my
sleeplessness
i
was
remembering
other
chained
girls
from
the
old
days
in
the
and
the
honey
and
poison
of
them
distilled
into
dallisa
kisses
her
head
was
very
light
on
my
shoulders
and
she
felt
curiously
insubstantial
like
a
woman
of
feathers
one
of
the
tiny
moons
was
visible
through
the
slitted
windows
i
thought
of
my
rooms
in
the
terran
trade
city
clean
and
bright
and
warm
and
all
the
nights
when
i
had
paced
the
floor
hating
filled
to
the
teeth
with
bitterness
longing
for
the
windswept
stars
of
the
the
salt
smell
of
the
winds
and
the
musical
clashing
of
the
walk
of
the
chained
women
with
a
sting
of
guilt
i
realized
that
i
had
half
forgotten
juli
and
my
pledge
to
her
and
her
misfortune
which
had
freed
me
again
for
this
yet
i
had
won
and
what
they
knew
had
narrowed
my
search
to
a
pinpoint
rakhal
was
in
charin
i
was
altogether
surprised
charin
is
the
only
city
on
wolf
except
the
kharsa
where
the
terran
empire
has
put
down
deep
roots
into
the
planet
built
a
trade
city
a
smaller
spaceport
like
the
kharsa
it
lies
within
the
circle
of
terran
law
and
a
million
miles
outside
it
a
nonhuman
town
inhabited
largely
by
it
is
the
core
and
center
of
the
resistance
movement
a
noisy
town
in
a
perpetual
ferment
it
was
the
logical
place
for
a
renegade
i
settled
myself
so
that
the
ache
in
my
racked
shoulders
was
less
violent
and
muttered
why
charin
slight
as
the
movement
was
it
roused
dallisa
she
rolled
over
and
propped
herself
on
her
elbows
quoting
drowsily
the
prey
walks
safest
at
the
hunter
door
i
stared
at
the
square
of
violet
moonlight
trying
to
fit
together
all
the
pieces
of
the
puzzle
and
asked
half
aloud
what
prey
and
what
hunters
dallisa
did
answer
i
had
expected
her
to
answer
i
asked
the
real
question
in
my
mind
why
does
kyral
hate
rakhal
sensar
when
he
even
know
him
by
sight
there
are
reasons
she
said
somberly
one
of
them
is
miellyn
my
twin
sister
kyral
climbed
the
steps
of
the
great
house
by
claiming
us
both
as
his
consorts
he
is
our
father
son
by
another
wife
that
explained
much
marriages
not
uncommon
in
the
are
based
on
expediency
and
suspicion
and
are
frequently
though
not
always
loveless
it
explained
dallisa
taunts
and
it
partly
explained
only
partly
why
i
found
her
in
my
arms
it
did
not
explain
rakhal
part
in
this
mysterious
intrigue
nor
why
kyral
had
taken
me
for
rakhal
but
only
after
he
remembered
seeing
me
in
terran
clothing
i
wondered
why
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
before
that
i
might
be
mistaken
for
rakhal
there
was
no
close
resemblance
between
us
but
a
casual
description
would
apply
equally
well
to
me
or
to
rakhal
my
height
is
unusual
for
a
terran
within
an
inch
of
rakhal
own
and
we
had
roughly
the
same
build
the
same
coloring
i
had
copied
his
walk
imitated
his
mannerisms
since
we
were
boys
together
and
blurring
minor
facial
characteristics
there
were
the
scars
of
the
on
my
mouth
cheeks
and
shoulders
anyone
who
did
not
know
us
by
sight
anyone
who
had
known
us
by
reputation
from
the
days
when
we
had
worked
together
in
the
might
easily
take
one
of
us
for
the
other
even
juli
had
blurted
you
so
much
like
before
thinking
better
of
it
other
odd
bits
of
the
puzzle
floated
in
my
mind
stubbornly
refusing
to
take
on
recognizable
patterns
the
disappearance
of
a
hysterical
babbling
the
way
the
girl
miellyn
had
vanished
into
a
shrine
of
nebran
and
the
taunts
of
dallisa
and
the
old
man
about
a
mysterious
toymaker
and
something
some
random
joggling
of
a
memory
in
that
eerie
trading
in
the
city
of
the
silent
ones
i
knew
all
these
things
fitted
together
somehow
but
i
had
no
real
hope
that
dallisa
could
complete
their
pattern
for
me
she
said
with
a
vehemence
that
startled
me
miellyn
is
only
the
excuse
kyral
hates
rakhal
because
rakhal
will
compromise
and
because
he
fight
she
rolled
over
and
pressed
herself
against
me
in
the
darkness
her
voice
trembled
race
our
world
is
dying
we
ca
stand
against
terra
and
there
are
other
things
worse
things
i
sat
up
surprised
to
find
myself
defending
terra
to
this
girl
after
all
these
years
i
was
back
in
my
own
world
and
yet
i
heard
myself
say
quietly
the
terrans
are
exploiting
wolf
we
have
abolished
the
rule
of
shainsa
we
changed
nothing
it
was
true
terra
held
wolf
by
compact
not
conquest
they
paid
and
paid
generously
for
the
lease
of
the
lands
where
their
trade
cities
would
rise
and
stepped
beyond
them
only
when
invited
to
do
so
we
let
any
city
or
state
that
wants
to
keep
its
independence
govern
itself
until
it
collapses
dallisa
and
they
do
collapse
after
a
generation
or
so
very
few
primitive
planets
can
hold
out
against
us
the
people
themselves
get
tired
of
living
under
feudal
or
theocratic
systems
and
they
beg
to
be
taken
into
the
empire
that
all
but
that
just
it
dallisa
argued
you
give
the
people
all
those
things
we
used
to
give
them
and
you
do
it
better
just
by
being
here
you
are
killing
the
they
turning
to
you
and
leaving
us
and
you
let
them
do
it
i
shook
my
head
we
kept
the
terran
peace
for
centuries
what
do
you
expect
should
we
give
you
arms
planes
bombs
weapons
to
hold
your
slaves
down
yes
she
flared
at
me
the
have
ruled
wolf
since
since
you
you
ca
even
imagine
how
long
and
we
made
compact
with
you
to
trade
here
and
we
have
rewarded
you
by
leaving
you
untouched
i
said
quietly
but
we
have
not
forbidden
the
to
come
into
the
empire
and
work
with
terra
she
said
bitterly
men
like
kyral
will
die
first
and
pressed
her
face
helplessly
against
me
and
i
will
die
with
them
miellyn
broke
away
but
i
can
not
courage
is
what
i
lack
our
world
is
rotten
race
rotten
all
through
and
i
as
rotten
as
the
core
of
it
i
could
have
killed
you
today
and
i
here
in
your
arms
our
world
is
rotten
but
i
no
confidence
that
the
new
world
will
be
better
i
put
my
hand
under
her
chin
and
looked
down
gravely
into
her
face
only
a
pale
oval
in
the
darkness
there
was
nothing
i
could
say
she
had
said
it
all
and
truthfully
i
had
hated
and
yearned
and
starved
for
this
and
when
i
found
it
it
turned
salty
and
bloody
on
my
lips
like
dallisa
despairing
kisses
she
ran
her
fingers
over
the
scars
on
my
face
then
gripped
her
small
thin
hands
around
my
wrists
so
fiercely
that
i
grunted
protest
you
will
not
forget
me
she
said
in
her
strangely
lilting
voice
you
will
not
forget
me
although
you
were
victorious
she
twisted
and
lay
looking
up
at
me
her
eyes
glowing
faintly
luminous
in
darkness
i
knew
that
she
could
see
me
as
clearly
as
if
it
were
day
i
think
it
was
my
victory
not
yours
race
cargill
gently
on
an
impulse
i
could
not
explain
i
picked
up
one
delicate
wrist
then
the
other
unclasping
the
heavy
jeweled
bracelets
she
let
out
a
stifled
cry
of
dismay
and
then
i
tossed
the
chains
into
a
corner
before
i
drew
her
savagely
into
my
arms
again
and
forced
her
head
back
under
my
mouth
i
said
to
her
alone
in
the
reddish
windswept
space
before
the
great
house
she
pressed
her
head
against
my
shoulder
and
whispered
race
take
me
with
you
for
answer
i
only
picked
up
her
narrow
wrists
and
turned
them
over
on
my
palm
the
jeweled
bracelets
were
clasped
again
around
the
thinly
boned
joints
and
on
some
impulse
she
had
shortened
the
chains
so
that
she
could
not
even
put
her
arms
around
me
i
lifted
the
punished
wrists
to
my
mouth
and
kissed
them
gently
you
do
want
to
leave
dallisa
i
was
desperately
sorry
for
her
she
would
go
down
with
her
dying
world
proud
and
cold
and
with
no
place
in
the
new
one
she
kissed
me
and
i
tasted
blood
her
thin
fettered
body
straining
wildly
against
me
shaken
with
tearing
convulsive
sobs
then
she
turned
and
fled
back
into
the
shadow
of
the
great
dark
house
i
never
saw
her
again
chapter
ten
a
few
days
later
i
found
myself
nearing
the
end
of
the
trail
it
was
twilight
in
charin
hot
and
reeking
with
the
gypsy
glare
of
fires
which
burned
smoking
at
the
far
end
of
the
street
of
the
six
shepherds
i
crouched
in
the
shadow
of
a
wall
waiting
my
skin
itched
from
the
dirty
shirtcloak
i
had
changed
in
days
shabbiness
is
wise
in
nonhuman
parts
and
think
too
much
of
water
to
waste
much
of
it
in
superfluous
washing
anyhow
i
scratched
unobtrusively
and
glanced
cautiously
down
the
street
it
seemed
empty
except
for
a
few
sodden
derelicts
sprawled
in
doorways
the
street
of
the
six
shepherds
is
a
filthy
slum
but
i
made
sure
my
skean
was
loose
charin
is
not
a
particularly
safe
town
even
for
and
especially
not
for
earthmen
at
any
time
even
with
what
dallisa
had
told
me
the
search
had
been
difficult
charin
is
not
shainsa
in
charin
where
human
and
nonhuman
live
closer
together
than
anywhere
else
on
the
planet
information
about
such
men
as
rakhal
can
be
bought
but
the
policy
is
to
let
the
buyer
beware
fair
enough
because
the
life
of
the
seller
has
a
way
of
not
being
worth
much
afterward
either
a
dirty
wind
was
blowing
up
along
the
street
heavy
with
strange
smells
the
pungent
reek
of
incense
from
a
was
in
the
smells
the
heavy
acrid
odor
that
made
my
skin
crawl
in
the
hills
behind
charin
the
ghost
wind
was
rising
borne
on
this
wind
the
would
sweep
down
from
the
mountains
and
everything
human
or
nearly
human
would
scatter
in
their
path
they
would
range
through
the
quarter
all
night
and
in
the
morning
they
would
melt
away
until
the
ghost
wind
blew
again
at
any
other
time
i
would
already
have
taken
cover
i
fancied
that
i
could
hear
borne
on
the
wind
the
faraway
yelping
and
envision
the
plumed
taloned
figures
which
would
come
leaping
down
the
street
in
that
moment
the
quiet
of
the
street
split
asunder
from
somewhere
a
girl
voice
screamed
in
shrill
pain
or
panic
then
i
saw
her
dodging
between
two
of
the
chinked
she
was
a
child
thin
and
barefoot
a
long
tangle
of
black
hair
flying
loose
as
she
darted
and
twisted
to
elude
the
lumbering
fellow
at
her
heels
his
outstretched
paw
jerked
cruelly
at
her
slim
wrist
the
little
girl
screamed
and
wrenched
herself
free
and
threw
herself
straight
on
me
wrapping
herself
around
my
neck
with
the
violence
of
a
storm
wind
her
hair
got
in
my
mouth
and
her
small
hands
gripped
at
my
back
like
a
cat
flexed
claws
oh
help
me
she
gasped
between
sobs
do
let
him
get
me
do
and
even
in
that
broken
plea
i
took
it
in
that
the
little
ragamuffin
did
not
speak
the
jargon
of
that
slum
but
the
pure
speech
of
shainsa
what
i
did
then
was
as
automatic
as
if
it
had
been
juli
i
pulled
the
kid
loose
shoved
her
behind
me
and
scowled
at
the
brute
who
lurched
toward
us
make
yourself
scarce
i
advised
we
do
chase
little
girls
where
i
come
from
haul
off
now
the
man
reeled
i
smelled
the
rankness
of
his
rags
as
he
thrust
one
grimy
paw
at
the
girl
i
never
was
the
hero
type
but
i
started
something
which
i
had
to
carry
through
i
thrust
myself
between
them
and
put
my
hand
on
the
skean
again
you
you
the
man
set
up
a
tipsy
howl
and
i
sucked
in
my
breath
now
i
was
in
for
it
unless
i
got
out
of
there
damned
fast
lose
what
i
come
all
the
way
to
charin
to
find
i
felt
like
handing
the
girl
over
for
all
i
knew
the
bully
could
be
her
father
and
she
was
properly
in
line
for
a
spanking
this
was
any
of
my
business
my
business
lay
at
the
end
of
the
street
where
rakhal
was
waiting
at
the
fires
he
would
be
there
long
already
the
smell
of
the
ghost
wind
was
heavy
and
harsh
and
little
flurries
of
sand
went
racing
along
the
street
lifting
the
flaps
of
the
doorways
but
i
did
nothing
so
sensible
the
big
lunk
made
a
grab
at
the
girl
and
i
whipped
out
my
skean
and
pantomimed
get
going
he
spat
out
the
word
like
filth
his
narrowing
to
slits
son
of
the
ape
someone
took
up
the
howl
there
was
a
stir
a
rustle
all
along
the
street
that
had
seemed
empty
and
from
nowhere
it
seemed
the
space
in
front
of
me
was
crowded
with
shadowy
forms
human
and
otherwise
earthman
i
felt
the
muscles
across
my
belly
knotting
into
a
band
of
ice
i
believe
i
given
myself
away
as
an
earthman
the
bully
was
using
the
tactic
of
stirring
up
a
riot
in
a
hurry
but
just
the
same
i
looked
quickly
round
hunting
a
path
of
escape
put
your
skean
in
his
guts
spilkar
grab
him
earthman
it
was
the
last
cry
that
made
me
panic
through
the
sultry
glare
at
the
end
of
the
street
i
could
see
the
plumed
taloned
figures
of
the
gliding
through
the
banners
of
smoke
the
crowd
melted
open
i
did
stop
to
reflect
on
the
fact
suddenly
very
obvious
that
rakhal
could
have
been
at
the
fires
at
all
and
that
my
informant
had
led
me
into
an
open
trap
a
nest
of
already
inside
charin
the
crowd
edged
back
and
muttered
and
suddenly
i
made
my
choice
i
whirled
snatched
up
the
girl
in
my
arms
and
ran
straight
toward
the
advancing
figures
of
the
nobody
followed
me
i
even
heard
a
choked
shout
that
sounded
like
a
warning
i
heard
the
yelping
shrieks
of
the
grow
to
a
wild
howl
and
at
the
last
minute
when
their
stiff
rustling
plumes
loomed
only
a
few
yards
away
i
dived
sidewise
into
an
alley
stumbled
on
some
rubbish
and
spilled
the
girl
down
run
kid
she
shook
herself
like
a
puppy
climbing
out
of
water
her
small
fingers
closed
like
a
steel
trap
on
my
wrist
this
way
she
urged
in
a
hasty
whisper
and
i
found
myself
plunging
out
the
far
end
of
the
alley
and
into
the
shelter
of
a
the
sour
stink
of
incense
smarted
in
my
nostrils
and
i
could
hear
the
yelping
of
the
as
they
leaped
and
rustled
down
the
alley
their
cold
and
poisonous
eyes
searching
out
the
recess
where
i
crouched
with
the
girl
here
she
panted
stand
close
to
me
on
the
stone
i
drew
back
startled
oh
do
stop
to
argue
she
whimpered
come
earthman
there
he
is
the
girl
arms
flung
round
me
again
i
felt
her
slight
hard
body
pressing
on
mine
and
she
literally
hauled
me
toward
the
pattern
of
stones
at
the
center
of
the
shrine
i
would
have
been
human
if
i
had
caught
her
closer
yet
the
world
reeled
the
street
disappeared
in
a
cone
of
spinning
lights
stars
danced
crazily
and
i
plunged
down
through
a
widening
gulf
of
empty
space
locked
in
the
girl
arms
i
fell
spun
plunged
head
over
heels
through
tilting
lights
and
shadows
that
flung
us
through
eternities
of
freefall
the
yelping
of
the
whirled
away
in
unimaginable
distances
and
for
a
second
i
felt
the
unmerciful
blackout
of
a
power
dive
with
blood
breaking
from
my
nostrils
and
filling
my
mouth
chapter
eleven
lights
flared
in
my
eyes
i
was
standing
solidly
on
my
feet
in
the
but
the
street
was
gone
coils
of
incense
still
smudged
the
air
the
god
squatted
toadlike
in
his
recess
the
girl
was
hanging
limp
locked
in
my
clenched
arms
as
the
floor
straightened
under
my
feet
i
staggered
thrown
off
balance
by
the
sudden
return
of
the
girl
weight
and
grabbed
blindly
for
support
give
her
to
me
said
a
voice
and
the
girl
sagging
body
was
lifted
from
my
arms
a
strong
hand
grasped
my
elbow
i
found
a
chair
beneath
my
knees
and
sank
gratefully
into
it
the
transmission
is
smooth
yet
between
such
distant
terminals
the
voice
remarked
i
see
miellyn
has
fainted
again
a
weakling
the
girl
but
useful
i
spat
blood
trying
to
get
the
room
in
focus
for
i
was
inside
a
room
a
room
of
some
translucent
substance
windowless
a
skylight
high
above
me
through
which
pink
daylight
streamed
daylight
and
it
had
been
midnight
in
charin
i
come
halfway
around
the
planet
in
a
few
seconds
from
somewhere
i
heard
the
sound
of
hammering
tiny
hammering
the
chiming
of
a
fairy
anvil
i
looked
up
and
saw
a
man
a
man
watching
me
on
wolf
you
see
all
kinds
of
human
and
nonhuman
life
and
i
consider
myself
something
of
an
expert
on
all
three
but
i
had
never
seen
anyone
or
anything
who
so
closely
resembled
the
human
and
so
obviously
was
he
or
it
was
tall
and
lean
but
oddly
muscled
a
vague
suggestion
of
something
less
than
human
in
the
lean
hunch
of
his
posture
manlike
he
wore
green
trunks
and
a
shirt
of
green
fur
that
revealed
bulging
biceps
where
they
should
be
and
angular
planes
where
there
should
have
been
swelling
muscles
the
shoulders
were
high
the
neck
unpleasantly
sinuous
and
the
face
a
little
narrower
than
human
was
handsomely
arrogant
with
a
kind
of
wary
alert
mischief
that
was
the
least
human
thing
about
him
he
bent
tilted
the
girl
inert
body
on
to
a
divan
of
some
sort
and
turned
his
back
on
her
lifting
his
hand
in
an
impatient
and
unpleasantly
reminiscent
gesture
the
tinkling
of
the
little
hammers
stopped
as
if
a
switch
had
been
disconnected
now
said
the
nonhuman
we
can
talk
like
the
waif
he
spoke
shainsan
and
spoke
it
with
a
better
accent
than
any
nonhuman
i
had
ever
known
so
well
that
i
looked
again
to
be
certain
i
was
too
dazed
to
answer
in
the
same
tongue
but
i
keep
back
a
spate
of
questions
what
happened
who
are
you
what
is
this
place
the
nonhuman
waited
crossing
his
hands
quite
passable
hands
if
you
did
look
too
closely
at
what
should
have
been
nails
and
bent
forward
in
a
sketchy
gesture
do
not
blame
miellyn
she
acted
under
orders
it
was
imperative
you
be
brought
here
tonight
and
we
had
reason
to
believe
you
might
ignore
an
ordinary
summons
you
were
clever
at
evading
our
surveillance
for
a
time
but
there
would
not
be
two
in
charin
tonight
who
would
dare
the
ghost
wind
your
reputation
does
you
justice
rakhal
sensar
sensar
once
again
rakhal
shaken
i
pulled
a
rag
from
my
pocket
and
wiped
blood
from
my
mouth
figured
out
in
shainsa
why
the
mistake
was
logical
and
here
in
charin
i
been
hanging
around
in
rakhal
old
haunts
covering
his
old
trails
once
again
mistaken
identity
was
natural
natural
or
not
i
was
going
to
deny
it
if
these
were
enemies
my
real
identity
should
be
kept
as
an
ace
in
reserve
which
might
just
might
get
me
out
alive
again
if
they
were
his
friends
well
i
could
only
hope
that
no
one
who
knew
him
well
by
sight
would
walk
in
on
me
we
knew
the
nonhuman
continued
that
if
you
remained
where
you
were
the
cargill
would
have
made
his
arrest
we
know
about
your
quarrel
with
cargill
among
other
things
but
we
did
not
consider
it
necessary
that
you
should
fall
into
his
hands
at
present
i
was
puzzled
i
still
do
understand
exactly
where
am
i
this
is
the
mastershrine
of
nebran
the
stray
pieces
of
the
puzzle
suddenly
jolted
into
place
kyral
had
warned
me
not
knowing
he
was
doing
it
i
hastily
imitated
the
gesture
kyral
had
made
gabbling
a
few
words
of
an
archaic
charm
like
every
earthman
who
lived
on
wolf
more
than
a
tourist
season
seen
faces
go
blank
and
impassive
at
mention
of
the
toad
god
rumor
made
his
spies
omnipresent
his
priests
omniscient
his
anger
i
had
believed
about
a
tenth
of
what
i
had
heard
or
less
the
terran
empire
has
little
to
say
to
planetary
religions
and
cult
is
a
remarkably
obscure
one
despite
the
on
every
corner
now
i
was
in
his
mastershrine
and
the
device
which
had
brought
me
here
was
beyond
doubt
a
working
model
of
a
matter
transmitter
a
matter
transmitter
a
working
model
the
words
triggered
memory
rakhal
was
after
it
and
who
i
asked
slowly
are
you
lord
the
creature
hunched
thin
shoulders
again
in
a
ceremonious
gesture
i
am
called
evarin
humble
servant
of
nebran
and
yourself
he
added
but
there
was
no
humility
in
his
manner
i
am
called
the
toymaker
that
was
another
name
given
weight
by
rumor
a
breath
of
gossip
in
a
thieves
market
a
scrawled
word
on
smudged
paper
a
blank
folder
in
terran
intelligence
another
snapped
into
place
the
girl
on
the
divan
sat
up
suddenly
passing
slim
hands
over
her
disheveled
hair
did
i
faint
evarin
i
had
to
fight
to
get
him
into
the
stone
and
the
patterns
were
not
set
straight
in
that
terminal
you
must
send
one
of
the
little
ones
to
set
them
to
rights
toymaker
you
are
not
listening
to
me
stop
chattering
miellyn
said
evarin
indifferently
you
brought
him
here
and
that
is
all
that
matters
you
are
hurt
miellyn
pouted
and
looked
ruefully
at
her
bare
bruised
feet
patted
the
wrinkles
in
her
ragged
frock
with
fastidious
fingers
my
poor
feet
she
mourned
they
are
black
and
blue
with
the
cobbles
and
my
hair
is
filled
with
sand
and
tangles
toymaker
what
way
was
this
to
send
me
to
entice
a
man
any
man
would
have
come
quickly
quickly
if
he
had
seen
me
looking
lovely
but
you
you
send
me
in
rags
she
stamped
a
small
bare
foot
she
was
not
merely
as
young
as
she
had
looked
in
the
street
though
immature
and
underdeveloped
by
terran
standards
she
had
a
fair
figure
for
a
woman
her
rags
fell
now
in
graceful
folds
her
hair
was
spun
black
glass
and
i
i
saw
what
the
rags
and
the
confusion
in
the
filthy
street
had
kept
me
from
seeing
before
it
was
the
girl
of
the
spaceport
cafe
the
girl
who
had
appeared
and
vanished
in
the
eerie
streets
of
canarsa
evarin
was
regarding
her
with
what
in
a
human
might
have
been
rueful
impatience
he
said
you
know
you
enjoyed
yourself
as
always
miellyn
run
along
and
make
yourself
beautiful
again
little
nuisance
the
girl
danced
out
of
the
room
and
i
was
just
as
glad
to
see
her
go
the
toymaker
motioned
to
me
this
way
he
directed
and
led
me
through
a
different
door
the
offstage
hammering
i
had
heard
tiny
bell
tones
like
a
fairy
xylophone
began
again
as
the
door
opened
and
we
passed
into
a
workroom
which
made
me
remember
nursery
tales
from
a
childhood
on
terra
for
the
workers
were
tiny
gnarled
they
were
from
the
polar
mountains
dwarfed
and
furred
and
with
witchlike
faces
and
great
golden
eyes
and
i
had
the
curious
feeling
that
if
i
looked
hard
enough
i
would
see
the
little
they
had
hunted
out
of
the
kharsa
i
did
look
i
figured
i
was
in
enough
trouble
already
tiny
hammers
pattered
on
miniature
anvils
in
a
tinkling
jingling
chorus
of
musical
clinks
and
taps
golden
eyes
focused
like
lenses
over
winking
jewels
and
gimcracks
busy
elves
makers
of
toys
evarin
jerked
his
shoulders
with
an
imperative
gesture
i
followed
him
through
a
fairy
workroom
but
could
not
refrain
from
casting
a
lingering
look
at
the
worktables
a
withered
leprechaun
set
eyes
into
the
head
of
a
minikin
hound
furred
fingers
worked
precious
metals
into
invisible
filigree
for
the
collarpiece
of
a
dancing
doll
metallic
feathers
were
thrust
with
clockwork
precision
into
the
wings
of
a
skeleton
bird
no
longer
than
my
fingernail
the
nose
of
the
hound
wabbled
and
sniffed
the
bird
wings
quivered
the
eyes
of
the
little
dancer
followed
my
footsteps
toys
this
way
evarin
rapped
and
a
door
slid
shut
behind
us
the
clinks
and
taps
grew
faint
fainter
but
never
ceased
my
face
must
have
betrayed
more
than
conventional
impassivity
for
evarin
smiled
now
you
know
rakhal
why
i
am
called
toymaker
is
it
not
strange
the
masterpriest
of
nebran
a
maker
of
toys
and
the
shrine
of
the
toad
god
a
workshop
for
children
playthings
evarin
paused
suggestively
they
were
obviously
not
playthings
and
this
was
my
cue
to
say
so
but
i
avoided
the
trap
evarin
opened
a
sliding
panel
and
took
out
a
doll
she
was
perhaps
the
length
of
my
longest
finger
molded
to
the
precise
proportions
of
a
woman
and
costumed
after
the
bizarre
fashion
of
the
ardcarran
dancing
girls
evarin
touched
no
button
or
key
that
i
could
see
but
when
he
set
the
figure
on
its
feet
it
executed
a
whirling
armtossing
dance
in
a
fast
tricky
tempo
i
am
in
a
sense
benevolent
evarin
murmured
he
snapped
his
fingers
and
the
doll
sank
to
her
knees
and
poised
there
silent
moreover
i
have
the
means
and
let
us
say
the
ability
to
indulge
my
small
fantasies
the
little
daughter
of
the
president
of
the
federation
of
trade
cities
on
samarra
was
sent
such
a
doll
recently
what
a
pity
that
paolo
arimengo
was
so
suddenly
impeached
and
banished
the
toymaker
clucked
his
teeth
commiseratingly
perhaps
this
small
companion
will
compensate
the
little
carmela
for
her
adjustment
to
her
new
position
he
replaced
the
dancer
and
pulled
down
something
like
a
whirligig
this
might
interest
you
he
mused
and
set
it
spinning
i
stared
at
the
pattern
of
lights
that
flowed
and
disappeared
melting
in
and
out
of
visible
shadows
suddenly
i
realized
what
the
thing
was
doing
i
wrested
my
eyes
away
with
an
effort
had
there
been
a
lapse
of
seconds
or
minutes
had
evarin
spoken
evarin
arrested
the
compelling
motion
with
one
finger
several
of
these
pretty
playthings
are
available
to
the
children
of
important
men
he
said
absently
an
import
of
value
for
our
exploited
and
impoverished
world
unfortunately
they
are
perhaps
a
little
ah
obvious
the
incidence
of
nervous
breakdowns
is
ah
interfering
with
their
sale
the
children
of
course
are
unaffected
and
love
them
evarin
set
the
hypnotic
wheel
moving
again
glanced
sidewise
at
me
then
set
it
carefully
back
now
evarin
voice
hard
with
the
silkiness
of
a
cat
snarl
clawed
the
silence
we
talk
business
i
turned
composing
my
face
evarin
had
something
concealed
in
one
hand
but
i
did
think
it
was
a
weapon
and
if
i
known
i
have
had
to
ignore
it
anyway
perhaps
you
wonder
how
we
recognized
and
found
you
a
panel
cleared
in
the
wall
and
became
translucent
confused
flickers
moved
dropped
into
focus
and
i
realized
that
the
panel
was
an
ordinary
television
screen
and
i
was
looking
into
the
interior
of
the
cafe
of
three
rainbows
in
the
trade
city
of
charin
by
this
time
i
was
running
low
on
curiosity
and
did
wonder
till
much
much
later
how
televised
pictures
were
transmitted
around
the
curve
of
a
planet
evarin
sharpened
the
focus
down
on
the
long
bar
where
a
tall
man
in
terran
clothes
was
talking
to
a
girl
evarin
said
by
now
race
cargill
has
decided
no
doubt
that
you
fell
into
his
trap
and
into
the
hands
of
the
he
is
now
and
suddenly
the
whole
thing
seemed
so
unbearably
illogically
funny
that
my
shoulders
shook
with
the
effort
to
keep
back
dangerous
laughter
since
i
landed
in
charin
i
taken
great
pains
to
avoid
the
trade
city
or
anyone
who
might
have
associated
me
with
it
and
rakhal
somehow
aware
of
this
had
conveniently
filled
up
the
gap
by
posing
as
me
it
was
nearly
as
difficult
as
it
sounded
i
had
found
that
out
in
shainsa
charin
is
a
long
long
way
from
the
major
trade
city
near
the
kharsa
i
had
a
single
intimate
friend
there
or
within
hundreds
of
miles
to
see
through
the
imposture
at
most
there
were
half
a
dozen
of
the
staff
that
i
once
met
or
had
a
drink
with
eight
or
ten
years
ago
rakhal
could
speak
perfect
standard
when
he
chose
if
he
lapsed
into
idiom
that
too
was
in
my
known
character
i
had
no
doubt
he
was
making
a
great
success
of
it
all
probably
doing
much
better
with
my
identity
than
i
could
ever
have
done
with
his
evarin
rasped
cargill
meant
to
leave
the
planet
what
stopped
him
you
could
be
of
use
to
us
rakhal
but
not
with
this
unsettled
that
needed
no
elucidation
no
wolfan
in
his
right
mind
will
bargain
with
a
carrying
an
unresolved
by
law
and
custom
declared
takes
precedence
over
any
other
business
public
or
private
and
is
sufficient
excuse
for
broken
promises
neglected
duties
theft
even
murder
we
want
it
settled
once
and
for
all
evarin
voice
was
low
and
unhurried
and
we
are
above
weighting
the
scales
this
cargill
can
and
has
posed
as
a
undetected
we
do
like
earthmen
who
can
do
that
in
settling
your
feud
you
will
be
aiding
us
and
removing
a
danger
we
would
be
grateful
he
opened
his
closed
hand
displaying
something
small
curled
inert
every
living
thing
emits
a
characteristic
pattern
of
electrical
nerve
impulses
we
have
ways
of
recording
those
impulses
and
we
have
had
you
and
cargill
under
observation
for
a
long
time
we
had
plenty
of
opportunity
to
key
this
toy
to
cargill
pattern
on
his
palm
the
curled
thing
stirred
spread
wings
a
fledgling
bird
lay
there
small
soft
body
throbbing
slightly
in
a
ruff
of
metallic
feathers
i
glimpsed
a
grimly
elongated
beak
the
pinions
were
feathered
with
delicate
down
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
inch
long
they
beat
with
delicate
insistence
against
the
toymaker
prisoning
fingers
this
is
not
dangerous
to
you
press
here
he
showed
me
and
if
race
cargill
is
within
a
certain
distance
and
it
is
up
to
you
to
be
that
distance
it
will
find
him
and
kill
him
unerringly
inescapably
untraceably
we
will
not
tell
you
the
critical
distance
and
we
will
give
you
three
days
he
checked
my
startled
exclamation
with
a
gesture
of
course
this
is
a
test
within
the
hour
cargill
will
receive
a
warning
we
want
no
incompetents
who
must
be
helped
too
much
nor
do
we
want
cowards
if
you
fail
or
release
the
bird
at
a
distance
too
great
or
evade
the
test
the
green
inhuman
malice
in
his
eyes
made
me
sweat
we
have
made
another
bird
by
now
my
brain
was
swimming
but
i
thought
i
understood
the
complex
inhuman
logic
involved
the
other
bird
is
keyed
to
me
with
slow
contempt
evarin
shook
his
head
you
you
are
used
to
danger
and
fond
of
a
gamble
nothing
so
simple
we
have
given
you
three
days
if
within
that
time
the
bird
you
carry
has
not
killed
the
other
bird
will
fly
and
it
will
kill
rakhal
you
have
a
wife
yes
rakhal
had
a
wife
they
could
threaten
rakhal
wife
and
his
wife
was
my
sister
juli
everything
after
that
was
anticlimax
of
course
i
had
to
drink
with
evarin
the
elaborate
formal
ritual
without
which
no
bargain
on
wolf
is
concluded
he
entertained
me
with
gory
and
technical
descriptions
of
the
way
in
which
the
birds
and
other
of
his
hellish
toys
did
their
killing
and
worse
tasks
miellyn
danced
into
the
room
and
upset
the
exquisite
solemnity
of
the
by
perching
on
my
knee
stealing
a
sip
from
my
cup
and
pouting
prettily
when
i
paid
her
less
attention
than
she
thought
she
merited
i
did
dare
pay
much
attention
even
when
she
whispered
with
the
deliberate
and
thorough
wantonness
of
a
woman
of
who
has
flung
aside
her
fetters
something
about
a
rendezvous
at
the
three
rainbows
but
eventually
it
was
over
and
i
stepped
through
a
door
that
twisted
with
a
giddy
blankness
and
found
myself
outside
a
bare
windowless
wall
in
charin
again
the
night
sky
starred
and
cold
the
acrid
smell
of
the
ghost
wind
was
thinning
in
the
streets
but
i
had
to
crouch
in
a
cranny
of
the
wall
when
a
final
rustling
horde
of
the
last
of
their
receding
tide
rustled
down
the
street
i
found
my
way
to
my
lodging
in
a
filthy
hostel
and
threw
myself
down
on
the
verminous
bed
believe
it
or
not
i
slept
chapter
twelve
an
hour
before
dawn
there
was
a
noise
in
my
room
i
roused
my
hand
on
my
skean
someone
or
something
was
fumbling
under
the
mattress
where
i
had
thrust
evarin
bird
i
struck
out
encountered
something
warm
and
breathing
and
grappled
with
it
in
the
darkness
a
something
gripped
over
my
mouth
i
tore
it
away
and
struck
hard
with
the
skean
there
was
a
high
shrilling
the
gripping
filth
loosened
and
fell
away
and
something
died
on
the
floor
i
struck
a
light
retching
in
revulsion
it
had
been
human
there
would
have
been
that
much
blood
from
a
human
not
that
color
either
the
who
ran
the
place
came
and
gibbered
at
me
have
a
horror
of
blood
and
this
one
gave
me
to
understand
that
my
lease
was
up
then
and
there
no
arguments
no
refunds
he
would
even
let
me
go
into
his
stone
outbuilding
to
wash
the
foul
stuff
from
my
shirtcloak
i
gave
up
and
fished
under
the
mattress
for
evarin
toy
the
got
a
glimpse
of
the
embroideries
on
the
silk
in
which
it
was
wrapped
and
stood
back
his
loose
furry
lips
hanging
open
while
i
gathered
my
few
belongings
together
and
strode
out
of
the
room
he
would
not
touch
the
coins
i
offered
i
laid
them
on
a
chest
and
he
let
them
lie
there
and
as
i
went
into
the
reddening
morning
they
came
flying
after
me
into
the
street
i
pulled
the
silk
from
the
toy
and
tried
to
make
some
sense
from
my
predicament
the
little
thing
lay
innocent
and
silent
in
my
palm
it
would
tell
me
whether
it
had
been
keyed
to
me
the
real
cargill
some
time
in
the
past
or
to
rakhal
using
my
name
and
reputation
in
the
terran
colony
here
at
charin
if
i
pressed
the
stud
it
might
play
out
this
comedy
of
errors
by
hunting
down
rakhal
and
all
my
troubles
would
be
over
for
a
while
at
least
until
evarin
found
out
what
had
happened
i
did
deceive
myself
that
i
could
carry
the
impersonation
through
another
meeting
on
the
other
hand
if
i
pressed
the
stud
the
bird
might
turn
on
me
and
then
all
my
troubles
would
be
over
for
good
if
i
delayed
past
evarin
deadline
and
did
nothing
the
other
bird
in
his
keeping
would
hunt
down
juli
and
give
her
a
swift
and
not
too
painless
death
i
spent
most
of
the
day
in
a
dive
juggling
plans
toys
innocent
and
sinister
spies
messengers
toys
which
killed
horribly
toys
which
could
be
controlled
perhaps
by
the
pliant
mind
of
a
child
and
every
child
hates
its
parents
now
and
again
even
in
the
terran
colony
who
was
safe
in
mack
very
home
one
of
the
magnusson
youngsters
had
a
shiny
thing
which
might
or
might
not
be
one
of
evarin
hellish
toys
or
was
i
beginning
to
think
like
a
superstitious
damn
it
evarin
could
be
infallible
he
had
even
recognized
me
as
race
cargill
or
suddenly
the
sweat
broke
out
again
on
my
forehead
had
had
the
whole
thing
been
one
of
those
sinister
deadly
and
incomprehensible
nonhuman
jokes
i
kept
coming
to
the
same
conclusion
juli
was
in
danger
but
she
was
half
a
world
away
rakhal
was
here
in
charin
there
was
a
child
involved
juli
child
the
first
step
was
to
get
inside
the
terran
colony
and
see
how
the
land
lay
charin
is
a
city
shaped
like
a
crescent
moon
encircling
the
small
trade
city
a
miniature
spaceport
a
miniature
skyscraper
hq
the
clustered
dwellings
of
the
terrans
who
worked
there
and
those
who
lived
with
them
and
supplied
them
with
necessities
services
and
luxuries
entry
from
one
to
the
other
is
through
a
guarded
gateway
since
this
is
hostile
territory
and
charin
lies
far
beyond
the
impress
of
ordinary
terran
law
but
the
gate
stood
and
the
guards
looked
lax
and
bored
they
had
shockers
but
they
did
look
as
if
they
used
them
lately
one
raised
an
eyebrow
at
his
companion
as
i
shambled
up
i
could
pretty
well
guess
the
impression
i
made
dirty
unkempt
and
stained
with
nonhuman
blood
i
asked
permission
to
go
into
the
terran
zone
they
asked
my
name
and
business
and
i
toyed
with
the
notion
of
giving
the
name
of
the
man
i
was
inadvertently
impersonating
then
i
decided
that
if
rakhal
had
passed
himself
off
as
race
cargill
he
expect
exactly
that
and
he
was
also
capable
of
the
masterstroke
of
impudence
putting
out
a
pickup
order
through
spaceforce
for
his
own
name
so
i
gave
the
name
we
used
from
shainsa
to
charin
and
tacked
one
of
the
secret
service
passwords
on
the
end
of
it
they
looked
at
each
other
again
and
one
said
rascar
eh
this
is
the
guy
all
right
he
took
me
into
the
little
booth
by
the
gate
while
the
other
used
an
intercom
device
presently
they
took
me
along
into
the
hq
building
and
into
an
office
that
said
legate
i
tried
not
to
panic
but
it
was
easy
evidently
i
walked
square
into
another
trap
one
guard
asked
me
all
right
now
what
exactly
is
your
business
in
the
trade
city
i
hoped
to
locate
rakhal
first
now
i
knew
i
have
no
chance
and
at
all
costs
i
must
straighten
out
this
matter
of
identity
before
it
went
any
further
put
me
straight
through
to
magnusson
office
level
at
central
hq
by
visi
i
demanded
i
was
trying
to
remember
if
mack
had
ever
even
heard
the
name
we
used
in
shainsa
i
decided
i
could
risk
it
name
of
race
cargill
the
guard
grinned
without
moving
he
said
to
his
partner
that
the
one
all
right
he
put
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
spinning
me
around
haul
off
man
shake
your
boots
there
were
two
of
them
and
spaceforce
guards
are
picked
for
their
good
looks
just
the
same
i
gave
a
pretty
good
account
of
myself
until
the
inner
door
opened
and
a
man
came
storming
out
what
the
devil
is
all
this
racket
one
guard
got
a
hammerlock
on
me
this
bum
tried
to
talk
us
into
making
a
priority
call
to
magnusson
the
chief
at
central
he
knew
a
couple
of
the
passwords
that
what
got
him
through
the
gate
remember
cargill
passed
the
word
that
somebody
would
turn
up
trying
to
impersonate
him
i
remember
the
strange
man
eyes
were
wary
and
cold
you
damned
fools
i
snarled
magnusson
will
identify
me
ca
you
realize
you
dealing
with
an
impostor
one
of
the
guards
said
to
the
legate
in
an
undertone
maybe
we
ought
to
hold
him
as
a
suspicious
character
but
the
legate
shook
his
head
not
worth
the
trouble
cargill
said
it
was
a
private
affair
you
might
search
him
make
sure
he
not
concealing
contraband
weapons
he
added
and
talked
softly
to
the
clerk
in
the
background
while
the
guards
went
through
my
shirtcloak
and
pockets
when
they
started
to
unwrap
the
toy
i
yelled
if
the
thing
got
set
off
accidentally
there
be
trouble
the
legate
turned
and
rebuked
ca
you
see
it
embroidered
with
the
toad
god
it
a
religious
amulet
of
some
sort
let
it
alone
they
grumbled
but
gave
it
back
to
me
and
the
legate
commanded
mess
him
up
any
more
give
him
back
his
knife
and
take
him
to
the
gates
but
make
sure
he
does
come
back
i
found
myself
seized
and
to
the
gate
one
guard
pushed
my
skean
back
into
its
clasp
the
other
shoved
me
hard
and
i
stumbled
fell
sprawling
in
the
dust
of
the
cobbled
street
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
profane
statement
about
what
i
could
expect
if
i
came
back
a
chorus
of
jeers
from
a
cluster
of
children
and
veiled
women
broke
across
me
i
picked
myself
up
glowered
so
fiercely
at
the
giggling
spectators
that
the
laughter
drained
away
into
silence
and
clenched
my
fists
half
inclined
to
turn
back
and
bull
my
way
through
then
i
subsided
first
round
to
rakhal
he
had
sprung
the
trap
on
me
very
neatly
the
street
was
narrow
and
crooked
winding
between
doubled
rows
of
and
full
of
dark
shadows
even
in
the
crimson
noon
i
walked
aimlessly
favoring
the
arm
the
guard
had
crushed
i
was
no
closer
to
settling
things
with
rakhal
and
i
had
slammed
at
least
one
gate
behind
me
why
had
i
had
sense
enough
to
walk
up
and
demand
to
race
cargill
why
had
i
insisted
on
a
fingerprint
check
i
could
prove
my
identity
and
rakhal
using
my
name
in
my
absence
to
those
who
know
me
by
sight
could
i
could
at
least
have
made
him
try
but
he
had
maneuvered
it
very
cleverly
so
i
never
had
a
chance
to
insist
on
proofs
i
turned
into
a
wineshop
and
ordered
a
dram
of
greenish
mountainberry
liquor
sipping
it
slowly
and
fingering
the
few
bills
and
coins
in
my
pockets
i
better
forget
about
warning
juli
i
could
her
from
charin
except
in
the
terran
zone
i
had
neither
the
money
nor
the
time
to
make
the
trip
in
person
even
if
i
could
get
passage
on
a
airline
after
today
miellyn
she
had
flirted
with
me
and
like
dallisa
she
might
prove
vulnerable
it
might
be
another
trap
but
i
take
the
chance
at
least
i
could
get
hints
about
evarin
and
i
needed
information
i
was
used
to
this
kind
of
intrigue
any
more
the
smell
of
danger
was
foreign
to
me
now
and
i
found
it
unpleasant
the
small
lump
of
the
bird
in
my
pocket
tantalized
me
i
took
it
out
again
it
was
a
temptation
to
press
the
stud
and
let
it
settle
things
or
at
least
start
them
going
then
and
there
after
a
while
i
noticed
the
proprietors
of
the
shop
staring
at
the
silk
of
the
wrappings
they
backed
off
apprehensive
i
held
out
a
coin
and
they
shook
their
heads
you
are
welcome
to
the
drink
one
of
them
said
all
we
have
is
at
your
service
only
please
go
go
quickly
they
would
not
touch
the
coins
i
offered
i
thrust
the
bird
in
my
pocket
swore
and
went
it
was
my
second
experience
with
being
somehow
tabu
and
i
did
like
it
it
was
dusk
when
i
realized
i
was
being
followed
at
first
it
was
a
glimpse
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
a
head
seen
too
frequently
for
coincidence
it
developed
into
a
footstep
in
uneven
rhythm
i
had
my
skean
handy
but
i
had
a
hunch
this
was
anything
i
could
settle
with
a
skean
i
ducked
into
a
side
street
and
waited
nothing
i
went
on
laughing
at
my
imagined
fears
then
after
a
time
the
soft
persistent
footfall
thudded
behind
me
again
i
cut
across
a
thieves
market
dodging
from
stall
to
stall
cursed
by
old
women
selling
hot
fried
goldfish
women
in
striped
veils
railing
at
me
in
their
chiming
talk
when
i
brushed
their
rolled
rugs
with
hasty
feet
far
behind
i
heard
the
familiar
uneven
hurry
i
fled
down
a
street
where
women
sat
on
balconies
their
open
lanterns
flowing
with
fountains
and
rivulets
of
gold
and
orange
fire
i
raced
through
quiet
streets
where
furred
children
crept
to
doors
and
watched
me
pass
with
great
golden
eyes
that
shone
in
the
dark
i
dodged
into
an
alley
and
lay
there
breathing
hard
someone
not
two
inches
away
said
are
you
one
of
us
brother
i
muttered
something
surly
in
his
dialect
and
a
hand
reassuringly
human
closed
on
my
elbow
this
way
out
of
breath
with
long
running
i
let
him
lead
me
meaning
to
break
away
after
a
few
steps
apologize
for
mistaken
identity
and
vanish
when
a
sound
at
the
end
of
the
street
made
me
jerk
stiff
and
listen
i
let
my
arm
relax
in
the
hand
that
guided
me
flung
a
fold
of
my
shirtcloak
over
my
face
and
went
along
with
my
unknown
guide
chapter
thirteen
i
stumbled
over
steps
took
a
jolting
stride
downward
and
found
myself
in
a
dim
room
jammed
with
dark
figures
human
and
nonhuman
the
figures
swayed
in
the
darkness
chanting
in
a
dialect
not
altogether
familiar
to
me
a
monotonous
wailing
chant
with
a
single
recurrent
phrase
kamaina
it
began
on
a
high
note
descending
in
weird
chromatics
to
the
lowest
tone
the
human
ear
could
resolve
the
sound
made
me
draw
back
even
the
shunned
the
orgiastic
rituals
of
kamaina
earthmen
have
a
reputation
for
getting
rid
of
the
more
objectionable
customs
by
human
standards
on
any
planet
where
they
live
but
they
do
touch
religions
and
kamaina
on
the
surface
anyhow
was
a
religion
i
started
to
turn
round
and
leave
as
if
i
had
inadvertently
walked
through
the
wrong
door
but
my
conductor
hauled
on
my
arm
and
i
was
wedged
in
too
tight
by
now
to
risk
a
roughhouse
trying
to
force
my
way
out
would
only
have
called
attention
to
me
and
the
first
of
the
secret
service
maxims
is
when
in
doubt
go
along
keep
quiet
and
watch
the
other
guy
as
my
eyes
adapted
to
the
dim
light
i
saw
that
most
of
the
crowd
were
charin
plainsmen
or
one
or
two
wore
shirtcloaks
and
i
even
thought
i
saw
an
earthman
in
the
crowd
though
i
was
never
sure
and
i
fervently
hope
not
they
were
squatting
around
small
tables
and
all
intently
gazing
at
a
flickery
spot
of
light
at
the
front
of
the
cellar
i
saw
an
empty
place
at
one
table
and
dropped
there
finding
the
floor
soft
as
if
cushioned
on
each
table
small
smudging
pastilles
were
burning
and
from
these
cones
of
fire
came
the
steamy
swimmy
smoke
that
filled
the
darkness
with
strange
colors
beside
me
an
immature
girl
was
kneeling
her
fettered
hands
strained
tightly
back
at
her
sides
her
naked
breasts
pierced
for
jeweled
rings
beneath
the
pallid
fur
around
her
pointed
ears
the
exquisite
animal
face
was
quite
mad
she
whispered
to
me
but
her
dialect
was
so
thick
that
i
could
follow
only
a
few
words
and
would
just
as
soon
not
have
heard
those
few
an
older
grunted
for
silence
and
she
subsided
swaying
and
crooning
there
were
cups
and
decanters
on
all
the
tables
and
a
woman
tilted
pale
phosphorescent
fluid
into
a
cup
and
offered
it
to
me
i
took
one
sip
then
another
it
was
cold
and
pleasantly
tart
and
not
until
the
second
swallow
turned
sweet
on
my
tongue
did
i
know
what
i
tasted
i
pretended
to
swallow
while
the
woman
eyes
were
fixed
on
me
then
somehow
contrived
to
spill
the
filthy
stuff
down
my
shirt
i
was
wary
even
of
the
fumes
but
there
was
nothing
else
i
could
do
the
stuff
was
outlawed
on
every
planet
in
the
terran
empire
and
every
halfway
decent
planet
outside
it
more
and
more
figures
men
and
creatures
kept
crowding
into
the
cellar
which
was
not
very
large
the
place
looked
like
the
worst
nightmare
of
a
ablaze
with
the
colors
of
the
smoking
incense
the
swaying
crowd
and
their
monotonous
cries
quite
suddenly
there
was
a
blaze
of
purple
light
and
someone
screamed
in
raving
ecstasy
ki
na
nebran
kamaina
kamayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeena
shrilled
the
tranced
mob
an
old
man
jumped
up
and
started
haranguing
the
crowd
i
could
just
follow
his
dialect
he
was
talking
about
terra
he
was
talking
about
riots
he
was
jabbering
mystical
gibberish
which
i
could
understand
and
did
want
to
understand
and
propaganda
which
i
understood
much
too
well
another
blaze
of
lights
and
another
long
scream
in
chorus
kamayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeena
evarin
stood
in
the
blaze
of
the
light
the
toymaker
as
i
had
seen
him
last
gracefully
alien
shrouded
in
a
ripple
of
giddy
crimsons
behind
him
was
a
blackness
i
waited
till
the
painful
blaze
of
lights
abated
then
straining
my
eyes
to
see
past
him
i
got
my
worst
shock
a
woman
stood
there
naked
to
the
waist
her
hands
ritually
fettered
with
little
chains
that
stirred
and
clashed
musically
as
she
moved
in
a
frozen
dream
hair
like
black
grass
banded
her
brow
and
naked
shoulders
and
her
eyes
were
crimson
and
the
eyes
lived
in
the
dead
dreaming
face
they
lived
and
they
were
mad
with
terror
although
the
lips
curved
in
a
gently
tranced
smile
miellyn
evarin
was
speaking
in
that
dialect
i
barely
understood
his
arms
were
flung
high
and
his
cloak
went
spilling
away
from
them
rippling
like
something
alive
the
jammed
humans
and
nonhumans
swayed
and
chanted
and
he
swayed
above
them
like
an
iridescent
bug
weaving
arms
rippling
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
i
strained
to
catch
his
words
our
world
an
old
world
kamayeeeeena
whimpered
the
shrill
chorus
humans
humans
all
humans
would
make
slaves
of
us
all
all
save
the
children
of
the
ape
i
lost
the
thread
for
a
moment
true
the
terran
empire
has
one
small
blind
spot
in
otherwise
sane
policy
ignoring
that
nonhuman
and
human
have
lived
placidly
here
for
millennia
they
placidly
assumed
that
humans
were
everywhere
the
dominant
race
as
on
earth
itself
the
toymaker
weaving
arms
went
on
spinning
spinning
i
rubbed
my
eyes
to
clear
them
of
and
incense
i
hoped
that
what
i
saw
was
an
illusion
of
the
drug
something
something
huge
and
dark
was
hovering
over
the
girl
she
stood
placidly
hands
clasped
on
her
chains
but
her
eyes
writhed
in
the
frozen
calm
of
her
face
then
something
i
can
only
call
it
a
sixth
sense
bore
it
on
me
that
there
was
outside
the
door
i
was
perhaps
the
only
creature
there
except
for
evarin
not
drugged
with
and
perhaps
that
all
it
was
but
during
the
days
in
the
secret
service
i
had
to
develop
some
extra
senses
five
just
were
enough
for
survival
i
somebody
was
fixing
to
break
down
that
door
and
i
had
a
good
idea
why
i
been
followed
by
the
legate
orders
and
tracking
me
here
they
gone
away
and
brought
back
reinforcements
someone
struck
a
blow
on
the
door
and
a
stentorian
voice
bawled
open
up
there
in
the
name
of
the
empire
the
chanting
broke
in
ragged
quavers
evarin
stopped
somewhere
a
woman
screamed
the
lights
abruptly
went
out
and
a
stampede
started
in
the
room
women
struck
me
with
chains
men
kicked
there
were
shrieks
and
howls
i
thrust
my
way
forward
butting
with
elbows
and
knees
and
shoulders
a
dusky
emptiness
yawned
and
i
got
a
glimpse
of
sunlight
and
open
sky
and
knew
that
evarin
had
stepped
through
into
and
was
gone
the
banging
on
the
door
sounded
like
a
whole
regiment
of
spaceforce
out
there
i
dived
toward
the
shimmer
of
little
stars
which
marked
tiara
in
the
darkness
braving
the
black
horror
hovering
over
her
and
touched
rigid
cold
as
death
i
grabbed
her
and
ducked
sideways
this
time
it
was
intuition
nine
times
out
of
ten
anyway
intuition
is
just
a
mental
shortcut
which
adds
up
all
the
things
which
your
subconscious
has
noticed
while
you
were
busy
thinking
about
something
else
every
native
building
on
wolf
had
concealed
entrances
and
exits
and
i
know
where
to
look
for
them
this
one
was
exactly
where
i
expected
i
pushed
at
it
and
found
myself
in
a
long
dim
corridor
the
head
of
a
woman
peered
from
an
opening
door
she
saw
miellyn
limp
body
hanging
on
my
arm
and
her
mouth
widened
in
a
silent
scream
then
the
head
popped
back
out
of
sight
and
a
door
slammed
i
heard
the
bolt
slide
i
ran
for
the
end
of
the
hall
the
girl
in
my
arms
thinking
that
this
was
where
i
came
in
as
far
as
miellyn
was
concerned
and
wondering
why
i
bothered
the
door
opened
on
a
dark
peaceful
street
one
lonely
moon
was
setting
beyond
the
rooftops
i
set
miellyn
on
her
feet
but
she
moaned
and
crumpled
against
me
i
put
my
shirtcloak
around
her
bare
shoulders
judging
by
the
noises
and
yells
we
gotten
out
just
in
time
no
one
came
out
the
exit
behind
us
either
the
spaceforce
had
plugged
it
or
more
likely
everyone
else
in
the
cellar
had
been
too
muddled
by
drugs
to
know
what
was
going
on
but
it
was
only
a
few
minutes
i
knew
before
spaceforce
would
check
the
whole
building
for
concealed
escape
holes
suddenly
and
irrelevantly
i
found
myself
thinking
of
a
day
not
too
long
ago
when
i
stood
up
in
front
of
a
of
spaceforce
introduced
to
them
as
an
intelligence
expert
on
native
towns
and
solemnly
warned
them
about
concealed
exits
and
entrances
i
wondered
for
half
a
minute
if
it
might
not
be
simpler
just
to
wait
here
and
let
them
pick
me
up
then
i
hoisted
miellyn
across
my
shoulders
she
was
heavier
than
she
looked
and
after
a
minute
half
conscious
she
began
to
struggle
and
moan
there
was
a
cookshop
down
the
street
a
place
i
once
known
well
with
an
evil
reputation
and
worse
food
but
it
was
quiet
and
stayed
open
all
night
i
turned
in
at
the
door
bending
at
the
low
lintel
the
place
was
and
i
dumped
miellyn
on
a
couch
and
sent
the
frowsy
waiter
for
two
bowls
of
noodles
and
coffee
handed
him
a
few
extra
coins
and
told
him
to
leave
us
alone
he
probably
drew
the
worst
possible
inference
i
saw
his
muzzle
twitch
at
the
smell
of
but
it
was
that
kind
of
place
anyhow
he
drew
down
the
shutters
and
went
i
stared
at
the
unconscious
girl
then
shrugged
and
started
on
the
noodles
my
own
head
was
still
swimmy
with
the
fumes
incense
and
drug
and
i
wanted
it
clear
i
was
quite
sure
what
i
was
going
to
do
but
i
had
evarin
girl
and
i
was
going
to
use
her
the
noodles
were
greasy
and
had
a
curious
taste
but
they
were
hot
and
i
ate
all
of
one
bowl
before
miellyn
stirred
and
whimpered
and
put
up
one
hand
with
a
little
clinking
of
chains
to
her
hair
the
gesture
was
indefinably
reminiscent
of
dallisa
and
for
the
first
time
i
saw
the
likeness
between
them
it
made
me
wary
and
yet
curiously
softened
finding
she
could
not
move
freely
she
rolled
over
sat
up
and
stared
around
in
growing
bewilderment
and
dismay
there
was
a
sort
of
riot
i
said
i
got
you
out
evarin
ditched
you
and
you
can
quit
thinking
what
you
thinking
i
put
my
shirtcloak
on
you
because
you
were
bare
to
the
waist
and
it
did
look
so
good
i
stopped
to
think
that
over
and
amended
i
mean
i
could
haul
you
around
the
streets
that
way
it
looked
good
enough
to
my
surprise
she
gave
a
shaky
little
giggle
and
held
out
her
fettered
hands
will
you
i
broke
her
links
and
freed
her
she
rubbed
her
wrists
as
if
they
hurt
her
then
drew
up
her
draperies
pinned
them
so
that
she
was
decently
covered
and
tossed
back
my
shirtcloak
her
eyes
were
wide
and
soft
in
the
light
of
the
flickering
stub
of
candle
o
rakhal
she
sighed
when
i
saw
you
there
she
sat
up
clasping
her
hands
hard
together
and
when
she
continued
her
voice
was
curiously
cold
and
controlled
for
anyone
so
childish
it
was
almost
as
cold
as
dallisa
if
you
come
from
kyral
i
not
going
back
i
never
go
back
and
you
may
as
well
know
it
i
do
come
from
kyral
and
i
do
care
where
you
go
i
do
care
what
you
do
i
suddenly
realized
that
the
last
statement
was
wholly
untrue
and
to
cover
my
confusion
i
shoved
the
remaining
bowl
of
noodles
at
her
eat
she
wrinkled
her
nose
in
fastidious
disgust
i
not
hungry
eat
it
anyway
you
still
half
doped
and
the
food
will
clear
your
head
i
picked
up
one
mug
of
the
coffee
and
drained
it
at
a
single
swallow
what
were
you
doing
in
that
disgusting
den
without
warning
she
flung
herself
across
the
table
at
me
throwing
her
arms
round
my
neck
startled
i
let
her
cling
a
moment
then
reached
up
and
firmly
unfastened
her
hands
none
of
that
now
i
fell
for
it
once
and
it
landed
me
in
the
middle
of
the
mudpie
but
her
fingers
bit
my
shoulder
rakhal
rakhal
i
tried
to
get
away
and
find
you
have
you
still
got
the
bird
you
have
set
it
off
yet
oh
do
do
do
rakhal
you
do
know
what
evarin
is
you
do
know
what
he
doing
the
words
spilled
out
of
her
like
floodwaters
he
won
so
many
of
you
do
let
him
have
you
too
rakhal
they
call
you
an
honest
man
you
worked
once
for
terra
the
terrans
would
believe
you
if
you
went
to
them
and
told
them
what
he
rakhal
take
me
to
the
terran
zone
take
me
there
take
me
there
where
they
protect
me
from
evarin
at
first
i
tried
to
stop
her
question
her
then
waited
and
let
the
torrent
of
entreaty
run
on
and
on
at
last
exhausted
and
breathless
she
lay
quietly
against
my
shoulder
her
head
fallen
forward
the
musty
reek
of
mingled
with
the
flower
scent
of
her
hair
kid
i
said
heavily
at
last
you
and
your
toymaker
have
both
got
me
wrong
i
not
rakhal
sensar
you
not
she
drew
back
regarding
me
in
dismay
her
eyes
searched
every
inch
of
me
from
the
gray
streak
across
my
forehead
to
the
scar
running
down
into
my
collar
then
who
race
cargill
terran
intelligence
she
stared
her
mouth
wide
like
a
child
then
she
laughed
she
at
first
i
thought
she
was
hysterical
i
stared
at
her
in
consternation
then
as
her
wide
eyes
met
mine
with
all
the
mischief
of
the
nonhuman
which
has
mingled
into
the
human
here
all
the
circular
complexities
of
wolf
illogic
behind
the
woman
in
them
i
started
to
laugh
too
i
threw
back
my
head
and
roared
until
we
were
clinging
together
and
gasping
with
mirth
like
a
pair
of
raving
fools
the
waiter
came
to
the
door
and
stared
at
us
and
i
roared
get
the
hell
out
between
spasms
of
crazy
laughter
then
she
was
wiping
her
face
tears
of
mirth
still
dripping
down
her
cheeks
and
i
was
frowning
bleakly
into
the
empty
bowls
cargill
she
said
hesitantly
you
can
take
me
to
the
terrans
where
rakhal
hell
bells
i
exploded
i
ca
take
you
anywhere
girl
i
got
to
find
rakhal
i
stopped
in
midsentence
and
looked
at
her
clearly
for
the
first
time
child
i
see
that
you
protected
if
i
can
but
i
afraid
walked
from
the
trap
to
the
cookpot
there
is
a
house
in
charin
that
will
hold
me
i
been
thrown
out
twice
today
she
nodded
i
do
know
how
the
word
spreads
but
it
happens
in
nonhuman
parts
i
think
they
can
see
trouble
written
in
a
human
face
or
smell
it
on
the
wind
she
fell
silent
her
face
propped
sleepily
between
her
hands
her
hair
falling
in
tangles
i
took
one
of
her
hands
in
mine
and
turned
it
over
it
was
a
fine
hand
with
birdlike
bones
and
soft
nails
but
the
lines
and
hardened
places
around
the
knuckles
reminded
me
that
she
too
came
from
the
cold
austerity
of
the
salt
after
a
moment
she
flushed
and
drew
her
hand
from
mine
what
are
you
thinking
cargill
she
asked
and
for
the
first
time
i
heard
her
voice
sobered
without
the
coquetry
which
must
after
all
have
been
a
very
thin
veneer
i
answered
her
simply
and
literally
i
am
thinking
of
dallisa
i
thought
you
were
very
different
and
yet
i
see
that
you
are
very
like
her
i
thought
she
would
question
what
i
knew
of
her
sister
but
she
let
it
pass
in
silence
after
a
time
she
said
yes
we
were
twins
then
after
a
long
silence
she
added
but
she
was
always
much
the
older
and
that
was
all
i
ever
knew
of
whatever
obscure
pressures
had
shaped
dallisa
into
an
austere
and
tragic
clytemnestra
and
miellyn
into
a
pixie
runaway
outside
the
drawn
shutters
dawn
was
brightening
miellyn
shivered
drawing
her
thin
draperies
around
her
bare
throat
i
glanced
at
the
little
rim
of
jewels
that
starred
her
hair
and
said
you
better
take
those
off
and
hide
them
they
alone
would
be
enough
to
have
you
hauled
into
an
alley
and
strangled
in
this
part
of
charin
i
hauled
the
bird
toy
from
my
pocket
and
slapped
it
on
the
greasy
table
still
wrapped
in
its
silk
i
do
suppose
you
know
which
of
us
this
thing
is
set
to
kill
i
know
nothing
about
the
toys
you
seem
to
know
plenty
about
the
toymaker
i
thought
so
until
last
night
i
looked
at
the
rigid
clamped
mouth
and
thought
that
if
she
were
really
as
soft
and
delicate
as
she
looked
she
would
have
wept
then
she
struck
her
small
hand
on
the
tabletop
and
burst
out
it
not
a
religion
it
is
even
an
honest
movement
for
freedom
its
a
a
front
for
smuggling
and
drugs
and
and
every
other
filthy
thing
believe
it
or
not
when
i
left
shainsa
i
thought
nebran
was
the
answer
to
the
way
the
terrans
were
strangling
us
now
i
know
there
are
worse
things
on
wolf
than
the
terran
empire
i
heard
of
rakhal
sensar
and
whatever
you
may
think
of
rakhal
he
too
decent
to
be
mixed
up
in
anything
like
this
suppose
you
tell
me
what
really
going
on
i
suggested
she
add
much
to
what
i
knew
already
but
the
last
fragments
of
the
pattern
were
beginning
to
settle
into
place
rakhal
seeking
the
matter
transmitter
and
some
key
to
the
nonhuman
sciences
of
wolf
i
knew
now
what
the
city
of
silent
ones
had
reminded
me
of
had
somehow
crossed
the
path
of
the
toymaker
evarin
words
now
made
sense
were
clever
at
evading
our
surveillance
for
a
possibly
though
i
never
know
cuinn
had
been
keeping
one
foot
in
each
camp
working
for
kyral
and
for
evarin
the
toymaker
knowing
of
rakhal
activities
had
believed
he
would
make
a
valuable
ally
and
had
taken
steps
to
secure
his
help
juli
herself
had
given
me
the
clue
smashed
rindy
out
of
the
context
it
sounded
like
the
work
of
a
madman
now
having
encountered
evarin
workshop
it
made
plain
good
sense
and
i
think
i
had
known
all
along
that
rakhal
could
not
have
been
playing
evarin
game
he
might
have
turned
against
terra
though
now
i
was
beginning
even
to
doubt
that
and
certainly
he
have
killed
me
if
he
found
me
but
he
would
have
done
it
himself
and
without
malice
without
that
does
make
sense
in
any
of
the
languages
of
terra
but
it
made
sense
to
me
miellyn
had
finished
her
brief
recitation
and
was
drowsing
her
head
pillowed
on
the
table
the
reddish
light
was
growing
and
i
realized
that
i
was
waiting
for
dawn
as
days
ago
i
had
waited
for
sunset
in
shainsa
with
every
nerve
stretched
to
the
breaking
point
it
was
dawn
of
the
third
morning
and
this
bird
lying
on
the
table
before
me
must
fly
or
far
away
in
the
kharsa
another
would
fly
at
juli
i
said
there
some
distance
limitation
on
this
one
i
understand
since
i
have
to
be
fairly
near
its
object
if
i
lock
it
in
a
steel
box
and
drop
it
in
the
desert
i
guarantee
it
wo
bother
anybody
i
do
suppose
you
have
a
shot
at
stealing
the
other
one
for
me
she
raised
her
head
eyes
flashing
why
should
you
worry
about
wife
she
flared
and
for
no
good
reason
it
occurred
to
me
that
she
was
jealous
i
might
have
known
evarin
would
shoot
in
the
dark
wife
that
earthwoman
what
do
you
care
for
her
it
seemed
important
to
set
her
straight
i
explained
that
juli
was
my
sister
and
saw
a
little
of
the
tension
fade
from
her
face
but
not
all
remembering
the
custom
of
the
i
was
not
wholly
surprised
when
she
added
jealously
when
i
heard
of
your
feud
i
guessed
it
was
over
that
woman
but
not
in
the
way
you
think
i
said
juli
had
been
part
of
it
certainly
even
then
i
had
not
wanted
her
to
turn
her
back
on
her
world
but
if
rakhal
had
remained
with
terra
i
would
have
accepted
his
marriage
to
juli
accepted
it
i
have
rejoiced
god
knows
we
had
been
closer
than
brothers
those
years
in
the
and
then
before
miellyn
flashing
eyes
i
suddenly
faced
my
secret
hate
my
secret
fear
no
the
quarrel
had
not
been
all
rakhal
doing
he
had
not
turned
his
back
unexplained
on
terra
in
some
unrecognized
fashion
i
had
done
my
best
to
drive
him
away
and
when
he
had
gone
i
had
banished
a
part
of
myself
as
well
and
thought
i
could
end
the
struggle
by
saying
it
did
exist
and
now
facing
what
i
had
done
to
all
of
us
i
knew
that
my
revenge
so
long
sought
so
dearly
cherished
must
be
abandoned
we
still
have
to
deal
with
the
bird
i
said
it
a
gamble
with
all
the
cards
wild
i
could
dismantle
it
and
trust
to
luck
that
wolf
illogic
did
include
a
tamper
mechanism
but
that
did
seem
worth
the
risk
first
i
got
to
rakhal
if
i
set
the
bird
free
and
it
killed
him
it
would
settle
anything
for
i
could
not
kill
rakhal
not
now
because
i
knew
life
would
be
a
worse
punishment
than
death
but
because
i
knew
it
now
if
rakhal
died
juli
would
die
too
and
if
i
killed
him
i
be
killing
the
best
part
of
myself
somehow
rakhal
and
i
must
strike
a
balance
between
our
two
worlds
and
try
to
build
a
new
one
from
them
and
i
ca
sit
here
and
talk
any
longer
i
have
time
to
take
you
i
stopped
remembering
the
spaceport
cafe
at
the
edge
of
the
kharsa
there
was
a
or
matter
transmitter
right
there
across
the
street
from
the
terran
hq
these
years
you
know
your
way
in
the
transmitters
you
can
go
there
in
a
second
or
two
she
could
warn
juli
tell
magnusson
but
when
i
suggested
this
giving
her
a
password
that
would
take
her
straight
to
the
top
she
turned
white
all
jumps
have
to
be
made
through
the
mastershrine
i
stopped
and
thought
about
that
where
is
evarin
likely
to
be
right
now
she
gave
a
nervous
shudder
he
everywhere
rubbish
he
not
omniscient
why
you
little
fool
he
did
even
recognize
me
he
thought
i
was
rakhal
i
was
too
sure
myself
but
miellyn
needed
reassurance
or
take
to
the
mastershrine
i
can
find
rakhal
in
that
scanning
device
of
evarin
i
saw
refusal
in
her
face
and
pushed
on
if
evarin
there
i
prove
he
fallible
enough
with
a
skean
in
his
throat
and
here
i
thrust
the
toy
into
her
hand
hang
on
to
this
will
you
she
put
it
into
her
draperies
i
do
mind
that
but
to
the
shrine
her
voice
quivered
and
i
stood
up
and
pushed
at
the
table
let
get
going
where
the
nearest
no
no
oh
i
do
dare
you
got
to
i
saw
the
who
owned
the
place
edging
round
the
door
again
and
said
there
no
use
arguing
miellyn
when
she
had
readjusted
her
robes
a
little
while
ago
she
had
pinned
them
so
that
the
flat
sprawl
of
the
nebran
embroideries
was
over
her
breasts
i
put
a
finger
against
them
not
in
a
sensuous
gesture
and
said
the
minute
they
see
these
they
throw
us
out
of
here
too
if
you
knew
what
i
know
of
nebran
you
would
me
to
go
near
the
mastershrine
again
there
was
that
faint
coquettishness
in
her
sidewise
smile
and
suddenly
i
realized
that
i
did
want
her
to
but
she
was
not
dallisa
and
she
could
not
sit
in
cold
dignity
while
her
world
fell
into
ruin
miellyn
must
fight
for
the
one
she
wanted
and
then
some
of
that
primitive
male
hostility
which
lives
in
every
man
came
to
the
surface
and
i
gripped
her
arm
until
she
whimpered
then
i
said
in
the
shainsan
which
still
comes
to
my
tongue
when
moved
or
angry
damn
it
you
have
you
forgotten
that
if
it
for
me
you
have
been
torn
to
pieces
by
that
raving
mob
or
something
worse
that
did
it
she
pulled
away
and
i
saw
again
beneath
the
veneer
of
petulant
coquetry
that
fierce
and
untamable
insolence
of
the
the
more
fierce
and
arrogant
in
this
girl
because
she
had
burst
her
fettered
hands
free
and
shaken
off
the
ruin
of
the
past
i
was
seized
with
a
wildly
inappropriate
desire
to
seize
her
crush
her
in
my
arms
taste
the
red
honey
of
that
teasing
mouth
the
effort
of
mastering
the
impulse
made
me
rough
i
shoved
at
her
and
said
come
on
let
get
there
before
evarin
does
chapter
fourteen
outside
in
the
streets
it
was
full
day
and
the
color
and
life
of
charin
had
subsided
into
listlessness
again
a
dim
morning
dullness
and
silence
only
a
few
men
lounged
wearily
in
the
streets
as
if
the
sun
had
sapped
their
energy
and
always
the
pale
children
human
and
furred
nonhuman
played
their
mysterious
games
on
the
curbs
and
gutters
and
staring
at
us
with
neither
curiosity
nor
malice
miellyn
was
shaking
when
she
set
her
feet
into
the
patterned
stones
of
the
scared
miellyn
i
know
evarin
you
do
but
her
mouth
twitched
in
a
pitiful
attempt
at
the
old
mischief
when
i
am
with
a
great
and
valorous
earthman
cut
it
out
i
growled
and
she
giggled
you
have
to
stand
closer
to
me
the
transmitters
are
meant
only
for
one
person
i
stooped
and
put
my
arms
round
her
like
this
like
this
she
whispered
pressing
herself
against
me
a
staggering
whirl
of
dizzy
darkness
swung
round
my
head
the
street
vanished
after
an
instant
the
floor
steadied
and
we
stepped
into
the
terminal
room
in
the
mastershrine
under
a
skylight
dim
with
the
last
red
slant
of
sunset
distant
hammering
noises
rang
in
my
ears
miellyn
whispered
evarin
not
here
but
he
might
jump
through
at
any
second
i
was
listening
where
is
this
place
miellyn
where
on
the
planet
no
one
knows
but
evarin
i
think
there
are
no
doors
anyone
who
goes
in
or
out
jumps
through
the
transmitter
she
pointed
the
scanning
device
is
in
there
we
have
to
go
through
the
workroom
she
was
patting
her
crushed
robes
into
place
smoothing
her
hair
with
fastidious
fingers
i
do
suppose
you
have
a
comb
i
no
time
to
go
to
my
own
i
known
she
was
a
vain
and
pampered
brat
but
this
passed
all
reason
and
i
said
so
exploding
at
her
she
looked
at
me
as
if
i
was
quite
intelligent
the
little
ones
my
friend
notice
things
you
are
quite
enough
of
a
roughneck
but
if
i
nebran
priestess
walk
through
their
workroom
all
blown
about
and
looking
like
the
tag
end
of
an
orgy
in
ardcarran
abashed
i
fished
in
a
pocket
and
offered
her
a
somewhat
battered
pocket
comb
she
looked
at
it
distastefully
but
used
it
to
good
purpose
smoothing
her
hair
swiftly
rearranging
her
robe
so
that
the
worst
of
the
tears
and
stains
were
covered
and
giving
me
meanwhile
an
artless
and
rather
tempting
view
of
some
delicious
curvature
she
replaced
the
starred
tiara
on
her
ringlets
and
finally
opened
the
door
of
the
workroom
and
we
walked
through
not
for
years
had
i
known
that
particular
sensation
thousands
of
eyes
boring
holes
in
the
center
of
my
back
somewhere
there
eyes
the
round
inhuman
orbs
of
the
dwarf
the
faceted
stare
of
the
prism
eyes
of
the
toys
the
workroom
was
a
hundred
feet
long
but
it
felt
longer
than
a
good
many
miles
i
walked
here
and
there
the
dwarfs
murmured
an
obsequious
greeting
to
miellyn
and
she
made
some
lighthearted
answer
she
had
warned
me
to
walk
as
if
i
had
every
right
to
be
there
and
i
strode
after
her
as
if
we
were
simply
going
to
an
meeting
in
the
next
room
but
i
was
drenched
with
cold
sweat
before
the
farther
door
finally
closed
safe
and
blessedly
opaque
behind
us
miellyn
too
was
shaking
with
fright
and
i
put
a
hand
on
her
arm
steady
kid
where
the
scanner
she
touched
the
panel
i
seen
i
not
sure
i
can
focus
it
accurately
evarin
never
let
me
touch
it
this
was
a
fine
time
to
tell
me
that
how
does
it
work
it
an
adaptation
of
the
transmitter
principle
it
lets
you
see
anywhere
but
without
jumping
it
uses
a
tracer
mechanism
like
the
one
in
the
toys
if
rakhal
pattern
were
on
file
just
a
minute
she
fished
out
the
bird
toy
and
unwrapped
it
here
how
we
find
out
which
of
you
this
is
keyed
to
i
looked
at
the
fledgling
bird
lying
innocently
in
her
palm
as
she
pushed
aside
the
feathers
exposing
a
tiny
crystal
if
it
keyed
to
you
you
see
yourself
in
this
as
if
the
screen
were
a
mirror
if
it
keyed
to
rakhal
she
touched
the
crystal
to
the
surface
of
the
screen
little
flickers
of
snow
wavered
and
danced
then
abruptly
we
were
looking
down
from
a
height
at
the
lean
back
of
a
man
in
a
leather
jacket
slowly
he
turned
i
saw
the
familiar
set
of
his
shoulders
saw
the
back
of
his
head
come
into
an
aquiline
profile
and
the
profile
turn
slowly
into
a
scarred
seared
mask
more
hideously
and
disfigured
than
my
own
rakhal
i
muttered
shift
the
focus
if
you
can
miellyn
get
a
look
out
the
window
or
something
charin
a
big
city
if
we
could
get
a
look
at
a
landmark
rakhal
was
talking
soundlessly
his
lips
moving
as
he
spoke
to
someone
out
of
sight
range
of
the
scanning
device
abruptly
miellyn
said
there
she
had
caught
a
window
in
the
sight
field
of
the
pane
i
could
see
a
high
pylon
and
two
of
three
uprights
that
looked
like
a
bridge
just
outside
i
said
it
the
bridge
of
summer
snows
i
know
where
he
is
now
turn
it
off
miellyn
we
can
find
him
i
was
turning
away
when
miellyn
screamed
look
rakhal
had
turned
his
back
on
the
scanner
and
for
the
first
time
i
could
see
who
he
was
talking
to
a
hunched
catlike
shoulder
twisted
a
sinuous
neck
a
head
that
was
not
quite
human
evarin
i
swore
that
does
it
he
knows
now
that
i
not
rakhal
if
he
did
know
it
all
along
come
on
girl
we
getting
out
of
here
this
time
there
was
no
pretense
of
normality
as
we
dashed
through
the
workroom
fingers
dropped
from
toys
as
they
stared
after
us
i
wanted
to
stop
and
smash
them
all
but
if
we
hurried
we
might
find
rakhal
and
with
luck
we
would
find
evarin
with
him
and
then
i
was
going
to
bang
their
heads
together
i
reached
a
saturation
point
on
adventure
i
had
all
i
wanted
i
realized
that
been
up
all
night
that
i
was
exhausted
i
wanted
to
murder
and
smash
and
wanted
to
fall
down
somewhere
and
go
to
sleep
all
at
once
we
banged
the
workroom
door
shut
and
i
took
time
to
shove
a
heavy
divan
against
it
blockading
it
miellyn
stared
the
little
ones
would
not
harm
me
she
began
i
am
sacrosanct
i
was
sure
i
had
a
notion
her
status
had
changed
plenty
beginning
when
i
saw
her
chained
and
drugged
and
standing
under
the
hovering
horror
but
i
did
say
so
maybe
but
there
nothing
sacred
about
she
was
already
inside
the
recess
where
the
toad
god
squatted
there
is
a
just
beyond
the
bridge
of
summer
snows
we
can
jump
directly
there
abruptly
she
froze
in
my
arms
with
a
convulsive
shudder
evarin
hold
me
tight
he
jumping
in
quick
space
reeled
round
us
and
then
can
you
split
instantaneousness
into
fragments
it
did
make
sense
but
so
help
me
that
what
happened
and
everything
that
happened
occurred
within
less
than
a
second
we
landed
in
the
i
could
see
the
pylon
and
the
bridge
and
the
rising
sun
of
charin
then
there
was
the
giddy
internal
wrenching
a
blast
of
icy
air
whistled
round
us
and
we
were
gazing
out
at
the
polar
mountains
ringed
in
their
eternal
snow
miellyn
clutched
at
me
pray
pray
to
the
gods
of
terra
if
there
are
any
she
clung
so
violently
that
it
felt
as
if
her
small
body
was
trying
to
push
through
me
and
come
out
the
other
side
i
hung
on
tight
miellyn
knew
what
she
was
doing
in
the
transmitter
i
was
just
along
for
the
ride
and
i
did
relish
the
thought
of
being
dropped
off
somewhere
in
that
black
limbo
we
traversed
we
jumped
again
the
sickness
of
disorientation
forcing
a
moan
from
the
girl
and
darkness
shivered
round
us
i
looked
on
an
unfamiliar
street
of
black
night
and
stars
she
whimpered
evarin
knows
what
i
doing
he
jumping
us
all
over
the
planet
he
can
work
the
controls
with
his
mind
psychokinetics
i
can
do
it
a
little
but
i
never
dared
oh
hang
on
then
began
one
of
the
most
amazing
duels
ever
fought
miellyn
would
make
some
tiny
movement
and
we
would
be
falling
blind
and
dizzy
through
blackness
halfway
through
the
giddiness
a
new
direction
would
wrench
us
and
we
would
be
thrust
elsewhere
and
look
out
into
a
new
street
one
instant
i
smelled
hot
coffee
from
the
spaceport
cafe
near
the
kharsa
an
instant
later
it
was
blinding
noon
with
crimson
fronds
waving
above
us
and
a
dazzle
of
water
we
flicked
in
and
out
of
the
salty
air
of
shainsa
glimpsed
flowers
on
a
daillon
street
moonlight
noon
red
twilight
flickered
and
went
shot
through
with
the
terrible
giddiness
of
hyperspace
then
suddenly
i
caught
a
second
glimpse
of
the
bridge
and
the
pylon
a
moment
oversight
had
landed
us
for
an
instant
in
charin
the
blackness
started
to
reel
down
but
my
reflexes
are
fast
and
i
made
one
swift
scrabbling
step
forward
we
lurched
sprawled
locked
together
on
the
stones
of
the
bridge
of
summer
snows
battered
and
bruised
and
bloody
we
were
still
alive
and
where
we
wanted
to
be
i
lifted
miellyn
to
her
feet
her
eyes
were
dazed
with
pain
the
ground
swayed
and
rocked
under
our
feet
as
we
fled
along
the
bridge
at
the
far
end
i
looked
up
at
the
pylon
judging
from
its
angle
we
could
be
more
than
a
hundred
feet
from
the
window
through
which
i
seen
that
landmark
in
the
scanner
in
this
street
there
was
a
wineshop
a
silk
market
and
a
small
private
house
i
walked
up
and
banged
on
the
door
silence
i
knocked
again
and
had
time
to
wonder
if
we
find
ourselves
explaining
things
to
some
uninvolved
stranger
then
i
heard
a
high
voice
and
a
deep
familiar
voice
hushing
it
the
door
opened
just
a
crack
to
reveal
part
of
a
scarred
face
it
drew
into
a
hideous
grin
then
relaxed
i
thought
it
might
be
you
cargill
you
taken
at
least
three
days
longer
than
i
figured
getting
here
come
on
in
said
rakhal
sensar
chapter
fifteen
he
had
changed
much
in
six
years
his
face
worse
than
mine
he
had
had
the
plastic
surgeons
of
terran
intelligence
doing
their
best
for
him
his
mouth
i
thought
fleetingly
must
hurt
like
hell
when
he
drew
it
up
into
the
kind
of
grin
he
was
grinning
now
his
eyebrows
thick
and
fierce
with
gray
in
them
went
up
as
he
saw
miellyn
but
he
backed
away
to
let
us
enter
and
shut
the
door
behind
us
the
room
was
bare
and
did
look
as
if
it
had
been
lived
in
much
the
floor
was
stone
a
single
fur
rug
laid
before
a
brazier
a
little
girl
was
sitting
on
the
rug
drinking
from
a
big
mug
but
she
scrambled
to
her
feet
as
we
came
in
and
backed
against
the
wall
looking
at
us
with
wide
eyes
she
had
hair
like
juli
cut
straight
in
a
fringe
across
her
forehead
and
she
was
dressed
in
a
smock
of
dyed
red
fur
that
almost
matched
her
hair
a
little
smear
of
milk
like
a
white
moustache
clung
to
her
upper
lip
where
she
had
forgotten
to
wipe
her
mouth
she
was
about
five
years
old
with
dark
eyes
like
juli
that
watched
me
gravely
without
surprise
or
fear
she
evidently
knew
who
i
was
rindy
rakhal
said
quietly
not
taking
his
eyes
from
me
go
into
the
other
room
rindy
did
move
still
staring
at
me
then
she
moved
toward
miellyn
looking
up
intently
not
at
the
woman
but
at
the
pattern
of
embroideries
across
her
dress
it
was
very
quiet
until
rakhal
added
in
a
gentle
and
curiously
moderate
voice
do
you
still
carry
a
skean
race
i
shook
my
head
there
an
ancient
proverb
on
terra
about
blood
being
thicker
than
water
rakhal
that
juli
daughter
i
not
going
to
kill
her
father
right
before
her
eyes
my
rage
spilled
over
then
and
i
bellowed
to
hell
with
your
damned
feuds
and
your
filthy
toad
god
and
all
the
rest
of
it
rakhal
said
harshly
rindy
i
told
you
to
get
out
she
need
go
i
took
a
step
toward
the
little
girl
a
wary
eye
on
rakhal
i
do
know
quite
what
you
up
to
but
it
nothing
for
a
child
to
be
mixed
up
in
do
what
you
damn
please
i
can
settle
with
you
any
time
the
first
thing
is
to
get
rindy
out
of
here
she
belongs
with
juli
and
damn
it
that
where
she
going
i
held
out
my
arms
to
the
little
girl
and
said
it
over
rindy
whatever
he
done
to
you
your
mother
sent
me
to
find
you
do
you
want
to
go
to
your
mother
rakhal
made
a
menacing
gesture
and
warned
i
would
miellyn
darted
swiftly
between
us
and
caught
up
the
child
in
her
arms
rindy
began
to
struggle
noiselessly
kicking
and
whimpering
but
miellyn
took
two
quick
steps
and
flung
an
inner
door
open
rakhal
took
a
stride
toward
her
she
whirled
on
him
fighting
to
control
the
furious
little
girl
and
gasped
settle
it
between
you
without
the
baby
watching
through
the
open
door
i
briefly
saw
a
bed
a
child
small
dresses
hanging
on
a
hook
before
miellyn
kicked
the
door
shut
and
i
heard
a
latch
being
fastened
behind
the
closed
door
rindy
broke
into
angry
screams
but
i
put
my
back
against
the
door
she
right
we
settle
it
between
the
two
of
us
what
have
you
done
to
that
child
if
you
thought
rakhal
stopped
himself
in
midsentence
and
stood
watching
me
without
moving
for
a
minute
then
he
laughed
you
as
stupid
as
ever
race
why
you
fool
i
knew
juli
would
run
straight
to
you
if
she
was
scared
enough
i
knew
it
would
bring
you
out
of
hiding
why
you
damned
fool
he
stood
mocking
me
but
there
was
a
strained
fury
almost
a
frenzy
of
contempt
behind
the
laughter
you
filthy
coward
race
six
years
hiding
in
the
terran
zone
six
years
and
i
gave
you
six
months
if
you
had
the
guts
to
walk
out
after
me
after
i
rigged
that
final
deal
to
give
you
the
chance
we
could
have
gone
after
the
biggest
thing
on
wolf
and
we
could
have
brought
it
off
together
instead
of
spending
years
spying
and
dodging
and
hunting
and
now
when
i
finally
get
you
out
of
hiding
all
you
want
to
do
is
run
back
where
you
be
safe
i
thought
you
had
more
guts
not
for
evarin
dirty
work
rakhal
swore
hideously
evarin
do
you
really
believe
i
might
have
known
he
get
to
you
too
that
girl
and
you
managed
to
wreck
all
i
did
there
too
suddenly
so
swiftly
my
eyes
could
hardly
follow
he
whipped
out
his
skean
and
came
at
me
get
away
from
that
door
i
stood
my
ground
you
have
to
kill
me
first
and
i
wo
fight
you
rakhal
we
settle
this
but
we
do
it
my
way
for
once
like
earthmen
of
the
ape
get
your
skean
out
you
stinking
coward
i
wo
do
it
rakhal
i
stood
and
defied
him
i
had
outmaneuvered
in
a
bet
i
knew
rakhal
and
i
knew
he
would
not
knife
an
unarmed
man
we
fought
once
with
the
and
it
settle
anything
this
time
we
do
it
my
way
i
threw
my
skean
away
before
i
came
here
i
wo
fight
he
thrust
at
me
even
i
could
see
that
the
blow
was
a
feint
and
i
had
a
flashing
instantaneous
memory
of
dallisa
threat
to
drive
the
knife
through
my
palms
but
even
while
i
commanded
myself
to
stand
steady
sheer
reflex
threw
me
forward
grabbing
at
his
wrist
and
the
knife
between
my
grappling
hand
he
twisted
and
i
felt
the
skean
drive
home
rip
through
my
jacket
with
a
tearing
sound
felt
the
thin
fine
line
of
touch
not
pain
yet
as
it
sliced
flesh
then
pain
burned
through
my
ribs
and
i
felt
hot
blood
and
i
wanted
to
kill
rakhal
wanted
to
get
my
hands
around
his
throat
and
kill
him
with
them
and
at
the
same
time
i
was
raging
because
i
did
want
to
fight
the
crazy
fool
i
was
even
mad
at
him
miellyn
flung
the
door
open
shrieking
and
suddenly
the
toy
released
was
darting
a
small
whirring
droning
horror
straight
at
rakhal
eyes
i
yelled
but
there
was
no
time
even
to
warn
him
i
bent
and
butted
him
in
the
stomach
he
grunted
doubled
up
in
agony
and
fell
out
of
the
path
of
the
diving
toy
it
whirred
in
frustration
hovered
he
writhed
in
agony
drawing
up
his
knees
clawing
at
his
shirt
while
i
turned
on
miellyn
in
immense
fury
and
stopped
hers
had
been
a
move
of
desperation
an
instinctive
act
to
restore
the
balance
between
a
weaponless
man
and
one
who
had
a
knife
rakhal
gasped
in
a
hoarse
voice
with
all
the
breath
gone
from
it
did
want
to
use
rather
fight
clean
then
he
opened
his
closed
fist
and
suddenly
there
were
of
the
little
whirring
droning
horrors
in
the
room
and
this
one
was
diving
at
me
and
as
i
threw
myself
headlong
to
the
floor
the
last
fell
into
place
evarin
had
made
the
same
bargain
with
rakhal
as
with
me
i
rolled
over
dodging
behind
me
in
the
room
there
was
a
child
shrill
scream
daddy
daddy
and
abruptly
the
birds
collapsed
in
midair
and
went
limp
they
fell
to
the
floor
like
dropping
stones
and
lay
there
quivering
rindy
dashed
across
the
room
her
small
skirts
flying
and
grabbed
up
one
of
the
terrible
vicious
things
in
either
hand
rindy
i
bellowed
no
she
stood
shaking
tears
pouring
down
her
round
cheeks
a
toy
squeezed
tight
in
either
hand
dark
veins
stood
out
almost
black
on
her
fair
temples
break
them
daddy
she
implored
in
a
little
thread
of
a
voice
break
them
i
ca
hang
on
rakhal
staggered
to
his
feet
like
a
drunken
man
and
snatched
one
of
the
toys
grinding
it
under
his
heel
he
made
a
grab
at
the
second
reeled
and
drew
an
anguished
breath
he
crumpled
up
clutching
at
his
belly
where
i
butted
him
the
bird
screamed
like
a
living
thing
breaking
my
paralysis
of
horror
i
leaped
up
ran
across
the
room
heedless
of
the
searing
pain
along
my
side
i
snatched
the
bird
from
rindy
and
it
screamed
and
shrilled
and
died
as
my
foot
crunched
the
tiny
feathers
i
stamped
the
thing
into
an
amorphous
mess
and
kept
on
stamping
and
smashing
until
it
was
only
a
heap
of
powder
rakhal
finally
managed
to
haul
himself
upright
again
his
face
was
so
pale
that
the
scars
stood
out
like
fresh
burns
that
was
a
foul
blow
race
but
i
i
know
why
you
did
it
he
stopped
and
breathed
for
a
minute
then
he
muttered
you
saved
my
life
you
know
did
you
know
you
were
doing
it
when
you
did
it
still
breathing
hard
i
nodded
done
knowingly
it
meant
an
end
of
however
we
had
wronged
each
other
whatever
the
pledges
i
spoke
the
words
that
confirmed
it
and
ended
it
finally
and
forever
there
is
a
life
between
us
let
it
stand
for
a
death
miellyn
was
standing
in
the
doorway
her
hands
pressed
to
her
mouth
her
eyes
wide
she
said
shakily
you
walking
around
with
a
knife
in
your
ribs
you
fool
rakhal
whirled
and
with
a
quick
jerk
he
pulled
the
skean
loose
it
had
simply
been
caught
in
my
shirtcloak
in
a
fold
of
the
rough
cloth
he
pulled
it
away
glanced
at
the
red
tip
then
relaxed
not
more
than
an
inch
deep
he
said
then
angrily
defending
himself
you
did
it
yourself
you
ape
i
was
trying
to
get
rid
of
the
knife
when
you
jumped
me
but
i
knew
that
and
he
knew
i
knew
it
he
turned
and
scooped
up
rindy
who
was
sobbing
noisily
she
dug
her
head
into
his
shoulder
and
i
made
out
her
strangled
words
the
other
toys
hurt
you
when
i
was
mad
at
you
she
sobbed
rubbing
her
fists
against
smeared
cheeks
i
i
was
that
mad
at
you
i
was
that
mad
at
anybody
not
even
him
rakhal
pressed
his
hand
against
his
daughter
fleecy
hair
and
said
looking
at
me
over
her
head
the
toys
activate
a
child
subconscious
resentments
against
his
parents
i
found
out
that
much
that
also
means
a
child
can
control
them
for
a
few
seconds
no
adult
can
a
stranger
would
have
seen
no
change
in
his
expression
but
i
knew
him
and
saw
juli
said
you
threatened
rindy
he
chuckled
and
set
the
child
on
her
feet
what
else
could
i
say
that
would
have
scared
juli
enough
to
send
her
running
to
you
juli
proud
almost
as
proud
as
you
are
you
son
of
the
ape
the
insult
did
not
sting
me
now
come
on
sit
down
and
let
decide
what
to
do
now
we
finished
up
the
old
business
he
looked
remotely
at
miellyn
and
said
you
must
be
dallisa
sister
i
do
suppose
your
talents
include
knowing
how
to
make
coffee
they
did
but
with
rindy
help
miellyn
managed
and
while
they
were
out
of
the
room
rakhal
explained
briefly
rindy
has
rudimentary
esp
i
never
had
it
myself
but
i
could
teach
her
something
not
much
about
how
to
use
it
i
been
on
evarin
track
ever
since
that
business
of
the
lisse
i
have
got
it
sooner
if
you
were
still
working
with
me
but
i
could
do
anything
as
a
terran
agent
and
i
had
to
be
kicked
out
so
thoroughly
that
the
others
would
be
afraid
i
was
still
working
secretly
for
terra
for
a
long
time
i
was
just
chasing
rumors
but
when
rindy
got
big
enough
to
look
in
the
crystals
of
nebran
i
started
making
some
progress
i
was
afraid
to
tell
juli
her
best
safety
was
the
fact
that
she
know
anything
she
always
been
a
stranger
in
the
he
paused
then
said
with
honest
since
i
left
the
secret
service
i
been
a
stranger
there
myself
i
asked
what
about
dallisa
twins
have
some
esp
to
each
other
i
knew
miellyn
had
gone
to
the
toymaker
i
tried
to
get
dallisa
to
find
out
where
miellyn
had
gone
learn
more
about
it
dallisa
would
risk
it
but
kyral
saw
me
with
dallisa
and
thought
it
was
miellyn
that
put
him
on
my
tail
too
and
i
had
to
leave
shainsa
i
was
afraid
of
kyral
he
added
soberly
afraid
of
what
he
do
i
could
do
anything
without
rindy
and
i
knew
if
i
told
juli
what
i
was
doing
she
take
rindy
away
into
the
terran
zone
and
i
be
as
good
as
dead
as
he
talked
i
began
to
realize
how
vast
a
web
evarin
and
the
underground
organization
of
nebran
had
spread
for
us
evarin
was
here
today
what
for
rakhal
laughed
mirthlessly
he
been
trying
to
get
us
to
kill
each
other
off
that
would
get
rid
of
us
both
he
wants
to
turn
over
wolf
to
the
nonhumans
entirely
i
think
he
sincere
enough
but
he
spread
his
hands
helplessly
i
ca
sit
by
and
see
it
i
asked
are
you
working
for
terra
or
for
the
or
any
of
the
movements
i
working
for
he
said
with
a
shrug
i
do
think
much
of
the
terran
empire
but
one
planet
ca
fight
a
galaxy
race
i
want
just
one
thing
i
want
the
and
the
rest
of
wolf
to
have
a
voice
in
their
own
government
any
planet
which
makes
a
substantial
contribution
to
galactic
science
by
the
laws
of
the
terran
empire
is
automatically
given
the
status
of
an
independent
commonwealth
if
a
man
from
the
discovers
something
like
a
matter
transmitter
wolf
gets
dominion
status
but
evarin
and
his
gang
want
to
keep
it
secret
keep
it
away
from
terra
keep
it
locked
up
in
places
like
canarsa
somebody
has
to
get
it
away
from
them
and
if
i
do
it
i
get
a
nice
fat
bonus
and
an
official
position
i
believed
that
where
i
would
have
suspected
too
much
protestation
of
altruism
rakhal
tossed
it
aside
you
got
miellyn
to
take
you
through
the
transmitters
go
back
to
the
mastershrine
and
tell
evarin
that
race
cargill
is
dead
in
the
trade
city
they
think
i
cargill
and
i
can
get
in
and
out
as
i
choose
sorry
if
it
caused
you
trouble
but
it
was
the
safest
thing
i
could
think
of
and
i
magnusson
and
have
him
send
soldiers
to
guard
the
evarin
might
try
to
escape
through
one
of
them
i
shook
my
head
terra
has
enough
men
on
all
wolf
to
cover
the
in
charin
alone
and
i
ca
go
back
with
miellyn
i
explained
rakhal
pursed
his
lips
and
whistled
when
i
described
the
fight
in
the
transmitter
you
have
all
the
luck
cargill
i
never
been
near
enough
even
to
be
sure
how
they
work
and
i
bet
you
did
begin
to
understand
have
to
do
it
the
hard
way
then
it
wo
be
the
first
time
bulled
our
way
through
a
tight
place
we
face
evarin
in
his
own
hideout
if
rindy
with
us
we
need
worry
i
was
willing
to
let
him
assume
command
but
i
protested
you
take
a
child
into
that
that
what
else
can
we
do
rindy
can
control
the
toys
and
neither
you
nor
i
can
do
that
if
evarin
should
decide
to
throw
his
whole
arsenal
at
us
he
called
rindy
and
spoke
softly
to
her
she
looked
from
her
father
to
me
and
back
again
to
her
father
then
smiled
and
stretched
out
her
hand
to
me
before
we
ventured
into
the
street
rakhal
scowled
at
the
sprawled
embroideries
of
miellyn
robe
he
said
in
those
things
you
show
up
like
a
snowfall
in
shainsa
if
you
go
out
in
them
you
could
be
mobbed
had
you
better
get
rid
of
them
now
i
ca
she
protested
they
the
keys
to
the
transmitter
rakhal
looked
at
the
conventionalized
idols
with
curiosity
but
said
only
cover
them
up
in
the
street
then
rindy
find
her
something
to
put
over
her
dress
when
we
reached
the
miellyn
admonished
stand
close
together
on
the
stones
i
not
sure
we
can
all
make
the
jump
at
once
but
we
have
to

rakhal
picked
up
rindy
and
hoisted
her
to
his
shoulder
miellyn
dropped
the
cloak
she
had
draped
over
the
pattern
of
the
nebran
embroideries
and
we
crowded
close
together
the
street
swayed
and
vanished
and
i
felt
the
dip
and
swirl
of
blackness
before
the
world
straightened
out
again
rindy
was
whimpering
dabbing
smeary
fists
at
her
face
daddy
my
nose
is
bleeding
miellyn
hastily
bent
and
wiped
the
blood
from
the
snubby
nose
rakhal
gestured
impatiently
the
workroom
wreck
everything
you
see
rindy
if
anything
starts
to
come
at
us
you
stop
it
stop
it
quick
and
he
bent
and
took
the
little
face
between
his
hands
remember
they
not
toys
no
matter
how
pretty
they
are
her
grave
gray
eyes
blinked
and
she
nodded
rakhal
flung
open
the
door
of
the
elves
workshop
with
a
shout
the
ringing
of
the
anvils
shattered
into
a
thousand
dissonances
as
i
kicked
over
a
workbench
and
toys
crashed
in
confusion
to
the
floor
the
dwarfs
scattered
like
rabbits
before
our
assault
of
destruction
i
smashed
tools
filigree
jewels
stamping
everything
with
my
heavy
boots
i
shattered
glass
caught
up
a
hammer
and
smashed
crystals
there
was
a
wild
exhilaration
to
it
a
tiny
doll
proportioned
like
a
woman
dashed
toward
me
shrilling
in
a
supersonic
shriek
i
put
my
foot
on
her
and
ground
the
life
out
of
her
and
she
screamed
like
a
living
woman
as
she
came
apart
her
blue
eyes
rolled
from
her
head
and
lay
on
the
floor
watching
me
i
crushed
the
blue
jewels
under
my
heel
rakhal
swung
a
tiny
hound
by
the
tail
its
head
shattered
into
debris
of
gears
and
wheels
i
caught
up
a
chair
and
wrecked
a
glass
cabinet
of
parts
with
it
swinging
furiously
a
berserk
madness
of
smashing
and
breaking
had
laid
hold
on
me
i
was
drunk
with
crushing
and
shattering
and
ruining
when
i
heard
miellyn
scream
a
warning
and
turned
to
see
evarin
standing
in
the
doorway
his
green
blazed
with
rage
then
he
raised
both
hands
in
a
sudden
sardonic
gesture
and
with
a
loping
inhuman
glide
raced
for
the
transmitter
rindy
rakhal
panted
can
you
block
the
transmitter
instead
rindy
shrieked
we
got
to
get
out
the
roof
is
falling
down
the
house
is
going
to
fall
down
on
us
the
roof
look
at
the
roof
i
looked
up
transfixed
by
horror
i
saw
a
wide
rift
open
saw
the
skylight
shatter
and
break
and
daylight
pouring
through
the
cracking
walls
rakhal
snatched
rindy
up
protecting
her
from
the
falling
debris
with
his
head
and
shoulders
i
grabbed
miellyn
round
the
waist
and
we
ran
for
the
rift
in
the
buckling
wall
we
shoved
through
just
before
the
roof
caved
in
and
the
walls
collapsed
and
we
found
ourselves
standing
on
a
bare
grassy
hillside
looking
down
in
shock
and
horror
as
below
us
section
after
section
of
what
had
been
apparently
bare
hill
and
rock
caved
in
and
collapsed
into
dusty
rubble
miellyn
screamed
hoarsely
run
run
hurry
i
did
understand
but
i
ran
i
ran
my
sides
aching
blood
streaming
from
the
forgotten
in
my
side
miellyn
raced
beside
me
and
rakhal
stumbled
along
carrying
rindy
then
the
shock
of
a
great
explosion
rocked
the
ground
hurling
me
down
full
length
miellyn
falling
on
top
of
me
rakhal
went
down
on
his
knees
rindy
was
crying
loudly
when
i
could
see
straight
again
i
looked
down
at
the
hillside
there
was
nothing
left
of
evarin
hideaway
or
the
mastershrine
of
nebran
except
a
great
gaping
hole
still
oozing
smoke
and
thick
black
dust
miellyn
said
aloud
dazed
so
what
he
was
going
to
do
it
fitted
the
peculiar
nonhuman
logic
of
the
toymaker
he
covered
the
traces
destroyed
rakhal
raged
all
destroyed
the
workrooms
the
science
of
the
toys
the
matter
transmitter
the
minute
we
find
it
destroyed
he
beat
his
fists
furiously
our
one
chance
to
learn
we
were
lucky
to
get
out
alive
said
miellyn
quietly
where
on
the
planet
are
we
i
wonder
i
looked
down
the
hillside
and
stared
in
amazement
spread
out
on
the
hillside
below
us
lay
the
kharsa
topped
by
the
white
skyscraper
of
the
hq
i
be
damned
i
said
right
here
we
home
rakhal
you
can
go
down
and
make
your
peace
with
the
terrans
and
juli
and
you
miellyn
before
the
others
i
could
not
say
what
i
was
thinking
but
i
put
my
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
kept
it
there
she
smiled
shakily
with
a
hint
of
her
old
mischief
i
ca
go
into
the
terran
zone
looking
like
this
can
i
give
me
that
comb
again
rakhal
give
me
your
shirtcloak
my
robes
are
torn
you
vain
stupid
female
worrying
about
a
thing
like
that
at
a
time
like
this
rakhal
look
was
like
murder
i
put
my
comb
in
her
hand
then
suddenly
saw
something
in
the
symbols
across
her
breasts
before
this
i
had
seen
only
the
conventionalized
and
intricate
glyph
of
the
toad
god
but
now
i
reached
out
and
ripped
the
cloth
away
cargill
she
protested
angrily
crimsoning
covering
her
bare
breasts
with
both
hands
is
this
the
place
and
before
a
child
too
i
hardly
heard
look
i
exclaimed
rakhal
look
at
the
symbols
embroidered
into
the
glyph
of
the
god
you
can
read
the
old
nonhuman
glyphs
you
did
it
in
the
city
of
the
lisse
miellyn
said
they
were
the
key
to
the
transmitters
i
bet
the
formula
is
written
out
there
for
anyone
to
read
anyone
that
is
who
read
it
i
ca
but
i
bet
the
formula
equations
for
the
transmitters
are
carved
on
every
toad
god
glyph
on
wolf
rakhal
it
makes
sense
there
are
two
ways
of
hiding
something
either
keep
it
locked
away
or
hide
it
right
out
in
plain
sight
whoever
bothers
even
to
at
a
conventionalized
toad
god
there
are
so
many
of
them
he
bent
his
head
over
the
embroideries
and
when
he
looked
up
his
face
was
flushed
i
believe
by
the
chains
of
sharra
i
believe
you
have
it
race
it
may
take
years
to
work
out
the
glyphs
but
i
do
it
or
die
trying
his
scarred
and
hideous
face
looked
almost
handsome
in
exultation
and
i
grinned
at
him
if
juli
leaves
enough
of
you
once
she
finds
out
how
you
maneuvered
her
look
rindy
fallen
asleep
on
the
grass
there
poor
kid
better
get
her
down
to
her
mother
right
rakhal
thrust
the
precious
embroidery
into
his
shirtcloak
then
cradled
his
sleeping
daughter
in
his
arms
i
watched
him
with
a
curious
emotion
i
could
not
identify
it
seemed
to
pinpoint
some
great
change
either
in
rakhal
or
myself
it
not
difficult
to
visualize
one
sister
with
children
but
there
was
something
some
strange
incongruity
in
the
sight
of
rakhal
carrying
the
little
girl
carefully
tucking
her
up
in
a
fold
of
his
cloak
to
keep
the
sharp
breeze
off
her
face
miellyn
was
limping
in
her
thin
sandals
and
she
shivered
i
asked
cold
no
but
i
do
believe
evarin
is
dead
i
afraid
he
got
away
for
a
minute
the
thought
dimmed
the
luster
of
the
morning
then
i
shrugged
he
probably
buried
in
that
big
hole
up
there
but
i
knew
i
would
never
be
sure
we
walked
abreast
my
arm
around
the
weary
stumbling
woman
and
rakhal
said
softly
at
last
like
old
times
it
was
old
times
i
knew
he
would
know
it
too
once
his
exultation
sobered
i
had
outgrown
my
love
for
intrigue
and
i
had
the
feeling
this
was
rakhal
last
adventure
it
was
going
to
take
him
as
he
said
years
to
work
out
the
equations
for
the
transmitter
and
i
had
a
feeling
my
own
solid
ordinary
desk
was
going
to
look
good
to
me
in
the
morning
but
i
knew
now
that
i
never
run
away
from
wolf
again
it
was
my
own
beloved
sun
that
was
rising
my
sister
was
waiting
for
me
down
below
and
i
was
bringing
back
her
child
my
best
friend
was
walking
at
my
side
what
more
could
a
man
want
if
the
memory
of
dark
eyes
was
to
haunt
me
in
nightmares
they
did
not
come
into
the
waking
world
i
looked
at
miellyn
took
her
slender
unmanacled
hand
in
mine
and
smiled
as
we
walked
through
the
gates
of
the
city
now
after
all
my
years
on
wolf
i
understood
the
desire
to
keep
their
women
under
lock
and
key
that
was
its
ancient
custom
i
vowed
to
myself
as
we
went
that
i
should
waste
no
time
finding
a
fetter
shop
and
having
forged
therein
the
perfect
steel
chains
that
should
bind
my
love
wrists
to
my
key
