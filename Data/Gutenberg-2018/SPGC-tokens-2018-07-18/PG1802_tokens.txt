i
come
no

to
make
you
laugh
things
now
that
bear
a
weighty
and
a
serious
brow
sad
high
and
working
full
of
state
and
woe
such
noble
scenes
as
draw
the
eye
to
flow
we
now
present
those
that
can
pity
here
may
if
they
think
it
well
let
fall
a
tear
the
subject
will
deserve

such
as

out
of
hope
they
may
believe
may
here
find
truth
too
those
that
come
to
see
only
a
show
or
two
and
so
agree
the
play
may
pass
if
they
be
still
and
willing
i
undertake
may
see
away
their
shilling
richly
in
two
short
hours
only
they
that
come
to
hear
a
merry
bawdy
play
a
noise
of
targets
or
to
see
a
fellow
in
a
long
motley
coat
guarded
with
yellow
will
be
deceiv
for
gentle
hearers
know
to
rank
our
chosen
truth
with
such
a
show
as
fool
and
fight
is
beside
forfeiting
our
own
brains
and
the
opinion
that
we
bring
to
make
that
only
true
we
now
intend
will
leave
us
never
an
understanding
friend
therefore
for
goodness
sake
and
as
you
are
known
the
first
and
happiest
hearers
of
the
town
be
sad
as
we
would
make
ye
think
ye
see
the
very
persons
of
our
noble
story
as
they
were
living
think
you
see
them
great
and
follow
with
the
general
throng
and
sweat
of
thousand
friends
then
in
a
moment
see
how
soon
this
mightiness
meets
misery
and
if
you
can
be
merry
then
i
say
a
man
may
weep
upon
his
act
i

good
morrow

have
ye
done
since

we
saw
in

norfolk
i
thank
your
grace
healthful
and
ever
since
a
fresh
admirer
of
what
i
saw
there
buckingham
an
untimely
ague
stay
me
a
prisoner
in
my
chamber
when
those
suns
of
glory
those
two
lights
of
men
met
in
the
vale
of
andren
norfolk
guynes
and
arde
i
was
then
present
saw
them
salute
on
horseback
beheld
them
when
they
lighted
how
they
clung
in
their
embracement
as
they
grew
together
which
had
they
what
four
thron
ones
could
have
such
a
compounded
one
buckingham
all
the
whole
time
i
was
my
chamber
prisoner
norfolk
then
you
lost
the
view
of
earthly
glory
men
might
say
till
this
time
pomp
was
single
but
now
married
to
one
above
itself
each
following
day
became
the
next
day
master
till
the
last
made
former
wonders
its
the
french
all
clinquant
all
in
gold
like
heathen
gods
shone
down
the
english
and
they
made
britain
india
every
man
that
stood
show
like
a
mine
their
dwarfish
pages
were
as
cherubins
all
gilt
the
madams
too
not
us
to
toil
did
almost
sweat
to
bear
the
pride
upon
them
that
their
very
labour
was
to
them
as
a
painting
now
this
masque
was
cried
incomparable
and
th
ensuing
night
made
it
a
fool
and
beggar
the
two
kings
equal
in
lustre
were
now
best
now
worst
as
presence
did
present
them
him
in
eye
still
him
in
praise
and
being
present
both
was
said
they
saw
but
one
and
no
discerner
durst
wag
his
tongue
in
censure
when
these
suns
for
so
they
phrase
by
their
heralds
the
noble
spirits
to
arms
they
did
perform
beyond
thought
compass
that
former
fabulous
story
being
now
seen
possible
enough
got
credit
that
bevis
was
believ
buckingham
o
you
go
far
norfolk
as
i
belong
to
worship
and
affect
in
honour
honesty
the
tract
of
would
by
a
good
discourser
lose
some
life
which
action
self
was
tongue
to
all
was
royal
to
the
disposing
of
it
nought
rebell
order
gave
each
thing

the
office
did
distinctly
his
full
function
buckingham
who
did
guide
i
mean
who
set
the
body
and
the
limbs
of
this
great
sport
together
as
you
guess
norfolk
one
certes
that
promises
no
element
in
such
a
business
buckingham
i
pray
you
who
my
lord
norfolk
all
this
was
by
the
good
discretion
of
the
right
reverend
cardinal
of
york
buckingham
the
devil
speed
him
no
man
pie
is
freed
from
his
ambitious
finger
what
had
he
to
do
in
these
fierce
vanities
i
wonder
that
such
a
keech
can
with
his
very
bulk
take
up
the
rays
o
th
beneficial
sun
and
keep
it
from
the
earth
norfolk
surely
sir
there
in
him
stuff
that
puts
him
to
these
ends
for
being
not
propp
by
ancestry
whose
grace
chalks
successors
their
way
nor
call
upon
for
high
feats
done
to
th
crown
neither
allied
to
eminent
assistants
but
out
of
his
web
gives
us
note
the
force
of
his
own
merit
makes
his
way
a
gift
that
heaven
gives
for
him
which
buys
a
place
next
to
the
king
abergavenny
i
can
not
tell
what
heaven
hath
given
him
let
some
graver
eye
pierce
into
that
but
i
can
see
his
pride
peep
through
each
part
of
him
whence
has
he
that
if
not
from
hell
the
devil
is
a
niggard
or
has
given
all
before
and
he
begins
a
new
hell
in
himself
buckingham
why
the
devil
upon
this
french
going
out
took
he
upon
him
without
the
privity
o
th
king
t
appoint
who
should
attend
on
him
he
makes
up
the
file
of
all
the
gentry
for
the
most
part
such
to
whom
as
great
a
charge
as
little
honour
he
meant
to
lay
upon
and
his
own
letter
the
honourable
board
of
council
out
must
fetch
him
in
he
papers
abergavenny
i
do
know
kinsmen
of
mine
three
at
the
least
that
have
by
this
so
sicken
their
estates
that
never
they
shall
abound
as
formerly
buckingham
o
many
have
broke
their
backs
with
laying
manors
on
for
this
great
journey
what
did
this
vanity
but
minister
communication
of
a
most
poor
issue
norfolk
grievingly
i
think
the
peace
between
the
french
and
us
not
values
the
cost
that
did
conclude
it
buckingham
every
man
after
the
hideous
storm
that
follow
was
a
thing
inspir
and
not
consulting
broke
into
a
general
prophecy
that
this
tempest
dashing
the
garment
of
this
peace
aboded
the
sudden
breach
o
norfolk
which
is
budded
out
for
france
hath
flaw
the
league
and
hath
our
merchants
goods
at
bordeaux
abergavenny
is
it
therefore
th
ambassador
is
silenc
norfolk
marry
abergavenny
a
proper
tide
of
a
peace
and
at
a
superfluous
rate
buckingham
why
all
this
business
our
reverend
cardinal
carried
norfolk
like
it
your
grace
the
state
takes
notice
of
the
private
difference
betwixt
you
and
the
cardinal
i
advise
you
and
take
it
from
a
heart
that
wishes
towards
you
honour
and
plenteous
safety
that
you
read
the
cardinal
malice
and
his
potency
together
to
consider
further
that
what
his
high
hatred
would
effect
wants
not
a
minister
in
his
power
you
know
his
nature
that
he
revengeful
and
i
know
his
sword
hath
a
sharp
edge
it
long
and
may
be
said
it
reaches
far
and
where
not
extend
thither
he
darts
it
bosom
up

counsel

it
wholesome

buckingham
sir
i
am
thankful
to
you
and
i
go
along
by
your
prescription
but
this
fellow
whom
from
the
flow
of
gall
i
name
not
but
from
sincere
motions
by
intelligence
and
proofs
as
clear
as
founts
in
july
when
we
see
each
grain
of
gravel
i
do
know
to
be
corrupt
and
treasonous
norfolk
say
not
treasonous
buckingham
to
th
king
i
and
make
my
vouch
as
strong
as
shore
of
rock
attend
this
holy
fox
or
wolf
or
both
for
he
is
equal
as
he
is
subtle
and
as
prone
to
mischief
as
able
to
his
mind
and
place
infecting
one
another
yea
reciprocally
only
to
show
his
pomp
as
well
in
france
as
here
at
home
suggests
the
king
our
master
to
this
last
costly
treaty
th
interview
that
swallowed
so
much
treasure
and
like
a
glass
did
break
i
th
wrenching
norfolk
faith
and
so
it
did
buckingham
pray
give
me
favour
sir
this
cunning
cardinal
the
articles
o
th
combination
drew
as
himself
pleas
and
they
were
ratified
as
he
cried
let
be
to
as
much
end
as
give
a
crutch
to
th
dead
but
our
has
done
this
and
is
well
for
worthy
wolsey
who
can
not
err
he
did
it
now
this
follows
which
as
i
take
it
is
a
kind
of
puppy
to
th
old
dam
treason
charles
the
emperor
under
pretence
to
see
the
queen
his
aunt
for
was
indeed
his
colour
but
he
came
to
whisper
wolsey
here
makes
visitation
his
fears
were
that
the
interview
betwixt
england
and
france
might
through
their
amity
breed
him
some
prejudice
for
from
this
league
peep
harms
that
menac
him
privily
deals
with
our
cardinal
and
as
i
trow
which
i
do
well
for
i
am
sure
the
emperor
paid
ere
he
promis
whereby
his
suit
was
granted
ere
it
was
ask
but
when
the
way
was
made
and
pav
with
gold
the
emperor
thus
desir
that
he
would
please
to
alter
the
king
course
and
break
the
foresaid
peace
let
the
king
know
as
soon
he
shall
by
me
that
thus
the
cardinal
does
buy
and
sell
his
honour
as
he
pleases

for
his

advantage

you
that

of

wolsey
please
you
sir
i
know

of

in

where
others
tell
steps
with
me
queen
katharine
no
my
lord
you
know
no
more
than
others
but
you
frame
things
that
are
known
alike
which
are
not
wholesome
to
those
which
would
not
know
them
and
yet
must
perforce
be
their
acquaintance
these
exactions
whereof
my
sovereign
would
have
note
they
are
most
pestilent
to
th
hearing
and
to
bear
the
back
is
sacrifice
to
th
load
they
say
they
are
devis
by
you
or
else
you
suffer
too
hard
an
exclamation
king
still
exaction
the
nature
of
it
in
what
kind
let

is
this
exaction
queen

i
am
much
too
venturous
in
tempting
of
your
patience
but
am
under
your
promis
pardon
the
subjects
grief
comes
through
commissions
which
compels
from
each
the
sixth
part
of
his
substance
to
be
levied
without
delay
and
the
pretence
for
this
is
nam
your
wars
in
france
this
makes
bold
mouths
tongues
spit
their
duties
out
and
cold
hearts
freeze
allegiance
in
them
their
curses
now
live
where
their
prayers
did
and
it
come
to
pass
this
tractable
obedience
is
a
slave
to
each
incensed
will
i
would
your
highness
would
give
it
quick
consideration
for
there
is
no
primer
business
king
by
my
life
this
is
against
our
pleasure
wolsey
and
for
me
i
have
no
further
gone
in
this
than
by
a
single
voice
and
that
not
pass
me
but
by
learned
approbation
of
the
judges
if
i
am
traduc
by
ignorant
tongues
which
neither
know
my
faculties
nor
person
yet
will
be
the

let
me
say
is
but
the
fate
of

the
rough
brake
that
virtue
must
go
through
we
must
not
stint
our
necessary
actions
in
the
fear

malicious

ever

of
buckingham
king
speak
freely
surveyor
first
it
was
usual
with
him
every
day
it
would
infect
his
speech
that
if
the
king
should
without
issue
die
he
carry
it
so
to
make
the
sceptre
his
these
very
words
i
heard
him
utter
to
his
lord
to
whom
by
oath
he
revenge
upon
the
cardinal
wolsey
please
your
highness
note
this
dangerous
conception
in
this
point
not
friended
by
his
wish
to
your
high
person
his
will
is
most
malignant
and
it
stretches
beyond
you
to
your
friends
queen
katharine
my
learn
lord
cardinal
deliver
all
with
charity
king
speak
on
how
grounded
he
his
title
to
the
crown
upon
our
fail
to
this
point
hast
thou
heard
him
at
any
time
speak
aught
surveyor
he
was
brought
to
this
by
a
vain
prophecy
of
nicholas
henton
king
what
was
that
henton
surveyor
sir
a
chartreux
friar
his
confessor
who
fed
him
every
minute
with
words
of
sovereignty
king
how
thou
this
surveyor
not
long
before
your
highness
sped
to
france
the
duke
being
at
the
rose
within
the
parish
saint
lawrence
poultney
did
of
me
demand
what
was
the
speech
among
the
londoners
concerning
the
french
journey
i
replied
men
fear
the
french
would
prove
perfidious
to
the
king
danger
presently
the
duke
said
was
the
fear
indeed
and
that
he
doubted
prove
the
verity
of
certain
words
spoke
by
a
holy
monk
oft
says
he
sent
to
me
wishing
me
to
permit
john
de
la
car
my
chaplain
a
choice
hour
to
hear
from
him
a
matter
of
some
moment
whom
after
under
the
confession
seal
he
solemnly
had
sworn
that
what
he
spoke
my
chaplain
to
no
creature
living
but
to
me
should
utter
with
demure
confidence
this
pausingly
ensu
neither
the
king
nor
heirs
tell
you
the
duke
shall
prosper
bid
him
strive
to
gain
the
love
o
th
commonalty
the
duke
shall
govern
england
queen
katharine
if
i
know
you
well
you
were
the
duke
surveyor
and
lost
your
office
on
the
complaint
o
th
tenants
take
good
heed
you
charge
not
in
your
spleen
a
noble
person
and
spoil
your
nobler
soul
i
say
take
heed
yes
heartily
beseech
you
king
let
him
on
go
forward
surveyor
on
my
soul
i
speak
but
truth
i
told
my
lord
the
duke
by
th
devil
illusions
the
monk
might
be
deceiv
and
that
was
dangerous
for
him
to
ruminate
on
this
so
far
until
it
forg
him
some
design
which
being
believ
it
was
much
like
to
do
he
answer
it
can
do
me
no
damage
adding
further
that
had
the
king
in
his
last
sickness
fail
the
cardinal

sir
thomas

gentlemen
at
several
doors
first
gentleman
whither
away
so
fast
second
gentleman
o
god
save
ye
to
the
hall
to
hear
what
shall
become
of
the
great
duke
of
buckingham
first
gentleman
i
save
you
that
labour
sir
all
now
done
but
the
ceremony
of
bringing
back
the
prisoner
second
gentleman
were
you
there
first
gentleman
yes
indeed
was
i
second
gentleman
pray
speak
what
has
happen
first
gentleman
you
may
guess
quickly
what
second
gentleman
is
he
found
guilty
first
gentleman
yes
truly
is
he
and
condemn
upo
second
gentleman
i
am
sorry
first
gentleman
so
are
a
number
more
second
gentleman
but
pray
how
pass
it
first
gentleman
i
tell
you
in
a
little
the
great
duke
came
to
the
bar
where
to
his
accusations
he
pleaded
still
not
guilty
and
alleged
many
sharp
reasons
to
defeat
the
law
the
king
attorney
on
the
contrary
urg
on
the
examinations
proofs
confessions
of
divers
witnesses
which
the
duke
to
have
brought
viva
voce
to
his
face
at
which
appear
against
him
his
surveyor
sir
gilbert
peck
his
chancellor
and
john
car
confessor
to
him
with
that
hopkins
that
made
this
mischief
second
gentleman
that
was
he
that
fed
him
with
his
prophecies
first
gentleman
the
same
all
these
accus
him
strongly
which
he
fain
would
have
flung
from
him
but
indeed
he
could
not
and
so
his
peers
upon
this
evidence
have
found
him
guilty
of
high
treason
much
he
spoke
and
learnedly
for
life
but
all
was
either
pitied
in
him
or
forgotten
second
gentleman
after
all
this
how
did
he
bear
first
gentleman
when
he
was
brought
again
to
th
bar
to
hear
his
knell
rung
out
his
judgment
he
was
with
such
an
agony
he
sweat
extremely
and
something
spoke
in
choler
ill
and
hasty
but
he
fell
to
himself
again
and
sweetly
in
all
the
rest
show
a
most
noble
patience
second
gentleman
i
do
not
think
he
fears
death
first
gentleman
sure
he
does
not
he
never
was
so
womanish
the
cause
he
may
a
little
grieve
at
second
gentleman
certainly
the
cardinal
is
the
end
of
this
first
gentleman
is
likely
by
all
conjectures
first
kildare
attainder
then
deputy
of
ireland
who
remov
earl
surrey
was
sent
thither
and
in
haste
too
lest
he
should
help
his
father
second
gentleman
that
trick
of
state
was
a
deep
envious
one
first
gentleman
at
his
return
no
doubt
he
will
requite
it
this
is
noted
and
generally
whoever
the
king
favours
the
cardinal
instantly
will
find
employment
and
far
enough
from
court
too
second
gentleman
all
the
commons
hate
him
perniciously
and
o
my
conscience
wish
him
ten
fathom
deep

it
and
with
that
blood
will
make
one
day

my
noble
father

must
needs
say
a
noble
one
which

a
little
happier

one
in
fortunes

by
our
servants
by
those

most
a
most
unnatural
and
faithless
service

an
end
in

this
from

where

where
they
mean
to
sink

must
now
forsake

the
last
hour
of
my
long
weary

exeunt
buckingham
and
train
first
gentleman
o
this
is
full
of
pity
sir
it
calls
i
fear
too
many
curses
on
their
heads
that
were
the
authors
second
gentleman
if
the
duke
be
guiltless
is
full
of
woe
yet
i
can
give
you
inkling
of
an
ensuing
evil
if
it
fall
greater
than
this
first
gentleman
good
angels
keep
it
from
us
what
may
it
be
you
do
not
doubt
my
faith
sir
second
gentleman
this
secret
is
so
weighty
require
a
strong
faith
to
conceal
it
first
gentleman
let
me
have
it
i
do
not
talk
much
second
gentleman
i
am
confident
you
shall
sir
did
you
not
of
late
days
hear
a
buzzing
of
a
separation
between
the
king
and
katharine
first
gentleman
yes
but
it
held
not
for
when
the
king
once
heard
it
out
of
anger
he
sent
command
to
the
lord
mayor
straight
to
stop
the
rumour
and
allay
those
tongues
that
durst
disperse
it
second
gentleman
but
that
slander
sir
is
found
a
truth
now
for
it
grows
again
fresher
than
it
was
and
held
for
certain
the
king
will
venture
at
it
either
the
cardinal
or
some
about
him
near
have
out
of
malice
to
the
good
queen
possess
him
with
a
scruple
that
will
undo
her
to
confirm
this
too
cardinal
campeius
is
arriv
and
lately
as
all
think
for
this
business
first
gentleman
is
the
cardinal
and
merely
to
revenge
him
on
the
emperor
for
not
bestowing
on
him
at
his
asking
the
archbishopric
of
toledo
this
is
purpos
second
gentleman
i
think
you
have
hit
the
mark
but
not
cruel
that
she
should
feel
the
smart
of
this
the
cardinal
will
have
his
will
and
she
must
fall
first
gentleman
is
woeful
we
are
too
open
here

a
man
of
my
lord
cardinal
by
commission
and
main
power
took
from

has
crept
too
near

no
his

he
has
crack
the
league
between
us
and
the
emperor
the
queen
great
nephew
he
dives
into
the
king
soul
and
there
scatters
dangers
doubts
wringing
of
the
conscience
fears
and
despairs
and
all
these
for
his
marriage
and
out
of
all
these
to

justified
you

have
wish

sleeping
of
this
business

but
oft
have
oft
the
passages
made
toward
it
on
my
honour
i
speak
my
good
lord
cardinal
to
this
point
and
thus
far
clear
him
now
what
mov
me
i
will
be
bold
with
time
and
your
attention
then
mark
th
inducement
thus
it
came
give
heed
my
conscience
first
receiv
a
tenderness
scruple
and
prick
on
certain
speeches
by
th
bishop
of
bayonne
then
french
ambassador
who
had
been
hither
sent
on
the
debating
a
marriage
the
duke
of
orleans
and
our
daughter
mary
i
th
progress
of
this
business
ere
a
determinate
resolution
he
i
mean
the
require
a
respite
wherein
he
might
the
king
his
lord
advertise
whether
our
daughter
were
legitimate
respecting
this
our
marriage
with
the
dowager
sometimes
our
brother
wife
this
respite
shook
the
bosom
of
my
conscience
enter
me
yea
with
a
splitting
power
and
made
to
tremble
the
region
of
my
breast
which
forc
such
way
that
many
maz
considerings
did
throng
and
press
in
with
this
caution
first
methought
i
stood
not
in
the
smile
of
heaven
who
had
commanded
nature
that
my
lady
womb
if
it
conceiv
a
male
child
by
me
should
do
no
more
offices
of
life
than
the
grave
does
to
the
dead
for
her
male
issue
or
died
where
they
were
made
or
shortly
after
this
world
had
air
them
hence
i
took
a
thought
this
was
a
judgment
on
me
that
my
kingdom
well
worthy
the
best
heir
o
th
world
should
not
be
gladded
i
by
me
then
follows
that
i
weigh
the
danger
which
my
realms
stood
in
by
this
my
issue
fail
and
that
gave
to
me
many
a
groaning
throe
thus
hulling
in
the
wild
sea
of
my
conscience
i
did
steer
toward
this
remedy
whereupon
we
are
now
present
here
together
that
to
say
i
meant
to
rectify
my
conscience
which
i
then
did
feel
full
sick
and
yet
not
well
by
all
the
reverend
fathers
of
the
land
and
doctors
learn
first
i
began
in
private
with
you
my
lord
of
lincoln
you
remember
how
under
my
oppression
i
did
reek
when
i
first
mov
you
lincoln
very
well
my
liege
king
i
have
spoke
long
be
pleas
yourself
to
say
how
far
you
satisfied
me
lincoln
so
please
your
highness
the
question
did
at
first
so
stagger
me
bearing
a
state
of
mighty
moment
and
consequence
of
dread
that
i
committed
the
counsel
which
i
had
to
doubt
and
did
entreat
your
highness
to
this
course
which
you
are
running
here
king
i
then
mov
you
my
lord
of
canterbury
and
got
your
leave
to
make
this
present
summons
unsolicited
i
left
no
reverend
person
in
this
court
but
by
particular
consent
proceeded
under
your
hands
and
seals
therefore
go
on
for
no
dislike
i
th
world
against
the
person
of
the
good
queen
but
the
sharp
thorny
points
of
my
alleged
reasons
drives
this
forward
prove
but
our
marriage
lawful
by
my
life
and
kingly
dignity
we
are
contented
to
wear
our
moral
state
to
come
with
her
katharine
our
queen
before
the
primest
creature
that
paragon
o
th
world
campeius
so
please
your
highness
the
queen
being
absent
is
a
needful
fitness
that
we
adjourn
this
court
till
further
day
meanwhile

be
an
earnest
motion
made
to
the
queen
to
call
back
her
appeal

intends
unto
his
holiness

how
that
the

did
entreat
his
holiness

the
judgment
o

my

bites
his

and
starts
stops
on
a
sudden
looks
upon
the
ground
then
lays
his
finger
on
his
temple
straight
springs
out
into
fast
gait
then
stops
again
strikes
his
breast
hard
and
anon
he
casts
his
eye
against
the
moon
in
most
strange
postures
we
have
seen
him
set
himself
king
it

unwittingly
forsooth
an
inventory
thus
importing
the
several
parcels
of
his
plate
his
treasure
rich
stuffs
and
ornaments
of
household
which
i
find
at
such
proud
rate
that
it
outspeaks
possession

it
heaven
will
some
spirit
put
this
paper
in

did
think
his
contemplation
were
above
the
earth
and
fix
on
spiritual
object
he
should
still
dwell
in
his
musings
but
i
am
afraid
his
thinkings
are
below
the
moon
not
worth
his
serious
considering

takes
his
seat
and
whispers

are
in
the

hand
but
thus
much
they
are
foul
ones

arise
when

knows
my

surrey
this
can
not
save
you
i
thank
my
memory

remember
some
of
these
articles

out
they
shall
now
if
you
can
blush
and
cry
guilty
cardinal
you
show
a
little
honesty
wolsey
speak
on
sir
i
dare
your
worst
objections
if
i
blush
it
is
to
see
a
nobleman
want
manners
surrey
i
had
rather
want
those
than
my
head
have
at
you
first
that
without
the
king
assent
or
knowledge
you
wrought
to
be
a
legate
by
which
power
you
maim
the
jurisdiction
of
all
bishops
norfolk
then
that
in
all
you
writ
to
rome
or
else
to
foreign
princes
et
rex
was
still
inscrib
in
which
you
brought
the
king
to
be
your
servant
suffolk
then
that
without
the
knowledge
either
of
king
or
council
when
you
went
ambassador
to
the
emperor
you
made
bold
to
carry
into
flanders
the
great
seal
surrey
item
you
sent
a
large
commission
to
gregory
de
cassado
to
conclude
without
the
king
will
or
the
state
allowance
a
league
between
his
highness
and
ferrara
suffolk
that
out
of
mere
ambition
you
have
your
holy
hat
to
be
stamp
on
the
king
coin
surrey
then
that
you
have
sent
innumerable
substance
by
what
means
got
i
leave
to
your
own
conscience
to
furnish
rome
and
to
prepare
the
ways
you
have
for
dignities
to
the
mere
undoing
of
all
the
kingdom
many
more
there
are
which
since
they
are
of
you
and
odious
i
will
not
taint
my
mouth
with
chamberlain
o
my
lord
press
not
a
falling
man
too
far
is
virtue
his
faults
lie
open
to
the
laws
let
them
not
you
correct
him
my
heart
weeps
to
see
him
so
little
of
his
great
self
surrey
i
forgive
him
suffolk
lord
cardinal
the
king
further
pleasure
is
because
all
those
things
you
have
done
of
late
by
your
power
legatine
within
this
kingdom
fall
into
th
compass
of
a
praemunire
that
therefore
such
a
writ
be
sued
against
you
to
forfeit
all
your
goods
lands
tenements
chattels
and
whatsoever
and
to
be
out
of
the
king
protection
this
is
my
charge
norfolk
and
so
we
leave
you
to
your
meditations
how
to
live
better
for
your
stubborn
answer
about
the
giving
back
the
great
seal
to
us
the
king
shall
know
it
and
no
doubt
shall
thank
you
so
fare
you
well
my
little
good
lord
cardinal
exeunt
all
but
wolsey
wolsey
so
farewell
to
the
little
good
you
bear
me
farewell
a
long
farewell
to
all
my
greatness
this
is
the
state
of
man
he
puts
forth
the
tender
leaves
of
hopes
blossoms
and
bears
his
blushing
honours
thick
upon
him
the
third
day
comes
a
frost
a
killing
frost
and
when
he
thinks
good
easy
man
full
surely
his
greatness
is
nips
his
root
and
then
he
falls
as
i
do
i
have
ventur
like
little
wanton
boys
that
swim
on
bladders
this
many
summers
in
a
sea
of
glory
but
far
beyond
my
depth
my
pride
at
length
broke
under
me
and
now
has
left
me
weary
and
old
with
service
to
the
mercy
of
a
rude
stream
that
must
for
ever
hide
me
vain
pomp
and
glory
of
this
world
i
hate
ye
i
feel
my
heart
new
open
o
how
wretched
is
that
poor
man
that
hangs
on
princes
favours
there
is
betwixt
that
smile
we
would
aspire
to
that
sweet
aspect
of
princes
and
their
ruin
more
pangs
and
fears
than
wars
or
women
have
and
when
he
falls
he
falls
like
lucifer
never
to
hope
again
enter
cromwell
standing
amazed
why
how
now
cromwell
cromwell
i
have
no
power
to
speak

and
quiet
conscience

cur
me

humbly
thank
his
grace

from
these

load

sink
a
navy

right
use
of
it

fortitude

greater

than
my
enemies

sudden

he
a
learned
man
may
he
continue
long
in
his
highness
favour
and
do
justice
for
truth
sake
and
his
conscience
that
his
bones
when
he
has
run
his
course
and
sleeps
in
blessings

have
a
tomb
of
orphans
tears
wept

reach
a
chair
so
now
methinks
i
feel
a
little
ease
didst
thou
not
tell
me
griffith
as
thou
me
that
the
great
child
of
honour
cardinal
wolsey
was
dead
griffith
yes
madam
but
i
think
your
grace
out
of
the
pain
you
suffer
gave
no
ear
katharine
prithee
good
griffith
tell
me
how
he
died
if
well
he
stepp
before
me
happily
for
my
example
griffith
well
the
voice
goes
madam
for
after
the
stout
earl
northumberland
arrested
him
at
york
and
brought
him
forward
as
a
man
sorely
tainted
to
his
answer
he
fell
sick
suddenly
and
grew
so
ill
he
could
not
sit
his
mule
katharine
alas
poor
man
griffith
at
last
with
easy
roads
he
came
to
leicester
lodg
in
the
abbey
where
the
reverend
abbot
with
all
his
covent
honourably
receiv
him
to
whom
he
gave
these
words
father
abbot
an
old
man
broken
with
the
storms
of
state
is
come
to
lay
his
weary
bones
among
ye
give
him
a
little
earth
for
charity
so
went
to
bed
where
eagerly
his
sickness
pursu
him
still
and
three
nights
after
this
about
the
hour
of
eight
which
he
himself
foretold
should
be
his
last
full
of
repentance
continual
meditations
tears
and
sorrows
he
gave
his
honours
to
the
world
again
his
blessed
part
to
heaven
and
slept
in
peace
katharine
so
may
he
rest
his
faults
lie
gently
on
him
yet
thus
far
griffith
give
me
leave
to
speak
him
and
yet
with
charity
he
was
a
man
of
an
unbounded
stomach
ever
ranking
himself
with
princes
one
that
by
suggestion
tied
all
the
kingdom
simony
was
fair
play
his
own
opinion
was
his
law
i
th
presence
he
would
say
untruths
and
be
ever
double
both
in
his
words
and
meaning
he
was
never
but
where
he
meant
to
ruin
pitiful
his
promises
were
as
he
then
was
mighty
but
his
performance
as
he
is
now
nothing
of
his
own
body
he
was
ill
and
gave
the
clergy
ill
example
griffith
noble
madam
men
evil
manners
live
in
brass
their
virtues
we
write
in
water
may
it
please
your
highness
to
hear
me
speak
his
good
now
katharine
yes
good
griffith
i
were
malicious
else
griffith
this
cardinal
though
from
an
humble
stock
undoubtedly
was
fashion
to
much
honour
from
his
cradle
he
was
a
scholar
and
a
ripe
and
good
one
exceeding
wise
and
persuading
lofty
and
sour
to
them
that
lov
him
not
but
to
those
men
that
sought
him
sweet
as
summer
and
though
he
were
unsatisfied
in
getting
which
was
a
sin
yet
in
bestowing
madam
he
was
most
princely
ever
witness
for
him
those
twins
of
learning
that
he
rais
in
you
ipswich
and
oxford
one
of
which
fell
with
him
unwilling
to
outlive
the
good
that
did
it
the
other
though
unfinish
yet
so
famous
so
excellent
in
art
and
still
so
rising
that
christendom
shall
ever
speak
his
virtue
his
overthrow
heap
happiness
upon
him
for
then
and
not
till
then
he
felt
himself
and
found
the
blessedness
of
being
little
and
to
add
greater
honours
to
his
age
than
man
could
give
him
he
died
fearing
god
katharine
after
my
death
i
wish
no
other
herald
no
other
speaker
of
my
living
actions
to
keep
mine
honour
from
corruption
but
such
an
honest
chronicler
as
griffith
whom
i
most
hated
living
thou
hast
made
me
with
thy
religious
truth
and
modesty
now
in
his
ashes
honour
peace
be
with
him
patience
be
near
me
still
and
set
me
lower
i
have
not
long
to
trouble
thee
good
griffith
cause
the
musicians
play
me
that
sad
note
i
nam
my
knell
whilst
i
sit
meditating
on
that
celestial
harmony
i
go
to
sad
and
solemn
music
griffith
she
is
asleep
good
wench
let
sit
down
quiet
for
fear
we
wake
her
softly
gentle

the
vision

solemnly
tripping
one
after
another
six
personages
clad
in
white
robes
wearing
on
their
heads
garlands
of
bays
and
golden
vizards
on
their
faces
branches
of
bays
or
palm
in
their
hands
they
first
congee
unto
her
then
dance
and
at
certain
changes
the
first
two
hold
a
spare
garland
over
her
head
at
which
the
other
four
make
reverent
curtsies
then
the
two
that
held
the
garland
deliver
the
same
to
the
other
next
two
who
observe
the
same
order
in
their
changes
and
holding
the
garland
over
her
head
which
done
they
deliver
the
same
garland
to
the
last
two
who
likewise
observe
the
same
order
at
which
as
it
were
by
inspiration
she
makes
in
her
sleep
signs
of
rejoicing
and
holdeth
up
her
hands
to
heaven
and
so
in
their
dancing
vanish
carrying
the
garland
with
them
the
music
continues

which
frailty
and
want
of
wisdom
you
that
best
should
teach

have

so
we
are
inform
with
new
opinions
divers
and
dangerous
which
are
heresies
and
not
reform

prove
pernicious
gardiner
which
reformation
must
be
sudden
too
my
noble
lords
for
those
that
tame
wild
horses
pace
not
in
their
hands
to
make
gentle
but
stop
their
mouth
with
stubborn
bits
and
spur
till
they
obey
the
manage
if
we
suffer
out
of
our
easiness
and
childish
pity
to
one
man
honour
this
contagious
sickness
farewell
all
physic
and
what
follows
then
commotions
uproars

a
general
taint

freshly
pitied
in

cranmer
my
good
lords
hitherto
in
all
the
progress
both
of
my
life
and
office
i
have
labour
and
with
no
little
study
that
my
teaching
and
the
strong
course
of
my
authority
might
go
one
way
and
safely
and
the
end
was
ever
to
do
well
nor
is
there
living
i
speak
it
with
a
single
heart
my
lords
a
man
that
more
detests
more
stirs
against
both
in
his
private
conscience
and
his
place
defacers
of
a
public
peace
than
i
do
pray
heaven
the
king
may
never
find
a
heart
with
less
allegiance
in
it
men
that
make
envy
and
crooked
malice
nourishment
dare
bite
the
best
i
do
beseech
your
lordships
that
in
this
case
of
justice
my
accusers
be
what
they
will
may
stand
forth
face
to
face
and
freely
urge
against
me
suffolk
nay
my
lord
that
can
not
be
you
are
a
councillor
and
by
that
virtue
no
man
dare
accuse
you
gardiner
my
lord
because
we
have
business
of
more
moment
we
will
be
short
with
you
is
his
highness
pleasure
and
our
consent
for
better
trial
of
you

you
be
committed
to
the
tower
where
being
but
a
private
man
again
you
shall
know
many

accuse
you
boldly
more
than

you
are
provided
for
cranmer

winchester
i
thank
you

all
the
weight
ye
can
upon
my
patience
i
make
as
little
doubt
as
you
do
conscience
in
doing
daily
wrongs
i
could
say
more
but
reverence
to
your
calling
makes
me
modest
gardiner
my
lord
my
lord
you
are
a
sectary
that
the
plain
truth
your
painted
gloss
discovers
to
men
that
understand
you
words
and
weakness
cromwell
my
lord
of
winchester
a
little
by
your
good
favour
too
sharp
men
so
noble
however
faulty

for
what
they
have
been
is
a
cruelty
to
load
a
falling
man
gardiner
good
master
secretary
i
cry
your
honour

may
worst
of
all
this

know
you
for
a
favourer
of
this
new
sect
ye
are
not
sound
cromwell

you
were
half
so
honest

their
fears

bold
language

your
bold
life

lords

thus
for
you
my
lord

take
it
by
all
voices
that
forthwith

th
tower
a
prisoner
there
to
remain
till
the
king
further

there
no
other
way
of
mercy
but

tower

lords
gardiner

you
expect

strangely
troublesome

some
o
th
guard

ready
there

the
guard

i
go
like
a
traitor

him
and
see
him
safe
i
th
tower
cranmer
stay
good
my
lords
i
have
a
little
yet
to
say
look
there
my
lords
by
virtue
of
that
ring
i
take
my
cause
out
of
the
gripes
of
cruel
men
and
give
it
to
a
most
noble
judge
the
king
my
master
chamberlain
this
is
the
king
ring
surrey
is
no
counterfeit
suffolk
is
the
right
ring
by
i
told
ye
all
when
we
first
put
this
dangerous
stone
fall
upon
ourselves
norfolk
do
you
think
my
lords
the
king
will
suffer
but
the
little
finger
of
this
man
to
be
vex
chamberlain
is
now
too
certain
how
much
more
is
his
life
in
value
with
him
would
i
were
fairly
out
o
cromwell
my
mind
gave
me
in
seeking
tales
and
informations
against
this
man
whose
honesty
the
devil
and
his
disciples
only
envy
at
ye
blew
the
fire
that
burns
ye
now
have
at
ye
enter
the
king
frowning
on
them
he
takes
his
seat
gardiner
dread
sovereign
how
much
are
we
bound
to
heaven
in
daily
thanks
that
gave
us
such
a
prince
not
only
good
and
wise
but
most
religious
one
that
in
all
obedience
makes
the
church
the
chief
aim
of
his
honour
and
to
strengthen
that
holy
duty
out
of
dear
respect
his
royal
self
in
judgment
comes
to
hear
the
cause
betwixt
her
and
this
great
offender
king
you
were
ever
good
at
sudden
commendations
bishop
of
winchester
but
know
i
come
not
to
hear
such
flattery
now
and
in
my
presence
they
are
too
thin
and
bare
to
hide
offences
to
me
you
can
not
reach
you
play
the
spaniel
and
think
with
wagging
of
your
tongue
to
win
me
but
thou
me
for
i
sure
thou
hast
a
cruel
nature
and
a
bloody
to
cranmer
good
man
sit
down
now
let
me
see
the
proudest
he
that
dares
most
but
wag
his
finger
at
thee
by
all
that
holy
he
had
better
starve
than
but
once
think
this
place
becomes
thee
not
surrey
may
it
please
your
grace
king
no
sir
it
does
not
please
me
i
had
thought
i
had
had
men
of
some
understanding
and
wisdom
of
my
council
but
i
find
none
was
it
discretion
lords
to
let
this
man
this
good
man
few
of
you
deserve
that
title
this
honest
man
wait
like
a
lousy
footboy
at
chamber
door
and
one
as
great
as
you
are
why
what
a
shame
was
this
did
my
commission
bid
ye
so
far
forget
yourselves
i
gave
ye
power
as
he
was
a
councillor
to
try
him
not
as
a
groom
there
some
of
ye
i
see
more
out
of
malice
than
integrity
would
try
him
to
the
utmost
had
ye
mean
which
ye
shall
never
have
while
i
live
chancellor
thus
far
my
most
dread
sovereign
may
it
like
your
grace
to
let
my
tongue
excuse
all
what
was
concerning
his
imprisonment
was
rather
if
there
be
faith
in
men
meant
for
his
trial
and
fair
purgation
to
the
world
than
malice
i
sure
in
me
king
well
well
my
lords
respect
him
take
him
and
use
him
well
he
worthy
of
it
i
will
say
thus
much
for
him
if
a
prince
may
be
beholding
to
a
subject
am
for
his
love
and
service
so
to
him
make
me
no
more
ado
but
all
embrace
him
be
friends
for
shame
my
lords

lord
of
canterbury

suit

godfather
and

for
her
cranmer

greatest
monarch

alive

an

pink
porringer
fell

such
a
combustion

the
meteor

that
woman
who
cried
out
when

some
forty
truncheoners

a
of
pebbles
that

was
fain
to
draw
mine
honour
in

the
work

amongst

the
youths

promises
upon
this
land
a
thousand
blessings
which
time
shall
bring
to

she
shall
be
but
few
now
living
can
behold
that
goodness
a
pattern
to
all
princes
living
with
her
and
all
that

succeed
saba
was

covetous

up
such
a
mighty
piece

this
is
with
all
the

merry
songs

all
his
neighbours
god
shall
be
truly
known
and
those
about
her
from
her
shall
read
the
perfect
ways
of
honour
and
by
those
claim
their
greatness
not
by
blood
nor
shall
this
peace
sleep
with
her

as
when
the
bird
of
wonder
dies
the
maiden
phoenix
her
ashes
new
create
another
heir
as
great
in
admiration
as
herself

shall
she
leave
her
blessedness
to
one
when
heaven
shall
call
her
from
this
cloud
of
darkness
who
from
the
sacred
ashes
of
her
honour
shall
rise
as
great
in
fame

she
was

terror

the
bright
sun
of
heaven
shall
shine
his
honour
and
the
greatness
of
his
name
shall
be
and
make
new
nations

shall
flourish
and
like
a
mountain
cedar
reach
his
branches
to
all
the
plains
about
him
our
children
