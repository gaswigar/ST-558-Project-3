preface
edgar
allan
poe
has
been
the
subject
of
so
much
controversy
that
he
is
the
one
american
writer
whom
pupils
not
to
mention
teachers
are
likely
to
approach
with
prejudices
it
is
impossible
to
treat
such
a
subject
in
quite
the
ordinary
way
furthermore
his
writings
are
so
highly
subjective
and
so
intimately
connected
with
his
strongly
held
critical
theories
as
to
need
somewhat
careful
and
extended
study
these
facts
make
it
very
difficult
to
treat
either
the
man
or
his
art
as
simply
as
is
desirable
in
a
secondary
consequently
the
introduction
is
longer
and
less
simple
than
the
editor
would
desire
for
the
usual
text
it
is
believed
however
that
the
teacher
can
take
up
this
introduction
with
the
pupil
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
it
helpful
significant
and
interesting
the

edgar
allan
poe
his
life
character
and
art
edgar
allan
poe
is
in
many
respects
the
most
fascinating
figure
in
american
literature
his
life
touched
by
the
extremes
of
fortune
was
on
the
whole
more
unhappy
than
that
of
any
other
of
our
prominent
men
of
letters
his
character
was
strangely
complex
and
was
the
subject
of
misunderstanding
during
his
life
and
of
heated
dispute
after
his
death
his
writings
were
long
neglected
or
disparaged
at
home
while
accepted
abroad
as
our
greatest
literary
achievement
now
after
more
than
half
a
century
has
elapsed
since
his
death
careful
biographers
have
furnished
a
tolerably
full
account
of
the
real
facts
about
his
life
a
fairly
accurate
idea
of
his
character
is
winning
general
acceptance
and
the
name
of
edgar
allan
poe
has
been
conceded
a
place
among
the
two
or
three
greatest
in
our
literature
life
and
character
in
december
a
actress
of
the
time
died
in
richmond
leaving
destitute
three
little
children
the
eldest
but
four
years
of
age
this
mother
who
was
elizabeth
arnold
poe
daughter
of
an
english
actress
had
suffered
from
ill
health
for
several
years
and
had
long
found
the
struggle
for
existence
difficult
her
husband
david
poe
probably
died
before
her
he
was
a
son
of
general
david
poe
a
revolutionary
veteran
of
baltimore
and
had
left
his
home
and
law
books
for
the
stage
several
years
before
his
marriage
the
second
of
the
three
children
born
january
in
boston
where
his
parents
happened
to
be
playing
at
the
time
was
edgar
poe
the
future
poet
and
the
little
edgar
was
adopted
by
the
wife
of
john
allan
a
scotch
merchant
of
the
city
who
later
became
wealthy
and
the
boy
was
thereafter
known
as
edgar
allan
poe
he
was
a
beautiful
and
precocious
child
who
at
six
years
of
age
could
read
draw
dance
and
declaim
the
best
poetry
with
fine
effect
and
appreciation
report
says
also
that
he
had
been
taught
to
stand
on
a
chair
and
pledge
allan
guests
in
a
glass
of
wine
with
roguish
grace
in
allan
went
to
england
where
he
remained
five
years
edgar
was
placed
in
an
old
english
school
in
the
suburbs
of
london
among
historic
literary
and
antiquarian
associations
and
possibly
was
taken
to
the
continent
by
his
foster
parents
at
vacation
seasons
the
english
residence
and
the
sea
voyages
left
deep
impressions
on
the
boy
sensitive
nature
returning
to
richmond
he
was
prepared
in
good
schools
for
the
university
of
virginia
which
he
entered
at
the
age
of
seventeen
pursuing
studies
in
ancient
and
modern
languages
and
literatures
during
this
youthful
period
he
was
already
developing
a
striking
and
peculiar
personality
he
was
brilliant
if
not
industrious
as
a
student
leaving
the
university
with
highest
honors
in
latin
and
french
he
was
quick
and
nervous
in
his
movements
and
greatly
excelled
in
athletics
especially
in
swimming
in
character
he
was
reserved
solitary
sensitive
and
given
to
lonely
reverie
some
of
his
aristocratic
playmates
remembered
to
his
discredit
that
he
was
the
child
of
strolling
players
and
their
attitude
helped
to
add
a
strain
of
defiance
to
an
already
intensely
proud
nature
though
kindly
treated
by
his
foster
parents
this
strange
boy
longed
for
an
understanding
sympathy
that
was
not
his
once
he
thought
he
had
found
it
in
jane
stannard
mother
of
a
schoolmate
but
the
new
friend
soon
died
and
for
months
the
boy
it
is
said
haunted
the
lonely
grave
at
night
and
brooded
over
his
loss
and
the
mystery
of
death
a
not
very
wholesome
experience
for
a
lonely
and
melancholy
lad
of
fifteen
years
at
the
university
he
drank
wine
though
not
intemperately
and
played
cards
a
great
deal
the
end
of
the
term
finding
him
with
gambling
debts
of
hundred
dollars
these
habits
were
common
at
the
time
and
edgar
did
not
incur
any
censure
from
the
faculty
but
allan
declined
to
honor
the
gambling
debt
removed
edgar
and
placed
him
in
his
own
counting
room
such
a
life
was
too
dull
for
the
poetic
youth
and
he
promptly
left
his
home
going
to
boston
he
published
a
thin
volume
of
boyish
verse
tamerlane
and
other
poems
but
realizing
nothing
financially
he
enlisted
in
the
united
states
army
as
edgar
perry
after
two
years
of
faithful
and
efficient
service
he
procured
through
allan
who
was
temporarily
reconciled
to
him
an
appointment
to
the
west
point
military
academy
entering
in
july
in
the
meantime
he
had
published
in
baltimore
a
second
small
volume
of
poems
have
described
him
as
having
a
worn
weary
discontented
look
usually
kindly
and
courteous
but
shy
reserved
and
exceedingly
sensitive
an
extraordinary
reader
but
noted
for
carping
criticism
although
a
good
student
he
seemed
galled
beyond
endurance
by
the
monotonous
routine
of
military
duties
which
he
deliberately
neglected
and
thus
procured
his
dismissal
from
the
academy
he
left
alone
and
penniless
in
march
footnote
in
november
a
single
copy
of
this
little
volume
sold
in
new
york
for
going
to
new
york
poe
brought
out
another
little
volume
of
poems
showing
great
improvement
then
he
went
to
baltimore
and
after
a
precarious
struggle
of
a
year
or
two
turned
to
prose
and
while
in
great
poverty
won
a
prize
of
one
hundred
dollars
from
the
baltimore
for
his
story
the
manuscript
found
in
a
bottle
through
john
kennedy
one
of
the
judges
whose
friendship
the
author
gained
he
procured
a
good
deal
of
hack
work
and
finally
an
editorial
position
on
the
literary
of
richmond
the
salary
was
fair
and
better
was
in
sight
yet
poe
was
melancholy
dissatisfied
and
miserable
he
wrote
a
pitiable
letter
to
kennedy
asking
to
be
convinced
that
it
is
at
all
necessary
to
live

barn
rob
of
the
bowl
and
other
popular
novels
of
the
day
and
later
secretary
of
the
navy
for
several
years
he
had
been
making
his
home
with
an
aunt
clemm
and
her
daughter
virginia
a
girl
beautiful
in
character
and
person
but
penniless
and
probably
already
a
victim
of
the
consumption
that
was
eventually
to
cause
her
death
in
when
she
was
only
fourteen
years
old
poe
married
his
cousin
to
whom
he
was
passionately
attached
his
devotion
to
her
lasted
through
life
and
the
tenderest
affection
existed
between
him
and
clemm
who
was
all
a
mother
could
have
been
to
him
so
that
the
home
life
was
always
beautiful
in
spirit
however
poor
in
material
comfort
in
january
his
connection
with
the
was
severed
probably
because
of
his
occasional
lapses
from
sobriety
but
his
unfortunate
temperament
and
his
restless
ambition
were
doubtless
factors
with
some
reputation
as
poet
critic
and
editor
poe
removed
to
new
york
and
a
year
later
to
philadelphia
where
he
remained
until
here
he
found
miscellaneous
literary
editorial
and
hack
work
finally
becoming
editor
of
which
prospered
greatly
under
his
management
increasing
its
circulation
from
eight
thousand
to
forty
thousand
within
a
year
but
poe
restless
spirit
was
dissatisfied
he
was
intensely
anxious
to
own
a
magazine
for
himself
and
had
already
made
several
unsuccessful
efforts
to
obtain
one
efforts
which
were
to
be
repeated
at
intervals
and
with
as
little
success
until
the
day
his
death
he
vainly
sought
a
government
position
that
a
livelihood
might
be
assured
while
he
carried
out
his
literary
plans
finally
he
left
doubtless
because
of
personal
peculiarities
since
his
occasional
inebriety
did
not
interfere
with
his
work
and
there
followed
a
period
of
wretched
poverty
broken
once
by
the
winning
of
a
prize
of
one
hundred
dollars
for
the
gold
bug
he
continued
to
be
known
as
a
reserved
isolated
dreamy
man
of
nerves
proud
spirit
and
fantastic
moods
with
a
haunting
sense
of
impending
evil
his
home
was
poor
and
simple
but
impressed
every
visitor
by
its
neatness
and
quiet
refinement
virginia
accomplished
in
music
and
languages
was
as
devoted
to
her
husband
as
he
was
to
her
both
were
fond
of
flowers
and
plants
and
of
household
pets
clemm
gave
herself
completely
to
her
children
and
was
the
business
manager
of
the
family
in
the
spring
of
poe
went
with
virginia
to
new
york
practically
penniless
and
to
clemm
who
did
not
come
at
once
he
wrote
with
pathetic
enthusiasm
of
the
generous
meals
served
at
their
boarding
house
he
obtained
a
position
on
the
at
small
pay
but
did
his
dull
work
faithfully
and
efficiently
later
he
became
editor
of
the
in
which
he
printed
revisions
of
his
best
tales
and
poems
in
appeared
the
raven
which
created
a
profound
sensation
at
home
and
abroad
and
immediately
won
and
has
since
retained
an
immense
popularity
he
was
at
the
height
of
his
fame
but
poor
as
always
in
he
published
the
literati
critical
comments
on
the
writers
of
the
day
in
which
the
literary
small
fry
were
mercilessly
condemned
and
ridiculed
this
naturally
made
poe
a
host
of
enemies
one
of
these
thomas
dunn
english
published
an
abusive
article
attacking
the
character
whereupon
poe
sued
him
for
libel
and
obtained
two
hundred
and
dollars
damages
the
family
now
moved
to
a
little
cottage
at
fordham
a
quiet
country
place
with
flowers
and
trees
and
pleasant
vistas
but
illness
and
poverty
were
soon
there
too
in
virginia
had
burst
a
blood
vessel
while
singing
and
her
life
was
despaired
of
this
had
happened
again
and
again
leaving
her
weaker
each
time
as
the
summer
and
fall
of
this
year
wore
away
she
grew
worse
and
needed
the
tenderest
care
and
attention
but
winter
drew
on
and
with
it
came
cold
and
hunger
the
sick
girl
lay
in
an
unheated
room
on
a
straw
bed
wrapped
in
her
husband
coat
the
husband
and
mother
trying
to
chafe
a
little
warmth
into
her
hands
and
feet
some
women
relieved
the
distress
in
a
measure
but
on
january
virginia
died
the
effect
on
poe
was
terrible
it
is
easy
to
see
how
a
very
artist
of
death
who
could
study
the
dreadful
stages
of
its
slow
approach
and
seek
to
penetrate
the
mystery
of
its
ultimate
nature
with
such
intense
interest
and
deep
reflection
as
did
poe
must
have
brooded
and
suffered
during
the
years
of
his
wife
illness
his
own
health
had
long
been
poor
his
brain
was
diseased
and
insanity
seemed
imminent
after
intense
grief
came
a
period
of
settled
gloom
and
haunting
fear
the
less
than
three
years
of
life
left
for
him
was
a
period
of
decline
in
every
respect
but
he
remained
in
the
little
cottage
finding
some
comfort
in
caring
for
his
flowers
and
pets
and
taking
long
solitary
rambles
during
this
time
he
thought
out
and
wrote
eureka
a
treatise
on
the
structure
laws
and
destiny
of
the
universe
which
he
desired
to
have
regarded
as
a
poem
poe
had
always
felt
a
need
for
the
companionship
of
sympathetic
and
affectionate
women
for
whom
he
entertained
a
chivalric
regard
amounting
to
reverence
after
the
shock
of
his
wife
death
had
somewhat
worn
away
he
began
to
depend
for
sympathy
upon
various
women
with
whom
he
maintained
romantic
friendships
judged
by
ordinary
standards
his
conduct
became
at
times
little
short
of
maudlin
his
correspondence
showed
a
sort
of
gasping
frantic
dependence
upon
the
sympathy
and
consolation
of
these
women
friends
and
exhibited
a
painful
picture
of
a
broken
man
shew
one
of
the
kind
women
who
had
relieved
the
family
at
the
time
of
virginia
last
illness
strongly
advised
him
to
marry
and
he
did
propose
marriage
to
sara
helen
whitman
a
verse
writer
of
some
note
in
her
day
after
a
wild
and
exhausting
wooing
begun
in
an
extravagantly
romantic
manner
the
match
was
broken
off
through
the
influence
of
the
friends
when
it
was
all
over
poe
seemed
very
little
disturbed
the
truth
is
he
was
a
wreck
and
feeling
utterly
dependent
clutched
frantically
at
every
hope
of
sympathy
and
consolation
his
only
real
love
was
for
his
dead
wife
which
he
recorded
shortly
before
his
death
in
the
exquisite
lyric
annabel
lee
in
july
full
of
the
darkest
forebodings
and
predicting
that
he
should
never
return
poe
went
to
richmond
here
he
spent
a
few
quiet
months
part
of
the
time
fairly
cheerful
but
twice
yielding
to
the
temptation
to
drink
and
each
time
suffering
in
consequence
a
dangerous
illness
on
september
he
left
richmond
for
new
york
with
fifteen
hundred
dollars
the
product
of
a
recent
lecture
arranged
by
kind
richmond
friends
what
happened
during
the
next
three
days
is
an
impenetrable
mystery
but
on
october
wednesday
he
was
found
in
an
election
booth
in
baltimore
desperately
ill
his
money
and
baggage
gone
the
most
probable
story
is
that
he
had
been
drugged
by
political
workers
imprisoned
in
a
coop
with
similar
victims
and
used
as
a
repeater
this
procedure
being
a
common
one
at
the
time
whether
he
was
also
intoxicated
is
a
matter
of
doubt
there
could
be
but
one
effect
on
his
delicate
and
already
diseased
brain
he
was
taken
to
a
hospital
unconscious
lingered
several
days
in
the
delirium
of
a
violent
brain
fever
and
in
the
early
dawn
of
sunday
october
breathed
his
last
footnote
repeater
a
person
who
illegally
votes
more
than
once
the
dead
author
character
immediately
became
the
subject
of
violent
controversy
his
severe
critical
strictures
had
made
him
many
enemies
among
the
minor
writers
of
the
day
and
their
friends
one
of
the
men
who
had
suffered
from
poe
too
caustic
pen
was
rufus
griswold
but
friendly
relations
had
been
nominally
established
and
poe
had
authorized
griswold
to
edit
his
works
this
griswold
did
including
a
biography
which
poe
friends
declared
a
masterpiece
of
malicious
distortion
and
misrepresentation
it
certainly
was
grossly
unfair
and
inaccurate
poe
friends
retorted
and
a
long
war
of
words
followed
in
which
hatred
or
prejudice
on
the
one
side
and
wholesale
undiscriminating
laudation
on
the
other
alike
tended
to
obscure
the
truth
it
is
now
almost
impossible
to
see
the
real
poe
just
as
he
appeared
to
an
ordinary
unprejudiced
observer
of
his
own
time
only
by
the
most
careful
thoughtful
and
sympathetic
study
can
we
hope
to
approximate
such
an
acquaintance
the
fundamental
fact
about
poe
is
a
very
peculiar
and
unhappy
temperament
certain
characteristic
qualities
of
which
began
to
disclose
themselves
in
early
boyhood
and
fostered
by
the
vicissitudes
of
his
career
developed
throughout
his
life
in
youth
he
was
nervous
sensitive
morbid
proud
solitary
and
wayward
and
as
the
years
went
by
bringing
poverty
illness
and
the
bitterness
of
failure
often
through
his
own
faults
the
man
became
irritable
impatient
often
morose
he
had
always
suffered
from
fits
of
depression
blue
devils
kennedy
called
them
and
though
he
was
extravagantly
sanguine
at
times
melancholy
was
his
usual
mood
often
manifesting
itself
in
a
haunting
fear
of
evil
to
come
the
peculiar
character
of
his
wonderful
imagination
made
actual
life
less
real
to
him
than
his
own
land
of
dreams
the
distant
aidenn
the
dim
lake
of
auber
the
kingdom
by
the
sea
seemed
more
genuine
than
the
landscapes
of
earth
the
lurid
city
in
the
sea
more
substantial
than
the
streets
he
daily
walked
because
of
this
intensely
subjective
and
character
of
mind
he
had
no
understanding
of
human
nature
no
insight
into
character
with
its
marvelous
complexities
and
contradictions
with
these
limitations
poe
as
might
be
expected
had
a
very
defective
sense
of
humor
lacked
true
sympathy
was
tactless
possessed
little
business
ability
and
was
excessively
annoyed
by
the
dull
routine
and
rude
frictions
of
ordinary
life
he
was
always
touched
by
kindness
but
was
quick
to
resent
an
injury
and
even
as
a
boy
could
not
endure
a
jest
at
his
expense
he
had
many
warm
and
devoted
friends
whom
he
loved
in
return
but
the
limitations
of
his
own
nature
probably
made
a
really
frank
unreserved
friendship
impossible
and
when
a
break
occurred
he
was
apt
to
assume
that
his
former
friend
was
an
utter
villain
these
personal
characteristics
in
conjunction
with
a
goading
ambition
which
took
form
in
the
idea
of
an
independent
journal
of
his
own
in
which
he
might
find
untrammeled
expression
added
uneasiness
and
restlessness
to
a
constantly
discontented
nature
to
some
extent
at
least
poe
realized
the
curse
of
such
a
temperament
but
he
strove
vainly
against
its
impulses
the
one
genuine
human
happiness
of
this
sad
life
was
found
in
a
singularly
beautiful
home
atmosphere
husband
and
wife
were
passionately
devoted
to
each
other
and
clemm
was
more
than
a
mother
to
both
she
says
of
her
at
home
he
was
simple
and
affectionate
as
a
child
and
during
all
the
years
he
lived
with
me
i
do
not
remember
a
single
night
that
he
failed
to
come
and
kiss
his
as
he
called
me
before
going
to
bed
this
faithful
woman
remained
devoted
to
him
after
virginia
death
and
to
his
memory
when
calumny
assailed
it
after
his
own
the
capital
charge
against
poe
character
has
been
intemperance
and
although
the
matter
has
been
grossly
exaggerated
and
misrepresented
the
charge
is
true
except
for
short
periods
he
was
never
what
is
known
as
dissipated
and
he
struggled
desperately
against
his
weakness
an
unequal
struggle
since
the
craving
was
inherited
and
fostered
by
environment
circumstances
and
temperament
one
of
his
biographers
tells
of
bread
soaked
in
gin
being
fed
to
the
little
poe
children
by
an
old
nurse
during
the
illness
of
their
mother
and
there
is
another
story
already
mentioned
of
the
little
edgar
in
his
adoptive
home
taught
to
pledge
the
guests
as
a
social
grace
drinking
was
common
at
the
time
wine
was
offered
in
every
home
and
at
every
social
function
and
in
the
south
where
poe
spent
his
youth
and
early
manhood
the
spirit
of
hospitality
and
conviviality
held
out
constant
temptation
to
his
delicate
organization
strong
drink
early
became
a
veritable
poison
and
indulgence
that
would
have
been
a
small
matter
to
another
man
was
ruinous
to
him
indeed
a
single
glass
of
wine
drove
him
practically
insane
and
a
debauch
was
sure
to
follow
indulgence
was
stimulated
also
by
the
nervous
strain
and
worry
induced
by
uncertain
livelihood
and
privation
the
frequent
fits
of
depression
and
by
constant
brooding
sometimes
he
fought
his
weakness
successfully
for
several
years
but
always
it
conquered
in
the
end
moreover
he
speaks
of
a
very
special
cause
in
the
latter
part
of
his
life
which
in
fairness
should
be
heard
in
his
own
written
words
to
a
friend
six
years
ago
a
wife
whom
i
loved
as
no
man
ever
loved
before
ruptured
a
blood
vessel
in
singing
her
life
was
despaired
of
i
took
leave
of
her
forever
and
underwent
all
the
agonies
of
her
death
she
recovered
partially
and
i
again
hoped
at
the
end
of
a
year
the
vessel
broke
again
i
went
through
precisely
the
same
scene
then
again
again
and
even
once
again
at
varying
intervals
each
time
i
felt
all
the
agonies
of
her
death
and
at
each
accession
of
her
disorder
i
loved
her
more
dearly
and
clung
to
her
life
with
more
desperate
pertinacity
but
i
am
constitutionally
sensitive
nervous
in
a
very
unusual
degree
i
became
insane
with
long
intervals
of
horrible
sanity
during
these
fits
of
absolute
unconsciousness
i
drank
god
only
knows
how
often
or
how
much
as
a
matter
of
course
my
enemies
referred
the
insanity
to
the
drink
rather
than
the
drink
to
the
insanity
it
was
the
horrible
oscillation
between
hope
and
despair
which
i
could
longer
have
endured
without
total
loss
of
reason
in
the
death
of
what
was
my
life
then
i
received
a
new
but
o
god
how
melancholy
an
existence
this
statement
and
the
other
facts
mentioned
are
not
offered
as
wholly
excusing
poe
doubtless
a
stronger
man
would
have
resisted
doubtless
a
less
man
would
have
thought
of
his
happiness
as
well
as
of
his
own
relief
from
torture
yet
the
person
familiar
with
poe
unhappy
life
and
keeping
in
mind
the
influences
of
heredity
temperament
and
environment
will
hesitate
to
pronounce
a
severe
judgment
poe
was
also
accused
of
untruthfulness
and
this
accusation
likewise
has
a
basis
of
fact
he
repeatedly
furnished
or
approved
statements
regarding
his
life
and
work
that
were
incorrect
he
often
made
a
disingenuous
show
of
pretended
learning
and
he
sometimes
misstated
facts
to
avoid
wounding
his
own
vanity
this
ugly
fault
seems
to
have
resulted
from
a
fondness
for
romantic
posing
and
is
doubtless
related
to
the
peculiar
character
of
imagination
already
mentioned
perhaps
too
he
inherited
from
his
actor
parents
a
love
of
applause
and
if
so
the
trait
was
certainly
encouraged
in
early
childhood
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
was
ever
guilty
of
malicious
or
mercenary
falsehood
another
of
his
bad
habits
was
borrowing
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
his
life
was
one
long
struggle
with
grinding
poverty
that
he
and
those
dear
to
him
sometimes
suffered
actual
hunger
and
cold
many
who
knew
him
testified
to
his
anxiety
to
pay
all
his
debts
graham
referring
to
him
in
this
particular
as
the
soul
of
honor
in
a
letter
to
lowell
poe
has
well
described
himself
in
a
sentence
my
life
has
been
whim
impulse
passion
a
longing
for
solitude
a
scorn
of
all
things
present
in
an
earnest
desire
for
the
future
interpreted
this
means
that
in
a
sense
he
never
really
reached
maturity
that
he
remained
a
slave
to
his
impulses
and
emotions
that
he
detested
the
ordinary
business
of
life
and
could
not
adapt
himself
to
it
that
his
mind
was
full
of
dreams
of
ideal
beauty
and
perfection
that
his
whole
soul
yearned
to
attain
the
highest
pleasures
of
artistic
creation
his
was
perpetually
a
deeply
agitated
soul
as
such
it
was
natural
he
should
outwardly
seem
irritable
impatient
restless
discontented
and
solitary
it
is
impossible
to
believe
that
there
was
any
strain
of
real
evil
in
poe
a
man
who
could
inspire
such
devotion
as
he
had
from
such
a
woman
as
clemm
a
man
who
loved
flowers
and
children
and
animal
pets
who
could
be
so
devoted
a
husband
who
could
so
consecrate
himself
to
art
was
not
a
bad
man
yet
his
acts
were
often
as
we
have
seen
most
reprehensible
frequently
the
subject
of
slander
he
was
not
a
victim
of
conspiracy
to
defame
although
circumstances
were
many
times
against
him
he
was
his
own
worst
enemy
he
was
cursed
with
a
temperament
his
mind
was
analytical
and
imaginative
and
gave
no
thought
to
the
ethical
he
remained
wayward
as
a
child
the
man
like
his
art
was
not
immoral
but
simply
unmoral
whatever
his
faults
he
suffered
frightfully
for
them
and
his
fame
suffered
after
him
literary
work
poe
first
literary
ventures
were
in
verse
the
early
volumes
showing
strongly
the
influence
of
byron
and
moore
were
productions
of
small
merit
but
large
promise
their
author
was
soon
to
become
one
of
the
most
original
of
poets
his
later
work
being
unique
with
a
strangely
individual
poe
atmosphere
that
no
other
writer
has
ever
been
able
successfully
to
imitate
his
verse
is
individual
in
theme
treatment
and
structure
all
of
which
harmonize
with
his
conscious
theory
of
poetic
art
his
theory
is
briefly
this
it
is
not
the
function
of
poetry
to
teach
either
truth
or
morals
but
to
gratify
through
novel
forms
the
thirst
for
supernal
beauty
its
proper
effect
is
to
excite
by
elevating
the
soul
the
highest
beauty
has
always
some
admixture
of
sadness
the
most
poetical
of
all
themes
being
the
death
of
a
beautiful
woman
moreover
the
pleasure
derived
from
the
contemplation
of
this
higher
beauty
should
be
indefinite
that
is
true
poetic
feeling
is
not
the
result
of
coherent
narrative
or
clear
pictures
or
fine
moral
sentiment
but
consists
in
vague
exalted
emotion
music
of
all
the
arts
produces
the
vaguest
and
most
indefinite
pleasure
consequently
verse
forms
should
be
chosen
with
the
greatest
possible
attention
to
musical
effect
poetry
must
be
purely
a
matter
of
feeling
its
sole
arbiter
is
taste
with
the
intellect
or
with
the
conscience
it
has
only
collateral
relations
this
explanation
is
necessary
because
the
stock
criticism
of
poetry
condemns
it
as
vague
indefinite
and
devoid
of
thought
or
ethical
content
these
are
precisely
its
limitations
but
hardly
its
faults
since
the
poet
attained
with
marvelous
art
the
very
effects
he
desired
the
themes
of
nearly
all
the
poems
are
death
ruin
regret
or
failure
the
verse
is
original
in
form
and
among
the
most
musical
in
the
language
full
of
a
haunting
almost
magical
melody
mystery
symbolism
shadowy
suggestion
fugitive
thought
elusive
beauty
beings
that
are
mere
insubstantial
abstractions
these
are
the
characteristics
but
designedly
so
of
poe
poetry
a
poem
to
him
was
simply
a
crystallized
mood
and
it
is
futile
for
his
readers
to
apply
any
other
test
yet
the
influence
of
this
verse
has
been
wide
and
important
extending
to
most
lyric
poets
of
the
last
including
such
masters
as
rossetti
and
swinburne
to
helen
a
poem
of
three
brief
stanzas
is
poe
first
really
notable
production
it
is
an
exquisite
tribute
of
his
reverent
devotion
to
his
boyhood
friend
stannard
portraying
her
as
a
classic
embodiment
of
beauty
israfel
is
a
lyric
of
aspiration
of
rare
power
and
rapture
worthy
of
shelley
and
is
withal
the
most
spontaneous
simple
and
genuinely
human
poem
poe
ever
wrote
the
haunted
palace
one
of
the
finest
of
his
poems
is
an
unequaled
allegory
of
the
wreck
and
ruin
of
sovereign
reason
which
to
be
fully
appreciated
should
be
read
in
its
somber
setting
the
fall
of
the
house
of
usher
less
attractive
is
the
conqueror
worm
with
its
repulsive
imagery
but
this
tragedy
with
the
universe
as
a
theater
moving
to
the
music
of
the
spheres
and
horror
the
soul
of
the
plot
is
undeniably
powerful
and
intensely
terrible
the
raven
published
in
attained
immediately
a
celebrity
and
rivals
in
fame
and
popularity
any
lyric
ever
written
it
is
the
most
elaborate
treatment
of
poe
favorite
theme
the
death
of
a
beautiful
woman
the
reveries
of
a
bereaved
lover
alone
in
his
library
at
midnight
in
the
bleak
december
vainly
seeking
to
forget
his
sorrow
for
the
lost
lenore
are
interrupted
by
a
tapping
as
of
some
one
desirous
to
enter
after
a
time
he
admits
a
stately
raven
and
seeks
to
beguile
his
sad
fancy
by
putting
questions
to
the
bird
whose
one
reply
is
nevermore
and
this
constitutes
the
refrain
of
the
poem
impelled
by
an
instinct
of
the
lover
asks
whether
he
shall
have
respite
from
the
painful
memories
of
lenore
here
or
hereafter
and
finally
whether
in
the
distant
aidenn
he
and
his
love
shall
be
reunited
to
all
of
which
the
raven
returns
his
one
answer
driven
to
frenzy
the
lover
implores
the
bird
take
thy
beak
from
out
my
heart
and
take
thy
form
from
off
my
door
only
to
learn
that
the
shadow
will
be
lifted
nevermore
the
raven
is
in
the
poet
own
words
emblematical
of
mournful
and
remembrance
ulalume
has
been
commonly
though
not
always
regarded
as
a
mere
experiment
in
verbal
ingenuity
meaningless
melody
or
the
insanity
of
versification
as
a
distinguished
american
critic
has
called
it
such
a
judgment
is
a
mark
of
inability
to
understand
poe
most
characteristic
work
for
in
truth
ulalume
is
the
extreme
expression
at
once
of
his
critical
theory
and
of
his
peculiar
genius
as
a
poet
it
was
published
in
december
of
the
same
year
in
which
virginia
died
in
january
the
poet
condition
has
already
been
described
ulalume
is
a
marvelous
expression
of
his
mood
at
this
time
it
depicts
a
soul
worn
out
by
long
suffering
groping
for
courage
and
hope
only
to
return
again
to
the
door
of
a
legended
tomb
it
is
true
the
movement
is
slow
impeded
by
the
frequent
repetitions
but
so
the
wearied
mind
after
nervous
exhaustion
is
palsied
and
sere
there
is
no
appeal
to
the
intellect
but
this
is
characteristic
of
poe
and
appropriate
to
a
mind
numbed
by
protracted
suffering
it
is
this
mood
of
wearied
benumbed
discouraged
hopeless
hope
feebly
seeking
for
the
lethean
peace
of
the
skies
only
to
find
the
mind
inevitably
reverting
to
the
lost
ulalume
that
finds
expression
there
is
no
definite
thought
because
only
the
communication
of
feeling
is
intended
there
is
no
distinct
setting
because
the
whole
action
is
spiritual
the
dim
lake
and
dark
tarn
of
auber
the
woodland
of
weir
the
alley
titanic
of
cypress
are
the
and
places
of
the
poet
own
darkened
mind
while
the
ashen
skies
of
the
lonesome
october
are
significant
enough
of
this
most
immemorial
year
the
poem
is
a
monody
of
nerveless
exhausted
grief
as
such
it
must
be
read
to
be
appreciated
as
such
it
must
be
judged
and
so
appreciated
and
so
judged
it
is
absolutely
unique
and
incomparable
about
a
year
later
came
the
bells
wonderful
for
the
music
of
its
verse
and
the
finest
onomatopoetic
poem
in
the
language
two
days
after
poe
death
appeared
annabel
lee
a
simple
sincere
and
beautiful
ballad
a
tribute
to
his
dead
wife
last
of
all
was
printed
the
brief
eldorado
a
fitting
for
poe
in
which
a
gallant
knight
sets
out
singing
a
song
in
search
of
eldorado
only
to
learn
when
youth
and
strength
are
gone
that
he
must
seek
his
goal
down
the
valley
of
the
shadow
the
tales
like
the
poems
are
a
real
contribution
to
the
literature
but
more
strikingly
so
since
the
type
itself
is
original
poe
hawthorne
and
irving
are
distinctly
the
pioneers
in
the
production
of
the
modern
short
story
and
neither
has
been
surpassed
on
his
own
ground
but
poe
has
been
vastly
the
greater
influence
in
foreign
countries
especially
in
france
poe
formed
a
new
conception
of
the
short
story
one
which
professor
brander
matthews
has
treated
formally
and
explicitly
as
a
distinct
literary
form
different
from
the
story
that
is
merely
short
without
calling
it
a
distinct
form
poe
implied
the
idea
in
a
review
of
tales
footnote
the
philosophy
of
the
chapter
iv
of
pen
and
ink
the
ordinary
novel
is
objectionable
from
its
length
as
it
can
not
be
read
at
one
sitting
it
deprives
itself
of
course
of
the
immense
force
derivable
from
in
the
brief
tale
however
the
author
is
enabled
to
carry
out
the
fulness
of
his
intention
be
it
what
it
may
during
the
hour
of
perusal
the
soul
of
the
reader
is
at
the
writer
control
a
skillful
literary
artist
has
constructed
a
tale
if
wise
he
has
not
fashioned
his
thoughts
to
accommodate
his
incidents
but
having
conceived
with
deliberate
care
a
certain
unique
or
single
to
be
wrought
out
he
then
invents
such
incidents
he
then
combines
such
events
as
may
best
aid
him
in
establishing
this
preconceived
effect
if
his
very
initial
sentence
tend
not
to
the
of
this
effect
then
he
has
failed
in
his
first
step
in
the
whole
composition
there
should
be
no
word
written
of
which
the
tendency
direct
or
indirect
is
not
to
the
one
preëstablished
design
this
idea
of
a
short
story
should
be
kept
in
mind
in
reading
works
for
he
applied
his
theory
perfectly
the
stories
are
of
greater
variety
than
the
poems
there
are
romances
of
death
whose
themes
are
fear
horror
madness
catalepsy
premature
burial
torture
mesmerism
and
revengeful
cruelty
tales
of
weird
beauty
allegories
of
conscience
narratives
of
stories
of
analytical
reasoning
descriptions
of
beautiful
landscapes
and
what
are
usually
termed
prose
poems
he
also
wrote
tales
grotesque
humorous
and
satirical
most
of
which
are
failures
the
earlier
tales
are
predominantly
imaginative
and
emotional
most
of
the
later
ones
are
predominantly
intellectual
none
of
the
tales
touches
ordinary
healthy
life
there
is
scarcely
a
suggestion
of
local
color
the
humor
is
nearly
always
mechanical
there
is
little
conversation
and
the
characters
are
never
normal
human
beings
although
the
stories
are
strongly
romantic
in
subject
plot
and
setting
there
is
an
extraordinary
realism
in
treatment
a
minuteness
and
accuracy
of
detail
equaling
the
work
of
defoe
this
is
one
secret
of
the
magical
art
that
not
only
transports
us
to
the
world
of
dream
and
vision
where
the
author
own
soul
roamed
but
for
the
time
makes
it
all
real
to
us
poe
finest
tale
as
a
work
of
art
is
the
fall
of
the
house
of
usher
which
is
as
nearly
perfect
in
its
craftsmanship
as
human
work
may
be
it
is
a
romance
of
death
with
a
setting
of
profound
gloom
and
is
wrought
out
as
a
highly
imaginative
study
in
fear
a
symphony
in
which
every
touch
blends
into
a
perfect
unity
of
effect
ligeia
perhaps
standing
next
incorporating
the
conqueror
worm
as
its
keynote
portrays
the
terrific
struggle
of
a
woman
will
against
death
the
masque
of
the
red
death
a
tale
of
the
spirit
of
pestilence
and
of
death
victorious
over
human
selfishness
and
power
is
a
splendid
study
in
somber
color
the
assignation
a
romance
of
venice
is
also
splendid
in
coloring
and
rich
in
decorative
effects
presenting
a
luxury
of
sorrow
culminating
in
romantic
suicide
william
wilson
is
an
allegory
of
conscience
personified
in
a
double
the
forerunner
of
stevenson
jekyll
and
mr
hyde
other
conscience
stories
are
the
man
of
the
crowd
the
heart
also
depicting
insanity
and
the
black
cat
of
which
the
atmosphere
is
horror
the
adventures
of
one
hans
pfaal
and
the
balloon
hoax
are
examples
of
the
tales
which
attain
their
verisimilitude
by
diverting
attention
from
the
improbability
or
impossibility
of
the
general
incidents
to
the
accuracy
and
naturalness
of
details
in
the
descent
into
the
maëlstrom
scientific
reasoning
is
skillfully
blended
with
imaginative
strength
poetic
description
and
stirring
adventure
this
type
of
story
is
clearly
enough
the
original
of
those
of
jules
verne
and
similar
writers
the
murders
in
the
rue
morgue
and
the
purloined
letter
are
the
pioneer
detective
stories
dupin
the
original
sherlock
holmes
and
they
remain
the
best
of
their
kind
unsurpassed
in
originality
ingenuity
and
plausibility
another
type
of
the
story
of
analytical
reasoning
is
the
built
around
the
solution
of
a
cryptogram
but
also
introducing
an
element
of
adventure
poe
analytical
power
was
real
not
a
trick
if
he
made
legrand
solve
the
cryptogram
and
boast
his
ability
to
solve
others
more
difficult
poe
himself
solved
scores
sent
him
in
response
to
a
public
magazine
challenge
if
dupin
solved
mysteries
that
poe
invented
for
him
poe
himself
wrote
in
marie
roget
from
newspaper
accounts
the
solution
of
a
real
murder
mystery
and
astounded
dickens
by
outlining
the
entire
plot
of
barnaby
rudge
when
only
a
few
of
the
first
chapters
had
been
published
if
he
wrote
imaginatively
of
science
he
in
fact
demonstrated
in
maelzel
chess
player
that
a
pretended
automaton
was
operated
by
a
man
hop
frog
and
the
cask
of
amontillado
are
stories
of
revenge
the
island
of
the
fay
and
the
domain
of
arnheim
are
landscape
studies
the
one
of
calm
loveliness
the
other
of
oriental
profusion
and
coloring
shadow
and
silence
are
commonly
classed
as
prose
poems
the
former
being
one
of
poe
most
effective
productions
eleonora
besides
having
a
story
to
tell
is
both
a
prose
poem
and
a
landscape
study
and
withal
one
of
poe
most
exquisite
writings
although
poe
was
not
a
great
critic
his
critical
work
is
by
no
means
valueless
he
applied
for
the
first
time
in
america
a
thoroughgoing
scrutiny
and
able
fearless
criticism
to
contemporary
literature
undoubtedly
with
good
effect
his
attacks
on
didacticism
were
especially
valuable
his
strength
as
a
critic
lay
in
his
artistic
temperament
and
in
the
incisive
intellect
that
enabled
him
to
analyze
the
effects
produced
in
his
own
creations
and
in
those
of
others
his
weaknesses
were
extravagance
a
mania
for
harping
on
plagiarism
lack
of
spiritual
insight
broad
sympathies
and
profound
scholarship
and
in
general
the
narrow
range
of
his
genius
which
has
already
been
made
sufficiently
clear
his
severity
has
been
exaggerated
as
he
often
praised
highly
probably
erring
more
frequently
by
undue
laudation
than
by
extreme
severity
though
personal
prejudice
sometimes
crept
into
his
work
especially
in
favor
of
women
yet
on
the
whole
he
was
as
fair
and
fearless
as
he
claimed
to
be
much
of
the
hasty
journalistic
hack
work
is
valueless
as
might
be
expected
but
he
wrote
very
suggestively
of
his
art
and
nearly
all
his
judgments
have
been
sustained
moreover
he
met
one
supreme
test
of
a
critic
in
recognizing
unknown
genius
dickens
he
was
among
the
first
to
appraise
as
a
great
novelist
tennyson
and
elizabeth
barrett
browning
he
ranked
among
the
great
poets
without
hesitation
and
at
home
he
early
expressed
a
due
appreciation
of
hawthorne
lowell
longfellow
and
bryant
poe
place
both
in
prose
and
poetry
is
assured
his
recognition
abroad
has
been
clear
and
emphatic
from
the
first
especially
in
france
and
foreigners
generally
regard
him
as
the
greatest
writer
we
have
produced
an
opinion
in
which
a
number
of
our
own
critics
and
readers
concur
one
judgment
in
the
matter
will
depend
upon
the
point
of
view
and
the
standards
adopted
it
is
too
large
a
subject
to
consider
here
but
if
artistic
craftsmanship
be
the
standard
certainly
hawthorne
would
be
his
only
rival
and
hawthorne
was
not
also
a
poet
the
question
of
exact
relative
rank
however
it
is
neither
possible
nor
important
to
settle
it
is
sufficient
to
say
in
the
words
of
professor
woodberry
on
the
roll
of
our
literature
poe
name
is
inscribed
among
the
few
foremost
and
in
the
world
at
large
his
genius
is
established
as
valid
among
all
men

there
was

painted

hyacinth
hair
thy
classic
face
thy
naiad
airs
have
brought
me
home
to
the
glory
that
was
greece
and
the
grandeur
that
was
rome
lo
in
yon
brilliant
how
i
see
thee
stand
the
agate
lamp
within
thy
hand
ah
psyche
from
the
regions
which
are
holy
land
israfel
and
the
angel
israfel
whose
are
a
lute
and
who
has
the
sweetest
voice
of
all
god
koran
in
heaven
a
spirit
doth
dwell
whose
are
a
lute
none
sing
so
wildly
well
as
the
angel
israfel
and
the
giddy
stars
so
legends
tell
ceasing
their
hymns
attend
the
spell
of
his
voice
all
mute
tottering
above
in
her
highest
noon
the
enamoured
moon
blushes
with
love
while
to
listen
the
red
levin
with
the
rapid
pleiads
even
which
were
seven
pauses
in
heaven
and
they
say
the
starry
choir
and
the
other
listening
things
that
israfeli
fire
is
owing
to
that
lyre
by
which
he
sits
and
sings
the
trembling
living
wire
of
those
unusual
strings
but
the
skies
that
angel
trod
where
deep
thoughts
are
a
duty
where
love
a
god
where
the
houri
glances
are
imbued
with
all
the
beauty
which
we
worship
in
a
star
therefore
thou
art
not
wrong
israfeli
who
despisest
an
unimpassioned
song
to
thee
the
laurels
belong
best
bard
because
the
wisest
merrily
live
and
long
the
ecstasies
above
with
thy
burning
measures
suit
thy
grief
thy
joy
thy
hate
thy
love
with
the
fervor
of
thy
lute
well
may
the
stars
be
mute
yes
heaven
is
thine
but
this
is
a
world
of
sweets
and
sours
our
flowers
are
merely
flowers
and
the
shadow
of
thy
perfect
bliss
is
the
sunshine
of
ours
if
i
could
dwell
where
israfel
hath
dwelt
and
he
where
i
he
might
not
sing
so
wildly
well
a
mortal
melody
while
a
bolder
note
than
this
might
swell
from
my
lyre
within
the
sky
the
city
in
the
sea
lo
death
has
reared
himself
a
throne
in
a
strange
city
lying
alone
far
down
within
the
dim
west
where
the
good
and
the
bad
and
the
worst
and
the
best
have
gone
to
their
eternal
rest
there
shrines
and
palaces
and
towers
towers
that
tremble
not
resemble
nothing
that
is
ours
around
by
lifting
winds
forgot
resignedly
beneath
the
sky
the
melancholy
waters
lie
no
rays
from
the
holy
heaven
come
down
on
the
long
of
that
town
but
light
from
out
the
lurid
sea
streams
up
the
turrets
silently
gleams
up
the
pinnacles
far
and
free
up
domes
up
spires
up
kingly
halls
up
fanes
up
walls
up
shadowy
bowers
of
sculptured
ivy
and
stone
flowers
up
many
and
many
a
marvellous
shrine
whose
wreathed
friezes
intertwine
the
viol
the
violet
and
the
vine
resignedly
beneath
the
sky
the
melancholy
waters
lie
so
blend
the
turrets
and
shadows
there
that
all
seem
pendulous
in
air
while
from
a
proud
tower
in
the
town
death
looks
gigantically
down
there
open
fanes
and
gaping
graves
yawn
level
with
the
luminous
waves
but
not
the
riches
there
that
lie
in
each
idol
diamond
eye
not
the
dead
tempt
the
waters
from
their
bed
for
no
ripples
curl
alas
along
that
wilderness
of
glass
no
swellings
tell
that
winds
may
be
upon
some
happier
sea
no
heavings
hint
that
winds
have
been
on
seas
less
hideously
serene
but
lo
a
stir
is
in
the
air
the
wave
there
is
a
movement
there
as
if
the
towers
had
thrust
aside
in
slightly
sinking
the
dull
tide
as
if
their
tops
had
feebly
given
a
void
within
the
filmy
heaven
the
waves
have
now
a
redder
glow
the
hours
are
breathing
faint
and
low
and
when
amid
no
earthly
moans
down
down
that
town
shall
settle
hence
hell
rising
from
a
thousand
thrones
shall
do
it
reverence
the
sleeper
at
midnight
in
the
month
of
june
i
stand
beneath
the
mystic
moon
an
opiate
vapor
dewy
dim
exhales
from
out
her
golden
rim
and
softly
dripping
drop
by
drop
upon
the
quiet
steals
drowsily
and
musically
into
the
universal
valley
the
rosemary
nods
upon
the
grave
the
lily
lolls
upon
the
wave
wrapping
the
fog
about
its
breast
the
ruin
moulders
into
rest
looking
like
lethe
see
the
lake
a
conscious
slumber
seems
to
take
and
would
not
for
the
world
awake
all
beauty
sleeps
and
lo
where
lies
irene
with
her
destinies
oh
lady
bright
can
it
be
right
this
window
open
to
the
night
the
wanton
airs
from
the
laughingly
through
the
lattice
drop
the
bodiless
airs
a
wizard
rout
flit
through
thy
chamber
in
and
out
and
wave
the
curtain
canopy
so
fitfully
so
fearfully
above
the
closed
and
fringéd
lid
which
thy
soul
lies
hid
that
the
floor
and
down
the
wall
like
ghosts
the
shadows
rise
and
fall
oh
lady
dear
hast
thou
no
fear
why
and
what
art
thou
dreaming
here
sure
thou
art
come
seas
a
wonder
to
these
garden
trees
strange
is
thy
pallor
strange
thy
dress
strange
above
all
thy
length
of
tress
and
this
all
solemn
silentness
the
lady
sleeps
oh
may
her
sleep
which
is
enduring
so
be
deep
heaven
have
her
in
its
sacred
keep
this
chamber
changed
for
one
more
holy
this
bed
for
one
more
melancholy
i
pray
to
god
that
she
may
lie
forever
with
unopened
eye
while
the
pale
sheeted
ghosts
go
by
my
love
she
sleeps
oh
may
her
sleep
as
it
is
lasting
so
be
deep
soft
may
the
worms
about
her
creep
far
in
the
forest
dim
and
old
for
her
may
some
tall
vault
unfold
some
vault
that
oft
hath
flung
its
black
and
winged
pannels
fluttering
back
triumphant
the
crested
palls
of
her
grand
family
funerals
some
sepulchre
remote
alone
against
whose
portal
she
hath
thrown
in
childhood
many
an
idle
stone
some
tomb
from
out
whose
sounding
door
she
shall
force
an
echo
more
thrilling
to
think
poor
child
of
sin
it
was
the
dead
who
groaned
within
lenore
ah
broken
is
the
golden
bowl
the
spirit
flown
forever
let
the
bell
toll
a
saintly
soul
floats
on
the
stygian
river
and
guy
de
vere
hast
no
tear
weep
now
or
never
more
see
on
yon
drear
and
rigid
bier
low
lies
thy
love
lenore
come
let
the
burial
rite
be
read
the
funeral
song
be
sung
an
anthem
for
the
queenliest
dead
that
ever
died
so
young
a
dirge
for
her
the
doubly
dead
in
that
she
died
so
young
wretches
ye
loved
her
for
her
wealth
and
hated
her
for
her
pride
and
when
she
fell
in
feeble
health
ye
blessed
her
that
she
died
how
the
ritual
then
be
read
the
requiem
how
be
sung
by
you
by
yours
the
evil
eye
by
yours
the
slanderous
tongue
that
did
to
death
the
innocence
that
died
and
died
so
young
but
rave
not
thus
and
let
a
sabbath
song
go
up
to
god
so
solemnly
the
dead
may
feel
no
wrong
the
sweet
lenore
hath
gone
before
with
hope
that
flew
beside
leaving
thee
wild
for
the
dear
child
that
should
have
been
thy
bride
for
her
the
fair
and
debonair
that
now
so
lowly
lies
the
life
upon
her
yellow
hair
but
not
within
her
eyes
the
life
still
there
upon
her
hair
the
death
upon
her
eyes
avaunt
avaunt
from
friends
below
the
indignant
ghost
is
riven
from
hell
unto
a
high
estate
far
up
within
the
heaven
from
grief
and
groan
to
a
golden
throne
beside
the
king
of
heaven
let
no
bell
toll
then
lest
her
soul
amid
its
hallowed
mirth
should
catch
the
note
as
it
doth
float
up
from
the
damnéd
earth
and
i
my
heart
is
light
no
dirge
will
i
upraise
but
waft
the
angel
on
her
flight
with
a
pæan
of
old
days
the
valley
of
unrest
once
it
smiled
a
silent
dell
where
the
people
did
not
dwell
they
had
gone
unto
the
wars
trusting
to
the
stars
nightly
from
their
azure
towers
to
keep
watch
above
the
flowers
in
the
midst
of
which
all
day
the
red
sunlight
lazily
lay
now
each
visitor
shall
confess
the
sad
valley
restlessness
nothing
there
is
motionless
nothing
save
the
airs
that
brood
over
the
magic
solitude
ah
by
no
wind
are
stirred
those
trees
that
palpitate
like
the
chill
seas
around
the
misty
hebrides
ah
by
no
wind
those
clouds
are
driven
that
rustle
through
the
unquiet
heaven
uneasily
from
morn
till
even
over
the
violets
there
that
lie
in
myriad
types
of
the
human
eye
over
the
lilies
there
that
wave
and
weep
above
a
nameless
grave
they
wave
from
out
their
fragrant
tops
eternal
dews
come
down
in
drops
they
weep
from
off
their
delicate
stems
perennial
tears
descend
in
gems
the
coliseum
type
of
the
antique
rome
rich
reliquary
of
lofty
contemplation
left
to
time
by
buried
centuries
of
pomp
and
power
at
length
at
length
after
so
many
days
of
weary
pilgrimage
and
burning
thirst
thirst
for
the
springs
of
lore
that
in
thee
lie
i
kneel
an
altered
and
an
humble
man
amid
thy
shadows
and
so
drink
within
my
very
soul
thy
grandeur
gloom
and
glory
vastness
and
age
and
memories
of
eld
silence
and
desolation
and
dim
night
i
feel
ye
now
i
feel
ye
in
your
strength
o
spells
more
sure
than
judæan
king
taught
in
the
gardens
of
gethsemane
o
charms
more
potent
than
the
rapt
chaldee
ever
drew
down
from
out
the
quiet
stars
here
where
a
hero
fell
a
column
falls
here
where
the
mimic
eagle
glared
in
gold
a
midnight
vigil
holds
the
swarthy
bat
here
where
the
dames
of
rome
their
gilded
hair
waved
to
the
wind
now
wave
the
reed
and
thistle
here
where
on
golden
throne
the
monarch
lolled
glides
unto
his
marble
home
lit
by
the
wan
light
of
the
hornéd
moon
the
swift
and
silent
lizard
of
the
stones
but
stay
these
walls
these
arcades
these
mouldering
plinths
these
sad
and
blackened
shafts
these
vague
entablatures
this
crumbling
frieze
these
shattered
cornices
this
wreck
this
ruin
these
stones
alas
these
gray
stones
are
they
all
all
of
the
famed
and
the
colossal
left
by
the
corrosive
hours
to
fate
and
me
not
all
the
echoes
answer
me
not
all
prophetic
sounds
and
loud
arise
forever
from
us
and
from
all
ruin
unto
the
wise
as
melody
from
memnon
to
the
sun
we
rule
the
hearts
of
mightiest
men
we
rule
with
a
despotic
sway
all

we
are
not
impotent
we
pallid

not
all
our

is
gone
not
all
our

not
all
the
magic
of
our
high
renown
not
all
the

that
encircles
us
not
all
the
mysteries
that
in
us
lie
not
all
the

that
hang
upon
and

around
about
us

thou
hast

my
hymn
in

in

and
ill
mother
of

be
with
me
still
when
the
hours
flew
brightly
by
and
not
a
cloud
obscured
the

my
soul
lest
it
should
truant
be
thy
grace
did
guide
to
thine
and
thee
now
when
storms
of
fate
darkly
my
present
and
my
past
let
my
future
radiant
shine
with
sweet
hopes
of
thee
and
thine
to
one
in
paradise
thou
wast
all
that
to
me

for
which
my
soul
did
pine
a
green
isle
in
the
sea
love
a
fountain
and
a
shrine
all
wreathed
with
fairy
fruits
and
flowers
and
all
the
flowers
were
mine
ah
dream
too
bright
to
last
ah
starry
hope
that
didst
arise
but
to
be
overcast
a
voice
from
out
the
future
cries
on
on
but
the
past
dim
gulf
my
spirit
hovering
lies
mute
motionless
aghast
for
alas
alas
with
me
the
light
of
life
is
no
more
no
more
no
more
such
language
holds
the
solemn
sea
to
the
sands
upon
the
shore
shall
bloom
the
tree
or
the
stricken
eagle
soar
and
all
my
days
are
trances
and
all
my
nightly
dreams
are
where
thy
gray
eye
glances
and
where
thy
footstep
gleams
in
what
ethereal
dances
by
what
eternal
streams
to
f
beloved
amid
the
earnest
woes
that
crowd
around
my
earthly
path
drear
path
alas
where
grows
not
even
one
lonely
rose
my
soul
at
least
a
solace
hath
in
dreams
of
thee
and
therein
knows
an
eden
of
bland
repose
and
thus
thy
memory
is
to
me
like
some
enchanted
isle
in
some
tumultuous
sea
some
ocean
throbbing
far
and
free
with
storms
but
where
meanwhile
serenest
skies
continually
just
that
one
bright
island
smile
to
f

d
thou
wouldst
be
loved
then
let
thy
heart
from
its
present
pathway
part
not
being
everything
which
now
thou
art
be
nothing
which
thou
art
not
so
with
the
world
thy
gentle
ways
thy
grace
thy
more

shall
be
an
endless

of
praise
and

from

of

of

that

bridal
ballad
the
ring
is
on
my
hand
and
the
wreath
is
on
my
brow
satins
and
jewels
grand
are
all
at
my
command
and
i
am
happy
now
and
my
lord
he
loves
me
well
but
when
first
he
breathed
his
vow
i
felt
my
bosom
swell
for
the
words
rang
as
a
knell
and
the
voice
seemed
his
who
fell
in
the
battle
down
the
dell
and
who
is
happy
now
but
he
spoke
to
reassure
me
and
he
kissed
my
pallid
brow
while
a
reverie
came
me
and
to
the
bore
me
and
i
sighed
to
him
before
me
thinking
him
dead
oh
i
am
happy
now
and
thus
the
words
were
spoken
and
this
the
plighted
vow
and
though
my
faith
be
broken
and
though
my
heart
be
broken
here
is
a
ring
as
token
that
i
am
happy
now
would
god
i
could
awaken
for
i
dream
i
know
not
how
and
my
soul
is
sorely
shaken
lest
an
evil
step
be
taken
lest
the
dead
who
is
forsaken
may
not
be
happy
now
silence
there
are
some
qualities
some
incorporate
things
that
have
a
double
life
which
thus
is
made
a
type
of
that
twin
entity
which
springs
from
matter
and
light
evinced
in
solid
and
shade
there
is
a
twofold
silence
sea
and
shore
body
and
soul
one
dwells
in
lonely
places
newly
with
grass
some
solemn
graces
some
human
memories
and
tearful
lore
render
him
terrorless
his
name
no
more
he
is
the
corporate
silence
dread
him
not
no
power
hath
he
of
evil
in
himself
but
should
some
urgent
fate
untimely
lot
bring
thee
to
meet
his
shadow

elf
that
haunteth
the
lone
regions
where
hath

of

thyself
to
god
the
conqueror
worm
lo
is
a
gala
night
within
the
lonesome
latter
years
an
angel
throng
bewinged
bedight
in
veils
and
drowned
in
tears
sit
in
a
theatre
to
see
a
play
of
hopes
and
fears
while
the
orchestra
breathes
fitfully
the
music
of
the
spheres
mimes
in
the
form
of
god
on
high
mutter
and
mumble
low
and
hither
and
thither
fly
mere
puppets
they
who
come
and
go
at
bidding
of
vast
formless
things
that
shift
the
scenery
to
and
fro
flapping
from
out
their
condor
wings
invisible
woe
that
motley
drama
oh
be
sure
it
shall
not
be
forgot
with
its
phantom
chased
for
evermore
by
a
crowd
that
seize
it
not
through
a
circle
that
ever
returneth
in
to
the
spot
and
much
of
madness
and
more
of
sin
and
horror
the
soul
of
the
plot
but
see
amid
the
mimic
rout
a
crawling
shape
intrude
a
thing
that
writhes
from
out
the
scenic
solitude
it
writhes
it
writhes
with
mortal
pangs
the
mimes
become
its
food
and
seraphs
sob
at
vermin
fangs
in
human
gore
imbued
out
out
are
the
lights
out
all
and
over
each
quivering
form
the
curtain
a
funeral
pall
comes
down
with
the
rush
of
a
storm
while
the
angels
all
pallid
and
wan
uprising
unveiling
affirm
that
the
play
is
the
tragedy
man
and
its
hero
the
conqueror
worm
by
a
route
obscure
and
lonely
haunted
by
ill
angels
only
where
an
eidolon
named
night
on
a
black
throne
reigns
upright
i
have
reached
these
lands
but
newly
from
an
ultimate
dim
thule
from
a
wild
weird
clime
that
lieth
sublime
out
of
space
out
of
time
bottomless
vales
and
boundless
floods
and
chasms
and
caves
and
titan
woods
with
forms
that
no
man
can
discover
for
the
tears
that
drip
all
over
mountains
toppling
evermore
into
seas
without
a
shore
seas
that
restlessly
aspire
surging
unto
skies
of
fire
lakes
that
endlessly
outspread
their
lone
waters
lone
and
dead
their
still
waters
still
and
chilly
with
the
snows
of
the
lolling
lily
by
the
lakes
that
thus
outspread
their
lone
waters
lone
and
dead
their
sad
waters
sad
and
chilly
with
the
snows
of
the
lolling
lily
by
the
mountains
near
the
river
murmuring
lowly
murmuring
ever
by
the
gray
woods
by
the
swamp
where
the
toad
and
the
newt
encamp
by
the
dismal
tarns
and
pools
where
dwell
the
ghouls
by
each
spot
the
most
unholy
in
each
nook
most
melancholy
there
the
traveller
meets
aghast
sheeted
memories
of
the
past
shrouded
forms
that
start
and
sigh
as
they
pass
the
wanderer
by
forms
of
friends
long
given
in
agony
to
the
earth
and
heaven
for
the
heart
whose
woes
are
legion
is
a
peaceful
soothing
region
for
the
spirit
that
walks
in
shadow
is
oh
is
an
eldorado
but
the
traveller
travelling
through
it
may
not
dare
not
openly
view
it
never
its
mysteries
are
exposed
to
the
weak
human
eye
unclosed
so
wills
its
king
who
hath
forbid
the
uplifting
of
the
fringéd
lid
and
thus
the
sad
soul
that
here
passes
beholds
it
but
through
darkened
glasses
by
a
route
obscure
and
lonely
haunted
by
ill
angels
only
where
an
eidolon
named
night
on
a
black
throne
reigns
upright
i
have
wandered
home
but
newly
from
this
ultimate
dim
thule
the
raven
once
upon
a
midnight
dreary
while
i
pondered
weak
and
weary
over
many
a
quaint
and
curious
volume
of
forgotten
lore
while
i
nodded
nearly
napping
suddenly
there
came
a
tapping
as
of
some
one
gently
rapping
rapping
at
my
chamber
door
is
some
visitor
i
muttered
tapping
at
my
chamber
door
only
this
and
nothing
more
ah
distinctly
i
remember
it
was
in
the
bleak
december
and
each
separate
dying
ember
wrought
its
ghost
upon
the
floor
eagerly
i
wished
the
morrow
vainly
i
had
sought
to
borrow
from
my
books
surcease
of
sorrow
sorrow
for
the
lost
lenore
for
the
rare
and
radiant
maiden
whom
the
angels
name
lenore
nameless
here
forevermore
and
the
silken
sad
uncertain
rustling
of
each
purple
curtain
thrilled
me
filled
me
with
fantastic
terrors
never
felt
before
so
that
now
to
still
the
beating
of
my
heart
i
stood
repeating
is
some
visitor
entreating
entrance
at
my
chamber
door
some
late
visitor
entreating
entrance
at
my
chamber
door
this
it
is
and
nothing
more
presently
my
soul
grew
stronger
hesitating
then
no
longer
sir
said
i
or
madam
truly
your
forgiveness
i
implore
but
the
fact
is
i
was
napping
and
so
gently
you
came
rapping
and
so
faintly
you
came
tapping
tapping
at
my
chamber
door
that
i
scarce
was
sure
i
heard
you
here
i
opened
wide
the
door
darkness
there
and
nothing
more
deep
into
that
darkness
peering
long
i
stood
there
wondering
fearing
doubting
dreaming
dreams
no
mortals
ever
dared
to
dream
before
but
the
silence
was
unbroken
and
the
stillness
gave
no
token
and
the
only
word
there
spoken
was
the
whispered
word
lenore
this
i
whispered
and
an
echo
murmured
back
the
word
lenore
merely
this
and
nothing
more
back
into
the
chamber
turning
all
my
soul
within
me
burning
soon
again
i
heard
a
tapping
somewhat
louder
than
before
surely
said
i
surely
that
is
something
at
my
window
lattice
let
me
see
then
what
thereat
is
and
this
mystery
explore
let
my
heart
be
still
a
moment
and
this
mystery
explore
is
the
wind
and
nothing
more
open
here
i
flung
the
shutter
when
with
many
a
flirt
and
flutter
in
there
stepped
a
stately
raven
of
the
saintly
days
of
yore
not
the
least
obeisance
made
he
not
a
minute
stopped
or
stayed
he
but
with
mien
of
lord
or
lady
perched
above
my
chamber
door
perched
upon
a
bust
of
pallas
just
above
my
chamber
door
perched
and
sat
and
nothing
more
then
this
ebony
bird
beguiling
my
sad
fancy
into
smiling
by
the
grave
and
stern
decorum
of
the
countenance
it
wore
though
thy
crest
be
shorn
and
shaven
thou
i
said
art
sure
no
craven
ghastly
grim
and
ancient
raven
wandering
from
the
nightly
shore
tell
me
what
thy
lordly
name
is
on
the
night
plutonian
shore
quoth
the
raven
nevermore
much
i
marvelled
this
ungainly
fowl
to
hear
discourse
so
plainly
though
its
answer
little
meaning
little
relevancy
bore
for
we
can
not
help
agreeing
that
no
living
human
being
ever
yet
was
blessed
with
seeing
bird
above
his
chamber
door
bird
or
beast
upon
the
sculptured
bust
above
his
chamber
door
with
such
name
as
nevermore
but
the
raven
sitting
lonely
on
the
placid
bust
spoke
only
that
one
word
as
if
his
soul
in
that
one
word
he
did
outpour
nothing
further
then
he
uttered
not
a
feather
then
he
fluttered
till
i
scarcely
more
than
muttered
other
friends
have
flown
before
on
the
morrow
will
leave
me
as
my
hopes
have
flown
before
then
the
bird
said
nevermore
startled
at
the
stillness
broken
by
reply
so
aptly
spoken
doubtless
said
i
what
it
utters
is
its
only
stock
and
store
caught
from
some
unhappy
master
whom
unmerciful
disaster
followed
fast
and
followed
faster
till
his
songs
one
burden
bore
till
the
dirges
of
his
hope
that
melancholy
burden
bore
of
nevermore
but
the
raven
still
beguiling
all
my
fancy
into
smiling
straight
i
wheeled
a
cushioned
seat
in
front
of
bird
and
bust
and
door
then
upon
the
velvet
sinking
i
betook
myself
to
linking
fancy
unto
fancy
thinking
what
this
ominous
bird
of
yore
what
this
grim
ungainly
ghastly
gaunt
and
ominous
bird
of
yore
meant
in
croaking
nevermore
this
i
sat
engaged
in
guessing
but
no
syllable
expressing
to
the
fowl
whose
fiery
eyes
now
burned
into
my
bosom
core
this
and
more
i
sat
divining
with
my
head
at
ease
reclining
on
the
cushion
velvet
lining
that
the
gloated
but
whose
velvet
violet
lining
with
the
gloating
shall
press
ah
nevermore
then
methought
the
air
grew
denser
perfumed
from
an
unseen
censer
swung
by
seraphim
whose
tinkled
on
the
tufted
floor
wretch
i
cried
thy
god
hath
lent
thee
by
these
angels
he
hath
sent
thee
respite
respite
and
nepenthe
from
thy
memories
of
lenore
quaff
oh
quaff
this
kind
nepenthe
and
forget
this
lost
lenore
quoth
the
raven
nevermore
prophet
said
i
thing
of
evil
prophet
still
if
bird
or
devil
whether
tempter
sent
or
whether
tempest
tossed
thee
here
ashore
desolate
yet
all
undaunted
on
this
desert
land
enchanted
on
this
home
by
horror
haunted
tell
me
truly
i
implore
is
there
there
balm
in
gilead
tell
me
tell
me
i
implore
quoth
the
raven

said
i
thing
of
evil
prophet
still
if
bird
or
devil
by
that
heaven
that
bends
above
us
by
that
god
we
both
adore
tell
this
soul
with
sorrow
laden
if
within
the
distant
aidenn
it
shall
clasp
a
sainted
maiden
whom
the
angels
name
lenore
clasp
a
rare
and
radiant
maiden
whom
the
angels
name
lenore
quoth
the
raven
nevermore
be
that
word
our
sign
of
parting
bird
or
fiend
i
shrieked
upstarting
get
thee
back
into
the
tempest
and
the
night
plutonian
shore
leave
no
black
plume
as
a
token
of
that
lie
thy
soul
hath
spoken
leave
my
loneliness
unbroken
quit
the
bust
above
my
door
take
thy
beak
from
out
my
heart
and
take
thy
form
from
off
my
door
quoth
the
raven
nevermore
and
the
raven
never
flitting
still
is
sitting
still
is
sitting
on
the
pallid
bust
of
pallas
just
above
my
chamber
door
and
his
eyes
have
all
the
seeming
of
a
demon
that
is
dreaming
and
the
him
streaming
throws
his
shadow
on
the
floor
and
my
soul
from
out
that
shadow
that
lies
floating
on
the
floor
shall
be
lifted
nevermore
eulalie
i
dwelt
alone
in
a
world
of
moan
and
my
soul
was
a
stagnant
tide
till
the
fair
and
gentle
eulalie
became
my
blushing
bride
till
the
young
eulalie
became
my
smiling
bride
ah
less
less
bright
the
stars
of
the
night
than
the
eyes
of
the
radiant
girl
and
never
a
flake
that
the
vapor
can
make
with
the
of
purple
and
pearl
can
vie
with
the
modest
eulalie
most
unregarded
curl
can
compare
with
the
eulalie
most
humble
and
careless
curl
now
doubt
now
pain
come
never
again
for
her
soul
gives
me
sigh
for
sigh
and
all
day
long
shines
bright
and
strong
astarte
within
the
sky
while
ever
to
her
dear
eulalie
upturns
her
matron
eye
while
ever
to
her
young
eulalie
upturns
her
violet
eye
to
of
all
who
hail
thy
presence
as
the
morning
of
all
to
whom
thine
absence
is
the
night
the
blotting
utterly
from
out
high
heaven
the
sacred
sun
of
all
who
weeping
bless
thee
hourly
for
hope
for
life
ah
above
all
for
the
resurrection
of
faith
in
truth
in
virtue
in
humanity
of
all
who
on
despair
unhallowed
bed
lying
down
to
die
have
suddenly
arisen
at
thy
words
let
there
be
light
at
the
words
that
were
fulfilled
in
the
seraphic
glancing
of
thine
eyes
of
all
who
owe
thee
most
whose
gratitude
nearest
resembles
worship
oh
remember
the
truest
the
most
fervently
devoted
and
think
that
these
weak
lines
are
written
by
him
by
him
who
as
he
pens
them
thrills
to
think
his
spirit
is
communing
with
an
angel
ulalume
the
skies
they
were
ashen
and
sober
the
leaves
they
were
crispéd
and
sere
the
leaves
they
were
withering
and
sere
it
was
night
in
the
lonesome
october
of
my
most
immemorial
year
it
was
hard
by
the
dim
lake
of
auber
in
the
misty
mid
region
of
weir
it
was
down
by
the
dank
tarn
of
auber
in
the
woodland
of
weir
here
once
through
an
alley
titanic
of
cypress
i
roamed
with
my
soul
of
cypress
with
psyche
my
soul
these
were
days
when
my
heart
was
volcanic
as
the
scoriac
rivers
that
roll
as
the
lavas
that
restlessly
roll
their
sulphurous
currents
down
yaanek
in
the
ultimate
climes
of
the
pole
that
groan
as
they
roll
down
mount
yaanek
in
the
realms
of
the
boreal
pole
our
talk
had
been
serious
and
sober
but
our
thoughts
they
were
palsied
and
sere
our
memories
were
treacherous
and
sere
for
we
knew
not
the
month
was
october
and
we
marked
not
the
night
of
the
year
ah
night
of
all
nights
in
the
year
we
noted
not
the
dim
lake
of
auber
though
once
we
had
journeyed
down
here
remembered
not
the
dank
tarn
of
auber
nor
the
woodland
of
weir
and
now
as
the
night
was
senescent
and
pointed
to
morn
as
the
hinted
of
morn
at
the
end
of
our
path
a
liquescent
and
nebulous
lustre
was
born
out
of
which
a
miraculous
crescent
arose
with
a
duplicate
horn
astarte
bediamonded
crescent
distinct
with
its
duplicate
horn
and
i
said
she
is
warmer
than
dian
she
rolls
through
an
ether
of
sighs
she
revels
in
a
region
of
sighs
she
has
seen
that
the
tears
are
not
dry
on
these
cheeks
where
the
worm
never
dies
and
has
come
past
the
stars
of
the
lion
to
point
us
the
path
to
the
skies
to
the
lethean
peace
of
the
skies
come
up
in
despite
of
the
lion
to
shine
on
us
with
her
bright
eyes
come
up
through
the
lair
of
the
lion
with
love
in
her
luminous
eyes
but
psyche
uplifting
her
finger
said
sadly
this
star
i
mistrust
her
pallor
i
strangely
mistrust
oh
hasten
oh
let
us
not
linger
oh
fly
let
us
fly
for
we
must
in
terror
she
spoke
letting
sink
her
wings
until
they
trailed
in
the
dust
in
agony
sobbed
letting
sink
her
plumes
till
they
trailed
in
the
dust
till
they
sorrowfully
trailed
in
the
dust
i
replied
this
is
nothing
but
dreaming
let
us
on
by
this
tremulous
light
let
us
bathe
in
this
crystalline
light
its
sibyllic
splendor
is
beaming
with
hope
and
in
beauty
see
it
flickers
up
the
sky
through
the
night
ah
we
safely
may
trust
to
its
gleaming
and
be
sure
it
will
lead
us
aright
we
safely
may
trust
to
a
gleaming
that
can
not
but
guide
us
aright
since
it
flickers
up
to
heaven
through
the
night
thus
i
pacified
psyche
and
kissed
her
and
tempted
her
out
of
her
gloom
and
conquered
her
scruples
and
gloom
and
we
passed
to
the
end
of
the
vista
but
were
stopped
by
the
door
of
a
tomb
by
the
door
of
a
legended
tomb
and
i
said
what
is
written
sweet
sister
on
the
door
of
this
legended
tomb
she
replied
ulalume
ulalume
is
the
vault
of
thy
lost
ulalume
then
my
heart
it
grew
ashen
and
sober
as
the
leaves
that
were
crisped
and
sere
as
the
leaves
that
were
withering
and
sere
and
i
cried
it
was
surely
october
on
this
very
night
of
last
year
that
i
journeyed
i
journeyed
down
here
that
i
brought
a
dread
burden
down
here
on
this
night
of
all
nights
in
the
year
ah
what
demon
has
tempted
me
here
well
i
know
now
this
dim
lake
of
auber
this
misty
mid
region
of
weir
well
i
know
now
this
dank
tarn
of
auber
this
woodland
of
weir
to
not
long
ago
the
writer
of
these
lines
in
the
mad
pride
of
intellectuality
maintained
the
power
of
words
denied
that
ever
a
thought
arose
within
the
human
brain
beyond
the
utterance
of
the
human
tongue
and
now
as
if
in
mockery
of
that
boast
two
words
two
foreign
soft
dissyllables
italian
tones
made
only
to
be
murmured
by
angels
dreaming
in
the
moonlit
dew
that
hangs
like
chains
of
pearl
on
hermon
hill
have
stirred
from
out
the
abysses
of
his
heart
thoughts
that
are
the
souls
of
thought
richer
far
wilder
far
diviner
visions
than
even
the
seraph
harper
israfel
who
has
the
sweetest
voice
of
all
god
creatures
could
hope
to
utter
and
i
my
spells
are
broken
the
pen
falls
powerless
from
my
shivering
hand
with
thy
dear
name
as
text
though
hidden
by
thee
i
can
not
write
i
can
not
speak
or
think
alas
i
can
not
feel
is
not
feeling
this
standing
motionless
upon
the
golden
threshold
of
the
gate
of
dreams
gazing
entranced
adown
the
gorgeous
vista
and
thrilling
as
i
see
upon
the
right
upon
the
left
and
all
the
way
along
amid
empurpled
vapors
far
away
to
where
the
prospect
terminates
thee
only
an
enigma
seldom
we
find
says
solomon
don
dunce
half
an
idea
in
the
profoundest
sonnet
through
all
the
flimsy
things
we
see
at
once
as
easily
as
through
a
naples
bonnet
trash
of
all
trash
how
can
a
lady
don
it
yet
heavier
far
than
your
petrarchan
stuff
nonsense
that
the
faintest
puff
twirls
into
the
while
you
con
it
and
veritably
sol
is
right
enough
the
general
tuckermanities
are
arrant
bubbles
ephemeral
and
transparent
but
is
now
you
may
depend
upon
it
stable
opaque
immortal
all
by
dint
of
the
dear
names
that
lie
concealed
within
to
helen
i
saw
thee
once
once
only
years
ago
i
must
not
say
how
many
but
not
many
it
was
a
july
midnight
and
from
out
a
moon
that
like
thine
own
soul
soaring
sought
a
precipitate
pathway
up
through
heaven
there
fell
a
veil
of
light
with
quietude
and
sultriness
and
slumber
upon
the
upturned
faces
of
a
thousand
roses
that
grew
in
an
enchanted
garden
where
no
wind
dared
to
stir
unless
on
tiptoe
fell
on
the
upturned
faces
of
these
roses
that
gave
out
in
return
for
the
their
odorous
souls
in
an
ecstatic
death
fell
on
the
upturned
faces
of
these
roses
that
smiled
and
died
in
this
parterre
enchanted
by
thee
and
by
the
poetry
of
thy
presence
clad
all
in
white
upon
a
violet
bank
i
saw
thee
half
reclining
while
the
moon
fell
on
the
upturned
faces
of
the
roses
and
on
thine
own
upturned
alas
in
sorrow
was
it
not
fate
that
on
this
july
midnight
was
it
not
fate
whose
name
is
also
sorrow
that
bade
me
pause
before
that
to
breathe
the
incense
of
those
slumbering
roses
no
footsteps
stirred
the
hated
world
all
slept
save
only
thee
and
me
o
heaven
o
god
how
my
heart
beats
in
coupling
those
two
words
save
only
thee
and
me
i
paused
i
looked
and
in
an
instant
all
things
disappeared
ah
bear
in
mind
this
garden
was
enchanted
the
pearly
lustre
of
the
moon
went
out
the
mossy
banks
and
the
meandering
paths
the
happy
flowers
and
the
repining
trees
were
seen
no
more
the
very
roses
odors
died
in
the
arms
of
the
adoring
airs
all
all
expired
save
thee
save
less
than
thou
save
only
the
divine
light
in
thine
eyes
save
but
the
soul
in
thine
uplifted
eyes
i
saw
but
them
they
were
the
world
to
me
i
saw
but
them
saw
only
them
for
hours
saw
only
them
until
the
moon
went
down
what
wild
seem
to
lie
enwritten
upon
those
crystalline
celestial
spheres
how
dark
a
woe
yet
how
sublime
a
hope
how
silently
serene
a
sea
of
pride
how
daring
an
ambition
yet
how
deep
how
fathomless
a
capacity
for
love
but
now
at
length
dear
dian
sank
from
sight
into
a
western
couch
of
and
thou
a
ghost
amid
the
entombing
trees
didst
glide
away
only
thine
eyes
remained
they
would
not
go
they
never
yet
have
gone
lighting
my
lonely
pathway
home
that
night
they
have
not
left
me
as
my
hopes
have
since
they
follow
me
they
lead
me
through
the
years
they
are
my
ministers
yet
i
their
slave
their
office
is
to
illumine
and
enkindle
my
duty
to
be
saved
by
their
bright
light
and
purified
in
their
electric
fire
and
sanctified
in
their
elysian
fire
they
fill
my
soul
with
beauty
which
is
hope
and
are
far
up
in
heaven
the
stars
i
kneel
to
in
the
sad
silent
watches
of
my
night
while
even
in
the
meridian
glare
of
day
i
see
them
still
two
sweetly
scintillant
venuses
unextinguished
by
the
sun
a
valentine
for
her
this
rhyme
is
penned
whose
luminous
eyes
brightly
expressive
as
the
twins
of
leda
shall
find
her
own
sweet
name
that
nestling
lies
upon
the
page
enwrapped
from
every
reader
search
narrowly
the
lines
they
hold
a
treasure
divine
a
talisman
an
amulet
that
must
be
worn
at
heart
search
well
the
measure
the
word
the
syllables
do
not
forget
the
trivialest
point
or
you
may
lose
your
labor
and
yet
there
is
in
this
no
gordian
knot
which
one
might
not
undo
without
a
sabre
if
one
could
merely
comprehend
the
plot
enwritten
upon
the
leaf
where
now
are
peering
eyes
scintillating
soul
there
lie
three
eloquent
words
oft
uttered
in
the
hearing
of
poets
by
poets
as
the
name
is
a
poet
too
its
letters
although
naturally
lying

for

thank
heaven
the
crisis
the
danger
is
past
and
the
lingering
illness
is
over
at
last
and
the
fever
called
living
is
conquered
at
last
sadly
i
know
i
am
shorn
of
my
strength
and
no
muscle
i
move
as
i
lie
at
full
length
but
no
matter
i
feel
i
am
better
at
length
and
i
rest
so
composedly
now
in
my
bed
that
any
beholder
might
fancy
me
dead
might
start
at
beholding
me
thinking
me
dead
the
moaning
and
groaning
the
sighing
and
sobbing
are
quieted
now
with
that
horrible
throbbing
at
heart
ah
that
horrible
horrible
throbbing
the
sickness
the
nausea
the
pitiless
pain
have
ceased
with
the
fever
that
maddened
my
brain
with
the
fever
called
living
that
burned
in
my
brain
and
oh
of
all
tortures
that
torture
the
worst
has
abated
the
terrible
torture
of
thirst
for
the
naphthaline
river
of
passion
accurst
i
have
drank
of
a
water
that
quenches
all
thirst
of
a
water
that
flows
with
a
lullaby
sound
from
a
spring
but
a
very
few
feet
under
ground
from
a
cavern
not
very
far
down
under
ground
and
ah
let
it
never
be
foolishly
said
that
my
room
it
is
gloomy
and
narrow
my
bed
for
man
never
slept
in
a
different
bed
and
you
must
slumber
in
just
such
a
bed
my
tantalized
spirit
here
blandly
reposes
forgetting
or
never
regretting
its
roses
its
old
agitations
of
myrtles
and
roses
for
now
while
so
quietly
lying
it
fancies
a
holier
odor
about
it
of
pansies
a
rosemary
odor
commingled
with
pansies
with
rue
and
the
beautiful
puritan
pansies
and
so
it
lies
happily
bathing
in
many
a
dream
of
the
truth
and
the
beauty
of
annie
drowned
in
a
bath
of
the
tresses
of
annie
she
tenderly
kissed
me
she
fondly
caressed
and
then
i
fell
gently
to
sleep
on
her
breast
deeply
to
sleep
from
the
heaven
of
her
breast
when
the
light
was
extinguished
she
covered
me
warm
and
she
prayed
to
the
angels
to
keep
me
from
harm
to
the
queen
of
the
angels
to
shield
me
from
harm
and
i
lie
so
composedly
now
in
my
bed
knowing
her
love
that
you
fancy
me
dead
and
i
rest
so
contentedly
now
in
my
bed
with
her
love
at
my
breast
that
you
fancy
me
dead
that
you
shudder
to
look
at
me
thinking
me
dead
but
my
heart
it
is
brighter
than
all
of
the
many
stars
in
the
sky
for
it
sparkles
with
annie
it
glows
with
the
light
of
the
love
of
my
annie
with
the
thought
of
the
light
of
the
eyes
of
my
annie
the

hear
the

what
a
world
of
merriment
their
melody
foretells
how
they
tinkle
tinkle
tinkle
in
the
icy
air
of
night
while
the
stars
that
oversprinkle
all
the
heavens
seem
to
twinkle
with
a
crystalline
deligit
keeping

foretells
through

balmy

of
night
how
they
ring
out
their
delight
from
the
notes
and
all
in
tune
what
a
liquid
ditty
floats
to
the
that
listens
while
she
gloats
on
the

oh
from
out
the
sounding
cells
what
a
gush
of
euphony
voluminously
wells
how
it
swells

dwells
on

what
a
tale
of
terror
now
their

tells
in
the
startled
ear

night
how
they
scream
out
their
affright
too
much
horrified
to
speak
they
can
only
shriek
shriek
out
of
tune
in
a
clamorous
appealing
to
the
mercy
of
the
fire
in
a
mad
expostulation
with
the
deaf
and
frantic
fire
leaping
higher

with
a
desperate
desire
and
a
resolute
endeavor
now

how
they
clang

what
a
horror
they
outpour
on
the
bosom
of
the
palpitating
air
yet
the
ear
it
fully
knows
by
the
twanging
and
the
clanging
how
the
danger
ebbs
and
flows
yet
the
ear
distinctly
tells
in
the
jangling

the
wrangling
how
the
danger
sinks
and
swells
by
the

the
swelling
in
the
anger

we
shiver
with
affright
at
the
melancholy
menace
of
their
tone
for
every
sound
that
floats
from
the
rust
within
their
throats
is
a
groan
and
the
people
ah
the
people
they
that
dwell
up
in
the
steeple
all
alone
and
who
tolling

in

muffled

a

annabel
lee
it
was
many
and
many
a
year
ago
in
a
kingdom
by
the
sea
that
a
maiden
there
lived
whom
you
may
know
by
the
name
of
annabel
lee
and
this
maiden
she
lived
with
no
other
thought
than
to
love
and
be
loved
by
me
i
was
a
child
and
she
was
a
child
in
this
kingdom
by
the
sea
but
we
loved
with
a
love
that
was
more
than
love
i
and
my
annabel
lee
with
a
love
that
the
winged
seraphs
of
heaven
coveted
her
and
me
and
this
was
the
reason
that
long
ago
in
this
kingdom
by
the
sea
a
wind
blew
out
of
a
cloud
chilling
my
beautiful
annabel
lee
so
that
her
highborn
kinsmen
came
and
bore
her
away
from
me
to
shut
her
up
in
a
sepulchre
in
this
kingdom
by
the
sea
the
angels
not
half
so
happy
in
heaven
went
envying
her
and
me
yes
that
was
the
reason
as
all
men
know
in
this
kingdom
by
the
sea
that
the
wind
came
out
of
the
cloud
by
night
chilling
and
killing
my
annabel
lee
but
our
love
it
was
stronger
by
far
than
the
love
of
those
who
were
older
than
we
of
many
far
wiser
than
we
and
neither
the
angels
in
heaven
above
nor
the
demons
down
under
the
sea
can
ever
dissever
my
soul
from
the
soul
of
the
beautiful
annabel
lee
for
the
moon
never
beams
without
bringing
me
dreams
of
the
beautiful
annabel
lee
and
the
stars
never
rise
but
i
feel
the
bright
eyes
of
the
beautiful
annabel
lee
and
so
all
the
i
lie
down
by
the
side
of
my
darling
my
darling
my
life
and
my
bride
in
her
sepulchre
there
by
the
sea
in
her
tomb
by
the
sounding
sea
to
my
mother
because
i
feel
that
in
the
heavens
above
the
angels
whispering
to
one
another
can
find
among
their
burning
terms
of
love
none
so
devotional
as
that
of
mother
therefore
by
that
dear
name
i
long
have
called
you
you
who
are
more
than
mother
unto
me
and
fill
my
heart
of
hearts
where
death
installed
you
in
setting
my
virginia
spirit
free
my
mother
my
own
mother
who
died
early
was
but
the
mother
of
myself
but
you
are
mother
to
the
one
i
loved
so
dearly
and
thus
are
dearer
than
the
mother
i
knew
by
that
infinity
with
which
my
wife
was
dearer
to
my
soul
than
its
eldorado
gayly
bedight
a
gallant
knight
in
sunshine
and
in
shadow
had
journeyed
long
singing
a
song
in
search
of
eldorado
but
he
grew
old
this
knight
so
bold
and
his
heart
a
shadow
fell
as
he
found
no
spot
of
ground
that
looked
like
eldorado
and
as
his
strength
failed
him
at
length
he
met
a
pilgrim
shadow
shadow
said
he
where
can
it
be

land
of

over
the

of

during
the
whole
of
a
dull
dark
and
soundless
day
in
the
autumn
of
the
year
when
the
clouds
hung
oppressively
low
in
the
heavens
i
had
been
passing
alone
on
horseback
through
a
singularly
dreary
tract
of
country
and
at
length
found
myself
as
the
shades
of
the
evening
drew
on
within
view
of
the
melancholy
house
of
usher
i
know
not
how
it
was
but
with
the
first
glimpse
of
the
building
a
sense
of
insufferable
gloom
pervaded
my
spirit
i
say
insufferable
for
the
feeling
was
unrelieved
by
any
of
that
because
poetic
sentiment
with
which
the
mind
usually
receives
even
the
sternest
natural
images
of
the
desolate
or
terrible
i
looked
upon
the
scene
before
me
upon
the
mere
house
and
the
simple
landscape
features
of
the
domain
upon
the
bleak
walls
upon
the
vacant
windows
upon
a
few
rank
sedges
and
upon
a
few
white
trunks
of
decayed
trees
with
an
utter
depression
of
soul
which
i
can
compare
to
no
earthly
sensation
more
properly
than
to
the
of
the
reveller
upon
opium
the
bitter
lapse
into
everyday
life
the
hideous
dropping
off
of
the
veil
there
was
an
iciness
a
sinking
a
sickening
of
the
heart
an
unredeemed
dreariness
of
thought
which
no
goading
of
the
imagination
could
torture
into
aught
of
the
sublime
what
was
it
i
paused
to
think
what
was
it
that
so
unnerved
me
in
the
contemplation
of
the
house
of
usher
it
was
a
mystery
all
insoluble
nor
could
i
grapple
with
the
shadowy
fancies
that
crowded
upon
me
as
i
pondered
i
was
forced
to
fall
back
upon
the
unsatisfactory
conclusion
that
while
beyond
doubt
there
combinations
of
very
simple
natural
objects
which
have
the
power
of
thus
affecting
us
still
the
analysis
of
this
power
lies
among
considerations
beyond
our
depth
it
was
possible
i
reflected
that
a
mere
different
arrangement
of
the
particulars
of
the
scene
of
the
details
of
the
picture
would
be
sufficient
to
modify
or
perhaps
to
annihilate
its
capacity
for
sorrowful
impression
and
acting
upon
this
idea
i
reined
my
horse
to
the
precipitous
brink
of
a
black
and
lurid
tarn
that
lay
in
unruffled
lustre
by
the
dwelling
and
gazed
down
but
with
a
shudder
even
more
thrilling
than
before
upon
the
remodelled
and
inverted
images
of
the
gray
sedge
and
the
ghastly
and
the
vacant
and
windows
nevertheless
in
this
mansion
of
gloom
i
now
proposed
to
myself
a
sojourn
of
some
weeks
its
proprietor
roderick
usher
had
been
one
of
my
boon
companions
in
boyhood
but
many
years
had
elapsed
since
our
last
meeting
a
letter
however
had
lately
reached
me
in
a
distant
part
of
the
country
a
letter
from
him
which
in
its
wildly
inportunate
nature
had
admitted
of
no
other
than
a
personal
reply
the
gave
evidence
of
nervous
agitation
the
writer
spoke
of
acute
bodily
illness
of
a
mental
disorder
which
oppressed
him
and
of
an
earnest
desire
to
see
me
as
his
best
and
indeed
his
only
personal
friend
with
a
view
of
attempting
by
the
cheerfulness
of
my
society
some
alleviation
of
his
malady
it
was
the
manner
in
which
all
this
and
much
more
was
said
it
was
the
apparent
that
went
with
his
request
which
allowed
me
no
room
for
hesitation
and
i
accordingly
obeyed
forthwith
what
i
still
considered
a
very
singular
summons
although
as
boys
we
had
been
even
intimate
associates
yet
i
really
knew
little
of
my
friend
his
reserve
had
been
always
excessive
and
habitual
i
was
aware
however
that
his
very
ancient
family
had
been
noted
time
out
of
mind
for
a
peculiar
sensibility
of
temperament
displaying
itself
through
long
ages
in
many
works
of
exalted
art
and
manifested
of
late
in
repeated
deeds
of
munificent
yet
unobtrusive
charity
as
well
as
in
a
passionate
devotion
to
the
intricacies
perhaps
even
more
than
to
the
orthodox
and
easily
recognizable
beauties
of
musical
science
i
had
learned
too
the
very
remarkable
fact
that
the
stem
of
the
usher
race
all
as
it
was
had
put
forth
at
no
period
any
enduring
branch
in
other
words
that
the
entire
family
lay
in
the
direct
line
of
descent
and
had
always
with
very
trifling
and
very
temporary
variation
so
lain
it
was
this
deficiency
i
considered
while
running
over
in
thought
the
perfect
keeping
of
the
character
of
the
premises
with
the
accredited
character
of
the
people
and
while
speculating
upon
the
possible
influence
which
the
one
in
the
long
lapse
of
centuries
might
have
exercised
upon
the
other
it
was
this
deficiency
perhaps
of
collateral
issue
and
the
consequent
undeviating
transmission
from
sire
to
son
of
the
patrimony
with
the
name
which
had
at
length
so
identified
the
two
as
to
merge
the
original
title
of
the
estate
in
the
quaint
and
equivocal
appellation
of
the
house
of
usher
an
appellation
which
seemed
to
include
in
the
minds
of
the
peasantry
who
used
it
both
the
family
and
the
family
mansion
i
have
said
that
the
sole
effect
of
my
somewhat
childish
experiment
that
of
looking
down
within
the
tarn
had
been
to
deepen
the
first
singular
impression
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
consciousness
of
the
rapid
increase
of
my
superstition
for
why
should
i
not
so
term
it
served
mainly
to
accelerate
the
increase
itself
such
i
have
long
known
is
the
paradoxical
law
of
all
sentiments
having
terror
as
a
basis
and
it
might
have
been
for
this
reason
only
that
when
i
again
uplifted
my
eyes
to
the
house
itself
from
its
image
in
the
pool
there
grew
in
my
mind
a
strange
fancy
a
fancy
so
ridiculous
indeed
that
i
but
mention
it
to
show
the
vivid
force
of
the
sensations
which
oppressed
me
i
had
so
worked
upon
my
imagination
as
really
to
believe
that
about
the
whole
mansion
and
domain
there
hung
an
atmosphere
peculiar
to
themselves
and
their
immediate
vicinity
an
atmosphere
which
had
no
affinity
with
the
air
of
heaven
but
which
had
reeked
up
from
the
decayed
trees
and
the
gray
wall
and
the
silent
tarn
a
pestilent
and
mystic
vapor
dull
sluggish
faintly
discernible
and
shaking
off
from
my
spirit
what
have
been
a
dream
i
scanned
more
narrowly
the
real
aspect
of
the
building
its
principal
feature
seemed
to
be
that
of
an
excessive
antiquity
the
discoloration
of
ages
had
been
great
minute
fungi
overspread
the
whole
exterior
hanging
in
a
fine
tangled
from
the
eaves
yet
all
this
was
apart
from
any
extraordinary
dilapidation
no
portion
of
the
masonry
had
fallen
and
there
appeared
to
be
a
wild
inconsistency
between
its
still
perfect
adaptation
of
parts
and
the
crumbling
condition
of
the
individual
stones
in
this
there
was
much
that
reminded
one
of
the
specious
totality
of
old
which
has
rotted
for
long
years
in
some
neglected
vault
with
no
disturbance
from
the
breath
of
the
external
air
beyond
this
indication
of
extensive
decay
however
the
fabric
gave
little
token
of
instability
perhaps
the
eye
of
a
scrutinizing
observer
might
have
discovered
a
barely
perceptible
fissure
which
extending
from
the
roof
of
the
building
in
front
made
its
way
down
the
wall
in
a
zigzag
direction
until
it
became
lost
in
the
sullen
waters
of
the
tarn
noticing
these
things
i
rode
over
a
short
causeway
to
the
house
a
servant
in
waiting
took
my
horse
and
i
entered
the
gothic
archway
of
the
hall
a
valet
of
stealthy
step
thence
conducted
me
in
silence
through
many
dark
and
intricate
passages
in
my
progress
to
the
studio
of
his
master
much
that
i
encountered
on
the
way
contributed
i
know
not
how
to
heighten
the
vague
sentiments
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
while
the
objects
around
me
while
the
carvings
of
the
ceilings
the
sombre
tapestries
of
the
walls
the
ebon
blackness
of
the
floors
and
the
phantasmagoric
armorial
trophies
which
rattled
as
i
strode
were
but
matters
to
which
or
to
such
as
which
i
had
been
accustomed
from
my
infancy
while
i
hesitated
not
to
acknowledge
how
familiar
was
all
this
i
still
wondered
to
find
how
unfamiliar
were
the
fancies
which
ordinary
images
were
stirring
up
on
one
of
the
staircases
i
met
the
physician
of
the
family
his
countenance
i
thought
wore
a
mingled
expression
of
low
cunning
and
perplexity
he
accosted
me
with
trepidation
and
passed
on
the
valet
now
threw
open
a
door
and
ushered
me
into
the
presence
of
his
master
the
room
in
which
i
found
myself
was
very
large
and
lofty
the
windows
were
long
narrow
and
pointed
and
at
so
vast
a
distance
from
the
black
oaken
floor
as
to
be
altogether
inaccessible
from
within
feeble
gleams
of
encrimsoned
light
made
their
way
through
the
trellised
panes
and
served
to
render
sufficiently
distinct
the
more
prominent
objects
around
the
eye
however
struggled
in
vain
to
reach
the
remoter
angles
of
the
chamber
or
the
recesses
of
the
vaulted
and
fretted
ceiling
dark
draperies
hung
upon
the
walls
the
general
furniture
was
profuse
comfortless
antique
and
tattered
many
books
and
musical
instruments
lay
scattered
about
but
failed
to
give
any
vitality
to
the
scene
i
felt
that
i
breathed
an
atmosphere
of
sorrow
an
air
of
stern
deep
and
irredeemable
gloom
hung
over
and
pervaded
all
upon
my
entrance
usher
arose
from
a
sofa
on
which
he
had
been
lying
at
full
length
and
greeted
me
with
a
vivacious
warmth
which
had
much
in
it
i
at
first
thought
of
an
overdone
cordiality
of
the
constrained
effort
of
the
man
of
the
world
a
glance
however
at
his
countenance
convinced
me
of
his
perfect
sincerity
we
sat
down
and
for
some
moments
while
he
spoke
not
i
gazed
upon
him
with
a
feeling
half
of
pity
half
of
awe
surely
man
had
never
before
so
terribly
altered
in
so
brief
a
period
as
had
roderick
usher
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
could
bring
myself
to
admit
the
identity
of
the
wan
being
before
me
with
the
companion
of
my
early
boyhood
yet
the
character
of
his
face
had
been
at
all
times
remarkable
a
cadaverousness
of
complexion
an
eye
large
liquid
and
luminous
beyond
comparison
lips
somewhat
thin
and
very
pallid
but
of
a
surpassingly
beautiful
curve
a
nose
of
a
delicate
hebrew
model
but
with
a
breadth
of
nostril
unusual
in
similar
formations
a
finely
moulded
chin
speaking
in
its
want
of
prominence
of
a
want
of
moral
energy
hair
of
a
more
than
softness
and
tenuity
these
features
with
an
inordinate
expansion
above
the
regions
of
the
temple
made
up
altogether
a
countenance
not
easily
to
be
forgotten
and
now
in
the
mere
exaggeration
of
the
prevailing
character
of
these
features
and
of
the
expression
they
were
wont
to
convey
lay
so
much
of
change
that
i
doubted
to
whom
i
spoke
the
now
ghastly
pallor
of
the
skin
and
the
now
miraculous
lustre
of
the
eye
above
all
things
startled
and
even
awed
me
the
silken
hair
too
had
been
suffered
to
grow
all
unheeded
and
as
in
its
wild
gossamer
texture
it
floated
rather
than
fell
about
the
face
i
could
not
even
with
effort
connect
its
arabesque
expression
with
any
idea
of
simple
humanity
in
the
manner
of
my
friend
i
was
at
once
struck
with
an
incoherence
an
inconsistency
and
i
soon
found
this
to
arise
from
a
series
of
feeble
and
futile
struggles
to
overcome
an
habitual
trepidancy
an
excessive
nervous
agitation
for
something
of
this
nature
i
had
indeed
been
prepared
no
less
by
his
letter
than
by
reminiscences
of
certain
boyish
traits
and
by
conclusions
deduced
from
his
peculiar
physical
conformation
and
temperament
his
action
was
alternately
vivacious
and
sullen
his
voice
varied
rapidly
from
a
tremulous
indecision
when
the
animal
spirits
seemed
utterly
in
abeyance
to
that
species
of
energetic
concision
that
abrupt
weighty
unhurried
and
enunciation
that
leaden
and
perfectly
modulated
guttural
utterance
which
may
be
observed
in
the
lost
drunkard
or
the
irreclaimable
eater
of
opium
during
the
periods
of
his
most
intense
excitement
it
was
thus
that
he
spoke
of
the
object
of
my
visit
of
his
earnest
desire
to
see
me
and
of
the
solace
he
expected
me
to
afford
him
he
entered
at
some
length
into
what
he
conceived
to
be
the
nature
of
his
malady
it
was
he
said
a
constitutional
and
a
family
evil
and
one
for
which
he
despaired
to
find
a
remedy
a
mere
nervous
affection
he
immediately
added
which
would
undoubtedly
soon
pass
off
it
displayed
itself
in
a
host
of
unnatural
sensations
some
of
these
as
he
detailed
them
interested
and
bewildered
me
although
perhaps
the
terms
and
the
general
manner
of
the
narration
had
their
weight
he
suffered
much
from
a
morbid
acuteness
of
the
senses
the
most
insipid
food
was
alone
endurable
he
could
wear
only
garments
of
certain
texture
the
odors
of
all
flowers
were
oppressive
his
eyes
were
tortured
by
even
a
faint
light
and
there
were
but
peculiar
sounds
and
these
from
stringed
instruments
which
did
not
inspire
him
with
horror
to
an
anomalous
species
of
terror
i
found
him
a
bounden
slave
i
shall
perish
said
he
i
perish
in
this
deplorable
folly
thus
thus
and
not
otherwise
shall
i
be
lost
i
dread
the
events
of
the
future
not
in
themselves
but
in
their
results
i
shudder
at
the
thought
of
any
even
the
most
trivial
incident
which
may
operate
upon
this
intolerable
agitation
of
soul
i
have
indeed
no
abhorrence
of
danger
except
in
its
absolute
effect
in
terror
in
this
unnerved
in
this
pitiable
condition
i
feel
that
the
period
will
sooner
or
later
arrive
when
i
must
abandon
life
and
reason
together
in
some
struggle
with
the
grim
phantasm
fear
i
learned
moreover
at
intervals
and
through
broken
and
equivocal
hints
another
singular
feature
of
his
mental
condition
he
was
enchained
by
certain
superstitious
impressions
in
regard
to
the
dwelling
which
he
tenanted
and
whence
for
many
years
he
had
never
ventured
forth
in
regard
to
an
influence
whose
supposititious
force
was
conveyed
in
terms
too
shadowy
here
to
be
an
influence
which
some
peculiarities
in
the
mere
form
and
substance
of
his
family
mansion
had
by
dint
of
long
sufferance
he
said
obtained
over
his
spirit
an
effect
which
the
physique
of
the
gray
walls
and
turrets
and
of
the
dim
tarn
into
which
they
all
looked
down
had
at
length
brought
about
upon
the
morale
of
his
existence
he
admitted
however
although
with
hesitation
that
much
of
the
peculiar
gloom
which
thus
afflicted
him
could
be
traced
to
a
more
natural
and
far
more
palpable
origin
to
the
severe
and
illness
indeed
to
the
evidently
approaching
dissolution
of
a
tenderly
beloved
sister
his
sole
companion
for
long
years
his
last
and
only
relative
on
earth
her
decease
he
said
with
a
bitterness
which
i
can
never
forget
would
leave
him
him
the
hopeless
and
the
frail
the
last
of
the
ancient
race
of
the
ushers
while
he
spoke
the
lady
madeline
for
so
was
she
called
passed
slowly
through
a
remote
portion
of
the
apartment
and
without
having
noticed
my
presence
disappeared
i
regarded
her
with
an
utter
astonishment
not
unmingled
with
dread
and
yet
i
found
it
impossible
to
account
for
such
feelings
a
sensation
of
stupor
oppressed
me
as
my
eyes
followed
her
retreating
steps
when
a
door
at
length
closed
upon
her
my
glance
sought
instinctively
and
eagerly
the
countenance
of
the
brother
but
he
had
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
i
could
only
perceive
that
a
far
more
than
ordinary
wanness
had
overspread
the
emaciated
fingers
through
which
trickled
many
passionate
tears
the
disease
of
the
lady
madeline
had
long
baffled
the
skill
of
her
physicians
a
settled
apathy
a
gradual
wasting
away
of
the
person
and
frequent
although
transient
affections
of
a
partially
cataleptical
character
were
the
unusual
diagnosis
hitherto
she
had
steadily
borne
up
against
the
pressure
of
her
malady
and
had
not
betaken
herself
finally
to
bed
but
on
the
closing
in
of
the
evening
of
my
arrival
at
the
house
she
succumbed
as
her
brother
told
me
at
night
with
inexpressible
agitation
to
the
prostrating
power
of
the
destroyer
and
i
learned
that
the
glimpse
i
had
obtained
of
her
person
would
thus
probably
be
the
last
i
should
obtain
that
the
lady
at
least
while
living
would
be
seen
by
me
no
more
for
several
days
ensuing
her
name
was
unmentioned
by
either
usher
or
myself
and
during
this
period
i
was
busied
in
earnest
endeavors
to
alleviate
the
melancholy
of
my
friend
we
painted
and
read
together
or
i
listened
as
if
in
a
dream
to
the
wild
improvisations
of
his
speaking
guitar
and
thus
as
a
closer
and
still
closer
intimacy
admitted
me
more
unreservedly
into
the
recesses
of
his
spirit
the
more
bitterly
did
i
perceive
the
futility
of
all
attempt
at
cheering
a
mind
from
which
darkness
as
if
an
inherent
positive
quality
poured
forth
upon
all
objects
of
the
moral
and
physical
universe
in
one
unceasing
radiation
of
gloom
i
shall
ever
bear
about
me
a
memory
of
the
many
solemn
hours
i
thus
spent
alone
with
the
master
of
the
house
of
usher
yet
i
should
fail
in
any
attempt
to
convey
an
idea
of
the
exact
character
of
the
studies
or
of
the
occupations
in
which
he
involved
me
or
led
me
the
way
an
excited
and
highly
distempered
ideality
threw
a
sulphureous
lustre
over
all
his
long
improvised
dirges
will
ring
forever
in
my
ears
among
other
things
i
hold
painfully
in
mind
a
certain
singular
perversion
and
amplification
of
the
wild
air
of
the
last
waltz
of
von
weber
from
the
paintings
over
which
his
elaborate
fancy
brooded
and
which
grew
touch
by
touch
into
vaguenesses
at
which
i
shuddered
the
more
thrillingly
because
i
shuddered
knowing
not
why
from
these
paintings
vivid
as
their
images
now
are
before
me
i
would
in
vain
endeavor
to
educe
more
than
a
small
portion
which
should
lie
within
the
compass
of
merely
written
words
by
the
utter
simplicity
by
the
nakedness
of
his
designs
he
arrested
and
overawed
attention
if
ever
mortal
painted
an
idea
that
mortal
was
roderick
usher
for
me
at
least
in
the
circumstances
then
surrounding
me
there
arose
out
of
the
pure
abstractions
which
the
hypochondriac
contrived
to
throw
upon
his
canvas
an
intensity
of
intolerable
awe
no
shadow
of
which
felt
i
ever
yet
in
the
contemplation
of
the
certainly
glowing
yet
too
concrete
reveries
of
fuseli
one
of
the
phantasmagoric
conceptions
of
my
friend
partaking
not
so
rigidly
of
the
spirit
of
abstraction
may
be
shadowed
forth
although
feebly
in
words
a
small
picture
presented
the
interior
of
an
immensely
long
and
rectangular
vault
or
tunnel
with
low
walls
smooth
white
and
without
interruption
or
device
certain
accessory
points
of
the
design
served
well
to
convey
the
idea
that
this
excavation
lay
at
an
exceeding
depth
below
the
surface
of
the
earth
no
outlet
was
observed
in
any
portion
of
its
vast
extent
and
no
torch
or
other
artificial
source
of
light
was
discernible
yet
a
flood
of
intense
rays
rolled
throughout
and
bathed
the
whole
in
a
ghastly
and
inappropriate
splendor
i
have
just
spoken
of
that
morbid
condition
of
the
auditory
nerve
which
rendered
all
music
intolerable
to
the
sufferer
with
the
exception
of
certain
effects
of
stringed
instruments
it
was
perhaps
the
narrow
limits
to
which
he
thus
confined
himself
upon
the
guitar
which
gave
birth
in
great
measure
to
the
fantastic
character
of
his
performances
but
the
fervid
of
his
impromptus
could
not
be
so
accounted
for
they
must
have
been
and
were
in
the
notes
as
well
as
in
the
words
of
his
wild
fantasias
for
he
not
unfrequently
accompanied
himself
with
rhymed
verbal
improvisations
the
result
of
that
intense
mental
collectedness
and
concentration
to
which
i
have
previously
alluded
as
observable
only
in
particular
moments
of
the
highest
artificial
excitement
the
words
of
one
of
these
rhapsodies
i
have
easily
remembered
i
was
perhaps
the
more
forcibly
impressed
with
it
as
he
gave
it
because
in
the
under
or
mystic
current
of
its
meaning
i
fancied
that
i
perceived
and
for
the
first
time
a
full
consciousness
on
the
part
of
usher
of
the
tottering
of
his
lofty
reason
upon
her
throne
the
verses
which
were
entitled
the
haunted
palace
ran
very
nearly
if
not
accurately
thus
i
in
the
greenest
of
our
valleys
by
good
angels
tenanted
once
a
fair
and
stately
palace
radiant
palace
reared
its
head
in
the

it
stood
there

spread
a
pinion
over

so

yellow
glorious

on
its
roof
did
float
and
flow
this
all
this
was
in
the
olden
time
long
ago
and
every
gentle
air
that
dallied
in
that
sweet
day
along
the
ramparts
plumed
and
pallid
a
wingéd
odor
went
away
iii
wanderers
in
that
happy
valley
through
two
luminous
windows

spirits
moving
musically

about

sitting

his

befitting

which
came
flowing

sparkling

echoes

was

to
sing
in
voices
of

wit
and
wisdom

their

ah
let
us

for
never

shall
dawn
upon
him
desolate
and
round
about
his
home
the
glory
that
blushed
and
bloomed
is
but
a
story
of
the
old
time
entombed
vi
and
travellers
now
within
that
valley
through
the
windows
see
vast
forms
that
move
fantastically
to
a
discordant
melody
while
like
a
ghastly
rapid
river
through
the
pale
door
a
hideous
throng
rush
out
forever
and
laugh
but
smile
no
more
i
well
remember
that
suggestions
arising
from
this
ballad
led
us
into
a
train
of
thought
wherein
there
became
manifest
an
opinion
of
usher
which
i
mention
not
so
much
on
account
of
its
novelty
for
other
men
haye
thought
thus
as
on
account
of
the
pertinacity
with
which
he
maintained
it
this
opinion
in
its
general
form
was
that
of
the
sentience
of
all
vegetable
things
but
in
his
disordered
fancy
the
idea
had
assumed
a
more
daring
character
and
trespassed
under
certain
conditions
upon
the
kingdom
of
inorganization
i
lack
words
to
express
the
full
extent
or
the
earnest
of
his
persuasion
the
belief
however
was
connected
as
i
have
previously
hinted
with
the
gray
stones
of
the
home
of
his
the
conditions
of
the
sentience
had
been
here
he
imagined
fulfilled
in
the
method
of
collocation
of
these
stones
in
the
order
of
their
arrangement
as
well
as
in
that
of
the
many
fungi
which
overspread
them
and
of
the
decayed
trees
which
stood
around
above
all
in
the
long
undisturbed
endurance
of
this
arrangement
and
in
its
reduplication
in
the
still
waters
of
the
tarn
its
evidence
the
evidence
of
the
sentience
was
to
be
seen
he
said
and
i
here
started
as
he
spoke
in
the
gradual
yet
certain
condensation
of
an
atmosphere
of
their
own
about
the
waters
and
the
walls
the
result
was
discoverable
he
added
in
that
silent
yet
importunate
and
terrible
influence
which
for
centuries
had
moulded
the
destinies
of
his
family
and
which
made
what
i
now
saw
him
what
he
was

opinions

was
found
in
the
perusal

an
exceedingly
rare
and
curious
book
in
quarto
gothic
the
manual
of
a
forgotten
church
the
mortuorum
secundum

i
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
wild
ritual
of
this
work
and
of
its
probable
influence
upon
the
hypochondriac
when
one
evening
having
informed
me
abruptly
that
the
lady
madeline
was
no
more
he
stated
his
intention
of
preserving
her
corpse
for
a
fortnight
previously
to
its
final
interment
in
one
of
the
numerous
vaults
within
the
main
walls
of
the
building
the
worldly
reason
however
assigned
for
this
singular
proceeding
was
one
which
i
did
not
feel
at
liberty
to
dispute
the
brother
had
been
led
to
his
resolution
so
he
told
me
by
consideration
of
the
unusual
character
of
the
malady
of
the
deceased
of
certain
obtrusive
and
eager
inquiries
on
the
part
of
her
medical
men
and
of
the
remote
and
exposed
situation
of
the
of
the
family
i
will
not
deny
that
when
i
called
to
mind
the
sinister
countenance
of
the
person
whom
i
met
upon
the
staircase
on
the
day
of
my
arrival
at
the
house
i
had
no
desire
to
oppose
what
i
regarded
as
at
best
but
a
harmless
and
by
no
means
an
unnatural
precaution
at
the
request
of
usher
i
personally
aided
him
in
the
arrangements
for
the
temporary
entombment
the
body
having
been
encoffined
we
two
alone
bore
it
to
its
rest
the
vault
in
which
we
placed
it
and
which
had
been
so
long
unopened
that
our
torches
half
smothered
in
its
oppressive
atmosphere
gave
us
little
opportunity
for
investigation
was
small
damp
and
entirely
without
means
of
admission
for
light
lying
at
great
depth
immediately
beneath
that
portion
of
the
building
in
which
was
my
own
sleeping
apartment
it
had
been
used
apparently
in
remote
feudal
times
for
the
worst
purposes
of
a
and
in
later
days
as
a
place
of
deposit
for
powder
or
some
other
highly
combustible
substance
as
a
portion
of
its
floor
and
the
whole
interior
of
a
long
archway
through
which
we
reached
it
were
carefully
sheathed
with
copper
the
door
of
massive
iron
had
been
also
similarly
protected
its
immense
weight
caused
an
unusually
sharp
grating
sound
as
it
moved
upon
its
hinges
having
deposited
our
mournful
burden
upon
tressels
within
this
region
of
horror
we
partially
turned
aside
the
yet
unscrewed
lid
of
the
coffin
and
looked
upon
the
face
of
the
tenant
a
striking
similitude
between
the
brother
and
sister
now
first
arrested
my
attention
and
usher
divining
perhaps
my
thoughts
murmured
out
some
few
words
from
which
i
learned
that
the
deceased
and
himself
had
been
twins
and
that
sympathies
of
a
scarcely
intelligible
nature
had
always
existed
between
them
our
glances
however
rested
not
long
upon
the
dead
for
we
could
not
regard
her
unawed
the
disease
which
had
thus
entombed
the
lady
in
the
maturity
of
youth
had
left
as
usual
in
all
maladies
of
a
strictly
cataleptical
character
the
mockery
of
a
faint
blush
upon
the
bosom
and
the
face
and
that
suspiciously
lingering
smile
upon
the
lip
which
is
so
terrible
in
death
we
replaced
and
screwed
down
the
lid
and
having
secured
the
door
of
iron
made
our
way
with
toil
into
the
scarcely
less
gloomy
apartments
of
the
upper
portion
of
the
house
and
now
some
days
of
bitter
grief
having
elapsed
an
observable
change
came
over
the
features
of
the
mental
disorder
of
my
friend
his
ordinary
manner
had
vanished
his
ordinary
occupations
were
neglected
or
forgotten
he
roamed
from
chamber
to
chamber
with
hurried
unequal
and
objectless
step
the
pallor
of
his
countenance
had
assumed
if
possible
a
more
ghastly
hue
but
the
luminousness
of
his
eye
had
utterly
gone
out
the
once
occasional
huskiness
of
his
tone
was
heard
no
more
and
a
tremulous
quaver
as
if
of
extreme
terror
habitually
characterized
his
utterance
there
were
times
indeed
when
i
thought
his
unceasingly
agitated
mind
was
laboring
with
some
oppressive
secret
to
divulge
which
he
struggled
for
the
necessary
courage
at
times
again
i
was
obliged
to
resolve
all
into
the
mere
inexplicable
vagaries
of
madness
for
i
beheld
him
gazing
upon
vacancy
for
long
hours
in
an
attitude
of
the
profoundest
attention
as
if
listening
to
some
imaginary
sound
it
was
no
wonder
that
his
condition
terrified
that
it
infected
me
i
felt
creeping
upon
me
by
slow
yet
certain
degrees
the
wild
influences
of
his
own
fantastic
yet
impressive
superstitions
it
was
especially
upon
retiring
to
bed
late
in
the
night
of
the
seventh
or
eighth
day
after
the
placing
of
the
lady
madeline
within
the
donjon
that
i
experienced
the
full
power
of
such
feelings
sleep
came
not
near
my
couch
while
the
hours
waned
and
waned
away
i
struggled
to
reason
off
the
nervousness
which
had
dominion
over
me
i
endeavored
to
believe
that
much
if
not
all
of
what
i
felt
was
due
to
the
bewildering
influence
of
the
gloomy
furniture
of
the
room
of
the
dark
and
tattered
draperies
which
tortured
into
motion
by
the
breath
of
a
rising
tempest
swayed
fitfully
to
and
fro
upon
the
walls
and
rustled
uneasily
about
the
decorations
of
the
bed
but
my
efforts
were
fruitless
an
irrepressible
tremor
gradually
pervaded
my
frame
and
at
length
there
sat
upon
my
very
heart
an
incubus
of
utterly
causeless
alarm
shaking
this
off
with
a
gasp
and
a
struggle
i
uplifted
myself
upon
the
pillows
and
peering
earnestly
within
the
intense
darkness
of
the
chamber
hearkened
i
know
not
why
except
that
an
instinctive
spirit
prompted
me
to
certain
low
and
indefinite
sounds
which
came
through
the
pauses
of
the
storm
at
long
intervals
i
knew
not
whence
overpowered
by
an
intense
sentiment
of
horror
unaccountable
yet
unendurable
i
threw
on
my
clothes
with
haste
for
i
felt
that
i
should
sleep
no
more
during
the
night
and
endeavored
to
arouse
myself
from
the
pitiable
condition
into
which
i
had
fallen
by
pacing
rapidly
to
and
fro
through
the
apartment
i
had
taken
but
few
turns
in
this
manner
when
a
light
step
on
an
adjoining
staircase
arrested
my
attention
i
presently
recognized
it
as
that
of
usher
in
an
instant
afterward
he
rapped
with
a
gentle
touch
at
my
door
and
entered
bearing
a
lamp
his
countenance
was
as
usual
cadaverously
wan
but
moreover
there
was
a
species
of
mad
hilarity
in
his
eyes
an
evidently
restrained
hysteria
in
his
whole
demeanor
his
air
appalled
me
but
anything
was
preferable
to
the
solitude
which
i
had
so
long
endured
and
i
even
welcomed
his
presence
as
a
relief
and
you
have
not
seen
it
he
said
abruptly
after
having
stared
about
him
for
some
moments
in
silence
you
have
not
then
seen
it
but
stay
you
shall
thus
speaking
and
having
carefully
shaded
his
lamp
he
hurried
to
one
of
the
casements
and
threw
it
freely
open
to
the
storm
the
impetuous
fury
of
the
entering
gust
nearly
lifted
us
from
our
feet
it
was
indeed
a
tempestuous
yet
sternly
beautiful
night
and
one
wildly
singular
in
its
terror
and
its
beauty
a
whirlwind
had
apparently
collected
its
force
in
our
vicinity
for
there
were
frequent
and
violent
alterations
in
the
direction
of
the
wind
and
the
exceeding
density
of
the
clouds
which
hung
so
low
as
to
press
upon
the
turrets
of
the
house
did
not
prevent
our
perceiving
the
velocity
with
which
they
flew
careering
from
all
points
against
each
other
without
passing
away
into
the
distance
i
say
that
even
their
exceeding
density
did
not
prevent
our
perceiving
this
yet
we
had
no
glimpse
of
the
moon
or
stars
nor
was
there
any
flashing
forth
of
the
lightning
but
the
under
surfaces
of
the
huge
masses
of
agitated
vapor
as
well
as
all
terrestrial
objects
immediately
around
us
were
glowing
in
the
unnatural
light
of
a
faintly
luminous
and
distinctly
visible
gaseous
exhalation
which
hung
about
and
enshrouded
the
mansion
you
must
not
you
shall
not
behold
this
said
i
shudderingly
to
usher
as
i
led
him
with
a
gentle
violence
from
the
window
to
a
seat
these
appearances
which
bewilder
you
are
merely
electrical
phenomena
not
uncommon
or
it
may
be
that
they
have
their
ghastly
origin
in
the
rank
miasma
of
the
tarn
let
us
close
this
casement
the
air
is
chilling
and
dangerous
to
your
frame
here
is
one
of
your
favorite
romances
i
will
read
and
you
shall
listen
and
so
we
will
pass
away
this
terrible
night
together
the
antique
volume
which
i
had
taken
up
was
the
mad
trist
of
sir
launcelot
canning
but
i
had
called
it
a
favorite
of
usher
more
in
sad
jest
than
in
earnest
for
in
truth
there
is
little
in
its
uncouth
and
unimaginative
prolixity
which
could
have
had
interest
for
the
lofty
and
spiritual
ideality
of
my
friend
it
was
however
the
only
book
immediately
at
hand
and
i
indulged
a
vague
hope
that
the
excitement
which
now
agitated
the
hypochondriac
might
find
relief
for
the
history
of
mental
disorder
is
full
of
similar
anomalies
even
in
the
extremeness
of
the
folly
which
i
should
read
could
i
have
judged
indeed
by
the
wild
overstrained
air
of
vivacity
with
which
he
hearkened
or
apparently
hearkened
to
the
words
of
the
tale
i
might
well
have
congratulated
myself
upon
the
success
of
my
design
i
had
arrived
at
that
portion
of
the
story
where
ethelred
the
hero
of
the
trist
having
sought
in
vain
for
peaceable
admission
into
the
dwelling
of
the
hermit
proceeds
to
make
good
an
entrance
by
force
here
it
will
be
remembered
the
words
of
the
narrative
run
thus
and
ethelred
who
was
by
nature
of
a
doughty
heart
and
who
was
now
mighty
withal
on
account
of
the
powerfulness
of
the
wine
which
he
had
drunken
waited
no
longer
to
hold
parley
with
the
hermit
who
in
sooth
was
of
an
obstinate
and
maliceful
turn
but
feeling
the
rain
upon
his
shoulders
and
fearing
the
rising
of
the
tempest
uplifted
his
mace
outright
and
with
blows
made
quickly
room
in
the
plankings
of
the
door
for
his
gauntleted
hand
and
now
pulling
therewith
sturdily
he
so
cracked
and
ripped
and
tore
all
asunder
that
the
noise
of
the
dry
and
wood
alarumed
and
reverberated
throughout
the
forest
at
the
termination
of
this
sentence
i
started
and
for
a
moment
paused
for
it
appeared
to
me
although
i
at
once
concluded
that
my
excited
fancy
had
deceived
me
it
appeared
to
me
that
from
some
very
remote
portion
of
the
mansion
there
came
indistinctly
to
my
ears
what
might
have
been
in
its
exact
similarity
of
character
the
echo
but
a
stifled
and
dull
one
certainly
of
the
very
cracking
and
ripping
sound
which
sir
launcelot
had
so
particularly
described
it
was
beyond
doubt
the
coincidence
alone
which
had
arrested
my
attention
for
amid
the
rattling
of
the
sashes
of
the
casements
and
the
ordinary
commingled
noises
of
the
still
increasing
storm
the
sound
in
itself
had
nothing
surely
which
should
have
interested
or
disturbed
me
i
continued
the
story
but
the
good
champion
ethelred
now
entering
within
the
door
was
sore
enraged
and
amazed
to
perceive
no
signal
of
the
maliceful
hermit
but
in
the
stead
thereof
a
dragon
of
a
scaly
and
prodigious
demeanor
and
of
a
fiery
tongue
which
sate
in
guard
before
a
palace
of
gold
with
a
floor
of
silver
and
upon
the
wall
there
hung
a
shield
of
shining
brass
with
this
legend
enwritten
who
entereth
herein
a
conqueror
hath
bin
who
slayeth
the
dragon
the
shield
he
shall
win
and
ethelred
uplifted
his
mace
and
struck
upon
the
head
of
the
dragon
which
fell
before
him
and
gave
up
his
pesty
breath
with
a
shriek
so
horrid
and
harsh
and
withal
so
piercing
that
ethelred
had
fain
to
close
his
ears
with
his
hands
against
the
dreadful
noise
of
it
the
like
whereof
was
never
before
heard
here
again
i
paused
abruptly
and
now
with
a
feeling
of
wild
amazement
for
there
could
be
no
doubt
whatever
that
in
this
instance
i
did
actually
hear
although
from
what
direction
it
proceeded
i
found
it
impossible
to
say
a
low
and
apparently
distant
but
harsh
protracted
and
most
unusual
screaming
or
grating
sound
the
exact
counterpart
of
what
my
fancy
had
already
conjured
up
for
the
dragon
unnatural
shriek
as
described
by
the
romancer
oppressed
as
i
certainly
was
upon
the
occurrence
of
this
second
and
most
extraordinary
coincidence
by
a
thousand
conflicting
sensations
in
which
wonder
and
extreme
terror
were
predominant
i
still
retained
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
avoid
exciting
by
any
observation
the
sensitive
nervousness
of
my
companion
i
was
by
no
means
certain
that
he
had
noticed
the
sounds
in
question
although
assuredly
a
strange
alteration
had
during
the
last
few
minutes
taken
place
in
his
demeanor
from
a
position
fronting
my
own
he
had
gradually
brought
round
his
chair
so
as
to
sit
with
his
face
to
the
door
of
the
chamber
and
thus
i
could
but
partially
perceive
his
features
although
i
saw
that
his
lips
trembled
as
if
he
were
murmuring
inaudibly
his
head
had
dropped
upon
his
breast
yet
i
knew
that
he
was
not
asleep
from
the
wide
and
rigid
opening
of
the
eye
as
i
caught
a
glance
of
it
in
profile
the
motion
of
his
body
too
was
at
variance
with
this
idea
for
he
rocked
from
side
to
side
with
a
gentle
yet
constant
and
uniform
sway
having
rapidly
taken
notice
of
all
this
i
resumed
the
narrative
of
sir
launcelot
which
thus
proceeded
and
now
the
champion
having
escaped
from
the
terrible
fury
of
the
dragon
bethinking
himself
of
the
brazen
shield
and
of
the
breaking
up
of
the
enchantment
which
was
upon
it
removed
the
carcass
from
out
of
the
way
before
him
and
approached
valorously
over
the
silver
pavement
of
the
castle
to
where
the
shield
was
upon
the
wall
which
in
sooth
tarried
not
for
his
full
coming
but
fell
down
at
his
feet
upon
the
silver
floor
with
a
mighty
great
and
terrible
ringing
sound
no
sooner
had
these
syllables
passed
my
lips
than
as
if
a
shield
of
brass
had
indeed
at
the
moment
fallen
heavily
upon
a
floor
of
silver
i
became
aware
of
a
distinct
hollow
metallic
and
clangorous
yet
apparently
muffled
reverberation
completely
unnerved
i
leaped
to
my
feet
but
the
measured
rocking
movement
of
usher
was
undisturbed
i
rushed
to
the
chair
in
which
he
sat
his
eyes
were
bent
fixedly
before
him
and
throughout
his
whole
countenance
there
reigned
a
stony
rigidity
but
as
i
placed
my
hand
upon
his
shoulder
there
came
a
strong
shudder
over
his
whole
person
a
sickly
smile
quivered
about
his
lips
and
i
saw
that
he
spoke
in
a
low
hurried
and
gibbering
murmur
as
if
unconscious
of
my
presence
bending
closely
over
him
i
at
length
drank
in
the
hideous
import
of
his
words
not
hear
it
yes
i
hear
it
and
heard
it
long
long
long
many
minutes
many
hours
many
days
have
i
heard
it
yet
i
dared
not
oh
pity
me
miserable
wretch
that
i
am
i
dared
not
i
not
speak
have
put
her
living
in
the
tomb
said
i
not
that
my
senses
were
acute
i
tell
you
that
i
heard
her
first
feeble
movements
in
the
hollow
coffin
i
heard
them
many
many
days
ago
yet
i
dared
not
dared
not
speak
and
now
ethelred
ha
ha
the
breaking
of
the
door
and
the
of
the
dragon
and
the
clangor
of
the
shield
say
rather
the
rending
of
her
coffin
and
the
grating
of
the
iron
hinges
of
her
prison
and
her
struggles
within
the
coppered
archway
of
the
vault
oh
whither
shall
i
fly
will
she
not
be
here
anon
is
she
not
hurrying
to
upbraid
me
for
my
haste
have
i
not
heard
her
footstep
on
the
stair
do
i
not
distinguish
that
heavy
and
horrible
beating
of
her
heart
madman
here
he
sprang
furiously
to
his
feet
and
shrieked
out
his
syllables
as
if
in
the
effort
he
were
giving
up
his
soul
i
tell
you
that
she
now
stands
without
the
door
as
if
in
the
superhuman
energy
of
his
utterance
there
had
been
found
the
potency
of
a
spell
the
huge
antique
panels
to
hich
the
speaker
pointed
threw
slowly
back
upon
the
instant
their
ponderous
and
ebony
jaws
it
was
the
work
of
the
rushing
gust
but
then
without
those
doors
there
stand
the
lofty
and
enshrouded
figure
of
the
lady
madeline
of
usher
there
was
blood
upon
her
white
robes
and
the
evidence
of
some
bitter
struggle
upon
every
portion
of
her
emaciated
frame
for
a
moment
she
remained
trembling
and
reeling
to
and
fro
upon
the
threshold
then
with
a
low
moaning
cry
fell
heavily
inward
upon
the
person
of
her
brother
and
in
her
violent
and
now
final
bore
him
to
the
floor
a
corpse
and
a
victim
to
the
terrors
he
had
anticipated
from
that
chamber
and
from
that
mansion
i
fled
aghast
the
storm
was
still
abroad
in
all
its
wrath
as
i
found
myself
crossing
the
old
causeway
suddenly
there
shot
along
the
path
a
wild
light
and
i
turned
to
see
whence
a
gleam
so
unusual
could
have
issued
for
the
vast
house
and
its
shadows
were
alone
behind
me
the
radiance
was
that
of
the
full
setting
and
moon
which
now
shone
vividly
through
that
once
fissure
of
which
i
have
before
spoken
as
extending
from
the
roof
of
the
building
in
a
zigzag
direction
to
the
base
while
i
gazed
this
fissure
rapidly
widened
there
came
a
fierce
breath
of
the
whirlwind
the
entire
orb
of
the
satellite
burst
at
once
upon
my
sight
my
brain
reeled
as
i
saw
the
mighty
walls
rushing
asunder
there
was
a
long
tumultuous
shouting
sound
like
the
voice
of
a
thousand
waters
and
the
deep
and
dank
tarn
at
my
feet
closed
sullenly
and
silently
over
the
fragments
of
the
of
william
wilson
what
say
of
it
what
say
of
conscience
grim
that
spectre
in
my
path
chamberlayne
let
me
call
myself
for
the
present
william
wilson
the
fair
page
now
lying
before
me
need
not
be
sullied
with
my
real
appellation
this
has
been
already
too
much
an
object
for
the
scorn
for
the
horror
for
the
detestation
of
my
race
to
the
uttermost
regions
of
the
globe
have
not
the
indignant
winds
bruited
its
unparalleled
infamy
oh
outcast
of
all
outcasts
most
abandoned
to
the
earth
art
thou
not
forever
dead
to
its
honors
to
its
flowers
to
its
golden
aspirations
and
a
cloud
dense
dismal
and
limitless
does
it
not
hang
eternally
between
thy
hopes
and
heaven
i
would
not
if
i
could
here
or
embody
a
record
of
my
later
years
of
unspeakable
misery
and
unpardonable
crime
this
epoch
these
later
years
took
unto
themselves
a
sudden
elevation
in
turpitude
whose
origin
alone
it
is
my
present
purpose
to
assign
men
usually
grow
base
by
degrees
from
me
in
an
instant
all
virtue
dropped
bodily
as
a
mantle
from
comparatively
trivial
wickedness
i
passed
with
the
stride
of
a
giant
into
more
than
the
enormities
of
an
what
chance
what
one
event
brought
this
evil
thing
to
pass
bear
with
me
while
i
relate
death
approaches
and
the
shadow
which
foreruns
him
has
thrown
a
softening
influence
over
my
spirit
i
long
in
passing
through
the
dim
valley
for
the
sympathy
i
had
nearly
said
for
the
pity
of
my
i
would
fain
have
them
believe
that
i
have
been
in
some
measure
the
slave
of
circumstances
beyond
human
control
i
would
wish
them
to
seek
out
for
me
in
the
details
i
am
about
to
give
some
little
oasis
of
amid
a
wilderness
of
error
i
would
have
them
allow
what
they
can
not
refrain
from
allowing
that
although
temptation
may
have
erewhile
existed
as
great
man
was
never
at
least
tempted
before
certainly
never
fell
and
is
it
therefore
that
he
has
never
thus
suffered
have
i
not
indeed
been
living
in
a
dream
and
am
i
not
now
dying
a
victim
to
the
horror
and
the
mystery
of
the
wildest
of
all
sublunary
visions
i
am
the
descendant
of
a
race
whose
imaginative
and
easily
excitable
temperament
has
at
all
times
rendered
them
remarkable
and
in
my
earliest
infancy
i
gave
evidence
of
having
fully
inherited
the
family
character
as
i
advanced
in
years
it
was
more
strongly
developed
becoming
for
many
reasons
a
cause
of
serious
disquietude
to
my
friends
and
of
positive
injury
to
myself
i
grew
addicted
to
the
wildest
caprices
and
a
prey
to
the
most
ungovernable
passions
and
beset
with
constitutional
infirmities
akin
to
my
own
my
parents
could
do
but
little
to
check
the
evil
propensities
which
distinguished
me
some
feeble
and
efforts
resulted
in
complete
failure
on
their
part
and
of
course
in
total
triumph
on
mine
thenceforward
my
voice
was
a
household
law
and
at
an
age
when
few
children
have
abandoned
their
i
was
left
to
the
guidance
of
my
own
will
and
became
in
all
but
name
the
master
of
my
own
actions
my
earliest
recollections
of
a
are
connected
with
a
large
rambling
elizabethan
house
in
a
village
of
england
where
were
a
vast
number
of
gigantic
and
gnarled
trees
and
where
all
the
houses
were
excessively
ancient
in
truth
it
was
a
and
place
that
venerable
old
town
at
this
moment
in
fancy
i
feel
the
refreshing
chilliness
of
its
avenues
inhale
the
fragrance
of
its
thousand
shrubberies
and
thrill
anew
with
undefinable
delight
at
the
deep
hollow
note
of
the
breaking
each
hour
with
sullen
and
sudden
roar
upon
the
stillness
of
the
dusky
atmosphere
in
which
the
fretted
gothic
steeple
lay
imbedded
and
asleep
it
gives
me
perhaps
as
much
of
pleasure
as
i
can
now
in
any
manner
experience
to
dwell
upon
minute
recollections
of
the
school
and
its
concerns
steeped
in
misery
as
i
am
misery
alas
only
too
real
i
shall
be
pardoned
for
seeking
relief
however
slight
and
temporary
in
the
weakness
of
a
few
rambling
details
these
moreover
utterly
trivial
and
even
ridiculous
in
themselves
assume
to
my
fancy
adventitious
importance
as
connected
with
a
period
and
a
locality
when
and
where
i
recognize
the
first
ambiguous
monitions
of
the
destiny
which
afterwards
so
fully
overshadowed
me
let
me
then
remember
the
house
i
have
said
was
old
and
irregular
the
grounds
were
extensive
and
a
high
and
solid
brick
wall
topped
with
a
bed
of
mortar
and
broken
glass
encompassed
the
whole
this
rampart
formed
the
limit
of
our
domain
beyond
it
we
saw
but
thrice
a
week
once
every
saturday
afternoon
when
attended
by
two
ushers
we
were
permitted
to
take
brief
walks
in
a
body
through
some
of
the
neighboring
fields
and
twice
during
sunday
when
we
were
paraded
in
the
same
formal
manner
to
the
morning
and
evening
service
in
the
one
church
of
the
village
of
this
church
the
principal
of
our
school
was
pastor
with
how
deep
a
spirit
of
wonder
and
perplexity
was
i
wont
to
regard
him
from
our
remote
pew
in
the
gallery
as
with
step
solemn
and
slow
he
ascended
the
pulpit
this
reverend
man
with
countenance
so
demurely
benign
with
robes
so
glossy
and
so
clerically
flowing
with
wig
so
minutely
powdered
so
rigid
and
so
vast
could
this
be
he
who
of
late
with
sour
visage
and
in
snuffy
habiliments
administered
ferule
in
hand
the
draconian
laws
of
the
academy
oh
gigantic
paradox
too
utterly
monstrous
for
solution
at
an
angle
of
the
ponderous
wall
frowned
a
more
ponderous
gate
it
was
riveted
and
studded
with
iron
bolts
and
surmounted
with
jagged
iron
spikes
what
impressions
of
deep
awe
did
it
inspire
it
was
never
opened
save
for
the
three
periodical
egressions
and
ingressions
already
mentioned
then
in
every
creak
of
its
mighty
hinges
we
found
a
plenitude
of
mystery
a
world
of
matter
for
solemn
remark
or
for
more
solemn
meditation
the
extensive
enclosure
was
irregular
in
form
having
many
capacious
recesses
of
these
three
or
four
of
the
largest
constituted
the
it
was
level
and
covered
with
fine
hard
gravel
i
well
remember
it
had
no
trees
nor
benches
nor
anything
similar
within
it
of
course
it
was
in
the
rear
of
the
house
in
front
lay
a
small
parterre
planted
with
box
and
other
shrubs
but
through
this
sacred
division
we
passed
only
upon
rare
occasions
indeed
such
as
a
first
advent
to
school
or
final
departure
thence
or
perhaps
when
a
parent
or
friend
having
called
for
us
we
joyfully
took
our
way
home
for
the
christmas
or
midsummer
holidays
but
the
house
how
quaint
an
old
building
was
this
to
me
how
veritably
a
palace
of
enchantment
there
was
really
no
end
to
its
windings
to
its
incomprehensible
subdivisions
it
was
difficult
at
any
given
time
to
say
with
certainty
upon
which
of
its
two
stories
one
happened
to
be
from
each
room
to
every
other
there
were
sure
to
be
found
three
or
four
steps
either
in
ascent
or
descent
then
the
lateral
branches
were
innumerable
inconceivable
and
so
returning
in
upon
themselves
that
our
most
exact
ideas
in
regard
to
the
whole
mansion
were
not
very
far
different
from
those
with
which
we
pondered
upon
infinity
during
the
five
years
of
my
residence
here
i
was
never
able
to
ascertain
with
precision
in
what
remote
locality
lay
the
little
sleeping
apartment
assigned
to
myself
and
some
eighteen
or
twenty
other
scholars
the
was
the
largest
in
the
house
i
could
not
help
thinking
in
the
world
it
was
very
long
narrow
and
dismally
low
with
pointed
gothic
windows
and
a
ceiling
of
oak
in
a
remote
and
angle
was
a
square
enclosure
of
eight
or
ten
feet
comprising
the
during
hours
of
our
principal
the
reverend
bransby
it
was
a
solid
structure
with
massy
door
sooner
than
open
which
in
the
absence
of
the
dominie
we
would
all
have
willingly
perished
by
the
forte
et
in
other
angles
were
two
other
similar
boxes
far
less
reverenced
indeed
but
still
greatly
matters
of
awe
one
of
these
was
the
pulpit
of
the
classical
usher
one
of
the
english
and
mathematical
interspersed
about
the
room
crossing
and
recrossing
in
endless
irregularity
were
innumerable
benches
and
desks
black
ancient
and
piled
desperately
with
books
and
so
beseamed
with
initial
letters
names
at
full
length
grotesque
figures
and
other
multiplied
efforts
of
the
knife
as
to
have
entirely
lost
what
little
of
original
form
might
have
been
their
portion
in
days
long
departed
a
huge
bucket
with
water
stood
at
one
extremity
of
the
room
and
a
clock
of
stupendous
dimensions
at
the
other
encompassed
by
the
massy
walls
of
this
venerable
academy
i
passed
yet
not
in
tedium
or
disgust
the
years
of
the
third
lustrum
of
my
life
the
teeming
brain
of
childhood
requires
no
external
world
of
incident
to
occupy
or
amuse
it
and
the
apparently
dismal
monotony
of
a
school
was
replete
with
more
intense
excitement
than
my
riper
youth
has
derived
from
luxury
or
my
full
manhood
from
crime
yet
i
must
believe
that
my
first
mental
development
had
in
it
much
of
the
uncommon
even
much
of
the
upon
mankind
at
large
the
events
of
very
early
existence
rarely
leave
in
mature
age
any
definite
impression
all
is
gray
shadow
a
weak
and
irregular
remembrance
an
indistinct
regathering
of
feeble
pleasures
and
phantasmagoric
pains
with
me
this
is
not
so
in
childhood
i
must
have
felt
with
the
energy
of
a
man
what
i
now
find
stamped
upon
memory
in
lines
as
vivid
as
deep
and
as
durable
as
the
of
the
carthaginian
medals
yet
in
fact
in
the
fact
of
the
world
view
how
little
was
there
to
remember
the
morning
awakening
the
nightly
summons
to
bed
the
connings
the
recitations
the
periodical
and
perambulations
the
with
its
broils
its
pastimes
its
intrigues
these
by
a
mental
sorcery
long
forgotten
were
made
to
involve
a
wilderness
of
sensation
a
world
of
rich
incident
an
universe
of
varied
emotion
of
excitement
the
most
passionate
and
le
bon
temps
que
ce
siècle
de
fer
in
truth
the
ardor
the
enthusiasm
and
the
imperiousness
of
my
disposition
soon
rendered
me
a
marked
character
among
my
schoolmates
and
by
slow
but
natural
gradations
gave
me
an
ascendancy
over
all
not
greatly
older
than
myself
over
all
with
a
single
exception
this
exception
was
found
in
the
person
of
a
scholar
who
although
no
relation
bore
the
same
christian
and
surname
as
myself
a
circumstance
in
fact
little
remarkable
for
notwithstanding
a
noble
descent
mine
was
one
of
those
appellations
which
seem
by
prescriptive
right
to
have
been
time
out
of
mind
the
common
property
of
the
mob
in
this
narrative
i
have
therefore
designated
myself
as
william
wilson
a
fictitious
title
not
very
dissimilar
to
the
real
my
namesake
alone
of
those
who
in
constituted
our
set
presumed
to
compete
with
me
in
the
studies
of
the
class
in
the
sports
and
broils
of
the
to
refuse
implicit
belief
in
my
assertions
and
submission
to
my
will
indeed
to
interfere
with
my
arbitrary
dictation
in
any
respect
whatsoever
if
there
is
on
earth
a
supreme
and
unqualified
despotism
it
is
the
despotism
of
a
in
boyhood
over
the
less
energetic
spirits
of
its
companions
wilson
rebellion
was
to
me
a
source
of
the
greatest
embarrassment
the
more
so
as
in
spite
of
the
bravado
with
which
in
public
i
made
a
point
of
treating
him
and
his
pretensions
i
secretly
felt
that
i
feared
him
and
could
not
help
thinking
the
equality
which
he
maintained
so
easily
with
myself
a
proof
of
his
true
superiority
since
not
to
be
overcome
cost
me
a
perpetual
struggle
yet
this
superiority
even
this
equality
was
in
truth
acknowledged
by
no
one
but
myself
our
associates
by
some
unaccountable
blindness
seemed
not
even
to
suspect
it
indeed
his
competition
his
resistance
and
especially
his
impertinent
and
dogged
interference
with
my
purposes
were
not
more
pointed
than
private
he
appeared
to
be
destitute
alike
of
the
ambition
which
urged
and
of
the
passionate
energy
of
mind
which
enabled
me
to
excel
in
his
rivalry
he
might
have
been
supposed
actuated
solely
by
a
whimsical
desire
to
thwart
astonish
or
mortify
myself
although
there
were
times
when
i
could
not
help
observing
with
a
feeling
made
up
of
wonder
abasement
and
pique
that
he
mingled
with
his
injuries
his
insults
or
his
contradictions
a
certain
most
inappropriate
and
assuredly
most
unwelcome
of
manner
i
could
only
conceive
this
singular
behavior
to
arise
from
a
consummate
assuming
the
vulgar
airs
of
patronage
and
protection
perhaps
it
was
this
latter
trait
in
wilson
conduct
conjoined
with
our
identity
of
name
and
the
mere
accident
of
our
having
entered
the
school
upon
the
same
day
which
set
afloat
the
notion
that
we
were
brothers
among
the
senior
classes
in
the
academy
these
do
not
usually
inquire
with
much
strictness
into
the
affairs
of
their
juniors
i
have
before
said
or
should
have
said
that
wilson
was
not
in
the
most
remote
degree
connected
with
my
family
but
assuredly
if
we
been
brothers
we
must
have
been
twins
for
after
leaving
bransby
i
cassually
learned
that
my
namesake
was
born
on
the
nineteenth
of
january
and
this
is
a
somewhat
remarkable
coincidence
for
the
day
is
precisely
that
of
my
own
nativity
it
may
seem
strange
that
in
spite
of
the
continual
anxiety
occasioned
me
by
the
rivalry
of
wilson
and
his
intolerable
spirit
of
contradiction
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
hate
him
altogether
we
had
to
be
sure
nearly
every
day
a
quarrel
in
which
yielding
me
publicly
the
palm
of
victory
he
in
some
manner
contrieved
to
make
me
feel
that
it
was
he
who
had
deserved
it
yet
a
sense
of
pride
on
my
part
and
a
veritable
dignity
on
his
own
kept
us
always
upon
what
are
called
speaking
terms
while
there
were
many
points
of
strong
congeniality
in
our
tempers
operating
to
awake
in
me
a
sentiment
which
our
position
alone
perhaps
prevented
from
ripening
into
friendship
it
is
difficult
indeed
to
define
or
even
to
describe
my
real
feelings
towards
him
they
formed
a
motley
and
heterogeneous
admixture
some
petulant
animosity
which
was
not
yet
hatred
some
esteem
more
respect
much
fear
with
a
world
of
uneasy
curiosity
to
the
moralist
it
will
be
unnecessary
to
say
in
addition
that
wilson
and
myself
were
the
most
inseparable
of
companions
it
was
no
doubt
the
anomalous
state
of
affairs
existing
between
us
which
turned
all
my
attacks
upon
him
and
they
were
many
either
open
or
covert
into
the
channel
of
banter
or
practical
joke
giving
pain
while
assuming
the
aspect
of
mere
fun
rather
than
into
a
more
serious
and
determined
hostility
but
my
endeavors
on
this
head
were
by
no
means
uniformly
successful
even
when
my
plans
were
the
most
wittily
concocted
for
my
namesake
had
much
about
him
in
character
of
that
unassuming
and
quiet
austerity
which
while
enjoying
the
poignancy
of
its
own
jokes
has
no
heel
of
achilles
in
itself
and
absolutely
refuses
to
be
laughed
at
i
could
find
indeed
but
one
vulnerable
point
and
that
lying
in
a
personal
peculiarity
arising
perhaps
from
constitutional
disease
would
have
been
spared
by
any
antagonist
less
at
his
wit
end
than
myself
my
rival
had
a
weakness
in
the
faucial
or
guttural
organs
which
precluded
him
from
raising
his
voice
at
any
time
a
very
low
of
this
defect
i
did
not
fail
to
take
what
poor
advantage
lay
in
my
power
wilson
retaliations
in
kind
were
many
and
there
was
one
form
of
his
practical
wit
that
disturbed
me
beyond
measure
how
his
sagacity
first
discovered
at
all
that
so
petty
a
thing
would
vex
me
is
a
question
i
never
could
solve
but
having
discovered
he
habitually
practised
the
annoyance
i
had
always
felt
aversion
to
my
uncourtly
patronymic
and
its
very
common
if
not
plebeian
praenomen
the
words
were
venom
in
my
ears
and
when
upon
the
day
of
my
arrival
a
second
william
wilson
came
also
to
the
academy
i
felt
angry
with
him
for
bearing
the
name
and
doubly
disgusted
with
the
name
because
a
stranger
bore
it
who
would
be
the
cause
of
its
twofold
repetition
who
would
be
constantly
in
my
presence
and
whose
concerns
in
the
ordinary
routine
of
the
school
business
must
inevitably
on
account
of
the
detestable
coincidence
be
often
confounded
with
my
own
the
feeling
of
vexation
thus
engendered
grew
stronger
with
every
circumstance
tending
to
show
resemblance
moral
or
physical
between
my
rival
and
myself
i
had
not
then
discovered
the
remarkable
fact
that
we
were
of
the
same
age
but
i
saw
that
we
were
of
the
same
height
and
i
perceived
that
we
were
even
singularly
alike
in
general
contour
of
person
and
outline
of
feature
i
was
galled
too
by
the
rumor
touching
a
relationship
which
had
grown
current
in
the
upper
forms
in
a
word
nothing
could
more
seriously
disturb
me
although
i
scrupulously
concealed
such
disturbance
than
any
allusion
to
a
similarity
of
mind
person
or
condition
existing
between
us
but
in
truth
i
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
with
the
exception
of
the
matter
of
relationship
and
in
the
case
of
wilson
himself
this
similarity
had
ever
been
made
a
subject
of
comment
or
even
observed
at
all
by
our
schoolfellows
that
observed
it
in
all
its
bearings
and
as
fixedly
as
i
was
apparent
but
that
he
could
discover
in
such
circumstances
so
fruitful
a
field
of
annoyance
can
only
be
attributed
as
i
said
before
to
his
more
than
ordinary
penetration
his
cue
which
was
to
perfect
an
imitation
of
myself
lay
both
in
words
and
in
actions
and
most
admirably
did
he
play
his
part
my
dress
it
was
an
easy
matter
to
copy
my
gait
and
general
manner
were
without
difficulty
appropriated
in
spite
of
his
constitutional
defect
even
my
voice
did
not
escape
him
my
louder
tones
were
of
course
unattempted
but
then
the
key
it
was
identical
his
singular
whisper
it
grew
the
very
echo
of
my
how
greatly
this
most
exquisite
portraiture
harassed
me
for
it
could
not
justly
be
termed
a
caricature
i
will
not
now
venture
to
describe
i
had
but
one
consolation
in
the
fact
that
the
imitation
apparently
was
noticed
by
myself
alone
and
that
i
had
to
endure
only
the
knowing
and
strangely
sarcastic
smiles
of
my
namesake
himself
satisfied
with
having
produced
in
my
bosom
the
intended
effect
he
seemed
to
chuckle
in
secret
over
the
sting
he
had
inflicted
and
was
uncharacteristically
disregardful
of
the
public
applause
which
the
success
of
his
witty
endeavours
might
have
so
easily
elicited
that
the
school
indeed
did
not
feel
his
design
perceive
its
accomplishment
and
participate
in
his
sneer
was
for
many
anxious
months
a
riddle
i
could
not
resolve
perhaps
the
of
his
copy
rendered
it
not
so
readily
perceptible
or
more
possibly
i
owed
my
security
to
the
masterly
air
of
the
copyist
who
disdaining
the
letter
which
in
a
painting
is
all
the
obtuse
can
see
gave
but
the
full
spirit
of
his
original
for
my
individual
contemplation
and
chagrin
i
have
already
more
than
once
spoken
of
the
disgusting
air
of
patronage
which
he
assumed
toward
me
and
of
his
frequent
officious
interference
with
my
will
this
interference
often
took
the
ungracious
character
of
advice
advice
not
openly
given
but
hinted
or
insinuated
i
received
it
with
a
repugnance
which
gained
strength
as
i
grew
in
years
yet
at
this
distant
day
let
me
do
him
the
simple
justice
to
acknowledge
that
i
can
recall
no
occasion
when
the
suggestions
of
my
rival
were
on
the
side
of
those
errors
or
follies
so
usual
to
his
immature
age
and
seeming
inexperience
that
his
moral
sense
at
least
if
not
his
general
talents
and
worldly
wisdom
was
far
keener
than
my
own
and
that
i
might
have
been
a
better
and
thus
a
happier
man
had
i
less
frequently
rejected
the
counsels
embodied
in
those
meaning
whispers
which
i
then
but
too
cordially
hated
and
too
bitterly
despised
as
it
was
i
at
length
grew
restive
in
the
extreme
under
his
distasteful
supervision
and
daily
resented
more
and
more
openly
what
i
considered
his
intolerable
arrogance
i
have
said
that
in
the
first
years
of
our
connection
as
schoolmates
my
feelings
in
regard
to
him
might
have
been
easily
ripened
into
friendship
but
in
the
latter
months
of
my
residence
at
the
academy
although
the
intrusion
of
his
ordinary
manner
had
beyond
doubt
in
some
measure
abated
my
sentiments
in
nearly
similar
proportion
partook
very
much
of
positive
hatred
upon
one
occasion
he
saw
this
i
think
and
afterwards
avoided
or
made
a
show
of
avoiding
me
it
was
about
the
same
period
if
i
remember
aright
that
in
an
altercation
of
violence
with
him
in
which
he
was
more
than
usually
thrown
off
his
guard
and
spoke
and
acted
with
an
openness
of
demeanor
rather
foreign
to
his
nature
i
discovered
or
fancied
i
discovered
in
his
accent
his
air
and
general
appearance
a
something
which
first
startled
and
then
deeply
interested
me
by
bringing
to
mind
dim
visions
of
my
earliest
infancy
wild
confused
and
thronging
memories
of
a
time
when
memory
herself
was
yet
unborn
i
can
not
better
describe
the
sensation
which
oppressed
me
than
by
saying
that
i
could
with
difficulty
shake
off
the
belief
of
my
having
been
acquainted
with
the
being
who
stood
before
me
at
some
epoch
very
long
ago
some
point
of
the
past
even
infinitely
remote
the
delusion
however
faded
rapidly
as
it
came
and
i
mention
it
at
all
but
to
define
the
day
of
the
last
conversation
i
there
held
with
my
singular
namesake
the
huge
old
house
with
its
countless
subdivisions
had
several
large
chambers
communicating
with
each
other
where
slept
the
greater
number
of
the
students
there
were
however
as
must
necessarily
happen
in
a
building
so
awkwardly
planned
many
little
nooks
or
recesses
the
odds
and
ends
of
the
structure
and
these
the
economic
ingenuity
of
bransby
had
also
fitted
up
as
dormitories
although
being
the
merest
closets
they
were
capable
of
accommodating
but
a
single
individual
one
of
these
small
apartments
was
occupied
by
wilson
one
night
about
the
close
of
my
fifth
year
at
the
school
and
immediately
after
the
altercation
just
mentioned
finding
every
one
wrapped
in
sleep
i
arose
from
bed
and
lamp
in
hand
stole
through
a
wilderness
of
narrow
passages
from
my
own
bedroom
to
that
of
my
rival
i
had
long
been
plotting
one
of
those
pieces
of
practical
wit
at
his
expense
in
which
i
had
hitherto
been
so
uniformly
unsuccessful
it
was
my
intention
now
to
put
my
scheme
in
operation
and
i
resolved
to
make
him
feel
the
whole
extent
of
the
malice
with
which
i
was
imbued
having
reached
his
closet
i
noiselessly
entered
leaving
the
lamp
with
a
shade
over
it
on
the
outside
i
advanced
a
step
and
listened
to
the
sound
of
his
tranquil
breathing
assured
of
his
being
asleep
i
returned
took
the
light
and
with
it
again
approached
the
bed
close
curtains
were
around
it
which
in
the
prosecution
of
my
plan
i
slowly
and
quietly
withdrew
when
the
bright
rays
fell
vividly
upon
the
sleeper
and
my
eyes
at
the
same
moment
upon
his
countenance
i
looked
and
a
numbness
an
iciness
of
feeling
instantly
pervaded
my
frame
my
breast
heaved
my
knees
tottered
my
whole
spirit
became
possessed
with
an
objectless
yet
intolerable
horror
gasping
for
breath
i
lowered
the
lamp
in
still
nearer
proximity
to
the
face
were
these
the
lineaments
of
william
wilson
i
saw
indeed
that
they
were
his
but
i
shook
as
if
with
a
fit
of
the
ague
in
fancying
they
were
not
what
there
about
them
to
confound
me
in
this
manner
i
gazed
while
my
brain
reeled
with
a
multitude
of
incoherent
thoughts
not
thus
he
appeared
assuredly
not
in
the
vivacity
of
his
waking
hours
the
same
name
the
same
contour
of
person
the
same
day
of
arrival
at
the
academy
and
then
his
dogged
and
meaningless
imitation
of
my
gait
my
voice
my
habits
and
my
manner
was
it
in
truth
within
the
bounds
of
human
possibility
that
i
now
was
the
result
merely
of
the
habitual
practice
of
this
sarcastic
imitation
and
with
a
creeping
shudder
i
extinguished
the
lamp
passed
silently
from
the
chamber
and
left
at
once
the
halls
of
that
old
academy
never
to
enter
them
again
after
a
lapse
of
some
months
spent
at
home
in
mere
idleness
i
found
myself
a
student
at
eton
the
brief
interval
had
been
sufficient
to
enfeeble
my
remembrance
of
the
events
at
bransby
or
at
least
to
effect
a
material
change
in
the
nature
of
the
feelings
with
which
i
remembered
them
the
truth
the
tragedy
of
the
drama
was
no
more
i
could
now
find
room
to
doubt
the
evidence
of
my
senses
and
seldom
called
up
the
subject
at
all
but
with
wonder
at
the
extent
of
human
credulity
and
a
smile
at
the
vivid
force
of
the
imagination
which
i
hereditarily
possessed
neither
was
this
species
of
scepticism
likely
to
be
diminished
by
the
character
of
the
life
i
led
at
eton
the
vortex
of
thoughtless
folly
into
which
i
there
so
immediately
and
so
recklessly
plunged
washed
away
all
but
the
froth
of
my
past
hours
engulfed
at
once
every
solid
or
serious
impression
and
left
to
memory
only
the
veriest
levities
of
a
former
existence
i
do
not
wish
however
to
trace
the
course
of
my
miserable
profligacy
here
a
profligacy
which
set
at
defiance
the
laws
while
it
eluded
the
vigilance
of
the
institution
three
years
of
folly
passed
without
profit
had
but
given
me
rooted
habits
of
vice
and
added
in
a
somewhat
unusual
degree
to
my
bodily
stature
when
after
a
week
of
soulless
dissipation
i
invited
a
small
party
of
the
most
dissolute
students
to
a
secret
carousal
in
my
chambers
we
met
at
a
late
hour
of
the
night
for
our
debaucheries
were
to
be
faithfully
protracted
until
morning
the
wine
flowed
freely
and
there
were
not
wanting
other
and
perhaps
more
dangerous
seductions
so
that
the
gray
dawn
had
already
faintly
appeared
in
the
east
while
our
delirious
extravagance
was
at
its
height
madly
flushed
with
cards
and
intoxication
i
was
in
the
act
of
insisting
upon
a
toast
of
more
than
wonted
profanity
when
my
attention
was
suddenly
diverted
by
the
violent
although
partial
unclosing
of
the
door
of
the
apartment
and
by
the
eager
voice
of
a
servant
from
without
he
said
that
some
person
apparently
in
great
haste
demanded
to
speak
with
me
in
the
hall
wildly
excited
with
wine
the
unexpected
interruption
rather
delighted
than
surprised
me
i
staggered
forward
at
once
and
a
few
steps
brought
me
to
the
vestibule
of
the
building
in
this
low
and
small
room
there
hung
no
lamp
and
now
no
light
at
all
was
admitted
save
that
of
the
exceedingly
feeble
dawn
which
made
its
way
through
the
semicircular
window
as
i
put
my
foot
over
the
threshold
i
became
aware
of
the
figure
of
a
youth
about
my
own
height
and
habited
in
a
white
kerseymere
morning
frock
cut
in
the
novel
fashion
of
the
one
i
myself
wore
at
the
moment
this
the
faint
light
enabled
me
to
perceive
but
the
features
of
his
face
i
could
not
distinguish
upon
my
entering
he
strode
hurriedly
up
to
me
and
seizing
me
by
the
arm
with
a
gesture
of
petulant
impatience
whispered
the
words
william
wilson
in
my
ear
i
grew
perfectly
sober
in
an
instant
there
was
that
in
the
manner
of
the
stranger
and
in
the
tremulous
shake
of
his
uplifted
finger
as
he
held
it
between
my
eyes
and
the
light
which
filled
me
with
unqualified
amazement
but
it
was
not
this
which
had
so
violently
moved
me
it
was
the
pregnancy
of
solemn
admonition
in
the
singular
low
hissing
utterance
and
above
all
it
was
the
character
the
tone
of
those
few
simple
and
familiar
yet
syllables
which
came
with
a
thousand
thronging
memories
of
days
and
struck
upon
my
soul
with
the
shock
of
a
galvanic
battery
ere
i
could
recover
the
use
of
my
senses
he
was
gone
although
this
event
failed
not
of
a
vivid
effect
upon
my
disordered
imagination
yet
was
it
evanescent
as
vivid
for
some
weeks
indeed
i
busied
myself
in
earnest
inquiry
or
was
wrapped
in
a
cloud
of
morbid
speculation
i
did
not
pretend
to
disguise
from
my
perception
the
identity
of
the
singular
individual
who
thus
perseveringly
interfered
with
my
affairs
and
harassed
me
with
his
insinuated
counsel
but
who
and
what
was
this
wilson
and
whence
came
he
and
what
were
his
purposes
upon
neither
of
these
points
could
i
be
satisfied
merely
ascertaining
in
regard
to
him
that
a
sudden
accident
in
his
family
had
caused
his
removal
from
bransby
academy
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
in
which
i
myself
had
eloped
but
in
a
brief
period
i
ceased
to
think
upon
the
subject
my
attention
being
all
absorbed
in
a
contemplated
departure
for
oxford
thither
i
soon
went
the
uncalculating
vanity
of
my
parents
furnishing
me
with
an
outfit
and
annual
establishment
which
would
enable
me
to
indulge
at
will
in
the
luxury
already
so
dear
to
my
hear
to
vie
in
profuseness
of
expenditure
with
the
haughtiest
heirs
of
the
wealthiest
earldoms
in
great
britain
excited
by
such
appliances
to
vice
my
constitutional
temperament
broke
forth
with
redoubled
ardor
and
i
spurned
even
the
common
restraints
of
decency
in
the
mad
infatuation
of
my
revels
but
it
were
absurd
to
pause
in
the
detail
of
my
extravagance
let
it
suffice
that
among
spendthrifts
i
herod
and
that
giving
name
to
a
multitude
of
novel
follies
i
added
no
brief
appendix
to
the
long
catalogue
of
vices
then
usual
in
the
most
dissolute
university
of
europe
it
could
hardly
be
credited
however
that
i
had
even
here
so
utterly
fallen
from
the
gentlemanly
estate
as
to
seek
acquaintance
with
the
vilest
arts
of
the
gambler
by
profession
and
having
become
an
adept
in
his
despicable
science
to
practise
it
habitually
as
a
means
of
increasing
my
already
enormous
income
at
the
expense
of
the
among
my
such
nevertheless
was
the
fact
and
the
very
enormity
of
this
offence
against
all
manly
and
honorable
sentiment
proved
beyond
doubt
the
main
if
not
the
sole
reason
of
the
impunity
with
which
it
was
committed
who
indeed
among
my
most
abandoned
associates
would
not
rather
have
disputed
the
clearest
evidence
of
his
senses
than
have
suspected
of
such
courses
the
gay
the
frank
the
generous
william
wilson
the
noblest
and
most
liberal
commoner
at
oxford
him
whose
follies
said
his
parasites
were
but
the
follies
of
youth
and
unbridled
fancy
whose
errors
but
inimitable
whim
whose
darkest
vice
but
a
careless
and
dashing
extravagance
i
had
been
now
two
years
successfully
busied
in
this
way
when
there
came
to
the
university
a
young
nobleman
glendinning
rich
said
report
as
herodes
atticus
his
riches
too
as
easily
acquired
i
soon
found
him
of
weak
intellect
and
of
course
marked
him
as
a
fitting
subject
for
my
skill
i
frequently
engaged
him
in
play
and
contrived
with
the
gambler
usual
art
to
let
him
win
considerable
sums
the
more
effectually
to
entangle
him
in
my
snares
at
length
my
schemes
being
ripe
i
met
him
with
the
full
intention
that
this
meeting
should
be
final
and
decisive
at
the
chambers
of
a
preston
equally
intimate
with
both
but
who
to
do
him
justice
entertained
not
even
a
remote
suspicion
of
my
design
to
give
to
this
a
better
coloring
i
had
contrived
to
have
assembled
a
party
of
some
eight
or
ten
and
was
solicitously
careful
that
the
introduction
of
cards
should
appear
accidental
and
originate
in
the
proposal
of
my
contemplated
dupe
himself
to
be
brief
upon
a
vile
topic
none
of
the
low
finesse
was
omitted
so
customary
upon
similar
occasions
that
it
is
a
just
matter
for
wonder
how
any
are
still
found
so
besotted
as
to
fall
its
victim
we
had
protracted
our
sitting
far
into
the
night
and
i
had
at
length
effected
the
manoeuvre
of
getting
glendinning
as
my
sole
antagonist
the
game
too
was
my
favorite
the
rest
of
the
company
interested
in
the
extent
of
our
play
had
abandoned
their
own
cards
and
were
standing
around
us
as
spectators
the
who
had
been
induced
by
my
artifices
in
the
early
part
of
the
evening
to
drink
deeply
now
shuffled
dealt
or
played
with
a
wild
nervousness
of
manner
for
which
his
intoxication
i
thought
might
partially
but
could
not
altogether
account
in
a
very
short
period
he
had
become
my
debtor
to
a
large
amount
when
having
taken
a
long
draught
of
port
he
did
precisely
what
i
had
been
coolly
anticipating
he
proposed
to
double
our
already
extravagant
stakes
with
a
show
of
reluctance
and
not
until
after
my
repeated
refusal
had
seduced
him
into
some
angry
words
which
gave
a
color
of
pique
to
my
compliance
did
i
finally
comply
the
result
of
course
did
but
prove
how
entirely
the
prey
was
in
my
toils
in
less
than
an
hour
he
had
quadrupled
his
debt
for
some
time
his
countenance
had
been
losing
the
florid
tinge
lent
it
by
the
wine
but
now
to
my
astonishment
i
perceived
that
it
had
grown
to
a
pallor
truly
fearful
i
say
to
my
astonishment
glendinning
had
been
represented
to
my
eager
inquiries
as
immeasurably
wealthy
and
the
sums
which
he
had
as
yet
lost
although
in
themselves
vast
could
not
i
supposed
very
seriously
annoy
much
less
so
violently
affect
him
that
he
was
overcome
by
the
wine
just
swallowed
was
the
idea
which
most
readily
presented
itself
and
rather
with
a
view
to
the
preservation
of
my
own
character
in
the
eyes
of
my
associates
than
from
any
less
interested
motive
i
was
about
to
insist
peremptorily
upon
a
discontinuance
of
the
play
when
some
expressions
at
my
elbow
from
among
the
company
and
an
ejaculation
evincing
utter
despair
on
the
part
of
glendinning
gave
me
to
understand
that
i
had
effected
his
total
ruin
under
circumstances
which
rendering
him
an
object
for
the
pity
of
all
should
have
protected
him
from
the
ill
offices
even
of
a
fiend
what
now
might
have
been
my
conduct
it
is
difficult
to
say
the
pitiable
condition
of
my
dupe
had
thrown
an
air
of
embarrassed
gloom
over
all
and
for
some
moments
a
profound
silence
was
maintained
during
which
i
could
not
help
feeling
my
cheeks
tingle
with
the
many
burning
glances
of
scorn
or
reproach
cast
upon
me
by
the
less
abandoned
of
the
party
i
will
even
own
that
an
intolerable
weight
of
anxiety
was
for
a
brief
instant
lifted
from
my
bosom
by
the
sudden
and
extraordinary
interruption
which
ensued
the
wide
heavy
of
the
apartment
were
all
at
once
thrown
open
to
their
full
extent
with
a
vigorous
and
rushing
impetuosity
that
extinguished
as
if
by
magic
every
candle
in
the
room
their
light
in
dying
enabled
us
just
to
perceive
that
a
stranger
had
entered
about
my
own
height
and
closely
muffled
in
a
cloak
the
darkness
however
was
now
total
and
we
could
only
that
he
was
standing
in
our
midst
before
any
one
of
us
could
recover
from
the
extreme
astonishment
into
which
this
rudeness
had
thrown
all
we
heard
the
voice
of
the
intruder
gentlemen
he
said
in
a
low
distinct
and
which
thrilled
to
the
very
marrow
of
my
bones
gentlmen
i
make
no
apology
for
this
behavior
because
in
thus
behaving
i
am
but
fulfilling
a
duty
you
are
beyond
doubt
uninformed
of
the
true
character
of
the
person
who
has
won
at
a
large
sum
of
money
from
lord
glendinning
i
will
therefore
put
you
upon
an
expeditious
and
decisive
plan
of
obtaining
this
very
necessary
information
please
to
examine
at
your
leisure
the
inner
linings
of
the
cuff
of
his
left
sleeve
and
the
several
little
packages
which
may
be
found
in
the
somewhat
capacious
pockets
of
his
embroidered
morning
wrapper
while
he
spoke
so
profound
was
the
stillness
that
one
might
have
heard
a
pin
drop
upon
the
floor
in
ceasing
he
departed
at
once
and
as
abruptly
as
he
had
entered
can
i
shall
i
describe
my
sensations
must
i
say
that
i
felt
all
the
horrors
of
the
damned
most
assuredly
i
had
little
time
for
reflection
many
hands
roughly
seized
me
upon
the
spot
and
lights
were
immediately
a
search
ensued
in
the
lining
of
my
sleeve
were
found
all
the
court
cards
essential
in
and
in
the
pockets
of
my
wrapper
a
number
of
packs
facsimiles
of
those
used
at
our
sittings
with
the
single
exception
that
mine
were
of
the
species
called
technically
the
honors
being
slightly
convex
at
the
ends
the
lower
cards
slightly
convex
at
the
sides
in
this
disposition
the
dupe
who
cuts
as
customary
at
the
length
of
the
pack
will
invariably
find
that
he
cuts
his
antagonist
an
honor
while
the
gambler
cutting
at
the
breadth
will
as
certainly
cut
nothing
for
his
victim
which
may
count
in
the
records
of
the
game
any
burst
of
indignation
upon
this
discovery
would
have
affected
me
less
than
the
silent
contempt
or
the
sarcastic
composure
with
which
it
was
received
wilson
said
our
host
stooping
to
remove
from
beneath
his
feet
an
exceedingly
luxurious
cloak
of
rare
furs
wilson
this
is
your
property
the
weather
was
cold
and
upon
quitting
my
own
room
i
had
thrown
a
cloak
over
my
dressing
wrapper
putting
it
off
upon
reaching
the
scene
of
play
i
presume
it
is
supererogatory
to
seek
here
eying
the
folds
of
the
garment
with
a
bitter
smile
for
any
farther
evidence
of
your
skill
indeed
we
have
had
enough
you
will
see
the
necessity
i
hope
of
quitting
oxford
at
all
events
of
quitting
instantly
my
chambers
abased
humbled
to
the
dust
as
i
then
was
it
is
probable
that
i
should
have
resented
this
galling
language
by
immediate
personal
violence
had
not
my
whole
attention
been
at
the
moment
arrested
by
a
fact
of
the
most
startling
character
the
cloak
which
i
had
worn
was
of
a
rare
description
of
fur
how
rare
how
extravagantly
costly
i
shall
not
venture
to
say
its
fashion
too
was
of
my
own
fantastic
invention
for
i
was
fastidious
to
an
absurd
degree
of
coxcombry
in
matters
of
this
frivolous
nature
when
therefore
preston
reached
me
that
which
he
had
picked
up
upon
the
floor
and
near
the
of
the
apartment
it
was
with
an
astonishment
nearly
bordering
upon
terror
that
i
perceived
my
own
already
hanging
on
my
arm
where
i
had
no
doubt
unwittingly
placed
it
and
that
the
one
presented
me
was
but
its
exact
counterpart
in
every
in
even
the
minutest
possible
particular
the
singular
being
who
had
so
disastrously
exposed
me
had
been
muffled
i
remembered
in
a
cloak
and
none
had
been
worn
at
all
by
any
of
the
members
of
our
party
with
the
exception
of
myself
retaining
some
presence
of
mind
i
took
the
one
offered
me
by
preston
placed
it
unnoticed
over
my
own
left
the
apartment
with
a
resolute
scowl
of
defiance
and
next
morning
ere
dawn
of
day
commenced
a
hurried
journey
from
oxford
to
the
continent
in
a
perfect
agony
of
horror
and
of
shame
fled
in
my
evil
destiny
pursued
me
as
if
in
exultation
and
proved
indeed
that
the
exercise
of
its
mysterious
dominion
had
as
yet
only
begun
scarcely
had
i
set
foot
in
paris
ere
i
had
fresh
evidence
of
the
detestable
interest
taken
by
this
wilson
in
my
concerns
years
flew
while
i
experienced
no
relief
villain
at
rome
with
how
untimely
yet
with
how
spectral
an
officiousness
stepped
he
in
between
me
and
my
ambition
at
vienna
too
at
berlin
and
at
moscow
where
in
truth
had
i
bitter
cause
to
curse
him
within
my
heart
from
his
inscrutable
tyranny
did
i
at
length
flee
as
from
a
pestilence
and
to
the
very
ends
of
the
earth
fled
in
and
again
and
again
in
secret
communion
with
my
own
spirit
would
i
demand
the
questions
who
is
he
whence
came
he
and
what
are
his
objects
but
no
answer
was
there
found
and
now
i
scrutinized
with
a
minute
scrutiny
the
forms
and
the
methods
and
the
leading
traits
of
his
impertinent
supervision
but
even
here
there
was
very
little
upon
which
to
base
a
conjecture
it
was
noticeable
indeed
that
in
no
one
of
the
multiplied
instances
in
which
he
had
of
late
crossed
my
path
had
he
so
crossed
it
except
to
frustrate
those
schemes
or
to
disturb
those
actions
which
if
fully
carried
out
might
have
resulted
in
bitter
mischief
poor
justification
this
in
truth
for
an
authority
so
imperiously
assumed
poor
indemnity
for
natural
rights
of
so
pertinaciously
so
insultingly
denied
i
had
also
been
forced
to
notice
that
my
tormentor
for
a
very
long
period
of
time
while
scrupulously
and
with
miraculous
dexterity
maintaining
his
whim
of
an
identity
of
apparel
with
myself
had
so
contrived
it
in
the
execution
of
his
varied
interference
with
my
will
that
i
saw
not
at
any
moment
the
features
of
his
face
be
wilson
what
he
might
at
least
was
but
the
veriest
of
affectation
or
of
folly
could
he
for
an
instant
have
supposed
that
in
my
admonisher
at
eton
in
the
destroyer
of
my
honor
at
oxford
in
him
who
thwarted
my
ambition
at
rome
my
revenge
at
paris
my
passionate
love
at
naples
or
what
he
falsely
termed
my
avarice
in
egypt
that
in
this
my
and
evil
genius
i
could
fail
to
recognize
the
william
wilson
of
my
schoolboy
days
the
namesake
the
companion
the
rival
the
hated
and
dreaded
rival
at
bransby
impossible
but
let
me
hasten
to
the
last
eventful
scene
of
the
drama
thus
far
i
had
succumbed
suginely
to
this
imperious
domination
the
sentiment
of
deep
awe
with
which
i
habitually
regarded
the
elevated
character
the
majestic
wisdom
the
apparent
omnipresence
and
omnipotence
of
wilson
added
to
a
feeling
of
even
terror
with
which
certain
other
traits
in
his
nature
and
assumptions
inspired
me
had
operated
hitherto
to
impress
me
with
an
idea
of
my
own
utter
weakness
and
helplessness
and
to
suggest
an
implicit
although
bitterly
reluctant
submission
to
his
arbitrary
will
but
of
late
days
i
had
given
myself
up
entirely
to
wine
and
its
maddening
influence
upon
my
hereditary
temper
rendered
me
more
and
more
impatient
of
control
i
began
to
murmur
to
hesitate
to
resist
and
was
it
only
fancy
which
induced
me
to
believe
that
with
the
increase
of
my
own
firmness
that
of
my
tormentor
underwent
a
proportional
diminution
be
this
as
it
may
i
now
began
to
feel
the
inspiration
of
a
burning
hope
and
at
length
nurtured
in
my
secret
thoughts
a
stern
and
desperate
resolution
that
i
would
submit
no
longer
to
be
enslaved
it
was
at
rome
during
the
carnival
of
that
i
attended
a
masquerade
in
the
palazzo
of
the
neapolitan
duke
di
broglio
i
had
indulged
more
freely
than
usual
in
the
excesses
of
the
and
now
the
suffocating
atmosphere
of
the
crowded
rooms
irritated
me
beyond
endurance
the
difficulty
too
of
forcing
my
way
through
the
mazes
of
the
company
contributed
not
a
little
to
the
ruffling
of
my
temper
for
i
was
anxiously
seeking
let
me
not
say
with
what
unworthy
motive
the
young
the
gay
the
beautiful
wife
of
the
aged
and
doting
di
broglio
with
a
too
unscrupulous
confidence
she
had
previously
communicated
to
me
the
secret
of
the
costume
in
which
she
would
be
habited
and
now
having
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
person
i
was
hurrying
to
make
my
way
into
her
presence
at
this
moment
i
felt
a
light
hand
placed
upon
my
shoulder
and
that
low
damnable
within
my
ear
in
an
absolute
frenzy
of
wrath
i
turned
at
once
upon
him
who
had
thus
interrupted
me
and
seized
him
violently
by
the
collar
he
was
attired
as
i
had
expected
in
a
costume
altogether
similar
to
my
own
wearing
a
spanish
cloak
of
blue
velvet
begirt
about
the
waist
with
a
crimson
belt
sustaining
a
rapier
a
mask
of
black
silk
entirely
covered
his
face
scoundrel
i
said
in
a
voice
husky
with
rage
while
every
syllable
i
uttered
seemed
as
new
fuel
to
my
fury
scoundrel
impostor
accursed
villain
you
shall
not
you
dog
me
unto
death
follow
me
or
i
stab
you
where
you
stand
and
i
broke
my
way
from
the
into
a
small
adjoining
dragging
him
unresistingly
with
me
as
i
went
upon
entering
i
thrust
him
furiously
from
me
he
staggered
against
the
wall
while
i
closed
the
door
with
an
oath
and
commanded
him
to
draw
he
hesitated
but
for
an
instant
then
with
a
slight
sigh
drew
in
silence
and
put
himself
upon
his
defence
the
contest
was
brief
indeed
i
was
frantic
with
every
species
of
wild
excitement
and
felt
within
my
single
arm
the
energy
and
power
of
a
multitude
in
a
few
seconds
i
forced
him
by
sheer
strength
against
the
wainscoting
and
thus
getting
him
at
mercy
plunged
my
sword
with
brute
ferocity
repeatedly
through
and
through
his
bosom
at
that
instant
some
person
tried
the
latch
of
the
door
i
hastened
to
prevent
an
intrusion
and
then
immediately
returned
to
my
dying
antagonist
but
what
human
language
can
adequately
portray
astonishment
horror
which
possessed
me
at
the
spectacle
then
presented
to
view
the
brief
moment
in
which
i
averted
my
eyes
had
been
sufficient
to
produce
apparently
a
material
change
in
the
arrangements
at
the
upper
or
farther
end
of
the
room
a
large
mirror
so
at
first
it
seemed
to
me
in
my
confusion
now
stood
where
none
had
been
perceptible
before
and
as
i
stepped
up
to
it
in
extremity
of
terror
mine
own
image
but
with
features
all
pale
and
dabbled
in
blood
advanced
to
meet
me
with
a
feeble
and
tottering
gait
thus
it
appeared
i
say
but
was
not
it
was
my
antagonist
it
was
wilson
who
then
stood
before
me
in
the
agonies
of
his
dissolution
his
mask
and
cloak
lay
where
he
had
thrown
them
upon
the
floor
not
a
thread
in
all
his
raiment
not
a
line
in
all
the
marked
and
singular
lineaments
of
his
face
which
was
not
even
in
the
most
absolute
identity
it
was
wilson
but
he
spoke
no
longer
in
a
whisper
and
i
could
have
fancied
that
i
myself
was
speaking
while
he
said
you
have
conquered
and
i
yield
yet
henceforward
art
thou
also
dead
dead
to
the
world
to
heaven
and
to
hope
in
me
didst
thou
exist
and
in
my
death
see
by
this
image
which
is
thine
own
how
utterly
thou
hast
murdered
thyself
a
descent
into
the
maelström
the
ways
of
god
in
nature
as
in
providence
are
not
as
ways
nor
are
the
models
that
we
frame
any
way
commensurate
to
the
vastness
profundity
and
unsearchableness
of
his
works
have
a
depth
in
them
greater
than
the
well
of
joseph
glanville
we
had
now
reached
the
summit
of
the
loftiest
crag
for
some
minutes
the
old
man
seemed
too
much
exhausted
to
speak
not
long
ago
said
he
at
length
and
i
could
have
guided
you
on
this
route
as
well
as
the
youngest
of
my
sons
but
about
three
years
past
there
happened
to
me
an
event
such
as
never
happened
before
to
mortal
man
or
at
least
such
as
no
man
ever
survived
to
tell
of
and
the
six
hours
of
deadly
terror
which
i
then
endured
have
broken
me
up
body
and
soul
you
suppose
me
a
old
man
but
i
am
not
it
took
less
than
a
single
day
to
change
these
hairs
from
a
jetty
black
to
white
to
weaken
my
limbs
and
to
unstring
my
nerves
so
that
i
tremble
at
the
least
exertion
and
am
frightened
at
a
shadow
do
you
know
i
can
scarcely
look
over
this
little
cliff
without
getting
giddy
the
little
cliff
upon
whose
edge
he
had
so
carelessly
thrown
himself
down
to
rest
that
the
weightier
portion
of
his
body
hung
over
it
while
he
was
only
kept
from
falling
by
the
tenure
of
his
elbow
on
its
extreme
and
slippery
edge
this
little
cliff
arose
a
sheer
unobstructed
precipice
of
black
shining
rock
some
fifteen
or
sixteen
hundred
feet
from
the
world
of
crags
beneath
us
nothing
would
have
tempted
me
to
within
half
a
dozen
yards
of
its
brink
in
truth
so
deeply
was
i
excited
by
the
perilous
position
of
my
companion
that
i
fell
at
full
length
upon
the
ground
clung
to
the
shrubs
around
me
and
dared
not
even
glance
upward
at
the
sky
while
i
struggled
in
vain
to
divest
myself
of
the
idea
that
the
very
foundations
of
the
mountain
were
in
danger
from
the
fury
of
the
winds
it
was
long
before
i
could
reason
myself
into
sufficient
courage
to
sit
up
and
look
out
into
the
distance
you
must
get
over
these
fancies
said
the
guide
for
i
have
brought
you
here
that
you
might
have
the
best
possible
view
of
the
scene
of
that
event
i
mentioned
and
to
tell
you
the
whole
story
with
the
spot
just
under
your
eye
we
are
now
he
continued
in
that
particularizing
manner
which
distinguished
him
we
are
now
close
upon
the
norwegian
coast
in
the
degree
of
latitude
in
the
great
province
of
nordland
and
in
the
dreary
district
of
lofoden
the
mountain
upon
whose
top
we
sit
is
helseggen
the
cloudy
now
raise
yourself
up
a
little
higher
hold
on
to
the
grass
if
you
feel
giddy
so
and
look
out
beyond
the
belt
of
vapor
beneath
us
into
the
sea
i
looked
dizzily
and
beheld
a
wide
expanse
of
ocean
whose
waters
wore
so
inky
a
hue
as
to
bring
at
once
to
my
mind
the
nubian
geographer
account
of
the
a
panorama
more
deplorably
desolate
no
human
imagination
can
conceive
to
the
right
and
left
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
there
lay
outstretched
like
ramparts
of
the
world
lines
of
horridly
black
and
beetling
cliff
whose
character
of
gloom
was
but
the
more
forcibly
illustrated
by
the
surf
which
reared
high
up
against
it
its
white
and
ghastly
crest
howling
and
shrieking
forever
just
opposite
the
promontory
upon
whose
apex
we
were
placed
and
at
a
distance
of
some
five
or
six
miles
out
at
sea
there
was
visible
a
small
island
or
more
properly
its
position
was
discernible
through
the
wilderness
of
surge
in
which
it
was
enveloped
about
two
miles
nearer
the
land
arose
another
of
smaller
size
hideously
craggy
and
barren
and
encompassed
at
various
intervals
by
a
cluster
of
dark
rocks
the
appearance
of
the
ocean
in
the
space
between
the
more
distant
island
and
the
shore
had
something
very
unusual
about
it
although
at
the
time
so
strong
a
gale
was
blowing
landward
that
a
brig
in
the
remote
offing
lay
to
under
a
trysail
and
constantly
plunged
her
whole
hull
out
of
sight
still
there
was
here
nothing
like
a
regular
swell
but
only
a
short
quick
angry
cross
dashing
of
water
in
every
direction
as
well
in
the
teeth
of
the
wind
as
otherwise
of
foam
there
was
little
except
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
rocks
the
island
in
the
distance
resumed
the
old
man
is
called
by
the
norwegians
vurrgh
the
one
midway
is
moskoe
that
a
mile
to
the
northward
is
ambaaren
yonder
are
iflesen
hoeyholm
kieldholm
suarven
and
buckholm
farther
off
between
moskoe
and
vurrgh
are
otterholm
flimen
sandflesen
and
skarholm
these
are
the
true
names
of
the
places
but
why
it
has
been
thought
necessary
to
name
them
at
all
is
more
than
either
you
or
i
can
understand
do
you
hear
anything
do
you
see
any
change
in
the
water
we
had
now
been
about
ten
minutes
upon
the
top
of
helseggen
to
which
we
had
ascended
from
the
interior
of
lofoden
so
that
we
had
caught
no
glimpse
of
the
sea
until
it
had
burst
upon
us
from
the
summit
as
the
old
man
spoke
i
became
aware
of
a
loud
and
gradually
increasing
sound
like
the
moaning
of
a
vast
herd
of
buffaloes
upon
an
american
prairie
and
at
the
same
moment
i
perceived
that
what
seamen
term
the
character
of
the
ocean
beneath
us
was
rapidly
changing
into
a
current
which
set
to
the
eastward
even
while
i
gazed
this
current
acquired
a
monstrous
velocity
each
moment
added
to
its
speed
to
its
headlong
impetuosity
in
five
minutes
the
whole
sea
as
far
as
vurrgh
was
lashed
into
ungovernable
fury
but
it
was
between
moskoe
and
the
coast
that
the
main
uproar
held
its
sway
here
the
vast
bed
of
the
waters
seamed
and
scarred
into
a
thousand
conflicting
channels
burst
suddenly
into
frenzied
convulsion
heaving
boiling
hissing
gyrating
in
gigantic
and
innumerable
vortices
and
all
whirling
and
plunging
on
to
the
eastward
with
a
rapidity
which
water
never
elsewhere
assumes
except
in
precipitous
descents
in
a
few
minutes
more
there
came
over
the
scene
another
radical
alteration
the
general
surface
grew
somewhat
more
smooth
and
the
whirlpools
one
by
one
disappeared
while
prodigious
streaks
of
foam
became
apparent
where
none
had
been
seen
before
these
streaks
at
length
spreading
out
to
a
great
distance
and
entering
into
combination
took
unto
themselves
the
gyratory
motion
of
the
subsided
vortices
and
seemed
to
form
the
germ
of
another
more
vast
suddenly
very
suddenly
this
assumed
a
distinct
and
definite
existence
in
a
circle
of
more
than
a
mile
in
diameter
the
edge
of
the
whirl
was
represented
by
a
broad
belt
of
gleaming
spray
but
no
particle
of
this
slipped
into
the
mouth
of
the
terrific
funnel
whose
interior
as
far
as
the
eye
could
fathom
it
was
a
smooth
shining
and
wall
of
water
inclined
to
the
horizon
at
an
angle
of
some
degrees
speeding
dizzily
round
and
round
with
a
swaying
and
sweltering
motion
and
sending
forth
to
the
winds
an
appalling
voice
half
shriek
half
roar
such
as
not
even
the
mighty
cataract
of
niagara
ever
lifts
up
in
its
agony
to
heaven
the
mountain
trembled
to
its
very
base
and
the
rock
rocked
i
threw
myself
upon
my
face
and
clung
to
the
scant
herbage
in
an
excess
of
nervous
agitation
this
said
i
at
length
to
the
old
man
this
be
nothing
else
than
the
great
whirlpool
of
the
maelström
so
it
is
sometimes
termed
said
he
we
norwegians
call
it
the
from
the
island
of
moskoe
in
the
midway
the
ordinary
accounts
of
this
vortex
had
by
no
means
prepared
me
for
what
i
saw
that
of
jonas
ramus
which
is
perhaps
the
most
circumstantial
of
any
can
not
impart
the
faintest
conception
either
of
the
magnificence
or
of
the
horror
of
the
scene
or
of
the
wild
bewildering
sense
of
which
confounds
the
beholder
i
am
not
sure
from
what
point
of
view
the
writer
in
question
surveyed
it
nor
at
what
time
but
it
could
neither
have
been
from
the
summit
of
helseggen
nor
during
a
storm
there
are
some
passages
of
his
description
nevertheless
which
may
be
quoted
for
their
details
although
their
effect
is
exceedingly
feeble
in
conveying
an
impression
of
the
spectacle
between
lofoden
and
moskoe
he
says
the
depth
of
the
water
is
between
and
forty
fathoms
but
on
the
other
side
toward
ver
vurrgh
this
depth
decreases
so
as
not
to
afford
a
convenient
passage
for
a
vessel
without
the
risk
of
splitting
on
the
rocks
which
happens
even
in
the
calmest
weather
when
it
is
flood
the
stream
runs
up
the
country
between
lofoden
and
moskoe
with
a
boisterous
rapidity
but
the
roar
of
its
impetuous
ebb
to
the
sea
is
scarce
equalled
by
the
loudest
and
most
dreadful
cataracts
the
noise
being
heard
several
leagues
off
and
the
vortices
or
pits
are
of
such
an
extent
and
depth
that
if
a
ship
comes
within
its
attraction
it
is
inevitably
absorbed
and
carried
down
to
the
bottom
and
there
beat
to
pieces
against
the
rocks
and
when
the
water
relaxes
the
fragments
thereof
are
thrown
up
again
but
these
intervals
of
tranquillity
are
only
at
the
turn
of
the
ebb
and
flood
and
in
calm
weather
and
last
but
a
quarter
of
an
hour
its
violence
gradually
returning
when
the
stream
is
most
boisterous
and
its
fury
heightened
by
a
storm
it
is
dangerous
to
come
within
a
norway
mile
of
it
boats
yachts
and
ships
have
been
carried
away
by
not
guarding
against
it
before
they
were
within
its
reach
it
likewise
happens
frequently
that
whales
come
too
near
the
stream
and
are
overpowered
by
its
violence
and
then
it
is
impossible
to
describe
their
howlings
and
bellowings
in
their
fruitless
struggles
to
disengage
themselves
a
bear
once
attempting
to
swim
from
lofoden
to
moskoe
was
caught
by
the
stream
and
borne
down
while
he
roared
terribly
so
as
to
be
heard
on
shore
large
stocks
of
firs
and
pine
trees
after
being
absorbed
by
the
current
rise
again
broken
and
torn
to
such
a
degree
as
if
bristles
grew
upon
them
this
plainly
shows
the
bottom
to
consist
of
craggy
rocks
among
which
they
are
whirled
to
and
fro
this
stream
is
regulated
by
the
flux
and
reflux
of
the
sea
it
being
constantly
high
and
low
water
every
six
hours
in
the
year
early
in
the
morning
of
sexagesima
sunday
it
raged
with
such
noise
and
impetuosity
that
the
very
stones
of
the
houses
on
the
coast
fell
to
the
ground
in
regard
to
the
depth
of
the
water
i
could
not
see
how
this
could
have
been
ascertained
at
all
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
vortex
the
forty
fathoms
must
have
reference
only
to
portions
of
the
channel
close
upon
the
shore
either
of
moskoe
or
lofoden
the
depth
in
the
centre
of
the
must
be
immeasurably
greater
and
no
better
proof
of
this
fact
is
necessary
than
can
be
obtained
from
even
the
sidelong
glance
into
the
abyss
of
the
whirl
which
may
be
had
from
the
highest
crag
of
helseggen
looking
down
from
this
pinnacle
upon
the
howling
phlegethon
below
i
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
simplicity
with
which
the
honest
jonas
ramus
records
as
a
matter
difficult
of
belief
the
anecdotes
of
the
whales
and
the
bears
for
it
appeared
to
me
in
fact
a
thing
that
the
largest
ships
of
the
line
in
existence
coming
within
the
influence
of
that
deadly
attraction
could
resist
it
as
little
as
a
feather
the
hurricane
and
must
disappear
bodily
and
at
once
the
attempts
to
account
for
the
phenomenon
some
of
which
i
remember
seemed
to
me
sufficiently
plausible
in
perusal
now
wore
a
very
different
and
unsatisfactory
aspect
the
idea
generally
received
is
that
this
as
well
as
three
smaller
vortices
among
the
feroe
islands
have
no
other
cause
than
the
collision
of
waves
rising
and
falling
at
flux
and
reflux
against
a
ridge
of
rocks
and
shelves
which
confines
the
water
so
that
it
precipitates
itself
like
a
cataract
and
thus
the
higher
the
flood
rises
the
deeper
must
the
fall
be
and
the
natural
result
of
all
is
a
whirlpool
or
vortex
the
prodigious
suction
of
which
is
sufficiently
known
by
lesser
experiments
these
are
the
words
of
the
encyclopædia
britannica
kircher
and
others
imagine
that
in
the
centre
of
the
channel
of
the
maelström
is
an
abyss
penetrating
the
globe
and
issuing
in
some
very
remote
part
the
gulf
of
bothnia
being
somewhat
decidedly
named
in
one
instance
this
opinion
idle
in
itself
was
the
one
to
which
as
i
gazed
my
imagination
most
readily
assented
and
mentioning
it
to
the
guide
i
was
rather
surprised
to
hear
him
say
that
although
it
was
the
view
almost
universally
entertained
of
the
subject
by
the
norwegians
it
nevertheless
was
not
his
own
as
to
the
former
notion
he
confessed
his
inability
to
comprehend
it
and
here
i
agreed
with
him
for
however
conclusive
on
paper
it
becomes
altogether
unintelligible
and
even
absurd
amid
the
thunder
of
the
abyss
you
have
had
a
good
look
at
the
whirl
now
said
the
old
man
and
if
you
will
creep
round
this
crag
so
as
to
get
in
its
lee
and
deaden
the
roar
of
the
water
i
will
tell
you
a
story
that
will
convince
you
i
ought
to
know
something
of
the
i
placed
myself
as
desired
and
he
proceeded
myself
and
my
two
brothers
once
owned
a
smack
of
about
seventy
tons
burden
with
which
we
were
in
the
habit
of
fishing
among
the
islands
beyond
moskoe
nearly
to
vurrgh
in
all
violent
eddies
at
sea
there
is
good
fishing
at
proper
opportunities
if
one
has
only
the
courage
to
attempt
it
but
among
the
whole
of
the
lofoden
coastmen
we
three
were
the
only
ones
who
made
a
regular
business
of
going
out
to
the
islands
as
i
tell
you
the
usual
grounds
are
a
great
way
lower
down
to
the
southward
there
fish
can
be
got
at
all
hours
without
much
risk
and
therefore
these
places
are
preferred
the
choice
spots
over
here
among
the
rocks
however
not
only
yield
the
finest
variety
but
in
far
greater
abundance
so
that
we
often
got
in
a
single
day
what
the
more
timid
of
the
craft
could
not
scrape
together
in
a
week
in
fact
we
made
it
a
matter
of
desperate
speculation
the
risk
of
life
standing
instead
of
labor
and
courage
answering
for
capital
we
kept
the
smack
in
a
cove
about
five
miles
higher
up
the
coast
than
this
and
it
was
our
practice
in
fine
weather
to
take
advantage
of
the
fifteen
minutes
slack
to
push
across
the
main
channel
of
the
far
above
the
pool
and
then
drop
down
upon
anchorage
somewhere
near
otterholm
or
sandflesen
where
the
eddies
are
not
so
violent
as
elsewhere
here
we
used
to
remain
until
nearly
time
for
again
when
we
weighed
and
made
for
home
we
never
set
out
upon
this
expedition
without
a
steady
side
wind
for
going
and
coming
one
that
we
felt
sure
would
not
fail
us
before
our
return
and
we
seldom
made
a
miscalculation
upon
this
point
twice
during
six
years
we
were
forced
to
stay
all
night
at
anchor
on
account
of
a
dead
calm
which
is
a
rare
thing
indeed
just
about
here
and
once
we
had
to
remain
on
the
grounds
nearly
a
week
starving
to
death
owing
to
a
gale
which
blew
up
shortly
after
our
arrival
and
made
the
channel
too
boisterous
to
be
thought
of
upon
this
occasion
we
should
have
been
driven
out
to
sea
in
spite
of
everything
for
the
whirlpools
threw
us
round
and
round
so
violently
that
at
length
we
fouled
our
anchor
and
dragged
it
if
it
had
not
been
that
we
drifted
into
one
of
the
innumerable
cross
currents
here
and
gone
which
drove
us
under
the
lee
of
flimen
where
by
good
luck
we
brought
up
i
could
not
tell
you
the
twentieth
part
of
the
difficulties
we
encountered
the
ground
it
is
a
bad
spot
to
be
in
even
in
good
weather
but
we
made
shift
always
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
the
itself
without
accident
although
at
times
my
heart
has
been
in
my
mouth
when
we
happened
to
be
a
minute
or
so
behind
or
before
the
slack
the
wind
sometimes
was
not
as
strong
as
we
thought
it
at
starting
and
then
we
made
rather
less
way
than
we
could
wish
while
the
current
rendered
the
smack
unmanageable
my
eldest
brother
had
a
son
eighteen
years
old
and
i
had
two
stout
boys
of
my
own
these
would
have
been
of
great
assistance
at
such
times
in
using
the
sweeps
as
well
as
afterward
in
fishing
but
somehow
although
we
ran
the
risk
ourselves
we
had
not
the
heart
to
let
the
young
ones
get
into
the
danger
for
after
all
said
and
done
it
a
horrible
danger
and
that
is
the
truth
it
is
now
within
a
few
days
of
three
years
since
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
occurred
it
was
on
the
tenth
of
july
a
day
which
the
people
of
this
part
of
the
world
will
never
forget
for
it
was
one
in
which
blew
the
most
terrible
hurricane
that
ever
came
out
of
the
heavens
and
yet
all
the
morning
and
indeed
until
late
in
the
afternoon
there
was
a
gentle
and
steady
breeze
from
the
while
the
sun
shone
brightly
so
that
the
oldest
seamen
among
us
could
not
have
forseen
what
was
to
follow
the
three
of
us
my
two
brothers
and
myself
had
crossed
over
to
the
islands
about
two
and
soon
nearly
loaded
the
smack
with
fine
fish
which
we
all
remarked
were
more
plenty
that
day
than
we
had
ever
known
them
it
was
just
seven
my
watch
when
we
weighed
and
started
for
home
so
as
to
make
the
worst
of
the
ström
at
slack
water
which
we
knew
would
be
at
eight
we
set
out
with
a
fresh
wind
on
our
starboard
quarter
and
for
some
time
spanked
along
at
a
great
rate
never
dreaming
of
danger
for
indeed
we
saw
not
the
slightest
reason
to
apprehend
it
all
at
once
we
were
taken
aback
by
a
breeze
from
over
helseggen
this
was
most
unusual
something
that
had
never
happened
to
us
before
and
i
began
to
feel
a
little
uneasy
without
exactly
knowing
why
we
put
the
boat
on
the
wind
but
could
make
no
headway
at
all
for
the
eddies
and
i
was
upon
the
point
of
proposing
to
return
to
the
anchorage
when
looking
astern
we
saw
the
whole
horizon
covered
with
a
singular
cloud
that
rose
with
the
most
amazing
velocity
in
the
meantime
the
breeze
that
had
headed
us
off
fell
away
and
we
were
dead
becalmed
drifting
about
in
every
direction
this
state
of
things
however
did
not
last
long
enough
to
give
us
time
to
think
about
it
in
less
than
a
minute
the
storm
was
upon
us
in
less
than
two
the
sky
was
entirely
overcast
and
what
with
this
and
the
driving
spray
it
became
suddenly
so
dark
that
we
could
not
see
each
other
in
the
smack
such
a
hurricane
as
then
blew
it
is
folly
to
attempt
describing
the
oldest
seaman
in
norway
never
experienced
anything
like
it
we
had
let
our
sails
go
by
the
run
before
it
cleverly
took
us
but
at
the
first
puff
both
our
masts
went
by
the
board
as
if
they
had
been
sawed
off
the
mainmast
taking
with
it
my
youngest
brother
who
had
lashed
himself
to
it
for
safety
our
boat
was
the
lightest
feather
of
a
thing
that
ever
sat
upon
water
it
had
a
complete
flush
deck
with
only
a
small
hatch
near
the
bow
and
this
hatch
it
had
always
been
our
custom
to
batten
down
when
about
to
cross
the
ström
by
way
of
precaution
against
the
chopping
seas
but
for
this
circumstance
we
should
have
foundered
at
once
for
we
lay
entirely
buried
for
some
moments
how
my
elder
brother
escaped
destruction
i
can
not
say
for
i
never
had
an
opportunity
of
ascertaining
for
my
part
as
soon
as
i
had
let
the
foresail
run
i
threw
myself
flat
on
deck
with
my
feet
against
the
narrow
gunwale
of
the
bow
and
with
my
hands
grasping
a
near
the
foot
of
the
foremast
it
was
mere
instinct
that
prompted
me
to
do
this
which
was
undoubtedly
the
very
best
thing
i
could
have
done
for
i
was
too
much
flurried
to
think
for
some
moments
we
were
completely
deluged
as
i
say
and
all
this
time
i
held
my
breath
and
clung
to
the
bolt
when
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
i
raised
myself
upon
my
knees
still
keeping
hold
with
my
hands
and
thus
got
my
head
clear
presently
our
little
boat
gave
herself
a
shake
just
as
a
dog
does
in
coming
out
of
the
water
and
thus
rid
herself
in
some
measure
of
the
seas
i
was
now
trying
to
get
the
better
of
the
stupor
that
had
come
over
me
and
to
collect
my
senses
so
as
to
see
what
was
to
be
done
when
i
felt
somebody
grasp
my
arm
it
was
my
elder
brother
and
my
heart
leaped
for
joy
for
i
had
made
sure
that
he
was
overboard
but
the
next
moment
all
this
joy
was
turned
into
horror
for
he
put
his
mouth
close
to
my
ear
and
screamed
out
the
word
no
ever
know
what
my
feelings
were
at
that
moment
i
shook
from
head
to
foot
as
if
i
had
had
the
most
violent
fit
of
the
ague
i
knew
what
he
meant
by
that
one
word
well
enough
i
knew
what
he
wished
to
make
me
understand
with
the
wind
that
now
drove
us
on
we
were
bound
for
the
whirl
of
the
ström
and
nothing
could
save
us
you
perceive
that
in
crossing
the
ström
we
always
went
a
long
way
up
above
the
whirl
even
in
the
calmest
weather
and
then
had
to
wait
and
watch
carefully
for
the
slack
but
now
we
were
driving
right
upon
the
pool
itself
and
in
such
a
hurricane
as
this
be
sure
i
thought
shall
get
there
just
about
the
slack
there
is
some
little
hope
in
that
but
in
the
next
moment
i
cursed
myself
for
being
so
great
a
fool
as
to
dream
of
hope
at
all
i
knew
very
well
that
we
were
doomed
had
we
been
ten
times
a
ship
by
this
time
the
first
fury
of
the
tempest
had
spent
itself
or
perhaps
we
did
not
feel
it
so
much
as
we
scudded
before
it
but
at
all
events
the
seas
which
at
first
had
been
kept
down
by
the
wind
and
lay
flat
and
frothing
now
got
up
into
absolute
mountains
a
singular
change
too
had
come
over
the
heavens
around
in
every
direction
it
was
still
as
black
as
pitch
but
nearly
overhead
there
burst
out
all
at
once
a
circular
rift
of
clear
sky
as
clear
as
i
ever
saw
and
of
a
deep
bright
blue
and
through
it
there
blazed
forth
the
full
moon
with
a
lustre
that
i
never
before
knew
her
to
wear
she
lit
up
everything
about
us
with
the
greatest
distinctness
but
oh
god
what
a
scene
it
was
to
light
up
i
now
made
one
or
two
attempts
to
speak
to
my
brother
but
in
some
manner
which
i
could
not
understand
the
din
had
so
increased
that
i
could
not
make
him
hear
a
single
word
although
i
screamed
at
the
top
of
my
voice
in
his
ear
presently
he
shook
his
head
looking
as
pale
as
death
and
held
up
one
of
his
fingers
as
if
to
say
at
first
i
could
not
make
out
what
he
meant
but
soon
a
hideous
thought
flashed
upon
me
i
dragged
my
watch
from
its
fob
it
was
not
going
i
glanced
at
its
face
by
the
moonlight
and
then
burst
into
tears
as
i
flung
it
far
away
into
the
ocean
had
run
down
at
seven
we
were
behind
the
time
of
the
slack
and
the
whirl
of
the
ström
was
in
full
fury
when
a
boat
is
well
built
properly
trimmed
and
not
deep
laden
the
waves
in
a
strong
gale
when
she
is
going
large
seem
always
to
slip
from
beneath
her
which
appears
very
strange
to
a
landsman
and
this
is
what
is
called
in
sea
phrase
well
so
far
we
had
ridden
the
swells
very
cleverly
but
presently
a
gigantic
sea
happened
to
take
us
right
under
the
counter
and
bore
us
with
it
as
it
rose
up
up
as
if
into
the
sky
i
would
not
have
believed
that
any
wave
could
rise
so
high
and
then
down
we
came
with
a
sweep
a
slide
and
a
plunge
that
made
me
feel
sick
and
dizzy
as
if
i
was
falling
from
some
lofty
in
a
dream
but
while
we
were
up
i
had
thrown
a
quick
glance
around
and
that
one
glance
was
all
sufficient
i
saw
our
exact
position
in
an
instant
the
whirlpool
was
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
dead
ahead
but
no
more
like
the
than
the
whirl
as
you
now
see
it
is
like
a
if
i
had
not
known
where
we
were
and
what
we
had
to
expect
i
should
not
have
recognized
the
place
at
all
as
it
was
i
involuntarily
closed
my
eyes
in
horror
the
lids
clenched
themselves
together
as
if
in
a
spasm
it
could
not
have
been
more
than
two
minutes
afterwards
until
we
suddenly
felt
the
waves
subside
and
were
enveloped
in
foam
the
boat
made
a
sharp
half
turn
to
larboard
and
then
shot
off
in
its
new
direction
like
a
thunderbolt
at
the
same
moment
the
roaring
noise
of
the
water
was
completely
drowned
in
a
kind
of
shrill
shriek
such
a
sound
as
you
might
imagine
given
out
by
the
of
many
thousand
letting
off
their
steam
all
together
we
were
now
in
the
belt
of
surf
that
always
surrounds
the
whirl
and
i
thought
of
course
that
another
moment
would
plunge
us
into
the
abyss
down
which
we
could
only
see
indistinctly
on
account
of
the
amazing
velocity
with
which
we
were
borne
along
the
boat
did
not
seem
to
sink
into
the
water
at
all
but
to
skim
like
an
upon
the
surface
of
the
surge
her
starboard
side
was
next
the
whirl
and
on
the
larboard
arose
the
world
of
ocean
we
had
left
it
stood
like
a
huge
writhing
wall
between
us
and
the
horizon
it
may
appear
strange
but
now
when
we
were
in
the
very
jaws
of
the
gulf
i
felt
more
composed
than
when
we
were
only
approaching
it
having
made
up
my
mind
to
hope
no
more
i
got
rid
of
a
great
deal
of
that
terror
which
unmanned
me
at
first
i
suppose
it
was
despair
that
strung
my
nerves
it
may
look
like
boasting
but
what
i
tell
you
is
truth
i
began
to
reflect
how
magnificent
a
thing
it
was
to
die
in
such
a
manner
and
how
foolish
it
was
in
me
to
think
of
so
paltry
a
consideration
as
my
own
individual
life
in
view
of
so
wonderful
a
manifestation
of
power
i
do
believe
that
i
blushed
with
shame
when
this
idea
crossed
my
mind
after
a
little
while
i
became
possessed
with
the
keenest
curiosity
about
the
whirl
itself
i
positively
felt
a
to
explore
its
depths
even
at
the
sacrifice
i
was
going
to
make
and
my
principal
grief
was
that
i
should
never
be
able
to
tell
my
old
companions
on
shore
about
the
mysteries
i
should
see
these
no
doubt
were
singular
fancies
to
occupy
a
man
mind
in
such
extremity
and
i
have
often
thought
since
that
the
revolutions
of
the
boat
around
the
pool
might
have
rendered
me
a
little
there
was
another
circumstance
which
tended
to
restore
my
and
this
was
the
cessation
of
the
wind
which
could
not
reach
us
in
our
present
situation
for
as
you
saw
yourself
the
belt
of
surf
is
considerably
lower
than
the
general
bed
of
the
ocean
and
this
latter
now
towered
above
us
a
high
black
mountainous
ridge
if
you
have
never
been
at
sea
in
a
heavy
gale
you
can
form
no
idea
of
the
confusion
of
mind
occasioned
by
the
wind
and
spray
together
they
blind
deafen
and
strangle
you
and
take
away
all
power
of
action
or
reflection
but
we
were
now
in
a
great
measure
rid
of
these
annoyances
just
as
felons
in
prison
are
allowed
petty
indulgences
forbidden
them
while
their
doom
is
yet
uncertain
how
often
we
made
the
circuit
of
the
belt
it
is
impossible
to
say
we
careered
round
and
round
for
perhaps
an
hour
flying
rather
than
floating
getting
gradually
more
and
more
into
the
middle
of
the
surge
and
then
nearer
and
nearer
to
its
horrible
inner
edge
all
this
time
i
had
never
let
go
of
the
my
brother
was
at
stern
holding
on
to
a
small
empty
which
had
been
securely
lashed
under
the
coop
of
the
counter
and
was
the
only
thing
on
deck
that
had
not
been
swept
overboard
when
the
gale
first
took
us
as
we
approached
the
brink
of
the
pit
he
let
go
his
hold
upon
this
and
made
for
the
ring
from
which
in
the
agony
of
his
terror
he
endeavored
to
force
my
hands
as
it
was
not
large
enough
to
afford
us
both
a
secure
grasp
i
never
felt
deeper
grief
than
when
i
saw
him
attempt
this
act
although
i
new
he
was
a
madman
when
he
did
it
a
raving
maniac
through
sheer
fright
i
did
not
care
however
to
contest
the
point
with
him
i
knew
it
could
make
no
diference
whether
either
of
us
held
on
at
all
so
i
let
him
have
the
bolt
and
went
astern
to
the
cask
this
there
was
no
great
difficulty
in
doing
for
the
smack
flew
round
steadily
enough
and
upon
an
even
keel
only
swaying
to
and
fro
with
the
immense
sweeps
and
swelters
of
the
whirl
scarcely
had
i
secured
myself
in
my
new
position
when
we
gave
a
wild
lurch
to
starboard
and
rushed
headlong
into
the
abyss
i
muttered
a
hurried
prayer
to
god
and
thought
all
was
over
as
i
felt
the
sickening
sweep
of
the
descent
i
had
instinctively
tightened
my
hold
upon
the
barrel
and
closed
my
eyes
for
some
seconds
i
dared
not
open
them
while
i
expected
instant
destruction
and
wondered
that
i
was
not
already
in
my
with
the
water
but
moment
after
moment
elapsed
i
still
lived
the
sense
of
falling
had
ceased
and
the
motion
of
the
vessel
seemed
much
as
it
had
been
before
while
in
the
belt
of
foam
with
the
exception
that
she
now
lay
more
along
i
took
courage
and
looked
once
again
upon
the
scene
never
shall
i
forget
the
sensations
of
awe
horror
and
admiration
with
which
i
gazed
about
me
the
boat
appeared
to
be
hanging
as
if
by
magic
midway
down
upon
the
interior
surface
of
a
funnel
vast
in
circumference
prodigious
in
depth
and
whose
perfectly
smooth
sides
might
have
been
mistaken
for
ebony
but
for
the
bewildering
rapidity
with
which
they
spun
around
and
for
the
gleaming
and
ghastly
radiance
they
shot
forth
as
the
rays
of
the
full
moon
from
that
circular
rift
amid
the
clouds
which
i
have
already
described
streamed
in
a
flood
of
golden
glory
along
the
black
walls
and
far
away
down
into
the
inmost
recesses
of
the
abyss
at
first
i
was
too
much
confused
to
observe
anything
accurately
the
general
burst
of
terrific
grandeur
was
all
that
i
beheld
when
i
recovered
myself
a
little
however
my
gaze
fell
instinctively
downward
in
this
direction
i
was
able
to
obtain
an
unobstructed
view
from
the
manner
in
which
the
smack
hung
on
the
inclined
surface
of
the
pool
she
was
quite
upon
an
even
keel
that
is
to
say
her
deck
lay
in
a
plane
parallel
with
that
of
the
water
but
this
latter
sloped
at
an
angle
of
more
than
degrees
so
that
we
seemed
to
be
lying
upon
our
i
could
not
help
observing
nevertheless
that
i
had
scarcely
more
difficulty
in
maintaining
my
hold
and
footing
in
this
situation
than
if
we
had
been
upon
a
dead
level
and
this
i
suppose
was
owing
to
the
speed
at
which
we
revolved
the
rays
of
the
moon
seemed
to
search
the
very
bottom
of
the
profound
gulf
but
still
i
could
make
out
nothing
distinctly
on
account
of
a
thick
mist
in
which
everything
there
was
enveloped
and
over
which
there
hung
a
magnificent
rainbow
like
that
narrow
and
tottering
bridge
which
mussulmans
say
is
the
only
pathway
between
time
and
eternity
this
mist
or
spray
was
no
doubt
occasioned
by
the
clashing
of
the
great
walls
of
the
funnel
as
they
all
met
together
at
the
bottom
but
the
yell
that
went
up
to
the
heavens
from
out
of
that
mist
i
dare
not
attempt
to
describe
our
first
slide
into
the
abyss
itself
from
the
belt
of
foam
above
had
carried
us
to
a
great
distance
down
the
slope
but
our
farther
descent
was
by
no
means
proportionate
round
and
round
we
swept
not
with
any
uniform
movement
but
in
dizzying
swings
and
jerks
that
sent
us
sometimes
only
a
few
hundred
yards
sometimes
nearly
the
complete
circuit
of
the
whirl
our
progress
downward
at
each
revolution
was
slow
but
very
perceptible
looking
about
me
upon
the
wide
waste
of
liquid
ebony
on
which
we
were
thus
borne
i
perceived
that
our
boat
was
not
the
only
object
in
the
embrace
of
the
whirl
both
above
and
below
us
were
visible
fragments
of
vessels
large
masses
of
building
timber
and
trunks
of
trees
with
many
smaller
articles
such
as
pieces
of
house
furniture
broken
boxes
barrels
and
staves
i
have
already
described
the
unnatural
curiosity
which
had
taken
the
place
of
my
original
terrors
it
appeared
to
grow
upon
me
as
i
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
my
dreadful
doom
i
now
began
to
watch
with
a
strange
interest
the
numerous
things
that
floated
in
our
company
i
have
been
delirious
for
i
even
sought
in
speculating
upon
the
relative
velocities
of
their
several
descents
toward
the
foam
below
fir
tree
i
found
myself
at
one
time
saying
certainly
be
the
next
thing
that
takes
the
awful
plunge
and
disappears
and
then
i
was
disappointed
to
find
that
the
wreck
of
a
dutch
merchant
ship
overtook
it
and
went
down
before
at
length
after
making
several
guesses
of
this
nature
and
being
deceived
in
all
this
fact
the
fact
of
my
invariable
miscalculation
set
me
upon
a
train
of
reflection
that
made
my
limbs
again
tremble
and
my
heart
beat
heavily
once
more
it
was
not
a
new
terror
that
thus
affected
me
but
the
dawn
of
a
more
exciting
this
hope
arose
partly
from
memory
and
partly
from
present
observation
i
called
to
mind
the
great
variety
of
buoyant
matter
that
strewed
the
coast
of
lofoden
having
been
absorbed
and
then
thrown
forth
by
the
by
far
the
greater
number
of
the
articles
were
shattered
in
the
most
extraordinary
way
so
chafed
and
roughened
as
to
have
the
appearance
of
being
stuck
full
of
splinters
but
then
i
distinctly
recollected
that
there
were
of
them
which
were
not
disfigured
at
all
now
i
could
not
account
for
this
difference
except
by
supposing
that
the
roughened
fragments
were
the
only
ones
which
had
been
that
the
others
had
entered
the
whirl
at
so
late
a
period
of
the
tide
or
from
some
reason
had
descended
so
slowly
after
entering
that
they
did
not
reach
the
bottom
before
the
turn
of
the
flood
came
or
of
the
ebb
as
the
case
might
be
i
conceived
it
possible
in
either
instance
that
they
might
thus
be
whirled
up
again
to
the
level
of
the
ocean
without
undergoing
the
fate
of
those
which
had
been
drawn
in
more
early
or
absorbed
more
rapidly
i
made
also
three
important
observations
the
first
was
that
as
a
general
rule
the
larger
the
bodies
were
the
more
rapid
their
descent
the
second
that
between
two
masses
of
equal
extent
the
one
spherical
and
the
other
any
other
shape
the
superiority
in
speed
of
descent
was
with
the
sphere
the
third
that
between
two
masses
of
equal
size
the
one
cylindrical
and
the
other
of
any
other
shape
the
cylinder
was
absorbed
the
more
slowly
since
my
escape
i
have
had
several
conversations
on
this
subject
with
an
old
schoolmaster
of
the
district
and
it
was
from
him
that
i
learned
the
use
of
the
words
and
he
explained
to
me
although
i
have
forgotten
the
explanation
how
what
i
observed
was
in
fact
the
natural
consequence
of
the
forms
of
the
floating
fragments
and
showed
me
how
it
happened
that
a
cylinder
swimming
in
a
vortex
offered
more
resistance
to
its
suction
and
was
drawn
in
with
greater
difficulty
than
an
equally
bulky
body
of
any
form
whatever
footnote
see
archimedes
iis
ques
in
humido
lib
ii
there
was
one
startling
circumstance
which
went
a
great
way
in
enforcing
these
observations
and
rendering
me
anxious
to
turn
them
to
account
and
this
was
that
at
every
revolution
we
passed
something
like
a
barrel
or
else
the
yard
or
the
mast
of
a
vessel
while
many
of
these
things
which
had
been
on
our
level
when
i
first
opened
my
eyes
upon
the
wonders
of
the
whirlpool
were
now
high
up
above
us
and
seemed
to
have
moved
but
little
from
their
original
station
i
no
longer
hesitated
what
to
do
i
resolved
to
lash
myself
securely
to
the
water
cask
upon
which
i
now
held
to
cut
it
loose
from
the
counter
and
to
throw
myself
with
it
into
the
water
i
attracted
my
brother
attention
by
signs
pointed
to
the
floating
barrels
that
came
near
us
and
did
everything
in
my
power
to
make
him
understand
what
i
was
about
to
do
i
thought
at
length
that
he
comprehended
my
design
but
whether
this
was
the
case
or
not
he
shook
his
head
despairingly
and
refused
to
move
from
his
station
by
the
it
was
impossible
to
reach
him
the
emergency
admitted
of
no
delay
and
so
with
a
bitter
struggle
i
resigned
him
to
his
fate
fastened
myself
to
the
cask
by
means
of
the
lashings
which
secured
it
to
the
counter
and
precipitated
myself
with
it
into
the
sea
without
another
moment
hesitation
the
result
was
precisely
what
i
had
hoped
it
might
be
as
it
is
myself
who
now
tell
you
this
tale
as
you
see
that
i
escape
and
as
you
are
already
in
possession
of
the
mode
in
which
this
escape
was
effected
and
must
therefore
anticipate
all
that
i
have
farther
to
say
i
will
bring
my
story
quickly
to
conclusion
it
might
have
been
an
hour
or
thereabout
after
my
quitting
the
smack
when
having
descended
to
a
vast
distance
beneath
me
it
made
three
or
four
wild
gyrations
in
rapid
succession
and
bearing
my
loved
brother
with
it
plunged
headlong
at
once
and
forever
into
the
chaos
of
foam
below
the
barrel
to
which
i
was
attached
sunk
very
little
farther
than
half
the
distance
between
the
bottom
of
the
gulf
and
the
spot
at
which
i
leaped
overboard
before
a
great
change
took
place
in
the
character
of
the
whirlpool
the
slope
of
the
sides
of
the
vast
funnel
became
momently
less
and
less
steep
the
gyrations
of
the
whirl
grew
gradually
less
and
less
violent
by
degrees
the
froth
and
the
rainbow
disappeared
and
the
bottom
of
the
gulf
seemed
slowly
to
uprise
the
sky
was
clear
the
winds
had
gone
down
and
the
full
moon
was
setting
radiantly
in
the
west
when
i
found
myself
on
the
surface
of
the
ocean
in
full
view
of
the
shores
of
lofoden
and
above
the
spot
where
the
pool
of
the
it
was
the
hour
of
the
slack
but
the
sea
still
heaved
in
mountainous
waves
from
the
effects
of
the
hurricane
i
was
borne
violently
into
the
channel
of
the
ström
and
in
a
few
minutes
was
hurried
down
the
coast
into
the
of
the
fishermen
a
boat
picked
me
up
exhausted
from
fatigue
and
now
that
the
danger
was
removed
speechless
from
the
memory
of
its
horror
those
who
drew
me
on
board
were
my
old
mates
and
daily
companions
but
they
knew
me
no
more
than
they
would
have
known
a
traveller
from
the
my
hair
which
had
been
the
day
before
was
as
white
as
you
see
it
now
they
say
too
that
the
whole
expression
of
my
countenance
had
changed
i
told
them
my
story
they
did
not
believe
it
i
now
tell
it
to
you
and
i
can
scarcely
expect
you
to
put
more
faith
in
it
than
did
the
merry
fishermen
of
lofoden
the
masque
of
the
red
death
northern
italy
the
red
death
had
long
devastated
the
country
no
pestilence
had
ever
been
so
fatal
or
so
hideous
blood
was
its
avatar
and
its
seal
the
redness
and
the
horror
of
blood
there
were
sharp
pains
and
sudden
dizziness
and
then
profuse
bleeding
at
the
pores
with
dissolution
the
scarlet
stains
upon
the
body
and
especially
upon
the
face
of
the
victim
were
the
pest
ban
which
shut
him
out
from
the
aid
and
from
the
sympathy
of
his
and
the
whole
seizure
progress
and
termination
of
the
disease
were
the
incidents
of
half
an
hour
but
the
prince
prospero
was
happy
and
dauntless
and
sagacious
when
his
dominions
were
half
depopulated
he
summoned
to
his
presence
a
thousand
hale
and
friends
from
among
the
knights
and
dames
of
his
court
and
with
these
retired
to
the
deep
seclusion
of
one
of
his
castellated
abbeys
this
was
an
extensive
and
magnificent
structure
the
creation
of
the
prince
own
eccentric
yet
august
taste
a
strong
and
lofty
wall
girdled
it
in
this
wall
had
gates
of
iron
the
courtiers
having
entered
brought
furnaces
and
massy
hammers
and
welded
the
bolts
they
resolved
to
leave
means
neither
of
ingress
or
egress
to
the
sudden
impulses
of
despair
or
of
frenzy
from
within
the
abbey
was
amply
provisioned
with
such
precautions
the
courtiers
might
bid
defiance
to
contagion
the
external
world
could
take
care
of
itself
in
the
meantime
it
was
folly
to
grieve
or
to
think
the
prince
had
provided
all
the
appliances
of
pleasure
there
were
buffoons
there
were
improvisatori
there
were
there
were
musicians
there
was
beauty
there
was
wine
all
these
and
security
were
within
without
was
the
red
death
it
was
toward
the
close
of
the
fifth
or
sixth
month
of
his
seclusion
and
while
the
pestilence
raged
most
furiously
abroad
that
the
prince
prospero
entertained
his
thousand
friends
at
a
masked
ball
of
the
most
unusual
magnificence
it
was
a
voluptuous
scene
that
masquerade
but
first
let
me
tell
of
the
rooms
in
which
it
was
held
there
were
seven
an
imperial
suite
in
many
palaces
however
such
suites
form
a
long
and
straight
vista
while
the
slide
back
nearly
to
the
walls
on
either
hand
so
that
the
view
of
the
whole
extent
is
scarcely
impeded
here
the
case
was
very
different
as
might
have
been
expected
from
the
prince
love
of
the
bizarre
the
apartments
were
so
irregularly
disposed
that
the
vision
embraced
but
little
more
than
one
at
a
time
there
was
a
sharp
turn
at
every
twenty
or
thirty
yards
and
at
each
turn
a
novel
effect
to
the
right
and
left
in
the
middle
of
each
wall
a
tall
and
narrow
gothic
window
looked
out
upon
a
closed
corridor
which
pursued
the
windings
of
the
suite
these
windows
were
of
stained
glass
whose
color
varied
in
accordance
with
the
prevailing
hue
of
the
decorations
of
the
chamber
into
which
it
opened
that
at
the
eastern
extremity
was
hung
for
example
in
blue
and
vividly
blue
were
its
windows
the
second
chamber
was
purple
in
its
ornaments
and
tapestries
and
here
the
panes
were
purple
the
third
was
green
throughout
and
so
were
the
casements
the
fourth
was
furnished
and
lighted
with
orange
the
fifth
with
white
the
sixth
with
violet
the
seventh
apartment
was
closely
shrouded
in
black
velvet
tapestries
that
hung
all
over
the
ceiling
and
down
the
walls
falling
in
heavy
folds
upon
a
carpet
of
the
same
material
and
hue
but
in
this
chamber
only
the
color
of
the
windows
failed
to
correspond
with
the
decorations
the
panes
here
were
scarlet
a
deep
now
in
no
one
of
the
seven
apartments
was
there
any
lamp
or
candelabrum
amid
the
profusion
of
golden
ornaments
that
lay
scattered
to
and
fro
or
depended
from
the
roof
there
was
no
light
of
any
kind
emanating
from
lamp
or
candle
within
the
suite
of
chambers
but
in
the
corridors
that
followed
the
suite
there
stood
opposite
to
each
window
a
heavy
tripod
bearing
a
brazier
of
fire
that
projected
its
rays
through
the
tinted
glass
and
so
glaringly
illumined
the
room
and
thus
were
produced
a
multitude
of
gaudy
and
fantastic
appearances
but
in
the
western
or
black
chamber
the
effect
of
the
firelight
that
streamed
upon
the
dark
hangings
through
the
panes
was
ghastly
in
the
extreme
and
produced
so
wild
a
look
upon
the
countenances
of
those
who
entered
that
there
were
few
of
the
company
bold
enough
to
set
foot
within
its
precincts
at
all
it
was
in
this
apartment
also
that
there
stood
against
the
western
wall
a
gigantic
clock
of
ebony
its
pendulum
swung
to
and
fro
with
a
dull
heavy
monotonous
clang
and
when
the
made
the
circuit
of
the
face
and
the
hour
was
to
be
stricken
there
came
from
the
brazen
lungs
of
the
clock
a
sounct
which
was
clear
and
loud
and
deep
and
exceedingly
musical
but
of
so
peculiars
note
and
emphasis
that
at
each
lapse
of
an
hour
the
musicians
of
the
orchestra
were
constrained
to
pause
momentarily
in
their
performance
to
hearken
to
the
sound
and
thus
the
waltzers
perforce
ceased
their
evolutions
and
there
was
a
brief
disconcert
of
the
whole
gay
company
and
while
the
chimes
of
the
clock
yet
rang
it
was
observed
that
the
giddiest
grew
pale
and
the
more
aged
and
sedate
passed
their
hands
over
their
brows
as
if
in
confused
revery
or
meditation
but
when
the
echoes
had
fully
ceased
a
light
laughter
at
once
pervaded
the
assembly
the
musicians
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
as
if
at
their
own
nervousness
and
folly
and
made
whispering
vows
each
to
the
other
that
the
next
chiming
of
the
clock
should
produce
in
them
no
similar
emotion
and
then
after
the
lapse
of
sixty
minutes
which
embrace
three
thousand
and
six
hundred
seconds
of
the
time
that
flies
there
came
yet
another
chiming
of
the
clock
and
then
were
the
same
disconcert
and
tremulousness
and
meditation
as
before
but
in
spite
of
these
things
it
was
a
gay
and
magnificent
revel
the
tastes
of
the
prince
were
peculiar
he
had
a
fine
eye
for
colors
and
effects
he
disregarded
the
of
mere
fashion
his
plans
were
bold
and
fiery
and
his
conceptions
glowed
with
barbaric
lustre
there
are
some
who
would
have
thought
him
mad
his
followers
felt
that
he
was
not
it
was
necessary
to
hear
and
see
and
touch
him
to
be
that
he
was
not
he
had
directed
in
great
part
the
movable
embellishments
of
the
seven
chambers
upon
occasion
of
this
great
and
it
was
his
own
guiding
taste
which
had
given
character
to
the
masqueraders
be
sure
they
were
grotesque
there
were
much
glare
and
glitter
and
piquancy
and
phantasm
much
of
what
has
been
since
seen
in
there
were
arabesque
figures
with
unsuited
limbs
and
appointments
there
were
delirious
fancies
such
as
the
madman
fashions
there
was
much
of
the
beautiful
much
of
the
wanton
much
of
the
bizarre
something
of
the
terrible
and
not
a
little
of
that
which
might
have
excited
disgust
to
and
fro
in
the
seven
chambers
there
stalked
in
fact
a
multitude
of
dreams
and
these
the
dreams
writhed
in
and
about
taking
hue
from
the
rooms
and
causing
the
wild
music
of
the
orchestra
to
seem
as
the
echo
of
their
steps
and
anon
there
strikes
the
ebony
clock
which
stands
in
the
hall
of
the
velvet
and
then
for
a
moment
all
is
still
and
all
is
silent
save
the
voice
of
the
clock
the
dreams
are
as
they
stand
but
the
echoes
of
the
chime
die
away
they
have
endured
but
an
instant
and
a
light
laughter
floats
after
them
as
they
depart
and
now
again
the
music
swells
and
the
dreams
live
and
writhe
to
and
fro
more
merrily
than
ever
taking
hue
from
the
many
tinted
windows
through
which
stream
the
rays
from
the
tripods
but
to
the
chamber
which
lies
most
westwardly
of
the
seven
there
are
now
none
of
the
maskers
who
venture
for
the
night
is
waning
away
and
there
flows
a
ruddier
light
through
the
panes
and
the
blackness
of
the
sable
drapery
appalls
and
to
him
whose
foot
falls
upon
the
sable
carpet
there
comes
from
the
near
clock
of
ebony
a
muffled
peal
more
solemnly
emphatic
than
any
which
reaches
ears
who
indulge
in
the
more
remote
gayeties
of
the
other
apartments
but
these
other
apartments
were
densely
crowded
and
in
them
beat
feverishly
the
heart
of
life
and
the
revel
went
whirlingly
on
until
at
length
there
commenced
the
sounding
of
midnight
upon
the
clock
and
then
the
music
ceased
as
i
have
told
and
the
evolutions
of
the
waltzers
were
quieted
and
there
was
an
uneasy
cessation
of
all
things
as
before
but
now
there
were
twelve
strokes
to
be
sounded
by
the
bell
of
the
clock
and
thus
it
happened
perhaps
that
more
of
thought
crept
with
more
of
time
into
the
meditations
of
the
thoughtful
among
those
who
revelled
and
thus
too
it
happened
perhaps
that
before
the
last
echoes
of
the
last
chime
had
utterly
sunk
into
silence
there
were
many
individuals
in
the
crowd
who
had
found
leisure
to
become
aware
of
the
presence
of
a
masked
figure
which
had
arrested
the
attention
of
no
single
individual
before
and
the
rumor
of
this
new
presence
having
spread
itself
whisperingly
around
there
arose
at
length
from
the
whole
company
a
buzz
or
murmur
expressive
of
disapprobation
and
surprise
then
finally
of
terror
of
horror
and
of
disgust
in
an
assembly
of
phantasms
such
as
i
have
painted
it
may
well
be
supposed
that
no
ordinary
appearance
could
have
excited
such
sensation
in
truth
the
masquerade
license
of
the
night
was
nearly
unlimited
but
the
figure
in
question
had
herod
and
gone
beyond
the
bounds
of
even
the
prince
indefinite
decorum
there
are
chords
in
the
hearts
of
the
most
reckless
which
can
not
be
touched
without
emotion
even
with
the
utterly
lost
to
whom
life
and
death
are
equally
jests
there
are
matters
of
which
no
jest
can
be
made
the
whole
company
indeed
seemed
now
deeply
to
feel
that
in
the
costume
and
bearing
of
the
stranger
neither
wit
nor
propriety
existed
the
figure
was
tall
and
gaunt
and
shrouded
from
head
to
foot
in
the
habiliments
of
the
grave
the
mask
which
concealed
the
visage
was
made
so
nearly
to
resemble
the
countenance
of
a
stiffened
corpse
that
the
closest
scrutiny
must
have
had
difficulty
in
detecting
the
cheat
and
yet
all
this
might
have
been
endured
if
not
approved
by
the
mad
revellers
around
but
the
mummer
had
gone
so
far
as
to
assume
the
type
of
the
red
death
his
vesture
was
dabbled
in
and
his
broad
brow
with
all
the
features
of
the
face
was
besprinkled
with
the
scarlet
horror
when
the
eyes
of
prince
prospero
fell
upon
this
spectral
image
which
with
a
slow
and
solemn
movement
as
if
more
fully
to
sustain
its
stalked
to
and
fro
among
the
waltzers
he
was
seen
to
be
convulsed
in
the
first
moment
with
a
strong
shudder
either
of
terror
or
distaste
but
in
the
next
his
brow
reddened
with
rage
who
dares
he
demanded
hoarsely
of
the
courtiers
who
stood
near
him
who
dares
insult
us
with
this
blasphemous
mockery
seize
him
and
unmask
him
that
we
may
know
whom
we
have
to
hang
at
sunrise
from
the
battlements
it
was
in
the
eastern
or
blue
chamber
in
which
stood
the
prince
prospero
as
he
uttered
these
words
they
rang
throughout
the
seven
rooms
loudly
and
clearly
for
the
prince
was
a
bold
and
robust
man
and
the
music
had
become
hushed
at
the
waving
of
his
hand
it
was
in
the
blue
room
where
stood
the
prince
with
a
group
of
pale
courtiers
by
his
side
at
first
as
he
spoke
there
was
a
slight
rushing
movement
of
this
group
in
the
direction
of
the
intruder
who
at
the
moment
was
also
near
at
hand
and
now
with
deliberate
and
stately
step
made
closer
approach
to
the
speaker
but
from
a
certain
nameless
awe
with
which
the
mad
assumptions
of
the
mummer
had
inspired
the
whole
party
there
were
found
none
who
put
forth
hand
to
seize
him
so
that
unimpeded
he
passed
within
a
yard
of
the
person
and
while
the
vast
assembly
as
if
with
one
impulse
shrank
from
the
centres
of
the
rooms
to
the
walls
he
made
his
way
uninterruptedly
but
with
the
same
solemn
and
measured
step
which
had
distinguished
him
from
the
first
through
the
blue
chamber
to
the
purple
through
the
purple
to
the
green
through
the
green
to
the
orange
through
this
again
to
the
white
and
even
thence
to
the
violet
ere
a
decided
movement
had
been
made
to
arrest
him
it
was
then
however
that
the
prince
prospero
maddening
with
rage
and
the
shame
of
his
own
momentary
cowardice
rushed
hurriedly
through
the
six
chambers
while
none
followed
him
on
account
of
a
deadly
terror
that
had
seized
upon
all
he
bore
aloft
a
drawn
dagger
and
had
approached
in
rapid
impetuosity
to
within
three
or
four
feet
of
the
retreating
figure
when
the
latter
having
attained
the
extremity
of
the
velvet
apartment
turned
suddenly
and
confronted
his
pursuer
there
was
a
sharp
cry
and
the
dagger
dropped
gleaming
upon
the
sable
carpet
upon
which
instantly
afterwards
fell
prostrate
in
death
the
prince
prospero
then
summoning
the
wild
courage
of
despair
a
throng
of
the
revellers
at
once
threw
themselves
into
the
black
apartment
and
seizing
the
mummer
whose
tall
figure
stood
erect
and
motionless
within
the
shadow
of
the
ebony
clock
gasped
in
unutterable
horror
at
finding
the
grave
cerements
and
mask
which
they
handled
with
so
violent
a
rudeness
untenanted
by
any
tangible
form
and
now
was
acknowledged
the
presence
of
the
red
death
he
had
come
like
a
thief
in
the
night
and
one
by
one
dropped
the
revellers
in
the
halls
of
their
revel
and
died
each
in
the
despairing
posture
of
his
fall
and
the
life
of
the
ebony
clock
went
out
with
that
of
the
last
of
the
gay
and
the
flames
of
the
tripods
expired
and
darkness
and
decay
and
the
red
death
held
illimitable
dominion
over
all
the
gold
bug
what
ho
what
ho
this
fellow
is
dancing
mad
he
hath
been
bitten
by
the
tarantula
in
the
many
years
ago
i
contracted
an
intimacy
with
a
william
legrand
he
was
of
an
ancient
huguenot
family
and
had
once
been
wealthy
but
a
series
of
misfortunes
had
reduced
him
to
want
to
avoid
the
mortification
consequent
upon
his
disasters
he
left
new
orleans
the
city
of
his
and
took
up
his
residence
at
island
near
charleston
south
carolina
this
island
is
a
very
singular
one
it
consists
of
little
else
than
the
sea
sand
and
is
about
three
miles
long
its
breadth
at
no
point
exceeds
a
quarter
of
a
mile
it
is
separated
from
the
mainland
by
a
scarcely
perceptible
creek
oozing
its
way
through
a
wilderness
of
reeds
and
slime
a
favorite
resort
of
the
the
vegetation
as
might
be
supposed
is
scant
or
at
least
dwarfish
no
trees
of
any
magnitude
are
to
be
seen
near
the
western
extremity
where
fort
moultrie
stands
and
where
are
some
miserable
frame
buildings
tenanted
during
summer
by
the
fugitives
from
charleston
dust
and
fever
may
be
found
indeed
the
bristly
palmetto
but
the
whole
island
with
the
exception
of
this
western
point
and
a
line
of
hard
white
beach
on
the
seacoast
is
covered
with
a
dense
undergrowth
of
the
sweet
myrtle
so
much
prized
by
the
horticulturists
of
england
the
shrub
here
often
attains
the
height
of
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
and
forms
an
almost
impenetrable
coppice
burdening
the
air
with
its
fragrance
in
the
utmost
recesses
of
this
coppice
not
far
from
the
eastern
or
more
remote
end
of
the
island
legrand
had
built
himself
a
small
hut
which
he
occupied
when
i
first
by
mere
accident
made
his
acquaintance
this
soon
ripened
into
friendship
for
there
was
much
in
the
recluse
to
excite
interest
and
esteem
i
found
him
well
educated
with
unusual
powers
of
mind
but
infected
with
misanthropy
and
subject
to
perverse
moods
of
alternate
enthusiasm
and
melancholy
he
had
with
him
many
books
but
rarely
employed
them
his
chief
amusements
were
gunning
and
fishing
or
sauntering
along
the
beach
and
through
the
myrtles
in
quest
of
shells
or
entomological
specimens
his
collection
of
the
latter
might
have
been
envied
by
a
swammerdamm
in
these
excursions
he
was
usually
accompanied
by
an
old
negro
called
jupiter
who
had
been
manumitted
before
the
reverses
of
the
family
but
who
could
be
induced
neither
by
threats
nor
by
promises
to
abandon
what
he
considered
his
right
of
attendance
upon
the
footsteps
of
his
young
massa
will
it
is
not
improbable
that
the
relatives
of
legrand
conceiving
him
to
be
somewhat
unsettled
in
intellect
had
contrived
to
instil
this
obstinacy
into
jupiter
with
a
view
to
the
supervision
and
guardianship
of
the
wanderer
the
winters
in
the
latitude
of
sullivan
island
are
seldom
very
severe
and
in
the
fall
of
the
year
it
is
a
rare
event
indeed
when
a
fire
is
considered
necessary
about
the
middle
of
october
there
occurred
however
a
day
of
remarkable
chilliness
just
before
sunset
i
scrambled
my
way
through
the
evergreens
to
the
hut
of
my
friend
whom
i
had
not
visited
for
several
weeks
my
residence
being
at
that
time
in
charleston
a
distance
of
nine
miles
from
the
island
while
the
facilities
of
passage
and
were
very
far
behind
those
of
the
present
day
upon
reaching
the
hut
i
rapped
as
was
my
custom
and
getting
no
reply
sought
for
the
key
where
i
knew
it
was
secreted
unlocked
the
door
and
went
in
a
fine
fire
was
blazing
upon
the
hearth
it
was
a
novelty
and
by
no
means
an
ungrateful
one
i
threw
off
an
overcoat
took
an
armchair
by
the
crackling
logs
and
awaited
patiently
the
arrival
of
my
hosts
soon
after
dark
they
arrived
and
gave
me
a
most
cordial
welcome
jupiter
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
bustled
about
to
prepare
some
for
supper
legrand
was
in
one
of
his
fits
how
else
shall
i
term
them
of
enthusiasm
he
had
found
an
unknown
bivalve
forming
a
new
genus
and
more
than
this
he
had
hunted
down
and
secured
with
jupiter
assistance
a
which
he
believed
to
be
totally
new
but
in
respect
to
which
he
wished
to
have
my
opinion
on
the
morrow
and
why
not
i
asked
rubbing
my
hands
over
the
blaze
and
wishing
the
whole
tribe
of
at
the
devil
ah
if
i
had
only
known
you
were
here
said
legrand
but
it
so
long
since
i
saw
you
and
how
could
i
foresee
that
you
would
pay
me
a
visit
this
very
night
of
all
others
as
i
was
coming
home
i
met
lieutenant
g
from
the
fort
and
very
foolishly
i
lent
him
the
bug
so
it
will
be
impossible
for
you
to
see
it
until
the
morning
stay
here
and
i
will
send
jup
down
for
it
at
sunrise
it
is
the
loveliest
thing
in
creation
what
sunrise
nonsense
no
the
bug
it
is
of
a
brilliant
gold
color
about
the
size
of
a
large
with
two
jet
black
spots
near
one
extremity
of
the
back
and
another
somewhat
longer
at
the
other
the
are
dey
aint
tin
in
him
massa
will
i
keep
a
tellin
on
you
here
interrupted
jupiter
de
bug
is
a
solid
ebery
bit
of
him
inside
and
all
sep
him
wing
half
so
hebby
a
bug
in
my
life
well
suppose
it
is
jup
replied
legrand
somewhat
more
earnestly
it
seemed
to
me
than
the
case
demanded
is
that
any
reason
for
your
letting
the
birds
burn
the
color
here
he
turned
to
me
is
really
almost
enough
to
warrant
jupiter
idea
you
never
saw
a
more
brilliant
metallic
lustre
than
the
scales
emit
but
of
this
you
can
not
judge
till
in
the
meantime
i
can
give
you
some
idea
of
the
shape
saying
this
he
seated
himself
at
a
small
table
on
which
were
a
pen
and
ink
but
no
paper
he
looked
for
some
in
a
drawer
but
found
none
never
mind
said
he
at
length
this
will
answer
and
he
drew
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
a
scrap
of
what
i
took
to
be
very
dirty
foolscap
and
made
upon
it
a
rough
drawing
with
the
pen
while
he
did
this
i
retained
my
seat
by
the
fire
for
i
was
still
chilly
when
the
design
was
complete
he
handed
it
to
me
without
rising
as
i
received
it
a
low
growl
was
heard
succeeded
by
a
scratching
at
the
door
jupiter
opened
it
and
a
large
newfoundland
belonging
to
legrand
rushed
in
leaped
upon
my
shoulders
and
loaded
me
with
caresses
for
i
had
shown
him
much
attention
during
previous
visits
when
his
gambols
were
over
i
looked
at
the
paper
and
to
speak
the
truth
found
myself
not
a
little
puzzled
at
what
my
friend
had
depicted
well
i
said
after
contemplating
it
for
some
minutes
this
a
strange
i
must
confess
new
to
me
never
saw
anything
like
it
before
unless
it
was
a
skull
or
a
which
it
more
nearly
resembles
than
anything
else
that
has
come
under
observation
a
echoed
legrand
oh
yes
well
it
has
something
of
that
appearance
upon
paper
no
doubt
the
two
upper
black
spots
look
like
eyes
eh
and
the
longer
one
at
the
bottom
like
a
mouth
and
then
the
shape
of
the
whole
is
oval
perhaps
so
said
i
but
legrand
i
fear
you
are
no
artist
i
must
wait
until
i
see
the
beetle
itself
if
i
am
to
form
any
idea
of
its
personal
appearance
we
i
do
know
said
he
a
little
nettled
i
draw
tolerably
do
it
at
least
have
had
good
masters
and
flatter
myself
that
i
am
not
quite
a
blockhead
but
my
dear
fellow
you
are
joking
then
said
i
this
is
a
very
passable
indeed
i
may
say
that
it
is
a
very
skull
according
to
the
vulgar
notions
about
such
specimens
of
physiology
and
your
must
be
the
queerest
in
the
world
if
it
resembles
it
why
we
may
get
up
a
very
thrilling
bit
of
superstition
upon
this
hint
i
presume
you
will
call
the
bug
caput
or
something
of
that
kind
there
are
many
similar
titles
in
the
natural
histories
but
where
are
the
you
spoke
of
the
said
legrand
who
seemed
to
be
getting
unaccountably
warm
upon
the
subject
i
am
sure
you
must
see
the
i
made
them
as
distinct
as
they
are
in
the
original
insect
and
i
presume
that
is
sufficient
well
well
i
said
perhaps
you
have
still
i
do
see
them
and
i
handed
him
the
paper
without
additional
remark
not
wishing
to
ruffle
his
temper
but
i
was
much
surprised
at
the
turn
affairs
had
taken
his
ill
humor
puzzled
me
and
as
for
the
drawing
of
the
beetle
there
were
positively
visible
and
the
whole
bear
a
very
close
resemblance
to
the
ordinary
cuts
of
a
he
received
the
paper
very
peevishly
and
was
about
to
crumple
it
apparently
to
throw
it
in
the
fire
when
a
casual
glance
at
the
design
seemed
suddenly
to
rivet
his
attention
in
an
instant
his
face
grew
violently
red
in
another
as
excessively
pale
for
some
minutes
he
continued
to
scrutinize
the
drawing
minutely
where
he
sat
at
length
he
arose
took
a
candle
from
the
table
and
proceeded
to
seat
himself
upon
a
in
the
farthest
corner
of
the
room
here
again
he
made
an
anxious
examination
of
the
paper
turning
it
in
all
directions
he
said
nothing
however
and
his
conduct
greatly
astonished
me
yet
i
thought
it
prudent
not
to
exacerbate
the
growing
moodiness
of
his
temper
by
any
comment
presently
he
took
from
his
coat
pocket
a
wallet
placed
the
paper
carefully
in
it
and
deposited
both
in
a
which
he
locked
he
now
grew
more
composed
in
his
demeanor
but
his
original
air
of
enthusiasm
had
quite
disappeared
yet
he
seemed
not
so
much
sulky
as
abstracted
as
the
evening
wore
away
he
became
more
and
more
absorbed
in
revery
from
which
no
sallies
of
mine
could
arouse
him
it
had
been
my
intention
to
pass
the
night
at
the
hut
as
i
had
frequently
done
before
but
seeing
my
host
in
this
mood
i
deemed
it
proper
to
take
leave
he
did
not
press
me
to
remain
but
as
i
departed
he
shook
my
hand
with
even
more
than
his
usual
cordiality
it
was
about
a
month
after
this
and
during
the
interval
i
had
seen
nothing
of
legrand
when
i
received
a
visit
at
charleston
from
his
man
jupiter
i
had
never
seen
the
good
old
negro
look
so
dispirited
and
i
feared
that
some
serious
disaster
had
befallen
my
friend
well
jup
said

visit
from
you
what
de
matter
massa
did
you
bring
any
message
from
mr
legrand
no
massa
i
bring
dis
here
pissel
and
here
jupiter
handed
me
a
note
which
ran
thus
my
dear
why
have
i
not
seen
you
for
so
long
a
time
i
hope
you
have
not
been
so
foolish
as
to
take
offence
at
any
little
of
mine
but
no
that
is
improbable
since
i
saw
you
i
have
had
great
cause
for
anxiety
i
have
something
to
tell
you
yet
scarcely
know
how
to
tell
it
or
whether
i
should
tell
it
at
all
i
have
not
been
quite
well
for
some
days
past
and
poor
old
jup
annoys
me
almost
beyond
endurance
by
his
attentions
would
you
believe
it
he
had
prepared
a
huge
stick
the
other
day
with
which
to
chastise
me
for
giving
him
the
slip
and
spending
the
day
among
the
hills
on
the
mainland
i
verily
believe
that
my
ill
looks
alone
saved
me
a
flogging
i
have
made
no
addition
to
my
cabinet
since
we
met
if
you
can
in
any
way
make
it
convenient
come
over
with
jupiter
come
i
wish
to
see
you
upon
business
of
importance
i
assure
you
that
it
is
of
the
importance
ever
yours
william
legrand
there
was
something
in
the
tone
of
this
note
which
gave
me
great
uneasiness
its
whole
style
differed
materially
from
that
of
legrand
what
could
he
be
dreaming
of
what
new
crotchet
possessed
his
excitable
brain
what
business
of
the
highest
importance
could
possibly
have
to
transact
jupiter
account
of
him
boded
no
good
i
dreaded
lest
the
continued
pressure
of
misfortune
had
at
length
fairly
unsettled
the
reason
of
my
friend
without
a
hesitation
therefore
i
prepared
to
accompany
the
negro
upon
reaching
the
wharf
i
noticed
a
scythe
and
three
spades
all
apparently
new
lying
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
in
which
we
were
to
embark
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
jup
i
inquired
him
syfe
massa
and
spade
very
true
but
what
are
they
doing
here
him
de
syfe
and
de
spade
what
massa
will
sis
pon
my
buying
for
him
in
de
town
and
de
debbil
own
lot
of
money
i
had
to
gib
for
em
but
what
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
mysterious
is
your
going
to
do
with
scythes
and
spades
dat
more
dan
know
and
debbil
take
me
if
i
do
blieve
is
more
dan
he
know
too
but
it
all
cum
ob
de
bug
finding
that
no
satisfaction
was
to
be
obtained
of
jupiter
whose
whole
intellect
seemed
to
be
absorbed
by
de
bug
i
now
stepped
into
the
boat
and
made
sail
with
a
fair
and
strong
breeze
we
soon
ran
into
the
little
cove
to
the
northward
of
fort
moultrie
and
a
walk
of
some
two
miles
brought
us
to
the
hut
it
was
about
three
in
the
afternoon
when
we
arrived
legrand
had
been
awaiting
us
in
eager
expectation
he
grasped
my
hand
with
a
nervous
which
alarmed
me
and
strengthened
the
suspicions
already
entertained
his
countenance
was
pale
even
to
ghastliness
and
his
eyes
glared
with
unnatural
lustre
after
some
inquiries
respecting
his
health
i
asked
him
not
knowing
what
better
to
say
if
he
had
yet
obtained
the
from
lieutenant
g
oh
yes
he
replied
coloring
violently
i
got
it
from
him
the
next
morning
nothing
should
tempt
me
to
part
with
that
do
you
know
that
jupiter
is
quite
right
about
it
in
what
way
i
asked
with
a
sad
foreboding
at
heart
in
supposing
it
to
be
a
bug
of
he
said
this
with
an
air
of
profound
seriousness
and
i
felt
inexpressibly
shocked
this
bug
is
to
make
my
fortune
he
continued
with
a
triumphant
smile
to
reinstate
me
in
my
family
possessions
is
it
any
wonder
then
that
i
prize
it
since
fortune
has
thought
fit
to
bestow
it
upon
me
i
have
only
to
use
it
properly
and
i
shall
arrive
at
the
gold
of
which
it
is
the
index
jupiter
bring
me
that
what
de
bug
massa
i
rudder
not
go
fer
trubble
dat
bug
you
mus
git
him
for
your
own
self
hereupon
legrand
arose
with
a
grave
and
stately
air
and
brought
me
the
beetle
from
a
glass
case
in
which
it
was
enclosed
it
was
a
beautiful
and
at
that
time
unknown
to
naturalists
of
course
a
great
prize
in
a
scientific
point
of
view
there
were
two
round
black
spots
near
one
extremity
of
the
back
and
a
long
one
near
the
other
the
scales
were
exceedingly
hard
and
glossy
with
all
the
appearance
of
burnished
gold
the
weight
of
the
insect
was
very
remarkable
and
taking
all
things
into
consideration
i
could
hardly
blame
jupiter
for
his
opinion
respecting
it
but
what
to
make
of
legrand
agreement
with
that
opinion
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
tell
i
sent
for
you
said
he
in
a
grandiloquent
tone
when
i
had
completed
my
examination
of
the
beetle
i
sent
for
you
that
i
might
have
your
counsel
and
assistance
in
furthering
the
views
of
fate
and
of
the
bug
my
dear
legrand
i
cried
interrupting
him
you
are
certainly
unwell
and
had
better
use
some
little
precautions
you
shall
go
to
bed
and
i
will
remain
with
you
a
few
days
until
you
get
over
this
you
are
feverish
and
feel
my
pulse
said
he
i
felt
it
and
to
say
the
truth
found
not
the
slightest
indication
of
fever
but
you
may
be
ill
and
yet
have
no
fever
allow
me
this
once
to
prescribe
for
you
in
the
first
place
go
to
bed
in
the
next
you
are
mistaken
he
interposed
i
am
as
well
as
i
can
expect
to
be
under
the
excitement
which
i
suffer
if
you
really
wish
me
well
you
will
relieve
this
excitement
and
how
is
this
to
be
done
very
easily
jupiter
and
myself
are
going
upon
an
expedition
into
the
hills
upon
the
mainland
and
in
this
expedition
we
shall
need
the
aid
of
some
person
in
whom
we
can
confide
you
are
the
only
one
we
can
trust
whether
we
succeed
or
fail
the
excitement
which
you
now
perceive
in
me
will
be
equally
allayed
i
am
anxious
to
oblige
you
in
any
way
i
replied
but
do
you
mean
to
say
that
this
infernal
beetle
has
any
connection
with
your
expedition
into
the
hills
it
has
then
legrand
i
can
become
a
party
to
no
such
absurd
proceeding
i
am
sorry
very
sorry
for
we
shall
have
to
try
it
by
ourselves
try
it
by
yourselves
the
man
is
surely
mad
but
stay
how
long
do
you
propose
to
be
absent
probably
all
night
we
shall
start
immediately
and
be
back
at
all
events
by
sunrise
and
will
you
promise
me
upon
your
honor
that
when
this
freak
of
yours
is
over
and
the
bug
business
good
god
settled
to
your
satisfaction
you
will
then
return
home
and
follow
my
advice
implicitly
as
that
of
your
physician
yes
i
promise
and
now
let
us
be
off
for
we
have
no
time
to
lose
with
a
heavy
heart
i
accompanied
my
friend
we
started
about
four
legrand
jupiter
the
dog
and
myself
jupiter
had
with
him
the
scythe
and
spades
the
whole
of
which
he
insisted
upon
carrying
more
through
fear
it
seemed
to
me
of
trusting
either
of
the
implements
within
reach
of
his
master
than
from
any
excess
of
industry
or
complaisance
his
demeanor
was
dogged
in
the
extreme
and
dat
d
d
bug
were
the
sole
words
which
escaped
his
lips
during
the
journey
for
my
own
part
i
had
charge
of
a
couple
of
dark
lanterns
while
legrand
contented
himself
with
the
which
he
carried
attached
to
the
end
of
a
bit
of
twirling
it
to
and
fro
with
the
air
of
a
conjurer
as
he
went
when
i
observed
this
last
plain
evidence
of
my
friend
aberation
of
mind
i
could
scarcely
refrain
from
tears
i
thought
it
best
however
to
humor
his
fancy
at
least
for
the
present
or
until
i
could
adopt
some
more
energetic
measures
with
a
chance
of
success
in
the
meantime
i
endeavored
but
all
in
vain
to
sound
him
in
regard
to
the
object
of
the
expedition
having
succeeded
in
inducing
me
to
accompany
him
he
seemed
unwilling
to
hold
conversation
upon
any
topic
of
minor
importance
and
to
all
my
questions
vouchsafed
no
other
reply
than
we
shall
see
we
crossed
the
creek
at
the
head
of
the
island
by
means
of
a
skiff
and
ascending
the
high
grounds
on
the
shore
of
the
mainland
proceeded
in
a
northwesterly
direction
through
a
tract
of
country
excessively
wild
and
desolate
where
no
trace
of
a
human
footstep
was
to
be
seen
legrand
led
the
way
with
decision
pausing
only
for
an
instant
here
and
there
to
consult
what
appeared
to
be
certain
landmarks
of
his
own
contrivance
upon
a
former
occasion
in
this
manner
we
journeyed
for
about
two
hours
and
the
sun
was
just
setting
when
we
entered
a
region
infinitely
more
dreary
than
any
yet
seen
it
was
a
species
of
tableland
near
the
summit
of
an
almost
inaccessible
hill
densely
wooded
from
base
to
pinnacle
and
interspersed
with
huge
crags
that
appeared
to
lie
loosely
upon
the
soil
and
in
many
cases
were
prevented
from
precipitating
themselves
into
the
valleys
below
merely
by
the
support
of
the
trees
against
which
they
reclined
deep
ravines
in
various
directions
gave
an
air
of
still
sterner
solemnity
to
the
scene
the
natural
platform
to
which
we
had
clambered
was
thickly
overgrown
with
brambles
through
which
we
soon
discovered
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
force
our
way
but
for
the
scythe
and
jupiter
by
direction
of
his
master
proceeded
to
clear
for
us
a
path
to
the
foot
of
an
enormously
tall
tulip
tree
which
stood
with
some
eight
or
ten
oaks
upon
the
level
and
far
surpassed
them
all
and
all
other
trees
which
i
had
then
ever
seen
in
the
beauty
of
its
foliage
and
form
in
the
wide
spread
of
its
branches
and
in
the
general
majesty
of
its
appearance
when
we
reached
this
tree
legrand
turned
to
jupiter
and
asked
him
if
he
thought
he
could
climb
it
the
old
man
seemed
a
little
staggered
by
the
question
and
for
some
moments
made
no
reply
at
length
he
approached
the
huge
trunk
walked
slowly
around
it
and
examined
it
with
minute
attention
when
he
had
completed
his
scrutiny
he
merely
said
yes
massa
jup
climb
any
tree
he
ebber
see
in
he
life
then
up
with
you
as
soon
as
possible
for
it
will
soon
be
too
dark
to
see
what
we
are
about
how
far
mus
go
up
massa
inquired
jupiter
get
up
the
main
trunk
first
and
then
i
will
tell
you
which
way
to
go
and
here
stop
take
this
beetle
with
you
de
bug
massa
will
de
cried
the
negro
drawing
back
in
dismay
what
for
mus
tote
de
bug
way
up
de
tree
d
n
if
i
do
if
you
are
afraid
jup
a
great
big
negro
like
you
to
take
hold
of
a
harmless
little
dead
beetle
why
you
can
carry
it
up
by
this
string
but
if
you
do
not
take
it
up
with
you
in
some
way
i
shall
be
under
the
necessity
of
breaking
your
head
with
this
shovel
what
de
matter
now
massa
said
jup
evidently
shamed
into
compliance
always
want
fur
to
raise
fuss
wid
old
nigger
was
only
funnin
anyhow
feered
de
bug
what
i
keer
for
de
bug
here
he
took
cautiously
hold
of
the
extreme
end
of
the
string
and
maintaining
the
insect
as
far
from
his
person
as
circumstances
would
permit
prepared
to
ascend
the
tree
in
youth
the
tulip
tree
or
the
most
magnificent
of
american
foresters
has
a
trunk
peculiarly
smooth
and
often
rises
to
a
great
height
without
lateral
branches
but
in
its
riper
age
the
bark
becomes
gnarled
and
uneven
while
many
short
limbs
make
their
appearance
on
the
stem
thus
the
difficulty
of
ascension
in
the
present
case
lay
more
in
semblance
than
in
reality
embracing
the
huge
cylinder
as
closely
as
possible
with
his
arms
and
knees
seizing
with
his
hands
some
projections
and
resting
his
naked
toes
upon
others
jupiter
after
one
or
two
narrow
escapes
from
falling
at
length
wriggled
himself
into
the
first
great
fork
and
seemed
to
consider
the
whole
business
as
virtually
accomplished
the
of
the
achievement
was
in
fact
now
over
although
the
climber
was
some
sixty
or
seventy
feet
from
the
ground
which
way
mus
go
now
massa
will
he
asked
keep
up
the
largest
branch
the
one
on
this
side
said
legrand
the
negro
obeyed
him
promptly
and
apparently
with
but
little
trouble
ascending
higher
and
higher
until
no
glimpse
of
his
squat
figure
could
be
obtained
through
the
dense
foliage
which
enveloped
it
presently
his
voice
was
heard
in
a
sort
of
halloo
how
much
fudder
is
got
for
go
how
high
up
are
you
asked
legrand
ebber
so
fur
replied
the
negro
can
see
de
sky
fru
de
top
ob
de
tree
never
mind
the
sky
but
attend
to
what
i
say
look
down
the
trunk
and
count
the
limbs
below
you
on
this
side
how
many
limbs
have
you
passed
one
two
tree
four
fibe
i
done
pass
fibe
big
limb
massa
pon
dis
side
then
go
one
limb
higher
in
a
few
minutes
the
voice
was
heard
again
announcing
that
the
seventh
limb
was
attained
now
jup
cried
legrand
evidently
much
excited
i
want
you
to
work
your
way
out
upon
that
limb
as
far
as
you
can
if
you
see
anything
strange
let
me
know
by
this
time
what
little
doubt
i
might
have
entertained
of
my
poor
friend
insanity
was
put
finally
at
rest
i
had
no
alternative
but
to
conclude
him
stricken
with
lunacy
and
i
became
seriously
anxious
about
getting
him
home
while
i
was
pondering
upon
what
was
best
to
be
done
jupiter

was
again
heard

for

in
the
greatest
distress

i

opportunity
to

a
word
why

during
this
colloquy
no
portion
of
jupiter
person
could
be
seen
but
the
beetle
which
he
had
suffered
to
descend
was
now
visible
at
the
end
of
the
string
and
glistened
like
a
globe
of
burnished
gold
in
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
some
of
which
still
faintly
illumined
the
eminence
upon
which
we
stood
the
hung
quite
clear
of
any
branches
and
if
allowed
to
fall
would
have
fallen
at
our
feet
legrand
immediately
took
the
scythe
and
cleared
with
it
a
circular
space
three
or
four
yards
in
diameter
just
beneath
the
insect
and
having
accomplished
this
ordered
jupiter
to
let
go
the
string
and
come
down
from
the
tree
driving
a
peg
with
great
nicety
into
the
ground
at
the
precise
spot
where
the
beetle
fell
my
friend
now
produced
from
his
pocket
a
fastening
one
end
of
this
at
that
point
of
the
trunk
of
the
tree
which
was
nearest
the
peg
he
unrolled
it
till
it
reached
the
peg
and
thence
farther
unrolled
it
in
the
direction
already
established
by
the
two
points
of
the
tree
and
the
peg
for
the
distance
of
fifty
feet
jupiter
clearing
away
the
brambles
with
the
scythe
at
the
spot
thus
attained
a
second
peg
was
driven
and
about
this
as
a
centre
a
rude
circle
about
four
feet
in
diameter
described
taking
now
a
spade
himself
and
giving
one
to
jupiter
and
one
to
me
legrand
begged
us
to
set
about
digging
as
quickly
as
possible
to
speak
the
truth
i
had
no
especial
relish
for
such
amusement
at
any
time
and
at
that
particular
moment
would
most
willingly
have
declined
it
for
the
night
was
coming
on
and
i
felt
much
fatigued
with
the
exercise
already
taken
but
i
saw
no
mode
of
escape
and
was
fearful
of
disturbing
my
poor
friend
equanimity
by
a
refusal
could
i
have
depended
indeed
upon
jupiter
aid
i
would
have
had
no
hesitation
in
attempting
to
get
the
lunatic
home
by
force
but
i
was
too
well
assured
of
the
old
negro
disposition
to
hope
that
he
would
assist
me
under
any
circumstances
in
a
personal
contest
with
his
master
i
made
no
doubt
that
the
latter
had
been
infected
with
some
of
the
innumerable
southern
superstitions
about
money
buried
and
that
his
fantasy
had
received
confirmation
by
the
finding
of
the
or
perhaps
by
jupiter
obstinacy
in
maintaining
it
to
be
a
bug
of
real
gold
a
mind
disposed
to
lunacy
would
readily
be
led
away
by
such
suggestions
especially
if
chiming
in
with
favorite
preconceived
ideas
and
then
i
called
to
mind
the
poor
fellow
speech
about
the
beetle
being
the
index
of
his
fortune
upon
the
whole
i
was
sadly
vexed
and
puzzled
but
at
length
i
concluded
to
make
a
virtue
of
necessity
to
dig
with
a
good
will
and
thus
the
sooner
to
convince
the
visionary
by
ocular
demonstration
of
the
fallacy
of
the
opinions
he
entertained
the
lanterns
having
been
lit
we
all
fell
to
work
with
a
zeal
worthy
a
more
rational
cause
and
as
the
glare
fell
upon
our
persons
and
implements
i
could
not
help
thinking
how
picturesque
a
group
we
composed
and
how
strange
and
suspicious
our
labors
must
have
appeared
to
any
interloper
who
by
chance
might
have
stumbled
upon
our
whereabouts
we
dug
very
steadily
for
two
hours
little
was
said
and
our
chief
embarrassment
lay
in
the
yelpings
of
the
dog
who
took
exceeding
interest
in
our
proceedings
he
at
length
became
so
obstreperous
that
we
grew
fearful
of
his
giving
the
alarm
to
some
stragglers
in
the
vicinity
or
rather
this
was
the
apprehension
of
legrand
for
myself
i
should
have
rejoiced
at
any
interruption
which
might
have
enabled
me
to
get
the
wanderer
home
the
noise
was
at
length
very
effectually
silenced
by
jupiter
who
getting
out
of
the
hole
with
a
dogged
air
of
deliberation
tied
the
brute
mouth
up
with
one
of
his
suspenders
and
then
returned
with
a
grave
chuckle
to
his
task
when
the
time
mentioned
had
expired
we
had
reached
a
depth
of
five
feet
and
yet
no
signs
of
any
treasure
became
manifest
a
general
pause
ensued
and
i
began
to
hope
that
the
farce
was
at
an
end
legrand
however
although
evidently
much
disconcerted
wiped
his
brow
thoughtfully
and
recommenced
we
had
excavated
the
entire
circle
of
four
feet
diameter
and
now
we
slightly
enlarged
the
limit
and
went
to
the
farther
depth
of
two
feet
still
nothing
appeared
the
whom
i
sincerely
pitied
at
length
clambered
from
the
pit
with
the
bitterest
disappointment
imprinted
upon
every
feature
and
proceeded
slowly
and
reluctantly
to
put
on
his
coat
which
he
had
thrown
off
at
the
beginning
of
his
labor
in
the
meantime
i
made
no
remark
jupiter
at
a
signal
from
his
master
began
to
gather
up
his
tools
this
done
and
the
dog
having
been
unmuzzled
we
turned
in
profound
silence
towards
home
we
had
taken
perhaps
a
dozen
steps
in
this
direction
when
with
a
loud
oath
legrand
strode
up
to
jupiter
and
seized
him
by
the
collar
the
astonished
negro
opened
his
eyes
and
mouth
to
the
fullest
extent
let
fall
the
spades
and
fell
upon
his
knees
you
scoundrel
said
legrand
hissing
out
the
syllables
from
between
his
clenched
teeth
you
infernal
black
villain
speak
i
tell
you
answer
me
this
instant
without
prevarication
which
which
is
your
left
eye
oh
my
golly
massa
will
aint
dis
here
my
lef
eye
for
sartain
roared
the
terrified
jupiter
placing
his
hand
upon
his
organ
of
vision
and
holding
it
there
with
a
desperate
pertinacity
as
if
in
immediate
dread
of
his
master
attempt
at
a
gouge
i
thought
so
i
knew
it
hurrah
vociferated
legrand
letting
the
negro
go
and
executing
a
series
of
curvets
and
caracoles
much
to
the
astonishment
of
his
valet
who
arising
from
his
knees
looked
mutely
from
his
master
to
myself
and
then
from
myself
to
his
master
come
we
must
go
back
said
the
latter
the
game
not
up
yet
and
he
again
led
the
way
to
the
tulip
tree
jupiter
said
he
when
we
reached
its
foot
come
here
was
the
skull
nailed
to
the
limb
with
the
face
outward
or
with
the
face
to
the
limb
de
face
was
out
massa
so
dat
de
crows
could
get
at
de
eyes
good
widout
any
trouble
well
then
was
it
this
eye
or
that
through
which
you
dropped
the
beetle
here
legrand
touched
each
of
jupiter
eyes
was
dis
eye
massa
de
lef
eye
jis
as
you
tell
me
and
here
it
was
his
right
eye
that
the
negro
indicated
that
will
do
we
must
try
it
again
here
my
friend
about
whose
madness
i
now
saw
or
fancied
that
i
saw
certain
indications
of
method
removed
the
peg
which
marked
the
spot
where
the
beetle
fell
to
a
spot
about
three
inches
to
the
westward
of
its
former
position
taking
now
the
from
the
nearest
point
of
the
trunk
to
the
peg
as
before
and
continuing
the
extension
in
a
straight
line
to
the
distance
of
fifty
feet
a
spot
was
indicated
removed
by
several
yards
from
the
point
at
which
we
had
been
digging
around
the
new
position
a
circle
somewhat
larger
than
in
the
former
instance
was
now
described
and
we
again
set
to
work
with
the
spades
i
was
dreadfully
weary
but
scarcely
understanding
what
had
occasioned
the
change
in
my
thoughts
i
felt
no
longer
any
great
aversion
from
the
labor
imposed
i
had
become
most
unaccountably
interested
nay
even
excited
perhaps
there
was
something
amid
all
the
extravagant
demeanor
of
legrand
some
air
of
forethought
or
of
deliberation
which
impressed
me
i
dug
eagerly
and
now
and
then
caught
myself
actually
looking
with
something
that
very
much
resembled
expectation
for
the
fancied
treasure
the
vision
of
which
had
demented
my
unfortunate
companion
at
a
period
when
such
vagaries
of
thought
most
fully
possessed
me
and
when
we
had
been
at
work
perhaps
an
hour
and
a
half
we
were
again
interrupted
by
the
violent
howlings
of
the
dog
his
uneasiness
in
the
first
instance
had
been
evidently
but
the
result
of
playfulness
or
caprice
but
he
now
assumed
a
bitter
and
serious
tone
upon
jupiter
again
attempting
to
muzzle
him
he
made
furious
resistance
and
leaping
into
the
hole
tore
up
the
mould
frantically
with
his
claws
in
a
few
seconds
he
had
uncovered
a
mass
of
human
bones
forming
two
complete
skeletons
intermingled
with
several
buttons
of
metal
and
what
appeared
to
be
the
dust
of
decayed
woollen
one
or
two
strokes
of
a
spade
upturned
the
blade
of
a
large
spanish
knife
and
as
he
dug
farther
three
or
four
loose
pieces
of
gold
and
silver
coin
came
to
light
at
sight
of
these
the
joy
of
jupiter
could
scarcely
be
restrained
but
the
countenance
of
his
master
wore
an
air
of
extreme
disappointment
he
urged
us
however
to
continue
our
exertions
and
the
words
were
hardly
uttered
when
i
stumbled
and
fell
forward
having
caught
the
toe
of
my
boot
in
a
large
ring
of
iron
that
lay
half
buried
in
the
loose
earth
we
now
worked
in
earnest
and
never
did
i
pass
ten
minutes
of
more
intense
excitement
during
this
interval
we
had
fairly
unearthed
an
oblong
chest
of
wood
which
from
its
perfect
preservation
and
wonderful
hardness
had
plainly
been
subjected
to
some
mineralizing
process
perhaps
that
of
the
bichloride
of
mercury
this
box
was
three
feet
and
a
half
long
three
feet
broad
and
two
and
a
half
feet
deep
it
was
firmly
secured
by
bands
of
wrought
iron
riveted
and
forming
a
kind
of
over
the
whole
on
each
side
of
the
chest
near
the
top
were
three
rings
of
iron
six
in
all
by
means
of
which
a
firm
hold
could
be
obtained
by
six
persons
our
utmost
united
endeavors
served
only
to
disturb
the
coffer
very
slightly
in
its
bed
we
at
once
saw
the
impossibility
of
removing
so
great
a
weight
luckily
the
sole
fastenings
of
the
lid
consisted
of
two
sliding
bolts
these
we
drew
back
trembling
and
panting
with
anxiety
in
an
instant
a
treasure
of
incalculable
value
lay
gleaming
before
us
as
the
rays
of
the
lanterns
fell
within
the
pit
there
flashed
upwards
from
a
confused
heap
of
gold
and
of
jewels
a
glow
and
a
glare
that
absolutely
dazzled
our
eyes
i
shall
not
pretend
to
describe
the
feelings
with
which
i
gazed
amazement
was
of
course
predominant
legrand
appeared
exhausted
with
excitement
and
spoke
very
few
words
countenance
wore
for
some
minutes
as
deadly
a
pallor
as
it
is
possible
in
the
nature
of
things
for
any
negro
visage
to
assume
he
seemed
stupified
presently
he
fell
upon
his
knees
in
the
pit
and
burying
his
naked
arms
up
to
the
elbows
in
gold
let
them
there
remain
as
if
enjoying
the
luxury
of
a
bath
at
length
with
a
deep
sigh
he
exclaimed
as
if
in
a
soliloquy
and
dis
all
cum
ob
de
de
putty
de
poor
little
what
i
boosed
in
dat
sabage
kind
ob
style
aint
you
shamed
ob
yourself
nigger
answer
me
dat
it
became
necessary
at
last
that
i
should
arouse
both
master
and
valet
to
the
expediency
of
removing
the
treasure
it
was
growing
late
and
it
behooved
us
to
make
exertion
that
we
might
get
everything
housed
before
daylight
it
was
difficult
to
say
what
should
be
done
and
much
time
was
spent
in
deliberation
so
confused
were
the
ideas
of
all
we
finally
lightened
the
box
by
removing
of
its
contents
when
we
were
enabled
with
some
trouble
to
raise
it
from
the
hole
the
articles
taken
out
were
deposited
among
the
brambles
and
the
dog
left
to
guard
them
with
strict
orders
from
jupiter
neither
upon
any
pretence
to
stir
from
the
spot
nor
to
open
his
mouth
until
our
return
we
then
hurriedly
made
for
home
with
the
chest
reaching
the
hut
in
safety
but
after
excessive
toil
at
one
in
the
morning
worn
out
as
we
were
it
was
not
in
human
nature
to
do
more
just
now
we
rested
until
two
and
had
supper
starting
for
the
hills
immediately
afterwards
armed
with
three
stout
sacks
which
by
good
luck
were
upon
the
premises
a
little
before
four
we
arrived
at
the
pit
divided
the
remainder
of
the
booty
as
equally
as
might
be
among
us
and
leaving
the
holes
unfilled
again
set
out
for
the
hut
at
which
for
the
second
time
we
deposited
our
golden
burdens
just
as
the
first
streaks
of
the
dawn
gleamed
from
over
the
in
the
east
we
were
now
thoroughly
broken
down
but
the
intense
excitement
of
the
time
denied
us
repose
after
an
unquiet
slumber
of
some
three
or
four
hours
duration
we
arose
as
if
by
preconcert
to
make
examination
of
our
treasure
the
chest
had
been
full
to
the
brim
and
we
spent
the
whole
day
and
the
greater
part
of
the
next
night
in
a
scrutiny
of
its
contents
there
had
been
nothing
like
order
or
arrangement
everything
had
been
heaped
in
promiscuously
having
assorted
all
with
care
we
found
ourselves
possessed
of
even
vaster
wealth
than
we
had
at
first
supposed
in
coin
there
was
rather
more
than
four
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
estimating
the
value
of
the
pieces
as
accurately
as
we
could
by
the
tables
of
the
period
there
was
not
a
particle
of
silver
all
was
gold
of
antique
date
and
of
great
variety
french
spanish
and
german
money
with
a
few
english
guineas
and
some
counters
of
which
we
had
never
seen
specimens
before
there
were
several
very
large
and
heavy
coins
so
worn
that
we
could
make
nothing
of
their
inscriptions
there
was
no
american
money
the
value
of
the
jewels
we
found
more
difficulty
in
estimating
there
were
diamonds
some
of
them
exceedingly
large
and
fine
a
hundred
and
ten
in
all
and
not
one
of
them
small
eighteen
rubies
of
remarkable
brilliancy
three
hundred
and
ten
emeralds
all
very
beautiful
and
sapphires
with
an
opal
these
stones
had
all
been
broken
from
their
settings
and
thrown
loose
in
the
chest
the
settings
themselves
which
we
picked
out
from
among
the
other
gold
appeared
to
have
been
beaten
up
with
hammers
as
if
to
prevent
identification
besides
all
this
there
was
a
vast
quantity
of
solid
gold
ornaments
nearly
two
hundred
massive
finger
and
rich
chains
thirty
of
these
if
i
remember
very
large
and
heavy
crucifixes
five
gold
censers
of
great
value
a
prodigious
golden
ornamented
with
richly
chased
and
bacchanalian
figures
with
two
exquisitely
embossed
and
many
other
smaller
articles
which
i
can
not
recollect
the
weight
of
these
valuables
exceeded
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
avoirdupois
and
in
this
estimate
i
have
not
included
one
hundred
and
superb
gold
watches
three
of
the
number
being
worth
each
five
hundred
dollars
if
one
many
of
them
were
very
old
and
as
valueless
the
works
having
suffered
more
or
less
from
corrosion
but
all
were
richly
jewelled
and
in
cases
of
great
worth
we
estimated
the
entire
contents
of
the
chest
that
night
at
a
million
and
a
half
of
dollars
and
upon
the
subsequent
disposal
of
the
trinkets
and
jewels
a
few
being
retained
for
our
own
use
it
was
found
that
we
had
greatly
undervalued
the
treasure
when
at
length
we
had
concluded
our
examination
and
the
intense
excitement
of
the
time
had
in
some
measure
subsided
legrand
who
saw
that
i
was
dying
with
impatience
for
a
solution
of
this
most
extraordinary
riddle
entered
into
a
full
detail
of
all
the
circumstances
connected
with
it
you
remember
said
he
the
night
when
i
handed
you
the
rough
sketch
i
had
made
of
the
you
recollect
also
that
i
became
quite
vexed
at
you
for
insisting
that
my
drawing
resembled
a
when
you
first
made
this
assertion
i
thought
you
were
jesting
but
afterwards
i
called
to
mind
the
peculiar
spots
on
the
back
of
the
insect
and
admitted
to
myself
that
your
remark
had
some
little
foundation
in
fact
still
the
sneer
at
my
graphic
powers
irritated
me
for
i
am
considered
a
good
artist
and
therefore
when
you
handed
me
the
scrap
of
parchment
i
was
about
to
crumple
it
up
and
throw
it
angrily
into
the
fire
the
scrap
of
paper
you
mean
said
i
no
it
had
much
of
the
appearance
of
paper
and
at
first
i
supposed
it
to
be
such
but
when
i
came
to
draw
upon
it
i
discovered
it
at
once
to
be
a
piece
of
very
thin
parchment
it
was
quite
dirty
you
remember
well
as
i
was
in
the
very
act
of
crumpling
it
up
my
glance
fell
upon
the
sketch
at
which
you
had
been
looking
and
you
may
imagine
my
astonishment
when
i
perceived
in
fact
the
figure
of
a
just
where
it
seemed
to
me
i
had
made
the
drawing
of
the
beetle
for
a
moment
i
was
too
much
amazed
to
think
with
accuracy
i
knew
that
my
design
was
very
different
in
detail
from
this
although
there
was
a
certain
similarity
in
general
outline
presently
i
took
a
candle
and
seating
myself
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
proceeded
to
scrutinize
the
parchment
more
closely
upon
turning
it
over
i
saw
my
own
sketch
upon
the
reverse
just
as
i
had
made
it
my
first
idea
now
was
mere
surprise
at
the
really
remarkable
similarity
of
outline
at
the
singular
coincidence
involved
in
the
fact
that
unknown
to
me
there
should
have
been
a
skull
upon
the
other
side
of
the
parchment
immediately
beneath
my
figure
of
the
and
that
this
skull
not
only
in
outline
but
in
size
should
so
closely
resemble
my
drawing
i
say
the
singularity
of
this
coincidence
absolutely
stupified
me
for
a
time
this
is
the
usual
effect
of
such
coincidences
the
mind
struggles
to
establish
a
connection
a
sequence
of
cause
and
effect
and
being
unable
to
do
so
suffers
a
species
of
temporary
paralysis
but
when
i
recovered
from
this
stupor
there
dawned
upon
me
gradually
a
conviction
which
startled
me
even
far
more
than
the
coincidence
i
began
distinctly
positively
to
remember
that
there
had
been
drawing
on
the
parchment
when
i
made
my
sketch
of
the
i
became
perfectly
certain
of
this
for
i
recollected
turning
up
first
one
side
and
then
the
other
in
search
of
the
cleanest
spot
had
the
skull
been
then
there
of
course
i
could
not
have
failed
to
notice
it
here
was
indeed
a
mystery
which
i
felt
it
impossible
to
explain
but
even
at
that
early
moment
there
seemed
to
glimmer
faintly
within
the
most
remote
and
secret
chambers
of
my
intellect
a
conception
of
that
truth
which
last
night
adventure
brought
to
so
magnificent
a
demonstration
i
arose
at
once
and
putting
the
parchment
securely
away
dismissed
all
farther
reflection
until
i
should
be
alone
when
you
had
gone
and
when
jupiter
was
fast
asleep
i
betook
myself
to
a
more
methodical
investigation
of
the
affair
in
the
first
place
i
considered
the
manner
in
which
the
parchment
had
come
into
my
possession
the
spot
where
we
discovered
the
was
on
the
coast
of
the
mainland
about
a
mile
eastward
of
the
island
and
but
a
short
distance
above
mark
upon
my
taking
hold
of
it
it
gave
me
a
sharp
bite
which
caused
me
to
let
it
drop
jupiter
with
his
accustomed
caution
before
seizing
the
insect
which
had
flown
towards
him
looked
about
him
for
a
leaf
or
something
of
that
nature
by
which
to
take
hold
of
it
it
was
at
this
moment
that
his
eyes
and
mine
also
fell
upon
the
scrap
of
parchment
which
i
then
supposed
to
be
paper
it
was
lying
in
the
sand
a
corner
sticking
up
near
the
spot
where
we
found
it
i
observed
the
remnants
of
the
hull
of
what
appeared
to
have
been
a
ship
long
boat
the
wreck
seemed
to
have
been
there
for
a
very
great
while
for
the
resemblance
to
boat
timbers
could
scarcely
be
traced
well
jupiter
picked
up
the
parchment
wrapped
the
beetle
in
it
and
gave
it
to
me
soon
afterwards
we
turned
to
go
home
and
on
the
way
met
lieutenant
g
i
showed
him
the
insect
and
he
begged
me
to
let
him
take
it
to
the
fort
on
my
consenting
he
thrust
it
forthwith
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
without
the
parchment
in
which
it
had
been
wrapped
and
which
i
had
continued
to
hold
in
my
hand
during
his
inspection
perhaps
he
dreaded
my
changing
my
mind
and
thought
it
best
to
make
sure
of
the
prize
at
once
you
know
how
enthusiastic
he
is
on
all
subjects
connected
with
natural
history
at
the
same
time
without
being
conscious
of
it
i
must
have
deposited
the
parchment
in
my
own
pocket
you
remember
that
when
i
went
to
the
table
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
sketch
of
the
beetle
i
found
no
paper
where
it
was
usually
kept
i
looked
in
the
drawer
and
found
none
there
i
searched
my
pockets
hoping
to
find
an
old
letter
and
then
my
hand
fell
upon
the
parchment
i
thus
detail
the
precise
mode
in
which
it
came
into
my
possession
for
the
circumstances
impressed
me
with
peculiar
force
no
doubt
you
will
think
me
fanciful
but
i
had
already
established
a
kind
of
i
had
put
together
two
links
of
a
great
chain
there
was
a
boat
lying
on
a
seacoast
and
not
far
from
the
boat
was
a
parchment
a
with
a
skull
depicted
on
it
you
will
of
course
ask
is
the
connection
i
reply
that
the
skull
or
is
the
emblem
of
the
pirate
the
flag
of
the
is
hoisted
in
all
engagements
i
have
said
that
the
scrap
was
parchment
and
not
paper
parchment
is
durable
almost
imperishable
matters
of
little
moment
are
rarely
consigned
to
parchment
since
for
the
mere
ordinary
purposes
of
drawing
or
writing
it
is
not
nearly
so
well
adapted
as
paper
this
reflection
suggested
some
meaning
some
relevancy
in
the
i
did
not
fail
to
observe
also
the
of
the
parchment
although
one
of
its
corners
had
been
by
some
accident
destroyed
it
could
be
seen
that
the
original
form
was
oblong
it
was
just
such
a
slip
indeed
as
might
have
been
chosen
for
a
memorandum
for
a
record
of
something
to
be
long
remembered
and
carefully
preserved
but
i
interposed
you
say
that
the
skull
was
upon
the
parchment
when
you
made
the
drawing
of
the
beetle
how
then
do
you
trace
any
connection
between
the
boat
and
the
skull
since
this
latter
according
to
your
own
admission
must
have
been
designed
god
only
knows
how
or
by
whom
at
some
period
subsequent
to
your
sketching
the
ah
hereupon
turns
the
whole
mystery
although
the
secret
at
this
point
i
had
comparatively
little
difficulty
in
solving
my
steps
were
sure
and
could
afford
but
a
single
result
i
reasoned
for
example
thus
when
i
drew
the
there
was
no
skull
apparent
on
the
parchment
when
i
had
completed
the
drawing
i
gave
it
to
you
and
observed
you
narrowly
until
you
returned
it
therefore
did
not
design
the
skull
and
no
one
else
was
present
to
do
it
then
it
was
not
done
by
human
agency
and
nevertheless
it
was
done
at
this
stage
of
my
reflections
i
endeavored
to
remember
and
remember
with
entire
distinctness
every
incident
which
occurred
about
the
period
in
question
the
weather
was
chilly
o
rare
and
happy
accident
and
a
fire
was
blazing
on
the
hearth
i
was
heated
with
exercise
and
sat
near
the
table
you
however
had
drawn
a
chair
close
to
the
chimney
just
as
i
placed
the
parchment
in
your
hand
and
as
you
were
in
the
act
of
inspecting
it
wolf
the
newfoundland
entered
and
leaped
upon
your
shoulders
with
your
left
hand
you
caressed
him
and
kept
him
off
while
your
right
holding
the
parchment
was
permitted
to
fall
listlessly
between
your
knees
and
in
close
proximity
to
the
fire
at
one
moment
i
thought
the
blaze
had
caught
it
and
was
about
to
caution
you
but
before
i
could
speak
you
had
withdrawn
it
and
were
engaged
in
its
examination
when
i
considered
all
these
particulars
i
doubted
not
for
a
moment
that
had
been
the
agent
in
bringing
to
light
on
the
parchment
the
skull
which
i
saw
designed
on
it
you
are
well
aware
that
chemical
preparations
exist
and
have
existed
time
out
of
mind
by
means
of
which
it
is
possible
to
write
on
either
paper
or
vellum
so
that
the
characters
shall
become
visible
only
when
subjected
to
the
action
of
fire
zaffre
digested
in
and
diluted
with
four
times
its
weight
of
water
is
sometimes
employed
a
green
tint
results
the
regulus
of
cobalt
dissolved
in
spirit
of
nitre
gives
a
red
these
colors
disappear
at
longer
or
shorter
intervals
after
the
material
written
upon
cools
but
again
become
apparent
upon
the
of
heat
i
now
scrutinized
the
with
care
its
outer
edges
the
edges
of
the
drawing
nearest
the
edge
of
the
vellum
were
far
more
than
the
others
it
was
clear
that
the
action
of
the
caloric
had
been
imperfect
or
unequal
i
immediately
kindled
a
fire
and
subjected
every
portion
of
the
parchment
to
a
glowing
heat
at
first
the
only
effect
was
the
strengthening
of
the
faint
lines
in
the
skull
but
on
persevering
in
the
experiment
there
became
visible
at
the
corner
of
the
slip
diagonally
opposite
to
the
spot
in
which
the
was
delineated
the
figure
of
what
i
at
first
supposed
to
be
a
goat
a
closer
scrutiny
however
satisfied
me
that
it
was
intended
for
a
kid
ha
ha
said
i
to
be
sure
i
have
no
right
to
laugh
at
you
a
million
and
a
half
of
money
is
too
serious
a
matter
for
mirth
but
you
are
not
about
to
establish
a
third
link
in
your
chain
you
will
not
find
any
especial
connection
between
your
pirates
and
a
goat
pirates
you
know
have
nothing
to
do
with
goats
they
appertain
to
the
farming
interest
but
i
have
just
said
that
the
figure
was
that
of
a
goat
well
a
kid
then
pretty
much
the
same
thing
pretty
much
but
not
altogether
said
legrand
you
may
have
heard
of
one
kidd
i
at
once
looked
on
the
figure
of
the
animal
as
a
kind
of
punning
or
hieroglyphical
signature
i
say
signature
because
its
position
on
the
vellum
suggested
this
idea
the
at
the
corner
diagonally
opposite
had
in
the
same
manner
the
air
of
a
stamp
or
seal
but
i
was
sorely
put
out
by
the
absence
of
all
else
of
the
body
to
my
imagined
instrument
of
the
text
for
my
context
i
presume
you
expected
to
find
a
letter
between
the
stamp
and
the
signature
something
of
that
kind
the
fact
is
i
felt
irresistibly
impressed
with
a
presentiment
of
some
vast
good
fortune
impending
i
can
scarcely
say
why
perhaps
after
all
it
was
rather
a
desire
than
an
actual
belief
but
do
you
know
that
jupiter
silly
words
about
the
bug
being
of
solid
gold
had
a
remarkable
effect
on
my
fancy
and
then
the
series
of
accidents
and
coincidences
these
were
so
extraordinary
do
you
observe
how
mere
an
accident
it
was
that
these
events
should
have
occurred
on
the
day
of
all
the
year
in
which
it
has
been
or
may
be
sufficiently
cool
for
fire
and
that
without
the
fire
or
without
the
intervention
of
the
dog
at
the
precise
moment
in
which
he
appeared
i
should
never
have
become
aware
of
the
and
so
never
the
possessor
of
the
treasure
but
proceed
i
am
all
impatience
well
you
have
heard
of
course
the
many
stories
current
the
thousand
vague
rumors
afloat
about
money
buried
somewhere
on
the
atlantic
coast
by
kidd
and
his
associates
these
rumors
must
have
had
some
foundation
in
fact
and
that
the
rumors
have
existed
so
long
and
so
continuously
could
have
resulted
it
appeared
to
me
only
from
the
circumstance
of
the
buried
treasure
still
entombed
had
kidd
concealed
his
plunder
for
a
time
and
afterwards
reclaimed
it
the
rumors
would
scarcely
have
reached
us
in
their
present
unvarying
form
you
will
observe
that
the
stories
told
are
all
about
not
about
had
the
pirate
recovered
his
money
there
the
affair
would
have
dropped
it
seemed
to
me
that
some
accident
say
the
loss
of
a
memorandum
indicating
its
locality
had
deprived
him
of
the
means
of
recovering
it
and
that
this
accident
had
become
known
to
his
followers
who
otherwise
might
never
have
heard
that
treasure
had
been
concealed
at
all
and
who
busying
themselves
in
vain
because
unguided
attempts
to
regain
it
had
given
first
birth
and
then
universal
currency
to
the
reports
which
are
now
so
common
have
you
ever
heard
of
any
important
treasure
being
unearthed
along
the
coast
never
but
that
kidd
accumulations
were
immense
is
well
known
i
took
it
for
granted
therefore
that
the
earth
still
held
them
and
you
will
scarcely
be
surprised
when
i
tell
you
that
i
felt
a
hope
nearly
amounting
to
certainty
that
the
parchment
so
strangely
found
involved
a
lost
record
of
the
place
of
deposit
but
how
did
you
proceed
i
held
the
vellum
again
to
the
fire
after
increasing
the
heat
but
nothing
appeared
i
now
thought
it
possible
that
the
coating
of
dirt
might
have
something
to
do
with
the
failure
so
i
carefully
rinsed
the
parchment
by
pouring
warm
water
over
it
and
having
done
this
i
placed
it
in
a
tin
pan
with
the
skull
downwards
and
put
the
pan
upon
a
furnace
of
lighted
charcoal
in
a
few
minutes
the
pan
having
become
thoroughly
heated
i
removed
the
slip
and
to
my
inexpressible
joy
found
it
spotted
in
several
places
with
what
appeared
to
be
figures
arranged
in
lines
again
i
placed
it
in
the
pan
and
suffered
it
to
remain
another
minute
upon
taking
it
off
the
whole
was
just
as
you
see
it
now
here
legrand
having
reheated
the
parchment
submitted
it
to
my
inspection
the
following
characters
were
rudely
traced
in
a
red
tint
between
the
and
the
goat
but
said
i
returning
him
the
slip
i
am
as
much
in
the
dark
as
ever
were
all
the
jewels
of
golconda
awaiting
me
on
my
solution
of
this
enigma
i
am
quite
sure
that
i
should
be
unable
to
earn
them
and
yet
said
legrand
the
solution
is
by
no
means
so
difficult
as
you
might
be
led
to
imagine
from
the
first
hasty
inspection
of
the
characters
these
characters
as
any
one
might
readily
guess
form
a
cipher
that
is
to
say
they
convey
a
meaning
but
then
from
what
is
known
of
kidd
i
could
not
suppose
him
capable
of
constructing
any
of
the
more
abstruse
cryptographs
i
made
up
my
mind
at
once
that
this
was
of
a
simple
species
such
however
as
would
appear
to
the
crude
intellect
of
the
sailor
absolutely
insoluble
without
the
key
and
you
really
solved
it
readily
i
have
solved
others
of
an
abstruseness
ten
thousand
times
greater
circumstances
and
a
certain
bias
of
mind
have
led
me
to
take
interest
in
such
riddles
and
it
may
well
be
doubted
whether
human
ingenuity
can
construct
an
enigma
of
the
kind
which
human
ingenuity
may
not
by
proper
application
resolve
in
fact
having
once
established
connected
and
legible
characters
i
scarcely
gave
a
thought
to
the
mere
difficulty
of
developing
their
import
in
the
present
case
indeed
in
all
cases
of
secret
writing
the
first
question
regards
the
of
the
cipher
for
the
principles
of
solution
so
far
especially
as
the
more
simple
ciphers
are
concerned
depend
on
and
are
varied
by
the
genius
of
the
particular
idiom
in
general
there
is
no
alternative
but
experiment
directed
by
probabilities
of
every
tongue
known
to
him
who
attempts
the
solution
until
the
true
one
be
attained
but
with
the
cipher
now
before
us
all
difficulty
is
removed
by
the
signature
the
pun
upon
the
word
is
appreciable
in
no
other
language
than
the
english
but
for
this
consideration
i
should
have
begun
my
attempts
with
the
spanish
and
french
as
the
tongues
in
which
a
secret
of
this
kind
would
most
naturally
have
been
written
by
a
pirate
of
the
spanish
main
as
it
was
i
assumed
the
cryptograph
to
be
english
you
observe
there
are
no
divisions
between
the
words
had
there
been
divisions
the
task
would
have
been
comparatively
easy
in
such
case
i
should
have
commenced
with
a
collation
and
analysis
of
the
shorter
words
and
had
a
word
of
a
single
letter
occurred
as
is
most
likely
or
for
example
i
should
have
considered
the
solution
as
assured
but
there
being
no
division
my
first
step
was
to
ascertain
the
predominant
letters
as
well
as
the
least
frequent
counting
all
i
constructed
a
table
thus
of
the
character
there
are
now
in
english
the
letter
which
most
frequently
occurs
is
afterwards
the
succession
runs
thus
o

predominates
however
so
remarkably
that
an
individual
sentence
of
any
length
is
rarely
seen
in
which
it
is
not
the
prevailing
character
here
then
we
have
in
the
very
beginning
the
groundwork
for
something
more
than
a
mere
guess
the
general
use
which
may
be
made
of
the
table
is
obvious
but
in
this
particular
cipher
we
shall
only
very
partially
require
its
aid
as
our
predominant
character
is
we
will
commence
by
assuming
it
as
the
of
the
natural
alphabet
to
verify
the
supposition
let
us
observe
if
the
be
seen
often
in
couples
for
is
doubled
with
great
frequency
in
english
in
such
words
for
example
as
etc
in
the
present
instance
we
see
it
doubled
no
less
than
five
times
although
the
cryptograph
is
brief
let
us
assume
then
as
now
of
all
in
the
language
is
most
usual
let
us
see
therefore
whether
there
are
not
repetitions
of
any
three
characters
in
the
same
order
of
collocation
the
last
of
them
being
if
we
discover
repetitions
of
such
letters
so
arranged
they
will
most
probably
represent
the
word
on
inspection
we
find
no
less
than
seven
such
arrangements
the
characters
being
we
may
therefore
assume
that
the
semicolon
represents
that
represents
and
that
represents
the
last
being
now
well
confirmed
thus
a
great
step
has
been
taken
but
having
established
a
single
word
we
are
enabled
to
establish
a
vastly
important
point
that
is
to
say
several
commencements
and
terminations
of
other
words
let
us
refer
for
example
to
the
last
instance
but
one
in
which
combination
occurs
not
far
from
the
end
of
the
cipher
we
know
that
the
semicolon
immediately
ensuing
is
the
commencement
of
a
word
and
of
the
six
characters
succeeding
this
we
are
cognizant
of
no
less
than
five
let
us
set
these
characters
down
thus
by
the
letters
we
know
them
to
represent
leaving
a
space
for
the
unknown
t
eeth
here
we
are
enabled
at
once
to
discard
the
as
forming
no
portion
of
the
word
commencing
with
the
first
since
by
experiment
of
the
entire
alphabet
for
a
letter
adapted
to
the
vacancy
we
perceive
that
no
word
can
be
formed
of
which
this
can
be
a
part
we
are
thus
narrowed
into
t
ee
and
going
through
the
alphabet
if
necessary
as
before
we
arrive
at
the
word
as
the
sole
possible
reading
we
thus
gain
another
letter
represented
by
with
the
words
tree
in
juxtaposition
looking
beyond
these
words
for
a
short
distance
we
again
see
the
combination
and
employ
it
by
way
of
to
what
immediately
precedes
we
have
thus
this
arrangement
the
tree
the
or
substituting
the
natural
letters
where
known
it
reads
thus
the
tree
the
now
if
in
place
of
the
unknown
characters
we
leave
blank
spaces
or
substitute
dots
we
read
thus
the
tree
thr
h
the
when
the
word
makes
itself
evident
at
once
but
this
discovery
gives
us
three
new
letters
and
represented
by
and
looking
now
narrowly
through
the
cipher
for
combinations
of
known
characters
we
find
not
very
far
from
the
beginning
this
arrangement
or
egree
which
plainly
is
the
conclusion
of
the
word
and
gives
us
another
letter
represented
by
four
letters
beyond
the
word
we
perceive
the
combination
translating
the
known
characters
and
representing
the
unknown
by
dots
as
before
we
read
thus
th
rtee
an
arrangement
immediately
suggestive
of
the
word
and
again
furnishing
us
with
two
new
characters
and
represented
by
and
referring
now
to
the
beginning
of
the
cryptograph
we
find
the
combination
translating
as
before
we
obtain
good
which
assures
us
that
the
first
letter
is
and
that
the
first
two
words
are
good
to
avoid
confusion
it
is
now
time
that
we
arrange
our
key
as
far
as
discovered
in
a
tabular
form
it
will
stand
thus
represents
a
d
e
g
h
i
n
o
r
t
we
have
therefore
no
less
than
ten
of
the
most
important
letters
represented
and
it
will
be
unnecessary
to
proceed
with
the
details
of
the
solution
i
have
said
enough
to
convince
you
that
ciphers
of
this
nature
are
readily
soluble
and
to
give
you
some
insight
into
the
rationale
of
their
development
but
be
assured
that
the
specimen
before
us
appertains
to
the
very
simplest
species
of
cryptograph
it
now
only
remains
to
give
you
the
full
translation
of
the
characters
upon
the
parchment
as
unriddled
here
it
is
good
glass
in
the
bishop
hostel
in
the
devil
seat
degrees
and
thirteen
minutes
northeast
and
by
north
main
branch
seventh
limb
east
side
shoot
from
the
left
eye
of
the
a
bee
line
from
the
tree
through
the
shot
fifty
feet
but
said
i
the
enigma
seems
still
in
as
bad
a
condition
as
ever
how
is
it
possible
to
extort
a
meaning
from
all
this
jargon
about
seats
and
hotels
i
confess
replied
legrand
that
the
matter
still
wears
a
serious
aspect
when
regarded
with
a
casual
glance
my
first
endeavor
was
to
divide
the
sentence
into
the
natural
division
intended
by
the
cryptographist
you
mean
to
punctuate
it
something
of
that
kind
but
how
was
it
possible
to
effect
this
i
reflected
that
it
had
been
a
with
the
writer
to
run
his
words
together
without
division
so
as
to
increase
the
difficulty
of
solution
now
a
not
man
in
pursuing
such
an
object
would
be
nearly
certain
to
overdo
the
matter
when
in
the
course
of
his
composition
he
arrived
at
a
break
in
his
subject
which
would
naturally
require
a
pause
or
a
point
he
would
be
exceedingly
apt
to
run
his
characters
at
this
place
more
than
usually
close
together
if
you
will
observe
the
in
the
present
instance
you
will
easily
detect
five
such
cases
of
unusual
crowding
acting
on
this
hint
i
made
the
division
thus
good
glass
in
the
bishop
hostel
in
the
devil
seat
degrees
and
thirteen
minutes
northeast
and
by
north
main
branch
seventh
limb
east
side
shoot
from
the
left
eye
of
the
a
bee
line
from
the
tree
through
the
shot
fifty
feet
even
this
division
said
i
leaves
me
still
in
the
dark
it
left
me
also
in
the
dark
replied
legrand
for
a
few
days
during
which
i
made
diligent
inquiry
in
the
neighborhood
of
sullivan
island
for
any
building
which
went
by
the
name
of
the
hotel
for
of
course
i
dropped
the
obsolete
word
gaining
no
information
on
the
subject
i
was
on
the
point
of
extending
my
sphere
of
search
and
proceeding
in
a
more
systematic
manner
when
one
morning
it
entered
into
my
head
quite
suddenly
that
this
hostel
might
have
some
reference
to
an
old
family
of
the
name
of
bessop
which
time
out
of
mind
had
held
possession
of
an
ancient
about
four
miles
to
the
northward
of
the
island
i
accordingly
went
over
to
the
plantation
and
reinstituted
my
inquiries
among
the
older
negroes
of
the
place
at
length
one
of
the
most
aged
of
the
women
said
that
she
had
heard
of
such
a
place
as
and
thought
that
she
could
guide
me
to
it
but
that
it
was
not
a
castle
nor
a
tavern
but
a
high
rock
i
offered
to
pay
her
well
for
her
trouble
and
after
some
demur
she
consented
to
accompany
me
to
the
spot
we
found
it
without
much
difficulty
when
dismissing
her
i
proceeded
to
examine
the
place
the
consisted
of
an
irregular
assemblage
of
cliffs
and
rocks
one
of
the
latter
being
quite
remarkable
for
its
height
as
well
as
for
its
insulated
and
artificial
appearance
i
clambered
to
its
apex
and
then
felt
much
at
a
loss
as
to
what
should
be
next
done
while
i
was
busied
in
reflection
my
eyes
fell
on
a
narrow
ledge
in
the
eastern
face
of
the
rock
perhaps
a
yard
below
the
summit
upon
which
i
stood
this
ledge
projected
about
eighteen
inches
and
was
not
more
than
a
foot
wide
while
a
niche
in
the
cliff
just
above
it
gave
it
a
rude
resemblance
to
one
of
the
chairs
used
by
our
ancestors
i
made
no
doubt
that
here
was
the
seat
alluded
to
in
the
and
now
i
seemed
to
grasp
the
full
secret
of
the
riddle
the
glass
i
knew
could
have
reference
to
nothing
but
a
telescope
for
the
word
is
rarely
employed
in
any
other
sense
by
seamen
now
here
i
at
once
saw
was
a
telescope
to
be
used
and
a
definite
point
of
view
no
from
which
to
use
it
nor
did
i
hesitate
to
believe
that
the
phrases
degrees
and
thirteen
minutes
and
and
by
north
were
intended
as
directions
for
the
levelling
of
the
glass
greatly
excited
by
these
discoveries
i
hurried
home
procured
a
telescope
and
returned
to
the
rock
i
let
myself
down
to
the
ledge
and
found
that
it
was
impossible
to
retain
a
seat
on
it
unless
in
one
particular
position
this
fact
confirmed
my
preconceived
idea
i
proceeded
to
use
the
glass
of
course
the
degrees
and
thirteen
minutes
could
allude
to
nothing
but
elevation
above
the
visible
horizon
since
the
horizontal
direction
was
clearly
indicated
by
the
words
and
by
north
this
latter
direction
i
at
once
established
by
means
of
a
then
pointing
the
glass
as
nearly
at
an
angle
of
degrees
of
elevation
as
i
could
do
it
by
guess
i
moved
it
cautiously
up
or
down
until
my
attention
was
arrested
by
a
circular
rift
or
opening
in
the
foliage
of
a
large
tree
that
its
fellows
in
the
distance
in
the
centre
of
this
rift
i
perceived
a
white
spot
but
could
not
at
first
distinguish
what
it
was
adjusting
the
focus
of
the
telescope
i
again
looked
and
now
made
it
out
to
be
a
human
skull
on
this
discovery
i
was
so
sanguine
as
to
consider
the
enigma
solved
for
the
phrase
branch
seventh
limb
east
side
could
refer
only
to
the
position
of
the
skull
on
the
tree
while
from
the
left
eye
of
the
admitted
also
of
but
one
interpretation
in
regard
to
a
search
for
buried
treasure
i
perceived
that
the
design
was
to
drop
a
bullet
from
the
left
eye
of
the
skull
and
that
a
or
in
other
words
a
straight
line
drawn
from
the
nearest
point
of
the
trunk
through
shot
or
the
spot
where
the
bullet
fell
and
thence
extended
to
a
distance
of
fifty
feet
would
indicate
a
definite
point
and
beneath
this
point
i
thought
it
at
least
that
a
deposit
of
value
lay
concealed
all
this
i
said
is
exceedingly
clear
and
although
ingenious
still
simple
and
explicit
when
you
left
the
bishop
hotel
what
then
why
having
carefully
taken
the
bearings
of
the
tree
i
turned
homewards
the
instant
that
i
left
devil
seat
however
the
circular
rift
vanished
nor
could
i
get
a
glimpse
of
it
afterwards
turn
as
i
would
what
seems
to
me
the
chief
ingenuity
in
this
whole
business
is
the
fact
for
repeated
experiment
has
convinced
me
it
a
fact
that
the
circular
opening
in
question
is
visible
from
no
other
attainable
point
of
view
than
that
afforded
by
the
narrow
ledge
on
the
face
of
the
rock
in
this
expedition
to
the
hotel
i
had
been
attended
by
jupiter
who
had
no
doubt
observed
for
some
weeks
past
the
abstraction
of
my
demeanor
and
took
especial
care
not
to
leave
me
alone
but
on
the
next
day
getting
up
very
early
i
contrived
to
give
him
the
slip
and
went
into
the
hills
in
search
of
the
tree
after
much
toil
i
found
it
when
i
came
home
at
night
my
valet
proposed
to
give
me
a
flogging
with
the
rest
of
the
adventure
i
believe
you
are
as
well
acquainted
as
myself
i
suppose
said
i
you
missed
the
spot
in
the
first
attempt
at
digging
through
jupiter
stupidity
in
letting
the
bug
fall
through
the
right
instead
of
through
the
left
eye
of
the
skull
precisely
this
mistake
made
a
difference
of
about
two
inches
and
a
half
in
the
that
is
to
say
in
the
position
of
the
peg
nearest
the
tree
and
had
the
treasure
been
the
the
error
would
have
been
of
little
moment
but
shot
together
with
the
nearest
point
of
the
tree
were
merely
two
points
for
the
establishment
of
a
line
of
direction
of
course
the
error
however
trivial
in
the
beginning
increased
as
we
proceeded
with
the
line
and
by
the
time
we
had
gone
fifty
feet
threw
us
quite
off
the
scent
but
for
my
convictions
that
treasure
was
here
somewhere
actually
buried
we
might
have
had
all
our
labor
in
vain
i
presume
the
fancy
of
of
letting
fall
a
bullet
through
the
skull
eye
was
suggested
to
kidd
by
the
piratical
flag
no
doubt
he
felt
a
kind
of
poetical
consistency
in
recovering
his
money
through
this
ominous
insignium
perhaps
so
still
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
common
sense
had
quite
as
much
to
do
with
the
matter
as
poetical
consistency
to
be
visible
from
the
devil
seat
it
was
necessary
that
the
object
if
small
should
be
and
there
is
nothing
like
your
human
skull
for
retaining
and
even
increasing
its
whiteness
under
exposure
to
all
vicissitudes
of
weather
but
your
grandiloquence
and
your
conduct
in
swinging
the
beetle
how
excessively
odd
i
was
sure
you
were
mad
and
why
did
you
insist
on
letting
fall
the
bug
instead
of
a
bullet
from
the
skull
why
to
be
frank
i
felt
somewhat
annoyed
by
your
evident
suspicions
touching
my
sanity
and
so
resolved
to
punish
you
quietly
in
my
own
way
by
a
little
bit
of
sober
mystification
for
this
reason
i
swung
the
beetle
and
for
this
reason
i
let
it
fall
from
the
tree
an
observation
of
yours
about
its
great
weight
suggested
the
latter
idea
yes
i
perceive
and
now
there
is
only
one
point
which
puzzles
me
what
are
we
to
make
of
the
skeletons
found
in
the
hole
that
is
a
question
i
am
no
more
able
to
answer
than
yourself
there
seems
however
only
one
plausible
way
of
accounting
for
them
and
yet
it
is
dreadful
to
believe
in
such
atrocity
as
my
suggestion
would
imply
it
is
clear
that
kidd
if
kidd
indeed
secreted
this
treasure
which
i
doubt
not
it
is
clear
that
he
must
have
had
assistance
in
the
labor
but
the
worst
of
this
labor
concluded
he
may
have
thought
it
expedient
to
remove
all
participants
in
his
secret
perhaps
a
couple
of
blows
with
a
mattock
were
sufficient
while
his
coadjutors
were
busy
in
the
pit
perhaps
it
required
a
dozen
who
shall
tell
the
purloined
letter
nil
sapientiæ
odiosius
acumine
nimio
seneca
at
paris
just
after
dark
one
gusty
evening
in
the
autumn
of
i
was
enjoying
the
twofold
luxury
of
meditation
and
a
meerschaum
in
company
with
my
friend
auguste
dupin
in
his
little
back
library
or
book
closet
no
rue
dunôt
faubourg
germain
for
one
hour
at
least
we
had
maintained
a
profound
silence
while
each
to
any
casual
observer
might
have
seemed
intently
and
exclusively
occupied
with
the
curling
eddies
of
smoke
that
oppressed
the
atmosphere
of
the
chamber
for
myself
however
i
was
mentally
discussing
certain
topics
which
had
formed
matter
for
conversation
between
us
at
an
earlier
period
of
the
evening
i
mean
the
affair
of
the
rue
morgue
and
the
mystery
attending
the
murder
of
marie
rogêt
i
looked
upon
it
therefore
as
something
of
a
coincidence
when
the
door
of
our
apartment
was
thrown
open
and
admitted
our
old
acquaintance
monsieur
g
the
prefect
of
the
parisian
police
we
gave
him
a
hearty
welcome
for
there
was
nearly
half
as
much
of
the
entertaining
as
of
the
contemptible
about
the
man
and
we
had
not
seen
him
for
several
years
we
had
been
sitting
in
the
dark
and
dupin
now
arose
for
the
purpose
of
lighting
a
lamp
but
sat
down
again
without
doing
so
upon
g
saying
that
he
had
called
to
consult
us
or
rather
to
ask
the
opinion
of
my
friend
about
some
official
business
which
had
occasioned
a
great
deal
of
trouble
if
it
is
any
point
requiring
reflection
observed
dupin
as
he
forebore
to
enkindle
the
wick
we
shall
examine
it
to
better
purpose
in
the
dark
that
is
another
of
your
odd
notions
said
the
prefect
who
had
a
fashion
of
calling
everything
odd
that
was
beyond
his
comprehension
and
thus
lived
amid
an
absolute
legion
of
oddities
very
true
said
dupin
as
he
supplied
his
visitor
with
a
pipe
and
rolled
towards
him
a
comfortable
chair
and
what
is
the
difficulty
now
i
asked
nothing
more
in
the
assassination
way
i
hope
oh
no
nothing
of
that
nature
the
fact
is
the
business
is
simple
indeed
and
i
make
no
doubt
that
we
can
manage
it
sufficiently
well
ourselves
but
then
i
thought
dupin
would
like
to
hear
the
details
of
it
because
it
is
so
excessively
simple
and
odd
said
dupin
why
yes
and
not
exactly
that
either
the
fact
is
we
have
all
been
a
good
deal
puzzled
because
the
affair
so
simple
and
yet
baffles
us
altogether
perhaps
it
is
the
very
simplicity
of
the
thing
which
puts
you
at
fault
said
my
friend
what
nonsense
you
talk
replied
the
prefect
laughing
heartily
perhaps
the
mystery
is
a
little
plain
said
dupin
oh
good
heavens
who
ever
heard
of
such
an
idea
a
little
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ho
ho
ho
roared
our
visitor
profoundly
amused
o
dupin
you
will
be
the
death
of
me
yet
and
what
after
all
the
matter
on
hand
i
asked
why
i
will
tell
you
replied
the
prefect
as
he
gave
a
long
steady
and
contemplative
puff
and
settle
himself
in
his
chair
i
will
tell
you
in
a
few
words
but
before
i
begin
let
me
caution
you
that
this
is
an
affair
demanding
the
greatest
secrecy
and
that
i
should
most
probably
lose
the
position
i
now
hold
were
it
known
that
i
confided
it
to
any
one
proceed
said
i
or
not
said
dupin
well
then
i
have
received
personal
information
from
a
very
high
quarter
that
a
certain
document
of
the
last
importance
has
been
purloined
from
the
royal
apartments
the
individual
who
purloined
it
is
known
this
beyond
a
doubt
he
was
seen
to
take
it
it
is
known
also
that
it
still
remains
in
his
possession
how
is
this
known
asked
dupin
it
is
clearly
inferred
replied
the
prefect
from
the
nature
of
the
document
and
from
the
of
certain
results
which
would
at
once
arise
from
its
passing
of
the
robber
possession
that
is
to
say
from
his
employing
it
as
he
must
design
in
the
end
to
employ
it
be
a
little
more
explicit
i
said
well
i
may
venture
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
paper
gives
its
holder
a
certain
power
in
a
certain
quarter
where
such
power
is
immensely
valuable
the
prefect
was
fond
of
the
cant
of
diplomacy
still
i
do
not
quite
understand
said
dupin
no
well
the
disclosure
of
the
document
to
a
third
person
who
shall
be
nameless
would
bring
in
question
the
honor
of
a
personage
of
most
exalted
station
and
this
fact
gives
the
holder
of
the
document
an
ascendency
over
the
illustrious
personage
whose
honor
and
peace
are
so
jeopardized
but
this
ascendency
i
interposed
would
depend
upon
the
knowledge
of
the
loser
knowledge
of
the
robber
who
would
dare
the
thief
said
g
is
the
minister
d
who
dares
all
things
those
unbecoming
as
well
as
those
becoming
a
man
the
method
of
the
theft
was
not
less
ingenious
than
bold
the
document
in
question
a
letter
to
be
frank
had
been
received
by
the
personage
robbed
while
alone
in
the
royal
boudoir
during
its
perusal
she
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
the
other
exalted
personage
from
whom
especially
it
was
her
wish
to
conceal
it
after
a
hurried
and
vain
endeavor
to
thrust
it
in
a
drawer
she
was
forced
to
place
it
open
as
it
was
upon
a
table
the
address
however
was
uppermost
and
the
contents
thus
unexposed
the
letter
escaped
notice
at
this
juncture
enters
the
minister
d
his
lynx
eye
immediately
perceives
the
paper
recognizes
the
handwriting
of
the
address
observes
the
confusion
of
the
personage
addressed
and
fathoms
her
secret
after
some
business
transactions
hurried
through
in
his
ordinary
manner
he
produces
a
letter
somewhat
similar
to
the
one
in
question
opens
it
pretends
to
read
it
and
then
places
it
in
close
juxtaposition
to
the
other
again
he
converses
for
some
fifteen
minutes
upon
the
public
affairs
at
length
in
taking
leave
he
takes
also
from
the
table
the
letter
to
which
he
had
no
claim
its
rightful
owner
saw
but
of
course
dared
not
call
attention
to
the
act
in
the
presence
of
the
third
personage
who
stood
at
her
elbow
the
minister
decamped
leaving
his
own
letter
one
of
no
importance
upon
the
table
here
then
said
dupin
to
me
you
have
precisely
what
you
demand
to
make
the
ascendancy
complete
the
robber
knowledge
of
the
knowledge
of
the
robber
yes
replied
the
prefect
and
the
power
thus
attained
has
for
some
months
past
been
wielded
for
political
purposes
to
a
very
dangerous
extent
the
personage
robbed
is
more
thoroughly
convinced
every
day
of
the
necessity
of
reclaiming
her
letter
but
this
of
course
can
not
be
done
openly
in
fine
driven
to
despair
she
has
committed
the
matter
to
me
than
whom
said
dupin
amid
a
perfect
whirlwind
of
smoke
no
more
sagacious
agent
could
i
suppose
be
desired
or
even
imagined
you
flatter
me
replied
the
prefect
but
it
is
possible
that
some
such
opinion
may
have
been
entertained
it
is
clear
said
i
as
you
observe
that
the
letter
is
still
in
possession
of
the
minister
since
it
is
this
possession
and
not
any
employment
of
the
letter
which
bestows
the
power
with
the
employment
the
power
departs
true
said
g
and
upon
this
conviction
i
proceeded
my
first
care
was
to
make
thorough
search
of
the
minister
hotel
and
here
my
chief
embarrassment
lay
in
the
necessity
of
searching
without
his
knowledge
beyond
all
things
i
have
been
warned
of
the
danger
which
would
result
from
giving
him
reason
to
suspect
our
design
but
said
i
you
are
quite
in
these
investigations
the
parisian
police
have
done
this
thing
often
before
oh
yes
and
for
this
reason
i
did
not
despair
the
habits
of
the
minister
gave
me
too
a
great
advantage
he
is
frequently
absent
from
home
all
night
his
servants
are
by
no
means
numerous
they
sleep
at
a
distance
from
their
master
apartment
and
being
chiefly
neapolitans
are
readily
made
drunk
i
have
keys
as
you
know
with
which
i
can
open
any
chamber
or
cabinet
in
paris
for
three
months
a
night
has
not
passed
during
the
greater
part
of
which
i
have
not
been
engaged
personally
in
ransacking
the
d
hotel
my
honor
is
interested
and
to
mention
a
great
secret
the
reward
is
enormous
so
i
did
not
abandon
the
search
until
i
had
become
fully
satisfied
the
thief
is
a
more
astute
man
than
myself
i
fancy
that
i
have
investigated
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
premises
in
which
it
is
possible
that
the
paper
can
be
concealed
but
is
it
not
possible
i
suggested
that
although
the
letter
may
be
in
possession
of
the
minister
as
it
unquestionably
is
he
may
have
concealed
it
elsewhere
than
upon
his
own
premises
this
is
barely
possible
said
dupin
the
present
peculiar
condition
of
affairs
at
court
and
especially
of
those
intrigues
in
which
d
is
known
to
be
involved
would
render
the
instant
availability
of
the
document
its
susceptibility
of
being
produced
at
a
moment
notice
a
point
of
nearly
equal
importance
with
its
possession
its
susceptibility
of
being
produced
said
i
that
is
to
say
of
being
said
dupin
true
i
observed
the
paper
is
clearly
then
upon
the
premises
as
for
its
being
upon
the
person
of
the
minister
we
may
consider
that
as
out
of
the
question
entirely
said
the
prefect
he
has
been
twice
waylaid
as
if
by
footpads
and
his
person
rigorously
searched
under
my
own
inspection
you
might
have
spared
yourself
this
trouble
said
dupin
d
i
presume
is
not
altogether
a
fool
and
if
not
must
have
anticipated
these
waylayings
as
a
matter
of
course
not
a
fool
said
g
but
then
he
a
poet
which
i
take
to
be
only
one
remove
from
a
fool
true
said
dupin
after
a
long
and
thoughtful
whiff
from
his
meerschaum
although
i
have
been
guilty
of
certain
doggerel
myself
suppose
you
detail
said
i
the
particulars
of
your
search
why
the
fact
is
we
took
our
time
and
we
searched
i
have
had
long
experience
in
these
affairs
i
took
the
entire
building
room
by
room
devoting
the
nights
of
a
whole
week
to
each
we
examined
first
the
furniture
of
each
apartment
we
opened
every
possible
drawer
and
i
presume
you
know
that
to
a
properly
trained
police
agent
such
a
thing
as
a
drawer
is
impossible
any
man
is
a
dolt
who
permits
a
drawer
to
escape
him
in
a
search
of
this
kind
the
thing
is
plain
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
bulk
of
space
to
be
accounted
for
in
every
cabinet
then
we
have
accurate
rules
the
fiftieth
part
of
a
line
could
not
escape
us
after
the
cabinets
we
took
the
chairs
the
cushions
we
probed
with
the
fine
long
needles
you
have
seen
me
employ
from
the
tables
we
removed
the
tops
why
so
sometimes
the
top
of
a
table
or
other
similarly
arranged
piece
of
furniture
is
removed
by
the
person
wishing
to
conceal
an
article
then
the
leg
is
excavated
the
article
deposited
within
the
cavity
and
the
top
replaced
the
bottoms
and
tops
of
bedposts
are
employed
in
the
same
way
but
could
not
the
cavity
be
detected
by
sounding
i
asked
by
no
means
if
when
the
article
is
deposited
a
sufficient
wadding
of
cotton
be
placed
around
it
besides
in
our
case
we
were
obliged
to
proceed
without
noise
but
you
could
not
have
removed
you
could
not
have
taken
to
pieces
articles
of
furniture
in
which
it
would
have
been
possible
to
make
a
deposit
in
the
manner
you
mention
a
letter
may
be
compressed
into
a
thin
spiral
roll
not
differing
much
in
shape
or
bulk
from
a
large
and
in
this
form
it
might
be
inserted
into
the
rung
of
a
chair
for
example
you
did
not
take
to
pieces
all
the
chairs
certainly
not
but
we
did
better
we
examined
the
rungs
of
every
chair
in
the
hotel
and
indeed
the
jointings
of
every
description
of
furniture
by
the
aid
of
a
most
powerful
microscope
had
there
been
any
traces
of
recent
disturbance
we
should
not
have
failed
to
detect
it
instantly
a
single
grain
of
for
example
would
have
been
as
obvious
as
an
apple
any
disorder
in
the
gluing
any
unusual
gaping
in
the
joints
would
have
sufficed
to
insure
detection
i
presume
you
looked
to
the
mirrors
between
the
boards
and
the
plates
and
you
probed
the
beds
and
the
bedclothes
as
well
as
the
curtains
and
carpets
that
of
course
and
when
we
had
absolutely
completed
every
particle
of
the
furniture
in
this
way
then
we
examined
the
house
itself
we
divided
its
entire
surface
into
compartments
which
we
numbered
so
that
none
might
be
missed
then
we
scrutinized
each
individual
square
inch
throughout
the
premises
including
the
two
houses
immediately
adjoining
with
the
microscope
as
before
the
two
houses
adjoining
i
exclaimed
you
must
have
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
we
had
but
the
reward
offered
is
prodigious
you
include
the
about
the
houses
all
the
grounds
are
paved
with
bricks
they
gave
us
comparatively
little
trouble
we
examined
the
moss
between
the
bricks
and
found
it
undisturbed
you
looked
among
d
papers
of
course
and
into
the
books
of
the
library
certainly
we
opened
every
package
and
parcel
we
not
only
opened
every
book
but
we
turned
over
every
leaf
in
each
volume
not
contenting
ourselves
with
a
mere
shake
according
to
the
fashion
of
some
of
our
police
officers
we
also
measured
the
thickness
of
every
with
the
most
accurate
admeasurement
and
applied
to
each
the
most
jealous
scrutiny
of
the
microscope
had
any
of
the
bindings
been
recently
meddled
with
it
would
have
been
utterly
impossible
that
the
fact
should
have
escaped
observation
some
five
or
six
volumes
just
from
the
hands
of
the
binder
we
carefully
probed
longitudinally
with
the
needles
you
explored
the
floors
beneath
the
carpets
beyond
doubt
we
removed
every
carpet
and
examined
the
boards
with
the
microscope
and
the
paper
on
the
walls
yes
you
looked
into
the
cellars
we
did
then
i
said
you
have
been
making
a
miscalculation
and
the
letter
is
upon
the
premises
as
you
suppose
i
fear
you
are
right
there
said
the
prefect
and
now
dupin
what
would
you
advise
me
to
do
to
make
a
thorough
of
the
premises
that
is
absolutely
needless
replied
g
i
am
not
more
sure
that
i
breathe
than
i
am
that
the
letter
is
not
at
the
hotel
i
have
no
better
advice
to
give
you
said
dupin
you
have
of
course
an
accurate
description
of
the
letter
oh
yes
and
here
the
prefect
producing
a
proceeded
to
read
aloud
a
minute
account
of
the
internal
and
especially
of
the
external
appearance
of
the
missing
document
soon
after
finishing
the
perusal
of
this
description
he
took
his
departure
more
entirely
depressed
in
spirits
than
i
had
ever
known
the
good
gentleman
before
in
about
a
month
afterwards
he
paid
us
another
visit
and
found
us
occupied
very
nearly
as
before
he
took
a
pipe
and
a
chair
and
entered
into
some
ordinary
conversation
at
length
i
said
well
but
g
what
of
the
purloined
letter
i
presume
you
have
at
last
made
up
your
mind
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
overreaching
the
minister
confound
him
say
i
yes
i
made
the
however
as
dupin
suggested
but
it
was
all
labor
lost
as
i
knew
it
would
be
how
much
was
the
reward
offered
did
you
say
asked
dupin
why
a
very
great
deal
a
liberal
reward
i
do
like
to
say
how
much
precisely
but
one
thing
i
say
that
i
would
mind
giving
my
individual
check
for
fifty
thousand
francs
to
any
one
who
could
obtain
me
that
letter
the
fact
is
it
is
becoming
of
more
and
more
importance
every
day
and
the
reward
has
been
lately
doubled
if
it
were
trebled
however
i
could
do
no
more
than
i
have
done
why
yes
said
dupin
drawlingly
between
the
whiffs
of
his
meerschaum
i
really
think
g
you
have
not
exerted
yourself
to
the
utmost
in
this
matter
you
might
do
a
little
more
i
think
eh
how
in
what
way
why
puff
puff
you
might
puff
puff
employ
counsel
in
the
matter
eh
puff
puff
puff
do
you
remember
the
story
they
tell
of
abernethy
no
hang
abernethy
to
be
sure
hang
him
and
welcome
but
once
upon
a
time
a
certain
rich
miser
conceived
the
design
of
sponging
upon
this
abernethy
for
a
medical
opinion
getting
up
for
this
purpose
an
ordinary
conversation
in
a
private
company
he
insinuated
his
case
to
the
physician
as
that
of
an
imaginary
individual
will
suppose
said
the
miser
his
symptoms
are
such
and
such
now
doctor
what
would
have
directed
him
to
take
said
abernethy
take
to
be
sure
but
said
the
prefect
a
little
discomposed
i
am
willing
to
take
advice
and
to
pay
for
it
i
would
give
fifty
thousand
francs
to
any
one
who
would
aid
me
in
the
matter
in
that
case
replied
dupin
opening
a
drawer
and
producing
a
you
may
as
well
fill
me
up
a
check
for
the
amount
mentioned
when
you
have
signed
it
i
will
hand
you
the
letter
i
was
astounded
the
prefect
appeared
absolutely
for
some
minutes
he
remained
speechless
and
motionless
looking
incredulously
at
my
friend
with
open
mouth
and
eyes
that
seemed
starting
from
their
sockets
then
apparently
recovering
himself
in
some
measure
he
seized
a
pen
and
after
several
pauses
and
vacant
stares
finally
filled
up
and
signed
a
check
for
fifty
thousand
francs
and
handed
it
across
the
table
to
dupin
the
latter
examined
it
carefully
and
deposited
it
in
his
pocketbook
then
unlocking
an
took
thence
a
letter
and
gave
it
to
the
prefect
this
functionary
grasped
it
in
a
perfect
agony
of
joy
opened
it
with
a
trembling
hand
cast
a
rapid
glance
at
its
contents
and
then
scrambling
and
struggling
to
the
door
rushed
at
length
unceremoniously
from
the
room
and
from
the
house
without
having
uttered
a
syllable
since
dupin
had
requested
him
to
fill
up
the
check
when
he
had
gone
my
friend
entered
into
some
explanations
the
parisian
police
he
said
are
exceedingly
able
in
their
way
they
are
persevering
ingenious
cunning
and
thoroughly
versed
in
the
knowledge
which
their
duties
seem
chiefly
to
demand
thus
when
g
detailed
to
us
his
mode
of
searching
the
premises
at
the
hotel
d
i
felt
entire
confidence
in
his
having
made
a
satisfactory
investigation
so
far
as
his
labors
extended
so
far
as
his
labors
extended
said
i
yes
said
dupin
the
measures
adopted
were
not
only
the
best
of
their
kind
but
carried
out
to
absolute
perfection
had
the
letter
been
deposited
within
the
range
of
their
search
these
fellows
would
beyond
a
question
have
found
it
i
merely
laughed
but
he
seemed
quite
serious
in
all
that
he
said
the
measures
then
he
continued
were
good
in
their
kind
and
well
executed
their
defect
lay
in
their
being
inapplicable
to
the
case
and
to
the
man
a
certain
set
of
highly
ingenious
resources
are
with
the
prefect
a
sort
of
procrustean
bed
to
which
he
forcibly
adapts
his
designs
but
he
perpetually
errs
by
being
too
deep
or
too
shallow
for
the
matter
in
hand
and
many
a
schoolboy
is
a
better
reasoner
than
he
i
knew
one
about
eight
years
of
age
whose
success
at
guessing
in
the
game
of
and
odd
attracted
universal
admiration
this
game
simple
and
is
played
with
marbles
one
player
holds
in
his
hand
a
number
of
these
toys
and
demands
of
another
whether
that
number
is
even
or
odd
if
the
guess
is
right
the
guesser
wins
one
if
wrong
he
loses
one
the
boy
to
whom
i
allude
won
all
the
marbles
of
the
school
of
course
he
had
some
principle
of
guessing
and
this
lay
in
mere
observation
and
admeasurement
of
the
astuteness
of
his
opponents
for
example
an
arrant
simpleton
is
his
opponent
and
holding
up
his
closed
hand
asks
they
even
or
odd
our
schoolboy
replies
and
loses
but
upon
the
second
trial
he
wins
for
he
then
says
to
himself
simpleton
had
them
even
upon
the
first
trial
and
his
amount
of
cunning
is
just
sufficient
to
make
him
have
them
odd
upon
the
second
i
will
therefore
guess
odd
he
guesses
odd
and
wins
now
with
a
simpleton
a
degree
above
the
first
he
would
have
reasoned
thus
fellow
finds
that
in
the
first
instance
i
guessed
odd
and
in
the
second
he
will
propose
to
himself
upon
the
first
impulse
a
simple
variation
from
even
to
odd
as
did
the
first
simpleton
but
then
a
second
thought
will
suggest
that
this
is
too
simple
a
variation
and
finally
he
will
decide
upon
putting
it
even
as
before
i
will
therefore
guess
even
he
guesses
even
and
wins
now
this
mode
of
reasoning
in
the
schoolboy
whom
his
fellows
term
what
in
its
last
analysis
is
it
it
is
merely
i
said
an
identification
of
the
reasoner
intellect
with
that
of
his
opponent
it
is
said
dupin
and
upon
inquiring
of
the
boy
by
what
means
he
effected
the
identification
in
which
his
success
consisted
i
received
answer
as
follows
i
wish
to
find
out
how
wise
or
how
stupid
or
how
good
or
how
wicked
is
any
one
or
what
are
his
thoughts
at
the
moment
i
fashion
the
expression
of
my
face
as
accurately
as
possible
in
accordance
with
the
expression
of
his
and
then
wait
to
see
what
thoughts
or
sentiments
arise
in
my
mind
or
heart
as
if
to
match
or
correspond
with
the
expression
this
response
of
the
schoolboy
lies
at
the
bottom
of
all
the
spurious
profundity
which
has
been
attributed
to
rochefoucauld
to
la
bruyère
to
machiavelli
and
to
campanella
and
the
identification
i
said
of
the
reasoner
intellect
with
that
of
his
opponent
depends
if
i
understand
you
aright
upon
the
accuracy
with
which
the
opponent
intellect
is
admeasured
for
its
practical
value
it
depends
upon
this
replied
dupin
and
the
prefect
and
his
cohort
fail
so
frequently
first
by
default
of
this
identification
and
secondly
by
or
rather
through
of
the
intellect
with
which
they
are
engaged
they
consider
only
their
ideas
of
ingenuity
and
in
searching
for
anything
hidden
advert
only
to
the
modes
in
which
would
have
hidden
it
they
are
right
in
this
much
that
their
own
ingenuity
is
a
faithful
representative
of
that
of
but
when
the
cunning
of
the
individual
felon
is
diverse
in
character
from
their
own
the
felon
foils
them
of
course
this
always
happens
when
it
is
above
their
own
and
very
usually
when
it
is
below
they
have
no
variation
of
principle
in
their
investigations
at
best
when
urged
by
some
unusual
emergency
by
some
extraordinary
reward
they
extend
or
exaggerate
their
old
modes
of
without
touching
their
principles
what
for
example
in
this
case
of
d
has
been
done
to
vary
the
principle
of
action
what
is
all
this
boring
and
probing
and
sounding
and
scrutinizing
with
the
microscope
and
dividing
the
surface
of
the
building
into
registered
square
inches
what
is
it
all
but
an
exaggeration
the
of
the
one
principle
or
set
of
principles
of
search
which
are
based
upon
the
one
set
of
notions
regarding
human
ingenuity
to
which
the
prefect
in
the
long
routine
of
his
duty
has
been
accustomed
do
you
not
see
he
has
taken
it
for
granted
that
men
proceed
to
conceal
a
letter
not
exactly
in
a
bored
in
a
chair
leg
but
at
least
in
hole
or
corner
suggested
by
the
same
tenor
of
thought
which
would
urge
a
man
to
secrete
a
letter
in
a
bored
in
a
and
do
you
not
see
also
that
such
nooks
for
concealment
are
adapted
only
for
ordinary
occasions
and
would
be
adopted
only
by
ordinary
intellects
for
in
all
cases
of
concealment
a
disposal
of
the
article
concealed
a
disposal
of
it
in
this
manner
is
in
the
very
first
instance
presumable
and
presumed
and
thus
its
discovery
depends
not
at
all
upon
the
acumen
but
altogether
upon
the
mere
care
patience
and
determination
of
the
seekers
and
where
the
case
is
of
importance
or
what
amounts
to
the
same
thing
in
policial
eyes
when
the
reward
is
of
magnitude
the
qualities
in
question
have
been
known
to
fail
you
will
now
understand
what
i
meant
in
suggesting
that
had
the
purloined
letter
been
hidden
anywhere
within
the
limits
of
the
examination
in
other
words
had
the
principle
of
its
concealment
been
comprehended
within
the
principles
of
the
prefect
its
discovery
would
have
been
a
matter
altogether
beyond
question
this
functionary
however
has
been
thoroughly
mystified
and
the
remote
source
of
his
defeat
lies
in
the
supposition
that
the
minister
is
a
fool
because
he
has
acquired
renown
as
a
poet
all
fools
are
poets
this
the
prefect
and
he
is
merely
guilty
of
a
distributio
in
thence
inferring
that
all
poets
are
fools
but
is
this
really
the
poet
i
asked
there
are
two
brothers
i
know
and
both
have
attained
reputation
in
letters
the
minister
i
believe
has
written
learnedly
on
the
differential
calculus
he
is
a
mathematician
and
no
poet
you
are
mistaken
i
know
him
well
he
is
both
as
poet
mathematician
he
would
reason
well
as
mere
mathematician
he
could
not
have
reasoned
at
all
and
thus
would
have
been
at
the
mercy
of
the
prefect
you
surprise
me
i
said
by
these
opinions
which
have
been
contradicted
by
the
voice
of
the
world
you
do
not
mean
to
set
at
naught
the
idea
of
centuries
the
mathematical
reason
has
long
been
regarded
as
reason
à
replied
dupin
quoting
from
chamfort
toute
idée
publique
toute
convention
reçue
est
une
sottise
car
elle
a
convenue
au
plus
grand
the
mathematicians
i
grant
you
have
done
their
best
to
promulgate
the
popular
error
to
which
you
allude
and
which
is
none
the
less
an
error
for
its
promulgation
as
truth
with
an
art
worthy
a
better
cause
for
example
they
have
insinuated
the
term
into
application
to
algebra
the
french
are
the
originators
of
this
particular
deception
but
if
a
term
is
of
any
importance
if
words
derive
any
value
from
applicability
then
conveys
about
as
much
as
in
latin
implies
or
set
of
honorable
men
you
have
a
quarrel
on
hand
i
see
said
i
with
some
of
the
algebraists
of
paris
but
proceed
i
dispute
the
availability
and
thus
the
value
of
that
reason
which
is
cultivated
in
any
especial
form
other
than
the
abstractly
logical
i
dispute
in
particular
the
reason
educed
by
mathematical
study
the
mathematics
are
the
science
of
form
and
quantity
mathematical
reasoning
is
merely
logic
applied
to
observation
upon
form
and
quantity
the
great
error
lies
in
supposing
that
even
the
truths
of
what
is
called
algebra
are
abstract
or
general
truths
and
this
error
is
so
egregious
that
i
am
confounded
at
the
universality
with
which
it
has
been
received
mathematical
axioms
are
axioms
of
general
truth
what
is
true
of
of
form
and
quantity
is
often
grossly
false
in
regard
to
morals
for
example
in
this
latter
science
it
is
very
usually
that
the
aggregated
parts
are
equal
to
the
whole
in
chemistry
also
the
axiom
fails
in
the
consideration
of
motive
it
fails
for
two
motives
each
of
a
given
value
have
not
necessarily
a
value
when
united
equal
to
the
sum
of
their
values
apart
there
are
numerous
other
mathematical
truths
which
are
only
truths
within
the
limits
of
but
the
mathematician
argues
from
his
through
habit
as
if
they
were
of
an
absolutely
general
applicability
as
the
world
indeed
imagines
them
to
be
bryant
in
his
very
learned
mentions
an
analogous
source
of
error
when
he
says
that
the
pagan
fables
are
not
believed
yet
we
forget
ourselves
continually
and
make
inferences
from
them
as
existing
realities
with
the
algebraists
however
who
are
pagans
themselves
the
fables
believed
and
the
inferences
are
made
not
so
much
through
lapse
of
memory
as
through
an
unaccountable
addling
of
the
brains
in
short
i
neyer
yet
encountered
the
mere
mathematician
who
could
be
trusted
out
of
equal
roots
or
one
who
did
not
clandestinely
hold
it
as
a
point
of
his
faith
that
was
absolutely
and
unconditionally
equal
to
say
to
one
of
these
gentlemen
by
way
of
experiment
if
you
please
that
you
believe
occasions
may
occur
where
is
altogether
equal
to
and
having
made
him
understand
what
you
mean
get
out
of
his
reach
as
speedily
as
convenient
for
beyond
doubt
he
will
endeavor
to
knock
you
down
i
mean
to
say
continued
dupin
while
i
merely
laughed
at
his
last
observations
that
if
the
minister
had
been
no
more
than
a
mathematician
the
prefect
would
have
been
under
no
necessity
of
giving
me
this
check
i
knew
him
however
as
both
mathematician
and
poet
and
my
measures
were
adapted
to
his
capacity
with
reference
to
the
circumstances
by
which
he
was
surrounded
i
knew
him
as
courtier
too
and
as
a
bold
such
a
man
i
considered
could
not
fail
to
be
aware
of
the
ordinary
policial
modes
of
action
he
could
not
have
failed
to
anticipate
and
events
have
proved
that
he
did
not
fail
to
anticipate
the
waylayings
to
which
he
was
subjected
he
must
have
foreseen
i
reflected
the
secret
investigations
of
his
premises
his
frequent
absences
from
home
at
night
which
were
hailed
by
the
prefect
as
certain
aids
to
his
success
i
regarded
only
as
ruses
to
afford
opportunity
for
thorough
search
to
the
police
and
thus
the
sooner
to
impress
them
with
the
conviction
to
which
g
in
fact
did
finally
arrive
the
conviction
that
the
letter
was
not
upon
the
premises
i
felt
also
that
the
whole
train
of
thought
which
i
was
at
some
pains
in
detailing
to
you
just
now
concerning
the
invariable
principle
of
policial
action
in
searches
for
articles
concealed
i
felt
that
this
whole
train
of
thought
would
necessarily
pass
through
the
mind
of
the
minister
it
would
imperatively
lead
him
to
despise
all
the
ordinary
of
concealment
could
not
i
reflected
be
so
weak
as
not
to
see
that
the
most
intricate
and
remote
recess
of
his
hotel
would
be
as
open
as
his
commonest
closets
to
the
eyes
to
the
probes
to
the
gimlets
and
to
the
microscopes
of
the
prefect
i
saw
in
fine
that
he
would
be
driven
as
a
matter
of
course
to
if
not
deliberately
induced
to
it
as
a
matter
of
choice
you
will
remember
perhaps
how
desperately
the
prefect
laughed
when
i
suggested
upon
our
first
interview
that
it
was
just
possible
this
mystery
troubled
him
so
much
on
account
of
its
being
so
yes
said
i
i
remember
his
merriment
well
i
really
thought
he
would
have
fallen
into
convulsions
the
material
world
continued
dupin
abounds
with
very
strict
analogies
to
the
immaterial
and
thus
some
color
of
truth
has
been
given
to
the
rhetorical
dogma
that
metaphor
or
simile
may
be
made
to
strengthen
an
argument
as
well
as
to
embellish
a
description
the
principle
of
the
for
example
seems
to
be
identical
in
physics
and
metaphysics
it
is
not
more
true
in
the
former
that
a
large
body
is
with
more
difficulty
set
in
motion
than
a
smaller
one
and
that
its
subsequent
momentum
is
commensurate
with
this
difficulty
than
it
is
in
the
latter
that
intellects
of
the
vaster
capacity
while
more
forcible
more
constant
and
more
eventful
in
their
movements
than
those
of
inferior
grade
are
yet
the
less
readily
moved
and
more
embarrassed
and
full
of
hesitation
in
the
first
few
steps
of
their
progress
again
have
you
ever
noticed
which
of
the
street
signs
over
the
are
the
most
attractive
of
attention
i
have
never
given
the
matter
a
thought
i
said
there
is
a
game
of
puzzles
he
resumed
which
is
played
upon
a
map
one
party
playing
requires
another
to
find
a
given
word
the
name
of
town
river
state
or
empire
any
word
in
short
upon
the
motley
and
perplexed
surface
of
the
chart
a
novice
in
the
game
generally
seeks
to
embarrass
his
opponents
by
giving
them
the
most
minutely
lettered
names
but
the
adept
selects
such
words
as
stretch
in
large
characters
from
one
end
of
the
chart
to
the
other
these
like
the
lettered
signs
and
placards
of
the
street
escape
observation
by
dint
of
being
excessively
obvious
and
here
the
physical
oversight
is
precisely
analogous
with
the
moral
inapprehension
by
which
the
intellect
suffers
to
pass
unnoticed
those
considerations
which
are
too
obtrusively
and
too
palpably
but
this
is
a
point
it
appears
somewhat
above
or
beneath
the
understanding
of
the
prefect
he
never
once
thought
it
probable
or
possible
that
the
minister
had
deposited
the
letter
immediately
beneath
the
nose
of
the
whole
world
by
way
of
best
preventing
any
portion
of
that
world
from
perceiving
it
but
the
more
i
reflected
upon
the
daring
dashing
and
discriminating
ingenuity
of
d
upon
the
fact
that
the
document
must
always
have
been
hand
if
he
intended
to
use
it
to
good
purpose
and
upon
the
decisive
evidence
obtained
by
the
prefect
that
it
was
not
hidden
within
the
limits
of
that
dignitary
ordinary
search
the
more
satisfied
i
became
that
to
conceal
this
letter
the
minister
had
resorted
to
the
comprehensive
and
sagacious
expedient
of
not
attempting
to
conceal
it
at
all
full
of
these
ideas
i
prepared
myself
with
a
pair
of
green
spectacles
and
called
one
fine
morning
quite
by
accident
at
the
ministerial
hotel
i
found
d
at
home
yawning
lounging
and
dawdling
as
usual
and
pretending
to
be
in
the
last
extremity
of
ennui
he
is
perhaps
the
most
really
energetic
human
being
now
alive
but
that
is
only
when
nobody
sees
him
to
be
even
with
him
i
complained
of
my
weak
eyes
and
lamented
the
necessity
of
the
spectacles
under
cover
of
which
i
cautiously
and
thoroughly
surveyed
the
apartment
while
seemingly
intent
only
upon
the
conversation
of
my
host
i
paid
especial
attention
to
a
large
near
which
he
sat
and
upon
which
lay
confusedly
some
miscellaneous
letters
and
other
papers
with
one
or
two
musical
instruments
and
a
few
books
here
however
after
a
long
and
very
deliberate
scrutiny
i
saw
nothing
to
excite
particular
suspicion
at
length
my
eyes
in
going
the
circuit
of
the
room
fell
upon
a
trumpery
filigree
of
pasteboard
that
hung
dangling
by
a
dirty
blue
ribbon
from
a
little
brass
knob
just
beneath
the
middle
of
the
mantelpiece
in
this
rack
which
had
three
or
four
compartments
were
five
or
six
visiting
cards
and
a
solitary
letter
this
last
was
much
soiled
and
crumpled
it
was
torn
nearly
in
two
across
the
middle
as
if
a
design
in
the
first
instance
to
tear
it
entirely
up
as
worthless
had
been
altered
or
stayed
in
the
second
it
had
a
large
black
seal
bearing
the
d
cipher
conspicuously
and
was
addressed
in
a
diminutive
female
hand
to
d
the
minister
himself
it
was
thrust
carelessly
and
even
as
it
seemed
contemptuously
into
one
of
the
upper
divisions
of
the
rack
no
sooner
had
i
glanced
at
this
letter
than
i
concluded
it
to
be
that
of
which
i
was
in
search
to
be
sure
it
was
to
all
appearance
radically
different
from
the
one
of
which
the
prefect
had
read
us
so
minute
a
description
here
the
seal
was
large
and
black
with
the
d
cipher
there
it
was
small
and
red
with
the
ducal
arms
of
the
s
family
here
the
address
to
the
minister
was
diminutive
and
feminine
there
the
superscription
to
a
certain
royal
personage
was
markedly
bold
and
decided
the
size
alone
formed
a
point
of
correspondence
but
then
the
of
these
differences
which
was
excessive
the
dirt
the
soiled
and
torn
condition
of
the
paper
so
inconsistent
with
the
methodical
habits
of
d
and
so
suggestive
of
a
design
to
delude
the
beholder
into
an
idea
of
the
worthlessness
of
the
document
these
things
together
with
the
hyperobtrusive
situation
of
this
document
full
in
the
view
of
every
visitor
and
thus
exactly
in
accordance
with
the
conclusions
to
which
i
had
previously
arrived
these
things
i
say
were
strongly
corroborative
of
suspicion
in
one
who
came
with
the
intention
to
suspect
i
protracted
my
visit
as
long
as
possible
and
while
i
maintained
a
most
animated
discussion
with
the
minister
upon
a
topic
which
i
knew
well
had
never
failed
to
interest
and
excite
him
i
kept
my
attention
really
riveted
upon
the
letter
in
this
examination
i
committed
to
memory
its
external
appearance
and
arrangement
in
the
rack
and
also
fell
at
length
upon
a
discovery
which
set
at
rest
whatever
trivial
doubt
i
might
have
entertained
in
scrutinizing
the
edges
of
the
paper
i
observed
them
to
be
more
than
seemed
necessary
they
presented
the
appearance
which
is
manifested
when
a
stiff
paper
having
been
once
folded
and
pressed
with
a
folder
is
refolded
in
a
reversed
direction
in
the
same
creases
or
edges
which
had
formed
the
original
fold
this
discovery
was
sufficient
it
was
clear
to
me
that
the
letter
had
been
turned
as
a
glove
inside
out
and
i
bade
the
minister
and
took
my
departure
at
once
leaving
a
gold
upon
the
table
the
next
morning
i
called
for
the
when
we
resumed
quite
eagerly
the
conversation
of
the
preceding
day
while
thus
engaged
however
a
loud
report
as
if
of
a
pistol
was
heard
immediately
beneath
the
windows
of
the
hotel
and
was
succeeded
by
a
series
of
fearful
screams
and
the
shoutings
of
a
mob
d
rushed
to
a
casement
threw
it
open
and
looked
out
in
the
meantime
i
stepped
to
the
took
the
letter
put
it
in
my
pocket
and
replaced
it
by
a
facsimile
so
far
as
regards
externals
which
i
had
carefully
prepared
at
my
lodgings
imitating
the
d
cipher
very
readily
by
means
of
a
seal
formed
of
bread
the
disturbance
in
the
street
had
been
occasioned
by
the
frantic
behavior
of
a
man
with
a
musket
he
had
fired
it
among
a
crowd
of
women
and
children
it
proved
however
to
have
been
without
ball
and
the
fellow
was
suffered
to
go
his
way
as
a
lunatic
or
a
drunkard
when
he
had
gone
d
came
from
the
window
whither
i
had
followed
him
immediately
upon
securing
the
object
in
view
soon
afterwards
i
bade
him
farewell
the
pretended
lunatic
was
a
man
in
my
own
pay
but
what
purpose
had
you
i
asked
in
replacing
the
letter
by
a
facsimile
would
it
not
have
been
better
at
the
first
visit
to
have
seized
it
openly
and
departed
d
replied
dupin
is
a
desperate
man
and
a
man
of
nerve
his
hotel
too
is
not
without
attendants
devoted
to
his
interests
had
i
made
the
wild
attempt
you
suggest
i
might
never
have
left
the
ministerial
presence
alive
the
good
people
of
paris
might
have
heard
of
me
no
more
but
i
had
an
object
apart
from
these
considerations
you
know
my
political
prepossessions
in
this
matter
i
act
as
a
partisan
of
the
lady
concerned
for
eighteen
months
the
minister
has
had
her
in
his
power
she
has
now
him
in
hers
since
being
unaware
that
the
letter
is
not
in
his
possession
he
will
proceed
with
his
exactions
as
if
it
was
thus
will
he
inevitably
commit
himself
at
once
to
his
political
destruction
his
downfall
too
will
not
be
more
precipitate
than
awkward
it
is
all
very
well
to
talk
about
the
descensus
but
in
all
kinds
of
climbing
as
catalani
said
of
singing
it
is
far
more
easy
to
get
up
than
to
come
down
in
the
present
instance
i
have
no
sympathy
at
least
no
pity
for
him
who
descends
he
is
that
an
unprincipled
man
of
genius
i
confess
however
that
i
should
like
very
well
to
know
the
precise
character
of
his
thoughts
when
being
defied
by
her
whom
the
prefect
terms
certain
personage
he
is
reduced
to
opening
the
letter
which
i
left
for
him
in
the
how
did
you
put
anything
particular
in
it
why
it
did
not
seem
altogether
right
to
leave
the
interior
blank
that
would
have
been
insulting
d
at
vienna
once
did
me
an
evil
turn
which
i
told
him
quite
that
i
should
remember
so
as
i
knew
he
would
feel
some
curiosity
in
regard
to
the
identity
of
the
person
who
had
outwitted
him
i
thought
it
a
pity
not
to
give
him
a
clew
he
is
well
acquainted
with
my
and
