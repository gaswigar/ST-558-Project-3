chapter
i
the
kindling
of
love
the
yard
was
all
silent
and
empty
under
the
burning
afternoon
heat
which
had
made
its
asphalt
springy
like
turf
when
suddenly
the
children
threw
themselves
out
of
the
great
doors
at
either
end
of
the
boys
from
the
right
girls
from
the
left
in
two
howling
impetuous
streams
that
widened
eddied
intermingled
and
formed
backwaters
until
the
whole
quadrangle
was
full
of
clamour
and
movement
many
of
the
scholars
carried
bound
in
vivid
tints
and
proudly
exhibited
these
volumes
to
their
companions
and
to
the
teachers
who
tall
languid
and
condescending
soon
began
to
appear
amid
the
restless
throng
near
the
door
a
little
girl
of
twelve
years
dressed
in
a
cream
coloured
frock
with
a
wide
and
heavy
straw
hat
stood
quietly
kicking
her
legs
against
the
wall
she
was
one
of
those
who
had
won
a
prize
and
once
or
twice
she
took
the
treasure
from
under
her
arm
to
glance
at
its
frontispiece
with
a
vague
smile
of
satisfaction
for
a
time
her
bright
eyes
were
fixed
expectantly
on
the
doorway
then
they
would
wander
and
she
started
to
count
the
windows
of
the
various
connexional
buildings
which
on
three
sides
enclosed
the
yard
chapel
school
and
house
most
of
the
children
had
already
squeezed
through
the
narrow
iron
gate
into
the
street
beyond
where
a
was
rumbling
and
clattering
up
duck
bank
attended
by
its
immense
shadow
the
teachers
remained
a
little
behind
gradually
dropping
the
pedagogic
pose
and
happy
in
the
virtuous
sensation
of
duty
accomplished
they
forgot
the
frets
and
fatigues
of
the
day
and
grew
amiably
vivacious
among
themselves
with
an
instinctive
mutual
complacency
the
two
sexes
mixed
again
after
separation
greetings
and
pleasantries
were
exchanged
and
intimate
conversations
begun
and
then
dividing
into
small
familiar
groups
the
young
men
and
women
slowly
followed
their
pupils
out
of
the
gate
the
who
always
had
an
injured
expression
left
the
white
step
of
his
residence
and
walking
with
official
dignity
across
the
yard
drew
down
the
of
the
chapel
one
after
another
as
he
approached
the
little
solitary
girl
in
his
course
he
gave
her
a
reluctant
acid
recognition
then
he
returned
to
his
hearth
agnes
was
alone
young
lady
she
looked
round
with
a
jump
and
blushed
smiling
and
screwing
up
her
little
shoulders
when
she
recognised
the
two
men
who
were
coming
towards
her
from
the
door
of
the
the
one
who
had
called
out
was
henry
mynors
morning
superintendent
of
the
and
conductor
of
the
men
held
in
the
on
sunday
afternoons
the
other
was
william
price
usually
styled
willie
price
secretary
of
the
same
and
son
of
titus
price
the
afternoon
superintendent
sure
you
do
deserve
that
prize
let
me
see
if
it
is
too
good
for
you
mynors
smiled
playfully
down
upon
agnes
tellwright
as
he
idly
turned
the
leaves
of
the
book
which
she
handed
to
him
do
you
deserve
it
tell
me
honestly
she
scrutinised
those
sparkling
and
vehement
black
eyes
with
the
fearless
calm
of
infancy
i
do
she
answered
in
her
high
thin
voice
having
at
length
decided
within
herself
that
mynors
was
joking
i
suppose
you
must
have
it
he
admitted
with
a
fine
air
of
giving
way
as
agnes
took
the
volume
from
him
she
thought
how
perfect
a
man
mynors
was
his
eyes
so
kind
and
sincere
and
that
mysterious
delicious
inexpressible
something
which
dwelt
behind
his
eyes
these
constituted
an
ideal
for
her
willie
price
stood
somewhat
apart
grinning
and
pulling
a
thin
moustache
he
was
at
the
uncouth
disjointed
age
and
nine
years
younger
than
henry
mynors
despite
a
continual
effort
after
ease
of
manner
he
was
often
sheepish
and
even
as
now
when
he
could
discover
no
reason
for
such
a
condition
of
mind
but
agnes
liked
him
too
his
simple
pale
blue
eyes
had
a
wistfulness
which
made
her
feel
towards
him
as
she
felt
towards
her
doll
when
she
happened
to
find
it
lying
neglected
on
the
floor
big
sister
is
out
of
school
yet
mynors
remarked
agnes
shook
her
head
been
waiting
ever
so
long
she
said
plaintively
at
that
moment
a
woman
with
a
benevolent
but
rather
pinched
face
emerged
with
much
briskness
from
the
girls
door
this
was
sutton
a
distant
relative
of
mynors
his
mother
had
been
her
second
cousin
the
men
raised
their
hats
just
been
down
to
make
sure
of
some
of
you
slippery
folks
for
the
she
said
shaking
hands
with
mynors
and
including
both
him
and
willie
price
in
an
embracing
maternal
smile
she
was
and
did
not
perceive
agnes
who
had
fallen
back
a
good
class
this
afternoon
henry
sutton
breathing
was
short
and
quick
yes
he
said
good
indeed
doing
a
grand
work
had
over
seventy
present
he
added
she
said
make
nothing
of
numbers
henry
i
meant
a
class
does
it
say
where
or
are
gathered
together
but
i
must
be
getting
on
the
horse
will
be
restless
i
to
go
up
to
hillport
before
tea
clayton
vernon
is
scarcely
having
stopped
in
her
active
course
sutton
drew
the
men
along
with
her
down
the
yard
she
and
mynors
in
rapid
talk
willie
price
fell
a
little
to
the
rear
his
big
hands
into
his
pockets
and
his
eyes
diffidently
roving
it
appeared
as
though
he
could
not
find
courage
to
take
a
share
in
the
conversation
yet
was
anxious
to
convince
himself
of
his
right
to
do
so
mynors
helped
sutton
into
her
carriage
which
had
been
drawn
up
outside
the
gate
of
the
school
yard
only
two
families
of
the
bursley
wesleyan
methodists
kept
a
carriage
the
suttons
and
the
clayton
vernons
the
latter
boasting
lineage
and
a
large
house
in
the
aristocratic
suburb
of
hillport
gave
to
the
society
monetary
aid
and
a
gracious
condescension
but
though
indubitably
above
the
operation
of
any
unwritten
sumptuary
law
even
the
clayton
vernons
ventured
only
in
wet
weather
to
bring
their
carriage
to
chapel
yet
sutton
who
was
a
plain
woman
might
with
impunity
use
her
equipage
on
sundays
this
license
granted
by
connexional
opinion
was
due
to
the
fact
that
she
so
obviously
regarded
her
carriage
not
as
a
carriage
but
as
a
contrivance
on
four
wheels
for
enabling
an
infirm
creature
to
move
rapidly
from
place
to
place
when
she
got
into
it
she
had
exactly
the
air
of
a
doctor
on
his
rounds
sutton
bodily
frame
had
long
ago
proved
inadequate
to
the
ceaseless
demands
of
a
spirit
indefatigably
altruistic
and
her
continuance
in
activity
was
a
notable
illustration
of
the
dominion
of
mind
over
matter
her
husband
a
potter
valuer
and
commission
agent
made
money
with
facility
in
that
lucrative
vocation
and
his
wife
charities
were
famous
notwithstanding
her
attempts
to
hide
them
neither
husband
nor
wife
had
allowed
riches
to
put
a
factitious
gloss
upon
their
primal
simplicity
they
were
as
they
were
save
that
sutton
had
joined
the
five
towns
field
club
and
acquired
some
of
the
habits
of
an
archaeologist
the
influence
of
wealth
on
manners
was
to
be
observed
only
in
their
daughter
beatrice
who
while
favouring
her
mother
dressed
at
considerable
expense
and
at
intervals
gave
much
time
to
the
arts
of
music
and
painting
agnes
watched
the
carriage
drive
away
and
then
turned
to
look
up
the
stairs
within
the
school
doorway
she
sighed
scowled
and
sighed
again
murmured
something
to
herself
and
finally
began
to
read
her
book
come
out
yet
mynors
was
at
her
side
once
more
alone
this
time
not
yet
said
agnes
wearied
here
she
is
anna
what
ages
you
been
anna
tellwright
stood
motionless
for
a
second
in
the
shadow
of
the
doorway
she
was
tall
but
not
unusually
so
and
sturdily
built
up
her
figure
though
the
bust
was
a
little
flat
had
the
lenient
curves
of
absolute
maturity
anna
had
been
a
woman
since
seventeen
and
she
was
now
on
the
eve
of
her
birthday
she
wore
a
plain
light
frock
checked
with
brown
and
edged
with
brown
velvet
thin
cotton
gloves
of
cream
colour
and
a
broad
straw
hat
like
her
sister
her
grave
face
owing
to
the
prominence
of
the
cheekbones
and
the
width
of
the
jaw
had
a
slight
angularity
the
lips
were
thin
the
brown
eyes
rather
large
the
eyebrows
level
the
nose
fine
and
delicate
the
ears
could
scarcely
be
seen
for
the
dark
brown
hair
which
was
brushed
diagonally
across
the
temples
leaving
of
the
forehead
only
a
pale
triangle
it
seemed
a
face
for
the
cloister
austere
in
contour
fervent
in
expression
the
severity
of
it
mollified
by
that
resigned
and
spiritual
melancholy
peculiar
to
women
who
through
the
error
of
destiny
have
been
born
into
a
wrong
environment
as
if
charmed
forward
by
mynors
compelling
eyes
anna
stepped
into
the
sunlight
at
the
same
time
putting
up
her
parasol
calm
and
stately
she
is
he
thought
as
she
gave
him
her
cool
hand
and
murmured
a
reply
to
his
salutation
but
even
his
aquiline
gaze
could
not
surprise
the
secrets
of
that
concealing
breast
this
was
one
of
the
three
great
tumultuous
moments
of
her
life
she
realised
for
the
first
time
that
she
was
loved
are
late
this
afternoon
miss
tellwright
mynors
began
with
the
easy
inflections
of
a
man
well
accustomed
to
prominence
in
the
society
of
women
little
agnes
seized
anna
left
arm
silently
holding
up
the
prize
and
anna
nodded
appreciation
she
said
as
they
walked
across
the
yard
of
my
girls
has
been
doing
wrong
she
stole
a
bible
from
another
girl
so
of
course
i
had
to
mention
it
to
the
superintendent
price
gave
her
a
long
lecture
and
now
she
is
waiting
upstairs
till
he
is
ready
to
go
with
her
to
her
home
and
talk
to
her
parents
he
says
she
must
be
dismissed
anna
look
flashed
a
grateful
response
to
him
by
the
least
possible
emphasis
he
had
expressed
a
complete
disagreement
with
his
senior
colleague
which
etiquette
forbade
him
to
utter
in
words
think
it
a
very
great
pity
anna
said
firmly
rather
like
the
girl
she
ventured
in
haste
might
speak
to
price
about
it
he
mentions
it
to
me
i
meant
that
price
said
if
it
had
been
anything
else
but
a
he
murmured
very
low
but
she
caught
the
significance
of
his
intonation
they
did
not
glance
at
each
other
it
was
unnecessary
anna
felt
that
comfortable
easement
of
the
spirit
which
springs
from
the
recognition
of
another
spirit
capable
of
understanding
without
explanations
and
of
sympathising
without
a
phrase
under
that
calm
mask
a
strange
and
sweet
satisfaction
thrilled
through
her
as
her
precious
instinct
of
common
sense
rarest
of
good
qualities
and
pining
always
for
fellowship
found
a
companion
in
his
own
she
had
dreaded
the
overtures
which
for
a
fortnight
past
she
had
foreseen
were
inevitably
to
come
from
mynors
he
was
a
stranger
whom
she
merely
respected
now
in
a
sudden
disclosure
she
knew
him
and
liked
him
the
dire
apprehension
of
those
formal
which
she
had
watched
other
men
make
to
other
women
faded
away
it
was
at
once
a
release
and
a
reassurance
they
were
passing
through
the
gate
agnes
skipping
round
her
skirts
when
willie
price
reappeared
front
the
direction
of
the
chapel
something
mynors
inquired
of
him
blandly
he
stammered
clumsily
raising
his
hat
to
anna
she
thought
of
him
exactly
as
agnes
had
done
he
hesitated
for
a
fraction
of
time
and
then
went
up
the
yard
towards
the
has
been
showing
me
her
prize
said
mynors
as
the
three
stood
together
outside
the
gate
ask
her
if
she
thinks
she
really
deserves
it
and
she
says
she
does
what
do
you
think
miss
big
sister
anna
gave
the
little
girl
an
affectionate
smile
of
comprehension
is
it
called
dear
janey
sacrifice
or
the
spool
of
cotton
and
other
stories
for
children
agnes
read
out
in
a
monotone
then
she
clutched
elbow
and
aimed
a
whisper
at
her
ear
well
dear
anna
answered
aloud
we
must
be
back
by
a
four
and
turning
to
mynors
wants
to
go
up
to
the
park
to
hear
the
band
play
going
up
there
too
he
said
along
agnes
take
my
arm
and
show
me
the
way
shyly
agnes
left
her
sister
side
and
put
a
pink
finger
into
mynors
hand
moor
road
which
climbs
over
the
ridge
to
the
mining
village
of
moorthorne
and
passes
the
new
park
on
its
way
was
crowded
with
people
going
up
to
criticise
and
enjoy
this
latest
outcome
of
municipal
enterprise
in
bursley
sedate
elders
of
the
borough
who
smiled
grimly
to
see
one
another
on
sunday
afternoon
in
that
undignified
idly
curious
throng
potters
and
miners
with
the
swarthy
pallor
of
subterranean
toil
untidy
sabbath
loafers
whom
neither
church
nor
chapel
could
entice
and
the
respectable
who
had
not
only
clothes
but
a
separate
deportment
for
the
seventh
day
whose
pale
faces
as
of
prisoners
free
only
for
a
while
showed
a
naïve
and
timorous
pleasure
in
the
unusual
diversion
young
women
made
glorious
by
stuffs
and
carrying
themselves
with
the
defiant
independence
of
good
wages
earned
in
warehouse
or
youths
oppressed
by
stiff
new
clothes
bought
at
whitsuntide
in
which
the
bright
necktie
and
the
nosegay
revealed
a
thousand
secret
aspirations
young
children
running
and
yelling
with
the
marvellous
energy
of
their
years
here
and
there
a
small
group
whose
studious
repudiation
of
the
crowd
betrayed
a
conscious
eminence
of
rank
louts
drunkards
idiots
beggars
waifs
outcasts
and
every
oddity
of
the
town
all
were
more
or
less
under
the
influence
of
a
new
excitement
and
all
with
the
same
face
of
pleased
expectancy
looked
towards
the
spot
where
up
the
hill
a
denser
mass
of
sightseers
indicated
the
grand
entrance
to
the
park
stacks
of
folks
agnes
exclaimed
like
going
to
a
football
match
you
go
to
football
matches
agnes
mynors
asked
the
child
gave
a
giggle
anna
was
relieved
when
these
two
began
to
chatter
she
had
at
once
by
a
firm
natural
impulse
subdued
the
agitation
which
seized
her
when
she
found
mynors
waiting
with
such
an
obvious
intention
at
the
school
door
she
had
conversed
with
him
in
tones
of
quiet
ease
his
attitude
had
even
enabled
her
in
a
few
moments
to
establish
a
pleasant
familiarity
with
him
nevertheless
as
they
joined
the
stream
of
people
in
moor
road
she
longed
to
be
at
home
in
her
kitchen
in
order
to
examine
herself
and
the
new
situation
thus
created
by
mynors
and
yet
also
she
was
glad
that
she
must
remain
at
his
side
but
it
was
a
fluttered
joy
that
his
presence
gave
her
too
strange
for
immediate
appreciation
as
her
eye
without
directly
looking
at
him
embraced
the
suave
and
admirable
male
creature
within
its
field
of
vision
she
became
aware
that
he
was
quite
inscrutable
to
her
what
were
his
inmost
thoughts
his
ideals
the
histories
of
his
heart
surely
it
was
impossible
that
she
should
ever
know
these
secrets
he
and
she
they
were
utterly
foreign
to
each
other
so
the
primary
dissonances
of
sex
vibrated
within
her
and
her
own
feelings
puzzled
her
still
there
was
an
instant
pleasure
delightful
if
disturbing
and
inexplicable
and
also
there
was
a
sensation
of
triumph
which
though
she
tried
to
scorn
it
she
could
not
banish
that
a
man
and
a
woman
should
saunter
together
on
that
road
was
nothing
but
the
circumstance
acquired
tremendous
importance
when
the
man
happened
to
be
henry
mynors
and
the
woman
anna
tellwright
mynors
handsome
dark
accomplished
exemplary
and
prosperous
had
walked
for
ten
years
circumspect
and
unscathed
amid
the
glances
of
a
whole
legion
of
maids
as
for
anna
the
peculiarity
of
her
position
had
always
marked
her
for
special
attention
ever
since
her
father
settled
in
bursley
she
had
felt
herself
to
be
the
object
of
an
interest
in
which
awe
and
pity
were
equally
mingled
she
guessed
that
the
fact
of
her
going
to
the
park
with
mynors
that
afternoon
would
pass
swiftly
from
mouth
to
mouth
like
the
rumour
of
a
decisive
event
she
had
no
friends
her
innate
reserve
had
been
misinterpreted
and
she
was
not
popular
among
the
wesleyan
community
many
people
would
say
and
more
would
think
that
it
was
her
money
which
was
drawing
mynors
from
the
narrow
path
of
his
celibate
discretion
she
could
imagine
all
the
innuendoes
the
expressive
nods
the
pursing
of
lips
the
lifting
of
shoulders
and
of
eyebrows
do
owt
that
was
the
proverb
but
she
cared
not
she
had
the
just
and
unshakable
which
is
fundamental
in
all
strong
and
righteous
natures
and
she
knew
beyond
the
possibility
of
doubt
that
though
mynors
might
have
no
incurable
aversion
to
a
fortune
she
herself
the
spirit
and
body
of
her
had
been
the
sole
awakener
of
his
desire
by
a
common
instinct
mynors
and
anna
made
little
agnes
the
centre
of
attraction
mynors
continued
to
tease
her
and
agnes
growing
courageous
began
to
retort
she
was
now
walking
between
them
and
the
other
two
smiled
to
each
other
at
the
child
sayings
over
her
head
interchanging
thus
messages
too
subtle
and
delicate
for
the
coarse
medium
of
words
as
they
approached
the
park
the
bandstand
came
into
sight
over
the
railway
cutting
and
they
could
hear
the
music
of
emperor
hymn
the
crude
brazen
sounds
were
tempered
in
their
passage
through
the
warm
still
air
and
fell
gently
on
the
ear
in
soft
waves
quickening
every
heart
to
unaccustomed
emotions
children
leaped
forward
and
old
people
unconsciously
assumed
a
lightsome
vigour
the
park
rose
in
terraces
from
the
railway
station
to
a
street
of
small
villas
almost
on
the
ridge
of
the
hill
from
its
gilded
gates
to
its
smallest
it
was
and
most
of
it
was
red
the
house
the
bandstand
the
kiosks
the
balustrades
the
shelters
all
these
assailed
the
eye
with
a
uniform
redness
of
brick
and
tile
which
nullified
the
pallid
greens
of
the
turf
and
the
frail
trees
the
immense
crowd
in
order
to
circulate
moved
along
in
tight
processions
inspecting
one
after
another
the
various
features
of
which
they
had
read
full
descriptions
in
the
signal
waterfall
grotto
lake
swans
boat
seats
faïence
statues
and
scanning
with
interest
the
names
of
the
donors
so
clearly
inscribed
on
such
objects
of
art
and
craft
as
from
divers
motives
had
been
presented
to
the
town
by
its
citizens
mynors
as
he
manoeuvred
a
way
for
the
two
girls
through
the
main
avenue
up
to
the
topmost
terrace
gravely
judged
each
thing
upon
its
merits
approving
this
condemning
that
in
deciding
that
under
all
the
circumstances
the
park
made
a
very
creditable
appearance
he
only
reflected
the
best
local
opinion
the
town
was
proud
of
its
achievement
and
it
had
the
right
to
be
for
though
this
narrow
pleasaunce
was
in
itself
unlovely
it
symbolised
the
first
faint
renascence
of
the
longing
for
beauty
in
a
district
long
given
up
to
unredeemed
ugliness
at
length
mynors
having
encountered
many
acquaintances
they
got
past
the
bandstand
and
stood
on
the
highest
terrace
which
was
almost
deserted
beneath
them
in
front
stretched
a
maze
of
roofs
dominated
by
the
gold
angel
of
the
town
hall
spire
bursley
the
ancient
home
of
the
potter
has
an
antiquity
of
a
thousand
years
it
lies
towards
the
north
end
of
an
extensive
valley
which
must
have
been
one
of
the
fairest
spots
in
alfred
england
but
which
is
now
defaced
by
the
activities
of
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
people
five
contiguous
towns
turnhill
bursley
hanbridge
knype
and
longshaw
united
by
a
single
winding
thoroughfare
some
eight
miles
in
length
have
inundated
the
valley
like
a
succession
of
great
lakes
of
these
five
bursley
is
the
mother
but
hanbridge
is
the
largest
they
are
mean
and
forbidding
of
aspect
sombre
uncouth
and
the
vaporous
poison
of
their
ovens
and
chimneys
has
soiled
and
shrivelled
the
surrounding
country
till
there
is
no
village
lane
within
a
league
but
what
offers
a
gaunt
and
ludicrous
travesty
of
rural
charms
nothing
could
be
more
prosaic
than
the
huddled
streets
nothing
more
seemingly
remote
from
romance
yet
be
it
said
that
romance
is
even
here
the
romance
which
for
those
who
have
an
eye
to
perceive
it
ever
dwells
amid
the
seats
of
industrial
manufacture
softening
the
coarseness
transfiguring
the
squalor
of
these
mighty
alchemic
operations
look
down
into
the
valley
from
this
where
love
is
kindling
embrace
the
whole
amphitheatre
in
a
glance
and
it
may
be
that
you
will
suddenly
comprehend
the
secret
and
superb
significance
of
the
vast
doing
which
goes
forward
below
because
they
seldom
think
the
townsmen
take
shame
when
indicted
for
having
disfigured
half
a
county
in
order
to
live
they
have
not
understood
that
this
disfigurement
is
merely
an
episode
in
the
unending
warfare
of
man
and
nature
and
calls
for
no
contrition
here
indeed
is
nature
repaid
for
some
of
her
notorious
cruelties
she
imperiously
bids
man
sustain
and
reproduce
himself
and
this
is
one
of
the
places
where
in
the
very
act
of
obedience
he
wounds
and
maltreats
her
out
beyond
the
municipal
confines
where
the
subsidiary
industries
of
coal
and
iron
prosper
amid
a
wreck
of
verdure
the
struggle
is
grim
appalling
heroic
so
ruthless
is
his
havoc
of
her
so
indomitable
her
ceaseless
recuperation
on
the
one
side
is
a
wresting
from
nature
own
bowels
of
the
means
to
waste
her
on
the
other
an
undismayed
enduring
fortitude
the
grass
grows
though
it
is
not
green
it
grows
in
the
very
heart
of
the
valley
hedged
about
with
furnaces
a
farm
still
stands
and
at
the
sooty
sheaves
are
gathered
in
the
band
stopped
playing
a
whole
population
was
idle
in
the
park
and
it
seemed
in
the
fierce
calm
of
the
sunlight
that
of
all
the
strenuous
weekday
vitality
of
the
district
only
a
murmurous
hush
remained
but
everywhere
on
the
horizon
and
nearer
furnaces
cast
their
heavy
smoke
across
the
borders
of
the
sky
the
doing
was
never
suspended
mynors
said
agnes
still
holding
his
hand
when
they
had
been
silent
a
moment
do
those
furnaces
go
out
do
go
out
he
answered
there
is
a
strike
it
costs
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
pounds
to
light
them
again
it
she
said
vaguely
says
it
the
smoke
that
stops
my
gilliflowers
from
growing
mynors
turned
to
anna
father
seems
the
picture
of
health
i
saw
him
out
this
morning
at
a
quarter
to
seven
as
brisk
as
a
boy
what
a
constitution
anna
replied
is
always
up
at
six
you
are
i
suppose
i
too
me
too
agnes
interjected
how
does
bursley
compare
with
hanbridge
mynors
continued
anna
paused
before
replying
like
it
better
she
said
first
last
year
i
thought
i
should
the
way
your
father
used
to
preach
in
hanbridge
circuit
was
years
ago
she
said
quickly
why
wo
he
preach
here
i
dare
say
you
know
that
we
are
rather
short
of
local
preachers
good
ones
that
is
ca
say
why
father
does
preach
now
anna
flushed
as
she
spoke
had
better
ask
him
that
i
will
do
he
laughed
am
coming
to
see
him
soon
perhaps
one
night
next
week
anna
looked
at
henry
mynors
as
he
uttered
the
astonishing
words
the
tellwrights
had
been
in
bursley
a
year
but
no
visitor
had
crossed
their
doorsteps
except
the
minister
once
and
such
poor
defaulters
as
came
full
of
excuse
and
obsequious
conciliation
to
pay
rent
overdue
i
suppose
she
said
and
prayed
that
he
might
not
be
intending
to
make
a
mere
call
of
ceremony
business
he
answered
lightly
you
will
be
in
am
always
in
she
said
she
wondered
what
the
business
could
be
and
felt
relieved
to
know
that
his
visit
would
have
at
least
some
assigned
pretext
but
already
her
heart
beat
with
apprehensive
perturbation
at
the
thought
of
his
presence
in
their
household
said
agnes
whose
eyes
were
everywhere
miss
sutton
both
mynors
and
anna
looked
sharply
round
beatrice
sutton
was
coming
towards
them
along
the
terrace
stylishly
clad
in
a
dress
of
pink
muslin
with
harmonious
hat
gloves
and
sunshade
she
made
an
agreeable
and
rather
effective
picture
despite
her
plain
round
face
and
stoutish
figure
she
had
the
air
of
being
a
leader
grafted
on
to
the
original
simple
honesty
of
her
eyes
there
was
the
arrogance
of
one
who
had
always
been
accustomed
to
deference
socially
beatrice
had
no
peer
among
the
young
women
who
were
active
in
the
wesleyan
beatrice
had
been
used
to
teach
in
the
afternoon
school
but
she
had
recently
advanced
her
labours
from
the
afternoon
to
the
morning
in
response
to
a
hint
that
if
she
did
so
the
force
of
her
influence
and
example
might
lessen
the
chronic
dearth
of
morning
teachers
afternoon
miss
tellwright
beatrice
said
as
she
came
up
you
have
come
to
look
at
the
park
said
anna
and
then
stopped
awkwardly
in
the
tone
of
each
there
was
an
obscure
constraint
and
something
in
mynors
smile
of
salute
to
beatrice
showed
that
he
too
shared
it
you
before
beatrice
said
to
him
familiarly
without
taking
his
hand
then
she
bent
down
and
kissed
agnes
are
you
doing
here
mademoiselle
mynors
asked
her
just
down
below
near
the
lake
he
caught
sight
of
you
and
sent
me
up
to
say
that
you
were
to
be
sure
to
come
in
to
supper
you
will
wo
you
thanks
i
had
meant
to
anna
knew
that
they
were
related
and
also
that
mynors
was
constantly
at
the
suttons
house
but
the
close
intimacy
between
these
two
came
nevertheless
like
a
shock
to
her
she
could
not
conquer
a
certain
resentment
of
it
however
absurd
such
a
feeling
might
seem
to
her
intelligence
and
this
attitude
extended
not
only
to
the
intimacy
but
to
beatrice
handsome
clothes
and
facile
urbanity
which
by
contrast
emphasised
her
own
poor
little
frock
and
manner
the
mere
existence
of
beatrice
so
near
to
mynors
was
like
an
affront
to
her
yet
at
heart
and
even
while
admiring
this
shining
daughter
of
success
she
was
conscious
within
herself
of
a
fundamental
superiority
the
soul
of
her
condescended
to
the
soul
of
the
other
one
they
began
to
discuss
the
park
says
it
will
send
up
the
value
of
that
land
over
there
enormously
said
beatrice
pointing
with
her
ribboned
sunshade
to
some
building
plots
which
lay
to
the
north
high
up
the
hill
tellwright
owns
most
of
that
does
he
she
added
to
anna
dare
say
he
does
said
anna
it
was
torture
to
her
to
refer
to
her
father
possessions
course
it
will
be
covered
with
streets
in
a
few
months
will
he
build
himself
or
will
he
sell
it
have
the
least
idea
anna
answered
with
an
effort
after
gaiety
of
tone
and
then
turned
aside
to
look
at
the
crowd
there
close
against
the
bandstand
stood
her
father
a
short
stout
ruddy
man
in
a
shabby
brown
suit
he
recognised
her
stared
fixedly
and
nodded
with
his
grotesque
and
ambiguous
grin
then
he
sidled
off
towards
the
entrance
of
the
park
none
of
the
others
had
seen
him
dear
she
said
abruptly
must
go
now
or
we
shall
be
late
for
tea
as
the
two
women
said
their
eyes
met
and
in
the
brief
second
of
that
encounter
each
tried
to
wring
from
the
other
the
true
answer
to
a
question
which
lay
unuttered
in
her
heart
then
having
bidden
adieu
to
mynors
whose
parting
glance
sang
its
own
song
to
her
anna
took
agnes
by
the
hand
and
left
him
and
beatrice
together
chapter

the

daughter
anna
sat
in
the
of
the
front
parlour
her
accustomed
place
on
sunday
evenings
in

and
watched
tellwright
and
agnes
disappear
down
the
slope
of
trafalgar
road
on
their
way
to
chapel
trafalgar
road
is
the
long
thoroughfare
which
under
many
aliases
runs
through
the
five
towns
from
end
to
end
uniting
them
as
a
river
might
unite
them
ephraim
tellwright
could
remember
the
time
when
this
part
of
it
was
a
country
lane
flanked
by
meadows
and
market
gardens
now
it
was
a
street
of
houses
up
to
and
beyond
bleakridge
where
the
tellwrights
lived
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
the
houses
came
only
in
patches
until
the
borders
of
hanbridge
were
reached
within
the
municipal
limits
bleakridge
was
the
pleasantest
quarter
of
bursley
hillport
abode
of
the
highest
fashion
had
its
own
government
and
authority
and
to
reside
the
top
of
trafalgar
road
was
still
the
final
ambition
of
many
citizens
though
the
natural
growth
of
the
town
had
robbed
bleakridge
of
some
of
that
exclusive
distinction
which
it
once
possessed
trafalgar
road
in
its
journey
to
bleakridge
from
the
centre
of
the
town
underwent
certain
changes
of
character
first
came
a
succession
of
manufactories
and
small
shops
then
at
the
beginning
of
the
rise
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
superior
cottages
and
lastly
on
the
brow
occurred
the
houses
of
the
and
in
terraces
with
rentals
from
to
a
year
the
tellwrights
lived
in
manor
terrace
the
name
being
a
last
reminder
of
the
great
farmstead
which
formerly
occupied
the
western
hill
side
their
house
of
light
yellow
brick
was
with
a
long
narrow
garden
behind
and
the
rent
exactly
opposite
was
an
antique
red
mansion
standing
back
in
its
own
ground
home
of
the
mynors
family
for
two
generations
but
now
a
school
the
mynors
family
being
extinct
in
the
district
save
for
one
member
somewhat
higher
up
still
on
the
opposite
side
to
manor
terrace
came
an
imposing
row
of
four
new
houses
said
to
be
the
best
planned
and
best
built
in
the
town
each
erected
separately
and
occupied
by
its
owner
the
nearest
of
these
four
was
councillor
sutton
valued
at
a
year
lower
down
below
manor
terrace
and
on
the
same
side
lived
the
wesleyan
superintendent
minister
the
vicar
of
luke
church
an
alderman
and
a
doctor
it
was
nearly
six
the
sun
shone
but
gentlier
and
the
earth
lay
cooling
in
the
mild
pensive
effulgence
of
a
summer
evening
even
the
onrush
of
the
as
it
swept
with
a
gay
load
of
passengers
to
hanbridge
seemed
to
be
chastened
the
bell
of
the
roman
catholic
chapel
sounded
like
the
bell
of
some
village
church
heard
in
the
distance
the
quick
but
sober
tramp
of
the
fell
peacefully
on
the
ear
the
sense
of
calm
increased
and
steeped
in
this
meditative
calm
anna
from
the
open
window
gazed
idly
down
the
perspective
of
the
road
which
ended
a
mile
away
in
the
dim
concave
forms
of
ovens
suffused
in
a
pale
mist
a
book
from
the
free
library
lay
on
her
lap
she
could
not
read
it
she
was
conscious
of
nothing
save
the
quiet
enchantment
of
reverie
her
mind
stimulated
by
the
emotions
of
the
afternoon
broke
the
fetters
of
habitual
and
ranged
voluptuously
free
over
the
whole
field
of
recollection
and
anticipation
to
remember
to
hope
that
was
sufficient
joy
in
the
dissolving
views
of
her
own
past
from
which
the
rigour
and
pain
seemed
to
have
mysteriously
departed
the
chief
figure
was
always
her
father
that
sinister
and
formidable
individuality

her
mind
hated
but

disobediently

ephraim
tellwright
was
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
and
most
mysterious
men
in
the
five
towns
the
outer
facts
of
his
career
were
known
to
all
for
his
riches
made
him
notorious
but
of
the
secret
and
intimate
man
none
knew
anything
except
anna
and
what
little
anna
knew
had
come
to
her
by
divination
rather
than
discernment
a
native
of
hanbridge
he
had
inherited
a
small
fortune
from
his
father
who
was
a
prominent
wesleyan
methodist
at
thirty
owing
mainly
to
investments
in
property
which
his
calling
of
potter
valuer
had
helped
him
to
choose
with
advantage
he
was
worth
twenty
thousand
pounds
and
he
lived
in
lodgings
on
a
total
expenditure
of
about
a
hundred
a
year
when
he
was
he
suddenly
married
without
any
perceptible
public
wooing
the
daughter
of
a
wood
merchant
at
oldcastle
and
shortly
after
the
marriage
his
wife
inherited
from
her
father
a
sum
of
eighteen
thousand
pounds
the
pair
lived
narrowly
in
a
small
house
up
at
pireford
between
hanbridge
and
oldcastle
they
visited
no
one
and
were
never
seen
together
except
on
sundays
she
was
a
very
unassuming
and
simple
woman
who
smiled
easily
and
talked
with
difficulty
and
for
the
rest
lived
apparently
a
servile
life
of
satisfaction
and
content
after
five
years
anna
was
born
and
in
another
five
years
tellwright
died
of
erysipelas
the
widower
engaged
a
housekeeper
otherwise
his
existence
proceeded
without
change
no
stranger
visited
the
house
the
housekeeper
never
gossiped
but
tales
will
spread
and
people
fell
into
the
habit
of
regarding
tellwright
child
and
his
housekeeper
with
commiseration
during
all
this
period
he
was
what
is
termed
good
wesleyan
preaching
and
teaching
and
spending
himself
in
the
various
activities
of
hanbridge
chapel
for
many
years
he
had
been
circuit
treasurer
among
anna
earliest
memories
was
a
picture
of
her
father
arriving
late
for
supper
one
sunday
night
in
autumn
after
an
anniversary
service
and
pouring
out
on
the
white
tablecloth
the
contents
of
numerous
she
recalled
the
surprising
dexterity
with
which
he
counted
the
coins
the
peculiar
smell
of
the
bags
and
her
mother
bland
exclamation
ephraim
tellwright
belonged
by
birth
to
the
old
guard
of
methodism
there
was
in
his
family
a
tradition
of
holy
valour
for
the
pure
doctrine
his
father
a
bursley
man
had
fought
in
the
fight
which
preceded
the
famous
primitive
methodist
secession
of
at
bursley
and
had
also
borne
a
notable
part
in
the
warren
affrays
of
and
the
disastrous
trouble
of
the
in
when
methodism
lost
a
hundred
thousand
members
as
for
ephraim
he
expounded
the
mystery
of
the
atonement
in
village
conventicles
and
grew
garrulous
with
god
at
in
the
big
bethesda
chapel
but
he
did
these
things
as
routine
without
skill
and
without
enthusiasm
because
they
gave
him
an
unassailable
position
within
the
central
group
of
the
society
he
was
not
in
fact
much
smitten
with
either
the
doctrinal
or
the
spiritual
side
of
methodism
his
chief
interest
lay
in
those
fiscal
schemes
of
organisation
without
whose
aid
no
religious
propaganda
can
possibly
succeed
it
was
in
the
finance
of
salvation
that
he
rose
supreme
the
interminable
alternation
of
and
new
liability
which
provides
a
lasting
excitement
for
nonconformists
in
the
negotiation
of
mortgages
the
artful
arrangement
of
appeals
the
planning
of
anniversaries
and
of
mighty
revivals
he
was
an
undisputed
leader
to
him
the
circuit
was
a
concern
and
he
kept
it
in
motion
serving
the
lord
in
committee
and
over
statements
of
account
the
minister
by
his
pleading
might
bring
sinners
to
the
penitent
form
but
it
was
ephraim
tellwright
who
reduced
the
cost
per
head
of
souls
saved
and
so
widened
the
frontiers
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
three
years
after
the
death
of
his
first
wife
it
was
rumoured
that
he
would
marry
again
and
that
his
choice
had
fallen
on
a
young
orphan
girl
thirty
years
his
junior
who
at
the
stationer
shop
where
he
bought
his
daily
newspaper
the
rumour
was
anna
then
eight
years
of
age
vividly
remembered
the
of
the
pale
wife
and
her
own
sturdy
attempts
to
explain
excuse
or
assuage
to
this
wistful
and
fragile
creature
the
implacable
harshness
of
her
father
temper
agnes
was
born
within
a
year
and
the
pale
girl
died
of
puerperal
fever
in
that
year
lay
a
whole
tragedy
which
could
not
have
been
more
poignant
in
its
perfection
if
the
year
had
been
a
thousand
years
ephraim
promptly
the
old
housekeeper
a
course
which
filled
anna
with
secret
childish
revolt
for
anna
was
now
nine
and
accomplished
in
all
domesticity
in
another
seven
years
the
housekeeper
died
a
gaunt
grey
ruin
and
anna
at
sixteen
became
mistress
of
the
household
with
a
small
sister
to
cherish
and
control
about
this
time
anna
began
to
perceive
that
her
father
was
generally
regarded
as
a
man
of
great
wealth
having
few
rivals
in
the
entire
region
of
the
five
towns
definite
knowledge
however
she
had
none
he
never
spoke
of
his
affairs
she
knew
only
that
he
possessed
houses
and
other
property
in
various
places
that
he
always
turned
first
to
the
money
article
in
the
newspaper
and
that
long
envelopes
arrived
for
him
by
post
almost
daily
but
she
had
once
heard
the
surmise
that
he
was
worth
sixty
thousand
of
his
own
apart
from
the
fortune
of
his
first
wife
anna
mother
nevertheless
it
did
not
occur
to
her
to
think
of
her
father
in
plain
terms
as
a
miser
until
one
day
she
happened
to
read
in
the
some
particulars
of
the
last
will
and
testament
of
william
wilbraham
who
had
just
died
wilbraham
had
been
a
famous
magnate
and
benefactor
of
the
five
towns
his
revered
name
was
in
every
mouth
he
had
a
fine
seat
hillport
house
at
hillport
and
his
superb
horses
were
constantly
seen
winged
and
nervous
in
the
streets
of
bursley
and
hanbridge
the
said
that
the
net
value
of
his
estate
was
sworn
at
thousand
pounds
this
single
fact
added
a
definite
and
startling
significance
to
figures
which
had
previously
conveyed
nothing
to
anna
except
an
idea
of
vastness
the
crude
contrast
between
the
things
of
hillport
house
and
the
things
of
the
abode
in
manor
terrace
gave
food
for
reflection
silent
but
profound
tellwright
had
long
ago
retired
from
business
and
three
years
after
the
housekeeper
died
he
retired
practically
from
religious
work
to
the
grave
detriment
of
the
hanbridge
circuit
in
reply
to
sorrowful
questioners
he
said
merely
that
he
was
getting
old
and
needed
rest
and
that
there
ought
to
be
plenty
of
younger
men
to
fill
his
shoes
he
gave
up
everything
except
his
pew
in
the
chapel
the
circuit
was
astounded
by
this
sudden
defection
of
a
a
local
preacher
and
an
officer
it
was
an
inexplicable
fall
from
grace
yet
the
solution
of
the
problem
was
quite
simple
ephraim
had
lost
interest
in
his
religious
avocations
they
had
ceased
to
amuse
him
the
old
ardour
had
cooled
the
phenomenon
is
a
common
enough
experience
with
men
who
have
passed
their
fiftieth
year
men
too
who
began
with
the
true
and
sacred
zeal
which
tellwright
never
felt
the
difference
in
tellwright
case
was
that
characteristically
he
at
once
yielded
to
the
new
instinct
caring
naught
for
public
opinion
soon
afterwards
having
purchased
a
lot
of
cottage
property
in
bursley
he
decided
to
migrate
to
the
town
of
his
fathers
he
had
more
than
one
reason
for
doing
so
but
perhaps
the
chief
was
that
he
found
the
atmosphere
of
hanbridge
wesleyan
chapel
rather
uncongenial
the
exodus
from
it
was
his
silent
and
malicious
retort
to
a
silent
rebuke
he
appeared
now
to
grow
younger
discarding
in
some
measure
a
certain
morose
taciturnity
which
had
hitherto
marked
his
demeanour
he
went
amiably
about
in
the
manner
of
a
veteran
determined
to
enjoy
the
brief
existence
of
life
winter
his
stout
stiff
deliberate
yet
alert
figure
became
a
familiar
object
to
bursley
that
ruddy
face
with
its
small
blue
eyes
smooth
upper
lip
and
short
grey
beard
under
the
smooth
chin
seemed
to
pervade
the
streets
offering
everywhere
the
conundrum
of
its
vague
smile
though
no
friend
ever
crossed
his
doorstep
he
had
dozens
of
acquaintances
of
the
footpath
he
was
not
however
a
facile
talker
and
he
seldom
gave
an
opinion
nor
were
his
remarks
often
noticeably
shrewd
he
existed
within
himself
unrevealed
to
the
crowd
of
course
he
was
a
marvellous
legend
and
moving
always
in
the
glory
of
that
legend
he
received
their
wondering
awe
an
awe
tinged
with
contempt
for
his
lack
of
ostentation
and
public
splendour
commercial
men
with
whom
he
had
transacted
business
liked
to
discuss
his
abilities
thus
disseminating
that
solid
respect
for
him
which
had
sprung
from
a
personal
experience
of
those
abilities
and
which
not
even
the
shabbiness
of
his
clothes
could
weaken
anna
was
disturbed
by
the
arrival
at
the
front
door
of
the

with
her
father

stayed
at
home
on
sunday
evenings
partly
to
receive
the
evening
milk
and
partly
to
guard
the
house
the
persian
cat
with
one
ear
preceded
her
to
the
door
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
clatter
of
the
can

stout
little

pint
of
milk
into
anna

and
spilt
an
eleemosynary

miss
said
the
smiling
at
the
greedy
cat
and
then
with
a
evenin
departed
down
the
street
one
fat
red
arm
stretched
horizontally
out
to
balance
the
weight
of
the
can
in
the
other
anna
leaned
idly
against
the
doorpost
waiting
while
the
cat
finished
until
at
length
the
swaying
figure
of
the
disappeared
in
the
dip
of
the
road
suddenly
she
darted
within
shutting
the
door
and
stood
on
the
in
a
startled
attitude
of
dismay
she
had
caught
sight
of
henry
mynors
in
the
distance
approaching
the
house
at
that
moment
the
kitchen
clock
struck
seven
and
mynors
according
to
the
rule
of
a
lifetime
should
have
been
in
his
place
in
the
or
as
some
term
it
the
of
the
chapel
where
he
was
an
admired
baritone
anna
dared
not
conjecture
what
impulse
had
led
him
into
this
extraordinary
incredible
deviation
she
dared
not
conjecture
but
despite
herself
she
knew
and
the
knowledge
shocked
her
sensitive
and
peremptory
conscience
her
heart
began
to
beat
rapidly
she
was
in
distress
aware
that
her
father
and
sister
had
left
her
alone
did
he
mean
to
call
it
was
absolutely
impossible
yet
she
feared
it
and
blushed
all
solitary
there
in
the
passage
for
shame
now
she
heard
his
sharp
decided
footsteps
and
through
the
glazed
panels
of
the
door
she
could
see
the
outline
of
his
form
he
stopped
his
hand
was
on
the
gate
and
she
ceased
to
breathe
he
pushed
the
gate
open
and
then
at
the
whisper
of
some
blessed
angel
he
closed
it
again
and
continued
his
way
up
the
street
after
a
few
moments
anna
carried
the
milk
into
the
kitchen
and
stood
by
the
dresser
moveless
each
muscle
braced
in
the
intensity
of
profound
contemplation
gradually
the
tears
rose
to
her
eyes
and
fell
they
were
the
tincture
of
a
strange
and
mystic
joy
too
poignant
to
be
endured
as
it
were
under
compulsion
she
ran
outside
and
down
the
garden
path
to
the
low
wall
which
looked
over
the
grey
fields
of
the
valley
up
to
hillport
exactly
opposite
a
mile
and
a
half
away
on
the
ridge
was
hillport
church
dark
and
clear
against
the
orange
sky
to
the
right
and
nearer
lay
the
central
masses
of
the
town
tier
on
tier
of
ovens
and
chimneys
along
the
couples
moved
slowly
all
was
quiescent
languorous
beautiful
in
the
glow
of
the
sun
stately
declension
anna
put
her
arms
on
the
wall
far
more
impressively
than
in
the
afternoon
she
realised
that
this
was
the
end
of
one
epoch
in
her
career
and
the
beginning
of
another
enthralled
by
austere
traditions
and
that
stern
conscience
of
hers
she
had
never
permitted
herself
to
dream
of
the
possibility
of
an
escape
from
the
parental
servitude
she
had
never
looked
beyond
the
horizons
of
her
present
world
but
had
sought
spiritual
satisfaction
in
the
ideas
of
duty
and
sacrifice
the
worst
tyrannies
of
her
father
never
dulled
the
sense
of
her
duty
to
him
and
without
perhaps
being
aware
of
it
she
had
rather
despised
love
and
the
dalliance
of
the
sexes
in
her
attitude
towards
such
things
there
had
been
not
only
a
little
contempt
but
also
some
disapproval
as
though
man
were
destined
for
higher
ends
now
she
saw
in
a
quick
revelation
that
it
was
the
lovers
and
not
she
who
had
the
right
to
scorn
she
saw
how
miserably
narrow
tepid
and
trickling
the
stream
of
her
life
had
been
and
had
threatened
to
be
now
it
gushed
forth
warm
impetuous
and
full
opening
out
new
and
delicious
vistas
she
lived
and
she
was
finding
the
sight
to
see
the
courage
to
enjoy
now
as
she
leaned
over
the
wall
she
would
not
have
cared
if
henry
mynors
indeed
had
called
that
night
she
perceived
something
splendid
and
free
in
his
abandonment
of
habit
and
discretion
at
the
bidding
of
a
desire
to
be
the
magnet
which
could
draw
that
pattern
and
exemplar
of
seemliness
from
the
strict
orbit
of
virtuous
custom
it
was
she
the
miser
shabby
daughter
who
had
caused
this
amazing
phenomenon
the
thought
intoxicated
her
without
the
support
of
the
wall
she
might
have
fallen
in
a
sort
of
trance
she
murmured
these
words
loves

this
was

tellwright
the
ascetic
the
prosaic
the
impassive
after
an
interval
which
to
her
was
as
much
like
a
minute
as
a
century
she
went
back
into
the
house
as
she
entered
by
the
kitchen
she
heard
an
impatient
knocking
at
the
front
door
last
said
her
father
grimly
when
she
opened
the
door
in
two
words
he
had
resumed
his
terrible
sway
over
her
agnes
looked
timidly
from
one
to
the
other
and
slipped
past
them
into
the
house

in
the
garden
anna
explained
you
been
here
long
she
tried
to
smile
apologetically
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
answered
with
a
grimness
still
more
portentous
wo
speak
again
she
thought
fearfully
but
she
was
mistaken
after
he
had
carefully
hung
his
best
hat
on
the
he
turned
towards
her
and
said
with
a
queer
smile
been
eh
sis
was
her
pet
name
used
often
by
agnes
but
by
her
father
only
at
the
very
rarest
intervals
she
was
staggered
at
this
change
of
front
so
unaccountable
in
this
man
who
when
she
had
unwittingly
annoyed
him
was
capable
of
keeping
an
awful
silence
for
days
together
what
did
he
know
what
had
those
old
eyes
seen
forgot
she
stammered
gathering
herself
together
happily
forgot
the
time
she
felt
that
after
all
there
was
a
bond
between
them
which
nothing
could
break
the
tie
of
blood
they
were
father
and
daughter
united
by
sympathies
obscure
but
fundamental
kissing
was
not
in
the
tellwright
blood
but
she
had
a
fleeting
wish
to
hug
the
tyrant
tellwright
a
name
specially
characteristic
of
and
possibly
originating
in
this
district

the
birthday
the
next
morning
there
was
no
outward
sign
that
anything
unusual
had
occurred
as
the
clock
in
the
kitchen
struck
eight
anna
carried
to
the
back
parlour
a
tray
on
which
were
a
dish
of
bacon
and
a
breakfast
was
already
laid
for
three
she
threw
a
housekeeper
glance
over
the
table
and
called
tellwright
was
some
encaustic
tiles
in
the
lobby
he
came
in
coatless
and
dropping
a
trowel
on
the
hearth
sat
down
at
the
end
of
the
table
nearest
the
fireplace
anna
sat
opposite
to
him
and
poured
out
the
coffee
on
the
dish
were
six
pieces
of
bacon
he
put
one
piece
on
a
plate
and
set
it
carefully
in
front
of
agnes
vacant
chair

he
passed
to
anna

kept
for
himself
agnes
he
inquired

of
the

an
unaccustomed
small
jug

said
and
then
added
my
birthday
he
exclaimed
with
a
trace
of
satire
in
his
voice
a
woman
now
lass
no
further
remark
on
that
matter
was
made
during
the
meal
agnes
ran
in
all
pinafore
and
legs
with
a
toss
backwards
of
her
light
golden
hair
she
slipped
silently
into
her
seat
cautiously
glancing
at
the
master
of
the
house
then
she
began
to
stir
her
coffee
young
woman
tellwright
said
curtly
she
looked
a
startled
interrogative
waiting
he
explained

agnes
confused
thought

this
food
to
our
use
and
us
to
his
service
for

sake
amen
the
breakfast
proceeded
in
silence
breakfast
at
eight
dinner
at
noon
tea
at
four
supper
at
eight
all
the
meals
in
this
house
occurred
with
absolute
precision
and
sameness
tellwright
seldom
spoke
and
his
example
imposed
silence
on
the
girls
who
felt
as
nuns
feel
when
assisting
at
some
grave
but
monotonous
and
perfunctory
rite
the
room
was
not
a
cheerful
one
in
the
morning
since
the
window
was
small
and
the
aspect
westerly
besides
the
table
and
three
chairs
the
furniture
consisted
of
an
a
rocking
chair
and
a
a
fatigued
brussels
carpet
covered
the
floor
over
the
mantelpiece
was
an
engraving
of
light
of
the
world
in
a
frame
of
polished
brown
wood
on
the
other
walls
were
some
family
photographs
in
black
frames
a
chandelier
hung
from
the
ceiling
weighed
down
on
one
side
by
a
patent
mantle
and
a
glass
shade
over
this
the
ceiling
was
deeply
discoloured
on
either
side
of
the
were
cupboards
about
three
feet
high
some
cardboard
boxes
a
and
agnes
school
books
lay
on
the
tops
of
these
cupboards
on
the
was
a
pot
of
mignonette
in
a
saucer
the
window
was
wide
open
and
flies
buzzed
to
and
fro
constantly
rebounding
from
the
window
panes
with
terrible
thuds
in
the
yard
beyond
the
cat
was
licking
himself
in
the
sunlight
with
an
air
of
being
wholly
absorbed
in
his
task
tellwright
demanded
a
second
and
last
cup
of
coffee
and
having
drunk
it
pushed
away
his
plate
as
a
sign
that
he
had
finished
then
he
took
from
the
mantelpiece
at
his
right
hand
a
bundle
of
letters
and
opened
them
methodically
when
he
had
arranged
the
correspondence
in
a
flattened
pile
he
put
on
his
spectacles
and
began
to
read
i
return
thanks
father
agnes
asked
and
he
nodded
looking
at
her
fixedly
over
his
spectacles
god
for
our
good
breakfast
amen
in
two
minutes
the
table
was
cleared
and
tellwright
was
alone
as
he
read
laboriously
through
communications
from
solicitors
secretaries
of
companies
and
tenants
he
could
hear
his
daughters
talking
together
in
the
kitchen
anna
was
washing
the
breakfast
things
while
agnes
wiped
then
there
were
flying
steps
across
the
yard
agnes
had
gone
to
school
after
he
had
mastered
his
correspondence
tellwright
took
up
the
trowel
again
and
finished
the
in
the
lobby
then
he
resumed
his
coat
and
gathering
together
the
letters
from
the
table
in
the
back
parlour
went
into
the
front
parlour
and
shut
the
door
this
room
was
his
office
the
principal
things
in
it
were
an
old
oak
bureau
and
an
old
oak
which
had
come
to
him
from
his
first
father
on
the
walls
were
some
sombre
landscapes
in
oil
received
from
the
same
source
there
was
no
carpet
on
the
floor
and
only
one
other
chair
a
safe
stood
in
the
corner
opposite
the
door
on
the
mantelpiece
were
some
books
woodfall
and
tenant
to
company
law
whitaker
almanack
and
a
gazetteer
of
the
five
towns
several
wire
files
loaded
with
papers
hung
from
the
mantelpiece
with
the
exception
of
a
mahogany
with
a
bible
on
it
which
stood
in
front
of
the
window
there
was
nothing
else
whatever
in
the
room
he
sat
down
to
the
bureau
and
opened
it
and
took
from
one
of
the
a
packet
of
various
documents
these
he
examined
one
by
one
from
time
to
time
referring
to
a
list
then
he
unlocked
the
safe
and
extracted
from
it
another
bundle
of
documents
which
had
evidently
been
placed
ready
with
these
in
his
hand
he
opened
the
door
and
called
out
father
her
voice
came
from
the
kitchen
want
ye
a
minute
i
peeling
potatoes
when
she
came
in
she
found
him
seated
at
the
bureau
as
usual
he
did
not
look
round
father
she
stood
there
in
her
print
dress
and
white
apron
full
in
the
eye
of
the
sun
waiting
for
him
she
could
not
guess
what
she
had
been
summoned
for
as
a
rule
she
never
saw
her
father
between
breakfast
and
dinner
at
length
he
turned
he
said
in
his
harsh
abrupt
tones
and
then
stopped
for
a
moment
before
continuing
his
thick
short
fingers
held
the
list
which
he
had
previously
been
consulting
she
waited
in
bewilderment

the

regular
he
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
his
pride
in
these
investments
and
he
had
the
right
to
be
proud
of
them
they
were
the
finest
in
the
market
the
aristocracy
of
investments
based
on
commercial
enterprises
of
which
every
business
man
in
the
five
towns
knew
the
entire
soundness
they
conferred
distinction
on
the
possessor
like
a
great
picture
or
a
rare
volume
they
stifled
all
questions
and
insinuations
put
before
any
jury
of
the
five
towns
as
evidence
of
character
they
would
almost
have
exculpated
a
murderer
anna
continued
reading
the
list
which
seemed
endless
long
before
she
had
reached
the
last
item
her
brain
was
a
menagerie
of
monstrous
figures
the
list
included
besides
all
sorts
of
shares
english
and
american
sundry
properties
in
the
five
towns
and
among
these
was
the
earthenware
manufactory
in
edward
street
occupied
by
titus
price
the
superintendent
anna
was
a
little
alarmed
to
find
herself
the
owner
of
this
works
she
knew
that
her
father
had
had
some
difficult
moments
with
titus
price
and
that
the
property
was
not
without
grave
disadvantages
all
tellwright
asked
at
length
all
face
value
he
went
on
i
value
it
thousand
and
fifty
pounds
producing
a
net
annual
income
of
three
thousand
two
hundred
and
ninety
pounds
or
thereabouts
there
not
many
in
this
district
as
gotten

nor
half
that
let

a
back
yard
am
i
to
do

she
asked
plaintively
wi
it
he
repeated
and
stood
up
and
faced
her
putting
his
lips
together
wi
it
did
ye
say
care

it
my
girl
tak
care
on
it
and
remember

quietly

he
replied
tak
th
pen
and
let
have
thy
signature
she
signed
her
name
many
times
and
put
her
finger
on
many
seals
then
tellwright
gathered
up
everything
into
a
bundle
and
gave
it
to
her
to
hold
the
lot
he
said
ye
gotten
she
said
they
both
smiled
as
for
tellwright
he
was
evidently
impressed
by
the
grandeur
of
this
superb
renunciation
on
his
part
i

he
took

but
i
sha

to
do
gotten
a
tongue
in
that
noddle
of
yours
have
ye
he
said
go
and
get
along
wi
them
potatoes
anna
returned
to
the
kitchen
she
felt
no
elation
or
ferment
of
any
kind
she
had
not
begun
to
realise
the
significance
of
what
had
occurred
like
the
soldier
whom
a
bullet
has
struck
she
only
knew
vaguely
that
something
had
occurred
she
peeled
the
potatoes
with
more
than
her
usual
thrifty
care
the
peel
was
so
thin
as
to
be
almost
transparent
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
not
arrange
or
examine
her
emotions
until
after
she
had
met
henry
mynors
again
more
than
anything
else
she
wished
to
see
him
it
was
as
if
out
of
the
mere
sight
of
him
something
definite
might
emerge
as
if
when
her
eyes
had
rested
on
him
and
not
before
she
might
perceive
some
simple
solution
of
the
problems
which
she
had
obscurely
discerned
ahead
of
her
during
dinner
a
boy
brought
a
note
for
her
father
he
read
it
snorted
and
threw
it
across
the
table
to
anna
he
said
your
affair
the
letter
was
from
titus
price
it
said
that
he
was
sorry
to
be
compelled
to
break
his
promise
but
it
was
quite
impossible
for
him
to
pay
twenty
pounds
on
account
of
rent
that
day
he
would
endeavour
to
pay
at
least
twenty
pounds
in
a
week
time
better
call
there
after
you
been
to
th
bank
said
tellwright
get
summat
out
of
him
if
it
only
ten
pun
i
go
to
edward
street
am
i
to
say
i
never
been
there
before
it
high
time
as
ye
began
to
look
after
your
own
property
you
mun
see
owd
price
and
tell
him
ye
canna
accept
any
excuses
much
does
he
owe
owes
ye
a
hundred
and
pun
altogether
he
five
quarters
in
arrear
hundred
and
well
i
never
anna
was
aghast
the
sum
appeared
larger
to
her
than
all
the
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
which
she
had
received
in
the
morning
she
reflected
that
the
weekly
bills
of
the
household
amounted
to
about
a
sovereign
and
that
the
total
of
this
debt
of
price
would
therefore
keep
them
in
food
for
two
years
the
idea
of
being
in
debt
was
abhorrent
to
her
she
could
not
conceive
how
a
man
who
was
in
debt
could
sleep
at
nights
price
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
she
said
warmly
sure
he
quite
able
to
pay
the
image
of
the
sleek
and
stout
superintendent
of
the
arrayed
in
his
rich
almost
voluptuous
broadcloth
offended
her
profoundly
that
he
debtor
and
should
have
the
effrontery
to
pray
for
the
souls
of
children
to
chastise
their
petty
furtive
crimes
was
nearly
incredible
price
is
all
her
father
remarked
with
an
apparent
benignity
which
surprised
her
pay
when
he
can
think
it
a
shame
she
repeated
emphatically
agnes
looked
with
a
mystified
air
from
one
to
the
other
instinctively
divining
that
something
very
extraordinary
had
happened
during
her
absence
at
school
be
too
hard
anna
said
tellwright
ye
sold
owd
titus
up
what
then
d
reckon
ye
get
a
tenant
for
them
ramshackle
works
a
thousand
pound
spent
would
a
tenant
that
edward
street
property
was
one
o
ye
grandfeyther
specs
none
o
mine
you
best
tak
what
ye
can
get
anna
felt
a
little
ashamed
of
herself
not
because
of
her
bad
policy
but
because
she
saw
that
price
might
have
been
handicapped
by
the
faults
of
her
property
that
afternoon
it
was
a
shy
and
timid
anna
who
swung
back
the
heavy
polished
and
glazed
portals
of
the
bursley
branch
of
the
birmingham
sheffield
and
district
bank
the
opulent
and
spacious
erection
which
stands
commandingly
at
the
top
of
luke
square
she
looked
about
her
across
broad
counters
enormous
ledgers
and
rows
of
bent
heads
and
wondered
whom
she
should
address
then
a
bearded
gentleman
who
was
weighing
gold
in
a
balance
caught
sight
of
her
he
slid
the
gold
into
a
drawer
and
whisked
round
the
end
of
the
counter
with
a
celerity
which
was
at
any
rate
not
born
of
practice
for
he
the
cashier
had
not
done
such
a
thing
for
years
afternoon
miss
tellwright
afternoon
i
i
trouble
you
to
step
into
the
manager
room
and
he
drew
her
forward
while
every
clerk
eye
watched
anna
tried
not
to
blush
but
she
could
feel
the
red
mounting
even
to
her
temples
weather
we
having
but
of
course
we
the
right
to
expect
it
at
this
time
of
year
he
opened
a
door
on
the
glass
of
which
was
painted
and
bowed
lovatt
miss
tellwright
lovatt
greeted
his
new
customer
with
a
formal
and
rather
fatigued
politeness
and
invited
her
to
sit
in
a
large
leather
armchair
in
front
of
a
large
table
on
this
table
lay
a
large
open
book
anna
had
once
in
her
life
been
to
the
dentist
this
interview
reminded
her
of
that
experience
father
told
me
i
might
expect
you
said
lovatt
in
his
perfunctory
tones
richard
lovatt
was
probably
the
most
influential
man
in
bursley
every
saturday
morning
he
irrigated
the
whole
town
with
fertilising
gold
by
a
single
negative
he
could
have
ruined
scores
of
upright
merchants
and
manufacturers
he
had
only
to
stop
a
man
in
the
street
and
murmur
the
way
your
overdraft
in
order
to
spread
discord
and
desolation
through
a
refined
and
pious
home
his
estimate
of
human
nature
was
falsified
by
no
common
illusions
he
had
the
impassive
and
frosty
gaze
of
a
criminal
judge
many
men
deemed
they
had
cause
to
hate
him
but
no
one
did
hate
him
all
recognised
that
he
was
set
far
above
hatred
sign
your
full
name
here
he
said
pointing
to
a
spot
on
the
large
open
page
of
the
book
your
ordinary

which
you
will
attach
to
cheques
here
anna
wrote
but
in
doing
so
she
became
aware
that
she
had
no
ordinary
signature
she
was
obliged
to
invent
one
you
wish
to
draw
anything
out
now
there
is
already
a
credit
of
four
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
in
your
favour
said
lovatt
after
he
had
handed
her
a
a
and
a
no
thank
you
anna
answered
quickly
she
keenly
desired
some
money
but
she
well
knew
that
courage
would
fail
her
to
demand
it
without
her
father
consent
moreover
she
was
in
a
whirl
of
uncertainty
as
to
the
uses
of
the
three
books
though
lovatt
had
expounded
them
severally
to
her
in
simple
language
miss
tellwright
compliments
to
your
father
his
final
glance
said
half
cynically
half
in
pity
are
naïve
and
unspoilt
now
but
these
eyes
will
see
yours
harden
like
the
rest
wretched
victim
of
gold
you
are
only
one
in
a
procession
after
all
outside
anna
thought
that
everyone
had
been
very
agreeable
to
her
her
complacency
increased
at
a
bound
she
no
longer
felt
ashamed
of
her
shabby
cotton
dress
she
surmised
that
people
would
find
it
convenient
to
ignore
any
difference
which
might
exist
between
her
costume
and
that
of
other
girls
she
went
on
to
edward
street
a
short
steep
thoroughfare
at
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
town
leading
into
a
rough
road
across
unoccupied
land
dotted
with
the
mouths
of
abandoned
pits
this
road
climbed
up
to
toft
end
a
mean
annexe
of
the
town
about
half
a
mile
east
of
bleakridge
from
toft
end
lying
on
the
highest
hill
in
the
district
one
had
a
panoramic
view
of
hanbridge
and
bursley
with
hillport
to
the
west
and
all
the
moorland
and
mining
villages
to
the
north
and
titus
price
and
his
son
lived
in
what
had
once
been
a
at
toft
end
every
morning
and
evening
they
traversed
the
desolate
and
featureless
grey
road
between
their
dwelling
and
the
works
anna
had
never
been
in
edward
street
before
it
was
a
miserable
quarter
two
rows
of
blackened
infinitesimal
cottages
and
her
manufactory
at
the
end
a
frontier
post
of
the
town
price
works
was
small
and
out
of
repair
one
of
those
properties
which
are
forlorn
from
the
beginning
which
bring
despair
into
the
hearts
of
a
succession
of
owners
and
which
being
ultimately
deserted
seem
to
stand
for
ever
in
pitiable
ruin
the
arched
entrance
for
carts
into
the
yard
was
at
the
top
of
the
steepest
rise
of
the
street
when
it
might
as
well
have
been
at
the
bottom
and
this
was
but
one
example
of
the
architect
fine
disregard
for
the
principle
of
economy
in
working
that
principle
to
which
in
the
scheming
of
manufactories
everything
else
is
now
so
strictly
subordinated
ephraim
tellwright
used
to
say
but
not
to
titus
price
that
the
situation
of
that
archway
cost
five
pounds
a
year
in
horseflesh
and
that
five
pounds
was
the
interest
on
a
hundred
the
place
was
badly
located
badly
planned
and
badly
constructed
its
faults
defied
improvement
titus
price
remained
in
it
only
because
he
was
chained
there
by
arrears
of
rent
tellwright
hesitated
to
sell
it
only
because
the
rent
was
a
hundred
a
year
and
the
whole
freehold
would
not
have
fetched
eight
hundred
he
promised
repairs
in
exchange
for
payment
of
arrears
which
he
knew
would
never
be
paid
and
his
policy
was
to
squeeze
the
last
penny
out
of
price
without
forcing
him
into
bankruptcy
such
was
the
predicament
when
anna
assumed
ownership
as
she
surveyed
the
irregular
and
huddled
frontage
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
her
first
feeling
was
one
of
depression
at
the
broken
and
dirty
panes
of
the
windows
a
man
in
was
standing
on
the
weighing
platform
under
the
archway
his
back
was
towards
her
but
she
could
see
the
smoke
issuing
in
puffs
from
his
pipe
she
crossed
the
road
hearing
her
footfalls
the
man
turned
round
it
was
titus
price
himself
he
was
wearing
an
apron
but
no
cap
the
sleeves
of
his
shirt
were
rolled
up
exposing
forearms
covered
with
auburn
hair
his
puffed
heavy
face
and
general
bigness
and
untidiness
gave
the
idea
of
a
vast
and
torpid
male
slattern
anna
was
astounded
by
the
contrast
between
the
titus
of
sunday
and
the
titus
of
monday
a
single
glance
compelled
her
to
readjust
all
her
notions
of
the
man
she
stammered
a
greeting
and
he
replied
and
then
they
were
both
silent
for
a
moment
in
the
pause
price
thrust
his
pipe
between
apron
and
waistcoat
inside
miss
tellwright
he
said
with
a
sickly
conciliatory
smile
into
the
office
will
ye
she
followed
him
without
a
word
through
the
archway
to
the
right
was
an
open
door
into
the
where
a
man
surrounded
by
straw
was
packing
basins
in
a
crate
with
swift
precise
movements
twisting
straw
between
basin
and
basin
he
forced
piles
of
ware
into
a
space
inconceivably
small
price
lingered
to
watch
him
for
a
few
seconds
and
passed
on
they
were
in
the
yard
a
small
quadrangle
paved
with
black
greasy
mud
in
one
corner
a
load
of
coal
had
been
cast
in
another
lay
a
heap
of
broken
saggars
decrepit
doorways
led
to
the
various
on
the
ground
floor
those
on
the
upper
floor
were
reached
by
narrow
wooden
stairs
which
seemed
to
cling
insecurely
to
the
exterior
walls
up
one
of
these
stairways
price
climbed
with
heavy
elephantine
movements
anna
prudently
waited
till
he
had
reached
the
top
before
beginning
to
ascend
he
pushed
open
a
flimsy
door
and
with
a
nod
bade
her
enter
the
office
was
a
long
narrow
room
the
dirtiest
that
anna
had
ever
seen
if
such
was
the
condition
of
the
master
quarters
she
thought
what
must
the
workshops
be
like
the
ceiling
which
bulged
downwards
was
as
black
as
the
floor
which
sank
away
in
the
middle
till
it
was
hollow
like
a
saucer
the
revolution
of
an
engine
somewhere
below
shook
everything
with
a
periodic
muffled
thud
a
greyish
light
came
through
one
small
window
by
the
window
was
a
large
double
desk
with
chairs
facing
each
other
one
of
these
chairs
was
occupied
by
willie
price
the
youth
did
not
observe
at
first
that
another
person
had
come
in
with
his
father
he
was
casting
up
figures
in
an
account
book
and
murmuring
numbers
to
himself
he
wore
an
office
coat
short
at
the
wrists
and
torn
at
the
elbows
and
a
battered
felt
hat
was
thrust
far
back
over
his
head
so
that
the
brim
rested
on
his
dirty
collar
he
turned
round
at
length
and
on
seeing
anna
blushed
brilliant
crimson
and
rose
scraping
the
legs
of
his
chair
horribly
across
the
floor
tall
thin
and
ungainly
in
every
motion
he
had
the
look
of
a
ninny
it
was
the
fact
that
at
school
all
the
boys
by
a
common
instinct
had
combined
to
tease
him
and
that
on
the
works
the
young
paintresses
continually
made
private
sport
of
him
anna
however
had
not
the
least
impulse
to
mock
him
in
her
thoughts
for
her
there
was
nothing
in
his
blue
eyes
but
simplicity
and
good
intentions
beside
him
she
felt
old
sagacious
crafty
it
seemed
to
her
that
some
one
ought
to
shield
that
transparent
and
confiding
soul
from
his
father
and
the
intriguing
world
he
spoke
to
her
and
lifted
his
hat
holding
it
afterwards
in
his
great
bony
hand
down
to
th
entry
will
said
his
father
and
willie
with
an
apologetic
sort
of
cough
slipped
silently
away
through
the
door
down
miss
tellwright
said
old
price
and
she
took
the
windsor
chair
that
had
been
occupied
by
willie
her
tenant
fell
into
the
seat
opposite
a
leathern
chair
from
which
the
stuffing
had
exuded
and
with
one
of
its
arms
broken
hear
as
ye
father
is
going
into
partnership
with
young
mynors
henry
mynors
anna
started
at
this
surprising
item
of
news
which
was
entirely
fresh
to
her
has
said
nothing
to
me
about
it
she
replied
coldly
happen
i
said
too
much
if
so
you
excuse
me
miss
a
smart
fellow
mynors
now

see
little

bursley

make
money
there
this
works
miss
tellwright
wants
mendin
with
a
new
looks
very
dirty
i
must
say
said
anna
he
laughed
a
short
acrid
laugh
suppose
you
called
about
the
rent
father
asked
me
to
call
me
see
this
place
belongs
to
you
i
your
own
right

anna
mine
from
my
grandfather

pounds

a
week
tell
ye
father

twenty
pound
in
a
week
what
you
said
last
week
anna
remarked
with
more
brusqueness
than
she
had
intended
at
first
she
was
fearful
at
her
own
temerity
in
thus
addressing
a
superintendent
of
the
then
as
nothing
happened
she
felt
reassured
and
strong
in
the
justice
of
her
position
he
admitted
obsequiously
i
been
disappointed
one
of
our
best
customers
put
us
off
to
tell
ye
the
truth
money
tight
very
tight
it
got
to
be
give
and
take

these
days
as
ye
father

and
i
may
as
well
speak
plain
to
ye
miss
tellwright
we
canna
stay
here
we
shall
be
compelled
to
give
ye
notice
amiss
with
this
bank
is
that
it
wants
pullin
down
he
went
off
into
a
rapid
enumeration
of
alterations
and
repairs
that
must
be
done
without
the
loss
of
a
moment
and
concluded
tell
ye
father
what
i
told
ye
and
say
as
i
send
up
twenty
pounds
next
week
i
ca
pay
anything
now
i
nothing
by
me
at
all
said
particularly
i
was
to
be
sure
and
get
something
on
account
there
was
a
flinty
hardness
in
her
tone
which
astonished
herself
perhaps
more
than
titus
price
a
long
pause
followed
and
then
price
drew
a
breath
seeming
to
nerve
himself
to
a
tremendous
sacrificial
deed
tell
ye
what
i
do
i
give
ye
ten
pounds
now
and
i
do
what
i
can
next
week
i
do
what
i
can
there
you
said
anna
she
was
amazed
at
her
success
he
unlocked
the
desk
and
his
head
disappeared
under
the
lifted
lid
anna
gazed
through
the
window
like
many
women
and
not
a
few
men
in
the
five
towns
she
was
wholly
ignorant
of
the
staple
manufacture
the
interior
of
a
works
was
almost
as
strange
to
her
as
it
would
have
been
to
a
from
sussex
a
girl
came
out
of
a
door
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
quadrangle
the
creature
was
clothed
in
clayey
rags
and
carried
on
her
right
shoulder
a
board
laden
with
biscuit
cups
she
began
to
mount
one
of
the
wooden
stairways
and
as
she
did
so
the
board
six
feet
in
length
swayed
alarmingly
to
and
fro
anna
expected
to
see
it
fall
with
a
destructive
crash
but
the
girl
went
up
in
safety
and
with
a
nonchalant
jerk
of
the
shoulder
aimed
the
end
of
the
board
through
another
door
and
vanished
from
sight
to
anna
it
was
a
thrilling
feat
but
she
noticed
that
a
man
who
stood
in
the
yard
did
not
even
turn
his
head
to
watch
it
price
recalled
her
to
the
business
of
her
errand
two
fives
he
said
shutting
down
the
desk
with
the
sigh
of
a
crocodile
you
said
you
had
nothing
her
unspoken
thought
ran
and
at
the
same
instant
the
and
everything
connected
with
it
grievously
sank
in
her
estimation
she
contrasted
this
scene
with
that
on
the
previous
day
with
the
peccant
schoolgirl
it
was
an
hour
of
disillusion
taking
the
notes
she
gave
a
receipt
and
rose
to
go
ye
father
it
seemed
to
anna
that
this
phrase
was
always
on
his
lips
ye
father
he
must
come
down
and
look
at
the
state
this
place
is
in
said
price
enheartened
by
the
heroic
payment
of
ten
pounds
anna
said
nothing
she
thought
a
fire
would
do
more
good
than
anything
else
to
the
foul
squalid
buildings
the
passing
fancy
coincided
with
price
secret
and
most
intense
desire
outside
she
saw
willie
price
superintending
the
lifting
of
a
crate
on
to
a
railway
lorry
after
twirling
in
the
air
the
crate
sank
safely
into
the
waggon
young
price
was
perspiring
afternoon
miss
tellwright
he
called
to
her
as
she
passed
with
his
pleasant
bashful
smile
she
gave
an
affirmative
then
he
came
to
her
still
smiling
his
face
full
of
an
intention
to
say
something
however
insignificant
suppose
you
be
at
the
special
teachers
meeting
night
he
remarked
hope
to
be
she
said
that
was
all
william
had
achieved
his
they
parted
father
and
mynors
are
going
into
partnership
she
kept
saying
to
herself
on
the
way
home
bank
manufactory
biscuit
a
term
applied
to
ware
which
has
been
fired
only
once
chapter
iv
a
visit
the
special
teachers
meeting
to
which
willie
price
had
referred
was
one
of
the
final
preliminaries
to
a
revival
that
is
a
revival
of
godliness
and
christian
grace
about
to
be
undertaken
by
the
wesleyan
methodist
society
in
bursley
its
object
was
to
arrange
for
a
personal
visitation
of
the
parents
of
scholars
in
their
homes
hitherto
anna
had
felt
but
little
interest
in
the
revival
it
had
several
times
been
brought
indirectly
before
her
notice
but
she
had
regarded
it
as
a
phenomenon
which
recurred
at
intervals
in
the
cycle
of
religious
activity
and
as
not
in
any
way
affecting
herself
the
gradual
centring
of
public
interest
however
that
mysterious
movement
which
defying
analysis
gathers
force
as
it
proceeds
and
ends
by
coercing
the
most
indifferent
had
already
modified
her
attitude
towards
this
forthcoming
event
it
got
about
that
the
preacher
who
had
been
engaged
a
specialist
in
revivals
was
a
man
of
miraculous
powers
the
number
of
souls
which
he
had
snatched
from
eternal
torment
was
precisely
stated
and
it
amounted
to
tens
of
thousands
he
played
the
cornet
to
the
glory
of
god
and
his
cornet
was
of
silver
his
more
distant
past
had
been
ineffably
wicked
and
the
faint
rumour
of
that
dead
wickedness
clung
to
his
name
like
a
piquant
odour
as
anna
walked
up
trafalgar
road
from
price
she
observed
that
the
hoardings
had
been
billed
with
great
posters
announcing
the
revival
and
the
revivalist
who
was
to
commence
his
work
on
friday
night
during
tea
tellwright
interrupted
his
perusal
of
the
evening
to
give
utterance
to
a
rather
remarkable
speech
us
he
said
old
trumpeter
turn
the
town
upside
down
you
mean
the
revivalist
father
anna
asked
a
beautiful
man
agnes
exclaimed
with
enthusiasm
teacher
showed
us
his
portrait
after
school
this
afternoon
i
never
saw
such
a
beautiful
man
her
father
gazed
hard
at
the
child
for
an
instant
cup
in
hand
and
then
turned
to
anna
with
a
slightly
sardonic
air
are
you
doing
i
this
revival
anna
she
said
there
a
teachers
meeting
about
it
night
and
i
have
to
go
to
that
young
price
mentioned
it
to
me
specially
a
pause
followed
get
anything
out
o
price
tellwright
asked
he
gave
me
ten
pounds
he
wants
you
to
go
and
look
over
the
works
says
they
falling
to
pieces
i
reckon
she
corrected
the
surmise
give
me
them
notes
anna
he
said
after
tea
going
to
th
bank
i
th
morning
and
i
pay
in
to
your
account
there
was
no
reason
why
she
should
not
have
suggested
the
propriety
of
keeping
at
least
one
of
the
notes
for
her
private
use
but
she
dared
not
she
had
never
any
money
of
her
own
not
a
penny
and
the
effective
possession
of
five
pounds
seemed
far
too
audacious
a
dream
she
hesitated
to
imagine
her
father
reply
to
such
a
request
even
to
frame
the
request
to
herself
the
thing
viewed
close
was
utterly
impossible
and
when
she
relinquished
the
notes
she
also
without
being
asked
gave
up
her
and
she
did
this
while
ardently
desiring
to
refrain
from
doing
it
as
it
were
under
the
compulsion
of
an
invincible
instinct
afterwards
she
felt
more
at
ease
as
though
some
disturbing
question
had
been
settled
once
and
for
all
during
the
whole
of
that
evening
she
timorously
expected
mynors
saying
to
herself
however
that
he
certainly
would
not
call
before
thursday
on
tuesday
evening
she
started
early
for
the
teachers
meeting
her
intention
was
to
arrive
among
the
first
and
to
choose
a
seat
in
obscurity
since
she
knew
well
that
every
eye
would
be
upon
her
she
was
divided
between
the
desire
to
see
mynors
and
the
desire
to
avoid
the
ordeal
of
being
seen
by
her
colleagues
in
his
presence
she
trembled
lest
she
should
be
incapable
of
commanding
her
mien
so
as
to
appear
unconscious
of
this
inspection
by
curious
eyes
the
meeting
was
held
in
a
large
furnished
with
wooden
seats
a
chair
and
a
small
table
on
the
grey
distempered
walls
hung
a
few
biblical
cartoons
depicting
scenes
in
the
life
of
joseph
and
his
brethren
but
without
reference
to
potiphar
wife
from
the
whitewashed
ceiling
depended
a
one
burner
of
which
showed
a
glimmer
though
the
sun
had
not
yet
set
the
evening
was
oppressively
warm
and
through
the
window
came
the
faint
effluvium
of
populous
cottages
and
the
distant
but
raucous
cries
of
children
at
play
when
anna
entered
a
group
of
young
men
were
talking
eagerly
round
the
table
among
these
was
willie
price
who
greeted
her
no
others
had
come
she
sat
down
in
a
corner
by
the
door
invisible
except
from
within
the
room
gradually
the
place
began
to
fill
then
at
last
mynors
entered
anna
recognised
his
authoritative
step
before
she
saw
him
he
walked
quickly
to
the
chair
in
front
of
the
table
and
including
all
in
a
friendly
and
generous
smile
said
that
in
the
absence
of
titus
price
it
fell
to
him
to
take
the
chair
he
was
glad
that
so
many
had
made
a
point
of
being
present
everyone
sat
down
he
gave
out
a
hymn
and
led
the
singing
himself
attacking
the
first
note
with
an
assurance
born
of
practice
then
he
prayed
and
as
he
prayed
anna
gazed
at
him
intently
he
was
standing
up
the
ends
of
his
fingers
pressed
against
the
top
of
the
table
very
carefully
dressed
as
usual
he
wore
a
brilliant
new
red
necktie
and
a
gardenia
in
his
he
seemed
happy
wholesome
earnest
and
unaffected
he
had
the
elasticity
of
youth
with
the
firm
wisdom
of
age
and
it
was
as
if
he
had
never
been
younger
and
would
never
grow
older
remaining
always
at
just
thirty
and
in
his
prime
incomparable
to
the
rest
he
was
clearly
born
to
lead
he
fulfilled
his
functions
with
tact
grace
and
dignity
in
such
an
affair
as
this
present
he
disclosed
the
attributes
of
the
skilled
workman
whose
easy
and
exact
movements
are
a
joy
and
wonder
to
the
beholder
and
behind
all
was
the
man
his
excellent
and
strong
nature
his
kindliness
his
sincerity
yes
to
anna
mynors
was
perfect
that
night
the
reality
of
him
exceeded
her
dreamy
meditations
fearful
on
the
brink
of
an
ecstatic
bliss
she
could
scarcely
believe
that
from
the
enticements
of
a
thousand
women
this
paragon
had
been
preserved
for
her
like
most
of
us
she
lacked
the
high
courage
to
grasp
happiness
boldly
and
without
apprehension
she
had
not
learnt
that
nothing
is
too
good
to
be
true
mynors
prayer
was
a
cogent
appeal
for
the
success
of
the
revival
he
knew
what
he
wanted
and
confidently
asked
for
it
approaching
god
with
humility
but
with
the
prayer
was
punctuated
by
amens
from
various
parts
of
the
room
the
atmosphere
became
suddenly
fervent
emotional
and
devout
here
was
lofty
endeavour
idealism
a
burning
spirituality
and
not
all
the
pettinesses
unavoidable
in
such
an
organisation
as
a
could
hide
the
difference
between
this
impassioned
altruism
and
the
ignoble
selfishness
of
the
worldly
anna
felt
as
she
had
often
felt
before
but
more
acutely
now
that
she
existed
only
on
the
fringe
of
the
methodist
society
she
had
not
been
converted
technically
she
was
a
lost
creature
the
converted
knew
it
and
in
some
subtle
way
their
bearing
towards
her
and
others
in
her
case
always
showed
that
they
knew
it
why
did
she
teach
not
from
the
impulse
of
religious
zeal
why
was
she
allowed
to
have
charge
of
a
class
of
immortal
souls
the
blind
could
not
lead
the
blind
nor
the
lost
save
the
lost
these
considerations
troubled
her
conscience
pricked
accusing
her
of
a
continual
pretence
the
of
professing
christian
through
false
shame
had
seemed
distasteful
to
her
she
had
said
that
she
could
never
stand
up
and
say
am
for
christ
without
being
uncomfortable
but
now
she
was
ashamed
of
her
inability
to
profess
christ
she
could
conceive
herself
proud
and
happy
in
the
very
part
which
formerly
she
had
despised
it
was
these
believers
workers
exhorters
wrestlers
with
satan
who
had
the
right
to
disdain
not
she
at
that
moment
as
if
divining
her
thoughts
mynors
prayed
for
those
among
them
who
were
not
converted
she
blushed
and
when
the
prayer
was
finished
she
feared
lest
every
eye
might
seek
hers
in
inquiry
but
no
one
seemed
to
notice
her
mynors
sat
down
and
seated
began
to
explain
the
arrangements
for
the
revival
he
made
it
plain
that
prayers
without
industry
would
not
achieve
success
his
remarks
revealed
the
fact
that
underneath
the
broad
religious
structure
of
the
enterprise
and
supporting
it
there
was
a
basis
of
individual
diplomacy
and
solicitation
the
town
had
been
mapped
out
into
districts
and
each
of
these
was
being
importuned
as
at
an
election
by
the
thoroughness
and
instancy
of
this
canvass
quite
as
much
as
by
the
intensity
of
prayerful
desire
would
christ
conquer
the
affair
was
a
campaign
before
it
was
a
prostration
at
the
throne
of
grace
he
spoke
of
the
children
saying
that
in
connection
with
these
they
the
teachers
had
at
once
the
highest
privilege
and
the
most
sacred
responsibility
he
told
of
a
special
service
for
the
children
and
the
need
of
visiting
them
in
their
homes
and
inviting
the
parents
also
to
this
feast
of
god
he
wished
every
teacher
during
and
the
next
day
and
the
next
day
to
go
through
the
list
of
his
or
her
scholars
names
and
call
if
possible
at
every
house
there
must
be
no
shirking
you
ladies
do
that
he
exclaimed
with
an
appealing
serious
smile
you
miss
dickinson
will
you
miss
machin
will
you
salt
will
you
miss
sutton
will
you
until
at
last
it
came
you
miss
tellwright
will
she
answered
with
averted
eyes
you
thank
you
all
some
others
spoke
hopefully
enthusiastically
and
one
or
two
prayed
then
mynors
rose
the
blessing
of
god
the
father
the
son
and
the
holy
ghost
rest
upon
us
now
and
for
ever
someone
ejaculated
the
meeting
was
over
anna
passed
rapidly
out
of
he
door
down
the
quadrangle
and
into
trafalgar
road
she
was
the
first
to
leave
daring
not
to
stay
in
the
room
a
moment
she
had
seen
him
he
had
not
altered
since
sunday
there
was
no
disillusion
but
a
deepening
of
the
original
impression
caught
up
by
the
soaring
of
his
spirit
her
spirit
lifted
and
she
was
conscious
of
vague
but
intense
longing
skyward
she
could
not
reason
or
think
in
that
dizzying
hour
but
she
made
resolutions
which
had
no
verbal
form
yielding
eagerly
to
his
influence
and
his
appeal
not
till
she
had
reached
the
bottom
of
duck
bank
and
was
breasting
the
first
rise
towards
bleakridge
did
her
pace
slacken
then
a
voice
called
to
her
from
behind
she
recognised
it
and
turned
sharply
beneath
the
shock
mynors
raised
his
hat
and
greeted
her
coming
to
see
your
father
he
said
she
said
and
gave
him
her
hand
was
a
very
satisfactory
meeting
he
began
and
in
a
moment
they
were
talking
seriously
of
the
revival
with
the
most
oblique
delicacy
the
most
perfect
assumption
of
equality
between
them
he
allowed
her
to
perceive
his
genuine
and
profound
anxiety
for
her
spiritual
welfare
the
atmosphere
of
the
meeting
was
still
round
about
him
the
divine
fire
still
uncooled
hope
you
will
come
to
the
first
service
on
friday
night
he
pleaded
must
she
replied
yes
i
shall
come
is
good
he
said
particularly
wanted
your
promise
they
were
at
the
door
of
the
house
agnes
obviously
expectant
and
excited
answered
the
bell
with
an
effort
anna
and
mynors
passed
into
a
lighter
mood
said
you
were
coming
mynors
said
agnes
and
turning
to
anna
set
supper
all
myself
you
mynors
laughed
you
must
let
me
give
you
a
kiss
for
that
he
bent
down
and
kissed
her
she
holding
up
her
face
to
his
with
no
reluctance
anna
looked
on
smiling
tellwright
sat
near
the
window
of
the
back
parlour
reading
the
paper
twilight
was
at
hand
he
lowered
his
head
as
mynors
entered
with
agnes
in
train
so
as
to
see
over
his
spectacles
which
were
down
his
nose
d
do
mynors
i
was
just
going
to
begin
my
supper
i
do
wait
you
know
and
he
glanced
at
the
table
right
said
mynors
long
as
you
would
eat
it
all
would
he
have
eaten
it
all
agnes
do
you
think
agnes
pressed
her
head
against
mynors
arm
and
laughed
shyly
the
old
man
sardonically
chuckled
anna
who
was
still
in
the
passage
wondered
what
could
be
on
the
table
if
it
was
only
the
usual
morsel
of
cheese
she
felt
that
she
should
expire
of
mortification
she
peeped
the
cheese
was
at
one
end
and
at
the
other
a
joint
of
beef
scarcely
touched
nay
said
tellwright
as
if
he
had
been
engaged
some
seconds
upon
the
joke
have
saved
ye
the
bone
anna
went
upstairs
to
take
off
her
hat
and
immediately
agnes
flew
after
her
the
child
was
breathless
with
news
anna
as
soon
as
you
gone
out
father
told
me
that
mynors
was
coming
for
supper
did
you
know
before
till
mynors
told
me
dear
it
was
characteristic
of
her
father
to
say
nothing
until
the
last
moment
and
he
told
me
to
put
an
extra
plate
and
i
asked
him
if
i
had
better
put
the
beef
on
the
table
and
first
he
said
no
cross
you
know
and
then
he
said
i
could
please
myself
so
i
put
it
on
why
has
mynors
come
anna
should
i
know
some
business
between
him
and
father
i
expect
very
said
agnes
positively
with
the
child
aptitude
for
looking
a
fact
squarely
in
the
face
queer
know
it
is
anna
she
frowned
and
then
breaking
into
a
joyous
anile
is
he
nice
i
think
he
lovely
anna
assented
coldly
really
agnes
persisted
anna
brushed
her
hair
and
determined
not
to
put
on
the
apron
which
she
usually
wore
in
the
house
i
tidy
anna
run
downstairs
now
i
am
coming
directly
want
to
wait
for
you
agnes
pouted
well
dear
they
entered
the
parlour
together
and
henry
mynors
jumped
up
from
his
chair
and
would
not
sit
at
table
until
they
were
seated
then
tellwright
carved
the
beef
giving
each
of
them
a
very
small
piece
and
taking
only
cheese
for
himself
agnes
handed
the
and
the
bread
mynors
talked
about
nothing
in
especial
but
he
talked
and
laughed
the
whole
time
he
even
made
the
old
man
laugh
by
a
comical
phrase
aimed
at
agnes
mad
passion
for
he
seemed
not
to
have
detected
any
shortcomings
in
the
table
appointments
the
coarse
cloth
and
plates
the
chipped
tumblers
the
pewter
cruet
and
the
stumpy
knives
which
caused
anguish
in
the
heart
of
the
housewife
he
might
have
sat
at
such
a
table
every
night
of
his
life
i
trouble
you
for
a
little
more
beef
he
asked
presently
and
anna
fancied
a
shade
of
mischief
in
his
tone
as
he
thus
forced
the
old
man
into
a
tardy
hospitality
a
morsel
of
fat
she
wondered
whether
he
guessed
that
she
was
worth
fifty
thousand
pounds
and
her
father
worth
perhaps
more
but
on
the
whole
anna
enjoyed
the
meal
she
was
sorry
when
they
had
finished
and
agnes
had
thanked
god
for
the
beef
it
was
not
without
considerable
reluctance
that
she
rose
and
left
the
side
of
the
man
whose
arm
she
could
have
touched
at
any
time
during
the
previous
twenty
minutes
she
had
felt
happy
and
perturbed
in
being
so
near
to
him
so
intimate
and
free
already
she
knew
his
face
by
heart
the
two
girls
carried
the
plates
and
dishes
into
the
kitchen
agnes
making
the
last
journey
with
the
tablecloth
which
mynors
had
assisted
her
to
fold
the
door
agnes
said
the
old
man
getting
up
to
light
the
gas
it
was
an
order
of
dismissal
to
both
his
daughters
me
light
that
mynors
exclaimed
and
the
gas
was
lighted
before
tellwright
had
struck
a
match
mynors
turned
on
the
full
force
of
gas
then
tellwright
carefully
lowered
it
the
summer
quarter
at
that
house
did
not
exceed
five
shillings
through
the
open
windows
of
the
kitchen
and
parlour
anna
could
hear
the
voices
of
the
two
men
in
conversation
mynors
vivacious
and
changeful
her
father
monotonous
curt
and
heavy
once
she
caught
the
old
man
hard
dry
chuckle
the
was
done
agnes
had
accomplished
her
the
grandfather
clock
chimed
the
after
nine
must
go
to
bed
agnes
i
say
to
him
i
will
say
for
you
forget
to
i
shall
ask
you
in
the
morning
the
regular
sound
of
talk
still
came
from
the
parlour
a
full
moon
passed
along
the
cloudless
sky
by
its
light
and
that
of
a
glimmer
of
gas
anna
sat
cleaning
silver
or
rather
nickel
at
the
kitchen
table
the
spoons
and
forks
were
already
clean
but
she
felt
compelled
to
busy
herself
with
something
at
length
the
talk
stopped
and
she
heard
the
scraping
of
should
she
return
to
the
parlour
or
should
she
even
while
she
hesitated
the
kitchen
door
opened
me
coming
in
here
said
mynors
wanted
to
say
to
you
she
sprang
up
and
he
took
her
hand
could
he
feel
the
agitation
of
that
hand
he
said
it
again
agnes
wished
me
to
say
to
you
for
her
she
he
smiled
till
then
his
face
had
been
serious
forget
friday
if
i
could
she
murmured
after
he
had
gone
chapter
v
the
revival
anna
spent
the
two
following
afternoons
in
visiting
the
houses
of
her
she
had
no
talent
for
such
work
which
demands
the
vocal
rather
than
the
meditative
temperament
and
the
apparent
futility
of
her
labours
would
have
disgusted
and
disheartened
her
had
she
not
been
sustained
and
urged
forward
by
the
still
active
influence
of
mynors
and
the
teachers
meeting
there
were
fifteen
names
in
her
and
she
went
to
each
house
except
four
whose
tenants
were
impeccable
wesleyan
families
and
would
have
considered
themselves
insulted
by
a
visit
from
an
upstart
like
anna
of
the
eleven
some
parents
were
rude
to
her
others
begged
and
she
had
nothing
to
give
others
made
perfunctory
promises
only
two
seemed
to
regard
her
as
anything
but
a
somewhat
tiresome
impertinence
the
fault
was
doubtless
her
own
nevertheless
she
found
joy
in
the
uncongenial
and
task
the
cold
fierce
joy
of
the
nun
in
her
penance
when
it
was
done
she
said
have
done
it
as
one
who
has
sworn
to
do
it
come
what
might
yet
without
quite
expecting
to
succeed
on
the
friday
afternoon
during
tea
a
boy
brought
up
a
large
foolscap
packet
addressed
to
tellwright
mynors
the
boy
said
tellwright
opened
it
leisurely
after
the
boy
had
gone
and
took
out
some
sheets
covered
with
figures
which
he
carefully
examined
he
said
as
she
was
clearing
away
the
tea
things
understand
going
to
the
revival
meeting
i
shall
have
a
message
as
thou
mun
give
to
mr
mynors
when
she
went
upstairs
to
dress
she
saw
the
suttons
landau
standing
outside
their
house
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
sutton
came
down
the
front
steps
and
got
into
the
carriage
and
was
followed
by
a
little
restless
nervous
alert
man
who
carried
in
his
hand
a
black
case
of
peculiar
form
revivalist
anna
exclaimed
remembering
that
he
was
to
stay
with
the
suttons
during
the
revival
week
then
this
was
the
renowned
crusader
and
the
case
held
his
renowned
cornet
the
carriage
drove
off
down
trafalgar
road
and
anna
could
see
that
the
little
man
was
talking
vehemently
and
incessantly
to
sutton
who
listened
with
evident
interest
at
the
same
time
the
man
eyes
were
everywhere
absorbing
all
details
of
the
street
and
houses
with
unquenchable
curiosity
is
the
message
for
mynors
father
she
asked
in
the
parlour
putting
on
her
cotton
gloves
he
said
and
then
paused

door
lass
she
shut
it
not
knowing
what
this
cautiousness
foreshadowed
agnes

in
the
kitchen

couple
o
thousand
pounds
and
he

he
give

third
share
in
his
concern
for
two
thousand
pound
now
i
looked
into
it
and
there
money

it

and
he
gotten
hold
of
a
good
thing
he
sent

father
that

she

i

all
right
he
remarked
sharply
mun

mynors
as
i
say
it
satisfactory
tell

that
see
i
say
it
satisfactory
i
shall
want
for
to
see
him
later
on
he
told
me
he
couldna
come
up
any
night
next
week
so
ask
him
to
make
it
the
week
after
there
no
hurry
dunna
forget
what
surprised
anna
most
in
the
affair
was
that
henry
mynors
should
have
been
able
to
tempt
her
father
into
a
speculation
ephraim
tellwright
the
investor
was
usually
as
shy
as
a
trout
and
this
capture
of
him
by
a
youngster
only
two
years
established
in
business
might
fairly
be
regarded
as
a
prodigious
feat
it
was
indeed
the
highest
distinction
of
mynors
commercial
career
henry
was
so
prominently
active
in
the
wesleyan
society
that
the
members
of
that
society
especially
the
women
were
apt
to
ignore
the
other
side
of
his
individuality
they
knew
him
supreme
as
a
religious
worker
they
did
not
realise
the
likelihood
of
his
becoming
supreme
in
the
staple
manufacture
left
an
orphan
at
seventeen
mynors
belonged
to
a
family
now
otherwise
extinct
in
the
five
towns
one
of
those
families
which
by
virtue
of
numbers
variety
and
personal
force
seem
to
permeate
a
whole
district
to
be
a
calculable
item
of
it
an
essential
part
of
its
identity
the
elders
of
the
mynors
blood
had
once
occupied
the
red
house
opposite
tellwright
now
used
as
a
school
and
had
there
reared
many
children
the
school
building
was
still
known
as
by
people
then
the
parents
died
in
middle
age
one
daughter
married
in
the
north
another
in
the
south
a
third
went
to
china
as
a
missionary
and
died
of
fever
the
eldest
son
died
the
second
had
vanished
into
canada
and
was
reported
a
scapegrace
the
third
was
a
henry
the
youngest
alone
was
left
and
of
all
the
family
henry
was
the
only
one
to
be
connected
with
the
earthenware
trade
there
was
no
inherited
money
and
during
ten
years
he
had
worked
for
a
large
firm
in
turnhill
as
clerk
as
traveller
and
last
as
manager
living
always
quietly
in
lodgings
in
the
fullness
of
time
he
gave
notice
to
leave
was
offered
a
partnership
and
refused
it
taking
a
newly
erected
manufactory
in
bursley
near
the
canal
he
started
in
business
for
himself
and
it
became
known
that
at
the
age
of
he
had
saved
fifteen
hundred
pounds
equally
expert
in
the
labyrinths
of
manufacture
and
in
the
niceties
of
the
markets
he
was
reckoned
a
peerless
traveller
mynors
inevitably
flourished
his
were
filled
and
flowing
over
at
remunerative
prices
and
insufficiency
of
capital
was
the
sole
peril
to
which
he
was
exposed
by
the
raising
of
a
finger
he
could
have
had
a
dozen
working
and
moneyed
partners
but
he
had
no
desire
for
a
working
partner
what
he
wanted
was
a
capitalist
who
had
confidence
in
him
mynors
in
ephraim
tellwright
he
found
the
man
whether
it
was
by
instinct
good
luck
or
skilful
diplomacy
that
mynors
secured
this
invaluable
prize
no
one
could
positively
say
and
perhaps
even
he
himself
could
not
have
catalogued
all
the
obscure
motives
that
had
guided
him
to
the
shrewd
miser
of
manor
terrace
anna
had
meant
to
reach
chapel
before
the
commencement
of
the
meeting
but
the
interview
with
her
father
threw
her
late
as
she
entered
the
porch
an
officer
told
her
that
the
body
of
the
chapel
was
quite
full
and
that
she
should
go
into
the
gallery
where
a
few
seats
were
left
near
the
choir
she
obeyed
had
no
rights
at
that
service
the
scene
in
the
auditorium
astonished
her
effectually
putting
an
end
to
the
worldly
preoccupation
caused
by
her
father
news
the
historic
chapel
was
crowded
almost
in
every
part
and
the
congregation
impressed
excited
eager
sang
the
opening
hymn
with
unprecedented
vigour
and
sincerity
above
the
rest
could
be
heard
the
trained
voices
of
a
large
choir
and
even
the
choir
usually
perfunctory
seemed
to
share
the
general
fervour
in
the
vast
mahogany
pulpit
the
reverend
reginald
banks
the
superintendent
minister
a
stout
man
with
pendent
cheeks
and
cold
grey
eyes
stood
impassively
regarding
the
assemblage
and
by
his
side
was
the
revivalist
a
manikin
in
comparison
with
his
colleague
on
the
broad
balustrade
of
the
pulpit
lay
the
cornet
the
fiery
and
inquisitive
eyes
of
the
revivalist
probed
into
the
furthest
corners
of
the
chapel
apparently
no
detail
of
any
single
face
or
of
the
florid
decoration
escaped
him
and
as
anna
crept
into
a
small
empty
pew
next
to
the
east
wall
she
felt
that
she
too
had
been
separately
observed
banks
gave
out
the
last
verse
of
the
hymn
and
simultaneously
with
the
leading
chord
from
the
organ
the
revivalist
seized
his
cornet
and
joined
the
melody
massive
yet
exultant
the
tones
rose
clear
over
the
mighty
volume
of
vocal
sound
an
incitement
to
victorious
effort
the
effect
was
instant
an
ecstatic
tremor
seemed
to
pass
through
the
congregation
like
wind
through
ripe
corn
and
at
the
close
of
the
hymn
it
was
not
until
the
revivalist
had
put
down
his
cornet
that
the
people
resumed
their
seats
amid
the
of
dresses
and
subdued
clearing
of
throats
banks
retired
softly
to
the
back
of
the
pulpit
and
the
revivalist
mounting
a
stool
suddenly
dominated
the
congregation
his
glance
swept
masterfully
across
the
chapel
and
round
the
gallery
he
raised
one
hand
with
the
stilling
action
of
a
mesmerist
and
the
people
either
kneeling
or
inclined
against
the
front
of
the
pews
hid
their
faces
from
those
eyes
it
was
as
though
the
man
had
in
a
moment
measured
their
iniquities
and
had
courageously
resolved
to
intercede
for
them
with
god
but
was
not
very
sanguine
as
to
the
result
everyone
except
the
organist
who
was
searching
his
for
the
next
tune
seemed
to
feel
humbled
bitterly
ashamed
as
it
were
caught
in
the
act
of
sin
there
was
a
solemn
and
terrible
pause
then
the
revivalist
began
us
o
dread
god
suppliants
for
thy
mercy
his
voice
was
rich
and
full
but
at
the
same
time
sharp
and
decisive
the
burning
eyes
were
shut
tight
and
anna
who
had
a
profile
view
of
his
face
saw
that
every
muscle
of
it
was
drawn
tense
the
man
possessed
an
extraordinary
histrionic
gift
and
he
used
it
with
imagination
he
had
two
audiences
god
and
the
congregation
god
was
not
more
distant
from
him
than
the
congregation
or
less
real
to
him
or
less
a
heart
to
be
influenced
declamatory
and
full
of
effects
carefully
calculated
a
work
of
art
in
fact
his
appeal
showed
no
error
of
discretion
in
its
approach
to
the
eternal
there
was
no
minimising
of
committed
sin
nor
yet
an
insincere
and
grovelling
a
tyrant
could
not
have
taken
offence
at
its
tone
which
seemed
to
pacify
god
while
rendering
the
human
audience
still
more
contrite
the
conclusion
of
the
catalogue
of
wickedness
and
swift
confident
turn
to
christ
cross
was
marvellously
impressive
the
congregation
burst
out
into
sighs
groans
blessings
and
amens
and
the
pillars
of
distant
rural
conventicles
who
had
travelled
from
the
confines
of
the
circuit
to
its
centre
in
order
to
partake
of
this
spiritual
excitation
began
to
feel
that
they
would
not
be
disappointed
the
holy
ghost
descend
upon
us
now
the
revivalist
pleaded
with
restrained
passion
and
then
opening
his
eyes
and
looking
at
the
clock
in
front
of
the
gallery
he
repeated
now
at
minutes
past
seven
then
his
eyes
without
shifting
seemed
to
ignore
the
clock
to
gaze
through
it
into
some
unworldly
dimension
and
he
murmured
in
a
soft
dramatic
whisper
see
the
divine
dove
the
doors
closed
during
prayer
were
opened
and
more
people
entered
a
youth
came
into
anna
pew
the
superintendent
minister
gave
out
another
hymn
and
when
this
was
finished
the
revivalist
who
had
been
resting
in
a
chair
came
forward
again
and
he
said
lot
of
you
fools
that
you
are
have
come
here
to
hear
me
play
my
cornet
well
you
have
heard
me
i
have
played
the
cornet
and
i
will
play
it
again
i
would
play
it
on
my
head
if
by
so
doing
i
could
bring
sinners
to
christ
i
have
been
called
a
mountebank
i
am
one
i
glory
in
it
i
am
god
mountebank
doing
god
precious
business
in
my
own
way
but
god
precious
business
can
not
be
carried
on
even
by
a
mountebank
without
money
and
there
will
be
a
collection
towards
the
expenses
of
the
revival
during
the
collection
we
will
sing
rock
of
ages
and
you
shall
hear
my
cornet
again
if
you
feel
willing
to
give
us
your
sixpences
give
but
if
you
resent
a
collection
here
he
adopted
a
tone
of
ferocious
sarcasm
your
miserable
sixpences
and
get
of
miserable
enjoyment
out
of
them
elsewhere
as
the
meeting
proceeded
submitting
itself
more
and
more
to
the
imperious
hypnotism
of
the
revivalist
anna
gradually
became
oppressed
by
a
vague
sensation
which
was
partly
sorrow
and
partly
an
inexplicable
dull
anger
anger
at
her
own
penitence
she
felt
as
if
everything
was
wrong
and
could
never
by
any
possibility
be
righted
after
two
exhortations
from
the
minister
and
the
revivalist
and
another
hymn
the
revivalist
once
more
prayed
and
as
he
did
so
anna
looked
stealthily
about
in
a
sick
preoccupied
way
the
youth
at
her
side
stared
glumly
in
front
of
him
in
the
orchestra
henry
mynors
was
whispering
to
the
organist
down
in
the
body
of
the
chapel
the
atmosphere
was
electric
perilous
overcharged
with
spiritual
emotion
she
was
glad
she
was
not
down
there
the
voice
of
the
revivalist
ceased
but
he
kept
the
attitude
of
supplication
sobs
were
heard
in
various
quarters
and
here
and
there
an
elder
of
the
chapel
could
be
seen
talking
quietly
to
some
convicted
sinner
the
revivalist
began
softly
to
sing
lover
of
my
soul
and
most
of
the
congregation
standing
up
joined
him
but
the
sinners
stricken
of
the
spirit
remained
abjectly
bent
tortured
by
conscience
pulled
this
way
by
christ
and
that
by
satan
a
few
rose
and
went
to
the
communion
rails
there
to
kneel
in
the
sight
of
all
banks
descended
from
the
pulpit
and
opening
the
wicket
which
led
to
the
communion
table
spoke
to
these
over
the
rails
reassuringly
as
a
nurse
to
a
child
other
sinners
desirous
of
fuller
and
more
intimate
guidance
passed
down
the
aisles
and
so
into
the
preacher
vestry
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
chapel
and
were
followed
thither
by
and
other
proved
servants
of
god
among
these
last
were
titus
price
and
sutton
blood
of
christ
atones
said
the
revivalist
solemnly
at
the
end
of
the
hymn
spirit
of
christ
is
working
among
us
let
us
engage
in
private
prayer
let
us
drive
the
devil
out
of
this
chapel
more
sighs
and
groans
followed
then
someone
cried
out
in
sharp
shrill
tones
him
and
another
cried
him
and
an
old
woman
quavering
voice
sang
the
words
know
that
my
redeemer
liveth
anna
was
in
despair
at
her
own
predicament
and
the
sense
of
sin
was
not
more
strong
than
the
sense
of
being
confused
and
publicly
shamed
a
man
opened
the
and
sitting
down
by
the
side
began
to
talk
with
him
it
was
henry
mynors
anna
looked
steadily
away
at
the
wall
fearful
lest
he
should
address
her
too
presently
the
youth
got
up
with
a
frenzied
gesture
and
walked
out
of
the
gallery
followed
by
mynors
in
a
moment
she
saw
the
youth
stepping
awkwardly
along
the
aisle
beneath
towards
the
inquiry
room
his
head
forward
and
the
lower
lip
hanging
as
though
he
were
sulky
anna
was
now
in
the
profoundest
misery
the
weight
of
her
sins
of
her
ingratitude
to
god
lay
on
her
like
a
physical
and
intolerable
load
and
she
lost
all
feeling
of
shame
as
a
voyager
loses
shame
after
an
hour
of
nausea
she
knew
then
that
she
could
no
longer
go
on
living
as
aforetime
she
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
her
tremendous
responsibility
to
agnes
agnes
who
took
her
for
perfection
she
recollected
all
her
sins
individually
lies
sloth
envy
vanity
even
theft
in
her
infancy
she
heaped
up
all
the
wickedness
of
a
lifetime
hysterically
augmented
it
and
found
a
horrid
pleasure
in
the
exaggeration
her
virtuous
acts
shrank
into
nothingness
a
man
and
then
another
emerged
from
the
vestry
door
with
beaming
happy
face
these
were
saved
they
had
yielded
to
christ
persuasive
invitation
anna
tried
to
imagine
herself
converted
or
in
the
process
of
being
converted
she
could
not
she
could
only
sit
moveless
dull
and
abject
she
did
not
stir
even
when
the
congregation
rose
for
another
hymn
in
what
did
conversion
consist
was
it
to
say
the
words
believe
she
repeated
to
herself
softly
believe
i
believe
but
nothing
happened
of
course
she
believed
she
had
never
doubted
or
dreamed
of
doubting
that
jesus
died
on
the
cross
to
save
her
soul
soul
from
eternal
damnation
she
was
probably
unaware
that
any
person
in
christendom
had
doubted
that
fact
so
fundamental
to
her
what
then
was
lacking
what
was
belief
what
was
faith
a
venerable
came
from
the
vestry
and
slowly
climbing
the
pulpit
stairs
whispered
in
the
ear
of
the
revivalist
the
latter
faced
the
congregation
with
a
cry
of
joy
he
exclaimed
bless
thee
that
seventeen
souls
have
found
thee
lord
let
the
full
crop
be
gathered
for
the
fields
are
white
unto
harvest
there
was
an
exuberant
chorus
of
praise
to
god
the
door
of
the
pew
was
opened
gently
and
anna
started
to
see
sutton
at
her
side
she
at
once
guessed
that
mynors
had
sent
to
her
this
angel
of
consolation
you
near
the
light
dear
anna
sutton
began
anna
searched
for
an
answer
she
now
sat
huddled
up
in
the
corner
of
the
pew
her
face
partially
turned
towards
sutton
who
looked
mildly
into
her
eyes
do
know
anna
stammered
feeling
like
a
naughty
a
doubt
whether
the
whole
affair
was
not
after
all
absurd
flashed
through
her
and
was
gone
it
is
quite
simple
said
sutton
can
not
tell
you
anything
that
you
do
not
know
cast
out
pride
cast
out
pride
that
is
it
nothing
but
earthly
pride
prevents
you
from
realising
the
saving
power
of
christ
you
are
afraid
anna
afraid
to
be
humble
be
brave
it
is
so
simple
so
easy
if
one
will
but
submit
anna
said
nothing
had
nothing
to
say
was
conscious
of
nothing
save
excessive
discomfort
do
you
feel
your
difficulty
to
be
asked
sutton
do
know
she
answered
wearily
happiness
that
awaits
you
is
unspeakable
i
have
followed
christ
for
nearly
fifty
years
and
my
happiness
increases
daily
sometimes
i
do
not
know
how
to
contain
it
all
it
surges
above
all
the
trials
and
disappointments
of
this
world
oh
anna
if
you
will
but
believe
the
ageing
woman
thin
distinguished
face
crowned
with
abundant
grey
hair
glistened
with
love
and
compassion
and
as
anna
eyes
rested
upon
it
anna
felt
that
here
was
something
tangible
something
to
lay
hold
on
think
i
do
believe
she
said
weakly
think
are
you
sure
are
you
not
deceiving
yourself
belief
is
not
with
the
lips
it
is
with
the
heart
there
was
a
pause
banks
could
be
heard
praying
will
go
home
anna
whispered
at
length
think
it
out
for
myself
my
dear
girl
and
god
will
help
you
sutton
bent
and
kissed
anna
affectionately
and
then
hurried
away
to
offer
her
ministrations
elsewhere
as
anna
left
the
chapel
she
encountered
the
pacing
regularly
to
and
fro
across
the
length
of
the
broad
steps
in
the
porch
was
a
notice
that
cabinet
photographs
of
the
revivalist
could
be
purchased
on
application
at
one
shilling
each
chapter
vi
willie
anna
closed
the
bedroom
door
softly
through
the
open
window
came
the
tones
of
cauldon
church
clock
famous
for
their
sonority
and
richness
announcing
eleven
agnes
lay
asleep
under
the
counterpane
on
the
side
of
the
bed
next
the
wall
the
pushed
down
and
disclosing
the
upper
half
of
her
figure
she
slept
in
absolute
repose
with
flushed
cheek
and
every
muscle
lax
her
hair
by
some
chance
drawn
in
a
perfect
straight
line
diagonally
across
the
pillow
anna
glanced
at
her
sister
the
image
of
physical
innocence
and
childish
security
and
then
depositing
the
candle
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
the
bedroom
was
over
the
kitchen
and
faced
south
the
moon
was
hidden
by
clouds
but
clear
stretches
of
sky
showed
clusters
of
stars
brightly
winking
to
the
far
right
across
the
fields
the
silhouette
of
hillport
church
could
just
be
discerned
on
the
ridge
in
front
several
miles
away
the
of
cauldon
bar
ironworks
shot
up
vast
wreaths
of
yellow
flame
with
canopies
of
tinted
smoke
still
more
distant
were
a
thousand
other
lights
crowning
chimney
and
kiln
and
nearer
on
the
waste
lands
west
of
bleakridge
long
fields
of
burning
ironstone
glowed
with
all
the
strange
colours
of
decadence
the
entire
landscape
was
illuminated
and
transformed
by
these
unique
pyrotechnics
of
labour
atoning
for
its
grime
and
dull
weird
sounds
as
of
the
breathings
and
sighings
of
gigantic
nocturnal
creatures
filled
the
enchanted
air
it
was
a
romantic
scene
a
romantic
summer
night
balmy
delicate
and
wrapped
in
meditation
but
anna
saw
nothing
there
save
the
repulsive
evidences
of
manufacture
had
never
seen
anything
else
she
was
still
horribly
acutely
miserable
exhausted
by
the
fruitless
search
for
some
solution
of
the
enigma
of
sin
her
sin
in
particular
and
of
redemption
she
had
cogitated
in
a
vain
circle
until
she
was
no
longer
capable
of
reasoned
ideas
she
gazed
at
the
stars
and
into
the
illimitable
spaces
beyond
them
and
thought
of
life
and
its
inconceivable
littleness
as
millions
had
done
before
in
the
presence
of
that
same
firmament
then
after
a
time
her
brain
resumed
its
task
she
began
to
probe
herself
anew
would
it
have
availed
if
she
had
walked
publicly
to
the
penitential
form
at
the
communion
rail
and
ranging
herself
with
the
working
men
and
women
proved
by
that
overt
deed
the
sincerity
of
her
contrition
she
wished
ardently
that
she
had
done
so
yet
knew
well
that
such
an
act
would
always
be
impossible
for
her
even
though
the
evasion
of
it
meant
eternal
torture
undoubtedly
as
sutton
had
implied
she
was
proud
obstinate
in
iniquity
agnes
stirred
slightly
in
her
sleep
and
anna
aroused
dropped
the
blind
turned
towards
the
room
and
began
to
undress
slowly
with
reflective
pauses
her
melancholy
became
grim
sardonic
if
she
was
doomed
to
destruction
so
let
it
be
suddenly
she
knelt
down
and
prayed
prayed
that
pride
might
be
cast
out
burying
her
face
in
the
coverlet
and
caging
the
passionate
effusion
in
a
whisper
lest
agnes
should
be
disturbed
having
prayed
she
still
knelt
quiescent
her
eyes
were
dry
and
burning
the
last
car
thundered
up
the
road
shaking
the
house
and
she
rose
finished
undressing
blew
out
the
candle
and
slipped
into
bed
by
agnes
side
she
could
not
sleep
did
not
attempt
to
sleep
but
abandoned
herself
meekly
to
despair
her
thoughts
covered
again
the
interminable
round
and
again
and
yet
again
in
the
twilight
of
the
brief
summer
night
her
accustomed
eyes
could
distinguish
every
object
in
the
room
all
the
bits
of
furniture
which
had
been
bought
from
hanbridge
and
with
which
she
had
been
familiar
since
her
memory
began
everything
appeared
mean
despicable
cheerless
there
was
nothing
to
inspire
she
dreamed
impossibly
of
a
high
spirituality
which
should
metamorphose
all
change
her
life
lend
glamour
to
the
most
pitiful
surroundings
ennoble
the
most
ignominious
burdens
a
spirituality
never
to
be
hers
at
any
rate
she
would
tell
her
father
in
the
morning
that
she
was
convicted
of
sin
and
however
hopelessly
seeking
salvation
she
would
tell
both
her
father
and
agnes
at
breakfast
the
task
would
be
difficult
but
she
swore
to
do
it
she
resolved
she
endeavoured
to
sleep
and
did
sleep
uneasily
for
a
short
period
when
she
woke
the
great
business
of
the
dawn
had
begun
she
left
the
bed
and
drawing
up
the
blind
looked
forth
the
furnace
fires
were
paling
a
few
milky
clouds
sailed
in
the
vast
pallid
blue
it
was
cool
just
then
and
she
shivered
she
went
to
the
glass
and
examined
her
face
carefully
but
it
gave
no
signs
whatever
of
the
inward
warfare
she
saw
her
plain
and
mended
suppose
she
were
married
to
mynors
suppose
he
lay
asleep
in
the
bed
where
agnes
lay
asleep
involuntarily
she
glanced
at
agnes
to
certify
that
the
child
and
none
else
was
indeed
there
and
got
into
bed
hurriedly
and
hid
herself
because
she
was
ashamed
to
have
had
such
a
fancy
but
she
continued
to
think
of
mynors
she
envied
him
for
his
cheerfulness
his
joy
his
goodness
his
dignity
his
tact
his
sex
she
envied
every
man
even
in
the
sphere
of
religion
men
were
not
fettered
like
women
no
man
she
thought
would
acquiesce
in
the
futility
to
which
she
was
already
half
resigned
a
man
would
either
wring
salvation
from
the
heavenly
powers
or
race
gloriously
to
hell
mynors
mynors
was
a
god
she
recollected
her
resolution
to
speak
to
her
father
and
agnes
at
breakfast
and
shudderingly
confirmed
it
but
less
stoutly
than
before
then
an
announcement
made
by
banks
in
chapel
on
the
previous
evening
presented
itself
as
though
she
was
listening
to
it
for
the
first
time
it
was
the
announcement
of
a
for
workers
in
the
revival
to
be
held
that
saturday
morning
at
seven
she
instantly
decided
to
go
to
the
meeting
and
the
decision
seemed
to
give
her
new
hope
perhaps
there
she
might
find
peace
on
that
faint
expectancy
she
fell
asleep
again
and
did
not
wake
till
six
after
her
usual
hour
she
heard
noises
in
the
yard
it
was
her
father
going
towards
the
garden
with
a
wheelbarrow
she
dressed
quickly
and
when
she
had
pinned
on
her
hat
she
woke
agnes
out
sis
the
child
asked
sleepily
seeing
her
attire
dear
i
am
going
to
the
seven
and
you
must
get
breakfast
you
can
ca
you
the
child
assented
glad
of
the
chance
what
are
you
going
to
the
for
anna
hesitated
why
not
confess
no
must
go
she
said
quietly
at
length
shall
be
back
before
eight
father
know
agnes
enquired
apprehensively
dear
anna
shut
the
door
quickly
went
softly
downstairs
and
along
the
passage
and
crept
into
the
street
like
a
thief
men
and
women
and
boys
and
girls
were
on
their
way
to
work
with
hurried
clattering
steps
some
munching
thick
pieces
of
bread
as
they
went
all
apparently
morose
and
not
quite
awake
the
dust
lay
thick
in
the
arid
gutters
and
in
drifts
across
the
pavement
as
the
had
blown
it
vehicular
traffic
had
not
begun
and
blinds
were
still
drawn
and
though
the
footpaths
were
busy
the
street
had
a
deserted
and
forlorn
aspect
anna
walked
hastily
down
the
road
avoiding
the
glances
of
such
as
looked
at
her
but
peering
furtively
at
the
faces
of
those
who
ignored
her
all
seemed
callous
hoggishly
careless
of
the
everlasting
verities
at
first
it
appeared
strange
to
her
that
the
potent
revival
in
the
wesleyan
chapel
had
produced
no
effect
on
these
preoccupied
people
bursley
then
continued
its
dull
and
even
course
she
wondered
whether
any
of
them
guessed
that
she
was
going
to
the
and
secretly
sneered
at
her
therefore
when
she
had
climbed
duck
bank
she
found
to
her
surprise
that
the
doors
of
the
chapel
were
fast
closed
though
it
was
ten
minutes
past
seven
was
there
to
be
no
a
momentary
sensation
of
relief
flashed
through
her
and
then
she
saw
that
the
gate
of
the
was
open
she
should
have
known
that
early
morning
prayers
were
never
offered
up
in
the
chapel
but
in
the
she
crossed
the
quadrangle
with
beating
heart
feeling
now
that
she
had
embarked
on
a
frightful
enterprise
the
door
of
the
was
ajar
she
pushed
it
and
went
in
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
a
meagre
handful
of
worshippers
were
collected
and
on
the
raised
platform
stood
banks
vapid
perfunctory
and
fatigued
he
gave
out
a
verse
and
pitched
the
tune
too
high
but
the
singers
with
a
heroic
effect
accomplished
the
verse
without
breaking
down
the
singing
was
thin
and
feeble
and
the
eagerness
of
one
or
two
voices
seemed
strained
as
though
with
a
determination
to
make
the
best
of
things
mynors
was
not
present
and
anna
did
not
know
whether
to
be
sorry
or
glad
at
this
she
recognised
that
save
herself
all
present
were
old
believers
tried
warriors
of
the
lord
there
was
only
one
other
woman
miss
sarah
vodrey
an
aged
spinster
who
kept
house
for
titus
price
and
his
son
and
found
her
sole
diversion
in
the
variety
of
her
religious
experiences
before
the
hymn
was
finished
a
young
man
joined
the
assembly
it
was
the
youth
who
had
sat
near
anna
on
the
previous
night
an
ecstatic
and
naïve
bliss
shone
from
his
face
in
his
prayer
the
minister
drew
the
attention
of
the
deity
to
the
fact
that
although
a
score
or
more
of
souls
had
been
ingathered
at
the
first
service
the
methodists
of
bursley
were
by
no
means
satisfied
they
wanted
more
they
wanted
the
whole
of
bursley
and
they
would
be
content
with
no
less
he
begged
that
their
earnest
work
might
not
be
shamed
before
the
world
by
a
partial
success
in
conclusion
he
sought
the
blessing
of
god
on
the
revivalist
and
asked
that
this
tireless
enthusiast
might
be
led
to
husband
his
strength
at
which
there
was
a
fervent
amen
several
men
prayed
and
a
pause
ensued
all
still
kneeling
then
the
minister
said
in
a
tone
of
oily
politeness
a
sister
pray
another
pause
followed
tellwright
anna
would
have
welcomed
death
and
damnation
she
clasped
her
hands
tightly
and
longed
for
the
endless
moment
to
pass
at
last
sarah
vodrey
gave
a
preliminary
cough
miss
vodrey
was
always
happy
to
pray
aloud
and
her
invocations
usually
began
with
the
same
phrase
we
thank
thee
that
this
day
finds
us
with
our
bodies
out
of
the
grave
and
our
souls
out
of
hell
afterwards
the
minister
gave
out
another
hymn
and
as
soon
as
the
singing
commenced
anna
slipped
away
once
in
the
yard
she
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
peace
at
the
it
was
like
coming
out
of
prison
peace
was
farther
off
than
ever
nay
she
had
actually
forgotten
her
soul
in
the
sensations
of
shame
and
discomfort
she
had
contrived
only
to
make
herself
ridiculous
and
perhaps
the
pious
at
their
would
discuss
her
and
her
father
and
their
money
and
the
queer
life
they
led
if
mynors
had
but
been
present
she
walked
out
into
the
street
it
was
twenty
minutes
to
eight
by
the
clock
the
last
workmen
car
of
the
morning
was
just
leaving
bursley
it
was
packed
inside
and
outside
and
the
conductor
hung
insecurely
on
the
step
at
the
gates
of
the
manufactory
opposite
the
chapel
a
man
in
a
white
smock
stood
placidly
smoking
a
pipe
a
was
a
little
thing
a
trifle
in
the
immense
and
regular
activity
of
the
town
this
thought
necessarily
occurred
to
anna
she
hurried
homewards
wondering
what
her
father
would
say
about
that
morning
unusual
excursion
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
distant
from
home
she
saw
to
her
astonishment
agnes
emerging
from
the
of
the
house
the
child
ran
rapidly
down
the
street
not
observing
anna
till
they
were
close
upon
each
other
anna
you
forgot
to
buy
the
bacon
yesterday
there
is
a
and
father
fearfully
angry
he
gave
me
sixpence
and
going
down
to
leal
to
get
some
as
quick
as
ever
i
can
it
was
a
thunderbolt
to
anna
this
seemingly
petty
misadventure
as
she
entered
the
house
she
felt
a
tear
on
her
cheek
she
was
ashamed
to
weep
but
she
wept
this
after
the
fiasco
of
the
was
a
climax
of
woe
it
overtopped
and
extinguished
all
the
rest
her
soul
was
nothing
to
her
now
she
quickly
took
off
her
hat
and
ran
to
the
kitchen
agnes
had
put
the
on
the
tray
ready
for
setting
the
bread
was
cut
the
coffee
portioned
into
the
jug
the
fire
burned
bright
and
the
kettle
sang
anna
took
the
cloth
from
the
drawer
in
the
oak
dresser
and
went
to
the
parlour
to
lay
the
table
tellwright
was
at
the
end
of
the
garden
pointing
the
wall
his
back
to
the
house
the
table
set
anna
observed
that
the
room
was
only
partly
dusted
there
was
a
duster
on
the
mantelpiece
she
seized
it
to
finish
and
at
that
moment
the
kitchen
clock
struck
eight
simultaneously
tellwright
dropped
his
trowel
and
came
towards
the
house
she
doggedly
dusted
one
chair
and
then
turning
coward
flew
away
upstairs
the
kitchen
was
barred
to
her
since
her
father
would
enter
by
the
kitchen
door
she
had
forgotten
to
buy
bacon
and
breakfast
would
be
late
it
was
a
calamity
unique
in
her
experience
she
stood
at
the
door
of
her
bedroom
and
waited
vehemently
for
agnes
return
at
last
the
child
raced
breathlessly
in
anna
flew
to
meet
her
with
incredible
speed
the
bacon
was
whipped
out
of
its
wrapper
and
anna
picked
up
the
knife
at
the
first
stroke
she
cut
herself
and
agnes
was
obliged
to
bind
the
finger
with
rag
the
clock
struck
the
like
a
knell
it
was
twenty
minutes
to
nine
forty
minutes
behind
time
when
the
two
girls
hurried
into
the
parlour
anna
bearing
the
bacon
and
hot
plates
agnes
the
bread
and
coffee
tellwright
sat
upright
and
ferocious
in
his
chair
the
image
of
offence
and
wrath
instead
of
reading
his
letters
he
had
fed
full
of
this
ineffable
grievance
the
meal
began
in
a
desolating
silence
the
male
creature
terrible
displeasure
permeated
the
whole
room
like
an
ether
invisible
but
carrying
vibrations
to
the
heart
then
when
he
had
eaten
one
piece
of
bacon
and
cut
his
envelopes
the
miser
began
to
empty
himself
of
some
of
his
anger
in
stormy
tones
that
might
have
uprooted
trees
anna
ought
to
feel
thoroughly
ashamed
he
could
not
imagine
what
she
had
been
thinking
of
why
did
she
tell
him
she
was
going
to
the
why
did
she
go
to
the
disarranging
the
whole
household
how
came
she
to
forget
the
bacon
it
was
gross
carelessness
a
pretty
example
to
her
little
sister
the
fact
was
that
her
she
had
gotten
above
hersen
she
was
careless
and
extravagant
look
how
thick
the
bacon
was
cut
he
should
not
stand
it
much
longer
and
her
finger
all
red
and
the
blood
dropping
on
the
cloth
a
nice
sight
at
a
meal
go
and
tie
it
up
again
without
a
word
she
left
the
room
to
obey
of
course
she
had
no
defence
agnes
her
tears
falling
pecked
her
food
timidly
like
a
bird
not
daring
to
stir
from
her
chair
even
to
assist
at
the
finger
did
mynors
say
tellwright
inquired
fiercely
when
anna
had
come
back
into
the
room
mynors
she
murmured
at
a
loss
but
vaguely
apprehending
further
trouble
ye
see
him
father
ye
give
him
my
message
forgot
it
god
in
heaven
she
had
forgotten
the
message
with
a
devastating
grunt
tellwright
walked
speechless
out
of
the
room
the
girls
cleared
the
table
exchanging
sympathy
with
a
single
mute
glance
anna
one
satisfaction
was
that
even
if
she
had
remembered
the
message
she
could
not
possibly
have
delivered
it
ephraim
tellwright
stayed
in
the
front
parlour
till
ten
unseen
but
felt
like
an
angry
god
behind
a
cloud
the
consciousness
that
he
was
there
unappeased
and
dangerous
remained
uppermost
in
the
minds
of
the
two
girls
during
the
morning
at
ten
he
opened
the
door
he
commanded
and
agnes
ran
to
him
from
the
kitchen
with
the
speed
of
propitiation
father
this
note
down
to
price
and
do
wait
for
an
answer
father
she
was
back
in
twenty
minutes
anna
was
sweeping
the
lobby
mynors
calls
while
i
out
you
mun
tell
him
to
wait
tellwright
said
to
agnes
pointedly
ignoring
anna
presence
then
having
brushed
his
greenish
hat
on
his
sleeve
he
went
off
towards
town
to
buy
meat
and
vegetables
he
always
did
saturday
marketing
himself
at
the
butcher
and
in
the
luke
covered
market
he
was
a
familiar
and
redoubtable
figure
among
the
salespeople
who
stood
the
market
was
a
wrinkled
hardy
old
from
the
other
side
of
moorthorne
every
saturday
the
miser
bested
her
in
their
and
nearly
every
saturday
she
scornfully
threw
at
him
the
same
joke
thee
along
to
th
master
terrick
happen
they
give
thee
o
stamps
for
fivepence
he
seldom
failed
to
laugh
heartily
at
this
at
dinner
the
girls
could
perceive
that
the
shadow
of
his
displeasure
had
slightly
lifted
though
he
kept
a
frowning
silence
expert
in
all
the
symptoms
of
his
moods
they
knew
that
in
a
few
hours
he
would
begin
to
talk
again
at
first
in
monosyllables
and
then
in
short
detached
sentences
an
intimation
of
relief
diffused
itself
through
the
house
like
a
hint
of
spring
in
february
these
domestic
upheavals
followed
always
the
same
course
and
anna
had
learnt
to
suffer
the
later
stages
of
them
with
calmness
and
even
with
impassivity
henry
mynors
had
not
called
she
supposed
that
her
father
had
expected
him
to
call
for
the
answer
which
she
had
forgotten
to
give
him
and
she
had
a
hope
that
he
would
come
in
the
afternoon
once
again
she
had
the
idea
that
something
definite
and
satisfactory
might
result
if
she
could
only
see
him
that
she
might
as
it
were
gather
inspiration
from
the
mere
sight
of
his
face
after
dinner
while
the
girls
were
washing
the
dinner
things
in
the
scullery
quick
ear
caught
the
sound
of
voices
in
the
parlour
they
listened
mynors
had
come
tellwright
must
have
seen
him
from
the
front
window
and
opened
the
door
to
him
before
he
could
ring
him
said
agnes
excited
anna
asked
mynors
of
course
said
the
child
sharply
making
it
quite
plain
that
this
affectation
could
not
impose
on
her
for
a
single
instant
it
was
tellwright
summons
through
the
parlour
window
she
dried
her
hands
doffed
her
apron
and
went
to
the
parlour
animated
by
a
thousand
fears
and
expectations
why
was
she
to
be
included
in
the
colloquy
mynors
rose
at
her
entrance
and
greeted
her
with
conspicuous
deference
a
deference
which
made
her
feel
ashamed
the
old
man
growled
but
he
was
obviously
content
gave
anna
a
message
for
ye
yesterday
mynors
but
her
forgot
to
deliver
it
ye
might
ha
been
saved
th
trouble
o
calling
now
as
ye
here
i
summat
for
tell
ye
it
be
anna
money
as
go
into
that
concern
o
yours
i
none
by
me
in
fact
i
fast
for
brass
but
her
have
as
near
two
thousand
as
makes
no
matter
in
a
month
time
and
her
says
her
go
in
wi
you
on
th
strength
my
recommendation
this
speech
was
evidently
a
perfect
surprise
for
henry
mynors
for
a
moment
he
seemed
to
be
at
a
loss
then
his
face
gave
candid
expression
to
a
feeling
of
intense
pleasure
know
all
about
this
business
then
miss
tellwright
she
blushed
has
told
me
something
about
it
are
you
willing
to
be
my
partner
i
did
na
say
that
tellwright
interrupted
be
money
but
i
my
name
see
said
mynors
gravely
if
it
is
miss
anna
money
why
should
not
she
be
the
partner
he
offered
one
of
his
courtly
diplomatic
smiles
but
anna
began
in
deprecation
tellwright
laughed
he
said
not
it
be
experience
for
th
lass
so
said
mynors
anna
stood
silent
like
a
child
who
is
being
talked
about
there
was
a
pause
you
care
for
that
arrangement
miss
tellwright
yes
she
said
shall
try
to
justify
your
confidence
i
need
say
that
i
think
you
and
your
father
will
have
no
reason
to
be
disappointed
two
thousand
pounds
is
of
course
only
a
trifle
to
you
but
it
is
a
great
deal
to
me
and
and
he
hesitated
anna
did
not
surmise
that
he
was
too
much
moved
by
the
sight
of
her
and
the
situation
to
continue
but
this
was
the
fact
nobbut
one
point
mynors
tellwright
said
bluntly
that
the
interest
on
th
capital
as
must
be
deducted
before
reckoning
profits
us
must
have
six
per
cent
i
thought
we
had
settled
it
at
five
said
mynors
with
sudden
firmness
settled
as
you
shall
have
five
on
your
fifteen
hundred
the
miser
replied
with
imperturbable
audacity
us
mun
have
our
six
certainly
thought
we
had
thrashed
that
out
fully
and
agreed
that
the
interest
should
be
the
same
on
each
side
mynors
was
alert
and
defensive
young
man
us
mun
have
our
six
we
takkin
a
risk
mynors
pressed
his
lips
together
he
was
taken
at
a
disadvantage
tellwright
with
unscrupulous
cleverness
had
utilized
the
effect
on
mynors
of
his
daughter
presence
to
regain
a
position
from
which
the
younger
man
had
definitely
ousted
him
a
few
days
before
mynors
was
annoyed
but
he
gave
no
sign
of
his
annoyance
well
he
said
at
length
with
a
private
smile
at
anna
to
indicate
that
it
was
out
of
regard
for
her
that
he
yielded
tellwright
made
no
pretence
of
concealing
his
satisfaction
he
too
smiled
at
anna
sardonically
the
last
vestige
of
the
irritation
vanished
in
a
glow
of
triumph
afraid
i
must
go
said
mynors
looking
at
his
watch
is
a
service
at
chapel
at
three
our
revivalist
came
down
with
sutton
to
look
over
the
works
this
morning
and
i
told
him
i
should
be
at
the
service
so
i
must
you
coming
mr
tellwright
my
lad
i
owd
enough
to
leave
it
to
young
uns
anna
forced
her
courage
to
the
verge
of
rashness
moved
by
a
swift
impulse
you
wait
one
minute
she
said
to
mynors
am
going
to
the
service
if
i
late
back
father
agnes
will
see
to
the
tea
wait
for
me
she
looked
him
straight
in
the
face
it
was
one
of
the
bravest
acts
of
her
life
after
the
episode
of
breakfast
to
suggest
a
procedure
which
might
entail
any
risk
upon
another
meal
was
absolutely
heroic
tellwright
glanced
away
from
his
daughter
and
at
mynors
anna
hurried
upstairs
thy
lawyer
mr
mynors
tellwright
asked
said
mynors
be
convenient
dane
does
my
bit
o
business
too
i
see
him
and
make
a
bargain
wi
him
for
th
partnership
deed
he
always
works
by
contract
for
me
i
no
patience
wi
mynors
assented
must
come
down
some
afternoon
and
look
over
the
works
he
said
to
anna
as
they
were
walking
down
trafalgar
road
towards
chapel
should
like
to
anna
replied
never
been
over
a
works
in
my
life
you
are
going
to
be
a
partner
in
the
best
works
of
its
size
in
bursley
mynors
said
enthusiastically
glad
of
that
she
smiled
i
do
believe
i
own
the
worst
price
do
you
mean
she
nodded
he
exclaimed
and
seemed
to
be
thinking
was
sure
whether
that
belonged
to
you
or
your
father
i
afraid
it
is
quite
the
best
of
properties
but
perhaps
i
better
say
nothing
about
that
we
had
a
grand
meeting
last
night
our
little
quite
lived
up
to
his
reputation
do
you
think
she
said
faintly
enjoyed
the
meeting
she
blurted
out
dismayed
but
resolute
to
be
honest
there
was
a
silence
you
were
at
the
early
this
morning
i
hear
she
said
nothing
while
they
took
a
dozen
paces
and
then
murmured
their
eyes
met
for
a
second
hers
full
of
trouble
he
said
at
length
excuse
me
saying
this
but
you
may
be
expecting
too
much
she
encouraged
him
prepared
now
to
finish
what
had
been
begun
mean
he
said
earnestly
i
we
can
not
promise
you
any
sudden
change
of
feeling
any
sudden
relief
and
certainty
such
as
some
people
experience
at
least
i
never
had
it
what
is
called
conversion
can
happen
in
various
ways
it
is
a
question
of
living
of
constant
endeavour
with
the
example
of
christ
always
before
us
it
need
not
always
be
a
sudden
wrench
you
know
from
the
world
perhaps
you
have
been
expecting
too
much
he
repeated
as
though
offering
balm
with
that
phrase
she
thanked
him
sincerely
but
not
with
her
lips
only
with
the
heart
he
had
revealed
to
her
an
avenue
of
release
from
a
situation
which
had
seemed
on
all
sides
fatally
closed
she
sprang
eagerly
towards
it
she
realised
afresh
how
frightful
was
the
dilemma
from
which
there
was
now
a
hope
of
escape
and
she
was
grateful
accordingly
before
she
had
not
dared
steadily
to
face
its
terrors
she
wondered
that
even
her
father
displeasure
or
the
project
of
the
partnership
had
been
able
to
divert
her
from
the
plight
of
her
soul
putting
these
mundane
things
firmly
behind
her
she
concentrated
the
activities
of
her
brain
on
that
idea
of
living
day
by
day
hour
by
hour
of
a
gradual
aspiration
towards
christ
and
thereby
an
ultimate
arrival
at
the
state
of
being
saved
this
she
thought
she
might
accomplish
this
gave
opportunity
of
immediate
effort
dispensing
with
the
necessity
of
an
impossible
violent
spiritual
metamorphosis
they
did
not
speak
again
until
they
had
reached
the
gates
of
the
chapel
when
mynors
who
had
to
enter
the
choir
from
the
back
bade
her
a
quiet
adieu
anna
enjoyed
the
service
which
passed
smoothly
and
uneventfully
at
a
revival
night
is
the
time
of
ecstasy
and
fervour
and
salvation
in
the
afternoon
one
must
be
content
with
preparatory
praise
and
prayer
that
evening
while
father
and
daughters
sat
in
the
parlour
after
supper
there
was
a
ring
at
the
door
agnes
ran
to
open
and
found
willie
price
it
had
begun
to
rain
and
the
visitor
his
turned
up
was
wet
and
draggled
agnes
left
him
on
the
mat
and
ran
back
to
the
parlour
price
wants
to
see
you
father
tellwright
motioned
to
her
to
shut
the
door
best
see
him
anna
he
said
none
my
business
what
has
he
come
about
father
note
as
i
sent
down
this
morning
i
told
owd
titus
as

especially

bank
notes

pay
twenty
pun
and
thirty
suppose
he
says
he
ca
him
he
must
i
figured
it
out
and
changed
my
mind
about
that
works
owd
titus
isna
done
for
yet
though
he
getting
on
that
road
us
can
screw
another
fifty
out
o
him
that
only
leave
six
months
rent
owing
then
us

turn
him
out
he
go

claim
for
our
rent
afore
th
other
creditors
and
us
have
a

or
a
hundred
and
twenty
in
hand
towards
doing
the
owd
place
up
a
bit
for
a
new
tenant
him
bankrupt
father
anna
exclaimed
it
was
the
only
part
of
the
ingenious
scheme
which
she
had
understood
he
said
laconically
would
christ
have
driven
titus
price
into
the
bankruptcy
court
he
pays
well
and
good
you
better
see
william
father
property
is
it
mine
or
thine
tellwright
growled
his
good
humour
was
still
precarious
insecurely
and
anna
obediently
left
the
room
after
all
she
said
to
herself
a
debt
is
a
debt
and
honest
people
pay
what
they
owe
it
was
in
an
uncomplaisant
tone
that
anna
invited
willie
price
to
the
front
parlour
nervousness
always
made
her
seem
harsh
and
moreover
she
had
not
the
trick
of
hiding
firmness
under
suavity
you
come
this
way
mr
price
he
said
with
ingratiating
eager
compliance
dusk
was
falling
and
the
room
in
shadow
she
forgot
to
ask
him
to
take
a
chair
so
they
both
stood
up
during
the
interview
grand
meeting
we
had
last
night
he
began
twisting
his
hat
saw
you
there
miss
tellwright
there
was
a
splendid
muster
of
teachers
i
wanted
to
be
at
the
this
morning
but
could
get
away
did
you
happen
to
go
miss
tellwright
she
saw
that
he
knew
that
she
had
been
present
and
gave
him
another
curt
monosyllable
she
would
have
liked
to
be
kind
to
him
to
reassure
him
to
make
him
happy
and
comfortable
so
ludicrous
and
touching
were
his
efforts
after
a
social
urbanity
which
should
appease
but
just
as
much
as
he
she
was
unskilled
in
the
subtle
arts
of
converse
he
continued
i
was
anxious
to
be
at
meeting
but
the
dad
asked
me
to
come
up
here
he
said
i
better
that
term
dad
uttered
in
william
slow
drawling
voice
seemed
to
show
titus
price
in
a
new
light
to
anna
as
a
human
creature
loved
not
as
a
mere
gross
physical
organism
the
effect
was
quite
surprising
william
went
on
i
see
your
father
miss
tellwright
it
about
the
rent
he
said
if
you
will
tell
me
i
beg
pardon
he
said
quickly
course
i
know
it
your
property
but
i
thought
tellwright
always
saw
after
it
for
you
it
was
he
that
wrote
that
letter
this
morning
was
it
anna
replied
she
did
not
explain
the
situation
insist
on
another
twenty
pounds
on
monday
she
said
paid
ten
last
monday
there
is
still
over
a
hundred
owing
know
but
oh
miss
tellwright
you
must
be
hard
on
us
bad
says
in
the
signal
that
trade
is
improving
she
interrupted
sharply
it
he
said
look
at
prices
they
cut
till
there
no
profit
left
i
assure
you
miss
tellwright
my
father
and
me
are
having
a
hard
struggle
everything
against
us
and
the
works
in
particular
as
you
know
his
tone
was
so
earnest
so
pathetic
that
tears
of
compassion
almost
rose
to
her
eyes
as
she
looked
at
those
simple
naïve
blue
eyes
of
his
his
lanky
figure
and
clothes
his
feeble
placatory
smile
the
twitching
movements
of
his
long
red
hands
all
contributed
to
the
effect
of
his
defencelessness
she
thought
of
the
test
are
the
meek
and
saw
in
a
flash
the
deep
truth
of
it
here
were
she
and
her
father
rich
powerful
autocratic
and
there
were
willie
price
and
his
father
commercial
hares
hunted
by
hounds
of
creditors
hares
that
turned
in
plaintive
appeal
to
those
greedy
jaws
for
mercy
and
yet
she
a
hound
envied
at
that
moment
the
hares
blessed
are
the
meek
blessed
are
the
failures
blessed
are
the
stupid
for
they
unknown
to
themselves
have
a
grace
which
is
denied
to
the
haughty
the
successful
and
the
wise
the
very
repulsiveness
of
old
titus
his
underhand
methods
his
insincerities
only
served
to
increase
her
sympathy
for
the
pair
how
could
titus
help
being
himself
any
more
than
henry
mynors
could
help
being
himself
and
that
idea
led
her
to
think
of
the
prospective
partnership
destined
by
every
favourable
sign
to
brilliant
success
and
to
contrast
it
with
the
ignoble
and
forlorn
undertaking
in
edward
street
she
tried
to
discover
some
method
of
soothing
the
young
man
fears
of
being
considerate
to
him
without
injuring
her
father
scheme
you
will
pay
what
you
owe
she
said
will
spend
it
all
every
penny
on
improving
the
works
tellwright
he
answered
with
fatal
emphasis
can
not
pay
ah
she
wished
to
follow
christ
day
by
day
hour
by
hour
constantly
to
endeavour
after
saintliness
what
was
she
to
do
now
left
to
herself
she
might
have
said
in
a
burst
of
impulsive
generosity
forgive
you
all
arrears
start
afresh
but
her
father
had
to
be
reckoned
with
much
do
you
think
you
can
pay
on
monday
she
asked
coldly
at
that
moment
her
father
entered
the
room
his
first
act
was
to
light
the
gas
willie
price
eyes
blinked
at
the
glare
as
though
he
were
trembling
before
the
anticipated
decree
of
this
implacable
old
man
anna
heart
beat
with
sympathetic
apprehension
tellwright
shook
hands
grimly
with
the
youth
who
hurriedly
what
he
had
said
to
anna
o
the
old
man
began
with
finality
and
stopped
anna
caught
a
glance
from
him
dismissing
her
she
went
out
in
silence
on
the
monday
titus
price
paid
another
twenty
pounds

corruption

the

at

with
a
note

tellwrights
were
having

the
note
could
be
seen
in
his
enormous
hand
and
agnes
went
out

if

he
said
to
her
touching
his
hat
and
giving
a
pull
to
the
leathern
belt
which
surrounding
his
waist
alone
seemed
to
hold
his
frame
together
agnes
much
impressed
took
the
note
she
had
never
before
seen
that
resplendent
automaton
apart
from
the
equipage
which
he
directed
always
afterwards
barrett
formally
saluted
her
in
the
streets
affording
her
thus
every
time
a
thrilling
moment
of
delicious
joy
letter
and
there
an
answer
and
he
waiting
she
cried
running
into
the
parlour
row
said
her
father

it
me

miss
tellwright
that
anna
is
it
oh
scent
she
put
the
grey
envelope
to
her
nose
like
a
flower
anna
secretly
as
excited
as
her
sister
opened
the
note
and
read

child
energetically

ink
and
paper
she
flew
about
and
hovered
over
anna
while
the
answer
to
the
invitation
was
being
written
anna
made
her
reply
as
short
and
simple
as
possible
and
then
tendered
it
for
her
father
inspection
that
do
he
pretended
to
be
nonchalant
but
in
fact
he
was
somewhat
interested

all
his
comment
and
he
threw
the
note
back
put
wednesday
not
the
date
it
matter
beatrice
sutton
only
puts
wednesday
his
response
was
to
walk
out
of
the
room
he
vexed
agnes
asked
anxiously
there
had
been
a
whole
week
of
almost
perfect
amenity
the
next
day
at
three
anna
having
put
on
her
best
clothes
was
ready
to
start
she
had
seen
almost
nothing
of
social
life
and
the
prospect
of
taking
part
in
this
entertainment
of
the
suttons
filled
her
with
trepidation
should
she
arrive
early
in
which
case
she
would
have
to
talk
more
or
late
in
which
case
there
would
be
the
ordeal
of
entering
a
crowded
room
she
could
not
decide
she
went
into
her
father
bedroom
whose
window
overlooked
trafalgar
road
and
saw
from
behind
a
curtain
that
small
groups
of
ladies
were
continually
passing
up
the
street
to
disappear
into
alderman
sutton
house
most
of
the
women
she
recognised
others
she
knew
but
vaguely
by
sight
then
the
stream
ceased
and
suddenly
she
heard
the
kitchen
clock
strike
four
she
ran
downstairs
agnes
swollen
by
importance
was
carrying
her
father
tea
into
the
parlour
and
hastened
out
the
back
way
in
another
moment
she
was
at
the
suttons
a
servant
in
black
alpaca
with
white
wristbands
cap
streams
and
embroidered
apron
each
article
a
from
bostock
great
shop
at
hanbridge
asked
her
in
a
subdued
and
respectful
tone
to
step
within
externally
there
had
been
no
sign
of
the
unusual
but
once
inside
the
house
anna
found
it
a
humming
hive
of
activity
women
laden
with
stuffs
and
implements
were
crossing
the
hall
their
footsteps
noiseless
on
the
thick
rugs
which
lay
about
in
rich
confusion
on
either
hand
was
an
open
door
and
from
each
door
came
the
sound
of
many
eager
voices
beyond
these
doors
a
broad
staircase
rose
majestically
to
unseen
heights
closing
the
vista
of
the
hall
as
the
servant
was
demanding
anna
name
beatrice
sutton
radiant
and
gorgeous
came
with
a
rush
out
of
the
room
to
the
left
the
and
taking
her
by
both
hands
kissed
her
dear
we
thought
you
were
never
coming
everyone
here
except
the
men
of
course
come
along
upstairs
and
take
your
things
off
so
glad
you
kept
your
promise
you
think
i
should
break
it
said
anna
as
they
ascended
the
easy
gradient
of
the
stairs
no
my
dear
but
you
such
a
shy
little
bird
the
conception
of
herself
as
a
shy
little
bird
amused
anna
by
a
curious
chain
of
ideas
she
came
to
wonder
who
could
clean
those
stairs
the
better
she
or
this
gay
and
flitting
butterfly
in
a
pale
green
beatrice
led
the
way
to
a
large
bedroom
crammed
with
furniture
and
there
were
three
mirrors
in
this
spacious
apartment
one
in
the
wardrobe
a
and
a
third
over
the
mantelpiece
the
frame
of
the
last
was
bordered
with
photographs
is
my
room
said
beatrice
you
put
your
things
on
the
bed
the
bed
was
already
laden
with
hats
bonnets
jackets
and
wraps
hope
your
mother
wo
give
me
anything
fancy
to
do
anna
said
no
good
at
anything
except
plain
sewing
that
all
right
beatrice
answered
carelessly
all
plain
sewing
she
drew
a
cardboard
box
from
her
pocket
and
offered
it
to
anna
have
one
they
were
chocolate
creams
said
anna
taking
one
they
very
expensive
never
seen
any
like
these
before
just
ordinary
four
shillings
a
pound
papa
buys
them
for
me
i
simply
dote
on
them
i
love
to
eat
them
in
bed
if
i
ca
sleep
beatrice
made
these
statements
with
her
mouth
full
you
adore
chocolates
she
added
do
know
anna
lamely
replied
i
like
them
she
only
adored
her
sister
and
perhaps
god
and
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
tasted
chocolate
could
without
them
said
beatrice
hair
is
lovely
i
never
saw
such
a
brown
what
wash
do
you
use
anna
repeated
do
you
put
anything
on
it
never
take
care
you
do
lose
it
that
all
now
will
you
come
and
have
just
a
peep
at
my
studio
where
i
paint
you
know
i
like
you
to
see
it
before
we
go
down
they
proceeded
to
a
small
room
on
the
second
floor
with
a
sloping
ceiling
and
a
dormer
window
obliged
to
have
this
room
beatrice
explained
it
the
only
one
in
the
house
with
a
north
light
and
of
course
you
ca
do
without
that
how
do
you
like
it
anna
said
that
she
liked
it
very
much
the
walls
of
the
room
were
hung
with
various
odd
curtains
of
eastern
design
attached
somehow
to
these
curtains
some
coloured
plates
bits
of
pewter
and
a
few
fans
were
hung
high
in
apparently
precarious
suspense
lower
down
on
the
walls
were
pictures
and
sketches
chiefly
unframed
of
flowers
fishes
loaves
of
bread
candlesticks
mugs
oranges
and
on
an
immense
easel
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
an
unfinished
portrait
of
a
man
that
anna
asked
ignorant
of
those
rules
of
caution
which
are
observed
by
the
practised
frequenter
of
studios
you
know
beatrice
exclaimed
shocked
papa
i
doing
his
portrait
he
sits
in
that
chair
there
the
silly
old
master
at
the
school
wo
let
me
draw
from
life
yet
he
keeps
me
to
the
antique
so
i
said
to
myself
i
would
study
the
living
model
at
home
dreadfully
in
earnest
about
it
you
know
i
really
am
mother
says
i
work
far
too
long
up
here
anna
was
unable
to
perceive
that
the
picture
bore
any
resemblance
to
alderman
sutton
except
in
the
matter
of
the
aldermanic
robe
which
she
could
now
trace
beneath
the
portrait
neck
the
studies
on
the
walls
pleased
her
much
better
their
realism
amazed
her
one
could
make
out
not
only
that
here
for
instance
was
a
fish
there
was
no
doubt
that
it
was
a
hallibut
the
solid
roundness
of
the
oranges
and
the
glitter
on
the
seemed
miraculously
achieved
you
actually
done
all
these
she
asked
in
genuine
admiration
think
splendid
yes
they
all
mine
they
only
studies
beatrice
said
contemptuously
of
them
but
she
was
nevertheless
flattered
see
now
that
that
sutton
anna
said
pointing
to
the
easel
picture
it
pa
right
enough
but
i
sure
i
boring
you
let
go
down
now
or
perhaps
we
shall
catch
it
from
mother
as
anna
in
the
wake
of
beatrice
entered
the
a
dozen
or
more
women
glanced
at
her
with
keen
curiosity
and
the
even
flow
of
conversation
ceased
for
a
moment
to
be
immediately
resumed
in
the
centre
of
the
room
with
her
back
to
the
sutton
was
seated
at
a
square
table
cutting
out
although
the
afternoon
was
warm
she
had
a
white
woollen
wrap
over
her
shoulders
for
the
rest
she
was
attired
in
plain
black
silk
with
a
large
stuff
apron
containing
a
pocket
for
scissors
and
chalk
she
jumped
up
with
the
activity
of
which
beatrice
had
inherited
a
part
and
greeted
anna
kissing
her
heartily
are
you
my
dear
so
pleased
you
have
come
the
phrases
came
from
her
thin
nervous
lips
full
of
sincere
and
kindly
welcome
her
wrinkled
face
broke
into
a
warm
smile
find
miss
anna
a
chair
there
were
two
chairs
in
the
bay
of
the
window
and
one
of
them
was
occupied
by
miss
dickinson
whom
anna
slightly
knew
the
other
being
empty
was
assigned
to
the
you
want
something
to
do
i
suppose
said
beatrice
let
miss
tellwright
have
something
to
get
on
with
at
once
she
has
a
lot
of
time
to
make
up
sutton
who
had
sat
down
again
smiled
across
at
anna
me
see
now
what
can
we
give
her
several
of
those
boys
nightgowns
ready
tacked
said
miss
dickinson
who
was
stitching
at
a
boy
nightgown
one
and
she
picked
up
an
inchoate
garment
from
the
floor
miss
tellwright
would
mind
finishing
it
i
will
do
my
best
at
it
said
anna
the
thoughtless
girl
had
arrived
at
the
sewing
meeting
without
needles
or
thimble
or
scissors
but
one
lady
or
another
supplied
these
deficiencies
and
soon
she
was
at
work
she
stitched
her
best
and
her
hardest
with
head
bent
and
all
her
wits
concentrated
on
the
task
most
of
the
others
seemed
to
be
doing
likewise
though
not
to
the
detriment
of
conversation
beatrice
sank
down
on
a
stool
near
her
mother
and
threading
a
needle
with
coloured
silk
took
up
a
long
piece
of
elaborate
embroidery
the
general
subjects
of
talk
were
the
revival
now
over
with
a
superb
record
of
seventy
saved
souls
the
shortly
to
occur
the
summer
holidays
the
fashions
and
the
change
of
ministers
which
would
take
place
in
august
the
talkers
were
the
wives
and
daughters
of
tradesmen
and
small
manufacturers
together
with
a
few
girls
of
a
somewhat
lower
status
employed
in
shops
it
was
for
the
sake
of
these
latter
that
the
sewing
meeting
was
always
fixed
for
the
weekly
the
splendour
of
sutton
was
a
little
dazzling
to
most
of
the
guests
and
sutton
herself
seemed
scarcely
of
a
piece
with
it
the
fact
was
that
the
luxury
of
the
abode
was
mainly
due
to
alderman
sutton
inability
to
refuse
anything
to
his
daughter
whose
tastes
lay
in
the
direction
of
rich
draperies
large
or
quaint
chairs
occasional
tables
dwarf
screens
mirrors
and
an
opulence
of
the
hand
of
beatrice
might
be
perceived
everywhere
even
in
the
position
of
the
piano
whose
back
adorned
with
silks
and
photographs
was
turned
away
from
the
wall
the
pictures
on
the
walls
had
been
acquired
gradually
by
sutton
at
auction
sales
it
was
commonly
held
that
he
had
an
excellent
taste
in
pictures
and
that
his
daughter
aptitude
for
the
arts
came
from
him
and
not
from
her
mother
the
gilt
clock
and
side
pieces
on
the
mantelpiece
were
also
peculiarly
sutton
having
been
publicly
presented
to
him
by
the
directors
of
a
local
building
society
of
which
he
had
been
chairman
for
many
years
less
intimidated
by
all
this
unexampled
luxury
than
she
was
reassured
by
the
atmosphere
of
combined
and
homely
effort
the
lowliness
of
several
of
her
companions
and
the
kind
simple
face
of
sutton
anna
quickly
began
to
feel
at
ease
she
paused
in
her
work
and
glancing
around
her
happened
to
catch
the
eye
of
miss
dickinson
who
offered
a
remark
about
the
weather
miss
dickinson
was
at
a
draper
in
luke
square
and
a
pillar
of
the
which
sunday
by
sunday
and
year
by
year
had
watched
her
develop
from
a
girl
into
a
confirmed
spinster
with
sallow
and
warted
face
miss
dickinson
supported
her
mother
and
was
a
pattern
to
her
sex
she
was
lovable
but
had
never
been
loved
she
would
have
made
an
admirable
wife
and
mother
but
fate
had
decided
that
this
material
was
to
be
wasted
miss
dickinson
found
compensation
for
the
rigour
of
destiny
in
gossip
as
innocent
as
indiscreet
it
was
said
that
she
had
a
tongue
hear
said
miss
dickinson
lowering
her
contralto
voice
to
a
confidential
tone
you
are
going
into
partnership
with
mynors
miss
tellwright
the
suddenness
of
the
attack
took
anna
by
surprise
her
first
defensive
impulse
was
boldly
to
deny
the
statement
or
at
the
least
to
say
that
it
was
premature
a
fortnight
ago
under
similar
circumstances
she
would
not
have
hesitated
to
do
so
but
for
more
than
a
week
anna
had
been
a
new
life
which
chiefly
meant
a
meticulous
avoidance
of
the
sins
of
speech
never
to
deviate
from
the
truth
never
to
utter
an
unkind
or
a
thoughtless
word
under
whatever
provocation
these
were
two
of
her
rules
she
answered
miss
dickinson
am
a
novelty
is
it
miss
dickinson
smiled
amiably
do
know
said
anna
only
a
business
arrangement
father
arranged
it
really
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
i
had
no
idea
that
people
were
talking
about
it
of
course
should
never
breathe
a
syllable
miss
dickinson
said
with
emphasis
make
a
practice
of
never
talking
about
other
people
affairs
i
always
find
that
best
do
you
but
i
happened
to
hear
it
mentioned
in
the
shop
very
funny
how
things
get
abroad
is
it
said
anna
indeed
miss
dickinson
concurred
mynors
has
been
to
our
sewing
meetings
for
quite
a
long
time
but
i
expect
he
turn
up
anna
took
thought
this
a
sort
of
special
meeting
then
not
at
all
but
we
all
of
us
said
just
now
while
you
were
upstairs
that
he
would
be
sure
to
come
miss
dickinson
features
skilled
in
innuendo
conveyed
that
which
was
too
delicate
for
utterance
anna
said
nothing
see
a
good
deal
of
him
at
your
house
do
you
miss
dickinson
continued
comes
sometimes
to
see
father
on
business
anna
replied
sharply
breaking
one
of
her
rules
of
course
i
meant
that
you
did
suppose
i
meant
anything
else
did
you
miss
dickinson
smiled
pleasantly
she
was
years
of
age
twenty
of
those
years
she
had
passed
in
a
desolating
routine
she
had
existed
in
the
midst
of
life
and
never
lived
she
knew
no
finer
joy
than
that
which
she
at
that
moment
experienced
again
anna
offered
no
reply
the
door
opened
and
every
eye
was
centred
on
the
stately
clayton
vernon
who
with
banks
the
minister
wife
was
in
charge
of
the
other
half
of
the
sewing
party
in
the
clayton
vernon
had
heroic
proportions
a
nose
which
everyone
admitted
to
be
aristocratic
exquisite
tact
and
the
calm
consciousness
of
social
superiority
in
bursley
she
was
a
great
lady
her
instincts
were
those
of
a
great
lady
and
she
would
have
been
a
great
lady
no
matter
to
what
sphere
her
god
had
called
her
she
had
abundant
white
hair
and
wore
a
flowered
purple
silk
in
the
antique
taste
my
dear
she
began
have
deserted
us
i
mrs
vernon
the
girl
answered
with
involuntary
deference
was
just
coming
in
i
am
sent
as
a
deputation
from
the
other
room
to
ask
you
to
sing
something
very
busy
vernon
i
shall
never
get
this
finished
in
time
shall
all
work
better
for
a
little
music
clayton
vernon
urged
voice
is
a
precious
gift
and
should
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
all
we
entreat
my
dear
girl
beatrice
arose
from
the
footstool
and
dropped
her
embroidery
you
said
clayton
vernon
both
doors
are
left
open
we
shall
hear
nicely
would
you
like
beatrice
asked
once
heard
you
sing
nazareth
and
i
shall
never
forget
it
sing
that
it
will
do
us
all
good
clayton
vernon
departed
with
the
large
movement
of
an
argosy
and
beatrice
sat
down
to
the
piano
and
removed
her
bracelets
accompaniment
is
simply
frightful
towards
the
end
she
said
looking
at
anna
with
a
grimace
mistakes
during
the
song
sutton
beckoned
with
her
finger
to
anna
to
come
and
occupy
the
stool
vacated
by
beatrice
glad
to
leave
the
vicinity
of
miss
dickinson
anna
obeyed
creeping
on
tiptoe
across
the
intervening
space
thought
i
would
like
to
have
you
near
me
my
dear
she
whispered
maternally
when
beatrice
had
sung
the
song
and
somehow
executed
that
accompaniment
which
has
terrorised
whole
multitudes
of
pianists
there
was
a
great
deal
of
applause
from
both
rooms
sutton
bent
down
and
whispered
in
anna
ear
voice
has
been
very
well
trained
has
it
not
very
anna
replied
but
though
had
seemed
to
her
wonderful
she
had
neither
understood
it
nor
enjoyed
it
she
tried
to
like
it
but
the
effect
of
it
on
her
was
bizarre
rather
than
pleasing
shortly
after
five
the
gong
sounded
for
tea
and
the
ladies
bidden
by
sutton
unanimously
thronged
into
the
hall
and
towards
a
room
at
the
back
of
the
house
beatrice
came
and
took
anna
by
the
arm
as
they
were
crossing
the
hall
there
was
a
ring
at
the
door
father
and
banks
too
beatrice
exclaimed
opening
to
them
everyone
in
the
vicinity
animated
suddenly
by
this
appearance
of
the
male
sex
turned
with
welcoming
smiles
greeting
to
you
all
the
minister
ejaculated
with
formal
suavity
as
he
removed
his
low
hat
the
alderman
beamed
a
rather
goodwill
on
the
entire
company
and
said
i
see
we
just
in
time
for
tea
then
he
kissed
his
daughter
and
she
accepted
from
him
his
hat
and
stick
tellwright
pa
beatrice
said
drawing
anna
forward
he
shook
hands
with
her
heartily
emerging
for
a
moment
from
the
benignant
dream
in
which
he
seemed
usually
to
exist
that
air
of
being
rapt
by
some
inward
vision
common
in
very
old
men
probably
signified
nothing
in
the
case
of
william
sutton
it
was
a
habitual
pose
into
which
he
had
perhaps
unconsciously
fallen
but
people
connected
it
with
his
humble
archæological
geological
and
zoological
hobbies
which
had
sprung
from
his
membership
of
the
five
towns
field
club
and
which
most
of
his
acquaintances
regarded
with
amiable
secret
disdain
at
a
once
held
at
a
popular
rural
resort
he
had
taken
some
of
the
teachers
to
a
cave
and
pointing
out
the
formation
of
its
roof
had
told
them
that
this
peculiar
phenomenon
had
actually
been
caused
by
waves
of
the
sea
the
discovery
valid
enough
and
perfectly
substantiated
by
an
inquiry
into
the
levels
was
extremely
creditable
to
the
amateur
geologist
but
it
seriously
impaired
his
reputation
among
the
wesleyan
community
as
a
shrewd
man
of
the
world
few
believed
the
statement
or
even
tried
to
believe
it
and
nearly
all
thenceforth
looked
on
him
as
a
man
who
must
be
humoured
in
his
harmless
hallucinations
and
inexplicable
curiosities
on
the
other
hand
the
collection
of
arrowheads
roman
pottery
fossils
and
birds
eggs
which
he
had
given
to
the
museum
in
the
wedgwood
institution
was
always
viewed
with
municipal
pride
the
opened
by
a
large
french
window
into
a
conservatory
and
a
table
was
laid
down
the
whole
length
of
the
room
and
the
conservatory
sutton
sat
at
one
end
and
the
minister
at
the
other
but
neither
sutton
nor
beatrice
occupied
a
distinctive
place
the
ancient
clumsy
custom
of
having
on
the
table
itself
had
been
abolished
by
beatrice
who
had
read
in
a
paper
that
carving
was
now
never
done
at
table
but
by
a
at
the
sideboard
consequently
the
were
exiled
to
the
sideboard
and
the
tea
dispensed
by
a
couple
of
maids
thus
as
beatrice
had
explained
to
her
mother
the
hostess
was
left
free
to
devote
herself
to
the
social
arts
the
board
was
richly
spread
with
fancy
breads
and
cakes
jams
of
sutton
own
celebrated
preserving
diverse
sandwiches
compiled
by
beatrice
and
one
or
two
large
examples
of
the
famous
bursley
numerous
as
the
company
was
several
chairs
remained
empty
after
everyone
was
seated
anna
found
herself
again
next
to
miss
dickinson
and
five
places
from
the
minister
in
the
conservatory
beatrice
and
her
mother
were
higher
up
in
the
room
grace
was
sung
by
request
of
sutton
at
first
silence
prevailed
among
the
guests
and
the
inquiries
of
the
maids
about
milk
and
sugar
were
almost
painfully
audible
then
banks
glancing
up
the
long
vista
of
the
table
and
pretending
to
descry
some
object
in
the
distance
called
out
host
i
doubt
not
you
are
there
but
i
can
only
see
you
with
the
eye
of
faith
at
this
all
laughed
and
a
natural
ease
was
established
the
minister
and
clayton
vernon
who
sat
on
his
right
exchanged
badinage
on
the
merits
and
demerits
of
and
their
neighbours
formed
an
appreciative
audience
then
there
was
a
sharp
ring
at
the
front
door
and
one
of
the
maids
went
out
i
tell
you
miss
dickinson
whispered
to
anna
asked
anna
he
would
come
mynors
i
mean
can
that
be
sutton
voice
was
heard
from
the
room
dare
say
it
henry
mother
beatrice
answered
mynors
entered
joyous
and
a
white
rose
in
his
coat
he
shook
hands
with
and
sutton
sent
a
greeting
down
the
table
to
banks
and
clayton
vernon
and
offered
a
general
apology
for
being
late
here
said
beatrice
to
him
sharply
indicating
a
chair
between
banks
and
herself
banks
has
a
word
to
say
to
you
about
the
singing
of
that
anthem
last
sunday
mynors
made
some
laughing
rejoinder
and
the
voices
sank
so
that
anna
could
not
catch
what
was
said
a
new
frock
that
miss
sutton
is
wearing
miss
dickinson
remarked
in
an
undertone
looks
new
anna
agreed
you
like
it
do
you
yes
it
was
made
at
brunt
at
hanbridge
it
quite
the
fashion
to
go
there
now
said
miss
dickinson
and
added
almost
inaudibly
put
it
on
for
mynors
you
saw
how
she
saved
that
chair
for
him
anna
made
no
reply
you
know
they
were
engaged
once
miss
dickinson
resumed
said
anna
least
people
said
they
were
it
was
all
over
the
town
oh
let
me
see
three
years
ago
had
not
heard
said
anna
during
the
rest
of
the
meal
she
said
little
on
some
natures
miss
dickinson
gossip
had
the
effect
of
bringing
them
to
silence
anna
had
not
seen
mynors
since
the
previous
sunday
and
now
she
was
apparently
unperceived
by
him
he
talked
gaily
with
beatrice
and
banks
that
group
was
a
centre
of
animation
anna
envied
their
ease
of
manner
their
smooth
and
sparkling
flow
of
conversation
she
had
the
sensation
of
feeling
vulgar
clumsy
mynors
and
beatrice
possessed
something
which
she
would
never
possess
so
they
had
been
engaged
but
had
they
or
was
it
an
idle
rumour
manufactured
by
one
who
spent
her
life
in
such
creations
anna
was
conscious
of
misgivings
she
had
despised
beatrice
once
but
now
it
seemed
that
after
all
beatrice
was
the
natural
equal
of
henry
mynors
was
it
more
likely
that
mynors
or
she
anna
should
be
mistaken
in
beatrice
that
beatrice
had
generous
instincts
she
was
sure
anna
lost
confidence
in
herself
she
felt
humbled
and
shamed
our
hostess
and
the
company
will
kindly
excuse
me
said
the
minister
with
a
pompous
air
looking
at
his
watch
must
go
i
have
an
important
appointment
or
an
appointment
which
some
people
think
is
important
he
got
up
and
made
various
adieux
the
elaborate
meal
complex
with
fifty
dainties
each
of
which
had
to
be
savoured
was
not
nearly
over
the
parson
stopped
in
his
course
up
the
room
to
speak
with
sutton
after
he
had
shaken
hands
with
her
he
caught
the
admired
violet
eyes
of
his
slim
wife
a
lady
of
independent
fortune
whom
the
wives
of
circuit
stewards
found
it
difficult
to
please
in
the
matter
of
furniture
and
who
despite
her
forty
years
still
kept
something
of
the
pose
of
a
spoiled
beauty
as
a
minister
spouse
this
languishing
but
impeccable
and
invariably
correct
dame
was
unique
even
in
the
experience
of
clayton
vernon
you
not
be
home
early
rex
she
asked
in
the
tone
of
a
young
wife
lounging
amid
the
delicate
odours
of
a
boudoir
love
he
replied
with
the
stern
fixity
of
a
histrionic
martyr
you
ever
know
me
have
a
free
evening
the
alderman
accompanied
his
pastor
to
the
door
after
tea
mynors
was
one
of
the
first
to
leave
the
room
and
anna
one
of
the
last
but
he
accosted
her
in
the
hall
on
the
way
back
to
the
and
asked
how
she
was
and
how
agnes
was
with
such
deference
and
sincerity
of
regard
for
herself
and
everything
that
was
hers
that
she
could
not
fail
to
be
impressed
her
sense
of
humiliation
and
of
uncertainty
was
effaced
by
a
single
word
a
single
glance
uplifted
by
a
delicious
reassurance
she
passed
into
the
expecting
him
to
follow
strange
to
say
he
did
not
do
so
work
was
resumed
but
with
less
ardour
than
before
it
was
in
fact
impossible
to
be
strenuously
diligent
after
one
of
sutton
teas
and
in
every
heart
save
those
which
beat
over
the
most
perfect
and
vigorous
digestive
organs
there
was
a
feeling
of
repentance
the
clock
on
the
intoned
seven
all
expressed
surprise
at
the
lateness
of
the
hour
and
clayton
vernon
pleading
fatigue
after
her
recent
indisposition
quietly
departed
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
anna
said
to
sutton
that
she
too
must
go
my
dear
sutton
asked
shall
be
needed
at
home
anna
replied
in
that
case
i
will
come
upstairs
with
you
my
dear
said
sutton
when
they
were
in
the
bedroom
sutton
suddenly
clasped
her
hand
is
it
with
you
dear
anna
she
said
gazing
anxiously
into
the
girl
eyes
anna
knew
what
she
meant
but
made
no
answer
it
well
the
earnest
old
woman
asked
hope
so
said
anna
averting
her
eyes
am
trying
sutton
kissed
her
almost
passionately
my
dear
she
exclaimed
with
an
impulsive
gesture
am
glad
so
glad
i
did
so
want
to
have
a
word
with
you
you
must
lean
hard
as
miss
havergal
says
lean
hard
on
him
do
not
be
afraid
and
then
changing
her
tone
are
looking
pale
anna
you
want
a
holiday
we
shall
be
going
to
the
isle
of
man
in
august
or
september
would
your
father
let
you
come
with
us
do
know
said
anna
she
knew
however
that
he
would
not
nevertheless
the
suggestion
gave
her
much
pleasure
must
see
about
that
later
said
sutton
and
they
went
downstairs
must
say
to
beatrice
where
is
she
anna
said
in
the
hall
one
of
the
servants
directed
them
to
the
the
alderman
and
henry
mynors
were
looking
together
at
a
large
photogravure
of
sant
soul
awakening
which
sutton
had
recently
bought
and
beatrice
was
exhibiting
her
embroidery
to
a
group
of
ladies
sundry
stitchers
were
scattered
about
including
miss
dickinson
is
a
great
picture
a
picture
that
makes
you
think
henry
was
saying
seriously
and
the
alderman
feeling
as
the
artist
might
have
felt
was
obviously
flattered
by
this
sagacious
praise
anna
said
to
miss
dickinson
and
then
to
beatrice
mynors
hearing
the
words
turned
round
i
must
go
good
evening
he
said
suddenly
to
the
astonished
alderman
now
the
latter
inquired
scarcely
pleased
to
find
that
mynors
could
tear
himself
away
from
the
picture
with
so
little
difficulty
mynors
said
anna
i
may
i
will
walk
down
with
you
mynors
imperturbably
answered
it
was
one
of
those
dramatic
moments
which
arrive
without
the
slightest
warning
the
gleam
of
joyous
satisfaction
in
miss
dickinson
eyes
showed
that
she
alone
had
foreseen
this
declaration
for
a
declaration
it
was
and
a
formal
declaration
mynors
stood
there
calm
confident
with
masculine
superiority
and
his
glance
seemed
to
say
to
those
swiftly
alert
women
whose
faces
could
not
disguise
a
thrilling
excitation
let
all
know
that
i
henry
mynors
the
desired
of
all
am
honourably
captive
to
this
shy
and
perfect
creature
who
is
blushing
because
i
have
said
what
i
have
said
even
the
alderman
forgot
his
photogravure
beatrice
hurriedly
resumed
her
explanation
of
the
embroidery
did
you
like
the
sewing
meeting
mynors
asked
anna
when
they
were
on
the
pavement
anna
paused
think
sutton
is
simply
a
splendid
woman
she
said
enthusiastically
when
in
a
moment
far
too
short
they
reached
tellwright
house
mynors
obeying
a
mutual
wish
to
which
neither
had
given
expression
followed
anna
up
the
side
entry
and
so
into
the
yard
where
they
lingered
for
a
few
seconds
old
tellwright
could
be
seen
at
the
extremity
of
the
long
narrow
garden
a
garden
which
consisted
chiefly
of
a
sown
with
and
a
narrow
bordering
of
flower
beds
without
flowers
agnes
was
invisible
the
stood
ajar
and
as
this
was
the
sole
means
of
ingress
from
the
yard
anna
humming
an
air
pushed
it
open
and
entered
mynors
in
her
wake
they
stood
on
the
threshold
happy
hesitating
confused
and
looked
at
the
kitchen
as
at
something
which
they
had
not
seen
before
kitchen
was
the
only
satisfactory
apartment
in
the
house
its
furniture
included
a
dresser
of
the
simple
and
dignified
kind
which
is
now
assiduously
collected
by
amateurs
of
old
oak
it
had
four
long
narrow
shelves
holding
plates
and
saucers
the
cups
were
hung
in
a
row
on
small
brass
hooks
screwed
into
the
fronts
of
the
shelves
below
the
shelves
were
three
drawers
in
a
line
with
brass
handles
and
below
the
drawers
was
a
large
recess
which
held
stone
jars
a
copper
and
other
receptacles
seventy
years
of
continuous
polishing
by
a
dynasty
of
priestesses
of
cleanliness
had
given
to
this
dresser
a
rich
ripe
tone
which
the
cleverest
could
not
have
imitated
in
it
was
reflected
the
conscientious
labour
of
generations
it
had
a
soft
and
assuaged
appearance
as
though
it
had
never
been
new
and
could
never
have
been
new
all
its
corners
and
edges
had
long
lost
the
asperities
of
manufacture
and
its
smooth
surfaces
were
marked
by
slight
hollows
similar
in
spirit
to
those
worn
by
the
naked
feet
of
pilgrims
into
the
marble
steps
of
a
shrine
the
flat
portion
over
the
drawers
was
scarred
with
hundreds
of
scratches
and
yet
even
all
these
seemed
to
be
incredibly
ancient
and
in
some
distant
past
to
have
partaken
of
the
mellowness
of
the
whole
the
dark
woodwork
formed
an
admirable
background
for
the
crockery
on
the
shelves
and
a
few
of
the
old
plates
according
to
some
vanished
secret
in
pigments
which
time
could
only
improve
had
the
look
of
relationship
by
birth
to
the
dresser
there
must
still
be
thousands
of
exactly
similar
dressers
in
the
kitchens
of
the
people
but
they
are
gradually
being
transferred
to
the
dining
rooms
of
to
anna
this
piece
of
furniture
which
would
have
made
the
most
taciturn
collector
vocal
with
joy
was
merely
dresser
she
had
always
lamented
that
it
contained
no
cupboard
in
front
of
the
fireless
range
was
an
old
steel
kitchen
fender
with
heavy
it
had
in
the
middle
of
its
flat
top
a
circular
lodgment
for
saucepans
but
on
this
polished
disc
no
saucepan
was
ever
placed
the
fender
was
perhaps
as
old
as
the
dresser
and
the
profound
depths
of
its
polish
served
to
mitigate
somewhat
the
newness
of
the
patent
range
which
tellwright
had
had
put
in
when
he
took
the
house
on
the
high
mantelpiece
were
four
tall
brass
candlesticks
which
like
the
dresser
were
silently
awaiting
their
apotheosis
at
the
hands
of
some
collector
beside
these
were
two
or
three
common
mustard
tins
polished
to
counterfeit
silver
containing
spices
also
an
abandoned
and
two
a
grandfather
clock
of
oak
to
match
the
dresser
stood
to
the
left
of
the
fireplace
it
had
a
very
large
white
dial
with
a
grinning
face
in
the
centre
though
it
would
only
run
for
hours
its
leisured
movement
seemed
to
have
the
certainty
of
a
natural
law
especially
to
agnes
for
tellwright
never
forgot
to
wind
it
before
going
to
bed
under
the
window
was
a
plain
deal
table
with
white
top
and
stained
legs
two
windsor
chairs
completed
the
catalogue
of
furniture
the
glistening
floor
was
of
red
and
black
tiles
and
in
front
of
the
fender
lay
a
list
hearthrug
made
by
attaching
innumerable
bits
of
black
cloth
to
a
canvas
base
on
the
painted
walls
were
several
grocers
almanacs
depicting
sailors
in
the
arms
of
lovers
children
crossing
brooks
or
monks
swelling
themselves
with
gargantuan
repasts
everything
in
this
kitchen
was
absolutely
bright
and
spotless
as
clean
as
a
cat
in
pattens
except
the
ceiling
darkened
by
fumes
of
gas
everything
was
in
perfect
order
and
had
the
humanised
air
of
use
and
occupation
which
nothing
but
use
and
occupation
can
impart
to
senseless
objects
it
was
a
kitchen
where
in
the
housewife
phrase
you
might
eat
off
the
floor
and
to
any
bursley
matron
it
would
have
constituted
the
highest
possible
certificate
of
anna
character
not
only
as
housewife
but
as
elder
sister
for
in
her
absence
agnes
had
washed
the
and
put
them
away
is
the
nicest
room
i
know
said
mynors
at
length
do
you
mean
anna
smiled
incapable
of
course
of
seeing
the
place
with
his
eye
mean
there
is
nothing
to
beat
a
clean
straight
kitchen
mynors
replied
there
never
will
be
it
wants
only
the
mistress
in
a
white
apron
to
make
it
complete
do
you
know
when
i
came
in
here
the
other
night
and
you
were
sitting
at
the
table
there
i
thought
the
place
was
like
a
picture
funny
said
anna
puzzled
but
well
satisfied
wo
you
come
into
the
parlour
the
persian
with
one
ear
met
them
in
the
lobby
his
tail
flying
but
cautiously
sidled
upstairs
at
sight
of
mynors
when
anna
opened
the
door
of
the
parlour
she
saw
agnes
seated
at
the
table
over
her
lessons
frowning
and
preoccupied
tears
were
in
her
eyes
what
the
matter
agnes
she
exclaimed
go
away
said
the
child
crossly
bother
what
the
matter
you
crying
i
not
i
doing
my
sums
and
i
ca
get
it
ca
the
child
burst
into
tears
just
as
mynors
entered
his
presence
was
a
complete
surprise
to
her
she
hid
her
face
in
her
pinafore
ashamed
to
be
thus
caught
is
it
said
mynors
is
this
sum
that
wo
come
right
he
picked
up
the
slate
and
examined
it
while
agnes
was
finding
herself
again
he
exclaimed
agnes
got
as
far
as
practice
she
gave
him
an
instant
glance
and
murmured
before
she
could
shelter
her
face
he
had
kissed
her
anna
was
enchanted
by
his
manner
and
as
for
agnes
she
surrendered
happily
to
him
at
once
he
worked
the
sum
and
she
copied
the
figures
into
her
anna
sat
and
watched
i
must
go
said
mynors
surely
you
stay
and
see
father
anna
urged
i
really
had
not
meant
to
call
agnes
in
a
moment
he
was
gone
out
of
the
room
and
the
house
it
was
as
if
in
obedience
to
a
sudden
impulse
he
had
forcibly
torn
himself
away
at
the
sewing
meeting
agnes
asked
adding
in
parenthesis
never
dreamt
he
was
here
and
i
was
frightfully
vexed
i
felt
such
a
baby
at
least
he
came
for
tea
did
he
call
here
like
that
can
i
tell
anna
said
the
child
looked
at
her
awfully
queer
is
it
she
said
slowly
me
all
about
the
sewing
meeting
did
they
have
cakes
or
was
it
a
plain
tea
and
did
you
go

chapter
viii
on
the
bank
anna
began
to
receive
her
july
interest
and
dividends
during
a
fortnight
remittances
varying
from
a
few
pounds
to
a
few
hundred
of
pounds
arrived
by
post
almost
daily
they
were
all
addressed
to
her
since
the
securities
now
stood
in
her
own
name
and
upon
her
under
the
miser
superintendence
fell
the
new
task
of
entering
them
in
a
book
and
paying
them
into
the
bank
this
mysterious
begetting
of
money
by
money
a
strange
process
continually
going
forward
for
her
benefit
in
various
parts
of
the
world
far
and
near
by
means
of
activities
of
which
she
was
completely
ignorant
and
would
always
be
completely
ignorant
bewildered
her
and
gave
her
a
feeling
of
its
unreality
the
elaborate
mechanism
by
which
capital
yields
interest
without
suffering
diminution
from
its
original
bulk
is
one
of
the
commonest
phenomena
of
modern
life
and
one
of
the
least
understood
many
capitalists
never
grasp
it
nor
experience
the
slightest
curiosity
about
it
until
the
mechanism
through
some
defect
ceases
to
revolve
tellwright
was
of
these
for
him
the
interval
between
the
outlay
of
capital
and
the
receipt
of
interest
was
nothing
but
an
efflux
of
time
he
planted
capital
as
a
gardener
plants
rhubarb
tolerably
certain
of
a
particular
result
but
not
dwelling
even
in
thought
on
that
which
is
hidden
the
productivity
of
capital
was
to
him
the
greatest
achievement
of
social
progress
indeed
the
social
organism
justified
its
existence
by
that
achievement
nothing
could
be
more
equitable
than
this
productivity
nothing
more
natural
he
would
as
soon
have
inquired
into
it
as
agnes
would
have
inquired
into
the
ticking
of
the
grandfather
clock
but
to
anna
who
had
some
imagination
and
whose
imagination
had
been
stirred
by
recent
events
the
arrival
of
moneys
out
of
space
unearned
unasked
was
a
disturbing
experience
affecting
her
as
a
conjuring
trick
affects
a
child
whose
sensations
hesitate
between
pleasure
and
apprehension
practically
anna
could
not
believe
that
she
was
rich
and
in
fact
she
was
not
rich
she
was
merely
a
fixed
point
through
which
moneys
that
she
was
unable
to
arrest
passed
with
the
rapidity
of
trains
if
money
is
a
token
anna
was
denied
the
satisfaction
of
fingering
even
the
token
drafts
and
cheques
were
all
that
she
touched
touched
only
to
abandon
the
doubly
tantalising
and
insubstantial
tokens
of
a
token
she
wanted
to
test
the
actuality
of
this
apparent
dream
by
handling
coin
and
causing
it
to
vanish
over
counters
and
into
the
palms
of
the
necessitous
and
moreover
quite
apart
from
this
curiosity
she
really
needed
money
for
pressing
requirements
of
agnes
and
herself
they
had
yet
had
no
new
summer
clothes
and
whitsuntide
the
time
prescribed
by
custom
for
the
refurnishing
of
wardrobes
was
long
since
past
the
intercourse
with
henry
mynors
the
visit
to
the
suttons
had
revealed
to
her
more
plainly
than
ever
the
intolerable
shortcomings
of
her
wardrobe
and
similar
imperfections
she
was
more
painfully
awake
to
these
and
yet
by
an
unhappy
paradox
she
was
even
less
in
a
position
to
remedy
them
than
in
previous
years
for
now
she
possessed
her
own
fortune
to
ask
her
father
bounty
was
therefore
she
divined
a
sure
way
of
inviting
a
rebuff
but
even
if
she
had
dared
she
might
not
use
the
income
that
was
privately
hers
for
was
not
every
penny
of
it
already
allocated
to
the
partnership
with
mynors
so
it
happened
that
she
never
once
mentioned
the
matter
to
her
father
she
lacked
the
courage
since
by
whatever
avenue
she
approached
it
circumstances
would
add
an
illogical
and
adventitious
force
to
the
brutal
snubs
which
he
invariably
dealt
out
when
petitioned
for
money
to
demand
his
money
having
fifty
thousand
of
her
own
to
spend
her
own
in
the
face
of
that
agreement
with
mynors
she
could
too
easily
guess
his
bitter
and
humiliating
retorts
to
either
proposition
and
she
kept
silence
comforting
herself
with
timid
visions
of
a
far
distant
future
the
balance
at
the
bank
crept
up
to
sixteen
hundred
pounds
the
deed
of
partnership
was
drawn
her
father
pored
over
the
blue
draft
and
several
times
mynors
called
and
the
two
men
discussed
it
together
then
one
morning
her
father
summoned
her
into
the
front
parlour
and
handed
to
her
a
piece
of
parchment
on
which
she
dimly
deciphered
her
own
name
coupled
with
that
of
henry
mynors
in
large
letters
mun
sign
seal
and
deliver
this
he
said
putting
a
pen
in
her
hand
she
sat
down
obediently
to
write
but
he
stopped
her
with
a
scornful
gesture
sign
blind
then
eh
just
like
a
woman
left
it
to
you
she
said
it
to
me
read
it
she
read
through
the
deed
and
after
she
had
accomplished
the
feat
one
fact
only
stood
clear
in
her
mind
that
the
partnership
was
for
seven
years
a
period
extensible
by
consent
of
both
parties
to
fourteen
or
years
then
she
affixed
her
signature
the
pen
moving
awkwardly
over
the
rough
surface
of
the
parchment
put
thy
finger
on
that
bit
o
wax
and
say
i
deliver
this
as
my
act
and
deed
deliver
this
as
my
act
and
deed
the
old
man
signed
as
witness
as
i
give
this
to
lawyer
dane
he
remarked
bound
law
law
and
bound
on
the
following
day
she
had
to
sign
a
cheque
which
reduced
her
to
about
three
pounds
perhaps
it
was
the
knowledge
of
this
reduction
that
led
ephraim
tellwright
to
resume
at
once
and
with
fresh
rigour
his
new
policy
of
the
last
penny
out
of
titus
price
despite
the
fact
that
the
latter
had
already
achieved
the
incredible
by
paying
thirty
pounds
in
little
more
than
a
month
thus
causing
the
catastrophe
which
soon
afterwards
befell
what
methods
her
father
was
adopting
anna
did
not
know
since
he
said
no
word
to
her
about
the
matter
she
only
knew
that
agnes
had
twice
been
dispatched
with
notes
to
edward
street
one
day
about
noon
a
urchin
brought
a
letter
addressed
to
herself
she
guessed
that
it
was
some
appeal
for
mercy
from
the
prices
and
wished
that
her
father
had
been
at
home
the
old
man
was
away
for
the
whole
day
attending
a
sale
of
property
at
axe
the
agricultural
town
in
the
north
of
the
county
locally
styled
metropolis
of
the
moorlands
anna
read
dear
miss
tellwright
now
that
our
partnership
is
an
accomplished
fact
will
you
not
come
and
look
over
the
works
i
should
much
like
you
to
do
so
i
shall
be
passing
your
house
this
afternoon
about
two
and
will
call
on
the
chance
of
being
able
to
take
you
down
with
me
to
the
works
if
you
are
unable
to
come
no
harm
will
be
done
and
some
other
day
can
be
arranged
but
of
course
i
shall
be
believe
me
yours
most
sincerely
hy
mynors
she
was
charmed
with
the
idea
to
her
so
audacious
and
relieved
that
the
note
was
not
after
all
from
titus
or
willie
price
but
again
she
had
to
regret
that
her
father
was
not
at
home
he
would
be
capable
of
thinking
and
saying
that
the
projected
expedition
was
a
truancy
contrived
to
occur
in
his
absence
he
might
grumble
at
the
house
being
left
without
a
keeper
moreover
according
to
a
tacit
law
she
never
departed
from
the
fixed
routine
of
her
existence
without
first
obtaining
ephraim
approval
or
at
least
being
sure
that
such
a
departure
would
not
make
him
violently
angry
she
wondered
whether
mynors
knew
that
her
father
was
away
and
if
so
whether
he
had
chosen
that
afternoon
purposely
she
did
not
care
that
mynors
should
call
for
her
it
made
the
visit
seem
so
formal
and
as
in
order
to
reach
the
works
down
at
shawport
by
the
they
would
necessarily
go
through
the
middle
of
the
town
she
foresaw
infinite
gossip
and
rumour
as
one
result
already
she
knew
the
names
of
herself
and
mynors
were
everywhere
coupled
and
she
could
not
even
enter
a
shop
without
being
made
aware
more
or
less
delicately
that
she
was
an
object
of
piquant
curiosity
a
woman
is
profoundly
interesting
to
women
at
two
periods
only
before
she
is
betrothed
and
before
she
becomes
the
mother
of
her
firstborn
anna
was
in
the
first
period
her
life
did
not
comprise
the
second
when
agnes
came
home
to
dinner
from
school
anna
said
nothing
of
mynors
note
until
they
had
begun
to
wash
up
the
when
she
suggested
that
agnes
should
finish
this
operation
alone
said
agnes
ever
compliant
why
going
out
and
i
must
get
ready
out
and
shall
you
leave
the
house
all
empty
what
will
father
say
where
are
you
going
to
agnes
tendency
to
anticipate
the
worst
and
never
to
blink
their
father
tyranny
always
annoyed
anna
and
she
answered
rather
curtly
going
to
the
works
mynors
works
he
sent
word
he
wants
me
to
she
despised
herself
for
wishing
to
hide
anything
and
added
will

ran
upstairs
to
dress
at
ten
minutes
to
two
she
was
ready
agnes
usually
left
at
a
quarter
to
two
but
the
child
had
not
yet
gone
at
five
minutes
to
two
anna
called
downstairs
to
her
to
ask
her
when
she
meant
to
depart
just
going
now
agnes
shouted
back
she
opened
the
front
door
and
then

foot
of
the
stairs

waiting

dreaming
of
the
elder
sister
reproved
he
is
coming
from
the
town
all
right
and
the
child
at
last
went
it
was
something
after
two
every
siren
and
hooter
had
long
since
finished
the
summons
to
work
when
mynors
rang
the
bell
anna
was
still
upstairs
she
examined
herself
in
the
glass
and
then
descended
slowly
afternoon
he
said
see
you
are
ready
to
come
i
very
glad
i
hope
i
have
inconvenienced
you
but
just
this
afternoon
seemed
to
be
a
good
opportunity
for
you
to
see
the
works
and
you
know
you
ought
to
see
it
father
in
she
said
shall
leave
the
house
to
take
care
of
itself
do
you
want
to
see
him
specially
he
replied
think
we
have
settled
everything
she
banged
the
door
behind
her
and
they
started
as
he
held
open
the
gate
for
her
exit
she
could
not
ignore
the
look
of
passionate
admiration
on
his
face
it
was
a
look
disconcerting
by
its
mere
intensity
the
man
could
control
his
tongue
but
not
his
eyes
his
demeanour
as
she
viewed
it
aggravated
her
as
they
braved
the
streets
but
she
was
happy
in
her
perturbation
when
they
reached
duck
bank
mynors
asked
her
whether
they
should
go
through
the
or
along
king
street
by
the
bottom
of
luke
square
the
she
said
the
shop
where
miss
dickinson
was
employed
was
at
the
bottom
of
luke
square
and
all
the
eyes
of
the
marketplace
was
preferable
to
the
chance
of
those
eyes
probably
no
one
in
the
five
towns
takes
a
conscious
pride
in
the
antiquity
of
the
potter
craft
nor
in
its
unique
and
intimate
relation
to
human
life
alike
civilised
and
uncivilised
man
hardened
clay
into
a
bowl
before
he
spun
flax
and
made
a
garment
and
the
last
lone
man
will
want
an
earthen
vessel
after
he
has
abandoned
his
ruined
house
for
a
cave
and
his
woven
rags
for
an
animal
skin
this
supremacy
of
the
most
ancient
of
crafts
is
in
the
secret
nature
of
things
and
can
not
be
explained
history
begins
long
after
the
period
when
bursley
was
first
the
central
seat
of
that
honoured
manufacture
it
is
the
central
seat
still
mother
of
the
five
towns
in
our
local
phrase
and
though
the
townsmen
absorbed
in
a
strenuous
daily
struggle
may
forget
their
heirship
to
an
unbroken
tradition
of
countless
centuries
the
seal
of
their
venerable
calling
is
upon
their
foreheads
if
no
other
relic
of
an
immemorial
past
is
to
be
seen
in
these
modernised
sordid
streets
there
is
at
least
the
living
legacy
of
that
extraordinary
kinship
between
workman
and
work
that
instinctive
mastery
of
clay
which
the
past
has
bestowed
upon
the
present
the
horse
is
less
to
the
arab
than
clay
is
to
the
bursley
man
he
exists
in
it
and
by
it
it
fills
his
lungs
and
blanches
his
cheek
it
keeps
him
alive
and
it
kills
him
his
fingers
close
round
it
as
round
the
hand
of
a
friend
he
knows
all
its
tricks
and
aptitudes
when
to
coax
and
when
to
force
it
when
to
rely
on
it
and
when
to
distrust
it
the
weavers
of
lancashire
have
dubbed
him
with
an
obscene
epithet
on
account
of
it
an
epithet
whose
hasty
use
has
led
to
many
a
fight
but
nothing
could
be
more
illuminatively
descriptive
than
that
epithet
which
names
his
vocation
in
terms
of
another
vocation
a
dozen
decades
of
applied
science
have
of
course
resulted
in
the
interposition
of
elaborate
machinery
between
the
clay
and
the
man
but
no
great
vulgar
handicraft
has
lost
less
of
the
human
than
potting
clay
is
always
clay
and
the
contrivance
that
will
mould
a
basin
while
a
man
sits
and
watches
has
yet
to
be
invented
moreover
if
in
some
coarser
process
the
hands
are
superseded
the
number
of
processes
has
been
multiplied
tenfold
the
ware
in
which
six
men
formerly
collaborated
is
now
produced
by
sixty
and
thus
in
one
sense
the
touch
of
finger
on
clay
is
more
pervasive
than
ever
before
mynors
works
was
acknowledged
to
be
one
of
the
best
of
its
size
in
the
district
a
model
bank
and
it
must
be
remembered
that
of
the
hundreds
of
banks
in
the
five
towns
the
vast
majority
are
small
like
this
the
large
manufactory
with
its
corps
of
one
of
whom
is
detached
to
show
visitors
round
so
much
of
the
works
as
is
deemed
advisable
for
them
to
see
is
the
exception
mynors
paid
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
in
rent
and
produced
nearly
three
hundred
pounds
worth
of
work
a
week
he
was
his
own
manager
and
there
was
only
one
on
the
place
a
clerk
at
eighteen
shillings
he
employed
about
a
hundred
hands
and
devoted
all
his
ingenuity
to
prevent
that
wastage
which
is
at
once
the
easiest
to
overlook
and
the
most
difficult
to
check
the
wastage
of
labour
no
pains
were
spared
to
keep
all
departments
in
full
and
regular
activity
and
owing
to
his
judicious
firmness
the
feast
of
monday
that
canker
eternally
eating
at
the
root
of
the
prosperity
of
the
five
towns
was
less
religiously
observed
on
his
bank
than
perhaps
anywhere
else
in
bursley
he
had
realised
that
when
a
workshop
stands
empty
the
employer
has
not
only
ceased
to
make
money
but
has
begun
to
lose
it
the
architect
of
works
providence
stands
godfather
to
many
commercial
enterprises
in
the
five
towns
knew
his
business
and
the
business
of
the
potter
and
he
had
designed
the
works
with
a
view
to
the
strictest
economy
of
labour
the
various
shops
were
so
arranged
that
in
the
course
of
its
metamorphosis
the
clay
travelled
naturally
in
a
circle
from
the
by
the
canal
to
the
by
the
canal
there
was
no
carrying
to
and
fro
the
steam
installation
was
complete
steam
once
generated
had
no
respite
after
it
had
exhausted
itself
in
vitalising
fifty
machines
it
was
killed
by
inches
in
order
to
dry
the
unfired
ware
and
warm
the
dinners
of
the
workpeople
henry
took
anna
to
the
because
the
buildings
looked
best
from
that
side
how
much
is
a
crate
worth
she
asked
pointing
to
a
crate
which
was
being
swung
on
a
crane
direct
from
the
into
a
boat
mynors
answered
crateful
of
ware
may
be
worth
anything
at
minton
i
have
seen
a
crate
worth
three
hundred
pounds
but
that
one
there
is
only
worth
eight
or
nine
pounds
you
see
you
and
i
make
cheap
stuff
do
you
make
any
really
good
pots
are
they
all
cheap
cheap
he
said
suppose
that
business
he
detected
a
note
of
regret
in
her
voice
do
know
he
said
with
the
slightest
impatient
warmth
make
the
stuff
as
good
as
we
can
for
the
money
we
supply
what
everyone
wants
do
you
think
it
better
to
please
a
thousand
folks
than
to
please
ten
i
like
to
feel
that
my
ware
is
used
all
over
the
country
and
the
colonies
i
would
sooner
do
as
i
do
than
make
swagger
ware
for
a
handful
of
rich
people
yes
she
exclaimed
eagerly
accepting
the
point
of
view
quite
agree
with
you
she
had
never
heard
him
in
that
vein
before
and
was
struck
by
his
enthusiasm
and
mynors
was
in
fact
always
very
enthusiastic
concerning
the
virtues
of
the
general
markets
he
had
no
sympathy
with
specialities
artistic
or
otherwise
he
found
his
satisfaction
in
honestly
meeting
the
public
taste
he
was
born
to
be
a
manufacturer
of
cheap
goods
on
a
colossal
scale
he
could
dream
of
fifty
ovens
and
his
ambition
blinded
him
to
the
present
absurdity
of
talking
about
a
bank
spreading
its
productions
all
over
the
country
and
the
colonies
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
there
were
yet
scarcely
enough
plates
to
go
round
suppose
we
had
better
start
at
the
start
he
said
leading
the
way
to
the
he
did
not
need
to
be
told
that
anna
was
perfectly
ignorant
of
the
craft
of
pottery
and
that
every
detail
of
it
so
stale
to
him
would
acquire
freshness
under
her
naïve
and
inquiring
gaze
in
the
begins
the
long
manipulation
which
transforms
raw
porous
friable
clay
into
the
moulded
decorated
and
glazed
vessel
the
large
whitewashed
place
was
occupied
by
ungainly
machines
and
receptacles
through
which
the
four
sorts
of
clay
used
in
the
common
ball
clay
china
clay
flint
clay
and
stone
clay
were
compelled
to
pass
before
they
became
a
white
mixture
meet
for
shaping
by
human
hands
the
blunger
crushed
the
clay
the
sifter
extracted
the
iron
from
it
by
means
of
a
magnet
the
press
expelled
the
water
and
the
expelled
the
air
from
the
last
reluctant
mouth
slowly
emerged
a
solid
stream
nearly
a
foot
in
diameter
like
a
huge
white
snake
already
the
clay
had
acquired
the
uniformity
characteristic
of
a
manufactured
product
anna
moved
to
touch
the
bolts
of
the
enormous
press
stand
there
said
mynors
pressure
is
tremendous
and
if
the
thing
were
to
burst
she
fled
hastily
is
it
dangerous
for
the
workmen
she
asked
eli
machin
the
engineman
the
oldest
employee
on
the
works
a
moneyed
man
and
the
pattern
of
reliability
allowed
a
vague
smile
to
flit
across
his
face
at
this
remark
he
had
ascended
from
the
below
in
order
to
exhibit
the
tricks
of
the
various
machines
and
that
done
he
disappeared
anna
was
awed
by
the
sensation
of
being
surrounded
by
terrific
forces
always
straining
for
release
and
held
in
check
by
the
power
of
a
single
wall
and
see
a
plate
made
that
is
one
of
the
simplest
things
and
the
is
worth
looking
at
said
mynors
and
they
went
into
the
nearest
shop
a
hot
interior
in
the
shape
of
four
corridors
round
a
solid
square
middle
here
men
and
women
were
working
side
by
side
the
women
subordinate
to
the
men
all
were
preoccupied
wrapped
up
in
their
respective
operations
and
there
was
the
sound
of
irregular
whirring
movements
from
every
part
of
the
big
room
the
air
was
laden
with
whitish
dust
and
clay
was
omnipresent
on
the
floor
the
walls
the
benches
the
windows
on
clothes
hands
and
faces
it
was
in
this
shop
where
both
pressers
and
flat
pressers
were
busy
as
only
craftsmen
on
piecework
can
be
busy
that
more
than
anywhere
else
clay
was
to
be
seen
the
hand
of
the
potter
near
the
door
a
stout
man
with
a
face
flung
some
clay
on
to
a
revolving
disc
and
even
as
anna
passed
a
jar
sprang
into
existence
one
instant
the
clay
was
an
amorphous
mass
the
next
it
was
a
vessel
perfectly
circular
of
a
prescribed
width
and
a
prescribed
depth
the
flat
and
apparently
clumsy
fingers
of
the
craftsman
had
seemed
to
lose
themselves
in
the
clay
for
a
fraction
of
time
and
the
miracle
was
accomplished
the
man
threw
these
vessels
with
the
rapidity
of
a
roman
candle
throwing
off
coloured
stars
and
one
woman
was
kept
busy
in
supplying
him
with
material
and
relieving
his
bench
of
the
finished
articles
mynors
drew
anna
along
to
the
for
plate
makers
at
that
period
rather
a
novelty
and
the
latest
invention
of
the
dead
genius
whose
brain
has
reconstituted
a
whole
industry
on
new
lines
confronted
with
a
piece
of
clay
the
descended
upon
it
with
the
ferocity
of
a
wild
animal
worried
it
stretched
it
smoothed
it
into
the
width
and
thickness
of
a
plate
and
then
desisted
of
itself
and
waited
inactive
for
the
flat
presser
to
remove
its
victim
to
his
more
exact
shaping
machine
several
men
were
producing
plates
but
their
rapid
labours
seemed
less
astonishing
than
the
preliminary
feat
of
the
all
the
ware
as
it
was
moulded
disappeared
into
the
vast
cupboards
occupying
the
centre
of
the
shop
where
mynors
showed
anna
innumerable
rows
of
shelves
full
of
pots
in
process
of
neither
time
nor
space
nor
material
was
wasted
in
this
of
industry
in
order
to
move
to
and
fro
the
women
were
compelled
to
insinuate
themselves
past
the
stationary
bodies
of
the
men
anna
marvelled
at
the
careless
accuracy
with
which
they
fed
the
with
lumps
precisely
calculated
to
form
a
plate
of
a
given
diameter
everyone
exerted
himself
as
though
the
salvation
of
the
world
hung
on
the
production
of
so
much
stuff
by
a
certain
hour
dust
heat
and
the
presence
of
a
stranger
were
alike
unheeded
in
the
mad
creative
passion
said
mynors
the
cicerone
opening
another
door
which
gave
into
the
yard
all
that
stuff
is
dried
and
fettled
smoothed
you
know
it
goes
into
the
biscuit
oven
that
the
first
firing
the
biscuit
oven
but
we
ca
inspect
it
because
it
just
being
drawn
he
pointed
to
the
oven
near
by
in
whose
dark
interior
the
forms
of
men
naked
to
the
waist
could
dimly
be
seen
struggling
with
the
weight
of
saggars
full
of
ware
it
seemed
like
some
release
of
martyrs
this
unpacking
of
the
immense
oven
which
after
being
flooded
with
a
sea
of
flame
for
hours
had
cooled
for
two
days
and
was
yet
hotter
than
the
equator
the
inertness
and
pallor
of
the
saggars
seemed
to
be
the
physical
result
of
their
fiery
trial
and
one
wondered
that
they
should
have
survived
the
trial
mynors
went
into
the
place
adjoining
the
oven
and
brought
back
a
plate
out
of
an
open
saggar
it
was
still
quite
warm
it
had
the
surface
of
a
biscuit
and
adhered
slightly
to
the
fingers
it
was
now
a
it
had
exchanged
malleability
for
brittleness
and
nothing
mortal
could
undo
what
the
fire
had
done
mynors
took
the
plate
with
him
to
the
a
long
room
where
one
was
forced
to
keep
to
narrow
alleys
amid
parterres
of
pots
a
solitary
was
examining
the
ware
in
order
to
determine
the
remuneration
of
the
pressers
they
climbed
a
flight
of
steps
to
the
where
by
means
of
mineral
colours
and
most
of
the
decoration
was
done
the
room
was
filled
by
a
little
crowd
of
people
oldish
men
women
and
girls
divided
into
printers
cutters
transferors
and
apprentices
each
interminably
repeated
some
trifling
process
and
every
article
passed
through
a
succession
of
hands
until
at
length
it
was
washed
in
a
tank
and
rose
dripping
therefrom
with
its
ornament
of
flowers
and
scrolls
fully
revealed
the
room
smelt
of
oil
and
flannel
and
humanity
the
atmosphere
was
more
languid
more
like
that
of
a
family
party
than
in
the
pressers
shop
the
old
women
looked
stern
and
shrewish
the
pretty
young
women
pert
and
defiant
the
younger
girls
meek
the
few
men
seemed
out
of
place
by
what
trick
had
they
crept
into
the
very
centre
of
that
mass
of
femineity
it
seemed
wrong
scandalous
that
they
should
remain
contiguous
with
the
was
the
in
which
the
labours
of
the
former
were
taken
to
a
finish
by
the
brush
of
the
paintress
who
filled
in
outlines
with
flat
colour
and
thus
converted
mechanical
printing
into
handiwork
the
paintresses
form
the
of
the
banks
their
task
is
a
light
one
demanding
deftness
first
of
all
they
have
delicate
fingers
and
enjoy
a
general
reputation
for
beauty
the
wages
they
earn
may
be
estimated
from
their
finery
on
sundays
they
come
to
business
in
cloth
jackets
carry
dinner
in
little
satchels
in
the
shop
they
wear
white
aprons
and
look
startlingly
neat
and
tidy
across
the
benches
over
which
they
bend
their
coquettish
heads
gossip
flies
and
returns
like
a
shuttle
they
are
the
source
of
a
thousand
intrigues
and
one
or
other
of
them
is
continually
getting
married
or
omitting
to
get
married
on
the
bank
they
constitute
sex
an
infinitesimal
proportion
of
them
from
among
the
branch
known
as
die

a
fact
which
adds
pathos
to
their
frivolous
charm
in
a
subsidiary
room
off
the
a
single
girl
was
seated
at
a
revolving
table
actuated
by
a
treadle
she
was
doing
the
on
the
rims
of
saucers
mynors
and
anna
watched
her
as
with
her
left
hand
she
flicked
saucer
after
saucer
into
the
exact
centre
of
the
table
moved
the
treadle
and
holding
a
brush
firmly
against
the
rim
of
the
piece
produced
with
infallible
exactitude
the
band
and
the
line
she
was
a
brunette
about
she
had
a
calm
vacuously
contemplative
face
but
god
alone
knew
whether
she
thought
her
work
represented
the
summit
of
monotony
the
regularity
of
it
hypnotised
the
observer
and
mynors
himself
was
impressed
by
this
stupendous
phenomenon
of
absolute
sameness
involuntarily
assuming
towards
it
the
attitude
of
a
showman
earns
as
much
as
eighteen
shillings
a
week
sometimes
he
whispered
i
try
anna
timidly
asked
of
a
sudden
curious
to
experience
what
the
trick
was
like
said
mynors
in
eager
assent
let
this
lady
have
your
seat
a
moment
please
the
girl
got
up
smiling
politely
anna
took
her
place
try
on
this
said
mynors
putting
on
the
table
the
plate
which
he
still
carried
a
full
brush
the
paintress
suggested
not
attempting
to
hide
her
amusement
at
anna
unaccustomed
efforts
push
the
treadle
there
it
is
in
the
middle
yet
now
anna
produced
a
most
creditable
band
and
a
trembling
but
passable
line
and
rose
flushed
with
the
small
triumph
have
the
gift
said
mynors
and
the
paintress
respectfully
applauded
felt
i
could
do
it
anna
responded
mother
mother
was
a
paintress
and
it
must
be
in
the
blood
mynors
smiled
indulgently
they
descended
again
to
the
ground
floor
and
following
the
course
of
manufacture
came
to
the
kiln
a
minor
oven
where
for
twelve
hours
the
oil
is
burnt
out
of
the
colour
in
decorated
ware
a
huge
jolly
man
in
shirt
and
trousers
with
an
enormous
apron
was
in
the
act
of
drawing
the
kiln
assisted
by
two
thin
boys
he
nodded
a
greeting
to
mynors
and
exclaimed
the
kiln
was
nearly
emptied
as
anna
stopped
at
the
door
the
man
addressed
her
inside
miss
and
try
it
thanks
she
laughed
now
he
insisted
as
if
despising
this
hesitation
ounce
of
experience
the
two
boys
grinned
and
wiped
their
foreheads
with
their
bare
arms
anna
challenged
by
the
man
look
walked
quickly
into
the
kiln
a
blasting
heat
seemed
to
assault
her
on
every
side
driving
her
back
it
was
incredible
that
any
human
being
could
support
such
a
temperature
said
the
jovial
man
apparently
summing
her
up
with
his
bright
quizzical
eyes
know
summat
as
you
did
know
afore
miss
come
along
lads
he
added
with
brisk
heartiness
to
the
boys
and
the
drawing
of
the
kiln
proceeded
next
came
the
where
a
woman
enveloped
in
a
protective
garment
from
head
to
foot
was
dipping
jugs
into
a
vat
of
a
boy
assisting
her
the
woman
hands
were
covered
with
the
grey
slimy
glaze
she
alone
of
all
the
employees
appeared
to
be
cool
is
the
last
stage
but
one
said
mynors
is
only
the
and
they
passed
out
into
the
yard
once
more
one
of
the
was
empty
they
entered
it
and
peered
into
the
lofty
inner
chamber
which
seemed
like
the
cold
crater
of
an
exhausted
volcano
or
like
a
vault
or
like
the
ruined
seat
of
some
forgotten
activity
the
other
oven
was
firing
and
anna
could
only
look
at
its
exterior
catching
glimpses
of
the
red
glow
at
its
twelve
mouths
and
guess
at
the
tophet
within
where
the
lead
was
being
fused
into
glass
for
the
and
you
will
have
seen
all
said
mynors
the
and
that
does
matter
the
warehouse
was
the
largest
place
on
the
works
a
room
long
and
twenty
broad
low
whitewashed
bare
and
clean
piles
of
ware
occupied
the
whole
of
the
walls
and
of
the
immense
floorspace
but
there
was
no
trace
here
of
the
soilure
and
untidiness
incident
to
manufacture
all
processes
were
at
an
end
clay
had
vanished
into
crock
and
the
calmness
and
the
whiteness
atoned
for
the
disorder
noise
and
squalor
which
had
preceded
here
was
a
sample
of
the
total
and
final
achievement
towards
which
the
thousands
of
small
disjointed
efforts
that
anna
had
witnessed
were
directed
and
it
seemed
a
miraculous
almost
impossible
result
so
definite
precise
and
regular
after
a
series
of
acts
apparently
variable
inexact
and
casual
so
inhuman
after
all
that
intensely
inhuman
labour
so
vast
in
comparison
with
the
minuteness
of
the
separate
endeavours
as
anna
looked
for
instance
at
a
pile
of
she
found
it
difficult
even
to
conceive
that
a
fortnight
or
so
before
they
had
been
nothing
but
lumps
of
dirty
clay
no
stage
of
the
manufacture
was
incredible
by
itself
but
the
result
was
incredible
it
was
the
result
that
appealed
to
the
imagination
authenticating
the
adage
that
fools
and
children
should
never
see
anything
till
it
is
done
anna
pondered
over
the
organising
power
the
forethought
the
wide
vision
and
the
sheer
ingenuity
and
cleverness
which
were
implied
by
the
contents
of
this
warehouse
brains
she
thought
of
mynors
quantities
of
all
sorts
of
things
he
must
know
it
was
a
humble
and
admiration
her
spoken
words
gave
no
clue
to
her
thoughts
seem
to
make
a
fine
lot
of
she
remarked
no
he
said
carelessly
few
that
you
see
here
are
a
special
order
i
do
go
in
much
for
they
do
pay
we
lose
fifteen
per
cent
of
the
pieces
in
making
it
that
pays
and
that
is
our
leading
line
he
waved
an
arm
vaguely
towards
rows
and
rows
of
ewers
and
basins
in
the
distance
they
walked
to
the
end
of
the
warehouse
glancing
at
everything
here
said
mynors
that
pretty
he
pointed
through
the
last
window
to
a
view
of
the
canal
which
could
be
seen
thence
in
perspective
finishing
in
a
curve
on
one
side
close
to
the
edge
was
a
ruined
and
fragmentary
building
its
rich
browns
reflected
in
the
smooth
surface
of
the
canal
on
the
other
side
were
a
few
grim
grey
trees
bordering
the
towpath
down
the
vista
moved
a
boat
steered
by
a
woman
in
a
large
that
picturesque
he
said
anna
assented
willingly
really
quite
strange
such
a
scene
right
in
the
middle
of
bursley
there
are
others
he
said
i
always
take
a
peep
at
that
whenever
i
come
into
the
warehouse
wonder
you
find
time
to
notice
it
with
all
this
place
to
see
after
she
said
a
splendid
works
will
do
to
be
going
on
with
he
answered
satisfied
very
glad
you
been
down
you
must
come
again
i
can
see
you
would
be
interested
in
it
and
there
are
plenty
of
things
you
have
looked
at
yet
you
know
he
smiled
at
her
they
were
alone
in
the
warehouse
she
said
expect
so
well
i
must
go
at
once
i
afraid
it
very
late
now
thank
you
for
showing
me
round
and
explaining
and
i
frightfully
stupid
and
ignorant
vapid
and
trite
phrases
what
unimaginable
messages
the
hearer
heard
in
you
anna
held
out
her
hand
and
he
seized
it
almost
convulsively
his
incendiary
eyes
fastened
on
her
face
must
see
you
out
he
said
dropping
that
ungloved
hand
it
was
ten
that
night
before
ephraim
tellwright
returned
home
from
axe
he
appeared
to
be
in
a
bad
temper
agnes
had
gone
to
bed
his
supper
of
and
water
was
waiting
for
him
and
anna
sat
at
the
table
while
he
consumed
it
he
ate
in
silence
somewhat
hungrily
and
she
did
not
deem
the
moment
propitious
for
telling
him
about
her
visit
to
mynors
works
titus
price
sent
up
he
asked
at
length
gulping
down
the
last
of
the
water
up
art
fond
lass
i
told
him
as
he
mun
send
up
some
more
o
thy
rent
pun
he
not
sent
do
know
she
said
timidly
was
out
this
afternoon
wast
mynors
sent
word
to
ask
me
to
go
down
and
look
over
the
works
so
i
went
i
thought
it
would
be
all
right
it
all
right
and
i
like
to
know
what
business
thou
hast
gadding
out
as
soon
as
my
back
turned
how
can
i
tell
whether
price

up
or
not
and
what
more
thou
know
as
th
house
ought
to
be
left
sorry
she
said
pleasantly
with
a
determination
to
be
meek
and
dutiful
he
grunted
he
didna
send
and
if
he
did
and
found
house
locked
up
he
should
ha
sent
again
bring
me
th
inkpot
and
i
write
a
note
as
agnes
must
take
when
her
goes
to
school
morning
anna
obeyed
never
be
able
to
pay
pounds
father
she
ventured
paid
thirty
already
you
know
gab
he
said
shortly
taking
up
the
pen
write
it
thysen
he
threw
the
pen
towards
her
titus
if
he
does
pay
this
wik
us
put
bailiffs
in
it
come
better
from
you
father
she
pleaded
property
is
it
the
laconic
question
was
final
she
knew
she
must
obey
and
began
to
write
but
realising
that
she
would
perforce
meet
both
titus
price
and
willie
on
sunday
she
merely
demanded
the
money
omitting
the
threat
her
hand
trembled
as
she
passed
the
note
to
him
to
read
that
do
his
reply
was
to
tear
the
paper
across
down
what
i
tell
ye
he
ordered
do
let
have
any
more
paper
wasted
then
he
dictated
a
letter
which
was
an
ultimatum
in
three
lines
it
he
said
she
signed
it
weeping
she
could
see
the
wistful
reproach
in
willie
price
eyes
suppose
her
father
said
when
she
bade
him
suppose
if
i
had
asked
i
should
ha
heard
nowt
o
this
wi
mynors
was
going
to
tell
you
i
had
been
to
the
works
father
she
said
to
that
was
his
final
blow
and
having
delivered
it
he
loosed
the
victim
to
bed
he
said
she
went
upstairs
resolutely
read
her
bible
and
resolutely
prayed
the
artisan
satiric
term
for
anyone
who
does
not
work
in
who
is
not
actually
a
producer
such
as
a
clerk
or
a
pretentious
foreman

the

is

for

chapter
ix
the
treat
this
surly
and
terrorising
ferocity
of
tellwright
was
as
instinctive
as
the
growl
and
spring
of
a
beast
of
prey
he
never
considered
his
attitude
towards
the
women
of
his
household
as
an
unusual
phenomenon
which
needed
justification
or
as
being
in
the
least
abnormal
the
women
of
a
household
were
the
natural
victims
of
their
master
in
his
experience
it
had
always
been
so
in
his
experience
the
master
had
always
by
universal
consent
possessed
certain
rights
over
the
the
happiness
and
the
peace
of
the
defenceless
souls
set
under
him
rights
as
unquestioned
as
those
exercised
by
ivan
the
terrible
such
rights
were
rooted
in
the
secret
nature
of
things
it
was
futile
to
discuss
them
because
their
necessity
and
their
propriety
were
equally
obvious
tellwright
would
not
have
been
angry
with
any
man
who
impugned
them
he
would
merely
have
regarded
the
fellow
as
a
crank
and
a
born
fool
on
whom
logic
or
indignation
would
be
entirely
wasted
he
did
as
his
father
and
uncles
had
done
he
still
thought
of
his
father
as
a
grim
customer
infinitely
more
redoubtable
than
himself
he
really
believed
that
parents
spoiled
their
children
nowadays
to
be
knocked
down
by
a
single
blow
was
one
of
the
punishments
of
his
own
generation
he
could
recall
the
fearful
timidity
of
his
mother
eyes
without
a
trace
of
compassion
his
treatment
of
his
daughters
was
no
part
of
a
system
nor
obedient
to
any
defined
principles
nor
the
expression
of
a
brutal
disposition
nor
the
result
of
habit
it
came
to
him
like
eating
and
like
parsimony
he
belonged
to
the
great
and
powerful
class
of
the
backbone
of
the
british
nation
whose
views
on
cause
ministries
to
tremble
if
you
had
talked
to
him
of
the
domestic
graces
of
life
your
words
would
have
conveyed
to
him
no
meaning
if
you
had
indicted
him
for
simple
unprovoked
rudeness
he
would
have
grinned
well
knowing
that
as
the
king
can
do
no
wrong
so
a
man
can
not
be
rude
in
his
own
house
if
you
had
told
him
that
he
inflicted
purposeless
misery
not
only
on
others
but
on
himself
he
would
have
grinned
again
vaguely
aware
that
he
had
not
tried
to
be
happy
and
rather
despising
happiness
as
a
sort
of
childish
gewgaw
he
had
in
fact
never
been
happy
at
home
he
had
never
known
that
expansion
of
the
spirit
which
is
called
joy
he
existed
continually
under
a
grievance
the
atmosphere
of
manor
terrace
afflicted
him
too
with
a
melancholy
gloom
him
who
had
created
it
had
he
been
capable
of
he
would
have
discovered
that
his
heart
lightened
whenever
he
left
the
house
and
grew
dark
whenever
he
returned
but
he
was
incapable
of
the
feat
his
case
like
every
similar
case
was
irremediable
the
next
morning
his
preposterous
displeasure
lay
like
a
curse
on
the
house
anna
was
silent
and
agnes
moved
on
timid
feet
in
the
afternoon
willie
price
called
in
answer
to
the
note
the
miser
was
in
the
garden
and
agnes
at
school
willie
craven
and
fawning
humility
was
inexpressibly
touching
and
shameful
to
anna
she
longed
to
say
to
him
as
he
stood
hesitant
and
confused
in
the
parlour
in
peace
forget
this
despicable
rent
it
sickens
me
to
see
you
so
she
foresaw
as
the
effect
of
her
father
vindictive
pursuit
of
her
tenants
an
interminable
succession
of
these
mortifying
interviews
rather
hard
on
us
willie
price
began
using
the
old
phrases
but
in
a
tone
of
forced
and
propitiatory
cheerfulness
as
though
he
feared
to
bring
down
a
storm
of
anger
which
should
ruin
all
not
deny
that
we
been
doing
our
best
rent
is
due
you
know
william
she
replied
blushing
yes
he
said
quickly
do
deny
that
i
admit
that
i
did
you
happen
to
see
tellwright
postscript
to
your
letter
she
answered
without
thinking
he
drew
the
letter
soiled
and
creased
from
his
pocket
and
displayed
it
to
her
at
the
foot
of
the
page
she
read
in
ephraim
thick
and
clumsy
characters
this
is
final
father
said
willie
a
little
put
about
he
said
he
never
received
such
a
letter
before
in
the
whole
of
his
business
career
it
is
as
if
need
tell
you
she
interrupted
with
a
sudden
determination
to
get
to
the
worst
without
more
suspense
of
course
i
am
in
father
hands
of
course
miss
tellwright
we
quite
understand
that
quite
it
just
a
matter
of
business
we
owe
a
debt
and
we
must
pay
it
all
we
want
is
time
he
smiled
piteously
at
her
his
blue
eyes
full
of
appeal
she
was
obliged
to
gaze
at
the
floor
she
said
tapping
her
foot
on
the
rug
father
means
what
he
says
she
looked
up
at
him
again
trying
to
soften
her
words
by
means
of
something
more
subtle
than
a
smile
means
what
he
says
willie
agreed
i
admire
him
for
it
the
obsequious
truckling
lie
was
odious
to
her
i
could
see
him
he
ventured
wish
you
would
anna
said
sincerely
you
wanted
she
called
curtly
through
the
window
got
a
proposal
to
make
to
him

continued
while
they
awaited
the
presence
of
the
miser

hardly
think
refuse
it
young
sir
tellwright
said
blandly
with
an
air
almost
insinuating
as
he
entered
willie
price
the
simpleton
was
deceived
by
it
and
taking
courage
adopted
another
line
of
defence
he
thought
the
miser
was
a
little
ashamed
of
his
postscript
your
note
tellwright
i
was
just
telling
miss
tellwright
that
my
father
said
he
had
never
received
such
a
letter
in
the
whole
of
his
business
career
the
youth
assumed
a
discreet
indignation
feyther
had
dozens
o
such
letters
lad
the
miser
said
with
cold
emphasis
my
name
not
tellwright
dunna
tell
me
as
titus
price
never
heard
of
a
bumbailiff
afore
willie
was
crushed
at
a
blow
and
obliged
to
retreat
he
smiled
painfully
tellwright
do
talk
like
that
all
we
want
is
time
is
money
said
tellwright
if
us
give
you
time
us
give
you
money
o
that
it
you
as
mun
give
us
money
that
right
reason
willie
laughed
with
difficulty
here
tellwright
to
cut
a
long
story
short
it
like
this
you
ask
for
pounds
i
got
in
my
pocket
a
bill
of
exchange
drawn
by
us
on
sutton
and
endorsed
by
him
for
thirty
pounds
payable
in
three
months
will
you
take
that
remember
it
for
thirty
and
you
only
ask
for
sutton
has
dealings
with
ye
eh
tellwright
remarked
yes
willie
answered
proudly
buys
off
us
regularly
done
business
for
years
pays
i
bills
at
three
months
eh
the
miser
grinned
said
willie
see
it
said
the
miser
the
bill
the
bill
all
right
willie
took
it
from
his
pocket
and
opening
out
the
blue
paper
gave
it
to
old
tellwright
anna
perceived
the
anxiety
on
the
youth
face
he
flushed
and
his
hand
trembled
she
dared
not
speak
but
she
wished
to
tell
him
to
be
at
ease
she
knew
from
infallible
signs
that
her
father
would
take
the
bill
ephraim
gazed
at
the
stamped
paper
as
at
something
strange
and
unprecedented
in
his
experience
would
want
you
not
to
negotiate
that
bill
said
willie
fact
is
we
promised
sutton
that
that
particular
bill
should
not
leave
our
hands
unless
it
was
absolutely
necessary
so
father
would
like
you
not
to
discount
it
and
he
will
redeem
it
before
it
matures
you
quite
understand
we
do
care
to
offend
an
old
customer
like
mr
sutton
this
bit
o
paper
worth
nowt
for
welly
three
months
the
old
man
said
with
an
affectation
of
bewildered
simplicity
happily
inspired
for
once
willie
made
no
answer
but
put
the
question
you
take
it
us
tak
it
said
tellwright
it
is
but
a
promise
he
was
well
pleased
young
price
face
showed
his
relief
it
was
now
evident
that
he
had
been
passing
through
an
ordeal
anna
guessed
that
perhaps
everything
had
depended
on
the
acceptance
by
tellwright
of
that
bill
had
he
refused
it
prices
she
thought
might
have
come
to
sudden
disaster
she
felt
glad
and
disburdened
for
the
moment
but
immediately
it
occurred
to
her
that
her
father
would
not
rest
satisfied
for
long
a
few
weeks
and
he
would
give
another
turn
to
the
screw
the
tellwrights
were
destined
to
have
other
visitors
that
afternoon
agnes
coming
from
school
was
accompanied
by
a
lady
anna
who
was
setting
the
saw
a
double
shadow
pass
the
window
and
heard
voices
she
ran
into
the
kitchen
and
found
sutton
seated
on
a
chair
breathing
quickly
excuse
me
coming
in
so
unceremoniously
anna
she
said
after
having
kissed
her
heartily
agnes
said
that
she
always
came
in
by
the
back
way
so
i
came
that
way
too
now
i
resting
a
minute
had
to
walk
our
horse
has
gone
lame
this
kind
heart
radiated
a
heavenly
goodwill
even
in
the
most
ordinary
phrases
anna
began
to
expand
at
once
do
come
into
the
parlour
she
said
let
me
make
you
comfortable
a
minute
my
dear
sutton
begged
fanning
herself
with
her
handkerchief
legs
are
so
long
sutton
agnes
protested
laughing
can
you
i
could
scarcely
keep
up
with
you
my
dear
i
never
could
walk
slowly
i
one
of
them
that
go
till
they
drop
it
very
silly
she
smiled
and
the
two
girls
smiled
happily
in
return
said
the
housewife
another
cup
and
saucer
and
plate
agnes
threw
down
her
hat
and
satchel
of
books
eager
to
show
hospitality
still
keeps
very
warm
anna
remarked
as
sutton
was
silent
beautifully
cool
here
said
sutton
see
you
got
your
kitchen
like
a
new
pin
anna
if
you
excuse
me
saying
so
henry
was
very
enthusiastic
about
this
kitchen
the
other
night
at
our
house
mr
mynors
anna
reddened
to
the
eyes
my
dear
and
he
a
very
particular
young
man
you
know
the
kettle
conveniently
boiled
at
that
moment
and
anna
went
to
the
range
to
make
the
tea

all
ready
sutton
she
said
at
length
sure
you
could
do

a
cup

could
said
sutton
what
i
come
for
have
tea
at
four
father
will
be
glad
to
see

the
clock
struck
and
they
went
into
the
parlour
anna
carrying
the
and
the
jug
agnes
had
preceded
them
the
old
man
was
sitting
expectant
in
his
chair
tellwright
said
the
visitor
see
i
called
to
see
you
and
to
beg
a
cup
of
tea
i
overtook
agnes
coming
home
from
school
overtook
her
mind
me
at
my
age
ephraim
rose
slowly
and
shook
hands
welcome
he
said
curtly
but
with
a
kindliness
that
amazed
anna
she
was
unaware
that
in
past
days
he
had
known
sutton
as
a
young
and
charming
girl
a
vision
that
had
stirred
poetic
ideas
in
hundreds
of
prosaic
breasts
tellwright
included
there
was
scarcely
a
male
wesleyan
in
bursley
and
hanbridge
who
had
not
a
peculiar
regard
for
sutton
and
who
did
not
think
that
he
alone
truly
appreciated
her
an
you
bin
tiring
yourself
with
this
afternoon
he
asked
when
they
had
begun
tea
and
sutton
had
refused
a
second
piece
of
have
i
been
doing
i
been
seeing
to
some
inside
repairs
to
the
superintendent
house
be
thankful
you
are
a
wife
anna
does
she
have
to
see
to
the
repairs
of
the
minister
house
anna
asked
surprised
should
just
think
she
does
she
has
to
stand
between
the
wife
and
the
funds
of
the
society
and
reginald
banks
has
been
used
to
the
very
best
of
everything
she
just
a
bit
exacting
though
i
must
say
she
willing
enough
to
spend
her
own
money
too
she
wants
a
new
boiler
in
the
scullery
now
and
i
sure
her
boiler
is
a
great
deal
better
than
ours
but
we
must
try
to
please
her
she
is
used
to
us
rough
folks
and
our
ways
banks
said
to
me
this
afternoon
that
he
tried
always
to
shield
her
from
the
worries
of
this
world
she
smiled
almost
imperceptibly
there
was
a
ring
at
the
bell
and
agnes
much
perturbed
by
the
august
arrival
let
in
banks
himself
i
enter
my
little
dear
said
banks
father
your
sister
in
rains
but
it
pours
said
tellwright
who
had
caught
the
minister
voice
of
angels
said
sutton
laughing
quietly
the
minister
came
grandly
into
the
parlour
how
do
you
do
brother
tellwright
and
you
miss
tellwright
sutton
we
two
seem
happily
fated
to
meet

afternoon

let
me
disturb
you
i
beg
i
can
not
stay
my
time
is
very
limited
i
wish
i
could
call
oftener
brother
tellwright
but
really
the
new
leaves
no
time
for
pastoral
visits
i
was
saying
to
my
wife
only
this
morning
that
i
have
had
a
free
afternoon
for
a
month
he
accepted
a
cup
of
tea
have
a
this
afternoon
said
tellwright
to
sutton
now
the
minister
resumed
come
to
beg
the
special
fund
you
know
tellwright
to
clear
off
the
debt
on
the
new
i
referred
to
it
from
the
pulpit
last
sabbath
not
in
my
province
to
go
round
begging
but
someone
must
do
it
for
me
i
beforehand
with
you
banks
said
sutton
it
on
that
very
errand
i
called
to
see
tellwright
this
afternoon
his
name
is
on
my
list
then
i
leave
our
brother
to
your
superior
persuasions
tellwright
said
sutton
between
two
fires
and
you
get
no
mercy
what
will
you
give
the
miser
foresaw
a
probable
discomfiture
and
sought
for
some
means
of
escape
are
others
giving
he
asked
husband

giving
fifty
pounds
and
you
could
buy
him
up
lock
stock
and
barrel
nay
said
tellwright
aghast
at
this
sum
he
had
underrated
the
importance
of
the
building
fund
i
said
the
parson
solemnly
have
but
fifty
pounds
in
the
world
but
i
am
giving
twenty
to
this
fund
you
giving
too
much
said
tellwright
with
quick
brusqueness
canna
afford
it
lord

provide
said
the
parson
he
will
happen
not
it
as
well
you
gotten
a
rich
wife
mr
banks
the
parson
dignity
was
obviously
wounded
and
anna
wondered
timidly
what
would
occur
next
sutton
interposed
now
tellwright
she
said
again
the
point
what
will
you
give
think
it
over
and
let
you
hear
said
ephraim
no
that
wo
do
at
all
will
it
banks
i
at
any
rate
am
not
going
away
without
a
definite
promise
as
an
old
and
good
wesleyan
of
course
you
will
feel
it
your
duty
to
be
generous
with
us
used
to
be
a
pillar
of
the
hanbridge
circuit
was
it
not
so
said
banks
to
the
miser
recovering
himself
they
used
to
say
tellwright
replied
grimly
was
because
i
cleared
of
debt
in
ten
years
but
they
slipped
into
th
ditch
again
sin
i
left
if
i
am
right
you
do
not
meet
with
us
the
minister
pursued
imperturbably
own
class
is
at
three
on
saturdays
said
the
minister
should
be
glad
to
see
you
tell
you
what
i
do
said
the
miser
to
sutton
price
is
a
big
man
at
th
i
give
as
much
as
he
gives
to
th
school
buildings
that
fair
you
know
what
price
is
giving
sutton
asked
the
minister
saw
price
yesterday
he
is
giving
pounds
well
that
a
bargain
said
sutton
who
had
succeeded
beyond
her
expectations
ephraim
was
the
dupe
of
his
own
scheming
he
had
made
sure
that
price
contribution
would
be
a
small
one
this
ostentatious
munificence
on
the
part
of
the
beggared
titus
filled
him
with
secret
anger
he
determined
to
demand
more
rent
at
a
very
early
date
put
you
down
for
pounds
as
a
first
subscription
said
the
minister
taking
out
a
perhaps
you
will
give
sutton
or
myself
the
cheque
price
paid
the
miser
asked
warily
yet
come
to
me
when
he
has
ephraim
perceived
the
way
of
escape
when
the
minister
was
gone
as
sutton
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
depart
anna
and
agnes
cleared
the
table
just
been
telling
your
father
anna
said
sutton
when
anna
returned
to
the
room
sutton
and
myself
and
beatrice
are
going
to
the
isle
of
man
soon
for
a
fortnight
or
so
and
we
should
very
much
like
you
to
come
with
us
anna
heart
began
to
beat
violently
though
she
knew
there
was
no
hope
for
her
this
then
doubtless
was
the
main
object
of
visit
but
i
could
really
said
anna
scarcely
aware
what
she
did
say
not
asked
sutton
the
house
house
agnes
could
see
to
what
little
housekeeping
your
father
would
want
the
schools
will
break
up
next
week
do
these
young
folks
want
holidays
for
tellwright
inquired
with
philosophic
gruffness
never
had
one
and
what
more
i
thank
ye
for
one
i
pig
on
at
bursley
when
ye
gotten
a
roof
of
your
own
where
the
sense
o
going
elsewhere
and
pigging
we
really
want
anna
to
go
sutton
went
on
is
very
anxious
about
it
beatrice
is
very
short
of
suitable
friends
should
na
ha
thought
it
said
tellwright
seems
to
know
everyone
she
is
sutton
insisted
think
as
you
better
leave
anna
out
this
year
said
the
miser
stubbornly
anna
wished
profoundly
that
sutton
would
abandon
the
futile
attempt
then
she
perceived
that
the
visitor
was
signalling
to
her
to
leave
the
room
anna
obeyed
going
into
the
kitchen
to
give
an
eye
to
agnes
who
was
washing
up
all
right
said
sutton
contentedly
when
anna
returned
to
the
parlour
father
has
consented
to
your
going
with
us
it
is
very
kind
of
him
for
i
sure
he
miss
you
anna
sat
down
limp
speechless
she
could
not
believe
the
news
are
awfully
good
she
said
to
sutton
in
the
lobby
as
the
latter
was
leaving
the
house
ever
so
grateful
you
ca
think
and
she
threw
her
arms
round
sutton
neck
agnes
ran
up
to
say
sutton
kissed
the
child
will
be
the
little
housekeeper
eh
the
little
housekeeper
was
almost
as
pleased
at
the
prospect
of
housekeeping
as
if
she
too
had
been
going
to
the
isle
of
man
both
be
at
the
next
tuesday
i
suppose
sutton
said
holding
agnes
by
the
hand
agnes
glanced
at
her
sister
in
inquiry
do
know
anna
replied
shall
see
the
truth
was
that
not
caring
to
ask
her
father
for
the
money
for
the
tickets
she
had
given
no
thought
to
the
i
tell
you
that
henry
mynors
will
most
likely
come
with
us
to
the
isle
of
man
said
sutton
from
the
gate
anna
retired
to
her
bedroom
to
savour
an
astounding
happiness
in
quietude
at
supper
the
miser
was
in
a
mood
not
unbenevolent
she
expected
a
reaction
the
next
morning
but
ephraim
strange
to
say
remained
innocuous
she
ventured
to
ask
him
for
the
money
for
the
treat
tickets
two
shillings
he
made
no
immediate
reply
half
an
hour
afterwards
he
ejaculated
i
th
name
o
fortune
dost
thee
want
wi
agnes
she
answered
course
agnes
ca
go
alone
in
the
end
he
threw
down
a
florin
he
became
perilous
for
the
rest
of
the
day
but
the
florin
was
an
indisputable
fact
in
anna
pocket
the
was
held
in
a
field
near
sneyd
the
seat
of
a
marquis
and
a
saturday
afternoon
resort
very
popular
in
the
five
towns
the
children
were
formed
at
noon
on
duck
bank
into
a
procession
which
marched
to
the
railway
station
to
the
singing
of
we
gather
at
the
river
thence
a
special
train
carried
them
in
seething
compartments
excited
and
strident
to
sneyd
where
there
had
been
two
sharp
showers
in
the
morning
the
procession
was
reformed
along
a
country
road
and
the
vacillating
sky
threatened
more
rain
but
because
the
sun
had
shone
dazzlingly
at
eleven
all
the
women
and
girls
too
easily
tempted
by
the
glory
of
the
moment
blossomed
forth
in
pale
blouses
and
parasols
the
chattering
crowd
bright
and
defenceless
as
flowers
made
at
sneyd
a
picture
at
once
gay
and
pathetic
it
had
rained
there
at
twelve
the
roads
were
wet
and
among
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
children
and
thirty
teachers
there
were
less
than
a
score
umbrellas
the
excursion
was
theoretically
in
charge
of
titus
price
the
senior
superintendent
but
this
dignitary
had
failed
to
arrive
on
duck
bank
and
mynors
had
taken
his
place
in
the
train
anna
heard
that
some
one
had
seen
price
wearing
a
large
grey
wideawake
leap
into
the
guard
van
at
the
very
instant
of
departure
he
had
not
been
at
school
on
the
previous
sunday
and
anna
was
somewhat
perturbed
at
the
prospect
of
meeting
the
man
who
had
defined
her
letter
to
him
as
unique
in
the
whole
of
his
business
career
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
grey
wideawake
on
the
platform
at
sneyd
and
steered
her
own
scholars
so
as
to
avoid
its
vicinity
but
on
the
march
to
the
field
titus
reviewed
the
procession
and
she
was
obliged
to
meet
his
eyes
and
return
his
salutation
the
look
of
the
man
was
a
shock
to
her
he
seemed
thinner
nervous
restless
preoccupied
and
terribly
careworn
except
the
new
brilliant
hat
all
his
summer
clothes
were
soiled
and
shabby
it
was
as
though
he
had
forced
himself
out
of
regard
for
appearances
to
attend
the
fête
but
had
left
his
thoughts
in
edward
street
his
uneasy
and
hollow
cheerfulness
was
painful
to
watch
anna
realised
the
intensity
of
the
crisis
through
which
price
was
passing
she
perceived
in
a
single
glance
more
clearly
than
she
could
have
done
after
a
hundred
interviews
with
the
young
and
unresponsible
william
however
distressing
these
might
be
that
titus
must
for
weeks
have
been
engaged
in
a
truly
frightful
struggle
his
face
was
a
proof
of
the
tragic
sincerity
of
william
appeals
to
herself
and
to
her
father
that
price
should
have
contrived
to
pay
seventy
pounds
of
rent
in
a
little
more
than
a
month
seemed
to
her
imperfectly
acquainted
alike
with
ephraim
ruthless
compulsions
and
with
the
financial
jugglery
often
practised
by
debtors
to
be
an
almost
miraculous
effort
after
honesty
her
conscience
smote
her
for
conniving
at
which
she
now
saw
to
be
a
persecution
she
felt
as
sorry
for
titus
as
she
had
felt
for
his
son
the
obese
man
with
his
reputation
in
rags
about
him
was
acutely
wistful
in
her
eyes
as
a
child
might
have
been
a
carriage
rolled
by
raising
the
dust
in
places
where
the
strong
sun
had
already
dried
the
road
it
was
sutton
landau
driven
by
barrett
beatrice
in
white
sat
solitary
amid
cushions
while
two
large
hampers
occupied
most
of
the
coachman
box
the
carriage
seemed
to
move
with
lordly
ease
and
rapidity
and
the
teachers
already
weary
and
fretted
by
the
endless
pranks
of
the
children
bitterly
envied
the
enthroned
maid
who
nodded
and
smiled
to
them
with
such
charming
condescension
it
was
a
social
triumph
for
beatrice
she
disappeared
ahead
like
a
goddess
in
a
cloud
and
scarcely
a
woman
who
saw
her
from
the
humble
level
of
the
roadway
but
would
have
married
a
satyr
to
be
able
to
do
as
beatrice
did
later
when
the
field
was
reached
and
the
children
bursting
through
the
gate
had
spread
like
a
flood
over
the
daisied
grass
the
landau
was
to
be
seen
drawn
up
near
the
refreshment
tent
barrett
was
unpacking
the
hampers
which
contained
delicate
creamy
confectionery
for
the
teachers
tea
beatrice
explained
that
these
were
her
mother
gift
and
that
she
had
driven
down
in
order
to
preserve
the
fragile
pasties
from
the
risks
of
a
railway
journey
gratitude
became
vocal
and
beatrice
success
was
perfected
then
the
more
conscientious
teachers
set
themselves
seriously
to
the
task
of
amusing
the
smaller
children
and
the
smaller
children
consented
to
be
amused
according
to
the
recipes
appointed
by
long
custom
for
many
which
invariably
comprised
singing
or
kissing
being
thus
annually
resuscitated
by
elderly
people
from
the
deeps
of
memory
were
preserved
for
a
posterity
which
otherwise
would
never
have
known
them
among
these
was
for
years
titus
price
had
played
at
with
the
infant
classes
at
the
and
this
year
he
was
bound
by
the
expectations
of
all
to
continue
the
practice
another
diversion
which
he
always
took
care
to
organise
was
the
race
for
boys
also
he
usually
joined
in
the
a
quaint
game
which
owes
its
surprising
longevity
to
the
fact
that
it
is
equally
proper
for
both
sexes
within
half
an
hour
the
treat
was
in
full
career
football
cricket
rounders
tick
and
transformed
the
field
into
a
vast
arena
of
complicated
struggles
and
emulations
all
were
occupied
except
a
few
of
the
women
and
older
girls
who
strolled
languidly
about
in
the
of
spectators
the
sun
shone
generously
on
scores
of
vivid
and
frail
toilettes
and
parasols
made
hemispheres
of
glowing
colour
against
the
rich
green
of
the
grass
all
around
were
yellow
cornfields
and
meadows
where
cows
of
a
burnished
brown
indolently
meditated
upon
the
phenomena
of
a
every
hedge
and
ditch
and
gate
and
stile
was
in
that
ideal
condition
of
plenary
correctness
which
denotes
that
a
great
landowner
is
exhibiting
the
beauties
of
scientific
farming
for
the
behoof
of
his
villagers
the
sky
of
an
intense
blue
was
a
sea
in
which
large
white
clouds
sailed
gently
but
capriciously
on
the
northern
horizon
a
low
range
of
smoke
marked
the
sinister
region
of
the
five
towns
you
come
and
help
with
the
bags
and
cups
henry
mynors
asked
anna
she
was
standing
by
herself
watching
agnes
at
play
with
some
other
girls
mynors
had
evidently
walked
across
to
her
from
the
refreshment
tent
which
was
at
the
opposite
extremity
of
the
field
in
her
eyes
he
was
once
more
the
exemplar
of
style
his
suit
of
grey
flannel
his
white
straw
hat
became
him
to
admiration
he
stood
at
ease
with
his
hands
in
his
and
smiled
contentedly
all
he
said
tea
is
the
principal
thing
and
although
it
wants
two
hours
to
yet
it
as
well
to
be
beforehand
should
like
something
to
do
anna
replied
are
you
he
said
familiarly
after
this
abrupt
opening
and
then
shook
hands
they
traversed
the
field
together
with
many
deviations
to
avoid
trespassing
upon
areas
of
play
the
flapping
refreshment
tent
seemed
to
be
full
of
piles
of
baskets
and
piles
of
bags
and
piles
of
cups
which
the
contractor
had
brought
in
a
waggon
some
teachers
were
already
beginning
to
put
the
paper
bags
into
the
baskets
each
bag
contained
currant
cake
an
and
a
at
the
far
end
of
the
tent
beatrice
sutton
was
arranging
her
dainties
on
a
small
along
quick
anna
she
exclaimed
taste
my
tarts
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
them
i
do
hope
the
good
people
will
enjoy
them
and
then
turning
to
mynors
are
you
seeing
after
the
bags
and
things
i
thought
that
was
always
willie
price
favourite
job
it
is
said
mynors
unfortunately
he
is
here
that
pray
i
never
knew
him
miss
a
before
price
told
me
they
could
both
be
away
from
the
works
just
now
very
busy
i
suppose
william
would
have
been
more
use
than
his
father
anyhow
hush
mynors
murmured
with
a
subdued
laugh
beatrice
was
in
one
of
her
moods
as
she
herself
called
them
mynors
arrangements
for
the
prompt
distribution
of
tea
at
the
appointed
hour
were
very
minute
and
involved
a
considerable
amount
of
back
bending
and
manual
labour
but
though
they
were
enlivened
by
frequent
intervals
of
gossip
and
by
excursions
into
the
field
to
observe
this
and
that
amusing
sight
all
was
finished
half
an
hour
before
time
will
go
and
warn
price
said
mynors
is
quite
capable
of
forgetting
the
clock
mynors
left
the
tent
and
proceeded
to
the
scene
of
an
athletic
meeting
at
which
titus
price
in
was
distributing
prizes
of
sixpences
and
pennies
the
famous
race
had
just
been
run
anna
followed
at
a
saunter
and
shortly
afterwards
beatrice
overtook
her
great
titus
looks
better
than
he
did
when
he
came
on
the
field
beatrice
remarked
and
indeed
the
superintendent
had
put
on
quite
a
merry
appearance
flushed
excited
and
jocular
in
his
elephantine
way
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
not
a
care
in
the
world
the
boys
crowded
appreciatively
round
him
but
this
was
his
last
hour
of
joy
willie
price
here
anna
exclaimed
perceiving
william
in
the
fringe
of
the
crowd
the
lanky
fellow
stood
hesitatingly
his
left
hand
busy
with
his
moustache
he
is
said
beatrice
wonder
what
that
means
titus
had
not
observed
the
newcomer
but
henry
mynors
saw
william
and
exchanged
a
few
words
with
him
then
mynors
advanced
into
the
crowd
and
spoke
to
price
who
glanced
quickly
round
at
his
son
the
girls
at
a
distance
of
forty
yards
could
discern
the
swift
change
in
the
man
demeanour
in
a
second
he
had
reverted
to
the
deplorable
titus
of
three
hours
ago
he
elbowed
his
way
roughly
to
william
getting
into
his
coat
as
he
went
the
pair
talked
william
glanced
at
his
watch
and
in
another
moment
they
were
leaving
the
field
henry
mynors
had
to
finish
the
prize
distribution
so
much
anna
and
beatrice
plainly
saw
others
too
had
not
been
blind
to
this
sudden
and
dramatic
departure
it
aroused
universal
comment
among
the
teachers
must
be
wrong
at
price
works
beatrice
said
willie
has
had
to
fetch
his
papa
this
was
the
conclusion
of
all
the
gossips
beatrice
added
has
mentioned
price
several
times
lately
now
i
think
of
it
anna
grew
extremely
and
uncomfortable
she
felt
as
though
all
were
saying
of
her
goes
the
oppressor
of
the
poor
she
was
fairly
sure
however
that
her
father
was
not
responsible
for
this
particular
incident
there
must
then
be
other
implacable
creditors
she
had
been
thoroughly
enjoying
the
afternoon
but
now
her
pleasure
ceased
the
treat
ended
disastrously
in
the
middle
of
the
children
meal
while
yet
the
enormous
were
being
carried
up
and
down
the
thirsty
rows
and
the
boys
were
causing
their
bags
to
explode
with
appalling
detonations
it
began
to
rain
sharply
the
fickle
sun
withdrew
his
splendour
from
the
toilettes
and
was
seen
no
more
for
a
week
afterwards
come
at
last
ejaculated
mynors
who
had
watched
the
sky
with
anxiety
for
an
hour
previously
he
mobilised
the
children
and
ranked
them
under
a
row
of
elms
the
teachers
running
to
the
tent
for
their
own
tea
said
to
one
another
that
the
shower
could
only
be
a
brief
one
the
wish
was
father
to
the
thought
for
they
were
a
little
ashamed
to
be
under
cover
while
their
charges
precariously
sheltered
beneath
dripping
trees
yet
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
the
men
took
turns
in
the
rain
to
keep
the
children
in
their
places
the
sky
was
completely
overcast
set
in
for
a
wet
evening
and
so
we
may
as
well
make
the
best
of
it
beatrice
said
grimly
and
she
sent
the
landau
home
empty
she
was
right
a
forlorn
and
disgusted
snake
of
a
procession
crawled
through
puddles
to
the
station
the
platform
resounded
with
sneezes
none
but
a
dressmaker
could
have
discovered
a
silver
lining
to
the
black
and
cloud
which
had
ruined
so
many
dozens
of
fair
costumes
anna
melancholy
and
taciturn
exerted
herself
to
minimise
the
discomfort
of
her
scholars
a
word
from
mynors
would
have
been
balm
to
her
but
mynors
the
general
of
a
routed
army
was
parleying
by
telephone
with
the
of
the
railway
for
the
expediting
of
the
special
train
nearly
meet
in
class
a
gathering
for
the
exchange
of
religious
counsel
and
experience
chapter
x
the
isle
about
this
time
anna
was
not
seeing
very
much
of
henry
mynors
at
twenty
a
man
is
rash
in
love
and
again
perhaps
at
fifty
a
man
of
enamoured
of
a
young
girl
is
capable
of
sublime
follies
but
the
man
of
thirty
who
loves
for
the
first
time
is
usually
the
embodiment
of
cautious
discretion
he
does
not
fall
in
love
with
a
violent
descent
but
rather
lets
himself
gently
down
continually
testing
the
rope
his
social
value
especially
if
he
have
achieved
worldly
success
is
at
its
highest
and
without
conceit
he
is
aware
of
it
he
has
lost
many
illusions
concerning
women
he
has
seen
more
than
one
friend
wrecked
in
the
sea
of
foolish
marriage
he
knows
the
joys
of
a
bachelor
freedom
without
having
wearied
of
them
he
perceives
risks
where
the
youth
perceives
only
ecstasy
and
the
oldster
only
a
blissful
release
from
solitude
instead
of
searching
he
is
sought
for
accordingly
he
is
selfish
and
exacting
all
these
things
combine
to
tranquillize
passion
at
thirty
mynors
was
in
love
with
anna
and
his
love
had
its
ardent
moments
but
in
the
main
it
was
a
temperate
affection
an
affection
that
walked
circumspectly
with
its
eyes
open
careful
of
its
dignity
too
proud
to
seem
in
a
hurry
if
by
impulse
it
chanced
now
and
then
to
leap
forward
the
involuntary
movement
was
mastered
and
checked
mynors
called
at
manor
terrace
once
a
week
never
on
the
same
day
of
the
week
nor
without
discussing
business
with
the
miser
occasionally
he
accompanied
anna
from
school
or
chapel
such
methods
were
precisely
to
anna
taste
like
him
she
loved
prudence
and
decorum
preferring
to
make
haste
slowly
since
the
revival
they
had
only
once
talked
together
intimately
on
that
sole
occasion
henry
had
suggested
to
her
that
she
might
care
to
join
sutton
class
which
met
on
monday
nights
she
accepted
the
hint
with
pleasure
and
found
a
well
of
spiritual
inspiration
in
modest
and
simple
yet
fervent
homilies
mynors
was
not
guilty
of
blowing
both
hot
and
cold
she
was
sure
of
him
she
waited
calmly
for
events
existing
as
her
habit
was
in
the
future
the
future
then
meant
the
isle
of
man
anna
dreamed
of
an
enchanted
isle
and
hours
of
unimaginable
rapture
for
a
whole
week
after
sutton
had
won
ephraim
consent
her
vision
never
stooped
to
practical
details
then
beatrice
called
to
see
her
it
was
the
morning
after
the
treat
and
anna
was
brushing
her
muddy
frock
she
wore
a
large
white
apron
and
held
a
in
her
hand
as
she
opened
the
door
busy
said
beatrice
said
anna
come
in
come
into
the
kitchen
do
you
mind
beatrice
was
covered
from
neck
to
heel
with
a
long
mackintosh
which
she
threw
off
when
entering
the
kitchen
else
in
the
house
she
asked
said
anna
smiling
as
beatrice
seated
herself
with
a
sigh
of
content
on
the
table
let
talk
then
beatrice
drew
from
her
pocket
the
indispensable
chocolates
and
offered
them
to
anna
say
was
last
night
perfectly
awful
henry
got
wet
through
in
the
end
and
mother
made
him
stop
at
our
house
as
he
was
at
the
trouble
to
take
me
home
did
you
see
him
go
down
this
morning
why
said
anna
stiffly
no
reason
only
i
thought
perhaps
you
did
i
simply
ca
tell
you
how
glad
i
am
that
you
coming
with
us
to
the
isle
of
man
we
shall
have
rare
fun
we
go
every
year
you
know
to
port
erin
a
lovely
little
fishing
village
all
the
fishermen
know
us
there
last
year
henry
hired
a
yacht
for
the
fortnight
and
we
all
went
every
day
except
sometimes
now
and
then
pa
had
a
tendency
to
go
fiddling
in
caves
and
things
i
do
hope
it
will
be
fine
weather
again
by
then
do
you
looking
forward
to
it
i
can
tell
you
anna
said
day
are
we
supposed
to
start
week
soon
anna
was
surprised
at
the
proximity
of
the
event
and
quite
late
enough
too
we
should
start
earlier
only
the
dad
always
makes
out
he
ca
men
always
pretend
to
be
so
frightfully
busy
and
i
believe
it
all
put
on
beatrice
continued
to
chat
about
the
holiday
and
then
of
a
sudden
she
asked
are
you
going
to
wear
anna
repeated
and
added
with
hesitation
suppose
one
will
want
some
new
clothes
just
a
few
now
let
me
advise
you
take
a
blue
serge
skirt
wo
harm
it
and
if
it
dark
enough
it
will
look
well
to
any
mortal
blouse
secondly
you
ca
have
too
many
blouses
always
useful
at
the
seaside
plain
are
my
tip
a
coat
for
nights
and
thick
boots
there
of
course
no
one
ever
at
port
erin
it
is
like
llandudno
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
you
do
have
to
meet
your
young
man
on
the
pier
because
there
is
a
pier
there
was
a
pause
anna
did
not
know
what
to
say
at
length
she
ventured
not
much
for
clothes
as
i
dare
say
you
noticed
think
you
always
look
nice
my
dear
beatrice
responded
nothing
was
said
as
to
anna
wealth
no
reference
made
as
to
the
discrepancy
between
that
and
the
style
of
her
garments
by
a
fiction
there
was
supposed
to
be
no
discrepancy
you
make
your
own
frocks
beatrice
asked
later
you
know
i
thought
you
did
but
they
do
you
great
credit
few
people
can
make
a
plain
frock
look
decent
this
conversation
brought
anna
with
a
shock
to
the
level
of
earth
she
perceived
only
too
well
a
point
which
she
had
not
hitherto
fairly
faced
in
her
idyllic
meditations
that
her
father
was
still
a
factor
in
the
case
since
sutton
visit
both
anna
and
the
miser
avoided
the
subject
of
the
holiday
ca
have
too
many
blouses
did
beatrice
then
have
blouses
by
the
dozen
a
coat
a
serge
skirt
straw
hats
how
many
the
catalogue
frightened
her
she
began
to
suspect
that
she
would
not
be
able
to
go
to
the
isle
of
man
me
going
with
suttons
to
the
isle
of
man
she
accosted
her
father
in
the
afternoon
outwardly
calm
but
with
secret
trembling
he
exclaimed
savagely
shall
want
some
money
a
little
she
would
have
given
much
not
to
have
added
that
but
it
came
out
of
itself
a
waste
o
time
and
money
that
what
i
call
it
i
ca
think
why
suttons
asked
ye
ye
are
ill
are
ye
his
savagery
changed
to
sullenness
father
but
as
it
arranged
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
go
i
none
so
set
up
with
the
idea
mysen
you
be
all
right
with
agnes
yes
shall
be
all
right
do
want
much
no
fads
and
how
long
art
going
to
be
away
do
know
did
sutton
tell
you
you
arranged
it
i
didna
her
said
nowt
to
me
anyhow
i
shall
want
some
clothes
for
art
naked
must
have
some
money
her
voice
shook
she
was
getting
near
tears
thou
gotten
thy
own
money
hast
na
i
want
is
that
you
shall
let
me
have
some
of
my
own
money
there
forty
odd
pounds
now
in
the
bank
he
repeated
sneering
ye
want
is
as
i
shall
let
thee
have
some
o
thy
own
money
and
there
forty
odd
pound
i
the
bank
oh
you
give
me
my
out
of
the
bureau
and
i
draw
a
cheque
i
know
how
to
she
had
conquered
the
instinct
to
cry
and
unwillingly
her
tones
became
somewhat
peremptory
ephraim
seized
the
chance
i
wo
give
ye
the
out
o
th
bureau
he
said
flatly
i
thank
ye
for
less
sauce
that
finished
the
episode
proudly
she
took
an
oath
with
herself
not
to
the
question
and
resolved
to
write
a
note
to
sutton
saying
that
on
consideration
she
found
it
impossible
to
go
to
the
isle
of
man
the
next
morning
there
came
to
anna
a
letter
from
the
secretary
of
a
limited
company
enclosing
a
order
for
ten
pounds
some
weeks
previously
her
father
had
discovered
an
error
of
that
amount
in
the
deduction
of
from
the
dividend
paid
by
this
company
and
had
instructed
anna
to
demand
the
sum
she
had
obeyed
and
then
forgotten
the
affair
here
was
the
answer
desperate
at
the
thought
of
missing
the
holiday
she
cashed
the
order
bought
and
made
her
clothes
in
secret
and
then
two
days
before
the
arranged
date
of
departure
told
her
father
what
she
had
done
he
was
enraged
but
since
his
anger
was
too
illogical
to
be
rendered
effectively
coherent
in
words
he
had
the
wit
to
keep
silence
with
bitterness
anna
reflected
that
she
owed
her
holiday
to
the
merest
accident
for
if
the
remittance
had
arrived
a
little
earlier
or
a
little
later
or
in
the
form
of
a
cheque
she
could
not
have
utilised
it
it
was
an
incredible
day
the
following
saturday
a
warm
and
benign
day
of
earliest
autumn
the
suttons
in
a
hired
cab
called
for
anna
at
eight
on
the
way
to
the
main
line
station
at
shawport
anna
tin
box
was
flung
on
to
the
roof
of
the
cab
amid
the
trunks
and
portmanteaux
already
there
should
not
agnes
ride
with
us
to
the
station
beatrice
suggested
nay
there
no
room
said
tellwright
who
stood
at
the
door
impelled
by
an
unacknowledged
awe
of
sutton
thus
to
give
official
sanction
to
anna
departure
yes
sutton
exclaimed
the
little
thing
come
mr
tellwright
agnes
far
more
excited
than
any
of
the
rest
seized
her
straw
hat
and
slipping
the
elastic
under
her
small
chin
sprang
into
the
cab
and
found
a
haven
between
sutton
short
fat
legs
the
driver
drew
his
whip
smartly
across
the
aged
neck
of
the
cream
mare
they
were
off
what
a
rumbling
jolting
delicious
journey
down
the
first
hill
up
duck
bank
through
the
and
down
the
steep
declivity
of
oldcastle
street
silent
and
shy
agnes
smiled
ecstatically
at
the
others
anna
answered
remarks
in
a
dream
she
was
conscious
only
of
present
happiness
and
happy
expectation
all
bitterness
had
disappeared
at
least
thirty
thousand
bursley
folk
were
not
going
to
the
isle
of
man
that
day
their
preoccupied
and
cheerless
faces
swam
in
a
continuous
stream
past
the
cab
window
and
anna
sympathised
with
every
unit
of
them
her
spirit
overflowed
with
universal
compassion
what
haste
and
exquisite
confusion
at
the
station
the
train
was
signalled
and
the
porter
crossing
the
line
with
the
luggage
ran
his
truck
perilously
under
the
very
buffers
of
the
incoming
engine
mynors
was
awaiting
them
admirably
attired
as
a
tourist
he
had
got
the
tickets
and
secured
a
private
compartment
in
the
for
liverpool
and
he
found
time
to
arrange
with
the
cabman
to
drive
agnes
home
on
the
certainly
there
was
none
like
mynors
from
the
footboard
of
the
carriage
anna
bent
down
to
kiss
agnes
the
child
had
been
laughing
and
chattering
suddenly
as
anna
lips
touched
hers
she
burst
into
tears
sobbed
passionately
as
though
overtaken
by
some
terrible
and
unexpected
misfortune
tears
stood
also
in
anna
eyes
the
sisters
had
never
been
parted
before
little
thing
sutton
murmured
and
beatrice
told
her
father
to
give
agnes
a
shilling
to
buy
chocolates
at
stevenson
in
square
that
being
the
best
shop
the
shilling
fell
between
the
footboard
and
the
platform
a
scream
from
beatrice
the
attendant
porter
promised
to
rescue
the
shilling
in
due
course
the
engine
whistled
the
guard
asserted
his
authority
mynors
leaped
in
and
amid
laughter
and
tears
the
brief
and
unique
joy
of
anna
life
began
in
a
moment
so
it
seemed
the
train
was
thundering
through
the
mile
of
solid
rock
which
ends
at
lime
street
station
liverpool
thenceforward
till
she
fell
asleep
that
night
anna
existed
in
a
state
of
blissful
bewilderment
stupefied
by
an
overdose
of
novel
and
wondrous
sensations
they
lunched
in
amazing
magnificence
at
the
bear
paw
and
then
walked
through
the
crowded
and
prodigious
streets
to
prince
the
luggage
had
disappeared
by
some
mysterious
agency
mynors
said
that
they
would
find
it
safe
at
douglas
but
anna
could
not
banish
the
fear
that
her
tin
box
had
gone
for
ever
the
great
wavy
river
churned
by
thousands
of
keels
the
monstrous
steamer
the
isle
whose
side
rose
like
solid
wall
out
of
the
water
the
vistas
of
its
decks
its
vast
saloons
story
under
story
solid
and
palatial
could
all
this
float
its
high
bridge
its
hawsers
as
thick
as
trees
its
funnels
like
sloping
towers
the
multitudes
of
passengers
the
whistles
hoots
cries
the
panorama
of
wharves
and
docks
the
squat
carrying
horses
and
carts
and
no
one
looking
twice
at
the
feat
it
was
all
too
much
too
astonishing
too
lovely
she
had
not
guessed
at
this
call
liverpool
the
slum
of
europe
said
mynors
can
you
she
exclaimed
shocked
beatrice
seeing
her
radiant
and
rapt
face
walked
to
and
fro
with
anna
proud
of
the
effect
produced
on
her
friend
inexperience
by
these
sights
one
might
have
thought
that
beatrice
had
built
liverpool
and
created
its
trade
by
her
own
efforts
suddenly
the
and
all
the
people
on
it
moved
away
bodily
from
the
ship
there
was
green
water
between
a
tremor
like
that
of
an
earthquake
ran
along
the
deck
handkerchiefs
were
waved
the
voyage
had
commenced
mynors
found
chairs
for
all
the
suttons
and
tucked
them
up
on
the
of
a
but
anna
did
not
stir
they
passed
new
brighton
seaforth
and
the
crosby
and
formby
lightships
and
view
the
ship
said
mynors
at
her
side
we
go
round
and
inspect
things
a
bit
a
very
big
one
is
it
she
asked
big
he
said
course
not
as
big
as
the
atlantic
liners
i
wonder
we
did
meet
one
in
the
river
but
still
pretty
big
three
hundred
and
twenty
feet
over
all
i
sailed
on
her
last
year
on
her
maiden
voyage
she
was
packed
and
the
weather
very
bad
it
be
rough
anna
inquired
timidly
if
it
keeps
like
this
he
laughed
do
feel
queer
do
you
no
it
as
firm
as
a
house
no
one
could
be
ill
with
this
they
he
exclaimed
could
be
they
descended
into
the
ship
and
he
explained
all
its
internal
economy
with
a
knowledge
that
seemed
to
her
encyclopædic
they
stayed
a
long
time
watching
the
engines
so
titanic
ruthless
and
deliberate
even
the
smell
of
the
oil
was
pleasant
to
anna
when
they
came
on
deck
again
the
ship
was
at
sea
for
the
first
time
anna
beheld
the
ocean
a
strong
breeze
blew
from
prow
to
stern
yet
the
sea
was
absolutely
calm
the
unruffled
mirror
of
effulgent
sunlight
the
steamer
moved
alone
on
the
waters
exultantly
leaving
behind
it
an
endless
track
of
white
froth
in
the
green
and
the
shadow
of
its
smoke
the
sun
the
salt
breeze
the
living
water
the
proud
gaiety
of
the
ship
produced
a
feeling
of
intense
inexplicable
joy
a
profound
satisfaction
with
the
present
and
a
negligence
of
past
and
future
to
exist
was
enough
then
as
anna
and
henry
leaned
over
the
starboard
quarter
and
watched
the
torrent
of
foam
rush
madly
and
ceaselessly
from
under
the
to
be
swallowed
up
in
the
white
wake
the
spectacle
of
the
wild
torrent
almost
hypnotised
them
destroying
thought
and
reason
and
all
sense
of
their
relation
to
other
things
with
difficulty
anna
raised
her
eyes
and
perceived
the
dim
receding
line
of
the
lancashire
coast
we
get
quite
out
of
sight
of
land
she
asked
for
a
little
while
about
half
an
hour
or
so
just
as
much
out
of
sight
of
land
as
if
we
were
in
the
middle
of
the
atlantic
can
scarcely
believe
it
what
the
idea
of
that
of
being
out
of
sight
of
land
nothing
but
sea
when
at
last
it
occurred
to
them
to
reconnoitre
the
suttons
they
found
all
three
still
in
their
enwrapped
and
languid
sutton
and
beatrice
were
apparently
dozing
this
part
of
the
deck
was
occupied
by
somnolent
basking
figures
wake
them
sutton
enjoined
whispering
out
of
her
hood
anna
glanced
curiously
at
beatrice
yellow
face
away
do
beatrice
exclaimed
opening
her
eyes
and
shutting
them
again
wearily
so
they
went
away
and
discovered
two
empty
on
the
anna
was
innocently
vain
of
her
immunity
from
mynors
appeared
to
appoint
himself
little
errands
about
the
deck
returning
frequently
to
his
chair
over
there
can
you
see
anything
anna
ran
to
the
rail
with
the
infantile
idea
of
getting
nearer
and
mynors
followed
laughing
what
looked
like
a
small
cloud
lay
on
the
horizon
seem
to
see
something
she
said
is
the
isle
of
man
by
insensible
gradations
the
contours
of
the
land
grew
clearer
in
the
afternoon
haze
far
are
we
off
now
twenty
miles
twenty
miles
of
uninterrupted
flatness
and
the
ship
steadily
invading
that
separating
solitude
yard
by
yard
furlong
by
furlong
the
conception
awed
her
there
a
morsel
in
the
waste
of
the
deep
a
speck
under
the
infinite
sunlight
lay
the
island
mysterious
enticing
enchanted
a
glinting
jewel
on
the
sea
bosom
a
remote
entity
fraught
with
strange
secrets
it
was
all
unspeakable
you
have
covered
yourself
with
glory
said
sutton
when
they
were
in
the
diminutive
and
absurd
train
which
by
breathless
plunges
annihilates
the
sixteen
miles
between
douglas
and
port
erin
in
minutes
i
she
answered
not
being
always
the
beginner
luck
said
beatrice
pale
and
dishevelled
they
all
relapsed
into
the
silence
of
fatigue
it
was
growing
dusk
when
the
train
stopped
at
the
tiny
terminus
the
station
was
a
hive
of
bustling
activity
the
arrival
of
this
train
being
the
daily
event
at
that
end
of
the
world
mynors
and
the
suttons
were
greeted
familiarly
by
several
sailors
and
one
of
these
tom
kelly
a
tall
man
with
grey
beard
small
grey
eyes
a
wrinkled
skin
of
red
mahogany
and
an
enormous
fist
was
introduced
to
anna
he
raised
his
cap
and
shook
hands
she
was
touched
by
the
sad
kind
look
on
his
face
the
melancholy
impress
of
the
sea
then
they
drove
to
their
lodging
and
here
again
the
party
was
welcomed
as
being
old
and
tried
friends
a
fire
was
burning
in
the
parlour
throwing
herself
down
in
front
of
it
sutton
breathed
last
oh
for
some
tea
through
the
window
anna
had
a
glimpse
of
a
deeply
indented
bay
at
the
foot
of
cliffs
below
them
with
a
bold
headland
to
the
right
fishing
vessels
with
flat
red
sails
seemed
to
hang
undecided
just
outside
the
bay
from
cottage
chimneys
beneath
the
road
blue
smoke
softly
ascended
all
went
early
to
bed
for
the
weariness
of
and
sutton
seemed
to
communicate
itself
to
the
three
young
people
who
might
otherwise
have
gone
forth
into
the
village
in
search
of
adventures
anna
and
beatrice
shared
a
room
each
inspected
the
other
clothes
and
beatrice
made
anna
try
on
the
new
serge
skirt
through
the
thin
wall
came
the
sound
of
and
sutton
talking
a
high
voice
then
a
bass
reply
in
continual
alternation
beatrice
said
that
these
two
always
discussed
the
day
doings
in
such
manner
in
a
few
moments
beatrice
was
snoring
she
had
the
subdued
but
steady
and
serious
snore
characteristic
of
some
muscular
men
anna
felt
no
inclination
to
sleep
she
lived
again
hour
by
hour
through
the
day
and
beneath
beatrice
snore
her
ear
caught
the
undertone
of
the
sea
the
next
morning
was
as
lovely
as
the
last
it
was
sunday
and
every
activity
of
the
village
was
stilled
sea
and
land
were
equally
folded
in
a
sunlit
calm
during
breakfast
a
meal
abundant
in
fresh
herrings
fresh
eggs
and
fresh
rolls
eaten
with
the
window
wide
open
anna
was
puzzled
by
the
singular
amenity
of
her
friends
to
one
another
and
to
her
they
were
as
polite
as
though
they
had
been
strangers
they
chatted
amiably
were
full
of
goodwill
and
as
anxious
to
give
happiness
as
to
enjoy
it
she
thought
at
first
so
unusual
was
it
to
her
as
a
feature
of
domestic
privacy
that
this
demeanour
was
affected
or
at
any
rate
a
somewhat
exaggerated
punctilio
due
to
her
presence
but
she
soon
came
to
see
that
she
was
mistaken
after
breakfast
sutton
suggested
that
they
should
attend
the
wesleyan
chapel
on
the
hill
leading
to
the
chasms
here
they
met
the
sailors
of
the
night
before
arrayed
now
in
marvellous
blue
melton
coats
with
velveteen
collars
tom
kelly
walked
back
with
them
to
the
beach
and
showed
them
the
yacht
which
mynors
had
arranged
to
hire
for
it
lay
on
the
sands
speckless
in
new
white
paint
all
the
afternoon
they
dozed
on
the
cliffs
doing
nothing
whatever
for
this
sunday
was
tacitly
regarded
not
as
part
of
the
holiday
but
as
a
preparation
for
the
holiday
all
felt
that
the
holiday
with
its
proper
exertions
and
appointed
delights
would
really
begin
on
monday
morning
us
go
for
a
walk
said
mynors
after
tea
to
beatrice
and
anna
they
stood
at
the
gate
of
the
the
old
people
were
resting
within
two
go
beatrice
replied
looking
at
anna
know
i
hate
walking
henry
i
stop
with
mother
and
dad
throughout
the
day
anna
had
been
conscious
of
the
fact
that
all
the
suttons
showed
a
tendency
slight
but
perceptible
to
treat
henry
and
herself
as
a
pair
desirous
of
opportunities
for
being
alone
together
she
did
not
like
it
she
flushed
under
the
passing
glance
with
which
beatrice
accompanied
the
words
two
go
nevertheless
when
mynors
placidly
remarked
well
and
his
eyes
sought
hers
for
a
consent
she
could
not
refuse
it
one
part
of
her
nature
would
have
preferred
to
find
an
excuse
for
staying
at
home
but
another
and
a
stronger
part
insisted
on
seizing
this
offered
joy
they
walked
straight
up
out
of
the
village
toward
the
high
which
stretches
peak
after
peak
from
port
erin
to
peel
the
stony
and
devious
lanes
wound
about
the
bleak
hillside
passing
here
and
there
small
solitary
cottages
of
whitewashed
stone
with
children
fowls
and
dogs
at
the
doors
all
embowered
in
huge
fuchsia
trees
presently
they
had
surmounted
the
limit
of
habitation
and
were
on
the
naked
flank
of
bradda
following
a
narrow
track
which
crept
upwards
amid
short
mossy
turf
of
the
most
vivid
green
nothing
seemed
to
flourish
on
this
exposed
height
except
bracken
sheep
and
boulders
that
from
a
distance
resembled
sheep
there
was
no
tree
scarcely
a
shrub
the
immense
contours
stark
grim
and
unrelieved
rose
in
melancholy
and
defiant
majesty
against
the
sky
the
hand
of
man
could
coax
no
harvest
from
these
smooth
but
obdurate
slopes
they
had
never
relented
and
they
would
never
relent
the
spirit
was
braced
by
the
thought
that
here
to
the
furthest
eternity
of
civilisation
more
and
more
intricate
simple
and
strong
souls
would
always
find
solace
and
repose
mynors
bore
to
the
left
for
a
while
striking
across
the
moor
in
the
direction
of
the
sea
then
he
said
down
now
the
little
bay
lay
like
an
oblong
five
hundred
feet
below
them
the
surface
of
the
water
was
like
glass
the
strand
with
its
phalanx
of
boats
drawn
up
in
sabbath
tidiness
glittered
like
marble
in
the
living
light
and
over
this
marble
black
dots
moved
slowly
to
and
fro
behind
the
boats
were
the
houses
dolls
houses
each
with
a
curling
wisp
of
smoke
further
away
the
railway
and
the
high
road
ran
out
in
a
black
and
white
line
to
port
mary
the
sea
a
pale
grey
encompassed
all
the
southern
sky
had
a
faint
sapphire
tinge
rising
to
delicate
azure
the
sight
of
this
haven
at
rest
shut
in
by
the
restful
sea
and
by
great
moveless
hills
a
calm
within
a
calm
aroused
profound
emotion
lovely
said
anna
as
they
stood
gazing
tears
came
to
her
eyes
and
hung
there
she
wondered
that
scenery
should
cause
tears
felt
ashamed
and
turned
her
face
so
that
mynors
should
not
see
but
he
had
seen
we
go
on
to
the
top
he
suggested
and
they
set
their
faces
northwards
to
climb
still
higher
at
length
they
stood
on
the
rocky
summit
of
bradda
seven
hundred
feet
from
the
sea
the
hill
of
the
night
watch
lifted
above
them
to
the
north
but
on
east
south
and
west
the
prospect
was
bounded
only
by
the
ocean
the
was
revealed
for
thirty
miles
from
peel
to
castletown
far
to
the
east
was
castletown
bay
large
shallow
and
inhospitable
its
floor
strewn
with
a
thousand
unseen
wrecks
the
lighthouse
at
scarlet
point
flashed
dimly
in
the
dusk
thence
the
beach
curved
nearer
in
an
immense
arc
without
a
sign
of
life
to
the
little
cove
of
port
mary
and
jutted
out
again
into
a
tongue
of
land
at
the
end
of
which
lay
the
calf
of
man
with
its
single
white
cottage
and
the
dangerous
calf
sound
where
the
vexed
tide
is
forced
to
run
nine
hours
one
way
and
three
the
other
seemed
like
a
grey
ribbon
and
the
chicken
rock
like
a
tiny
pencil
on
a
vast
slate
port
erin
was
hidden
under
their
feet
they
looked
westward
the
darkening
sky
was
a
labyrinth
of
purple
and
crimson
scarves
drawn
pellucid
as
though
by
the
finger
of
god
across
a
sheet
of
pure
saffron
these
decadent
tints
of
the
sunset
faded
in
every
direction
to
the
same
soft
azure
which
filled
the
south
and
one
star
twinkled
in
the
illimitable
field
thirty
miles
off
on
the
horizon
could
be
discerned
the
mourne
mountains
of
ireland
mynors
exclaimed
touching
her
arm
the
huge
disc
of
the
moon
was
rising
in
the
east
and
as
this
mild
lamp
passed
up
the
sky
the
sense
of
universal
quiescence
increased
lovely
anna
had
said
it
was
the
loveliest
sight
her
eyes
had
ever
beheld
a
panorama
of
pure
beauty
transcending
all
imagined
visions
it
overwhelmed
her
thrilled
her
to
the
heart
this
revelation
of
the
loveliness
of
the
world
her
thoughts
went
back
to
hanbridge
and
bursley
and
her
life
there
and
all
the
remembered
scenes
bathed
in
the
glow
of
a
new
ideal
seemed
to
lose
their
pain
it
was
as
if
she
had
never
been
really
unhappy
as
if
there
was
no
real
unhappiness
on
the
whole
earth
she
perceived
that
the
monotony
the
austerity
the
melancholy
of
her
existence
had
been
sweet
and
beautiful
of
its
kind
and
she
recalled
with
a
sort
of
rapture
hours
of
companionship
with
the
beloved
agnes
when
her
father
was
equable
and
pacific
nothing
was
ugly
nor
mean
beauty
was
everywhere
in
everything
in
silence
they
began
to
descend
perforce
walking
quickly
because
of
the
steep
gradient
at
the
first
cottage
they
saw
a
little
girl
in
a
playing
with
two
kittens
like
agnes
mynors
said
i
was
just
thinking
so
anna
answered
thought
of
her
up
on
the
hill
he
continued
will
miss
you
wo
she
know
she
cried
herself
to
sleep
last
night
you
might
guess
it
but
she
is
extremely
sensitive
guess
it
why
not
i
am
sure
she
is
do
you
know
i
am
very
fond
of
your
sister
she
a
simply
delightful
child
and
there
a
lot
in
her
too
she
so
quick
and
bright
and
somehow
like
a
little
woman
exactly
like
a
woman
sometimes
anna
agreed
i
fancy
she
a
great
deal
older
than
i
am
than
any
of
us
he
corrected
glad
you
like
her
anna
said
content
thinks
all
the
world
of
you
and
she
added
word
would
she
be
vexed
if
she
knew
i
had
told
you
that
this
appreciation
of
agnes
brought
them
into
closer
intimacy
and
they
talked
the
more
easily
of
other
things
will
freeze
mynors
said
and
then
suddenly
looking
at
her
in
the
twilight
are
feeling
chill
no
she
protested
you
are
put
this
muffler
round
your
neck
he
took
a
muffler
from
his
pocket
no
really
you
will
need
it
yourself
she
drew
a
little
away
from
him
as
if
to
avoid
the
muffler
take
it
she
did
so
and
thanked
him
tying
it
loosely
and
untidily
round
her
throat
that
feeling
of
the
untidiness
of
the
muffler
of
its
being
something
strange
to
her
skin
something
with
the
rough
virtue
of
masculinity
which
no
one
could
detect
in
the
gloom
was
in
itself
pleasant
wager
sutton
has
a
good
fire
burning
when
we
get
in
he
said
she
thought
with
joyous
anticipation
of
the
warm
bright
the
supper
and
the
vivacious
conversation
though
the
walk
was
nearly
at
an
end
other
delights
were
in
store
of
the
holiday
thirteen
complete
days
yet
remained
each
to
be
as
happy
as
the
one
now
closing
it
was
an
age
at
last
they
entered
the
human
cosiness
of
the
village
as
they
walked
up
the
steps
of
their
lodging
and
he
opened
the
door
for
her
she
quickly
drew
off
the
muffler
and
returned
it
to
him
with
a
word
of
thanks
on
monday
morning
when
beatrice
and
anna
came
downstairs
they
found
the
breakfast
odorously
cooling
on
the
table
and
nobody
in
the
room
are
they
all
i
wonder
any
letters
beatrice
said
your
mother
out
on
the
front
and
mynors
too
beatrice
threw
up
the
window
and
called
along
henry
come
along
mother
everything
going
cold
it
mynors
cheerfully
replied
out
here
both
of
you
and
begin
the
day
properly
with
a
dose
of
ozone
loathe
cold
bacon
said
beatrice
glancing
at
the
table
and
they
went
out
into
the
road
where
sutton
kissed
them
with
as
much
fervour
as
if
they
had
arrived
from
a
long
journey
look
pale
anna
she
remarked
i
said
anna
do
feel
pale
that
long
walk
last
night
beatrice
put
in
always
goes
too
far
do
anna
began
but
at
that
moment
sutton
lumbering
and
ponderous
joined
the
party
he
said
without
greeting
anyone
noticed
those
houses
down
the
road
yonder
by
the
falcon
i
been
having
a
chat
with
kelly
and
he
tells
me
the
fellow
that
was
building
them
has
gone
bankrupt
and
they
at
a
the
receiver
wants
to
sell
in
fact
kelly
says
they
going
cheap
i
believe
they
be
a
good
spec
dear
sutton
interrupted
him
i
wish
you
would
leave
your
specs
alone
when
you
on
your
holiday
missis
he
affectionately
protested
and
continued
fairly
well
built
seemingly
and
the
rafters
are
on
the
roof
anna
he
turned
to
her
quickly
as
if
counting
on
her
sympathy
must
come
with
me
and
look
at
after
breakfast
happen
they
might
suit
your
father
or
you
i
know
your
father
fond
of
a
good
spec
she
assented
with
a
ready
smile
this
was
the
beginning
of
a
fancy
which
the
alderman
always
afterwards
showed
for
anna
after
breakfast
sutton
beatrice
and
anna
arranged
to
go
shopping
brass
sutton
ejaculated
in
two
monosyllables
to
her
husband
much
will
content
ye
he
asked
mildly
me
five
or
ten
pounds
to
go
on
with
he
opened
the
front
pocket
of
his
trousers
a
pocket
which
fastened
with
a
button
and
leaning
back
in
his
chair
drew
out
a
fat
purse
and
passed
it
to
his
wife
with
a
preoccupied
air
she
helped
herself
and
then
beatrice
intercepted
the
purse
and
lightened
it
of
half
a
sovereign
beatrice
said
ruined
the
alderman
eyes
requested
anna
to
observe
how
he
was
robbed
at
last
the
purse
was
safely
buttoned
up
again
sutton
purchases
of
food
at
the
three
principal
shops
of
the
village
seemed
startlingly
profuse
to
anna
but
gradually
she
became
accustomed
to
the
scale
and
to
the
amazing
habit
of
always
buying
the
very
best
of
everything
from
beefsteak
to
grapes
anna
calculated
that
the
housekeeping
could
not
cost
less
than
six
pounds
a
week
for
the
five
at
manor
terrace
three
people
existed
on
a
pound
with
her
beatrice
bought
a
belt
and
a
pair
of
and
some
cigarettes
for
henry
sutton
bought
a
pipe
with
a
nickel
cap
such
as
is
used
by
sailors
when
they
returned
to
the
house
sutton
and
henry
were
smoking
on
the
front
all
five
walked
in
a
row
down
to
the
harbour
the
alderman
giving
an
arm
each
to
beatrice
and
anna
near
the
the
procession
had
to
be
stopped
in
order
to
view
the
unfinished
houses
tom
kelly
had
a
cabin
partly
excavated
out
of
the
rock
behind
the
little
quay
here
they
found
him
entangled
amid
nets
sails
and
oars
all
crowded
into
the
cabin
and
shook
hands
with
its
owner
who
remarked
with
severity
on
their
pallid
faces
and
insisted
that
a
change
of
complexion
must
be
brought
about
mynors
offered
him
his
but
on
seeing
the
light
colour
of
the
tobacco
he
shook
his
head
and
refused
it
at
the
same
time
taking
from
within
his
jersey
a
lump
of
something
that
resembled
leather
him
this
henry
sutton
whispered
handing
mynors
the
pipe
which
she
had
bought
sutton
wishes
you
to
accept
this
said
mynors
thank
ye
he
exclaimed
a
leddy
that
knows
my
taste
he
cut
some
shreds
from
his
plug
with
a
and
charged
and
lighted
the
pipe
filling
the
cabin
with
asphyxiating
fumes
do
know
how
you
can
smoke
such
horrid
nasty
stuff
said
beatrice
coughing
he
laughed
condescendingly
at
beatrice
petulant
manner
stuff
of
henry
is
boy
tobacco
he
said
shortly
it
was
decided
that
they
should
go
fishing
in
the
there
was
a
light
southerly
breeze
a
cloudy
sky
and
smooth
water
under
charge
of
young
tom
kelly
a
sheepish
lad
of
sixteen
with
his
father
smile
they
all
got
into
an
inconceivably
small
dinghy
loading
it
down
till
it
was
almost
awash
old
tom
himself
helped
anna
to
embark
told
her
where
to
tread
and
forced
her
gently
into
a
seat
at
the
stern
no
one
else
seemed
to
be
disturbed
but
anna
was
in
a
state
of
desperate
fear
she
had
never
committed
herself
to
a
boat
before
and
the
little
waves
spat
up
against
the
sides
in
a
most
alarming
way
as
young
tom
jerked
the
dinghy
along
with
the
short
sculls
she
went
white
and
clung
in
silence
fiercely
to
the
gunwale
in
a
few
moments
they
were
tied
up
to
the
which
seemed
very
big
and
safe
in
comparison
with
the
dinghy
they
clambered
on
board
and
in
the
deep
well
of
the
yacht
anna
contrived
to
collect
her
wits
she
was
reassured
by
the
painted
legend
in
the
well
to
carry
eleven
young
tom
and
henry
busied
themselves
with
ropes
and
suddenly
a
huge
white
sail
began
to
ascend
the
mast
it
flapped
like
thunder
in
the
gentle
breeze
tom
pulled
up
the
anchor
curling
the
chain
round
and
round
on
the
forward
deck
and
then
anna
noticed
that
although
the
wind
was
scarcely
perceptible
they
were
gliding
quickly
past
the
embankment
henry
was
at
the
tiller
the
next
minute
tom
had
set
the
jib
and
by
this
time
the
was
approaching
the
breakwater
at
a
great
pace
there
was
no
rolling
or
pitching
but
simply
a
smooth
swift
progression
over
the
calm
surface
anna
thought
it
the
ideal
of
locomotion
as
soon
as
they
were
beyond
the
breakwater
and
the
sails
caught
the
breeze
from
the
sound
the
lay
over
as
if
shot
and
a
little
column
of
green
water
flung
itself
on
the
lee
coaming
of
the
well
anna
screamed
as
she
saw
the
water
and
felt
the
angle
of
the
floor
suddenly
change
but
when
everyone
laughed
she
laughed
too
henry
noticing
the
whiteness
of
her
knuckles
as
she
gripped
the
coaming
explained
the
disconcerting
phenomena
anna
tried
to
be
at
ease
but
she
was
not
she
could
not
for
a
long
time
dismiss
the
suspicion
that
all
these
people
were
foolishly
blind
to
a
peril
which
she
alone
had
the
sagacity
to
perceive
they
cruised
about
while
tom
prepared
the
lines
the
short
waves
chopped
cheerfully
against
the
carvel
sides
of
the
yacht
the
clouds
were
breaking
at
a
hundred
points
the
sea
grew
lighter
in
tone
gaiety
was
in
the
air
no
one
could
possibly
be
indisposed
in
that
innocuous
weather
at
length
the
lines
were
ready
but
tom
said
the
yacht
was
making
at
least
a
knot
too
much
for
serious
fishing
so
henry
took
a
reef
in
the
mainsail
showing
anna
how
to
tie
the
short
strings
the
alderman
lying
on
the
was
placidly
smoking
the
lines
were
thrown
out
astern
and
sutton
and
beatrice
each
took
one
but
they
had
no
success
young
tom
said
it
was
because
the
sun
had
appeared
anything
sutton
inquired
at
intervals
after
a
time
he
said
anna
and
i
have
a
try
it
was
agreed
must
i
do
asked
anna
brave
now
just
hold
the
line
so
and
if
you
feel
a
little
that
a
mackerel
these
were
the
instructions
of
beatrice
anna
was
becoming
excited
she
had
not
held
the
line
ten
seconds
before
she
cried
out
got
one
said
beatrice
thinks
at
first
that
the
motion
of
the
waves
against
the
line
is
a
fish
said
henry
giving
the
tiller
to
young
tom
haul
in
and
see
anyway
before
doing
so
he
held
the
line
for
a
moment
testing
it
and
winked
at
anna
while
anna
and
henry
were
hauling
in
the
alderman
dropping
his
pipe
began
also
to
haul
in
his
own
line
with
great
fury
one
father
sutton
asked
both
lines
came
in
together
and
on
each
was
a
pounder
anna
saw
her
fish
gleam
and
flash
like
silver
in
the
clear
water
as
it
neared
the
surface
henry
held
the
line
short
letting
the
mackerel
plunge
and
jerk
and
then
seized
and
unhooked
the
catch
cruel
anna
cried
startled
at
the
nearness
of
the
two
fish
as
they
sprang
about
in
an
old
sugar
box
at
her
feet
young
tom
laughed
loud
at
her
exclamation
cair
feel
miss
he
sniggered
anna
wondered
that
a
mouth
so
soft
and
kind
could
utter
such
heartless
words
in
an
hour
the
united
efforts
of
the
party
had
caught
nine
mackerel
it
was
not
a
multitude
but
the
sun
in
perfecting
the
weather
had
spoilt
the
sport
anna
had
ceased
to
commiserate
the
captured
fish
she
was
obliged
however
to
avert
her
head
when
tom
cut
some
skin
from
the
side
of
one
of
the
mackerel
to
provide
fresh
bait
this
device
seemed
to
her
the
extremest
refinement
of
cruelty
beatrice
grew
ominously
silent
and
inert
and
sutton
glanced
first
at
her
daughter
and
then
at
her
husband
the
latter
nodded
happen
better
be
getting
back
henry
said
the
alderman
the
swept
home
like
a
bird
they
were
at
the
quay
and
kelly
was
dragging
them
one
by
one
from
the
black
dinghy
on
to
what
the
alderman
called
henry
had
the
fish
on
a
string
many
did
ye
catch
miss
tellwright
kelly
asked
benevolently
caught
four
anna
replied
never
before
had
she
felt
so
proud
elated
and
boisterous
never
had
the
blood
so
wildly
danced
in
her
veins
she
looked
at
her
short
blue
skirt
which
showed
three
inches
of
ankle
put
forward
her
foot
like
a
vain
coquette
and
darted
a
covert
look
at
henry
when
he
caught
it
she
laughed
instead
of
blushing
doing
well
tom
kelly
approved
make
a
famous
five
of
the
mackerel
were
given
to
young
tom
the
other
four
preceded
a
fowl
in
the
menu
of
dinner
they
were
called
anna
mackerel
and
all
the
diners
agreed
that
better
mackerel
had
never
been
lured
out
of
the
irish
sea
in
the
afternoon
the
alderman
and
his
wife
slept
as
usual
sutton
with
a
bandanna
handkerchief
over
his
face
the
rest
went
out
immediately
the
invitation
of
the
sun
and
the
sea
was
far
too
persuasive
to
be
resisted
going
to
paint
said
beatrice
with
a
resolute
mien
want
to
paint
bradda
head
frightfully
i
tried
last
year
but
i
got
it
too
dark
somehow
i
improved
since
then
what
are
you
going
to
do
come
and
watch
you
said
henry
no
you
wo
at
least
you
wo
you
such
a
critic
anna
can
if
she
likes
and
me
be
left
all
afternoon
by
myself
suppose
you
go
with
him
anna
just
to
keep
him
from
being
bored
anna
hesitated
once
more
she
had
the
uncomfortable
suspicion
that
mynors
and
herself
were
being
manoeuvred
here
said
mynors
to
beatrice
you
decided
absolutely
to
paint
the
finality
of
the
answer
seemed
to
have
a
touch
of
resentment
he
turned
to
anna
go
and
get
that
dinghy
and
row
about
the
bay
eh
she
could
offer
no
rational
objection
and
they
were
soon
putting
off
from
the
jetty
impelled
seaward
by
a
mighty
push
from
kelly
arm
it
was
very
hot
mynors
wore
white
flannels
he
removed
his
coat
and
turned
up
his
sleeves
showing
thick
hairy
arms
he
sculled
in
a
manner
almost
dramatic
and
the
dinghy
shot
about
like
a
on
a
brook
anna
had
nothing
to
do
except
to
sit
still
and
enjoy
everything
was
drowned
in
dazzling
sunlight
and
both
henry
and
anna
could
feel
the
process
of
tanning
on
their
faces
the
bay
shimmered
with
a
million
diamond
points
it
was
impossible
to
keep
the
eyes
open
without
frowning
and
soon
anna
could
see
the
beads
of
sweat
on
crimson
brow
she
said
this
was
the
first
word
of
conversation
he
merely
smiled
in
reply
presently
they
were
at
the
other
side
of
the
bay
in
a
cave
whose
sandy
and
floor
trembled
clear
under
a
fathom
of
blue
water
they
landed
on
a
jutting
rock
henry
pushed
his
straw
hat
back
and
wiped
his
forehead
glorious
he
exclaimed
you
swim
no
you
should
get
beatrice
to
teach
you
i
swam
out
here
this
morning
at
seven
it
was
chilly
enough
then
oh
i
forgot
i
told
you
at
breakfast
she
could
see
him
in
the
translucent
water
swimming
with
long
powerful
strokes
dozens
of
boats
were
moving
lazily
in
the
bay
each
with
a
cargo
of
parasols
a
good
deal
of
the
sunshade
afloat
he
remarked
have
you
got
one
you
get
as
brown
as
tom
kelly
what
i
want
she
said
at
yourself
in
the
water
there
he
said
pointing
to
a
little
pool
left
on
the
top
of
the
rock
by
the
tide
she
did
so
and
saw
two
fiery
cheeks
and
a
forehead
divided
by
a
horizontal
line
into
halves
of
white
and
crimson
the
tip
of
the
nose
was
blistered
it
disgraceful
he
suggested
she
exclaimed
never
know
me
when
i
get
home
it
was
in
such
wise
that
they
talked
endlessly
exchanging
trifles
of
comment
anna
thought
to
herself
this
it
could
not
be
she
decided
but
she
infinitely
preferred
it
so
she
was
content
she
wished
for
nothing
better
than
this
apparently
frivolous
and
irresponsible
dalliance
she
felt
that
if
mynors
were
to
be
tender
sentimental
and
serious
she
would
become
wretchedly
they
and
skirting
the
shore
gradually
came
round
to
the
beach
up
above
them
on
the
cliffs
they
could
discern
the
industrious
figure
of
beatrice
with
easel
and
and
all
the
panoply
of
the
earnest
amateur
you
sketch
she
asked
him
i
he
said
scornfully
you
believe
in
that
sort
of
thing
then
all
right
for
professional
artists
he
said
who
can
paint
but
well
i
suppose
it
harmless
for
the
amateurs
finds
them
something
to
do
wish
i
could
paint
anyway
she
retorted
glad
you
ca
he
insisted
when
they
got
back
to
the
cliffs
towards
beatrice
was
still
painting
but
in
a
new
spot
she
seemed
entirely
absorbed
in
her
work
and
did
not
hear
their
approach
creep
up
and
surprise
her
mynors
whispered
go
first
and
put
your
hands
over
her
eyes
exclaimed
beatrice
blindfolded
horrid
you
are
henry
i
know
who
it
is
i
know
who
it
is
just
do
then
said
henry
now
in
front
of
her
anna
removed
her
hands
you
told
her
to
do
it
i
sure
of
that
and
i
was
getting
on
so
splendidly
i
sha
do
another
stroke
now
right
said
henry
wasted
quite
enough
time
as
it
is
beatrice
pouted
she
was
evidently
annoyed
with
both
of
them
she
looked
from
one
to
the
other
jealous
of
their
mutual
understanding
and
agreement
and
sutton
issued
from
the
house
and
the
five
stood
chatting
till
tea
was
ready
but
the
shadow
remained
on
beatrice
face
mynors
made
several
attempts
to
laugh
it
away
and
at
dusk
these
two
went
for
a
stroll
to
port
mary
they
returned
in
a
state
of
deep
intimacy
during
supper
beatrice
was
consciously
and
elaborately
angelic
and
there
was
that
in
her
voice
and
eyes
when
sometimes
she
addressed
mynors
which
almost
persuaded
anna
that
he
might
once
have
loved
his
cousin
at
night
in
the
bedroom
anna
imagined
that
she
could
detect
in
beatrice
attitude
the
least
shade
of
condescension
she
felt
hurt
and
despised
herself
for
feeling
hurt
so
the
days
passed
without
much
variety
for
the
suttons
were
not
addicted
to
excursions
anna
was
profoundly
happy
she
had
forgotten
care
she
agreed
to
every
suggestion
for
amusement
each
moment
had
its
pleasure
and
this
pleasure
was
quite
independent
of
the
thing
done
it
sprang
from
all
activities
and
idlenesses
she
was
at
special
pains
to
fraternise
with
sutton
he
made
an
interesting
companion
full
of
facts
about
strata
outcrops
and
breaks
his
sole
weakness
being
the
habit
of
quoting
extremely
sentimental
scraps
of
verse
when
walking
by
the
he
frankly
enjoyed
anna
attention
to
him
and
took
pride
in
her
society
sutton
that
simple
heart
devoted
herself
to
the
attainment
of
absolute
quiescence
she
had
come
for
a
rest
and
she
achieved
her
purpose
her
kindliness
became
for
the
time
passive
instead
of
active
beatrice
was
a
changing
quantity
in
the
domestic
equation
plainly
her
parents
had
spoiled
their
only
child
and
she
had
frequent
fits
of
petulance
particularly
with
mynors
but
her
energy
and
spirits
atoned
well
for
these
as
for
mynors
he
behaved
exactly
as
on
the
first
monday
he
spent
many
hours
alone
with
anna
beatrice
appeared
to
insist
on
leaving
them
together
even
while
showing
a
faint
resentment
at
the
loneliness
thus
entailed
on
herself
and
his
attitude
was
such
as
anna
ignorant
of
the
ways
of
brothers
deemed
a
brother
might
adopt
on
the
second
monday
an
incident
occurred
in
the
afternoon
sutton
had
asked
beatrice
to
go
with
him
to
port
mary
and
she
had
refused
on
the
plea
that
the
light
was
of
a
suitable
grey
for
painting
sutton
had
slipped
off
alone
unseen
by
anna
and
henry
who
had
meant
to
accompany
him
in
place
of
beatrice
before
tea
while
anna
beatrice
and
henry
were
awaiting
the
meal
in
the
parlour
mynors
referred
to
the
matter
hope
you
done
some
decent
work
this
afternoon
he
said
to
beatrice
have
she
replied
shortly
have
done
a
stroke
you
said
you
were
going
to
paint
hard
i
did
why
could
you
have
gone
to
port
mary
instead
of
breaking
your
fond
father
heart
by
a
refusal
did
want
me
really
anna
interjected
think
he
did
bee
know
you
very
not
to
say
selfish
mynors
said
i
not
beatrice
protested
seriously
i
anna
anna
tried
to
think
of
a
diplomatic
pronouncement
beatrice
took
offence
at
the
hesitation
you
two
are
bound
to
agree
of
course
you
as
thick
as
thieves
she
gazed
steadily
out
of
the
window
and
there
was
a
silence
lip
curled
there
the
loveliest
yacht
just
coming
into
the
bay
beatrice
cried
suddenly
in
a
tone
of
affected
enthusiasm
going
out
to
sketch
it
she
snatched
up
her
hat
and
and
ran
hastily
from
the
room
the
other
two
saw
her
sitting
on
the
grass
sharpening
a
pencil
the
yacht
a
large
and
luxurious
craft
had
evidently
come
to
anchor
for
the
night
sutton
arrived
from
her
bedroom
and
then
sutton
also
came
in
tea
was
served
mynors
called
to
beatrice
through
the
window
and
received
no
reply
then
sutton
summoned
her
on
with
your
tea
beatrice
shouted
without
turning
her
head
wait
for
me
i
bound
to
finish
this
now
her
anna
dear
said
sutton
after
another
interval
anna
rose
to
obey
you
coming
in
bee
she
stood
by
the
sketcher
side
and
observed
nothing
but
a
few
meaningless
lines
on
the
block
you
hear
what
i
said
to
mother
anna
retired
in
discomfiture
tea
was
finished
they
went
out
but
kept
at
a
discreet
distance
from
the
artist
who
continued
to
use
her
pencil
until
dusk
had
fallen
then
they
returned
to
the
where
a
fire
had
been
lighted
and
beatrice
at
length
followed
as
the
others
sat
in
a
circle
round
the
fire
beatrice
who
occupied
the
sofa
in
solitude
gave
a
shiver
you
taken
cold
said
her
mother
sitting
out
there
like
that
nonsense
mother
what
a
fidget
you
are
fidget
i
certainly
am
not
my
darling
and
that
you
know
very
well
as
you
had
no
tea
you
shall
have
some
gruel
at
once
and
go
to
bed
and
get
warm
no
mother
but
sutton
was
resolved
and
in
half
an
hour
she
had
taken
beatrice
to
bed
and
tucked
her
up
when
anna
went
to
the
bedroom
beatrice
was
awake
you
sleep
she
inquired
kindly
said
beatrice
in
a
feeble
voice
restless
somehow
wonder
if
it
influenza
said
sutton
on
the
following
morning
when
she
learnt
from
anna
that
beatrice
had
had
a
bad
night
and
would
take
breakfast
in
bed
she
carried
the
invalid
food
upstairs
herself
hope
it
is
influenza
she
said
later
girl
is
very
hot
have
a
clinical
thermometer
mynors
suggested
see
if
you
can
buy
one
at
the
little
chemist
she
replied
eagerly
in
a
few
minutes
he
came
back
with
the
instrument
at
over
a
hundred
sutton
reported
having
used
the
thermometer
do
you
say
father
shall
we
send
for
a
doctor
i
not
so
set
up
with
doctors
as
a
general
rule
she
added
as
if
in
defence
to
anna
brought
beatrice
through
measles
and
scarlet
fever
without
a
doctor
we
never
used
to
think
of
having
a
doctor
in
those
days
for
ordinary
ailments
but
influenza
that
different
eh
i
dread
it
you
never
know
how
it
will
end
and
poor
beatrice
had
such
a
bad
attack
last
martinmas
you
like
i
run
for
a
doctor
now
said
mynors
be
till
the
alderman
decided
see
how
she
goes
on
happen
it
nothing
but
a
cold
assented
sutton
no
use
crying
out
before
hurt
anna
was
struck
by
the
placidity
with
which
they
covered
their
apprehension
towards
noon
beatrice
who
said
that
she
felt
better
insisted
on
rising
a
fire
was
lighted
at
once
in
the
parlour
and
she
sat
in
front
of
it
till
when
she
was
obliged
to
go
to
bed
again
on
the
wednesday
morning
after
a
night
which
had
been
almost
sleepless
for
both
girls
her
temperature
stood
at
and
henry
fetched
the
doctor
who
pronounced
it
a
case
of
influenza
severe
demanding
very
careful
treatment
instantly
the
normal
movement
of
the
household
was
changed
the
sickroom
became
a
mysterious
centre
round
which
everything
revolved
and
the
parlour
without
the
alteration
of
a
single
chair
took
on
a
deserted
forlorn
appearance
meals
were
eaten
like
the
passover
with
loins
girded
for
any
sudden
summons
sutton
and
anna
as
nurses
grew
important
in
the
eyes
of
the
men
who
instinctively
effaced
themselves
existing
only
like
whose
business
it
is
to
await
a
call
yet
there
was
no
alarm
flurry
nor
excitement
in
the
evening
the
doctor
returned
the
temperature
had
not
fallen
it
was
part
of
the
treatment
that
a
medicine
should
be
administered
every
two
hours
with
absolute
regularity
and
sutton
said
that
she
should
sit
up
through
the
night
shall
do
that
said
anna
i
wo
hear
of
it
sutton
replied
smiling
but
the
three
men
the
doctor
had
remained
to
chat
in
the
parlour
recognising
anna
capacity
and
reliability
and
perhaps
impressed
also
by
her
appearance
as
arrayed
in
a
white
apron
she
stood
with
firm
lips
before
them
gave
a
unanimous
decision
against
sutton
have
you
ill
next
lass
said
the
alderman
to
his
wife
that
never
do
sutton
surrendered
i
can
leave
her
to
anyone
anna
mynors
smiled
appreciatively
on
the
thursday
morning
there
was
still
no
sign
of
recovery
the
temperature
was
and
the
patient
slightly
delirious
anna
left
the
sickroom
at
eight
to
preside
at
breakfast
and
sutton
took
her
place
look
tired
my
dear
said
the
alderman
affectionately
feel
perfectly
well
she
replied
with
cheerfulness
you
are
afraid
of
catching
it
mynors
asked
she
said
no
fear
of
me
catching
it
do
you
know
know
that
all
i
never
the
right
way
to
keep
well
the
alderman
remarked
the
quiet
admiration
of
these
two
men
was
very
pleasant
to
her
she
felt
that
she
had
established
herself
for
ever
in
their
esteem
after
breakfast
in
obedience
to
them
she
slept
for
several
hours
on
sutton
bed
in
the
afternoon
beatrice
was
worse
the
doctor
called
and
found
her
temperature
at
ca
last
he
remarked
briefly
doctor
sutton
said
i
your
hands
sutton
murmured
with
a
smile
left
it
with
god
with
him
this
was
the
first
and
only
word
of
religion
except
grace
at
table
that
anna
heard
from
the
suttons
during
her
stay
in
the
isle
of
man
she
had
feared
lest
vocal
piety
might
form
a
prominent
feature
of
their
daily
life
but
her
fear
had
proved
groundless
she
too
from
reason
rather
than
instinct
had
tried
to
pray
for
beatrice
recovery
she
had
however
found
much
more
satisfaction
in
the
activity
of
nursing
again
that
night
she
sat
up
and
on
the
friday
morning
beatrice
was
better
at
noon
all
immediate
danger
was
past
the
patient
slept
her
temperature
was
almost
correct
anna
went
to
bed
in
the
afternoon
and
slept
soundly
till
when
she
awoke
very
hungry
for
the
first
time
in
three
days
beatrice
could
be
left
alone
the
other
four
had
supper
together
cheerful
and
relieved
after
the
tension
be
as
right
as
a
trivet
in
a
few
days
said
the
alderman
few
weeks
said
sutton
course
said
mynors
stay
on
here
now
shall
stay
until
beatrice
is
quite
fit
to
travel
sutton
answered

have
to
run
over
to
th
five
towns
for
a
day
or
two
middle
of
next
week
but
i
can
come
back
immediately
i

go
tomorrow
mynors
sighed

can
stay
over
sunday
henry
i
no
one
to
take
my
place
at
school
i
must
go
too
said
anna
suddenly
anna
the
alderman
protested
must
she
insisted
will
expect
me
you
know
i
came
for
a
fortnight
besides
there
agnes
will
be
all
right
must
go
they
saw
that
she
was
fixed
a
short
walk
do
you
good
mynors
suggested
to
her
with
singular
gravity
after
supper
not
been
outside
for
two
days
she
looked
inquiringly
at
sutton
take
her
henry
she
sleep
better
for
it
eh
anna
but
a
shame
to
send
you
home
with
those
rings
round
your
eyes
she
went
upstairs
for
a
jacket
beatrice
was
awake
she
exclaimed
in
a
weak
voice
without
any
preface
was
awfully
silly
and
cross
the
other
afternoon
before
all
this
business
just
now
when
you
came
into
the
room
i
was
feeling
quite
ashamed
bee
she
answered
bending
over
her
nonsense
now
go
off
to
sleep
at
once
she
was
very
happy
beatrice
victim
of
a
temperament
which
had
the
childishness
and
the
impulsiveness
of
the
artist
without
his
higher
and
sterner
traits
sank
back
in
facile
content
the
night
was
still
and
very
dark
when
anna
and
mynors
got
outside
they
could
distinguish
neither
the
sky
nor
the
sea
but
the
faint
restless
murmur
of
the
sea
came
up
the
cliffs
only
the
lights
of
the
houses
disclosed
the
direction
of
the
road
we
go
down
to
the
jetty
and
then
along
as
far
as
the
breakwater
he
said
and
she
concurred
you
take
my
muffler
again
he
added
pulling
this
article
from
his
pocket
thanks
she
said
almost
coldly
really
quite
warm
she
regarded
the
offer
of
the
muffler
as
an
indiscretion
his
sole
indiscretion
during
their
acquaintance
as
they
walked
down
the
hill
to
the
shore
she
though
how
beatrice
illness
had
sharply
interrupted
their
relations
if
she
had
come
to
the
isle
of
man
with
a
vague
idea
that
he
would
possibly
propose
to
her
the
expectation
was
disappointed
but
she
felt
no
disappointment
she
felt
that
events
had
lifted
her
to
a
higher
plane
than
that
of
she
was
filled
with
the
proud
satisfaction
of
a
duty
accomplished
she
did
not
seek
to
minimise
to
herself
the
fact
that
she
had
been
of
real
value
to
her
friends
in
the
last
few
days
had
probably
saved
sutton
from
illness
had
certainly
laid
them
all
under
an
obligation
their
gratitude
unexpressed
but
patent
on
each
face
gave
her
infinite
pleasure
she
had
won
their
respect
by
the
manner
in
which
she
had
risen
to
the
height
of
an
emergency
that
demanded
more
than
devotion
she
had
proved
not
merely
to
them
but
to
herself
that
she
could
be
calm
under
stress
and
could
exert
moral
force
when
occasion
needed
such
were
the
joyous
and
exultant
reflections
which
passed
through
her
brain
unnaturally
active
in
the
factitious
wakefulness
caused
by
excessive
fatigue
she
was
in
an
extremely
nervous
and
excitable
condition
and
never
guessed
it
fancying
indeed
that
her
emotions
were
exceptionally
tranquil
that
night
she
had
not
begun
to
realise
the
crisis
through
which
she
had
just
lived
the
uneven
road
to
the
ruined
breakwater
was
quite
deserted
having
reached
the
limit
of
the
path
they
stood
side
by
side
solitary
silent
gazing
at
the
black
and
gently
heaving
surface
of
the
sea
the
eye
was
foiled
by
the
intense
gloom
the
ear
could
make
nothing
of
the
strange
of
the
bay
and
the
ocean
beyond
but
the
imagination
was
stimulated
by
the
appeal
of
all
this
mystery
and
darkness
never
had
the
water
seemed
so
wonderful
terrible
and
austere
are
going
away
he
said
at
length
anna
started
and
shook
with
apprehension
at
the
tremor
in
his
voice
she
had
read
that
a
woman
was
always
well
warned
by
her
instincts
when
a
man
meant
to
propose
to
her
but
here
was
the
proposal
imminent
and
she
had
not
suspected
in
a
flash
of
insight
she
perceived
that
the
very
event
which
had
separated
them
for
three
days
had
also
impelled
the
lover
forward
in
his
course
it
was
the
thought
of
her
vigils
her
fortitude
her
compassion
that
had
fanned
the
flame
she
was
not
surprised
only
made
uncomfortable
when
he
took
her
hand
he
said
no
use
making
a
long
story
of
it
tremendously
in
love
with
you
you
know
i
am
he
stepped
back
still
holding
her
hand
she
could
say
nothing
he
ventured
you
know
thought
i
thought
she
murmured
stupidly
thought
you
liked
me
ca
tell
you
how
i
admire
you
i
not
going
to
praise
you
to
your
face
but
i
simply
never
met
anyone
like
you
from
the
very
first
moment
i
saw
you
it
was
the
same
it
something
in
your
face
anna
anna
will
you
be
my
wife
the
actual
question
was
put
in
a
precise
polite
somewhat
conventional
tone
to
anna
he
was
never
more
himself
than
at
that
moment
she
could
not
speak
she
could
not
analyse
her
feelings
she
could
not
even
think
she
was
adrift
at
last
she
stammered
only
known
each
other
dear
he
exclaimed
masterfully
does
that
matter
if
it
had
been
a
dozen
years
instead
of
one
that
would
have
made
no
difference
she
drew
her
hand
timidly
away
but
he
took
it
again
she
felt
that
he
dominated
her
and
would
decide
for
her
yes
she
said
she
saw
pictures
of
her
career
as
his
wife
and
resolved
that
one
of
the
first
acts
of
her
freedom
should
be
to
release
agnes
from
the
more
ignominious
of
her
father
tyrannies
they
walked
home
almost
in
silence
she
was
engaged
then
yet
she
experienced
no
new
sensation
she
felt
as
she
had
felt
on
the
way
down
except
that
she
was
sorely
perturbed
there
was
no
ineffable
rapture
no
ecstatic
bliss
suddenly
the
prospect
of
happiness
swept
over
her
like
a
flood
at
the
gate
she
wished
to
make
a
request
to
him
but
hesitated
because
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
use
his
christian
name
it
was
proper
for
her
to
use
his
christian
name
however
and
she
would
do
so
or
perish
she
said
tell
anyone
here
he
merely
kissed
her
once
more
she
went
straight
upstairs
chapter
xi
the
downfall
in
order
to
catch
the
liverpool
steamer
at
douglas
it
was
necessary
to
leave
port
erin
at
six
in
the
morning
the
freshness
of
the
morning
and
the
smiles
of
the
alderman
and
his
wife
as
they
waved
from
the
doorstep
filled
anna
with
a
serene
content
which
she
certainly
had
not
felt
during
the
wakeful
night
she
forgot
then
the
hours
passed
with
her
conscience
in
realising
how
serious
and
solemn
a
thing
was
this
engagement
made
in
an
instant
on
the
previous
evening
all
that
remained
in
her
mind
as
she
and
henry
walked
quickly
down
the
road
was
the
tonic
sensation
of
high
resolves
to
be
a
worthy
wife
the
duties
rather
than
the
joys
of
her
condition
had
lain
nearest
her
heart
until
that
moment
of
setting
out
giving
her
an
anxious
and
almost
worried
mien
which
at
breakfast
neither
henry
nor
the
suttons
could
quite
understand
but
now
the
idea
of
duty
ceased
for
a
time
to
be
paramount
and
she
loosed
herself
to
the
pleasures
of
the
day
in
store
the
harbour
was
full
of
low
wandering
mists
through
which
the
brown
sails
of
the
played
at
high
above
them
the
round
forms
of
immense
clouds
were
still
carrying
the
colours
of
sunrise
the
gentle
salt
wind
on
the
cheek
was
like
the
touch
of
a
it
was
impossible
on
such
a
morning
not
to
exult
in
life
not
to
laugh
childishly
from
irrational
glee
not
to
dismiss
the
memory
of
grief
and
the
apprehension
of
grief
as
morbid
hallucinations
mynor
face
expressed
the
double
happiness
of
present
and
anticipated
pleasure
he
had
once
again
succeeded
he
who
had
never
failed
and
the
voyage
back
to
england
was
for
him
a
triumphal
progress
anna
responded
eagerly
to
his
mood
the
day
was
an
ecstasy
a
bright
expanse
unstained
to
anna
in
particular
it
was
a
unique
day
marking
the
apogee
of
her
existence
in
the
years
that
followed
she
could
always
return
to
it
and
say
to
herself
day
i
was
happy
foolishly
ignorantly
but
utterly
and
all
that
i
have
since
learnt
can
not
alter
it
i
was
happy
when
they
reached
shawport
station
a
cab
was
waiting
for
anna
unknown
to
her
henry
had
ordered
it
by
telegraph
this
considerateness
was
of
a
piece
she
thought
with
his
masterly
conduct
of
the
entire
journey
on
the
steamer
at
liverpool
in
the
train
nothing
that
an
experienced
traveller
could
devise
had
been
lacking
to
her
comfort
she
got
into
the
cab
alone
while
mynors
followed
by
a
boy
and
his
bag
walked
to
his
rooms
in
mount
street
it
had
been
arranged
at
anna
wish
that
he
should
not
appear
at
manor
terrace
till
ephraim
opened
for
her
the
door
of
her
home
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
was
pleased
father
here
i
am
again
you
see
lass
they
shook
hands
and
she
indicated
to
the
cabman
where
to
deposit
her
she
was
glad
and
relieved
to
be
back
nothing
had
changed
except
herself
and
this
absolute
sameness
was
at
once
pleasant
and
pathetic
to
her
agnes
she
asked
smiling
at
her
father
in
the
glow
of
arrival
she
had
a
vague
notion
that
her
relations
with
him
had
been
permanently
softened
by
absence
see
thou
gotten
into
th
habit
o
flitting
about
in
cabs
he
said
without
answering
her
question
father
she
said
smiling
yet
was
the
box
i
carry
the
box
reckon
thou
couldst
ha
hired
a
lad
to
carry
it
for
sixpence
she
did
not
reply
the
cabman
had
gone
to
his
vehicle
going
to
pay
th
cabby
paid
him
father
much
she
paused
father
it
was
a
lie
she
had
paid
two
shillings
she
went
eagerly
into
the
kitchen
and
then
into
the
parlour
where
tea
was
set
for
one
agnes
was
not
there
upstairs
ephraim
said
meeting
anna
as
she
came
into
the
lobby
again
she
ran
softly
upstairs
and
into
the
bedroom
agnes
was
replacing
ornaments
on
the
mantelpiece
with
mathematical
exactitude
under
her
arm
was
a
duster
the
child
turned
startled
and
gave
a
little
shriek
i
did
know
you
come
how
early
you
are
they
rushed
towards
each
other
embraced
and
kissed
anna
was
overcome
by
the
pathos
of
her
sister
loneliness
in
that
grim
house
for
fourteen
days
while
she
the
elder
had
been
absorbed
in
selfish
gaiety
the
pale
face
large
melancholy
eyes
and
long
thin
arms
were
a
silent
accusation
she
wondered
that
she
could
ever
have
brought
herself
to
leave
agnes
even
for
a
day
sitting
down
on
the
bed
she
drew
the
child
on
her
knee
in
a
fury
of
love
and
kissed
her
again
weeping
agnes
cried
too
for
sympathy
my
dear
dear
anna
i
so
glad
you
come
back
she
dried
her
eyes
and
in
quite
a
different
tone
of
voice
asked
mynors
proposed
to
you
anna
could
not
avoid
a
blush
at
this
simple
and
astounding
query
she
said
it
was
the
one
word
of
which
she
was
capable
under
the
circumstances
that
was
not
the
moment
to
tax
agnes
with
too
much
precocity
and
abruptness
engaged
then
oh
anna
does
it
feel
nice
it
must
i
knew
you
would
be
did
you
know
agnes

knew
he

ask
you

time

the
girls
at
school

too
hope

did
talk
about

said
the
elder
sister
but

always
talking
about

told
me
that

did
like

agnes
after
thinking
a
moment
have
had
some
new
cups
and
saucers
up
from
mynors
works
and
father
has
swept
the
kitchen
chimney
and
oh
anna
i
asked
him
if

house
well
and
he
said
pretty
well
and
he
gave
me
a
penny

first
money
i
ever
had
you
know
i
wanted
you
at
nights
anna
and
all
the
time

the
kitchen
i
bring

to
you
in
the
parlour
had
my
tea
at
crewe
anna
was
about
to
say
but
refrained
in
due
course
drinking
the
cup
prepared
by
agnes
she
felt
passionately
sorry
for
agnes
too
young
to
feel
the
shadow
which
overhung
her
future
anna
would
marry
into
freedom
but
agnes
would
remain
the
serf
would
agnes
marry
could
she
would
her
father
allow
it
anna
had
noticed
that
in
families
the
youngest
petted
in
childhood
was
often
sacrificed
in
maturity
it
was
the
last
maid
who
must
keep
her
maidenhood
and
vicariously
filial
pay
out
of
her
own
life
the
debt
of
all
the
rest
mynors
is
coming
up
for
supper
he
wants
to
see
you
anna
said
to
her
father
as
calmly
as
she
could
the
miser
grunted
but
at
eight
the
hour
immutably
fixed
for
supper
henry
had
not
arrived
the
meal
proceeded
of
course
without
him
to
anna
his
absence
was
unaccountable
and
disturbing
for
none
could
be
more
punctilious
than
he
in
the
matter
of
appointments
she
expected
him
every
moment
but
he
did
not
appear
agnes
filled
full
of
the
great
secret
confided
to
her
was
more
openly
impatient
than
her
sister
neither
of
them
could
talk
and
a
heavy
silence
fell
upon
the
family
group
a
silence
which
her
father
on
that
particular
evening
of
return
resented
dunna
tell
us
much
he
remarked
when
the
supper
was
finished
she
felt
that
the
complaint
was
a
just
one
even
before
supper
when
nothing
had
occurred
to
preoccupy
her
she
had
spoken
little
there
had
seemed
so
much
to
tell
at
port
erin
and
now
there
seemed
nothing
to
tell
she
ventured
into
a
flaccid
perfunctory
account
of
beatrice
illness
of
the
fishing
of
the
unfinished
houses
which
had
caught
the
fancy
of
sutton
she
said
the
sea
had
been
smooth
that
they
had
had
something
to
eat
at
liverpool
that
the
train
for
crewe
was
very
prompt
and
then
she
could
think
of
no
more
silence
fell
again
the
were
cleared
away
and
washed
up
at
a
nine
agnes
vainly
begging
permission
to
stay
up
in
order
to
see
mynors
was
sent
to
bed
only
partially
comforted
by
a
long
desired
which
anna
had
brought
for
her
as
a
present
from
the
isle
of
man
you
tell
father
yourself
now
henry
has
come
the
child
asked
anna
who
had
gone
upstairs
to
unpack
her
box
said
anna
briefly
wonder
what
he
say
agnes
reflected
with
that
habit
always
annoying
to
anna
of
meeting
trouble
at
a
quarter
to
ten
anna
ceased
to
expect
mynors
and
finally
braced
herself
to
the
ordeal
of
a
solemn
interview
with
her
father
well
knowing
that
she
dared
not
leave
him
any
longer
in
ignorance
of
her
engagement
already
the
old
man
was
locking
and
bolting
the
door
he
had
wound
up
the
kitchen
clock
when
he
came
back
to
the
parlour
to
extinguish
the
gas
she
was
standing
by
the
mantelpiece
she
began
something
i
must
tell
you
what
that
ye
say
his
hand
was
on
the
he
dropped
it
examining
her
face
curiously
mynors
has
asked
me
to
marry
him
he
asked
me
last
night
we
settled
he
should
come
up
to
see
you
i
ca
think
why
he
has
it
must
be
something
very
unexpected
and
important
or
have
come
she
trembled
her
heart
beat
violently
but
the
words
were
out
and
she
thanked
god
ye
to
marry
him
did
he
the
miser
gazed
at
her
quizzically
out
of
his
small
blue
eyes
father
what
didst
say
said
i
would
thou
saidst
thou
wouldst
i
reckon
it
was
for
thatten
as
thou
must
go
gadding
off
to
seaside
eh
i
never
dreamt
of
such
a
thing
when
suttons
asked
me
to
go
i
do
wish
henry
the
cost
of
that
christian
name
come
he
quite
meant
to
come
she
could
not
help
insisting
on
the
propriety
of
henry
intentions
i
am
for
be
consulted
eh
course
father
soon
made
it
up
between
ye
his
tone
was
at
the
best
brusque
but
she
breathed
more
easily
divining
instantly
from
his
manner
that
he
meant
to
offer
no
violent
objection
to
the
engagement
she
knew
that
only
tact
was
needed
now
the
miser
had
indeed
foreseen
the
possibility
of
this
marriage
for
months
past
and
had
long
since
decided
in
his
own
mind
that
henry
would
make
a
satisfactory
ephraim
had
no
social
ambitions
with
all
his
meanness
he
was
above
them
he
had
nothing
but
contempt
for
rank
style
luxury
and
theory
of
what
it
is
to
be
a
lady
and
a
gentleman
yet
by
a
curious
contradiction
smartness
of
appearance
the
smartness
of
an
unrivalled
commercial
traveller
pleased
him
he
saw
in
henry
a
young
and
sedate
man
of
remarkable
shrewdness
a
man
who
had
saved
money
had
made
money
for
others
and
was
now
making
it
for
himself
a
man
who
could
be
trusted
absolutely
to
perform
that
feat
of
on
a
and
profoundly
respectable
man
at
the
same
time
audacious
and
imperturbable
he
was
well
aware
that
henry
had
really
fallen
in
love
with
anna
but
nothing
would
have
convinced
him
that
anna
money
was
not
the
primal
cause
of
henry
genuine
passion
for
anna
self
like
henry
do
you
father
anna
said
it
was
a
failure
in
the
desired
tact
for
ephraim
had
never
been
known
to
admit
that
he
liked
anyone
or
anything
such
natures
are
capable
of
nothing
more
positive
than
toleration
a
chap
and
he
knows
the
value
o
money
ay
that
he
does
he
knows
which
side
his
bread
buttered
on
a
sinister
emphasis
marked
the
last
sentence
instead
of
remaining
silent
anna
in
her
nervousness
committed
another
imprudence
do
you
mean
father
she
asked
pretending
that
she
thought
it
impossible
he
could
mean
what
he
obviously
did
mean
knows
what
i
at
lass
dost
think
he
isna
marrying
thee
for
thy
brass
dost
think
as
he
canna
make
a
fine
guess
what
worth
but
that
wunna
bother
thee
as
long
as
hooked
a
chap
thou
mayst
bridle
but
it
true
dunna
tell
me
securely
conscious
of
the
perfect
purity
of
mynors
affection
she
was
not
in
the
least
hurt
she
even
thought
that
her
father
attitude
was
not
quite
sincere
an
attitude
partially
due
to
mere
wilful
churlishness
has
never
even
mentioned
money
to
me
she
said
mildly
not
he
isna
such
a
fool
as
that
he
paused
and
continued
free
to
wed
for
me
lasses
will
do
it
i
reckon
and
thee
among
th
rest
she
smiled
and
on
that
smile
he
suddenly
turned
out
the
gas
anna
was
glad
that
the
colloquy
had
ended
so
well
congratulations
endearments
loving
regard
for
her
welfare
she
had
not
expected
these
things
and
was
in
no
wise
grieved
by
their
absence
groping
her
way
towards
the
lobby
she
considered
herself
lucky
and
only
wished
that
nothing
had
happened
to
keep
mynors
away
she
wanted
to
tell
him
at
once
that
her
father
had
proved
tractable
the
next
morning
tellwright
whose
attendance
at
chapel
was
losing
the
strictness
of
its
old
regularity
announced
that
he
should
stay
at
home
sunday
dinner
was
to
be
a
cold
repast
and
so
anna
and
agnes
went
to
chapel
anna
thoughts
were
wholly
occupied
with
the
prospect
of
seeing
mynors
and
hearing
the
explanation
of
his
absence
on
saturday
night
he
is
agnes
exclaimed
loudly
as
they
were
approaching
the
chapel
said
anna
will
you
learn
to
behave
in
the
street
mynors
stood
at
the
he
was
evidently
awaiting
them
he
looked
grave
almost
sad
he
raised
his
hat
and
shook
hands
with
a
particular
friendliness
for
agnes
who
was
speculating
whether
he
would
kiss
anna
as
his
betrothed
or
herself
as
being
only
a
little
girl
or
both
or
neither
of
them
her
eyes
already
expressed
a
sort
of
ownership
in
him
should
like
to
speak
to
you
a
moment
henry
said
you
come
into
the
you
had
better
go
straight
into
chapel
said
anna
it
was
an
ignominious
disaster
to
the
child
but
she
obeyed
did
give
you
up
last
night
till
nearly
ten
anna
remarked
as
they
passed
into
the
she
was
astonished
to
discover
in
herself
an
inclination
to
pout
to
play
the
offended
fair
one
because
mynors
had
failed
in
his
appointment
contemptuously
she
crushed
it
you
heard
about
mr
price
mynors
began
what
about
him
has
anything
happened
very
sad
thing
has
happened
yes
he
stopped
from
emotion
superintendent
has
committed
suicide
himself
anna
gasped
hanged
himself
yesterday
afternoon
at
edward
street
in
the
after
the
works
were
closed
willie
had
gone
home
but
he
came
back
when
his
father
did
turn
up
for
dinner
and
found
him
price
was
quite
dead
he
ran
in
to
my
place
to
fetch
me
just
as
i
was
getting
my
tea
that
was
why
i
never
came
last
night
anna
was
speechless
thought
i
would
tell
you
myself
henry
resumed
an
awful
thing
for
the
and
the
whole
society
too
he
a
prominent
wesleyan
a
worker
among
us
an
awful
thing
he
repeated
dominated
by
the
idea
of
the
blow
thus
dealt
to
the
methodist
connexion
by
the
man
now
dead
did
he
do
it
anna
demanded
curtly
mynors
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
ejaculated
troubles
i
suppose
it
could
be
anything
else
at
school
this
morning
i
simply
announced
that
he
was
dead
henry
voice
broke
but
he
added
after
a
pause
price
bore
himself
splendidly
last
night
anna
turned
away
in
silence
shall
come
up
for
tea
if
i
may
henry
said
and
then
they
parted
he
to
the
she
to
the
portico
of
the
chapel
people
were
talking
in
groups
on
the
broad
steps
and
in
the
vestibule
all
knew
of
the
calamity
and
had
received
from
it
a
new
interest
in
life
the
town
was
aroused
as
if
from
a
lethargy
consternation
and
eager
curiosity
were
on
every
face
those
who
arrived
in
ignorance
of
the
event
were
informed
of
it
in
impressive
tones
and
with
intense
satisfaction
to
the
informer
nothing
of
equal
importance
had
happened
in
the
society
for
decades
anna
walked
up
the
aisle
to
her
pew
filled
with
one
thought
drove
him
to
it
father
and
i
her
fear
was
that
the
miser
had
renewed
his
terrible
insistence
during
the
previous
fortnight
she
forgot
that
she
had
disliked
the
dead
man
that
he
had
always
seemed
to
her
mean
pietistic
and
she
forgot
that
in
pressing
him
for
rent
many
months
overdue
she
and
her
father
had
acted
within
their
just
rights
acted
as
price
himself
would
have
acted
in
their
place
she
could
think
only
of
the
strain
the
agony
the
despair
that
must
have
preceded
the
miserable
tragedy
old
price
had
atoned
for
all
in
one
sublime
sin
the
sole
deed
that
could
lend
dignity
and
repose
to
such
a
figure
as
his
anna
feverish
imagination
reconstituted
the
scene
in
the
she
saw
it
as
something
grand
accusing
and
unanswerable
and
she
could
not
dismiss
a
feeling
of
acute
remorse
that
she
should
have
been
engaged
in
pleasure
at
that
very
hour
of
death
surely
some
instinct
should
have
warned
her
that
the
hare
which
she
had
helped
to
hunt
was
at
its
last
gasp
sargent
the
second
minister
was
in
the
pulpit
a
little
earnest
bachelor
who
emphasised
every
sentence
with
a
continual
tremor
of
the
voice
he
said
after
the
second
hymn
and
his
tones
vibrated
with
a
singular
effect
through
the
building
i
proceed
to
my
sermon
i
have
one
word
to
say
in
reference
to
the
awful
event
which
is
doubtless
uppermost
in
the
minds
of
all
of
you
it
is
not
for
us
to
judge
the
man
who
is
now
gone
from
us
ushered
into
the
dread
presence
of
his
maker
with
the
crime
of
upon
his
soul
i
say
it
is
not
for
us
to
judge
him
the
ways
of
the
almighty
are
past
finding
out
therefore
at
such
a
moment
we
may
fitly
humble
ourselves
before
the
throne
and
while
prostrate
there
let
us
intercede
for
the
poor
young
man
who
is
left
behind
bereft
and
full
of
grief
and
shame
we
will
engage
in
silent
prayer
he
lifted
his
hand
and
closed
his
eyes
and
the
congregation
leaned
forward
against
the
fronts
of
the
pews
the
appealing
face
of
willie
presented
itself
vividly
to
anna
is
it
agnes
asked
in
a
whisper
of
appalling
distinctness
anna
frowned
angrily
and
gave
no
reply
while
the
last
hymn
was
being
sung
anna
signed
to
agnes
that
she
wished
to
leave
the
chapel
everyone
would
be
aware
that
she
was
among
price
creditors
and
she
feared
that
if
she
stayed
till
the
end
of
the
service
some
chatterer
might
draw
her
into
a
distressing
conversation
the
sisters
went
out
and
agnes
burning
curiosity
was
at
length
relieved
price
has
hanged
himself
anna
said
to
her
father
when
they
reached
home
the
miser
looked
through
the
window
for
a
moment
am
surprised
he
said
i
that
blood
titus
uncle
tried
to
kill
himself
twice
afore
he
died
o
gravel
have
to
do
summat
wi
edward
street
at
last
she
wanted
to
ask
ephraim
if
he
had
been
demanding
more
rent
lately
but
she
could
not
find
courage
to
do
so
agnes
had
to
go
to
alone
that
afternoon
without
saying
anything
to
her
father
anna
decided
to
stay
at
home
she
spent
the
time
in
her
bedroom
idle
preoccupied
and
did
not
come
downstairs
till
three
ephraim
had
gone
out
agnes
presently
returned
and
then
henry
came
in
with
tellwright
they
were
conversing
amicably
and
anna
knew
that
her
engagement
was
finally
and
satisfactorily
settled
during
tea
no
reference
was
made
to
it
nor
to
the
suicide
mynors
demeanour
was
quiet
but
cheerful
he
had
partly
recovered
from
the
morning
agitation
and
gave
ephraim
and
agnes
a
vivacious
account
of
the
attractions
of
port
erin
anna
noticed
the
amusement
in
his
eyes
when
agnes
reddening
said
to
him
you
have
some
more
henry
it
seemed
to
be
tacitly
understood
afterwards
that
agnes
and
her
father
would
attend
chapel
while
henry
and
anna
kept
house
no
one
was
ingenious
enough
to
detect
an
impropriety
in
the
arrangement
for
some
obscure
reason
immediately
upon
the
departure
of
the
anna
went
into
the
kitchen
rattled
some
plates
stroked
her
hair
mechanically
and
then
stole
back
again
to
the
parlour
it
was
a
chilly
evening
and
instead
of
walking
up
and
down
the
strip
of
garden
the
betrothed
lovers
sat
together
under
the
window
anna
wondered
whether
or
not
she
was
happy
the
presence
of
mynors
was
at
any
rate
marvellously
soothing
your
father
say
anything
about
the
price
affair
he
began
yielding
at
once
to
the
powerful
hypnotism
of
the
subject
which
fascinated
the
whole
town
that
night
and
which
anna
could
bear
neither
to
discuss
nor
to
ignore
much
she
said
and
repeated
to
him
her
father
remark
mynors
told
her
all
he
knew
how
willie
had
discovered
his
father
with
his
toes
actually
touching
the
floor
leaning
slightly
forward
quite
dead
how
he
had
then
cut
the
rope
and
fetched
mynors
who
went
with
him
to
the
how
they
had
tied
up
the
head
of
the
corpse
and
then
waited
till
night
to
wheel
the
body
on
a
from
edward
street
to
the
mortuary
chamber
at
the
how
the
police
had
telephoned
to
the
coroner
and
settled
at
once
that
the
inquest
should
be
held
on
tuesday
in
the
at
the
and
how
quiet
and
dignified
willie
had
been
surprising
everyone
by
this
manliness
it
all
seemed
hideously
real
to
anna
as
henry
added
detail
to
detail
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
she
said
very
calmly
when
he
had
finished
the
recital
i
i
dreadfully
upset
over
it
i
help
thinking
that
i
that
father
and
i
i
mean
are
somehow
partly
responsible
for
this
price
death
how
have
been
so
hard
on
him
for
his
rent
lately
you
know
dearest
girl
what
next
he
took
her
hand
in
his
assure
you
the
idea
is
absurd
you
only
got
it
because
you
so
sensitive
and
i
undertake
to
say
price
was
stuck
fast
everywhere
everywhere
had
a
chance
she
exclaimed
he
kissed
her
lovingly
but
beneath
the
feeling
of
reassurance
which
by
superior
force
he
had
imposed
on
her
there
lay
a
feeling
that
she
was
treated
like
a
frightened
child
who
must
be
tranquillized
in
the
night
nevertheless
she
was
grateful
for
his
kindness
and
when
she
went
to
bed
she
obtained
relief
from
the
returning
obsession
of
the
suicide
by
making
anew
her
vows
to
him
as
a
theatrical
effect
the
death
of
titus
price
could
scarcely
have
been
surpassed
the
town
was
profoundly
moved
by
the
spectacle
of
this
abject
yet
heroic
surrender
of
all
those
pretences
by
which
society
contrives
to
tolerate
itself
here
was
a
man
whom
no
one
respected
but
everyone
pretended
to
respect
who
knew
that
he
was
respected
by
none
but
pretended
that
he
was
respected
by
all
whose
whole
career
was
made
up
of
dissimulations
religious
moral
and
social
if
any
man
could
have
been
trusted
to
continue
the
decent
sham
to
the
end
and
so
preserve
the
general
surely
it
was
this
man
but
no
suddenly
abandoning
all
imposture
he
transgresses
openly
brazenly
and
snatching
a
bit
of
hemp
cries
me
this
is
real
human
nature
this
is
the
truth
the
rest
was
lies
i
lied
you
lied
i
confess
it
and
you
shall
confess
it
such
a
thunderclap
shakes
the
very
base
of
the
microcosm
the
young
folk
in
particular
could
with
difficulty
believe
their
ears
it
seemed
incredible
to
them
that
titus
price
the
methodist
the
superintendent
the
loud
champion
of
the
highest
virtues
should
commit
the
sin
of
all
sins
murder
they
were
dazed
the
remembrance
of
his
insincerity
did
nothing
to
mitigate
the
blow
in
their
view
it
was
perhaps
even
worse
that
he
had
played
false
to
his
own
falsity
the
elders
were
a
little
less
disturbed
the
event
was
not
unique
in
their
experience
they
had
lived
longer
and
felt
these
seismic
shocks
before
they
could
go
back
into
the
past
and
find
other
cases
where
a
swift
impulse
had
shattered
the
edifice
of
a
lifetime
they
knew
that
the
history
of
families
and
of
communities
is
crowded
with
disillusion
they
had
discovered
that
character
is
changeless
irrepressible
incurable
they
were
aware
of
the
astonishing
fact
which
takes
at
least
thirty
years
to
learn
that
a
superintendent
is
a
man
and
the
suicide
of
titus
price
when
they
had
realised
it
served
but
to
confirm
their
most
secret
and
honest
estimate
of
humanity
that
estimate
which
they
never
confided
to
a
soul
the
young
folk
thought
the
methodist
society
shamed
and
branded
by
the
tragic
incident
and
imagined
that
years
must
elapse
before
it
could
again
hold
up
its
head
in
the
town
the
old
folk
were
wiser
foreseeing
with
certainty
that
in
only
a
few
days
this
phenomenon
would
lose
its
significance
and
be
as
though
it
had
never
been
even
in
two
days
time
had
already
begun
its
work
for
by
tuesday
morning
the
interest
of
the
affair
on
sunday
at
the
highest
pitch
had
waned
so
much
that
the
thought
of
the
inquest
was
capable
of
reviving
it
although
everyone
knew
that
the
case
presented
no
unusual
features
and
that
the
coroner
inquiry
would
be
nothing
more
than
a
formal
ceremony
the
almost
greedy
curiosity
of
methodist
circles
lifted
it
to
the
level
of
a
the
court
was
filled
with
irreproachable
respectability
when
the
coroner
drove
into
the
town
and
each
animated
face
said
to
its
fellow
you
here
are
you
late
comers
of
the
official
world
councillors
guardians
of
the
poor
members
of
the
school
board
and
one
or
two
of
their
ladies
were
forced
to
intrigue
for
room
with
the
police
and
the
keeper
and
having
succeeded
sank
into
their
narrow
seats
with
a
sigh
of
expectancy
and
triumph
late
comers
with
less
influence
had
to
retire
and
by
a
kind
of
sinister
fascination
were
kept
wandering
about
the
corridor
before
they
could
decide
to
go
home
the
was
occupied
by
hundreds
of
loafers
who
seemed
to
find
a
mystic
satisfaction
in
beholding
the
coroner
dogcart
and
the
exterior
of
the
building
which
now
held
the
corpse
it
was
by
accident
that
anna
was
in
the
town
she
knew
that
the
inquest
was
to
occur
that
morning
but
had
not
dreamed
of
attending
it
when
however
she
saw
the
stir
of
excitement
in
the
and
the
police
guarding
the
entrances
of
the
she
walked
directly
across
the
road
past
the
two
officers
at
the
east
door
and
into
the
dark
main
corridor
of
the
building
which
was
dotted
with
small
groups
idly
conversing
she
was
conscious
of
two
things
a
vehement
curiosity
and
the
existence
somewhere
in
the
precincts
of
a
dead
body
unsightly
monstrous
calm
silent
careless
the
insensible
origin
of
all
this
simmering
ferment
which
disgusted
her
even
while
she
shared
in
it
at
a
small
door
half
hidden
by
a
curtain
she
was
startled
to
see
mynors
here
he
exclaimed
as
if
painfully
surprised
and
shook
hands
with
a
preoccupied
air
are
examining
willie
i
came
outside
while
he
was
in
the
the
inquest
going
on
in
there
she
asked
pointing
to
the
door
each
appeared
to
be
concealing
a
certain
resentment
against
the
other
but
this
appearance
was
due
only
to
nervous
agitation
a
policeman
down
the
corridor
called
mynors
a
moment
henry
hurried
away
answering
anna
question
as
he
went
in
there
that
the
witnesses
and
jurors
door
but
please
do
go
in
i
do
like
you
to
and
it
is
sure
to
upset
you
she
opened
the
door
and
went
in
none
said
nay
and
she
found
a
few
inches
of
behind
the
a
terrible
stench
nauseated
her
the
chamber
was
crammed
and
not
a
window
open
there
was
silence
in
the
court
no
one
seemed
to
be
doing
anything
but
at
last
she
perceived
that
the
coroner
enthroned
on
the
bench
justice
was
writing
in
a
book
with
blue
leaves
in
the
stood
william
price
dressed
in
black
with
kid
gloves
not
lounging
in
an
ungainly
attitude
as
might
have
been
expected
but
perfectly
erect
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
coroner
head
sarah
vodrey
price
aged
housekeeper
sat
on
a
chair
near
the
weeping
into
a
handkerchief
at
intervals
she
raised
her
small
wrinkled
red
face
with
its
glistening
inflamed
eyes
and
then
buried
it
again
in
the
handkerchief
the
members
of
the
jury
whom
anna
could
see
only
in
profile
shuffled
to
and
fro
on
their
long
seats
they
were
mostly
working
men
shabbily
clothed
but
the
foreman
was
leal
the
provision
dealer
a
freemason
and
a
sidesman
at
the
parish
church
the
general
public
sat
intent
and
vacuous
their
minds
gaped
if
not
their
mouths
occasionally
one
whispered
inaudibly
to
another
the
jury
conscious
of
an
official
status
exchanged
remarks
in
a
whisper
courageously
loud
several
tall
policemen
helmet
in
hand
stood
in
various
corners
of
the
room
and
the
coroner
officer
sat
near
the
to
administer
the
oath
at
length
the
coroner
lifted
his
head
he
was
rather
a
young
man
with
a
large
intelligent
face
he
wore
eyeglasses
and
his
chin
was
covered
with
a
short
wavy
beard
his
manner
showed
that
while
secretly
proud
of
his
supreme
position
in
that
assemblage
he
was
deliberately
trying
to
make
it
appear
that
this
exercise
of
judicial
authority
was
nothing
to
him
that
in
truth
these
eternal
inquiries
which
interested
others
so
deeply
were
to
him
a
weariness
conscientiously
endured
price
the
coroner
said
blandly
and
it
was
plain
that
he
was
being
ceremoniously
polite
to
an
inferior
in
obedience
to
the
rules
of
good
form
must
ask
you
some
more
questions
they
may
be
inconvenient
even
painful
but
i
am
here
simply
as
the
instrument
of
the
law
and
i
must
do
my
duty
and
these
gentlemen
here
he
waved
a
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
jury
be
told
the
whole
facts
of
the
case
we
know
of
course
that
the
deceased
committed
suicide
that
has
been
proved
beyond
doubt
but
as
i
say
we
have
the
right
to
know
more
he
paused
well
satisfied
with
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
evidently
thinking
that
he
had
said
something
very
weighty
and
impressive
do
you
want
to
know
willie
price
demanded
his
broad
five
towns
speech
contrasting
with
the
kensingtonian
accents
of
the
coroner
the
latter
who
came
originally
from
manchester
was
irritated
by
the
brusque
interruption
but
he
controlled
his
annoyance
at
the
same
time
glancing
at
the
public
as
if
to
signify
to
them
that
he
had
learnt
not
to
take
too
seriously
the
unintentional
rudeness
characteristic
of
their
district
say
it
was
probably
business
troubles
that
caused
your
late
father
to
commit
the
rash
act
are
sure
there
was
nothing
else
else
could
there
be
late
father
was
a
widower
as
to
these
business
troubles
what
were
they
were
being
pressed
by
creditors
you
a
partner
with
your
late
father
you
were
a
partner
with
him
the
jury
seemed
surprised
and
the
coroner
wrote
again
was
your
share
in
the
business
do
know
do
know
surely
that
is
rather
singular
father
took
me
in
not
long
since
we
signed
a
deed
but
i
forget
what
was
in
it
my
place
was
principally
on
the
bank
not
in
the
office
so
you
were
being
pressed
by
creditors
and
we
were
behind
with
the
rent
the
landlord
pressing
you
too
anna
lowered
her
eyes
fearful
lest
every
head
had
turned
towards
her
then
he
had
been
she
i
mean
landlord
is
a
lady
here
the
coroner
faintly
smiled
as
regards
the
landlord
the
pressure
was
less
than
it
had
been
we
had
paid
some
rent
and
settled
some
other
claims
it
not
seem
strange
the
coroner
began
with
a
suave
air
of
suggesting
an
idea
you
must
know
willie
surprisingly
burst
out
believe
it
was
the
failure
of
a
firm
in
london
that
owed
us
money
that
caused
father
to
hang
himself
exclaimed
the
coroner
did
you
hear
of
that
failure
second
post
on
friday
eleven
in
the
morning
think
we
have
heard
enough
coroner
said
leal
standing
up
in
the
have
decided
on
our
verdict
you
price
said
the
coroner
dismissing
willie
he
added
in
a
tone
of
icy
severity
to
the
foreman
had
concluded
my
examination
of
the
witness
then
he
wrote
further
in
his
book
gentlemen
of
the
jury
the
coroner
resumed
having
first
cleared
his
throat
think
you
will
agree
with
me
that
this
is
a
peculiarly
painful
case
yet
at
the
same
time
anna
hastened
from
the
court
as
impulsively
as
she
had
entered
it
she
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
quiet
silent
pitiful
corpse
and
all
this
vapid
mouthing
exasperated
her
beyond
sufferance
on
the
thursday
afternoon
anna
was
sitting
alone
in
the
house
with
the
persian
cat
and
a
pile
of
stockings
on
her
knee
darning
agnes
had
with
sorrow
returned
to
school
ephraim
was
out
the
bell
sounded
violently
and
anna
thinking
that
perhaps
for
some
reason
her
father
had
chosen
to
enter
by
the
front
door
ran
to
open
it
the
visitor
was
willie
price
he
wore
the
new
black
suit
which
had
figured
in
the
coroner
court
she
invited
him
to
the
parlour
and
they
both
sat
down
now
that
she
had
learnt
from
his
evidence
given
at
the
inquest
that
ephraim
had
not
been
pressing
for
rent
during
her
absence
in
the
isle
of
man
she
felt
less
like
a
criminal
before
willie
than
she
would
have
felt
without
that
assurance
but
at
the
best
she
was
nervous
and
shamed
she
supposed
that
he
had
called
to
make
some
arrangement
with
reference
to
the
tenure
of
the
works
or
more
probably
to
announce
a
bankruptcy
and
stoppage
miss
tellwright
willie
began
buried
him
he
gone
the
simple
and
profound
grief
and
the
restrained
bitterness
against
all
the
world
which
were
expressed
in
these
words
the
sole
epitaph
of
titus
price
nearly
made
anna
cry
she
would
have
cried
if
the
cat
had
not
opportunely
jumped
on
her
knee
again
she
controlled
herself
by
dint
of
stroking
it
she
sympathised
with
him
more
intensely
in
that
first
moment
of
his
loneliness
than
she
had
ever
sympathised
with
anyone
even
agnes
she
wished
passionately
to
shield
shelter
and
comfort
him
to
do
something
however
small
to
diminish
his
sorrow
and
humiliation
and
this
despite
his
size
his
ungainliness
his
coarse
features
his
rough
voice
his
lack
of
all
the
conventional
refinements
a
single
look
from
his
guileless
and
timid
eyes
atoned
for
every
shortcoming
yet
she
could
scarcely
open
her
mouth
she
knew
not
what
to
say
she
had
no
phrases
to
soften
the
frightful
blow
which
providence
had
dealt
him
very
sorry
she
said
must
be
relieved
it
all
over
if
she
could
have
been
sutton
for
half
an
hour
but
she
was
anna
and
her
feelings
could
only
find
outlet
in
her
eyes
happily
young
price
was
of
those
meek
ones
who
know
by
instinct
the
language
of
the
eyes
come
about
the
works
i
suppose
she
went
on
he
said
your
father
in
i
want
to
see
him
very
particular
is
in
now
she
replied
he
will
be
back
by
four
an
hour
you
do
know
where
he
is
she
shook
her
head
he
continued
must
tell
you
then
i
come
up
to
do
it
and
do
it
i
must
i
ca
come
up
again
neither
can
i
wait
you
remember
that
bill
of
exchange
as
we
gave
you
some
weeks
back
towards
rent
she
said
there
was
a
pause
he
stood
up
and
moved
to
the
mantelpiece
her
gaze
followed
him
intently
but
she
had
no
idea
what
he
was
about
to
say
forged
miss
tellwright
he
sat
down
again
and
seemed
calmer
braver
ready
to
meet
any
conceivable
set
of
consequences
she
repeated
not
immediately
grasping
the
significance
of
the
avowal
sutton
name
is
forged
on
it
so
i
came
to
tell
your
father
but
you
do
as
well
i
feel
as
if
i
should
like
to
tell
you
all
about
it
he
said
smiling
sadly
sutton
had
really
given
us
a
bill
for
thirty
pounds
but
we
paid
that
away
when
tellwright
sent
word
down
you
remember
that
he
should
put
bailiffs
in
if
he
have
pounds
next
day
we
were
just
turning
the
corner
then
father
said
to
me
there
was
a
goodish
sum
due
to
us
from
a
london
firm
in
a
month
time
and
if
we
could
only
hold
out
till
then
father
said
he
could
see
daylight
for
us
but
he
knew
as
there
be
no
getting
round
tellwright
so
he
had
the
idea
of
using
name
just
temporary
like
he
sent
me
to
the
to
buy
a
bill
stamp
and
he
wrote
out
the
bill
all
but
the
name
you
take
this
up
to
tellwright
he
says
and
ask
to
take
it
and
hold
it
and
we
redeem
it
and
that
be
all
right
no
harm
done
there
will
he
says
then
he
tries
sutton
name
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
an
easy
signature
as
you
know
but
he
could
do
it
here
will
he
says
my
old
hand
shakes
you
have
a
go
and
he
gives
me
a
letter
of
sutton
to
copy
from
i
did
it
easy
enough
after
a
try
or
two
that
be
all
right
will
he
says
and
i
put
my
hat
on
and
brought
the
bill
up
here
that
the
truth
miss
tellwright
it
was
the
smash
of
that
london
firm
that
finished
my
poor
old
father
off
her
one
feeling
was
the
sense
of
being
herself
a
culprit
after
all
it
was
her
father
action
more
than
anything
else
that
had
led
to
the
suicide
and
he
was
her
agent
price
she
said
foolishly
shall
you
do
nothing
to
be
done
he
replied
was
bound
to
be
our
luck
we
no
thought
but
what
we
should
bring
you
thirty
pound
in
cash
and
get
that
bit
of
paper
back
and
rip
it
up
and
no
one
the
worse
but
we
were
always
unlucky
me
and
him
all
you
got
to
do
is
just
to
tell
your
father
and
say
i
ready
to
go
to
the
when
he
gives
the
word
it
a
bad
business
but
ready
for
it
we
do
something
she
naïvely
inquired
with
a
vision
of
a
trial
and
sentence
and
years
of
prison
father
keeps
the
bill
does
he
not
you
could
ask
him
to
destroy
it
would
said
willie
excuse
me
saying
that
miss
tellwright
but
he
would
he
rose
as
if
to
go
bitterly
as
for
anna
she
knew
well
that
her
father
would
never
permit
the
bill
to
be
destroyed
but
at
any
cost
she
meant
to
comfort
him
then
to
ease
his
lot
to
send
him
away
less
grievous
than
he
came
she
said
standing
up
and
abandoning
the
cat
will
see
what
can
be
done
yes
something
be
done
something
or
other
i
will
come
and
see
you
at
the
works
afternoon
you
may
rely
on
me
she
saw
hope
brighten
his
eyes
at
the
earnestness
and
resolution
of
her
tone
and
she
felt
richly
rewarded
he
never
said
another
word
but
gripped
her
hand
with
such
force
that
she
flinched
in
pain
when
he
had
gone
she
perceived
clearly
the
dire
dilemma
but
cared
nothing
in
the
first
bliss
of
having
reassured
him
during
tea
it
occurred
to
her
that
as
soon
as
agnes
had
gone
to
bed
she
would
put
the
situation
plainly
before
her
father
and
for
the
first
and
last
time
in
her
life
assert
herself
she
would
tell
him
that
the
affair
was
after
all
entirely
her
own
she
would
firmly
demand
possession
of
the
bill
of
exchange
and
she
would
insist
on
it
being
destroyed
she
would
point
out
to
the
old
man
that
her
promise
having
been
given
to
willie
price
no
other
course
than
this
was
possible
in
planning
this
on
her
father
obstinacy
she
found
argument
after
argument
auspicious
of
its
success
the
formidable
tyrant
was
at
last
to
meet
his
equal
in
force
in
resolution
and
in
pugnacity
the
swiftness
of
her
onrush
would
sweep
him
for
once
off
his
feet
at
whatever
cost
she
was
bound
to
win
even
though
victory
resulted
in
eternal
enmity
between
father
and
daughter
she
saw
herself
towering
over
him
morally
with
blazing
eye
and
scornful
nostril
and
thus
meditating
on
the
grandeur
of
her
adventure
she
fed
her
courage
with
indignation
by
the
act
of
death
titus
price
had
put
her
father
for
ever
in
the
wrong
his
corpse
accused
the
miser
and
anna
incapable
now
of
seeing
aught
save
the
pathos
of
suicide
acquiesced
in
the
accusation
with
all
the
strength
of
her
remorse
she
did
not
reason
she
felt
reason
was
shrivelled
up
in
the
fire
of
emotion
she
almost
trembled
with
the
urgency
of
her
desire
to
protect
from
further
shame
the
figure
of
willie
price
so
frank
simple
innocent
and
big
and
to
protect
also
the
lifeless
and
dishonoured
body
of
his
parent
she
reviewed
the
whole
circumstances
again
and
again
each
time
finding
less
excuse
for
her
father
implacable
and
fatal
cruelty
so
her
thoughts
ran
until
the
appointed
hour
of
agnes
bedtime
it
was
always
necessary
to
remind
agnes
of
that
hour
left
to
herself
the
child
would
have
stayed
up
till
the
very
day
of
judgment
the
clock
struck
but
anna
kept
silence
to
utter
the
word
to
agnes
was
to
open
the
attack
on
her
father
and
she
felt
as
the
conductor
of
an
opera
feels
before
setting
in
motion
a
complicated
activity
which
may
end
in
either
triumph
or
an
unspeakable
fiasco
the
child
was
reading
anna
looked
and
looked
at
her
and
at
length
her
lips
were
set
for
the
phrase
agnes
when
suddenly
the
old
man
forestalled
her
that
wench
going
for
sit
here
all
night
he
asked
of
anna
menacingly
agnes
shut
her
book
and
crept
away
this
accident
was
the
ruin
of
anna
scheme
her
father
always
the
favourite
of
circumstance
had
by
chance
struck
the
first
blow
ignorant
of
the
battle
that
awaited
him
he
had
unwittingly
won
it
by
putting
her
in
the
wrong
as
titus
price
had
put
him
in
the
wrong
she
knew
in
a
flash
that
her
enterprise
was
hopeless
she
knew
that
her
father
position
in
regard
to
her
was
impregnable
that
no
moral
force
no
consciousness
of
right
would
avail
to
overthrow
that
authority
which
she
had
herself
made
absolute
by
a
submission
she
knew
that
face
to
face
with
her
father
she
was
and
always
would
be
a
coward
and
now
instead
of
finding
arguments
for
success
she
found
arguments
for
failure
she
divined
all
the
retorts
that
he
would
fling
at
her
what
about
sutton
in
a
sense
the
victim
of
this
fraud
it
was
not
merely
a
matter
of
thirty
pounds
a
man
name
had
been
used
was
he
ephraim
tellwright
and
she
his
daughter
to
connive
at
a
felony
the
felony
was
done
and
could
not
be
undone
were
they
to
render
themselves
liable
even
in
theory
to
a
criminal
prosecution
if
titus
price
had
killed
himself
what
of
that
if
willie
price
was
threatened
with
ruin
what
of
that
them
as
made
the
bed
must
lie
on
it
at
the
best
and
apart
from
any
forgery
the
prices
had
swindled
their
creditors
even
in
dying
old
price
had
been
guilty
of
a
commercial
swindle
and
was
the
fact
that
father
and
son
between
them
had
committed
a
direct
and
flagrant
crime
to
serve
as
an
excuse
for
sympathising
with
the
survivor
why
was
anna
so
anxious
to
shield
the
forger
what
claim
had
he
a
forger
was
a
forger
and
that
was
the
end
of
it
she
went
to
bed
without
opening
her
mouth
irresolute
shamed
and
despairing
she
tried
to
pray
for
guidance
but
she
could
bring
no
sincerity
of
appeal
into
this
prayer
it
seemed
an
empty
form
where
indeed
was
her
religion
she
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
the
fervour
of
her
aspirations
had
been
steadily
cooling
for
weeks
she
was
not
a
whit
more
a
true
christian
now
than
she
had
been
before
the
revival
it
appeared
that
she
was
incapable
of
real
religion
possibly
one
of
those
souls
foreordained
to
damnation
this
admission
added
to
the
general
sense
of
futility
and
increased
her
misery
she
lay
awake
for
hours
confronting
her
deliberate
promise
to
willie
price
shall
be
on
he
was
relying
on
her
then
but
on
whom
could
she
rely
to
whom
could
she
turn
it
is
significant
that
the
idea
of
confiding
in
henry
mynors
did
not
present
itself
for
a
single
moment
as
practical
mynors
had
been
kind
to
willie
in
his
trouble
but
anna
almost
resented
this
kindness
on
account
of
the
condescending
superiority
which
she
thought
she
detected
therein
it
was
as
though
she
had
overheard
mynors
saying
to
himself
is
this
poor
crushed
worm
it
is
my
duty
as
a
christian
to
pity
and
succour
him
i
will
do
so
i
am
a
righteous
man
the
thought
of
anyone
stooping
to
willie
was
hateful
to
her
she
felt
equal
with
him
as
a
mother
feels
equal
with
her
child
when
it
cries
and
she
soothes
it
and
she
felt
in
another
way
that
he
was
equal
with
her
as
she
thought
of
his
sturdy
and
simple
confession
and
of
the
loyal
love
in
his
voice
when
he
spoke
of
his
father
she
liked
him
for
hurting
her
hand
and
for
refusing
to
snatch
at
the
slender
chance
of
her
clemency
she
could
never
reveal
willie
sin
if
it
was
a
sin
to
henry
mynors
that
symbol
of
correctness
and
of
success
she
had
fraternised
with
sinners
like
christ
and
with
amazing
injustice
she
was
capable
of
deeming
mynors
a
pharisee
because
she
could
not
find
fault
with
him
because
he
lived
and
loved
so
impeccably
and
so
triumphantly
there
was
only
one
person
from
whom
she
could
have
asked
advice
and
help
and
that
wise
and
consoling
heart
was
far
away
in
the
isle
of
man
wo
father
give
up
the
bill
she
demanded
half
aloud
in
sullen
wrath
she
could
not
frame
the
answer
in
words
but
nevertheless
she
knew
it
and
felt
it
such
an
act
of
grace
would
have
been
impossible
to
her
father
nature
that
was
all
suddenly
the
expression
of
her
face
changed
from
utter
disgust
into
a
bitter
and
proud
smile
without
thinking
further
without
daring
to
think
she
rose
out
of
bed
and
and
crept
with
infinite
precaution
downstairs
the
oilcloth
on
the
stairs
froze
her
feet
a
cold
grey
light
issuing
through
the
glass
square
over
the
front
door
showed
that
dawn
was
beginning
the
door
of
the
was
shut
she
opened
it
gently
and
went
within
every
object
in
the
room
was
faintly
visible
the
bureau
the
chair
the
files
of
papers
the
pictures
the
books
on
the
mantelshelf
and
the
safe
in
the
corner
the
bureau
she
knew
was
never
locked
fear
of
their
father
had
always
kept
its
privacy
inviolate
from
anna
and
agnes
without
the
aid
of
a
key
as
anna
stood
in
front
of
it
a
shaking
figure
with
hair
hanging
loose
she
dimly
remembered
having
one
day
seen
a
blue
paper
among
white
in
the
but
if
the
bill
was
not
there
she
vowed
that
she
would
steal
her
father
keys
while
he
slept
and
force
the
safe
she
opened
the
bureau
and
at
once
saw
the
edge
of
a
blue
paper
corresponding
with
her
recollection
she
pulled
it
forth
and
scanned
it
months
after
date
pay
to
our
order
accepted
payable
so
here
was
the
forgery
here
the
two
words
for
which
willie
price
might
have
gone
to
prison
what
a
trifle
she
tore
the
flimsy
document
to
bits
and
crumpled
the
bits
into
a
little
ball
how
should
she
dispose
of
the
ball
after
a
moment
reflection
she
went
into
the
kitchen
stretched
on
tiptoe
to
reach
the
from
the
high
mantelpiece
struck
a
match
and
burnt
the
ball
in
the
grate
then
with
a
restrained
and
sinister
laugh
she
ran
softly
upstairs
the
matter
anna
agnes
was
sitting
up
in
bed
wide
awake
go
to
sleep
and
do
bother
anna
angrily
whispered
had
she
closed
the
lid
of
the
bureau
she
was
compelled
to
return
in
order
to
make
sure
yes
it
was
closed
when
at
length
she
lay
in
bed
breathless
her
heart
violently
beating
her
feet
like
icicles
she
realised
what
she
had
done
she
had
saved
willie
price
but
she
had
ruined
herself
with
her
father
she
knew
well
that
he
would
never
forgive
her
on
the
following
afternoon
she
planned
to
hurry
to
edward
street
and
back
while
ephraim
and
agnes
were
both
out
of
the
house
but
for
some
reason
her
father
sat
persistently
after
dinner
conning
a
sale
catalogue
at
a
quarter
to
three
he
had
not
moved
she
decided
to
go
at
any
risks
she
put
on
her
hat
and
jacket
and
opened
the
front
door
he
heard
her
he
called
sharply
she
obeyed
the
summons
in
terror
going
out
father
to
town
to
buy
some
things
always
buying
that
was
all
he
let
her
free
in
an
unworthy
attempt
to
appease
her
conscience
she
did
in
fact
go
first
into
the
town
she
bought
some
wool
the
trick
was
despicable
then
she
hastened
to
edward
street
the
decrepit
works
seemed
to
have
undergone
no
change
she
had
expected
the
business
would
be
suspended
and
willie
price
alone
on
the
bank
but
manufacture
was
proceeding
as
usual
she
went
direct
to
the
office
fancying
as
she
climbed
the
stairs
that
every
window
of
all
the
workshops
was
full
of
eyes
to
discern
her
purpose
without
knocking
she
pushed
against
the
unlatched
door
and
entered
willie
was
lolling
in
his
father
chair
gloomy
meditative
apparently
idle
he
was
coatless
and
wore
a
dirty
apron
a
battered
hat
was
at
the
back
of
his
head
and
his
great
hands
which
lay
on
the
desk
in
front
of
him
were
soiled
he
sprang
up
flushing
red
and
she
shut
the
door
they
were
alone
together
all
in
my
dirt
he
murmured
apologetically
simple
and
silly
creature
to
imagine
that
she
cared
for
his
dirt
all
right
she
said
need
worry
any
more
it
all
right
they
were
glorious
words
for
her
and
her
face
shone
do
you
mean
he
asked
gruffly
she
smiled
full
of
happiness
got
that
paper
and
burnt
it
he
looked
at
her
exactly
as
if
he
had
not
understood
your
father
know
she
still
smiled
at
him
happily
but
i
shall
tell
him
this
afternoon
it
all
right
i
burnt
it
he
sank
down
in
the
chair
and
laying
his
head
on
the
desk
burst
into
sobbing
tears
she
stood
over
him
and
put
a
hand
on
the
sleeve
of
his
shirt
at
that
touch
he
sobbed
more
violently
price
what
is
it
she
asked
the
question
in
a
calm
soothing
tone
he
glanced
up
at
her
his
face
wet
yet
apparently
not
shamed
by
the
tears
she
could
not
meet
his
gaze
without
herself
crying
and
so
she
turned
her
head
was
only
thinking
he
stammered
thinking
what
an
angel
you
are
only
the
meek
the
timid
the
silent
can
in
moments
of
deep
feeling
use
this
language
of
hyperbole
without
seeming
ridiculous
he
was
her
great
child
and
she
knew
that
he
worshipped
her
oh
ineffable
power
that
out
of
misfortune
canst
create
divine
happiness
later
he
remarked
in
his
ordinary
tone
was
expecting
your
father
here
this
afternoon
about
the
lease
there
is
to
be
a
deed
of
arrangement
with
the
creditors
father
she
exclaimed
and
she
bade
him
as
she
passed
under
the
archway
she
heard
a
familiar
voice
reckon
i
shall
find
young
mester
price
in
th
office
ephraim
who
had
wandered
into
the
turned
and
saw
her
through
the
doorway
a
second
delay
and
she
would
have
escaped
she
stood
waiting
the
storm
and
then
they
walked
out
into
the
road
together
what
art
doing
here
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
art
doing
here
he
repeated
coldly
i
was
just
going
back
home
he
hesitated
an
instant
go
with
thee
he
said
they
walked
back
to
manor
terrace
in
silence
they
had
tea
in
silence
except
that
agnes
with
dreadful
inopportuneness
continually
worried
her
father
for
a
definite
promise
that
she
might
leave
school
at
christmas
the
idea
was
preposterous
but
agnes
fired
by
her
recent
success
as
a
housekeeper
clung
to
it
ignorant
of
her
imminent
danger
and
misinterpreting
the
signs
of
his
face
she
at
last
pushed
her
insistence
too
far
to
bed
this
minute
he
said
in
a
voice
suddenly
terrible
she
perceived
her
error
then
but
it
was
too
late
looking
wistfully
at
anna
the
child
fled
was
told
this
morning
miss
ephraim
began
as
soon
as
agnes
was
gone
young
price

bin
seen
coming
to
this
house

afternoon
i
thought
as
it
was
strange

nowt
about

to
thy
feyther
but
i
never
suspected
as
a
daughter
o
mine
was
up
to
any
tricks
there
was
a
look
on
thy
face
this
afternoon
when
i
asked
where
thou
wast
going
but
i
didna
think
thou
wast
lying
to
me

she
began
and
stopped

now
what
is
it
what
this
between
thee
and
will

i
have
it
out
of
thee

no
father
why
hast
thou
gotten
secrets
why
dost
go
sneaking
about
to
see
him
sneaking
creeping
like
any
brazen
moll
the
miser
was
wounded
in
the
one
spot
where
there
remained
to
him
any
sentiment
capable
of
being
wounded
his
faith
in
the
irreproachable
absolute
chastity
in
thought
and
deed
of
his
womankind
price
came
in
here
yesterday
anna
began
white
and
calm
see
you
but
you
were
in
so
he
saw
me
he
told
me
that
bill
of
exchange
that
blue
paper
for
thirty
pounds
was
forged
he
said
he
had
forged
sutton
name
on
it
she
stopped
expecting
the
thunder
on
with
thy
tale
said
ephraim
breathing
loudly
said
he
was
ready
to
go
to
prison
as
soon
as
you
gave
the
word
but
i
told
him
no
such
thing
i
said
it
must
be
settled
quietly
i
told
him
to
leave
it
to
me
he
was
driven
to
the
forgery
and
i
thought
mean
to
say
the
miser
shouted
that
blasted
scoundrel
came
here
and
told
thee
he
forged
a
bill
and
thou
told
him
to
leave
it
to
thee
to
settle
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
jumped
up
and
strode
to
the
door
evidently
with
the
intention
of
examining
the
forged
document
for
himself
is
there
it
is
there
anna
called
to
him
wildly
isna
there
paper
i
may
as
well
tell
you
father
i
got
up
early
this
morning
and
burnt
it
the
man
was
staggered
at
this
audacious
and
astounding
impiety
was
mine
really
she
continued
i
thought
thought
agnes
upstairs
heard
that
passionate
and
consuming
roar
on
thee
anna
tellwright
shame
on
thee
for
a
shameless
hussy
a
daughter
o
mine
and
just
promised
to
another
man
an
accomplice
in
forgery
thou
sees
the
scamp
on
the
sly
thou
he
paused
and
then
added
with
furious
scorn
speak
o
this
to
henry
mynors
will
tell
him
if
you
like
she
said
proudly
thee
here
he
hissed
thou
breathes
a
word
o
this
to
henry
mynors
or
any
other
man
i
cut
thy
tongue
out
a
daughter
o
mine
if
thou
breathes
a
word
shall
not
father
it
was
finished
grey
with
frightful
anger
ephraim
left
the
room
chapter
xii
at
the
priory
she
was
not
to
be
pardoned
the
offence
was
too
monstrous
daring
and
final
at
the
same
time
the
unappeasable
ire
of
the
old
man
tended
to
weaken
his
power
over
her
all
her
life
she
had
been
terrorised
by
the
fear
of
a
wrath
which
had
never
reached
the
superlative
degree
until
that
day
now
that
she
had
seen
and
felt
the
limit
of
his
anger
she
became
aware
that
she
could
endure
it
the
curse
was
heavy
and
perhaps
more
irksome
than
heavy
but
she
survived
she
continued
to
breathe
eat
drink
and
sleep
her
father
power
stopped
short
of
annihilation
here
too
was
a
satisfaction
that
things
could
not
be
worse
and
still
greater
comfort
lay
in
the
fact
that
she
had
not
only
accomplished
the
deliverance
of
willie
price
but
had
secured
absolute
secrecy
concerning
the
episode
the
next
day
was
saturday
when
after
breakfast
it
was
custom
to
give
anna
the
weekly
sovereign
for
housekeeping
agnes
he
said
turning
in
his
armchair
to
face
the
child
and
drawing
a
sovereign
from
his
charge
o
this
and
mind
ye
make
it
go
as
far
as
ye
can
his
tone
conveyed
a
subsidiary
message
am
terribly
angry
but
i
am
not
angry
with
you
however
behave
yourself
the
child
mechanically
took
the
coin
scared
by
this
proof
of
an
unprecedented
domestic
convulsion
anna
with
a
tightening
of
the
lips
rose
and
went
into
the
kitchen
agnes
followed
after
a
discreet
interval
and
in
silence
gave
up
the
sovereign
is
it
all
about
anna
she
ventured
to
ask
that
night
mind
said
anna
curtly
the
question
had
needed
some
courage
for
at
certain
times
agnes
would
as
easily
have
trifled
with
her
father
as
with
anna
from
that
moment
with
the
passive
fatalism
characteristic
of
her
years
spirits
began
to
rise
again
to
the
normal
level
she
accepted
the
new
situation
and
fitted
herself
into
it
with
a
child
adaptability
if
anna
naturally
felt
a
slight
resentment
against
this
too
impartial
and
apparently
callous
attitude
on
the
part
of
the
child
she
never
showed
it
nearly
a
week
later
anna
received
a
postcard
from
beatrice
announcing
her
complete
recovery
and
the
immediate
return
of
her
parents
and
herself
to
bursley
that
same
afternoon
a
cab
encumbered
with
much
luggage
passed
up
the
street
as
anna
was
fixing
clean
curtains
in
her
father
bedroom
beatrice
on
the
waved
a
hand
and
smiled
and
anna
responded
to
the
signals
she
was
glad
now
that
the
suttons
had
come
back
though
for
several
days
she
had
almost
forgotten
their
existence
on
the
saturday
afternoon
mynors
called
anna
was
in
the
kitchen
she
heard
him
scuffling
with
agnes
in
the
lobby
and
then
talking
to
her
father
three
times
she
had
seen
him
since
her
disgrace
and
each
time
the
secret
bitterness
of
her
soul
despite
conscientious
effort
to
repress
it
had
marred
the
meeting
it
had
been
plain
indeed
that
she
was
profoundly
disturbed
he
had
affected
at
first
not
to
observe
the
change
in
her
and
she
anticipating
his
questions
hinted
briefly
that
the
trouble
was
with
her
father
and
had
no
reference
to
himself
and
that
she
preferred
not
to
discuss
it
at
all
reassured
and
too
young
in
courtship
yet
to
presume
on
a
rights
he
respected
her
wish
and
endeavoured
by
every
art
to
restore
her
to
equanimity
this
time
as
she
went
to
greet
him
in
the
parlour
she
resolved
that
he
should
see
no
more
of
the
shadow
he
noticed
instantly
the
difference
in
her
face
come
to
take
you
into
sutton
for
tea
and
for
the
evening
he
said
eagerly
must
come
they
are
very
anxious
to
see
you
told
your
father
he
added
ephraim
had
vanished
into
his
office
did
he
say
henry
she
asked
timidly
said
you
must
please
yourself
of
course
come
along
love
must
she
agnes
agnes
concurred
and
said
that
she
would
get
her
father
tea
and
his
supper
too
will
come
he
urged
she
nodded
smiling
thoughtfully
and
he
kissed
her
for
the
first
time
in
front
of
agnes
who
was
filled
with
pride
at
this
proof
of
their
confidence
in
her
ready
henry
anna
said
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
and
they
went
across
to
sutton
tell
me
all
about
it
beatrice
burst
out
when
she
and
anna
had
fled
to
her
bedroom
so
glad
do
you
love
him
really
truly
he
dreadfully
fond
of
you
he
told
me
so
this
morning
we
had
quite
a
long
chat
in
the
market
i
think
you
both
very
lucky
you
know
she
kissed
anna
effusively
for
the
third
time
anna
looked
at
her
smiling
but
silent
beatrice
said
do
you
want
me
to
say
you
are
the
funniest
girl
anna
i
ever
met
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
indeed
beatrice
added
in
a
different
tone
imagine
this
affair
was
the
least
bit
of
a
surprise
to
us
it
was
the
fact
is
henry
had
oh
well
never
mind
do
you
know
mother
and
dad
used
to
think
there
was
something
between
henry
and
me
but
there
was
you
know
not
really
i
tell
you
that
so
that
you
wo
be
able
to
say
you
were
kept
in
the
dark
when
shall
you
be
married
anna
have
the
least
idea
anna
replied
and
began
to
question
beatrice
about
her
convalescence
perfectly
well
beatrice
said
always
the
same
if
i
catch
anything
i
catch
it
bad
and
get
it
over
quickly
how
long
are
you
two
chatterboxes
going
to
stay
here
it
was
sutton
who
came
into
the
room
you
got
those
letters
to
write
eh
anna
but
i
glad
of
this
you
make
him
a
good
wife
you
two
just
suit
each
other
anna
could
not
but
be
impressed
by
this
unaffected
joy
of
her
friends
in
the
engagement
her
spirits
rose
and
once
more
she
saw
visions
of
future
happiness
at
tea
alderman
sutton
added
his
felicitations
to
the
rest
with
that
flattering
air
of
intimate
sympathy
and
comprehension
which
some
men
can
adopt
towards
young
girls
the
tea
made
specially
magnificent
in
honour
of
the
betrothal
was
such
a
meal
as
could
only
have
been
compassed
in
staffordshire
or
yorkshire
a
high
tea
of
the
last
richness
and
excellence
exquisitely
gracious
to
the
palate
but
ruthless
in
its
demands
on
the
stomach
at
one
end
of
the
table
which
glittered
with
silver
glass
and
longshaw
china
was
a
fowl
which
had
been
boiled
for
four
hours
at
the
other
a
hot
islanded
in
liquor
which
might
have
satisfied
a
regiment
between
these
two
dishes
were
all
the
delicacies
which
differentiate
high
tea
from
tea
and
on
the
quality
of
which
the
success
of
the
meal
really
depends
hot
pikelets
hot
crumpets
hot
toast
sardines
with
tomatoes
lettuce
marmalade
and
jams
the
repast
occupied
over
an
hour
and
even
then
not
a
quarter
of
the
food
was
consumed
surrounded
by
all
that
good
fare
and
with
the
alderman
on
her
left
henry
on
her
right
and
a
bright
fire
in
front
of
her
anna
quickly
caught
the
gaiety
of
the
others
she
forgot
everything
but
the
gladness
of
reunion
the
joy
of
the
moment
the
luxurious
comfort
of
the
house
conversation
was
busy
with
the
doings
of
the
suttons
at
port
erin
after
anna
and
henry
had
left
a
listener
would
have
caught
fragments
like
this
know
a
point
no
not
there
over
the
hill
well
we
hired
a
carriage
and
drove
the
weather
was
simply
tom
kelly
said
he
never
and
that
little
guard
on
the
railway
came
all
the
way
down
to
the
steamer
did
you
see
anything
in
the
signal
about
the
actress
being
drowned
oh
it
was
awfully
sad
we
saw
the
corpse
just
after
beatrice
will
you
hush
it
terrible
about
titus
price
beatrice
exclaimed
my
sighed
sutton
glancing
at
anna
can
never
tell
what
going
to
happen
next
i
always
afraid
to
go
away
for
fear
of
something
happening
a
silence
followed
when
tea
was
finished
beatrice
was
taken
away
by
her
mother
to
write
the
letters
concerning
the
immediate
resumption
of
and
for
a
little
time
anna
was
left
in
the
alone
with
the
two
men
who
began
to
talk
about
the
affairs
of
the
prices
it
appeared
that
sutton
had
been
asked
to
become
trustee
for
the
creditors
under
a
deed
of
arrangement
and
that
he
had
hopes
of
being
able
to
sell
the
business
as
a
going
concern
in
the
meantime
it
would
need
careful
management
willie
price
manage
it
anna
inquired
the
question
seemed
to
divert
henry
and
the
alderman
to
afford
them
a
contemptuous
and
somewhat
inimical
amusement
at
the
expense
of
willie
said
the
alderman
quietly
but
emphatically
william
is
fairly
good
on
the
works
said
henry
in
the
office
i
imagine
he
is
worse
than
useless
grieved
and
confused
anna
bent
down
and
moved
a
hassock
in
order
to
hide
her
face
the
attitude
of
these
men
to
willie
price
that
victim
of
circumstances
and
of
his
own
simplicity
wounded
anna
inexpressibly
she
perceived
that
they
could
see
in
him
only
a
defaulting
debtor
that
his
misfortune
made
no
appeal
to
their
charity
she
wondered
that
men
so
and
kind
in
some
relations
could
be
so
hard
in
others
had
a
talk
with
your
father
at
the
creditors
meeting
yesterday
said
the
alderman
wo
lose
much
of
course
you
got
a
preferential
claim
for
six
months
rent
he
said
this
reassuringly
as
though
it
would
give
satisfaction
anna
did
not
know
what
a
preferential
claim
might
be
nor
was
she
aware
of
any
meeting
she
wished
ardently
that
she
might
lose
as
much
as
possible
hundreds
of
pounds
she
was
relieved
when
beatrice
swept
in
her
mother
following
your
worship
said
beatrice
to
her
father
stamps
for
these
letters
please
anna
glanced
up
inquiringly
on
hearing
the
form
of
address
do
mean
to
say
that
you
did
know
that
father
is
going
to
be
mayor
this
year
beatrice
asked
as
if
shocked
at
this
ignorance
of
affairs
it
was
all
settled
rather
late
was
it
dad
and
the
pretends
not
to
care
much
but
actually
he
is
filled
with
pride
is
he
dad
as
for
the
mayoress
bee
sutton
stopped
her
smiling
tumble
over
that
tongue
of
yours
some
day
said
i
was
to
mention
it
said
beatrice
you
should
think
we
were
putting
on
airs
not
i
sutton
protested
said
no
such
thing
anna
knows
us
too
well
for
that
but
i
not
so
set
up
with
this
mayor
business
as
some
people
will
think
i
am
as
beatrice
is
mynors
added
at
eight
and
again
at
nine
anna
said
that
she
must
go
home
but
the
suttons
now
frankly
absorbed
in
the
topic
of
the
mayoralty
their
secret
preoccupation
would
not
spoil
the
confidential
talk
which
had
ensued
by
letting
the
lovers
depart
it
was
nearly
nine
before
anna
and
henry
stood
on
the
pavement
outside
and
beatrice
after
facetious
farewells
had
shut
the
door
us
just
walk
round
by
the
manor
farm
henry
pleaded
take
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
she
agreed
dutifully
the
footpath
ran
at
right
angles
to
trafalgar
road
past
a
colliery
whose
glowed
in
the
dark
moonless
autumn
night
and
then
across
a
field
they
stood
on
a
knoll
near
the
old
farmstead
that
extraordinary
and
pathetic
survival
of
a
vanished
agriculture
immediately
in
front
of
them
stretched
acres
of
burning
ironstone
a
vast
tremulous
carpet
of
flame
woven
in
red
purple
and
strange
greens
beyond
were
the
silhouettes
of
and
the
solid
forms
of
furnace
and
in
the
distance
a
canal
reflected
the
gigantic
illuminations
of
cauldon
bar
ironworks
it
was
a
scene
mysterious
and
romantic
enough
to
kindle
the
raptures
of
love
but
anna
felt
cold
melancholy
and
apprehensive
of
vague
sorrows
am
i
so
she
asked
herself
and
tried
in
vain
to
shake
off
the
mood
will
willie
price
do
if
the
business
is
sold
she
questioned
mynors
suddenly
he
said
to
soothe
her
are
still
worrying
about
that
misfortune
i
wish
you
had
never
gone
near
the
inquest
the
thing
seems
to
have
got
on
your
mind
no
she
protested
with
an
air
of
cheerfulness
i
was
just
wondering
willie
will
have
to
do
the
best
he
can
get
a
place
somewhere
i
suppose
it
wo
be
much
at
the
best
had
he
guessed
what
perhaps
hung
on
that
answer
mynors
might
have
given
it
in
a
tone
less
callous
and
perfunctory
could
he
have
seen
the
tightening
of
her
lips
he
might
even
afterwards
have
repaired
his
error
by
some
voluntary
assurance
that
willie
price
should
be
watched
over
with
a
benevolent
eye
and
protected
with
a
strong
arm
but
how
was
he
to
know
that
in
misprizing
willie
price
before
her
he
was
misprizing
a
child
to
its
mother
he
had
done
something
for
willie
price
and
considered
that
he
had
done
enough
his
thoughts
moreover
were
on
other
matters
you
remember
that
day
we
went
up
to
the
park
he
murmured
fondly
sunday
i
have
never
told
you
that
that
evening
i
came
out
of
chapel
after
the
first
hymn
when
i
noticed
you
were
there
and
walked
up
past
your
house
i
could
help
it
something
drew
me
i
nearly
called
in
to
see
you
then
i
thought
i
had
better
not
saw
you
she
said
calmly
his
warmth
made
her
feel
sad
saw
you
stop
at
the
gate
did
but
you
were
at
the
window
saw
you
through
the
glass
of
the
her
voice
grew
fainter
more
reluctant
you
were
watching
in
the
dark
he
seized
her
with
such
violence
and
kissed
her
so
vehemently
that
she
was
startled
out
of
herself
henry
she
exclaimed
me
harry
he
entreated
his
arm
still
round
her
waist
want
you
to
call
me
harry
no
one
else
does
or
ever
has
done
and
no
one
shall
now
she
said
deliberately
bracing
her
mind
to
a
positive
determination
she
must
please
him
and
she
said
it
again
yes
it
has
a
nice
sound
ephraim
sat
reading
the
in
the
parlour
when
she
arrived
home
at
five
minutes
to
ten
imbued
then
with
ideas
of
duty
submission
and
systematic
kindliness
she
had
an
impulse
to
attempt
a
reconciliation
with
her
father
father
she
said
hope
i
not
kept
you
up
he
was
deaf
she
went
to
bed
resigned
sad
but
not
gloomy
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
during
all
her
life
she
had
been
accustomed
to
infelicity
experience
had
taught
her
this
to
be
the
mistress
of
herself
she
knew
that
she
could
face
any
fact
even
the
fact
of
her
dispassionate
frigidity
under
mynors
caresses
it
was
on
the
firm
almost
rapturous
resolve
to
succour
willie
price
if
need
be
that
she
fell
asleep
the
engagement
which
had
hitherto
been
kept
private
became
the
theme
of
universal
gossip
immediately
upon
the
return
of
the
suttons
from
the
isle
of
man
two
words
let
fall
by
beatrice
in
the
luke
covered
market
on
saturday
morning
had
increased
and
multiplied
till
the
whole
town
echoed
with
the
news
anna
private
fortune
rose
as
high
as
a
quarter
of
a
million
as
for
henry
mynors
it
was
said
that
henry
mynors
knew
what
he
was
about
after
all
he
was
like
the
rest
money
money
of
course
it
was
inconceivable
that
a
fine
prosperous
figure
of
a
man
such
as
mynors
would
have
made
up
to
if
she
had
not
been
simply
rolling
in
money
well
there
was
one
thing
to
be
said
for
young
mynors
he
would
put
money
to
good
use
you
might
rely
he
would
not
hoard
it
up
same
as
it
had
been
hoarded
up
however
the
more
saved
the
more
for
young
mynors
so
he
need
grumble
it
was
to
be
hoped
he
would
make
her
dress
herself
a
bit
better
though
indeed
it
had
been
her
fault
she
went
about
so
shabby
the
old
skinflint
would
never
allow
her
a
penny
of
her
own
so
tongues
wagged
the
first
sunday
was
a
tiresome
ordeal
for
anna
both
at
school
and
at
chapel
i
never
seemed
to
be
written
like
a
note
of
exclamation
on
every
brow
the
monotony
of
the
congratulations
fatigued
her
as
much
as
her
involuntary
efforts
to
grasp
what
each
speaker
had
left
unsaid
of
innuendo
malice
envy
or
sycophancy
even
the
people
in
the
shops
during
the
next
few
days
could
not
serve
her
without
direct
and
curious
reference
to
her
private
affairs
the
general
opinion
that
she
was
a
cold
and
bloodless
creature
was
strengthened
by
her
attitude
at
this
period
but
the
apathy
which
she
displayed
was
neither
affected
nor
due
to
an
excessive
diffidence
as
she
seemed
so
she
felt
she
often
wondered
what
would
have
happened
to
her
if
that
vague
between
henry
and
beatrice
to
which
beatrice
had
confessed
had
ever
taken
definite
shape
came
back
from
lancashire
last
night
said
mynors
when
he
arrived
at
manor
terrace
on
the
next
saturday
afternoon
ephraim
was
in
the
room
and
henry
evidently
joyous
and
triumphant
addressed
both
him
and
anna
hancock
the
commercial
traveller
anna
asked
she
knew
that
hancock
was
the
commercial
traveller
but
she
experienced
a
nervous
compulsion
to
make
idle
remarks
in
order
to
hide
the
breach
of
intercourse
between
her
father
and
herself
said
mynors
had
a
magnificent
journey
much
asked
the
miser
henry
named
the
amount
of
orders
taken
in
a
fortnight
journey
the
miser
ejaculated
better
than
a
bat
in
the
eye
with
a
burnt
stick
from
him
this
was
the
superlative
of
praise
making
good
money
at
any
rate
are
said
mynors
reminds
me
ephraim
remarked
gruffly
dost
think
getting
wed
i
not
much
for
long
engagements
and
so
i
tell
ye
he
threw
a
cold
glance
sideways
at
anna
the
idea
penetrated
her
heart
like
a
stab
wants
to
get
me
out
of
the
house
said
mynors
surprised
at
the
question
and
the
tone
and
looking
at
anna
as
if
for
an
explanation
had
scarcely
thought
of
that
what
does
anna
say
do
know
she
murmured
and
then
more
bravely
in
a
louder
voice
and
with
a
smile
sooner
the
better
she
thought
in
her
bitter
and
painful
resentment
he
wants
me
to
go
go
i
will
henry
tactfully
passed
on
to
another
phase
of
the
subject
met
sutton
yesterday
and
he
was
telling
me
of
price
house
up
at
toft
end
it
belonged
to
price
but
of
course
it
was
mortgaged
up
to
the
hilt
the
mortgagees
have
taken
possession
and
sutton
said
it
would
be
to
let
cheap
at
christmas
of
course
willie
and
old
sarah
vodrey
the
housekeeper
will
clear
out
i
was
thinking
it
might
do
for
us
it
not
a
bad
sort
of
house
or
rather
it
wo
be
when
it
repaired
will
they
ask
for
it
ephraim
inquired
or
it
a
nice
large
house
four
bedrooms
and
a
very
good
garden
bedrooms
the
miser
exclaimed
dost
want
wi
four
bedrooms
you
have
for
keep
a
servant
we
should
keep
a
servant
mynors
said
with
calm
politeness
could
get
one
o
them
new
houses
up
by
th
park
for
fifteen
pounds
as
would
do
you
well
enough
the
miser
protested
against
these
dreams
of
extravagance
do
care
for
that
part
of
the
town
said
mynors
too
new
for
my
taste
after
tea
when
henry
and
anna
went
out
for
the
saturday
evening
stroll
mynors
suddenly
suggested
not
go
up
and
look
through
that
house
of
price
it
seem
like
turning
them
out
if
we
happen
to
take
it
she
asked
them
out
willie
is
bound
to
leave
it
what
use
is
it
to
him
besides
it
in
the
hands
of
the
mortgagees
now
why
we
take
it
just
as
well
as
anybody
else
if
it
suits
us
anna
had
no
reply
and
she
surrendered
herself
placidly
enough
to
his
will
nevertheless
she
could
not
entirely
banish
a
misgiving
that
willie
price
was
again
to
be
victimised
infinitely
more
disturbing
than
this
illogical
sensation
however
was
the
instinctive
and
sure
knowledge
revealed
in
a
flash
that
her
father
wished
to
be
rid
of
her
so
implacable
then
was
his
animosity
against
her
never
never
had
she
been
so
deeply
hurt
the
wound
in
fact
was
so
severe
that
at
first
she
felt
only
a
numbness
that
reduced
everything
to
unimportance
robbing
her
of
volition
she
walked
up
to
toft
end
as
if
walking
in
her
sleep
price
house
sometimes
called
priory
house
in
accordance
with
a
legend
that
a
priory
had
once
occupied
the
site
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
mean
and
struggling
suburb
of
toft
end
which
was
flung
up
the
hillside
like
a
ragged
scarf
built
of
red
brick
towards
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
with
small
evenly
disposed
windows
and
a
chimney
stack
at
either
side
it
looked
westward
over
the
town
smoke
towards
a
horizon
of
hills
it
had
a
long
narrow
garden
which
ran
parallel
with
the
road
behind
it
adjoining
was
a
small
disused
potworks
already
advanced
in
decay
on
the
north
side
and
enclosed
by
a
brick
wall
which
surrounded
also
the
garden
was
a
small
orchard
of
sterile
and
withered
fruit
trees
in
parts
the
wall
had
crumpled
under
the
assaults
of
generations
of
boys
and
from
the
orchard
through
the
gaps
could
be
seen
an
expanse
of
field
with
a
few
abandoned
scattered
over
it
these
shafts
imperfectly
protected
by
ruinous
masonry
presented
an
appearance
strangely
sinister
and
forlorn
raising
visions
in
the
mind
of
dark
and
mysterious
depths
peopled
with
miserable
ghosts
of
those
who
had
toiled
there
in
the
days
when
to
be
a
miner
was
to
be
a
slave
the
whole
place
house
and
garden
looked
ashamed
and
sad
with
a
shabby
mournfulness
acquired
gradually
from
its
inmates
during
many
years
but
nevertheless
the
house
was
substantial
and
the
air
on
that
height
fresh
and
pure
mynors
rang
in
vain
at
the
front
door
and
then
they
walked
round
the
house
to
the
orchard
and
discovered
sarah
vodrey
taking
in
clothes
from
a
line
a
diminutive
and
wasted
figure
with
scanty
grey
hair
a
tiny
face
permanently
soured
and
bony
hands
contorted
by
rheumatism
rheumatism
that
bad
she
said
in
response
to
greetings
can
scarce
move
about
and
this
house
is
a
regular
barracks
to
keep
clean
no
willie
not
in
he
at
th
works
as
usual
saturday
like
any
other
day
i
by
myself
here
all
day
and
every
day
but
i
reckon
be
flitting
soon
and
me
lived
here
year
praise
god
there
a
mansion
up
there
for
me
at
last
and
not
sorry
shall
i
be
when
he
calls
must
be
very
lonely
for
you
miss
vodrey
said
mynors
he
knew
exactly
how
to
speak
to
this
dame
who
lived
her
life
like
a
fly
between
two
panes
of
glass
and
who
could
find
room
in
her
head
for
only
three
ideas
namely
that
god
and
herself
were
on
terms
of
intimacy
that
she
was
and
had
always
been
indispensable
to
the
price
family
and
that
her
social
status
was
far
above
that
of
a
servant
a
pity
you
never
married
mynors
added
marry
what
would
ha
done
without
me
no
i
none
for
marriage
and
never
was
i
be
shamed
to
be
like
some
o
them
spinsters
down
at
chapel
always
hanging
round
on
the
of
a
service
to
catch
that
there
young
sargent
the
new
minister
it
a
sign
of
a
hard
winter
miss
terrick
when
the
hay
runs
after
the
horse
that
what
i
say
tellwright
and
myself
are
in
search
of
a
house
mynors
gently
interrupted
the
flow
and
gave
her
a
peculiar
glance
which
she
appreciated
heard
you
and
willie
were
going
to
leave
here
and
so
we
came
up
just
to
look
over
the
place
if
it
quite
convenient
to
you
i
understand
ye
she
said
in
but
ye
mun
tak
things
as
ye
find
miss
terrick
dismal
and
unkempt
the
interior
of
the
house
matched
the
exterior
the
carpets
were
threadbare
the
discoloured
hung
loose
on
the
walls
the
ceilings
were
almost
black
the
paint
had
nearly
been
rubbed
away
from
the
woodwork
the
exhausted
furniture
looked
as
if
it
would
fall
to
pieces
in
despair
if
compelled
to
face
the
threatened
ordeal
of
an
but
to
anna
the
rooms
were
surprisingly
large
and
there
seemed
so
many
of
them
it
was
as
if
she
were
exploring
an
immense
abode
like
a
castle
with
odd
chambers
continually
showing
themselves
in
unexpected
places
the
upper
story
was
even
less
inviting
than
the
barer
more
chill
utterly
comfortless
is
the
best
bedroom
said
miss
vodrey
a
rare
big
room
too
it
not
used
now
slept
here
willie
sleeps
at
back
very
nice
room
mynors
agreed
blandly
and
measured
it
as
he
had
done
all
the
others
with
a
entering
the
figures
in
his
anna
eye
wandered
uneasily
across
the
room
with
its
dismantled
bed
and
decrepit
mahogany
suite
glad
he
hanged
himself
at
the
works
and
not
here
she
thought
then
she
looked
out
at
the
window
a
splendid
view
she
remarked
to
mynors
she
saw
that
he
had
taken
a
fancy
to
the
house
the
sagacious
fellow
esteemed
it
not
as
it
was
but
as
it
would
be
the
outer
walls
pointed
the
garden
stocked
everything
cleansed
brightened
renewed
and
there
was
indeed
much
to
be
said
for
his
fancy
the
house
was
large
with
plenty
of
ground
the
boundary
wall
secured
that
privacy
which
young
husbands
and
young
wives
instinctively
demand
the
outlook
was
unlimited
the
air
the
purest
in
the
five
towns
and
the
rent
was
low
because
the
great
majority
of
those
who
could
afford
such
a
house
would
never
deign
to
exist
in
a
quarter
so
and
unfashionable
after
leaving
the
house
they
continued
their
walk
up
the
hill
and
then
turned
off
to
the
left
on
the
high
road
from
hanbridge
to
moorthorne
the
venerable
but
not
dignified
town
lay
below
them
a
huddled
medley
of
brown
brick
under
a
thick
black
cloud
of
smoke
the
gold
angel
of
the
gleamed
in
the
evening
light
and
the
dark
squat
tower
of
the
parish
church
sole
relic
of
the
past
stood
out
grim
and
obdurate
amid
the
featureless
buildings
which
surrounded
it
to
the
north
and
east
miles
of
moorland
defaced
by
collieries
and
murky
hamlets
ran
to
the
horizon
across
the
great
field
at
their
feet
a
figure
slouched
along
past
the
abandoned
they
both
recognised
the
man
willie
price
going
home
said
mynors
looks
tired
she
said
she
was
relieved
that
they
had
not
met
him
at
the
house
say
mynors
began
earnestly
after
a
pause
should
we
get
married
soon
since
the
old
gentleman
seems
rather
to
expect
it
been
rather
awkward
lately
has
he
this
was
the
only
reference
made
by
mynors
to
her
father
temper
she
nodded
soon
she
asked
i
was
just
thinking
suppose
for
the
sake
of
argument
this
house
turns
out
all
right
i
could
get
it
thoroughly
done
up
much
before
the
middle
of
january
could
begin
till
these
people
had
moved
suppose
we
said
early
in
february
you
be
ready
by
that
time
yes
she
answered
could
be
ready
why
should
we
fix
february
then
the
question
of
agnes
she
said
and
there
will
always
be
the
question
of
agnes
your
father
will
have
to
get
a
housekeeper
you
and
i
will
be
able
to
see
after
little
agnes
never
fear
so
with
tenderness
in
his
voice
he
reassured
her
on
that
point
not
february
she
reflected
not
as
father
wants
me
out
of
the
house
it
was
agreed
taken
the
priory
subject
to
your
approval
henry
said
less
than
a
fortnight
later
from
that
time
he
invariably
referred
to
the
place
as
the
priory
it
was
on
the
very
night
after
this
eager
announcement
that
the
approaching
tragedy
came
one
step
nearer
beatrice
in
a
modest
with
a
white
cloak
excited
hurried
and
important
ran
in
to
speak
to
anna
the
carriage
was
waiting
outside
she
and
her
father
and
mother
had
to
attend
a
very
important
dinner
at
the
house
at
hillport
in
connection
with
sutton
impending
mayoralty
old
sarah
vodrey
had
just
sent
down
a
girl
to
say
that
she
was
unwell
and
would
be
grateful
if
sutton
or
beatrice
would
visit
her
it
was
a
most
unreasonable
time
for
such
a
summons
but
sarah
was
a
fidgety
old
crotchet
and
knew
how
frightfully
sutton
was
would
anna
mind
going
up
to
toft
end
and
would
anna
come
out
to
the
carriage
and
personally
assure
sutton
that
old
sarah
should
be
attended
to
if
not
beatrice
was
afraid
her
mother
would
take
it
into
her
head
to
do
something
stupid
very
good
of
you
anna
said
sutton
when
anna
went
outside
with
beatrice
i
think
i
better
go
myself
the
poor
old
thing
may
feel
slighted
if
i
do
and
beatrice
can
well
take
my
place
at
this
affair
at
hillport
which
i
no
mind
for
she
was
already
half
out
of
the
carriage
of
the
kind
said
anna
firmly
pushing
her
back
shall
be
delighted
to
go
and
do
what
i
can
right
anna
said
the
alderman
from
the
darkness
of
the
carriage
where
his
gleamed
said
you
go
and
much
obliged
to
ye
expect
it
will
be
nothing
said
beatrice
as
the
vehicle
drove
off
has
served
mother
this
trick
before
now
as
anna
opened
the
of
the
priory
she
discerned
a
figure
amid
the
rank
bushes
which
had
been
allowed
to
grow
till
they
almost
met
across
the
narrow
path
leading
to
the
front
door
of
the
house
it
was
a
thick
and
mysterious
night
such
a
night
as
death
chooses
and
anna
jumped
in
vague
terror
at
the
apparition
there
said
a
voice
sharply
me
said
anna
vodrey
sent
down
to
ask
sutton
to
come
up
and
see
her
but
sutton
had
an
engagement
so
i
came
instead
the
figure
moved
forward
it
was
willie
price
he
peered
into
her
face
and
she
could
see
the
mortal
pallor
of
his
cheeks
he
exclaimed
miss
tellwright
is
it
will
ye
come
in
miss
tellwright
she
followed
him
with
beating
heart
alarmed
apprehensive
the
front
door
stood
wide
open
and
at
the
far
end
of
the
gloomy
passage
a
faint
light
shone
from
the
open
door
of
the
kitchen
way
he
said
in
the
large
bare
kitchen
sarah
vodrey
sat
limp
and
with
closed
eyes
in
an
old
close
to
the
fireless
range
the
window
which
gave
on
to
the
street
was
open
through
that
window
sarah
in
her
extremity
had
called
the
child
who
ran
down
to
sutton
on
the
deal
table
were
a
dirty
cup
and
saucer
a
bread
butter
and
a
lighted
candle
sole
illumination
of
the
chamber
come
home
and
i
find
this
he
said
daunted
for
a
moment
by
the
scene
of
misery
anna
could
say
nothing
find
this
he
repeated
as
if
accusing
god
of
spitefulness
and
he
lifted
the
candle
to
show
the
apparently
insensible
form
of
the
woman
sarah
wrinkled
and
seamed
face
had
the
flush
of
fever
and
the
features
were
drawn
into
the
expression
of
a
terrible
anxiety
her
hands
hung
loose
she
breathed
like
a
dog
after
a
run
wanted
her
to
have
the
doctor
yesterday
he
said
she
would
ever
since
you
and
mynors
called
she
been
cleaning
the
house
down
she
said
you
happen
be
coming
again
soon
and
the
place
was
fit
to
be
seen
no
use
me
arguing
with
her
had
better
run
for
a
doctor
anna
said
was
just
going
off
when
you
came
she
been
complaining
more
of
her
rheumatism
and
pain
in
her
hips
lately
now
fetch
macpherson
and
call
at
our
house
and
say
i
shall
stay
here
all
night
wait
a
moment
seeing
that
he
was
exhausted
from
lack
of
food
she
cut
a
thick
piece
of
this
as
you
go
she
said
ca
eat
it
choke
me
it
choke
you
she
said
got
to
swallow
it
child
of
a
hundred
sorrows
he
must
be
treated
as
a
child
as
soon
as
willie
was
gone
she
took
off
her
hat
and
jacket
and
lit
a
lamp
there
was
no
gas
in
the
kitchen
that
light
the
old
woman
asked
peevishly
rousing
herself
and
sitting
up
doubt
i
be
late
with
willie
tea
eh
miss
terrick
what
amiss
not
quite
well
miss
vodrey
anna
answered
you
show
me
your
room
i
see
you
into
bed
without
giving
her
a
moment
for
hesitation
anna
seized
the
feeble
creature
under
the
arms
and
so
coaxing
supporting
carrying
got
her
to
bed
at
length
she
lay
on
the
narrow
mattress
panting
exhausted
it
was
sarah
final
effort
anna
lit
fires
in
the
kitchen
and
in
the
bedroom
and
when
willie
returned

the
doctor
curtly
in
the
kitchen
when
he
had
finished
his
examination
of
sarah
neighbour
for
and
i
send
a
nurse
up
from
the
early
morning
not
that
it
will
be
the
least
use

must
have
been
dying
for
the
last
two
days
at
least
she
got
pericarditis
and
pleurisy
she
breathing
i
do

how
many
to
the
minute
and
her
temperature
is
just
about
as
high
as
it
can
be
it
all
follows
from
rheumatism
and
then
taking
cold
gross
carelessness
and
neglect
all
through
i
no
patience
with
such
work
he
turned
angrily
to
willie
do
know
what
on
earth
you
were
thinking
of
price
not
to
send
for
me
earlier
willie
abashed
and
guilty
found
nothing
to
say
his
eye
had
the
meek
wistfulness
of
holman

wanted
her
to
have

defending
him
with
warmth
she
would
he
is
out
at
the
works
all
day
till
late
at
night
how
was
he
to
know
how
she
was
she
could
walk
about
the
tall
doctor
glanced
at
anna
in
surprise
and
at
once
modified
his
tone
he
said
the
curious
thing
it
passes
me
how
she
managed
to
get
about
but
there
is
no
knowing
what
an
obstinate
woman
wo
force
herself
to
do
i
send
the
medicine
up
and
come
along
myself
with
the
nurse
early
meantime
keep
carefully
to
my
instructions
that
night
remains
for
ever
fixed
in
anna
memory
the
grim
rooms
echoing
and
shadowy
the
countless
journeys
up
and
down
dark
stairs
and
passages
willie
sitting
always
immovable
in
the
kitchen
idle
because
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
sarah
incessantly
panting
on
the
the
hired
woman
from
up
the
street
buxom
kindly
useful
but
fatuous
in
the
endless
monotony
of
her
commiserations
towards
morning
sarah
vodrey
gave
sign
of
a
desire
to
talk
fought
the
fight
she
murmured
to
anna
who
alone
was
in
the
bedroom
with
her
fought
the
fight
i
kept
the
faith
in
that
box
there
ye

a
purse

that

pay
for
the
funeral
and
willie
must
have
what

ha
been
more
for
the
lad
but
he
never
paid
me
no

this
two
years
past
i
never
troubled
him
tell
willie
that
anna
said
impetuously
bless
ye
no
said
the
dying
drudge
and
then
seemed
to
doze
anna
went
to
the
kitchen
and
sent
the
woman
upstairs
is
she
asked
willie
without
stirring
anna
shook
her
head

nor
me

longer

said
smiling
wearily

you
the
next
day
sarah
vodrey
died
she
who
had
never
lived
save
in
the
fetters
of
slavery
and
fanaticism
after
fifty
years
of
ceaseless
labour
she
had
gained
the
affection
of
one
person
and
enough
money
to
pay
for
her
own
funeral
willie

took
a
cheap
lodging
with
the

who
had
been
called
in
on
the
night
of
sarah

was

in

the

lost
their

in
a
medley
of

chapter
xiii
the
bazaar
the
wesleyan
bazaar
the
greatest
undertaking
of
its
kind
ever
known
in
bursley
gradually
became
a
cloud
which
filled
the
entire
social
horizon
sutton
organiser
of
the
stall
pressed
all
her
friends
into
the
service
and
a
fortnight
after
the
death
of
sarah
vodrey
anna
and
even
agnes
gave
much
of
their
spare
time
to
the
work
which
was
carried
on
under
pressure
increasing
daily
as
the
final
moments
approached
this
was
well
for
anna
in
that
it
diverted
her
thoughts
by
keeping
her
energies
fully
engaged
one
morning
however
it
occurred
to
sutton
to
reflect
that
anna
at
such
a
period
of
life
should
be
otherwise
employed
anna
had
called
at
the
suttons
to
deliver
some
finished
garments
dear
she
said
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
all
this
industry
but
i
been
thinking
that
as
you
are
to
be
married
in
february
you
ought
to
be
preparing
your
things
things
anna
repeated
idly
and
then
she
remembered
phrase
on
the
hill
you
be
ready
by
that
time
said
sutton
possibly
you
been
getting
forward
with
them
on
the
quiet
me
said
anna
with
an
air
of
interest
meant
to
ask
you
before
is
it
the
bride
place
to
provide
all
the
and
that
sort
of
thing
was
in
my
day
but
those
things
alter
so
the
bride
took
all
the
to
her
husband
and
as
many
clothes
for
herself
as
would
last
a
year
that
was
the
rule
we
used
to
stitch
everything
at
home
in
those
days
everything
and
we
had
what
we
called
a
bottom
drawer
to
store
them
in
as
soon
as
a
girl
passed
her
fifteenth
birthday
she
began
to
sew
for
the
bottom
drawer
but
all
those
things
change
so
i
dare
say
it
different
now
much
will
it
cost
to
buy
everything
do
you
think
anna
asked
just
then
beatrice
entered
the
room
anna
is
inquiring
how
much
it
will
cost
to
buy
her
trousseau
and
the
what
do
you
say
beatrice
replied
without
any
hesitation
couple
of
hundred
at
least
sutton
reading
anna
face
smiled
reassuringly
bee
i
dare
say
you
could
do
it
on
a
hundred
with
care
anna
should
anna
want
to
do
it
with
care
beatrice
asked
curtly
anna
went
straight
across
the
road
to
her
father
and
asked
him
for
a
hundred
pounds
of
her
own
money
she
had
not
spoken
to
him
save
under
necessity
since
the
evening
spent
at
the
suttons
afoot
now
he
questioned
savagely
must
buy
things
for
the
wedding
clothes
and
things
father

all
over
bosley
i
say
it
isna
thy
place

and
let
that
be
sufficient
go
and
get
dinner
it
nigh
on
twelve
now
that
evening
when
agnes
had
gone
to
bed
she
resumed
the
struggle
i
must
have
that
hundred
pounds
i
really
must
i
mean
it
means
what
mean
i
must
have
a
hundred
pounds
advise
thee
to
tak
care
o
thy
tongue
my
lass
means

all
at
once
she
pursued
he
gazed
at
her
glowering
shanna
give
it
thee
it
henry
place
for
buy
th
it
is
her
voice
broke
but
only
for
an
instant
asking
you
for
my
own
money
you
seem
to
want
to
make
me
miserable
just
before
my
wedding
wish
to
god
thou
never
seen
henry
mynors
it
given
thee
pride
and
made
thee
undutiful
only
asking
you
for
my
own
money
her
calm
insistence
maddened
him
jumping
up
from
his
chair
he
stamped
out
of
the
room
and
she
heard
him
strike
a
match
in
his
office
presently
he
returned
and
threw
angrily
on
to
the
table
in
front
of
her
a
and
the
she
had
always
kept
herself
for
convenience
of
paying
into
the
bank
he
said
scornfully
thy
traps
and
speak
to
me
again
i
wash
my
hands
of
ye
tak
and
do
what
a
mind
chuck
thy
money
into
th
cut
for
aught
i
care
the
next
evening
henry
came
up
she
observed
that
his
face
had
a
grave
look
but
intent
on
her
own
difficulties
she
did
not
remark
on
it
and
proceeded
at
once
to
do
what
she
resolved
to
do
it
was
a
cold
night
in
november
yet
the
miser
wrathfully
sullen
chose
to
sit
in
his
office
without
a
fire
agnes
was
working
sums
in
the
kitchen
anna
began
had
a
difficulty
with
father
and
i
must
tell
you
about
the
wedding
i
hope
he
said
was
about
money
of
course
henry
i
ca
get
married
without
a
lot
of
money
not
he
inquired
my
own
things
to
get
she
said
i
all
the
to
buy
you
buy
the
do
you
she
saw
that
he
was
relieved
by
that
information
course
well
i
told
father
i
must
have
a
hundred
pounds
and
he
would
give
it
me
and
when
i
stuck
to
him
he
got
angry
you
know
he
ca
bear
to
see
money
spent
and
at
last
he
get
a
little
savage
and
gave
me
my
and
said
he
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
my
money
henry
face
broke
into
a
laugh
and
anna
was
obliged
to
smile
he
said
be
better
want
you
to
tell
me
how
much
i
got
in
the
bank
she
said
only
know
i
always
paying
in
odd
cheques
he
examined
the
three
books
very
tidy
bit
he
said
over
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
so
you
can
draw
cheques
at
your
ease
me
a
cheque
for
twenty
pounds
she
said
and
then
while
he
wrote
after
we
married
i
shall
want
you
to
take
charge
of
all
this
of
course
i
will
do
that
dear
but
your
money
will
be
yours
there
ought
to
be
a
settlement
on
you
still
if
your
father
says
nothing
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
anything
will
say
nothing
now
she
said
never
shown
any
interest
in
it
henry
but
as
we
talking
of
money
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
father
says
i
worth
fifty
thousand
pounds
the
man
of
business
was
astonished
and
enraptured
beyond
measure
his
countenance
shone
with
delight
not
he
protested
formally
what
father
told
me
and
he
made
me
read
a
list
of
shares
and
so
on
will
go
slow
to
begin
with
said
mynors
solemnly
he
had
not
expected
more
than
fifteen
or
twenty
thousand
pounds
and
even
this
sum
had
dazzled
his
imagination
he
was
glad
that
he
had
only
taken
the
house
at
toft
end
on
a
yearly
tenancy
he
now
saw
himself
the
dominant
figure
in
all
the
five
towns
later
in
the
evening
he
disclosed
perfunctorily
the
matter
which
had
been
a
serious
weight
on
his
mind
when
he
entered
the
house
but
which
this
revelation
of
vast
wealth
had
diminished
to
a
trifle
titus
price
had
been
the
treasurer
of
the
building
fund
which
the
bazaar
was
designed
to
assist
mynors
had
assumed
the
position
of
the
dead
man
and
that
day
in
going
through
the
accounts
he
had
discovered
that
a
sum
of
fifty
pounds
was
missing
a
dreadful
thing
for
willie
if
it
gets
about
he
said
tale
of
that
sort
would
follow
him
to
australia
henry
it
is
she
exclaimed
we
must
let
it
get
about
let
us
pay
the
money
ourselves
you
must
enter
it
in
the
books
and
say
nothing
is
impossible
he
said
firmly
ca
alter
the
accounts
at
least
i
ca
alter
the
and
the
vouchers
the
auditor
would
detect
it
in
a
minute
besides
i
should
not
be
doing
my
duty
if
i
kept
a
thing
like
this
from
the
he
at
any
rate
must
know
and
perhaps
the
stewards
you
can
urge
them
to
say
nothing
tell
them
that
you
will
make
it
good
i
will
write
a
cheque
at
once
had
meant
to
find
the
fifty
myself
he
said
it
was
a
peddling
sum
to
him
now
me
pay
half
then
she
asked
you
like
he
urged
smiling
faintly
at
her
eagerness
thing
is
bound
to
be
kept
quiet
it
would
create
such
a
frightful
scandal
poor
old
chap
he
added
carelessly
suppose
he
was
hard
run
and
meant
to
put
it
back
as
they
all
do
mean
but
it
was
useless
for
mynors
to
affect
depression
of
spirits
or
mournful
sympathy
with
the
errors
of
a
dead
sinner
the
fifty
thousand
danced
a
jig
in
his
brain
that
night
anna
was
absorbed
in
contemplating
the
misfortune
of
willie
price
she
prayed
wildly
that
he
might
never
learn
the
full
depth
of
his
fall
the
miserable
robbery
of
sarah
wages
was
buried
for
evermore
and
this
new
delinquency
which
all
would
regard
as
flagrant
sacrilege
must
be
buried
also
a
soul
less
loyal
than
anna
might
have
feared
that
willie
a
forger
had
been
a
party
to
the
embezzlement
but
anna
knew
that
it
could
not
be
so
it
was
characteristic
of
mynors
cautious
prudence
that
the
first
intoxication
having
passed
he
made
no
further
reference
of
any
kind
to
anna
fortune
the
arrangements
for
their
married
life
were
planned
on
a
scale
which
ignored
the
fifty
thousand
pounds
for
both
their
sakes
he
wished
to
avoid
all
friction
with
the
miser
at
any
rate
until
his
status
as
anna
husband
would
enable
him
to
enforce
her
rights
if
that
should
be
necessary
with
dignity
and
effectiveness
he
did
not
precisely
anticipate
trouble
but
the
fact
had
not
escaped
him
that
ephraim
still
held
the
whole
of
anna
securities
he
was
in
no
hurry
to
enlarge
his
borders
he
knew
that
there
were
hours
in
every
day
three
hundred
and
days
in
every
year
and
thirty
good
years
in
life
still
left
to
him
and
therefore
that
there
would
be
ample
time
after
the
wedding
for
the
execution
of
his
purposes
in
regard
to
that
fifty
thousand
pounds
meanwhile
he
told
anna
that
he
had
set
aside
two
hundred
pounds
for
the
purchase
of
furniture
for
the
priory
a
modest
sum
but
he
judged
it
sufficient
his
method
was
to
buy
a
piece
at
a
time
always
but
always
good
the
was
up
and
anna
soon
yielded
to
its
mild
satisfactions
in
the
matter
of
her
trousseau
and
the
anna
having
obtained
the
needed
money
at
so
dear
a
cost
found
yet
another
obstacle
in
the
imminent
bazaar
which
occupied
sutton
and
beatrice
so
completely
that
they
could
not
contrive
any
opportunity
to
assist
her
in
shopping
it
was
decided
between
them
that
every
article
should
be
bought
and
seamed
and
that
the
first
week
of
the
new
year
if
indeed
sutton
survived
the
bazaar
should
be
entirely
and
absolutely
devoted
to
anna
business
at
nights
when
she
had
leisure
to
think
anna
was
astonished
how
during
the
day
she
had
forgotten
her
preoccupations
in
the
activities
precendent
to
the
bazaar
or
in
choosing
furniture
with
mynors
but
she
never
slept
without
thinking
of
willie
price
and
hoping
that
no
further
disaster
might
overtake
him
the
incident
of
the
embezzled
fifty
pounds
had
been
closed
and
she
had
given
a
cheque
for
pounds
to
mynors
he
had
acquainted
the
minister
with
the
facts
and
banks
had
decided
that
the
two
circuit
stewards
must
be
informed
beyond
these
the
scandalous
secret
was
not
to
go
but
anna
wondered
whether
a
secret
shared
by
five
persons
could
long
remain
a
secret
the
bazaar
was
a
triumphant
and
unparalleled
success
and
of
the
seven
stalls
the
stall
stood
first
each
night
in
the
nightly
returns
the
scene
in
the
on
the
fourth
and
final
night
a
saturday
was
as
delirious
and
gay
as
a
carnival
four
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
had
been
raised
up
to
and
it
was
the
impassioned
desire
of
everyone
to
achieve
five
hundred
the
price
of
admission
had
been
reduced
to
threepence
in
order
that
the
artisan
might
enter
and
spend
his
wages
in
an
excellent
cause
the
seven
stalls
ranged
round
the
room
like
so
many
bowers
of
beauty
draped
and
frilled
and
floriated
and
still
laden
with
countless
articles
of
use
and
ornament
were
continually
reinforced
with
purchasers
by
emissaries
canvassing
the
crowd
which
filled
the
middle
of
the
floor
the
horse
was
not
only
taken
to
the
water
but
compelled
to
drink
and
many
a
man
who
outside
would
have
laughed
at
the
risk
of
being
robbed
was
robbed
openly
shamelessly
under
the
gaze
of
ministers
and
bouquets
were
sold
at
a
shilling
each
and
at
the
refreshment
stall
a
glass
of
milk
cost
sixpence
the
noise
rivalled
that
of
a
fair
there
was
no
quiet
anywhere
save
in
the
farthest
recess
of
each
stall
where
the
lady
in
supreme
charge
of
it
like
a
spider
in
the
middle
of
its
web
watched
customers
and
with
equal
cupidity
sutton
at
seven
had
not
returned
from
tea
and
anna
and
beatrice
who
managed
the
stall
in
her
absence
feared
that
she
had
at
last
succumbed
under
the
strain
but
shortly
afterwards
she
hurried
back
breathless
to
her
place
that
anna
it
will
be
reckoned
in
our
returns
she
said
exhibiting
a
piece
of
paper
it
was
ephraim
cheque
for
pounds
promised
months
ago
but
on
a
condition
which
had
not
been
fulfilled
has
the
secret
of
persuading
him
thought
anna
have
i
never
found
it
then
agnes
in
a
new
white
frock
came
up
with
three
shillings
proceeds
of
bouquets
you
must
take
that
to
the
my
pet
said
sutton
i
give
it
to
you
the
child
pleaded
want
your
stall
to
be
the
best
mynors
arrived
next
with
something
concealed
in
he
removed
the
paper
and
showed
in
a
frame
of
crimson
plush
a
common
white
plate
decorated
with
a
simple
band
and
line
and
a
monogram
in
the
centre
anna
blushed
recognising
the
plate
which
she
had
painted
that
afternoon
in
july
at
mynors
works
you
sell
this
mynors
asked
sutton
try
to
said
sutton
doubtfully
not
in
the
secret
it
meant
for
to
sell
it
to
me
said
mynors
she
laughed
will
you
give
couple
of
sovereigns
it
guineas
he
paid
the
money
and
requested
anna
to
keep
the
plate
for
him
at
nine
it
was
announced
that
though
raffling
was
forbidden
the
bazaar
would
be
enlivened
by
an
auction
a
licensed
auctioneer
was
brought
and
the
sale
commenced
the
auctioneer
however
failed
to
attune
himself
to
the
wild
spirit
of
the
hour
and
his
professional
efforts
would
have
resulted
in
a
fiasco
had
not
mynors
perceiving
the
danger
leaped
to
the
platform
and
masterfully
assumed
the
hammer
mynors
surpassed
himself
in
the
kind
of
wit
that
amuses
an
excited
crowd
and
the
auction
soon
monopolised
the
attention
of
the
room
it
was
always
afterwards
remembered
as
the
crowning
success
of
the
bazaar
the
incredible
man
took
ten
pounds
in
twenty
minutes
during
this
episode
anna
who
had
been
left
alone
in
the
stall
first
noticed
willie
price
in
the
room
his
ship
sailed
on
the
monday
but
steerage
passengers
had
to
be
aboard
on
sunday
and
he
was
saying
to
a
few
acquaintances
he
seemed
quite
cheerful
as
he
walked
about
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
chatting
with
this
one
and
that
it
was
the
false
and
hysterical
gaiety
that
precedes
a
final
separation
as
soon
as
he
saw
anna
he
came
towards
her
miss
tellwright
he
said
jauntily
leave
for
liverpool
morning
wish
me
luck
nothing
more
no
word
no
accent
to
recall
the
terrible
but
sublime
past
do
she
answered
they
shook
hands
others
approaching
he
drifted
away
her
glance
followed
him
like
a
beneficent
influence
for
three
days
she
had
carried
in
her
pocket
an
envelope
containing
a
for
a
hundred
pounds
intending
by
some
device
to
force
it
on
him
as
a
parting
gift
now
the
last
chance
was
lost
and
she
had
not
even
attempted
this
difficult
feat
of
charity
such
futility
she
reflected
was
of
a
piece
with
her
life
really
gone
he
has
really
gone
she
kept
repeating
and
yet
knew
well
that
he
had
gone
you
know
what
they
are
saying
anna
said
beatrice
when
after
eleven
the
bazaar
was
closed
to
the
public
and
the
and
their
assistants
were
preparing
to
depart
their
movements
hastened
by
the
stern
aspect
of
the
keeper
what
said
anna
and
in
the
same
moment
guessed
say
old
titus
price
embezzled
fifty
pounds
from
the
building
fund
and
henry
made
it
up
privately
so
that
there
should
be
a
scandal
just
fancy
do
you
believe
it
the
secret
was
abroad
she
looked
round
the
room
and
saw
it
in
every
face
says
anna
demanded
fiercely
all
over
the
place
miss
dickinson
told
me
will
be
glad
to
know
ladies
mynors
voice
sang
out
from
the
platform
the
total
proceeds
so
far
as
we
can
calculate
them
now
exceed
five
hundred
and
pounds
there
was
clapping
of
hands
which
died
out
suddenly
agnes
anna
called
along
quick
you
as
white
as
a
sheet
sutton
bee
mynors
was
still
occupied
on
the
platform
the
keeper
extinguished
some
of
the
lights
the
bazaar
was
over
canal
chapter
xiv
end
of
a
simple
soul
the
next
morning
at
seven
anna
was
standing
in
the
of
the
priory
the
sun
had
just
risen
the
air
was
cold
roof
and
pavement
were
damp
rain
had
fallen
and
more
was
to
fall
a
door
opened
higher
up
the
street
and
willie
price
came
out
carrying
a
small
bag
he
turned
to
speak
to
some
person
within
the
house
and
then
stepped
forward
as
he
passed
anna
she
sprang
forth
she
cried
had
just
come
up
here
to
see
if
the
workmen
had
locked
up
properly
we
have
some
of
our
new
furniture
in
the
house
you
know
she
was
as
red
as
the
sun
over
hillport
he
glanced
at
her
heard
he
asked
simply
what
she
whispered
my
poor
old
father
i
was
hoping
hoping
you
would
never
know
by
a
common
impulse
they
went
into
the
garden
of
the
priory
and
he
shut
the
door
know
he
repeated
they
took
care
to
tell
me
a
silence
followed
that
your
luggage
she
inquired
he
lifted
up
the
handbag
and
nodded
of
it
he
said
only
an
emigrant
got
a
note
here
for
you
she
said
should
have
posted
it
to
the
steamer
but
now
you
can
take
it
yourself
i
want
you
not
to
read
it
till
you
get
to
melbourne
well
he
said
and
crumpled
the
proffered
envelope
into
his
pocket
he
was
not
thinking
of
the
note
at
all
presently
he
asked
did
you
tell
me
about
my
father
if
i
had
to
hear
it
sooner
have
heard
it
from
you
must
try
to
forget
it
she
urged
him
are
not
your
father
wish
i
had
never
been
born
he
said
wish
i
gone
to
prison
now
was
the
moment
when
if
ever
the
mother
influence
should
be
exerted
a
man
she
said
softly
did
the
best
i
could
for
you
i
shall
always
think
of
you
in
australia
getting
on
she
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
she
said
again
passionately
shall
always
remember
you
always
the
hand
with
which
he
touched
her
arm
shook
like
an
old
man
hand
as
their
eyes
met
in
an
intense
and
painful
gaze
to
her
at
least
it
was
revealed
that
they
were
lovers
what
he
had
learnt
in
that
instant
can
only
be
guessed
from
his
next
action
anna
ran
out
of
the
garden
into
the
street
and
so
home
never
looking
behind
to
see
if
he
pursued
his
way
to
the
station
some
may
argue
that
anna
knowing
she
loved
another
man
ought
not
to
have
married
mynors
but
she
did
not
reason
thus
such
a
notion
never
even
occurred
to
her
she
had
promised
to
marry
mynors
and
she
married
him
nothing
else
was
possible
she
who
had
never
failed
in
duty
did
not
fail
then
she
who
had
always
submitted
and
bowed
the
head
submitted
and
bowed
the
head
then
she
had
sucked
in
with
her
mother
milk
the
profound
truth
that
a
woman
life
is
always
a
renunciation
greater
or
less
hers
by
chance
was
greater
facing
the
future
calmly
and
genially
she
took
oath
with
herself
to
be
a
good
wife
to
the
man
whom
with
all
his
excellences
she
had
never
loved
her
thoughts
often
dwelt
lovingly
on
willie
price
whom
she
deemed
to
be
pursuing
in
australia
an
honourable
and
successful
career
quickened
at
the
outset
by
her
hundred
pounds
this
vision
of
him
was
her
stay
but
neither
she
nor
anyone
in
the
five
towns
or
elsewhere
ever
heard
of
willie
price
again
and
well
might
none
hear
the
abandoned
pitshaft
does
not
deliver
up
its
secret
and
so
the
bank
of
england
is
the
richer
by
a
hundred
pounds
unclaimed
and
the
world
the
poorer
by
a
simple
and
meek
soul
stung
to
revolt
only
in
its
last
